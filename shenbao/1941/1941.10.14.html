<p>物價之變遷恰如一髮之動可以牽及全身，生活上須臾無可逃避之影響，其關係國計民生至深且鉅，洵屬當今世界經濟機構中之焦點。是以各國無不致力於物價之管制，以期貫現穩定之水準而爲人民生活之尺度。</p>
<p>一年來我國物價之飛漲誠開世界空前之紀錄。除未步武第一次世界大戰時俄之盧布與德之馬克之崩潰。而有其特殊之原因外，若與今日交戰國或非交戰國之物價相較，何啻天壤之別！我人前撰文闡述物價變遷之理由，並提供弭牛物價之管見，聊以爲民請命云爾。今茲討論是問題者日多，名言讜論，琳琅滿目·政府且已採取若干步驟以解除民困，行見百尺竿頭，將必有更進步之設施，以謀全民族之福利。</p>
<p>茲將重慶成都二地之物價爲簡括之比較而說明其變遷之特性，以證我人前說之不謬。先觀財政部公布之重慶勞動階級零售物價指數，以一九三七年上半年爲基年，所得指數如下：一九三八年二月—一〇四·二；一九三九年二月—一七四·七；一九四〇年二月—三〇五·四；同年七月—四四九·八；同年九月—六九五·〇；同年十月—七四四·九；同年十一月—一。〇〇七·六；同年十二月—一，二二七·六；一九四一年一月—一，一四七·九；同年二月—一，二四七·一。再觀成都勞動階級生活指數，以一九三七年二月至六月爲基年，所得之總指數如下：一九三八年平均—九五·四；一九三九年平均—一二四·七；一九四〇年二月—二〇九·一；同年九月—四八八·五；同年十月—七一五·三；同年十一月—八〇六·入；同年十二月—七八五·六；一九四一年一月—八九四·八；同年二月—九八七·〇。由上述二項指數言之，其在漲之趨勢皆自一九四〇年始。若就成都糧食一項編製，其基年時期與前同，所得之指數爲九〇·四；一一二·六；一九六·四；四三九·、五；七六六·六；八二七·〇；八三三·三；九六九·七；一，〇六三·六—其狂漲趨勢更爲顯著。若言重慶之一九四一年二月米價。較諸戰前飛漲二十倍，而較諸一九三九年二月亦已漲十七倍。</p>
<p>基於上述指數以及其他後方之物價而言，其飛漲理由殊非可以常理測之，蓋此時期內軍事政治經濟等環境皆極穩定而說明數點於下。以貨幣發行言。財政部估計一九四一年初之發行額較諸一九三七年七月僅增加五倍至五倍半，而於同時期內重慶之零售物價飛漲十一倍，足徵物價之漲爲因而貨幣之增發則爲果也。設指外滙高漲爲我國物價飛漲之主因，則可引香港之物價爲比較而鑒定之。當一九四一年一月時，以一元港幣折合之國幣在香港可購置較重慶二倍之猪油，三倍之米，四倍半之鹽等等由此可見法幣在國外之購買力反强於國內者，此亦各國貨幣所未有之特性。有謂運輸費用之增加爲在漲之理由，則更不足置信，蓋太半商品運輸全恃苦力與牛馬爲之，而是項運價在四川境內僅漲百分之一百五十左右。即以汽車運輸而言，所漲不過百分之二百四十　惟重慶之零售物價則已漲百分之四百五十。是以運輸費用絕非物價在漲之因素。有謂工業製造品爲糧價在漲之要素，是又爲昧於現實之說無疑。蓋自指數觀之，自一九四〇年三月起重要製造品如衣服等已趨下落，緣人民之購買力盡爲糧食所吸收，絕無餘力購置製造品矣。</p>
<p>綜上以言·大後方物價之在漲　除操縱壟斷外，殊無其他理由可以自圓其說。惟與滬市所不同者，大後方物品成本自較滬市爲高，且空襲與運輸上之損失以及管理費之高漲，皆爲增加物價之要素而可邀人民之諒解者。顧泰半之飛漲，則仍爲投機性之操縱，與滬市初無二致·政府固已洞悉底蘊，而已三令五申取締之、誠盼雷厲風行，以收統制之實效而利民生，此固我人所馨香禱祝者也。</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、漲風仍熾、如英美金鎊各漲　十元、英金票升三元、美金票因用作荷糖結款甚繁、一度發現三十五　二角之空前價、最後爲三十三元半、比上週飛漲五元八角、此種漲風、殊不應有、蓋使人可誤會到法幣尺寸有如是之變化、不得不疑美政府此决凍結中日資金、尙留此可作變相的美滙、機亂市面、且荷糖連日有大量進口、亦連日有大量轉口、滔滔不絕、實以上海美鈔作買賣、安得不使美鈔大漲而特漲、美方熟視無覩、使人不無懷疑凍結本是一種生意經、香港票亦不乏需要、市價繼續猛漲、日金票漲勢亦厲、晚市高至二元六角七分、朝鮮票亦升至二元一角一分、此外如　加坡票等亦莫不趨漲云、</p>
<p>外匯昨日市况、中央與滙豐兩掛牌勿動、滙豐小櫃檯價如故、英美滙黑黑市步緊益劇、空前緊價層見疊出、乃不准申請之進口洋行猛扒益切、竟向某私人結得價僅三元六八七五、後三元六二五有　十萬美元求扒頭寸、難獲對手、市勢更祇緊不回、直至晚收、英滙亦緊至二辦士一八七五、美滙三元六二五、（仍有求無供）比上週六午收英緊〇六二五、美緊三七五云、</p>

<p>廠布　昨市先平繼漲、乃因實銷雖遭阻塞、而外滙縮勢日見加緊、刺激人心、空戶　力扒補、故布價晨市平平、午後暴騰、粗細布斜紋漲每疋五角至一元半、漂染布漲一元左右、絨布市勢平和、本街成交八百餘件、囤戶吸辦獨多、</p>
<p>東布　因黃金飛騰、雙馬紗激漲停板、取引所之各月份期布亦狂漲每疋三元四角至四元、後市遠月僅拍頭盤、本月份至二盤敲六十五元而止、人心動盪、　於極點、蓋以貨運旣　不開放、今之漲停板、或即明日之跌停板亦屬可能、故現貨漲勢較緩、中擋各牌細布細斜祇升一　元、龍頭細布　單最高做開六十八元、收市稍回為六十七元六角、較漲三元六角、四君子嗶嘰新單二元四角四分半、亦猛漲每碼一角許、今日有東疋九十件運香　、四件運暹　、</p>

<p>與其說是做買賣……何如說是賭大小</p>
<p>雖說又告漲停板……見慣不算一回事</p>
<p>紗市又復轉趨上升、目漲風頗熾、此因黃金飛勝、允使投機的活躍、買氣重生、市般乃節節前進、但實際交易、因報關不准裝運、統行絕跡、昨日成交一萬一千零零一包、據說一萬二千包、盡是投機生意、倒是一包、爲內地幫辦去、看到這種情形、何必說做生意、爽氣說是「賭大小、比輸贏」、倒不失爲老實舉動、</p>
<p>雖說紗布絲針織物、俱不得報關出口、然而是「特許的」依然可裝運、故昨日有日紗八十件運暹邏、十件運香港、實則何必如此做法、即使名爲華廠紗布、經過染織廠手、那一件不是那個貨、不要說染貨、白坯亦何嘗不如此、內地的假痴假呆、海上的裝腔做勢、大家有道回事罷了、那更不必假戲眞做、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因週末大落、人氣不佳、首盤即下四十三元、爲一千九百六十元、此時情况平庸、在一千九百七八十元之間、會見一度徘徊、繼以現金在跳、人心激昂、即漲出二千元關外、然氣勢尙和緩、迨至取引所三收盤致上升、塲中買戶活躍、檯面乾枯、市盤逐步前進至一千九百九十五元、午收盤爲一千九百八十五元、二十支雙馬高價爲二千　百零三元、低價爲一千九百六十元、</p>
<p>午後開盤漲勢殊劇、因現金　力　强、檯面上買者紛至　初開一千九百九十五元、然伸手一致向裏、叫喊聲大震、一霎間漲至二千一百零三元、宣吿漲停板、取引所紗布亦一致橫跳漲停板、一時人心惶惶、市傳淪陷區日紗可通行、於是變馬市塲暗盤交易依然興盛、絡續而昂至二千一百五十元、最後價爲二千一百四十二元、於晨初首盤價一千九百六十元、高低相差一百九十元、如斯情形、賺錢者當然精神振作、虧蝕者不知如何、近來在升在降、使人膽寒也、然默測棉紗之趨勢、仍在怒濤駭浪中、因爲有一部份風浪越大、做輸贏史爲起勁也、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市　微疲後而激騰、竟又高漲停板、其中堅俏之波盪、引起空頭極大之恐慌、當晨初開出、先以廠單趨軟、人心大都向下、浮多脫手、十月份爲　八三〇元開盤、軋小三十五元、入後突以黑滙暴縮、廠單首先影響激騰、一般虛弱之空頭、可能經此打擊、蓋觀前途一時殊鮮利空消息、故一經上升、即相爭逃命扒補、市氣飛黃騰達、期現連襟力漲、乃造你漲我騰之氣燄、與全日高低差達一百三十元之多、十一月份爲一八三二元做開、十二月份爲一八七〇元開盤、午收已各升十餘兀至六十餘元不等、午後走勢更勁、買戶之拉提尤烈、現紗開出即吿漲停板、期紗逐步跟蹤、遠期頭盤亦均漲停板、近期至二盤乃亦漲停板、惟十一月期本須高出十月期、而以週末漲跌之參差、故其中雖各停板、乃爲十一月份之價格最低、買戶需常注意、結果各以最高之停板、行市收盤各升一百元有奇、茲列表於後、</p>

<h3 id="c37">昨日市塲畸形變態　金融界不予重視　非必需品請外匯無結果　搜購美金票致牽動市面　日用品結匯有充分供給 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>平準會供給本市必需品外滙、價格仍爲美金一元、折合法幣十八元六角、但昨晨黑市美金票價格、竟抬漲至三十元上下、聞爲本市不獲平準會供給外匯之非必需品進口商人、極力　購美金票所致、</p>
<p>昨市變動不足驚異</p>
<p>查上海江海關因環境關係、對非常時期禁止進口物品辦法、迄未遵照政府法令實施禁止進口、凡政府禁止輪入之奢侈品半奢侈品及非必需品、仍得向江海關報關進口行銷、是項商人祗顧本身利益、依然定購運滬銷售、並曾向　準會請願供給外匯、自爲拒絕供給後、竟向各出口商私相授受買賣外滙、以致造成所謂之「畸形外滙」、但此種現象、爲一時性質、與上海整個滙市無關、</p>
<p>非必需品請滙被駁</p>
<p>據經濟界稱、黑滙及美金票之劇縮、實爲意料所及、因自平準會於上月停止供給黑市外匯後、所能供給外滙者、僅爲若干種指定之必需品、換言之、丹一切不爲平準會所列入供給外匯之物品、即無法獲得外滙、但如外國奢侈品等、在一般有錢人仍不吝重價購取、經營者雖明知正當外滙無法獲取、仍不願停止其經營、遂盡力在黑市扒取外滙頭寸、黑市中頭寸有限、而扒取者甚多、在供求不相協調之下、黑滙又安得不猛縮、上海不准申請外匯各業代表赴港請求平準會准予供給外滙後、現消息傳來、又被駁斥、此　亦必追求頭寸、實勢所必爾、</p>
<p>法幣價值毫無變動</p>
<p>某氏續稱、黑匯雖見縮、但對一般市民之日常生活、殊無所關、因平準會對必需品所需外匯、仍照常供給、滙率亦始終未有變動、故必需品之價格、當然不致有所變動、須知黑滙緊縮、影響者爲非需品、我儕普通市民、只須食飽衣暖、並無他求、彼非必需品之抬價、則聽之可耳、無所用其惶恐與憂慮、至於一般人認爲此黑匯緊縮、乃法幣貶值、殊不知法幣對外價值、觀於中央銀行法定匯率之毫無變動、可知穩定如初、彼黑市塲中、由於投機者興風作波、情形出乎正常、固絕不一足以測騐幣之價值、</p>
<p>國貨雖多需要有限</p>
<p>據商界談稱、現時上海生活接數日見增高、主要原因、實爲晶用品之被人囤積、據可靠方面估計、被囤積之日用品、如米·煤·棉紗·　粉·橡皮·五金·及其他商品、總值已超過九十萬萬元、其中米·煤·棉紗、約佔五分之一、若將此項囤積之商品、全部出售、則足敷上海一　長時期之消費、殆爲無可否認之事實、而商人大致爲不願影響資金、故緊握囤貨、不肯脫手、但囤積原料之結果、爲工廠减工、蓋原料價格　高於貨物之售價、使工廠又有何法可製造商品、例如釘價、今遠較鐵價爲賤是也、據最近估計、囤積之商品、計有棉紗二十七萬包、米十八萬噸、煤四十萬噸、依市價之總值、在三十一萬萬元以上、甚望兩租界當局、能及時深切注意、而予此輩奸人以制裁、</p>
<p>分派法滙殊可滿意</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市十四家友邦銀行、今日掛牌仍舊、據其中一銀行之某員告記者稱、該十四家銀行、皆不致有非法交易、依照目下辦法、平準會分派外匯、頗可滿意、且能　續多日、因平準會已有大量基金、可供支配也、投機者乘此機會活動、惟平準會已研究調整情况之各種辦法、不久將有所變更云、同時、日方軍用票價值、因受湘北戰報傳華軍獲勝之影響、今晨跌至二元五角、按上週六爲二元七角五分、</p>

<p>美日談判之失敗、使兩國關係復趨緊張、日本政府擬派輪船三隻、將留日各地美僑載送返國、并將美國日僑迎歸本國、此事昨在本埠人民羣中、引起迅速之反應因深恐有關國家之遠東僑民（包括上海在內）、將有廣泛之撤退也、唯據新聲社記者昨向各國有關當局探得確悉、美·英·荷蘭·瑞士等、曾經通令撤退遠東僑民之國家、對於遠東局勢之轉趨嚴重、認爲不足使各該國旣定之撤僑政策有所增减、因上海僑民撤退之舉、事實上可謂已告圓滿段落、此後僑民之往返、僅得視爲私人之行動、與整個國策無關、</p>

<p>最早撤退上海僑民者、爲美國、去年十月後、蒙德萊瑪立波薩及華盛頓之專輪之先後來滬載僑返國、繼之本埠美國商會、美僑協會及美國總會　同官方聯合組織一撤　委員會、推動非必要留居僑民之撤退計劃、迨今年年初、美總領署聲稱撤橋事已告圓滿結束、撤僑委會暫停工作、以後雖間有美僑撤退、但其數甚少、據記者昨向美領署方面探悉、上海美僑原在四千餘人之譜、經撤退後、目前僅勝八百五十名、其中男約六百人、女約二百五十人、此八百餘人、均與滬有商事等重要關係、非至絕對必要時、決不撤退、目前美國官方認爲撤橋問題、已成陳跡、今後僑民之離滬并不含有撤退之意義</p>
<p>在滬利益決不放棄</p>
<p>記者昨復以撤僑之事詢諸某美商、　稱、僑民撤退、往往易被人誤會爲「爲放棄僑民所在地之利益」、實則大謬不然、將美僑之撤退言之、所撤退者盡爲婦孺老弱、而不撤退者則爲有關整個美國權益維持之領導份子、或爲貿易中堅、或爲官方使節、或爲軍事人員、此兩者之決不撤退、即表示美國對於上海之租界、決無放棄之意、一般別有用心者、常佈　言、或謂美將撤退上海駐軍、又說美將放棄上海貿易、此言是虛是實、今可知之、渠繼稱「就余個人所知所信、目前遠東局勢、不影響美國在上海之地位、亦不致造成美國對滬政策之迅速轉變」、</p>
<p>留滬者均必要份子</p>
<p>他如英國僑民之撤退、雖前經當局通令、進行遠不及美僑之積極、在過去、上海英僑雖有若干離滬、但不含有撤退之意義、且其數絕少、故目前留滬之英僑、尚達四千五百人、其中男二千九百人、女一千六百人　位在日·猶·白俄·之下、佔第四位、昨日記者以英僑撤退事詢之關係當局、據稱「良以當局撤僑命令　並無強迫性、　如有　願撤退者、當局當予以協助而已」此外荷蘭瑞士兩國僑民之撤退、業已停頓、一則人數不多、二則僑民幾盡爲必要份子、所撤退者、祗爲婦孺、其外蘇聯·波蘭·德·義·捷克·丹麥·澳·希·挪·西·等國之僑民、均鎮靜如常、絕無不安之感覺、</p>

<p>最近本埠公共租界內錢莊銀號之開設、猶如雨後春筍、其中雖不乏資本雄厚、信譽卓著者、但跡近詐欺、內幕不堪設想者、亦非少數、本月八號、報上忽有天津路一九五弄集益里十號滙康錢莊開幕之廣告、聘請社會聞人聞蘭亭先生行揭幕禮、觀其表面、似爲規模宏大、資本雄厚之錢莊、不料開幕祗有一天、即告倒閉、實開銀錢業亘古未有之創聞、其內容之腐敗、殊不堪設想、現此案因其欺騙存戶頗多、經出首告發而爲中央捕房破獲、茲紀情形於次、</p>
<p>虛設字號</p>
<p>緣有寶山人陳曾煒、年祗二十五、對於銀錢事業、本屬外行、最近鑒於銀號錢莊之蓬勃、以其獲利較易、乃糾集　　人王一帆·紹興谷耀奎·徐展道·黃克夫等五人、集議股開滙康錢莊、額定資本十萬元、各認二萬元、於開辦時、先交股款十分之一、立有草契合同、乃　得天津路集益里十號房屋開始籌備、經　星　之裝修、即告開幕、舉陳曾煒爲經理、黃克夫爲協理、</p>
<p>詐欺取材</p>
<p>事先分向各親友處廣拉存戶、吸收存款（俗稱掛紅）　遂有　租界吉祥街大豐呢絨號主徐景星、及江西路一百十四號民孚報關行主吳民孚等、因碍於情面、允存款項、記徐五千元、吳二千五百元、均一次交付、至五號、徐因急需、乃開一支票、派人往滙康錢莊取存款二千元、不料該莊回稱無現款、先開具墾業銀行之支票、繼因自知支票不能兌現、從調給該莊十　號期本票一紙、屆　徐往該莊兌現、則所謂經協理早已潛逃、</p>
<p>捕獲四犯</p>
<p>莊中祗留不負責仟之茶役二人、知係遇騙、乃扭往總巡捕房報告、經華探目朱萬鈞探員王振菲擔任調查、先往滙康錢莊查抄、則內中竟無帳簿、繼得悉經理陳曾煒潛匿法租界愛多亞路大方飯店六〇二號房間、乃會同法捕房探員、按址將陳拘獲、抄出現鈔一千六百九十元、嗣又至南京路四三七號新安公司樓上、續獲王一帆谷耀奎徐展道三人、（徐因當時從樓窗躍下圖逃、致跌傷背部、現留醫院、協理黃克夫在逃未獲）、一倂滯入捕房收押、</p>
<p>欺騙大眾</p>
<p>昨晨解送特一院刑五庭、捕房律師錢恂九詳述以上情形、以被告等開設滑頭錢莊、被騙存戶頗多、非但欺騙大眾、抑且破壞銀錢業之信譽、捕房因不及詳細偵查、請求准予羈押、繼據吳民孚供明有存款二千五百元、存入滙康錢莊、執有存摺、翌日即本月九號、因有急需、故向該莊提回五百元、現被騙二千元、又據徐景星供、有存款五千元、於八號存入、至八號往提三千元無着、先給付墾業銀行支票後、又調一本票、至十一號往取、則已倒閉云云、</p>

<p>記者跳下人力車時面前有一蒼白得像死屍般的男子，因飲酒過度而嘔吐，頹然撲地，旁人毫不加以注意，幾秒鐘後，那人抬起頭來，爬行到門前，垂頭坐下。一個肥胖的外國女子，穿着夜服拖鞋，走來曳記者的袖子，操俄語搭訕，記者搖頭示意，一面推開人羣前行，但聞人聲嘈雜，俄語·德語·北歐語·英語·和華語，色色俱全，充滿空氣中。突然聽得一陣打噁聲，急忙閃避，祗見一個面貌醜陋的歐洲胖婦人，頭髮蓬亂，憑窗向外直吐，酒臭難聞。</p>
<p>一個瘦得像骷髏的俄人，輕撞記者，問道;「要女人嗎？」記者點頭，隨之走進發惡臭的暗衛，幾乎被兩個醉臥地上的水手絆倒。走進一間小室，裏面坐着六個衣衫單薄的女人，其中兩個是俄人或猶太人，餘皆華人，都像染有毒癮，記者取出一元，正擬說明前來見識，不料門戶大開，一女立刻將記者推進鄰室，室內半明不暗，一角床鋪上，坐着一個女子，正對紙片吸着，行近才見那女子用兩角的新紙幣，捲成管狀，吸着錫紙片上的白粉，還向記者一笑，問道：「你要吸嗎？」</p>
<p>記者依門隙向外窺望，祗見那青年醉臥椅上，幾個女子正在力施引誘，良久，那青年才操不純粹的英語道：「你能吸嗎？」幾秒鐘後，一個女子領他進鄰室去了。</p>
<p>記者退返暗衛中，見一旁火光閃閃，趨前觀之，原是兩個骨瘦如柴的俄童，年約十二歲和十五歲，燃火柴燻錫紙，一面狂吸紙上白粉。記者重回主衛，所見吸毒者，不計其數，猜想起來，約百分之七十五，都像染有毒癮。但嗜毒者和嗜酒者，一時難以區別，所以這估計也許不確。</p>
<p>記者又入另一暗衛，往來的人較少。一家妓院前坐着個祗穿短褲的女子，對着紙片吸紙烟，祗吸幾口，便將紙烟熄滅。記者問：「紙上有什麽可吸？」她答道：「吸粉呀！你到裏面去嗎？」記者點頭，正擬進屋，忽有一中國女子，奪門奔出，一個身材高大的外人隨後追出，搶上幾步，便將那女子抓住，橫衝直撞地推進屋去，門前那女子便道：「這女子吸白粉的時間太早，惹惱了他，他是俄人，這裏的老闆。你進去嗎？」</p>
<p>記者不顧和那俄人接觸，掉頭便走。橫衛一角，兩個華人乞丐，席地就鉛皮罐進食，對面臥着一個衣衫襤褸的金髮外人，吸食小紙包中的白粉。此情此景，真與人間地獄無異。（待續）</p>

<p>大陸報云、普善山莊職員陸君語記者、目下貧民生活、更形艱難、現時平均每日有二十人死亡、預料今冬死亡率、勢將劇增、故該莊現在努力準備多季之緊張工作、上述死亡率、尚限於該莊所收埋者、此外尚無從統計、若上海每一乞丐死亡、均有人報告該莊、則勢將無法收埋、</p>
<p>死亡人數日有增加</p>
<p>連日上海乞丐之死亡率、日有增加、該莊所接得報告電話、幾有日夜不息之勢、工部局若不及早設法、則冬季死亡者、必日見增加、以今夏　埠雨水甚多、使本市貧民甚感不便、此爲增加死亡率原因之一、蓋天花痢疾等流行病、傳佈甚速、貧民因無力醫治彼等兒童、故該莊往往接得電話、前往收埋時、頗多有尚未氣絕而不救者、設工部局能設兒童醫院、則此種不幸事件、或可減少、但此種最需要之醫院、上海並無、</p>
<p>掩埋屍體　兒童爲多</p>
<p>過去成人死亡率較少、最可異者、彼等所收埋之死丐、因餓而致死者少、大抵以吸毒發癮而死者爲多、在九月中、所收埋之屍體、有一千八百二十八具、其中成人祗六百四十二具、其餘均係兒童、成人屍體、多葬於虹橋區域、兒童屍體多葬於工部局墳地、在上二月份、或將增至百分之五百、亦不可知、</p>
<p>希望各界　源源捐輸</p>
<p>收埋成人之棺木、在戰前每具需八元至十元、現已增至五十元、費用雖激增、但又不能不繼續進行此種工作、該莊爲公共事業團體、爲公眾服務、故甚望捐款者、能源源輸將、使彼等有充份基金、得繼續工作、</p>
<p>應設醫院　專負其責</p>
<p>去年收屍總數、爲　萬九千四百四十具、其中有二萬零七百二十具爲兒屍、中國乞丐對兒童往往於未氣絕時、即棄置不顧、大致爲彼等父母一般心理、此輩童丐、既無食無住、終日遊蕩、以致死亡、惟一辦法、爲有醫院收容、在戰前一九三七年、該莊在閘北增設有此種醫院、收容成人及兒童、現已被燬、無款重建、在普善山莊之目的、不特在收埋屍體、且在可能範圍內、欲減少死亡率、此種辦法、蓋可減少掩埋費用也、現時工作範圍甚小、故該莊祗能稱爲服務團體、並不能爲公眾謀福利、此確爲事實、</p>

<p>— 凱蒂</p>
<p>——我得了一個教訓</p>
<p>下面並不是一樁帶有快感的經騐。</p>
<p>一年前我還在某廠樣子間供職。該廠經理具有新腦筋，他特別注重這商戰的第一條防綫—　樣子間。因此我十分小心地工作，想把工作做得圓滿，無可指摘。一個有前途的靑年當造成及保持工作方面的信譽。我存着這樣的心理天天工作着。</p>
<p>某日樣子問來了三個男子，穿着漂亮的西裝，說是剛從港來滬，想採辦些貨物。我先很疑惑，因爲他們不像做買賣的人。我立即回說我們在港已有某行代理。他們就問是不是在某街某厦的某行嗎？我聽他們說得頭頭是道，也就不再疑慮。他們要入內參觀，我也允許；並且聚精會神地招待這些「華貴的顧客。」</p>
<p>事後回家忽然覺得這三個不速之客有些離奇。如果他們偷去了一些東西，那麼我多少時日盡心想保持的信譽不將完全掃地嗎？經理不將因我不守職而不加信任了嗎？我憂慮愁悶，晚上也沒有好睡。</p>
<p>第二天起了一個早，去檢點貨品，却沒有少什麼，存貨賬上也沒有錯誤。這纔放心；暗笑自己神經過敏，自尋煩惱</p>
<p>數月後的一天，忽然有兩個捕房探目挾着一個鎯鐺的竊犯闖人樣子即來，劈頭就向我認識這人否？認識？怎麽不？矮矮的個子，黑黑的臉龐，三個不速之客中的一個　但是我好像在做夢，也好像由夢裏驚醒過來。事情太奇怪太突然了。眞像晴天一聲霹靂，把我保持着的坦然的態度打得焦頭爛額。我猶如失了重心，心砰砰的跳動，呆呆地發怔，半響開不出口來。</p>
<p>原來這人數月前確從我們那裏偷了一些東西去。但偷的是一位猶太買客寄在我們那裹的東西。怪不得我在賬簿上存貨上都檢點不出有短缺。</p>
<p>因爲偷去的不是我們的東西，却使我內心起了掙扎。在我面前有兩條路；一條是據實報吿經理，是直路。另一條山我自已去解決，是灣路。當時我的第二條能保全我的信譽，似乎是很聰明的一條。我就挑了它。</p>
<p>從那天起，我開始使用「自我庇護」和「逃避」機構，不去應付現實——逃避及遮蓋。費了許多心力去度一個小坦白的生活。兩三個月後，事情纔吿結束，失物　歸了原中，法庭也宜了判：我以爲一切都已千穩萬妥地得了解決，我所要保全的也已保全了。</p>
<p>誰知道又是兩月後的一天，中央捕房給我來了一個電話，爲了竊犯中的一個是入外國籍的，當由領事裁判，請我去作證。因了這個電話，事情就像淤泥中發現了白沙一般，因了人們的好奇而給揭露出來。更壞的是第二天捕房深恐我拒絕作證而直接求見經理，幾月來我想像中最糟的一幕，最不願見的一幕，終於給他們大刀闊斧地搬演上臺了，把我所要保全的自我粉碎無遺。</p>
<p>但是事情過後不多時，我就覺得這是一個極寳貴的敎訓及經騐。我記得基督敎聖經中有着這句話：「掩蓋的事，沒有不露出來的。隱藏的事，沒有不被人知道的。」現在這話成了我的生命的一分子了。人類最易不肯應付現實，祇要保持現狀及自我。所以不肯坦白公開而想隱瞞掩飾，結果造成許多不需要的行爲機構，養成抝曲的心理，失去自由快樂的心地，浪費積極前進的力量。對個人，家庭，國家，社會都是一種莫大的損失。然而結果呢？往往是逃不了現實，那麽爲什麽不走那一條直截了當的直路呢？自此以後，我每件事都取坦白不自諱自欺的態度；若是有錯即刻承認，這樣我反能保持我的信譽，能得經理的信任。雖然有時還受着不要走直路的引誘，但是我一想到這决的經騐，就鼓着勇氣踏上那坦直的路——坦直的路是最短最易達到目的的路。</p>

<h3 id="c68">別惹孩子的氣 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>孩子，這個小東西！眞不知道需要多沙的精力去應付他！</p>
<p>我眞以爲在孩子身上所化去的一切，可以使我成就一件很偉大的事業了。但是，直到今天，「孩子的功課」我還沒有念到一牛哩！</p>
<p>孩子，他那小小「心理」的演出，會使你想像不來：你有意要他在友人面前顯得活潑一點，他偏是獃的像木鷄一般；上好的橘子水不喝，定要買着糖葫蘆吃；爬高凳跌下來了，還是要繼續爬上去；常會和生着疥瘡的小四子，纏在一起………</p>
<p>於是，我氣！我很想學一點「母敎」，把孩子狠狠地打了一頓！</p>
<p>可是，我那握緊了的「老拳」，總造情不自禁地放鬆了，不願碰着我那孩子多嫩的肌膚。因爲我已經領會了：</p>
<p>『怒氣超乎理智，並不是愛的表現。』</p>
<p>我愛我的孩子，我打他，也不能背乎「愛」的原則，所以我得濾淸「怒」的每一滴。</p>
<p>我分析孩子鬧別扭的原因，有多少是自己惹出來的？自己點着的火，再自己去撲滅它，許多人慣會在孩子身上做這笨事。</p>
<p>留心你的孩子，他會有許多超特的「建議」的。你別把自已認作百分之百的「不錯」，而把他的全都推翻了。且瞧這小小思想之苗，他日要成作一顆滿了果子的樹，叫你驚服！</p>
<p>孩子總比你强的，像你以爲比你的媽强一樣。</p>
<p>所以，孩子不是玩物，孩子也小是「出氣筒」，聰明的母親，她會懂得怎樣用多方面的摯愛去養育她的孩子們！</p>
<p>聖經中有一句話是送給每一個做父母的：</p>
<p>『不要惹兒女的氣！』</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十三　流浪到上海</p>
<p>直到快要歇息之前，秋海棠才想到有一件切身問題，似乎應該湊這個機會，請問請問盧排長。</p>
<p>「你瞧這兒可能再待下去嗎？排長。」他用很低的聲音，一字一頓的問。</p>
<p>「這是很難說的，假使他們的鐵騎一到，那末別說不能待下去，也許你們田裏的東西也要種不成了！」這是盧排長和另外兩個士兵的共同的見解。</p>
<p>「那怎麽辦呢？」梅寳也不由皺起眉毛來了。</p>
<p>「祇能湊早上南邊去啊！」又一個年輕的兵士說：「假使咱們的老百姓都能在他們米到之前走一個空，那末他們徒然奪到許多城池，也是不會有什麼好處的！」</p>
<p>不待他說完，梅寳已望着她父親連連點頭了。</p>
<p>「不錯，咱們都應該走啊！」她的意思彷彿這樣說。</p>
<p>可是說話很容易，眞要走却就困難了。雖然接連好幾大他們都聽到許多很可怕的消息，而且還眼見許多退下來的軍隊和難民，成羣結隊的在街上走過；甚至村裏也有好幾家已實行遷居了，但秋海棠的心理，却還想勉强苟延下去。梅寳催問了他幾决，他總是說：</p>
<p>「孩子，別性急，眞到不能再待的時候，我還怕不想走嗎？實在因爲咱們是莊稼人，離開了田地就小能生活，所以還想多挨一天好一天。一（二三五）</p>

<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>程硯秋成名經過（上）</p>
<p>程硯秋此次南來應黃金之聘，於十月一日出演，每日客滿，並不因受價高些許影響，其魔力可謂大矣。今述其成名經過，以餉讀者。可見凡百藝事，欲登峯造極，受世人崇拜，皆由辛苦得來，非倖致也。硯秋初名艷秋，字玉霜，原本淸室貴胄，民國後，家中落，乃習伶，初拜刀馬旦榮蝶仙爲師，民國八年秋，彼初登臺露演於東安市塲丹桂茶園，戲爲三娘敎子，彼在童年，叉朝夕勤於習劇，面部瘦削，身材細長，秀氣溢於眉目，非今日吾人所見之一百八十餘磅之稈硯秋也。硯秋之成名，得力於羅癭公之介，師事梅蘭芳，此爲硯秋之大轉機。硯秋於民國十年代表其師梅氏，赴南通更俗劇塲唱宇宙鋒一據而紅，遂受張季直先生及南方人士之賞識。不久即應上海某舞臺之聘，乃於梅派之外，別開程腔門戶，基礎旣立，膨漲至今。夫硯秋本非梨園世家，孤寒無依，曩使無聲名赫赫之師友，爲之輔翼，能有今日地位與吾，未可定也。</p>
<p>硯秋嗓音淸剛苦澀，獨長哀情戲，與蘭芳之嫵媚甜潤，適成反比，恰如其名，蓋春蘭秋霜，禀賦於天之靈氣，大相逕庭故也。然不同之中，又有相同者在：一，謙恭有禮，虛心受敎；二，勤苦習藝，不怠所業；三，起居有節，潔身自勵：上述三德，蘭芳有之，硯秋亦有之，試觀他伶，蓋難全也。</p>

<p>Advancing Along Yichang Front to Encircle Yueyang and Linxiang; Wuhan's Japanese Troops Are Weak and Desperately Telegraph Tokyo for Assistance</p>
<p>Changsha—General Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of Hunan Province, stated while receiving Chinese and foreign journalists who came here for inquiries that the army has now begun a general counteroffensive, advancing along the Yichang front towards Shashi and encircling Yueyang and Linxiang in the northern front. General Xue also announced that the Chinese army had entered Yichang city and urged all democratic countries to take joint action to restrain Japan and Germany. He believed that Japan would eventually invade the Soviet Union, and the Japanese Third, Fourth, and Sixth Divisions would soon be transferred to the Northeast to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, as these three divisions were known for their skill in mountain warfare. It is estimated that the Japanese army gathered on the border of the Northeast totals thirty-one divisions. General Xia Hua, who commands the three Chinese divisions defending Changsha, detailed the battle situation in Changsha, saying that two divisions were holding Changsha, and one division was stationed on the west bank of the Xiang River. Part of the Japanese 13th Division and the cavalry of the 6th Division advanced from the east on September 27 and reached Changsha, while another part of the Japanese 4th Division sneaked in from the north. At dawn on the 29th, some Japanese troops crossed the Liuyang River and reached the northeast gate of Changsha, but at dawn on the 30th, the Chinese army counterattacked and repelled the Japanese army to the positions of the Liuyang River and the Lao Dao River. It is estimated that a total of three thousand Japanese soldiers sneaked into Changsha. The Japanese side used paratroopers three times in the Battle of Changsha. They wore Chinese clothes, carried rifles and submachine guns, and landed two miles from the city. While the Japanese army advanced, they also built roads, but the US army counterattacked on their flanks and rear, so that the Japanese army's food could not be transported to the front line. At the same time, the Chinese reinforcements were quickly transferred to the battlefield. One Cantonese army firmly defended the northern front of Changsha, while another army shattered the Japanese army's attempt to land on the southeastern bank of Dongting Lake. A Sichuan army unit was stationed behind the Japanese army south of the Miluo River and also showed great skill in this battle. The Japanese army mostly used cavalry attacks and could not use tanks and heavy artillery because the roads were destroyed by the Chinese side. The Japanese cavalry suffered heavy losses when attacking defensible mountains held by the Chinese army, and many also died in ambush attacks in narrow roads at night. According to soldiers who participated in the Lao Dao River battle, the Japanese army hardly used artillery in the final stage of this battle because the Chinese army intercepted the Japanese transport team, and all 120 trucks of artillery shells prepared to be transported to the front line were destroyed. Japanese aircraft did not appear in large numbers in this Changsha battle. The reason is still unknown. Two years ago, the Japanese army used forty or fifty aircraft at any point to cover the Japanese army's advance, but this year there were only five or six aircraft at each point, and the most was only eight. The morale of the Chinese side is very good, and the military and civilians have complete trust in General Xue Yue's ability to defend Changsha. Now residents are returning to their hometowns in northern Hunan, such as Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan, by water and land routes. General Xue is arranging free transportation for the returning refugees, who were very orderly during the retreat, leaving the city to the southeast and southwest instead of following the roads and railways to avoid hindering the transportation of reinforcements coming from the south. Foreign journalists inspected the war zone and the place where the Japanese army crossed the Liuyang River, and also inspected the line along which the Japanese army advanced, and also visited the mountains by which the Chinese army drove out the Japanese army from Changsha. General Xue praised Chairman Chiang Kai-shek endlessly, saying that during the critical time of the Battle of Changsha, Chairman Chiang often personally made phone calls at 3:00 AM to instruct on combat strategies.

<p>The Battle of Changsha and the Counteroffensive in Yichang are Proof: Wang Shijie Gives a Speech to Foreign Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>Chongqing: Minister Wang of the Central Propaganda Department made the following speech at a reception for foreign reporters on the 13th. The news of the battles in Changsha and Yichang is very encouraging. Some people may ask why the highest military authorities in China are not satisfied with defeating the Japanese in Changsha, but continue to counterattack the Japanese base in Yichang. The equipment of the Chinese army is still not as good as that of the Japanese. The Japanese will use all means and cruel combat methods when they are at the end of their rope. We are well aware of all of this. Since this is the case, why doesn't the Chinese army take a temporary rest after defeating the Japanese in Changsha and continue to counterattack Yichang? The answer to this question is that the Chinese government and the highest military authorities want to use our more active military actions to cooperate with the democratic countries' recent increased assistance to China and their increasingly tightened economic blockade against Japan. Here, everyone may recall that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek told reporters from the Associated Press on September 10 that the exhaustion of Japan's strength and the decline of its arrogance are due to China's resolute warfare and the recent US-led economic sanctions against Japan. Chairman Chiang is convinced that in China's continued bloody warfare, the economic sanctions of the United States and other democratic countries against Japan will only intensify and will not be relaxed. At the same time, Chairman Chiang has clearly stated that unless a permanent, just, and well-guaranteed peace is achieved, China will continue to fight against Japan and will never be afraid of any sacrifice. The Battle of Changsha and the counteroffensive in Yichang provide a solid proof of Chairman Chiang's above remarks. We firmly believe that the Chinese fighting spirit demonstrated in this decisive battle is more worthy of everyone's attention than the battle results achieved by our army. After completing the necessary investigation work in a short time, the two delegations of Magruder and Ni Mia will quickly carry out their planned work and quickly put their plans into practice, because these delegations are wartime messengers and are different from peacetime inspection groups. In fact, the two delegations had already begun working before arriving in Chongqing. General Magruder was very busy in Manila, and Sir Ni Mia was very busy in Hong Kong. Finally, Minister Wang solemnly pointed out to the reporters, based on the accurate reports received by the military authorities, the matter of the Japanese army using gas in Yichang and urged them to pay attention.

<h3 id="e10">Price Changes and Reassessment of Theories <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The change in prices is like moving a hair, which can affect the whole body. It has an inescapable impact on life and is deeply related to the national economy and people's livelihood. It is indeed the focus of today's world economic system. Therefore, all countries are committed to controlling prices in order to achieve a stable level and serve as a measure of people's lives.</p>
<p>The soaring prices in our country over the past year have truly set an unprecedented record in the world. Apart from not following the collapse of the Russian ruble and the German mark during the First World War and having its own special reasons, if compared with the prices of warring or non-warring countries today, the difference is like heaven and earth! We have previously written articles elaborating on the reasons for price changes and providing insights on curbing prices, hoping to speak out for the people. Now there are more and more people discussing this issue, and famous sayings and sincere advice are dazzling. The government has also taken some steps to relieve people's difficulties, and it is expected that there will be more progressive facilities to seek the welfare of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Now, a brief comparison of prices in Chongqing and Chengdu will be made to illustrate the characteristics of the changes, in order to prove that our previous statement is not wrong. First, looking at the retail price index of the working class in Chongqing published by the Ministry of Finance, with the first half of 1937 as the base year, the obtained index is as follows: February 1938—104.2; February 1939—174.7; February 1940—305.4; July of the same year—449.8; September of the same year—695.0; October of the same year—744.9; November of the same year—1,007.6; December of the same year—1,227.6; January 1941—1,147.9; February of the same year—1,247.1. Then looking at the cost of living index of the working class in Chengdu, with February to June 1937 as the base year, the obtained total index is as follows: Average of 1938—95.4; Average of 1939—124.7; February 1940—209.1; September of the same year—488.5; October of the same year—715.3; November of the same year—806.1; December of the same year—785.6; January 1941—894.8; February of the same year—987.0. From the above two indexes, the trend of rising began in 1940. If the grain item in Chengdu is compiled, the base year period is the same as before, and the obtained indexes are 90.4; 112.6; 196.4; 439.5; 766.6; 827.0; 833.3; 969.7; 1,063.6—the trend of soaring is even more significant. If we talk about the price of rice in Chongqing in February 1941, it has soared twenty times compared to before the war, and it has also risen seventeen times compared to February 1939.</p>
<p>Based on the above indexes and the prices in other rear areas, the reason for the soaring prices cannot be measured by common sense. The military, political, and economic environment during this period were extremely stable. Several points are explained below. Taking currency issuance as an example, the Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of issuance at the beginning of 1941 only increased by five to five and a half times compared to July 1937, while the retail prices in Chongqing soared eleven times during the same period, indicating that the price increase is the cause and the increase in currency issuance is the result. Assuming that the high exchange rate is the main reason for the soaring prices in our country, then the prices in Hong Kong can be used for comparison and identification. When one Hong Kong dollar could be exchanged for national currency in January 1941, it could purchase twice as much lard, three times as much rice, and four and a half times as much salt in Hong Kong as in Chongqing. From this, it can be seen that the purchasing power of legal currency abroad is stronger than at home, which is also a characteristic that no other country's currency has. Some say that the increase in transportation costs is the reason for the increase in prices, which is even less credible, because most commodity transportation relies entirely on coolies and cattle and horses, and the increase in freight rates in Sichuan is only about 150%. Even with automobile transportation, the increase is only about 240%, while the retail prices in Chongqing have increased by 450%. Therefore, transportation costs are by no means a factor in the price increase. Some say that industrial manufactured goods are an element of rising grain prices, which is undoubtedly a misconception of reality. From the index, since March 1940, important manufactured goods such as clothing have been declining, because people's purchasing power has been completely absorbed by food, and there is no spare capacity to purchase manufactured goods.</p>
<p>In summary, the soaring prices in the Great Rear Area have no other reason that can justify themselves except for manipulation and monopoly. However, unlike Shanghai, the cost of goods in the Great Rear Area is higher than in Shanghai, and losses due to air raids and transportation, as well as high management fees, are all factors that increase prices and can be understood by the people. However, most of the soaring prices are still speculative manipulation, which is no different from Shanghai. The government has already understood the truth and has repeatedly ordered to crack down on it. We sincerely hope that it will be implemented vigorously in order to achieve the actual effect of control and benefit the people's livelihood, which is what we sincerely pray for.</p>

<p>United Press, Tokyo, 13th. The U.S. Embassy yesterday announced that American citizens wishing to evacuate from Japan on three ships departing in the middle of this month should register with the Embassy as soon as possible. The Japanese government has not indicated whether it will assist the evacuation of American citizens, as the departure date of the ships is only three days away.

Secretary of State Hull will explain the reasons for repealing Article 6 of the Neutrality Act (the clause prohibiting armed American merchant ships). Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox, Chief of Staff Admiral Stark, and Chairman of the Maritime Commission Major General Land will also speak successively, explaining their views. Government-aligned members of Congress hope that the House of Representatives will submit the amendment to a vote on the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 13th. Senators Hill and Brooks engaged in a heated debate last night on the radio regarding the amendment of the Neutrality Act. Their debate can be said to be the prelude to today's grand debate on this matter in the House of Representatives. Hill stated, "The American Neutrality Act is a dream of the past; arming American merchant ships is a necessity." Brooks warned the audience that arming American merchant ships "will inevitably lead to bloodshed."</p>

<p>British Air Force Captain Also Dies in Accident, Cause of Incident Under Investigation</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 13th. A Lockheed aircraft carrying important passengers crashed in the air shortly after taking off from the new airport here this afternoon, landing nearby and being completely destroyed by fire. It is rumored that several senior military officers bound for Bandoeng were on board, but the passenger list is still under investigation.</p>
<p>United Press, Batavia, 13th. Lieutenant General Berenschot, Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies Army, died today in a plane crash, only five minutes after the plane took off. He had previously met with Sir Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command, who was en route to Australia. After the plane crash, Major General Boerstra, Chief of Staff of the Dutch East Indies Army, who had just arrived in Manila, was immediately recalled. All five people on board the plane were killed, and eleven natives also died when the burning plane struck their homes. Captain Knapp of the Dutch East Indies Army, the pilot of the plane, and two non-commissioned officers were among those who died. The cause of the accident has not yet been determined, but an investigation has been ordered.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Timoshenko's Central Route Troops Retreat from Bryansk <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Transfer to a New Defensive Line Protecting Moscow</p>
<p>Vyazma Tank Brigade Frustrates the German Army's Momentum</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th. According to sources here, General Timoshenko's troops were forced to retreat from Bryansk today. After fierce fighting to the southwest of the city, they have transferred to a new defensive line protecting Moscow. The successful retreat of Timoshenko's troops may have foiled the German army's attempt to encircle and destroy the Soviet forces in the area. The new defensive line they have transferred to is reportedly very strong, as it had been prepared for a long time in advance. The fighting in the Vyazma area, 130 miles from Moscow, is also becoming increasingly fierce, as the German army continues to commit all its troops, artillery, and tanks to the battle, in order to confront the rapidly reinforcing Soviet reserves. This decisive offensive is the western bend of the German army's pincer movement on Moscow, and it is reported that the other bend has penetrated several points north of Orel (200 miles south of Moscow). The Soviet side claims to have contained the German army in the Orel area. The German side now seems to be committing all its manpower to the central route offensive. There are signs that Soviet troops are taking the initiative in some locations. The situation at the approaches to Leningrad is reportedly quite complex. The German army has adopted a defensive posture, building deep trenches and strong fortifications in some strongholds, but Soviet artillery is gradually driving them out. The activities of Soviet guerrillas behind German lines are also quite successful.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th. Moscow Radio's midnight communique acknowledged that Soviet troops had withdrawn from Bryansk (a railway junction 230 miles southwest of Moscow). The communique also stated that there was fierce fighting along the entire front, with Bryansk and Vyazma being particularly intense.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th. A Reuters military correspondent said that the war on the Eastern Front has entered its seventeenth week, and the fighting is becoming more intense than before. The German army's fierce offensive, which has now lasted 112 days, seems to have exhausted its greatest strength. Hitler has said that this is "the last major offensive before winter." Although the Soviet front line has repeatedly shifted backward, it has not yet been broken. Both sides have suffered extremely heavy losses. Now that the Soviet army is fighting with Moscow at its back, its fighting spirit and morale are as high as at the beginning of the war. In at most two more weeks, the weather will turn severely cold, and the German army will lack sufficient protection and food. This is a major reason why Hitler wants to occupy Moscow for the winter. In the past 24 hours, there has been no noteworthy development in the war. Recent Soviet communiques still emphasize the German army's attacks on Vyazma and Bryansk, and the Soviet army's resolute resistance. The situation in Orel is still unclear. Undoubtedly, this is a key area on the main road to Moscow. As for the southern front, the German side claims to have cleared out the Soviet troops whose retreat was cut off between Melitopol and Perekop. The number of Soviet troops claimed to have been captured by the German side seems to be exaggerated, and may include captured civilians. In the far north, the Soviet army seems to have an offensive posture, clearly determined to keep the Murmansk route open, as this route is the shortest and fastest supply line for the Allied powers. The activity of the British Air Force alongside Soviet aircraft in that area is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Soviet People's Anti-Paratrooper Organization is Extremely Strict, Germans Find it Difficult to Succeed</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 13th. It is reported that the German army is committing more paratroopers to the battle in the hope of dividing and harassing the Red Army's rear. Since the Battle of Crete, the German paratrooper units have been reorganized and are now being used in the Soviet Union. According to Soviet reports, the paratroopers who land carry submachine guns, hand grenades, wireless radios, and grappling hooks. The grappling hooks are used to help paratroopers descend from rooftops and trees. The Soviets have established a sophisticated system of defensive stations behind the front line to deal with attacking paratroopers. This system uses the assistance of farmers and town residents, who have repeatedly been warned to pay attention to paratroopers at all times and have been trained to help eliminate them. It is also stated that the Red Army Marines have dealt the German army a serious blow on the Leningrad front. The Red Army Marines landed near Leningrad and carried out large-scale operations, threatening the German army in a nearby city. It is reported that the Red Army Marines have already stormed into the city and attacked German fortresses. The German army retreated, suffering losses in personnel and equipment. The fighting is still continuing. The Red Army fleet from the Odessa area reported that Romanian troops attacking the area have been repelled. The Soviet army counterattacked, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Soviet artillery destroyed three battalions of enemy infantry. On Friday, 17 German aircraft were destroyed and 14 Soviet aircraft were lost. On Saturday and Sunday, German aircraft were shot down, 12 of which were destroyed yesterday.</p>
<p>German Army Launches Second Fierce Offensive North of Orel</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Moscow, 12th. The Communist Party's official newspaper, *Pravda*, published an editorial today discussing the situation on the front lines. It stated, "The German-Soviet war will be protracted and extremely difficult, and we hope that the people will report it." It also stated that snow has already fallen in the Orel area, and the nights and early mornings are extremely cold. The German army first launched an offensive to occupy the city of Orel, and German mechanized units launched a second offensive north of the city, attempting to break through the Red Army's defensive line. Fortunately, the Red Army resolutely resisted and finally contained them. The German army used heavy artillery to bombard the area fiercely, and also used hundreds of dive bombers to assist in the battle, bombing the Red Army's positions up to nine times in one day in an attempt to leave the Red Army with no room to maneuver. However, the Red Army's tanks and field artillery were disguised, so there were no losses. The Red Army's morale is high and they are not deterred by prolonged fighting. Later, the German army used tanks to attack the Red Army's positions from the flanks, but was also repelled. Soviet aircraft were also very active on the front lines, constantly bombing German supply trains and ammunition depots, making a great contribution to the overall situation. In short, the situation in the Orel area is still extremely serious. The Red Army's main task is to contain the German army so that it cannot advance north.</p>
<p>One Million British Troops Concentrated on Indian Border, Preparing to Cross Border to Aid Soviet Union</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Simla, 13th. A million Indian troops (the monthly reserve army has increased to 50,000) are reliably reported to have completed preparations today, and will immediately enter the Soviet Union if the German army invades and threatens the Caucasus oil region. It is believed that if the German army attacks the southern or eastern flank of the Soviet Union, or takes action against Turkey, Britain will take countermeasures. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, and General Auchinleck's Middle East Force are expected to take joint action if the German army ventures to invade. It is understood that General Wavell's headquarters here has 100,000 Indian troops stationed along the border and outside India, while the 800-mile-long northwest border of India, the Middle East, and Malaya are filled with troops and military equipment for defensive purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Beaverbrook Broadcasts: Britain is Determined Not to Let Down Allies <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Will Provide as Much Supply as Possible to the Soviet Union, U.S. Representative Also Makes Same Assurance</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th. Minister of Supply Beaverbrook broadcast to the world last night, describing the results of the British and American mission to Moscow, stating that Britain and the United States are now giving the Soviet Union as much supply as possible, and that the tanks and aircraft requested by Stalin for supply in October have already been supplied by Britain and the United States. The Soviet side has manufactured two very excellent aircraft, and their pilots are excellent. The Soviet army is currently in a serious crisis, their pain is heartbreaking, and it will last for a long time, but their morale has never been discouraged, and their determination is unstoppable. Britain will not let down its allies, and will give Stalin support, and make sure the Soviet army receives full supply of all armaments to engage in the spring battles. The United States fully trusts all our actions, and our gratitude for Mr. Harriman and his team cannot be expressed in words. He also described the six committees working all day, and his and Harriman's evening visit to the Kremlin to discuss matters with Stalin and Molotov. It is said that in order to accelerate the progress of the talks, replies to Stalin's questions, which had been anticipated, were drafted in Russian in advance, so that the replies could be handed to Stalin without having to wait for the interpreter to speak. Our conclusion is that Britain and the United States will share the heavy burden, and supply as much as possible to the Soviet Union to meet their needs. In terms of tanks and aircraft, Stalin's request is exactly the number we have already promised. For fear that the outside world does not understand, it is hereby stated that the supply we promised in October has been fully supplied. We should also supply some artillery and a large number of good cannons and ammunition, and promise to supply aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, tin, cobalt, phosphorus, rubber, jute, wool, diamonds, and other bulk raw materials needed by the Soviet Union. Harriman and I have assured that the British and American workers will work hard to produce, so we must now demonstrate this with facts. Stalin trusts our guarantees, and believes that we will be able to fulfill our promises, and I think so too. The Soviet side is also able to manufacture armaments themselves, and the efficiency of their aircraft and engine factories has reached the working standards of the United States. The Soviet MiG-3 fighter can rival the German Messerschmitt, and the Soviet Petlyakov Pe-2 dive bomber is "an outstanding achievement." The Soviet side should be able to make the most of their self-made weapons. He also described the situation when he discussed the items needed by the Soviet Union during the final meeting with Stalin, saying that after I and Harriman expressed our agreement with the list of items, Litvinov jumped up and shouted happily, and Stalin also looked relieved, quite pleased and trusting. Regarding the Soviet Union's own production capacity, I have good news to report. The aircraft manufactured by the Soviet side can be compared with American aircraft and British Spitfires and Hurricanes, but the German air force is also strong, and when the German side began attacking the Soviet Union, it dispatched 30,000 tanks, and now it is using 14,000 tanks to attack Moscow. We must aim for 30,000 tanks, so that one day we can change from defense to offense. The Soviet authorities know that the British people will persevere to the end, until victory is achieved. I believe that the Soviet Union also has the same determination.</p>

<p>Reuters, Moscow, 13th. TASS News Agency, Geneva, stated that only one-quarter of the German troops formerly stationed in Belgium are still in Belgium, and the rest were transferred to the Eastern Front a month ago. The batch of German troops was suddenly transferred east at night, maintaining strict secrecy, so that the people would not know about it. Residents of the Belgian city of Liège have been ordered not to leave their homes from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM for several days. After the reduction of the German garrison in Belgium, the occupying authorities intensified their acts of terror. Martial law has been declared in several coastal towns in Belgium, but anti-German elements are still taking advantage of the reduced German garrison to carry out major activities. Three German soldiers and one German officer were assassinated in Brussels recently.</p>

<p>Communists Strongly Advocate Launching an Offensive in Europe to Coordinate with the Soviet Union to Eliminate Nazism</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th. This week, British discussions and newspaper editorials are all seriously considering the war situation, paying attention to the Soviet Union's position. The intensification of tactical debates shows how deeply British emotions are stirred by the Soviet war. Although the general public agrees on the eventual outcome, there is much discussion on what is the best way to achieve this outcome. There are those with extreme views, such as the British Communist Party, who strongly advocate that Britain should currently launch an offensive in Western Europe. The party published an article yesterday, stating that the honor of the British people is currently in danger, and if we allow the Soviet Union to fail, then history will demand terrible condemnation. Now is the time to open a second front in the West. This view is supported by many newspaper commentators, such as Gordon, editor of the *Sunday Dispatch* run by Beaverbrook. Gordon accused the British War Office of not having the ability to pre-empt, and said that watching Hitler destroy the Allied powers one by one will not preserve the British Empire. Although this proposition is supported by many people, it is not universal. The *Observer* editor Garvin said that Britain does not have enough shipping, nor complete air superiority, and that it would be a grave mistake to call on Britain to risk an inadequately equipped army on a distant expedition into Hitler's Europe. Beaverbrook's remarks last night should make the people more aware of the whole issue. Cabinet member Greenwood spoke in Blackburn yesterday, responding to those who advocated that more aid should be given to the Soviet Union, saying that he also held this view. Britain will definitely provide the Soviet Union with aid to the extent of its material and human resources, without harming itself. If the Soviet Union's industrial capacity is destroyed, then Britain and the United States must provide all possible aid for the sake of honor and defending common ideals. This effort will continue until the Allied powers' production overwhelms the enemy.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 13th. General Sikorski, head of the Polish government in exile in London, said that a British attack on the European continent next spring could save the Soviet Union and defeat Hitler.</p>

The Communist Party's official newspaper, *The Daily Worker*, also called on the American people to fight against Germany alongside Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 13th: An Italian convoy attempting to cross the central Mediterranean was fiercely attacked for seven hours on Friday night and early Saturday morning by British naval torpedo planes and Royal Air Force bombers, suffering extremely heavy losses. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence, among the enemy convoy's medium and large merchant ships, three were hit by torpedoes within twenty minutes. The five escorting destroyers scattered and fled, and the convoy disintegrated. Two of the torpedoed enemy ships and one destroyer were left behind. One of the two ships caught fire, and the other gradually sank. Soon after, British bombers descended through the clouds, dropping large bombs at low altitude and strafing. Early Saturday morning, British naval aircraft followed the enemy destroyer gunfire, flew to the attack, and torpedoed three ships within twenty minutes. As the naval aircraft flew back, British bombers broke through the air and launched another fierce bombing and strafing attack, inflicting heavy damage on enemy ships.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: On Sunday evening, over three hundred British bombers raided German territory, the main target being Nuremberg. The weather was clear that night, and the bombing was extremely fierce. The weather in the western and southwestern suburbs of Germany was unfavorable, but a large number of British aircraft still carried out fierce bombing. Bremen was the most heavily bombed. Eleven British planes were missing.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: Among the British aircraft that set off to bomb German territory on Sunday evening were the largest British four-engine Stirling bombers, making it the largest night raid since the war began.

<p>Yesterday's black market situation was chaotic and surprisingly bullish, unprecedented. It has broken through the 11,000 yuan mark. Confidence is high across the board due to another dramatic tightening of foreign exchange. The U.S. dollar is only at 3.5 yuan with demand exceeding supply. Although the Ho Tai Bank reappeared, it still absorbed over 300 taels. Another bank took in over 500 taels. There is a severe shortage of circulating capital, and the market price has risen irreversibly. On the same day, it soared from 10,450 yuan to 11,300 yuan, a new high never before seen in the price of gold, a massive increase of 1,140 yuan. 1,600-1,700 taels were traded. Although the new standard Shanghai exchange market price for October gold is still unknown, it also rose from 7,970 yuan to a high of 8,320 yuan due to buying by Hong Kong firms and securities exchange bill brokers. It ended the day up 320 yuan, with 1,400-1,500 taels traded. Ornament gold also rose 120 yuan, reaching 1,150 yuan, also a price never before seen in gold prices.</p>
<p>Cash Sets New Record High</p>
<p>The bullish trend in cash has expanded again, with unprecedented highs emerging one after another. From the opening of the market in the morning at 10,100-10,200 yuan, it was gradually bid up to 10,500 yuan, when Xiang He first sold 10 taels to Xin Yuan, 440 yuan higher than last week's noon closing. Yong Cheng, Wan Feng, and Yi Feng sold, and there was a small pullback to 10,450 yuan. Unexpectedly, Ho Tai Bank suddenly absorbed a huge amount, and a money shop took in 500 taels on behalf of a certain bank. Xiang He also took in, and the price soared to 470 yuan. De Cheng took in 10 taels from Yong Cheng for 10,920 yuan. Heng Ji, Xiang He, and Yong Cheng sold up to 10,800 yuan. Finally, Ho Tai Bank took in again. At noon, De Fu rose to 10,900 yuan. De Cheng reappeared with 10 taels. The noon closing was 10,890 yuan. In the afternoon, Heng Ji first sold 10 taels for 10,900 yuan, a 10-yuan increase. Xiang He and De Cheng competed to take in, and the price soared to 400 yuan. Ho Tai Bank took in 50 taels from Shun Yuan for a high price of 11,300 yuan. Soon after, it suddenly released over 200 taels, and De Fu and Tian Yuan also sold, retreating to 11,100 yuan. Cheng Ji, Xiang He, He Sheng, and Xin Feng Yong competed to take in, and the price rose again to 11,300 yuan. Finally, Xiang Xing Yong, Tian Yuan, and He Sheng sold, and De Cheng reappeared. The closing price was 11,200 yuan, up 1,140 yuan from last Saturday's noon closing. The high and low for the day was 850 yuan. A total of 1,600 taels were traded. The listed price of gold shops was 11,300 yuan, with the buying price 100-200 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Futures Follow with a Rise of 320 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the October futures (10 taels per contract), opened at 9:30 am amidst a consensus upward buying trend, opening 20 yuan higher, at 7,970 yuan, 20 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon closing. Lian Xing, Heng Ji, Tian Yuan, De Fu, and Cheng Da successively aggressively bought. The tightening of foreign exchange and cash approaching 11,000 yuan further deterred sellers. The price then rose by 180 yuan, breaking through the 8,000 yuan mark, soaring to a noon closing of 8,150 yuan. The afternoon opening was 8,150 yuan. Yu Tai Feng, He Sheng, Cheng Da, and Xin Feng Yong aggressively bought, with few sellers. The price then rose by 170 yuan, rising to 8,320 yuan. Finally, Tian Yuan sold. The closing price at 4:00 pm was 8,270 yuan, up 320 yuan from last Saturday's closing price, with a high and low of 350 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Unprecedented Tightness of American Black Market Exchange Rate: Only 3.625 Yuan Can Be Settled; US Dollars Reach 35.20 Yuan <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market remained bullish. For example, British and American gold pounds each rose several tens of yuan. British gold tickets rose three yuan. American gold tickets once reached an unprecedented price of 35.20 yuan due to frequent use for settling Dutch sugar, and finally settled at 33.5 yuan, a massive increase of 5.8 yuan compared to last week. This kind of price increase should not have happened, as it could mislead people into thinking that the size of the legal tender has changed that much. One cannot help but suspect that the US government, in freezing Chinese and Japanese funds, still leaves this convertible American exchange rate to disrupt the market. Moreover, Dutch sugar has been imported in large quantities for days and also re-exported in large quantities for days, continuously. It is essentially using Shanghai US dollars to trade, so how could US dollars not rise sharply? The US side turns a blind eye, making people suspect that freezing is a kind of business deal. Hong Kong tickets are also in demand. The market price continues to rise sharply. The Japanese gold ticket also rose sharply, with the evening market reaching 2.67 yuan. Korean tickets also rose to 2.11 yuan. In addition, tickets such as Singapore tickets also tended to rise.</p>
<p>The central bank and HSBC exchange rates did not move yesterday. HSBC's small counter price remained the same. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies tightened even more sharply. Unprecedented tight prices emerged one after another. Import firms that were not allowed to apply frantically tried to obtain them, even settling with a private individual for a price of only 3.6875 yuan. Later, there was a demand for over 100,000 US dollars at 3.625 yuan, but it was difficult to find a counterparty. The market trend only tightened and did not retreat. Until the evening closing, the British exchange rate also tightened to 2/1875, and the American exchange rate to 3.625 yuan (still with demand exceeding supply), with the British exchange rate tighter by .0625 and the American exchange rate tighter by .375 compared to last Saturday's noon closing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 13th (Weekly): The exchange market opened sluggish this morning. All currencies had no rise or fall.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 13th (Monday): The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer still stood at the previous market. The New York telegraphic transfer eased by 125 to 5 yuan. The Shanghai exchange fell by 50 cents to 94.5 yuan. The interbank dark market rose by 1.5 cents to 4/6.25 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Also Stimulated; East Goods Futures Market Hits Limit Up <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market first remained flat and then rose, due to the obstruction of actual sales and the increasing tightening of foreign exchange, stimulating sentiment. Short sellers scrambled to cover, so cloth prices were flat in the morning market and soared in the afternoon. Coarse and fine cloth twill rose 50 cents to 1.5 yuan per piece, bleached and dyed cloth rose about 1 yuan, and velvet cloth was peaceful. About 800 pieces were traded in this street, with hoarders absorbing the most.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Due to the soaring gold price, Double Horse yarn rose sharply to the limit up. The futures cloth for each month on the exchange also rose wildly by 3.40 yuan to 4 yuan per piece. The later market's far months were only bid at the first lot. This month's reached the second lot, closing at 65 yuan. People's hearts were restless, reaching the extreme. Since cargo transport is not open, today's limit up might be tomorrow's limit down. The spot price increases more slowly. Medium grade fine cloths and fine twills only rose 1 yuan. The highest opening price for premium fine cloth was 68 yuan, closing slightly down at 67.60 yuan, up 3.6 yuan. Si Jun Zi serge's new order was 2.445 yuan, also rising sharply by about 10 cents per yard. Today, there were 90 pieces of East cloth shipped to Hong Kong and 4 pieces to Siam.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Is It Buying and Selling... Or Gambling Big or Small? <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>

<p>The yarn market has turned upward again, and the bullish trend is quite strong. This is because the soaring gold price makes speculation active and buying interest is reborn. The market generally advances, but actual transactions have disappeared due to the disapproval of customs declaration and transport. Yesterday's transaction volume was 11,001 bales, said to be 12,000 bales, all speculative transactions. Only one bale was for an inland buyer. Seeing this situation, why talk about doing business? It would be more straightforward to say "gambling big or small, winning or losing," which would be an honest act.</p>
<p>Although yarn, cloth, silk, and knitted goods are not allowed for customs declaration and export, "special permits" can still be shipped. Therefore, yesterday there were 80 pieces of Japanese yarn shipped to Siam and 10 pieces to Hong Kong. In fact, why bother doing this? Even if it is nominally Chinese factory yarn and cloth, after the hands of the dyeing and weaving factory, which piece is not that product? Not to mention dyed goods, even grey fabrics are no different. The mainland is feigning ignorance, and the maritime side is putting on airs. Everyone knows what's going on, so there's no need to play act.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, due to the big drop on the weekend, sentiment was not good. The first lot immediately fell 43 yuan, to 1,960 yuan. The situation was mediocre at this time, fluctuating between 1,970 and 1,980 yuan. Subsequently, as cash was jumping, sentiment was high, and it rose out of the 2,000 yuan mark. However, the momentum was still moderate. By the third closing of the exchange, it rose, the buyers in the market were active, and the counter was dry. The market gradually advanced to 1,995 yuan. The noon closing was 1,985 yuan. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 2,103 yuan, and the low price was 1,960 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening rose sharply, because cash was strong, and buyers on the counter came one after another. It initially opened at 1,995 yuan, but all reached inside, and the shouts were loud. In an instant, it rose to 2,103 yuan, announcing a limit up. The exchange's yarn and cloth also jumped to the limit up. For a time, people were flustered. Rumors spread that Japanese yarn in the occupied areas could be transported, so dark market trading of Transfiguration Horse was still prosperous, continuously rising to 2,150 yuan. The final price was 2,142 yuan, with the difference between the first lot price in the morning of 1,960 yuan and the high and low of 190 yuan. In this situation, those who make money are certainly energetic, and those who lose money don't know what to do. Recently, rising and falling make people feel scared. However, the trend of cotton yarn is still in the angry waves, because part of the wind and waves is getting more energetic, making the winning and losing history more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The Golden Double Horse futures market was slightly tired and then soared, unexpectedly rising to the limit up again. The firm rise and fall caused great panic among short sellers. The early opening in the morning softened with factory orders, and most people were bearish, and floating long orders were sold. October opened at 1/830 yuan, a small cut of 35 yuan. After entering, the factory orders were suddenly affected and soared due to the sharp reduction in black market exchange rates. Generally weak short sellers may have been hit by this. Looking at the future, there is a lack of bearish news for a while, so once it rises, they compete to escape and cover, and the market flies. The price of futures and spot goods is strong, creating an arrogant momentum of rising together, with a high and low difference of up to 130 yuan throughout the day. November opened at 1,832 yuan, and December opened at 1,870 yuan. The noon closing had already risen by more than ten yuan to sixty yuan. The afternoon trend was even stronger, and the buyers' pull was particularly strong. Spot yarn opened and immediately announced a limit up, and futures yarn gradually followed. The far-month first lots also hit the limit up. The near-term to the second lot also hit the limit up. However, the November term must be higher than the October term, and due to the difference in the weekend's ups and downs, although each hit the limit up, the price of the November term was the lowest. Buyers need to pay attention. As a result, each closed at the highest limit up, and the market closed up by more than one hundred yuan. A table is listed below:</p>

<p>The spot cotton situation has turned upward, because the black market exchange rate has shrunk and the yarn market has rebounded, so the attitude of those who hold the goods is getting stronger, and the price has increased by seven or eight yuan to ten yuan compared with last week. However, the factory side sees that the market price is too high and the factory needs are not urgent, so they have to wait and see, so only the numbers are mutually transferred.</p>

<h3 id="e38">All Bonds Fall in Unison <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday's market suddenly experienced a huge drop, and Type C continuously broke three levels. After breaking through 71 yuan, it broke through the 70 yuan mark in the afternoon and even broke through 69 yuan at one point. All other types also fell miserably. The old bulls did not sell off, only those with a lot sold off. It has already fallen so much, but the Sichuanese are still constantly selling. The afternoon already felt scarce, and the drop not only did not stop but became more severe. It is not known what kind of people these people are, and they have such a large number of government bonds, selling them all. Some say that because the highest price of government bonds, no matter how it exceeds the face value, is not as good as doing other business, people's hearts are floating, and many sell off, so they feel even more unsupported. Yesterday morning, Type C opened, and Xin Fu, He Feng, Xin Hua, and ordinary retail investors absorbed it quite lively, and the opening price was 73.4 yuan, slightly higher to 4.5 yuan. Initially, Da Zhong and Xie Da sold off, followed by Yi Chang, Yi Zhong, and the Sichuanese Shi Long and Hou De. Tong Kang and Hou De continued to sell off, and the market price slowly declined, and after breaking through one yuan, it closed with a minimum price of .06 yuan. Other types could not fall sharply, close to one yuan. In the afternoon, the Sichuanese did not have significant sell-offs, but the drop intensified. Type C opened and fell by .3 yuan, and Jiu Feng, Lian He, Xie Xing, Yuan Xin, and Feng Ren all sought to sell. The market only had Tong Shun, Hu He Ji, and Xin Hua buying back, and retail investors also took in at low prices, but before long, the 70 yuan mark for Type C was broken. In the midst of extremely strong selling pressure, the 69 yuan level was broken again. After entering, the selling pressure was weak, and it slightly returned by .2 or .3 yuan. This trend, because various Chinese and foreign yarn markets and gold, etc., are not greatly increased, or even suspended, is enough to reflect the price of government bonds. The market price resulted in a drop of 1.4 yuan to 1.95 yuan across the board, and the total transaction volume was approximately 2.45 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange were traded, with each share being 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Zhongye Stock Market: The bullish trend was intense, and people's hearts were extremely chaotic, because everyone had oversensitive speculation about the future of the legal tender. The opening price rose slightly, and soon buyers were active and all stocks jumped wildly. Although there were not few people who took profits, they were ultimately no match for the violent buying interest, and as a result, all rose sharply compared to the previous closing. Rubber stocks rose more than industrial stocks.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the rice market rose sharply, and the price of small straining rice rose by as much as 10 yuan. Other varieties rose by 6, 7, or 8 yuan. The rice market had long been supported by large bulk merchants, and once it was unexpectedly stimulated, the market price was immediately pushed up. The opening price in the market yesterday morning was absorbed and increased by bulk merchants. The price was then affected by the sharp rise in the US dollar, and the goods owners were hoarding, the bulk merchants were releasing prices, and merchants were scrambling to trade, with new bulk merchants and Swatow merchants being greedy. The small pattern rice opened at 128 yuan and reached as high as 133 yuan. The afternoon buying interest was very strong, and the evening closing had already called for 136 or 137 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to Saturday's evening closing. The Yinghua Company's small pattern rice was already opening at 151 yuan on Saturday, and yesterday morning it was 157 yuan, then 160 yuan, 61 yuan, and 161.5 yuan. It was still being called high in the afternoon. The total transaction volume for Yinghua Company was 1,500 tons, and there were 35,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Ming Sheng ship arrived in port last Saturday, carrying 11,417 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. A certain Dutch ship also arrived in Shanghai on the same Saturday. In addition to carrying a large amount of sugar from Java, there were also 1,000 tons of Javanese foreign rice, more than 10,500 bags, berthed at the Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. (Grandfather)</p>
<p>The domestic rice market, including Thick and Thin New Broken Geng and New Du Jian, etc., was not smooth because the sources of new products from various producing areas in the interior decided that the number of sources would increase day by day, and because the sales market was being pressured by foreign rice. Therefore, although foreign rice was surging in the morning market, domestic rice was still flat. Directly after the market, foreign rice became a sensation, and a violent rise began, and the goods owners held on without releasing them, and all shouted wildly, but because the shouting was too fierce, it made the guests thorny, and there were no transactions until the close, and the potential was tight, and the selling prices of the goods were all the same as the week before, and the price of the goods was the same as the week before, with the early breaking of the Southern Port from 154 yuan to 151 yuan. Kunshan New Geng 154 yuan to 150 yuan, New Du Jian 131 yuan to 129 yuan, Qingjiao Kiln 154 yuan, followed by 151 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, amid the sharp reduction in the black market exchange rate and the high rise of gold, oil merchants were all overjoyed, and the style of raising prices became more intensified. Qingdao raw oil and Dalian soybean oil in the dark market were raised by 20-30 yuan fiercely. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil were also slightly raised by about 10 yuan. The total market transacted more than 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil and more than 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 300 loads of Dalian refined oil, and more than 2,000 loads of rapeseed oil from various factories.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose step by step due to the sharp reduction in the US dollar, and people's hearts were tense, which was uncontrollable. The situation was chaotic to the point of being turbulent, causing the market to pause at one point. For example, the first market price of the currently available 24-group white arriving in September was 188 yuan, but it suddenly rose to 98 yuan, and then returned to 94 yuan and 93 yuan. Those arriving in August were 187 yuan to 97 yuan, returning to 92 yuan. Those arriving in July were 185 yuan, gradually raised to 95 yuan, and slightly to 90 yuan. Hong Kong crude was 174 yuan, gradually rising 78 yuan to 83 yuan, and then returning to 76.5 yuan, resulting in 80 yuan. Taikoo East White HX was 180 yuan and 5 corners, an increase of 13.5 yuan compared to the previous market. Dutch Red was 158 yuan, with a gradual increase of 65 yuan to 75 yuan, and the final price was 70 yuan. The company's futures crude white's October 20-term opening price was 181 yuan, jumping to 90 yuan, resulting in a stop. The dark disk was pegged at 8 yuan to 4 yuan, and the end-of-month term opened at 192 yuan, pegged after the stop. Yuan to five yuan. The current goods were raised by a degree of ten yuan more than the previous market, and the futures had to rise by a degree of twenty yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Yesterday's Market Was Abnormally Distorted, Financial Circles Did Not Pay Attention, No Results for Applying for Foreign Exchange for Non-Essential Goods, Scavenging for U.S. Dollar Notes Led to Market Fluctuations, Sufficient Supply of Foreign Exchange for Daily Necessities <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Stabilization Fund supplies foreign exchange for essential goods in this city, with the price still at one U.S. dollar converting to 18.6 yuan in legal tender. However, yesterday morning, the black market price of U.S. dollar notes soared to around 30 yuan. It is said this was caused by importers of non-essential goods in this city, who were not supplied with foreign exchange by the Stabilization Fund, vigorously purchasing U.S. dollar notes.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Fluctuations Not Surprising</p>
<p>It has been found that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, due to environmental factors, has not yet implemented the government's decree to prohibit the import of goods banned during the emergency period. All luxury goods, semi-luxury goods, and non-essential goods prohibited by the government are still able to be declared to Jianghai Customs, imported, and sold. These merchants only care about their own interests, continue to order and ship goods to Shanghai for sale, and have even petitioned the Stabilization Fund to supply foreign exchange, which was rejected. After being refused supply, they secretly bought and sold foreign exchange with various exporters, resulting in the so-called "abnormal foreign exchange." However, this phenomenon is temporary and unrelated to the overall foreign exchange market in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Application for Foreign Exchange for Non-Essential Goods Rejected</p>
<p>According to economic circles, the sharp contraction of black market exchange rates and U.S. dollar notes was expected. Since the Stabilization Fund stopped supplying foreign exchange to the black market last month, the only foreign exchange it can supply is for certain designated essential goods. In other words, all goods not listed by the Stabilization Fund as eligible for foreign exchange cannot obtain foreign exchange. However, foreign luxury goods, etc., are still purchased by wealthy people at high prices. Even though operators know that legitimate foreign exchange cannot be obtained, they are unwilling to stop their operations, so they try their best to grab foreign exchange positions on the black market. The positions in the black market are limited, and there are many grabbing them. Under the imbalance of supply and demand, how can the black market exchange rate not shrink sharply? After representatives of various industries in Shanghai, who were not allowed to apply for foreign exchange, went to Hong Kong to request the Stabilization Fund to approve the supply of foreign exchange, news has now come that they have been rejected again. This will also inevitably lead to the pursuit of positions, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>Value of Legal Tender Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>A certain person continued, "Although the black market exchange rate has contracted, it has little to do with the daily lives of ordinary citizens. Because the Stabilization Fund continues to supply the foreign exchange needed for essential goods as usual, and the exchange rate has never changed, the prices of essential goods will naturally not change. It must be understood that the contraction of the black market exchange rate affects non-essential goods. We ordinary citizens only need to be well-fed and clothed, and have no other desires. The price increase of those non-essential goods can be ignored, and there is no need for panic or worry. As for the general perception that this contraction of the black market exchange rate is a devaluation of the legal tender, it is not known that the external value of the legal tender, judging from the unchanged legal exchange rate of the Central Bank, shows that it is as stable as ever. In the black market, due to speculators creating waves, the situation is out of the ordinary, and it is by no means sufficient to test the value of the currency."</p>
<p>Although There is Much Domestic Goods, Demand Is Limited</p>
<p>According to business circles, the cost of living in Shanghai is increasing day by day. The main reason is the hoarding of daily necessities. According to reliable estimates, the total value of hoarded daily necessities such as rice, coal, cotton yarn, flour, rubber, hardware, and other commodities exceeds 90 million yuan. Among them, rice, coal, and cotton yarn account for about one-fifth. If all of these hoarded commodities are sold, they would be sufficient for Shanghai's consumption for a long period of time, which is an undeniable fact. However, most merchants are unwilling to affect their capital, so they hold on to the hoarded goods and refuse to sell them. However, the result of hoarding raw materials is reduced production in factories, because the price of raw materials is higher than the selling price of goods, so how can factories manufacture goods? For example, the price of nails is now much lower than the price of iron. According to recent estimates, the hoarded commodities include 270,000 bales of cotton yarn, 180,000 tons of rice, and 400,000 tons of coal, with a total value of over 31 million yuan at market prices. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions can pay close attention in a timely manner and impose sanctions on these traitors.</p>
<p>Distribution of Legal Tender Exchange Rate is Quite Satisfactory</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the exchange rates quoted by the 14 Allied banks in the city today remained unchanged. According to a certain staff member of one of the banks, none of the 14 banks were involved in illegal transactions. According to the current method, the distribution of foreign exchange by the Stabilization Fund is quite satisfactory and can continue for many days because the Stabilization Fund has a large amount of funds available for allocation. Speculators are taking advantage of this opportunity to engage in activities, but the Stabilization Fund has been studying various methods to adjust the situation and will soon make changes. At the same time, the value of Japanese military scrip fell to 2.5 yuan this morning due to the impact of the news of the Chinese army's victory in northern Hunan. Last Saturday, it was 2.75 yuan.</p>

<p>Due to the rising prices of various goods, the Municipal Council will further study the subsidies for the families of lower-level staff and police officers. Therefore, a meeting was held in the Municipal Council meeting room at 4:30 p.m. on the 13th to discuss the matter. It is likely that the subsidy ratio will be around 10%, and those with monthly salaries of 600 to 700 yuan will be eligible for this subsidy. The results are not yet known.</p>
<h3 id="e45">After the Ban on the Export of Yarn and Cloth, No Permits for Customs Clearance Have Been Approved, Foreign Shipping Companies Have Greatly Reduced Freight Volume, Trade with Third Countries Has Been Completely Deprived <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news yesterday, the various foreign shipping companies in this port have not transported cotton yarn and cotton fabrics for export since the Jianghai Customs was forced to announce on the 8th of this month that "except for special permission, the export of yarn and cloth to any location is prohibited." Although the Jianghai Customs announcement stated that shipment could be allowed after special permission, the various foreign shipping companies in this port have not yet received customs clearance forms for the consignment of yarn and cloth from various transportation companies. This shows that this move by Jianghai Customs has almost completely deprived third countries of their free trade rights. Therefore, the cargo loaded on ships for export in recent days has been greatly reduced. Furthermore, it is said that it is also very difficult for ordinary merchants to obtain transportation permits if they want to transport cloth to the occupied areas. As for cotton yarn, the Japanese have long absolutely prohibited its transportation to the occupied areas.</p>
<h3 id="e46">From Now On, Foreign Nationals Leaving Shanghai Are All Personal Actions, Although the Situation in the Far East is Tense, Foreign Nationals are Calm, U.S. Officials Believe That the Evacuation of Nationals is a Thing of the Past <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The failure of U.S.-Japan negotiations has caused relations between the two countries to become tense again. The Japanese government plans to send three ships to transport U.S. nationals from various parts of Japan back to their country, and to welcome Japanese nationals in the United States back to their country. This matter yesterday caused a rapid reaction among the people in this port, fearing that the foreign nationals of relevant countries in the Far East (including Shanghai) would have a widespread evacuation. However, according to a report by a "New Voice" reporter yesterday who inquired with the relevant authorities of various countries, the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries that had issued orders to evacuate foreign nationals from the Far East, believe that the increasingly serious situation in the Far East is not enough to increase or decrease the established evacuation policy of their respective countries. In fact, the evacuation of foreign nationals from Shanghai can be said to have come to a satisfactory conclusion. From now on, the travel of foreign nationals will only be regarded as personal actions and will have nothing to do with the overall national policy.</p>
<p>The Evacuation of U.S. Nationals Has Been Successfully Completed</p>
<p>The first country to evacuate foreign nationals from Shanghai was the United States. After October last year, the "Monterey," "Mariposa," and "Washington" special ships came to Shanghai one after another to transport nationals back to their country. Subsequently, the American Chamber of Commerce in this port, the American Association, and the American General Association jointly organized an evacuation committee with the official authorities to promote the evacuation plan for foreign nationals who did not need to stay. By the beginning of this year, the U.S. Consulate General declared that the evacuation had come to a satisfactory conclusion, and the evacuation committee temporarily suspended its work. Although there have been occasional evacuations of U.S. nationals since then, their number is very small. According to inquiries made by reporters with the U.S. Consulate, the original number of U.S. nationals in Shanghai was over 4,000. After the evacuation, only 850 remain, including about 600 men and about 250 women. These 800-plus people all have important business and other relationships with Shanghai, and will not evacuate unless absolutely necessary. At present, U.S. officials believe that the issue of national evacuation is a thing of the past, and the departure of foreign nationals from Shanghai from now on does not imply evacuation.</p>
<p>Will Never Give Up Interests in Shanghai</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired about the matter of evacuating foreign nationals with a certain American merchant, who said, "The evacuation of foreign nationals is often misunderstood as 'giving up the interests in the place where the foreign nationals are located.' In fact, this is a big mistake. Speaking of the evacuation of U.S. nationals, all those who have been evacuated are women, children, the old and weak, while those who have not been evacuated are the leaders who are responsible for maintaining the entire U.S. interests, or the mainstay of trade, or official envoys, or military personnel. The fact that these two types of people will never be evacuated shows that the United States has no intention of giving up the concessions in Shanghai. Some people with ulterior motives often spread rumors, saying that the United States will withdraw its troops stationed in Shanghai, and that the United States will give up trade in Shanghai. Whether these words are true or false is now known. "He continued, "As far as I personally know and believe, the current situation in the Far East will not affect the U.S. position in Shanghai, nor will it cause a rapid change in the U.S. policy towards Shanghai."</p>
<p>Those Who Remain in Shanghai Are All Necessary Personnel</p>
<p>As for the evacuation of British nationals, although the authorities had previously issued orders, the progress was far less active than that of the U.S. nationals. In the past, although some British nationals in Shanghai left, it did not imply evacuation, and their number was very small. Therefore, the current number of British nationals remaining in Shanghai is still 4,500, including 2,900 men and 1,600 women, ranking fourth after Japanese, Jewish, and White Russian nationals. Yesterday, the reporter inquired with the relevant authorities about the evacuation of British nationals, who said, "The evacuation order of the authorities is not mandatory. If there are those who wish to evacuate, the authorities will assist them." In addition, the evacuation of foreign nationals from the Netherlands and Switzerland has stopped. On the one hand, the number of people is not large, and on the other hand, almost all foreign nationals are necessary personnel. Those who have been evacuated are only women and children. Foreign nationals from the Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Australia, Greece, Norway, Spain, and other countries are all calm as usual and have no sense of unease.</p>

<p>After the Chinese army recaptured Yichang on the morning of the 10th of this month, it immediately swept up the scattered Japanese troops entrenched in various buildings in the city, and expanded its victory in various suburbs of Yichang. The Japanese side denied a few days ago that the Chinese army had recaptured Yichang, saying that the Chinese army had only broken through the first line of defense of the Japanese army, and Yichang was still "secured" by the Japanese army. According to the Hankou telegram published in the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" yesterday, the Japanese army is launching a counterattack on Yichang. This shows that the recapture of Yichang by the Chinese army is indeed a fact, and even the Japanese side cannot deny it. According to the newspaper, "The Chinese army, which broke through the first line of defense of the Japanese army near Dangyang and Yichang on the night of the 10th, was composed of about 30,000 soldiers from the Fifth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Divisions under the command of Li Zongren, commander of the Fifth War Zone. The Japanese troops waiting for a counterattack, including the troops of Hayabuchi, Yoshikawa, Murai, Sasaki, Watanabe, Fukunaga, Kubota, and Kashiwagi, began to attack from Shuibeidian and Xindian, west of Dangyang, at noon on the 11th. At the same time, the Japanese air force also dispatched to assist in the battle, attacking Yaque Ridge, a stronghold on the periphery of Yichang, at dawn on the 12th, and continuing to launch a fierce attack on Yichang. The troops of Suzuki and Yamamoto in Yichang also began to advance rapidly, adopting an encirclement posture against the Chinese army."</p>

<p>It was learned yesterday (the 12th) that the Shanghai church groups have received a telegram from the German missionaries in Changsha, asking for help to get them out of the city and to send British or American missionaries to take over their hospitals and other work. It is likely that the Chinese side has decided to instruct these German missionaries to leave the city, because when the Japanese army invaded Changsha, the Axis nationals in the city had pro-Japanese behavior.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Machine-made Noodle Industry Association, the Cake and Bun Industry Association, and other organizations specially sent Zhu Zhenfang, Wang Jinwen, Zhang Guanshou, Li Baoquan, etc., yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. to submit a document to the Municipal Council petitioning them to inform the various flour mills to purchase foreign wheat, start their operations as soon as possible, and request the allocation of large sums of money to purchase foreign flour, transport it to Shanghai, and sell it at a stable price. The person in charge of the Municipal Council invited and approved it, and summoned various foreign firms and flour merchants to discuss the purchase of flour, and sent personnel to advise the various flour merchants not to raise market prices without authorization. At the same time, they will conduct a thorough study and improvement of the hardships of the various businesses using flour. The representatives were satisfied and said goodbye. After the authorities resolutely dealt with edible oil in response to social demands, the oil merchants have gradually woken up and have no intention of continuing to make waves in the market. All goods traded on the spot and in futures are traded according to regulations, but major households, although quoting prices to quickly sell off and realize cash, are still disliked by buyers for being too high, and have no intention of adding to their holdings. As a result, people's hearts are united downwards, and the market situation is showing a downward trend. However, all the rumors circulating are completely unfounded and not credible. The reporter also learned from another source that the amount of raw soybean oil traded in Shanghai in the past few days is considerable. The edible oil will be shipped to Shanghai by the various ordering parties before the end of this month to meet market demand, so the selling price of edible oil will soon fall sharply.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Police Department has recently erected a wire mesh frame at the intersection of Connaught Road and Hart Road in the western district of Shanghai, and has also built a fortress, which is guarded by armed White Russian merchant groups. Beside the wire mesh, one Western police officer and four Chinese police officers are on guard. In addition, at the intersection of Connaught Road and Yenping Road, which is a short distance away, a wire mesh frame is also erected in the same way. Pedestrians and vehicles must pass through the gaps. When security is implemented, patrolling detectives will carry out search work. There are more than a dozen other similar measures in nearby western sections, including Avenue Road, Edinburgh Road, and Avenue Foch. Although there are no commemorative festivals, the security work has not been relaxed in the slightest. This is enough to show that the authorities are taking strict and effective security measures for the defense of the concession at any time and anywhere.</p>

<p>At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the Japanese military police sent six soldiers in a car to the French General Police Station, requesting that additional detectives be dispatched to conduct a search together in the residence at No. 868 Avenue Petain for about an hour. At that time, the owner of the house did not know the reason, which caused a misunderstanding and reported the incident to the Avenue Foch Police Station, saying that there was a theft. The police station immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives and a police car to surround and arrest the suspects. However, after the detectives entered the house, they learned the truth and immediately withdrew. As a result of the search by the Japanese soldiers, the owner of the house, surnamed Liu (from Shaoxing, a paper merchant), was arrested and taken to the French General Police Station for questioning. The reason is unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Dark Secrets of the Sea Are Full of Wonders, A Slippery Money Shop Only Open for One Day, Opened on the 8th, Cheated Deposits and Closed Down That Evening, Four of the Five Shareholders Arrested and Detained for Investigation <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the opening of money shops and banks in the Public Concession of this port is like bamboo shoots after a rain. Although there are not a few with strong capital and excellent credit, there are also not a few that are close to fraud and whose internal affairs are unimaginable. On the 8th of this month, there was suddenly an advertisement in the newspaper for the opening of the Huikang Money Shop at No. 10 Jiyi Lane, No. 195 Tianjin Road, inviting Mr. Wen Lanting, a well-known social figure, to perform the opening ceremony. Judging from its appearance, it seemed to be a large-scale money shop with strong capital. Unexpectedly, it closed down after only one day of opening, which is an unprecedented novelty in the silver and money industry. The corruption of its contents is unimaginable. Now, this case has been broken by the Central Police Station because it defrauded many depositors and was reported. The details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fictitious Business Name</p>
<p>Chen Zengwei, a 25-year-old from Baoshan, is an amateur in the silver and money business. Recently, seeing the prosperity of silver shops and money shops, and believing that it is easier to make profits, he gathered five people, Wang Yifan, Gu Yao Kui from Shaoxing, Xu Zhan Dao, and Huang Kefu, to discuss opening the Huikang Money Shop with a fixed capital of 100,000 yuan, with each contributing 20,000 yuan. When starting the business, they first paid one-tenth of the capital and signed a draft contract. They then rented a house at No. 10 Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, and began preparations. After a week of decoration, they announced the opening, appointing Chen Zengwei as the manager and Huang Kefu as the assistant manager.</p>
<p>Fraudulently Obtaining Materials</p>
<p>They first widely attracted depositors from various relatives and friends to absorb deposits (commonly known as "hanging red"). Then, Xu Jingxing, the owner of the Dafeng Woolen Shop on Jixiang Street in the Public Concession, and Wu Minfu, the owner of the Minfu Customs Brokerage on No. 114 Jiangxi Road, etc., agreed to deposit money out of consideration for face, with Xu depositing 5,000 yuan and Wu depositing 2,500 yuan, both paid in one lump sum. On the 5th, Xu urgently needed money, so he wrote a check and sent someone to the Huikang Money Shop to withdraw a deposit of 2,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, the shop replied that there was no cash and first issued a check from the Kenye Bank. Knowing that the check could not be cashed, they transferred a promissory note with a 10-day term from the shop. When Xu went to the shop to cash the note, the so-called manager and assistant manager had already absconded.</p>
<p>Four Criminals Captured</p>
<p>Only two tea servants who were not responsible were left in the shop. Knowing that they had been cheated, they took them to the General Police Station to report. Chief Detective Zhu Wanjun and Detective Wang Zhenfei were assigned to investigate and first went to the Huikang Money Shop to search. There were no account books inside. Later, it was learned that the manager Chen Zengwei was hiding in Room 602 of the Dafang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. Together with the detectives of the French Police Station, they went to the address and arrested Chen, seizing 1,690 yuan in cash. Later, they went to the upper floor of the New Peace Company at No. 437 Nanjing Road and continued to arrest Wang Yifan, Gu Yaokui, and Xu Zhan Dao. (Xu injured his back when he jumped out of the building window to escape and is now hospitalized. Assistant Manager Huang Kefu is on the run and has not been captured.) All were detained in the police station for custody.</p>
<p>Cheating the Public</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu detailed the above situation, saying that the defendants had opened a slippery money shop and defrauded many depositors, which not only cheated the public but also damaged the credit of the money industry. The police station had not had time to conduct a detailed investigation and requested permission for detention. Then, Wu Minfu testified that he had deposited 2,500 yuan into the Huikang Money Shop, holding a passbook. The next day, the 9th of this month, he withdrew 500 yuan due to urgent need and was now defrauded of 2,000 yuan. Xu Jingxing also testified that he had deposited 5,000 yuan on the 8th and went to withdraw 3,000 yuan on the 8th without success. After first paying a check from the Kenye Bank, he then transferred a promissory note. When he went to collect it on the 11th, it had already closed down.</p>
<p>Slippery Money Shop</p>
<p>When Chen Zengwei was questioned, he confessed that the Huikang Money Shop was initially opened by four of us and Huang Kefu, who is on the run, with a capital of 100,000 yuan, with each contributing 10,000 yuan, first paying one-tenth and then paying one-tenth of the capital every month. Unexpectedly, by the deadline, the remaining shareholders did not pay a penny because they were instigated by others. I borrowed 3,000 yuan personally to start the business. There were no formal account books in the shop, only draft accounts, using a notepad to record accounts in pencil. On the day of the opening, we received a total of about 10,000 yuan in deposits. After repaying the 3,000 yuan loan, the remaining funds were used to pay for furniture and other expenses. Wang Yifan and Gu Yaokui both confessed that they initially cooperated with Chen Zengwei and signed a draft contract. Later, Chen demanded that he take half of the profits, so they did not sign and withdrew, and Chen opened the business independently. Judge Dai verified the confessions and ruled that the defendants be detained for a later date to investigate and verify.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Dance Hostess After Leaving Occupation, Absconding Arrested <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Infected with Bad Habits, Repeatedly Advised But Not Changed, Squandering Money to the Point of Absconding</p>
<p>Lu Yi (28 years old), a Cantonese staff member of the Yi Pin Bank, met Ding Zhifang (28 years old), a Wuxi dance hostess at the Lido Ballroom three years ago. Lu fell in love at first sight and lived with Ding at No. 233 Avenue Edward VII. After living together, he discovered that Ding had very deep bad habits. Because Lu loved her deeply, he tried three times to help Ding quit, but Ding relapsed after quitting and was ultimately unable to quit. Later, she became addicted to gambling, throwing away money like water, causing Lu's accumulated assets to be exhausted by Ding. When he could not afford it anymore, he pawned his clothes and accessories. When that was not enough, he forced Lu to borrow money. Lu accompanied and served her all night long. Although Lu was in great pain, he always hoped to persuade her to change her ways and start anew. However, this plan ultimately failed. Recently, Ding saw that Lu was penniless and intended to abandon Lu. She fell in love with Chen Yuan Wu (also known as Ji Biao) and, on September 22, absconded with all of Lu's clothes and accessories, worth about 7,000 gold, and her whereabouts were unknown. After suffering this stimulus, Lu tried his best to find Ding's whereabouts. He recently found out that Ding had moved to No. 20, Apartment 16, Lane 035, Avenue Haig, so he reported it to the Avenue Haig Police Station. Detective Han Kaiyuan arrested Ding and Shen Wenying, a woman from Changshu who lived with her, on the 11th and seized a diamond ring, 34 pawn tickets, and silverware. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin requested temporary detention for investigation. After Judge Shen questioned them, they were ordered to be detained and questioned again at a later date.</p>

<p>As the reporter jumped off the rickshaw, he saw a man as pale as a corpse in front of him. He was vomiting from excessive drinking and collapsed to the ground. No one paid any attention to him. After a few seconds, the man raised his head, crawled to the door, and sat down with his head drooping. A fat foreign woman, wearing a nightgown and slippers, came over and tugged at the reporter's sleeve, accosting him in Russian. The reporter shook his head and pushed through the crowd, hearing a cacophony of voices - Russian, German, Nordic, English, and Chinese, all mixed together, filling the air. Suddenly, he heard a retching sound and quickly dodged, only to see an ugly European woman, her hair dishevelled, leaning out of the window and vomiting, the stench of alcohol unbearable.</p>
<p>A skinny Russian, looking like a skeleton, lightly bumped into the reporter and asked, "Want a woman?" The reporter nodded and followed him into a foul-smelling dark room, almost tripping over two sailors who were lying drunk on the floor. They entered a small room with six scantily clad women sitting inside, two of whom were Russian or Jewish, the rest Chinese, all looking like they were addicted to drugs. The reporter took out a dollar and was about to explain that he had come to see the place, but the door was suddenly opened, and a woman immediately pushed the reporter into the next room. The room was dimly lit, and in one corner, a woman was sitting on a bed, inhaling something from a piece of paper. Upon closer inspection, the reporter saw that the woman was using two corner's new banknotes, rolled into a tube, to inhale white powder from a piece of tin foil. She even smiled at the reporter and asked, "Want to try some?"</p>
<p>The reporter peeked out through the crack in the door and saw the young man passed out on a chair, with several women trying to seduce him. After a long time, the young man said in broken English, "Can you do it?" A few seconds later, a woman led him into the next room.</p>
<p>The reporter returned to the dark room and saw a flickering light to the side. He went over to investigate and found two skinny Russian children, about twelve and fifteen years old, burning matches to heat tin foil, frantically inhaling white powder from the foil. The reporter returned to the main room and saw countless drug users. He guessed that about 75% of them looked like they were addicted to drugs. However, it was difficult to distinguish between drug addicts and alcoholics, so this estimate may not be accurate.</p>
<p>The reporter entered another dark room, where there were fewer people coming and going. A woman wearing only shorts was sitting in front of a brothel, smoking a cigarette with something on the paper. She only took a few puffs before extinguishing the cigarette. The reporter asked, "What's on the paper that you're smoking?" She replied, "Opium! Do you want to go inside?" The reporter nodded and was about to enter when a Chinese woman burst out of the door, followed by a tall foreigner who chased after her. He took a few steps, grabbed the woman, and dragged her back into the room. The woman in front of the door then said, "This woman smoked opium too early, which annoyed him. He's Russian, the boss here. Do you want to go in?"</p>
<p>The reporter, not wanting to have anything to do with the Russian, turned around and left. In a corner of the horizontal alley, two Chinese beggars were eating from a lead can on the ground, while opposite them, a disheveled blond foreigner was lying down, sniffing white powder from a small paper packet. This scene was truly like a hell on earth. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Soaring Infant Mortality Rate This Winter Even More Worrisome Pushan Villa Reports Causes of Death Hoping the Municipal Council Will Quickly Establish an Infant Hospital <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Mr. Lu, a staff member of Pushan Villa, told reporters that the lives of the poor are becoming more and more difficult. Currently, an average of 20 people die every day, and it is expected that the mortality rate will increase dramatically this winter. Therefore, the villa is now working hard to prepare for the busy season. The above mortality rate is limited to those buried by the villa. There is no way to count the others. If every death of a beggar in Shanghai is reported to the villa, it will be impossible to bury them all.</p>
<p>Daily Increase in Number of Deaths</p>
<p>In recent days, the mortality rate of beggars in Shanghai has been increasing daily. The number of reports received by the villa has been almost non-stop day and night. If the Municipal Council does not take measures as soon as possible, the number of deaths in winter will inevitably increase daily. This summer, there has been a lot of rain in the port, which has caused great inconvenience to the poor people in the city. This is one of the reasons for the increased mortality rate, as epidemics such as smallpox and dysentery spread very quickly. The poor are unable to treat their children, so the villa often receives reports and when they go to bury the bodies, many are not yet dead and cannot be saved. If the Municipal Council could establish a children's hospital, such unfortunate events could be reduced. However, there is no such much-needed hospital in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mostly Children Buried</p>
<p>In the past, the mortality rate of adults was lower. Most surprisingly, few of the dead beggars buried by them died of starvation. Most of them died from drug addiction. In mid-September, there were 1,828 bodies buried, of which only 642 were adults, the rest were children. Adult bodies are mostly buried in the Hongqiao area, and children's bodies are mostly buried in the Municipal Council cemetery. In the next two months, the number may increase to 500%, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>Hoping for a Steady Stream of Donations from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The cost of coffins for burying adults was 8 to 10 yuan each before the war, but has now increased to 50 yuan. Although the cost has increased dramatically, this work must continue. The villa is a public welfare organization that serves the public, so it is hoped that donors will provide a steady stream of funds so that they have sufficient funds to continue their work.</p>
<p>Hospitals Should be Established to be Solely Responsible</p>
<p>The total number of bodies collected last year was 19,440, of which 20,720 were children's bodies. Chinese beggars often abandon children when they are not yet dead. This is generally the mentality of their parents. These child beggars have no food or shelter and wander around all day, leading to death. The only solution is for hospitals to take them in. Before the war in 1937, the villa added such a hospital in Zhabei, taking in adults and children, but it has now been destroyed and there are no funds to rebuild it. The purpose of Pushan Villa is not only to bury bodies, but also to reduce the mortality rate as much as possible. This method can also reduce burial costs. The current scope of work is very small, so the villa can only be called a service organization and cannot seek welfare for the public. This is indeed the case.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Puyi Handicraft Cooperative Enthusiastic Donations <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Christian Puyi in Nanshi has been established for 25 years, serving the community with a high reputation. Since the war, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, it has imitated European and American methods to run a "handicraft cooperative." For three and a half years, it has benefited more than 100,000 poor people. In particular, its achievements in vocational training for unemployed young men and women, and in raising and educating the elderly and children, have been praised by Chinese and Western people. All the expenses of the cooperative have been voluntarily donated by benevolent women from all walks of life, which has enabled it to maintain its operations to this day. However, since the Westerners who regularly maintained it have withdrawn due to environmental reasons, and life has become difficult and prices have risen in recent years, donations have decreased significantly, while the number of ambitious refugees seeking employment and in need of relief has increased daily. The cooperative deeply feels that it is not easy to maintain the relief of more than 1,000 people every day, so it publicly calls on people from all walks of life to give sympathy and assistance. In recent days, enthusiastic people have been donating cash or clothing very enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Volunteer Doctors</p>
<p>A student from a hospital in this port, after reading the newspaper's report on the cooperative's volunteer clinic, which provides daily medical treatment and medicine to a large number of people, even nearly 6,000 people in the past month alone, felt that although he had a lot of enthusiasm, he felt that his heart was willing but his strength was not enough. Therefore, he wrote to the cooperative, willing to volunteer for the position of clinic doctor in his spare time.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations</p>
<p>Since this newspaper has repeatedly appealed to all walks of life on behalf of the cooperative, benevolent people have enthusiastically donated. The Customs Club donated 109 yuan, an anonymous old lady 100 yuan, Mr. Li Weibo of Pan'anji Insurance Company 100 yuan, Ms. Guo Baoyi 100 yuan, Ms. Yan Wangli 303 yuan, Mr. Zhang Rengui 500 yuan, 12 others donated a total of 225 yuan, and 12 Westerners donated 359 yuan and 87 cents.</p>
<p>Donation Collection Locations</p>
<p>The cooperative's target for this fundraising is 50,000 yuan. Currently, it relieves more than 1,000 people every day. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically and donate generously. Donation collection locations: (1) The cooperative's office on the second floor of 225 Hankou Road, (2) Tongfu Road Branch of Shanghai Bank, (3) Tuantuan Road Branch of Shanghai Bank, (4) Xiafei Road Branch of Shanghai Bank.</p>

<p>Hong Zhiling, a famous scholar in Anhui Province, whose name was Kui, had outstanding aspirations and a family heritage of learning. He studied in England in his early years. When he returned to China in the early years of the Republic of China, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, the Minister of Education, invited him to work together. He worked for more than ten years, successively serving as a professor at Beijing Normal University, Fada University, China University, and Advanced Police Academy. Later, he served as the Director of the Education Department of Anhui Province, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of Central University, and the Vice President of Nanda University after the Northern Expedition. He then served as the Chief of the Secretariat Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Library. After the outbreak of the war, he lived in seclusion in Shanghai. Last year, he went to Hong Kong at the invitation of friends to take a teaching position at the Tax School. Unfortunately, he suddenly contracted typhoid fever and died in Hong Kong last month at the age of only 56. He was deeply involved in Chinese and Western literature and was respected by the scholar community for decades of educational work. His family was poor and he had many children. Friends in Hong Kong held a memorial service in Hong Kong and provided financial assistance as an educational fund for his children. Now, his son has transported his remains to Shanghai and temporarily placed them in the Da'an Interment Center. A memorial service will be held at the Jingtu Nunnery on the 16th of this month. At that time, people in Shanghai who had known him will definitely go to mourn and express their condolences.</p>

<p>(2) Explaining Life from a Biological Perspective</p>
<p>A (Structure of Life) (Cells) From a morphological point of view, the characteristic of living things is that they are composed of cells. Cells are composed of protoplasm. The cell contains a nucleus and cytoplasm. Neither can continue to live without the other. The cytoplasm contains vacuoles and cell membranes. The composition of the nucleus is different from that of the cytoplasm and is called nucleoplasm. It contains nucleolus and other small particles that are aggregated together. (Tissues) Cells with the same function are called tissues. However, the structure of plants and animals is different. The surface of the animal body is surrounded by a membrane, not only those exposed to the outside, but also those hidden inside. Animals have muscles, which account for half of the tissue. Higher animals have nervous tissue, which allows external sensations to reach the activity of organs through the brain. Tissues that connect or fill tissues in the body are called connective tissues. Plant tissues are not as complex as animal tissues, and the structure of organs is also very simple. There are tissues such as division, protection, machinery, and wheel transportation. (Organs and Systems) The organs of higher animals are divided into nutrition, sensation, and reproduction. The systems are divided into the digestive system, circulatory system, etc., eight major systems. Plant organs include nutritional organs, such as digestion, circulation, respiration, excretion, etc., and reproductive organs.</p>
<p>B (Chemical Composition in Living Organisms) When living organisms are chemically analyzed, they are composed of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, calcium, magnesium, chlorine, and iodine. Most of them are transformed into complex compounds. There are five types formed, namely proteins, hydrocarbons, fats, water, and salts. The ratio of the weight of the elements that make up proteins is carbon 55, oxygen 21, nitrogen 16, hydrogen 7, and sulfur 1. There are also those containing phosphorus or iron. Hydrocarbons and fats are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but fats contain very little oxygen. Water and salts are also contained in the non-living world.</p>
<p>C (Metabolism) Among the various functions that characterize living things, metabolism is the most important. It takes in foreign objects into the body, and then excretes substances from the body to the outside world. Therefore, the chemical components that make up the living organism are constantly changing. The metabolism of plants has three characteristics: (1) taking in inorganic substances, (2) eating liquids, (3) absorbing carbon and exhaling gas, carrying out assimilation, and generally not destroying the original protoplasm. The characteristics of animal metabolism are eating organic matter and solids and liquids, absorbing oxygen and exhaling carbon, and the original protoplasm must be destroyed, transformed into urea and excreted. Human metabolism is also the same. Bacteria are very important in metabolism and can decompose the corpses of animals and plants into raw materials for living things. Nitrogen can promote the chemical reaction of a large amount of food, which is secreted from the body. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Katie</p>
<p>——I Learned a Lesson</p>
<p>The following is not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>A year ago, I was working in the sample room of a certain factory. The manager of the factory had a modern mindset, and he particularly emphasized the first line of defense in this business war—the sample room. Therefore, I worked very carefully, wanting to do the work perfectly and impeccably. A promising young person should create and maintain credibility in their work. I worked every day with this mindset.</p>
<p>One day, three men in nice suits came to the sample room, saying they had just arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and wanted to purchase some goods. I was initially suspicious because they didn't look like businessmen. I immediately replied that we already had an agent in Hong Kong. They then asked if it was a certain company in a certain building on a certain street? I no longer doubted them when I heard them speaking so knowledgeably. They wanted to come inside to look around, and I allowed it; and concentrated on entertaining these "distinguished customers."</p>
<p>After returning home, I suddenly felt that these three uninvited guests were a bit strange. If they had stolen something, wouldn't the credibility I had been trying so hard to maintain for so many days be completely ruined? Wouldn't the manager distrust me because I hadn't done my duty? I was worried and depressed, and couldn't sleep well that night.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up early and went to check the goods, but nothing was missing, and there were no errors in the inventory records. Only then was I relieved; I secretly laughed at myself for being neurotic and worrying unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Several months later, one day, two detectives from the police station suddenly barged into the sample room with a handcuffed thief, and asked me point-blank if I recognized this person. Recognize him? Of course! A short man with a dark complexion, one of the three uninvited guests! But I felt like I was dreaming, or like I had woken up from a dream. The situation was too strange and too sudden. It was like a bolt out of the blue, shattering my composed attitude. I felt like I had lost my balance, my heart was pounding, I was stunned, and couldn't say a word for a long time.</p>
<p>It turned out that this person had indeed stolen something from us several months ago. But what was stolen was something a Jewish customer had left with us. No wonder I couldn't find any shortages in the accounts or inventory.</p>
<p>Even though what was stolen wasn't ours, it caused an internal struggle within me. There were two paths in front of me; one was to truthfully report to the manager, which was the straight path. The other was to resolve it myself, which was the crooked path. At the time, the second path seemed like a clever way to protect my reputation. So I chose it.</p>
<p>From that day on, I began to use "self-protection" and "avoidance" mechanisms, not facing reality—evading and covering up. I spent a lot of effort living a small, dishonest life. After two or three months, the matter finally came to an end, the lost items were returned, and the court made its judgment: I thought everything had been resolved perfectly and that what I wanted to protect had been protected.</p>
<p>Who knew that two months later, the central police station would call me, because one of the thieves was a foreigner and would be tried by a consul, asking me to testify. Because of this phone call, the matter was exposed like white sand found in mud, due to people's curiosity. Even worse, the next day the police station, fearing that I would refuse to testify, went directly to see the manager, the worst scene I had imagined for months, the scene I least wanted to see, was finally staged in a grand manner, shattering the self I wanted to protect completely.</p>
<p>But not long after the matter, I felt that it was an extremely valuable lesson and experience. I remembered this saying in the Christian Bible: "There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known." Now this saying has become a part of my life. Humans are most likely unwilling to face reality, only wanting to maintain the status quo and themselves. Therefore, they are unwilling to be honest and open and want to hide and cover up, resulting in many unnecessary behavioral mechanisms, developing a distorted mentality, losing a free and happy heart, and wasting the power of positive progress. This is a great loss to individuals, families, countries, and society. But what is the result? Often, one cannot escape reality, so why not take the straightforward path? From then on, I took an honest and unreserved attitude towards everything; if I made a mistake, I immediately admitted it, and in this way, I was able to maintain my credibility and gain the manager's trust. Although I am sometimes still tempted not to take the straight path, when I think of this decisive experience, I muster the courage to step onto the straight path—the straight path is the shortest and easiest path to achieve the goal.</p>

<p>The clock tower of Liverpool Street Station in London was originally a building that stood high above the clouds, looking down on everything. Since German planes began flying over London day and night, to avoid serving as a bombing target and compass for German planes, the clock tower has returned to earth and changed its mission. The clock's machinery has been dismantled, and the empty face of the clock has become an information desk on the street. It is also an interesting wartime occurrence.</p>

<p>— Fei Le</p>
<p>Children, these little things! I really don't know how much energy it takes to deal with them!</p>
<p>I really thought that everything I spent on my children could have enabled me to accomplish a great career. But to this day, I haven't even gotten halfway through "Children's Homework"!</p>
<p>Children, the performance of their little "minds" is unimaginable: you intentionally want them to be lively in front of friends, but they are as dull as wooden chickens; they won't drink the best orange juice, they insist on buying candied haws; they fall off the high stool, but they still want to continue climbing up; they often get tangled up with the little boy who has scabies...</p>
<p>So, I get angry! I really want to learn a little "motherly education" and give my child a good beating!</p>
<p>But my clenched "old fist" always involuntarily relaxes, unwilling to touch my child's tender skin. Because I have already realized:</p>
<p>"Anger that goes beyond reason is not an expression of love."</p>
<p>I love my child, and I can't go against the principle of "love" when I hit him, so I have to filter out every drop of "anger."</p>
<p>I analyze the reasons why my child is acting up, how much of it is caused by myself? Starting a fire myself and then putting it out myself, many people habitually do this stupid thing to their children.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your child, he will have many unique "suggestions." Don't consider yourself 100% "correct" and reject all of his ideas. Just look at the seedling of this little thought, one day it will grow into a tree full of fruit, which will amaze you!</p>
<p>Children are always better than you, just as you think you are better than your mom.</p>
<p>Therefore, children are not toys, and children are not "punching bags." A smart mother knows how to nurture her children with multifaceted love!</p>
<p>There is a saying in the Bible that is given to every parent:</p>
<p>"Do not exasperate your children!"</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Thirteen Wandering to Shanghai</p>
<p>It wasn't until almost bedtime that Begonia thought of a personal problem that seemed like he should take this opportunity to ask Squad Leader Lu about.</p>
<p>"Do you think we can stay here any longer? Squad Leader," he asked in a very low voice, word by word.</p>
<p>"It's hard to say. If their iron cavalry arrives, then not only will you not be able to stay, but maybe you won't be able to plant anything in your fields!" This was the common view of Squad Leader Lu and the other two soldiers.</p>
<p>"Then what should we do?" Mei Bao couldn't help but frown.</p>
<p>"You can only go south early in the morning!" Another young soldier said, "If our people can all leave before they arrive, then even if they seize many cities, it won't do them any good!"</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, Mei Bao was already nodding repeatedly to her father.</p>
<p>"That's right, we should all leave!" That seemed to be what she meant.</p>
<p>But it was easy to say, but difficult to do. Although they had heard many terrible news in the past few days, and had even seen many retreating troops and refugees walking through the streets in groups; and even several families in the village had already moved, Begonia still wanted to struggle to survive. Mei Bao urged him several times, but he always said:</p>
<p>"Child, don't be impatient. When it really gets to the point where we can't stay any longer, will I still be afraid of leaving? The truth is that we are farmers, and we can't live without the land, so I want to endure for one more day if I can. " (1235)</p>

<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's Path to Fame (Part 1)</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu came south this time at the invitation of Huang Jin, and performed on October 1st. The theater was full every day, and it was not affected by the slightly higher price. His charm can be described as great. Now I will describe his path to fame to share with readers. It can be seen that all arts, if you want to reach the peak and be admired by the world, all come from hard work, not by luck. Yanqiu's original name was Yanqiu, courtesy name Yushuang. He was originally a member of the Qing royal family. After the Republic of China, his family declined, so he learned acting. He first studied under the female martial arts performer Rong Diexian. In the autumn of the eighth year of the Republic of China, he first appeared on stage at the Dan Gui Teahouse in Dong'an Market, performing the play "San Niang Teaches Her Son". In his childhood, he worked diligently to study opera day and night. His face was thin, his figure was slender, and his elegance overflowed from his eyes. He is not the 180-odd pound Cheng Yanqiu that we see today. Yanqiu's success was due to the introduction of Luo Yinggong, who apprenticed him to Mei Lanfang. This was a major turning point for Yanqiu. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Yanqiu represented his teacher Mr. Mei and went to the Gengsu Theater in Nantong to sing "Cosmic Front", which became a hit. He was appreciated by Mr. Zhang Jizhi and people in the south. Soon after, he was hired by a stage in Shanghai, and he created his own Cheng-style singing style outside of the Mei school. Once the foundation was established, it has expanded to this day. Mr. Yanqiu was not from a family of performers, and he was lonely and helpless. If he had not had famous teachers and friends to assist him, it is uncertain whether he would have achieved his current status.</p>
<p>Yanqiu's voice is clear, strong, bitter, and unique in tragic dramas, which is the opposite of Lanfang's charming and sweet voice, just like their names. Spring orchids and autumn frost have very different spirits given to them by heaven. However, there are also similarities among the differences: 1. Humility and courtesy, and willingness to learn; 2. Diligent study of the arts, and no laziness in their work; 3. Regular life, and self-discipline. Lanfang has the above three virtues, and Yanqiu also has them. It is difficult for other actors to have all of them.</p>

If the results are excellent, she may be able to work in drama troupes regularly. It is said that Jin Suqin, under the leadership of Ouyang Yuqian, performed in the China Improvement Drama Troupe's "New Yu Tang Chun," "The Peach Blossom Fan," etc., and already has a drama style. Jin Suwen played the role of Zhou Xiyi in "Thunderstorm" at the Carlton a few years ago and was praised as the only one after Zhao Huishan. This pair of sister flowers both have dramatic talent.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 18 Vowing to Sweep Away the Huns, Not Caring About Oneself</p>
<p>Since Sangui had sworn to lead his troops to suppress the bandits, he sent proclamations to Beijing, which naturally caused some shock among the rebel forces. Li Zicheng was furious when he saw that he could not persuade Sangui to surrender. Coincidentally, military advisor Niu Jinxing brought in Sangui's proclamation and read it to Li Zicheng. Li Zicheng was an illiterate warrior. He propped up his waist, raised his head, and sat箕踞, listening to Niu Jinxing read, "...Li Zicheng is a demon, a little clown, destroying the sacred capital, the sun is without light, the demonic aura is spitting flames, jackals and wolves rush into the city,允豕occupies the palace, killing my emperors and empresses, executing my scholars and gentlemen, slaughtering my people, plundering my property, the resentment of the ancestors; the desolate wind of the 神廟; the诛锄of the 元勋懿戚; the crying blood of the鬼門...." When he heard this, he stuck out his tongue and said, "This kid is scolding me so badly? It really makes me feel a little uneasy!" Niu Jinxing only continued to read, and at the end of the passage, "...The fate of the Zhou has not changed,淡　 can be思,诚志is trusted, obedience can overcome resistance, righteous troops are invincible. Think about the return of the 赤縣's heart, still the orthodoxy of the Zhu family...." Li Zicheng jumped up early and said, "Good boy! Is this world the Zhu family's or the Li family's? Does he want the Wu family to come out and interfere with me? Okay, let's see how many soldiers and horses this kid has, daring to send proclamations to suppress me, coming to move earth on my head. I will raise three armies and defeat that fellow first, and then go down to the south of the Yangtze River. What does the military advisor think?" Niu Jinxing said, "Wu Sangui is stationed outside the gate, and his reputation has long been established. Since he is unwilling to surrender and instead comes to attack us, he is indeed a hidden danger to us. While there is no movement in various places south of the Yangtze River, we should send troops eastward to defeat Wu Sangui. Then Yan Jing will be free from worries in the northeast, and then we can wholeheartedly recover the land to the south." (191)</p>
