<h3>傳美日同意防免戰爭　商就局部協定方案　赫爾再邀中英澳荷代表集議華盛頓柏林同時展開政治戰</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十五日紐約電　紐約泰晤士報駐華盛頓訪員來電稱、赫爾國務卿「昨與野村來栖長談之後、聞巳商就一種局部協定的方案、藉以緩和美日緊張關係、並阻戰事在太平洋爆發、其內容聞包含　日本放棄在南太平洋及西比利亞東部之領土願望、　日本自越南撤軍、俾解除民治國對泰國或荷印被侵之憂慮、同時目可减少緬甸公路被擊之危機、　美國將日本在美資金之一部份予以解凍、並局部取消商業限制辦法、　日本得向海外尤其是向越南及荷印、取給其所必需之原料云、</p>
<p>合衆社廿五日倫敦電　此間政治及外交觀察家咋更深信在華盛頓舉行之美日談判、目前集中於討論與日本成立」暫時妥協、彼等以為此暫時妥協之時期約一月、倘華盛頓談判成功、則締一「臨時協定」將為談判之先聲、以後則再依據九國公約而作更永久之處置、但專家估計即使有成立一臨時協定之可能、但此種機會亦僅屬「與」之比、若美國建議於妥協期中日本退出華南及越南、而日本亦不作南侵或北侵、此舉亦不足為奇、日本由越南撤退、則緬甸路可得安全、在此處之困難點即可消滅、同時、預料民主國或將對日本减去一部份之經濟制栽、日本方面或願撤退越南之南部日軍而移至越南之北、或更保證不作南侵、並信日方或將指出於四月間與斯達林簽訂之中立協定、巳可保證共不作北侵而不願再作新保證、日本或更要求恢復七月二十六日以前之日本與民主國之經濟關係、解凍一切日本之資金、取消英美所　之限制云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十五日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨午後四時（上海時間二十五日午前五時）召集中英澳荷四國代表在國務院集議、在目前美國對日本作「和戰談判」中、彼等之會晤、在三日中巳為第二次、赫爾於星期六夜曾與野村來栖作二小時之會晤、而外間謠言遂熾、謂談話有順利之進展、衆信赫爾將對最近一次之談話作有利之報告、因星期六會有官報、謂ABCD國家對談判正與美國保持密切之商討、而太平洋領導談話之責、則將由美國担任之也、赫爾氏在記者席上鄭重指出、至目前為止、談話僅以交換意見為限、尙未進入採取決定之時間、衆信民治國家前此之會議、已無異警吿日本、謂ABCD國家刻正聯合一致、以協調之齊整步驟對抗日本之進一步侵略、被邀出席者包括英大　哈里　克斯·中國大　胡適博士·荷公使勞　·及　公使，凱賽、</p>
<p>合衆社二十五日華盛頓電　英國大使哈里法克斯於會後告新聞界稱、除上星期六所發表ABCD各强國巳聯合一致支持美國在太平洋局勢中之立塲之聲明、此外渠無他語、或詢以渠是否尙樂觀、哈里法克斯稱、渠仍堅持其星期六之聲明、渠始終樂觀、嗣後國務院官員稱、「此為業巳舉行之討論之賡續、現正考慮再舉行一次或多次會議」、</p>
<p>路透社廿五日華盛頓電　最大政治戰爭之一、刻在華盛頓東京與柏林三陣地進行中、太平洋和戰問題顯將取決於此，就此間所可見者言之、德國反共會議旨在使日本證實其對於反共公約之道德上義務、德國在東京之外交家聞正不斷的努力、欲使日本對英美衝突、至於在華盛頓之政治上戰爭、則複雜更甚日本冀偵知美國是否徒作恫嚇言論、日本能否不參加大戰而有所獲、美國雖欲避免太平之衝突、然不願犧牲或損害許多年來支配其亞洲行動之政策與原則、赫爾與來梄之談話進展何似、官塲極守秘密、謠言乃紛起、傳說來梄迄未有何提議，但僅與赫商討論時局而欲確知美國之立塲、然後日內閣得決定其趨向，赫爾對於美日談話僅發寥寥數語、始終調整個事件猶在初步試探階段中、但謠言則謂、美國確巳向日本提出切實辦法矣、衆料星期六日與昨日召開之五强會議、乃事態已至嚴重階段之表微、且有人謂昨日午後國務院於最後一次美日談話後四十八小時、倐然召集中英澳荷四國代表之會議、殆為美國對日施用神經戰術、使日本不敢在柏林會議中過吿奪勇之解、美國誠甚欲銷滅太平洋戰事之可能性、但日本能否接受美國所必提出如撤退在華及亞洲他處日軍等之條件、則此間人士仍不能無欵、蓋日本撤兵等於在華失敗、日本國內　反響或不免嚴重也、日本領袖與報紙所發之崛强論調、迄未表示日本可對於美國根據九國公約下與大西洋憲章下道德地位所必提出之條件、有予以接受之可能或願意也、中英澳荷代表星期六日之會議、似甚美滿且意見一致、此種事實可視為美國熊度依然堅定之確證、美國對於經濟地位旣已危迫而對美開戰必歸失敗之日本、從不作毫非必要之綏靖提議、巳從可知巳、熟知東方情形之若干觀察家以為最大危險、厥為日本在其現有途中倒行逆施、寗願對美作自殺性質之戰爭，而不願蒙叛離軸心與撤退在華軍隊之羞耳、</p>
<p>東京方面發訓令談話將有新發展</p>
<p>海通社二十五日東京電　此間關係方面咋日宣稱、日本外務省又以關於日美談話之訓令一件、授諸美大使野村及特使來栖、此一訓令當可使談話獲有發展、但該令內容如何、則未經發表　政界人士則警吿不可因此一發展、而表示樂觀、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日東京電　此間消息靈通觀察家預料、美日關係中、不久將有新發展、因外相東鄕現與外務省高級人員畫夜開會硏究駐美日大使之報告也、彼等以為赫爾與中英澳荷四國代表之會議、巳使美日談話中發生新的難題、赫爾之召集ABCD會議不僅通吿美日談話之進行情形、且以此為制止日本之工具、誠　箭雙鵰之舉也、</p>
<p>日各報大肆咆哮責美施包圍策略</p>
<p>路透社二十五日東京電　今晨此間各報公然抨槃華盛頓之五强會議、都新聞稱為「討論法律之盜賊會議」、軍部機關國民新聞反對任何第三方面出而干涉、圖解決日美爭案、並主張如美國　　容許此類國家（中英荷）運用勢力、並堅持拒絕日本踐行其主義、則當宣布華盛頓談判之決裂、</p>
<p>合衆社二十五日東京電　日文報紙今日又攻擊美國、斥責其不顧華盛頓談話繼續其反日之包圍策略、「日日新聞」顯著刊載廣州之特訊、責美國以菲律賓為階石、「擬以援助中國為藉口、攫取中國及西南太平洋之覇權」「朝日新聞」登載消息稱、華方巳集中三十萬軍隊於中國西南以保衛滇緬公路、作為阻止日本結束中日戰事之措置、「日日新聞」又載斯丹埠之消息稱、新任駐美之蘇聯大使李維諾夫往華盛頓、其主要目的在於成立一美蘇互相協定、該電訊據謂得自美方稱、蘇聯提議予美國以海空根據地以遏阻日本、而置蘇日中立條約於不顧、又稱、此種建議之結果、蘇聯或將為對日包圍之一份子、</p>
<h3>泰國感戰爭威脅　召後備兵入伍　深信友邦必予援助</h3>
<p>合衆社　十五日曼谷電　曼谷官方無綫電本日稱、泰國政府巳進行準備應付大規模戰爭、無綫電稱、「泰國之被牽涉入太平洋戰爭、雖似無可避免、但仍有微弱之和平希望、如泰國政府被迫放棄其中立政策、則泰國將歡迎友邦之援助、友邦必樂於援助吾人者」云、無綫電並宣布、巳召集數級後備兵入伍、無綫電並向英美日呼籲避免太平洋戰爭、並要求民衆遵守政府嚴格中立之政策、</p>
<h3>英決出全力　為美後盾　特夫古柏之表示</h3>
<p>路透社廿五日威靈頓電　英戰爭內閣遠東代表特夫古柏咋夜在此述及美國被遺入太平洋戰爭時英國決為美國後盾事稱、英美兩國政府間有完全之瞭解而無秘密存在、英國在太平洋決以全力為美國後盾、邱吉爾君前巳言之矣云、古柏言及英國應委任常駐專員於太平洋區之建議、謂渠巳調查此問題、並巳報吿英政府、</p>

<p>傀儡展覽殊堪玩味</p>
<p>路透社二十五日倫敦電　今晨倫敦數大報均以希特勒反共「傀儡展覽」為題、著論批評、泰晤士報謂反共公約置於冷藏室中　閱多年、今復取出、該約當一九三九年或一九四○年週年紀念、曷為不予慶祝、其故顯而易見、無人發愚究問、希特勒就一九三九年之觀念欣然取銷該約、今當簽字五週年紀念日、又欣然使之復活、二者對照殊堪玩味、今簽　國之注重該約者、無一勝於德國、日本會一度注重、惟在當日彼尙未領略希特勒翻雲覆雨之奇才也、日人之意見、因　九三九年八月里賓特羅甫之鐵面無情為之恍悟、而因一九○一年六月希特勒背信行暴、更為震動、據現象觀之、召集此會議者、其心目中殊注意日本也、蓋近日日本之接近華盛頓、柏林對之殊　　口彭澤、而為惶惶不安、故欲令此軟膝合夥者重投其懷、則今日似屬適當其時、第日本政治家之未忘本年四月間松岡之簽定日蘇中立協定、乃出於希特勒陰謀之恿慫者、似不致為此種彰明較著之詭計所感動也、其他各報議論大致相同、據路透社外交肥者稱、希特勒原擬於十一月十七日在莫斯科召開新秩序大會、以慶祝蘇聯之失敗而　動和平攻勢、今見侵蘇一役師老無功、乃變更原計、而召集反共盟約簽字國開會於柏林、查第一次會議於一九三六年舉行、但在一九三九年德國轉向而與蘇聯締結互不侵犯公約、於是反共盟約遂被人置諾腦後矣、今五年期滿、德國外交復舊事重提、軸心國代表昨乃紛担柏林、其首先蒞臨者為義外相齊亞諾、未幾匈外長等相繼蒞會、西班牙與日本代表亦將參加、</p>
<p>蘇日協定依然有效</p>
<p>路透社廿五日東京電　此間官方意見、認為芬蘭等七國之繼續加入反共公約、對於日蘇中立協定並無影響、有以此點詢諸政府官吏者、則堅決答稱、此乃完全另一問題、並謂日本認日蘇中立協定仍屬有效云、</p>
<p>路透社二十五日東京電　今日情報局發表文吿云、日本政府認為反共公約之擴充及續有之七國之參加、殊有極重大意義、該約之六簽字國（德·義·日·滿·匈·西）巳同意將該約延展五年、繼續加入之七國、為南京政權·保加利亞·芬蘭·羅馬尼亞·丹麥斯洛伐克·及克羅特、查共產國際以其遍佈世界之組織、從事於共產性質之活動、可無待贅述、故防禦之範圍亦須普及於全世界、日本旣以建設東亞新秩序工作、為其國策之基礎、深覺對於共產黨之防禦、日增其必要、並認此次反共公約之繼續及繼續有七國之加入實堪慶祝云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>和平歟？戰爭歟？</h3>
<p>美日談判巳經進行了三個月，到底所談的內容如何，這是舉世所關心的一個疑問，祇有等待事實來解答。目前階段中値得我們記着的，却有三點：第一，美國國務卿赫爾曾正式聲明過，現在談判的性質是「試探」。第二，中英等國當局也一再正式聲明過，美日談判的詳情，他們是隨時得到通知與報吿的。第三，令人欣慰的，是前天赫爾與來栖，野村等會議後，立刻邀集了中，英，等國外交代表舉行會議。</p>
<p>還有一個比談判具體內容更重要的問題，就是：美日談判的前途，究竟如何？</p>
<p>假如說，現在放在日本面前急待牠解答的問題，已是和平與戰爭的話，那末，就種種客觀形勢看來，牠當前的處境，是和平非常為難，戰爭又十分危險，可是美國呢，戰則犧牲甚輕，和平也無往不利。這是當前遠東形勢中最根本的兩點，一面說明了日本當局近來的失措與倉皇：另一面也就說明了美國的從容與暇豫。在目前這兩種絕對相反的處鏡中，我們還發現不了自動的一致與和諧，或勉强的湊合與妥協。那末，這次美日談判的前途如何，也就不難想像了。</p>
<p>先由日本方面來看。造成牠當前這種徘徊和戰之間，舉棋不定的最大原因，當然，是德蘇大戰勝敗的未見分曉。如果德國能够擊潰蘇軍，或衝到高加索及中東，甚至於佔領了莫斯科與列寗格勒，那末，日本態度的決定。就是一個比較容易的工作。牠一方面可以向英美提出警吿與要求，以響應德義西方攻勢，發動北進最大的威脅，逼迫英美承認牠的「大束亞新秩序」；而另一面，萬一危機最後爆發，太平洋發生大戰的話，牠也還可以急速拚命冒險，一舉而企圖擊退蘇聯在遠東的軍力，解去了後顧之憂，再轉過身來，與英美從事太平洋上的角力，而以東三省，蘇聯濱海省及華北佔領區等地方，作為牠在大陸上的根據地。如果穗國的失敗形勢，巳經成了難以挽回的，固定事實的話，那末，東西兩紐「新秩序」企圖的完全幻滅，也就成了當然的結論。不過，當前德蘇的勝敗未定，却令牠十分為難。這時候，日本如果貿然對美挑釁，那末亳無疑義的，牠馬上就要陷入四面楚歌艱苦作戰的境地，而接下去，也許德國在西方遭到敗績，則日本那時所遇危機之大，眞恐怕是牠有史以來所未有過的了。然則，日本接受和平這條途徑麼？目前這條途徑的可能方式，僅僅祇有兩種，不是徹底屈服於正義力量之前，放棄「新秩序」的企圖，就是聽其自然，繼續目前這種拖延的局面。如屬前者，則日本幾十年來所抱的野心，就要宣吿永遠放棄；若為後者，則日本現在所受經濟封鎖壓力之嚴重，總有一天，使牠踏上不可收拾的途徑。總之，西方戰塲結果未明，實在是日本當前徬徨與苦悶的最大因素。恐怕日本沒有一個政治家，敢斷言德蘇戰爭的勝負。因此，也就沒有一個日本當政者，敢在這時貿然決定牠的根本國策，到底是接受和平還是從事戰爭。</p>
<p>換一個方向看，美國現在所處的環境，與日本比起來，却是一個非常觸目的對照。牠對日政策的根本方針，如果決定出以戰爭的話，那末，那個戰爭的意義，在牠，頂多不過是金錢的大量支出，與物資戰具大規模的出征而已。固然牠本國的天空·陸地·與海邊，不會成為戰塲，國民生活不致受到改變，卽使人員的出征，在中·英·蘇·荷等國一致對日作戰的形勢下，牠也可以降到最低限度的數目。何况在優劣形勢絕對懸殊中，牠幾乎有着十二分的致勝把握，而絲亳無庸顧慮這樣一個戰爭的前途。這與日本方面全國有化為戰塲可能，及大難臨頭的危懼心理，是根本不同的。反過來，如果美國決定對日的政策，仍循和平途徑的話，那末，不管是出以政治壓力方式，逼日本立刻屈服，或是出以暫時放任方式，讓目前這密雲不雨的局面再繼續拖延下去，在美國，却仍然握着最要緊的關鍵。出以第一個方式時，美國可以聯合遠東所有列强，發動一個對日的共可壓迫，使日本面對着壓倒的優勢，不得不卽行屈服。出以第二方式時，美國一方面有着經濟制裁，對日最致命的手段，使牠現在資源慢慢耗竭，而逐漸達到山窮水盡的境地；而同時，美國加緊援助英·蘇，促成德·義失敗，再加上支持中國奮戰，提早實現總反攻的到來。一到德·義崩潰後，遠柬的形勢，一定也就要迎刃而解，何况那時中國再舉行決定生的反攻！總之，在美國旣定的國策下，無論是和平或是戰爭，牠都有着非常寬裕的運用餘地，而尤其要緊的，牠的對日致勝可能，現在幾乎兩方面同樣的都是百分之百。所以，美國駐遠東陸戰隊的徹退，已經表示了牠在預防日本的任何挑戰，準備打仗：而後來日本來栖特使到達華盛頓後，美國仍舊接受了日本請求，和他再開談判，這又表示了，美國確實有着充分自信，而並不懼怕循和平途徑，以達到牠自己的目標。</p>
<p>不過，深一層看，國際上其他種種因素的作用與推動，却使日·美兩國本身的環境及態度，都趨向於比較複雜的狀態。此地値得特別指陳的，有兩點：第一，英·蘇對德·義反攻的問題，使他們除了要求美國大量物質援助外，還時時期待美國人力的參加，而英國這一個要求，尤其來得顯明而急迫。在美國參加反攻時，牠的第一步，當然是先解決東方的不安勢力。第二德·義所處的困境，也使牠們時時要求日本趕緊在東方響應，襲擊英·蘇的後方。日本如果企圖利用將來德。義戰勝時的成果，不自動退出三國同盟的話，那末，牠勢必須順從德·義的要求，在適當的時機，以行動與牠們呼應。</p>
<p>最後，照形勢推測起來，在明年春季前，無論英·蘇對美國的參加要求，或德·義對日本的響應催逼，都不會達到決定的階段，而在這以前，美·日的和戰問題，似乎也就不至臨到最後的關口。</p>

<p>昨晚本埠美海軍權戚方面透露、美國駐華揚子江艦隊、巳接到華盛頓海軍部命令、將所屬江防砲艦撤退一部、撤退之隻數、猶未完全決定、撤往之地點、當與第四聯隊相同為馬尼刺、該一命令、由美亞洲艦隊總司令赫德上將發來、揚子江艦隊司令曾由葛拉斯福少將接到命令以後、即統飭所屬各砲艦候令、查揚子江艦隊屬美亞洲艦隊、歸美國遠東第十六區海軍區司令倍米期少將統轄、該隊現有砲艦五艘、計呂宋號（五七五）噸·沃湖號（四五零噸）·韋克號（三二七零噸）·圖圖於號（三七零噸）·及明達諾號）圖圖於號現泊重慶、明達諾號巡弋華南洋面、呂宋號駐滬、為該艦隊旗艦、</p>
<p>减少艦數並非全撤</p>
<p>國際社華盛頓廿五日電、海軍部昨日宣稱、服務於長江巡邏隊之美砲艦七艘、其中數艘、即將撤退、海部並未宣布撤退船隻之確切數目、及其目的地、本週週末、將有總統輪船公司之撤退船隻兩艘、載運美海軍陸戰隊第四聯隊、自上海駛往馬尼刺、故衆信此項美砲艦、將繼此兩船之後、開赴菲島、自羅斯福總統宣布渠決意將海軍陸戰隊、撤離中國以後、衆認美長江砲艦之撤退、將為必然之結果、故海部此項通吿、自無庸驚奇、又據美國合衆社華盛頓廿五日電、海軍部某官員昨日宣布、在格拉斯福少將統領下之揚子江巡邏隊之若干美國軍艦、將行撤退、海軍部某發言人於答客問時吿合衆社稱、「海軍部現减少揚子江巡邏隊之軍艦數目、然非完全離開」、該發言人未言此等撤退軍艦將何往、與奉命留守揚子江之巡邏軍艦之正確數目、衆信此項命令、不致影響現駐重慶之「都都意拉」號、及現在華南遊弋之「明奴號」</p>
<p>沃湖韋克兩艦先行</p>
<p>雖美海軍部僅聲稱將撤退揚子江艦隊之一部、而不及其數量、惟據消息靈通人士昨日表示、圖圖拉號及明達諾兩艘、將仍在原地巡泊、可能於相當時期內撤退者、為沃湖及韋克兩艘、前者原泊蕪湖、巳於二十三日駛抵滬、後者泊漢口、亦巳於昨日離漢來滬、上有士兵卅名、官長六人、艦長為哈立斯、據悉章克號可望於二日內抵此、然後會同撤退、屆時美海軍購料處人員、或將分乘該兩艦離滬、其目的地當為亞洲艦隊目下集中地之馬尼刺、</p>
<p>葛拉斯福坐鎭上海</p>
<p>揚子江艦隊中圖圖拉號駐泊重慶不能撤、明達諾號巡弋華南不致撤、故該艦隊實際上藉口呂宋·沃湖·韋克·三艘、美海軍部旣稱局部撤退、斷無令該三輪完全離華之理、今沃湖·韋克兩艦均巳先後離開原防地來滬候令撤退、則呂宋號按理自應駐在上海、此點巳由美海軍權威方面證實、故葛拉斯福少將當坐鎭滬上、非至太平洋上有事時、決不撤退、昨日外人方面曾表示、美呂宋艦將留至最後撤退、如有必要、當載滬美政府官員離滬、查呂宋艦艦長為勃羅克、全艦士兵七十人、官員連葛拉斯福少將之幕僚在內、計廿四人、</p>
<p>撤退準備早已完民</p>
<p>又據另一消息、美國揚子江艦隊係屬亞洲艦隊之一部份、亞洲艦隊總司令赫德上將、於本月中旬、即已命令葛拉斯福少將作撤退準備、葛氏於奉令後、於本月下旬中即完成必要準備、俟正式命令到達後、即行撤退、又悉沃湖及韋克兩艦、將於本星期日左右護送第四聯隊第一大隊乘哈立遜總統號、同行赴菲、</p>
<p>首批美軍緩期離滬</p>
<p>據咋晚所得可靠消息，駐滬美海軍第四聯隊第二大隊、原定今晨乘麥迪遜輪離滬、現以該輪奉美當局命、須將所有房艙改為統艙、俾每一美軍、置一行軍牀以適應軍隊生活、故須展期、至第一大隊、則於三十日乘哈立遜輪離滬、並無變更、「送別播音」決於是日上午十時十五分、在新關碼頭舉行、由花旗銀行總經理麥凱任報吿員、除該聯隊司令霍華德上校與揚子江艦隊司令葛拉斯福少將均將致辭外、並將隨時邀該隊官兵、作簡短之談話、該隊以離滬在即、須將營底裝船、故連日該隊摩托運輸隊工作甚為忙碌、聞英僑協會美國商務部代表、巳定今日下午六時至八時、在哥侖比亞路鄕下總會、聯合為霍華德司令及其他官佐餞行、必有一番盛况、據前晚參加美國總會公宴之美陸戰隊官員談、是晚為彼等在滬所參加之最好一次宴會、因此對於滬市益感依依不捨、以參加在宴會中、無不歡娛非凡也、</p>
<h3>英撤僑輪明生號　定期解纜南駛</h3>
<p>並有先駛烟台載僑之說</p>

<h3>日方擬派專輪撤退南洋日僑</h3>
<p>指定十輪分途出發本月杪下月初成行</p>

<p>指定船名</p>
<p>日政府有鑒於此、乃與各該國涉、惟各該國均無便船可供日僑乘坐撤退之用、最近各地日僑希望返國者、人數較前又形激增、故外務省即與各關係方面協議結果、決由日方自行派輪前往各處、供日僑搭乘返國、將於本月內及下月間、派龍田丸·冰川丸·及大洋丸前往夏威夷、日枝丸赴印度洋、扶桑丸淺間丸·箱根丸·赴海峽殖民地及菲島等處、高千穗丸·日昌丸·及富士丸·赴荷屬東印度、各該輪刻下均在返日途中、對於美國及巴拿馬方面、亦正考慮令龍田丸前往、</p>
<p>撤橋人數</p>
<p>大約各處歸國之日僑、將超過一萬名、對於彼等、返國後之就業問題，關係各省正在斡旋中、並硏究保護救濟辦法、外務省並決定於各地日僑撤退返國抵神戶實濱時、派員前往會同當地官員協力照料、予以一切便利、對於川資缺乏或無款項者、所有一切食宿及返鄕費用、均由日當局擔負、以期保護周密、</p>

<h3>金價五日跌五千元　日跌千元距最高價已小去萬元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、空前跌風雖未息、巳轉呈徘徊局勢、一萬四千元大關兩度敲破後即見回出、各方人心由疲已轉定、乃揚子江美艦已撤退、而美日有局部協定傳說之故、故證券幫出籠一千兩、順源·義豐·成記各軋出四五百兩、一度由一萬五千三百五十元狂退至一萬三千四百元、午刻謠傳利買、且香港潮州等幫補空、明豐進五百餘兩、時和·祥興永·祥和·同康、永及銀行幫委證券幫之各進三百兩左右、後起落在一萬四千元左右、終尙軋小四百七十元、全日交易二萬四千兩光景、</p>
<p>現金上落近二千元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點開市為一萬五千一百元、比上日晚收價高一百五十元、時和·新豐永·滙票商來進抬、哄升至三百五十元、不久順源等突來傾出、竟被賣小一千元、跌至一萬四千三百五十元、祥興永明豐滙票商進提升五百元、達一萬四千八百五十元、揚子江　艦撤退訊、賣風又起、滙票商復出、順源立泰大量力售、跌風加厲、再狂瀉一千四百五十元、降至一萬三千四百元、午刻傳美日侷步妥協、市氣轉堅、祥興永天元買進、遂起回風、步升九百五十元、午收升至一萬四千三百五十元、下午二點開市、即在抬風中上升四百五十元、為一萬四千八百元、公和德成進、升至一萬四千九百五十元、復又下挫、天元公和來力售、傾瀉一千二百元、遜至一萬三千七百五十元、終見明豐及滙票商力進、抬上七百三十元、四點收市一萬四千四百八十元、比上日再軋小四百七十元、巳連小五天之久、共跌五千零五十元、當日有一千九百五十元差度、收後升至一萬四千八百元、金號牌金、門市售價一萬五千元、售出低一千元、</p>
<p>飾金紋銀兌價均跌</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行初見掛小三次、跌一百三十元、有一千四百元、午刻回升七十元、下午又升五十元、達一千五百二十元、忽跌至一千四百五十元、又回升三次漲五十元、計一千五百元、（收進减一百五十元）尙軋小三十元、紋銀低二元、為二十二元、黑市小一元、計十七元云、</p>
<h3>黑匯猛鬆　美鈔曾到廿六元</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、中央及匯豐兩掛牌勿更、英美等十四家外銀行小櫃　價穩定、英美滙黑黑市先猛鬆後稍回、乃初聞揚子江美艦隊撤退、後傳美日間局部妥協所致、晨開後現金狂瀉、美票跌至二十五六元、投機家所餘多頭求脫、勢見驟鬆、東方滙理銀行售予法商進口洋行美金五六千元　價為三元七五、後更硬至照上價無結者、英滙二辦士四三七五有賣戶、午刻止鬆稍回、下午雖未續成交、略帶軟化、收市英滙二辦士三七五、美滙三元六二五、比前日英長一二五、美長二五、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金磅各跌十元、英金票漸趨平穩、美金票一度退至二十六元、最後為二十七元二角、比上日仍軋跌一元九角、香港票跌後回平、日金票及朝鮮票均趨低落、前者退為二元七角、後者降至二元九角、</p>

<p>香港二十五日（週二）電、　今晨滙市開盤平穩、買賣各滙仍無榮辱、</p>

<p>本市銀錢業有於十月份起、增加欠息二元、即以為津貼職工之用、惟尙未證實、</p>
<h3>時局轉移　外債飛升　統丁一枝獨秀</h3>
<p>倫倫二十　日（週一）電、　今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、中國債票均吿提升、前檔之英德續借款（英發）及費克斯飛機借款各升三鎊、前者為五十鎊、後者為十四鎊、克利斯浦借款升二鎊半、價為三十二鎊、英法借款（英發及善後借款（英發）各升二鎊、前者為四十八鎊、後者為卅八鎊半、後檔鐵路公債北寗猛升五鎊、為七十鎊、道淸升四鎊、為十七鎊、湖廣非德發升三鎊、為十八鎊、京滬升一鎊、亦為十八鎊、其餘各升二鎊、均為十五鎊、英商股票、銀行股多呈起色、計麥加利升二先令六便士、價為九鎊七先令六便士、匯豐英倫註冊股升三鎊、價為八十鎊、又香港註册股升一鎊、價為八十六鎊、有利亦升二先令六便士、價為十二鎊十二先令六便士、祇開半煤礦股獨跌六便士、價為十三先令六便士、餘無變動、</p>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市稍形不振、各種行市始終未能穿出隔日收槃價、下午反打破七十元、謠言　雜、大都利空、多頭紛紛出籠、亦有由多翻空者、一般浮多顯有不願爭持之象、惟丁種一枝獨秀、此為投機性較少之故、暫時或將先小後大、總之仍以美日談判為依歸、昨日上午丙毬開盤為匕十元零六角、此後即逐步緩緩趨疲、同益仁豐多頭出籠、久豐亦有賣出、同康易中稍有補進午收略小二三角、午後同益機續賣出、恒康鼎康生大均紛紛出籠、生興似巳由多翻空、怡泰亦有賣出、市塲賣氣乃重、丙種打破七十元、見六十九元七角半小價、久豐補回、聯和聯益及協興元稍有買進、復又回上至七十元外、收槃市價結果、除丁種尙好起三角外、其他各種均小三角至六角半不等、成交約一百五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交中國國貨公司股一百股、價為每股七十五元、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市動盪不定、全日波浪殊大、晨初一度頗現穩勢、嗣即逐向下游、午收略又回上、下午走勢、與晨間相仿、初漲繼跌、收槃時又吿部份恢復、結果各股價格雖較前收退去不少、人心一時尙無任何恐慌跡象、</p>
<h3>金價倐上倐落　雙馬紗跟之團團轉</h3>
<p>近來紗市、忽升忽降、上下範圍浩大、此因黃金變遷殊汹、兼之美日談判迷離撲朔、足使投機人心不定、紗市隨之、波濤駭浪、但實際交易、當然自被禁以來、出路杜絕、然廠方因原料來源閉塞、生產勢必减縮也、二十支雙馬最高價為二千五百六十五元、低價為二千三百八十元、午後開槃隨余價狂跳、為二千五百六十元、高槃一見、引起獲利人吐出、又鬆至二千四百四十元、但有大戶購進、漸漸回昂至二千五百二十五元、收盤價為一千五百十五元、塲價為二千五百廿元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市態安定、首盤價二千五百三十元、少頃升至二千五百六十五元、但檯面上價高稍有賣出、在此二千五百二三十元之間、廻旋時候頗久、不料黃金風波驟起、跌風狂熾、人心牽入漩渦、賣氣濃烈、謂和平空氣極盛、空頭大為活躍、市盤步開步瀉直鬆至二千三白八十元低峰、迨至十二時將近、黃全突轉昂、紗市買風隨之而起、漸漸而漲至二千四百九十元收槃、查半日間成交統計三千四百包、今日有日紗六十件轉天津、</p>
<p>金　馬期貨市况、於動盪小定之局勢下、走勢依然下墮、且以消　之錯綜、一般人心無論多空、均無久持之力、尤以賣方潛力、每逢走勢一軟、即見大事傾塞、是以市氣大有易跌難漲之象、晨初　出、先以廠單堅漲、期紗隨之上游買氣一時極旺、十二月份做開為一五八〇元、軋大八十元、旋以謠傳蠭起、多屬利空、多方浮動、期紗急轉直下、近期一度軋低至二四·一〇元、一月份亦小至二四一五元、二月份亦降至二四八○元、迨至午收漸轉上升、各月期僅小三五十元、午後依然先堅後疲、形勢較為穩定、乃經浮空與散戶之買進、十二月份做至二四七〇元收盤、下跌三十元、一月份二五二五元、軋小三十五元、二月份二五七〇元亦小四十五元、</p>
<h3>棉市停頓</h3>
<p>現棉情况被流言所阻、交易入於停頓之途、此因標金及紗價一再趨降、加之廠方沉靜不動、祇得仍抱觀望、是以雖略有存意賤售者、而問津乏主、故全日交易未聞一票做開也、微聞細絨尙不肯大落，惟組絨價巳較遜矣、</p>
<h3>東疋實銷無望</h3>
<p>東布　取引所彩球期布晨市平穩、後市韓跌、十二月份收盤價八十六元五角、較跌一元九角九分、一月份收槃八十九元、跌二元五角、而現貨市塲則因實銷無望、賣氣愈鬆、龍頭細布廠單晨開九十三四元、一路下瀉至午收盤為八十九元、後市聞紗價上騰、回升至九十一元收盤、但較前日巳軋跌三元五角、四君子嗶嘰於三元四角開盤、跌至三元二角四分、末盤價為三元三角三分、</p>
<h3>洋粉食油　均圖脫售　雜糧市塲被改組</h3>
<p>洋粉早市進出兩稀、且承前晚疲風與米市影響、獲利浮戶均圖脫手、東棧轉口粉因客團納胃不濃、乃見正式降開四十八元、後有實銷趁平問津、加起半元為四十八元半、西棧有本街實銷顧問、亦自三十七元至三十八元、市面均轉平定之象、麩皮小麥亦乏出入、今日有麵粉九千五百包裝新北京輪述往天津、</p>
<p>雜糧油餅市塲巳於咋日下午由改組之雜糧公會接收、故僅祇上午交易、午後殊鮮做開、食油行情因散囤吐售復殷、而見下跌五元至十元、費豆亦受貨中鬆售見降三四元、苞米尙稱平穩、統市售開大連豆油三十桶、大有廠淸油三百担、又菜油一百担、泰山廠菜油一百担、日華廠菜油七十桶、天津金元六百餘包、又靑豆二百包、苞米現貨五百包、期貨一百多噸、到貨則法公司洛斯號前日抵滬、由海防運來苞米一千六百三十四噸、計一萬六千五百包、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>洋米旣無市面、國米亦因有限價一百五十元之說、進戶觀望不前、市面亦復完全停頓、</p>
<h3>期糖一日之間　跌停板與漲停板</h3>
<p>昨糖市初因和平空氣及現金棉紗步降而跌、故期現粗白一致跌入二百元大關、期粗目因跌停板、及至午後忽傳荷蘭船有减少來遠東之說、價乃回振、前後上落最高曾達三十餘元、可見起伏相差之甚、公司期粗本月底期上午跌至一百八十七元、下月十日期一百九十九元、均告停板、暗槃為一百七十七元至一百八十七元、下午因有荷輪减少至遠東之說、本月底期遂一漲而至一百九十元及一百○七元、又吿漲停板、十二月十日期下午初為一百八十七元、旋升至二百十四元至十九元、亦然停板、後暗盤一為二百元至一百九十三尤、一為二百十元、現貨二四粗白十一月份入口上午二百○九元、二百元、一百九十元、下午一百九十六元、二百〇九元、六元、十月份貨二百○八元、二百元、一百八十九元、下午一百九十五元、</p>

<h3>女職員問題</h3>
<p>— 平野</p>
<p>關於郵局停川女職員事，斷續的消息，巳經刋載了快一年了，因為關河的間阻，到今天我們還是慚愧着未能完全明瞭此舉的眞正原因，當停止考試任用女職員的時候，女界曾請郵政總局說明原委，郵政總局有過一個表示，說是巳婚女職員不便跋涉山川，所以停止考用（大意如此，未見其原文），到最近國民參政會開會，有如下一個消息；「女參政員陳逸雲提出郵局何以排斥女職員及停用巳婚女職員之質詢，幷謂此舉與增加人口之意義不合，孔庚亦謂如果停用已婚女職員，有違人道，事實上只能限制女職員結婚，不能限制女職員戀愛，應請補救」，陳孔兩氏的話，針對現實，自有共見地，率直道來，也有其事實。</p>
<p>以男子來談女子權益，同於女子來談男子權益，如果不為對方權益着想，還是緘口，自由以不侵犯他人之自由為自由，平等不侵犯他人平等為平等，我不想說什麽這件問題的是非，我只願檢討這一問題的原因所在，至於結論，等待着時代來做他的公平判決！</p>
<p>郵局所說的已婚女職員不勝跋涉，或許不是僅指體格而言，因為體格必須檢騐的，我想他所指的諒係已婚女職員如果懷孕，當有不勝跋涉之苦，這一句話，在零簡斷篇的消息中，未曾見到，我只是想當然耳，假如果屬這一意義，我是承認他有其困難，但這是偶然，至少局方的解釋，嫌其不够。</p>
<p>至於女界方面，力爭平等，自無可非議，但巳婚女職員如能對於局方的調遺，絕對沒有問題，當然最好，否則便應設法解決局方這種事實方面的困難。</p>
<p>我們在過去也見過女職員在任何公共機關服務，有成續不惡者，也難免有「花瓶」之稱老，可是在大時代裏，女界的奮勇，有其特異的表現，這種「花瓶」的過去想像，應該拋諸雲外，女界為爭眞正的男女平等，應該是以知識平等，敎育平等來求服務平等，待遇平等。</p>
<p>郵局未必永久拒用已婚女職員，巳婚女職員未必以郵局考用與否為榮辱。况且郵局停用巳婚女職員並不是男女平等的根本問題，而只是暫時的一種事實上問題，我們期待早日解決。</p>
<h3>擴大管制物價聲中　切望制裁「屋蠧」之橫行</h3>
<p>— 曹文海</p>
<p>今兩租界當局旣具貫澈其抑平物價政策之決心，固不以目前所做到者為巳足。滬地數百萬市民，對於「居住」問題，亦切望當局，秉保護布民維持治安之原則，予市民以全力之援助，限令「屋蠧」（大房東及二房東）自動减低租金。</p>
<p>大房東變本加厲壓迫承租筆者摯友趙君，於戰前租賃法租界茄勒路陳舊之雙幢住宅一所，「屋蠧」係一營造業起家之甬人，斯時雙方談妥，每月租金為七十元，房屋損壞，由房主修理，遷居後初一二年，曾修理一次，迨至八一三戰後，翌年夏間，屋面又損壞漏雨，墻壁亦有數處將倒塌，發信與房主，要求修理，竟置之不答，非但不飭水匠修砌，至上一月中，突接律師信要按月酌加三成，若不允照加，限於本年底解約遷讓，時趙君無法爭辯，只得照加，詎加租金後，房屋損漏，仍不飭匠修埋，且不三月，於　十八年　月初，又接經租帳房的信，要求增加水費，每幢那十二元，嗣後接二連三來信，非加租金，即加水費，甚至停止供給用水，逼迫租戶自裝水表，自負水費，經數度交涉而罷，而至今年初春，因屋面損壞過巨，遂通知房主，飭匠修屋，由經租帳房答復信謂，一切修理，歸租戶自理云。詎於六月中旬經租帳房又來信云：「本市地價，日見高漲，附屬於租賃物之一切費用，及各項捐稅亦無不　再增加，祗得自七月一日起，酌加租金五成，自來水每月每幢加徵十元。並另註「水費部份如貴房客於十日前置之不理，則帳房對於以後水費不再代付，屆時遇有斷水其他事故，敝處概不負責」云云，大房東之壓迫租戶，變本加厲至此巳極，滬地數百萬市民，恐非趙君一人吧。</p>
<p>二房東趁火打刦煎熬分租滬地市民，專　房屋為生者，不知凡幾，時値非當，剝削分租者（即　房客）不遺餘力，　前承租幢房屋，單幢者四五十元，雙幢租金亦僅六七十元，分間搭閣，形似鴿籠，分租與三房客，廂房租金一百二十元，客堂樓八九十元，亭子間四五十元，二層閣，三層閣，灶披間，總訂四百元左右，客堂晒台亭子間等自用外，每月房租房捐　燈水費開支百元左右，尙可凈賺二百餘元，坐收漁利，絕不費力。若遇大房東加租之事，譬如加一成，「屋蠧」則向」「房　客加」成三成，縱然心平者，亦加一成，然大房東之加一成祗七元，二房東加「房客之」成，豈非三四十元乎。更有水電捐費　增加，「二屋蠧」則乘意濫加無形中又增一筆額外之收入。如三房客付不出巨數租金而遭逼遷者，則不勝枚舉。更有一般狡獪之「屋蠧」以房屋為敲詐之工具，遍貼招租出頂之紅字條於弄口，引覓屋者之人彀，預先須付定洋一半或二三成，後再談租屋條規，如不台意，則定洋沒收，若就經交涉而歸還者，亦祗還三四成耳。</p>
<p>四五年　，上海「屋蠧」之橫微暴戾，煎熬同胞，不亞於「米虎」，是可忍，孰不可忍，切望兩租界當局，拯水深火熱之「房客，以登袵席，實刻不容綏。但筆者亦須諄勸為」房客者，滬地五方離處，良莠不齊，「二房東」決非一概不法之徒，事須公道論述，然三房客中亦有過份者，如故意欠租，通宵開燈，私燙衣裳，一巾洗滌數盆淸水等，都須改善也。（編者按：欠租事現極少。多數」房東晚上關電燈總門，此於防盜賊水火，極有危礙，希當局萬千注意。）</p>

<h3>Report: US and Japan Agree to Prevent War; Discussing a Partial Agreement Plan; Hull Re-invites Representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands for Discussions; Washington and Berlin Simultaneously Engage in Political Warfare</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, New York, 25th – A correspondent for the New York Times in Washington reports that Secretary of State Hull, "after a long conversation yesterday with Nomura and Kurusu, is said to have discussed a partial agreement plan to ease US-Japan tensions and prevent war from breaking out in the Pacific. The content is said to include: Japan abandoning its territorial aspirations in the South Pacific and eastern Siberia; Japan withdrawing its troops from Vietnam to alleviate the concerns of democratic countries about the invasion of Thailand or the Dutch East Indies, while also reducing the risk of attacks on the Burma Road; the United States unfreezing a portion of Japan's funds in the US and partially lifting commercial restrictions; Japan being able to obtain necessary raw materials from overseas, especially from Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies."</p>
<p>United Press, London, 25th – Political and diplomatic observers here are increasingly convinced that the US-Japan negotiations in Washington are currently focused on discussing a "temporary compromise" with Japan. They believe that this temporary compromise would last about a month. If the Washington negotiations succeed, then concluding a "temporary agreement" will be the prelude to negotiations, followed by more permanent arrangements based on the Nine-Power Treaty. However, experts estimate that even if there is a possibility of reaching a temporary agreement, the chances are only "fifty-fifty." It would not be surprising if the United States suggested that Japan withdraw from South China and Vietnam during the compromise period, and that Japan would not engage in southward or northward aggression. If Japan withdraws from Vietnam, the Burma Road would be safe, and the difficulties there would be eliminated. At the same time, it is expected that democratic countries may reduce some of their economic sanctions against Japan. Japan may be willing to withdraw its troops from southern Vietnam and move them to northern Vietnam, or even guarantee not to engage in southward aggression. It is believed that Japan may point to the neutrality pact signed with Stalin in April, which already guarantees non-aggression to the north, and may not be willing to make new guarantees. Japan may also demand the restoration of economic relations with democratic countries as they were before July 26, the unfreezing of all Japanese funds, and the removal of restrictions imposed by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 25th – Secretary of State Hull summoned representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands to the State Department yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM (5:00 AM Shanghai time). This meeting, during the current US "peace or war negotiations" with Japan, was their second in three days. Hull had a two-hour meeting with Nomura and Kurusu on Saturday night, and rumors have been rife that the talks are progressing smoothly. It is widely believed that Hull will give a favorable report on the latest round of talks, as an official announcement was made on Saturday stating that the ABCD powers are maintaining close consultation with the United States on the negotiations, and that the United States will take the lead in the Pacific talks. In the press room, Hull solemnly pointed out that, so far, the talks have been limited to exchanging opinions and have not yet entered the stage of making decisions. It is widely believed that the previous meeting of democratic countries was tantamount to warning Japan that the ABCD powers are currently united in a coordinated and unified manner to counter Japan's further aggression. Those invited to attend included British Ambassador Halifax, Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih, Dutch Minister Loudon, and Australian Minister Casey.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 25th – British Ambassador Halifax told the press after the meeting that, apart from the statement issued last Saturday that the ABCD powers are united in supporting the US stance in the Pacific situation, he had nothing else to say. When asked if he was still optimistic, Halifax said that he still stood by his Saturday statement and remained optimistic. Later, a State Department official said, "This is a continuation of discussions that have already taken place, and further meetings are being considered."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th – One of the largest political wars is currently being waged on three fronts: Washington, Tokyo, and Berlin. The issue of peace or war in the Pacific will apparently depend on this. As far as can be seen from here, the German anti-communist conference aims to have Japan reaffirm its moral obligations under the anti-Comintern Pact. German diplomats in Tokyo are reportedly constantly trying to get Japan to clash with Britain and the United States. The political war in Washington is even more complex. Japan hopes to find out whether the United States is merely making threatening statements and whether Japan can gain something without participating in the war. Although the United States wants to avoid conflict in the Pacific, it is unwilling to sacrifice or compromise the policies and principles that have governed its actions in Asia for many years. How the talks between Hull and Kurusu are progressing is being kept highly secret by officials, and rumors are rife that Kurusu has not yet made any proposals but is only discussing the situation with Hull and seeking to ascertain the US position, after which the Japanese cabinet will decide its course. Hull has only issued a few words about the US-Japan talks, constantly adjusting the situation, which is still in the preliminary exploratory stage. However, rumors say that the United States has indeed put forward concrete measures to Japan. It is expected that the five-power meetings convened on Saturday, Sunday, and yesterday are a sign that the situation has reached a critical stage. Some say that the sudden convening of the meeting of representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands by the State Department yesterday afternoon, forty-eight hours after the last US-Japan talks, is a kind of psychological warfare by the United States against Japan, to prevent Japan from boasting too much at the Berlin conference. The United States sincerely wants to eliminate the possibility of war in the Pacific, but local people still cannot help but have doubts about whether Japan can accept the conditions that the United States will inevitably put forward, such as the withdrawal of Japanese troops in China and elsewhere in Asia. After all, Japan's withdrawal of troops is tantamount to failure in China, and the domestic repercussions in Japan may be serious. The vigorous arguments made by Japanese leaders and newspapers have not yet indicated that Japan can or is willing to accept the conditions that the United States will inevitably put forward based on its moral position under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Atlantic Charter. The meetings of representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands on Saturday and Sunday seem to have been very satisfactory and unanimous in their opinions. This fact can be seen as a confirmation of the steadfastness of the US attitude. The United States has never made any unnecessary appeasement proposals to Japan, whose economic situation is already precarious and whose war against the United States will inevitably lead to failure. Some observers familiar with the situation in the East believe that the greatest danger is that Japan will go against its own interests on its current path, preferring to wage a suicidal war against the United States rather than suffer the shame of betraying the Axis powers and withdrawing its troops in China.</p>
<p>Tokyo Issues Instructions: Talks Will Have New Developments</p>
<p>Haito Agency, Tokyo, 25th – Sources here claimed yesterday that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued another instruction regarding the US-Japan talks to US Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu. This instruction should allow the talks to make progress, but the content of the instruction has not been released. Political figures warned against expressing optimism because of this development.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Well-informed observers here expect new developments in US-Japan relations soon, as Foreign Minister Togo is currently holding meetings day and night with senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study the reports from the Japanese ambassador to the United States. They believe that Hull's meeting with representatives from China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands has created new difficulties in the US-Japan talks. Hull's convening of the ABCD meeting not only informed them of the progress of the US-Japan talks but also used this as a tool to restrain Japan, truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Launch Fierce Tirade, Accusing the US of Implementing Encirclement Tactics</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – This morning, local newspapers openly criticized the five-power conference in Washington. Miyako Shimbun called it a "conference of thieves discussing law." The military newspaper Kokumin Shimbun opposed any third party intervening in resolving the US-Japan dispute and argued that if the United States allows such countries (China, Britain, and the Netherlands) to exert influence and insists on refusing Japan to practice its principles, then it should declare the breakdown of the Washington negotiations.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 25th – Japanese newspapers today again attacked the United States, accusing it of continuing its anti-Japanese encirclement tactics regardless of the continuation of the Washington talks. Jiji Shinpo prominently published a special dispatch from Guangzhou, accusing the United States of using the Philippines as a stepping stone, "attempting to seize hegemony over China and the southwestern Pacific under the pretext of assisting China." Asahi Shimbun published news that the Chinese side has concentrated 300,000 troops in southwestern China to defend the Yunnan-Burma Road, as a measure to prevent Japan from ending the Sino-Japanese War. Jiji Shinpo also carried news from Stanford that the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, is going to Washington, his main purpose being to establish a US-Soviet mutual agreement. The telegram claimed that it came from the US side and said that the Soviet Union proposed providing the United States with naval and air bases to contain Japan, disregarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. It also claimed that as a result of this proposal, the Soviet Union may become part of the encirclement of Japan.</p>
<h3>Thailand Senses the Threat of War; Calls Up Reservists; Believes Friendly Nations Will Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 15th – Bangkok official radio announced today that the Thai government has begun preparations to cope with a large-scale war. Radio said, "Although Thailand's involvement in the Pacific War seems inevitable, there is still a faint hope for peace. If the Thai government is forced to abandon its neutrality policy, Thailand will welcome the assistance of friendly nations, who will be happy to help us." Radio also announced that several classes of reservists have been called up. Radio also appealed to Britain, the United States, and Japan to avoid war in the Pacific and asked the public to abide by the government's strict policy of neutrality.</p>
<h3>Britain Resolves to Go All Out to Back the US; An Expression from Te Water</h3>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 25th – British War Cabinet Far East Representative Te Water spoke here last night about Britain's resolve to back the United States when the United States is drawn into the Pacific War, saying that there is complete understanding and no secrets between the British and American governments. Britain will go all out to back the United States in the Pacific, as Mr. Churchill has already said. Referring to the suggestion that Britain should appoint a permanent commissioner to the Pacific region, Te Water said that he had investigated the matter and reported to the British government.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explodes at US Consulate in Saigon; Case Under Investigation</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 25th – The State Department announced yesterday that a high-explosive bomb exploded at the US Consulate in Saigon on Sunday. It is not known who placed the bomb. According to a report from US Consul Brown in Saigon, the walls, doors, and furniture of the consulate were damaged by the bomb, but there were no deaths or injuries, indicating that the bomb was placed on the floor outside the entrance. So far, the consulate has not obtained conclusive evidence as to who placed the bomb.</p>
<p>Reuters, Henan, 25th – Police are now investigating the bombing of the US Consulate in Saigon on Sunday night.</p>
<h3>Overseas Japanese Withdraw to Return Home; Over Ten Thousand Already</h3>
<p>Haito Agency, Tokyo, 25th – According to official sources here yesterday, since the freezing of Japanese funds, more than 10,000 Japanese have withdrawn from the four countries whose funds have been frozen, most of them returning from the United States, India, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Today, Information Bureau spokesman Kiishi Kazuichi hosted a group of reporters, who asked many questions about the US-Japan talks but were unable to obtain concrete information. When reporters asked whether the Tatsuta Maru's trip to the United States could be seen as a result of the Washington talks, the spokesman declined to answer. When asked whether the Tatsuta Maru should be called a ship "evacuating Japanese residents," the spokesman replied that since the United States issued the freezing order, many Japanese residents in the United States naturally had no reason to stay for long. Therefore, the dispatch of the Tatsuta Maru was only a matter of transporting passengers and mail to ease the inconvenience felt by both sides. As a result of negotiations with the Panamanian government, the Tatsuta Maru will also sail through Balboa to carry back Japanese residents who currently have no means of returning home. This is because the Panamanian government recently issued an order to crack down on Eastern expatriates. The Japanese government has protested about this matter but has not yet received a satisfactory response.</p>
<h3>Japan-Portugal Air Service Begins</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2-5 – The new Japanese air service between Dili, the capital of Portuguese Timor, and Palau Island, which is administered by Japan, began today, with a Japanese plane flying from Palau Island to Dili.</p>
<h3>Axis Partners Sign Protocol; Anti-Comintern Pact Extended for Five Years; Signatories Expand from Six to Thirteen Countries; Finland, Bulgaria, and Others Included</h3>
<p>Haito Agency, Berlin, 25th – Representatives of the governments of Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Hungary, and Manchukuo signed a protocol to commemorate the Anti-Comintern Pact concluded in 1936, stating that the pact has been effective and that continued cooperation is still necessary to deal with common enemies. Therefore, it has now been decided that the Anti-Comintern Pact will be extended for another five years from November 25, 1941. The entry into force of the treaty for countries that have now joined the treaty will take effect from the date that the German government receives their formal documentation. The Protocol further stipulates that after the expiry of the five-year extension period, the countries should continue to consult with each other and discuss continued cooperation issues. Today's commemoration ceremony was held at noon at the German Foreign Ministry. After Foreign Minister Ribbentrop gave a speech, the protocol was read out and signed, followed by speeches by the representatives of Italy, Japan, Spain, Hungary, and Manchukuo. Finally, the representatives of the seven countries wishing to join the Anti-Comintern Pact verbally expressed their intentions and submitted written memoranda. The seven countries are Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Croatia, Romania, Slovakia, and the Nanjing government. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then issued a statement before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Haito Agency, Berlin, 25th – The governments of Germany, Italy, Japan, Hungary, Manchukuo, and Spain recently signed a protocol at noon today at the Head of State's Office to extend the Anti-Comintern Pact for a period of five years. The full text is as follows: The governments of the six countries, Germany, Italy, Japan, Hungary, Manchukuo, and Spain, acknowledge that the agreement to resist the activities of the Comintern has been extremely satisfactory since its inception. For the sake of the future common interests of the countries, it is necessary to cooperate closely to cope with common enemies. It has therefore been decided to extend the term of the agreement for five years and the following provisions have been agreed: 1. The Anti-Comintern Pact, the Supplementary Book of November 25, 1936, the Protocol of November 6, 1937, the Protocol on Hungary's accession to the Pact of February 24, 1939, the Protocol on Manchukuo's accession to the Pact of February 24, 1939, and the Protocol on Spain's accession to the Pact of March 27, 1939, shall all be extended for a period of five years from November 25, 1941. 2. Any country that has officially announced its accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact at the invitation of the governments of Germany, Italy and Japan shall notify the German Government again by written declaration, which shall then be notified by Germany to the countries concerned. The German Government shall take effect from the date of receipt of its written declaration. This protocol shall be made in triplicate in German, Japanese and Italian, each of which is the original text. Before the expiry of the five-year period, the countries shall consult each other to discuss future cooperation issues. The representatives signing this Protocol are granted special privileges by the governments of the respective countries and have signed this Protocol, totaling six copies, 1941, 11th month, 25th day.</p>
<p>The Puppet Exhibition Is Worth Pondering</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – Several major newspapers in London this morning criticized Hitler's anti-communist "puppet exhibition" in editorials. The Times said that the Anti-Comintern Pact had been placed in cold storage for many years and has now been taken out again. Why was the anniversary of the pact in 1939 or 1940 not celebrated? The reason is obvious. No one is foolish enough to ask why Hitler happily canceled the pact based on the idea of 1939, and now he is happily reviving it on the fifth anniversary of its signing. The contrast between the two is worth pondering. None of the countries now signing the pact attaches more importance to it than Germany. Japan once attached importance to it, but at that time it had not yet realized Hitler's talent for turning clouds and rain. The Japanese opinions were enlightened by Ribbentrop's ruthlessness in August 1939, and shocked by Hitler's perfidy and violence in June 1941. Judging from the phenomenon, the conveners of this conference paid special attention to Japan. Recently, Japan's approach to Washington has made Berlin very worried and uneasy, so it seems to be the right time to make this soft-kneed partner return to its arms. However, Japanese politicians have not forgotten that Matsuoka's signing of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact in April of this year was due to Hitler's insidious encouragement, and it seems unlikely that they will be moved by this kind of blatant trick. The arguments of other newspapers are roughly the same. According to Reuters diplomatic reporters, Hitler originally planned to convene a New Order Conference in Moscow on November 17 to celebrate the failure of the Soviet Union and launch a peace offensive, but seeing that the invasion of the Soviet Union had failed, he changed his original plan and convened a meeting of the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact in Berlin. The first meeting was held in 1936, but in 1939 Germany turned to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, and the Anti-Comintern Pact was abandoned. Now that the five-year term has expired, German diplomacy has resumed the old affairs, and representatives of the Axis powers gathered in Berlin yesterday. The first to arrive was Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, followed by the Hungarian Foreign Minister and others. Representatives from Spain and Japan will also participate.</p>
<p>The Soviet-Japanese Agreement Remains Valid</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – Official opinion here believes that the continued accession of the seven countries, including Finland, to the Anti-Comintern Pact has no impact on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. When government officials were asked about this point, they firmly replied that this was a completely different matter and said that Japan recognized that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact was still valid.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th – The Information Bureau issued a statement today stating that the Japanese government believes that the expansion of the Anti-Comintern Pact and the participation of the seven new countries are of great significance. The six signatory countries of the pact (Germany, Italy, Japan, Manchukuo, Hungary, and Spain) have agreed to extend the pact for five years. The seven new countries joining are the Nanjing regime, Bulgaria, Finland, Romania, Denmark, Slovakia, and Croatia. It goes without saying that the Comintern, with its worldwide organization, is engaged in activities of a communist nature. Therefore, the scope of defense must also be extended to the whole world. Japan, with the construction of a New Order in East Asia as the basis of its national policy, deeply feels that the defense against the Communist Party is increasingly necessary and believes that the continuation of this Anti-Comintern Pact and the continued accession of seven countries is indeed worth celebrating.</p>

<p>Chongqing – Yesterday afternoon, the agenda of the seventh general meeting of the People's Political Council included 58 items in total, including administrative report review opinions and councilors' proposals. Thirty items were discussed, mostly issues related to education, society, and women, so their approval or rejection was extremely swift. Among the 28 cases that were not discussed, most were financial and economic issues, which were moved to the eighth general meeting this morning. The ninth general meeting in the afternoon was originally scheduled as a closed meeting to discuss a certain important issue, so today's meeting was truly one of the most important days of the ten-day session of the People's Political Council.

<h3>Communist Political Committee Holds Meeting in Yan'an: Urges All Political Parties to Cooperate; Chinese Communist Party Determined to Implement Democratic Principles</h3>
<p>Chongqing - While the National Political Council was holding a meeting in Chongqing, the Communist Political Committee of the Shaanxi-Ningxia-Gansu Border Region also held a meeting in Yan'an, the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party in northern Shaanxi. They also sent a telegram calling on all political parties in China to cooperate to the greatest extent possible. People here have paid great attention to this because of its extremely friendly tone towards the Kuomintang. In a telegram to the Central Headquarters of the Kuomintang, the Yan'an meeting expressed admiration for the glorious achievements of the Kuomintang in leading the country in the struggle for freedom and democracy, and called for continued enhancement of cooperation between the various political parties. The telegrams sent to the various leaders of the Kuomintang here used the same wording. People here are particularly interested in the speech given by Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Yan'an meeting. Mao said that the goal of the Chinese Communist Party is to cooperate with all political parties to realize the democratic principles of the founding father of the nation, and that China does not have the prerequisites for implementing communism. Mao also said that the social structure of China is like a cone, with the base representing the vast majority of the people in the lower classes, and the apex representing the very small number of large capitalists and landlords. The purpose of the CCP is to maintain a stable balance of interests between landlords and peasants, and between capitalists and laborers. Mao also urged non-communists to cooperate with each other for the sake of the national interest, and asked the Chinese Communists to correct their previous views, saying that many communists were misled by the theory of isolationism, alienated non-communists, and always thought they were infallible, and did not realize that communists should have the obligation to cooperate with people outside the party to build democracy. No power can prevent others from speaking, and no power can monopolize all institutions. We must allow others to express their opinions, and we cannot learn from them.

<h3>British Troops Land on French Coast Briefly</h3>
<p>Completed Mission and Safely Withdrew</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - It was officially announced here today that a small squad of British patrol soldiers landed in Normandy on Sunday night and have all safely returned. The above announcement was made in response to reports from the German side that they had repelled a British attempt to land on the French coast. The Information Department issued a routine statement saying that regarding the coastal areas of the occupied territories of France, the enemy is quite concerned about how we intend to act. Therefore, they hope to use deliberately exaggerated propaganda to induce us to reveal the truth. The landing mentioned in the German communique may refer to the landing of a small squad of British patrol soldiers in Normandy on the evening of November 23. The entire patrol team had returned to the ship, and only one person was shot in the arm by a machine gun.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Peace or War?</h3>
<p>US-Japan negotiations have been going on for three months. What exactly is being discussed is a question of concern to the world, and only facts can provide the answer. In the current stage, there are three points worth remembering: First, US Secretary of State Hull has formally stated that the nature of the current negotiations is "exploratory." Second, the authorities of China, Britain, and other countries have also repeatedly formally stated that they are kept informed of the details of the US-Japan negotiations. Third, it is gratifying that after the meeting between Hull and Kurusu, Nomura, and others the day before yesterday, they immediately convened a meeting of diplomatic representatives from China, Britain, and other countries.</p>
<p>There is another issue more important than the specific content of the negotiations, which is: what is the future of the US-Japan negotiations?</p>
<p>If the question that urgently awaits Japan's answer is peace or war, then, judging from various objective circumstances, its current situation is that peace is very difficult and war is very dangerous. But for the United States, the sacrifice is very light in war, and peace is always beneficial. These are the two most fundamental points in the current Far Eastern situation. On the one hand, they explain the recent bewilderment and panic of the Japanese authorities; on the other hand, they also explain the composure and leisure of the United States. In these two absolutely opposite situations, we still cannot find automatic agreement and harmony, or forced compromise and accommodation. Then, it is not difficult to imagine the future of these US-Japan negotiations.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the Japanese side. The biggest reason for its current hesitation between peace and war is, of course, the uncertainty of the outcome of the German-Soviet War. If Germany can defeat the Soviet army, or rush to the Caucasus and the Middle East, or even occupy Moscow and Leningrad, then the decision of Japan's attitude will be a relatively easy task. On the one hand, it can issue warnings and demands to Britain and the United States to respond to the German-Italian Western offensive, launching the greatest threat of northern advance, and force Britain and the United States to recognize its "Greater East Asia New Order"; on the other hand, in the event of a final crisis, a major war in the Pacific, it can also quickly take risks, attempting to repel the Soviet military power in the Far East in one fell swoop, eliminating its worries, and then turn around to engage in a contest with Britain and the United States in the Pacific, with Northeast China, the Soviet Maritime Province, and the occupied areas of North China as its bases on the continent. If the failure of the Soviet Union has become an irreversible and fixed fact, then the complete disillusionment of the East-West "New Order" attempts will be a natural conclusion. However, the current uncertainty of the victory or defeat of Germany and the Soviet Union makes it very difficult. At this time, if Japan rashly provokes the United States, then without a doubt, it will immediately fall into a difficult situation of fighting on all sides. Perhaps Germany will suffer defeat in the West, and the crisis that Japan will face at that time will probably be unprecedented in its history. So, will Japan accept the path of peace? The only possible ways to take this path are either to completely surrender to the forces of justice and abandon the attempt of the "New Order," or to let things take their course and continue the current situation of delay. If it is the former, then Japan's ambitions of several decades will be declared forever abandoned; if it is the latter, then the severity of the economic blockade pressure that Japan is currently under will one day lead it onto an irreversible path. In short, the unclear outcome of the Western battlefield is really the biggest factor in Japan's current bewilderment and distress. Perhaps there is no politician in Japan who dares to assert the victory or defeat of the German-Soviet war. Therefore, there is no Japanese leader who dares to rashly decide its fundamental national policy at this time, whether to accept peace or engage in war.</p>
<p>Looking at it from another perspective, the environment in which the United States is currently located is a very striking contrast compared to Japan. If its fundamental policy towards Japan is decided by war, then the meaning of that war, for it, is at most a large expenditure of money and a large-scale expedition of materials and war equipment. Of course, the skies, land, and sea of its own country will not become battlefields, and the lives of its people will not be affected. Even the expedition of personnel can be reduced to a minimum number in the situation where China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries are all fighting against Japan. Moreover, in the situation where the superior and inferior forces are absolutely disparate, it almost has a 120% chance of winning and has no need to worry about the future of such a war. This is fundamentally different from Japan's nationwide fear that it may turn into a battlefield and that a major disaster is imminent. Conversely, if the United States decides to continue to follow the path of peace in its policy towards Japan, then, whether it is to use political pressure to force Japan to surrender immediately, or to use a temporary laissez-faire approach to allow the current situation of heavy clouds but no rain to continue to drag on, the United States still holds the most important key. When using the first method, the United States can unite all the powers in the Far East and launch a common oppression against Japan, making Japan face an overwhelming advantage and having no choice but to surrender immediately. When using the second method, the United States has economic sanctions, the most deadly means against Japan, causing its current resources to be slowly depleted and gradually reaching a dead end; at the same time, the United States intensifies its assistance to Britain and the Soviet Union, promoting the failure of Germany and Italy, and supporting China's brave fight, accelerating the arrival of the total counteroffensive. Once Germany and Italy collapse, the situation in the Far East will definitely be easily resolved, not to mention that China will then launch a decisive counteroffensive! In short, under the established national policy of the United States, whether it is peace or war, it has a very wide range of room for maneuver, and what is especially important is that its chances of defeating Japan are now almost 100% in both aspects. Therefore, the withdrawal of the US Marines stationed in the Far East has already indicated that it is preparing for war by preventing any challenges from Japan; after the arrival of the Japanese special envoy Kurusu in Washington, the United States still accepted Japan's request and reopened negotiations with it, which also indicated that the United States indeed has full confidence and is not afraid to follow the path of peace to achieve its own goals.</p>
<p>However, looking deeper, the role and promotion of various other international factors are making the environments and attitudes of both Japan and the United States themselves tend to be more complex. There are two points worth pointing out here: First, the issue of the British and Soviet counteroffensives against Germany and Italy is causing them to not only demand a large amount of material assistance from the United States, but also to constantly expect the participation of American manpower, and this demand from Britain is especially obvious and urgent. When the United States participates in the counteroffensive, its first step is of course to resolve the unstable forces in the East first. Second, the predicament in which Germany and Italy find themselves is also causing them to constantly demand that Japan quickly respond in the East and attack the rear of Britain and the Soviet Union. If Japan intends to take advantage of the achievements of Germany and Italy's victory in the future and does not voluntarily withdraw from the Tripartite Pact, then it must obey the demands of Germany and Italy and respond to them with action at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Finally, judging from the situation, before the spring of next year, neither the British and Soviet demands for American participation nor the German and Italian urging for Japanese response will reach a decisive stage, and before that, the issue of peace and war between the United States and Japan does not seem to be coming to a final juncture.</p>
<h3>German Troops Vigorously Attack, Moscow's Situation Critical; Soviet Troops Assemble Reserves for Desperate Battle, Central Area Covered in Vast Expanse of White Snow</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: Moscow is currently facing its most severe crisis since the German attacks began. It is said that the German High Command has announced the capture of Solnechnogorsk. If this is true, then German troops are only 30 miles northwest of Moscow. The German side has claimed that this is the closest the German troops have been to Moscow. Although this has not been confirmed, dispatches from Moscow admit that large German tank forces have approached Klin. The Soviet "News" newspaper stated that if Hitler does not try his best now, he will never succeed. Soviet radio broadcasts stated that Soviet troops north of Moscow have abandoned three locations and retreated to new positions. At the same time, fresh Soviet troops are continuously heading to the front lines. According to the Soviet official news agency, troops are being transported by train day and night westward from the east, south, and north of the Soviet Union. Tanks and armored vehicles are also being transported west to the front lines. The Soviet Union has just now deployed reserve troops to fight.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 25th Dispatch: Moscow Radio reported a short time ago that Hitler's troops yesterday launched a fierce attack on the Soviet capital on the Klin Highway amidst heavy snow. Two armored divisions and one motorized division have passed Klin and are approaching the main highway after passing the area around point K. The radio stated that our army is continuing to reinforce and is making every effort to defend against the enemy. It is reported that Soviet resistance around Volokolamsk is particularly fierce, and the Soviet lines in the Naro-Fominsk area are still being held by Soviet troops. However, Soviet troops in the Mozhaisk area have been retreating under pressure. Regarding the rumored German vanguard reaching Solnechnogorsk, 31 miles from Moscow, Soviet sources have not yet confirmed this. Moscow dispatches also stated that there has been heavy snow in the entire area in recent days, and the cold is increasing. Many Germans have been freezing. The houses and streets of Moscow are covered in thick snow, creating a vast expanse of white.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th Dispatch: According to an official German announcement, the town of Solnechnogorsk in the distant suburbs of Moscow has been occupied by German troops. The town is located 50 kilometers northwest of Moscow, has a population of 6,500, several factories, and has village houses and recreational areas, purely suburban scenery. The railway from Leningrad to Moscow passes through the town. The fall of the town has completely isolated Moscow from the Volga region southeast of Kalinin.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: German troops on the Moscow front continue to attack fiercely, and a desperate battle is underway. It is reported that the German side has mobilized no fewer than 40 divisions for this attack on Moscow, while in October, the German side only sent 17 divisions to probe the Soviet capital. The Soviet side admits that Soviet troops have retreated in Klin and Tula, but Soviet troops are holding their ground elsewhere along the line, and the German advance is much slower than the initial attack on Moscow. The battle situation on the Moscow front from north to south can be described as follows: Heavy fighting is currently taking place in Kalinin (100 miles northwest of Moscow). German attempts to break through the Soviet lines have all been repelled. Volokolamsk (70 miles northwest of Moscow): German troops have advanced slightly along the Volokolamsk-Moscow highway, occupying several villages. Soviet troops are holding their ground and launching counterattacks. Mozhaisk (60 miles west-northwest of Moscow): Soviet troops have retreated in an orderly manner to defensive positions. German attacks along the highway have been repelled. Naro-Fominsk (40 miles southwest of Moscow): Soviet troops are holding the Nara River.

<p>Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: Due to the heavy losses of tanks on both sides and the expansion of the war zone to hilly areas, the first stage of large-scale tank warfare in the Western Desert has come to an end, and infantry seems to be rising. News has come that the two armies have engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The center of the main battle is still El Agheila. As for whether the British troops breaking out of Tobruk have reunited with the main force, there is still no news. Indian troops between Halfaya Pass and Omar are still operating behind enemy defenses. After New Zealand troops occupied Gambut yesterday, they are now advancing towards Tobruk and may be able to participate in the main battle in time.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 25th Dispatch: New Zealand troops in North Africa are currently engaged in a wedge-shaped penetration in Gambut and Bardia. The British garrison in Tobruk is rapidly consolidating its positions and narrowing the gap south of Tobruk. It is reported that the gap is now only a few miles wide. Indian troops are still besieging the stubborn enemy in the Halfaya Pass and Omar area. South African troops have also joined the fierce hand-to-hand combat near El Agheila, south of Tobruk. In the war zone, there are two slopes that are close to each other, and there are winding valleys that flow into the sea, which are not suitable for large tanks to operate in. Last night, a British military spokesperson claimed that a large-scale tank battle had broken out around El Agheila, and the war had spread to a wide area, but it was still difficult to determine the outcome. Both sides are fighting with all their might, so the battle situation is extremely fierce. The occupation of Gambut is very important, as it is one of the enemy's main supply bases for turning to Gazala to obtain supplies. It is now believed that the German troops have withdrawn from the Gambut airfield. At the same time, the British Air Force continues to attack the Axis powers' supply bases. The number of tanks is gradually decreasing due to damage. However, both sides are able to quickly repair tanks on the battlefield. Previous news gave the impression that the air resistance encountered by the British was very weak. In fact, the enemy planes are resisting quite strongly, and there is a trend of becoming more intense. There are no major battles in the skies over the war zone or behind the British lines, but there are often fierce battles in the skies over the German-occupied areas, as the British Air Force flies to force the Axis planes to fight.</p>
<h3>United States Sends Army to Dutch Guiana to Protect Valuable Bauxite Mines, Agreement Obtained in Advance with the Dutch Government</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th Dispatch: The White House announced yesterday that a U.S. military unit has been ordered to go to Suriname in Dutch Guiana, South America, to protect valuable bauxite mines, as the United States relies heavily on this for aluminum extraction. This mine protection measure was agreed upon by the U.S. and Dutch governments and endorsed by the Brazilian government. According to diplomatic circles, the reason why the Dutch government decided to ask the United States to protect its Guiana bauxite mines is because there have been frequent reports of Nazi activities in French Guiana. As for whether the U.S. government has received intelligence that the Nazis plan to destroy this mine, it has not been disclosed by officials. In 1940, Suriname produced 615,434 tons of bauxite. Encouraged by new procedures in the mining industry, it is expected to produce one million tons this year.</p>
<h3>U.S. Lend-Lease Act</h3>
<p>Applicable to Free French Forces</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 25th Dispatch: The representative of the Free French Forces in the United States announced yesterday that President Roosevelt has approved the Lend-Lease Act to apply to General de Gaulle's troops, as the U.S. President recognizes that the land under the jurisdiction of the Free French Forces is closely related to U.S. defense.</p>
<h3>Germany Plans to Reinforce North Africa from Greece, Many Ships Gather in Thessaloniki</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch: According to American Broadcasting Corporation spokesman Aglansky in a broadcast from Ankara this morning, Germany may seek to transport new supplies into Libya via Crete. According to military sources in Ankara, a large number of tanks and military supplies have recently been transported by train from Vienna to Thessaloniki, with two or three trains arriving daily since November 15. This news was initially reported by a Turkish correspondent in Yugoslavia. The Axis powers have recently gathered about 150,000 tons of merchant ships in Thessaloniki. According to reliable sources, Italy and Romania have also transported military supplies to the port. Yesterday, British General Auchinleck in Libya stated in a broadcast that he had received intelligence that the Axis powers were now planning to send reinforcements to Libya from Greece and Italy. The British military attaché in Ankara said that Axis ships could travel along the Greek coast to Crete without danger. With German escort teams protecting them with aircraft, it would be easy to smuggle across to Libya from Crete at night. A large-scale Axis air force is currently gathered in Crete, it is said.</p>

<h3>U.S. Yangtze River Fleet in China Reduces Number of Patrol Ships, Flagship USS Luzon Still Moored in Shanghai for Defense, Two Shallow-Draft Gunboats Will Sail Back to Base</h3>
<p>Madison Steamer Prepares Cargo Hold, Departure of U.S. Troops Delayed</p>
<p>Last night, sources within the U.S. Navy in Shanghai revealed that the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet in China had received orders from the Navy Department in Washington to withdraw part of its river defense gunboats. The exact number of ships to be withdrawn has not been fully determined. The destination will be Manila, the same as the Fourth Marine Regiment. The order was issued by Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, received the order and immediately directed all of its gunboats to await orders. The Yangtze River Fleet belongs to the U.S. Asiatic Fleet and is under the command of Rear Admiral Bimees, Commander of the U.S. Far East Sixteenth Naval District. The fleet currently has five gunboats: USS Luzon (575 tons), USS Wake (450 tons), USS Tutuila (370 tons), and USS Mindanao. USS Tutuila is currently moored in Chongqing, and USS Mindanao is patrolling the waters off southern China. USS Luzon is stationed in Shanghai and serves as the fleet's flagship.</p>
<p>Reduction in Number of Ships Does Not Mean Full Withdrawal</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 25th Dispatch: The Navy Department announced yesterday that several of the seven U.S. gunboats serving in the Yangtze River Patrol will soon be withdrawn. The Navy Department did not announce the exact number of ships to be withdrawn or their destination. Two retreat ships from the President Lines company will carry the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment from Shanghai to Manila at the end of this week. Therefore, it is believed that these U.S. gunboats will follow these two ships to the Philippines. Since President Roosevelt announced his decision to withdraw the Marine Corps from China, it has been recognized that the withdrawal of U.S. Yangtze River gunboats will be inevitable. Therefore, this announcement by the Navy Department is not surprising. United Press International, Washington, 25th Dispatch: An official of the Navy Department announced yesterday that some American warships of the Yangtze River Patrol, under the command of Rear Admiral Glassford, will be withdrawn. A spokesperson for the Navy Department told the United Press International, "The Navy Department is now reducing the number of warships in the Yangtze River Patrol, but not leaving completely." The spokesperson did not say where these withdrawn warships would go, or the exact number of patrol warships ordered to remain on the Yangtze River. It is believed that this order will not affect the USS Tutuila, currently stationed in Chongqing, and the USS Mindanao, currently patrolling southern China.</p>
<p>USS Wake and USS Wake to Depart First</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Navy only stated that it would withdraw part of the Yangtze River Fleet, and did not mention the number, informed sources stated yesterday that the USS Tutuila and USS Mindanao will remain in their respective patrol areas. The USS Wake and USS Wake, which may be withdrawn within a considerable period of time, are the USS Wake, formerly moored in Wuhu, which arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd, and the USS Wake, moored in Hankou, which also left Hankou yesterday for Shanghai, with 30 soldiers, six officers, and Captain Harris on board. It is reported that the USS Wake is expected to arrive here within two days, and then withdraw together. At that time, personnel from the U.S. Navy Purchasing Office may leave Shanghai on these two ships. Their destination should be Manila, the current gathering place of the Asiatic Fleet.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Glassford to Remain in Shanghai</p>
<p>Among the Yangtze River Fleet, the USS Tutuila is stationed in Chongqing and cannot be withdrawn, and the USS Mindanao is patrolling southern China and will not be withdrawn. Therefore, the fleet actually relies on the USS Luzon, USS Wake, and USS Wake. Since the U.S. Navy Department stated that there would be a partial withdrawal, there is no reason to order these three ships to leave China completely. Now that the USS Wake and USS Wake have left their original defense areas and come to Shanghai to await orders for withdrawal, the USS Luzon should naturally remain in Shanghai. This point has been confirmed by U.S. Navy authorities. Therefore, Rear Admiral Glassford will remain stationed in Shanghai and will not withdraw until there is a situation in the Pacific. Yesterday, foreign sources stated that the USS Luzon would remain until the final withdrawal, and if necessary, would carry U.S. government officials from Shanghai. The captain of the USS Luzon is Brock, and the entire ship has 70 soldiers and 24 officers, including Rear Admiral Glassford's staff.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Preparations Completed Long Ago</p>
<p>According to another source, the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet is part of the Asiatic Fleet. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, ordered Rear Admiral Glassford in mid-month to make preparations for withdrawal. After receiving the order, Glassford completed the necessary preparations in the middle of this month, and will withdraw after the formal order arrives. It is also learned that the USS Wake and USS Wake will escort the first battalion of the Fourth Marine Regiment on the USS Harrison on Sunday to the Philippines.</p>
<p>First Batch of U.S. Troops Postponed Departure from Shanghai</p>
<p>According to reliable sources obtained last night, the Second Battalion of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the USS Madison this morning. Now, the ship has been ordered by the U.S. authorities to convert all of its cabins into dormitories so that each U.S. soldier can have a cot to adapt to military life. Therefore, it must be postponed. As for the First Battalion, it will leave Shanghai on the USS Harrison on the 30th without any changes. The "Farewell Broadcast" will be held at the new customs wharf at 10:15 am that day. Mr. Mackay, General Manager of Citibank, will be the reporter. In addition to the Regiment Commander Colonel Howard and the Yangtze River Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford giving speeches, officers and soldiers of the team will be invited to give short talks at any time. As the team is about to leave Shanghai, it must load the camp onto the ship, so the team's motor transport team has been very busy in recent days. It is reported that representatives of the British Residents' Association and the U.S. Department of Commerce have scheduled a joint farewell party for Commander Howard and other officers at the Columbia Road Country Club from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm today, which will be a grand occasion. According to the U.S. Marine Corps officers who attended the public banquet of the American Chamber of Commerce the night before, that night was the best banquet they had participated in in Shanghai, so they felt more and more reluctant to leave Shanghai. Everyone who participated in the banquet was extremely happy.</p>
<h3>British Evacuation Ship Ming Sang Scheduled to Sail South</h3>
<p>There is also talk of sailing to Yantai first to pick up evacuees</p>
<p>In order to speed up the departure of the more than 1,000 evacuees who have registered, the British Embassy has ordered the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire shipping companies to allocate ships for evacuation as soon as possible. It is learned that Butterfield &amp; Swire's Anhui Steamer will arrive in Shanghai as scheduled on the 28th. Jardine Matheson's Ming Sang Steamer was originally scheduled to carry passengers to Hong Kong, but was temporarily ordered to prepare specifically for evacuation, so all passenger tickets were transferred to the Yu Sang Steamer, which will sail to Hong Kong next. The Ming Sang Steamer is now scheduled to sail south to Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. The Anhui and Ming Sang steamers can accommodate a total of 700-800 passengers. Currently, 275 people have registered for evacuation, so the British Embassy will continue to allocate ships to meet the needs. It is learned that the British evacuees leaving Shanghai will be transferred to Australia and India after arriving in Hong Kong. It is also learned that the Yu Sang Steamer left Shanghai for Hong Kong last Wednesday and arrived in Shantou. It was detained for two days due to the Japanese inspection of passenger feces and arrived safely in Hong Kong at noon yesterday. After the ship arrives in Shanghai on the next trip, it will carry passengers who have had their tickets refunded from the Ming Sang Steamer to Hong Kong. British residents in Yantai, North China, are also preparing to evacuate, and there is also talk of the Ming Sang Steamer going to Yantai to pick up evacuees.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Plans to Send Special Ships to Evacuate Japanese Residents in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Ten Ships Designated to Depart in Different Directions, Expected to Take Place in Late Month or Early Next Month</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper, regarding the evacuation of Japanese residents from overseas, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities issued a statement on the 24th, explaining everything. It is said that since the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands implemented asset freeze orders against Japan, Japanese residents in these countries and their territories have gradually found it difficult to maintain their lives and businesses. Therefore, the number of people hoping to return home has been increasing.</p>
<p>Designated Ship Names</p>
<p>In view of this, the Japanese government has negotiated with these countries, but these countries have no convenient ships for Japanese residents to take to evacuate. Recently, the number of Japanese residents in various places hoping to return home has increased more than before. Therefore, as a result of discussions between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the parties concerned, it was decided that the Japanese side would send ships to various places for Japanese residents to take to return home. Ryuta Maru, Hikawa Maru, and Taiyo Maru will be sent to Hawaii this month and next month, Hie Maru will go to the Indian Ocean, Fuso Maru, Asama Maru, and Hakone Maru will go to the Straits Settlements and the Philippines, Takachiho Maru, Nissho Maru, and Fuji Maru will go to the Dutch East Indies. Each of these ships is currently on its way back to Japan. Regarding the United States and Panama, it is also being considered to send Ryuta Maru.</p>
<p>Number of Evacuees</p>
<p>Approximately more than 10,000 Japanese residents will return home from various places. Regarding their employment after returning home, the relevant provinces are mediating and researching protection and relief measures. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also decided to send personnel to various places when Japanese residents evacuate, return home, and arrive at Suma Beach in Kobe to cooperate with local officials to provide care and facilitate everything. For those who lack travel expenses or funds, all food, accommodation, and return home expenses will be borne by the Japanese authorities in order to provide comprehensive protection.</p>
<h3>Loford Appointed Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau</h3>
<p>After Lordford, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, was transferred from office on the 23rd of this month, he has been appointed Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau by the Inspectorate General of Customs. Mr. Lordford will rest for a few days and will take office at the bureau next week. There will be no changes to other personnel in the bureau.</p>
<p>Construction Ship Crew Appeals for Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Since the Japanese rented the Construction, a large dredger of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, to Moji, all the crew members have been dismissed by Mr. Maas, an engineer in the dredging department of the bureau. All employees have petitioned the bureau to withdraw the order and maintain the livelihoods of the employees. It is learned that according to the number of dismissals proposed by Mr. Maas, the first batch will be 36 people. Zhu Mujin and Zhang Along, who were once captured by the Japanese, have been released for a short time and are also on the list of dismissals. Lu Xianhua had previously asked the bureau for leave due to illness and is also on the list of dismissals. This has caused unease among all Chinese employees, especially Mr. Maas's arbitrary and unreasonable dismissals, which are very indignant. According to the bureau's regulations, employees can serve until the age of 60 if there is no fault. On the 28th of last month, Mr. Maas verbally notified the employees of the Construction to report to the bureau from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. Considering that the ship Chang, at that time, was scattered in various homes in Wusong, Gaoqiao, Pudong, etc. due to the Japanese arrest, how could they be gathered in this hasty time? Therefore, it is unfair both in terms of reason and emotion. The bureau has been asked to withdraw the order and thoroughly investigate Mr. Maas, an engineer in the dredging department, for arbitrarily oppressing employees in order to quell public anger.</p>

Most of the goods in Tongyi Trading Company are daily necessities for foreigners, and Chinese people rarely buy them, so there are no translations, or they are not consistent. Johnson Trading Company is located abroad, and there is only an agency in Shanghai. The address is unknown.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Foreign Flour Arrives in Shanghai Soon; The Shanghai Municipal Council Will Set Price Limits at 35 to 36 Yuan; Decision Made Yesterday Morning to Order Another 100,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council intends to follow the example of controlling rice prices with bold action to manage flour prices, setting a price limit of 35 to 36 yuan per bag. Yesterday morning, a meeting of importing merchants was convened to discuss the matter of ordering another 100,000 bags of flour to be shipped to Shanghai. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the first batch of flour shipped to Shanghai is already on its way, totaling 64,000 bags. Once this flour arrives, the Shanghai Municipal Council is determined to curb market speculation in flour and set a maximum price of 35 to 36 yuan per bag. Now, a considerable quantity of flour can be obtained locally at a reasonable price to meet the needs of legitimate consumers. Therefore, residents can register at Room 701 of the Shanghai Municipal Council office. It is now known that in the most recent week, the number of applicants registering with the Shanghai Municipal Council’s grain registration office has gradually decreased, clearly indicating that residents' food needs have been adequately met.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women's Support Association of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held its first autumn general meeting at the new residence of its president, Mrs. Xiao Zhiji, yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., with a very enthusiastic turnout. Furthermore, the Chinese Leprosy Asylum at 16 Bailinan Road currently houses 121 patients, including 24 women and 16 children. As the severe cold has arrived, the patients urgently need winter clothing and cotton quilts, and assistance from all sectors is being sought. If you have such clothing or cash to donate, you can send it directly to the asylum, or to the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association office at 25 Chihong Road, or call 36563, and a representative will be sent to collect it.</p>
<h3>Funeral Service for Mr. Artimus Presided Over by Chaplain of the U.S. Fourth Marines; Entire American Unit of the Volunteer Corps Participates in Full Dress; Cremated Remains to be Shipped to the United States</h3>
<p>The funeral service for the late Mr. Artimus, General Manager of the China General Edison Company and Chairman and General Manager of this newspaper's board of directors, was held on Sunday at the International Funeral Home. Many Chinese and foreign friends attended. Members of the American unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps participated in full dress.

<h3>Gasoline Rationing Indefinitely Postponed</h3>
<p>It is reported that major gasoline companies have decided to continue the rationing system. The gasoline allocation for December has already been decided, and the applications from various users are currently being reviewed. New gasoline permits will be distributed to users before the end of this month. New car owners are finding it difficult to obtain gasoline permits, so their gasoline supply will likely depend on the "black market." However, an executive from one gasoline company stated that they are determined to do their utmost to meet legitimate needs and prevent speculators from profiting from it. However, when applying for gasoline allocation, users are requested to state their minimum needs, as the company will not supply large quantities of gasoline. Although gasoline tankers arrive from time to time, the quantity imported is limited, so gasoline companies have decided to continue this rationing system indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Trade with Japan Decreases in Output and Input Last Month</h3>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs announcement, Shanghai's trade with Japan in October showed imports of 2,063,000 gold units and exports of 15,412,000 yuan. Compared to September, imports decreased by 2,677,000 gold units, approximately 55%, and exports decreased by 31,336,000 yuan, approximately 67%. The reasons for this are firstly, a shortage of ships, and secondly, a decrease in exports from occupied areas and a reduction in the production of local products. Imports in October were still dominated by raw silk, rayon, and general merchandise. Machinery, seafood, medicinal materials, spices, books, and fuels all decreased. Exports were dominated by coarse grains, which decreased by one-third compared to September. The remaining categories, such as textiles, fibers, leather, seeds, and soybeans, all decreased by percentages ranging from 10% to 70%.</p>
<h3>Cholera Cases Decrease Last Month, Malaria Cases Increase to High Levels</h3>

<h3>Murder Case Occurs in the Ya Lu Bookstore; Xu Kaipu Shot in the Head and Killed</h3>
<p>Xu Kaipu, a 30-year-old man from Yangzhou, graduated from the Sino-French School on Route Mitterand. He lived with his mother and three younger brothers at No. 10, Lane 3, Guian Lane, Rue Glock, in the French Concession. Two years ago, he worked as a translator for the political department of the French Police, but was dismissed by the police authorities due to an incident. Xu then went to the occupied areas to earn a living. Half a year ago, he returned to Shanghai from the occupied areas and worked in a certain capacity in Hongkou, leaving early and returning late, as was his custom. Recently, Xu suddenly sent his elderly mother and three younger brothers back to their</p>
<p>hometown of Yangzhou,</p>
<p>and sold the house in Guian Lane for 1,500 yuan. Because Xu Kaipu had a friendly relationship with Gao Xingfa, the owner of the Ya Lu Bookstore at No. 48 Rue Glock, he temporarily resided upstairs in the Ya Lu Bookstore. Yesterday afternoon at 4:15 p.m., after returning home, Xu rested for a while and then went downstairs to the Ya Lu Bookstore. He sat at a seat in the northeast corner of the bookstore, concentrating intently, drinking tea, and listening to the storytelling. Suddenly, a man shot him once from behind. The bullet entered the back of his head and exited his left forehead. Xu fell to the ground injured, with blood gushing out like a fountain. Because the injury was in a vital area,</p>
<p>he died instantly.</p>
<p>At the time, the other listeners in the bookstore suddenly heard the gunshot and were extremely frightened. They all rushed out the door to escape, causing great chaos. Upon receiving the report, the French Police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. However, the murderer had already escaped without a trace. Xu Kaipu's body was sent to the Tairas Road morgue for examination. When Xu was attacked, he was wearing a gray striped wool suit, yellow leather shoes, and white gold-rimmed glasses. The police authorities are currently investigating the reason for Xu's attack.</p>
<h3>Verdict Reached on the Three Perpetrators in the Assassination of Mr. Mamatov</h3>
<p>On September 14th, the assassination of Russian businessman Mamatov occurred at the intersection of Rue Lafayette and Lane 252. After being sent to the hospital, Mr. Mamatov mumbled, "Hovannes killed me," and then died of his injuries. Hovannes, a Russian actor and writer, was immediately arrested by the French Police. Hovannes vehemently denied any involvement in the case and even launched a counterattack against the French Police, wanting to reveal something to "clarify the entire event." However, Hovannes never revealed what that was. The other perpetrator, Liu, and Zhang, who hired Liu to commit the assassination, both confessed. Yesterday (the 24th), the verdict was reached. Hovannes was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for instigating the assassination, Liu was sentenced to long-term imprisonment, and Zhang was sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Adulterated Cooking Oil Sold as Pure, Yuan Xiang Sauce Shop Fined</h3>
<p>Yuan Mao Sauce Shop at 314 Avenue Edward VII, recently adulterated the cooking oil it sold by adding water, deceiving the public. Subsequently, Zhou Acai, a female servant surnamed Hu at No. 1, Ji'an Lane, Jixiang Street, French Concession, after purchasing this adulterated oil, was unable to exchange it, leading to a dispute. The police were called in and brought Zhou to the Central Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Kang Zengxiang, the facts were verified. He then reported to the First Special Court to prosecute Chai Shangchu and Chai Qingxiang, the persons in charge of Yuan Mao Sauce Shop, for fraud. They had already been summoned once. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunji argued that the defendants' actions made the purchased oil useless and that they were exploiting the public during a time of high prices, which was particularly egregious. He requested that they be severely punished according to the law. After Judge Zhan questioned the matter clearly, he sentenced Chai Qingxiang to a fine of 500 yuan, or imprisonment with three yuan counted as one day. Chai Shangchu was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Fire on Tiantong Road</h3>
<p>At around 11 a.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in a residence at No. 11, Lane 737 (i.e., Tai'an Lane), Tiantong Road, Public Concession. The fire quickly spread through the roof and to the neighboring houses on both sides. Upon learning of this, the Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the fire. After about an hour, the fire was extinguished. In addition to the house at the aforementioned address being completely destroyed, it also affected part of the neighboring houses at No. 13, etc.</p>
<h3>Time Bomb Explodes in the San He Lou Restaurant; Two Men Sent in and Fled, Fortunately No One Injured; A Total of Three Bomb Incidents Occurred Yesterday</h3>
<p>At around 8 p.m. last night, two men in Western suits went to the San He Lou Tianjin Cuisine Restaurant at No. 30 Avenue Edward VII, opposite the Great World, for dinner in the snack section. After sitting down, they placed a square paper package on table number seven, sat for a short while, and then the two men made excuses to leave one after the other, fleeing without a trace. At that time, there were many diners in the snack section, and the waiters were extremely busy. They did not pay attention to the two men slipping out or the package on the table. Unexpectedly, the package on the table turned out to be a small time bomb. Ten minutes after the two men left, it suddenly exploded, filling the area with black smoke and flying iron fragments. The explosion was extremely loud. At that time, the diners were all shocked and fled outside in droves. Afterwards, the police dispatched detectives to investigate. Fortunately, no one was injured. It is said that two months ago, a person went to the San He Lou and asked the owner of the restaurant to pay a business fee of 200 yuan for every 1,000 yuan in business. However, there was no result. It is impossible to verify whether this case is related to the demand for payment of the business fee.</p>
<p>Heji Earth Goods Store, located at No. 580 Fujian Road, Public Concession, is opened by Shen Yucheng, a person from Pudong. Recently, due to poor business, he rented out part of the store to others to open a firewood shop. At around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, three men suddenly came, carrying a paper package, placed it on the counter of the firewood shop, and said to the old servant, Xu Asan, from Jiading, "Please ask your boss, Zhou, to come out." Before he could finish speaking, one of the two smoke bombs hidden in the package exploded, filling the air with thick smoke. Seeing that the matter was exposed, the three men quickly fled out of the store. The patrol officers who were called in arrived and arrested the three men. According to their confession, they were hired by someone to deliver it, and the rest of the confession was evasive. Also, at around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, when someone was dumping garbage inside Lane 28, Rue Pichon, two hand grenades were found in the garbage can. They immediately reported this to the clerk, who reported it to the French Police, who took the grenades away. It is reported that the two grenades were wooden-handled. The police have already begun investigating the source.</p>
<h3>Assassination in Hongkou Yesterday; Japanese Businessman Shot; Kimura Masakazu Shot in the Back and Abdomen; Japanese Side Searches for the Murderer Without Success</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, another shooting of a Japanese person occurred in Hongkou. Afterwards, the Japanese side dispatched a team to conduct a thorough search at the scene of the incident, and then quickly expanded the search area. Areas such as the Zhabei Railway Station, which is adjacent to Hongkou, were also subjected to a strict search, but no suspects were found. However, the bridges across the Suzhou Creek were not closed off. Kimura Masakazu, a 29-year-old Japanese man and employee of a Japanese cotton mill in Hongkou, was wearing Western-style clothes and was on his way from home to work at around 7 a.m. yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, as he walked to the corner of Huasheng Road and Kunming Road, a man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Without asking any questions, he pulled out a pistol and fired two shots (some say four shots) at Kimura's back. At that time, one bullet penetrated Kimura's back and entered his abdomen without exiting. The other bullet hit his shoulder. He immediately collapsed into a pool of blood. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the gunman immediately turned around and fled without a trace. Soon after, the Japanese side received the news and rushed to send the injured person to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. It is reported that the injuries are very serious, and his life may be in danger. The case is currently under investigation.</p>

<h3>Paramour Killer Sentenced</h3>

On the morning of the 5th of this month at 7:40 a.m., he used a sharp blade to threaten Yao, hoping she would change her attitude. Because of Yao's resistance, Liu's anger arose from the heart, and he violently slashed at Yao with the blade, causing her to be injured in several places. Afterwards, Wu Fengkai, a Chinese detective from the New Gate Police Station, arrested Liu and handed him over to the First Special Court. The trial has already concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin of the Second Criminal Court announced the verdict. Liu was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to nine years of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Report on the Findings of the Central Geological Survey Exploration Team; Northward to the Banks of the Yellow River, Entering Shaanxi and Turning to Gansu, Discovering Dragon Bones and Dinosaur Footprints, etc.</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Central Geological Survey has newly formed many exploration teams this year, which have gone to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Guiyang, and other places to conduct investigations and have made considerable gains. The following is a separate record. The Northwest Sichuan Exploration Team, led by Hui Shiying and Xiong Yongxian as the main and deputy team leaders, respectively, led a team of four members to inspect the grasslands west of Songpan. They departed from Beibei on March 1st. As of now, it has been eight months. They have been as far north as the border between Sichuan and Gansu, on the banks of the Yellow River, and as far west as the He Luo. The area south to Matang is a grassland plateau 3,200 meters above sea level, which is virgin territory in terms of scientific study. This trip discovered the watershed between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, with gravel on the riverbed. From this, it can be inferred that the capture phenomenon of the rivers is a significant contribution. In terms of mineral resources, placer gold and peat were found in many places. The climate is bitterly cold, with only spring and winter. The growing season for crops is at most only 90 days. Although there is good soil quality, it is limited by the climate, and the prospect of agricultural reclamation is not very promising. The Upper Jialing River Exploration Team, led by Yang Zhongjian and four others, walked along the Jialing River into Shaanxi and turned to Gansu. They successively discovered many dragon bone producing areas in Baoji, Paiyang, Longxian, Tianshui, Chengxian, and other places, and collected three dinosaur footprints, which can be called treasures. Currently, Mr. Yang has returned to the institute in Beibei to begin studying his findings. Huang Jiqing and four others went to northern Gansu in September to thoroughly survey the oil mines. The first phase of the work can be completed within the year. When Mr. Huang went to Gansu, Ma Rongzhi and Lu Zhaoxia of the institute accompanied him to Lanzhou and have transferred to Qinghai. Currently, the eastern part of the province is being investigated for soil and geology. Next spring, they will go to the Qaidam Basin for exploration. It is expected that there will be great prospects. In addition, there are several survey teams in Kang, Qian, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other provinces. All the work is in progress.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Library Announces Official Establishment</h3>

<h3>Visiting Ding Guangxie's Painting Exhibition; The Painting Exhibition is Scheduled to Close Tonight</h3>
<p>— Pan Yinge</p>
<p>Tang Bohu's hometown - Suzhou, is a breeding ground for literary and artistic talents. Since the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, all literature, painting, and music have flourished in our county. Music, such as Kunqu opera, its origin and evolution, are all in Suzhou. Literature goes without saying. Painting is also considered to be dominated by talents from Suzhou. After hundreds of years, although circumstances have changed, the trend has not subsided. Yesterday, I went to the Daxin Painting Hall to see Mr. Ding Guangxie's landscape paintings. Although his painting methods are the same as ordinary oil paintings, ordinary oil paintings are still good to look at, but if you look at them from two or three feet away, you will find them crude and unsightly. However, Mr. Ding's paintings are different. His brushstrokes are extremely fine, his color matching is extremely uniform, and his colors are extremely bright, almost forming a whole with natural scenery. The mountains and rivers of our Suzhou are always clear and beautiful, and there are beautiful scenery everywhere. Mr. Ding depicts them using Western methods, and his artistic conception and brushstrokes are no different from Tang Ziwei. Tang Bohu's landscape paintings also use extremely elaborate brushstrokes. When painting flowing water, you can see the ripples. When painting ancient pines, you can see the fine needles. Now Mr. Ding's Western paintings truly have the legacy of the sages of the village. After viewing them, I can't help but feel very admired. I once said that the most intelligent can rejoice in all the natural sounds and compose them into musical movements. The most discerning can appreciate all the natural lines and colors and transmit them into paintings. Mr. Ding is probably the enlightened one among those who have left their homeland. I often love to recite the poems of Lin Hejing of the Song Dynasty, in which there are natural landscapes and the artistic conception of creation can be discovered. Today, looking at Ding's paintings, it is like reading Lin's poems. It can make people forget everything and only see the beauty of nature. The painting exhibition closes tonight. Social ladies and gentlemen, why not go and visit?</p>

There were countless wreaths and elegiac couplets. For a time, the plain carriages and white horses were extremely sorrowful.</p>
<h3>News from Yizhong Women's Supplementary School</h3>
<p>Yizhong Women's Supplementary School, located at No. 16, Lane 215, Myert Strasse, in this city, held a charity soccer match last week to raise funds, which has now come to a successful conclusion. The ticket revenue is currently being audited by an accountant and will be announced soon. It is now learned that the school will expand its scope of service from the next semester, deciding to add handicraft classes and other classes to enroll more poor, out-of-school, and unemployed women and conduct them on a voluntary basis without tuition fees. However, because the original school building is insufficient for use, it is publicly soliciting several branch school locations. Classrooms, no matter how many, are welcome. If any schools in this city have classrooms available for rent from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., please inform the school by letter and a representative will be sent to discuss it in person.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Drops 5,000 Yuan in Five Days; Drops 1,000 Yuan Per Day; Nearly 10,000 Yuan Away from the Highest Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market experienced an unprecedented drop, and although the downward trend has not ceased, it has turned into a fluctuating situation. After breaking the 14,000 yuan mark twice, it rebounded.  The psychology of all parties has changed from fatigue to stability, due to the withdrawal of the American warship Yangtze River and rumors of a partial agreement between the United States and Japan. Therefore, securities firms emerged with 1,000 taels, and Shun Yuan, Yi Feng, and Cheng Ji each released 400-500 taels. It once retreated wildly from 15,350 yuan to 13,400 yuan.  At noon, rumors of bullish buying emerged, and gangs from Hong Kong and Chaozhou covered their short positions. Ming Feng advanced more than 500 taels. Shi He, Xiang Xing Yong, Xiang He, Tong Kang, Yong Ji, and banking groups entrusted securities firms to advance around 300 taels each. Later, the price fluctuated around 14,000 yuan, eventually settling down by a small 470 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was around 24,000 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Prices Fluctuate Nearly 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened at 9:00 AM at 15,100 yuan per bar (ten taels), 150 yuan higher than the closing price the previous night. Shi He, Xin Feng Yong, and remittance merchants came in to push up the price, raising it to 350 yuan. Soon, Shun Yuan and others suddenly dumped their holdings, causing a sell-off of nearly 1,000 yuan, dropping the price to 14,350 yuan. Xiang Xing Yong, Ming Feng, and remittance merchants advanced to raise the price by 500 yuan, reaching 14,850 yuan. With news of the Yangtze River warship's withdrawal, the selling pressure rose again. Remittance merchants returned, and Shun Yuan and Li Tai sold large quantities, intensifying the downward trend, and plunging another 1,450 yuan, dropping to 13,400 yuan. At noon, rumors of a partial compromise between the United States and Japan surfaced, and market sentiment turned firm. Xiang Xing Yong and Tian Yuan bought in, causing a rebound, rising 950 yuan. The market closed at noon, rising to 14,350 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, rising 450 yuan amidst the upward trend, reaching 14,800 yuan. Gong He and De Cheng advanced, rising to 14,950 yuan. It then fell again. Tian Yuan and Gong He sold heavily, plunging 1,200 yuan, dropping to 13,750 yuan. Finally, Ming Feng and remittance merchants vigorously advanced, pushing the price up by 730 yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 14,480 yuan, a further small decrease of 470 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been decreasing for five consecutive days, with a total drop of 5,050 yuan. The daily difference was 1,950 yuan. After the close, the price rose to 14,800 yuan. The marked price of gold shops was 15,000 yuan, selling 1,000 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold and Silver Prices Both Fall</p>
<p>The selling price of ornamental gold per tael in silver shops, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, initially decreased three times, dropping 130 yuan, to 1,400 yuan. At noon, it rebounded 70 yuan, and in the afternoon, it rose another 50 yuan, reaching 1,520 yuan, then suddenly fell to 1,450 yuan, and rebounded three times, rising 50 yuan, totaling 1,500 yuan (decreasing 150 yuan when taken in), still falling by a small 30 yuan. Fine silver was down 2 yuan, to 22 yuan, and the black market was down 1 yuan, totaling 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Rate Plunges; US Dollar Once Reaches 26 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the official rates of the Central Bank and HSBC did not change. The small counters of 14 foreign banks, including British and American banks, maintained stable prices. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies first plunged and then rebounded slightly, due to initial news of the withdrawal of the American Yangtze River Fleet, followed by rumors of a partial compromise between the United States and Japan. After the market opened in the morning, spot gold plunged, and the price of the US dollar fell to 25-26 yuan. Speculators sought to liquidate their remaining long positions, leading to a sudden drop. Banque de l'Indochine sold US$5,000-6,000 to a French import firm at a price of 3.75 yuan, and later it became even firmer, with no sellers at that price. HSBC offered to sell at 2s4 3/8d, and the decline stopped slightly at noon. Although no further transactions took place in the afternoon, the market softened slightly. The closing prices were 2s4 3/8d for the British pound and 3.625 yuan for the US dollar, an increase of 1/8d for the former and 2.5 yuan for the latter compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: the prices of British and American gold pounds each fell by 10 yuan. The price of British gold notes gradually stabilized, while the price of American gold notes once fell to 26 yuan, finally settling at 27.20 yuan, a decrease of 1.90 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of Hong Kong notes fell and then rebounded to par. The prices of Japanese and Korean gold notes both trended lower, with the former falling to 2.70 yuan and the latter dropping to 2.90 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 25th (Tuesday) Dispatch: This morning, the market opened flat. There were no changes in the London and New York telegraphic transfer rates. There were quotes but no market. The black market for "Joint Notes" also showed little fluctuation. The Shanghai exchange rate alone rose by 3.50 yuan, to 77.50 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th (Tuesday) Dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened steadily this morning. There were no gains or losses in the trading of various currencies.</p>

Among British company stocks, bank stocks mostly showed improvement, with Mercantile Bank rising by 2s 6d, to £9 7s 6d; HSBC (London Registered Shares) rising by £3, to £80; and HSBC (Hong Kong Registered Shares) rising by £1, to £86. Jardine Matheson also rose by 2s 6d, to £12 12s 6d. Only the Kailan Mining Administration shares fell by 6d, to 13s 6d. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>In the black market for public bonds, the market was slightly sluggish yesterday. Prices failed to break through the previous day's closing prices. In the afternoon, the price even broke through 70 yuan. Rumors were mixed, mostly bearish. Many long positions were liquidated, and some even switched from long to short. The general floating long positions showed a reluctance to compete. However, Category D stood out, possibly due to its lower speculative nature. The temporary trend may be small first and then large. In short, the negotiations between the United States and Japan will still be the deciding factor. Yesterday morning, Category C opened at 70 yuan and 6 jiao. From then on, the market gradually weakened. Multiple long positions were liquidated by Tong Yi and Ren Feng. Jiu Feng also sold. Tong Kang and Yi Zhong slightly replenished their positions. The market closed slightly lower by 2-3 jiao at noon. In the afternoon, Tong Yi continued to sell. Heng Kang, Ding Kang, and Sheng Da all sold. Sheng Xing seemed to have switched from long to short. Yi Tai also sold. The selling pressure in the market was heavy. Category C broke through 70 yuan, seeing a small price of 69 yuan and 7 jiao. Jiu Feng replenished its position. Lian He, Lian Yi, and Xie Xing Yuan slightly bought in. It then rebounded to above 70 yuan. The closing price resulted in a decrease of 3-6.5 jiao for various categories, except for Category D, which rose by 3 jiao. The trading volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading Transactions: 100 shares of China National Products Company, priced at 75 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce fluctuated greatly. The waves were particularly large throughout the day. It initially showed a stable trend in the morning, but then gradually trended downward. The noon close rebounded slightly. The afternoon trend was similar to the morning: initially rising and then falling. At the close, the prices partially recovered. As a result, although the prices of various stocks were significantly lower than the previous close, there were no signs of panic in the market.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Rise and Fall Suddenly; "Double Horse" Yarn Follows Closely</h3>
<p>Recently, the yarn market has been fluctuating wildly, with a wide range of ups and downs. This is due to the dramatic changes in gold prices, as well as the uncertain nature of the US-Japan negotiations, which unsettles speculators. The yarn market follows, with turbulent waves. However, actual transactions, of course, have been cut off since the ban. However, due to the blocked source of raw materials, the factory's production is bound to decrease. The highest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 2,565 yuan, and the low price was 2,380 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the price jumped wildly with the remaining price, to 2,560 yuan. Upon seeing the high price, those who had made profits sold out, and it loosened again to 2,440 yuan. However, there were large buyers, gradually rebounding to 2,525 yuan. The closing price was 1,515 yuan, and the market price was 2,520 yuan.</p>
<p>The "Double Horse" yarn market opened stably in the morning. The opening price was 2,530 yuan, and it soon rose to 2,565 yuan. However, there were slight sell-offs on the table at this high price. It hovered around 2,520-2,530 yuan for quite some time. Unexpectedly, a gold storm suddenly arose, and the downward trend was fierce. People's hearts were drawn into the vortex, and the selling pressure was strong. With claims that the atmosphere for peace was extremely strong, short sellers were very active. The market gradually opened and gradually declined, loosening straight to the low peak of 2,380 yuan. As it approached 12:00, the gold market suddenly rebounded, and the buying pressure in the yarn market followed, gradually rising to a closing price of 2,490 yuan. According to statistics, 3,400 bales were traded in half a day. Today, 60 pieces of Japanese yarn were transferred to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The gold and "Double Horse" futures market, in a volatile and slightly stable situation, continued to decline, with a complex mixture of gains and losses. The general public, whether long or short, had no ability to hold positions for long. In particular, the potential of sellers was such that whenever the trend softened, a major sell-off occurred. Therefore, the market was largely characterized by an easy-to-fall and difficult-to-rise trend. At the initial opening in the morning, the firm rise in factory orders led to an upstream buying pressure. The December contract opened at 2,580 yuan, a large increase of 80 yuan. However, rumors abounded, mostly bearish. Many long positions fluctuated, and the futures price fell sharply. The near-term once decreased to 2,410 yuan, with the January contract also decreasing to 2,415 yuan and the February contract also decreasing to 2,480 yuan. By the noon close, it gradually rose, with each month's futures only decreasing by 30-50 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still firm first and then weak, with the situation being relatively stable. Due to the buying of floating short positions and retail investors, the December contract closed at 2,470 yuan, down 30 yuan; the January contract closed at 2,525 yuan, down 35 yuan; and the February contract closed at 2,570 yuan, also down 45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Stalls</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is hindered by rumors, and transactions have come to a standstill. This is due to the repeated decline in margin and yarn prices. In addition, factories are silent and inactive, and can only remain in a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, although there are slight intentions to sell at a discount, there are no buyers. As a result, no transactions were heard of throughout the day. It is faintly heard that fine velvet is still unwilling to fall significantly, but the price of group velvet has already become inferior.</p>
<h3>Eastern Cloth Sales are Hopeless</h3>
<p>The Dongbu Stock Exchange's colored ball futures market opened steadily, but the market declined in the later session. The December closing price was 86.5 yuan, a decrease of 1.99 yuan. The January closing price was 89 yuan, a decrease of 2.5 yuan. However, the spot market, due to hopeless real sales, became increasingly loose. The opening price for the leading fine cloth factory orders was 93-94 yuan, but it fell all the way down to 89 yuan at the noon close. In the later session, it was heard that yarn prices had risen, rebounding to 91 yuan at the close, but it was still 3.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The Four Gentlemen serge opened at 3.4 yuan, fell to 3.24 yuan, and the final closing price was 3.33 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour and Edible Oil are Both Seeking to Sell; the Coarse Grain Market is Reorganized</h3>
<p>There were few transactions of foreign flour in the early market, and influenced by the sluggishness of the previous night and the rice market, those with floating profits were all seeking to sell. Due to the lack of strong demand from merchants, the Eastern pier's transshipment flour formally opened lower at 48 yuan. Later, some practical sales took advantage of the low price, adding half a yuan, to 48.5 yuan. With the practical sales consultant from the Western pier, the price also ranged from 37 to 38 yuan. The market generally showed a stable trend. There was also a lack of movement in bran and wheat. Today, 9,500 bags of flour packaged on the new Beijing ship were transferred to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The Coarse Grain and Oil Cake market was taken over by the reorganized Coarse Grain Association yesterday afternoon. Therefore, there were only morning transactions, and few transactions took place in the afternoon. Due to active selling by scattered hoarders, edible oil prices fell by 5 to 10 yuan. Feidou also fell by 3-4 yuan due to loose selling in the goods. Corn remained relatively stable. In total, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 300 dan of Qingyou from the Dayou factory, 100 dan of rapeseed oil, 100 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Taishan factory, 70 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua factory, more than 600 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, 200 bags of green beans, and 500 bags of spot corn were sold. The futures volume was more than 100 tons. Regarding arrivals, the French company's Los Angeles ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, transporting 1,634 tons of corn from Haiphong, totaling 16,500 bags, which were unloaded at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou.</p>
<p>With no market for foreign rice, and with talk of a limited price of 150 yuan for domestic rice, buyers are hesitant, and the market has completely stalled again.</p>
<h3>Sugar Futures Fall to the Limit and Rise to the Limit in One Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market initially fell due to the peaceful atmosphere and the decline in spot gold and cotton yarn. Therefore, futures and spot raw white sugar both fell into the 200 yuan range. Due to the limit down in raw sugar futures, and with the sudden news in the afternoon that Dutch ships would reduce their voyages to the Far East, prices rebounded. The highest and lowest fluctuations differed by more than 30 yuan, showing how extreme the fluctuations were. The company's raw sugar futures for the end of the month fell to 187 yuan in the morning, and the December 10th contract fell to 199 yuan, both hitting the limit down. The black market price was 177 yuan to 187 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rumor of Dutch ships reducing their voyages to the Far East, the contract for the end of this month rose to 190 yuan and 197 yuan, also hitting the limit up. The December 10th contract was initially 187 yuan in the afternoon, then rose to 214 yuan to 219 yuan, also hitting the limit up. The subsequent black market prices were 200 yuan to 193 yuan, and 210 yuan. For spot goods, the November import of 24 grade raw white sugar was 209 yuan, 200 yuan, and 190 yuan in the morning, and 196 yuan, 209 yuan, and 6 yuan in the afternoon. The October goods were 208 yuan, 200 yuan, and 189 yuan in the morning, and 195 yuan in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Female Employees</h3>
<p>— Pingye</p>
<p>The intermittent news about the postal service suspending female employees has been published for almost a year. Because of the distance and barriers, we are still ashamed that we have not been able to fully understand the real reason for this move. When the examination and appointment of female employees was suspended, the women's community asked the Directorate General of Posts to explain the reasons. The Directorate General of Posts made a statement saying that married female employees are inconvenient to travel over mountains and rivers, so the examination and appointment were suspended (something to that effect; I have not seen the original text). Recently, at a meeting of the National参政会, there was the following news: "Female参政员 Chen Yiyun questioned why the postal service was discriminating against female employees and suspending the employment of married female employees, and said that this move was inconsistent with the meaning of increasing the population. Kong Geng also said that if married female employees were suspended, it would be inhumane. In fact, it can only restrict female employees from getting married, but it cannot restrict female employees from falling in love, and remedies should be sought." The words of Chen and Kong are directed at reality and have a common ground. Their straightforwardness also has its facts.</p>
<p>When men talk about women's rights, it is the same as when women talk about men's rights. If you are not thinking about the other party's rights, it is better to remain silent. Freedom is freedom insofar as it does not infringe on the freedom of others, and equality is equality insofar as it does not infringe on the equality of others. I don't want to say anything about the right and wrong of this issue. I only want to examine the reasons for this issue. As for the conclusion, I am waiting for the era to make its fair judgment!</p>
<p>Perhaps what the post office says about married female employees not being able to endure the journey is not just referring to their physical fitness, because physical fitness must be checked. I think what they are referring to is that if married female employees become pregnant, they will have the suffering of not being able to endure the journey. This statement has not been seen in the fragmented news. I am just assuming this. If this is the meaning, I acknowledge that it has its difficulties, but this is accidental. At least the局方's explanation is not sufficient.</p>
<p>As for the women's community, striving for equality is of course beyond reproach, but it would be best if married female employees can absolutely have no problem with the局方's transfers. Otherwise, they should find a way to solve this factual difficulty of the局方.</p>
<p>We have also seen female employees serving in any public institution in the past, and some have achieved good results, while others inevitably have the label of "vase". However, in this great era, women's bravery has its unique manifestations. This past perception of "vase" should be discarded. In order to strive for true gender equality, women should seek equality in service and equality in treatment through equality in knowledge and equality in education.</p>
<p>The post office may not permanently refuse to employ married female employees, and married female employees may not regard whether or not they are employed by the post office as an honor or disgrace. Moreover, the post office's suspension of the employment of married female employees is not a fundamental issue of gender equality, but only a temporary factual issue. We look forward to an early resolution.</p>
<h3>Amidst Calls for Expanded Price Controls, Earnestly Hoping for Sanctions Against the Rampant "House Weevils"</h3>
<p>— Cao Wenhai</p>
<p>Now that the authorities of the two concessions have demonstrated their determination to implement their policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, they certainly will not be satisfied with what has been achieved so far. Millions of citizens in Shanghai are also earnestly hoping that the authorities, adhering to the principle of protecting the populace and maintaining public order, will provide the citizens with full assistance and order the "house weevils" (large landlords and sub-landlords) to voluntarily reduce rents.</p>
<p>A large landlord has intensified his oppression of tenants. My close friend, Mr. Zhao, rented a dilapidated double-structure residence on Rue Gallieni in the French Concession before the war. The "house weevil" is a Ningbo native who started in the construction industry. At that time, both parties agreed that the monthly rent would be seventy yuan, and the landlord would be responsible for repairing any damage to the house. In the first year or two after moving in, there was one repair. However, after the August 13th Incident, in the summer of the following year, the roof was damaged and leaking, and several walls were also on the verge of collapse. He sent a letter to the landlord requesting repairs, but received no response. Not only did the landlord not instruct a mason to repair the building, but in mid-January, he suddenly received a lawyer's letter demanding a 30% increase in rent per month. If Mr. Zhao did not agree to the increase, he would be required to terminate the lease and move out by the end of the year. Mr. Zhao had no way to argue and had to agree to the increase. Unexpectedly, after the rent increase, the landlord still did not instruct craftsmen to repair the leaks, and less than three months later, at the beginning of [Year Omitted] eighteen, he received another letter from the rental agent demanding an increase in water fees of twelve yuan per building. Subsequently, letters arrived one after another, demanding either an increase in rent or an increase in water fees, and even threatening to stop the water supply, forcing the tenants to install their own water meters and bear the water costs themselves. After several negotiations, this was dropped. However, in early spring of this year, due to the excessive damage to the roof, he notified the landlord to instruct craftsmen to repair the house. The rental agent replied in a letter saying that all repairs were the responsibility of the tenants themselves. Unexpectedly, in mid-June, the rental agent sent another letter saying: "The land price in this city is rising daily, and all expenses attached to the lease, as well as various taxes, are constantly increasing. We have no choice but to increase the rent by 50% from July 1st, and charge an additional ten yuan per building per month for tap water." They also added: "If your tenants ignore the water fee portion before the 10th of the month, the agency will no longer be responsible for paying the water fee in the future. In the event of water cuts or other accidents, we will not be liable." The oppression of tenants by large landlords has intensified to this extreme. I am afraid that Mr. Zhao is not the only one among the millions of citizens in Shanghai.</p>
<p>There are countless sub-landlords who take advantage of the situation, adding to the suffering of Shanghai citizens by subletting houses for a living. In these extraordinary times, they spare no effort in exploiting the sub-tenants (i.e., lodgers). Before, renting a single-structure house cost forty or fifty yuan, and a double-structure house cost only sixty or seventy yuan. They partition the houses, build lofts, and create spaces resembling pigeon coops, and then sublet them to third-level tenants. A厢房 (side room) rents for one hundred and twenty yuan, a 客堂樓 (living room upstairs) rents for eighty or ninety yuan, a 亭子間 (small room) rents for forty or fifty yuan, and the rents for the upper lofts, third-level lofts, and 灶披間 (kitchen shed) altogether amount to around four hundred yuan. After deducting monthly expenses of around one hundred yuan for rent, house tax, and utility bills, excluding the self-use of the living room, sun deck, and 亭子間, they can still net a profit of over two hundred yuan, reaping benefits without any effort. If the large landlord increases the rent, for example, by 10%, the "house weevil" will increase the rent for the "lodgers" by 30%. Even those who are more reasonable will increase it by 10%. However, the 10% increase for the large landlord is only seven yuan, while the increase for the "lodgers" by the sub-landlord is perhaps thirty or forty yuan. Moreover, with the increase in water, electricity, and tax expenses, the "house weevils" take the opportunity to arbitrarily increase them, creating an extra source of income. Countless third-level tenants are forced to move out because they cannot afford the exorbitant rents. There are also some cunning "house weevils" who use houses as tools for extortion, plastering the entrances of lanes with red slips advertising rentals and sublets, luring those looking for houses into their trap. They require a deposit of half or two-thirds of the rent in advance, and then discuss the terms of the lease. If the prospective tenant does not agree, the deposit is confiscated. Even if the matter is negotiated and the deposit is returned, only three or four-tenths of it is returned.</p>
<p>In the past four or five years, the rampant, tyrannical, and oppressive behavior of Shanghai's "house weevils," who are causing suffering to their fellow citizens, is no less than that of the "rice tigers." This is intolerable. It is earnestly hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will rescue the "lodgers" from the depths of misery and allow them to live in peace. This is a matter of utmost urgency. However, I must also earnestly advise those who are "lodgers" that Shanghai is a place where people from all over come together, and there are both good and bad people. Not all "sub-landlords" are lawless. Matters must be discussed fairly. However, there are also some third-level tenants who are excessive, such as deliberately owing rent, leaving the lights on all night, ironing clothes privately, and using several basins of clean water to wash a single towel. These behaviors must also be improved. (Editor's Note: Rent arrears are now extremely rare. Most "landlords" turn off the main power switch at night, which poses a great danger in terms of preventing theft, fire, and water damage. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention to this.)</p>
<h3>A Call to Suppress House Rents</h3>
<p>— Su Yuebo</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: I read a letter from Mr. Li Zhenzhi in the "Chunqiu" column on the 19th and felt the same pain. I am not alone in this feeling; I am afraid that 99% of all tenants in Shanghai share this sentiment. Compatriots who have come to Shanghai to seek refuge from the suffering of the occupied areas are all making temporary plans, hoping to prolong their lives a little. Compatriots who originally resided in Shanghai and held property rights or lease rights should, in this time of national crisis, help those in need and fulfill their duties as citizens. Instead, they are taking advantage of the opportunity to profit, extorting in every possible way, and making a fortune off the national crisis, which is truly unforgivable. Especially the sub-landlords, who rent houses for only thirty or forty yuan to one hundred yuan per building per month, rent out a living room for one or two hundred yuan, and a 亭子間 for fifty or sixty yuan. This is shocking and against the law. All tenants in Shanghai should unite and appeal to the authorities to set limits on house prices so that the evil landlords can no longer exploit us. This is the best course of action. Otherwise, it will be in vain. ... Respectfully,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Su Yuebo</p>
<h3>Hero on the Roof</h3>
<p>— Lao Ni Zuo</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Shui Mao</p>
<p>A certain sub-landlord purchased a coffin four years ago for eighty-seven yuan. It now sells for one thousand two hundred and forty yuan, making it one thousand one hundred and fifty-three yuan cheaper. The sub-landlord was overjoyed. However, considering that renting out the space occupied by the coffin could yield thirty yuan per month, totaling one thousand four hundred and forty yuan over four years, the sub-landlord would actually lose two hundred and eighty-seven yuan. The sub-landlord couldn't help but turn from laughter to tears.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fourteen - The Life of a Street Performer</p>
<p>Begonia, holding two pieces of rock candy, stood behind the fourth person, his heart pounding unexpectedly. His cough persisted, and the rock candy had failed to work its usual magic.</p>
<p>He began to worry that his physical strength might not be up to the task today.</p>
<p>When it was his turn to go out, he originally wanted to take a few more steps and then do a somersault, which would save him some energy. Unexpectedly, he panicked and his mind went blank. As soon as he went out, he used too much force, and his body flipped two or three feet high. When he landed, everything immediately turned black, and he suddenly tasted a sweetness on the root of his tongue that he had never experienced before. Then he fainted.</p>
<p>He didn't know how they helped him off the stage, or how they sent him home and laid him on the couch like a dead man. All he knew was that when he opened his weary eyes again, he saw Mei Bao standing in front of the bed, crying like a river, holding a bowl of medicine in her right hand, shaking more violently than someone with malaria.</p>
<p>"Ah!" He sighed without a sound. (272) (End of Chapter 14)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Also Watches "Foggy Chongqing"</h3>
<p>— Tan Sui</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai Drama Art Society could perform it, the Huaguang Drama Art School took the lead and premiered "Foggy Chongqing" at the Russian Art Theatre.</p>
<p>The plot, from beginning to end, constantly lingered in a solemn atmosphere. Whether it was the little hotel in the second act or the lavish life in the villa in the third act, it was all the same. This is a well-known fact to the public in the face of the times. The playwright was indeed able to hold the attention of the general audience, and especially because it contained a profound sense of condemnation, it made the audience deeply feel it in the unspoken explanations.</p>
<p>The fall of Sha Zhanxiong, the death of Old He, the confusion of Lin Shulan, Hu Huiling's role as a physiognomist, Lu Min's unwillingness to be a primary school teacher, and Xu Manli's dishonorable life - were these all out of their own free will? No, they all wanted to have their proper lives and proper futures, but because they were all driven to struggle on the brink of starvation and were eager to find a way out, they all inevitably went down the wrong path. Only Lu Min and Old He were exceptions.</p>
<p>In this performance, the personalities of the actors were very suitable for the characters in the play. The dialogue and actions were just right, except that the female lead, Lin Shulan, spoke too fast when she spoke quickly, and too slowly when she spoke slowly, and the male lead, Sha Zhanxiong, spoke a little too softly. But what I found most lovable and pitiable was Mr. Lu Min, who was first a waiter, then a primary school teacher, and later introduced to Sha Zhanxiong as a servant by his wife. He never wanted to change his scholarly nature, that is, he always had to say "firstly," "secondly," and "thirdly" in an essay-like manner. When his wife scolded him: "You go to be a primary school teacher who can't get enough to eat and won't starve to death, tighten your pants and go listlessly to the classroom to mislead the children. It's better to be a servant crisply and cleanly!" Aren't these few sentences enough to move me, a person who also lives off chalk dust?</p>
<p>On the way home on the first night, attacked by the dark and cold wind, I felt that I was coming back with a full "satisfaction."</p>
<h3>Past and Present of Bai Yuwei</h3>
<p>— Chang Mei</p>
<p>The actress Bai Yuwei is a graduate of the Peking Opera School. Her appearance, voice, stage presence, and tone are all excellent. During her school days, the Qingyi teacher Wu Fuqin and Lu Peifang taught her Qingyi plays, such as "June Snow," "Mulberry Garden Meeting," "Teaching the Son," and "Wujiapo." Later, she also received personal instruction from Cheng Yanqiu on famous plays such as "Mandarin Duck Tomb" and "Jasper Hairpin," which she performed just like her teacher. After the opera school disbanded, she transferred to the Guanghua Society to help perform charity plays in Tianjin for two months, returning with praise. After returning to Peking, she worked hard and diligently, and further practiced 蹻工 (foot binding dance) and 把子 (stage combat) with famous teachers. She also learned Kunqu from Han Shichang and Hou Yuyou, and Huashan plays from Zhu Ruxiang and Hao Jieqing. She never stopped for a year, and her art made rapid progress. She has repeatedly performed in public with famous actors in Peking, and her reputation has greatly increased. According to friends in Peking, the actress Bai is intelligent by nature, and she is also innocent and lively. In addition to learning opera, she likes to study and try to understand literature. She was especially good at English in elementary school. This time, she will appear in "Chunjin" with Li Shaochun, and it is certain that the red flowers and green leaves will complement each other wonderfully. Both of them are talented in both civil and military arts and are not blocked by Kunqu or other forms of opera.</p>

<h3>The Jade Garden in a Rain of Blood</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: At Dusk, the Hu Cavalry Filled the City with Dust</p>
<p>The Ao River was very wide, the river water rippling, the wild wind whistling. There was no moonlight in the sky, only many stars, flickering and shining with faint light. Looking into the distance, the lights on the opposite bank were dense, as if they were heavily guarded. Knowing that as long as there was any movement here, they would immediately intercept from the other side, so they lay still. Seeing the stars change position in the sky, it was already the second half of the night, Zhang Cangqiu suddenly saw several places on the opposite bank emitting white smoke, gradually tongues of fire burst out, the red light reflecting the sky, and the sound of people clamoring. Zhang Cangqiu knew that Xu Jing and others had successfully attacked and that he should go to meet them. Not daring to be careless, he immediately urged Chen Fei to lead his soldiers, build a pontoon bridge, cross the river, and launch a surprise attack. Although there were bandits blocking them, their strength was already scattered. Zhang Cangqiu and others had already strongly crossed the Xiluo River and rushed ashore together. At this time, Xu Jing and Liu Yining were already engaged in a bloody battle on the west bank of the Luo River, which was extremely intense. Because Bai Xianzong received the order from San Gui, he knew that Xu Jing and Liu Yining could be the vanguard, so he summoned the two to his tent, instructed them, and ordered them to lead two thousand people to set off at dusk, detour to the shallow part of the Xiluo River downstream, and launch a surprise attack on the bandits. After the two were ordered to withdraw, Liu Yining smiled at Xu Jing and said: "In the great battle of Yipianshi the other day, Brother Zhang showed his skills on the battlefield, but I was unable to gallop much. This time we have the order to secretly cross the Luo River, and we must achieve our goal. I think Zhang Cangqiu and others will definitely respond at the same time. I want to take this opportunity to kill more bandits." Xu Jing said: "Brother Liu is right. Your skills are no less than Brother Zhang's, and I am willing to follow behind you and kill the bandits together." (228)</p>
