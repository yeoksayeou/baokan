<h3>美國政策的演進</h3>
<p>後世研究世界歷史的人，讀到有關今天的這一章，一定最注意美國的動靜；他是目前的世界重心，他近來種種舉措和表示，實是決定目前世界發展的因素。</p>
<p>美國的基本政策並無改變，但其政策的重心却在向前推進之中。析言之：以前的重心在「維持條的尊嚴」，現在的重心在「堅實的擁護自由與民治」。在這兩者之間，有過一個頓挫：即一九三一年日本侵佔東三省，英外相西門拒絕合作制裁日本；其後經過慕尼黑會議的最高峯，一直到歐戰的爆發為止；孤立主義者利用了國際的逆流，强調的主張着重西半球的保衛，對歐洲的一切糾紛，不加過問；甚至極端的主張同時退出遠東，放棄菲律賓羣島。掩護這一頓挫的口號，高唱着：「保持美國不牽進戰爭的漩渦！」而形成這一頓挫的心理，一方面是對英國決心的極端不信任。另一方面，又是對蘇聯用心的根本懷疑；這一心理，在一九三九年歐戰爆發的時候，流露其最高峯。孤立主義派在那時候的聲勢，幾乎壓倒一切：像林德伯上校那樣公然替德義代言的人，居然也打動過許多人的心弦。法國崩潰也是恰逢其會。但看總統羅斯福氏當時答復法國總理萊諾氏最後呼籲，除了允許竭力支持外，不得不鄭重聲明：「以不加入戰爭為限」；可見羅氏當時如何苦心孤詣啊！</p>
<p>然而美國經過這一頓挫之後，終於勇往直前，發揮其基本政策的光輝。原來美國對於國際，以一八二三年的「門羅宣言」為基礎；即是所謂「從此以後，美洲決不再為歐洲殖民的對象」，禁止歐洲列强干涉或過問美洲的事務。這在某一角度觀察之下，應視為消極的方面，而不應視為美國國際政策的全貌。因為美洲永遠不能孤立於世界之外。第一决世界大戰的參戰，確是為了美國而參戰，為了美洲而參戰，這是顯著的事理。故美國對於戰後的國際，他運用其政策於兩個條的之上：一個是一九一九年的「凡爾賽和約」，另一個是一九二入年的「非戰公約」；根據和約，他反對片面破壞現狀的違的行為；根據公的，他又發起了種種裁减軍備及和平解決國際爭端的會議。特別對於亞洲，他又於一九二三年發起在華盛頓締結了「九國公的」；根據這個條的，牠竭力擁護中國領土主權的完整，堅持「門戶開放政策」，而不承認暴力侵略的領土變動，即是九國公的的演繹。這三項條的，是美國國際政策的積極方面；亦即美國國策重心所寄的「維持條的尊嚴」的基調所在</p>
<p>美國以「維持條的尊嚴」為政策重心，是永遠不會改變的，但是法國崩潰了之後，美國國民由所受刺激與敎訓，由所感威脅與危機，瞿然於僅僅保持這一重心是不夠的，於是向前推進了。第一步是以太批軍備武器向英國輸送，同時，自身也就開始建立武裝。這在政治方面的形態，則有孤立派的自然漸趨落沒，而强硬派的史汀生與諾克斯等人聯袂起任要職。是美加聯防、以及租借英國根據地，亦即自動担負了英帝國防務的一部。由事實上解釋這第二步的對象，可謂完全在於竭力援助英國這一點上。及至德義日正式宣佈同盟，反證了美國僅僅援助英國一國還是不夠；顯明的見得美國當前的問題，確是並非援助別人了；此其當然的推論，當然的趨歸，有如美國前任駐法大使布立德在三國同盟移發表演說時所說：「我們是吾能有充足時間，去充實國防，大半要靠英國抵抗納粹於歐洲。中國抵抗日本於亞洲，，而中英之能吾抵抗到底，却又決之於我們接濟的程度和速度。」在這樣認識下，有其第三步；即對中英兩國同時進行其有計劃的大規模的援助；滇緬公路開放及英美對中國放借鉅款等等，於是先後出現了。逐步進展，蓋有其一貫的意義；而其現階段的綱目，則如羅斯福年底的爐邊談話所明白申述的：（一）反對新秩序」（二）援助中英，擊潰德義日，以期美國的避免戰禍，（三）如遇必要，美國有一戰的決心。歸納綱目，求其重心，則在「堅實的擁護自由與民治」。</p>
<p>現在美國政策的積極性，已經完滿長成。他以巨人全副武裝的雄姿，站在三盟的對面。決心粉碎德義日瓜分及統制世界折迷夢！</p>

<p>歐戰痛史（八）</p>
<h3>英法陳綫零亂回憶</h3>
<p>他站在辦公桌前，昂首向上，兩手挿入衣袋。從此一別，竟未與他再晤。</p>
<p>次日，我由軍事長官接見，覺得他們較為樂觀。他們對於沿索末河埃斯河防綫作縱深配備的法軍士氣，讚揚備至，據他們吿訴我，魏剛將軍已決心不去構成一條連綿不斷的防綫，必要時，他將聽任敵軍戰車衝過防錢，而力守兩旁據點，務使敵軍步兵砲隊不能跟隨戰車衝進。不幸我們最精銳的師團，已在北部一戰，全郁犧牲，因此新防綫的兵力，比較五月十日還要單薄。</p>
<p>六月二日，德機兩百四十架轟炸巴黎。英國情報部大臣特夫古柏，就在那天飛到巴黎，法國情報部長福祿沙的他午餐，我亦被邀奉陪。地點在列茲飯店，我們方纔坐定，警報忽然大作。侍者們恪守防空規則，一霎時都躱到地窖中去了。那時部長和隨員，眞是進退兩難啼笑皆非。耍躱起來吧，未免太無勇氣，要自己動手吧，又似乎有損尊嚴。他們祇好枯坐不動，眼望着空空如也的杯盤，耳聽着怒吼不絕的砲火。可恨德機故意為難，警報久不解除，他們飢腸轆轆，談話也因之索然無味。一位秘書打電話到警察局詢問，所接得的報吿說，「形勢非常嚴重。兵工廠巳被炸彈擊中，航空部已經起火，死傷的已有好幾百人。」</p>
<p>我回到家中，孩子們都爭着吿訴我說，他們親眼看見德機飛翔高空，像一羣蜜蜂，在日光之下，時隱時現。巴黎對於這决轟炸，似乎並不恐慌。因此我得一個結論，德機威脅，決不若外傳的可怕。第二天消息傳來，德軍沿索末和埃斯兩河前綫的新攻勢已經發動。英軍總司令戈特將軍和他的部下都已撤離法國。此時我改在英國空軍方面服役。</p>
<p>這時候英國空軍司令部設在晚洛埃地方，我由空軍副司令普萊法將軍延見。假使你對於英國空軍軍官見得多些，必會因他們面目過分相似而吃驚。他們漂亮的面龐，蔚藍的眼睛，雖然頭髮斑白，依然露着朝氣，態度溫柔，性情剛毅果敢，舉動有醴，恪遵紀律，這都是英國空軍的特色。</p>
<p>普萊法將軍對我說，「德國空軍雖然在數量上超過我們，但在質的方面顯然不及我們。他們的損失要比我們高出三四倍，因此目下的情勢，已比戰事初起時好得多了。」</p>
<p>我在特洛埃附近看見英國精銳的旋風式飛機兩隊，和十九歲上下的靑年隊員數名，他們有着棕色的頭髮，藍色的眼睛，各有擊落敵機十次以上的勝利記錄，雖是人機優秀，但我對於飛機數量之少，仍不免駭異。英國在法國的飛機不過幾隊，至少在我視察的那個區域內如此。我回至巴黎時，即到敵軍機械化部隊巳抵盧盎近郊的惡劣消息，便把我的感想向上司希弗上校陳述說，我想貴國在國內，一定還有不少戰鬥機。我們必須把他們派遣到法國，此刻將要決定的，不僅是法國的命運，也是英國的命運呀！」</p>
<p>他回答說，「你必須到英倫一行，在無綫電中向英國人民呼　，</p>
<p>英國輿情對於法國處境的危殆，尙未十分明瞭呀！」</p>
<p>「上校，我固然很高興去，但必須奉令而行纔好。」</p>
<p>「關於這一點，我可以向司令部去說。」</p>
<p>司令派赫孟德上尉來，我與他經過一番商量，便決定在六月十日乘軍用飛機飛往倫教。可是軍情日益不利。最後，德國戰車巳直迫巴黎近郊了。政府始終說誓必死守京城，但在六月九日那天，我路過海軍部門首，却看見水兵們正在裝載巨大的蓬車。</p>
<p>六月十日淸晨七時，馬奇利打電話來，勸我不如把家眷送往南方。</p>
<p>我問他，「政府要遷都嗎」</p>
<p>「就在今天。」</p>
<p>「巴黎不是要死守的嗎？」</p>
<p>「不是了。」</p>
<p>道時我如聞晴天霹靂，知道一切都完了。法國失了巴黎，不啻有身無首，戰事已是失敗定了。</p>
<p>我應在中午時分，到達布克飛機塲。我們夫婦兩人，決往平素最愛的巴黎一角，作最後的留連。凡是各處有名的地方，我們一一向之道別。我們覺得巴黎城市從未有過這樣的美麗：天晴無雲，空氣柔和，馬路上的交通警察照常指揮車輛，似乎世界並未臨到末日。百貨商店中的女子售貨員，依然慇懃招待顧客。每個人的眼匯中雖然含着一包熱淚，各人依然照常辦事，絕口不談這幕大悲劇。</p>
<p>我的內人說，「法國平民眞偉大呀！他們質樸勇敢，兼而有之。像道樣的人民，怎麼會戰敗呢？」</p>
<p>我答道，「血肉之軀怎能抵得過機器。他們奉令防守戰綫，自應遵令防守，可是防綫從米受到攻擊，敵軍已抄到後面，把他們包圍了。」</p>
<p>她說，「我總不相信德軍會攻入巴黎……」</p>
<p>幾天以前，我們的至友馬脫爾軍醫曾與我們縱談德軍若果聞入巴黎的事。他對我們說，「我已下了決心：一聽見敵人入城的消息，就立刻拔劍自殺。」接着他又解釋一般人都不懂怎樣自殺，以致弄得半死不活，但是軍醫用槍却像使用解剖刀一樣靈巧，總是適中要害萬無一失。」他又半正經牛玩笑的說，「假使你們也不願意活下去，我很可以代勞…」</p>
<p>當晚十點鐘，我已乘機飛往英國，我的內人還在憂容滿面，檢理隨身携帶的雜物，忽然電話鈴饗，使她停住手。</p>
<p>那人就是馬脫爾。他說，「我要知道你和莫樂先生是吾仍在巴黎。」</p>
<p>她答道，「他巳奉命飛往倫敦，我在明天黎明，也要離開巴黎了。」</p>
<p>他的聲調有些異樣，說道「我要離去了，但是路程要比你們遠得多呀……」　，我的內人突然想起他的談話知道他正要自殺，就想勸他改變初衷。她說，「你還有許多事可以做呢。你的病人，你的助手，你的看護，都要你招顧呀……」</p>
<p>馬脫爾說，「我不能再活下去了。我只有一個兒子，已在上次大戰中陣亡。我一直自信他是為拯救法國捐軀，而聊以自慰。現在法國又要失去了。我賴以苟延殘喘的每一事物，都要捨我而去。我實在不能再活下去了。」</p>
<p>她還想勸吿時，他已把電話掛斷了。</p>
<p>後來在六月二十五日，我妻所乘的快船在阿曹亞略停，讀到美國報紙載着馬脫爾已在德軍開入巴黎之時，注射番不　素自殺的消息。</p>
<p>馬脫爾之死，使我們喪失了一個知己，使法國喪失了一個最高尙的人物。這位軍醫眞是一個君子人。他積攢的錢財都用以維持他的免費診所，經他在那裏施行刀圭的人，不知凡幾。我知道他曾用他獨到的手術把一向嫉妒他懷恨他已有多年的仇人，從死中救活。他曾千百次表現過他在身心上所具備的道德的勇氣。像他這樣勇士，竟不願偷生苟活，亦可為法國遭逢的大不幸所引起的大混亂，作一寫照了。</p>
<p>聯軍沿着維曼大道，從法蘭德退却時，有一法國農婦，在門口目擊難民接連不斷的經過，便慘然向我說道：</p>
<p>「眞可憐啊，上尉！這樣一個泱泱大國……」</p>
<p>其後獲得馬脫爾的死耗，要輪到我說「眞可」了。法國要製造或購買五千輛戰車，一萬架飛機，本是輕而易舉，只為因循苟且，不能及時造成，遂使如此人物，啣恨九原，如此文化，橫遭摧殘，一念及此，能不令人痛忿欲在。（完）</p>

<h3>納稅人會明日舉行　加捐案將起爭辯　英日僑均提嚴竣修正案　各方盼能否決加捐原議</h3>

<h3>美國名女作家　史特朗　過滬返美</h3>
<p>昨晚抵滬之塔虎脫總統號輪之旋客中、最引人注意者、為美國名女作家之史特朗女士（Miss　Anna　Louis　Strong）史氏最近由渝赴港附乘此輪過滬返美、在渝時曾晋謁蔣委員長及華政府高級當局、據談、重慶之行、所得印象極深、中國軍民精神、異常旺盛、其實中國民衆百分之九十九、皆竭力主張作戰到底</p>
<p>此種精神、必能使中國獲得最後之勝利、史氏前曾來華考察多次、以其在華搜集之材料、寫成「中國的四萬萬人」「及五分之一人口」兩書、赴渝前、會在蘇聯游歷多時、據謂蘇聯已準備一切應付事變之措置、但力求中立、不願參加歐洲戰爭、然以遠東方面之戰爭而論、則蘇聯已支持中國</p>
<p>日本欲以互不侵犯協定爲餌、誘蘇聯停止以各種軍火及原料等援華、全屬幻想、蓋蘇德與蘇日之關係完全不同也、據史氏之觀察、目前中蘇兩國友誼堅固、一如中國之與英美然、日本之局勢、現甚危急、因邊處中蘇英美四國包圍之中、如不懸崖勒馬、速變外交政策、則其前途堪慮</p>
<p>史氏於去年六月到德國考察、留德數星期、轉往莫斯科、在蘇聯逗留數月、始至重慶、足跡遍歐亞、大勢自熟悉、上項觀察係以實際經騐為依據、表示中國國際局勢之有利及作戰前途之光明、史氏在滬躭擱一晝夜、定於今日下午六時半搭原輪返美、先在舊金山考察、然後赴華盛頓紐的、</p>

<p>洋米連日不斷到滬、已迭誌本　、昨日怡和洋行裕生輪由香港裝來一萬五千三百八十七包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、閒本月內、尙有大批越米裝法輪由西貢直接運來、緬米亦有大量約出月可到、（祖）</p>
<p>厚　　等國米、到貨雖稀、　銷塲亦遜、貨主亟謀脫書之下、市面頓見軟局、若常幫原白粳、開百零七元半、崑山原包白粳百零五元、斛見百零四元、次至百零一元、青角原包薄稻百零一元、青角九十八元半、九十七元半、</p>

<h3>粉市結束　洋粉存底廿三萬包</h3>
<p>粉市已呈結束景象、蓋以年關在即、各方均從事結束、雜糧公會市塲、交易已達最後一天、故現粉實銷、僅本街急於需用者購備外、其餘投機買賣、六都均已了結、執貨者亦均擬待守明年紅盤再做、故市面脚地堅穩、計開花鳥　樓牌　粉一萬包左右、價由二十四元三角五分、開盤步升至六角、香港新到之藍嘜花洋粉價做二十四元四角、尙有新到兵船牌洋粉喊價二十四元三角、但未做開、聞此次岳州輪運到洋粉一萬包內、兵船粉祗有二千包、其餘均為藍嘜花、目下該牌已得本街方面之樂購、聞後批來源、逐有運到、查滬市洋粉存底各牌併計約二十三萬包、今日起雜糧公會寒假停市、至一月三十一日照常開業、</p>
<p>小麥市况、沉静已久、年終結束將屆、國內外來源久寂、所有存貨、大都關住不脫、待守明正紅盤再開、聞滬市租界存棧無錫常州等麥僅二千包之數、日廠與華廠存麥、亦僅敷一月之需用、故麥市前途、自屬漲易而難跌、</p>
<h3>雜項活猪湧到　肉價大跌</h3>
<p>今年肉價之貴、亦異尋常、因猪來自江北青勝港及黃港一帶、受到種種影響、橫徵暴歛、亦有把持　縱、因之大衆吃「自然素齋」、屏除肉食、不料邇來毛猪到數甚夥、一則畜猪人家急於售現、以應年用、紛將猪隻出賣運滬、鮮肉拆價在冬至節時、最高售每担二百四十元、嗣因銷路不振、行盤下跌至每担二百元、現滬上活猪所存有近萬隻、鮮肉行盤已跌至每担一百六七十元、但零售肉價、則以年節關係、各肉店猶不肯削低、</p>

<h3>理髪與洗澡</h3>
<p>— 高揚</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>早晨，拿起粥碗，媽就囑咐我，「蓀，你的頭髮實太長了，像「長毛」似的，怪難看，今天去剃掉了吧！」</p>
<p>「噢，姆媽，今天下來，校裹可以空些了，下午去剃好了！」</p>
<p>說着，「　六　六」的吃完兩碗稀飯，挾起報紙走了。</p>
<p>路上，經過「理髮店」門口，牌門板關得老緊，外面貼上一張條子，說是「朋友們（即理髮匠）耍求增加薪水，停止營業數天，一俟，……」</p>
<p>可是，同一條路上，另外一家却已經「開張」了。黑叢叢的長頭髪朋友在往裹頭攢。</p>
<p>雖然，自己是「長毛」，但還是趕到校裏去要緊。</p>
<p>忙了一天，五點半鐘，又趕着回家，一天的時間，在不知不覺中從手裏溜走了。一到家，媽又催着去剃頭了。</p>
<p>其實，我對這「玩意兒」眞感到麻煩，憑空去化掉一個多鐘點，來坐在椅子上享受。不過，要是幾千幾寓人加起來的損失，這時間的統計恐怕就有着一個驚人的數字吧！但是，為了不使別人討厭，是還得修飾一下的。</p>
<p>一進剃頭店，裏面擠滿了人。</p>
<p>『先生，馬上就有空，請坐一坐！』接着學徒送上一杯茶，一支烟，一條熱毛巾。於是你就祇好在那裹坐着像生病人似的等過去，「走」是不好意思的。</p>
<p>有空了，就　補上去，終於也挨到了我。</p>
<p>「先生，我們今朝是頭一天開工，有的人家老闆不肯加工錢，所以還沒有開手哩！」邊說，邊替我解鈕扣，圍白布。</p>
<p>『那末，你們的工錢加多少呢？』我順便問着。</p>
<p>『我們是做「拆賬」的。從前是「三七拆」，現在變做「四六拆」，實在日脚難過呀，先生！』</p>
<p>一套一套做完，已經化去了一個半鐘頭。</p>
<p>「先生，覅客氣！』當我在開那紙頭摺的皮夾的時候，理髮匠在我耳邊咕噥着。</p>
<p>我給他五角錢，他說『先生，今朝要七角。請儂看看個張條子！」他手指着玻璃窗。</p>
<p>「喔，原來他們是這樣加薪水的！』我恍然地暗自忖度着。</p>
<p>到底「長毛」的力量是偉大的——衆人頭上加起來的數字是可驚的！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>剃過頭，媽父叫我去洗澡。『唉，今天的日子眞不好過！』</p>
<p>挾上衣服，又奔向洗澡堂。</p>
<p>進門，是紅的「肉弄堂」，滿房間的汽水，頓時遮住了兩眼前的玻璃。</p>
<p>「沒有空位子，耍末坐一坐！』堂倌冷冰冰的回答，大概不是老主顧吧。</p>
<p>『好吧，今天總得等了！』於是索性躭下去。</p>
<p>好容易輪到了我，洗完澡出來，看見旁邊桌上放着一碟子橄欖（俗稱「元寳」，是取利事的）和一碟子剝好的橘子。我感到高興，這些東西沒有給我，吾則，我的紙皮夾就窘了。</p>
<p>別人付賬有五塊的，我却只有五角大洋，所以茶水，毛巾都不會有我的份兒。</p>
<p>在回家的路上想起理髪匠的說話，『個種日脚勿好過，先生！』</p>
<h3>奮鬬的人生觀（四十）</h3>
<p>因為猶豫失却時機，因為猶豫而養應貽怠，猶豫是失敗的毒素。奮鬥的人，對於最後決定，加以鄭重考慮，免遺後悔則有之，但決不肯且容考慮，且慢決斷，每次的決斷，總不是最後，那末永遠停在考慮的地步。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「別忙，俞先生…你老人家今年大概也不過四十二歲吧？三十一年前你才得十歲模樣，怎麽就會給人家改藝名了？」</p>
<p>這一問倒眞把那位評劇大家問住了，一張烟容滿面的淡黃臉上，不覺很例外的透出了一絲紅意來。</p>
<p>「噢！記錯了！」他勉强想改正過來：「是念一年前，不是三十一年……」</p>
<p>袁紹文忍不住也笑了一笑。不過今兒他是主人，那個西裝少年張天明又是他自己的同學，當然不好意思再讓俞仲遷受窘，便立刻又另外提出了一個談話的題目來。</p>
<p>「天明，你瞧我們三叔現在對待玉琴怎麼樣？</p>
<p>「很不差，」西裝少年把那條緋色的領帶整了一下回答。「似乎不像從前那樣肉麻了！這都是你從旁苦勤的功勞。」</p>
<p>「可是三年前玉振班的學生劉玉華，倒也給了他一個很有力的教訓！」紹文笑着說。</p>
<p>「劉玉華給墳振班開除之後，聽說一直在南邊出台，不知道秋老板那邊可有什麽消息沒有？」俞仲遷也挿嘴進來問。</p>
<p>紹文一面把一疊鈔票掏出來，準備回賬，一面很簡短地答道：</p>
<p>「沒有聽他說起過。」</p>
<p>正在這時候，有一顆光頭打簾于裹探了進來，只一照面，屋子裏的三個人便認識他了。</p>
<p>「榮奎，你可是來催你們老板上館子去嗎？他早就跟袁鎭守使一起走了！」張天明照例總是第一個搶着說話。</p>
<p>榮奎是秋海棠的跟包，此刻倒眞是催戯來的；聽天明遣麼一說，便忙着一說了一聲是，就想旋過身子回去了。（一五）</p>
<h3>虎胆金珠（續）</h3>
<p>— 秀碧</p>
<p>——街頭雜寫之一</p>
<p>於是，在許多人的注目中，他打開了那個包裹，他把那個包裹平放在地上，然後徐徐地打開了。</p>
<p>一粒粒，黑色的，木質的，硬的，像橄欖一樣的東西，便給觀衆們淸楚地看到了。</p>
<p>『這是什麼？』那漢子勁道十足地手指着地上的一包東西，問着觀衆：「橄欖！有許多朋友一定會道樣地回答，難道我們連橄欖都不知道了嗎？哈哈！』</p>
<p>然而，到底是不是橄欖呢？說明又來了。</p>
<p>「哈哈！假使眞的是橄欖，兄弟拿到這兒來，不是發瘋了嗎？諸位不是可以到水菓店去買嗎？吿訴你們，這，不是橄欖，是什麽？」</p>
<p>是什麼呢？又來了：</p>
<p>『說來話長，四年前兄弟到天目山去旅行，遇到了一個老和尙，大家談談經，感情十分接近，因而，老和尙就領我去看一顆樹，一顆生着這許多勞什子的樹。……還有一個環。」</p>
<p>突然從口袋裏摸出了一個木圓環。</p>
<p>「這是木匠做的嗎？那裹會！哼，這木環是天生的，牠就是長在天目山的樹上的啊！環的兩端，便生着那二顆像橄　的勞什子，諸位看啊，環上還有節，若然不相信，說我兄弟「瞎熱昏」，不妨到天目山去問一問老和尙。」</p>
<p>好在天目山遠得很。那漢子眼也不霎一下地繼續喊着：</p>
<p>「這勞什子名叫什麽，叫做「虎膽金珠」，各位只要手握一粒，毒蛇老遠遇見了，便會廻身而去。諸位給蛇咬了的，便祇需把此物在傷處一抹，馬上復原。至於說到價錢，老實說，兄弟目的在濟世，不重錢財，諸位袋裏錢多，慷慨一些，十元八元，多包給你幾粒也行；窮朋友，經濟朋友，沒有錢，那末二毛三毛少包給你幾粒也行……諸位今天遇見我，完全是緣份好！』</p>
<p>週圍的人聽了一大套話，現在終算聽出一個結果來了。有的開始走開，有的摸出了錢來買這「虎膽金珠」。一個女僕模樣的人，給了他二毛錢。</p>
<p>『嫂嫂！你假使袋裏還有錢，不妨多買一些。」</p>
<p>「沒有了，就先包幾隻好了。」</p>
<p>一個黑衣「俠客」給了他一塊錢，他便把鈔票在手中揚了揚，喊着：「位眞是闊氣朋友，一定是發洋財的！』</p>
<p>一個……</p>
<p>一個……</p>
<p>沒有多久，一大包「虎膽金珠」全部買光了，人們也絡續散去，留在行人道上的，就只剩了那一個漢子，一些小孩子，和那條給粉筆畫出來的蛇。</p>
<p>『媽的，曲死！上海人眞是容易騙。』那個漢子把分幣和鈔票細心地包好了放到了口袋裹，也動身走開了，他一路走，一路心裏這樣想着。</p>
<p>「在四海之內，那一項滑頭事業不靠騙，而在上海，那是尤其，那些大老班，闊老爺，俊少年，佾姑娘，那一個不是一天到晚，使着心機，在騙」這一個念頭裏打圈子呢？哈哈！』</p>
<p>這樣地想着，他於是覺得十分地心安意足了，他的走路的姿態也顯得搖搖擺擺，十足快活的樣子。</p>
<p>而在那一塊行人道上，方才是擁擠得很的，現在却只向着那一條粉筆畫的蛇，昂着首，搖着尾，彷彿向過路人打着招呼的樣子。（完）</p>

<h3>談吳天改編的「家」</h3>
<p>— 安陽</p>
<p>吳天改編的「家」可以說是很忠實於巴金的原作，自然許多瑣碎的地方是免去了，這到底是「戲劇的與「小說的」有所差異。</p>
<p>聯繫得緊緊而迂迥地發展，演變，鬥爭中的將崩潰的封建家庭間的糾葛，道意識在吳天是把握得毫無鬆解，因此造成主題易於理解·同時也就是因人物的典型突出有所幫助。因爲通過人物的典型來反映他周圍的生活現象，我們已經易於接受和了解這生活裹包含的觀念了。</p>
<p>劇作是一種藝術的創造，牠不是用公式來機械地說明主題，牠是由於逐漸地摸索到的，牠是經過複雜曲折的路程。這就是改編劇本的技巧問題。在這裹，我們巳發現吳犬是能够從那些瑣碎複雜的沙金中提煉出金子來了。</p>
<p>技巧上最優的地方是把悲劇氣氛造得濃烈萬分，令人透不過氣來。死，固然是悲劇的最高點，然而必須在臨死之前有所糾葛。正如鳴鳳的死，在臨死之前，我們發現她獲得一個救星，使我們心中一鬆，以為可以得救時，她又吿訴給我們：這救星已經太遲了，不中用了，牠仍然是死了。在這緊張的空氣中，表面上似乎為之一鬆，實際已使在緊張的情緒上，反激一下，就有深入人心的最高點。這不過是「家」中一個例子。</p>
<p>在典型人物方面的處理手法是相當高明，在這裏我們看到同情的人物，也看到憎恨的人物，而且我們也看到作者加以深化，擴大，賦予敏銳性與明瞭性，將那些人物的性格眞實而又明確起來了。在這裹，我們找到技巧上是以「對立」來形成牠。吳天不僅是在一個型象的本身來刻意形容，他能巧妙地用相反的形象來與之對照。更可以相同的形象來與之相襯托。光明人物背後也有人，黑暗的人物背後也有人，這悲劇就是這麼地速緊着，迂迴着，鬥爭着。</p>
<p>全劇的發展，從第一幕緩緩地進行，中間是迂迴地向前進行到結束。高潮是適當的，也不會使人感覺是突乎其來，或是平淡無趣。</p>
<p>我祝「家」的演出成功！</p>
<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>伊就縞衣素裳，步出中庭，衆人見如是走來，大呼「柳夫人，尙書所負的債款，請你怎樣了理？」柳如是很溫和地對他們說道。。「尙書所少你們的款項，我都承認。這是尙書所做的事，不關他子女事的。有我在此，祇請你們稍緩些時，我自當負實淸償，你們叉何必這樣叫囂墮突，欺侮孤兒寡婦呢？」衆人一則聽伊說的話，理直氣壯，二則業已允許他們負資歸還，債有主，不落空，兇燄稍戢，都說只要柳夫人能够歸還我們就是了。但是有一半人依然環集門中，不肯離去。其中有一個別號白花蛇何四的，最是憊賴。他糾合的人都隨着他，沒有走。在錢家要酒要肉，坐着吃，吃着要錢。酒食不够時，大家七手八脚的自己到廚下去搬取。喝酒時更是大閙，假裝着醉後發瘋。嗣子沒有法兒對付，依然躱在後面樓上，不敢下樓。柳如是恨恨地說道：「這些人眞是可惡，明欺着尙書死後無人出頭，一味伺隙乘　。如若眞的要錢，也何至於此。嗣子道：「白花蛇何四是此間有名的地痞，以前人家都不理倸他的。自從淸兵南下後，他聯合了一班無賴，首先薙髮，結識幾個旗兵，仗着他們的勢力，在本邑作威作福，欺侮良善，詐取人家的錢財。共勢日盛。儼然厠身於士紳之列。這决索債的事，人家利用了他來威嚇我家，他也想借此淘渾了水來摸魚，所以別人走了，而他尙不肯走，我們怎樣對付他呢？」</p>
<p>（四一）</p>
<p>修養要語（十八）</p>
<p>舟航在大海中，風急浪高，險的確是險的，却未必是惡；不幸被海中的怪物所秉，腥風血雨，相逼而來，惡的確是惡的，却未必是絕，不幸變生肘腋，同舟敵國，那眞是毫無希望了！</p>
<h3>佈景不夠逼真　影城羣趨實地攝製之途　「人慾」已獲圓滿成績</h3>
<p>— 斯華</p>
<p>好萊塢的影片公司大都擁有設備完全的廣大攝影塲，在拍片時無論故事的背景取材於世界各處，結果總是非常圓滿，這自然得力於佈景的精巧，和考據的得當，但雄厚的資本却是一切力量的源泉。</p>
<p>那時，演員白天在攝影塲上工作，扮演阿刺伯的酋長，阿拉斯基的捕獸人，穿紅衣的騎警，西部的流氓或牧童，而晚間仍能回家坐在自已餐桌上晚膳，甜眠在自己的床上。影片公司當局所需要的，一一如願以償，製成逼眞的影片，同時演員們也感覺便利。</p>
<p>時至今日，以上的情形已有相當的變遷，因爲製片成就上的希望增高，攝自佈景的巳嫌其不够逼眞，而羣趨實地拍攝的途徑，演員們被帶往遼遠的地方，他們不再能有往日的享受，而夜宿在帳幕，茅廬，農舍裏。這裏有許多例子：</p>
<p>最近公演過的雷電華公司巨片「人慾」，却爾斯勞頓和卡洛兒朗白，在導演伽遜凱寗率領下，與其他演員不遠千里往北部Napa地方拍攝葡萄園的外景，他們寄宿在農舍，受過不少苦楚。「人慾」劇情是在該地葡萄園裏所發生的人生與愛情的交織，雖然加利福尼省南部也有葡萄園，但這並不是劇情中所需要的Napa的葡萄園呀！</p>
<p>米高梅巨片North　west　Passage是在西部伊達荷省山鄉攝製的，因爲那裹滿山披着綠林，有奔騰的河流，有無底的沼澤，——十足表現騎士羅吉士時代的聖勞倫斯河區域的風貌，雖然這個時代已因文明的進展而成爲往事。斯本塞屈賽在拍本片時和他的夥伴們如同軍隊在野外霧營一般</p>
<p>琴述勞吉斯和佐麥克利爲了拍攝Prlmrose　Path曾往蒙脫萊海濱。現在派拉蒙公司又預備到東部茀爾琴尼亞省去攝製以「茀爾琴尼亞」爲名的影片，正如哥倫比亞公司往阿利松那州攝製以「阿利松那」爲名的影片一般。同時西部影片的新星丁霍爾脫將連演二片，而以西部烏台省的鄉野爲背景去實地拍攝。</p>
<p>好萊塢以前在當地拍攝以佈景作背景的出品，雖亦有不少巨片，但並不滿足，而趨耗資更多的實地攝製之途，完全爲了更求背景的眞實性，這種爲藝術——也可說是爲生意眼的偉大犧牲是値得稱道的。</p>

<h3>施博德設攝影室</h3>
<p>攝影家施博德敎授，是不久以前被併於德國的奧國人。對於攝影術，有甚高的造詣。歐洲藝術界，提起施氏，莫不備致推崇。過去的俄皇尼古拉，奧皇的瑟夫，及英皇愛德華七世，皆會特請施氏為之攝影。其作會先後陳列於巴黎及倫敦國際展覽會，已獲輿論界一致好評。所作「膠炭像」，可以强調被攝者的特點，使之神采飛動，而且經久不變。此外天然色彩攝影，油渲術，均爲施氏專長。施氏來滬年餘，現設攝影室於江西路二六七號，愛好留影者，幸勿失之交臂。</p>

<h3>The Resolution of the New Fourth Army Incident Should Be Extremely Cautious - The Ta Kung Pao's Stance</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao's editorial today, titled "On the New Fourth Army Incident," in addition to criticizing the army for disrupting the front line and attacking friendly forces, stated that the central government has been extremely lenient and tolerant. The feeling of our people is that after the Xi'an Incident, the Communist army was reorganized into the National Army, and the supreme command authority was established, which marked the completion of national unification. This unified structure was achieved after more than 20 years of civil war, with the shedding of countless blood and countless sacrifices. If there had been no such unified structure, we would not have been qualified to launch this war of national self-defense. The national command authority, which was obtained with such difficulty, must be resolutely upheld by all the people. The nation, which has already been unified, must not be allowed to be divided by all the people. However, from a political point of view, the New Fourth Army incident, this part of the army, although the original quality of this part of the army is slightly different, and only joined the National Army's combat sequence after the outbreak of the war of resistance, it is hoped that the General Staff Department will handle it carefully. Apart from rectifying military discipline, emotions should not be mixed in. We earnestly hope that Ye Ting himself can be granted leniency, and we earnestly hope that the central government will handle this issue with caution, so as not to cause any unnecessary complications and spread.

<h3>Zhou Zhongyue Reports on the Administration of Yunnan Province, Progress Made in Various Facilities, Morale of the Yunnan Army Extremely High</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Minister of the Interior Zhou Zhongyue recently returned to Chongqing after visiting disaster victims in Yunnan. On the morning of the 20th, he attended the Central Memorial Week and reported on the military and political facilities in Yunnan Province. Zhou first said that since Japan and France established an agreement, Japanese aircraft have raided Yunnan more frequently than before. The disaster victims have been relieved by the local government's allocation of funds and are deeply grateful. Next, he described military equipment, saying that the Japanese actions in Vietnam have not relaxed their ambition to invade China. The border defense of Yunnan Province is very important, and it has been completed in accordance with the central government's plan. The morale is extremely high. The military service facilities, which are closely related to military affairs, are also being actively promoted. He then described the political progress, divided into five items: civil administration, finance, economy, construction, and education. (1) In terms of civil administration, the implementation of the new county system began last year, abolishing the district system and expanding the township system. It was largely completed by the end of last year. There has been considerable success in accumulating grain and strictly prohibiting opium. (2) In terms of finance, the national and local revenue and expenditure have been divided, and a business tax has been implemented to supplement the lack of government expenses. The land has been cleared and production has been increased, and the acreage has almost doubled. New regulations have been formulated, land taxes have been collected, and surcharges have been canceled and graded taxes have been collected. As for local finance, in order to establish the foundation of county local finance, all county land taxes will be allocated to local administrative and business expenses, and all miscellaneous taxes will be canceled to reduce the burden on the people. The public treasury law is implemented, and county finances are gradually on track. In addition to providing various expenses, production businesses can also be organized within their capabilities. (3) In terms of economy, the province has set up many factories. The Fudian Bank has extended loans to farmers amounting to more than 20 million. There are also more than 20 other large investments in agriculture, industry, and mining. The stabilization of prices has shown considerable effect. (4) In terms of construction, a highway plan has been formulated, dividing the province's highways into three types: provincial highways, county highways, and village highways, with the main purpose of rushing to repair provincial highways and selecting county highways for repair. It has now been opened to traffic, with a route length of more than 3,000 kilometers, and another 3,000 kilometers are being planned to be rushed to repair. As for production matters, the development of water conservancy, the improvement of rice, wheat, tea, mulberry, cotton, and other plants have all been carried out separately and have been quite successful. (5) In terms of education, in order to adapt to wartime needs and to promote and improve the national education plan, it is required to be completed within a time limit. Wartime mass education has run 1,720 classes, accommodating more than 80,000 illiterate adults, and improving teachers' treatment. The expenses for enriching educational equipment and building libraries have reached 3 million yuan. There are also preferential measures for the education of chieftains. Zhou said at the end that, after nearly four years of war, the Japanese are deeply mired and unable to end it, and they often spread rumors. However, the military and civilians of Yunnan Province have an extraordinary determination to fight. After the war, Chairman Long swore to contribute all the manpower and material resources of the province to the country. In recent years, the training of troops and the purchase of guns have all been sent to the front. This is a fact that everyone has seen. Recently, a strict defense has been deployed on the Yunnan-Vietnam border, waiting for the opportunity to attack the Japanese. At this time, our country has a supreme commander who knows people and is good at assigning them, and military officers who are loyal to the country. No matter how the Japanese spread rumors, they can never destroy this kind of spiritual unity. Our country will surely be able to win the war. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Evolution of American Policy</h3>
<p>Future generations who study world history will certainly pay the most attention to the actions of the United States in this chapter on today. It is the current world center of gravity, and its recent actions and expressions are the factors that determine the current world development.</p>
<p>The basic policy of the United States has not changed, but the focus of its policy is moving forward. In other words, the previous focus was on "maintaining the dignity of treaties," and the current focus is on "firmly supporting freedom and democracy." There was a setback between these two: that is, in 1931, when Japan invaded and occupied the three northeastern provinces, British Foreign Secretary Simon refused to cooperate in sanctioning Japan. After that, through the highest point of the Munich Conference, until the outbreak of the European War, isolationists took advantage of the international counter-current and emphasized the protection of the Western Hemisphere, and did not intervene in any disputes in Europe. Even the extreme claim was to withdraw from the Far East at the same time and abandon the Philippine Islands. The slogan covering up this setback sang loudly: "Keep the United States from getting involved in the whirlpool of war!" And the psychology that formed this setback was, on the one hand, an extreme distrust of Britain's determination. On the other hand, it was a fundamental suspicion of the Soviet Union's intentions. This psychology was revealed at its peak when the European War broke out in 1939. The momentum of the isolationist faction at that time almost overwhelmed everything: people like Colonel Lindbergh, who openly spoke for Germany and Italy, actually touched the hearts of many people. The collapse of France also happened to coincide with the meeting. However, when President Roosevelt replied to French Prime Minister Reynaud's final appeal at that time, in addition to allowing his best efforts to support him, he had to solemnly declare: "Limited to not joining the war." It can be seen how painstaking Roosevelt was at that time!</p>
<p>However, after this setback, the United States finally moved forward bravely and brought out the brilliance of its basic policy. Originally, the United States based its international policy on the "Monroe Doctrine" of 1823; that is, the so-called "From now on, the Americas will no longer be the object of European colonization," prohibiting European powers from interfering in or intervening in the affairs of the Americas. From a certain angle, this should be regarded as a negative aspect, and should not be regarded as the whole picture of the United States' international policy. Because the Americas can never be isolated from the world. Its participation in the First World War was indeed for the United States and for the Americas. This is a clear and obvious truth. Therefore, the United States applied its policy to two treaties in the post-war international situation: one was the "Treaty of Versailles" in 1919, and the other was the "Kellogg-Briand Pact" in 1928. According to the treaty, it opposed the unilateral destruction of the status quo in violation of the treaty. According to the treaty, it also initiated various conferences to reduce armaments and peacefully resolve international disputes. Especially for Asia, it also initiated the "Nine-Power Treaty" in Washington in 1922. According to this treaty, it made every effort to uphold the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, adhered to the "Open Door Policy," and did not recognize territorial changes through violent aggression, which is the deduction of the Nine-Power Treaty. These three treaties are the active aspects of the United States' international policy; that is, the basic tone of "maintaining the dignity of treaties," on which the focus of the United States' national policy rests.</p>
<p>The United States' focus on "maintaining the dignity of treaties" as its policy will never change, but after the collapse of France, the American people, stimulated and taught by it, and threatened and endangered by it, were suddenly aware that it was not enough to merely maintain this focus, so they moved forward. The first step was to transport a large number of military equipment and weapons to Britain, and at the same time, it began to build up its own arms. The political form of this was that the isolationist faction naturally gradually declined, while hardliners Stimson and Knox and others joined forces to take up important positions. The US-Canada joint defense and the leasing of British bases also automatically assumed a part of the British Empire's defense. In fact, the object of this second step can be said to be entirely to do its best to assist Britain. By the time Germany, Italy, and Japan formally announced their alliance, it was proven that it was not enough for the United States to merely assist Britain alone. It was clear that the current problem for the United States was not to assist others; its inevitable reasoning and inevitable trend were as stated by former US Ambassador to France Bullitt in his speech on the relocation of the Tripartite Pact: "We can only have sufficient time to strengthen our national defense, and most of it depends on Britain resisting the Nazis in Europe. China resists Japan in Asia, and whether China and Britain can resist to the end depends on the degree and speed of our assistance." Under this understanding, there is its third step; that is, to carry out its planned large-scale assistance to both China and Britain at the same time. The opening of the Burma Road and the Anglo-American lending of large sums to China have appeared one after another. Step-by-step progress has its consistent significance; and the outline of its current stage is as clearly stated in Roosevelt's fireside chat at the end of the year: (1) Oppose the "new order" (2) Assist China and Britain, defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan, in order to avoid the scourge of war for the United States. (3) If necessary, the United States has the determination to fight. To sum up the outline and seek its focus, it lies in "firmly upholding freedom and democracy."</p>
<p>The activeness of American policy has now fully matured. It stands opposite the Tripartite Alliance in the majestic posture of a fully armed giant. Determined to crush Germany, Italy, and Japan's dream of dividing and controlling the world!</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Third Inauguration: Washington Celebrates with Enthusiasm; Tens of Thousands Gather to Hear the President's Speech; Americans Devote Themselves to the Nation in the Face of Crisis</h3>
<p>Washington—As Roosevelt donned the presidential robes for the third time, he delivered a speech stating that Americans are moving forward bravely and dedicating themselves to the nation in order to confront an unprecedented crisis. Roosevelt took the oath of office at 12:10 PM yesterday (1:10 AM this morning, Shanghai time) before Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court. Prior to the oath, he silently prayed at the historic St. John's Church at 10:40 AM, seeking divine guidance and praying for an early realization of peace. It is said that the seat where the President knelt was the same place where President Madison prayed in 1816. At the same time, no fewer than tens of thousands of people attended to hear the President's speech, and the streets were filled with enthusiastic onlookers. One million people reportedly participated in some part of the ceremony. As Roosevelt and his entourage entered the church, the crowd outside applauded and cheered. The President's car, protected by 50 motorcycles, entered the church after a small path was specially cleared to accommodate them. President Roosevelt left the White House at 11:30 AM, taking a route to the location where the ceremony was held. Meanwhile, foreign envoys also gathered there, adorned with gold and silver ornaments, and stepped onto the altar. German Consul Thomson, wearing a morning suit, arrived first with his wife. By noon, 100,000 spectators had gathered and cheered for the President's car. The naval band played "Hail to the Chief." Four army patrol cars, carrying machine guns, closely guarded the President's car. The President decided to make this inauguration ceremony simpler than previous ones because he insisted it must be so. The President also reviewed new mechanized and military equipment on the White House grandstand, with foreign representatives in attendance. A new feature of this decision was the aerial performance by the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps pilots. Students from West Point and Annapolis also participated in the regular military drills and parades, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery, all carrying the latest American mechanical equipment. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Before the Oath: Praying for Peace</p>
<p>Washington—Before heading to the Capitol for the inauguration oath ceremony, President Roosevelt led his family into church to pray for world peace and American freedom. After the prayer, he returned to the White House in an open car, and soon after drove from the White House to the Capitol. He traveled along Pennsylvania Avenue, where flags were waving and the streets were lined with spectators. The 75,000 spectators lining the streets cheered like thunder. The President frequently waved his hat to the crowd. Those accompanying him included House Speaker Rayburn and Senate Republican Leader Barkley. The President's car was in the first position, followed by the First Lady's car, and then the car of former Vice President Garner and current Vice President Wallace and their wives. Police and secret detectives provided close protection along the way. Many people from all over the United States and Canada came to the American capital to witness the grand ceremony, numbering in the tens of thousands, so all the hotels were fully booked yesterday. Although the sun was shining brightly on this day, the cold wind was sharp, so most of the spectators wore heavy fur coats. A special grandstand was built in front of the Capitol, supported by white giant pillars. The President's mother and family were seated here to watch the ceremony. Preceding the President's car were a large number of policemen on motorized bicycles, and flanking the President's car were four military vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. The President and Vice President got out of the car, entered the hall, and stood bareheaded. Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court administered the oath. A few minutes after Wallace took the oath, Roosevelt took the oath of office amid cheers, and assumed the third term of the presidency. The time was 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>President's Speech: Broadcast Everywhere</p>
<p>The car rotated to address the crowd. Whenever the siren sounded, the crowd responded with applause. His speech was broadcast around the world via radio. After the speech, the national anthem was played, and the President and the crowd stood up. The oath ceremony was the same as previous inaugurations, but it had new significance due to the international situation. The most insightful words in the President's speech were: "The current danger is unprecedented. Our firm interest at this moment is to maintain the integrity of democracy and preserve it forever. To achieve this goal, we must unite the spirit and faith of the Americas to achieve it. We do not retreat, nor do we stand still. As Americans, we should follow the will of Heaven and move forward in the service of the nation to achieve success." The entire audience applauded unanimously upon hearing this. Observers said that the President's demeanor was more solemn than usual before taking the oath, and his tone was more impassioned when speaking, also different from the past. However, he was in high spirits when entertaining guests after the ceremony. The President said that maintaining the American spirit and faith is the highest reason why we are willing to make all kinds of sacrifices in national defense. If this spirit is lost, then even if the shell remains, America will have already perished. This kind of spirit, this kind of faith, speaks to us in our daily lives in a way that is not always noticed, and also speaks to us from other countries in the Western Hemisphere and from overseas countries that have been reduced to slavery and are still free. Sometimes we do not hear it, or we hear it but ignore it, because the privilege of our freedom has become commonplace to us, and we are unaware of it.</p>
<p>The Dignified Flame Must Be Maintained</p>
<p>When President Washington first took office in 1789, he spoke of maintaining the dignified flame of liberty and the republican system. If we lose this dignified flame now, or allow this flame to be extinguished by doubt, then wouldn't we be abandoning the future that President Washington painstakingly established? The American people renew their intention to dedicate themselves to America every time a President is inaugurated. Today, the national responsibility is to protect the country and its system from external disturbances. We must sometimes hesitate, reflect, and recall what our position is in history and consider what position we can have today and in the future in the face of rapidly changing times. If we do not, then we are committing the real danger of having no motivation to rise up. The life of a country is not determined by the calculation of years, but by the survival of the human spirit. The life of a person is seventy years, or more or less than that, but the life of a country is the fulfillment of its will to exist. Some people may doubt this, and some people may believe that a democratic system and way of life are limited by a mysterious fate, and that for incomprehensible reasons, autocracy and slavery will become the rising tide of the future, and freedom will become the receding tide. Know that we Americans all believe otherwise.</p>
<p>Democracy is Flourishing</p>
<p>Democracy has not diminished today, this is what we know, because we clearly see that democracy still exists and is flourishing. We know that it can never be destroyed, because democracy is created by the driving force of individual men and women united in a common cause, and this common cause is expressed by a free majority of the people. Democracy, alone among various political systems, can absorb the entire power of free will. Democracy has created an unlimited civilization that can continuously improve and advance human life. If we look beneath the surface, we will see that democracy is still prevalent on all continents, as it is the most humane, the most progressive, and the most unconquerable of all political systems in human society. Because of all this, we know that democracy will never perish. A country is like a person, with its own heart. This heart must know something and always be vigilant, and it must also understand the hopes and needs of its neighbors, because other countries must live together in this small world. A country, like a person, has something that is more profound, more eternal, and more magnificent than anything else. We now have something that is of the utmost importance to our future and that requires us to provide the most solemn protection to the current situation. It is difficult to include this thing in a simple term, and almost impossible, but none of us do not know what this thing is. This is the product of hundreds of years. The desire for democracy is not a recent development in human history, it is human history itself. It originated in the lives of ancient people, flourished in the Middle Ages, was recorded in the Magna Carta, continued to move forward without ever stopping, and is a constantly updated doctrine.

<p>People Across America Praise the President</p>
<p>Washington—Yesterday, President Roosevelt stated in his inaugural address that he would dedicate his third term to defending democracy. Montana Democratic Senator Wheeler, a well-known advocate of non-interventionism, said, "I completely agree with everything the President said in his speech today. I will do my best to help him defend the democratic system and free institutions." New York Republican Fish said forcefully, "The President is working hard to maintain our current system against those who seek to destroy our system. I will support him with all my strength." Another advocate of non-interventionism, Kansas Republican Senator Kebert, said, "President Roosevelt is a great fighter for democracy, and he has proven it again today. People are generally uneasy about his joining the war, but I fully support his determination to maintain the democratic system." The President accepted his third term with his usual fortitude and cheerfulness. After attending a reception for governors and senior officials, the President gathered his family and friends at the White House to spend his evening. (International News Service, 21st)</p>
<h3>Man with Gun Arrested in White House Square</h3>
<p>Washington—Yesterday, as President Roosevelt was returning to the White House after being sworn in at the Capitol, secret detectives arrested a man with a loaded pistol hidden on his person in the square in front of the White House. His name is unknown, and he has been taken to the hospital for investigation. Later, he told the police that he was responsible for protecting the President. Another person was arrested for waving a sharp knife in the crowd of onlookers, also using protecting the President as an excuse. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Air Defense Drills Held in Eastern US States; Four-Day Period, Confidential Situation</h3>
<p>New York—The US Army and Air Defense Command held air raid and air defense drills at dawn today. The security was very tight, and even carefully selected journalists were unable to find out the details due to complete military inspections. The drills are scheduled for four days. The exercise is a hypothetical enemy air raid on the industrial center of the Northeast coast, while the defending forces provide protection. There are 10,000 civilian watchmen in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the part of New York State east of the Hudson River, forming a watch team. If they spot enemy aircraft in the sky, they will immediately report to the central military departments in Boston and New York. Based on these reports, fighter planes will take off to intercept the enemy aircraft. Army officials hope to see the shortcomings of the current air defense plan from this exercise.

<h3>Military Commission Sends Personnel to Handle Inspection Matters</h3>
<p>Chongqing—Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to unifying the national inspection work. In December of the 29th year [1940], he issued a hand order to the Supervision Office of the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Commission, strictly limiting all provinces and regions to unify the national inspection work by the Supervision Office before February 1 of this year, in order to facilitate transportation and eliminate the evils of smuggling. After receiving the order, the Military Commission, in addition to announcing in major newspapers, specially appointed commissioners Chen Shijing and Liu Yan to lead soldiers and take several special cars to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Yunnan, and other provinces to conduct on-site inspections and urge the handling of unified inspection matters. If there are any more violations of orders, or those who obey in appearance but disobey in reality, they will be immediately arrested and severely punished to rectify the inspection administration. It is reported that the two commissioners Chen and Liu are preparing to depart after receiving the order. (Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>In the 76th Session of the Japanese Diet, Matsuoka Delivers a Diplomatic Speech; Seeks to Break the Deadlock Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Sharply Criticizes the United States' Far East Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo—At the opening of the 76th session of the Japanese Diet this morning, Foreign Minister Matsuoka gave a speech reviewing Japan's foreign policy in a comprehensive manner. He stated that Japan wanted to dispel misunderstandings with the Soviet Union, and "if possible," planned to make a fundamental adjustment to Japanese-Soviet relations with far-reaching impact. Matsuoka opposed the United States' policy in East Asia and expressed Japan's determination to stabilize the Far East. Matsuoka mentioned the Dutch East Indies, saying that the situation hindering the development of Japan's natural relations with the Dutch East Indies must be thoroughly remedied and good-neighborly relations obtained to promote mutual prosperity. Negotiations between Japan and Vietnam are proceeding in a friendly atmosphere. Regarding the dispute between Vietnam and Thailand, Matsuoka said that a movement has now been aroused among the Thai people to recover their former territories annexed by Vietnam. Matsuoka went on to mention Japan's renewed harmony with the Near East and South American countries, and reiterated that the Tripartite Pact was not intended to target any country, saying that the alliance aims at strong peaceful cooperation to establish a new world order. On this point, Matsuoka specifically stated that the pact was not directed against the Soviet Union, saying that in establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and ensuring peace in the East, it was inappropriate to let the current diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union take their own course. Therefore, we are making the greatest efforts to dispel mutual misunderstandings, and, if possible, to make a fundamental adjustment to diplomatic relations with far-reaching impact. At this time, Japan is negotiating with the Soviet Union on the delimitation of the border between Manchuria and Outer Mongolia, fishing, and Japan's concession rights in northern Sakhalin. Several of these outstanding issues are now on the way to being resolved. On this point, Germany and Italy are willing to agree with Japan, and Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact is also clarified to be in line with Japan's above-mentioned intentions. This pact is not directed against the Soviet Union. We sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will understand Japan's true intentions, and hope that the two countries will be moved by the spirit of mutual concession and goodwill, and complete the re-adjustment of the relations between the two countries." Matsuoka went on to mention the US policy, saying, "The United States has made it clear that it does not fully understand the proposal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is related to Japan's survival. The United States clearly holds the view that its own first line of defense extends eastward from the mid-Atlantic, but westward not only to the eastern Pacific, but also as far as China and the South Seas. If the United States can hold this attitude, then accusing Japan's hegemony in the western Pacific as a sign of Japan's ambition is at least a one-sided statement from the US side. I believe that the United States' taking this position cannot contribute to the promotion of world peace. Frankly speaking, for the sake of US-Japan friendship, for the sake of peace in the Pacific, and for the sake of general peace, I am very sorry for this attitude of the United States. I sincerely hope that a great power like the United States, which rationally uses its power, will understand its responsibility for maintaining peace, reflect deeply on its attitude with the true spirit of fearing God, and bravely liquidate the past situation, and make its greatest efforts to alleviate the crisis that civilization is about to encounter. The chaos in the current international situation has not diminished, but has intensified. If the United States is unfortunately dragged into the European war, and Japan is also forced to participate in the war, then another world war, in name and in fact, will break out and become a situation that all attempts cannot save. As the war intensifies and terrifying new weapons that have not been used before are used, no one can guarantee that it will not lead to a war that overturns modern civilization. The purpose of the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact is not only to strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but also to prevent the continued expansion of the current disputes during construction. We must strive to end the current war as soon as possible, and resolve the world's chaotic situation. At the same time, we must study and formulate precedents to prevent such disturbances from recurring in the future. The goal of the Tripartite Pact is to build a new world order. Given time, this goal will surely be achieved. There is no doubt that it will be a laborious and exhausting task. If the Japanese people are fully and firmly prepared for this task, then the Japanese Empire has a great and glorious future." (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo—Prime Minister Konoe, in addressing the House of Peers, reiterated the seriousness of Japan's current domestic and foreign situation and called on the entire country to unite at this moment. After the Prime Minister finished his speech, Foreign Minister Matsuoka presented his foreign policy, followed by reports from the Army and Navy Ministers on the war situation in China. Then, a closed-door meeting was held, in which the ministers explained in detail the various difficulties facing the country. These remarks were again presented to the House of Representatives this afternoon, followed by a report from the Minister of Finance on the nation's finances. Then, the House also held a closed-door meeting. In his speech, the Prime Minister briefly outlined the government's domestic and foreign policies, and then seriously warned the two Houses that the Empire was encountering unprecedented difficulties in its history. He said, "We must develop the nation's strength to the highest degree internally in order to complete the national structure that emphasizes national defense, so that we can obtain sufficient military preparations to implement national policy. Externally, we must present a plan commensurate with the international development rights to announce the great development of our country's future." (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo—Today's editorial in the Kokumin Shimbun stated that the most urgent task for the Diet to handle now is to deal with the American problem. It is now appropriate to postpone the discussion of domestic issues in order to solve the greater problem. The article mentioned the recent declaration of the United States, saying that we are now being insulted, threatened, vilified, and boldly challenged every day. It also recalled the hope to understand Japan in fifty years, saying that the United States now anticipates a crisis to occur within a few months. We cannot wait another fifty years.

<h3>End of the German-Italian Summit: Spring Offensive Imminent; Mussolini Returns to Rome Yesterday Morning; British Increasingly Believe Germany Will Invade Southern Ireland</h3>
<p>Berlin: Official sources refuse to release any information regarding the content of the talks between Hitler and Mussolini, only stating that the official communiqué has already outlined the topics discussed, which were limited to the current international situation. The location and timing of the meeting remain unknown. Authoritative sources refused to confirm the meeting before the official announcement, telling foreign reporters that, for military reasons, any news about the movements and meetings of important figures must be kept strictly confidential until the communiqué is released. Political observers here have not yet commented on the meeting between the two leaders. They only point out that previous meetings between the German and Italian leaders have often had far-reaching effects on the world situation. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government announced the news of the meeting between Mussolini and Hitler at 7:15 last night, stating, "Premier Mussolini of Italy and Leader Hitler of Germany exchanged comprehensive views on the current world situation. The Foreign Ministers of Germany and Italy were also present. The talks proceeded in a spirit of friendship between the two leaders and the solidarity of the armed comrades of the German and Italian people. A complete consensus has been reached on various issues." This news will not be published in the Italian press until Thursday morning. The meeting was not entirely unexpected, as well-informed diplomatic and journalistic circles had earlier received news of Mussolini's departure. Three foreign journalists, including two Americans, had their telephone lines cut off by official order for releasing this information, as Italian practice dictates that important events are only announced after they have taken place. This meeting is of great significance for the future military actions of the Axis powers. The location of the meeting was not announced. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Premier Mussolini, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ciano and German Ambassador Mackensen, returned here at 10 o'clock this morning. The Italian Premier is returning to the capital after his meeting with Hitler. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>German-Italian Leaders' Secret Meeting: Discussing Control of the Mediterranean</p>
<p>London: Sources here now believe that the secret meeting between Hitler and Mussolini must have been to discuss the completion of the plan to drive Britain out of the Mediterranean or to assist Italy. Regarding German aid to Italy, such as the establishment of a large German air force base in Sicily and the arrival of countless German technicians in key Italian areas, these are all obvious. Well-informed sources here expect that these activities may continue to expand, and Hitler may concentrate a sufficient number of low-altitude bombers on Italian territory to carry out his even more ambitious task of preventing British fleets from sailing in the Mediterranean. Accompanying this German action will inevitably be greater activity by Italian submarines to attack British naval vessels and merchant ships. Parliamentarians close to the government say that the two dictators must also have discussed their hoped-for successful spring offensive plan. It is widely believed that Hitler will try to make Britain believe that he can launch an offensive on a vast and crucial front, starting from the Balkans, through the Mediterranean, and Spain, all the way to Ireland and the British Isles. He hopes that this extensive front-line attack will intimidate Britain into disbanding its army. They also say that reports of German plans to attack Ireland in the spring are now gaining credibility, and that the initial invasion may involve the landing of thousands of paratroopers far from the coast. They also believe that Hitler's main plan may be to establish a strong military presence in Ireland, to completely or partially disrupt British communications with the Americas, and to use Ireland as a base necessary for the final conquest of the British mainland. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin: High-ranking sources here predicted yesterday that an unprecedented multi-pronged offensive would follow closely on the heels of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting. This offensive aims to defeat Britain before the United States expands its aid to Britain. At the same time, knowledgeable sources made an important prediction that Britain will soon occupy Southern Ireland. The Urim Report, the capital city of Yugoslavia, acknowledges, "The Hitler-Mussolini meeting was the last meeting before the attack on Britain," and believes that French military representatives also attended the meeting. The German claim that Britain intends to occupy Southern Ireland is reminiscent of the same rhetoric used by Germany before Norway was occupied by Germany. Observers here believe that the German press reports that Britain is currently preparing to occupy Southern Ireland are a prelude to Germany's attack on the Free State of Ireland. (International News Service dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Discusses the Situation in Southeastern Europe: Germany Can Invade the Balkans at Any Time</p>
<p>London: The Times commented on the German-Italian summit, saying that it seems obvious that the Axis powers are now focusing their attention on Southeastern Europe. The offensive against Greece has demonstrated the unreliability of Mussolini's war machine. Hitler cannot risk launching an offensive in the Balkans without first consolidating his flanks. Now Hitler has seized key positions in Sicily and the Adriatic Sea, and can consolidate his flanks. Hitler now seems determined to wage war on two fronts simultaneously. The German General Staff has long considered fighting on two fronts to be inadvisable. However, Germany has now strengthened its military position and can advance into the Balkans when it decides to invade the Balkans. All sectors of Turkey are maintaining a silent trust and do not lightly believe in rumors of war breaking out soon. However, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia will bear the brunt of the Axis powers' threat. Bulgaria's steadfastness and friendship are currently beneficial to Yugoslavia, and the Greek resistance victory is also enough to sway hearts and minds, far from what the Romanian incident can compare. If the Axis powers truly intend to add troops to Yugoslavia, believing that they can drive straight in, then rashness would be extreme. The increase in the country's resources and the enhanced scope and efficiency of British military power are all essential factors in determining victory or defeat. These factors have now had a powerful impact on the balance of power in the Balkans. The United States' attention to the Balkans is also obvious. At this time, Colonel Donovan's visit can be seen as having special significance. The determination of Britain and the United States to defeat the Axis powers is an essential element in any assessment of the future of the Balkans, and a necessary condition for the future freedom of the Balkans.

<h3>British Troops Deep into Eritrea, Advancing Towards the Red Sea; Simultaneously Advancing on Tobruk; Italian Troops Continue to Retreat in Gazala</h3>
<p>Cairo: According to a dispatch from Sudan late yesterday, British troops have entered Italian Eritrea and are making satisfactory progress. It is estimated that the Italian troops retreating from Gazala number between 5,000 and 8,000, mostly indigenous troops commanded by Italian officers. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Cairo: Battle reports state that two British columns, covered by the British Air Force, advanced deep into Eritrea yesterday, pushing towards the Red Sea and pursuing the fleeing Italian troops. The new British offensive has made progress due to the British occupation of Gazala and the capture of the fortresses of Saboterete and Taiseni. This offensive has threatened the northeastern corner and coastline of the Italian African Empire, causing a rupture in the Italian line. Large numbers of British troops immediately seized the opportunity to enter, "intending to make contact with the retreating enemy." The British Air Force also heavily bombed Italian bases and Italian mechanized units in Eritrea. (International News Service dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Cairo: Headquarters intelligence states that the retreat of Italian troops from Gazala, an important stronghold on the eastern front of British Egypt Sudan, continued yesterday. The intelligence stated that British troops continue to advance successfully on several fronts. The Royal Air Force on Sunday attacked the Italian strongholds of Biretro in central Algeria and Catania, an important seaport in Sicily, dropping high-explosive incendiary bombs on military concentration points and equipment transport ships. News from London states that military leaders estimate that Italian casualties in the Gazala area in the past six months were 2,000, while British losses were less than one-tenth. London believes that the recapture of Gazala is "a major defeat for Italy." (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>US to Postpone Implementation of Freezing Deposits</h3>
<p>New York: According to reliable sources on Wall Street, the US government does not intend to freeze foreign deposits in the US in the near future. This matter will depend on the future of the world situation. The Commercial Daily News stated that since Germany and the Soviet Union occupied several European countries last summer, the deposits of those countries in the United States have been frozen. Since then, there have been repeated informal discussions on the general issue of freezing, but they have all been opposed by the State Department. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Laval Revolves from Germany; Set to Make a Comeback; Germany Hints He Must Be Given the Position of Foreign Minister; Rumor Has It That Hitler Carried a Letter to Pétain</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the reconciliation between French Head of State General Pétain and former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, as claimed in the Vichy communiqué, seems to be the result of constant pressure from Germany, and may indicate a break in the "Pétain front." If Laval can clarify the "misunderstanding" that led to his sudden dismissal and imprisonment five weeks ago, then Germany will likely continue to pressure Laval to return to the cabinet. The Vichy government has not announced Laval's new position, but Berlin has hinted that Laval is the "Foreign Minister of the Florentin Cabinet." This likely means that Germany wants Laval to continue serving as Foreign Minister. Hitler waited for Pétain and Laval to have this "reconciliation" before meeting with Mussolini, because the task he plans to assign to France will have a major impact on the Axis powers' future plans in the Mediterranean.

<p>Painful History of the European War (8)</p>
<h3>Memories of Disorganized British and French Lines</h3>
<p>He stood in front of the desk, head held high, hands in his pockets. After this farewell, I never met him again.</p>
<p>The next day, I was received by the military officers and found them more optimistic. They praised the morale of the French troops making deep deployments along the Somme and Aisne Rivers defense lines. They told me that General Weygand had decided not to construct a continuous defense line. If necessary, he would allow enemy tanks to break through the defense lines, but would firmly hold the strongholds on both sides to ensure that the enemy infantry and artillery could not follow the tanks. Unfortunately, our most elite divisions had been sacrificed in the battle in the north. Therefore, the strength of the new defense line was weaker than on May 10.</p>
<p>On June 2, 240 German aircraft bombed Paris. British Minister of Information Duff Cooper flew to Paris that day. The French Minister of Information, Frossard, had lunch with him, and I was also invited to accompany them. The location was the Ritz Hotel. Just as we were seated, the air raid siren suddenly sounded. The waiters恪守防空規則, and in an instant, they all hid in the cellar. At that time, the minister and his entourage were truly in a dilemma. It would be unheroic to hide, but it seemed undignified to do it themselves. They had no choice but to sit still, staring at the empty plates and listening to the incessant roar of artillery fire. The hateful German aircraft deliberately made things difficult, and the alarm was not lifted for a long time. They were hungry and their conversation became dull. A secretary called the police station to inquire and received a report that "the situation is very serious. The arsenal has been hit by bombs, the aviation department is on fire, and hundreds of people have been killed or injured."</p>
<p>When I returned home, the children were all vying to tell me that they had seen German aircraft flying high in the sky, like a swarm of bees, appearing and disappearing in the sunlight. Paris did not seem panicked by this bombing. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that the threat of German aircraft was not as terrible as the rumors suggested. The next day, news came that the German army had launched a new offensive along the Somme and Aisne Rivers front lines. British General Commander Gort and his subordinates had all withdrawn from France. At this time, I was reassigned to the British Air Force.</p>
<p>At this time, the British Air Force Command was located in the Wan Luoai area. I was received by Air Force Deputy Commander General Playfair. If you have seen more British Air Force officers, you will be surprised by how similar they look. They have handsome faces, blue eyes, and although their hair is graying, they still exude vigor. Their attitudes are gentle, their temperaments are resolute and decisive, their actions are courteous, and they strictly abide by discipline. These are all characteristics of the British Air Force.</p>
<p>General Playfair said to me, "Although the German Air Force outnumbers us, it is clearly inferior to us in terms of quality. Their losses are three to four times higher than ours, so the current situation is much better than at the beginning of the war."</p>
<p>Near Troyes, I saw two squadrons of British elite Hurricane aircraft and several young team members around 19 years old. They had brown hair, blue eyes, and each had a victory record of shooting down enemy aircraft more than ten times. Although the people and machines were excellent, I was still astonished by the small number of aircraft. Britain only had a few squadrons of aircraft in France, at least in the area I inspected. When I returned to Paris, the bad news that enemy mechanized troops had reached the outskirts of Rouen prompted me to express my feelings to my superior, Colonel Shiver, saying, "I think your country must still have a lot of fighters at home. We must send them to France. What will be decided at this moment is not only the fate of France, but also the fate of Britain!"</p>
<p>He replied, "You must go to England and call on the British people over the radio."</p>
<p>British public opinion is not yet fully aware of the perilous situation in France!</p>
<p>"Colonel, I would be very happy to go, but I must act on orders."</p>
<p>"I can speak to the command about this."</p>
<p>The commander sent Captain Hammond, and after some discussion with him, it was decided that I would fly to London by military aircraft on June 10. However, the military situation was becoming increasingly unfavorable. Finally, German tanks were directly approaching the outskirts of Paris. The government always said it would defend the capital to the death, but on June 9, I passed the naval department and saw sailors loading huge covered wagons.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the morning on June 10, Magilley called to advise me to send my family south.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Is the government moving the capital?"</p>
<p>"Today."</p>
<p>"Isn't Paris supposed to be defended to the death?"</p>
<p>"No longer."</p>
<p>At that time, I felt like a bolt from the blue, knowing that everything was over. France losing Paris was like a body without a head, and the war was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>I was supposed to arrive at the Brook airfield at noon. My wife and I decided to linger one last time in our favorite corner of Paris. We said goodbye to all the famous places. We felt that Paris had never been so beautiful: the sky was clear and cloudless, the air was gentle, and the traffic police on the road were directing vehicles as usual, as if the world was not coming to an end. The female salesclerks in the department stores were still cordially greeting customers. Although everyone's eyes contained a packet of hot tears, everyone was still doing their jobs as usual, never mentioning this great tragedy.</p>
<p>My wife said, "The French civilians are truly great! They are simple, brave, and have both. How can such people be defeated?"</p>
<p>I replied, "How can flesh and blood withstand machines? They are ordered to defend the front line, so they should obey the order to defend it, but the front line is under attack, and the enemy has outflanked them and surrounded them."</p>
<p>She said, "I still don't believe the German army will enter Paris..."</p>
<p>A few days earlier, our close friend, military doctor Martel, had discussed with us the matter of the German army entering Paris. He said to us, "I have made up my mind: as soon as I hear the news of the enemy entering the city, I will immediately draw my sword and commit suicide." Then he explained that most people do not know how to commit suicide, which results in being half-dead. However, military doctors use guns as skillfully as they use scalpels, always hitting the vital point without fail. He also half-jokingly said, "If you don't want to live either, I can take care of it..."</p>
<p>At ten o'clock that night, I had already flown to England. My wife was still looking worried, sorting out the miscellaneous items to carry with her, when suddenly the phone rang, causing her to stop.</p>
<p>The caller was Martel. He said, "I want to know if you and Mr. Mole are still in Paris."</p>
<p>She replied, "He has been ordered to fly to London, and I will leave Paris at dawn tomorrow."</p>
<p>His tone was somewhat strange, saying, "I am leaving, but the journey will be much farther than yours..." My wife suddenly remembered his conversation and knew that he was about to commit suicide, so she wanted to persuade him to change his mind. She said, "You still have many things you can do. Your patients, your assistants, your nurses, all need your care..."</p>
<p>Martel said, "I can't live any longer. I only had one son, who died in the last war. I have always comforted myself by believing that he sacrificed himself to save France. Now France is about to be lost again. Everything I have relied on to survive is about to leave me. I really can't live any longer."</p>
<p>As she was about to continue to persuade him, he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Later, on June 25, the speedboat my wife was on stopped at Arcoa and read an American newspaper reporting that Martel had injected 　素 to commit suicide when the German army entered Paris.</p>
<p>Martel's death caused us to lose a confidant and France to lose its noblest figure. This military doctor was truly a gentleman. The money he had saved was used to maintain his free clinic, where countless people had been treated by him. I know that he had used his unique surgery to save an enemy who had been jealous and hateful of him for many years from death. He had shown hundreds of times the moral courage he possessed in body and mind. Such a warrior was unwilling to live a life of ignominious survival, which can also serve as a portrayal of the great misfortune and chaos caused by France's plight.</p>
<p>When the Allied forces were retreating along the Weimann Avenue from Flanders, a French farm woman witnessed the continuous passage of refugees at the door and said sadly to me:</p>
<p>"It's so pitiful, Captain! Such a great power..."</p>
<p>Afterwards, upon hearing the news of Martel's death, it was my turn to say "It's so pitiful." It would have been easy for France to manufacture or purchase five thousand tanks and ten thousand aircraft, but due to procrastination and failure to do so in time, such a person was allowed to hold a grudge in the netherworld, and such a culture was destroyed. Thinking of this, how can one not be filled with pain and anger? (The End)</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow; Additional Tax Case to Be Debated; British and Japanese Nationals File Severe Amendments; All Parties Hope to Overturn the Original Motion for Additional Taxes</h3>
<p>The special meeting of taxpayers in the Public Concession, convened by the leading consuls to discuss the special case of additional taxes, has been decided to be held tomorrow (Thursday) at 2:30 PM in the grandstand of the racetrack. At that time, the motion to increase the property tax by 40% and raise license fees, proposed by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, will be submitted to the meeting for discussion. After learning that the Municipal Council intends to increase taxes again, taxpayers inside and outside the concession were shocked by the unbearable burden and unanimously hoped that the meeting could be mindful of the people's strength and reject the additional tax motion to overcome the difficult times. This is especially true for the Chinese.</p>
<p>British and Japanese Nationals Propose Amendments</p>
<p>On the British national side, Li Dell proposed and Arlington seconded that the Municipal Council be asked to reassess the tax rates on landowners' self-used properties and undeveloped land within the concession in order to reduce the burden on middle and lower-class taxpayers. It is said that all parties sympathize with this suggestion. On the Japanese national taxpayer side, it is said that an opposition motion has also been passed, proposed by Lin Xiongji (Chairman of the Japanese National Taxpayers' Association and Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Street Federation) and seconded by Fukuda, asking the meeting to request the Municipal Council to accept the Japanese amendment, abandoning the original motion to increase the current amount of municipal general tax and land tax by 40%, and replacing it with the following suggestion, "The Municipal Council should continue to implement reductions and reforms, and fundamentally study the possibility of reforming the current taxation system. The proportion of tax payments should be determined according to the ability of each citizen instead of the current system of obtaining most of the tax revenue from land tax and municipal taxes, so that the taxation system is fairer. Until such a system can be realized, the financial shortfall should be made up by borrowing."</p>
<p>Chairman Explains Financial Situation</p>
<p>Chairman Keeswick has now prepared a lengthy speech, clarifying the real difficulties in reducing expenditures for various administrations within the concession, and that the council's recent increase in living allowances has put the council's finances in an even more difficult situation, so it is necessary to increase taxes and appeal to taxpayers to pass it. However, the number of Japanese nationals at this meeting is quite large, and the future is still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>名女作家　史特朗　過滬返美</h3>
<p>Miss Anna Louis Strong, a famous American female writer, was the most eye-catching of the passengers on the Tahutu President, which arrived in Shanghai last night. Ms. Strong recently traveled from Chongqing to Hong Kong, then took this ship via Shanghai back to the United States. While in Chongqing, she paid respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and senior officials of the Chinese government. According to her, the trip to Chongqing left her with a deep impression. The spirit of the Chinese soldiers and civilians is exceptionally vigorous. In fact, 99% of the Chinese people are making every effort to fight to the end.</p>
<p>This spirit will surely enable China to achieve final victory. Ms. Strong has visited China many times to conduct research. Using the materials she collected in China, she wrote two books, "Four Hundred Million Customers" and "One-Fifth of Mankind". Before going to Chongqing, she traveled in the Soviet Union for a long time. She said that the Soviet Union has prepared all measures to deal with contingencies, but strives for neutrality and does not want to participate in the European war. However, regarding the war in the Far East, the Soviet Union is already supporting China.</p>
<p>Japan's attempt to use a non-aggression pact as bait to induce the Soviet Union to stop providing China with various munitions and raw materials is entirely wishful thinking. After all, the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is completely different from that between Japan and the Soviet Union. According to Ms. Strong's observation, the current friendship between China and the Soviet Union is as solid as that between China and Britain and the United States. Japan's situation is now very critical, because it is surrounded by China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. If it does not pull back from the brink and quickly change its foreign policy, its future is worrying.</p>
<p>Ms. Strong went to Germany for investigation in June last year, stayed in Germany for several weeks, then went to Moscow, stayed in the Soviet Union for several months, and then went to Chongqing. Her footprints spread across Europe and Asia, so she is familiar with the general situation. The above observations are based on practical experience, indicating the favorable international situation of China and the bright future of the war. Ms. Strong will stay in Shanghai for one day and night, and is scheduled to take the original ship back to the United States at 6:30 this afternoon, first inspect in San Francisco, and then go to Washington DC.</p>
<h3>自滬赴甬流動商人　應懲收營業稅</h3>
<p>Mobile merchants traveling from Shanghai to various parts of eastern Zhejiang are increasing daily. The Ningbo Business Tax Collection Bureau, in view of this, believes that this temporary business tax should be collected in accordance with regulations to benefit tax sources. In order to adapt to the facts, the import and export measures will be re-determined to facilitate adaptation.</p>
<h3>美商會發強烈呼籲　協助美國商團　在上海現存緊急狀況下　美商團之職責異常重大</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai issued a strong appeal today (the 21st), addressed to the managers of various American business firms and American merchants, requesting that all American expatriates assist in establishing the American team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The article stated that American expatriates should have a deeper understanding of the importance of the service of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, especially under the current emergency situation in Shanghai. The patrol mission of the "B" defense zone in the Public Concession makes the responsibilities of the Volunteer Corps increasingly heavy. Even without considering this, in a better situation, the service of the Volunteer Corps is very familiar to the young people of the American expatriate community in Shanghai. However, American business owners have not cooperated with employees who want to take leave to work for the Volunteer Corps, and have even refused to grant them permission. The reason why business owners do not encourage their employees must be entirely due to their ignorance of the value of the Volunteer Corps' service.</p>
<h3>廣慈醫院職工　昨晚全體復工　九家出差汽車司機提要求　商務同人昨午休息一小時</h3>
<p>Guangci Hospital, located at 197 Jin Shenfu Road, was founded two years before the founding of the Republic of China by Catholic priests and is directly under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church on Tianzhutang Street, Yangjingbang. It is deeply trusted by all walks of life. It has more than ten staff members, more than one hundred and fifty male workers, more than one hundred female workers, five foreign doctors, and more than 20 Chinese doctors, with more than 1,200 beds. Since the labor side asked for improved treatment on the 30th of last month, but was not invited to be approved, it was forced to leave the hospital. The two sides have been in a stalemate for 22 days. The labor side has been running around and appealing, suffering a lot. Now, at 4 pm yesterday, all employees formally resumed work.</p>
<p>Conditions for resumption of work at Guangci</p>
<p>It is learned that the hospital has agreed to the eight conditions proposed by the labor side: (1) All employees resume work; (2) Wages during the strike period are paid as usual; (3) The minimum wage is increased by 15 yuan across the board; (4) Employees shall not be dismissed without cause. Other conditions will be negotiated openly. The labor side is satisfied, so all employees formally resumed work yesterday.</p>
<p>Requests from Car Drivers</p>
<p>All drivers from nine Class A car companies in this city, including Yitai, Benning, Sichuan, Meihua, Jiangsu, Kade, Dakang, Zhonghua, and Fuzhou, have jointly submitted a request to the capital side on the 16th of this month, because their monthly wages are only between 20 and 40 yuan, which is difficult to maintain in this time of high prices: (1) Increase wages by 75% to 100%; (2) Increase rice subsidy by 10 to 20 yuan; (3) Living allowance of 75%; (4) Annual bonus of three months. They also negotiated with the capital side once the day before yesterday, but there was no result because the capital side rejected the request. Now the labor side has decided to hold a joint conference this morning to discuss solutions and urge the capital side to respond as soon as possible in order to maintain the spirit of cooperation between labor and capital.</p>
<p>Commercial Temporary Break</p>
<p>The colleagues' association of the Commercial Press held a one-hour break from 10 am to 11 am yesterday to protest the authorities' issuance of dismissal, non-renewal, and transfer measures. At that time, all departments' operations were suspended. Wooden signs explaining the reasons were placed at the entrance and inside the hall, and declarations were distributed. The order was good. Operations resumed after 11 am. According to the representative of the colleagues' association, their purpose is only to urge the authorities to cancel the three measures of dismissal, etc., and to improve the lives of colleagues, and are willing to resolve the matter through reasonable procedures so as not to allow any party to take advantage of the situation. It is now decided to wait quietly for the authorities to respond in the short term.</p>
<p>International Hotel Dispute</p>
<p>The labor-capital dispute at the International Hotel, located at 164 Jing'an Temple Road in this city, was once openly negotiated by representatives from both sides the day before yesterday afternoon, but no satisfactory agreement was reached. Yesterday afternoon at 3 pm, negotiations continued, and the capital side gave a copy of the speech draft as a response to the main points. The labor side unanimously opposed it, leading to a breakdown in negotiations. Yesterday, according to a responsible person from the store, they decided to wait for a peaceful resolution and planned not to take any out-of-bounds actions, so they hoped that the capital side would properly mediate to avoid the expansion of the situation.</p>
<p>Paint Industry Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the paint workers in this city went on strike on the evening of the 18th, there have been no major conflicts. However, the capital side has still not made any expression of resolution. The strike is still continuing. Yesterday afternoon, the workers in the industry petitioned various capital sides separately, begging them to understand the workers' pain and give them increased wages for meals in order to maintain their livelihood, and hoping to resolve the matter as soon as possible, and appealed to all walks of life.</p>
<h3>法公董局決　嚴峻遏制物價　俟法總領署核準即實行</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Times", yesterday (the 20th), it was learned that the prices of various commodities in this city have repeatedly soared, reaching new heights. The French Concession Public Works Bureau is planning to take strict new measures to curb the unreasonable rise in the selling price of basic foods. The Price Investigation Committee of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, after several weeks of close study, has drafted several recommendations for controlling selling prices, which will be submitted to the French Consulate General for research. Once approved, the Public Works Bureau will implement restrictions on rising prices. The items whose selling prices will be controlled include thirty kinds of food, such as rice, flour, coal briquettes, firewood, charcoal, oil, and food.</p>
<p>Flat Price Flour Being Negotiated</p>
<p>Last year, the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills provided flat-price flour, which benefited the general real users not shallowly. The authorities expressed great admiration. Regarding the matter of selling flour at a flat price this year, as a result of negotiations between the authorities and the factory, each package of factory stock is 21 yuan and 50 cents. Fuxin supplies 3,100 packages every day, and Fufeng supplies 1,059 packages. However, this method is limited to January 6 to 25 (excluding Sundays). As for the flour price and quantity during the Lunar New Year, although the authorities and Fuxin Factory and others are negotiating, they have not yet been finalized. In the blink of an eye, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the supply of flour from the two factories will inevitably stop for many days at that time. It is hoped that general users will purchase as soon as possible before the New Year to meet their needs and prepare. In addition, the machine-made noodles industry presented a request to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, requesting the sale of flat flour from the border area so that the civilians in the border area can also get flat-price noodles.</p>
<p>Seven Hundred Thousand Bags of Foreign Rice Will Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired about the rice industry in this city and learned that from the middle of February to the end of March this year, a large batch of foreign rice produced in Saigon, Siam, Yangon, and other places will be shipped, totaling more than 700,000 bags. Namely, British merchant Heyi Foreign Company's February shipment of 1,000 tons, priced at 90 yuan and 2 cents; Jinhua's late January Xiaowen rice 500 tons at 83 yuan, and another 500 tons at 81 yuan; February 1st grade rice 500 tons at 92 yuan; Ding Taihua Company's February price 1st grade rice 2,000 tons at 93 yuan, etc. The above prices are all prices that have been traded in the market, and their arrival prices are still quite low. The Rice and Bean Industry Association decided that: (1) The commission charged by the industry (including rice shops, merchants, etc.) for each stone of rice (domestic rice and foreign rice) shall not exceed 50 cents.</p>
<h3>朱慶瀾功在國家　呈請國葬</h3>
<p>After the death of the late member of the Zhenji Committee, Zhu Qinglan, some time ago in Xi'an, the National Government issued an order of commendation and gave funeral expenses of 5,000 yuan. Yesterday, Zhu's family here received a telegram from Shaanxi, stating that the chairman of Shaanxi, Jiang Dingwen, and military authorities such as Hu Zongnan, jointly submitted a request to the Central Government to grant Zhu a state funeral, because Zhu had made contributions to the country.</p>
<h3>江海關去年份　全年貿易　進出口貨美佔首位　出超六萬二千萬元</h3>
<p>Customs Commissioner Luo Fude of the Jianghai Customs recently announced the foreign trade of the Shanghai Customs in the 29th year of the Republic of China. The value of imported domestic goods was customs gold 27,519,089 gold, equivalent to national currency 74,494,1759 yuan. The value of exported native goods was national currency 136,728,3727 yuan.

The United States ranked first in imports, totaling 23,608,6962 yuan; followed by British India, totaling 12,473,5201 yuan; and then Japan, totaling 6,774,1271 yuan. The United States ranked first in exports, totaling 44,922,3300 yuan; followed by Hong Kong, totaling 20,945,2181 yuan; and then Britain, totaling 15,449,9758 yuan.</p>
<h3>虹口日僑　禁讀反日報紙</h3>
<p>Punishment for those who read without permission. English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" Under Attack The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Japanese-language "Continental News" in this city has repeatedly issued "malicious words" against the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury". Recently, it published an article titled "Newspaper Fashion", criticizing the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" and two English-language morning papers for being anti-Japanese, stating that Japanese expatriates in Hongkou read English-language newspapers</p>
<p>is an unpatriotic and "purely fashionable" act. The Japanese military authorities in this city will take strict measures on this and closely monitor any Japanese expatriate who reads anti-Japanese English-language newspapers without official permission, and punish them severely. The delivery of anti-Japanese English-language and Chinese-language newspapers to Hongkou has "automatically stopped." In the future, only those who work in the newspaper industry or civil servants can subscribe to these after obtaining permission from the military authorities.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Newspapers</p>
<p>Many Japanese expatriates read these newspapers purely out of fashion, and discard them in public places such as trams and buses after reading them, which will have a bad impact on Chinese and Japanese expatriates in Hongkou. However, it is believed that the Japanese military circles here today (the 21st) have not imposed any prohibition on the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury". It is said that English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" is still freely sold at newsstands in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>美經濟凍結政策　日將遭受威脅　不特喪失外滙購貨資源　對中立國家亦無法貿易</h3>
<p>Regarding the section of the draft plan of the US Treasury Department to freeze the funds of the Axis powers in the United States, which can be implemented after President Roosevelt approves it, I once asked an economist in this port about the impact of this matter. According to him, most of the world's materials are within the scope of the US dollar and the British pound. The United Kingdom has vast colonies and abundant resources. The United States ranks first in the world in terms of industrial production, agricultural production, and mining production. Since the outbreak of the European war, the exchange rate of the British pound has fluctuated, and import and export trade has also been controlled. As a result, the foreign trade of various countries in the world has concentrated in the United States, and the US dollar has become the only free currency in the world. The settlement of international trade is based on the US dollar, so many countries transport their gold to the United States and see it as US dollars, which are used as foreign funds to balance their own currency exchange rates and purchase US industrial products. If the United States gives economic blows to the invading countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan and freezes their funds in the United States, the Axis powers will not only lose their sources of foreign exchange and materials, but also their trade with neutral countries will be hit. For example, if Japan wants to purchase wheat from Argentina and cotton from Brazil, it must use US dollars, because those countries are unwilling to accept Japanese yen. After all, the Japanese yen group has no important position and effect in the world currency market in reality. At this point, if Japan wants to maintain trade with neutral countries, there is only the way of bartering goods. Freezing funds is just one aspect of the United States' dealing with invading countries. In the future, there will inevitably be other economic sanctions to accompany it. Japan's foreign trade now completely relies on the United States. The pressure of the US economy will have a very significant impact on Japan. According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", according to an article by an economist Arles in this port, yesterday (Tuesday) noon, another telegram came saying that Wall Street in New York believed that the US government would not close foreign deposits in the short term, and the matter returned to calm. But it can also be said that it was only slightly delayed. It has been rumored for two months that the funds deposited in the United States by Shanghai banks are being frozen, and it is not entirely without basis. In a certain period, Song Ziwen did discuss this matter seriously with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. According to his plan, anyone in Shanghai who has US currency deposited in any country's bank will not be allowed to withdraw money unless they have been specially approved by the US government to be granted a license. The purpose is to eliminate speculation and prevent the devaluation of legal tender.</p>
<h3>商民宜自行戒備　保護財物　帶款須格外留意　防盜匪跟踪刦掠</h3>
<p>The Public Concession police authorities hope that Chinese merchants and residents within the concession will assist the authorities during this period, take precautions on their own, and protect their property to avoid robberies. When transporting large amounts of money, be especially careful. It is reported that thieves are often paying attention outside the bank. When they see people taking money out, they will follow them to a secluded place and rob them of their property. Now is the final accounting period, and precautions should be taken.</p>
<h3>美僑婦女製繃帶　餽贈英軍</h3>
<p>American women work very excitedly, and women from various countries also join. According to Dalu News, yesterday (the 20th), it was learned that the American Women's Work Association in this city has an "American Studio" located at 9 Jia'erye Road in the French Concession, which produces 2,000 rolls of bandages every month, as well as arm sling bandages, "T"-shaped bandages, and multi-tail bandages, 400 pieces each, and donates them to the British army. It is reported that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once used this studio as a bedroom, and then Mrs. Heilmich, the American Attorney General in China, donated it to the American Women's Work Association. The association was originally organized by many American women, but now many foreign women in Shanghai have also joined as members, and many of the original members have left Shanghai during the American evacuation. The number of members once decreased to five women, but there are many other American and other foreign women who are very interested in this, so the number of members has now increased to 35. They purchase materials from the British Women's Public Association on a regular basis, make them into bandages, and return them to the British Women's Public Association.</p>
<p>Shipping to London and Singapore, the British Women's Public Association has also proposed to provide the materials themselves, and the American Women's Work Association only needs to make them into bandages. However, the American Women's Work Association hopes to fund the purchase of materials, and it is still the same. Although the monthly cost has increased from 200 yuan to 800 yuan, it has not changed its original intention. However, the number of bandages produced by the work association is increasing day by day, and the expenses are all borne by the members, so it has appealed to the American expatriates in this city for donations. The work association was established last spring and plans to continue working until it is no longer needed. Women who join the association go to the studio from 2 pm to 5 pm every Sunday to collect materials and return to their residences to make bandages.</p>
<h3>電車加價已準備　盼速制止</h3>
<p>Since the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession, on the pretext of foreign exchange relations, has been approved by the Public Works Bureau to re-implement price increases from the 26th of this month, that is, the Lunar New Year's Eve, the company has now rushed to print a large number of newly revised fare lists for each route, which will be posted in the carriages of various lines of trams and trolleybuses. However, the public in this port believes that the residents' burden has already been heavy due to the repeated price increases of trams after the war, so they very much hope that the company will still actively rectify its business and stop the events of taking kickbacks and corruption in order to increase revenue and reduce fares, so as to reduce the burden on residents.</p>
<h3>舊歷元旦浦江高潮</h3>
<p>According to the prediction of the Junpu General Bureau, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River on the 27th of this month (that is, the Lunar New Year's Day), and its quantity will reach 10 feet and 005 points. The starting time is around 1 pm. If there is wind and rain, the roads will see the tide surge up.</p>
<h3>工部局一年來重要行政概述（四）</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Rental</p>
<p>In January of last year, according to the request of the Rickshaw Industry Association for permission to increase rickshaw rental in order to maintain it, after detailed consideration, it was decided to increase the rickshaw rental from 7.7 cents to 8.3 cents per day from February 1. At the same time, the minimum amount of rickshaw fare was increased from 8 cents to 1 dime. In June, the Bureau established a special rickshaw subcommittee to conduct a comprehensive study of the current situation of the rickshaw industry in this port. From July 20, the rickshaw rental was increased again by 1.5 dimes per day. From July, the subsidy to the rickshaw drivers' mutual aid association was approved to be increased by 5 dimes per month per rickshaw, and at the same time, the citizens were urged to understand the lives of rickshaw drivers and appropriately increase rickshaw fares so that rickshaw drivers could cope with the higher rickshaw rentals.</p>
<p>Increase in Tuition Fees</p>
<p>It was found that the expenses of the schools established by the Bureau have increased sharply due to high prices, so a surcharge of 25% on the tuition fees of various Western children's schools has been collected since September of the year before last, and a surcharge of 15% on the tuition fees of various Chinese children's schools has been collected since the spring of last year. Later, the prices of goods continued to rise, and the expenses of various schools increased even more, so the Bureau approved the Education Committee's recommendation and raised the surcharge on various Western children's schools to 75% from September of last year. At the same time, the tuition fee of Nie Zhongcheng Public School was increased from 40 yuan to 55 yuan per semester, and the tuition fees of the other four Chinese children's public schools were increased from 48 yuan to 65 yuan. In addition, the tuition fees of various Chinese children's primary schools were generally increased by about 50%.</p>
<p>Refugee Problem</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, there were a total of 28 shelters in the concession, accommodating a total of 33,000 refugees. By the end of the year, the number of shelters had been reduced to 13, and the number of refugees had been reduced to 15,000, so the refugee problem has been greatly improved. The entertainment donations collected by the Bureau from various theaters were allocated to various Chinese and foreign charitable organizations as funding for charitable undertakings. The problem of completely stopping the shelters is still difficult. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Salvation Army, various fellow villager associations, and other charitable organizations have made many contributions to the relief of refugees, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Beggar Accommodation</p>
<p>It was found that accommodating beggars is a major problem, and the Bureau has always paid attention to it. At the annual meeting of taxpayers last year, the Bureau expressed its plan to set up a beggar shelter in order to completely solve the problem of beggars in the concession. The purpose of setting up a beggar shelter is to enable beggars to support themselves and to support them for a long time, allowing this beggar group to exist forever. At the same time, it is hoped that the number of beggars in the concession will gradually decrease. As for the expenses of the shelter, it was initially estimated at 175,000 yuan per year, but later prices rose sharply, and this number will inevitably increase. It was found that the Bureau's financial income is limited by precedent and cannot be transferred to be used for the relief of the poor, so this type of expenses must be given to public donations. It has been clearly explained in the previous article that the Salvation Army is willing to undertake the implementation of beggar relief work. At the same time, the Shanghai Rotary Club is generous in taking the disposal of the beggar problem as its own responsibility and agrees to set up a committee to handle the receipt and distribution of donations, which is commendable.

Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal First Tribunal of the Special First Court, where Judge Feng Shide questioned them. The police lawyer Li Zhishan said that there were many accomplices involved in this case, who were being strictly pursued, and the case was extremely complicated and required further investigation, so he requested permission to detain them and reschedule the hearing for two weeks. The defendants then hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After questioning, Judge Feng ordered them to be detained and rescheduled the hearing for two weeks.</p>
<h3>市民習谷難移　依然注重廢歷　外輪將於年關停航</h3>
<p>It has been 30 years since the establishment of the Republic of China, but the customs of the citizens are difficult to change, and they still pay attention to the old calendar. Foreign shipping circles, in view of the citizens' adherence to old habits and the Lunar New Year approaching, all industries will follow the usual practice of taking holidays, so except for the transportation of goods overseas and other special cases, the rest of the shipping will follow the past practice and temporarily suspend shipping. It is also heard that merchants from various regions have been handling the closing and temporary suspension of purchasing these days, and they must wait until the market opens after the Lunar New Year to handle the goods again. Various cargo ships will also be able to set sail only after the market opens.</p>
<h3>竊盜珠寶箱案　原告不願追究　案已審結定期宣判</h3>
<p>The widow Zhou Shuangmei made a living by selling jewelry. She lived at 51 Hed Road. At about 9 pm on the 5th of this month, one of Zhou's handbags, containing diamond rings and beads worth 40,000 yuan, suddenly disappeared. Later, the police found that Zhou's nephew Zhou Mujin had colluded with Xie Jinliang and Wang Guoyu to mix anesthetic drugs into the tea, causing her to faint, and then rob her of the jewelry.

Under the debate of the defendant's lawyer Wang Shou'an, the court ordered the postponement of the sentencing.</p>
<h3>Medical and Religious Broadcasts: Transforming Negativity into Positivity, Pessimism into Optimism</h3>
<p>The Gospel Radio Station, operating on frequency 760, broadcasts medical and religious programs every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM, hosted by Dr. Wang Wanbai. Previously, they sought submissions from listeners who had life-changing experiences through listening to the broadcasts, inviting them to speak on the radio. This occurred weekly, and the response was overwhelming. People shared how they had transformed from being negative and world-weary to being positive and seeking to save the world, from being sorrowful and tormented to being peaceful and happy. Some even recounted how they had been completely healed from hopeless illnesses, and how conflicting families had found harmony. The submissions were closed after six months, resulting in a collection of twenty-five listener testimonies. Each testimony was prefaced by a short introduction by Dr. Wang, detailing the transformation each individual underwent. The book opens with prefaces by famous figures, both Chinese and Western, and concludes with the editor’s personal testimony, "My Testimony." The complete book has been published as a standalone volume and is available for sale at Guangxie Bookstore on Museum Road and the Guangxue Society Bookstore.</p>
<h3>Woman Beats Her Child to Death: Six-Year-Old Boy Severely Abused; Woman Detained for Homicide</h3>
<p>Xu Jiangshi, a woman from Ningbo, currently 35 years old, residing at No. 52, Lane 498, Huade Road, Hongkou, is accused of repeatedly abusing her six-year-old son, Qianqin, since he came to Shanghai from Ningbo last October.

<h3>New Year's Eve of the Abolished Calendar: Curfew Enforced as Usual</h3>
<p>According to a statement released by the Public Works Department, the curfew will be strictly enforced as usual on New Year's Eve of the abolished calendar. To ensure tight security, all public places are instructed to close by 12:30 AM on the day. According to local custom, every New Year's Eve of the abolished calendar sees massive crowds going to the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road to burn incense, often congesting the area all night long and throwing incense and paper money everywhere, which is likely to cause trouble. Therefore, the Public Works Department has instructed the Hongmiao Temple to close as usual by 12:30 AM on New Year's Eve, and to provide enough incense burners and candle stands for worshippers, to maintain order and prevent fire hazards.</p>
<h3>News from the Art and Calligraphy World</h3>
<p>Yuan Songnian Raises His Prices: Yuan Songnian, a famous Shanghai-based painter of traditional Chinese paintings, creates art that is grand and imposing, possessing an inviolable air. He is truly an outstanding figure among modern painters. Due to the increasing number of requests for his paintings, Yuan has decided to modestly raise his prices after the New Year.

<h3>Finance: Exchange Rate Fluctuations Unstable; Yesterday's Afternoon Market Tightens Again</h3>
<p>The exchange rate market yesterday showed no change in HSBC's listed rates. The black market for British and American currencies was volatile, and operators found it difficult to predict future changes. Speculative activity was mixed today, initially indicating a loosening, with the spot US dollar trading at 5.53125 yuan and the February US dollar at 5.4675 yuan. However, upon hearing news that the US was delaying the implementation of the frozen assets of Axis countries, sentiment temporarily turned bullish, and people shifted from selling to buying. In the afternoon, speculative demand remained high, but foreign banks like the Daybank were willing to sell, albeit slightly. As a result, the spot British exchange rate closed unchanged and the US rate narrowed by 0.03125, with the spot British exchange rate at 3 pence 4.0625 and the US dollar at 5.40625 yuan.</p>

The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 pence 4.375 for British gold and 5.4375 yuan for the US dollar, with the US dollar unchanged and the pound appreciating by 0.03125 compared to the closing price the previous night. This was due to a slight appreciation of the US dollar against the pound. After opening, speculators were mostly on the selling side, dumping a significant amount of near and far term US dollars, causing prices to loosen. It was reported that a speculator and an American bank sold February US dollars at 5.46875 yuan. At 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver tax remained unchanged. Later, a few speculators recovered, and the US dollar market rebounded slightly. Internal and external banks were reported to have quoted 5.4375 yuan for February contracts. By noon, with speculators continuing to buy, and although foreign banks continued to supply as before, prices gradually softened. Foreign banks were selling US dollars for the current month to Chinese speculators at 5.4375 yuan. The noon closing price was 3 pence 4.375 for British currency and 5.4375 yuan for the US dollar, the same as the morning opening price.</p>
<p>American Banks Buying, Market Tightens</p>
<p>The afternoon market initially heard of the Central Bank's profit and Japanese merchants' sales, and although speculators continued to sell, prices remained stable. Speculators were reported to have bought current month US dollars at 5.4375 yuan. Later, with American banks also buying, the market was affected and softened. A Sino-Belgian bank was reported to have sold US dollars for the same month to a certain American bank, falling to 5.40625 yuan.

<h3>Cash Absorbed Again; Breaks Through 6,700 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw unstable fluctuations in the gold bullion black market, twisting and turning before rising again. Prices have broken through the 6,700 yuan barrier. It is said that due to a certain communication, the US freezing of Axis assets in the US is not easy to implement immediately. Furthermore, the "Central Reserve Bank" came to absorb the market. The Shanghai gang, who had recently established short positions, suddenly rushed to cover, so even though the Dasheng, Xinfeng, Rencheng, Yong, and draft merchants were strongly selling, they could only balance the market with the Xinyuan, Tianyuan, Dadecheng, Hengji, and Hecheng firms buying. The monetary situation retreated twice to 6,605 yuan, before rising again. In the afternoon, there were even more bullish rumors, and securities firms such as Tong Kang Defu also came to compete to buy. The market opened already flying to 6,700 yuan, and then rose further, reaching 6,735 yuan, eventually closing at 6,723 yuan, up 83 yuan. Based on the February US dollar closing price of 5.375 yuan, the gold price was 6,500 yuan, an increase of 223 yuan. The total daily trading volume was 15,000 taels. Swapping from January to February, buyers were giving approximately 210 yuan to sellers. The price difference between cash and futures contracts narrowed sharply. In the morning, Dacheng sold 70 taels, 30 yuan lower than the futures price. In the afternoon, money changers sold 30 taels, 29 yuan lower. Xiang He bought Shengyuan Yong for 40 taels, only 5 yuan lower, as it was heard that a certain bank was secretly collecting, and those with funds were also rushing to hoard. Gold jewelry rose by 20 yuan to 690 yuan, while Guan Jin and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Gold Bullion Recovers Quickly</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially trended flat, at 9:15 AM, the market price was heard to be 6,630 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Small money changers and retail investors sold, pushing it down to around 6,610 yuan. Xinyuan, Hesheng, Yili, Tianyuan, and Chengji suddenly came to buy, with talk that Shanghai short-sellers were covering. The price then flew up by over 80 yuan, rising to 6,695 yuan. Rencheng Yong, Dafeng, and Xinfeng draft merchants suddenly came to sell, with retail investors also following suit, causing an immediate reaction and falling by 90 yuan, twice falling to 6,605 yuan. The gold store Chengji then began to absorb again, and the short side covered, pushing it up to 6,665 yuan. Draft merchants then sold again, falling to 6,630 yuan, before rising again. The noon closing price was 6,647 yuan. In the afternoon, there was suddenly news that the "Central Reserve Bank" came to absorb, and Shanghai short-sellers were even more eager to cover. Sellers dared not release their holdings, and the price flew up to above 6,700 yuan. The opening price at 2:00 PM had already risen to 6,720 yuan, 73 yuan higher than the noon closing. Xiang He, Tong Kang, and Chengji further advanced to 6,725 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate remained stable. Jinyuan, Yiyuan, and Dafeng retail investors scrambled to sell, and an immediate collapse was seen to 6,660 yuan. It was heard that the next month's US dollar could not be settled at 5.40625 yuan. Hesheng, Xinfeng, Tong Kang Defu, Hengji, Xinyuan, and others fiercely advanced, frantically covering their short positions, once again flying up by 75 yuan, seeing a high price of 6,735 yuan. Not long after, the market closed at 6,723 yuan, a recovery of 83 yuan compared to the previous evening's closing price. There was a fluctuation of 130 yuan throughout the day. The closing price was 6,715 yuan. The selling price of wooden brand gold in cash stores was initially flat with the gold bullion futures price, but ultimately had to be 10 yuan higher. The buying price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. The current spot price remained unchanged without a price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed High at 90 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry and ornaments in gold stores, per tael, was initially listed at 670 yuan by Datong Hang and Xin Tonghang. It rose by 10 yuan at 10:00 AM, and then rose by another 10 yuan at 4:00 PM, reaching 690 yuan (the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan).</p>
<h3>British and American Currencies Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw unstable fluctuations in the gold bullion market, but ultimately closed up by over 80 yuan, so British and American gold pounds also rebounded by 2 yuan. British gold notes remained fixed, and the market price was stable. The US dollar initially retreated to 18.10 yuan, but rose as high as 18.42 yuan in the afternoon, eventually closing at 18.38 yuan, a rebound of 0.18 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rebounded by 0.02 yuan. The supply of Japanese and Korean gold notes suddenly increased, and market prices weakened. The former retreated to 1.57 yuan, and the latter fell to 1.215 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: After a Big Rise, Public Bonds Fall Sharply; The More They Rise, the More They Fall</h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds saw a small rebound in the morning yesterday, due to a sudden rise in rumors. This was followed by a downward trend in the afternoon, which became increasingly severe. After a big rise, the fall was equally drastic. This often happens when the interest payment date approaches. It is said that the Hong Kong gang was selling, and the long positions held by Ding Kang and others were uncertain. With the Lunar New Year approaching, one sale led to a hundred sales, especially for Category A bonds, which fell by 4.435 yuan, the most significant decline. Yesterday, the long positions were slightly reduced in the morning, but Tong Kang was still buying. Tong Shun and Xinfu both absorbed, while Lianxiang, Dafeng, Dahua, and Shunfeng sold. The market price rose slightly. The noon closing was slightly less than 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly emerged, with Ding Kang, Lianhe, and Dakang selling off, Lianyi, Dahua, Le Mao, and Hu Heji sold off after Category C bonds opened at 71.2 yuan, breaking through 71 yuan, then the 70 yuan mark, before stopping at 69 yuan. At that time, Tong Geng Kang massively absorbed, and Runli, Tongshun, Yizhong, Shengchang successively entered the market. Today, only morning trading will be done, and the market will close after delivery in the afternoon, reopening as usual on January 21st. However, at that time, interest will be deducted from the calculation. Yesterday, the total decline ranged from 2.05 yuan to 4.435 yuan, with a trading volume of over 5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading saw 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company stock traded at a price of 19.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The potential for various industrial stocks is good, and prices have also improved. The morning opening market was weak, but soon buyers were actively buying at low prices, and various stocks gradually trended upward. Market sentiment was particularly good at the close.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Bank shares continued to be active, with the Mercantile Bank stock rising another 2 shillings 6 pence to 8 pounds 15 shillings. Chartered Bank stock rose 5 shillings to 11 pounds 2 shillings 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Awaits Spring, Fluctuations Narrowed</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, stabilized slightly yesterday. This was due to the stability of the foreign exchange rate, which brought a sense of calm to the market. However, the market was still dominated by long positions, so the market remained firm. However, actual transactions remained sluggish as usual. Some say this is due to the end of the lunar year. Future fluctuations will likely depend on the year-end, waiting for the spring to decide the outcome. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,420 yuan, and the low price was 1,404 yuan. Today, 190 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Double Horse yarn was extremely mild, with the initial price at 1,416 yuan. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was stable, and long positions released their holdings, gradually falling to 1,406 yuan. However, as soon as the low price appeared, scalpers covered their positions, and new buying sentiment slightly flared up, returning to 1,420 yuan. However, the high price was actually reduced, and short positions became active, falling to 1,404 yuan again. Then, with the gold price rising again, it was pushed up to 1,415 yuan at the close. The half-day trading volume was 6,370 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 220</p>
<p>Traders: 6,150</p>
<p>Total: 6,370</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Stalls</h3>
<p>The current situation of the cotton market is trending towards stagnation. This is because faith in the legal currency is strengthening, leading to a gradual appreciation of the foreign exchange rate. As a result, market sentiment is flat, and transactions have almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Another report states that the New York cotton market initially fell due to southern gangs selling short, but soon rebounded due to favorable conditions for commodity trading and buying by the industry. As a result, closing prices were 3 to 6 points lower than the previous day. Indian cotton was flat, and yesterday, including forecasts, it was down a small half rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: yesterday, all parties were preparing to comfortably spend the year, and were indifferent to market conditions. Therefore, apart from pre-arranged banquets for the end of the year, nothing else was heard.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Bought on the Cheap, Absorption Again</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market stabilized yesterday after falling. The morning opening was weak, and traders watched and waited. Guest brokers and long position holders released hoarded goods at a lower price, but the quantity was very small. The factories did not compromise, so actual users and traders absorbed the cloth cheaply, and the market stabilized again. Some plain white coarse and fine cloth fell by about 0.25 yuan per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth was flat. The total transaction volume on this street was over 300 bolts, with Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo brokers buying 70 to 80 bolts of blue cloth and bleached cloth, and Fujian and Guangdong brokers buying 100+ bolts of pongee, colored cloth, and twill. 1,065 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 22nd and 710 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>The Eastern Cloth Market continued to soften. Plain white cloth and muslin fell by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan. Morning trading for Dragon Head fine cloth was 45.2 yuan, with the minimum price falling to 44.55 yuan. Later, due to a rebound in the tender amount, retail sentiment improved, and the price rose to over 5 yuan, with the closing price at 45.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Expensive Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market slightly improved due to better market sentiment. The association quoted spot prices of 81.8 to 82 yuan for 24 raw white foreign warehouse sugar, up 0.3 yuan. The prices for delivery on February 10th were 82.2 to 82.4 yuan, unchanged. The price for delivery on February 20th was 82.6 yuan. The price for Dutch cotton white BS mark was 80 yuan, and Dutch red was 67 yuan, up 1 yuan.

<h3>Grain: Hoarders of Foreign Rice Take Profits and Sell; Market Prices Drop by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Foreign rice inventories are substantial, with each warehouse having over 450,000 bags. Store inventories and local warehouses are not included in that total. There are also about 100,000 bags waiting to be unloaded in the harbor, and the number of goods en route expected to arrive during the Lunar New Year is also substantial. Overseas prices continue to be consistently high. Yesterday, foreign and Chinese merchants were still peddling, but guest hoarders and firms, who are keen on settlement of accounts, had no intention of placing further orders. Moreover, there was a flood of requests from English-Chinese brokers to sell on the market, as general long-position holders and those who had profited from hoarding hoped to sell in order to settle their accounts. Therefore, despite the insistence of big players on holding firm, spot goods ultimately saw a gradual decline. Although there were no transactions yesterday, market sentiment was very weak, and spot rice was reduced by at least one yuan across the board. High-end goods were reduced by one yuan or more within the limited price range. Only No. 1 Saigon cargo, apart from old goods which have a limited quantity, was still able to hold at the original level of 86 yuan or 85.7 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands went for 84.5 yuan to 83 yuan, No. 2 went for 80.05 yuan to 76.5 yuan. No. 1 old rice was also quite expensive at 85.5 yuan, while new rice was only 83 yuan, followed by 80 yuan. No. 2 was 75.5 yuan, flame-milled went for 82.5 yuan, followed by 81 yuan. The highest price for small-milled early rice was 74 yuan in the early morning, but it ultimately ended at 73 yuan. Premium Tokyo pointed cargo was rare and expensive, with bids being relatively fresh, fetching 74 yuan, 71 yuan. Mid-grade rice went for 68.5 yuan, 68 yuan, premium broken rice ranged from 66.5 yuan to 57.5 yuan for No. 3, 57 yuan. The small-milled Saigon futures were particularly oversupplied. The price for February small-milled futures opened at 81.5 yuan to 81.25 yuan, which is two yuan lower than the previous market's price of 83-84 yuan. Spot transactions for the entire day amounted to approximately 5,000 bags and futures totaled 400-500 tons. The rice market is only trading for one day today, which indicates a closing atmosphere.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai in an unbroken stream, as has been repeatedly noted in these reports. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson’s Yusheng ship arrived from Hong Kong carrying 15,387 bags, which docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. There are also large quantities of Vietnamese rice loaded on French ships that will be shipped directly from Saigon this month. Large quantities of Burmese rice are also expected to arrive around next month. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>Thick rice from [unclear countries] is scarce and sales are sluggish. The market softened as owners are keenly seeking to sell off their rice. High-grade Changbang original white japonica was priced at 107.5 yuan, Kunshan original package white japonica was 105 yuan, 104 yuan for rice in vats, followed by 101 yuan, Qingjiao original package thin-hulled rice was 101 yuan, Qingjiao was 98.5 yuan and 97.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice trading remains brisk and the business of cake shops is also developing. The market is still able to hold and there's not much fluctuation. Li Yuan remains at 90 yuan, premium Hong Kong is 100 yuan, 78.4 yuan, followed by 75.5 yuan, 75 yuan, Special glutinous rice is 71.5 to 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Closes: Foreign Flour Inventory at 230,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The flour market is showing signs of closing, as all parties are working to wind down ahead of the end of the year. Transactions at the Miscellaneous Grains Association market has already reached the last day. Therefore, spot flour sales are only being made by those on this street who urgently need to stock up, while all the speculation and trading has been settled. Those holding the goods also plan to wait and hold out for the reopening market next year before doing business again. The market remains solid. About 10,000 bags of Flower and Bird Brand flour were priced at 24.35 yuan, opening and rising to 24.6 yuan. The price of newly arrived Blue Mark Flower foreign flour from Hong Kong was 24.4 yuan. There's also a bid for newly arrived Soldier Ship Brand foreign flour which is priced at 24.3 yuan, but no deals have been made. Of the 10,000 bags of foreign flour transported by the Yuezhou ship, only 2,000 bags were Soldier Ship, the rest were Blue Mark Flower. This brand is well-received by local street dealers. More supplies are expected to arrive in batches. The Shanghai flour inventory, including all brands, is about 230,000 bags. The Miscellaneous Grains Association will close for the winter break from today and will resume operations on January 31st.</p>
<p>The wheat market has been quiet for a long time and winding down for the year is approaching. Domestic and foreign sources have been silent for a long time. Most of the inventory is being held and not being sold. Everyone is waiting to hold out for the reopening market after the Lunar New Year. The stocks of wheat at the concessions' warehouses and Wuxi and Changzhou are only about 2,000 bags. The wheat stocks held by the Japanese and Chinese factories are only sufficient for one month's use. Therefore, the future of the wheat market is expected to rise easily and difficult to fall.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Live Pigs Flood the Market, Meat Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>This year’s high meat prices are unusual. Because pigs come from the areas of Jiangbei, Qingshenggang, and Huanggang, they are affected by all sorts of factors. Heavy taxes and holding and manipulation have caused the public to eat "natural vegetarian meals" and avoid meat. Unexpectedly, recently the number of live pigs arriving has been very large. Firstly, pig farmers are eager to sell for cash to meet the demands of the new year, so they sell and transport their pigs to Shanghai. The price of fresh meat was highest during the Winter Solstice Festival, selling for 240 yuan per picul. Subsequently, due to poor sales, the price of went down to 200 yuan per picul. Currently, Shanghai has nearly 10,000 live pigs in stock. The current price of fresh meat has fallen to 160-170 yuan per picul, but retail meat prices in the shops are not willing to lower them due to the Lunar New Year.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Charity Basketball Tournament Concludes: Huaxing Wins Third Game Against Mailing Last Night; 51 to 46, 18 to 18 at Halftime; Tense Situation, Huaxing Has Excellent Performance</h3>
<p>The last game of the charity basketball tournament hosted by Huaxing Sports Association last night saw Huaxing defeat Mailing with an excellent performance, winning all three games. The final score was 51 to 46, with the halftime score tied at 18 to 18. Mailing played with an officer team last night, hoping to win the third game, but they still failed to achieve their goal. However, Henshawitz's individual technical performance was superb and admirable. Unfortunately, Henshawitz committed three fouls in the first half, and he did not dare to work too hard in the second half. This is also one of the reasons for the victory. Huaxing had excellent coordination last night, and their shooting was as smooth as if they were divinely assisted. Apart from Henshawitz, none of the other Mailing players performed well. In the women's performance before the game, Lanxing lost to Ailing Villa 25 to 17 because they were not used to the men's rules in the second half. Lanxing took the lead 13 to 8 in the first half, as they were using the women's rules. After the game, Ms. Jin Suqin, a famous actress, presented the awards.</p>
<p>Game Summary</p>
<p>After the tip-off, Xue Chong opened the scoring, and Huaxing took a 6 to 0 lead. Unexpectedly, Mailing scored 12 consecutive points, taking the lead instead. When the score was 15 to 11, Henshawitz committed his third foul. Huaxing gradually caught up, and Hongbin's long shot put them ahead 18 to 17. Mailing made a free throw, and the halftime score became 18. In the second half, Hongbin scored two, and Bao Songyuan and Li Zhenzhong scored consecutively, and from then on, they went smoothly, leading all the way. When the score was 41 to 34, Henshawitz showed his strength again, chasing the score to 41 to 40. However, Xue Chong and Hongbin scored again, and Mailing finally lost 51 to 46.</p>

The Hua team has strong players such as Wang Lie and Li Zaichun. The battle was very exciting, especially the game between Ying Houjun, a young player of Jianmin team who is only one or two years old, and Li Feixiang, the main player of Hualian, which was very tense and won a lot of applause.

<h3>Haircuts and Baths</h3>
<p>— Gao Yang</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>In the morning, as I picked up my bowl of porridge, my mother instructed me, "Sun, your hair is really too long. It looks like 'long hair,' which is quite unsightly. Go get it cut off today!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mom, the school will be less crowded today. I'll go get it cut this afternoon!"</p>
<p>As I said this, I finished two bowls of porridge with a "slurp, slurp" sound, grabbed the newspaper, and left.</p>
<p>On the way, I passed by the "barbershop" entrance. The signboards were tightly closed, and there was a note posted outside, saying, "Our friends (the barbers) are demanding a raise and are suspending business for a few days, until,..."</p>
<p>However, another barbershop on the same street was already "open for business." A dark mass of long-haired friends were crowding inside.</p>
<p>Although I myself had "long hair," it was more important to get to school.</p>
<p>I busied myself all day, and at five-thirty, I hurried home again. A day's time had slipped away from my hands unnoticed. As soon as I got home, my mother urged me to get a haircut.</p>
<p>Actually, I found this "thing" to be quite a hassle. It meant wasting more than an hour sitting in a chair to enjoy it. However, if you added up the losses of thousands or tens of thousands of people, the time statistics would probably be an alarming number! But in order not to annoy others, I still had to groom myself a bit.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the barbershop, it was filled with people.</p>
<p>"Sir, there will be space soon. Please sit and wait!" Then the apprentice offered me a cup of tea, a cigarette, and a hot towel. So I had no choice but to sit there and wait like a sick person. It wasn't polite to "leave."</p>
<p>When there was an opening, I filled it, and finally it was my turn.</p>
<p>"Sir, today is our first day back at work. Some bosses aren't willing to give us a raise, so they haven't started yet!" he said as he unbuttoned my collar and put on the white cloth.</p>
<p>"So, how much of a raise are you getting?" I asked casually.</p>
<p>"We work on a 'split account' basis. It used to be a '3-7 split,' but now it's changed to a '4-6 split.' It's really hard to make ends meet these days, sir!"</p>
<p>After going through the whole routine, an hour and a half had already passed.</p>
<p>"Sir, don't be polite!" the barber muttered in my ear as I opened my paper wallet.</p>
<p>I gave him fifty cents, and he said, "Sir, today it's seventy cents. Please take a look at that note!" He pointed to the glass window.</p>
<p>"Oh, so that's how they're raising their wages!" I realized to myself.</p>
<p>In the end, the power of "long hair" is great - the numbers added up on everyone's heads are alarming!</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>After the haircut, my parents told me to take a bath. "Ah, today is really a bad day!"</p>
<p>I grabbed my clothes and rushed to the bathhouse.</p>
<p>As I entered, it was a red "alley of flesh." The room was filled with steam, instantly obscuring the glass in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>"There are no empty seats. You'll have to sit and wait!" the attendant replied coldly. He probably didn't recognize me as a regular customer.</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll just have to wait today!" So I decided to settle down.</p>
<p>It was hard to wait until my turn. After taking a bath and coming out, I saw a dish of olives (commonly known as "yuanbao," which symbolize wealth) and a dish of peeled oranges on the table next to me. I was glad that they didn't give these things to me, or else my paper wallet would be embarrassed.</p>
<p>Other people were paying with five-dollar bills, but I only had fifty cents, so I wouldn't get any tea or towels.</p>
<p>On the way home, I thought of what the barber had said, "These are bad days, sir!"</p>
<h3>A Fighting Outlook on Life (40)</h3>
<p>Hesitation leads to missed opportunities, hesitation breeds laziness. Hesitation is the poison of failure. A fighter gives serious consideration to final decisions, to avoid regret, but will never allow consideration to drag on, nor delay making decisions. Every decision is not the final one, and therefore should never remain stuck at the stage of consideration.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Don't rush, Mr. Yu... you're probably only forty-two years old this year, right? Thirty-one years ago, you were only about ten years old. How could you have changed someone's stage name?"</p>
<p>This question really stumped the Pingju master. A trace of red unusually appeared on his pale yellow face, which was usually full of smoke.</p>
<p>"Oh! I misremembered!" He tried hard to correct himself: "It was eleven years ago, not thirty-one years ago..."</p>
<p>Yuan Shaowen couldn't help but smile. But today he was the host, and the young man in the Western suit, Zhang Tianming, was his classmate. Of course, he was too embarrassed to continue putting Yu Zhongqian in an awkward position, so he immediately brought up another topic of conversation.</p>
<p>"Tianming, what do you think of how our third uncle is treating Yuqin now?"</p>
<p>"Not bad," the young man in the Western suit adjusted his scarlet tie and replied. "It doesn't seem as mushy as before! That's all thanks to your hard work from the sidelines."</p>
<p>"But three years ago, Liu Yuhua, a student in the Yuzhen class, also gave him a very powerful lesson!" Shaowen said with a smile.</p>
<p>"After Liu Yuhua was expelled from the Yuzhen class, I heard she's been performing in the South. I wonder if there's any news from Boss Qiu's side?" Yu Zhongqian interjected and asked.</p>
<p>Shaowen took out a stack of banknotes to settle the bill and answered very briefly:</p>
<p>"I haven't heard him mention it."</p>
<p>Just then, a bald head poked in through the curtain. As soon as they saw him, the three people in the room recognized him.</p>
<p>"Rongkui, are you here to urge your boss to go to the restaurant? He's already left with Yuan the Garrison Commander!" Zhang Tianming always rushed to speak first.</p>
<p>Rongkui was Qiu Haitang's attendant. He was indeed here to urge the performance. Hearing what Tianming said, he hurriedly said yes and was about to turn around and go back. (15)</p>
<h3>Tiger's Gall Gold Pearl (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xiu Bi</p>
<p>——Street Vignette</p>
<p>So, under the gaze of many people, he opened the package. He laid the package flat on the ground and then slowly opened it.</p>
<p>One by one, black, woody, hard things, like olives, were clearly seen by the audience.</p>
<p>"What is this?" the man asked the audience, pointing vigorously at the package on the ground: "Olives! Many friends will definitely answer that way. Don't we even know what olives are? Haha!"</p>
<p>But what are they really? An explanation is coming.</p>
<p>"Haha! If they were really olives, wouldn't I be crazy to bring them here? Can't you all just go to the fruit store to buy them? Let me tell you, this is not an olive, what is it?"</p>
<p>What is it? Here it comes again:</p>
<p>"It's a long story. Four years ago, I traveled to Tianmu Mountain and met an old monk. We talked about the scriptures and became very close. So the old monk took me to see a tree, a tree that grew so many of these things... and a ring."</p>
<p>Suddenly, he took out a wooden ring from his pocket.</p>
<p>"Was this made by a carpenter? Not at all! Hmph, this wooden ring is natural. It grows on the tree on Tianmu Mountain! At both ends of the ring, there are two of these things that look like olives. Look, everyone, there are still joints on the ring. If you don't believe me and say I'm 'talking nonsense,' feel free to go to Tianmu Mountain and ask the old monk."</p>
<p>Fortunately, Tianmu Mountain is very far away. The man continued to shout without blinking:</p>
<p>"What are these things called? They're called 'Tiger's Gall Gold Pearl'. As long as you hold one in your hand, poisonous snakes will turn away from afar. If you're bitten by a snake, you just need to apply this thing to the wound, and you'll recover immediately. As for the price, to be honest, my purpose is to help people, not to make money. If you have a lot of money in your pocket, be generous and give ten or eight yuan. I'll give you a few more. Poor friends, economical friends, if you don't have money, then two or three dimes will get you a few less... Everyone, it's all good karma that you met me today!"</p>
<p>The people around him listened to a long speech, and now they finally heard the result. Some started to walk away, while others took out money to buy the "Tiger's Gall Gold Pearl." A maid-like person gave him two dimes.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law! If you have more money in your pocket, you might as well buy some more."</p>
<p>"I don't have any more. I'll just take a few for now."</p>
<p>A "knight" in black gave him a yuan. He waved the banknote in his hand and shouted: "You're a really generous friend. You must be making a fortune!"</p>
<p>One...</p>
<p>One...</p>
<p>Before long, the big bag of "Tiger's Gall Gold Pearls" was all sold out, and the people gradually dispersed, leaving only the man, some children, and the snake drawn with chalk on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I'm going to die of joy! People in Shanghai are really easy to fool." The man carefully wrapped up the coins and banknotes and put them in his pocket. He also started to walk away, thinking this in his heart as he walked.</p>
<p>"In the whole world, which sly business doesn't rely on deception? And in Shanghai, it's especially true. Those big bosses, rich old men, handsome young men, and flirtatious girls, who isn't scheming and deceiving all day long?" These thoughts circled in his mind. Haha!"</p>
<p>Thinking this way, he felt very at ease and satisfied. His posture as he walked also seemed wobbly and completely happy.</p>
<p>And on that sidewalk, which was just very crowded, now only the snake drawn in chalk was facing the way, raising its head and wagging its tail, as if greeting the passersby. (The End)</p>

<h3>On Wu Tian's Adaptation of "The Family"</h3>
<p>— Anyang</p>
<p>Wu Tian's adaptation of "The Family" can be said to be very faithful to Ba Jin's original work. Naturally, many trivial details are omitted. This is, after all, the difference between "dramatic" and "novelistic."</p>
<p>The tightly linked and circuitous development, evolution, and struggle within the crumbling feudal family, Wu Tian grasped the ideological consciousness without loosening. Therefore, it is easy to understand the theme, and at the same time, it is also helpful to highlight the typical characters. Because by reflecting the phenomena of their surrounding lives through the typical characters, we are already easily able to accept and understand the concepts contained in this life.</p>
<p>Drama is an art of creation. It does not mechanically explain the theme with formulas. It is gradually groped out. It goes through a complex and tortuous journey. This is the problem of adapting a script. Here, we have found that Wu Tian is able to extract gold from the trivial and complex sand.</p>
<p>The most excellent aspect of the technique is creating a strong tragic atmosphere, making it suffocating. Death is certainly the highest point of tragedy, but there must be entanglements before death. Just like Mingfeng's death, before her death, we found that she had gained a savior, which made us relax, thinking that she could be saved. But she told us that this savior was too late and useless. She still died. In this tense atmosphere, it seems to relax on the surface, but in fact, it stimulates the tense emotions and has a penetrating peak. This is just one example in "The Family."</p>
<p>The handling of typical characters is quite clever. Here, we see sympathetic characters, and we also see hateful characters. Moreover, we also see the author deepening, expanding, and endowing them with keenness and clarity, making those characters' personalities real and clear. Here, we find that the technique is to form it with "opposition." Wu Tian not only deliberately describes an image itself, but he can skillfully use opposite images to contrast it. He can also use the same image to set it off. There are people behind the bright characters, and there are people behind the dark characters. This tragedy is so fast, circuitous, and struggling.</p>
<p>The development of the whole play proceeds slowly from the first act, and the middle is circuitously moving forward until the end. The climax is appropriate, and it does not make people feel abrupt or dull.</p>
<p>I wish "The Family" a successful performance!</p>
<h3>Zhangtai Willow</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>She walked out into the courtyard in a simple white dress. When the crowd saw her coming, they shouted, "Madam Liu, how will you settle the debts that the minister owed?" Liu Rushi said to them very gently. "I acknowledge the debts that the minister owed you. These are the things that the minister did, and they have nothing to do with his children. With me here, please just give me some time, and I will definitely pay them off. Why do you have to shout and cause trouble, and bully orphans and widows?" On the one hand, everyone heard what she said, which was righteous and just. On the other hand, they had already agreed to return the debts, and the debts had an owner and would not be lost. The fierce flames were slightly restrained, and they all said that as long as Madam Liu could return the debts, that would be enough. However, half of the people still gathered in the doorway and refused to leave. Among them, there was a scoundrel named He Si, whose nickname was White Flower Snake. The people he gathered followed him and did not leave. They asked for wine and meat at the Qian family, sat down to eat, and asked for money while eating. When there was not enough food and drink, everyone went to the kitchen to take it themselves. They made even more noise when they drank, pretending to go crazy after getting drunk. The adopted son had no way to deal with them and still hid upstairs in the back, afraid to come downstairs. Liu Rushi said bitterly, "These people are really hateful. They clearly know that no one will stand up for the minister after his death and are just waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. If they really want money, why would they do this? The adopted son said, "He Si, the White Flower Snake, is a famous local ruffian here. People didn't pay attention to him before. Since the Qing soldiers came south, he has joined forces with a group of hooligans, shaved his head first, got to know a few Banner soldiers, and relied on their power to be tyrannical in this county, bullying good people and extorting money from others. His power is growing day by day. He seems to be among the gentry. They used him to intimidate our family in this debt collection matter, and he also wanted to take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, so others left, but he still refuses to leave. How do we deal with him?"</p>

<p>Sayings on Self-Cultivation (18)</p>
<p>A boat sailing in the sea, the wind is strong and the waves are high, the danger is indeed dangerous, but it is not necessarily bad; unfortunately, being seized by a monster in the sea, with a bloody storm and fierce wind, the evil is indeed evil, but it is not necessarily desperate; unfortunately, if the change occurs within the elbow and armpit, and those in the same boat become enemies, then there is truly no hope!</p>
<h3>The Unrealism of Scenery: Film Studios Increasingly Turn to On-Location Filming; "Desire" Achieves Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>— Sima Hua</p>
<p>The major film companies in Hollywood all possess vast and fully equipped studios. When filming, no matter where in the world the story's background is drawn from, the results are always very satisfactory. This is naturally due to the exquisite scenery and appropriate research, but strong capital is the source of all power.</p>
<p>At that time, actors worked in the studios during the day, playing Arabian sheikhs, Alaskan trappers, red-coated Mounties, Western rogues, or cowboys, and in the evening, they could still go home to dine at their own tables and sleep soundly in their own beds. The film company authorities got what they needed, creating realistic films, and the actors also felt convenient.</p>
<p>Today, the above situation has changed considerably, because the hope for achievement in filmmaking has increased, and the scenery in the studios is no longer considered realistic enough, so they are increasingly turning to on-location shooting. Actors are taken to remote places, and they can no longer have the enjoyments of the past, but spend the night in tents, huts, or farmhouses. Here are many examples:</p>
<p>The RKO Pictures blockbuster "Desire," starring Charles Laughton and Carole Lombard, which was recently released, was led by director Garson Kanin, along with other actors, to Napa in the northern part of the state, thousands of miles away, to shoot exterior scenes of vineyards. They stayed in farmhouses and suffered a lot. The plot of "Desire" is a story of life and love that takes place in a vineyard in that area. Although there are also vineyards in Southern California, they are not the Napa vineyards needed in the plot!</p>
<p>MGM's blockbuster "Northwest Passage" was filmed in the mountainous countryside of Idaho in the West, because it is full of green forests, rushing rivers, and bottomless swamps—fully representing the landscape of the Saint Lawrence River region in the time of the ranger Rogers, although this era has become a thing of the past due to the progress of civilization. Spencer Tracy and his partners, when filming this film, were like an army camping in the wild.</p>
<p>Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea went to Montalvo Beach to film "Primrose Path." Now Paramount is preparing to go to Virginia in the East to film a film named "Virginia," just as Columbia went to Arizona to film a film named "Arizona." At the same time, the new Western star, Tim Holt, will star in two films in a row, and will film on location in the countryside of Utah in the West.</p>
<p>Hollywood used to film locally with scenery as the background, and although there were many blockbusters, they were not satisfied, and turned to more expensive on-location filming, entirely for the sake of seeking greater realism in the background. This great sacrifice for art—or, one might say, for business acumen—is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>(The picture shows the two protagonists of "The Charge of the Light Brigade": Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland)</p>
<h3>Professor Shepherd Opens a Photography Studio</h3>
<p>Professor Shepherd, a photographer, is an Austrian who was annexed into Germany not long ago. He has a very high level of attainment in photography. In the European art world, everyone speaks highly of Shepherd. In the past, Russian Emperor Nicholas, Austrian Emperor Joseph, and British Emperor Edward VII all specially requested Shepherd to take photographs for them. His works have been displayed at international exhibitions in Paris and London, and have been unanimously praised by public opinion. His "carbon portraits" can emphasize the characteristics of the photographed subjects, making them look radiant and dynamic, and they are long-lasting. In addition, natural color photography and oil rendering are Shepherd's specialties. Shepherd has been in Shanghai for more than a year, and now has a photography studio at 267 Jiangxi Road. Those who like to have their pictures taken should not miss this opportunity.</p>
