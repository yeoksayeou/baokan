<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c7">美日會開戰嗎？ <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>美日兩國究竟會開戰嗎？這是人人懸在心頭，擺在眼前，爭求解答的疑問。上海數百萬居民與此問題有直接的密切利害關係，環居太平洋沿岸的數十國族，十餘萬萬人類，與此問題亦莫不有直接關係，一如上海。抑何止此，戰不戰的影響并及於歐洲非洲，乃係有關整個世界，有關今後歷史的嚴重問題。但在目前，若非隨便談談，不負責任的說不戰，說必戰；否則，誰也不能解答。或說危機即在今後十星期之內，或說危機即在本年二三月間；如此說法，究是情報的透露，還是理想的推測，總之，皆非謂事在必然，乃僅謂有其可能；可能的發展之結果，依然是或然或不然。</p>
<p>美日交戰影響所及的利害如何，不戰的利害如何？應該怎樣準備，怎樣應付？宜爲人人置之於鄭重而縝密的考慮之中。若乃研討其戰或不戰，則應摒除了患得患失的利害觀念於考慮之外，而純粹作客觀的觀察。</p>
<p>觀察美日關係，自兩國根本言之，彼此的政策實屬勢不兩立，且向同一方面發展，故在政治上外交上經濟上乃至軍備競爭上，可謂早已在交戰之中。倘若肯定其爲旣相交戰而言之，則日本不但以破壞九國公的而得視之爲早已向美國採取攻勢；且若與德義兩國締結盟約，自食其維持法屬越南現狀的宣言而逼訂日越協定，昌言不辭與英美發生衝突而悍然南進，構煽於越泰之間，於中取利，而實行其南進，强求荷屬東印度列入彼所謂東亞共榮圈，及其朝野對美所作肆無忌憚的議論，凡此種種，尤得視之爲繼續不斷的向美國採取攻勢。從這些攻勢而論，實已播種了美日砲火交加的種子。換一方面言之，美國早已有應付日本攻勢的事實，且有宣戰的理由，但並未宣戰。</p>
<p>從現實的狀况，以迄軍事行動，砲火交加而爆發戰爭，其間尚有距離。即此距離，極可能的使戰爭不致實現。蓋檢討採取攻勢的日本：其一，對華侵略的軍事行動雖渴望結束而騎虎難下，無法結束，倘若再與美國作戰，則不問力量如何，却先自陷於兩面受敵的不利地位，這是兵家大忌。其二，日本國力枯竭，不惟準備金的蕩然無存爲世界周知之事實，即以食米而論，平民每日每人限食二合，萬萬不足充饑；士兵當然不致不飽，然其給養亦已遠遜於規定的標準；如此捉襟見肘，行將不能繼續維持對華侵略，更何能從事於對美作戰。其三，日本一般的生活資源，依存於海外；一朝作戰，必受封鎖；自在經濟上毫無辦法之日而對美作戰，無殊自殺。其四，政治上對於原來政制帶有革命性的大政協贊，可謂至今一無成就。而其內在矛盾的存在更暴露無餘；是在政治尚未安定之際，何能動員全力，赴戰海外。其五，日本在中國的軍事佔領區域內厲行壓榨剝削，然有裨彼國庫者究有幾何，依然是絕大疑問；對於法屬越南，亦肥沃在握，然目前亦無實益可言；蓋正常的經營，正常的利潤，皆是今日所談不到；然則遽與美國作戰，實無新資源可資憑藉。其六，日本對蘇聯力求妥協，却主今一無成就；遑論一日不能妥協即一日不能將昆連蘇聯方面的軍備及一切力量移作他用，且有更嚴重的後顧之憂；即使妥協，保障又安在？其七，日本陸軍在中國的銷蝕，自不必論；其海軍空軍的質量，皆屬遠不如美國，雖曰地利上戰略上或可弭補一部份的先天弱點，而勝敗的決定又不盡繫於質量，然日本對美作戰之絕對沒有制勝的把握，則雖日人亦所不諱；沒有把握，便是冒險，忠貞謀國者必不願將國運作冒險的嘗試。其八，日本對國際的威脅行動，以及恐嚇外交，實以所擁海軍爲其唯一後盾；質言之，日本的海軍是其孤注，有其孤注則猶有可圖，喪其孤注則束手待斃；然則日本豈宜向美國作孤注之一擲？綜此八大端，殊未信日本敢自軍事上對美進攻，亦未信美日竟至交戰。</p>
<p>然而日本正因對華失利而進退失據，正因百無一可而倒行逆施，一切未可用正常的理論來推想，則又安知不因「死裏求生」的一念蠢動呢？制止它的蠢動，惟有中國早獲國際有效的援助，早作有效的反攻。</p>

<p>衝入會塲　縱火焚燒</p>
<p>至跑馬廳路、直衝跑馬廳竹籬、致一部份竹籬塌倒、時車燈已熄、值崗跑馬廳之俄捕一名圖阻此車、車燈突然光芒强烈、俄捕目爲之眩、兩日人駕車至蘆蓆棚旁停下、將一瓶中液體澆向蘆蓆小舍一所、遂告起火、但被俄捕一名用雙手與大衣撲熄、</p>

<p>大陸報載稱華盛頓傳來之消息稱、美國國務院、現正考慮由高勘繼詹遜而爲駐華大使、此間人士、接獲此項消息後、其所起之反響、並不一致、高期在上海及中國各地、頗多友好、彼等聞悉此前任駐滬總領事將被選爲美國外交界最重要之職務、當然欣喜異常、高斯係有訓練之外交家、對於中國事務、經騐豐富、且熟悉中國內情、美國派其出任駐華大使、必能成爲良好之使節、此點無用懷疑、</p>
<p>在任期內　貢獻甚多</p>
<p>然另一方面、凡深知詹遜大使之爲人、及曾與其同事者、對所傳渠將退出中國舞台一消息、莫不深表遺憾、詹氏來華時、最初任駐華公使之職、後陞遷爲大使、在渠任駐華使節之若干年中、其所作爲、確定譽爲美國外交傳統上最有價值之一事、我人雖不敢於此時　詹遜之名、與美國外交史最負盛名之外交家、諸如佛蘭克令等相比擬、然詹遜已將中國吸入其血液之中、經愉快之化學作用後、渠不唯愛慕其祖國、且愛慕其所駐在之姊妹國家、使過去十年中、詹遜與其所依戀之中國河山、同成爲中國景色中之一部、</p>
<p>中美關係　益見密切</p>
<p>在過去三十年中、國際外交局勢、烏烟瘴氣、混亂不堪、然中美邦交、始終融洽無間、中美人士皆深爲快慰、若干人士認兩國邦交之良好為當然之事、然我人則以為此事係詹遜高斯及其他車越之外交家優良工作之結果、前三年之遠東局勢、使中美邦交達空前之密切、促進華盛頓與重慶間合作及敎睦之最大功臣、無疑即爲詹遜、詹氏爲中國局勢之報吿員、國各院之顧問及輔弼者、同時又担任通訊員之職、以華盛頓官方之態度、報告中國政府、詹氏所作之工作、精巧而整潔、外交家中能作此種優良之工作者、殊不多覯、我人雅不願於此時此地、援用陳話俗套、高唱「不可一日無詹遜」、我人亦不願曉曉不休、引用「勿中流而易馬」之俗語、然「不可一日無此君」及「勿中流而易馬」用以形容詹遜、非常恰當、</p>
<p>繼續供職　有其必要</p>
<p>詹遜在重慶已有久長之歷史、對於中國事務瞭如指掌、因之、在此中國局勢危急之秋將其調赴他處、似非計之所得、以高斯繼仟詹遜、自中美兩國視之深厚得人、然在外交舞台上、人的因素、異常重要、今詹遜在華、旣費數十年之時間與此間人士交接、此點在外交上殊爲重要、因之繼詹遜而爲駐華大使之人、下車之始、欲蕭規曹隨、必感困難、指派何人爲駐外大使、雖非平民份內之事、然促進中美之福利及使兩國之友誼賡續、兩國平民無疑責無旁貸、我人以爲爲中美兩國及兩國人民之利益計、華盛頓若能允詹遜繼續任中國大使、實爲一非常明顯之舉、</p>

<p>其實這不是我的家，是二妹的。我動身到外國去的時候，把這四個無母的孩子寄託在這裹。現在一進門正見最小的在天井里玩積木。她怕生地跑，走了。三個大的圍着桌唸古文，看見我也都陌生地跑開了，好像都不認得我（其實是認得的）。我看見最大的梅，小老鼠似地溜進廂房，輕聲的說：」二姑，爸回來了呢！但其餘三個確都木鷄似地在那兒。</p>
<p>二姑即刻就出來了。她看見我正捉住小瓏，要她叫我，並且吻她；小瓏分明是不怎樣熟悉她的爸的，被我堅硬的鬚刺得哭了。</p>
<p>『小瓏！』像雷樣的吼，我急忙尋找聲音的來源，原來是二妹。她板緊了臉爸爸呀！不許哭，我要打…』小瓏立刻停了哭。是被嚇停呢！的確，連我也給嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>可是二姑却若無其事，把伸出來將要打到孩子身上去的一隻手，換了方式，把孩子牽到我面前，柔聲的說：『小瓏眞乖，乖極嘍！來，叫爸爸…」但孩子到底還生，沒有叫只把兩隻珠子似的小眼，畏怯地看了我一兩下。這使得二姑又吼起來了，：</p>
<p>叫呀！你叫，不叫我就—」撫摸孩子的手又拾起來了。</p>
<p>『爸—爸！』孩子畏怯地叫了兩聲。我看見她小小的眼眶裏充滿了淚水，打量了一下二姑的的板着的臉，緊緊地把眼睛閉上，沒有讓眼淚流出來。</p>
<p>二姑餘怒未消，掉過臉去提起那其餘三個因驚奇而呆住了的孩子。『念書去』看什麼？』三個孩子就老鼠似地爬回桌邊，心不在焉哼了起來，眼睛都不時在我身上溜一下。</p>
<p>孩子們認淸了爸爸了，纏着我要聽故事。</p>
<p>我給他們講了一個馬漢姆敎授的故事。</p>
<p>「這些是眞的嗎？」</p>
<p>「羅特眞可憐，她不能再上學了！」</p>
<p>「猶太人多可憐的！」</p>
<p>孩子們天眞地問。在他們純潔的心靈上，決想不到世上會有這殘酷的事。最大的梅却說：</p>
<p>「是發生在德國的嗎？」看見我點了點頭，她又驚奇問：「可是二姑說德國的政治是最好的呀！不對嗎？爸？」</p>
<p>我給問得愕住了！這是我的二妹說的話嗎？我獨自在想。</p>
<p>下午我帶孩子們到他們外婆家去，我奇怪，他們好像都是活潑了。</p>
<p>三姨新買了一架鋼琴，孩子們就蒼蠅見血似地湧了過去：</p>
<p>「鋼琴，鋼琴…」於是八隻小手就可可鼕鼕地在琴鍵上亂撳起來，使得外婆也笑了。</p>
<p>「鋼琴沒有見過嗎？」我明明記得二妹房里，也有一架鋼琴，「怎麼這樣大驚小怪呢？」</p>
<p>孩子們沒有回答，是完全給鋼琴引住了。</p>
<p>「二姑不是也有鋼琴嗎？」我重覆了一遍。</p>
<p>「二姑的琴？」小玲掉轉身來向我做了個頑皮的鬼臉，表示不可能。</p>
<p>其餘的也都跟着掉轉身子，悄悄地說：「那是不准我們彈的啊！」於是又都回到琴上去了。</p>
<p>我回味我到家後所見的一</p>
<p>討厭的東西　陳琪作切，隨地又想起早上梅的問話，我的心冷了。</p>
<p>『啊！可憐的孩子，你們也跟羅特一樣可憐，你們也是在法西斯統治之下啊！（却酬）</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「做戲子沒有什麼可恥，可恥的惟有給人家稱做淫伶的人，」紹文的沉着而有力的聲音，彷彿越來越響了。</p>
<p>及至王大奶奶把那鑽戒遞到秋海棠的胸前時，一種天神似的光彩，已在這個唱戲的靑年人的臉上透出來了。</p>
<p>挺直了身子，掃盡向來所有的那種忸怩溫存的態度，看定了王少奶奶的一雙水汪汪的眼睛。</p>
<p>「太太，恕我不向你請敎你的尊姓了，因爲我要趕快忘記今天的這一會事，同時也希望你趕快把它忘記掉！今天的事，乾脆的說一句話，就是你要用你的錢，來買我道一個人！可是，對不起得很！這個交易不會成功了！因爲我不想出賣自己，並且我也知道自己只是個唱戲的，除掉在臺上能够扮女人，唱小嗓子以外，什麼也不值一個大錢！所以我不但不願賣給你，而且還勸你不耍買！假使你想買我的目的是爲了要我快樂的話，那末我可以告訴你，是不會使你快樂的，而且還會使你把原有的快樂一起斷送掉！湊你現在還保有你自己的快樂的時候，讓我們把這筆交易根本勾銷了吧！」</p>
<p>這一番鐵錚錚的議論，倒眞是做了五六年內掌櫃，享盡了一切繁華的王少奶奶所夢想不到的。一股莫明其妙的力量，從秋海棠那兩顆平時很柔和的眼睛裏射出來，使她覺得冰冷，不由不怔怔地呆住了。</p>
<p>「我答應你永遠把今天的事忘記掉！你還是一個淸白的人！」</p>
<p>秋海棠大踏步跨出了餐室去，昂着頭，像一個才從敎堂裏出來的牧師一樣。　（二一）</p>

<h3 id="c76">米老闆的新年 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 李大光</p>
<p>米老闆的年紀至少也有五十多了。</p>
<p>每天早晨，時鐘敲過九下，他一陣咳嗽聲打破了他家寂靜的空氣。一個十七八歲的少女——他的小老婆——扶着他起來，洗面，嗽口。</p>
<p>半個鐘頭以後，他倚在榻上「吞雲吐霧」，然後用了早點，坐上包車到洋行裏去。</p>
<p>大老婆是一個父胖又大，脾氣爆燥的老闆娘。每逢老頭兒走了，她才伸起肥手，打了兩個呵欠，用那破竹管的聲音叫娘姨打洗面水，然後狼吞虎嚥地飽用早點。</p>
<p>因爲她是主婦，所以無時不聽見她在「駡三門」，除非她像猪一樣的睡去了。</p>
<p>包車送過老闆，又得讓老闆娘坐着去買小菜，房間裏留下娘姨掃地，揩棹椅，小老婆幫着整理被褥。</p>
<p>下午，老闆娘看紹興戲去了，老爺仍在洋行裏，娘姨在洗衣服；小老婆便開始作針　向同屋的人訴她的苦衷了。</p>
<p>她是一個貧苦的孤兒，生活壓迫她的母親把他賣給這米行的老闆——我們的二房東。</p>
<p>她是三年前就久了他家的，那時她還只有十五歲，便開始遭受着棍鞭辱駡的生活了。</p>
<p>她常背地抽咽，他常神經錯亂，把娘姨當作老闆娘，跽下來向她求僥。</p>
<p>三年前，那時的時局非常緊張逃走的人很多，這位老闆用極賤的價錢頂下了這一幢房子，開始一間五十，二間一百的出租，後來漸漸的十元二十元的加上去，直到現在，除他住的房子不用出錢以外，還可以賺幾倍錢。</p>
<p>老闆的生意，非常順手，每天晚上，他吃了晚飯，吸飽了鴉片，便興高采烈的嚷着：</p>
<p>「……西貢米……漲了四十元……哈哈……我六千袋大米……你算算看……哈哈！」</p>
<p>春節裏，老闆睡在家裏，他得意的神氣，難以形容，每天大吃大喝的開心着。鼻孔裏時時哼着京腔。賞娘姨十元……這個壓歲錢，那個賞錢……忙得不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>初一那天，大家向他道喜的時候，他和像發瘋一般，向來的勢利的模樣，瞧不起人的眼光都更換了。他和老闆娘扭作一團，口中不住的嚷着「……潑婦……爛貨……老子今朝要那能便那能……再娶一個關你啥體……阿三！來打伊……。」</p>
<p>原來米老闆又買了一個小女孩了。</p>
<p>他們一直鬧着，結果從前的小老婆自殺了，新買來的小女孩讓老闆娘逼着服了毒，老頭兒本身也哭哭啼啼，如在如痴的呆了。救護車，巡捕，探目，記者，代替了賀年客，在他家忙碌着。</p>

<h3 id="c78">上海書塲新陣容 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 聿脩</p>
<p>上海書塲例必在廢曆新年着手改組，對於檔數，座價，人事方面，重新調整；尤其在羅致響檔，增加號召力量，以便利用堅强陣容，簇新姿態，出與其他同業相競賽。</p>
<p>但是上海書塲，一向在所謂「上海響檔」的包辦下面，像走馬燈一樣的轉來轉去，始終換不出一些新鮮的味道；今年自然也很難例外，還是跳不出這個換湯不換藥的老調</p>
<p>不過有一椿更爲明顯的事實，就是書塲有限，饗檔過剩的現象，似乎今年尤加來得厲害。這只要看以蔣朱，沈薛這樣第一流的大響檔，竟找不到一席地；吐血四官的許繼祥也只有匯泉樓一塲，可想而知。</p>
<p>以現狀而論，自然是東方的實力最爲雄厚。描王夏荷生，陰間秀才周玉泉而外，還有陳魏檔的珠塔。陳雪舫是十五年前薛筱卿的老搭檔，以歌喉嘹亮，說白淸爽見長，而魏含央則家學淵博（鈺卿之子，現唱珠塔者，十九出魏氏門下），還依稀保存着幾分馬調的氣味；所以白沈薛拆檔之後，上海珠塔一書，快成爲他們的家天下了。可惜評話韓鐘二檔，較有遜色。</p>
<p>次之是富春。飛機英烈的張鴻聲，在這裏一復再復，居　還照樣拉得牢人，他的聲勢，逐漸有壓倒許繼祥同他老師蔣一飛的樣子，眞合得上一句是「後生可畏」了。此外楊仁林同在雲峰，一個彈唱風雅，一個書路淸脫，都擅一技之長，而各有相當號召的力量。其餘如湖園，雅廬，南園，也無非就是這幾個人在那裏跳來跳去，不再贅述。</p>
<p>果報録一書，自王綬卿歿後，耍算到他的老弟綬章了。雖說他的唱法太舊了一點，可是說噱彈唱，無一不佳，尤其一口動聽的兪調，實非時下後生小子，所能望其項背，所以說者甚至推謂其藝出乃兄之上。現來上海，雖只侷促於無人注意之風鳴臺，但老聽客仍不憚路遠，趨之若騖，盛况不减</p>
<p>最後，大中華的揚州書，日塲康又華已剪，換上莫天鴻等四檔大小書，並以莫天鴻的大套琵琶來號召，這是光裕社今年開闢的新地盤；但實力太差，究不足同附近的東方互做敵檔。夜塲王少堂的水滸，仍舊蟬聯下去，接做年檔，據說營業還着實不壞。</p>
<p>南京書塲普餘社的女說書，今年也沒有新人加入，只把原來幾檔重新調整一下罷了。但謝樂天已逐漸失去領袖地位，降而退唱開鑼戲的頭檔，三徐檔　風頭大健，後來居上，已殿後「送客」矣。</p>
<h3 id="c79">黃金觀劇記 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>農歷新正初五，黃金新角王金瑯貼演惡虎村，李玉茹演拱盤山，一係楊派短打武劇，由名敎師丁永利親授；一則爲北平戲校占行敎師吳富琴所傳，並摹擬艷秋，慧生之姿態表情，乃刀馬旦之有骨子戲也。當民國廿三年余旅居舊京時，王生金璐已常演壓軸，與去歲出演更新之傳德威，稱爲戲校武生行之一時瑜亮；惟二人所不同者，即傳習尚派，多貼長靠劇，王搜短打戲，以小樓之唱，作，唸，打，爲法耳。至於金璐之身段，扮相，可稱邊式漂亮，儼然小振庭當年。出科後復得老伶工丁永利之盡心指授，故技藝益較前猛進，嗓音在倒嗆後（年才廿一歲）能有此成績，亦頗不易。總觀「惡虎村」全劇，武功身段均有足觀，惟與天鵰，天虬，蓋口時，似嫌稍快，倘能再有幾載工夫，則火候一到，自覺沉着有力，無過與不及之弊矣。金璐其勉旃！玉茹吃調雖不高，但唱來婉轉動聽，運用自如，似深得慧生之三昧者也。</p>
<h3 id="c80">寫在大雷雨公演之前 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 葉素</p>
<p>「大雷雨」在中國的話劇舞台上已經不是陌生的戲劇，但這次經芳信先生把原作重新翻譯，並在親自的導演之下；由素著聲譽的中靑劇社以極鄭重的態度搬登脚光，實已改變了一個完全不同的嶄新的姿態。</p>
<p>這種姿態的改變，我以爲正說明了中國的話劇運動，在艱苦的成長道路中，一個飛躍的進展。首先他使中國的話劇觀衆對這個不朽的世界名著有一種新的瞭解，洗刷過去單把它當作一個無望的命運悲劇的不正確的認識，更進一步接觸到它的社會悲劇的鬥爭的面目。導演者特別加强庫力金這一個空想的性格，更明晰的映照出被舊時代所壓抑的向自由的心的跳動。在這兒，使我們更眞實的感覺，伏邇迦河上天空里的疾雷暴雨的轟隆，並不僅僅如技巧主義者所運用的單爲了加强戲劇的緊張的氣氛，而是舊社會的叛逆者在突圍中所呼出來的厮煞的叫吼，和這社會基礎開始崩潰起來的聲嚮。</p>
<p>在我們的四周也正吹打猛烈的雷雨—叛逆者的厮煞的叫吼和舊社會的崩壞的聲音，而且我們的提闊意和卡彭諾芙太太們有着更大的殘酷和頑固，他們爲着守護這座倒壞着的廢墟，挽回自己垂危的命運，正不惜搬運更多的舊傳統的骸骨，不惜葬送整個的民族，來截殺新生的生命。然而我們的藝術家有多大勇氣來正視這血淋淋的現實，有多大的藝術形象傳達出這樣的時代的聲音的呢？</p>
<p>在劇烈的民族鬥爭過程中，話劇運動顯現了意外的勃興，到達建立職業劇塲的階段，然而傳統的壓抑的重量和工作者的基礎的薄弱，使這種勃興不免顯露了虛胖的樣子，更以職業化的條件，表現了迎合流俗的危險的傾向。在這樣的時候，勇敢大胆的向最大抵抗綫突進，嘗試作難劇的運動，從世界大藝衛作品中去尋找觀摩學習的機會，是有重大的意義的。在這意義中介紹「大雷雨」，是非常適當的時會。這個戲劇有着充沛的詩情，橫溢着詩的優雅和詩的奔放，它的社會敎訓的意義，完全融和詩的情調之中。從它的典範可以告訴我們藝術創造者只有把自己的對象完全溶化於血肉生命中的時候，他才發抒這種完整的詩情，而且只有這種詩的生命，才是藝術的生命。這對於充滿着抽象概念，充滿着生硬，割裂，殘缺形象的中國話劇舞台，不是一個很强烈的映照麼？從這映照中，我們應該有所警惕！</p>

<p>Chongqing - Military News: (1) Regarding the war in southern Henan, the achievements of the Chinese army in completing its mission are summarized as follows: In the Xianghe Pass and Kundiandian area, fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese armies lasted for five days and nights. The Chinese army annihilated over 9,000 Japanese soldiers, seizing over a hundred light and heavy machine guns, over 1,200 rifles, over 300 war horses, and other spoils of war, which are still being inventoried. A Japanese force attempting to invade Fangcheng from Bao’an Post to the west was routed by the Chinese army. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Fangcheng, Bao’an Post, and other places, leaving behind over 2,000 Japanese corpses. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated southeast. The Chinese army quickly recaptured strongholds such as Fangcheng, Bao’an Post, Dushuzhen, and Zhaofugang. On the evening of the 2nd, the Japanese forces entering the Beishangfeng River area of Wuyang City were attacked by the Chinese army, resulting in the annihilation of several hundred Japanese soldiers.

<h3 id="e5">The United States Maintains a Taciturn Attitude Towards the Thai-Vietnamese Peace Negotiations; Observers Believe That It Will Adopt a "Moral Stance" and Oppose Japanese Military Privileges in Vietnam <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Washington - The State Department remained silent yesterday regarding the role played by Japan in the Vietnamese-Thai peace negotiations. However, the best-informed observers believe that the United States will adopt a "moral stance" and oppose Japan's acquisition of new military privileges in Vietnam. Observers believe that the United States may not quickly initiate major steps against Japan, as the United States is currently focused on assisting Great Britain. It is generally believed that the government will currently avoid any action that would upset the balance of public opinion, as general opinion is focused on accelerating the production of aid to Britain. Officials stated yesterday that they had not received concrete evidence of external reports that Japan had inserted six secret clauses into the Thai-Vietnamese armistice agreement. Observers believe that these clauses are highly probable because their function is consistent with Japan's southward policy. Officials also stated that it is generally believed that the Vichy government is not paying excessive attention to the Thai-Vietnamese peace negotiations because the Vichy government is powerless to reject Japanese demands, regardless of what happens. Well-informed circles here predict that the most tense period in South Asia is about to arrive, and conflicts may occur at any time. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy - French officials announced last night that the Thai-Vietnamese armistice agreement has now been signed. The friendship between Thailand and Vietnam will soon return to normal.

Various issues between Thailand and Vietnam will be discussed by a joint committee composed of France, Thailand, and Japan. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Thai-Vietnamese Truce Agreement Concluded; Eastern Newspaper Self-Satisfied</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Yomiuri Shimbun commented on the conclusion of the Thai-Vietnamese armistice agreement, extending its congratulations to both countries and pointing out the fairness and impartiality of the judgment that both armies should withdraw ten kilometers. It is claimed that if the Thai-Vietnamese representatives come to Tokyo to participate in the peace conference, embracing this spirit of mutual concession, the conference can be expected to conclude in a short period of time. For the benefit of all peoples within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, this kind of mutual concession is absolutely necessary. If the laws of nature and historical relationships are disregarded, then no dispute of any nature can be resolved. It is hoped that Thailand and Vietnam will not covet small immediate gains and engage in disputes, but instead embrace a broad vision for the future prosperity of East Asia, in order to seek a fundamental solution.

<p>Bangkok - A Thai communiqué stated yesterday that at the time of the armistice negotiations in Saigon, the Japanese government had advised the Thai side that it considered it necessary to send a destroyer to anchor in Bangkok. The purpose of this measure was to facilitate communication between the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok and the Japanese ships docked outside Saigon and communication between Bangkok and the Japanese government. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy - The US Ambassador to France, Leahy, has recently discussed with the French Foreign Minister, Flandin, the two issues of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and Japan's demands in Vietnam. It is reported that Flandin has reported the details of the Saigon talks at the time of the signing of the Thai-Vietnamese armistice agreement to Leahy. It is also reported that Leahy inquired of Flandin about the news that Japan was attempting to expand its naval and air bases in Vietnam. Official sources here have made no statement regarding the alleged Japanese demand to use Cam Ranh Bay. Cam Ranh Bay is an important large bay in the South China Sea near Saigon and one of the largest naval bases in the Far East. Cam Ranh Bay is far south of Hanoi. The French had granted Japan considerable limited maritime, land, and air privileges last August. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Thai-Vietnamese Border Troops Have Not Complied With the Agreement to Withdraw</p>
<p>Bangkok - The Thai Supreme Command here announced last night that the fighting in the Aranyaprathet area had broken out again, and the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the Vietnamese-Thai dispute seemed to be fading. The Thai government recently announced that the four Japanese destroyers anchored in the Chao Phraya River were dispatched from Japan four days ago "so that news during the peace negotiations could be transmitted from Bangkok to Saigon and Tokyo." The Supreme Command stated that six French military patrols passed through the area recently occupied by Thai troops in the Combatt (phonetic) area yesterday. Thai troops immediately surrounded the French troops, capturing four, wounding one, and one escaping. It is reported that a minor conflict occurred at the time. Subsequently, a French detachment attacked the Combatt village, but was repulsed by Thai troops. It is reported that French troops attacked the area again this morning. The communiqué indicated that neither side's troops had withdrawn ten miles from the border, as stipulated in the agreement signed in Saigon last week. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bangkok - A Thai headquarters communiqué declared that yesterday, when the Thai delegation was preparing to depart from Bangkok to attend the Tokyo peace conference, the French violated the armistice agreement on the Thai-Vietnamese border. Three clashes occurred in the Sisophon area on the eastern front. Six French reconnaissance troops entered the neutral zone, one died, one escaped, and the remaining four were arrested. An hour later, a French regiment and two tanks attempted to invade the area but were repulsed. The French made a third attempt, which was also unsuccessful. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Special Arrangements Will Be Made for the Location of Troops on Both Sides</p>
<p>Hanoi - An official communiqué recently stated that the armistice agreement signed by France and Thailand on the 31st of last month stipulated that troops on both sides should withdraw ten kilometers from the front line. This measure only applies to the Cambodian region. In most parts of Laos Province, troops on both sides should be stationed on opposite banks of the Mekong River boundary river. In addition, Upper Laos Province and Bassac are both located on the right bank of the Mekong River. Therefore, special arrangements have been made regarding the location of troops on both sides.

<p>Thai-Vietnamese Representatives to Japan Expected to Depart Tomorrow</p>
<p>Bangkok - According to Japanese sources, the Thai delegation led by Prince Phraiwan, Advisor to the Thai Foreign Minister, flew back here from Saigon yesterday afternoon after completing its mission to attend the Vietnamese armistice conference. The Thai delegation to the Tokyo peace conference is expected to depart for Japan on February 5. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Chinese Army is Prepared Should Japan Attack Yunnan from Vietnam</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Ta Kung Pao in Kunming reported today that Yunnan Provincial Chairman Long Yun declared yesterday, "If the Japanese army attacks Yunnan from French Indochina, then the Chinese army in Yunnan Province is prepared. Japan's purpose in mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute is to consolidate the Japanese army's position in Vietnam, especially in Tokyo. Japan is determined to make France listen to its commands. But before Japan can consolidate its position in Vietnam, Japan cannot use that place as a starting point for attacking other places. Attacking Yunnan Province is also impossible. If the Japanese army does attack Yunnan Province, we are prepared to prevent them from crossing the border." (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This morning's Ta Kung Pao carried a report that a recent visit to Yunnan Chairman General Long Yun stated that if the Japanese army attempts to attack Yunnan, Yunnan Province will do its utmost to resist. Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute aims to expand its power in Vietnam and completely control the Tokyo area. Rumors that Japan is still hesitant to advance south remain to be verified. Japan may attempt to attack Yunnan Province, but according to experts, Japan will not do so until its position in Vietnam is consolidated because the Japanese army must use Vietnam as the general base for attacking Yunnan. Yunnan Province is mountainous and has a rugged terrain. If the Japanese army attacks Yunnan, it must fight away from highways and railways and must rely on livestock or labor to transport supplies and provisions. This season is the most suitable time to attack Yunnan. After this, the climate will worsen, and the rainy season will begin. At that time, it will be extremely difficult to conduct large-scale battles. It is difficult to predict whether the Japanese army will attack Yunnan before or after the rainy season. As long as the Japanese do not give up their ambition to conquer China, we must be fully prepared to deal with all contingencies. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japan Determined to Implement Southern Advance Policy <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun commented today, criticizing Hoshino, Director-General of the Planning Board and Minister without Portfolio, for his remarks in the House of Representatives implying that the South Seas region is Japan's "lifeline," saying that it is clear that Japan will proceed according to its established policy, regardless of what attitude the Dutch East Indies adopts towards Japan's request for cooperation in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper suspected that the Dutch government, which remains in London and expressed its opposition to the incorporation of the Netherlands into the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere to Japan on Friday, has Britain and the United States behind it. Therefore, it believes that the Dutch government's expression of dissent is a bold manifestation of the United States challenging Japan. The newspaper concluded that no matter how the United States obstructs, Japan will still be guided by its absolute right to survival and advance south. Therefore, the future attitude of the United States may lead to a serious situation. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Will the United States and Japan Go to War? <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Will the United States and Japan go to war? This is a question that everyone has on their minds, in front of their eyes, and is trying to answer. Millions of residents in Shanghai have a direct and close interest in this issue. Tens of thousands of people from dozens of countries and ethnic groups living around the Pacific coast also have a direct relationship with this issue, just like Shanghai. But that's not all. The impact of war or no war extends to Europe and Africa, which is a serious issue related to the entire world and the future of history. But at the moment, unless you're just chatting casually, irresponsibly saying there won't be a war or there definitely will be a war, no one can answer. Some say the crisis is within the next ten weeks, others say the crisis is in February or March of this year. Ultimately, whether these statements are the revelation of intelligence or the speculation of ideals, they are not to say that things are inevitable, but only to say that there is a possibility. The result of possible developments is still either probable or improbable.</p>
<p>What are the benefits and drawbacks of the United States and Japan going to war? What are the benefits and drawbacks of not going to war? Everyone should give this serious and careful consideration. When discussing whether or not there will be a war, the concept of gains and losses should be removed from consideration, and a purely objective observation should be made.</p>
<p>Observing the relationship between the United States and Japan, from the fundamental point of view of the two countries, their policies are actually incompatible and developing in the same direction. Therefore, in politics, diplomacy, economics, and even the arms race, they can be said to be already at war. If it is affirmed that they are already at war, then Japan has not only destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty and can be regarded as having already taken an offensive against the United States, but also concluded an alliance with Germany and Italy, broken its promise to maintain the status quo of French Indochina, forced the signing of the Japanese-Vietnamese agreement, brazenly advanced south, stirring up trouble between Vietnam and Thailand, and profiting from it, and implemented its southward advance, strongly demanded that the Dutch East Indies be included in its so-called East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and its words and deeds towards the United States have been unscrupulous. All of this can be regarded as a continuous offensive against the United States. From these offensives, the seeds of armed conflict between the United States and Japan have been sown. On the other hand, the United States already has the facts to deal with Japan's offensive and has reasons to declare war, but it has not declared war.</p>
<p>From the current situation to military action, there is still a distance between armed conflict and the outbreak of war. It is this distance that makes it very possible that war will not be realized. Examining Japan, which has taken the offensive: First, its military actions of aggression against China, although eager to end, are difficult to get off of. If it goes to war with the United States again, regardless of its strength, it will first fall into the unfavorable position of being attacked on two fronts, which is a major taboo for strategists. Second, Japan's national strength is exhausted. Not only is the exhaustion of its gold reserves a well-known fact in the world, but even in terms of rice, civilians are limited to two gō per person per day, which is far from enough to fill their stomachs. Soldiers are certainly not underfed, but their supplies are also far below the prescribed standards. In this way, it will be unable to continue its aggression against China, let alone engage in war with the United States. Third, Japan's general living resources depend on overseas countries. Once war breaks out, it will be blockaded. Going to war with the United States on a day when there is no way to be economically self-sufficient is tantamount to suicide. Fourth, politically, the Grand Political Association, which has a revolutionary nature for the original political system, can be said to have achieved nothing so far. And the existence of its internal contradictions is even more exposed. How can it mobilize all its strength to fight overseas at a time when politics has not yet stabilized. Fifth, Japan has carried out oppression and exploitation in the military occupied areas in China, but how much has it benefited the country's treasury? It is still a big question. French Indochina is also in its grasp, but it has no practical benefit at present. Normal management and normal profits are out of the question today. So, suddenly going to war with the United States, there are no new resources to rely on. Sixth, Japan has been striving for compromise with the Soviet Union, but it has achieved nothing so far. Not to mention that one day it cannot compromise, it cannot transfer the military equipment and all the power of the Soviet Union to other purposes, and there is a more serious worry about the rear. Even if it compromises, where is the guarantee? Seventh, the erosion of the Japanese army in China goes without saying. The quality of its navy and air force is far inferior to that of the United States. Although it is said that the geographical advantages and strategic advantages may make up for some of the innate weaknesses, and the decision of victory or defeat is not entirely tied to quality, even the Japanese do not deny that Japan has absolutely no certainty of winning a war against the United States. No certainty is adventure, and loyal patriots are unwilling to use the country's fate as an adventurous attempt. Eighth, Japan's international threats and intimidation diplomacy actually have its navy as its only support. In other words, the Japanese navy is its only bet. With its only bet, there is still something to be done, and losing its only bet means waiting to die. So, how can Japan throw its only bet against the United States? In summary, I do not believe that Japan dares to militarily attack the United States, nor do I believe that the United States and Japan will go to war.</p>
<p>However, Japan is losing ground in China and is at a loss as a result of its defeats. It is reversing course and acting recklessly because it has nothing to gain. Everything cannot be imagined using normal theories. Then how can we know that it will not be a "struggle for life"? To stop its recklessness, China must obtain effective international assistance as soon as possible and launch an effective counterattack as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Washington - State Department officials are now closely monitoring the situation in the Far East. Military circles say that if Japan occupies naval and air bases in southern Annam, it will have an excellent position to attack the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and the Philippines, and can cut off communication between the United States and Singapore. Several experts believe that the main purpose of the Japanese action is to encircle Singapore. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Batavia - The chief representative of the Dutch side in the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, has recently submitted a counter-proposal to respond to the Japanese proposal. The contents of this counter-proposal have not yet been obtained. Van Mook made a sharp rebuttal to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's statement on January 23 that Japan recognizes the Dutch East Indies as part of the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." At that time, he stated that the Dutch East Indies had decided to maintain the integrity of its sovereignty. Before the European War, 90% of the total imports and exports of the Dutch East Indies were not with the countries of East Asia, and it will continue to be so in the future.

<p>Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Dutch Minister to Japan, Pieter, notified the Japanese side on February 1, expressing his unwillingness to accept the proposal to incorporate the Dutch East Indies into the new order in East Asia under the leadership of any strong country. This was rejected by Foreign Vice-Minister Ohashi today. The Dutch note stated that the Dutch government could not allow its actions to be guided by the concept of the new order or tacitly acknowledge the consequences of the final implementation of the concept. According to Ohashi, the Co-Prosperity Sphere advocated by Japan only concerns economic affairs and has no political nature. Trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia will continue. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It was learned today that the Dutch Minister to Japan, Pieter, had met with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week because Japan had proposed including the Dutch East Indies in Japan's new order in East Asia. After Foreign Minister Matsuoka announced the plan to include the Dutch East Indies in Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Dutch Minister met with Foreign Vice-Minister Ohashi on January 31. The details of their talks have not been announced today, but according to news from London transmitted by the Japanese side, the Dutch Minister has been instructed by the Dutch government in London to reject Japan's proposal. (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Well-informed Japanese sources said today that the Dutch Minister to Japan, Pieter, protested because Japan had proposed including the Dutch East Indies in Japan's new order in East Asia. But Japanese Foreign Vice-Minister Ohashi has rejected the protest. Japanese sources said that the reason for the rejection of the protest is that Japan's inclusion of the Dutch East Indies in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is for economic reasons, not political reasons. Therefore, the negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands in Batavia will proceed on this basis. The words of the Dutch government in London will be ignored by Japan. Regarding this matter, the Yomiuri Shimbun warned the Netherlands that if the Netherlands relies on Britain and the United States, it will be attacked from all sides and lose its existence under Japan's Greater Asia.

<p>Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun said today that the Netherlands' rejection of Japan's demands is an open challenge to Japan by the United States. The newspaper said that the rejection of Japan's proposal was due to the United States' instigation. It also said, "Japan's southward advance is based on the absolute right to survival. Even if the United States implements obstructions, Japan should still maintain its position and continue to advance." (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington - The House of Representatives will hold a historic debate on the bill to aid democratic countries today. According to government officials, the bill is expected to pass by a two-to-one majority before the end of next week. The focus of today's debate may be on the President's power and the issue of American involvement in the war. The Republican leaders of the small group are preparing to propose an aid-to-Britain procedure including seven bills to attack President Roosevelt's aid-to-democratic-countries bill. The opposition's procedure is intended to greatly weaken the powers that the President would gain under the government bill. The Republicans will propose a procedure including a loan of $2,000,000,000 to Britain to purchase ammunition and other military supplies in the United States. Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declared last night that he would "strongly oppose any amendment that would destroy the aid-to-democratic-countries bill." At the same time, Republican leader Martin of the House of Representatives said that a majority of Republicans in the House would oppose the government's bill, "unless the bill is amended to limit the President's power." The Lend-Lease Act will be debated for three days, followed by publicly accepted proposals. Bloom predicted that the House would put the bill to a final vote on Saturday afternoon next week, while the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee would spend another week listening to the bill. Witnesses appearing this week will include many famous Americans, led by Colonel Lindbergh, who opposes the bill. Landon, the failed Republican presidential candidate in 1936, is expected to come out and support Lindbergh's opposition. The Senate Committee will hear testimony from former Wisconsin Governor La Follette and socialist leader Norman Thomas today. The committee will conclude the hearing procedure in a week, at which time Willkie, who is currently being recalled to the country, will appear as a witness for the government. It is widely believed that Willkie will fully support President Roosevelt. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will pass the bill next Monday and send it to the Senate for public debate in the middle of next week. (United Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Swedish Newspaper Comments on US-Japan Relations, Saying Japan's Actions Are Political Suicide <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>London - The Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet commented on US-Japan relations, saying that the main purpose of Japan's signing of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan was to intimidate American voters from supporting President Roosevelt, but it was a mistake. The effect it has achieved is the opposite of what it expected, because this move has given President Roosevelt a plausible reason to tell his people that the enemies of freedom are threatening the United States not only from the Atlantic side but also from the Pacific side. Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who was originally a junior envoy dispatched to Seattle, has never underestimated American resources. Now that he sees the unfavorable changes in the situation, he cannot hide his panic. The current international situation is very different from when the Berlin Pact was signed last year and the situation in Britain was extremely dangerous. Although Britain has shed a lot of blood, its lifeline has not been damaged and its nerves have not weakened. It has even joined forces with Greece to inflict heavy damage on Italy in the eastern Mediterranean, causing Germany to encounter a two-front war that divides its forces. Britain is now rapidly mobilizing the resources of its empire, and the United States is also preparing to facilitate its participation in the war. On the one hand, Matsuoka claims that Japan will fulfill its obligations to Germany, and on the other hand, he urges the United States not to openly intervene in the war, causing embarrassment to Japan. Japan had previously hoped to reach an agreement with the United States. If a non-interference pact could lead to a conflict between the United States and Japan, the Soviet Union would also be willing to do so, but the Soviet Union refused the request to supply China with war materials. Therefore, Japan's actions can be regarded as suicide by Japanese politicians. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Philadelphia - Retired US Navy Admiral Lejeune died at home yesterday after a short illness at the age of sixty-seven. Lejeune participated in the Spanish-American War, World War I, and the relief expedition to China. He received medals for his competence and decisiveness. From 1931 to 1936, Lejeune served as commander of the US Navy's battle forces. From 1936 to 1937, he served as the commander of the Third Naval District and the New York Naval Shipyard.

<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Times recently reported that Navy Minister Admiral Oikawa delivered a speech at the Navy Budget Committee of the House of Representatives yesterday to discuss the issue of air defense, saying that as far as I can see, it is better for the authorities to train people spiritually so that they develop a calm attitude of picking up bombs with their bare hands than to simply ask them to rely on bomb shelters and other air defense equipment. Someone then asked whether it would be appropriate for the House of Representatives to allocate 200 million yen for air defense expenses. Oikawa replied that air defense equipment should be enriched in accordance with the plan recently decided by the Cabinet. However, air defense affects all sectors of national life. Money alone is not enough to solve the problem. It must be given a reasonable amount of time to achieve success. Cities must also be expanded so that people can live in dispersed areas. National policy and air defense plans should complement each other so that cities can cope more easily when they encounter air raids. If various defense plans are carried out rashly, no matter how large the cost, it will be in vain. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e17">British Army Achieves Victory in East Africa; Captures Agordat; Italian Front Retreated to Obstruct British Incursion; Italian Division Surrounded in Barentu <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Cairo - The British army has occupied Agordat, a key strategic point in Italian Eritrea. The city has a railway to Massawa, a port on the Red Sea. The British army headquarters announced the victory, saying that the British army occupied Agordat on Saturday morning, capturing hundreds of enemies, seizing several cannons and mechanical transport vehicles, and destroying six Italian medium tanks, five light tanks, and fifteen cannons. When the British and Indian troops cooperated with the British air force to conduct the final attack, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. At dusk yesterday, the vanguard of the British army approached and pursued the retreating enemy toward Keren (50 miles east along the railway toward Massawa). The war in the Barentu area is progressing smoothly. Further south, Boiachenti is now in the hands of the British army. Many Italian troops originally retreating from Enhaga were captured. As a result of these military operations combined with the patriotic activities of the Arabs, the Italian army withdrawing from the Walcarte area was forced to abandon most of its mechanical transport vehicles and attempted to escape east along mountain paths. After the British army in Abyssinia applied pressure in the Midanma area, the enemy also retreated as quickly as possible along the highway from Midanma to Gondar, and the British mobile army followed and pursued. In Italian Somaliland, the British army crossed the border and continued to apply pressure to various areas, causing the enemy front to move backward.</p>
<p>British Army Concentrates in Libya</p>
<p>Regarding the Libyan war, a public announcement said that the concentration of the British army in the western region of Libya is in progress. Now that Agordat has fallen, the Italian vanguard line protecting Somaliland has also retreated, and the Italian army blocking the British army from penetrating northeastern Abyssinia from Midanma is retreating as quickly as possible. The Italian East African Empire is suffering a more serious blow. Although the Axis headquarters has reported that German bombers have participated in the Libyan war, the British army headquarters in Cairo said that the British army's concentration west of Derna is progressing smoothly, and the British air force fighters constantly patrolling the Libyan sky did not suffer any losses yesterday. According to Reuters air force defense personnel, it is widely believed that the German aircraft attempting to harass the British army's advance in Libya may be long-range bombers taking off directly from Sicily. However, short-range bombers can also participate in the battle after refueling at Libyan airfields.</p>
<p>About to Attack Asmara</p>
<p>After the British army occupied Agordat yesterday, it directly approached Keren, 50 miles to the east. The defenses of the town may not be as strong as Agordat's, but it is now expected that the British army's advance will be slightly slower because the area is mountainous, which is conducive to defense. Agordat was originally guarded by a large Italian garrison, and hundreds of them have now been captured. The rest have obviously escaped. A military spokesman said that the old army elsewhere is now in a "very sticky position" and has been besieged. Even if it resists stubbornly, it will only last for a few days. At the same time, the British mobile army is pursuing the Italian army into the interior of Abyssinia, and British artillery is bombarding the Midanma and Gondar areas, with shells falling like rain. The Italian army in the area seems to be panicked, because they only expected to encounter guerrilla warfare by patriotic Arabs, but they did not expect to encounter regular military operations that have already occurred. The British army has won in Agordat and is advancing toward Keren, which shows that the British army will attack Asmara as soon as possible. The area is a very important mountain position for the Italians. If the British army captures it, it can attack Massawa from above. The retreat of the Italian garrison in Barentu is now very dangerous. Since the natives of Abyssinia have made careful preparations for an uprising, the Italians may be forced to concentrate around the capital of Abyssinia and fight to the death. It is now believed that the situation of the Italians in Abyssinia is becoming more desperate.</p>
<p>South African Air Force Assists in Operations</p>
<p>South African British Air Force bombers went into battle on Saturday to assist the British army in advancing in several parts of Italian East Africa and attacked Assab, the second largest port in Eritrea, hitting ammunition depots. British aircraft also bombed motor transport vehicles concentrated in Mega and Awelo, and airfields in Chara and Laega, hitting military buildings. A British Air Force communiqué said that on Saturday, British aircraft in the Middle East flew offensive patrols, bombing raids, and reconnaissance all day long. All aircraft returned safely without any losses. British fighters continued to patrol the Libyan sky and saw two damaged enemy aircraft on the ground in Bas. A group of enemy aircraft flew over Malta and were attacked by British fighters, destroying two Italian Fiat biplane fighters. British aircraft also attacked the port of Vlora in Albania and other places. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Cairo - It was recently announced that the British army fighting on the Eritrean front has occupied Barentu, and it is now believed that an entire Italian division has been surrounded within this fortress.

<p>British Army Pursues Italian Army on All Sides</p>
<p>London - The British army is today pursuing the Italian army on all four fronts in East Africa. Only in Libya has the British army's advance been temporarily halted. At present, the British army in the area is concentrated west of El Agheila. The advance from here is no longer a flat area, but is full of broad, dry riverbeds that can hide a large number of enemy troops. Australian engineers have repaired the coastal highway that was destroyed by the Italian army during its retreat. The Italian army, which was defeated 15 miles north of Agordat in Barentu, is now retreating toward Keren, which is only 50 miles away from the port of Massawa on the Red Sea. In Abyssinia, British artillery fire is now bombarding the road between Mitima and Gondar. South African troops have completely eliminated the enemy troops that invaded various parts of Gondar and have initially invaded Abyssinia. The current location of the South African troops is closer to the Abyssinian capital of Addis Ababa than to their base in Nairobi. The fourth front is Italian Somaliland, where the British army is continuing to advance, and reconnaissance units have forced the enemy to retreat along the entire front. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>London - The Athens radio station claimed last night that the Italian army's attempted counterattacks in Albania were all defeated. The Greek army advanced rapidly and occupied new fronts and strongholds according to plan. These military operations are the beginning of a new stage in the Greek army's occupation of Albania. At the same time, the Greek army, which extended to the front line outside Klisura, also achieved a great victory and forced the Italian commander-in-chief, General Varelo, to order the Italian army in this important area to retreat as soon as possible. Foreign observers believe that any attempt by the Italian army to contain the Greek army's advance will fail, because the Italian army has suffered repeated defeats and its striking power has been greatly reduced. These observers estimate that the losses suffered by the Greek army in the recent counterattack reached four-tenths of the total number of Italian troops. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek General Headquarters issued a communiqué on Sunday night, saying that the nine-mile-long mountain range north of Klisura is now entirely in the hands of the Greek army. Most of the mountain range is located between Klisura and Berat, controlling the roads to Vlora and Elbasan. According to the Athens radio station, the recent battle has been the beginning of the Greek army's new offensive screen across Albania. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek Ministry of Information officially confirmed this morning that the Greek army had captured the entire top of an important mountain north of Klisura on the Albanian front. If so, Tepelene and Vlora are in danger of being completely isolated. Hundreds of Italian troops have been captured, including some Italian troops who recently arrived in Albania. After occupying the northern mountain peak, the Greek army can enter the coastal plain and cut off the retreat of the surrounded Italian army from there. The 15,000 Italian troops in Tepelene are now trapped within the Greek army's pincer movement. (International News Service dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens - It was announced here that British bombers attacked the port of Vlora in Albania again on Saturday despite the bad weather, hitting targets such as warehouses and ammunition depots. The Italian anti-aircraft fire was fierce, but the British aircraft still flew low and strafed an Italian artillery unit. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Vichy - French Prime Minister Pétain has recently revived his plan to resolve the French cabinet crisis by dispatching Navy Commander Darlan to Paris to confer with German Ambassador Abetz and other representatives on the issue of Laval's reinstatement, which Germany insists on. Newspapers in Paris controlled by Germany all claim that Laval's reinstatement is a basic condition for German-French cooperation. General Darlan's visit to Paris has brought the crisis in German-French relations to its highest point in 24 hours. The future of France depends on President Pétain's response to Hitler's insistence that Laval should rejoin the Vichy cabinet. A German official news agency's Geneva dispatch yesterday said that General Darlan was seeking to "hold talks" in Paris, but Paris "believes that the time for talks is not ripe until Vichy has recognized the current situation." The German news indicated that the deadlock in German-French relations would continue unless General Darlan fully complied with Hitler's demands. (United Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Vichy - According to well-informed sources, French Navy Minister General Darlan was originally scheduled to depart for Paris at 1:30 PM (Vichy time) yesterday, but this plan has now been delayed because Vichy is still discussing Laval's return to Vichy. Darlan originally intended to exchange views with Laval in Paris and then return to Paris with Laval, but some cabinet members still oppose Laval's return to Paris, putting pressure on General Pétain to abandon the plan to recall the former foreign minister. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Madrid - According to a Berlin dispatch published in Spanish newspapers, Hitler's letter to General Pétain, in response to Pétain's Christmas message, was a short letter with cold wording. The German Foreign Ministry did not make any affirmative comments on the matter, but according to the observations of Spanish people in Berlin, Germany does not seem to intend to take any severe action against France, at least for the time being. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London - The Times reported that former Vichy government foreign minister Baudouin, a friend of Laval, suddenly arrived in Vichy from Paris, probably as a prelude to Laval's return to the cabinet under German pressure. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - French Navy Minister General Darlan's efforts to reopen negotiations with Germany were rejected by the German authorities in Paris, so the French-German deadlock reached a critical juncture yesterday. President Pétain was originally scheduled to broadcast a speech on the Vichy radio station yesterday, but it is said that this plan has been suddenly canceled, and he has asked the pro-German former foreign minister Laval to confer. Rumors that Hitler's ultimatum to Pétain on Friday contained threatening language and made non-negotiable demands. (International News Service dispatch, 3rd)</p>

From now on, I will severely punish anyone who undermines law and order without leniency. At this juncture, our country has a new mission, and whether it can be completed in the future depends on the efforts of the people to abide by discipline. I firmly believe that we will be able to ensure the safety of the country's future. As for the recent incidents, it was caused by conspirators sneaking into the Iron Guard and inciting the group to disrupt peace. However, I believe that the loyal members of the group will be able to help me complete the mission. I hope that the people of the whole country can also be my shield." (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Luo Jing. General Antonescu, the Prime Minister of Romania, intends to reach an understanding with the Legionary Movement. In a declaration published in the evening newspaper on Saturday, he stated that he has always maintained friendly relations with the Iron Guard. Although the Legion swore allegiance to the King, its leaders still staged a coup. This must have been done by anarchists. In the future, any disturbances will be dealt with in the same way. Former government officials who have committed heinous crimes will be punished by exile. Those who loot will be shot. The youth of Romania should know their responsibilities as citizens. Romania and its allies need peace and order. He asks all Legion members to cooperate in reorganizing the country. (Haitong dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>London. Hundreds of British aircraft, mostly piloted by new American volunteers, carried out large-scale attacks on key ports and airfields in German-occupied areas yesterday. Bombers, protected by many fighter planes, concentrated their attacks on Ostend and the Boulogne area. It is widely believed that the above two places are the concentration points for the invaders to attack Britain. According to the British Air Ministry's bulletin, four German planes were shot down, and only one British plane was lost. It is reported that the newly organized "American Eagle Squadron" has been baptized by fire in this air raid. It is said that although Americans have already fought for Britain individually, it is the first time that a purely American air force has participated in the Royal Air Force. It is rumored that the German side's springboard for invading Britain has been hit the hardest by the British side, and many troop carriers have also been bombed. The Royal Air Force carried out air raids all day yesterday. It is rumored that the British Air Force only encountered a very small number of German planes over the coast and the English Channel. The British Air Ministry's bulletin stated that only a small number of German planes dropped some bombs in British territory. It is said that when several German planes saw British planes flying in formation over the English Channel, they turned back. There are two speculations about the inactivity of the German Air Force. First, Hitler has temporarily transferred most of his air force to Italy. Second, the German Air Force is undergoing major reorganization in order to prepare for a large-scale attack to cover the invading troops. (International News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>London. Small squadrons of British Air Force bombers attacked the German-occupied ports of Brest, Boulogne, and Ostend in the occupied areas of France late Saturday night and before dawn yesterday. Brest was first attacked by British coastal aircraft. Although the weather was unfavorable yesterday, coastal aircraft continued to fly to the coast of the occupied areas to patrol and scout, constantly monitoring the earliest signs of any aggression. Before dawn yesterday, two British planes attacking Boulogne and Ostend went missing. There was no enemy aircraft activity the previous night. A small number of enemy aircraft flew to the British coast alone for reconnaissance during the day yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>London. British newspapers yesterday warned the British people to prepare for the imminent German invasion attempt. Yesterday, the Royal Air Force conducted extensive bombing and reconnaissance flights along the French coast against German invasion bases. The weather was clear yesterday morning, the first time in two weeks after heavy fog, so British aircraft were able to take off to scout the situation of the German invasion bases. At the same time, the Royal Air Force and coastal air squadrons launched large-scale bombings, especially in Boulogne. More than 100 Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft covered the bombers in air raids on the occupied areas of France. British newspapers warned that Germany's renewed intensification of reconnaissance of various parts of Britain is the prelude to the start of the second "Battle of Britain." The newspapers also warned the public to be extra vigilant. Lieutenant General Fuller advised the public to stockpile several weeks of food in the "Sunday Pictorial." The "Sunday Express" warned the people that any collapse of the civilian front would have an adverse impact on Britain, which is also the main reason for the collapse of France.

<p>Wilkie Inspects British Bombed Areas</p>
<p>London. American VIP Wilkie inspected British bombed cities on Sunday, first arriving in Coventry, where he was guided by the bishop to view the destroyed cathedral. Wilkie was saddened by the ruined situation. Later, he took a car to inspect the historical buildings and residences that were destroyed during the German air raid in November last year. Wilkie told reporters about his impressions of visiting Coventry, saying that the descriptions of the destruction in the American newspapers were not exaggerated. He was particularly impressed by the great national spirit shown by the British. The disaster victims showed no signs of depression. The high tower of Coventry Cathedral still stands majestically, which can be regarded as a symbol of high national spirit. Wilkie then visited Birmingham and was deeply impressed by the equipment of the sheltered factories, saying that although the degree of destruction in Birmingham was astonishing, the reconstruction work he saw in progress was clear evidence that the Rongdu city could be restored. Wherever he went, he saw the British spirit of courage and determination. Without this, construction and reconstruction would be impossible. He believes that the United States will definitely provide assistance to Britain, so that the British people will soon be able to achieve victory with their courage and perseverance.

<p>Johannesburg. A serious conflict occurred here at the end of the week, involving thousands of people, including police, civilians, and soldiers. As of now, 140 people have been sent to the hospital, most of them soldiers. Armored vehicles patrolled the streets yesterday, and the situation in the city has now reached tranquility. However, outside the "Homeland Newspaper" office, the newspaper of former Prime Minister Herzog, and the "Transvaal People's Newspaper" office, which supports the republican policy, which were vandalized during the riots, there are still hundreds of people watching. The riots started on Friday night, when Rentengburg, the leader of the White Brandwater Party, which has anti-British sentiments and advocates for a republic, gave a speech at a cultural gathering. This meeting was not political in nature, and the order at the meeting was good. However, a conflict suddenly broke out in the street after the meeting, with the participation of many soldiers and civilians. Many of the civilians had beards, which is a symbol of the anti-British party members. The police came out to intervene, but the soldiers were quick to disobey. The story was repeated on Saturday night, and it ended until Sunday morning. The police used tear gas and batons to disperse the rioters. Cars were destroyed in the streets, and a police car was also burned. The police urgently sought help from other places, and the First Brigade of the National Volunteer Army was also dispatched to help maintain order. On Saturday morning, there were still soldiers on vacation in the streets. They attacked anyone with a beard they saw in the tram. The glass windows of many shops were broken. The soldiers tried to break into the anti-British party's office but failed. Then they turned to the back of the "Homeland Newspaper" office and destroyed its printing press.

Gada said, "The fighting on the African front in December last year was the most intense. This battle will soon enter a more active situation in the north and other fronts."

<p>A certain place in Northern Jiangsu. Because of the illegal acts of the New Fourth Army, its main force in Jiangnan has been resolved by the National Army. Since Guan Wenwei's troops in the Northern Jiangsu region searched Yue's defense zone and moved to the Dazhao area of Jiangdu last spring, they have been levying taxes in Sheka, confiscating civilian guns, destroying the administrative system, and luring young people from various places to go there. It is called training, but it is actually expanding the troops. In July last year, they invaded Huangqiao, raided the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Security Team led by He Keqian, and looted military supplies. In October, when the 89th Army was fighting fiercely with the Japanese army, they suddenly attacked the army, causing the martyrs led by Army Commander Shouwei to be killed by thousands. Yancheng and Dongtai counties were forcibly occupied, and Ji Fang was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Tongru guerrillas, intending to include the resources of the coastal cotton and salt reclamation area. In December, they concentrated a large army to besiege Caodian, wanting to eliminate the 89th Army, so that it could unite with the New Fourth Army in Northern Anhui. It was intercepted by the National Army stationed in the local area, and its plan was not successful. Then it fled back to Tongru and other counties, cutting off the borders of Rugao, Taixian, and Dongtai counties to form a special zone. Now that its main force in Jiangnan has been resolved, all of Chen Yi's troops wandering in Northern Jiangsu are panic-stricken. However, for the sake of lenient treatment, the National Army will not take resolute actions unless it is necessary, hoping that the troops can repent and automatically obey the reorganization order.

<p>According to the official announcement of the Public Works Department, the special meeting of foreign taxpayers, which will be reopened at 2:30 pm tomorrow, will not be postponed regardless of the weather. Also, the first step of this meeting is to vote on the amendment proposed by Lin Xiongyi to decide on it. The vote counters have been appointed as 22 people, including Adom Anderson and Enkson. Also, most of the reporter admission tickets issued by the Secretariat of the Public Works Department last time have been lost or misplaced, so new tickets were reissued yesterday, with the words "reopened" printed on them for identification. Representatives of various newspapers will not be allowed to enter without holding this newly printed admission ticket.</p>
<p>Quorum: No Full Amount Required</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening News, the special continued meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession will be held on February 5th. The Japanese taxpayers have agreed not to attend. Regarding what the result will be if the Japanese do not attend, when the reporter asked yesterday morning (3rd), there is no need for a quorum of taxpayers at the continued meeting, because February 5th is only to continue the previous meeting and will continue the discussion from the point where the previous meeting ended. The Japanese side stated that although the Japanese Taxpayers' Association and the Japanese Associations of various roads have all decided not to participate in the continued meeting, it is still difficult to say whether the Japanese will abide by this decision. At the same time, the Japanese Consulate Court in Shanghai is continuing the preliminary hearing of the case of Lin Xiongyi shooting and wounding three members of the Public Works Department Board of Directors, and secretly recording the testimony on this case. It is heard that the preliminary hearing will end at the beginning of this week.</p>
<p>Kaiserway and Others: Attend on Time</p>
<p>Kaiserway, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, although his left hand is injured and has not yet recovered, will still attend on time because he is the proposer of the surtax case. Vice Chairman Kana, although he has announced his retirement, will also attend because his departure from Shanghai to return to the United States is on February 8th, and he is the seconder of Kaiserway's proposal. Others, such as Director-General Philip, Assistant Director Nahi, Japanese Deputy Assistant Director Ikeda, Japanese Director Okamoto, and Western Director Cantongner, will all participate. Chairman Hill, Chairman of the Consular Body, estimates the agenda of the meeting. Because those who have already been discussed last time will not be repeated, the entire meeting can be completed within one and a half hours.</p>

<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening News, the continued meeting of the special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession is scheduled to be held at the Racecourse tomorrow (February 5th). A bamboo frame and sugarcane mat shed have been built on the grandstand to accommodate the taxpayers attending the meeting. However, at 2:30 am yesterday (3rd), two Japanese suddenly tried to set fire to the reed mat, apparently intending to prevent the continued meeting from being held. When the two Japanese committed arson, they exchanged gunfire with the White Russian Auxiliary Police officers of the Public Works Department Police Department stationed in the Racecourse. Although people were injured, the two Japanese poured flammable liquids from several bottles they carried onto the reed mat shed and the rostrum (more than a week ago, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and two Japanese members were shot and wounded on this platform by the Chairman of the Japanese Taxpayers' Association), and then set fire to a rented car of Taylor Motor Company (Certificate No. 2111). As of the afternoon, the authorities are still investigating the incident in order to determine who the arsonists are. However, it is generally believed that the two Japanese are in contact with the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai, because when they escaped from the Racecourse to the border of the western district of the Public Concession, someone saw them saluting each other with the Japanese sentries.</p>
<p>Expelled the Chauffeur: Drove Back to the City</p>
<p>According to the authorities' investigation, the whole incident had been carefully planned. First, at 2:10 am, a Japanese arrived at the Xinkang Road branch of Taylor's, rented a car, saying that he wanted to go to a certain gambling house on Haig Road. After getting in the car, the Japanese immediately told the chauffeur to drive to Nanjing Road. Then another Japanese carrying a large package got in the car. After arriving at the gambling house, the two Japanese told the chauffeur that they had changed their mind and wanted to continue along Haig Road. The chauffeur followed. Arriving at Ferguson Road, the two Japanese ordered to stop the car and "borrowed" the car from the chauffeur for use. The chauffeur refused, saying that he would be fired if he abandoned the car. One of the Japanese drew a Mauser pistol and pointed it directly at the chauffeur. He then exited the rear car door and entered the car from the front car door, sat next to the chauffeur, and ordered him to drive to Daxi Road with a gun. Arriving near the British military camp at the railway intersection, the two Japanese expelled the chauffeur, and then drove back to the city themselves.</p>
<p>Rushed into the Meeting Place: Arson</p>
<p>Arriving at the Racecourse Road, they drove straight into the Racecourse bamboo fence, causing a part of the bamboo fence to collapse. At that time, the car lights were off. A Russian policeman guarding the Racecourse tried to stop the car. The car lights suddenly shone brightly, blinding the Russian policeman. The two Japanese drove the car to the side of the reed mat shed and poured a bottle of liquid into a reed hut, which caught fire. But it was extinguished by a Russian policeman using his hands and coat.</p>
<p>Burned the Car: Shot the Russian Police</p>
<p>The two Japanese then poured liquid onto the reed mat shed and set fire to Taylor's car. The two Japanese almost believed that their plan had succeeded, and then opened fire on the Russian police and then fled. The Russian police returned fire. Because the sky was still dark, no one was injured. At the same time, the two firefighters guarding the reed mat shed, with the help of several Russian police officers, moved the burning car away from the reed mat shed. The two Japanese then ran across the Racecourse and apparently fell into the ditch along Jing'an Temple Road in the Racecourse, and then crawled out.</p>
<p>Re-Kidnapped a Car: Drove to Route des Soeurs</p>
<p>At that time, a Taylor's car on a business trip (Certificate No. 2102) was driving along Jing'an Temple Road. The two people were stopped and forcibly boarded the car in front of the Great Light Cinema, and fired a shot, piercing the car door. Whether its purpose was to intimidate the chauffeur or to chase the Russian police is unknown. The car entered Yu Garden Road and stopped next to the railway on Route des Soeurs. The two Japanese then gave the chauffeur 5 Japanese yen, and then left the car. The chauffeur saw the two Japanese walk to a Japanese sentry, salute each other, and after a brief conversation, they continued to walk towards the Japanese barracks.</p>
<p>The Police Investigate the Truth of the Case</p>
<p>Although the car arsoned by the two Japanese was extinguished after two fire trucks arrived, it was severely damaged. The police are still investigating the case in order to identify who the two arsonists are. As for the reed mat shed in the Racecourse, the damage was minimal. However, according to the firefighters, if the Russian police and the two firefighters guarding it had not taken prompt action, the shed would have been reduced to ashes. Richard, the Director of the Public Concession Fire Department, praised the Russian police and firefighters for their calm response this morning, risking the explosion of the car and stray bullets, extinguishing the flames, and moving the car away.</p>
<h3 id="e35">First Special Court and Office Both Bombed Yesterday Morning; Six Hand Grenades Thrown at Two Locations; Only One Car Damaged, No Injuries <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Court Staff Remained Calm and Continued Work as Usual</p>
<p>Between 4:00 AM and 4:30 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road and the First Special Court Temporary Office at 870 Weihaiwei Road inside the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School were each targeted with three hand grenades. All three grenades exploded at the Weihaiwei Road court, while only one exploded at the North Zhejiang Road court. Fortunately, it was late at night, and no one was injured. The following is a record of the investigation:</p>
<p>Three Grenades Explode, Fortunately No Injuries</p>
<p>At around 4:10 AM yesterday morning, someone suddenly threw three small, brand-new hand grenades over the wall of the First Special Court office on Weihaiwei Road. One grenade landed at the eastern entrance of the courtyard, one landed inside the western entrance near the wall of the Hardoon Garden, and one landed on the roof of the guardhouse in the courtyard square near the wall. All exploded. The most dangerous was the grenade on the roof of the guardhouse, as three or four guards were sleeping inside. If that grenade had landed and exploded, injuries would have been certain. Fortunately, when it was thrown, it hit a bamboo pole on the ceiling and exploded, resulting in only a hole in the roof. In total, the three grenades resulted in only a hole in the ground and the roof of the guardhouse.</p>
<p>North Zhejiang Road Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>The North Zhejiang Road court has long been guarded day and night by multiple Chinese and foreign police officers dispatched by the Huizhong Police Station, together with judicial police and guards from inside the court. Moreover, the court houses the headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, so there were even Volunteer Corps members on guard at the front gate. Yesterday morning's bombing occurred at 4:30 AM. The perpetrators, realizing the heavy security at the court gate, were unable to act. They then targeted the rear gate of the court on Qipu Road. The rear gate faces the Tongren Yizhong cemetery, making it unusually desolate. Outside the rear gate wall is a wooden utility pole. The perpetrators must have climbed the utility pole to throw the three grenades.</p>
<p>Three Grenades Thrown, Damaging a Car</p>
<p>One grenade landed in the women's prison square next to the rear gate and did not explode. One grenade landed in the open space near the women's prison gate and also did not explode. The other grenade landed on the court's walkway near the southern end of the rear gate, where two cars were parked: a Volunteer Corps small transport vehicle No. 15954 and Mr. Sifton's (a British member of the Volunteer Corps) personal vehicle No. 2169. The grenade exploded upon landing, but the blast was not powerful. The front left tire of car No. 2169 was blown out, and the left fender had two or three small holes. Car No. 15954 only suffered minor damage. No one was injured.</p>
<p>Court Staff Calm as Usual</p>
<p>After the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the Huizhong Police Jianglu Court rear gate retrieved three grenade caps and two fuses. The unexploded grenades on North Zhejiang Road were immediately placed under high alert. The two grenades were taken by the Volunteer Corps stationed at the court, immersed in water to neutralize the explosives, and then handed over to the police for research and investigation. Overall, the bombing incidents at the two court locations occurred close in time and involved three grenades each, indicating an organized act. However, the court staff remained calm about the incident and continued to work as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Our Newspaper Reporter Jin Huating Murdered Yesterday; Our Colleagues and All Parties Mourn Together; Corpse Will Be Prepared for Burial Tomorrow at 3 PM <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Our newspaper reporter, Mr. Jin Huating, was shot four times by thugs on Aidao Road while returning home from work at the hall, passing the South Motor Company near the east entrance of Beile Road at approximately 4:30 AM yesterday morning, fatally hitting vital areas such as the brain, abdomen, and chest, and immediately collapsed and died. The news spread, causing extraordinary shock and grief among our colleagues and friends in the news industry. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Suddenly Attacked, Died on the Spot</p>
<p>Since July of last year, due to the unrest in the situation, Mr. Jin had been paying attention to his personal movements. Usually, apart from working at the hall, he rarely interacted with the outside world. At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, when he finished work and was returning home, as he passed the South Motor Company on Aidao Road, thugs lurking there jumped out and pulled out a six-inch revolver, firing four shots at his back. Three shots hit him on the spot: one in the back of the head, one in the right breast, and one in the abdomen. The shot to the back of the head pierced through the forehead and even pierced a hole in his felt hat. He immediately collapsed and died, which is truly tragic.</p>
<p>Police Arrived, Thugs Fled</p>
<p>After firing the shots, the thugs concealed their weapons and fled towards the Mahe Road of the Public Concession. While fleeing on Mahe Road, they turned around and fired four more shots to prevent anyone from pursuing them. Police officers from nearby concessions heard the shots and rushed to the scene, finding Mr. Jin collapsed and dead. They immediately reported the situation to the French Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. The thugs had already fled far away. The detectives found several business cards and his personal pistol, as well as official documents, in his pockets, and stored them at the police station. Mr. Jin's body was transported to the Tairasite Road small hospital.</p>
<p>Dedicated His Life to the News Industry</p>
<p>Mr. Jin, whose courtesy name was Jie'an, was forty years old this year and a native of Jiande, Zhejiang. He studied at an early age and was exceptionally intelligent. He then went to the provincial capital to study and graduated from middle school, and then went to Beiping and entered university. After graduating, he immediately engaged in the news industry, working in the South China area. Later, he came to Shanghai and co-founded the Far East News Agency with friends, gaining a good reputation. In 1926, he joined this newspaper. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, Mr. Jin served as a war correspondent, and his detailed reports and sharp writing were valued by all parties. During the January 28th and August 13th incidents, Mr. Jin participated in almost every battle, braving dangers, enduring artillery fire, and going to the front lines to report battlefield news. A year ago, he was sent to Hankou to work by this newspaper. He returned to Shanghai when this newspaper resumed publication.</p>
<p>Preparation for Burial Tomorrow, All Parties Mourning</p>
<p>Mr. Jin's Shanghai residence is with his wife, Qiu Peizhen, who is thirty-two years old, and they have two sons (eleven and nine years old) and one daughter (five years old). His ancestral home is Jiande, and his mother is still alive. He was always eager to help others and did not manage his property, so his death is particularly bleak. This newspaper received a notice from the police station at around 7:00 AM yesterday, learning of the tragic news. Mr. Jin's family also received the news and were overwhelmed with grief. Due to the difficulty in completing the procedures in a timely manner, Mr. Jin's body will be transferred from the Tairasite Road small hospital to the Shanghai Funeral Home at 9:00 AM today (4th), and the preparation for burial will be held at 3:00 PM tomorrow (5th). After the news of Mr. Jin's death spread, colleagues in the news industry and friends from all parties sent letters to this newspaper and conveyed them to his family, expressing their condolences.</p>
<p>Central Government Comforts and Offers Generous Compensation</p>
<p>Chongqing, 3rd - Jin Huating, a reporter for the Shanghai Shenbao, was suddenly murdered by thugs in Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd. After receiving the report, the central government, recognizing that Mr. Jin had always stood at his post as a journalist, striving hard, and not being discouraged despite the difficult environment since the incident, was deeply saddened to hear the tragic news. It is heard that a reliable person has been dispatched to handle Mr. Jin's funeral affairs, represent and comfort his family, and allocate funds for generous compensation. The news industry in Chongqing, whether they knew Mr. Jin or not, expressed their shock and grief and expressed their greatest respect.</p>

<p>The American mail ship "Collinsworth," carrying relief medicine from the American Red Cross, arrived in Shanghai earlier this month after passing through Seattle, Norfolk, New York, Guam, and Kobe, Japan. The ship entered the port at 7:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The cargo consisted of two crates of crushed wheat and relief medicine, designated by the Red Cross General Assembly for relief in Shanghai. Based on the Baker Bothers' plan, it will be distributed in the occupied areas along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. It is learned that a large amount of medicine, equipment, and goods for refugee relief will be shipped from the United States to free China next month. From now on, aid to China will be unrestricted, with a total amount reaching one million US dollars, which will be transported through Java via Yangon along the Yunnan-Burma Highway.</p>

<p>After the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting reconsideration of the increased taxes, they received a reply from Tam Kuting, Superintendent, and Jordan, Administrative Superintendent. The translation is as follows: "In response to your letter of January 23, 1941, requesting consideration of increasing various taxes and economizing on various expenditures from January 1 of this year, we have received it. The opinions you raised have been carefully considered by this Bureau. When drafting this budget, this Bureau did not fail to consider various principles of economy. Since your association has taken the trouble to transcribe the expenditure budget numbers, your association should understand that nearly half of this number is used by the police department. Due to the increasing number of criminal cases, the number of police officers has also greatly increased. In addition, the various raw materials used for road construction also soared in 1940. The salaries of junior staff have also been greatly increased due to the high price of rice. This Bureau can predict that the budget may be exceeded unless the situation returns to normal, and it is felt necessary to increase the amount of work and make various improvements. We hereby reply and please note." It is heard that the association has requested the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council to continue to strive for it with the board of directors.</p>

<p>According to sources in the travel industry, since the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the number of passengers traveling to Burma has increased. However, recently the local government has imposed strict restrictions on Chinese immigrants. If the passport and other procedures are deemed non-compliant, they will be refused landing. Also, if changing ships in Singapore or Penang, it is necessary to obtain a visa from the British authorities in the Straits Settlements. In addition, Burmese tariffs are quite high, and passengers should try to keep their luggage simple to avoid trouble during inspection and detention by customs officials upon landing in Yangon.</p>
<h3 id="e40">China Needs Ambassador Johnson; Western Newspaper Pleads Sincerely; Johnson Has Made Great Contributions to Sino-American Relations; Do Not Easily Replace Such a Good Envoy <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that Washington is considering replacing Ambassador Johnson with Gauss as the Ambassador to China. The reaction of people here to this news has been mixed. Gauss has many friends in Shanghai and other parts of China, and they are naturally very pleased to hear that the former Consul General in Shanghai will be selected for the most important position in the American diplomatic service. Gauss is a trained diplomat, with rich experience in Chinese affairs and familiar with the situation in China. The United States sending him as Ambassador to China will undoubtedly make him a good envoy.</p>
<p>Many Contributions During His Tenure</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, all those who know Ambassador Johnson and have worked with him deeply regret the news that he will be leaving the Chinese stage. When Johnson came to China, he initially served as the Minister to China and was later promoted to Ambassador. During his years as an envoy to China, his actions can be definitely praised as one of the most valuable things in the American diplomatic tradition. Although we dare not compare Johnson's name with the most famous diplomats in American diplomatic history, such as Franklin, Johnson has absorbed China into his blood. After a pleasant chemical reaction, he not only loves his motherland but also loves the sister country where he is stationed, so that in the past ten years, Johnson and the Chinese mountains and rivers he loves have become a part of the Chinese landscape.</p>
<p>Sino-American Relations Are Getting Closer</p>
<p>In the past thirty years, the international diplomatic situation has been smoky and chaotic, but Sino-American relations have always been harmonious, which is deeply gratifying to Chinese and American people. Some people think that the good relations between the two countries are a matter of course, but we believe that this is the result of the excellent work of Johnson, Gauss, and other outstanding diplomats. The Far East situation in the past three years has brought Sino-American relations to an unprecedented closeness. The greatest contributor to promoting cooperation and harmony between Washington and Chongqing is undoubtedly Johnson. Johnson is the reporter for the Chinese situation, the advisor and assistant to the national academies, and also serves as a correspondent, reporting the official attitude of Washington to the Chinese government. Johnson's work is exquisite and neat, and there are very few diplomats who can do such excellent work. We do not want to use clichés and sing "There can be no Johnson for a day" at this time and place, nor do we want to nag and quote the proverb "Do not change horses midstream," but "There can be no Johnson for a day" and "Do not change horses midstream" are very appropriate to describe Johnson.</p>
<p>Continuing to Serve is Necessary</p>
<p>Johnson has a long history in Chongqing and knows Chinese affairs like the back of his hand. Therefore, it seems unwise to transfer him elsewhere at this critical moment in the Chinese situation. It is reassuring for both China and the United States to have Gauss succeed Johnson, but in the diplomatic arena, the human factor is extremely important. Now that Johnson has spent decades in China connecting with people here, this point is especially important in diplomacy. Therefore, the person who succeeds Johnson as Ambassador to China will undoubtedly find it difficult to follow the old rules when he gets off the bus. Although it is not the duty of ordinary people to appoint someone as an ambassador to a foreign country, ordinary people are undoubtedly responsible for promoting the welfare of China and the United States and continuing the friendship between the two countries. We believe that for the benefit of China and the United States and the people of both countries, it would be very obvious if Washington could allow Johnson to continue to serve as the Ambassador to China.</p>

<p>Regarding rumors that the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank of China have been ordered to withdraw, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks that the rumors of withdrawal are completely groundless. The Central Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China have recently established offices in the central area of the Public Concession to deal with everything adequately, which proves that the rumors of withdrawal are inaccurate. All business of the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks is completely normal.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Evaluation Committee Re-Evaluates Lower Rice Prices Yesterday; Public Announcement and Market Implementation Starting Today <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Rice Price Evaluation Committee evaluated fifteen kinds of foreign rice at prices ranging from 5.50 yuan to 5 yuan on January 18 of this year. The committee was instructed by the concession authorities to continue to evaluate lower price limits for foreign rice and strictly enforce them. In order to uphold the authorities' intentions, the committee held its fifteenth evaluation committee meeting at its headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Representatives from the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, the French Concession Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce attended to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Newly Set Price Limits</p>
<p>It was resolved, in order to uphold the intentions of the authorities and reduce the burden on civilians, to re-set the prices of the fifteen kinds of foreign rice as follows: (1) Saigon No. 1, 85 yuan (down 1 yuan), (2) Siamese No. 1, 85 yuan (down 2 yuan), (3) Saigon No. 2, 80 yuan (down 1 yuan), (4) Siamese No. 2, 79 yuan (unchanged), (5) Small Ground, 76 yuan (unchanged), (6) Fire Ground, 84 yuan (down 1 yuan), (7) Tokyo White Rice, 74 yuan (down 1 yuan), (8) Tokyo Brown Rice, 70 yuan (down 1 yuan), (9) Rice Tea, 73 yuan (unchanged), (10) No. 1 and No. 2 Mixed Broken Rice, 67 yuan (down 3 yuan), (11) Annam Brown, 86 yuan (down 2 yuan). The above eleven kinds are calculated by stone, that is, 160 city catties. (1) Saigon No. 1, 100 yuan (down 2 yuan), (2) Saigon No. 2, 94 yuan (down 2 yuan), (3) Small Ground, 92 yuan (down 1 yuan), (4) No. 2 Mixed Broken Rice, 80 yuan (down 4 yuan). The above four kinds are calculated by bag, that is, British-Chinese company original bag. It was also decided to announce the prices to the market and strictly enforce them starting today. Anyone exceeding the price limit will be reported to the authorities for severe punishment.</p>
<p>Stop Internal Transport</p>
<p>The total amount of rice currently stored in this city has increased to about one million bags, and in recent days, huge amounts of foreign rice have been continuously shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, if there are no speculators hoarding and manipulating the market, the food problem of the citizens of this city is promising. Although dredging the source of domestic rice is one of the important methods to stabilize the food supply for the citizens of this city, the most important thing to pay attention to at present is still how to continue to stop the hoarding and manipulation of speculators and the internal transport of grain stored in this port, because it is rumored that rice prices in the Yangtze River area are higher than in Shanghai. As for yesterday's price increase in the rice market, it is not worth learning.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Minhe Ship Detained; Zhejiang Authorities Find Out the Cause of Shanghai Ships Sailing to Zhejiang; Shipping Companies Did Not Consider the Consequences of Huge Freight Increases <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Since the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in China announced the blockade of the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces on October 16 of last year, and expanded the blockade to the seas of Guangdong province, most foreign shipping companies have been forced to suspend operations or be detained by Japanese warships under various pretexts. According to shipping surveys, the foreign ships forced to suspend operations include those on the Shanghai-Erh, Shanghai-Ou, and Fujian lines, totaling 27 ships. The rest are stranded in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>North and South Ocean Lines Barely Open</p>
<p>Currently, only the Nanhua Hong Kong and Beiyang Tianjin lines can barely maintain operations. Shipping on the Shanghai-Dinghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other lines is handled by Japanese shipping companies such as the "China Shipping Company."</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Resume Sailing, Zhejiang Coast Situation</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang sea route was blockaded, attempts by various ships to sail to the Aojiang estuary have failed. Compilations of goods without transport permits have been blocked. Recently, freight rates have soared. For example, the water freight from Shanghai to Aojiang can collect 1,000 yuan per ton, and Shipu reaches 750 yuan per ton. According to Ma Le, the rent of a thousand-ton ship is only about 7,000 yuan per day. Based on this calculation, the profit is huge. It is heard that a certain shipping company on Dashutang Street in this port spent a lot of money to cooperate and rent Xin Anli and Xin Anna to try sailing to the Zhejiang sea. Therefore, foreign ships have gradually become active in recent days. For example, Haikang, Haiyi, Feikang, and Anli sailed to Shipu, and Changde and Xin Anna sailed to Aojiang. It is also reported that Minhe was also cooperating and was unimpeded along the way, with freight rates ranging from 1,400 yuan to 2,000 yuan per ton. It has now been found out by the local military authorities that the ship has been detained, and the shipowner is handling it.</p>

<p>After the domestic postage rates were increased, the Postal Administration, in order to facilitate the public and in accordance with the newly revised rates, specially commissioned the Hong Kong China Bookstore to print new postage stamps with values of eight fen and four fen. However, due to the time required for casting and printing, a batch of eight-fen stamps commemorating the martyr Zhu Zhixin were printed first. The stamps are orange-red, and all the patterns are still in the original style. The Shanghai Post Office has now transported the stamps and issued them for the public to use for domestic mail postage. Other stamps with values such as four fen are still being rushed to print and are expected to be printed and issued soon.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Industrial Overview for Last Month <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Engineering Bureau Industrial and Social Office reported that although general restrictions on work continued last month, the sales of cotton textiles were quite active, and prices tended to be high, so the future of the textile industry is brighter. Other factories continued to operate as usual on weekends before the Spring Festival. It is said that the business conditions of factories manufacturing ironware, machinery, and electrical appliances were also stable, and their products had the opportunity to export to the Nanyang area. The electric bulb industry was relatively weak. The silkworm cocoons currently used by silk factories are the last batch of stock in this port. It is difficult to export cocoons and silk. The demand for condiments is strong, but there is a lack of the raw material gluten. The arrival of raw materials required by copper rolling mills is uncertain because some foreign countries have banned the export of scrap copper.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Two Employees of Mao Sheng Foreign Company Were Kidnapped One After Another Yesterday Morning; It Is Believed to Be Related to the Massive Theft of Copper Blocks; Both Concession Police Stations Are Strictly Investigating <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The American-owned Mao Sheng Foreign Company at 51 Guangdong Road previously had copper blocks and other metal materials worth 3 million yuan stolen by Portuguese national Hui Erte from its warehouse in Ruifeng Transportation Company, transported to Hongkou, and is currently suing Ruifeng Company for negligence of business with the American Consular Court, demanding compensation, and has been scheduled by the American Consular Court to summon and hear the case on the 11th of this month. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, two senior Chinese employees of Mao Sheng Foreign Company were suddenly reported to have been kidnapped, so the general public believes that this peculiar kidnapping case is not unrelated to the massive theft of copper blocks. One of the kidnapped people, Li Biao, a native of Yong, 46 years old, is the accountant of Mao Sheng Foreign Company. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Li went out from his home at No. 2, Lane 452, Dagu Road, to go to the company for business. Unexpectedly, just as he arrived at the entrance of the lane, five thugs suddenly rushed out, threatening Li and forcing him to board a black-licensed car No. 4615 (it is reported that the car is owned by a Japanese person) at the entrance of the lane and speeding away. Another person, Zhou Xindi, a colleague of Li, lives in the French Concession and left home at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to go to the company for business. Unexpectedly, he was not seen returning home for lunch at noon. His family called the company to inquire and discovered that he was missing.

<p>The Public Concession Police Department, recognizing the recent proliferation of clandestine gambling dens within the Concession, largely operated by outsiders, and seeking to rigorously enforce its anti-gambling policy, established a special anti-gambling squad. This squad has previously cracked down on multiple gambling dens run by Portuguese national Pan Boxiu and British national Hogan, handing them over to the Special No. 1 Court for strict legal punishment. Furthermore, the squad had previously discovered a large-scale gambling den operating on the upper floor of the Silver Palace Dance Hall at No. 982 Weihaiwei Road, Fuxu Road, and attempted to arrest those involved, but the gamblers had already moved upon hearing the news. Recently, the squad discovered that rooms 222 to 226 on the first floor of the same building were being used to operate a gambling den. Two of the rooms were used for betting on "Tai Sai," one for roulette, one for "Sha Crab," and one as a dining room. The remaining rooms were used as offices for the staff. The operation was of considerable scale, with extremely high stakes. The squad raided the premises at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, arresting on the spot Zhou Guansong, a Ningbo native acting as the accountant, as well as Chen A’bao, Wang Baojun, Qian Huiliang, Xu Rong, Zhu Huifa, Xu Zhuoyun, Zhang A’mao, and Chen Zhongfa, seven staff members in total. Gambling paraphernalia, opium smoking equipment, and various other items used for gambling were seized and brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special No. 1 Court. Police lawyer Fang Fushu explained the details of the case, requesting a postponement of the trial to allow for further investigation and pursuit of the masterminds. Following questioning by Judge Shen, the judge ordered the suspects to be detained pending a renewed hearing in one week.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Gambling</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, news emerged last night (February 2nd) that after detectives of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department cracked down on a gambling den run by foreigners on the upper floor of the Silver Palace Dance Hall at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Weihaiwei Road last Saturday and Sunday afternoon, they are now planning swift action to crack down on other gambling dens in the district. The locations and names of these gambling dens cannot be disclosed for obvious reasons. However, it is rumored that the police department has received reports of a certain club newly established by Chinese individuals but operating under the name of a foreign merchant, engaging in prohibited gambling activities. Therefore, the police are closely monitoring the club. It is said that since the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" signed an agreement on police powers in the western district last Saturday morning, all gambling venues in the western district are uneasy, fearing that they will soon be banned by the police. It is rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department is already studying action plans to cooperate with the soon-to-be-established Western District Police Force to expel crime venues from the western district.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Recent Developments at the National Southwestern Normal School: Implementing Border Education with Many Miao and Yi Students <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Correspondent from Zhaotong) The National Southwestern Normal School is one of the institutions responsible for organizing border education. In the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939], Cao Shutian was appointed as the principal. The school is located in Zhaotong, Yunnan. Since its establishment, the school's affairs have progressed rapidly. The latest situation of the school is outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) The school currently has one junior class and four simplified normal school classes. There are a total of 220 students and 27 faculty and staff members. In the summer of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940], the number of applicants reached 568, more than double the number from the previous year. There are also many Miao and Yi border ethnic students enrolled.</p>
<p>(2) Fifteen graduates from the previous one-year simplified normal school program are serving at the school and its affiliated elementary school, and five are working at the Yunnan Experimental Primary School. Only five are working in local education institutions. There is a regretfully insufficient number to meet demand.</p>
<p>(3) Because the school building is the borrowed Ji Family Ancestral Hall and the grounds are not large, students perform morning exercises and extracurricular activities by marching out of the city in formation, led by their class advisors and physical education teachers, for runs or short-distance hikes. Climbing competitions are regularly held in nearby mountains and fields, and students engage in labor such as washing clothes by the nearby river, making student life quite lively.</p>
<p>(4) Because various counties in Yunnan Province have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, government agencies at all levels have relocated to the countryside. The school negotiated with the reclamation department of a local industrial company to borrow newly built houses about 25 li south of the city as school buildings. There are eight classrooms, four offices, one faculty and staff room, and complete factory buildings and toilets. In the future, the school plans to lease some land from the reclamation department for students to engage in farming and production labor to solve the problem of student vegetable nutrition.</p>
<p>(5) In the summer of last year, the school was ordered to establish the Yunnan Experimental Primary School. The site has been surveyed in Kuixiang Town, Yiliang, Yunnan, where there are many Miao and Yi people. Establishing a school and providing education will surely have a great effect. The main campus is located in Kuixiang Town, using the original Wumiao (Martial Temple) buildings after renovations. The original township headmen were used to widely publicize the school, enrolling children from nearby Miao and Yi families. A branch school was established in Cuntianba, with two classes. It officially opened on November 1st of last year and also operates social education activities such as a people's school, a people's writing service, and a people's literacy assistance center. When adding classes this year, in addition to increasing class levels at the Kuixiang main campus, it is planned to gradually add branch schools in nearby villages with dense Miao and Yi populations.</p>

In the morning, it once rose to 18.6 yuan, and finally 18.48 yuan, an increase of 0.09 yuan compared to last week. Hong Kong notes rose with the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai. The demand for Japanese gold notes and Korean was strong. The market price rose across the board. The former rose to 1.6005 yuan, and the latter rose to 1.275 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Grains: Rumors Abound in the Foreign Rice Market, with a Continuous Flow of Overseas Rice into Shanghai, Leading to a Steady Increase in Inventory <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Since the tightening of the foreign rice market a week ago, the subsequent market closure on the weekly holiday resulted in no trading. Yesterday marked the first day of trading after the holiday, but sellers remained firm, rarely releasing stock. Local merchants, the general buyers, observed this behavior and were further influenced by rumors of certain warships blockading the Saigon harbor. They feared that their already dwindling inventories would not last the year and urgently needed replenishment. Afraid of market disruptions, they rushed to preemptively purchase, leading to uncoordinated competition. In reality, current inventories are abundant, so why be disturbed by unconfirmed rumors, creating opportunities for hoarders? There are reports that Japanese traders absorbed over 10,000 bags of small-sized rice in the market, transporting them for sale in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area. This has caused a moment of chaos and volatility in the market, with prices rising steadily and intensely. At the highest point, refined rice opened at 82.4 yuan, while small-sized rice, which had already seen a greater drop, was particularly firm, reaching 74.3 yuan. Prices only stabilized after reaching sufficient levels. Towards noon, sales slowed, causing a drop of about 50 cents to nearly a yuan. However, closing prices were still 2-3 yuan higher than the previous week. First-grade new Saigon was priced at 84.5 yuan and 83 yuan, second-grade at 80.08 yuan to 78-79 yuan, first-grade new Taraw at 82-83 yuan, second-grade at 79 yuan and 78.5 yuan, refined rice at 81.5 yuan and 81 yuan, Annam glutinous rice at 85.6 yuan, small-sized rice at 74 yuan and 73.5 yuan, Tokyo sharp-pointed rice at 72.5 yuan and 71.5 yuan, milled sharp-pointed rice at 79 yuan, refined broken rice at 70.05 yuan, and broken sharp-pointed rice ranged from a high of 66.5 yuan to a low of 61 yuan. Futures trading saw enthusiastic buying by speculators, driving prices up by 2-3 yuan. Newly arrived second-grade Saigon opened at 92 yuan, with insurance at 89.1 yuan, current small-sized rice with insurance at 88.7 yuan, without insurance at 87.8 yuan, one-month futures at 87.2 yuan, and two-month futures ranged from 85 to 87 yuan. Around 1,000 tons were traded. Approximately 15,000 bags of current stock were traded. New trades included Nissin selling 3,000 tons of two-month small-sized rice at 85 yuan per bag, and Xinchangcheng advancing 300 tons of first-grade Saigon at 93 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Dashunkang ship, managed by Xia Laochen Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai around 6:00 PM on February 1st (Saturday), carrying 24,000 bags of foreign rice from Haiphong. It docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, the Guangdong ship of Taikoo Company arrived from Hong Kong with 7,405 bags of foreign rice, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Additionally, the Taiyuan ship of Taikoo Company arrived around 6:00 PM last evening. The Minsheng ship of Jardine Matheson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 PM last night or this morning. Both ships are carrying foreign rice. The exact quantities will be investigated and reported later. It is reported that a large quantity of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai today from Saigon. (Zu)</p>
<p>The supply of thick and thin japonica rice suddenly increased yesterday, but local merchants, focused on foreign rice, found it less appealing, preventing the market from matching the pace of foreign rice and maintaining a stable state. Newly opened prices were similar to previous ones. Regular premium japonica rice remained at 107-108 yuan, spot price at 102-103 yuan, Kunshan premium japonica rice at 104-105 yuan, spot price ranged from 100 yuan to 97 yuan, Qingjiao thin paddy spot price at 95-96 yuan, original package at 99 yuan and 98.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice inventory is low, and supply is scarce. Sales are more active due to broader application during the New Year, unlike the stagnant market of last year. Prices have risen by about one yuan. Hong Kong special grade opened at 79.5 yuan and 79 yuan, Zhongguan at 76-77 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Vermicelli Sales Activated</p>
<p>The foreign vermicelli market is gradually improving. In past years, customer sales typically started around the Lantern Festival. However, procurement began earlier this year. North China merchants have already inquired about it. Amid the changing national landscape, people's minds are more stable, and local hoarders also intend to take the opportunity to buy. A total of over 5,000 bags of floral, bird, clock, chess, and mahjong-branded vermicelli were traded at 24.75 to 24.8 yuan, an increase of 2-3 cents from last weekend. Wild boar and flower god brands were priced at 25.6 yuan. Huachang's affordably priced vermicelli was at 23 yuan, with over 6,000 bags supplied by Fufu Factories and all purchased by local merchants.</p>
<p>Wheat inventory is depleted, and supply is extremely scarce. Overseas orders are also difficult to fully supply due to transportation difficulties. After wheat prices rose by nearly one yuan, Huachang and Japanese factories are unwilling to further lower prices for absorption. It is heard that Fuxin Factory has previously ordered a ship of Australian foreign wheat, which will arrive in port this week. Therefore, the factory is awaiting the supply of foreign wheat. Japanese factories' purchasing price remains at 32 yuan, with only 200-300 bags purchased at the gate.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Securities: Internal Debt Spot Trading Overcrowded <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The gray market for public bonds showed signs of volatility yesterday. Suddenly, there was an ample supply of chips, leading to overcrowded spot trading. After the Lunar New Year opening, for three consecutive days, partly due to the dividend payout and partly due to the recent unfounded rumors, small financial institutions sporadically sold off their holdings. Temporarily, the market became weak due to psychological vulnerability, with more selling than buying, and a sudden decline in new participants. This was a reversal of the previous enthusiastic state, making it difficult to raise prices in the near future. The opening yesterday was relatively stable, but then sellers suddenly became eager, leading to a widespread sell-off in the market. Tungkang, Sinfu, and Lianhe were all shedding, while Hengfu and Yizhong were also selling. Buyers Xinhua, Renchang, Lianyi, Gengxing, and Dahua were not showing strong interest. The supply exceeded demand, and the downward trend was difficult to reverse, resulting in the lowest closing prices. The result was a uniform decline of 10 cents to one yuan. Approximately 1.8 million yuan worth of bonds were traded. A brief summary is provided below:</p>
<p>The trading volume for Zhejiang Industrial Bank shares was 30 shares, with the price being 117.5 yuan, an increase of 3.5 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The opening of the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce saw prices trending downward due to various uncertainties. Subsequently, Jardine Matheson shares recovered from a low of 103 yuan, rising to 108 yuan. Other shares also followed suit. The closing market was stable, while rubber shares remained soft.</p>
<p>British Biffa Company, Limited, announced that they will be paying an interim dividend for the year ending February 28, 1941, at 50 cents (Chinese currency) per share on February 19th.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Yarn and Cotton: Spring Sales Gradually Stirring, Yarn Prices Reaching New Peaks, Shuangma Trading at 1,500 Yuan <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is strengthening, and the rising trend is particularly strong. New peaks are constantly emerging, and market transactions are exceptionally active. The amount of yarn released by the factory is approximately 20,000 bales, which shows the enthusiasm of speculators. At the same time, there are significant signs of development in spring sales in Hong Kong, leading to enthusiastic buying and the market steadily moving forward. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,507 yuan, with a low of 1,484 yuan. It was traded at 1,505 yuan in the afternoon, but someone was willing to buy at 1,506 yuan, but no one was selling. Today, 130 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Shuangma, due to the strong sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day, the market continued to rise. The opening price was 1,488 yuan. Once this price was set, buyers flocked in, pushing the price up to 1,495 yuan. However, a large amount of profit-taking emerged, causing a drop back down to 1,486 yuan. Upon hearing that gold prices had risen again and that exchange rates had narrowed, buying sentiment suddenly intensified, gradually pushing the price up to 1,507 yuan. Subsequently, profit-taking caused the price to drop again to 1,485 yuan. The closing price then advanced upward to 1,496 yuan. The trading volume for the morning was estimated to be 11,020 bales. Xinyu Factory released 7,000 bales of 20-count Shuangdiqiu yarn at a price of 1,270 yuan to 1,300 yuan. Yongan Factory released 2,000 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng yarn at a price of 1,400 yuan. The amount purchased by various groups is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Trade 8,400 Hong Kong 1,105</p>
<p>Mainland 1,500 Ningbo 15</p>
<p>Statistics 2,020</p>
<p>Fine Lint Jumps 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is rising along with the yarn market, and the rising trend is also strong. The raw materials for 42-count and 32-count yarn are experiencing stronger upward pressure, and the raw materials for 20-count yarn are also rising. Factories, both Chinese and foreign, have demand. The price of fine lint has jumped by 10 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose initially due to industry purchases, but subsequently fell due to weakness in Wall Street stocks and hedging. The closing price was lower than the previous day by 4-5 points.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to hedging and profit-taking, but then rebounded due to short covering and speculative buying, further strengthening the market. Yesterday, the forecast was for another half-rupee increase.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been bustling for days, reaching a fever pitch. The total trading volume exceeded 3,000 bales, with long-staple wool being particularly favored. Despite soaring prices, there was no shortage of those eager to buy. Given the difficulties in placing overseas orders and the need for all parties to hedge, those who hold current stock will certainly have a fortunate time.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Futures Soaring to New Records, Factory Cloth Market Optimistic <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market continued to rise yesterday, driven by the continued surge in Eastern cloth prices and market optimism. The sudden increase in demand for dyeing factory gray cloth pushed selling prices up uniformly. Fine cloth rose by 1-2 yuan per piece, fine twill rose by 50 cents to 1.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth rose by 25 cents to 75 cents per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by 1-2 yuan per piece. Local trading amounted to over 1,500 pieces of various cloths, with Guangdong and Fujian merchants handling over 200 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth, and Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou merchants handling over 100 pieces of poplin, colored cloth, and fine cloth.</p>
<p>The Eastern cloth market soared yesterday, with an astonishing rise. The leading fine cloth in the spot market opened in the morning at 48.5 yuan, jumping to 50.08 yuan, but profit-taking by retail investors pushed it back within the 50 yuan range. Due to a lack of chips, it returned to 50.025 yuan. As usual, there was no market in the afternoon. Gray market trading saw a sharp rise in futures, with prices soaring to around 52 yuan. 578 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 4th. The "Exchange's" leading fine cloth futures surged by over 3 yuan per piece compared to last week's market. The morning saw a rise followed by a correction, while the afternoon saw a straight upward trend. The first lot for February was 52.5 yuan, March was 54.04 yuan, April was 55.48 yuan, and May was 56 yuan. The second lot failed to be auctioned off until the closing. Therefore, the closing market prices were only available for April and May, with April at 56.9 yuan and May at 57.2 yuan, both new records.</p>

<p>Speculators in the miscellaneous grains and oil cake markets have shifted their focus to soybean cakes and maize. Yesterday, the maize market reacted to rumors of a ban on exports from Saigon, causing market activity to intensify, and buying became rampant. Spot prices rose sharply, but Yinghua's spot and futures prices rose in a straight line, with the peak surging by 1.6-1.7 yuan. Wuhu spot was trading at 29.5 yuan, Saigon spot ranged from 27.9 yuan to 28.8 yuan, Yinghua's spot ranged from 52.9 yuan to 54 yuan, then back to 53.8 yuan, with February delivery at 53 yuan to 54.3 yuan, then back to 54 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake spot sales were lackluster, and the market was entirely driven by manipulators. Prices rose sharply by 30-40 cents, but showed signs of softening at the close. The total daily trading volume was 5,000 pieces of spot cake and over 70,000 pieces of futures cake.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 300 bags of raw peanuts, 350 bags of peanuts, and 14,930 pieces of soybean cake will all be shipped to Hong Kong today (the 4th).</p>

<p>There was no market for raw silk in New York yesterday. Yokohama spot was 1,350 yuan, remaining at the original price. February futures were 1,380 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan from Saturday's market price. July spot was 1,397 yuan, also up about 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Local silk market trading is still difficult to develop because the Inspection Bureau has not yet inspected the goods. Trading by users is also sluggish, and most are in a state of expectation.</p>

<p>Charcoal prices, since the Lunar New Year opening, have remained weak due to the lack of customer sales. Although a small amount of ingot-shaped charcoal was released, buyers were few, causing market prices to trend downward uniformly. Original basket of Hukouxi Jiang charcoal was 14 yuan per dan, flat-hat charcoal was 16 yuan. The industry's wharf delivery, including carriage, was lower than at the end of the year.</p>

<p>— Luo Chen</p>
<p>After two years of traveling, I've finally returned to Shanghai today. The first thing I did was visit my family.</p>
<p>Actually, it's not my home, but my second sister's. When I left to go abroad, I entrusted my four motherless children to her care. As I entered the gate, I saw the youngest playing with blocks in the courtyard. She ran away shyly. The three older ones were sitting around a table reciting classical texts, and they also ran away from me, seeming not to recognize me (actually, they did). I saw the eldest, Mei, dart into the side room like a little mouse, whispering, "Second Aunt, Dad is back!" But the other three remained there like wooden chickens.</p>
<p>Second Aunt came out immediately. She saw me holding Little Long, trying to get her to call me "Dad" and kiss me. Little Long clearly wasn't very familiar with her dad and started crying because my stiff beard was pricking her.</p>
<p>"Little Long!" A thunderous roar made me quickly search for the source of the sound. It was my second sister. Her face was stern. "Daddy! Don't cry, or I'll hit you..." Little Long stopped crying immediately. She was scared into silence! Indeed, even I was startled.</p>
<p>But Second Aunt acted as if nothing had happened. She changed the way she was going to hit the child, instead taking the child's hand and leading her to me, saying softly, "Little Long is so good, so very good! Come on, call Dad..." But the child was still shy and didn't call me. She just looked at me timidly with her little, bead-like eyes. This made Second Aunt roar again:</p>
<p>"Call me! Call, or I'll—" The hand that had been stroking the child was raised again.</p>
<p>"Dad—Dad!" The child called out timidly. I saw that her small eyes were filled with tears, and I assessed Second Aunt's stern face. The child tightly closed her eyes, not letting the tears fall.</p>
<p>Second Aunt's anger hadn't completely subsided. She turned to the other three children, who were stunned by surprise. "Go read! What are you looking at?" The three children scurried back to the table like mice and started humming distractedly, their eyes constantly glancing at me.</p>
<p>The children recognized their father and pestered me to tell them stories.</p>
<p>I told them a story about Professor Maham.</p>
<p>"Are these things real?"</p>
<p>"Poor Lotte, she can't go to school anymore!"</p>
<p>"The Jews are so pitiful!"</p>
<p>The children asked innocently. In their pure hearts, they couldn't imagine that there could be such cruel things in the world. But the eldest, Mei, said:</p>
<p>"Did this happen in Germany?" Seeing me nod, she asked in surprise, "But Second Aunt said that Germany's politics are the best! Isn't that right, Dad?"</p>
<p>I was stunned by the question! Did my second sister say that? I wondered to myself.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I took the children to their grandmother's house. I was surprised that they seemed much more lively.</p>
<p>Third Aunt had just bought a piano, and the children swarmed around it like flies to blood:</p>
<p>"Piano, piano..." Then eight little hands started hammering away at the keys, making Grandmother laugh.</p>
<p>"Haven't you seen a piano before?" I clearly remembered that there was a piano in Second Sister's room. "Why are you so surprised?"</p>
<p>The children didn't answer. They were completely absorbed by the piano.</p>
<p>"Doesn't Second Aunt have a piano too?" I repeated.</p>
<p>"Second Aunt's piano?" Little Ling turned around and made a mischievous face at me, indicating that it was impossible.</p>
<p>The others all turned around too and said quietly, "We're not allowed to play that!" Then they all went back to the piano.</p>
<p>I thought back to what I had seen after arriving home.</p>
<p>Thing I dislike. Chen Qi made and cut. Also, remembering what Mei had asked this morning, my heart grew cold.</p>
<p>Ah! Poor children, you are as pitiful as Lotte. You are also living under fascist rule! (Rewarded)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Begonia <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Being an actor is nothing to be ashamed of. The only ones who are shameful are those who are called licentious actors," Shao Wen's calm and powerful voice seemed to grow louder and louder.</p>
<p>When Madame Wang handed the diamond ring to Begonia's chest, a celestial glow radiated from the face of this opera-singing young man.</p>
<p>Straightening his body, casting aside all the affected, tender demeanor he usually had, he fixed his eyes on Madame Wang's watery eyes.</p>
<p>"Madam, forgive me for not asking your honorable name, because I want to quickly forget this encounter today, and I also hope that you will quickly forget it! To put it bluntly, the matter today is that you want to use your money to buy me! But I'm very sorry! This transaction will not succeed! Because I don't want to sell myself, and I also know that I'm just an opera singer, and other than being able to play women on stage and sing in a high voice, I'm not worth a lot of money! So not only am I unwilling to sell myself to you, but I also advise you not to buy! If the purpose of you wanting to buy me is to make you happy, then I can tell you that it won't make you happy, and it will even cause you to lose the happiness you already have! While you still have your own happiness, let's just cancel this transaction altogether!"</p>
<p>This righteous argument was something that Madame Wang, who had been in charge of the household for five or six years and had enjoyed all the luxuries, had never imagined. An inexplicable force shot out from Begonia's eyes, which were usually very gentle, making her feel cold and unable to help but be stunned.</p>
<p>"I promise you that I will forget about today forever! You are still an innocent person!"</p>
<p>Begonia strode out of the dining room, his head held high, like a pastor just coming out of church. (21)</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Rice Boss's New Year <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Li Daguang</p>
<p>The rice boss is at least in his fifties.</p>
<p>Every morning, when the clock strikes nine, a fit of coughing breaks the quiet atmosphere of his home. A seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl—his concubine—helps him up, washes his face, and rinses his mouth.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, he reclines on the couch "swallowing clouds and spitting fog," then has breakfast and gets into a hired car to go to the foreign firm.</p>
<p>The first wife is a fat and large woman with a quick temper. Whenever the old man leaves, she stretches out her fat hand, yawns twice, and tells the maidservant to bring water for washing her face in her cracked-bamboo-pipe voice. Then she wolfs down breakfast.</p>
<p>Because she is the mistress of the house, one can always hear her "cursing from three doors down," unless she has fallen asleep like a pig.</p>
<p>After the hired car drops off the boss, it has to take the mistress of the house to buy groceries. The maidservant is left in the house to sweep the floor and wipe the tables and chairs. The concubine helps to tidy up the bedding.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the mistress of the house goes to watch Shaoxing opera. The old master is still at the foreign firm. The maidservant is washing clothes. The concubine then starts to do needlework and tells the people in the same room about her hardships.</p>
<p>She is a poor orphan. Her mother, pressured by life, sold her to the owner of this rice shop—our landlord.</p>
<p>She has been in his family for three years now. At that time, she was only fifteen years old, and she began to suffer a life of beatings, whippings, and insults.</p>
<p>She often sobs in secret, and she often has nervous breakdowns, mistaking the maidservant for the mistress of the house and kneeling down to beg her for mercy.</p>
<p>Three years ago, when the situation was very tense and many people were fleeing, this boss leased this building at an extremely low price and began renting out one room for fifty and two rooms for a hundred. Later, he gradually added ten or twenty yuan until now. Besides not having to pay for the house he lives in, he can also earn several times the money.</p>
<p>The boss's business is very smooth. Every night, after he eats dinner and smokes his fill of opium, he exclaims with great joy:</p>
<p>"...Saigon rice...has risen by forty yuan...Haha...I have six thousand bags of rice...you do the math...Haha!"</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, the boss sleeps at home. His smugness is indescribable. He eats and drinks heartily every day, humming Peking Opera tunes through his nose. He rewards the maidservant with ten yuan...this is a New Year's money, that is a reward...he is busy and happy.</p>
<p>On the first day of the New Year, when everyone congratulates him, he is like a madman. His usual snobbish appearance and disdainful gaze have all changed. He and the mistress of the house wrestle together, constantly shouting, "...Shrew...rotten goods...I can do whatever I want today...it's none of your business if I marry another one...Ah San! Come hit her..."</p>
<p>It turns out that the rice boss has bought another little girl.</p>
<p>They keep fighting, and as a result, the former concubine commits suicide. The newly bought little girl is forced by the mistress of the house to take poison. The old man himself is crying and wailing, as if he is lost and insane. Ambulances, police, detectives, and reporters have replaced New Year's guests and are busy in his home.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Naming <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The Beggar Shelter jointly run by the Rotary Club and the Salvation Army at the intersection of Singapore Road and Hedder Road in this city has sheltered over a thousand beggars since its establishment. Among them, two female beggars gave birth to a baby boy and a baby girl each a few days ago. It has been suggested that the two children be named "Salvation" and "Rotary" to commemorate the event, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e78">New Lineup in Shanghai Storytelling Theaters <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiu</p>
<p>Shanghai storytelling theaters invariably begin reorganization during the discarded lunar new year, readjusting regarding the number of storytelling groups, seating prices, and personnel; especially in enlisting popular groups to increase drawing power, in order to use a strong lineup and fresh appearance to compete with other colleagues in the same industry.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai storytelling theaters have always been monopolized by the so-called "Shanghai popular groups," revolving like a revolving lantern, and ultimately failing to produce any fresh taste; naturally, this year is also unlikely to be an exception, still unable to escape this old tune of changing the broth but not the medicine.</p>
<p>However, one more obvious fact is that the phenomenon of limited storytelling theaters and an overabundance of popular groups seems to be even more severe this year. This can be seen from the fact that first-class popular groups like Jiang Zhu and Shen Xue cannot find a place at all; Xu Jixiang of "Coughing Blood Four Officials" only has one theater at Huiquanlou, which is conceivable.</p>
<p>In terms of the current situation, the strength of the Oriental is naturally the most powerful. In addition to the master painter Xia Hesheng and the "Underworld Scholar" Zhou Yuquan, there is also the Zhuta group of Chen Wei. Chen Xuefang was Xue Xiaoqing's old partner fifteen years ago, known for his loud singing and clear speaking, while Wei Hanyang is erudite (son of Yuqing, and those who sing Zhuta nowadays, nineteen of them come from the Wei family), still faintly preserving some flavors of the Ma school; therefore, after Bai Shen Xue broke up, the Zhuta storytelling in Shanghai is quickly becoming their family affair. It is a pity that the Pinghua Han and Zhong groups are somewhat inferior.</p>
<p>Next is Fuchun. Zhang Hongsheng, the "Flying Airplane Hero," is revived here again and again, still attracting people steadily, and his momentum is gradually overwhelming Xu Jixiang and his teacher Jiang Yifei, truly fitting the saying "the younger generation is to be feared." In addition, Yang Renlin is also at Yunfeng, one playing and singing elegantly, and the other's storytelling is clear and refined, both possessing a unique skill and each having considerable drawing power. As for the others like Huyuan, Yalu, and Nanyuan, it is nothing more than these few people jumping around there, and I won't elaborate further.</p>
<p>Since the death of Wang Shouqing, the storytelling of "Record of Retribution" should be counted on his younger brother Shouzhang. Although his singing style is a bit too old, everything from storytelling to jokes, playing and singing is excellent, especially his pleasant Yu tune, which is truly beyond the reach of today's young people, so some even praise his art as surpassing his elder brother. Now coming to Shanghai, although only confined to the unnoticed Fengming Terrace, old listeners still do not fear the distance, flocking to him like ducks, and the popularity is undiminished.</p>
<p>Finally, the Yangzhou storytelling at Da Zhonghua, Kang Youhua, who performed during the day, has been dismissed, replaced by Mo Tianhong and other four groups of large and small storytelling, using Mo Tianhong's large-scale Pipa as a selling point. This is a new territory opened up by Guangyu Society this year; however, the strength is too poor, and it is ultimately not enough to be an rival of the nearby Oriental. Wang Shaotang's "Water Margin" at night continues to be performed, taking over the annual contract, and it is said that the business is really not bad.</p>
<p>The female storytelling groups at the Puyushe in Nanjing storytelling theater have also not had any new additions this year, only reorganizing the original groups. However, Xie Letian has gradually lost his leading position, reduced to singing the opening opera piece as the headliner, while the San Xu group is gaining momentum, surpassing him and now performing the "sending off the guests" piece at the end.</p>
<h3 id="e79">### Watching Opera at the Huangjin Theater <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, Huangjin's new star Wang Jinlang performed "Evil Tiger Village," and Li Yuru performed "Arching Plate Mountain," one being a Yang-style short-fighting martial arts play, personally taught by the famous teacher Ding Yongli; the other being transmitted by Wu Fuqin, a teacher at the Peking Opera School, imitating the posture and expression of Yanqiu and Huisheng, a martial arts actress with substance. When I lived in the old capital in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Wang Sheng Jinlu often performed the finale, and together with Chuan Dewei, who performed at Gengxin last year, was called one of the brightest martial arts students in the opera school at that time; the only difference between the two was that Chuan studied the Shang school and mostly performed long-bearded plays, while Wang searched for short-fighting plays, taking the singing, acting, reciting, and fighting of Xiao Lou as the standard. As for Jinlu's figure and appearance, he can be said to be exceptionally handsome, just like Xiao Zhenting back then. After graduating, he was painstakingly instructed by the old actor Ding Yongli, so his skills improved even more than before, and it is quite difficult for his voice to achieve such results after throat clearing (he is only twenty-one years old). Looking at the whole play of "Evil Tiger Village," the martial arts and figure are all worth watching, but when fighting with Tiandiao and Tianqiu, he seems a little too fast. If he can put in a few more years of effort, when the time comes, he will naturally feel calm and powerful, without the fault of being excessive or insufficient. Jinlu, encourage yourself! Although Yuru's pitch is not high, she sings melodiously and uses it freely, seeming to have deeply understood the essence of Huisheng.</p>
<h3 id="e80">### Written Before the Premiere of "The Thunderstorm" <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Su</p>
<p>"The Thunderstorm" is no longer a strange drama on the Chinese spoken drama stage, but this time, Mr. Fangxin re-translated the original work and, under his personal direction, the well-known Zhongqing Drama Society staged it with an extremely solemn attitude, which has already changed into a completely different and brand-new appearance.</p>
<p>I think this change in appearance precisely illustrates a leaping progress in the arduous growth path of the Chinese spoken drama movement. First of all, it enables the Chinese spoken drama audience to have a new understanding of this immortal world masterpiece, washing away the incorrect understanding of simply treating it as a hopeless tragedy of fate in the past, and further touching on the aspect of its social tragedy of struggle. The director especially strengthens the utopian character of Kuligin, more clearly reflecting the beating of the heart towards freedom suppressed by the old era. Here, we feel more truly that the roaring thunder and rain in the sky over the Volga River are not merely used by the technicalists solely to strengthen the tense atmosphere of the drama, but are the desperate shouts of the rebels of the old society in their breakthrough, and the sound of the collapse of the social foundation beginning.</p>
<p>Around us, fierce thunder and rain are also blowing—the desperate shouts of the rebels and the sound of the collapse of the old society, and our Tikhon and Kabanova have even greater cruelty and stubbornness. In order to guard this collapsing ruin and salvage their own dying fate, they are sparing no effort to move more bones of the old tradition, sacrificing the entire nation to intercept the new life. However, how much courage do our artists have to face this bloody reality, how much artistic image to convey the sound of such an era?</p>
<p>In the process of fierce national struggle, the spoken drama movement showed an unexpected boom, reaching the stage of establishing professional theaters. However, the weight of traditional suppression and the weakness of the foundation of the workers inevitably revealed a bloated appearance in this boom, and the conditions of professionalization further showed a dangerous tendency to cater to popular customs. At such a time, it is of great significance to bravely and boldly advance to the largest resistance line, try to make difficult dramas, and seek opportunities to observe and learn from world-class artistic works. Introducing "The Thunderstorm" is a very appropriate opportunity in this sense. This drama has abundant poetic sentiment, overflowing with poetic elegance and poetic unrestraint, and the meaning of its social lesson is completely integrated into the poetic mood. From its model, it can tell us that only when the artistic creator completely dissolves his object into his own flesh and blood life can he express this complete poetic sentiment, and only this poetic life is the life of art. Isn't this a very strong reflection on the Chinese spoken drama stage, which is full of abstract concepts, full of rigid, fragmented, and incomplete images? From this reflection, we should be vigilant!</p>

<p>— Edited by Lian Xuezheng of Putian</p>
<p>Bureau 249 Impasse Chen Wenxing intends Red goes first to win</p>
<p>Continuing to supplement the minor answer to the safety exercise published in the previous issue, move 35,</p>
<p>Marshal 5 moves to 4, to soldier 5 moving to 6 in 42 steps, is a draw. The variations are listed below. (Red goes first, draw)</p>
<p>Advisor 5 moves to 4 (Variation 1) Soldier 6 moves to 5 Marshal 4 moves to 5 Soldier 5 moves to 4</p>
<p>Advisor 5 moves to 6 Soldier 4 moves to 5 Marshal 6 moves to 5 Soldier 5 moves to 6 (Draw)</p>
<p>(Following Variation 1) Marshal 5 moves to 4 Soldier 6 advances 1 (List) Cannon 4 moves to 5 Soldier 5 moves to 6</p>
<p>Pawn 4 moves to 5 General 5 moves to 6 Marshal 4 moves to 5 Soldier 7 moves to 6 (Variation 2)</p>
<p>Cannon 5 moves to 6 (Variation 3) Soldier 6 advances 1 Pawn 6 moves to 5 Cannon 1 advances 1</p>
<p>Cannon 6 advances 2 Cannon 1 retreats 6 Pawn 5 advances 1 Soldier 2 moves to 3 Pawn 5 moves to 6</p>
<p>(Red wins) (Following Variation 3) Cannon 5 moves to 6 Soldier 2 moves to 3</p>
<p>Pawn 6 moves to 5 Cannon 1 advances 1 Cannon 6 advances 2 Cannon 1 retreats 6 Pawn 5 advances 1</p>
<p>Soldier 6 moves to 5 Marshal 5 moves to 4 Soldier 6 moves to 5 Pawn 4 advances 1 Cannon 1 moves to 6</p>
<p>Pawn 5 moves to 4 General 6 moves to 5 Pawn 6 moves to 5 General 5 moves to 4 Pawn 5 moves to 6</p>
<p>Soldier 3 moves to 4 Pawn 6 advances 1 (Red wins Following Variation 2) Soldier 7 moves to 6 Marshal 5 moves to 4</p>
<p>Soldier 6 moves to 5 Marshal 4 moves to 5 Soldier 5 moves to 4 Pawn 4 advances 1 General 6 retreats 1</p>
<p>Cannon 5 moves to 4 (Variation 4) Cannon 1 moves to 6 Cannon 4 advances 4 (Red wins)</p>
<p>(Following Variation 4) Cannon 5 moves to 4 Soldier 6 moves to 5 Pawn 5 moves to 4 Soldier 5 moves to 6</p>
<p>Pawn 4 advances 1 General 6 retreats 1 Pawn 4 advances 1 (Red wins)</p>
<p>According to this game, when the marshal moves from 5 to 4, in Variation 1, if the black soldier only moves to 5 and then to 6 and then to 4, it is a draw. If it moves to 7 or 3, there are variations, which lead to Red winning. This is a correction.</p>

<p>(Question from Mr. Tao Furen) I have been smoking cigarettes for a long time. Recently, I feel that smoking too many cigarettes is unhealthy, so I quit. However, after quitting, when I am busy in the office, it is not a problem at all. When I have free time, I feel bored, as if something is missing next to me, and my mouth is really so bland that it is tasteless and very boring. Sir: Is this the craving for cigarettes acting up? Is there any way to solve this free time?</p>
<p>(Answer) As long as you are determined, what are you afraid of cigarette addiction? Even opium addiction can be quit. The matter is very simple. As for when you are bored in the office and want to relax, why not make a cup of Horlicks malted milk drink? The main ingredients of Horlicks malted milk drink are malt extract, milk, eggs, and yeast. Not only can it replenish blood, strengthen the body, nourish the brain, and calm the nerves, but it can also restore fatigue, treat physical weakness, neurasthenia, anemia, brain deficiency, and insomnia. I guarantee that after eating it for a month or two, your body and spirit will be much fuller than before. The signs will be obvious at a glance.</p>
