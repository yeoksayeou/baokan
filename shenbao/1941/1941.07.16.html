<p>社評</p>
<h3>英蘇協定的意義</h3>
<p>自德蘇戰事爆發以來，就種種事態與表現言，早已說明了英蘇合作擊潰侵略勢力，殆已不成問題。世人倘仍抱有疑慮，則七月十二日在莫斯科正式簽字的英蘇協定，應該可以完全揭明了這個淸朗的國際形勢。協定第一條，對於合作擊潰「希特拉統制下的德國」這個工作中，彼此所給予對方的「援助」與「支持」，作了一個最廣泛最澈底的規定。第二條，特別訂明了：「在作戰期間，除互相同意外，雙方將旣不談判亦不締結任何停戰協定或和平條的。」雖然在字面上，沒有用軍事同盟等字樣、但像這樣廣泛而又很明顯的兩條規定，實際已把英蘇兩國，置於完全同盟國的關係之下了。假如把這和去年九月二十七日在柏林簽訂的德義日三國同盟一比，這個協定的字句，遠比三國盟的要堅强得多，肯定得多。</p>
<p>當然，這兩條不過是最基本最簡單的原則，一切詳細辦法和實施步驟，我們不難想像而得，現正由英蘇兩國當局和代表，分別在兩國首都談判之中。英國的軍事代表團，早就到了俄京，在英使克里普斯領導下，與斯丹林，莫洛托夫等當局，一直在舉行談判；而蘇聯的軍事使節團，也已到達倫敦數日，從民衆方面，他們獲着普遍的歡呼，從英國當局方面，他們受到熱誠的接待，在駐英大使邁斯基領導下，與邱吉爾，艾登等主要當局間，作披誠之商討。放在他們面前，搆成談判主題的，大槪不外兩方面：第一是同盟關係的確定，第二是軍事經濟等合作的實行。現在第一點算是已經有了明白滿意的結論，今後大家所注目的，僅僅是軍事經濟等合作的成功。</p>
<p>嚴格說來，以三個多禮拜的德蘇戰鬥過程而論，蘇聯的陣地，雖然略有後退，但牠的軍事情勢，顯然日趨堅强；即從最低限度說，牠的單獨遏止德軍前進，支持戰局的力量，大槪是絕無問題的。所以從純軍事的觀點，牠需要英國實力幫助，並不十分迫急，而最重要的意義，大槪首先不得不算國際政治方面，其决是經濟及資源的合作。路透社倫敦電訉所傳，英蘇協定的談判過程，是完全獲得了美國及英國各自治領的完全諒解和同意，這一點確具有非常重要性，所以英蘇協定更廣大的國際意義，在美國領導下的民治國陣綫，不啻是已經接受了蘇聯這一支强大的生力軍；在蘇聯呢，牠一向所堅持的正義戰，也不啻已承認完全應用到英美對德國的戰鬥。至於經濟資源的合作，美英之間，有羅斯福總統所發動主持的著名「租借法案」，今後美國將依照英蘇協定的精神，更進一步，將租借對象由中英兩國擴大爲中英蘇三國。果眞中美英蘇四國間經濟資源完全合作的話，那末，不獨實力雄厚，抑且顯然居於一面壓倒的優勢，即使在彼此通道方面，也立刻會呈現了了四通八達的狀態，從極北的北冰洋起，白林海峽，海參崴，太平洋上的英美屬地，以及中國沿海未淪陷區，中國的西南及西北大動脈，印度，近東，中東，黑海，裏海，大西洋，等等，無一不可作爲四國間經濟資源合作的通過孔道，而不必斤於海參崴港，滇緬公路，和大西洋等少數路綫了。這樣，不問東方西方的侵略者用什麼方法，也阻止不了四國間經濟資源上的交換補充和接濟。</p>
<p>除開上述一切外，要進一步避免世界長期戰爭的痛苦，及早擊潰侵略者，實現人類光明的話，當然的，仍不得不希望英國立即在軍事上和蘇聯呼應配合，發動攻勢，一舉而撲滅暴力最後的凶燄。英蘇協定雖僅是槪括的規定，但在完全同盟的原則下，英國當前所可給予蘇聯的軍事援助及策應途徑，却也非常之多，空軍方面，牠不獨可以乘德國防禦空虛，更擴大加緊對德國的轟炸，同時，牠也可以從近東根據地出發，派出大批機羣，參加德蘇間的空中戰鬥。海軍方面，牠可以在黑海，地中海，大西洋，北海，甚至北冰洋及波羅的海，用軍艦及潛水艇，對德義及其所胡附庸及被佔領各國，展開廣泛的突入的轟擊與進襲。陸軍方面，牠可以加緊非洲戰事，可以派兵在歐洲大陸海岸任何一點登陸，也可以通過土耳其進攻巴爾幹，甚至如有必要，還可以逕行派兵開入蘇聯，與牠駢肩作戰。當然這一切到底祇是就一般的可能途徑而言，如果按照實際情形來說，蘇聯當前軍事上所最需英國幫助的，恐怕還在於技術及戰具設計這兩點，尤其在海空兩方面，英國現在可以給蘇聯的助務，是很多的。</p>

<h3>英蘇協定締結後　軸心遭嚴重打擊</h3>
<p>兩國合作實係賢明政策</p>
<p>蘇聯過去行動應予諒解</p>
<p>大陸報對英蘇締結聯合行動協　、　日曾著文評論、認兩國此舉、確係賢明政策、茲迻譯於后、英蘇於星期六已正式締結協定、而成爲同盟國矣、雙方於協定中、規定相互援助、且保證不得單獨媾和、英國當局於談判中、必經縝密之考慮、而美國於事前亦必有所聞、</p>
<p>利害相同精誠合作</p>
<p>我人於現階段之局勢中、論述各項易於瞭解之國際協定、習尙皆寗抱模稜態度、然以目前之實例言、我人固無懷疑雙方誠意之餘地、以納粹德國業已成爲雙方深惡痛絕之仇敵、宜其兩國言歸於好、渴望相互援助也、</p>
<p>必能遵守條約精神</p>
<p>實昭示我人、英蘇遵守條約之精神、實較寡　之　人爲優良、蘇聯曾併呑波羅的海諸小國以及芬蘭·波蘭·羅馬尼亞之一部份土地、而遭受世界輿論之非難、然在對抗納粹侵略軍事之觀點上言、蘇聯已獲得較前史爲優良之地位矣、蘇聯於歐戰爆發時、其地位殊爲困難、此有予承認之必要、</p>
<p>英蘇結成聯合陣綫</p>
<p>昔德蘇協定簽訂時、一般輿論皆抱懷疑熊度、今日對英蘇締結此一協定、當可望無此種現象、英蘇兩國政府過去猜忌頗深、此爲不可吾認之事實、然蘇聯人士此决當深覺英蘇協定實際之收穫、超越德蘇協定遠甚該的對蘇聯人心激昂、未始無袖、且可對納粹士氣、予以絕大打擊、蓋該的對彼等說明英蘇已結成聯合陣綫、、希特勒削弱兩國團結之陰謀、今顯巳失敗、同時此協定復可增强蘇聯對日本之態度、使其能以充分理由、規勸日人、忠於蘇日協定、</p>
<p>對抗軸心賢明政策</p>
<p>誠如一般所料、德人決不甘束手待斃、必將陰謀組織反布爾塞維克之「十字軍」陣綫、俾遂其瓦解英蘇陣錢之詭計、然我人深信在邱吉爾領導下之英國政府、定不爲所動、而將以有效方法、祛除蘇人之疑慮、際此瞬息萬變之局勢中、英蘇協定誠爲加强對抗軸心國之賢明政策也、</p>
<p>日報促當局在北部戒備</p>
<p>本埠日文大陸新報、對英蘇協定咋日亦著文評論、認蘇聯不致受英美之煽動、而採取突然行動、而英美有通過蘇聯而以壓力加諸日本之可能、故該報警吿日木當局勿疏忽其在北部之戒備、蘇方於簽訂英蘇協定後、表示願對蘇日中立協定、信守不渝、該報對此點表示信任、但對英蘇協定之效力、表示懷疑、因此類協定、其與英法英波所簽訂者相同、甚鮮實際意義、</p>

<h3>證券　公債大漲</h3>
<p>統丙又穿出二元外</p>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市況經隔日之一跌後、又復大漲、戊種幾好一元、在信孚樂茂鴻大等買進一百餘萬、中丙種又穿出二元、但惜乘高多頭出籠者均得善價脫手、多方甲去乙來、乙去丙來、循環相生、輾轉相嫁、尙未知鹿死誰手、多方陣綫未能一致時、終未能脫盤旋狀况耳、昨上午交易、並無若何興奮、買方顧無大力、如信昌協康潤德潤利並無多大胃量、鼎康怡泰供給不少、均係多頭出籠、順泰亦有相當數量賣出、午收行市略高二三角、午後信孚進甲丙四十萬、樂茂進丙戊的三十萬、鴻大亦進的四十萬、生大九成等亦有一二十萬收進、鼎康及怡泰再行出脫、行市衝出二元外、中孚多頭出脫、十四號及同順均有脫手、聯和亦有三十萬供給、收盤行市較硬、市價結果、一致回高五角半至九角半、成交總數、約計三百萬允、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交登券交易所股五十股、價爲三十六元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市穩定活潑、價格一致向上、祥泰股重見前日高價、收盤六十七元、各著名股成交均盛、英聯股允爲出色、竟日盤旋於二十九元七五與三十二元、而以後者之價收盤、</p>
<p>倫敦十四日（週一）電、今日中國外償及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、祇麥加利銀行股獨升一先令三便士、爲八鎊十八先令九便士、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　客銷雖滯　紗價仍升</h3>
<p>紗市轉趨上升、但實際交易、依然清淡、不過同業心思大都看好、且上日申新紗廠之事、純屬子虛、於是多頭興緻父復濃厚、收買者頗不乏人、惟業外者仍向拋空方面進行、所以多空兩方爭持劇烈、二十支雙馬高價一千五百九十二元、低價爲一千五百七十三元、午後初做爲一千五百八　十三元、旋後漲至一千五百九十六元、最後價爲一千五百九十一二元、目前紗市因大漲之後、已見回風、暫時因客銷停滯、或有一度盤旋、亦未可知也、今日有棉紗一百六十件運香港、又四百十件運暹羅、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣較堅、且收買者皆係內行、首盤價爲一千五百七十三元、此盤買者允衆、少頃漲至一千五百七十五元、直上至一千五百八十四五元、此價迥旋頗久、有一部份因銷塲停頓、人心平凡、惟檯　較緊、多頭吸收之額、仍不放出、十一時半、漲至一千五百九十二元、豈料取引所收盤價忽跌十餘元至二十元、雙馬隨之下落十元、跌至一千五百七十九元、收價又兒回好至一千五百八十四元、查半日間成交統計五千一百十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港一一〇　同行五、〇〇〇統計五、一一〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市况、晨初開市、因外棉回漲均勁、匯市與金價亦均良好、因此新買與補空額多、七八兩月各比上日漲七元半至十二元、九月期漲十四元、開後買者更爲活躍、七月期竟高至一千四百四十一元、八月期一千四百六十元、九月期一千五百三十元、入後因客銷終覺太淸、多方從事獲利轉賣、價遂由高而鬆、午收七八兩月仍漲六元、九月期漲八元、成交一萬〇二百八十包、後市交易略减、市勢近堅遠平、結果七月期比上日漲十二元、八月期漲八元牛、九月期漲七元、全日共成交一萬六千二百四十包、比上日减少七千九百三十包、再將全日開收高低價錄左、　（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<h3>粗絨交易　獨見繁旺</h3>
<p>現棉情况略帶平靜、此因紗市回小之後、廠需較滯、所以人心稍平、惟粗絨本花異常稀貴、趨勢尙緊、因外棉不鬆、執貨者意態不肯賤售、大都遂呈觀望之象也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、活潑堅昂、因有雨量過多、及棉產收成不利、大衆購意熱烈、昨日收盤價格、較之上日漲十四至十九磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因空頭活躍而漲、繼之又歐州因出口商售出回跌、市况最後再因日商不斷買進而漲、結果收盤價格、各漲三羅比左右、</p>
<p>又預測今日開盤市况看漲二·七五羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况堅昂、成　熱烈、良以美印棉一再高漲、同時滬埠存底不多、大衆購意濃厚、連日不論花號家及中外商、廠方皆有大批巴西棉成定也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　疋頭試裝赴甌</h3>
<p>運南洋千五百件</p>
<p>廠布　昨市盤旋、人氣平淡、南路及本街現需均頗有力、溫州幫日內有試裝訊、惟首批貨祗裝舊有存貨、新貨添辦、尙須有待、售盤白貨粗細布斜紋一致堅定、漂染布上身貨價漲五角之譜、低　平平，本街成交各布五百餘件、粵港南洋幫辦粗細布漂染布二百數十件、北路烟台各幫辦期貨絨布等一百餘件、十六日有疋頭八百三十五件、運香港、又五十五件、運新加坡、又六百三十五件、運暹羅、</p>
<p>東布　始漲繼跌、結果平定、白貨龍頭細布廠單、晨盤一度升至四十九元八角、嗣以交易不旺、下午收盤回至四十九元二角、與上日價無榮辱、細斜因連新稅售盤稍升、藍雙魚牌後市做開四十三元四角半、色貨嗶嘰高峰見一元六角二分三七五、晚收降至一元六角一分三七五、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米盤小</h3>
<p>昨洋米再見盤跌一二元、緣連日到頭擁擠、存底日厚、而工部局新到港米小絞光後已有四五萬包、均經到埠待售、鏽作需胃有限、市面已見供過於求之象、而洋商續有兜售、客囤未敢暢辦、故開市後期現各米一致瀉跌、中市雖以價小引起內地客幫及浮戶趁小吸收、市面似可遂决回振、然以浮多散戶等續有吐出、結果終呈軟弱、收價仍比前日較小一二元不等、英華司小絞現貨曾有一百四十七元之價、期自一百五十一元二角至一百五十元零五角、二號暹米自一百四十二元八角至一百四十二元不等、碎米現貨小至一百零八元、期一百十一二元、總計成交七八百噸、現米亦小一元至二元不等、一號西貢一百三十元决至一百二十七元、二號一百二十二元、小絞自一百二十三元至一百二十一元半、次至一百二十元、碎米九十五元半、次八十九元、砶米一百十三元、次一百零八元、全日成交一萬五六千包、</p>
<p>洋米續有到埠、太古公司太原輪前日（十四日）傍晚抵埠、由香港裝來洋米一萬包、係工部局之平價米、該輪現停於浦東、定明晨移至法租界本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>厚　粳國米、續以到貨不　、銷場平淡、在貨主堅持之下、市面勉定、續開南港新鮮早晚稻一百四十二元半、决至一百三十九元、無錫原包白粳一百三十五一兀、宿粳一百三十二三元、</p>
<p>糯米、國元雖以時令關係、來源日稀、乃零星胃口、有必需之應用、續有動動、高自一百二十七元次至一百二十五元、但香港白元、則以受洋米影響、及本糯軋脚、消化頓滯、致貨主欲扳無能、行情帶軟近元、開高白元一百二十四元、次至一百二十元、糯菉未開、</p>
<h3>粉市動盪不定</h3>
<p>昨日麵粉市塲、交易不旺，因客銷未見聯蟬、木街納胃、雖動有限、且市面受米價續跌影響、執貨者均願隨市而脫、金龍粉初開僅三十二元一角、旋即回高至卅二元四角牛及三角半、收市價爲卅二元三角、砲臺粉做開卅三元至卅三元一角、尙有花鳥牌澳粉卅三元七角、（包過斤量）、其他雜脾、亦有少數直接配銷本街、粽計成交的有一萬餘包、市面尙在盤小中、至小麥供求兩寂、槪無正市、</p>
<h3>油餅　投機仍盛</h3>
<p>餅豆出口不少</p>
<p>食油　昂騰續勁、乃因來源仍滯、執貨者居奇之念愈殷、囤戶更乘機大事活躍、故行情一致又被拉提上升達三五元、統市　開膠州生油五十件、靑島生油四十桶、又豆油二十桶、大速豆油六十桶、浦東豆油二百桶、大有廠豆油一百担、又淸油三千多担、（價詳市價欄）</p>
<p>豆餅　昨市趨勢仍挺、緣因紗花幫等大戶依然搜羅不巳、兼以南洋幫去化已見活動、故人心堅俏、價比前又升二三角、計售開大有豆餅一千片、甡記豆餅現貨六千片、期貨二萬片，</p>
<p>十六日出口、豆子七百包、運厦門、又二千八百四十七包運香港、又二千叫百八十八包運新加坡、豆餅一千二百四十塊運香港、又一千塊運新加坡、又二千塊運暹邏、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球明暗俱鬆</h3>
<p>—每擔便宜一元—</p>
<p>煤球行情、月來因銷塲呆滯、本已明定暗鬆、日前更因某廠跌價、引起各廠響應、羣起削價、日來明暗盤已趨一致、義泰興·南洋·國華·同業自車、每噸兩百九十六元、小廠貨便宜四五元不等、門莊零售定價、每擔亦由十七元改爲十六元、便宜一元行情、然市上煤球大都早售十六元、</p>

<h3>展開申報「讀者助學金」運動</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本報讀者助學金勸募運動，開始不過三四天，就獲得了社會廣大的同情。承讀者踴躍捐款，復來函策勉，情緒熱烈，得未曾有，殊覺感奮！</p>
<p>其中最可奮筆直書者，是：大陸飯店侍者沈鳳標君來函，願每月節省二十元，供災童學膳費，至其職務解除時爲止。沈君以辛苦所得，來熱忱地贊助，眞太使人感激。本來，勸募助學金原是一種極有意義的文化運動，它有輯於一二大力者外，更須有廣大的社會層來支持，然後能發展能永久；像沈君能如此推轂，必可使後來者奮起無疑。</p>
<p>這樣一個時候，這樣一個環境，經濟生活已壓得人們久矣透不過氣來了，遑論精神生活；莘莘學子，經過無數的苦難，間關千里，負笈此地者有之，親屬於道路中成爲餓莩犧牲者有之，舉目無親，徒呼蒼天者有之，腸習藜莧，躑躅街頭者有之，然而他們底心還是堅强的，他們底目標與求知的慾望並未在顚沛流離中失去。他們需要麵包，更需要精神糧食！各種生活費用跟着少數投機者的夾袋而飛漲：一塊大餅要一毛，一本薄薄的書非要二三元不行，專門性的書籍更非百金莫辦。請你想想罷，大餅足以維持生命，用功讀書難道是浪費嗎？爲民族爲社會保持這一絲原氣，正是我們當前的責任。——他們承繼的責任則在後來！請不要忘記他們！</p>
<p>在困厄之中，不轍去學習的心，那是爲了客觀的現實的需要。在孤島上每見某種富家子弟，有上良好的修養倏件，却放棄了自己的天責，耽於歡樂淫靡，——一無埋頭苦幹的精神，祗發憤於自戕！我們不禁爲之長嘆。在另外一面，却有許多好學之士在緊束着肚子努力，有好些連進修的機會都沒有，他們彷徨莫適，在等待着社會熱心人士的同情。</p>
<p>這是誰的責任呢？</p>
<p>古來以補助寒士膏火爲莫大的美德，使他們在斷虀劃粥的境遇下發憤苦幹，如有所成就，便給授者受者添上光輝的佳話。這是優良的封建傳統道德，而在今日却更賦予新的社會意義了。</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭說：「惟英雄乃受艱困與試鍊的麵包。」爲社會培植人——使天下苦學種子怒發茁壯，不太功利主義地說，也是人生之大快事！在生活如此艱難中，像沈鳳標君等還慷慨地流露着眞情，使成道者得多助，其他一班有志之士何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>我們敬請大家伸出熱烈的同情之手來合作！</p>
<h3>小菜塲問題</h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>西摩路菜販生活堪虞　是否能另建一新菜塲</p>
<p>法俄是公道的人情的產物。</p>
<p>在報紙上看到一則新聞，那是關於西摩路小菜塲的遷移問題，原來這塊地產是屬於沙遜富翁的，可是沙翁忽「靈機一動」欲將「小菜塲房地改爲堆棧」——於是這富有歷史維持攤販生活的小菜塲在沙翁的堅決的態度下不能存在了！</p>
<p>或許將使些主婦們煩惱。但起恐慌的是這些可憐的攤販，他們住於斯，食於斯，無疑，是解決了生計，這一次限於「八月卅一日將該菜塲停閉」，在生活艱苦的今日，攤販們橫着這一個大的「災難」其苦痛是非局外人所想像的。</p>
<p>於是最後的辦法只有　律師訴諸法院了，可是據報載，「攤販並無勝訴希望」而「從純粹之法律觀點上言」，英國法律中是對地主規定有自由處置產業的權利，攤販訴於法律之前，這又會遭到必然的失敗。</p>
<p>照人情講起來，沙翁旣是千萬鉅富，不妨另行購買空地建造堆棧，而小菜塲並非「慈善機關」，攤販每年繳納的房租雜費，這筆收入也很可觀了，從時間上說，這是一個甚麽時候？百物高昂，生機日窮，攤販們的飯碗，要被打破了。</p>
<p>至於「善後」問題工部局方面透露的消息是遷併跑馬廳小菜塲，不過猜想起來，並不十分可能，第一跑馬廳小菜塲已塞滿了攤販，第二，在下層社會的公　塲所有一定的「碼頭」，西　路攤販移向跑馬廳小菜塲似有「搶碼頭」的意味，而且會影響到跑馬廳攤販的營業，第三，地以稀爲貴，而跑馬廳小菜塲旣已塞滿了攤販，西摩路小菜塲的攤販再搬來，菜塲的房租雜費，或不免發生問題。</p>
<p>所以這個辦法還有商榷之必要。</p>
<p>最「幸運的解決」當然是建築一座新的小菜塲，不過，在工部局是不是打算到這筆費用的支出呢？還是成問題的。一</p>
<p>這個問題，望大家注意一下。</p>

<p>上海電車公司和中國公共汽車公司的車價，於十四日起居然又漲價了。這决電車提高的票價，「頭等平均每英哩自六分三厘七，增至九分一厘一，三等平均每英哩自四分八厘七，增至七分　厘九，」（例如無軌鷺車大世界至南京路前售七分者現售一角五分，至四川路橋，前售一角二分者，現售二角）其所持之理由，爲的是「匯兌續縮，和國外戰事關係，燃料來源不易，各項開支激增，公司方面投資應得之純益减少；」那公共汽車公司的理由：「爲自上年十二月間修改票價後，各項物價無不劇漲」加以發給職工津貼，以致開支激增，應付困難，故請求提高車資」云云。</p>
<p>收人减少，天然是生意不好，不够成本，當然是漲價的一法了。戰後「孤島」崎形發展，居民叢集一隅，租界當局，會經宣佈，界內居民，較之戰前，增加數倍，公共汽車和電車的乘客，當然擁擠非常，車輛也不够應用，這種情形，兩公司的當局總也曉得的。</p>
<p>但是乘客旣然擁護，那公司方面的收入，反而减少，一再增加票價，市民的負担，固然覺得不勝其重，試問公司方面，對於每决增加票價，究竟能得多少的實惠呢？確是一個疑問，不想治本的方法來增加純益，因所謂收人减少，而一再漲價，將來恐怕公用車的票價，會比人力車還要貴啦。到那時候，乘車的人，未必還能像現在的擁擠吧。</p>
<p>「×翁，貴棧如何了？」</p>
<p>「也好，下陣雨濕潤濕，幾年來的陳米，漲大了，重也重一點。」</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>「這一學期眼看是沒有希望！」梅寳坐在一具小風爐的前面，用葵扇搧着爐子裏的炭，沒精打采地看着爐子上面擱的一個瓦製的藥罐，心裏暗暗這樣想。</p>
<p>不錯，今天已是十月二十日了！衡水縣立中學是九月一日開學的，爲了秋海棠的病，梅實已缺課快兩個月了。</p>
<p>十幾年來，秋海棠的確已够勞苦了，體力儘管因爲不斷鍛鍊的綠故，已比他在舞台上賺幾千幾萬的時候，壯實了許多，但和一般的農民比較，總還差一些：所以每天操作之後，他總比張小狗子顯得更疲乏。同時他的曲折而凄凉的身世，又像一塊大靑石似的終年壓緊在他的心頭上，使他覺得很少有歡喜的日子；到了晚上，什麼都靜下來了，而他的思想却再也不能寗靜，往往擾得他通夜失眠，冉加爲了他要省錢，穿的吃的，都非常的苦，慢慢地不覺就把病根伏下了。</p>
<p>這一年秋天，梅寳想收拾好東西，湊開學以前趕進城去的時候，——他現在已是初中三年級的摹生了——秋海棠突然病了；起初只像是瘧疾的樣子，他照例又固執着不願請醫服藥，待到病勢加重，再把大夫請來，他的病已變成傷寒了。</p>
<p>「孩子，不妨事的，你還是念你的書去吧！」他也知道開學的日子已近，不願妨碍他愛女的學業，便再三催促梅寳進城去。「我有小狗子看顧，何必再把你留着呢？」</p>
<p>梅寳當然是捨不得走的，便再三不肯，硬生生地又留了幾天；秋海棠已病得不省人事了，從此梅寳便日夜在他床前服侍着，不覺就在充滿了藥氣的病室裏，度過了四五十天。</p>

<h3>波浪聲樂社印象記</h3>
<p>— 未</p>
<p>上星期日晚上，由友人的介紹，參觀一個音樂團體——波浪。</p>
<p>一走進弄口，我就隱隱的的的聽到一片雄壯的歌聲。在今日到處唱着「襟上一朶花」軟綿綿的催眠曲的孤島上，偶然聽到了另一種歌聲，心裏自然是很興奮的。</p>
<p>然而進門以後，使我倒抽了一口冷氣，原來道是一間小小的敎室，裏面坐滿了男男女女的靑年，熱和悶，他們似乎一些也不覺得，只是拉直了喉嚨唱，臉上都掛着汗珠。</p>
<p>「女工歌」，「不准別人通過」，「祖國進行曲」，「火炬」，……這正氣的歌聲，熱烈的情緒，包圍了整個屋子。道裏是一些有思想有血氣的靑年。</p>
<p>在散的時候，我同該社的音樂領導印翀拉了拉手，又和總務張潮，作了一次談話：</p>
<p>「請你吿訴我一些關於波浪的情形。」</p>
<p>「很簡單的，波浪是幾個業餘的靑年組織的，我們沒有後臺老板，自然也沒有大量的經費。房租，講義，油墨，一切的開支，除了靠社員每月四角錢的會費收人以外，就是由熱心者自動捐助，我們每星期日，聚集一次，藉以調劑疲勞的精神。」</p>
<p>「你們唱的歌，是不是都屬於硬性的？」</p>
<p>「這倒不一定，有時也唱軟性的，不過總是有意義的歌，甚麼哥哥啊，妹妹啊，這個調調兒我們不哼。」</p>
<p>「最近可要舉行演出嗎？」</p>
<p>「我們決定在九月六日，作一次籌募基金的演出，屆時，還要請陳歌辛，張昊等音樂導師來幫助，並且以唱「天倫歌」著名藝壇的朱明小姐，她也答應客串。」</p>
<p>辭出來時，雄壯的歌聲，還在我耳際縈繞着。</p>

<h3>China's Arduous Four Years of War: Manpower Replenishment Increasingly Robust; Regular Army Increases from 1.7 Million to 5 Million; Army Quality Improves; All Newly Equipped with New Weapons</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Minister of Military Administration He issued a statement declaring that China's regular army at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War was only 1.7 million, but now it has reached 5 million. In addition, there are 10 million reserve soldiers and 800,000 guerrillas. Since the outbreak of the war, soldiers' equipment, training, and experience have greatly improved. There have been 1,966 battles, with major battles accounting for 47% and minor battles accounting for 80%. The Chinese army has taken the initiative in nine major battles. Except for Nanchang, Yichang, and Zhongtiaoshan, the other six, in Suixian, Northern Hunan, Northern Guangdong, Southern Guangxi, Southern Henan, and Northern Jiangxi, all defeated the Japanese army. In the first year of the war, the Japanese side deployed twenty divisions, thirty and a half in the second year, thirty-five divisions in both the first and fourth years, and currently thirty-six and a half divisions. (Omission) The statement concludes by encouraging the people and military to obey the orders of the supreme commander. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Chief of Staff He Yingqin delivered a broadcast speech yesterday entitled "Four Years of Military Operations," which contained many valuable data: (1) The Chinese regular army numbered 1.7 million at the start of the war, but now it is 9 million. Guerrillas are scattered behind Japanese lines, and 800,000 of them are paid by the government. In addition, 10 million replacement troops are constantly maintained. (2) All troops have been completely re-equipped with new weapons, and they are uniformly standardized. The quality of the army has also improved. (3) Before 1939, the Chinese army was only attacked. From January of that year to the end of June of this year, of the 1,966 large and small battles, 47% of the important battles and 80% of the minor battles were initiated by the Chinese army. In the nine most important battles, except for Nanchang, Yichang, and Zhongtiaoshan, the other six completely defeated the Japanese army. (4) The Japanese army used 20 divisions in 1937, 30.5 in 1938, 35 in both 1939 and 1940, and 36.5 this year. Although the number of Japanese troops has increased, there has been no progress, which proves that China is becoming stronger as it fights. (Havas, 15th)</p>

The American mission in China is to strengthen the civil defense line. The American side now understands that China is a barrier to peace and order in the Far East. He declined to discuss the future, saying that events are happening extremely quickly and it is not convenient to predict. He also said that Chairman Chiang is a symbol of China's unity.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, various events and expressions have long indicated that Anglo-Soviet cooperation to defeat the forces of aggression is hardly a question anymore. If the world still has doubts, then the Anglo-Soviet agreement formally signed in Moscow on July 12 should completely clarify this clear international situation. The first article of the agreement makes the broadest and most thorough provision for the "assistance" and "support" given to each other in the work of cooperating to defeat "Germany under Hitler's rule." The second article specifically stipulates that: "During the war, unless mutually agreed, both parties will neither negotiate nor conclude any armistice agreement or treaty of peace." Although military alliance and other terms were not used in the wording, such broad and obvious provisions have in fact placed the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in a completely allied relationship. If this is compared with the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan signed in Berlin on September 27 last year, the wording of this agreement is much stronger and more certain than that of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>Of course, these two articles are only the most basic and simple principles. We can easily imagine all the detailed methods and implementation steps, and they are now being negotiated by the British and Soviet authorities and representatives in their respective capitals. The British military delegation has long arrived in the Russian capital, and under the leadership of British Ambassador Cripps, they have been holding talks with Stalin, Molotov, and other authorities; and the Soviet military mission has also arrived in London for several days. From the public, they have received universal cheers, and from the British authorities, they have received warm hospitality. Under the leadership of Ambassador Maisky to the UK, they are conducting sincere discussions with Churchill, Eden, and other major authorities. Placed before them, constituting the theme of the negotiations, are roughly two aspects: the first is the confirmation of the alliance relationship, and the second is the implementation of military and economic cooperation. Now, the first point can be regarded as having a clear and satisfactory conclusion, and from now on, everyone's attention is only on the success of military and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, based on the more than three weeks of the German-Soviet combat process, although the Soviet Union's position has retreated slightly, its military situation is obviously becoming stronger day by day; even at a minimum, its ability to independently contain the German advance and support the war situation is probably beyond doubt. Therefore, from a purely military point of view, its need for the help of British strength is not very urgent, and the most important significance probably has to be considered first in the area of international politics, followed by economic and resource cooperation. According to a Reuters London dispatch, the negotiation process of the Anglo-Soviet agreement has been fully understood and agreed by the United States and the British Dominions, which is indeed of great importance, so the broader international significance of the Anglo-Soviet agreement is that the democratic national front under the leadership of the United States has accepted the Soviet Union as a powerful new force; as for the Soviet Union, the righteous war it has always insisted on has been recognized as fully applicable to the Anglo-American fight against Germany. As for the cooperation of economic resources, there is the famous "Lend-Lease Act" initiated and presided over by President Roosevelt between the United States and Britain. In the future, the United States will, in accordance with the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, take a further step to expand the lend-lease object from China and Britain to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. If economic resources are fully cooperated among the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, then, not only will the strength be strong, but it will also obviously occupy an overwhelming advantage. Even in terms of mutual access, a situation of accessibility will immediately appear. Starting from the Arctic Ocean in the far north, the Bering Strait, Vladivostok, the British and American territories in the Pacific Ocean, and the unlost areas of the Chinese coast, the southwestern and northwestern arteries of China, India, the Near East, the Middle East, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, etc., can all be used as conduits for economic resource cooperation among the four countries, without being confined to a small number of routes such as the Port of Vladivostok, the Burma Road, and the Atlantic Ocean. In this way, no matter what methods the aggressors in the East and the West use, they will not be able to prevent the exchange, replenishment, and supply of economic resources among the four countries.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the above, in order to further avoid the suffering of a long-term world war, defeat the aggressors as soon as possible, and realize the bright future of mankind, of course, we still have to hope that Britain will immediately respond and cooperate with the Soviet Union militarily, launch an offensive, and wipe out the last fierce flame of violence in one fell swoop. Although the Anglo-Soviet agreement is only a general provision, under the principle of full alliance, there are also many military assistance and response routes that Britain can give to the Soviet Union at present. In terms of the air force, it can not only take advantage of the German defense being empty and further expand and intensify the bombing of Germany, but also send a large number of aircraft from its bases in the Near East to participate in the air battles between Germany and the Soviet Union. In terms of the navy, it can use warships and submarines in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and even the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea to launch extensive and penetrating bombardments and attacks on Germany, Italy, and their vassals and occupied countries. In terms of the army, it can intensify the war in Africa, send troops to land on any point on the coast of the European continent, and can also attack the Balkans through Turkey, and even, if necessary, can directly send troops to the Soviet Union to fight side by side. Of course, all of this is only in terms of general possible routes. If we look at the actual situation, what the Soviet Union most needs from Britain militarily at present is probably still in the two points of technology and war equipment design, especially in the naval and air aspects, Britain can now provide a lot of assistance to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Tibetan Compatriots Unite Sincerely; Work Hard to Build the Nation</h3>
<p>Holding Administrative Conference of Three County Bureaus</p>
<p>Raising Two Million Yuan to Engage in Reclamation and Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>Lanzhou - The three county bureaus of Xiahe, Lintan, and Wu Ni in southwestern Gansu Province are places where Tibetan compatriots in the Northwest live. Hu Gongmian, the commissioner of the area, in order to plan and pool the strength of the masses, develop the frontier, and strengthen combat strength, specially requested and obtained the approval of the provincial government to convene an administrative security meeting of the three county bureaus at the Black Guan Temple. More than 260 people attended, including Huang Zhengqing, the commander of the Labrang Security, the heads of various county bureaus, and representatives of Tibetan compatriots. It was an unprecedented grand gathering in the Tibetan area. Gao Yihan, the supervisor of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and Zhao, a member of the provincial government, personally came to guide the meeting, which lasted from June 26 to 29, a total of four days. Eleven major cases were resolved, and specific discussions were held on various items such as Baojia production, finance, transportation, public security, education, and health. The provincial government was requested to adopt and implement them. Among them, the case of monks and civilians in Lintan County jointly investing 2 million yuan to establish the Taoxi Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company best demonstrates the enthusiasm of Tibetan compatriots to participate in national construction. On the day of the closing ceremony, all the representatives attending the conference also jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Chairman Gu to pay their respects, and sent telegrams to comfort the frontline soldiers.

<p>Chongqing - This morning, various Chinese-character newspapers in this city gave prominent coverage to the news of the Sino-British exchange of notes on abolishing consular jurisdiction, returning concessions, and revising treaties. They unanimously welcomed Britain's posture as another symbol of Sino-British friendship and cooperation. The Central Daily News's 　comment stated that this move is noteworthy because it shows that cooperation between civilized countries is becoming closer. As the war continues, the number of enemies of the Axis powers will inevitably increase, and their strength will become stronger. Our struggle is gradually gaining international sympathy. We firmly believe that the sympathy and assistance of friendly countries will continue to increase. The Sino-British exchange of notes is an important achievement of Foreign Minister Guo, and is another step in closer cooperation with the Central Government. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles on All Fronts Day and Night, No Change in Soviet Positions</h3>
<p>Naval Battle Breaks Out in the Baltic Sea</p>
<p>Sixteen German Ships Sunk</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 15th – The Red Army General Headquarters stated that the Red Army has continued to resist enemy advances for the third day, still fighting to defend Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv. The Red Army has also launched numerous counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the German forces. Soviet air force continues to bomb German motorized units and the Polotsk oil region.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 15th – An Exchange Telegraph Moscow correspondent reported that Timoshenko, leading the Western forces, has launched offensives in several locations north of Rogachev and has crossed the Dnieper River. After crossing the river, Soviet forces drove back the German army by eighteen miles.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 15th – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a recent communiqué last night stating, "On the night of July 14, battles continued in the Northwest, West, and Southwest sectors. Soviet forces resisted enemy tank and motorized unit offensives, launching successive counterattacks and inflicting heavy losses. Soviet forces in the West and Soviet aircraft destroyed hundreds of enemy tanks and many enemy vehicles. In the Southwest, they repelled an attack by a large enemy force of three thousand, capturing a significant amount of artillery, machine guns, vehicles, and munitions. On July 13 and 14, the Soviet Air Force conducted night raids on enemy airfields, delivering powerful strikes to enemy troops, tanks, and motorized units. On the night of July 12, enemy transport ships carrying troops and tanks passed through the Baltic Sea, escorted by destroyers, patrol boats, speedboats, and fighters. The Soviet Baltic Fleet, in coordination with aircraft and coastal artillery, delivered a heavy blow, sinking two destroyers, thirteen transport ships, and one giant flat-bottomed boat carrying tanks. Thirteen other transport ships and one destroyer were damaged and caught fire. Soviet warships and aircraft suffered no damage."</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 15th – Military analysts here stated yesterday that the Soviet forces resisting in the central sector have effectively halted the German advance. A major battle for Leningrad is almost inevitable, as Leningrad is threatened by Finnish forces from the Karelian Isthmus and by German forces from the Southwest. German forces transferred from Lake Peipus to the Estonian front have cut off the Soviet army and navy's retreat routes in that area. The Soviet forces in that area can only escape by sea, but a large number of German torpedo boats and motorboats are patrolling the waters, preventing their withdrawal. It is reported that German forces moved troops southeast from Lake Peipus yesterday, attacking Pskov, a key hub of the "Stalin Line," with the support of tanks.</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>United Press, London, 15th – It was heard on Berlin radio yesterday that German assault troops, after forcibly crossing the Dnieper River, have advanced to the outskirts of Mogilev, eighty-five miles southwest of Smolensk. It was also stated that Soviet forces are defending Mogilev with extreme stubbornness, firing at German troops from the window openings of various buildings.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – The German official news agency released information stating that German aircraft bombed railway lines near Leningrad and Smolensk, and military targets in Kyiv with considerable success. Railway traffic was disrupted by the bombings, and warehouses and water plants were set ablaze. Soviet forces concentrated in the areas of Bialystok and Zhytomyr were also attacked, suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 15th – The German government news agency reported that German forces advancing towards Leningrad have captured new Soviet territories, defeating scattered Soviet troops. German forces took advantage of the gaps broken through the Stalin Line on Saturday and Sunday to advance towards the upper reaches of the Dnieper and Daugava rivers. Soviet efforts to resist were ineffective, suffering heavy losses and no longer holding positions at Vitebsk. The German air force continues to bomb Kyiv, burning warehouses and water plants, destroying trains, and disrupting Soviet transport. However, reports from abroad that German forces have already occupied Kyiv have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Havas, Helsinki, 14th – General Headquarters issued a war report stating that on the north bank of Lake Ladoga, our forces, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on enemy positions.

<h3>British Prime Minister Announces in the House of Commons: Britain and the Soviet Union Conclude Alliance</h3>
<p>Says This Move Will Greatly Benefit the War Situation</p>
<p>Urges That Soviet-Polish Compromise Be Realized</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – Prime Minister Churchill made a statement in the House of Commons today, formally announcing the conclusion of an alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union. Before making this statement, the Prime Minister briefly addressed matters in the House, saying that he was quite concerned about the overseas impact of the recent production debates. Statements such as that Britain's industrial performance only reached 75 percent of standards, and the chaotic situation within the aircraft production department, were all enough to make the United States and the Dominions believe that we were mismanaging things and not putting forth our full effort. These remarks, no matter where they are transmitted, will cause serious damage, especially since this is only a one-sided account and cannot represent our great and well-managed efforts. It is regrettable that he was unable to participate in the debate from beginning to end due to many other matters. It should be known that the accusations made by the various cabinet members at that time could obviously not provide considered responses, which is distinctly different from debates during peacetime between the parties. He has carefully read the official report of the debate and has ordered that the more serious questions be sent to the relevant departments (cheers) so that they can be studied. He proposed that another day of open debate be held on various matters soon, and he himself will make a detailed statement on the entire issue to the extent permitted by the public interest. He hopes that this will dispel any impression of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued to speak about the Soviet Union, saying, "It was not until the end of last week that the British and Soviet governments were able to conclude a solemn agreement, jointly undertaking to continue the war against Germany under Hitler's rule, providing mutual assistance to the greatest extent possible, and not making a separate peace. The signing of this agreement and the announcement of its contents are of great benefit and potential for the future of the war. This agreement is naturally of an allied nature, and the Soviet people are now our allies." (Cheers) Foreign Secretary Eden is also strongly promoting the realization of a compromise between the Soviet Union and Poland. Although these negotiations have not yet reached completion, with General Sikorski presiding over the matter, there is hope that another important step will be taken soon.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then expressed his satisfaction with the end of the Syrian war, saying that he had hoped to include the terms of the Syrian armistice agreement in this statement, but its final form had not yet been released, so he was unable to do so. Currently, some minor revisions have been agreed upon regarding the agreement, but the British government is completely satisfied with its outline. The Prime Minister finally responded to a question from a certain member regarding the debate on the Middle East, saying that he proposed to start the debate himself, and then anyone could ask questions publicly. Someone then asked if the Prime Minister would answer the questions himself, and the Prime Minister replied amidst laughter, "I will try my best to make the debate lively."</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – Official sources here state that since arriving in Britain, the Soviet mission has been in close contact with the British Chiefs of Staff and the Minister of Defence. General Golokov and Colonel Traagan have now returned to Moscow to report on everything and will return to London soon. At the same time, the mission, led by Admiral Karalimov, is currently working without any obstacles. The British government hosted a banquet for members of the Soviet mission at the Claridge's Hotel yesterday. British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander presided. In addition to members of the mission, other guests included Soviet Ambassador Maisky, Air Marshal Poutier, Admiral Pont, British Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Lieutenant General Bonar, and several representatives from the British armed forces.</p>
<h3>Britain Determined Not to Stop Fighting Until Nazi Regime is Eliminated</h3>
<p>Will Expand Scope of Air Raids on Germany</p>
<p>Will Use Their Own Methods Against Them</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – British Prime Minister Churchill said in a speech at a luncheon of the London City Council yesterday that British bombers will continue to bomb German cities and industries until the Nazi regime is destroyed by the British Air Force or overthrown by the Germans themselves. The resilience and courage shown by British ports and towns when they were repeatedly attacked by enemy aircraft are no less than those of London. We must now ask ourselves, will the air raids happen again? We have assumed that they will happen again, so months ago I asked the Home Secretary and the Minister of Health to make all kinds of preparations to prevent air raids as intense as before or even more intense than before in the autumn and winter. I know that things are now underway to increase this kind of preparedness. Air raid shelters have been strengthened and improved, with lighting and heating equipment. Fire lookouts have also been improved, and many new arrangements have been made. If air raids resume, London will be prepared to deal with them. If Londoners vote tonight on our conclusion of a public agreement to stop bombing cities, most people will surely shout "No!" We will use the German's methods against the Germans, and we will repay them double. (Cheers) Londoners will certainly unanimously say to Hitler, "You have done everything evil! You have been most rampant where resistance is weakest. You are the originator of indiscriminate bombing. We cannot forget Warsaw in the first few days of the war. The tragic massacre of the southern capital is still imprinted in our hearts. We also know deeply the barbaric attacks you are currently inflicting on the Soviet people. We sympathize with the Soviets' heroic struggle. (Cheers) We will have no truce or peace talks with you. You will exert your strength, and we will also exert our strength!" (Cheers) Now it is almost our turn to show our skills. We live in a terrible era in human history, but we are confident that it is just to return this to the enemy. Now is the time to make the Germans also taste in their own cities the pain that Germany has repeatedly inflicted on its neighbors and the world for decades. We have been intensifying our systematic and scientific bombing of German towns, ports, industries, and other military targets in the past month. We believe we have the ability to continue this bombing, more and more fiercely, month after month, year after year, until the Nazi regime is eliminated. (Cheers) The large bombers produced by our factories and flown across the Atlantic are increasing month by month. We will continue to pour large amounts of explosives on Germany, and Italy, which is called a country but is actually a German province, will not be spared. The bombs we have dropped on Germany in the past few weeks are about half of the total number dropped by the German side on Britain since the beginning of the war, but this is just the beginning. By this time next year, everyone's strength can be increased many times over. For this reason, I ask the people to be prepared to prevent the enemy from launching fierce counterattacks as early as possible. Our methods for dealing with German night raids have been greatly improved. German aircraft no longer consider flying close to the British coast a pleasant experience. If we say that German aircraft are busy with the Soviet Union, so they have not recently made night raids on Britain, then this statement is not correct, because Germany does indeed have a powerful bomber force in Western Europe that can launch fierce attacks. I don't know why they don't come, but it must not be because they love us. The organization, diligence, and dedication of our people must be brought to the highest level. We cannot expect to hit people without being hit back. We plan to strengthen our attacks on Germany day by day, so our people should prepare themselves to reinvigorate their efforts in the London war. Even if our future is very difficult, and even if our work is very difficult, our goals will never change, because we deeply know that after this difficult period, there will be a new freedom and glory for all mankind."</p>
<h3>Soviet Authorities Deny Moving Capital</h3>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 15th – The German claim that the Soviet government and diplomatic corps are preparing to evacuate Moscow was denied by the authorities here yesterday.</p>
<h3>Spanish Blue Division Departs for Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Havas, San Sebastián, Spain, 14th – Three units of the Spanish volunteer "Blue Division," each with three thousand officers and soldiers, crossed the border today into the occupied zone of France in order to transfer to Germany to assist in the fighting.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th – The commander of the Spanish "Blue Division," General Grande, accompanied by Chief of Staff Trocoso and four officers, flew to Berlin yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sixteen German Consuls En Route to Japan</h3>
<p>Change to American Ship for Portugal</p>
<p>United Press, San Francisco, 15th – Sixteen German consuls canceled their plans to go to Japan yesterday under the orders of the German embassy in the United States. At a cost of $15,000, they chartered three American airmail planes and rushed to New York to board the American transport ship "West Point" to Lisbon.</p>
<h3>Armistice Agreement Established Between Britain and Syria</h3>
<p>Coastal Strongholds All Under British Control</p>
<p>Axis Powers' Conspiracy Against the Near East Foiled</p>
<p>Reuters, Acre, 15th – The Syrian armistice agreement was formally signed by General Wilson and General Verdillac at 7:55 PM last night. The formal signing ceremony began yesterday morning. General Catroux, leader of the Free French forces, arrived first at 10:10 AM. Half an hour later, General Wilson and Lieutenant General de Larminat also arrived. No one except senior staff officers and official war correspondents was allowed into the Smith Barracks, where the meeting was held. Of course, eavesdropping was prohibited when the military leaders of both sides conducted the actual meeting. At 11:05 AM, General Verdillac of the Vichy side and his chief of staff arrived at the Smith Barracks in a silver-gray car. The guards at the gate raised their guns in salute. The Vichy representatives also included senior naval and air force officers, and Mr. Conti, advisor to General Dentz.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – A Reuters correspondent with the Allied forces in Syria reported that now that the Syrian armistice agreement has been signed, the key military positions, airfields, and fortifications protecting the coast from Turkey to the Libyan border are all under British control. This creates a strong barrier to obstruct the Axis powers' plot against the Near East. Furthermore, the occupation of Syria, an area of 60,000 square miles, has opened up a very important gap between Palestine and Turkey. Military sources say that the Allied forces in Syria could have launched a "blitzkrieg" and resolved the war in less than two sentences. However, in order to minimize material damage and, as far as possible, not to hinder the lives of the local people, the Allied forces adopted a strategy of cutting off the Vichy forces' supply lines. Therefore, the Syrian people (mostly Arabs) hardly suffered during the war. The entry of Allied forces into Syria cannot be regarded as aggression, but only a military occupation carried out due to strategic necessity. Now Syria is no longer in isolation but has become part of the sterling area, not subject to British blockade, and has restored its position in the economy of the entire Near East.</p>
<p>Agreement Contents</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 15th – A government spokesman declared upon the official announcement of the Anglo-French armistice agreement that France has not given up Syria or Lebanon, or the League of Nations mandates. Vichy also believes that the signing of the agreement shows that Vichy has defeated the de Gaulle faction, as General Catroux and the de Gaulle faction did not participate in the negotiations. It was also stated that this final agreement is very different from the British initial ultimatum. According to the spokesman, the terms of the armistice include: (1) Cessation of fighting at 9:01 PM on July 11; (2) Allied forces occupy Syria and Lebanon, while French forces will concentrate in locations designated by a joint committee; (3) Occupation will be implemented according to procedures, so that the occupying troops can immediately replace the French forces; (4) Locations of buried landmines should be pointed out to the occupying authorities; (5) French forces should be given all kinds of military honors. French forces will withdraw to pre-designated areas with weapons but will not retain ammunition; (6) Military supplies, including coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns, will be handed over to British administration. British authorities have the right to use any military supplies they need; (7) Allied prisoners of war should be released immediately, including those who have been transferred to France; (8) French prisoners of war will be released after the occupation is completed; (9) Civil officials will remain in office when necessary for the continuation of administration until replaced by the British. After the replacement, they can return to their country at will; (10) When returning to their country, they should take French transport ships under British administration; (11) Public utilities and other public services should be handed over to the British in their original state.</p>
<h3>France Commemorates Democratic Day with Silence</h3>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 14th – Although today is National Day, in accordance with Marshal Pétain's decree, the entire country and overseas territories will commemorate it in silence and without extravagance. At the same time, churches will hold memorial services for the soldiers who died in the two European wars.</p>
<p>Reuters, Damascus, 15th – Here yesterday, in accordance with the order of the Syrian government, we celebrated the French Democratic Day with a holiday. The authorities hosted a banquet for the officers and French expatriates stationed here. General Catroux, commander-in-chief of the Free French forces and representative to Syria, met with Syrian government officials and other dignitaries.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Protects Far East Shipping, Declares "Dangerous" Areas</h3>
<p>Zones Include the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan</p>
<p>Japan Values the Route of American Military Supplies to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 15th – A Japanese government spokesman said today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received information that the Soviet Union has declared the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk as "dangerous" areas to protect navigation to Vladivostok. Iwaiichi, representative of the Cabinet Information Bureau, and Deputy Spokesman Ishii, stated at the regular press conference on Tuesday that Lieutenant General Tatekawa, the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, has received this notification. Iwaiichi said that the establishment of the "dangerous area" is to protect ships sailing to Moscow from being attacked by the Germans. However, he also said, "We believe that German ships will not be found in the Sea of Japan or around Kamchatka." He believed that "this move by the Soviet Union is an unpleasant one," because the sea surface is close to Japan. However, he said that Japan has not protested this matter. When asked if Japan intends to abide by the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, Iwaiichi replied, "The treaty still exists," refusing to comment on the future.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 15th – The Japan Times and the Kōchi Shinbun, which are considered semi-official organs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented today that Japan values the route of American aid to the Soviet Union, not the amount of materials. The newspaper said that the promise of American aid to the Soviet Union against Germany must be realized when military supplies are shipped to the Soviet Union. What transportation line will be adopted at that time is worthy of speculation by the world. The newspaper continued to say that there are about four ways for the United States to supply the Soviet Union with goods: (1) Through the Pacific Ocean, passing through the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan; (2) The Arctic Ocean; (3) The Baltic Sea; (4) The Black Sea. Among them, routes 3 and 4 are currently impossible, so there are only the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean routes. However, among them, only the route passing through the Pacific Ocean to Vladivostok is actually usable.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the Germans have asked Japan to attack the coastal provinces and Siberia behind the Soviet Union. Although Japan is very willing to take advantage of the Soviet-German war to seize the benefits of the fisherman, it is still difficult to say whether it will act in accordance with German intentions. If Japan attacks the Soviet Union, a fierce battle will inevitably occur. The Soviet Union's Far East forces have not been weakened so far. The Red Army and Air Force stationed there are well-equipped and vigilant. Moreover, this kind of offensive, which focuses on land warfare, must be commanded by army generals. Although the powerful faction in the Japanese government also wants to take action, it does not want to transfer power to the extremists among the military again. This group of people, who seem to be in power at the moment, advocate that they would rather have the navy advance south to deal with Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
<h3>New Spanish Ambassador to Germany</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 15th – It was officially announced last night that Minister of Public Security, Baron Mayat, has been appointed as the ambassador to Berlin. Mr. Ma was the founder of the Falangist Party and participated in the Spanish liberation war.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Requests Appropriations to Expand Far East Bases</h3>
<p>The Navy Department Still Advocates Fortifying Guam</p>
<p>Serving Personnel Need to Be Retained</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 15th) The U.S. government yesterday requested Congress to appropriate over 70 million dollars for the construction of Pacific naval bases. Among these, 5,570,000 is allocated for the naval air station project in Cavite (the military port of Manila), 18,605,000 for the new naval air station project at Barber's Point in Hawaii. It also requested Congress to allocate 300,000,000 dollars for coastal facilities, the main part of which includes 4,700,000 dollars each for the construction of submarine stations on Midway Island and Wake Island, 2,316,000 dollars for the construction of an ammunition depot at Oahu (Hawaii), 16,000,000 dollars for the expansion of underground oil storage at Pearl Harbor, and 6,850,000 dollars for the construction of a naval supply depot in that port.</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 15th) The executive authorities yesterday requested Congress to authorize an appropriation of over 70 million U.S. dollars for the Pacific coastal base expenditure plan from Alaska to China. It stated that the important frontier of the United States is still in the Pacific. The U.S. military requested authorization of 50,714,000 U.S. dollars for the Hawaiian area plan, of which 33,691,000 U.S. dollars is the budget for the main island of Hawaii. This total does not include the 2,975,000 U.S. dollars for the canal area under construction and the budget for some additional projects along the U.S. west coast, to demonstrate the determination to implement a massive program. The Navy Department also requested 5,000 U.S. dollars to construct a wireless radio station to replace the one currently used by the U.S. Marine Corps in Qinhuangdao, China. The Navy Department further requested authorization of 17,020,000 U.S. dollars to establish island "listening posts" around Johnston Island, Midway Island, Palmyra Island, and Wake Island in Hawaii, and 6,000,000 U.S. dollars to improve the naval air station on Samoa Island. The smaller budget request for Alaska is 9,533,000 U.S. dollars. The plan for Guam includes 170,000 U.S. dollars for living facilities at the naval station, 100,000 U.S. dollars for a naval hospital, and 60,000 U.S. dollars for staff quarters at the naval radio station, it is said.</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 15th) U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated yesterday that the Navy Department still advocates fortifying Guam. It is said that once the U.S. bases in the Pacific are built, they can cope with any emergency situation, but there are currently no plans to expand the bases. He also said that we believe Hawaii is already the strongest and most difficult-to-attack fortress in the world.</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 15th) President Roosevelt and Army Chief of Staff General Marshall told leaders of both parties in Congress at the White House yesterday that, according to intelligence gathered by the Navy and Army Departments, the United States must continue to retain enlisted army personnel for more than twelve months. Senate Majority Leader Barkley said that the Military Affairs Committees of both houses have decided to immediately begin hearings on retaining serving military personnel and lifting restrictions on sending troops outside the Western Hemisphere. However, it is understood that due to the increasing number of opponents, the government has had to temporarily abandon its plan to seek the legal authority to dispatch National Guard troops outside the Western Hemisphere. Black stated after the White House meeting that President Roosevelt had presented full (even surprising) information on the bill proposed by General Marshall. He also said that General Marshall's discussion of the situation was frank and detailed, but I cannot disclose it. The reasons he gave were very sufficient. He also said that although President Roosevelt encountered opposition from congressional leaders, he was very determined. He further stated that everything was discussed at the meeting, but we did not discuss the issue of concessions. Everyone knows what we are doing. We are just beginning to train an army, and the training is progressing. We cannot bear to destroy it immediately. When congressional leaders contradicted each other about what was said at the meeting, Leake stated that the lifting of restrictions on sending troops outside the Western Hemisphere was not discussed at the meeting, while House Speaker Rayburn said that it was mentioned at the meeting. It is believed that congressional leaders have received notice that President Roosevelt's attitude towards proceeding with this matter is very firm and may overcome congressional opposition, it is said.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 15th) After President Roosevelt conferred with congressional leaders yesterday, reliable sources say that the president and others have agreed that Congress should quickly find a way to extend the terms of conscripts and National Guard personnel beyond the original one year. A journalist heard from someone who attended the White House meeting that there would be no further consideration in the short term of the proposal to lift the ban on sending conscripts outside the Western Hemisphere, because such a proposal has encountered much opposition in Congress.</p>
<h3>Repealing the Neutrality Act to Restore Freedom of the Seas</h3>
<p>Acting Senate President Issues Statement</p>
<p>McNair Claims the U.S. is Determined to Attack the Nazis</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 15th) Democratic Senator Glass, who was recently elected Acting President of the Senate, stated that the Neutrality Act should be repealed immediately in order to restore freedom of the seas and show Hitler that we are not afraid of him at all. He also said that the repeal of this act would clear the way for American ships to transport goods to England. We are now at war and should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that our materials are safely delivered to Britain.</p>
<p>(United Press, Milwaukee, 15th) U.S. Federal Security Administrator McNair said in a speech last night that the United States is now forced to engage in an attack on Hitlerism in an attempt to prevent the Nazi way of life from encroaching on the Western Hemisphere. He also said that the United States would not launch an American four, five, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero dollar defense program to deal with the Soviet Union, even if the Soviet Union expanded its territory to within thirty miles of American territory. But if the Nazi Party ever crossed the Bering Strait, the residents of Seattle would be unable to sleep peacefully.</p>

<h3>Axis Powers Suffer Serious Blow After Anglo-Soviet Agreement</h3>
<p>Cooperation Between the Two Countries is Indeed a Wise Policy</p>
<p>Past Actions of the Soviet Union Should Be Understood</p>
<p>The "Dalu Bao" (Mainland News) newspaper commented on the Anglo-Soviet agreement on joint action in a recent article, recognizing this move by the two countries as indeed a wise policy. The translation is as follows: Britain and the Soviet Union formally concluded an agreement on Saturday and became allies. In the agreement, both parties stipulate mutual assistance and guarantee not to make peace separately. The British authorities must have undergone meticulous consideration during the negotiations, and the United States must have been informed in advance.</p>
<p>Common Interests, Sincere Cooperation</p>
<p>In the current stage of the situation, when discussing various international agreements that are easy to understand, people are generally inclined to hold ambiguous attitudes. However, in the current instance, we have no room to doubt the sincerity of both parties. Since Nazi Germany has become a deeply hated enemy of both parties, it is appropriate for the two countries to reconcile and yearn for mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Must Be Able to Comply with the Spirit of the Treaty</p>
<p>It truly shows us that the spirit of Britain and the Soviet Union in complying with treaties is superior to those of a few villainous people. The Soviet Union has annexed small countries in the Baltic Sea, as well as parts of Finland, Poland, and Romania, and has been criticized by world opinion. However, from the perspective of resisting Nazi aggression militarily, the Soviet Union has gained a better position than in its past history. The Soviet Union's position was very difficult when the European war broke out, and this needs to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Britain and the Soviet Union Form a United Front</p>
<p>When the German-Soviet Pact was signed in the past, general public opinion was skeptical. Today, regarding the conclusion of this agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, it can be hoped that this phenomenon will not occur. In the past, there was considerable suspicion between the governments of Britain and the Soviet Union, and this is an undeniable fact. However, Soviet personnel must deeply feel that the practical gains of the Anglo-Soviet agreement far exceed those of the German-Soviet Pact. It is not without effect on arousing Soviet morale, and it can give a great blow to the morale of the Nazis, as it explains to them that Britain and the Soviet Union have formed a united front. Hitler's conspiracy to weaken the unity of the two countries has now obviously failed. At the same time, this agreement can strengthen the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan, allowing it to persuade the Japanese to remain loyal to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact with sufficient reason.</p>
<p>Wise Policy to Confront the Axis</p>
<p>As generally expected, the Germans will never willingly wait for death and will certainly conspire to organize an anti-Bolshevik "Crusader" front in order to achieve their trick of disintegrating the Anglo-Soviet front. However, we firmly believe that the British government under Churchill's leadership will not be moved and will use effective methods to dispel the suspicions of the Soviets. In this rapidly changing situation, the Anglo-Soviet agreement is indeed a wise policy to strengthen the confrontation with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Urges Authorities to Be on Guard in the North</p>
<p>The Japanese "Dalu Xinbao" (Mainland News) newspaper of this city also commented on the Anglo-Soviet agreement yesterday, believing that the Soviet Union will not be incited by Britain and the United States to take sudden action, and that Britain and the United States may exert pressure on Japan through the Soviet Union. Therefore, the newspaper warned the Japanese authorities not to neglect their guard in the north. After signing the Anglo-Soviet agreement, the Soviet side expressed its willingness to adhere to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact unswervingly. The newspaper expressed its trust in this point, but expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, as such agreements are the same as those signed by Britain and France and Britain and Poland, and have very little practical significance.</p>
<h3>Telephone Workers' Strike Resolved Through Efforts of the Political Department</h3>
<p>Electrical Workers Resume Work Today</p>
<p>Wages During the Strike Period Calculated at Fifty-Five Hours</p>
<p>The 1,700 workers of the electrical telephone department of the Shanghai Telephone Company have successively made requests to the company for wage increases and improved treatment due to the pressure of livelihood. More than 700 workers in the electrical department began to implement a go-slow strike on the 3rd of this month, which has lasted for more than ten days.</p>
<p>Strict Guard at Various Branches</p>
<p>About 1,000 telephone workers also intended to implement a go-slow strike from 8 a.m. the day before yesterday in response to the workers in the electrical department. Fortunately, the police authorities were informed in advance and dispatched a large number of armed detectives to strictly guard the entrances of the company's eight branch management offices on Mett Herst Road, Jiangxi Road, Fujian Road, Huishan Road, Bixun Road, Haining Road, Lusheng Road, and Balibridge Road, instructing the telephone workers gathered at the entrances of each office to enter and work. The workers all entered the company as usual.</p>
<p>Political Department Has Impartially Mediated</p>
<p>The Political Department of the Public Concession, considering that telephones are one of the public utilities, and that if the dispute were to expand, it would have a great impact on social order, immediately devised ways to conduct impartial mediation. After sending personnel to speak with both labor and management of the company once the day before yesterday, both parties expressed their acceptance of the authorities' mediation. In order to resolve the matter as soon as possible, the Political Department specially convened representatives of both labor and management at 2 p.m. yesterday to conduct impartial mediation. Management sent acting manager F. W. Phillips as its representative, while labor sent Wu Changfu, Xu Deliang, Tang Woyu, Cao Huizhong, and Huang Shufang as its representatives. Pan Lianbi and Gao Yangen of the Political Department mediated. As a result of the negotiations: (1) All electrical workers will resume work tomorrow (today); (2) The dismissed workers Chuan Hao and Xu Deliang will still be allowed to resume work; (3) Wages, allowances, and rice subsidies for the strike period will be calculated at fifty-five hours; (4) In the future, management shall not dismiss workers without good reason. Other details will be negotiated at a later date. Therefore, the labor unrest has been resolved, and all workers are to return to work at the company today.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds First Principal Repayment</h3>
<p>In order to encourage the people to concentrate financial resources for national salvation expenses, the National Government issued the National Salvation Bonds of the Republic of China in 1937, with a national currency value of 500 million yuan. The National Defense Supreme Council has approved the repayment of principal starting from August 31 of this year, to be fully repaid in thirty years, together with the fourth interest payment due. The Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications will handle the payments. The Ministry of Finance has allocated the required principal and interest from the national treasury revenue and deposited it into a special account at the Central Bank for payment. However, according to reporters from the Xin Sheng She (New Voice News Agency) who inquired with the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications yesterday, due to environmental circumstances, the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will temporarily not handle this payment. All bondholders can entrust banks to collect from the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Hong Kong and various domestic locations. It is said that the full amount will be paid in cash at once, and not in installments.</p>
<h3>"Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund Committee Member Candidates Confirmed</h3>
<p>To Be Undertaken by Shen Siliang, Chen Qingshi, etc.</p>
<p>Donations from All Walks of Life Became More Enthusiastic Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund received over 500 yuan in donations, and the opinions expressed in the letters from the donating gentlemen were sincere and enthusiastic, which was very moving. The committee in charge of the scholarship fund has been jointly organized by four celebrities from the education sector and representatives from this newspaper. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Readers' Donations Become More Enthusiastic</p>
<p>Those who generously donated to the scholarship fund yesterday were Kangji, a deposit book with the Central Asia Bank totaling 204 yuan; Mr. Tang Yiren, 100 yuan; Ms. Tang Wang Huizhen, 100 yuan; Mr. Chuan Jingyu, 40 yuan; Mr. Zhang Jun, 20 yuan; Mr. Pang Xingcun, 20 yuan; Yuye Amateur Advancement Association, 10 yuan; Mr. Yu Shentang, 10 yuan; Ms. Ying Qin Shuluan, 1 yuan; Ying Chun Gao and Chun Tong together, 1 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 526 yuan was received, which, together with the amount received in the previous three days excluding monthly donations, totaled 2,116 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Women and Children Promote It Together</p>
<p>Ms. Qin hopes that women in the city will save a portion of their makeup and entertainment expenses and donate it to the scholarship fund to reduce youth dropping out of school and create useful talents. The Ying brothers hope that children in the city will save their candy money and donate it to the scholarship fund, which will not only help poor and disaster-stricken children but also benefit their health. Why not do it?</p>
<p>Hotel Waiter Sends Monthly Donations</p>
<p>Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, sent in his monthly donation of 20 yuan for July yesterday and set the 5th of each month as the date for sending the monthly donation. He also said that the hotel industry has no fixed income and can only accumulate little by little to make donations. His intention is very commendable.</p>
<p>Specialized Teachers Strive to Assist</p>
<p>Lu Boya of Wuxi National Studies College expressed his extreme willingness to assist in this matter, but since he is a salaried employee, a one-time donation is beyond his means. He intends to donate 5 yuan of his salary monthly starting next month. Teachers are the most impoverished profession, and their monthly income is limited, and their lives are already difficult. Mr. Lu extends this consideration to others, which makes his colleagues feel infinitely grateful.</p>
<p>All Proceeds from Manuscripts Used to Help Students</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Guoying is willing to donate the remuneration he received last month for writing for the arts and entertainment section of this newspaper to the scholarship fund, saying that although the amount is small, it is enough to express my heart. He hopes that people in Shanghai can be like Mr. Lu and Mr. Wang. The accumulation of a large sum for the scholarship fund is not difficult.</p>
<p>Leaders in the Academic Community Generously Agree to Preside</p>
<p>Reporters yesterday briefly introduced the situation of the scholarship fund being handled in seven groups and the invitation of celebrities to preside over it. This newspaper then separately sought their consent yesterday. These include Mr. Shen Siliang, President of St. John's University; Mr. Chen Qingshi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council; Ms. Nie Lingyu, Principal of the Municipal Council Girls' School; and Mr. Lu Gaoyi, General Manager of the World Book Company. This newspaper nominated Mr. Zhao Zongyu as its representative. We are extremely fortunate that these gentlemen have generously agreed to serve as members of the scholarship fund committee and preside over everything.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ship "Naruto Maru" Sailed to Ningbo with Passengers Last Night</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship "Naruto Maru" runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Because the Japanese naval authorities did not issue a long-term navigation certificate, the ship has been running for two months, and the schedule has not yet been determined. On the 30th of last month, it returned to Shanghai from Ningbo and docked at the Laobaibo Wharf in Pudong. It was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo again on the 4th of this month, but unexpectedly, it was temporarily blocked by the Japanese Navy. Exports were suspended on that day, and it was moved to mooring buoys 26 and 27 on the 10th, waiting for the navigation certificate from the Japanese naval authorities. It was finally issued yesterday, and the ship sailed to Ningbo at around 7 p.m. yesterday. It is reported that there were about seventy or eighty passengers, and cargo was not allowed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cargo Ship Sinks off Daikai Island</h3>
<p>Met Big Storm During Voyage and Cannot be Saved</p>
<p>Crew Was Rescued By Myoko Maru and Has Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>At 3 a.m. on the 12th of this month, a cargo ship (shipowner Soichiro Matsumura) of the Japanese Toyo Asia Marine Transport Company, sailing between Moji and Shanghai, encountered a big storm 30 miles southwest of Daikai Island, and the situation was extremely critical. At that time, the Japanese ship Myoko Maru happened to be passing by the area. The crew of the ship reported to the captain, who saw through a telescope that the cargo ship was on the verge of desperation, so he immediately went to assist and took the six crew members of the ship to Myoko Maru. As for the cargo ship, it was impossible to rescue it due to the excessive storm, so it was allowed to sink. Myoko Maru arrived outside the Wusong Estuary on the 13th and then sailed into the Huangpu River and docked at the Pudong Wharf. The cargo ship's captain, Matsumura, went to the Japanese Consulate General to report the incident. All the rescued crew members are currently residing temporarily in the Jiangnan Hotel on Minhang Road.</p>
<h3>Englishman Returns to Shanghai and Talks About the Recent Situation in Qingdao</h3>
<p>An Englishman from this city, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao a few days ago, talked about the recent situation in Qingdao. According to him, oranges and sugar are difficult to buy in Qingdao, and the food situation there is similar to that in Shanghai. Qingdao is currently like a barracks, and traces of the Japanese army can be found everywhere on the streets. The sound of daily morning drills can be heard incessantly, disturbing people's dreams. The shops opened by the Japanese in the area are everywhere, and most of the vendors in the market are also Japanese. Although there are various news reports from the Japanese side, foreigners in Qingdao do not believe them and rush to listen to the accurate news broadcasts by Shanghai news reporter Alcott every evening.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Strictly Orders the Suppression of Shanghai Merchants Stockpiling Grain</h3>
<p>300,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai Within Half a Month</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly suppress grain prices, effectively suppress hoarding, and guarantee the legitimate operation of legitimate merchants, the National Government has repeatedly promulgated measures to suppress prices, and Chairman Chiang also issued a handwritten order to the Ministry of Social Affairs, the National Food Administration, the Fair Price Purchase and Sale Office, and other agencies, requiring them to strictly comply with these measures in order to gradually reduce prices in various places and relieve the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>Grain Prices in Various Places</p>
<p>Since the highest standing committee and the chairman have strictly rectified and maintained legitimate business, it has gradually returned to the right track. Reporters from the Xin Sheng She (New Voice News Agency) learned from relevant parties in this city yesterday that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Food Administration have promulgated and implemented the method of suppressing the hoarding of important daily necessities during special periods according to government orders. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of this method, various items for which hoarding is suppressed should be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the suppression area and notified to the competent government offices to jointly implement the suppression matters. If a special management agency is established, the original agency will continue to preside over the handling. It has been learned that the areas for suppressing the hoarding of various food items have been discussed and decided by the ministry bureau and sent to various places for investigation and handling after checking the suppression of various food items.</p>
<p>List of Suppression Area Names</p>
<p>The following is a list of the restricted areas for various types of food items:</p>
<p>(1) Rice: all provinces and cities across the country; (2) Millet: all provinces and cities across the country; (3) Wheat: all provinces and cities across the country; (4) Flour: major cities in various provinces; (5) Sorghum: Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces; (6) Corn: Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and other provinces; (7) Beans: major cities in various provinces. It is learned that no merchant in this city may hoard any grain items such as rice, millet, wheat flour, and beans, otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law. It was learned yesterday that the Municipal Council's</p>
<p>Second Batch of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The total number transported to Shanghai has reached more than 100,000 bags. Various grocery and grain stores that had ordered from the authorities and transported them to Shanghai in succession also reached about 50,000 bags. The total number of foreign rice ordered from foreign producing areas by other rice stores and transported to Shanghai in the middle of this month has also reached about 150,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of foreign rice transported to Shanghai in half a month has reached 300,000 bags. Therefore, the rice and grain reserves in this city are exceptionally abundant. As for foreign sales, they have suddenly decreased due to transportation difficulties. Because most of the rice sold by rice shops in this city is Municipal Council foreign rice and is directly ordered from the Lichiji Foreign Firm, the sales volume on the market has greatly decreased, and rice prices have fallen in succession.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldier Shot in Pudong: Japanese Military Imposes Martial Law and Searches</h3>
<p>The soldier sustained two bullet wounds, but his injuries are not serious.</p>
<p>The assailant left behind a straw hat, which is being used for investigation.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 14th) at 5 PM, three gunshots suddenly rang out on Lai Yi Ferry Police Station Road in Pudong. At the time, there were no pedestrians on the road. A Japanese military police squad leader was wounded and fell to the ground, but was still able to speak. The Japanese military police team at Pudong Hospital (200 meters from the scene) learned of the incident and went to inquire. The squad leader, named Nakanohata Katsuketsu, was visiting a friend from Gao Miao Qingning Temple. He was shot and assassinated from behind by a young man wearing yellow trousers and sneakers, who fled to the north, leaving behind a straw hat. The injured man was sent to the Yangshupu Army Hospital for treatment. He sustained one gunshot wound each to the chest, side, and leg, but his injuries are not serious.</p>

A large crowd of pedestrians gathered on both sides of the pier. Motor vehicles patrolled back and forth on Dongchang Road, creating a tense situation. Residents in the Jingju Road area where the incident occurred were taken to the Japanese military police team by truck for investigation, reportedly more than 300 people. Residents in various locations, including Wu Family Lane and Yang Family Residence, were summoned and searched house by house. However, no evidence was found. Martial law was lifted at 10:15 PM, after five hours, and pedestrians were allowed to move freely again.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the area was reopened as usual. However, after vegetable vendors crossed the river to Pudong, martial law was declared again at 7 AM, and the straw hat left by the assailant was taken to various neighborhoods to search for the culprit. Anyone with suspicious features had the straw hat placed on their head. If the size matched, they were taken in for interrogation. Traffic was restored at 11:15 AM when martial law was lifted. All the innocent residents, two to three hundred people, who had been detained were released in succession until 5 PM.

<h3>Epidemic Spreads: Increase in Corpses on the Streets</h3>
<p>Due to the hot weather and the spread of seasonal illnesses, poor people sleeping on the streets easily become ill due to exposure to heat and cold. As a result, the number of corpses found on the streets has increased sharply. According to a recent report from Tongren Fuyun Hall, a total of 1,229 corpses were collected in June. The above statistics only refer to the area within the French Concession. The number of deaths in the Public Concession and the city is not included.</p>

<h3>Countless Deceptive Tricks: Impersonating a Doctor to Collect Money</h3>
<p>How Can Incense Ash and Yellow Talismans Cure Diseases?</p>
<p>Foolish Men and Women are Easily Deceived</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangfa, also known as Hu Kun, a native of Henan, is currently sixty years old. He was previously reported to the authorities for impersonating a doctor and deceiving patients. Zhang was sent to Special Court No. 1 and sentenced to eight months in prison. However, after Zhang was released upon completion of his sentence, he did not repent. He changed his name to Luo Xibai, also known as Old Man Xibai, and practiced medicine at No. 23 Dengxian Lane, No. 334 Baker Road. He also published advertisements in the newspapers, promoting himself as</p>
<p>someone who uses Buddhist methods to treat illnesses, specializing in treating all kinds of difficult and complicated diseases. A local woman, Gu Zhang, who lives at No. 57 Dexing Lane, Connaught Road (currently 26 years old), has been suffering from a severe stomach ailment recently. She saw a report that Old Man Xibai could cure all diseases, so she went to seek treatment on the 6th of this month and paid a registration fee of one yuan and forty cents. Old Man Xibai gave her a packet of incense ash and instructed her to take it home and boil it with three red dates and a little brown sugar, taking two doses a day, which would be effective. If she came to see him again for another dose, he would be able to cure her completely. On the 8th, she went again because it had not been effective. The old man led her into a small room and said that he needed to use Buddhist surgery, and that she needed to</p>
<p>burn fifteen scriptures every day, each costing one yuan, for seven consecutive days, totaling one hundred and five yuan, in order to recover completely. Because she did not have this large sum of money at the time, she requested a reduction. They finally agreed on eighty yuan, and she paid a deposit of twenty yuan first. The old man then drew a talisman on yellow paper with a red pen, burned it with fire, circled it around her abdomen several times, and then pierced the wall with a pedicure knife, asking her if it hurt. She replied that it hurt a little. Later, she discovered that there was a red mark the size of a soybean on the skin of her abdomen, but the illness did not improve after several days. She then realized that the old man was falsely claiming to treat illness,</p>
<p>defrauding her of money. According to information, Detective Tang Jian, Deputy Detective Ding Huaguo, and Detective Xu Zhengting of the New Gate Police Station instructed the woman to take the marked legal tender of sixty yuan to Luo Xibai, and also gave her ten packets of incense ash. The detectives then arrested Luo and confiscated 550 yuan of legal tender, along with the accountant, Fu Maolin, a native of Ningbo, and the tea server, Zhu Tianyi, a native of Suzhou, as well as various deceptive Buddhist practices, letters, and papers. They were all taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of Special Court No. 1. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the above situation and charged them with the crime of defrauding money</p>
<p>formally.</p>
<p>He said that the defendants falsely claimed to treat illnesses using Buddhist methods, deceiving patients of their money. The police had received three anonymous letters of accusation and requested an extension of the deadline. According to Gu Zhang's complaint of being defrauded, Judge Zhong questioned the defendants briefly and ordered that the tea server, Zhu Tianyi, be released on bail of 500 yuan. Luo and Fu were detained and their case was postponed for further investigation.</p>
<p>Zhong Qing Drama Troupe to Perform Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Zhong____ group in this city, an amateur drama troupe organized by people in academic circles, has been established for several months now. It is now known that the troupe has decided to hold its first performance at the Russian Theatre on the 17th of this month in order to raise educational loans and increase the acting experience of its members. The play is the famous Russian work "Love and Hate." The play has been meticulously rehearsed by director Xia Feng for a long time, and the performance is expected to be perfect. In order to reward the audience, a commemorative special issue and a commemorative fan, both exceptionally exquisite, have been printed and will be distributed to the audience.</p>

<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's 9:30 AM listing saw British Parity US dollar already raised by 0.0625 to 5.1875 yuan. Japanese, Dutch, and Luxemburgish exchange rates also rose. French and German exchanges were inactive. The rest remained unchanged. The dark market for British-American exchange rates was slightly weaker in the speculative flurry after opening in the morning. After 10:30 AM, the Japanese bank started to spew out again. Chinese banks such as China Banking Corporation and Continental Bank also supplied currency, leading to the US exchange rate returning to 5.3125 yuan, which was manageable. However, foreign banks' selling price remained 5.28125 yuan, hence the return to parity at noon. The beginning of the afternoon was extremely stable. Fifteen minutes before the end, the Netherlands suddenly spewed out more currency, and British banks such as HSBC also sold, causing the US dollar to return to parity with the previous day's price of 5.3125 yuan. The British exchange rate, however, tightened by 0.015625, calculated at three-point-two-three-four-three-seven-five. Trading was extremely active throughout the day. It is said that a Chinese bank sold 50,000 Hong Kong dollars to a Chinese merchant at the price of 21.625 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold Listing Raised</p>
<p>From the morning, the telegraphic silver market saw both British and Indian currency rates rise, the American market remained unchanged. Exchange rates in various countries saw British vs. Shanghai increase by 0.03125, American vs. Shanghai increase by 5 fen, the rest remained the same. Central listings of various exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening of the domestic market, the bank selling price for spot British exchange was three-point-two-five, and for US dollars, it was 5.3125 yuan. Chinese merchants and speculators actively bought the July-August US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, and were immediately difficult to conclude deals. The market momentum was slightly tight, weakening to 5.28125 yuan, and the trend seemed stable for a long time. HSBC's listings saw British Parity rise with American, and the silver rate increased by 25, calculated as a slight 23.25%, still little change. Around 10:30 AM, the Japanese bank suddenly came to sell current US dollars again at 5.3125 yuan, and the foreign banks' intention to accept the offer faded. Chinese banks such as China Banking Corporation and Continental Bank also came to sell August contracts at 5.3125 yuan to speculators, but the foreign banks were unwilling to settle at the above price. Hence, the noon closing was still at 5.28125 yuan, and the British exchange rate also tightened to three-point-two-three-four-three-seven-five.</p>
<p>HSBC Netherlands Return to Selling</p>
<p>In the early afternoon, there was little trading, and the market was stagnant. The speculative wind of short-selling had subsided, and the Japanese bank had also stopped selling. Until 3:20 PM, the Netherlands suddenly spewed out August US dollars at 5.3125 yuan, followed by British banks such as HSBC selling at the same price. The market momentum suddenly changed. At the 3:30 PM closing, spot and August contracts were both at British exchange three-point-two-three-four-three-seven-five, and US dollars at 5.3125 yuan, which was tighter by 0.015625 compared to the previous day's closing. The US dollar was neutralized.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Firm</h3>
<p>The red-hot dark market for gold yesterday saw small fluctuations, and the market momentum was firm. This was due to the tightening of foreign exchange and repeated buying from the Shanghai west gangs. However, there were negative rumors, such as the impending southward advance of Japan. Hence, although the price rebounded, it circled in the middle of the trading. After opening in the morning, gold shops initially sold, then followed by Yuan Yi, Decheng, Hengji, and Xianghe, who started absorbing the supply. Foreign exchange tightened, so the price rose from 6,530 yuan. In the afternoon, Tianyuan, Xiangxingyong, and Dafeng competed to enter the market, raising the price to 6,570 yuan. Li Tai sold aggressively. The market price had already started to rebound when suddenly it was heard that HSBC had again sold US exchange and that securities firms were selling. The market was small, with a surplus of only a few yuan, and finally saw an increase of 19 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 70,000-80,000 taels. The swap rate (July to August) was discounted by the sellers to the buyers, 57-58 yuan in the morning and 56-57 yuan in the afternoon. Trading was quite active. The morning price for cash contracts was 370 yuan higher than the futures contracts, and in the afternoon, Xinyuan sold 30 taels to Xianghe, 355 yuan higher. Finally, the price had to be 360 yuan higher, a 10 yuan increase. Ornamental gold was listed at 5 yuan, calculated at 715 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Rose 19 Yuan</p>
<p>Since every bar (ten taels) in the morning was difficult to settle at US dollar 5.3125 for the August contract, morale was boosted. The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,540 yuan, 14 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. It started low at 45 yuan. Hesheng and Deda came to sell, dropping back to 6,535 yuan. It was seen that Decheng, Hengji, Yi Yuan, Cheng Ji, and Xianghe repeatedly absorbed the supply, and the Shanghai west gangs constantly covered their short positions. The price stepped upwards. Around 10 o'clock, the price rose to 6,567 yuan, which was sold by gold shops and money changers. It was seen that the price fell back. When it was heard that the Japanese bank was again plugging in US dollars and the rumor of Japan's southward advance resurfaced, Shun Yuan, Cheng Ji, Xinfeng Yong, and Dafeng spewed out their contracts, dropping back more than 20 yuan to 6,540 yuan. Yi Yuan, Da Yan, and Chi Da bought. The price rose again at noon. The noon closing was 6,557 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM at 6,555 yuan, decided by dropping from 58 yuan to 53 yuan. Tianyuan, Dafeng, and Xiangxingyong came to buy, and the price was immediately raised to 6,570 yuan. Li Tai sold, calculated that the price fluctuated greatly around 6,560 yuan. Until the US dollar exchange rate loosened at 3:15 PM, Yi Da, Defu, Yi Yuan, and Shun Yuan raced to aggressively sell, and the price stepped down a surplus of yuan, dropping to 6,542 yuan. Xinfengyong bought. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,545 yuan, rising 19 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, calculated by settling the August US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, a press of 10 yuan. The closing after trading was 6,542 yuan. There was a difference of 35 yuan high and low throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold of the current brand was 380 yuan higher than the futures contracts, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. The current price of marker gold remained without price or market.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Listed Higher by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops, Datong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, initially listed at 710 yuan, rose 5 yuan at 10:45 AM to 715 yuan, with a decrease of 40 yuan when buying, it is said.</p>
<h3>American Notes Dominate</h3>
<p>Swap Relationship... Short Accounts Rush to Cover</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both spot and futures prices rise. British and American gold pounds also rose one yuan, and British gold notes rebounded 5 jiao. American gold notes opened at 18.87 yuan. After opening, Rentai Yong sold short, and Dachang, Lianhe, Bao Xiang, etc. aggressively bought, raising the price to 19.01 yuan. Yintai, Zhihe, Dongsheng Heng, Zhicheng, etc. sold, dropping back to 18.9 jiao. The noon closing was 9.8 jiao. The afternoon closing was 18.97 yuan, rising 1.1 jiao compared to the previous day. This was because of the swap relationship and the short accounts rushing to cover, hence although the outside had not changed much, the American notes were able to dominate. Hong Kong notes trended stable and the market price was flat. Japanese gold notes rose slightly by 1 fen. The evening market rose to yuan and 2.5 fen. Korean notes trended stable and the market price was flat. The evening market still remained at 1.61 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Rose Sharply</h3>
<p>Tong Bing Again Broke Out of Two Yuan</p>
<p>After the drop the day before, the dark market for public bonds saw another sharp rise yesterday. Ding bond almost rose one yuan, bought by Xinfu, Lemao, Hongda, etc. for more than 1 million. Zhong Bing bond broke out of two yuan again. However, those who took advantage of the high price to get out were able to sell at good prices. The long side saw A go to B and B go to C. The cycle generated and transferred to each other. It is not yet known who will win. When the long side's lines of defense cannot be unified, they will ultimately be unable to break out of the circling situation. There was no excitement in the morning trading. The buying side did not have much strength. Xin Chang, Xie Kang, Rund, and Runli did not have much capacity. Ding Kang and Yi Tai supplied a lot, all of whom were getting out. Shun Tai also sold a considerable amount. The noon closing market price was slightly higher by 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, Xinfu entered the A and C bond market for 400,000, Lemao entered C and Ding market for 300,000, and Hongda also entered Ding for 400,000. Shengda Jiucheng, etc. also bought 100,000-200,000. Ding Kang and Yi Tai sold out again. The market price broke out of two yuan. Zhongfu exited long positions. The 14th and Tongshun all sold out. Lianhe also supplied 300,000. The closing market price was firmer. The market price results were consistent, rebounding 5.5-9.5 jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the securities exchange stock were traded at a price of 36 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stock market of Zhongye Public Office was stable and lively, with prices consistently rising. Xiangtai stock saw again the high price of the previous day, closing at 67 yuan. Trading in all well-known stocks was brisk. British Union stock was outstanding, circling between 29.75 yuan and 32 yuan throughout the day, and closed at the latter price.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Monday) - The listing market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant companies' stocks today remained flat and stagnant. Only the stock of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China rose 1 shilling and 3 pence to £8 18s 9d. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Although Customer Sales are Sluggish, Yarn Prices Still Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned upwards, but actual trading remained sluggish. However, industry players mostly viewed it favorably, and the news of the Shenxin Cotton Mill from the previous day was purely false. Therefore, the long side's morale rebounded, and there were quite a few buyers. However, those outside the industry continued to short sell. Therefore, the long and short sides fiercely competed. 20-count Double Horse high price was 1,592 yuan, and the low price was 1,573 yuan. The initial trading in the afternoon was 1,580-something yuan, then it rose to 1,596 yuan. The final price was 1,591-92 yuan. The yarn market is now rebounding after a sharp rise, and it is possible that it will circle for a while due to the stagnation of customer sales. Today, 160 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 410 bales were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with a strong momentum, and the buyers were all insiders. The first price was 1,573 yuan. There were many buyers at this price. Shortly after, it rose to 1,575 yuan, and then straight to 1,584-85 yuan. This price circled for quite a long time. Because the sales yard was stagnant, morale was ordinary. However, the platforms were tight. The amount absorbed by the long side was not released. At 11:30 AM, it rose to 1,592 yuan. Unexpectedly, the closing price of the exchange suddenly fell by more than 10 yuan to 20 yuan, and Double Horse fell by 10 yuan, dropping to 1,579 yuan. The closing price rebounded slightly to 1,584 yuan. The half-day trading volume was 5,110 bales. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 110, Tong Hang 5,000, totaling 5,110.</p>
<p>The situation of the Double Horse futures yarn market. The market opened firmly in the early morning because the price of foreign cotton rebounded sharply, and the exchange market and the price of gold were both good. Therefore, there were many new purchases and short covering, and each of the July and August contracts rose by 7.5 yuan to 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The September contract rose 14 yuan. The buyers were even more active after opening. The July contract rose to 1,441 yuan, the August contract to 1,460 yuan, and the September contract to 1,530 yuan. After entering the market, the customer sales were still too sluggish, and the long side engaged in profitable resales, so the price loosened from the high. The noon closing saw the July and August contracts still rise by 6 yuan, and the September contract rise by 8 yuan. 10,280 bales were traded. The trading in the latter market decreased slightly. The market momentum was firm in the near term and flat in the long term. As a result, the July contract rose 12 yuan compared to the previous day, the August contract rose 8.5 yuan, and the September contract rose 7 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 16,240 bales, a decrease of 7,930 bales compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the entire day are recorded on the left (the prices are net trade prices).</p>
<h3>Transaction in Coarse Velvet Seen Only Busier</h3>
<p>The current cotton market situation is slightly calm. This is because after the yarn market rebounded, factory demand was relatively sluggish, so morale was slightly flat. However, coarse velvet and cotton are unusually scarce and expensive, and the trend is still tight. Because foreign cotton has not loosened, those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them cheaply, and most are taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is lively, firm, and expensive. Due to excessive rainfall and unfavorable cotton production, the public's desire to buy is strong. The closing price yesterday rose by 14 to 19 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to active short covering, then fell back due to exporters selling in Europe. The market situation finally rose again due to continuous purchases by Japanese merchants. As a result, the closing price rose by approximately 3 rupees each.</p>
<p>It is predicted that the market will open today with an increase of 2.75 rupees.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is firm and expensive, and the trading is enthusiastic. Because the prices of American and Indian cotton have risen repeatedly, and at the same time, the stocks in Shanghai are not large, the public's desire to buy is strong. In recent days, both the cotton merchants and foreign merchants have made large deals in Brazilian cotton.</p>
<h3>Textiles  Textile Trial Shipment to Ou</h3>
<p>Shipping 1,500 Pieces to Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fluctuated, and sentiment was lackluster. However, there was strong demand from both the southern route and local streets. There were reports of a trial shipment by the Wenzhou group in the coming days. However, the initial shipment only contains existing stock, and new stock replenishment will have to wait. Prices for white cloth, both coarse and fine, as well as twill, remained consistently firm. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth for high-quality goods increased by about 50 cents. Lower quality remained steady. Local street transactions totaled over 500 pieces of various cloths. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian groups purchased two to three hundred pieces of coarse and fine cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. Northern route, Yantai, and other groups purchased over one hundred pieces of futures velvet and other goods. On the 16th, 835 pieces of textiles were shipped to Hong Kong, another 55 pieces were shipped to Singapore, and another 635 pieces were shipped to Siam (Thailand).</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Prices initially rose, then fell, eventually settling at a steady level. The leading white cloth, fine cloth from the factory, initially rose to 49.80 yuan in the morning. However, due to sluggish trading, the afternoon closing price returned to 49.20 yuan, showing no change from the previous day's price. Fine twill saw a slight price increase due to the new tax. The forward market price for Blue Double Fish brand opened at 43.45 yuan. Colored goods, serge, peaked at 1.62375 yuan but closed lower at 1.61375 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>Grains  Imported Rice Market Small</h3>
<p>Yesterday, imported rice saw a further price decline of one to two yuan. This was due to continuous heavy arrivals, leading to thicker inventories. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Council had recently received 40,000 to 50,000 bags of imported rice after its previous small shipment was sold out, all of which had arrived and were awaiting sale. Demand from the ironworks was limited, and the market already showed signs of oversupply. As foreign merchants continued to offer their rice for sale, wholesale merchants dared not purchase freely. Therefore, both spot and futures rice prices fell uniformly after the market opened. Although the small price decrease in the central market attracted purchases from inland merchants and speculators, leading to an apparent rebound, the continued selling by speculators and small retail holders ultimately resulted in a weak market, with closing prices lower by one to two yuan compared to the previous day. Spot price for Yinghua small package rice once reached 147 yuan, while futures ranged from 151.20 yuan to 150.05 yuan. Second-grade Siamese rice ranged from 142.80 yuan to 142 yuan. Spot price for broken rice was as low as 108 yuan, while futures ranged from 111 to 112 yuan. Total transactions amounted to seven to eight hundred tons. Spot rice also decreased by one to two yuan. First-grade Saigon rice dropped from 130 yuan to 127 yuan, second-grade from 122 yuan, small package rice from 123 yuan to 121.50 yuan, then to 120 yuan, broken rice from 95.50 yuan, then to 89 yuan, 砑米 from 113 yuan, then to 108 yuan. Total daily transactions were 15,000 to 16,000 bags.</p>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's "Taiyuan" steamer arrived yesterday evening (the 14th) from Hong Kong, carrying 10,000 bags of imported rice, which were the Shanghai Municipal Council's price-controlled rice. The ship is currently docked at Pudong and is scheduled to move to the company's wharf in the French Concession tomorrow morning for unloading.</p>
<p>Thick Japonica Rice: Continued limited arrivals led to sluggish sales. With the sellers' insistence, the market勉定, continuing at 142.5 yuan for fresh early and late rice from Nangang, declining to 139 yuan. Original packages of white Japonica rice from Wuxi were 135 yuan, and old Japonica rice was 132-133 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: Although the domestic glutinous rice source has become increasingly scarce due to seasonal factors, scattered demand exists for necessary applications, leading to continued fluctuations. Prices ranged from a high of 127 yuan, then down to 125 yuan. However, Hong Kong white glutinous rice was affected by imported rice and the poor performance of local glutinous rice processing, resulting in sluggish digestion of inventory. This prevented sellers from pushing prices higher, leading to a soft market. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 124 yuan, then declined to 120 yuan. Glutinous green beans did not open.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Unsettled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw weak trading due to a lack of sustained sales to customers and limited absorption by 木街. Moreover, the market was affected by the continued decline in rice prices. Holders were willing to sell according to market prices. Golden Dragon flour initially opened at just 32.10 yuan but quickly rebounded to 32.45 yuan and 32.35 yuan, with a closing price of 32.30 yuan. Fort powder opened at 33 yuan to 33.10 yuan. Australian flour of the Flower Bird brand was priced at 33.70 yuan (including weight allowance). Other miscellaneous brands were also directly distributed to local streets in small quantities. Total transactions amounted to over 10,000 bags. The market remains small. Supply and demand for wheat remained quiet, with no real market activity.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes  Speculation Remains Rampant</h3>
<p>Bean Exports are Considerable</p>
<p>Edible Oil: The bullish trend continued, driven by persistently limited supply. Holders became increasingly determined to hoard, and speculators took the opportunity to become highly active, pushing prices up by another three to five yuan. General market transactions included 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 40 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 20 barrels of soybean oil, 60 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, 200 barrels of Pudong soybean oil, 100担 of Dayou factory soybean oil, and over 3,000 担 of clear oil (prices detailed in the market price section).</p>
<p>Oilseed Cakes: Yesterday, the market trend remained firm due to continued purchases by large clients such as yarn and flower merchants. Additionally, the Southeast Asian group's offloading activity has increased, boosting confidence. Prices rose by another 20 to 30 cents compared to the previous day. Transactions included 1,000 pieces of Dayou soybean cake and 6,000 pieces of Shengji soybean cake (spot) and 20,000 pieces (futures).</p>
<p>On the 16th, exports included 700 bags of soybeans to Xiamen, 2,847 bags to Hong Kong, 2,888 bags to Singapore, 1,240 pieces of oilseed cake to Hong Kong, 1,000 pieces to Singapore, and 2,000 pieces to Siam (Thailand).</p>
<h3>Coal  Coal Briquettes Loosening Openly and Secretly</h3>
<p>—One Yuan Cheaper per Dan—</p>
<p>The price of coal briquettes has been stagnant for the past month, leading to open and secret loosening. Recently, a price cut by a certain factory triggered a response from other factories, leading to widespread price reductions. The open and secret prices have now converged. Yitai Hing, Nanyang, Guohua, and other companies' own vehicles are priced at 296 yuan per ton. Goods from smaller factories are 4-5 yuan cheaper. Retail prices at doorfront shops have also been reduced from 17 yuan to 16 yuan per 担, a reduction of one yuan. However, most coal briquettes on the market were already being sold at 16 yuan.</p>

It is said that the book's content is based on Dr. Xu Xianji's original Medical Encyclopedia of Skin and Urinary Diseases, taking its essence and understanding its mysteries. At the same time, it references famous English and German works for further compilation, and describes the history of skin diseases, the anatomy and physiology of the skin, and general pathology, general causes, and general diagnosis in chapters.

<h3>Launching the "Shen Bao Readers Scholarship" Campaign</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The fundraising campaign for the *Shen Bao* Readers Scholarship has been launched for only three or four days, and has already garnered widespread sympathy from society. We are deeply moved by the enthusiastic donations and encouraging letters from readers!</p>
<p>The most noteworthy event is a letter from Mr. Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, offering to save 20 yuan each month to cover the food and tuition of disaster-stricken children until his job is terminated. We are truly grateful for Mr. Shen's enthusiastic support with his hard-earned money. The fundraising of scholarships is originally a very meaningful cultural movement, which depends not only on one or two powerful people, but also on the support of a broad social stratum, so that it can develop and last forever. Mr. Shen's promotion will undoubtedly inspire future generations to rise up.</p>
<p>In such a time and environment, economic life has been weighing on people for a long time, let alone spiritual life. Students who have gone through countless hardships, traveled thousands of miles, those whose relatives have become starving victims on the road, those who have no relatives to turn to, those who are wandering the streets eating weeds, but their hearts are still strong, and their goals and desire for knowledge have not been lost in the upheaval. They need bread, and even more spiritual food! All kinds of living expenses are soaring with the pockets of a few speculators: a big cake costs ten cents, a thin book costs two or three yuan, and specialized books cannot be handled without a hundred gold. Please think about it, a big cake is enough to maintain life, is studying hard a waste? It is our current responsibility to preserve this bit of energy for the nation and society. - Their inherited responsibility lies in the future! Please don't forget them!</p>
<p>The desire to learn in the midst of adversity is for the sake of objective and realistic needs. On the isolated island, we often see some wealthy children who have good cultivation conditions, but abandon their heavenly responsibility, indulge in joy and depravity, - without any spirit of hard work, but only determined to self-destruct! We can't help but sigh for it. On the other hand, there are many scholars who are tightening their stomachs and working hard, and some even have no opportunity for further study. They are wandering and waiting for the sympathy of enthusiastic people in the society.</p>
<p>Whose responsibility is this?</p>
<p>Since ancient times, it has been a great virtue to subsidize the lamp oil of poor scholars, so that they can work hard in the environment of 断虀劃粥, and if they achieve something, they will add a brilliant story to the giver and the recipient. This is an excellent traditional feudal morality, but it is given a new social significance today.</p>
<p>Romain Rolland said, "Only heroes receive the bread of hardship and trial." Cultivating people for society - making the seeds of hard study in the world flourish, not too utilitarianly, is also a great pleasure in life! In such a difficult life, people like Mr. Shen Fengbiao still generously reveal their true feelings, so that those who achieve the Way can get more help. Why not do it for other aspiring people?</p>
<p>We respectfully ask everyone to extend a warm hand of sympathy to cooperate!</p>
<h3>Problems at the Market</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>Precarious Livelihoods of Seymour Road Market Vendors:  Can a New Market Be Built?</p>
<p>Law and Russia are products of fairness and human sentiment.</p>
<p>I saw a news item in the newspaper about the relocation of the Seymour Road Market.  Originally, the property belonged to the Sassoon tycoon, but Mr. Sassoon suddenly had a "brainwave" and wanted to "change the market property into a warehouse" — thus, this historic market, which sustains the lives of vendors, cannot exist under Mr. Sassoon's resolute attitude!</p>
<p>Perhaps this will trouble some housewives. But what is causing panic are these poor vendors. They live here and eat here, and undoubtedly, their livelihoods are solved here.  This time, limited to "closing the market on August 31st," in today's difficult times, the suffering of these vendors facing this major "disaster" is beyond the imagination of outsiders.</p>
<p>Thus, the last resort is for the lawyer to appeal to the court. However, according to reports, "vendors have no hope of winning," and "from a purely legal point of view," British law stipulates that landlords have the right to freely dispose of their property. The vendors' appeal to the law will inevitably be met with failure.</p>
<p>Speaking from a human perspective, since Mr. Sassoon is a multi-millionaire, he might as well buy vacant land to build a warehouse. Moreover, the market is not a "charitable organization." The rent and miscellaneous fees paid by the vendors every year are also a considerable income.  Considering the timing, what time is this? Everything is expensive, and livelihoods are dwindling. The vendors' rice bowls are about to be broken.</p>
<p>As for the "aftermath" problem, the Public Works Department revealed that the solution is to merge with the Racecourse Market. However, upon guessing, it is not very likely. First, the Racecourse Market is already full of vendors. Second, the public places in the lower society all have certain "territories." The Seymour Road vendors moving to the Racecourse Market seems to imply "grabbing territory" and will affect the business of the Racecourse vendors. Third, land is scarce, and since the Racecourse Market is already full of vendors, if the Seymour Road vendors move in, there may be problems with the rent and miscellaneous fees of the market.</p>
<p>Therefore, this solution still needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>The most "fortunate solution" is, of course, to build a new market. However, it is questionable whether the Public Works Department intends to cover this expense.</p>
<p>This issue, I hope everyone pays attention to it.</p>
<h3>Bus Fares Increase Again</h3>
<p>— Cao Wenhai</p>
<p>The fares of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company and the China General Omnibus Company actually increased again from the 14th. This time, the tram fare increased, "first class averaging from 6.37 cents per mile to 9.11 cents, and third class averaging from 4.87 cents per mile to 7.49 cents" (for example, the trolleybus from the Great World to Nanjing Road, previously sold for 7 cents, is now sold for 15 cents; to Sichuan Road Bridge, previously sold for 12 cents, is now sold for 20 cents). The reason they hold is that "the exchange rate continues to shrink, and due to the war abroad, the source of fuel is not easy, various expenses have increased sharply, and the company's investment should have reduced net profit;" The reason for the bus company: "Since the fare revision in December last year, various prices have risen sharply" and the issuance of subsidies to employees has led to a sharp increase in expenditure and difficulties in coping, so they requested to increase the fares."</p>
<p>Reduced income is naturally due to poor business and insufficient cost. Naturally, raising prices is a method. After the war, the "isolated island" developed grotesquely, and residents clustered in one corner. The authorities of the Concession once announced that the number of residents within the boundary has increased several times compared to before the war. The passengers of buses and trams are naturally very crowded, and the vehicles are not enough. The authorities of the two companies also know this situation.</p>
<p>However, since passengers support it, the company's income has decreased instead, repeatedly increasing fares. The burden on the citizens is indeed unbearable. May I ask how much benefit the company can actually get from each increase in fares? It is indeed a question. If we do not want to treat the root cause to increase net profit, and repeatedly raise prices due to the so-called reduced income, I am afraid that the fares of public transport will be more expensive than rickshaws in the future. At that time, the number of people taking the bus may not be as crowded as it is now.</p>
<p>"Mr. X, how is your shop doing?"</p>
<p>"Not bad, the rain has moistened it, and the old rice from the past few years has swelled up and become a bit heavier."</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Eleven   Midnight Song</p>
<p>"This semester looks hopeless!" Mei Bao sat in front of a small stove, fanning the charcoal in the stove with a palm fan, looking listlessly at the earthenware medicine pot placed on the stove, secretly thinking.</p>
<p>That's right, today is already October 20th! Hengshui County Middle School started on September 1st. Because of Begonia's illness, Mei Bao has been absent from school for almost two months.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, Begonia has indeed been hardworking enough. Although her physical strength has become much stronger than when she earned thousands of dollars on stage because of constant exercise, she is still somewhat inferior compared to the average farmer. Therefore, after working every day, she always seemed more tired than Zhang Xiaogouzi. At the same time, her tortuous and desolate life experience was like a large bluestone, pressing tightly on her heart all year round, making her feel that she rarely had happy days. When everything was quiet at night, her thoughts could no longer be calm, often disturbing her to the point of insomnia all night long. In addition, because she wanted to save money, she wore and ate very poorly, and slowly, without realizing it, she laid down the root of her illness.</p>
<p>In the autumn of this year, when Mei Bao wanted to pack her things and rush into the city before the start of school - she is now a sophomore in junior high school - Begonia suddenly fell ill. At first, it only seemed like malaria. As usual, she stubbornly refused to see a doctor or take medicine. When her illness worsened, and a doctor was finally called, her illness had turned into typhoid fever.</p>
<p>"Child, it doesn't matter. You should go to school!" He also knew that the start of school was approaching and did not want to hinder his beloved daughter's studies, so he repeatedly urged Mei Bao to go to the city. "I have Xiaogouzi to take care of me. Why keep you here?"</p>
<p>Of course, Mei Bao was reluctant to leave, so she repeatedly refused and stubbornly stayed for a few more days. Begonia was already delirious, so Mei Bao served him day and night in front of his bed, unknowingly spending forty or fifty days in the sickroom filled with the smell of medicine.</p>

<h3>"Air Bread"</h3>
<p>— Yao Yao</p>
<p>On Xinzha Road in this city, there is a certain candy and biscuit factory. Inside, the machines are rumbling, and a large amount of bread and biscuits are produced every day. The aroma is sent out from the windows in waves. People passing by stop involuntarily and smell it for a while. Sometimes, when they happen to be hungry, their stomachs rumble, their index fingers twitch, and some people say that the people standing there are eating "air bread."</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Wave Vocal Society</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Last Sunday night, introduced by a friend, I visited a musical group—Wave.</p>
<p>As soon as I walked into the alley, I vaguely heard a majestic singing. In today’s isolated island, where everyone is singing soft, drowsy tunes like "A Flower on the Lapel," hearing another kind of singing by chance was naturally very exciting.</p>
<p>However, after entering the door, I gasped. It turned out to be a small classroom, filled with young men and women. They didn’t seem to feel the heat and stuffiness at all. They were just stretching their throats and singing, with sweat dripping on their faces.</p>
<p>"The Women Worker's Song," "No One Allowed to Pass," "The Motherland March," "Torch,"... This righteous singing and enthusiastic emotion enveloped the entire room. These are young people with thoughts and spirit.</p>
<p>When it was time to leave, I shook hands with Yin Chong, the musical leader of the society, and had a conversation with Zhang Chao, the general affairs officer:</p>
<p>"Please tell me something about Wave."</p>
<p>"It's very simple. Wave is organized by several amateur young people. We don't have a background boss, so naturally we don't have a lot of funds. Rent, handouts, ink, all expenses, in addition to the membership fees of four corners per month from the members, are automatically donated by enthusiasts. We gather once a week to adjust our tired spirits."</p>
<p>"Are the songs you sing all of the hard type?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. Sometimes we sing soft songs, but they are always meaningful songs. We don't hum those tunes about brothers and sisters."</p>
<p>"Are you going to hold a performance recently?"</p>
<p>"We have decided to hold a fundraising performance on September 6th. At that time, we will also invite music instructors such as Chen Gexin and Zhang Hao to help, and Miss Zhu Ming, who is famous in the art world for singing 'Heavenly Ethics Song,' has also agreed to make a guest appearance."</p>
<p>When I left, the majestic singing still lingered in my ears.</p>
<p>Hong Huijun, a rising star of the Kun Opera, is beautiful and talented in singing. Her voice is clear, sweet, and mellow, and her appearance is particularly beautiful and gorgeous. She is skilled in many Qingyi and Huashan plays, such as "Spring and Autumn Match" and "Cuiping Mountain," which are her masterpieces. She has been a mainstay of the Tianyunlou Grand Theater for many years. She has now been hired by the New World Grand Beijing Opera Troupe and will perform her masterpiece there starting tonight.

<h3>Blood Rain, Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve  Utter Helplessness Like Ning Wu</p>
<p>Although Liu Yin Ying entrusted the old monk to be quiet about the matter, he was very uneasy in his own heart. He looked up and stared blankly at the sky, silent, only stamping his feet and sighing. After a while, the fire was still raging, and the red light on the horizon was sometimes dim and sometimes strong, and many fire crows were dancing in the air. It was really a big fire, reflecting the windows red. Liu Yin Ying hesitated outside, but he heard Xu Jing shout from inside the room: "Where is my virtuous brother? Where is my virtuous brother?" Liu Yin Ying heard the sound and hurried into the room. Seeing Xu Jing sitting on the kang, he said, "What are you calling for, Jing Ge?" Xu Jing said, "Why has my virtuous brother been out for so long and not returned to the room? The red light reflected on the paper window, is there a big fire nearby?" As he spoke, he pointed to the paper window. Liu Yin Ying knew that this matter could not be hidden after all, so he sighed and replied, "That's right, there is a big fire outside. Just now, I was outside observing the direction of the fire, and it's most likely Ningwu Pass..." Liu Yin Ying hadn't finished speaking when Xu Jing jumped up from the kang and said, "Oh no! That's not good! Ningwu Pass has probably been captured by the bandits. How can General Zhou deal with it alone? Let's rush back immediately, even before dawn." Liu Yin Ying hurried over and pressed him down, then said, "Jing Ge, don't struggle recklessly. Your arm hasn't healed yet, and it might bleed again. I suspect that this fire means that Ningwu Pass has been lost. Even if you and I rush back at this moment, naked, without a single soldier, it will be of no use. If it's just the fire set by the bandits when they attacked the city, and General Zhou can still defend it, then we can rush there early tomorrow morning, and it will still be in time." Xu Jing said, "I hope General Zhou can hold it, and there will still be hope for rescue. Otherwise, by the time you and I rush there tomorrow, I'm afraid it will be too late. General Zhou once said to me that retreating from Daizhou to Ningwu Pass was a last resort. If Ningwu is lost, the general is unwilling to retreat any further and vows to coexist with this pass. General Zhou's loyalty and bravery are rare in the world. If those who guard the land could all be like this, how could the bandits be so rampant? We can't make contributions and kill enemies under the command of a good general. Isn't this the will of heaven? Uncle Wang Yongtai has already died in battle, Fan Cheng has also died, Wang Weiguo died in the line of duty, and I am injured to this point. Only Zhang Lie is by the general's side. The situation is too isolated, so naturally he can't defeat the rising crowd of bandits. This is the heaven's will regarding Ningwu, not a fault of war!" (116)</p>
<h3>Following "Tears Splashed on Flowers," Golden Star Will Film "Shanghai Nights"</h3>
<p>— Bei Shi</p>
<p>Yu Ling, like Xia Yan, is a playwright who portrays the real society of Shanghai. His "Women's Apartment" and "Tears Splashed on Flowers" have been praised by a large audience on the stage. The former has already been made into a film by the United Film Company and released, and the film adaptation rights of the latter have also been purchased by Golden Star, starring Hu Feng, Xia Xia, Shen Min, and Shu Shi, and will soon be seen by audiences.</p>
<p>Now, following "Tears Splashed on Flowers," Golden Star will film another work by Yu Ling, "Shanghai Nights," which still exposes the real life of Shanghai. It has been performed on stage several times, and the evaluation is as high as "Tears Splashed on Flowers." Moreover, "Tears Splashed on Flowers" is a social tragedy with dancers as the warp and compradors as the weft, with the background only before the August 13th Incident, while "Shanghai Nights" is the social dynamics of Shanghai after the war, depicting mainland businessmen who have fled to Shanghai to seek refuge, and all kinds of life are very profound.</p>
<p>The formulaic love tragedies have been eliminated after the costume films, so "Shanghai Nights" and the like should be used as a basis for film screenwriters.</p>
<p>Brief News  (1) The China Summer Theater Society will hold the first performance of Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm," directed by Zhou Chu, with a strong cast of actors. It is scheduled to be performed today at the Swatow Theater, stage director Shu Shi. (2) The filming of "Cherish the Time of Parting," produced by Guohua, starring Bai Yun and Zhou Manhua, has been completed and will be screened at the Jincheng Theater this month. "Cherish the Time of Parting" is an original work by Gu Mingdao, published by Chunming Bookstore, and will be published soon.</p>
<h3>Special Little Records of People in the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Written by South Melody and North Tune, Illustrated by Zhang Yu and Wu Zhang</p>
<p>(22) Little Cuihua</p>
<p>Little Cuihua is a pure Hua Dan (female comic role), and her fame came earlier than that of Gou Huisheng. Her artistic skills are appreciated for their genuine skill, and there is no need to use charming looks to please the public. After Tian Guifeng and Lu Yushan, Little Cuihua is the best in the play "Drunkenness." She is originally from Shandong, surnamed Yu, named Lianquan. Her father once worked in the political world. Lianquan first entered the Mingshenghe Opera School at the age of nine, with the stage name Yu Shengqin, also known as Little Peony Flower, and was very much favored by the class leader Shuixianhua (Guo Jixiang). Later, Mingshenghe disbanded and she transferred to Fuliancheng, specializing in Huashan roles. By the age of fourteen, she had already begun to stand out. Her stilt skills are excellent, and no Dan role can surpass her. In recent years, due to indulging in addiction, her appearance has deteriorated greatly, but insiders and outsiders still praise her unanimously. She has a younger sister who is married to the well-known Xiaosheng Jin Zhongren.</p>
