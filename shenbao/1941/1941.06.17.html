<h3>游資泛濫中之宣洩</h3>
<p>上海金融於今可謂極駘蕩之閒致矣；劃頭旣申水，而匯劃復由貼水而申水，事之奇，固無有逾於此者。其實不足異，蓋金錢之為物，與一般物品無以異，得其用則氣燄萬丈，若不可一世；不得其用，則所謂黃金變色，直與糞土之壞等耳，故一切價值之貴賤，不僅繫於供求，亦且寄於計算。計算之為有利，雖賤亦取，計算之為無利，雖貴奚用。今之現鈔也，劃頭也，匯劃也，同是一物耳，劃頭為立可取現之現鈔，匯劃乃為有限制支現之現鈔，是則現鈔為其母，而劃頭匯劃為其子，子母相替，母須貼於子，是安得不為奇。但分析之，亦無非基於人心之計算作用耳！平昔求現鈔而不可得，於是轉輾求之，不惜貼水一二百元，以求必得。今刖物價奇昂，款項之授受，日以繁廡，收解之數量，隨之龐大，現鈔有檢點之煩，而有路刦之憂；再加以三者間利率之厚薄，限制之多寡，人情孰小舍其難而從其便，重其利而輕其貨，遂不期然而惟票據是重；策安全，少危險，便授受，省手續，節時間，此申水之所由來也，而現鈔遂為之失色。</p>
<p>惟是現鈔之必終為現鈔也，一朝收縮，焉知不貼水立時恢復。今特苦於泛濫之為患耳！泛濫之為患，即游資充斥之謂也。游資泛濫，自有其宣洩之方。在法幣世界，鈔票與公債，本可等量齊觀；公債可作躉批之鈔票觀，鈔票可作零星之公債觀，鈔票多，則用公債吸收；鈔票少，則由公偵吐出，是即通貨盈虛消息之所由，而得歸於平衡之一途。不僅如此，以目前存款利息之低微，劃頭存放，復多種種限制，曷如公債之流通自如，照市申算，猶是利息高厚之為愈。蓋公債者，固可視為附有利息之鈔票也。然在好為投機之說者，以為公債之利息固厚，比之囤積居奇之所獲，暴利壘纍，一本數利，誠藐乎其微，不值一顧。而不念大利所在，害亦隨之，囤積居奇，固有時可致鉅富，亦有時可盡喪其貲，事未有利害不相隨者。惟公債以債信之顛撲不破，雖無大利，亦無大害，孝經有云：「滿而不溢，所以長守富也」，惟投資於公債，乃深得滿而不溢之道。</p>
<p>如其必欲成巨富、亦非可以投機得之。投機所得，有如賭博，「浪裏來，浪裹去」，礙難持久。且果不惜冒大險，以期巨貲之必獲，則何如以囤積居奇之資財，用之於闢草萊，興寳藏，建大業，立巨產，歐美之大富豪，稱雄一世，顯赫一時，皆為能有此創業精神，善用其財；用其一己之財猶不足，利用大衆之財；以一已之才力有不逮，集衆人之力；於是雖歷盡險阻，冒盡艱危，事無有不成，功無有不立，而財亦無有不發，此所謂投天下之大機，能為國家興利，人羣造福，自利利他，流澤無窮也。至若囤積居奇，祇知因緣時會，向大衆生活上剝削以自肥，損人利己，遑恤乎公衆，一旦時勢轉移，市況變遷，又焉知覆亡不立待。故擁有巨資者曷不高瞻遠囑，如今之西南西北各地，原野每每叢山疊疊，蘊藏豐富，利棄於地，所謂滿地皆黃金，不可唾手取之耳！則以跼踳於上海之游資，泛濫為患，宣洩無由，大可乘此時機，集結才財，移資內向，旣得保障，又得大利，目前之艱險，固一時之現象也。抑西南西北，已非昔比，交通綱之搆成，力足能助工商業之發展。東南雖號稱為財富之區，然以數千年來生斯食斯，地力不無有時而窮。未來之開展，要在平素所不為人所措意者，經之營之，招之徠之，化瓦礫為黃金，納游資於正軌，是在人之努力何如耳！</p>
<h3>德義報復美資凍結　亦將作同樣行動　義已調查美人在義資產　德將施前起草之沒收令</h3>
<p>合衆社十六日羅馬電　墨索里尼首相、為報復美凍結軸心國在美之資金、今晨八時巳下令凍結美僑財產、故義全國之美籟僑民、已不能向銀行提取彼等之存款、</p>
<p>合衆社十六日羅馬電　僑居羅馬之美僑的一千人、昨日正設法欲在今日向各銀行提取存款、因彼等在各銀行均存有私款彼等設法提疑之原因、義方頃宣稱、因羅斯福總統下令凍結德義存美之資金後、義亦將對在意國境內之一切美國財產加以報復、現居意美僑的有五千人、此閒一般預測、認　美僑將因此而遭受貧困之苦、義官方之公報稱、義報復之方法、若明白霄之、即美對義採取如何處置、義亦將對美採同樣處置、現美　之財產、巳將開始調查、以便於美國凍結義資金開始後、即予以沒收云、</p>
<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電　此間早已料到、義國將有凍結在義笑人資產之報復行動、官塲尚未發表批評、但衆認羅馬此舉、大都為學理上空談、因義國現行之貨幣統制、早已使美人不能撤回其在義之投資矣、德國亦復如此、查美人在義資產、估值美金一萬四千三百萬元、在德脊產、估值四萬二千七百</p>
<p>合衆社十六日柏林電　衆信德國二月餘以前所草擬之沒收美人在德產業之命令、即將立予實行、以報復羅斯福總統凍結軸心在美資金之舉、據悉、美國前此沒收在美德輪之時、德國即草擬此案、藉資報復、惟其後又打消原案、衆信德國將與義國同時採取報復步驟、權威界發言人拒不批評此事、對德人在美究有資產若干、亦拒不肯加以估許、</p>
<p>合衆社十六日華盛頓電　財部法律部份某官吏昨日稱、羅斯福總統頒發之凍結命令及附帶關於登記在美外人產業二事、亦將適用於菲列濱、該令之第五項規定云、所謂「勢國」者、乃「美國及任何受美國法律管轄各地」之謂、</p>
<p>合衆社十六日柏林電　德權威人士頃稱、美國凍結德義存款之舉動、絕不公正、並稱德義之對抗計劃、恐已在考慮中、</p>
<p>美軸心資金　已設法逃避</p>
<p>合衆社十六日紐約電　昨日此間表示、欲將軸心國存　之財產、眞實編造成冊、　屬非常困難之事、華文街方面　、軸心資金已被圓滑地逃避、以視瑞士各機關之資金數額之龐大、即為顯例、現瑞士存美之款竟達十五萬萬之巨、而德國之存款僅三四萬萬元、若干貨幣學專家相信、德義在最近數週中、仍繼續調撥其被凍結之資金、財政方面人士稱、雖然知悉瑞士之財產中必參有德義之投資、然欲特別在瑞士之財產中、分離德義之資金、殊為困難、該方面並預測、尚有其他部份之軸心資金、巳由瑞士以外其他國籍之商人出面、從事財務之活動、華文街方面稱、羅總統之凍結軸心資金之處置可使總義無法在美積緊財產、</p>

<p>論及美國參加上次歐戰的原因，必先從威爾遜總統的個性說起。總統職權所在，對於外交政策常自決定，而國際局勢愈嚴重，美國的外交政策也愈益舉足輕重。威爾遜總統向來不喜別人越俎代謀，他本人就是自已的外交部長。他體察與情的動向之後，對於各種重耍的決策，都獨斷獨行。他發表「不屑戰」的演說，並遺回德國大使彭斯托夫，絕無商議的餘地。當時美國的情緒確然於偏袒央法，況且美國經濟的繁榮，亦惟與央法維持貿易是賴。但謂這些事實，就是美國參戰的原因，也是皮相之談。</p>
<p>威爾遜個人對於各交戰國的感情，從各方面都可證明，固小免存心偏袒央法，却父堅持這種感情，不得影響國策。所以結果交戰國　方都指他偏袒對方，而向他攻擊。但他以維持美國和平為唯一職責，則絕無疑問。自一九一五年八月「阿刺伯」號輪船被德國潛艇擊沉時起，他就抱着這個雙重政策。他說，「全國人民責成我使美國置身戰爭漩渦之外，我們若果貿然參戰，整個世界大局即將瓦解，一切公平解決方法，亦隨之絕望。」德國雖加以重大侮辱，他寗抱此種政策而不變。同年九月，他吿訴他的親信說，「全國為我　盾，絕無　　。我務須極度忍耐，但忍耐　何種限度，仍小失為一種美德，則頗費思索了。」</p>
<p>但威爾遜　決意保持美國和平外，更決心保護本國的中立權利。他堅持美國的榮譽應高於一切。一九一六年二月。他使國家不捲入戰爭漩渦，我已勉力從事。但國人還托付我一件大事，就是維護美國的榮譽，不使遭　沽汚，這事非我所能　力，而須　交戰國的行動為轉移了。因此之故，美國的榮譽與和平，隨時都有無法維護的危險。此種矛盾的悄勢，國人幸勿苛責。」</p>
<p>威爾遜曾用鐵面無私的態度，維護美國中立權利，斥責交戰國雙方。他認英法的海上封鎖政策，違反國際公法，曾提出抗議，聲明美國不承認這種半封鎖狀熊為合法。一九一六年夏末，國會授予總統大權，許其在必要時，得禁止貸款和實施禁運，以為報復手段。數星期後，他主張强硬警吿央國外相格萊說：「美國人民對於中立權利遭受侵犯，日益焦躁，他們反英情緒的熱烈，與起初反德時不相上下。」</p>
<p>總統　英法沒有實施禁運的原因，　在英法妨碍中立國貿易問題正鬧得沸騰的時候，德國忽然擴大潛艇破壞政策，移轉了美國的注意。好斯上校在他的回憶錄中說，「德國倘不以戰術關係，失去美國的同情，美國決不致將公海的貿易，聽任英法控制。」英國當時的海相邱吉爾也說過，德國初試潛艇政策，已給我們莫大的幫助。我們和美國的齟齬從此化為烏有，一時人心大慰。</p>
<p>威爾遜相信德國的侵犯美國權利，性質與英法迥不相同，對刊的方法，亦隨之而異。德國的潛艇政策，若專用以針對英法的海上封鎖，原可加以容忍，但這種政策損害中立幽的權利甚大。潛水艇內戰術的關係，對於交戰國或中立國的商船，無論裝載遠禁品與吾，都不使發出驚吿，而須突然予以擊沉，然後迅速逃去，對於船上乘客和水手，都不便救護。威爾遜　國內一般輿情，對於德國這種大規模破壞行動，大為震驚。這　不是法理上的微妙問題。德國潛艇不分皂白，摧毀美國生命財產，與英法的對鎖，自然大異其趣。一九一七年一月至三月間，美國各港口有貨山積，百業凋敝，就是潛艇威脅的結果。</p>
<p>如果潛艇政策，僅使美國物質利益遭受威脅，威爾遜還不致同德宣戰。他素來不以純粹的物質利益為國策前提。德美關係雖然荊棘滿途，但經濟問題的解決，尚小致瀕於絕境。特德國的潛艇戰術，弁髦美國船員和乘客的生命，就牽涉到人道問題。物質利益與人權之間，界限顯然。（未完）</p>

<h3>中華靑年會昨日　舉行升學指導演講　顧琢人講「大學入門」</h3>
<p>中華基督教靑年會畢生部主持之升學指導演講、業於昨日午午四時、在八仙僑該會大禮堂開始舉行、由之江大學訓導處主任顧琢人氏講「大學入門」、略謂</p>
<p>顧及人性</p>
<p>諸君在中國社會中、為一千人中之一人、下期考進大學後、將為一萬人中之一人、機會難得、可以想見、允其際此抗建大時代中、得進大學、殊非易易、故緒君升學問題、倘不妥慎處理、實甚可惜、因之升學指導、需要益切、此項指導在英美諸國甚屬平凡、但在中國社會中、至為罕見、往往有力升學者、因僅顧及社會趨向、面對自己個性、疏略考慮、致所學者未能盡量發揮、如今日中國對專門技術人才正切急需、多數學生遂因應此需要、對工程課等、莫不趨之若繁、然每因個性不能適合、勉强攻研所得甚為有限、由是第一流人才甚為少見、故諸君於升學前、應先自我分析、檢討本身個性究商於那一部門技能、</p>
<p>舉例三點</p>
<p>例如通常職業的可分為三類、（一）對人之關係、（二）對物之關係（三）對想像力之關係設君等將來欲側身醫界使成功一著名之醫生則其先決問題為君等對人深感興趣吾、吾則對無數病人將無法處理、欲業律師者亦若是、必善於交際、吾則閉門在家、將無人過問、關於第二點、設君等攻農科·化學、則必須對於物深感興趣、第三點、設君等欲成為一著名文藝作家、則必富有充分想像力、以上所述、係一人個性與其擇學之關係、惟無絕對之分別、僅係程度上之比較而已、</p>
<p>第二認識</p>
<p>至於對上述三點均感興趣　、則其興趣甚廣泛、宜為新聞記者、亦即具有領袖之天才、對自己認識之後、尚須認識大學是什麼所謂「知己知彼百戰百勝是也、關於此點、（一）大學係求學問的一階段、而非結東、蓋學問原無止境、在此階段中、將吿爾讀書的方法研究的法則教帥指導的時間少、自己研究的時間多、與中學顯然不同、此四年乃為必經之階段、（二）有人謂將大學生稱之為「翰林」「土大夫」、似甚落伍、宜稱為「君子」、蓋在大學時期內、人格學問均受訓練也、故大學乃將爾訓練成一個完人、（三）大學時期所攻之課程、與畢業後所獲之工作、容或有若干距離、如攻鐵路工程者、畢業後服務於公路、亦無不可、一般人認為在大學攻何課程、即已決定共將來固定工作、此實錯誤、（四）大學中所修課程恒係普遍的、勿以為旣有專門、何必尚須兼讀其他必修科、須知許多部門之學問、均有不可分開之聯擊、</p>
<p>體格訓練</p>
<p>最後欲進大學、宜先注意體格之鍛鍊、吾則領到大學畢業文憑後、帶入棺材裏去、有何用處、豈非徒費寳貴金錢、此外關於入學考試、選擇學校、亦宜注意、前者不宜過分看得嚴重、只須在中學時期、係眞正求學、考入大學、並無問題、為慎重計、至多同時考兩個大學、有人一考四個大學、大可不必、徒浪費精神時間與報名費、考前一二日、最好不看書、養精蓄力、以備全力以赴、有人臨時抱佛脚、考試前夕大開夜車、於事有百害而無一利、</p>
<p>考試法門</p>
<p>又考時應將能解答問題、盡量解答、以求得更多分數、蓋學校錄取新生、僅係比較之標準、並無絕對之標準、又關於選擇大學有兩點、（一）課程頗多、（二）教授須確具學識、叉關於大學考試課目、凡經國府教育部立案者之文商學院、文科方面為公民·國文·英文·數學·（代數平面幾何三角）中外史地生物、理工方面為公民·國文·英文·數學·（高等代數解釋幾何三角）中外　地·理化、</p>

<p>修學講座</p>
<h3>怎樣研究英文（五）</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>單字要選得精、倒不在乎很多、沙士比亞只有一萬五千個、共次是塔克立、不過八九千、史蒂文生只有六七千、其餘大概四五千、普通人有三千左右好字、足矣夠矣、可是得知道準確的用法、僅僅認識、不足為數、所謂精選、（一）要讀標準作家的文章、（二）要拿出眼光來挑選、每天能收羅二三個、至多四五個就了不起了、</p>
<p>至於文典和修詞學、最好不要死讀、覺得有需要的時候、拿來參考一下就行了、</p>
<p>讀　文可以不必記誦、但碰見很好的句子、很可摘記在隨身的小册子中、碰見很好的節段、也可抄錄下來、預備常觀摩、可也不必太多、多了就容易生厭、</p>
<p>寫</p>
<p>一、佈局　知道怎樣讀、就應當知道怎樣寫、老套的作文是「起承轉合」四字訣、現代作文是、引一二三結」、與老套大同小異、引是序論、一二三是論點、結是結論、短篇作文、可以截頭去尾、最重要的還是結結實實的幾個論點、不着邊際的廢話最好免談、佈局的方式、請參看前文第一條「怎樣讀」就可明瞭了、</p>
<p>二、練習　練習作文、最妙的辦法是自作自改、富蘭克林就是這樣幹而後才得成功、他的辦法是拿人家的好文、節下大意、過了兩天就按這大意發揮成文、然後與原文對照、對照的時候須耍平心靜氣、聚會精神、我的為什麼不好、人家的好在那裹、曉得了人家的好點、就得畢到手、我們很可以把好文章譯下一小段、過一天兩天再譯回頭、與原文逐句對照、細心揣摩、初練的時候、即使一句不對、都不打緊、「只耍肯用心、錘鐵磨成針」、</p>

<h3>外幣尙穩</h3>
<p>咋日外幣市況、　　　　跌、然現金則趨高漲、故英美金鎊尚屬穩定、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票於開盤竟高至四角半、但旋即步落、卒以十八元一角九分收盤、比上週軋跌一分、香港票趨勢疲軟、市價步軟、日金票及朝鮮票均無上落、前者仍站一元九角三分原價、後者仍為一元六角三分、</p>
<h3>慘烈賣風中　金價急瀉</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤續跌益銳、價巳破人六千四百元大關內、乃既承上週末之疲勢、美總統更下令凍結德義等國在美資金、美滙七月五元四三七五、尚有供無求、金價在一致慘烈賣風中、在落見六千三百五十五元低價、因下跌已逾外滙之鬆度、結價所撳復巨、滙票商新豐、永獨來套進六七千兩、外滙亦止鬆稍回、價又盤上、至午刻達六千三百九十八元、下午聞中國駐美大使郭泰祺已平安抵渝、任外長消息、人心興奮卞、且遠月美金復賤、大豐義元復出、價重挫落、終見軋小四十五兀、全日交易六七萬兩、掉期（六月轉入七月）由賣方義豐貼出予明豐五萬兩、及益大四百五十兩、均五十元、又高八元、現金則反上漲、永豐餘出時和五十兩、萬豐出五十兩、永豐餘出二十兩、一利出三十兩、均成記買進、價照期亦高二百五十元、下午祥和進天元二十兩、高三百五十元、軋升十五元、飾金等均平、</p>
<p>期貨跌四十五元</p>
<p>自晨七月期每條（十兩）因報載消息利於賣方、人心虛軟、價乃退至六千四百元內、九點十五分開市為六千三百八十元、計低三十六元、新豐永裕興永及各戶賣勢下、由六千三百八十五元、再銳傾進、浮空跟起傾補、外滙止鬆稍回、價又盤上至六千三百八十元左右、近午新豐永一再套進的六七千兩、大豐·順源·成記均買、升至六千三百九十八元、午收六千三百九十三元、下午二點開市六千三百九十元、計開低三元、繼續降至六千三百八十五元、恒記·新豐永力進、升至六千三百九十五元、俄見大豐·義豐·德大·熾大來售出、且下月美金五元四三七五難賣、價遂步降至六千三百六十八元、同康永。新豐永力進、升至六千三百七十二元、三點半收市六千三百七十一元、比上週六午收小四十五元、照七月美金五六四三七五計算、結價六千四百〇四元六局、計撳三十三元六角、全日有四十三元差度、現金號之木牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高三百六十元、收進比售出低七十元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>首飾金尙未掛小</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均仍掛六百九十五元、收進減四十元云、</p>
<h3>紗花　雙馬廠單日緊　紗價漲風可畏　最高價一五一六元　已與金價背道而馳</h3>
<p>盤旋數日之紗巿、昨則復趨上升、且漲風殊熾、此因廣幫對於雙　紗需要繼續不懈、以致雙馬廠單較緊、空方每日掉期貼出角五分至七角五分、於此多頭更為安定、可以減少利鈿一半、至於空頭鑒於如斯情形、天天貼出利鈿、每十包自二元半至七元半、而廣幫生意不斷、心意不一、於是忍痛扒補、抬風一緊、市盤直趨上升、最後收盤價為一干五百十一元、但一般實力充足之空額、因標余不振、並小抵補、仍在掙扎中、二十支雙馬最高價為一千五百十一元、低價為一千四百六十五元、午後初開、一鬨漲至一千五白十六元、旋以盈利吐出、證券幫復夾賣出、回落至一千四百九十二元、最後價為一千四百九十六元、有人要進云、今日有棉紗一百四十五件　香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因報載日軍在南海擴大對銀綫、凍結歐洲淪陷各國資金、人心平平、首盤價為一千四百匕十五元、浮戶賣出、及空頭壓迫、跌至一千叫百六十五元、豈料一霎間、多說廣幫雙馬仍在交易、塲中買氣頗濃、市盤忽見上升、漲至一千四百九十五元、迨至收盤時、謠言多多、皆屬利多、又漲至一千五百十一元收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬〇七百二十包、內香港幫進一千七百二十包、同行丸千包、</p>
<p>金雙馬標準紗市況、自開盤以後、逐步上升、午後開盤續升、但收盤回小、結果七月期漲七元、八月期漲三元、查全日成交統計八千六百包、反較現貨為少、此因投機者尚未集中巨量額子、不易配合、一般情願多空均出利鈿而向現貨市塲鑽營矣、</p>

<h3>疋頭　花紗艾跳　廠布一致提升</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨漲、乃因本街及港幫南洋幫進胃轉濃、而外棉現紗價格均見上騰、影響人心、同業及囤戶亦來吸收、故各布售盤一致提升、白貨組布·細布斜紋漲（每疋）二角半至五角、漂染布漲五角之譜、本街成交各布六百餘件、粵港南洋幫辦色布漂布粗布斜紋四百餘件、北路　台靑島幫　辦色素嗶嘰綫呢等貨四五十件、今日有疋頭七白件　香港、</p>
<p>東布　白貨細布細斜漲（每疋）四五角、十二磅龍頭細布棧單起伏範圍殊狹、後市收盤價為四十五元一角、色貨四君子嗶嘰肉紗綫猛漲、囤戶繼續搜辦、晨開一元四角五分八七五、逐步上騰、在跳至一元五角一分半、後市變馬紗回跌市勢頓挫、同業手貨亦肯鬆害、一度降至一元四角九分一二五、收盤時又復回昂為一元四角九分七五、</p>
<h3>糧食　今日又有五萬包到　洋米續跌　甬幫裝辦　碎米獨挺</h3>
<p>工部局洋米不斷到　、太古公司寗海輪昨晨抵埠、由香港裝來工部局洋米一萬包、該輪昨日停靠油東碼頭、定今晨駛至法租界外灘該行碼頭起卸、華綸洋行經理之某美輪、由仰光直接載運大批洋米來滬、原定前日抵滬、是日未見進口、昨據該行稱、改今日到埠、洋米的有四萬包之譜、預　停靠浦東陸茂碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>洋米昨市大部份繼續趨跌、惟碎米有寗波幫裝辦、市乃疲而復漲、結果仍與前收相似、西貢小紋各米初跌後站、結果仍比上週六收市價小去一元左右、緣早晨開市時因逾來定到兩多、公賣米續在訂購批出中、客囤心田向卜、市上賣氣極濃、開市後高决各米一律下跌、小去元外至二元左右不等、繼甬幫趁小吸收、允注神於碎米、不論現貨及英華司原包均有大量收進、均以甬幫一幫已經辦去有一萬五六千包、連同原包在內、市乃逐步回振、惟其他各米因本客兩淡、結果仍見疲落、碎米英華司初開一百零七元、繼自一百零七元二角至一百零八元不等、小絞亦自百二十七元漲達百二十八元半、路貨一百卅六元、一號西貢早市開一百三十六元、後　貨方扳俏、曾有喊高一二元、然未經成議、全日成交英華司一千三四百噸、現米的一萬五千包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、南港早晚稻自中間一朝休業、來源頓見積多、而木鄉店胃以天時關係、叉屬懈淡、　市面立呈供過於求、依然疲軟不振、做開各價　見低落二元半光景、計售新鮮早晚稻百二十一元·百三十元、宿百念六七元、宿原包百念七元、厚粳市上仍祇一些無錫原包宿梗而已、旣以貨稀、價父賤廉、故貨主售　不鬆、價乏變化、猶屬定局、繼開百念一元、百二十元、</p>
<p>糯米飯担與糕誧等零星胃口、雖續不暢、惟以　前市面運朝甩低、貨主復從而堅守、市貨廖落、市　續平行情未有上落、繼開香港高團粒元百四十四五元、長粒元百十二三元、次至百十元、懦茶特別百零六七元、中决百零三四元、國元高自百二十元、决至百十六元、</p>
<h3>麵粉囤戶　躍躍欲試</h3>
<p>洋粉市況、初平後緊、上午開盤因本客銷化、動而不暢、兼米市不脫徘徊、人心難於興奮、囤戶均懷審慎、各貨售價均告平穩、惟後市突然趨緊、蓋新麥來源、尚多問題、及油豆苞米漲風中、本客囤戶復呈活躍、金龍粉初開廿九元三角至三角半、後市見昂至廿九元五角至七角、砲台粉亦由三十元零二三角昂至三十元八角、尚有財神粉廿九元二角、飛剪牌廿八元八角、成交共有二萬餘包、市面已入步挺中、</p>
<p>新小麥來源仍寂華商方面、旣被禁阻、巳無　購買、惟有日商　鑫廠續有拋進、乃與糧商合作辦理、售價仍在四十元左右、故本年新麥上市、悉數操於某方手中、</p>
<h3>雜糧　餅巿已成尾聲　行情江河日下</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市面、祇剩六月下期貨叫囂市上、其他巳過期無市、現餅交易寂箕、共開肥字餅三百片、價為十七元一角、致以期貨市氣、一蹶不振、且謠傳統制黃豆搬出空氣米能徵實、良為多頭慾焰之致命打擊、故行情似江河日下、比上週末挫跌四五角、共計成交牲記六月上棧單六月下交萬譜片、開十八元八角半至十八元七角、中遠復至十八元八角、再跌至十八元六角半收盤、豆油及花生油本街銷塲梢接、行情在貨戶扳售之下、續升一二元左右、做關大連豆油九十桶、價詳市價欄、漢口豆油五十桶、膠州生油一百件、烟臺生油五十件、又聽裝四百聽、靑島生油一百桶、江北生油二十桶、今日有豆子二百三十包、豆餅一千片、芝蔴三百三十包、均運香港、</p>
<h3>證劵　債巿盤旋　實業股續告上漲</h3>
<p>公債暗盤　昨市略有盤旋狀況、空方一再壓迫、而行市並不趨跌、觀四十一號積記中孚銀行及信孚不斷乘低吸收、恐行市不易回小、消息方面、極為良好、美國擬以十萬萬美元軍火援助中國、更以相當之現金、裨中國維持外匯、全國人心、為之震奮、前途漸露曙光、昨上午四十一號信孚聯益恒孚買進、以四十一號為多、裕興潤利鑫　益昌賣出、以裕興為多、行市比較略疲、午後四十一號及信孚聯益　續買進、信昌益昌及協康補空及翻多、裕興繼續賣出、潤利潤德亦有拋售、同康同順壓小市價、但行市反有加高、結果高低互見一二角、成交的一白八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電公司股二百股、價為七元九角半、</p>

<h3>中國在遠東苦鬬　實為美國而作戰　美朝野情緒有極大轉變　認為竭力援華始足自救</h3>
<p>二金山特的通訊、遠東美僑、旅居中國或上本者、近撤退回美　、最　見到各　之一、厥為美國輿情對於遠東允其是日本、已有激變、蓋今日之美人、對遠　事件、所知遠　前為詳、而表更大之　切、故罔不用甚强硬措辭痛斥日本在中國與對南方之行動、及其對軸心國之關係、</p>
<p>明瞭中國　作戰意義</p>
<p>若千返此之美僑　、兩載前、美國人民認日本侵略中國為頗可扼腕之不幸事件、但以為日方侵略及局都事件、與美國並無影響、故僅表同情於中國、而不明瞭中國作戰之性質、今此彼等從東方撒退抵美、忽見美國對於中日事件、有此堅固之情緒、頗為震異、</p>
<p>美國利益　感受威脅</p>
<p>關於今日美人之態度有數點可述、（一）美國之命運實繫於太平洋、凡擾亂太平洋情勞者、乃直接威脅美國利益、（二）今可確認日本為對太平洋區和平與繁榮之威脅、易言之、美國復不能信賴日本之友誼、（三）中國實在東方為美國而戰、與英國在西方為美國而戰、確無二致、故美國應就可能範國、不僅以食物·卡車。與醫物援助之、更應以飛機·大砲·軍火與坦克車等戰具接濟之、</p>
<p>軍火金錢　源源接濟</p>
<p>撤退之美僑並提及羅斯福總統與威爾基兩要人、與許多政治家。商人·暨教育家所發之言論、內述美國須以信用放款與軍火供給中國、並使華國成為與侵略相搏戰的各「民治國之兵工廠」、據稱、此非僅暫時的政策、但將直接引起美國朝野在東方與太平洋中更大的關懷與活動、本年及今後太平洋之和平安穩、必為美或所殷殷關注者、此種具體化情緒、對於中美兩國日後之合作、具有重大意義、</p>
<p>人民要求　完全禁運</p>
<p>數年前、以美日有開戰可能為言者、曾被斥為唯武好戰之流、時至今日、美國人民已嚴重討論美日戰爭是吾必不可免、故各方對日禁運之要求、有增無已、現美國多種貨物、業已類似禁運、其目的在對付日本、毫無疑義、但美國民意、已有完全禁運之要求、此種情緒、隨地可見、如新聞影片映日軍官在越南或日機轟炸重慶時、觀衆咸發輕蔑之噓聲、即其一例、</p>
<p>創立國際　親善合作</p>
<p>斯丹福大學校長魏爾堡曰、在太平洋區中、人類終止　爭侵略、而創國際親　合作的新時代之最後大　會存焉、太平洋畔各國之學府、人才輩出、盼其能獲新的諒解與觀點、</p>

<h3>總統輪七艘受徵用　昨晨正式宣布　各輪完成航程即行移交　另調十二輪接駛各航綫</h3>
<p>歐戰擴張以後、美國決意　助民治國家抵抗侵略、過去對中英物質之援助已見實行、近美將實現護航、故對德義軸心之形勢、允形惡化、美政府微用商輪、助英運輸、組織航務委員會、逐漸付諸實行、</p>
<p>七輪應征　正式宣佈</p>
<p>昨據美國總統輪船公司上海分公司、正式宣佈、昨晨接舊金山總行電吿、現在行駛遠東太平洋舫綫之郵船搭虎脫　統號、克利扶倫總統號·柯立芝總統號·批亞士總統號·世界班新船傑克遜總統號海士總統號·亞担士總統號等郵船七艘、已經徵發</p>
<p>日本各埠　回程不停</p>
<p>現在在航程中之柯立芝總統號、現由小呂宋回程、本星期四日到滬、翌日即回美、日本神戶橫濱均不停靠、直駛檀查山而至舊金山、移交政府、批亞士總統號、於本月初由舊金山開出、預計本週六到埠、搭虎脫總新號、亦已於前日自舊金山東來、的下月一日到滬、二輪到滬後、是否即返美、或仍依照　航程赴香港小呂宋、現尙　決定、</p>
<p>世界班輪　回航移交</p>
<p>至世界班在航途中者、傑克遜總統號、係本月十日過滬赴南洋各埠、經孟買轉道好望角、的下月底返美、各輪完成一决航務、回美即移交航務委員會、該公司七輪被徵調後、對航務上亦已議定辦法、昨日亦同時正式宣佈、</p>
<p>調十二輪　接替航務</p>
<p>另調泰來總統號（譯音）·麥迪遜總統號　格蘭總統號·哈立遜總統號·孟　總統號·茄菲爾總統號·范　倫總統號·卜克總統號·白却南總統號（譯音）·約翰遜總統號·戴勒總統譯音、號·菲爾摩總統號·等十二艘、其中四艘、本市從　來過、其餘八艘中、新舊船均有、聞另有貨船數艘參加、惟各軌船期尚未排定、嗣後中美航　、當無影響、</p>

<h3>英國積極援華　促進兩國合作　擴大援華宣傳朝野響應　募集捐款紀念中國作戰　英援華會秘書烏德曼來函報告工作</h3>
<p>英國按華會總秘書洛　島德曼、最近致函中國某救國團體、除　述英倫所受之轟炸情形、確言英國民意之堅强外、並報吿該會援華工作狀況、該會乃英國範圍最廣大之援華團體、會員分佈全國、朝野人士、均有參加、因此有利中國之與論、常因該會之工作而造成、該會會員除加强本身之聯繫外、時多三五成羣、向外淮行宣傳、而以對於議會議員及外交官員之聯絡、允為成功、因之英國國策之決定、亦多少受此種援華空氣之影饗、</p>
<p>籌備中國　作戰紀念</p>
<p>該會目前正在籌備中國作戰四年力爭自由之大規模紀念、屆時印發「四年抗建」小冊數十萬本、詳述中國作戰期中之發展及其原有力量之特殊進步、以促進英國人民普遍之對華認識、並於七月十七日舉行「一碗飯要會」以籌募中國戰災人民之救濟經費、刻在葡京之駐央大使顧維鈞傳士、屆時將主席此一盛會、英國各處、亦將舉行紀念會議、使英國民衆了解中國在解放世界免遭軸心奴役之共同奮鬥中、業巳擔任及現正擔任之工作、援華會主席李期道威爾勳爵特在孟却期德導報發表一文、力申募款救濟中國境內之戰災而喚醒英人對於中國作戰努力、成為世界自由三大支柱之一之重要、並謂在過去數月內已有數百人遵行援傘會所發起之途徑、援華會已於助組織一工業機關、使英國援助與中國工業合作社之工作互相聯襲、</p>
<h3>總理廣州蒙難　各界沉默紀念　總理應變精神應資效法　繼續推行節儲救難運動</h3>

<h3>工業科對商務糾紛　調解原則　須勞方接受解雇</h3>
<p>商務印畫館勞資糾紛、遷延巳近兩月、尚未解決、日前勞方為謀打開僵局進行談判起見、經同人聯合委員會議決條件六項、向工部局工業科正式提出、轉達資方、據香港覆電、僅允將不續約優待金改為不滿七個月者袖足七個月、對其他要求、一概拒絕、而工部局工業科又復表示、除非勞方能接受</p>
<p>解雇原則</p>
<p>願出任調解、否則將中止調解、勞方為謀得直接交涉機會起見、經第三决會議決議通過、自動將原提條件六條先提出第一條、經出工部局工業科轉達、作間接交涉、其他五條、決不放棄原議、準備於打開談判之門時、直接向資方交涉、暫作時間上之保留、昨日上午、至工業科聽取消息、當由顧炳元發表資方轉交之香港第</p>
<p>二次覆電</p>
<p>對不續約優待金改為不滿八個月補足八個月、其餘仍一併拒絕、經代表等研究電文、復認為含糊取巧、所謂不滿八個月者補足八個月、換言之、最低薪金之同人、總計祇得四百十六元而已、七十元以上之同人、實毫無所得與原提相差太遠、當堅決表示不接受、並請將此意轉達資方、下午復至工業科聽取回音、結果資方仍</p>
<p>堅持原議</p>
<p>毫無變更、未得要領、現會方認為本會已認痛而將條件分批提出、原冀促使直接談判、不料資方將僅有之第一條大打折扣、談判前途殊為暗淡、聞勞方將於今日上午、再度召開會議、研究公司電文、決定今後方針、</p>

<p>影院用電　上月已减</p>
<p>各電影院之電力供給、上月已減少四分之一、頃叉接上海電力公司通知、略謂「若有必要、將隨時減少電力四分之三、」此項嚴竣辦法、或將小發勢吿、卽予實行、則電影院處境當極困難、因電力若減四分之三、電影院　日僅能放映一塲、所得不敷開支、而影片商或亦不願在此情況下映其影片也、果爾、電影院惟有完全停閉之途、</p>
<p>昨夜會議　將提建議</p>
<p>各院經營此業、皆投巨資、雇員頗多、公衆亦須藉此遣睱、故電力若再减少、實難辦理、各院　持人今夜集議時、諒將建議致函工部局與上海電力公司、俾能對此問題、獲得切實決定辦法、</p>

<h3>美凍結德義資金後　滬巿塲受波動　惟經過一剎那復趨穩定　德義僑民有受影響可能</h3>
<p>美國頒布凍結德義在美資金之新令、昨（十六日）晨使本市商界頗感波動、允以華商人為最、惟歷時短促、市塲上最初之感覺、為美國又頒凍結令、巳加重遠東在美資金亦被凍結的威脅之嚴重性、結果滙市開盤甚堅挺、股市亦呈顯著之變化、</p>
<p>凍結限於　歐洲各國</p>
<p>商界方面再加考量後、頗以美國新凍結令僅限於歐洲各國為慰、各界批語為華盛頓政府似不擬凍結中日兩國在美資金、否則華盛頓方面大可乘頒此反德命令之時、將遠東在美資金亦包括於內也、市塲趨勢遂立轉、美滙滙率五元四六二五、以至五元四三七五時、（美金一元的合法幣一八元三九）各銀行大量買進、旋滙率趨鬆、午後美滙巳恢復星期六日五元三七五之墓本滙率、（美金一元合十八元六一）</p>
<p>滬巿今午　可得確訊</p>
<p>股票趨勢則轉堅、股票價漸步高漲、午刻會德豐股票率先抬價稍逾九十八元、股市信心穩定、不受擾亂、商品市塲最初價格趨跌、旋亦復堅、關於美國凍結令、本市美國各銀行尚未接紐的總行訓令、蓋凍結令係紐的上週商業結東後發出者、非至令日復市、各總行不能發出訓令、故料此項訓令、今日（十七日）午刻始抵上海、美國頒此凍結令、當然將便德義人民存入本市美銀行之美元、遭受若干程度之影響、甚餘軸心國人民在其他銀行所存美元、亦有受其影響之可能、惟此輩德義人民似早已採取充份防範、故美國凍結令、對於上海余融與一般商務、未必有何重大影響、</p>

<h3>日浪人橫行不法　四十七名被解回國　均係冒充憲隊各種名義　被害人損失達數十萬元</h3>
<p>據日文上海每日新聞記載稱、最近各方面有冒充日本憲兵、憲兵隊密探、翻譯或以憲兵隊為背景、實行恐嚇詐財擄人勒贖吃白食行刦等種種之犯人、極為活躍、致使一般在華善良日人及中國人民受害者甚多、日憲兵隊當局、以此舉有碍日軍信譽、故對於此種罪犯極力檢舉、並予以斷然處分、自本年一月至四月間、被勒令同國者達四十七名之多、被害人損失總值在法幣三十萬元以上、軍票的為十五萬兀、茲特列舉三事、以概其餘、</p>
<p>探人隱秘　恐嚇詐財</p>
<p>虬江路華盛頓里仲買業園田倉造化名、（年三十八歲）因聞知某商人自內地秘運金塊來滬、遂胃充憲兵隊、向其恐嚇、索詐運動費二千元、當時取得一千零八十元、其後某商人因密運金塊被捕、經憲兵隊檢舉、園田復對其家屬聲稱、可運動釋放、因而詐取二百五十元、五月初旬、經憲兵隊偵悉、乃予以檢舉、</p>
<p>假名歛錢　揮霍無度</p>
<p>嘉興路二三五號大內政治化名、（三十五歲）去年十一月中旬、因憲兵隊之命、取得公其租界糞尿汲取權、遂藉名詐得八萬一千元、完全消費於游戲塲所、至本年三月、經憲兵隊查明檢舉、</p>
<p>勾結華人　擄架勒贖</p>
<p>施高塔路恒豐里　　號貿易商後藤兼次化名、（二十九歲）與華籍工人方志財二人勾結、於本年三月四五兩日、詐稱憲兵隊、前往華人經營之耶德爾（譯音）工廠、偽稱該廠製品不良、將該工廠職員二人捕去、加以不法監禁、要求以五千元往贖、事為憲兵隊所聞、即予檢舉、故所求贖金、並未獲得、此外尚有其他事件甚多、故當局希望中日一般人士、加以注意、</p>
<p>日本當局　發表談話</p>
<p>自上述各案發生後、憲兵隊為防患未然計、除一方極方予以取締外、同時希望一般市民與常局協力合作、十五日午後、日當局並發表談話如左、「最近當地時常發生　人冒充憲兵密探翻譯或以憲兵隊為背景、實行　種不法事件、此種　為、實有碍日軍名譽、甚感遺憾、此等犯人中、有日本人、亦有中國人、彼等利用被害者之弱點、以遂其欲、一般市民、因自私自利、乃為彼等奸言所播弄、故為防患未然計、希望一般市民、應予注意、最好能與憲兵隊時常取得述絡、倘有上述事件發生、覺其舉動不妥時、即行通知憲兵隊、不必予以金錢、且日方憲兵、不論穿制服或便衣、均持有勤務證、其身分固極明瞭也、」</p>

<h3>夏季畫廊巡禮</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>一個晴朗的下午，我懷了欣奮的心，跨進了靜安寺路西人靑年會，登二樓，已有許多參觀者先我而至了。簽了名，在張先生得　弟子吳元一小姐招待下，我飽覽了張氏及其弟子們的作品。</p>
<p>張先生的作品，吳小姐說，其中一部分已為各界人仕所藏，此决借來展覽的。總計張先生的作品，有油畫，雕刻，水彩畫，鉛畫等，茲將記得的分別述之。遺珠當然不免，好在畫展至十九日始止，讀者們好細細地欣賞。</p>
<p>油畫，首先映入眼簾的，是一幅巨型油畫「惻隱之心」，遠遠望去，竟不辨參觀者與畫中人，母怪好多人擁在晝前不肯離去。「遺民」亦為張氏得意之作，另一張是「未完成的創作」，晝中人携妻子兒女，背負包裹，形色倉皇憔悴，在屍橫遍野中亡命，後向房屋隱的中火光燭天，那一種恐怖情景，不由人鈎起一種特殊感覺。再有一幅引人注意的為「兵退前夕」張先生在外國時的作品，有「聖殿靈光」，「冷巷」，等令人冰思不已，靜物有「醇酒美人」，寓意深遠，警惕世人</p>
<p>水彩畫中有好幾幅是張先生在羅馬時的作品，如「古堡夕照」，「藝術薈萃處」，「古國遺物」等，古色古香，另有一種異國情調，際此世事瞬息萬變之今日，這幾張畫當然更有價值了。靜物有「醉蟹」等，畫來逼肖，嗜此物者見之，準叫他華涎三尺哩！</p>
<p>雕刻有天右先生及饒神父之像，鉛畫亦有多幀。</p>
<p>最後至張先生高足作品之一部去，則有吳元一小姐之木炭索描　替同　畫像，還有油畫等，唐柱君之雕刻，天然君之鉛畫，及孟慕頤，劉旭滄，劉舜華諸君之精彩作品，眞所謂玲琅滿目，美不勝收，飽覽之餘，還帶回彩色精印油印畫二張。</p>
<p>據說張先生不很願意畫兩張完全相同的作品，所以後來定購的，均抱向隅之憾，有一位外國太太連選三張，但均已為捷足者先定，故嘆息不已。</p>
<p>我與吳小姐握別時，為五時半，斯時適為大光明電影院第二塲開映時，但是靑年會的樓梯上，參觀的人還是絡繹不絕的上來，可見張先生作品感人之深了！</p>

<h3>戰爭使兒童罪案激增</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>據英國內政部的調查，一　四一年一二三四月份中，英國孩童犯罪的案件，要比上年同時增加有百分之五十。關於這一點，最近雖沒有詳實的統計，但確信數目決不會減少。因為戰事的關係，孩子們甜蜜的家，在轟炸下被摧毀了，他們的變親，都被炸死了，或者離開了，以致故養無人，流離失所，犯罪的數目，在這種情形之下，豈有不增加之理。</p>
<p>英政府補救的辦法，就是叫學校照常上課，決不可仟意停頓；之外，他們也知道單叫孩子們死讀書是不會得到好結果的，所以又叫各地方機關儘可能地多設兒童公園，公共游戲塲與兒童俱樂部，好使他們在課餘飯後，仍能夠得到身心上發展的機會。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>高爾基的膽量與苦學</h3>
<p>— 蘆鶴</p>
<p>有决，高爾基　三四個同伴在一處，聽一個老婦人講着獵人加列寗的故事，她說：：「加列寗是個白髮老人，有一雙可怕的眼睛，死得還不久，棺材也不曾埋葬在地下，每夜朦朧地好像老人從棺材裏起來，在墳墓間行走，因為他做過魔術家。」她這　說着的時候，同伴中有一個人斥她說謊，而老婦人的兒子佛樓克來了，就說道：「你能夜間睡在那裹嗎？你要是躺在墳墓上睡到天亮，我就給你二十戈皮。」於是這個同伴怯怯地赧顏了，退到角落裹去。佛樓克很自滿地發笑了，別的朋友也都慢慢地走開。佛樓克就更揶揄着說：「你到那裹去，膽小鬼！起初以為你們是街上的戰士，原來你們這些都是老鼠！」這時，高爾基聽得不服氣，心裹實在忍不住了，他的個性是剛强的，聽了這種揶揄，覺得十分羞辱，他發氣地走到佛樓克面前，大聲地說：「給我個盧布，我就去。」他們講好條件，要高爾基在墳墓上躺到天亮，或坐到天亮不能離開去。如果棺材動搖起來，加列　老人復活起來了，也不許離開。跳到　上，就算輸了於是高爾基這夜就到墳上去，拿了一條毯子睡下。佛樓克同他的朋友把亂石拋去，想威嚇他，但被他識破了，絲毫不以為奇怪。到了天明，大家問他：「有沒有什麽奇異？」他答道：「有什麽　異！」他幼時的膽識，有些是大人們所不及的。</p>
<p>高爾基住在他的主人圖案師家中，很然心讀書。當他的主人們睡了，才輕輕地起來讀書，走向窗前，月光直射到窗上，但細小的印刷物，他的目力不夠，看不清楚。他稍想了想，就從棚上拿下　個銅手鍋，月光由它反射到書本上，更加糢糊不明，比沒有用時要壞一些。那時，他再跑到店內，在神像前燈光下站着，把書閱讀。可是疲倦後，在店內打盹，被他老中母察覺，毒打到他的身上金紅了。有時夜裹燃着蠟燭，努力讀書奮發用功，但給那年老的女主人知道了，就　把畫扯破。他用盡了種種巧妙的方法，沒有蠟燭，不能用錢去買，他只得把燭台上的殘蠟取下，盛在鐵罐裹，再倒人些燈油，裝了燈心，火光搖搖欲熄，雖然這樣不方便，可是就這樣耐苦地讀了許多書。這眞和我國的『囊螢』『映雪』『懸樑刺股』『鑿壁取光』『不窺舍園』中西媲美。無怪他終於成為一代的大文豪咧！</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>他是病死的</h3>
<p>— 夏蔭</p>
<p>早晨，五點鐘就開工了。女工們零星地跑進工廠來。她們都愁苦着臉，睜着疲乏和飢餓的眼睛，在廣闊的工作廠裹沒精打彩地工作着。</p>
<p>照例，我踱進了辦公處頭腦就不自主地昏暈起來。工作是多麼的繁重啊！從前廠裹有七個會計工作人員，後來廠方為了節省開支，現在就只有三個了。一倘是主任先生，根本不做事的；另一個將　六十歲的和廠方有特殊關係的老人，什麽都要我幫他做的。我簡直在做整個的會計工作啦。</p>
<p>開工不久，工塲裹傳來了一陣譁叫，我立刻飛也似的跑了出去，聽到她們用同情和憐憫的聲音在細語：</p>
<p>「性命怕難　了！」</p>
<p>「可憐，一家四口都要靠他過活呢！」</p>
<p>原來第二號焙房的工人突然病倒了，已經被抬到醫院裹去，症家很是兇險。</p>
<p>「這人本來身體很强壯，自從到焙房工作　，就一天一天的瘦弱下去，面孔變得萎黃可怕。家裏…—」她們又在訴說了。</p>
<p>我不忍再聽下去，嘆了一口氣，悄悄地走開了。是的，一個人不諭春夏秋冬，每天日夜地在高溫的培房中勞苦地工作，那兒會不悶死呢？我想着，我開始心痛起來。我的靑春的活力小是也逐漸地在消失嗎？</p>
<p>一會兒，傳來了意料得到的消息：人還沒有抬到醫院就死了。辦公處裹，經理和高級職員在商量：</p>
<p>「他是病死的，不關我們的事。」</p>
<p>「看他可憐，就給他十元錢收殮費吧！」</p>
<p>不平和憤怒，充滿了我的心頭。等我記上這筆收殮費　，我還得記上那些所謂一為公的開支：</p>
<p>「某先生請客費用一百元」</p>
<p>「某先生去港開銷五百元」</p>
<p>「某先生交際費二百元。」</p>
<p>我知道得很淸楚。他們那些開支完全為着個人的私事。開房間，上舞塲，玩　將，賭撲克，盡情地荒唐着，祇是瞞過經理吧了。可是對着不幸死去的工人，性命却比黃泥還賤。</p>
<p>「他是病死的，不關我們的事。」經埤的神氣活現的聲音，父在我耳邊響起來了。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的莊稼人</p>
<p>這並不是說他對於奶媽子本人，或他的一家已發生了什麼特殊關係，非把他們永遠留在起不可；實際上，這僅僅是一個單純的問題。因為人和人相處，不論父母兒女也罷，夫妻兄弟也罷，同事也罷，主僕也罷……，只要相處得特別久一些，便小免會產生出一種特殊的　感來，一旦聽到要分手，彼此的心裹，就多少要覺得空洞洞的不大好受。何況秋海棠本來原是一個多感的人？</p>
<p>他站在坑前，低下了頭，好半嚮不能說什麼話；小梅寳的一雙靈活的眸子，儘在他那一叢剪得很短很散亂的頭髮上打轉。</p>
<p>「爸爸，他們眞的要…！要回去嗎？寳寳個人在家裹……再也沒有淘！…淘伴了。媽媽又不回來……。」她說了這一句，便禁不住抽抽噎噎的哭起來了。</p>
<p>她這麽一哭，秋海棠的心裹便更亂得慌了。</p>
<p>他很想立刻走出去向王四和那奶媽子問一下，可是最近幾個月來，他們夫婦兩個臉上所表顯的情態，以及私下所透露的談話，都足以證明小梅寳方才說的一點是極有可能的，再去問他們有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>「好孩子，快睡吧！明天爸爸曾去問他們的。」勉强定了一定心神以後，他便竭力催促梅實安睡。</p>
<p>他自己就在屋子裹來來回回的走着，思潮的激蕩，使他覺得比暈船還難受；其實在這些起伏不定的思潮中間，最有力的一股主潮，還是他幾年來時刻不忘的　湘綺。</p>
<p>這幾年來，他對於任何人都說梅寳的媽已在天津死了，知道她沒有死，而且還知道他時刻在想念她的，就祇梅寳和那個奶媽子。（一三四）</p>

<h3>擾人淸夢的喇叭聲</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>受過　事訓練的人，人概都有一種感覺，以為　討厭而難於習慣的一件事，就是老淸早聽見晨號　嗚，就得起身。這時天還木亮，四顧茫茫，如果是在冬天，更是寒風刺骨，令人難受。這種難關，就是資格最老的兵士，也覺得不客易對付。有時候　至誤認喇叭聲為好夢的一部份，昏昏沉沉繼續睡下去。</p>
<p>美國南卡洛萊那州傑　遜要塞軍營中的號手，最近靈機一動，忽然計上心來，發明在擴音機上吹　號，使營中的兵士都能一躍而起。據他發覺，叫吃飯的軍號，就不必吹得那麽響啦。</p>
<h3>求偶奇俗</h3>
<p>— 增修</p>
<p>南斯拉夫族的女子，有一種求偶的奇異風俗，眞可謂匪夷所思。她們從她們的愛人走過而留下脚印的地方，掘起一塊泥土，放在一隻花盆中。然後她們在那隻花盆中，種一枝金盞草—她們以為這種植物永遠不會枯萎。當金盞草的金色花朵逐漸生長永不萎謝的時候，她們的愛人的愛苗」也逐漸生長，永不萎謝。愛人走過的地方的泥土，會促成一對一對的佳耦，月下老人，自然應該退避三舍了。</p>

<p>如果說我們去看這個戲，完金是為了找尋趣味與刺激，那末你正會非常失望的，因為「古剎驚夢」的故事很簡單，她沒有趣味，亦無刺激，本來阿父夏莫洛夫的原意，只是在借着些題材，作為譜製樂曲的一個軀幹；然而站在戲劇的最高峯，用藝術的眼光去欣賞時，她給你的好處太多了，使你看過以後，腦海裏仍是徘徊着劇中人的輪廓，他們笑，哭，恨，怒，那就彷彿你自己在如此表演，那就彷彿你最親切的千千萬萬的朋友在如此表演。</p>
<p>第一幕，是個古剎的佈景，旁坐老和尚，中有千手觀音。劇情是小姐慧運，帶着個婢女，出來參拜觀音。第二幕，隸蓮夢見　鬼，又見二求婚者先後與魔十決鬥，結果匹勇（浮滑的少年）敗，敏勇（忠誠的少年）勝。第三幕在一花園內，許多人以演技慶賀敏勇的勝利，於是有情人終成眷屬。</p>
<p>張美琳飾慧蓮，無論身　，台步，表情，都很柔美。崔艷芳領導的千手觀音，以五人排成一行，做出各種不同的手姿勢，純熟之至。徐甫庭的魔王，猙獰的扮相，惡極！四魔鬼的手脚上，並劃有黑痕，這象徵魔鬼的恐怖，恰到好處。匹勇的弄棍，快而急，急而快，眞是但看棍花，不見人影」。敏勇的耍刀，有力，有功夫，頗不平凡。此外飾志和尚的張連奎，以及飾小婢的馬秀容和曹麗霞等，也都費力。</p>
<p>我們值得一提的是，據說那些演員們在剛開始訓練的時候，旣不通導演的語　，又不懂西樂的節拍，只靠着喊「一二三四」，依决研習，現在經過七月的時間，和觀衆們見面了，他們一舉一動，都是　着節拍走的，並且隨了音樂的高低，能　達出臉部，手部，脚部，各方面的動作，而表示「喜，怒，哀，樂。」在音樂伴奏時，你會聽到勇敢的，懦弱的，悲涼的，凄厲的各種聲音，這聲音，似乎正獲自演員們的脚尖，——輕鬆而又活潑。第二幕的梵啞鈴高音，和着小喇叭的軟軟地嗚咽，使我的情感按捺不住了，我懷疑此刻是處身於　一世界中了。</p>
<p>以音樂的節奏代替語言，拿動作的表情說明故事，這是中國舞劇的一個　點。這個戲，或者並不是一般淺薄的找尋趣味與刺激的觀衆所能接受的。然而我却敬佩阿父及莫洛夫的埋頭苦幹的精神，允其他對於發揚中國古代的藝術，已盡了最大的努力。</p>

<h3>Opening of the National Financial Conference; Over Two Hundred Representatives Attend, Kong Xiangxi Presides</h3>
<p>The Third National Financial Conference in Chongqing opened today, presided over by Finance Minister Kong. Two hundred and thirty representatives attended, including the heads of finance departments from twenty provinces. The agenda includes proposals for central government collection of land tax, grain as a substitute for currency in tax payments, adjustments to the financial relationship between the central and local governments, funding for the establishment of a new county system, and adjustments to local taxes. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The National Financial Conference opened here this morning. Over two hundred and fifty representatives from twenty provinces attended. The conference is chaired by Kong Xiangxi, Deputy Executive Yuan President and concurrently Minister of Finance. (June 16th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi's Opening Remarks</p>

<h3>American Property in Chongqing Destroyed; Grew Lodges Strong Protest with Japanese Foreign Minister; British Ambassador to Japan Visits Ohashi to Protest Bombing of British Embassy in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo: U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has lodged a strong protest with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka regarding the bombing yesterday by Japanese aircraft in Chongqing of the U.S. Embassy Chancellery, the U.S. Army Attaché Office, the U.S. Embassy, and the Standard Oil Company. Grew issued the protest after receiving a detailed report from U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, on the damage inflicted on American property in Chongqing by Japanese aircraft. Gauss's report stated that no Americans were killed or injured in the Japanese air raid on Chongqing yesterday. However, a bomb landed within a few feet of the new U.S. Army Attaché Office, located between the U.S. Embassy and the American warship "Tutilla" berthed in the river. The U.S. Army Attaché Office was destroyed and the U.S. Embassy, the American warship "Tutilla," and the American Naval Bar were lightly damaged. A poorly constructed air raid shelter near the U.S. Embassy was hit, killing over thirty Chinese. Five bombs landed within three hundred yards of the U.S. Ambassador and the "Tutilla," one of which landed within fifty yards of the U.S. Embassy air raid shelter. It is believed that Ambassador Gauss was in the air raid shelter during the attack, although Gauss's report did not mention this. The Chancellery and the U.S. Ambassador's residence were damaged by the violent tremors and flying debris. The Standard Oil Company was also damaged. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It has been learned today that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Ohashi, Director-General of the Japanese Foreign Office, on Saturday to protest the recent bombing of the British Embassy in Chongqing by Japanese aircraft. It is understood that the British Ambassador pointed out that the markings on the roof of the British Embassy clearly indicated that it was British official property. During the recent Japanese air raid on Chongqing, six bombs landed within the British Embassy compound, causing significant damage. The buildings of the British Embassy in Chongqing were painted a distinctive yellow color for identification purposes. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: American property suffered the most damage during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing on the 15th. In addition to the destruction of the U.S. Embassy Military Attaché Office and the damage to the gunboat "Tutilla" from bomb fragments, it has been confirmed that the Ambassador's office and the Standard Oil Company office were also damaged. The company stored supplies for the U.S. Navy. (June 16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Standard Oil Company's warehouse on the south bank of Chongqing was also damaged during yesterday's Japanese air raid. It is understood that the company is considering requesting compensation from the Japanese government. The warehouse is where the American naval bar is located. A bomb exploded just thirty yards from the warehouse, shattering windows and causing a great deal of plaster to fall. The captain of the American warship "Tutilla" hosted American reporters last night, stating that there was no damage to the ship. After dinner, a movie was shown. The ship was affected by the tremors and sustained minimal damage. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Change in Central Broadcasting Time, Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Broadcasting Station has revised its broadcasting schedule starting on the 16th of this month. The midday programs will begin at 6:00 AM. In addition to news reports, the station will add flag-raising ceremonies, calisthenics, and stories of martyrs. The new programs, the recorded news from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM, and the programs from 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM will be broadcast as usual. (June 16th dispatch)We await deliberation and candid discussion, gathering wisdom and benefiting from all ideas. As this conference opens, I extend my sincere welcome and appreciation. The Ministry convened the First National Financial Conference in July of the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. At that time, the North and South had just been unified, and political tutelage was urgently needed. Financial reorganization was imperative. Furthermore, due to the implementation of tariff autonomy, which had been initially recognized by the U.S. government, and to establish international credibility and reduce the burden on the people, we convened the First National Financial Conference to resolve the abolition of likin [internal transit tax]. However, due to successive disturbances, frequent famines, financial exhaustion, and economic decline, exacerbated by the global economic panic and the sharp increase in trade deficits, farmers and merchants suffered, and both the central and local governments were in dire straits. Recognizing that finance is the lifeblood of the nation, and that the prosperity or decline of the national economy is tied to the nation's tax revenue, I proposed to the Fourth Plenary Session in January of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] to implement the reorganization of land taxes and reduce surcharges in order to alleviate the people's burden and promote economic recovery. In May of the same year, the Second National Financial Conference was convened with the main objectives of (1) abolishing arbitrary taxes and levies and alleviating the people's burden, (2) conducting land surveys and resolving land issues, (3) thoroughly reforming the tax system and reorganizing local tax revenues, and (4) establishing local budgets and emphasizing productive construction. The Ministry has implemented the resolutions within the realm of possibility. (To be continued) (June 16th dispatch)</p>

Looking at Sichuan Province alone, there are about 130 large rivers and 1,000 small rivers. The Ministry can use these rivers to irrigate rice paddies and increase rice production. The Ministry will make every effort to fully supply grain to the military and civilians and suppress hoarding. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Venting of Excess Capital</h3>
<p>Shanghai's finance can be described as extremely unrestrained today. Head office drafts rise above par, and remittance drafts have returned to rising above par from being at a discount. The strangeness of this situation is unparalleled. In reality, it is not surprising. Money is no different from other commodities. If it is put to good use, it becomes extremely powerful, seemingly invincible. But if it is not put to good use, then gold loses its luster and becomes as worthless as dirt. Therefore, the value of everything depends not only on supply and demand but also on calculation. If the calculation shows a profit, even something cheap is desirable. If the calculation shows no profit, what is the use of something expensive? Today's cash, head office drafts, and remittance drafts are all the same thing. Head office drafts are cash that can be obtained immediately, and remittance drafts are cash that has restrictions on withdrawal. Cash is the mother, and head office drafts and remittance drafts are the children. When children replace their mother, the mother must be at a discount to the children, and how can this not be strange? But analyzing it, it is nothing more than based on the calculation of people's hearts! In the past, it was impossible to obtain cash, so people turned to obtain it through intermediaries, willingly paying a discount of one or two hundred yuan to ensure they got it. Today, however, prices are extraordinarily high, and the transfer of funds is increasingly frequent and large. Cash has the hassle of being counted and the worry of being robbed. In addition, considering the differences in interest rates and the various restrictions, people naturally choose to give up what is difficult and take what is easy, valuing profit over goods. As a result, they inevitably emphasize negotiable instruments. Negotiable instruments are safer, less dangerous, facilitate transfers, save procedures, and save time. This is the reason for rising above par, and cash has lost its luster.</p>
<p>However, cash will ultimately be cash. One day when it contracts, who knows if the discount will not immediately return. Today, we are suffering from the harm of excess. The harm of excess means that excess capital is rampant. Excess capital has its own ways to vent. In the world of legal tender, banknotes and government bonds can be regarded as equivalent. Government bonds can be regarded as wholesale banknotes, and banknotes can be regarded as retail government bonds. If there are too many banknotes, government bonds can be used to absorb them. If there are too few banknotes, they can be released from government bonds. This is the way to balance the ebb and flow of currency. Not only that, with the current low interest rates on deposits and the numerous restrictions on storing head office drafts, how can the free circulation of government bonds, calculated at market prices, not be even more profitable? Government bonds can be regarded as banknotes with interest. However, those who like to speculate believe that although the interest on government bonds is substantial, compared to the profits from hoarding and speculation, which can generate many times the capital, it is insignificant and not worth considering. They do not consider that where there is great profit, there is also great harm. Hoarding and speculation can sometimes lead to great wealth, but they can also lead to the complete loss of one's assets. There is nothing that does not come with both advantages and disadvantages. Government bonds, with their unbreakable creditworthiness, may not offer great profits, but they also do not involve great harm. The Classic of Filial Piety says, "Full but not overflowing, so one can long maintain wealth." Investing in government bonds is the way to achieve fullness without overflowing.</p>
<p>If one is determined to become very rich, it cannot be achieved through speculation. What is gained through speculation is like gambling, "coming in with the waves and going out with the waves," and is difficult to sustain. If one is willing to take great risks in the hope of obtaining great wealth, then why not use the capital for hoarding and speculation to reclaim wasteland, develop treasures, build great undertakings, and establish large properties? The great tycoons of Europe and America, who have dominated the world and achieved prominence, all possessed this entrepreneurial spirit and were good at using their wealth. They used not only their own wealth but also the wealth of the masses. They were not only capable with their own talents and efforts but also gathered the strength of the masses. As a result, no matter how many obstacles they faced or how many dangers they braved, nothing was impossible, no achievement was impossible, and wealth was inevitably accumulated. This is what is meant by seizing the great opportunities of the world, benefiting the country, benefiting the people, benefiting oneself, benefiting others, and leaving a legacy of endless benefits. As for hoarding and speculation, they only know how to exploit the lives of the masses to enrich themselves, harming others and benefiting oneself, without regard for the public. Once the situation changes and the market fluctuates, who knows if ruin will not be imminent? Therefore, those who possess great wealth should have foresight and vision. Today, in the southwest and northwest regions, the wilderness stretches far and wide, the mountains are stacked upon mountains, and the resources are abundant. Wealth is left lying on the ground. It can be said that the ground is full of gold, but it cannot be taken with a snap of the fingers! Therefore, the excess capital that is congested in Shanghai, causing harm due to its excess and having no way to vent, can take this opportunity to gather talent and capital, move capital inward, gain both security and great profits. The current difficulties are only temporary. Moreover, the southwest and northwest are no longer what they used to be. The construction of transportation networks is sufficient to aid the development of industry and commerce. Although the southeast is known as the area of wealth, it has been cultivated and inhabited for thousands of years, and the land's productivity may eventually be exhausted. The future development lies in what people have not previously paid attention to. Manage it, operate it, attract it, and transform rubble into gold. Bring excess capital into the right track. It all depends on people's efforts!</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Retaliating Against U.S. Asset Freeze; Will Take Similar Actions; Italy Already Investigating American Assets in Italy; Germany Will Implement Previously Drafted Confiscation Order</h3>
<p>Rome, June 16th (Associated Press): Premier Mussolini, in retaliation for the U.S. freezing Axis funds in the U.S., ordered the freezing of American assets this morning at 8:00 AM. As a result, American citizens throughout Italy are no longer able to withdraw their deposits from banks.</p>
<p>Rome, June 16th (Associated Press): One thousand American citizens residing in Rome were trying to withdraw deposits from banks today, as they had private funds in various banks. The reason they were trying to withdraw was that the Italian side recently announced that, after President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of German and Italian funds in the U.S., Italy would also retaliate against all American property within Italy. There are currently 5,000 American residents in Italy. It is generally predicted here that the American residents will suffer poverty as a result. An official Italian communique stated that the method of Italian retaliation, to put it plainly, is that whatever measures the U.S. takes against Italy, Italy will take the same measures against the U.S. Currently, an investigation into American property has begun in preparation for confiscation once the U.S. begins freezing Italian funds.</p>
<p>Washington, June 16th (Reuters): It has long been expected here that Italy would take retaliatory action by freezing American assets in Italy. Official circles have not yet issued criticisms, but it is generally believed that this move by Rome is mostly theoretical, as Italy's current monetary controls have already prevented Americans from withdrawing their investments in Italy. The same is true for Germany. It is estimated that American assets in Italy are worth US$143 million, and in Germany, they are worth US$427 million.</p>
<p>Berlin, June 16th (Associated Press): It is widely believed that the order, drafted by Germany more than two months ago, to confiscate American industries in Germany will be implemented immediately in retaliation for President Roosevelt's freezing of Axis funds in the U.S. It is understood that Germany drafted this plan previously, at the time the U.S. confiscated German ships in the U.S., as a means of retaliation, but then abandoned the original plan. It is widely believed that Germany will take retaliatory steps simultaneously with Italy. A spokesperson for authoritative circles refused to comment on this matter and also refused to estimate how much assets Germans have in the U.S.</p>
<p>Washington, June 16th (Associated Press): An official in the legal section of the Treasury Department said yesterday that President Roosevelt's freezing order and the accompanying registration of foreign property in the U.S. will also apply to the Philippines. Section 5 of the order states that the term "enemy country" means "the United States and any place subject to U.S. law."</p>
<p>Berlin, June 16th (Associated Press): German authoritative figures recently stated that the U.S. action of freezing German and Italian deposits is absolutely unjust and stated that German and Italian countermeasures are probably under consideration.</p>
<p>Axis Funds in the U.S. Have Been Evaded</p>
<p>New York, June 16th (Associated Press): It was stated here yesterday that it would be very difficult to accurately compile a register of Axis assets stored in the U.S. Wall Street believes that Axis funds have been cleverly evaded. The huge amount of funds in Swiss institutions is a clear example. Currently, Swiss deposits in the U.S. amount to a massive 1.5 billion, while German deposits are only 300 to 400 million. Some monetary experts believe that Germany and Italy have continued to transfer their frozen funds in recent weeks. Financial officials say that although they know that Swiss assets must include German and Italian investments, it is very difficult to separate German and Italian funds from Swiss assets specifically. They also predict that some other Axis funds have been used by merchants of other nationalities outside of Switzerland to engage in financial activities. Wall Street says that President Roosevelt's freezing of Axis funds can prevent the Axis from accumulating property in the U.S.</p>
<p>German Officials Refuse to Comment</p>
<p>Berlin, June 16th (International News Service): Authoritative sources here have refused to comment on President Roosevelt's order to freeze Axis assets in the U.S. German newspapers have not mentioned the order, as the newspapers and spokespersons are awaiting official instructions.</p>
<p>Japanese Response to U.S. Freezing of Funds</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 16th (Haitong Press): The "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun" today published a dispatch from its New York correspondent, stating that although the U.S. government "has not yet frozen" Japanese deposits in the U.S., this is not a gesture of goodwill from President Roosevelt to improve relations between Japan and the U.S. On the contrary, Japan must prepare for the tendency of the U.S. to increase economic and political pressure. In fact, U.S. authorities are already investigating Japanese property in the U.S.</p>
<p>Britain Expresses Great Welcome to This Move by the U.S.</p>
<p>London, June 16th (Associated Press): There was warm welcome here yesterday for President Roosevelt's freezing of Axis funds in the U.S., as it is believed that this move is a blow to Germany and Italy, and at the same time, it can protect the Western Hemisphere from being infiltrated by the Axis. London also interpreted President Roosevelt's measure as indicating that the U.S. is prepared to eliminate all German attempts in the Americas. The most immediate effect of freezing Axis funds is that the Axis can no longer engage in activities to disrupt the Western Hemisphere. At the same time, all free trade purchases of goods by the Axis around the world will be cut off as a result.</p>
<h3>U.S. Warmly Welcomes British Pilots</h3>
<p>London, June 16th (Reuters): The Air Ministry Information Office stated that a large number of British pilot trainees have arrived in the U.S. and have received a warm welcome. The U.S. has been entertaining them generously. Bands have been playing British and American songs and marches. The trainees will never forget this kind of hospitality.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Indies Parliament Opens; Governor-General Delivers Opening Address; Insisting on Not Providing the Enemy with Raw Materials</h3>
<p>United Press, Batavia, 16th Dispatch: The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies declared in the National Assembly today that Japan must understand that the Dutch East Indies cannot export raw materials to supply the Axis powers. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, in his address at the opening of the parliament, reviewed the economic negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, stating, "Japan must understand that the most fundamental concepts of our own interests and national responsibility compel us, at any cost, to prevent our exports from directly or indirectly supplying the enemy with urgently needed raw materials. This policy restricts our foreign activities and permits the export of certain raw materials, which is very clear and reasonable. Therefore, we can never consider changing our policy or not actively implementing it." The Governor-General also discussed the national defense plan and the progress of the war, and expressed hope that the Netherlands could be liberated through the victory of the Allied powers. The audience included Dutch, indigenous, and foreign diplomatic personnel.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 16th Dispatch: According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance of the Dutch East Indies today, the 1941 budget of the Dutch East Indies will be short by 136,700,000 guilders due to the cost of recruiting local indigenous troops and expanding the mechanization of the army, which has already cost 70 million guilders. Defense matters will be accelerated in the next fiscal year, such as expanding and strengthening the Surabaya naval base and increasing the deployment of fleets, all of which will be urgently undertaken. Since 1940, 500 million guilders have been spent on defense expenditures.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 16th Dispatch: At today's session of the People's Council of the Dutch East Indies for 1941, the Governor-General announced the possibility of political reform in the post-war status of the Dutch East Indies, stating that once the Netherlands regains its freedom, leading figures from all sectors of the country will request the King to grant political reforms to the Dutch East Indies to suit its significance as an important part of the Netherlands. The historical and constitutional ties between the various parts of the Netherlands have been strengthened by the war. The East Indies cannot produce war materials and strictly controls its exports to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. The East Indies has voluntarily contributed 10 million guilders to purchase aircraft.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 16th Dispatch: News that the Dutch in London received that the People's Council of the Dutch East Indies, meeting today, will discuss improving trade relations between China and the Dutch East Indies has attracted much attention here. The Central Daily News stated that this news is worthy of our attention, as it comes at a time when economic negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands have broken down. The relationship between China and the Dutch East Indies has a long history, and it is estimated that there are no fewer than 1.2 million Chinese living in the Dutch East Indies, who have contributed significantly to the development of the Dutch East Indies. Subsequently, due to the expansion of Japanese economic influence, trade relations between the two sides declined. Now that this issue has been raised for discussion in the Batavia Parliament, we hope that the Chinese government will pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association; Speech by Suetsugu; If the United States Actually Participates in the European War, Japan Should Also Prepare to Join the War</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th Dispatch: At the opening of the Central Cooperative Council of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in Tokyo today, General Suetsugu stated in his address that important issues are rapidly approaching, compelling Japan to make final decisions on the construction of new institutions in government, economics, domestic culture, and life, because international relations are quite tense, the China Incident needs to be resolved as soon as possible, and the United States is about to join the war. He then mentioned the establishment of the Tripartite Pact, stating that the pact was concluded in accordance with the Emperor's will and has become a union of three strong powers that is closely related to the new world order, and does not contain selfish or self-serving motives. Therefore, if the United States, out of its confidence and for the sake of honor, participates in the European War, Japan should also prepare to join the war. He again mentioned the South Seas issue, stating that the issue is a matter of life and death for Greater East Asia, and Japan certainly cannot acquiesce to its current status. He firmly believes that Japan will be the decisive factor in the global war. This is not an easy task for Japan, but the Japanese people will be forced to make extraordinary preparations, so the new institutions in all aspects of national activities must strive to be completed as soon as possible. The Central Cooperative Council is the core of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the driving force of the new national system. Today's first formal meeting was attended by 212 representatives from all sectors of the country, who will handle 242 issues, mostly related to the construction of new institutions in all aspects of national activities. Admiral Suetsugu, who once served as Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Fleet, is known by the Japanese as the builder of the modern Japanese fleet and is a prominent figure in the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th Dispatch: Former Prime Minister Konoe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, stated in his opening address at the Central Cooperative Council of the Association today that the international situation surrounding Japan is becoming increasingly tense, and the European war is expanding without end. This situation is sufficient to plunge the entire world into great chaos at any moment. In order to safely navigate this critical era and to reassure the Emperor, everyone should stand in their respective positions and fulfill their respective responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Rumors of a Serious Issue Brewing Between the Soviet Union and Germany; Tokyo and Vichy Are Both Involved; Soviets Refuse to Conclude a Military Alliance with Germany</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch: The diplomatic correspondent of the Observer stated that there is credible reason to believe that a more serious and far-reaching event than the mutual deployment of troops and preparedness is brewing between the Soviet Union and Germany. Tokyo and Vichy are both involved, with Tokyo being directly involved. Japan's motive is more anti-Soviet than pro-German. Moreover, Berlin may not know it, but Moscow is well aware of it. The Soviet Union is concerned that if the de facto Soviet-German military alliance is shown to Japan, Japan will not only be anti-Soviet but also anti-German, and may even seek a compromise with the United States. In view of this possibility, the Soviet Union has refused Berlin's request for a Soviet-German military alliance. Furthermore, Germany has resolved not to allow Japan to permanently possess the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator, which were formerly owned by Germany before the war and were entrusted to Japan by the League of Nations after the war. If a Soviet-German military alliance is established, the Soviet Union will support Germany's determination, which is also unacceptable to Japan. In Tokyo's view, the outbreak of war between the Soviet Union and Germany would be secretly welcomed, just as the Soviet Union views the war between Britain and Germany. However, if a Soviet-German alliance is established, Tokyo would truly be unable to avoid seeing it as a death knell for Japan's South Pacific ambitions. Therefore, Moscow's rejection of Berlin's diplomatic pressure is aided by Japan's activities in the Soviet Union. As for Vichy's indirect role in the current diplomatic situation, Vichy's recent note to London is, in effect, no different from the note issued by Germany. However, Vichy's attitude remains ambivalent, and the threat of Germany extracting French wealth from the European continent has now been greatly weakened, because France knows that within Germany's power, the punishment has been exhausted and there is nothing more to punish. Germany's pretense of not being involved in the Anglo-French dispute in Syria is a trick that deceives no one. The question now is whether Hitler can coerce Vichy to order the French Empire not to submit to General de Gaulle.</p>
<p>Germany Plans to Launch Attack After Autumn; Soviet Union Strengthens Military Power</p>
<p>United Press, Ankara, 16th Dispatch: Well-informed sources in neutral diplomatic circles here stated yesterday that a German attack on the Soviet Union is inevitable unless the Soviet Union agrees to help Germany with food to supply the Nazi-conquered areas of Europe. They also stated that military activities on both sides of the Soviet-German front are being actively carried out. Diplomats also said that Germany apparently believes it can destroy the Soviet army within six weeks, but hopes to launch the attack after the autumn harvest. It was also said that the German troops concentrated there are apparently ready to launch an offensive, unless the Soviet Union complies with all of Germany's demands for planting and supplies.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 16th Dispatch: The Soviet News Agency published an important editorial today, stating that the current situation has prompted the Soviet Union to strengthen its military and economic power in all aspects, and claiming that the Soviet Union can remove obstacles and achieve victory whether in fighting the enemy or in other areas. The original text is as follows: "The Bolshevik Party encourages countless people to complete their tasks. Whether it is fighting the enemy, consolidating national strength and security, or developing the economy and culture, the Soviet Union can remove obstacles and achieve victory. The boldness of the Bolshevik thought, the fearless action, and the spirit of achieving the goal are the factors that eliminate all difficulties. In socialist countries, the development of science and technology has become a matter of national concern. Our country has many paths and opportunities to develop science and technology. Scientists and technicians have been awarded the highest award—the Stalin Prize—and their bold ideas are seen in new scientific inventions such as new aircraft, new types of artillery, and new agricultural machinery. In short, the opportunities for the future development of science and technology in our country are unlimited. Therefore, their responsibility to the people is great. The current international situation has prompted our motherland to strengthen its military and economic power and to move forward along the path of science and technology."</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 16th Dispatch: The National Broadcasting Company reported from Ankara yesterday that the Soviet Union has announced general mobilization and canceled all military personnel's leave.

<h3>Hitler Plans to Convene European Conference; Will Invite the Soviet Union, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey to Participate; German Foreign Minister Meets with Japanese Ambassador to Italy; British Ambassador and Turkish Foreign Minister Discuss Soviet Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, Istanbul, 16th Dispatch: According to German sources, Hitler intends to convene a European conference in the near future, imitating the British government's practice of convening a conference of Allied countries. Representatives from all signatory countries and occupied countries of the Tripartite Pact will attend. It is rumored that the Soviet Union will also participate, and Germany will also invite Sweden, Spain, and Turkey to participate, so that all European countries that are still outside Hitler's "New Order" will also be included. The purpose of the conference is to make social, political, and economic arrangements for the European "New Order."</p>
<p>Reuters, Istanbul, 16th Dispatch: British Ambassador Hugessen met with Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu for an hour yesterday. It is widely believed that the situation in the Soviet Union may have been among the issues discussed by the two.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch: The German official news agency stated that at the ceremony in Venice yesterday for Croatia to join the Tripartite Pact, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano welcomed the participating representatives, saying that this pact is not a temporary matter, but will become the permanent basis for general cooperation. Any country that shares the desire of Germany, Italy, and Japan to build a new world order and world security can join. The Axis powers recognize that the establishment of an independent Croatia is an act of justice to correct the injustices of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch: A dispatch from Rome stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had two long talks when they met to discuss Croatia's joining the Axis. Ribbentrop also met with Japanese Ambassador Horikiri.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Pay Attention to German-Soviet Situation</p>
<p>United Press, London, 16th Dispatch: British newspapers have recently published speculations about the rumored Soviet-German relationship in prominent positions. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both stated that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, may not return to the Soviet Union and may take a government position. According to the government, Cripps has been recalled to report on routine matters, while the Daily Mail stated that he would not return to the Soviet Union unless the Prime Minister actively requested it. It is heard that Cripps feels that his mission has not been accomplished, and therefore advocates that the government should send a new envoy. London newspapers believe that Stalin has yielded to Hitler's demands, but there is no confirmed news here that the German side has any demands. The newspapers' belief is largely based on the claim that the Soviet Union will not resist German aggression. The Daily Telegraph stated, "We can more or less imagine Stalin taking a certain approach to save face." The Times, on the other hand, repeatedly stated that Hitler may be employing a feint to the east while striking in the west. The newspaper stated, "The British government does not believe that Hitler is definitely planning to attack the Soviet Union." Among the various pieces of information obtained here, the above news seems to be the most important. Furthermore, the Daily Mail's Ankara correspondent stated that the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union presented a note to Stalin two weeks ago, requesting the Soviet Union to join the Tripartite Pact, allow German troops to pass through Soviet territory, and demanding that the Soviet Union reply by June 18. However, the Soviet Union's reply has reached Berlin and is also trying to delay its decision. The correspondent also stated that news about German troop movements in recent days is sufficient to indicate that the Germans are preparing to launch a large-scale attack on Britain, or to attack Ukraine, or to attack both places simultaneously around June 25. Newspapers here have also prominently published news from Ankara that Hitler is planning to convene a European conference, and news from travelers from Hungary and Romania that they expect German troops to invade the Soviet Union within two weeks.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting off the Coast of Lebanon: British and Australian Forces Capture Sidon; Kiswe and Jezzine Also Fall; German Bomber Squadrons Defeated in Aerial Battles</h3>
<p>United Press, Cairo, 16th – Official announcement was made yesterday that Allied forces have shattered the French defenses in the central sector of Syria. A squadron of German bombers was defeated in fierce aerial combat off the coast of Lebanon. At that time, the British Navy bombarded Sidon, and when the German squadron came to bomb, it was driven back by British aircraft. Because German aircraft participated in the battle, the British side admits that French resistance on most fronts has greatly intensified. It is reported that British and Australian forces and their tank columns have broken through Sidon's defense line and are fighting in the city's streets. The entire 18-mile-long Damour defense line has been breached. Kissine, 17 miles west of Sidon, has also been captured by British forces. This battle has opened the road to attack Beirut and Damascus. Furthermore, British aircraft attacked German airfields in the Rayak area near Beirut, destroying several aircraft, and also bombed the Aleppo airfield. Damascus is gradually being surrounded by Free French forces.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – A British Air Force communiqué from the Middle East stated that the British Air Force continues to assist the army fighting in Syria and the British warships assisting offshore. German bombers, escorted by fighters, approached British warships but were intercepted by British fighters, and several were damaged.

The British Naval Air Arm launched torpedoes and hit an enemy ship near Beirut.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 16th – After capturing Sidon, Australian troops have advanced to a certain stronghold 18 miles from Beirut, which is the Syrian naval and military base. It is reported that Beirut is constantly being bombed by the Royal Air Force, while Damascus has not been subjected to air raids.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 15th – According to Turkish radio, although many Beirut residents have gone to mountain resorts to escape the heat, the port is currently very peaceful. The Prime Minister of Syria issued a notice in Damascus, instructing residents to remain calm, stating that the current situation "provides no reason for panic," and that the authorities have taken all measures to protect their lives and property. French communiqués also state that naval and air forces jointly contained the British fleet with good results, and that there is no fighting in southern Syria.</p>
<p>British Forces Advance on Three Routes; Damascus Under Siege</p>
<p>United Press, London, 16th – Official announcement today stated that British forces are advancing on Syria via three routes and have surrounded Damascus. It was also stated that British forces are only 12 miles from Beirut and are using a pincer movement strategy to threaten the main Vichy forces retreating from Sasa, as the enemy forces are in danger of being cut off. Other Allied troops are still stationed in the suburbs of Damascus, awaiting negotiations for a peaceful entry into the city, while continuing to tighten the encirclement. A stronghold seven miles east of Kisford has been captured by British forces. The press predicts that Damascus will fall within 24 hours. Since the British forces began their offensive at 2:00 AM on June 8th, they have occupied 27,000 square miles of coastline and are advancing on Beirut and Damascus via five routes.</p>

<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th – A British military spokesman here has confirmed the gradual advance of British and Free French forces, stating that Kiswe and Jezzine have both been captured by Allied forces. The spokesman also stated that after capturing Kiswe southeast of Damascus, the Allied forces are now beginning military operations east of Kiswe, eight miles away at Atriyeh. The capture of Jezzine in the Lebanese mountains east of the ancient city of Sidon has allowed the troops in the area to run parallel with the column advancing along the coastal highway to Beirut. The spokesman denied that British forces from Iraq had occupied Tell es Chehab on the Euphrates River, 50 miles inside the Syrian border.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – Authorities here have announced that the Allied advance in Syria has reached a certain point. After the enemy forces withdrew from Kiswe, the city fell into Allied hands. Forces are now being divided into eastern and western routes in an attempt to encircle Damascus. Also, the northern bank of A'ajjeh is now controlled by Allied forces, and they are advancing towards Sasa in central Syria. This victory seems slow because they want to minimize the loss of life.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – It has been confirmed here that Allied forces have entered Sidon and Kiswe, 11 miles from Damascus.</p>
<p>British Mechanized Units Occupy Kaimar Outpost</p>

<h3>Hindu Moderates' Conference Concludes; Resolution Passed to Postpone Direct Action on Constitutional Demands</h3>

<p>European War Anecdotes (6) (3)</p>
<h3>Memories of the United States Entering the War in 1917</h3>
<p>US President Roosevelt recently said in a "fireside chat": "The entire history of the United States is tied to the freedom of the seas. The US Navy has fought repeatedly to uphold this freedom." This important statement is similar to the situation before President Wilson declared war on Germany 24 years ago. It is worthwhile for us to revisit old events. The following is a translation of what was published in the American Journal of Diplomacy:</p>
<p>There are various opinions on why the United States entered the European War in 1917. But at least one person knew the truth, and that was President Wilson. The President, in deep water, maintained American neutrality for almost three years, but ultimately had to enter the vortex.</p>
<p>When discussing the reasons for the United States' participation in the last European War, it is necessary to start with President Wilson's personality. By virtue of his position as President, he often made decisions on foreign policy himself, and the more serious the international situation, the more important American foreign policy became. President Wilson never liked others overstepping their authority. He himself was his own foreign minister. After assessing the trends of public opinion, he made all major decisions independently. He delivered the "too proud to fight" speech and returned German Ambassador Bernstorff without any room for discussion. At the time, American sentiment was indeed biased towards the Entente Powers (Britain and France), and the prosperity of the American economy depended on maintaining trade with the Entente Powers. But to say that these facts are the reasons for the United States' entry into the war is a superficial understanding.</p>
<p>Wilson's personal feelings towards the belligerent nations, as demonstrated in all respects, could not avoid harboring a bias towards the Entente Powers, but he firmly believed that such feelings should not influence national policy. As a result, both sides of the belligerent nations accused him of favoring the other side and attacked him. But there is no doubt that he regarded maintaining American peace as his sole responsibility. He held this dual policy from August 1915, when the "Arabic" ship was sunk by a German submarine. He said, "The people of the whole country have charged me with keeping the United States out of the whirlpool of war. If we rashly participate in the war, the entire world situation will collapse, and all fair solutions will be despaired of." Even though Germany added significant insults, he would rather hold onto this policy without change. In September of the same year, he told his confidants, "The whole country is my shield, with nothing to fear. I must exercise extreme patience, but it takes a lot of thought to figure out to what extent patience is still a virtue."</p>
<p>But in addition to Wilson's determination to maintain American peace, he was even more determined to protect his country's neutral rights. He insisted that American honor should be above all else. In February 1916, he said, "I have tried hard to keep the country out of the whirlpool of war. But the people have entrusted me with one more important thing, which is to protect the honor of the United States and not let it be tarnished. This is not something I can do on my own, but depends on the actions of the belligerent nations. Therefore, American honor and peace are in danger of being impossible to maintain at any time. The people should not be harsh on this contradictory situation."</p>
<p>Wilson used an impartial attitude to defend American neutral rights, denouncing both sides of the belligerent nations. He believed that the British and French naval blockade policy violated international law and protested, stating that the United States did not recognize this semi-blockade status as legitimate. In the late summer of 1916, Congress granted the President broad powers, allowing him to prohibit loans and implement embargoes when necessary, as a means of retaliation. Several weeks later, he advocated strongly warning British Foreign Secretary Grey, saying: "The American people are increasingly anxious about the violation of neutral rights. The intensity of their anti-British sentiment is no less than it was at the beginning of anti-German sentiment."</p>
<p>The reason the President did not implement an embargo against Britain and France was that just when the issue of Britain and France obstructing neutral countries' trade was raging, Germany suddenly expanded its submarine destruction policy, diverting American attention. Colonel House said in his memoirs, "If Germany had not lost American sympathy due to tactical considerations, the United States would never have allowed Britain and France to control trade on the high seas." British Naval Minister Churchill also said that Germany's initial trial of submarine policy had given us great help. Our discord with the United States has since vanished, and people's hearts were greatly comforted for a time.</p>
<p>Wilson believed that the nature of Germany's infringement of American rights was different from that of Britain and France, and the methods of dealing with them were also different. If Germany's submarine policy was specifically aimed at the British and French naval blockade, it could have been tolerated, but this policy greatly harmed the rights of neutral countries. Due to tactical considerations in submarine warfare, merchant ships of belligerent or neutral countries, whether carrying contraband or not, could not be given warning and had to be suddenly sunk and then quickly escaped, making it inconvenient to rescue passengers and sailors on board. Wilson found that public opinion in the country was greatly shocked by this large-scale destruction by Germany. This was not a subtle issue of law. German submarines indiscriminately destroyed American lives and property, which was naturally very different from the blockade by Britain and France. Between January and March 1917, American ports had mountains of goods piled up, and all industries were declining, which was the result of the submarine threat.</p>
<p>If the submarine policy only threatened American material interests, Wilson would not have declared war on Germany. He never regarded purely material interests as a prerequisite for national policy. Although German-American relations were fraught with difficulties, the resolution of economic issues was not yet on the verge of collapse. However, Germany's submarine tactics, which disregarded the lives of American sailors and passengers, involved the issue of human rights. The boundary between material interests and human rights is clear. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Germany Sinks Robin Moor, Intending to Force US into War; First Application of Axis Strategy to Deprive US of Adequate Preparation</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th – A well-informed naval source here told United Press reporters yesterday that he believes the sinking of the "Robin Moor" by a German submarine is the first application of the Axis powers' military strategy, intended to drive US naval patrols away from the strategically critical North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and into the South Atlantic. This source, who declined to be named, pointed out that it is a well-known fact that the North Atlantic desperately needs patrols, and this patrol force is already operating in a wide area. If the US patrol force here is dispersed, German submarine raiders and long-range aircraft will find it easier to succeed in their anti-British operations in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th – Several newspapers are calling for retaliatory measures for the sinking of the American ship Robin Moor by a German submarine. The Milwaukee Journal said that since the high seas are threatened by Nazi warships' piracy, the United States has every reason to sink any German ship it sees, whether on the surface or submerged, and rid the Atlantic of German ships. The Boston Globe also called the sinking of the American ship by a German submarine piracy and considered clearing the pirates the appropriate response. A recent Gallup poll showed that 55 percent of voters favored naval escorts for ships carrying military supplies to Britain, while 29 percent were opposed, and the rest were undecided. Regarding aid to Britain, 55 percent supported President Roosevelt's stance, 33 percent thought the President was going too far, and the rest thought the President was not doing enough.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 15th – Political figures here generally believe that President Roosevelt's claim in his fireside chat that the principle of freedom of the seas is one of the foundations of American foreign policy means that the sinking of the American cargo ship "Robin Moor" by a German submarine has endangered this principle. Deputy Secretary of State Welles told reporters the other day that the cargo ship was sunk far from the war zone. As for the German Foreign Ministry's statement that any ship carrying arms and ammunition to Britain should be sunk, Welles called it "outrageous and unreasonable." This is the general view of the American government. In Germany, it seems that they would rather have the United States enter the war now, when American preparations are not complete, than let the United States choose the time to fight. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's recent speech, in which he said that even if the United States "openly declares war on the Axis powers, there is nothing to fear," shows that this view is not without merit. Well-informed sources believe that the United States can only demand a formal apology and compensation from Germany, and a guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future. If this request is rejected, the prestige of the United States will be greatly damaged. Therefore, if Germany refuses the above request, the United States will sever diplomatic relations with Germany. President Roosevelt's decision to freeze Axis funds in the United States is probably a warning to the German government.</p>
<h3>Yarnell Urges Full Aid to China</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 16th – Former US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell said last night at the 39th annual meeting of the Yale University Chinese Students Association that if the United States wants future peace, China must be a free and stable country. Yarnell advocated providing China with a huge amount of material aid and said that the idea of American isolationists is "a fool's dream." Yarnell also said that if the United States does not want to see democracy, freedom, and human rights disappear from the earth, the Sino-Japanese War may soon become the United States' war. Yarnell praised Chinese relief donations and considered them the most economical way to maintain Chinese morale.</p>

<h3>Brazil Borrows from US to Build Air Force Base; Discussions in Rio de Janeiro; Other American Nations Will Hold Similar Talks</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th – Brazilian Army Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Rimmick announced yesterday that negotiations are underway for Brazil to borrow 100 million from US credit to build an air force base on the Brazilian coast opposite Dakar. The State Department declined to comment on this official announcement. Lieutenant Colonel Rimmick also said that the loan negotiations are being held in Rio de Janeiro and that sovereignty over the air force base will belong to the Brazilian government, but the United States will be allowed to use it in times of emergency. Part of the loan will be used to purchase arms and ammunition for the Brazilian army from the United States. Some observers believe that these negotiations demonstrate Brazil and the Western Hemisphere countries' determination to genuinely cooperate in resisting foreign aggression. They also pointed out that although Germany had used large quantities of arms to exchange for Brazilian coffee, Brazil has now decided to obtain arms assistance from the United States. At the same time, it was stated that other Latin American countries will also conduct similar negotiations. Political circles say that credit loans may be extended to Chile.</p>

Industry must open its employment doors, and all qualified workers who are loyal to their duties must be employed, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or color. It is hoped that the Bureau will immediately find ways to facilitate the full utilization of domestic manpower.</p>
<h3>Democracy Victory Conference Held in the US</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th – The Democracy Victory Conference is being held here today, launching a movement to coordinate the work of private organizations around the world and combine the spirit of democracy to resist Hitlerism and Nazi propaganda. The meeting was initiated by the Committee to Aid the Allies and Defend America, and attendees include representatives from 15 countries, including former Spanish Republican Foreign Minister del Vayo, Norwegian Parliamentary Speaker Hambro, former French Air Minister Cote, famous French aviator Torellivet, President of the French Permanent Association Hundredry, and Italian anti-fascist leader and former Foreign Minister Sforza. The meeting has appointed an organizing committee of 15 members from China, Britain, Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Norway to coordinate anti-Nazi propaganda around the world. According to Torellivet, the Vichy government only has the support of 5 to 10 percent of French people, and he explained the current situation in France, saying that opposition to Nazi sabotage is increasing daily. Bombings of armories, blocked traffic, destroyed railway vehicles, and bombed airports have occurred in Lille, Lyons, and Marseille. Torellivet reiterated the need to conduct anti-propaganda in France, because Vichy is trying to use Italy's position in the Axis to lure the people, and said that if Britain wins, France will only be another British dominion.</p>

<h3>China Youth Association Held College Guidance Lecture Yesterday. Gu Zhuoren Spoke on "Entering University"</h3>
<p>The college guidance lecture hosted by the Lifelong Department of the Chinese YMCA began yesterday at 4 p.m. in the assembly hall of the Ba Xian Qiao branch. Mr. Gu Zhuoren, Director of Guidance at Zhijiang University, spoke on "Entering University," summarizing as follows:</p>
<p>Considering Human Nature</p>
<p>You are one in a thousand in Chinese society. After entering university in the next term, you will be one in ten thousand. The opportunity is rare and can be imagined. In this great era of resistance and nation-building, it is not easy to enter university. Therefore, if the issue of your further education is not handled carefully, it would be a great pity. Consequently, college guidance is increasingly needed. This type of guidance is very common in countries like England and the United States, but it is extremely rare in Chinese society. Often, those who are capable of pursuing further education only consider social trends and neglect their own personalities, resulting in their studies failing to reach their full potential. For example, today China urgently needs specialized technical personnel, and many students respond to this need by flocking to engineering courses, etc. However, often because their personalities are not suitable, the results of their forced studies are very limited. As a result, first-class talent is very rare. Therefore, before pursuing further education, you should first analyze yourselves, review your own personalities, and discuss which field of skills you are suited for.</p>
<p>Three Examples</p>
<p>For example, common occupations can be divided into three categories: (1) relationships with people, (2) relationships with things, and (3) relationships with imagination. If you aspire to succeed as a famous doctor in the medical field, then the primary question is whether you are deeply interested in people. Otherwise, you will be unable to deal with countless patients. The same applies to those who want to become lawyers; they must be good at socializing. If you prefer to stay at home, no one will pay attention to you. Regarding the second point, if you study agriculture or chemistry, you must be deeply interested in things. Regarding the third point, if you want to become a famous literary writer, you must possess sufficient imagination. The above describes the relationship between a person's personality and their choice of study, but there is no absolute distinction, only a comparison in degree.</p>
<p>Second Understanding</p>
<p>As for those who are interested in all three points mentioned above, then their interests are very broad, and they are suitable to be journalists, that is, they have the talent of a leader. After understanding yourself, you must also understand what a university is. As the saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Regarding this point: (1) University is a stage of learning, not the end. Learning has no limit. During this stage, you will be told the methods of reading and the rules of research. There will be less time for teacher guidance and more time for self-study, which is clearly different from middle school. These four years are a necessary stage. (2) Some say that calling university students "Hanlin" or "Tu Daifu" (old terms for scholars) seems very outdated. It is better to call them "Junzi" (gentlemen) because during the university period, personality and knowledge are both trained. Therefore, the university trains you to become a complete person. (3) The courses you take during university may have some distance from the work you obtain after graduation. For example, those who study railway engineering may serve on highways after graduation, which is also acceptable. Generally, people believe that the courses you take in university determine your future fixed job, which is actually a mistake. (4) The courses offered in universities are generally universal. Do not think that since you have a specialization, you do not need to take other required courses. You must know that many departments of knowledge have inseparable connections.</p>
<p>Physical Training</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to enter university, you should first pay attention to physical training. Otherwise, what is the use of receiving a university diploma and then taking it into your coffin? Wouldn't it be a waste of precious money? In addition, you should also pay attention to the entrance examination and the choice of school. The former should not be taken too seriously. As long as you are truly studying during middle school, there is no problem in entering university. For caution, you should take the examination for at most two universities at the same time. There is no need to take the examination for four universities; it is a waste of energy, time, and registration fees. One or two days before the exam, it is best not to read books and conserve energy for full effort. Some people cram at the last minute and burn the midnight oil before the exam, which is harmful and not beneficial.</p>
<p>Examination Techniques</p>
<p>Also, during the exam, answer as many questions as possible to get more points because schools only use comparative standards to admit new students, not absolute standards. Regarding the choice of university, there are two points: (1) there are many courses; (2) professors must have solid knowledge. Regarding the subjects of the university entrance examination, for the liberal arts and business schools approved by the National Government's Ministry of Education, the liberal arts subjects are Civics, Chinese, English, Mathematics (Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Biology. The science and engineering subjects are Civics, Chinese, English, Mathematics (Higher Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Trigonometry), Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Physics and Chemistry.</p>

<p>As for today's program, it has been set.</p>
<h3>New Huan No. 2 Elementary School Announces Early Vacation. Teachers Unwilling to Hold Examinations</h3>
<p>(Da Hua News Agency) The privately-run New Huan No. 2 Elementary School on Chongqing Road in this city previously had a work slowdown due to teachers requesting improved treatment and early issuance of employment contracts. Fortunately, after proper mediation by educational authorities, the improvement in treatment was resolved first, and classes were quickly resumed. However, regarding the issue of the timing of the issuance of employment contracts, the school insisted that they would only be issued after the vacation, and the two sides' opinions never came close to agreement. Although educational authorities repeatedly sent personnel for mediation and proposed a compromise solution, advising the school to issue the employment contracts on the day the examinations began, when the term examinations began yesterday, and the relevant authorities were sending personnel to have a final talk with the principal of the school, the teachers, believing that their jobs were not guaranteed, were unwilling to hold the term examinations and were willing to continue teaching as usual. However, the school authorities, citing academic regulations, did not allow for any changes, so they sent some students from the third grade of the business department of the middle school to administer the examinations, resulting in a serious conflict and leading to injuries from fighting between middle and elementary school students. The school authorities then announced to the parents in the afternoon that they would declare an early vacation. The teachers also issued a declaration stating their grievances. However, according to the principal, the teachers who were unwilling to hold the term examinations were only a part of the teachers, not all of them. The middle school students who were sent were to protect the teachers who were willing to administer the examinations, he said.</p>

<h3>How to Study English (5)</h3>
<p>— Ye Jinfeng</p>
<p>Words should be selected carefully; it's not about having many. Shakespeare only used 15,000 words. Next is Thackeray, with only eight or nine thousand. Stevenson only used six or seven thousand. Most people only need around three thousand good words, which is enough. But you need to know the accurate usage. Just knowing the word is not enough. By "carefully selected," I mean: (1) read articles by standard writers; (2) use your discerning eye to select them. You can collect two or three, at most four or five words a day, which is already remarkable.</p>
<p>As for grammar and rhetoric, it's best not to read them rigidly. When you feel the need, just refer to them.</p>
<p>You don't have to memorize when reading, but when you come across a very good sentence, you can write it down in a small notebook you carry with you. When you come across a very good paragraph, you can also copy it down, prepare to observe it often, but don't do too much, as it's easy to get tired of it.</p>
<p>Writing</p>
<p>1. Structure: If you know how to read, you should know how to write. The old-fashioned composition formula is the "beginning, development, turn, and conclusion" four-character formula. Modern composition is "introduction, 1, 2, 3, conclusion," which is not very different from the old-fashioned one. The "introduction" is the preface, 1, 2, and 3 are the points, and the "conclusion" is the conclusion. Short compositions can cut off the beginning and end. The most important thing is still the solid points. It's best to avoid irrelevant nonsense. For the method of structure, please refer to the first point in the previous article, "How to Read," and it will become clear.</p>
<p>2. Practice: The best way to practice composition is to write and revise on your own. Franklin succeeded by doing just that. His method was to take a good article from others, take down the main points, and after two days, develop it into an article according to these main points, and then compare it with the original article. When comparing, you need to be calm and focused. Why is mine not good? What is good about theirs? Once you understand what is good about theirs, you have to take it into your own hands. We can translate a small section of a good article, and after a day or two, translate it back, compare it with the original sentence by sentence, and carefully ponder it. When practicing at first, it doesn't matter if even a sentence is wrong, "as long as you are willing to put your heart into it, a pestle can be ground into a needle."</p>

<h3>Finance: After the U.S. Freezes German and Italian Funds, Speculation Rises and Foreign Exchange is Dumped</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC listed all exchange rates as flat. The dark market for British and American exchange rates first loosened and then slightly rebounded. News reported that the U.S. President approved the freezing of German and Italian funds. Speculators came in droves to dump, and the U.S. dollar for next month fell to $5.4375 in the chaos but then hardened to being convertible. Hua Bank slightly absorbed, and foreign banks also absorbed at the higher price. Importers were heard to be settling payments, and the trend turned soft. British gold at 3 3/8s 34375 was also difficult to convert. In the afternoon, speculators dumped even more (a total of 500,000 US dollars were sold throughout the day), causing the July rate to harden to $5.4375, up .0625, and the near-term rate to $5.40625, up .03125.

After the silver balance tax was still levied at 23.75%, foreign banks slightly absorbed, and the speculative selling momentum weakened. The market stabilized and turned slightly soft. The afternoon close for British gold was 3 3/8s 328125, and the U.S. dollar was $5.40625.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Plunge in a Fierce Selling Wave</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a continued sharp decline in the unofficial rate, with the price breaking the 6,400 yuan mark. This was due to the fatigue from the weekend, and the U.S. President ordered the freezing of German and Italian funds in the U.S. The U.S. dollar for July at 5 yuan and 4375 had supply but no demand. Gold prices, in a consistent and fierce selling wave, saw a low price of 6,355 yuan. Because the drop had exceeded the looseness of foreign exchange, the settlement price was huge. Exchange houses Xinfeng and Yongdu came in to arbitrage 6-7,000 taels, and foreign exchange stopped loosening and slightly rebounded. The price then climbed up to 6,398 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was heard that Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., had safely arrived in Chongqing and would take office as Foreign Minister, which excited people. Moreover, distant-month U.S. dollars became cheaper again, and Dafeng Yiyuan re-emerged, and the price was heavily suppressed, finally closing down a small 45 兀. Transactions for the whole day were 6-70,000 taels. The swap (June transferred to July) was posted by the seller Yifeng to Mingfeng for 50,000 taels, and to Yida for 450 taels, both at 50 yuan, and again at 8 yuan. Cash, on the other hand, rose. Yongfengyu put out 50 taels at a time and 50 taels at a time, and Yongfengyu put out 20 taels, and Yili put out 30 taels, all bought by Chengji, and the price was also 250 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Xianghe took in 20 taels from Tianyuan, 350 yuan higher, and the price increased by 15 yuan. Ornaments were flat.</p>
<p>Futures Dropped 45 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, the July rate per bar (ten taels) fell below 6,400 yuan due to news favoring sellers, and people were uneasy. The opening price at 9:15 a.m. was 6,380 yuan, 36 yuan lower. Under the selling pressure of Xinfeng Yongyu Xingyong and various accounts, from 6,385 yuan, it plunged sharply, and floating accounts followed suit and replenished. Foreign exchange stopped loosening and slightly rebounded, and the price then climbed to around 6,380 yuan. Near noon, Xinfeng and Yongyi repeatedly arbitraged in 6-7,000 taels, and Dafeng, Shunyuan, and Chengji all bought, rising to 6,398 yuan. The noon close was 6,393 yuan. The opening at 2 p.m. was 6,390 yuan, 3 yuan lower. It continued to fall to 6,385 yuan. Hengji and Xinfeng Yongli entered, rising to 6,395 yuan. Suddenly, Dafeng, Yifeng, Deda, and Chida came to sell, and the next-month U.S. dollar was difficult to sell at 5 yuan and 4375. The price then gradually fell to 6,368 yuan. Tongkang Yong and Xinfeng Yongli entered, rising to 6,372 yuan. The close at 3:30 p.m. was 6,371 yuan, down a small 45 yuan from the Saturday afternoon close.

The selling price of wooden-labeled gold for cash accounts was 360 yuan higher than the heat-red futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Has Not Yet Hung Small</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at silverware shops, Datongxing and Xintongxing, was still listed at 695 yuan, and the buying price was 40 yuan less, it was said.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Shuangma Factory Tight for a Single Day, Yarn Prices Rise Formidably, Highest Price at 1,516 Yuan, Already Running Counter to Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market, which had been hovering for several days, resumed its upward trend, and the rise was particularly intense. This was because the Guangzhou merchants continued to demand Shuangma yarn unabated, causing Shuangma factory singles to be tighter. Shorts were posting 5-7.5 jiao for day swaps, which made the longs more stable and could reduce the profit margin by half. As for the shorts, seeing this situation, they posted the profit margin every day, from 2.5 to 7.5 yuan per ten packages. Since Guangzhou business continued without interruption, they were of divided mind, and so they painfully compensated, and with the wind tightening, the market price went straight up. The final closing price was 1,511 yuan, but generally, the well-capitalized short positions, due to weak labeling and small offsetting, were still struggling. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,511 yuan, and the low price was 1,465 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the price surged to 1,516 yuan, and then, with profits being released, the securities brokers joined in selling, falling back to 1,492 yuan, and the final price was 1,496 yuan. Someone wanted to enter, it was said. Today, there are 145 pieces of cotton yarn bound for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning. Because reports said that the Japanese army was expanding the silver line in the South China Sea and freezing the funds of European countries that had fallen into enemy hands, people were calm. The opening price was 1,465 yuan, and with floating accounts selling and shorts pressing down, it fell to 1,465 yuan. Unexpectedly, in an instant, many said that Guangzhou merchants were still trading Shuangma, and the market was buying strongly, and the market suddenly rose, surging to 1,495 yuan. By the time of the close, there were many rumors, all of which were bullish, and the price surged again to close at 1,511 yuan. The transaction statistics for half a day totaled 10,720 packages, of which the Hong Kong merchants took in 1,720 packages, and the domestic merchants took 9,000 packages.</p>
<p>The market for Jin Shuangma standard yarn rose gradually from the opening. The market continued to rise at the afternoon opening, but the closing fell back slightly. As a result, the July rate rose 7 yuan, and the August rate rose 3 yuan. The total transaction statistics for the day were 8,600 packages, which was less than the spot. This was because speculators had not yet concentrated huge amounts of capital and were not easy to coordinate. Generally, they were willing to issue profit margins for both longs and shorts and drill into the spot market.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Increasingly Promising</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation continues to be good, and fine绒原料 (fine fleece raw material) is especially tight. This is because foreign cotton is gradually rising. As for the factories, because yarn sales are active, their interest in raw materials is gradually increasing.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods, Yarn Prices Surge, Factory Cloth Increases Consistently</h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices trended upward yesterday, due to increased interest from local streets, Hong Kong merchants, and Southeast Asian merchants.  The prices of both foreign cotton and yarn have risen, influencing sentiment.  Traders and hoarders have also been absorbing stock, so sales prices for all cloths have risen across the board.  White goods and fine cloth twills increased (per piece) by 2.5 to 5 角.  Bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 角. Local street transactions totaled over 600 pieces of various cloths. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian merchants transacted over 400 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and twills. Northern route, Qingdao merchants transacted 40-50 pieces of pigment serge, melton, and other goods. Today, there are 700 pieces of piece goods arriving from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill increased (per piece) by 4-5 角. The range of fluctuations for twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth warehouse receipts was very narrow. The closing price for the after-market was $45.10. Colored goods, Four Gentlemen serge, meat yarn, and yarn surged sharply. Hoarders continued to search for stock. The morning opening was $1.445875, gradually rising. It jumped to $1.515, then due to changing horse yarn, the downward trend faltered. Hand-held goods from traders were also willing to loosen, once falling to $1.49125. At closing, it rebounded again to $1.4975.</p>
<h3>Grains: Another 50,000 Bags Arrive Today, Foreign Rice Continues to Fall, Ningbo Merchants Purchase, Broken Rice Stands Alone</h3>
<p>工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) foreign rice continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Ninghai vessel arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 10,000 bags of 工部局 foreign rice from Hong Kong. The vessel berthed at Yuedong Wharf yesterday and is scheduled to move to the wharf of the company on the Bund in the French Concession this morning for unloading. A certain American vessel managed by Wah Lun Foreign Firm, carrying a large quantity of foreign rice directly from Yangon to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to arrive the day before yesterday but did not arrive. Yesterday, the company stated that it was rescheduled to arrive today, with an estimated 40,000 bags of foreign rice, scheduled to berth at the Lumao Wharf in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<p>The market for foreign rice mostly continued to decline yesterday, but the market for broken rice, handled by Ningbo merchants, was weak but rebounded. The result was similar to the previous close. Saigon 小纹 (small pattern) rice initially fell and then stabilized, but the final price was still about $1 lower than Saturday's closing price.  The reason is that when the market opened in the morning, there were more arrivals than expected, and public sales of rice continued to be ordered and allocated. Customer hoarders were anxious, and the market atmosphere was extremely heavy with selling. High-grade rice fell across the board, falling by 元外 to about $2. Afterwards, Ningbo merchants took advantage of the small price to absorb stock, focusing on broken rice. A large quantity of both spot goods and original Ying Wah Company bags were taken in. It is said that the Ningbo group has already handled 15,000-16,000 bags, including the original bags. The market gradually rebounded. However, other rice prices were weak due to the lack of both local and outside customers. Broken rice from Ying Wah Company initially opened at $107, then ranged from $107.20 to $108. Small 絞 (small twist) also rose from $127 to $128.50. 路貨 (road goods) $136. No. 1 Saigon opened at $136 in the early market, and later the goods rebounded sharply, with calls as high as $1-2, but no agreement was reached. The total transaction volume for Ying Wah Company was 1,300-1,400 tons, and 15,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>Thick and thin粳 (Japonica) domestic rice, southern port early and late rice, from the middle of the day off, the source of supply is visibly more, and wood village stores, due to weather relations, is dull, the market immediately presents oversupply, still weak, made open various prices see a decline of about $2.50. Fresh early and late rice sold for $121 and $130, old rice $116-117, old original bag $117. On the thick粳 market, there are only some Wuxi original bag old粳. Since goods are scarce, prices are neither cheap nor low, so the owners are reluctant to sell, and prices are unlikely to change, remaining stable. Subsequent openings were $101 and $120.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, rice noodle and cake stores and other retail appetite, although still not smooth, but because the previous market transport was low, owners defended prices, market goods are scarce, the market continues to be flat, there is no rise or fall. Subsequent openings were Hong Kong high round grain $144-145, long grain $112-113, followed by $110, tender tea special $106-107, medium resolute $103-104, domestic 元 high from $120, resolute to $116.</p>
<h3>Flour Hoarders Eager to Try</h3>
<p>The洋粉 (foreign flour) market, initially flat, then tight. The morning opening was not smooth due to local customer digestion, and the rice market did not escape its sideways pattern, making it difficult to excite people. Hoarders were cautious, and prices for all goods were stable. However, the after-market suddenly tightened because the source of new wheat still had many problems, and with the rising prices of oil beans and corn, local customer hoarders became active again. Golden Dragon flour initially opened at $29.30 to $29.35, and later rose to $29.50 to $29.70. Fort powder also rose from $30.02-30.03 to $30.80. There was also Fortune God flour at $29.20, Flying Scissors brand at $28.80. A total of more than 20,000 bags were traded. The market has entered a gradual rise.</p>
<p>The source of new wheat is still quiet. Chinese merchants have been banned and have no purchases. Only Japanese 鑫 factory continues to throw in, cooperating with grain merchants, selling at around $40. Therefore, the listing of new wheat this year is entirely controlled by someone.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cake Market Coming to an End, Market Conditions Declining Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bean cake market only had June lower period futures calling on the market. Other expired items were out of the market. Spot cake transactions were quiet. A total of 300 pieces of Fei Zi cake opened, priced at $17.10. As a result, the futures market atmosphere was in a slump, and the rumor that the traditional system of soybeans being moved out can be used to collect taxes in kind dealt a fatal blow to the bulls. Therefore, market conditions seem to be declining rapidly, falling $0.40-$0.50 compared to last weekend. A total of Sheng Ji's June upper warehouse receipts and June lower delivery contracts were traded for 10,000 pieces, opening at $18.85 to $18.70, once recovering to $18.80, then falling again to close at $18.65. Local sales of soybean oil and peanut oil were slightly connected, and market conditions continued to rise by about $1-$2 due to sellers' efforts to push up prices. 90 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded. The price is detailed in the market price column. 50 barrels of Hankou soybean oil, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil, and 400 cans in cans, 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, and 20 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil were traded. Today, there are 230 bags of beans, 1,000 pieces of bean cake, and 330 bags of sesame seeds, all being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Fluctuates, Industrial Stocks Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter public bond market had a slight fluctuation yesterday. The shorts repeatedly exerted pressure, but the market did not decline. Observing that the 41st issue, Ji Ji, Zhongfu Bank, and Xinfu were constantly absorbing on dips, it is feared that the market will not easily fall back. The news front is very good. The United States plans to provide China with US$1 billion in arms aid, and with considerable cash, to help China maintain foreign exchange. People across the country were excited, and the future gradually showed a glimmer of hope. Yesterday morning, the 41st issue, Xinfu, Lianyi, and Hengfu bought in, with the 41st issue being the most. Yuxing, Runli, Xin, Yichang sold out, with Yuxing being the most. The market was relatively weak. In the afternoon, the 41st issue and Xinfu, Lianyi continued to buy in. Xinchang, Yichang, and Xie Kang covered shorts and turned long. Yuxing continued to sell out. Runli and Runde also dumped. Tongkang and Tongshun suppressed the market price, but the market price rose instead. As a result, highs and lows were seen by 1-2 角. A total of 1.8 million yuan was transacted. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded, priced at $7.95.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the 衆業 (Public Enterprise) Public Office was mediocre, then became active again. Famous industrial stocks continued to rise. There was a slight pullback in the afternoon. The number of transactions was very large. Rubber stocks remained dim.</p>

Then the over-the-counter market price, British brand $1,440, Old Knife brand $1,010, Five China brand $730, Little Fairy brand $705. Because people's interest is still high, the flour market is searching, so spot goods in the market suddenly feel scarce, and the buying price may rise again.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Black Tea Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Now, in the tea-producing areas of Zhejiang Province, the sales of洋莊 (foreign firm) green tea have plummeted, and most of them have been converted to black tea.

It is understood that recently, Japanese merchants have transported more than 12,000 piculs of new black tea from 口 Hangzhou and Tangqi to prepare for export. However, the 洋莊 market has been very sluggish, with almost no one asking about green tea. Black tea is also only purchased by Chengheng, with 140 boxes purchased at a price of $380. There is no hope of improvement in exports.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji White Coal New Arrival</h3>

<h3>China's Bitter Struggle in the Far East is Actually Fighting for the United States; There Has Been a Great Change in the Mood of the American Public and Government, Believing That Strenuous Aid to China is the Only Way to Save Themselves</h3>
<p>Special communication from Erjinshan (San Francisco): American expatriates in the Far East who have lived in or are native to China, who have recently evacuated back to the United States, one of the most visible things they have seen is that American public opinion regarding the Far East, especially regarding Japan, has undergone drastic changes. Today's Americans know much more about Far Eastern events than before, and show greater concern. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use very strong terms to condemn Japan's actions in China and in the South, and its relationship with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Understanding the Significance of China's War</p>
<p>According to some of these American expatriates who have returned, two years ago, the American people recognized Japan's invasion of China as a rather regrettable misfortune, but thought that Japan's aggression and local incidents had no impact on the United States, so they only expressed sympathy for China, and did not understand the nature of China's war. Now that they have evacuated from the East and arrived in the United States, they are shocked to see that the United States has such a firm mood towards the Sino-Japanese incident.</p>
<p>American Interests Feel Threatened</p>
<p>There are several points to describe regarding the attitude of today's Americans: (1) The fate of the United States is actually tied to the Pacific Ocean. Anyone who disrupts the labor situation in the Pacific Ocean directly threatens American interests. (2) It can now be confirmed that Japan is a threat to peace and prosperity in the Pacific region. In other words, the United States can no longer trust Japan's friendship. (3) China is actually fighting for the United States in the East, just as Britain is fighting for the United States in the West. Therefore, the United States should provide not only food, trucks, and medical supplies to the extent possible, but also aircraft, artillery, munitions, and tanks.</p>
<p>Armaments and Money Flow Steadily</p>
<p>The evacuating American expatriates also mentioned the remarks made by President Roosevelt and Mr. Wilkie, as well as many politicians, businessmen, and educators, which stated that the United States must provide credit loans and arms to China, and make China a "arsenal of democracies" fighting against aggression. It is said that this is not only a temporary policy, but will directly lead to greater concern and activity from the American public and government in the East and the Pacific. Peace and stability in the Pacific this year and in the future will certainly be of great concern to the United States. This concrete mood has great significance for the future cooperation between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The People Demand a Complete Embargo</p>
<p>A few years ago, those who said that the United States and Japan might go to war were denounced as warmongers. Today, the American people are seriously discussing whether a US-Japan war is inevitable. Therefore, the demand for an embargo on Japan from all parties has increased unabated. Many American goods are already similar to an embargo, and their purpose is undoubtedly to deal with Japan. But American public opinion already has a demand for a complete embargo. This kind of mood can be seen everywhere. For example, when newsreels show Japanese officers in Vietnam or Japanese planes bombing Chongqing, the audience all lets out contemptuous hissing sounds.</p>
<p>Establishing International Friendship and Cooperation</p>
<p>Stanford University President Wilbur said that in the Pacific region, there will be a final conference in which mankind will end strife and aggression and create a new era of international friendship and cooperation.

<h3>Seven President-Class Liners Requisitioned; Officially Announced Yesterday Morning; Each Ship Will Be Handed Over Upon Completion of Its Voyage; Twelve Other Liners Transferred to Take Over Various Shipping Lanes</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European War, the United States has decided to help democratic countries resist aggression. The material assistance provided to China and Britain in the past has been put into practice. Recently, the United States will implement escorting ships, so the situation against the German and Italian Axis powers is deteriorating. The US government is using commercial ships to help Britain transport goods, and the Maritime Commission is gradually putting it into practice.</p>
<p>Requisition of Seven Liners Officially Announced</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai branch of the American President Lines yesterday, they officially announced that they received a telegram from the San Francisco head office yesterday morning, stating that seven mail ships currently operating on the Far East-Pacific shipping lanes, including the President Taft, President Cleveland, President Coolidge, President Pierce, and the new World-Class liners President Jackson, President Hayes, and President Adams, have been requisitioned.</p>
<p>No Stops on Return Voyages to Japanese Ports</p>
<p>The President Coolidge, which is currently on its voyage, is currently returning from Little Luzon (Philippines). It will arrive in Shanghai this Thursday and return to the United States the next day. It will not stop at Kobe or Yokohama, Japan, and will sail directly to Honolulu and then to San Francisco for handover to the government. The President Pierce departed from San Francisco at the beginning of this month and is expected to arrive in port this Saturday. The President Taft has also come from San Francisco to the east the day before yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on the first of next month. It is not yet decided whether the two ships will return to the United States immediately after arriving in Shanghai or will still follow the original voyage to Hong Kong and Little Luzon.</p>
<p>World-Class Liners Handed Over on Return Voyage</p>
<p>As for the World-Class liners that are currently on their voyages, the President Jackson is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on the 10th of this month and go to various ports in Southeast Asia, pass through Mumbai, turn around the Cape of Good Hope, and return to the United States at the end of next month. Each ship will complete a determined voyage and be handed over to the Maritime Commission upon returning to the United States. After the company's seven liners were requisitioned, a solution was agreed upon for shipping affairs. It was also officially announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Twelve Liners Transferred to Take Over Shipping Affairs</p>
<p>Twelve other ships, including the President Taylor, President Madison, President Grant, President Harrison, President Monroe, President Garfield, President Van Buren, President Polk, President Buchanan, President Johnson, President Tyler, and President Fillmore, will be transferred to take over shipping affairs. Four of them have come to this city before. Among the remaining eight ships, there are both new and old ships. It is heard that several other cargo ships will also participate. However, the schedule of each ship has not yet been arranged. In the future, Sino-US shipping will not be affected.</p>
<h3>Wang Qingmu Critically Ill</h3>
<p>Elderly Wang Qingmu of Su, who has been in charge of water conservancy projects in the Lake and Huai regions and is rich in writings, and whose political achievements cover the north and south, is of advanced age and has always been in good health. Last year, he suffered from cancer on his face, but recently, it has suddenly worsened and he is in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Britain Actively Aids China to Promote Cooperation Between the Two Countries; Expanding Publicity for Aid to China is Responded to by the Government and the Public; Fundraising to Commemorate China's War of Resistance; Secretary Woodman of the British Aid to China Fund Sends a Letter Reporting on His Work</h3>
<p>Secretary Lockhart Woodman of the British Aid to China Fund recently sent a letter to a certain national salvation organization in China, describing the bombing situation in Britain and confirming the strength of British public opinion, and reporting on the work of the Fund to aid China. The Fund is the largest aid to China organization in the UK. Members are distributed throughout the country, and people from the government and the public participate. Therefore, favorable Chinese opinion is often created due to the work of the Fund. In addition to strengthening their own connections, members of the Fund often form groups of three or five to carry out external publicity, and their contact with parliamentarians and diplomats has been very successful. As a result, the formulation of British national policy is also somewhat influenced by this aid to China atmosphere.</p>
<p>Preparing a Commemoration of China's War of Resistance</p>
<p>The Fund is currently preparing a large-scale commemoration of China's four-year struggle for freedom. At that time, hundreds of thousands of copies of the booklet "Four Years of Resistance and Construction" will be printed, detailing the development and unique progress of China's original strength during the war of resistance, in order to promote the British people's universal understanding of China. A "One Bowl of Rice Dinner" will also be held on July 17 to raise relief funds for the war-stricken people in China. Ambassador Gu Weijun, who is stationed in Lisbon, will preside over this grand event. Commemorative meetings will also be held throughout the UK to make the British public understand the work that China has undertaken and is currently undertaking in the common struggle to liberate the world from Axis enslavement. Lord Lykeydolwell, Chairman of the Aid to China Fund, published an article in the Manchester Guardian, urging the British to raise funds to relieve the war victims in China and awakening the British people to the importance of China's war efforts becoming one of the three pillars of world freedom, and said that in the past few months, hundreds of people have followed the path initiated by the Aid to China Fund. The Aid to China Fund has also helped organize an industrial organization to link the work of British aid with Chinese industrial cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Silence Commemorates the Passing of the Premier in Guangzhou; the Spirit of the Premier's Adaptability Should be Emulated; the Movement to Save Lives Through Thrift Should Continue</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the assassination of the Premier in Guangzhou. Although the Central Government has stipulated that this day and the London assassination on October 11 will be combined with the commemoration of the Premier's first uprising on September 9, all circles still expressed their silence to commemorate the greatness of the Premier's revolutionary personality, and emulated the Premier's spirit of calmness and adaptability in the face of danger to cope with national disasters, struggle hard, strive to move forward, and continue to promote thrift and disaster relief movements to fulfill their national responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Principles of Conciliation by the Industrial Section for Commercial Disputes: The Labor Side Must Accept the Layoff</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the Commercial Press has been delayed for nearly two months and has not yet been resolved. Recently, in order to open up the stalemate and conduct negotiations, the labor side formally submitted six conditions to the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council through the Joint Committee of Comrades to convey to the capital side. According to the Hong Kong reply, only the severance payment for non-renewal of the contract will be changed to seven months for those who are less than seven months, and all other requests will be rejected. The Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council also stated that unless the labor side can accept</p>
<p>The Principle of Layoff</p>
<p>They are willing to serve as conciliators, otherwise they will terminate conciliation. In order to seek a direct negotiation opportunity, the labor side passed a resolution at the third meeting to voluntarily propose the first of the original six conditions, and to conduct indirect negotiations through the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The other five conditions will not be abandoned and will be prepared to negotiate directly with the capital side when the door to negotiations is opened, and will be temporarily reserved in time. Yesterday morning, they went to the Industrial Section to hear the news, and Gu Bingyuan announced the second reply from Hong Kong transferred by the capital side.</p>
<p>The severance payment for non-renewal of the contract will be changed to eight months for those who are less than eight months, and the rest will still be rejected. After studying the telegram, the representatives believed that it was ambiguous and deceptive. The so-called eight months will be supplemented for those who are less than eight months. In other words, the comrades with the lowest salary will only get a total of 416 yuan. The comrades with more than 70 yuan actually get nothing, which is too far from the original proposal. They firmly expressed their non-acceptance and asked to convey this to the capital side. In the afternoon, they went to the Industrial Section again to hear the response. As a result, the capital side still</p>
<p>Insisted on the Original Proposal</p>
<p>Without any change, no progress was made. Now, the conference believes that the association has recognized the pain and proposed the conditions in batches, originally hoping to promote direct negotiations, but unexpectedly, the capital side greatly discounted the only first condition. The future of the negotiations is very bleak. It is heard that the labor side will convene another meeting this morning to study the company's telegram and decide on future policies.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Surtax to be Levied for Another Year</h3>
<p>The import and export surtax, after being extended for one year from July 1, 29th year, the Ministry of Finance has recently decided to extend the period for another year. The following is a transcript of the Customs Notice: "The Customs's imposition of a 5% surtax on import and export goods according to the tax rate, which was extended for one year from July 1, 29th year, has been previously announced. Now, we continue to receive an order from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the customs surtax should be extended for another year from July 1, 30th year, in accordance with the original plan. This is to inform the public."</p>
<h3>Possible Continued Reduction in Electricity Supply Causes Great Anxiety for Movie Theaters; Company Notifies of Potential 75% Reduction; If Implemented, Only One Showing Per Day Possible</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that a key figure at a movie theater recently told a reporter that there is a possibility of a continued reduction in the public concession's electricity supply, which could lead to the complete closure of movie theaters. Therefore, theater operators will hold a meeting tonight (the 16th) to discuss and decide on measures to address the ongoing electricity supply reduction.</p>
<p>Electricity Supply to Theaters Reduced Last Month</p>
<p>The electricity supply to movie theaters was already reduced by 25% last month. Recently, a notice was received from the Shanghai Power Company stating, "If necessary, electricity supply will be reduced by 75% at any time." This severe measure may be implemented imminently. If so, movie theaters will face extremely difficult circumstances. With a 75% reduction in electricity, theaters will only be able to show one film per day, which will not cover expenses. Furthermore, film distributors may not be willing to screen their films under such conditions. If this happens, theaters will have no choice but to close completely.</p>
<p>Tonight's Meeting Will Propose Recommendations</p>
<p>Theater operators have invested heavily in this business and employ many people. The public also relies on theaters for leisure. Therefore, further reductions in electricity would be extremely difficult to manage. At tonight's meeting, theater operators are expected to propose sending letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Power Company, seeking a practical solution to this problem.</p>
<h3>Emergency Epidemic Hospital to Open Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital established a main branch and a branch last year on Avenue Foch and Route Haig, respectively, with 200 beds available. No fees were charged for outpatient services, hospitalization, medication, or address registration. Although only open for three months, it treated over 70,000 impoverished patients. Consequently, people from all walks of life have shown deep sympathy and support. The hospital not only charges no fees but also provides friendly and approachable service. It has been learned from the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Trade Association, which runs the hospital, that in light of the recent hot weather and the impending outbreak of epidemic diseases, they are actively preparing to establish two hospitals and expand the number of beds to 300. The first hospital will remain at its original location on Avenue Foch. The location of the second hospital is still being finalized. The hospital's mission is based on its previous spirit of service, providing free medical care to all, whether outpatient or inpatient, with the sole purpose of thoroughly saving lives. The first hospital is expected to open next month.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Market Fluctuates After US Freezes German and Italian Funds; Quickly Stabilizes; German and Italian Residents May Be Affected</h3>
<p>The US's issuance of a new order freezing German and Italian assets in America caused considerable fluctuations in the Shanghai business community yesterday morning (the 16th), especially among Chinese merchants. However, the period was short-lived. The initial sentiment in the market was that the new US freeze order exacerbated the threat of assets in the Far East being frozen in America. As a result, the foreign exchange market opened very strong, and the stock market also showed significant changes.</p>
<p>Freeze Limited to European Countries</p>
<p>After further consideration by the business community, there was relief that the new US freeze order was limited to European countries. The consensus was that the Washington government did not intend to freeze Chinese and Japanese assets in America; otherwise, Washington could have included assets in the Far East when issuing this anti-German order. The market trend quickly reversed. When the exchange rate for US dollars reached $5.4625 to $5.4375 (legal tender for one US dollar is $18.39), banks made large purchases, and the exchange rate then eased. By the afternoon, the US dollar had returned to its base exchange rate of $5.375 on Saturday (legal tender for one US dollar is $18.61).</p>
<p>Definite Information Available in Shanghai This Afternoon</p>
<p>The stock market trend turned firm, and stock prices gradually rose. At noon, Jardine Matheson shares took the lead, rising slightly above $98. Market confidence stabilized and was not disturbed. Commodity market prices initially declined but then recovered. The US banks in Shanghai have not yet received instructions from their headquarters in New York regarding the US freeze order. The freeze order was issued in New York after the close of business last week. The headquarters cannot issue instructions until the market reopens. Therefore, it is expected that these instructions will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (the 17th). The US's issuance of this freeze order will certainly affect the US dollars deposited by German and Italian residents in US banks in Shanghai to some extent. The US dollars deposited by other Axis powers' residents in other banks may also be affected. However, these German and Italian residents seem to have already taken sufficient precautions. Therefore, the US freeze order may not have a significant impact on Shanghai's finances or general commerce.</p>
<h3>Russian Foreman Causes Death; Demand for Punishment</h3>
<p>Small workers at the Swire &amp; Co. wharf on the Bund in the French Concession went on strike due to the anger of all the small workers after a Russian foreman pushed small worker Zhang San into the river, causing him to drown. It is now known that after mediation by the French Concession authorities, the strike ended at 11 am yesterday, and the workers resumed work. The Russian foreman was also released yesterday afternoon. The body of the drowned Zhang San is temporarily kept at the Nanshi morgue. The workers will send representatives this morning to meet with company officials, demanding punishment for the perpetrator and compensation for funeral expenses and pensions.</p>
<h3>Changde Ship Unloaded Cargo the Other Day; Cargo Reportedly Released; Conditions Unknown</h3>
<p>After negotiations by various companies, the four foreign ships, including the Baoli, that were detained in Yangshupu after arriving in Shanghai from Zhejiang, the Baoli and Anmanli ships, were released after unloading their cargo last week. It is now known that the Italian Changde ship also unloaded its cargo at the Yangshupu wharf the other day. According to well-informed sources in the shipping industry, after several rounds of negotiations, an agreement has been reached regarding the cargo detained on each ship. The Japanese side has allowed each company to retrieve all of its cargo. As for the specific conditions, they are unknown to outsiders. The Portuguese ship Avimari has not yet unloaded its cargo due to unsuccessful negotiations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Thugs Run Rampant; 47 Deported; All Impersonating Military Police and Other Titles; Victims' Losses Reach Hundreds of Thousands</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, recently, various individuals have been impersonating Japanese military police, military police secret agents, translators, or using the military police as a cover to engage in various crimes such as intimidation, fraud, kidnapping, extortion, and freeloading. This activity is extremely prevalent, causing many victims among law-abiding Japanese residents and Chinese people in China. The Japanese military police authorities believe that these actions damage the reputation of the Japanese army. Therefore, they are vigorously investigating and decisively punishing such criminals. From January to April of this year, as many as 47 people have been ordered to return to Japan. The total value of losses to victims is over 300,000 yuan in legal tender and 150,000 yuan in military scrip. Three cases are listed below to illustrate the others.</p>
<p>Investigating Secrets; Intimidation and Fraud</p>
<p>Sonoda Kurazo, a broker in Washington Lane, Qiujiang Road (age 38), heard that a merchant was secretly transporting gold from the interior to Shanghai. He then impersonated military police to intimidate him and demanded 2,000 yuan in "movement fees." He obtained 1,080 yuan at the time. Later, when the merchant was arrested for secretly transporting gold, Sonoda claimed to his family that he could arrange for his release, thereby defrauding them of 250 yuan. In early May, the military police detected this and investigated him.</p>
<p>Collecting Money Under False Pretenses; Extravagant Spending</p>
<p>Onouchi Seijika (age 35) of 235 Jiaxing Road, acquired the public concession's rights to collect night soil in mid-November of last year, upon the order of the military police. He then fraudulently obtained 81,000 yuan under this guise, spending it all on entertainment venues. The military police investigated and exposed him in March of this year.</p>
<p>Colluding With Chinese; Kidnapping and Extortion</p>
<p>Gotō Kaneji, a trader (age 29) of Hengfeng Lane, Shigaota Road, colluded with Chinese worker Fang Zhicai. On March 4th and 5th of this year, they impersonated military police and went to the Yideli (transliteration) factory, which was run by Chinese people. They falsely claimed that the factory's products were substandard and arrested two of the factory's employees, illegally detaining them and demanding 5,000 yuan for their release. The military police learned of this and investigated them. Therefore, the requested ransom was not obtained. In addition, there were many other incidents. Therefore, the authorities hope that the general public, both Chinese and Japanese, will pay attention.</p>
<p>Statement by Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>After the above cases occurred, the military police, to prevent future occurrences, in addition to rigorously cracking down on these activities, also hope that the general public and the authorities will cooperate. On the afternoon of the 15th, the Japanese authorities also issued a statement as follows: "Recently, incidents of individuals impersonating military police secret agents, translators, or using the military police as a cover to engage in various illegal activities have frequently occurred locally. These actions damage the reputation of the Japanese army, which is deeply regrettable. Among these criminals, there are Japanese and Chinese. They exploit the weaknesses of the victims to achieve their desires. The general public, due to selfishness and self-interest, are swayed by their malicious words. Therefore, to prevent future occurrences, it is hoped that the general public will pay attention. It is best to maintain regular contact with the military police. If any of the above incidents occur and their actions are deemed inappropriate, immediately notify the military police without giving them money. Furthermore, Japanese military police, whether in uniform or plainclothes, carry service identification cards, so their identity is extremely clear."</p>
<h3>"Climb No More" Bedbug Powder and Liquid Sell Briskly</h3>
<p>The "Climb No More Bedbug Powder" and "Climb No More Bedbug Liquid" produced by Guoxin Company are highly effective in killing bedbugs and have long been famous and widely praised. With the arrival of summer, bedbugs are rampant. The company's retail stores and various distributors, including company pharmacies, department stores, and tobacco shops, are busier than ever. Large quantities are also being shipped to out-of-town customers. However, it has been learned that imitation products with similar names have appeared on the market. The company has issued a solemn notice to users, urging them to carefully identify the "Climb No More" three characters when purchasing, paying attention to the characters "Climb" and "More", to avoid being deceived.</p>
<h3>Tracing a Black-Plate Car; Notification 7182</h3>
<p>Within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple police station in Shanghai's West, a black-plate car with the number 7182, carrying several people and firearms, sped past at midnight yesterday. A patrol officer saw the vehicle and suspected its behavior. He attempted to intercept it but was unable to do so due to its excessive speed. Afterwards, the police chief notified all stations to trace the vehicle with that number.</p>
<h3>A Summer Gallery Tour</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>One clear afternoon, I entered the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road with excitement. Climbing to the second floor, I found many visitors had arrived before me. After signing my name, I was greeted by Miss Wu Yuanyi, a student of Mr. Zhang [Shichuan], and I enjoyed a full view of the works of Mr. Zhang and his students.</p>
<p>Miss Wu said that some of Mr. Zhang's works have already been collected by people from all walks of life, and they were specially borrowed for this exhibition. In total, Mr. Zhang's works include oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and pencil drawings. What I remember will be described separately below. Omissions are inevitable, but fortunately, the exhibition will continue until the 19th, so readers can carefully appreciate them.</p>
<p>The first oil painting that caught my eye was a huge one called "Compassion." From a distance, it was impossible to distinguish the visitors from the people in the painting. No wonder so many people were gathered in front of it, reluctant to leave. "Remnants of the Past" is also one of Mr. Zhang's masterpieces. Another one is "Unfinished Creation," in which the people in the painting carry their wives, children, and luggage, looking hurried and haggard, fleeing for their lives among corpses strewn across the ground. Behind them, firelight illuminates the collapsing buildings, creating a sense of terror that evokes a special feeling. Another eye-catching painting is "The Eve of Retreat," a work Mr. Zhang created when he was abroad. There are also "Holy Temple Aura" and "Cold Alley," which cause people to be deep in thought. Still lifes include "Fine Wine and Beautiful Women," which has profound meaning and serves as a warning to the world.</p>
<p>Several of the watercolors are Mr. Zhang's works from his time in Rome, such as "Sunset Over Ancient Castle," "Where Art Convenes," and "Ancient Relics." They have an ancient charm and a different exotic flavor. In today's world of rapid change, these paintings are certainly even more valuable. Still lifes include "Drunken Crabs," which are painted so realistically that anyone who likes this dish will drool at the sight of them!</p>
<p>The sculptures include portraits of Mr. Tian You and Father Rao. There are also several pencil drawings.</p>
<p>Finally, I went to see a part of the works of Mr. Zhang's top students. There was Miss Wu Yuanyi's charcoal sketch, [missing text] portrait, as well as oil paintings, etc., Mr. Tang Zhu's sculptures, Mr. Tian Ran's pencil drawings, and the wonderful works of Mr. Meng Muyi, Mr. Liu Xucang, and Mr. Liu Shunhua. It was truly a dazzling array of beautiful things. After enjoying them all, I also brought back two colorfully printed oil prints.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Zhang is not very willing to paint two completely identical works, so those who ordered them later were often disappointed. One foreign lady selected three paintings, but all had already been reserved by those who were quick to act, so she sighed with regret.</p>
<p>When I said goodbye to Miss Wu, it was 5:30, which was the time for the second showing at the Grand Cathay Theater. However, on the stairs of the YMCA, the people visiting were still coming up in an endless stream, which shows how deeply Mr. Zhang's works touch people!</p>

<h3>Suspect Released in Postal Office Robbery Case; Cashier Released Who Was Escorting the Funds; Kunming Headquarters Makes No Statement on Case</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Postal Administration's major robbery case, the Japanese military police solved the case and recovered the original stolen goods, but the postal office has not yet counted them. One of the six suspects from the Savings and Remittance Bureau, who were detained by the Japanese to escort the funds, has been released. A Datong News Agency reporter has learned the truth, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Senior Official of Savings and Remittance Bureau Released Yesterday</p>
<p>According to information learned by a Datong News Agency reporter, Wang Xuchu, the Chief of the Disbursement Section of the Savings and Remittance Bureau who was escorting the funds, as well as three veteran staff members and two bodyguards, had been detained by the Japanese at the old site of the Yong'an Silver Company in Hongkou for some time. Yesterday, the Japanese military police released Wang Xuchu, the Chief of the Disbursement Section of the Savings and Remittance Bureau.</p>
<p>Five Suspects Still Detained in Hongkou</p>
<p>The Japanese military police stated that the interrogation of the remaining three veteran staff members and one bodyguard who are still detained is complete and that they will all be released within a few days. As for the stolen funds of two million yuan held by the Japanese, the Postal Administration estimates that they can be returned and counted when the five suspects are released in full. Because the case has now come to an end, the bureau has now sent Inspector Okada to contact the Japanese side to prepare.</p>
<p>Headquarters Remains Silent on Case</p>
<p>Director General Zha Peilin of the Administration has reported the progress of the case to the Kunming Postal Administration, but the Headquarters has remained silent throughout and has not sent any instructions to the Bureau. Director General Zha will likely wait until the stolen funds have been counted in full before submitting a detailed report to the Headquarters for review.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery of Tobacco Shop's Remittance; Over 40,000 Yuan; Near Racecourse Road and Dagu Road</h3>
<p>At approximately 9:20 AM yesterday morning, Dongchang Tobacco Shop at 121 Dagu Road in the Public Concession had a large bundle made of Old Knife Brand cigarette paper, containing 44,000 yuan in cash accumulated from daily sales, and sent veteran clerk Gui Chu (age 32, from Ningbo) on a tricycle to the Bank of China at 50 Hankou Road. At the same time, trainee Hong Yongsong was sent with the remittance slip in a rickshaw to escort him. Unexpectedly, while traveling through the bamboo fence section of Racecourse Road and Dagu Road, they were suddenly ambushed by six robbers hiding nearby. Four of the robbers, each holding a handgun, ordered them to remain silent and robbed them of the entire 44,000 yuan in cash. They fled with the loot. Liu and Hong, caught off guard, were at a loss and stunned. They then regained their senses and shouted for help and gave chase. The patrol officer at the scene heard the alarm and rushed over, blowing his whistle and giving chase. As a result, one robber was apprehended and a handgun and two bullets were seized on the spot. The other five robbers escaped without a trace. The patrol officer took the captured robber and the weapons to the police station, and summoned Liu Gui Chu and Hong Yongsong to the station to investigate the robbery and track down the other robbers.</p>
<h3>Forgetting to Close the Car Door Leads to Death</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 12th of this month at 2:30 PM, an unidentified man in his forties, holding fresh meat, was riding trolley car No. 81 of the French Concession Line 1 from west to east on Avenue Joffre. As it approached No. 442, a commotion broke out inside the car, and passengers rushed to avoid each other. At that time, the car door was not tightly closed, and the man, who was drowsy, was pushed out of the car and fatally injured. It has been learned that the deceased was Wang Songlin, age 46, from Ningbo, who supported himself by selling meat at a stall on Gansidong Road and lived at No. 5 Sanduo Lane, Jiaozhou Road. The family identified the body and claimed it for burial yesterday. The police believe that the ticket seller in the car was negligent at the time and did not close the car door, resulting in death due to professional negligence. After summoning the family for investigation, they were dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Dahua Woolen Mill Products Approved for Domestic Sales</h3>
<p>The "Shepherd Circle" trademark national woolen cloth and serge produced by Dahua Woolen Weaving Co., Ltd. in Shanghai has always been welcomed by people from all walks of life. Previously, it was mistakenly listed among the factories whose domestic sales were prohibited. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has investigated and approved the cancellation of the ban on the company's products. It is said that after this, merchants dealing in woolen cloth will actively purchase the product.</p>
<h3>Using Bombs to Intimidate Entertainment Venues; Mastermind Identified; Three Accomplices Arrested Yesterday in Pudong; Many Dance Halls Extorted for Protection Money</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that it has been revealed that a criminal gang in Shanghai is using terrorist tactics to extort protection money from theaters. Detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police have obtained leads and arrested two members of the gang in Pudong yesterday afternoon (the 15th). They are currently being held in the police station. It has been learned that the gang sent a letter to the Grand Shanghai Theater, which was bombed last Friday, demanding protection money. The theater sent someone to deliver the money to Pudong. Detectives from the Xinzha police station, who were investigating the case, posed as representatives of the theater and went to negotiate, taking the opportunity to arrest three criminals. The three criminals have confessed that the second bombing of the Grand Shanghai Theater was carried out by them. The gang is led by a Korean and has henchmen spread throughout the city, specializing in extorting money from dance halls and other entertainment venues run by Chinese people.</p>
<p>It is believed that the Grand Shanghai Theater did not pay protection money, resulting in two bombings in the past week, both committed by the gang. The police in both concessions have received reports from several dance halls and are continuing to investigate. It has been learned that a dance hall on Yuqiaqing Road is paying as much as 400 yuan in protection money per day, and has been doing so for a month. Other entertainment venues in both concessions are paying this protection money for the sake of peace and quiet. The number is not small.</p>
<h3>Six Criminals Arrested in Yellow River Road Bombing Case</h3>
<p>After receiving a confidential tip from an informant, the French police immediately dispatched detectives to the Public Concession, where they joined forces with Chinese and Western detectives and arrested six criminals at the address. Two handguns, one fake handgun, and dozens of bullets were seized. It was learned that the criminals, at approximately 10:00 PM on the 25th of last month, attempted to carry bombs to Hengfeng Silk Shop in the Eight Immortals Bridge area to intimidate and extort money, but were unsuccessful. They then carried the bombs to the Zhouchuang Silk Shop at 34 Yellow River Road for temporary storage. They were careless when placing the bombs, which detonated immediately, injuring two women and one man, and killing one woman. The police station is paying close attention to this case and is secretly investigating the accomplices at large to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong, the area here, and the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island are experiencing high heat, humidity, localized thunderstorms, or fog, with gentle easterly winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 4:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai reached a high of 79.9 and a low of 65.3. On the same day last year, the temperature reached a high of 80.8 and a low of 68.5.</p>

<h3>War Causes Child Crime to Skyrocket</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>According to an investigation by the British Home Office, the number of child crime cases in the UK in the first four months of 1941 increased by 50% compared to the same period last year. Although there are no detailed statistics available recently, it is believed that the number will not decrease. Due to the war, children's sweet homes have been destroyed in bombings, their relatives have been killed or have left, leaving them unattended, displaced, and destitute. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that the number of crimes has increased.</p>
<p>The British government's remedy is to keep schools open as usual and avoid arbitrary closures. In addition, they also know that simply having children study hard will not achieve good results. Therefore, they are urging local authorities to set up more children's parks, public playgrounds, and children's clubs as much as possible so that they can still have opportunities for physical and mental development after school and after meals.</p>

<h3>Gorky's Courage and Diligence</h3>
<p>— Lu He</p>
<p>Once, Gorky and three or four companions were listening to an old woman telling the story of the hunter Galenin. She said, "Galenin was an old man with white hair and terrible eyes who died not long ago. His coffin was not buried underground. Every night, it seems like the old man gets up from his coffin and walks among the graves because he was a magician." As she was saying this, one of the companions rebuked her for lying, and the old woman's son, Floruk, came and said, "Can you sleep there at night? If you lie on the grave and sleep until dawn, I will give you twenty kopecks." So this companion blushed timidly and retreated to the corner. Floruk laughed self-satisfiedly, and the other friends slowly walked away. Floruk then said sarcastically, "Go there, coward! I thought you were street fighters at first, but you are all mice!" At this time, Gorky was unconvinced and couldn't hold back his anger. He had a strong personality, and he felt very humiliated by this ridicule. He walked up to Floruk angrily and said loudly, "Give me a ruble, and I'll go." They agreed on the condition that Gorky lie on the grave until dawn or sit there until dawn without leaving. If the coffin shook or old Galenin came back to life, he was not allowed to leave. Jumping off meant losing. So Gorky went to the grave that night and lay down with a blanket. Floruk and his friends threw rocks to scare him, but he saw through them and was not surprised at all. When dawn came, everyone asked him, "Was there anything strange?" He replied, "What's strange!" His childhood courage was beyond the reach of some adults.</p>
<p>Gorky lived in the home of his master, the pattern designer, and studied very diligently. When his masters were asleep, he would quietly get up and read, walking to the window where the moonlight shone directly on the window. But the small print was too small for his eyesight to see clearly. After thinking for a moment, he took down a copper hand pot from the shelf. The moonlight reflected from it onto the book, making it even more blurry and unclear, even worse than without it. At that time, he ran to the shop and stood under the lamp in front of the idol to read the book. But after tiring, he dozed off in the shop and was discovered by his old stepmother, who beat him until he was covered in red welts. Sometimes he would light a candle at night and study hard, but when the elderly landlady found out, she would tear up the paintings. He tried all kinds of ingenious methods, but he had no candles and no money to buy them. He had to take the remnants of candles from the candlestick, put them in a tin can, pour in some lamp oil, and put in a wick. The fire was flickering and dying, but even though it was inconvenient, he persevered and read many books. This is truly comparable to our country's stories of "catching fireflies in a bag," "reading by the reflection of snow," "hanging from the beams," "carving a hole to get light," and "not peeking into the garden," both Chinese and Western examples. No wonder he eventually became a great writer!</p>
<p>Occupation</p>
<h3>He Died of Illness</h3>
<p>— Xia Yin</p>
<p>In the morning, work started at five o'clock. The female workers trickled into the factory. They all had worried faces, opened tired and hungry eyes, and worked listlessly in the vast factory.</p>
<p>As usual, when I walked into the office, my head became involuntarily dizzy. The work was so heavy! There used to be seven accounting staff in the factory, but now there are only three, in order to save expenses. One is the director, who does nothing at all; the other is an old man in his sixties who has a special relationship with the factory, and I have to help him with everything. I am simply doing the entire accounting job.</p>
<p>Not long after work started, a commotion came from the factory floor. I immediately ran out as if flying, and heard them whispering in sympathetic and pitying voices:</p>
<p>"His life is probably in danger!"</p>
<p>"Poor man, his whole family of four depends on him!"</p>
<p>It turned out that a worker from the second drying room had suddenly fallen ill and had already been taken to the hospital. The symptoms were very dangerous.</p>
<p>"This person was originally very strong, but since he started working in the drying room, he has become weaker and weaker day by day, and his face has become withered, yellow, and terrible. His family..." They continued to tell the story.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to listen any longer, sighed, and quietly walked away. Yes, whether it's spring, summer, autumn, or winter, if a person works hard day and night in a high-temperature drying room, how can he not be suffocated? As I thought about this, my heart began to ache. Is my youthful vitality also gradually disappearing?</p>
<p>After a while, the expected news came: the person died before being taken to the hospital. In the office, the manager and senior staff were discussing:</p>
<p>"He died of illness, it's none of our business."</p>
<p>"Seeing that he's pitiful, just give him ten yuan for funeral expenses!"</p>
<p>Unease and anger filled my heart. After I record this funeral expense, I also have to record those so-called official expenses:</p>
<p>"Expenses for Mr. So-and-so's dinner party: one hundred yuan"</p>
<p>"Expenses for Mr. So-and-so's trip to Hong Kong: five hundred yuan"</p>
<p>"Mr. So-and-so's entertainment expenses: two hundred yuan."</p>
<p>I know very well that those expenses are entirely for personal matters. Renting rooms, going to dance halls, playing mahjong, gambling with cards, indulging in extravagance, just hiding it from the manager. But for the unfortunate dead worker, his life is cheaper than yellow mud.</p>
<p>"He died of illness, it's none of our business." The manager's smug voice echoed in my ears.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) A Strange Peasant</p>
<p>This isn't to say that he has any special connection to the wet nurse herself or her family, requiring them to stay together forever; in reality, this is just a simple matter. Because when people are together, whether they are parents and children, husband and wife, siblings, colleagues, or master and servant…, as long as they've been together for a particularly long time, it's inevitable that a special kind of feeling will develop, and once they hear they have to separate, everyone's heart will feel somewhat empty and uneasy. Moreover, Begonia is originally a very sensitive person.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the pit, lowered his head, and couldn't say anything for a long time; Little Meibao's nimble eyes kept darting around on his short, disheveled hair.</p>
<p>"Dad, are they really going…! Going back? Bao Bao will be alone at home…and won't have a playmate anymore! Mom isn't coming back either…" After she said this, she couldn't help but start sobbing.</p>
<p>Her crying made Begonia's heart even more troubled.</p>
<p>He wanted to go out immediately and ask Wang Si and the wet nurse, but in the past few months, the expression on the couple's faces and the private conversations they had revealed were enough to prove that what Little Meibao said was very likely, so what was the point of asking them?</p>
<p>"Good child, go to sleep! Dad will go and ask them tomorrow." After forcibly calming himself down, he tried his best to urge Meibao to go to sleep.</p>
<p>He himself walked back and forth in the room, and the agitation of his thoughts made him feel more uncomfortable than seasickness; in fact, among these fluctuating thoughts, the strongest undercurrent was still his never-forgotten Xiangqi from the past few years.</p>
<p>In these past few years, he has told everyone that Meibao's mother died in Tianjin, and the only people who know that she is not dead and that he is constantly thinking of her are Meibao and the wet nurse. (134)</p>
<p>Military Affairs</p>
<h3>Reveille's Disturbance</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>People who have received military training generally have a feeling that one of the most annoying and difficult things to get used to is having to get up as soon as they hear the reveille in the early morning. At this time, the sky is still dark, and all around is hazy. If it is in winter, the cold wind is even more biting, making people uncomfortable. This difficult moment is something that even the most veteran soldiers find difficult to deal with. Sometimes, they even mistakenly think that the sound of the bugle is part of a good dream, and continue to sleep soundly.</p>
<p>Recently, the bugler in the military camp at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, USA, had a stroke of genius and suddenly came up with an idea: he invented blowing the bugle on a loudspeaker, so that the soldiers in the camp could all jump up. According to him, the mess call doesn't need to be blown so loud.</p>
<h3>A Peculiar Custom of Courtship</h3>
<p>— Zeng Xiu</p>
<p>The women of the Yugoslav ethnic group have a peculiar custom of courtship, which can be said to be unbelievable. They dig up a piece of soil from the place where their lovers have walked and left footprints, and put it in a flowerpot. Then they plant a marigold in that flowerpot—they believe that this plant will never wither. As the golden flowers of the marigold gradually grow and never fade, their lovers' love also gradually grows and never fades. The soil from the places where lovers have walked will facilitate pair after pair of happy couples, and the Old Man in the Moon should naturally retreat three times.</p>

<h3>After Watching "A Dream in an Ancient Temple"</h3>
<p>— Qian Di</p>
<p>The Yiyou Society specially invited Mr. Afu Xiamoluo, a "China Expert," to lead the Chinese Drama and Dance Troupe to perform his carefully crafted work "A Dream in an Ancient Temple" at the Lyceum, with the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra providing accompaniment, in order to raise funds for the Yiyou Hospital. There were over ten male and female actors, and they originally performed Peking Opera at the Tianchan, Huangjin, Carlton, Gongwutai, Datutai, and Jiexi Theaters.</p>
<p>Here, let me write down some of the content of the story, as well as my thoughts after watching it.</p>
<p>If we were to say that we went to see this play entirely to seek fun and excitement, then you would be very disappointed, because the story of "A Dream in an Ancient Temple" is very simple. It has no fun or excitement. Originally, Mr. Afu Xiamoluo's original intention was just to use these themes as a framework for composing music; however, when standing at the pinnacle of drama and appreciating it with an artistic eye, it gives you too many benefits, so that after you've seen it, the contours of the characters in the play still linger in your mind. Their laughter, crying, hatred, and anger are as if you yourself are performing in this way, as if your closest thousands upon thousands of friends are performing in this way.</p>
<p>The first act is a setting of an ancient temple, with an old monk sitting on the side and a Thousand-Hand Guanyin in the middle. The plot is that Miss Huiyun, accompanied by a maid, comes out to worship Guanyin. In the second act, Lian has a nightmare, and then sees two suitors dueling with a demon one after another. As a result, Piyong (a frivolous young man) loses, and Minyong (a loyal young man) wins. The third act takes place in a garden, where many people celebrate Minyong's victory with acting, and the lovers finally get married.</p>
<p>Zhang Meilin, who plays Huilian, is very gentle in terms of body, stage steps, and expressions. Cui Yanfang's leadership of the Thousand-Hand Guanyin, with five people lined up in a row, making various hand gestures, is extremely skilled. Xu Futing's Demon King, with his terrifying makeup, is extremely evil! Black marks are drawn on the hands and feet of the four demons, which symbolizes the horror of the demons and is just right. Piyong's staff twirling is fast and rapid, rapid and fast, it's really a case of "only seeing the staff flowers, not seeing the person." Minyong's knifeplay is powerful, skillful, and quite extraordinary. In addition, Zhang Liankui, who plays the monk Zhihe, and Ma Xiurong and Cao Lixia, who play the little maids, also put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>What we are worth mentioning is that it is said that when those actors first started training, they didn't understand the director's language and didn't understand the rhythm of Western music. They only relied on shouting "one, two, three, four" and painstakingly studying. Now, after seven months, they are meeting the audience. Every move they make is in rhythm, and they can express the actions of the face, hands, and feet according to the high and low of the music, and express "happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy." When the music is playing, you will hear all kinds of brave, cowardly, desolate, and tragic sounds. These sounds seem to be coming from the actors' toes—light and lively. The high notes of the violin in the second act, along with the soft sobbing of the trumpet, made my emotions uncontrollable. I doubted whether I was in another world at this moment.</p>
<p>Replacing language with musical rhythm and explaining the story with the expression of movements is a highlight of Chinese dance dramas. This play may not be acceptable to the general superficial audience who are looking for fun and excitement. However, I admire Mr. Afu and Moluofu's hard work, and believe that they have made the greatest efforts to promote ancient Chinese art.</p>
<h3>Art Scene Stroll</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shen</p>
<p>Wei Ruhui, the author of "Hong Xiannu," recently wrote an ancient costume script for the Shanghai Drama Society, entitled: "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." The play is scheduled to be staged during the Qiqiao Festival in the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>In "Qing Palace Grievances," which is about to be staged by the Tianfeng Drama Society, Yin will play Consort Zhen, and Shu Di will play Emperor Guangxu. As for the most important role in the whole play, the Empress Dowager Cixi, it was originally intended to be played by Lan Lan, but it is said that Lan Lan has declined because of poor health. Dafeng intends to hire Bo Li to fill the role.</p>
<p>Yiren Jiangfei has recently been directing "Ren Zhi Chu" for "Zhongzhi Yi" and is quite busy. It is said that the play will be performed at the Russian Art Theater this month.</p>
<p>Chang Shaoyue, the host of the Modern Film and Drama Actors' School, is enthusiastic about promoting woodcuts and has established the ABC Woodcut School Correspondence Class to train woodcut talents. It is said that the registration office is located at No. 14 Yong'an Lane, Xindagu Road, Tongfu Road.</p>
<p>Shi Hui, the protagonist of "Song of Righteousness," and Tai Shen, who plays Tai Shen, almost fainted when the Sunday market was about to end. Later, after a doctor gave him an injection, he reluctantly took the stage for the night market. It is said that although the box office for "Song of Righteousness" is good, the performance period may have to be shortened to the 15th of this month in order to regulate the actors' spirits and wait for the autumn to cool down before performing again.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11 A Valiant Appearance in a Fierce Battle</p>
<p>At this time, the atmosphere in Daizhou had changed again. Outside the city, it was cold and desolate, with few pedestrians, and every household was closed. Many of the Bai people who lived near the city had already moved into the city. On the city walls, banners and flags fluttered, spears and halberds stood in rows, and many soldiers patrolled back and forth along the walls. The city gates were also half-open and half-closed, with soldiers guarding them. At this time, a scouting horse galloped like a shooting star. When Xu Jing went forward to inquire, the scout said breathlessly: "The rebels are only thirty miles away from the city." Xu Jing was greatly surprised, feeling that the rebels were using their troops too quickly. He hurriedly followed into the city, went straight to the general's yamen, dismounted in front of the yamen gate, and went to visit Zhou Yuji. At this time, Wang Yongtai and deputy generals Zhang Lie, Fan Cheng, and others were all present. Xu Jing greeted them one by one and sat down on the side. Zhou Yuji first asked: "Why didn't Liu Yinying come?" Xu Jing said: "This humble officer was summoned by the general, and originally, Lord Liu intended to come. But he had to discuss it with his aunt before he could start out, and he also had some private matters to deal with, so he let this humble officer come to receive orders first. He asked me to convey to the general that he will definitely be able to come to the camp to serve within a few days." Zhou Yuji nodded and said: "Very well, we must work together to repel the rebels and protect this place, so as to avoid the devastation of the people." He then told them about the rampant nature of the rebels. Xu Jing then learned that Li Zicheng and other large groups of bandits had captured Taiyuan, the provincial capital, Jin Wang Qiugui was captured, and the provincial governor Cha Maode and others had also died in battle. The rebels had successively captured Licheng, Linjin, Lu'an, and other places, and were heading straight for Daizhou with great momentum, and had become a prairie fire. Now that they are dividing their troops into three routes to attack, they should not be underestimated. Xu Jing then asked: "According to the general's high opinion, which should come first, battle or defense?" Zhou Yuji smiled slightly and said: "We must be able to fight before we can defend. If they surround us on all sides, even if we can defend, but we have no food inside and no reinforcements outside, we will fail sooner or later. Therefore, my plan is to fight first. When their vanguard arrives, we will send out elite soldiers to give them a head-on blow. If we can win, it will also make the rebels suffer a setback and boost our morale. I have already talked with the old hero Wang. He is willing to lead his men out to fight. This general will follow up and respond, to test the strength of the rebels. (91)</p>
