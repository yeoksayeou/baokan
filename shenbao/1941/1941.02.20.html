<h3 id="c9">土保宣言 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>對於今日的巴爾幹，再不能與廿五年前等量齊觀了。蓋較之廿五年前，今日的蘇聯已經不是此際歐戰角逐中的正面主角，而今日的土耳其，雖領十較曩昔爲小，然實力增强，且具有獨立堅定的對外立塲：故所謂巴爾幹是歐洲的火藥庫一語，顯已較前另具不同的意義。其間存在的種種對立關係，較前更爲錯雜繁複；其間潛在的均勢，並無穩定的基礎；以是伸入其間的各個勢力，既不容一意孤行，更談不到左右局勢，彼此都隱具戒心，如非迫不得已，總不肯輕率有所舉動。這一决即使沒有義大利不度德量力而貿貿然對希臘發動了失敗的傑作，然而厝火之上的巴爾幹，其形式上的和平相安，亦未必不能繼續保持到此際；這也就是義軍慘敗已近三月，而納粹尙遲遲不肯赴援的原因之一。</p>
<p>德國之不願把巴爾幹化爲戰塲，自有極顯明的理由；但他却始終處心積慮，企圖運用外交，把當地若干小國爭取到自己的營壘。已經入彀的羅馬尼亞不消說了、此際的保加利亞與南斯拉夫以至與英具有互助關係的土耳其，都是德方此一外交攻勢下的主要對象。不論其用意在於穩定後方，抑或挽回頹勢，那都是在對英重取攻勢前的必要步驟。恰於此際，土保兩國突聯合發表互不侵犯宣言，申明互信及睦誼，自不免予世人以虞大刺激，並引起種種不同的感應。</p>
<p>專就巴爾幹一隅本身而論，一向隔閡而且相互戒備着的土保兩國，於危疑震撼之際而能彼此接近，互示信任，未嘗不是値得欣幸的事；而此際之所以引起重大惶慮者，無非因爲：（一）有義希戰爭的存在，（二）保國對於納粹的接近，（三）德軍準備假道保境進攻希臘的風傳；以致雖然該宣言中有「並不影響兩國在條的上所負之義務」的明文規定，却不能减輕世人對於希臘命運以至英國在東地中海戰略地位的惶慮，不禁對於土國此一熊度步驟表示惋惜。至於這一新塲面的本質與後果，究竟如何，各方見仁見智，各具理解；因此要想把握此一未來趨勢，却亦更感困難。所得體認明白的，今日的巴爾幹對於歐局現勢，並不具有最後決定的意義，而其間種種力量的複雜微妙則益甚於前。試加剖析，探討其蹤跡趨歸，則其間大可注竟者：第一，雖然最近德軍在羅保進行軍事佈置的消息頻傳，但無論如何，納粹始終並不利於東南歐戰事的蔓延和擴大；假如說，德方是準備以在巴爾幹的軍事行動響應未來對英倫的攻勢並分散英國注意力，可是無論如何，德軍在那一方面的行動實無從對英作致命的打擊；不但如此，他自已的前哨綫放長了，亦即分散了自方的兵力，並使其石油與食糧倉庫的羅馬尼亞有遭受襲擊破壞之虞。然則這一戰略，究竟是拙笨，還是鋒利，尙屬疑問。第二，以蘇聯而言，前曾力勸土耳其擺脫援英義務，去冬並阻止保加利亞的參加軸心，凡此用意，無非在於不使黑海門戶以至東南歐洲被戰禍所波及；假若蘇方對於此度土保談判亦曾與聞的話，亦必採取着同樣立塲，而絕不是幫助軸心方面之向黑海與愛琴海發展闢一通路。第三，在土耳其最所關切的，當無過於韃靼尼爾與博斯波魯兩海峽以至伊士坦波爾的怎樣减輕威脅，這也就是英土兩國在近東能夠合作的主耍根據；而土方之所以關切希臘，同時也是爲了保衛自身，設若德國勢力侵人薩羅尼加，當不難想像土國當如何震動。於此亦可信土當局斷不致爲了博取對保的和平共處而對於德方之向愛琴海黑海入口的發展，優容坐視。第四，義軍的侵犯希臘，土耳其並未履行援希的義務；此度土保的不侵宣言中，也沒有阻止保國向希索取領土的傾向；但是其間鄭重標明不影響對第三國條的義務一語，明示了土耳其對希義務仍舊存在；至於宣言之後，將怎樣調和及運用，於此二者之間，猶待覘之於土當局此後的動向。僅憑宣言，不夠判斷。而其特別聲言英土軍事條的的依舊有效，則至少明白表示並未走向與英仳離的途徑。根據這四項認識，可見土保此舉固非「民治國之勝利」，也不能遽視爲軸心國獲得何種可恃的成就。其對於巴爾幹整個局勢的影響，除却减輕兩國間猜忌敵對因而間接縮小東南歐洲紛擾範圍而外。其是否會引起何種新的變動，還須視那一方面各個勢力的未來關係及消長而定；這在目前，最値得注意的，莫如緊跟着這一塲面之後，德國如何活動，德保關係如何演進。推想德國關於這一作爲的目標，我們並不估量之奇高；除了當然的不外乎擴張勢力，而其所亟，還在敦促希義停戰，以及杜塞今後英國在東南歐方面發動可能的陸上攻勢。總之，這在整個國際的局勢之中，自成甚可注意的一環，却非極關重要的一環；若謂這在太平洋危機的主角，將因此而獲致，正中彼懷的興波作浪的機會，則機會所給他的，當爲又是一度望梅畫餅而已。</p>

<p>新生活運動七週年紀念　蔣會長廣播演講詞</p>
<p>重慶　（續昨）若將道七年來前後作一個精密的對比、就不能不認我國各方面的進步之大了、回想新生活運動發動之初、對我們嫉視和詆毀的人、他們說這是「排日運動的結果」、又說這不過是中國人「五分鐘熱度的再演」、他們忌嫉這一個運動、深恐這一運動的推行、將爲我們復興運動的始基、而將予他們的野心以最大打擊、現在譏剌我們的、已證明其估量錯誤、而其所嫉忌防範的、則已使他們身受最嚴重的迎頭的敎訓了、至於國內一般人士、在當時也多懷疑觀望、以爲禦侮衛國、重在實力、這種新運不是當務之急、更有許多喪失民族自信心的人士、祇知道</p>
<p>好高鶩遠標新立異、忘却了我們自身歷史和民族固有的精神、因而任意非難、有的說禮義廉恥太陳舊了、有的甚至說恢復禮義廉恥四維、乃是一種後退的復古遝動、引我們所提倡的新生活爲笑柄、爲頑固、但是現在經過了三年的</p>
<p>事實敎訓允其是在三年半的作戰中間、一切前方後方、我們老幼同胞、不怕死、不畏雞、忠勇節烈的犧牲奮鬭、那一件不是禮義廉恥固有精神的表現、所以到了今天、不但再沒有人反對禮義廉恥的心理、而且莫不確認禮義廉恥爲立國的基本、救國的　道了、我們</p>
<p>一般國民過去精神萎靡、思想錯亂、心理懦怯、現在則活力日兒吒盛、步伐日趨整齊、自信日益堅强、於是已往所謂「禮義掃地」、「廉恥蕩然」、被人侮蔑爲一盤散沙的國民、現在已逐漸漸成了團結一致、生氣蓬勃、戰鬭的勇士、大家一致在抗建的大綱之下、</p>
<p>充分表現我們民族發揚蹈厲、與勇往邁進的新精神、同胞們、祇要把七年前後的情形比一比、就知道道種不知不覺的進步、正是我們對日作戰最重要的力量、我們在這四十四個月自衛戰爭之中、使日軍死傷了一百七十萬的官兵、使他們消耗了一百八十億的軍費、這並不是全靠</p>
<p>我們武器听能打得他到這個地步的，這種成績、乃是我們前後方軍民同胞、接受了禮義廉恥的精神力量所造成的、講到這裏、我要請我們同胞、允其有領導責任的知識分子、和社會上各界領袖、撤底的想一想、今天</p>
<p>全國同胞皆認新生活運動、爲救國必由的途徑、是毫無疑問的了、但是我們每一個人、對於推行新生活運動、已經盡到最大的努力沒有、我們已經誠意接受了新生活運動的主旨和辦法、而能實行了沒有、已經使</p>
<p>這一運動普及了沒有、我要求今天聽我講演的各位、再把新生活運動綱耍之中所載的、「爲何需要新生活」、及「爲何需要新生活運動」兩節、重新檢出來念一下、更把綱要中間、新生活運動的方法檢出來看一遍、我們是不是已經做到了「由城市而漸入鄉村、由機關學校而推廣於一般的民衆</p>
<p>誠然不錯我們對新生活運動是有了相當的努力的、我們最初提倡了淸潔運動和規矩運動、而收到了若干的成效、在作戰以前、我們舉辦了集團訓練、舉辦了暑期農村服務等等工作、在作戰以後、這三年半以來、我們更致力於</p>
<p>戰地服務和後方救濟、我們舉辦了戰地胀務　、舉辦了婦女訓練、發動了兵役宣傳、和傷兵救濟運動、收養了難童、救濟了難胞的生活、推進了節約獻金、實行了空襲服務、協助了精神總動員、更推行了其他種種、於抗建有關的工作但是我們的工作</p>
<p>實際還是零星的、局部的、我們工作的攻效、還是沒有達到抗建事業所要求、祇看我們烟賭惡習還沒有根本剷除、社會頹風還沒有普遍澄消、國民精神也沒有完全振作、不僅領導新運的人員應皆自認職責未盡、一般同胞也要自認</p>
<p>努力不夠我以爲一個民族要能够振作自强、必須對外能禦侮、對內能除惡、古人說、「去山中賊易、去心中賊難」、山中賊和心中賊一樣、足以妨害社會的進步、和民族的生存、人閃民族在目前、有外在的、有形的敵人、也有內在的社會風俗上、和民族道德上的公敵、我們必須同時克服這變重的敵人我們民族纔能眞正復興、（十八電未完</p>

<p>— 崔景泰</p>
<p>年才十九歲的友人樹君，在去年暮春不幸染了急性肺病，醫藥罔效，那活躍的生命，竟遽爾被摧毀了。在他未死的不久以前，他在給我的信上說：「眼看着生命的火燄日漸微弱了，而自己却越留戀着可愛的生命。我是何等迫切地渴望着有人能來立刻救助我掙脫死的威脅啊！……」我默誦着他這慘痛的心聲，禁不住一陣心酸，淚水滴下來，把這些凄切的字句化模糊了。</p>
<p>樹臨死的時候，他的神志還和常人樣地淸醒着；看見我來，還浮起笑容來點頭招迎我。我走近他床前，他囑咐我坐得離他遠些。我勸他安靜躺着，不要多煩神說話。他不願意，他說：「我的時間有限了。我能再和你多談片刻，眞有說不出的愉快。」想來他病中的生活一定是太苦寂了。</p>
<p>「先前，我很愁無生望，我怕死得很；因爲正當我奮發有爲的時候；還有我那相依爲命的媽媽，她失去了我，往後的生活，是多麽凄凉呢！」樹的語音，在那迫促的喘息中，是極其細弱了，他猶斷續不停地說：「最近兩天來，我覺悟到自己的這種種愁慮，原都是自尋煩惱；所以我現在很是泰然。……」</p>
<p>「是啊，人生本是太幻滅了。生，老，病，死，何非也皆是夢？」我原想勸他達觀些，可是他却回答說：「不，你這話錯了；生命總是寳貴的。假使我還能强壯起來，那我一定要加倍努力向上生活，不敢再浪費時間了。你切莫辜負了生命。你還很强壯，望你要努力。……」樹的這些語音雖弱，而却是充溢了强烈的摯情，震撼了我的心靈。</p>
<p>「眞的，切莫忘了；强壯的時候要努力！人一病倒了，會失去一切的自由和幸福。」樹安靜了一刻，很費力地說：「你等我等，讓我歇一下再和你談好嗎？」他說這話時的神情，是顯得更可憫了。樹的母親在一邊，祇是痛心得涕泗交流，我也不禁飲泣起來。樹無力地搖着頭，表示勸我們不必爲他傷心。旋即閉上眼，像是又疲乏地睡熟了。</p>
<p>我想等他醒來，再向他說些使他歡心的話。可是，他已悄悄地離去人世了。和他訣別的，還有他枕邊的幾本世界名人的傳記。</p>

<p>— 木訥</p>
<p>讀完了嵐毓君的「鼓舞人的詩」，我非常感動，因爲我正是一個需要鼓舞的人，但是我也很爲嵐毓君惋惜，因爲他攷進了「以考試出名」的大學，開始一天到晚和分數搏鬥之後，爲什麽不把這首詩多念幾遍，反而把它藏了起來，以致有上畢期三樣不及格的不幸？所以我認爲有了鼓勵，假使不加善用，還是沒有用處的。爲了這，我也大膽地寫了「半」首「詩」，當作原詩的繼續：</p>
<p>假使（續）</p>
<p>假使你的搏鬥不能勝利，</p>
<p>我的勇士呀，</p>
<p>你祇是悲啼，能否擊退你的强敵？</p>
<p>這樣是不是切實一點呢？</p>
<p>臥薪嘗膽地鍛鍊，</p>
<p>不像一個懦夫般的戰慄，</p>
<p>拿起你的武器。</p>
<p>假使你得到了鼓勵，</p>
<p>但是你把它死藏起來，</p>
<p>你想它會不會賜給你勇氣，</p>
<p>使你得到最後的勝利？</p>
<p>這是不是一個有效的辦法呢？</p>
<p>雪影　烟帆作</p>
<p>我的勇士呀，</p>
<p>勇往眞前，</p>
<p>不時的激勵你自己！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>湘綺懷着滿肚子的疑問，在自己屋子裏蹀　了好半嚮，直到那癡啞丫頭再來請她進去，她還想不出是什麽一會事。</p>
<p>最奇怪的是母親的臉上已突然透出了一種很難得的光采，心裏似乎非常的高興，但坐在一張方桌邊的父親，却顯着很尷尬而且又遲疑不決的神氣；究竟是怎麽一會事，眞使湘綺百思莫解了！</p>
<p>「方才侯校長找我，去順便還會到了敎育廳的馬廳長…。」父親開始向她說。</p>
<p>「馬廳長…？」湘綺越發覺得奇怪了。給一個女師的學生介紹位置，她想無論如何也沒有驚動敎育廳長的必要。這究竟是什麽一會事啊？</p>
<p>「不錯，是馬廳長。」父親接着說：「但不是給你找位置，他們是要給你做媒的。」</p>
<p>湘綺的心開始跳起來了，但母親臉上的笑容，却已格外的明顯了。</p>
<p>「男家是熱河鎭守使袁竇藩。論他的名位是當然是無話可說的，不過年紀比你大了一些，或計…。父親感到很困難。或許你要不歡喜吧？」</p>
<p>「……」湘綺漲紅臉，沒有回答</p>
<p>「年紀大一些，只要不曾娶過親，那是沒有關係的。」母親躺在床上揷着嘴。</p>
<p>「這一點會經問過好幾次，他們都一口給我保證。」忠厚的父親，毫無疑惑地說：「並且侯校長是深知我的家境的，所以當塲已經給我說明，不久就要替我在敎育廳弄一個位置；待到綺兒正式過門之後，女婿答應在天津另外找一個公館，大家住在一起。算來件件都好，只是女婿年紀大一些，米免委屈了你。」</p>
<p>「綺兒，只要你肯答應一句話，這個月裏他們就耍行聘了。」母親的心裏似早已相當的焦急。</p>
<p>「我…是…」湘綺紅着臉，實在不好意思說什麽話。　（三五）</p>

<p>— 闌</p>
<p>在過去，一般人認爲白色能防止光綫的透入，黑色能吸收多量的光綫，是一條一定的定理。但是，在現在，由於最近學者硏究的結果，這條定理已不一定眞實。黑色並不一定能吸收多量的光綫和熱量，反之，白色都具有强烈的反射光綫的性質，亦非事實。黑色而不能吸收光綫者，其吸收光錢的程度和白色相同。</p>
<p>英國羊毛工業硏究會會長肯利甫（P．W．Cumliffe），最近發表黑色衣服未必一定溫暖的意見。用某種染料染成的黑色衣服，對於熱光綫的反射幾與白色完全相同，而夏季所用的白色衣服，（如卡其布帆布）在冬季也可以服用。</p>
<p>這種意見，係甩紅外綫攝影所測得。由此可測知各種色調的熱感覺，和各種色調的熱效果，各種色調熱綫吸收率的多寡，也就是保持熱量的程度</p>
<p>所以，黑色不一定能吸收及保持多量的熱光綫（如太陽等），反之白色小一定皆反射而不吸收熱光錢。</p>

<h3 id="c96">失業後 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 孫傑人</p>
<p>去年十月間，任職的那家公司收小範圍，我便被裁而失業。</p>
<p>失業使我受到飢寒的侵雙，使我受到人們的冷視，可是我從不恐懼，也從不作急，正和我得到失業的消息那一瞬一樣。</p>
<p>我緊縮了生活，一日三餐改成二餐，出門時用兩脚來代步；住屋由亭子間變爲擱樓，把一些塲面上的衣服賣了，穿起父親的舊襖。這樣我的衣，食，住，行，雖和以前完全不同，可是生活還是一樣的安定</p>
<p>我把公司裏給我的三月生活費，提出一半來買進些雜誌月刊等的書籍，在街口一家麵店門邊，擺一個書攤，每天得一些收入，貼補生活：我把另一半錢，作爲進夜校求學的費用，因爲我覺得沒有比這件事再迫切需要的了。我的學識還不够，現在旣有空閒，我決不放過道個求學的機會！</p>
<p>這樣的生活很愉快。雖然，平時沒有一些物質上的享受，雖然在人們的腦海中，我的地位低落，可是我的精神是快樂的。那些無聊的享樂，那些虛僞的塲面，父有什麽用處？拋棄了，又有什麽可戀呢？</p>
<p>當然，我並不想道樣長久過下去，我正在鍛鍊，正在學習，我等待着更好的機會，我是有希望和前途的！</p>

<h3 id="c97">洪深自殺前後　刺激過深神經失常　將赴粵任中大敎職 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>名戲劇家洪深於本月五日晨，在渝全家服毒消息，此間僅于翌日得一電報，茲得渝地友人來函，幷廣東特的寄稿，都爲報道洪氏自殺詳情者，茲摘錄於次：</p>
<p>洪氏雖任職文化工作委員會並兼文藝獎助金保管委員會委員，然仍鬱鬱不得志，去冬，朋友們已感覺洪氏多少有點失常態，神經似乎受刺激甚深。</p>
<p>最使洪氏痛苦的是洪氏愛女洪鈴小姐的病，洪小姐素患肺疾，現已入第三期，病情極沉重，而醫藥費父很昂貴，爲了洪小姐的病，洪氏曾舉債二千元，共間並向文藝獎助金保管委員會貸借一千元，但後來因一部分人稍有微詞，會中議決委員不得貸借，洪氏身爲委員，乃首先將一千元歸還。爲增加收入起見，洪氏近乃應中山大學文學系之聘，月薪三百，並多支六個月薪，打算於三月間前往履新</p>
<p>近二月來，洪氏本擬多寫稿子，償還債務，但心緒異常惡劣，往往舉筆不能着一字。自殺前五六日，曾對朋友道：</p>
<p>「我現在只好無聊的玩吸烟，喝酒，」又說：「我簡直一個字也寫不出來。」洪夫人常靑眞女士，對話劇運動亦頗熱心，爲了鄂東粵北的參加演戲，不惜把親生子女遠寄于香港兒童保育院，而自殺前她的情緒惡劣，亦不亞於洪氏。</p>
<p>本月五日晨，洪氏夫婦決意自殺，洪氏服多量奎寗丸，洪夫人則飲紅藥水二瓶，並留下絕命書一封，有「一切都無辦法，不如歸去，我也管不盡許多了。」等語。</p>
<p>洪氏夫婦服毒後，洪鈴小姐發覺，當卽托人打電話給郭沫若，郭氏於是偕同醫生赴賴家橋三塘院洪宅探視，至時，洪氏夫婦已昏迷不醒，當卽行緊急療治，幸發覺時間尙早，經注射後，即將毒品吐出，洪氏夫婦危險期已過，經短期間休息，即可復原，惟洪氏聽覺略差。</p>
<p>本月六日，獲得洪氏自殺之消息後，文化工作委員會即舉行會議，政治部張部長亦出席，當贈洪氏醫藥費一千元，並決定聘洪氏爲政治部設計委員，月薪二百元左右。張氏並表示，決擬定具體辦法，保障文化人及作家今後生活，但洪氏對張部長贈款，口授友人撰就辭謝文字，全部璧還，並表示友輩捐贈，一律謝絕，自謂「生性狷介，否則亦不致有今日也」云。</p>
<p>本月七日，洪氏好友田漢凌鶴等陸續赴頓家橋探視。</p>
<p>最後消息，聞洪氏表示，休養好後，卽將離渝赴粵，擔任中山大學文學系主任之職。</p>

<p>「嫁妹」爲崑曲名劇，身段唱工，備極繁重。十餘年前常見錢金福，侯益龍諸老伶工演之，今則崑弋班老伶凋謝，皮黃班凈再人材缺乏，郝壽臣陳富瑞兩人雖均能演「嫁妹」「山門」諸劇，惟一則已謝絕歌壇，一則淪爲萬壽班中之附庸，時演本戲，更無機露演矣。上海戲校敎師梁連柱君旣與富瑞有同學之誼，復知「嫁妹」一劇，爲陳君名作，（按富瑞爲崑班名宿陳壽峯之孫，其父嘉良曾充蘭芳笛師，富瑞坐科時，從葉福海先生習「嫁妹」，復加以崑曲世家之關係，故吐字甚爲正確有力。）因特再三懇商爲戲校學生王正堃張正鵬說「嫁妹」「山門」兩劇。「嫁妹」已公演數决，成績頗佳，吐火，趨馬（雖所騎爲驢，而身段則與趟馬同也。）等身段，尤有足觀，入後各鬼卒表演各種技藝，如堆疊獅，象，遊龍等，亦甚見精彩。</p>

<p>— 贊新德</p>
<p>一九四〇年的好萊塢電影，無論質和量，都不輸於一九三九年，然而在這些影片之中，美國人到底，好那一種呢，據Ore　gounian雜誌統計，從五百部影片中揀選出來，觀衆們最愛的是有情節的骨子戲劇，其次是喜劇，又其次才是冒險片和傳記片，最後才是音樂片。</p>
<p>所謂最嗜好的情節戲劇，計爲「蝴蝶夢」，「怒火之花」，「花好月圓」，「再生緣」，「香箋淚」（蓓蒂黛維絲主演，上海尙未公映）Kitty　Foyle（琴逑羅吉絲主演，上海未公映）「枇杷門巷」，及Philadelphia　Story（卡雷葛倫，凱塞琳赫本，詹姆斯史都華主演，上海未公映。）</p>
<p>最好的三個喜劇，都和婚姻問題有關。第一是「多妻秘史」，第二個是「妹妹我愛你」，第三個是上海尙未公映的This　Thing　Called　Love。其次還有兩個，則是狄斯耐的「木偶奇遇記」，和四大明星—蓋博，史本塞，拉瑪，考爾白合演的Boom　Town。此外，有兩個諷刺政治的喜劇，就是卓別林的「大獨栽者」和白拉恩唐立凡主演的「江湖異人傳」。（編者按：此片不久在國泰映過，內容甚佳，惜未爲滬人注意。）</p>
<p>關於冒險片，他們認爲量好的是Northwest　Passage　Foreign　Correspondent，「水深火熱」（上海均未映過）及不久映過的「寳劍留痕」。</p>
<p>傳記片之中，最好的是「民族精神」，「欲海慈航」，「少年安迪生」及「成人安迪生」。</p>
<p>一九四〇年不是音樂片年，只有少數出類拔萃的音樂片。最好的是「花月佳期」，「春到人間」，這兩片都是竇萍的作品，第三部是安娜妮格兒主演的「雲裳膩舞」。</p>
<p>導演之中，的翰福特，山姆伍得，和費區考克最受人推祟。Kitty　Foyle和「花好月圓」都是伍特的作品；「蝴蝶夢」和Forelgn　Correspondent　都是費區考克的心血結晶，而福特則是「怒火之花」和「水深火熱」的導演人。</p>
<p>卓別林似乎不甚爲人所重視，原因則是他在製作上，可不受時間的限制，他在十二年之中，只有四部作品。</p>
<p>最好的影片，都是由最受歡迎的小說改編，據統計，去年十分之六的片子，都採自名家作品。</p>

<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday issued a decree establishing naval defense zones around US naval bases in the Pacific, Alaska, and the Caribbean Sea. The President also issued numerous executive orders to halt commercial navigation within these zones and to prohibit aircraft, except those specifically authorized or belonging to friendly forces, from flying over these areas. It is reported that Guam and Wake Islands are also included. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt issued an order yesterday regarding US naval outposts in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas. In practical terms, this order directly warns foreign ships and aircraft that they are not permitted to enter without US permission. The order establishes defense zones on the sea and reserved airspace. No ships or aircraft, except those authorized by the US Navy, are allowed to navigate or fly within these zones. The order is effective ninety days from last Friday. This order extends the US Navy's authority to manage ship and aircraft movements beyond the already declared closed ports. The newly designated zones extend three nautical miles offshore around Culebra Island east of Puerto Rico, Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii (the location of the new naval air station), Kiska Island and Unalaska Island off Alaska, and Palmyra Island, Johnston Island, Midway Island, Wake Island, Kingman Reef, Rose Island, Tutuila Island, and Guam in the Pacific Ocean. The prohibited ports include Culebra Harbor, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Guam Harbor, Subic Bay in the Philippines, Kiska Island Harbor, and Long Beach and San Pedro harbors off the coast of California. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Military sources reported yesterday that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, and the period of greatest danger is not far off. Both sides are preparing, and armed conflict could erupt at any moment. Japan is making every effort to mobilize its military forces and concentrate them in the south, such as Saigon, which is very close to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. The British and American group is also not showing weakness, making every effort to strengthen Singapore's defenses and jointly drafting practical and effective defense measures with Australia. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>New York - Sydney has already begun air defense work. According to the Associated Press, Sydney has dug thirteen public air raid shelters. At the same time, Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden said that in view of the increasingly serious situation in the Far East, he has decided to convene a meeting of the Premiers of the Australian states to discuss the military situation and air defense measures. (TASS dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Singapore - The British Far East Command announced today that the British Far East forces have recently added a large number of new-style bombers, twin-engine and single-engine fighters. These aircraft are now stationed in various areas of military importance. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Australian Troops Arrive in Singapore in Large Numbers to Directly Defend Against Japanese Invasion of Malaya</p>
<p>Sydney - Official sources announced this morning that an elite unit of Australian troops arrived in Singapore yesterday to strengthen defenses. It is reported that their stationing and supplies will be the responsibility of the Straits Settlements government. Well-informed sources explained that the landing of Australian troops in Singapore is a direct measure to prevent the Japanese army from invading British Malaya. It is also said that this confirms Britain's determination to prepare for any eventuality in the Far East. These newly arrived Australian troops are the second detachment Australia has sent from overseas. Other detachments are currently serving in the Middle East forces. (International News Service dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Singapore - Government officials announced that thousands of Australian troops arrived in Singapore last night. After disembarking, they boarded trains and were dispatched to various locations in Malaya to be stationed. These new soldiers came from various states in Australia and are fully equipped. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Singapore - A large number of Australian troops arrived at a Malayan port yesterday. An advance party of Australian troops, carrying mechanized equipment, unloaded in large quantities after transport ships arrived at a certain Malayan naval base. The Australian troops then landed at 4 PM. Upon the arrival of the Australian troops, Sir Thomas, the Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner of the Malay States, boarded the ship to welcome them. Accompanying Sir Thomas was Major General Bennett, the commander of the Australian troops, who had just arrived here from Singapore last month. The Australian troops landed in a very orderly manner, and the process was completed by this morning. Several dark-skinned Australian soldiers told reporters from the United Press that they "hope to get practical work here." The Australian troop transport ships were closely protected by the navy during the fourteen-day voyage. Officials said that the voyage was very safe. The fully armed Australian troops stepped from the ship into specially prepared trains that stretched continuously. The new reinforcements are now being immediately transported to various Malayan defense lines. The Australian troops will be assisted by British troops in the new defense positions until the former are familiar with the new defense areas. The new troops include infantry and various supporting units and carry the latest mountain guns and assault tanks. The Australian troops brought their mechanized transport equipment, and each infantry unit is mechanized. Admiral Layton, the British naval commander-in-chief here, said, "The safe arrival of this powerful reinforcement is very satisfactory. This is sufficient to show the power of the British army to control the navy and to garrison troops in any area that needs reinforcement. This also shows that the imperial fleet is becoming stronger and stronger, so that no part of the empire has any concerns about inadequate protection." When the Australian troops arrived, military music was played on the pier, and cheers erupted. Australians threw pennies to the soldiers entering the Strait. Dockworkers received the same treatment as they passed by. Several dozen pennies fell in front of the official reception area, where the governor and his wife were sitting. They smiled and picked up the pennies and put them in their pockets as souvenirs. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>Washington - President Roosevelt appointed financial magnate Harriman as "Special Commissioner for Defense Acceleration" in London, indicating the President's intention to formulate specific measures for the Lend-Lease Act within two weeks. Harriman, a director of the Union Pacific Railroad and an internationally renowned banker, will depart for London two weeks after the draft of the defense plan is completed.

<p>London - Japanese sources said yesterday that Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu assured British Foreign Secretary Butler on Monday that Japan has no intention of attacking British possessions and territories in the Pacific. It is reported that Shigemitsu told Butler that Japan's plans in the South Pacific are mainly economic.

<h3 id="e5">US Authorities are Discussing a Rotating Naval Plan to Support Britain on the One Hand and Restrain Japan on the Other <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Washington - According to well-informed sources here, US authorities are currently discussing a rotating naval plan to assist Britain on the one hand and prevent Japan from assisting its Axis allies on the other. According to the New York Times, the first plan under discussion is for the United States to exchange its destroyers or cruisers with Britain in place of the same number and type of British ships entering the United States for repairs. Another plan is for the United States to exchange several small warships with Britain in exchange for British warships that the US can use in the Pacific. Those discussing the above plan are currently studying the question of how the US Navy can back Britain in the Atlantic while making Japan worry. At the same time, some commentators believe that any slight change in the Far East is likely to cause a war between the United States and Japan, and it is strange that the Japanese do not understand the danger of continuing to create serious situations. Japan must know that it cannot get help from Germany. Once Japan loses its sea power, China will eliminate Japan's commercial and military power. Japan at this time can be compared to Italy a year ago. At that time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini believed that Britain would fail quickly, so he did not hesitate to make a desperate gamble. He knew that in Hitler's solution, Italy could not get anything except what it occupied during the victory. Japan's calculation is similar now. What Japan is encountering now is participation in the war, ostensibly to cooperate with Hitler, but in fact to preemptively seize a share of Hitler's victory. Mussolini determined that Hitler could win last year, which led to a big mistake and the loss of his African empire and part of his fleet. Even if Hitler wins, Italy will eventually be a defeated country and be controlled by Hitler. The danger of Japan's miscalculation is greater than that of Italy, because Hitler can help Italy nearby, but cannot help Japan from afar.</p>
<p>Japan Miscalculates US Behavior</p>
<p>American journalist Walter Lippmann recently wrote an article warning Japan that Japan is currently in danger of miscalculating American behavior. In his opinion, what is most conducive to peace is to make Tokyo clearly understand that the United States is determined to safeguard its security no matter what. Japan cannot think that the United States will always be neutral. If the Japanese think that Hitler's victory in Europe will make the United States succumb in the Caribbean Sea, then they are greatly mistaken. It should be known that since the United States is threatened by a two-ocean attack, the necessary path it should take is to defeat Japanese sea power before Hitler can attack the United States. Now American diplomats, Congress, and public opinion are working to tell Japan this position before Japan ties itself up. A well-known commentator of the American isolationist faction recently also expressed his opinion, indicating the most folding trend of the isolationist faction, saying that the rapid race of the United States has crossed the boundary that should not be crossed again. The current momentum is extremely strong, and it is uncertain whether it can stop before the boundary that is war. If Japan's threat to the United States is the same as Hitler's threat to Britain, then the common direction of defense for Britain and the United States is inevitable, that is, the British and American navies cooperate with each other in mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The New York Herald Tribune also had an editorial criticizing Japan for stirring up trouble in the Pacific and praising Singapore, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies for not being threatened, saying that Tokyo has been affected. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is now extending his empty palm and making an appeal to the civil nations, "We never want to harm anyone." May our civil nations forever make Matsuoka hold this posture. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japan Avoids War With the US <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>New York - A senior Japanese official said that Japan will do its best to avoid war with the United States, but the Japanese side also admitted that the relationship between Japan and the United States may face a serious crisis in the recent weeks. According to the Japanese side, the crisis will arise from the American intervention in the Sino-Japanese War and from the further cooperation between Britain and the United States. The United States is acting as the "protector of British interests in East Asia" and is carrying out continuous political, economic, financial, and military activities in Washington to prevent Japan from dominating the Western Pacific. It is generally believed that the US Marine Corps will remain stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Peiping for the time being, and the Asian fleet will come to China for spring exercises as usual. The main fleet will remain in Hawaii to continue resupplying. At the same time, it is believed that the Japanese naval side has gradually opposed conflict with the United States.

<h3 id="e9">The Turkish-Bulgarian Declaration <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Today's Balkans can no longer be equated with what it was twenty-five years ago. Compared to twenty-five years ago, today's Soviet Union is no longer the main protagonist in the current European war, and today's Turkey, although its territory is smaller than before, has increased its strength and has an independent and firm foreign stance. Therefore, the saying that the Balkans is the powder keg of Europe obviously has a different meaning than before. The various antagonistic relationships that exist within it are more complex and complicated than before; the potential balance of power within it has no stable foundation. Therefore, the various forces that penetrate into it cannot act arbitrarily, let alone control the situation. They are all secretly wary of each other and are generally reluctant to take rash action unless they are forced to. Even without Italy's reckless and unsuccessful attack on Greece, the formal peace and harmony of the Balkans on a powder keg may not have been able to continue to this point. This is one of the reasons why the Nazis have been slow to come to the rescue after the Italian army's disastrous defeat for nearly three months.</p>
<p>Germany's unwillingness to turn the Balkans into a battlefield has very clear reasons. However, it has always been scheming and trying to use diplomacy to win over some small countries in the area to its own camp. Romania, which has already joined, goes without saying. Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, as well as Turkey, which has mutual assistance relations with Britain, are the main targets of the German diplomatic offensive. Whether its intention is to stabilize the rear or reverse the decline, those are necessary steps before launching another offensive against Britain. At this moment, Turkey and Bulgaria suddenly jointly issued a non-aggression declaration, affirming mutual trust and friendship, which inevitably causes great stimulation to the world and arouses various different reactions.</p>
<p>Solely from the perspective of the Balkans itself, it is indeed a matter of happiness that Turkey and Bulgaria, which have always been estranged and wary of each other, can approach each other and show mutual trust in times of crisis and shock. However, what is causing major anxiety at this moment is nothing more than: (1) the existence of the Italo-Greek war, (2) Bulgaria's approach to the Nazis, and (3) the rumor that German troops are preparing to pass through Bulgarian territory to attack Greece. Although the declaration contains the explicit provision that "it does not affect the obligations of the two countries under existing treaties," it cannot alleviate the world's anxiety about the fate of Greece and Britain's strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean, and cannot help but express regret for Turkey's attitude and steps. As for the nature and consequences of this new scene, various parties have different opinions and understandings. Therefore, it is even more difficult to grasp this future trend. What is clearly understood is that today's Balkans does not have the final determining significance for the current situation in Europe, and the complexity and subtlety of the various forces within it is even greater than before. If we analyze it and explore its traces and trends, the following points are worth paying attention to: First, although news of the German military deployment in Romania and Bulgaria has been frequently reported recently, no matter what, the Nazis are ultimately not in favor of the spread and expansion of the war in Southeastern Europe. If we say that Germany is preparing to respond to the future offensive against Britain and divert British attention with military action in the Balkans, then no matter what, the German army has no way to make a fatal blow to Britain in that direction. Not only that, but its own outpost line has been lengthened, which has also dispersed its own forces and made its oil and food warehouse, Romania, vulnerable to attacks and destruction. Then, it is still questionable whether this strategy is clumsy or sharp. Second, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it had previously strongly urged Turkey to get rid of its obligations to aid Britain, and last winter it prevented Bulgaria from joining the Axis powers. All these intentions were nothing more than to prevent the Black Sea gateway and Southeastern Europe from being affected by the war. If the Soviet Union also participated in this Turkish-Bulgarian negotiation, it must have taken the same position and would never have helped the Axis powers open a passage to the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. Third, what Turkey is most concerned about should be how to reduce the threat to the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits and Istanbul. This is also the main basis for cooperation between Britain and Turkey in the Near East. Turkey's concern for Greece is also to protect itself. If German forces invade Thessaloniki, it is not difficult to imagine how shocked Turkey will be. It is also credible that the Turkish authorities would never condone and sit idly by the German expansion towards the entrance to the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea in order to win peaceful coexistence with Bulgaria. Fourth, when the Italian army invaded Greece, Turkey did not fulfill its obligation to aid Greece. In this Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression declaration, there is also no tendency to prevent Bulgaria from demanding territory from Greece. However, the solemn statement that it does not affect the obligations of treaties with third countries clearly indicates that Turkey's obligations to Greece still exist. As for how to reconcile and use the two after the declaration, it remains to be seen in the future actions of the Turkish authorities. The declaration alone is not enough to judge. And its special statement that the British-Turkish military treaty is still valid at least clearly shows that it has not taken the path of separation from Britain. Based on these four understandings, it can be seen that this move by Turkey and Bulgaria is neither a "victory for the civil nations" nor can it be hastily regarded as the Axis powers have achieved any reliable achievement. Its influence on the entire situation in the Balkans, apart from reducing the suspicion and hostility between the two countries and indirectly reducing the scope of turmoil in Southeastern Europe, it is still necessary to see the future relationship and changes in the various forces on that side to determine whether it will cause any new changes. At present, what is most worthy of attention is how Germany will act and how German-Bulgarian relations will evolve after this scene. Guessing Germany's goal regarding this action, we do not estimate it to be very high. In addition to the expansion of power, which is of course, what it urgently needs is to urge Greece and Italy to stop the war, and to prevent Britain from launching possible land offensives in Southeastern Europe in the future. In short, this forms a very noteworthy link in the entire international situation, but it is not an extremely important link. If we say that this will allow the protagonist of the Pacific crisis to seize the opportunity to stir up trouble that they have long hoped for, then the opportunity given to them will be another case of painting a cake to satisfy hunger.</p>

<p>Chongqing. Chairman Chiang declared tonight that he is confident that China will soon drive the Japanese out of China and win the final victory in this war. He also hoped that the people in the occupied areas would eradicate opium and gambling. Chairman Chiang stated, "We are confident that the Japanese army will soon be driven out, but upon our return, we must do our best to eradicate the stain of opium and gambling." On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang addressed the nation on the radio for thirty-six minutes. The speech largely pointed out the harm of opium and gambling. He said, "We have been at war for four years, with 1.7 million Japanese soldiers killed and the Japanese side's total war expenses exceeding 180 billion yen. There is no doubt that we will win the final victory in this war." Chairman Chiang then urged the people in the occupied areas to completely abstain from opium and gambling, which disgrace the nation. He stated, "Eliminating the harm of opium is as important as driving the Japanese out of China. Therefore, we should kill at the front lines and eradicate opium in the occupied areas. Japan is our external enemy, while opium and gambling are our internal enemies. Even if we can drive out the external enemy, if we still allow these two internal enemies to exist, the country will still have no way out." Chairman Chiang further urged the nation to pay attention to thrift, promote public health, and exercise. He stated that since the New Life Movement was initiated seven years ago, the four principles of the movement—propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame—have unified the nation's political thought, disciplined the military, and increased economic production. The main reason why the Japanese army cannot conquer China is the vigor of the Chinese people. To commemorate the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement, a week-long program has been set. A New Life Movement Model Area will be opened in the downtown area tomorrow, and sports meets and group weddings will be held. (18th, United Press Correspondent Wang dispatch)</p>

<p>Hungarian Capital. According to news arriving here this morning, the Greek government issued a public statement last night completely denying the news that Greece and Germany are currently conducting peace talks to resolve the Greek-Italian war. Yesterday, rumors spread that after the announcement of the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement, Germany had already begun negotiations with Greece on behalf of Italy to quickly achieve peace between Greece and Italy. Although Greece has denied it, news reaching here today still strongly asserts that Germany has taken on the role of mediator and has begun peace talks in Sofia, Bulgaria. (19th, International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin. At a press conference, a German official spokesman was asked by a foreign reporter whether Germany had taken measures to mediate the Greek-Italian war. He replied that Berlin had not heard of anything about it. (19th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia. Authoritative sources here stated yesterday that Germany has initiated "early peace" talks between Greece and Italy in Sofia, but Greece has denied this. It is understood that Germany has come forward to mediate and is using the newly signed Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact as pressure on Greece. Reliable sources expressed the opinion that the announcement of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact has placed Greece in a dilemma: to establish peace, or to be occupied before British troops arrive, or for British troops to arrive before German troops pass through Bulgarian territory, thus turning Greece into a battlefield. The Greek government has denied the rumor that Greece requested France to postpone sending troops, fearing that it would prompt swift action by German troops. (19th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens. London officials are studying with great concern reports that Greece may be forced to accept a German-proposed peace offer. British officials believe that although Greece denies that the German-proposed peace plan is being studied in Athens, it is quite possible that Greece will be forced to accept this plan. As for the signing of the Turkish-Bulgarian pact, it has caused pessimism among officials here. High-ranking officials said that no matter how the agreement is embellished, "it cannot be said that this is a victory for the democracies." Although some knowledgeable people say that this pact has no impact on Greece's position in the war, public opinion believes that the Axis powers' position in the Balkans has been strengthened as a result, while the position of the Allied powers has been weakened.

<p>Before the Turkish-Bulgarian Pact Was Signed, Britain, Turkey, and Greece Held Talks</p>
<p>Istanbul. It is reported from Turkish sources that when Turkey and Bulgaria were about to sign a non-aggression treaty, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu met with British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and Greek Ambassador Raphael for friendly and lengthy talks. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Ankara. According to political and diplomatic circles here, Turkey's signing of a non-aggression treaty with Bulgaria is an expression of its determination to maintain absolute neutrality. Turkish newspapers all published the full text of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact on their front pages. "Forum" stated that peace in the Balkans is now stable. "Evening Post" stated that this is the greatest success of Turkish diplomacy, and various rumors of the past few weeks have now vanished. (19th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Istanbul. The most well-informed neutral sources here stated today that the most important effect of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty is that when German troops enter Bulgaria, Turkey will not take preemptive measures by sending troops into Bulgaria. This confirms the recent statement by the Turkish military that Turkish troops will remain on the front lines, waiting for others to attack. (19th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Turkish Policy Follows the Soviet Union in Maintaining Peace in the Balkans</p>
<p>Vichy. After the governments of Bulgaria and Turkey signed a political agreement and issued a joint declaration yesterday, observers here commented that Turkey has signed a mutual assistance treaty with Britain and has certain obligations to Britain. However, Turkey will apparently give a narrow interpretation to these obligations in the future. In other words, only when Turkish territory is directly invaded by another country will it intervene in the current European war. Regarding this matter, when the representatives of Bulgaria and Turkey were conducting talks, they reportedly notified the Soviet Union of the situation at any time. This is because Turkey and the Soviet Union have close relations, and Turkey must seek the Soviet Union's opinion before taking any international action. This fact is perhaps the most noteworthy point of these talks. In the past, Bulgaria's desire to obtain an outlet on the Aegean Sea was opposed by Turkey. At that time, Turkey possessed unparalleled power in the Balkan Peninsula and was able to use its influence to support Greece in rejecting any demands from other countries. This was because Turkey was extremely willing to be adjacent to Greece. If Bulgaria were to demarcate a corridor in the Dedeagatch [Alexandroupoli] region to reach the Aegean Sea directly, Turkey and Greece would be separated. In the past, although Bulgaria was outwardly cautious in everything it did, no matter what kind of military action occurred in the Balkan Peninsula, Bulgaria would inevitably take advantage of the situation to secure an outlet on the Aegean Sea, thereby expanding the war to the Dardanelles Strait, which would also expand it to the important strongholds of the Soviet Union and Turkey. However, this situation is no longer the case. Even if the current European war expands to the eastern Balkan Peninsula, Bulgaria will be able to stay out of it, and the spheres of influence of the Soviet Union and Turkey will not be affected in any way. (18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia. Officials expressed full support for the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration, believing that it is trending towards peace in the Balkan Peninsula and cooperation among the Balkan peoples. South National political figures are of the opinion that the establishment of this agreement is largely due to the influence of the Soviet Union, as Soviet policy aims to maintain peace in the Balkans. It is generally believed that the only benefit Hitler can obtain from this will be the reduction of the 600,000 Turkish troops currently stationed in Thrace. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Whether Britain's Relationship with Bulgaria Continues Depends on Germany's Actions</p>
<p>Sofia. The British Minister to Bulgaria stated last night that if Bulgaria loses its neutrality due to an attack in war, then Germany must act first. Whether the British Embassy remains here at that time will depend on Germany's actions. Furthermore, the British side pointed out that the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression declaration stipulates that it does not affect the existing treaties of the two countries. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed yet what action Turkey will take if German troops cross Bulgaria to attack Greece and assist Italy. (19th, United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin. The "Hamburg Foreign News" today published an article interpreting why the Turkish-Bulgarian pact is another blow to Britain, stating that the Turkish-Bulgarian pact is a milestone after Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact. Germany's policy aims to maintain peace in the Balkan countries and prevent them from being drawn into the war. It also said that Britain's policy aims to use Turkey's geographical location as a base for attacking the Balkan countries, but this attempt has now been thwarted. Britain's dominant position in the Balkans has disappeared with the conclusion of the Turkish-Bulgarian pact. (19th, Huitong dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo. Japanese newspapers have all published commentaries on the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty, believing that this treaty is a major political event and another failure of British diplomacy.

Britain's warnings to the Balkan countries have apparently not taken effect. (19th, Huitong dispatch)</p>

<p>London. A Reuters correspondent stationed on the Albanian border reported that on Tuesday, Greek troops were still attacking on all fronts in heavy rain, but Italian troops were also constantly reinforcing. The most intense fighting that day occurred in the Këlcyrë-Tepelenë area, with the Italian 11th Army resisting at great sacrifice. According to the latest Greek communiqué, the result of the attack was the complete expulsion of the enemy troops from their strong positions, inflicting heavy losses on them. Greek troops captured one hundred enemy soldiers and countless automatic cannons and mortars. Greek aircraft bombed targets in the war zone with considerable success. All aircraft returned safely to base. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London. It is reported that the Greek offensive is becoming increasingly fierce. Greece announced its recent victory, saying that Greek troops have captured a very important Italian stronghold, 5,000 feet high, in the central area of the Albanian front, enabling them to control the area from Tepelenë to Këlcyrë. Italian troops suffered heavy losses and are currently retreating. Greek vanguards have also driven Italian troops out of several strong positions and repelled Italian counterattacks. Athenian commentators, referring to this matter, said that an Italian counterattack, a Blackshirt unit of about 1,200 men, was almost completely annihilated. Greek troops captured a large number of enemy troops, including many Blackshirts and Alpine troops. A Greek military headquarters communiqué stated that the Greek Air Force bombed and strafed targets on the battlefield with considerable success. The Greek army suffered no losses. The British Air Force assisted Greek aircraft in combat, heavily attacking Italian positions north of Tepelenë and harassing Italian troops retreating in the area around Këlcyrë with considerable success.

<p>Washington: Although the Lend-Lease Act faced fierce opposition in the Senate yesterday, President Roosevelt disregarded it. As the "Four Giants" of the non-interventionist faction exhausted all their efforts to oppose the bill, the President stated that it would be implemented immediately after passage. The non-interventionist faction believes that the Lend-Lease Act will pass in the Senate, and they have now begun to strive for amendments to curtail the President's actual dictatorial power. Three Republicans and one Democrat launched a fierce attack in the Senate yesterday. Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, stated that the bill overturns 150 years of American foreign policy and will undoubtedly lead the "United States into war." Senator Johnson, a Republican from California, supplemented the minority report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warning that the bill would make the President a dictator with the power to plunge us into war. Senator Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan, stated that the power of the bill would clearly make the White House the headquarters for deciding World War II. Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota, accused Morgan and other financial groups of promoting aid to Britain and issuing commands, devising strategies to make the American people believe that Britain is fighting for the Americans. In short, in the history of the United States Senate, this was one of the fiercest verbal battles. (International Dispatch, 19th)</p>

Plans that Canada, New Zealand, and Australia have not implemented should not be adopted in the United States, causing American taxpayers to make sacrifices, he said. Clark also stated that the opposition did not want to prolong the debate on this bill excessively and intended to conclude it within a few days. Upon hearing this, people hoped that the bill could be passed quickly in the Senate. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>New Life Movement Seventh Anniversary: President Chiang's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday): If we make a precise comparison between the past seven years, we cannot but recognize the great progress in all aspects of our country. Recalling the beginning of the New Life Movement, those who were jealous and slandering us said that it was "the result of the anti-Japanese movement" and that it was just a "re-enactment of the Chinese's five-minute enthusiasm." They were jealous of this movement, fearing that the promotion of this movement would be the foundation of our restoration movement and would give their ambitions the greatest blow. Now, those who ridicule us have proven their estimates to be wrong, and what they were jealous of and preventing has given them the most serious head-on lesson. As for the general public in the country, many were skeptical and waited to see at the time, thinking that defending against insults and protecting the country lies in strength, and that this new movement was not the top priority. Moreover, many people who have lost their national self-confidence only know</p>
<p>aiming high and pursuing novelty, forgetting our own history and the inherent spirit of the nation, thus arbitrarily criticizing us. Some said that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are too old-fashioned, and some even said that restoring these four dimensions is a kind of regressive restoration movement, taking the new life we advocate as a laughing stock and stubborn. But now, after three years of</p>
<p>factual lessons, especially in the three and a half years of combat, all of our compatriots, old and young, in the front and rear, who are not afraid of death, not afraid of chickens, and have made loyal and heroic sacrifices, which one is not a manifestation of the inherent spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame? Therefore, today, not only does no one oppose the psychology of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, but everyone confirms that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the foundation of establishing the country and saving the country.</p>
<p>In the past, our general public was spiritually depressed, ideologically confused, and psychologically cowardly. Now, vitality is increasing day by day, steps are becoming more and more orderly, and self-confidence is becoming stronger and stronger. Thus, the people who were once insulted as a "heap of loose sand," with so-called "propriety and righteousness swept away" and "integrity and shame vanished," have now gradually become united, energetic, and fighting warriors. Everyone is united under the general outline of resistance and construction,</p>
<p>fully expressing the new spirit of our nation's promotion and advancement with courage. Compatriots, just compare the situation seven years ago and now, and you will know that this unconscious progress is the most important force for our war against Japan. In these forty-four months of self-defense war, we have caused the Japanese army to suffer 1.7 million casualties and spent 18 billion in military expenses. This is not entirely due to</p>
<p>Our weapons can hit him to this point. This achievement is created by the spirit and strength of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame accepted by our military and civilians, front and rear. Speaking of this, I would like to ask our compatriots, especially the intellectuals who have leadership responsibilities, and the leaders of all walks of life in society, to thoroughly think about it. Today,</p>
<p>There is no doubt that all compatriots across the country recognize the New Life Movement as the necessary path to save the country. But have each of us made the greatest efforts to promote the New Life Movement? Have we sincerely accepted the main points and methods of the New Life Movement and been able to implement them? Have we</p>
<p>Has this movement been popularized? I ask everyone who listens to my speech today to take out and reread the two sections in the outline of the New Life Movement, "Why is a New Life Needed?" and "Why is the New Life Movement Needed?" and also check the methods of the New Life Movement in the outline. Have we done it? "From the city to the countryside, from institutions and schools to the general public</p>
<p>It is true that we have made considerable efforts in the New Life Movement. We initially advocated the cleaning movement and the rule movement, and achieved some success. Before the war, we held group training and summer rural service, etc. After the war, in the past three and a half years, we have devoted ourselves to</p>
<p>battlefield service and rear relief. We held battlefield services, held women's training, launched military service propaganda, and wounded soldier relief movements, adopted orphans, relieved the lives of refugees, promoted thrift donations, implemented air raid services, assisted in spiritual mobilization, and promoted other kinds of work related to resistance and construction. But our work</p>
<p>Actually, it is still sporadic and partial. The effectiveness of our work has not yet met the requirements of the resistance and construction cause. Just looking at our bad habits of smoking and gambling that have not been fundamentally eradicated, the social decline has not been universally eliminated, and the national spirit has not been fully revitalized, not only should the people who lead the new movement all admit that they have not fulfilled their responsibilities, but the general public should also admit</p>
<p>Not enough effort I believe that a nation must be able to revitalize itself and become strong, and must be able to defend against insults from the outside and eliminate evil from the inside. The ancients said, "It is easy to remove the thieves in the mountains, but it is difficult to remove the thieves in the heart." The thieves in the mountains and the thieves in the heart are the same, enough to hinder the progress of society and the survival of the nation. People and nations currently have external and visible enemies, as well as internal public enemies in social customs and national morality. We must overcome these changing enemies at the same time before our nation can truly be restored. (End of the 18th dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Parliamentarian Bartley suggested in the Lower House yesterday, regarding the arrest of several Chinese crew members on the Peng Shipping Company's "Peng Macduie" and "Peng Macgrew" ships, that the shipping companies should immediately pay Chinese sailors a war allowance of £5 per month. Minister of Shipping Cross replied that he had been in close contact with shipping companies employing Chinese sailors for a long time and was familiar with their treatment. Since the beginning of the war, the remuneration of Chinese sailors has increased greatly, and the increase in remuneration for those sailing on the Far East coastline is higher than £5. Although the increase in remuneration is not called a war risk allowance, it can be said to be increased due to the war situation. Cross replied to a supplementary question that the increase in economic remuneration for Chinese sailors is very large. Chinese sailors recruited in Shanghai and Hong Kong, serving on ships outside the coastal limits, received £1 18s 9d per month before the war, but now they receive from £7 14s to £9 14s. Although this increase is not called a wartime allowance, it can be said to be increased due to the war situation. Chinese sailors recruited in Singapore received £3 15s before the war, and now receive £10 16s. The increase, except for 17s 6d, is all due to the war situation. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e38">British and American Banks Adopt New Measures; Interest Suspended for All Foreign Exchange Depositors; Notice Issued, Effective Tomorrow; Cancellation of US Dollar Checks Ends Speculation; Legal Tender Sufficient for Circulation, No Need for Foreign Exchange <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The two American banks, Citibank and Chase, in this city, issued public announcements in their respective banks on the 17th of this month, deciding to cancel US dollar check accounts from March 1. There are no changes to the legal tender check accounts. According to reports, in addition to the above two American banks in this city, there are also American Express and AIG. A reporter from the Grand China News Agency visited senior officials of the two banks yesterday. It is said that the American Express Bank authorities only decided today (yesterday) to take the same measures as Citibank and Chase, and will also implement them from March 1. AIG Bank has never engaged in this business (US dollar check accounts), so there is no need to take this precautionary measure. According to the reporter's investigation, Citibank, Chase, and American Express have recently taken another step, suspending interest payments to foreign exchange depositors from tomorrow (21st). The only foreign bank to join is Mercantile Bank of India, London and China. Citibank's announcement reads, "To all depositors of savings foreign exchange, from February 21, 1941, foreign exchange savings will no longer be paid interest."</p>
<p>Aims to Eliminate US Dollar Trading</p>
<p>The American banks' cancellation of check accounts aims to eliminate the speculation of US dollars in the Shanghai market. Holders of US dollar accounts deposit US dollars, use checks, and speculate in US dollars in the market, thus creating the indiscriminate issuance of US dollar checks, resulting in busy check receipts and payments on the bank side, but in reality, it is not beneficial. However, the implementation of this new method will not affect the interests of the entire Shanghai financial and depositor community.</p>
<p>Legal Tender Depositors Not Affected</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that an employee of Citibank told a reporter from the North China Daily News yesterday that only US dollar check account holders are affected by the new measures of Citibank and Chase, and legal tender check account holders are not affected. The employee continued that most of Shanghai's commercial transactions are circulated in legal tender, so there is no need for foreign exchange accounts. The trend of opening foreign exchange accounts by banks was started by American banks. At that time, because the price of legal tender was unstable, merchants needed more reliable foreign exchange as a commercial tool. However, this need is now gradually decreasing. The purpose of the two banks taking new measures is to do with this. Savings in US dollars to the above two banks are not affected by the new measures. US dollar savings can still be made as usual. If you want to withdraw, the New York head office will issue a draft. The value of the draft in commerce is better than the credit of a privately issued check.</p>
<p>US Dollar Savings Are Also Very Convenient</p>
<p>Yesterday's English-language Financial and Commercial News reported that the announcement by American banks such as Citibank and Chase that US dollar check accounts would be cancelled from March 1 has caused groundless rumors in this city, even some saying that legal tender will also be handled in the same way, which is equivalent to stopping business. This kind of rumor can be said to be unwise. In fact, the banks have not considered this. The so-called US dollar check account is a recent occurrence. Because its use has become widespread, many rents and other commodities in this city are priced in US dollars. In this situation, US dollar check deposits are quite convenient, but they also produce unexpected consequences, because many depositors use this to engage in foreign exchange speculation, but this speculative business is about to end, because they will no longer be able to issue US dollar checks and resell them to others. All US dollar transactions and deposits can be remitted to New York for storage. If the deposit is small, it can be changed to a savings deposit, with a maximum amount of US$5,000. This small amount of US dollar savings deposits is enough to meet the needs of small commercial transactions and will not make the public feel inconvenient. If there are still people who try to speculate using small savings deposits, the bank can sever commercial relations with them. From the bank's point of view, this new method can be said to be practical and does not violate business practices. However, the comments made outside on the protection of depositors' interests in the new method and the rumors that it is related to the possibility of the United States freezing deposits are far from the truth. In short, the main impact of this move is that US dollar funds can no longer be massively circulated in the market in this city.</p>

<p>French Ambassador to China Cosme arrived in Shanghai last month from Hong Kong on the "General Pershing." Half a month has passed since then. It has been said repeatedly that Cosme will leave Shanghai and travel north at the beginning of this month, but the ambassador has delayed his trip because of official duties in Shanghai. According to reliable news obtained by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency from the French Embassy, Cosme has decided to travel north by boat this Saturday, so he can handle embassy affairs in North China and make a tour of North China. The embassy contacted the shipping company yesterday about cabin space. The ambassador's wife will also travel with him. According to embassy news, the ambassador's trip will be temporary, and he will return south at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Business Corps Reorganizes New C Company; Enhances Central District Defense; Composed of Members of Northern European Nationalities; White Russian Squad and Armored Car Squad Join <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and the Supreme Command of the International Settlement have recently decided to expand the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and reorganize the new C Company due to actual needs. It is scheduled to be established on March 9. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency from relevant parties, once the reorganized new C Company is established, its strength will be sufficient, and the security of the settlement can be ensured. The public believes that although this measure by the concession authorities is because the current number of members of the business corps is insufficient for normal defense, the tension in the Pacific situation also has a considerable impact.</p>
<p>Reorganize Defense</p>
<p>The new C Company is composed of volunteer members of countries in Northern Europe close to democratic countries, such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, etc., and the armored car squad and the C White Russian volunteer squad. Among them, although the armored car squad has not changed its name, it has actually been changed to an infantry squad and uses rifles. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander, Happer, recently reorganized the defense in the central district of the Public Concession. He has also adjusted it and issued an order yesterday to make a new regulation on the defense of the central district of the business corps.</p>
<p>Rotate on Defense</p>
<p>According to the new regulations, from the 27th of this month, the defense of the central district will be carried out by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps A Company, B Company, the new C Company, and the Light Cavalry Squad in rotation. (1) From the 27th of this month to March 2nd, it is B Company. (2) From March 2nd to March 9th, it is A Company. (3) From March 9th to March 12th, it is the new C Company. (4) From March 12th to March 14th, it is the Light Cavalry Squad. (5) From March 14th to March 17th, it is B Company. (6) From March 17th to March 24th, it is A Company. (7) From March 24th to March 27th, it is the new C Company. (8) From March 27th to March 29th, it is the Light Cavalry Squad.</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Fang Dan Case - Continued Hearing Today - Little Hope for Reconciliation - Heated Debate Expected <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The case of four Chinese landowners, Fang Jiaping, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende, suing the Shanghai Municipal Council for collecting land tax on Fang Dan land, is scheduled to continue hearing at 2:30 PM today in the Shanghai Municipal Council's meeting room on the second floor. There is little hope for reconciliation in this case, as the plaintiffs believe that according to various documents of the Shanghai Municipal Council, there is no reason to change Fang Dan land into Daoqi land and collect taxes. Therefore, it is expected that after the court hearing today, there will be a fierce debate between the plaintiffs and the defendants. According to Liu Shifang, the plaintiffs' defense lawyer, the plaintiffs' refusal to pay the Fang Dan land tax is based on two points: (1) The Yangjingbang Land Regulations do not specify that Fang Dan land must pay taxes. (2) Section 7 of Chapter 5, "Land Ownership and Land Prices," in the first volume of the report by Judge Feitang, states that within the area designated for the expansion of the concession in 1899, ... the land owned by Chinese people will not be assessed and taxed according to the Land Regulations. (Editor's note: Judge Feitang's report was a special study commissioned by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) to research various issues within the concession.) The Shanghai Municipal Council relies on this report to resolve various issues.</p>

<p>At 9:00 AM on the 16th of this month, near the Xuhui section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, two children carrying a small amount of rice attempted to crawl through the barbed wire to enter Xuhui. They were shot by Japanese sentries, resulting in the death of a girl and serious injuries to her brother. The rice they were carrying was scattered all over the ground. The girl, about twelve years old, died after being shot through the chest. Her body was taken home by her family. Her younger brother, several years younger, was shot in the knee and rushed to the Fuyi Hospital for emergency treatment by rickshaw.</p>
<p>A Hole Dug in the Barbed Wire</p>
<p>The shooting occurred on the railway line of Xujiahui Creek at the intersection of Zhongshan Road. Villagers nearby had dug a hole in the barbed wire obstacles to carry rice through and sell it in Xuhui, avoiding extortion by Japanese sentries at the entrances and exits. These children often climbed treetops to check if there were any Japanese soldiers nearby, then successively carried rice through the blockade line.</p>
<p>Children Sneak Through - Japanese Soldiers Open Fire</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, there were no Japanese soldiers visible in the vicinity. The children began to sneak through the barbed wire, unaware that Japanese soldiers were hidden in a sentry post about 150 yards away. When they saw the children crossing the barbed wire, armed Japanese soldiers and a Chinese man rushed to the scene in a vehicle. As the children panicked, the Japanese soldiers got out of the car and opened fire on them. It is unknown whether the Japanese soldiers intended only to intimidate them or if they were deliberately shooting.</p>
<p>Siblings Wounded - Rice Taken Away</p>
<p>However, the Japanese soldiers fired only one shot, hitting the siblings. The remaining children panicked, abandoned the rice, and fled. The Japanese soldiers and the Chinese man loaded as much rice as possible onto the vehicle and drove away. The rice they could not carry was scattered all over the ground. According to reporters, on February 8th, two Chinese men attempted to smuggle rice through the barbed wire and were also shot and injured. They were sent to Cihui Hospital (transliteration) for treatment and have not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Officers - Deny Shooting</p>
<p>It is reported that incidents of farmers in the western district smuggling rice and being shot have occurred frequently. At least one person is shot and hospitalized every week. Japanese sentries do not intend to kill those transporting rice, but aim at their legs. The Japanese sentry who opened fire on the morning of the 16th intended to wound the boy's leg, but the bullet passed through the boy's knee and then pierced the girl's chest. Japanese military officers this morning denied any shooting incidents in western Shanghai and claimed to be unaware of the shooting of the two Chinese children near the Zhongshan Road railway on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>Smuggling Rice - Seeking Meager Profits</p>
<p>However, according to a Japanese army officer, it has recently been reported that there is a lot of smuggling of goods into the two concessions from the Japanese-controlled area of western Shanghai, with rice being the most common. The price of rice outside the concessions is less than 80 yuan, while inside the concessions it sells for over 100 yuan. The officer admitted that Chinese people are often arrested for smuggling rice in western Shanghai, but denied that they would shoot and injure people.</p>

The Chinese government is currently trying to negotiate with the Vietnamese government to request their return. Chinese merchants in Shanghai have also repeatedly written to the Haiphong Detained Goods Registration Office, requesting the return of their goods, but have been rejected by the office, stating that it is not within their authority and that the Vietnamese government must decide whether or not to return them.</p>

(2) Public bonds are rain and dew, which have a nourishing effect that accelerates the growth of the material strength of the whole country. (3) Public bonds are fire, which has a burning effect of strengthening the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country. At the same time, it is declared that the committee members are completely based on serving the sacred mission of the country.

<p>Autobiographical articles are recognized worldwide as important historical texts of all ages and countries. They have been discovered in China since the Spring and Autumn period. In modern times, Mr. Hu Shih and others have actively promoted them, but none have achieved good results. Compared with the widespread promotion in Western countries, the difference is vast. People in Shanghai, such as Wen Lantao, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lidun, Zhang Shouyong, and Ding Fubao, in view of this, have especially advocated a modern autobiography movement to encourage young people to devote themselves to cultural undertakings and to serve as models for future generations. Those who wish to express their personal will and life experience and join the movement can directly contact the Youth Literary Association at 175 Gordon Road in this city. Also, the newly published Youth Literary Association Volume II - Issue 1 contains detailed chapters on the movement. Furthermore, for the sake of popularizing the way to maintain health, Mr. Ding Fubao is distributing the conditions for longevity. Those who wish to read them should write to the Medical Bookstore at 204 Baker Road, and they will be sent immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Labor Conscription Rampant North of Suzhou Creek - Chinese Men Vanish - Forced to Serve as Laborers for Japanese Army in Southern China <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the rumor of the Japanese army forcing Chinese men to work for them has been confirmed as of yesterday (the 18th). Reporters have learned from very reliable sources that the Japanese army has been conscripting laborers in the Yangshupu district north of Suzhou Creek for some time.</p>
<p>Labor Conscription Active - Late at Night and Early in the Morning</p>
<p>The Japanese army conscripts laborers late at night and early in the morning when it is still dark. As a result, a large number of Chinese people have been forcibly taken away. Hundreds of workers from the Shanghai Power Company, Borderun Manufacturing Plant, and other factories in the Yangshupu district have recently been granted permission by the factories to stay in the factories at night, fearing being taken away after dark. According to four Chinese men who were conscripted and managed to escape, hundreds of coolies, mostly conscripted from the railway areas of Haining, Xiashi, and Jiaxing, were busily loading supplies onto three transport ships at the Qiujiang Pier. Subsequently, these coolies were also escorted onto the ships and sailed south. Some escaped workers said that they were "arrested" in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Sudden Disappearances - No Trace</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers told the laborers that they would be sent to a certain place near Hong Kong to engage in construction work for the Japanese army. Regarding this point, it is said that Chinese workers and servants in factories in the Yangshupu, Huishan, and Hongkou districts north of Suzhou Creek are all afraid of being forcibly taken away, so they dare not travel on the streets at night, resulting in the Yangshupu area being as quiet as death at night. Yesterday morning, the Japanese army conscripted laborers again in Yangshupu, blocking cars and trucks along the way. Although a large number of Chinese people have been taken away in the Japanese-controlled area, as of yesterday, the concession authorities have only received one report. Many other conscripted Chinese people have suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>The Shi Gu Zhai antique shop at 70 Jiaotong Road was suddenly visited by eight bandits at about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 17th). Five of them stood guard inside the shop, and three broke into the store, looting all the valuable antiques and treasures in the cabinets, estimated to be worth over 200,000 yuan. Details have been reported in various newspapers. It is now known that the Central Police Department in charge of the area, considering the major robbery that occurred in broad daylight in the bustling city center to be extremely illegal, ordered Chinese and Western police officers to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Suspicious Behavior</p>
<p>Several suspects in the case have now been arrested one after another and are being held in the police station. However, the bandit leader has not yet been captured.

<p>Dai Mengyu, a 27-year-old man from Hunan, was a businessman in Shanghai. He was lodging at the home of his uncle, Dai Housheng, at 562 Albert Road. Recently, due to unemployment and economic pressure, he had been contemplating suicide. At 5:00 PM on the 16th of this month, he attempted suicide by jumping into the river at the northern end of the Beijing Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. He was rescued ashore by nearby boatmen and was unconscious. They managed to pour the water out of his stomach, and he finally regained consciousness. The police took Dai to the French Police Station and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Dai's determination to die was firm. At 8:00 PM on the 18th, taking advantage of the nurses' lack of attention, he got up and ran to the stairwell outside the ward on the third floor and jumped down to the ground, seeking a quick death. As a result, he injured his head and legs. Hospital workers discovered him, helped Dai up, and sent him back to the ward, reporting to the doctor for treatment. However, due to the concussion of his head and internal organs and the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective. He died at 8:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police station to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall. It also notified his uncle, Dai Housheng, to claim the body and prepare for burial today.</p>

<p>A large-scale organized human trafficking gang was investigated last spring by the Central Police Department of the Public Concession, which dispatched detectives to Shantou and Gulangyu to request assistance from local police stations. Seven traffickers, including the leaders Su Desan and Chen Zhangshi, were arrested, and more than 100 infants who had been sold for two or three years were rescued. Together with the perpetrators, they were transferred to Shanghai. In addition to rescuing the boys and having their families identify them, the captured criminals were transferred to the First Special Court and prosecuted for human trafficking. The defendants also admitted to trafficking more than 200 boys, but in many cases, the addresses of the buyers had moved, making it impossible to find them. After the court deliberated and concluded the case, it was proposed yesterday morning that Presiding Judge Xiao Xiepan sentence Su Desan and Chen Zhangshi to 15 years of imprisonment each for the repeated crime of jointly trafficking in men under the age of 20 for profit, and fine them 1,500 yuan each.

<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market suddenly turned around. The week-long decline had pushed it down to around 800 yuan. Today, the development of the situation is uncertain, and it is purely a matter of mutual disturbance in the market. The shorts are getting their way. However, due to the consolidation of the legal tender's position, the exchange market will not tighten again. Therefore, the rebound in gold prices is only temporary. The market opened at 6,020 yuan in the morning because it was difficult to buy at 6,000 yuan outside the market the previous day. After the opening, Gonghe, Xinyuan, remittance merchants, Hesheng and others sold, and the price retreated to 5,900 yuan. Later, upon hearing that the exchange rate had softened, sentiment turned bullish and everyone bought in. Although there were profit-taking closings in the middle, the upward momentum was quite strong, and the price was pushed out of the 6,000 yuan mark. The highest price was 6,105 yuan, and the afternoon closing was still 6,085 yuan, a rise of 135 yuan compared to the previous day. More than 20,000 taels were traded in half a day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon, and the off-market price rose to 6,120 yuan. The cash price also soared to 400 yuan higher than the forward price. Decheng sold 100 taels to Xianghe at 400 yuan higher, and Chida sold 100 taels to Defu at 420 yuan higher. Later, there were buyers willing to pay the higher price, but sellers required 410 yuan higher. For swaps (transferring from February to March), the seller was willing to offer 35 yuan. Gold jewelry also rose by 10 yuan, reaching 660 yuan. Guanyu and others remained flat.</p>
<p>The spot price also rebounded by 135 yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, because the market sentiment outside the market was quite strong yesterday, it was said that it was difficult to buy at 6,000 yuan, so the market opened at 6,021 yuan. However, Gonghe, Xinyuan, Hesheng and others took the lead in selling, and the price was pushed back below 6,000 yuan, and even dropped to 5,900 yuan. Because the exchange rate softened and the bearish atmosphere was weaker, Yiyuan, Hesheng, Chengji, Rencheng Yong, Tongkang Yong and others successively bought in, so the trend went upward and broke through the 6,000 yuan mark, reaching 6,005 yuan. However, ordinary retail investors and Yiyuan sold in reverse, and the price fell again, reaching 5,950 yuan. However, the buyers were not discouraged, and Chengji, Hesheng, Gongda, Defu, and Xinfeng Yongfu bought in again, and the price was raised to 6,105 yuan. Before the closing, the price fluctuated, and the price fell to 6,070 yuan due to Rencheng Yong's strong selling. As a result, Chengda absorbed the selling, and the closing price was 6,085 yuan, 135 yuan higher than the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon, and the last heard price outside the market was around 6,100 yuan, with a fluctuation of 205 yuan in half a day.

The current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold also rises by 10 yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael was raised by 10 yuan, with Dahangtong quoting 660 yuan, and Xinhangtong's price being similar to the above price, with the buying price 40 yuan lower, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Food: Steady Supply of Contracted and Arriving Rice, Market Prices Suddenly Loosen from Firm and High <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Since the high price of foreign rice reached its limit, and it continued to rise without any sign of stopping, and then softened slightly, yesterday the market turned from being tight first to weakening later. At the opening of the morning market, because most of the wholesale merchants were holding on, with few selling, the market sentiment became firm again. Not only were retail sales in local shops quite smooth, but also the transaction intentions of floating speculators were also very volatile. At that time, with more buying than selling, the situation became tight again, and the asking price for general mid-market goods was once raised by one yuan. After that, buying and selling gradually became balanced, and the market gradually fluctuated. Floating profit-takers took the opportunity to cash out, and retail sales also slowed down, and the market turned from tight to weak, and various prices fell back to the original level. Therefore, the resulting closing market remained stable. However, small rice mills in Pudong, with the most goods in the market, had poor sales and fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. No. 1 New Saigon remained at 85 yuan, 84.5 yuan; No. 2 at 80 yuan, 79 yuan; No. 1 Siam at 85 yuan to 83.5 yuan; Pudong mill at 82.5 yuan, medium at 82 yuan; fire milled at 84 yuan, 83.5 yuan; second grade at 82.5 yuan to 81.5 yuan; Mendan at 86 yuan; Rangoon pointed at 83.5 yuan, 83 yuan; small rice mill at 76 yuan; Dongzhan at 75.5 yuan, 75.2 yuan; Milo at 73 yuan, second grade at 71.5 yuan; broken pointed at 67 yuan, and even down to 63.5 yuan. Many foreign firms have been in contact about contracted goods, and as soon as the shipping schedule, water freight, and war risk insurance are agreed upon, they will be shipped in succession. Moreover, foreign rice stored in Hong Kong has been urged to be shipped by telegram. At present, there are as many as 1 million to 1.3 million bags stored in Shanghai, and goods are arriving in a steady stream, with 30,000 to 50,000 bags and 10,000 to 20,000 bags arriving every day without interruption. If a large number of new transactions are concluded, it will inevitably affect the entire market, and futures trading will immediately see a drop in supply and prices. The transaction volume has decreased to 700 tons, with No. 1 Saigon in February at 96.7 yuan to 95.8 yuan, No. 2 spot at 93.5 yuan, and broken rice in February at 78 yuan, several corners to one yuan lower than the previous day. Spot transactions are also less than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. The French company's ship Ross arrived yesterday morning directly from Saigon with more than 8,000 bags and berthed at buoys 25 and 26 for unloading and transshipment to warehouses. It is said that a large batch will arrive in Shanghai today. A certain Japanese ship of the Yamashita Steamship Company, loaded with more than 50,000 bags from Saigon, is expected to arrive today as well. (Zhu)</p>
<p>Due to continuous rain, the source of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice was blocked, and it was also affected by foreign rice, and the price suddenly rose by 4-5 yuan. Yesterday, it suddenly plummeted, because most cargo owners saw that the rain had stopped, and it was difficult to delay the obstructed cargo any longer, so they all transported it in the rain. For a time, the arrival volume surged, and some of it was soaked in the rain, so they were eager to dispose of it. Therefore, sales suddenly loosened. However, the buyers initially sought to grab the scarce goods, but now they are cautiously watching, and they are also worried about the water stains, which has led to a decrease in their appetite. Therefore, the cargo owners had no choice but to offer lower prices to attract buyers. Since the rising momentum was strong, the falling trend is also strong now. As a result, whether it is thick or thin japonica rice, the price has fallen by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of Kunyuan white japonica rice is 107-108 yuan per dan, and Hujian is 104 yuan to 102 yuan. The price of Qingjiao thin rice is 100 yuan per dan, and the second grade is 99 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the constraints of other goods, the sales of glutinous rice have also loosened. The market goods are not much, so it can still be maintained without much change, only slightly soft. The price of Hong Kong special grade is 83 yuan, ordinary grade is 81.2 yuan, and glutinous rice is 75 yuan to 75 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Flour Market Slightly Declines <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The spot market for flour yesterday saw a slight weakening. Since the market had been driven up by the international situation in recent days, speculators and hoarders had bought up everything they could, fearing that overseas supplies would be cut off. But in reality, foreign flour is arriving in a steady stream. In addition to the newly arrived 38,000 bags of Canadian flour, a large batch of contracted flour is expected to arrive at the end of the month and the beginning of next month. Moreover, the atmosphere between Japan and the United States has eased somewhat, and rice prices have also softened. Therefore, the tense situation has gradually disappeared, hoarders are slightly selling, and retail sales are decreasing accordingly. Zhonglou brand Australian flour once rose to 24.95 yuan, but yesterday it has fallen back to 24.85 to 24.9 yuan. The forward market is even softer. The price of newly arrived Jinlong brand Canadian flour opened at 23 yuan and has not changed. A total of 4,500 to 4,600 bags of foreign flour were traded. Because of insufficient raw materials, the local Chinese flour mill once stopped supplying. In order to take care of the food needs of the citizens, the authorities have found a way to use foreign flour to supplement the supply. Therefore, the daily needs of this street will not be lacking, and the market will be stable.</p>
<p>Wheat: The supply of stored and incoming wheat is both scarce. Amidst the high prices in the inland producing areas and the delayed arrival of foreign wheat, cargo owners are unilaterally raising prices. However, the mills are not eagerly demanding supply, and the gate price of the Japanese mills is no longer being eased. Therefore, the market is still in a stalemate.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Yarn and Cotton: Covering Shorts Turns to Longs, Cotton Yarn Rebounds <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market turned stable, and signs of rising prices appeared. This was due to the fact that in recent days, the market had been hit by rumors, causing speculators to be active, going in and out suddenly, creating a climate of fear. Now the environment has improved, and bulls have come back to activity, and shorts are covering, so the market has rebounded and risen. However, the actual demand is less than the day before. The highest price for 20s Shuangma was 1,275 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,228 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was 1,272 yuan, falling to 1,258 yuan, and then the price was 1,282 yuan, and the final price was 1,278 yuan. Today, 285 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, and 100 pieces were shipped to Little Luzon.</p>
<p>The morning opening of Shuangma was because the price had turned up in the afternoon of the previous day, and the market sentiment continued to rise. The buying sentiment in the market was strong, and the covering of shorts was urgent. The first lot price was 1,235 yuan, slightly falling to 1,232 yuan. At this time, new buyers poured in, and the market gradually rose, reaching 1,248 yuan. Profit-takers sold, and it fell back to 1,232 yuan, fluctuating between 40-50 yuan for a long time. Then the market sentiment was good, the exchange rate narrowed, the gold price rebounded, and the market continued to improve, gradually rising to 1,273 yuan at the closing. The statistics of the amount bought by each gang during the half day are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 175, Ningbo 10, Fellow Traders 6,600, Total 6,795</p>
<h3 id="e74">Cotton is Difficult to Improve <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still lackluster. However, the rebound in the yarn market has made the market sentiment slightly stronger, but transactions are still few and there are no signs of development.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is quiet and firm. Due to buying by fellow traders and good cotton cloth trade, market prices have risen further. As a result, closing prices are 5 to 12 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose first due to purchases by European exporters, then fell back due to sales by speculators, but finally became firm again due to the easing of tensions in Europe and the Far East. Yesterday, including forecasts, prices rose by 3 rupees.</p>
<p>Transactions in Shanghai foreign cotton remain quiet. In this unpredictable current yarn market, it is unlikely that there will be a turnaround in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The market for mill-made cloth rose sharply after falling yesterday, and the market sentiment turned bullish. The selling prices of various cloths increased steadily. Fugui fine cloth rose from 36.5 yuan to 39 yuan, and Fugui twill rose to 33 yuan. As a result, the price of fine cloth and twill of various brands rose by 1.5 to 2.5 yuan per piece, the price of coarse cloth rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan per piece, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 0.5 yuan. Retail transactions on this street increased slightly, with a total of more than 400 pieces of various cloths being traded. Due to transportation difficulties, the purchase of goods by customer gangs was weak. Only Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs bought nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and other goods. 285 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Little Luzon on the 20th, and 181 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Yesterday, East Cloth rose sharply as the yarn market rebounded. The Longtou label cloth (at the trading floor) had its price limit down the day before, but today it had its price limit up. The speculation and manipulation of speculators is truly alarming. The spot market opened with Longtou fine cloth at 40.025 yuan, and immediately fell to 38.89 yuan. Then, as the prices of yarn and cloth in the exchange rose, it gradually rose to 42.7 yuan at the closing. The after-market price was once raised to 43.7 yuan. General scalpers sold and made profits, returning to 43.25 yuan. The price of 4 Gentlemen was 1.215 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Securities: Bond Market Buying Resumes <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday continued to rise. The sentiment of various gangs was relatively firm, and the short side gradually failed. Although there are still many changes ahead, this rebound after the major fall has almost recovered. The major reason is still the selling of foreign exchange, which has made funds more abundant. Moreover, the spot goods in the market suddenly became scarce, which has made the long side dominant in public bonds. The difference between the high and low prices in the market has also decreased. The market in the morning was smaller than the day before, and the price rose to more than 5 yuan in the afternoon. Xinfu's buying sentiment was still strong, and Hongda and Xinchang had some covering. Runde, Defu, and Hu Heji also bought in. Xinhua on the 16th had already sold. Lianhe, Lianyi, Jiufu and others cut off many positions. The market price fluctuated, and as a result, it continued to rise by 0.65 to 1.1 yuan, with a transaction volume of approximately 2.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 300 shares of Yeping stock were traded, with a price of 4.8 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Tuesday) - The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British companies in the Far East remained flat today. Only HSBC's London-registered shares rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 72 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Pading Oak Company, managed by Xiangmao Foreign Firm, will pay an interim dividend of 0.15 yuan per share on the 27th of this month for the one-year period ending at the end of April 1941.</p>

<p>The soybean market has not changed due to the insane situation of soybean cake. The source of arrivals is continuous, and the current stock is no less than 80,000 to 90,000 bags. As for sales, only the timber street export is suitable for handling. The sales markets of oil mills are mostly directly transported by Japanese merchants, so the overall development is weak and it is often in a state of flatness and fatigue. Yesterday's market was still the same. About 500 bags of Qingdao soybeans were purchased by the Hong Kong gang at a price of 38.5 yuan. About 700 bags of Tianjin soybeans were purchased by the Hong Kong gang at a price of 40.05 yuan. The rest of the traders in the market inquired about 600 bags of Guidetu soybeans at a price of 37.5 to 37 yuan, 100 bags of Wuhu soybeans at a price of 37.1 yuan, and 200 bags of Tianjin green beans at a price of 35.8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Sugar Market: Coarse White Turns Down <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market sentiment was downward, with more sellers and a declining trend. The association's prices for spot coarse white were 82 yuan to 82.5 yuan for the warehouse, and 81.7 to 81.95 yuan for outside warehouses, a difference of 1.15 yuan. For shipment on the 10th of next month and at the end of this month, the price was 81 yuan, 81 yuan, 80.08 yuan. For Taikoo Car White B Mark at the west warehouse, the price was 81.5 to 81 yuan, and for the east warehouse, the price was 81 to 81.05 yuan, a difference of 1.1 yuan. For DY Mark at the west warehouse, the price was 80.7 to 79.5 yuan, and for HX Mark at the west warehouse, the price was 80.2 to 79.3 yuan, a difference of 0.9 yuan. For Dutch red spot, the price was 62.8 to 62.5 yuan, 0.5 yuan lower than the previous day (17th). For this mill's No. 1 crystal, the price was 103 yuan, and for crystal ice, the price was 104 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the daylily market has been sluggish because the sales of various gangs are weak and the red disk price is too high, and the prices have dropped by about 5 yuan. Yesterday, the top grade daylily was sold at 155 yuan to 150 yuan, and the next grade was 140 yuan to 130 yuan. However, the producing price is still too expensive.</p>

<p>The price of arrowroot flour has been rising repeatedly because the source is feared to be blocked and the hoarders are active. Yesterday, Feiqilin mark reached 125 yuan, KG mark reached 120 yuan, ShuangT mark reached 80 yuan, and both large and small granular sago reached 90 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Both Black and White Pepper are Tight <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The market for pepper is also very firm for the above reasons. Yesterday, the price of white pepper from Wendao was 240 yuan, and the price of Dutch pepper was lower. The price of black large pepper was 125 yuan, and the price of No. 1 pepper was 127 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Coal: Abundant Arrival of Hongji Coal Ash, Prices Still Difficult to Fall <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Hongji white coal ash is the only raw material for coal balls. Although there is no lack of sources of arrival recently, and another 6,500 tons arrived by a certain ship yesterday, queuing up for cars at the wharf, the water freight is extremely high, still requiring 6.5 US dollars, customs duties and other fees, so the price is difficult to fall. According to the industry, the price of No. 2 ash is 168 yuan per ton, and the old orders are gradually being exhausted. The difference between the official and black market prices is almost the same.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Recent Developments in Education Facilities in Guizhou Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>(Guiyang Correspondence) The following is an abstract of the current status of education facilities under the Guizhou Provincial Department of Education:</p>
<p>(1) Preparing for National Education</p>
<p>Since receiving the "Outline for the Implementation of National Education" and other decrees from the Ministry of Education in May of last year, the Guizhou Department of Education formulated key points for the first year of implementing national education in Guizhou Province. Subsequently, it received a telegram from the Ministry of Education in September of last year, stating that, by order of the Executive Yuan, national education would be temporarily postponed. However, it was still permissible to proceed on a reduced scale based on the circumstances. After receiving this telegram, the Department of Education considered the implementation of national education as urgently needed in the province. On one hand, it requested the provincial government to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education, requesting that the previously approved funds be allocated as before to facilitate progress. On the other hand, it believed that national education should be implemented in conjunction with the new county system and should not be delayed. Fearing delays while waiting for a reply, it drafted "Provisional Measures for Implementing National Education in One County in Guizhou" and "Key Points for Implementing National Education in Twelve Counties, Including Guiyang, in Guizhou Province in the 30th Year of the Republic of China," along with a school establishment plan and budget allocation table, and submitted them to the provincial government for review. According to the newly revised plan, each township (town) in the twelve counties implementing the new county system in the first phase should establish a central school, and each three to five bao (neighborhood units) should establish a national school. Other counties may consider piloting the program earlier based on manpower and the actual situation in each county, to establish a foundation for national education and prepare for the promotion of the new county administration. The expenses for school establishment and teacher training are lower than those in the previous plan.</p>
<p>(2) Preparing to Establish Affiliated Elementary Schools for Normal Schools</p>
<p>There are seven provincial normal schools in Guizhou Province: Guiyang Men's and Women's Normal School, and Zhenyuan, Duyun, Zunyi, Panxian, and Bijie Normal Schools. Except for the affiliated elementary schools of Guiyang Men's and Women's Normal Schools, the affiliated elementary schools of other county schools are still lacking. In order to enable each provincial normal school to establish its own affiliated elementary school for the purpose of student teaching, research, experimentation, and guidance of local education, the Department of Education, in addition to striving to enrich and improve the affiliated elementary schools of Guiyang Men's and Women's Normal Schools, also formulated "Measures for Reorganizing Guizhou Provincial Elementary Schools into Affiliated Elementary Schools of Normal Schools." Starting from the next year (30th year of the Republic of China), the provincial Luowan, Shujiazhai, Qingshanpo, and Gaopo Zhen elementary schools near the provincial capital will be reorganized into affiliated elementary schools of Zhenyuan and other normal schools. The original elementary schools will be handed over to the Guiyang County government for unified management.</p>
<p>(3) Conducting a Province-Wide General Registration of Elementary School Teachers</p>
<p>After receiving the "Outline of General Registration Measures for Elementary School Teachers in Various Provinces (Cities)" from the Ministry of Education in May of this year and being instructed to comply and report, the Department of Education immediately formulated "Implementation Rules for the General Registration of Elementary School Teachers in Guizhou Province" in accordance with the outline and the actual situation of the counties in the province, and issued them to the counties and schools for compliance. Subsequently, in order to enable personnel in various counties who aspire to serve in elementary education to register and reserve more teachers to facilitate the promotion of national education, the previously formulated implementation rules were revised. In addition to issuing two types of registration certificates, A and B, as required by the Ministry, incumbent or non-incumbent elementary school teachers who have sufficient academic qualifications and years of teaching experience may be temporarily registered as assistant substitute teachers and issued a type C registration certificate. Currently, thirty-seven counties, including Guiyang, have complied and reported, with a total of 2,559 registered personnel. The remaining counties are also rushing to complete the process.</p>
<p>(4) Subsidizing Equipment for Provincial and County-Level People's Education Centers</p>
<p>The equipment of people's education centers at the provincial and county levels in Guizhou Province urgently needs to be improved. The Department of Education previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for subsidies for equipment expenses. The Ministry ordered that subsidies be given first to the centers managed by personnel dispatched by the province to participate in the "Training Class for Directors of People's Education Centers in Various Provinces and Cities" who have passed the training. A total of 1,000 yuan was subsidized for the equipment expenses of the Provincial Guiyang People's Education Center, and 500 yuan was subsidized for each of the thirty-two centers, including the Provincial Zunyi People's Education Center and the Longli County People's Education Center, totaling 17,000 yuan. The Department of Education followed the Ministry's regulations and, considering the province's financial resources, drafted the "Guizhou Provincial Government's Measures for Subsidizing Provincial and County-Level People's Education Centers in the 29th Year," mirroring the Ministry's subsidy amounts. The provincial center's expenses are fully borne by the province, while the county centers' expenses are shared equally by the province and the county. A total of 10,000 yuan is needed for provincial subsidies. This has been approved by the 674th meeting of the Guizhou Provincial Government Committee, and the county governments have been ordered to comply with the prescribed amounts and levels of subsidies, and the people's education centers have been ordered to prepare detailed equipment budgets and submit them for approval.</p>
<p>(5) Convening a Supervision Conference</p>
<p>In order to increase the efficiency of supervision and assist normal schools in guiding local education, the Department of Education revised the original "Regulations for the Appointment and Service of Supervisors." Regarding the division of supervision areas, the normal school districts designated by the province were used as the basis, dividing them into six supervision areas. A total of twenty supervisors were appointed, allocated based on the size of the supervision area and the level of educational development in the area. One of the supervisors in each district was designated as the chief supervisor, responsible for convening supervision meetings in the district and overseeing and directing all educational matters in the counties. The Department of Education recently convened a supervision conference on October 28th and 29th of last year to understand the details of the work of each supervisor and to allow them to exchange and communicate work experience. On the morning of the 28th, in addition to holding an opening ceremony chaired by Director Ou, each supervisor presented a work report, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Extinguishing of a Flame <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Cui Jingtai</p>
<p>My friend, Shu, who was only nineteen years old, unfortunately contracted acute pneumonia last spring, and medical treatment was ineffective. His vibrant life was abruptly destroyed. Not long before his death, he wrote to me, "Watching the flame of life gradually weaken, I am increasingly attached to this lovely life. How eagerly I long for someone to come and immediately rescue me from the threat of death! ..." I silently recited his painful heartfelt cry, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. Tears dripped down, blurring these poignant words.</p>
<p>When Shu was dying, his mind was as clear as that of an ordinary person. When he saw me coming, he even managed a smile and nodded to greet me. I walked to his bedside, and he told me to sit farther away from him. I advised him to lie quietly and not to bother speaking too much. He refused, saying, "My time is limited. It truly brings me indescribable joy to be able to talk to you for a few more moments." It seemed his life during his illness must have been too bitter and lonely.</p>
<p>"Before, I was very worried about having no hope of survival, and I was afraid of dying because it was just when I was striving to achieve something. Also, there's my mother, who depends on me for survival. Without me, how desolate will her life be!" Shu's voice was extremely weak in his labored breathing, but he still continued intermittently, "In the past two days, I've realized that all these worries of mine were just self-inflicted. So now I'm very calm..."</p>
<p>"Yes, life is inherently too ephemeral. Birth, old age, sickness, and death, aren't they all just dreams?" I originally wanted to advise him to be more philosophical, but he replied, "No, you're wrong. Life is always precious. If I could regain my strength, then I would definitely work doubly hard to live upward, and I wouldn't dare waste any more time. Don't let life down. You are still very strong, I hope you will strive hard..." Although Shu's words were weak, they were filled with intense sincerity, shaking my soul.</p>
<p>"Really, don't forget, strive hard when you are strong! Once a person falls ill, they will lose all freedom and happiness." Shu was quiet for a moment, then said with great effort, "Wait for me, wait for me, let me rest for a while and then I'll talk to you, okay?" The expression on his face when he said this was even more pitiable. Shu's mother was on the side, simply crying her heart out in pain, and I couldn't help but sob as well. Shu weakly shook his head, indicating that we didn't need to be sad for him. He then closed his eyes, as if he had fallen asleep again from exhaustion.</p>
<p>I wanted to wait for him to wake up and say some words to make him happy. However, he had quietly left this world. What bid farewell to him were also the biographies of several world-famous figures at his bedside.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Continuing "Inspiring Poems" <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Ne</p>
<p>After reading Lan Yu Jun's "Inspiring Poems," I was very moved, because I am exactly the kind of person who needs inspiration. But I also feel very sorry for Lan Yu Jun, because after he was admitted to a university "famous for its exams," and began to fight for grades all day long, why didn't he recite this poem a few more times, but instead hid it away, resulting in the misfortune of failing three subjects at graduation? So I think that if you have encouragement, but you don't use it well, it is still useless. Because of this, I also boldly wrote "half" a "poem" as a continuation of the original poem:</p>
<p>Suppose (Continued)</p>
<p>Suppose your struggle cannot be victorious,</p>
<p>My warrior,</p>
<p>You only cry, can you defeat your strong enemy?</p>
<p>Is this a little more practical?</p>
<p>Train yourself with perseverance,</p>
<p>Don't tremble like a coward,</p>
<p>Pick up your weapon.</p>
<p>Suppose you get encouragement,</p>
<p>But you hide it away,</p>
<p>Do you think it will give you courage,</p>
<p>So you can get the final victory?</p>
<p>Is this an effective method?</p>
<p>Snow Shadow Smoke Sail Works</p>
<p>My warrior,</p>
<p>Go forward,</p>
<p>Constantly inspire yourself!</p>
<p>(But Reward)</p>

<p>Xiangqi, filled with a bellyful of questions, paced back and forth in her room for a long time. It wasn't until the mute maid came to ask her to go inside again that she could figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>The strangest thing was that a very rare glow had suddenly appeared on her mother's face, and she seemed very happy. But her father, sitting at a square table, looked very awkward and hesitant. What exactly was going on? Xiangqi really couldn't figure it out!</p>
<p>"Just now Principal Hou came to me and I also met Director Ma of the Education Department..." Her father began to say to her.</p>
<p>"Director Ma...?" Xiangqi felt even stranger. To introduce a female normal school student for a position, she thought there was no need to alarm the Director of the Education Department. What exactly was going on?</p>
<p>"That's right, it's Director Ma." Her father continued, "But they're not looking for a position for you. They want to be a matchmaker for you."</p>
<p>Xiangqi's heart began to beat faster, and the smile on her mother's face became even more obvious.</p>
<p>"The man's family is Yuan Doufan, the garrison commander of Rehe. There's no doubt about his position, of course, but he's a bit older than you, or perhaps...". Her father felt very difficult. "Perhaps you won't like it?"</p>
<p>"..." Xiangqi blushed and didn't answer.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if he's a little older, as long as he hasn't been married before." Her mother, lying on the bed, interjected.</p>
<p>"I've asked about this several times, and they've all assured me." The honest father said without any doubt, "And Principal Hou knows my family situation very well, so he explained to me on the spot that he would soon find a position for me in the Education Department. After Qier officially gets married, her son-in-law promised to find another mansion in Tianjin for everyone to live together. It seems like everything is good, only the son-in-law is a bit older, inevitably making you feel wronged."</p>
<p>"Qier, as long as you agree, they will perform the betrothal ceremony this month." Her mother's heart seemed already quite anxious.</p>
<p>"I... am..." Xiangqi blushed and really couldn't say anything. (35)</p>

<h3 id="e95">Black and White and Warm Sensation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Lan</p>
<p>In the past, it was generally believed that white could prevent light from entering, and black could absorb a large amount of light. This was a fixed theorem. However, now, due to recent research by scholars, this theorem is not necessarily true. Black does not necessarily absorb a large amount of light and heat. Conversely, it is not a fact that white has a strong property of reflecting light. Black that cannot absorb light absorbs the same amount of light as white.</p>
<p>Ken Li Fu (P.W. Cumliffe), President of the British Wool Industry Research Association, recently published his opinion that black clothes are not necessarily warmer. Black clothes dyed with a certain dye reflect heat almost the same as white clothes. White clothes (such as khaki canvas) used in summer can also be worn in winter.</p>
<p>This opinion was measured by infrared photography. This can be used to measure the heat sensation of various tones, the thermal effect of various tones, and the amount of heat line absorption rate of various tones, that is, the degree of heat retention.</p>
<p>Therefore, black does not necessarily absorb and retain a large amount of thermal light (such as the sun), and conversely, white necessarily reflects but does not absorb thermal light.</p>

<h3 id="e96">After Unemployment <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Jieren</p>
<p>In October of last year, the company I worked for reduced its scope, and I was laid off and became unemployed.</p>
<p>Unemployment made me suffer from hunger and cold, and made me suffer from people's cold looks, but I was never afraid, and I was never in a hurry, just like the moment I received the news of unemployment.</p>
<p>I tightened my life, changing from three meals a day to two meals, and using my two feet instead of transportation when I went out. The housing changed from a utility room to an attic. I sold some of the clothes I wore in public and put on my father's old padded jacket. In this way, my clothing, food, housing, and transportation are completely different from before, but life is still the same stable.</p>
<p>I took half of the three months' living expenses given to me by the company and bought some magazines, monthlies, and other books, set up a book stall by the side of a noodle shop at the street corner, and earned some income every day to supplement my life. I used the other half of the money as tuition for night school, because I felt that there was nothing more urgent than this. My knowledge is not enough, now that I have free time, I will never let go of the opportunity to go to school!</p>
<p>This kind of life is very pleasant. Although I don't have any material enjoyment at ordinary times, and although my status in people's minds is low, my spirit is happy. What is the use of those boring pleasures, those false scenes? What is there to miss after abandoning them?</p>
<p>Of course, I don't want to live like this for a long time. I am training, I am learning, I am waiting for a better opportunity, I have hope and a future!</p>

<h3 id="e97">Concerning Hong Shen's Suicide Attempt: Profound Mental Distress Leading to Derangement; Scheduled to Assume Teaching Position at Zhongda University in Guangdong <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The news of the renowned playwright Hong Shen and his family's suicide attempt in Chongqing on the morning of the 5th of this month reached here only the following day via telegram. Now, we have received letters from friends in Chongqing and contributions from Guangdong, both reporting the details of Hong Shen's suicide attempt. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Although Hong Shen held positions at the Cultural Work Committee and also served as a member of the Literary Award and Grant Management Committee, he remained frustrated and unfulfilled. Since last winter, friends had already sensed that Hong Shen was somewhat abnormal, his nerves seemingly deeply affected.</p>
<p>What caused Hong Shen the most pain was the illness of his beloved daughter, Miss Hong Ling. Miss Hong Ling had been suffering from lung disease, which had now reached its third stage and was extremely serious. Medical expenses were very high, and Hong Shen had borrowed 2,000 yuan for his daughter's treatment. He had also borrowed 1,000 yuan from the Literary Award and Grant Management Committee, but later, due to some criticism from a few members, the committee decided that members were not allowed to borrow. Hong Shen, as a member, was the first to return the 1,000 yuan. To increase his income, Hong Shen recently accepted an invitation from the Literature Department of Zhongshan University, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan and an advance of six months' salary, planning to go to take up the position in March.</p>
<p>In the past two months, Hong Shen had planned to write more articles to repay his debts, but his mood was exceptionally bad, and he often could not write a single word. Five or six days before the suicide attempt, he told a friend:</p>
<p>"I can only aimlessly play with smoking and drinking now," and also said: "I simply cannot write a single word." Madam Chang Qingzhen, Hong's wife, was also enthusiastic about the drama movement. For the sake of participating in performances in eastern Hubei and northern Guangdong, she did not hesitate to send her own children to the Hong Kong Children's Welfare Institute. Before the suicide attempt, her mood was no less distressed than Hong's.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th of this month, Hong and his wife decided to commit suicide. Hong took a large dose of quinine pills, while Madam Hong drank two bottles of red potion. They left behind a suicide note, stating, "There is no way to cope with anything, it is better to go, and I cannot manage so much anymore," and similar sentiments.</p>
<p>After Hong and his wife took the poison, Miss Hong Ling discovered it and immediately asked someone to call Guo Moruo. Guo then went to Hong's residence in Santangyuan, Laijiaqiao, accompanied by a doctor. By the time they arrived, Hong and his wife were already unconscious. Emergency treatment was immediately administered. Fortunately, they were discovered early, and after injections, the poison was expelled. The danger period for Hong and his wife had passed, and they would recover after a short rest. However, Hong's hearing was slightly impaired.</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, after receiving the news of Hong's suicide attempt, the Cultural Work Committee held a meeting, which was also attended by Minister Zhang of the Political Department. They immediately granted Hong 1,000 yuan for medical expenses and decided to hire Hong as a design committee member of the Political Department, with a monthly salary of about 200 yuan. Zhang also stated that he would formulate concrete measures to ensure the future livelihood of cultural figures and writers. However, Hong instructed a friend to write a letter of refusal for Minister Zhang's donation, returning it all, and stated that all donations from friends were declined, saying that he was "by nature aloof and unyielding, otherwise he would not have ended up like this today."</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, Hong's close friends Tian Han, Ling He, and others successively went to Dun jiaqiao to visit him.</p>
<p>The latest news is that Hong Shen expressed that after recovering, he would leave Chongqing for Guangdong to take up the position of Director of the Literature Department at Zhongshan University.</p>

<p>"A Hundred-Battled Hero" is a Technicolor epic produced with all the resources of MGM. Its story is very grand and magnificent, chronicling the adventures of Rogers and his men in opening up the Northwest Passage. There are blood debts, massacres, and arson, fully exposing the most dangerous experiences of human life on the colorful film. When these unsung heroes set out, Rogers had strict selection criteria in advance, requiring sound physique and transcendent spirit. Each subordinate, bearing the heart of certain death, endured hunger and cold, feasting on rain and bathing in the wind, taking mission above life as their creed. The photo above shows Spencer Tracy playing Rogers, giving a lecture to his subordinates, the moment of vowing to set out.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Shanghai Opera School's "Marrying Off the Sister" <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>"Marrying Off the Sister" is a famous Kunqu opera, extremely demanding in terms of body movements and singing skills. It was often performed by veteran actors such as Qian Jinfu and Hou Yilong more than a decade ago. Nowadays, the veteran actors of Kunqu and Yiyang opera troupes have passed away, and there is a lack of talented Jing roles in Peking opera troupes. Although Hao Shouchang and Chen Furui can both perform "Marrying Off the Sister" and "Sanmen" (Mountain Gate), one has retired from the stage, and the other has become a vassal in the Wanshou Troupe, with even fewer opportunities to perform the full opera. Liang Lianchu, a teacher at the Shanghai Opera School, not only has a classmate friendship with Furui, but also knows that the play "Marrying Off the Sister" is Chen's masterpiece (Furui is the grandson of Chen Shoufeng, a famous Kunqu artist. His father, Jialiang, once served as Mei Lanfang's flute teacher. When Furui was training, he learned "Marrying Off the Sister" from Mr. Ye Fuhai, and coupled with his Kunqu family background, his enunciation is very accurate and powerful.) Therefore, he repeatedly pleaded with Chen to teach the plays "Marrying Off the Sister" and "Sanmen" to the opera school students Wang Zhengkun and Zhang Zhengpeng. "Marrying Off the Sister" has been performed several times with good results. The body movements such as fire-spitting and horse-riding (although riding a donkey, the movements are the same as riding a horse) are particularly worth watching. The performances of various skills by the ghosts after entering, such as stacking lions, elephants, and swimming dragons, are also very impressive.</p>

<p>Mr. Shi Renwang, the composer of song scores in this newspaper, recently opened a New Year harmonica class at the Dazhong Harmonica Association in Jiuxingli, east of Chengdu Road, Baike Road, in response to the needs of various circles. In addition to the existing research class, harmonica team, and accordion class, which continue to operate as usual, a beginner class on Sunday mornings, a beginner class on Monday evenings, and an advanced night class on Thursdays have been added, all personally taught by Mr. Shi. The classes will begin successively starting this Sunday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liangyou Recreation Club, due to insufficient space at its old address, moved to No. 11, Yongkangli, North Suzhou Road, on New Year's Day this year. The club's affairs are thriving. Currently, to raise funds, a grand rehearsal is scheduled to be held at the Ningbo Association on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Hollywood's Best Films of the Past Year in the Eyes of the Audience <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Zan Xinde</p>
<p>The quality and quantity of Hollywood films in 1940 were no less than those of 1939. However, among these films, which one did Americans like the most? According to the statistics of the *Oregonian* magazine, selected from 500 films, the audience's favorite was a plot-driven drama, followed by comedy, then adventure and biography films, and finally musicals.</p>
<p>The so-called most favored plot dramas include "Rebecca," "The Grapes of Wrath," "The Great McGinty," "Waterloo Bridge," "The Letter" (starring Bette Davis, not yet released in Shanghai), "Kitty Foyle" (starring Ginger Rogers, not yet released in Shanghai), "The Shop Around the Corner," and "The Philadelphia Story" (starring Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and James Stewart, not yet released in Shanghai).</p>
<p>The best three comedies are all related to marriage issues. The first is "My Favorite Wife," the second is "His Girl Friday," and the third is "This Thing Called Love," which has not yet been released in Shanghai. There are also two others, Disney's "Pinocchio" and "Boom Town," starring the four stars Gable, Spencer, Lamarr, and Colbert. In addition, there are two comedies satirizing politics, namely Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" and "The Mark of Zorro" starring Tyrone Power. (Editor's note: This film was recently shown at the Cathay Theatre, the content is very good, but unfortunately, it was not noticed by the people of Shanghai.)</p>
<p>Regarding adventure films, they considered the best to be "Northwest Passage," "Foreign Correspondent," "The Sea Hawk" (none of which have been released in Shanghai), and "The Sign of Zorro," which was released not long ago.</p>
<p>Among the biographical films, the best are "Edison, the Man," "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet," "Young Tom Edison" and "Edison the Man".</p>
<p>1940 was not a year for musicals, with only a few outstanding ones. The best are "Strike Up the Band" and "Spring Parade," both works by Deanna Durbin, the third is "Down Argentine Way" starring Annabella.</p>
<p>Among the directors, John Ford, Sam Wood, and Alfred Hitchcock are most admired. "Kitty Foyle" and "The Great McGinty" are both works by Wood; "Rebecca" and "Foreign Correspondent" are both the result of Hitchcock's efforts, and Ford is the director of "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The Long Voyage Home."</p>
<p>Chaplin does not seem to be very valued, the reason is that in production, he is not limited by time, he has only four works in twelve years.</p>
<p>The best films are adapted from the most popular novels. According to statistics, six out of ten films last year were taken from famous works.</p>

<p>— He Tu</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng's first edition of "New Journey to the West" has been decided to be staged from the evening performance on March 1st.

<p>Xun Huisheng has been hired by the Golden Grand Theatre and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on March 3rd and will likely take the stage around the 7th.</p>
<p>The second edition of Ouyang De at the Gong Stage has begun preparations and will be rehearsed and performed immediately. Zhao Ruquan will still play the two roles of Yang Yaowu and Ouyang De.</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng, the leading actor of the Tianchan Stage, resigned from the troupe and refused to rehearse the thirteen editions of Huang Tianba, according to a message from a certain stage.</p>
