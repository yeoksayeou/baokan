<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論德蘇關係</h3>
<p>一週來世人最注目的國際動態，與其說是美德邦交的日益惡化，母寗說是德蘇關係的神秘演變；因爲前者是早已註定了的，美國之反德，原爲舉世共見的明顯事實，而後者却爲一個撲朔迷離的悶葫蘆，戰爭呢，還是進一步的合作呢？這幾幾乎已是每一個留心時事者所急於探究的疑問。假定德蘇果如近日所傳，終於公開衝突，則後世的歷史家在紀述最近兩年的德蘇關係，眞不知將用些什麽字眼，纔能描寫得恰到好處，因爲在短短的二十二個月中、先由本來互相嫉視，互相謾駡的國交，一變而成爲志同道合携手共進的睦誼，然後又由親善的友邦，再變爲用兵的對象，這樣「閃電式」的邦交，不愧爲近代國際外交史上的一個新紀錄。</p>
<p>關於德蘇會不會戰一個問題，人們在這些天錯綜複雜甚至矛盾抵觸的許多報道之中，簡直無法下一斷語，不過：德國的陳兵邊境，紅軍的舉行演習，羅馬尼亞芬蘭兩國的動員以及德土友奸條約的成立，却都是鐵一般的事實。世人平時評論蘇聯外交，慣常視爲神秘莫測　事　上近日莫斯科當局對於外間種種傳說，除由通信社發一令人不能完全置信的「官樣吾認」之外，的確也始終諱莫如深，甚至連報紙評論。也看不到半個字。這種不易索解的緘默，當然更容易引起人們的懷疑。因爲，無論在那一個國家，遇到這樣關係國運的重大問題，即使是謠言，至少負言論責任的，應該加以評述或辨正，像眞理報消息報這樣地不着一字，未免有點不近情理；在這種情形之下，吾人對於蘇聯今後的動向，自然也祗好暫時不去越俎代庖，妄加揣測，好在形勢愈逼愈緊，「莫斯科向何處去」這一個謎，相信等不到半月，必然揭開。</p>
<p>關於英德部份。一切動向都比較明顯得多。就中德國雖也不無令人莫測高深之概，但祇限於它未來攻勢的對象問題，至於根本方針，並沒有什麼晦澁的地方，就大勢講，吾人至少可以斷言：德國今後必須繼續發動攻勢，以打擊英國，同時鑒於美國對歐政策的躍進，吾人更相信德國必須爭取時間。爲什麼呢？因爲依照希特勒的作戰計劃，他必須在英國自大西洋彼岸取得充分接濟，力足奪取制空權和穩定制海權之前，擊敗英倫政府，這是毫無疑問的，不然的話，他兩年來所造成的「偉大」戰績，便有全部毀滅，前功盡棄的危險。萬一不能如期擊敗央國，他至少也須使德國自身在資源的取給上，在戰具的生產上，能夠敵得上英美兩國之和：換句話說，假定英國今後每月能自美國取得若干數量的飛機，軍械，商船，糧食和石油，德國除本國所有者外，至少也應該自歐洲各戰敗國或「其他」方面，奪取相當數量的同樣物資，以免相形見絀，而使英國的作戰力，尤其是空軍實力逐漸超過了它。所以單就這一點而論，英德兩國在歐戰的現階段中，彼此雖都沒有進行什麼決定性質的戰事，却正在各以全力推進着一種爭奪戰，亦即「爭取時間充實作戰力」的爭奪戰：英國一方加强各自治領的助力，一方正促進美國的加緊援助，此在德國，則一方組織所謂「歐洲新秩序」，以進一步榨取各戰敗國，另一方則正向蘇聯進行神經戰，希圖兵不血刃而自此一「友邦」，取得更多的接濟，尤其是糧食石油的大量接濟。</p>
<p>假定上述的推斷還正確，則目下可以想像得到的，乃是德蘇兩國的「討價還價」。當然，希特勒還是「一仍舊貫」：一手執着盒子砲，一手遞過一紙「默書式的條的或協定」，要求蘇聯簽字，萬一蘇聯不肯就範，第一步想必又是慫恿羅馬尼亞或芬蘭開始所謂收復失地運動，以刺激蘇聯，困擾蘇聯，而自已却不妨躱在幕後，暫時不和史丹林政府直接破臉，此其方怯，或者竟和日本前此慫恿泰國和越南爲難的技倆，相差不多。假定蘇聯決定武力應付，德國當然暗助羅芬作戰：假定蘇聯不願用兵。或用兵而重演上次對芬戰事的久戰無功，則希特勒正好挺身而出，以「調人」自居，從而向莫斯科討一份厚禮。</p>
<p>但是，無論德國今後直接或間接對蘇有何行動，其在整個戰事中，祇算是一種手段，而不是目的，因爲希特勒的最後目標，仍在多方充實自已的作戰力量，以備他日應付英美兩國的長期聯合作戰，因此，他在對蘇交涉中，必然極盡威逼利誘的能事，以期盡量避免眞正的衝突，這是不難斷言的。支、平均國民負担、（丙）實行總理土地政策與糧食政策（六）說明田賦劃歸中央徵收之理由及其效果、（七）糧食問題與抗建的關係、應遵行總理關於糧食的遺敎、徹底解決、（八）政府實施糧食管制、完全爲建國福民、國民必須有糧出糧、絕對遵行、竭誠協助、（九）說明戰時軍糧與民食的關係及其性質、（十）希望大家依照今天的指示、徹底研討、切實執行、來達到此次會議的目的、完成抗建的使命（二十一日電）</p>

<p>路透社二十一日華盛頓電羅期福總統對於德潛艇擊沉美船雜賓摩爾號事、未向國會提議報復辦法、但於昨夜以。</p>
<p>特別咨文</p>
<p>送交國會、蓋在咨文中總統可用激昂詞句、暢所欲言、不似正式外交牒文措詞宜稍和緩也、總統在此咨文中、未表示美政府所擬保護海上美船之任何步驟、蓋不欲使德國預知美國將武裝其貨船、抑將派軍艦護送也、總統聲明、美國不擬對德放棄公海之使用、並指德潛艇之擊沉美貨船爲肆無忌憚之國際暴行、總統謂、德國此傘之一般旨趣、在使美國商務之可認爲有碍於德國計謀者、絕跡於大洋中、而其特殊旨趣、則在阻斷吾人對各友邦之貿易、吾人於此必視爲德國已發美國船隻或貨物無論在何海洋、胥小能免於海盜剽襲之間知矣、在實際上吾人巳接通知、德國欲威脅美國、庶使吾人不復進行吾人援助英國生存之已定政策、簡言之、吾人必須視羅賓摩爾號之沉失、爲美國不得反抗德國征服世界的行動之警吿、亦爲美國苟米獲納粹同意、不得使用世界公海之警吿、苟吾人從之、則吾人直承認世界宰割權操於德國目前領袖之手、要知吾人現</p>
<p>不曲從之、亦不擬曲從之也、羅賓糜爾號遭擊沉時、未有謀取船客船員安全之布置、此船懸旗、並有標識、其爲美籍船隻、德潛艇艇長固未嘗不知之、而此潛艇則旣無旗號、亦未宜布其國籍、總之德潛艇之擊沉美船、實公然破壞美國船隻除須承認國際公法所定交戰國權利外、自由行於海中之權利、而此交戰國權利、爲德政府所知者並不含括故意擊沉商船而置船客、船員的生命於驚濤駭浪中之權利、國際公　固明明規定、須置船客、船員於安全處也、美船客等之幸而遇救、要不能减輕聽令救生艇飄泊於大洋中之野　罪惡、此種對於國際公法與人道最簡單原則毫不顧慮事、使羅賓摩繭號之擊沉、成爲國際暴行、美政府對此强暴而莫可辯護的擊沉美船事、使德國負責、凡美人所受之損失、須德政府予以賠償、羅賓摩爾號船客與船員、分乘救生小艇飄泊海上的歷二三星期之久、始偶經友船見而救之、美政府相信人類之免於暴行與非人道待遇、乃一種</p>
<p>天然權利、非暫處於可施武力以應付無防禦的人民之地位者、可得隨意蔑視之也、設此意外事件可視爲別無意義、則事態可不若是嚴重、惟此事必須就德國歷來所用的公開宣布與積極進行之恐怖與威嚇手段、視爲國際政策之工具者而解釋之、美政府僅可假定德政府希望以加於無助與無辜的男女與幼孩之此種不明譽行爲、威嚇美國與他國、使之趨入對於德國征服世界的計劃、不加反抗之途徑、而其所用以征服世界者、厥爲陸地之非法暴行與海洋之强盜行爲、德國此次對美而施之方法、與德國目前領袖向來所用之恐怖方法完全適合、惟德國領袖所當知者、美國旣不受威嚇、亦決不默認德國目前領袖所擬支配世界之計劃、吾人有理由以老慮羅賓摩爾號案是吾爲反美行動之一步驟與對他國之行動、同出一轍、吾人不能信賴官塲與此相反之宜言、蓋德政府對於許多國家曾發同樣文吿、宣言、以及莊嚴諾言、其最初之文吿、爲德政府旣以武力奪取奧大利後、自認其</p>
<p>土地慾望</p>
<p>業已要足是也、德政府繼續擬征服各國宰割世界之證據、使人恍然而無所疑、就此點觀之、羅賓摩爾號之被擊沉、乃德國政策與其所用方法之披露、故平日非法暴仃、乃陸地征服計劃之先聲、而今之事件、則顯爲德國意欲奪取公海統治權之第一步驟、蓋非攫有此權利、則不能征服英國也、</p>
<p>路透社廿一日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統致國會咨文在此引起之第一反響、爲總統在其歷屆燼邊談詁中、或平日宣布政策時、從未對德國與其方法發猛烈抨擊之詞如此次咨文之甚者、其最重要一節、爲美船將在任何海洋中遭遇海盜行爲數語、總統之發此言、無異昭吿國會與民衆、德國現至少在海上</p>
<p>對美作戰</p>
<p>也、有資格觀察家、認此咨文在發展美國政策與啟迪美國人民上極關重要、此文使民衆準備作最後之奮起、而此最後奮起現已在人人期待中、衆皆知語言與抗議、胥不能阻止德國復演其所欲爲之舉動、故相信此次咨文含有較表面上所流露者更大之意義、總統所稱、美國旣不屈服亦不擬屈服及德國官塲宣言絕不可恃等語、涵有美國不久將有其種行動之意、事有當然者、美國將以正式嚴厲抗議送交柏林、惟衆料美國今後行動未必繫於德國之答復、據此間所有之第一猜測、美國商船不久或將武裝、國防出產委員會委員民主黨參議員裴思士指總統此决咨文爲宣戰之揭幕者、謂渠極贊同總統之見解、渠信美國人民亦有同一感想云、民主黨參議員特魯曼亦稱、渠贊成總統所構擊沉美船事乃海盜行爲一節、惟共和黨衆議員任金斯謂、渠所欣然者、總統未請求宣戰云、</p>
<h3>德對美凍結資金　認係參戰措施　德義要求美國封閉領署　法國利益直接蒙受影響</h3>
<p>海通社二十一日柏林電　關於美國凍結德·義在美僑民資金一事、德外部發言人評稱、此爲美國政府之一種參戰措施、前美國凍結德佔領國之資金時、尙飾詞稱其舉動之如何合理、但此决則毫無表示、美國之此項措施、達反一九二三年十二月八日德·美所訂之貿易條的、該的規定兩國以最惠國之條件優待對方之僑民、美國此種侵略性之措施、係根據國籍及領土原則、故所有一切屬於德·義僑民之資金均包括在內、此乃欲以美國之資金封鎖、以協助英國之封鎖歐洲、但美國之此項措施、對美國之利益受害亦甚大、倫教失其爲世界經濟中心之後、多數人以爲紐的可繼起而代之、但此種發展、勢將不能實現、因資金被凍結之主人、均不能忘記美國不合法之措施、柏林方面相信、美國之此種措施、將漸使國際之經濟投資分爲東·西二半球、德國對此無所畏懼、德國在美資金之被凍結者、的計一萬萬一千萬馬克、德方證券及對美換貨之尾數、所餘極微、不足掛齒、至德在美商行之資產早已變賣、至於美在德資金之被德凍結者、數達十七萬萬馬克、遠比德方之損失爲多、故美國之此項措施、對美實有害無利云、</p>
<p>海通社二十一日柏林電　關於德政府要求美當局停閉在德及佔領區域之美國領署及捷運公司之事、據德外部發言人評稱、此種措施、早應實行、故此事不能視爲德國採取報復手段、德當局早已探悉、該項美國機關之僱員·以德國消息供給英國情報局·其辦法係由華盛頓轉達英國·德國案卷中充斥此項證據、但德國以寬大爲懷、不願進行嚴厲之措施、直至美國違背國際慣例、毫無充份理由·關閉在美國之德領署機關後、於是德政府乃放索此種寬大態度·而採取此項完全合理之舉動云、</p>

<p>合衆社二十日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨將美國所有煤油出產、置於嚴厲之出口統制之下、此爲禁運此項給養之最嚴厲措置、此項命令係繼最近所宣布東海岸各省因缺乏油船而發生嚴重之油慌以後而發者、總統禁油之命令、日本蘇聯及其他國家、除特別難免者外、向美國取得仟何煤油出產以前、應取得出口照會、各東西岸海口、因此可任意請求禁運此項命令目前將應用於東部沿海煤油之禁運、英國、埃及暨拉丁美洲則例外、總統之命令稱、「由墨西哥灣或美國之太平洋口岸煤油之禁運未加考慮」、惟煤油出產旣經全部遭受出口統制、總統自將成立此種禁例之機構、日人最近嘗在費城謀求獲油二十五萬二千加侖然爲國防煤油統制官伊克斯所阻止、衆信總統之命令、目的在於遏阻未來由東部海岸油運之可能云、</p>

<h3>糧食　造作工部局定米不繼之說　思掀動米價上騰　好在此種謠言想不難即日揭破</h3>
<p>昨市洋米、又見鋒鋩、且謠諑紛起、人心淆惑、市面更見混亂不堪、但平價港米公賣價一百十元始終普遍發賣、工部局旣負責維持於始、勢必繼續安定於後、市民大可安心、一任投機操縱者擾亂市面、再度自食其惡果可也、惟晨間開市後、有內地汕頭各幫採辦、市面突呈挺秀、期現各米一致上升、比之前日漲起二三元不等、尤以英華司爲俏、一號西貢原包到一百四十七儿、小絞一百叫十六兀至一百四十七元碎米一百十五兀又七月一百十二三元、及到下午謠諑更多、竟傳工部局前額小絞三千噸、除五百噸作實批出外、尙有二千五百噸復電不轉、且謂以後更難接近云云、因此人心更激昂、小絞英華司立時到一百五十元、現貨市石到一百念五元、一號西貢每市石到一百三十元、飛黃騰達、莫能遏阻、而人心與市面更見混沌不能淸晰矣、全日成交三萬包又二千噸、計收盤一號西貢爲百念六元、二號百十九元半、一號暹邏百念五元特尖百卅一元、二號高百念兀、决百十八元、茄佛米百念三四元、敏黨百念三元、小絞浦東棧百念一元、浦西棧百念元零五角、東京砶尖高自百十四元、次至百零八元、米菉百零六元、碎尖九十七元至九十五元、三號碎八十五元、比前收價較有回漲二三元不等、</p>
<p>但工部局洋米又有到滬，怡和洋行民生輪昨午抵埠由香港裝來工部局洋米一萬包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、際此霉令天氣、米質不耐擱置、以素昔而論、斯時來源本屬最旺、後以時過景遷、情形迴異、不再爲常例、到貨反比平時爲少、且或中斷、昨則突出意料、竟一湧而抵埠、有南港一帶早晚稻不下四百餘石、頓開今庚國米來源之新記錄、致使市面立受影響，雖當洋米復昂、不能相與起伏、貨主售意旣鬆、銷塲尤覺不振，貶短一二元、開南港新鮮早晚稻百三十三四元、中次祇百三十一元至百三十元零五角、原包以及宿貨且均無做開、至無錫原包宿粳、當此環境、難免牽連帶小元砠、開百念六元、</p>
<p>糯米市貨旣屬不多、且値洋米回緊之際、其市面本似可以並秀、但去路不暢、仍惟飯担等一些零星胃口、致售價難提、猶屬定局、所開國洋兩貨行情悉與前相仿、</p>
<h3>粉巿漲風更厲</h3>
<p>洋粉迭向高　邁　、蓋自本週二開始提漲以來、每包巳加起元半至二元、其漲勢亦頗爲迅速、皆由於海外來源頗多問題、及本年新麥收成旣歉、又被嚴厲統制、華廠原料、勢將無以爲繼、平賣粉亦必中止、故人心莫不向上、本客囤風復熾、致市面節節上展、上午開盤金龍粉即在買風中抬至三十二元一二角、中途稍挫、一度進關、迨下午買氣復盛、金龍粉重昂至三十二元四角新高峯、砲台粉昂達卅三元至三十三元三角、比上日又漲一元左右、尙有福壽牌及當天牌價做三十二元四角、晚市又亦昂至三十二元七八角、成交的有三萬包光景、</p>
<p>小麥交易、毫無做開、因新麥嚴厲統制、無法來滬、且內地產價更隨申粉提高、販運更難合劃、是以市塲進出全無、恐一時難於開展云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　苞米生豆油　無一不上漲</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市面、因被米市潮流支配、行情一再轟升、一般囤胃”搶帽子踢球皮又蠭　活動、苞米行情前日曾挫跌一元六七角、昨市反做高一元八化角、成交二千餘包、計西貢夾新苞米自二十五元五角至二十七元、又全陳苞米由二十五元五角至二十六元、荷蘭白苞米二十八元至二十八元八角、又黃苞米二十九元至三十元、黃豆無發展、花生油及豆油再漲一元至一元五角不等、計大速豆油價自一百七十六元五角至一百七十九元、成交一百五十桶、漢口豆油八十桶、價爲一百七十八元、大有廠豆油二百擔、價爲一百三十元、及靑島花生油三十桶、價爲一百八十二元、豆餅期現分道背馳、現餅因銷塲淸淡、市跌四五角、期餅多頭趁其他漲風而抬頭、結果比上日提升三四角、行情詳載巾價欄、該市塲暑期下午休市、議定自七月一日起至八月十五日云</p>

<p>巿况先緊後平</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市英美均平、印銀略長、各國滙兌美對英小半分、餘平、中央掛牌各滙未更、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨央滙三辦士三二八一二五，美金五元四三七五、華商投機家首來力扒六七月美金五元四〇六二五，市况軟化、滙豐掛牌各滙皆平、白銀平衡稅仍微百分之二四·二五、廣幫來扒進英金三辦士二一二五亦趨軟、及聞日行出滙豐現美金五元四三七五、投機家亦來轉塞、市勢步見回硬、午刻尤賤、七月五元四六八七五始可售、正午收市、現貨至七月均英金三辦士三二八一二五、獎金五元四三七五、均與上日價同云、</p>

<h3>金巿動盪不寗　現貨亦稍跌</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、先漲後忽轉跌、六千四百兀大關兩度衝出後即又回入、各方人心由堅而後轉疲、乃於午刻忽謠美艇父被德方擊沉、故雖有芬蘭動員、德蘇緊張空氣復濃、因外滙由緊回半、金號及廣幫買意中淡、滬西幫突來出籠、故價升至六千四百十三元後、於午收前銳退至六千三百七十三元、終又軋小三元、半日交易一萬五千兩、下午週六無市、飾金等仍平、現金明鹽售予順源十兩、價照期交高三百五十元、軋過前微跌、掉期六月轉入七月、賣方貼出予買方五十五元、</p>

<h3>外幣漲後回平</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價漲後轉跌、英美金鎊亦係漲後回平、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票雖曾高至三角九分、但收盤又　爲十八元三角、結果與日相同、香港票趨勢堅挺、市價略漲、日金票及朝鮮票均趨堅漲、前者高至一元八角八分、後者升爲一元五角八分、</p>

<h3>證劵　公債買戶出籠</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市以謠言雖毫無根盤、但在高價時、每易受到影譽、昨日本應看好、但一部份多頭出籠、賣出雖不多、而買方已覺氣餒、市價乃微現挫折、昨係週六、祇做上午一盤、於十一時開市、初做因信孚仍有進胃、開價尙微高二三角、但以益昌樂茂賣氣爲甚、大通雖有買進、協康又有賣出、丙種二元行市、幾度進出、終仍行打破收盤、不過交易較少、起落究屬有限、結果除丁種未有做開外、餘均略小一角至三角、成交的一百二十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　多空陣容掉位　紗巿猛進疾退　最高價見一五四四元</h3>
<p>連述兩日之紗市、昨則又呈猛進疾退之象、此因證券幫扒空之故、同時粤幫對於三二支金鷄大發、二十支牧羊、十支紅雙馬等紗、銷塲有七白餘包、於是人心振作、檯面一緊、買氣尤濃、二十支雙馬曾一屢漲至千五百四十四元、價格旣高引起獲利者吐出、回落二十元、二十支雙馬高價一千五百四十四元、低價一千五百二十五元、午後因週末成交寥寥、目前紗市、業中某大戶等大都將雙馬廠單賣完、惟業外者復來拖進、多空兩方之陣容、業已掉防扳位矣、查五月二十七日之低價爲一千三百七十二元、昨日之高峰巳達一千五百四十四元、漲起一百七十二元、今日有棉紗二千八百二十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、氣勢較緊、因空頭一律扒補、首盤價爲一千五百二十五元、在二十六七元稍有進退、少頃漲至一千五白三十三四元、有一部份盈利人吐出、回挫至一千五百二十五元、一霎間謂金子上升、粤銷未衰、買氣忽濃、又升至一千一百四十叫元、豈料十二時巳過、標金突落、人心廢鬆、忽跌至一千五百二十五兀、收盤價一千五百二十六元、查半日間成交統計一萬零七百二十包、內香港幫進七百二十包、同行皮球生意一萬包、</p>
<p>金雙馬標紗市况續趨前進、因空方抵補、多頭加碼、所以檯面較緊、查七月期漲十五元、八月期漲一元半、但收盤後七月期較疲、查該所營業、目見兩進、故半日成交大旺、的有一萬包以外、茲將半日間高低價錄左、</p>
<h3>細絨喊價太高　有礙廠銷</h3>
<p>現棉情　續昂、以粗絨爲主要交易、細絨如米特林及巴四棉之類已成稀貴之品、故執貨者居奇甚烈、叫價太高、有礙消費、廠方難以下手、所以成交不及昔日之興奮、惟大衆對於粗絨原料、價格比較尙平、連日採辦反覺熱鬧、昨週末成交的計一千四百二十件、又一百八十包、價漲二三元、</p>
<p>蘭貢花　二三〇　榮豐　二〇〇件　送廠</p>
<p>火木架　二〇二　合豐　一六〇件　送廠</p>
<p>米得林　四七五　號家　一〇〇件　棧交</p>
<p>巴西花　四三六　號家　一一〇件　棧交</p>
<p>白洛去　一六〇　號家　一〇〇件　棧交</p>
<p>亞姆拉　二二三　號家　一〇〇件　棧交</p>
<p>亞姆拉　二二五　號家　二五〇件　棧交</p>
<p>蘭貢花　二一二　號家　三〇〇件　棧交</p>
<p>蘭貢花　二一二　號家　三〇〇件　棧交</p>
<p>火機花　一九四　號家　一八〇包　棧交</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、良以現紗扶搖直上、同時國外棉市、一再高漲、而訂購頗費周折、棉市仍屬緊俏、昨日除花號家成交大批巴西棉外、廠方購意亦勁、兼之更有二三批阿根廷及印棉成交也、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、因有紐奧倫斯買進及空頭扺補熱烈、市况活潑堅昂、昨日收購價格、較之上日漲五至十一磅音不等、</p>
<p>又電、去年八月一日起、至今年六月二十日止、美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>上市累計　二、六一六、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>廠用累計　九、一六四、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>出口累計　一、〇一三、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>至日本　三一、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>至中國　七九、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>至英國　三七　、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>至德國　一二九、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>各港市市　五、七三九、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>印　棉市、先因投機者及同業買進而漲、後因一部分獲利了結稍跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日各漲二至八羅比不等、又預測今日開盤巿况看高一羅比</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋投機狂熱　補空與囤貨齊飛</h3>
<p>廠布昨市、因東疋補空猛升、人心向昂、同業及囤戶搜購散額廉貨、執貨者意態觀望、廠盤亦見提高、故各布售盤一致上趨，白貨粗細布斜紋各漲每疋二角半至五角、漂染布加起五角之譜、成交數量不旺、本街辦坯布漂染布二百餘件、北路烟台靑島幫辦輕重磅粗布一百餘件、粤港　卡其藍布兀斜二百餘件、南洋幫辦怡和綸昌等廠漂染布粗布一百餘件、今日有疋頭一千三百十四件運香港、</p>
<p>東布漲風續熾、蓋以紗價昂騰、實鋼開展、再則市上游資充斥、業外囤戶視布疋爲低廉、連日搜辦數額　鉅、各檔現貨頓感缺俏、故白貨細布又漲每疋七角半至九角、細斜漲五角至七角半、龍頭細布廠棧單午刻收盤價爲四十七元一角半、龍頭細斜亦抬全四十三元七角半、取引所各月期布亦續升七八角不等、一般空戶忙於扒補、已不若前之聲勢矣、色貨四君子嗶嘰晨開一元五角八分、一度升至一元五角九分二釐半、中途散戶獲利吐售、回至一元五角七分八七五、終以棧單籌碼枯竭、業外購囤、始至一元五角九分收盤、</p>
<h3>糖巿　糖價復鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢轉軟、略有回鬆、公會劃蠜現貨二四粗白外棧六月份入口九十一元、降七角、四月份入口八十八元六角、三月份入口八十八元四角、小三角、一月份人口八十七元八角、降七角、太古車白亦隨鬆B嘜一百零五兀六角、小四角、HM嘜七十五元降五角、餘乏成交、</p>
<h3>棉　（五）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>論到歐洲人的最初穿著棉製的衣服，只能追溯到公元十二世紀：那是十字軍東征的結果，而且這種衣服是非常被人珍視的。其後交通頻繁，棉織品的輸入西歐，當然日增月盛；並且好像在十三世紀中，威尼斯的工人，已竟能模仿東方的技術而自己織造棉布了：不過所用的棉綫，恐怕自己還不能紡製而是從東方購人的呢。法國的初次相用棉花以製造物品，只能近溯到十六世紀：製造呢絨店舖的設立，在魯昂（Rouen）是一五三四年，在里昂（Lyon）是一五八〇年。至於英國和荷蘭的棉工業，也是肇始於此時的。</p>
<p>頂奇怪的是在公元十六世紀西班牙人征服新大陸的時候，他們從墨西哥到巴西，從西印度羣島到秘魯，到處看見印第安人很謹愼的栽種棉花，很熟嫻的織造布疋。這些淺陋的征服者，從前或者僅耳食棉布的名字，現在目眩於這種東西的寳貴和精巧，便强迫印第安人充作常年的質品。其中有一種棉花，絲棉　長，是現在各國栽培最廣，我們所稱爲「美國棉」的；有人以爲它的原產地就是墨西哥，又有人以爲這不過是舊大陸上草棉的另一支庶；且也，在澳洲諸島嶼上，有些種類頗多的棉花，不過如野草似的各處亂牛着，這又將怎樣去解釋它呢？這很明顯的是：我們又觸到那紛亂錯粽，不可理解的植物起源和人類起源的棘手問題了！</p>
<p>至於現在棉花出產量冠絕世界的美國，西班牙人在它那東南部佛羅里達省的初次試種棉花，不過是一六六四年；又一直等到一七八四年，纔第一次有十四包（每包二六四斤）棉花輸往英國；又過五年，巳竟變成十三萬包；及至到了一八二〇年已竟增爲六十萬包。……現在呢？……</p>

<h3>蔣委員長備受擁戴　美援華益趨積極　在精神上物質上之援助　今後必可發生更大效力　美機在重慶已與日機作遭遇戰</h3>
<p>大陸報昨日社評、題爲「美國向蔣委員長夫婦致敬」、其譯文云、「本星期四、有中美兩國官員、及金融·文化·商業各界領袖一千五百人、在紐的州紐的城、舉行盛大晚宴、席間一致向蔣委員長夫婦致敬、該一委會由威爾基主席、曾備受各來賓之熱烈歡迎、發表演說者、有魯斯夫婦、魯斯夫人稱、除美總統羅斯福夫婦外、蔣委昌長夫婦實爲全世界最偉大之人物、此種讚譽、至可重視、</p>
<p>美國人民　忠誠愛戴</p>
<p>因此種忠誠之愛戴、無疑說明除美總統羅斯福夫婦外、蔣委員長夫婦確爲美國人民最擁戴之人物、此殊可爲中國欣幸、以其國家之領袖、旣能獲得美國人民之愛戴、則美國對中國在精神上物質上之援助、定必發生更大之效力也、</p>
<p>人格高尙　堅毅鎭定</p>
<p>考蔣委員長所以受人愛戴之原因、則小外有下列數點、一·中國之最高領袖、在美國人民之心目中、已被視作全中國四萬五千萬人民抵抗日本侵略之象徵、二·蔣委員長夫婦在其事業上、已充分發揮基督徒之精神、因宗敎在美國千百萬人民中、頗有偉大之勢力、故崇拜蔣委員長夫婦之最大原因、即爲二人人格之高尙、蔣委員長能以堅毅鎭定之態度、以遏阻日軍之進攻、並揭發日方對華之陰謀、而蔣夫人亦能以同樣之態度、從而協助之、此種精神、皆能使美國朝野熱烈同情與了解蔣委員長夫婦及其所領導之全中國人民、實屬偉大之至、</p>

<h3>美助華團體籌款　美金五百萬元　專充本年度購物助華用　醫藥援華會任百六十萬</h3>

<h3>工部局職員　又普遍加津貼　局方昨日公表增加辦法　並規定自五月份起實行</h3>
<p>影響物價甚鉅巿民咸表惶惑</p>
<p>衆目睽睽之工部局職員普遍再加薪給一事、自由銓叙委員會提出、經上周四開會商決緩議後、迄今幾達兩旬、社會各界人士、無不作迫切之呼籲、促請當局能顧全人民生計、免因工部局職員薪給之再增以刺激物價之上漲、對於銓叙會所提原案作最審愼之考慮、乃由銓叙會於本星期一晚召集例會　議、雖昨盛傳該案已經通過、但各界仍多疑信參半、希望下周四常會時予以吾決、不意昨日工部局竟發表正式情報、宣佈「加發職自津貼臨時辦法、」並規定自五月份起實行、不待下周常會形式上通過後宜佈、殊屬出人意料、茲將辦法錄後、</p>
<p>局方公表　生活日高</p>
<p>據工部局情報處發表　查關於本局職員所領臨時生活費津貼一案、業經本局銓叙委員會曁董事會詳加考慮、溯自上年十一月份（即上次加發津貼之時）以還、本埠生活費、已增加百分之四十有餘、用是本局決定自五月一日起核發職員臨時生活費津貼如下、</p>
<p>按照原薪　分級計算</p>
<p>（一）對於未執聘書之華籍職員、按其月薪之起首二百元部份、發給津貼百分之一八五、二百元以外部份、發給百分之一五〇、津貼之最低額、定爲每月四十五元、（二）對於執有聘書之全體職員、按其月薪之起首五百元部份、發給津貼百分之一八五、按其月薪之第二個五百元部份、發給百分之一五〇、超過一千元部份、發給百分之一二〇、「A」級職員、其薪給三分之一部份領取匯兌津貼者、按照上開辦法、對其薪給三分之二部份、發給此項津貼、</p>
<p>低薪職員　較爲有利</p>
<p>由於此次加發津貼之結果、一般薪額較低之「B」「C」兩級職員、因上述生活費之高漲情形而所得之補償、約爲百分之十三、同時薪額較鉅之職員、其所獲補償之數、則比較爲小、</p>
<p>並經規定　五月起算</p>
<p>前項辦法、係屬體恤職員之臨時措施、至於較有永久性之職員薪給、按時調整辦法、有待於本局之考量與採納、任何辦法、一經批准、其實行之期、當自五月一日起算、』</p>
<p>影響所及　關係匪淺</p>
<p>消息靈通方面、昨指出工部局職員之再度普遍加薪、可能產生兩種影響、（一）工部局職員之薪給、通常爲其他各業職工薪給之標準、去年十一月工部局職員普加生活津貼後、各業薪給亦有隨之上騰之勢、而此决再打增加、則各業職工薪給、亦必因之波動、此决工部局職員薪水之增加、亦稱因物價之高漲四成、但衆認並無與上决加薪相同之理由、故今番再度加薪、使共他各業薪水亦隨之增加、進而水漲船高、刺激物價之上昇、致使全市人民感受生計爲難之苦、此共一、（二）如工部局之經濟狀况、難以維持職員薪給之再增、則惟有藉增加捐稅或舉債以爲彌補、如以加捐論、必照新增之地皮章程附則第五十二條第三款、「工部局或訴願委員會之決定、倘成爲最後之決定、而有法律上之效力時、工部局得實施此項決定、並按照地皮章程第十條及第二十條之規定、征收捐稅」、工部局征稅權限擴大、則爲應付非常之需、工部局得依據擴大之權限徵收捐稅、其結果不問可知、</p>
<p>公共汽車　再度增價</p>
<p>又訊、關於英商公共汽車自七月一日起再增票價百分之五十一案、衆信於本周四公用事業委員會開會後、已達完全通過之地步、惟上周四局方開會時曾予緩議、但今又獲公用事業會之復議通過、故勢必由局令核准實行、而以昨日工部局宣布再加　工生活津貼後、尤爲明顯、其公佈之期、亦不必待下周四工董會開會之後、可能於二三日內即見諸事實、惟一般市民、對公用事業收費之上漲、以直接影響全體生計、故始終保持反對、而對於公共汽車或　車要價之屢漲、僅予公司當局以獲得更多利潤之機會、工部局尤無核准之理由、</p>

<h3>航空郵費變動</h3>

<h3>杜絕貼水治本辦法　統一流通籌碼　現鈔劃頭滙劃不應區分　公單制度正在研究改革</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業同業公會頃接銀行從業員之建議、以上海流通之籌碼、分「現鈔」「劃頭」「滙劃」、實則同爲國幣、而竟發生貼水升水畸形狀况、一般投機者乘機從中漁利、實有碍社會金融、以上</p>
<p>三種籌碼</p>
<p>不應有所軒輊、　將提交兩業同業公會聯席會議、研究如何統一流通籌碼、旨在便利各業杜絕投機、安定金融、一俟議有具體辦法、再行公吿實行、關於匯劃貼水、早經財政部命令取締、匯劃升水、銀行聯合準備會已設法消滅、蓋貼水與升水、均爲法令所不許、其銀行存單有批明現鈔劃頭匯劃字樣者、更應加以取締、以免人心受其影響、又錢業同業公會爲研究</p>
<p>公單問題</p>
<p>提出四項意見、組織公單問題硏究會、惟定錢業準備庫代表二人、各莊代表七人爲委員、希望各莊儘量提出意見、以便彙案討論、茲錄四項意見如下、（一）主張仍用票據交換公單報吿表、應由各莊軋準數字交錢庫、（二）規定收票時間、恢復公單制度而改善之、（三）採用票據交換所交換辦法、（四）交換時間延長半小時、互收軋過、每莊開公單一張、聞銀錢業同業公會爲半年</p>
<p>結賬休假</p>
<p>頃已決定公吿、（一）銀行業七月一日二日爲半年決算循例休假、（二）錢業七月一日二日爲半年結算休假二天、（三）各業市塲如外滙黃金紗花豆米雜糧證券五金棉布煤炭等、爲辦理半年結賬、決定於七月一日二日停市二天、準十三日起與銀錢業同時復業、並聞銀錢業準備會庫曁錢業市塲票據交換所票據承兌所等、準七月一日二日停止辦公、</p>

<p>昨據本埠美國郵船公司方面消息稱、柯立芝號等郵船及535.S.（等級）諸輪、被徵用停航後、將以C.3等級（即新近之環游世界班各船）經502、’S.　President，Fillmore　兩姊妺輪先行替代航行、班期不日即可決定、然該兩姊妹輪以船齡過老、或不充分載客、目該項船隻、亦</p>
<p>僅有頭等</p>
<p>艙位、其票價雖較535.’S（等級）各輪稍低、但因本屆中國留美學生（的計一百五十餘人）急須赴美、故將首先繼航、惟彼等對該兩輪之票價、感覺負擔太重、現公司方面巳接到航業界之建議、故該兩輪定期駛來遠東時、或可增設二三等艙位、以應一般旅客需要、至其他替代續航之輪隻、目前亦在計議中、</p>

<h3>祝前程無量</h3>
<p>諸位小學將畢業的小朋友們！</p>
<p>這幾天你們正忙着畢業攷試吧！在這大時代中，全國的兒童多數是失學了，你們居然能夠在小學裏，完成你們的學業——畢業！是多麽幸運的一間事！也是値得大家慶賀的事呀！</p>
<p>由是，你們在小學裏畢了業，就這樣地滿足了嗎？不，決不，畢　只見表示修完一個階段的意思，小學畢業，還有中學，中學畢業，還有大學，前面的路程，正沒有限量呢！俗語說：『學無止境，學無盡期。』『學到老，學不了。』小學畢業了，怎可以自滿，而逗留不進呢！</p>
<p>那末，小朋友們準備升學的，對於學校的選擇，是應富十分審愼的，吾則「失之毫釐，差以千里將蒙受極人的損失，不可不注意。至於人學校的應該努力求學，鍛煉體魄，自不必說，中國正在苦難之中，期待着你們將來一個個担負起建國的大任來。</p>
<p>就是習業的小朋友們，也沒有截斷求知的路，因爲知識技能的獲得，不是專靠學校的教育，只要你們肯努力上進，未始不能成功。古今中外的成功傳中，有多少都從艱苦奮鬥中得來的。希望你們也在困苦中鍛鍊自己，充實自己，將來自能立身社會，報效國家。</p>
<p>小朋友們！努力吧！前進吧！祝你們前程無量！</p>
<h3>戰時各國兒童生活</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>一個國家有了戰事，人民的生活，當然將受到影響。兒童旣是人民中間的一部分，他們的戰時生活，自必和平常不同。這裹就把各國戰時的兒童生活，寫在下面：</p>
<p>德國：德國向來對於兒童的訓練，是非常注意的，尤其是戰事發生以後，全德的兒童，自八歲以上，到十叫歲以下者，都迫令受初步的軍事訓練。而十四歲以上的，就都加入希特勒靑年團，受高級軍事訓練了。這一待成年，就可入伍。</p>
<p>義國：在墨索里尼統治下的義大利，木有「狼子團」的組織。分高初兩級，從事軍訓。自戰事發生以後，這種訓練，父加緊了一步，而目凡是狼子團團員，在十五歲左右的，已加入戰時服務團工作，擔任防空救傷等事，已不無相當成績。</p>
<p>英國：英國有了戰事以後，凡是大都市中的兒童，就首先撤退，遷往四鄉，使兒童的生活父了極大的變化。在鄕村之中，雖然，也有書讀，可是物質享受，遠沒有都市舒服。不過直到現在，倫敦的公園裏面，還可看見孩子們的足跡，在嬉戲玩耍，可知倫敦的兒童，事實上並未撤盡。</p>
<p>其他：美國雖未參加戰爭，但美國的兒童，爲了國內　爭空氣的濃厚，他們對於戰爭也發生了相當興趣。所談的所研究的，都是有關軍事和戰爭的問題。至於蘇聯，正和美國一樣，尙米參加戰爭，而蘇聯的兒童，一向歡喜研究工藝，這時候，更進一步，在這方面也格外注意，以冀他日有所發明而增强國防。可知蘇聯兒童，不但能吃苦，且有大志呢。</p>
<h3>閒話北極</h3>
<p>— 張家駒</p>
<p>小們友們！我們曾經在　理課上講到；北極是一個雪天冰地的地方，在那裏，皚曰的冰塊蓋沒了地面上的一切，形成了一個極目無際的冰原。嚴寒的氣候和生活資源的貧乏，使得以過慣寒地生活住在北極相近出名的愛斯基摩人也不敢住到那裹去。</p>
<p>因此，在不久以前，這個將一年當一日，半年是日，半年是夜的北極，在人們的心中成爲一個謎。照我們的想像，在那樣苦的地方，那裹會有生物存在着呢？但是在不斷的探險失敗以後，科學的進步終於使人類征服了北極，將那謎底公開出來了。</p>
<p>在一千九百三十七年七月裏，蘇聯的科學家乘了飛機在北極的冰塊上降落，他們帝了許多完備的儀器和充足的食糧，做科學的研究工作。他們在那裏住了將幾個月，在這個時期中，他們漂流了許多路，經歷過歷時數月的黑夜和長畫，結果，給我們帶來很多新的知識，下面就是他們的收穫：</p>
<p>北極有許多生物存在，在冰原上有北極白熊和海豹成羣結隊生活着，天空上有白鷗等鳥類飛過，在三四公尺冰層下面的水中有許多小生物，這一切正和我們的想像相反。</p>
<p>以前的書上常常說地球上有五大洋和五大洲：這句話原是小大正確的，現在事實證明了北極雖然是海洋，但南極却是一個大陸，這也是北極探險的收穫之一。</p>
<p>北極海也是可以利用的，現在蘇聯已經在積極進行它遠東國境和歐州部份的長期通航，冰塊上可建造氣象台，供給氣候的消息給飛機和輪船，保證他們的安全。</p>
<p>北極和南極的開發正在開始，以後我們一定可以從報紙上得到這方面的更新的知識的</p>
<h3>小朋友與嗜好</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>「嗜好」二個字的間思，我相信每一位小朋友是都懂得的：不過嗜好有好壞之別，對於這層區別恐怕有不少小朋友就很糢糊了。嗜好是人人應該有的；一個人工作過夜後，可以藉他的嗜好來調劑他的精神，一個學生如果專心用功，而不知道什麽正當的消遣，結果一定亦是很悲悽的；讓嗜好幫助我們的生活進入成功的境地，嗜好的最大意義是如此。</p>
<p>現在拿一般小朋友的嗜好來看吧。在我住的那條里內，有一個的模十歲左右的孩子；最近節儲了十元光景的錢，那是很不容易的；他却用這筆錢去買了一雙跑冰鞋，原來他有了溜冰的嗜好。還有位是我某朋友家的公郞，他的父母每一個月規定四塊錢是給他的孩子作零用的，這個孩子閑食亦不吃，小書亦不看，但　因爲羨慕上了外國影片內的　雄；所以月底米到，常常　　　　向爺媽要錢用。</p>
<p>從上面所舉的二個例子，還不算壞，若是不良的嗜好，那對於我們非但說不上什麽益處，並且還要遭到金錢時間及精神三方面的損失。親愛的小朋友們！金錢時間及精神正是你們的最寳貴的三件東西；那麽從今天起該好好的注意自己的嗜好，尤其不可沉溺在不良的嗜好中，因爲這樣是會阻礙你們的前程的！</p>
<h3>信封自製法</h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，你們不是時常寫信給你的同學及朋友嗎？富然寄宿的學生還得寫信給父母，但是在這米珠薪桂的時期，各種物價都在飛騰着，信封套不也是一樣的在漲，那柿很毛的紙做成的也須五·六角錢一扎。這樣貴，我們不妨自己做幾個用用也可以省掉幾角錢，怎樣做呢？</p>
<p>先將沒有用的洋簿簿面撕下來，用那沒有字的一面做面子，裏面呢？就是那有字的也不要緊，然後模仿信封的模樣用剪刀剪去，剪好後用漿糊黏起來就成功一只又省錢又雅潔的信封了，寄出去不是很好的嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友們不妨試一試。</p>
<h3>熱天常見的事（下）</h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>上星期日，阿亮的爸爸正講得很起緊的當兒，被他的媽媽打斷了他們倆的話匣子，所以在這個星期日阿亮特地爲了要求他爸爸講下去而不到外面去玩，就是有鄰家的孩子來叫他去玩，他便推託有事而拒絕了。他爸爸眼見得阿亮聽得如此的津津有味，便引起了他再講下去的與致來。</p>
<p>「好，我再來講別的吧！在夏天很多陣頭雨，一忽兒天晴一忽兒下雨，因此雨水是特別的多，那麽夏天爲甚麽獨多陣頭雨呢？要知道在上海的夏天，已覺得很炎熱，可是內地比了上海還要來得熱，這因爲上海佔着沿海的便宜，所以一到了夏天，各地空氣溫度高低的相差，是常有的事，如相差過大的時候，空氣便起了急劇的流動，這便是陣頭風，更把下雨的烏雲帶了過來，因此就釀成了陣頭雨，然而陣頭雨是不會下得長久的，因爲空氣的流動時時不息，不久便把烏雲吹散，雨當然不下，而太陽接着透出來，所以有一句諺語、陣頭雨，嚇小鬼，就是形容陣頭雨是多麽的短促。剛下雨就出太陽，在空中形成了一條五彩絢爛的長虹。記得祖母對着我們說：虹是指不得，指了要爛掉手指的。要知道虹是陽光照到空中的細雨滴上，光便被雨滴屈折而分成了紅，橙黃，綠，靑，藍，紫的七種顏色　列在天空中，這便造成了一條長虹。手指了，便要爛的一句話，實在是最沒有道理的迷信話。如果你的同學中還有相信這句話的，你不妨在有虹的時候，可以試給他們看看，倒底有沒有爛手指的一回事？我保險你決不會爛掉手指，這樣便把他們迷信的念頭打破了，你倒做了一件挺有意義的事。在夏天也多雷響。忽然之間，烏雲密佈，電光閃閃，雷聲轟轟，接着暴風一刮，傾盆的大雨便倒下來，所以有一句諺語：「雷催雷，雷催風，風催雨」，這倒是很確實的。記得祖母在雷饗的時候，也時常講到龍取水的一回事。是不是天上眞有龍的嗎？眞的有龍取水嗎？其實所謂龍取水，並不是龍在那裏取水，却是風代替了龍在那裏取水。你平日看見過旋風嗎？這是陸地上常有的事，當小小的旋風起時，地上的紙屑灰塵，就被這旋風打着漩渦，如旋風大時，時時把那些紙屑等升騰起來。而龍取水就是在河海裏凹起的大旋風，把河海裹的水旋絞上去，正和陸地上的小旋風捲起紙屑灰塵一樣的道理，不過河海裏的旋風力量大得異常罷了。有時在被旋風絞起的水柱裏，看見金黃的龍鱗，有人便斷定是龍在那裏取水的證據，其實這金黃色的龍鱗，是太陽光照在水柱上的反射光呢。所以龍取水的一回事也是人們誤會罷了。而龍在古代或許是有的，但到現在龍可說的絕跡的了。」阿亮聽得眼睛霎也不霎，宛然是着了迷了。</p>
<h3>幾種怪魚</h3>
<p>— 鯽</p>
<p>射水魚：射水魚是南洋淡水中的一種怪魚，它的形狀如同我們常見的鱖魚相彷，口大身短，能從嘴裏射出水彈，將水面上的昆虫擊下，當作他的食物，射擊時好像高射砲射擊飛機一般。</p>
<p>攀魚：攀魚生長在馬來一帶的淡水裏，身體扁，長的七寸左右，它能攀行登陸，攀行時以臀鰭與腹鰭的棘抵地前進，好像用脚一樣，它上陸後不用鰓呼吸，頭部有特別的構造來代替鰓呼吸，且能攀登樹木，吃樹木葉子上的露水及昆虫</p>
<p>電魟：電魟是五十多種會發電魚類中之一，它在海中十分兇猛，能從巧妙的稜形器管裏發出電來，捕食魚類時從身上發出電力，魚觸了電立刻昏迷，遂被它一口呑下；並且他的電能發出眞正的火花。</p>

<h3>嚴華周璇　婚變的癥結</h3>
<p>— 阿槑</p>
<p>影星周璇，這幾天與其夫嚴華大鬧意見，形勢已到相當嚴重階段，本刊旣二次記載，而雙方廣吿，父見於前昨本報，一駁一覆，鑼鼓着實鬧忙，在廣吿裏可以看出雙方祗說經過，未到決裂的程度，照此看來，要說言歸於好，尙有些周折，筆者從另一方面得到此事的起因，如果確實，那麼他倆不會到離婚一步，現在寫在後而，異眞有其事，希望他倆捐棄成見，重復和好如初。</p>
<p>一件事情的經過，往往有許多曲折，在曲曲折折的過程中，能認淸理路，總能達其目的，嚴周現在的情勢，就爲了這曲折的過程而顯着緊張。他倆現在把事情弄僵了，據筆者所得的消息，嚴華平日對周璇的態度，好壞不敢胡斷，但周璇　决決心請李渭濱律師提出離婚請求時，她那憔悴的臉上不期然垂下晶瑩淚珠，其內心必有相當痛苦，可是已經同居九年，一日離婚，姑不談外</p>

<h3>爲何要離婚？</h3>
<p>— 袁雪芬</p>
<p>龍鳳花燭照新人，音樂聲中結成親，郞才女貌人人讚，夫唱婦隨過光陰。今世二人能成婚，總歸前世有緣份，要是姻緣遠在天邊會成到，不是姻緣近在眼前不相逢。只要想世上男女幾萬萬，爲什麽你我二人結成婚。半夜三更人靜時，各人摸摸各人心。我對他阿有不到處？　拿人心比自心。凡事總要退步想，知足常樂眞開心。對方有了　對處，低言細語勸幾聲，一次兩次連三次、對方決非鐵石心一夜夫妻百夜恩、夫妻恩情海樣深。况且你們結婚巳數載，　于總有夫妻情。柯必爲了小事情，家庭之中風波生。打是打　　是駡，再請律帥辦離婚。早知今日要離婚何必當初來結婚　　天同他來離婚，明天同人再結婚，結婚離婚鬧不淸，律師　　生意經。人生本來戲一塲，悲歡離合各自分。看到喜劇笑　　，看到悲劇淚紛紛。人人希望大團圓，破鏡重圓眞開心。　　們休把往事放在心，從今後夫妻和好再做人。過去譬如昨　　，以後醫如今日生，要要好好做夫妻，歡歡喜喜來做人。　唱婦隨過光陰，百年偕老不離分。（却酬）界毀譽若何，以人爲感情　物而論，當非周璇之願，然何以要委律師去信提「離婚」二字呢？據說常初的動機和希望，無非想以此促嚴華改善些待遇而已，况且事情一發生，親友必來相勸，那時就可和平解決，不料嚴重於周璇出走之後，一時着急，用廣吿警吿，這樣一來，人盡皆知，事態擴大，面子攸關，便難於收拾了。所以雙方第一次在柳中浩家中談話，其重心在責問嚴華何故登報，嚴小了解她的用意，不婉言解釋，妥謀補救之法，以致形成僵局。倘若嚴華起初不公開登報，而於收到律師信後挽親友善言勸她一番，給她不再取監視的態度，不亂駡亂打的你證，也許周璇可以諒解，決無意外的　卦了。何况九年相愛，周又別無戀人，就是法律上也難搆成民法一千另五十二條之理由呢。現在形勢雖將到極端，其實嚴華不欲離婚，周璇何嘗有離婚之　？所望嚴君似據以上的意見，正心誠意的應付，準會得到美滿的結果；記者爲愛護雙方計，略有微意，不識雙方以爲何如？</p>

<p>第十一章　英姿颯爽來酣戰</p>
<p>因爲許靖守扑波口一個村裏，夜牛河邊斥候小卒瞭見流寇在河上正暗搭浮　偷渡，連忙報知許靖。許靖不敢怠慢，急率二百騎兵到河岸，在黑暗中用箭向河中搭浮橋之處射放。流寇中箭落水的也有不少。但已有許多小船駛近河岸，流寇冒着箭雨，奮勇殺上岸來。許靖揮衆迎擊，無奈自己部下人數太少，流寇源源不絕的强渡。許靖一面派人到王永泰那邊去乞援，一面力抗流寇，混戰多時，二百騎兵已損折大半，而河裏的流寇如潮湧上，恐怕已被圍不能脫身，急急突圍而出，殺奔王永泰處來報警，想要商量如何抵禦之計，又誰知王永泰的西邊李自成的大隊流寇已偷渡過河，向這邊掩殺過來？火炬照耀，有如幾條火龍，在原野中騰躍，喊聲如雷，勢甚鴟張。王永泰也不及和許靖再說什麽話，大家舉起手中兵器，指揮官軍向火光處何殺過去。這一路流寇的中將乃是李自成得寵的驍將一隻虎，姓羅，勇敢異常，每戰輒奮勇先登，跨着一匹劣馬，手舞大刀，赤裸着上身，當先向官軍營寨前猛衝。他的部卒也是久經戰陣的兒郞，是李自成的精銳。王永泰正和他相遇。一隻虎的大刀向他馬頭猛斫，勢如旋風急雨。王永泰的一枝蛇矛尙能鎭壓得住，二人酣戰五六十合。王永泰見一隻虎果然驍勇，未可輕視。一隻虎也覺得這位老將的本領十分了得，悉力狠鬥。許靖恐怕王永泰有失，挺槍躍馬，上前助戰。流寇早把他們一隊人大圈子圍住。而正而河邊的流寇也已乘機渡河，和陳家渡的一隊流寇會合着，一齊向這邊官軍圍攻。三路人馬的有七八千人數，王永泰這枝孤軍如何抵敵得住？部下死傷漸多，營寨也都被流寇踹破，乘風縱火，燒得一片通紅。</p>

<h3>Third National Financial Conference Holds Third General Assembly: Guest Fox Attends, Discussing the Functions of the Stabilization Fund; Many Important Proposals Approved, Including Adequate Local Financial Resources</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Financial Conference continued its group reviews of proposals on the 19th and 20th mornings. The Land Tax and Food Groups established a special review committee for the proposal to convert land tax to payment in kind. Chen Qicai, Yan Jingan, Gan Jiyong, Zhu Ping, Huang Tong, and Weng Zhiyong were appointed as conveners, and provincial finance ministers and experts like Wan Guoding as committee members. The third general assembly was held on the afternoon of the 20th, with 271 members attending. Also present as guests were Fox, the American member of the Stabilization Fund Committee, and Deng Xihou, the Director of Pacification for Sichuan and Kang provinces, who gave speeches. From Mr. Fox's speech, one could fully understand the active support of the United States for China. Mr. Deng also had concrete opinions on issues such as food. The proposals passed at the general assembly on the 20th included: (1) Minister Kong's proposal regarding adequate financial resources for county governments to consolidate county finances and facilitate the implementation of county administration; improving tax laws and systems; and the anti-smuggling work of materials and taxes should be coordinated by the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry to unify anti-smuggling administration and effectively implement wartime economic policies; (2) Member Huang Weiguo's proposal to enrich the funds of local material procurement agencies and adjust procurement methods to maximize purchasing power and concentrate material resources for the benefit of the war effort; (3) Member Huang Zhongyue's proposal to consider abolishing or improving the branch offices of inland freight inspection to facilitate freight transport and benefit production; (4) Member Gui Jingqiu's proposal regarding the overall relief of material production in war zones; (5) Member Wan Guoding's proposal to create preliminary land registers using oral standard map systems to facilitate the management of land tax and its collection; and to implement land value increment tax simultaneously with the implementation of land value tax; (6) Member Meng Xianzhang's proposal to request the government to formulate a food policy for extraordinary times as soon as possible and strictly implement it to suppress grain prices and stabilize public sentiment; (7) Member Hu Mingkou's proposal that after land tax is turned over to the central government and converted to payment in kind, all military food should be supplied in full amount, and before implementation, the central government should统筹统给按照实数the grain prices and expenses for the portions purchased by provincial governments, except for disaster areas; (8) Minister Kong's proposal, for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of financial administration and concentrating the strength of financial personnel, to quickly coordinate the training of financial personnel nationwide to meet the needs of the war of resistance and national reconstruction; provincial and local banks should adhere to the central government's financial policies and effectively promote them to benefit the war of resistance and national reconstruction. The meeting adjourned around 7 o'clock. The review meeting continued on the morning of the 21st, followed by the fourth general assembly in the afternoon. (Dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Fox, the American member of the newly established Stabilization Fund Committee, delivered a speech at the National Financial Conference convened here yesterday afternoon, stating that the United States is aware that it is aligned with China and the United Kingdom. The Stabilization Fund Committee's efforts for China's economy will naturally make a small contribution. The stabilization of currency relations will clearly greatly promote China's foreign trade, prevent speculation, and maintain the credibility of Chinese currency in all areas of circulation. We are handling this in the hope that the financial situation of the government and the perspective on implementing price controls and other related economic principles will have a beneficial impact on the international financial situation. However, the functions of this committee extend beyond the scope of currency relations. This committee is a symbol of friendship and cooperation between two free and independent nations. The great democratic country of the West feels pleased and fortunate to be able to cooperate with the great democratic country of the East. The extent of our success will be commensurate with our measurement of a part of our special work in currency and financial relations. If our work can contribute to strengthening the friendship between China and the United States, it will not be in vain, as it will enhance the democracy of both countries. We are well aware that China currently faces many difficult problems that need to be addressed. The establishment of the China Stabilization Fund Committee is for addressing various financial problems. However, if Chinese currency needs to be stabilized, the scope of economic problems that we must pay attention to will naturally be great, because the exchange value of Chinese currency will ultimately not exceed its purchasing power in the country. What we must pay attention to includes inflation, rising prices, the continued issuance of banknotes, food shortages, the need to increase production of military supplies and goods for the people, and transportation difficulties. We will provide prepared solutions, but our work will be greatly facilitated if we receive the full cooperation and assistance of all members of this conference. In the future, we will naturally request statistical information from various ministries and agencies of your government to assist in our research. We may from time to time suggest changes and modifications to the economic institutions in your country. These suggestions will be made only after careful study. We hope that they can all be put into practice. We can assure you that your opinions will be presented to the committee without hesitation. Our efforts are united, and we will not tolerate petty disputes, personal jealousy, or short-sighted reforms. During times of peace, civil servants in China and elsewhere can have the leisure to implement outdated methods and practices, but in today's wartime era, we cannot afford to allow them to exist any longer. We must apply new and more modern methods, even if it causes errors and unintentional mistakes. Leaders must have the vision and courage to implement taxes based on ability to pay. This tax system must be centralized in nature. Individual promotions must be based solely on merit and not on political connections or social status. Budget controls must have a well-organized and unified system. The complete transparency of national finances is a major characteristic of a democratic government. He has only been in China for a short time but has already gained some concrete impressions. The first and most important is that the Chinese people, despite severe obstacles and difficulties, are determined to fight to maintain their independence. The Chinese nation, if united and unwavering, cannot and will not be overcome. His second impression is that the national unity in your country is due to the existence of a true democratic relationship between the government and the people. His third impression is that China's resistance to aggression has not only not hindered economic and political progress, but has actually accelerated it. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reassessing German-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>In the past week, the most notable international development has been, less so the increasing deterioration of relations between the United States and Germany, and more so the mysterious evolution of German-Soviet relations; because the former was already predestined, America's opposition to Germany was a clear and universally recognized fact, while the latter is a perplexing mystery. War, or further cooperation? This is almost the question that every observant person is eager to explore. Assuming that Germany and the Soviet Union do openly clash as has been recently rumored, future historians, when recording the recent two years of German-Soviet relations, will truly wonder what words to use to describe it appropriately, because in the short span of twenty-two months, the national relationship first transformed from mutual jealousy and scolding to a harmonious alliance with shared goals, and then from friendly allies to military adversaries. Such a "lightning-fast" diplomatic relationship is worthy of being a new record in the history of modern international diplomacy.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether Germany and the Soviet Union will go to war, people have been unable to reach a conclusion amidst the complex and even contradictory reports of recent days. However, Germany's deployment of troops to the border, the Red Army's holding of exercises, the mobilization of Romania and Finland, and the establishment of the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship are all undeniable facts. When people usually comment on Soviet diplomacy, they habitually regard it as mysterious and unpredictable. In fact, recently, the Moscow authorities have remained tight-lipped about various external rumors, except for a "formal denial" issued by the news agency that is not entirely convincing, even newspaper commentary. Not even half a word can be seen. This inexplicable silence naturally makes people more suspicious. Because, in any country, when faced with such a major issue concerning national destiny, even if it is a rumor, those responsible for speech should at least comment or correct it. It is somewhat unreasonable for papers like Pravda and Izvestia not to write a single word. In this situation, we can only temporarily refrain from overstepping our bounds and making unwarranted conjectures about the future direction of the Soviet Union. Fortunately, as the situation becomes increasingly tense, the mystery of "Where is Moscow going?" will surely be revealed in less than half a month.</p>
<p>Regarding the Anglo-German situation, all trends are much clearer. Among them, Germany also has a mysterious and profound aspect, but it is limited to the question of the target of its future offensive. As for the fundamental policy, there is nothing obscure. Generally speaking, we can at least assert that Germany must continue to launch offensives to strike at Britain. At the same time, in view of the leap forward in American policy toward Europe, we are even more convinced that Germany must seize the time. Why? Because according to Hitler's war plan, he must defeat the British government before Britain obtains sufficient supplies from across the Atlantic, is able to seize air supremacy, and stabilize naval power. This is without doubt. Otherwise, the "great" achievements he has made in the past two years will be in danger of complete destruction and the abandonment of previous efforts. If he fails to defeat Central Kingdom as scheduled, he must at least ensure that Germany itself is able to match the combined strength of Britain and the United States in terms of resource acquisition and weapons production. In other words, assuming that Britain can obtain a certain number of aircraft, military equipment, merchant ships, food, and oil from the United States each month, Germany should at least seize a corresponding amount of the same materials from various defeated European countries or "other" sources, in order to avoid being outdone and allow Britain's combat power, especially air power, to gradually surpass it. Therefore, just from this point of view, although neither Britain nor Germany is carrying out any decisive battles in the current stage of the European war, they are both pushing forward with all their strength in a kind of competition, that is, a competition to "seize the time to enrich combat power." The British side is strengthening the assistance of various autonomous territories while promoting accelerated assistance from the United States. For Germany, one side is organizing the so-called "New European Order" to further exploit the defeated countries, and the other side is conducting a war of nerves against the Soviet Union, hoping to obtain more supplies from this "friendly country" without bloodshed, especially large supplies of food and oil.</p>
<p>Assuming that the above inference is still correct, what can be imagined at present is the "bargaining" between Germany and the Soviet Union. Of course, Hitler still "remains consistent": holding a pistol in one hand and handing over a "memorandum-style treaty or agreement" in the other, demanding that the Soviet Union sign it. If the Soviet Union refuses to comply, the first step will probably be to instigate Romania or Finland to begin the so-called movement to recover lost territories, in order to stimulate and困擾the Soviet Union, while he himself may as well hide behind the scenes and temporarily not directly break face with the Stalin government. This method may be similar to the trick that Japan used to instigate Thailand to make trouble with Vietnam. Assuming that the Soviet Union decides to respond with force, Germany will certainly secretly assist Romania and Finland in their operations. Assuming that the Soviet Union is unwilling to use force, or uses force but repeats the previous long and unsuccessful war against Finland, then Hitler can just step forward and act as a "mediator," thereby demanding a generous gift from Moscow.</p>
<p>However, no matter what actions Germany takes directly or indirectly against the Soviet Union in the future, it is only a means in the entire war, not an end, because Hitler's ultimate goal is still to enrich his own combat power in many ways in order to prepare for a long-term joint operation with Britain and the United States in the future. Therefore, in his negotiations with the Soviet Union, he will surely do everything possible to threaten and lure in order to avoid a real conflict as much as possible. This is not difficult to assert.支、average national burden, (C) Implementing the Prime Minister's land policy and food policy (6) Explain the reasons and effects of transferring land tax to central collection; (7) The relationship between the food problem and the war of resistance and national reconstruction should follow the Prime Minister's遗敎on food and resolve it thoroughly; (8) The government's implementation of food control is entirely for the benefit of the country and the people.

<p>Chongqing: Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening of the National Financial Conference on June 16th was published today, stating that the Chinese government will collect from landlords ten to twenty percent of the grain they produce, and may issue food bonds so that China can have a sound food production program. Food bonds are purchased with rice, wheat, or other grains instead of money, and the government will also repay with various grains when due. The Chairman emphasized that the current problem is not how much grain the government should purchase to supply the consumption of the military and civilians, but how to implement Sun Yat-sen's food policy. The Chairman warned wealthy landlords not to be stingy with ten to twenty percent of their harvest to pay land tax. The Chairman pointed out the plight of Chinese landlords in the occupied areas. The Chairman also said that the Chinese government, in a life-and-death situation, will not hesitate to adopt harsh measures to collect the grain. The Chairman also stated that the new county system will be promoted throughout the country to promote autonomy and balance the government's budget, while also balancing the people's tax burden. The Chairman also said that the Financial Conference is closely related to the current Pacification Conference and expressed the hope that the two conferences will cooperate to resolve the urgent problems of wartime finance and economic construction.

<h3>Many U.S. Army Pilots Approved to Resign and Join Chinese Air Force; Although U.S. Law Has Restrictive Clauses, Government Clearly Emphasizes Established Facts</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 21st - Government sources today declined to criticize the law passed by Congress in 1860, which is said to be a legal obstacle for American citizens to join the Chinese Air Force. Government officials said they were unaware of this law and pointed out that no one has yet requested the enforcement of this law. According to the federal law of 1860, it is prohibited for Americans to join the Chinese Air Force. The case authorizes the American Minister (now Ambassador) to forbid people from enlisting, and if necessary, may ask the U.S. Navy Department to help him carry out this matter. The legal rights of the American Minister are currently enforced by the American Court in China. It is recalled here that in 1937, many American pilots arrived in China, but in the end they were unable to join the Chinese Air Force because of this. Well-informed sources pointed out that many U.S. Army pilots have applied to resign and join the Chinese Air Force. They said that the implementation of this move has not taken into account legal issues. In theory, the enforcement of this law must be proposed by the Ambassador, but so far the U.S. Ambassador to China has clearly not been instructed to enforce this law. Federal government officials said they would rather not investigate the truth of this law than make the trouble of requesting an amendment to the law. If there are no special policies and reasons that must enforce this law, the government will not be condemned for not being able to enforce this law, and the government is particularly unwilling to amend this case to avoid the isolationists from obtaining an excuse for attack. Federal authorities may continue to regard this matter as an "established fact" rather than a "legal issue."</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York, 20th - Regarding the question of "whether the United States should hold a referendum before sending an expeditionary force to fight overseas," the American Institute of Public Opinion recently solicited opinions from the public. It is reported that 56 percent of the votes cast were in favor, and 44 percent advocated that there is no need to hold a referendum.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Sternly Reprimands Germany; Sinking of American Ship is an Act of International Outrage; The Use of the High Seas Cannot Be Abandoned; Vigorous Language in Special Message to Congress</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st. President Roosevelt did not propose retaliatory measures to Congress regarding the German submarine sinking of the American ship Robin Moor, but last night issued a:</p>
<p>Special Message</p>
<p>To Congress. It is explained that in a message the President can use vigorous language and freely express his opinions, unlike formal diplomatic documents which should be worded more moderately. In this message, the President did not indicate any steps the U.S. government intends to take to protect American ships at sea, lest Germany anticipates whether the U.S. will arm its merchant ships or send warships to escort them. The President stated that the U.S. does not intend to abandon the use of the high seas to Germany and referred to the sinking of the American cargo ship by a German submarine as a reckless act of international outrage. The President said that the general purpose of this act by Germany is to eliminate American commerce that may be deemed detrimental to German plans from the oceans, and its specific purpose is to obstruct our trade with friendly nations. We must regard this as Germany having made known that American ships or goods, no matter where they are on any ocean, will not be immune from piracy. In effect, we have been notified that Germany intends to threaten the U.S. so that we no longer pursue our established policy of aiding Britain's survival. In short, we must view the sinking of the Robin Moor as a warning that the U.S. must not resist Germany's conquest of the world, and as a warning that the U.S. cannot use the world's high seas unless it obtains Nazi consent. If we comply with this, then we directly acknowledge that the power to dominate the world is in the hands of Germany's current leader. We</p>
<p>will not submit to it now, nor do we intend to submit to it. When the Robin Moor was attacked, no arrangements were made to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew. The ship flew its flag and had markings identifying it as an American vessel, which the German submarine commander certainly knew. Moreover, the submarine had neither a flag nor declared its nationality. In sum, the German submarine's sinking of the American ship is a flagrant violation of the American ship's right to freely navigate the seas, subject only to the rights of belligerent nations as defined by international law. The German government knows that these rights do not include the deliberate sinking of merchant ships and the abandonment of passengers and crew to the perils of the sea. International law explicitly requires that passengers and crew be placed in a safe place. The fact that the American passengers were rescued by chance cannot mitigate the savage crime of forcing them to drift in lifeboats on the ocean. This disregard for the most basic principles of international law and humanity makes the sinking of the Robin Moor an act of international outrage. The U.S. government holds Germany responsible for this violent and indefensible sinking of an American ship, and the German government must compensate for all losses suffered by Americans. The Robin Moor's passengers and crew drifted in small lifeboats at sea for two or three weeks before being rescued by a passing friendly ship. The U.S. government believes that freedom from violence and inhumane treatment is a</p>
<p>natural right, which cannot be arbitrarily disregarded by those who temporarily find themselves in a position to use force against defenceless people. If this incident could be viewed as meaningless, the situation would not be so serious. However, this matter must be interpreted in light of the publicly announced and actively implemented methods of terror and intimidation that Germany has historically used as tools of international policy. The U.S. government can only assume that the German government hopes to intimidate the U.S. and other countries through these disreputable acts against helpless and innocent men, women, and children, into taking a path of non-resistance to Germany's plans for world conquest. Germany's method of conquering the world involves unlawful violence on land and piracy on the seas. Germany's current methods against the U.S. are entirely consistent with the terror methods traditionally used by Germany's leaders. However, Germany's leaders should know that the U.S. will neither be intimidated nor will it acquiesce in Germany's current leader's plan to dominate the world. We have reason to believe that the Robin Moor case is one step in anti-American actions and is consistent with its actions against other countries. We cannot rely on official declarations to the contrary, as the German government has issued the same statements, declarations, and solemn promises to many countries. The first of these statements was when the German government, after seizing Austria by force, admitted that its</p>
<p>desire for land</p>
<p>had already been satisfied. Evidence that the German government continues to plan to conquer countries and dominate the world leaves no room for doubt. From this perspective, the sinking of the Robin Moor is a revelation of German policy and its methods. Hence, the unlawful violence of the past was a prelude to a plan of conquest on land, and today's event is clearly the first step in Germany's intention to seize control of the high seas. It cannot conquer Britain without seizing this right.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st. The first reaction to President Roosevelt's message to Congress is that the President, in his past fireside chats or when announcing policies, has never launched such a fierce attack on Germany and its methods as in this message. The most important passage is the phrase that American ships will encounter piracy on any ocean. The President's utterance of these words is tantamount to announcing to Congress and the public that Germany is now, at the very least, at sea</p>
<p>Waging war on the U.S.</p>
<p>Qualified observers recognize this message as extremely important in developing American policy and enlightening the American people. This message prepares the public for a final stand, which is now anticipated by everyone. Everyone knows that words and protests cannot prevent Germany from repeating its desired actions, so they believe that this message contains greater significance than what is revealed on the surface. The President's statements that the U.S. will neither surrender nor intends to surrender, and that German official declarations are absolutely unreliable, imply that the U.S. will soon take some kind of action. As a matter of course, the U.S. will send a formal and stern protest to Berlin, but it is expected that America's future actions may not depend on Germany's response. According to the first guesses here, American merchant ships may soon be armed. Defense Production Committee member, Democratic Senator Pepper, called the President's decisive message the opening act of a declaration of war, saying that he highly agreed with the President's views and that he believed the American people felt the same way. Democratic Senator Truman also stated that he agreed with the President's assertion that the sinking of the American ship was an act of piracy, but Republican Congressman Jenkins said that he was pleased that the President did not request a declaration of war.</p>
<h3>Germany Freezes American Funds; Sees it as a Wartime Measure; Germany and Italy Demand U.S. Close Consulates; French Interests Directly Affected</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st. Regarding the U.S. freezing of the funds of German and Italian nationals in America, a German foreign ministry spokesman commented that this is a kind of wartime measure by the U.S. government. Previously, when the U.S. froze the funds of German-occupied countries, it still gave excuses, claiming its actions were justified, but this decision offers no explanation. This measure by the U.S. violates the trade treaty signed between Germany and the U.S. on December 8, 1923, which stipulates that both countries treat each other's nationals under most-favored-nation status. This aggressive measure by the U.S. is based on the principle of nationality and territory, so all funds belonging to German and Italian nationals are included. This is an attempt to use the American blockade of funds to assist Britain's blockade of Europe, but this measure by the U.S. will also greatly harm American interests. After London lost its position as the world's economic center, many people thought that New York could succeed it, but this development will inevitably fail because the owners of the frozen funds will never forget America's illegal measures. Berlin believes that this measure by the U.S. will gradually divide international economic investment into eastern and western hemispheres. Germany is not afraid of this. The German funds frozen in the U.S. are estimated to be 110 million marks, while German securities and the balance of barter trade with the U.S. are minimal and not worth mentioning. As for the assets of German businesses in the U.S., they have long been sold. On the other hand, the U.S. funds frozen by Germany in Germany amount to 1.7 billion marks, far more than Germany's losses, so this measure by the U.S. is actually harmful and not beneficial to the U.S.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st. Regarding the German government's request that the U.S. authorities close American consulates and express delivery companies in Germany and occupied territories, a German foreign ministry spokesman commented that such measures should have been implemented long ago, so this matter cannot be seen as Germany taking retaliatory measures. The German authorities had already discovered that the employees of these American institutions were providing German news to the British intelligence agency, with the method being to relay it to Britain via Washington. German files are filled with such evidence, but Germany, out of generosity, was unwilling to take harsh measures. It was only after the U.S. violated international norms, closed German consular agencies in the U.S. without sufficient reason, that the German government abandoned this generous attitude and took this completely reasonable action.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st. Haitong News Agency announces that its New York branch has ceased operations.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 20th. The governments of Germany and Italy have requested that the U.S. close all consulates in Germany, Italy, and German-occupied territories. However, it is noted that French interests in Germany, Italy, and German-occupied territories have been looked after by American consulates since the outbreak of the current European war. Therefore, France has also been directly affected by this measure.</p>
<h3>U.S. Orders Closure of Italian Consulates</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st. The U.S. has ordered the closure of all Italian consulates. All consular staff must leave the country by July 15th.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 21st. U.S.-Italian relations have become even more strained today following the official announcement that American consulates throughout Italy have been closed due to the attitudes and actions of U.S. consular officials causing serious opposition from Italians. People in Rome have repeatedly expressed yesterday that the aspects of American actions that cause Italian opposition are feared to be not limited to consular officials. Many depositors fear that due to the closure of consulates, the Italian freezing of American deposits will only intensify and not relax. Even matters stipulated in official orders as being exempt from certain deposit freezing restrictions, such as matters concerning residents and special circumstances, will be forever impossible to execute.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Governor Hosts Farewell Banquet for Ayazawa</h3>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 21st. Last night, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies hosted a farewell banquet for Ayazawa, the chief Japanese representative for economic negotiations. Due to the suspension of negotiations, Ayazawa is scheduled to return to Japan on the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Announces Control of Petroleum; Japan and the Soviet Union Included in Embargo; Peru Bans Export of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 20th. President Roosevelt yesterday placed all U.S. petroleum production under strict export control. This is the strictest measure to embargo this supply. This order follows the recent announcement that the eastern coastal provinces are experiencing a severe oil shortage due to a lack of tankers. Under the President's oil embargo order, Japan, the Soviet Union, and other countries, except in particularly unavoidable cases, must obtain export licenses before obtaining any U.S. petroleum products. All ports on the east and west coasts can therefore arbitrarily request an embargo. This order will currently apply to the embargo of petroleum on the eastern coast, with Britain, Egypt, and Latin America being exceptions. The President's order stated that "the embargo of petroleum from the Gulf of Mexico or U.S. Pacific ports has not been considered," but as petroleum production has been entirely subjected to export control, the President will naturally establish a mechanism for this kind of prohibition. The Japanese recently attempted to obtain 252,000 gallons of oil in Philadelphia but were stopped by Ickes, the National Petroleum Coordinator. It is generally believed that the President's order aims to curb the possibility of future oil transport from the eastern coast.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Peruvian Capital, 20th. The Peruvian government today issued an order banning the export of raw materials such as tin, iron, lead, aluminum, copper, steel, and rubber. It is reported that this ban will soon be extended to other raw materials.</p>

<h3>Surprising Developments in the Current Situation; Germany and the Soviet Union May Reach a New Agreement; Negotiations Between the Two Sides are Clearly Underway; German-Turkish Cooperation Has a Significant Impact on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, Zurich, 21st. According to sources here, there are rumors in Berlin that the German Reichstag will soon be convened. These rumors have not been confirmed, but if this is the case, it may be related to surprising developments. Political observers here generally believe that Germany does not want to go to war with the Soviet Union, but hopes to establish an agreement with it to maintain strict neutrality in future wars. It is possible that such an agreement has already been concluded, or perhaps it is only in the process of negotiation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 21st. A dispatch from Berlin reports that it is expected that Hitler will soon meet with the Soviet ambassador to Germany, Dekanozov. The Soviet ambassador has visited the German Foreign Ministry three times this week, once meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the other two times being received by German Foreign Ministry State Secretary Weizsäcker. At the same time, Berlin officials still say they do not know if Soviet-German negotiations have yielded any results.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 21st. Reliable sources have recently stated that Germany has indicated to the Turkish government its willingness to cede a narrow strip of land belonging to Greece in Thrace to Turkey. This narrow strip of land is inhabited by a large number of Turks. Authorities here consider this news to be very important and believe it confirms reports that Hitler considers the German-Turkish non-aggression pact signed on Wednesday to be a tool to force Turkey to recognize Germany's power. It is generally believed that Germany's offer to Turkey is consistent with the German strategy of achieving its goals through threats and inducements. If diplomatic experts believe that the report of Germany concentrating more than 100 army divisions and large air forces near the Soviet border is intended not only to obtain concessions from Moscow, but also to restrain Turkey so that it will follow its wishes and prevent the Red Army from acting, making it impossible for the Red Army to interfere. It is generally believed that Germany is also trying to find a way for Turkey to allow German troops and military supplies to pass through Turkish territory. If Germany does not take advantage of the Turkish coastal base and the Dardanelles Strait, it will try to achieve the goal of transit through Turkish territory. If German troops pass through Turkish territory, they can make a fan-shaped advance through France, Iraq, and Syria, so as to approach the Suez Canal from the northeast. When the motorized and mechanized forces at the axis of the Western Desert launch an offensive against Alexandria and the Suez Canal, the troops approaching the Suez Canal from the northeast can echo the Western Desert Army. If Turkey allows Germany to establish air force bases in the Black Sea, it can bomb the Baku and Grozny oil fields from a very short distance. This will become a serious problem for the Soviet Union. The advantage of Germany and Turkey in the Dardanelles Strait and the Black Sea makes it possible to threaten the center of the Soviet oil-producing region and affect its entire economic strategy. In forcing Turkey to submit, Hitler also tried to curb the Soviet Union's counter-action. Experts are assessing the criticality of the German troops concentrated in the direct lines from Finland to the Caspian Sea from this perspective and in view of the reported German demands on the Soviet Union. There is still no proof of news about demands to the Soviet Union. According to British officials, if this news includes the so-called German engineers who can transform Soviet industry and transportation, German-Soviet involvement in the adjustment of Ukraine, or Germany using Soviet ports and shipyards and submarine plants, then Stalin will definitely give a definite answer.

<p>Rumor That Germany Attempts to Use the Soviet Far East Fleet</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 21st. Yesterday, it was widely rumored here that Germany has requested Moscow to cede the Soviet fleet stationed in Vladivostok to Germany for use in the Pacific War. The Soviet Far East Fleet is reported to include 50 destroyers, 80 submarines, and other small warships. Some neutral observers believe that Germany's greatest hope of victory lies in winning the Battle of the Atlantic, and say that even if Soviet warships join forces with Japan in the Pacific Ocean to prevent the U.S. Pacific Fleet from being transferred to the Atlantic, it would be of great help. The Soviet fleet can be used as raiding vessels to deal with British ships. Experts also say that another military request from Germany is that the Soviet Union stop its aid to China, so that Japan has extra power to attack the British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia.</p>

After the British and Indian troops launched their attack, they captured 560 enemy soldiers, including 210 Germans. They have now penetrated deep into the enemy lines and reoccupied the positions they held for the past three months. A major sandstorm is currently raging in the Western Desert, bringing fighting almost to a standstill, and air activity is minimal.

<h3>Youth Association College Entrance Guidance Lecture Series Fourth Day (2)</h3>
<p>General Situation of Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Following that, Jiaotong University student Li Yiqin introduced the general situation of the school, saying that the school site was occupied after the war, which greatly affected teaching. The first and second grades are currently taking classes in the new Zhen Dan school building, while the third and fourth grades are taking classes on Aimeiyuyu Road, and the laboratories are scattered in three or four places. In terms of organization, it was originally divided into five colleges: Management, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Science. Later, in accordance with the Ministry's order, it was changed to three colleges. In fact, only the three colleges of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Civil Engineering were merged into one college, called the College of Science and Engineering. The College of Management is divided into the Railway Department (30 places are enrolled this year), the Industrial Department (10 places are enrolled, which is difficult to enter), and the Finance Department (20 places). Famous professors include Zhong Weicheng, Li Binghua, and An Shaoyun. The College of Science and Engineering is divided into the Department of Mechanical Engineering (40 places are enrolled this year, divided into three majors: automobile, train, and power), with famous professors such as Hu Duanxing and Chen Shiying. The Department of Electrical Engineering is divided into two majors: Communications and Power, with famous professors such as Cui Zhaolin and Zhang Tingjin. The Department of Civil Engineering is divided into four majors: Architecture, Highway, Railway, and Municipal Engineering, with famous professors such as Gu Kangle and Li Shuhe. The College of Science is divided into three departments: Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry (more difficult). As for students' extracurricular activities, some people criticize them as "very rigid." This is not entirely true, because before the war, the environment was free, the school building was spacious, and student activities were very popular. The school's Youth Association will open a "Welcome New Students Conference" before the start of the term to welcome new students. Also, the tuition fee of the school is the lowest among Shanghai universities, at only ten yuan per semester. The government subsidizes each student with 700 yuan per year. The entrance examination is as follows: The College of Management accounts for 20% of Chinese, 15% of English, 15% of Mathematics, 10% of Science, 15% of Chinese and Foreign History, 15% of Chinese and Foreign Geography, 5% of Civics, and 5% of Biology. The College of Science and Engineering and the College of Science are the same, with 15% of Chinese, 15% of English, 20% of Mathematics, 15% of Physics, 15% of Chemistry, 10% of Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, 5% of Civics, and 5% of Biology. There is also a non-unified examination, and those with a score of less than 25 in one subject will not be admitted. For Chinese, composition should be in classical Chinese, and ancient people should not be attacked. The topics often come from the Four Books. English emphasizes newspaper editorials, which have contemporary significance, and the grammar learned should be mostly useless. For the science and engineering college, mathematics focuses on analytic geometry (emphasis), algebra (second), and trigonometry (third), but sometimes the questions are mixed. There are many small questions in chemistry, and the answers should be as detailed as possible. Geography focuses on inland transportation after the war, history focuses on modern history, and chemistry focuses on differential chemistry. The registration date for the school is from July 20 to 22, and the examination is from July 28 to 31. The brochure has not yet been printed.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Food: The False Claim That the Public Works Department Has Determined That Rice Will Not Continue Incites Rice Prices to Soar; Fortunately, This Rumor Will Probably Be Exposed Soon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice showed signs of strength again, and rumors arose, confusing people and causing chaos in the market. However, the publicly sold Hong Kong rice at a flat price of 110 yuan continued to be sold widely. Since the Public Works Department is responsible for maintaining stability from the beginning, it will inevitably continue to stabilize it in the future. The public can rest assured and let speculators manipulate the market and suffer the consequences again. However, after the market opened in the morning, purchases by various domestic Shantou merchants caused the market to suddenly show strength, and both spot and futures prices of rice rose uniformly, rising by two or three yuan compared to the previous day. Especially the Yinghua Company was popular, with No. 1 Saigon original packages reaching 147 yuan, small polished rice calling for 146 to 147 yuan, broken rice 115 yuan, and July rice 112-113 yuan. In the afternoon, there were even more rumors, claiming that the Public Works Department's previous quota of 3,000 tons of small polished rice, except for 500 tons actually approved, had 2,500 tons for which the reply telegram was not transferred, and that it would be even more difficult to access in the future. As a result, people became more agitated, and small polished Yinghua Company immediately reached 150 yuan, spot market prices reached 105 yuan per shih, and No. 1 Saigon reached 130 yuan per shih, soaring and unstoppable. People's minds and the market became even more chaotic and unclear. The total transaction volume for the day was 30,000 bags and 2,000 tons. The closing prices were No. 1 Saigon at 106 yuan, No. 2 at 119.5 yuan, No. 1 Siam at 105 yuan, extra-pointed at 131 yuan, No. 2 Gao at 100 yuan, Jue at 118 yuan, Jiafo rice at 103-104 yuan, Mindang at 103 yuan, small polished Pudong Wharf at 101 yuan, Puxi Wharf at 100.5 yuan, Tokyo Pointed Gao from 114 yuan to 108 yuan, Mi Lu at 106 yuan, broken pointed rice at 97 yuan to 95 yuan, and No. 3 broken rice at 85 yuan, a rebound of two or three yuan compared to the previous closing price.</p>
<p>However, more foreign rice from the Public Works Department has arrived in Shanghai. The Yihua Shipping Company's Minsheng vessel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, loaded with 10,000 bags of foreign rice from the Public Works Department from Hong Kong, and stopped at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Zu)</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica rice. At this time of moldy weather, the rice quality cannot withstand storage. In the past, this was the peak season for supply. However, as times have changed, the situation is different, and it is no longer the norm. Arrivals are less than usual, and may even be interrupted. Yesterday, unexpectedly, it poured into the port, with no less than 400 shi of early and late rice from the Nangang area, setting a new record for the source of japonica rice in this year. As a result, the market was immediately affected. Although foreign rice rose again, it could not rise with it. Sellers were more willing to sell, and the sales market felt even more depressed, depreciating by one or two yuan. Fresh early and late rice from Kainangang opened at 133-134 yuan, and medium-grade rice was only 131 yuan to 130.5 yuan. Original packages and old goods were not traded. As for original packages of old japonica rice from Wuxi, in this environment, it was inevitably implicated and depreciated slightly, opening at 106 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice had little stock, and at a time when foreign rice was tightening, the market seemed to be able to rise. However, the outlet was not smooth, with only some retail demand from food stalls, etc., so the selling price was difficult to raise, and it remained stable. The opening prices for both domestic and foreign goods were similar to before.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market's Rising Trend is Even More Severe</h3>
<p>The price of foreign flour has been rising continuously. Since the price increase started on Tuesday of this week, each bag has increased by 1.5 to 2 yuan, and the rising trend is quite rapid. This is due to many problems with overseas supply, and this year's new wheat harvest has been poor and subject to strict control. The raw materials for Chinese factories will not be able to continue, and flat-price flour will inevitably be discontinued. Therefore, people are invariably looking upwards, and the hoarding wind has revived, causing the market to rise steadily. At the opening in the morning, Jinlong Flour was raised to 32.1-32.2 yuan in the buying frenzy. It slightly declined in the middle, once entering Customs. In the afternoon, with the buying momentum picking up again, Jinlong Flour rose again to a new high of 32.4 yuan. Paotai Flour rose to 33-33.3 yuan, an increase of about 1 yuan from the previous day. Fushou Brand and Dangtian Brand were also priced at 32.4 yuan. In the evening market, it rose again to 32.7-32.8 yuan. About 30,000 bags were transacted.</p>
<p>There was no trading in wheat because the new wheat was subject to strict control and could not come to Shanghai, and the price in the mainland also increased with the price of Shanghai flour, making transportation even more difficult. Therefore, there was no import or export in the market, and it is feared that it will be difficult to develop for a while.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Corn, Soybean Oil, All Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes was dominated by the trend of the rice market, and prices rose again and again. General hoarding stomachs "grabbing hats, kicking the ball and bee" activities, corn prices fell by 1.6-1.7 yuan the day before, yesterday's market rebounded by 1.8 yuan, with more than 2,000 bags transacted. Saigon mixed new corn was priced from 25.5 yuan to 27 yuan, and all old corn from 25.5 yuan to 26 yuan, Dutch white corn from 28 yuan to 28.8 yuan, and yellow corn from 29 yuan to 30 yuan. There was no development in soybeans. Peanut oil and soybean oil rose again by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. The price of Dasu soybean oil was from 176.5 yuan to 179 yuan, with 150 barrels transacted. Hankou soybean oil was 80 barrels, priced at 178 yuan. Dayou Factory soybean oil was 200 dan, priced at 130 yuan, and Qingdao peanut oil was 30 barrels, priced at 182 yuan. Spot and futures prices for soybean cakes diverged. Spot cakes fell by 0.4-0.5 yuan due to sluggish sales, while futures prices rose along with other rising winds, resulting in an increase of 0.3-0.4 yuan from the previous day. Detailed prices are listed in the price column. The market will be closed for the summer break in the afternoon, which is scheduled from July 1 to August 15.</p>
<p>Exports on the 22nd: 870 bags of soybeans, shipped to Hong Kong; 7,440 pieces of soybean cakes, shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed rates for all currencies were flat. The black market for British and American exchange rates tightened first and then returned to flat, due to rumors that an American submarine had been sunk by the Germans. Chinese merchants and speculators came to strongly buy American dollars, softening them to 5.40625 yuan. British gold was also slightly higher, only 3 pence 3125, by the Guangdong merchants. Near noon, negative news suddenly emerged, and speculators turned to sell. Japanese banks also offered to sell, so the tightening trend returned to flat. Both exchange rates closed at the same price as the previous day. Trading was quite active in the morning, and speculators bought in tens of thousands of yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Fluctuates Uneasily; Spot Prices Also Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market fluctuated greatly in the black market, rising first and then suddenly falling. After breaking through the 6,400 yuan mark twice, it returned. People's minds changed from firm to tired. At noon, rumors suddenly arose that an American submarine had been sunk by the Germans. Therefore, although Finland mobilized and the tense atmosphere between Germany and the Soviet Union intensified, the foreign exchange returned from tight to half, and the buying interest of gold shops and Guangdong merchants weakened. Shanghai West Gang suddenly came out, so after the price rose to 6,413 yuan, it sharply retreated to 6,373 yuan before noon, and finally squeezed up a small three yuan. The transaction volume for half a day was 15,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and jewelry gold, etc., remained flat. Cash Mingyan was sold to Shunyuan for ten taels, and the price was 350 yuan higher than the futures transaction, squeezing past a slight drop. June futures rolled over to July, and the seller posted 55 yuan to the buyer.</p>
<p>Futures Suddenly Leak Near Noon</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 9:15 AM at 6,390 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan. It continued to rise slightly to 6,395 yuan. Shihe came to sell, and retailers sold small amounts to 6,382 yuan when they saw the high.

Hesheng, Yiyuan, Dafeng, Deda, and Xinyuan sold, and retreated to 6,388 yuan. When it was heard that the tension between Germany and the Soviet Union was tense, Hengji and Chengji vigorously bought, and the retailers raised the price sharply, and it was seen that it was raised to 6,413 yuan. Near noon, unfavorable rumors suddenly arose, and the price suddenly fell in the selling wind. Yida, Renchengyong, Xinfengyong, and Xinyuan poured out, and buyers waited and watched. The price gradually fell by 40 yuan, falling to 6,373 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,375 yuan, a small three yuan from the previous day.

<h3>Securities: Public Debt Buyers Emerge</h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds, although the rumors had no basis, was easily affected at high prices yesterday. Yesterday should have been optimistic, but some bulls emerged and sold. Although there were not many sales, the buyers felt discouraged and the market price showed a slight setback. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was held in the morning. At the opening at 11:00 AM, the opening price was slightly higher due to the continued demand from Xinfu, but Yichang and Lemao sold the most. Datong bought in, and Xiekang also sold out. The Class C two-yuan market went in and out several times, but it still broke the closing price. However, the trading volume was small and the fluctuations were limited. As a result, except for Class D, which was not traded, the rest were slightly lower by one to three jiao. The transaction volume was 1.2 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Long and Short Positions Change; Yarn Market Advances and Retreats Sharply; Highest Price Reaches 1544 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been declining for two consecutive days, presented a scene of sharp advance and retreat yesterday. This was due to the securities help in the air. At the same time, the Cantonese help made a large deal of more than 700 bags of 32-count Golden Rooster, 20-count Shepherd, and 10-count Red Double Horse yarn. As a result, people were encouraged, the market tightened, and the buying momentum was especially strong. 20-count Double Horse once rose to 1,544 yuan. The high price caused those who made a profit to sell out, falling back 20 yuan. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,544 yuan, and the low price was 1,525 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend, the transaction volume was scarce. At present, major players in the yarn market have mostly sold out their Double Horse factory orders, but outsiders have come to drag in, and the positions of the long and short sides have been reversed. The low price on May 27 was 1,372 yuan, and yesterday's peak has reached 1,544 yuan, an increase of 172 yuan. Today, 2,825 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with a tighter momentum, because the shorts were all filling in. The first board price was 1,525 yuan, with slight advances and retreats at 26-27 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,533-1,534 yuan. A part of the profit-takers sold out, falling back to 1,525 yuan. In an instant, it was said that gold had risen and Cantonese sales had not declined, and the buying momentum suddenly increased, rising again to 1,144 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 12:00, the margin suddenly fell, and people's minds relaxed. It suddenly fell to 1,525 yuan. The closing price was 1,526 yuan. The statistics for the transaction volume in half a day were 10,720 bags, including 720 bags from the Hong Kong gang and 10,000 bags of peer-to-peer ball business.</p>
<p>The market situation of Golden Double Horse standard yarn continued to advance due to short covering and bulls adding to their positions, so the market was tighter. The July period rose by 15 yuan, and the August period rose by 1.5 yuan, but after the close, the July period was weaker. It was found that the business of the exchange had been seen twice, so the transaction volume in half a day was very strong, with more than 10,000 bags. The high and low prices for half a day are recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Fine Velvet's Asking Price is Too High, Hindering Factory Sales</h3>
<p>The cotton situation is continuing to rise, with coarse velvet being the main transaction. Fine velvet, such as Meter Lin and Brazil Four Cotton, has become a scarce and expensive item, so the holders are hoarding goods severely, and the asking price is too high, which hinders consumption. It is difficult for factories to start, so the transaction volume is not as exciting as it used to be. However, the public is more willing to purchase raw materials for coarse velvet, and the price is relatively flat, so purchasing has been lively in recent days. The weekend transaction volume was 1,420 pieces and 180 bags, and the price rose by two or three yuan.</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower 230 Rongfeng 200 pieces sent to the factory</p>
<p>Huomu Jia 202 Hefeng 160 pieces sent to the factory</p>
<p>Meter Lin 475 Haojia 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Brazil Flower 436 Haojia 110 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Bailuo Qu 160 Haojia 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Yamla 223 Haojia 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Yamla 225 Haojia 250 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower 212 Haojia 300 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower 212 Haojia 300 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Huoji Flower 194 Haojia 180 bags delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton trading in Shanghai port: because the current yarn is soaring, and the foreign cotton market is rising again and again, and ordering is quite troublesome, the cotton market is still tight. Yesterday, in addition to Haojia's large transaction of Brazilian cotton, the factory's purchase intention was also strong, and there were also two or three batches of Argentine and Indian cotton transactions.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market, due to enthusiastic purchases by New Orleans and short covering, was lively and firm. Yesterday's purchase price rose by 5 to 11 pounds sound compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Another telegram: The US cotton statistics from August 1 last year to June 20 this year are recorded on the left (500 pounds per bag):</p>
<p>Cumulative listing: 2,616,000 bags</p>
<p>Cumulative factory use: 9,164,000 bags</p>
<p>Cumulative exports: 1,013,000 bags</p>
<p>To Japan: 31,000 bags</p>
<p>To China: 79,000 bags</p>
<p>To the United Kingdom: 37,000 bags</p>
<p>To Germany: 129,000 bags</p>
<p>To various port cities: 5,739,000 bags</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose first due to speculative purchases by traders and peers, and then fell slightly due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price rose by 2 to 8 rupees compared to the previous day. It is also predicted that the market will open high by one rupee today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Speculation is Frenzied; Short Covering and Hoarding Fly Together</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market yesterday rose sharply due to the eastern piece goods short covering, and people's minds were leaning upwards. Peers and hoarders searched for scattered cheap goods. Holders were watching with interest, and the factory prices also increased. Therefore, the selling prices of all cloths trended upwards uniformly. White goods, coarse and fine cloth twills each rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth increased by 5 jiao. The transaction volume was not strong. This street handled more than 200 pieces of grey cloth and bleached and dyed cloth, and the Yantai and Qingdao gangs on the north road handled more than 100 pieces of heavy and light coarse cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong khaki blue cloth handled more than 200 pieces, and the Nanyang gang handled more than 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth coarse cloth from Yihua, Lun Chang and other factories. Today, 1,314 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The rising trend of Eastern cloth continued to flourish, because the yarn price was high, and the real steel market expanded. Furthermore, the market was full of idle funds, and outside hoarders regarded cloth as cheap, and searched for large amounts of goods for several days. Each stall felt a shortage of spot goods, so white goods and fine cloth rose again by 7.5 to 9 jiao per piece, and fine twill rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao. The noon closing price of Longtou fine cloth factory's warehouse order was 47.15 yuan, and Longtou fine twill also raised the entire 43.75 yuan. The monthly futures cloth in the trading hall also continued to rise by 7-8 jiao. General shorts were busy covering, and they were not as powerful as before. Sèhuo Four Gentlemen Biji opened at 1.58 yuan in the morning, and once rose to 1.5925 yuan. In the middle, retailers sold for profit, returning to 1.57875 yuan. Finally, due to the depletion of warehouse order chips and outside purchases and hoarding, the closing price started at 1.59 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Relax Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned soft and relaxed slightly. The association divided the spot price of two-four coarse white foreign warehouse for June imports at 91 yuan, down 7 jiao, April imports at 88.6 yuan, March imports at 88.4 yuan, small triangular, January imports at 87.8 yuan, down 7 jiao. Taikoo's car white also relaxed with it, B mark at 105.6 jiao, small four jiao, HM mark at 75 yuan, down 5 jiao, and there was a lack of transactions for the rest.</p>
<h3>Cotton (5)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The earliest European use of cotton clothing can only be traced back to the twelfth century: that was the result of the Crusades, and this type of clothing was very highly valued. Later, as transportation became more frequent, the import of cotton fabrics to Western Europe naturally increased. And it seems that in the middle of the thirteenth century, Venetian workers were already able to imitate Eastern techniques and weave cotton cloth themselves: however, the cotton thread used was probably not spun by themselves but purchased from the East. France's initial use of cotton to manufacture goods can only be traced back to the sixteenth century: the establishment of woolen shops was in Rouen in 1534 and in Lyon in 1580. The cotton industries of England and the Netherlands also began at this time.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that when the Spanish conquered the New World in the sixteenth century, they saw Indians planting cotton very carefully and weaving cloth very skillfully everywhere from Mexico to Brazil, from the West Indies to Peru. These shallow conquerors, who may have only heard the name of cotton cloth before, were now dazzled by the value and ingenuity of this thing, and forced the Indians to act as permanent tribute products. One type of cotton, with long silky filaments, is now the most widely cultivated in various countries, which we call "American cotton"; some believe that its origin is Mexico, while others believe that this is just another branch of herbaceous cotton from the Old World; also, there are some varieties of cotton on the islands of Australia, which are scattered like weeds everywhere, how should this be explained? It is clear that we have again touched the thorny issue of the origin of plants and the origin of humans, which is chaotic and incomprehensible!</p>
<p>As for the United States, which now produces the most cotton in the world, the Spanish first tried planting cotton in its southeastern state of Florida in 1664; and it was not until 1784 that the first fourteen bales (264 catties per bale) of cotton were shipped to England; after five years, it had already become 130,000 bales; and by 1820, it had already increased to 600,000 bales... What about now...?</p>

<h3>Endorsement for Chairman Chiang is Growing, U.S. Aid to China Shows Increased Proactivity. Both Spiritual and Material Support Will Surely Have a Greater Impact in the Future. U.S. Planes in Chongqing Have Already Engaged in Combat with Japanese Aircraft.</h3>
<p>A mainland newspaper's editorial yesterday, titled "America Pays Tribute to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife," included the following translated excerpt: "This past Thursday, fifteen hundred American and Chinese officials, as well as leaders from the financial, cultural, and commercial sectors, held a grand banquet in New York City, New York, unanimously paying tribute to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife. The committee, chaired by Wendell Willkie, was warmly welcomed by all guests. Speakers included the Luce family. Mrs. Luce stated that, aside from President and Mrs. Roosevelt, Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek are truly the greatest figures in the world. This kind of praise is most significant."</p>
<p>American People's Sincere Affection</p>
<p>This kind of sincere affection undoubtedly demonstrates that, besides President and Mrs. Roosevelt, Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek are indeed the most admired figures by the American people. This is particularly fortunate for China, as the leader of their nation has earned the affection of the American people, and the spiritual and material assistance from the United States to China will surely have a greater impact.</p>
<p>Noble Character and Steadfast Composure</p>
<p>Considering the reasons why Chairman Chiang is so admired, there are several points that stand out. First, the top leader of China is seen by the American people as the symbol of the entire 450 million Chinese people resisting Japanese aggression. Second, Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek have fully demonstrated the spirit of Christianity in their endeavors, as religion has a great influence among millions of people in the United States. Therefore, the greatest reason for admiring Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek is their noble character. Chairman Chiang is able to deter the Japanese army's advance with steadfast composure and expose Japan's conspiracies against China, while Madame Chiang is able to assist him in the same manner. This spirit allows the American government and people to warmly sympathize with and understand Chairman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the entire Chinese people they lead, which is truly of great significance.</p>
<p>Japanese Acknowledge U.S. Planes in China</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that Japanese Army spokesman Colonel Akiyama, at a press conference yesterday (the 10th), mentioned reports of American pilots and aviation experts going to Chongqing to assist in operations against Japan, stating that the nationality of those fighting against Japan is not important, and they will be treated the same as Chinese officers. Japanese aircraft have already encountered American-made planes, but these planes are being flown by Chinese pilots. If they were piloted by American pilots, the Japanese would also welcome it, he said. In addition, a Japanese Navy spokesman stated that the Chinese army continues to lay floating mines in the Yangtze River, and four or five were discovered last week.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Employees to Receive Another Universal Allowance Increase. The Council Officially Announced the Increase Method Yesterday and Stipulated Implementation Starting from May.</h3>
<p>The Impact on Prices is Significant, Causing Widespread Public Anxiety.</p>
<p>The matter of the Shanghai Municipal Council employees universally receiving another salary increase, which has been under public scrutiny, was proposed by the Civil Service Commission. After a meeting last Thursday where a decision was postponed, almost two weeks have passed. People from all walks of life have been making urgent appeals, urging the authorities to consider the people's livelihoods and avoid stimulating price increases due to the further increase in salaries for Municipal Council employees, and to give the most careful consideration to the original proposal made by the Civil Service Commission. Although it was widely rumored that the proposal had been passed at the routine meeting convened by the Civil Service Commission on Monday evening, many people remained skeptical. They hoped that a final decision would be made at the regular meeting next Thursday. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Municipal Council officially released information yesterday, announcing the "Temporary Measures for Additional Living Cost Allowances for Employees," and stipulated that they would be implemented starting in May, without waiting for the formal passage at next week's regular meeting. This was quite unexpected. The measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Council Officially Announces Increased Cost of Living</p>
<p>According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, "Regarding the case of temporary living allowance for employees of this bureau, it has been carefully considered by the Civil Service Commission and the Board of Directors of this bureau. Since November of last year (i.e., the time of the last allowance increase), the cost of living in this port has increased by more than 40%. Therefore, this bureau has decided to issue temporary living allowance to employees from May 1st as follows:</p>
<p>Calculated by Grade Based on Original Salary</p>
<p>(1) For Chinese employees without employment contracts, an allowance of 185% will be issued for the first 200 yuan of their monthly salary, and an allowance of 150% will be issued for the portion beyond 200 yuan. The minimum allowance is set at 45 yuan per month. (2) For all employees with employment contracts, an allowance of 185% will be issued for the first 500 yuan of their monthly salary, an allowance of 150% will be issued for the second 500 yuan of their monthly salary, and an allowance of 120% will be issued for the portion exceeding 1,000 yuan. For "A" grade employees whose salary is one-third subject to exchange rate allowance, this allowance will be issued for two-thirds of their salary according to the above method.</p>
<p>Lower-Salaried Employees More Advantageous</p>
<p>As a result of this additional allowance, the compensation obtained by general "B" and "C" grade employees with lower salaries due to the aforementioned high cost of living is approximately 13%. At the same time, the compensation obtained by employees with larger salaries is relatively smaller.</p>
<p>Stipulated to Take Effect from May</p>
<p>The aforementioned measures are temporary measures to show consideration for employees. As for more permanent measures for adjusting employee salaries on a regular basis, they are pending consideration and adoption by this bureau. Any measures, once approved, will take effect from May 1st."</p>
<p>Far-Reaching Implications</p>
<p>Well-informed sources pointed out yesterday that the repeated universal salary increase for Municipal Council employees may have two impacts: (1) The salaries of Municipal Council employees are usually the standard for salaries of employees in other industries. After Municipal Council employees received a universal living allowance last November, salaries in various industries also tended to rise accordingly. This decision to increase salaries again will inevitably cause salaries in various industries to fluctuate. Although the increase in Municipal Council employees' salaries is said to be due to a 40% increase in prices, many believe that there is no reason to be the same as the previous salary increase. Therefore, this repeated salary increase will cause salaries in other industries to increase as well, further raising prices and causing people throughout the city to experience the difficulty of making a living. This is one. (2) If the economic situation of the Municipal Council is difficult to sustain the repeated increase in employee salaries, then it can only be compensated by increasing taxes or borrowing. If taxes are increased, the new land regulations supplementary rule 52, paragraph 3, "If the decision of the Municipal Council or the Board of Appeal becomes the final decision and has legal effect, the Municipal Council may implement this decision and collect taxes in accordance with Articles 10 and 20 of the Land Regulations." The Shanghai Municipal Council's authority to levy taxes has been expanded. In order to cope with extraordinary needs, the Municipal Council may levy taxes based on the expanded authority, and the consequences are self-evident.</p>
<p>Public Bus Fares Increase Again</p>
<p>Also, regarding the British-owned public bus company's plan to increase fares by another 51% starting July 1, it is widely believed that it has been fully approved after the meeting of the Public Utilities Committee this Thursday. However, the Council postponed the decision at the meeting last Thursday, but it has now been re-approved by the Public Utilities Committee, so it is bound to be approved and implemented by the Council. This is especially evident after the Municipal Council announced another increase in living allowances yesterday. The announcement date does not have to wait until after the meeting of the Board of Directors next Thursday, and may be seen in fact within two or three days. However, the general public has always opposed the increase in public utility fees, as it directly affects the livelihoods of everyone. The Shanghai Municipal Council has no reason to approve the repeated increase in fares for public buses or trolleys, as it only gives the company an opportunity to earn more profits.</p>
<h3>Lei Xiong Acting as Regiment Commander of the Isolated Army</h3>
<p>Xie Jinyuan, the regiment commander of the Isolated Army on Singapore Road, was fatally stabbed by disloyal soldiers Hao Jingcheng and others in a mutiny on the morning of April 24th while personally leading soldiers in morning exercises. People in China and abroad were shocked and saddened by this. All the perpetrators have been brought to trial by the First Special District Court, and a verdict will be announced soon. As for the vacancy left by the late Commander Xie, it is heard that the Military Affairs Commission has decided to appoint Lei Xiong, the regimental adjutant of the regiment, to act as regiment commander.</p>
<h3>Changes in Airmail Postage Rates</h3>
<p>Postal Bureau Notice: Regarding the airmail postage rates for newspapers, printed matter, documents for the blind, trade contracts, samples, business brochures, and small packages exchanged domestically, which will be uniformly changed to 2.5 jiao in national currency per ten grams starting June 20th of this year, the Bureau has already notified everyone in Notice No. 1671 on the 17th of this month. Now, it is found that these newly established airmail rates refer to the aforementioned items of mail to and from the bureaus in the southwest and northwest regions. Those exchanged within the occupied areas and transported by Japanese aircraft will still be charged airmail postage rates as usual (see Notice No. 1661 of this Bureau on April 15th of this year), and there will be no changes. This notice is urgently issued to inform everyone. This notice.</p>

<h3>Fundamental Solution to Eliminate Black Market Exchange Rates: Unified Circulation of Chips. No Discrimination Between Cash, Checking, and Transfer Payments. The Public Draft System is Being Researched for Reform.</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Trades Association has recently received suggestions from banking employees that the chips circulating in Shanghai are divided into "cash," "checking," and "transfer," but in fact, they are all national currency. This has resulted in abnormal situations of black market exchange rates, and speculators take the opportunity to profit from it. This has hindered social finance. The suggestion is that there should be no difference between these</p>
<p>Three Types of Chips</p>
<p>and that it will be submitted to a joint meeting of the two trade associations to study how to unify the circulation of chips, with the aim of facilitating all industries, eliminating speculation, and stabilizing finance. Once a specific plan has been discussed, it will be publicly announced and implemented. Regarding the black market exchange rate for transfers, the Ministry of Finance has long ordered its abolition. The black market exchange rate for checking has been addressed by the Banking Joint Reserve Association. Both black market exchange rates are prohibited by law. Bank deposit slips that specify cash, checking, or transfer should also be abolished to avoid affecting people's minds. In addition, the Money Trades Association is researching the</p>
<p>Public Draft Issue</p>
<p>And has proposed four opinions, forming a Public Draft Issue Research Committee, with two representatives from the Money Trades Reserve and seven representatives from various firms as members. It is hoped that various firms will submit as many opinions as possible for discussion. The four opinions are recorded below: (1) It is proposed to continue using the public draft reporting form for clearing, which should be submitted by each firm to the money reserve after the figures have been verified. (2) Specify the time for receiving drafts, restore the public draft system and improve it. (3) Adopt the clearing method of the clearing house. (4) Extend the clearing time by half an hour, mutually check the figures, and each firm opens a public draft. It is heard that the Silver and Money Trades Association has</p>
<p>Decided on Closing Holiday</p>
<p>And has recently announced: (1) Banks will have a holiday on July 1st and 2nd for the semi-annual settlement as usual. (2) Money trades will have a two-day holiday on July 1st and 2nd for the semi-annual settlement. (3) Various industries in the market, such as foreign exchange, gold, cotton yarn, beans, rice, grains, securities, hardware, cotton cloth, and coal, have decided to close the market for two days on July 1st and 2nd to handle the semi-annual settlement, and will resume business simultaneously with the silver and money trades on the 3rd. It is also heard that the Silver and Money Trades Reserve, the Money Trades Market Clearing House, and the Draft Acceptance Center will be closed on July 1st and 2nd.</p>
<h3>Da Cheng Steamer Detained</h3>
<p>The British-owned Da Cheng steamer, which was test-sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou, has reportedly been detained by Japanese warships anchored in the Zhejiang Sea while en route. The location of the detention is said to be either in the waters off Putuo Mountain or off Zhoushan. The actual situation has not yet been reported. It is understood that since this was a test sailing, no cargo was loaded, but there were many passengers. The company is working to transport the passengers back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>After Report That U.S. Ships Have Been Requisitioned, Two Ships to Be Dispatched First to Take Over the Route. Limited Tonnage May Not Fully Accommodate Passengers. Shipping Industry Suggests Expanding Cabin Space.</h3>
<p>Seven mail ships owned by the U.S. President Lines, including the President Coolidge, which sail on the Pacific route and the world itinerary, have been requisitioned by the U.S. government to undertake transportation duties and are about to return to the United States to gather</p>
<p>And await orders.</p>
<p>According to sources from the local U.S. mail ship company yesterday, after the President Coolidge and other 535.S. (class) ships are requisitioned and suspended, the C.3 class (i.e., the recently round-the-world itinerary ships) and the 502, 'S. President, Fillmore two sister ships will take over the route first, and the schedule will be decided soon. However, since the two sister ships are too old, they may not fully accommodate passengers. It is also said that these ships</p>
<p>Only Have First Class</p>
<p>cabins. Although the fares are slightly lower than the 535.'S (class) ships, since this year's Chinese students studying in the United States (estimated at more than one hundred and fifty people) urgently need to go to the United States, they will be the first to continue the route. However, they feel that the fares of these two ships are too expensive. The company has now received suggestions from the shipping industry, so when these two ships regularly sail to the Far East, they may add second and third class cabins to meet the needs of general passengers. As for other replacement ships to continue the route, they are currently being considered.</p>
<p>Smooth Sailing</p>
<p>Beside the pond in the French Garden, there are often many children holding model sailboats, putting them on the water, and letting them float slowly with a gentle breeze. There are no raging waves here, making it a veritable "Little Pacific." (Photo by Kang Zuyi)</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Wishing You a Limitless Future</h3>
<p>Dear elementary school graduates!</p>
<p>You must be busy with your graduation exams these days! In this great era, most children across the country are out of school. You are so fortunate to be able to complete your studies and graduate from elementary school! It's a truly fortunate event, worthy of celebration!</p>
<p>But, are you content with just graduating from elementary school? No, certainly not! Graduation merely signifies the completion of one stage. After elementary school, there's middle school, and after middle school, there's university. The path ahead is limitless! As the saying goes: "Learning knows no bounds, learning has no end." "You can learn until you're old, and still not learn everything." How can you be complacent after graduating from elementary school and stop progressing?</p>
<p>Therefore, for those of you planning to continue your education, selecting a school should be done with great care. "A miss of an inch leads to a loss of a mile." You'll suffer immense losses if you're not careful. As for those entering school, it goes without saying that you should strive to learn and strengthen your bodies. China is in the midst of hardship, and it awaits each of you to take on the great responsibility of building the nation in the future.</p>
<p>Even for those of you who are not continuing your education, don't cut off your path to knowledge. Acquiring knowledge and skills doesn't solely rely on education from schools. As long as you are willing to work hard and strive for improvement, you can still succeed. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, many successful people have come from struggling and striving. I hope you too will temper yourselves in hardship, enrich yourselves, and be able to stand on your own in society and serve your country in the future.</p>
<p>Children, work hard! Move forward! Wishing you a limitless future!</p>
<h3>Children's Lives in Wartime Countries</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>When a country is at war, the lives of its people are inevitably affected. Children, being a part of the population, will naturally experience a different life than in peacetime. Here's a look at the lives of children in various countries during wartime:</p>
<p>Germany: Germany has always placed great emphasis on the training of children, especially after the outbreak of war. All children in Germany, from the age of eight to under fourteen, are forced to undergo preliminary military training. Those over the age of fourteen join the Hitler Youth and receive advanced military training. Once they reach adulthood, they can enlist in the army.</p>
<p>Italy: Under Mussolini's rule, Italy has the "Wolf Cub" organization, divided into junior and senior levels, engaged in military training. Since the outbreak of war, this training has been intensified. Furthermore, members of the Wolf Cub, around the age of fifteen, have joined the wartime service corps, taking on tasks such as air raid defense and first aid, with considerable success.</p>
<p>England: After the war broke out in England, children in major cities were evacuated to the countryside, causing significant changes in their lives. Although they can still attend school in the countryside, the material comforts are far less than in the cities. However, even now, you can still see children playing in the parks of London, indicating that not all children have been evacuated.</p>
<p>Other: Although the United States has not yet joined the war, the children in the United States have developed a considerable interest in war due to the intense atmosphere of domestic competition. What they talk about and study are all related to military affairs and war. As for the Soviet Union, like the United States, it has not yet joined the war. However, Soviet children, who have always enjoyed studying crafts, are now paying even more attention to this aspect, hoping to make inventions that will enhance national defense in the future. It shows that Soviet children are not only able to endure hardship but also have great ambitions.</p>
<h3>Chatting About the North Pole</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiaju</p>
<p>Dear children! We once learned in geography class that the North Pole is a place of snow and ice. There, everything on the ground is covered by dazzling ice blocks, forming a boundless ice sheet. The harsh climate and scarcity of resources make even the Eskimos, who are famous for living in cold climates near the Arctic, reluctant to live there.</p>
<p>Therefore, until recently, the North Pole, where one year is like one day, half the year is day, and half is night, was a mystery to people. We imagined that in such a harsh place, how could there be any living beings? However, after continuous exploration and failures, scientific progress has finally allowed humans to conquer the North Pole and reveal its secrets.</p>
<p>In July 1937, Soviet scientists landed on the ice floes of the North Pole by plane. They brought many complete instruments and ample food to conduct scientific research. They stayed there for several months, drifting for many miles during this period, experiencing months of darkness and long days. As a result, they brought us a lot of new knowledge. The following are their findings:</p>
<p>Many living beings exist in the North Pole. Polar bears and seals live in groups on the ice sheet, and seagulls and other birds fly in the sky. There are many small creatures in the water under three or four meters of ice. All this is contrary to our imagination.</p>
<p>Previous books often said that there are five oceans and five continents on Earth. This statement was originally correct, but now the facts prove that although the Arctic is an ocean, the Antarctic is a continent. This is also one of the gains of Arctic exploration.</p>
<p>The Arctic Ocean can also be used. Now the Soviet Union is actively carrying out long-term navigation between its Far Eastern border and its European part. Weather stations can be built on the ice floes to provide weather information to airplanes and ships, ensuring their safety.</p>
<p>The development of the Arctic and Antarctic is just beginning. In the future, we will definitely be able to get more new knowledge about this from the newspapers.</p>
<h3>Children and Hobbies</h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>I believe every child understands the meaning of the word "hobby." However, there is a distinction between good and bad hobbies, and I'm afraid many children are unclear about this distinction. Everyone should have a hobby. After a day of work, a person can use their hobby to regulate their spirit. If a student focuses solely on studying and doesn't know any proper ways to relax, the result will definitely be tragic. The greatest significance of a hobby is to help our lives enter the realm of success.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the hobbies of general children. In the neighborhood where I live, there is a child around ten years old. Recently, he managed to save about ten yuan, which is not easy. But he used this money to buy a pair of ice skates, because he has a hobby of skating. There is also a son of one of my friends. His parents give him four yuan a month for pocket money. This child doesn't eat snacks or read books, but because he admires the heroes in foreign movies, he often asks his parents for money before the end of the month.</p>
<p>The two examples above are not too bad. If it is a bad hobby, it will not only not be of any benefit to us, but also cause losses in terms of money, time, and spirit. Dear children! Money, time, and spirit are your three most precious things. So, from today onwards, you should pay attention to your own hobbies, and especially not indulge in bad hobbies, because this will hinder your future!</p>
<h3>How to Make Your Own Envelopes</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>Dear children, don't you often write letters to your classmates and friends? Students who live in dormitories also have to write letters to their parents. But in this era of expensive rice and firewood, the prices of all kinds of goods are soaring, and even envelopes made of rough paper cost five or six jiao per bundle. Since they are so expensive, we might as well make a few ourselves to save a few jiao. How do we do it?</p>
<p>First, tear off the cover of a used foreign notebook, and use the blank side as the front. As for the inside, even if it has writing, it doesn't matter. Then, imitate the shape of an envelope and cut it out with scissors. After cutting it out, paste it with glue, and you have a money-saving and elegant envelope! Wouldn't it be great to send it out?</p>
<p>Children, why not give it a try?</p>
<h3>Common Things in Hot Weather (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>Last Sunday, A-Liang's father was in the middle of an engaging story when his mother interrupted their conversation. So, this Sunday, A-Liang specifically asked his father to continue the story and didn't go out to play. Even when the children from the neighborhood came to ask him to play, he declined, saying he was busy. Seeing that A-Liang was listening so attentively, his father was motivated to continue.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll tell you about something else! In the summer, there are many brief showers. One moment it's sunny, the next it's raining. Therefore, there is especially a lot of rain. So, why are there so many brief showers in the summer? You need to know that summer in Shanghai is already very hot, but the inland areas are even hotter than Shanghai. This is because Shanghai has the advantage of being on the coast. So, in the summer, differences in air temperature between different regions are common. When the difference is too great, the air will move rapidly, which is what we call a brief gust of wind. This wind brings the rain clouds over, thus causing a brief shower. However, brief showers don't last long, because the air is constantly moving, and soon the clouds are blown away. The rain naturally stops, and the sun shines through. So, there is a saying: 'A brief shower scares the little devils,' which describes how short brief showers are. Right after the rain, the sun comes out, forming a colorful rainbow in the sky. I remember Grandma telling us: 'You can't point at a rainbow, or your finger will rot.' You need to know that a rainbow is sunlight shining on the fine raindrops in the air. The light is refracted by the raindrops and divided into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, which are arranged in the sky, creating a rainbow. The saying that if you point at it, your finger will rot, is really the most unreasonable superstition. If your classmates still believe this saying, you can try showing them what happens when there is a rainbow. Will your finger rot? I guarantee that you won't rot your finger. This will break their superstitious beliefs, and you will have done something quite meaningful. In the summer, there is also a lot of thunder. Suddenly, dark clouds gather, lightning flashes, and thunder roars. Then, a gust of wind blows, and a torrential rain pours down. So, there is a saying: 'Thunder urges thunder, thunder urges wind, wind urges rain,' which is very accurate. I remember Grandma always talked about dragons taking water during thunderstorms. Are there really dragons in the sky? Do dragons really take water? In fact, the so-called dragons taking water is not dragons taking water, but the wind is taking the place of the dragons taking water. Have you ever seen a whirlwind? This is common on land. When a small whirlwind starts, the scraps of paper and dust on the ground are swirled up by the whirlwind. If the whirlwind is large, it will often lift the scraps of paper, etc., up into the air. And dragons taking water is the large whirlwind that appears in rivers and seas, swirling the water in the rivers and seas upwards, just like the small whirlwind on land swirling up scraps of paper and dust. However, the force of the whirlwind in the rivers and seas is exceptionally strong. Sometimes, in the water column swirled up by the whirlwind, you can see golden dragon scales. Some people then determine that this is evidence of dragons taking water. In fact, these golden dragon scales are the sunlight reflected on the water column. So, the matter of dragons taking water is also a misunderstanding by people. And dragons may have existed in ancient times, but dragons can be said to have disappeared by now." A-Liang listened with unblinking eyes, as if he were mesmerized.</p>
<h3>Several Strange Fish</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Archerfish: Archerfish are a type of strange fish found in the fresh water of the South Seas. They resemble our common mandarin fish in shape, with a large mouth and a short body. They can shoot water bullets from their mouths to knock down insects on the surface of the water for food, shooting as if anti-aircraft guns are shooting down airplanes.</p>
<p>Climbing Perch: Climbing perch live in the fresh water of Malaysia. Their bodies are flat and about seven inches long. They can climb onto land. When climbing, they use the spines of their anal and ventral fins to push themselves forward, as if using their feet. After climbing onto land, they do not use gills to breathe. The head has a special structure to replace the gills for breathing, and they can climb trees to eat dew and insects on the leaves of the trees.</p>
<p>Electric Ray: The electric ray is one of more than fifty species of electric fish. It is very fierce in the sea and can generate electricity from its ingenious prism-shaped organs. When hunting fish, it emits electricity from its body. Fish that touch the electricity immediately become unconscious and are swallowed in one bite. Furthermore, its electricity can produce real sparks.</p>

<h3>The Root Cause of Yan Hua and Zhou Xuan's Marital Crisis</h3>
<p>— A'mei</p>
<p>Movie star Zhou Xuan and her husband Yan Hua have been arguing fiercely for the past few days, and the situation has reached a rather serious stage. This magazine has reported on it twice, and the two parties' advertisements have also appeared in this newspaper yesterday and the day before yesterday, with one refuting and one replying, making quite a noisy commotion. From the advertisements, it can be seen that both parties only mentioned the process and did not reach the point of breaking up. Judging from this, there are still some twists and turns before they can be said to be reconciled. The writer has obtained the cause of this matter from another source. If it is true, then they will not reach the step of divorce. I am now writing this at the end. If it is true, I hope that they will abandon their prejudices and restore their relationship to its original state.</p>
<p>The course of an event often has many twists and turns. In the process of twists and turns, being able to recognize the reasoning will always achieve its purpose. The current situation of Yan and Zhou is tense due to this twisted process. They have now made things difficult. According to the news obtained by the writer, I dare not recklessly judge Yan Hua's attitude towards Zhou Xuan on weekdays, but when Zhou Xuan resolutely decided to ask lawyer Li Weibin to file a divorce request, crystalline tears involuntarily fell from her haggard face, and there must have been considerable pain in her heart. However, after living together for nine years, divorce in one day, not to mention the external</p>

<h3>Why Divorce?</h3>
<p>— Yuan Xuefen</p>
<p>Dragon and phoenix candles illuminate the newlyweds,</p>
<p>Music plays as they tie the knot,</p>
<p>Talented man and beautiful woman, everyone praises,</p>
<p>Husband and wife live in harmony.</p>
<p>Being able to marry in this life,</p>
<p>Is due to a predestined fate from a previous life,</p>
<p>If the marriage is destined, it will come true even if it is far away,</p>
<p>If it is not destined, it will not meet even if it is near.</p>
<p>Just think, there are hundreds of millions of men and women in the world,</p>
<p>Why did the two of us get married?</p>
<p>In the dead of night when everyone is quiet,</p>
<p>Everyone touches their own heart.</p>
<p>Have I treated him unfairly?</p>
<p>Compare your heart to his heart.</p>
<p>Always think one step back,</p>
<p>Contentment brings true happiness.</p>
<p>If the other person has shortcomings,</p>
<p>Advise them softly,</p>
<p>Once, twice, even three times,</p>
<p>The other person will definitely not be heartless.</p>
<p>A hundred nights of love for a night of marriage,</p>
<p>The love between husband and wife is as deep as the sea.</p>
<p>Moreover, you have been married for several years,</p>
<p>There is always love between husband and wife.</p>
<p>It must be because of trivial matters,</p>
<p>That storms arise in the family.</p>
<p>Fighting and scolding,</p>
<p>Then hiring a lawyer to handle the divorce.</p>
<p>Knowing that you would divorce today, why did you get married in the first place?</p>
<p>Divorcing him today,</p>
<p>And marrying another tomorrow,</p>
<p>Getting married and divorced is unclear,</p>
<p>Lawyers are just doing business.</p>
<p>Life is originally a play,</p>
<p>With its own joys and sorrows, separations and reunions.</p>
<p>Seeing a comedy, people laugh,</p>
<p>Seeing a tragedy, tears fall.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes for a happy ending,</p>
<p>A broken mirror reunited is truly joyful.</p>
<p>Let's not keep the past in mind,</p>
<p>From now on, husband and wife should make up and live again.</p>
<p>The past is like yesterday,</p>
<p>The future begins today,</p>
<p>Be good husband and wife,</p>
<p>And live happily ever after.</p>
<p>Husband and wife live in harmony,</p>
<p>And grow old together without separation.</p>
<p>(But) how is reputation damaged, putting aside considerations of the object of human emotion, is not Zhou Xuan's wish. However, why did she entrust a lawyer to send a letter mentioning the words "divorce"? It is said that the initial motive and hope were nothing more than to prompt Yan Hua to improve his treatment. Moreover, once the incident occurred, relatives and friends would surely come to persuade, and then it could be resolved peacefully. Unexpectedly, it became serious after Zhou Xuan left in anger, and he used advertisements to warn her. In this way, everyone knew about it, the situation expanded, and face was at stake, so it was difficult to clean up. Therefore, in the first conversation between the two parties at Liu Zhonghao's home, the focus was on questioning Yan Hua why he published in the newspaper. Yan Xiao understood her intention and did not euphemistically explain it and properly seek a remedy, resulting in a stalemate. If Yan Hua had not publicly published in the newspaper at the beginning, but after receiving the lawyer's letter, he had asked relatives and friends to persuade her with kind words, giving her a guarantee not to take surveillance attitudes or scold and beat her randomly, perhaps Zhou Xuan could have understood and there would have been no unexpected outcome. Moreover, they have loved each other for nine years, and Zhou has no other lover. Even the law would be difficult to constitute the reason for Article 1052 of the Civil Code. Although the situation is about to reach the extreme, in fact Yan Hua does not want a divorce, and how can Zhou Xuan have the intention to divorce? It is hoped that Yan Jun will refer to the above opinions and deal with them sincerely, and a satisfactory result will be obtained. The reporter has a slight intention for the sake of protecting both parties. I wonder what both parties think?</p>

<h3>Blood Rain, Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Heroic Demeanor Comes to Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Because Xu Jing was guarding a village at the Pubo Estuary, a scout at the Ye Niu River spotted bandits secretly building a pontoon bridge across the river for a sneak crossing. He hurriedly reported to Xu Jing. Xu Jing dared not delay and quickly led two hundred cavalrymen to the riverbank. In the darkness, they shot arrows towards the pontoon bridge being built in the river. Many bandits were shot and fell into the water. However, many small boats had already approached the riverbank, and the bandits braved the rain of arrows, bravely charging ashore. Xu Jing led his troops to meet them, but unfortunately, his subordinates were too few, and the bandits kept crossing the river in an endless stream. Xu Jing sent someone to Wang Yongtai to beg for reinforcements while fighting the bandits with all his might. After a long melee, most of the two hundred cavalrymen were killed or wounded, and the bandits in the river surged up like a tide. Fearing that they would be surrounded and unable to escape, he quickly broke through the encirclement and rushed to Wang Yongtai to report the alarm, wanting to discuss how to resist. But who knew that Li Zicheng's main force of bandits had already secretly crossed the river to the west of Wang Yongtai, and were ambushing them? Torches shone brightly, like several fire dragons leaping in the wilderness, with shouts like thunder, their momentum extremely arrogant. Wang Yongtai did not have time to say anything more to Xu Jing. Everyone raised their weapons and directed the government troops to kill towards the fire. The lieutenant of this bandit force was Luo, known as "One-Eyed Tiger," a favorite and brave general of Li Zicheng. He was exceptionally brave, always charging ahead in every battle, riding a lowly horse, wielding a broadsword, and naked from the waist up, rushing towards the front of the government army's camp. His soldiers were also seasoned veterans, the elite of Li Zicheng's forces. Wang Yongtai met him head-on. One-Eyed Tiger's broadsword slashed fiercely at his horse's head, with the force of a whirlwind and torrential rain. Wang Yongtai's serpent spear was barely able to suppress him, and the two fought fiercely for fifty or sixty rounds. Wang Yongtai saw that One-Eyed Tiger was indeed brave and could not be underestimated. One-Eyed Tiger also felt that this old general's skill was extraordinary and fought with all his strength. Xu Jing, fearing that Wang Yongtai would be at a disadvantage, charged forward on his horse with his spear to assist in the battle. The bandits had already surrounded their team in a large circle. At the same time, the bandits by the river seized the opportunity to cross the river and joined forces with the team of bandits at Chenjiadu, attacking the government troops from all sides. With seven or eight thousand men from three directions, how could Wang Yongtai's isolated army withstand them? The casualties among his subordinates gradually increased, and the camps were all broken through by the bandits, who set fires, burning everything red.</p>
