<h3>擇校難升學亦難</h3>
<p>求學誠難事，不難於讀書，而難於擇校。學校良，雖不肯而化爲賢良，不良，雖智慧而同甘墮落，此雖非不刊之論，要爲事實所恒有。蓋靑年大部分時間，化之於學校，與師友盤桓之時間長，與家庭叙晤之時間少，故家庭教育雖重要，而學校教育尤重要。今爲時局所迫，環境所限，東南學府，內徒而外，集中於滬濱。滬上本非莘莘學子進德修業之所，聲色犬馬之好，貨利狼豕之逐，在在足以影響及於靑年之意志，而使之或左或右，或高或卑。意志之不定，即學業無由於專一，不專一，則其所成就也可知。然如學校能矯時俗之弊，示靑年以爲人處世之道，亦未始不可收效；而無如學程愈高，往往與社會同化之程度愈深，可知縱有善良風化，嚴格訓教，尚不敵習俗傳染之易。若果等而下之，則非踐履篤實，意志堅强，卓爾不羣，鮮不爲所同化於無形。古有言：「貧不學儉，富不學奢」，蓋謂爲事實所當然，無所用其學。而今日通病，正爲國難如斯，民窮若彼，猶是宴安鴆毒，逸豫盤遊，貧學奢，富益侈，遂致不乏貴族化之學校，與資本色彩濃厚之師生，是誠求學之大患。夫靑年性本純潔，而習俗薰染，有所不免，近朱近墨，五入五變，氣質變化之易也如此。故交游而爲直諒多聞，則樂多賢友；所侶而爲便辟柔侫，則驕佚宴樂。爲之師者，固在樂得天下英才而教育之；爲之學子者，亦在求名師良友之教益，而收陶冶化育之功。昔馬援語光武，「當今之世，非獨君擇臣，臣亦擇君。」竊意今之求學，非獨學校擇學生，學生亦須擇校而就學，然而學校之擇學生易，學生之擇學校民則難。</p>
<p>蓋學生固有擇校而思往學之志矣！中須經入學之試騐，取與不取，孰能預定。夫考試之制，爲中國古來之舊法，而科舉之廢，非獨爲其文，亦爲其憑一日之短長，所取未必皆賢，所學未必皆實，復有關節請託之弊。雖犯科舉則例者，有嚴刑峻法作制裁，然弊終不絕，有聲勢者仍易爲進，故爲談新學者所攻擊。今之學校升學試騐，能不有透露題旨於其所素識與吾？能憑試卷成績作取舍，有不受請託而暗中融通者否？能平心靜氣閱試卷，銖兩悉稱，不爲意氣所支使吾？論理固不須有此盧，有之，是直以試騐爲點綴門面，蹈科舉之惡習，決非目下尚實之學校所宜出此。惟是各校之升學試驗，其取錄之標準，大有寬嚴之殊，寬則試題淺易，取錄較廣，有待其入校就學之後，視其程度優劣，遂級淘汰者。亦有以學生多多益善，凡勉强可認而及格者，兼收並蓄，一榜盡及第者有之，此則失之於濫，濫則學生程度，參差不齊，不易獲得相當之水準，轉非所以爲學之道。嚴則故意從試題上弄狡獪，明明所習爲白話文，而試之以文言文。明知其爲非必要之學科，而必以必要之科目考試之。四書五經不與讀，而命題乃在四書五經之中。成語之標準最難定，且多識成語有何益，而必試之以成語，查究其出處，此無異藉詩謎作博具而對證古本者乎？測騐題目甚廣泛，而故促其時間以困之。數理縱艱奧，乃有一題之解答，非片楮所能盡，竟有不能終試之嘆。此皆非考試之正規。蓋試驗之方，故意寬可不必，故意嚴更不可，要以受試者所習程度爲依據。如受試於初中者，必以一般所習之高小課本作命題之範圍。所投考於大學者，必以一般高中所應具之學術，爲試驗之準則。若所試非所習，或超出於所應有程度之外，是則非以相試，實以留難，豈考試之本意。至以試題艱奧怪僻，而自高其學校聲價，所見更左矣。</p>
<p>擇校難，升學亦難，然非爲升學試驗不售之學生，作卸責之地步。人果有志於學問，無時無地不可以爲學，終有成就之一日。不志於學，雖入大學，負笈涉重洋，亦無裨實際。故事在人爲，學貴自求；若學業未精，用力不專，而怨天尤人，則大謬矣！</p>

<p>合衆社二十日華盛頓電雖軸心國封閉歐洲德佔領區及義大利各處美使館之要求、直至昨晚夜半、始抵國務部、然今日侵晨、美國始表示有尤諾之意、因美國業要求德國封閉所有在美之領館、此間相信、美國對軸心國之答覆、必爲要求義國封閉所有在美之意領館、義國在美之領館、已有若干所、於數日前被命令封閉、美國在德國義國及德義佔領區、共有領館一百零三所、然其中若干所、則係兼具領事及外交兩種職務、或不致受軸心要求之影響，設美國命令義國封閉所有領館、則義國將爲一損失者、因義在美有領館四十丸所、而美在義則僅領館七所、封閉領館後之德美外交關係、將不絕如縷、因屆時彼此均僅存一大使館矣、大部分國際問題專家、鑒於德美兩國之敵對情態、迅速發展、竟連此後兩國最低限度之外交關係、是吾能維持、亦起懷疑、華盛頓與柏林未互派大使、已有兩年、彼此之大使館、均係田外交代辦中持、美國在要求德國封閉領館以前、早已料及德國必報復、故德國此舉、在美實無足驚異、今美德之外交抵觸、已僅具一空泛之形式、而許多人士並對兩國之外交破裂、究在何時發生、亦起揣測、據接近政府之消息靈通方面、則以爲羅總統於美德絕交、決不爲主動、其理由有二、（一）羅總統希望德元首先對美絕交、係因德國此舉、可使美國人民、認識德國已在與美爲敵、從而可以促成總統刺激民衆、準備對德採取强烈步驟意願之實現、（二）總統所以希望德國首先破臉、係因德此舉、足以影響日本、主張此說者之理由、係謂德若採主動步驟、對美作戰、日本或不致被其軸心國諾言所拘束、而援助德國、若美爲主動、則日本將認美國爲攻擊其友邦之國家云、</p>

<p>合衆社二十日紐約電　政局研究者昨細察歐亞兩洲所謠傳之德蘇兩國關係、究竟有無開戰之可能、咸認此種猜測尚須予以重大保留、現時殊無作堅確判斷之可能、已往一星期間所傳訊息、計有（一）倫敦期望德土簽的條的後、德蘇關係或將於數日內達於危急點、（二）據報芬京希爾新基之居民已撤退預防戰事、（三）挑出檢查網之羅馬尼亞消息稱、德軍在羅境正設立一强大之根據地、似係準備武力解決蘇聯之用，（四）土京安加拉報告、德國在蘇邊集中軍隊一百五十萬人、（五）央國非官方猜想英空軍雖猛炸德國各地、而八日來德機未曾炸英、似係德國集中力量擬對蘇大舉、</p>

<p>合衆社二十日倫教電　可靠英方外交人士昨日獲得德國已對莫斯科致送主要「建議」或要求之情報、惟此項情報未經證實、此項「建議」（或竟稱要求）包括（一）大量增加蘇油及麥之輸德、（二）尤許德國在蘇聯　口包括里波·里加·及塔林在內、設立德國海軍根據地、尤其成立潛艇根據地及船塢、因其他德國波羅的海船塢過於暴露於英國空軍之前、（三）蘇聯尤許德軍進駐貝薩村比亞之陸空根據地、以監視上述二要求之實踐、此輩雖發出此項消息、惟認德蘇戰爭或可避免、彼等相信斯達林不久即將大事讓步、與德訂立新協定、同時自挪威抵倫敦之可靠消息稱、德軍正用可微用之船隻、沿挪威四岸運兵至扣基尼亞斯附近、此舉乃德方大量增加集中挪威之兵額、與增兵芬蘭相同、此頃行　之目　、衆信係一俟戰事展開、德軍即可突攻茂曼斯克及阿克安琪爾云、</p>

<h3>德土訂友好條約　蘇聯並無反響　土聲明仍視英爲盟友　衆認爲近東安定因素</h3>
<p>路透社二十日莫斯科電　此間對於土德締結友好條的事、尚未見有反響、蘇土兩國會於一九二五年締結互不侵犯公的、維持兩國關係、此的於一九二九年續訂並予擴大、兩國政府交換之文告已於本年三月二十五日公布、</p>
<p>路透社二十日土京電　德土條的簽訂後、土國各方俱以「我土人決不赴維也納」爲言、且切欲間明土國仍爲英國之友國盟邦、鑒於地理上與軍事上現局今在德軍已近土國邊陲之時、訂此新的、顯有利於土國、蓋土國仍抱非交戰國之政策、對任何國家均無　略音嚮、而祇以德國進兵橫貫土國爲慮也、此次新的已袪德方進兵之可能性、而阻塞德方進窺近東之一途、故於英國亦有價值、一般人對於德國何以亟欲在任何條的下對土簽訂條的、頗感詫異、若干觀察家謂、德方獲有一旦德國如兵蘇聯時、土國守中立之保障、德方報紙對蘇聯官方塔斯通訊社最近所發關於蘇德關係之言論旣置諸不理、及外間復有希特勒不久將要求蘇聯以貝薩拉比亞歸還羅馬尼亞、並作經濟上重大讓步之傳言、此皆可謂德擬有事於蘇聯之佐證、而德方之厚集重兵於蘇聯邊陲、更可從對土訂的事獲一解釋、或謂德土條的或將使德土貿易稍見擴展、但衆認土國未能准許德力亟需之穀類源源輸出、且條的之簽訂未必能袪除此間對德之猜疑、蓋土國人民皆知德方之諾言與保證價值如何也、德方宜傳部長戈培爾必將利用對土條的、自詡爲外交勝利、以抵銷軸心方面在美之挫折、惟從土方所堅決要求在條的序言中之明白聲明、可見土國仍忠守其對英同盟、蓋土國堅持須有此聲明、吾則不尤簽的也、</p>
<p>德土元首　互換電文</p>

<p>哈瓦斯二十日匈京電　德土兩國友好條的簽字成立之後、此間政界人士頃加以評論云、此項條約在軸心國與英美兩國所從事之外交戰上、頗爲重要、緣自土國於一九三九年與英法簽訂三國互助條的之後、德土兩國關係頓趨惡化、是以此次簽訂友好條的、對於兩國關係當可目爲一種安定的因素云、</p>
<p>此約在德　得失參半</p>
<p>路透社二十日倫教電路透社特別通訊員稱、土德十年友的簽字之消息、倫敦外國大使館聞之聳肩、某淪陷關前任駐英大使稱、「前未與德國締結不侵略條約者、殆僅土其其一國、其他各國於互不侵犯之條的墨瀋未乾時、即皆被侵略、今此十年友的、殆爲土國之惡兆歟」、此項消息條然而來、固使英國民衆爲之不愉快、然英外部早已獲聞一切、以實際言、此的在德互有得失、其所得者有一、一爲希特勒可因此而自豪曰、歐洲征服國與未征服國今皆準備接受新秩序之福利矣、一爲在蘇德戰爭發生時、土國可守中立、至於其所失者、則德國不能以土國爲侵入糜蘇爾油田或往救叙利亞之大道、而希特勒對非之進攻亦將愈覺困難、就種種現象察之、希特勒似有進攻蘇聯在拿破侖前所失敗處試騐其命運之　、蓋攫取油與糧之供給、實以此爲捷徑也、</p>
<p>東報觀察　德蘇前途</p>
<p>路透社一十日東京電「讀賣新聞」今日載文、謂德土協定似將迫令蘇聯甚至犧牲共近東之利益、而與儂國合作、土耳其加入軸心國之營壘、大有利於德國、昔魯登道夫將軍嘗有言曰、「土國在第一次次歐戰中、立於德國方面、使德國能延長抵抗兩年之久」、就往事觀之、土耳其雖戴中立之假面具、而常願傾向軸心國、協的國猶屬其次、故德土協定僅爲土耳其傳統政策之天然結果、新協定似甚足使簽字國除經濟外、於其他方面亦彼此親善、尤共因德國於第一次歐戰後會努力輔助新土耳其之建造也、</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（六四）　英國苦戰中的實况</h3>
<p>這幾篇都是Christian　Science　Monitor駐倫敦訪員的通信，茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>此次歐戰，在空戰方面已達到一個轉變的階段。英德雙方爭奪制空權的嚴重時期，已經開始，其間英國空軍實力已臻開戰以來最堅强的地位，不但對於敵方夜間空襲的防禦已有進步，且能採取主動，用更新式更有力的飛機，侵入敵境實施反攻。除非德方能有出奇制勝的表演，否則英國所佔的空中優勢，此後必將日益顯明。</p>
<p>這種形勢不僅反映英國官塲的樂觀言論，而是慎重經過客觀的精密分析後所得的結論。記者自從美國回來以後，對於英國所受轟炸的損害，和空戰的軍要意義，會親往各地直接調查。記者會觀察英國空軍的活動，及其最近的空防，會和一般駕駛員，參謀員，飛機工業的生產者，與消息靈通的中立觀察家討論過各方面的情形。</p>
<p>就記者實地調查所得，英國在空戰中的形勢，去年夏間確是十分險惡，入秋以後尤屬岌岌可慮，冬季亦無起色，然在今日，確已顯有進步，前途愈見光明。</p>
<p>關於空戰前途，現有三個主要的問題：其一，英國受德機六個月轟炸的損害，實際範圍及重要性如何？其二，英國防禦德轟炸機連續不斷再接再厲的攻擊，其希望究竟如何？其三，英國對德採取切實有效的攻勢，其可能性如何？</p>
<p>記者自回到倫敦以後，即親自考察，並飭各同事實地考察英國被炸最烈破壞最甚的區域。曾經直接調查的地方，有考文屈萊，白明罕，卡狄夫，斯在西，倫敦工業區，倫敦市，倫敦東區，船塢區域及其他各地。記者常以全日考察被炸區域和市鎮，且會親受轟炸，被迫離開公寓，因此可說是經騐之談。</p>
<p>英倫三烏的城區市鎮，甚至平靜的鄉村，遭受轟炸的損失當然極大，實際更是非常奇特。沒有一個人能像記者一樣的立在考文屈萊市中心，而不感到極權國行爲的殘暴，和德國飛機的玉石不分，任意濫炸。倫敦鬧市大部份已化爲焦土，沒有人能游行於其頹坦敗瓦之間，而不感到德機破壞的慘烈。倫敦東部住宅區域，現已被震得墻坍壁倒，寂靜無聲，沒有一個人能徘徊其間，而不感到敵機的滅絕人道。</p>
<p>話雖如此，記者見了這種無可計算的損失後所遺留下來的印象，却不是英國所受的損失如何之大，而是實際上如何的輕微。以此與未遭毀損的房屋市鎮比較，其損失眞是如何渺小，在軍事意義上，其損失又如何微末。英國軍事設備所受的損失，實際上可說是微乎其微。</p>
<p>在戰略上具有重要性的軍事設備，如飛機塲，船塢，兵營，鐵路，工廠，與煤氣廠等，當然亦有被炸彈命中的，可是所受的損害，大都甚輕，即使有很重的，也能趕快修復。工廠被毀，或是破壞到不能修理的程度，一轉瞬間又移在別所房屋內積極生產了。</p>
<p>各地所受轟炸的損失，若與整個地方比較，損害亦甚微，像倫敦就是一個最好的實例。倫敦二百餘萬所房屋，被炸毀和受到重大損失的，若與祇有輕傷和震毀門窗的作比例，眞可以說一句一渺乎小哉！」</p>
<p>倫敦所受全部損害的統計，固然不能發表，但看現有一萬七千個兵士在淸理被炸區域的瓦礫，和拆毀搖搖欲倒的房屋，也可以略得梗概了。工程師鄧南上校對於前途仍非常樂觀。他說，希特勒決不能毀滅倫敦，因爲倫敦太大了。一個人祇耍到倫敦市和全國考察一下，便可得到這個印象。</p>
<p>然而這個有利的結論，必須假定對於敵機接連不斷的積極轟炸—特別是夜問轟炸—能作更有效的防禦，因爲沒有一個國能經得起道樣漫無限制的猛炸的。</p>
<p>直到現在，英國人的抵抗力，絲毫未見動搖。英倫仕女，雖在轟炸之下，依然抱着無窮的勇氣，冷靜而愉快地過着他們的生活，確是最堪注意的一件事。</p>
<p>這種優良的民氣，無疑地是因爲一般人都感覺到英國的攻守地位，都在繼續不斷的進步之中。這種進步現又經過一重要階段。防禦夜間轟炸已有顯著的功效。今年三月上半月中，有四十三架德國轟炸機擊落，這是具有重大意義的一個事實。</p>
<p>過去四五月中，英國會用各種實騐方法，力謀解決夜間轟炸問題，從上面的數目看來，足見已大有成效了。</p>
<p>最近德國飛機於夜間轟炸格拉斯哥，勃列斯多，赫爾和倫敦，各地受災均極慘重，顯見要消滅或减少夜問轟炸的威脅，尚有許多要事須做。但也有數點是已經獲得進步了，例如新式的波福型夜間戰鬥機，高射砲瞄準器，和其他秘密設計等皆是。</p>
<p>至於白畫防禦德機轟炸的戰鬥機也有平行的發展。噴火式和旋風式飛機，皆有好幾種新型產生了。</p>
<p>最重要的，厥爲英國空軍，不但在防守方面，即在攻擊方面，也已有適宜的配備，其大部分自應歸功於美國。美機已開始飛英援助，數量果然可觀，而品質的優越，尤值得注意。</p>
<p>美製飛機究竟好到何種程度，是不難攏統地解答的。美製戰鬥機，雖比英製戰鬥機有若干技術上的微紐優點，行動亦比較靈便，但在速度，裝甲和武器配備上，顯然不足與英國的噴火式或旋風式戰鬥機相頡頏。</p>
<p>現在到達英國的新式美國戰鬥機，如寇蒂斯式，對於以上各種弱點已有改進，若照此不斷地改良，則美國戰鬥機，最後必能與改良後的新式噴火機和旋風機藝術，可是離開這一步還遠着呢。</p>
<p>轟炸機方面的情形多少與此相反。去年春夏之交，英國空軍當局早已見到，在初秋之前，英倫上空就有發生空戰的可能，而且可知道至少在六個或八個月以內，決不能自美國獲得任何援助，祇得用最賢明的辦法去解決此問題，這是當時的事實。</p>
<p>他們把英國的生產，幾乎全注重於製造戰鬥機，這當然是防禦性的武器。他們又向美國定購長程轟炸機，那就是屬於攻擊性的武器了。</p>
<p>美國已有建造商運飛機的長時期試騐，其航空工業因之具着建造長程巨型飛機的最優設備。英國現在已能開始從美國接到這種飛機，且正在對德國應由守勢改取攻勢的緊要關頭。</p>
<p>實際上英機轟德國的軍事目標，已有數月，但是能携帶巨量重磅炸彈的長距重轟炸機，仍感不足。所以德國除白來門，漢堡和近海若干港口外，所受轟炸的損害較輕，其原因即在於此。</p>
<p>這些目標，像大陸上侵英根據地一樣，離開英國的根據地尙近，故可以雙引擎轟炸機作有效有轟炸。現在正有幾種優良快速的四引擎轟炸機從美國飛來，而英國本身，也有哈立法克斯式一類的新式長程巨型轟炸機造成，所以英國空軍重轟炸機隊的力量，正在迅速增加中。</p>
<p>英國在空戰前途，確已較前更爲樂觀。美國租借法通過，和羅斯福總統最近的演說，暗示英國能由美國獲得所需的飛機，不僅將由美國製造，且將實行送到英國，已使未來情形愈顯光明。此外，英帝國各部份飛機產量旣在進步之中，其訓練計劃所造就的飛機駕駛員員額，也已大有可觀了。</p>

<h3>震旦女大畢業盛典</h3>
<p>— 趙爾謙</p>
<p>六月是學校最活動的季節、舉校當局忙於送舊迎新、畢業典禮正在陸續舉行、招生廣告又復重新上市、各個學校總是照例的異常興奮而忙碌、震旦女中文理學院也是當中的一個、筆者於昨日午后驅車赴震旦大學女子文理學院、因時間尚早、遂作全校巡禮、雖然是走馬看花、然而印象極佳、旋蒙該校招待員指導、得參觀大中兩部的成績展覽、大學部的畢業論文、國學研究、英文作品、教育圖表、和中學部的理化試騐、史地成績、工藝作品、頗有精美佳妙之作、雖然是琳瑯滿目、美不勝收、終因限於時間、不及遍覽、遂拾級下樓、參加畢業典禮、</p>
<p>身入震旦禮堂、馬上令人產生深刻的感想、無疑的、牠是崇高壯麗、光明軒敞、不啻一座水晶宮、粗俗的說、牠好像從前百樂門的舞廳、文雅的說、牠是北平淸華大學禮堂的替身、在這裹、坐着千餘來賓和學生家屬、滿儲着喜悅的心情和期待的心理、忽然間禮堂門啟、畢業生魚貫而入、中學生衣制服、大學生衣畢業禮服、黑衣道寇、飄飄欲仙、大有唐宋人風度、似乎從此棄絕塵寰、不復旗袍赤臂矣、在上海惠主教的指導下、由校長胡文耀作簡短演說后、遂協同院長能理、開始授予學位、一幕莊嚴隆重的典禮、遂在歡呼和掌聲中結束、從此以后、國家又多一支斯巴坦式的婦女生力軍、她們是新時代的婦女領袖、是教育·理化·經濟·家政·各方面的專門人才、對於社會必能有所貢獻、決不是希特勒式的「賢妻良母、專供給戰塲上鬬士的來源、」（見歐洲的內幕第八頁）她們是愛眞理、好自由、民主國內的理想公民、</p>
<p>震旦女校雖在霞飛路市塵中心、但以樹羣林立、又離馬路較遠、貿易叫囂之音、車輛馳騁之聲、充耳不聞、是以俗不傷雅、鬧中還能取靜、唐人有「曲徑通幽處、禪房花木深」的詩句、眞是這裹忠實的描寫、一位大四同學對我說、「住在這裹、越發令人想到西南和內地的同學、那裹有課堂、那裹有寢室、在空襲中上課、在茶館內讀書、一件衣服三人穿、一本教科書四個人搶、我們物質方面的亨受抵、抗不住精神上的痛苦、所以格外讀書、格外努力……、」</p>
<p>德國哲人菲希特於普法戰爭之餘、大聲疾呼、鼓吹普及教育、他那有名的「向德意志全民演說」、不但是教育史上有數的傑作、并且是復興德國的張本、今日中國百孔千瘡、一無是處、其艱難困苦情形、誠超過普魯士萬萬、五四運動后的文藝哲理教育、蘆溝橋事變前的科學工程教育、中日戰爭期中的國防教育、似乎尚未收着顯著的效果、然而教育的性質是進步的、樂觀的、創造新中國、沒有取巧的捷徑、當前的康莊大道、還是努力爭取全民的普及教育、</p>

<p>厚薄粳國米、亦轉呈先緊後疲之局、結果一起一伏、適成定局、初以洋米續緊、人心並佳、在銷旺貨主扳售之下、若南港新鮮高貨早晚稻、曾開百三十六元半、中關百三十四元、後見洋米轉疲、即亦相隨回貶、祇開高貨百卅五元、中關百三十三元、卒與前市相仿、不過特別新鮮原包因久已無到、貨稀為貴、艷俏異常、竟開百四十一元、大市開百三十九元、無錫原包宿粳、則以市貨無多、交易有限、所以市面不若早晚稻之靈活、自做開百念六七元、嗣後始終未有升降保住此槃、似尙挺秀元砠、</p>
<p>糯米去路、旣不如他貨之廣、市面遂亦較為平穏故昨洋米雖多變化、而此獨站平、無論國洋兩貨、售價均守原槃、計開香港團粒仍為百十八九元、長粒百十六七元至百十五元、糯菉高自百十元、次至百零五六元、國元特別百念五六元、次至百念二元、</p>
<p>大批洋米轉口運津、恰和洋行日陞輪、今日裝載洋米二萬餘包運往天津、該項洋米一部日陞輪由港裝載、原船運津、一部係源生輪由港裝來、在其昌棧轉裝日陞輪運往天津、又有苞米四千　　包、今日裝太古公司順天輪、運往烟台、（祖）</p>
<h3>洋粉大漲小回</h3>
<p>粉　日昨現洋粉市况、大漲小回、蓋以邊日猛漲、其勢巴透、究緣新麥上市之期、而國際風雲變幻莫測、海外來源、一時未必即行中斷、故人心雖堅、不敢再事拉抬、除本客實銷徵動外、獲利囤戶已有趁高出籠之意、故金龍粉開槃即鬆至三十一元三角、惟中途稍有客胃、價復盤高至三十一元六角半、比上日略小角半、砲毫粉三十二元三角亦小角許、尙有雙鷹牌做開三十一元五角、綜計成交二萬三四千包、華廠平賣粉照常維持、據廠方表示、倘若前定洋麥不到、兼新麥來滙被禁、則平賣粉勢必中止云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥交易停頓如恒、查新麥來源、旣遭禁阻、迄無暢通之望、日廠拋進之貨、一時亦未見運到、陳麥早已落令、新陳不接時期、市塲買賣、一致停頓、聞目下內地新麥雖在湧登、而產價反見高昂、故來申一節更覺失望云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆餅挫落愈甚</h3>
<p>豆餅市面、自多頭失敗以來、其跌風之慘烈、至今尤甚、至其原因、則今庚出口幫辦胃裹足、內地銷塲有錫常一帶供給、以致實銷不起、期貨籌碼充溢、多頭難以抬頭、大勢非有特殊刺激、未克挽回頹勢、昨市現餅亦挫三四角、期餅再跌八九角至一元不等、計開肥字餅六百餘片、價為十六元八角、綠字餅（五月下棧單）五百片、十六元八角、甡餅千片、（五月下棧單）價為十七元三角半、又五月下棧單六月下交二千片、價為十七元七角、六月上棧單六月下交五千片、價為十八元二角至十七元六角、又六月下棧單七月上交三千片、價為十八元至十七元九角、</p>

<h3>紗花　藍鳳轉升　雙馬漲風有力</h3>
<p>高見一五二三元</p>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風殊熾、此因邇來雙馬紗需要殷切、港幫搜　尤甚　以致籌碼日緊、人心挺秀、至於空頭、因廠單缺乏、天天掉期貼出、鑒於市面不能下降、意態未免灰心、向時藍鳳標紗自狂落後、亦轉上峰、所以一般浮空忍痛抵直、以後再作計　、但國際局勢仍屬利空、不過原料已見趨昂矣、上午二十支雙馬高價為一千五百十六元、低價為一千五百元、午後塲外初做一千五百十二元、漲至一千五百二十三元、最後價為一千五百二十二·三元、目前紗價已穿出一千五百十六元之新高峰、前途恐有一記跳面也、今日有棉紗一百九十五件運暹　、</p>

<h3>美棉來滬　運輸將感困難</h3>
<p>號廠訂購非常殷切</p>
<p>現棉情况、氣勢良好、外棉復升、以致人心愈固、二十支原料因紗銷發展、售價上昂、廠見開辦矣、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、人心興奮、市况熱鬧、連日除有各花號購進大批巴西棉外、更以外商紗廠訂購最學殷切、據可靠消息所傳、以後美棉來滬、不但運輸感困、水脚昂貴、且手續頗煩、需時甚久、因之棉市愈趨繁榮、實無疑也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因賣方拋出而跌、但繼之又因紐臭倫斯買進、及同業買進而回漲、結果收槃價格、較之上日漲十六七磅言、</p>
<p>印　棉市先因國外市塲堅昂、同時空　抵補及投機者買進而漲、續後又因經紀商售出、及多頭獲利了結而跌、昨日收盤價格、跌二三羅比不等、</p>
<p>又預測今日開槃市况看高二羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋細布猛騰</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨　平定、蓋東疋紗綫雖見步漲、廠方期額亦緊、惟廠布受現銷清淡之限制、現貨賣價提升月弱、結果白貨洲布斜紋粗布每疋漲一角至一角半、一部份漂染布漲二角半至五角、　街成交各布五百餘件、粵港幫辦藍布元斜坯布等貨一百餘件、北路烟津幫辦色布綫呢嗶嘰等一百餘件、</p>

<h3>綫粉干步鬆</h3>
<p>綫粉干市况、近以銷路呆滯、　値到存較多、價乃步鬆、如龍口粉本月初售過二百五十五元者、現已降至二百念五元、靑島粉僅二百〇五元、後辦者成本均高、無不虧耗云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　木炭銷塲呆滯</h3>
<p>木炭市塲、邇來內銷塲呆滯、本埠各棧、存底甚夥囤戶貨主亟求出脫、在此出多進少狀况下、宜為買主殺價、昨開同業拆價、平帽炭每担十六元、黃岩炭十二元六角、碼頭自車、送到每担另加車力一角云、</p>
<h3>雜項　香烟漲勢加厲</h3>
<p>火柴價步升</p>
<p>香烟　暗盤市况、漲勢驚人、買價圴創空前高價、同業及囤戶受加稅刺激、再以廠方停打棧單、故人心愈趨恐慌、紛向市塲猛力吸收、執貨　扳緊、少數脫手、市上現貨頓感缺少、故價飛漲不已、現市做開如五萬枝大英牌、每箱漲至一千六百—元、比昨猛升一百多元、老刀牌一千一百三十五元、品海牌　千零　十元、小仙女牌七百五十元、五華牌八百十元、十枝　大前門每萬四百四十元、五十枝又四百八十元、五十枝大負牌每萬二百六十元、買價均較的高起六十九至百餘元不等、</p>

<h3>美輪應徵軍運後　前訂船期均取消　補充調整後將重訂航期　中美客貨運輸照常維持</h3>
<p>美國總統輪船公司自所屬柯立芝總統號·庇亞士總統號·搭虎脫總統號·克利扶倫總統號、及世界班傑克遜總統號·海士總統號·亞當士總統號等七輪、由美政府航務委員會決定微爲軍用後、曾將各輪班次重加調整、幷有特開兩周班航行之意、但時迄昨日、繼被徵輪之一柯立芝總統號於前日駛美報到待命之後、忽將以前所定船期完全取消、而各輪船名亦均秘而不宣、</p>
<p>庇亞士輪　按期返美</p>
<p>昨日該公司通｜吿稱、「下月初有郵輪一艘駛美、如有諮詢、請至本公司接洽、至以前所定太平洋班及世界班各輪船期、一概取消、重訂之船期、將於短期內發表、」按下班駛美之郵輪、據公司原定爲庇亞士總統號、於七月五日離滬、七月十五日扺火奴魯魯、七月二十二日抵舊金山、該輪亦已列爲被微軍用、故下月初駛美後、即將改爲海軍輔助艦之用、以後不再行駛遠東矣、</p>
<p>太平洋綫　繼續維持</p>
<p>又悉被徵軍用之郵船、除上述者外、傑克遜總統號及搭虎脫總統號兩艘、亦包括在內、以後仍由該公司管理航行太平洋綫與世界班者、則爲泰來·瑪特遜·格蘭·海立遜·鬥羅·茄斐爾·范盤侖·泡克·白却南·的翰遜·戴勒·菲爾摩等總統號十二艘、曁其他貨輪多艘、</p>
<p>貨運方面　無虞中輟</p>
<p>至於該公司貨運方面、仍將竭力照常供應、蓋雖有七輪被徵、該公司當設怯維持中美交通、更可，用軍輸船隻之剩餘艙位、作通常之貨述、故遠東之美商航業、顯不致因美政府之非常措置而感動搖、美洲及遠東問之航業、除總統輪船公司外、尙有福來輸船公司經營之貨輪、由滬經日駛洛杉磯·紐的·波士教·費城及巴爾的摩、達拉瑪輪船公司天祥洋行經營之滬美錢、由滬至紐的、費時三十四天、</p>

<p>旅滬美僑薛佛（前任美國總統郵船公司庇亞士輪二副）夫婦一行、昨晨乘長一百六十四尺之帆船「山橋」號離滬、橫渡太平洋赴舊金山、據薜佛氏稱、此舉並非冒險行動、然其所乘之帆船、爲彼親自設計、重二十五噸、確爲航行北太平洋中最小者、現颶風季節巳過、上海與加里福尼亞間、其途程爲五千英里、若每日可航行一百英里、則五十日可達目的地、該輪過去　出發二次、皆以中途發生意外、不克成行、此次該輪備航行儀器、以測騐氣候、同行除薛佛夫婦外、有前曾服務公共租界捕房警員二人、一名包優、一名惠克旦、</p>

<p>覊泊在漢臯三載之荷輪　S.S.Wilhelmina　號·　S.S.Beatrice　號·　二艘、及葡輪S.S，Sado　號一艘、始於本年三月中、得日海軍部之特許、釋放來滬、三輪均由荷商福順公司經理、抵埠後卽加修理、並入塢檢騐船身等、今已次第工竣、葡輪S.S.　Sado號、巳於昨日中午出口赴秦皇島、載運煤斤來滬、荷輪S.S.　Wilhelmina　號、昨亦移泊法租界浦面太古浮筒、日內卽將開航、另有一荷輪修理亦已工竣、大致開航亦在不遠、</p>
<h3>爲發展後方工業　四行撥款</h3>
<p>中中交農四行爲　展後方工業起見、經聯席會議商沬、以一萬萬元貸放、並與經濟部工業司採取聯絡辦法、辦理工廠遷移擴充、及增加設備貸款、與倉庫抵押貸款、小工業貸款等、凡後方自由區域之工廠、均得申請貸款、貸款數額並不限制、必要時決將總額增加、視實際需要而定、業已訂定具體貸放辦法、按步實施、</p>
<h3>全巿罷工人數　昨日最少　不足三百人　工潮趨弭平</h3>
<p>據負責方面宜稱、昨日全市罷工工人、人數爲最少、不足三百人、以商務印書館本市發行所、雖尙在罷工中、但其總管理處巳定於下星期一開始工作、而同時馬勒公司浦東碼頭一部份工人的四百名、罷工一星期後、今巳無條件復工、據捕房昨日發表、另一新罷工發生於小沙渡路一四三五號永豐（譯音）綢廠、參加者僅三一十人、</p>
<h3>銀錢兩業　六底結賬</h3>
<p>民國二十三年上半年度銀錢業結賬期轉瞬將屆各銀行錢莊業巳開始辦理結息、（一）儲蓄部准六月二十日結息、（二）商業部准六月二十五日結息、並定七月一日及二日辦理半年決算、對內則照常辦公、對外半年結算休假、在此結息結賬期內、一切放款業務暫行停止、六底到期之款、循例終六月三十日以前完全淸償、惟銀錢兩業爲扶助工商業起見、對到期之款、予以通融辦理、有關各業市塲、決定於銀錢業辦理半年決算期內、停市二天、於七月三日（星期四）起、與各行莊同時復業交易、</p>
<h3>英商公共汽車　下月又將加價　傳須漲價至百分之五十　工部局下週開會是核准　職員加薪建議亦將通過</h3>
<p>公共租界英商中國公共汽車公司、前聯同雷車公司、呈請工部局核准再加票價、當由該局於上周四召開常會時、予以研究討論、結果、批准　車公司自本月二十八日起再照現行票價增加百分之五十、公共汽車加價案則暫爲擱置、</p>
<p>下週會議　可望核准</p>
<p>惟據昨日所得消息、該局以公共汽車加價一案尙多考慮、故特囑令公用事業委員會於前晚開會時重予審議、結果認爲此項加價、「與特種營業章程、幷無不合、」實無不可通過之理由、故此一原案、可望於下星期四工部局常會時正式核准、其開始日期、傳爲七月一日、較電車加價延遲兩天、至所加之數、據悉亦爲百分之五十、現售一角之票價、當增加至一角五分、</p>
<p>生計日艱　不勝負擔</p>
<p>但市民僉認公共車輛、非至必要時不應漲價、而今該兩公司竟又以物價高漲爲藉口、企圖剝削大衆利益、而獲得較多之利潤、實可痛心、且工部局將予以核准、尤屬令人匪解、故亟盼下周四開會時吾決公共汽車之加價案、吾則「有求必應」、將置全市人民利益於何地、</p>
<p>加薪問題　亦可解決</p>
<p>又工部局職員普遍加薪案、自經銓叙委員會提出、交由局會核議、而結果延擱後、會由銓叙委員會於本星期一開會時重議、結果未經宣佈、衆信於下周四開會時、將予核准、共所以上次未經通過者、與其謂局方顧及各界迫切之呼籲、免因職員薪水再增牽連物價上漲、不如謂該局自身財政情形有所考慮、蓋據悉銓叙會所提之原案、係將職員之生活津貼由百分之一百五十增加至白分之一百八十至二百、或照純收入（包括基本薪給生活津貼及米貼等）增加四成至五成、故一旦　行、工部局歲出、必大形增加、唯一般市民認爲職員普遍加薪、直接影響物價之高漲、始終抱反對之態度、</p>
<h3>銀聯會减低拆息　消滅匯劃升水　各行荘需要匯劃向該會平掉　軋平匯劃劃頭存息消滅升水</h3>
<p>新滙劃制度實行後、滙劃貼水逐步跌落、乃與劃頭平掉、近因滬市游　益見充斥、而現鈔收付須點數、且不無風險、不如票據授受之便利、故最近市上滙劃票據</p>
<p>反須升水</p>
<p>頃銀行聯合準備委員會、爲調劑滙劃與劃頭籌碼之供求起見、巳規定各行莊如需要滙劃、可隨時以劃頭向該會平掉、對同業匯劃存息、自十日起巳减至每千元每日三分、十一日起又將各項滙劃利率實行减低、計公單拆款息、承兌滙票九十日期貼現率及同業滙劃放款息、均由以前一角五分减爲八分、而對於領用同業滙劃息、前爲每千元每日一角二分、現亦减爲八分、而錢業</p>
<p>巿塲拆息</p>
<p>自十日起、突掛開三分、較九日回低四分之多、因滙劃貼水消滅之後、竟發生滙劃升水、於市面頗有影響、拆息等掛做、旨在使滙劃劃頭兩種存息先行軋半、然後消滅滙劃升水、同時儘量供給籌碼、使其永久成爲平掉、</p>

<h3>慈聯會啜粥貧民　每日五千餘人</h3>

<h3>當局已接洽　運煤輪隻</h3>
<p>頃據煤業界消息，木月初本市各煤公司曾紛電印度安南等產煤區訂購鉅額洋煤、總數的達二千五百噸左右、每噸成交價格僅合國幣四五十元不等、令該項巳成交煤塊屑業於產區裝輪、刻巳在運滬途中、據悉最遲可於本月底運抵此間、現各煤公司仍繼續致電各產煤區訂購大宗煤塊屑、以期運滬調劑、故本市整個燃料問題、若無投機煤商之活躍市塲、恐慌似已成過去、記者又向各煤業公團探悉、裝運煤斤航輪、現甫由租界當局與各煤公司曁各航輪公司分頭接洽中、以期裝煤航輪增加班次、屆時非特水脚可吿减輕、嗣後煤塊屑來源亦可以增多、</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>離婚</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>有些「有情人終成眷屬」的夫婦，偶有齟齬，發生意見，就開口離婚，閉口離婚，尤其是一部份事實上一知牛解而自以爲「新派」的靑年，更容易患這種毛病。</p>
<p>其實離婚是醫治夫妻不睦的良藥嗎？不一定是！</p>
<p>最近美國調查離婚五年以上的婦女對於離婚的意見，有一些出人意表的有趣發現。其中百分之五十對於當初的貿然離婚，表示遺憾，以爲今日假使再遇到同樣的問題，她們是不至於跟丈夫離婚的。百分之三十四對於離婚表示欣幸。還有百分之十六則和她們的丈夫「破鏡重圓」了。</p>
<p>以上這些事實，證明離婚並不是醫治婚姻疾病的萬靈藥。</p>
<p>我並不反對離婚的制度。在有些「無可救藥」的夫妻間，離婚的確是有如割除毒瘡一樣的爽快與必要的。但是，我反對以婚姻爲兒戲，在婚姻生活中毫無忍耐與適應的能力，而以離婚爲家常便飯的人。</p>
<p>如果你想離婚的話，希望你平心靜氣地想一想「是不是値得道樣做的？」</p>
<p>婚姻</p>
<h3>兩性生話</h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>蘊快做新嫁娘了，整天裏充滿着愉快，活躍，</p>
<p>是的，這是可寳貴的一段，所謂人生『一樂也』，這是最高峰的境地了。</p>
<p>她常向我問起許多婚後的事，尤其是關於應付丈夫方面的。瞧她的神情，似乎很想硏究一些什麽『御夫術』之類。至少，她對於未來的理想家庭是有相當計劃的。</p>
<p>我甚願蘊的理想得以『如願』，但我不能肯定她的理想，因爲婚姻生活，決不像少女時代所想像的那麽神秘。反之，它是極平凡的一回事。問題就在您怎樣使這『平凡』的兩性生活，變作神秘的，有意義的。婚姻的成功在這裏，婚姻的失敗也在這裏！</p>
<p>比方說，瓊——蘊的愛人，他有着英俊的氣慨，筆挺的西服，配上一個鮮明的領花，說話是那麼柔和，態度那麼謙遜，那麽體會到蘊的每一個思想！蘊的最深處，會讚上一句：『瓊是英雄！』</p>
<p>蘊吧，她的美麗誰能比上？尤其是兩顆戀人的酒渦，使她値得驕傲！——『天使哪，』瓊已經公開地誇獎過了！</p>
<p>等着，他倆結婚了！蜜月了！共同起居了！或說是『百日紀念了』了！我就可以保證；瓊也不是英雄，蘊也不是天使！</p>
<p>您會看見瓊是多馬虎的一個粗人，發着的臭背心還不肯換下來；上寫字間去，常　把錶忘帶了；您　着他回來吃飯，他偏是姗姗來遲！甚至，他會拿着報紙，在馬桶上坐上一小時。</p>
<p>您也會看見蘊小像從前似的常說　Dear　John，皺着的旗了袍會穿上身去，一張黃臉，顯得怪醜，什麽美麗？</p>
<p>早前，他倆同樣戴上一副太陽鏡，感得對方是一個了不得的人物，如今陰翳除去了，眼睛分外明亮，只見對方盡是『疵，毛』——從南極反到北極來。</p>
<p>所以我吿訴蘊：</p>
<p>『別把瓊估的太高，自己也別太自負，一切超水準的理想，都會掉到水準下來。</p>
<p>『兩性生活是現實的，所以誰都不能以「手段」「做作」來應付對方！可不見歐美人士夫妻在公園裹親暱得肉麻，回去照樣在家裹大打出手？都市中離婚案件的增加，多數爲了想施展什麽「成竹」所致。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦廋鷗</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的荘稼人</p>
<p>他把疊在櫥頂上的一口小皮箱取了下來，借着暗黃色的燈光，開始把出門應該需用的東西放進箱子裏去。</p>
<p>好幾年不曾出過門的人，走的時候當然不是　好一口小皮箱就成的；他先得把家裏的事和他叔父交代一番，而在那個已經準備「飽則遠颺」的奶媽子的面前，他也不能不囑咐幾句。</p>
<p>「旣然你們決定要回去，那我當然也不能彈留。」他把小梅寳抱在自己的懷裏，看着王四夫婦兩個說：「可是這孩子還小，至少在我沒有打京裏回來以前不能沒有人照應，你們可以再待一個月走嗎？」</p>
<p>做主人的越是說得這樣客氣，那個奶媽子的心裏，倒反而覺得怪不好意思起來。</p>
<p>「依爺說就是啦！」王四也不由臉上一紅，很小自然地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>家裹的事情安排妥當以後，在出門之前所要解決的問題，就祇剩敢因難的兩件了：第一是他應該穿短衣還是穿長衣，第二是臉七要不要再罩紗布？因爲他目己一時不能解決，便特地去找他叔父和堂兄商量，大家像籌備什麽婚喪大事一樣的足足討論了兩個多鐘頭。關於第一個問題，他叔父以爲他雖然已做了四五年的莊家稼人，但行動上還是顯得很斯文，又目身邊提着那麽一口新式的皮箱，穿短衣委實有些不稱。秋海棠自己跟吳大兩個人，也覺得吳老爺子說的很對，因此不曾費掉多少豫疑的工夫，便一致議決該穿長衣了。（一三八）</p>

<h3>裝簾遮陽眼鏡</h3>
<p>— 李義</p>
<p>在這炎陽挺　的及季，一團黑色的遮陽鏡，一副副地上市了。你在馬路上一看，東也兩團黑點，西也兩團黑點，然是有趣。不過在外國，道種黑越越的眼鏡，現在已不時髦了。</p>
<p>最近外國的眼鏡商，異想天開，在眼鏡的上部，裝上一列簾子，作用與夏天窗口的竹簾相差無幾。這種遮陽眼鏡，對於遮蔽，由上照射而下的陽光，效果與全黑色的眼鏡相同，可是戴這種裝簾眼鏡的人，其視綫却可以不至受影響。這種眼鏡的簾子，有一種是用流質注人眼鏡中的，有一種是用金屬的綫糾成的。</p>
<p>我眞想：蘊瓊是兩粒多角形的小石，看他們如何彼此摩擦，彼此打攪，彼此頂撞，直到他們都成了光滑的石彈子！那時，他們會知道：</p>

<h3>路</h3>
<p>— 開壘</p>
<p>我說我們都是負着艱巨行囊的旅行人。</p>
<p>自從慈善的母親把我們帶到道世間來以後，我們已經是負着那個行囊了。只是那時有敬愛的父母携着我們的手伴着我們同行，使我們並不覺到牠底存在而已。</p>
<p>可是現在究竟是現在了，照着想像中的大鏡子，我知道自己的年紀確已到了二十歲，而且還參與過了高中的畢業典禮。</p>
<p>於是，我靜靜地聽見我父親的聲音：「孩子你自己去選擇你自己的路吧」。我又聽見我母親的可囑：「以後，是你自己行路的時候了；小心些吧，孩子」！</p>
<p>從此，我才測覺到了我自己的肩負。</p>
<p>然而我並不爲這而感到一絲懊喪，我曾於一個寂靜的深夜，向着滿天的星斗發誓，我說我將以自己的明亮如炬的眼光來替代昔日父母的指導，我也將以自己二十年的力量來担負起肩上的行囊。</p>
<p>而今終於有許多條路橫在我的面前了。</p>
<p>我有第二十個春天的驕傲，我有每個年靑人所具有的堅決，我用明亮如炬的眼光和沉毅的步伐，走上了我自己覺得應走的路。——那就是說，我已經選定了我未來的旅程，而決定以後生活的方向了。</p>
<p>讓被世故磨光了頭皮的人們去笑，讓頑固單純的人們去非議，正如一個眞摯的朋友來信所說：「我是我，我有信心，即使這條路出口很狹，也在所不計。我只擇性之所近者去學習研究，別人的搖頭諷言，我管不了這些」。</p>
<p>在我，覺得「路」的本身並沒有什麽「闊」和「狹」；路，只是「路」而巳，要達到那個日夜所縈繫的美麗的地方，每條「路」實在都是通徑。所不同的，「路」有它獨特的性質，我們要適合它，就在於你自己的個別的興趣，和無窮的努力而巳。</p>
<p>我們耍踢開「路」的「闊」「狹」和「通」「阻」的概念，而以自己的個性去併合自己的努刀去行「路」，那麽我們所期望着的光明，就會一天一天逼近於我們的眼前！</p>

<p>那麼流寇眞像探子所說的沒有舉動嗎？其實不然。流寇自從那天渡河不成，吃了一遭敗仗，敗退回去後，李自成勃然大怒，對他的左右說道：「我們人晋以來，每戰輒勝，却怎樣敗在周遇吉手裏？料那姓周的也是個人，不見得生就三頭六臂。代州的兵馬決不會像太原那麼多。太原可以攻下，難道代州却不能取勝嗎？」正要傾衆來犯，但他的軍師牛金星說道：「周遇吉本是將村，管領代州寗武兩地，早有英名，非庸驚之輩可比。我軍渡河即遭截擊，顯見得那邊防備得非常嚴密，不容我們安然渡河。我們不如表面上佯作按兵不動，以懈他們的軍心。過了數天，我們可在夜間進兵，攻其不防。我巳探得小龍河上游陳家渡水淺易渡，不如在那邊別出一隊精銳，偷渡過去，繞道夾擊。一面緊集船隻，從下流夜渡，別遣一枝人馬，到時在正面佯作進攻，使他們不注意別的地方，多方以誤之。李自成欣喜道：「這樣進攻，不怕周遇吉部下厲害了。」遂照着牛金星的計策行事。這天晚上王永泰獨坐中軍帳內，聽聽外面刁斗聲甚是平靜，但野風吹得很大，呼呼作響。時至三鼓，他尙不敢就枕。忽聽小龍河對面金鼓大鳴，心中不由一怔，暗想流寇竟米夜　來進攻嗎？不可讓他們渡過河來。便親自出帳，調集弓箭手到河邊去監視流寇，不讓他們渡河。這夜月黑風高，望到對岸去一片漆黑，並無火光，而鼓聲咚咚，却敲個不停。王永泰教手下騎兵排成一字畏蛇陣的形式，等候厮殺，但是却不見有一個賊兵渡河，心中暗忖莫非流寇故作疑兵之計，而在別處偷渡？遂令人去陳家渡探聽許靖那邊有何緊急。但是部下探子走得不遠，許靖早巳敗退下來。（九五）</p>

<h3>China's War Effort Receives International Aid, Victory is Within Sight: Outgoing Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui Bids Farewell to Colleagues in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Reviews China's Diplomatic Relations Over the Past Four Years</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Foreign Minister Wang, out of respect, hosted a tea party at 3 PM on the 19th to bid farewell to all staff members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In his address, he stated that China had endured four years of arduous warfare, and the diplomatic environment had also weathered storms, which could be divided into three phases: The first phase was when China fought alone; the second phase was the period of international sympathy; and now it has entered the first phase, which is the period of international assistance. It is evident that international justice will ultimately be manifested under the clear blue sky. China's current war effort is akin to Columbus' discovery of the New World. The shore of victory is within sight. Although we have faced dangerous storms, we will ultimately reach the final destination of victory in the war. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Outgoing Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui delivered a farewell speech to the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon. He first reviewed China's diplomatic relations over the past four years, stating that during China's four years of resistance, the international situation had undergone many changes. Our diplomatic relations during this period can be divided into three stages: China fighting alone, China's war effort gaining international sympathy, and China currently waging war with international assistance. After Wang finished speaking, he expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of all personnel over the past four years. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Today, fifteen Japanese aircraft raided Sichuan and Hubei provinces. The air raid alarm was issued at 10:30 AM when six Japanese aircraft flew into Sichuan, passing over Chongqing and arriving at Luzhou and Zigong in western Sichuan. These Japanese aircraft, when turning back east, passed over Chongqing without dropping bombs. Enshi, bordering the edge of Sichuan Province and western Hubei, was bombed by nine Japanese aircraft.

<h3>Japanese Military's Westward or Southward Advance: Unable to Make a Final Decision, the War Against China Remains Unresolved, Further Southward Advance Entails Greater Risks, Frequent Reports of Chinese Military Victories on Various Fronts in the North and South</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission: News reported on the 13th that there were over two hundred Japanese warships gathered on the sea off Yuhuan (Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 16th). The Japanese concentration of a large fleet here is clearly not intended to deal with China. Japan may launch a large-scale advance in the near future, etc. A reporter asked me whether the Japanese would advance westward or southward. I said that if I were to consider it for the Japanese military, it would be advantageous not to advance westward or southward. Why? Speaking of advancing westward, in my report on the war situation last week, I mentioned that the Japanese military, considering (that eight divisions cannot resolve a single mountain in China), if they risk a westward advance, there will inevitably be unimaginable dangers. As for advancing southward, given the limited strength of the Dutch East Indies, it is possible for the Japanese military to stake everything on a single throw of the dice. However, judging from the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies' tough speech a few days ago, it is clear that he has confidence. The Japanese military is already unable to extricate itself from the war with China. How dare they create another enemy? Therefore, whether the Japanese military will truly advance westward or southward by force is a decision that has not yet reached its final stage. Within China, the war situation this week, except for some battles on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the north bank of the Yellow River, remains generally quiet. On the south bank of the Yangtze River, only southern Hubei and southern Anhui have slight movements.</p>
<p>Southern Hubei</p>
<p>(1) In areas such as Dashaping, Guikou, and Baini Bridge in Chongyang, over a thousand Japanese soldiers gathered and advanced southwards in multiple directions towards Fuling, Maitianfan, and Qinglinling on the morning of the 11th. The Chinese military resisted and ultimately prevented their success. (2) Over a thousand Japanese soldiers from Nanlin Bridge in Tongshan advanced towards Hengshi River and Baoshi River on the morning of the 12th. The Chinese military repelled them. (3) Over a thousand Japanese soldiers from Shan harassed the south on the 14th, and another unit attacked Fangshi Qian. On the 15th, they continued to attack the Dayoushi and Outangshi areas. The Chinese military is currently encircling and attacking them.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers from areas such as Datong advanced towards Qiaotou and Yanghejiawan on the 12th. After being fiercely attacked by the Chinese military, the Japanese soldiers retreated in defeat. The Chinese military then recaptured Qiaotou and Yangke and continued to advance in pursuit. By the 13th, the original positions had been restored. It is estimated that over 600 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, including Japanese Captain Okamoto.</p>
<p>Yellow River</p>
<p>On the north bank and in the Shanxi-Henan-Shaanxi triangle area, there were small-scale battles. The Japanese military's objective was in Ruicheng. Japanese soldiers on the western route attacked from Fenglingdu and Beizhaocun. On the 11th, they attacked eastward through Xiaojia Town and Yongle Town. The Chinese army engaged them, killing many Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, fierce battles unfolded in the Dayangcun and Guren Cun areas west of Ruicheng. That evening, the Japanese military advanced to the outskirts of Ruicheng and joined up with the eastern route attacking westward from Monan Town and the northern route attacking from Shanyu Township. The Chinese military once again launched a fierce attack, shattering the Japanese positions. The Japanese military suffered heavy casualties. Except for a portion that was detained, most of them retreated. In addition,</p>
<p>Southern Henan</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers in Xinyang, gathering over a thousand soldiers, once again advanced in multiple directions. One unit attacked Yangmiao from Changtai, one unit attacked Luzhai from Banhe, and one unit attacked Chenjiadian from Muzhu River, advancing towards Pingchang Pass. The Chinese army was prepared and launched fierce attacks on them. The Muzhu River unit, although reinforced once, was immediately beaten back by the Chinese army. It is estimated that over 600 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle.</p>
<p>Southern Guangdong</p>
<p>The Japanese military advancing from Gujing and Mei was severely repelled by the Chinese army and suffered considerable losses. As for the Chinese military,</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Choosing a School, Difficulty in Getting Accepted</h3>
<p>Seeking knowledge is indeed a difficult matter, not difficult in reading books, but difficult in choosing a school. A good school, even if one is unwilling, will transform one into a virtuous person; a bad school, even with wisdom, will lead to shared depravity. Although this is not an immutable principle, it is a constant fact. Young people spend most of their time in school, spending more time with teachers and friends and less time with family. Therefore, while family education is important, school education is even more important. Today, due to the exigencies of the situation and limitations of the environment, universities in the Southeast have moved inland and concentrated in Shanghai. Shanghai is not originally a place for students to cultivate their moral character and study, the allure of pleasures, and the pursuit of wealth and profit are all sufficient to influence the will of young people, causing them to lean left or right, high or low. Instability of will leads to a lack of focus in studies, and without focus, the achievements that can be made are predictable. However, if schools can correct the malpractices of the times and show young people the way to conduct themselves in the world, it is not impossible to achieve positive results. But as academic levels rise, the degree of assimilation with society often deepens. It is evident that even with good customs and strict teaching, it is still no match for the ease of contagion of habits. If it is a case of descending to a lower level, then without those who practice diligently, have a strong will, and stand out from the crowd, few will not be assimilated imperceptibly. There is an old saying: "The poor do not learn extravagance, the rich do not learn frugality," meaning that it is a natural fact, and there is no need to learn it. But today's common ailment is that even with such national difficulties and such poverty among the people, they still indulge in comfort and poison, and indulge in ease and pleasure. The poor learn extravagance, and the rich become even more extravagant, leading to no shortage of aristocratic schools and teachers and students with a strong capitalist flavor, which is truly a great calamity in seeking knowledge. Young people are pure in nature, but the influence of customs is unavoidable. Being near vermilion turns red, being near ink turns black, five entries and five changes, the ease of change in character is such. Therefore, associating with honest and well-informed people brings the joy of having many virtuous friends; associating with flatterers and sycophants brings pride, idleness, and pleasure. Teachers should be happy to acquire and educate the talents of the world; students should also seek the teachings of famous teachers and good friends to achieve the effect of shaping and nurturing. In the past, Ma Yuan said to Emperor Guangwu, "In this day and age, it is not only the ruler who chooses the ministers, but the ministers also choose the ruler." I believe that seeking knowledge today is not only about schools choosing students, but students must also choose schools to attend. However, it is easier for schools to choose students, but difficult for students to choose schools.</p>
<p>Even if students have the desire to choose a school and study there, they must go through an entrance examination. Who can predict whether they will be accepted or not? The examination system is an old method from ancient China, and the abolition of the imperial examination was not only because of its prose but also because it relied on the length of a single day. Those selected were not necessarily all virtuous, and what was learned was not necessarily all practical. There were also corrupt practices involving connections and requests. Although those who violated the imperial examination regulations were subject to strict penalties, the malpractice never ceased, and those with influence could still easily advance. Therefore, it was attacked by those who advocated new learning. Can today's school entrance examinations not reveal the test questions to those they already know? Can they make admissions based solely on test scores without accepting requests and secretly accommodating them? Can they grade the test papers calmly and fairly, weighing every point without being swayed by emotions? In theory, this should not be the case. If it is, then the examination is merely a facade, following the bad habits of the imperial examination, which is definitely not what today's practical schools should do. However, the admission standards for the entrance examinations of various schools vary greatly in their strictness. If they are lenient, the test questions are simple, and the admissions are broad. After the students enter the school, they will be gradually eliminated based on their academic performance. There are also schools that believe the more students, the better. They accept all those who can barely pass, and everyone is on the list of successful candidates. This is losing through excessive leniency. If it is too lenient, the students' academic levels will be uneven, making it difficult to achieve a reasonable standard, which is not the way to learn. If they are strict, they deliberately play tricks on the test questions. They clearly study vernacular Chinese but test them with classical Chinese. They know that it is not a necessary subject, but they test them with necessary subjects. They do not read the Four Books and Five Classics, but the test questions are based on the Four Books and Five Classics. The standard of idioms is the most difficult to determine, and what is the benefit of knowing many idioms? Yet, they must test them with idioms and investigate their origins. This is no different from using riddles as gambling tools and comparing them with ancient texts. The test questions are very broad, but the time is deliberately shortened to confound them. Even if mathematics is difficult, there is a question whose answer cannot be fully written on a single piece of paper. There are even laments that they cannot finish the test. These are all irregular examinations. The way of testing should not be deliberately lenient or deliberately strict. It should be based on the academic level that the test takers have studied. If they are tested on middle school subjects, the test questions must be based on the high school textbooks that are generally studied. If they are applying to universities, the test should be based on the academic knowledge that high school students should generally possess. If what is tested is not what has been studied or goes beyond the level that should be possessed, then it is not testing but making things difficult, which is not the original intention of the examination. As for those who use difficult and strange test questions to enhance the reputation of their schools, their views are even more misguided.</p>
<p>It is difficult to choose a school, and it is also difficult to get accepted. However, this is not to excuse students who fail the entrance examinations. If a person is truly determined to learn, they can learn anytime, anywhere, and there will eventually be a day of accomplishment. If they are not determined to learn, even if they enter university and travel across the ocean, it will not be of practical benefit. The story lies in human effort, and learning is valued in self-study. If academic work is not precise and effort is not focused, it is a great mistake to blame heaven and others.</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Issue Notes to the United States to Close Their Consulates and Withdraw Staff by Mid-July, the Notes List the Crimes of the American Consuls</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th: The German Foreign Ministry yesterday handed a note to the American Chargé d'Affaires in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The note stated that the behavior of the American consulates and the American Express Company in Germany has long been subject to severe criticism. Therefore, the German government has no choice but to request the American government to withdraw all American consular staff and employees in Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the German-occupied parts of France, Yugoslavia, and Greece by July 15 at the latest and to close the consulates. The note also demanded the closure of all American Express Company branches in the aforementioned territories and the withdrawal of their staff because the behavior of the company's staff is harmful to German interests. The note also detailed the illegal activities of the American consulates, listing them as follows: (1) Redick, the American consul in Frankfurt, provided materials for anti-German propaganda speeches in the autumn of 1939 and passed on confidential information on wartime economic issues to a certain party. (2) Nelson, the American Consul-General in Munich, and Consul Bauer, made speeches attacking Germany and the German government and participated in anti-German activities in January 1940. (3) Clifford, the American Consul-General in Cologne, participated in espionage work in the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940, and, together with the Luxembourg Consul-General, used the secret code to point out that the German army would attack the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. (4) Kissincha, the American Vice-Consul in Hamburg, participated in espionage work in the spring of 1941, drawing a diagram of the Hamburg railway network's transportation hub and reporting on military construction near Hamburg, and planned to transmit this information. (5) Jacobsen, a former employee of the American Consulate in Oslo, was found in possession of various documents regarding the German occupation of Norway when he traveled from Oslo to Moscow in early December 1940, after being searched at the Norwegian border. It was clearly intended to be used for anti-German propaganda abroad, including a report on the transport of German troops to southern Norway and other German measures. Jacobsen admitted that the documents were obtained from Dr. Nelson, a former employee of the American Consulate in Oslo. (6) American consuls Claus and Hunter hid Sutton, a former employee of the British Consul-General in Paris, in their consulate in the autumn of 1940 for several months. Later, Sutton was arrested outside the consulate. When Sutton was in the American consulate, he engaged in espionage and sabotage against Germany. Sutton has now been sentenced to a long prison term. In addition, the consul assisted a British officer in Paris who had been captured by the German army but escaped at night. Ms. Yangen, an employee of the American consulate, entered the officer's name into financial documents and accepted a paper filled out by the British officer.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 20th: Officials announced that the American consulates in Italy will be closed, and American consuls and employees must leave the country by July 15. A German news agency reported that officials in Rome announced that the Italian Foreign Ministry sent a note to the American Embassy on Thursday, drawing their attention to the behavior and activities of the American consulates in Italy, which have caused serious criticism, and requesting the American government to withdraw its American consular officials and employees stationed in Italy and the occupied territories of Italy by July 15, and to close the consulates. The Italian government also reserves the right to close the American Express Bank in Italy.</p>
<p>US-German Relations Hanging by a Thread</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 20th: Although the Axis powers' request to close the US embassies in German-occupied territories and Italy in Europe did not reach the State Department until midnight last night, the United States began to express its willingness this morning because the United States has requested Germany to close all its consulates in the United States. It is believed here that the United States' response to the Axis powers will be to require Italy to close all its Italian consulates in the United States. Some of Italy's consulates in the United States have already been ordered to close a few days ago. The United States has a total of one hundred and three consulates in Germany, Italy, and German and Italian-occupied territories, but some of them have both consular and diplomatic functions and may not be affected by the Axis powers' request. If the United States orders Italy to close all its consulates, Italy will be a loser because Italy has forty-nine consulates in the United States, while the United States only has seven consulates in Italy. After the consulates are closed, the diplomatic relations between Germany and the United States will be hanging by a thread because only one embassy will remain on each side. Most international relations experts, given the rapidly developing hostile relations between Germany and the United States, even doubt whether even the minimum diplomatic relations between the two countries can be maintained in the future. Washington and Berlin have not sent ambassadors to each other for two years, and both embassies are held by diplomatic chargés d'affaires. Before demanding that Germany close its consulates, the United States had already expected Germany to retaliate, so Germany's move is not surprising in the United States. Now the diplomatic conflict between the United States and Germany is only a superficial formality, and many people are wondering when the diplomatic rupture between the two countries will occur. According to sources close to the government, President Roosevelt will not take the initiative to break off relations with Germany for two reasons: (1) President Roosevelt hopes that the German leader will break off relations with the United States first, because this German move can make the American people realize that Germany is already at war with the United States, thereby promoting the President's desire to stimulate the public and prepare to take strong steps against Germany. (2) The reason why the President hopes that Germany will break off relations first is that this German move will affect Japan. The reason for this argument is that if Germany takes the initiative to go to war with the United States, Japan may not be bound by its Axis promises and aid Germany. If the United States takes the initiative, Japan will regard the United States as a country attacking its allies.</p>
<h3>American Oil Tycoon Donates Funds to China</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 20th: The New York Committee of the United Rescue China Association announced that John Rockefeller donated US$50,000 to China for disaster relief. Donations in New York City alone have reached $303,731, and the total amount donated nationwide has exceeded $100,000. Rockefeller's letter of donation stated that the Chinese people's spirit of perseverance and endurance should be admired by all free people in the world.</p>
<h3>American Women's Rescue Team Comes to China to Serve</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 20th: According to an aviation message, Pickett, Director-General of the American Relief Committee, announced that the Committee has organized a large-scale rescue team to go to China to rescue civilians injured by bombing along the Yunnan-Burma Road. The team includes fifty British, American, and Canadian doctors, led by Canadian surgeon Dr. MacKlough, who has been a church doctor and member of the International Red Cross in China for ten years. Several members of the team have also participated in rescue work in Finland and Greece. The team is carrying ten ambulances and various surgical equipment. All expenses are provided by the Committee. The doctors and equipment will gather in Yangon and are scheduled to arrive at their destination in early July.</p>
<h3>Chinese Government Awards Medals to Americans Aiding China</h3>

The recipients include female writers Ms. Buck and Ms. Fischer, President and Vice President of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, Dr. Tuco and Mr. Mellenar, Secretary Welcom, and doctors Toller and McGothric.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Launch Fierce Attack: Heavy Fighting in the Suburbs of Damascus; Surrender Proposal Rejected by Dentz; British Forces Advance on Beirut Along the Coast</h3>
<p>Vichy dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 20th: British, Indian, and Tegart's forces, having advanced six miles yesterday, stormed into the garden district of the suburbs of Damascus in the afternoon, ending a twelve-day offensive. Official Beirut intelligence acknowledges that Allied forces have stormed into the suburbs of Damascus, stating that heavy fighting is still taking place in the southern suburbs of the city. Yesterday afternoon, the vanguard of the Indian troops entered the al-Ghouta Oasis. Damascus is located in the center of this oasis, which includes a series of consecutive gardens, crisscrossed and separated by irrigation canals and fences. It is said that these obstacles are impeding the advance of the Allied forces.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Cairo on the 20th: A communiqué from the British command in Syria stated that Allied forces have made further progress in the coastal area of Syria between Sidon and Beirut. South of Damascus, Allied forces continue to occupy important positions. In the central area, Allied forces have reoccupied Quneitra. The Vichy troops of the Moghrane brigade are now surrounded.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th: A British military spokesperson in Jerusalem stated that Australian cavalry patrols have reached Wadi Shahrur, fifteen miles from Beirut. British forces are continuing to advance on Damascus from the southwest, occupying the highway from Damascus south to Kiswe. British forces north of Damascus are encountering stubborn resistance from artillery. The Vichy forces resisting on the slopes of Jebel Qassioun east of Damascus appear to be faltering. To date, over 1,200 Vichy officers and soldiers have surrendered. General Dentz, the Vichy High Commissioner in Syria, seems determined to hold Damascus. Along the coast, British forces are slowly advancing from Sidon towards Beirut. It is expected that Vichy forces will resist before Beirut. Fighting continues in the vicinity of Damascus, including near the Mezzeh airfield. This shows that General Wilson's proposal, broadcast on the Palestine Broadcasting Service to General Dentz, to allow Vichy forces to withdraw from Damascus to avoid bombardment of the city, has not been accepted. The deadline for this proposal expired on Thursday morning.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Envoy Arrives in Cairo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rengo News Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 20th: It has just been learned here that Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt's special representative for munitions transport, arrived in Cairo by plane this morning.

<h3>Locusts Obscure the Sky in the Eastern Desert; Stretching for Two and a Half Miles</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Cairo on the 20th: Locusts obscure the sky in the Eastern Desert, stretching for two and a half miles and extending over half a mile in width. The provinces of Aswan and Qena in Upper Egypt have both been affected. The Ministry of Agriculture has dispatched several fully equipped teams of experts to kill the locusts.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Dutch East Indies to Cede 700,000 Acres of Oil Fields to Japan; Oil Fields Located in Borneo; Japan's Rights in the Area Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from London on the 20th: Reliable sources here claimed yesterday that the Dutch East Indies has agreed to cede 700,000 acres of oil fields to Japan, located in Borneo. This move recognizes that the Manggar peninsula in Borneo is within the sphere of interest of the Borneo Oil Company, which is under Japanese control. The company has obtained oil field concessions in the Sangkulirang area. This move by the Dutch East Indies greatly increases Japan's rights in the area. It is also rumored that Japan will demand similar concessions in the Bandjermasin area and northeastern New Guinea, but the Dutch reserve this right until the Borneo Oil Company has achieved considerable development, and will then reconsider. Observers believe that the Dutch will permit the Borneo concessions and that the breakdown of the Dutch-Japanese negotiations will not affect this. During the Dutch-Japanese negotiations, the Dutch refused to succumb to strong Japanese pressure. For example, it is said that Japan requested that the Dutch sell over 6,000 tons of manganese ore in 1941, but the Dutch were only willing to permit half that amount. It is also learned that the Dutch proposed to sell Japan 15,000 tons of rubber, 150,000 tons of nickel ore, 3,000 tons of tin and tin ore, and vegetable oil this year. During the negotiations, the Dutch also demanded that Japan increase its purchase of Java sugar and provide convenience to Dutch nationals and Dutch businesses in Japan.</p>

<h3>American Transportation Experts Arrive in China; Go to Chongqing to Help the Government Solve Transportation Problems on the Burma Road</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from San Francisco on the 20th: Three prominent American highway transportation experts are about to depart for Chongqing to assist the National Government in solving the problem of transporting materials on the Burma Road. These three are Daniel Arnstein of New York, Davis of Hartford, Connecticut, and Hellerman of San Francisco. At the request of the US government, they are going to Chongqing to serve. They will now travel to Chongqing by plane via Honolulu. Speaking on behalf of the three, Mr. Arnstein said, "After we meet with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek for talks, we will travel from Chongqing to Rangoon to inspect the road conditions along the way. We will make suggestions to the authorities on any areas that should be improved. Then we will reside in Rangoon to handle affairs, and we will only stop when the great task is accomplished. The Burma Road must be kept open."</p>
<h3>Air Defense Drill in Singapore</h3>

<h3>French Ship En Route to Saigon Intercepted by Dutch Ship</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Batavia on the 20th: According to an official announcement here, the French shipping company's 9,000-ton ship "Compagnie," en route from Marseille to Saigon, was intercepted last night in the Sunda Strait by a Dutch warship. Because the captain of the ship refused to cooperate, it was escorted to the port of Tjilatjap. One German passenger was detained there and the ship was permitted to continue its voyage.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of the Interior Asks Oil Industry to Cooperate with the Government</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 20th: Secretary of the Interior Ickes, speaking at an emergency meeting of oil industry officials representing two-thirds of the world's oil production, asked the US oil industry, worth $120 billion, to cooperate with the government to prevent the outflow of necessary oil products that would hinder America's efforts to defend democratic countries. Ickes later told reporters that if there is a need for strict control of oil due to oil shortages, then a system of issuing oil by certificate, used in the eastern United States, is one of the methods we should consider. He believed that not a drop of oil should be transported from the Atlantic coast to certain places. When asked if this included Britain, Ickes replied that what he meant was that it would be shipped out after government investigation, but that the oil needed by Britain comes directly from the producing areas, not from the east coast of the United States.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Washington on the 20th: Secretary of the Interior Ickes, at a press conference yesterday, explained the international dispute caused by the recent ban on oil exports from the east coast, saying that the order to ban oil exports was not specifically aimed at Japan, and that Japan's inclusion in this event was purely coincidental. However, Ickes said that he did not know why Japan wanted to obtain gasoline from the east coast, as gasoline is abundant in the Pacific. A reporter asked if it was because Japan wanted to supply gasoline to German submarines. Ickes declined to comment.</p>
<h3>Oxford Confers Honorary Degree on Roosevelt; Grand Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Cambridge, Massachusetts on the 20th: At the Harvard University graduation ceremony, British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard. At the same time, Lord Halifax, in his capacity as honorary chancellor of Oxford University, held a special convocation of Oxford University and conferred the Oxford Doctor of Civil Law degree on President Roosevelt. Due to the complexity of government affairs, the US President was unable to attend in person and sent his aide, Brigadier General Watson, as his representative. Since its establishment, Oxford University has only held a few convocations outside of the university, and it is unprecedented for the honorary chancellor to preside over such a convocation in person. In accordance with Oxford custom, Lord Halifax wore an embroidered gold-trimmed black robe. Forty people from Oxford University attended, including four Oxford representatives. The British ambassador read the diploma and said that President Roosevelt is constantly struggling to seek peace, justice, and freedom. Today, he not only defends freedom with his moving words, but also consistently provides, in a gradually increasing manner, the material assistance needed to finally defeat rebellious aggression. In order to express its deep respect for the President's noble character, the university has conferred this degree to admire his stance on safeguarding freedom, humanity, and law. President Roosevelt's representative, Brigadier General Watson, rose to read the President's statement, which included the aphorism "We are also born to enjoy freedom. We trust in freedom and are willing to fight to maintain freedom. We would rather die standing than live on our knees."</p>

<h3>British Fleet Arrives in Northern Finland; Soviet Union Seriously Watches Germany; Hitler Covets War Resources; Rumored to Have Made Harsh Demands on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Agence Havas dispatch from Vichy on the 20th: Observers here recently said that major events will occur in Europe in the coming days. However, there are currently two factors influencing the current situation, namely, the Finnish unrest and the signing of the German-Turkish treaty of friendship. Both of these are related to the German-Soviet issue. Finland has long taken military measures. However, according to the British announcement on the 16th of this month, Britain no longer recognizes Finland as a country capable of defending its independence. The British fleet then sailed to the sea near the port of Petsamo in northern Finland, and the situation in Northern Europe became tense due to the sudden arrival of British warships. As for Turkey, which was originally an ally of Britain, it has now concluded a treaty of friendship with Germany. Although Germany has not asked Turkey to allow German troops to pass through its territory when the current European war expands to the Near East, Turkey has assured Germany that it will remain neutral if war occurs outside of Turkish territory. At a time when both Germany and the Soviet Union are taking military action to strengthen defenses along their borders, its significance is naturally very important. However, the rumor that Germany has sent a final ultimatum to Moscow has not been verified.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from New York on the 20th: Political researchers yesterday carefully examined the rumors circulating in Europe and Asia about the possibility of war between Germany and the Soviet Union and concluded that such speculation must be viewed with considerable reservation. At present, it is impossible to make a firm judgment. Messages circulated in the past week include: (1) London expects that German-Soviet relations may reach a critical point within days after the signing of the German-Turkish treaty; (2) It is reported that residents of Helsinki, Finland, have been evacuated in anticipation of war; (3) Romanian messages slipping through the censorship net claim that the German army is establishing a strong base in Romania, seemingly in preparation for a military solution with the Soviet Union; (4) A report from Ankara, Turkey, states that Germany has concentrated 1.5 million troops on the Soviet border; (5) Unofficial British speculation suggests that while the British Air Force has been heavily bombing various parts of Germany, German planes have not bombed Britain for eight days, seemingly because Germany is concentrating its forces to launch a major offensive against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>International News Service dispatch from Budapest on the 20th: According to a report from Stockholm today, German leader Hitler sent a personal message to Stalin, inviting the Soviet Union to join the Axis and sign a forty-year economic pact with Germany. Stalin is currently studying Hitler's message, which is very harsh because it would effectively place the entire Soviet Union under Nazi economic control. It is said that Hitler's message pointed out that the Eastern situation should be resolved immediately. The Stockholm message also stated that Hitler suggested that negotiations should begin immediately on the return of Bessarabia and Bukovina. Stalin and his colleagues are currently studying the message and its implications. Hitler suggested that German highways should immediately extend to the grain-producing regions of Ukraine and the Baku oil fields. He also suggested that Germany and the Soviet Union jointly develop all resources in European Russia. It is reported that Hitler further suggested that German factories should be moved to the interior of the Soviet Union, outside the range of British bomber aircraft. He also said that Hitler was willing to supply the Soviet Union with workers, machinery, and capital, with the aim of promoting German-Soviet friendship and peace, and giving the Soviet Union the opportunity to gain the "benefits" of full cooperation with the Axis powers. The most reliable sources in Stockholm claim that Hitler's message was worded sincerely and was not in the nature of an ultimatum. Hitler also supported the Soviet Union's immediate return of Bessarabia and Bukovina, because Hitler pointed out that Romania's grain shortage was due to the annexation of Bessarabia into the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from London on the 20th: Reliable British diplomatic sources yesterday obtained intelligence that Germany had sent major "suggestions" or demands to Moscow. However, this intelligence has not been confirmed. These "suggestions" (or even demands) include: (1) A large increase in the supply of Soviet oil and wheat to Germany; (2) Allowing Germany to establish German naval bases in the Soviet Union, including Liepāja, Riga, and Tallinn, especially the establishment of submarine bases and shipyards, because other German Baltic shipyards are too exposed to the British Air Force; (3) The Soviet Union should allow German troops to station land and air bases in Bessarabia to monitor the implementation of the above two requirements. Although these people issued this message, they believe that a German-Soviet war can be avoided. They believe that Stalin will soon make major concessions and conclude a new agreement with Germany. At the same time, reliable sources arriving in London from Norway claim that German troops are using available ships to transport troops along the four coasts of Norway to the vicinity of Kirkenes. This move is a large increase in the number of troops that Germany is concentrating in Norway, similar to the increase in troops in Finland. The purpose of this move is believed to be that once the war begins, German troops will be able to suddenly attack Murmansk and Arkhangelsk.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Engaged in Intense National War Preparations; Moscow Remains Calm on the Surface</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden on the 20th: Swedish radio commentators and newspapers reported yesterday that the entire Soviet Union is currently engaged in intense war preparations, including the rapid mobilization of millions of Red Army soldiers and the evacuation of women and children from Soviet cities. A Swedish radio station stated that tourists traveling from the Soviet Union to Finland said that in the past few days, the Soviet Union's mobilization of reserve soldiers has become increasingly active. Trains traveling between Helsinki and Leningrad are almost entirely filled with soldiers and transport goods. Swedish newspapers published reports from Moscow saying that millions of Soviet children are being evacuated from the country's large cities. According to intelligence obtained from Helsinki, a British fleet in the Arctic Ocean is currently blockading the port of Petsamo.</p>
<p>Agence Havas dispatch from Moscow on the 19th: The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" reported today that Soviet troops are now practicing shooting in various western military districts and conducting landing exercises in the Odessa area.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 20th: It is not known here that Germany has made demands on the Soviet Union. Responsible observers have reason to believe that neither Germany nor Romania has had contact with the Soviet Union. There are currently no signs of a crisis in Moscow. Young men and women throng the streets as usual. If a mobilization order were issued, these people would have already been called up.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th: This morning's domestic news broadcasts from Moscow did not mention a word about international tensions or any war preparations. One message stated that with the arrival of summer, the resorts of the Karelian Isthmus on the Soviet-Finnish border have become extremely crowded. The clear weather has attracted many residents of Leningrad and nearby areas to visit the area.</p>
<p>Romania Does Not Forget Recovering Lost Territory; Soviet-Romanian Relations Are Openly Relaxed but Covertly Tense</p>
<p>Agence Havas dispatch from Bucharest on the 19th: Various reports that Romania has sent a final ultimatum to the Soviet Union have recently been denied by responsible parties here and dismissed as unfounded rumors. According to political figures here, Romania has been unwavering in its adherence to this treaty after signing a protocol to join the Axis alliance and will sooner or later be able to have all its territorial demands met with the help of the Axis powers, without necessarily resorting to force immediately. Regarding the current relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union, although the two countries have recently taken some military measures, such as concentrating troops in certain places, mobilizing reserve soldiers, and requisitioning all trains and automobiles for military use, relations between the two countries remain normal. The nightly implementation of blackouts in Romanian cities is mostly due to the tense international situation and cannot be seen as a kind of war action by Romania against the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Romanian press is extremely calm, and no newspaper has mentioned the relationship between the Soviet Union and Romania.</p>
<p>Rengo News Agency dispatch from Bucharest on the 20th: The Romanian government has requisitioned all grain stores in the country, for a period of one year.</p>
<p>Finland Calls Up Young Men for Enlistment; Implements Measures to Safeguard National Defense</p>
<p>Agence Havas dispatch from Helsinki on the 20th: Government agencies posted a Ministry of the Army notice this morning ordering young men born after 1897 to register with the authorities in preparation for enlistment.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Berlin on the 20th: A message from the German government news agency in Helsinki stated that Finland has implemented measures to safeguard national defense and that reserve soldiers have been ordered to undergo special training.</p>
<p>Hitler Is Full of Cunning Plans; Britain Will Surely Be Able to Cope</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 20th: Today, British Ambassador Lord Halifax said to visiting reporters that waging war against the Soviet Union will put a strain on Germany, as this matter will affect one of its sources of supply. This matter can only be caused by Germany coveting Ukraine's rich wheat fields and the Soviet Union's coal and oil. Lord Halifax said that Hitler's actions on the surface often do not match his preparations. Britain is prepared to cope with whatever actions Hitler takes.</p>
<h3>German-Turkish Friendship Treaty Signed; Soviet Union Shows No Reaction; Turkey Declares It Still Considers Britain an Ally; Widely Believed to Be a Stabilizing Factor in the Near East</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 20th - There has been no reaction here to the signing of the German-Turkish friendship treaty. The Soviet Union and Turkey concluded a non-aggression pact in 1925, maintaining relations between the two countries. This pact was renewed and expanded in 1929, and the exchanged documents between the two governments were published on March 25th of this year.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 20th - After the signing of the German-Turkish treaty, all parties in Turkey are saying "We Turks will not go to Vienna," and are eager to make clear that Turkey remains a friend and ally of Britain. Given the geographical and military situation, with German troops now near the Turkish border, the conclusion of this new treaty is clearly beneficial to Turkey. Turkey still adheres to a policy of non-belligerence and has no territorial ambitions towards any country, but is only concerned about the possibility of German troops passing through Turkey. This new treaty eliminates the possibility of German troops entering Turkey and blocks Germany's path to the Near East, so it is also valuable to Britain. People are generally surprised as to why Germany is so eager to sign a treaty with Turkey under any terms. Some observers say that Germany has obtained a guarantee that Turkey will remain neutral if Germany attacks the Soviet Union. German newspapers have ignored recent statements by the Soviet official TASS news agency regarding Soviet-German relations, and there are rumors that Hitler will soon demand that the Soviet Union return Bessarabia to Romania and make significant economic concessions. All of this can be seen as evidence that Germany is planning something against the Soviet Union, and Germany's massive concentration of troops on the Soviet border can be explained by the treaty with Turkey. Some say that the German-Turkish treaty may slightly expand German-Turkish trade, but many believe that Turkey will not be able to allow the continuous export of grains that Germany urgently needs, and the signing of the treaty may not dispel suspicions of Germany here. The Turkish people all know the value of German promises and guarantees. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels will certainly use the treaty with Turkey to boast of a diplomatic victory to offset the Axis's setbacks in the United States. However, the explicit statement that Turkey insisted on including in the preamble of the treaty shows that Turkey remains loyal to its alliance with Britain, as Turkey insisted on this statement before signing the treaty.</p>
<p>German and Turkish Heads of State Exchange Telegrams</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 20th - Turkish President İsmet İnönü and Hitler have exchanged telegrams regarding the conclusion of the German-Turkish treaty. According to the Turkish President's telegram published here, "This treaty guarantees genuine friendship between Turkey and Germany. The two countries and peoples have entered an era of mutual trust on this day, and we are determined to maintain it." Hitler replied in a telegram, "I am also convinced that Germany and Turkey have now entered an era of permanent mutual friendship." Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also exchanged telegrams.</p>
<p>Havas, Budapest, 20th - After the signing of the German-Turkish friendship treaty, political figures here have commented that this treaty is very important in the diplomatic war being waged by the Axis powers and the United States and Britain. Since Turkey signed a tripartite mutual assistance treaty with Britain and France in 1939, relations between Germany and Turkey have deteriorated sharply. Therefore, the signing of this friendship treaty can be seen as a stabilizing factor in relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Mixed Reactions to the Treaty in Germany</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - A Reuters special correspondent reports that the news of the signing of the German-Turkish ten-year friendship treaty was met with shrugs at the London Foreign Embassies. A former ambassador to Britain from a country that has fallen said, "Turkey is almost the only country that has not concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany. All other countries were invaded as soon as the ink on their non-aggression treaties was dry. Is this ten-year friendship treaty a bad omen for Turkey?" This news came unexpectedly, causing displeasure among the British public, but the British Foreign Office had already heard everything. In practical terms, this treaty has both advantages and disadvantages for Germany. One advantage is that Hitler can boast that both conquered and unconquered countries in Europe are now prepared to accept the benefits of the new order. Another is that Turkey can remain neutral in the event of a Soviet-German war. As for the disadvantages, Germany cannot use Turkey as a route to invade the Mosul oilfields or to rescue Syria, and Hitler will find it more difficult to attack Africa. From various phenomena, it seems that Hitler has intentions of attacking the Soviet Union, testing his fate in the place where Napoleon failed. Seizing the supply of oil and grain is truly the shortcut.</p>
<p>Eastern Newspaper's Observation on the Future of Germany and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated today that the German-Turkish agreement seems likely to force the Soviet Union to cooperate with the Nationalist government, even at the expense of its interests in the Near East. Turkey's joining the Axis camp is greatly beneficial to Germany. General Ludendorff once said, "Turkey, standing on the German side in the First European War, enabled Germany to prolong its resistance for two years." Looking at the past, although Turkey wears a mask of neutrality, it is often willing to lean towards the Axis powers, with the Allied powers being secondary. Therefore, the German-Turkish agreement is merely the natural result of Turkey's traditional policy. The new agreement seems likely to make the signatory countries close to each other not only economically but also in other respects, especially because Germany made efforts to assist in the construction of the new Turkey after the First European War.</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Sign Agreement on Cooperation in Defense Industry; Stipulates Methods of Raw Material Supply; Italy and Turkey Conduct Commercial Treaty Negotiations</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th - Germany and Italy negotiated on the issue of cooperation in the defense industry in Berlin from the 3rd to the 19th of this month. An agreement was signed by Dr. Clodius, Chairman of the German Committee, and Ambassador Giannini, Chairman of the Italian Committee, stipulating a joint plan for the supply of raw materials for Germany and Italy in the second half of 1941. Other economic issues have also been discussed, and special liquidation methods have been agreed upon regarding military payments.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 20th - Officials here declare that the commercial treaty being negotiated between Italy and Turkey in Ankara is expected to be signed next week.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 20th - Political observers here believe that the signing of the German-Turkish friendship agreement will definitely benefit Italian-Turkish relations. However, Italy and Turkey will not sign a similar treaty because the Italian-Turkish friendship treaty of 1928 is still valid.</p>
<h3>Hess Receives Prisoner of War Treatment in England; Butler Replies to Members of Parliament; Does Not Wish to Say Much About the Case</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Foreign Under-Secretary Butler yesterday replied in the House of Commons to questions about the Hess case, who flew to Scotland a month ago, stating that he was unable to fully answer the questions of the members for the sake of public interest. Butler did not depart from the government's current policy of silence on the Hess affair, saying that there was no mystery or worry about the Hess affair. Hess is a prisoner of war, and the British side is treating him as a prisoner of war now and in the future. Regarding the point of whether the Duke of Hamilton knew Hess, or whether Hess had corresponded with the Duke of Hamilton before fleeing to Scotland, Butler said that he had nothing to add to the words issued by Air Minister Sinclair. (Note: Sinclair said on May 22nd that the Duke of Hamilton had never met Hess and did not know him. Also, when Hess flew to Scotland, he parachuted near the Duke of Hamilton's house, claiming that he wanted to meet with the Duke of Hamilton to discuss a peace plan.) Labor MP Silverman interjected, asking whether the British side was treating Hess as a civilian prisoner or as a general. Butler said that Hess was being treated as an officer, entirely according to prisoner of war treatment, fair and without negligence. Speculation about Hess's reasons for coming to England could be left to the members to imagine for themselves. Silverman asked what the Prime Minister had told the US government, and why the US government knew things that the British people could not know. Butler replied that there was nothing that could be told to the US government that could not be told to the British people. However, in wartime, the diplomatic relations between Britain and other countries were endless, and he was sorry that he could not disclose them to Parliament. The British people should share the same goals as the government as much as possible, but regarding this case, we do not believe that speaking about it will increase public efforts, nor do we believe that not speaking about it will undermine public opinion. Butler spoke about the general policy points involved in the debate, saying that the government does not avoid expressing idealistic words that may not be realized in the future. We are currently working hard and are determined to carry this hard work through to the end. We not only want to build a new Britain, but also want to build a new Europe. This is work that we can carry out without having to make grand pronouncements.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Suggest Reforming Government Agencies</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Prime Minister Churchill reported in detail on the shipping situation when Eugene held a secret meeting during questioning in the House of Commons yesterday. The "Times" published an article yesterday stating that the Prime Minister is handling too many government affairs and should relinquish his position as a member of the Defense Cabinet, leading a small war cabinet, which would handle major events. Britain now has self-motivated and inspiring figures in the prime minister's office. If he could slightly reduce some of the heavy work he is currently undertaking, then the work he is currently doing would be even more valuable. Churchill's position is unassailable, and no one wants to attack him. The opinions disclosed by the "Times" yesterday are merely one of the ordinary and constructive criticisms that are common in democratic governance and do not contain any other meaning. At the same time, the House of Commons will vote to decide on Britain's war expenses of 1 billion pounds.</p>
<h3>Scottish Highlanders Participate in Defense; Born Brave and Skilled at Shooting; German Invasion Will Surely Meet Misfortune</h3>
<p>United Press, Scotland, 20th - At present, Scottish shepherds, gamekeepers, and others are engaged in defending the Scottish highlands to defend against aerial invasion. These people have already constituted the essence of the British domestic defense forces, with more than 1.5 million people. These people are mobilized in the Northern Highlands region, and their strength is equal to one of the largest defense units in the British Isles. Compared with the defense forces in London, the London suburbs, and other densely populated areas, they seem small, but the shooting ability of each of these people, with the people in the Kandaki Mountains, has already become one of the strongest guerrilla teams anywhere in the world. According to officials, they know almost everything that happens or moves in the mountain areas, and none of their shots are fired in vain. However, what has been said above is not exhaustive.</p>
<h3>British Air Force Again Attacks German Industrial Zone; Without Interruption for Nine Consecutive Days</h3>

<h3>War in Europe Discussions (64) The Reality of Britain's Hard Fight</h3>
<p>These few articles are communications from the Christian Science Monitor's London correspondent. They are translated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>This European war has reached a turning point in terms of air warfare. The serious period of the struggle for air supremacy between Britain and Germany has begun. During this period, the strength of the British Air Force has reached its strongest position since the beginning of the war. Not only has the defense against enemy nighttime air raids improved, but it can also take the initiative to invade enemy territory and carry out counterattacks with newer and more powerful aircraft. Unless Germany can perform a surprising victory, the air superiority that Britain has will surely become more and more obvious in the future.</p>
<p>This situation not only reflects the optimistic remarks of the British government, but is also a conclusion reached after careful and objective precision analysis. Since returning from the United States, the reporter has personally visited various places to directly investigate the damage caused by the bombing in Britain and the important significance of air warfare. The reporter has observed the activities of the British Air Force and its recent air defenses, and has discussed various situations with general drivers, staff members, aircraft industry producers, and well-informed neutral observers.</p>
<p>Based on the reporter's on-the-spot investigation, the situation of Britain in the air war was indeed very dangerous in the summer of last year, and it was even more precarious after autumn, and there was no improvement in winter, but today, there has indeed been obvious progress, and the future is becoming brighter.</p>
<p>Regarding the future of the air war, there are currently three main questions: First, what is the actual scope and importance of the damage caused by German aircraft bombing in Britain for six months? Second, what are the hopes for Britain to defend against the continuous and relentless attacks of German bombers? Third, what is the possibility of Britain taking a practical and effective offensive against Germany?</p>
<p>Since returning to London, the reporter has personally inspected and ordered colleagues to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the areas in Britain that have been most severely bombed and destroyed. The places that have been directly investigated include Coventry, Birmingham, Cardiff, Swansea, the London industrial area, the city of London, the East End of London, the dock area, and other places. The reporter often spent the whole day inspecting the bombed areas and towns, and has personally experienced bombing and was forced to leave the apartment, so it can be said that this is talk based on experience.</p>
<p>The urban areas and towns of England, Scotland and Wales, and even the peaceful countryside, have suffered great losses from bombing, of course, but the reality is very strange. No one can stand in the center of Coventry like a reporter without feeling the cruelty of the totalitarian country's behavior and the indiscriminate bombing of German aircraft. Most of the downtown area of London has been turned into scorched earth, and no one can march among its ruins and rubble without feeling the devastation of the German aircraft. The residential areas in the East End of London have now been shaken to the point where the walls have collapsed and the silence is silent. No one can linger there without feeling the inhumanity of the enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Having said that, the impression left by the reporter after seeing this incalculable loss is not how great the loss suffered by Britain is, but how small it is in reality. Compared with undamaged houses and towns, how small the loss is and how insignificant the loss is in military significance. The loss of British military equipment is actually negligible.</p>
<p>Military equipment of strategic importance, such as airfields, docks, barracks, railways, factories, and gas plants, has of course been hit by bombs, but the damage is mostly light, and even if it is very heavy, it can be quickly repaired. Factories are destroyed, or damaged to the point of being irreparable, and they are actively producing in other buildings in an instant.</p>
<p>The losses suffered by various places due to bombing are also very small compared to the entire area. London is a good example. Of the more than 2 million houses in London, the number that have been destroyed and suffered significant losses, compared to those that have only suffered minor injuries and shattered doors and windows, can be said to be a drop in the bucket. "</p>
<p>Although the statistics of all the damages suffered by London cannot be published, the fact that there are 17,000 soldiers clearing the rubble in the bombed areas and demolishing the houses that are about to collapse can give a general idea. Engineer Colonel Dunnam is still very optimistic about the future. He said that Hitler can never destroy London because London is too big. One can get this impression by simply visiting the city of London and the whole country.</p>
<p>However, this favorable conclusion must assume that a more effective defense can be made against the continuous and active bombing of enemy aircraft—especially nighttime bombing—because no country can withstand such unlimited bombing.</p>
<p>Until now, the resistance of the British people has not wavered in the slightest. It is most noteworthy that the ladies of Britain, even under bombing, still live their lives with infinite courage, calmly and happily.</p>
<p>This excellent national spirit is undoubtedly due to the fact that everyone feels that Britain's defensive and offensive positions are constantly improving. This progress is now going through an important stage. The defense against nighttime bombing has shown significant effects. In the first half of March this year, 43 German bombers were shot down, which is a significant fact.</p>
<p>In the past four or five months, Britain has used various experimental methods to try to solve the problem of nighttime bombing. Judging from the numbers above, it can be seen that it has been very effective.</p>
<p>Recently, German aircraft bombed Glasgow, Bristol, Hull, and London at night, and the disasters in various places were extremely serious, which shows that there are still many things to do to eliminate or reduce the threat of nighttime bombing. However, there are also several points that have already been improved, such as the new Bofors nighttime fighter, the anti-aircraft gun sight, and other secret designs.</p>
<p>There has also been parallel development in the fighters defending against German aircraft bombing during the day. Several new types of Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft have been produced.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the British Air Force has suitable equipment not only in defense but also in attack, and most of it should be attributed to the United States. American aircraft have begun to fly to England to provide assistance, and the quantity is indeed considerable, and the superior quality is especially noteworthy.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to answer in general terms how good American-made aircraft are. Although American-made fighters have some technical and subtle advantages over British-made fighters, and their actions are more agile, they are obviously insufficient in terms of speed, armor, and weapon configuration compared with British Spitfire or Hurricane fighters.</p>
<p>The new American fighters that have now arrived in Britain, such as the Curtis, have improved on the above-mentioned weaknesses. If this continues to be improved, then American fighters will eventually be able to reach the art of the new Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft after improvement, but it is still far from this step.</p>
<p>The situation with bombers is somewhat the opposite. In the spring and summer of last year, the British Air Force authorities had already seen that there was a possibility of air combat over the British Isles before the beginning of autumn, and it could be known that at least within six or eight months, no assistance could be obtained from the United States, and they had to use the wisest method to solve this problem. This was the fact at the time.</p>
<p>They focused almost all of Britain's production on manufacturing fighters, which are of course defensive weapons. They also ordered long-range bombers from the United States, which belonged to offensive weapons.</p>
<p>The United States has a long history of experimenting with building commercial transport aircraft, and its aviation industry therefore has the best equipment for building long-range, large-sized aircraft. Britain is now able to start receiving this type of aircraft from the United States, and is at a critical moment to change from a defensive to an offensive against Germany.</p>
<p>In fact, British aircraft have been bombing German military targets for several months, but there is still a lack of long-distance heavy bombers that can carry huge amounts of heavy bombs. Therefore, the damage suffered by Germany, except for Bremen, Hamburg, and several ports near the sea, is lighter. The reason for this is that these targets, like the invasion bases on the mainland, are still close to the British bases, so effective bombing can be carried out by twin-engine bombers. Now there are several excellent and fast four-engine bombers flying in from the United States, and Britain itself also has new long-range giant bombers like the Halifax being built, so the strength of the British Air Force's heavy bomber squadron is rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>Britain is indeed more optimistic about the future of the air war than before. The passage of the American Lend-Lease Act and President Roosevelt's recent speech imply that Britain can obtain the aircraft it needs from the United States, not only will it be manufactured in the United States, but it will also be sent to Britain, which has made the future situation even brighter. In addition, the aircraft production in various parts of the British Empire is progressing, and the number of aircraft drivers trained by its training program has also become considerable.</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin and Others Appraise Yang Weiquan's Album of Paintings</h3>
<p>The veteran painter Yang Weiquan is a master of both figure and flower paintings, with exquisite skill in both. His masterpiece "Pile of Brocade Ashes" is particularly ingenious. The design of his album of paintings has been in the works for a long time and has recently gone to print. Renowned figures from home and abroad have contributed appraisals. Several excellent pieces by Chairman Lin and the late Duan Qirui are recorded below: "The brush gives life to color, wielding two tubes; With a stroke of the blank, he skillfully creates form. The six methods naturally lead to the eight, Uniquely achieving the essence, surpassing great works." (Lin Sen); "May the Shang bronze tripods be passed down through the years, and the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties illuminate the eyes with beauty. Do not laugh at the casual strokes of the brush, for the master loves to sleep surrounded by books." (Yu Youren); "Heavenly Wu and Purple Phoenix convey ingenuity; Fortune, prosperity, mandarin ducks gather in the painting. The affairs of the world require your skillful hands; To organize and manage the scattered remnants takes effort." (Huang Yanpei); "Why should I not admire what others discard? Caressing its exquisite beauty, it surpasses the works of nature. Fragments and broken pages are all precious; The painting opens up a style of antiquity." (Duan Qirui); "How different from Qian Shunju, surpassing the 'Pile of Brocade Ashes.' The remnants are still worth picking up; Relying on your clever cutting and tailoring." (Zhang Binglin); "Why boast that hills and valleys can conceal the body? A true likeness is written in the painting of antiquities. Without embroidered robes and armored tents, the fragrance of banquets and the splendor of the Song dynasty naturally give birth to spring." (Xiong Xiling); "Gathering brocades forms a clever loom; The remnants and mouse droppings are all pearls. Empty are the corrections of 'Lu fish' and 'Hai pig'; Who can tell right from wrong in the messy pile?" (Hui Yu)</p>

<h3>Grand Graduation Ceremony at Aurora Women's University</h3>
<p>— Zhao Erqian</p>
<p>June is the most active season for schools. School authorities are busy sending off the old and welcoming the new. Graduation ceremonies are being held one after another, and enrollment advertisements are being re-launched. Each school is always exceptionally excited and busy as usual. Aurora Women's Arts and Science College is one of them. The writer drove to Aurora University Women's Arts and Science College yesterday afternoon. As it was still early, I took a tour of the entire school. Although it was a cursory glance, the impression was excellent. Subsequently, under the guidance of a school receptionist, I was able to visit the exhibition of achievements from the upper and lower divisions, including graduation theses from the university division, studies in Chinese classics, English works, educational charts, and physics and chemistry experiments, history and geography achievements, and handicraft works from the middle school division. There were many exquisite and wonderful works. Although there was a dazzling array and beautiful scenes, due to time constraints, I could not view them all. So I went downstairs to attend the graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>Entering the Aurora Auditorium immediately aroused deep feelings. Undoubtedly, it is sublime, magnificent, and brightly lit, no less than a crystal palace. To put it crudely, it resembles the ballroom of the former Paramount. To put it elegantly, it is a substitute for the auditorium of Tsinghua University in Beiping. In this place, sat over a thousand guests and student family members, filled with joyous moods and expectant minds. Suddenly, the doors of the auditorium opened, and the graduates entered in single file. The middle school students wore uniforms, and the university students wore graduation gowns. Black gowns and Taoist robes, ethereal and otherworldly, had much of the demeanor of the Tang and Song dynasties, as if they were about to abandon the mortal world from now on, never to wear cheongsams and bare arms again. Under the guidance of Bishop Hui of Shanghai, after a brief speech by Principal Hu Wenyao, he and Dean Nengli began to confer degrees. A solemn and grand ceremony concluded in cheers and applause. From now on, the country has another Spartan-style female force. They are the female leaders of the new era, specialized talents in education, physics, chemistry, economics, and home economics. They will surely make contributions to society and are definitely not the Hitler-style "good wives and mothers, solely for providing soldiers for the battlefield." (See page eight of "Inside Europe") They are ideal citizens who love truth, cherish freedom, and live in a democratic country.</p>
<p>Although Aurora Women's School is located in the city center of Avenue Joffre, it is surrounded by trees and is relatively far from the road. The sounds of trade and clamor and the noise of vehicles are not heard. Therefore, vulgarity does not injure elegance, and quietness can still be found in the midst of noise. The Tang Dynasty poet wrote, "A winding path leads to a secluded spot; A Zen room amidst deep flowers and trees." This is a truly faithful description of this place. A senior student said to me, "Living here makes us think even more of our classmates in the Southwest and inland areas. There are classrooms there, there are dormitories there, classes are held during air raids, books are read in teahouses, three people wear one piece of clothing, and four people fight for one textbook. Our material enjoyment cannot withstand the spiritual pain, so we study harder and work harder…"</p>
<p>The German philosopher Fichte, after the Franco-Prussian War, loudly appealed and advocated popular education. His famous "Addresses to the German Nation" is not only a masterpiece in the history of education, but also the basis for the revival of Germany. Today, China is riddled with holes and is useless. Its difficult situation truly exceeds that of Prussia by ten thousand times. The literary and philosophical education after the May Fourth Movement, the scientific and engineering education before the Lugou Bridge Incident, and the national defense education during the Sino-Japanese War do not seem to have achieved significant results. However, the nature of education is progressive and optimistic. To create a new China, there is no shortcut. The broad road ahead is to strive for popular education for all.</p>

<h3>Grain: Rice Merchants Wait for Prices to Rise; Government Sales Stand Out with Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Yangmi (foreign rice) sellers still considered continuing to raise prices, and real sales buyers also had a tendency to pursue purchases, making the situation tense. However, sellers held on too tightly, delaying the opening of the market. Unexpectedly, the situation quickly changed. A large batch of government-sold Xiaojiao rice suddenly appeared at low prices, selling for only 104.5 yuan to 104 yuan per dan. As a result, sellers were restrained, and buyers' thoughts turned to a wait-and-see approach, hesitating whether to advance or retreat. With a relaxed path to sell, sales intentions also loosened. The overall market was thwarted, and the situation quickly turned from tight to weak. Prices for all goods showed a downward trend, falling to 103 yuan to 102.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 117.5 yuan to 117 yuan for No. 2, 103 yuan for No. 1 Siamese, 118.5 yuan for High No. 2, 120 yuan for Secondary No. 2, 103 yuan for Jiafo rice, 103 yuan to 102.5 yuan for Min Dang rice, 120 yuan to 119 yuan for Zhongguan, 118.5 yuan for Xiaojiao Pudong Zhan, 118 yuan to 117.5 yuan for Puxi Zhan, 116.5 yuan for Zhongguan, 110 yuan for Tokyo Jianzhong Secondary, 93 to 94 yuan for No. 1 and 2 Mixed Broken Jian, and 75 to 76 yuan for No. 3 and 4 Broken. Afterwards, the inland rural villagers and local stores became more active, and the market turned stable. The market at the close of trading hovered around these prices, with no further changes. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, the statistics showed a decrease of more than two yuan. The British Hua Company was very weak in the morning, with No. 1 at 144 yuan and Xiaojiao at 144.5 yuan to 143.5 yuan, and forward contracts at 142 yuan. Broken rice was at 112.5 yuan to 113.5 yuan for spot and 108 yuan for futures, with a turnover of about 1,800 tons and about 13,000 bags for spot.</p>
<p>Thick and thin geng (japonica) Guomi (national rice) also turned from a tight situation to a weak one, resulting in an up-and-down pattern, settling into a stalemate. Initially, Yangmi continued to be tight, and people were optimistic. Under the sellers’ holding power in the active sales, fresh high-quality rice from South Port early and late rice once opened at 136.5 yuan, and Zhongguan at 134 yuan. Later, seeing Yangmi turn weak, they also followed suit and depreciated. Only the high-quality goods opened at 135 yuan, and Zhongguan at 133 yuan. The final results were similar to the previous market. However, special fresh original packages had not arrived for a long time, and goods were scarce and expensive, opening at 141 yuan, and the general market opened at 139 yuan. Wuxi original package old geng was not as flexible as early and late rice due to limited goods and limited transactions in the market. Since the self-made opening was at 106 or 107 yuan, there was no rise or fall after that, and it seemed to remain stable.</p>
<p>The route for glutinous rice was not as wide as other goods, so the market was relatively stable. Although Yangmi changed a lot yesterday, this one stood firm. Regardless of national or foreign goods, the selling price remained at the original price. Hong Kong round-grain opened at 118 to 119 yuan, long-grain at 116 to 117 yuan to 115 yuan, Nuo Lu high from 110 yuan, down to 105 to 106 yuan, and Guoyuan Special from 105 to 106 yuan, down to 102 yuan.</p>
<p>A large batch of Yangmi was transshipped to Tianjin. The Yang Company's Rich Sheng Wheel will load more than 20,000 bags of Yangmi to Tianjin today. Part of the Yangmi was loaded by the Rich Sheng Wheel from Hong Kong and shipped directly to Tianjin. Part of it was shipped from Hong Kong by the Yuansheng Wheel and transshipped to the Rich Sheng Wheel at Qichang Warehouse to Tianjin. There are also 4,000 bags of corn, which will be loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Shuntian Wheel today and shipped to Yantai. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Yangfen (Foreign Flour) Surges Then Falls Back Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot Yangfen market saw a large rise followed by a slight fall. The recent sharp rise in prices had been fully reflected. The period for new wheat to enter the market was near, and international affairs were unpredictable. Overseas sources may not be immediately cut off. Therefore, although people were firm, they did not dare to raise prices further. In addition to the real sales demand from local buyers, profit-taking hoarders were already intending to sell at high prices. Therefore, Jinlong flour opened at a loose 31.3 yuan. However, with slight buyer demand in the middle, the price recovered to 31.65 yuan, slightly more than half a corner higher than the previous day. Paohao flour also rose slightly by half a corner to 32.3 yuan. Shuangying brand also opened at 31.5 yuan. The total turnover was 23,000 to 24,000 bags. The Huachang Pingmai flour maintained as usual. According to the factory, if the previously scheduled Yangmai does not arrive, and new wheat remittances are banned, the Pingmai flour will have to be stopped.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat trading was as stagnant as ever. The new wheat source was banned and there was no hope of smooth passage. The goods thrown in by the Japanese factory had not yet arrived, and the old wheat had already been ordered off the market. During this period of disconnection between the new and old, trading in the market was unanimously suspended. It is said that although new wheat in the inland is surging, the production price is seen to be high, making the trip to Shanghai more disappointing.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains: Doubing (Bean Cake) Falls Sharply</h3>
<p>Since the failure of the bulls, the disastrous fall of the Doubing market has been even more severe. The reason for this is that the gang in charge of exports has been hesitant, and the inland sales market is supplied by the Xichang area, resulting in a failure in real sales. The future market is full of chips, and the bulls cannot raise their heads. Without special stimulation, the general trend cannot reverse the decline. Yesterday's spot Bing (cake) also fell by 3 to 4 corners, and the future Bing fell again by 8 to 9 corners to 1 yuan. The opening price for Feizi Bing was more than 600 pieces, priced at 16.8 yuan, and the opening price for Lu Zi Bing (May next warehouse order) was 500 pieces, at 16.8 yuan. The opening price for Sheng Bing was 1,000 pieces (May next warehouse order), priced at 17.35 yuan. Also, 2,000 pieces for the May next warehouse order, June next delivery, priced at 17.7 yuan, and 5,000 pieces for the June upper warehouse order, June next delivery, priced at 18.2 yuan to 17.6 yuan. Also, 3,000 pieces for the June next warehouse order, July upper delivery, priced at 18 yuan to 17.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Black Market Returns to Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listed exchanges all level. The black market for British and American exchanges was quite stable. Domestic and foreign rumors subsided. Speculators were overzealous in selling. The numbers were small, however, and the market was dull and flat. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants were slightly more willing to buy, but the Japanese bank Zhengjin and other banks sold off, maintaining stability. The final rate for British currency was 3 shillings 328125 and the rate for American currency was 5.4375 yuan, both level. Trading throughout the day was quiet.</p>

<h3>Rumors Subside, Gold Market Turns Stable; Spot Goods Squeezed Down by a Small Amount of 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market for raw gold suddenly turned stable, because domestic and foreign news and rumors subsided. The foreign exchange also had no changes, resulting in a situation where scattered supply and demand struggled. The situation that day turned from weak to firm. Foreign exchange merchants did some hedging sales, but some hat-grabbing speculators often came to push up the price. Therefore, the price retreated to 6,357 yuan, and then stepped up to 6,385 yuan in the afternoon. The final increase seen was 49. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 20,000 liang. Swapping futures (from June to July) had sellers issuing 512 yuan to buyers. Spot cash was very weak. In the morning, Chida issued a large amount of 10 yuan from Wanfeng, with the price being 260 yuan higher than the term trading price. In the afternoon, Tianyuan first issued 10 liang from Yida, 365 yuan higher, and then issued 30 liang from the jewelry industry, 350 yuan higher, squeezing down a small amount of 30 yuan.

<h3>Banks Close Accounts Yesterday; Money Industry Organizes Public List Research Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday (20th) was the semi-annual closing date for all banks. All current accounts and savings accounts were settled for interest separately. Due to the war, floating deposits increased, and there was a lot of hot money. The number of live accounts in each bank was high. The internal work of each bank had to be completed by last night.</p>
<p>Also, the British Citibank's national currency savings deposits were originally capped at 19,000. Starting today, the limit will be reduced to 5,000 yuan. Amounts exceeding the limit will not accrue interest. It is reported that all Chinese banks will also implement a current deposit limit system starting today, stipulating a certain amount for depositors, and amounts exceeding the limit will not accrue interest. The limit will be 19,000 or 20,000 yuan, depending on the bank.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association has convened a meeting of representatives from various Huichang money shops to discuss the issue of public lists and to gather the opinions put forward by the shops present. There are four items:</p>
<p>1. Advocate the continued use of the public list reporting form for negotiable instruments exchange, which should be marked with a 'zha zhun' character by each shop and submitted to the money bank.</p>
<p>2. Stipulate the time for collecting bills, restore the public list system, and improve it.</p>
<p>3. Adopt the exchange method of the clearinghouse for negotiable instruments.</p>
<p>4. Extend the exchange time by half an hour, and each shop that receives checks opens a public list.</p>
<p>Because this issue was not studied in detail, it was resolved to organize a public list issue research association, and it was assumed that seven representatives from each shop and two representatives from the money bank would serve as committee members. Proposals from each shop can be submitted in writing to the money bank and forwarded to the association for collective discussion.</p>
<h3>Securities: Northern Banks Heavily Absorb, Domestic Debt Exceeds Expectations</h3>
<p>Government Bond Informal Trading: Yesterday's market, although it slightly weakened at one point, remained upward after entering, and the momentum was even stronger than the previous day. With the Northern banks heavily buying in the afternoon, Class C bonds reached 72 yuan, Class B once reached 74 yuan, and Class A reached 81 yuan, with little difference. Class D even saw 69 yuan, and Class E settled outside 70 yuan. Under the circumstances of Northern banks heavily absorbing, the market is of course not easy to see as weak, and there is a possibility of breaking through the highest record of January 21st and 22nd of this year. However, after the close, there were sudden unfounded rumors, which although unbelievable, were enough to hurt the market. Based on the enthusiasm on the trading floor and the absorption situation, it does not seem like it will immediately decline. Yesterday morning, Xinfu, Defu, Yongchang, Yongkang, and Hongda all bought in, but Lianhe Lianyi, Tongkang, Runde, and Xie Kang supplied very actively. Class C bonds rose high and then fell, but the afternoon closing still returned upwards, comparable to the previous day's market and even slightly firmer. In the afternoon, the Northern banks' appetite remained strong, with Xinfu, Defu, Yongchang, Yongkang, and Dechang all buying in. Most of the market power was occupied by the Northern banks. Although Class C bonds opened flat, the trend was to rise step by step, breaking through the 2 yuan mark. Lianhe, Runde, Yitai, Tongshun, and Lu supplied a lot, and there was also an outflow of spot goods, making the situation extremely favorable. Class C and E bonds both maintained high prices at the close. Overall, the result of the day was another increase of 0.3 to 0.6 yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory were traded at a price of 18 yuan and 7.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the Public Business Association was very active, with both industrial stocks and rubber stocks showing solid potential. British-American Tobacco shares opened at 28 yuan and rebounded to close at 27.25 yuan. Jardine Matheson shares had strong buying interest, opening at 98 yuan and rising to 102 yuan, closing at 101.5 yuan. Rubber shares also showed improvement.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and stocks of various East Asian British companies were both flat, with no changes in market conditions.</p>
<p>Keadah Rubber Pays Dividend</p>
<p>Keadah Rubber Limited, managed by British firm Jardine Skinner &amp; Co., will pay an interim dividend of 6 jiao per share of national currency on July 4th for the year ending September 1941.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Blue Phoenix Turns Upward, Double Horse Rise Strong</h3>
<p>High Seen at 1523 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend was particularly strong. This is because Double Horse yarn has been in strong demand recently, with Hong Kong banks buying up even more, resulting in tight inventory and bullish sentiment. As for the shorts, due to the lack of factory orders, they have been paying backwardation every day. Seeing that the market cannot fall, their attitude is inevitably discouraged. After the Blue Phoenix label yarn fell sharply some time ago, it has also turned upward. Therefore, general floating shorts painfully covered their positions and will make plans later. However, the international situation is still unfavorable, but raw materials have already started to rise. In the morning, the high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1516 yuan, and the low price was 1500 yuan. In the afternoon, off-market trading initially made 1512 yuan, rising to 1523 yuan, with the final price at 1522.3 yuan. The current yarn price has already broken through the new peak of 1516 yuan, and there may be a sharp jump in the future. Today, 195 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with a peaceful market sentiment. The first transaction was usually at 1500 yuan, and soon rose to 1507 yuan. With the news that the price of gold was stable and the demand from Guangdong banks was not weak, shorts covered their positions, rising to 1512 yuan. Profiteers sold off slightly, and then fell back to 1502 yuan. The price fluctuated around 1505-1506 yuan for a long time. Unexpectedly, at 12:30, due to the depletion of inventory, scattered shorts covered their positions, and the price suddenly rose to 1516 yuan, closing back at 1512 yuan. According to statistics, 7850 bales were traded in half a day, including 850 bales bought by Hong Kong banks and 7000 bales traded among local dealers.</p>
<p>Market conditions for Jin Double Horse label yarn: the opening was flat, and then gradually rose, with a firm trend. The July contract rose 8.5 yuan, and the August contract rose 9 yuan. According to records, the total daily transaction volume was 1250 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Arriving in Shanghai, Transportation Will Be Difficult</h3>
<p>Mills Eager to Place Orders</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is good, and the price of imported cotton has risen, which has strengthened market sentiment. Due to the development of yarn sales, the price of 20-count raw materials has risen, and mills have begun to resume operations.</p>
<p>Another report: the Shanghai foreign cotton trading market is excited and lively. In addition to various cotton firms purchasing large quantities of Brazilian cotton in recent days, foreign yarn mills have also been particularly eager to place orders. According to reliable sources, the future arrival of American cotton in Shanghai will not only be difficult to transport, with expensive freight, but also the procedures will be quite cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore, the cotton market is becoming more and more prosperous, without a doubt.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to selling pressure, but then rebounded due to buying by New Orleans and buying by the industry. As a result, the closing price was up 16 to 17 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first rose due to firm prices in foreign markets, as well as short covering and buying by speculators. Subsequently, it fell due to selling by brokers and profit-taking by bulls. Yesterday's closing price fell by 2 to 3 rupees.</p>
<p>Also, the market is expected to open 2 rupees higher today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth and Fine Cloth Surge</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday morning. Although the price of Eastern cloth and yarn has been rising, and the factory's quota is also tight, the spot price of factory cloth is weakly lifted due to the limitations of current sales. As a result, white goods, Chow cloth, twill cloth, and coarse cloth each rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan per piece, and some bleached and dyed cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in the streets. Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers traded more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, raw slant cloth, and other goods. Northern brokers from Tianjin traded more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, serge, and other goods.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Buying and selling in Mok Street was active, and the spot price continued to rise sharply. The price of white goods, Longtou fine cloth, jumped by 1 yuan per piece. In the afternoon, the closing price was 46.25 yuan. The rise in the price of colored goods, Sijunzi serge, was particularly sharp, opening at 1.525 yuan and rising steadily. The highest peak in the aftermarket was 1.575 yuan, with the closing price at 1.57125 yuan, a sharp increase of more than 0.05 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (21st), 320 bales of cotton cloth were shipped to Siam, and another 200 bales were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Crystal Opens at 20,000 Bags Per Day</h3>

Xin Yi Company opened 5,000 bags of Dutch coarse crystal white sugar for shipment in July and August at a price of US$3.80, 99 deduction CIF example. The guild allocated the disk.

Arriving in March at 89 yuan to 88.7 yuan, arriving on January 22nd at 88.5 yuan to 89 yuan, arriving on January 22nd at 88.5 yuan. Dutch red ordinary sugar that can be issued with a delivery order was 69 yuan, KD mark 72 yuan, Jardine Matheson coarse crystal white sugar B mark road goods 106 yuan, DY mark East warehouse 95 yuan, bagged 93.5 yuan, HX mark 90.1 yuan, HM mark West warehouse 75.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Black Moss Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Black moss has remained in short supply recently, so the price continues to rise. New Zealand moss has risen from 96 yuan to 100 yuan, and Longya moss has also risen to 80 yuan. The market looks very lively due to strong demand, and is quite firm.</p>
<h3>Dried Mussels Are Tight</h3>
<p>There are not many dried Siamese mussels in stock, and people are already reporting a shortage. Large sizes are 230 yuan, and small sizes are 210 yuan. Domestic Ningbo dried mussels have not yet entered the market, and ghost mussels are also very scarce, selling for 500 yuan. The market is tight overall.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Golden Vegetables Slowly Rise</h3>
<p>The domestic stock of golden vegetables is becoming scarce day by day, and the market is gradually rising. Top-grade Zhuang vegetables are even rarer, with only 5 pieces left at the merchant's, and the price has been raised by 30 yuan. Gao Xiang Zhuang is also opened at 208 yuan, but ordinary Puer goods are cheaper, opening at 150 yuan, and there have been transactions.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli and Noodles Gradually Loosen</h3>
<p>The vermicelli and noodle market has been sluggish recently, with more stock arriving, so the price is gradually loosening. Longkou noodles, which sold for over 255 yuan at the beginning of this month, have now fallen to 215 yuan. Qingdao noodles are only 205 yuan. Those who handled it later have high costs and are all losing money.</p>
<h3>Coal: Charcoal Sales Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>The charcoal market has been sluggish in domestic sales recently. Various warehouses in this city have a large stock, and warehouse owners and cargo owners are eager to sell. Under this situation of more supply than demand, it is advisable for buyers to bargain. Yesterday, dealers opened up prices, with Pingmao charcoal at 16 yuan per dan and Huangyan charcoal at 12.6 yuan, self-pickup at the pier, with an additional 0.1 yuan per dan for delivery.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarette Price Increase Intensifies</h3>
<p>Match Prices Rise</p>
<p>Cigarettes: The informal trading market has seen an alarming rise, with purchase prices reaching unprecedented highs. Dealers and hoarders, stimulated by the tax increase, and with factories suspending order taking, have become increasingly panicked and are frantically absorbing from the market. Those holding goods are holding on tightly, with few willing to sell, and the spot goods on the market have suddenly become scarce, so prices are soaring.

<h3>After American Ships Were Requisitioned for Military Transport, Previously Scheduled Voyages Were Cancelled; Shipping Schedules Will Be Reordered After Supplementation and Adjustment; Sino-US Passenger and Cargo Transportation Will Continue as Usual</h3>
<p>After the United States President Lines' seven vessels, including the President Coolidge, President Pierce, President Taft, President Cleveland, President Jackson, President Hayes, and President Adams, were requisitioned by the U.S. Maritime Commission for military use, the company had adjusted the schedules of each vessel and even intended to open a bi-weekly service. However, as of yesterday, following the President Coolidge, one of the requisitioned vessels, having sailed to the U.S. the day before to report for duty, the previously scheduled voyages were suddenly completely cancelled, and the names of the vessels were kept secret.</p>
<p>President Pierce Returns to the U.S. on Schedule</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company issued a notice stating, "A passenger liner will sail to the U.S. at the beginning of next month. For inquiries, please contact our company. All previously scheduled voyages for the Pacific and World services have been cancelled. The reordered schedules will be announced in the short term." According to the company's original schedule, the passenger liner sailing to the U.S. should be the President Pierce, which was scheduled to depart Shanghai on July 5th, arrive in Honolulu on July 15th, and arrive in San Francisco on July 22nd. This vessel has also been listed for requisition for military use. Therefore, after sailing to the U.S. at the beginning of next month, it will be converted into a naval auxiliary vessel and will no longer sail to the Far East.</p>
<p>Pacific Line Continues to Operate</p>
<p>It is also learned that in addition to the above-mentioned vessels, the President Jackson and President Taft are also included in the requisitioned passenger vessels. The vessels that will continue to be managed by the company and operate on the Pacific and World services include twelve President-class vessels, including the Taylor, Matson, Grant, Harrison, Dollar, Garfield, Van Buren, Polk, Buchanan, Johnson, Tyler, and Fillmore, as well as many other cargo vessels.</p>
<p>Cargo Transportation Is Not Interrupted</p>
<p>As for the company's cargo transportation, it will continue to make every effort to provide normal service. Although seven vessels have been requisitioned, the company will try to maintain Sino-US traffic and may even use the remaining space on military transport vessels for normal cargo transport. Therefore, the American shipping industry in the Far East will not be affected by the U.S. government's emergency measures. In addition to the United States President Lines, there are also cargo vessels operated by the Fulei Shipping Company, which sail from Shanghai via Japan to Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and the Shanghai-US route operated by the Dalama Shipping Company and Tianxiang Shipping Company, which sails from Shanghai to New York in 34 days.</p>
<p>Four American Ships to Arrive in Shanghai This Month</p>
<p>The Ali Jibo, an American cargo fast ship managed by the Hualun Shipping Company, will arrive in Shanghai this morning from Saint Tu (transliteration) in the U.S. via Honolulu and Osaka. It is carrying a large amount of American goods to meet the needs of Shanghai merchants. The Fred Chou, a Fulei Shipping Company vessel with a deadweight tonnage of over 4,000 tons, will also arrive in Shanghai next Friday from Portland via Japanese ports with cargo. The Hubbard, a cargo vessel of the United States President Lines with a deadweight tonnage of 4,016 tons, will arrive in Shanghai next Thursday from the Panama Canal, Honolulu, Osaka, Yokohama, and Maji (transliteration) with cargo. At the same time, the De Bo, a cargo vessel of the same company with a deadweight tonnage of 3,703 tons, will arrive in Shanghai from Panama, Little Luzon, and Hong Kong with cargo. In the next ten days, there will be a total of four American ships arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sailing Boat Crosses the Pacific Ocean, Departed Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>An American expatriate couple, Mr. and Mrs. Xue Fu (formerly the second mate of the President Pierce of the United States President Lines), departed from Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the 164-foot sailing boat "Shan Qiao" to cross the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. According to Mr. Xue Fu, this move is not an adventure. However, the sailing boat they are travelling on was designed by him, weighs 25 tons, and is indeed the smallest sailing vessel in the North Pacific. The hurricane season has now passed. The journey between Shanghai and California is 5,000 miles. If it can sail 100 miles per day, it can reach its destination in 50 days. The ship has previously departed twice, but both times it was unable to complete the voyage due to accidents en route. This time, the ship is equipped with navigational instruments to test the climate. In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Xue Fu, there are two former police officers who served in the Public Concession Police Force, one named Bao You and the other named Hui Ke Dan.</p>
<h3>Rongwu Society to Lecture on Scriptures Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The sixth lecture on scriptures by the Rongwu Scripture Society will be held on the 22nd at the Bile Hall on the fourth floor of the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Huanlong Road. It is said that starting from this period, it will be a systematic lecture, which will still start at 3 p.m. old clock, 4 p.m. new clock. Listeners can go there on time.</p>
<h3>Three Ships Returning to Shanghai from Hankou Set Sail in Order</h3>
<p>The Dutch vessels S.S. Wilhelmina and S.S. Beatrice, and the Portuguese vessel S.S. Sado, which had been moored in Hankou for three years, were granted permission by the Japanese Navy in mid-March of this year to be released to Shanghai. All three vessels are managed by the Dutch firm Fushun Company. After arriving in port, they were repaired and inspected in dry dock. They have now been completed in order. The Portuguese vessel S.S. Sado departed yesterday at noon for Qinhuangdao to transport coal to Shanghai. The Dutch vessel S.S. Wilhelmina also moved to the Taikoo pontoon on the Bund of the French Concession yesterday and will set sail in the coming days. Another Dutch vessel has also been repaired and is expected to sail in the near future.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Allocate Funds to Develop Rear Industries</h3>
<p>For the sake of developing the rear industries, the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have allocated 100 million yuan through joint meetings for lending, and have adopted liaison methods with the Industrial Division of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to handle factory relocation and expansion, and increase equipment loans, warehouse mortgage loans, and small industrial loans. All factories in the free areas of the rear can apply for loans. The amount of the loan is not limited. If necessary, the total amount will be increased, depending on actual needs. Specific lending methods have been formulated and implemented step by step.</p>
<h3>The Number of Strikers in the City Was the Least Yesterday, Less Than 300 People; The Labor Unrest Is Trending Towards Resolution</h3>
<p>According to those in charge, the number of striking workers in the city yesterday was the least, less than 300 people. Although the local distribution office of the Commercial Press is still on strike, its general management office has decided to start work next Monday. At the same time, 400 workers at the Mallet Company's Pudong Wharf have unconditionally returned to work after a week-long strike. According to the police's announcement yesterday, another new strike occurred at the Yongfeng (transliteration) silk factory at 1435 Xiaoshadu Road, with only 310 people participating.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops to Close Accounts at the End of June</h3>
<p>The semi-annual account closing period for banks and money shops in the Republic of China in the 23rd year is approaching. Banks and money shops have begun to handle interest payments. (1) The savings department is allowed to pay interest on June 20th. (2) The commercial department is allowed to pay interest on June 25th, and the semi-annual settlement is scheduled for July 1st and 2nd. Internally, they will continue to work as usual. Externally, there is a holiday for the semi-annual settlement. During this interest payment and account closing period, all lending businesses will be temporarily suspended. Loans due at the end of June will be fully repaid before June 30th as usual. However, in order to support industry and commerce, banks and money shops will provide accommodations for loans due. The relevant industries and markets have decided to suspend operations for two days during the semi-annual settlement period of banks and money shops, and will resume business transactions at the same time as the banks and money shops on July 3rd (Thursday).</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Company to Increase Prices Again Next Month; Rumor is that Prices Will Increase by 50 Percent; Municipal Council to Hold a Meeting Next Week to Approve; Salary Increase Proposal for Employees Will Also Be Passed</h3>
<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company in the Public Concession, along with the trolley company, submitted a request to the Municipal Council for approval to increase fares again. The Council studied and discussed this issue at its regular meeting last Thursday. As a result, the Council approved the trolley company to increase fares by 50 percent of the current fare starting from the 28th of this month. The public bus fare increase proposal was temporarily shelved.</p>
<p>Approval Expected at Next Week's Meeting</p>
<p>However, according to sources obtained yesterday, the Council felt that there was still much to consider regarding the public bus fare increase, so it specially instructed the Public Utilities Committee to re-examine it at a meeting the night before. As a result, it was considered that this fare increase "is not inconsistent with the special business charter" and there is no reason not to pass it. Therefore, this original proposal is expected to be formally approved at the Municipal Council's regular meeting next Thursday. The start date is rumored to be July 1st, two days later than the trolley fare increase. The amount of the increase is also said to be 50 percent. The current fare of 0.1 yuan will increase to 0.15 yuan.</p>
<p>Difficult Livelihood, Unbearable Burden</p>
<p>However, citizens generally believe that public transportation should not increase prices unless it is absolutely necessary. Now, these two companies are again using high prices as an excuse to attempt to exploit the interests of the public and obtain more profits, which is regrettable. It is even more incomprehensible that the Municipal Council will approve it. Therefore, we urgently hope that when the Council meets next Thursday, it will decide to oppose the public bus fare increase proposal. We should not be "responsive to every request" and place the interests of the city's people in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Salary Increase Issue Can Also Be Resolved</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Council employees' universal salary increase proposal, which was submitted by the Civil Service Commission and submitted to the Council for discussion, but was delayed as a result, was re-discussed by the Civil Service Commission at a meeting this Monday. The results have not been announced. It is believed that it will be approved at the meeting next Thursday. The reason why it was not approved last time was not because the Council took into account the urgent appeals of all sectors of society to avoid further price increases due to increased employee salaries, but rather because the Council itself had financial considerations. It is said that the original proposal submitted by the Civil Service Commission was to increase the employee's cost of living allowance from 150 percent to 180 percent to 200 percent, or increase by 40 percent to 50 percent of the net income (including basic salary, cost of living allowance, and rice subsidy, etc.). Therefore, once it is implemented, the Municipal Council's annual expenditure will greatly increase. However, the general public believes that a universal salary increase for employees directly affects the rise in prices and has consistently opposed it.</p>
<h3>Bankers' Association Reduces Interbank Lending Rates, Eliminates Premium for Exchange Transfers; Various Banks and Money Shops Level Exchange Transfer Needs with the Association; Equalizing Exchange Transfer Interest Eliminates Premium</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new exchange transfer system, the exchange transfer backwardation gradually fell and became equal to the demand deposit interest. Recently, Shanghai's floating funds have become increasingly abundant, and the cash receipts and payments require counting and are not without risk, which is not as convenient as the acceptance and delivery of negotiable instruments. Therefore, recently the exchange transfer negotiable instruments on the market have actually required a premium.</p>
<p>Recently, the Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee, in order to adjust the supply and demand of exchange transfers and demand deposit funds, has stipulated that if various banks and money shops need exchange transfers, they can level them with the Association at any time with demand deposit funds. The interbank exchange transfer deposit interest rate has been reduced to 3 points per thousand yuan per day starting from the 10th. Starting from the 11th, various exchange transfer interest rates will be reduced, including the interest on public single overnight loans, the discount rate for 90-day acceptance bills, and the interbank exchange transfer lending interest, all reduced from 1.5 jiao to 8 fen. As for the interest on borrowing interbank exchange transfers, which was previously 1.2 jiao per thousand yuan per day, it has also been reduced to 8 fen.</p>
<p>Money Industry Market Overnight Lending Rate</p>
<p>Starting from the 10th, it suddenly hung at 3 fen, a decrease of 4 fen from the 9th. Because after the exchange transfer backwardation was eliminated, an exchange transfer premium occurred, which had a significant impact on the market. The purpose of overnight lending rate listing, etc., is to first halve the two deposit interest rates of exchange transfers and demand deposits, and then eliminate the exchange transfer premium, while supplying as much funds as possible to make it permanently level.</p>
<h3>Free Water Supply to Prevent Epidemics; Water Company Has Already Done So; Typhoid Fever is Widely Spread This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company, every summer, repeatedly complies with the request of the Sanitary Department of the Municipal Council to provide free water from certain street hydrants for sanitation and prevention of epidemics, which is of great value. It is learned that the company will continue to implement the above-mentioned water supply measures this year as usual. Therefore, the Sanitary Department has been working intensively in the Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road area in recent days. According to the Sanitary Department's past achievements, the above-mentioned epidemic prevention measures have been very effective in curbing epidemics. According to the monthly briefing last month, typhoid fever was more prevalent last month. Based on the records, more cases were discovered than in previous years. This disease occurs more frequently in summer and is highly contagious. Therefore, residents who have not been vaccinated against typhoid fever in the past two years should take this measure as soon as possible for prevention.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Rewards Electric Water Heater, Grants a Patent for Three Years</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that the Chisifu-invented Kaesiling electric water heater meets the requirements of the Industrial Technology Promotion Regulations. After examination, it was decided to grant a patent for three years. The reason for its acceptance is as follows: The main part of the water heater is an electric heating coil wrapped in a steel coil. The electric heating coil transfers heat to the coil, and the cold water passes through the coil and becomes hot water. The method of boiling water with electric heating has long been publicly known and used, but the water heater can simultaneously open the tap water faucet and the electrical switch on the tap water pipe, so that cold water passes through the machine and is immediately boiled into hot water and flows out continuously. It is light and practical, and should be granted a new patent for three years in accordance with Articles 1, Paragraph 2 and Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Promotion of Industrial Technology.</p>
<h3>More Than 5,000 Poor People Receive Congee Daily at the Cilian Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cilian Relief Association, because the price of rice in the city is soaring and it is not easy for the poor to find food, opened a congee distribution factory in the original location of the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road in February. The association originally planned to close the factory after two months, but it was extended due to the increasing number of poor people receiving congee. Since the factory opened, an average of about 2,000 poor people have gone to receive congee every day, but in the past few days, it has suddenly increased to about 5,000 people.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Have Been in Contact Regarding Coal Transport Vessels</h3>
<p>According to sources in the coal industry, at the beginning of this month, various coal companies in this city telegraphed to coal-producing areas such as India and Annam to order a huge amount of foreign coal, totaling about 2,500 tons. The agreed price was only about 40 to 50 yuan per ton in national currency. These purchased coal fines are now being loaded onto ships in the producing areas and are on their way to Shanghai. It is expected that they will arrive here by the end of this month at the latest. Currently, coal companies are still continuing to telegraph various coal-producing areas to order large quantities of coal fines, hoping to transport them to Shanghai to adjust the market. Therefore, the entire fuel problem in this city, without the activity of speculative coal merchants in the market, the panic seems to be a thing of the past. The reporter also inquired from various coal industry associations that the rental authorities are currently in contact with various coal companies and shipping companies to increase the frequency of coal-carrying ships. At that time, not only can the water freight be reduced, but also the source of coal fines can be increased in the future.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Health Association's Broadcast Program Today: Ms. Huang Liming Speaks on the Importance of Women's Sports</h3>
<p>The Chinese Health Association's broadcast program for this week is scheduled for 3:30 PM today. Ms. Chen Huang Liming, the director of physical education at Jinling University, will speak on the importance of women's sports in our country on Gospel Radio (call sign XMDH, frequency 760).</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Pude Association Holds Free Clinic and Medicine Distribution, Opens July 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pude Association, located at 8 Wenzhou Road at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, in view of the high prices and the difficult lives of the poor, in addition to handling winter relief last year by distributing rice and clothing, and this spring by distributing meal and porridge tickets, the poor people benefited a lot, and the cost was nearly 50,000 yuan. The association's charity work has been very successful. Without the enthusiastic donations from major philanthropists, it would not have been possible to achieve this. Now, in the summer, in view of the suffering of the poor and sick, a free clinic and medicine distribution will be held. The seventh board meeting resolved to open the clinic on July 1st to help the poor and sick. It is reported that the association is currently preparing to ensure that the clinic opens on time.</p>
<h3>Distribution Method of the Chinese Gazette</h3>
<p>According to a notice from the Public Works Department, the current method of distributing the Chinese Gazette monthly has been cancelled. In the future, Chinese taxpayers within the concession who wish to obtain this gazette should send a letter to the General Office of this Bureau with their name and address before July 15th. However, the envelope should be marked with the words "Chinese Gazette". In addition, the bureau's Chinese annual report for last year has been compiled and printed. Chinese taxpayers who wish to obtain a copy may send a letter to the General Office of the Bureau for verification and issuance. The envelope should also be marked with the words "Chinese Annual Report".</p>

<h3>The Case of the Assassination of Regiment Commander Xie of the Lone Army Camp: The Interrogation is Clear, Sentencing is Scheduled; Hao Jingcheng Repeatedly Violated Laws and Discipline and Was Detained for More Than a Month; The Case of Premeditated Possession of Murder Weapons and Rebellion is Clear</h3>
<p>Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army Camp was suddenly stabbed to death by his subordinates with sharp blades while training soldiers for morning exercises at around 5 AM on April 24th of this year. Regiment Deputy Shangguan Zhibiao was also stabbed five times while trying to save Regiment Commander Xie, but fortunately, the injuries were not fatal and he has recovered. At that time, the police authorities of the Public Concession, together with senior officers of the Lone Army Camp, investigated and detained ten suspected soldiers: Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Guochun, You Yaoliang, Zhang Wenqing, Zhou Shaoshan, Zhang Baosheng, Huang Yunqing, Cao Mingzhong, Zhang Fuzhong, and Jiang Shaoqing. Three sharp knives were found on Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Guochun, and Zhang Wenqing, and an iron bar was found on You Yaoliang. They were taken to the police station and the Special First Court approved their detention. After a long period of investigation, based on the information obtained from each person, they were all suspected of involvement in the assassination of Regiment Commander Xie. Therefore, they were formally prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>The Case is Serious, Public Attendance is Prohibited</p>
<p>On the 27th of last month, Judge Jiang conducted a special interrogation. Because the case was important, he ordered that public attendance be prohibited. Only witnesses related to the case, Chinese and Western detectives handling the case, and defense lawyers were allowed to enter the court. No one else, including newspaper reporters, was allowed to enter the court. After detailed interrogation, most of the confessions of the defendants were clarified and they were ordered to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing. At 2:30 PM yesterday, the case was continued. Spectators were still prohibited. However, reporters were specially allowed to attend the court. The Lone Army Camp was represented by Regiment Deputy Shangguan Zhibiao, who led witnesses Dang Rongjie, Wang Wenchuan, and Deng Tao to testify. The defendants were assigned lawyers Zhong Weiren and Tang Ying to provide free legal defense.</p>
<p>Regiment Deputy Recovers from Injury, Testifies in Court</p>
<p>First, the prosecutor from the Legal Department of the Public Works Department stated that there were no new developments in the case since the rescheduling. The court then called witness Dang Rongjie to reiterate his previous testimony. According to Dang's testimony, when Regiment Commander Xie was assassinated, I went forward to protect him and saw defendant Zhou Shaoshan punching me in the back. Another defendant, Zhang Guochun, was holding a sharp blade, and I went forward to snatch it, resulting in an injury to my right hand. I also saw Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Guochun, You Yaoliang, and Zhang Wenqing all holding weapons. Zhou Shaoshan denied attacking Shangguan Zhibiao. Then, according to witness Wang Wenchuan's testimony, when I was rescuing Regiment Commander Xie, defendant Zhang Fuzhong was also punching me in the back. At that time, Regiment Commander Xie had already been injured and fell to the ground. Hao Jingcheng's hands and the knife he was holding were covered in blood.</p>
<p>Disorderly Scene, Mistakenly Identifying the Assailant</p>
<p>Zhang Fuzhong admitted to punching Wang Wenchuan, saying that because the scene was disorderly at that time, the regiment commander was injured, and hundreds of people in the team were shouting and surrounding the area. I didn't know who the assailant was, and to save the regiment commander, I mistakenly identified Wang as a bad person and hit him. According to witness Deng Tao, after I joined the Lone Army Camp, I bought a knife and hid it under my bed. However, because Zhang Fuzhong's bed was next to mine, Zhang secretly took the knife without my knowledge until after the regiment commander was assassinated. Zhang Fuzhong admitted that he stole Deng's knife after April 10th and handed it over to Zhou Shaoshan, but Zhou handed it over to Zhang Guochun. I don't know the details. Zhou Shaoshan admitted that Zhang Fuzhong gave him a knife, which was later tricked away by Zhang Guochun.</p>
<p>Repeated Offenses, Held a Grudge After Being Reprimanded</p>
<p>According to Shangguan Zhibiao, Hao Jingcheng was detained for more than a month for writing anonymous letters and damaging the reputation of the regiment commander. Two or three days before Regiment Commander Xie was assassinated, Hao was discovered stealing food from the kitchen and beat up the person in charge when he refused to accept the punishment. As a result, the regiment commander whipped him with a cane. The defendant held a grudge and suddenly launched the assassination. I was rescuing the regiment commander at the time when defendant Zhang Guochun stabbed me with a knife, causing five injuries, which have now healed.</p>
<p>Hao Jingcheng Confesses</p>
<p>That since he joined the Lone Army Camp, he had been subjected to various poor treatments by the regiment commander, including insufficient food and frequent whippings. All the donations from the outside world were not made public. He had written anonymous letters asking the regiment commander to improve the treatment, but the regiment commander not only did not listen, but also detained me for two months, causing extreme anger. That morning, during morning exercises, I was late and the regiment commander severely questioned and punished me with a military stick. I couldn't bear it any longer, so I pulled out the pre-hidden dagger and stabbed him randomly. I don't know how many times I stabbed him. The knife was brought with me when I withdrew from the Four Banks Warehouse.</p>
<p>Zhang Guochun Confesses</p>
<p>That his sharp knife was taken from Zhou Shaoshan. I got it on April 13th. I also got into a fight with the squad leader for secretly eating food and was severely beaten by the regiment commander with a cane. But since I ate military rations, I should be subject to military law, and I had no resentment in my heart. I did not participate in the assassination of the regiment commander. The reason why I had a sharp weapon was because the treatment in the Lone Army Camp was too harsh. I discussed with Zhou Shaoshan, Zhang Baosheng, Zhang Fuzhong, and others to escape privately, fearing that we would be stopped, so we secretly hid sharp weapons on our bodies. At that time, when the regiment commander was assassinated, Regiment Deputy Shangguan came to the rescue. I happened to be carrying a sharp weapon. Because he usually abused the soldiers, most of his subordinates were dissatisfied with the regiment deputy, and in a moment of anger, stabbed him, but had no intention of killing him.</p>
<p>You Yaoliang Confesses</p>
<p>That his iron bar was picked up after the fact. Because after Hao Jingcheng stabbed the regiment commander, there was a sudden disturbance in the regiment. I was afraid that some unscrupulous elements from the outside would rush in, so I went back to my room to get the iron bar for defense.</p>
<p>Zhou Shaoshan Confesses</p>
<p>That there was no prior discussion about killing the regiment commander. I only talked to Zhang Guochun about wanting to escape the barbed wire and leave the Lone Army Camp. Because Zhang Guochun was tall and strong, I gave him a knife to prepare for covering our retreat during the escape.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing Confesses</p>
<p>That the knife was given to me by Zhang Guochun at 10:30 the night before, instructing me to assassinate the regiment commander, but I was reluctant. However, forced by Zhang's threat, I pretended to agree. When the regiment commander was assassinated, I did not bring a knife. Afterwards, I was afraid that Zhang Guochun would find out and be unfavorable to me, so I hurried back to my room to get a knife to confuse Zhang's suspicion and protect my own life. Zhang Baosheng, Huang Yunqing, and Cao Mingde all gave vague confessions, saying they were unaware.</p>
<p>Zhang Fuzhong Confesses</p>
<p>That Hao Jingcheng had the intention of assassinating the regiment commander several months ago, but I strongly dissuaded him and advised him not to commit a crime against his superior. I was completely unaware of this incident. When questioned,</p>
<p>Jiang Shaoqing Confesses</p>
<p>That he absolutely does not admit to knowing anything, and said that if he was aware, he would accept the most severe punishment. The court, finding the facts of the case clear, ordered the debate to begin. After mutual debate between the police prosecutor and the lawyers assigned to defend the defendants pro bono, the court declared the debate in the case concluded and scheduled the sentencing. The defendants were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>The Final Victory of the Democratic Countries is Approaching: Mr. Morley Elaborates on the Situation of the Week</h3>
<p>Mr. Morley of the Information Office of the British Embassy broadcasted a weekly current affairs report on XODN radio last night, stating that the most noteworthy news in the past two days is the signing of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty and the tension in German-Soviet relations. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union decides to protect Ukraine and the Caucasus, or whether the Nazis will obtain their demands without bloodshed, Hitler and his party's ambition to invade has been completely exposed.</p>
<p>German-Turkish Friendship is Not Very Reliable</p>
<p>Speaking of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty, although it is something Germany has been thirsting for, are Germany's guarantees reliable? It is certainly well known in Ankara that when the Nazis use Turkey as a military base, Turkey will undoubtedly rise up and resist. Currently, the Nazis are still blocked by Syria on the ground, which is beneficial to the British Empire. The attitude of Soviet Russia is still ambiguous. According to Mr. Morley, the general war situation last week was in favor of Britain. First, we will gradually advance into Syria. Second, the expanded tank patrol area on the Egyptian-Libyan border. Third, the active increase in the strength of the Royal Air Force. The Royal Air Force is active in Abyssinia, Syria, and North Africa, and the Nazi Air Force suffered significant losses last week.</p>
<p>America's Actions are Becoming More and More Obvious</p>
<p>Fourth, the United States' freezing of Axis funds and closing of German consulates and news agencies in the United States is one of the most important measures to combat the Axis powers. This is the first time that the United States has taken action to guarantee Britain's victory. Fifth, we still have the upper hand in the Atlantic war. Another German pocket battleship was sunk by our aerial torpedoes off the coast of Norway. Many German warships were hit and German and Italian ships were sunk in the port of Brest. According to him, the final victory of the democratic countries is getting closer and closer. US Secretary of the Navy Knox said in a broadcast to Canada, "Free people should protect their way of life," which means that we should work hard to eliminate the threat to human freedom, which we have obtained with so much hardship.</p>
<p>Ding Yanyong, Ni Yide, Guan Zilan and other famous artists, together with many modern young Western painters, have put on display more than 130 new works at the Daxin Gallery. Mr. Ding's beautiful colors, careful composition, and strong brushwork vividly express his vibrant life. Mr. Guan Liang's exhibits, although only three pieces, immediately reveal that his painting has reached the stage of pure mastery. Ms. Guan Zilan has long been a famous artist beloved by the world. Her colors are as bright as her personality. Whether it is portraits, landscapes, or flowers and fruits, they are all extremely bright and have a charming magic. Mr. Ni's exhibits are also all works of effort. In short, the only feature of this exhibition is that it is modern and that each artist can do their best to display the strong strength of the Chinese people in the art field. The picture on the left is Mr. Ding Yanyong's work "Fish".</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Streetcar Fire Has Been Found: Celluloid Buttons Caught Fire and Burned; The Owner of the Huaxing Button Factory Was Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>At about 3 PM on the 19th of last month, a Public Concession Route 16 trackless streetcar was traveling to Carter Road and Shanhaiguan Road when a fire suddenly broke out in the third-class carriage. More than 30 passengers were killed or injured on the spot. After the incident, all sectors of society believed that the streetcar fire was a novelty, so they unanimously criticized it. Now, after investigation by the reporter of the news agency, the police have found out the truth of the case and arrested a major criminal. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Strict Investigation</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the incident, streetcar No. 84 on that route was traveling from Caojiadu when it suddenly caught fire in the third-class carriage at Carter Road and Shanhaiguan Road at 3:10 PM. There was a loud bang, and the entire streetcar was engulfed in flames. For a time, male and female passengers had nowhere to escape, resulting in four men and women being burned to death, nine seriously injured, and eighteen slightly injured. The streetcar was completely burned into an iron shell. Afterwards, the Public Concession Police attached great importance to the tragic case and asked experts to study the sudden fire. After carefully inspecting the remains of the streetcar, a sulfurous smell was detected. At first, it was thought that it might have been caused by a sulfur bomb, so the Huishi Police Station was tasked with continuing the investigation to find out the truth.</p>
<p>Smoking Caused the Disaster</p>
<p>Feng Baishun, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the Huishi Police Station, Deputy Chief Huang Fusheng, and Detective Liang Yuliang investigated in all directions, and it was not until a few days ago that the truth was fully understood. The sudden outbreak of the fire was caused by Ni Jikang (28 years old), the owner of the Huaxing Button Factory at No. 143, Lane 87, Connaught Road, who was from Wuxi. The factory usually produces celluloid overcoat buttons. Before the tragedy occurred, Yongyu Zhuang on Jixiang Street in the French Concession asked the factory to customize some overcoat buttons. On that day, Ni bundled the finished buttons into a large package and boarded the streetcar on Connaught Road. He entered the third-class carriage, placed the package at his feet, and smoked a paper cigarette madly.</p>
<p>The Culprit is Arrested</p>
<p>When the streetcar passed the scene of the accident, Ni's cigarette had already been smoked to the butt. At that time, he threw it down casually and leaned against the window to chat idly. He did not know that the sparks had fallen into the package. As a result, the celluloid buttons caught fire and burned suddenly, and the entire streetcar was engulfed in flames. Ni fled in panic. When the streetcar stopped, he was the first to jump down and flee far away without a trace. However, Ni knew that he had caused the disaster, so he hurried home to prepare everything and fled back to his hometown. It was not until a few days ago that he thought that this matter, which was unknown to gods and ghosts, would never be discovered. He returned to Shanghai and went back to the factory. Unexpectedly, the case had been discovered by the police authorities. Chief Inspector Feng and others disguised themselves and guarded the entrance of Ni's factory at 8 AM yesterday. When Ni went out, he was arrested. He is still under investigation and will be sent to court for trial.</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens Reappear in West Shanghai: Four New Gambling Venues Open; The Special Police Department Will Investigate in Detail</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that after the gambling dens in the area of roads outside the West Shanghai Concession were banned and closed, four new gambling venues opened last night (the 19th), less than three weeks later. One is in the Argentina nightclub, one is on the old site of Yu Yuan Road, and the other two are on Haig Road and Avenue Haig. The people in the Argentina nightclub openly admitted this morning (the 20th) that they had opened a gambling business last night and stated that they had obtained a permit. As for who gave this permit, it was not clear. Pan Da of the Shanghai West Special Police Department claimed this morning that he had not received a report of the opening of new gambling venues in the West District, but he would not allow gambling dens to exist in the West District. If there were any who opened them, they would be sealed up. It is said that the four newly opened gambling venues have obtained licenses, but Pan Da said that he knew nothing about the licenses. In short, gambling dens and other criminal venues will not be allowed to operate in the West District. A detailed investigation will be conducted into the opening of the four new gambling venues. It is reported that Pan Da ordered all gambling venues in the West District to close their doors at the end of May. As a result, six large gambling venues and fifteen small gambling venues were closed on May 31st. The gambling tables in the French Club and the Italian Club have also been suspended.</p>

He bled profusely and fainted in a pool of blood. After being discovered by the Wang family, a police car was quickly called to send him to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Divorce</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>Some couples who "finally become family" occasionally have disagreements and conflicts of opinion, and they start talking about divorce, especially some young people who are actually half-baked but consider themselves "modern," and are more likely to suffer from this problem.</p>
<p>Is divorce really a good medicine for treating marital discord? Not necessarily!</p>
<p>Recently, an American survey of women who have been divorced for more than five years regarding their opinions on divorce has yielded some interesting and unexpected findings. Among them, 50% expressed regret for their hasty divorce, believing that if they encountered the same problem again today, they would not divorce their husbands. 34% expressed happiness about the divorce. And 16% have "reunited" with their husbands.</p>
<p>These facts prove that divorce is not a panacea for treating marital diseases.</p>
<p>I am not against the divorce system. For some "hopeless" couples, divorce is indeed as refreshing and necessary as removing a cancerous sore. However, I am against people who treat marriage as a child's play, have no ability to tolerate and adapt in marital life, and treat divorce as a common occurrence.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about divorce, I hope you think calmly about "is it worth doing it this way?"</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<h3>Two Sexes Life</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Yun is about to be a bride, and she is filled with joy and vivacity all day long.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a precious period, the so-called "one joy in life," this is the pinnacle of happiness.</p>
<p>She often asks me about many things after marriage, especially about dealing with her husband. Judging from her expression, she seems very eager to research some kind of "husband-taming technique." At the very least, she has considerable plans for her future ideal family.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that Yun's ideal can be "fulfilled," but I cannot be sure of her ideal, because married life is definitely not as mysterious as imagined in girlhood. On the contrary, it is an extremely ordinary matter. The problem lies in how you make this "ordinary" two-sexes life mysterious and meaningful. The success of marriage lies here, and the failure of marriage also lies here!</p>
<p>For example, Qiong—Yun's lover—has a handsome demeanor, a sharp suit, paired with a bright necktie, speaks so softly, is so humble, and understands every thought of Yun! In the deepest part of her heart, Yun praises him with a sentence: "Qiong is a hero!"</p>
<p>And Yun, who can compare with her beauty? Especially her two loving dimples, which make her worthy of pride!—"An angel," Qiong has publicly praised!</p>
<p>Wait until they get married! Honeymoon! Living together! Or after the "hundredth-day anniversary"! I can guarantee that Qiong is not a hero, and Yun is not an angel!</p>
<p>You will see what a sloppy and rough person Qiong is, unwilling to change his smelly undershirt; when going to the office, he often forgets to bring his watch; you ask him to come back for dinner, but he is always late! Even, he can sit on the toilet for an hour reading the newspaper.</p>
<p>You will also see Yun, not like before, constantly saying "Dear John," wearing a wrinkled cheongsam, with a sallow face, looking rather ugly, what beauty?</p>
<p>Previously, they both wore sunglasses, feeling that the other was an extraordinary person, but now that the shadows are gone, their eyes are particularly bright, seeing nothing but "flaws and shortcomings" in the other—from the South Pole to the North Pole.</p>
<p>So I told Yun:</p>
<p>"Don't overestimate Qiong too much, and don't be too conceited yourself. All ideals above the standard will fall below the standard.</p>
<p>"The two-sexes life is realistic, so no one can deal with the other with 'methods' or 'pretenses'! Don't you see how Western couples are intimately cheesy in the park, but still have big fights at home? The increase in divorce cases in cities is mostly due to wanting to use some 'preconceived plans.'</p>
<p>"I am not advising you to sell yourself and completely become Qiong's accessory, but you have to find ways to learn how to harmonize with everything about Qiong, as a big family is a single unit that cannot accommodate two kinds of cells.</p>
<p>'…'"</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) A Strange Peasant</p>
<p>He took down a small leather suitcase stacked on top of the cabinet. By the dim yellow light, he began putting the things he would need for the trip into the suitcase.</p>
<p>For someone who hasn't left home for several years, of course, it can't be done with just a small leather suitcase when leaving; he first had to explain things at home to his uncle, and he also had to say a few words to the nanny who was already preparing to "fly away when well-fed."</p>
<p>"Since you have decided to go back, of course, I can't stop you." He held Little Mei Bao in his arms, looking at the Wang Si couple and said, "But this child is still small, at least until I return from Beijing, there must be someone to take care of her. Can you stay for another month before leaving?"</p>
<p>The more polite the master was, the more embarrassed the nanny felt.</p>
<p>"We'll do as you say, Master!" Wang Si couldn't help but blush and smiled unnaturally.</p>
<p>After the matters at home were arranged properly, the only two difficult problems that remained to be solved before leaving were: first, should he wear short clothes or long clothes, and second, should he cover his face with gauze again? Because he couldn't solve it himself for a while, he specifically went to his uncle and cousin to discuss, and everyone discussed it for two full hours as if they were preparing for some wedding or funeral. Regarding the first question, his uncle thought that although he had been a farmer for four or five years, his actions still seemed very refined, and he was carrying such a new-style leather suitcase, wearing short clothes was indeed a bit inappropriate. Qiu Haitang himself and Wu Da also felt that Old Master Wu was right, so without spending much time hesitating, they unanimously decided that he should wear long clothes. (138)</p>

<h3>Sunshade Eyeglasses with Curtains</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>In this season of scorching sun, clusters of black sunshades have hit the market one after another. When you look on the road, there are two black dots here and two black dots there, which is rather amusing. However, abroad, this kind of dark eyewear is no longer fashionable now.</p>
<p>Recently, foreign opticians, with a flight of fancy, have installed a row of curtains on the upper part of the eyeglasses, the function of which is not much different from the bamboo curtains on summer windows. This kind of sunshade eyewear, for shielding sunlight shining down from above, has the same effect as completely black eyewear, but people wearing this kind of curtained eyewear can avoid their vision being affected. The curtains of this kind of eyewear either use a liquid injected into the eyeglasses, or are made of metal threads intertwined.</p>
<p>I really think: Yun and Qiong are two polygonal pebbles, watching how they rub against each other, bother each other, and bump into each other, until they both become smooth stone bullets! At that time, they will know:</p>
<p>True family happiness comes from experience, and ideals cannot be built!</p>

<h3>Road</h3>
<p>— Kai Lei</p>
<p>I say we are all travelers carrying heavy baggage.</p>
<p>Ever since our benevolent mother brought us into this world, we have been carrying that baggage. It's just that at that time, our beloved parents held our hands and accompanied us on our journey, so we didn't feel its existence.</p>
<p>But now is now after all. Looking in the imaginary large mirror, I know that my age has indeed reached twenty, and I have even participated in the high school graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>Then, I quietly heard my father's voice: "Child, you choose your own path." I also heard my mother's earnest wish: "From now on, it is your time to walk the road yourself; be careful, child!"</p>
<p>From then on, I realized my own burden.</p>
<p>However, I do not feel the slightest regret for this. I once swore to the stars in a quiet late night. I said that I would replace the guidance of my parents in the past with my own bright, torch-like eyes, and I would also shoulder the baggage on my shoulders with my own twenty years of strength.</p>
<p>Now, finally, many roads are lying in front of me.</p>
<p>I have the pride of my twentieth spring, I have the determination that every young person possesses, and with bright, torch-like eyes and resolute steps, I have embarked on the road that I feel I should take. That is to say, I have chosen my future journey and decided the direction of my future life.</p>
<p>Let those whose scalps have been smoothed by worldliness laugh, let stubborn and simple people criticize, just as a sincere friend wrote in a letter: "I am me, I have confidence, even if the exit of this road is narrow, it doesn't matter. I only choose what is close to my nature to learn and research, I can't control other people's shaking their heads and sarcasm."</p>
<p>For me, I feel that the "road" itself has nothing to do with "wide" or "narrow"; the road is just "road" after all. To reach that beautiful place that is always on my mind, every "road" is actually a shortcut. The difference is that the "road" has its own unique nature, and we must adapt to it, which lies in your own individual interests and endless efforts.</p>
<p>We must kick away the concept of the "width," "narrowness," "smoothness," and "obstruction" of the "road," and use our own personality and combine our efforts to walk the "road," then the light we are looking forward to will approach our eyes day by day!</p>

<h3>Western Film Selections "New Journey to the West"</h3>
<p>— Chen Sen</p>
<p>Episode 0 "Sky High Ridge" Three Heroes Gather "Giant Valley" Two Heroines Clash</p>
<p>It is said that in "Flower and Fruit Mountain," "New Water Curtain Cave," there is a "man-demon" called "Tarzan the Ape-Man," born in the "Primeval Era," who once studied under "Fairy Hibiscus," received the "invisibility spell," and cultivated an "invincible" body, comparable to the ancient "Faust," and can "ride the clouds and mist" and "fly" freely. He is usually eager to help others and "impartial." He once became "heroic lovers" with "one hundred robbery heroes" and "Red Flower Knight." The latter is famous for singing the "Red Flower Song," and is also an "unconventional knight."</p>
<p>At the time, there was an "Iron Man" called "Kong Ge Ting" from "Samarang," originally a "barbarian prince," quite with the "courage of a tiger," but not the "demeanor of a celebrity." He was born "head and shoulders above the crowd," a handsome "beautiful boy," and was very popular with women, and formed a "foreign love" with "Snow White" of "San Francisco." This "young lady" was indeed a "golden branch and jade leaf," and had a "nation-toppling" appearance. She could be called a "hero matches beauty," complementing each other, and after "marriage," the couple often lived by the sea and swam, and the harmonious love between them was like a "paradise on earth." Who knew that "Cupid" would play tricks, and suddenly there were "waves in the sea of love," because his wife was robbed by the "romantic robber" "Rouge Tiger" and hidden in the "Charming Cave." The "Iron Man" received the news, and followed her trail to the "tiger's den to snatch back the beauty." But his wife had already "destroyed her integrity and fulfilled her loyalty." In the "light of swords and shadows," the "old maid and the beauty" "returned to the great hatred" at the same time. From then on, the "dream of the rest of the valley" was broken, and they were separated by "heaven and earth," and the "charming bones in the desolate forest" became "lovesickness of red beans." As the saying goes, "the hatred of peach blossoms is continuous," and "casting love" is ultimately vain. The "Iron Man" looked back on the past, and suddenly felt that the "earth" was vast, and he was like a "wanderer at the end of the sea." Moreover, the thoughts of "returning to the raft in the sea of desire" and "taking advantage of his wife's wealth" were all gone, so he shaved his hair and became a monk, calling himself "Flower Monk." From then on, "the sea was wide and the sky was vast," "wealth was floating clouds," he jumped out of the "prison of love," and was not tainted by the "three desires," and lived in seclusion in the "Eden Paradise" of "Morocco" to spend his "angry remaining life."</p>
<p>One day, "Tarzan the Ape-Man" and the "Red Flower Knight" happened to pass by "Sky High Ridge," and met the "Flower Monk." They were all "heroes in troubled times," and could not help but "fall in love at first sight," so they formed a "dragon and tiger situation" and imitated the feat of the "Three Musketeers," traveling through "ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers," westward to "Water and Fire Island," to seek the "Moon Palace Treasure Box" and the rare "ruby." So they rode "iron horses" and set off together. Along the way, they only saw "green mountains and red powder," "peach blossoms and plums fragrant," could not see the end of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," strange birds and "monsters," and the "red apricots on the branches" were like "gold everywhere." Sometimes they "rode the wind and waves" and subdued the "black sea mermaids," and sometimes they "explored ancient tombs," leaving "traces of swords everywhere." At that time, they passed through the "Gate of Beauty," which was the jurisdiction of the "Country of All Fragrances." The queen was called "Camellia Girl," and her land was full of "pearls and shadows," and the people were all "women." At that time, there was a "rouge robber" "One Zhang Qing" who occupied "New Gold Mountain" as a bandit, and her subordinates were generals such as "Black Spider," "Thunder," "Little Overlord," and "Living Yama," all of whom were "leaders of the green forest," known as the "Four Heavenly Kings." Because of coveting the "beautiful mountains and rivers," the "Iron Cavalry of Yu City" roamed around, and the "iron hooves and wolf smoke" rose up. But the king was unwilling to submit, so he supervised the "Flying Cavalry General" and the "Freedom Fighters," and fought a great battle in "Giant Valley." But it could be seen that there was "war music in the battlefield" and "blood staining the mountains and rivers." As a result, "blood was shed in the golden palace" and the "queen died for her country." "One Zhang Qing" became the "king of traitors," and commanded the "Western Front Iron Army." Although he could not "be remembered forever," he was still a "hero of the age!" Who would have thought that "the way of heaven is difficult to tolerate," and the souls of martyrs died in vain, and "Tarzan the Ape-Man" and others were taught by heaven to "kill traitors and avenge," and to become "revolutionary pioneers," showing the "dignity of military training." It is truly said:</p>
<p>The affair of "Western Strange Lust" is long,</p>
<p>The "South Sea Desire Tide" rises sharply;</p>
<p>The day when "Philippine Wilderness Robbery Treasure" succeeds,</p>
<p>"After the rain, the sky clears," "Full Court Fragrance."</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Valiant Posture Comes to Fierce Battle</p>
<p>So the bandits really have no movements as the scouts said? Actually, that's not the case. Since the bandits failed to cross the river that day and suffered a defeat, Li Zicheng was furious and said to his subordinates: "Since we entered Shanxi, we have won every battle, but how did we lose to Zhou Yuji? I think that Zhou must also be a person, and he is not born with three heads and six arms. The soldiers and horses in Daizhou will definitely not be as many as in Taiyuan. Taiyuan can be captured, so can Daizhou not be captured?" He was about to attack with all his forces, but his military advisor Niu Jinxing said: "Zhou Yuji is originally a general, in charge of Daizhou and Ningwu, and has a famous name early on. He is not comparable to mediocre generations. Our army was intercepted as soon as we crossed the river, which shows that the defenses there are very strict, not allowing us to cross the river safely. We might as well pretend to stay still on the surface to relax their military hearts. After a few days, we can advance at night and attack them unprepared. I have already found out that the water in Chenjiadu, the upper reaches of the Xiaolong River, is shallow and easy to cross. It is better to send a team of elite troops there to cross secretly and attack from the rear. At the same time, gather ships tightly and cross at night from the lower reaches. Send another branch of troops to pretend to attack in front, so that they do not pay attention to other places and mislead them in many ways." Li Zicheng said happily: "With such an attack, we are not afraid that Zhou Yuji's subordinates will be powerful." So he acted according to Niu Jinxing's plan. That night, Wang Yongtai sat alone in the central army tent, listening to the sound of the sentinel outside, which was very peaceful, but the wild wind was very strong and rustling. By the third watch, he still did not dare to go to bed. Suddenly, he heard the sound of drums on the opposite side of the Xiaolong River, and his heart could not help but be shocked. He thought to himself, are the bandits really coming to attack at night? He couldn't let them cross the river. So he personally went out of the tent and gathered archers to the river to monitor the bandits and prevent them from crossing the river. That night, the moon was dark and the wind was high. Looking at the opposite bank, it was pitch black and there was no fire. The sound of drums was thumping non-stop. Wang Yongtai taught his cavalry to line up in the form of a word-wise snake array, waiting for the fight, but he did not see a single bandit crossing the river. He thought to himself that the bandits must be deliberately using a suspicious soldier's plan and secretly crossing elsewhere? So he ordered people to go to Chenjiadu to inquire about what emergency Xu Jing had. But the scouts did not go far, and Xu Jing had already retreated. (95)</p>
<h3>Vainly Spent Youth</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>The literary film Vainly Spent Youth (Back Street), starring Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan, is based on the novel by Fannie Hurst. The background of this film is the United States 50 years ago. The various things at that time are very interesting to look at now.</p>
<p>According to numerical records, in 1890, the entire United States had a population of only 76 million, and the number of cars was only 80 in the country. The two old-fashioned cars used in the film had been advertised for four months before they were found. Much thought was also spent on the costumes of the actresses, because the stockings worn had to be from the 1890s, and there were only 14,000 pairs in the entire United States, so they had to be requested with heavy money. Statistics like these totaled 12,000. Now the final version of the film is scheduled to be shown at the Cathay Theater from the 26th of this month.</p>
