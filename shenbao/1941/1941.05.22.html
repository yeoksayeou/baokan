<h3 id="c11">國際現勢概觀 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>英軍甫在伊拉克展開攻勢，德傘兵又突向蒙塵中的希臘政府所在地克里特攻襲，第一批的一千五百名德軍，雖不久即泰半就殲，第二批的傘兵三千人又繼續降落，到屬稿時止仍在繼續苦戰中。克里特島人煙寥落，防務不足，是利於傘兵行動的條件，不過，在當地却不會得到第五縱隊的有力響應，有如前此之於荷蘭。如果守軍能以充分實力鎭靜應付，英機史能迅謀控制天空，則去年此際的一慕痛史也許不致重演於希臘的最後一塊領土。德方這一步驟，如果說是作侵英的試騐，那並小足重視，因爲英倫三島的一切斷非克里特島所可比擬，德軍在此役所獲經騐，必難同樣適用於英倫，另一方面，到適足顯示德方對於東地中海的重視，不容在希臘半島愛琴羣島以至杜的坎尼斯羣島的近側被英方挿進一把七首，同時這又是在謀肅淸其東進的路綫。</p>
<p>不過近東一隅，總不是德方對付英國最有利的戰塲，就目前形勢來看，攫取英國油田與切斷蘇彝士運河都非一蹴可及，阿比西尼亞義最後守軍的投降已給予英方更多軍事運用上的便利，除非國際間再發生其他重大變化，例如蘇土改變態度之類，總難設想德國竟能輕易獲得何等有決定性的進展，到是大西洋和遠東方面，最近形勢更顯得動盪和微妙。達爾郞與德方談判的內容，至今未見公佈，但可斷言維希所作讓步絕非輕微，德軍在叙利亞所獲的便利、不過是决要的一端而已。固然，法國絕無對英作戰的實力與可能，德力也知道如果這迫維希過甚，適無異於縊斃其生命，且間接助長了特戈爾一派的聲勢，不過有如關於利用若干重要軍事根據地的讓步，以至給予德軍更多的作戰協力和幫助，都已無可諱言，無論維希如何聲辯，她總是要從助德擊敗英國一個前途之中去求生路，貝當達爾郞之流不足責，這命運其實是從貢比臬一慕早已注定了的。連日英美都已因此感到莫大激動，其對維希政府關係亦已不絕如縷，但在實際行動上似至今尙未確定應付步驟。叙利亞問題已使英國在近東頗受困擾，假使西地中海以至北非西非再發生新的變動，則不只英國在地中海的海權岌岌可危，且更將使大西洋的風濤愈趨險惡，並轉而威脅着美洲國家的安全。李希上將和助法食糧都沒有戰勝納粹的威逼與誘惑，此後除却採取堅强斷然策略以事應付而外別無他徑可尋，同時這也就是美國參戰機運更進一步的屆近成熟。</p>
<p>在此種擾攘之中，獨有遠東局勢似頗不爲歐戰進退所影響，無髯到是別有奇詭之觀。蘇日協定並不比三國同盟獲有較好的反應，三國盟的中關於對付其他參加歐戰國家的條款，其現實的價値也無人能加以確切的把握。同時，對中國的戰事正在擴大進行中，突然又發見建議美國調停中日戰爭的試探汽球，這縱有東京方面的吾認，但是以之和日前所聞「從外交上竭力解決中國事變」的話相對照，似乎也不是絕對的不可思議吧！目前歐戰所加於美國的影響，自然足以引起一種幻想，認爲美國之接近參戰邊沿，必會减輕其對於遠東的關切，如果能乘此時機力袪美方疑念，當能換得美國的某種讓步，這也就是最近不斷發爲種種姿態的主因，至於另一方面的强硬聲調，固然可能是與此相配合着的姿態，也可能是根本代表着反對者的見解；而日來其種種見解議論的龐雜紛歧，又適足證明其不但對外不會獲得何等有效的反應，即在內部亦復缺少一致的觀點與信心。</p>

<h3 id="c37">德國政治警察　控制下的義大利 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>這篇是美國Christian　Science　Monitor駐羅馬訪員臺維　返國後所作的另一篇報告，茲迻譯如下：</p>
<p>義大利的通都大邑多半已在德國的政治警察控制之中。墨索里尼的用意原在利用他們鎭壓國內的革命陰謀。</p>
<p>本年二月下旬，記者離開羅馬之時，德方控制義國的計劃，大體已吿完成。他們的策略簡單有效，在暗地裹進行，義大利人都如蒙在鼓裹。他們借着技術的名目，源源不絕地派遣政治顧問，行政專家，經濟調整家，軍事考察團及政治警察，前來活動。迨至義大利軍隊在菲洲屢戰皆北，德國政治警察乃派遣大批人員，分駐義國政府各部，研究鎮壓叛變的步驟。本年一二月之交，義國政府在戰敗空氣籠罩下愈益不振，政務幾致停頓，德方就從容取而代之了。</p>
<p>記者在去年十一月初頭，即已發覺這種無形的佔領。當時有一隊德國政治警察駐紮在維密那爾宮，即內政部所在地。據聞他們的使命，在支持義國政治警察隊中的親德派，以對付反德的溫和派。</p>
<p>義國政治警察局長巴基尼是個色厲內荏的人物，對於這種情形極爲焦慮。一天，他向一個知己朋友說道，「我現在維持一天算一天。一朝維持不了，唯有退讓德人大權獨攬了。」</p>
<p>這是十一月初頭的事，迨至月底，巴基尼果然掛冠而去，聽由德國政治警察局長希墨萊的部下爲所欲爲。同時，德國大使館和德意志通訊社內部的人員也日益興旺，但新來的人，大抵無所事事。</p>
<p>大部份義大利人都注意戰事，無暇顧及內政問題，即有明眼人，也只好嘆着無能爲力。今年二月初間，羅馬有一位消息最靈通的外交家對我說，「德人的部署已經完畢，義國人民還一無所知呢。」</p>
<p>我就問他，墨索里尼本人對手下親德派的所爲，是吾覺察。他回答說「並不。」</p>
<p>以上就是一段無形革命的故事。至於德國軍隊呢，截至今年一月初爲止，僅有空軍駐紥西西利島，此外還有一兩師鐵甲化部隊也已開到該處，保護這種空軍部隊，防備英軍襲擊。直至二月初，義國內部危機日深，德國陸軍方始源源開到，但並不開到義國北部，那邊排德空氣較爲濃厚，他們逕往那波利港及西西利島，以便在各該處向特利波利港，比塞大港及非洲法國屬地方面活動。據說德軍開入義國的大的可有十八師之多。我們在羅馬的外國訪員們一時摸不着頭腦，以爲如此龐大的軍隊決不能掩飾，何况人人正討論這件事情。但我們並沒有見到這些軍隊。直到我們靜坐下來，計算德國駐在義大利的陸空軍人員的確數，纔發現這種消息並非無的放矢。</p>
<p>我們推算德國空軍在西西利島駐紮六百架飛機，用以控制西西利海峽，的需人員二萬一千名。這些人員連同配備，可以裝滿五六十列車。這是一位熟悉德國空軍組織的專家告訴我們的。</p>
<p>在維馬的德國人說，德義兩國軍隊不宜混合，德軍可以自由行動，義國方面不得從中阻礙。當時南斯拉夫方面雖盛傳米蘭發生反德運動，實際仍平靜無事。我留在義國期間，也未聽得任何地方發生嚴重的反德示威運動。德國人行動，處處小心，不欲與義國一般人以反對的口實。</p>
<p>不過德人這種策略有時也欲蓋彌彰。記者一位義國朋友曾目擊義大利人與德國軍官衝突過一决。事緣義國北部某城一家小餐館裹有三個德國軍官步入用餐。吃畢惠鈔時，中有一個軍官忽然退回帳單，要求用德文開帳。</p>
<p>店主急忙忙地把一份菜單給他過目，並用義大利語解釋價格十分公道，但這位軍官不爲所動。全堂食客都怒形於色，靜聽店中向他訴說全店無人懂得德語。</p>
<p>德國軍官大發脾氣說，「這些地方早晚就是我們的了！」</p>

<p>在主席尼柯拉斯致辭中、有謂「戰後中國雖受有不少損失、但渠深信、此後必能完全恢復原狀、而於中美兩國未來之商業關係、當可更臻密切」、尼氏又稱、「我人對於整個世界繁榮所貢獻之特殊工作、厥爲增進偉大的三民主義共和國與我祖國之商業關係、吾人之中、有長期居留遠東、而對於中美貿易有心得者、均知中美兩國、有特殊之關係、蓋兩國能有無相通彼此補足其對方之需要也、」</p>
<p>潘恩霖氏　精警演詞</p>
<p>中國旅行社社長潘恩霖氏之演說、大意謂「値此戰後交通、時虞停頓、貿易極感困難之時、吾人紀念中美貿易週、實具有極可重視之意義、目下中國對美貿易、較任何國家爲多、可知中美兩國人民、以旣具有極良好之友誼與商業關係、故能在戰爭狀態下、仍有新的發展、且足證戰爭對於貿易、時能產新的環境與意義、蓋中國若干幼稚之運輸方法及低級勞働者、今皆對中美貿易有絕大　貢獻也、戰前以運費論、每噸貨物由長江運至重慶僅需的六十元、戰後由粤漢路運往者、需二百四十元、由越南運往者、需一千元、若經滇緬路運往、則需一萬元、以路綫論、半數須通過亞洲地域、的爲三千三百英里、且運輸工具甚爲複難、載重有限、叉須人力協助、工作旣繁　、復因空襲關係、不無損失、但中國人民、輒能以艱苦耐勞之犧牲精神、克服此種困難此則在吾人紀念中美貿易週時、應特別加以讚揚、並籲請美國人士、應予以熱烈之支援者、現時內地已有廣大之人力、與豐富之物產、交通亦已較戰事初期爲便利、故中美貿易之基本條件、業已具備、因此吾人可以深信中美兩國間之貿易、將來必有更大之發展」、</p>

<p>蘇參贊高爾特氏演說、首述本年度上海進口貿易、已大見增加、但我人必須注意者、其中一部份實用品、實可以中國貨代之、蓋以外國貨代中國貨、並非良好現象也、關於美國貨物運華、頗有困難、高氏亦有說明、據稱、美國以積極擴大軍備、乃致其他方面之生產、不無受有阻滯、例如鋼鐵、就目前最大之產量、爲每年八千三百萬噸、然美國國內每年消耗量、則須一萬一千萬噸至一萬二千萬噸、因此美國國內各項工業生產量、現已頗感不足、上海欲購美貨、則其困難自必增加、高氏並稱、美國爲遠東方面之最好主顧、每年購買之貨物、實較諸出售於遠東者爲多、深信美國在將來當注意美國流於遠東之資源、是吾對於有關係國家人民、有所裨益、</p>

<p>— 柳</p>
<p>從一年級敎室出來，回到方纔參觀的洋房內第一層各部分去豙觀，有敎室，手工室，有聾啞班。聾啞班的學生，有的正在上國文課，亦有用筆算來學習珠算。我好奇的問，啞子能不能發音讀書，他們說：能；即在一種手勢指示之下，他居然將敎科書中文句，一句一句讀將出來，不過他的發音，較爲笨重，沒有一般人的淸晰罷了！然而啞子能開口，在以前認爲不可能，如今竟以敎育技術的發達，可以彌補天然之缺陷的了！</p>
<p>此外尙有五個部分，即爲畢業的學生習藝之所。總其成的皆是呂神父，而每一部分都有中西領十管理，並專門技師指導。那五部分是：</p>
<p>（一）圖書部：分水彩，鉛筆，油盡，彩色玻璃；</p>
<p>（二）印刷部：分石印，鉛印，五彩印；</p>
<p>（三）木工部：分製作，打樣，雕刻，油漆；</p>
<p>（四）五金部：分鍍金，鈹銀，翻砂；</p>
<p>（五）照相部：分銅版，鋅版，玻璃版；</p>
<p>我們一部分一部分參觀過去，足足費了三小時功夫，還是忽忽地參觀一過。我節取吳季札的語，作爲我參觀的結語，所謂「其蔑以加於此矣，觀止矣！」確實，工學兼施，人無棄木物無遺利，各盡其力，各得其需，假使以這一種精神，推行之於各種事業，我可說，沒有一事業不會成功的。</p>
<p>該院所出的工藝品，又沒有一樣不精良的；允共是木工部與五金部的出品，大大小小，形形色色，件件精緻，我看見來買的，大都是西人，不遠跋涉，特地跑到土山灣來買，足見製品的信用甚强，故得行銷至南洋印度及美法諸國。圖書部出品，當南洋勸業會時，得獎憑至十九件之多；又在南京國貨展覽會陳列，復得着不少獎詞。然而可稱遠東獨步的出品，允推彩色玻璃；繪上人物，經特製後，永不退色。雕刻部所陳列的各種塑像，即是我們敎堂中所看到的，在這裏一排一排的陳列着。還有徐光啟的像，紅袍紗帽，神彩生動。此外亦替人　造銅像，我曾覩有一半身像，據說即爲浦東陳姓所定製的。</p>
<p>工塲部分，本是生產事業，非但足以自給，而且工業品出售所得，占孤兒院收人中主要部分；如今不　，內地因交通阻隔，等於斷絕；國外則歐戰蔓延，銷路日微。此外所恃以開支的，則爲中西人士之捐款。</p>

<p>上日大落之紗市、昨則又復回昂、但實際生意、異常凋零、港幫僅辦五十包、其他幫口絕無生氣、然擁資充足之戶、對於二十支雙馬廠單吸收之額、絲毫不肯放棄、所以除標準紗時有起伏外、完全陷於停頓狀態中、不過多頭之議論、謂棧單籌碼緊枯、不能看鬆、至於空頭、鑒於二十支紗銷路斷乏、且雙馬價　獨高、雜牌紗出路愈狹、加之紗銷時期落令、預下前途米許樂觀、所以雙方高價爲一干四百四十七兀、低價爲一千四百二十六元、午後拉力頗强、漲至一千四百五十二元、旋聞某標準紗二十支本月份價僅一千一百七十五元收盤、與變馬比較、距離相差殊遠、盈利者吐出、及新　者奮起、跌至一千四百三十五元、最後價爲一千四百三十五六元、今日有棉紗一百廿五件運暹雜、二百七十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市情平平、但檯　上伸手者大都搶進看升、首盤價爲一千四百三十五元、少頃漲至四十三元、然賣戶未缺、又鬆至　千四百三十七元、繼聞標金回昂、徐徐上升至一千四百四十六元、然塲中氣勢、頗呈假痴假呆之局面、迨至收盤時、多頭又復活動、大都掉期、一霎間漲至一千四百四十九元、然現紗交易沉寂、查牛日間成交統計一萬〇七白五十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、香港五〇　同行一〇·七〇〇統計一〇七五〇包</p>
<p>紗價不起　棉市難期振作</p>
<p>現棉情况、因紗銷出口甚少、且售價不起、雜牌紗價格旣低、而存貨壅塞、所以棉巾亦受牽掣、不過細紗原料、市况另作別論、但交易亦不旺也、昨祇做開通州木架花二百包、價四十七元係號家對做、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、人心不振、情况蕭條、昨日有二百包高級已西棉、轉運靑島、售價僅爲四百十元左右、較之最高售價一相差十元、因之棉市於最近期內、實觀望振作也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因同業買進而漲、續後又因紐奧倫斯售出、及一部分了結略跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日的漲八九鎊音、</p>

<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>懂了寫字方法、便從簡單的繪晝、如梅蘭竹菊入手、用坊間出版的芥子園畫譜做個參攷、譬如畫蘭花必先畫葉、看淸用筆的决序自左而右、略分輕重、順手撇去、一次二次以至十决八决以後、就有把握了、畫梅花必先畫枝、自上而下、順勢畫來、方見筆力、其他畫竹畫菊、當然各有方法、蘭葉要用深墨、蘭花要淡墨、菊花用深墨、菊葉要用淡墨、深淡之中、也要變化、只要細心大胆地練習、過了幾時懂了用筆用墨的方法、然後再臨更複雜的畫稿、而在落筆以前、先要詳細研究畫稿上的筆法·章伙·意境、各方面的技巧、然後着手臨去、方有良好的結果、這種梅蘭竹菊的畫成都是綫條的組織、而綫條都出於筆端上的功夫、中國晝不論山水、人物以及花烏、都是用錢條的湊合描寫而成、綫條能够變化·活潑·老辣·沈着了、畫起來是一定好的、不過、這綫條功夫、決非一旦一夕可以成熟的、要有恒心去練習、同時也要多看名家的作品揣摩參攷、自然事半功倍了、</p>
<p>西洋書的研究、完全以寫生爲唯一的力法、但是也從簡單的入手、根據遠近·明暗·大小·透視的原理、對照了物體、用鉛筆或者木炭來描寫、做基本的練習、練熟之後、不論靜的花卉、動的走獸、或者大白然的風景、一樣樣都可以描寫了，在西洋畫的立塲來看、人體模特兒、爲最適宜的對象了、他有曲綫美、色彩美·精神美、試看面部的耳目口鼻、手足四眩、以及身腰胸背等曲綫、最多變化、皮膚的色彩、常常因爲血液的循環、受了光的反射、也最多變化、這種曲綫和色彩、人體是最豐富、尤其精神美爲人體獨具的長處、喜怒哀樂的表情、飽滿充實的精神、爲各種物體或他種動物所缺少的、因此人體寫生、爲西洋畫上最主要的基礎、應該先把人體解剖學研究、然後使輸廓可以正確、研究光學色彩學、使明暗的變化、色彩的配合、得到圓滿的收獲、等到描寫的技能成熟了、西洋繪畫的基礎、也就打定了、通常的方之、在練習人體以前、先用石膏模型做對象、初學者、可以充分窺測牠的輸廓、從局部以至全部的逐步練習、倘然連石膏模型的設備不易辦到、那末、只有和中國畫樣的臨摹範本入手、先臨鉛筆畫、然後水彩、以至於油畫、不過、臨摹只好偶然、不能視爲正軌的方法、</p>

<h3 id="c57">戰爭焦慮病 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 潘禮</p>
<p>在德　猛烈轟炸下的英國，一般民衆，雖然都表現出一種不屈不撓的精神，可是也有極少數的人民，因爲受到戰爭的威脅，而感到心理上的不安，發生一種焦慮的現象，患了輕　神經官能病。</p>
<p>這些病人一經精神病專家加以診視，即行痊愈。精神病專家所甩的業方，不過是一言兩語而已。</p>
<p>很奇怪的，這些患戰爭焦慮病的病人，多數是很想表現勇氣，生怕在人前顯示對於戰爭的　懼，面被人家恥笑的，不料因此反而產生了心理上的焦慮現象了。</p>
<p>發生對於這種病人，祇耍向他解釋戰爭原是可怖的事情，表現對於戰爭的焦慮，並不可恥，大家的心理對於戰爭的反應原是差不多的。</p>
<p>可是看淸環境，不怕正視現實是最健康的。</p>

<p>— 波浪</p>
<p>一段很長的時間，把他的影像在我的記憶上漸漸淡滅了下去。直到今天在一本書上見到他底名字時；一個碩長，瘦黃，長髮的臉，又在我底腦際洩現了出來。</p>
<p>在服友中，他是個思想嶄新的。曾輸給我不少新的智識，幾次的談話，都使我起了「向上」的慾望，他非常的增憤『禮敎』：常說：「我要征服禮敎。」</p>
<p>在一天的下午，在草塲上，我談起了我底家庭，當我結束後正沈浸在幻想的境地裹時，衹聽得他喟然地說：「你還比我幸福得多。」我驚奇地回過了臉看他。啊！我從沒見過他有過像這樣的眼光；似乎有一憂　的秘密潛伏在他眼底深處。我不禁低聲問他。</p>
<p>『你不曾想到』，他說：『永不會想到。一個人是不能單觀其日常表情的。快樂的人，心中常會吞着眼淚。你不是看見我常笑着嗎？可是絕望的烏雲常圍罩着我底心……</p>
<p>「在十二歲上的一天，那時我還是個無知的孩子。當我放學回家踏進門口時，發覺家中的人多了起來；他們都帶着輕侮的眼光，護笑地喊着『來了，來了』，我莫名地紅了臉，羞恥地向母親房內奔去，但她房內亦滿坐着女戚，亦甩同樣的眼光　着我笑。我低下了頭，心開始在激動了。</p>
<p>『從那大起，家裹便多了一個人……一個女孩子，算是我將來的妻子的童媳。她帶來了我被人作開玩笑的資料，她帶來了我在希望時現出的暗雲。我底智識一天一天地在增加，同時對將來也覺得暗黯。當我在讀書時，看見了她，我底思想開始紊亂，精神起了呻吟。覺得害沒有用，牠會把我拯救出來嗎？固然，我可以立刻不顧一切地越出這火窰。』</p>
<p>『那麼，那女孩子將有個甚麼樣的結束呢』？我夢囈地說着。</p>
<p>『是啊，也正是這問題在緾着我。我自然不能丟棄她，但將來她能給與我幸福嗎？她是個自不識丁的人呢！……我也想到去敎育她，但當我倆在一室內，甚至互相地望了一眼，都會遭受到家人甚至父母底竊笑和侮語的射　；這樣會　續幾天，你想我還能和她同案，敎她一個一個地認字嗎？』</p>
<p>『如此，除了你爲個人的反抗外，就沒有法子了？你想，縱然你是獲了勝利，那麼她呢？不是要陷人更深的地窖中去嗎？不要忘了，你還是個靑年呢！』</p>
<p>『我還是個……靑年，』他緩緩地說：『但當你被處入這境地中時，你要怎樣呢？』</p>
<p>這句話猶似一塊冰從頭頸向背上滑下去。是啊，一個靑年何處不在找機會反抗呢？他不比我想得更多的法子嗎？一股痛苦的感觸緊縛住了我底心，我不禁脫口說出：「這封建，這禮教！」</p>

<h3 id="c59">美麗 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>早上敎現代文選的先生帶來了一束玫瑰，分送每人一朶，說是五月來了呢。（一個外國女人是不會懂得中國靑年的心的。）</p>
<p>玫瑰是美盤　芬芳的，應該轉送給一位朋友，但愛花的朋友已經遠去了。</p>
<p>拿回家，我擱在桌子上，總算給這單調的屋子添了份顏色。</p>
<p>夜晚歸來，牠已經枯萎了。我暗怪自己的疏忽，爲甚麼不早揷在花瓶里呢？於是，連忙轉身去找瓶子，盛淸水；但，你知道，牠的美麗一去就不復返了。</p>
<p>我記起霍桑寫的一個故事。</p>
<p>有位怪僻的老醫生，得到了半瓶不老泉的聖水，邀請了四位老者參觀。他神奇的試騐；一朶殘碎了的玫瑰，五十五年　他行婚禮時所配帶過的，置於聖水中，竟恢復了牠久失的色澤　芬香。</p>
<p>老醫生又說，聖水也能使人返老還童，四位老者就分飲了瓶中的聖水。剎那間，他們都找回了自己的青春。他們歡呼，他們高歌，他們在舞，他們爭吵，冷落的宇宙也顯得熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>軍備</p>
<h3 id="c60">無聲機關槍 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 李義</p>
<p>美國威廉海爾及杜蘭比姆二氏，發明新式無聲機關槍一種，狀似手提機關槍，每分鐘能發子彈一萬枚。該槍因係利用空氣壓力而非以火藥放射者，故並無機關槍之軋軋聲。最近於試騐放射之時，曾將三吋厚之橡木板盤至起火，並將保護飛機之鐵中　穿網紗窗。射擊之時，槍身冰冷如恒，並不如用火藥之檢身之發熱。圖示鋼板被無聲機關槍射學彈痕纍纍情形。</p>
<p>疲倦終於也擒住了「靑年人」，他們坐下來休息了。就在這時老醫生手內的玫瑰萎謝了，片刻之後，四人的靑春也如烟雲般地消散了，他們又回到垂暮之年。</p>
<p>朋友；如你所見，玫瑰的美麗是短暫的，靑　的美麗也是短暫的。但你可知道人世間也有永生不减的美麗碼？</p>
<h3 id="c61">機械化閃電軍 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 沈雄</p>
<p>美國夏費少將（Chaffe）刻正計劃編練一支調動神　的閃　軍，作爲迎　進犯北美或南美的侵略者之思。因目前美國軍隊請　還欠迅速，譬如說　軍若在巴西奇襲登陸，美軍就有點鞭長莫及。但事實上如果眞有這件事件發生時，美軍非得能迅速開去，擊潰德軍不可，編練機械化的閃電軍就是預備以閃電戰回答閃電戰。</p>
<p>這支部隊共有七個機械化師，每師有官兵一萬人，輕坦克車二八七輛，中等坦克車一二　輛，另有其他車子一三二八輛，包括軍用卡車和機器脚踏車等。每師有機械化步工兵隊，斥堠隊，流動砲隊，飛機偵査隊。一夜間能「行軍」一百五十哩，黎明之前即可趕至迎擊敵人。</p>
<p>閃電軍之主力爲坦克，火力甚强。輕坦克（重八噸至十五）配有·三零公厘口徑　三門，·三七口徑砲一門；二十三噸重坦克裝·三七口徑砲一門，·三零口徑機關砲六門。　說到一九四一年六月這七師閃電軍就可以全部裝配，訓練完成。（按德國現有閃電軍亦七師，曾訓練六年）</p>

<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>對於別的孩子，他簡直笑也不笑。可是今天却有些古怪，他一提起梅寶，臉上便透出一種他很慈愛的笑來，爲前此所絕對沒有的；並且的臉龐的瘦削和精神的萎靡，對於秋海棠，也同樣是一件奇事，因爲這都是以前所沒有的，即使在他窮得精光的時候，也從小如此。</p>
<p>「二哥，瞧你的神氣好像也害過什麼病嗎？…</p>
<p>玉崑苦笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「放心，我決不會爲你上什麼心事！倒是你們那個小姑娘却眞把我害苦了！幾大幾夜的發燒，害得我比日夜唱雙齣還累。外面去請大夫，配藥，買東西是我，晚上跟奶媽子輪流着抱孩子也是我；這種婆兒媽兒的事，我姓趙的一生也幹不來！」設着，他便把身上的長衣卸下了，翹着一腿，坐在秋海棠的床沿上。「好兄弟，我給你磕頭行不行？別問梅寶這孩子我現在心裹多少疼她，可是這樣一天到晚的把關我在家裹，再過幾天，我這個人一定就要廢了！所以，老三，千萬求你好好養息，快些給我把這副擔子挑過去吧！」</p>
<p>玉崑說的時候，儘管還　着幾分開玩笑的氣息，但向來知道他那樣野馬似的性格的秋海棠，已不由感激得心酸淚洛了。</p>
<p>「你旣然惦記　，爲什麼不派個人來找我呢？」秋海棠從薄薄的線氈裹，勉强仲出一條手來，握住了玉崑的膀子，玉崑立刻輕輕地掙脫了，依舊把它放回到原來的地位上去。</p>
<p>「我怕那個地方給別人知道了不妥當，……別讓小梅寶也給他們硬搶了去…。」</p>
<p>玉崑從自己的衣袋裹，掏出一支又皺又曲的捲烟來，放在手堂裹滾了一滾，然後回頭看着他的把兄弟說：</p>

<h3 id="c63">演老頭兒的小伙子　…王即絮特寫… <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 之瑜</p>
<p>看過辣斐的「家」的人們，大概還記得演那位年老龍鍾的高老太爺的王即絮吧！你看他在台上的那副「老氣橫秋」的樣子，是多麼道地，「這角色本來大概也是個老頭兒，不然，那能會得裝得這樣像，」觀　們恐怕都這麼想吧！但那裏知道他還祇是一個二十來　的小伙子呢！</p>
<p>在「風頭至上」主義下的今日劇影界的演員們，養格老一點的當然是非「主角」不演，就是那班初出茅廬的所謂新人」們，也爭先恐後的惟「主角」之是演，雖然他（她）們的演技還未成熟。我們的那位王即絮君，他從事戲劇生活已足足有十年了，資格不可說不老，幾年前也曾自編自導自演過「蘇武牧羊」，成積實在「勿淚班」，但「你一紅，人家就要妒忌你」，他就這樣地被「人家」撇了出來，一氣之下，他　投入影圈。現在話劇慢慢地在抬頭了。「眞金到底勿怕火」，他就又被請回到了話劇界。</p>
<p>從他的名字—「即絮」—裏，就可以知道他是沒有家的流浪兒，他在這個大時代裏辛苦地奮鬥着，他還在大夏大學念書，同時在一所中學敎書，眞的，他可以說是忙得連氣都透不過來：上大學校念書；上中學校敎書；上影戲塲拍戲；上話劇院演戲；最近他還在寫一個淸廷的宮闈故事，因此，「好力生」是一瓶一瓶的吃下去。他，還是一副「老」腔！</p>
<p>「呀！最近我的體重减輕了十五磅！」他曾這樣地對我說過。</p>
<p>最後，還有一件事倒也要提一提。他在台上是一口流利的國語，在台下却滿嘴是「阿拉」「阿拉」的寗波話，問他爲什麼不講國語，他的回答是：「阿拉是寗波人！」</p>
<h3 id="c64">愁城記 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 郭嘯</p>
<p>夏衍繼「賽金花」「上海屋　下」和「花燭之夜」（原名一年間）之後，又有新作「愁城記」在辣斐劇塲上演了。此劇寫的是囤積居奇的投機者的失敗，足可與社會一個當頭棒喝。第三幕寫窮人排隊買米，錢被竊去，反被誣爲賊，挨巡警的皮鞭，最是令人警惕感動。一面窮人餓死，一面米蛀虫的妻子聽說米漲的價，非常高興地說：「還要長，還要長！」眞不知是何居心。</p>
<p>作者的手法極好。即如寫嬸母薄待姪女，只以瑣事襯託。叔父回家，姪女忙着打臉水；嬸母外表說是難爲了她，心裹却是希望她如此的被使喚。後來姪女的丈夫回家，也要揩臉，一面嬸母喚女僕，一面姪女却識趣地搶着去打臉水。這裹面不著一字，却把嬸母歧視姪女的心理給活畫出來。</p>
<p>演姪女的沈敏是成功的。她擅演悲劇，總是演年輕的苦命女子。如「小丈夫」「夜上海」「海戀」「職業婦女」等，可說無一不是屬於這類型的。新近金星影片公司請她演「花濺淚」中的顧小妹，也是一個可憐的　者。大約沈敏性情沈靜，忠厚，天眞，所以演這一類型的角色，最爲適宜。加以對於藝術嚴肅和認眞的態度，每每假戲眞做，純然忘我：演到悲傷的地方，不禁生的悶脫的眞的大哭起來，這也是她的長處。</p>
<p>黃宗江的何晋芳也極自然。聽對方說話的神情，昂首得意而帶微笑，允爲這肖。他如蘇丹的趙福泉，綢短衫裏面的汗衫露出了一點，活像生意人；　耘的老太婆，小脚走路是出名的；石揮的林孟平，憂　而且高傲；白沉的李彥雲，活潑詼諧，樂觀而目勇敢；流金的趙梅芬，可憐而且善良：都能各自刻劃其性格，使此劇成爲平勻發展配搭齊整的演出。</p>
<p>國語也是在水準以上的，惟有時稍不留心，高低有誤。例如，巡捕的捕字雖爲陽平聲，讀音每若去聲，却錯讀成上聲的浦字。又如，勉强的强應作上聲，却誤讀成平聲强盜的强。</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Ships Concentrate in the North Atlantic: US Public Opinion Favors Escort; President Roosevelt to Deliver Important Speech; Actions to Aid Democratic Nations and Protect Merchant Ships to Be Kept Secret <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington – Government sources recently hinted that Britain has concentrated its naval power in the North Atlantic. This situation is sufficient to ensure the relative safety of US-bound cargo ships. Knowledgeable sources believe that although the situation in the North Atlantic is gradually improving, Britain is not satisfied with maritime safety alone. Some people have questioned Senator Barkley's claim that US goods are being safely delivered to Britain. President Westhover stated yesterday that he did not believe Barkley had made such a statement. (United Press International, 21st)</p>
<p>New York – According to a recent Gallup public opinion poll, the percentage of the American public favoring US escort of military supplies to Britain has increased by 11%. The organization also declared that, according to research, the majority of American voters would rather go to war than see Britain defeated. According to the survey, 52% of Americans polled favored escort, compared to 41% a month earlier. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Tallahassee – The Florida State Legislature unanimously passed a resolution yesterday requesting the US Congress to provide naval escorts for Britain and to provide aid to Britain to the fullest extent possible. The body, by a vote of 69 to 0, specifically requested that Congress send naval escorts to transport munitions and supplies to Britain. (United Press International, 21st)</p>
<p>London – News correspondents stationed in Washington predict that President Roosevelt will deliver an important speech in the shortest possible time, possibly within a week. Meanwhile, German newspapers are launching a massive attack on President Roosevelt's recent remarks. One newspaper condemned President Roosevelt as being brainless and the biggest liar in the world. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday received journalists and stated that he may not be sending any special messages to Congress in the near future. The hundred or so reporters present were disappointed to hear this, as they had gathered at the White House office, fully expecting to hear the President's decision on major policies. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – It was learned yesterday that Britain expects the US to eventually join the war. Britain's victory plan is based on this assumption. US officials are convinced that British leaders may no longer believe that Britain can make military decisions without US participation. The British government is now adopting a strategy of protracted war, waiting for the US to be fully prepared and join the fighting. It is widely believed that the American people once thought that Britain could not win without US participation, so the US will inevitably join the war with all its strength. It is generally pointed out that recent US actions have not disappointed Britain. Not only that, it is believed that the recent statements issued by Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Secretary of the Interior Ickes have all increased Britain's confidence. (International News Service, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – The US Maritime Commission yesterday requested newspapers, radio stations, news agencies, and other public information organizations to voluntarily review news about the actions of US merchant ships aiding democratic nations. Maritime Commission Chairman Rear Admiral Land listed the following items as information that should not be published: (1) Actual or intended actions of any ships aiding Britain and other democratic nations. This applies particularly to ships sailing to rivers, seas, China, and Rangoon. This includes grain ships. (2) The nature of the ships used to aid democratic nations and the names of their routes. (3) The arrival and departure of these ships. (4) The goods carried by these ships. Land pointed out that the press had cooperated with the US Navy Department regarding the movement of US warships and personnel. He also said that the press had voluntarily stopped publishing the movements of British warships. He further stated, "The actions of US merchant ships aiding democratic nations are equally important. News about these actions should also not be disclosed." (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – The House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill authorizing the Maritime Commission to regulate shipping prices, cargo, and voyages for national defense purposes. The bill has been sent to the Senate. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – The US Shipping Commission officially announced today that President Roosevelt's plan to collect two million tons of shipping to aid Britain and supplement the US Navy has now acquired 1.5 million tons of shipping, of which 460,000 tons are foreign ships that have been stranded in US ports due to the war. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt will soon sign a bill to take over these ships. Regarding the fate of the world's largest passenger ship, the French liner "Normandie" (86,000 tons), it is reported that experts from the US Shipping Commission are currently discussing converting it into a convoy transport ship or an aircraft carrier.

<p>Tokyo – The Yomiuri Shimbun published an editorial this morning stating that President Roosevelt's policy is aimed at getting public support for US participation in the war. The direction of US public sentiment in the next few days will determine the fate of the US. The newspaper believes that the US President and his war cabinet may advocate occupying French territories in the western Atlantic and Dakar in North Africa. This would be tantamount to entering the war without a declaration of war. The US President's recent silence on the issue of armed escort suggests that he also knows that this move will lead to war. However, the US President is prepared to take this step. The only obstacle now is strong public opinion. Public opinion is now divided into two factions: one opposes this move, and the other is hesitant. President's Roosevelt's fireside chat on the 27th of this month will reveal the extent to which the government believes it has succeeded in stirring up the fervor for war. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has asked Congress to approve $8,886,000,000 in relief funding for the year beginning July 1. This amount is $109,000,000 less than the estimated amount in the current budget. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Washington – From President Roosevelt's domestic defense program yesterday, it is clear that he intends to give every American man, woman, and child the opportunity to help defend the country. The President announced the establishment of the Office of Civilian Defense yesterday evening, with Mayor La Guardia of New York as its director. This organization is based purely on volunteerism and will be managed by the Office of Emergency Management. La Guardia will arrive in Washington today to begin operations. (United Press International, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt announced the establishment of a civil defense organization within the United States at a press conference yesterday, saying that he had issued an executive order establishing the Office of Civil Defense, with Mayor La Guardia of New York as its director. The office is divided into two groups: one is the Civilian Protection Group, which will also include representatives from the Departments of the Navy, Army, and Justice to guide and assist in the development of civil defense plans to ensure adequate protection of life and property in the event of an emergency; the other is the Volunteer Participation Group, which will be composed of representatives from all levels across the country. La Guardia will remain the Mayor of New York, but will serve as Director of the Office of Civilian Defense without pay. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has sent a letter to House Speaker Rayburn, urging Congress to expedite legislation to facilitate the laying of oil pipelines to benefit national defense, saying that the matter is extremely important. The lack of convenient oil transportation now means that oil consumption may need to be limited to essential uses within a few months. The Atlantic coast industry, people and military bases now rely entirely on coastal oil tankers to transport oil. This method is time-consuming and dangerous. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Honolulu – Hawaii held its third air raid defense exercise last night. Multiple US heavy bombers flew overhead, and lights across the island were almost uniformly turned off at 9:15 PM. This complete blackout was part of one of the largest military exercises in Hawaii's history. Honolulu and remote rural areas were all uniformly implementing the drill to guard against enemy aircraft bombing. Within minutes after US Army observers reported an air raid alert to headquarters, the lights were completely extinguished, sirens and bells rang out, street lights briefly flashed before going completely dark, and all key military institutions were also completely darkened. 40,000 troops were deployed in completed battlefield fortresses, using searchlights to find enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft artillery units were prepared to start combat when enemy aircraft appeared.

<p>Tokyo – An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun this morning speculated on the outcome of the commercial negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies, saying that the success or failure of the negotiations should be known within the next week. It also said that Yoshizawa, the Japanese chief representative, had made great efforts in the negotiations, but feared that they would ultimately fail. However, Japan should still be patient and persevere, because the issue of establishing a co-prosperity sphere in East Asia is fundamentally peaceful. It is hoped that the Netherlands East Indies will also take appropriate steps to adapt to the rapidly changing situation in the world. Iraq and Iran are about to break away from British control, so the oil produced by the Netherlands East Indies is not only particularly valued by Britain, but also by the United States. Japan, of course, must give serious consideration to the future progress of these commercial negotiations. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing – The Executive Yuan held its 515th meeting on the 21st. All ministers and officials attended. In addition to reports on foreign affairs and military matters, the decisions on various cases are selected and recorded below: (1) The Secretariat and Political Affairs Office submitted a request for approval of the draft Food Department Organization Law and the draft Trade Department Organization Law. It was resolved that the Food Department Organization Law be amended and approved, and the Trade Department Organization Law be referred for review. (2) The relevant ministries and commissions reviewed and revised the principles for relieving the children of active-duty military personnel who are unable to attend school during the war of resistance against Japan and requested approval to be submitted to the competent authorities for proper arrangements and implementation. It was resolved that the following principles be approved: If the children of active-duty military officers and enlisted personnel are studying at public secondary schools or above during the war of resistance against Japan and are unable to afford tuition and accommodation fees, the military authorities shall investigate the economic conditions of their families according to their military rank. If the investigation confirms that they are indeed unable to afford the fees, they may be exempted from tuition and accommodation fees. (3) The Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal to revise the temporary rules for travel expenses for business trips to Vietnam, Burma, Hong Kong, and other places, specifying the amount of travel expenses for personnel at various ranks. It was resolved that the revisions be approved. (4) The Chongqing Municipal Government submitted a request to continue operating the low-priced porridge kitchens and requested appropriate subsidies. It was resolved that the request be approved. (5) The National Health Administration submitted a request from the Tengyue Quarantine Station to establish a Manyun Quarantine Sub-station. It was resolved that the request be approved. Appointments and Removals: (1) The Premier proposed the appointment of Hu Wanpeng as a member of the Hunan Provincial Government and concurrently as Director of the Department of Finance. It was resolved that the proposal be approved. (2) The Premier proposed the appointment of Peng Ruogang as a member of the Henan Provincial Government and concurrently as Director of the Department of Finance. It was resolved that the proposal be approved. Furthermore, Ms. Fordling, former Vice-President of Ginling Women's College, has been engaged in education in China for many years and has achieved remarkable results. During the war of resistance, she led relief efforts to benefit women and children, which is worthy of praise. It is learned that she has passed away in the United States, and people across the country are mourning her. At today's Executive Yuan meeting, Vice-Premier Kong specially proposed that the Yuan submit a request to the National Government for a commendation order, which was approved by the Yuan.

<h3 id="e11">Overview of the Current International Situation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Just as British forces launched an offensive in Iraq, German paratroopers suddenly attacked Crete, where the exiled Greek government was located. Although most of the first batch of 1,500 German troops were quickly annihilated, a second batch of 3,000 paratroopers continued to land, and were still fighting hard as of this writing. Crete is sparsely populated with inadequate defenses, which favors paratrooper operations. However, unlike in the Netherlands previously, they will not find strong support from fifth columnists there. If the defending forces can calmly respond with sufficient strength and the British air force can quickly gain control of the skies, then perhaps the painful history of last year will not be repeated on the last piece of Greek territory. If this German move is said to be a test run for the invasion of England, it is not worth much attention, because everything about the British Isles is incomparable to Crete. The experience gained by the German army in this operation will be difficult to apply to England in the same way. On the other hand, it is sufficient to show Germany's emphasis on the Eastern Mediterranean, not allowing Britain to drive a wedge into the vicinity of the Greek Peninsula, the Aegean Islands, and even the Dodecanese Islands. At the same time, this is also an attempt to clear its route eastward.</p>
<p>However, the corner of the Near East is not the most advantageous battlefield for Germany to confront Britain. From the current situation, seizing British oil fields and cutting off the Suez Canal are not achievable overnight. The surrender of the last Abyssinian Italian troops has given Britain more convenience in military operations. Unless other major changes occur internationally, such as changes in the attitude of the Soviet Union or Turkey, it is difficult to imagine that Germany can easily achieve any decisive progress. It is the Atlantic and the Far East that have seen more turbulent and delicate situations recently. The content of Darland's negotiations with Germany has not yet been announced, but it can be asserted that the concessions made by Vichy are by no means minor. The convenience gained by German forces in Syria is only the tip of the iceberg. Of course, France has no real strength or possibility of fighting against Britain. Germany also knows that if it forces Vichy too much, it would be tantamount to strangling its life and indirectly boosting the strength of the de Gaulle faction. However, concessions such as the use of some important military bases, as well as giving German forces more operational cooperation and assistance, are undeniable. No matter how Vichy defends itself, it must seek a way to survive in a future of helping Germany defeat Britain. The fate of Pétain, Darland, and their ilk was actually destined from the moment of Compiègne. Both Britain and the United States have been greatly agitated by this and their relationship with the Vichy government is hanging by a thread, but it seems that they have not yet determined their response in practical actions. The Syrian issue has already caused Britain considerable trouble in the Near East. If new changes occur in the Western Mediterranean, and even in West Africa in North Africa, not only will Britain's maritime power in the Mediterranean be in danger, but the storms in the Atlantic will also become more treacherous, and will threaten the security of American countries. Admiral Leahy and the French food aid have not overcome the coercion and temptation of the Nazis. From now on, there is no other way but to adopt a firm and resolute strategy to deal with the situation. At the same time, this is also the approaching maturity of the US's opportunity to enter the war.</p>
<p>Amidst this turmoil, only the situation in the Far East seems to be unaffected by the progress of the European war, which is strangely intriguing. The Soviet-Japanese pact did not receive a better response than the Tripartite Pact. The practical value of the Tripartite Pact's provisions for dealing with other countries participating in the European war cannot be accurately assessed by anyone. At the same time, the war against China is expanding. Suddenly, a trial balloon was found suggesting that the United States mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Even if Tokyo denies this, it seems not absolutely inconceivable when compared with the recent statement of "striving to resolve the China incident diplomatically." Naturally, the influence of the current European war on the United States is sufficient to create an illusion that the US's approaching the brink of war will reduce its concern for the Far East. If it is possible to take this opportunity to allay American suspicions, it may be possible to exchange it for some concessions from the United States. This is the main reason for the various gestures that have been made recently. As for the tough tone on the other hand, it may be a gesture to coordinate with this, or it may fundamentally represent the views of the opponents. The variety and divergence of opinions and arguments these days are sufficient to prove that not only will they not receive any effective response externally, but they also lack a unified point of view and confidence internally.</p>
<p>Now is the eve of the international situation entering another new stage. Most of the future development of the situation will be dominated by the various factors that are currently in progress. Major changes occurred in the international community at this time last year, but everything now may be of more decisive significance than the various events of last year.</p>

<p>Tokyo – The official military news of the Japanese army in Guangzhou announced today that the Japanese army in the Huizhou area of Guangdong has retreated to an undisclosed destination. Since the Chinese army has been completely defeated, there is no need for the Japanese army to remain in the area. A spokesman for the Japanese army in South China issued a statement in Guangzhou regarding the Japanese army's withdrawal from Huizhou, saying that the 160th Division, the 9th Independent Brigade, and other local troops of the Chinese army had been defeated during the fighting in Huizhou last week.

<p>Chongqing – The Ta Kung Pao commented on the importance of the situation in Southern Shanxi and made an appeal in its editorial today, saying that Shanxi is a northern plateau, and by controlling Shanxi, the northern provinces can be controlled. The Zhongtiao Mountains are the key to Shanxi, and by having the Zhongtiao Mountains, Shanxi cannot be lost. The Zhongtiao Mountains have been the most important strategic base in the north for our army in the past three or four years. This time, the Japanese army has concentrated the strength of eight divisions to fight for it, and the Chinese army should attach great importance to it. So far, the main reason why the Japanese have been able to gain some advantages in the area is that the Chinese army has failed to coordinate and be consistent. Most of the reports from the Japanese side are fabrications and cannot be believed. However, the fact remains that the Southern Shanxi campaign has been going on for half a month, the Chinese army is fighting hard, the whole country is concerned, and the 18th Group Army is concentrated in northern Shanxi and has not yet cooperated with friendly forces. We hereby sincerely appeal that all national troops in Shanxi must coordinate, be consistent, and fight together. We want the north, so we cannot give up Shanxi. We want Shanxi, so we cannot give up the Zhongtiao Mountains. Therefore, the Battle of Southern Shanxi must be fought with all our strength to ensure its victory. The 18th Group Army should immediately go to aid Zhongtiaoshan. In this way, all Japanese rumors will disappear, and loyalty and courage will be greatly demonstrated. (Dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Chengdu: More than sixty aircraft belonging to the Japanese 12th and 13th Naval Air Groups invaded Sichuan Province in batches around 8:00 AM on the 20th, carrying out wanton destruction. Apart from bomber squadrons dropping bombs on Liangshan and Yibin in separate waves, twenty-one fighter planes in the vanguard advanced towards Chengdu in two batches. At 11:10 AM, they intruded into the city airspace and dispersed, circling over the suburbs. At 11:20 AM, twelve Japanese planes, in a single file formation, flew low from the south of the city towards the southern suburbs. A Boeing 767, No. 767, was hit by machine gun fire from the Chinese Air Force guard unit and immediately crashed in Baiyangchang, part of Huayang County. The entire plane was destroyed by fire, and the pilot was burned to death. The remaining Japanese planes attacked eastward in waves. Afterwards, this reporter rushed to Baiyangchang for inspection and saw that the Japanese plane had sunk five or six feet into the ground. The fuselage and wings were mostly destroyed due to the explosion of the fuel tank after being hit. The tail of the plane remained intact, with the sun emblem still visible. Inside the plane were a pistol, a parachute, two maps, and a flight suit, bearing the inscription "12th Air Group, Kimura," etc. There was also a seal with the inscription "Kimura," presumably belonging to Kimura of the Japanese 12th Naval Air Group. It is understood that the aircraft was manufactured by Mitsubishi and had a flight endurance of up to seven hours. The plane was also equipped with twelve machine guns and cannons and was the latest elite aircraft used by the Japanese Naval Air Force. (Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Chen Jiageng's Statement: Supporting the Government <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Singapore: Overseas Chinese leader and current Chairman of the China Relief Fund, Chen Jiageng, issued an article to local reporters last night, repeatedly declaring his intention to uphold the Chongqing government and support national unity in fighting Japan to the end. Chen mentioned a report in the local Japanese newspaper stating that a leader with representative qualifications from Fujian Province had telegraphed an invitation for Chen to return home, saying that he had not received a single word from Fuzhou. This is a typical trick of Japanese propagandists to sow discord among overseas Chinese groups and cause friction. It should be known that overseas Chinese have been continuously remitting huge sums of money to the central government to aid in war expenses. This action has already proven the will of the overseas Chinese. Last autumn, when he toured Fujian Province, he did witness poor administration and repeatedly requested the central government to find ways to reform the situation. He believed that if improvements were not made, not only would the people suffer, but Japan would be given an opportunity. His request to eliminate obstacles in the war of resistance and national reconstruction is the responsibility of every citizen towards the motherland. The Japanese, knowing that the overseas Chinese firmly support the government's policies, are carrying out malicious propaganda in an attempt to undermine and divide overseas Chinese unity.

<p>Hong Kong: Reliable sources here claim that yesterday a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) passenger plane was forced to land by Japanese warplanes near Shufu (transliteration) on the Yangtze River, west of Chongqing. The Japanese planes then fired machine guns at the CNAC plane. Among those on board were three Americans, one of whom was the pilot, Hooters, and the other two were the well-known missionary Dr. White and his wife. Fortunately, none were injured. The plane was flying from Chongqing to Chengdu, and Dr. White was going to Chengdu to supervise the university hospital, while his wife was to serve as head nurse. The couple had recently returned to China from the US. Sources here say that Japanese bombers first forced the Douglas DC-2 passenger plane to land, and then fired machine guns at it, damaging the plane's wings. This was not the first time that pilot Hooters had narrowly escaped death. On August 24, 1938, he was piloting a plane that was shot down by Japanese planes near Macau. Fifteen of the nineteen people on board died, while Hooters and four others swam ashore. Hooters had also been stationed in Shanghai for many years and was well-regarded. Dr. White and his wife had also served in China for many years and had recently returned to manage the university hospital, which was funded by the United Christian Universities of China, with its head office in New York City.

<p>Crete: According to the Cretan military authorities, all Nazi paratroopers who landed in Crete yesterday have been killed or captured, and the situation is now under control. A total of 1,500 German paratroopers landed in Crete yesterday morning during the attack, in the areas of Canea and Maleme, by glider, parachute, and troop transport planes. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources, the German army continued its airborne attacks at 4:30 PM yesterday, with no fewer than 3,000 paratroopers jumping from the sky. The majority of them were cleared by the Allied forces within three hours, and it is said that the situation is under control. The Germans used Stuka aircraft, Messerschmitt aircraft, gliders, paratroopers, and troop transport planes. Many of these planes were destroyed upon landing. According to news from London, the Germans also attempted a naval landing in Crete yesterday during several airborne landings. It is generally believed that at least 7,000 troops from one German airborne division participated in the operation. Fighting continues today, but according to responsible sources, the situation is under control. Most of the paratroopers jumped from the sky within two hours. The Germans reportedly used dive bombers to cover the landings. The authorities' statement that the situation is under control does not mean that all paratroopers and airborne troops have been eliminated. It is believed that several troop transport planes were shot down before landing on the island. According to reliable sources in London, the enemy bombed Crete all day on May 19. On the morning of Tuesday, the Germans launched another fierce attack, with paratroopers jumping down. Later, they used gliders and troop transport planes. It is rumored that some paratroopers were wearing New Zealand uniforms, but this has been denied by the Germans, who say that this type of uniform is new for paratroopers. The main landing sites were in the west, but some paratroopers also landed in Heraklion. It is said that the German airborne division does not nominally include paratroopers. It is rumored that this division has two infantry regiments and an airborne regiment with an artillery regiment carrying twenty-four 7.4-caliber mountain guns. This regiment has three rifle companies and one machine gun company. The German airborne division continued landing until dusk on Tuesday. It is rumored that several of these troop transport planes were shot down before landing. There is no evidence to support the rumor that the planes were carrying tanks. It is said that the German airborne division does not have transport vehicles, but has been given special orders to requisition vehicles locally upon landing. The Germans used approximately 250 troop transport planes, transporting in three or four waves. The paratroopers landed first, and if successful, they would send a signal, after which the airborne troops would begin landing. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>London: People here today are eagerly awaiting news from Crete, as it is believed that German paratroopers must still be landing on the island at night, and it is believed that the fiercest fighting may have already occurred. Military experts believe that if Crete is occupied by the Germans, it will be a serious failure for Britain to maintain control of the eastern Mediterranean. They believe that the island has two most dangerous areas: the Maleme Peninsula in the Suda Bay area on the northwest coast, only fourteen miles long, and the narrow isthmus extending from Almyros Bay to the south. The troops controlling this isthmus can cut off Canea, the seat of the Greek government, and Suda Bay from the rest of Crete. It is not yet known to what extent the German high command is prepared to sacrifice in order to send elite paratroopers to try to occupy the entire island. However, some people suspect that the paratroopers are a suicide squad, trying to disperse British forces and allow the Germans to achieve their attempt to attack Egypt or enter Iraq via Syria.

<p>London: After German troop transport planes and gliders carrying a suicide squad of 1,500 paratroopers landed on Crete, brutal guerrilla warfare broke out on the island. The German paratroopers were wearing New Zealand convoy uniforms and landed at various key locations. This tactic is the same as the German strategy of occupying Rotterdam, Netherlands, on May 10, 1940, which aimed to first secure several footholds and then wait for reinforcements to arrive. According to Prime Minister Churchill's report in the House of Commons, a large German force is still holding out south of Canea on the Maleme road. However, after fierce and brutal fighting in various locations, the German paratrooper force is gradually being conquered. Last year, both Britain and France warned Germany that if Nazi paratroopers used Allied military uniforms, they would be treated as spies (i.e., executed). Therefore, this war is very brutal. The Allied forces, given the fall of Rotterdam, Netherlands, last year, will fiercely resist this time. Judging from the achievements of Allied Commander Freyberg in the European War, it can be seen that he will never spare the lives of German soldiers wearing British military uniforms. Observers believe that the battle of Crete has three purposes: (1) To occupy an important fortress in the Mediterranean and open the way for the German army to Syria, (2) To contain the British army in order to launch a large-scale offensive elsewhere, (3) To serve as a practical exercise for attacking the British Isles.

<p>London: British Prime Minister Churchill reported on the war situation in the House of Commons last night, saying that in the past few days, British reconnaissance planes have repeatedly reported seeing various German planes gathered at airfields in southern Greece, in large numbers. British planes attacked them every night, causing heavy damage. But now it is known that the concentration of enemy planes was the prelude to the attack on Crete. The enemy began a fierce attack on the morning of the 20th, and a fierce battle broke out. The British army, including the New Zealand army and the Greek army, responded under the command of General Freyberg. The enemy first bombed and fiercely bombarded Suda Bay and nearby airfields. Then, 1,500 enemy soldiers wearing New Zealand uniforms (the audience shouted angrily) landed in the Ganima-Maleme area by glider and troop transport plane with parachutes. According to military information at 3:00 PM on the 20th, the situation was already under British control. A military hospital between the towns of Canea and Maleme, which had been seized by enemy soldiers, has now been recaptured. It is reported that there are still enemy soldiers who have not been cleared south of the main road in the two towns. The rest should have been resolved. Such is the military development of Crete, which I think the House would like to hear. (The audience cheered)</p>

<p>The British Prime Minister continued to speak about the war in Abyssinia, saying that the victory at Amba Alagi will surely bring the stubborn resistance of the Abyssinian resistance to an end. Although the fighting in the south will have to continue for some time, the most significant battle now appears to be coming to an end. In January of this year, military experts still considered late May or mid-May to be the earliest time for the British army to attack Somaliland. Anyone familiar with the area did not initially expect that the British army, in this desolate region, would have achieved such great success with its courageous actions and extraordinary strategy. The South African army has made great contributions. Now that the fierce fighting in this area is about to end, the South African army will move north to the Mediterranean. (The audience cheered) Two divisions of Indian soldiers have also repeatedly made great contributions, enduring hardship and fighting well, and are admired by the British soldiers.</p>

<p>The fighting in the Solon area is also worth mentioning. The fighting there is purely between British and German soldiers. The fighting is fierce, but the scope is not very large. The British mechanized units, supplemented by armored vehicles and artillery, attacked the enemy, capturing the Solon Hellfire Pass and the Capuzzo Fort. On May 17, the British armored units maneuvered to the side and controlled the area. However, the German army launched a desperate counterattack with forty tanks and recaptured Capuzzo. As a result, the British armored units had to withdraw from the positions they had captured. Therefore, the fighting in this area has not been decided. The Germans claim to have captured 100 British soldiers, while the British have captured 500 German prisoners. The enemy's losses of tanks and other equipment, if not greater than the British, must not be light. In the past six weeks, the Germans have often boasted to the neutral countries of the world that they will soon reach Suez and have exaggerated their victories. But we have now maintained their strong offensive force and are engaged in a war of evenly matched forces outside the Egyptian border. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Vichy: Since British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons a few days ago, relations between Britain and France have entered their final stage. Foreign Secretary Eden's speech can be regarded as a threat to French-mandated territories. The British Air Force immediately bombed the airfields of Syria, killing several French people. General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria, gave a speech the other day, clarifying his position and resolving to meet violence with violence. French Air Minister General Bergeret has gone to Syria, intending to strengthen air defenses in the Near East. Officials here have said that although the French government has repeatedly issued statements, vigorously defending the determination of the French Empire to resist any foreign aggression remains unchanged, but it has never taken any provocative actions.

<p>Washington – French Ambassador to the US, Henri-Haye, notified Secretary of State Hull yesterday that France would resist any attempt to seize any part of its empire, "including Martinique Island." Henri-Haye also protested the United States' dispatch of armed guards to monitor French ships docked in US harbors. Henri-Haye stated that he notified Hull that France would not recognize any declarations aimed at seizing French territory and added that the main purpose of his visit to the Secretary of State was to seek clarification of the "turmoil" caused by the United States. This "turmoil" is unreasonable because France has not acted beyond the scope of the Franco-German armistice. Germany and Italy, under the Franco-German armistice, have the right to use French airfields, including bases in Syria. Henri-Haye said that he reminded Hull of France's war losses. (June 21st, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – The Vichy Ambassador to the US, Henri-Haye, has protested to Secretary of State Hull, opposing the unfriendly act of the US sending police to guard French ships in the US. He told reporters that the United States has reacted to recent events in France, especially the progress of Franco-German cooperation. The French government is quite surprised by this, so he has discussed the general US opinion of France with Hull. According to Article 18 of the Franco-German armistice, all French air ports must be placed under German-Italian control, but this fact has been forgotten, and it must be reiterated. Under this armistice, German aircraft have the right to land at French airfields in Syria. Under the leadership of Marshal Pétain, there is only one France, so any attempt to alienate the French people will fail. France has declared that it does not intend to participate in the war, but it does not abandon the right of the French people to take the steps they deem necessary to meet their needs. He has repeatedly explained to Hull that the French government will protect its territories such as Martinique and Dakar, to reject any attempt to change their sovereignty. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy – Paris Radio has broadcast the news that "the French government has instructed the troops stationed on Martinique Island to prepare to defend the island against American aggression." People with inside knowledge of this matter have neither acknowledged nor confirmed this statement. (June 20th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>New York – Diplomatic sources in Washington say that the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" and the cruiser "Berlin" are preparing to leave Martinique Island, possibly carrying a large amount of gold reserves. (June 20th, TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – Well-informed sources here say that the US believes that France's permission for German aircraft to use Syrian airfields to attack British forces in Iraq is beyond the scope of the armistice agreement. Secretary of State Hull conveyed this opinion when he met with French Ambassador Henri-Haye yesterday and told him that the world believes that elements tending toward the Axis powers are manipulating the Vichy government. If this impression is wrong, then Vichy should correct it. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday sarcastically compared the port of Dakar in Africa to Tangdan on the Sino-Vietnamese border, which was occupied by the Japanese army in Guangxi last year. Last year, during the Republican campaign, the nation was warned that Roosevelt would send America to war to defend the poor land of Tangdan. This year, isolationists may again use Dakar as the same excuse. However, the President did not elaborate on the Dakar issue, and observers are quite puzzled. The US government may take direct action to prevent Dakar from falling into German hands. (June 21st, United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>London – Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned last night that although the Vichy government severed diplomatic relations with Britain last year, the British government still allowed the French Consul-General in London, Chatel, to remain in London, enjoying slightly restricted diplomatic privileges, in order to carry out some limited consular functions. Recently, due to the Vichy government's actions that harmed the British government, the British government requested the recall of Chatel. The Vichy side used this as an excuse to request the British Consul Harvard to leave Beirut. It is reported that Harvard has already left the country, and the French authorities have requested all British consulate officials stationed in Syria to leave the country within eight days.

<p>Vichy – A communiqué issued here yesterday stated that General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria, instructed by the Foreign Ministry, notified the British Consul-General in Lebanon on Friday to cease operations and leave the country immediately. This action is a retaliatory measure because the British government has expelled the French Consul-General in London. According to dispatches from Beirut, after British aircraft attacked Syrian airfields, the French government decided to cease the activities of all British consulates in Syria and Lebanon and asked them to leave the country within a week.

<p>Washington – It was announced last night that the State Department had sent a telegram to the US Embassy in Berlin, instructing it to investigate the whereabouts of the American passengers on the "Sansen" that was sunk by a German warship.

The United States may demand the immediate release of the rescued Americans and try to transport them back to the country. Amidst the tension in German-American relations, Germany may not reject the US request.

<h3 id="e37">Italy Under the Control of the German Political Police <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>This is another report made by David, the US Christian Science Monitor correspondent stationed in Rome, after returning home. It is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Most of the major cities in Italy are already under the control of the German political police. Mussolini's intention was to use them to suppress domestic revolutionary conspiracies.</p>
<p>When the reporter left Rome in late February this year, the German plan to control Italy was largely completed. Their strategy was simple and effective, carried out in secret, and the Italians were kept in the dark. Under the guise of technology, they continuously sent political advisors, administrative experts, economic regulators, military inspection teams, and political police to operate. When the Italian army was repeatedly defeated in Africa, the German political police dispatched a large number of personnel to various departments of the Italian government to study measures to suppress rebellion. At the turn of January and February this year, the Italian government was increasingly demoralized under the shadow of defeat, and government affairs almost came to a standstill, so the Germans took over at their leisure.</p>
<p>The reporter discovered this invisible occupation as early as the beginning of November last year. At that time, a team of German political police was stationed in the Viminal Palace, where the Ministry of the Interior is located. It is said that their mission was to support the pro-German faction in the Italian political police force in order to deal with the anti-German moderates.</p>
<p>Paglini, the director of the Italian political police, was a person who was outwardly stern but inwardly weak and was extremely anxious about this situation. One day, he said to a close friend, "I am maintaining the situation day by day now. Once I can't maintain it, I will have to let the Germans take over all the power."</p>
<p>This was at the beginning of November. By the end of the month, Paglini had indeed resigned and left the subordinates of Himmler, the director of the German political police, to do whatever they wanted. At the same time, the personnel inside the German Embassy and the German News Agency were also thriving, but the newcomers were mostly idle.</p>
<p>Most Italians were paying attention to the war and had no time to take care of domestic affairs. Even if there were insightful people, they could only sigh helplessly. In early February this year, a diplomat with the most well-informed sources in Rome told me, "The Germans' deployment has been completed, but the Italian people still know nothing."</p>
<p>I asked him if Mussolini himself was aware of what his pro-German subordinates were doing. He replied, "No."</p>
<p>The above is the story of an invisible revolution. As for the German army, as of the beginning of January this year, only the air force was stationed on Sicily. In addition, there were one or two armored divisions that had also been sent there to protect the air force and prevent British attacks. It was not until early February, when the internal crisis in Italy deepened, that the German army began to arrive continuously, but they did not go to northern Italy, where the anti-German atmosphere was stronger. They went directly to the port of Naples and Sicily in order to operate from there towards Tripoli, Bizerte, and French territories in Africa. It is said that there may be as many as eighteen German divisions entering Italy. We foreign reporters in Rome were at a loss for a while, thinking that such a large army could not be concealed, especially since everyone was discussing this matter. But we did not see these troops. It was not until we sat down and calculated the exact number of German army and air force personnel stationed in Italy that we discovered that this news was not unfounded.</p>
<p>We estimated that the German Air Force stationed 600 aircraft in Sicily to control the Strait of Sicily, requiring 21,000 personnel. These personnel, along with their equipment, could fill fifty or sixty trains. This was told to us by an expert familiar with the German air force organization.</p>
<p>The Germans in Weimar said that the German and Italian armies should not be mixed. The German army could act freely, and the Italian side should not obstruct them. At that time, there were rumors in Yugoslavia that anti-German movements had occurred in Milan, but in reality, it was still peaceful. During my stay in Italy, I did not hear of any serious anti-German demonstrations anywhere. The Germans acted cautiously everywhere, not wanting to give the general Italian public an excuse to oppose them.</p>
<p>However, this strategy of the Germans sometimes backfired. A friend of the reporter's in Italy witnessed a conflict between Italians and German officers. It happened in a small restaurant in a city in northern Italy where three German officers walked in for a meal. When they were paying the bill, one of the officers suddenly returned the bill and asked for it to be opened in German.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper hurriedly gave him a menu and explained in Italian that the prices were very fair, but the officer was unmoved. All the diners in the hall were angry and silently listened to the shopkeeper telling him that no one in the shop understood German.</p>
<p>The German officer lost his temper and said, "These places will be ours sooner or later!"</p>

<h3 id="e38">Leaders and Businessmen Held a Grand Banquet Yesterday Afternoon to Celebrate Sino-American Trade Week; Congratulatory Messages from the US Ambassador and Others Extolled and Encouraged; Commercial and Cultural Relations between the Two Countries Will Be Further Developed <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>This year is the 7th Sino-American Trade Week. The American community in Shanghai held a grand banquet at the American Club on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon to celebrate. During the banquet, US Commercial Counselor Coulter and Pan Enlin, President of China Travel Service, delivered important speeches successively. What is even more noteworthy is that US Secretary of Commerce Jones, US Chamber of Commerce President Hawkes, US Foreign Trade Association President Farrell, and newly appointed US Ambassador to China Gauss all sent congratulatory messages to Shanghai, expressing admiration for the courage and determination of the American businessmen in Shanghai, and expressing their determination to protect US interests in China. This proves that the United States, both the government and the public, are paying attention to Sino-American trade. Since the Sino-Japanese War and the European War, although the international situation has become abnormal, the figures for Sino-American trade have continued to increase. This is the result of the continuous efforts of Chinese and American people. Future development can be predicted. The relations between the two countries will definitely become more friendly and closer.</p>
<p>A Gathering of Talents; An Unprecedented Grand Occasion</p>
<p>Those who attended the grand banquet yesterday afternoon included, on the American side, Consul General Lockhart, Consul Badger, Yangtze River Fleet Commander Glasford, senior military officer Jeeves, Judge Helmick of the US Court in China, Finance Counselor Assistant Byron, and Ms. Smith, Director of the US Trade Office in Shanghai. On the Chinese side were Zhu Chuanquan, Manager of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, Zhang Yuelian, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, Xie Runming and Gu Shanchang, Assistant Managers of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, He De Kui, Chinese Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, Yan Deqing, and other leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors. The chairman was Nichols, Acting President of the American Chamber of Commerce, who first gave a speech, then introduced Pan Enlin, President of China Travel Service, and Coulter, US Commercial Counselor, to speak successively. Finally, the congratulatory messages from the US government and the public to Shanghai were read aloud. It was a gathering of talents, with clinking glasses and lively atmosphere, which was more grand than in previous years.</p>
<p>The Chairman Highly Praised China's Greatness</p>
<p>In his speech, Chairman Nichols said, "Although China has suffered many losses after the war, I firmly believe that it will be able to fully restore its original state in the future, and the future commercial relations between China and the United States will be even closer." Nichols also said, "The special work that we have contributed to the prosperity of the entire world is to promote the commercial relations between the great Three Principles of the People Republic and our motherland. Among us, there are those who have lived in the Far East for a long time and have gained experience in Sino-American trade. They all know that China and the United States have a special relationship, because the two countries can communicate with each other and complement each other's needs."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Enlin's Eloquent Speech</p>
<p>The speech of Mr. Pan Enlin, President of China Travel Service, meant that "at a time when transportation is frequently disrupted and trade is extremely difficult after the war, our commemoration of Sino-American Trade Week is of great significance. Currently, China's trade with the United States is more than that with any other country, which shows that the people of China and the United States already have very good friendship and commercial relations, so they can still have new developments in a state of war, and it is enough to prove that war can create new environments and meanings for trade. China's somewhat immature transportation methods and low-level laborers are now making great contributions to Sino-American trade. Before the war, the freight cost for each ton of goods transported from the Yangtze River to Chongqing was only 60 yuan. After the war, it cost 240 yuan to transport it via the Yuehan Railway, 1,000 yuan to transport it via Vietnam, and 10,000 yuan to transport it via the Yunnan-Burma Road. In terms of route, half of it had to pass through the Asian region, which was 3,300 miles, and the means of transportation were very complicated, with limited carrying capacity, and required manual assistance. The work was both complicated and, due to air raids, there was no loss. However, the Chinese people have always been able to overcome this difficulty with their spirit of hard work and sacrifice. This is something that should be especially praised when we commemorate Sino-American Trade Week, and we urge American people to give them enthusiastic support. Currently, the inland has a large workforce and abundant products, and transportation is also more convenient than in the early days of the war. Therefore, the basic conditions for Sino-American trade have been met. Therefore, we can firmly believe that the trade between China and the United States will have greater development in the future."</p>
<p>The United States is the Most Valued Customer in the Far East</p>
<p>In his speech, Counselor Coulter first mentioned that Shanghai's import trade this year has greatly increased, but we must pay attention to the fact that some of the practical goods can be replaced by Chinese goods. It is not a good phenomenon to replace Chinese goods with foreign goods. Regarding the difficulty of transporting American goods to China, Coulter also explained that the United States is actively expanding its military equipment, which has hindered the production of other aspects. For example, the current maximum output of steel is 83 million tons per year, but the domestic consumption in the United States is 110 million to 120 million tons. Therefore, the production of various industries in the United States is currently insufficient. If Shanghai wants to purchase American goods, the difficulty will inevitably increase. Coulter also said that the United States is the best customer in the Far East, purchasing more goods each year than it sells to the Far East. He firmly believes that the United States will pay attention to the resources that flow to the Far East in the future, which will benefit the people of the countries concerned.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Messages from the American Government and Public</p>
<p>(1) US Secretary of Commerce Jones sent a congratulatory message, saying, "On behalf of the US Department of Commerce, I would like to extend my warm regards to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai on the occasion of the Sino-American Trade Week banquet held in Shanghai. You are still able to continue to shoulder your admirable work in Shanghai as usual, and you have not been deterred by the difficulties in Shanghai and other places. In addition to congratulating you, I wish you all success in your efforts. (2) US Chamber of Commerce President Hawkes's congratulatory message said, "We who are participating in the commemoration of Sino-American Trade Week here would like to extend our sincere congratulations to the business leaders in China. We express our gratitude for your continued efforts to promote commercial and cultural relations between China and the United States." (3) US Foreign Trade Association President Farrell's congratulatory message said, "I sincerely and enthusiastically join you in commemorating Sino-American Trade Week, and I can assure you that when you encounter special difficulties, we will make every effort to promote trade relations between China and the United States with the utmost urgency." (4) Newly appointed US Ambassador to China Gauss's congratulatory message said, "I deeply regret that I am unable to attend today's grand banquet to commemorate Sino-American Trade Week and celebrate with you. But I remember when I decided to go to Shanghai, I heard that the American community still had the determination to continue operating its business. I am deeply grateful for this. Therefore, I can now assure you that I will do my best to protect American interests in Shanghai and other parts of China in order to promote trade between China and the United States."</p>

<p>Since the Concession authorities directly ordered a large quantity of Yangon special small-grain rice from the Hong Kong government, it has been widely sold in the retail departments of rice shops in this city, with remarkable results, greatly benefiting the common people. However, there are indeed unscrupulous rice merchants who, with malicious intent, dare to outwardly comply but inwardly defy, adulterating the rice for sale and deceiving residents. The Shi Changyi Rice Shop at No. 225 Jaxi Road in the French Concession was found to be</p>
<p>Attempting to Sell Mixed Rice</p>
<p>While selling Hong Kong rice yesterday, a secret agent dispatched by the French Bureau was present and discovered that the Hong Kong rice sold by the shop</p>
<p>was different from the samples. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed mixed with inferior grains, attempting to sell it for profit. The secret agent reported the actual situation to the French Concession authorities, stating that the rice shop had violated the regulations for selling rice. It is now known that the shop's business license has been revoked by the French authorities, ordering it to cease operations. Two or three other rice shops have also been penalized by the authorities for adulteration. Furthermore, Zhao Junsun, the owner of Yongchang Rice Shop at No. 278 Datong Road in the Public Concession, was found on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 20th) by a Western police officer to have sold the Municipal Council's affordable Hong Kong rice with suspected adulteration. The Western police officer reported the information to the Municipal Council, and in the afternoon at 3 p.m., the Municipal Council, together with Xiang Mao Foreign Firm, sent personnel to investigate. Whether there was adulteration could not be ascertained at that time. However, it is heard that Xiang Mao Foreign Firm has already decided to revoke the rice shop's right to sell the Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Purchase of French</p>
<p>The temporary restrictions on the sale of rice have been lifted, so factories and schools in this city are purchasing in large quantities from various rice shops. Yesterday, Pinghe Foreign Firm at No. 4 Beijing Road, due to its large number of employees, purchased 1,000 bags from a nearby rice shop. The rice shop, considering the large quantity, did not dare to sell rashly and applied to Xiang Mao Foreign Firm, which sent personnel to Pinghe Foreign Firm to verify the facts and granted permission for the sale. If similar situations occur in other rice shops, they must also apply to Xiang Mao and can only trade after permission is granted.</p>
<p>Rice Cart Allocation</p>
<p>The strike by rice cart workers has been resolved. It is stipulated that from now on, rice transportation should first be done by rubber-wheeled carts, with any excess transported by trucks, restoring the pre-war state. (2) To prevent disputes over rice transportation, the number of rubber-wheeled carts is set at 250 to 300, and the number of rice trucks is set at 40. (3) To prevent rice-grabbing incidents, an inspection team is organized to monitor each rice warehouse. (4) The words "Rubber Rice Cart" and a number are affixed to the carts to prevent other rubber carts from fraudulently engaging in transportation. The cart workers have also agreed with the Rice Merchants Association to abolish the long-term contract system and organize a Rice Cart Company. In the future, all rice shops must notify the Rice Cart Company when shipping goods, and the company will allocate work. This should come into effect next month.

<h3 id="e42">Initial Signs of a Coal Price Drop; Price per Ton Has Fallen by Forty to Fifty Yuan from Its Peak; Retail Coal Ball Prices Fall, But Large Factories Still Try to Control Them <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the coal market has seen an increasing abundance of spot goods. Holders of goods are all lowering prices to seek sales. Not only has the informal market gradually disappeared, but also the prices of various types of bituminous coal in the market have continued to decline. On average, the price per ton of coal has fallen by as much as forty to fifty yuan compared to its peak. Spot</p>
<p>Lack of Consultants: It is said that the market price of various types of bituminous coal in this city is currently unstable and will soon experience a sharp decline. However, the prices offered by holders of goods have been quite disparate recently. Dateli white coal is offered at some with 415 yuan, while some offer at 411 or 412 yuan, and Kaiping No. 1 lump is priced at 370 or 380 yuan. As for the coal ball factory prices, although they still maintain the original price of 296 yuan per ton, the informal market has fallen directly from 330 yuan to around 270 yuan. Retailers of various coal merchants also</p>
<p>Lowered Values for Sale: Prices are uncertain at 14 yuan and 15 yuan, mostly at 14.5 yuan, but a few large coal ball factories are still unwilling to lower the original price and are still thinking of struggling. The reasons for this decision on the decline in coal prices are approximately as follows: (1) The authorities of the two concessions have shifted their attention and are paying attention to the scope of activities of coal merchants, so speculative coal merchants are not only frightened, but also subject to many constraints; (2) The number of coal transport ships has increased, the source of bituminous coal has surged, the inventory is full, and the spot goods in the market are sluggish; (3) The climate has turned hot, the use of coal has decreased, and the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, so holders of goods are eager to sell and realize cash to facilitate turnover.</p>

<p>Reuters Employees: Loyal Service; The Company and Employees Have Long Had an Understanding; Private Membership in Groups Is Unrelated to the Company</p>
<p>Reuters News: It is easy to cause misunderstanding that there have recently been activities to organize groups among the workers of Reuters News Agency in this city. Reuters hereby declares the truth. The so-called organization of groups has been denied by the workers, and they have stated that they will abide by the company's rules and serve loyally. What the company cares about is the service and dedication of its employees. As for the private affairs of employees joining legal groups outside of work, the company does not want to interfere. The company and its employees have long had an understanding. If employees have complaints, the company is happy to consider them and do its best to ensure that they can work with peace of mind. All kinds of rumors are not credible.</p>

<p>Most of the American women and children in Shanghai have withdrawn, and the number of students at the Shanghai American School on Beidang Road has sharply decreased, so it has been temporarily suspended, and there is no hope of reopening for a while. It is now heard that the authorities are currently considering leasing the school playground separately to the French Police Department and the Western YMCA for use as sports fields, which is quite likely to be realized. Most of the current American School staff have left Shanghai, and another group is also about to leave. The school building is left to the care of staff member Kinna. When the school will resume classes cannot be said, but the school board will consider the possibility of resuming classes as soon as the number of American children in Shanghai increases.</p>

<p>Grade B Barber Shop Labor Dispute: Forcibly Striking and Causing Trouble</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute over barber shops violating regulations, the guild stated that the Xu Dengji Barber Shop on Zhejiang Road has followed the mediation record and has not deviated in the slightest since the labor and capital signed the conditions. Xu Dengji is indeed a Grade B shop with a 3-5 split of income and two porridges and one meal. However, the workers unilaterally demanded two meals and one porridge, and suddenly on May 15th, they all left the shop and went on strike automatically. Xu Dengji was forced to recruit new workers and continue to operate normally. Suddenly, on the morning of the 20th of this month, the trade union led dozens of workers, with great momentum, along the north end of Shandong Road, Shanxi Road, and Avenue Edward VII, forcing workers in various barber shops to go on strike immediately. Most workers were unwilling to strike, and workers fought each other, but soon all resumed work. The labor unrest ended two hours later.</p>

<p>— Liu</p>
<p>After coming out of the first-grade classroom, I returned to the various parts of the first floor of the foreign-style house I had just visited to observe. There were classrooms, handicraft rooms, and a school for the deaf and mute. Some of the students in the deaf and mute school were having Chinese class, and some were learning abacus with written calculations. I asked curiously, can a mute pronounce words and read books? They said: Yes; that is, under the instruction of a kind of gesture, he actually read the Chinese sentences in the textbook one by one, but his pronunciation was more clumsy and not as clear as ordinary people! However, the ability of a mute to speak was previously considered impossible, but now, with the development of educational technology, it is possible to make up for natural defects!</p>
<p>In addition, there are five parts, which are places for graduate students to learn skills. The overall leader is Father Lu, and each part has Chinese and Western leaders who manage and specialized technicians to guide them. The five parts are:</p>
<p>(1) Graphics Department: Divided into watercolor, pencil, oil painting, and colored glass;</p>
<p>(2) Printing Department: Divided into lithography, letterpress printing, and color printing;</p>
<p>(3) Carpentry Department: Divided into production, sampling, carving, and painting;</p>
<p>(4) Hardware Department: Divided into gilding, silver plating, and sand casting;</p>
<p>(5) Photography Department: Divided into copper plate, zinc plate, and glass plate;</p>
<p>We visited part by part, spending a full three hours, and it was still a hasty visit. I excerpted Wu Jizha's words as the conclusion of my visit, the so-called "there is nothing more to add to this, it is the ultimate!" Indeed, integrating labor and study, no one is abandoned and nothing is wasted, everyone does their best, and everyone gets what they need. If this spirit is promoted to various undertakings, I can say that no undertaking will fail.</p>
<p>The handicrafts produced by the institute are all exquisite; the products of the carpentry department and the hardware department are all exquisitely made, large and small, of various shapes and colors. I saw that most of the buyers were Westerners, who traveled far to Tushan Bay to buy, which shows that the credibility of the products is very strong, so they can be sold to Southeast Asia, India, and the United States and France. The products of the graphics department won as many as nineteen awards at the Nanyang Industrial Exposition; they were also displayed at the Nanjing National Products Exhibition and won many awards. However, the product that can be called the only one in the Far East is the colored glass; the figures are painted on it, and after special treatment, they will never fade. The various statues displayed in the carving department are the ones we see in the church, lined up here. There is also a statue of Xu Guangqi, wearing a red robe and gauze hat, with vivid expression. In addition, bronze statues are also made for people. I once saw a half-length statue, which is said to be made for a Chen family in Pudong.</p>
<p>The factory part is a production undertaking, which is not only sufficient to be self-sufficient, but also the income from the sale of industrial products accounts for the main part of the orphanage's income; now it is not, the mainland is cut off due to traffic obstructions, which is equivalent to being cut off; overseas, the European war is spreading, and sales are declining. In addition, what it relies on to pay for expenses is the donations from Chinese and Western people.</p>

<p>Wang Shen, a woman from Suzhou, 43 years old, was walking along Avenue Edward VII opposite the Gongwu Stage at 12:30 noon yesterday, intending to cross the road from north to south. A public bus happened to be parked at the station. The woman crossed in front of the public bus. Unexpectedly, a China Moving Company truck, No. 17042, drove out from behind the public bus. The driver of the truck (No. 431) saw a woman crossing the road ahead and could not brake in time, causing it to hit her. As the woman was lying on the ground, a Westerner's car came speeding from towards the west, hitting her again and injuring her brain. Blood flowed from her mouth and nose, and she was dying. A nearby Chinese police officer summoned an ambulance and sent her to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of her injuries, she died soon after. A reporter from this newspaper happened to be passing by and witnessed the tragic scene. He quickly took out his camera and photographed the situation.

<p>Yesterday morning at 8:40 AM, five robbers suddenly broke into Yuan Yu Exchange House, located on the second floor, rooms 209 and 210, of the building at No. 40 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Jiangxi Road. They robbed the business of 62,000 yuan in legal tender and 4,496 yuan in Japanese military currency. They attempted to escape with the loot but one robber was apprehended. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Bound Employees</p>
<p>At the time, five robbers, one wearing a gray short-sleeved shirt and shorts, and the others wearing blue long gowns, walked up to the second floor and burst into room 205. Two robbers pulled out handguns, threatening the four employees inside, forbidding them from making a sound, and demanding the key to the safe. However, the employees did not have the key and could not hand it over. The robbers then used hemp rope to bind the four employees and a tea servant, forcing them to sit and wait for other employees who arrived later. These arriving employees were also intercepted and confined in room 210.</p>
<p>Stole Liberally and Left</p>
<p>It was not until 9:30 AM that the manager of the exchange house, Gao Guangcai, walked in confidently. Upon seeing the situation, he knew it was difficult to escape. The robbers threatened him with a gun, forcing him to hand over the safe key. Gao had no choice but to comply, allowing the robbers to steal 62,000 yuan in legal tender and 4,496 yuan in Japanese military currency, which were deposited by a cloth company from Wuxi. They packed the money and attempted to flee downstairs. A nearby patrolman heard the commotion and immediately reported to the police station. A large number of detectives were dispatched by car to the scene to surround and search the building. One robber wearing short-sleeved shirt and shorts was captured on the spot at the entrance. 30,000 yuan of the stolen money was recovered. Two suspects were also apprehended. The people and the recovered money were taken back to the police station. The employees of the exchange house were also asked to identify the robbers and the remaining robbers are being pursued.</p>
<p>Car Insurance Policy Transfer Dispute - Datong Company Wins Lawsuit</p>
<p>Datong Company, located at 1460 Jing'an Temple Road, had a dispute with Wu Ruisheng regarding the transfer of a car insurance policy. The two parties were unable to resolve the issue, so Wu filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, seeking 6,068.71 yuan in damages. Wu had purchased a Nash car from Datong Company, and Datong issued an insurance policy stating that free repairs would be provided within three months. Later, Wu sold the car to someone else and requested that Datong transfer the insurance policy. Datong refused, arguing that the policy had expired and that the car had never been inspected as required during the policy period, making a transfer impossible according to the agreement. As a result, Wu was unable to sell the car. Although he later sold it to another buyer, the selling price was reduced. Wu considered this a loss and filed a lawsuit. After several court hearings, the court ruled in favor of Datong Company, dismissing the plaintiff's claim and ordering Wu Ruisheng to bear the litigation costs.</p>
<p>Robbers Steal Car - False Rumor of Wang Shuxian Being Kidnapped</p>
<p>Yesterday, various newspapers reported that Wang Yiting's third son, Wang Shuxian, was kidnapped along with his car in front of the Paramount Ballroom. It has been clarified that this was a false rumor. The previous evening, Wang drove his private car, number 1317, to the ballroom. The driver, Shen Genquan, parked the car nearby. Around 11:40 PM, Wang had not yet emerged from the ballroom. Suddenly, three robbers opened the car door. Shen, who was leaning back in his seat, dozing off, was awakened by the robbers. As he was about to ask what they wanted, he saw the robbers brandishing pistols. He was forced to allow the three robbers to get into the car and ordered to drive west. At the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road, the robbers pushed Shen out of the car and drove away themselves, disappearing without a trace. The stolen car has not yet been recovered as of yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Grains - Without the Public Sale of Rice by the Bureau of Public Works, How Could the Rice Market Have Collapsed So Completely? - Indirectly Lowered the Shipping Costs from Rangoon <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market fluctuated again, initially weakening before rising, ultimately trending towards weakness again. When the market opened in the morning, due to the prevailing weakness of the previous day, the prices of all grades of rice continued to decline. After prices fell, actual sales by local merchants and low-price buying by new speculators caused the market to rise again, with prices increasing by a small amount of one or two yuan in the morning and rising by three or four yuan at noon. However, in the later market, sales by foreign merchants and confirmation of lower shipping costs caused the market to fall again. As a result, the final prices were still weaker than the previous evening. Small-grained rice opened at 104 yuan, falling to 102 yuan, and then rising to 107.5 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was at its lowest at 111 yuan, and then rose to 114 yuan. No. 2 ranged from 103 yuan to 106 yuan. Siamese No. 1 ranged from 106 yuan to 108-9 yuan, once falling to 99 yuan, and then rising to 102 yuan. Yinghua Company's Saigon No. 1 rice for April/May delivery was 132.5 yuan to 135 yuan, small pattern rice was 129 yuan to 127 yuan, and broken rice was 95 yuan to 99 yuan. In the afternoon, Dafu Foreign Firm sold 1,000 tons of small-grained rice for June delivery, with buyers bidding 116 yuan, and it was rumored that a deal was made at 127 yuan. Because shipping costs have been confirmed to be lower, with Rangoon freight rates, formerly 220 shillings per ton, now only 150 shillings, the cost has decreased, and future shipments can be continuously arranged. Therefore, market sentiment was weak, and both spot and futures prices were lowered by two or three yuan. The total daily turnover was 27,000 bags of spot rice, and Yinghua Company also had several thousand tons.</p>
<p>Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica rice, was generally weaker in the early market due to the continued decline in foreign rice. Most dealers feared another storm and were unwilling to hold firm, and local shops were also unusually quiet, so prices fell by two yuan. Wuxi fresh white japonica rice was 132 yuan, Kun japonica rice was 130 yuan, then falling to 126 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice was 127-8 yuan, then falling to 124 yuan, with original packaging at 128 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, after a brief rebound in the previous market, saw a renewed decline in demand. At the same time, many holders were eager to sell at the higher prices, resulting in oversupply and difficulty in maintaining prices, falling by one or two yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong white glutinous rice was 110 yuan to 108 yuan, glutinous tea was 100 yuan to 98 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice was 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour Market Hovering Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was similar to that of foreign flour, having entered a hovering state. Trading in the morning was particularly quiet. Dealers, considering that the cost of raw materials for Chinese mills' commonly sold flour remained high at 29 yuan, which was higher than current prices for foreign flour, were unwilling to lower prices further. However, there was no strong demand from buyers, and trading was stagnant. Only 500 bags of Pao Tai brand American flour were traded, priced at 29.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation improved slightly, as some merchants made small purchases at low prices, and the price of Pao Tai flour rose to 29.5 yuan. However, Golden Dragon flour continued to be affected by large inventories and dumping by other brands, and the market remained difficult to improve. Golden Dragon flour was priced at 28.1 to 28.3 yuan, and Double Eagle brand flour was priced at 28.5 yuan, with some differences in actual prices. Pao Tai flour rose by 0.2 yuan, while Golden Dragon flour fell slightly by 0.3 yuan. The market has entered a hovering state. The commonly sold flour remained unchanged, but the retail prices of Fuxin and Navy Ship brands at various stores had been raised to 30.05 yuan. Today, 2,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Wheat - Yesterday's wheat market remained quiet. Because old wheat had already been ordered to be taken down, the flour mills were waiting for the new wheat to come on the market before buying. The market has been stagnant for a long time. It is said that the actual price of Gao Du wheat old stocks remains between 45 and 46 yuan per 100 catties, which can be described as having a price but no market.</p>

<p>Recently, orchid bamboo shoots have been in short supply, with inventories dwindling daily, and market prices have long been rising. The prices of goods from these shops have also risen accordingly. It is said that dozens of pieces have been sold, rising more than ten yuan compared to the previous period.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes - Soybean Cake Futures Actively Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains and oil cake market was characterized by diverse opinions, leading to a general consolidation. Prices for soybean oil were unchanged, but corn suddenly rose by more than one yuan at the close (more than 2,000 bags traded). Soybean cake prices were flat in the morning but rose at noon, ultimately falling again, with the closing market also showing a weak pattern.

<p>Finance - Hong Kong Limits Prices - Closing to Take in US Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw rates listed, with the rates announced at 9:30 AM. The British exchange rate was listed at 0.0625, calculated at three pence one eight seven five. The new exchange rate was listed at 0.25, and the Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates were listed at approximately 0.275. Exchange rates for American, French and German currency were steady, but had no market. The informal British and American exchange market reversed in direction, softening. Consequently, Chinese merchants and speculators started to offset previously held short positions, and since foreign merchants were in need to reduce positions it was unexpected when Hong Kong telegraphed less offers. Later, Hong Kong suddenly limited the price of US dollars to 5.40625 yuan, and had to take in 200,000 US dollars, while the price of gold was bid up to 6400 yuan. The British exchange was weakened down to the close, trading at three pence two nine six eight seven five, and US dollars trading at 5.375 yuan. The price of gold was pushed up to the close. Trading for half the day was active. There was no market on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Extends Limits, Reverses Informal Market</p>
<p>From the morning wires, rates for Indian and British silver were flat and the foreign rates for currency were similar between America and England. In the morning banks in Shanghai started with a selling price of three pence three one two five for the British exchange rate, and 5.40625 yuan for American exchange rates. In an instance, the prices from the top level were hard to settle, but at 9:20 AM, the Hong Kong wire came with the sale of a limited few and US dollars were sold at 5.40625 yuan from the Chinese banks and an American bank that offered the same price at the same time. The Shanghai and Hong Kong Bank marked up the rate for American currency, while the silver tax balanced at 24.25 percent. Speculators tried to offset previously held short positions and it was overheard that the Hong Kong wire was offering 5.40625 yuan, bringing in a large amount, leaving the banks not as willing to offer. Speculators bid on 5.375 yuan for May and June, causing the currency market to soften. The British rate then tightened up, where at the close of 12 AM, the British currency was offered at three pence two nine six eight seven five and the US currency was offered at 5.375 yuan, causing the British rate to tighten up at 0.015625 and the American rate to tighten up at 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Rate at 2.5 yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, the 20th (Wednesday), this morning the exchange market opened steady, without any changes to English, American or Japanese rates.

<p>Gold Market Offset Short Positions and Prices Climb - Spot Prices Must Be 300 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday's informal gold market rebounded and prices climbed, breaking through the 6,400 yuan mark, as rumors of negative news subsided. Foreign exchange was tightened by speculators covering short positions and by Hong Kong's price limits and aggressive buying. All parties' confidence improved, and securities firms covered short positions and increased holdings, while retail investors bought in, so despite the emergence of Xin Feng Yong, a bill merchant, to sell, demand still exceeded supply. Prices rose from 6,385 yuan in the morning to 6,420 yuan, a rebound of 42 yuan. The total trading volume for half a day was 32,000 taels. There was no market outside the exchange in the afternoon. The backwardation (May rolling into June) continued to rise. The seller, Defu, offered 320 taels to the buyer, Shi He, at a price of 72 yuan, then offered 200 taels to Decheng at 75 yuan, and then increased the price by 10 yuan. Cash gold was offered by Hong Kang Yong, and sold by Chengji, at 50 taels at a price 290 yuan higher than the futures price. Tianyuan offered 90 taels, and Dafeng and Hesheng each offered 50 taels, all bought by Junxiang He, at 285 yuan higher. Yongcheng offered 20 taels, and Feng offered 100 taels, all bought by Chengji, at 300 yuan higher, about 60 yuan higher than the previous day. Jewelry gold was also listed up 5 yuan, to 690 yuan. Customs gold and other types of gold were unchanged.</p>
<p>Refined Gold Rebounds Four Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Beginning at 9:15 AM, the June contract (10 taels per bar) opened at 10 yuan higher, at 6,385 yuan. Defu, Xinyuan, Dafeng, and Shi He actively bought in, continuing to push up the price by 25 yuan, breaking through 6,400 yuan, reaching 6,410 yuan, which was sold by Chengji, Xinfeng Yong, Gonghe, and Chi Da. Furthermore, with the next month's dollar price at 5.40625 yuan, sold by an American bank, the price fell back 23 yuan, to 6,387 yuan, and was bought by Tong Kang Yong and Yi Da Securities Firms. It hovered around 6,400 yuan, with retail short positions being covered, rising to 6,415 yuan. Then, Chengji and Xinfeng Yong emerged to sell, pushing the price down to 6,395 yuan. And hearing that next month's dollar was also softening to 5.375 yuan, Xinyuan, Tong Kang Yong, Yi Da, Chi Da, Defu, and other securities firms absorbed, gradually rising to 6,420 yuan, finally reaching 6,413 yuan. At noon, the closing price was 6,417 yuan, a rebound of 42 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Based on the closing price of 6,479.07 yuan for the June dollar at 5.375 yuan, there was a difference of 62.07 yuan. After closing, the price rose to 6,420 yuan, and finally settled at 6,417-18 yuan. The difference in the morning was 35 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon. The selling price of this brand of cash gold from cash gold dealers was 310 yuan higher than the refined gold futures price. The buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price.

<p>The price of silver jewelry was raised by five yuan at 10:30 AM by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, listing it at 690 yuan, with the buying price reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Most Foreign Currencies Weakened</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both spot and futures prices for refined gold rise. British and American gold pounds also rose by one yuan each. British gold notes remained fixed and the market price stabilized. The US dollar opened at 1.6 jiao and then fell back to 1.5 jiao, closing at 18.23 yuan, an increase of eight fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes remained in ample supply and the market price trended weaker. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended lower, with the former falling to 2.04 yuan and the latter falling to 1.73 yuan.</p>
<p>Central Government Auxiliary Coins, Damaged Notes - to be Exchanged by 20 Tobacco Exchange Dealers</p>

In view of this, the Central Bank has specially entrusted 20 tobacco exchange dealers in Shanghai to be responsible for the exchange, without collecting any fees. The exchange will be carried out in accordance with the Central Bank's procedures, and will start on June 1. At that time, ticket holders can exchange at the designated merchants, which is very convenient. (Kun)</p>
<p>Spot Exchange and Remittance Almost Equalized</p>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange and remittance bills continued to decline, with the discount rate for every thousand yuan falling to as low as five jiao, and the selling rate was one yuan, 1.25 yuan lower than the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained at seven fen for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<p>Securities - Public Debt Transactions Sluggish</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public debt was extremely dull yesterday. The market was largely controlled by a small group of holders, and as the interest payment date approached, those holding short positions were content and reluctant to take any further action. Both buyers and sellers were hesitant, and it is expected that this situation will not last long. In the morning, Hu He Xun, Shen Chang, and Lian Yi bought, while Run De, Yi Tai, and Hong Da sold, causing the market price to weaken slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Trading was even quieter in the afternoon. Tong Shun and De Chang bought, while Yi Xing and Ding Kang sold, but the market price of all five types of bonds remained unchanged, at the same price as the morning close, resulting in a slight decrease of 0.1-0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 7-800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 86.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market for various industries remained quiet, with sluggish trading. The market price rose slightly overall. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Tuesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and shares of various British companies in the Far East remained flat. Shares of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation registered in England rose by one pound to 74 pounds. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton - With Bulls and Bears Contending, the Yarn Market Wants to Rise But Stops - One Side Sees Tight Warehouse Receipts and Refuses to Loosen, the Other Side Sees Sluggish Yarn Sales and Does Not Allow Optimism</p>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, rebounded again, but actual business was unusually sluggish. Hong Kong merchants only handled 50 bales, and other merchants had no activity at all. However, holders with sufficient capital were unwilling to give up their absorption of the 20s Double Horse factory order, so apart from fluctuations in standard yarn, everything was completely stagnant. However, the bulls argued that warehouse receipts were tight and could not be loosened, while the bears, considering the lack of sales for 20s yarn and the fact that the price of Double Horse yarn was particularly high, making it increasingly difficult to sell miscellaneous brands of yarn, coupled with the fact that the yarn sales season was ending, predicted that the future would not be optimistic. Therefore, the high price was 1,447 yuan and the low price was 1,426 yuan. In the afternoon, the upward momentum was quite strong, rising to 1,452 yuan. Then, it was heard that a certain standard yarn 20s yarn for this month closed at only 1,175 yuan, a significant difference compared to Double Horse yarn. Those who profited sold, and new buyers emerged, falling to 1,435 yuan, with the final price being 1,435-6 yuan. Today, 125 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Siam and 270 bales are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The market was flat in the morning for Double Horse yarn, but most of the traders on the floor were actively buying in anticipation of a rise. The opening price was 1,435 yuan, soon rising to 43 yuan, but there was no shortage of sellers, and it eased to 1,437 yuan. Then, hearing that spot gold rebounded, it slowly rose to 1,446 yuan, but the atmosphere in the market was quite deceptive. By the time of closing, the bulls were active again, mostly rolling over futures, briefly rising to 1,449 yuan, but spot yarn trading was sluggish. According to statistics, 10,750 bales were traded during the day. The amounts purchased by various merchants are listed as follows: Hong Kong 50, and Tong Hang 10,700, for a total of 10,750 bales.</p>
<p>If the Price of Yarn Does Not Rise, It Is Difficult to Expect a Recovery in the Cotton Market</p>
<p>Due to the small amount of yarn exports and sluggish prices, the prices for the miscellaneous brands of yarn are very low, and inventories are overstocked. So cotton sales are also affected. However, market situation of raw materials for fine yarn is another matter, but trading is not strong. Yesterday, only 200 bales of Tongzhou wood frame cotton were traded, and the price of 47 yuan was the number-to-number trade.</p>
<p>According to other news, the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai foreign firms is weak, and the situation is sluggish. Yesterday, 200 bales of high-grade West Cotton were transshipped to Qingdao, and the selling price was only about 410 yuan, a difference of 10 yuan compared with the highest selling price, so it is impossible to look forward to a recovery of the cotton market in the near future.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially rose due to buying by fellow traders, but then fell slightly due to sales in New Orleans and some liquidation. As a result, the closing price was 8-9 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was quite weak, and the market fell due to a large amount of bull liquidation. Yesterday's closing prices all fell by 2-9 points, and the opening market today is expected to be one point higher.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Textiles: Factory Cloth Market Conditions are Grim – Market Declines Daily – <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's factory cloth market showed a weakening trend. Sales offers saw slight increases but quickly retreated due to the approaching month-end futures delivery date. Stockpilers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and actual sales were slow. Dye factories suspended production of gray cloth, leading to an oversupply. Consequently, cloth prices continued their downward spiral. Yesterday's closing prices all showed declines, with fine white cloth falling by 50 cents, and coarse cloth and twill falling by 25 to 50 cents. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged, but most businesses were not actively trading. Only a few hundred pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, etc., were transacted in this market. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders continued to declare shipments, but interest in purchasing new goods was also weak.</p>
<p>On the 21st, 1,440 pieces of textiles were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 205 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth started with an upward trend but ultimately weakened. However, the spot market sentiment was still good. At the opening, high-grade fine cloth once rose to $47.10, but later it continued to decline based on exchange standards, closing at $46.65, a rise of 50 cents per piece. Dyed Four Gentlemen broadcloth at $1.435 also rose by 1 cent.</p>
<p>Autumn and Winter Woolens Hoarded</p>
<p>Yesterday, woolen fabric and towel surfaces were stable, while summer white goods remained weak. Autumn demand focused on Xuanwei flannel, suit woolens, single-sided woolens, four-ply Harris tweed, Wu Zhi Gong gabardine, checkered Gong board flannel, medium-thick broadcloth Hailing tweed, riding breeches woolens, and cashmere. Winter demand focused on plain-colored "Dao Chun Mao" cashmere fabric, hair woolens, pearl woolens, cloud pattern woolens, carved patterns, silver-seized various overcoat woolens, Mairden plain thick woolens, "Hai Bai Long Ma" and lamb fleece felt, and shoe woolens, etc., which remained consistently strong. Market sentiment was quite bullish, with prices being whatever the seller asked, without any standard prices.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Slightly Tight <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced a slight tightening trend due to the extremely limited number of sellers of coarse white sugar for late May delivery. Although goods en route could arrive in Shanghai within the month, customs clearance procedures would prevent delivery within the month. The association's market prices for spot goods of 1-4 coarse white sugar, and imported goods arriving in March and April, were $103.80 to $104.20, an increase of 70 cents. The initial price for futures for the end of this month was $104.50, $104, $104.50, then rising to $105, $106, and closing at $105.10, up 35 cents. Trading for goods arriving on June 10th also began, opening at $105.60, slightly softening to $104.50, $105 during the day, and then firming up again to $105.60, $105.80. Taikoo granulated white sugar B mark Western warehouse was $107.50, up 50 cents, and HX mark Western warehouse was $98, up $1. Yesterday, 15,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Fuel Problem (Continued): When Will It Fall to the Price of Rice? <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Coal briquettes are supposedly machine-made, but recently, some coal shops have also been making them by hand, using coal dust left over from coal chunks and coal briquettes. They use an iron coal briquette mold, fill it with the mixed coal dust, close it, and then the usual coal briquette is formed. After drying it in the sun, it can be sold. Chinese merchants are able to make the most of waste materials, regardless of labor costs, which is one of the reasons for their success. Because coal briquettes are too expensive, there is even a type of coal-saving powder sold in the market. According to its advertising, two cents' worth of powder can save one dollar's worth of coal briquettes. I have not tried it, but I imagine it is some kind of combustion aid. However, it can also be called being good at speculation.</p>
<p>In the past, water boilers and public bathhouses used flower husks (i.e., cottonseed hulls) instead of coal. This was a big thing during the Guangxu era. Later, coal prices were cheap, and the supply of flower husks was limited, so coal was used more often. Recently, coal prices have been too high, and the Ningbo Lighters Association has added restrictions, so fuel for various factories is a big problem. As a result, the use of flower husks as a substitute for coal has resurfaced. The oil factory that supplies the most flower husks in Shanghai is the Dayouyu Oil Factory on West Suzhou Road. Many factories and large spinning mills are placing daily orders for flower husks to be transported and used. The heat output is no less than that of coal, so its use is spreading. However, special stoves for flower husks need to be set up, and old coal stoves need to be modified. But flower husks are still difficult to use in homes. Coal briquettes and white coal are still indispensable fuels. We'll see when they can fall to the price of rice. (The End)</p>

<p>Provincial Yangzhou Middle School; Second-Year High School Students Resume Classes</p>
<p>The second-year high school students of the Provincial Yangzhou Middle School on Gao Naiyi Road in this city went on strike because their eight demands to the school authorities were not met. Fortunately, the school made sincere explanations to the students, and the matter was resolved satisfactorily yesterday.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Yang Dingba, a second-year B student at the school, was disorderly in history class and was given a major demerit and suspended from classes for three days by the school, which prevented him from taking the English exam. Although the student requested permission to take the exam, he was not allowed to. As a result, more than 90 second-year A and B students raised eight demands. Because the school did not respond to the demands, the second-year students began a strike at 8 a.m. the day before yesterday. The school made sincere explanations to the second-year students the day before yesterday, hoping that they would resume classes early. The students also expressed their willingness to accept, so classes were formally resumed by noon. The school also accommodated the students' final demand that the time of the strike not be counted as an unexcused absence. Thus, the strike was resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<h3 id="e56">How to Study Painting (III) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Once you understand how to write characters, you can start with simple paintings like plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums. Use the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting, which is published in the market, as a reference. For example, when painting orchids, you must first paint the leaves, clearly seeing the order of the strokes from left to right, slightly distinguishing the lightness and heaviness, and brushing them off smoothly. After one, two, or even eight or ten strokes, you will have confidence. When painting plum blossoms, you must first paint the branches, from top to bottom, painting them in a natural way to show the strength of the brush. Of course, there are different methods for painting bamboo and chrysanthemums. Orchid leaves should use dark ink, orchid flowers should use light ink, chrysanthemums should use dark ink, and chrysanthemum leaves should use light ink. There should also be changes within the darkness and lightness. As long as you practice carefully and boldly, and after some time you understand the methods of using the brush and ink, then you can copy more complex paintings. Before putting pen to paper, you must first carefully study the brushwork, composition, and artistic conception of the painting, as well as the various techniques, and then start copying to have good results. These plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums are all organizations of lines, and the lines all come from the skill on the tip of the brush. Chinese painting, whether landscapes, figures, or flowers and birds, is all made up of the combination and description of lines. If the lines can be changed, lively, experienced, and calm, then the painting will definitely be good. However, this line skill cannot be achieved overnight. You must have perseverance to practice, and at the same time, you must also see more works by famous artists, study them carefully, and make references, so that you will naturally get twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The study of Western painting completely relies on sketching as the only method, but it also starts with simple objects. According to the principles of distance, brightness, size, and perspective, compare the object and describe it with a pencil or charcoal to do basic exercises. After practicing, you can describe anything, whether static flowers, moving beasts, or the great natural scenery. From the perspective of Western painting, human body models are the most suitable objects. They have curvilinear beauty, color beauty, and spiritual beauty. Just look at the curves of the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose on the face, the four limbs, and the waist, chest, and back, which have the most changes. The color of the skin often changes the most because of the circulation of blood and the reflection of light. This kind of curvature and color is most abundant in the human body. Especially spiritual beauty is a unique strength of the human body. The expressions of joy, anger, sadness, and happiness, and the full and substantial spirit, are lacking in various objects or other animals. Therefore, human body sketching is the most important foundation in Western painting. You should first study human anatomy so that the outline can be accurate. Study optics and color science so that the changes in light and shade and the coordination of colors can achieve satisfactory results. When the sketching skills are mature, the foundation of Western painting will also be laid. Usually, before practicing the human body, use a plaster model as the object. Beginners can fully observe its outline and gradually practice from the local to the whole. If even the equipment of plaster models is not easy to obtain, then you can only start by copying model books like Chinese painting, first copying pencil drawings, then watercolors, and finally oil paintings. However, copying is only occasional and cannot be regarded as a normal method.</p>

<h3 id="e57">War Anxiety <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Li</p>
<p>In England, under intense bombing, most of the public displayed an indomitable spirit, but a very small number of people felt psychological unease due to the threat of war, developing a kind of anxiety and suffering from mild neurotic disorders.</p>
<p>These patients were immediately cured after being examined by psychiatrists. The prescriptions used by psychiatrists were only a few words.</p>
<p>Strangely, most of these patients suffering from war anxiety were very eager to show courage, afraid of showing fear of war in front of others and being ridiculed. Unexpectedly, this caused psychological anxiety.</p>
<p>For these patients, it is only necessary to explain to them that war is a terrible thing, and it is not shameful to show anxiety about war. Everyone's psychological reaction to war is almost the same.</p>
<p>However, clearly seeing the environment and not being afraid to face reality is the healthiest thing.</p>

<p>— Wave</p>
<p>For a long time, his image had gradually faded from my memory. Until today, when I saw his name in a book, a long, thin, sallow face with long hair reappeared in my mind.</p>
<p>Among my classmates, he was a thinker with a fresh perspective. He had imparted to me a lot of new knowledge, and several conversations had aroused in me a desire to "improve." He was extremely resentful of "ritualism" and often said, "I want to conquer ritualism."</p>
<p>One afternoon, on the lawn, I talked about my family. As I was immersed in my fantasy after finishing my story, I heard him say with a sigh, "You are much happier than I am." I was surprised and turned to look at him. Ah! I had never seen him with such a look in his eyes; a depressing secret seemed to lurk deep in his eyes. I couldn't help but ask him in a low voice.</p>
<p>"You would never think of it," he said, "You would never think of it. One cannot simply observe a person's daily expressions. Happy people often swallow tears in their hearts. Don't you see me always smiling? But the clouds of despair often surround my heart...</p>
<p>"One day when I was twelve years old, I was still an ignorant child. When I came home from school and stepped into the door, I found that there were more people in the house; they all looked at me with contempt and laughed and shouted, 'He's here, he's here.' I blushed inexplicably and ran shamefully towards my mother's room, but her room was also full of female relatives, who also looked at me with the same eyes and laughed. I lowered my head, and my heart began to stir.</p>
<p>"From that day on, there was one more person in the house... a girl, a child bride who was supposed to be my future wife. She brought me material to be made fun of, she brought the dark clouds that appeared when I had hope. My knowledge increased day by day, and at the same time, I felt more and more obscure about the future. When I was studying, I saw her, and my thoughts began to be confused, and my spirit began to groan. I felt that harm was useless. Could she save me? Of course, I could immediately disregard everything and jump out of this fire pit."</p>
<p>"Then, what kind of ending will that girl have?" I said in a daze.</p>
<p>"Yes, that is exactly the question that is tormenting me. Naturally, I can't abandon her, but will she be able to give me happiness in the future? She is an illiterate person!... I also thought about educating her, but when the two of us are in the same room, and even when we look at each other, we will be subjected to the family's, even the parents', snickers and humiliating glances; this will continue for several days, and you think I can still sit at the same desk with her and teach her to recognize the characters one by one?"</p>
<p>"In that case, besides your personal resistance, there is no other way? Think about it, even if you are victorious, what about her? Wouldn't she be trapped in an even deeper cellar? Don't forget, you are still a young man!"</p>
<p>"I am still... a young man," he said slowly, "But when you are put in this situation, what will you do?"</p>
<p>These words were like a piece of ice sliding down my neck and back. Yes, where is a young man not looking for opportunities to resist? Isn't he thinking of more ways than I am? A feeling of pain tightened my heart, and I couldn't help but blurt out, "This feudalism, this ritualism!"</p>

<h3 id="e59">Beauty <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>This morning, the teacher who teaches selections of modern literature brought a bunch of roses and gave each person a flower, saying that May had arrived. (A foreign woman would not understand the hearts of Chinese youth.)</p>
<p>Roses are beautiful and fragrant, and should be given to a friend, but my flower-loving friend has gone far away.</p>
<p>I took it home and put it on the table, which at least added some color to this monotonous room.</p>
<p>When I returned at night, it had already withered. I blamed myself for my negligence. Why didn't I put it in a vase sooner? So, I quickly turned around to find a vase and fill it with water; but, you know, its beauty was gone forever.</p>
<p>I remembered a story written by Hawthorne.</p>
<p>A strange old doctor obtained half a bottle of the elixir of life and invited four old men to visit. His miraculous experiment: a broken rose, worn by him at his wedding fifty-five years ago, was placed in the elixir and restored its long-lost color and fragrance.</p>
<p>The old doctor also said that the elixir could also make people young again, and the four old men shared the bottle of elixir. In an instant, they all regained their youth. They cheered, they sang, they danced, they argued, and the desolate universe also became lively.</p>

<h3 id="e60">The Silent Machine Gun <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Two Americans, William Hale and Duran Beem, have invented a new type of silent machine gun. It resembles a handheld machine gun and can fire 10,000 bullets per minute. The gun uses air pressure rather than gunpowder, so it does not have the clattering sound of a regular machine gun. During a recent test firing, it set a three-inch-thick oak board on fire and pierced the wire mesh of an aircraft shield. When firing, the gun body remains as cold as usual, unlike the heat generated by guns that use gunpowder. The illustration shows a steel plate riddled with bullet marks from the silent machine gun.</p>
<p>Tiredness finally overcame the "young people," and they sat down to rest. At this moment, the rose in the old doctor's hand withered, and after a short while, the youth of the four disappeared like smoke and clouds, returning them to their twilight years.</p>
<p>Friends, as you can see, the beauty of the rose is fleeting, and the beauty of youth is also fleeting. But do you know that there is an eternal beauty in the world that never fades?</p>
<h3 id="e61">Mechanized Lightning Army <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>U.S. Major General Chaffee is currently planning to form a "lightning army" with swift maneuverability as a deterrent against invaders landing in North or South America. Currently, the U.S. military's response is not quick enough; for example, if the German army were to launch a surprise landing in Brazil, the U.S. military would be somewhat out of reach. But in fact, if such an event were to occur, the U.S. military must be able to quickly deploy and defeat the German army. The formation of a mechanized lightning army is intended to answer blitzkrieg with blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>This force consists of seven mechanized divisions, each with 10,000 officers and soldiers, 287 light tanks, 120 medium tanks, and 1,328 other vehicles, including military trucks and motorcycles. Each division has mechanized infantry, reconnaissance units, mobile artillery, and aircraft reconnaissance units. They can "march" 150 miles overnight and arrive before dawn to intercept the enemy.</p>
<p>The main force of the lightning army is tanks, with strong firepower. Light tanks (weighing 8 to 15 tons) are equipped with three .30 caliber machine guns and one .37 caliber cannon; 23-ton tanks are equipped with one .37 caliber cannon and six .30 caliber machine guns. It is said that by June 1941, these seven lightning divisions will be fully equipped and trained. (Note: Germany currently also has seven lightning divisions, which have been trained for six years.)</p>

<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>He hardly ever smiled at other children. But today was a bit strange. Whenever he mentioned Meibao, his face would reveal a kind of affectionate smile that had never been seen before. The gauntness of his face and the listlessness of his spirit were also unusual for Qiu Haitang, because these were things that had never happened before, even when he was penniless.</p>
<p>"Second Brother, you look like you've been sick too..."</p>
<p>Yu Kun gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I won't bother you with my troubles! But that little girl of yours has really given me a hard time! I've been running a fever for days and nights, making me more tired than singing a double bill day and night. I was the one who went outside to get the doctor, dispense medicine, and buy things. I was also the one who took turns with the nanny to hold the child at night. I, Zhao, have never done this kind of woman's work in my life!" As he said this, he took off his long gown, crossed his leg, and sat on the edge of Qiu Haitang's bed. "Good brother, can I kowtow to you? Don't ask how much I love Meibao now, but if I keep guarding her at home like this all day long, I'll be useless in a few days! So, Third Brother, I beg you to take good care of yourself and take over this burden from me as soon as possible!"</p>
<p>Although Yu Kun still spoke with a bit of a joking tone, Qiu Haitang, who had always known his wild-horse-like character, couldn't help but feel grateful and tearful.</p>
<p>"Since you were so worried, why didn't you send someone to find me?" Qiu Haitang struggled to stretch out a hand from under the thin woolen blanket and grasped Yu Kun's arm. Yu Kun immediately gently freed himself and put it back in its original place.</p>
<p>"I was afraid that others would find out about that place... and that they might snatch little Meibao away..."</p>
<p>Yu Kun took out a wrinkled and bent cigarette from his pocket, rolled it in his palm, and then looked back at his sworn brother and said:</p>
<p>"Second Brother, can I ring for a box of matches?"</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Young Man Who Plays Old Men … A Special Feature on Wang Jixu … <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Those who have seen La Fei's "Home" probably still remember Wang Jixu, who played the old and frail Grandpa Gao! Look at his "old-fashioned" appearance on stage, how authentic it is! "This role must have originally been an old man, otherwise, how could he be able to act so much like one?" The audience probably thinks so! But who would know that he is just a young man in his twenties!</p>
<p>In today's drama and film industry, under the "spotlight above all" principle, those who are a little older will certainly not play anything other than "lead roles," and even those so-called "newcomers" who have just emerged are vying to play only "lead roles," even though their acting skills are not yet mature. Our Mr. Wang Jixu has been involved in theatrical life for a full ten years. His qualifications cannot be said to be not old. A few years ago, he even wrote, directed, and starred in "Su Wu Herding Sheep," and the results were really "not bad at all," but "once you become popular, people will be jealous of you," and he was thrown out by "those people" like that. In a fit of anger, he devoted himself to the film circle. Now, spoken drama is slowly rising again. "Real gold is not afraid of fire after all," and he was invited back to the spoken drama world.</p>
<p>From his name – "Jixu" – you can tell that he is a homeless wanderer. He is struggling hard in this great era. He is still studying at Great China University and teaching at a middle school at the same time. Truly, it can be said that he is so busy that he can't even catch his breath: going to university to study; going to middle school to teach; going to the movie theater to film; going to the drama theater to act; recently, he has also been writing a Qing Dynasty palace story. Therefore, "Haoli Sheng" (a type of stimulant) is being consumed bottle after bottle. He is still in an "old" tone!</p>
<p>"Ah! I've lost fifteen pounds recently!" he once said to me.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more thing that should be mentioned. On stage, he speaks fluent Mandarin, but off stage, he is full of "ala" "ala" Ningbo dialect. When asked why he doesn't speak Mandarin, his answer is: "Ala is a Ningbo person!"</p>
<h3 id="e64">Chronicle of a City of Sorrow <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Xiao</p>
<p>Following "Sai Jinhua," "Under the Roofs of Shanghai," and "Wedding Night" (originally titled "One Year"), Xia Yan has a new work, "Chronicle of a City of Sorrow," being staged at the Lyceum Theatre. This play is about the failure of speculators who hoard goods to drive up prices, and it serves as a wake-up call to society. The third act, which depicts poor people lining up to buy rice, having their money stolen, and being falsely accused of being thieves and beaten by the police, is the most alarming and moving. On the one hand, the poor are starving to death, and on the other hand, the wife of a rice weevil hears about the rising price of rice and says happily, "It must rise further, it must rise further!" One really doesn't know what her intentions are.</p>
<p>The author's technique is excellent. For example, the aunt's mistreatment of her niece is only highlighted by trivial matters. When the uncle returns home, the niece is busy preparing water for him to wash his face; the aunt outwardly says that she feels sorry for her, but in her heart she hopes that she will be treated like this. Later, when the niece's husband returns home, he also wants to wipe his face, and while the aunt calls the maid, the niece readily rushes to fetch the water. This does not contain a single word, but it vividly portrays the aunt's discriminatory attitude towards her niece.</p>
<p>Shen Min's portrayal of the niece is successful. She is good at playing tragedies and always plays young, ill-fated women. Such as "Little Husband," "Shanghai Nights," "Sea Love," "Professional Women," etc., it can be said that none of them do not belong to this category. Recently, Jin Xing Film Company invited her to play Gu Xiaomei in "Tears Sprinkled on Flowers," who is also a pitiful victim. It is said that Shen Min is quiet, honest, and innocent, so she is most suitable for playing this type of role. Coupled with her serious and earnest attitude towards art, she often pretends to be true and completely forgets herself: when acting in sad scenes, she can't help but cry out from the bottom of her heart, which is also her strength.</p>
<p>Huang Zongjiang's He Jinfang is also extremely natural. The way he listens to the other party speak, with his head held high, complacent and smiling, is very life-like. Others include Su Dan's Zhao Fuquan, whose undershirt peeks out from his silk short shirt, looking like a businessman; You Yun's old woman, whose small feet are famous for walking; Shi Hui's Lin Mengping, worried and proud; Bai Chen's Li Yanyun, lively, humorous, optimistic, and brave; Liu Jin's Zhao Meifen, pitiful and kind: all of them can portray their respective characters, making this play a uniformly developed and well-matched performance.</p>
<p>The Mandarin is also above average, but sometimes it is slightly careless and the tones are wrong. For example, although the "bu" character in "xunbu" (patrolman) is in the rising tone, the pronunciation is often like the departing tone, but it is wrongly pronounced as the rising tone "pu" character. Also, for example, the "qiang" in "mianqiang" (reluctant) should be in the rising tone, but it is wrongly pronounced as the level tone "qiang" in "qiangdao" (robber).</p>

<p>For harmony to continue, the first is to use talent appropriately. Great talents bear great responsibilities, and small talents bear small responsibilities. In a collective, there is no one who is not responsible. The second is to suit temperament.

<p>Chapter Nine Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth?</p>
<p>Xu Jing pointed to the sword on the wall and asked, "I just saw Brother Liu's dart skills. Brother Liu's swordsmanship must be very high. Could the Longquan on the wall be the one used by Brother Liu? Can you grant me a look?" Liu Yinyang nodded, stood up, took the sword off the wall, and handed it to Xu Jing. Xu Jing had already put his own sword aside. He drew out Liu Yinying's sword and saw that the light was like scattered lightning and the quality was like dazzling snow. It was indeed exceptionally sharp, slightly shorter than his own Chifeng sword by two or three inches. The words "White Dragon" were engraved on the hilt. He then praised, "This sword is much better! Brother Liu must use it often." Liu Yinyang smiled and said, "Since I came here a year ago, this sword has been hibernating with me in the mountains and has been of no use. Are you going to laugh at me for betraying the sword? The sword is called White Dragon and was seized from a notorious thief. There is still a page of bloody history in this." Xu Jing said, "If this sword were to fall into the hands of a thief, it would be like casting a pearl in the dark, which would be a pity. Now that it is in Brother Liu's hands, it is truly where it belongs." As he spoke, he returned the White Dragon sword to Liu Yinyang, who took it in his hand and was about to hang it back on the wall. Xu Jing wanted to see Liu Yinying's swordsmanship, so he said to Liu Yinyang, "Brother Liu's swordsmanship must be quite impressive. I would like to see Brother Liu dance." Liu Yinyang did not refuse when he heard this, and said with a smile, "I dare not disobey. But please, Xu, also dance." Xu Jing smiled and said, "My swordsmanship is extremely poor and not worth watching. Please give me some pointers." Liu Yinying smiled and said, "Don't be polite." So the two of them took their swords and walked to the courtyard outside. A crescent moon had already risen in the east, illuminating half of the courtyard like daylight. Liu Yinyang's aunt heard the noise and came out and asked, "Ying'er, why aren't you keeping your guest inside drinking wine, but you're taking your sword to the courtyard to do what?" Liu Yinyang replied, "Aunt, this Mr. Xu can dance with a sword, so I'm dancing with him for fun." Liu Yinyang's aunt smiled and said, "Ying'er is so happy that he wants to dance with a guest. He's really still a child!" She then said to Xu Jing, "Young Master Xu, my nephew is too childish, please don't laugh at him." Xu Jing said, "Brother Liu is innocent and lovely, which makes people respect him the most." Liu Yinying pulled up the front and back of his long robe and said to Xu Jing with a smile, "You are the guest and I am the host, so I should let you dance first." Xu Jing nodded and said, "The good show is in the back, and the inferior skills come first. Let me show off first, and please give me some pointers." (69)</p>
