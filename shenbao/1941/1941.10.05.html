<h3 id="c2">侵略陣綫的悲哀 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>隔昨希特勒發表演說自承「開戰以來的唯一錯誤，厥爲忽略蘇聯早已從事大規模的軍事準備」，這一句話，等於是這位侵略魔王的「罪已詔」，他雖然還大言不慚地自稱對蘇作戰業已大勝，但字裏行間，顯已透出弄巧反拙，作繭自縛的懊喪意味。本來，這次侵蘇軍事，無論從那一方面觀察，都是希特勒自得勢以來空前未有的大失敗，他希望閃電戰成功，事實上却已蛻變爲長期消耗戰，他妄想英美或者默許他的反共十字軍運動，結果却差不多已促成英美蘇三國的同盟，他更希望自蘇聯掠得許多作戰資源、誰想反而耗去偌大兵力，賠掉大量軍實，莫說高加索的油田，依然可望而不可即，就以烏克蘭的糧食而論，也已失之太遲，因爲本年的麥收早爲蘇聯富局捷足先登，德軍想要在烏克蘭方面取給糧食，恐怕至少要等到明年夏天，關於這一層，無怪德國的經濟專家克羅第斯要說：攻蘇後德國自蘇聯取得的物資接濟，尙不及戰前依照雙方經濟協定所可獲得的數量！這眞是得不償失的大大失策。</p>
<p>眞所謂無獨有偶，在西方有一個作繭自縛的希特勒，在東方也有一個弄巧反拙的盟友前者還肯自承「錯誤」，後者則非獨不肯認錯，反要硬着頭皮發出一些自欺欺人的宣傳。例如最近的湘北會戰，明明是因爲低估了中國軍隊的實力和士氣，自己犯了孤軍深入，歸路斷絕的大忌，以致不得小倉皇遁逸，却偏偏還要自稱「轉鋒」、明明已被華軍包圍纔知難而退，壓根兒沒有進入長沙，規偏偏還說「目的完成自動退出」，這種不信不實的宣傳，如果拿來和中國軍事當局不折不扣，十足兌現的忠實報道，互相對照，任何人都不免要爲之啞然失笑。</p>
<p>希特勒在他的演說中，居然還自稱無敵，居然還聲明決不再提和議，這一半是他用以鼓勵士氣，準備應付冬季作戰的門面話，一半也因事實上無論對蘇戰事如何曠日持久，違反預期，他的作戰機構依然凶猛有力，依然足爲蘇聯大患，却是無可吾認的事實。不過爲德國計，今後至少將有三點値得焦慮：第一，冬天一到，蘇聯境內到處積雪，不但機械化部隊無所用之即連空軍也將失其效用，因爲一則氣候酷冷，二則一片白銀，不啻整個大地蒙上一層天然的一僞裝」，轟炸目標勢必極難辨認；第二，英美蘇三國會議業已圓滿結束；今後不獨對蘇援助定將加緊進行，英國也必有選擇目標，儘先反攻的一日，第三，英國海軍封鎖一時旣無鬆弛之望，今冬歐洲大陸的糧食煤斤，必感萬分匱乏，在勝利者加緊壓榨之下，各淪陷區的被壓迫羣衆，勢必鋌而走臉，紛紛起而反抗，近來巴黎的暗殺案，挪威的總罷工風潮，南斯拉夫的游擊戰，以及捷克的騷動，正是納粹統制權漸起動搖的朕兆。準此三端而言，希特勒在今年冬天，顯將因爲他的「唯一錯誤」，而感釗無窮的貽患，說不定也許就一蹶不振。</p>
<p>至於日本，它最近之發動湘北戰事，無疑地，是盼望遵循避重就輕的途徑，迅速取得一個比較煊赫的勝利，藉以解除其內外處境的艱困，其中尤其重要的，是想憑藉此一勝利，增加向美國討價還價的力量，並加重對蘇聯的威脅。可惜現在這種種期望，已因湘北前綫的「自動撒退」而成爲泡影，這在軍事上的打擊固然甚大，但在政治上外交上的後果，似乎更加不利，說小定因此便會影響到日本內閣的前途。反觀中國，一方全國士氣奮發，行見其他各戰區前錢亦將决第發動反攻，一方則因各友邦對於中國實力的增强，早已深信不疑，行見得道多助、國際援助勢必較前愈益踴躍。在這美國軍事使命團和英　財政代表團已在赴渝途中，英美菲三國軍事當局復在馬尼刺舉行重要會議之際，世人對於今後遠東局勢的明朗，顯已具有更大的信心。</p>

<p>今雙馬期貨市况、循例週末祇做半日、而市氣奇昂、又向高峯挺進、蓋邇來廠單飛升之烈、已使一般浮空大爲恐慌、其抵補之下、又加大戶之壟斷、致現貨之脚地挺秀、期紗人心隨之堅定、乃亦爭先吸收、市態愈做愈硬、誠有登峰造極之勢、當晨初開出、十月份爲一八一九〇〇、即升十一元、十一月份爲一八二五·〇〇、亦漲七元、十二月份爲一八六五·〇〇、乃好五元、中途以取引所堅而復疲、乃散多頗有塞出、市價一度下傾、十月份降至一八一四·（〇〇、十一月份低至一八二三·〇〇、十二月份小達一八五二·〇〇、入後徘徊、又見現貨高漲、買方再起拉抬、交易旺盛、市勢立即回上十餘元、其波動之烈、堪稱空前、觀其趨勢之昂、完全爲廠單現貨高升所繫、故從事者、宜做期跟現爲變遷、更宜注意回風之來也、全日上落、結果近期好上二十元、十一月份漲二十三元、十二月份亦好十九一元、週一爲中秋節補假、停市一天、茲將開收盤及最低價列左、</p>

<p>燃料前途　兩重要點</p>
<p>即（一）外滙管理、（二）太平洋戰事爆發之可能性是、關於第一點、直至十月份、平準基金會仍許鴻基公司照官定匯率購買美元、此於鴻基公司等之營業、乃絕對必要者、因水脚煤價與工資、均須以金元付給也、本月份內鴻基公司尙未接獲平準會之外匯供給、鴻基公司之外匯申請、本月份是否已遭拒絕一節、渠當然未便　定、然鴻基公司若不許購售美元、即不能繼續營業、事頗明顯、（按本月購煤結匯平準會已宣布酌准）其次尙須考量遠東局勢、太平洋之和平、將吾破裂、無人知之、而隨時官戰、事亦可能、果爾、本市煤况定將轉劣、不容吾認云、</p>
<p>貯煤計劃　別有所屬</p>

<p>— 趙爾謙</p>
<p>凡是到過靑島的人，莫不知有維昌祿主敎，（Rt．Rev．George　Weig，S．V．D．DD）當船離碼頭尙有三數里的光景，城中建築物首先和我們眼簾相接觸的，就是聳峙山腰高揷雲際玲瓏美麗的天主堂，這是靑島主敎手建的神堂，固然是他終身的結晶品，同時也是他近年來居住休息辦公祈禱的地方。</p>
<p>維氏於一八八三年生於德國，旋入聖言會爲修士，繼在維也納專攻神學和哲學，極有心得，得神學博士學位后，即升爲司鐸。他於一九零八年來華，到山東省傳敎，任兗州府大修道院院長，前后有十二年之久，現在滿佈山東敎區的國籍司鐸，大都出於維氏門牆之下。他主張培養國籍神職班，使得中國的天主敎會完全由中國主持一切，不特適合於中國今日的國情和需要，幷且於天主敎會前途的發展，有莫大的關係。</p>
<p>前羅瑪宗座駐華代表剛恒毅總主敎，以維氏功在敎會和中國，特於一九二八年在兗州府親自祝聖之爲靑島主敎。羅瑪宗座任維氏爲主敎，不但靑島的敎友額手稱慶，幷且深台中國輿情。自茲以還，維主敎永駐靑島，對於全敎區的敎務和敎育竭盡心力，力圖發展，徇至敎友人數和學校數目，均極增加，統計俱在，無庸贅述。近年中日戰事產生，靑島難民數目極大，維主敎視其力之所及，衣之食之，其忙於工作之情况，眞有席不暇煖過門不入之概。昨日（十月三日）靑島來電稱，維主敎近年積勞成疾，臥病多時，醫藥罔效，不幸於三日逝世，滬上友好聞之，深爲震驚，擬於日內舉行追悼。　維氏彌留之際，猶爲中國和靑島敎區的和平祈求，故靑島主敎之逝世，不但是山東敎區之損失，在中國是失一良友。</p>
<h3 id="c70">廢物生產 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 復圭</p>
<p>工藝救濟特訪</p>
<p>三十八年前，在美國波士頓城地方的美以美敎會，發起一種積極性的，逈異於尋常的救濟工作，名爲Goodwilllndustries，即慈善工藝」。我們現在便稱它爲「工藝救濟」。其目的爲給予老弱殘廢失業平民以工作機會。注重職業訓練，自助自給，自力更生。本埠收容難民工作結束後，難民即散處南市等區，無工可作，無衣無食，情形十分悽慘。美僑篷氏Mr．W．D．Boone，目擊心傷，遂引用上述美國辦法，由美國長老會及滬南淸心堂二著名基督敎機關主持，於一九三八年創辦普益工藝社。初創時僅以九百六十三元一角一分的小額經費，每日救濟五六個難民，以後逐年擴大，至去年已達每年用去救濟費用九萬六千元，每日救濟一千餘人，全年直接間接受惠者三萬三千餘人；其事工之進展不可謂不驚人。記者茲將訪問所得，以該社的實際工作報吿讀者。</p>
<p>工藝救濟　的受僱者</p>
<p>該社所辦事工的目的爲提高難民生產技能，改良難民生活現狀，所以稱他們爲難工，不幸者，而不叫他們爲難民，亦不當他們難民看待。凡爲該社僱用者，無論是在訓練或已能工作，一列給予衣食與工資，每日工作七八小時，每小時工資二角至五角，視工作能力及家庭負担而定，該社職業訓練已有三十七種，如木工·漆工·竹工·縫紉，洗染等，視難工之性別，年齡，體格，而分別訓練，分派工作。該社的受僱者可分爲下列各類：（一）體方面殘廢者，（二）苦無機會工作而受刺激之平民，（三）被社會賤視，其本人無法找覓工作者，（四）年老乏人供養者。其中尤以婦女爲多。該社希望難工藝成之時，能晚離該社，出外以技謀生。以是該社又有職業介紹部之設立。出外工作，事實上不可能者，如老弱殘廢之難工，則助其回家做工，而仍與該社保持關係。這樣一來，其餘不幸者，方能源源進社訓練，及於普遍。</p>
<p>無用之物　生命泉源</p>
<p>難工工塲設於南市大東門普益社大厦，工藝救濟的「原料」，大部爲向外界微集所得的舊衣廢物，加以修改，製新，洗染，整理，油漆，然後出賣。出賣與無力購置新衣新物者，所得完全充作難工工資之用。微集廢物辦法，本報已有記載，請同情此種積極性救濟工作的讀者，每家設置一普益袋，隨時將不需用已破舊的衣物提入袋內，通知該社來領取，你如認爲已經是廢棄的東西，正有不少人依賴牠而生活呢。難工的口號是「賜比受者更爲有福，」「利用廢物成爲貧民謀生之出路，」「變廢物爲窮人生產之資源。」難工工塲因限於經費，設施方面，不敷應用，故敬向社會呼籲，他們的需要是，材料方面，如布，紗等，設備方面如縫衣機，機機，毛巾機，印刷機等，如有熱心人士於工藝有心得者，而願担任難工義務指導，更所昐切期望。（未完）</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>中秋節是一年中小朋友們最快樂季節之一，穿的方面，有單夾呢的小西裝，（指有錢人家的孩子）小皮鞋；吃的方面，有蝦，蟹，魚，肉，蓮蓉月餅，蛋黃月餅，火腿月餅，以及良鄕栗子，白菓，雪梨，香蕉，蘋果，藕，芋艿之類。娛樂方面，觀電影，觀平劇等等……，這中秋節，好像是有錢人們獨有的。「月到中秋分外明，」眞是一個　團圓的佳節。然而……許多窮苦的小朋友呢，他們那裏有「中秋節」過？老家是破碎了！爸爸媽媽挈了他們流亡到孤島，天天愁着物價飛漲！度日如年！那裏有什麼「中秋節」呢？享受幸福的小朋友們，趕速觔省月餅，娛樂等浪費，去救救難童吧！現在筆者來談談中秋節的史實和故事。</p>
<p>舊稱陰歷八俄十五日爲，「中秋節」，以其居秋季三月之中也。民國十九年，國民政府，改以陽歷秋分後之望日，最早九月九日，最遲十月七日爲中秋。今年恰是十月五日，適逢小朋友們的星期日。</p>
<p>昔漢西河人，吳剛，學仙有過，謫令伐「月中桂」，桂高五百丈，斫之，樹剏隨台。（見酉陽雜俎。）李時珍曰：「吳剛伐桂之說，起於隋唐小說」。詩人李太白有句：云「欲斫月中桂，持爲寒者薪。」又白居易詩：「偃蹇月中桂。結根依靑天。」</p>
<p>古希臘人，視月桂爲神聖之物，凡詩才優美。或競技得勝者，編桂葉爲花冠授之，以示榮譽。其後歐洲大學中，亦以此贈給學者，英國王室所選拔之詩人，稱曰「桂冠詩人。」</p>
<h3 id="c88">中秋的故事 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>廢歷八俄，　是一個吃月餅的月季。上海和其他都市中的中國人，一年一虔到了中秋，都要吃這美味的月餅。吃月餅挺適當的日子是八月十五日。在中國所有的佳節，都有美味可吃。通常中國人以爲八月十五日是敬月神的日子，所謂中秋，大家都知道。而且有很多故事傳述。有的中國人以爲月是一頭玉兎，所以最初的時候，月餅上面就都印一玉兎、根據佛敎方面的傳說，那麼這兎子是崇信佛敎的，他自願把畢生性命，爲菩薩而犧牲。爲獎勵他的忠誠起見，使他再生，成爲月裏的老人，而這老人就負上月神的一切責任。在八月中秋，古時候一般做母親的女人，每在夜晚時節，用白紙剪成兎子形，放在女兒的鞋子裏面。這樣以爲伊們的女兒，不久就可選得如意郞君而結婚了。</p>
<p>在中國的民歌中，有一神圖畫上，繪有一頭玉兎，坐在月裏一株桂花樹下，正掘取長生不老的藥草。有時更繪一年輕少女，坐在兎子的旁邊哩。</p>
<h3 id="c89">月餅的種類 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 夢白</p>
<p>月餅在古時候，顯然是一種祭月的物品，現在已成人類吃食的東西了。說到月餅的起源，也有一個故事，是有關中國歷史的。據說明朝第一個皇帝朱元璋，起初他在蒙古人的軍隊裏，決心要革命，把元朝推翻。爲便於傳密令起見，就做了一種像月形的餅，面把密令放在餅內。這種餅就在中秋那天分給部下的人，這樣蒙古人就一些不會起疑，這計劃雖失敗的，但月餅就此風行。每年中秋，有吃月餅的風俗。假如這故事是確實的，那麽月餅的創製，遠在元代，去今已五百多年了。月餅的風行買來送給委座的，由冠生園承製。這樣的一個月餅，現在怕要値數千元了。</p>
<h3 id="c90">國王與木棍 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 子壬</p>
<p>在許多年以前，有一個國王，爲了他好亽闖蕩，因而把自己的身子弄得瘦弱而多病，於是，他便請了一位有名的醫生來，替他診治。這位聰明的醫生，由於各方面細細的觀察的結果；知道不是藥劑所能治愈的，然而，這却極需要着運動的幫助。</p>
<p>因此，這位醫生就帶了兩根用木料做成的沉重的棍子來，交給國王，並且對他說，這兩個東西便是治愈他病體的藥劑了。</p>
<p>這醫生吿訴國王，並可囑他必須緊握在這兩個木棍的手柄上，然後把它漸漸地搖動，這樣不定的擺動着，直至他的手裏出汗，才讓它停止。它的功用就是把身體內部的濕氣驅逐出來。國王便依了醫生的話，每天在一定的時候去做這木棍的運動。</p>
<p>國王經過這樣的運動以後，他的筋力便漸漸强起來，健康日見增進，因此，他極贊美這木棍的效能和醫生的聰明，以後，他也不再去請敎醫生了。但這木棍也並沒有什麽東西在裹面，祇不過用木料做成的罷了。最後，他才明白了，這奇異的治療法，不是在乎木棍的本身，而在他自己努力不斷地運動的結果。</p>
<h3 id="c91">賞月 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 曹斌傑作</p>
<p>秘的美女叫嫦娥，說是偷了長生不老的藥草，逃往月球中去這樣伊就長生不老了。這故事已編成戲劇，在舞台上演，而這逃亡的女人，更以一種舞蹈來代表。在，使近年製作的方法，亦日見進步。尤其在上海，月餅商競爭的劇烈，可充分的看得出來，但製造儘管改良，月餅的形狀總是圓的因爲要代表月亮。</p>
<p>在上海，有三種不同樣的月餅。就是廣式，蘇式，和寗式（南京式）。蘇寗兩式，製法相同，但大致寗式大些，比蘇式的饀多。至於蘇式，饀子在考究而不在過多。這兩種月餅，面上每是黃色而烘焦了的，印有各種名稱，而最風行的是廣式月餅，比較硬些，烘得也比較黃些。比蘇寗兩式大，而看去好像外國餅。關於饀子，廣式月餅也各各不同，除了火腿，豆蓉，棷蓉，甜絨肉之外，甚至用蓮子，子雞和鴨蛋等等。通常廣式月餅的售價，也比蘇寗兩式大，上百元一隻的也不稀罕。並通當做送禮用的，大致每隻一二元左右。其特製的，有的大得像桌面一樣，裹面有一隻全鷄，一隻火腿，一打左右鴨蛋。據說戰前，上海所做的月餅，最大的一個，值價五百元，是蔣委員的下屬</p>
<h3 id="c92">中秋夜的月 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>一年一度的廢曆中秋節又在今天降臨了，街道上便可以發貝不少送節禮的，在如此物價高漲的現在，爲什麼不能節省些這種無謂的消耗？阿亮的家裏就絲毫沒有過節的現象。阿亮的母親僅買了一二匣的小月餅，預備今晚在晒台上賞月的時候，分給全家的人，每人可吃一個，這僅是點綴而已。</p>
<p>「媽媽，今晚的月一定是圓圓的，聽說有一個嫦娥是住在月宮裏的，是不是？」阿亮聽得他母親要到賞月的時候，才能吃月餅。便在賞月的兩個字上，發生了這個問題。</p>
<p>「阿亮，這是沒有根據的神話，其實月裏是不會有嫦娥的，要知道月裏的黑影，並不是什麼嫦娥，正和我們的地球上一模一樣，有岩石，有山脈，有平原，這等等東西從我們的地球上瞧來，便看見月裏的黑影，就誤會到別的地方去了。你要知道月裏是非常的寒冷，如果有人能去的話，那一定會凍成一條冰凍的身體。月裏爲什麼會這樣的寒冷呢？月的四周，因爲沒有一些空氣的存在，要是沒有了空氣，便不能保持一定的溫度，月雖也能照到太陽，當太陽照射在月裏的石頭，它受到了太陽熱烈光綫的照射，溫度便升得很高，但是當太陽照射不到的時候，因沒有空氣的緣故，溫度便立即降下來，當時太陽照下來的熱度，一些也保持不牢，所以月亮的黑暗部分的溫度，竟低到零度下五百度，你想這可怕不可怕？我們能不能在這樣低的溫度下過日子？因此月裏不要說一些動植物都沒有，就是連一滴水也尋不到，因爲這種的低溫度，委實太可怕了。」阿亮幼稚的問話，被他父親聽到了，便說了這許多話，來糾正他錯誤的心理。</p>
<p>「爸爸，那麼中秋夜的月，爲什麼一定是圓的，而且光亮得很？」阿亮轉過頭去，還問着他不十分了解的問題。</p>
<p>「中秋節是廢曆的八月十五日，凡逢每一月的十五，月都會圓的，這是什麽道理？月的有時圓有時缺，是由於它受到日光照射面積的不同而發生變化。月是不會發光的『它的所以明亮」完全是反射太陽的光綫，但是太陽能夠照得到的地方，只有一面，反轉的那一面，是不會光亮的了。當我們每逢月半看見月是圓形時，便是我們看見的這一面，完全受到了太陽光綫的緣故。月是時時刻繞着我們的地球轉動。當轉到一個地卞，對我們的這一面，只有一半照到太陽光，其餘的僅僅有一點糊塗而不淸楚的黑影。一到每月的月半，整個的月都可看見了，便覺得格外的明亮了。」阿亮的父親說完這話，已到了吃晚飯的時候了。</p>
<p>今天的晚上，晒台上多了這一批人在賞月，阿亮坐在他父親的旁邊，預備大大的欣賞這中秋的月；况且，他還有月餅吃，眞是好運氣哩。</p>

<p>— 萬千</p>
<p>－一個爲國犧牲的鬥士－</p>
<p>沈醫師，諱詩義，字公持，浙江杭州市人。卒業於浙江醫專，曾任仁濟醫院及兩路局醫師。戰後入後方服務，兩年來往來於鄂北湘西，備嘗辛苦，從無怨言。最近日軍攻長沙，戰事激烈，君馳赴湘陰，主持傷兵病院，不幸積勞成疾，於九月二十五日辰時殉國。享年三十七歲，遺一妻及子女各一。</p>
<p>這幾天，正當全國上下熱烈慶祝長沙大捷的時候，突然接到一個噩耗，我的舊同事沈詩義先生莧在這一役中，把他可貴的生命獻給祖國了。</p>
<p>自從這一次的戰事發生以來，犧牲的烈士很多，我當然不能特別把他捧到三十三天去。不過，因爲沈醫帥的死使我發生了兩個極大的感觸，忍不住要說幾句話：</p>
<p>第一：留在上海的中國人實在太舒服了，太調皮了；沈醫師也是一個聰明人，絕對不是獃子，他也未嘗不能一直留在上海，過他的安樂的生活；然而他終於毅然決然的走進後方去，在距離前綫極近的地帶工作，吹辛吃苦，以致於死！他這個人固然値得我們佩服，而我們至今還在這裏苟延着的却越發覺得無地自容了。</p>
<p>第二：戰後上海市面畸形繁榮，好些大醫師都發了財，坐汽車，造洋房，驕傲得像有錢人家屋子裏養的熱帶魚一樣；請他們看病，還要擺出一副「吃生米飯」面孔，似乎神氣得了不得。後方需要醫療人才非常殷切，可是有那一個肯去呢？在他們遝以爲自己是非常的尊貴，其實比了沈醫師，他們簡直卑怯自得一個大錢也不値！</p>
<p>我原不想駡人，可是有感於好友之死，禁不住要發洩一下，願大家一致勉勵起來！</p>
<p>（編者按）沈醫師是位名票友，他在未赴後方之前，常爲本刋撰述，文筆淸麗，理論透澈，實不可多得之評劇家．今也爲國犧性，敬代本刋致崇高的敬禮！</p>

<p>Chongqing, a Central News Agency dispatch from Changsha today states that the Japanese troops attacking in Hunan have been defeated north of the Miluo River, abandoning a large number of corpses, ammunition, and supplies. The dispatch also states that the Chinese army has captured Japanese positions along the Xinqiang River north of the Miluo River. Countless wounded and sick Japanese soldiers have been captured. The retreating Japanese troops are being pursued by the Chinese army along the Xinqiang River. Many wounded Japanese soldiers have been captured in the areas of Fulinpu and Jinjing. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing, a Chinese dispatch from northern Hunan continues to describe the heavy losses of the retreating Japanese troops. It is reported that the Chinese army now occupies all the ferries on the Xinqiang River, preparing to intercept the Japanese troops retreating north across the Miluo River towards Yuezhou. A large number of Japanese remnants left on the south bank of the Miluo River are being rapidly cleared out. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing, according to Chinese military news, the Chinese army's sweep in northern Hunan is progressing like a hot knife through butter. Yesterday, all strongholds on the south bank of the Miluo River were recovered. The main force of the Japanese army retreated north across the Miluo River and was fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army. The river water turned red. A small number who failed to retreat were disarmed and captured. According to a front-line victory report this morning, most of the Japanese troops retreated to the north bank of the Miluo River, and after their initial shock, they were intercepted by Chinese field armies scattered in the Xinqiang River area, launching an encirclement battle. Although Japanese aircraft flew to the front yesterday to try to cover their breakout, most of them were still trapped in a desperate situation. The authorities here have highly praised Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue, who is directing the battle in northern Hunan. It is reported that Chairman Chiang has issued a commendation order to Xue and the generals at the front. (4th, Source Omitted)</p>
<p>London, according to an official telegram from Chongqing, the commanders of the Fourth and Second Divisions of the Japanese army engaged in the major offensive in Changsha have been killed in battle. One of them was Major General Toyota, who committed suicide by seppuku after being wounded. The other major general was killed by the Chinese forces. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing, (1) The Chinese armies in northern Hunan are fiercely pursuing and intercepting the Japanese troops who broke through and retreated north. A large number of gains were made on the 3rd, and the pursuit and interception are continuing. (2) The Chinese army is fiercely pursuing the Japanese troops who broke through and retreated north. The scattered small groups of Japanese troops in the area south of the Miluo River who failed to retreat have been surrounded by the Chinese army and will soon be completely wiped out. (3) The Chinese units intercepting the Japanese troops who broke through and retreated north have successively made gains in the areas near Lukou She Fuxing, Sanjie Bridge, Yejing, and Mafengzui. The Japanese troops who have lost their combat power immediately abandoned their horses, baggage, and heavy belongings as soon as they encountered the Chinese army, and retreated north in a chaotic manner. (3rd)</p>
<p>Changsha, the Japanese troops who invaded the northwest of Liuyang at the end of last month were counterattacked by a certain Chinese unit and suffered heavy losses. On the 1st, they collapsed and retreated north through Yongan City. At Lukou, they were intercepted by Chinese pursuit troops. After a fierce battle until dusk, they turned back to Daqiao City Yongcha Street and retreated towards Jinjing. On the morning of the 3rd, they were again pursued by another Chinese unit and are now being surrounded and attacked. (3rd)</p>
<p>Nationwide Congratulations and Condolences</p>
<p>(Changsha) The Guangdong Provincial Party, Government, and Military circles sent a telegram to Xue Yue to congratulate him on the victory, and plan to use 300,000 yuan to prepare condolence items to be distributed to the officers and soldiers who contributed to the effort. (3rd)</p>
<p>Shaoguan, the various circles in Guangdong are organizing a comfort delegation to the front lines in Hunan and Guangdong, and preparations are being intensified. The headquarters of a certain war zone has decided to send one major general and one brigadier general, and the provincial government will send one member. The two members will jointly preside over the delegation. Representatives from the provincial party headquarters, the provincial assembly, the reporters' association, and the chamber of commerce will participate. The delegation will depart within days. In addition to the funds for the comfort mission being allocated and borne by various agencies, a free donation drive is also being launched. A certain merchant has launched a mooncake comfort campaign, and all large and small stores are actively responding, demonstrating the merchants' patriotic enthusiasm. In addition, the comfort preparatory committee has created a 10,000-signature congratulatory telegram. A cloth several dozen feet long was hung in the main streets of Shaoguan this afternoon for the public to sign their names. From noon to dusk, crowds of people went to sign their names, creating a particularly grand scene. (3rd)</p>
<p>Guilin, the joint association of Guilin newspapers and the press association sent a telegram to Commander Xue in Changsha on the 3rd to congratulate him on the victory. (3rd)</p>
<p>Leiyang, Changsha has achieved another victory, and the whole country is rejoicing. Various circles in Hunan have organized a comfort delegation to comfort the officers and soldiers of this battle. Representatives from the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, and the provincial assembly will serve as the head and deputy head of the delegation. Members include the Youth League, the military district, the Provincial Mobilization Committee, the Women's Committee, the Provincial Relief Association, the Provincial Health Department, and the Central News Agency. The delegation is scheduled to depart for the front line before the Double Tenth Festival. (Source illegible) Chongqing, Chairman Chiang recently received a telegram from overseas Chinese in New York, reiterating their sincerity in support and donating 400,000 yuan in legal tender for the comfort of the officers and soldiers. The funds have been allocated by the National Comfort General Association and other agencies as a fund for the production activities of honorary servicemen, and it has been decided to establish honorary servicemen's production cooperatives in Luzhou and Guang'an. In addition, the comfort delegation organized by the association this summer has been delayed in departing. Now, due to the great victory in Hubei, there is news of their departure. The head of the delegation, Ju Zheng, may personally lead the delegation to Hunan. (Source illegible) Chongqing, after the great victory in northern Hunan, the various circles in the wartime capital continued to send telegrams to Commander Xue and the officers and soldiers at the front to congratulate them. These include Minister Zhu Jiahua, Minister Chen Lifu, the National Spiritual Mobilization Association, the Central Cultural Movement Committee, the Anti-Aggression Branch, the League of Nations Comrades Association, the National Diplomacy Association, and the Chinese-British, Chinese-American, Chinese-French-Belgian-Swiss, and Chinese-Burmese cultural associations, the Chinese News Association, the Central Industrial and Commercial Movement Committee, the Chinese Labor Association, and the Wartime Public Bonds Solicitation Committee. (Source illegible) The Political Committee of a certain war zone and the joint organization of the party and government branches have organized a battlefield service group to cooperate with the military victory and depart for various townships surrounding Changsha to restore social order and focus on comforting the officers and soldiers and rescuing refugees. (3rd) Singapore, the Chinese and foreign newspapers here have prominently published the news of the great victory in northern Hunan. (Source illegible) The public in Chengdu rejoiced enthusiastically after the news of the great victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan reached here. On the night of the 2nd, the sound of firecrackers shook the entire city and continued all night. Governor Zhang of the provincial government, in order to encourage morale, specially allocated 50,000 yuan from the provincial government yesterday to be remitted to the front to comfort the officers and soldiers on the entire front participating in the battle. He also telegraphed Commander Xue and all members. (Source illegible) Lu Dangping and three to five other people from Henan and Hunan in Luoyang sent a telegram to Chairman Xue Yue of Hunan to congratulate him on the great victory in northern Hunan. (Source illegible) Xiong Yingxian, a female reporter from the Hengyang Lihua Daily, believed that the officers and soldiers of a certain army had made great contributions in the great victory in northern Hunan, and specially donated a pair of gold bracelets, weighing one tael, from her savings to comfort the wounded officers and soldiers, and personally went to various hospitals in Hengyang to express her condolences. (4th) Foreigners who once underestimated Japanese power have now realized their past mistakes. The "Evening News" mocked the various propaganda claims made by the Japanese regarding the battle in northern Hunan, and stated that Changsha's strategic position is extremely important. If the Japanese army is driven back to its original positions, then Japan and the Japanese army will fundamentally lose their value. The Japanese have made such propaganda every time they fail, and it has not been just once. The Japanese army's attack this time was indeed a full-fledged effort. The Chinese army, on the one hand, can cope with the Japanese offensive, and on the other hand, it can advance and implement a counteroffensive. This shows that American aid has begun to take effect. The result of this battle proves that democratic countries should step up their aid to China. (3rd)</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Southeastern Zhengzhou</p>
<p>Chongqing military news, (1) The Japanese troops advancing on Zhengzhou are being continuously reinforced. As of noon on the 3rd, the reinforcements totaled more than 20,000. The Chinese army is fiercely resisting the attacking Japanese troops in front, fighting in bloody battles. Both sides have suffered casualties. Bloody battles are continuing on all fronts. (2) The Japanese troops who forcibly crossed the flooded (New Yellow River) southeast of Zhongmu to Jiemai continued to increase to more than 13,000 on the morning of the 3rd, with more than 1,000 cavalry and 40 to 50 tanks, and continued to advance on Zhengzhou.

<h3 id="e2">The Tragedy of the Aggression Front <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hitler gave a speech in which he admitted that "the only mistake since the start of the war was neglecting the Soviet Union's large-scale military preparations." This statement is equivalent to the "edict of self-reproach" of this invasion demon. Although he still shamelessly claimed that the war against the Soviet Union had been a great victory, between the lines, he clearly revealed a sense of frustration and self-inflicted wounds. Originally, this invasion of the Soviet Union, from any point of view, was Hitler's unprecedented major failure since he gained power. He hoped that the blitzkrieg would succeed, but in fact it has transformed into a long-term war of attrition. He妄想英美或者默許他的反共十字軍運動, 結果却差不多已促成英美蘇三國的同盟，He妄想英美或者默許他的反共十字軍運動, 結果却差不多已促成英美蘇三國的同盟，He妄想英美或者默許他的反共十字軍運動, 結果却差不多已促成英美蘇三國的同盟，He更希望自蘇聯掠得許多作戰資源、誰想反而耗去偌大兵力，賠掉大量軍實，莫說高加索的油田，依然可望而不可即，就以烏克蘭的糧食而論，也已失之太遲，因爲本年的麥收早爲蘇聯富局捷足先登，德軍想要在烏克蘭方面取給糧食，恐怕至少要等到明年夏天，關於這一層，無怪德國的經濟專家克羅第斯要說：攻蘇後德國自蘇聯取得的物資接濟，尙不及戰前依照雙方經濟協定所可獲得的數量！這眞是得不償失的大大失策。</p>
<p>It is truly said that misfortunes never come singly. In the West, there is a Hitler who spun a cocoon around himself, and in the East, there is an ally who messed things up. The former is still willing to admit "mistakes," while the latter not only refuses to admit mistakes, but insists on putting on a brave face and issuing some self-deceptive propaganda. For example, the recent battle in northern Hunan was clearly because they underestimated the strength and morale of the Chinese army and committed the major taboo of penetrating deep into enemy territory and cutting off their retreat route, resulting in their hasty escape. However, they insisted on calling it a "change of front." It was clear that they were surrounded by the Chinese army before realizing the difficulty and retreating, and they never even entered Changsha. However, they insisted on saying that they "automatically withdrew after completing their objective." If this incredible and untruthful propaganda is compared with the Chinese military authorities' truthful reports, which are completely and fully redeemed, anyone cannot help but smile wryly.</p>
<p>In his speech, Hitler actually claimed to be invincible and declared that he would never propose peace again. This is partly a facade he used to boost morale and prepare for winter warfare, and partly because, in fact, no matter how protracted the war against the Soviet Union is and how much it deviates from expectations, his war machine is still ferocious and powerful, and still a major threat to the Soviet Union. This is an undeniable fact. However, for Germany, there will be at least three points worth worrying about in the future: First, when winter arrives, snow will accumulate everywhere in the Soviet Union. Not only will mechanized units be useless, but even the air force will lose its effectiveness, because on the one hand, the climate is extremely cold, and on the other hand, a piece of white silver is no different from the entire earth being covered with a layer of natural camouflage. Bombing targets will inevitably be extremely difficult to identify; Second, the meeting of the three countries, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, has concluded satisfactorily. In the future, not only will aid to the Soviet Union be stepped up, but Britain will also have a day to select targets and launch a counterattack as soon as possible; Third, with no hope of easing the British naval blockade for a while, the European continent will feel a great shortage of food and coal this winter. Under the intensified oppression of the victors, the oppressed masses in the occupied areas will inevitably take the risk and rise up to resist. The recent assassinations in Paris, the general strike in Norway, the guerrilla warfare in Yugoslavia, and the unrest in Czechoslovakia are all signs that the Nazi regime is gradually shaking. Based on these three points, Hitler will clearly suffer endless harm this winter because of his "only mistake" and may even fall into a slump.</p>
<p>As for Japan, its recent launch of the battle in northern Hunan was undoubtedly hoping to follow the path of avoiding the heavy and attacking the light, and quickly achieve a relatively glorious victory, so as to relieve its internal and external difficulties. Among them, what is particularly important is to try to use this victory to increase its bargaining power with the United States and increase its threat to the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, now these expectations have become a bubble due to the "automatic withdrawal" from the front line in northern Hunan. The military blow is certainly great, but the political and diplomatic consequences seem to be even more unfavorable. It is said that it may affect the future of the Japanese cabinet. Looking back at China, on the one hand, the morale of the whole country is high, and we will see that the front lines in other war zones will also launch a counteroffensive. On the other hand, because friendly countries have long been deeply convinced of the increase in China's strength, we will see that those who gain the Dao will have more help, and international aid will inevitably be more enthusiastic than before. At a time when the US military mission and the British financial delegation are on their way to Chongqing, and the military authorities of the US, Britain, and the Philippines are holding an important meeting in Manila, the world has a clearer confidence in the future of the Far East situation.</p>

<p>Chongqing, the bond-raising campaign in Hong Kong is about to end with satisfactory results, which will be officially announced soon. The greatest characteristic of this Hong Kong bond-raising campaign is the universality of the mobilization and the depth of the publicity. People from all walks of life enthusiastically participated, which is rarely seen in previous patriotic movements. Among them, Mr. Liang Dequan, a businessman, originally served as a volunteer in the Hong Kong Zhongshan Charity Society and other important clan associations. He was particularly enthusiastic about this Hong Kong bond-raising campaign, working day and night in the fifth team of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce's bond-raising campaign, regardless of wind or rain, running around and using his eloquent tongue to encourage and inspire people. Everyone who listened generously donated. Unfortunately, due to overwork, he was unaware of his accumulated illnesses. He suddenly fell ill, but because of the blackout, he could not find a doctor for treatment and passed away. This is the first person to sacrifice since the public bond-raising campaign. Wu Hanzhen, a special commissioner of the Bond-Raising Association, wrote an article to mourn him. It is heard that the association will also commend him. (4th)</p>

<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th – The diplomatic monthly "Gaiko Jiho," which often reflects the views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said today, "If the United States truly upholds justice and humanity, it should immediately end the European war.  In this vast world, only the United States can undertake this task, and it is not too late now.  But it is most regrettable that the United States shows signs of abandoning this honor, because the U.S. participation in the war will expand the war to all parts of the world and will increase human suffering.  The Axis powers are working to create a 'new order' in Europe and East Asia in order to eliminate unreasonable and unnatural factors that disrupt peace. The United States should strictly adhere to neutrality and hope for the realization of the 'new order,' because the 'new order' not only does not threaten the United States, but will also benefit the United States.  The United States should recognize the fait accompli in East Asia, restore its natural commercial relations with Japan, and stop helping Japan's enemies."</p>

<p>Reuters, Hanoi, 4th – Although the situation here is superficially peaceful, it is actually still fraught with unease. General attention is now focused on the imminent arrival of Fonzawa. It is said that Fonzawa is bringing a large number of consular officials with him. The Japanese military mission, previously led by Cheng Tian, has now been mostly disbanded, and the remaining personnel will be incorporated under Fonzawa. People here are watching the arrival of Fonzawa with attention and hope that this will facilitate the resolution of some difficulties. Governor Decoux of Vietnam's recent remarks about the Japanese side not fully fulfilling the conditions of the economic agreement can indicate the French authorities' full understanding of the various difficulties experienced by Vietnamese import merchants. Recently, five major import merchants have cancelled contracts signed with Japanese merchants because the delivery of orders has been repeatedly delayed, and the original prices of several transactions have been increased four times. Japanese cargo ships come empty and leave full of Vietnamese goods. Japanese trading companies here are now making various efforts to concentrate business in their hands, intending to first import various goods themselves and then deliver them to local customers. Neutral observers here all regard Fonzawa's actions as the first sign of Japan's attempt at long-term occupation. The rumors of British, American, and Japanese negotiations have aroused attention and speculation here, but no detailed information is available in Vietnam, as in any other place.</p>

The communiqué stated that a Soviet unit under Colonel Ponomarev, operating on the southwest front, killed 9,500 German officers and soldiers, destroyed 7 enemy artillery batteries, 35 anti-tank guns, 45 machine guns, 22 grenade launchers, and 60 trucks in September, and captured a large number of war trophies, including 4 heavy artillery batteries, 52 anti-tank guns, 57 light and heavy machine guns, 12 grenade launchers, 28 flamethrowers, 180 trucks, 200 horses, and a large amount of ammunition.

<p>Hitler Appeals to the German People to Fight the Soviet Union at All Costs</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 4th – Yesterday, Führer Hitler declared to Germany that the Soviet army had been largely destroyed by Germany, and warned the German people that they should make new sacrifices to win the war. He also reiterated his supreme confidence and declared, "With the military equipment we are providing, we can overcome all obstacles. The military equipment we are using in this year's operations will be the equipment we use in next year's operations." Hitler said that the war against the Soviet Union, which broke out on June 22, has global significance. "The future world will regard this day as a new page in history."</p>
<p>German Progress Slows Down, Proving That Morale Is Declining</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – A Reuters military commentator said that the best critique of the progress of the war can be seen in the gradually slowing rate of German advance. In the first two months, the German advance averaged ten kilometers per day, then gradually decreased to an average of one or two kilometers per day. In the past few days, there has been almost no progress. Furthermore, the Soviet positions in Leningrad seem to have stabilized. The Soviet army counterattacks as the German army advances. The Soviet side not only defends the vast front lines around the city, but also maintains smooth traffic lines to the city. In short, the war has almost reached a state of trench warfare. The German transportation lines are long and dangerous, and their reserve troops and supply bases are threatened by the closer proximity of the Soviet army. The Soviet side has gradually become accustomed to German tactics and has been able to find ways to achieve decisive results, which must have made their soldiers and commanders feel discouraged. The fighting was still fierce along the entire front yesterday, but the Soviet army won important local victories near Leningrad and Ukraine. The German army may fight to the death in order to capture Kharkov in a few days. If the German side is prepared to pay a heavy price, it may succeed, but the German side's manpower and material resources, although said to be huge, are now gradually running out and are very close to the limit of sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Germany Implements High-Pressure Policies Against People in Occupied Countries; 14 More Czechs Executed; People Also Arrested in Poland, France, Hungary, Etc.; Czech Cabinet Members Call on the World to Pay Attention to German Atrocities <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – According to the latest news received in London, the flames of German terror in the occupied countries have not abated. In addition to the Prague Radio announcement that 14 more Czechs have been sentenced to death by military courts in Prague and Brno, it is reported that Polish people are also being executed daily. Swiss Radio Broadcasting also reported that more people in France have been arrested. The most recent was the arrest of 62 people in a working-class district of Paris for possessing knives and leaflets. Also, a 19-year-old girl, Miss Stankov, from Hungary, was sentenced to death by a military court in Szeged, Hungary, for sabotaging a German store in Ugopotek on September 19. Another girl, Miss Gaising, was charged with the same crime and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Both girls have pleaded guilty and said that the "explosives" were provided by Miss Stankov's brother. The German side still charged the recently executed Czechs with "treason, economic sabotage, and illegal possession of weapons, etc." Of the 14 Czechs executed yesterday, 8 were shot and the remaining 6 were hanged. Another 130 Czechs were handed over to the secret police. In the past three months, the number of Poles executed and shot, as reported in a small number of German newspapers in Poland, was 150, including 12 women, the rest being men. This is based on information collected from German newspapers. The number of those directly killed by the secret police without any legal justification, and those who died from torture in concentration camps, is even more unknown. It is reported that in a certain famous concentration camp built by the German side, at least 40 people die every day.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – The Czech cabinet broadcast a message to the Czech people yesterday afternoon, stating that the Czech government faithfully conveys the feelings of the people and declares that all true Czechs will swear on the graves of the brutally murdered soldiers, workers, technicians, farmers, and intellectuals to avenge them and to persist in the struggle against German oppression until final victory is achieved. The Czech government asks the civilized world to pay attention to the fact that Hitler's executioners have put to death some Czechs who were detained in German prisons and concentration camps many months ago and could not participate in recent movements. The German massacre of innocent Czechs held as hostages is a heinous crime. Clean people all over the world will take it as their sacred duty to never forget this German spiritual shame. The Czech government, because of the martyrdom and resistance of its people, believes that it not only has the responsibility but also the right to ask the world to remember that without Czech freedom, there is no freedom in Europe, and that the establishment of a new order of peace must be based on law and strict fairness towards Germany. The article did not instruct Czechs abroad not to participate in all public gatherings that have no direct connection with their work, in order to express their grief.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Beijing, 4th – The German Commander-in-Chief stationed in Belgium and Northern France, in view of the fact that Belgian and French youths are trying to leave the country illegally to join the enemy, has taken appropriate precautionary measures. According to the recently promulgated order, anyone who privately joins the enemy army fighting against Germany will be sentenced to death. Those with special circumstances will be sentenced to imprisonment. The same applies to those who help others commit this crime. The German Commander-in-Chief pointed out that these youths are all seduced by foreign spies and do not understand the nature of their actions. However, since Germany has already released the surrendered troops and prisoners of war from Belgium, it also trusts the loyalty of the Belgian people, so it cannot tolerate this movement of Belgian youths.</p>
<p>Germany Claims that Mr. Ilyess Committed Espionage</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Prague, 4th – Witness Richter testified in the People's Court yesterday that Prime Minister Ilyess was a secret leader of some kind similar to May Asia. He knew quite well about the secret military organizations established by General Engel and General Neumann in the Protectorate. General Engel was in charge of arranging for Czechs to cross the border. Neumann was responsible for assassinating Czechs who compromised with Germany. The families of those who joined the Benes government and fled overseas were also supported by some illegal organization. Mr. Ilyess was even related to a certain espionage agency, whose leader was the Prime Minister's Director of Intelligence, Mr. Allen. Richter testified under detailed questioning that Yap originally approved of cooperating with Germany, but was induced by Mr. Ilyess to join his organization.</p>
<p>Germany Also Arrests Many People in Norway</p>
<p>International News Service, Stockholm, 4th – It is reported that many more people have been arrested in Norway, and the upper classes have also been suppressed. Some prominent shipowners and other business figures have been detained by the German police for failing to cooperate with the German side. A dispatch from Oslo stated that the concentration camps holding workers and members of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions are overcrowded. These workers were arrested en masse during the recent repeated strikes.</p>

<h3 id="e22">American Representative Ordered to Discuss Religious Freedom with the Soviet Union; Advocate for Drawing Closer to the Vatican to Leverage Religious Influence Against the Axis Powers <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th—President Roosevelt disclosed while hosting news reporters yesterday that he had instructed American representative Harriman to raise the issue of religious freedom within the Soviet Union. The President also stated that this matter had been previously mentioned to the Soviet government, implying that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt had handled the matter. The President further stated that he had not yet received Harriman's report and could not say whether this decision would be successful. As for the question of religious freedom being raised before the Pope, the President was unwilling to comment before his personal envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, returned to the United States.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 4th—A well-informed individual close to President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the diplomatic situation seemed to be leaning towards uniting Catholics worldwide to resist the Nazis. This person said that President Roosevelt greatly hoped that the Vatican and Moscow could reach a rapprochement, allowing their diplomatic representatives to exchange opinions and create a broad force to resist the Axis. However, neither the White House nor the State Department confirmed this news, although concrete evidence exists to support this interpretation. This is the joint statement released by the White House yesterday, which, in light of the Polish ambassador's report, expressed the hope that steps could be taken to achieve complete religious freedom. Furthermore, some Catholics have hinted that if President Roosevelt could persuade Stalin to create a satisfactory environment for religion in communist countries, the Vatican would resolve to oppose the Axis. This individual close to President Roosevelt, well-versed in the religious issue within the Soviet Union and its impact on global diplomacy, told an Associated Press reporter that the United States is planning to make the Soviet Union an ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, and various South American republics, with the Catholic issue being a key condition of this plan. It is heard that the United States has made considerable progress in this diplomatic strategy, but the individual did not guarantee the success of this diplomatic plan. Experts familiar with the debate over religious freedom within the Soviet Union believe that US envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, must have mentioned the possibility of a rapprochement between the Vatican and the Soviet Union during his negotiations with the Vatican. President Roosevelt's comments yesterday regarding religious freedom in the Soviet Union have attracted considerable attention. Observers believe that the White House has made a firm decision on this issue, and although current diplomatic actions do not yet show signs of encircling Germany with religion, it is generally expected that this issue will develop further in the future.</p>
<p>Associated Press, London, 4th—Reliable sources announced today that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps recently raised the issue of Soviet tolerance of religion during talks with Soviet leaders. It is understood that he pointed out the benefits the British government believes the Soviet Union could gain by ceasing anti-God propaganda. These well-informed sources strongly asserted that greater Soviet tolerance of religion would greatly enhance the standing of the Soviet Union and the Allied nations in the United States and other important Catholic countries such as Spain and South American nations.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Amendment to American Neutrality Act to be Decided Next Week; Armed Merchant Ships Being Prepared <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th—President Roosevelt told the press yesterday that the government intends to find a way to amend the Neutrality Act. A final decision cannot be made until the Senate leaders hold a bipartisan meeting next Tuesday. Regarding the issue of arming American merchant ships, which is prohibited by the Neutrality Act, he believes that the law is very clear on this point. He cannot force Congress to enact a practical policy, nor does he intend to modify the current boundaries of the war zone. However, he feels that the meeting on Tuesday should resolve the Neutrality Act issue.</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 4th—Rear Admiral Blandy, Chairman of the Naval Ordnance Bureau, told a graduating class of US Naval Reserve officers last night that the United States is preparing to arm its merchant fleet. He urged the nation to increase production to fulfill America's promise, as America has described itself as the "arsenal of democracy," and stated, "Every moment of idleness is tantamount to seeking our own death." He said, "Even if Germany enslaves all the nations of Europe, Hitler will not be satisfied and cease his aggression. He himself has repeatedly stated that 'democracy and totalitarianism cannot coexist in the same world.'"</p>
<h3 id="e24">British-German Prisoner Exchange Postponed <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th—The War Office announced that the exchange of British and German wounded and sick prisoners of war, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed. Reuters learned from responsible sources that this postponement is expected to be temporary. The War Office stated that some of the German prisoners of war to be repatriated were originally scheduled to board two hospital ships tonight (Friday) and, according to arrangements agreed upon with the German government, sail across the English Channel to a port in France, and from there, embark wounded and sick British soldiers. However, due to a message received from Berlin, it was deemed necessary to postpone the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war originally scheduled to begin on Saturday. The British government is currently communicating with the German government and hopes to issue a statement within 24 hours. In the meantime, the German prisoners remain on board the ships. When the War Office issued the announcement, the German prisoners had all boarded the ships, and both sides had agreed to a truce from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset to facilitate the transport of the prisoners. The first batch of German prisoners boarded the hospital ships last night at a port with dimmed lights. The two hospital ships, the "Dinaht" and the "St. Julien," formerly used for channel crossings, are now painted white with yellow funnels and masts. The sides of the ships are painted with blue and red crosses, and red cross flags are flown from the mastheads and bows and sterns. Last night, the lights on both ships were brightly lit, and nurses in Red Cross uniforms were seen attending to the German prisoners boarding the ships. Ninety-seven wounded German prisoners boarded one of the ships, including a German army officer, possibly captured in Libya. The rest wore German navy and air force uniforms, with many others in civilian clothes, mostly merchant seamen, and some submarine personnel. Most carried luggage, either suitcases or cloth bags. The last to board were wounded soldiers carried on stretchers, with stretcher-bearers wearing Red Cross armbands. Some of these wounded soldiers had lost the use of both legs, some had lost their right leg, and others walked slowly with crutches. Only two were still defiant; they were both aviators and shouted "Heil Hitler!" as they disembarked. It is reported that the "St. Julien" did not carry German soldiers and would cross the channel empty. Just as the two ships were preparing to set sail, an order was received to postpone the departure. The lights were immediately extinguished, and armed guards were stationed on board for protection.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn: Short Selling Has Largely Concluded; The Cotton Yarn Market's Typhoon is Gradually Shifting; Originally, Speculation Looked to the Wind, But Now the Wind Has Passed</p>
<p>Recently, the cotton yarn market has suddenly become a center of speculation. Although the Nanyang Exchange's activity was cited as a pretext, when that group initially launched their actions, short sellers were dumping shares daily, creating immense pressure. Having endured for a long time, and recognizing that the environment did not permit further action, they painfully covered their positions, resulting in a surge of seventy to eighty yuan in a single day yesterday. Most short positions have been closed, and the situation has drastically changed. There is no longer a so-called short squeeze, and therefore no longer a prevailing wind. In all speculative markets, once the wind has passed, the situation can change dramatically. Furthermore, the long positions have already made significant profits and are frequently releasing their holdings in large quantities. Therefore, some say that the long and short positions are like playing eight rounds of mahjong; the winner has already been decided. Now it is time to switch positions and start a new hand. Let's see which side falters. As for the Hong Kong market's needs, seeing that the cotton yarn market is too high, they have already given up. The telegram from Nanyang regarding the price limit of 1,900 yuan for 20-count Shuangma yarn has not yet been retransmitted. Perhaps because they have already purchased a large amount, they are taking a temporary break. As a result, those who made money have lost their basis, and they are letting go of Shuangma factory orders. The news from Xiangbei's victory and falling yarn prices in Sichuan has further discouraged the long positions. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,944 yuan, the low price was 1,915 yuan, and the closing price was 1,932 yuan. The market is closed this afternoon as usual for the weekend, and there will be a holiday on Monday for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Currently, the cotton yarn market has surged by 132 yuan this week, and a reaction is not to be ignored. 180 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, and short sellers posted two yuan due to yesterday afternoon's decline. Later, the long positions released, and it was leveled off. Therefore, the momentum was relatively stable. The opening price was 1,915 yuan. As soon as this price was set, everyone on the floor started selling, saying to open low and buy high. In an instant, it rose to 1,941 yuan. Then, as the exchange opened slightly better, confidence was restored, and buying pressure remained strong. However, large accounts released massive quantities, and it fell back to 1,925 yuan. However, as soon as the price loosened, buyers swarmed in and it rose again to 1,944 yuan. But the supply on the floor remained strong, and it loosened again to 1,932 yuan at the close. The trading volume in the half-day was 15,020 bales. Except for 20 bales purchased by the Hong Kong market, the rest were all transactions within the industry.</p>
<p>Today's Shuangma futures market followed the usual weekend practice of operating for only half a day, but the market sentiment was surprisingly high, advancing towards a new peak. The recent sharp rise in factory orders has greatly alarmed the short sellers. Their covering, coupled with the manipulation of large accounts, has led to the strong performance of spot goods. The futures market sentiment has also become firm, and everyone is scrambling to buy, making the market increasingly bullish. The situation seems to be reaching its climax. When it initially opened this morning, the October contract was at 1,819.00, up 11 yuan. The November contract was at 1,825.00, also up 7 yuan. The December contract was at 1,865.00, up 5 yuan. In the middle of the day, as the exchange was firm but then weakened, some long positions were released, and the market price declined temporarily. The October contract fell to 1,814.00, the November contract fell to 1,823.00, and the December contract fell slightly to 1,852.00. Afterwards, as spot goods were seen to be rising again, buyers resumed their upward push, and trading became active. The market immediately recovered by more than ten yuan. The volatility was unprecedented. The upward trend is entirely tied to the high prices of factory orders and spot goods. Therefore, those involved should make changes in line with spot goods and pay attention to the coming backdraft. The full-day fluctuation resulted in an increase of 20 yuan for the near-term contract, 23 yuan for the November contract, and 19 yuan for the December contract. Monday is a holiday in lieu of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the market will be closed for one day. The opening, closing, and lowest prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Manufacturers Are Unwilling to Miss the Opportunity to Purchase Cotton</p>
<p>Still Purchasing Within the Possible Range</p>
<p>Although the spot cotton situation is firm, it is still characterized by high prices for coarse cotton and weak prices for fine cotton. This is because those hoarding cotton are unwilling to release their holdings, thinking only of a positive outlook. Therefore, the market sentiment remains firm. Shipments from Hong Kong have not stopped, and Indian cotton occasionally arrives in Shanghai. As for the factories, they generally have three months' worth of inventory. Regarding the application for foreign exchange, there may be a solution for industrial products. It is difficult to predict the future changes.</p>
<p>American cotton, Peng Jia Po, 100 bales, declared at 2635.0</p>
<p>Brazilian, 700 bales, also 735.0</p>
<p>Also, 200 bales, domestic and foreign, declared at 80.0</p>
<p>(November Silver)</p>
<p>Du Li La, 100 bales, dealer's purchase price 500.0</p>
<p>Changyinsha packing, 100 bales, also 450.0</p>
<p>Rangoon, 100 bales, also 470.0</p>
<p>Also, 100 bales, also 465.0</p>
<p>Another report: The Shanghai foreign cotton market is active, and sentiment is enthusiastic. Although some factories are quite interested in purchasing spot cotton, they are hesitant to directly order foreign cotton. At the same time, most of the industry is still unable to purchase due to the lack of a proper solution for foreign exchange settlement. However, considering that the sales price of orders is quite low, and that significant profits will be made upon arrival in Shanghai, it is a rare and excellent opportunity. Therefore, in recent days, those factories that can obtain US dollars as much as possible within the possible range have been enthusiastically ordering foreign cotton that will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to the Southern group selling and floating long positions. However, it later rebounded slightly due to some industry buying and short covering. Yesterday's closing price was down two to three pounds compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculators buying and Calcutta textile industry buying. However, it later fell again due to spot merchants selling and cotton merchants short selling. As a result, yesterday's closing prices all fell by five to six rupees.</p>

<p>Grains: 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Newly Arrived; Rice Prices Initially Small, Then Large</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice prices started low and ended high, and the market presented a fluctuating situation again. However, more than two rice boats arrived, and the 58,000 bags of government-sold rice from public warehouses have been released in batches. It is also rumored that the next batch can be agreed upon soon and released at a fair price. Therefore, the market opened in the morning with a unanimous downward trend, and many floating accounts were eager to close their positions. The opening prices of all types of rice saw a decline. Xiaojiao spot rice once fell to 117 yuan, and even the Yinhua Company's Xiaojiao fell from 145.78 yuan to 145 yuan. The spot price was 140 yuan, down one to two yuan from the previous day. Then, customer囤 (a unit of rice measurement) took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and because the market will be closed today and tomorrow, the local customers are preparing to stock up earlier. The market then rose unanimously in the midst of active buying interest. Xiaojiao reached 119 yuan again, and the market became even tighter in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 30,000 bags and 400 tons. The rice industry will be closed today and tomorrow due to the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice arrived at the port. The SS. Daylite, managed by the British company Gordon Foreign Firm, directly transported a large batch of foreign rice from Myanmar, totaling approximately 28,000 bags, which arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. In addition, the Jardine Matheson's Fusheng ship arrived in Shanghai the night before, transporting 470 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (祖)</p>
<p>Although the supply of newly harvested early and late japonica rice is still not large, the market supply is still abundant. Therefore, most goods owners are willing to sell at lower prices to meet their financial needs for the festival. Occasionally, local native shops also ease up on their purchases due to the approaching festival, causing the market to stagnate. For example, the early Nan Gang rice was sold yesterday at 152-153 yuan, a drop of three to four yuan from the previous day. The Kunshan new japonica rice also opened at only 151 yuan, eventually falling to 148 yuan, a drop of two to three yuan. As for the new Dujian, it was restrained at the critical moment, dropping by one to two yuan, opening at 131 yuan, 130 yuan, and 129 yuan.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice trade has always been small, and it is even rarer during this festival season. The Hong Kong white glutinous rice continued to open high at 143.5 yuan, then fell to 138 yuan. The glutinous lu (green beans) was at 134 yuan.</p>

<p>Stronger demand for flour as people stock up early for the festival</p>
<p>Yesterday, the actual sales of foreign flour were strong, and the retailers were greedy. Moreover, as local customers stocked up early before the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, the market was even more lively. However, the goods owners were settling foreign exchange after setting rates, and the goods en route and in stock were decreasing, which was enough to seize the opportunity to reverse the trend. As a result, the bullish side held on tightly, and local customers and retailers needed it even more. The market price rose gradually. As a result, it rose by 5 jiao (a unit of currency) compared to the previous market. Jinlong Xizhan closed at 33.78 yuan in the morning and rose to 34.1 yuan in the afternoon. Dongzhan closed at 34.25 yuan in the morning and rose to 34.7 jiao in the afternoon. Baotai closed at 35.9 yuan in the morning and 36.12 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Large quantities of flour are being transported north. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship will sail directly to Tianjin today, transporting 14,000 bags of flour from this city. Jardine Matheson's Fusheng ship will also depart for Tianjin today, also carrying over 10,000 bags of flour to Tianjin. This flour is all Australian and Canadian foreign flour that is being transshipped to Tianjin.</p>

<p>Oil Market: Oil Prices Firm and High; Suddenly Hand Grenades Appear in Front of the Gate</p>
<p>It was reported in this newspaper the other day that 2,910 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were distributed yesterday, and large quantities were still being negotiated. However, the edible oil market situation is still difficult to lower under the control of various groups. The market hovers, not much higher or lower than before. The Tongshi market sells more than 100 barrels each of Qingdao raw oil and soybean oil, 20 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil, 500 tins each of Yanting raw oil and soybean oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, nearly 10,000 dan of Dayou Factory's refined oil futures, and about 1,000 barrels of vegetable oil from various factories (prices detailed in the market price section). It was also learned that last night, someone suddenly threw two hand grenades at the entrance of the Cereals Association, and the purpose is unknown.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 470 pieces of imported soybean oil and 180 pieces of raw oil arrived, all from Qingdao.</p>

The total transaction volume was more than 1,000 taels. The increase in cash was still stronger, which was caused by the successive absorption by the Hong Kong help money exchange industry and the jewelry industry, resulting in a gradual increase from 9,400 yuan in the morning to 9,450 yuan at noon, a further increase of 50 yuan. The transaction volume was about 400 taels. Ornament gold was also raised by 10 yuan to 970 yuan.

<p>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth's Arrogance Suddenly Increases; Repeated Peaks Seen; Hoarders Do Not Release Goods; A Huge Increase of Four to Five Yuan in Four Days</p>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's market situation continued to be firm, and cloth prices repeatedly reached peaks. Wholesale sales in the stores on this street have become sluggish, while customer business is still smooth. However, the hoarders' arrogance is rampant, and they are determined not to release the quantities they have purchased. The prices of all types of cloth have increased by another 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Examining the cloth prices at the end of last month, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill have increased by 4 to 5 yuan in the past four days; heavyweight coarse cloth has increased by 4 yuan; and lightweight coarse cloth has increased by 2 to 3 yuan. Calculated on the basis of 40 pieces, each piece of cloth has to increase by a huge amount of 80 to 200 yuan. Yesterday, the Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Nanyang merchants handled more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and bleached cloth, and more than 400 pieces were transacted on this street. Today, 710 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>The futures prices of each month's contract for Longtou (Dragon Head) brand cloth on the exchange increased again by 2 to 4 jiao per piece yesterday. This is because actual sales of spot goods are not thin, and the strong purchasing interest of both internal and external hoarders continues, pulling prices higher and higher. The price of miscellaneous brand fine cloth increased by about 5 jiao per piece. The closing price of Longtou new factory orders was 6 yuan and 4.8 jiao, and the new orders for Sijunzi (Four Gentlemen) serge were 2.36 yuan, all new high prices and the market sentiment was very strong.</p>

<p>Woolens: Cavalry Twill and Tosca Serge Have Seen a Slight Decline</p>
<p>Cavalry twill and Tosca serge have recently been trending downwards. Goods from Yinfeng, Xinxin, Zhanghua, and Yihua have all reported declines. Looking back to ten days ago, the average price drop was roughly 10 yuan per yard, which can be described as a rapid rise and sharp fall. Yesterday, the prices of Tosca serge from various factories had been reduced by 73 to 74 yuan in most cases, and cavalry twill was at 63 to 64 yuan, down to 67 to 68 yuan. The main reason for the sudden decline is that the sharp rise was too great, and buyers and users had accumulated a large quantity, resulting in an abundance of hoarded goods. With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, actual sales of woolens have been slow, and there has been little demand for these coat fabrics. Moreover, industry insiders, recognizing that prices had reached their peak, were generally unwilling to keep large quantities in stock, preferring to sell and replenish as needed. Major and minor factories continue to produce continuously. Under the current high cost of living, it is doubtful whether a 300-yuan coat can still sell as well as before. Demand has decreased, transactions have declined, and internal and external parties are vying to get rid of their stock, resulting in a widespread price decline.</p>

<p>North-South Goods: Orchid Bamboo Shoots Rebound</p>
<p>The price of orchid bamboo shoots had initially dropped by twenty to thirty yuan because of higher than normal quantities arriving, and retailers were uninterested, but the price for it’s cultivation has not dropped as well, so this has made a topsy-turvy situation. Now the stock is active again and the stomach is gradually becoming active, so the price is now back up, and the price is 30 yuan higher than the lower price.</p>

<p>The Tongan longan production area has already started its harvest, and land prices are higher than last year. Because there are currently few goods coming from Quanzhou and Xinghua, each company is trying to do business there. It is said that the total volume is three to four hundred担 (dan, a unit of weight), and the declared cost is higher than the current market price. It is said that they will soon be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, 525 bags of chestnuts and 356 bags of walnuts were all transported from Tianjin the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>Catechu has gradually increased in price recently due to shortages in arrivals and inventory. The market price was previously less than 200 yuan per担, but it has now risen to 230 to 240 yuan, an increase of 40 to 50 yuan. However, the tight situation is still exceptionally strong.</p>

<p>Translation of "Statistical Methods" Published, Co-translated by Li Huang Xiaozhen and Lu Zongwei</p>
<p>Statistical Methods, authored by the renowned American statistics professor Mills, is the most suitable introductory textbook for students studying statistics. It has been published for more than ten years, and its reputation has not waned. Many universities in China also use it. The book focuses on the study of economic and commercial statistical methods, and its advantages are twofold: (1) The theory is precise and avoids superficiality and confusion, and it pays attention to the practical examples set, which can help to draw inferences about other cases. (2) It pays particular attention to the limitations of statistical quantities in application, because statistical quantities are mostly based on mathematical formulas, and must meet certain conditions when applied. The book has a Japanese translation that has been published for several years, but there is no translation in China. Now, Professor Li Huang Xiaozhen of National Chiao Tung University and National Shanghai College of Commerce, and Professor Lu Zongwei of Datong University, Shanghai University, and Lixin Accounting School, have co-translated the original into Chinese based on the September 1935 edition, based on their years of teaching statistics. It is published by the Zhonghua Book Company as a textbook for universities. The translation is fluent and smooth, with no difficult language. The book has beautiful illustrations, clear printing, and 500 pages. It is sold for 15 yuan and 6 jiao, and will be sold at a 20% discount within a month during this special price period.</p>

<p>No Fuel Shortage Expected This Winter; Concerns About a Coal Shortage Can Be Eliminated; Hongkong Company Has Enough Coal in Stock to Meet Needs; However, Continuing to Order from Overseas Involves Risk; The Price of Coal Needed for Three Months Requires US$1 Million</p>
<p>Dalu Bao reports that Mr. Li Fu, Assistant Manager of Hongkong Coal Company, stated to reporters yesterday (the 3rd) that his remarks could dispel the general concern that Shanghai would face a coal shortage this winter. According to Mr. Li, there is currently no shortage of fuel in the city, and Hongkong Company has enough coal in stock to meet needs for some time. However, bituminous coal is not very abundant, and it would be difficult to cope with a sudden emergency.</p>
<p>Overseas Orders Involve Considerable Risk</p>
<p>Due to the tense situation in the Far East, no coal companies in Shanghai are willing to risk ordering large quantities of coal from overseas. Ordering enough coal to supply the city for three months would require US$1 million. Given the current situation, it is not advisable to take this risk. When asked if the coal situation in Shanghai would become critical in winter, Mr. Li replied that he did not think so, but believed that the severity that would determine the future of Shanghai's fuel consumption depended on only two factors.</p>
<p>Two Important Points for the Future of Fuel</p>
<p>Namely, (1) foreign exchange controls, and (2) the possibility of an outbreak of war in the Pacific. Regarding the first point, until October, the Equalization Fund still allowed Hongkong Company to purchase US dollars at the official exchange rate, which is absolutely necessary for the operation of Hongkong Company, etc., because water freight, coal prices, and wages must all be paid in gold yuan. Within this month, Hongkong Company has not yet received the foreign exchange supply from the Equalization Fund. Mr. Li was certainly unable to determine whether Hongkong Company's foreign exchange application had been rejected this month. However, it is quite obvious that Hongkong Company cannot continue to operate if it is not allowed to buy and sell US dollars. (According to reports, the Equalization Fund has announced that it will approve the settlement of coal purchases this month). Secondly, the situation in the Far East must also be considered. No one knows whether the peace in the Pacific will be broken, and war is possible at any time. If that happens, the coal situation in the city will definitely deteriorate, and it cannot be recognized.</p>
<p>The Coal Storage Plan Belongs to Someone Else</p>
<p>When asked why Hongkong Company did not store more coal in Shanghai to meet future emergency needs, Mr. Li did not directly answer this question, but said, "Currently, only the Japanese store coal in the city. The information you are inquiring about may be supplied by the Japanese."</p>

<p>All members of the Shanghai news industry and various people's organizations were greatly encouraged by the great victory in Northern Hunan and yesterday sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang, Commander Xue, and the soldiers on the front lines to congratulate them and express their respect. (1) The telegram from the news industry to Chairman Chiang reads: "To Chairman Chiang in Chongqing, and forwarded to Commander Xue and all soldiers on the front lines: The Battle of Northern Hunan has established unprecedented achievements, created remarkable battle results, and laid a solid foundation for victory. The good news has spread, and we are overjoyed. We respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you and express our respect. The entire Shanghai news industry bows in support." (2) The telegram from various people's organizations to Chairman Chiang reads: "To Chairman Chiang in Chongqing: The Battle of Changsha relied on your wise decisions to demonstrate our military might. The encirclement was successfully completed, resulting in unprecedented achievements, initiating the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction, and serving as a prelude to future victories. We respectfully send this telegram to pay our respects, humbly requesting your perusal." (3) The telegram from various people's organizations to Commander Xue reads: "To Commander Xue in Changsha: Your strategic planning has once again achieved world-class accomplishments. Your steadfast defense and encirclement have demonstrated your strategic brilliance. Dongting Lake is calm, and Yuelu Mountain is more beautiful. Your magnificent plans are worthy of our heartfelt praise. (Remainder omitted)"</p>
<h3 id="e58">New Procedures for Entering Hong Kong: Cash Deposit of HK$100 Now Required; Previous System of Requiring Seven Types of Guarantors Has Been Abolished <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Immigration Department recently officially announced the cancellation of the strict procedures for those who have not yet arrived in Hong Kong but wish to obtain a visa, which previously required a guarantor designated by the department to personally sign a guarantee at the department before a visa could be issued. Since the implementation of the system requiring seven types of guarantors, applicants have found it quite difficult. To improve this, the department has promulgated a new method of using a security deposit, canceling the previous method of guaranteeing entry with seven types of guarantors. In the future, for those who have not yet arrived in Hong Kong but wish to obtain a six-month or two-year entry permit, if their relatives or friends in Hong Kong apply for the permit on their behalf, they only need to pay a security deposit of HK$100 per permit (the same amount is required for both six-month and two-year permits), then fill out an application form and apply for an entry permit. Once the applicant arrives in Hong Kong, they can bring the receipt to the department to retrieve the HK$100 security deposit. This restriction does not apply to those who are already in Hong Kong. This restriction also applies to those who have already obtained a two-year or six-month permit and have left Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Guarantor System: Cumbersome Procedures</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the previous regulations, if one of the seven types of qualified persons wished to guarantee the entry of their relatives or friends, they had to personally go to the department to explain the reason for guaranteeing their relative or friend's entry, as well as their own occupation in Hong Kong, and all their savings, property deeds, and house deeds had to be submitted to the department for verification. The seven types of guarantors specified were: (1) Justices of the Peace in Hong Kong; (2) Barristers or Solicitors practicing in Hong Kong; (3) Chinese government agencies with offices in Hong Kong; (4) Major banks or shipping companies in Hong Kong; (5) Those who hold land deeds in Hong Kong proving that the land is wholly owned by them; (6) Managers of Western Chambers of Commerce or Chinese General Chambers of Commerce, or proprietors or office staff of member companies; (7) Members of stock trading associations or brokerage trading associations, all of whom had the authority to sign guarantees for others. However, most of the above-mentioned people are very busy with work and therefore cannot personally go to the department, making it extremely difficult for those who wish to enter Hong Kong. Although the above-mentioned guarantor system has been abolished, the department still seriously examines the guarantors who guarantee the living expenses of entry permit applicants in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar. All industries in the city, including the silver and money industry, rice and coal industry markets, the authorities of the two concessions, and various factories, are taking a day off. Various industrial and commercial sectors are handling account settlements as usual, which is very busy. Because the supply of financial resources is sufficient, all industries can spend the festival peacefully. Residents throughout the city, as various places across the country are launching fundraising efforts for winter clothing and disaster relief, also expressed their support, donating a portion of the festival expenses to winter clothing donations and disaster relief to show their patriotism and unwillingness to lag behind others. All donations are delivered directly to charitable organizations by the donors.</p>

<p>Recently, the ships of the Taikoo Company have been experiencing many troubles. The Yuezhou wheel caught fire in the bow cabin while unloading cargo after returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 17th of last month. It is currently being handled by spreading water to extinguish the fire. It was also learned that the Anshun wheel of the same company suddenly suffered a fire disaster while unloading cargo in Xiamen the day before yesterday after sailing south from Shanghai at the end of last month. Furthermore, the Beihai wheel, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, reportedly ran aground on the Tongsha ocean surface outside the Wusongkou due to straying off course. The shipowner managed to drag it out, and it entered the port at around 10:00 AM yesterday morning and is currently berthed at Zhanghuabangpu awaiting orders.</p>

<p>The Central Bank has newly minted a type of copper subsidiary coin. The color and quality of the copper are both excellent. It has already been circulated in the inland areas but will not be transported to Shanghai for the time being. The shortage of subsidiary coins in this city has gradually been resolved after a large number of them were transported here by various banks. The public bus fare tokens have been retrieved.</p>

<p>It is reported that three U.S. Yangtze River Fleet gunboats, the Luzon, Oahu, and Wake, suddenly held exercises in the Yangtze River Delta area outside Wusongkou from the 30th of last month to the 3rd of this month. The commander of the fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford, personally commanded the exercise on board the flagship Luzon, departing from Shanghai on Monday (the 30th of last month). The exercise lasted four days and nights, and the Luzon returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM. The Oahu also entered the port and is berthed at the British Navy buoy in Pukou, while the Wake sailed west up the Yangtze River to Hankou. The captain of the Wake, which was originally berthed in Shanghai, is Lieutenant Commander Lilley, with a crew of about 60. It sailed from Shanghai to Hankou in July, and the Oahu, which was originally berthed in Hankou, then came to Shanghai. The captain of the Luzon is Brook, and the number of crew members is about the same as the Wake, including Rear Admiral Glassford's staff. This three-ship exercise demonstrates the U.S. Navy's determination not to abandon the defense of the central China coast and the Yangtze River basin during this period of urgent Far Eastern situation. It is also reported that one U.S. Yangtze River Fleet gunboat, the Tutuila, is moored on the Chongqing River and was recently bombed by Japanese aircraft. The captain of the ship is Bowers.</p>

<p>The Thai merchant ship Suriyothai Nawa, which was detained by the Jianghai Customs and anchored off the Longmao Wharf in Pudong, has reportedly reached a resolution with the Japanese side through the managing company, according to shipping industry sources. The Japanese Kempeitai authorities finally agreed that the ship would be allowed to export if the cargo was unloaded. Accordingly, after the cargo was unloaded at 10:00 AM yesterday, the ship weighed anchor and sailed south.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Dates for Releasing Public Warehouse Rice <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The more than 58,000 bags of public warehouse Xiaowen rice will be sold cheaply by rice shops in the two concessions starting at 9:00 AM on the 11th of this month. According to a report from the Rice Shop Industry Association yesterday, approximately 400 shops have registered and claimed public warehouse rice, totaling 13,000 to 14,000 bags. Today is for member rice shops in the Hongkou District, and tomorrow is for member rice shops in the West Shanghai District. The association hopes that all member shops will enthusiastically purchase rice within the specified dates so that a large amount of public warehouse rice can be sold widely. The association has stipulated the payment and delivery procedures for those who have already claimed the rice and registered: (1) Those who registered on the 3rd (Public Concession) will pay on the 7th and receive the rice on the 8th. (2) Those who registered on the 4th (French Concession) will pay on the 8th and receive the rice on the 9th.

(4) Those who registered on the 6th (West Shanghai District) will pay on the 10th and receive the rice on the 11th. The payment location is Fu Yuan Money Shop, No. 70 Ningbo Road. Only checks will be accepted; cash will not be accepted. The delivery location is the Roosevelt Wharf Warehouse.</p>
<h3 id="e65">If There Are Difficulties with Foreign Exchange Settlements in Various Industries, Permission Will Be Granted to Go to Hong Kong for Explanation; No Changes to Foreign Exchange Settlement Procedures for October <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Dazhong News met with a senior official of the Bank of China yesterday morning and confirmed that the foreign exchange settlement procedures for October are exactly the same as last month, with no changes. The following imported goods are allowed to be settled with foreign exchange: (1) Major imported goods listed in List A, such as rice, tobacco leaves, petroleum products, and coal, will still be provided with foreign exchange according to the quota allocation system. (2) Other important goods listed in List B, such as hemp, cotton, wool, machinery, flour, wheat, sugar, chemical raw materials, paints, oil, newspapers, rubber, tires, and photographic materials, may be provided with foreign exchange after application and approval. (3) Minor imported goods not listed in Lists A and B and the list of prohibited imports may also be settled with foreign exchange, but each transaction is still limited to US$2,000 or £500. (4) Individual remittances, travel expenses, and insurance fees are limited to US$200 or £50 per person per family per month. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has specially approved the operation of foreign exchange banks.</p>
<p>The text of the telegram is as follows: "There are no changes to the foreign exchange settlement procedures promulgated in September. They will continue to be effective this month. If there are difficulties in various industries, the Exchange Stabilization Fund will allow representatives from the industries to go to Hong Kong for explanation." It is now known that representatives from the film and insurance industries have already been dispatched to Hong Kong to meet with members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to request a sufficient supply of foreign exchange to maintain their development. In addition, representatives from the cotton, tobacco, and automobile industries will soon be ready to go to explain the difficulties of their respective industries. The focus of the foreign exchange problem has now shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong. It is expected that after the members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund meet with the representatives of various industries, there will be new solutions to various issues.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Difficult to Decide on a One-Shift Work System, Involving Business Issues <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Business Firms Remain Cold; British Business Firms' Interests Differ Significantly</p>
<p>The "Times" reports that according to Mr. Baker, Secretary of the British Chamber of Commerce, the use of a one-shift work system is difficult to decide because the issue involves a wide range of concerns. The meeting has yet to reach a decision. Other responsible British expatriates say that they can indeed save fuel with a one-shift system, and the benefits are sufficient to compensate for any inconveniences. They are now awaiting the Shanghai Power Company's research results. An employee of the Shanghai Power Company said that if Japanese firms cannot implement it consistently, the hope of saving fuel is slim. Chinese stores have already stated that business is busiest in the afternoon and are therefore unwilling to stop business in the afternoon. As for the Japanese firms, it is reported that their attitude towards the new system is very cold. The opinions of Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and the East Asia Shipping Company can represent the Japanese side. A spokesman for Mitsubishi said that the company is unwilling to consider the plan until the Municipal Council has adopted it. It is questionable whether the company supports it. An employee of Mitsui said that Japanese firms have no intention of considering a one-shift system and does not believe that Japanese firms will support the new system because Japanese firms often communicate with Japanese businesses, and Japan is using the traditional system. Once Shanghai changes the hours, it will greatly harm business. An employee of the East Asia Shipping Company said that if they stop work in the afternoon, they will feel too busy and have no time to rest. Another responsible Japanese said that the Japanese believe that the present time is a time to work hard and be willing to sacrifice. It is expected that the Japanese military authorities will not approve the cessation of office work in the afternoon. Mr. Marshall of the British Chamber of Commerce told reporters that the British Chamber of Commerce discussed the one-shift office system on Thursday evening, but no decision was made. The one-shift system is not entirely beneficial for all business firms. Real estate and import-export firms may adopt this system, but shipping companies and others cannot easily adopt it. His own Xiangxing Foreign Firm is waiting for the decision of the British Chamber of Commerce regarding the change of office hours. If other business firms adopt this system, Xiangxing Foreign Firm will follow suit.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Price Controls on Cooking Oil by French Authorities Remain in Effect <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>In order to achieve the objectives of its establishment, the Price Evaluation Committee of the French Concession previously evaluated and set standard selling prices for cooking oil and ordered all parties to comply. These price controls remain in effect. However, some unscrupulous oil merchants, blinded by greed, dare to disobey and deliberately stir up trouble, fabricate rumors, and confuse people, causing the price of soy sauce to repeatedly exceed the limits, which is illegal. Because cooking oil is a necessity, its price fluctuations seriously harm people's livelihoods. Moreover, the source of cooking oil is still pouring in, the inventory is sufficient, and there is no shortage of outlets, so there is no need to worry about future shortages. The frequent increase in market prices is clearly the result of speculation and manipulation by merchants. The relevant authorities stationed in Shanghai have paid close attention to the actions of speculative oil merchants. According to information disclosed by the flour and miscellaneous goods industry, a large amount of Dalian soy oil was offered for sale in the market the other day, and market sentiment was once weak. But because the rumors did not subside, the market situation ultimately did not ease.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Presbyterian Churches from Various Regions Gather in Shanghai; Japanese Missionaries Cannot Work <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Responsible persons from Presbyterian churches across the country have come to Shanghai over the past two weeks to convene a meeting to discuss important issues such as missionary work in mainland China. Those who came to Shanghai to participate in the meeting included Hayes (Beijing), Carpentar (Guangzhou), Yanzhi (Huaiyuan), Stanley (Nanjing), Romig (Qingdao), Imis (Yantai), and Herbert (Shanghai). It is said that in the past few months, the number of Presbyterian missionaries in various places has decreased slightly, but there has not been a large-scale withdrawal. Originally, there were 350 people, and now 300 remain. Most of those who withdrew were women and children.</p>
<p>Fisher, a missionary from the American Baptist Church in Tokyo, recently came to Shanghai from Japan. According to him, American missionaries in Japan have not withdrawn despite repeated exhortations from the U.S. government to return home during this period of deteriorating Far Eastern situation. Some missionaries have recently withdrawn from Japan because the Japanese environment has forced them to take this action in terms of their work. According to his observations, the withdrawal is not due to changes in the international situation. Fisher estimates that there are currently 150 American missionaries in Japan, compared to 500 a year ago. Some missionaries returned to the United States on vacation, but the State Department refused to issue passports, so they could not return to Japan as scheduled. Currently, no churches in Japan are withdrawing missionaries except for the Methodist Episcopal Church. Even among the Methodist Episcopal Church missionaries, some are still stationed in Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e69">In Memory of Bishop Wei Changlu of Qingdao <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Erqian</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Qingdao knows Bishop Wei Changlu (Rt. Rev. George Weig, S.V.D. DD). When the ship is still three or four miles away from the pier, the building that first comes into view is the exquisite and beautiful Catholic Church that towers on the hillside and soars into the clouds. This is the church built by the Bishop of Qingdao. It is not only the crystallization of his life's work, but also the place where he lived, rested, worked, and prayed in recent years.</p>
<p>Wei was born in Germany in 1883. He entered the Society of the Divine Word as a monk and then specialized in theology and philosophy in Vienna, where he gained a great deal of insight. After obtaining a doctorate in theology, he was promoted to priest. He came to China in 1908 to preach in Shandong Province, serving as the Dean of the Major Seminary in Yanzhou Prefecture for twelve years. Most of the Chinese priests who now populate the Shandong Diocese came from Wei's school. He advocated cultivating Chinese clergy so that the Catholic Church in China could be completely managed by the Chinese, which is not only suitable for China's current national conditions and needs, but also of great importance to the future development of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Archbishop Gang Henyi, the former Apostolic Delegate to China, believed that Wei had made great contributions to the church and China. He personally consecrated him as the Bishop of Qingdao in Yanzhou Prefecture in 1928. The appointment of Wei as Bishop by the Roman Curia was not only celebrated by the Catholics in Qingdao, but also deeply admired by Chinese public opinion. Since then, Bishop Wei has been permanently stationed in Qingdao, devoting his efforts to the church affairs and education of the entire diocese, striving for development, and increasing the number of Catholics and schools. The statistics are all there and need not be repeated. In recent years, the Sino-Japanese War has occurred, and the number of refugees in Qingdao is extremely large. Bishop Wei provided them with clothing and food to the best of his ability. He was so busy with work that he had no time to warm his seat or enter his home. Yesterday (October 3), a telegram came from Qingdao stating that Bishop Wei had been suffering from illness for many years due to overwork. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he unfortunately passed away on the 3rd. Friends in Shanghai were shocked to hear the news and plan to hold a memorial service in the coming days. On his deathbed, Wei was still praying for the peace of China and the Qingdao Diocese. Therefore, the passing of the Bishop of Qingdao is not only a loss to the Shandong Diocese, but also a loss of a good friend in China.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Waste Utilization <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Gui</p>
<p>A Special Visit to the Handicraft Relief Project</p>
<p>Thirty-eight years ago, the Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston, USA, initiated an active and unusual relief effort called Goodwill Industries, or "Charity Crafts." We now call it "Handicraft Relief." Its purpose is to provide work opportunities for the elderly, weak, disabled, unemployed, and ordinary people. It focuses on vocational training, self-help, self-sufficiency, and self-reliance. After the refugee relief work in this city ended, the refugees were scattered in areas such as Nanshi, without work, clothes, or food, and the situation was very miserable. Mr. W.D. Boone, an American expatriate, witnessed this and was heartbroken. He adopted the above-mentioned American method, and the American Presbyterian Church and the Shanghai South Qingxin Church, two well-known Christian organizations, took the lead in founding the Puyi Handicraft Cooperative in 1938. At the beginning, it was founded with a small amount of funds of only 963 yuan, one jiao, and one fen, and rescued five or six refugees every day. It has expanded year by year, and last year it spent 96,000 yuan on relief expenses, rescuing more than 1,000 people every day, and benefiting more than 33,000 people directly and indirectly throughout the year. The progress of its work can be described as amazing. The reporter will now report the actual work of the cooperative to the readers based on the interviews.</p>
<p>The Employed of Handicraft Relief</p>
<p>The purpose of the cooperative's work is to improve the production skills of the refugees and improve their living conditions. Therefore, they are called craftsmen instead of refugees. They are not treated as refugees. All those employed by the cooperative, whether they are in training or already able to work, are given food, clothing, and wages. They work seven or eight hours a day, and the hourly wage is 20 to 50 cents, depending on their work ability and family burden. The cooperative has 37 types of vocational training, such as carpentry, painting, bamboo work, sewing, washing and dyeing, etc., and provides training and assigns work according to the gender, age, and physical condition of the craftsmen. The cooperative's employees can be divided into the following categories: (1) those with physical disabilities, (2) ordinary people who are stimulated by the lack of work opportunities, (3) those who are despised by society and unable to find work on their own, and (4) the elderly who lack support. Among them, women are the majority. The cooperative hopes that when the craftsmen become skilled, they will leave the cooperative and make a living by their skills. Therefore, the cooperative has a job placement department. For those who cannot work outside, such as the elderly, weak, and disabled craftsmen, the cooperative helps them to work at home while maintaining a relationship with the cooperative. In this way, other unfortunate people can continue to enter the cooperative for training, benefiting everyone.</p>
<p>Useless Things, Source of Life</p>
<p>The craftsmen's workshop is located in the Puyi Cooperative Building at Dadongmen in Nanshi. The "raw materials" for the handicraft relief are mostly old clothes and waste materials collected from the outside world, which are modified, renewed, washed, dyed, sorted, and painted before being sold. The proceeds from the sale are used entirely to pay the craftsmen's wages. This newspaper has already reported on the method of collecting waste materials. Readers who sympathize with this active relief work are requested to set up a Puyi bag in each household and put any unwanted or worn-out clothes in the bag at any time and notify the cooperative to collect them. What you think is waste is what many people depend on for their livelihood. The craftsmen's slogan is "It is more blessed to give than to receive," "Use waste to create a livelihood for the poor," and "Turn waste into resources for the poor to produce." Due to limited funds, the facilities in the craftsmen's workshop are insufficient. Therefore, we sincerely appeal to the society. Their needs are: materials, such as cloth and yarn; equipment, such as sewing machines, knitting machines, towel machines, and printing machines. We also hope that if there are enthusiastic people who are skilled in handicrafts and are willing to serve as volunteer instructors for the craftsmen, we would be even more grateful.

<p>Lead type and parts workers, recently demanding wage increases from employers due to rising prices, initiated a joint strike from the day before yesterday. It is understood that relevant parties are mediating to resolve the issue as soon as possible. However, yesterday, a large group of workers went to Yi Cheng Printing House on Zhifu Road, Nan Guo Printing House on An'nan Road, and Da Zhong, Ming Ming, Dong Fang, Yuan Dong, Xin Sheng, and other factories, causing disturbances. The owner of Liang Yi Printing House on Tiantong Road was also beaten by workers yesterday. However, the labor representatives of the industry strongly urged the workers to remain calm and avoid disturbances.</p>
<p>Lead type and parts workers in this city recently demanded wage increases from employers again due to rising prices and jointly launched a strike as a threat. The day before yesterday, more than a hundred workers broke into Xie Wenyi Printing House on Shandong Road, intending to cause trouble. Workers Lu Fuchang, Sun Xiukun, Qian Pubai, and three others were arrested and sent to the Special First Court for punishment on record. Unexpectedly, at 2:50 PM on the third day, several dozen workers swarmed to Tian Hua Tang Printing House at 286 Ningbo Road, sending Gu Linrui, Zheng Linsong, and Chen Fugen as representatives. Inside, they dismantled the printing press and destroyed the typeset lead plates. Finally, they surrounded and beat the store owner, Ding Jinshan, creating a serious situation. Fortunately, Chinese constables from 2629 and other numbers arrived and arrested Gu Linrui. Just as they were about to take him to the police station, the remaining workers Zheng Linsong, Chen Fugen, Liu Jicai, Yao Yunfa, Zhou Jilin, Zhang Baihe, Wang Yijin, Wang Zixiang, Xu Hexiang, and thirty-one others all voluntarily went with him. The General Police Station separately detained them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case, saying that when Gu Linrui was arrested, twenty leaflets were found in his hand. However, considering the situation of the defendants at the time, they engaged in violent and intimidating behavior, and the situation was serious. Demands for wage increases should be pursued through peaceful means and should not exceed the bounds of the law. Currently, this case involves a large number of people, and investigation will take time, so he requested</p>
<p>permission to detain [them].</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendants admitted to going to persuade [others] to strike. According to the case filed by Ding Jinshan, owner of Tian Hua Tang Printing House, Gu Linrui and Zheng Linsong broke into the shop and destroyed lead plates, while Chen Fugen dragged him out and beat him with wooden sticks. Judge Meng adjourned the case to next Wednesday for further hearing, and the defendants were granted detention.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Talking About the Mid-Autumn Festival <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the happiest seasons for children in a year. In terms of clothing, there are single-layered flannel suits (referring to children from wealthy families) and small leather shoes; in terms of food, there are shrimp, crab, fish, meat, lotus seed paste mooncakes, egg yolk mooncakes, ham mooncakes, and Liangxiang chestnuts, white fruits, snow pears, bananas, apples, lotus roots, taro, etc. In terms of entertainment, watching movies, watching Peking opera, etc. ... This Mid-Autumn Festival seems to be unique to the rich. "The moon is exceptionally bright during the Mid-Autumn Festival," it is truly a joyous festival of reunion. However ... what about many poor children? Where do they have a "Mid-Autumn Festival" to celebrate? Their hometown is broken! Their parents took them and fled to isolated islands, worrying about soaring prices every day! Time passes like years! Where is there any "Mid-Autumn Festival"? Children who enjoy happiness, quickly save on mooncakes, entertainment, and other wasteful spending, and help the refugees! Now, I will talk about the historical facts and stories of the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>The old lunar August 15th is called the "Mid-Autumn Festival" because it is in the middle of the three months of autumn. In 1920, the National Government changed the Mid-Autumn Festival to the full moon after the autumnal equinox of the solar calendar, the earliest being September 9th and the latest being October 7th. This year it happens to be October 5th, coinciding with the children's Sunday.</p>
<p>In ancient times, Wu Gang, a man from Xihe in the Han Dynasty, committed an offense while learning immortality and was exiled to cut down the "cassia tree in the moon." The cassia tree was 500 feet tall, and when cut, the tree healed as soon as it was damaged. (See Youyang Zazu.) Li Shizhen said: "The story of Wu Gang cutting down the cassia tree originated from novels of the Sui and Tang dynasties." The poet Li Taibai has a line: "Wanting to cut down the cassia tree in the moon, holding it as firewood for the cold." Bai Juyi also wrote in a poem: "The cassia tree in the moon is reclining, its roots relying on the blue sky."</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks regarded laurel as a sacred object. Those with excellent poetic talent or victory in competitions were awarded laurel leaf crowns to show honor. Later, in European universities, this was also given to scholars. Poets selected by the British royal family were called "poet laureates."</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Story of the Mid-Autumn Festival <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>The abandoned calendar eighth day is a month for eating mooncakes. Chinese people in Shanghai and other cities, once a year at Mid-Autumn, have to eat this delicious mooncake. The right day to eat mooncakes is August 15th. In all Chinese festivals, there are delicious things to eat. Chinese people usually think that August 15th is the day to worship the moon god, so-called Mid-Autumn, everyone knows. And there are many stories to tell. Some Chinese people think the moon is a jade rabbit, so in the beginning, mooncakes were printed with a jade rabbit. According to Buddhist legends, this rabbit believed in Buddhism, and he willingly sacrificed his life for the bodhisattva. To reward his loyalty, he was reborn as the old man in the moon, and this old man is responsible for all the responsibilities of the moon god. In mid-August, in ancient times, women who were usually mothers would cut rabbits out of white paper at night and put them in their daughters' shoes. This is believed that their daughters would soon be selected to marry a satisfactory husband.</p>
<p>In Chinese folk songs, there is a picture drawn with a jade rabbit sitting under a cassia tree in the moon, digging for herbs for immortality. Sometimes a young girl is drawn sitting next to the rabbit.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Types of Mooncakes <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Bai</p>
<p>Mooncakes were obviously an object for worshiping the moon in ancient times, and now they have become something for humans to eat. Speaking of the origin of mooncakes, there is also a story related to Chinese history. It is said that Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty, initially joined the Mongolian army and decided to revolt and overthrow the Yuan Dynasty. In order to facilitate the transmission of secret orders, he made a cake shaped like the moon and put the secret orders inside the cake. This cake was distributed to the subordinates on the Mid-Autumn Festival, so the Mongols would not be suspicious at all. Although the plan failed, the mooncake became popular. Every Mid-Autumn Festival, there is a custom of eating mooncakes. If this story is true, then the creation of mooncakes was as early as the Yuan Dynasty, more than 500 years ago. The popularity of mooncakes is to buy them and send them to the chairman, made by Guanshengyuan. Such a mooncake is probably worth thousands of yuan now.</p>
<h3 id="e91">The King and the Wooden Stick <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Ren</p>
<p>Many years ago, there was a king who, because he liked to roam around, made himself thin and sickly. So, he hired a famous doctor to treat him. The clever doctor, after careful observation, knew that it could not be cured by medicine, but it needed the help of exercise.</p>
<p>Therefore, the doctor brought two heavy sticks made of wood and handed them to the king, and said to him that these two things were the medicine to cure his disease.</p>
<p>The doctor told the king that he must hold the handles of these two wooden sticks tightly and then shake them gradually, swinging them indefinitely until his hands sweat, and then let them stop. Its function is to expel the moisture inside the body. The king obeyed the doctor's words and did this wooden stick exercise every day at a fixed time.</p>
<p>After the king had this exercise, his strength gradually increased and his health improved day by day. Therefore, he greatly praised the effectiveness of the wooden sticks and the doctor's cleverness. After that, he no longer consulted the doctor. But there was nothing in the wooden sticks. It was just made of wood. Finally, he realized that the strange treatment was not the wood stick itself, but the result of his own constant efforts to exercise.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Moon Viewing <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Binjie</p>
<p>The secret beauty is called Chang'e, who stole the elixir of immortality and fled to the moon, so she became immortal. This story has been adapted into a drama and performed on stage, and this fleeing woman is represented by a dance. In recent years, the production methods have also been improved day by day. Especially in Shanghai, the fierce competition among mooncake merchants can be fully seen, but the manufacturing is constantly improved, and the shape of the mooncake is always round because it represents the moon.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are three different types of mooncakes. That is Cantonese style, Suzhou style, and Ningbo style (Nanjing style). Suzhou and Ningbo styles are made the same way, but Ningbo style is generally larger and has more filling than Suzhou style. As for Suzhou style, the filling is more exquisite than excessive. These two types of mooncakes have yellow and charred surfaces, printed with various names, and the most popular is Cantonese style mooncakes, which are harder and baked yellower. It is larger than the Suzhou and Ningbo styles, and looks like foreign biscuits. Regarding the filling, Cantonese style mooncakes also vary, in addition to ham, bean paste, coconut paste, sweet velvet meat, and even lotus seeds, diced chicken and duck eggs, and so on. Usually, the price of Cantonese style mooncakes is also greater than Suzhou and Ningbo styles, and it is not uncommon for one to cost hundreds of yuan. They are also commonly used as gifts, usually around one or two yuan each. The specially made ones are as big as a table, with a whole chicken, a ham, and about a dozen duck eggs inside. It is said that before the war, the largest mooncake made in Shanghai was worth 500 yuan, which was to the subordinates of Jiang Wei.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Moon on Mid-Autumn Night <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>The annual abandoned calendar Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived again today, and many people can be seen on the streets sending festive gifts. With such soaring prices now, why can't we save on this kind of meaningless consumption? There is no festive atmosphere at all in Aliang's home. Aliang's mother only bought a small box of mooncakes, ready to share them with the whole family when watching the moon on the drying terrace tonight, each person can eat one, which is just a decoration.</p>
<p>"Mom, the moon must be round tonight. I heard that there is a Chang'e living in the moon palace, is it true?" Aliang heard that he could only eat mooncakes when watching the moon. He raised this question on the two words of watching the moon.</p>
<p>"Aliang, this is an unfounded myth. In fact, there will be no Chang'e in the moon. You should know that the dark shadows in the moon are not Chang'e, just like our earth, there are rocks, mountains, and plains, etc. When we look at these things from our earth, we see the dark shadows in the moon and mistakenly think they are something else. You should know that it is very cold in the moon. If someone could go there, they would definitely freeze into an icy body. Why is it so cold in the moon? Because there is no air around the moon, and if there is no air, a certain temperature cannot be maintained. Although the moon can also be exposed to the sun, when the sun shines on the stones in the moon, it is exposed to the sun's intense light, and the temperature rises very high, but when the sun does not shine, the temperature drops immediately due to the lack of air. At that time, the heat of the sun's light cannot be maintained firmly, so the temperature of the dark part of the moon is as low as five degrees below zero. Do you think this is terrible? Can we live in such a low temperature? Therefore, not to mention some plants and animals, you can't even find a drop of water in the moon, because this kind of low temperature is really terrible." Aliang's childish question was heard by his father, so he said so much to correct his wrong thinking.</p>
<p>"Dad, then why must the moon on Mid-Autumn Night be round and very bright?" Aliang turned his head and asked the question that he did not quite understand.</p>
<p>"The Mid-Autumn Festival is the fifteenth day of the abandoned calendar August. Every month on the fifteenth, the moon will be round. What is the reason? The moon is sometimes round and sometimes missing because it is changed by the different area exposed to sunlight. The moon will not emit light "its brightness" is completely reflecting the light of the sun, but the place that the sun can reach is only one side, and the other side will not be bright. When we see the moon is round every half month, it is because the side we see is completely exposed to sunlight. The moon is constantly rotating around our earth. When it turns to a place, only half of the side facing us is exposed to sunlight, and the rest is only a little confused and unclear dark shadow. Once every month, the whole moon can be seen, and it feels particularly bright." Aliang's father finished speaking, and it was time to eat dinner.</p>
<p>Tonight, there are more people on the drying terrace watching the moon. Aliang is sitting next to his father, ready to greatly appreciate the Mid-Autumn moon; moreover, he also has mooncakes to eat, it's really good luck.</p>

<p>— Tang Huaiqiu</p>
<p>Since "Zhonglv" was forced to withdraw from "Xuangong" at the end of February last year, it has been five months since it sought a regular performance venue. The lives of dozens of members of the troupe had to be maintained, and these dozens of young comrades have always stayed together and not left. I could not give them even the minimum spiritual comfort, and I could not give a promising fact to prove it. The pain in my heart is really beyond words to describe. At this time, I met Mr. Wu from Shandong Province. Wu is young and promising and has a great interest in drama. He is also sincere and straightforward. Hearing that "Tiangong" was feasible, he was willing to cooperate. Later, with the help of many friends in various aspects, the small bureau of "Tiangong" was built.</p>
<p>On August 16, "Tiangong" opened. "Zhonglv" presented "Grapes and Wine" as its first performance. It was praised by all walks of life, and many people came to watch it. The play was performed continuously for 30 days, followed by the comedy "Under the Pomegranate Skirt". Recently, it has been actively rehearsing "Thousands of Miles of Yellow Sand, Heart of a Beauty". This play is written by Mr. Lantian, a young playwright who is just eighteen years old. It is a great tragedy with Mongolia as the background. The consciousness is correct and the meaning is profound. When I read the play, I was greatly surprised. My friend is Lantian's older brother, so I know for sure that Lantian is eighteen years old. A young man of eighteen can make such a great structure, which is why I am surprised.</p>
<p>The play "Thousands of Miles of Yellow Sand, Heart of a Beauty" is directed by Mr. Wu Jingping. Mr. Wu has studied art for many years and has a history of more than eight years in "Zhonglv". This play is his directorial debut. Mr. Wu worked very hard this time, carefully studying, day and night, without rest. In order to carefully stage this play, all new Mongolian costumes were made, costing a lot of money. They have been working overtime to rush the production, and it has been opened on the evening of October 3.</p>
<p>Huaiqiu has led the China Travel Troupe to perform in various parts of the country for more than nine years. It has been relying on the enthusiastic promotion of people in all walks of life and the encouragement and assistance of friends to exist today. It has been nearly two months since entering the "Heavenly Palace". I wrote this article to give a brief report to people who care about "Zhonglv" and friends who care about Huaiqiu.</p>
<h3 id="e95">In Memory of Physician Shen Shiyi <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Qian</p>
<p>—A Patriot Who Sacrificed Himself for the Country—</p>
<p>Physician Shen, styled Shiyi, courtesy name Gongchi, was a native of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province. He graduated from Zhejiang Medical College and served as a physician at Renji Hospital and the Two-Roads Bureau. After the war, he served in the rear, traveling back and forth between northern Hubei and western Hunan for two years, enduring hardship without complaint. Recently, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha and the battle was fierce, he rushed to Xiangyin to preside over a hospital for wounded soldiers. Unfortunately, he succumbed to illness from overwork and died on September 25th at Chen time (around 8 am). He was 37 years old and left behind a wife and one child each.</p>
<p>These past few days, just as the whole nation was enthusiastically celebrating the great victory at Changsha, I suddenly received the tragic news that my former colleague, Mr. Shen Shiyi, had dedicated his precious life to the motherland in this battle.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this war, many martyrs have sacrificed themselves, and I certainly cannot single him out and praise him excessively. However, because Physician Shen's death stirred two deep emotions within me, I cannot help but say a few words:</p>
<p>First: The Chinese people who remain in Shanghai are too comfortable and too frivolous. Physician Shen was also a clever man, certainly not a fool. He could have remained in Shanghai and lived a comfortable life; yet he resolutely went to the rear, working in an area very close to the front lines, enduring hardship and suffering, which ultimately led to his death! He is certainly worthy of our admiration, while we who continue to live here feel increasingly ashamed.</p>
<p>Second: After the war, Shanghai's market became abnormally prosperous. Many great physicians have become wealthy, riding in cars, building Western-style houses, and being as arrogant as tropical fish kept in the houses of wealthy families. When asking them to see a doctor, they put on a "eating uncooked rice" face, as if they were incredibly important. The rear area desperately needs medical talent, but who is willing to go? They mistakenly believe themselves to be very noble, but compared to Physician Shen, they are simply cowardly and worthless!</p>
<p>I originally did not want to scold people, but feeling saddened by the death of a friend, I cannot help but vent a little. I hope everyone will encourage each other!</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Physician Shen was a famous amateur opera singer. Before going to the rear, he often contributed articles to this publication. His writing was clear and beautiful, and his theories were thorough. He was truly a rare and valuable commentator on Peking opera. Now that he has sacrificed himself for the country, we respectfully extend our highest respect on behalf of this publication!</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: In a Fit of Rage, for the Sake of a Beautiful Woman</p>
<p>Wu Xiang's letter was very long and sincere, filled with persuasive sentiments. San Gui read it again and again, especially the last few sentences about the family's lives being insecure and the father and son never being able to see each other again, which made his heart pound even faster. After thinking for a long time, he decided to follow his father's advice, surrender to Li Chuang, betray the Ming Dynasty, preserve his family's wealth and status, and become a meritorious official of the new dynasty. He then summoned Ma Bao to his tent to discuss important matters, and showed Ma Bao Wu Xiang's letter. Because Ma Bao was the most trusted lieutenant in his army, he always consulted with him on everything. Ma Bao saw that San Gui's intention was already moving, so he said that the rumors of the Ming Dynasty's decline and the "eighteen sons" prophecy had already spread throughout the provinces. Judging from the current situation, Li Mu's strength was on the rise, and in the future, he would unify the world like the Ming Taizu. It would be better to surrender to Li Chuang, and in the future, riches and honor would be boundless. Wu San Gui heard Ma Bao say this as well, so he prepared to announce his intentions to the army the next day, those who were willing to follow would stay, those who were unwilling could leave. He would go to Beijing to receive Li Chuang's title and be reunited with Yuan Yuan. Unexpectedly, on this very day at dusk, the first scout he had sent out had returned from Beijing. Upon seeing Wu San Gui, he was about to report. San Gui immediately asked, "Is my family safe?" The scout replied, "They have been confiscated by Li Chuang." San Gui smiled and said, "As long as I get to Beijing, I'll make sure he returns everything." So he had no worries, except for thinking about Yuan Yuan alone. At the second watch (around 10 pm), another scout returned with a report, saying that the old general Wu Xiang had surrendered to Li Chuang, but was being held captive by Li Chuang, who wanted the old general to write a letter to persuade the commander to surrender.
