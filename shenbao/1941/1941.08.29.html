<p>合衆社二十八日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨日表示、美國將堅持海洋自由、以運輸給養至海參崴、赫爾在招待記者席上、不見對日方之態度作直接之批評、惟於回覆衆問關於美國是吾將堅持太平洋上航運自由時、渠稱、在此項政策米修改之前、新聞記者可認爲繼續生效、消息靈通界表示、美國將與蘇聯採取聯合行動、對日本抗議美國軍用品由海　崴入蘇一事、予以堅決之反駁云、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日華盛頓電　此間官塲昨吾認日本曾因美國裝運戰具經海參崴接濟蘇聯事有何正式交涉、據稱、苟有關於此種性質之討論、則僅由非正式之詢問而起、國務卿赫爾在新聞記者招待席上聲明、關於裝運軍用品經太平洋前往蘇聯事、美國堅持海上自由之政策、或問美國是吾不顧日本反對、始終主張海上自由、以運出其物品、赫爾答稱、實際上可謂如此、直至此種政策將來變更時而後止、至於日本向美正式交涉海參崴運輸之可能性、則渠目前不欲發言、而願聽東京外務省　之云、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日華頓電　美海長諾克斯昨在新聞記者招待席上答美國海軍準備援蘇與吾之問話、謂渠無成見、渠未有擬派海軍軍官一人參加莫斯科談話或增派莫斯科大使館海軍武官之意、美政府屢以遣派美國觀戰員前往戰區爲請、但無效果、渠希望業新聞者設法勸斯達林准觀戰員赴前敵云、</p>

<p>路透社二十八日華盛頓電　日駐美大使野村、昨訪問國務卿赫爾、事前野村告新聞記者、渠不擬提出正式交涉、迨晤談後又謂曾討論許多問題、惟關於對蘇運輸事則不置一詞、記者問供應品運往蘇聯而不運往日本、日本對之得不抱不滿感想吾、野村答曰、心理上或若是、</p>
<p>路透社廿八日華盛頓電衆料日大使野村今日將晋謁羅斯福總統、據觀察家之意見、此項會見對於美·日關於太平洋意見之衝突、或有極重大關係、至於野村是吾將遞交東京方面之任何正式照會、則尚無所聞、</p>

<p>台衆社二一十八日東京電　報知新聞撰述武藤本日稱、日本所臨之危急局勢、時已達到最嚴重之階段、因此全國皆盼望政府表示勇氣、武藤敦促政府在尙有和平解決之餘地時、毫不猶豫推進外交攻勢、以表現此種勇氣、但如無此項情形則日本應迅速行動、蓋浪費時間、實有百弊而無一利云、渠言、政府應作一決定、吾人旣非親英或親美亦決非德國之第五縱隊、坦白言之、</p>
<p>吾人乃日本之第五縱隊、吾人所最希冀者、乃日本之福利云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十八日東京電　日本時代廣知報、本日午刊譯載今晨報知新聞所載之論文謂、日本與　·美間、尙有從事外交談判之餘地、報知新聞之論文、係著名評論家小室所作、　稱、太平洋危機有談判之可能、因美國及英國決不歡迎日本在跳板上跳動也、但渠警吿日本、在此項談判中、決不可採取「塡充罅隙」政策、而應採取堅決之立塲、以拒絕英·美之「最大要求」、小室又言、如美國油船將油及軍火運至海參崴、則係直接對日本挑戰、渠叉言、美國對於海上自由之强解、即使在太平洋之東半部獲得承認、決不能在西半部獲得承認云、</p>

<h3 id="c12">英蘇進軍中之伊朗問題 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>英蘇軍的開入伊期，至今已歷四日，據傳伊方已要求停止軍事行動，而以驅逐境內德人爲條件，其是吾可以順利迅告解決不可知，但可斷言英蘇此舉已使反侵略陣綫淸除了一個重大的隱憂。</p>
<p>自從納粹侵英不逞，轉而亟謀切斷大英帝國的肢體，近在一隅即爲其所最置重的目標。去秋德方勢力迅速沿着丹瑙河向束南擴展，囊括羅保，攻佔南希，同時更以大軍渡過地中海增援北非，把英軍迫退到埃及邊境以內，在戰略上已然佈置好鉗形攻勞的兩翼。但牠却並小立時循着一定的公式去進攻，却準備從土耳其烏克蘭另闢東進之路，並在小亞細亞附近進行必要的措置，此着　果能得手，則英軍在近東即便還不至陷入絕境亦將極感應付的棘手。是以英軍已往在伊拉克和叙利亞兩度主動的攻勢，正是一種英明而及時的措置，至少消滅了近東一部分危機。但只有伊朗還繼續是一個重大弱點，因爲彼時英蘇隔閡尙未打開，蘇聯與伊朗間具有悠久而深厚的關係，使英方不能不有所顧忌，這一猶豫期間，也就給予納粹以加緊在伊從事活動的機會。</p>
<p>蘇德戰爭的爆發，在納粹方面固然具有多樣的目標，但無疑其重要奢望之一是攫得高加索與近東的油田並進而切斷英國本土與印度澳洲間最近捷的交通錢。最近蘇德戰事側重南路，雖然從尼泊河到高加索和近東還有千哩以上的距離與高加索山的天險阻隔，但不可吾認此兩地帶已受相當威脅，假如伊期局勢有變，則不單英蘇油源有立遭破壞之虞，而且近東英軍與南俄苦戰的蘇軍都將要遭受背腹受敵的危險，這無疑也就是最近月餘以來納粹銳意在伊從事佈置的用意所在。</p>
<p>伊期在地理上是通印度的孔路，控制着「空中蘇彝士」—波斯灣—的交通。又是英國重要的油源所在，因此在英國自然極端重視英伊關係的重要性，而伊方則無時不謀收回油源擺脫英方控制。至於蘇伊之間的關係，在歷史上本與英伊情形不相上下，在俄國革命後，曾經放棄若干在伊特權，贊助其國民革命運動，但在伊當局看來，却始終和英國同爲伊期前途發展上的障礙。伊朗跼處兩大之間，於是便想引入第三勢力以牽制英蘇，東部採油權的讓與美國，聘請美方顧問整理財政，都是此一政策的具體表現。而納粹勢力亦遂乘着此一空隙侵入伊朗，美國財政顧問的後繼者就是兩個德人，至於當地所雇用工程師更以德人爲主體，十年以來，德國在伊經濟勢力不斷膨脹並乘英伊經濟糾紛加以離間，乃廣泛造成了第五縱隊的基礎月餘以來納粹配合着其軍事企圖，遣派大批人員潛入伊境，邇來不斷有警號傳來，而伊政府在英蘇迭决警告之後，始終淡然視之，這如果不是像日前電訊所傳，是由於伊政府尙未充分認識此一形勢的危險，便一定是在德方人員挾持之下，致伊當局已沒有從事斷然應付的充分自由。</p>
<p>但是這一問題並不僅關係着近東與高加索，假使納粹陰謀眞在伊期獲逞，一定會進而發展爲更重大的危機。所謂「打到倫敦的大道，必須經過德里（印度首都）」的理論，在納粹方面當然耳熟能詳，而另一方面，泰國也絕不就是日本南進的終點，東西兩大暴力在行動上　匯合，是可能以伊期問題爲焦點而吿實現的。則英蘇此一當機立斷的主動措施，對於亞歐雙方都具有十分重大的意義。當蘇德戰事甫經爆發，英政府即更調彼時正對叙利亞用兵的華維爾將軍任印度軍總司令，此其用意曾引起若干人士猜疑，連英國國會中也有人斥爲並非必要。然而到現在却不能不佩服英當局的遠見：爲了杜絕東西暴力的匯合，在印度正需要一個幹練沉穩的統帥，更何况華維爾深通蘇聯情事，爲了進行近束的英蘇共同動作，又正是最適宜的人材。</p>
<p>即使伊政府已遭納粹挾持，但是伊國上下對於英蘇向無深讐，當不致爲了侵略者的利益而替納粹担負遏阻英蘇軍的任務。是以不論伊方所要求的停戰是小能夠迅速實現，在英蘇軍四面合圍之下，此一局勢當可早告澄淸。彼時不只納粹東進的危險性可告减輕，美國戰具的運蘇也可在波斯灣另闢一條安全便捷的通路，並且在動搖中　土耳其亦當重告安定，使近東半壁再不虞遭受侵略的威脅。如果英蘇間的軍事合作能夠以伊朗事件爲起點而迅速開展，當必能發揮重大效果，縮短擊潰納粹的歷程。反侵略戰爭的前途是光明的。</p>

<p>愛沙尼亞京城泰林　傳遭撤退紅軍焚毀</p>
<p>合衆社二十八日瑞典京城電此間人士頃稱、不久可自東南方面進入泰林之德軍、將見該波羅的海邊最美麗之城市、僅剩一片烟燄、因昨日人們已淸晰見此愛沙尼亞京城上空之火光燭天、起初人們以爲僅船舶及海港着火、但今日此間已確悉該城全部已因蘇聯焦土政策而犧牲、赫爾辛基消息稱、該城火光五十英里外之芬蘭灣上空猶可見之、</p>

<p>路透社廿八日倫敦電　路透社外交訪員稱、從南北兩路開入伊朗之英蘇軍隊、其所遇之伊軍抵抗力甚爲微弱、而其所經各地之民衆、則對協的軍殊形和諧、德黑蘭當局現已明瞭其實施拖延政策之結果、徒使伊朗陷入嚴霍危局、伊朗政府曾以閃電手段向英蘇兩國龐大的匯台力量挑戰、雖經英蘇加以極殷切之警吿、仍未有認眞舉動、以杜絕德方特務份子潛入或减少境內德方特務份子之人數、今英蘇之打擊已臨、伊朗政府似已改變態度而提出性質較爲廣泛之新建議、衆信伊王已通知英公使布賴德爵士、謂伊朗政府願於一週內逐出全體德人、僅少數不可缺少之德技師暫予留用、一俟接代人才練成、即予解僱、然英蘇政府現巳採取消除德方第五縱隊之步驟、伊政府此種建議、不免失之過晚、無疑的英蘇對於伊朗政府之建議、將予以極大之考量、但非至軸心國在伊朗之潛在威脅完全消滅、則業已發動之軍事行動、顯不能中止、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日莫斯科電關於蘇軍在伊朗進展之情報、仍寥寥數語、但據蘇方公報所述地名觀之、蘇軍進展頗速、且未遇抵抗、察蘇軍入伊之前進速皮、其大部份顯係摩托化軍隊、蘇方報紙力言蘇聯對伊朗人民、並無惡感、眞理報載文、謂伊朗社會、仍具封建性質、地主收租極昂、而伊軍中法西斯軍官、均受希特勒之影響云、</p>

<p>伊朗事件　即可解決</p>
<p>合衆社二十八日土京電　外交方面本日相信、由於旋風式外交活動之結果、伊朗局勢即將有妥協之解決、昨日下午七時三十分土爾共總統伊諾奴曾與英國大使許閣森作長時間之會談、事前土外長薩拉卓咚　博士、曾與伊朗英國蘇聯德國義大利美國及阿富汗等國之使節會談、據悉、伊朗大使曾　土外長謂、在伊朗內閣　長時間之會議後、及伊王在德黑蘭與英蘇使節作幾不中斷之談話後、伊朗政府已決定覓取妥協、此間伊朗外交方面昨晚語合衆社稱、伊朗並不希望將戰事延長、軍事觀察家稱、伊朗之最重耍軍事據點、皆已爲英軍及蘇軍所佔領、實己毫無抵抗、故自軍事活動方面觀之、伊朗戰事可認爲業已結束、</p>

<p>上海英商麥加利銀行總經理即外商銀行公會　會長霍金士、暨美商花旗銀行總經理麥凱兩氏、以奉中國外匯平準基金委員會電召、赴港參加平準會第二次全體會議、已於昨晚乘太古公司之江蘇輪首途赴港、該輪定今晨六時出口南駛、又平準會駐滬美幫辦泰萊博士已先是於前日下午一時許、乘怡和公司裕生輪赴港、英委霍爾巴樞氏、因英大使館方面要務待理、並未同行、</p>
<p>泰萊博士先期成行</p>
<p>國中外匯平準基金委員會、為商討整個上海外匯問題、決在港舉行第二次全體會議、主席陳光甫·華委席德　·貝淞蓀·及美委福克斯等均已先後自渝飛港、同時急電駐滬之美幫辦泰萊博士及麥加利·花旗·兩行經理、敦促速即赴港、參與會議、泰萊博士寓居都城飯店、原定二十六日啓程赴港、後因輪船關係、始延至前日（二十七日）下午乘裕生輪成行、泰氏待會議結束、仍將返滬、</p>
<p>外商銀行參與會議</p>
<p>至麥加利·花旗兩銀行疫情經理霍金士與麥凱兩氏、因準備不及、未能與泰萊同行、遂延至昨晚啓程、乘太古江蘇輪赴港、該輪定於今晨六時出口、霍金士氏為上海外商銀行公會會長、當然代表上海外商銀行這利益、此次偕花旗經理麥凱同去、將在平準會議席上、表示滬外商銀行對上海匯市管理問題之態度與意嚮、</p>
<p>討論原則傳為四項</p>
<p>此次會議、重要因素有四、（一）如何通過平準委會之調整工作、使中英美金融密切聯繫、（二）如何充實平準基金、隨時供給必需品進口外滙需要、（三）如何加緊英美對華人資金之凍結、使國內外資金、無從外逃、（四）如何促進中英美之合作措施、以消除上海外滙之黑市、開會日期、大致為下月一日、</p>
<p>管理滬滙三個步驟</p>
<p>昨日出版之英文金融商業週報云、對旬日滙市變化、曾詳加檢討、於未來趨勢、會作如下之評論、美國委員福克斯氏之幫辦泰萊博士、現已在滬、擘劃平準工作、泰萊本人雖非平準委員會之會員、但渠已盡其力之所能、務使該金融機構、有滿意之工作、最近被委為平準基金委員之霍爾巴樞、刻已抵滬、渠或將獲得必要之權力、以便立即決定、否則即應另設上海小組會、授以相當之權力、以免每事必須向香港呈報、而引起延緩、此為第一步、第二步應開明各種主要輸入、物品名單、准予照新滙率供給、如工部局經由香港或緬甸輸入食米、即為此種主要輸入之一、第三步應立即解決一般人民所　心之小問題、如繳付保險費等、蓋國外保險費必須以外匯繳付也、此等問題在平準基金委員看來、似乎細微小事、不値注意、但其實此事有關數千薪水階級人民之利益非淺、故官定之滙率、不應僅為商界着想、否則公衆人民仍無利益可沾也、</p>

<p>字林報云、星期一夜、虹口區有兩人遭暗殺後、日海軍陸戰隊即在蘇州河各橋上嚴格搜查車輛行人、星期一夜之暗殺案、發生於兆豐路熙華德路口、記者昨（二十七日）赴該　區巡行一週、見行人熙攘、除計有日衛兵一名外、情况已復原、</p>
<p>排列成行逐一受檢</p>
<p>惟中外居民欲入浜北者、已因此暗殺案而大受影響、過外白渡橋時、均須列成長行、逐一受日衛兵搜查、並檢騐防疫證、有須竚立半小時以上、始得過橋者、華籍婦女亦受搜查、外僑祇須出示防疫證、</p>
<p>街頭情景顯已平靜</p>
<p>記者昨過外白渡橋北行、入虹口本部、未見異常之情景、居民生活如常、星期一夜暗殺案之種種徵象、均已消失、亦不見日衛兵或巡邏隊、沿虹口浜西行至斐倫路、除橋上日衛兵外、亦無軍事活動之象、浜中舢舨開泊、偶有一二小販、沿街叫賣、衝破沉寂、</p>
<p>市中心區亦有佈置</p>
<p>沿四川路至日陸戰隊兵營近處、亦無軍事活動、但抵江灣路、情况頓異、鐵路綫上與江灣路左側、已架就鐵絲綱與防舍、足見市中心區亦有軍事佈置、沿蘭路浜上、亦有此種之事建築物、該浜上有兩橋已封閉、他橋則從下午四時起斷絕交通、</p>
<p>華德路橋業經封閉</p>
<p>華德路橋亦從午後四時至上午八時予以封閉、河間路橋與廣州路橋均已架就鐵絲綱、完全斷絕交通、日方此等行動、是否由於近起暗殺案、抑因其他政治緣故所致、現未可知、但一般人均信日方封閉楊樹浦區各橋樑、乃一種軍事戒備、以防復起暗殺活動、</p>
<p>日方否認有暗殺案</p>
<p>同時、日陸軍發言人秋山昨切實否認狄思威路有日方某高級軍官被日兵一名槍殺之說、但外傳確有其事之謠諑仍熾、迄今未能從任何方面獲得證實、至於行人車輛入浜北遭搜查之舉、將於何時吿終、尚難獲得消息、聞搜查辦法、或將繼續施行至週杪、甚至下週始已、但此後四十八小時情勢頗有好轉可能、</p>

<p>昨洋米本客實銷見旺、市氣頗見活潑、投機幫趁機活動、市面乃見欣欣向榮、緣米價連朝下跌、市價久低於公賣價格、木客實銷及囤戶隨以合劃添辦、且有因目前的貸幣發生一些刺激、拋皮球又以爲是一個可乘機會、可以撈摸、獨不見連日外滙平準工作如何猛進、法幣難道尙有問題、然而眼前的米商究竟可以利用、故小絞米自一百十五元漲達一百十八元、英華司小絞及敏黨路貨均自一百四十一二元漲達一百四十四元、現自一百三十九元至一百四十一元、二號暹邏一百三十二元、統比前價較大二三四元不等、但漲後忽聞公賣小絞將减低六元、以普及市民之福利、並傳有餘額小絞一萬三千包將以一百四十一元七角半一包售與行號作自由賣買、因此人心向下、市又被抑一二元、全日成交不下二萬五千包、英華司亦達一千噸、</p>

<p>厚薄粳國米市、續以到貨寥落、堅俏異常、本鄉店胃既恐向隅、互相爭辦、而貨主乘機扳佾、所以結果、若南港早稻開百五十七元至百五十五元、繼漲三四元之巨、無錫白粳高貨皆以乏貨無交易、僅中宿者開百四十七元至百四十五元、高大市百五十三四元、亦增二三元之砠、至於浦東新粳則因銷路不廣、略爲帶高元外、開百五十七元、百五十六元半、</p>

<p>紗市續升、但趨勢益呈迥旋之局面、廣幫需要尙稱不薄、買去念支紗居多、所以人心良好、空頭抵補、進方加碼、市盤續向高峯推進、兩日來美棉漲起四五十磅昔、當亦有關、但東洋紗廿支藍鳳月琴趨勢、較爲軟弱、大概盈利者出籠之故也、四二支細紗情况亦疲、因之紗市狀况、或有度徘徊矣、據云大戶有多有空、雙方皆有旗鼓相當力量、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百三十一元、低價爲一千七百十六元、午後開盤爲一千七百一十八元、漲至一千七百三十一元、繼後絡續回鬆至一千七百十八元、收盤價爲一千七百二十元、以後做至一千七百二十一元、</p>

<h3 id="c68">學府一鱗半爪　先生是獃子非強盜　學生會製造迷魂湯 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>吃　猻王這種開口飯，老實話，除了本身內在的困難而外，還有那些神通廣大的小朋友，偶而—幸虧只是偶而！給你動動小心眼兒，也把你弄的應付爲難，啼笑皆非！我現在就把靑年們道種豐功偉業記錄個一鱗牛爪，—至少也可以說是學界的吉光片羽—以供欣賞；吾則隱沒不彰，豈不叫學術史上蒙受重大的損失麼？再者，所供句句是實；如有虛言，甘墮拔舌地獄，亞孟！</p>
<p>恭上尊號</p>
<p>鄭板橋先生說敎員是『無鎖無枷自在囚；』我則爲他還有和强盜並駕齊驅的資格哩：何以見之？於有綽號見之。夫强盜，有綽號者也；而教員呢，則經青年們那犀利的目光，嚴密的觀察以後，不久，就會按頭製　的給你上一道維妙維肖的尊號，雖說偶然觸景生情，臨時加冕也是有的。我小子旣不享特權，何能例外？於是有一次講書講到公元十六世紀初西班牙人Cortez征服墨西哥的歷史時，有位同學把我寫在黑板上的Cortez一字，故意字一頓的念成「高，二，獃，子！」馬上來了個應聲虫：「高二獃子，」緊接着又一個，還夾雜旁人的笑聲！我想，對於我的「恭上尊號典禮，」大概是這樣就算舉行完畢了。不過，我應該特別向靑年們致謝的，是他們沒有把那道道地地的「强盜」名色送給我，而稱我爲「書獃子」，倒眞是我的知己哩。</p>
<p>迷魂有湯</p>
<p>有一次在考試卷子上，看見描述周幽王的歷史說：「……褒姒不愛笑，乃舉烽火招諸侯來。她看見了，很是好笑；她笑的極其美麗媚人，好像對周幽王灌了一碗迷魂湯……」夫改考卷，苦事也！有此「絕世妙文」欣賞，眞不覺令人笑顏逐開矣！我自己那時也酸勁大發，胡亂謅了一首打油詩：「美人不笑苦君王，奇計烽烟透上蒼；瓠犀粲然艷麗極，濃濃一碗迷魂湯！』</p>
<p>狗刀虎刀</p>
<p>同時，眞是無獨有偶！另本卷子述周厲王的暴虐說：「……遂設「狗頭刀」及「虎頭刀」；有誹謗之者，平民死狗刀之下，大臣死虎刀之下……」我除了佩服它的博引詳證，足補史乘之不足外，眞是游夏不敢贊一辭！</p>
<p>麟辨雌雄有一天在課堂裏，不知道怎麼遇着麒麟二字，於是忽然有人立起來在問了：『先生！麒麟是公的是母的呢？』我敢保定我不寃枉他，這是一位對「紅學」有研究的人，或者剛已看罷翠縷和湘雲討論陰陽問題那一節文學也說不定哩。要是講針鋒相對，俏皮一點回答的話，應該說：『閣下旣不是翠縷，區區也不是湘雲，這問題還是不要討論吧……』可是我怎好眞的這樣作呢？那麼，只有用遁辭了……。</p>
<p>明日請早</p>
<p>現在避難在上海的靑年，的確是太多太多了！他們在茶館，酒樓，舞廳，影戲院，或旁的一切娛樂塲所玩膩了以後，不能不鑽到學校裹消遣消遣。在他們心自中，大概看敎員演獨幕劇，同看京戲，…或者同看玩猴舞馬，根本沒有什麼分別吧。有一天是最末後一課，當我喊叫的口乾舌燥喉嚨痛，而忽然下課鈴在饗如逢大赦的時候，淸淸楚楚的聽見有人說了：「明日請早！」你說！你有什麼話說？……</p>
<p>編者按：請劍農先生不要悲觀。「迷魂湯」「狗頭刀」之類的說法，雖未中肯綮，不爲大雅所許，却也略見一種靑年學子的不依規矩的活力，先生如不厭煩，何妨用道力來誘導敎正一下？</p>

<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>「吳小姐，你家裏來了一個人，說有急事要見你。」他很匆忙地朝着梅寳說。</p>
<p>她才離家不到一個禮拜，父親有什麼急事，要派人來呢？這就不由不使梅寳感到極度詫異了。</p>
<p>「他可曾吿訴你我家裏出了什麼事嗎？」</p>
<p>「這倒沒有。此刻人還在門房裹，你快些下去吧！」陳大說完這話，自己便旋過身子走了。</p>
<p>王告監和那三個同學，也就忙着催促梅寳快走。</p>
<p>「總不致爸爸又害了病吧。」她一路飛奔下樓，一路還不斷的在腦海裹左思右想的胡猜：「也許是那個整天喝得醉薰薰的趙老伯已把媽找回來了，所以小狗子急着要來把我我回去。」可是待她衝進門房，一看來人，却根本不是小狗子。</p>
<p>「姑娘，不好啦！家裏又出了事啦！」梅寳雖不認識這個人，這個人一瞧見梅寳，却就立刻迎上來，透着極憂急的神氣向她說。</p>
<p>這麼一個陌生人，突然向他說話，梅寳的心裹，當然覺得非常突兀。可是瞧這人的打扮，却完全是一個鄕下的莊稼人，年紀也有四十開外了，而且說話也帶着樟樹屯的土音，神氣又是十分忠厚。</p>
<p>「你是誰啊？」梅寳向他呆看着問。</p>
<p>「我就是小狗子的母舅啊。姑娘，你怎麼不認識了？」那個人把頭上的一頂破氈帽揪了下來，似乎奔得很熱很累的樣子。「就爲昨矢飯後；屯裏馬家的兒子跟小狗子爲了賭錢打架，你爸爸做人太好，自己趕去給他們勸解，不料那個該殺的馬老四，反把他老人家打了兩拳，不巧都打在前胸上，回來就吐了許多血。……」　（一九七）</p>

<h3 id="c71">組織消費合作社 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 方堅頌</p>
<p>生活費用的日益高漲，道見大家一致承認的事實。事實上我們的進款總難有加到十倍的希望的。物價近在繼續不停地跟着時間」，「謠言風浪」，等等日夜地在「向上爬」，而我們的生活，也就不得不隨着一天艱苦一天。</p>
<p>可是，活得好一點的要求，總楚每一個人都有的。而此刻除了爭得「開源」之外，「節流」也還是重要的。</p>
<p>這裏的一個辦法，是在「老店新開」，也是「舊書新抄」的把戲！從個人的「節流」到集體的「節流」。</p>
<p>所以，要是靠個人來節約，任怎麼樣，也休想跳得出這個「如來佛的手掌心」。但是，只要集大家的力量來一幹，可就不同了——在消費合作社裹，我們可以吃到，用到較市面上便宜得多的東西。這一組織，無疑，是職員們的「對症良藥」。</p>
<p>至於怎樣組織，我想，上海的「海關俱樂部合作社」，和「銀錢業聯誼會消費合作社」，是可供我們作爲參考的。而裹面的販買品，在剛開始的時候，可以簡單些，暫以米，煤，油等等食料，燃料爲主要商品，待業務發達以後，慢慢的再事擴充。而貨物的來路，儘可能的設法從產地直接運送。（當然，這是需要較大規模的合作社，但也不妨通過各業的聯絡，而山幾個合作社來共同採辦，就較爲容易成功。）</p>
<p>關於股款的來源，不外如下三種方法：</p>
<p>一、請各業領袖或老闆等自動認股。</p>
<p>二、向各方幕集捐款。</p>
<p>三、由職員們自行認股。</p>
<p>這幾種方法，據筆者的估計，是有實現的把握的，因爲，在賢明的商界領袖，和直屬的上司——老闆或經理——是會同意這樣的組織的。</p>
<p>同樣的，在職員們的生活較爲安定以後，在職物上也會受到較好的影響。</p>
<p>同時，從這合作社裏，無形的，許多不相識的同業都會由此而慢慢的熟識，而感情上也可聯絡起來，有空的時候更不妨常聚在一起談談生意經，或許能從經騐中發現出心得來</p>

<p>女小孩帶着哭聲在叫喊了：「殺頭鬼！死烏龜！儂敢打人？弄脫儂鋼筆那能？儂自家又不會賺銅板，神氣點什麼。</p>
<p>「小娘鬼！儂再響！」「拍」！又是重重地一下。繼着又聽見那女小孩在地上打滾的聲音</p>

<p>— 靜遠</p>
<p>一個死去了的藝人，經過悠久的十五年，還始終有一個鮮明的影子留在每一個觀衆的腦中，除去了默片時代號稱「影迷大情人」的范倫鐵諾（Rudolph　Valentino）外，還有誰？</p>
<p>前幾日是范倫鐵諾的逝世十五週年紀念日，本刊已有紀載，這裹略述一些關於他的生平簡史。</p>
<p>首先我要說他不是美國人，他的父親是意大利人，他的母親是法蘭西人，他的原名極長，魯道夫范倫鐵諾這名字，是他在一九一三一年到了美國後更改的。</p>
<p>他父親是意大利騎兵隊隊長，但却叫兒子去學農業，所以他第一年到紐的，找的職業便是園藝工作，一方面他學會了當時極流行的舞蹈，第二年就加入了歌舞團。接着電影事業勃興，他就跳進了好萊塢，最初他只演喜劇片，一直到「茶花女」完成，才開始轉變作風，一九一三年的「碧血黃沙」，和一九二四年的“Monsieur　Beaucaire”都獲得十大鉅片第三名的榮譽，其他名片如「四騎士」等都賣座極盛，使派拉蒙賺了許多錢，他的名字風靡全美，崇拜他的女子不知有多少，有幾個甚至爲他相思而死，他雖結婚，但仍被稱爲「影迷大情人」，那時候考爾門還是小角兒，范朋克和的翰巴里摩亞的名望遠不及他，他死前的六年實爲畢生黃金時代</p>
<p>一九二六年他拍完了一片後，赴紐的度一個假期，八月二十三那天，不幸游泳遇難，雖經名醫急救，但終於長眠不省了。</p>
<p>他只活了三十一歲，如果他活到現在，也有四十六歲，比考爾門還年輕得多呢！每年八月二十三日，總有二個女人在范倫鐵諾墓前徘徊流連，不論在風暴雨，每年必到，今年大概不會例外吧！</p>

<h3 id="e1">United States Secretary of State Explicitly States: Upholding the Policy of Freedom of the Seas; Japan Protests the Issue of Military Supplies Transported to Vladivostok; The United States and the Soviet Union Will Adopt Joint Actions to Refute This <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 28th Dispatch: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the United States will uphold the freedom of the seas to transport supplies to Vladivostok. During a reception for journalists, Hull did not directly criticize Japan's attitude. However, in response to public inquiries about whether the United States would insist on freedom of navigation in the Pacific, he stated that news reporters could consider the policy to remain in effect until it is amended. Informed sources indicated that the United States will take joint action with the Soviet Union to strongly refute Japan's protest against the shipment of American military supplies to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th Dispatch: Official circles here yesterday did not acknowledge that Japan had made any formal representations regarding the United States' shipping of war materiel to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. It is claimed that any discussion of this nature has only arisen from informal inquiries. Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference that the United States is adhering to its policy of freedom of the seas regarding the shipment of military supplies to the Soviet Union via the Pacific. When asked if the United States would insist on freedom of the seas to transport its goods despite Japanese objections, Hull replied that, in effect, that was the case, until such a policy is changed in the future. As for the possibility of Japan formally negotiating with the United States regarding transportation through Vladivostok, he did not wish to comment at present and preferred to hear from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated yesterday at a press conference, in response to a question about whether the U.S. Navy was prepared to assist the Soviet Union, that he had no preconceived notions. He had no intention of sending a naval officer to participate in the Moscow talks or of increasing the number of naval attachés at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The U.S. government has repeatedly requested to send American observers to the war zone, but without effect. He hoped that news reporters would try to persuade Stalin to allow observers to go to the front lines.</p>
<p>The Soviet and Japanese Ambassadors Separately Visit the U.S. Secretary of State</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 27th Dispatch: Soviet Ambassador Umansky and Japanese Ambassador Nomura visited the State Department one after the other today and held talks with Secretary of State Hull. At a time when the situation in the Far East is tense, and amidst reports from Moscow that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Tatekawa has lodged a formal protest with the Soviet government against the transport of American military supplies to the Soviet Union via the port of Vladivostok, the simultaneous visits of the Japanese and Soviet ambassadors to the State Department inevitably aroused various speculations in diplomatic circles. When Nomura left the State Department, reporters asked him about the matter. Nomura replied with a smile that he did not wish to issue a formal statement regarding the issue of American goods being supplied to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok, but that this matter had become one of the issues in U.S.-Japan relations, and he hoped it could be resolved amicably.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th Dispatch: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday. Beforehand, Nomura told reporters that he did not intend to make a formal representation. After the meeting, he said that many issues had been discussed, but he made no mention of the matter of transport to the Soviet Union. When reporters asked if Japan would harbor feelings of dissatisfaction about supplies being transported to the Soviet Union but not to Japan, Nomura replied that that might be the case psychologically.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 28th Dispatch: It is generally expected that Japanese Ambassador Nomura will meet with President Roosevelt today. Observers believe that this meeting may have a significant bearing on the conflict of opinions between the U.S. and Japan regarding the Pacific. As for whether Nomura will deliver any formal note from Tokyo, there has been no news.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 28th Dispatch: Japanese newspapers in Tokyo warned today that if the transport of goods by the United States to Vladivostok causes any consequences, the United States must bear full responsibility. The Hochi Shimbun endorsed the government sending notes to the United States and the Soviet Union, stating that it was easy to imagine how the United States would respond to Japan's note. The paper stated that if the American action caused any consequences, the United States should bear full responsibility. It further stated that whether Japan can break through the encirclement of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union depends on the solidarity of the nation and how it strengthens its efforts with the German-Italian axis. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the U.S. and Soviet authorities may believe that Japan, as a signatory to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, should not protest the transport by ships of the non-belligerent United States. However, the U.S. and Soviet countries should know that the United States' transport of military aircraft and gasoline through Japan to unknown locations is an insult to Japan. It added that this matter is not only about oil tankers but also has a great bearing on Japan's entire foreign policy. Japan cannot continue to endure this under the tense international situation.</p>
<p>Japan's Imminent Crisis Has Reached Its Most Serious Stage</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th Dispatch: Mutō of the Hochi Shimbun wrote today that the imminent crisis faced by Japan has reached its most serious stage. Therefore, the whole country hopes that the government will show courage. Mutō urged the government to demonstrate this courage by unhesitatingly advancing diplomatic offensives while there is still room for a peaceful solution. However, if this is not the case, then Japan should act quickly, because wasting time has a hundred disadvantages and not a single benefit. He said that the government should make a decision. "We are neither pro-British nor pro-American, nor are we the fifth column of Germany. Frankly speaking,</p>
<p>we are the fifth column of Japan. What we most hope for is the welfare of Japan."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 28th Dispatch: The Japanese Jiji Shimpō published in its afternoon edition today a translation of an article from this morning's Hochi Shimbun, stating that there is still room for diplomatic negotiations between Japan and the United States. The Hochi Shimbun article was written by the famous commentator Komuro. He said that the Pacific crisis has the possibility of negotiation because the United States and Britain would never welcome Japan jumping on the springboard. However, he warned Japan that in these negotiations, it must not adopt a "gap-filling" policy but should adopt a firm stance to reject the "maximum demands" of Britain and the United States. Komuro also said that if American oil tankers transport oil and munitions to Vladivostok, it is a direct challenge to Japan. He added that the United States' forceful interpretation of freedom of the seas, even if recognized in the eastern half of the Pacific, cannot be recognized in the western half.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Australian Parliament Adjourns Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<h3 id="e6">Rumors of a Seven-Power Pact Established by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; London Speculates on Japan's Future Policy; Believes the Nature of the Tokyo Cabinet Meeting Is Quite Important <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 28th Dispatch: According to London dispatches, Londoners believe that the recent cabinet meeting in Tokyo was quite important in nature. The discussions at the meeting must have been extremely intense to determine whether Japan should reach an understanding with Britain and the United States or whether it should come into conflict with Britain and the United States. It is believed here that the United States' attempt to reach a compromise with Japan has not been reciprocated in Japan, so pressure on Japan will continue to intensify. According to the Washington correspondent of the London Daily Mail, U.S. pressure on Japan has greatly increased in the past few days, and a seven-power pact has been established to jointly resist Japan. The seven powers refer to China, Britain, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. The purpose of the pact is that when Japan makes a risky new attempt, the seven powers will act in concert to destroy Japan. Whether Japan advances south or north may be the reason for the initiation of the joint action without distinction. This policy was decided at the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. The United States' dispatch of a military mission to China is sufficient to prove the existence of the agreement. The London Times believes that the possibility of a U.S.-Japan rapprochement is extremely small. It is generally hoped that Churchill's speech will make Japanese politicians understand the dangers of Japan's aggressive actions, but this hope has apparently been difficult to achieve. No one believes that Japan is prepared to cooperate. The possibility of Japan changing its policy is very slight. Japan's hope to improve its relations with the United States is only a delaying tactic, as Japan intends to act in concert when Germany has achieved complete victory in the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Anglo-Soviet Advance and the Iranian Question <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Anglo-Soviet entry into Iran has lasted four days. It is reported that Iran has requested a cessation of military operations, conditioned on the expulsion of Germans within its borders. Whether it can be resolved smoothly and quickly is unknown, but it can be asserted that this move by Britain and the Soviet Union has eliminated a major hidden concern for the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>Since the Nazi invasion of Britain failed, they have turned to trying to cut off the limbs of the British Empire, with the Near East being the most important target. Last autumn, German forces rapidly expanded southeast along the Danube, encompassing Romania and occupying Southern Greece. At the same time, they also sent large forces across the Mediterranean to reinforce North Africa, forcing British forces back to within the Egyptian border. Strategically, they had arranged the two wings of a pincer movement. However, they did not immediately follow a set formula for attack but prepared to open up an eastward route from Turkey and Ukraine, taking the necessary measures near Asia Minor. If this move were successful, British forces in the Near East, even if they were not in dire straits, would find it extremely difficult to cope with. Therefore, the two proactive offensives launched by British forces in Iraq and Syria were wise and timely measures that at least eliminated a part of the crisis in the Near East. However, Iran remained a major weak point because the estrangement between Britain and the Soviet Union had not yet been resolved. The long and deep relations between the Soviet Union and Iran made it impossible for Britain to avoid some misgivings. This period of hesitation also gave the Nazis the opportunity to intensify their activities in Iran.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Soviet-German war had various objectives on the Nazi side, but undoubtedly one of its important ambitions was to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and the Near East and further cut off the shortest transportation route between the British mainland and India and Australia. Recent Soviet-German battles have focused on the southern route. Although there are still more than a thousand miles and the natural barrier of the Caucasus Mountains separating the Dnipro River from the Caucasus and the Near East, it cannot be denied that these two areas are under considerable threat. If the situation in Iran changes, not only will the oil sources of Britain and the Soviet Union be in danger of being destroyed, but the British forces in the Near East and the Soviet forces fighting hard in southern Russia will also be in danger of being attacked from both sides. This is undoubtedly the intention behind the Nazis' recent efforts to deploy forces in Iran over the past month.</p>
<p>Iran is geographically the key route to India, controlling traffic through the "Aerial Suez"—the Persian Gulf. It is also an important source of oil for Britain. Therefore, Britain naturally attaches extreme importance to the importance of British-Iranian relations, while Iran is constantly seeking to recover its oil sources and get rid of British control. As for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Iran, it has historically been similar to the situation between Britain and Iran. After the Russian Revolution, it abandoned some privileges in Iran and supported its national revolutionary movement. However, in the eyes of the Iranian authorities, it has always been an obstacle to the future development of Iran, just like Britain. Iran, situated between two major powers, therefore wanted to introduce a third force to check Britain and the Soviet Union. The granting of oil exploration rights in the east to the United States and the hiring of American advisors to reorganize its finances were concrete manifestations of this policy. The Nazi forces then took advantage of this gap to invade Iran. The successors to the American financial advisors were two Germans. The engineers hired locally were mainly Germans. For ten years, German economic power in Iran has been constantly expanding, and by taking advantage of British-Iranian economic disputes to sow discord, it has extensively created the foundation for a fifth column. In recent months, the Nazis, in coordination with their military ambitions, have sent a large number of personnel to infiltrate Iran. There have been constant warnings, but the Iranian government has remained indifferent after repeated warnings from Britain and the Soviet Union. If this is not, as the recent telegraph reported, because the Iranian government has not fully recognized the danger of this situation, it must be because the Iranian authorities have been held hostage by German personnel and do not have sufficient freedom to respond decisively.</p>
<p>But this issue is not only related to the Near East and the Caucasus. If the Nazi conspiracy were to succeed in Iran, it would certainly develop into an even greater crisis. The theory that "the road to London must pass through Delhi (the capital of India)" is certainly well-known to the Nazis. On the other hand, Thailand is by no means the end point of Japan's southward advance. The convergence of the two major violent forces in the East and West may be realized by focusing on the Iranian issue. Therefore, this decisive proactive measure by Britain and the Soviet Union is of great significance to both Asia and Europe. When the Soviet-German war had just broken out, the British government transferred General Wavell, who was then using troops in Syria, to be the commander-in-chief of the Indian army. This intention caused some people to suspect, and some in the British Parliament even criticized it as unnecessary. However, now one cannot help but admire the foresight of the British authorities: In order to prevent the convergence of Eastern and Western violence, a capable and steady commander is needed in India. Moreover, Wavell is well-versed in Soviet affairs, and is the most suitable person to carry out joint Anglo-Soviet operations in the Near East.</p>
<p>Even if the Iranian government has been taken hostage by the Nazis, the Iranian people have no deep hatred towards Britain and the Soviet Union, and will not shoulder the task of hindering the Anglo-Soviet forces for the sake of the invaders' interests. Therefore, whether the ceasefire requested by Iran can be quickly realized is still up in the air. But with Anglo-Soviet forces surrounding from all sides, this situation can be clarified early. At that time, not only will the danger of Nazi eastward advances be lessened, but the transport of American war material to the Soviet Union can also open up another safe and convenient route in the Persian Gulf, and Turkey, which is in a state of flux, will regain stability, so that the Near East will no longer be threatened by aggression. If military cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union can be quickly developed with the Iranian incident as a starting point, it will certainly be able to exert a significant effect and shorten the process of defeating the Nazis. The future of the anti-aggression war is bright.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Anti-Soviet Volunteer Army in Versailles Laval and Déat Assassinated Three Other Officers and Police Officers Injured Young Assassin Collet Arrested on the Spot <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, 27th Dispatch, Versailles Former French Cabinet Minister Laval was attending a flag-awarding ceremony for the Anti-Soviet Volunteer Army here today when a thug opened fire on him several times. Laval immediately fell to the ground wounded. Déat, leader of the pro-German group rally movement and editor of the "Affaires" newspaper, and Ditteroya, director of the Versailles barracks quartermaster depot, were also injured and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Among them, Laval was the most seriously injured, having been shot twice, once in the right arm and once below the heart. Doctors refused to announce whether he would be out of danger within the day, only saying that Laval's injuries looked promising. The assassin was arrested on the spot. According to his confession, he was born in 1912 in Calvados and had participated in assassination groups. He said that at 5:50 PM today, when Laval was surrounded by people, he was forced to open fire.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 28th Dispatch, Paris French Interior Minister Pucheu went from Paris to Versailles last night to console Laval and Déat.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 18th Dispatch, Versailles Pro-German leader Déat was shot in the abdomen and underwent surgery last night. According to the surgeon, although the surgery went well, the patient was weak and complications might arise, so his life was in danger. If there is no change in Laval's condition within three days, he will be out of danger. As for the assassin Collet, he was interrogated all night by German police officers and French officials last night. According to his confession, he belongs to the Tergull group and will be tried by a special court. The police authorities have launched a major search for accomplices. According to the Petit Parisien, three people have been arrested, one of whom is named Terrier, who arrived from Marseille a month ago.</p>
<p>Reuters, 28th Dispatch, Berlin This morning, hospital authorities reported that the seriousness of Laval's injuries exceeded the diagnosis when he was first sent to the hospital. According to a dispatch from Paris, Laval was shot twice, once below the heart and once in the liver. Dr. Sulini, director of the German military hospital in Germany, has sent two of the most skilled surgeons to Versailles Hospital to assist French doctors.</p>
<p>Details of the Shooting of Laval and Others</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 28th Dispatch, Paris Former French Prime Minister Laval was assassinated in Versailles at around 6:00 PM last night. At that time, a member of the Communist Party opened fire, seriously wounding Laval. Former Aviation Minister Déat was also slightly injured. After Laval was injured, surgery was performed immediately. His condition was very serious last night. The assassin was almost beaten by the crowd. He will be tried by a special court today and will likely be sentenced to death according to current criminal law. Laval was assassinated at the Porgnès Barracks in Versailles, where the French Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps is stationed. At 5:30 PM yesterday, the flag-raising ceremony was held in the parade ground. French Occupied Zone Liaison Ambassador Brinon, Laval, Déat, and other dignitaries were present. Representatives of the German Embassy and the German Army also attended. The Blue Shirt Team of the National Movement and the Anti-Communist People's Party lined up in front of the barracks. A unit of the Republican Guard and a military band played music to salute Brinon upon his arrival. The crowd also gathered. After the French flag was raised, the crowd cheered and sang the French national anthem. After inspecting the barracks, Brinon gave a radio speech, stating that the conscription of volunteers was the beginning of a great development. When Brinon and others left the barracks, a young man jumped out of the crowd and fired several shots. Laval was walking with Brinon and Déat and was shot several times. Déat was also shot once. Many others were injured. The police arrested a red-haired youth. The crowd shouted "Hang the assassin" and "Kill the assassin." The police escorted the assassin away. Laval was taken to Versailles Hospital by car and underwent surgery immediately, removing three bullets. Déat was also sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>The Assassin Confesses His Determination to Assassinate</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 28th Dispatch, Vichy Regarding the assassination of former French Prime Minister Laval and former Air Force Minister Déat yesterday in Versailles, it is now known that both were shot and injured, but not fatally. The incident occurred after the ceremony to send off the first contingent of volunteers to fight against the Soviet Union. The assassin has been arrested. According to his confession, his name is Paul Collet, 29 years old, born on August 12, 1912, in Calvados, and currently residing in Caen. I came to Versailles to enlist as a volunteer. I was determined to shoot one or two people. When I saw Laval on the scene, I shot him.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 28th Dispatch, Paris When Laval and others left the barracks of the French Legion, they were shot at by the assassin Collet, who fired five shots. After Laval was injured, he was supported by the police and friends. He was shot once in the right chest. He was immediately sent to Versailles Hospital, where he regained consciousness and was in good spirits. The other injured were also sent to the hospital one after another. Déat was shot once, the bullet passing between his heart and liver. A French Legion colonel was injured in the arm. A police officer was injured in the left leg, and another youth was injured in the arm. Laval was only given local anesthesia during the surgery. The first bullet grazed his right arm, injuring his right hand. The second bullet pierced his chest near his heart. Laval will be hospitalized for two or three days.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 27th Dispatch, Clermont-Ferrand After Laval was assassinated in Versailles this afternoon and sent to the hospital for treatment, he personally used the telephone in the hospital to call his wife and daughter, Countess Chamberlain, to report on his injuries. Laval's wife and daughter, who currently reside in the Chateldon villa in the free zone of France, immediately rushed to Paris in order to travel to Versailles to visit him.</p>
<p>French Intensify Suppression of Communists</p>
<p>United Press, 28th Dispatch, Vichy Former French Prime Minister Laval and "Paris Worker's Newspaper" editor Déat (both of whom are the most reactionary in the Pétain cabinet) are recovering in a hospital in Versailles after being assassinated there last night. Another Colonel Doife, whose injuries are not serious, is also in the hospital. The "Paris Worker's Newspaper" is a German-controlled newspaper, and Déat is considered to be the most outspoken anti-Pétain figure among the pro-Germans. Colonel Doife is a member of the Paris National Rally Party, which is also run by Germans and known for its anti-Pétain stance. Déat is also a member of this party. It is widely believed that this incident will trigger large-scale German retaliation, as the Nazis have previously ordered that anti-Nazi and anti-Vichy saboteurs will be severely punished. Since the Germans in Paris issued a warning that Germans must not be harmed, or else French hostages will be taken in compensation, this riot is still only preliminary. According to reliable sources, Laval has received numerous threatening letters since the outbreak of the war between the Soviet Union and Germany. The French government learned of the assassination incident at 8:30 PM last night through a phone call. It immediately accepted the challenge from the Communist Party, and French Interior Minister Pucheu and French Ambassador to Paris Brinon ordered the intensification of the suppression of the Communist Party. At the same time, Justice Minister Barthélemy arrived from Paris, where he had organized a special court for counter-terrorism and anti-communism.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Soviet Troops Launch Full-Scale Counteroffensive on Lower Dnieper River; German Casualties in This Campaign Reach 80,000; Germans Occupy Velikiye Luki on Northern Front <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, 28th (United Press) - A Soviet communiqué reported yesterday that fierce battles took place along the entire Soviet-German front yesterday. The communiqué stated, "Our troops are engaged with the enemy on all fronts." Other Soviet reports mention a major battle near Gomel, claiming heavy German losses.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (United Press) - General Berezovski reported to the General Headquarters here yesterday that German casualties in the Gomel campaign amounted to 80,000, with the loss of 200 tanks and hundreds of artillery pieces and aircraft. It is now known that the highway to Leningrad continues to suffer large-scale bombing by the German air force. Moscow has not heard air raid sirens for eight nights. Moscow Radio claims that Nazi air raids on Leningrad were thwarted, with over 100 German aircraft shot down.</p>
<p>Vichy, 28th (Reuters) - The Vichy News Agency reported last night from Hungary that Soviet troops on the lower Dnieper front are launching a counteroffensive "with all their might." So far, they have been repelled.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) - Yesterday, German radio announced the occupation of Velikiye Luki on the Riga-Moscow railway, capturing many prisoners and seizing 400 artillery pieces. Velikiye Luki is the meeting point for two Soviet armies led by Generals Voroshilov and Timoshenko. The Germans naturally intend to drive a wedge here. Soviet communiqués speak of fierce fighting along the entire front, but do not specifically mention any location. It must be admitted that the vagueness of Soviet communiqués is causing some degree of anxiety, as it gives the Germans an opportunity to boast of their gains. Fortunately, German claims have repeatedly proven to be exaggerations and are therefore not to be taken lightly. There have been no further reports on the fighting around Leningrad or the Soviet counteroffensive in the Gomel area. Well-informed sources in London seem to view the Soviet counteroffensive, believing the Gomel counteroffensive will be decisive in the outcome of the salient around Kyiv. This area is also very close to the meeting point of the left flank of General Timoshenko's forces and the right flank of General Budyonny's forces. The German blitzkrieg tactics have failed, and the war of attrition has not yielded significant results. They are now clearly trying to separate the three Soviet armies and attack them individually when the opportunity is best. If the Germans can maintain the initiative, this tactic is quite threatening, but the Soviet generals will certainly have a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>British Report: Red Army Recaptures Gomel, Achieves Major Victory West of Dnieper River</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (International News Service) - The Soviet High Command announced today that Soviet troops achieved a major victory west of the Dnieper River, killing over 6,000 German soldiers. Soviet troops on the central front continue their relentless offensive. Red Star reported today that in the Gomel area, the Germans have already lost 80,000 soldiers and 200 tanks. Fierce fighting is ongoing in the areas around Kingisepp, Smolensk, and Odesa. The London Daily Mail reported today, citing news from the Swedish capital, that Soviet troops on the central front have captured Gomel. A Reuters dispatch from Vichy states that Soviet troops are launching a fierce counteroffensive on the east bank of the Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Leningrad's Defenses Tight, German Advance Unlikely to Succeed</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Reuters) - A visitor from Leningrad spoke of the tense atmosphere in the city. It is said that every building in Leningrad resembles a fortress, with fire lookouts on the rooftops, watching day and night. Factories are working overtime, and the work left behind by men going to the front is mostly being taken over by women. All residents of the city share the strong desire to "go to the front and fight for victory." The situation on the streets is different from the past. Sandbags are piled in front of store windows, and troops are continuously moving to the front. Red Cross nurses in blue uniforms are everywhere. The city is clearly trying to defend itself with the most modern methods. Inside and around the city, like Moscow, anti-aircraft batteries are deployed and quite active, dealing a heavy blow to the Germans. In the past two days, 101 German aircraft have been shot down. The Soviet army is determined to defend Leningrad to the end, so they will fight fiercely for every inch of ground. The progress of the invading German army has slowed. The entire Soviet Union is now watching Leningrad, and defending the city has become a matter of personal honor for every citizen. The biggest problem for Leningrad is maintaining transportation and supply lines to Moscow and Vologda. Judging from the current situation, the Germans are finding it difficult to advance along that treacherous area and dare not get too close to the Moscow-Leningrad railway. The Germans probably won't try to cut the railway until they get closer to Leningrad, because in terms of moving heavy equipment, the situation is extremely unfavorable for the Germans, especially during the continuous rain. The Germans' long supply lines will become even more dangerous. Moscow feels that General Voroshilov's prediction that Leningrad will never fall into enemy hands is not a boast, but perhaps the prelude to the most glorious battle in this war. There are clearly large Soviet forces in the Leningrad area, as well as civilians helping to defend it, and supplies are quite sufficient. From this perspective, it will be difficult for the Germans to transfer enough fresh troops from the distant rear to break through Leningrad's defenses. Judging from the fighting elsewhere on the front, the major offensive launched by the Germans two weeks ago seems to be gradually weakening. It will take time to prepare for another offensive, but delaying will be disadvantageous to the Germans, especially in the northern and central sectors. The Germans in the south did succeed in crossing the lower Dnieper River, but they have now been stopped on the riverbank. The German pincer movement against Ukraine, with its left wing advancing from Gomel, attempting to directly threaten Bryansk, Kharkiv, and the Don River basin, has been repelled by the Soviet counteroffensive in the Gomel area. This battle is also quite important. German claims of occupying Dnipropetrovsk have not yet been confirmed by the Soviets. The German advance on Kyiv was dealt a major blow a few days ago and has not succeeded. The Black Sea port of Odesa is still firmly held by Soviet troops, causing considerable anxiety to the German flank in western Ukraine.</p>
<p>Estonian Capital Tallinn Reportedly Destroyed by Retreating Red Army</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (United Press) - Sources here say that the German army, which will soon be able to enter Tallinn from the southeast, will find that the most beautiful city on the Baltic coast has been reduced to ashes and smoke, because yesterday, people clearly saw the sky above this Estonian capital ablaze with fire. At first, people thought that only ships and the harbor were on fire, but today it is confirmed here that the entire city has been sacrificed due to the Soviet scorched earth policy. News from Helsinki says that the glow of the fire in the city can still be seen 50 miles away in the Gulf of Finland.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Iran Indicates Submission, Willing to Expel Germans; This Step Inevitably Comes Too Late, British and Soviet Union Temporarily Unable to Halt Military Operations <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the British and Soviet forces entering Iran from the north and south have encountered very weak resistance from the Iranian army, and the people in the areas they have passed through are very harmonious with the Allied forces. The Tehran authorities now understand that the result of their stalling policy is to put Iran in a grave and dangerous situation. The Iranian government challenged the massive Allied forces with a lightning strike, and despite very earnest warnings from the British and Soviets, it still did not take serious action to prevent the infiltration of German agents or reduce the number of German agents in the country. Now that the British and Soviet strikes have arrived, the Iranian government seems to have changed its attitude and put forward new proposals of a broader nature. It is widely believed that the Shah has informed British Minister Sir Reader Bullard that the Iranian government is willing to expel all Germans within a week, with only a small number of indispensable German technicians being temporarily retained, and dismissed as soon as replacements are trained. However, the British and Soviet governments are now taking steps to eliminate the German fifth column. This Iranian government proposal inevitably comes too late. Undoubtedly, the British and Soviets will give great consideration to the Iranian government's proposal, but unless the potential threat of the Axis powers in Iran is completely eliminated, the military operations that have already been launched cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Reuters) - Information on the progress of Soviet troops in Iran remains scarce, but judging from the place names mentioned in the Soviet communiqués, the Soviet advance is quite rapid and has met with no resistance. Judging by the speed of the Soviet advance into Iran, the majority of it is clearly motorized troops. The Soviet press emphasizes that the Soviet Union has no ill feelings towards the Iranian people. Pravda published an article stating that Iranian society is still feudal in nature, with landlords charging exorbitant rents, and that the fascist officers in the Iranian army are all influenced by Hitler.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) - The British-Indian forces entering Iran are commanded by Lieutenant General Quinan. Quinan has fought in Egypt, France, Iraq, and on the Northwest Frontier, and has been wounded twice.</p>
<p>More British Troops Land in Iran</p>
<p>Simla, 28th (Reuters) - This morning's latest communiqué from here stated that the activities of British troops in southern Iran have completely cleared Khorramshahr, and Abadan is completely pacified. The residents seem to welcome the arrival of the British troops. British gunboats are now sailing up the Karun River because British citizens in Bandar Mashur (about eight miles northeast of Bandar Shahpur) are in danger of being detained. More British troops have landed in Bandar Shahpur. In the northern sector, the southern force that set out from Qazvin yesterday advanced along the only narrow road to Shahabad, occupying the town and Alabad, 15 miles along the road. The British army drove out 2,000 Iranian troops from the heights in Qazvin. The road has been obstructed and equipped with flat-trajectory guns.</p>
<p>Red Army Enters Iran, Occupies Four More Cities</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (TASS) - Soviet troops who entered Iran on the 27th have occupied the four cities of Dehkhargan, Torkmanchai, Kilkanlode, and Guchesan and are continuing to advance.</p>
<p>Iranian Cabinet Already Reorganized</p>
<p>New York, 28th (Reuters) - The American National Broadcasting Company's dispatch from Ankara states that according to an announcement by an Iranian spokesperson in Ankara, the Iranian cabinet resigned yesterday.</p>
<p>Ankara, 28th (Havas) - According to a dispatch from the Iranian capital received here, a new cabinet has been formed in the country, with Foroughi as prime minister, who served as prime minister from 1932 to 1935, and Ghiai as foreign minister. The new cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning, deciding to stop resisting British and Soviet forces to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, and intending to send representatives to negotiate with British and Soviet representatives.</p>
<p>Iranian Crisis About to Be Resolved</p>
<p>Ankara, 28th (United Press) - Diplomatic sources today believe that as a result of whirlwind diplomacy, the Iranian situation is about to have a compromise resolution. At 7:30 PM yesterday, Turkish President Inonu had a long meeting with British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen. Before that, Turkish Foreign Minister Dr. Saracoglu met with the envoys of Iran, Britain, the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Afghanistan. It is reported that the Iranian ambassador told the Turkish Foreign Minister that after a long meeting in the Iranian cabinet and nearly uninterrupted talks between the Shah in Tehran and British and Soviet envoys, the Iranian government has decided to seek a compromise. An Iranian diplomatic source told the United Press last night that Iran does not wish to prolong the war. Military observers say that the most important military strongholds in Iran have already been occupied by British and Soviet forces and that there is practically no resistance. Therefore, from the perspective of military activities, the Iranian war can be considered to be over.</p>
<p>Cairo, 28th (Reuters) - According to reports received here, military operations in Iran are not only proceeding smoothly, but also at a very high speed, and are likely to end soon. The British army is making excellent use of airborne troops. With the rapid advance of Soviet troops from the north, it is feared that German individuals attempting to escape to Turkey through various dangerous mountain passes will have difficulty escaping. The reasons for the Allied action in Iran have been fully explained to Turkish officials on numerous occasions, and Turkey is therefore paying close attention to this matter, which has close ties to them.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Two American Bank Executives Travel to Hong Kong to Attend Stabilization Meeting; Dr. Taylor Departed the Day Before; Western Newspapers Offer Opinions on Managing Shanghai Exchange Rates <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Hawkins, General Manager of the British-owned Mercantile Bank of India, London and China (MBI), and Chairman of the Foreign Bankers' Association, and Mr. MacKay, General Manager of the American-owned National City Bank of New York (Citibank), left for Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Kiangsu steamer last night, having been summoned by the Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to attend the second plenary meeting of the Stabilization Committee. The ship is scheduled to leave port and sail south at 6:00 AM this morning. Dr. Taylor, the American advisor to the Stabilization Committee stationed in Shanghai, had previously left for Hong Kong on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yue Sang steamer at around 1:00 PM the day before. Mr. Holborn, the British representative, did not accompany him due to urgent matters to be dealt with at the British Embassy.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor Departs Ahead of Time</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, in order to discuss the entire Shanghai foreign exchange problem, has decided to hold its second plenary meeting in Hong Kong. Chairman Chen Guangfu, Chinese representatives Sidney Barton and Fox, and American representative Fox have all flown to Hong Kong from Chongqing one after another. At the same time, they urgently telegraphed Dr. Taylor, the American advisor stationed in Shanghai, and the managers of the Mercantile and Citibank banks, urging them to quickly go to Hong Kong to participate in the meeting. Dr. Taylor, residing in the Capital Hotel, was originally scheduled to leave for Hong Kong on the 26th, but due to shipping issues, he delayed until the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 27th) to travel on the Yue Sang steamer. Mr. Taylor will return to Shanghai after the meeting concludes.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Participate in Meeting</p>
<p>As for the managers of Mercantile and Citibank, Mr. Hawkins and Mr. MacKay, due to insufficient preparation, were unable to travel with Mr. Taylor and therefore delayed their departure until last night, traveling on the Taikoo Kiangsu steamer. The ship is scheduled to leave port at 6:00 AM this morning. Mr. Hawkins, as Chairman of the Shanghai Foreign Bankers' Association, naturally represents the interests of foreign banks in Shanghai. This time, accompanied by Citibank manager Mr. MacKay, he will express the attitude and intentions of Shanghai foreign banks on the issue of Shanghai exchange rate management at the Stabilization Committee meeting.</p>
<p>Four Principles Said to Be Discussed</p>
<p>There are four important factors at this meeting: (1) How to strengthen the close connection between Chinese, British, and American finance through the adjustment work of the Stabilization Committee. (2) How to replenish the Stabilization Fund to provide the necessary foreign exchange for importing essential goods at any time. (3) How to intensify the freezing of Chinese funds by the British and Americans to prevent domestic and foreign funds from fleeing abroad. (4) How to promote cooperation measures between China, Britain, and the United States to eliminate the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai. The meeting date is roughly scheduled for the first of next month.</p>
<p>Three Steps to Manage Shanghai Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Yesterday's edition of the English-language Finance &amp; Commerce Weekly stated that it has conducted a detailed review of the changes in the exchange market over the past ten days and made the following comments on future trends. Dr. Taylor, advisor to American representative Mr. Fox, is now in Shanghai, planning the work of the Stabilization Committee. Although Mr. Taylor himself is not a member of the Stabilization Committee, he has done everything in his power to ensure that the financial institution has satisfactory work. Mr. Holborn, who was recently appointed as a member of the Stabilization Fund Committee, has arrived in Shanghai. He may obtain the necessary authority to make immediate decisions, or else a small Shanghai sub-committee should be established and granted sufficient authority to avoid having to report everything to Hong Kong, which would cause delays. This is the first step. The second step is to clarify the list of various major imported goods and allow them to be supplied at the new exchange rate. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Council's import of rice through Hong Kong or Burma is one such major import. The third step is to immediately resolve the small problems that are of concern to the general public, such as paying insurance premiums, because overseas insurance premiums must be paid in foreign exchange. These issues may seem trivial to the members of the Stabilization Fund Committee, but they are actually related to the interests of thousands of salaried people. Therefore, the official exchange rate should not only be considered for the benefit of the business community, otherwise the general public will not benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Labor and Management of British-Owned Public Buses Continue Negotiations <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The drivers and mechanics of the British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Co. held a general meeting yesterday morning. Representatives first reported on past negotiations with the company and solicited opinions from the workers on resuming work first. The workers felt that the principles had not been thoroughly resolved and insisted on resuming work after a settlement was reached, and elected fifteen representatives, including Zhang Aqing, to negotiate with the company again. As for the company, it held a board meeting at noon yesterday to discuss the workers' strike and decided to have the Associate, together with the factory manager and the general manager of the vehicle and mechanical departments, discuss and resolve the matter with the workers' representatives. At 2:00 PM yesterday, labor and management negotiated at the company's office, discussing and resolving the matter. Workers' representatives Zhang Aqing, Sun Yunlong, Chen Yongda, etc., and company Associate Mr. Fells, Factory Manager Wadek, etc., raised and discussed each of the seven demands. Both labor and management are willing to negotiate openly and honestly, and it has been decided to continue negotiating the demands today. However, it is reported that at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Mr. Schormann, a German Jewish ticket inspector of the company, was surrounded and beaten by a crowd of striking workers in the company on Connaught Road after having an argument with them, and was stabbed with a sharp blade, suffering four knife wounds and bleeding profusely. Afterwards, police officers dispersed the crowd and summoned a car to take Mr. Schormann to the hospital for treatment. Mr. Schormann is still receiving treatment at the Country Hospital (仁濟醫院).</p>
<h3 id="e25">Situation in Suzhou Creek Area Returns to Normal; Japanese Soldiers Still Conduct Searches of Pedestrians and Vehicles <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that after two people were assassinated in the Hongkou district on Monday night, the Japanese naval landing force strictly searched vehicles and pedestrians on all bridges over the Suzhou Creek. The assassinations on Monday night occurred at the intersection of Seymour Road and Seward Road. The reporter patrolled the area for a week yesterday (the 27th) and saw that pedestrians were bustling and that, except for a Japanese guard, the situation had returned to normal.</p>
<p>Lined Up for Inspection</p>
<p>However, Chinese and foreign residents who want to enter Hongkou have been greatly affected by these assassinations. When crossing the Garden Bridge, they must line up and be searched one by one by Japanese guards, and their epidemic prevention certificates must be inspected. Some have to stand for more than half an hour before being allowed to cross the bridge. Chinese women are also searched. Foreigners only need to show their epidemic prevention certificates.</p>
<p>Street Scene Appears Peaceful</p>
<p>The reporter walked north across the Garden Bridge yesterday and entered the main part of Hongkou and saw no abnormal scenes. Residents lived as usual. All signs of Monday night's assassinations had disappeared. No Japanese guards or patrols were seen. Walking west along the Hongkou Creek to Fearon Road, there was no sign of military activity except for Japanese guards on the bridges. Sampans were moored in the creek, and the occasional hawker broke the silence by peddling along the street.</p>
<p>Deployments Also in the City Center</p>
<p>There was also no military activity along Sichuan Road near the Japanese naval landing force barracks, but the situation changed abruptly upon reaching Jiangwan Road. Iron barbed wire and defensive shelters have been erected on the railway line and on the left side of Jiangwan Road, indicating that there are also military deployments in the city center. There are also such buildings along Lange Road Creek. Two bridges on the creek have been closed, and traffic on other bridges is cut off from 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Ward Road Bridge Closed</p>
<p>The Ward Road Bridge is also closed from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. The Hoongkew Road Bridge and the Canton Road Bridge have been completely blocked by barbed wire, completely cutting off traffic. It is currently unknown whether these actions by the Japanese are due to the recent assassinations or for other political reasons. However, most people believe that the Japanese closure of the bridges in the Yangtzepoo district is a military precaution to prevent the recurrence of assassinations.</p>
<p>Japanese Deny Assassinations</p>
<p>At the same time, Japanese army spokesman Akiyama yesterday firmly denied that a senior Japanese officer on Dixwell Road was shot and killed by a Japanese soldier, but rumors of such an incident are still rampant and have not yet been confirmed from any source. As for when the searches of pedestrians and vehicles entering Hongkou will end, it is still difficult to obtain information. It is said that the search may continue until the end of the week or even the beginning of next week. However, there is a possibility that the situation will improve significantly in the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>Since the seven coal ball factories withdrew from the association and increased their selling prices, the attention of the concession authorities has been drawn deeply. It is now heard that the nine factories of Yi Tai Hsing, Nan Yang, Kuo Hua, Tung Fang, Kuang Hua, Hua Tung, Chung Kuo, Yue Tung, Jing Hua etc. have jointly submitted a petition to the two concession authorities to organize an evaluation committee, in order to avoid disputes. The petition reads, "Petition for the organization of Shanghai Two Concessions Coal Ball Evaluation Committee, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain fuel. The coal balls manufactured by the factories have become one of the fuels for the masses in this city. Because of increased costs and changes in selling prices, it often causes criticism and is difficult to gain sympathy. In order to avoid disputes and reveal the facts publicly, we hereby petition your bureaux to initiate the organization of an evaluation committee. The two concession authorities will convene various authorities related to coal ball factories: (1) Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. Hong Kong Head Office Shanghai Office (2nd Floor, Asiatic Petroleum Building, No. 9 The Bund), (2) Hong Kee Coal Dust Import Company French firm Paulot et Bader (No. 39 Avenue Edward VII), (3) Couvreur Coal Dust Import Company Chee Cheng &amp; Co. (No. 22 Rue Maresca), each will send a representative to jointly organize. In the future, matters related to the selling price of coal balls will be handled in accordance with the wishes of the committee. The factories will sincerely accept the order under reasonable supervision. If you need to inquire about factory affairs, the factory will also send representatives to attend and provide sincere information for reference. The matter can be revealed to the public, and can also be laid to a firm decision. The matters relates to the factory, therefore, we are bold enough to state the facts. We respectfully await your instructions."</p>

<h3 id="e28">Three Banks Ordered to Collect Principal and Interest on Rehabilitation Bonds <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The eleventh principal repayment of the Rehabilitation Public Bonds of the Republic of China Year 25 (1936) was drawn in Shanghai on July 10 by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. All bonds drawn and matured interest totaled 2.72 million yuan for principal repayment and 9.69 million yuan for interest payment, for a total of 12.41 million yuan. From the 31st, the Central Bank and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications entrusted by it will handle payments. The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have recently received telegrams from the head office regarding the payment of principal and interest due for this period on the Rehabilitation Public Bonds. The Chongqing head office will make payments in six installments, one month for each installment, to be paid in full by the end of January of the 31st year (1942). However, in order to facilitate bondholders in Shanghai, the Shanghai branches of the three banks are specially authorized to collect drawn bond certificates and matured interest coupons and forward them to the Chongqing head office for collection, and to waive the remittance fee from Chongqing to Shanghai. Bondholders who wish to entrust the Shanghai branches of the three banks to collect on their behalf should obtain blank forms from the three banks, fill them out themselves, and attach the drawn bond certificates and current interest coupons. After verification, a temporary receipt will be issued, and the official receipt will be exchanged after the first installment of principal and interest arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Since the end of last week, there has been another shortage of small denomination coins in the market. Retail businesses have found it very inconvenient to make change. Logically speaking, there should be no shortage. It is reported that the Bank Association has approved its members to exchange their stockpiled five-cent aluminum coins. The Central Bank will also issue and redeem as many of the previously printed fractional currency notes as possible. Therefore, the shortage in the market should be alleviated. It is hoped that citizens will not alarm each other.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Driven by Life's Hardships: Drowning of Own Infant; Already Suffering from Poverty, Why Resign and Live Idly?; Defendant Claims to Suffer from Mental Illness Awaiting Examination; Boiling an Infant in a Pot on Wasteland: A Horrifying Story <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Gao Xiaofu, a native of Suzhou, is 35 years old and lives at 127 Xiaoshadu Road. He was a cook at the home of a Westerner named Molalin at the Shanghai Power Company at 106 Room 3 nearby, earning 110 yuan per month. Nine years ago, he met a woman named Shi Xuebao, and they soon began cohabiting. A year later, they had a daughter named Peidi, who is now eight years old. Then they had a son named Yaosheng, who is six years old. Last November, Shi gave birth to a son named Guisheng. However, Gao felt that the rising prices in recent years and the meager salary made it difficult to support his three children. Therefore, he discussed with Shi the possibility of giving Guisheng, who was only eight months old, away to someone else. However, Shi did not agree, leading to frequent arguments. On June 6th of this year, Gao suddenly resigned from his job and lay in bed all day, trying to find a solution. He decided to get rid of Guisheng so that the other two children could be taken care of. So, on June 7th, while Shi was out buying groceries, he took a lead bucket, filled it with clean water, and placed Guisheng upside down in the bucket, covering it with a stool. Then he went out.</p>
<p>His whereabouts were unknown. When Shi returned home with the groceries, she discovered the situation and quickly rescued the child. However, because too much time had passed, resuscitation was unsuccessful. She reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to the autopsy room to examine the body. The body was identified and taken away for burial. Gao Xiaofu, after murdering his own son, fled to Suzhou. He returned to Shanghai on July 29th and resumed working at the Westerner's house on Xiaoshadu Road on August 25th. The police learned of this, went and arrested Gao and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, detailed the above situation and questioned the defendant: "Since you were suffering from economic hardship, why did you suddenly resign from your job? The child could also be given away to someone else. Why did you have to kill him? Is this child really your biological child, or is there something else going on? This should be investigated." Therefore, the police station is prosecuting him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. He then presented the photographs taken at the time and the defendant's confession as evidence. Gao Xiaofu confessed that Guisheng was indeed his biological child and that there were no other circumstances. He was indeed suffering from economic hardship and mental confusion and made a mistake in a moment of delusion. He begged for leniency and requested that a lawyer be brought to court to state that the defendant had a history of mental illness and should be examined. The presiding judge ordered the case to be adjourned and asked the forensic doctor to examine whether the defendant had a mental illness before further review.</p>
<p>Boiling an Infant: A Horrifying Incident. At 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 27th, Chinese police officer 27 from the 1133 Gordon Road Police Station was patrolling the area around Changping Road, Macgregor Road, when he saw someone cooking food in a metal pot on a vacant lot. He went forward to investigate and found the charred remains of an infant, about two months old, wrapped in newspapers. He was shocked. But there was no one else around, which was very strange. After a while, a Ningbo woman named Sun Chen, 33 years old, arrived, intending to clean up the pot. She was arrested. Upon questioning, she stated that she lived at 2 Lichang Road, Changping Road, nearby and that she did not know that the body of an infant was being cooked in the metal pot. She said that a female friend named A Yi had borrowed the pot in the morning. She was taken to the police station along with the metal pot. The police chief ordered that the infant's remains be sent to the autopsy room for examination. Yesterday morning, Sun was escorted to the First Special District Court. Jiang Baolian, a lawyer from the police station, explained the case and requested an extension for further investigation. Judge Huang Risheng questioned Sun Chen and ordered her to be remanded in custody. The case was adjourned pending the autopsy of the infant's body.</p>

<p>Song Baofu, owner of Hanyongji Shenzhuang (silk business) and resident of No. 16 Nianwu New Village, Fuxu Road, suddenly received a threatening letter on August 19. The letter was purportedly from the Third Detachment, stating that Song's business was thriving, which they believed was due to profiteering from the price fluctuations. They demanded 10,000 yuan, to be converted into US dollars, for the detachment's expenses, and instructed Song to send someone dressed in a light-colored long gown and carrying a two-and-a-half-pound thermos flask as identification to negotiate at 11:00 am on the 21st. No delays were allowed. The letter also included two bullets. Song reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which ordered an investigation. Subsequently, Song received a phone call from the bandits. Based on the clues, detectives arrested Shanghai native Mao Jianfei and Tongzhou native Hua Jinrong at the YMCA in the French Concession while they were making a phone call. Both were taken to the police station and were transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them according to the law. The defendants confessed to their crimes, claiming that the escaped Lu Arong was the mastermind. The judge sentenced Mao and Hua to ten months of imprisonment each. The threatening letter and bullets were confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Finance, Import Firms Still Mostly Settle Foreign Exchange in the Black Market <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw little change in the HSBC quoted rates and small counter exchange rates for British and US currencies. The black market rates for British and US currencies slightly softened because import firms could not wait any longer for the Stabilization Fund to maintain the black market. Therefore, they had to settle in the black market within the black market. Although Chinese merchants engaged in speculative selling of small amounts of long positions, Japanese banks secretly covered their short positions. The difference between the buying and selling prices of foreign banks was significant. The settlement price for US dollars had softened to 4.8125 yuan, and the British pound to 2 and a half shillings 875. No trading was reported in the afternoon. Although the price of the US dollar slightly recovered, it eventually tightened with the price of the British pound, and trading remained quiet.</p>

The British pound also softened to 2 shillings 875. It is rumored that Chinese merchants sold August US dollar contracts at 5.015625 yuan, but this could not be confirmed. At the noon closing, the settlement price for US dollars remained at 4.8125 yuan and the British pound at 2 shillings 875.</p>

<p>No trading was reported in the afternoon. The market remained stable, with a closing price of 4.84375 yuan for US dollars and 2 shillings 875 for the British pound, both tighter by 0.03125 compared to the closing prices before the holiday (August 26th).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market's cash market turned down, while futures rose, due to rumors that HSBC's small counter US dollar rate would be reduced to 5 yuan. Short sellers began to cover their positions, causing the price to rise from 6,712 yuan in the morning to 6,772 yuan before high-selling pressure was felt. Later, the price settled around 6,760 yuan, up 53 yuan, with most transactions being squared. In the cash market, Tong Kangyong sold 30 taels to Xiang He, 10 taels to Zhong Xing, 60 taels, and Fang Jiuxia sold 30 taels. Jun Xiangxing Yong bought all of them at 9,370 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British pound stand firm, while the price of the US dollar rose by 5 yuan due to stronger demand. British pound notes showed a weakening trend, and the market price fell. The opening price for US dollar notes was 1,935 yuan.

<h3 id="e49">Oil Market: Insufficient Rice Manipulation, Now Manipulating Oil. Rice Weevil is Truly Detestable. <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, vegetable oil and cottonseed oil suddenly rebounded. This was because general speculators, using the excuse of limited arrivals of raw soybean oil, became active again. The rice noodle gangs, with their abundant funds obtained from manipulating rice, came to disrupt the oil market, buying aggressively, causing the market to rise sharply from a weak state. Prices increased by 6-7 yuan across the board. Hua Chang vegetable oil sold 3,000+ barrels at prices from 191 yuan to 199.5 yuan. Da You Chang refined oil sold 2,000 dan at prices from 190 yuan to 197 yuan. Only 3,000 cans and 500 barrels of raw oil arrived, all bought up by dealers on the street at 290 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 2,045 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin yesterday, and 500 bags of raw peanuts arrived from Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Grains: Rumors of Another Price Cut for Bureau Rice, Rice Market Tense Then Relaxed, But No Reason for Price Increase Given Steady Supply <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, actual sales of foreign rice to local merchants were strong, and the market was quite lively. Speculators took the opportunity to become active, and the market appeared prosperous. As rice prices had been falling for several days, and the market price had been below the official selling price for a long time, local merchants and hoarders planned to increase their purchases. Moreover, some stimulation of the currency led to the belief that there was an opportunity to make profits. Ignoring the progress of the foreign exchange stabilization efforts, they thought the current rice merchants could be exploited. Therefore, small grain rice rose from 115 yuan to 118 yuan. Yinghua Company's small grain rice and Min Dang Road rice both rose from 141-142 yuan to 144 yuan, now priced at 139-141 yuan. Number 2 Siamese rice was 132 yuan, all higher by 2-4 yuan. However, after the price increase, it was suddenly rumored that the official selling price of small grain rice would be reduced by 6 yuan to benefit the public. It was also rumored that 13,000 bags of surplus small grain rice would be sold to dealers at 141.75 yuan per bag for free trading. As a result, market sentiment turned downwards, and the market was depressed by 1-2 yuan. Total transactions for the day were no less than 25,000 bags, with Yinghua Company selling 1,000 tons.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice arriving. The Taikoo Company's Nan Ning vessel arrived yesterday morning from Hong Kong, carrying 11,490 bags of foreign rice. After unloading cotton at the Pudong wharf, it will move to the parallel wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. The Java Company's Zhesa Danny mail ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, carrying a large amount of sugar and over 10,000 bags of foreign rice and 6,000 bags of corn from Java, docking at the Pudong Blue Funnel wharf for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>The market for thick and thin japonica rice remains tight due to limited arrivals. Local shops are competing for purchases, fearing they will miss out, and suppliers are taking the opportunity to raise prices. South Port early rice opened at 157-155 yuan, then rose by 3-4 yuan. High-quality Wuxi white japonica rice had no transactions due to lack of supply. Middle-quality rice opened at 147-145 yuan, and high-quality large grain rice at 153-154 yuan, also up by 2-3 yuan. New Pudong japonica rice slightly increased in price due to limited sales, opening at 157 yuan, 156.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice remained at its original price due to similar supply and demand, unaffected by the rise of other goods. High-quality Hong Kong white glutinous rice continued to sell from 129-125 yuan, glutinous rice at 116 yuan, falling to 111 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice lacked supply and had no market.</p>
<h3 id="e51">American Flour Has a New Settlement <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market saw strong actual sales because yesterday was Confucius' birthday and the market was closed for a day, so demand remained. However, both customers and dealers lacked interest due to the new settlement for American flour, Double Eagle brand, at around 31.8 yuan. Market sentiment was weak, so although gold and rice prices were reported to be rising, the flour market remained sluggish, with little trading in the quiet market. Jin Long flour sold for 31.9-31.95 yuan at the Puxi warehouse, 32.15-32.25 yuan at the Pudong warehouse, and Battery flour sold for 33.05-33.1 yuan, all falling by 0.2-0.3 yuan. However, the market fundamentals remained stable and it is unlikely to decline significantly in the short term. Wheat trading remained quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Bulls and Bears Relatively Equal, Current Situation Favors Bulls <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, but the trend became increasingly volatile. Guang Gang's demand remained relatively strong, with more purchases of 20-count yarn, so market sentiment was good. Short sellers covered their positions, and bulls added to their positions, pushing the market higher. The rise in American cotton by 40-50 pounds in the past two days was also a factor. However, the trend for 20-count Dongyang yarn, Blue Phoenix, and Moon Lute, was weaker, probably because profit-takers were exiting. The situation for 42-count fine yarn was also weak. Therefore, the yarn market may fluctuate. It is said that there are many large players who are both long and short, with relatively equal strength on both sides. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,731 yuan, and the low price was 1,716 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1,718 yuan, rising to 1,731 yuan, then falling back to 1,718 yuan. The closing price was 1,720 yuan, later trading to 1,721 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with enthusiastic sentiment and strong buying. The opening price was 1,720 yuan, rising briefly to 1,723 yuan, but some profit-takers sold, falling back to 1,717 yuan. It was then heard that the exchange had a gap of 30 yuan for the near term and 20 yuan for the distant term, which caused market sentiment to fluctuate. At the same time, 20-count yarn sales from Guang Gang were very good, and buying was strong, rising to 1,731 yuan. By the third session, the exchange had fallen back, market sentiment weakened, and the price fell to 1,716 yuan. However, as prices fell, buyers became active again, and Hong Gang bought 20-count yarn, holding prices firm, and the price rose again to 1,729 yuan. The closing price was 1,724 yuan. The total trading volume for half a day was 8,040 bales, including 540 bales for Hong Kong and 7,500 bales for domestic traders.</p>
<p>The futures price of Jin Shuang Ma was boosted by the sharp rise in American cotton for two days, and Indian and Brazilian cotton were also high. Therefore, factory orders were driven by the price increase, which led to a surge in yarn futures. The opening market in the morning was enthusiastic, with buyers arriving in droves, creating a strong buying atmosphere and a shortage of supply. Therefore, the opening price for the near term was 1,620 yuan, up 10 yuan. The October contract was 1,665 yuan, a sharp increase of 25 yuan. The November contract was 1,680 yuan, up 16 yuan. After that, the September contract was gradually raised, reaching a high of 1,627 yuan. However, with the exchange rising and falling, the bulls felt uncertain, so buyers hesitated and buying slowed down. Factory orders also softened, and floating longs exited, causing market prices to weaken. The September contract fell back to 1,616 yuan, the October contract to 1,644 yuan, and the November contract to 1,665 yuan. However, because the large players remained steadfast, it did not cause a major decline. The closing price for the September contract at noon was 1,616 yuan, the October contract 1,651 yuan, and the November contract 1,675 yuan. Fluctuations were smaller in the afternoon, showing a sideways trend. However, because short sellers continuously covered their positions, only the September contract was particularly strong, so it rose by 12 yuan. The October contract was 1,648 yuan, up 7.5 yuan, and the November contract was 1,669 yuan, up 5 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 17,670 bales, down 5,860 bales from the previous day. As of the evening of the 26th, the total number of stored bales in the past three months was 23,280, including 7,130 for September, 10,520 for October, and 5,630 for November. A record of the high and low opening and closing prices for the day is listed on the left. (These are net market prices)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Buying Foreign Cotton, Still Has Strength to Spare <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains strong because current yarn and cloth market prices are firm, and cotton prices are still expected to be high. However, trading volume has decreased significantly, and factories have no intention of purchasing, so the situation is calm, not as firm as before. However, cotton brokers still have transactions. Spot cotton market prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The foreign cotton market in Shanghai is firm and lively because the international situation is still stable, and all parties have surplus funds to continue ordering. Therefore, cotton brokers and yarn factories have continued to purchase American, Indian, or Brazilian cotton in recent days. It is expected that because foreign exchange is quite favorable and the cotton market is firm, there will be more enthusiastic development in the future.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially rose due to purchases by textile companies and poor cotton production. But later it fell slightly due to some profit-taking. The closing price was up 16-17 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling by brokers, then rose due to buying by speculators. Finally, the market fell again due to selling by European exporters and long liquidations. The closing price was up or down about one rupee.</p>
<p>The predicted opening market for today is expected to rise by 1.75 rupees.</p>
<p>Indian cotton shipped to Shanghai via Hong Kong: The Taikoo Company's Nan Ning vessel arrived yesterday morning from Hong Kong, carrying a large amount of foreign rice and 1,881 bales of cotton. The cotton was shipped from India to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai, unloaded at the Pudong Taikoo Company warehouse. (Zu)</p>

<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds was peaceful yesterday. Rumors spread widely, causing the market to continue to rise. Category C bonds broke through the 9-yuan level, and Category E bonds also approached 8 yuan. The situation is that short sellers are covering their positions, and Xinhua is buying strongly, so there is a possibility of continued price increases. In the morning, Shuntai Yi Zhong bought, and Yichang Dahua sold. The market was firm. In the afternoon, peaceful rumors spread, and demand exceeded supply. Category C bonds opened at 9 yuan and immediately broke through. Dachong, Tongkang, Xinfu, and Xinhua were all buying, either covering shorts or going long, showing increasing interest. Although Yitai, Tongshun, Runde, and Jiufeng sold, they were still unable to stop the upward momentum. The market closed at higher prices across the board, up 0.4-0.8 yuan. The total trading volume was over 2 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Speculation Also Cautious <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>

<p>The price of white coal has stabilized since the foreign exchange market returned to normal.

<h3 id="e60">Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Establishes Temporary Middle School <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>To Accommodate Students and Faculty from Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Shanghai Middle Schools</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education previously received an order from the Ministry of Education to establish ten temporary middle schools to accommodate middle school students and faculty who have withdrawn from Shanghai. While preparations were underway, wars broke out in Ningbo and Shaoxing counties in the province. Public and private middle schools were either temporarily closed due to budget cuts or unable to operate due to being in war zones. Faculty and students lost their jobs and schooling and urgently needed relief. The department telegraphed the Ministry of Education for approval to incorporate them into the temporary middle schools, which are scheduled to open in August. A method for registering students and faculty withdrawing from middle schools in Shanghai and the war zones of Ningbo and Shaoxing in the province has been established. Faculty and students from each school can register with the department within the prescribed period according to the regulations, for review and placement. According to reports, faculty and students from Ningbo and Shaoxing counties who can still contact their original schools can apply for registration through their original schools, which will report them within the prescribed period.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Primary School Teachers' Mutual Aid Society Celebrates Teachers' Day <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Primary School Teachers' Mutual Aid Society, affiliated with the Youth Association, held a celebration of Confucius' birthday and Teachers' Day the day before yesterday. Over a hundred members attended and celebrated together. Ms. Wu Ren-rui, the chairwoman, gave an opening speech. Then, Ying Tian-he, the chief of the Adult Education Department, spoke about Confucius' teachings. Next, Huang Zi-qiang discussed the origins of Teachers' Day. Its history began in the 20th year of the Republic of China, initiated by Nian Er She's Bu Shuang-qiu and others. The original date was June 6th, with the aim of improving teachers' salaries, protecting teachers' status, and enhancing teachers' cultivation. Every year on this day, there are enthusiastic celebrations everywhere. In the 28th year, the government officially designated August 27th, the anniversary of Confucius' birthday, as Teachers' Day. Our society is a resolution, and its significance is even more significant. We must emulate Confucius' spirit of being eager to learn and ask questions extensively, and tirelessly teach others. He asked officials about Tan Zi, asked about music from Chang Hong, learned the qin from Shi Xiang, and asked about rituals from Lao Dan. He was not ashamed to ask those below him and humbly received instruction, so he became a great scholar with extensive knowledge and abilities. He is a model for us teachers.</p>

<p>The third All-Shanghai Open Swimming Championship held its preliminary round at the Rowing Club on Wednesday evening at 6 PM. Of the four events originally scheduled, only four remained due to the withdrawal of Mike from the 880-yard freestyle: Jia Jun, Stephen Greefield, and Ge Peng Qigu Fu. Additionally, Blerna also announced his withdrawal from the 100-yard freestyle and 100-yard breaststroke. In the latter event, only Smith, Schuller, Mike, and Wang Zhongren remained, so the 880-yard freestyle and 100-yard breaststroke did not require preliminary rounds. Only the 100-yard freestyle and preliminary 100-yard freestyle were held as usual. As a result, Hai Jin and Lioni won the first place in their respective groups of the 100-yard freestyle, with Wen Jingling in second place. Hai Jin's time was 62.4 seconds. In the preliminary 100-yard freestyle, Bort and Heath won the first place in their respective groups. Bort's time was even better than Hai Jin's, clocking in at 6 seconds flat, which is quite commendable. The finals are scheduled to be held at the Rowing Club tomorrow evening. The results of the two events yesterday are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e70">Glimpses of Academic Life: The Teacher is an Idiot, Not a Robber <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<h3 id="e71">Student Union Creates Mind-Altering Soup <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Making a living by talking like a monkey king is, frankly speaking, difficult enough due to the inherent challenges. But occasionally—thankfully, only occasionally!—those incredibly powerful little friends give you a hard time with their little tricks, leaving you both exasperated and amused! I am now recording some of these magnificent achievements of the youth—at least you can say they are shining fragments from the academic world—for your enjoyment. As for myself, I will remain hidden and obscure, lest I deprive the academic world of a significant loss! Furthermore, everything I provide is factual. If there are any falsehoods, may I fall into the hell of having my tongue pulled out. Amen!</p>
<p>Respectful Title</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Banqiao said that teachers are "free prisoners without locks or shackles." But I think they are also qualified to be compared to robbers! Why? Because of their nicknames. Robbers have nicknames, and teachers, after the sharp eyes and close observation of the youth, will soon be given a vivid and lifelike title tailored to their heads, although occasional spur-of-the-moment coronations also happen. Since I, this humble one, do not enjoy special privileges, how could I be an exception? So, one time, when I was lecturing on the history of Cortez's conquest of Mexico in the early 16th century, a student deliberately paused between each syllable of the word Cortez, which I had written on the blackboard, and pronounced it "Gao, Er, Dai, Zi!" Immediately, an echo came: "Gao Er Dai Zi!" followed by another, mixed with laughter from others! I think that this was probably the completion of the "Respectful Title Ceremony" for me. However, I should especially thank the youth for not giving me the authentic title of "Robber," but calling me a "Bookworm," which truly makes them my confidants.</p>
<p>Mind-Altering Soup</p>
<p>Once, on an exam paper, I saw the history of King You of Zhou described as follows: "...Bao Si did not like to laugh, so she raised the beacon fire to summon the lords. When she saw them, she found it very funny; her laughter was extremely beautiful and charming, as if she had given King You of Zhou a bowl of mind-altering soup..." Grading exams is a painful task! But appreciating such a "magnificent masterpiece" truly makes one smile! At that time, I also became greatly inspired and composed a limerick: "The beauty does not laugh, causing the king great pain, the strange plan of beacon smoke pierces the heavens; her bright teeth are extremely beautiful and charming, a thick bowl of mind-altering soup!"</p>
<p>Dog Knife, Tiger Knife</p>
<p>At the same time, and completely by chance! Another paper described the tyranny of King Li of Zhou as follows: "...So he established the 'Dog Head Knife' and the 'Tiger Head Knife'; those who slandered him, commoners died under the Dog Knife, and ministers died under the Tiger Knife..." Besides admiring its extensive citations and detailed evidence, which supplement the shortcomings of historical records, I truly feel that You and Xia would not dare to say a word in praise!</p>
<p>Distinguishing the Male and Female Qilin One day in class, I don't know how we encountered the word Qilin, and suddenly someone stood up and asked: "Teacher! Is the Qilin male or female?" I can guarantee that I am not wronging him, this is someone who studies "The Dream of the Red Chamber," or perhaps he had just finished reading the section where Cui Lü and Xiang Yun discuss the issue of yin and yang. If I were to respond sharply and wittily, I should say: "Since you are not Cui Lü, and I am not Xiang Yun, let's not discuss this issue..." But how could I really do that? So, I had to use evasive language....</p>
<p>Please Come Early Tomorrow</p>
<p>There are indeed far too many young people seeking refuge in Shanghai now! After they are tired of playing in teahouses, restaurants, dance halls, movie theaters, or any other entertainment venues, they cannot help but sneak into schools for some recreation. In their hearts, they probably see teachers performing one-act plays as no different from watching Beijing opera... or watching monkey dances and horse shows. One day, it was the very last class, when my throat was dry and sore from shouting, and the end-of-class bell rang like a general amnesty, I clearly heard someone say: "Please come early tomorrow!" What do you say! What can you say?</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Please do not be pessimistic, Mr. Jian Nong. The "mind-altering soup" and "dog head knife" sayings, although not entirely accurate and not considered elegant, do reveal a kind of youthful spirit that defies conventions. If you are not bothered by it, why not use your skills to guide and correct them?</p>

<p>12 Unexpected Turmoil</p>
<p>"Miss Wu, someone has come to your house and says they need to see you urgently." He said to Mei Bao in a hurry.</p>
<p>She has only been away from home for less than a week. What urgent matter could her father have that he would send someone to see her? This could not help but make Mei Bao feel extremely surprised.</p>
<p>"Did he tell you what happened at my house?"</p>
<p>"No, he didn't. The person is still in the gatehouse, you should go down quickly!" After Chen Da finished speaking, he turned around and left.</p>
<p>Wang Gaojian and the three classmates also urged Mei Bao to hurry.</p>
<p>"It can't be that Dad is sick again." She ran downstairs all the way, constantly guessing in her mind: "Maybe that drunken Uncle Zhao has brought Mom back, so Little Dog is eager to come and take me back." But when she rushed into the gatehouse, she saw that the person who had come was not Little Dog at all.</p>
<p>"Miss, it's terrible! Something has happened at home again!" Although Mei Bao didn't recognize this person, as soon as this person saw Mei Bao, he immediately came forward and said to her with an extremely anxious look.</p>
<p>Such a stranger suddenly spoke to her, and Mei Bao naturally felt very abrupt. But looking at the person's attire, he was completely a farmer from the countryside, in his forties, and spoke with the local accent of Zhangshucun, with a very honest demeanor.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Mei Bao asked, staring at him blankly.</p>
<p>"I am Little Dog's maternal uncle. Miss, don't you recognize me?" The person took off a broken felt hat from his head, seemingly very hot and tired from running. "It was just after dinner yesterday; the son of the Ma family in the village got into a fight with Little Dog over gambling. Your father is too kind, and he went to mediate for them, but unexpectedly, that damned Ma Lao Si punched him twice in the chest, and he vomited a lot of blood when he came back. ..." (197)</p>
<p>Staff Can:</p>
<h3 id="e74">Organize a Consumer Cooperative <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jiansong</p>
<p>The increasing cost of living is a fact that everyone agrees on. In fact, our income is unlikely to increase tenfold. Prices are constantly "climbing upwards" day and night with "the passage of time," "rumor storms," etc., and our lives have to become more and more difficult day by day.</p>
<p>However, the desire to live a better life is something that everyone has. At this moment, in addition to striving for "increasing income," "reducing expenditure" is also important.</p>
<p>Here is a way to "reopen an old store" and "re-copy an old book"! From personal "reducing expenditure" to collective "reducing expenditure."</p>
<p>So, if you rely on individuals to save, no matter what, you can't jump out of the "palm of the Buddha's hand." But as long as everyone works together, it will be different - in a consumer cooperative, we can eat and use things that are much cheaper than on the market. This organization is undoubtedly a "cure" for the staff.</p>
<p>As for how to organize it, I think the "Customs Club Cooperative" and the "Banking Industry Friendship Association Consumer Cooperative" in Shanghai can be used as a reference for us. The goods sold inside can be simpler at the beginning, temporarily focusing on rice, coal, oil and other food and fuel as the main commodities, and then slowly expanding after the business develops. As for the source of the goods, try to transport them directly from the place of origin as much as possible. (Of course, this requires a larger-scale cooperative, but it may also be easier to succeed by contacting various industries and several cooperatives to jointly purchase.)</p>
<p>Regarding the source of funds, there are only the following three methods:</p>
<p>1. Ask leaders or bosses in various industries to subscribe for shares automatically.</p>
<p>2. Raise donations from all parties.</p>
<p>3. Staff members subscribe for shares themselves.</p>
<p>According to my estimation, these methods are feasible, because enlightened business leaders and direct superiors—bosses or managers—will agree to such an organization.</p>
<p>Similarly, after the staff's lives are more stable, they will also be better affected in their work.</p>
<p>At the same time, many unfamiliar colleagues in the same industry will gradually become familiar with each other through this cooperative, and they can also connect emotionally. When they have time, they can often gather together to talk about business, and perhaps they can discover insights from experience.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Such a Family <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ping</p>
<p>"Crash"! The sound of an item being smashed startled me. The quarreling downstairs started up like a radio again, constantly reaching my ears.</p>
<p>"Little devil! Do you want to die? What's the point of breaking my newly bought pen?" An 18-year-old youth was scolding his sister in a rote tone. "Slap!" A loud sound. Did the elder brother hit her?</p>
<p>The girl child cried out: "Killer! Dead turtle! How dare you hit me? So what if I broke your pen? You can't even earn money yourself, what are you putting on airs for?"</p>
<p>"Little devil! If you make another sound!" "Slap!" Another heavy blow. Then I heard the girl child rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>"Mom, help! Murder..." She screamed frantically.</p>
<p>"Little devil, making noise again." The mother came down from the drying rack, scolding as she walked. The family's amah followed behind her, secretly smiling with her mouth open.</p>
<p>In a moment, the daughter was complaining. The mother favored her daughter, scolding her son for not hitting her: "You little piece of floating corpse! You're reading into your asshole, who deserves you to hit them? You even dare to throw things. I, your mother, am not dead, and you dare to be so lawless? You'll definitely end up sleeping in an alley."</p>
<p>The son refused to accept it. Thus, the daughter's crying; the son's resistance; the mother's scolding; the amah's persuasion; all became one.</p>
<p>My ears were deafened.</p>

<p>A friend of mine talked about starvation on the isolated island. According to him, he witnessed a drunkard in front of a restaurant on Nanjing Road, his face red and his ears burning, staggering out. He walked to the side of the sidewalk and couldn't help but vomit violently, spewing out a large amount of filth. At that time, a ragged man rushed forward, folded his hands together in a scoop shape, held the filth and ate it. Passersby stopped to watch, surprised.</p>

<p>— Jingyuan</p>
<p>Which artist, deceased for a long and enduring fifteen years, still manages to leave a vivid impression in the minds of every audience member, apart from Rudolph Valentino, known in the silent film era as the "Great Lover of Movie Fans?"</p>
<p>A few days ago marked the fifteenth anniversary of Valentino's death, which has already been recorded in this publication. Here is a brief account of his life.</p>
<p>First, I must say that he was not American. His father was Italian and his mother was French. His original name was extremely long. The name Rudolph Valentino was changed after he arrived in the United States in 1913.</p>
<p>His father was a captain in the Italian cavalry, but he told his son to study agriculture. Therefore, when he first arrived in New York, he found a job in horticulture. At the same time, he learned the extremely popular dances of the time, and the following year he joined a song and dance troupe. Then, as the film industry boomed, he jumped into Hollywood. Initially, he only acted in comedies. It was not until "Camille" was completed that he began to change his style. "Blood and Sand" in 1913 and "Monsieur Beaucaire" in 1924 both won the honor of being ranked third among the top ten blockbusters. Other famous films, such as "The Four Horsemen," were also extremely successful, making Paramount a lot of money. His name swept across the United States, and there were countless women who worshiped him. Several even died of lovesickness for him. Although he was married, he was still known as the "Great Lover of Movie Fans." At that time, Ronald Colman was still a minor actor, and the fame of Douglas Fairbanks and John Barrymore was far inferior to his. The six years before his death were truly his golden age.</p>
<p>In 1926, after filming a movie, he went to New York for a vacation. On August 23rd, he unfortunately died in a swimming accident. Although he was given emergency treatment by famous doctors, he eventually fell into a long and silent sleep.</p>
<p>He only lived to be thirty-one years old. If he were alive today, he would be forty-six years old, much younger than Ronald Colman! Every year on August 23rd, there are always two women lingering and wandering in front of Valentino's tomb, no matter the wind or rain, they always arrive every year. This year will probably be no exception!</p>

The day before yesterday afternoon, Tang had a secret talk with Zhang Shankun, the content of which is unknown, but it probably involved joining the National United Film Company to star in a film.</p>
<p>The female lead role for the New Art Drama Society's first revival project, "Lust," has been taken by Bai Hong, and the male lead has been decided as Liu Qiong. This decision was found in the list of key members of the society, with the name of cartoonist Zhang Yingchao. It is said that Zhang is the "Minister of Finance" of the new New Art.</p>
<p>Since moving into the Meicheng Factory, Jin Xing Company has experienced many inconveniences due to the small studio size. Recently, more work is underway, on a large open space behind the Meicheng Factory. Once the new studio is built, Jin Xing can work in two places, and the output can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>The one-week anniversary of the opening of the National United Grand Theater is approaching. It is said that "Forever and Ever" by Yi Hua has been internally decided as the celebratory screening. Therefore, the day before yesterday, the two authorities specially discussed how to carry out various plans for promotion.</p>

<p>— Kou Hong</p>
<p>The folk opera artist Wang Xiuying is known among her peers as "Little Monster." Her voice is hoarse, and she has the enviable title of "Dan voice." In the past, when she and Gu Jincai formed the "Huaguang Opera Troupe," she was very popular. After marrying Zhu Binsheng (also a member of the Huaguang Troupe, acting as "Romantic Young Man"), she left "Huaguang" and started her own career. This summer, she is making a comeback, and she and Zhu have both been hired by the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Company to perform at the Queen's Theater. Gu Jiang said that Wang Xiuying has a "prima donna temper," and is not someone who can rely on others. She has been performing in the Shanghai Opera Company for less than a month, and she does not want to be dependent on others, so she suddenly wants to leave. She has now decided to form her own troupe with Zhu Binsheng to perform. Although she is married, her charm is still full like a young girl. This decision to make a comeback will surely make her famous again for a time.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Where Can One Find a Hao Family to Carry Her Home?</p>
<p>When Tian Hongyu heard this, he couldn't help but suddenly froze. He looked at his daughter's face and said with a smile, "Are you deliberately joking with your father? You are not a man, but a daughter. What use do you have to borrow this beauty from me? If you were my son, I might as well let you have her." Tian Fei heard her father speak so generously, knowing that he had not yet understood the true meaning in her heart. So, she said in a serious tone, "Father, I am not joking with you. I really want to borrow her. I know this is a beautiful scenery for you, Father, but I have my own difficulties and have no choice but to do so. Please grant my request, Father." Tian Hongyu was shocked when he heard Tian Fei speak so seriously. "Are you not joking with me? What exactly is going on? I don't understand." Tian Fei frowned tightly and said, "Father, don't you know that the world is in great chaos today, and the rebel bandits are rampant? There is no clean land in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Sichuan. Therefore, the Emperor is worried about this day and night, neglecting his sleep and forgetting his meals. He has not had a smile for a long time. I am afraid that he will damage his health with worry. How can he govern the country? I always want to make him temporarily forget his sorrows and find some joy, but I can't find a way. We are confident that our beauty is mediocre. How can it compare to the beauty of Yuanyuan? Why not offer Yuanyuan to the Emperor, to win his joy and relieve his worries? If the Emperor is happy, my heart will be at ease, and Father will also have great merit. Wouldn't that be better than enjoying it yourself?" Tian Hongyu glanced at his daughter and nodded, "Although what you said makes sense, you also have to think about it. What if the Emperor favors Yuanyuan and neglects you? Will you willingly give up and not feel a bit sour? Don't regret it!" Tian Fei said, "Of course I have considered this. I only feel that the most important thing is to make the Emperor happy. Other things will be easy to handle. Even if the Emperor favors Yuanyuan, I think Yuanyuan was presented by us. The Emperor is inherently kind and will definitely not abandon the old for the new. Please don't worry too much about me, Father. It is a great fortune if you agree to my request."</p>
