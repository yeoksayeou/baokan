<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴爾幹的「閃電戰」</h3>
<p>德義到底不得不以大量武力，同時進襲南希兩國；此舉實因受了當前形勢的逼迫，纔將他們近今所作種種策動，誘說和威脅工作，都宣吿了完全的失敗。這在德國的代言人，也承認是他的敵人們所企圖使之出現的局勢。而允爲世人所注意的，乃為蘇南互不侵犯條的，就在這戰爭爆發的前夕簽字；可見這决德義舉動，顯然與蘇聯的基本利益及維持巴爾幹和平的願望，絕對走了相反的方向；這又是德義方面歷來所竭力設法避免，而為英希等國現在所感覺安慰的。故在巴爾幹大戰爆發之後，德義面前立即出現了兩種不利的新形勢：第一，德義集團今後不得不在歐洲東西兩面同時作戰；第二，德蘇現存的友好關係，已經漸趨破裂之途。如果戰事久延不決，則將來演變中對於德義的可能惡劣影響，必不堪設想；爲德義計，他們這一决巴爾幹冒臉戰的最高戰略，應該是再訴之於所謂「閃電戰術」。這兩天來的一般觀察，也都認為他們現在的最大企圖，就在於重演兩年前的波蘭戰役。</p>
<p>波蘭戰役開始的時候，侵略軍的第一步即是大舉轟炸交通中心；工業區域，以及人口稠密的城市，使波蘭全部領土，立刻陷人了混亂狀態；其次，立刻對他展開三面包圍的形勢，循着許多路綫，同時舉行突破防綫的猛攻；於是在不足一星期之間，發現進攻路綫共有十餘路之多，使波蘭防守軍手忙脚亂，不到兩個禮拜便瓦解了波蘭的整個戰爭機構。這種煊赫猛烈的戰術，一直到現在，還很深刻的留在大家記憶之中。這决巴爾幹大戰，兩三天來除了德義在南希兩國的殘酷轟炸，已經在猛烈進行外；而陸軍方面亦已發現了至少分爲七路進攻，和上决的波蘭大戰形勢，幾予是如出一轍。德義在地理上，對於南希兩國佔着三面包圍的形勢：在東面，德國根據了保加利亞，循着四條路綫，開始進攻。在北面，分爲三路進攻，一以羅馬尼亞為根據，二以匈牙利為根據，三以奧國爲根據。至於南希兩國的西面，却在義大利本土與阿爾巴尼亞的威脅之中，海上沿亞德里亞海的綿長地帶，若爲義大利力量所及，隨時隨地可以登陸。</p>
<p>三天來的戰績，現在還不十分明悉，將來的勝敗，當然目前也不得而知。綜合各方報道，德國方面，據說這决已運用了陸軍達五十萬人左右；而南斯拉夫陸軍大概在一百萬左右，英國在希臘登陸的軍隊也達六十萬人；此外，再加上義希兩國的軍力；這無疑的醖釀着一塲大戰。至於戰略：德義方面絕對需要速戰速決，無論所傳德方表示放棄閃電戰術說，何所根據，但德義必然期待閃電有效，一鼓而下。至於英南希聯軍方面，根本與對方不一樣，當前的第一要圖，是在穩定戰局，免得蹈波蘭覆轍。一俟納粹軍的「閃電戰」鋒芒頓挫之後，就可使戰爭漸漸入於持久的局面，這樣，他們抵抗戰的最大目的，也就完成了一半。所以，據傳南國京城已經向南遷移，信當然是戰略上有此必要，庶幾與英希軍取得更密近的聯絡。再就希臘方面說，最吃緊的是與土英兩國海陸兩方面的聯繫地帶，所以。牠必須用任何代價，防禦土希邊界通道及海上各港。南斯拉夫最要緊的，却在於保衛牠南部與希臘之間的疆土，同時竭力阻止義大利的任何登岸企圖，以便從海上可以始終與英軍保持聯繫，接受美國的接濟。所以昨天南國軍隊的採取攻勢，向阜姆自由市，義屬薩拉，及阿爾巴尼亞境內的斯庫台里等地，同時進襲，意義就在於此。</p>
<p>這次巴爾幹大戰，德義戰略的基本弱點，一在對巴爾幹半島，允其對南斯拉夫，根本不準備發生這塲大戰；二在閃電戰已經不是最新的策略，對方已有對付的經驗了。即就「閃電戰」而論，亦有三種最大障碍：第一，是德義軍力的分散，除掉防守西北沿邊兩千哩的海岸綫，東部與蘇聯的交界綫而外，還必須在各征服地駐紮防軍，像對波蘭那樣集中大軍的猛攻，現在幾乎不可能。第二，地理上，南希的山岳地帶，不同於波蘭的西部平原。而最重要的第三個障碍，是英國海軍的幾乎完全控制希南兩國的海面，使接濟可以源源不斷的增加。據不久以前英國地中海艦隊司令克銀漢所述，義大利艦隊在托蘭多，意屋尼安海面兩决大戰，加上其他小接觸，所受的損失，戰鬥艦去了三分之二，巡洋艦及驅逐艦失了百分之五十以上，潛水艇損失百分之二十到三十。英國艦隊的絕對優勢下，德義無論如何，難以把南希置之於波蘭那樣外援斷絕的窘境。</p>
<p>最後，還必須指出的，是英希南方面空軍的力量，在美國無限制接濟下，也絕不是兩年多以前的波蘭可比。從上述種種看來，德義閃電戰術在這决成功的可能性，甚爲渺茫。</p>
<h3>希南邊界將成大戰塲地勢險峻於德軍不利</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日斯丹埠消息所稱、德軍經由色雷斯至愛琴　一節、足以表明德軍已在希臘與土耳其間構成一楔形、以阻止希臘及南斯拉夫任何來自海路之增援、德人並或可對在斯特魯馬河流域及納夫羅哥甫高原作戰之希軍予以側面之攻擊、此項側擊目必依循自散德至達拉瑪及西爾斯之鐵路進展、但吾人敢信、英希高級指揮部自必對此决威脅早鑒及而有完全之準備、主要之戰爭係在納夫羅哥甫高原及期特魯馬河流域、而盧泊爾山之戰爭允爲重要、薩洛尼加至少為此等戰爭之目的物，然而即令德人竟得越羅泊爾山　而進入斯特魯馬河流域之平原地帶、其困難尙不能謂為過去、蓋通達薩洛尼加之路、地勢叉陡然高聳而至三千呎以上、在此種成爲天然屏障之地形上、希臘軍隊又可佈說防禦以拒絕德軍、且經由盧汩爾山隘之德軍交通綫、亦恐將常遭聯軍之轟炸也、此間軍界人士均一致以為德軍對南斯拉夫之攻勢、似乎注重在斯柯泊勒、該地係主要交通中心、苟被德軍佔領、則南斯拉夫南　與該國其餘部分之連絡使為隔斷矣、（八日合衆電）</p>
<h3>南軍被迫自塞南撤退　致希軍左翼失却掩護</h3>
<p>雅典　塞維亞南部之南斯拉夫軍隊、已在偉大壓迫之下實行撤退、致希軍之左翼失去掩護、希軍現正奮力作戰、以圖彌補此　　隙、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>叙利亞邦首府　據此間所獲電訊、南斯拉夫北路軍刻正依照預定計劃、向薩伐河撤退、德軍集中保加利亞境內者、雖有十二師之衆、但不能全部用以攻擊南國、緣希臘政府已在色雷斯區東端馬里察河一帶、集中兵力、德軍勢不能不騰出一部份兵力、以注意此綫戰事也云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　義大利無綫電台今晨發出消息稱、希臘軍隊欲在阿爾巴尼亞境內與南斯拉夫軍隊取得聯絡一項企圖、已歸失敗、希臘軍一師全軍覆沒、我軍截獲大批俘虜及軍用品云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本對蘇深具戒心</h3>
<p>東京　「朝日新聞」評論蘇南締結互不侵犯條約後、德蘇關係之前途誷、蘇聯之第一道防線既在保障韃靼尼爾海峽與多瑙河口之安全、則蘇聯將在可能範圍內、以全力壓制德國、蘇聯假「和平與中立政策」之名議、刻在巴爾幹半島漸獲政治上利益、蘇方日後行動、必須加以審慎注視、但德蘇關係不致立即發生危險云、「國民新聞」以「蘇聯與中美已有妥洽為疑」、並警告日本慎視蘇美之將來行動、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>歐戰叢談（四三）　戰時德國的內幕</h3>
<p>在柏林市上，向婦女搭訕一事，現在已突然不再存在了其一部分原因由於燈火管制之下，男女雙方大家都無從打量，難以下手，一部份則因希特勒對出征軍人的妻子們負著保護的責任。一天，有一個人向出征軍人的新娘詐取了十六元，竟判處死刑而以身殉。</p>
<p>即在承平之時，德國婦女的衣著向來撲質而不動人，可是去年秋季，旅行德國的人看見她們所穿的衣服，並不視從前為劣。目下德國婦女的衣著的消費分配額為一百五十分，（去年為一百分），尚不夠她們每隔一年做一件衣服（每件衣服須六十至八十五分）之需，因為餘下來的分配額必定要留起來，以為購買襯衫，襪子，手帕，手套之用·但是德國的成衣匠也真夠能耐，他們能把隔年的舊衣服改做一件新裝。德國人雖然佔據了巴黎，德國婦女卻喜歡紐約的時裝樣子。今天秋季，我會為熟悉的德友女眷們所包圍，因為她們聽說拙荊來柏林訪我之頃，曾把所帶來的六七本美國時裝雜誌遺留我處，他們便視同　寶了。</p>
<p>在德國女太太們看來，德軍佔領法蘭西和比利時，真是天賜之福。她們每年衹准購買六雙襪子，因之預算在熱天只好赤著腳下不穿襪。但是結果並不如此。去年五六月間，戰事還未趨於結束，幾百萬雙法國真絲襪已直向德境擁來，金風送爽之時，德國女太太們所置的絲襪，其數量之多，實為有生以來所有未有。德國兵索性把不值錢的紙馬克都買了絲襪朝家裏寄，德國郵政局特地備了好幾輛運貨汽車，把一包包的東西，交給兵士們的妻子，女兒和情人。暮秋之季，我　遊法比，所有店鋪老闆，連小鎮裏的亦在內，指點著那些空空如也的貨架在那裡嘆氣。所有的絲襪，女用襯衫和香肥皂等等，已經一箍腦兒被購完了。德國人對於肥皂一物，最感需要，自從戰事發生以來，只有一種好像粗肥皂似的東西在市上出售。那東西粗糙得砂石一般，好像工廠洗盥室中所備用的肥皂。德國婦女們說這種東西雖有去污之功，可是對於皮膚則大有妨礙哩。</p>
<p>如果戰事漫延下去，德國人的衣著問題將大感嚴重。德國所用的棉花完全由外國輸入，羊毛亦幾乎本國一些沒有出產產。要是你想換件新外套的話，你先得把舊衣服拿去，而且那舊衣服一定要襤褸不堪，當局纔能答應你換新的。德國的皮草十分缺乏，皮草一定要穿到無可修補，纔有資格去領購新鞋。一個人如果要買一套新衣服，須支用全年衣服分配量的三分之二，這樣一來，他就不能再購買新內衣，襪，襯衫，汗衫，手帕和手套。紡織品在德國亦頗稀少，即軍隊中亦感影響，甚至連厚外套都無法制備了。戰事爆發之初，德國人把由捷克掠來的制服，分散給陸軍中的工程隊，這些制服好在都是現在的，連顏色都不必費心去染。在前被迫工作的所謂「陶德社」員，人數多至數十萬，他們都不穿制服。當我在前線看到他們時，這班人身上只穿著破舊不堪的便服。至於德國的老百姓所穿的衣服都以一種纖維借用品制成，八千萬人民都這樣的保持他們的體溫。</p>
<p>人民亟需衣服取暖，這個問題在去冬格外覺得重要。那時氣候嚴寒，為近百年內所未有，大半的家庭和辦公室內，一連幾星期有沒生火。老百姓身上一冷，民氣即為動搖。去年夏天，政府把上兩年冬季（冷得並不厲害）所剩下來的煤，以百分之八十供給人民，而在另一方面，老百姓感覺到冬季沒有火爐的苦況，先在夏季幾個月內把煤積儲起來。但是政府總希望老天幫忙，冬季不要太冷，並自夏徂秋，除了星期六之外，禁止民間用熱水洗澡。在柏林城中，惟有阿特隆旅館一個地方，隨時能洗到熱水澡。那時候，旅客只限於外國人，去冬有好幾天，我的房間內塞滿了德國朋友，他們非等著想洗個澡，便是來烘烘暖。</p>
<p>德國缺少熱水或沒有暖氣房間，並不是由於缺乏煤斤的緣故，德國擁有大量的煤，但是其運輸上三分之二都仰給於運河水道，而去年和今年冬季，所有水路都遭凍結。鐵道運輸極為繁忙無暇運煤。因為西線的德軍一定要好好的給養著，即駐紥在「東陲」，正對著「友好」的蘇聯紅軍，也不能叫他們挨餓。（未完）</p>

<p>小麥　昨日小麥市況、平靜如故、查國麥來源、久已家落、洋麥亦以海外船位缺乏、洋行定貨、無法接受、麥市交易、早已無形停頓、目下日廠方面、對於門市吸收、亦屬無日可收、舊價仍在四十五六元之間、在米粉看漲中、市面亦然帶穩、</p>
<h3>雜糧　投機再起　油餅雜糧無一不抬</h3>
<p>昨日油豆餅雜糧市場、因人心受空氣支配、踢皮球生意又告繁興、致市價紊亂不清、驚波駭浪、頗多曲折、結果大連油因現貨籌碼短缺、（有一部份四千餘桶新到貨、因水氣太重、尚在化驗、不及交貨、）被紗花幫有意軋空、行情猛抬四五元、成效現貨三百桶、期貨一千四百桶、廠油二百擔、花生油趨勢平平乏神、黃豆突升二元、天津豆因貨厚、衹砌高六七角、成效各豆一千四五百包、豆餅做開期現各餅二萬六千餘片、價提四五角、苞米漲二三元、成效現貨五千餘包、期貨四百噸、</p>

<h3>金融　有煤油洋花結款　外匯轉緊</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌平定、英美匯暗市、潛勢回緊、乃因上日所傳並無根據、美匯開盤即軟、且洋行界實需繁多、如火油棉花均有結款、而投機家浮空稍有抵補、惟外行有利等均有供意、故中塗情況頗平、迄收盤英金告三辦士二五、美匯呈五元三四三七五、結果比隔昨軋縮〇一五六二五及〇三一一五、期貨英平美亦稍軟、</p>

<h3>外幣稍稍上升</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價、盤旋趨漲、英美金鎊因亦各升一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票跌後轉漲、始曾退至二角四分、旋即步漲、晚市高至十八元四角、比上日軋升一角一分、香港票趨勢轉堅、市價挺漲、日金票及朝鮮票均趨堅挺、前者高至一元九角七分、後者高至一元六角二分、</p>
<h3>掉期已屆　金市補空反漲</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗盤、因上日謠風已息、且匯市處於洋行結款下、由鬆回緊、故金市亦步趨堅硬、傍晚潛勢尤挺、已越出六千五百元關、事因經營者看此次掉期、照美匯結價做撳、故仍由買方貼入五六十元可能、致一般浮空紛起抵補、中以恒記同康永吸入尤多、加之大豐頻吸、故結果回升五十元、全天交易約一萬六七千兩、現金成效頗鬧、計祥興永先進祥和一百九十兩、成記六十兩、及永成五十兩、均加一百八十元、繼之又漲裕興永興永成各五十兩、加一百七十五元、後天元賣予天成十兩、及順原三十兩、衹加一百七十元、後市立泰進錢豐四十兩、加一百八十元、比上日約高八十元、飾金關金等均平、</p>

<p>晨初每條（十兩）、開市堅穩、首告六千四百七十元開盤、較上日做好十五元、繼又漲起五元、仁承永　過六千四百七十五元、但此後賣風忽起、天元空頭加碼、新豐永多頭了結、價一度做小至六千四百六十元、旋賴同康永恒記成記德孚等競吸補空、大豐亦來買入、日不久匯市續緊、故逐升至六千四百八十八元、十時後鑫源祥和多頭出籠、接跡新豐永順原亦賣、但斯時買戶仍有、致潛勢頓走盤旋、漲跌於六千四百八十八元至七一五元之間、迄收盤為六千四百八十五元、後市開市仍告六千四百八十五元、嗣曾降小三元、奈恒記同康永復補空、大豐亦續收買、但成記祥和散戶等則有塞出、張漲至六千四百九十七元、即告回平、迄收盤前十分鍾、卒因恒記同康永大豐等再進、斯時散戶搶進價逐一霎那漲至六千五百十元、後新豐永德成德大吐出、回小七元、惟收盤則為六千五百〇五元、結果比上日軋漲五十元、照四月美金五元三一二五結價、為六千五百五十五元三角、計揪五十元〇三角、收市後又升至六千五百十元、最後六千五百〇八元、全日高低亦五十元、現金號之本牌金售價、比烚赤期交價高二百元、收　比售出低八十元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<h3>紗花　多方故布疑陣　雙馬放洋　市盤重出四百元關</h3>
<p>紗市由迥旋而趨上升、此因多頭方面放出雙馬紗有　批向海外運銷之空氣、兼之雜牌紗步步前進、尤使人心振作、但港幫銷路尚屬平庸、買去各紗計二百七十包、所以空頭安然不動、市狀仍無緊俏之象、不過多方監於雙馬日見推動、心意趨高一步、做多者頗不乏人、故本日之市況、微顯活絡之勢、不若昔日之呆木滯鈍局面也、二十支雙馬高價為一千四百元、低價為一千三百九十三元半、午後初做一千四百零二三元、旋後人心挺秀、逐步上升至一千四百十元、最後價為一千四百零九元半、今日有棉紗三十七件運庇能、六十二件運新加坡、四百七十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市氣尚平凡、因巴爾幹戰事尚烈、空方活動、首盤價為一千三百九十六元、且賣風較熾、叫喊紊亂、跌至一千三百九十三元半、旋後外匯平定、標金銷昂、場內實勢已止、買者尤盛、多方且又謠傳雙馬將運往德國之舉、一時買戶踴躍、又復回升至一升三百九十八元半、但港幫採辦不旺、情況又軟、迨至收盤時、聞雜牌紗售價甚昂、空頭抵補、漲至一千四百元收盤、查半日間成交統計三千七百四十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如工、</p>

<h3>細絨有漲無跌</h3>
<p>現棉情況依然良好、但印棉跌風殊　、　棉亦續下落、然人心未受重大打擊、此因巴爾幹戰局恐蔓延、將後來源、或生問題、所以廠方需要雖未十分旺盛、然同業中心思一致望高也、細紗原料造成有漲無跌之局面也、昨共計成交一千三百三十九件、又四百包價尚平平、附錄現棉行市如左、</p>

<p>另訊見熱烈、蓋以同業互做意興甚濃、而廠方需貨亦設、連日成效除印棉巴西棉外、更以細紗原料為眾矢之的、不論廠方與同業皆奮力爭購之、因之棉市已入佳境、活潑堅昂、兼而有之也、昨日巴西棉之市價、曾做三百七十餘元之高價云、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、晨初先因外商賣出、及巴爾幹戰事影響而跌、唯後又因一部分空頭抵補而稍回漲、結果收盤價、較之上日低落六至十磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、因有大量多頭了結、及賣方一再售出而跌、昨日收盤價格、約跌八九十羅比不等</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布粵銷劇增　售盤上騰</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市始平繼漲、乃因連日粵港現銷劇增、各廠近期貨額已　半開　、　引起業內外囤積心思、售盤雙趨上騰、結果白貨細布斜紋漲二角半、粗布漲二角半至五角、色布漲五角、金三塔漂布漲五角、餘牌平平、本街成交各布六百餘件、粵漲幫辦色布色斜　呢等四百餘件、浙閩幫辦粗細布色布等一百餘件、</p>

<h3>根據地皮章程　工董應依法產生　華人嚴守緘默靜待發展　葡瑞俄僑民均熱烈競選</h3>
<p>衆目暌暌之工部局董事選舉事、已進人嚴重之階段、蓋據昨日關係方面消息、三國總領事之談判、將吿結束、英美雙方對於改變工董名額、聞經中國政府核准一點、仍不放棄其一貫之「綏靖」政策、而租界之合法地位、遽呈動搖之象、雖昨日各關係官方、諱莫如深、拒絕發表任何評論、惟衆信各國仍將　然違法、擁戴依據「新比率」而推出之候選人爲下屆工部局董事、但全市華人方面、猶嚴守緘默、靜待今後局勢之發展、茲誌各情如决、</p>
<p>法律觀點　應予注意</p>
<p>依照洋涇浜地皮章程第十條之規定、工部局西董人數不得超過九名、亦不得少於五名、換言之、西董之合法人數爲五人至九人、目前西董、英五、美·日·各二、合爲九人、固無可非議、但「新比率」將西董由九人增至十二人、顯爲非法行爲、此其一、至於華董、依照同條規定、由納稅華人會推出五名、而今减至四人、亦屬遠法、此其二、另據第十八條規定、地皮章程如須修正更改或增添條文、其最後之決定在於中國各條的國使節及中國最高當局、而今三國總領事之談判「議決」改變局董人數在先、並不將議案呈請我中國當局核准在後、於法自有不當、又按照國際公法、任何國家須得各國或多數國家承認後，在國際間方有合法地位、今各國均承認重慶為中國合法政府、如英·美·當局採相反措施、則不發生法律效力、</p>
<p>留滬華董　尙有三人</p>
<p>關於工部局華董問題、因有關租界數百萬華人之利益、故性質至爲嚴重、目前華董中已有數人離滬、所遺之缺、依照地皮章程第二十條之明文規定、工部局董事曾得以多數通過全權另推候補人、（如上决美董卡納辭職返國董事會另推明思德繼仟）而現存之納稅華人會決不致違法推出候補人員、故如以後董事會不另委適當人員以補數華董之缺、則任何方面不得擅自推出候補之人員、吾則亦爲違法行爲、目前華董處　、雖極困難、但爲數百萬同胞之幸福計、理當竭力維持其合法地位、昨日記者自負責方面探悉、工部局華董中離滬者僅虞洽卿·陳霆銳·兩氏、外傳郭順離滬之說、絕對不確、其他兩董爲奚玉書及袁履登、故留滬華董尙有三人、較之所謂「新比率」尙少一人、唯各方對郭奚袁三氏無不寄予殷切之期望、</p>
<p>德候選人　爲葛樂泰</p>
<p>四川路四一〇號德商雅利洋行昨函本報、略謂頃閱貴報載有英美德日局董候選人、內有德籍董事一席、將由本埠德僑高來德氏擔任、上述姓名、應請賜予更正為「葛樂泰」等語，查葛君姓名之原文爲Alfred　Glathe、合爲刋布、</p>
<p>葡瑞僑民　準備人選</p>
<p>葡萄牙　民方面、頗有得佔中立董事一席之望、但葡僑尙未決定推荐何人出任葡董、駐滬葡總領事梅洛、已與他國總領事有所接觸、而希望不日即能宣布葡董候選人之姓名、駐滬瑞士總領事方丹納答覆記者稱、此間瑞士僑民有被推爲工董候選人之可能者、寥寥無幾、瑞士僑民將於數日內集會、以便決定推出何人、</p>
<p>白俄方面　圖得一席</p>
<p>工部局擬更變董事名額、另添中立董事兩人事、頗引起本市白俄之激動、聞白俄間已擬具推薦俄董一人之計劃、但迄未宣布將推何人、俄文報紙均載關於工董英舉之文字、謂上海俄僑共有二萬五千人、較諸其他人數較少之中立僑民更有獲得董事一席之權、白俄多居法租界、固屬事實、但在公共租界寄居或經商者仍有數千人、俄報父稱、白俄對於公共租界之建立、亦有一份功績、而工部局警務處白俄隊、於過去十四年來、爲工部局與公共租界服務、成績良好云、聞白俄移民委員會已因工董選舉事一度集會，並未商得決議、但據消息靈通人士聲稱、葡萄牙與瑞士僑民皆有各佔中立董事一席之最佳機會、白俄之機會則絕微、聞白俄移民委員會將於本星期六舉行大會、討論此事、</p>

<h3>煙兌市况平疲難振　投機遭受打擊</h3>
<p>烟兌業市况至爲平疲、各類日用品如肥皂·火柴·洋燭·火油及烟草、現貨去路已不若前之暢旺、同時因市塲現貨去路减退、市塲籌碼不無增加、已呈供過於求之勢、前昨兩日同業買賣頗穩定如恒、一般投機市儈、亦已技窮、其價佈謠言、顯已無人信以爲眞、故若輩雖猶圖挽頽勢、卒因人心難振、頗感鼠竄不定、昨據熟悉烟兌業情形者語人稱、上述各類日用物品、自被投機市儈抬高市價後、人心咸感不安、紛在市塲猛扒現貨、企圖穩藏、靜待高價脫手、其時市塲現貨出售者幾屬寥寥、惟各製造廠咸爲應市消起見、均經增加生產、故近日市塲現貨已逐漸增多、同時一般市民亦因價高、均零星購買、以致實消反趨淸淡、故各烟兌店已無意繼續在市塲扒吸、今持有大宗現貨之衆外投機、頗感極人不安、因共所有囤貨、皆係於高價時所購進、現則市價鬆懈、勢必賤出、况若輩資力有限、無法久囤、故彼輩頗遭受損失、如再不醒悟、預料勢將再受嚴　打擊、</p>

<h3>游覽自由中國的　赫明威的生平　美國當代戰爭文學之介紹</h3>
<p>— 宇楨</p>
<p>「號角鼓聲」在去年出版，是他的代表作。內容以一對靑年男女四天短促的戀愛爲經，以西班牙法西斯派國民軍與共和軍內戰爲緯，結構與「吿別戰爭」相仿，特前者以上决歐戰的尾聲爲背景，彼時作者以爲戰爭不過是無意義的屠殺，故書中描寫男女主角萍水相逢，亟圖片刻之歡。在後一部書裏，作者已承認戰爭非但不是發狂，且具有莫大意義和重要性，人們爲着榮譽，應不顧兒女私悄。他對於當世虛僞的「英雄主義」和「愛國主義」，原不勝鄙夷，現亦不復作如是觀了。</p>
<p>故高唱「回到戰塲」的道部「號角鼓聲」，道出了人們的衷腸，絕非庸俗的愛情小說可比。從另一方面看，這是一本政治小說。作者認爲西班牙內戰，就是現行歐戰的序幕，暗示世界上任何一個民族的敗亡，都會影響到其他的民族。官僚政治，腐化份子，異端邪說，一旦勝利，便是正義公道的末日。因此人類必須爲信仰而戰爭。這是光榮，這是人類的悲劇，也是偉大藝術的結晶。</p>
<p>這書文筆的　利，感情的深刻，堪與英國大文豪吉百齡匹敵，目下銷數已達七十萬册。因爲它對於讀者的印象太深刻了，取材雖在西班牙一隅。所叙却是全人類可歌可泣的至情。</p>
<p>總之，赫明威寫下這本傑作，認明他是個天才的戰爭文豪，他需要一次正義的戰爭來賦與他藝術以無上的莊嚴。</p>
<p>赫明威是個魁梧結實的人，擅長打獵和捕魚。他並且是個第一流的記者，雖不願高談　論，但興緻到來時，也會談笑風生，口若懸河。他曾在巴黎。馬德里及美國數十處城市，從事寫作生活。他結婚過兩决，生有一個兒子，前月偕其夫人在兩粵前綫視察，現在已到達車慶了。（已於本月六日由桂飛渝）</p>
<p>赫明威著作一覽表：「詩與小說」（一九二三年）。「我們的時代」（一九二四年）。「春潮及「旭日之升」（一九二六年）。「衆陽無陰」（一九二七年）。「吿別戰爭」（一九二九年）。「午後的死亡」（一九三二年）。「勝利者的失望」（一九三三年）。「菲洲蔥嶺記」（一九三五年）。「貧窮與富有」（一九三七年）。「第五縱隊」（一九三八年）。「西班牙大地」及「號角鼓聲」（一九叫〇年）。『一九三一年以前作品』有全集出版。（完）</p>

<p>辯護律師　要求釋放</p>
<p>愛高之律師普萊梅已申請法海軍當局准其會見當事人、俾能準備為之辯護不久可望如願、據普氐表示、愛高若被解赴西貢受審、渠願同往辯護、昨日（七日）普氏並巳致函法海軍當局、援引法律、指明軍事當局派員擅入比僑房產、拘捕愛高、於法不合、故要求立即予以開釋、</p>
<p>法當局對　此案說明</p>
<p>哈瓦斯世界電訊社本埠消息、本埠法國商人愛高、因牽涉逃亡案、被法國駐滬海軍當局援引海軍法加以逮捕後、此間法當局恐外界對於此案發生誤會、爰特商得領事當局同意、授權哈瓦斯世界電訊社、就法國現行法律、作如下之說明、</p>
<p>煽動逃亡　觸犯軍法</p>
<p>（一）查此案觸犯一九三八年一月十三日所頒佈之海軍法第二百零三條（即煽動逃亡罪）、應由海軍法庭負責審理、（關於此點　同法第一百五十二條·第一百八十一條·及第二百零三條、均有同樣之規定、）（二）海軍法規定處理此類案件、應分調查檢察審判三個階段、凡在法國本部以外發生之案件、係由海軍軍官一員、負責調查、此一軍官在商得當地領事完全同意後、得以採取任何適當步驟、以進行其調查工作、檢察官亦應由海軍軍官擔任、有權決定被吿應吾拘押或許其恢復自由、一俟檢察官審查完畢、認為無罪、即可宣吿結束、吾則當將被吿解往海軍法庭受鞫、（三）海軍法第一百七十八條規定、海軍法庭依據同法第一百五十二條所宜佈之判決、受判者在戰事期內、無論如何、不得請求廢止、</p>

<p>阿樂滿氏　反對出售</p>
<p>工部局美董阿樂滿反對會所出售甚力、據稱、渠爲情感上與經濟上兩大原因、加以反對、以情感上原因言、美國總會乃半公共性質之美僑機關、縱有出售必要、目下亦非其時、若在此際考慮出售、皆因以上海或將沉淪爲慮所致、但渠深信不致有此一日、以經濟上原因言、買主若無良好理由、不致出價二白萬元以上、且就收支賬目觀之、總會在財務上並無重大困難、可見主張出售者、實因對將來有所憂慮使然、</p>
<p>贊成方面　所持理由</p>
<p>又工部局前總董美律師樊克令謂、買方出價、若與福州路房產價値相等、　即不加反對云、南星顏料廠經理費士德則贊成出售、據稱、美國在東方之令譽、不致因此房產之出售而梢受損害、</p>
<p>著名美僑　慨乎言之</p>
<p>本埠某著名美籍律師、昨日對記者稱、渠反對出售福州路會址、係由於情感與經濟之原因、如上海發生陸沈、則渠願見美僑協會與上海俱沈、渠將永久居於上海、雅不願出以俯首赧顏之態、路經該會會所之前、以此時若將會所售去、將來每一美僑均將有此感覺也、又稱、根據情感之理由、目下出售會所、最爲不智、個人或公司固不妨隨意處置其產業、但美僑協會至少爲一半公衆之機關、一如哥倫比亞總會、美童公學及美國敎堂者然、至於經消方面、會中負債約爲一百萬元、而會產之價値、則當在二百萬元以上也、渠指出以前有人出價美金三萬五千元而未成交、當時會中經濟確甚拮据、而會所中未租出之空屋亦甚多、尙不出售、今再有此議、更爲不智、</p>

<p>搶米一瞥</p>
<p>前日下午五時許、跑馬廳路發生一搶米案、茲據大通社記者探悉詳情如决、有七浦路源盛協記米號、送米一塌車、計十袋、至同孚路順泰久記號交貨、途經跑馬廳路畔、該處候有飢民三四十人、見米經過、即蜂擁上前、袖出利刃、將米袋劃破、米遂下漏、衆用衣襟或粉袋盛裹而去、老司務奮力抵抗、無效、待附近値差之二九號華捕得報趕至、搶米者巳四散、僅將後來分殘餘者二人、追至馬霍路拿獲、的計損失白米三包、</p>

<h3>什麼樣預備日常功課（）</h3>
<p>— 盧紹稷</p>
<p>三·預備功課在方法</p>
<p>靑年學生預備日常功課、欲求其有良好的效果、則除具備上述幾種條件外、應更注意下面幾點、</p>
<p>（一）時地分配須適宜每個靑年應當按照自己能力、排定每日詳細工作的時間表、如何時到敎室上課、何時在房間預備功課、何時用膳、何時起身、何時就寢、一一列入表中、又預習某門功課、每次所需要時間的多少、或一定在什麼時候才轉到下課去、也要大概的規定、這樣、才能免除那些「不知從何處做起」的困難、靑年預備功課、更須有一定的地方、和一定的時間、是同樣重要、做功課時、必須有一張特定的棹子和一把特定的椅子、常常用爲讀書和心智的工作、那個地方、　是讀書的地方、到了預定的時間、就到那個地方去坐下、那末、就會自然可安心去做事了、</p>
<p>（二）下課後須即預備　預備某科指導的功課、應在該科下課後即行預備、理由、是、甲·在某科下課後、當時尙有學習該科的傾向、似宜因勢利用、乙·預習問題、猶在耳際、丙該科經二次學習、則易於記憶、</p>
<p>（三）開始時須即注意　開始預備功課時、須先將指定敎材、作一全部的涉獵、又須將所做工作認識消楚、堅持着在面前的那一件事、做得愈快愈好、換句話說、當開始工作時、要馬上做去、做到完結爲止、</p>
<p>（四）預備時須專心致志　當開始預備時、固娘用全力、到後來、也須聚精會神、有勇氣、有自信力、不受內心誘惑、更不受外界誘惑、須穩健的向目標進行、並須切實工作、每决最低限度、須能預備一門功課、倘目標難於一時達到、也須分段完成、但有一點須加注意的、就是在劇烈工作後、須休息片刻、使心地空閒、再接做其他工作、</p>
<p>（五）預備時須存心記憶　存心記憶、也爲預備功課時一重要條件、倘僅爲機械的閱覽、而無記憶的決心、則效果必不大、所以讀自已所有書本時、見有重要處、不妨用筆鈎畫、使其顯目、又遇到繁雜讀物時、可作一大綱、以便記憶、</p>
<p>（六）預備時須有興趣「興趣」和「注意」「記憶」、都是有效學習的要素、所以預備功課時、須我尋動機、使對功課發生興趣、倘遇到不歡喜的學科、則必須輔以動機或誘導物、對於興趣的引起、當由担任該科的敎師負責任、</p>
<p>（七）新課和舊課須連貫　預備新課時、對於舊課應作概略的複習、理由、A舊諜已較熟、不難於注意、易為新課預習之出發點、B這種複習、可將對於複習材料的印象深固一次、使以後易於記憶、C這機複習的材料、可以顯出許多和新課接觸之點、換句話說、其功用即在聯絡新舊、而供給學習之一個根本條件、</p>
<p>（八）避免倚賴和敷衍　預備功課時、應破除為敎師工作的觀念、對於國英算等較難的功課、應多費時間特加注意、非至萬不得已時、不求助於人、解答問題時、也不可遇第一决拙折即灰心、應有再試三試的決心、又預備功課時須認淸所為何事、不可隨意敷衍、要明瞭敎師所指定預習的意旨和該科的重要性、</p>
<p>總之、靑年學生預備日常功課的方法、在積極方面、要排定每週功課表、下課後即須預備、開始時即須注意、又預備時、須專心致志、須存心記憶、須有興趣、須和舊課謀聯絡、至在消極方面、須避免敷衍、須避免倚賴性日常的功課、固當這樣預備、就是考試時、也可這樣預備、幷且日常功課、如能預備得很好、那末預備應考、也魷很容易了、</p>

<h3>「異曲同工」</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>異曲同工的妙就妙在「同工」而又「異曲」。</p>
<p>這是一個很好的掩蔽方法：或者憑藉自己的權威勢力；或者憑藉自己的金錢魔力；或者憑　自己的「不可思議」的潛力……於是爲所欲爲，暢所欲爲，一切可爲！</p>
<p>但畢竟「天降大任於斯人也」，旣不能「明刀眞槍」，又不能「千篇一律」；想來想去，算前算　，因此就　出了「異曲」來，「工」當然「半斤八兩」，差不了許多。</p>
<p>而人家驟然視之，非但小以爲「忤」，甚至還要「擊節贊嘆」：『好一個慈善先生啊！』（最好是「唱」。）</p>
<p>爲此，聰明的都爭相「異曲」；祗有戇徒才專彈「老調」。</p>
<p>「異曲」愈彈愈多，也許就應了「物極必反」的道理，人家懷疑了……</p>
<p>所以，異曲同工的不妙也就不妙在「異曲」而又「同工」！</p>
<h3>三好婆買煤球</h3>
<p>— 沉思</p>
<p>一夜的　風雨把「春」趕得無影無踪，而且，隔天的早晨還是淅淅瀝瀝的下着不停的雨。</p>
<p>三好婆的腋下挾着包裹菜籃傘在手裏抖安着，扭揑着小脚，從菜市上向家的路走去。</p>
<p>卡車上，大篾簍裏儘堆着煤屑，一簍簍，有那麽一三十簍吧，堆得高高的，一輛輛在她的身傍　過；遮在煤簍上的大油布，絆過風的捲動，像燙髮姑娘的髮辮那樣飛舞起來，發出「啪啪啪」的聲音。</p>
<p>這引起了三好婆的注意，也勾起了她的家務心事，她想：『煤球怕又要漲價了吧，要末預　叫一擔好防防。』</p>
<p>她自語着，艱難地走到了煤炭店門前，向裏向偷偷地張望一下，「嘿！」她心裹想，「這許多貨色要値多少錢呀！」煤炭店裏原來把煤球，煤塊，柴爿堆得祇剩一條狹狹的走路道了。三好婆紙知道値錢，却估不出値多少錢。</p>
<p>她嚅囁地問那個　臉烏黑的夥計：</p>
<p>『煤球啥價鈿？』</p>
<p>『十三塊。』</p>
<p>『十三塊？』三好婆心裏別的一跳，『前天不祇有十二塊嗎？』</p>
<p>『今天漲的。』</p>
<p>『哦！哦…』三好婆　了下來，心裹想：『家裏還有上來天好　呢，等等再說吧，也許會跌。唉，這日子……』</p>
<p>這樣，一天蹉跎過去了。</p>
<p>第三天早晨，三好婆挾着菜籃冉經過那家煤炭店門口的時候，她擔心着又上前試試自己的「命運」。</p>
<p>但是……</p>
<p>『十六槐！』</p>
<p>『啊！』三好婆呆住了，『怎麽漲了這麽一大段呀！』</p>
<p>夥計不屑地向三好婆瞪着眼，說：</p>
<p>『漲，嘿！快沒燒了呢，假使外國打起仗來，來路馬上就耍斷絕了。』</p>
<p>『那麽，那麽現在還沒有斷呀！』好婆發急地向那麽夥計憑理。</p>
<p>『你這個女人眞是，』夥計像給誰打了一拳似的，眉頭突然攢緊到了一起，『你不知道煤球廠罷工麽？工人一加工　，叫老闆賺什麽去呀！』</p>
<p>『那麽，那麽他們從前賺</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）愛情結晶品</p>
<p>怎麽沒有！前年我媽死了，還是我自己送她的靈柩到家鄕去的，那就是滄州的東鄕，張開眼請往四野裹瞧，差不多全是綠的東西。」提到家鄕，秋海棠的精神頓時就增加了不少。</p>
<p>「光是田裏種出來的蔬菜，現採現做，就要比大魚大肉好吃得多咧！」</p>
<p>湘綺立刻從床上站了起來，顯然也很興奮的樣子。</p>
<p>「滄州雖然略近一些，但旣然是鄉下，想必還不致就會給他們找到的。只是袁紹文前年有沒有和你同到那邊去呢？」</p>
<p>「沒有，因為我那邊根本沒有家了。」</p>
<p>「那末還有什麽人呢？」</p>
<p>「有一房叔父和幾個堂姨妹幾個堂兄弟，都是莊稼人，挺老實的。」秋海棠不斷的撫摩着自已的雙手，覺得這一雙手嫩果然保持得很嫩了，細膩也並不輸如一般的婦女，但講起實用來，怎比得上他叔父他堂兄弟他堂姨妹那些人的粗糙得比毛竹還不如的手呢？「跟他們」塊兒過日子，興趣當然耍比現在好得多，不過他們鄕下人胆子未免小些，如果知道了我們的事，一定是不敢收留我們的。」</p>
<p>湘綺更向前走了幾步，衣角已碰到了靠秋海棠右首所按着的一張方桌子。</p>
<p>「我的意思原不是這樣想」，她彎着四個指頭，輕輕地在那桌子上叩了三五下。「一個人想打主意敎別人收留他，根本就不是什麽中意了！天下的事誰能依靠誰呢；所以我們這件事不做便罷，要做就得靠自己……」</p>
<p>秋海棠的嘴脣才微微一動，想挿口進來，湘綺却已繼續很有勁地說下去了。</p>
<p>「你可以先把節下的錢寄一些回去，托你的叔父在附近代買幾畝田地，再蓋上幾間小平房，只說是每年夏天，準備耍到鄉下去歇息一兩個月，這樣他們也就不會再多所猜疑了。一面你還好湊着這個機會，多給你叔父一些錢，使他心裏高興，將來同處一村，多個照應總是好的。」</p>

<h3>一介不取乎</h3>
<p>— 淑英</p>
<p>靠　領吃飯，靠力氣吃飯，靠腦汁吃飯……似乎總沒有「乘火打刦」底旣省力，又多利而來得「爽辣乾脆」。</p>
<p>明白了這一點，於是前要撈，後要撈，上下要撈。而嘴角上老掛着的「如有舞弊，天誅地滅」兩句誓言，第一决用得着，第二决用得着，第三决還是用得着；而且永遠用得着。</p>
<p>孟子曰：「一介不以與人，一介不以取諸人。」固無論孟老夫子在現在是不是「合潮流」，我想這兩句話是儘可以拿放大鏡來照的！</p>
<p>如果萬一照出來不以為然，「天誅地滅」的咒誓也大可不必！吾則眞個應起騐來，豈不糟糕？</p>
<p>我說：祇要自已「天地良心」就得了。……</p>
<h3>筆花</h3>
<p>— 尤作迅</p>
<p>肯做「苦」工，即無「苦」境；能學「好」樣，即是「好」人。</p>
<p>惡友不可交，因其「絕交」之難，猶新毛筆染以墨汁，任何方法不能洗盡一樣。</p>
<p>知過而改，固是美德，然猶壁上鐵釘，即使拔除，其痕跡永存。</p>
<p>前途果然遼遠黑暗，然而不要害怕，在無畏者前面永久有光明康道。得很多了呀！」</p>
<p>伙夥不理三好婆了，「合罕，合罕」地　開了。</p>
<p>『唉！』三好婆埋怨起自己來了，『爲什麽我大問他這些不相干的事呢？這種事我父哪裏緾得淸呢？我的天哪，究竟要不要買一擔呢？』</p>
<p>三好婆想起了自己的孩子，三十歲，唔，三十歲，可是老得像三十六七的人了，尤其是三年來，唉，老是咳嗽。三好婆勸他買點什麽使宜的補品吃吃，但是，唉，但是百來隻老洋要養活一個娘，養活一個妻子，養活一個剛滿周歲的小娃娃，不借債已經够幸運的了，那兒有錢……</p>
<p>『爲什麼又要想這些呢？』鼻管酸在汪地，三好婆險乎滴出了老淚來，『要不要買一擔啊？……啊，……買一擔吧，唉！阿順給我買菱角枕頭的錢用了再說吧，死了橫豎我看不見了！』</p>

<h3>談上海幾個猴子</h3>
<p>— 曉</p>
<p>北　以演猴戲出名的，張洪林以後為楊小樓，及崑弋班中的郝振基　後輩中葉盛章，李萬春，李少春，李盛斌，李盛佐，劉鳳奎，梁慧超，張雲溪，都擅畏猴戲，但是藝術和火候，却不如楊小樓郝振基。小樓的猴戲很少有猴子氣，老郝的猴王是太像猢猻形，楊伶說：「悟空雖也是猴子，可是要脫形，偶然有猴相可以，一輩裝猢猻腔，成了小猢猻，不像孫悟空。」所以楊小樓的猴戲沒有猢猻腔，可是名氣却非常大，因為他的面部，身材，四肢，已經够像猴子了。郝振基除了面上動作，二手使用，二足按放，活像猴子以外，就沒有特長了。內行評價不及小樓。</p>
<p>南方猴戲一向不大注重，當年賽活猴（鄭長泰）雖善演猴戲，可是並不出名。其子小活猴（鄭法祥）也是個中好手，此人極修私德，早年頗為黃金榮氏所重視，特地造一戲院，取名齊天舞臺（今之共舞臺），邀他主演「西遊記」，當時着實轟動一時。近十年來，頗不得志，一度在大蟾唱中塲戲，可是他却極珍矜猴子戲，在進臺之前，以不演猴戲為先提，戲碼前後可以隨便（泗州城例外），近隸大新公司　京班主演「西遊記」，英雄未遇，太可惜了。有徒曰小小活猴，爲牛松山之孫，牛小山之子，楊小樓李萬春之「夜奔」，就是牛家父子所傳的。牛家的武小生戲很出名，所以小小活猴的「八大鎚」非常出色。武丑戲，關戲，都是家傳，猴戲得鄭法祥指正，數年來奔走贛渝，尙負薄譽，新正進先施樂園，不久上天津，最近由天津回來應新世界當局之的，任大京班臺柱。</p>
<p>蓋叫天曾在共舞臺主演「西遊記」，他的猴戲與衆不同，注重眞功夫，像駱駝背上彈琵琶，一手彈琵琶，一手耍鞭，一隻脚還能舞圈。學他的有王桂卿。桂卿拜過蓋叫天爲師，在大世界演過「西遊記」，繼張翼鵬之後，進大舞臺補翼鵬缺，繼續排「西遊記」，藝也很不錯。張翼鵬是蓋叫天長子，他就是唱「西遊記」紅出來的，在大舞臺前後四五年，就靠「西遊記」一本戲。翼鵬的猴子是偏重於猴的小動作：抓首，弄眉，聳肩，縮腿，和進塲出塲的舉止，眞是一隻猢猻。</p>
<p>郭坤泉是伶工世家，祖郭秀華，父郭蝶仙，都是當年名伶。童年藝名郭張揚，短打長靠，都有根底，「伐子都」「界牌關」二劇，可以稱雄於南北，因為身材矮小，嗓子沙啞，淪落在遊藝塲，怪可惜的。我曾觀其猴戲「金刀陣」，是宗鄭法祥的，手，眼，耳，法，步，都好。最難能的在桌上連人帶椅翻下端坐臺口，地位準足，姿勢美妙，沒有見過第二人。</p>
<p>此外如張韻樓，高雪樵，李仲林，賈斌侯，袁小樓，都演過「西遊記」。張韻樓是在老更新；高雪樵是替蓋叫天在共舞臺；李仲林在新世界演「西遊記」，名字還叫小小桂兀，那時候他還能唱老生戲，我在杜祠堂會上還聽通他的「羣臣宴」呢。</p>

<p>助奏是有兩位音樂家，一位影星，一個歌詠團。梅也敎授的小提琴獨奏和盲音樂家吳少榮的鋼琴獨奏，都表演了技術上的深高的修養。白　的獨唱非常受人歡迎，用口琴隊來伴奏也是頗為有趣的事。</p>

<h3>Initial Victory of the Southern Armies: Occupies Three Important Seaports in Italian Territory; German Forces Launch Blitzkrieg in Northern Greece; Greek Army Withdraws from Thrace Due to Strategic Considerations</h3>
<p>London – It is rumored that Yugoslavian troops have penetrated the borders of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania with lightning speed, but this has not yet been confirmed. According to sources in Xiongcheng (likely a transliteration of a foreign city), the Southern armies are currently exerting heavy pressure on Italian forces who are putting up strong resistance in the mountains northeast of Scutari in Albania. It is reported that Greek forces have been staunchly resisting the powerful German offensive in the Struma River basin and the surrounding highlands. German forces are using tanks, heavy artillery, and bombers. Two Greek fortifications in the Struma area have been destroyed by artillery fire after fierce resistance. Furthermore, a Xiongcheng dispatch states that Italian forces are awaiting German assistance. When the Italian forces retreated from Zara on the Dalmatian coast, they abandoned a large quantity of military supplies. Considering the vast operational range of the Yugoslavian air force, the number of pilots and aircraft lost is remarkably small. It is rumored that the Southern armies entered Scutari on Sunday. Other dispatches indicate that Fiume in northeastern Italy has been occupied by the Southern armies. A Greek communiqué stated that strong positions have been occupied on the Albanian front, and 500 enemy soldiers and a large quantity of military supplies have been captured. Meanwhile, a Reuters correspondent stationed in Greece reports that most of the British troops arriving in Greece have been transferred directly from the Libyan battlefield, fully equipped and ready for combat anywhere. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>New York – Columbia Broadcasting Company broadcast news from Tokyo stating that the Southern armies have occupied Fiume (northeastern Italy), Zara (Dalmatian coast bordering southern Italy), and Scutari (Albania). (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London – A broadcast from Ankara was heard here yesterday, stating that the Southern armies have begun a lightning-style offensive against Hungary, capturing the Italian port of Zara and Scutari in Albania. The report regarding the Southern armies occupying the port of Zara has not yet been confirmed. The Southern armies' blitzkrieg against Hungary is advancing towards Zagreb. Scutari is located in Albania, 20 miles from the Adriatic coast. The Ankara broadcast essentially indicated that the Southern armies are attempting to drive the Italian forces into a trap formed by the Greek southern army and the British naval forces along the coast. It also stated that the Southern armies have begun a large-scale offensive against the Italian forces on the Albanian border. The radio station also stated that the Southern armies first bombarded with heavy artillery before attacking Albanian territory. The station further reported that the Southern armies have opened fire on the border between the two countries of Southern and Albanian, in preparation for an invasion of Albania. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>New York – Columbia Broadcasting Company received a broadcast from Ankara last night stating, according to confirmed sources, that Yugoslavian troops have occupied the Italian seaport of Fiume on the northwest coast of the Southern nation. Fiume was ceded to Italy in 1924 after a fierce dispute through the efforts of the famous Italian poet and soldier Gabriele D'Annunzio. Yugoslavia recognized the cession by treaty on April 5, 1925, and granted Hungary the right to use Fiume as a free port. Fiume is located on the Adriatic Sea, where Yugoslavia borders Italy. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The Greek observation line on the Greek-Bulgarian border was captured by German stormtroopers at dawn on the 6th. Although the Greek forces offered some resistance, they were defeated by the German forces, and the first trench fell. German aircraft heavily bombed the area, shaking the mountains. Most of the observation posts were destroyed by bombs. The Greek forces continuously returned fire with machine guns, but the German troops bravely charged and are believed to have occupied the Greek observation posts one by one. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>New York – According to broadcasts heard here last night by NBC, German forces have advanced from Eastern Thrace to the Aegean coast, forming a wedge between Greece and Turkey, thus separating them. German forces have occupied the border region in eastern Greece bordering Turkey, thus cutting off the only point of contact between Turkey and the Greek mainland. We can now realize that if Turkey wants to assist Greece, it must be prepared to attack the German forces on this Turkish-Greek border. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Athens – An official war communiqué recently announced that Greek artillery has frequently fired heavy shells across the important Rupel Pass, repelling repeated attacks by hundreds of German tanks, which were advancing under the cover of low-flying bombers. However, the low-flying aircraft guarding the tanks were also forced back by intense anti-aircraft fire. Even though German forces concentrated artillery fire, aircraft, and tanks to launch vicious attacks, the Greek forces have stopped the German forces in the most important areas. However, Greek forces in western Thrace have withdrawn due to strategic considerations. As the Greek artillery fired shell after shell, fiercely bombarding these seemingly terrifying monster German tanks, and the teams holding all the main fortresses, many German tanks have been destroyed. The communiqué also stated that the Greek forces on the Albanian front are still advancing. However, the Greek forces on the Thracian front have retreated for military reasons and to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The area of retreat is now guarded by small detachments of Greek troops. On the Albanian front, the Greek forces adopted a strong offensive and occupied several important positions of the Italian forces, capturing 500 Italian soldiers. All the supplies abandoned by the Italian forces were captured by the Greek forces. The communiqué also stated that two fortresses in western Thrace, named Ischino and Nefeia, are still resisting the enemy and preventing their entry. Furthermore, the German forces attacked Lisborg on the Greek-Bulgarian border west of Macedonia, with tanks assisting in the battle, but they were repelled by the Greek forces, and many of their tanks were destroyed. On the heights of Navrokopp, the enemy forces entered the fortress of Beritoli after a strenuous attack. However, after a fierce battle in the tunnels, most of the German soldiers who entered the fortress were annihilated, and the fortress remained in the hands of the Greek forces. In the Struma Valley, the garrisons in the two fortresses of Istinbe and Karkal fought until only one person remained. The two fortresses were then destroyed. Lupel, Akisia, and Laven were attacked several times by tanks and aircraft, but intense artillery fire finally repelled the enemy forces. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>150,000 German Troops Launch Large-Scale Invasion of Greece: Bloody Battle Unfolds at Rupel Pass</h3>
<p>Zurich – There was a major battle at the Rupel Pass in northern Greece last night. 150,000 German troops concentrated in one place, carrying out Hitler's blitzkrieg. British air force heavily bombed the German troops on the mountain road and engaged the German air force in battle, vying for control of the airspace over the mountain pass. The German army admitted that the Greek army's resistance was very strong. Another 150,000 German troops attacked Yugoslavia from the two countries of Bulgaria and Romania. A third group of 300,000 German troops attacked the Southern nation from the northern border. Italian forces also dispatched 100,000 troops from Italy southward to attack the northern border of the Southern nation. The Allied forces resisting the German army in all directions totaled approximately 2 million people, including 1 million from the Southern army, 80,000 from the Greek army, and 100,000 to 300,000 from the British army. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Athens – News from the Greek-Bulgarian border last night stated that although the German Nazi army launched a large-scale invasion, it has not yet broken through the Greek army's defense line. It is believed that the Yugoslavian army is also resisting the German army's attack. Unconfirmed news stated that the Yugoslavian army captured more than a dozen German tanks. Military observers believe that the general living situation is still satisfactory. The high command also broadcast an announcement on Greek radio, stating that the Greek army is holding its position on the Bulgarian front, but the fortresses of Ishtiba and another one in the Struma River basin have been occupied by the German army. The German army launched a fierce attack on the Rupel Pass but has been repelled. The German army once rushed into the Thilidor of Nivipinosantou, but "after struggling within the fortress, the Thilidor was wiped out, and the fortress returned to Greek control." It also stated that on the same day, a large German army launched a frontal attack on the Struma River and Ryu Ken, and fierce battles were launched on the peaks of Niviro Kopp. It was also stated that countless German tanks attacked Lispa Fort, but many were destroyed by the Greek artillery. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Greek Suicide Squad Fights Against Overwhelming Odds: Entire Unit Sacrifices Themselves on Greek-Bulgarian Front</h3>
<p>London – According to a dispatch from a Reuters special correspondent with the British army in Greece, details of how a Greek suicide squad of 150 men, led by a corporal, fought against 20 times as many German troops, resulting in the sacrifice of the entire unit, were released today. This small number of Greek soldiers blocked the German army from breaking through the most important part of the Greek-Bulgarian front. It is said that when the German army launched a full-scale attack, the Greek commander called for a suicide squad to remain at the front and hold a mountain ridge with all their might, so that the main force could calmly transfer to pre-arranged positions in the rear. All the soldiers eagerly participated, and the corporal selected 150 men. After being selected, they set off, first destroying a bridge and destroying several enemy tanks, then, with extraordinary courage, holding the front positions to resist the enemy's fierce slaughter. They fell one after another until the entire unit was killed. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>German Use of Paratroopers Encountered Failure: All Captured in Macedonian Region</h3>
<p>Athens – A Greek official spokesperson stated last night that on Sunday, German planes carrying paratroopers and leaflets flew to Macedonia to drop them. Some of the paratroopers have been captured. The leaflets dropped by the German planes proclaimed that "Germany is friendly to the Greek people, so we hope the Greeks will not suffer the horrors of war." The spokesperson also stated that the main German offensive was in the areas of Beers and along the Struma River basin. While the Greek army was resisting another invasion, multiple German divisions used various modern mechanized military equipment to attack the Greek army from the rear, starting from Beers along the entire border, but did not succeed in breaking through. The Greek soldiers on the front line resisted fierce artillery fire, destroyed invading tanks, and launched a counter-offensive. Greek aircraft shot down six German aircraft, with no losses for the Greek aircraft. The Italian forces in Albania did not engage in any activity, apparently intending to reap the benefits of others. Athens Radio broadcast a Greek military headquarters communiqué last night stating that the German offensive continues unabated, and small Greek teams are adding resistance. The people of western Selos are currently withdrawing as usual. Greek forces on the Albanian front continue to attack, capturing 500 enemies. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Military Cooperation Between Britain and Turkey: Turkey Allows Britain to Use Its Territory as Air Force Base</h3>
<p>Istanbul – Britain has indicated that Turkey may soon declare war, but will not take offensive action. Well-informed sources say that a large amount of British military supplies have recently arrived in Turkey. Britain claims that Turkey will take a defensive stance militarily, but will allow Britain to use Turkish territory, at least as an air force base, and will allow British ships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait to the Black Sea.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The "Blitzkrieg" in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Germany and Italy had no choice but to simultaneously attack the two countries of Southern and Greece with a large amount of force. This move was actually due to the pressure of the current situation, which declared the complete failure of the various machinations, persuasions, and threats they had recently made. This is also admitted by Germany's spokesperson as a situation that its enemies attempted to bring about. What is worthy of world attention is that the Soviet-Southern non-aggression pact was signed on the eve of this war, which shows that this German-Italian action clearly went in the opposite direction to the basic interests of the Soviet Union and its desire to maintain peace in the Balkans. This is what the German-Italian side has always tried to avoid, and what the British and Greek nations now feel comforted by. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Balkan War, two unfavorable new situations immediately appeared in front of Germany and Italy: First, the German-Italian group will have to fight on both the eastern and western fronts of Europe at the same time in the future; second, the existing friendly relationship between the Soviet Union and the Southern nation has gradually become strained. If the war is prolonged, the possible adverse effects on Germany and Italy in the future development will be unimaginable. For Germany and Italy, the supreme strategy of this Balkan gamble should be to resort to the so-called "blitzkrieg tactics." General observations in the past two days have also believed that their greatest attempt now is to replay the Polish campaign two years ago.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Polish campaign, the first step of the invading army was to bomb transportation hubs, industrial areas, and densely populated cities on a large scale, so that the entire territory of Poland immediately fell into chaos. Secondly, it immediately launched a three-sided encirclement of it, and launched a fierce attack to break through the defense line along many routes at the same time. As a result, in less than a week, it was found that there were more than a dozen offensive routes, making the Polish defenders overwhelmed, and in less than two weeks, the entire war machine of Poland disintegrated. This dazzling and fierce tactic is still deeply etched in everyone's memory. In this Balkan War, in addition to the brutal bombing of the two countries of Southern and Greece by Germany and Italy for the past two or three days, which has been carried out fiercely; on the land front, at least seven offensive routes have also been discovered, and the situation is almost exactly the same as the above-mentioned Polish War. Geographically, Germany and Italy occupy a three-sided encirclement of the two countries of Southern and Greece: In the east, Germany, based on Bulgaria, began to attack along four routes. In the north, it divided into three routes to attack, one based on Romania, two based on Hungary, and three based on Austria. As for the west of the two countries of Southern and Greece, it is under the threat of Italy and Albania, and the long coastal area along the Adriatic Sea, if it is within the reach of Italian forces, can be landed at any time and anywhere.</p>
<p>The battle results of the past three days are not very clear now, and the future victory or defeat is of course unknown at present. According to various reports, Germany is said to have used about 500,000 troops in this battle; while the Yugoslav army is probably around 1 million, and the British troops landed in Greece also reached 600,000. In addition, plus the military strength of Italy and Greece, this is undoubtedly brewing a big war. As for strategy: Germany and Italy absolutely need a quick decision. No matter what the source of the German side's statement that it has abandoned blitzkrieg tactics, Germany and Italy must expect the blitz to be effective and go down in one fell swoop. As for the British, Southern, and Greek Allied forces, it is fundamentally different from the other side. The most important task at present is to stabilize the situation, so as not to repeat the mistakes of Poland. Once the Nazi army's "blitzkrieg" edge is frustrated, the war can gradually enter a prolonged situation. In this way, half of their greatest goal of resisting the war will be achieved. Therefore, it is said that the capital of the Southern nation has moved south, and it is of course necessary for strategic reasons, so as to obtain closer contact with the British and Greek armies. Furthermore, in terms of Greece, the most urgent thing is the land where it connects with Turkey and Britain in terms of the sea and the land, so it must defend the Turkish-Greek border passage and the sea ports at any cost. The most important thing for Yugoslavia is to protect its southern territory bordering Greece, and at the same time try to prevent any landing attempt by Italy, so that it can always maintain contact with the British army from the sea and receive supplies from the United States. Therefore, the significance of the Southern army's offensive yesterday to attack the free city of Fiume, Italian-owned Zara, and Scutari in Albania at the same time lies in this.</p>
<p>The basic weakness of Germany and Italy's strategy in this Balkan War is that, first, they were not prepared for this war on the Balkan Peninsula, especially against Yugoslavia; second, the blitzkrieg is no longer the latest strategy, and the other side has experience in dealing with it. Even in terms of "blitzkrieg," there are three major obstacles: First, the dispersion of German and Italian military forces. In addition to defending the 2,000-mile coastline along the northwest coast and the eastern border with the Soviet Union, they must also garrison defense troops in the conquered areas. It is now almost impossible to concentrate large-scale troops for a fierce attack like against Poland. Second, geographically, the mountainous areas of Southern and Greece are different from the western plains of Poland. And the most important third obstacle is that the British Navy almost completely controls the seas of the two countries of Southern and Greece, so that supplies can be continuously increased. According to what British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Cunninghame said not long ago, the Italian fleet suffered losses in the two major battles in Toranto and the Ionian Sea, plus other small contacts. Two-thirds of the battleships are gone, and more than 50% of the cruisers and destroyers are lost, and the submarine losses are 20% to 30%. Under the absolute advantage of the British fleet, Germany and Italy will find it difficult to put the two countries of Southern and Greece in the same predicament of foreign aid being cut off as Poland.</p>
<p>Finally, it must also be pointed out that the air force strength of the British, Greek, and Southern sides, with unlimited supplies from the United States, is by no means comparable to Poland more than two years ago. Judging from the above, the possibility of Germany and Italy's blitzkrieg tactics succeeding in this battle is very slim.</p>
<h3>Greek-Southern Border Will Become Major Battlefield, Terrain More Dangerous to German Forces</h3>
<p>London – Today's news from Istanbul states that the section where German troops pass through Thrace to the Aegean Sea is enough to show that German troops have formed a wedge between Greece and Turkey to prevent any reinforcements from the sea for Greece and Yugoslavia. The Germans may also launch a flank attack on the Greek forces fighting in the Struma River basin and the Navrokopp highlands. This side attack must follow the railway from Sande to Darama and Sears to progress, but we dare to believe that the British-Greek high command must have foreseen this threat and have full preparation. The main war is in the Navrokopp Plateau and the Struma River basin, and the war in Mount Ruppel is of great importance. Thessaloniki is at least the object of these wars, but even if the Germans actually cross Mount Ruppel and enter the plains of the Struma River basin, its difficulties cannot be said to be over, because the terrain of the road to Thessaloniki suddenly rises to more than three thousand feet, and on this kind of terrain that has become a natural barrier, Greek troops can also deploy defenses to reject the German army, and the German transport line passing through the Lugel Pass is also afraid that it will be frequently bombed by the Allied forces. Military personnel here all unanimously believe that the German offensive against Yugoslavia seems to focus on Skopje, the main transportation center. If it is occupied by the German army, the contact between southern Yugoslavia and the rest of the country will be severed. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Southern Army Forced to Withdraw from Southern Servia, Causing Greek Army Left Flank to Lose Cover</h3>
<p>Athens – The Yugoslavian army in southern Servia is withdrawing under great pressure, causing the Greek army's left flank to lose cover. The Greek army is currently fighting hard to make up for this gap. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Capital of Syria – According to telegraphic dispatches received here, the Northern Army of Yugoslavia is withdrawing to the Sava River according to plan. Although there are as many as twelve divisions of German troops concentrated in Bulgaria, they cannot all be used to attack the Southern nation, because the Greek government has concentrated troops in the Maritza River area in the eastern end of the Thracian region. The German army must allocate some troops to pay attention to the war on this front. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Southern Capital Bombed Five Times, British Planes Heavily Bomb Bulgarian Capital in Retaliation</h3>

The dive bombers attacked the Grattisk Train Station and the railway near Novisad leading to Zagreb, the important town of Krott, destroying a train station and two trains. As for the Belgrade Central Railway Station, it has been completely destroyed by bombing, and countless military buildings have caught fire. Among the aircraft parked at the Topola Airfield, 14 were destroyed. At the Urosevac Airfield, 12 were destroyed. At the Pristina Airfield, 6 were destroyed by machine guns. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>London – After German aircraft bombed the Southern capital, the British Air Force quickly responded and bombed the German troops concentrated in the Bulgarian capital on Sunday night. The train stations, railway intersections, warehouses, and motor transport vehicles in the area were heavily attacked, and explosions and fires occurred in many places. A certain truck was blown into the sky by the bomb. After the British aircraft finished bombing, they flew back to the Struma River basin and made diving sweeps of targets and heavily damaged motor transport vehicles. All the attacking British aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. News from the Axis side stated that Southern aircraft bombed several towns in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. The Hungarian side said that ten Southern aircraft attacking places like Schietin "and attempting to attack the Hungarian capital" were shot down. The Bulgarian Air Force issued a communiqué declaring that "the two undefended cities of the Bulgarian capital and Kostandil" were attacked. Telegrams from Rome also stated that Southern aircraft had attacked at least three cities in the western part of Vienna: Dussoffa, Arad, and Timisoara. News from the Axis side also stated that the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania had protested to the Southern nation. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>China Expresses Deep Sympathy for Greece and Yugoslavia's Resistance; Japan Closely Monitors European Developments, Says Implementing the Alliance Is Not Yet Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Chongqing  Local newspapers here are paying close attention to the developments in the Balkans, and express deep sympathy for Greece and Yugoslavia. "Central Daily News" stated that Germany's invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia is not as easy as the invasion of France. There is no doubt about France's internal divisions, while Greece is united. Yugoslavia also has the hope of unity. Now British troops have landed in Greece, the United States has announced full assistance to Greece and Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, knowing that Germany is about to invade Yugoslavia, suddenly concluded a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia, which is noteworthy. Germany's current decision is taking a major risk, and the result may cause a major military change in the European situation. The spirit shown by Greece and Yugoslavia deserves our greatest admiration. We are willing to express sincere sympathy and look forward to their victory. "Saodang News" said that the recent developments in the Balkans are enough to show: (1) The military, political, and economic aggression pressure of Germany cannot be stopped unless it encounters military defeat. (2) All countries realize that compromise or surrender to the aggressor is suicide, and they are determined to fight back. The power of anti-aggression countries has been strengthened as a result. All those who are sacrificed by aggression are encouraged by the resistance of Greece and Yugoslavia. Now they will definitely rise up to resist the aggressors. The resources of the Axis powers are gradually exhausted, and their morale is weakening, especially Italy. The result will be a new development in the European situation. If the Balkan war is prolonged, the collapse of the Axis powers may be accelerated. Whether Japan will take the risk of starting a war with Britain and the United States to help Germany at this turning point in the European situation is what must be decided now. Japan should know that the unity of the anti-aggression forces will make the collapse of the Axis powers inevitable. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo  At the opening of today's meeting of provincial governors, Prime Minister Konoe gave a speech, saying that Japan hopes for an early restoration of international peace. The basis of Japan's diplomacy is the Tripartite Pact, which goes without saying. Japan aims to strengthen cooperation with its allies in order to contribute to the restoration of world peace. According to Ishii, a spokesman for the Information Bureau, the Japanese government is very concerned about the new war in the Balkans and is carefully monitoring its development. Japan's economic interests in Yugoslavia are indeed very small, but Japan pays close attention to the political relationship of the new war. Ishii, fearing that reporters would ask questions, preemptively stated that he could not comment on whether Japan would implement the Tripartite Pact in the German-Yugoslav war, because the Japanese government had not yet considered the question. He heard that Germany had not yet notified the Japanese government regarding the implementation of Article 3 of the Pact in the German-Yugoslav war, so the Japanese government had not considered this point. Ishii also said that news from Berlin reported that when Yugoslavia signed the protocol for joining the Tripartite Pact in Vienna on March 25, it guaranteed that Yugoslavia would obtain access to the Aegean Sea under the new European order, including Yugoslavia's sovereignty over Thessaloniki and the harbor. He knew nothing about this. Foreign Minister Matsuoka had no real information about this matter. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Soviet-Yugoslav Non-Aggression Pact: The Nazi Desire to Dominate Europe Will Sooner or Later Be Opposed by the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>New York  The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia a few hours before Germany invaded Yugoslavia. It had previously blamed the Bulgarian government for allowing German troops to enter Bulgaria. All these facts should be regarded by Hitler as the beginning of Slavic provocation in the Balkans. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany is gradually returning to the hostility between Frost Somren and the Romanovs. Hitler's desire to dominate Europe will sooner or later be opposed by the Soviet Union. Stalin's expression of dissatisfaction with Bulgaria was expected, but it was still thought that he would send a secret diplomatic note, and he would never have expected him to make a public protest. The pact he signed with Yugoslavia was even more important. Stalin's attitude is based on the Soviet Union's opposition to the spread of war, but when the war expanded to Greece and Germany attacked Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the Soviet Union did not publicly criticize it. Stalin's dissatisfaction lies in the expansion of the war. The Soviet Union seems to be paying attention to Asia Minor and the Balkans. The general opinion is that the Soviet Union cannot fight Germany at this time, but if the war continues for another year, this situation may change. (Associated Press dispatch from the 8th)</p>

<h3>British Forces in Libya Continue to Retreat East of Benghazi; British General to Establish Military Government in Abyssinia Due to Chaotic Situation There</h3>
<p>Cairo - Official reports state that the vanguard of British forces in Libya continues to face pressure from the German-Italian armies and is currently retreating to designated areas for concentration. Simultaneously, the British siege of Massawa in Eritrea is progressing, while British forces continue to advance smoothly toward Taishi and Yeda, capturing over 10,000 enemy soldiers and seizing a large amount of war equipment since March 25th. The city of Taipilamakesi in Abyssinia (approximately 90 miles northwest of the Abyssinian capital) is now under British control. Patriotic Abyssinian forces, who played a major role in capturing the city, have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, with over a thousand killed or wounded. The enemy is retreating southward and being pursued by British forces. British forces have also seized a large amount of war equipment in this area. Following the occupation of the Abyssinian capital, battles are now taking place on the northwest, south, and other fronts. A British spokesperson stated yesterday that British forces are retreating east of Benghazi in an orderly manner, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack. British forces are currently in contact with the enemy east of Benghazi, but the situation in that area remains unclear. It is reported that in Massawa, Eritrea, East Africa, the Italian commander, after consulting with British representatives, refused to accept the British surrender terms. British and Free French forces are now attacking the port, with many believing that the Italians are merely stalling for time to carry out sabotage, especially the destruction of port facilities. In Abyssinia, after the Italian forces in Taipilamakesi abandoned the city following the defection of Abyssinian leader Hailu and his troops to the British, the strength of the patriotic Abyssinian forces around the Abyssinian capital is expected to increase rapidly. In Tigray Province, several thousand troops led by Abyssinian Sain have also surrendered to British forces after the fall of Asmara. Generally speaking, Asmara is now completely controlled by British forces. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

British Far East Commander-in-Chief Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, who held talks with senior American naval and military officers here last week, has not yet returned from Hong Kong. He has been delayed and may arrive here tomorrow. U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre will host the Dutch Foreign Minister tonight, and U.S. Army officers will also participate in the banquet. However, U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hart is not scheduled to attend, indicating that it is not related to the Pacific talks and is merely a social function. The Dutch Foreign Minister is here to discuss general defense plans for the Pacific. The meeting is a tripartite conference, as Far East defense leaders from both Britain and the United States will also participate. Initial plans were drafted last week when Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham met with Admiral Hart and U.S. military leaders in the Far East in the Philippines. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Presents This Year's Budget to the House of Commons; Total Expenditure Reaches 4 Billion Pounds; Income Tax and Other Taxes Insufficient to Cover It</h3>
<p>London - British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kingsley Wood presented this year's annual budget to the House of Commons yesterday, stating that the measures he proposed would not only enable Britain to sustain its current difficulties but also maintain a solid foundation for national finances, allowing for postwar reconstruction and social improvement plans in the future. British financial stability has been strong, and the steps taken to encourage exports and reduce non-essential imports have proven effective. Britain's foreign exchange control system and the requisition of U.S. dollar securities have enabled Britain to meet large-scale dollar needs. Now that the United States has backed Britain with the Lend-Lease Act, Britain has a guarantee of purchasing from the United States without difficulty and without hindering its combat capabilities. Britain's control over domestic capital mobilization has been extremely valuable, enabling the government to raise bonds on very favorable terms, with interest rates averaging below 2%. In the future, even as the war continues, it is not intended to raise bonds at high interest rates. We also hope to obtain even better bond terms, all of which are intended to alleviate the postwar financial difficulties arising from war debt and to facilitate the financing of postwar urban reconstruction. This war is the most expensive war in history, resulting in unprecedented difficulties of all kinds. We have found ways to prevent war profiteering. What we must control is the danger of excessive purchasing power surging due to government wartime spending. If we do not absorb excessive purchasing power through taxes to control its impact, this problem will be unsolvable. The government's strict financial plans have largely avoided the adverse effects of unrestricted inflation, and the danger of inflation has not yet occurred in British finance. The estimated revenue and expenditure for this fiscal year are as follows:</p>
<p>Total expenditure is £4,207,000,000. Revenue includes £605,000,000 from income tax (an increase of £81,000,000), £80,000,000 from surtax, £82,000,000 from estate tax, £14,000,000 from stamp duty, and £220,000,000 from excess profits tax, totaling £992,000,000 from domestic taxes. Customs duties are £578,000,000, and purchase tax is £70,000,000, totaling £1,636,000,000. What is expected of the public now is to minimize personal expenses and increase lending to the nation. Income tax is basically increased from 8 shillings and 6 pence per pound to 10 shillings per pound, an increase of 1 shilling and 6 pence. There are flexible measures for those with low incomes, while those with high incomes will be taxed more heavily. Thus, a married man will be taxed 45 shillings per week. Those who did not pay income tax last year will now have to pay 2 shillings per week, but the amount paid will be credited to their account at the Post Office Savings Bank and refunded after the war. As for those with very high incomes, they will have to pay 19 shillings and 6 pence per pound in income tax and surtax, leaving them with only 6 pence per pound for personal use. An individual must have a gross income of £66,000 to have a net income of £5,000, but today there are very few with such a large income. A married man with two children earning £350 per year paid only £5, 8 shillings and 4 pence last year, but under this year's new budget, he will have to pay £24, 7 shillings and 6 pence in income tax, an increase of about £19, but he can receive £47, 6 shillings and 8 pence after the war. The more taxes paid, the less will be recovered after the war. Thus, a married man with two children earning £1,000 per year now has to pay £300 in income tax (an increase of £90), but only £48 will be credited to the savings account. The total estimated income tax revenue for this fiscal year is £605,000,000. Last year's actual income tax revenue was £524,000,000, a record high, exceeding the original budget by £13,000,000. The excess profits tax remains at 100%. This tax is intended to absorb profits made from the war, preventing the increased industrial output caused by the war from becoming a shortcut for personal wealth at a time when the entire nation must sacrifice, as was the case during the last war. However, for the sake of postwar reconstruction, it is proposed that 20% of this 100% excess profits tax be refunded to industries after the war to assist in their postwar reconstruction. The total budget expenditure for this fiscal year is estimated at £4,207,000,000, not including supplies under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act. Last year's expenditure was £3,884,000,000. If overseas expenses for the self-governing dominions, India, etc., are excluded, domestic expenditure is approximately £3,700,000,000. This amount is covered by various tax revenues of £1,636,600,000 and private savings of £1,600,000,000. The shortfall of £500,000,000 will be covered by the new tax rules generating £250,000,000 annually and the new private savings scheme generating over £200,000,000. Domestic expenditure in the first year of the war was £2,058,000,000, in the second year it was £3,190,000,000, and now it has reached £3,700,000,000, demonstrating the continued expansion of Britain's war effort. The reason why the U.S. Lend-Lease Act supplies are not included in the budget is that the British budget is based on cash. The Treasury has a major responsibility to prevent increases in the cost of living. Shipping and insurance costs, etc., will be prevented from increasing. The government will continue and expand its policy of stabilizing prices. Coal prices, gas and electricity prices, and general employment will be maintained as they are, preventing inflation. In addition to announcing income tax, surtax, and excess profits tax measures, the Chancellor of the Exchequer also presented a revised compulsory savings plan by economist Keynes and announced the abolition of the medicine tax from September 2nd, but there were no proposals to increase taxes on tobacco and alcohol. The budget figures presented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer are indeed staggering, but the people have long been prepared to cope with even higher taxes. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka's Stay in the Soviet Union to be Extended</h3>
<p>Moscow - Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka stated yesterday that he may extend his stay in Moscow. He also stated that he does not believe that there are any changes in the Far East situation at present that require him to return to Tokyo. Matsuoka began consultations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday at 4 p.m. (9 p.m. Shanghai time). Before the meeting, Matsuoka stated upon arriving here that he would discuss general issues regarding Soviet-Japanese relations with Molotov. Matsuoka said he was prepared for a longer stay in Moscow. He was originally scheduled to leave Moscow on April 10th, but he will extend his original trip "if extending the visit proves beneficial." At the same time, he learned the full details of the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact when he arrived at the German-Soviet border on Monday. He also said that he believed this treaty would not affect German-Soviet relations. Matsuoka accepted an invitation from the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, to have lunch at the embassy at noon on Monday. Steinhardt passed through Tokyo on his way to the Soviet Union and was entertained by Matsuoka. On Tuesday, he was invited to attend, accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, several of Matsuoka's aides, and U.S. and Japanese embassy staff. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Moscow - On April 7th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov received Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, with Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa also present. (TASS, 8th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka passed through Moscow, and those who greeted him at the station included Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky, officials from the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa, and the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, Hungary, and other countries to the Soviet Union. (TASS, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German official news agency Moscow reports that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka visited the Kremlin yesterday afternoon and met with Stalin and Molotov again. Upon leaving German territory, Matsuoka telegraphed farewells to the German and Italian people, stating briefly, "This trip has strengthened my confidence in the victory of the Axis powers and the successful establishment of a new order." Matsuoka expressed sincere satisfaction with the German and Italian hospitality and thanked Hitler, Mussolini, and the foreign ministers and dignitaries of both countries for their friendship and kindness. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japan Deeply Wary of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Asahi Shimbun commented on the future of German-Soviet relations after the conclusion of the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression treaty, stating that since the Soviet Union's first line of defense is now securing the safety of the Tatar Strait and the mouth of the Danube, the Soviet Union will, to the extent possible, suppress Germany with all its strength. Under the guise of a "policy of peace and neutrality," the Soviet Union is gradually gaining political advantages in the Balkans. Future actions by the Soviet side must be carefully monitored, but German-Soviet relations are not in immediate danger. Kokumin Shimbun raised "suspicions that the Soviet Union and the United States have already reached an agreement" and warned Japan to be wary of future actions by the Soviet Union and the United States.

<h3>Random Thoughts on the European War (43): The Inside Story of Wartime Germany</h3>
<p>In Berlin, the act of flirting with women on the street has suddenly disappeared. This is partly because the blackout makes it difficult for both men and women to see each other clearly, making it hard to make a move. It is also partly because Hitler has taken on the responsibility of protecting the wives of soldiers at the front. One day, a man who swindled 16 marks from the bride of a soldier at the front was sentenced to death and executed.</p>
<p>Even in peacetime, German women's clothing has always been simple and unattractive. But last fall, those who traveled to Germany saw that the clothes they wore were no worse than before. The current clothing ration for German women is 150 points (compared to 100 points last year). This is not enough for them to make a new dress every other year (each dress requires 60 to 85 points), because the remaining points must be saved to buy shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, and gloves. But German tailors are quite capable, and they can turn old clothes from the previous year into a new outfit. Although the Germans have occupied Paris, German women prefer the fashion styles of New York. This fall, I was surrounded by female German friends because they heard that my wife had left six or seven American fashion magazines with me when she visited me in Berlin. They treated them like treasures.</p>
<p>In the eyes of German housewives, the German occupation of France and Belgium is a godsend. They are only allowed to buy six pairs of socks per year, so they had planned to go barefoot in the summer to save socks. But that didn't happen. Last May and June, before the war had ended, millions of pairs of French silk stockings poured directly into Germany. In the cool of autumn, the number of silk stockings purchased by German housewives was the largest in their lives. German soldiers simply used worthless paper marks to buy silk stockings and send them home. The German postal service specially prepared several cargo trucks to deliver packages of goods to the soldiers' wives, daughters, and lovers. In late autumn, I traveled to France and Belgium, and all the shop owners, even in small towns, pointed to the empty shelves and sighed. All the silk stockings, women's underwear, and fragrant soaps, etc., had been completely bought up. The Germans need soap the most. Since the war began, only a kind of soap that looks like rough soap has been sold on the market. That thing is as rough as gravel, like the soap provided in factory washrooms. German women say that while this thing removes dirt, it is very harmful to the skin.</p>
<p>If the war drags on, the clothing problem for Germans will become very serious. All the cotton used in Germany is imported from abroad, and almost no wool is produced domestically. If you want to exchange for a new coat, you must first take your old clothes, and the old clothes must be so tattered that the authorities will agree to exchange them for a new one. German fur is very scarce. Fur must be worn until it is beyond repair before one is eligible to buy new shoes. If a person wants to buy a new set of clothes, they must spend two-thirds of their annual clothing allocation. In this way, they can no longer buy new underwear, socks, shirts, undershirts, handkerchiefs, and gloves. Textiles are also quite scarce in Germany, which even affects the military. Even thick coats cannot be made. At the beginning of the war, the Germans distributed uniforms looted from Czechoslovakia to the engineering corps in the army. Fortunately, these uniforms were modern, and there was no need to bother dyeing them. The so-called "Todt Organization" members, who were forced to work in the front lines, numbered in the hundreds of thousands. They did not wear uniforms. When I saw them on the front lines, these people were only wearing tattered casual clothes. As for the clothes worn by ordinary Germans, they are made of a kind of substitute fiber. 80 million people keep their bodies warm in this way.</p>
<p>The problem of people needing clothes to keep warm was particularly important last winter. At that time, the weather was severely cold, the worst in nearly a century. Most families and offices did not have fires for weeks. When the people get cold, the morale of the people is shaken. Last summer, the government supplied the people with 80% of the coal left over from the previous two winters (which were not severely cold). On the other hand, the people felt the hardship of not having a stove in the winter, so they started storing coal in the summer months. But the government always hopes that God will help, and that the winter will not be too cold, and from summer to autumn, except on Saturdays, the people are forbidden to take hot baths. In the city of Berlin, the only place where you can always get a hot bath is the Adlon Hotel. At that time, tourists were limited to foreigners. Last winter, my room was filled with German friends for several days. They were either waiting to take a bath or to warm up.</p>
<p>The lack of hot water or unheated rooms in Germany is not due to a lack of coal. Germany has a large amount of coal, but two-thirds of its transportation depends on canals, and last winter and this year, all waterways were frozen. Railway transportation is extremely busy and has no time to transport coal, because the German forces on the Western Front must be well supplied, and even those stationed on the "Eastern Frontier," facing the "friendly" Soviet Red Army, cannot be allowed to go hungry.

<h3>Food Prices: Taking Advantage of the Southward Advance Rumor, Imported Rice Sees Another Surge</h3>
<p>If imported rice stocks are high, the market should be stable. However, after domestic traders added purchases and speculators became active the day before yesterday, market sentiment became tense. Although arrivals continued yesterday, buying interest was even stronger, and major players both inside and outside the industry were absorbing stocks. Holders took the opportunity to raise prices, and old rumors about port transport being blocked and ships heading south were revived. Prices for all current rice grades rose across the board in tandem. Afternoon trading resulted in an overall increase of one or two yuan compared to the previous day. Huilong and Huasi small-pattern rice also rose by two yuan. Current small-pattern rice opened at 129, and speculative buying intensified in the afternoon, further tightening market sentiment. Number 1 Saigon rice even reached 115 yuan. Prices for all other rice grades uniformly rose by one or two yuan again. Total daily volume increased to 30,000 bags. At closing, Number 1 Saigon was at 113-114 yuan, Number 2 at 111 yuan, followed by 109 yuan. Number 1 Hualate was at 111-112 yuan, Huowen at 112 yuan, followed by 110 yuan, small-pattern rice at 108.5 yuan, 108 yuan, medium at 107.5 yuan, Tokyo polished long-grain at 102 yuan, followed by 100 yuan, broken long-grain at 88-89 yuan, followed by 84-85 yuan, and Min Party at 108-109 yuan.</p>
<p>Although owners of various grades of domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica, saw imported rice surging, they also considered taking the opportunity to raise prices. However, due to weak buying interest in domestic stores, it was difficult to keep pace with imported rice. As a result, prices remained flat. Changbang high-quality special japonica opened at 120 yuan, special japonica at 117-118 yuan, high at 116 yuan, Kunshan high-quality white japonica at 115 yuan, followed by 109 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice at 109 yuan, 108.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice traditionally follows imported rice. Currently, not only are retail sales brisk, but major players are also absorbing stocks, resulting in a wide distribution. Holders are raising prices aggressively, with selling prices increasing by one or two yuan along with imported rice. Hong Kong special glutinous opened at 106-107 yuan, large market at 104-105 yuan, medium grade at 102 yuan, glutinous green bean special at 99 yuan, followed by 97 yuan, and broken glutinous at 91-92 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market continued to be strong. Due to rising rice prices and heightened tensions in the Pacific, market sentiment was generally firm. Holders were generally inclined to maintain prices. Bird &amp; Flower brand Australian flour and Golden Dragon brand Canadian flour once reached 29 yuan, but as retail sellers released some stocks, prices fluctuated between 28.8-28.9 yuan. Other brands were also stable. Total market sales of Canadian and Australian flour were over 10,000 bags, all sold to retailers. Chinese factory plain flour remained at 25 yuan, with over 5,000 bags distributed by Fuxin Factory, the shortfall supplemented by imported flour.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was as calm as usual. Domestic wheat supply has long been dwindling, and due to a lack of overseas shipping capacity, trading companies cannot accept orders for imported wheat. Wheat market transactions have essentially stopped. Currently, Japanese factories are not absorbing stocks from retail outlets. Old prices remain between 45-46 yuan. Amid rising rice and flour prices, the market has become more stable.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Speculation Rises Again, No Oil Cake or Miscellaneous Grain Untouched by Price Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the oil, bean cake, and miscellaneous grain market, people's minds were swayed by rumors, and the "kick the ball" business flourished again, causing market prices to be chaotic and unclear, creating alarming waves and many twists and turns. As a result, Dalian oil was intentionally cornered by the yarn and flower gangs due to a shortage of spot chips (a portion of over four thousand barrels of newly arrived goods were still being tested due to excessive moisture and could not be delivered). The market price soared by four to five yuan. Transactions included 300 barrels of spot goods, 1,400 barrels of futures, and 200 dan of factory oil. Peanut oil trends were flat and lackluster. Soybeans suddenly rose by two yuan. Tianjin beans, due to ample supply, only increased by six or seven jiao. Transactions included 1,400 to 1,500 bags of various beans. Bean cake futures and spot trading totaled over 26,000 pieces, with prices rising by four to five jiao. Corn rose by two to three yuan. Transactions included over 5,000 bags of spot goods and 400 tons of futures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,000 cans of soybean oil were shipped from Tianjin. Today, 250 bags of soybeans and 500 bags of raw kernels will be shipped to Hong Kong. Additionally, 2,040 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Finance Payment Settlement for Kerosene and Imported Cotton, Foreign Exchange Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates remain stable. The unofficial markets for British and American currencies showed a trend towards tightening, as the rumors from the previous day proved unfounded. The opening price for American currency was soft, and there was substantial real demand from foreign firms, such as payment settlements for kerosene and cotton. Speculators slightly covered their short positions. However, there were offers from outside firms seeking profit, so the situation in the middle remained relatively stable. By the close, British gold was at 3 pence 25, and the American exchange rate was at 5.34375 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day. Futures for British currency were flat, while American currency weakened slightly.</p>
<p>Short Covering Also Occurs</p>
<p>In the morning, the London prime rate and the Bank of America rate, as well as the price of London raw gold, remained unchanged. Exchange rates were flat except for the Shanghai-US dollar rate, which rose by six fen. Central Bank listed rates remained the same. Banks' morning spot selling prices were 3 pence 265625 for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for the American exchange rate, compared to the previous day, British currency was flat and American currency tightened by 0.03125. After the opening, the market situation was calm and unchanged. Chinese banks absorbed May American currency at 5.375 and 5.34375 yuan from firms seeking profit. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balance also remained flat. Afterwards, the foreign firms had settlement needs for items like kerosene and cotton, causing the market to soften. It is estimated that outside firms bought May American currency at 5.34375 yuan in April and May. At that time, immediate sterling was already tightening to 3 pence 25. After this, trading became sparse, and fluctuations were flat. By the close, rates were 3 pence 15 and 5.34375 yuan.</p>
<p>British Merchants Still Providing Supply</p>
<p>The after-market situation was calm. Foreign firms continued to buy, accounting for this month's Central Bank sterling at 3 pence 25. Later, speculators and brokers also settled April and May American currency at 5.34375 yuan, all supplied by Messageries Maritimes. At the same time, a certain bank also absorbed this month's American currency at 5.34375 yuan from its peers. As a result, both spot and futures for British gold closed at 3 pence 25. The spot rate for American currency was 5.34375 yuan, and the futures rate was 5.3125 yuan. Compared to the previous day, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.015625 for spot, while futures were flat. American currency weakened by 0.03125 for both spot and futures.</p>
<p>Hong Kong American Currency Tightens</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 8th (Tuesday) dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. British and Japanese exchange rates continued to fluctuate. American currency tightened by 0.0625 for spot, to 24.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by 5 jiao, to 459 yuan (yesterday's close was 459.5 yuan). At 11:30, rates were flat, with no changes in any exchange rates.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Currency Both Contract</p>
<p>Tianjin, 8th (Tuesday) dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened soft this morning. The London telegraphic transfer tightened by 0.03125, to 3 pence 21875. The New York telegraphic transfer also contracted by 0.03125, to 5.3125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1 yuan, to 100 yuan flat exchange. The unofficial market for "Joint Notes" continued to rise by 2.5 yuan, to 57.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the market price of silver dollars fluctuate upwards. British and American gold pounds also each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged. The market price stabilized. American gold notes rose after an initial drop, having once fallen to 2 jiao 4 fen before immediately increasing. In the evening market, it reached 18.4 yuan, a rise of 1 jiao 1 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a trend towards firmness, with market prices rising. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended firmer, with the former reaching 1.97 yuan and the latter reaching 1.62 yuan.</p>
<h3>Swap Period Ends, Gold Market Covers Shorts and Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar unofficial market saw the market rebound and strengthen as the rumors from the previous day subsided and the exchange market tightened due to foreign firms settling payments. The evening market trended especially firm, exceeding the 6,500 yuan mark. This was because operators, seeing that the swap was based on the American currency settlement price, continued to discount by 50 to 60 yuan, causing general short positions to be covered. Hengji and Kangyong absorbed particularly large amounts, and Da Feng also absorbed frequently. As a result, the market rebounded by 50 yuan. Total transactions amounted to approximately 16,000 to 17,000 taels. Spot transactions were quite active. Xiangxing, Yongxian, and Xianghe accounted for 190 taels, rising by 180 yuan. Chengji accounted for 60 taels, and Yongcheng accounted for 50 taels, both rising by 180 yuan. Yuxing, Yongxing, and Yongcheng each followed with 50 taels, rising by 175 yuan. Later, Tianyuan sold 10 taels to Tiancheng and Shunyuan sold 30 taels, with an increase of only 170 yuan. Later, Litae and Jin Feng sold 40 taels, rising by 180 yuan, approximately 80 yuan higher than the previous day. Ornamental gold and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Rises by 50 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, each bar (ten taels) opened steadily, first reporting an opening price of 6,470 yuan, 15 yuan higher than the previous day. It then rose another 5 yuan. Rencheng Yong bought at 6,475 yuan. However, selling pressure suddenly increased, with Tianyuan adding to its short position and Xinfeng Yong closing its long position. The price briefly fell to 6,460 yuan. Subsequently, Tongkang Yong, Hengji, Chengji, Defu, and others competed to absorb and cover short positions. Da Feng also bought in. Before long, the exchange market continued to tighten, and the price gradually rose to 6,488 yuan. After 10 o'clock, Xin Yuan and Xianghe emerged as long players, and Xinfeng Yong and Shun Yuan also sold off. However, there were still buyers at this time, causing the market to fluctuate between 6,488 yuan and 715 yuan. By the close, the price was 6,485 yuan. The after-market opened again at 6,485 yuan, subsequently falling slightly by 3 yuan. However, Hengji Tongkang Yong resumed covering short positions, and Da Feng continued to buy. However, Chengji, Xianghe, retail investors, and others sold off, causing the price to rise to 6,497 yuan before returning to flat. Ten minutes before the close, due to the renewed entry of Hengji Tongkang Yong Da Feng and others, retail investors rushed in, and the price momentarily rose to 6,510 yuan. Later, Xinfeng Yong Decheng Deda sold off, falling by 7 yuan. However, the closing price was 6,505 yuan, resulting in a rise of 50 yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the April American dollar settlement price of 5.3125 yuan, it was 6,555 yuan 3 jiao, with a difference of 50 yuan 3 jiao. After the close, it rose again to 6,510 yuan, and finally to 6,508 yuan. The high and low points for the entire day also differed by 50 yuan. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 200 yuan higher than the silver dollar futures price. The closing price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot standard gold.</p>
<p>Price of Ornamental Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of silver shop's ornamental gold for each tael was 680 yuan, quoted by Datonghang and Xintonghang, and remained unchanged. The purchase price decreased by 40 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Long Positions Deliberately Spread Misinformation, Double Horse Ships Outward, Market Price Re-enters the 400 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market has shifted from circumlocution to upward movement. This is due to the long positions releasing news that a batch of Shuang Ma (Double Horse) yarn is being shipped overseas for sale. In addition, miscellaneous brands of yarn are steadily advancing, which has especially boosted morale. However, sales through Hong Kong channels are still mediocre, with only 270 bales of various yarns being purchased. Therefore, the short positions remain unmoved, and the market condition still does not show signs of tightening. However, the long positions, observing the daily promotion of Shuang Ma, are trending higher in sentiment. There are quite a few who are taking long positions, so today's market condition is showing a slight trend of activity, unlike the dull and stagnant situation of the past. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,400 yuan, and the low price was 1,393.5 yuan. In the early afternoon, it initially traded at 1,402-3 yuan. Subsequently, morale improved, and the price gradually rose to 1,410 yuan. The final price was 1,409.5 yuan. Today, 37 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Penang, 62 pieces to Singapore, and 475 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Shuang Ma was still unremarkable, due to the ongoing Balkan conflict and the activities of the short positions. The opening price was 1,396 yuan, and selling pressure was strong, with chaotic shouting. The price fell to 1,393.5 yuan. Subsequently, as foreign exchange stabilized and standard gold prices increased, the actual situation within the market halted, and buying became even more prevalent. The long positions also spread rumors that Shuang Ma would be shipped to Germany. For a time, buying was enthusiastic, and the price recovered to 1,398.5 yuan. However, as procurement from Hong Kong channels was weak, the situation softened again. By the time of closing, it was heard that the selling price of miscellaneous brand yarn was very high, and the short positions covered, causing the price to rise to 1,400 yuan at the close. A review of the transaction statistics for the half-day showed 3,740 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 270 Peer 2,400</p>
<p>Amoy 20 Statistics 3,740</p>
<p>Inland 50</p>
<h3>Fine Lint Has Only Rises, No Falls</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains good, but the price of Indian cotton is falling significantly, and American cotton is also continuing to decline. However, people's sentiments have not been severely affected. This is because of concerns that the Balkan conflict will spread, potentially creating problems with future sources. Therefore, although factory demand is not very strong, the industry has a unified expectation for higher prices. The cost of fine yarn raw materials is resulting in a situation of only rises and no falls. Yesterday, a total of 1,339 pieces were transacted, plus 400 bales at a flat price. Attached is the current cotton market price as follows:</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 370 Anjian 200 pieces</p>
<p>Middling 373.75 Peer 200 pieces</p>
<p>Also 378 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Pengjiabao 2.4 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Also 296 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Fine Lint Bales 270 Also 239 pieces</p>
<p>Fire Machine Straw Bales 204 Also 400 pieces</p>
<p>Rangoon Cotton 208.25 Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Also 208.75 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 370 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Another piece of news is the enthusiasm, as the industry is very keen on mutual transactions, and factories also require goods. In recent days, the transactions, excluding Indian cotton and Brazilian cotton, have focused on fine yarn raw materials. Both factories and industry peers are actively competing for purchases. As a result, the cotton market has entered a good state, with both activity and firm prices. Yesterday, the market price of Brazilian cotton reached a high of over 370 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>New York's cotton market initially fell in the morning due to sales by foreign merchants and the impact of the Balkan conflict. However, it later rebounded slightly due to some short positions covering. As a result, the closing price was lower by 6 to 10 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell due to a large number of long positions closing and sellers repeatedly selling. Yesterday's closing price fell by approximately 80 to 90 rupees.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cantonese Sales Increase Dramatically, Selling Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth Yesterday, the market initially remained flat before rising, due to the recent dramatic increase in spot sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong. The future order amounts for various factories have already been half booked, arousing hoarding sentiment within and outside the industry. Selling prices have both trended upwards. As a result, white goods, fine cloth, and twill rose by 2.5 jiao, coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, colored cloth rose by 5 jiao, and Gold Pagoda bleached cloth rose by 5 jiao. The remaining brands remained flat. The total transactions in this street were over 600 pieces of various cloths. The Guangdong-Chaozhou group bought over 400 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, flannelette, etc. The Zhejiang-Fujian group bought over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and colored cloth, etc.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth The morning market was flat, and the afternoon market continued to rise, due to active actual sales and high factory prices. In the afternoon, the Longtou fine cloth's Xinzhan order rose to 50.085 yuan, and the Sijunzi serge jumped to 1.535 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports Today, 950 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong, 95 pieces to Singapore, and 4 pieces to Penang.</p>
<h3>Securities Class C Lottery Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds weakened yesterday due to the continued outflow of cash bonds. Yuxing's maturing goods had not yet been cleared out. Tongkang's appetite for them was growing stronger, and Shunchang's buying had not waned. It was rumored that they were collecting goods on behalf of a certain overseas Chinese, almost daily. On one hand, spot goods were continuously flowing out, and on the other hand, a strong force continued to collect goods. The market price was therefore unstable. Judging by the trend, the selling side still had the upper hand for the time being. However, most people in the market were long positions, so although they tried to raise prices, they ultimately failed to reverse the downward trend. It was estimated that the market would only develop slightly after the two types of lotteries. It has now been determined that the lottery will be held on the 10th of this month. Today's market price will be calculated after removing the lottery rights in the afternoon. Yesterday's trading was still not prosperous. In the morning, Lianyi, Lianhe, Shunchang, Hefeng, Yizhong, and Xinhua bought in, while Yuxing sold out a lot of Class A and E bonds. Renfeng, Hongda, and Yitai also continued to sell out. The noon close was slightly weaker. In the afternoon, Tongkang bought in approximately 300,000 yuan, and Shunchang, Zhongyi, and Datong also bought in. However, Yuxing and Renfeng continued to sell out. Xie Kang sold out approximately 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of Class C bonds, and Jiufeng also sold out. The market price was raised several times, but it was ultimately suppressed. The long positions were unable to gain the upper hand for the time being. As a result, prices continued to decrease by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 jiao. Transactions amounted to approximately 1,670,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 73.30 73.00 73.10 Down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified B 68.95 68.10 68.40 Down 0.24</p>
<p>Unified C 67.00 66.60 66.75 Down 0.20</p>
<p>Unified D 64.00 64.90 64.90 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified E 64.60 64.10 64.35 Down 0.30</p>
<p>Regarding stock trading, 100 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of 16 yuan.</p>

Jardine Matheson opened at 21.75 yuan, up 7.5 jiao. Jardine Spinning Mill opened at 43.5 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. The market condition shifted from activity to stagnation, and prices fell back slightly. In the afternoon, it stabilized again, and the closing price was roughly similar to the morning opening.</p>
<p>For rubber stocks, excluding English Chartereds and Langkat, which rose slightly, there were very few transactions for the rest.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Coarse White Recovers</h3>

Dutch red was 67.8 yuan to 68 yuan. Tai Gu granulated white B mark in Western warehouses was 88 yuan. HX mark in Eastern warehouses was 82 yuan. There was little difference. National sugar stocks were already scarce, and new arrivals were also lacking. Quotations have been silent for a long time, equivalent to zero.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items Match Hoarders Resume Purchases</h3>
<p>The price of matches falls and then rises, driven by people's fears of the Balkan conflict expanding, potentially disrupting raw material sources. Hoarders have resumed purchases, and those holding goods are being picky. Purchase prices are moving upwards again. Yesterday, the price of the "Beautiful" brand was 790 yuan, and the price of the "Phoenix" brand was 710 yuan per case, a rebound of 20 yuan compared to yesterday. The market price of the "Ship" brand candles opened at 28.3 yuan. The soap market is currently trending towards stability.

Both have risen by over 100 yuan, which can be said to be unprecedentedly high.</p>

<h3>Based on the Land Regulations, Municipal Councilors Should Be Elected According to Law, Chinese Strictly Observe Silence, Awaiting Development, Portuguese, Swiss, and Russian Nationals Eagerly Compete in the Election</h3>
<p>The election of the Municipal Councilors, on which the public has focused its attention, has entered a critical stage. According to news from relevant parties yesterday, the negotiations among the consuls-general of the three countries will soon conclude. The British and American sides, regarding the change in the number of Municipal Councilors, are rumored not to abandon their consistent policy of "appeasement," even though it has been approved by the Chinese government. The legitimate status of the concession is showing signs of wavering. Although relevant officials from various countries were tight-lipped yesterday and refused to issue any comments, the public believes that the various countries will still violate the law and support candidates who have been put forward based on the "New Ratio" to be the next Municipal Councilors. However, the Chinese community in the city remains strictly silent, awaiting the future development of the situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Legal View Should Be Noted</p>
<p>According to Article 10 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, the number of Western Councilors on the Municipal Council cannot exceed nine or be less than five. In other words, the legal number of Western Councilors is five to nine. Currently, there are nine Western Councilors: five British, two American, and two Japanese, which is indisputable. However, the "New Ratio" increases the number of Western Councilors from nine to twelve, which is clearly illegal, this being the first point. As for the Chinese Councilors, according to the same article, five members are nominated by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, but now it has been reduced to four, which is also illegal, this being the second point. Furthermore, according to Article 18, if the Land Regulations need to be amended, changed, or added to, the final decision rests with the diplomatic representatives of various countries and the highest authorities of China. However, the negotiations among the consuls-general of the three countries have "resolved" to change the number of Councilors first, without submitting the proposal to the Chinese authorities for approval afterwards, which is legally inappropriate. Also, according to international law, any country must be recognized by various countries or a majority of countries before it can have a legal status in the international community. Now that various countries recognize Chongqing as the legitimate government of China, if the British and American authorities take contrary measures, it will not have legal effect.</p>
<p>There are Still Three Chinese Councilors in Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Chinese Councilors on the Municipal Council, because it concerns the interests of millions of Chinese in the concession, the nature is extremely serious. Currently, several Chinese Councilors have already left Shanghai, and the vacancies left behind, according to the explicit provisions of Article 20 of the Land Regulations, the Municipal Councilors can pass a resolution by majority to nominate candidates (such as when American Councilor Kana resigned and returned to his country, and the Board of Directors nominated Ming Side to succeed him). The existing Chinese Ratepayers' Association will never illegally nominate candidates. Therefore, if the Board of Directors does not appoint appropriate personnel to fill the vacancies of several Chinese Councilors, no party may nominate candidates without authorization, otherwise it would be illegal. Although the position of the Chinese Councilors is extremely difficult, for the sake of the happiness of millions of compatriots, they should strive to maintain their legal status. Yesterday, reporters learned from responsible parties that only Yu Qiaqing and Chen Tingrui have left Shanghai among the Chinese Councilors on the Municipal Council. The rumor that Guo Shun has left Shanghai is absolutely incorrect. The other two Councilors are Xi Yushu and Yuan Ludeng. Therefore, there are still three Chinese Councilors in Shanghai, which is one less than the so-called "New Ratio." However, all parties have high expectations for Guo, Xi, and Yuan.</p>
<p>German Candidate is Ge Letai</p>
<p>German merchant Yali Yanghang at 410 Sichuan Road sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating that they had read in your newspaper about the candidates for the British, American, German, and Japanese Councilors. The letter stated that the German Councilor position would be held by German national Gao Laide from this port. They requested that the aforementioned name be corrected to "Ge Letai," etc. After checking, the original name of Mr. Ge is Alfred Glathe, which is hereby published.</p>
<p>Portuguese and Swiss Nationals Prepare Candidates</p>
<p>The Portuguese community has high hopes of obtaining one of the neutral Councilors seats. However, the Portuguese community has not yet decided who to recommend to serve as the Portuguese Councilor. The Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, Melo, has contacted the Consuls-General of other countries and hopes to announce the name of the Portuguese Councilor candidate in the near future. The Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai, Fontana, replied to reporters, saying that there are very few Swiss nationals here who are likely to be nominated as candidates for the Municipal Councilors. The Swiss community will meet in the next few days to decide who to nominate.</p>
<p>White Russians Attempt to Obtain a Seat</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's plan to change the number of Councilors and add two neutral Councilors has aroused considerable excitement among the White Russians in the city. It is heard that the White Russians have drafted a plan to recommend one Russian Councilor, but they have not yet announced who they will nominate. Russian newspapers have all published articles about the British election of the Municipal Councilors, saying that there are 25,000 Russian nationals in Shanghai, who have more right to obtain a Councilor seat than other neutral nationals with fewer people. It is true that most of the White Russians live in the French Concession, but there are still thousands who reside or do business in the International Settlement. Russian newspapers claim that the White Russians also made a contribution to the establishment of the International Settlement. The White Russian team of the Municipal Council Police Force has served the Municipal Council and the International Settlement for the past fourteen years, with excellent results, it is said. It is heard that the White Russian Immigration Committee once met regarding the Municipal Council election, but no resolution was reached. However, according to well-informed sources, the Portuguese and Swiss nationals have the best chance of each occupying a neutral Councilor seat, while the White Russian's chance is extremely slim. It is heard that the White Russian Immigration Committee will hold a general meeting this Saturday to discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>Confirmed that China Communications Bank Detained Employees Have Regained Freedom, Five Senior Executives Left the Night Before</h3>
<p>Regarding the restoration of freedom for the detained employees of the China Communications Banks, the details of the situation were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to news from the English-language Da Mei Evening Post, 150 employees of the China Communications Banks were suddenly arrested on the nights of the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of last month. After repeated mediation by the banking community in the city, all have been allowed to leave. According to inquiries yesterday (the 8th), five senior executives of the Bank of China have regained their freedom. It is also heard that the special committee organized by the China Communications Banks is now conducting negotiations to release all employees. Once the detailed terms have been agreed upon, all employees will be able to leave soon. Responsible people do not believe the rumors that the bail is based on cash. It is said that a total of 128 employees of the Bank of China were detained, including 9 section chiefs, 1 clerk and 1 auditor, and the rest were junior employees. The number of employees of the Bank of Communications who were detained is unknown. Last night, according to news from the Da Zhong News Agency, it was confirmed yesterday that the detained employees of the various banks had been released.</p>
<h3>Coal Merchants Who Raise Prices Try to Cover Up Their Crimes</h3>
<p>According to reports from honest coal merchants, the price increase in the coal industry is a planned action. They are willing to release rumors of urging the retrieval of warehouse receipts, and factories are using transport costs as an excuse to cover up the crime of raising prices. After researching, since the plot of those rascals was revealed in the newspaper regarding a certain large coal briquette factory ordering 30,000 tons of cheap coal cinders from Mitsubishi Foreign Firm, the excuses of transport costs rising and other excuses are self-defeating. Even according to the statement of a certain employee of the Coal Industry Association, the industry has not ordered goods from abroad since transport costs rose. Based on the above facts from various aspects, the authorities should urgently impose sanctions and not ignore it.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest in Various Industries; Labor and Management Nearing Agreement</h3>
<p>Due to their unsuccessful demands for increased living allowances from the four shipping and automobile companies in Ningbo, all drivers and porters went on strike on the 6th of this month. It is now learned that labor and management conducted further negotiations yesterday. Their views are gradually converging, so the labor unrest is expected to be completely resolved in the short term.</p>
<p>Garment Industry Labor and Management Show Mutual Concessions</p>
<p>Following a strike by garment workers in this city for higher wages, a dispute arose over the issue of tailors paying for their meals at shop owners' homes, leading to an escalation of the labor unrest. According to a report from the Datong News Agency yesterday morning, the shop owners have agreed to concede one dime on the meal allowance, meaning each person would pay the shop owner nine dimes per day. The tailors are only willing to concede an additional five cents, making it eight dimes. As a result of the impasse, the garment shops remained closed yesterday, awaiting sincere consultations between the two parties.</p>
<p>Commercial Employees Strive for Pay Raises</p>
<p>The Commercial Press Employees' Association on Henan Road, feeling increasingly impoverished due to runaway inflation, convened a standing committee meeting on the 19th of last month. They resolved to send a letter to General Manager Wang in Hong Kong, requesting immediate and reasonable remedies for the employees' livelihoods. They sent a second letter on March 24, providing a detailed report on the general price increases in Shanghai and the living conditions of the workers. The association then commissioned Section Chief Shi of the Personnel Department to go to Hong Kong to personally plead with General Manager Wang, hoping the proposed measures would be implemented starting in April. Yesterday, they sent another urgent telegram urging a response, but the head office still provided no concrete reply. The association is now strongly advising its members to remain calm and await a reasonable resolution. Yesterday, they also published a notice to the employees.</p>
<h3>Major Ma Ruishan Leaves Shanghai; Various Circles Bid Farewell</h3>
<p>Major Ma Ruishan, the Shanghai District Commander of the Salvation Army, having been ordered to transfer to the Canadian Service Line, departed Shanghai at 10:30 pm last night aboard the American President Lines' President Cleveland. Accompanying him were his family, young children, and several others. Many people from various circles came to the dock to bid him farewell. All handover procedures for the Shanghai District Headquarters have been completed. After his successor, Major Walker, arrives in Shanghai from Tianjin, he will immediately assume the position.</p>
<h3>Foreigners to Rest for Three Days for Easter</h3>
<p>Friday, the 11th of this month, is Easter, according to Western customs. All foreign companies and businesses in this city will be closed for celebration. Churches will also hold special Easter services. The British Consulate General in Shanghai and others will be closed on this day and on Monday, the 14th, in commemoration. Public notice was given yesterday. The Foreign Banks Association has decided to close for three days, starting from the 11th, and will resume business on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Flat and Weak Cigarette Coupon Market Difficult to Revitalize; Speculation Suffers Setbacks</h3>
<p>The cigarette coupon market is very flat and weak. The sales of various daily necessities, such as soap, matches, candles, kerosene, and tobacco, are no longer as brisk as before. At the same time, as the sales of spot goods in the market have declined, the amount of capital in the market has increased, creating a situation of oversupply. Trading by industry peers has been relatively stable for the past two days. Speculators are at their wits' end. Their price-fixing rumors are no longer believed. Although they still attempt to reverse the decline, they are unable to rally public sentiment and feel uneasy and panicked. According to a person familiar with the cigarette coupon industry yesterday, after the prices of the above-mentioned daily necessities were driven up by speculators, people felt uneasy and rushed to buy spot goods in the market in an attempt to hoard them and wait for high prices before selling. At that time, there were few sellers of spot goods in the market. However, various manufacturers increased production in order to meet market demand. Therefore, spot goods in the market have gradually increased recently. At the same time, the general public is also buying in small quantities due to high prices, so actual consumption has become weak. Therefore, cigarette coupon shops have no intention of continuing to buy in the market. Many external speculators holding large quantities of spot goods feel extremely uneasy because all of their hoarded goods were purchased at high prices. Now that market prices are loosening, they will inevitably have to sell them at a low price. Moreover, their capital is limited and they cannot hoard them for long, so they are suffering losses. If they do not wake up, it is expected that they will suffer even more severe setbacks.</p>
<h3>Foreign Pigments Allowed to be Transported from Shanghai to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>According to transportation industry sources, pigments from all countries are allowed to be imported from Shanghai into Zhejiang Province. The Ningbo Zhejiang Customs Tax Bureau has also issued a public notice stating that "Pigments and chemical raw materials, regardless of their country of origin, shall be released."</p>
<h3>Postal Package Service Resumed in Soviet Areas</h3>
<p>The bulk package and bulk small package postal services of the Suqian Bureau in Jiangsu Province and the personal scattered package service of the Qintong Bureau in Taixian County have now resumed acceptance of mail.</p>
<h3>Touring Free China – The Life of Hemingway – An Introduction to Contemporary American War Literature</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>"For Whom the Bell Tolls," published last year, is his representative work. The content takes a four-day short love affair of a young couple as the weft and the Spanish fascist nationalist army and the Republican army civil war as the warp. The structure is similar to "A Farewell to Arms," except that the former takes the tail end of the pre-European war as the background. At that time, the author believed that war was nothing but meaningless slaughter, so the book describes the protagonists meeting by chance and eagerly seeking moments of pleasure. In the latter book, the author has admitted that war is not only not crazy, but also has great significance and importance, and people should disregard personal feelings for the sake of honor. He used to be disgusted with the hypocrisy of "heroism" and "patriotism" of the world, but now he no longer holds such views.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "For Whom the Bell Tolls," which sings loudly of "returning to the battlefield," expresses the innermost feelings of the people and is by no means comparable to vulgar love novels. On the other hand, this is a political novel. The author believes that the Spanish Civil War was the prelude to the current European War, implying that the defeat of any nation in the world will affect other nations. Bureaucratic politics, corrupt elements, and heresies, once victorious, will be the end of justice and fairness. Therefore, mankind must fight for their beliefs. This is glory, this is the tragedy of mankind, and it is also the crystallization of great art.</p>
<p>The sharpness of the writing and the depth of emotion in this book are comparable to those of the great British writer Kipling, and the current sales have reached 700,000 copies. Because its impression on readers is too profound, although the material is taken from a corner of Spain, what it describes is the touching truth of all mankind.</p>
<p>In short, Hemingway wrote this masterpiece, recognizing him as a genius war writer. He needs a just war to endow his art with supreme dignity.</p>
<p>Hemingway is a burly man, good at hunting and fishing. He is also a first-class reporter. Although he is unwilling to talk about grand theories, he will talk and laugh eloquently when he is in the mood. He has worked in Paris, Madrid, and dozens of cities in the United States. He has been married twice, has one son, and inspected the front lines of Guangdong and Guangxi with his wife last month. He has now arrived in Chongqing. (He flew from Guilin to Chongqing on the 6th of this month.)</p>
<p>A list of Hemingway's works: "Three Stories and Ten Poems" (1923), "In Our Time" (1924), "The Torrents of Spring" and "The Sun Also Rises" (1926), "Men Without Women" (1927), "A Farewell to Arms" (1929</p>
<h3>Arresting Kidnapping Bandits and Punishing Them Separately</h3>
<p>The Central Police Department's Chinese Detective Chief, along with detectives Peng Bingsheng, Wang Shusheng, Zhang Guanying, and others, previously apprehended a large group of notorious bandits, including Ma Lizeng, totaling fourteen individuals. They confiscated three handguns, over ninety bullets, and two hand grenades. Investigations revealed their involvement in intended kidnappings, such as that of Ke Weiru, and robberies, including the theft of dance tickets from Chen Liju at 245 North Fujian Road. The cases were handed over to the Special First Court, where trials have concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng announced the verdicts: Ma Lizeng was sentenced to seven years and six months; Wu Zhenhua, Pan Jixiang, and Zhang Yiping were each sentenced to six years; Wang Ruishi was sentenced to nine years and six months; Yang Gensheng was sentenced to five years and two months; Zhang Liansheng was sentenced to five years; Zhuang Xingzhi was sentenced to six months; Zhou Caimin and Chen Jifa were each sentenced to four months; Wang Laoting was sentenced to three months; Zhang Mingsheng, Zheng Minghe, and Ke Hanbo were acquitted. The handguns, bullets, and hand grenades were all confiscated. The Police Department's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that they would waive the right to appeal.</p>
<h3>Cheng Xinchang Robbed; County Offers Reward for Capturing Robbers</h3>
<p>On the 4th of this month, at approximately 2:00 PM, more than ten robbers suddenly entered the warehouse of Cheng Xinchang Silk Company, located on the fourth floor at 125 Sichuan Road. Two robbers brandished guns and used hemp rope to tie up the watchman. They then moved seven cases of Shandong Huangchang silk, valued at over 35,000 yuan, out and loaded them onto a vehicle parked in front of Yuting Gate, disappearing without a trace. A reward of 5,000 yuan has now been offered for the arrest of the robbers involved in the case.</p>
<h3>Lei Binglin Invents Coarse Spinning Guide Yarn Machine</h3>
<p>It is reported that after various yarn factories received orders from the concession authorities to save electricity in order to reduce consumption, most have considered issues such as reducing labor and saving money. Therefore, the output of each factory will inevitably be affected. Now, Mr. Lei Binglin, chief engineer of the First Factory of Wing On Textile Company, after years of research, has successively invented the "Fine Spinning Large Draft Machine Parts", "Coarse Spinning Guide Yarn Double-Hole Horn", and "U-Shaped Machine Parts". The former has been approved for patents by the former Ministry of Industry and the governments of Britain, the United States, France, India, and other countries. The coarse spinning guide yarn U-shaped machine parts have also been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and granted patents. The installation of this type of guide yarn machine parts can reduce the number of coarse spinning frames by half while still achieving the same output, and the costs of labor, electricity, materials, and repairs can also be reduced by half. This machine part has been adopted by the Xinsheng Yarn Factory at 748 Tokyo Road, Shanghai, and compared to the original 14,000 spindles, more than 10,000 spindles have been added. The increase in effectiveness is almost 80 percent, and the supply of coarse yarn is not only not lacking, but also more than sufficient. Those who want to know the details can visit or study at the factory to know that the statement is not false. Under the current extraordinary circumstances, if each yarn factory wants to maintain its original output and achieve twice the result with half the effort, adopting Lei's coarse spinning guide yarn machine parts will really help, and the cost of modifying the machine is very cheap, and the results can be seen immediately. The contact address is 843 Weihaiwei Road.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

The ancient style of "Old Plum Blossom Picture" is also Wang's masterpiece. As for the various peaks of Huangshan, they are ethereal, peculiar, and densely arranged without end, all played by Wang with simple ink.

As a result of the draw, Lu Hanjun happened to meet Guo Ren, a strong player from Huawei. Lu relied on his rich experience to eliminate Guo Ren in three straight sets. Lu continued his efforts, defeating Shao Ruqian and Zhong Xianfang in a row, and won the final. When the second final elimination round began, Guo Ren and Zhong Xianfang faced each other. Little Zhong calmly fought and defeated Guo Ren with a score of 3-0, which was very rare. After this, Zhong overcame Shao Ruqian with a score of 3-1 and faced Lu Hanjun to compete for the championship. As soon as Lu took the stage, he launched a bombardment-style attack, and Zhong was caught off guard and lost a lot of points.

<p>Study Lecture</p>
<h3>How to Prepare Daily Homework (Part One)</h3>
<p>— Lu Shaoji</p>
<p>3.  Methods for Preparing Homework</p>
<p>Young students who want to achieve good results in preparing their daily homework should pay attention to the following points in addition to having the above-mentioned conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Time and Place Allocation Should Be Appropriate: Every young person should arrange a detailed timetable of daily work according to his own ability, such as when to go to the classroom for class, when to prepare homework in the room, when to have meals, when to get up, when to go to bed, and list them in the table one by one. Also, how much time is needed for previewing a certain subject, or when to switch to the next class, should also be roughly specified. In this way, it can avoid the difficulties of "not knowing where to start." It is equally important for young people to have a fixed place and a fixed time to prepare their homework. When doing homework, there must be a specific table and a specific chair, often used for reading and mental work. That place is the place to study. When the scheduled time arrives, go to that place and sit down, so that you can naturally feel at ease to do things.</p>
<p>(2) Prepare Immediately After Class: Prepare the homework instructed for a certain subject immediately after that subject's class. The reasons are: A. After a certain subject's class, there is still a tendency to learn that subject, so it is advisable to take advantage of the situation. B. Preview questions are still in your ears. C. After studying the subject twice, it is easier to remember.</p>
<p>(3) Pay Attention Immediately When Starting: When starting to prepare homework, first take a complete look at the assigned teaching materials, and also understand the work to be done, and insist on doing the thing in front of you as quickly as possible. In other words, when starting work, start immediately and work until it is finished.</p>
<p>(4) Be Focused When Preparing: When starting to prepare, you should use all your strength. Later, you must also concentrate your attention, have courage, have self-confidence, and not be tempted by your inner self or by the outside world. You must steadily proceed towards the goal and work diligently. At a minimum, you must be able to prepare one subject. If the goal is difficult to achieve at once, you must also complete it in stages. But one point to note is that after intense work, you must take a moment to rest, so that your mind is free, and then continue to do other work.</p>
<p>(5) Have the Intention to Remember When Preparing: Having the intention to remember is also an important condition when preparing homework. If you only read mechanically without the determination to remember, the effect will not be great. Therefore, when reading your own books, if you see something important, you may want to underline it with a pen to make it conspicuous. Also, when you encounter complex reading materials, you can make a large outline to facilitate memorization.</p>
<p>(6) Have Interest When Preparing: "Interest", "attention" and "memory" are all elements of effective learning. Therefore, when preparing homework, you must find motivation and make yourself interested in the homework. If you encounter a subject you don't like, you must supplement it with motivation or inducements. The teacher in charge of the subject should be responsible for arousing interest.</p>
<p>(7) Connect New and Old Lessons: When preparing new lessons, you should make a general review of the old lessons. The reasons are: A. The old spies are more familiar and not difficult to pay attention to, and it is easy to use them as a starting point for previewing new lessons. B. This kind of review can deepen the impression of the review material once, making it easier to remember later. C. This review material can show many points of contact with the new lesson. In other words, its function is to connect the new and old, and to provide a fundamental condition for learning.</p>
<p>(8) Avoid Reliance and Perfunctoriness: When preparing homework, you should get rid of the idea of working for the teacher. For more difficult subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics, you should spend more time and pay special attention. Do not seek help from others unless absolutely necessary. When answering questions, do not be discouraged if you encounter the first setback. You should have the determination to try again and again. Also, when preparing homework, you must recognize what you are doing, and do not be perfunctory. You must understand the teacher's intention in assigning the preview and the importance of the subject.</p>
<p>In short, the method for young students to prepare their daily homework is to actively arrange a weekly homework schedule, prepare immediately after class, and pay attention immediately when starting. Also, when preparing, you must be focused, have the intention to remember, have interest, and seek to connect with old lessons. As for the negative aspects, you must avoid perfunctoriness and avoid reliance. Daily homework should be prepared in this way. The same can be done when preparing for exams. And if daily homework can be prepared very well, then preparing for exams will be very easy.</p>

<h3>"Different Tunes, Same Skill"</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>The wonder of "different tunes, same skill" lies precisely in "same skill" and yet "different tunes."</p>
<p>This is a very good way to hide things: perhaps relying on one's own authority and power; perhaps relying on the magic of one's own money; perhaps relying on one's own "unimaginable" potential... And so, doing whatever one wants, saying whatever one wants, everything is possible!</p>
<p>But after all, "Heaven bestows a great responsibility on this person," one cannot "use outright force" nor can one "repeat the same old tricks"; thinking this way and that, calculating this way and that, and so the "different tunes" are created, and the "skill," of course, is "six of one, half a dozen of the other," not much different.</p>
<p>And people suddenly look at it, not only thinking it is "disobedient," but even want to "applaud and praise": "What a kind gentleman!" (It's best to "sing" it.)</p>
<p>For this reason, the clever ones are competing to play "different tunes"; only fools specialize in playing "old tunes."</p>
<p>The more "different tunes" are played, perhaps it will respond to the principle of "when things reach an extreme, they revert"; people become suspicious...</p>
<p>Therefore, the unfortunateness of different tunes but the same skill also lies precisely in "different tunes" and yet "same skill"!</p>
<h3>Third Aunt Buys Coal Briquettes</h3>
<p>— Contemplation</p>
<p>A night of wind and rain chased "spring" without a trace, and, the next morning, it was still drizzling incessantly.</p>
<p>Third Aunt, with a wrapped vegetable basket under her arm and an umbrella in her hand, adjusting herself carefully, walked home from the vegetable market with her bound feet.</p>
<p>On the trucks, large bamboo baskets were piled high with coal dust, one basket after another, about thirty baskets, stacked high. The trucks passed her by. The large oilcloth covering the coal baskets, caught by the wind, fluttered like a flapper's braids, making "pa pa pa" sounds.</p>
<p>This caught Third Aunt's attention and stirred up her household affairs worries. She thought, "The price of coal briquettes is probably going to rise again, right? I should probably order a load in advance to be safe."</p>
<p>She muttered to herself, and trudged to the front of the coal store. She peered inside stealthily. "Heh!" she thought to herself, "How much money are all these goods worth!" Inside the coal store, coal briquettes, lumps of coal, and firewood were piled up, leaving only a narrow path to walk through. Third Aunt only knew they were valuable, but couldn't estimate how much they were worth.</p>
<p>She hesitantly asked the coal-black-faced shop assistant:</p>
<p>"What's the price of coal briquettes?"</p>
<p>"Thirteen yuan."</p>
<p>"Thirteen yuan?" Third Aunt's heart skipped a beat. "Wasn't it only twelve yuan the day before yesterday?"</p>
<p>"It went up today."</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh..." Third Aunt calmed down, thinking to herself, "There's still enough for a few more days at home, I'll wait and see, maybe it will drop. Sigh, these days..."</p>
<p>Thus, one day passed in vain.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, Third Aunt passed by the coal store with her vegetable basket, worriedly going forward to test her "fate."</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>"Sixteen yuan!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Third Aunt was stunned. "How did it go up so much!"</p>
<p>The shop assistant glared at Third Aunt disdainfully, saying:</p>
<p>"Up, heh! Soon there won't be any to burn, if foreign countries start a war, the supply route will be cut off immediately."</p>
<p>"Then, then it hasn't been cut off yet!" Third Aunt anxiously argued with the shop assistant.</p>
<p>"You woman are really," the shop assistant's eyebrows suddenly tightened as if someone had punched him, "Don't you know the coal briquette factory is on strike? If the workers do all the work, what's left for the boss to earn!"</p>
<p>"Then, then what did they earn before?..."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(6) Product of Love</p>
<p>"How could there be none! When my mother died the year before last, I personally sent her coffin back to my hometown, which is in Dongxiang, Cangzhou. Open your eyes and look around, it's almost all green." Mentioning his hometown, Begonia's spirits immediately increased a lot.</p>
<p>"The vegetables grown in the fields, freshly picked and cooked, are much tastier than big fish and meat!"</p>
<p>Xiangqi immediately stood up from the bed, obviously also very excited.</p>
<p>"Although Cangzhou is a bit closer, since it's the countryside, it's unlikely that they'll be able to find it. But did Yuan Shaowen go there with you the year before last?"</p>
<p>"No, because I have no home there at all."</p>
<p>"Then who else is there?"</p>
<p>"There's a paternal uncle and several cousins, all farmers, very honest." Begonia constantly stroked his hands, feeling that these hands were indeed kept very tender, and their fineness was no less than that of ordinary women. But when it came to practicality, how could they compare to the rough hands of his uncle, cousins, and cousins, which were worse than bamboo? "Living with them wouldn't be as interesting as it is now, but countrymen are inevitably more timid. If they knew about our affairs, they would definitely not dare to take us in."</p>
<p>Xiangqi took a few more steps forward, the corner of her clothes already touching the square table on Begonia's right.</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant at all," she bent her four fingers and tapped the table lightly three or five times. "A person wants to come up with an idea to teach others to take him in, that's not very interesting at all! Who can rely on who in this world? So we might as well not do this thing, but if we do it, we have to rely on ourselves..."</p>
<p>Begonia's lips barely moved, wanting to interject, but Xiangqi had already continued vigorously.</p>
<p>"You can first send some of the money you've saved back, and ask your uncle to buy a few acres of farmland nearby, and build a few small houses. Just say that every summer, you plan to go to the countryside to rest for a month or two, so they won't suspect anything else. At the same time, you can also take this opportunity to give your uncle some more money to make him happy, and it's always good to have more care in the same village in the future."</p>

<h3>Not Taking a Penny</h3>
<p>— Shu Ying</p>
<p>Depending on leadership for food, depending on strength for food, depending on brains for food... it seems there is nothing more labor-saving, more profitable, and that comes with more "refreshing decisiveness" than "taking advantage of a fire to rob."</p>
<p>Understanding this point, then one wants to skim before, one wants to skim after, and one wants to skim from above and below. And the oath that always hangs on the corner of the mouth, "If there is any corruption, may Heaven punish and the Earth destroy," can definitely be used first, can definitely be used second, can definitely be used third; and it can be used forever.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "Not to give a penny to others, not to take a penny from others." Of course, regardless of whether old Master Mencius is "in line with the trend" now, I think these two sentences can be examined with a magnifying glass!</p>
<p>If, in the unlikely event that the examination reveals disagreement, then there is no need for the curse of "Heaven punish and the Earth destroy"! I would truly have to face the consequences, wouldn't that be terrible?</p>
<p>I say: As long as you have a "conscience," that's enough...</p>
<h3>Pen Flowers</h3>
<p>— You Zuoxun</p>
<p>Willing to do "bitter" work, then there is no "bitter" situation; able to learn "good" examples, then one is a "good" person.</p>
<p>Evil friends should not be associated with, because the difficulty of "breaking off relations" with them is like a new brush stained with ink, which cannot be washed clean by any means.</p>
<p>Knowing one's mistakes and correcting them is indeed a virtue, but it is still like a nail on the wall, even if it is removed, its trace will remain forever.</p>
<p>The future is indeed vast and dark, but do not be afraid, for those who are fearless, there is always a bright and smooth road ahead. I got a lot!"</p>
<p>The workers ignored Granny Sanhao and left, shouting "Khan, Khan."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Granny Sanhao complained to herself, "Why did I ask him all these irrelevant things? How could my father figure out this kind of thing? My heavens, should I buy a load or not?"</p>
<p>Granny Sanhao thought of her child, thirty years old, uh, thirty years old, but looking as old as thirty-six or thirty-seven, especially in the last three years, alas, always coughing. Granny Sanhao advised him to buy some cheap tonics to eat, but, alas, but a hundred or so old dollars had to support a mother, support a wife, and support a baby just over one year old. It was already lucky not to be in debt, where would there be money...</p>
<p>"Why think about these things again?" Her nose was sour and watery, and Granny Sanhao almost shed old tears, "Should I buy a load or not? ...Ah, ...buy a load, alas! I'll use the money Ashun gave me to buy a water chestnut pillow first, I won't see it anyway when I'm dead!"</p>
<p>Granny Sanhao trembled and pleaded with the clerk: "Boss, send a load, make sure the weight is enough!"</p>
<p>"Sixteen dollars!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know, six-teen—dol-lars! Alas, make sure the weight is enough!"</p>
<p>Granny Sanhao, with tears in her eyes, struggled to twist her small feet and walked towards her home, praying in her heart: "I can only ask the ancestors to bless me, so that Ashun can get a raise soon..."</p>
<p>A truck sped past her, coal dust, piled high in baskets, drilling into Granny Sanhao's eyes.</p>
<h3>Without a Title</h3>
<p>— Juan Juan</p>
<p>A son getting married is just a father becoming an old grandpa, what's so strange about that? I am "just turning thirty," and it has nothing to do with twenty-nine or twenty-one, but I want to place an advertisement to announce it to relatives and friends. There is no other reason, everyone "knows what's going on."</p>
<p>Therefore, "old and sick, recuperating in another place," or "shutting the door to decline visitors, not asking about worldly affairs," all have profound meanings.</p>
<p>But things are valued for their rarity, and fabrics from 1941 are the most popular. Everyone copying old articles will inevitably lack interest and lose its "purpose," or even be "slapping oneself in the face"—for example, the account of "eating white rice" is "slapping oneself left and right" in the advertisement.</p>
<p>After the "white" ones suffered losses, the "black" ones naturally became smarter: first, they respectfully inform the holders of warehouse receipts to take delivery of goods immediately, as if "serving society and sparing no effort," and if there is any disturbance, only those holding warehouse receipts will be questioned! But this is the prelude; when the embroidered curtain is drawn open, the formal program begins, and this program is called "temporary increase in price"!</p>
<p>In addition to "sincerely expressing our sincerity," a new record of sixteen yuan per unit was created!</p>

<h3>Talking About Several Monkeys in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>In the North, those who are famous for performing monkey operas, after Zhang Honglin, were Yang Xiaolou, and among the Kunqu opera troupes, Hao Zhenji. Among the younger generation, Ye Shengzhang, Li Wanchun, Li Shaochun, Li Shengbin, Li Shengzuo, Liu Fengkui, Liang Huichao, and Zhang Yunxi, all excel in monkey operas, but their art and skill are not as good as Yang Xiaolou and Hao Zhenji. Xiaolou's monkey opera rarely has the air of a monkey, and Lao Hao's Monkey King is too much like an ape. Yang Ling said, "Although Wukong is also a monkey, he must break free from the form. It's okay to occasionally have the appearance of a monkey, but always acting like an ape will turn him into a little ape, not like Sun Wukong." Therefore, Yang Xiaolou's monkey opera doesn't have the ape-like tone, but his fame is very big because his face, figure, and limbs are already monkey-like enough. Hao Zhenji, apart from his facial movements, hand movements, and foot placements being exactly like a monkey, has no other special talents. Experts consider him inferior to Xiaolou.</p>
<p>Southern monkey operas have never been highly valued. Although Saihuohou (Zheng Changtai) was good at performing monkey operas, he was not very famous. His son, Xiaohuohou (Zheng Faxiang), is also a master in the field. This person is extremely moral. In his early years, he was highly valued by Huang Jinrong, who specially built a theater, named Qitian Stage (now the Gong Stage), and invited him to star in "Journey to the West," which caused a sensation at the time. In the last ten years, he has been quite frustrated. He once performed in a small theater, but he cherishes monkey opera very much. Before joining a stage, he insisted on not performing monkey operas as a prerequisite, and the order of the plays could be changed freely (except for "Sizhou City"). Recently, he was affiliated with the Da Xin Company's Beijing troupe and starred in "Journey to the West." It is a pity that a hero has not been recognized. He has an apprentice named Xiaoxiaohuohou, who is the grandson of Niu Songshan and the son of Niu Xiaoshan. Yang Xiaolou and Li Wanchun's "Night Flight" was passed down by the Niu family. The Niu family's martial arts roles are very famous, so Xiaoxiaohuohou's "Eight Great Hammers" is very outstanding. Martial clown operas and Guan operas are all family traditions. His monkey opera was corrected by Zheng Faxiang. In recent years, he has traveled to Gan and Yu and has a little reputation. He entered the Xianshi Amusement Park in the new year, and soon went to Tianjin. Recently, he returned from Tianjin to accept the assignment of the New World authorities and served as the pillar of the Da Jing troupe.</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian once starred in "Journey to the West" at the Gong Stage. His monkey opera is different from others, focusing on real skills, such as playing the pipa on a camel's back, playing the pipa with one hand and wielding a whip with the other, and one foot can still dance with a ring. Wang Guiqing learned from him. Guiqing apprenticed to Gai Jiaotian and performed "Journey to the West" at the Great World. After Zhang Yipeng, he joined the Great Stage to fill Yipeng's vacancy and continued to perform "Journey to the West." His art is also very good. Zhang Yipeng is Gai Jiaotian's eldest son. He became famous for singing "Journey to the West" and relied on this one play at the Great Stage for four or five years. Yipeng's monkey focuses on the small movements of the monkey: scratching his head, moving his eyebrows, shrugging his shoulders, retracting his legs, and his demeanor when entering and exiting the stage. He is truly an ape.</p>
<p>Guo Kunquan comes from a family of actors. His grandfather, Guo Xiuhua, and his father, Guo Diexian, were both famous actors in their time. His childhood stage name was Guo Zhangyang. He has a solid foundation in short and long fighting roles. The two plays "Cutting Zidu" and "Jiepai Pass" can dominate the North and South. It is a pity that he has fallen into the amusement park because of his short stature and hoarse voice. I once watched his monkey opera "Golden Knife Formation," which is based on Zheng Faxiang's style. His hands, eyes, ears, techniques, and steps are all good. The most commendable thing is that he can flip down from a table with the chair and sit upright at the edge of the stage, with accurate footing and a beautiful posture. I have never seen a second person do it.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhang Yunlou, Gao Xueqiao, Li Zhonglin, Jia Binhou, and Yuan Xiaolou have all performed "Journey to the West." Zhang Yunlou was at the Old Gengxin; Gao Xueqiao replaced Gai Jiaotian at the Gong Stage; Li Zhonglin performed "Journey to the West" at the New World, and his name was still Xiaoxiaoguiyu. At that time, he could still sing old male roles. I also heard him sing "Feast of the Courtiers" at the Du Ancestral Hall fair.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yipeng's Sun Wukong</h3>
<h3>Drama News</h3>
<p>— Juexin</p>
<p>Because Kunqu opera singer Han Suqiu is sick and on leave, and Chen Hefeng and Yun Yanxia are also leaving the Tianchan Stage, the authorities feel a lack of female leads. To remedy this, they plan to borrow the Kunqu opera actress Mao Jianqiu from Xun Huisheng's troupe during their performance period at the Gengxin Stage, and then return her to Gengxin when Zhang Yipeng performs the two-part "New Journey to the West" again. The two sides have already had a round of consultations. If Jianqiu herself does not object, there may be no problem.</p>
<p>Martial arts actor Liang Huichao has accepted the Gengxin Stage's invitation to go south and departed on the Xin Beijing ship on the sixth. He is scheduled to arrive today. Gengxin has assigned staff members to welcome him at the Taikoo Wharf. After joining Gou Huisheng's troupe, Huichao will join the performance of the two-part "Journey to the West."</p>
<h3>The View of Life Through Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zongyu</p>
<p>Optimism in struggle is not blind faith in divine power, not belief in natural changes, not arrogance, and even less deliberate pretense, but rather finding a true foothold for optimism. This kind of foothold can indeed be a weapon for struggle.</p>
<h3>Blood and Two Beautiful Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Red Skirt Hates the Pomegranate Flower</p>
<p>Seeing that the two horses were facing each other, separated by just over ten paces, Red Maiden suddenly took out something from her waist, twisted her willow waist, and threw it at Li Xin's head. It was the red brocade lasso she was good at using. Li Xin was not prepared for this move and could not dodge in time. The lasso fell straight down and landed right on his body. As soon as he said, "Not good!" Red Maiden quickly tightened the lasso in her hand and bound Li Xin, then pulled him hard into her arms, saying, "Come here!" Li Xin fell off his horse, and several bandits immediately rushed forward and captured him. Li Xin's retainers stepped forward to save him, but were stopped by Red Maiden. The magistrate of Qi County and Xu Jing saw Li Xin's loss and shouted in unison. Xu Jing wanted to leave the city to rescue him, but the magistrate of Qi County feared that the bandits would take advantage of the situation to attack the city and refused to let him go. Just when they were at a loss, they suddenly saw Red Maiden leading her troops to retreat completely, and the siege of Qi County was lifted. This made the magistrate of Qi County and Xu Jing and others confused, unable to guess the bandits' intentions. Li Xin was captured by the bandits and did not expect to return alive, allowing the bandits to mistreat him. Red Maiden gathered her troops and returned to Qingfeng Mountain, instructing two bandits to treat Li Xin well and send him to the upper room. She then went inside to rest. Li Xin was escorted by the two men to a beautiful guest room. The two men untied the ropes on his body, restoring his freedom, and then retreated outside. Before long, they brought up exquisite dishes and wine and food, filling a table. Li Xin felt very hungry at this time, so he sat down at the table without ceremony and had a big meal. After eating, the bandits took away the leftovers and brought a bathtub and two buckets of bathwater, inviting Li Xin to take a bath. Li Xin felt uncomfortable, and since someone was serving him to bathe, he readily agreed. After bathing, someone brought a new set of clothes for him to change into. After he was seated, someone brought fragrant tea and lit a censer. Li Xin found it strange that the bandits treated him so well. Weren't the bandits here to attack the county? Why did they take me as a prisoner and retreat with their troops? They captured me alive and did not kill me, but treated me so well. What were they thinking? Now I am trapped in a bandit's den, and I don't know how it will end. As he sat alone in doubt, he suddenly heard footsteps approaching and a great man walked in. Looking closely, it was none other than Tong Tianbao, Red Maiden's elder brother.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Shanghai Harmonica Concert</h3>
<p>— Zhudong</p>
<p>The Shanghai Harmonica Society's third anniversary concert at the Carlton Theatre the day before yesterday morning was quite successful. The five ensemble pieces, two quintets, and three solo pieces were all of a fairly average standard. Comparatively speaking, the ensemble "Going to War" and the solo "Heaven and Hell" were the most popular, proving that the majority of the audience still prefers works with an upward meaning.</p>
<p>There were two musicians, one movie star, and one choir who provided assistance. Professor Mei Ye's violin solo and blind musician Wu Shaorong's piano solo both demonstrated a high level of technical skill. Bai Hong's solo was very popular, and it was also quite interesting to have the harmonica band accompany her.</p>
<p>The Experimental Music Society's choir showed even more progress. Although it was only a small group, they sang very movingly. "Cuckoo" is already a work we are used to hearing. Who wouldn't feel a kind of warmth when they hear the cry of "Coo-coo-coo-coo—the suffering is coming to an end, spring is near"?</p>
<p>Due to the success of this concert, it is said that the Shanghai Harmonica Society has an "ambitious plan" to hold another concert soon.</p>
<p>If realized, I hope there will be improvements to the stage setup.</p>
<h3>America's "New Respect" for Greece</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>Greece rose up to resist Italy and won repeatedly, so the world cannot help but look at it differently. The United States expressed great sympathy for Greece's resistance. The American film industry authorities also notified all film companies that all films mentioning Greeks must be treated with new respect. All companies have been ordered to implement this. For example, in the Republic Pictures' new film "Sis Hopkins," there is a Greek who runs a vaudeville theater named Kopopolis, which has been revised. According to the company's announcement, the revised Kopopolis is still a vaudeville theater operator, but the role has been written as a more respectable character. In another Republic film, "Rookies on Parade," there is a Greek gambler named Nick, who wins all the money when people gamble with him. After the authorities notified them to respect Greeks, the role was rewritten. The gambler is still a gambler, but he has been changed to gamble with soldiers in the film and loses every time.</p>
