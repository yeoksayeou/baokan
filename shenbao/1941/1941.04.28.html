<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐局述感</h3>
<p>好像春天是特別利於侵略行動的季節，歷數近幾年問的歐洲歷史，幾乎每年的納粹都在這季節有一度勝利的演出：例如一九三八有併奧之役，一九三九有併捷之役，及至去年在西綫戰爭獲得大勝之後，其成就似乎已達巔峯，然而經過將近一年緊張的相持，今年的巴爾幹戰爭依然又是納粹獲得軍事上的成就，這幾天整個世界正爲這一新的變動感到震撼，在侵略者的躊躇滿志當中。愛好正義的人士更加重了心頭的重壓。</p>
<p>說歷史是盲目的，人類始終是在進化；說一切發展是合理的，其間却父不斷有停滯抑或逆轉的現象發生。其實這兩種趨勢並非相互矛盾衝突，而是後者僅爲一時的現象，前者則爲整個的歸趨。歷史上不斷有所謂黑暗時代存在，但是成吉思汗的征伐與神聖同盟的綫治却都是轉瞬成空，並也只有暫時的效果。何况在從前的時代，人類只能不識不知，到這科學昌明人智發達的今天，則已經逐漸具有創造合理歷史的自覺和信心。暴力與重兵縱能摧破馬奇諾防綫，却未必會能衝毀世界人類共同心理的堅强壁壘，這是世人不應因爲看到種種不快意現象而驟形悲觀的重大理由。</p>
<p>就最近事實方面來看，在整個的黑暗與混亂籠罩之下也未嘗沒有若干光明的因素存在。南斯拉夫與希臘的抗戰相繼失敗了，這失敗是光榮的；英法聯軍更加上馬奇諾防綫且不足以遏阻納粹的攻勢，以此期之於南希小國，爲願豈非過奢？但是南希軍民並不以瘠土寡民而喪其勇氣，也不因若干大小國家的相繼屈服而委曲求全，他們只知道領土主權不容侵犯，不自由　寗死！南斯拉夫在先天上本有與捷克斯拉夫具有同樣民族龐雜的弱點，允其自匈羅保國相繼投入軸心之後，四面遭受包圍，早已註定了失敗的悲運，他們並不因此視屈服爲當然，寗自甘受一戰而敗的痛苦，絕不以不戰而降求瓦全，這種精精是塞爾維亞民族能於淪於異族千載而後重得復興的動力，同時也是這一國家終於不能從歐洲地圖上抹去的有力保障。至於希臘，持與戰前的比利時相較，除却國土比較廣袤而外，無論產業軍備都望塵莫及，甚至連人口文化政治和國民經濟也都遠有遜色，然而這决德希戰爭所經歷的時日已較去春德比之戰更長，德方損失也更大，戰到最後，希臘政府並不學步比王的輕棄戰友去納款投降，而蒙塵海外繼續作戰，這至低限度會使侵略者領略弱小國家的勇氣和意志非盡可侮，他們建立「新秩序」的工作還是步步荊棘。</p>
<p>以這幾年納粹的「春季勝利」相比較，併奧併捷都是不戰而勝，恰符合侵略者的最高理想；去春的西綫勝利最足驚人，但是付出了重大的代價。至於此度巴爾幹之戰，則是經過長時期的慘淡經營，最後始被迫而出於以實力相週旋，以此對付戰具落後的希臘，倉卒應戰的英軍，其終於獲得戰勝，不只非出世人意外，且亦無驚人戰績足言。從去夏西綫戰事結束至今十個月中，納粹對外並未建立値得誇耀的戰功，義大利的連戰皆北且大爲軸心聲勢之累，則此一勝利，以對內意義言，自然是納粹所急切需求，雖其對於整個戰局的價値還是另一問題。</p>
<p>德軍在巴爾幹的成就只有局部勝利的意義，全局的勝負得失則猶有待於未來主力的角逐，但經過最近一年間的演進，全世界反侵略陣綫的佈置已遠較前此周密和堅强，第一，海上得失是最重要的因素，全世界的海權至今依然爲民冶國家所控制，不只在地中海大西洋，即在太平洋亦復如此，第二，美國對於反浸略戰爭的關切和援助適與侵略陣綫的進展成幾何級數而增强，預料其未來措施將不僅以擴張大西洋巡邏範圍與對華金融貸款爲止境；第三，已往的綏靖政策殆已絕其根株，那一幻想，無論在歐洲或遠東均已無存在餘地，另一方面，也就是根本消滅了侵略者不戰而勝的可能。</p>

<h3>美國之金融問題及其措施</h3>
<p>— 周璡</p>
<p>本文原係滬江大學商學院秘書周　先生允中國國民經濟研究所之請，爲該所第三回續編『中外經濟年報』國外之部所撰。全文分財政，金融，工業，貿易等節；對於今日美國之經濟趨勢，頗多獨到見解；而其敘述周詳，猶其餘事。值茲中美貨幣合作實現之初，對於美國金融現勢，必爲讀者所樂聞，茲徵得作者與所方之同意，特將其中金融一節，先行發表於是，俾讀者得先觀之快。特誌數行，以謝作者與所方。——編者</p>
<p>一九四〇年的美國金融界，有幾點值得注意！第一，全國銀行業有著好轉的現象；第二，爆發後隨著發生通貨膨脹的恐慌；第三，黃金過剩成爲更嚴重的問題，第四，防止德國攫取佔領國的資金，乃有凍結外資的措置。現在就這四項分別加以敘述。</p>
<p>（一）銀行業的平靜景象　就大體說，美國銀行業在去年仍有好轉的現象；但若細加分析，則亦不免有種種的困難和痛苦。首論銀行的家數，比前幾年都要少些，但這是受著前年底銀行停業較多的影響，並非去年銀行業有什麼不振的情形。反之，去年裡停業的銀行，較以前任何年爲少，這也可以想見銀行業的沒有什麼重大困難。下面是近三年來營業銀行與停業銀行的家數表：</p>
<p>（甲）營業銀行統計表</p>
<p>（乙）停業銀行統計局</p>
<p>（注）表中所列的銀行家數，都是因遇財政困難而暫時或永遠停業的。若在停業時所有債務已由他行承認者概未列入。至於存款數額，則凡會員銀行與已保險的非會員銀行，都以停業那天為准，未保險的非會員銀行，則以得到停業報告時最後資料為准。</p>
<p>再看各銀行的準備情形，大抵是實存額超過必需額頗大（見下表）。這在銀行本身自然是一種鞏固的表現，但對社會則不免引起信用膨脹的惶慮，因為普通商業銀行，每準備金一元，可以放款三元五角，準備金既然過剩，自然就有信用膨脹的可能。</p>
<p>一九四〇年十二月份會員銀行存在聯邦準備銀行的準備金</p>
<p>最後說到業務方面，各行的存款數額及放款與投資數額均有增加，不過存款的增加率較放款等投資的增加率更大，以致過剩準備成為更嚴重的問題。各銀行都因存款增加而有無從運用的煩惱，結果使銀行利率降至有史以來的最低點。</p>
<p>全體銀行的存款放款與投資數額表</p>
<p>（二）通貨膨脹問題　因國防經費激增而國庫虧空愈大，因二次大戰爆發而物價上昇頗烈，美國人士就都擔心到通貨膨脹這一危機。但據專家觀察，這危機是不難消免的。</p>
<p>先就國庫虧空一節檢討，依照美國一班金融家的見解，政府增加貨幣的方法，或爲發行紙幣，或爲出售公債給聯邦準備銀行或商業銀行，驟聞固屬可懼，但實際上常爲政府支出超過收入的數額所限制。而且參考成例，貨幣總額的增加，常政府虧空的數額爲小，其彌補方法，可以不必發行紙幣或售公債給銀行，但將公債售給公眾，即可免受膨脹的影響。美國現存貨幣爲六百五十萬萬元，政府虧空的數目，若僅在五十萬萬以內，則決不致膨脹，必待大至百萬萬元以上，始有此種恐懼。按美國最近三年的政府預算，不敷之數已由一九三九——四〇年度的三十六萬萬元，增至一九四〇——四一年度的六十二萬萬元，及一九四一——四二年度的九十二萬萬元，將來若仍一再加大，則通貨膨脹這一問題，恐亦隨這而增大其嚴重性。</p>
<p>再就物價上昇這一節檢討，當一九三九年秋歐戰爆發時，各種主要商品突然飛漲，這完全是因投機而激起的結果，所以爲時甚暫，物價又跌了下來，不過在去年最後兩月，則又稍有回漲的趨勢。但美國因政府人民的協力，可將貨物供給增加，而使物價不至過於飛漲。目前美財部已握有大量的產品，其中假手物產信用公司而放出的無擔保借款，計有棉花九百五十萬包，穀類五萬萬蒲式耳，小麥一萬萬蒲式耳，並其他物品很多；又假手聯邦剩餘貨物公司而得有多量的油脂和牛油，將來如遇膨脹發生，即可利用這些貨物去壓低物價。且美國爲設立汎美經濟國防起見，盡量購取南美各國的特產如石油，小麥，咖啡，棉花等等，這些東西在美國並無銷路，現在把牠們儲藏起來，將來也可以制止通貨膨脹。此外，美政府統制物價的權力，在上次大戰時已曾運用有效，此次亦頗有重加運用的趨勢，所以通貨膨脹這一問題，或可藉上述種種措置而得以平靜解決。</p>
<p>（三）黃金過剩問題　近五六年來，世界黃金不斷地流入美國，使美國現有黃金佔世界黃金現存量的百分之七十以上，因而發生種種關於黃金過剩的憂慮，這可說是經濟界的怪現象。美國黃金過剩的造因很多，概括地說，一九三一年的英磅貶值，和一九三四年的美元貶值，都足鼓勵黃金生產，而歐亞兩洲戰爭的發生，則更使日本及歐洲各國的存金，因欲易取軍需或求安全保存而深源運往美國；此外，若美國海外投資的收回，及國際貿易出超的償付等，亦在使黃金輸入美國。下表乃表明美國存金的變化情形。</p>
<p>近七年來美國的存金及金進口數值表</p>
<p>（注一）一九三四年一月照金價每盎斯二〇·六七元計算，以後則照每盎斯三十五元計算。</p>
<p>（注二）包括呆滯賬中的黃金計一九三六年底值二七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，一九三七年底值一，二二八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>係預計數</p>
<p>從上表中我們可以看出黃金在最近兩個流入美國最多。據美國聯邦準備局的報告，此次歐戰爆發後，黃金流入美國的數值，較以前任何同時期爲大，自一九三九年八月底到一九四〇年底止，其進口五十八萬萬元。其中約有七萬萬元仍由聯邦準備銀行指定為輸出國政府或中央銀行所有，其餘則增爲美國存金的因此存金數值，包括國內金產在內，在戰爭期中增加五十三萬萬元，而至一九四〇年底竟達二百二十萬萬元。</p>
<p>由黃金過多而引起的憂慮，最主要者有二：一恐準備過剩，將造成信用膨脹，使物價及生活費用均起變化；二恐將來德國佔勝，永廢金爲貨幣本位，致黃金失其價值。關於這兩點，前一點固已有這趨勢，所幸美國國內工業原料及食糧等均甚豐富，而政府人民又知維持市面責任的重大，或可免生不良的結果。至於後一點，則頗有以為金乃最良的幣材，決不至於永遠廢棄，而且戰事停止後，歐洲各國勢將取回資金，以圖復興，所以黃金必能重見其重要。不過見智見仁，亦各有各的理由罷了。</p>
<p>關於解救“黃禍”的辦法，建議很多，如停購一切黃金，頭像金價或課稅以限制黃金流入，訂立國際協定以減少金生產，廢除黃金私有限制，回復金幣流通，增加銀行存款法定準備率，對與國貨出黃金，……等等，不一而足，但還沒有一定的對策。將來變化如何，只好留待後日看了。</p>
<p>（四）凍結外資的實施　一九三九年九月德波開戰後，歐洲各弱小國家多被德國所局部或全部佔領，美國爲抑制軸心國保衛民主國起見，羅斯福總統乃根據一九一七年十月六日美國所頒布大戰法令總統有下令禁止國內資金外流之權的規定，於去年四月起，將德國所佔領的幾國在美資金陸續予以凍結，免爲德國所攫取。茲將各國的開始凍結日期及凍結資金數額，列表如後：（單位美金百萬元）</p>
<p>拉特維亞，立陶宛，愛索尼亞三國，係於一九四〇年五月爲蘇俄所佔領。</p>
<p>除上表所列者外，傳聞美國尚批租凍結德義日各軸心國的存美資金。據合眾社華盛頓今年二月四日電稱，估計德國在美存款爲美金一一三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，義國在美存款爲美金八二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，兩共美金二萬萬元弱。最近又傳羅斯福總結將於國會通過援助民主國法案後，繼續凍結英國希臘中國及中南美各國在美的資金。不過美國凍結挪荷盧比等國的資金，皆在防止上列諸國存美資金，有被德義攫取或利用方法獲得美國或第三國物資以維持其侵略戰的可能，所以凍結非常嚴厲；至欲凍結各民主國的資金，雖然也在防止有被軸心國利用的危機，但凍結之後，民主國如需動用，仍可憑著美財部審核土法項來源用途後所發的提款執照，隨時向美提用，所以兩者是逈不相同的。</p>

<h3>中國之經濟戰略</h3>
<p>— 李總明</p>
<p>“續自由中國之經建設”</p>
<p>據中國經濟部長公網文灝博士宣稱，中國政府對日之經濟封鎖，已因下列三種辦法之實施，而卓著成效焉：</p>
<p>（一）中國政府爲擊破日人“以戰養戰”政策，首先於一九三九年八月頒布各地物產禁運條例，禁止物資運入淪陷區，此種物資計包括兩類，一爲製造軍火之原料品，如棉花，煤，食鹽，以及金屬鑛砂等；一爲日人取得後，可以出口以換取外滙者，如皮革，羊毛，豬鬃大豆等。此後政府又通令各政治軍事以及海關之當局，禁止六十餘種物資私運入淪陷區，並設水　辦事處，負責稽查。此外政爲積極防止一切資源爲日人利用起見，一方面令國際貿易委員會以及農本局，儘量採購各地之物資，以供輸出，軍事或人民日常之用；另一主齋則勸告淪陷區之人民，改變其生產事業，或減少生產，僅求其足供消費即已。一九三八年淪陷區中運往日本之物品，共值一一六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，至一九三九年已減至六六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元矣，其成效如何！已不言可喻！</p>
<p>（二）政府為撲滅走私，特公布法令，抵制各種日本以及其殖民地製造之貨物入境：此種法令，並適用於淪陷區中日人所開設之工廠以及在日人控制下之華人工廠，此種措施，乃使日人對於中國法幣以及其他物資之攫取，不能予取予求。但我政府當局並不忽視對國內民眾一般必需品之供給問題，因之對各種小工藝及小工業，極力獎勵提倡。又上述之抵制日貨事宜，並不限於國內；即在南洋一帶以及世界其他各地之一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇各僑胞中，亦嚴格推行；其他愛好和平之國家，如英，美，印度，及澳洲人士，亦能激於正義，發起抵制日貨之運動，更足令人爲之興奮。</p>
<p>（三）發動廣泛之遊擊戰爭，以從事於淪陷區中經濟之破壞工作，日本於一九三九年中，輸入淪陷於中的貨物，為三一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，較之一九三七年之一五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元與一九三八年之二〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，其增加之速，頗足驚人！但日人對淪陷區中輸出之增加，亦不能遽認為日人之福，在今日情形之下，日貨輸入淪陷區後，其所得爲軍用票而百外滙，但其自身製造貨物所用之原料，則非用外滙向國外購買不可。故今日日人對淪陷區輸出之增加，無異於以外滙投資於中國，此種投資除非俟淪陷區中之秩序恢復，以中國之原料，供給其國內之需要，使其工業之輸，得以旋轉不息，則對之終鮮有利之機會也。</p>
<h3>統制經濟談片</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>茲先解釋三個名詞：（一）工團主義，希望產生一個經濟同盟的理想組織，和各種產業界所組織的產業評議會調和一處，庶可此組織達到穩固。（二）基爾特社會義，是希望全國產業有集中的組織，使生產的地位與消費的地位，能在統一的立場上，（三）世界工人會，是以世界產業各部門的活動形成統制，然後把各門聯合起來，此聯合的組織，用來代替各部門，至於這三種縘的目標爲：（一）以社會的經濟組織放在新的理想上，而反對舊有組織，（二）與上述的一種思想相反對的爲保守主義。保守主義不欲推翻此種制度，因保守主義與民主主義有密切關係，在保守主義之下，經濟上的利益，由國會所支配的，直到經濟上的缺點發生後，所以社會上的改革家，以地域選舉議會來參加職業選舉，在德國乃有俾士麥的提議，國會應參加此種議會，他希望社會的保險法，能在議會中通過，由他的努力，後來形成職業選舉代表。在義大利亦產生同樣的結果，由此可知，俾士麥亦爲保守主義者。（三）所謂其他方式代表國家的組織，但此種思想產生在各國的反政府黨思想家所造成，他們常攻擊議會制度的缺點，批評民主主義的無能，而認為應由職業團體去支配，實際的生活，以上三種思想，可說造成統制經濟思想的淵源。</p>
<p>統制經濟的產生，在各國既不同，因此所採取的組織及組織的權力當然不同的，以各國組織的相同點看，其組織採取委員制度，委員的產生爲本國的公民，而大半屬於職業團體的領袖，人類在法國的經濟評議會中有四十八人，德國有三二六人，其他各國不等，任期自二年至六年，其產生可分為四種：（一）由職業團體自由選出而形成，（二）由職業團體推選而再由政府任命，（三）由政府指派全國有關系的職業代表或專家組成，（四）由政府指派有關系的行政人員而形成，此種統制經濟組織的產生由於機構背景及法律上的權力不同，因此其組織的性質又可分為三種：（一）計劃執行機關，蘇聯並非有計劃的權能，而能有統制全國實業的權力。（二）代表制的顧問機關，爲全國所組成，能幫助政府推行統制經濟政策，（三）任命制的諮訽機關，由政府所推選的專家而組成。</p>

<h3>米限價將撤消　米號態度</h3>

<p>把持米價情節愈顯</p>
<p>據熟悉米市者語人稱、本市米價之續趨上升、純係一般較大米行堅持棧貨所致、若輩向海外辦來食米、成本頗爲低廉、惟屢次利用時機、抬價　利、故本市整個民食、至於今日局面、、豆米行業暨雜糧業各委員咎無可辭、如此次當局以善意向上述兩業公會敦勸、與當局合作採辦香港政府所供給之廉價米、詎料該兩公會委員以一旦採辦該項米糧、非特無厚利可圖、且將影響其所囤巨額米糧之嗣後限價、竟斷然拒絕、可見若輩居心、務望當局予以嚴厲制裁、</p>

<h3>追懷謝晋元將軍</h3>
<p>— 繼澤</p>
<p>昔日以忠勇戰績，受全世界人士欽佩的謝晋元將軍，今日正懷着求酬的壯志，被害不起了。他的眼雖閉了，可是我們仍能見到神采四射的眼光；他的口雖停住說話了，可是他底沉毅壯烈的演說，仍在我們的耳際縈　；雖然我們不能再見到他騎在馬上的雄姿，但我們的眼睛中，却一些不含糊　可以看見他仍揮着指揮刀，我們永　相信他是被害了。—他是水生的他永遠地在這世上，領導着我們。</p>
<p>從孤軍營出來，揉着淚眼，抬　望天，天正哭喪着臉，我懷着沉鬱的情緒回家。</p>
<p>寫字檯上玻璃板下，正壓着一張我自己替他攝取的全身照片，那是三年前的事了；</p>
<p>二十七年夏際，我正攻讀新聞學，在我們教授領導之下，我們三十多同學，開始集體訪問四行孤軍。在一閒陳設簡單的小會客室裏，謝晋元將軍熱誠地接見了我們，我們圍繞着他，他穿着白襯衫，熱誠地答復我們同學的問語，他底沉毅而有力的廣東官話，很容易打動我們的心弦。我們結束了談話後，我要求他元許我攝張照，他慨然允諾；我就在會客窒外，攝得了將軍的全身　。誰知道現在，竟成了他的遺影！他是不幸被害而　長眠不起了。</p>
<p>我第二次訪問將軍，是在同年的雙十節，在雙十節前，孤軍營因紀念日扯　問題，竟遭駐守的白俄十涉，不幸釀成了流　事件。將軍被遷居外灘通商銀仃樓上，復被拒絕接見外人，是爲將　畢牛認為最痛苦的遭遇。復經交涉，將軍始於雙十節前，得獲自由。他同我暢談事變的經過，又在一本大而厚的貼報簿匕，翻查出有力的證據，表示租界當局的誤會。並且說明他的意志，他是竭力避免一切無謂的糾紛；但若以强暴加諸他身上時，則他將作正　的反抗，絲毫小會畏縮的。</p>
<p>以後，我時常在孤軍營走動，我拍攝過孤軍營的生活照片，我曾向親友徵集人批舊書報，充實孤軍壯士的精神食糧。但我更喜歡和將軍談話，半爲了他的熱誠懇切，半爲了他的豐富的智慧。他詢問我上海新聞界的一切，其　我祇不過是一個新聞學的學習者，我能懂得什麽？結果反是他給予我不少的學識。</p>
<p>將軍不僅是勇武，他還是個好學不倦的博學者，這是每個會同將軍晤談的人，所共認的他的案　，高疊着許多書籍，我記得我請他在紀念册是題詞時，他隨手以孫子兵法中的「好戰窮武未小滅亡者也「一句贈我；字體矯健不覊，可見將軍之能揚名叫海，原不是僥倖得之的。</p>
<p>就是那年年底，我因職務關係，離開了上海，而到浙東；我到孤軍營道別時，他勉勵我　多話，正如一位循循善誘的良師一樣。</p>
<p>在我離開上海以前，我竟因一時的疏忽，而致將軍遭到一件失望的事；這件事，眞使我一生對他抱着無限的歉意。去年夏，我重回上海，第一件事，我就跑釗他那里去自承過失；他竟毫不介意，反矢口否認是由我的疏忽所引起的；並叫我不要心存芥蒂，叫我時常跑　他那裏去玩。這倒反使我不好　思起來。</p>
<p>但是不幸得很，將軍竟慘遭部下叛兵的毒手了！不，他的肉體雖亡，他的靈魂是永生的，永遠不會消滅的！</p>

<h3>天外天</h3>
<p>— 景谷</p>
<p>宇宙是一個神秘的東西，它常被人們懷疑着，沒有科學頭腦的古人們說它是一個神主宰着的，二十世紀最前進的科學家則說它是無止境地一日膨脹下去的……這且不要管它</p>
<p>我要說的是「天外天」，看看名兒似乎奇怪，其實，拆穿西洋鏡，一個大錢也不値。</p>
<p>蓋「天外天」者同溫　以外之天也！</p>
<p>同溫層該是一個很普遍的詞兒了，簡單說米，就是離地面六到十哩這一個空間，據測，這空間的溫度　是　氏零下五十度，因此就叫它同溫層了。</p>
<p>在同溫層，因爲空氣的稀薄，所以非帶氧氣上去就不能生存的。可是，在同溫層以十，空氣是格外稀薄了，簡直人就不能上去，因此科學家就想出一個辦法來，在氣球上裝了必要的機件，而由它來紀錄那裏的情况。</p>
<p>有趣的事情來了，大家以爲（甚至最前進科學家高空愈上昇，溫度愈是降低，可是，据「機械」報吿，從回溫層向上，溫度便開始上昇，一直到離地面一百英里的地方。那地方的溫度一直高到攝氏九白度，是一團熾熱的熱殼，無綫電波的能射遠便也因爲　波向上射時降到熱殼層，便折向下射（和光的反射相同）因此，雷波便如此向遠地方播送去了。</p>
<p>根　這「報吿」，我們可以推論出，就是科學家們竭力地絞腦汁想和火星和其他星球上的「人」通往來的事，現在是證明絕對不可能了；因爲我們「人」要想通過這近乎攝氏一千度的熱殼是不可能的啊！</p>
<h3>建議一種新服裝—智慧裝</h3>
<p>— 祺齋</p>
<p>現在社會上的人士，因爲感到中裝（指長袍）有計多缺點，所以改穿西裝（指便服，中山裝和學生裝）的日見普遍，我朋友中幾乎有半數是穿西裝的，就是我自己也穿過十多年。不過西裝是不是一種完善的服裝呢？這問題我曾和許多朋友袒白的討論過，大家認爲西裝除了用料經濟，行走便利，口袋多之外並無其他優點。中裝除了用料不經濟，做事行走不便利，口袋少之外也有許多優點。</p>
<p>這兒我建議一種新的服裝，名稱擬定爲「智慧裝」，是去中西裝之短，集兩者之長而設計成功的，極合作便裝穿用。</p>
<p>（見附圖）現在一一說明於後，還請高明指敎。</p>
<p>這「智慧裝」的長度只到膝部上面二　寸，（市尺）比現在流行的西裝大衣還短着五六寸，這樣行動方面和西裝同樣便利，比西裝溫暖，却省下了中裝的前後兩大塊衣料。袖子長度只到手腕，袖口大小在四守左右，這都和西裝一樣，可使做事非常便利。肩部裁法照中式，因爲我們兩臂完全下垂的時間極少，就是最少勞動的書寫工作的人，兩臂也不完全下垂的。不過若做厚的衣服（如棉衣）可把腋部的一塊棉絮除去或减至極薄，這樣在完全下垂的時候也不覺不適，而舉起來的時候就不受牽制了。領高頸長的三份之二，前面蛟低，可採用學生裝式，也宜裝一對扣子，使觀瞻方面更齊整。襟採取直襟式，可省些衣料；所以不取普通中式短服的對襟式，那是要和這種短服有些分別，來適應「自別於非知識界」的心理，這種心理是人類自尊心的表現，不必阻止的。腰身相當大，所以動作非常便利，也很舒適，夏天又凉爽，而且極合衛生。下擺可和腰身同樣大，左右兩面開幾寸跨，使走起路來更覺便利。鈕子用結子或機製的都可以。袋可隨意裝，在外面也不妨。褲子也採用中國式，雖然腰身方面用料比西裝褲多些，但穿的時間加起了一倍，還是合算的。上衣所以設計得那樣長，也爲要遮掩褲襠部份。褲脚管不要太大，脚管口只要七寸左右便可。長度齊脚踝，比西裝褲短着一二寸</p>
<p>這「智慧裝」的裁法完全採用中裝方法，非常簡單，就是要請人家做，工資也比西裝便宜。</p>
<p>我是不會畫圖的，所以不能把「智慧裝」的美點都表現出來。但也能的略見到穿這「智慧裝」的頗氣慨，頗雅觀，並無痿靡不振的樣子，也沒粗野之氣，至多因爲沒看慣，有些不順眼而已。</p>
<p>我敬將這種又經濟又便利父舒適的服裝，貢獻給講求實際而富於改革性的知識份子。</p>
<h3>蠶豆子</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>季節吿許我們，又快紅了櫻桃，綠了芭蕉了。唯一可口的食品—蠶豆子—又上市了。</p>
<p>蠶豆子是出於蠶豆蛻化的佳果。蠶豆，（Vicia　faba）植物名，豆科，越年生草本，高　三尺，莖方，中空，羽狀，複葉，小葉四片至六片，長　圓形，莖葉柔軟多汁，春日葉腋開花，花白色，有紫黑斑紋，蝶形花冠，短總狀花序，果實爲莢，常向上，種子供食用，或供釀造醬，及醬油之原料，莖葉充肥料，及飼家畜之用，小小蠶豆，用途却非常之廣。</p>
<p>故鄕（無錫）之著名蠶豆子，第一是　橋鄕，惠山，第二是榮巷等一帶，每晨田家兒女，担之上市者，肩摩踵接，蠶豆子，　豆莢，滿筐滿籃，爲農人家惟一的大好副業，農家女子高喚着「豆子要　！……的鶯　嚦嚦可聽。那錢橋豆子，圓綠可愛，粒粒如翠寶，而且絕嫩。戰前每觔豆子，僅售銅元十多枚，每觔豆莢，僅售銅元六七枚，（不到三分）故家庭主婦買而作閑食的，無足爲奇，烹以濃醬，　糖，嫩糯味雋！眞足大快朵頤，不僅供佐餐之需。如今百物橫漲，想見此碧綠蠶百子，身價大異往昔。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>近一月來，我們本來常把價格比較便宜的黃魚，作爲每犬的葷菜之一，雖然吃得有些厭了，可是葷腥終是葷腥，每天少不了它。不道寗波一失陷，價格漲起了兩倍，並且也不大看見血淋淋的新鮮貨了。其他的魚呢，每兩總在一角以外，小小的一尾魚，一下子就是七六角，眞的使人有「食無魚」之歎。也罷，便宜的鮮魚旣不易吃到，那麽每星期中，且吃幾次鹹黃魚鹹帶魚鹹鮝魚等醃貨吧。鹹雖鹹，畢竟還可以下飯，並且可以使你筷下留情，少吃一些了。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>茭菜炒肉絲　糖醋鹹帶魚　葱花蘿蔔絲</p>

<h3>長沙的黃包車</h3>
<p>— 中沛</p>
<p>行任長沙，唯一的工具」是黃包車；然而如果你初到長沙的話，那你便可以覺得那裏的黃包車，該是一切地方黃包車中的「太歲」，動不動就會受他們的閒氣。所以住在長沙的人，往往勸初來的朋友，別輕易去嘗試，免得無中生有地去「動土」，討一個沒趣。</p>
<p>這唯一的特點，是車夫不肯跑路，當你坐上他的車，他便會給你慢　斯理的踱起方步來，一步步的不跑也不急走。要是你不耐煩而催他，他高興，來一個置之不理，依舊走着。如果也一不高興，或是你屢次的慛他，他便會乾脆的停下，請你下車，說「你自己跑罷，咱不幹這事」，也不問你耍錢，也不收你賞錢，祇是隨着你，看你跑也不跑，然後問你你爲什麽目己不跑……這還算好的。更有惡劣的，你去催他，他　你下來，自己坐上，來要你替他拉跑的，使你來一個哭笑不得的對他無可奈何！</p>
<p>有時你要他跑呢，也有，不過須在事前講明要跑，這代價須在一倍以上，而應募的也十之一二而已。至於一下雨，那跑是決沒有的了，你想一個手拿湖南油傘，足登杜製木屐的太爺，那能替你拉着跑呢？</p>
<p>此外更餓不二價的特色，當一個車夫已說過二角，那決沒有另一個車夫開口一毛八的，這也是旁的地方所沒有的。其他如一個車夫今天已村得相當代價之後，決不願史拉一次的習性，這都足以表演出，我們「兵鄕」的固執性。長沙，這十足湖南氣味的長沙的黃包車。</p>

<h3>人之常情</h3>
<p>— 孙坚白</p>
<p>餓了一天了，實在沒個法兒。向人借罷：所認識的朋友都早已給我借了個遍，想來想去，只有個老馬還未曾向他開過口，他是個「流棍」，可是也得試試運。</p>
<p>這傢伙是向來沒有家的，可眞不容易找，亂撞了大半天，才在一家茶館中找到了他。</p>
<p>我對他說了一大堆苦經，最後是懇求他看在老朋友面上，多少幫一點兒忙。</p>
<p>他一面抽着香烟，一面聽着我說話，等我說完了話，他便嘆了口氣，然後把頭搖了幾搖，才向我十分同情似的說：</p>
<p>「老弟！不是我今天說你一句，你這人啊！就是太忠厚了點兒，要不然的話，憑你這個身個子，早隨着我一起混，也不會弄倒這個樣子，偏是你的胆又小，脾氣又這麽强，又怎得不到處吃虧呢！」他說到這裏，停了停口，眼對我注視着，我不覺把頭低了，心裏却直感着不耐：媽的！我是來借錢的，又不是來聽你的敎訓來的，依脾胃就得起身走，可是肚子在咕咕的叫，我只能耐着了。</p>
<p>「不過呢，一個人　尬的時候總有的，你老弟今天旣然來我着我馬某，我也不能叫你空着手兒回去！」他慢慢的說着話，一手在腰袋裏掏出了兩張一元的鈔票，看了看數字便授給了我。</p>
<p>「這兒，是兩塊錢，我的情形你大概也知道，多的錢是沒有的，這一些些只能算我的一些小意思！」</p>
<p>我接過錢，心裏不由得十分的感謝他，我說：</p>
<p>「老馬！眞謝謝你，救了我的急，改天我有了錢一定就還你！」</p>
<p>「那裏話，老弟！自家弟兄謝什麽？不過呢，我以爲，你老是道樣的，找朋友借錢，也不是個辦法，總得弄些事做，是嗎？」他忽然皺起了眉頭說，眼睛看着天，似乎正在替我想法。</p>
<p>「你的話眞不錯，我也道末想，可是我外面走不開，找個事兒眞不容易，一切只能拜託老哥你了！」在外面混了好久，我總算也掙得上這未幾句</p>
<p>「唔，唔，」他抽着烟，又呷着茶，過了一會兒，他忽然打量了一下我的身上，然後開口說：</p>
<p>「老弟，你身上穿的是件什麽袍兒？面子倒還不十分舊。」</p>
<p>「駱駝絨的，說來羞人，我便只有這來一件神仙袍兒了！」我對自己的袍子看了看，想起了家中的十幾張當票，不覺深深的嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「老弟，我現在想到了一個辦法，不知你肯不肯把你身上的袍兒借給我用一用？」他忽然很低聲的對我說，神色十分的興奮。</p>
<p>「什麽辦法呢？要我的袍兒又有什麽用呢？」我十分驚奇的詢問着。</p>
<p>「賺錢的辦法！你知道我是麻將的活手」？不過就是沒了本錢不能跟人家去賭，現在你把袍子晚下來借給我去當道末靠十塊錢，讓我到總會去打一塲牌，贏了錢咱們弟兄對分，保你不出岔兒，就是小知你肯不肯借？信不信我馬某？」他神情很嚴重地說，眼睛看了我。</p>
<p>「那有什麽不信，不過……我遲疑着說，一面腦中很快的在思慮。</p>
<p>「不要緊的，你在你家裏等我好了，我最多三个鐘點，八圈牌快得很的，而且我打完牌就來找你！」</p>
<p>我不能遲疑了，咬了咬牙，便把袍子晚了下來，心裏在想：「老馬總不會在我這尬尷朋友前「打晃兒」罷？竭碰竭的老弟兄！」我心裏這末想着把袍子授給了他。</p>
<p>他接了袍子，便叫茶房來算茶錢，接着，便和我一起走出了茶館。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）　臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>這一點後來他雖然就跟秋海棠說了，可是當天吃過飯以後，那啞丫頭臨走的時節，秋海棠却還不得小對她做了許多手勢，要她在晚上多兜幾個圈于，悄悄地冉溜上　裏米，相幫奶媽照看小梅寶；因爲小梅寶的身上不但有些發燒，而且神志一直很昏迷，據玉崑找來的大夫說，或許要變驚風也說不定。而湘綺這幾天偏是絕對不能回家照料，所以這個啞丫頭倒變成萬不可少的要角了。——儘管她父聾又啞，作事却非常的熱練輕快。</p>
<p>「二哥，跟你商量一件事行不行？」秋海棠看女兒吃過一次藥以後，便和玉崑一起走了出來；快分手的時候，又側過臉去，皺着眉頭，向他輕輕地這樣問。</p>
<p>玉崑聳了聳肩膀，眼睛並不向他看。</p>
<p>「總不致於跟我商量一顆腦袋罷？」</p>
<p>「別打趣！」秋海棠很勉强地笑了一笑。「我看梅竇的病很小輕，她媽又決不能回去看她，我呢，晚上要是給他們大吃大喝大唱的一鬧，也未必一定可以走。好在天樂離袁家很近，你一下戲就到袁家來一次，只說餓事跟我商量，那末咱們就好溜回去了。」</p>
<p>這對於玉崑當然是無有不能應承的，但隨便他怎樣機伶，也料不到後來他上袁家去的時節，偏不是大吃大喝大唱把秋海棠絆住了；在晚上發生的，竟會是那麽　件可怖的意外。</p>
<p>秋海棠才跨進袁家的大門，似乎覺得那個管門的老張很倉皇地向他便了一個眼色，但他和老張牛日向不說話，委實想不出他爲什麽要向自己使眼色；而且門房裏另外還坐着一個聽差和一個馬弁，老張的神氣也顯得非常害怕，又使秋海棠不敢冒昧向他詢問。</p>
<p>「這是什麽意思呢？」他一路躊躇，一路慢慢地走淮裏向去，就在一問袁寶藩平日用爲休息室的屋子裏坐定了，瞧壁上的時鐘，正指着五點三一刻。（九二）</p>

<h3>American Relief Organizations Launch Fundraising Campaign for US$1 Million; Red Cross Ships Large Quantities of Medicine to China; Pearl Buck Involved in Raising Donation Funds</h3>
<p>Washington: The United China Relief Association recently launched a fundraising campaign for US$5 million. According to Blaine, Chairman of the Fundraising Committee of the Preliminary Affairs Committee of the Association, from March 1st to April 3rd, the Association has received donations of US$1,488,121.251 from various sources, including a US$50,000 donation from the Rockefeller Foundation, designated as subsidies for wartime Christian schools in China. It is reported that the United China Relief Association plans to raise US$5 million nationwide by the end of July this year. Seven other organizations are also participating in the fundraising efforts. The funds raised will be used directly to purchase clothing, food, utensils, or medicines for refugee relief, or transferred to China for children's welfare and industrial development, refugee livelihood, and educational programs. In addition, the American Red Cross recently announced that it has shipped a large quantity of medicines to China, including 50 million aspirin tablets, 15.6 million yards of gauze, 454,354 yards of scrim, 140,000 pounds of absorbent cotton, and 112,950 pounds of boric acid.

<h3>U.S. President's Eldest Son to Fly to Chongqing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Captain James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Roosevelt, arrived in Hong Kong at 4:00 PM and is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 29th. After staying for four days, he will proceed to Rangoon to inspect the Burma Road. This move has significant implications for the United States' material aid to China. When James arrived in Hong Kong, Yu Hongjun, representative of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Zhong E, representative of Vice President Kong, welcomed him at the airport. The local authorities here have also prepared a grand welcome for his arrival in Chongqing. (Havas World News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Roosevelt, arrived here by plane this afternoon with Major Thomas. According to Roosevelt's conversation with the reporter of the Central News Agency, this is his first visit to China, so he is eager to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He will stay in Chongqing for four days and then proceed to Burma. When asked about the exact purpose of his visit to China, Roosevelt declined to answer, only stating that he was under strict orders from Washington and that he would remain silent and refrain from commenting. His fellow traveler, Major Thomas, previously worked for the China National Aviation Corporation. It is speculated that the aircraft will be handed over to a British aviation officer to fly to Singapore or Hong Kong. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Roosevelt, arrived here by plane this afternoon accompanied by Major Thomas. According to Roosevelt's statement to the reporter from the Central News Agency, this is his first visit to China, and therefore, he is extremely eager to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He will remain in Chongqing for four days before departing for Burma. When the reporter inquired about the official purpose of his visit to China, Roosevelt avoided answering, merely stating that he was under direct military orders from Washington and was visiting China as an "observer." Future itineraries would be directly instructed by Washington, so it was difficult to make any predictions. The reporter then inquired whether he carried a personal letter from President Roosevelt to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He replied, "I cannot say, as I brought many letters from Washington." After disembarking from the plane, Roosevelt was driven to his residence to rest and then received reporters. The reporters posed many questions, to which Roosevelt responded with humor. One reporter asked whether the U.S. fleet in the Pacific would immediately begin escorting ships. He replied, "It would be best to ask my father about this." Another reporter asked whether it was true that Roosevelt would serve as a military advisor to Chongqing, as claimed by the Japanese. Roosevelt said that he had not heard of this and that he was not very familiar with military affairs. He was only a Marine Corps officer stationed in San Diego and was ordered to come to the Far East as an observer. Tonight, Roosevelt and Thomas will be hosted at a banquet by Yu Hongjun. Roosevelt is scheduled to arrive in Chongqing next Tuesday. (Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Guo Taiqi to Go to Washington, D.C. to Discuss Matters with U.S. Authorities; Song Ziwen Believes Signing of Equalization Agreement Is Concrete Expression of Democratic Nations' Support for China</h3>
<p>Washington: Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, stated yesterday that the trilateral agreement between China, Britain, and the United States on equalization funds shows that "these two major democratic nations of the West are not just friends of China in words only." Song made this statement to reporters after the China, Britain, and United States signed the equalization fund agreement separately to stabilize the Chinese legal tender (fabi). At the same time, Washington is preparing to welcome Guo Taiqi, the former Chinese ambassador to Britain, en route from Chongqing to assume the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Guo's itinerary here includes discussions with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull on Tuesday and a luncheon with British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Halifax, on Thursday. Guo is scheduled to arrive here tonight from New York to participate in the United China Relief, where former U.S. Ambassador to France, Berle, and other dignitaries will speak. At this evening's gathering, Dr. Guo Taiqi will attend a dinner hosted by Dr. Hu Shi at the Chinese Embassy to the United States on Tuesday evening.

<p>Chongqing Newspapers Praise Sino-American Agreement</p>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, newspapers in Chongqing praised the signing of the Sino-American and Sino-British Equalization Fund Agreements, saying that the simultaneous signing of the two agreements showed the parallel nature of British and American policies of aid to China. The Sino-British Daily News stated that the statements of Morgenthau and Song Ziwen were tantamount to saying that the United States and China not only have close cooperation in the financial field but also have implemented cooperation in all aspects to protect the basic principles of freedom, which implies that in addition to economic cooperation, there is also political cooperation. As far as the agreements themselves are concerned, both were finalized more than a hundred days ago. Therefore, this equalization fund is of a hygienic nature for Chinese finance, rather than an emergency measure. In the Sino-Japanese currency war, this agreement will become the strongest fortress of Chinese finance. Moreover, due to the financial cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States, the financial institutions of Britain and the United States in China will inevitably strengthen their cooperation with the Chinese financial community in their inherent relationship. Ta Kung Pao said that the United States wants an early victory for democratic countries, so it believes that it will have a more active performance for China. As for Britain, which is fighting hard in Europe and still remembers China, this makes China especially grateful, because the depth of this meaning is not something that simple loan figures can include. (Havas News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese-language newspapers all published the news of the signing of the Sino-British and Sino-American financial loan agreements with large headlines, unanimously expressing their gratitude for the aid from Britain and the United States, and stating that Britain's heroic act in a time of difficulty and hardship is especially commendable. The financial community stated that this negotiation began in December of last year and lasted for nearly five months. This agreement is sufficient to consolidate the external value of the legal tender and to suppress prices. This agreement is closely related to the current international situation and the basic Far East policy of Britain and the United States. It fully expresses the determination of the two countries to protect the democratic countries and assist freedom. Our war of resistance is a struggle for democracy and freedom. Therefore, the basic policies of Britain, the United States, and China are obviously the same. This morning, the official Chinese newspaper published an article entitled "Further Cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States," stating that the Sino-British and Sino-American financial supply agreements can show that Britain and the United States continue to take parallel actions to aid China, and that Britain's setbacks in the Balkans cannot affect its Far East policy. At the same time, it can also express Britain's strength in assisting democratic countries to resist aggression. The newspaper also pointed out that this agreement will give the Chinese people great encouragement and further believes that it can imply that the close cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States is not limited to economic aspects. Xinhua Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, suggested withdrawing support for the Shanghai market and other occupied areas and increasing the supply of legal foreign exchange to free China, as it currently only accounts for one percent of the total. The newspaper also advocated appointing well-known public group leaders to supervise the use of loans and publishing details of payments on a regular basis to avoid financial leakage into private pockets.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reflections on the European Situation</h3>
<p>It seems that spring is a particularly favorable season for aggressive actions. Looking back at the European history of recent years, almost every year the Nazis have had a victorious performance in this season. For example, in 1938 there was the annexation of Austria, in 1939 there was the annexation of Czechoslovakia, and last year, after achieving a great victory in the Western Front war, its achievements seemed to have reached a peak. However, after nearly a year of tense stalemate, this year's Balkan War is still a military achievement for the Nazis. These days, the whole world is shocked by this new change. Amidst the complacency of the aggressors, those who love justice have further increased the burden on their hearts.</p>
<p>It is said that history is blind and that mankind is always evolving; it is said that all development is rational, but there are constant phenomena of stagnation or even reversal. In fact, these two trends are not contradictory, but the latter is only a temporary phenomenon, while the former is the overall trend. There have been constant so-called Dark Ages in history, but the conquests of Genghis Khan and the autocratic rule of the Holy Alliance were both ephemeral and had only temporary effects. Moreover, in the past, people could only be ignorant, but today, with the development of science and the advancement of human intelligence, they have gradually acquired the consciousness and confidence to create a rational history. Violence and heavy troops can break through the Maginot Line, but they may not be able to destroy the strong barriers of the common psychology of the world's people. This is an important reason why the world should not be pessimistic because of seeing all kinds of unpleasant phenomena.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent facts, there are some bright factors under the entire darkness and chaos. The resistance wars of Yugoslavia and Greece have failed one after another, but this failure is glorious; the British and French allied forces, plus the Maginot Line, were not enough to contain the Nazi offensive. How could one expect this from small countries such as Greece and Yugoslavia? But the soldiers and civilians of Greece and Yugoslavia did not lose their courage because of their barren land and small population, nor did they compromise because of the successive surrenders of some large and small countries. They only know that territorial sovereignty cannot be violated, and that they would rather die than be unfree! Yugoslavia inherently had the same weakness as Czechoslovakia, with a complex mix of nationalities. Moreover, after Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria successively joined the Axis powers, they were surrounded on all sides, which had already destined them to a tragic fate of failure. They did not take surrender for granted because of this, and they would rather suffer the pain of defeat in a battle than seek survival by surrendering without a fight. This spirit is the driving force behind the Serbian nation's ability to regain its revival after being subjected to foreign rule for thousands of years, and it is also a powerful guarantee that this country will not be wiped off the map of Europe. As for Greece, compared with pre-war Belgium, apart from its relatively large territory, its industry, military equipment, and even population, culture, politics, and national economy were far inferior. However, the duration of the German-Greek War has been longer than the German-Belgian War last spring, and the German losses have been greater. In the end, the Greek government did not follow in the footsteps of the King of Belgium and abandon its comrades to surrender, but rather continued to fight in exile overseas. This, at the very least, will make the invaders realize that the courage and will of small countries are not entirely contemptible, and that their work of building a "new order" is still full of thorns.</p>
<p>Comparing these past few years of Nazi "spring victories," the annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia were both victories without a fight, which exactly met the aggressor's highest ideals. The Western Front victory last spring was the most astonishing, but it came at a heavy price. As for this Balkan War, it was only after a long period of painstaking management that the Nazis were finally forced to engage in a showdown of strength. To use this to deal with a backward Greece and a hastily responding British army, their ultimate victory was not only unsurprising to the world but also had no astonishing record to speak of. In the ten months since the end of the Western Front War last summer, the Nazis have not established any commendable military achievements abroad, and Italy's successive defeats have greatly burdened the Axis powers. Therefore, this victory, in terms of its domestic significance, is naturally urgently needed by the Nazis, although its value to the overall war situation is still another question.</p>
<p>The German achievements in the Balkans have only the significance of a local victory, and the overall victory or defeat still depends on the future competition of the main forces. However, after the evolution of the past year, the deployment of the global anti-aggression front has been far more thorough and stronger than before. First, maritime gains and losses are the most important factor. The world's sea power is still controlled by democratic countries, not only in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, but also in the Pacific. Second, the United States' concern and assistance for the anti-aggression war has increased geometrically with the progress of the aggression front. It is expected that its future measures will not be limited to expanding the scope of Atlantic patrols and providing financial loans to China. Third, the past policy of appeasement has almost been eradicated at its roots, and that illusion has no place to exist in either Europe or the Far East. On the other hand, it also fundamentally eliminates the possibility of the aggressor winning without a fight.</p>
<h3>Chinese Consul General in the Philippines Claims Chinese Nationals Willing to Fight for the Philippines; Chairman of U.S. Aviation Committee Says Philippine Islands Should Be Protected; Planes Headed for Singapore Arrive in Manila</h3>
<p>Manila: The Chinese Consul General here, Yang Guangxing, has explained to the American representative in the Philippines and the Philippine President that in the event of an incident, 120,000 Chinese nationals in the Philippines are willing to serve the Philippines. The Japanese Consul General went to Naga, Philippines yesterday to discuss matters with Japanese nationals. That place is the center of the northern hemp industry and has a large number of Japanese nationals. Currently, Japanese merchants are closing their doors due to poor business, but they say they will still reside there. (Reuter's Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: Land, Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, declared yesterday that he guarantees that the United States will continue to work to resolve the Philippine Islands' maritime crisis. He also stated that the Maritime Commission has always paid attention to the importance of the continued trade between the United States and the Philippine Islands and is determined to maintain the openness of this sea route. Land's remarks were published in "Philippine" magazine. In his article, Land said that the shortage of ships may be resolved. One solution is to encourage the establishment of a Philippine merchant fleet, and the second is to add more ships flying the American flag to serve the Philippine Islands. Land said that in view of the aid to Britain program and the general shortage of ships, there are few ships that can be sold to the Philippine Islands for application at this time. It may not be possible to give direct assistance to the Philippine Islands Shipping Company and expand its business. However, it is somewhat better to have more ships flying the American flag serve the Philippine Islands. The 500 ships still in the original construction process can meet the needs of the country's entire overseas trade. With this plan, American shipping companies operating in the Philippine Islands will have access to fast, economical, and modern ships. Combining these ships with the other ships in the past ten months, the tonnage of American ships in the Pacific can be increased by 125%. Although the current international situation is quite dim, the process of increasing the tonnage of Philippine Islands trading ships in the future is somewhat obstructed and difficult to implement. However, the Maritime Commission will definitely pay close attention to the importance of American commercial and Philippine Islands trade interests in deciding how to dispose of new ships. In the same magazine, Congressman Magnuson, a Democrat from Washington State, wrote an article strongly stating that as long as the Philippine Islands are under the American flag, the United States has a responsibility to defend the Philippine Islands against foreign enemies, and it is also the duty of the United States to cultivate the Philippine Islands' ability to defend itself in preparation for future independence. Magnuson also said that it is very important to train Philippine sailors to gain experience in operating small fleets, even if they only gain coastal patrol experience, it will be enough to increase the morale of the island's people, and this successful small fleet of training is enough to form the core of the Philippine Islands Navy. This navy, although small in strength, will be of inestimable help to the U.S. Navy patrolling this large area of the ocean. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Manila: The third huge "Consolidated B-24 Liberator" bomber, which was being shipped to Singapore for use by the British Air Force, arrived at Pan American Airways Airport in Cavite last night. This giant plane was piloted by Mr. Webbe, who came here attached to the plane. Mr. Webbe refused to comment and said that he was under strict orders from the Canadian Pacific Railway Air Lines authorities to remain silent and not comment. The pilot who came with him was Mr. Kasidon, who used to work for the China National Aviation Corporation. It is expected that this [plane] will be handed over to a British airman to fly to Singapore or Hong Kong. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Philippine Island Promotion of Defense Program</h3>
<p>Manila - Recent meetings in Manila between British and American representatives to discuss the defense of the Far East by American, Filipino, and British troops have greatly excited the authorities guarding the Philippine Islands. Consequently, they are now rapidly promoting the program for a complete Philippine civil defense force to prepare for all emergencies. Although the issue of the Philippine civil defense force was significantly mentioned in the meetings with various high-ranking officials, the active preparations on the part of the British and Americans have made the Philippine authorities feel that they have ample time for preparation. Recent reports from Washington state that the U.S. will use sugar taxes and gold devaluation, or loans from the Export-Import Bank, to subsidize the Philippine civil defense force, which is welcomed here. In the past few years, the development of the Philippine civil defense force has often been hampered by a lack of funding. Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and General Grande, commander of the Philippine Islands, along with senior U.S. officials stationed in the Philippines, have repeatedly held meetings in late March and early April to discuss the Philippine civil defense program. At the same time, the National Emergency Affairs Committee, chaired by Defense Minister Sison and under the guidance of President Quezon, has also begun planning the civil defense program, the outline of which is as follows (any part or the entirety of the program must be carried out with the assistance of U.S. defense officials): (1) Determine locations for evacuating women, children, and non-essential personnel from cities such as Manila; (2) Government and private businesses should establish shelters for the residence of government personnel and those involved in government work; (3) Maintain and protect important public utilities; (4) Store gasoline, kerosene, and other military oils; (5) Maintain a supply of food and clean water, including canned meat, wheat, and daily necessities; (6) Maintain all transportation lines, ensuring the safety of electricity; (7) Preserve important sera and vaccines and purchase necessary surgical instruments; (8) People in various regions should organize volunteer defense groups. Defense Minister Sison stated that volunteer defense groups are particularly helpful in air raids. These defense groups are formed entirely by the voluntary participation of the people and do not include the Philippine police force. Sison also pointed out that air raid shelters are particularly unsuitable in Manila, and the construction of basements is even more impossible because the foundation of the Philippine Islands is very humid and lacks building materials such as steel and cement. Therefore, the best preventive measure is to evacuate to other areas without military targets. Manila will also implement this immediately upon the successful organization of the defense groups. According to the civil defense budget passed by the authorities last year, there is US$1.5 million, but the Philippine authorities still hope that the United States can provide more financial assistance. The civil defense program was actually planned last year, but it was terminated due to a dispute between senior U.S. officials stationed in Manila and the government regarding the responsibility for civil defense. It was not until Washington explicitly expressed support for the Philippine civil defense that it began to proceed. Generally, independent observers believe that although Philippine officials are now engaged in guiding the program, the cooperation of U.S. officials is driven by Washington. President Quezon's lack of energy has also prevented other officials from actively implementing this plan. (United Press, 27th)</p>

<p>Japanese Newspaper Severely Criticizes Vietnam</p>
<p>Today's Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun commented, advising the French-controlled Vietnamese authorities to change their attitude and sincerely cooperate with Japan. The newspaper said, "The French Vietnamese authorities are adopting anti-Japanese measures, causing us to doubt their good intentions." The newspaper cited the restrictions imposed on Japanese merchants, who are not allowed to join the Vietnam Importers Association, and said, "This attitude is surprising. French Vietnam has the right to organize such an association, using legality to conceal the obstruction of Japan's peaceful economic progress. But we doubt that there are other reasons and motives behind such actions. The anti-Japanese attitude in Vietnam, near Saigon, is very obvious. Japanese stores have been damaged, and Japanese people have been attacked. French Vietnam has no reason to reject Japan's peaceful proposals. The French anti-Japanese attitude is because Japan has always been generous, leading them to mistakenly believe that Japan is to be pitied." (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - Foreign news agencies issued a message stating that the French Minister to Thailand, Garreau, has traveled from Hanoi to Bangkok to restore diplomatic relations between France and Thailand.

Garreau came here only to have contact with the Vietnamese authorities. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3>Japan to Imitate Germany in Controlling National Life</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Matsuoka said in a welcome speech yesterday that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact has not eliminated the country's current difficulties. If possible, from tomorrow onwards, he would like to imitate Germany's method and establish a system to control the lives of the Japanese people. Unfortunately, this system is still just empty talk on paper. Although Germany certainly had a stage of paper planning first, Japan today really does not have this leisurely time. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Axis Newspapers Attack the United States</h3>
<p>Berlin - German newspapers yesterday strongly attacked President Roosevelt's declaration that the U.S. neutrality patrol would be extended worldwide if necessary, and warned that this move by the U.S. would be tantamount to seeking trouble. They also stated that Germany, Italy, and Japan had all decided to resist Roosevelt's pro-British policy and that the war had not advanced toward the U.S., but Roosevelt was now entering the path of war. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German government dismissed as a joke President Roosevelt's statement that "the Axis powers have occupied part of Greenland, which may happen." (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome - The "Rome Daily" wrote an editorial yesterday stating that the U.S. government is thinking of drawing the U.S. into the war. The newspaper commented on the recent speeches by U.S. Secretary of State Hull and U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, stating that after the British army's defeat in the Balkans, the U.S. government has openly adopted a belligerent attitude towards the Axis powers. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The Hamburger Fremdenblatt commented on the U.S. fleet escorting convoys, saying that the appearance of the U.S. flag in the European theater directly harms Germany's interests. Hitler said in his speech on January 30, "Those who unwisely want to help Britain must know this fact: regardless of whether ships have naval escorts, all those within the range of German torpedoes will be sunk by torpedoes." The article stated that the claims of U.S. interventionists only harm the future of the U.S. and do not benefit German-American relations. Germany's goal is to deal with its only enemy, Britain. Germany's policy toward the Western Hemisphere is only to promote legitimate economic interests, and it does not ask about anything else. There is no need for conflict between the German and American nations. Hitler's warning is still in effect, and the entire German nation fully supports it with all its strength. The U.S. interventionists, who are driving U.S. ships into the war zone and inciting the American people's war frenzy, must bear full responsibility for all the consequences.

In the past hundred years, no small country has suffered more from Germany's expansionist desires than Hungary.

We Hungarians residing in the Dutch East Indies have opposed Nazism since before the outbreak of the European war. We are willing to share common responsibilities in the Dutch East Indies with the qualifications of loyal citizens. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Greek War Nearing End; German Troops Entered Athens Yesterday; Greek Commander-in-Chief Resigns; Most British Troops Withdraw to North Africa to Fight</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced this afternoon that the vanguard of the German army entered Athens at 9:25 this morning. The 卐 flag has been hoisted over the city. It also stated that German paratroopers occupied the Corinth isthmus, Corinth town, and the Corinth Canal yesterday. It also stated that the Führer's bodyguard is advancing rapidly west of the Pindus Mountains, reaching the Bay of Patras, and has crossed the bay and entered the Peloponnese. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>London - The final stage of the Greek war is nearing its end. A team of German motorized bicycle soldiers entered Athens at 9:30 on Sunday morning. At the same time, the 卐 flag was seen flying over the Acropolis. It is heard that the main force of the German army arrived two hours later. The Greek people witnessed the German troops marching in formation, with a rather calm attitude. According to a telegram from Hitler's headquarters received by the German official news agency, the Hitler bodyguard advancing in the Peloponnese, starting west of the Pindus Mountains, has forced its way across the Bay of Patras. German paratroopers are said to have captured the Corinth isthmus, and the city and canal have been occupied. According to a telegram from Athens, General Papagos, the Greek commander-in-chief, has requested to be placed on the retired list. Prime Minister Tsouderos has concurrently assumed the position of Minister of the Army. External personnel Agropoulos has been appointed as the commander of all the Aegean islands. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Zurich - This station received a broadcast from a German radio station yesterday afternoon, which said, "German troops have occupied the islands of Lemnos, Skyros, and Thasos, etc., and are quite close to the Dardanelles Strait, so the British have completely lost their territorial waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea." (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Athens - Residents of Athens, at 0:10 this morning, quietly awaited the arrival of German troops inside their tightly closed doors and under shattered windows. The evening newspaper urged the people to greet the German troops with a grim smile. Due to the curfew, the people on the streets had disappeared in the evening. The weather was mild last night, and a royal edict was issued in the evening, stating that General Papagos, the commander-in-chief, had requested to resign and was immediately relieved of his duties. The Athens radio station stated that the Ministry of Public Security announced that the damage from German aircraft bombing various places in Attica and the Peloponnese was minor, and there were not many deaths. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>London - This station said at 6:00 p.m. yesterday (1:00 a.m. this morning in Shanghai) that although the number and firepower of the British rearguard were far inferior to the German army, they were still strongly defending to cover the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force from Greece. The German army used air force and 155mm heavy artillery to fiercely bomb and pave the way for the advancing Nazi tank army. The small number of British troops defending Thermopylae was similar to the army of Leonidas in 480 BC, which used a small number to resist the Persian army. When the German vanguard entered the vast countryside, its numbers were far superior to the British army. The German army's offensive route targeted Marathon, Athens, and the Corinth isthmus. This was the only route of escape for the British Expeditionary Force on land. Observers here admitted that the British army could not have a great victory on the Marathon plain like in ancient times, because the German strategy undoubtedly intended to cut off the route of the isthmus as soon as possible, cutting off all land routes. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Athens - The retreating British army fought against the German armored column at Kitheron, between Athens and Thebes (north of Athens) yesterday afternoon. There was also a stubborn rearguard battle at Mount Lamia, which controls the only car road passing through the narrow waist of Corinth and serves as a barrier to the Corinth Canal. The Athens area was bombed by airplanes all day long. The Athens Nea newspaper stated that the British rearguard resisted very stubbornly. The German army, which descended from Thermopylae, suffered extremely heavy losses. The Ethnos newspaper also stated that several locations on the large mountain controlling the Gulf of Corinth are in the hands of the Allied forces, and a major battle will occur in the area of Kyriaki. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>London - Last night, Athens radio said that the German troops who had broken through the Thermopylae line were still advancing southeast. The British army in Greece is now only conducting operations to block the enemy's advance, but it can only provide temporary support. Therefore, the purpose of this type of warfare is only to delay time. The British rearguard is now engaged in resistance at various strategic locations, because it will not be without difficulty for the enemy to advance deep into the southeast. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Greek Cabinet Coordinator Sakellaropoulos issued a letter to the Greek youth on the island of Crete yesterday, stating that the Greek government's withdrawal from the mainland is temporary.

<p>New York - The New York Times reported that most of the British troops and equipment had safely withdrawn from Greece and were headed to North Africa to fight. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Surrender of the Greek Army in Epirus: Actually Due to the Disparity in Numbers, Not Due to a Lack of Courage</h3>
<p>London - Athens Radio last night broadcast an article from the Greek Ministry of the Army, stating that the surrender of the Greek army in the Epirus region was not due to a lack of courage, but because the Greek army had to confront the armies of two major countries with a combined population of 150 million. Due to the disparity in numbers and the vast difference in advantages and disadvantages, the Greek army fought hard on the Albanian front for six months and won victories repeatedly. Unexpectedly, the southern army retreated, leaving the rear empty, and the enemy then attacked from behind with a numerically stronger army and its mechanized weapons. In this environment, the Greek army had no choice but to retreat 90 miles under continuous air raids, without any protection from anti-aircraft guns. However, during this retreat, not a single person was lost, and the mobilization was well-managed, which will be admired when the details are announced in the future. The transportation lines of the Greek army in Epirus were bombed and cut off, and it could not contact the headquarters or obtain supplies. Moreover, it was attacked by enemy forces from the east and north. It was absolutely impossible to continue fighting. Only then did it surrender. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Army Continues to Enter the Macedonia Region; Italian Army Also Occupies Greek Territory and Establishes New Administrative Agencies</h3>

<h3>Turkish Newspaper Publishes Article Advocating Soviet-Turkish Cooperation; German Defense Council Orders the Excavation of a Canal to Control Water Transport from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea</h3>
<p>Ankara - A Turkish newspaper published an article yesterday predicting that Germany will make demands on Turkey. It advocates Soviet-Turkish cooperation, saying that Hitler will or will try to find military bases in French and Spanish Africa in order to drive away the British fleet. Although the idea that Germany is putting pressure on Turkey and the Soviet Union is purely conjecture, it is by no means delusional. No one knows what kind of demands the Germans will make on Turkey and the Soviet Union, but many believe that the Germans will have something to say about the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. This statement by a Turkish newspaper is the first since the outbreak of the European war. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London - According to the German official news agency, German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, arrived in Berlin on Friday and will stay for a day or two. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

According to the agreement, Germany will exchange agricultural products, including tobacco, for Turkish medical supplies. Hungary and Turkey have also launched a trade agreement worth 20 million Turkish pounds, which will be signed in the Hungarian capital within ten days. This is the result of four months of negotiations. Turkey will exchange agricultural products for Hungarian industrial products. The Turkish-Bulgarian trade agreement is even more ideal, with the exchange value reaching 40 million Turkish pounds. This number is the largest among the agreements Turkey has ever signed with Balkan countries, and it is twice as large as the current Turkish-German barter agreement. Turkey will export steel, iron seedlings, cotton, fruits, vegetables, etc. to Bulgaria, and Bulgaria will exchange manufactured goods, such as radio parts. All items will be transported via the Danube River. (United Press, 27th)</p>

<h3>Regardless of West or Far East, Allied Nations Will Eventually Win; Britain Has Created Moral Capital, Will Defeat Hitler with Sea Power; Broadcast Address by South African Prime Minister General Smuts</h3>
<p>Cape Town: South African Prime Minister General Smuts gave a broadcast here last night, stating that compared to the fundamental points, the Balkan war is merely a branch of the European war. Although Germany currently has the upper hand, it will ultimately fail. If Britain does not fall and sea power is not lost, then Hitler will ultimately be defeated. Although Hitler has won victories everywhere in Europe, he has not been able to cope with the real key points.</p>
<p>The Balkans Is Not the Decisive Battle</p>
<p>There is one more thing that allows us to look forward to the future with confidence: Hitler's revealed true face and his new order have awakened the United States from its slumber and aroused it to action. He believes that final victory will belong to the Allied nations, not only in the Balkans but also in the West and the Far East. Yugoslavia collapsed shortly after the start of the war. Greece, after a brave defense, was unable to contain a more numerous and powerful enemy, and the British army retreated slightly after being pressed by a formidable foe. People inevitably have doubts about the future of the Allied nations. It should be known that during the last European war, the position of the Allied nations in Europe was even worse than today, but the Allied nations ultimately won. The current war cannot be decided in the Balkans. Britain's willingness to make sacrifices to assist Greece and other small countries is a matter of Britain's honor. Germany inspires hatred, while Britain inspires friendship. Therefore, Britain is now creating a kind of moral capital, and only this can establish a truly new world order after peace is restored. Hitler launched the war, and as an aggressor, he will inevitably continue his aggression until he is exhausted.</p>
<p>Germany Will Eventually Attempt to Invade Britain</p>
<p>Britain is fundamentally on the defensive. If Hitler cannot invade Britain, then he will not achieve his goal and will inevitably fail. Therefore, sooner or later, Hitler will be forced to attempt an invasion of Britain. This is the fundamental point, and everything else is merely a branch. Victory in the Balkans or elsewhere cannot provide Hitler with the ultimate benefit. Even if Hitler destroys all the countries of continental Europe, he will ultimately fail if he cannot defeat Britain. As for Britain's defenses, in order to maintain food and other supplies, the lifeline of transportation must be kept open. This is the route of the North Atlantic and the Cape of Good Hope. As for transportation in the Mediterranean, it is also important, but secondary. These are all Britain's lifelines. Britain may temporarily lose everything else, but if it can defeat the enemy's invasion and keep this lifeline open, it has already defeated Hitler and can restore what was temporarily lost.</p>
<p>Victory Can Be Ensured If the US Joins the War</p>
<p>The results we have achieved in Africa and the Mediterranean are already very important, and the United States has also provided us with assistance through the Lend-Lease Act. However, it is not only this. The relationship between the United States and the Allied nations is becoming closer, and there will soon be major developments. This is what he has long predicted. In his view, only active participation by the United States can ensure victory at an early date. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>London: British Naval Minister's Private Secretary Fletcher gave a speech yesterday in Uxbridge, Buckinghamshire, saying that British sea power will eventually defeat Hitler. The Germans do not know the importance of sea power, and even Hitler himself does not fully understand the meaning of sea power. Since the time of Queen Elizabeth, Britain has repeatedly won major victories, all with sea power as the ultimate tool for victory. This will continue to be the case in the future. The sea power that Britain will ultimately use to defeat Hitler is this sea power. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>60,000 German Troops Concentrated on French-Spanish Border, Preparing to Invade Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Budapest: Four divisions of German mechanized troops, totaling 60,000 men, are currently concentrated on the French-Spanish border, preparing to invade Gibraltar. At the same time, they plan to occupy Suez to defeat the British Eastern Mediterranean Fleet. Well-informed sources here predict that the German army will take advantage of its sweeping victories in southern Greece to invade the Mediterranean. It is rumored that the Axis powers plan to use troops from Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to defend southern Greece, so that Axis troops can invade Egypt and approach the Iraqi oil fields through Syria. German motorized reinforcements have been steadily entering Greece since yesterday, after four days of silence. According to reports here, thousands of German and Italian aircraft are now striving to eliminate the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force and are attacking the British fleet with all their strength.

<p>Gibraltar: It was learned yesterday that a large-scale blackout exercise will be held here this week. (United Press dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Axis Focus on Egypt</p>
<p>Observers in Rome recently stated that the Balkan war is only the initial stage of the battle for control of the Mediterranean. This struggle has no possibility of stopping at this time, but it will soon reach a turning point. Although the press and political figures here will remain silent about Turkey's future movements, they will speak freely about the African war, emphasizing that according to the Axis powers' view, Africa is actually the tail end of the European continent. Therefore, after the end of the Balkan war, the Axis powers' focus will be on Egypt, because Egypt is the gateway between the East and the West, and the hub of Africa and Asia. Furthermore, as is generally known here, once the Axis powers have won victory in the Mediterranean, an international conference will be held in Berlin or Vienna to discuss the African issue. All European countries, including non-belligerent countries such as Spain, former belligerent countries such as France, and neutral countries such as Switzerland and Sweden, will be able to send representatives to participate. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3>Portuguese Prime Minister Reiterates Neutral Intent, Will Continue to Send Troops to the Azores</h3>
<p>New York: Private sources say that Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar reiterated Portugal's complete neutrality last Monday, because the people of the country are extremely apprehensive due to the rumors spread by the two belligerent countries and need assurance. The Portuguese government has sent troops to the Azores (in the Atlantic Ocean) to protect its sovereignty, and has recently sent additional artillery units. It plans to send another 10,000 men, mostly infantry and artillery, and officers and doctors have been ordered to serve on the island for four years. (United Press dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>Swedish Newspaper Comments on the Situation, Italian Combat Power Is Weak, Greece Is Glorious Even in Defeat</h3>
<p>Sweden: A newspaper here reported that Italy alone could not conquer weak Greece. When Germany launched its attack, the final outcome was already decided. However, even in the final stage, Greece's reputation will remain glorious. A naval correspondent for a certain newspaper discussed the situation in North Africa, saying that if the British Navy blocks German-Italian maritime traffic in the Mediterranean, it will not only provide active assistance to the defense of Egypt, but will also eventually isolate the French, Italian, and German land forces, forcing them to retreat and unable to attack the Suez Canal.

<h3>German Correspondent Reports on Statistics of Sinking British Ships</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to Lieutenant General Pfeiffer, a naval correspondent for Haitong News Agency, as the British army withdrew from Greece to Crete and Egypt, German and Italian aircraft bombed transport ships, sinking 34 ships, totaling 180,000 tons, including three oil tankers and many ships full of troops. They also destroyed one patrol boat and one small warship. In total, the ships destroyed included one British cruiser, one battleship, three destroyers, one warship, one submarine, two auxiliary cruisers, and 67 merchant ships, totaling 190,000 tons. German submarines, near Britain, attacked convoys and sank three enemy ships, totaling 14,000 tons, and sank the 16,000-ton auxiliary cruiser "Rajputana" and two merchant ships in the Atlantic. German submarines have changed their area of operations, so fewer ships have been sunk. German submarine aces Kretschmer and Schepke's submarines have been lost, which is deeply regrettable. They received the highest honor for German soldiers, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. Kretschmer and part of his crew have been rescued. Schepke went down with his submarine. Kretschmer had sunk three British destroyers, three auxiliary cruisers, and other ships, totaling 316,000 tons. Schepke sank 233,970 tons. Italian submarines sank one British destroyer, and Italian torpedo boats sank one 15,000-ton oil tanker and one 8,000-ton auxiliary cruiser. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>America's Financial Problems and Measures</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jin</p>
<p>This article was originally written by Mr. Zhou Jin, Secretary of the Business School of Shanghai University, at the request of the China National Economic Research Institute, for the foreign section of the third continued edition of the "China and Foreign Economic Yearbook" of the institute. The full text is divided into sections such as finance, industry, and trade, and it offers many unique insights into the current economic trends in the United States. Its detailed description is an added bonus. At the beginning of the Sino-American monetary cooperation, the current state of American finance will surely be welcomed by readers. With the consent of the author and the institute, we are publishing the finance section first, so that readers can have a quick look. Special note to thank the author and the institute. — Editor</p>
<p>In the American financial world of 1940, there are several points to note! First, the national banking industry is showing signs of improvement; second, there is a panic of inflation following the outbreak of war; third, the surplus of gold has become a more serious problem; and fourth, measures to freeze foreign assets have been taken to prevent Germany from seizing funds from occupied countries. These four items will now be described separately.</p>
<p>(1) The Calm Scene of the Banking Industry In general, the American banking industry still showed signs of improvement last year; but if analyzed carefully, there are inevitably various difficulties and pains. First, the number of banks is less than in previous years, but this is due to the large number of bank closures at the end of the previous year, and not because the banking industry was sluggish last year. On the contrary, the number of bank closures last year was less than in any previous year, which also suggests that the banking industry did not have any major difficulties. The following is a table of the number of operating banks and closed banks in the past three years:</p>
<p>(A) Statistics of Operating Banks</p>
<p>(B) Statistics of Closed Banks</p>
<p>(Note) The number of banks listed in the table are those that have temporarily or permanently closed due to financial difficulties. If all debts have been recognized by other banks at the time of closure, they are not included. As for the amount of deposits, for member banks and insured non-member banks, the data is based on the day of closure, and for uninsured non-member banks, the data is based on the latest information available when the closure report is received.</p>
<p>Looking at the reserves of the banks, the actual amount generally exceeds the required amount by a large margin (see the table below). This is naturally a sign of consolidation for the banks themselves, but it inevitably raises concerns about credit expansion for the society, because ordinary commercial banks can lend three dollars and fifty cents for every dollar of reserves. Since reserves are excessive, there is naturally the possibility of credit expansion.</p>
<p>Reserves of Member Banks in Federal Reserve Banks in December 1940</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of business, the amount of deposits, loans and investments of each bank has increased, but the rate of increase in deposits is greater than the rate of increase in loans and other investments, resulting in excess reserves becoming a more serious problem. All banks are troubled by the increase in deposits and the lack of ways to use them, resulting in bank interest rates falling to the lowest point in history.</p>
<p>Table of Deposits, Loans and Investments of All Banks</p>
<p>(2) The Problem of Inflation Because of the sharp increase in national defense spending and the increasing deficit in the national treasury, and because of the sharp rise in prices following the outbreak of World War II, Americans are worried about the crisis of inflation. However, according to experts, this crisis is not difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>First, let's examine the national treasury deficit. According to the views of a group of American financiers, the government's method of increasing the money supply, either by issuing banknotes or by selling government bonds to the Federal Reserve Banks or commercial banks, may seem alarming at first glance, but in reality it is often limited by the amount by which government expenditures exceed revenues. Moreover, referring to past examples, the increase in the total amount of currency is often smaller than the amount of the government deficit. The way to make up for it is not necessarily to issue banknotes or sell government bonds to banks, but to sell government bonds to the public, which can avoid the impact of inflation. The current currency in the United States is 65 billion yuan. If the government deficit is only within 5 billion yuan, it will definitely not lead to inflation. It will not be until it reaches more than 10 billion yuan that there will be such fears. According to the US government budget for the past three years, the deficit has increased from 3.6 billion yuan in 1939-40 to 6.2 billion yuan in 1940-41 and 9.2 billion yuan in 1941-42. If it continues to increase in the future, the problem of inflation may also increase in its seriousness.</p>
<p>Next, let's examine the rise in prices. When the European war broke out in the fall of 1939, the prices of various major commodities suddenly soared. This was entirely the result of speculation, so it was very temporary and prices fell again. However, in the last two months of last year, there was a slight upward trend again. However, because of the cooperation between the government and the people, the United States can increase the supply of goods and prevent prices from rising too much. At present, the US Department of the Treasury has a large number of products, including unguaranteed loans released by the Commodity Credit Corporation, including 9.5 million bales of cotton, 500 million bushels of grain, 100 million bushels of wheat, and many other items; it also has a large amount of oils and fats from the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation. In the future, if inflation occurs, these goods can be used to lower prices. Moreover, for the sake of establishing Pan-American economic defense, the United States is trying its best to purchase special products from South American countries, such as oil, wheat, coffee, cotton, etc. These things have no market in the United States. Now that they are stored, they can also be used to curb inflation in the future. In addition, the US government's power to control prices was effectively used during the last war, and there is a strong tendency to reuse it this time. Therefore, the problem of inflation may be resolved peacefully through the above-mentioned measures.</p>
<p>(3) The Problem of Gold Surplus In the past five or six years, gold has continuously flowed into the United States from all over the world, making the United States hold more than 70% of the world's existing gold, which has caused various concerns about the gold surplus. This can be said to be a strange phenomenon in the economic world. There are many reasons for the gold surplus in the United States. Generally speaking, the devaluation of the pound in 1931 and the devaluation of the dollar in 1934 were enough to encourage gold production. The outbreak of wars in Europe and Asia has made Japan and European countries want to exchange their gold for military supplies or seek safe storage, and they have deeply transferred it to the United States. In addition, the recovery of US overseas investments and the payment of international trade surpluses also make gold flow into the United States. The following table shows the changes in US gold reserves.</p>
<p>Table of US Gold Reserves and Gold Import Values in the Past Seven Years</p>
<p>(Note 1) Calculated at a gold price of 20.67 yuan per ounce in January 1934, and 35 yuan per ounce thereafter.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Includes gold in bad debts, valued at 27,000,000 yuan at the end of 1936 and 1,228,000,000 yuan at the end of 1937.</p>
<p>Estimated number</p>
<p>From the above table, we can see that gold flowed into the United States the most in the last two times. According to the report of the US Federal Reserve Board, after the outbreak of the European War, the value of gold flowing into the United States was greater than any previous period. From the end of August 1939 to the end of 1940, its imports were 5.8 billion yuan. Of this, approximately 700 million yuan is still designated by the Federal Reserve Bank as belonging to the governments or central banks of exporting countries, and the remainder has increased to the US gold reserves. Therefore, the value of gold reserves, including domestic gold production, increased by 5.3 billion yuan during the war, reaching 22 billion yuan by the end of 1940.</p>
<p>The main concerns caused by excessive gold are two: first, it is feared that excessive reserves will cause credit expansion, causing changes in prices and living expenses; second, it is feared that Germany will win the war and permanently abolish gold as a monetary standard, causing gold to lose its value. Regarding these two points, the former already has this trend. Fortunately, the United States has abundant domestic industrial raw materials and food, and the government and the people know the importance of maintaining market responsibilities, which may avoid adverse consequences. As for the latter, it is generally believed that gold is the best monetary material and will never be permanently abandoned, and after the war, European countries will inevitably withdraw their funds to seek recovery, so gold will be able to regain its importance. However, different people have different opinions, and each has its own reasons.</p>
<p>There are many suggestions for solving the "gold disaster", such as stopping the purchase of all gold, lowering gold prices or taxing to limit the inflow of gold, signing international agreements to reduce gold production, abolishing private restrictions on gold, restoring gold coin circulation, increasing the legal reserve ratio of bank deposits, exporting gold to foreign goods, etc., but there is no fixed countermeasure. How it will change in the future, we can only wait and see.</p>
<p>(4) Implementation of Freezing Foreign Assets After Germany and Poland started the war in September 1939, many small and weak European countries were partially or completely occupied by Germany. In order to curb the Axis powers and protect democratic countries, President Roosevelt, based on the provisions of the US War Act promulgated on October 6, 1917, that the president has the power to order the prohibition of domestic funds from flowing abroad, starting in April last year, successively froze the funds of several countries occupied by Germany in the United States, to prevent them from being seized by Germany. The start dates of the freezing of each country and the amount of frozen funds are listed below: (Unit: million US dollars)</p>
<p>Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were occupied by Soviet Russia in May 1940.</p>
<p>In addition to those listed in the table above, it is rumored that the United States has also approved the freezing of the funds of the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the United States. According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on February 4 this year, it is estimated that German deposits in the United States are US$113,000,000, and Italian deposits in the United States are US$82,000,000, totaling nearly US$200 million. Recently, it has also been rumored that after Congress passes the Aid to Democratic Countries Act, Roosevelt will continue to freeze the funds of the United Kingdom, Greece, China, and Central and South American countries in the United States. However, the US freezing of the funds of Norway, Belgium, etc. is all to prevent the funds of the above-mentioned countries from being seized by Germany and Italy, or from using methods to obtain US or third-country materials to maintain their war of aggression, so the freezing is very strict; as for wanting to freeze the funds of democratic countries, although it is also to prevent the crisis of being used by the Axis powers, after the freezing, if the democratic countries need to use them, they can still apply to the US Department of the Treasury for withdrawal permits after reviewing the source and use of the funds, so the two are very different.</p>

<p>Prosperity inside barbed wire relies on two kinds of fertilizer: one is the skeletons of those who died heroically on the battlefield; the other is the skeletons of those who starved to death on the road.</p>
<p>However: Prosperity inside barbed wire also has two major contributions: one is to create a large number of new troops for the Communist Party; the other is to create another group of new comrades for the anti-Communist faction.</p>

<h3>China's Economic Strategy</h3>
<p>— Li Zongming</p>
<p>"Continuing the Economic Construction of Free China"</p>
<p>According to Dr. Gong Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs of China, the Chinese government's economic blockade against Japan has been remarkably effective due to the implementation of the following three measures:</p>
<p>(1) In order to defeat the Japanese policy of "using war to support war", the Chinese government first promulgated the Regulations on the Prohibition of the Transportation of Local Products in August 1939, prohibiting the transportation of materials into the occupied areas. These materials include two categories: one is raw materials for manufacturing munitions, such as cotton, coal, salt, and metal ores; the other is goods that the Japanese can export to exchange for foreign exchange, such as leather, wool, pig bristles, and soybeans. After that, the government also issued a general order to the political, military, and customs authorities at all levels to prohibit the smuggling of more than 60 kinds of materials into the occupied areas, and set up water offices to be responsible for investigation. In addition, in order to actively prevent all resources from being used by the Japanese, on the one hand, the government ordered the International Trade Commission and the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau to purchase materials from various places as much as possible for export, military, or daily use by the people; on the other hand, the government advised the people in the occupied areas to change their production businesses or reduce production, only seeking to meet their consumption needs. In 1938, the goods transported from the occupied areas to Japan were worth 116,000,000 yuan, which had been reduced to 66,000,000 yuan by 1939. How effective it is! It goes without saying!</p>
<p>(2) In order to eradicate smuggling, the government promulgated laws to resist the entry of various goods manufactured by Japan and its colonies: this law also applies to factories opened by the Japanese in the occupied areas and Chinese factories under Japanese control. This measure makes it impossible for the Japanese to obtain Chinese legal tender and other materials at will. However, our government authorities do not neglect the issue of supplying the general necessities of the people in the country, and therefore vigorously encourage and promote various small crafts and small industries. Moreover, the above-mentioned boycott of Japanese goods is not limited to the country; it is also strictly implemented among the 100 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world; other peace-loving countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, India, and Australia, are also inspired by justice and launched a movement to boycott Japanese goods, which is even more exciting.</p>
<p>(3) Launching a wide range of guerrilla warfare to engage in economic sabotage in the occupied areas, the Japanese imported 310,000,000 yuan of goods into the occupied areas in 1939, which is quite alarming compared to 150,000,000 yuan in 1937 and 200,000,000 yuan in 1938! However, the increase in Japanese exports to the occupied areas cannot be immediately regarded as a blessing for the Japanese. Under the current circumstances, after Japanese goods are imported into the occupied areas, the income is military tickets and foreign exchange, but the raw materials used to manufacture the goods themselves must be purchased from abroad with foreign exchange. Therefore, the increase in Japanese exports to the occupied areas today is tantamount to investing foreign exchange in China. Unless the order in the occupied areas is restored and Chinese raw materials are supplied to meet the needs of Japan, so that its industrial exports can rotate continuously, there will be little chance of benefit to it in the end.</p>
<h3>A Few Words on Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>Let me first explain three terms: (1) Syndicalism, hoping to produce an ideal organization of an economic alliance, and to reconcile the industrial councils organized by various industries, so that this organization can achieve stability. (2) Guild Socialism, which hopes that the national industry will have a centralized organization, so that the position of production and the position of consumption can be on a unified position. (3) The World Workers' Association is to form a control over the activities of each sector of the world industry, and then unite each sector. This united organization is used to replace each sector. As for the goals of these three, they are: (1) to put the social economic organization on a new ideal and to oppose the old organization. (2) In contrast to the above-mentioned idea is conservatism. Conservatism does not want to overthrow this system, because conservatism has a close relationship with democracy. Under conservatism, economic interests are controlled by Congress, until economic shortcomings occur, so social reformers use regional election councils to participate in professional elections. In Germany, there was Bismarck's proposal that Congress should participate in this kind of council. He hoped that the social insurance law could be passed in Congress. Through his efforts, a professional election representative was formed later. The same result occurred in Italy, from which it can be seen that Bismarck was also a conservative. (3) The so-called other ways represent the organization of the country, but this kind of thinking is created by the thinkers of the anti-government parties in various countries. They often attack the shortcomings of the parliamentary system, criticize the incompetence of democracy, and believe that it should be controlled by professional groups. In actual life, the above three ideas can be said to have created the source of the idea of controlled economy.</p>
<p>The emergence of controlled economy is different in each country, so the organization and the power of the organization are naturally different. Looking at the similarities in the organization of each country, the organization adopts a committee system. The members are citizens of the country, and most of them belong to the leaders of professional groups. There are 48 people in the Economic Council in France, 326 people in Germany, and other countries are unequal. The term of office is from two to six years. Their production can be divided into four types: (1) freely elected by professional groups to form, (2) nominated by professional groups and then appointed by the government, (3) composed of relevant professional representatives or experts appointed by the government, (4) composed of relevant administrative personnel appointed by the government. The nature of its organization can be divided into three types: (1) planning and execution agency, the Soviet Union does not have the power to plan, but has the power to control the national industry. (2) Representative advisory body, which is composed of the whole country and can help the government to promote the policy of controlled economy. (3) Appointed advisory body, composed of experts selected by the government.</p>

<h3>The Four Banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture Will Resume Business This Morning. The Police Authorities Will Provide Solid Protection, and the Financial Situation of Shanghai Will Become More Stable.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branches and sub-branches of the Central, China, Communications, and China Minsheng Banks and the retreating banks in the war zone have temporarily suspended business since April 17. After the head office telegraphed to resume business immediately to maintain the financial situation, each bank prepared to resume business and discussed protection measures with the concession authorities. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from the four banks yesterday that the arrangements for defense and preparations have been completed, and they are preparing to announce the resumption of business today (Monday). All bills and notes during the suspension period will be collected and cleared on the day of resumption of business. At the same time, the bank bill exchange will resume the exchange of bills from the four banks on the same day. The employees of the four banks, in view of the importance of their responsibilities, have all agreed to continue to serve the society. The concession authorities have sent Chinese and Western detectives and business groups to be stationed in each bank and office to provide solid protection and open for business.</p>
<p>The end of April can be safely passed.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai branches of the four banks decided to resume business today, the entire financial situation in Shanghai has become more stable, the speculative market has been completely silent, and people's hearts are at peace. The rumors that the four banks had withdrawn and the employees had resigned have been proven by facts to be completely untrue. Due to the resumption of business by the four banks and the stabilization of the financial situation, all industries will be able to safely pass the end of April. Recently, as the end of April approaches, each industry has separately contacted each bank and village to negotiate for an extension or return of the funds due at the end of April, and to negotiate for new long-term credit funds. It is said that these long-term credit funds will be finalized on April 30.</p>
<p>The Equalization Fund is Becoming More Abundant</p>
<p>Since the signing and establishment of the Sino-American and Sino-British Equalization Fund loans, a total of US$50 million from the United States and £5 million from the United Kingdom have been transferred to the Equalization Foreign Exchange Fund Committee for equalization purposes. In addition, the China National Bank has also increased US$10 million, so the equalization fund is becoming more abundant, which is sufficient to stabilize the legal foreign exchange, consolidate the currency credit, and maintain the debt reputation. For the sake of protecting the legitimate business operations of friendly countries and merchants engaged in trade with China, the Shanghai black market foreign exchange will continue to maintain it at any time according to the needs of the market to ensure its lasting stability.</p>
<p>The Central Shanghai Bank Resumes Listing</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is preparing to resume the announcement of the legal exchange rate and equalization tax rate at 10:00 am every day today. It is said that the legal exchange rate will remain unchanged, that is, the British exchange rate will be one first and two pence and a half, the US exchange rate will be 30 US dollars, the French exchange rate will be 1080 francs, the German exchange rate will be 75 marks, and the Hong Kong exchange rate will be 95 Hong Kong dollars. The import of all necessities that have been approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee may apply for legal foreign exchange according to law. Regarding the black market foreign exchange, it shall be based on the listing of the HSBC Bank. Legitimate merchants shall be supplied as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Youth Day Various Circles are Preparing to Celebrate</h3>
<p>May 4 is the Student Movement Memorial Day and has been designated by the Central Government as China Youth Day. All sectors of the city's population recall the spirit of the youth and students at that time, under the power of the Northern Warlords, launching a bright and unyielding spirit to oppose the unreasonable demands of the Twenty-One Demands, fully demonstrating the sincere and enthusiastic psychology of protecting the country and the nation. Therefore, there was the May Fourth Movement of the Republic of China, and the National Revolution was able to progress smoothly and obtain the fruits of the completion of the Northern Expedition. At the time of the War of Resistance and National Construction, we should make redoubled efforts to promote the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, concentrate our will and strength, unite consistently under the established national policy of the Central Government, so we are actively preparing for a warm celebration to promote the perseverance of Chinese youth and strive for victory in the War of Resistance and National Construction.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Limits to be Abolished - Rice Merchants' Attitudes</h3>
<p>The rice merchant trade in this city, due to rice prices exceeding the set limits, with the black market premiums rising steadily, buying expensively and selling cheaply, making it impossible to sustain operations, had petitioned the rice merchant guild, imploring the authorities for relief. Simultaneously, they decided to voluntarily suspend market transactions temporarily and sent a written request to the rice merchant guild to forward to the authorities, urging strict adherence to price limits and complete elimination of black market premiums. The guild has already forwarded the request to the authorities of the two concessions, seeking instructions on how to proceed. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, more than two hundred rice merchant representatives gathered again at the guild to discuss solutions. They all agreed that although they had not entered the market to buy goods, newspaper reports indicated that black market rice prices were still rising. As direct sales outlets to retail stores catering to consumers, the complete abstention from market purchases by the rice merchants has not only failed to lower prices, but instead, the black market premiums have increased. The crux of the problem is self-evident. The representatives present voiced their opinions one after another and decided to continue the temporary suspension of market entry, awaiting instructions from the authorities to comply with. However, according to sources from the authorities, the banks will resume operations today, and the national and foreign rice price limits set on the 17th of this month will be implicitly abolished.</p>
<p>The Scenario of Manipulating Rice Prices Becomes More Obvious</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the rice market, the continued rise in rice prices in the city is purely due to the insistence of larger rice firms to hoard goods. These firms import rice from overseas at quite low costs, but repeatedly seize opportunities to raise prices and seek profits. Therefore, the entire food supply for the city's residents has reached the current state. The committee members of the bean, rice, and miscellaneous grains industries cannot escape blame. As an example, the authorities recently, with good intentions, urged the aforementioned two trade associations to cooperate with the authorities in purchasing low-priced rice supplied by the Hong Kong government. Unexpectedly, the committee members of the two associations refused outright, arguing that purchasing this rice would not only offer no substantial profits but also affect the future price limits on their vast stockpiles of rice. This reveals the intentions of these individuals. It is hoped that the authorities will impose strict sanctions.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>According to information obtained by the Datong News Agency reporter from Zhejiang organizations in Shanghai: (1) The Chinese troops in Ningbo have now repositioned to defend the area around Wangchun Bridge outside the West Gate, while the Japanese troops are besieged within the city, with both sides in a standoff. (2) The Japanese troops who invaded Shaoxing continued to reach Dongguan but have made no progress due to being blocked by the Cao'e River. (3) Chinese troops rushed to counterattack and recaptured Linhai on the 25th, and are now advancing towards Huangyan. (4) Intermittent fierce battles are still taking place in the suburbs of Wenzhou. (5) Foreign ships in this city have temporarily suspended sailings, and the rumors of resumption of sailings are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Fare Increases - French Concession Buses Implemented Yesterday - Rickshaw Fares to Increase</h3>
<p>Public buses and trolleybuses on various routes in the French Concession have increased fares several times since the war. Now, another round of fare increases has been implemented, with ordinary fares increasing by 2 to 6 cents per stop. The minimum fare has increased from 4 cents to 6 cents, further increasing the burden on ordinary residents. Everyone sincerely hopes that the company can actively reorganize its operations, increase company revenue, and reduce the burden on passengers. The rickshaw industry association in this city believes that the prices of metal parts and car materials have soared several times compared to this time last year. The current rickshaw fares are restricted by the Municipal Council, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, they have been discussing solutions for days. The consensus is that other rental cars, moving trucks, rental bicycles, public buses, trolleybuses, etc., have repeatedly raised prices automatically because they are not restricted by the authorities. This industry faces the same situation as the above-mentioned industries but cannot sustain the losses. Therefore, it has been decided to report the prices of various materials and the general situation to the Municipal Council for a review of rickshaw fares, appropriately increasing them to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Garbage Workers in the French Concession Striked Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Approximately 700 garbage collection workers employed by the Sanitation Department of the French Municipal Council recently demanded increases in wages and rice subsidies, along with more than ten other demands, due to the continuous rise in the price of rice and daily necessities in Shanghai, and their wages being insufficient to sustain their livelihoods. Because these demands were not met, they went on strike together at 1:00 AM yesterday morning. Upon receiving the news, the authorities immediately hired White Russian workers as replacements. Meanwhile, the police department dispatched patrol officers to maintain order, assigning one Chinese officer to each garbage truck to provide protection during operation and prevent incidents. Furthermore, it is reported that dozens of temporary workers among these workers had requested a wage increase. The authorities refused, arguing that temporary workers could not be compared to permanent workers, leading to the strike. Because yesterday was a Sunday holiday, negotiations have not yet begun. It is reported that the workers have already selected representatives and prepared a written statement to present to the authorities today to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3>Detained Southern Vessel to be Released - Italian Troops to be Withdrawn - Italian Response to Customs Protest Imminent - Port Authorities Deploy Marine Police on Board</h3>
<p>According to the Times newspaper, the Yugoslavian freighter "Toni Slav" has been detained by Italian sailors for the fifth day as of yesterday (the 26th), but there is hope that the vessel will be released soon. Although a response has not yet been received to the protest lodged by the Jianghai Customs Port Authority with the Italian Consulate General, the Italian side has informed Jianghai Customs that it acknowledges receipt of the protest and claims a response will be issued shortly. The condemnation of this incident by a Japanese naval spokesperson on Friday (the 25th) is sufficient indication that this matter should be concluded soon. At that time, the Italian troops will be withdrawn. Meanwhile, maritime police from the Port Authority and Italian sailors from the "Liban" gunboat remain stationed on the "Toni Slav," and there has been no friction between the two parties.</p>

<h3>Robbery of Vietnamese Policeman's Gun - Offender Dies</h3>
<p>At 7:00 AM on the 25th of this month, a No. 158 Vietnamese policeman from the Zhabei French Concession Police Station was on duty inside the iron gate of Xingsheng Street and Minguo Road when suddenly two fierce robbers wearing short clothes, one wielding a handgun, threatened the Vietnamese policeman to rob him of the service handgun he was carrying. The robbers turned around and fled from the Lane of the Great River, headed to Tianzhu Tang Street and then north to Fa Da Road, turning east towards the Bund of East Huangpu to run. The Vietnamese policeman who lost his gun chased closely behind, shouting wildly. When the two robbers fled to the front of No. 25 Fa Da Road, the patrol officers stationed in front of the French Consulate heard the alarm and helped with the pursuit. One of the two robbers actually took out a gun to resist arrest. The patrol officers also drew their guns and returned fire. The two sides exchanged about ten shots. The robber who resisted arrest was shot twice, collapsed to the ground, and was captured. The injuries were to the right rib and the upper left breast. The patrol officers immediately seized the handgun he was holding, but the robber who had robbed the gun had already escaped without a trace. The injured robber and the stolen gun were taken back to the police station and then sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the injured robber's name was Wang Guanqing, 31 years old, a Shanghai native living at No. 121 Danfeng Road, West Gate.

After the examination today, the Shan Tang will collect and bury the body. At the same time, the police station ordered detectives to strictly arrest the fleeing accomplices and bring them to justice for investigation.</p>
<h3>Hotel Teahouse Workers Fight at Guide Service Company - Both Sides Injured - Dispute over Commission - Results in Injuries on Both Sides</h3>
<p>At 7:30 yesterday morning, a group of teahouse workers from the Huangong Hotel on Zhejiang Road went to the Xinchun Guide Service Company at No. 647 Cide Lane, Guangnei Road, and started a fight. As a result, both sides were injured. Details obtained by the reporter from the News Agency are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Dispute over Commission Ends Unhappily</p>
<p>The incident stemmed from the fact that several guests in room 215 of the Huangong Hotel at No. 12, Lane 137, Zhejiang Road, were chatting with friends in room 423 of the Wugong Hotel on Fujian Road. They requested that a guide girl from the Xinchun Guide Service Company, Nan Rong (18 years old), accompany them. At around 10:00 PM that night, the guests returned to the Huangong Hotel and took the guide girl with them. It was not until 6:00 AM yesterday morning that they allowed the girl to return to the company. Before leaving, the guests paid her ten yuan for eight hours of service. The girl then paid the teahouse worker a commission of two yuan and four jiao (calculated at three jiao per hour), but the teahouse worker intended to deduct a commission of three yuan. However, the girl had already paid the teahouse worker at the Wugong Hotel six jiao when she went out, so she could not pay more and insisted that it was impossible. The two sides parted unhappily.</p>
<p>Teahouse Workers Go to Demand Justice and Start a Fight</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the head of the Huangong Teahouse, Xing Lifu, Wu Jiakang, and the teahouse worker Ding Chunlai, after discussing the matter, believed that this precedent could not be set. Therefore, at around 7:00 AM, they gathered more than ten teahouse workers from the entire hotel and rushed to Xinchun to demand justice. They went straight to the dormitory of the girls on the second floor, with a fierce momentum. At this time, there were six guide girls, including Meng Lijun and Xiao Linglong, sleeping in the dormitory, all of whom were awakened from their dreams. They shouted loudly. At the same time, the company's accountant, Feng Lansheng, the teahouse worker, Wan Hongsheng, and five other people rushed to stop them. The two sides went from arguing to fighting, and a brawl broke out. As a result, the police station received a report and rushed to the scene, arresting both sides. During the brawl, five people were injured, including Huangong teahouse workers Wu Jiakang (29 years old) from Jiangbei, Xing Lifu (24 years old), Wan Hongzhong (26 years old, local), and Xinchun's local accountant Feng Lansheng (20 years old), and Wang Chunlai (22 years old). They were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Yu Gong Antique Shop Robbery Case - Two Suspects Adjudicated and Awaiting Sentencing</h3>

After persuasion, they all returned to work at noon yesterday.

It is said that this was done by a certain ticket taker, implicating more than a dozen people, which aroused the response of other ticket takers to strike.</p>
<h3>Coastal Lighthouses and Lightships Have Been Slightly Repaired</h3>

<h3>Remembering General Xie Jinyuan</h3>
<p>— Ji Ze</p>
<p>General Xie Jinyuan, whose loyal and courageous battle record was admired by people all over the world, has now been murdered while harboring ambitions of seeking reward. Although his eyes are closed, we can still see the brilliance shining from them; although his mouth has stopped speaking, his resolute and heroic speeches still echo in our ears; although we can no longer see his heroic figure on horseback, we can clearly see him still waving his command sword. We will always believe that he was murdered—he will forever be among us, leading us.</p>
<p>Coming out of the Lone Army Camp, rubbing my tearful eyes, I looked up at the sky, which was wearing a mourning face. I returned home with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Under the glass on my desk, there is a full-body photo of him that I took myself three years ago.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1938, I was studying journalism. Under the guidance of our professor, more than thirty of us students collectively visited the Four Banks Warehouse defenders. In a simply furnished small reception room, General Xie Jinyuan warmly received us. We surrounded him, and he, wearing a white shirt, enthusiastically answered the questions of our classmates. His resolute and powerful Cantonese Mandarin easily touched our hearts. After we finished talking, I asked him to allow me to take a photo, and he readily agreed. I took the general's full-body photo outside the reception room. Who knew that it would now become his posthumous portrait! He was unfortunately murdered and will never rise again.</p>
<p>My second visit to the general was on the Double Tenth Festival of the same year. Before the Double Tenth Festival, the Lone Army Camp had a dispute over the flag-raising issue during the anniversary, which unfortunately led to a bloody incident involving the White Russian troops stationed there. The general was moved to the Tongshang Bank building on the Bund and was denied access to outsiders. This was considered the most painful experience for the general. After further negotiations, the general finally regained his freedom before the Double Tenth Festival. He talked to me in detail about the incident and searched for strong evidence in a large and thick scrapbook to show the misunderstanding of the concession authorities. He also explained his will that he would try his best to avoid all unnecessary disputes; but if violence were inflicted on him, he would make a proper resistance without any fear.</p>
<p>After that, I often walked around the Lone Army Camp. I took pictures of the daily life of the Lone Army Camp, and I collected old books and newspapers from relatives and friends to enrich the spiritual food of the warriors of the Lone Army. But I preferred to talk to the general, partly because of his enthusiasm and sincerity, and partly because of his rich wisdom. He asked me about everything in the Shanghai press, but I was just a journalism student. What could I understand? As a result, he gave me a lot of knowledge instead.</p>
<p>The general was not only brave, but also a learned scholar who never tired of learning. This was recognized by everyone who met with the general. His desk was piled high with books. I remember when I asked him to write an inscription in my commemorative album, he readily gave me the phrase "A warlike state has never perished" from Sun Tzu's Art of War. His writing was vigorous and unrestrained, which shows that the general's ability to make a name for himself was not accidental.</p>
<p>At the end of that year, I left Shanghai for eastern Zhejiang due to work reasons. When I went to the Lone Army Camp to say goodbye, he encouraged me with many words, just like a good teacher who patiently guides others.</p>
<p>Before I left Shanghai, I caused the general a disappointment due to a temporary oversight. This incident made me feel infinitely sorry for him for the rest of my life. Last summer, when I returned to Shanghai, the first thing I did was to run to him to confess my mistake. He did not mind at all, and flatly denied that it was caused by my negligence, and told me not to hold any grudges, and told me to come and play with him often. This made me feel even more uneasy.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the general was killed by treacherous soldiers! No, although his physical body is dead, his soul is eternal and will never disappear!</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Examines the Latest Developments in the Terminology of Academic Disciplines</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The terminology of various academic disciplines in our country is independently translated by scholars in each field, resulting in discrepancies and inconsistencies, which greatly hinders the progress of academic research. After the establishment of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, the compilation and revision of terminology became one of its important tasks. The compilation process involves first collecting English, German, French, and Japanese terms for each discipline, carefully considering existing translations, carefully selecting and translating them, and then having the Ministry of Education hire domestic experts to organize a review committee to review them. Each compilation often requires two or three years of careful discussion before it can be published. Since the establishment of the Bureau in 1933, the terminology of fifteen disciplines, including astronomy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, has been published. Thirty-two disciplines, including philosophy, sociology, politics, and economics, have been compiled or sent to experts for review. Thirty-three disciplines, including anthropology, physiology, pathology, and physical education, are in the process of being compiled. Currently, the terminology of seven disciplines, including society, education, economics, statistics, electrical engineering (power section), mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering, has been individually reviewed by experts in each discipline. The Ministry of Education convened a terminology review meeting on March 26, bringing together more than ninety scientific experts in education, social studies, economics, statistics, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. The meeting lasted for several days, and the review results were very satisfactory.</p>

<h3>The Tonghui Elementary School Teacher Strike Still Shows No Sign of Resuming Classes</h3>
<p>The education authorities maintain their original stance. Although the teacher strike at the private Tonghui Elementary School in this city was jointly discussed and mediated yesterday by education officials, the chairman of the school board, and representatives of the faculty and staff, there is still no sign of a quick resolution. The reporter of Dahua News Agency recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, education officials first sent personnel to the school to inspect the current state of the school and the actual damage to the school equipment. It is reported that more than eighty broken glass panels have been repaired by the faculty and staff themselves. The damage to fifty or sixty sets of desks and chairs is not too serious and has also been repaired by hired workers. Subsequently, at 4 PM, they met with the chairman of the school board, Zong Pan, and the representatives of the faculty and staff, Chuanying, Gu Zongying, and Qu Lifan, for a joint discussion. First, the officials strongly urged the faculty and staff to resume classes first and then seek solutions later. Secondly, the chairman of the school board explained the intention of the board of directors to accept the principle of raising the salaries of the faculty and staff, which can be further discussed by the board of directors. As for the amount of funds in the corruption case, it should also be recovered. The issue of teacher security can be handled by the principal after the resumption of classes. Finally, the officials earnestly persuaded the faculty and staff to prepare for the resumption of classes today and officially start classes tomorrow. The representatives of the faculty and staff agreed to convey this intention, but it is learned that the faculty and staff of the school still maintain their original attitude, so there is still little hope for the resumption of classes tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Ding Fubao Gave a Lecture Yesterday on the Art of Health and Longevity, Listing Ten Key Points of Health</h3>
<p>The academic lecture series initiated by Shou Yong, Zhu Bingnan, Tang Wenzhi, Jiang Weiqiao, and other elder figures in the academic circles of this city was held for the second time yesterday morning at 10 AM in the Xuan Gong Theater of the Pudong Fellow Association. Ding Fubao was invited to speak on the art of health and longevity. More than 700 people attended, filling the theater. Ding, nearly 70 years old, is old but vigorous. Huang Zunhua first stood up to introduce Ding as a senior figure in the academic circle, especially rich in research on medicine, and so on. Then Ding gave a lecture, saying that his body was weak in the past, but he studied medicine and health, practiced physical training, and was able to turn weakness into strength. He then elaborated on the principles of health in ten points:</p>
<p>(1) Rice must be unpolished rice. Eating too much white rice will cause beriberi. As for pork and various animals, they all have toxic substances and are most likely to cause disease, so vegetables are the most suitable. Water is also beneficial. Pearl rice is the most nutritious and can replace white rice, which is more beneficial to life.</p>
<p>(2) Take a deep breath once a day to prevent tuberculosis. There is no good medicine to cure tuberculosis, only air injections.</p>
<p>(3) Have a bowel movement once a day to excrete the waste from the stomach and intestines, otherwise, dizziness and bloating will occur, and all kinds of diseases will arise.</p>
<p>(4) Get enough sleep. The windows of the bedroom must be kept open at all times, day and night, to allow air to circulate.</p>
<p>(5) Abstinence is the first priority. Diseases such as nocturnal emission, headaches, and blurred vision all come from unwillingness to abstain.</p>
<p>(6) Exercise should be reduced after the age of forty, as it will degenerate. If exercise is too strenuous, it is easy to cause disease, so do not overdo it.</p>
<p>(7) Sunlight is the best. It can eliminate diseases. Exposing yourself to the sun is good for your body. Make sure that sunlight enters the room.</p>
<p>(8) Bathing is also beneficial to the body. Once or two or three times a day is best to take a cold bath.</p>
<p>(9) Mental stability is sufficient to maintain health. Always be content and never look for trouble yourself. Treat people and things with a calm and peaceful attitude.</p>
<p>(10) Although religions are different, such as the compassion of Buddhism in our country, it is also sufficient to cultivate oneself and cultivate one's nature.</p>
<h3>Lecture on Learning: How to Study Physics (4)</h3>
<p>— Xu Ziwei</p>
<p>10. The Work of Creation and Organization. After reading each article and each chapter, you should do some organization work to make the knowledge you have learned a systematic and orderly concept. In terms of verticality, it is best to follow the program of the textbook to write a brief summary. In terms of horizontality, it is best to classify and collect materials within physics and conduct a comprehensive study. Now list several items and give examples as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Terminology… such as density, specific gravity, gravity, pressure, center of gravity, speed, work, friction… You should write its definition, formula, and unit, and give examples to illustrate. Now take pressure as an example to illustrate below:</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>The force received per unit area is called the intensity of pressure, or simply pressure.</p>
<p>Formula</p>
<p>Unit</p>
<p>Depends on the unit of force and area, such as gram per square centimeter (g/cm2), pound per square inch (lb/in2), mercury column height, air pressure—air pressure = 76cm mercury column height = 1033.6 g/cm2</p>
<p>(2) Definition… such as Archimedes' principle, Pascal's principle, Hooke's law, Boyle's law… etc. You should write its explanation, formula, and give examples to illustrate. Now take Archimedes' principle as an example to illustrate below:</p>
<p>Principle</p>
<p>The weight that an object loses in a liquid (partially or fully immersed in a liquid or gas) is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the object.</p>

<h3>The Paramount Ballroom Basketball Team Will Return to Shanghai Next Week</h3>
<p>The Paramount Ballroom basketball expedition team, which traveled to the Philippines in the middle of last month together with the Hong Kong Eastern Football Team, unfortunately had a dispute on the third day of their visit to the Philippines. Later, the Eastern Football Team returned early. The Paramount Ballroom team stayed for more than ten days due to the strong retention of the local overseas Chinese. Its leader, Gu Qikang, had also returned to the north earlier, and his troops were handed over to Chen Fuyu to lead. However, when the Paramount Ballroom team would return was not known until yesterday, when two letters, one from Manila airmail and one from Hong Kong express mail, arrived in Shanghai at the same time. It was learned that the expedition team did not leave Manila until the 18th, and there were two charity matches and two friendly matches in Hong Kong. It is estimated that the team will not be able to return until the end of next week.</p>

<h3>The Outer Space</h3>
<p>— Jing Gu</p>
<p>The universe is a mysterious thing. It is often doubted by people. The ancient people without scientific brains said that it was ruled by a god. The most advanced scientists of the twentieth century said that it is endlessly expanding... Let's not worry about that for now.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about is "The Outer Space". Looking at the name, it seems strange. In fact, if you break it down, it's not worth a penny.</p>
<p>Because "The Outer Space" is the space outside the troposphere!</p>
<p>The troposphere should be a very common word. Simply put, it is the space six to ten miles from the ground. According to measurements, the temperature in this space is minus fifty degrees Celsius, so it is called the troposphere.</p>
<p>In the troposphere, because the air is thin, you cannot survive without bringing oxygen with you. However, above the troposphere, the air is extremely thin. People simply cannot go up, so scientists came up with a way to install the necessary machinery on a balloon and let it record the situation there.</p>
<p>The interesting thing happened. Everyone thought (even the most advanced scientists) that the higher the altitude, the lower the temperature. However, according to the "Mechanical" report, the temperature began to rise from the troposphere upwards, all the way to 100 miles from the ground. The temperature there is as high as 900 degrees Celsius, which is a ball of hot shell. The ability of radio waves to transmit far is also because when the waves are shot upwards, they fall to the hot shell layer and are refracted downwards (similar to the reflection of light). Therefore, radar waves are transmitted so far away.</p>
<p>According to this "report", we can infer that the scientists are racking their brains to try to communicate with "people" on Mars and other planets, but it has now been proven to be absolutely impossible. Because it is impossible for us "humans" to pass through this hot shell of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius!</p>
<h3>Suggesting a New Type of Clothing—Intelligence Outfit</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhai</p>
<p>Nowadays, people in society feel that Chinese clothing (referring to long robes) has many shortcomings, so changing to Western clothing (referring to casual wear, Zhongshan suits, and student uniforms) is becoming more and more common. Almost half of my friends wear Western clothing, and I myself have worn it for more than ten years. However, is Western clothing a perfect type of clothing? I have frankly discussed this issue with many friends. Everyone believes that Western clothing has no other advantages except that it is economical in materials, convenient for walking, and has many pockets. Chinese clothing also has many advantages except that it is not economical in materials, inconvenient for doing things and walking, and has few pockets.</p>
<p>Here, I suggest a new type of clothing, tentatively named "Intelligence Outfit". It is designed to eliminate the shortcomings of both Chinese and Western clothing and collect the strengths of both, and is extremely suitable for casual wear.</p>
<p>(See attached picture) I will now explain it one by one. Please give your expert guidance.</p>
<p>The length of this "Intelligence Outfit" is only two inches above the knee (city ruler), which is five or six inches shorter than the popular Western overcoat. This makes it as convenient as Western clothing for action, warmer than Western clothing, but saves the large pieces of material on the front and back of Chinese clothing. The sleeve length is only to the wrist, and the cuff size is about four inches. These are all the same as Western clothing, which makes it very convenient for doing things. The shoulder cut adopts the Chinese style, because our arms are rarely completely drooping. Even for people who do the least amount of labor, such as writing, their arms are not completely drooping. However, if you are making thick clothes (such as cotton clothes), you can remove a piece of cotton wool from the armpit or reduce it to extremely thin, so that you do not feel uncomfortable when completely drooping, and you are not restrained when raising your arms. The collar is two-thirds as high as the neck, and the front is lower. It can adopt the student uniform style, and it is also suitable to install a pair of buttons to make the appearance more neat. The front of the garment adopts a straight front style, which can save some material; therefore, the common Chinese-style short-sleeved garment is not used, so that it is somewhat different from this kind of short-sleeved garment to cater to the psychology of "distinguishing oneself from the non-intellectual world". This psychology is a manifestation of human self-esteem and does not need to be stopped. The waist is quite large, so movement is very convenient, very comfortable, cool in summer, and very hygienic. The hem can be the same size as the waist, and open a few inches on the left and right sides to make walking easier. Buttons can be knotted or machine-made. Pockets can be installed at will, and it is okay to have them on the outside. The pants also adopt the Chinese style. Although the material used in the waist is more than Western pants, it is still cost-effective because the wearing time is doubled. The upper garment is designed to be so long in order to cover the crotch area. The leg of the trousers should not be too big, and the leg opening should only be about seven inches. The length is level with the ankle, one or two inches shorter than Western trousers.</p>
<p>The tailoring method of this "Intelligence Outfit" completely adopts the Chinese clothing method, which is very simple, and even if you ask someone to make it, the labor cost is cheaper than Western clothing.</p>
<p>I am not good at drawing, so I cannot express all the beautiful points of the "Intelligence Outfit". But you can also see that wearing this "Intelligence Outfit" is quite impressive and elegant, and there is no sign of depression, nor is there any rudeness. At most, because you are not used to seeing it, it is a little unsightly.</p>
<p>I respectfully offer this economical, convenient and comfortable clothing to practical and reform-minded intellectuals.</p>
<h3>Broad Bean Seeds</h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>The season tells us that cherries will soon be red and plantain trees will be green. The only delicious food—broad bean seeds—is now on the market again.</p>
<p>Broad bean seeds are the delicious fruit that comes from the metamorphosis of broad beans. Broad beans (Vicia faba), a plant name, belong to the legume family. It is an annual herb, about three feet tall, with square, hollow stems and pinnate compound leaves. The leaflets are four to six in number, oblong in shape, and the stems and leaves are soft and juicy. In spring, flowers bloom in the leaf axils, with white petals and purple-black markings, papilionaceous corollas, and short racemes. The fruit is a pod, usually erect, and the seeds are used for food or for brewing sauces and soy sauce. The stems and leaves are used as fertilizer and for feeding livestock. The small broad bean has a very wide range of uses.</p>
<p>The most famous broad bean seeds in my hometown (Wuxi) are those from Qianqiao Township and Huishan, followed by Rongxiang and other areas. Every morning, the sons and daughters of farming families carry them to the market, shoulder to shoulder, heel to heel. Broad bean seeds and bean pods fill baskets, providing a great sideline for farming families. Farm women call out loudly, "Beans are wanted!..." Their oriole-like voices are delightful to hear. The Qianqiao beans are round and green, resembling jade treasures, and are extremely tender. Before the war, each catty of beans was sold for only a dozen copper coins, and each catty of bean pods for only six or seven copper coins (less than three cents). Therefore, it was not surprising that housewives bought them as snacks. Cooked with rich sauce and sugar, they are tender, glutinous, and flavorful! They are truly a great treat, not just for accompanying meals. Nowadays, with prices soaring, one can imagine that these emerald green broad bean seeds are worth much more than in the past.</p>

<h3>Weekly Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>For the past month, we have often used yellow croaker, which is relatively inexpensive, as one of our meat dishes every day. Although we are getting tired of it, meat is still meat, and we can't do without it every day. Unexpectedly, with the fall of Ningbo, the price has doubled, and it is also hard to find bloody fresh goods. As for other fish, they always cost more than ten cents per tael. A small fish costs six or seven cents at once, which really makes people sigh "no fish to eat." Well, since it is not easy to eat cheap fresh fish, let's eat salted yellow croaker, salted ribbonfish, salted hairtail and other preserved goods several times a week. Although they are salty, they can still be served with rice and can also make you be merciful with your chopsticks and eat less.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Stir-fried water bamboo shoots with shredded pork, sweet and sour salted ribbonfish, radish shreds with scallions</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>Beef with yellow bean sprouts, stir-fried whitebait with scrambled eggs, braised garland chrysanthemum leaves, vegetarian tofu soup</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>

<h3>Rickshaws in Changsha</h3>
<p>— Zhong Pei</p>
<p>While working in Changsha, the only mode of transportation is the rickshaw. However, if you are new to Changsha, you will find that the rickshaws there are the "tycoons" of all rickshaws. You can easily be annoyed by them. Therefore, people living in Changsha often advise new friends not to try it easily, so as not to "move earth" and get bored for no reason.</p>
<p>The only special feature is that the rickshaw pullers are unwilling to run. When you get into his rickshaw, he will slowly pace his steps, neither running nor walking quickly. If you are impatient and urge him, if he is happy, he will ignore you and continue walking. If he is also unhappy, or if you urge him repeatedly, he will simply stop, ask you to get out of the car, and say, "You run yourself, I don't do this business." He doesn't ask you for money or give you a tip, but just follows you and sees if you run or not, and then asks you why you don't run yourself... This is considered good. Even worse, if you urge him, he'll ask you to come down, sit on it himself, and ask you to pull and run for him, making you unable to cry or laugh and helpless to him!</p>
<p>Sometimes you want him to run, and he will, but you must make it clear in advance that you want to run. The price must be more than double, and only one or two out of ten will respond. As for when it rains, there is definitely no running. Can you imagine a master holding a Hunan oil-paper umbrella and wearing Du-made wooden clogs pulling you to run?</p>
<p>In addition, another feature is the lack of haggling. Once a rickshaw puller has said two cents, no other rickshaw puller will offer one cent and eight cents. This is also something that other places do not have. Other habits, such as a rickshaw puller who has received a considerable price today will never want to pull again, all show the stubbornness of our "home of soldiers." Changsha, the rickshaws in Changsha with a strong Hunan flavor.</p>

<h3>Human Nature</h3>
<p>— Sun Jianbai</p>
<p>I've been hungry all day and really don't know what to do. Borrowing from others: All the friends I know have already been borrowed from. After thinking about it, only Old Ma has never been asked. He is a "rogue," but I have to try my luck.</p>
<p>This guy never has a home, so it's really not easy to find him. After stumbling around for most of the day, I finally found him in a teahouse.</p>
<p>I told him a lot about my suffering, and finally begged him to help me a little for the sake of old friendship.</p>
<p>He smoked a cigarette while listening to me. After I finished speaking, he sighed, shook his head a few times, and then said to me with great sympathy:</p>
<p>"Brother! It's not that I'm saying this to you today, but you are too loyal! Otherwise, with your body, you would have followed me a long time ago, and you wouldn't have ended up like this. But your courage is small and your temper is so strong, how can you not suffer everywhere!" He paused here, staring at me. I couldn't help but lower my head, but I felt impatient in my heart: Damn it! I'm here to borrow money, not to listen to your lessons. According to my temper, I have to get up and leave, but my stomach is grumbling, so I can only endure it.</p>
<p>"However, everyone has embarrassing times. Since you, brother, came to me, Ma, I can't let you go back empty-handed!" He spoke slowly, took out two one-dollar bills from his pocket, looked at the numbers, and handed them to me.</p>
<p>"Here, it's two dollars. You probably know my situation. I don't have much money. This little bit can only be considered a small token of my appreciation!"</p>
<p>I took the money and couldn't help but thank him very much. I said:</p>
<p>"Old Ma! Thank you so much for helping me out of my emergency. I will definitely pay you back when I have money!"</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, brother! What's there to thank between brothers? However, I think it's not a solution for you to always borrow money from friends like this. You have to find something to do, right?" He suddenly frowned, looking at the sky, as if he was thinking of a way for me.</p>
<p>"What you said is true. I also think so, but I can't leave. It's really not easy to find something to do. I can only ask you, brother!" After being out for a long time, I finally managed to say these few words.</p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm," he smoked and sipped tea. After a while, he suddenly looked me up and down and then said:</p>
<p>"Brother, what kind of robe are you wearing? It doesn't look very old."</p>
<p>"Camel hair. It's embarrassing to say, but I only have this one magic robe!" I looked at my robe and thought of the dozen or so pawn tickets at home, and couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p>
<p>"Brother, I've come up with an idea now. I don't know if you're willing to lend me your robe for a while?" He suddenly said to me in a very low voice, with a very excited expression.</p>
<p>"What's the idea? What's the use of my robe?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"A way to make money! You know I'm good at mahjong, but I don't have the capital to gamble with others. Now, if you take off your robe and lend it to me, I can pawn it for ten dollars and go to the general assembly to play a game of mahjong. If I win money, we brothers will split it evenly. I guarantee there won't be any problems. I just don't know if you're willing to lend it to me? Do you believe me, Ma?" He said very seriously, looking at me.</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I believe you, but..." I hesitated, thinking quickly in my mind.</p>
<p>"It's okay. You can wait for me at your house. It'll take me at most three hours. Eight rounds of mahjong are very fast, and I'll come find you as soon as I'm done playing!"</p>
<p>I couldn't hesitate any longer, gritted my teeth, and took off my robe, thinking, "Old Ma won't "flake out" in front of a poor friend like me, will he? After all, we're old brothers!" Thinking this, I handed the robe to him.</p>
<p>He took the robe and asked the waiter to calculate the tea money. Then, he walked out of the teahouse with me.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the teahouse, we parted ways. Before leaving, he repeatedly told me that he would be back in three hours at most. I agreed and hurried home, because although the weather wasn't cold, walking outside in just a shirt and pants didn't look very good.</p>
<p>After returning to my home on the mezzanine floor, I first ordered a bowl of noodles from the noodle stall in the alley and ate it, then sat quietly waiting for Old Ma.</p>
<p>Money, robe, Old Ma, were all circling in my mind.</p>
<p>I waited until dark, but Old Ma still hadn't come. Calculating, it had been more than six hours.——I had been "tricked."</p>
<p>That way, not only did I get nothing, but I also lost my robe and couldn't even go outside!</p>
<p>In short, "Heaven never seals off all exits." The next morning, my cousin Ruisheng came to see me. He brought me thirty dollars, and I was able to get through this "gate of hell"!</p>
<p>However, I could never find Old Ma again. Maybe he was afraid of meeting me and being scolded by me. In fact, I just felt that I was really too "loyal."</p>
<h3>Small Bugs Become Big Bugs</h3>
<p>— Sun Jiacan</p>
<p>The "moth," at this time when the spark has already started a prairie fire, its "worth" has suddenly increased "a hundredfold," and it can hardly be regarded as a "small bug." Therefore, it is honored as a "tiger," a "big bug."</p>
<p>It is said that dragons follow clouds, and "tigers" follow "wind." The tighter the "wind," the higher the "surge." The higher the "surge," the more "full" the "tiger's power" becomes. Don't you see that "beasts" bare their fangs and claws, wanting to devour the poor and all their kind before they are satisfied?</p>
<p>It was already difficult enough that the East Mountain "tiger" had just run away, but the West Mountain "tiger" came again. Originally, "that mountain tiger doesn't eat people." If it "doesn't eat people," what is it doing as a "tiger"?</p>
<p>"Raising a tiger brings disaster." You are considered lucky. But wait, one day, you'll see "our family's Wu Er coming"! Be careful, the "big bug" will become a "dead bug."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) A Cross Drawn on Her Face</p>
<p>Although he told Qiu Haitang about this later, on that day after dinner, when the mute girl was about to leave, Qiu Haitang had to make many gestures to her, asking her to quietly sneak back to the Yuan residence several times that night to help the nanny take care of Xiao Meibao; because not only was Xiao Meibao running a fever, but she had also been in a daze. According to the doctor Yukun brought, she might even have a convulsion. And Xiangqi absolutely couldn't go home to take care of her these days, so this mute girl had become an indispensable character.——Despite being deaf and mute, she worked very diligently and quickly.</p>
<p>"Second Brother, can I discuss something with you?" After Qiu Haitang saw her daughter take her medicine, she walked out with Yukun; when she was about to leave, she turned her face sideways, frowned, and asked him softly.</p>
<p>Yukun shrugged his shoulders, not looking at him.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be to discuss my head with me, would it?"</p>
<p>"Don't joke!" Qiu Haitang smiled reluctantly. "I think Meibao's illness is not minor, and her mother definitely can't go back to see her. As for me, if they make a lot of noise with eating, drinking, and singing tonight, I may not be able to leave for sure. Fortunately, Tianle is very close to the Yuan residence. After your performance, come to the Yuan residence once, just say you have something urgent to discuss with me, then we can sneak back."</p>
<p>Of course, Yukun couldn't refuse this, but no matter how clever he was, he couldn't have foreseen that the reason he went to the Yuan residence later wasn't that Qiu Haitang was tied up by the eating, drinking, and singing; what happened in the evening was such a terrifying accident.</p>
<p>As soon as Qiu Haitang stepped through the gate of the Yuan residence, she seemed to notice that the old Zhang who was in charge of the gate gave her a very flustered wink, but she and Old Zhang never spoke to each other, and she really couldn't figure out why he would wink at her; moreover, there was also a servant and a bodyguard sitting in the gatehouse, and Old Zhang's expression seemed very afraid, which made Qiu Haitang not dare to ask him rashly.</p>
<p>"What does this mean?" She hesitated all the way, walking slowly toward the inner courtyard, and sat down in the room that Yuan Baofan usually used as a lounge, and looked at the clock on the wall, which was pointing to 5:31. (92)</p>
