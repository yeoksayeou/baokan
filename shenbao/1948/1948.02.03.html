<h3>開發台灣富源工鑛　中美進行技術商談　我向美提出援華新計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕頃悉：中美方面正進行對開發台省富源及扶植台繼工礦事業之商談，台省礦產豐富，如經開發，對國內工業之發展及轍出吸收外匯均有裨益，美方對此極願投資協助。並着重於兩點，一爲經濟的，即對工礦事業之扶植，一爲軍事的，美將助我完成我在台海軍根據地之計劃，現此項投資合作，在原則上已不成間題，目前正就技術問題硏究中，如獲實現，美除以經濟援我外，並將以大批技術人員遺台，協助工作進行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京二日電〕負責人士稱：魏德邁將軍實地調査中國局勢時，曾提出華南經濟復興方案，據謂：華南政治與經濟如能安定，美國自願給予援助。故宋子文就任廣東省政府主席以來，即採取各種步驟，使該區成爲全國化學工業中心，並力謀發展交通與其他工商業。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕美國援華貸款問題頃有新發展。據可靠方面消息：我政府已向美方表示，希望在可能情况下，獲得美方按年之長期援助，以代替馬歇爾國務卿所提按月援助之計劃，我方提出此項新計劃原因，係以馬歇爾之三億貸款分十五個月貸予，每月僅有二千萬美元，僅供作平衡我外匯收支之用，然我國目前情形所需之援助，不僅平衡外匯收支一端，尙有　緊縮通貨，　增加生產，均爲常務之返，上述三者均非按月援助二千萬美元所能濟事，故希望改爲按年長期援助，以澈底解決我國之經濟難題，此項希望，業經我政府轉達美國務院，美方是否同意，現尙不悉。另據靈通方面人士稱，我國外匯收支差額，去年爲二億五千萬美元，今年情况較佳，估計外匯收支差額將爲二億一千萬美元，馬歇爾所提援華貸款三億美元，分十五個月付給之計劃，僅足以使我外匯收支趨於平衡。</p>
<p>美起草援華方案現已至最後階段</p>
<p>〔路透社南京二日電〕此間官方人士，對於美國對華援助之前途均表樂觀，現在華盛頓及南京，正從事努力，使馬歇爾國務卿之建議得於二月廿日以前向國會提出，在華盛頓方面，由貝祖詒及顧維鈞大使向美國方面力陳中國之需要援助，而在南京方面，則由蔣主席及張羣院長不時與司徒雷登大使商量辦法，使中國有獲得援助之資格。此問人士相信，美國國會，終能以馬歇爾方案爲基礎，通過對華貸欲，尙待磋商者，僅爲數額及時間問題，職是之故，此間對於級約州長杜咸主張在今後三至四年內每年以二億五千萬元以上之援助給予中國之議，極感興趣。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日合衆電〕美國務卿馬歇爾，將於二日向國會提出援外新法案，此一法案乃用以防止意外事端，其中包括撥款援華，及撥款供佔領軍之需。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕國務院人員一日夜宣布：起草援華計劃已至最後階段。國務院經濟專家並根據各種情報，凖備供馬歇爾答復范登堡請示世界各國需要美援之總淸單。此通盤報吿，將包括歐洲復興計劃，援華計劃及國務部認爲必要之其他計劃在內，尙需數日方能準備就緒。</p>

<h3>迎西藏商務代表團東來</h3>
<p>西藏商務代表團一行，在團長及古巴率領之下，經由印度香港，於十八日行抵上海，次日晋謁吳市長，並已於一昨入京，晋謁蔣主席及有關方面致敬。該團將於在京小作勾留後，重來滬上，對本市工商業作一番考察。對於此一代表團的束來，不辭旅程長途跋涉之艱辛，觀光京滬，足爲中國民族精誠團結之又一新表現。我們謹於歡送新疆靑年歌舞團的同時，對西藏商務代表團表示熱誠的歡迎。</p>
<p>西藏人民，同爲中華民族之構成分子，情同手足，原無彼此之分：祗以西藏地處邊陲，交通梗阻，彼此之間，不免睽隔。此情此景，與新疆正復相同。我們忝居長兄，對於西藏情形，時深關注。故中央曾數度派員人藏，期使中藏之間，關係益臻親密。滬市府沈秘書長卽爲當年啣命入藏大員，旅居斯地，於增强中藏關係上，供獻尤多。顧人民與人民間之關係，重在往還，必有往而有還，然後方能增進彼此間相互之了解。我們之期待西藏代表團東來者，歷時已久，今乃有西藏商務代表團的蒞臨京滬，共將有助於中藏間相互了解之增進，不待多言。我捫願代表團一行的旅居康泰！</p>
<p>西藏商務代表團在這一個時候東來，其意　尤爲深長。世界第二次大戰結束到如今已兩年了，而世界的擾攘如故，和平秩序的重建，依舊還是一個未實現的理想。且更使人隱慮的，目前表面上的紛爭，還有它內在的更深的含義。若干人士已認世界分裂爲二；假使世界果眞分裂爲二；我們已一再聲稱，這分裂不是東方與西方的對立，而是嫉恨與仁愛，民主與極權的對立。嫉恨可能吸引更多的羣衆，正如極權在民主的偽裝之下，也可能吸引更多的羣衆一樣。基於嫉恨及極權的希特勒主義雖然打倒了，代之而起　却還有另一基於嫉恨及　權的體系。我們不相信歷史會重演，但我們不能不重視歷史的敎訓。這歷史的敎訓是什麽？那就是基於嫉恨及極權的體系是經不起歷史的試騐，必然會傾覆的；雖然它也許可以稱覇一時，像過去的希特勒和墨索里尼一樣。西藏商務代表團的東來，正在這一基於嫉恨及極權體系企圖稱覇的時候，我們要於此喚起他們對於歷史的警覺，提高他們的注意。須知所謂「香格里拉」云云，這原是文人筆下所虛構的「烏托邦」；在今日這一種以無綫電·飛機·火箭·雷達·及原子能爲特徵的時代，已不再有所謂「世外桃源」。代表團此行自印度飛蒞京滬，必可知所謂空間的距離，如今全已打破。那末，在此時代情形之下，應該如何自處，何待多贅？</p>
<p>就西藏的歷史與地理的關係言，中藏之問，此後的關係更應緊密。西藏四面皆山，入藏孔道，率多自東而西，或經雲南，或經靑海，或往西康。故在地理的方位上中國內地之與西藏，實爲一地理的單位。自辛亥革命以後，我們又有五族共和之號，漢藏之間，情同兄弟。去歲國民大會制定憲法，以中華民國爲基於三民主義之共和國；而三民主義之民族主義，則又以外求中國民族之自由平等，內求構成中國民族各宗族之自由平等爲目的，其出發點爲仁愛。今代表團東來，正當我國行憲之會，我們願代表團他日西返，能將我們對於藏胞的期待，也一同帶回去，使中國與西藏間的關係，益臻親密，彼此和衷合作，來致力於這一個三民主義共和國的建設。</p>
<p>然而此次西藏商務代表團的東來，其主要的目的，却在增進中藏間的商務經濟關係。中藏之間，互通有無，原屬必要。西藏所需要於我們的有茶葉，綢緞，和磁器；它可能輸出給我們的有藥材，毛織品之屬。這一神經濟上的往來，共目的不僅在貨暢其流，抑亦足以增進彼此間的了解，在目前這種國際形勢下，尤屬必要。但以中藏間道路的梗阻，此項往來，遂致進行不易，良可遺憾。在我們這一方而所應努力的，似　甚於發展中藏間的交通，期使此後中藏間的往來，可以不再繞道印度。康藏，及靑海與西藏，雲南與西藏之間，原應興築公路鐵道；設或此項建設需款鉅而一時不易成，亦應迅籌中藏之間的航空交通。至於對藏貿易，政府尤應鼓勵。在政府的貿易機構，如中央信託局的易貨糾織，首應加以倡導。不過，據說中藏之間的交通梗阻，原也有人爲的因素存在其間。所以我們也希望藏方當局，能够了然於增進中藏關係之必要，毅然排除一切人爲的障礙，庶幾中藏間的接觸能够日趨頻繁，而漢藏間的情感也能够日益深厚。</p>

<h3>美機在黃海作空中巡邏　蘇聯向美提抗議　指此舉侵犯蘇商航自由</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二日電〕莫斯科電台二日揭露：蘇聯最近加强反美外交戰聲中，已正式抗議美國在伊朗之軍事活動，並抗議美國飛機對蘇聯遠東航輪作「似察飛行」。</p>
<p>該廣播引證塔斯社消息稱：「蘇聯外交部於上月三十日，曾致照會與美駐蘇大使，抗議美國飛機包括飛行堡壘在內，在黃海與日本海向蘇聯商船低飛偵察，有時出以俯衝威脅，侵犯商船之航行自由，蘇聊船員及乘客對此均表憤慨。此種飛行乃美國在距離其領海甚遠之黃海及日本海樹立管制之粗暴企圖。此類空中活動僅可視爲不願顧及他國南船運輸合法利益之表示。職是之故，深盼美國負責當局應訓令不得再有同樣侵害情事。」</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕國務部正在硏究蘇聯此一抗議照會並起草　文，予以斷然駁斥，殆在意料之中。另據東京電稱，盟總認爲在黃海空中巡邏，乃其管轄職權以內之事，不認美機在黃海及日本海巡邏構成侵犯商船主權之行爲。　　〔合眾社東京二日電〕遠東空軍官員二日對外傳蘇聯所稱美國空中學壘在日木海及黃海一帶，在蘇輪上空飛行一事，拒絕作任何正式評論，並指出所傳抗議係向國務院提出者，故此問無須作任何說明。渠等指出，蘇聯對佔領當局之抨擊，向華盛頓或在莫斯科提抗議，而不通知此間負責當局已非一次。按照手續，華盛頓將要求東京盟總呈交正式報吿，然後答　克里姆林。前此之抨擊謂美機飛越千島羣島之國境，此間已作非正式解釋，謂因航綫錯誤或氣候不良，始發生此種事件。美方從未有意作此抓行動者也。　　〔合衆社東京二日電〕據此問非官方而意見，蘇聯對美機在黃海與日木海面上空偵察蘇商船之抗議，美政府將加以拒絕。蓋美機在上述各區之飛行，乃正軌之航空活動之一部份，蘇聯在法理上無權抗議也。蘇聯爲何作此抗議，此間尙未能完全明瞭，然據若千方而稱，蘇聯或乃「心虛」乎。憶及中國非官方而會一再斷言蘇輪曾替中共自蘇聯控制下之南滿港口運武器經過黃河至魯北也。蘇聯控指美機向蘇「俯衝」之說，似不正確者，蓋此種動作不僅危險，且對於偵察並無帮助也。</p>
<h3>蘇大使照會伊朗　抗議美軍事團在伊活動　謂足構成對蘇邊境威脅</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科二日電〕眞理報德黑閘記者電稱，蘇聯最近致伊朗政府之照會，列舉若千事實，證明美國軍事顧問在有關伊朗軍務之問題中，担任決定性的任務，且從事指導活動，使伊朗變爲美國之軍略基地。該記者並謂，伊朗陸軍在美國軍事顧問領導下，已獲得美國軍事配備，其型式與美國給予土耳其陸軍者相同。且伊朗軍之武器，係由美國基於信用賒貸方式給予。一九四七年初美國軍事顧問即已擬　伊陸軍改組之計劃，復經伊王批准，即成伊朗軍隊機構之基礎。伊朋參謀木部內有特委會之設，其中包括美軍顧問，根據美國方式朮草伊朗陸軍之規律，美顧問且擬　改組伊如陸軍部之計劃，規定依照美國技術重新配備伊朗軍需工業，使其得以製造並修理美式武器。</p>
<p>此外在美顧問要求及領導之下，已在伊朗建立大飛機塲一處，　置美國器械，就該機塲之而積及美顧問所表示之特別興趣觀，，望而知該機塲非供伊朗飛機之用。美國代表之在伊朗南部建立地下油庫，尤不容忽視。近數月來，美國顧問及其他美國代表復接踵而至伊朗，更甚者美國代表匪特置身伊朗陸軍，且參加伊朗其他機關，尤其是伊朗航空公司之民用飛機隊管理機構，此固號稱伊朗國有之航空公司，然其主要位置悉爲美國官員所佔據。預　不久將更有大批美國官兵開到伊朗。眞理報記者又謂，蘇聯軍會所舉之事實，並證明美駐伊照事團之活動，得以造成對蘇聯邊　之危險，例如在美軍官指導下，伊北沿蘇聯邊界一帶正興筆要塞工事。最近美顧問不時由陸空兩路經過與蘇毗鄰之區域，雖以視察伊軍及憲兵爲名，實則攝取蘇邊界之照片，並作軍事硏究。蘇照會指出以上種種事實，均與促進蘇伊善鄰關係之原則不符，因此蘇聯政府請伊朗政府迅速採取必要措施，以消滅正在製造中的惡劣局勢。</p>
<h3>伊擬續向美貸款　用以購武器</h3>
<p>〔路透社德里蘭二日電〕伊朗陸長畢奈元帥向國會提出法案，要求授權政府向美聲請貸款一千萬元，向美購買伊朗陸軍所需之軍器彈藥。該案已由國會交國會特委會硏究。按去歲六月美國已貸給伊政府二千五百萬元，購置美國剩餘物資巾之軍　　備及軍服，大部份均係用以購買配備，僅小部份作爲購買軍器之用。</p>
<h3>義大利普選　定四月舉行</h3>
<p>制憲會議任務完成　〔法國新聞社羅馬二電〕本社記者今日獲悉星期四之政府會議中將擬定法令，規定義國在四月十八日舉行政治選舉，該法令並將決定參衆兩院同時集會之日期。按照新憲　法之規定，國會開會期必須在大選後二十天以內，故政界人士相信該日期或將定於五月八日，蓋此為義國第一次國會成立之百週年也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬一日電〕義大利制憲會議之任務今日已告終止。該制憲會議須由總統總理及三分之一以上之議員連名要求，始能召開。按此會議在一九四六年七月二日選舉成立，其最後討論之案件爲西西里之自主問題，此案已在極大多數贊成下通過。</p>
<h3>德境蘇軍政府　實施改革計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕與蘇軍總部有密切接觸之德國人士，預料德境蘇軍政府首要人物不久將有大規模更動，軍事人員將逐漸以非軍人代替，此項計劃已開始袘。蘇當局從未宣布此項改革。據云，係於去秋蘇聯內閣副總理貝里亞來德以後，即着手實施改革。共目的有二：　逐漸以非軍人蘇軍政府之軍人，俾與德官員及政治家樹立更滿意的關係；　加強蘇聯共黨在德境蘇軍政府內之勢力。</p>
<h3>眞理報指責美國　擴增國防費</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦二日合衆電〕算聯共黨眞理報載稱，一九四八年蘇聯預算中之國防經費業已减少，美國預算中之國防費則已增多。據稱，此種對比，可以表示何國希望和平，何國「計劃新的侵略」。眞理報所載文字，係由莫斯科電台向外廣播，內稱，蘇聯預算中之國防費，自百分之十八。四减爲百分之十七，美國總預算中則爲百分之卅，用以擴充武力，而「實際之費川遠較此數爲巨」云。</p>
<h3>美艦訪問義海港　美拒蘇抗議　美義新商約簽字</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二日廣播：美艦隊訪問義大利各海港，蘇聯提出抗議，美政府今日正式予以拒絕。美方致蘇聯之照會，謂美艦訪問義大利，事先獲得義當局之核准。</p>
<p>又電：美義兩國今日簽訂新商約，代替兩國在一八七一年所締結之友好貿易及航海協定。</p>
<p>又電：英美法蘇四國外長代表今在倫敦繼續討論義殖民地未來地位問題。</p>
<h3>巴基斯坦外長　在美讚譽甘地</h3>
<p>〔聯合社芝加哥一日電〕巴基斯坦外長柴發魯拉今日在芝加哥大學廣播座談會發表演說稱，「甘地遇害後，印度命運如何殊難逆料。暗殺甘地乃甘地終身致力團結之人民間發生暴動之信號。渠一生目的在求完全蹬明其爭取印度政治自由之方法正確無誤」。</p>
<h3>應付未來原子戰爭　美擬就防禦計劃</h3>
<p>南太平洋英美軍演習假想戰</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕國防部長福萊斯特擬在不久宣佈全國性永久民間防禦原子與化學等戰爭之計劃。此計劃可能包括如何普遍應用雷達，如何防止大炎之蔓延，如何撤退受傷人民以及大工業區之應否分散導問題。然此種行動所費實不貲也。</p>
<p>〔合眾社雪梨二日電〕美海軍第卅八機動隊近至雪梨作五日訪問，定於四日淸晨在新南威爾斯海岸與皇家澳洲海軍隊以及皇家空軍隊舉行假想演習戰。</p>
<h3>美國減稅案　兩黨意見不同</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕美衆院議員二日將對美國大小納稅人减稅六百五十萬美元一案，舉行表決，但參議院可能覓取另一途徑，主張較節省之方案。據衆院共和黨領袖預測，共和黨衆議員稅則委會主席在該會中所提出之選舉年普遍减稅案，可能得二對之一之大多數。按納遜之法案，個人免稅，增加百元，並减稅百分之十五至三十。民主黨爲打消共和黨計劃，將要求衆院將法案送回稅則委會重新起草。</p>

<h3>北美報業聯合會版權所有</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譁</p>
<p>卅年代的一個凶事預言者</p>
<p>在羅斯福政府的最初幾年中，德國正在武裝，日本正在從事戰爭，義大利在準備衝突，常時最不幸的一點，無堝於西方三大民主國家—美國，英國和法國之間的許多爭論，致使它們的關係蒙受不良影響。在我一進國務院之後，我立即發覺唯有上述三國採取相同的立塲，才能使這三個好戰國家恢復理性，蘇聯倘能參加在我們一起，常然更好。但是實際上，我們之間的不協議和歧視，時常多於協調，呈現出一片悽慘景象。</p>
<p>在我們的對英關係中，西門外相時當是煩惱的根源。自從日本侵略滿洲時起，我似乎總覺得西門缺乏一種堅定的基本主張。根據一切得到的消息，我相信他替日木人考慮得太周到；我至今還這樣想。常總統在受任之後立即決定重建我國海軍，使它的實力達到條約所限定的程度時，西門要求我們放棄這個計劃，深恐它引起海軍的軍備競爭，但是他並不提出放棄建造當時正在動工的英國軍艦·在倫敦經濟會議中，西門是不合作的。他個性冷峻。</p>
<p>一九三五年三月間，西門對國際實地檢査軍火生產的原則表示反對，此點使總統極爲震怒。我　　　同意這個原則，羅斯　　　　意見一致。我把威爾遜公使於三月八日從日內瓦發來的一個電報送給總統，其中列舉了西門所以反對的三點理由：撿査將使英國軍備的危急情形，　　　大陸各國知道；假如英　　意了，它們勢將對法國人放棄他們的「王牌」，因爲法國人並無向該方面更向前走一步以謀成立限制軍備條約的意向；將軍火定單詳細公佈將給不公允的競爭提供一個基礎，而使英國的軍火工業蒙受不利。</p>
<p>翌日，三月九日，總統在給我的一個短簡中表示意見，認爲這是「極重要的一個電報。我想你應該留置一旁，將來可能有用。」他繼續說：「這個電報說明了兩點：第一，以傳說中的軍備薄弱爲理由，英國不願意接受國際公開檢査軍備的原則，因此，使我們認爲必要的一着—就是把這個原則適用於德國這一點—也無法進行。換言之，使德國軍備維持在一個相互同意的水準之下的唯一切實辦法就是檢査德國的軍火供應，英國本身拒絕檢査，無異粉碎了道個希望。電報中最後一節，乃是公開承認英國所以拒絕接受詳細公開軍火定單的理由，是爲了它會使他們的軍火工業蒙受不利。」</p>
<p>於是他總結一下說：「將來到一個時光，或許可以把眞相宣佈出來，證明現在的英國政府對於限制或縮减現行世界軍備或現行世界軍火貿易，並無誠意。</p>
<p>「我感到懊喪」。</p>
<p>在華盛頓，當時的英國大使林特賽（Sir　Ronald　Lindsay）是難應付的。他和美國人的接觸，僅限於少數極高等社會人士，他們大部份是反對羅斯福政府的。我們極難使他明瞭我們的觀點。我和他更有能力和更可親的繼任者洛齊安和哈里法克斯，相處得好得多。</p>
<p>應付英法的主要困難之一，就是它們互相之間沒有好自應付的能力。</p>
<p>英法之間的爭執，肇始於巴黎和會。法國希望把它的軍略國境移至萊因河。它放棄了這種意向，用以交換英美公約，給予保障，但是這種公約從來沒有具體化。從那時候起，法國覺得英美一方面在依賴它抵擋德國，而同時又要求它削减實行這種防衛用的陸軍。英國希望一個更强有力的繁榮的德國。法國希望德國的實力在它之下。鑒於德國優越的工業實力以及對任何德國政府的不信任（不論其成份如何），法國對於使它自己和德國的軍備接近平等的任何辦法，不能同意。在另一方面，英國不喜歡法國在大陸上佔有一個高踞雄視的地位，更希望歐洲造成一種均勢，而使它自己的實力可以成爲決定的因素，舉足輕重。但是，法國雖然堅決反對英國對於大陸的觀念，是不斷地企求和英國成立一個銅澆鐵鑄的安全公約，以防德國。</p>
<p>許多人將不斷提出的問題之一，乃是當時英法的實力旣如此之優越而德國的實力又如此之處於頹勢，那麽爲什麼它們會允許德國獲得優勢而威脅它們自己的生存呢？此中道理，就是英法兩國都不想採取防止戰爭的措置。在英國，孤立主義的情緖，差不多和在美國一樣强。法國在一九二三年侵入魯爾區的時候，是想當試過預防措施的。結果引起了英國的激烈反對，而使波盎卡萊（Poincare）倒台。從此以後，沒有一個法國政府願意再從事於防預戰爭了。</p>
<p>這裏，我們面對着民主國家的一個基本弱點，也就是人民具有重要發言權的政府所免不了的一個基本弱點。它們在許冬許多方面固然享有上帝一切豐裕的祝福，但最不幸的是當它們而臨國外的危險時，不論是即將發生或者已經形成嚴重威脅的，一向行動很慢！簡直太慢。純粹的民主政治是雅典人對文明的貢獻，但是這個小國在而臨來自國外的某種威脅時，還要舉行公民投票來決定雅典是　　該作戰。這種缺乏領導以反對適當政府官吏的能力缺乏信任，結果使他們自己落入無法無天的侵略者之手中，後者的目的無非是要俘虜和奴役雅典人。這種弱點，導致雅典民主政洽的瓦解和最後毁滅。</p>
<p>假如在一九三〇年代，我們一方面能够對於這裏以及其他愛好和平國家的個人和團體的各種矛盾意見予以適當的尊重，而同時爭取和平各國又能採取一致行動實行適當的武裝，我確信它們可以要求和德義日這輩盜匪國家攤牌，因而避免掉最近這一次世界大戰的。</p>
<p>我們一方面努力改善對英國和法國的直接關係，以謀增進歐洲的和平機會，同時我們也不斷設法增强國際聯盟的威信，兼收並蓄，不謀而合。總統和我，都是威爾遜的信徒，對於國際聯盟，始終寳愛。自從一九二〇年以來，我們倆人曾屢次努力嘗試，企圖以勸導的方法和實際的行動來維護國聯，使它發展充份的力量，惟無結果。</p>
<p>有一次，總統對我說，他想到任命一個美國大使留駐於國聯的可能性。但在這方面，障礙渦多。沒有別的非會員國家派有這樣的一個代表；我國對國聯的各種任務，正由我國駐瑞士公使充份予以執行。此外，國內的孤立主義者一定會借題發揮，拼命來攻擊政府的。</p>
<p>歐洲和亞洲方面，對於和平的威歷代氣燄萬丈，但是在美國引起的反應，恰與情理相反。照事理講，這種威脅應該使美國民衆中的一大部份更願意和國外思想正直的國家團結，向顯在準備戰爭的國家施用壓力。但在事實上，它們却使這些美國人慌張退縮，誓不和世界其餘部份的事情，發生關係。他們中間大多數人的信念是忠實的，但是懵懂地沒有看到一點，就是任何一處發生了一個重大的戰爭，是不能不在許多重要方面影響我們的。</p>
<p>我自己以及和我合作的許多其他官吏，不斷向我們的國人以及外國政府指出，就是破壞和平的危險已經很大，並且還在擴大巾。甚至在今天，還有許多人顯露着驚奇的神色，完全不明瞭或者忘懷了過去似的，高聲向當時我們中直接負責外交工作的人說：「一九三三年後的幾年中你們在做些什騰？你們爲什麽不發覺正在國外不斷滋長的危險？你們爲什麽不把這種危險以及奮起準備的需要通知美國大衆？假如孤立主義的觀點大大地妨礙了去發現以及使美國明瞭這種危險和威脅，那麼你們爲什麽不把這個異常重要的問題促使大衆注意？」</p>
<p>對於這些　屬天眞的問題和呌囂，已往的記錄提供了充份的答覆。當侵略的危險日益成爲明顯時，單在我任職國務院的最初二年中，我就發表二十次以上的演說和聲明，其中以英語所能表達的一切方法，提出强有力的警吿，關　危險的日益迫近。</p>
<p>我在其後幾年中繼續提出這種警告。我在準備這種公開演說時一直是很注意的。我知道它們一定會被國內廣泛引證，而外國政府大致也會把全文閱讀一過。它們不僅是表示我自己的觀點，而是表示美國政府的政策和觀點的。</p>
<p>有時候，爲了寫一篇演說要費上幾個星期。我會把一羣重要的顧問呌到我的辦公室來·我會對他們說：「我預定於某某日在某甘城發表一篇演說，我心裏想到的如此。」於是我就把腦筋中形成的觀念，說一個輪廓給他們聽。我的而前可能有幾頁摘記，是在上一夜某一時光在公寓由寫的。其次我要他們提出意見和建議。最後我就在同事中挑選一人，呌他把這些意見草就一篇演說。一個重要部院的首長簡直天天要發表各色各樣的重要聲明，事實上的確沒有時間來草擬原稿了。</p>
<p>當演說的初稿送來之後，我就加以修改和重寫。於是我就把這份稿子分發給我的顧問，請他們把建議和附加的意思寫上去。</p>
<p>有一篇重要演說前後曾寫過十五篇初稿，然後我給它一個爲後的「O.K.」</p>
<p>在我發表一篇有關政府某種政策的重要演說之前，我總先把原稿送給總統看過，信守不易。我常常親自送給他，一則因爲在他沒有讀過以前，我不願它落入他人之手，一則在他閱讀之時我希望親自在旁，以便隨時有說明機會，並且可以目睹他的反應如何。總統靜靜地讀我的演說，但是在他發現特別引起他興趣的東西時，時常會發表意見。但是地提出建議或批評的情形極少，縱使有，也並非屬於根本性質的。</p>
<p>除了這些演說之外，我繼續用相同的語氣私下和大國的大使們談話。</p>
<p>人家固然聽我，但是不加注意。在二十年代，我在國會中一向是一個凶事的預言者，不意在三十年代，竟在外交方面重演。</p>
<h3>治理印度自治領政策　印政府將發文告　尼赫魯演說決制止暴力</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里二止電〕印度政府不日將發表文吿，宣布其治理印度自治領之政策，政府業於其前此之深得民心，泰半由於其政策與卄地之意見適相吻合之故，今卄地旣已遇害，自有發表文吿聲明其政策之必要。</p>

<h3>申新九廠罷工衝突流血　官警工人死傷七十七名</h3>
<p>政軍警當局聯合招待記者報告經過</p>
<p>再有類此情事發生格殺勿論</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西澳門路申新第九紗廠工人六千餘人，因向廠方提出要求九項未遂，於卅日中午十二時四十分突然開始罷工，並拒絕推派代表談判，同時並將廠房內外　門緊閉，迄至昨日下午二時，本市黨政機關首長用擴大器向工人勸導復工無效。警員擬進內施行彈壓時，大批工人忽用機器零件及磚石自高樓擲下，致發生重大衝突。旋經軍警用催淚彈及槍械向內進擊，先後達半小時，始得入內，壓平紛擾。事後調査死女工三人，傷男女工人卅八人，同時官警亦有卅六名受傷。當塲並扣押肇事嫌疑犯百餘人，除七十五名待究外，其餘工人在晚十一時前，業已全部釋放。</p>
<p>當晚十時，吳市長抱病在寓邸招待中外記者發表談話，並由社會局長吳開先，警察局長俞叔平，警備司令宣鐵吾先後報吿經渦情形，宜司令並堅決表示，嗣後如再遇有此類情事，當命軍警格殺勿論。吳市長昨晚出席招待會時，體力尙未復原，且腰部傷處仍疼痛不已，故家人特在其椅背置　子兩隻，市長致詞時，兩手不時按住腰部，但發言仍堅强有力。渠對申新一事，認爲此種行動決非普通工人所爲，顯係暴徒有計劃之陰謀。今後政府爲保障五百萬市民之安居樂業，如再遇有類似情事，決當塲格殺勿論。潘議長代表全上海五百萬市民，要求政府立即頒佈戒嚴令，以保障生命財產之安全。吳市長當表示接受，並謂必要時定必會同宣司令請求中央宣布上海爲戒嚴區域。</p>
<p>罷工於三十日下午十二時四十分開始，九廠工人共有六千餘名，百分之九十爲女工。原分早夜兩班，是日早班工人本應於下午五時半離廠，但屆時均留聚不出，夜班工人本應於晚上八時半上工，但是日至七時左右，即紛紛吵鬧要求上工，廠方爲免生事端，乃准予進內，於是早夜兩班工人，遂在廠房內聚合，至卅一日淸晨二時，推出代表兩百人，與廠方開始談判，因人數過多，說話毫無秩序，廠方乃請工人代表中另推五人負責發言，當時提出七項條件：　每人借工資兩月，　十一月十二日所扣工資應照本月份指數補發（按該日所扣工資係爲建築總工會會所），　年賞問題在上年發之六成照十二月份指數，本年四成照一月份指數發給，　女工生產期不加限制，並不得將工號調動，　配給物品應不論身份證有否限期一次補發。　每月發給米二斗，代辦米四斗仍應照發，　嗣後廠方管制工友辦法，得由勞資雙方協議。此項條件廠方表示除配給煤球已在辦理外，餘均無法接受，談判無結果而散。全體工人乃留居廠房，直至昨日，已達三日之久。在此期內，社會局方面雖派調解科朱圭林顧力軍及工人福利委負會何健等全力調解，但工人態度甚爲堅强，於七項條件之外復增加　每星期內放假一天工資照給，　去年一月份後開除之工友應予復工等兩項。朱等調解毫無結果，且反被目爲資方「走狗」，情勢逐漸惡化。三十一日普陀警分局副分局長黃朝賓率便衣警兩人進內調解，被工人軟禁一日。</p>
<p>發現煽動標語</p>
<p>同時在申新九廠附近各廠牆上發現煽動性標語，如「歡迎大學生協助」，「全瞠紗廠一致行動」，「滬東區工廠亦已罷工」等等。更有一部份工人，至九廠隔鄰之統益紗廠門口呌喊，並抛擲石塊，煽動參加罷工。至昨日淸晨六時，當局以工人羣中份予複雜，乃派該管普　路警分局及摩托車隊大隊警士前往工廠營戒，工人見警察到來，事先已退入第三道鐵柵門以內，將鐵門禁閉。警察到達後，勸導工人推派代表進行談判，但工人置之不理，形成僵持狀態。迄至中午，警備部警備大隊亦奉令派來協助，警察局長兪叔平警備部稽査處長陶一珊均親自趕至，與社會局代表顧力軍，總工會代表章祝三，工人福利會代表陸蔭初，范才騤等先後以擴　機向工人廣播，勸導工人推派代表，商討合理解決辦法，但工人羣仍毫無表示，反在屋頂預置大量磚石木棍鐵器硝　水等物，進備防阻警員入內。如此僵持至下午四時三十分，工人羣中分裂爲兩派，一部份工人表示願責推派代表出外談判，警察等乃即設法將門鎖撬開以便使代表外出，不料工塲內另一部份工人騷動呼喊，表示反對。</p>
<p>居高臨下攻擊軍警</p>
<p>此時工塲及飯廳屋頂上即有大量磚石鐵棍及硝　水等擲下，一時碎片亂飛，秩序大亂，警備大隊第二中隊長嚴滋及普陀分局警察四名被工人拖進工房，將佩槍奪去，並拳打脚踢，均受重傷，後經其他警員冒險衝入救出。此時有一部份不願受脅從之工人約四十餘名即乘機逃出，另有領導肇事之工人代表十八名，爲警員拘獲拖出。混亂中工塲屋頂上之工人繼續以鐵條木塊硝　水機器零件向下投擲，並用自來水管澆射，警員等乃略向後退，一面急電總部加派保安警察裝甲車隊飛行堡壘刑事警察等到塲協助。</p>
<h3>鎭壓暴行命令開槍　探光燈下大隊進攻</h3>
<p>五時三刻，宣司令劉塲，警察局長俞叔平，稽查處長陶一珊伴同宣司令步行至停放於第二道鐵門之警備車旁，並報吿工人佔據屋頂，澆　　水，投擲磚石鐵器等詳情，其時摩托車隊警士，擬藉小型裝甲車之掩護，屋頂工人見警察有所行動，立即抗阻，磚石，木棍，圓型鐵桶及長板凳等紛紛飛來，同時又暗射　水，警士無法前進，祗得仍舊退回原處，宣司令睹狀大爲震怒，對俞局長稱：「在此局面下，惟有開槍，如有抗拒者，格殺不論，一切由我負責」。並指示：先施放催淚彈，逼迫工人後退，然後衝入佔據屋頂，設法包圍。</p>
<p>兪局長奉命，即召集保警大隊，與摩托車隊，準備攻擊，所有員警咸右手持棍，左手握槍，兪局長叮囑，非至生命危險時不得開槍，準備旣畢，一年老警士以催淚彈十餘枚連緻向屋頂射擊，頃刻烟霧瀰漫，人影幢幢，步槍聲大作，警士齊聲喊衝，藉警備車上探照燈光，向前衝擊，攻入正對大門之棧房間，俞局長命身旁之號警吹衝鋒號指揮，一部份警員已由正修建中之餐廳外木匠所搭之梯架攀登屋頂，止住工人投擲磚石，其時槍聲，號聲，與吶喊聲，交織成一片。</p>
<p>縱火未成</p>
<p>廠內工人見警士以笛　萬鈞之力進入，知難頑抗，紛紛向後逃避，少數歹徒擬縱火焚廠，幸消防車及時趕到，配合攻擊，奸計未售。至六時半，初度攻擊已告一段落，餐廳及棧房屋頂已為警察控制。宣司令見警察已衝入，即匆匆離去，臨行向負責指揮人員指示謂：「衝入設法使工人集中，然後包圍搜索再設法處置」。六時卅七分衝鋒號又起，槍聲密集，兪局長親自指揮，再度展開衝擊，嗣保警增援部隊趕到，警察已佔絕對優勢，警備車隨先鋒隊步步逼近，强光燈照射處已無工人蹤跡，惟吶喊之聲仍從後進廠房內傳來，不時據報，全廠已　在警察控制中，時爲六時五十四分。</p>
<p>局長訓話</p>
<p>大部份工人均係良善而受少數人利用，經此一塲混戰，均警惶莫名，年老女工　觫不能步行，有跪地哀求者，有雙手蒙面呌號呼寃者，均稱被迫參加罷工，對向炎方提出條件亦毫不知情，警察爲搜尋被奪去之槍支，命男女工人高舉雙手，排成單人行列，魚貫而出，逐一經過檢査，押赴工塲前之大草地，由兪局要訓話，中有若干以磚石投擲警察者，搶奪搶械者，破壞機器者，企圖縱火者，被出後立加拘押者甚衆。俞局長之訓話略謂：「我們今天的槍是朝天開的，所以沒有打死一個人。你們每月有三百多萬元的薪津，比我局長　的待遇高一半，還要鬧事闖下大禍，你們用暴力反抗政府，毆打警察，這種行爲完全是暴徒，但是今天我祗辦爲首的人，你們全可以回家了（工人歡呼謝局長）。希望以後要顧到資方的困難，本勞資合作精神，不要再受人利用，好好地工作」。兪局長訓話畢，開始逐一檢查，直至十一時全部釋放完畢。同時警察分別至各車間，棧間等處，搜出企圖匿藏之男女工人不少，惟被奪去之手槍五支，始終未曾發現。</p>
<p>宣司令於八時許再度到廠，親自赴各處巡視，並飭該廠何廠長調查損失情形。</p>
<p>檢騐三女屍</p>
<p>十一時後，地撿處陳壽陶丁同峻二檢察官，偕法醫龔自爲蒞申新勘察並驗三女屍，死者一名王華美，係申新九廠小包間女工，因混亂中被羣衆擠軋，窒息致死，另一名朱雲仙，係在高處奔跑時失足跌斃，另一係槍傷致死，惟迄深夜尙無法查出其姓名。</p>
<h3>紗廠股市價　受影響低落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日股市，因申新九廠工潮醞釀不決，且有惡化趨勢，一般持有紗廠股者，有感於紗廠前途之危機，紛紛脫售，紗廠股籌碼，遂形泛濫，上午永紗一度見六六〇元低價，下午收盤前，始因銀根轉鬆，略見起色。</p>
<h3>吳市長官邸舉行中外記者招待會　各首長出席報告經過　潘議長要求　宣佈戒嚴令</h3>
<p>申新事件發生後，當晚十時，吳市長即抱病在寓邸召集中外各報記者發表談話，並由社會局長吳開先，警察局長兪叔平，宣司令鐵吾，先後報吿經過，市參議會潘議長亦發表意見，出席招待會者尙有各報社社長，總編輯，方主委，陶一珊，陸京士，申新九廠廠長曁有關各局處長等共約六十人。談話至十一時半始畢。會後，市長仍與潘議長，宣司令等舉行會議，討論關於今後治安問題。</p>
<h3>社局職員曾被扣　確知為共黨鼓動</h3>
<p>招待會首由社會局長吳開先報吿工潮起始原因及演變經過，該廠工潮係自三十日開始，工人突然組織料察隊逼迫全廠工人停止工作，並斷絕內外交通，但事前並無任何條件向資方提出。事後社會局派職員朱圭林前往調停，被工人扣留關在廠內二十四小時之久。廠長亦被關三天，廠內工人非經糾察隊許可不能外出。事後工人所提出之七項要求，其中有甚多與法令抵觸，廠方確無法接受，政府亦不能予以承認。去年十一月時，政府即獲得情報，共黨已有命令發動上海年關鬥爭，以年賞問題作爲工具。政府知此企岡，即以很快方法解決各工廠年賞問題，至今已有百分之九十以上獲得解決。共黨知陽曆年底年賞鬥爭失敗，乃發動陰曆年底借薪鬥爭。申新九廠之陰曆年底借薪運動，確知即係共黨鼓動。一日情勢嚴重時，知非普通勞資糾紛，即經報吿吳市長，非請警局協助解決不可。</p>
<h3>預定步驟　卒用武力</h3>
<p>繼由警察局長兪叔平報告暴動經過，聲稱該廠七千餘工人中十分之九爲女工，其餘十分之一爲男工。大部工人昔爲不願參加者。日有甚多女工在廠內痛哭。軍警於處置該一事件前，商討決定三項步驟，第一步先由各機關代表廣播勸導。第二步由各機關代表進入末道門勸解。如以上兩項步驟皆行不通則設法以武力佔住進入末道大門。　佔據末道門後，再廣播勸導願出外之工作准予出廠。步驟決定後，乃逐步實施。經勸導不聽，僵持一二小時後，工人首先要求軍警撤退至大門，始派出二代表至末道門，並同意剪開門鍊。當剪開門鍊後，工人代表走出之一刹那，預伏屋頂之工人或有誤會，以爲軍警將代表逮捕，乃將預置之木棍，磚頭，玻璃碎片，硝鏹水，鐵椎，油筒等物紛紛擲下，衝突於焉開始。因工人佔據高棋擲下硝鏹水等各物，部隊無法前進。後宣司令趕到，覺不能再理喩，乃決定派部隊佔據高屋，並擬以極輕微武器控制羣眾。並因暴徒佔據屋頂，爲求驅散，乃令警察向天開槍咸嚇，並以催淚彈彈壓在地面鼓噪之工人，以裝甲軍前衝開入。始吿壓住。衝突中警察受傷三十餘人，重傷三人。工人則有三名致死，其中二人因在內三四天內無吃被擠悶致死，另一人頭部有血，正由法醫檢騐。工人另受傷三十餘人，重傷五人。</p>
<p>司令表示除暴決心</p>
<p>宣司令繼兪局長後亦報吿昨日處理此事經過。最後並堅決宣布「以後如再有類似事件發生，即以最嚴厲方法對付，必要時當命令軍警開槍制止，格殺勿論。」宣氏表示昨日此事發生，軍警方面再三用和平方法求得解決，然終為工人拒絕，實無理可喻。又謂：上海近五天來，先後發生不幸事件多次，對於社會秩序殊堪憂慮，每次事件發生，常局雖以和平方法處理，奈好亂者太多，暴動無法避免。故今日之事若不解決，可能蔓延至其他工廠，則上海將成無法收拾之局面。本八負治安主要責任，決不容許少數暴徒破壞五百萬市民之安全。</p>
<p>人民有權要求政府保障</p>
<p>潘議長表示：本人站在參談會立塲，認爲今夫社會局與警察局處理申新事件是應該如此的。尤其宣司令所宣佈今後之方針亦爲必應採取者。日前吳市長被同濟大學學生毆辱，但其仍萬分忍耐命令不准開槍，市長爲愛獲學生，亦應該出此。但本人當時即祖憂，一個普通市民，違反法令，毆辱市長，此種情形若不嚴厲制止，是極危險的。果然次日即有社會局被搗毁情事發生，當時本人親自在塲，並未見有派代表前來商談。而今日之事，更可看出暴徒騷亂情形。如此下去，上海市民如何能安居樂業？所以今後必須用嚴厲辦法制止，對宣司令宣佈之警吿，吾絕對贊成。</p>
<p>議長復稱，政府若再不下決心維持地方安寗，則不僅上海如此，其他各地亦將發生不安。上海爲國際都市，經濟中心，中國第一口岸，共匪用種種方法來破壞，政府如何不在此宣佈戒嚴。我們有權要求政府保障，在此種情形下，若仍不許開槍，則軍警何用？此實爲一種錯誤，此種錯誤，決不能再繼續存在。我們要請市長，宣司令，向中央請示宣佈上海是一戒嚴城市。</p>
<h3>海浙輪抵埠　日賠償物資　正開艙起卸　裝來機件六八一箱</h3>

<h3>三大事互有關聯　顯屬有計劃陰謀</h3>
<p>希望市民千萬勿受共黨利用</p>
<p>最後吳市長扶病起立致詞，認爲政府有二項任務，其一爲愛護善良民衆，使能安居樂業，另一爲剷除暴力份子，不使危害民衆，簡言之即除暴安良。最近上海市於五天內連出三事，上月廿九日本人於學潮中被毆辱，三十一日社會局被搗毁，今日又發生工潮。此三事表面上看來並不相關，而實際則互有關聯。最近共產黨組織「全國騷亂運動委員會」，以周恩來任主席，長江流域設有指揮機構，上海當然爲其集中目標。同濟學潮中，本人可保證多數學生係被利用，少數則受共黨指示，故意欲逼使政府開槍，此項目的未能達到，乃繼續有打社會局鬧工潮之事發生。本人自己可被打，但不願無故開槍使無辜市民受害。社會局如此搗毀，本人與宣司令仍主儘量避免流血。在同濟學潮被毆辱後，本人曾接獲甚多市民來信，主張再發生此類事件時，以開槍彈壓。今日申新工潮，工人揮酒硝鏹水，並將機器拆下，與石塊鐵筒等同作為丟擲之武器，此種行動，不能視作普通工人，顯屬暴徒有計劃之陰謀，對暴徒祗能施用武力。政府已忍無可忍，故本人完全贊同宣司令之意見，警告上海市善良民衆，千萬勿受共黨利用。將來如再有發生同樣事情，定必當塲格殺。政府爲保障五百萬市民安居樂業，不能不使用武力。現警告在先，以後如遇暴動時，軍警再有開槍，政府不負責任。希市民瞭解政府容忍之苦衷，贊同此項意見。潘議長代表五百萬市民之意見，本人完全接受。必要時一定會同宣司令請求中央宣佈上海臨時戒嚴。</p>

<h3>華中運輸總站·江湖聯絡樞紐　城陵磯港展望</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙一日訊〕城陵磯，距岳陽東北八公里，在洞庭湖東岸的一個港口。分佈了湖南全省的湘·資·沅·灃四水，都流注於洞庭湖中，城陵磯是湖南貨物的呑吐口。那威又是　长江合流的地方，長江上流的四川·鄂西·黔北等地，　是該港的腹地。那裏扼江湖交通的樞紐，上游流域面積有六十七萬除方公里，物產有米·茶·桐油·藥材，礦產等，均頗豐富。所以城陵磯是湖南理想中的內河良港。現今粵漢路已經暢通，若能自城陵磯築一條六公里長的鐵路和粤漢路相接，則那廣大腹地的物產，却可以經該港直達廣州，輸出外洋，省時省費。過去城陵磯的船埠，在桂花圍，規模甚小，復因頻年泥沙淤　，遂使這許多的貨物，不得不經過武漢運　上海，有一千五百餘公里的水程。而在武漢有重行裝卸之煩，上海港口也有吐納不暢之感。所以城陵磯的建港，對於腹地經濟之開發，關係至巨。</p>
<p>計劃闢港埠</p>
<p>湘省府鑒於城陵磯的重要，現正計劃闢爲港埠，聘李榮夢爲工程師，草擬修築計劃。擬定工程分兩期進行：第一期就城陵磯北端劉公廟和述花塘之間，修建護岸碼頭及機橋兩座，先資利用。第二期再在城陵磯南端桂花園和七里山之間，建泊船塢三座，均附有複式船閘。自江岸起加舖鐵路六公里連接粤漢路城陵磯車站，並修築通達岳陽縣城的公路八公里。在長江深水綫　城陵磯間，裝置起卸設備，並建貨棧倉庫以供應用。鄰近則闢爲工業區商業區·住宅區，則加工製造，貿易經營，均可隨之發展，而學校·醫院·住宅·道路等市政建設，亦可隨意規劃。</p>
<p>照上述計劃，工料佔計，按戰前幣値，需一百十五萬五千元。現湘省府擬即開工興建，工款籌措方法，除鐵路公路分別由粤漢路局和省公路局辦理外，庫房·躉船·起重機等則招商承辦，其他工程則舉債修建。預計工程完成後，可有兩百萬噸的吐納量，按戰前幣値每噸以五十元計，每年進山口貨物總値約一億元，港口各項費用抽百分之一，即有一百萬元，除管理費用外，投資本利用於兩年內全部償淸。</p>
<p>在城陵磯港築成以後，長江上游及湘·資·沅·灃四水流經地區的貨物可由城院磯轉粤漢路出口。城陵磯至上海的水程有一千五百公里，而至廣州的陸程，祗有八百公里，築港後可以减縮運程百分之四十七，時間也可從七天减爲五天。運輸費川：現由城陵磯經漢口至上海，每噸需運費一百二十二萬元，岳陽至廣州之運實每噸僅五十七萬元，故城陵磯港埠完成後，可節省運費百分之五十三。</p>
<p>粤漢路原是長江以南的一條南北六動脈，粤省府對於黃埔港的開　，也在積極進行中。將來黃埔港的發展，必需賴與漢路沿綫經濟的開發，纔有大量的貨物可　運輸呑吐。就粤漢路沿綫而論，長沙衝陽等地，固朱始不宜築港，然瀕年來湘水及洞庭湖泥沙淤積，不能和長江主要航道相銜接。只有城陵磯位於江湖匯流之處，距粤漢路最近，地高水深，具有聯絡水陸運輸之便利。</p>
<p>湖廣熟，天下足，湘省實爲物產富庶之區，圖以運　關係，棄貨於地，殊爲可惜。一旦城陵磯港埠完成，長江與粤漢路兩條，水陵運輸路綫，得以溝通。水漢時，一千噸的汽船，可直達宜昌，五百噸之船，可以上溯重慶。若順流而下，則一萬噸的船，可以駛抵京滬。再將沅資兩水，加以疏濬，使二百噸至五百噸之船，暢行無阻，則可以南及桂北，西迄黔境。行見輪航　湊，百貨　集，均有待城陵磯港以資　運　現今城陵磯築港工程，尙在籌備中，巳透露了偉大美麗的遼景。待這想像一且成爲事實，不僅岳陽一邑之利，湖南一省之益，鄂西，桂北，黔北，四川，甚至西康東部的人民，都叨不少的光；同時華中的經濟情勢，必另有一番新氣象。（羅森）</p>

<h3>浙南菰民　度着候鳥生活</h3>
<p>〔本報能泉一日訊〕香菰，是素食中的上品，味道鮮美，即雞鴨魚肉，亦有不及。因此香菰的銷路，遍及國內外，聞抗戰勝利之初，美軍在上海嚐到香菰，頓感香澈心脾，口齒間油膩爲之洗淨，竟認爲是世間無上的妙品。於是競向市上購買，帶往美國餽贈親友，致當時菰價暴漲，菰民獲利數倍。菰類有野生於</p>
<p>腐草樹皮　之上，得菰則須用斧砍裂樹皮方能生殖，和遍地野生的蔴菰種植法不同。同一香菰，品質高下極爲懸殊，價格亦不一。花菰爲菰中的上品，蓋上呈白色花紋，是因雪後驟晴，菰蓋爲陽光晒裂所致。次爲厚菰，質厚而形小，因大寒久晴，菰蓋不易展開。如遇連朝陰雨，菰蓋放大而質薄，稱爲薄菰，爲香菰中最次的。菰的優劣，完全繫於天時，故菰民若得花菰，視爲天賜之福，非人力可謀。</p>
<p>種菰須先選樹，可以種菰的樹，如櫧，榧，栗，冬靑，橄欖，杜松等，不下二百餘種。這種樹木，都產於深山窮谷之間，以閩省爲最多，贛，湘，粤，桂諸省亦有出產。菰樹雖產於閩，贛，粤，桂各地，但種菰的人，却是浙南人民的專業。因爲做菰樹的方法，菰民向來嚴守秘密，外人無從獲悉，致成爲浙南菰民的專利。</p>
<p>浙南龍泉，景寗，慶元三縣，是菰民的大本營，共</p>
<p>十五萬人　舊曆十月到三月，是種菰的季節。每當黃葉飄零之時，常有一羣，鶉衣百結形容枯槁的人，男女老幼，負包携藍，沿着龍慶公路上走去，這就是出發去菰山的菰民。他們每年冬去春返，習以爲常，在等山寒嶺中操作，生活至苦。在他們的腦海中，祗是憧憬着雪堆中透露出來的一堆花菰，便可成爲富翁。</p>
<p>菰民祗達山塲後，搭茅屋居住，即開始工作。將選定的樹砍倒，梢向下，根向上，去其椏枝，用斧在樹上鑒成瘡疤，各爲「做檣」。再將枝葉遮於樹上，稱做「遮衣」，以後即任憑日晒雨淋，風吹雪壓。到第二年冬天，看有否小菰生出，普通總要到第三年。</p>
<p>做檣得法　者，二年也會開花。花開後去其上蓋的枝葉，名謂「開衣」，以後三年中間，產菰最盛，呌做當旺。這時隨天氣而產厚薄大小不等的菰。過後樹皮腐爛，雖可用「催檣」的方法，—用薄板輕繫樹身，使之霍動—但產量終不多了。</p>
<p>這大羣的菰民，遍歷遼闊的地區，經營他們的菰業。菰民收菰之後，把他焙乾，分成等級，裝就布袋，運至菰行出售。菰行組織至為簡單，每年舊歷十月，老　和山客看定地點，開業經營。備有大批現金，付給菰民，並招待菰民食宿。在菰民靑黃不接之際，還放高利貸，預定本年產菰，售價菰民不得自主。</p>
<p>菰行盛衰　視老　的人情，菰民借款的信用，及過稱賣手等間題而定，甚至山主山客問的糾紛，或困難請託事項，對　行均有影響，所以菰行老　，均竭力迎合菰民，務使業務蒸蒸日上。</p>
<p>菰業，不僅是和菰民生活有關，對於浙南邊區的農村經濟，關係至鉅。近年來洋菰傾銷，致香　市塲呆滯，菰價慘跌，菰業已面臨餒重關頭。此因菰民秘守陳法，不知改進，以致產量日减，品質退化。若能採用科學方法，加以改進，未始不能挽救。</p>

<p>分區第塘　進行墾務。不久敵騎渡江進擾，餘姚旋遭淪陷，墾務也祗得中輟。去年夏，浙省墾務委員會，重提濬墾牟山湖之議，救濟總署浙省善後農棄委員會主席毛根博士，也兩度蒞該湖勘察，認爲極合理想，可以進行。至九月中旬，成立「牟山湖疏濬復墾委員會」，聘專家吳國昌爲主委，以牟山鄉鄕長孫錫年爲副。由聯總供給器材，利用最新農業機械濬墾。乃定於十月一日開工，發動牟山·開元·靑港等鄕農民一千六百人，從重築塘工程，即以聯總救濟麵粉賑工，又向餘姚水利協會借得穀二千祖以充徑費，工程遂開始進行。</p>
<p>築塘工程　定於十月底完成。迨開工以後，因天寒土堅，同時農民處理泥土又乏經驗，工作未能開展。於是濬墾會另招商承包。自雙十節開始，每天有工人二千餘，在牟山湖面，密集如蟻，埋首工作，卒於十月底如期完成，得湖田三千五百畝。太來即可進行開渠，旋因</p>
<p>經　周折　進行稍緩，須於今年春耕前，方可竣事。</p>
<p>濬墾十曾一面繼續從事於開渠。建閘等工程，一面辦理招嚴領耕登記手續。經營方式決定以自耕合作爲原則，用抽籤方式，分配與附近各鄕　及會對濬湖築堤工程有勞績的農民。所領的耕地，由縣府發給土地證，待各項工程費分期償淸後，土地產權即歸領耕者所有，惟規定不得轉租·轉賣或分割。縣府對領耕之土地，准予</p>
<p>免　　稅　五年。以後牟山湖及各河道仍須繼續疏濬，堰壩也要修理，所以規定領耕農戶在取得產權條，須向水利協會繳納六利費，每畝折穀五十斤，一俟工作完竣，即行停繳，並現定最多　十年爲限。</p>
<p>春耕期近，鄕　前往登記請領墾田者，極爲踴躍。濬墾會正在向農行商洽農貸，作為購置耕牛，農具，種籽，肥料之用，聯總復耕隊的曳引機十四輛，早已運到。今春擬先將大麥·小麥。豌豆·蠶豆·油菜·紫雲英等作爲試驗。預料日後機械化耕植而獲得豐收時，農民將更熱烈地歌頌這項工程的偉大。（奔珠）</p>

<h3>埠際足球　日期緊迫　香港足球總會　編排代表陣容</h3>
<p>【本報香港航訊】港滬埠際足球賽，已到密鑼緊敲的時候，滬隊埠際代表已經選出，香港方面也定二月二日由足球總會編排。今年的埠際代表，不舉行遴選賽，由總會依照球員平時演出水準，去決定代表資格。關於埠際　對抗程序，早已排定如下：</p>
<p>二月十日　香港隊對上海隊　三時半　香港會</p>
<p>二月十一日　華聯對上海隊　三時半　香港會</p>
<p>二月十四日　西聯對上海隊　三時半　香港會</p>
<p>盛大的歡宴秩序，也正排定兩個，一是十二日晚由香港華人足球聯會，假金陵酒家設宴款待上海埠際隊，二是足球總會在十四日晚假香港大酒店，設雞尾酒歡宴上海隊代表。</p>
<p>今年香港足球人材鼎盛，依常理而測，滬隊恐怕不易與香港對抗，根據平時觀察所得，香港埠際隊，將會產生下列的陣容。但十一日由華聯對抗上海隊，華聯必爭勝利，主將馮景祥，恐未易擔任兩場球的比賽重責。香港埠際隊可能排出如下：</p>
<p>▲埠際隊　小告山奴，余耀德，侯榕生，鄒文治，陳利，劉松生，朱永強，基亞能，蕭維路，馮景祥，何應芬</p>
<p>▲華聯隊　謝錦洪，譚均韓，侯榕生，馮坤勝，宋靈聖，張金海，朱永強，黎兆榮，陳德輝，馮景祥，何應芬</p>

<h3>國家行局昨在四聯集會　審查申請收購案件　核准收購成品以棉織肥皂居多　今後日集會至農歷年底為止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局爲代理政府收購成品，昨日下午四時，假四聯分處召開第一次審査委員會。到劉攻芸，王紫霜，朱通九，刁民仁等多人。劉攻芸主席，當審核由請收購案件五六起，申請收購款額共一百餘億元，全部核准通過。昨日申請案件，以棉織肥皂兩工業佔多。聞該會今後每日在四聯分處舉行一次，至農曆年底爲止，俾逐日審核國家行局所彙核之甲請案件。各廠商申請收購成品時，須先向各關係行局索塡：　工廠過去六個月生產統計表，　申請收購成品淸單，　最近資產負債表等共三種表格，呈由各關係行局調査彙核，核准者一二日內可得款額。所收購之各廠成品，將夾將交由中信局公開標售云。</p>
<p>本市工業界對收購辦法，頗多顧慮，渠等認爲一則收購成品數量有限，對國家之助力恐不大；二則恐懼政府於收陴此項成品後，爲平抑物價計，將以低價向市塲抛售，則廠商將深受其害。</p>

<h3>現象與實質</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>把一條竽子放在水裏，看去是彎的，實際是直的。彎是那條竿子在水裏的表現，直是它的原樣。這裏分別在哲學上呌做現象（Appearance）與實質（Reality）的分別。我們日常生活中，可是一個人知識幼徲的時候，往往以所見爲眞，在他不發生眞與似　問題，全人類知識　昧的時期也是這樣。然而求眞是人類的本性，人類很早就不安於現象，想在現象背後追求實質。</p>
<p>人類的學問就是人類在這條路上　　　成績。學問在程度上　　　　精粗的分別，方向郤是相同　：都想撥開其所硏究的東西　現象，而直追其實質。到現代　科學哲學，在現階段上可謂登峯這極了。眞假有程度的高低，換句話說，現象與實質有程度的不齊，因此，學問才有深淺精粗的分別。當識對於眞假的分別是　　，科學深一層，哲學又深一層。例如竿子在水裏，常識能辨得出它是直的，過此以往，如竿子是什麼，何以在水裏會顯得彎　，等等問題，就不再迫問了。科學　進　步，如關於竿子是什麽　問題，科學便不安　常識所承認。它　圓而神長　實質，便把它析成織　，再　成細胞，再析成細胞核與細胞質，……更進面分子，而原子，而電子，哲學　進一步，對於科學最後所承認的物質，都要問問究竟是什麼。人類知識　存在，科學家視爲固然，哲學家却要問它是什麼，如何產生，如何成立。可見哲學在求眞方面，比科學更要澈底，科學所認爲實質的，哲學還是把它當作現象，而求其背後的實質。非但如此，科學所求是宇宙一部分的眞，一部分的實質，哲學所求是宇宙全體的眞，全體的實質，因此，哲學不但比科學深，還比科學廣：哲學所從事者，可謂求眞之眞，求實質之實質。</p>
<p>一事一物呈現於人而成現象，現象與那事那物有別，爲什麽呢？事物是客觀的，無論人見它不見它，它總是那樣。可是人們觀物，有種種的內因與外緣，凑合起來，面使所見的與那物的原樣有差。如　張圖畫，正面看，側面看，從上看，從下看，陽光裏看，燈火中看，所見各各不同。—這是外緣方面的地位，方向，與光綫，種種之足以促成這張畫的現象與實質的分別。至於內因方面，有人類公共的，有個人私有的：人類公共的，如感官的構造和理解的認識，會把一個實質上平面的同案乃其中顏色的配合，看成一件立體的東西；個人私有的，如那人藝術上的素養，當時的情緒，眼睛　狀况，……等等，都能使得一張　對他有某種時殊的現象。</p>
<p>以人視物，旣不　脫離內因外緣上種種　障，那麽所得只是現象，怎能撥開現象面迫其實質？只好用參校糾核的辦法。如竿子在水裏顯得彎的，可以拿出水外看看，再用手摸摸，所得結果便有以糾正方才所見其在水中的樣子。這是以前後同類與不同類的知覺互相校核。假如認爲知覺與知覺難分高下，莫辨孰眞孰假，還可訴諸理性：用物理學上折光的原理證明竿在水中何以會顯得彎的，—這是以理性校核感官。以理性校核感官，得眞的可能性，比感官彼此校核還大些。校核的範關愈廣，方法愈精密，得眞的可能性愈大。人類學術的進步，就是求眞而得眞的程度增高，雖然不敢說已達到宇宙的實質，總是逐漸接近了它。</p>

<h3>「以工建國」之先決問題</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>以工建國並不是新的口號。太平天國以後，所謂「中興名臣」，曾國藩左宗棠李鴻章輩都是提倡新工業的有力人物。像江南製　局福建船政局甘　織呢局等，在常時已經很有規模。爲什麽經過八十多年之久，中國工業還不能在世界上佔一地位？工業落後實在是中國貧弱的主要原因。當茲建國開始，亟應把病源審察一番，藉為　　發葉之針。常然經濟離不了政治，政治不修明，經濟不會有辦法，但反渦來也可說經濟是政治的基礎，這個問題太多了，須別爲論說。現在祗就工業本身立論，作者深感有幾個先決問題，是「以工建國」成販利鈍的　　，想略為說明。</p>
<p>工業硏究問題　二十世紀的最大特色爲　知識的傳佈，即以科學硏究的成績　系統地應用於民生日用。　　大小硏究機關都儘量以硏究結果貢獻　社會，工業界以此爲　藉，而作最善　利用。科學方法是因，工業技術是果。以工建國第一個間題傳是腦力（Brain-power）問題。我們不但要設法利用先進國已有的成績相現成材料，（實際上我們運這一步還不曾努力做好）還得迎頭趕上，自己硏究。如何謀大學與工　之溝通，實爲根本要圖。大學應該保持　術自由，不應偏重實用，話固估是不錯。但大學與工業界能密切合作，互相了解，使中問工業不至完全依賴傳統拔術，隨時吸收新觀念，加　其在世界市塲上之競爭能力，同　　成國民愛好硏究的心習，使其成爲民族性之一特點，這當然也是大學應盡的責任。大學替工廠訓練人才，試驗材料，解決問題，工　對大學有經濟上的補助，以供充　設備之用，互助之道就是互利目前山國科學人才有限，自以集中於大學爲宜。民間工業目前很少自己有力量設立完善的實険室。至於中央政府所辦的少數實驗所，也不容易完全顧到各地方的需要。所以工業硏究問題各地大學實屬青無旁貸。今後專科學校亦不應僅以　練技術人才爲限，對於硏究工作應　加注意。專科學校的地域分佈，政府應有合理的標準，藉免重複與偏枯的幣病。</p>
<p>工業區位問題現　代世界各國所謂區域設計，其目的在使全國　業的各種要素，如原料·動力·人工·運輸·市塲以及氣候水源種抓問題有通盤的籌劃，對於人力物力作最有效的使用，爲最有利的分佈。在戰時爲應付國難，往往不其計較牛產成本，但在平時，各業必須能自行發展。故於經濟觀念與國防觀點，不能不多方考慮，期於至當。工業區位之研究，非僅爲一種工學或一個區域着想，而常爲全體工業與整個國家着想。從遠處看，耍注意到世界地位，從近處子，一個區域之內還應分爲許多副區，詳細考察。中山先生建國方略實業計劃一書，已經指出了外國工業建設的幹綫和重點。這是大綱，還需要更精詳的硏究，收集資料，分析統計，根據過去的經驗，復參攷世界潮流，爲中國新工業之地理分佈，作切實的貢獻，使國策可以充分實現，這一種新起的專門硏究，稱爲工業地理學。過去工業的失敗要不外乎天時地利人和三者，硏究三者的相互關係，便是工業地理學的任務。我們深信有了民族利益而後私人利益方有所寄託，有了全國性的設計，而後各區域的設計方有意義。</p>
<p>工業管理問題　這個問題就是勞工問題之科學硏究，其目的在提高工作效率或工作精神，（Merale）使每一男女工人均能達到最大限度的生產。工業管理不僅要養成訓練有素的工人，而且要養成有見識肯負責的公民。這種科學研究包含許多方面，例如工業心理學便是其中最重要的一門。工廠廠址的遷地爲良，也是新近的趨勢。自從工業革命以後，工廠皆設在大都會，造成人口集中的現象，　致發生種種社會問題。現代因電力傳遞的便利，工業趨於疏散，向郊外發展，或者開闢新都市，所謂花園城，人口大都在　萬至工萬人。這些新工業區，可憑理想創造，對於工廠內部，如光綫通風溫度濕度，固然要講求，藉以减少疾病，增進健康。對於工廠以外的環境，如醫院學校圖書館娛樂塲以下其他物質上文化上的便利，莫不顧及，成人與見童一樣看重。這種設施，不僅基　戰時經驗，適應空軍時代的需要，其極力爲工人謀幸，福實堪繼為建國經綸。要之工業管理的理想，不僅在减少工作時間，增加閒暇時問，實欲爲工人解除生活的壓迫與失業的恐懼，這是社會安全所應付的代價。</p>
<p>資源配合問題　俗話說，「牡丹雖好，綠葉扶持。」除非由農林漁牧礦產諸多方面積極改良，同流並進，所謂「以工建國」，終如海市蜃樓，可望而不可即。中山先生右鑒及此，時提出建設的十大綱領，即一交通，二商港，三都市，四水力，五工業，六礦業，七農業，八灌溉，九林業，十移民。任何一項均須以其他九項爲必需條件。他極力主張加强內地與邊疆的維繫，認為從內地通邊疆的鐵道是國家最有利益的投資。工業乃整個經濟建設的一環，若以辭害意，「以工建國」一語實不可通。作者會有建國方略之十大綱領一文，（載於思想與時代月刊第十期與第十一期）茲不備述。</p>
<h3>戰時美國哲人的活動</h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>美國哲學界在這一次大戰期中的活動，因爲戰時交通的關係，我國知道得很少。他們的刋物和書籍，我們多半接不到，所以他們究竟做了些什麽事情，我們實是茫然。現在戰事結束了兩年多的時間，美國哲學界在戰時的活動，我們已逐漸明瞭，同時美國哲人對他們自身的工作也有了一種頗爲詳細的報吿。茲擬根據這種報吿來叙述戰時的美國哲人的活動，這不僅對於我國哲人是一種借鑑，這對於一般讀者也可藉此知道「哲學雖烤不出麵包」，哲學却不是在任何　　上為無用之物。</p>
<p>我們先每把美國　人對這一次　爭的態度說明。在納粹發動戰爭之後，珍珠港事變未發生之前，美國哲學曾　東部支曾即曾開一次大會，議決了表同情　反抗軸心國家的侵略的決議。這決議是以兩種假定及一種事實為根據的。兩種假定是：　　學乃志在尋求對一切人均將爲眞確的智慧，　及這種智慧僅能由人類機能的自由運用而獲得。一種事實是，現在軸心國家的政府却把種族或民族置諸人類之上，把武力置諸是非和眞理之上。換一句話說，美國哲人所以也站在反抗軸心國家的共同　綫上的主要理由，就是因爲軸心國家的獨裁阻碍了人類機能的自由運星，因而使哲學不能獲得眞確的智慧。至關於戰爭的倫理對於無抵抗主義或和平主義間的問題，則美國哲人沒有討諭。</p>
<p>美國哲人的態度如此，所以珍珠港事變發生之後，美國哲人便積極的參加了戰爭。許多哲人，可服兵役的和年齡稍老的，都在美國戰爭楊構上的各部門中工作，且有不少表現了很優良的成績。這些哲哲人的工作很複雜，有的派到俘處營中去管理俘虜有的派到紅十字會中去做事，有的在軍隊裏當牧師，有的參加訓練新兵的工作，有的在國內，有的在國外。其尙留在大學裏敎書的哲人，也减少了他們講授哲學的鐘點，而去講授其他科學以及和軍事有關的課程。如數學，物理，化學，地理，氣象，語言等等，都有哲學家在講授？因此他們的工作時間增加，他們的假期减少，以至大部分沒有假期。他們且曾特別爲服兵役的軍人寫了一本「哲學緖論」（Preface　to　Philo　opliy）由數位著名的哲人，如霍金敎授（W.E.Hocking）等執筆，這些都可以說是美國哲人對於戰爭直接有關的工作。</p>
<p>美國哲人對於戰爭固盡了他們的資任，做了他們顧做的工作，可是對於他們本身的工作，美國哲人也並沒有忽視。在大學方面，美國大學的哲學　並不因戰事影響而停頓。學生人數一般的雖减少了，然在女子大學及男女同學的大學裏，其哲學系的人數，反見增加。同時各大學哲學系的研究生，則因退伍軍人及外國留學生的增加而增加起來。因而各大學的哲學系所收容的學生都達到最高限度。因參戰而離開大學的哲學敎授其缺額則由許多在納粹統治下受壓　而逃來美國的敎授補上，所以尙無缺少敎授之慮。至哲學系的課程，本身也少變動，惟對如下的課程，若社會和政治哲學，民主政治哲學，戰爭與和平的哲學，拉丁美洲的哲學，則或新開，或加以注重。有多少大學的哲學系甚且在戰時擴大起來，如康乃爾大學和耶魯大學便是。美國的哲學敎育可說在戰時反而發達起來。</p>
<p>其次，美國哲人所組織的各種哲學學會在戰時也並沒有完全停頓。美國哲學會東部支會一九四一年十二月曾開過一次會，西部支會也在一九四二年的四月開過一次會，以後便因交通關係停開了數年。惟哲學和心理的南方學會，西南哲學會議，以及符號邏輯協會，則始終沒有停止牠們的活動。此外在戰時尚增加了幾種學會：一是一九三九年十二月二十三日在紐約成立的國際現象學會（International　Plenomenological　Society），一是一九四〇年十二月開始發起的科學，哲學，宗敎與民主生活方式的關　四　九月舉行第一次年會。即　　際性的哲學會議在戰時也曾在美國舉行過。一是一九四三年四月底在耶魯大學舉行的泛美哲學會議，一是一九四四年九月在海地舉行的國際哲學會議。</p>
<h3>T.V.A.</h3>
<p>— 李春芬</p>
<p>田納西河谷的新陳代謝</p>
<p>一·引言</p>
<p>十五年前的田納西河谷，是一塊病人膏盲　衰殘農野，經渦醫師的解剖診療，現在已一反萬日憔悴的面孔，儼然是一片花團錦簇的繁榮樂土了。這位救命　恩人，便是燴炙人口的T.V.A.　　.V.A.是田納西河谷管理局的簡稱（Eennessee　Valley　Valley　Authorily），成立於一九三三年，負責主持田納西河谷開發的區域設計，計劃熱行，和業務管理三項任務，以達成資源充分發展，合理利用，　適當保護的三重使命</p>
<p>二·日繼西河谷山今昔觀</p>
<p>田納西河谷位於美國甫南部，面積四萬力哩，氣候溫暖，冬溫而短夏熱而長，生季約二百日，雨量達五十吋左右，四季皆雨而以春夏較多。一般地勢，大率在五百至一千呎之問，東為山地，北爲低高原，西爲低原。北部屬玉米小麥廠，南屬棉花帶，西北盛產烟草。其自然資源，相當豐富，其中以水力（可能量達四百萬匹馬力）和磷酸鹽最爲重要。</p>
<p>本區因土地利用失調，過去多以一物判爲主，加以雨量强度很大，冬季地土凍結時問很少，所以土壤侵蝕根是强烈。在一九三二年以前一百年中，本區中等以上的農田，因土壤被蝕而不能耕種的，約佔二分之一，眞是駭人聽聞！並且田納西河上游，每當雨季，山洪暴發，奔注主流，而中下游交替之區，梯度頓减，下游一帶，常生水災；加以沿河又少湖泊諷節水量，所以流量差異很大，最低爲每秒8000立方呎，最高達500，000立方　，季節變化，很是極端。</p>
<p>總之，本區因人事未盡而寒酸畢露，以致淪爲經濟落後地區之一。至一九三三年，T.V.A.奉命設立，收拾殘局，作方計劃的救治。救洽重心，在於水土保持，如築壩，植林，舖草，改良農事等項。因直接的防治而間接得極大的收獲，整個田納西河谷的面目為之一新。茲略舉數端。以見一般：　防洪“一九四六年一月，察特諾嘉城洪水位高35.7呎，因阻水墧的節制，减低十呎，否則該城將遭遇歷史上第五次大水災，全區可能因此次洪水損失一千萬元。　發電：田納西河的生流，設有船閘，以利　運；支流設有水壩，用以發　。　四六年發電量達一百二十億瓩時，較一九三三年增加十一倍。　航運：日納西河　運輸量，一五四五年達256，000，000噸哩，較一九三三年增加八倍。自諾古斯維至巴都卡，共長六五二哩，預定於一九五〇年疏濬完成，可以維持一灤達九呎的航道。　農林和保士：主要工作爲農事實驗和示範，如植林，舖草，梯耕，魏築溝壩，開挑水渠，作物輪種，施用肥料，採用新種，改良耕作，推廣飼畜，灌溉排水，農品產銷，以及電化農村等等。經過十餘年努力的結果，把巳經被土蝕破壞的田園，又恢復生產了，一九四四年農地因表土的冲蝕而荒蕪曰的，較之一九三四年，已不及其十分之一了。　製肥：利用西部蘊藏的磷酸鹽，於成爾遜壩的附近，設有大規模製造高級磷肥和硝酸錏廠，所出產品，在戰時供給軍用，平時用以肥田，據去年的報吿，在第二次大戰中T.V.A.供給軍用的磷，佔全國百分之六十，數達十萬噸；第一次大戰時全區的供給量祗有一千噸。目前購用T.V.A.磷肥的農家，共達三萬九千家，廣佈二十九州。　工業發展與人口職業調整：十幾年前，各地已有工業設立，但規模很小。自從水壩相繼完成，廉價電力出售，於是新興工業，便先後的勃興了起來。現在除製肥外，還有食品，紡織，衣服，木作，造紙，製革，橡皮，陶器，機機，運輸設備，等的製造工業，其工業結構，殆已達到一多面平衡發展的階段。本區因新與工業發展，人口職業的分配，也跟着調整。一九四〇年，農業人口，二倍於工業的雇工，但至一九四四年的下半年，從事工業的比率，已佔居上風了。</p>
<p>T.V.A.的異地應用</p>
<p>十五年的建設，田納西河谷，由荒殘進入繁榮，經過了一次新陳代謝。所以許多有心人士，要想把道一套新的錦囊妙計，應用到其他的地域。美國的密蘇里河谷區，早已有人計劃一個M.V.A.；我國揚子江一和贛江流城的Y.V.A.和　V.A.，也是T.V.A的異地應用；歐洲的多惱河流域，也曾有人發出過組織D.V.A.的呼聲，這在原則上並無不可行之處，事在人為，祇要有關各國，精誠相見，以全流域人民的福利為前提，多惱河未嘗不可變為多樂河。</p>
<h3>說「誠」（下）</h3>
<p>— 不黨</p>
<p>「誠」乏用</p>
<p>所謂「致曲」，所謂「自明誠」，「立己」「成己」之功，其事在於盡己之性：凡心身之所識所行莫非至道定理，而所得於天之道以為德者無不充實，於是知足以知其性分之常然，仁勇足以行之，以致乎其極。若夫「立人」「成物」，則惟「盡人之性」，「盡物之性」；欲盡人物之性，亦惟推已及人，推人及特而已矣。故曰：「能盡斯性，則能物之性」。蓋人之性猶己之性，則推其所以知己者以知人，所以立己者以立人，使人亦有以自知其性分之當然，而用其仁勇之功以行之，以致乎其極，斯則所謂「盡人之性」者矣。人與物皆天地之所生，俱　天地之理以爲性，旣能知人之性，而使之各致乎其極，乃亦有以知物之性，而使之各得其所，故曰，「能盡人之性，則能盡物之性」。盡物之性，其效「爲能經綸天下之大經，立犬下之大本，知天地之化育」。「經」者常也，「大經」猶言「達道」，即君臣·父子·夫婦·兄弟·朋友，所「五常」者已。「經綸天下之大經，」謂理人事，以正「五常」。「大本」即所謂「中」，「中」猶「降衷」之「衷」，蓋即天命之性；「立天下之大本」者，以敎化之功，使人「各正性命」之謂也。「知天地之化育」者，言洞澈乎宇宙萬物變遷成毀之故，今世理論科學之能事，端在此矣。「知天地之化育」，則有以「贊天地之化育」，今世應用科學之所施，往往上天入地，破山川之睽隔，變險為夷，脫路途之修阻，化遠爲近，夫非贊天地之化育耶？</p>
<p>「誠」與「誠之」之能事極於「知天地之化育」，「贊天地之化育」，其效「則形，形則著，著則明，明則動，動則變，變則化」；其功則「無息，不息則久，久則徵，徵則悠遠，悠遠則博厚，博厚則高明」。蓋「誠者」內之心之所識悉為共理公例，外之身之所行莫非共理公例之實施；身之所接而為行者，殊事殊物之有表迹可求者也，故曰「形」。無形無迹之理例施於有形有迹之事物，而其效見，故曰「著」。理例著於事物之間，事物悉得其所以然之故，而晦昧者莫不彰明，故曰「明」。明夫事物所以然之故，斯能據其理例，而左右張主乎其間，故曰「動」。動，則變生；變生，則有以因時制宜，隨境取適，其效有非拘虛囿習之輩所可得而窺測者焉，故曰「化」。唯夫「誠者」之心身內外，思慮云為，皆天地之道之表見，故能「无息」。「不息則久」，物莫不然：日月星辰之運行，唯其不息，乃能與天地幷久。至若人體之生，以其新陳代謝之機不息；江河之水不腐，以其長流無已。久則功成效著，故曰「久則徵」。功成效著，則播於殊方異城，故曰「徵則悠遠」。「悠」者久也，言其時間；「遠」者大也，言其空間。「誠者」之道德功業，其行遠如天地之博大，其傳世猶天地之悠久，而其爲萬百代所瞻仰也，又若天地之高明，之悠久無區，故日：「博厚配地，高明配天，悠久無疆。」苟能如此，則其功與天地等，斯能「不見而章，不動而變，無爲而成」矣。此儒家之以人擬天而設爲理想八格也。（續完）</p>

<h3>關於連環圖畫</h3>
<p>— 茂公</p>
<p>見報上有「一市民火聲疾呼，挽救國家未來的主人翁，」原來是說「有毒索的運環圖帶應取締。」吾老矣，已非國家木來的主人翁，雖看有毒素的通環圖畫也應不在挽救之列，但兒輩運最大的亦年未弱冠，常爲未來主人公無疑，而他們就不十分不愛看運環圖書。我平常不曾注意及此，故未知有毒與否，今聞右人疾呼，乃把他們所看的檢査一下，其「圖畫惡劣」，「文字粗俗」，「內容荒唐無稽」，誠如大聲疾呼者所說，但是否有「毒素」値得「挽救」，則我一時還不能加可否，須待看遍了所有運環圖畫再說。</p>
<p>以上云云，也許你誤以爲我有爲迎環圖畫篇護之意，其實不然。我只覺得一般連環圖畫的「圖畫惡劣」，不過不及名畫家的優美罷了，「文字粗俗」，不過不及古文名家的典雅罷了，「內容荒唐無稽」，不過神怪武俠罷了，孩子們如以之爲學費作文的範本，經世濟民的寶典，當然殊不適宜，若不過隨便看看，則似乎朱必有毒素在，會得看出毛病來。有些小學課本上的圖畫文字，就未必不惡劣粗俗。至於內容之荒唐無稽，敎課書固不應有，因其原要使讀者修身齊家治國平天不的，但在閑書之中，神怪武俠不足爲病，如說小孩看了就此神魂顚倒，甚至入山求道，那麼即使不是病牙之人吃了牛肉要牙痛之類，事情亦非取締連環圖畫所能了，蓋小孩們日常據觸的圖畫文字之不亞於連環圖畫者多矣。</p>
<p>隨便試舉一例，報紙上無不有電影戲劇廣吿。其文字之粗俗，有些比逋環圖畫要「有毒素」的多，連環圖畫文字之粗俗，是不通或不修飾，而有些電影戲劇廣吿文字之粗俗，却是香艷肉感的粗俗。大家天天看報，不必在此引證。</p>
<h3>記埃反皇帝法勞克</h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>當代的埃及皇帝法勞克是阿刺伯各國巾最有幾勢的人物，但是同時也是一個悲喜劇　　主角。</p>
<p>據一個訪問過他的　　記者的記載，他是一個廿五　　年輕人，身材肥胖，頭髮柔軟，生着藍灰色的限珠，也許出自他的曾外祖父塞凡上校的遺傳</p>
<p>法勞克早年在英國攻讀，各報紙一致稱頌他是「世界上敎養最完備的孩子」。十二年前，他的父親弗埃特皇帝駕薨，他得訊遄返埃及，不久便繼承王位。</p>
<p>先是，弗埃特皇帝登基之初，係承繼他的兄弟和　皇帝的統冶。弗埃特最初身無半文，在位期間，由於人民的孝敬，醵資達美金五千萬元之鉅，全部留給法勞克，因此，後者差不多在埃及每一項重要的工商業內，都有他的股份。他是國中首屈一指的財</p>
<p>勞克　帝　有華貴的「羅爾斯·羅愛斯」牌汽車十輛，又派加特牌汽車中五輛。他愛搜集　　·郵票·錢幣·勳章·　錶及古本可蘭經。他嗜吃朱古力糖，閑時歡喜游泳和搬取野鴨。他的遺憾是：常常鬧失眠症和不能說純正的英語。</p>
<p>遠在一九四二年正月，埃及發生政變。內閣總理和刑·壽里·巴夏氏，被迫去位。法勞克擬使命以反英著稱的亞里·　赫·巴夏氏，出任新總理。是年二月，英國駐埃及大使藍浦　爵士提出異議，推　麥斯特發，納哈斯·巴夏氏繼任，但是遭法勞克拒絕，並示意英大使，知照他即日歸國。</p>
<p>藍浦遜大使無法可施，轉請當時美國駐埃及公使亞力山大·寇克氏斡旋。如果法勞克能選任親英美的人物，必可博得美國好　。然而法勞克不爲所動。到了二月四日埃皇二次接見英國大使，藍浦遜氏由英國駐埃及衛戍司令官史東少將伴同進宮。</p>
<p>藍浦遜大使覲見後，他取出兩道公文。一道要求埃臯退位，由專機載往南菲。另一道公文則要求坎皇任命納　斯。巴夏爲新總理。</p>
<p>當時　　　不決，英國重隊却已包團皇宮，聲勢洶洶，皇宮的衛隊，衆　懸殊。同時另有輕坦克車兩輛，駛進宮內，顯赫一時的埃皇，不啻成了階下囚。藍浦遜大使要求皇上憑窗俯敝他所佈置的一齣好戲。</p>
<p>埃皇暫時默不作聲。據說後來他這樣說道：「你呌我找不出別的方法，因爲我不願意退位。不過我永遠忘不了這一會事」。</p>
<p>至此，藍浦遜爵士和史東少將退出皇宮。據開羅當地人士的傳說，事後，埃皇大發雷霆，足足鬧了一小時，一會擊桌子，一會擇玻璃器皿，連墻壁上張掛的圖畫，都給踢了下來。</p>
<p>關於埃皇和英國的離齬，還有一件流行的故事。相傳在世界第二次大戰爆發後不久，法勞克接連鬧失眠，夢中爲一頭猛獅所追逐。他向亞爾·亞薩哈回敎大學校長馬喇吉氏求治。馬喇吉氏對他說：「皇上一定要擊斃一頭獅子後，才能安眠」。於是埃皇上動物園去，槍殺了兩頭獅子。但是他依舊做着同樣的夢，又去向馬喇吉請敎，馬喇青搶白他道：「你這個傻瓜。我說的是一種　別的，就是英國呢」</p>
<h3>舊書攤</h3>
<p>— 張心如</p>
<p>住在上海，買是很方使的了。不幸的是我和書店之間，始終隔着一道無形的　。偶一同進　店，除了埀涎三尺以外，只有對着那些買書的人大生其　之心。心灰之餘，退而求其次；於是將所有的空閑，都拿去跑舊書攤。</p>
<p>所謂舊書攤，並不是一般所　　　　店　　舖之類；——那說的書，雖然也臺，但是收拾得較為　齊，訂價也並不太低，有　反而高得怕人，那許是書店老開太　貨了的緣故。而擺舊書攤的呢，或者都是些收買破爛東西的傢伙吧，他們又沒有門面，只不過臨時搭個木架，或者就利川店家的窗戶台　，而最多的倒只是一堆一堆擁在水門汀地上，每堆只用紙牌標上一個共同的價目，任憑你挑選，只要你能够挑得出心愛的東西來，你總會十分驚喜，因爲那價錢是和買故紙差不了許多的；比較起書店裏摸摸就是十幾萬的本子，實在便宜得使人沒有話說。</p>
<p>依照我的經濟狀况來說，即使這樣低廉的貨色，也仍然可以算作奢侈品的；然而只要手上有幾張鈔票，總會身不由已的跑向福州路去。那裏路兩旁，小書推可眞多極了，我經常是從馬路的右邊跑過去，再從左邊跑回來，挨着次序一堆一堆的搜索。我把這事呌做「開礦」。眞的，要從那亂糟糟的破本子堆裏，找出合意的東西，實在也不容易。那貨色又是那麽五花八門，古怪離奇：有老古董，也有新玩意；有江湖秘訣，魔術大全，也有原子彈硏究；有京劇唱本，白得詡譜，也有流行歌曲，三角　愛；有五四時代的「新青年」，也有嚴　後方用土紙印刷的名著……你要挑一本，至少也得　他個幾十本，說不定你翻上半天，會通一本也挑不上。</p>
<p>這就需要耐心了。只要沒有事情，我常常可以在那裏流運半天；這種沙裏淘金的發掘，反而給了我以濃厚的處味，我覺得偶然的成功有一種引誘的力量，一几發現一木難得的小書，那高興是不可以音喻的。而且這種書擬子還有一種好處，他們差不多每天都有新的貨色添進，活偈是一個窮苦讀書人的流通圖嘗館。大概是有許多生活艱　的朋友，經常在利用這種「賣了舊君買新醫」的方法去補給他們的精神食糧吧，我覺得我大大地沾了他們的光了。</p>
<p>今天收拾箱子，順便檢視一下幾個月來用兩條腿跑來的一大堆舊書，心上禁不住揚起了喜悅的漪漣，然而，立即也就有一片沈車的陰影襲來；我在想：暫時這些襤褸而可愛的寶貝們是安靜而舒適的躺在這兒，但是不知道那一天，也許它們又會像落葉一樣再度飄泊到街頭上去了。</p>
<h3>香檳酒的起源</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>揭開香檳酒瓶，必然先是有「拍」的一聲，這聲響對嗜愛杯中物的人們直如最天妙的音樂，非獨動聽，並且令人　涎</p>
<p>第一個對到這興奮音樂的人是杜姆庇爾。皮利能，一個微賤的法國黑衣敎的小敎士。但是，自從他發現了香檳酒之後，他的名聲却得以垂三百餘年之久而未湮沒。</p>
<p>那時，好大喜功窮奢極侈的路易十四正高居法蘭西的能庭，而在香檳省理姆斯城的高山上則有一羣虔誠但歡樂的黑衣敎士在農田之間推行他們的敬神的仟務。但是，他們的宗敎的責任和他們的其貧窮的神聖的誓言都不能阻止他們享受幾杯區中所產的沒有甜味的淡葡萄酒的樂趣。</p>
<p>皮利能愉快的將農夫們所送給他的酒接受下來，把它們分門別類，加以處理，然後再在適當的時候裝瓶。他手中拿着蠟燭，裏緊飄盪的外袍，走下郝維勒寺的大地窖。他嚐嚐這種酒，試試那種酒，一個下午就過去了。當他從石梯上來的時候，他的臂中總挾有幾瓶佐餐的美酒。</p>
<p>據說，皮利能是一個有學問的人，他對葡萄樹，葡萄，和酒的知識是全村中無與倫比的；而且可能這種知識還超渦他對經書的知識。但是，有「天他造成了個嚴重的錯誤。不過，有了這個錯誤才產生了香　　。</p>
<p>在寺中的那些白　的大地窖中，有幾隻酒桶專盛釀期未滿的新酒，這些酒桶都被按照葡萄園；葡萄種，和收穫的時期刻上特別的標誌。另有一些桶子則專盛成熟的陳酒。尋常，兩者是分別放開的，皮利能每天下午慣例的來裝瓶的全是汲取陳酒。但是，有一天，在一種不可思議的情形之下，這兩種酒桶竟被放錯了地方，陳酒與新酒混雜了起來。皮利能由於他的倉促，或者由於他而心不在焉，居然未曾警覺到酒桶上的標誌——雖然他在裝瓶之後忠實的將標誌抄錄下來貼在酒瓶上。這些瓶酒被放在地窖的另一個角落裏，因為，皮利能是一個知道酒愈陳愈佳的人。</p>
<p>隔了好幾月以後的一個下午，皮利能又下地窖來取酒了。他以爲那些誤灌的瓶酒應該够陳了，便將它們取了出來。</p>
<p>皮利能有一個習慣，每次暢飲之前必須先開啓一瓶嚐嚐味道是否够佳。他隨手的取了一瓶，又隨意的將瓶塞拔掉；但是，拍然的一響，使他嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>「啊」，他自忖道，「這眞是太糟糕，酒壞了！」</p>
<p>不過，爲了確定酒是否眞的壞了，他用鼻子向瓶口聞了聞，而那氣息却是令人出奇的興奮和醉人。他困惑的傾倒一點在酒杯中，驚愕的發現無數的金黃色的小泡泡在酒面上跳躍。他啜飮了一　。</p>
<p>「天使下凡了！」他不禁歡呼起來。「她們在酒中留下了星星！」</p>
<p>這就是發現香檳酒的故事，假使你到香檳省去探詢香檳　的起源，那裹的人們所吿訴你的都是這同一的故事。</p>
<h3>買美國糖果</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>日前在一個美國人寫的一本洋洋百萬言的追憶二次大戰的巨著內，讀到一則紀事，大意謂在二次大戰期間，法國馬賽市，鬧過一件盜賣軍用物資的趣案。有個美籍黑種士兵答應出售三噸肥皂給一個法國商人，允於午夜送達，以機機密。他將貨物用卡車送到後，商人爬上卡車，打開箱子，騐明與指定的種類無誤。黑人堅持將貨款付清後，才肯卸貨。</p>
<p>次日早晨，商人滿心歡喜，以爲可以坐獲巨利，可是不旋踵問，就大失所望。原來那個黑人弄不到肥皂，却去裝了三噸炸棄來，所裝的箱子，與肥皂箱相似。此事後爲美軍當局査悉，對這法國商人愛莫能助，後者只有自認悔氣而已。</p>
<p>我想，這位法國商人，當時在被欺騙之餘，一定覺得情憤不平的。不圖近日筆者亦有類似的經騐（事實上有同感者，一定不祗筆者一人）·諸君在這幾犬內，不是在報上可以讀到某局委託各商店出售美國糖果的吿白麽？當然有幾家商店是很注重商業道德的，出售前先揀除劣貨，但是有幾家却不然。我到遇過這樣一家舖子：在外面張掛了寫着大字的布幔，載明欲購從速等宇樣，我不禁　進去向櫃員要了一條××牌的朱古力糖，打開紙包一看，不但有蛀孔，而且已發了霉。該店爲將損失轉嫁給顧客計，還有一項妙法，因爲依照該店的樑示，售出貨物是不能掉換的。</p>
<p>我頓時有了一種被欺騙的感覺。我覺得丟掉五千元是一件小事，幸　我是一個稍具常識的人，如果我聽信了店員的歪曲的解釋，（當時我正看見不少人，聽了店員一面之詞，成盒的將霉蛀的朱古力糖購去，）將朱古力吃下去，我想對我的健康總是不利的吧。</p>
<p>因此，我最後希望出售當局，派貨時能將　爛的剔出，商店店員更不應該强詞奪理，欺騙顧客，金錢損失事小，對於社會人民的健康，影響却很大呢。</p>
<h3>送竃</h3>
<p>— 過宜</p>
<p>俗　　月二十四爲　　日，不知其所自始，而五代時羅隱有送竃詩，則由來亦已甚久。隱詩云：「一盞淸茶一縷烟，　君皇帝上靑天，玉皇若問人間事，爲道文章不値錢。」此詩頗爲世人傳誦，以羅江東（隱）之名車當代，聞於敵國，猶有「文章不値錢」之嗟，又何怪措大寒酸之煮字不能療飢，然詠其詩終爲古今不遇之十同聲一哭！羅隱雖以詩見稱，同時無與爲輩，而相傳江南李氏遺使聘越，越人問見羅江東否？使人曰：不識亦不聞名。越人曰：四海聞有羅江東，何拙之甚？使人曰：爲金榜無名。此事劇可笑。聞名與否，以金榜爲言，自是使人之陋，其不知羅江東也固宜。然舉目滔滔，何一人不存此見梗於胸中，其才氣遠遜羅隠，而又無憑藉以爲梯級，欲求存今之世，不益難哉？「文章不値錢」，羅隱當日甚言之以寓慨，跡其遭際，猶不至此，設使生於今日，縱有羅給諫之材之　，亦不足以　妻子，終騰於</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第九章　洩漏機密（大一）</p>
<p>渚齊道：「這事我完全是處在被動的地位。姑丈知道我家裏的事，我父親這一間就不好　過，所以我一向對外不敢說，並不見蟎着姑丈。」肖柏見幾句話已把渚齊的眞情探出來，笑這：「綺紈注意你，我早已知道，不過你曾把這事情，細細攷　　沒有？」渚　道！「我已經攷　過，綺紈確是眞心眞意，要跟我，我也覺得人生能得一個知己，是不容易的。」肖柏道：她素性揮霍，以你現在地位，能供給得起嗎？」渚齋道：「這一點，我也曾細細考慮過，據綺紈的表示，她一不出去公演，在家裏不應酬，花費很省的，並且她有點私　，可以津貼家用。」肖柏搖搖頭道：「這個靠不住，這一點你要注意，不要將來成為一生之累。」渚齊道：「我認為不成問題，祇要彼此感情能融洽，啃寓寓頭過日，也是很快樂的。我認為嚴重問題，還是父親這方面，應如何疎通，能得老人家諒解。父親平日最欽重姑丈，可否由姑丈替我給父親說一說？我想姑丈出面一說，這事沒有不成功的。」肖柏道：「我可以給給你父親說去，可是事情若不成功，你又該怎辦呢？」渚齋道：「果然父親不贊成，我祇好國打別的主意。此時勢成騎虎，不能不辦。」肖柏道：「你打算怎樣辦呢？」渚齋道：「祇有出走吧！」肖柏　了，暗吃一驚，毓如祗此一個兒子，他一出走豈不把老人急壞了！肖柏心裏雖是遭樣想着，臉上仍現笑容，問道：「你果眞這樣打算嗎？」渚齋道：「不如此不能解決這難關。」肖柏道：「你不怕你父親因此氣壞嗎？」渚齋道：「我想不至如此，我去了仍可以回來。」肖柏道：「你不怕家庭發生風波？」渚齋道：「不會的，綺紈能自食其力，獨立門戶，各幹各的，自可避免一切衝突。」肖柏探出渚齋的口氣，知道勸阻無益，仍裝笑容道：「你們年輕人，眞是任性，不管別人，祗顧自己。」渚齋道：「這種事與家庭上沒什麼損失，尤其家父方面，一向和我分居，我們好幾天才見一面，翁媳本沒多大感情，我想這樣辦，眼前雖不贊成，過後便無所謂謂了！不過我總希望老人家能明白我的苦衷，贊成我娶綺紈，那是再好沒有，並且父親是最信仰姑丈的，祗要姑丈多進美言，我想不會不成功。」肖柏道：「我　然要給你說去。」渚　道：　這事說成功，我和綺紈同來請你做證婚人。</p>
<h3>監獄天堂</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>「諸位，」典獄長說，「我們很歡迎你們到這裏來，希望諸位同我們住在一起感到興趣。諸位已經知道這裏不是平當的監獄。守衛和善，食物優美，房間舒適窗窗上不裝鐵柵。諸位可以任意在監獄內外散步，如其你想逃走，沒有人會來阻止。但是有一條罰則，很嚴嘴　。—你就不准重入本益獄。」</p>
<p>以上是英國最新的現代監獄典獄長歡迎新犯人的演辭。此不裝鐵柵的監獄名韜德華斯監獄（Tortworth　Court），位於格魯斯德城的福爾飛爾村（Falfield），拓地四百　。</p>
<p>自工黨主政後對於監獄有一初步實驗，想用仁慈代替責罰，去「治療」罪犯。韜德華斯蓋獄收容罪犯二百六十人，建築物包括一幢堡壘形的中央大厦，以及無數軍用小屋。事實上這是一所軍營，戰時曾由美軍駐紥過，其中的設備　部與美軍留駐時相同。</p>
<p>長稱犯人爲「孩子們」（Boys），孩子們每天工作八小時。其餘時間以及星期日可以任擇消遺娛樂之道。室內游戲有彈子房和乒乓室。室外有游泳池，足球塲，釣魚的小湖。</p>
<p>監獄巾非常民主，獄友第一件要知道的事情，便是無須稱守衛以「老爺」（Sir）。這是建立若輩自尊心的因素之一。</p>
<p>親戚來訪，獄友們在一間陳設愉快的房間裏接待他們。房間遠處坐着一個便服守衛；他能够看到訪客和罪犯，但在聽覺能力不及之處。</p>
<p>每天的食物很好。有一個犯人說：「飯菜像宴會；我從來沒有嚐過這種烹飪。他們居然把馬鈴薯的皮也剝掉—這在別的監獄裏是從來沒有的事。還有監丁打搜尋餐室，洗滌碗盞。」</p>
<p>犯人中包括謀害者，剪絡，監守自盜者，縱火犯，强姦犯以及眞他犯罪。他們都是初犯，在允許送入　德華斯之前，每一人都經專家們考驗過，認爲可予自新者，才准入獄。</p>
<p>一天出了一件意外的事。七個人逃走了—那就是說，因爲監獄沒有鐵柵，沒有鐵蒺藜的籬笆，就這樣跑了出來，一去不返。他們後來都經捕獲，收在另一監獄之中。七個人都要求送回韜德華斯，大家都表示貿然離開這塊快樂的地方懊悔。可是永不能回去了，最不能　諒的罪惡便是逃</p>
<p>斯德事爾　（Stockholm）也有相類的現代監獄，建在美麗的村野中。每一犯人都有一間私室，像公寓一樣，倫敦鏡報社編輯鮑敦氏去參觀，見到某一犯人的房中飾有瓶花九起。壁上懸了名畫，書架上滿揷書籍，桌上有打字機，一遇閑暇，伏案賦詩。</p>
<p>另外一間房子裏，有一水手躺在床上讀書，牆上掛着自己畫的油畫，原來獄中有一守衛，擅於繪畫，水手即從他那裏討敎學來的。水手室中有一具手提琴，桌上有最近報紙。</p>
<p>每一室中都各自有無錢電，窗戶敞開，並無鐵柵。</p>
<p>這一種「旅館式拘留」非常成功，瑞典在今年有一大半犯人都可有福拘留在這種公開的獄室中。</p>
<p>據鮑敦氏意見，現代監獄並無感情作用，主持者正眞負起了拯救人類生命的重任。住在裏面的犯人只有哀怨，沒有憤怒。他們是覺司到被當作人看待的！</p>
<h3>論錶不必進</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>家裏的一隻掛錶天天好像走得慢一點，於是每有朋友來　閑談，孩子必問他「基伯伯，你的錶繼點鐘了，讓我們的跟你對一對。」鄙人朋友無多，經常枉顧者尤不過三五，好在他們人各有錶，不至於給孩子「坍台」。但對的結果也並不怎樣滿意，例如昨晚上一連來了三個朋友，孩子就一連對了三次，而越對却越不對了，結果等於不對。因爲與第一個來的朋友一對，我們的慢了十分鐘，對好不到半小時，第二個朋友來了，再一對我們的還是慢了五分鐘，就再如數撥快，再過一刻鐘第三位朋友來了，一對我們的却是恰好快了一刻鐘。孩子說一定第三個伯伯的錶走慢了，就不肯撥回。我素不以錶之準確與否爲意，壓次呌他不要以對錶爲急務而他殊不服從，現在我看他對得不知如何是好了，就說：你看對了有什麽用，對來對去還不是等於不對？不次決不許再對了。</p>
<p>孩子怎肯心服，說：怎麼可以不對，錶不準了如何能守</p>
<p>我：守雖的時刻？</p>
<p>孩：什麽都要守。上學校就要守，你去辦公也要守。</p>
<p>我：上學要守是不錯的，但錶何必對進？如果我們家的比你學校裏的慢，實際也許錯在你們學校裏的，因為也許是它走快了。不過學校總根據學學校時刻，那麼你把我們家這隻的時刻看快一點就是了，例如它八點而你看作八點一刻或三十分，餘類推。至於我的辦公呢，儘管你媽笑我　起床，老說「我們的錶是慢的呀，快起來快起來」，而實際我從不曾遲到扣薪過，因爲我總把我們的錶對慢一刻鐘，譬如明明走到七點了而我只君作六點四十五分。</p>
<p>孩：那不是你更要遲到辦公室了嗎！</p>
<p>我：決不。</p>
<p>孩：騙人！媽，爹爹騙人</p>
<p>我：並不騙你。你不知道我們辦公室裏的鍵比家裏的慢刻鐘。</p>
<p>孩：那麽上星期日曾叔叔下午二時結婚，你爲什麽要特爲到樓上趙家對錶去呢？</p>
<p>我：是呀·你知這結婚的時刻一定其準無比的，蓋所謂吉日良辰，不能錯過一分一刻，而家裏的錶老總你們說慢了慢了，我怕眞個慢了，遲去了觀禮不及，對不起朋友，所以特向你們總說最準最準的趙家之錶一對。</p>
<p>孩：足見得要</p>
<p>我：決不「足見」。　　了曾叔叔結婚的禮堂，牆上並無掛鐘，禮堂裏冷淸淸的，我以爲已經過時了呢，正想回頭走，忽見有人送喜幛來了，有人送花籃來了，又有穿得整整齊齊像賀客的人來了，心想或者還早，就又坐下。這一坐下可坐了不知多少時候，忍不住了向一個朋友的手錶對看，已經四點鐘了，再看看另一個的，却還四點缺五分，索性多看幾偶，則四點五分的也有，四點十一分的也有，四點缺一刻的也有，甚至還有十二點三刻。但總之請東上所說的二時總已過了不少，而婚禮迄未舉行。你想百年好合的人對良辰尙且不準守時刻，其餘瑣碎小事何足守哉。</p>
<p>：那麽剛才胡伯伯約你陰天下午準七點鐘吃飯，你就下必守時刻了。</p>
<p>我：當然不守。</p>
<p>孩：那麽人家吃過了呢？</p>
<p>我：假如你去，那麽一吃午飯就去總不會吃不着了。</p>
<p>孩：那麽你可以在晚上十二點鐘去。</p>
<p>我：那當然不行。不過他所謂準七點鐘我就對他說過何必大說笑話。一則以誰的鎭作準。以他的爲準呢，主人太不知客氣了。以客人的爲準吧，十個客人的　至少九個的不同。况且大家路上走多少功夫又不一定，甚至有的明明趕早去的，車輛不免會臨時出毛病，因此邋了難道是不守時刻。故我說請客帖子上應該寫「七時左右」，不必什麽「準」七時。而且實際上請客吃飯，說七時至早八時動筷，因爲客人中總有忙於赴宴的，當然有眞有假，總要遍到。我吿訴你一件故事；張家公公有次請一客人，定的下午六時半八時才來，他生氣了，再請一次定爲八時，客人近九時才來，索性再請他一次，定九點鐘，到時已九點半左右。最後一次定爲晚上十一時半，這位客人打電話來了，問何以如此之晚，公公說每次請你總是遲到，故索性午夜開始，飲到東方旣白如何。那客人此後不遲到了，但公公那樣的人有幾個？</p>
<p>孩：那麼趁火車明？</p>
<p>我：趁火車的人十九沒有錶也不曾脫班的，因為大家總是早一二小時到的車站。有錶的也總是早去，即使他的錶比全世界的都要快上一小時。因為萬一火車站的錶忽然撥快了一小時開走了，你能據那一隻錢力爭呢？</p>
<p>孩：如上司召見呢？</p>
<p>我：那與趁火車一樣。總之是無所謂守時刻。因之也無所謂誰的錶快誰的錶慢。</p>

<h3>Developing Taiwan's Resources: US-China Technical Discussions; We Propose New Aid Plan to the US</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 2nd] It has been learned that the US and China are in discussions regarding the development of Taiwan Province's resources and the support of Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises. Taiwan Province is rich in mineral resources, and their development would benefit domestic industrial development and the absorption of foreign exchange. The US is very willing to invest and assist in this. The emphasis is on two points: one is economic, namely supporting industrial and mining enterprises; the other is military, where the US will help us complete our naval base plan in the Taiwan Strait. In principle, this investment cooperation is no longer a problem. Currently, technical issues are being studied. If realized, in addition to economic aid, the US will also send a large number of technical personnel to Taiwan to assist in the work.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] Responsible individuals state that General Wedemeyer, during his on-the-ground investigation of the Chinese situation, proposed a South China Economic Revival Plan. It is said that if South China's politics and economy can be stabilized, the US is willing to provide assistance. Therefore, since Song Ziwen took office as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, he has taken various steps to make the area a national chemical industry center and strive to develop transportation and other industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 2nd] There has been new development in the issue of US aid loans to China. According to reliable sources, our government has indicated to the US its hope to obtain long-term, annual aid from the US if possible, to replace Secretary of State Marshall's proposed monthly aid plan. Our side's reason for proposing this new plan is that Marshall's 300 million loan, divided into 15 months, provides only 20 million USD per month, which is only used to balance our foreign exchange balance. However, the aid needed for China's current situation is not only to balance foreign exchange balance, but also to tighten currency and increase production, which are all routine matters. The above three aspects cannot be solved by monthly aid of 20 million USD. Therefore, the hope is to change to annual, long-term aid to thoroughly solve China's economic difficulties. This hope has been conveyed to the US State Department by our government. Whether the US agrees is currently unknown. According to informed sources, our country's foreign exchange balance deficit was 250 million USD last year. This year, the situation is better, and the estimated foreign exchange balance deficit will be 210 million USD. Marshall's proposed 300 million USD aid loan to China, to be paid in 15 months, is only sufficient to bring our foreign exchange balance into equilibrium.</p>
<p>US Draft of Aid to China Plan Now in Final Stages</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] Officials here are optimistic about the future of US aid to China. Efforts are now underway in Washington and Nanjing to have Secretary of State Marshall's recommendation submitted to Congress before February 20th. In Washington, Bei Zuyi and Ambassador Gu Weijun are strongly advocating China's need for aid to the US. In Nanjing, Chairman Chiang and President Zhang Qun are constantly discussing ways with Ambassador Stuart to ensure China is eligible for aid. These individuals believe that the US Congress will ultimately pass a loan to China based on the Marshall Plan. The only issues remaining to be negotiated are the amount and timing. Therefore, there is great interest here in the proposal by New York Governor Dewey to provide China with aid of more than 250 million USD annually for the next three to four years.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st, United Press] US Secretary of State Marshall will submit a new foreign aid bill to Congress on the 2nd. This bill is designed to prevent unexpected incidents and includes appropriations for aid to China and appropriations for the needs of the occupying forces.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] State Department personnel announced late on the 1st that the drafting of the aid to China plan has reached its final stage. State Department economic experts are also preparing a comprehensive list of the US aid needed by various countries around the world for Marshall to respond to Vandenberg's request, based on various sources of information. This comprehensive report will include the European Recovery Program, the aid to China plan, and other plans that the State Department deems necessary. It will take several days to prepare.</p>

<h3>Measures for Collecting Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year; Promulgated and Implemented by the Executive Yuan with Immediate Effect</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 2nd] The measures for collecting profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 37th year have been formulated and promulgated by the Executive Yuan and will be implemented with immediate effect. The estimated amount of income tax to be paid is still calculated at six times the profit tax of the 36th year. Newly established profit-seeking enterprises that have not yet paid taxes will pay at a rate of 12.6% of the actual amount of capital for which they have applied for registration. The full text of the measures is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The collection of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 37th year shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Law and these measures.</p>
<p>Article 2: The competent tax collection authority shall estimate the provisional tax amount after the beginning of the year and order the taxpayer to pay it first. After assessing the tax payable in accordance with the tax law, it shall notify the new tax. If there is an overpayment, it shall be refunded.</p>
<p>Article 3: The provisional tax amount shall be estimated in accordance with the following provisions: (1) Refer to the multiple of increase in the comparison between the budget of the 37th year and the 36th year's income and the budget of the profit-seeking enterprise profit tax, and the multiple of increase in the comparison of the 36th year and 35th year's general price index. The total amount of profit-seeking enterprise income tax and profit tax payable by each taxpayer as determined in the 36th year shall be temporarily calculated at six times the amount. (2) For profit-seeking enterprises newly established in the 36th year or established before the end of the 35th year but have not yet paid taxes, the amount shall be temporarily calculated at 12.6% of the actual amount of capital for which they have applied for registration. For the estimated provisional tax amount calculated in accordance with the first paragraph, if the business period in the 35th year is less than one year, or calculated in accordance with the second paragraph, if the business period in the 36th year is less than one year or more than one year, it shall be converted according to the proportion of the actual business period to the whole year.</p>
<p>Article 4: The competent tax collection authority shall, within one month from February 15, fill out payment notices for the estimated provisional tax amount for taxpayers, deliver them to the taxpayers, and limit them to pay within 30 days from the date of delivery.</p>
<p>Article 5: After the competent tax collection authority receives the taxpayer's declaration of income, the following profit-seeking enterprises shall immediately conduct account verification: (1) Companies; (2) Public-run enterprises and public-private joint ventures run by governments at all levels; (3) The head office and branches of business establishments are not located in the same place, the capital is not divided, the business is not independent, and the taxes should be consolidated by the head office; (4) Those who have been merged, dissolved, transferred, and closed down and have been liquidated; (5) Those who do not fall within the scope of the preceding four paragraphs, have complete account books, and have been designated by the competent tax collection authority.</p>
<p>Article 6: Profit-seeking enterprises that do not fall within the provisions of the preceding article may investigate their income based on the standard tax calculation system.</p>
<p>Article 7: Profit-seeking enterprises that investigate their income based on the standard tax calculation system shall compile various tax calculation standard ratios based on the data of the account verification firms in Article 5. If the number of firms compiling the standard ratio in the preceding paragraph is less than the number specified in paragraph 3 of Article 8, the firms with more complete account books and documents shall be investigated to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Article 8: The method of compiling the standard ratio is as follows: (1) When compiling, the industry shall be divided in detail. Within one industry, manufacturing and sales, wholesale and retail shall be distinguished. The amount of capital and business (or revenue) shall be divided into large, medium, and small grades. The competent tax collection authority shall determine separately according to the local situation and actual needs. (2) When calculating various capital turnover rates, sales gross profit rates, sales expense rates, capital gross profit rates, capital expense rates, capital revenue rates, revenue expense rates, sales net profit rates, and capital net profit rates by industry or class and grade, the number of firms shall not be less than 5% of the total number of units in each industry. Those who calculate by class and grade shall not be less than 5% of each class and grade.</p>
<p>Article 9: For industries without account books, the profit rate and other ratios may be estimated by referring to the ratio approved in the previous year and the actual business conditions and price changes in the 36th year. If there is no ratio approved in the previous year, the various ratios may be estimated by referring to the actual business conditions in the 36th year and the nature of similar industries.</p>
<p>Article 10: For profit-seeking enterprises that investigate their income based on the standard tax calculation system, if the declared income amount meets the standards set in Article 8 or Article 9, the declared income amount shall be used. If it does not meet the standard, the income shall be calculated according to the standard ratio of each industry's amount in the following provisions, and no further account verification shall be carried out. (1) For sales and manufacturing industries, if the income amount calculated based on sales is higher than the income amount calculated based on capital, the income amount shall be assessed using the sales net profit rate; if the income amount calculated based on capital is higher than the income amount calculated based on sales, the income amount shall be assessed using the capital net profit rate. (2) For industries that provide labor or credit, the income amount shall be assessed using the capital net profit rate. (3) If the sales amount is not accurate, it may be assessed using the capital turnover rate. If the revenue amount is not accurate in industries that provide labor or credit, it may be assessed using the revenue expense rate.</p>
<p>Article 11: Those who should be decided directly in accordance with the law may estimate the income amount by referring to the standard ratio in Article 8 or Article 9 and weighting it heavily.</p>
<p>Article 12: After the competent tax collection authority assesses the tax payable, it shall fill out a payment notice for the amount higher than the provisional tax amount, deliver it to the taxpayer, and pay it within ten days. If there is an overpayment, the tax shall be refunded. From the date of payment of the provisional tax amount to the day before the delivery of the refund, the refund interest shall be calculated at the interest rate of the deposit reserve of the central bank's silver and money shops, and shall be included in the tax amount to be refunded, and the refund shall be issued together. If the tax payable is equal to the provisional tax amount, the taxpayer shall be notified.</p>
<p>Article 13: If a taxpayer fails to pay taxes within the time limit, the competent tax collection authority shall send the case to the court for punishment in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Law. The court shall handle the execution of the punishment in the preceding paragraph within seven days after receiving the case.</p>
<p>Article 14: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Reports on Constitutional Preparation Work at the National Government; Proposes Improvement Suggestions for Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 2nd] Vice Chairman Sun presided over the National Government's monthly meeting on the morning of the 2nd and reported on the progress of the preparation work for the constitutional implementation process and the review of the elections. Sun first explained the government's preparation work for the implementation of the constitution, such as the revision of the organizational law of the Five Yuans and the drafting of various laws and regulations. Secondly, when reviewing the elections, he believed that because this was the first time in our country, the various laws and regulations were not prepared enough, resulting in countless disputes. Sun put forward the following three points, believing that they should be improved: (1) The register of voters should be fully prepared in advance and handled by the personnel responsible for handling household registration. The election was rushed, resulting in various malpractices. (2) The provisions in the election law regarding party nomination and signature nomination were ambiguous, resulting in today's phenomenon of intra-party competition. Later, the State Council passed supplementary election regulations, which restricted candidates nominated by political parties and signature nominations, but it was too late, making it difficult to remedy. (3) The regulations on preventing election fraud were too imperfect, resulting in disputes after the fact that could not be handled according to law.</p>

<h3>京滬麵粉存貨過剩　監委主開放北運　公務員待遇應按月依指數調整</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 2nd] The Control Yuan held a routine discussion meeting on the 2nd. Chairman Huang Fengchi discussed the treatment of public servants and educators. The suggestions of Control Committee member Miao Peicheng and others have been forwarded to the National Government by the President of the Yuan. The Yuan is scheduled to hold a monthly meeting on the morning of the 3rd, at which Committee member Yu Shude, who has returned from an investigation in Shanghai, will give an oral report on "The Investigation of the Economic Crisis in North China and Government Measures". Regarding foreign exchange and other points, the Japanese newspaper has already noted them on the 2nd. As for the "permit fee" for the export of flour to the north, Yu stated: "Although there is no such thing as a 'permit fee,' the additional demands and red tape caused by the improper implementation of the permit system are real. The Ministry of Food allocates export quotas for flour to the north to the Flour Industry Association of the Four Regions and the Gongji United Association of the Five Major Factories. These two groups then manage the distribution themselves. Northern grain merchants in Shanghai must purchase grain through these manufacturers in order to obtain export permits. The manufacturers, in order to make more profit, exploit customers, resulting in sales prices higher than the general market price. This price difference varies, with some reaching as high as 150,000. This fact is acknowledged in the price lists reported by the manufacturers, which state that the sales price of flour in Shanghai is too low, so they have to increase profits from the northern transport quota." Yu and others believe that the consequences of the permit system not only threaten the decline of the flour industry in Nanjing and Shanghai, but also shift all the burden to the vast poor consumers in North China. This is unfair and lacks purpose, and they believe that a thorough review is necessary. They have also found that the Ministry of Food's restrictions on the transport of flour to the north are too strict, and that the stock of flour in Nanjing and Shanghai is indeed excessive. In the future, the appropriate storage volume of flour in Nanjing and Shanghai should be determined, and at the same time, all restrictions on the transport to the north should be lifted, achieving two goals at once. Committee members Miao Peicheng and Li Xiaoting, who went to Shanghai with Yu to conduct the investigation, had not yet returned to Nanjing on the 2nd. Yu visited the President of the Yuan on the evening of the 2nd to report on the investigation and prepared his report for the 3rd overnight. Their formal written report will have to wait until Miao and Li return to Nanjing to collect all the materials and draft it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] At a discussion meeting held by the Control Yuan on the morning of the 2nd, the issue of the treatment of civil and military officials was discussed. It was generally agreed that treatment should be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, and the original method of distributing goods in kind should be maintained. Regarding the issue of downsizing various agencies, it was suggested that the government handle it with caution. The meeting also decided to suggest to the Legislative Yuan that it formulate organizational regulations for a National Public Servants and Educators Welfare Promotion Association. He Hanwen was designated to draft the proposal, which is expected to be formally submitted at the Control Yuan discussion meeting on Thursday.</p>

<h3>省縣自治問題另行起草通則　國府法政聯席審査會議決定</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 2nd] Regarding the implementation procedures for provincial and county autonomy, the Legal and Political Review Committees of the State Council held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd to discuss the issue. It was decided to draft separate general rules for autonomy, the principle being to first implement provincial and county autonomy, and after completing the foundations of local finance and security, to implement popular elections for provincial and county heads. The meeting on the 2nd was presided over by Chen Burei. First, the draft general rules for provincial and county autonomy, drafted by the Ministry of Interior and approved by the Executive Yuan, was submitted for discussion. Some people believed that there were two points in the implementation procedure that should be considered: A. The conditions for implementing county autonomy should be revised, that is, the conditions were too harsh, affecting the deadline for implementation, and could be deleted. B. The issue of the timing of the implementation of autonomy in provinces and counties, which was discussed at length during the meeting. Some people advocated deleting the conditions section. Secondly, regarding the order of implementation of provincial and county autonomy, the original draft stipulated that provincial autonomy would begin after county autonomy was completed. There was considerable debate during the discussion on the 2nd, and the majority advocated completing provincial autonomy first. The drafting of the Provincial Autonomy Law and the County Autonomy Law will have to wait until after the Provincial and County Representatives Conference can begin. Furthermore, this resolution will be submitted to the Review Committee for review, and then sent to the State Council for discussion, and then sent to the popularly elected Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Therefore, it is estimated that the revised general rules will be passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan sometime between June and July of this year, and the popular election of provincial and county heads will be further delayed, possibly between August and September of this year.</p>

<h3>Welcoming the Tibetan Business Delegation's Arrival</h3>
<p>The Tibetan business delegation, led by head Ji Guoba, arrived in Shanghai on the 18th via India and Hong Kong. The next day, they paid a visit to Mayor Wu. They entered Beijing yesterday to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang and relevant parties. After a short stay in Beijing, the delegation will return to Shanghai to inspect the city's industries and commerce. This delegation's arrival, undeterred by the long and arduous journey, to tour Beijing and Shanghai, is another new manifestation of the Chinese nation's sincere solidarity. As we bid farewell to the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe, we extend a warm welcome to the Tibetan business delegation.</p>
<p>The Tibetan people are members of the Chinese nation, as close as brothers and sisters. The only reason for distance is Tibet's location on the frontier, with obstructed transportation. This situation is the same as in Xinjiang. As the older brother, we are deeply concerned about the situation in Tibet. Therefore, the central government has sent personnel to Tibet several times, hoping to make the relationship between China and Tibet closer. Secretary-General Shen of the Shanghai Municipal Government was the high official who was sent to Tibet under orders at that time and has contributed greatly to strengthening Sino-Tibetan relations while residing there. However, the relationship between people depends on mutual visits. Only with mutual visits can mutual understanding be enhanced. We have long awaited the arrival of the Tibetan delegation. Now, the arrival of the Tibetan business delegation in Beijing and Shanghai will help to enhance mutual understanding between China and Tibet. We wish the delegation a pleasant and healthy stay!</p>
<p>The Tibetan business delegation's arrival at this time has even deeper meaning. Two years have passed since the end of World War II, but the world remains turbulent, and the reconstruction of a peaceful order is still an unrealized ideal. What is even more worrying is that the current superficial disputes have deeper implications. Some people already believe that the world is divided in two. If the world is really divided in two, we have repeatedly stated that this division is not a confrontation between East and West, but a confrontation between hatred and benevolence, democracy and totalitarianism. Hatred may attract more crowds, just as totalitarianism, disguised as democracy, may also attract more crowds. Although Hitlerism based on hatred and totalitarianism has been overthrown, it has been replaced by another system based on hatred and totalitarianism. We do not believe that history will repeat itself, but we must pay attention to the lessons of history. What are the lessons of history? It is that a system based on hatred and totalitarianism cannot withstand the test of history and will inevitably collapse; although it may be able to dominate for a time, like Hitler and Mussolini in the past. The arrival of the Tibetan business delegation is precisely at a time when this system based on hatred and totalitarianism is attempting to dominate. We want to remind them of historical vigilance and increase their attention. It must be known that the so-called "Shangri-La" is a "utopia" fictionalized by writers. In today's era, characterized by radio, airplanes, rockets, radar, and atomic energy, there is no longer a so-called "Shangri-La". The delegation's flight from India to Beijing and Shanghai must show that the so-called spatial distance has now been completely broken. So, in this era, how should they conduct themselves?</p>
<p>In terms of the historical and geographical relationship between Tibet and China, the relationship between China and Tibet should be even closer in the future. Tibet is surrounded by mountains, and the routes into Tibet are mostly from east to west, either through Yunnan, Qinghai, or Xikang. Therefore, in terms of geographical location, mainland China and Tibet are actually a geographical unit. Since the Xinhai Revolution, we have had the slogan of the Five Races Republic, and the relationship between the Han and Tibetan peoples is like that of brothers. Last year, the National Assembly formulated the Constitution, which stipulates that the Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People; and the nationalism of the Three Principles of the People is to seek the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation externally, and the freedom and equality of all ethnic groups that constitute the Chinese nation internally. The starting point is benevolence. Now that the delegation has arrived, it is precisely the time when our country is implementing the Constitution. We hope that when the delegation returns to the west in the future, it can bring back our expectations for the Tibetan people, so that the relationship between China and Tibet will become closer, and we can work together to build this republic of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>However, the main purpose of the Tibetan business delegation's arrival this time is to enhance Sino-Tibetan business and economic relations. It is necessary for China and Tibet to exchange what they have for what they need. What Tibet needs from us are tea, silk, and porcelain; and what it can export to us are medicinal materials and woolen goods. The purpose of this economic exchange is not only to facilitate the flow of goods, but also to enhance mutual understanding, which is especially necessary in the current international situation. However, due to the obstructed roads between China and Tibet, this exchange has been difficult to carry out, which is regrettable. What we should do is to focus on developing transportation between China and Tibet, so that future exchanges between China and Tibet can no longer bypass India. Highways and railways should be built between Kang Tibet, Qinghai and Tibet, and Yunnan and Tibet. Even if this construction requires huge amounts of money and is not easy to achieve in a short time, air transportation between China and Tibet should be planned quickly. As for trade with Tibet, the government should especially encourage it. Government trade institutions, such as the barter organization of the Central Trust Bureau, should be promoted first. However, it is said that there are artificial factors involved in the obstructed transportation between China and Tibet. Therefore, we also hope that the Tibetan authorities can understand the necessity of enhancing Sino-Tibetan relations and resolutely eliminate all artificial obstacles, so that contact between China and Tibet can become more frequent, and the feelings between the Han and Tibetan peoples can become deeper.</p>

<h3>交部儲運處　昨正式成立</h3>
<p>[Our city dispatch] The Ministry of Communications Storage and Transportation General Office was formally established at 9 a.m. on the 2nd, after Vice Minister Ling of the Ministry of Communications presided over the handover ceremony. The Executive Yuan headquarters also sent personnel to supervise the handover. The new agency was formed by merging the Executive Yuan Storage and Transportation Bureau, the Executive Yuan Shanghai Automobile Management Office, the Ministry of Communications Materials Storage and Transfer Office, and the Zhanghuabang Wharf Management Office. Chen Guangyuan is the director-general of the new office, and Zhang Yuanlun and Niu Ze are the vice directors. There are eight groups, including reception, warehousing, and transportation. Branch offices are established in Kowloon, Guangzhou, Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin. Materials factories are set up in Nanjing, Kunming, and Chongqing. The work of the new agency is to manage the loading, unloading, transportation, and storage of materials for government agencies across the country, especially the storage and transportation of foreign materials. The agency is currently entrusted with the storage and transportation of Japanese reparations materials, UNRRA continued transportation materials, U.S. relief materials, and social distribution of relief materials, so its responsibilities are very heavy. In the past, government agencies across the country handled the transportation of materials separately, resulting in a lot of waste of both manpower and materials. After the establishment of the new agency, transportation efficiency can be strengthened and the expenditure of the national treasury can be reduced.</p>

<p>China Trust Branch Manager Flies to Shanghai for Negotiations</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 2nd] Zhou Shaozeng, manager of the Taiwan Branch of the Central Trust Bureau, flew to Shanghai on the 2nd to negotiate the export of provincial products.

It is said that Chairman Wei has expressed his approval of this matter. Currently, the main consideration is whether there is a sufficient quantity of provincial products available for export.</p>

<h3>Construction of a Reservoir at Hongyanchi, Dihua</h3>
<p>The Project is Underway Amidst Snow</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 2nd] The Xinjiang Water Conservancy Bureau is currently undertaking a very large and arduous water conservancy project in the suburbs of Urumqi to open up 70,000 mu of cultivated land in northern Xinjiang. This is the Hongyanchi Reservoir, which began construction last August. The only water source in Dihua is the Urumqi River, which comes from the snow accumulated in the Tianshan Mountains. During the annual dry season, the flow rate is four cubic meters per second. From July to August, when the snow melts, combined with mountain rain, the flow rate can reach as high as 200 cubic meters per second. Therefore, when farmland needs water, the water volume is insufficient, while the winter water volume and the summer and autumn floods are allowed to flow away, which is a great pity. Hongyanchi, on the right bank of the Urumqi River, is a natural reservoir. It was slightly renovated in 1946, and the storage capacity has increased from 6 million cubic meters to 14 million cubic meters. After the current project is completed, it can reach a storage capacity of 50 million cubic meters, enough to irrigate more than double the cultivated land in Dihua. The winter climate in Xinjiang is extremely cold, making the project very difficult. Yesterday, the reporter braved the snow and drove to the construction site to visit. All the construction workers were building sheds for the future sluice tunnel. The sheds were filled with charcoal fires to maintain a temperature above 10 degrees Celsius, and special facilities were used to bake sand, stones, mud, and ash to enhance their bonding effectiveness. Wang Heting, the director of the Xinjiang Water Conservancy Bureau in charge of the project, is a young engineer. In 1936, he was sent by the League of Nations to India to conduct practical investigations of water conservancy and participate in practical work. Wang told the reporter that many water conservancy projects in India are mostly across deserts and Gobi deserts, which is similar to the future water conservancy development in Xinjiang. The Hongyanchi Reservoir being constructed today is one of the first major peaceful construction projects after Zhang Wenbai's arrival. Some of the downstream local projects that have been completed are the result of the joint efforts of the National Army soldiers stationed in Xinjiang.</p>

<h3>US Aircraft Conducts Aerial Patrol in the Yellow Sea, Soviet Union Protests to the US, Alleging the Act Infringes on the Freedom of Soviet Commercial Navigation</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] Moscow Radio revealed on the 2nd that amidst the Soviet Union's recent intensified anti-US diplomatic battle, it has formally protested against the US military activities in Iran and against the "reconnaissance flights" of US aircraft over Soviet Far East shipping.</p>
<p>The broadcast cited TASS as saying: "The Soviet Foreign Ministry sent a note to the US ambassador to the Soviet Union on the 30th of last month, protesting that US aircraft, including Flying Fortresses, flew low over Soviet merchant ships in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan for reconnaissance, sometimes threatening them with dive-bombing, infringing on the freedom of navigation of merchant ships. Soviet crew members and passengers have expressed their indignation at this. Such flights are a blatant attempt by the United States to establish control in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, far from its territorial waters. Such aerial activities can only be regarded as a manifestation of unwillingness to consider the legitimate interests of shipping by other countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the responsible authorities in the United States should instruct that there should be no more such violations."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] It is expected that the State Department is studying this Soviet protest note and drafting a statement to vehemently refute it. According to a Tokyo report, the Allied Headquarters believes that aerial patrols in the Yellow Sea are within its jurisdiction and does not believe that US aircraft patrols in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan constitute an infringement on the sovereignty of merchant ships.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Officials of the Far East Air Force refused to make any formal comments on the Soviet claim that US aerial squadrons were flying over Soviet ships in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, pointing out that the reported protest was made to the State Department, so there was no need to make any explanation. They pointed out that the Soviet Union's criticism of the occupying authorities, protesting to Washington or Moscow without notifying the responsible authorities here, has happened more than once. According to the procedure, Washington will ask the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo to submit a formal report and then reply to the Kremlin. Previously, the criticism stated that US aircraft flew over the border of the Kuril Islands. An informal explanation was made here, stating that such incidents occurred due to navigation errors or poor weather. The US has never intended to take such actions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] According to unofficial opinions here, the US government will reject the Soviet protest against US aircraft reconnoitering Soviet merchant ships over the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. The flights of US aircraft in the above-mentioned areas are part of regular aviation activities, and the Soviet Union has no legal right to protest. Why the Soviet Union made this protest is still not fully understood here, but some parties claim that the Soviet Union may be "guilty." It is recalled that unofficial sources in China have repeatedly asserted that Soviet ships have transported weapons for the Chinese Communists from Soviet-controlled ports in southern Manchuria through the Yellow River to northern Shandong. The Soviet Union's claim that US aircraft "dived" at Soviet ships seems incorrect, as such movements are not only dangerous but also do not help with reconnaissance.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador's Note to Iran Protests US Military Team's Activities in Iran, Saying They Constitute a Threat to the Soviet Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] A Truth News reporter in Tehran reported that the Soviet Union recently sent a note to the Iranian government, listing several facts to prove that US military advisors play a decisive role in Iranian military affairs and engage in guidance activities, turning Iran into a US military base. The reporter also said that the Iranian army, under the leadership of US military advisors, has obtained US military equipment, the format of which is the same as that given by the US to the Turkish army. Moreover, the weapons of the Iranian army are given by the US on a credit loan basis. In early 1947, US military advisors drafted a plan to reorganize the Iranian army, which was approved by the Iranian King and became the basis of the Iranian military structure. There is a special committee in the Iranian General Staff Headquarters, including US military advisors, who are drafting the rules of the Iranian army according to the American method. The US advisors are also drafting a plan to reorganize the Iranian Army Department, stipulating that Iranian military industry should be re-equipped according to American technology, so that it can manufacture and repair American weapons.</p>
<p>In addition, under the requirements and leadership of US advisors, a large airfield has been established in Iran, equipped with American equipment. Judging from the area of the airfield and the special interest expressed by the US advisors, it is clear that the airfield is not for Iranian aircraft. The establishment of underground oil depots in southern Iran by US representatives is also not to be ignored. In recent months, US advisors and other US representatives have arrived in Iran one after another. Moreover, US representatives are not only in the Iranian army but also participate in other Iranian institutions, especially the management of the civilian aircraft team of the Iranian Airlines, which is said to be an Iranian state-owned airline, but its main positions are occupied by US officials. It is expected that a large number of American officers and soldiers will soon arrive in Iran. The Truth News reporter also said that the facts listed by the Soviet military prove that the activities of the US aid mission in Iran may pose a danger to the Soviet border. For example, under the guidance of US military officers, fortifications are being built along the Soviet border in northern Iran. Recently, US advisors have frequently passed through areas adjacent to the Soviet Union by land and air, supposedly to inspect the Iranian army and police, but in reality, they are taking photos of the Soviet border and conducting military research. The Soviet note pointed out that the above-mentioned facts are not in line with the principles of promoting good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran. Therefore, the Soviet government requested the Iranian government to take necessary measures as soon as possible to eliminate the deteriorating situation that is being created.</p>
<h3>Iran Plans to Continue Borrowing from the United States to Purchase Weapons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 2nd] Iranian Army Minister Marshal Binai submitted a bill to the parliament, requesting authorization for the government to apply for a loan of 10 million US dollars from the United States to purchase military equipment and ammunition needed by the Iranian army. The bill has been submitted to the parliament's special committee for research. Last year in June, the United States had already loaned the Iranian government 25 million US dollars to purchase military equipment and uniforms from the US surplus materials, most of which were used to purchase equipment, and only a small portion was used to purchase weapons.</p>
<h3>General Election in Italy Scheduled for April</h3>
<p>The Constituent Assembly's Mission is Completed</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 2nd] This agency's reporter learned today that a decree will be drafted at the government meeting on Thursday, stipulating that Italy will hold political elections on April 18. The decree will also determine the date of the simultaneous meeting of the two houses of parliament. According to the new constitution, the parliamentary session must be held within 20 days after the general election, so political figures believe that the date may be set on May 8, which is the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the first Italian parliament.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 1st] The mission of the Italian Constituent Assembly has come to an end today. The Constituent Assembly must be convened by the President, Prime Minister, and more than one-third of the members jointly requesting it. This meeting was elected and established on July 2, 1946, and its last discussed case was the issue of Sicilian autonomy, which was passed with a large majority in favor.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Government in Germany Implements Reform Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] German sources with close contacts with the Soviet military headquarters expect that there will soon be a large-scale change of the main figures in the Soviet military government in Germany, and military personnel will gradually be replaced by civilians. This plan has begun to be implemented. The Soviet authorities have never announced this reform. It is said that it was started after Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Beria came to Germany last autumn. There are two purposes: 1. Gradually replace the military personnel of the Soviet military government with civilians, so as to establish a more satisfactory relationship with German officials and politicians; 2. Strengthen the influence of the Soviet Communist Party within the Soviet military government in Germany.</p>
<h3>The Truth Daily Criticizes the U.S. for Increasing Defense Spending</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] The Soviet Communist Party's "Truth Daily" reported that defense expenditures in the Soviet Union's 1948 budget have decreased, while those in the U.S. budget have increased. It claimed that this contrast demonstrates which country desires peace and which is "planning new aggression." The text published in "Truth Daily," broadcast abroad by Moscow Radio, stated that defense expenditures in the Soviet budget have decreased from 18.4% to 17%, while the U.S. budget allocates 30% for expanding military power, and that "the actual expenses are far greater than this figure."</p>

<h3>U.S. Plans Defense Program to Cope with Future Atomic Warfare</h3>
<p>Anglo-American Military Exercise Simulates Warfare in the South Pacific</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of Defense Forrestal is expected to announce soon a nationwide, permanent civil defense plan against atomic and chemical warfare. This plan may include how to broadly apply radar, how to prevent the spread of large fires, how to evacuate injured people, and whether large industrial areas should be decentralized. However, such actions will be very costly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 2nd] The U.S. Navy's Task Force 38 recently arrived in Sydney for a five-day visit and is scheduled to conduct a simulated war exercise with the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Air Force off the coast of New South Wales on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<h3>Differing Opinions Between Parties on U.S. Tax Cut Bill</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] U.S. House members will vote on the $650 million tax cut for U.S. taxpayers large and small on the 2nd, but the Senate may seek another path, advocating for a more economical plan. According to predictions from Republican House leaders, the election-year general tax cut bill proposed by the Republican House Ways and Means Committee Chairman in the committee is likely to pass with a two-to-one majority. According to Knudson's bill, personal exemptions would be increased by $100, and taxes would be reduced by 15% to 30%. To thwart the Republican plan, the Democratic Party will request that the House send the bill back to the Ways and Means Committee for redrafting.</p>

<p>HULL'S MEMOIRS</p>
<h3>Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance</h3>
<p>— Translated by our editorial office</p>
<p>A Harbinger of Doom in the 1930s</p>
<p>In the early years of the Roosevelt administration, Germany was arming, Japan was engaged in war, and Italy was preparing for conflict. The most unfortunate aspect at the time was the many disputes between the three major Western democracies—the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—which negatively impacted their relations. Immediately after entering the State Department, I realized that only by adopting a common stance could the aforementioned three countries restore reason to these belligerent nations. It would have been even better if the Soviet Union could have joined us. But in reality, disagreements and discrimination among us often outweighed coordination, presenting a dismal picture.</p>
<p>In our relations with the U.K., Foreign Secretary Simon was often the source of trouble. Ever since Japan's invasion of Manchuria, I always felt that Simon lacked a firm fundamental stance. Based on all the information received, I believed he was too considerate of the Japanese; I still think so today. When President Chang decided to rebuild our navy immediately after taking office, bringing its strength to the level limited by the treaty, Simon asked us to abandon this plan, fearing that it would trigger a naval arms race. However, he did not propose abandoning the construction of British warships that were already underway. Simon was uncooperative at the London Economic Conference. He was cold and aloof.</p>
<p>In March 1935, Simon expressed opposition to the principle of on-site international inspection of arms production, which greatly angered the President. I agreed with this principle, and Roosevelt shared my opinion. I sent a telegram to the President from Minister Wilson in Geneva on March 8, listing Simon's three reasons for opposition: inspection would reveal the critical state of British armaments to the continental countries; if Britain agreed, they would inevitably abandon their "trump card" to the French, as the French had no intention of taking a step further in this direction to establish an arms limitation treaty; and detailed publication of arms orders would provide a basis for unfair competition, to the detriment of the British arms industry.</p>
<p>The next day, March 9, the President expressed his opinion in a short note to me, considering this "an extremely important telegram. I think you should keep it aside, it may be useful in the future." He continued: "This telegram illustrates two points: first, on the grounds of supposedly weak armaments, the U.K. is unwilling to accept the principle of international public inspection of armaments. Therefore, the one move we consider necessary—applying this principle to Germany—cannot be carried out. In other words, the only practical way to keep German armaments at a mutually agreed level is to inspect Germany's arms supply, but the U.K. itself refuses inspection, essentially shattering that hope. The last section of the telegram is an open admission that the U.K. refuses to accept detailed public arms orders because it would be detrimental to their arms industry."</p>
<p>He then concluded: "The time will come when we can reveal the truth, proving that the current British government has no sincerity in limiting or reducing the current world armaments or the current world arms trade."</p>
<p>"I am frustrated."</p>
<p>In Washington, the then British Ambassador, Sir Ronald Lindsay, was difficult to deal with. His contact with Americans was limited to a small number of high society figures, most of whom opposed the Roosevelt administration. It was extremely difficult for us to make him understand our point of view. I got along much better with his more capable and amiable successors, Lothian and Halifax.</p>
<p>One of the main difficulties in dealing with the U.K. and France was that they themselves were unable to deal with each other well.</p>
<p>The dispute between the U.K. and France originated at the Paris Peace Conference. France hoped to move its strategic border to the Rhine River. It abandoned this intention in exchange for the Anglo-American guarantee treaty, but this treaty never materialized. From that time on, France felt that the U.K. and the U.S. were relying on it to resist Germany while demanding that it reduce the army used to carry out this defense. The U.K. hoped for a stronger and more prosperous Germany. France hoped that Germany's strength would be inferior to its own. Given Germany's superior industrial strength and distrust of any German government (regardless of its composition), France could not agree to any method that would bring its and Germany's armaments closer to parity. On the other hand, the U.K. did not like France occupying a dominant position on the continent, and hoped to create a balance of power in Europe, allowing its own strength to become the decisive factor, playing a pivotal role. However, France, while firmly opposing the U.K.'s view of the continent, constantly sought to establish an unbreakable security pact with the U.K. to defend against Germany.</p>
<p>One of the questions that many people will constantly raise is, given that the strength of the U.K. and France was so superior at the time, and Germany's strength was in such a state of decline, why did they allow Germany to gain the upper hand and threaten their own survival? The reason is that neither the U.K. nor France wanted to take measures to prevent war. In the U.K., isolationist sentiments were almost as strong as in the U.S. When France invaded the Ruhr area in 1923, it had tried to take preventive measures. The result was fierce opposition from the U.K., which led to the downfall of Poincaré. Since then, no French government has been willing to engage in preventive warfare.</p>
<p>Here, we face a fundamental weakness of democratic countries, a weakness that governments with significant public say cannot avoid. They enjoy all of God's abundant blessings in many ways, but unfortunately, when faced with external dangers, whether imminent or already forming a serious threat, they have always acted slowly! Simply too slow. Pure democracy was the contribution of the Athenians to civilization, but when this small country faced a certain threat from abroad, it had to hold a public vote to decide whether Athens should go to war. This lack of leadership to oppose appropriate government officials, the lack of trust, resulted in them falling into the hands of lawless aggressors, whose purpose was none other than to capture and enslave the Athenians. This weakness led to the disintegration and eventual destruction of Athenian democracy.</p>
<p>If in the 1930s, we could have given due respect to the various conflicting opinions of individuals and groups in this country and other peace-loving countries, while simultaneously striving for peaceful countries to take unified action to implement appropriate armament, I am confident that they could have demanded a showdown with the rogue nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan, thereby avoiding the most recent world war.</p>
<p>While striving to improve direct relations with the U.K. and France to increase the chances of peace in Europe, we also constantly sought to enhance the prestige of the League of Nations, converging and coinciding. The President and I were both believers in Wilson and always cherished the League of Nations. Since 1920, the two of us had repeatedly tried to maintain the League and develop its full strength through persuasion and practical action, but without success.</p>
<p>Once, the President said to me that he had considered the possibility of appointing an American ambassador to reside at the League of Nations. But in this regard, there were many obstacles. No other non-member country had such a representative; our country's various tasks at the League were being fully carried out by our minister to Switzerland. In addition, domestic isolationists would seize the opportunity to attack the government relentlessly.</p>
<p>In Europe and Asia, the threats to peace were growing stronger, but the reaction they provoked in the U.S. was the opposite of what one would expect. Logically, this threat should have made a large part of the American public more willing to unite with foreign, ideologically upright countries to apply pressure to countries that were obviously preparing for war. But in fact, they made these Americans panic and shrink back, vowing not to be involved in the affairs of the rest of the world. The beliefs of most of them were sincere, but they blindly failed to see that any major war that occurred anywhere could not but affect us in many important ways.</p>
<p>I myself, and many other officials who worked with me, constantly pointed out to our countrymen and foreign governments that the danger of undermining peace was already great and was still spreading. Even today, many people still show surprised expressions, completely unaware or forgetful of the past, loudly asking those of us who were directly responsible for foreign affairs at the time: "What were you doing in the years after 1933? Why didn't you discover the dangers that were constantly growing abroad? Why didn't you inform the American public of these dangers and the need to prepare ourselves? If isolationist views greatly hindered the discovery and understanding of these dangers and threats by America, then why didn't you bring this extremely important issue to the attention of the public?"</p>
<p>Past records provide sufficient answers to these naive questions and clamors. When the danger of aggression became increasingly apparent, I gave more than twenty speeches and statements in the first two years of my tenure in the State Department alone, issuing strong warnings in every way that the English language could express about the growing danger.</p>
<p>I continued to issue such warnings in the years that followed. I had always been very careful when preparing these public speeches. I knew that they would be widely quoted domestically, and that foreign governments would generally read the full text. They not only represented my own views but also the policies and views of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it would take several weeks to write a speech. I would call a group of important advisors to my office. I would say to them, "I am scheduled to give a speech in such and such city on such and such day, and this is what I have in mind." Then I would give them an outline of the ideas that had formed in my mind. I might have a few pages of notes in front of me, written in my apartment at some time the previous night. Next, I would ask them to offer opinions and suggestions. Finally, I would select one of my colleagues and ask him to draft a speech based on these ideas. The head of an important department simply does not have the time to draft original manuscripts every day, given the variety of important statements that must be made.</p>
<p>When the first draft of the speech was delivered, I would modify and rewrite it. Then I would distribute the draft to my advisors, asking them to write down their suggestions and additional ideas.</p>
<p>One important speech went through fifteen drafts before I gave it a final "O.K."</p>
<p>Before I gave an important speech on a certain government policy, I always sent the original manuscript to the President for his review, adhering to this principle. I often delivered it to him personally, partly because I did not want it to fall into the hands of others before he had read it, and partly because I wanted to be present while he was reading it so that I could provide explanations at any time and observe his reaction. The President would quietly read my speech, but he would often comment when he found something that particularly interested him. However, he rarely offered suggestions or criticisms, and even when he did, they were not of a fundamental nature.</p>
<p>In addition to these speeches, I continued to speak in the same tone privately with the ambassadors of major countries.</p>
<p>People certainly listened to me, but they did not pay attention. In the 1920s, I had always been a harbinger of doom in Congress, and I unexpectedly replayed that role in diplomacy in the 1930s.</p>
<h3>Indian Government to Issue Proclamation on Governance of the Dominion of India; Nehru Speech Resolves to Stop Violence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The Indian government will soon issue a proclamation announcing its policy for governing the Dominion of India. The government previously enjoyed popular support, largely because its policies were in line with Gandhi's views. Now that Gandhi has been assassinated, it is necessary to issue a proclamation stating its policies.</p>
<p>Observers believe that the composition and policies of the Indian cabinet will not change temporarily due to Gandhi's death. During the period of national mourning for Gandhi's death, differences of opinion among political leaders are expected to be resolved on their own. Left-wing and right-wing elements will cooperate for Gandhi's death, and the Indian government's upcoming proclamation will help the rapprochement of various factions in India and the improvement of relations with Pakistan. [Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the Indian Parliament today, firmly stating, "If the government does not dare to take effective measures to stop violence and hatred, then we are truly unworthy to be in the government. The tragedy of Gandhi's assassination is not the fault of one person; we are all collectively guilty. We must find ways to eliminate the atmosphere of violence and hatred that surrounds us, as this is the root of all evil forces." Representatives of all ethnic groups in Congress, whether Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, or Christian, unanimously condemned the violence against Gandhi and expressed their determination to unite to eliminate the rampant violence. When Congress convened, thousands of people marched outside the meeting hall, chanting slogans to eradicate militarized Hindu groups and overthrow Nehru's enemies. Nehru and many members of Congress participated in the ceremony of pouring Gandhi's ashes into the Ganges River before heading to the parliament.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Ashes Poured into Ganges River; Thousands of People and Officials Attend Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Gandhi's ashes were placed in a copper urn today and poured into the Ganges River. The ceremony was held in accordance with Hindu rites and lasted for over an hour. The area where the ceremony was held was surrounded by armored vehicles, forming a space 200 yards wide. Thousands of people, including several provincial leaders and hundreds of veterans, attended the ceremony. When the ashes were placed in the steel urn, hundreds of people chanted ancient Hindu scriptures. A yellow paper was pasted on the urn, with the words "My Lord" written on it. A small wreath of red and white flowers was wrapped around the top of the urn.</p>
<h3>Sharifuddin Resigns as Head of Indonesian-Dutch Peace Talks Delegation; Hatta Appoints Muslim Leader as Successor</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] It was announced today that former Prime Minister Sharifuddin of the Indonesian Republic has resigned as head of the Republic's delegation to the peace talks with the United Nations Commission of Good Offices and the Dutch delegation. Prime Minister Hatta announced that he has appointed Muslim Party leader Roem to succeed as head of the peace talks delegation.</p>
<h3>German North Sea Fortress Destroyed; Requires Seventy-Two Hours</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hamburg, 2nd] German news reports state that the British Royal Air Force is scheduled to destroy the former German North Sea fortress Heligoland Island starting at 6:00 PM standard time on Tuesday. The bombing will last for seventy-two hours, and all ships are prohibited from entering within five kilometers of the island to prevent danger.</p>
<h3>World's Largest Telescope; Satisfactory Preliminary Tests</h3>
<p>[United Press, Mount Palomar, California, 1st] The world's largest 200-inch telescope, completed after a year and a half of polishing, has undergone satisfactory preliminary tests, but several months of testing are still needed before it is officially put into use in June. The previous 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson could observe stars at a distance of 500 million light-years. The observation range of this new telescope can be doubled, and its application may result in entirely new theories about the universe.</p>
<h3>United Nations Economic and Social Council to Convene Sixth Session; Marshall Plan to Become a Major Topic of Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The United Nations Economic and Social Council is scheduled to hold its sixth session tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, the Marshall Plan, although not formally included on the agenda, will become a major topic of discussion. The Soviet bloc countries are expected to seize this opportunity to criticize it again, and Western countries are also prepared to respond. Most delegates believe that the result will not be any concrete action.</p>
<p>The election of officers after the opening tomorrow morning is likely to cause controversy. The U.S. supports Lebanese representative Malik to serve as chairman, while Polish representative Lange is backed by the Soviet Union. Lange arrived here yesterday and declared that he would still run for election, but it is reported that Malik has already obtained sufficient votes and will certainly be elected.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] There are 43 issues on the agenda of the Economic and Social Council that need to be discussed, some of which have extremely important implications for the economies of several regions of the world. The committee will seek to adjust the various agencies that distribute food and will decide whether to establish economic and social subcommittees in South America and the Middle East. In addition, the proposal submitted by Yugoslavia, requesting the return of frozen deposits in the U.S., will be discussed. Other issues that need to be discussed are the issue of "forced labor" in various countries' colonies and the issue of wage disparities between male and female workers. During the three-week meeting, the committee will address the issues of rescuing children in various countries, the status of newspapers, the publication of a declaration of human rights, and the holding of an anti-atrocity convention.</p>

<h3>Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory Strike Leads to Bloody Clashes; 77 Officials, Police, and Workers Dead or Injured</h3>
<p>Political, Military, and Police Authorities Hold Joint Press Conference to Report the Incident</p>
<p>Any Similar Incidents in the Future Will Be Met with Lethal Force</p>
<p>[Our Report] Over six thousand workers at the Shin Hsin No. 9 Cotton Mill on Macau Road, Shanghai West, went on strike suddenly at 12:40 PM on the 30th, after the factory management failed to meet their nine demands. They refused to send representatives for negotiation and locked the factory doors from the inside and out. By 2:00 PM yesterday, the city's party and government leaders used loudspeakers to persuade the workers to resume work, but to no avail. When police officers attempted to enter to quell the unrest, a large number of workers suddenly threw machine parts and bricks from the high-rise buildings, leading to a major conflict. Subsequently, military and police forces used tear gas and firearms to attack inside for half an hour before gaining entry and suppressing the disturbance. An investigation later revealed that three female workers had died, and thirty-eight male and female workers were injured. Thirty-six officials and police officers were also injured. Over a hundred suspects involved in the incident were arrested on the spot. Except for seventy-five who are being investigated, all other workers had been released by 11:00 PM that night.</p>
<p>At 10:00 PM that evening, Mayor Wu, despite being ill, held a press conference at his residence to address both domestic and foreign reporters. He was accompanied by Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping, and Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, who reported on the incident. Commander Xuan resolutely stated that if similar incidents were to occur in the future, he would order the military and police to use lethal force. Mayor Wu, attending the press conference last night, had not fully recovered and was still in pain from a waist injury. Therefore, his family placed two cushions behind his chair. During his speech, the mayor frequently held his waist, but his speech remained strong and forceful. Regarding the Shin Hsin incident, he believed that such actions were not those of ordinary workers, but rather a planned conspiracy by rioters. In the future, to protect the peaceful lives of the five million citizens, the government would use lethal force on the spot if similar incidents were to occur. Speaker Pan, representing the five million citizens of Shanghai, requested the government to immediately issue martial law to ensure the safety of life and property. Mayor Wu indicated his acceptance and said that he would, if necessary, jointly request the central government with Commander Xuan to declare Shanghai a martial law area.</p>
<p>The strike began at 12:40 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. The No. 9 factory had over six thousand workers, 90% of whom were female. Originally divided into day and night shifts, the day shift workers were supposed to leave the factory at 5:30 PM that day, but they all remained gathered without leaving. The night shift workers were supposed to start work at 8:30 PM, but around 7:00 PM, they began to clamor and demand to start work. To avoid trouble, the factory allowed them to enter. As a result, the day and night shift workers gathered in the factory. By 2:00 AM on the 31st, they sent out two hundred representatives to negotiate with the factory. Due to the large number of people and the lack of order in their speech, the factory asked the workers' representatives to select five people to be responsible for speaking. At that time, they put forward seven demands: 1. Each worker should be able to borrow two months' salary. 2. The wages deducted on November 12 should be reissued according to the index for that month (the deducted wages were for the construction of the General Labor Union). 3. The year-end bonus should be issued at 60% of last year's amount based on the December index, and 40% of this year's amount based on the January index. 4. There should be no restrictions on the duration of female workers' maternity leave, and their job numbers should not be changed. 5. The distribution of supplies should be reissued once, regardless of whether identity cards have an expiration date. 6. Two pecks of rice should be issued each month, and four pecks of rice should still be issued on behalf of the workers. 7. In the future, the factory's management of workers should be agreed upon by both labor and management. The factory stated that, apart from the distribution of coal briquettes, which was already being handled, the rest of the demands were unacceptable. The negotiations ended without result. All the workers remained in the factory, which by yesterday had lasted for three days. During this period, although the Social Affairs Bureau sent Mediation Section members Zhu Guilin and Gu Lijun, and Workers' Welfare Committee member He Jian to mediate, the workers' attitude was very firm. In addition to the seven demands, they added two more: 1. One day off per week with full pay. 2. Workers dismissed after January of last year should be reinstated. Zhu and others' mediation yielded no results and were even regarded as "running dogs" of the capitalists, and the situation gradually deteriorated. On the 31st, Huang Chaobin, Deputy Director of the Putuo Police Sub-Bureau, entered the factory with two plainclothes police officers to mediate, but they were detained by the workers for a day.</p>
<p>Seditious Slogans Discovered</p>
<p>At the same time, seditious slogans were found on the walls of factories near the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory, such as "Welcome university students to help," "All cotton mills act in unison," "Factories in the Shanghai East District have also gone on strike," etc. A portion of the workers also shouted and threw stones at the entrance of the Tongyi Cotton Mill next to the No. 9 factory, inciting them to join the strike. By 6:00 AM yesterday, the authorities believed that the workers' group was too complex, and sent a large number of police officers from the Putuo Road Police Sub-Bureau and motorcycle squads to the factory to be on guard. Upon seeing the arrival of the police, the workers had already retreated behind the third iron gate and locked it. After the police arrived, they persuaded the workers to send representatives to negotiate, but the workers ignored them, resulting in a stalemate. By noon, the Garrison Headquarters also sent the Garrison Brigade to assist. Police Commissioner Yu Shuping and Chief of the Investigation Section of the Garrison Headquarters Tao Yishan personally rushed to the scene, and, along with Social Affairs Bureau representative Gu Lijun, General Labor Union representative Zhang Zhusan, and Workers' Welfare Association representatives Lu Yinchu and Fan Caiqiu, used loudspeakers to broadcast to the workers, persuading them to send representatives to discuss a reasonable solution. However, the workers still showed no indication and had prepared a large amount of bricks, wooden sticks, iron tools, and corrosive liquids on the roof to prevent the police from entering. The stalemate continued until 4:30 PM, when the workers split into two factions. One faction expressed willingness to send representatives out for negotiation. The police immediately tried to pry open the door lock to allow the representatives to go out. Unexpectedly, another faction of workers in the factory rioted and shouted in opposition.</p>
<p>Attacking the Military and Police from Above</p>
<p>At this time, a large amount of bricks, iron rods, and corrosive liquids were thrown down from the factory and canteen rooftops. For a moment, debris flew everywhere, and the order was in chaos. Yan Zi, the Second Company Commander of the Garrison Brigade, and four police officers from the Putuo Sub-Bureau were dragged into the workshop by the workers, who seized their guns, punched, and kicked them, causing them serious injuries. They were later rescued by other police officers who risked their lives to rush in. At this time, about forty workers who did not want to be coerced took the opportunity to escape. Eighteen worker representatives who led the incident were captured and dragged out by the police. Amidst the chaos, the workers on the factory roof continued to throw iron bars, wooden blocks, corrosive liquids, and machine parts down, and sprayed with tap water. The police officers retreated slightly and immediately telegraphed headquarters to send additional security police, armored vehicle teams, flying fortresses, and criminal police to assist.</p>
<h3>Suppressing the Riot, Order to Open Fire; A Large-Scale Attack Under Searchlights</h3>
<p>At 5:45 PM, Commander Xuan, Liu Chang, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping, and Chief of the Investigation Section Tao Yishan, accompanied by Commander Xuan, walked to the garrison vehicle parked at the second iron gate and reported the details of the workers occupying the roof, pouring corrosive liquids, and throwing bricks and ironware. At that time, motorcycle squad police officers attempted to use the cover of small armored vehicles. The workers on the roof saw the police action and immediately resisted. Bricks, wooden sticks, circular iron barrels, and long benches flew down. At the same time, they secretly sprayed water. The police officers were unable to advance and had to retreat to their original positions. Commander Xuan was furious at the sight and said to Commissioner Yu, "In this situation, the only option is to open fire. Anyone who resists will be killed without exception. I will take full responsibility." He instructed: first, use tear gas to force the workers to retreat, then rush in to occupy the roof and find a way to surround them.</p>
<p>Commissioner Yu, upon receiving the order, immediately gathered the security police brigade and the motorcycle squad to prepare for the attack. All officers and police held batons in their right hands and guns in their left. Commissioner Yu instructed that they should not open fire unless their lives were in danger. After the preparations were completed, an elderly police officer fired more than a dozen tear gas shells at the roof. In an instant, smoke filled the air, and shadows flickered. Gunshots rang out loudly, and the police officers shouted and charged forward, using the searchlights on the garrison vehicles to attack the platform room directly facing the gate. Commissioner Yu ordered the bugler next to him to blow the charge, and a part of the police officers climbed the roof from the ladders built by the carpenters outside the restaurant that was under construction, stopping the workers from throwing bricks. At that time, gunshots, bugle calls, and shouts intertwined into one.</p>
<p>Arson Attempt Failed</p>
<p>The workers in the factory saw the police entering with overwhelming force and knew that they could not resist. They fled backward in succession. A few thugs attempted to set the factory on fire. Fortunately, fire engines arrived in time and cooperated with the attack, foiling their sinister plan. By 6:30 PM, the initial attack had come to an end, and the roof of the restaurant and platform room was under police control. Commander Xuan saw that the police had rushed in and left in a hurry. Before leaving, he instructed the person in charge, "Rush in and try to concentrate the workers, then surround them, search them, and find a way to deal with them." At 6:37 PM, the charge was sounded again, and gunshots were dense. Commissioner Yu personally commanded and launched another attack. Subsequently, reinforcements from the security police arrived, and the police had an absolute advantage. The garrison vehicles approached step by step with the vanguard. There were no workers in sight where the bright lights shone. However, shouts still came from the factory in the back. It was reported from time to time that the entire factory was under police control, at 6:54 PM.</p>
<p>Commissioner's Speech</p>
<p>Most of the workers were kind-hearted but were being used by a small number of people. After this battle, they were all panicked. The elderly female workers were trembling and unable to walk. Some knelt on the ground and begged, while others covered their faces and shouted grievances, all claiming that they were forced to participate in the strike and knew nothing about the conditions put forward to the capitalists. In order to search for the seized guns, the police ordered male and female workers to raise their hands and form single lines, file out, be inspected one by one, and be escorted to the large lawn in front of the factory. Commissioner Yu gave a speech. Many of those who threw bricks at the police, robbed guns, destroyed machines, and attempted arson were identified and immediately arrested. Commissioner Yu's speech roughly said: "The guns we fired today were aimed at the sky, so no one was killed. You have more than three million yuan in salaries and allowances each month, which is half as much as my commissioner's salary. Yet, you still cause trouble and create a catastrophe. Your violent resistance to the government and beating of the police are completely the actions of rioters. But today I will only deal with the ringleaders, and you can all go home (the workers cheered and thanked the commissioner). I hope that in the future, you will consider the difficulties of the capitalists, maintain the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, and not be used by others again, and work hard." After Commissioner Yu finished speaking, he began to check them one by one, until everyone was released by 11:00 PM. At the same time, the police went to various workshops and platforms to search for male and female workers who were trying to hide, but the five seized handguns were never found.</p>
<p>Commander Xuan arrived at the factory again around 8:00 PM, personally inspected the premises, and instructed factory manager He to investigate the extent of the losses.</p>
<p>Examination of the Three Female Corpses</p>
<p>After 11:00 PM, prosecutors Chen Shoutao and Ding Tongjun from the District Procuratorate, accompanied by forensic doctor Gong Ziwei, went to Shin Hsin to investigate and examine the three female corpses. One of the deceased, Wang Huamei, was a female worker in the small packaging room of the Shin Hsin No. 9 factory. She suffocated to death from being squeezed by the crowd during the chaos. Another, Zhu Yunxian, fell to her death after losing her footing while running at a height. The other died from a gunshot wound, but her name could not be found until late at night.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Stock Prices Decline Under the Influence</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday's stock market saw a decline in cotton mill stock prices due to the brewing and uncertain labor unrest at Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory, and its tendency to worsen. Generally, those holding cotton mill stocks felt the crisis of the cotton mill's future and sold off their shares, resulting in an overflow of cotton mill stock chips. In the morning, Yongxin briefly saw a low price of 660 yuan. Before the close in the afternoon, it showed a slight recovery due to the loosening of credit.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Holds Press Conference for Chinese and Foreign Reporters at His Residence; Top Officials Attend to Report the Incident; Speaker Pan Requests Declaration of Martial Law</h3>
<p>Following the Shin Hsin incident, at 10:00 PM that evening, Mayor Wu, despite being ill, convened reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers at his residence to make a statement. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping, and Commander Xuan Tiewu reported on the incident. City Councilor Speaker Pan also expressed his opinions. Attendees at the press conference included newspaper publishers, editors-in-chief, Committee Member Fang, Tao Yishan, Lu Jingshi, the manager of Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory, and directors from relevant bureaus and departments, totaling approximately sixty people. The discussions lasted until 11:30 PM. After the meeting, the Mayor continued to hold a meeting with Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, and others to discuss future security issues.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Staff Were Detained; Confirmed to Be Communist Agitation</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the press conference, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian reported on the causes and developments of the labor unrest. The labor unrest at the factory began on the 30th, with workers suddenly organizing a patrol team to force all workers in the factory to stop working and cut off internal and external transportation. However, no conditions were put forward to the capitalists beforehand. Afterwards, the Social Affairs Bureau sent staff member Zhu Guilin to mediate, but he was detained by the workers and confined inside the factory for twenty-four hours. The factory manager was also confined for three days. Workers inside the factory could not leave without the permission of the patrol team. The seven demands put forward by the workers afterwards had many conflicts with laws and regulations. The factory could not accept them, and the government could not recognize them. In November of last year, the government obtained intelligence that the Communist Party had orders to launch a struggle for the year-end bonus in Shanghai, using the issue of the year-end bonus as a tool. Knowing this intention, the government quickly resolved the year-end bonus issues in various factories. To date, more than 90% have been resolved. The Communist Party, knowing that the New Year's bonus struggle at the end of the Gregorian calendar had failed, launched a struggle for wage advances at the end of the Lunar calendar. The Lunar New Year wage advance movement at Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory was confirmed to be Communist agitation. When the situation became serious, realizing that it was not an ordinary labor-capital dispute, the Mayor Wu was reported, and it was necessary to ask the police to assist in the resolution.</p>
<h3>Pre-Planned Steps, Eventually Resorting to Force</h3>
<p>Subsequently, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping reported on the riot, stating that nine-tenths of the factory's seven thousand workers were female workers, and the remaining one-tenth were male workers. Most of the workers were unwilling to participate. Many female workers were crying in the factory. Before handling the incident, the military and police discussed and decided on three steps: First, representatives from various agencies broadcasted persuasions. Second, representatives from various agencies entered the last door to persuade them. If the above two steps did not work, then they would try to use force to occupy the last gate. After occupying the last gate, they would broadcast again to persuade the workers who were willing to leave to be allowed to leave the factory. After the steps were decided, they were implemented step by step. After persuasion failed and a stalemate lasted for one or two hours, the workers first requested the military and police to withdraw to the gate before sending two representatives to the last gate and agreeing to cut open the door chain. When the worker representatives walked out after cutting open the door chain, the workers ambushing on the roof, perhaps misunderstanding that the military and police were arresting the representatives, threw down wooden sticks, bricks, glass shards, corrosive liquids, iron cones, oil drums, and other things that had been prepared, and the conflict began. Because the workers occupied high positions and threw down corrosive liquids and other objects, the troops could not advance. Later, Commander Xuan arrived and felt that it was no longer possible to reason, so he decided to send troops to occupy the high rooftops and planned to use minimal weapons to control the crowd. And because the rioters occupied the roof, in order to disperse them, the police were ordered to fire into the sky to intimidate them, and tear gas was used to suppress the workers clamoring on the ground, with armored vehicles rushing in at the front to break through. Only then was it suppressed. During the conflict, more than 30 police officers were injured, and three were seriously injured. Three workers died, two of whom died of suffocation after being trapped inside for three or four days without food, and one had blood on his head and was being examined by a forensic doctor. More than 30 other workers were injured, and five were seriously injured.</p>
<p>Commander Expresses Determination to Eliminate Evil</p>
<p>Commander Xuan followed Commissioner Yu and also reported on the handling of the matter yesterday. Finally, he firmly announced, "If similar incidents occur again in the future, they will be dealt with in the most severe manner. When necessary, military and police will be ordered to open fire to stop them, killing without exception." Xuan said that the military and police repeatedly tried to find a solution through peaceful means yesterday, but were ultimately rejected by the workers, which was utterly unreasonable. He also said: Unfortunate incidents have occurred repeatedly in Shanghai in the past five days, which is a cause for concern about social order. Each time an incident occurs, the authorities have tried to deal with it through peaceful means, but there are too many troublemakers, and riots are unavoidable. Therefore, if today's matter is not resolved, it may spread to other factories, and Shanghai will become an unmanageable situation. I bear the primary responsibility for maintaining security and will not allow a small number of thugs to undermine the safety of five million citizens.</p>
<p>People Have the Right to Demand Government Protection</p>
<p>Speaker Pan said: Standing in the position of a participant in the meeting, I believe that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau handled the Shin Hsin incident appropriately. In particular, the guidelines announced by Commander Xuan for the future are also necessary. The other day, Mayor Wu was beaten and humiliated by students from Tongji University, but he still showed great restraint and ordered no one to open fire. The Mayor should have done this out of love for the students. But I was worried at the time that an ordinary citizen violated the law and humiliated the mayor. If this situation is not strictly stopped, it is extremely dangerous. Sure enough, the next day there was an incident of the Social Affairs Bureau being vandalized. I was present at the time and did not see any representatives sent to negotiate. And today's matter shows even more the riotous behavior of thugs. If this continues, how can the citizens of Shanghai live and work in peace? Therefore, in the future, strict measures must be used to stop them. I absolutely agree with the warning announced by Commander Xuan.</p>
<p>The Speaker further stated that if the government does not make a decision to maintain local stability, then not only Shanghai but other places will also experience unrest. Shanghai is an international city, an economic center, and China's first port. The Communists are using various methods to destroy it. Why doesn't the government declare martial law here? We have the right to demand government protection. In this situation, if opening fire is still not allowed, then what is the use of the military and police? This is a mistake, and this mistake cannot continue to exist. We want to ask the Mayor and Commander Xuan to request instructions from the central government to declare Shanghai a city under martial law.</p>
<h3>Hai Zhe Vessel Arrives in Port; Japanese Compensation Materials; Currently Unloading; 681 Crates of Machinery Delivered</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhe vessel, the second vessel to return to Shanghai carrying compensation materials from Japan, docked at the Zhanghuabang Wharf at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. Representatives from various relevant departments were on site to jointly open the holds. The unloading work was still handled uniformly by the General Storage and Transportation Office of the Ministry of Communications and is expected to be completed in two days. In addition to carrying 681 crates of machine tools (including parent machine tools such as planers and drills), the vessel also brought three overseas Chinese travelers to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fire at Shandong Middle Road [Our Report] A fire broke out at the Yichang Handkerchief Factory at No. 156 Shandong Middle Road, at the intersection of Jiaotong Road, at 11:00 AM yesterday. In addition to the factory's workshop at Nos. 76 and 74 Jiaotong Road being destroyed, the fire also spread to Xinhua Bookstore at No. 160 Shandong Middle Road. The fire was completely extinguished by the fire brigade after two hours.</p>
<p>Chu Linxun's Treason Case Still Sentenced to One Year and Three Months</p>
<p>The case of Chu Linxun, Director of Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, for collaborating with the enemy has been concluded after a retrial by the High Court. The sentence was announced yesterday, still sentencing him to one year and three months of imprisonment. The defendant was allowed to be released on bail under his original guarantor.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe to Leave Shanghai; All Circles Hold Farewell Reception</h3>
<p>The Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Visiting Troupe will visit Taiwan in the near future. As they are about to leave Shanghai, all circles in the city specially held a farewell reception at the New Life Club at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to express their farewell. Shen Zonglian presented medals on behalf of Mayor Wu. The recipients included workers like Yimin and Kang Ba'erhan. Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, and others also presented commemorative medals to all members of the troupe.</p>
<h3>The Three Major Events Are Interrelated; Clearly a Planned Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Hope That Citizens Will Not Be Used by the Communist Party</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu, despite his illness, stood up to address the audience, believing that the government had two tasks: one was to care for good citizens and enable them to live and work in peace, and the other was to eliminate violent elements and prevent them from harming the people. In short, it was to eliminate evil and ensure the safety of the people. Recently, three incidents have occurred in Shanghai within five days: on the 29th of last month, I was beaten and humiliated during the student unrest, on the 31st, the Social Affairs Bureau was vandalized, and today, there was labor unrest. These three events may seem unrelated on the surface, but they are actually interconnected. Recently, the Communist Party organized a "National Riot Movement Committee," with Zhou Enlai as chairman. There is a command structure in the Yangtze River basin, and Shanghai is of course its central target. During the Tongji student unrest, I can guarantee that most of the students were used, and a few were instructed by the Communist Party to deliberately force the government to open fire. When this goal was not achieved, there were continued incidents of vandalizing the Social Affairs Bureau and causing labor unrest. I myself can be beaten, but I do not want to open fire for no reason and harm innocent citizens. Even with the Social Affairs Bureau being vandalized, Commander Xuan and I still advocated avoiding bloodshed as much as possible. After being beaten and humiliated during the Tongji student unrest, I received many letters from citizens advocating that when similar incidents occur again, they should be suppressed by opening fire. Today, during the Shin Hsin labor unrest, workers wielded corrosive liquids and dismantled machinery, using them as weapons along with stones and iron buckets. Such actions cannot be regarded as ordinary workers and are clearly a planned conspiracy by thugs. Only force can be used against thugs. The government has reached the end of its tolerance, so I fully agree with Commander Xuan's opinion, warning the good citizens of Shanghai not to be used by the Communist Party. In the future, if similar events occur again, lethal force will be used on the spot. In order to protect the peaceful lives of the five million citizens, the government has to use force. Having given a warning in advance, the government will not be responsible if the military and police open fire during future riots. I hope that the citizens understand the government's suffering in enduring this and agree with this opinion. I fully accept Speaker Pan's opinion representing the views of five million citizens. If necessary, I will definitely join Commander Xuan in requesting the central government to declare temporary martial law in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Roaming Zhoushan Area, Gang of Thieves Arrested in Shanghai, Bandit Leader Knows Water Well, Boasts That He Had Three Near-Death Experiences</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Zongpin, the notorious bandit and pirate leader who has been rampant in the Zhoushan, Zhenhai, Fenghua, and Quanshan areas for years, and his accomplices Shi Xiangsheng, Zhang Yueqing, and Zhang Lizhong, etc., have been apprehended by the Yulin Police and Investigation Bureau. This group of thieves came to Shanghai intending to organize a naval detachment, but they fell into the police net, eliminating a major scourge for the coastal people.</p>
<p>Bandit Liu is from Gaoting, Haidai Mountain, and is twenty-six years old this year. He is short in stature, accurate with a gun, and very knowledgeable about water. He usually recruits soldiers and buys horses, and organizes self-defense forces without authorization, accumulating wealth in the Zhejiang sea, threatening fishermen and merchants. Among them, the robbery of the Huaan ship on April 9, 1936, caused the greatest damage. In addition, he committed numerous crimes such as kidnapping for ransom, murder, and theft. According to Liu, after being arrested, he confessed: "I have escaped death three times. This time, dying in Shanghai is a peaceful death. The first time was in 1935 when I was arrested in the Zhoushan Islands. The county government sent four people to escort me to the beach for execution. As soon as we reached the beach, I jumped into the water and swam away. The second time was in 1936 when I was arrested in Dinghai. The county government used a speedboat to take me to the sea for execution. At that time, my feet were cut with a knife, making it impossible to walk, but I still seized the opportunity to jump into the sea, hid under the boat for half an hour, and then escaped. The third time was in a massacre, but I was lucky to escape because I happened to be in Ningbo."</p>

<p>Twenty-Eight Dance Halls Resume Business Last Night</p>
<h3>Six Hundred and Eighty-One Arrested Dancers and Staff Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Of the 797 dance hall staff and dancers arrested during the Social Affairs Bureau crackdown, 681 were released on bail by the various sub-bureaus before 12:00 noon yesterday after initial interrogation. All twenty-eight dance halls in the city resumed business starting last night.

<p>Red-Clad, Scarred-Faced Woman Has Fled Without a Trace</p>
<p>The scarred-faced woman in red who assaulted Director Wu during the incident has eluded capture. After two days of intensive investigation by the police bureau, Tan Peiwu (also known as Ellis) from the Liderer Dance Hall was found to have a strong resemblance and was suspected of involvement. However, after identification, it was determined that she was not the person. It is now known that the assailant has fled, and the police bureau is determined to arrest her and bring her to justice. In addition, Mayor Wu has ordered generous compensation for the police officers injured in the incident, with a reward of one million yuan for those with minor injuries and two million yuan for those with serious injuries.</p>
<p>Attempted Arson Foiled, Burnt Abacus Discovered</p>
<p>It is reported that after the Social Affairs Bureau was vandalized by the dancers and staff, the losses were significant. Various departments continued to register damaged items yesterday. Director Wu first requested the city government to allocate 5 billion yuan for repairs and replacements, which was approved by Mayor Wu, with 2 billion yuan allocated first and the remainder to be allocated successively. After the damaged rooms were cleaned up, the broken doors and windows were temporarily covered with wooden boards and newspapers, but cold wind constantly blew in. The office desks, chairs, and utensils in the rooms were all incomplete and pieced together. The staff continued to work as usual in difficult conditions. The door to the Deputy Director's office was broken through, and one could simply step straight in without opening the door. One leg of the Deputy Director's desk was missing and temporarily propped up with a wooden strip. The white porcelain urinal and flush toilet in the Labor-Management Arbitration Council office were also smashed with wooden sticks. None of the windows in the room had glass. In addition to temporarily covering them with newspapers, bamboo curtains used in the summer were also hung to block the cold wind. A large charred area was found on the floor of the Arbitration Council office. Secretary Gu Zusheng also found a burnt abacus in the room. It is said that during the chaos on the 31st, the vandals placed sofas, paper, and other items on charcoal basins in an attempt to set a fire, but it was extinguished by firefighters, averting a major disaster.</p>
<p>Detailed Recording of Damage to Each Floor</p>
<p>The Food Section of the Economic Administration Department, which suffered the heaviest losses, had staff yesterday still searching through piles of paper for various receipts and account books, sorting and organizing them. The staff of the Industrial and Commercial Registration Section were busy sorting through the scattered and messy registration cards. As a result, the section has temporarily suspended registration work from yesterday, but the work of accepting application forms and issuing completed licenses will continue as usual. It is estimated that the work of sorting out the registration cards will take three days.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, expressing gratitude to Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang and Prosecutor Quan Tao for personally inspecting the scene after the bureau was vandalized. It also requested that the instigators be severely punished according to the law, and that evidence would be submitted after it was collected. Prosecutor Quan said that a detailed record of the damage to each floor had been made during the inspection, and that the cause of the incident would be carefully investigated. Relevant personnel will be summoned for questioning at that time.</p>
<p>Condolences from All Sectors</p>

<h3>Huazhong Transportation Terminal, Hub of Jianghu Connections, Prospects for Chenglingji Port</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Changsha, 1st] Chenglingji is a port eight kilometers northeast of Yueyang, on the east bank of Dongting Lake. The Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Feng rivers of Hunan province all flow into Dongting Lake, and Chenglingji is the gateway for Hunan's goods. It is also where the Yangtze River merges, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, including Sichuan, western Hubei, and northern Guizhou, are the port's hinterland. It is a hub of transportation in the Jianghu region, with an upstream drainage area of 670,000 square kilometers and abundant products such as rice, tea, tung oil, medicinal materials, and minerals. Therefore, Chenglingji is Hunan's ideal inland river port. Now that the Yuehan Railway is open, if a six-kilometer railway can be built from Chenglingji to connect with the Yuehan Railway, the products of that vast hinterland can be transported directly to Guangzhou through the port and exported overseas, saving time and money. In the past, the wharf at Chenglingji was at Guihuahui, which was very small, and due to years of siltation, many goods had to be transported through Wuhan to Shanghai, a waterway of more than 1,500 kilometers. There is also the trouble of reloading in Wuhan, and Shanghai's port also feels congested. Therefore, the construction of Chenglingji Port is of great importance to the economic development of the hinterland.</p>
<p>Planning to Develop a Port</p>
<p>The Hunan Provincial Government, recognizing the importance of Chenglingji, is now planning to develop it into a port, and has hired Li Rongmeng as an engineer to draft a construction plan. The planned project will be carried out in two phases: the first phase will be to build a revetment wharf and two machine bridges between Liugong Temple and Shuhuatang at the northern end of Chenglingji, and to utilize the funds first. The second phase will be to build three dry docks between Guihuayuan and Qilishan at the southern end of Chenglingji, all with compound boat locks. A six-kilometer railway will be laid from the riverbank to connect with the Chenglingji Station of the Yuehan Railway, and an eight-kilometer highway will be built to connect with Yueyang County. Loading and unloading equipment will be installed between the deep-water line of the Yangtze River and Chenglingji, and freight yards and warehouses will be built for use. Nearby, industrial, commercial, and residential areas will be developed, so that processing and manufacturing, and trade operations can be developed accordingly. Schools, hospitals, residences, roads, and other municipal constructions can also be planned at will.</p>
<p>According to the above plan, the cost of materials and labor is estimated to be 1,155,000 yuan according to pre-war currency values. The Hunan Provincial Government plans to start construction immediately. The funding methods, in addition to the railway and highway being handled separately by the Yuehan Railway Bureau and the Provincial Highway Bureau, the warehouses, lighters, and cranes will be contracted by merchants, and other projects will be built by borrowing money. It is estimated that after the completion of the project, there will be a throughput of 2 million tons. At a pre-war currency value of 50 yuan per ton, the total value of goods imported and exported annually is about 100 million yuan. One percent of various port fees will be drawn, which is 1 million yuan. After deducting management fees, the investment capital can be used to repay all the funds within two years.</p>
<p>After the completion of Chenglingji Port, goods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the areas through which the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Feng rivers flow can be transferred to the Yuehan Railway for export from Chenglingji. The waterway from Chenglingji to Shanghai is 1,500 kilometers, while the land route to Guangzhou is only 800 kilometers. After the construction of the port, the transportation distance can be reduced by 47%, and the time can be reduced from seven days to five days. Transportation costs: currently, the cost from Chenglingji via Hankou to Shanghai is 1.22 million yuan per ton, while the cost from Yueyang to Guangzhou is only 570,000 yuan per ton. Therefore, after the completion of Chenglingji Port, transportation costs can be reduced by 53%.</p>
<p>The Yuehan Railway was originally a north-south artery south of the Yangtze River, and the Guangdong Provincial Government is also actively developing Huangpu Port. In the future, the development of Huangpu Port must rely on the economic development along the Yuehan Railway in order to have a large amount of cargo to transport and throughput. In terms of the Yuehan Railway line, Changsha Chongyang and other places are not suitable for building ports. However, in recent years, the siltation of the Xiang River and Dongting Lake has prevented them from connecting with the main channel of the Yangtze River. Only Chenglingji is located at the confluence of the rivers and lakes, is closest to the Yuehan Railway, and has the convenience of connecting water and land transportation.</p>
<p>When Hubei and Hunan are rich, the whole country is sufficient. Hunan province is indeed a region rich in products. It is a pity to abandon goods on the ground due to transportation issues. Once Chenglingji Port is completed, the Yangtze River and the Yuehan Railway, two waterways and land transportation routes, can be connected. During the flood season, 1,000-ton steamships can reach Yichang directly, and 500-ton ships can go up to Chongqing. If going downstream, 10,000-ton ships can reach Beijing and Shanghai. The Yuan and Zi rivers will be dredged, so that 200-ton to 500-ton ships can travel smoothly, so that they can reach northern Guangxi in the south and western Guizhou in the west. Soon we will see ships gathering and various goods gathering, all waiting for Chenglingji Port to transport them. Currently, the Chenglingji Port construction project is still in preparation, revealing a grand and beautiful prospect. When this imagination becomes a reality, not only will Yueyang County benefit, and Hunan Province will benefit, but the people of western Hubei, northern Guangxi, northern Guizhou, Sichuan, and even eastern Xikang will also benefit a lot. At the same time, the economic situation in Central China will have a new look. (Luo Sen)</p>

<h3>Railway Bandit Surrenders to Justice</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, January 31] Theft cases on the Jinghu train have occurred repeatedly, and robberies are often heard. Although the Railway Bureau has taken strict precautions, theft cases cannot be eliminated. Wang Decai, from Xuzhou, is 26 years old, with a burly figure, extraordinary strength, and good at swimming. He has been rampant on the railway for many years, committing numerous crimes. During the enemy and puppet period, he was captured by the enemy military police, but he used his party ties to overthrow the enemy military police and fled without a trace. After the victory, he worked for the Nanjing Transportation Company, while still engaging in theft on the railway. The Railway Bureau's Jingwu Office issued a wanted order, but failed to capture him. The Nanjing Jiangbian Station discovered the Nanjing Transport Company the day before yesterday. The Transportation Company had a dispute with the loading and unloading workers over handling fees, resulting in a big fight. The old man of the Transportation Company was incredibly strong, and many of the workers were no match for him. Many passers-by stopped to watch. The Jiangao Station police received the news and sent several policemen to bring both sides to the station for questioning. It turned out that the incredibly strong old man of the Transportation Company was Wang Decai, the notorious thief on the Jinghu line who had committed numerous crimes. He revealed his true name in his confession due to being carried away by his momentary success. The police station was very excited to learn that he was the railway bandit who had been wanted for a long time, and immediately escorted him to the Railway Police Office. Huang Yangsun, the squad leader of the Railway Criminal Police Team, personally interrogated him and showed him the wanted order. Wang Decai then realized that he had revealed his true identity and remained silent. Sun Shaotang, Wang Baoneng, and Peng Lin, who were arrested at the same time, will be prosecuted severely.</p>

<h3>Allowances for Public Educators in Bian City – Telegraph Request to Central Government for Upgrade to First Tier</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Kaifeng, 26th] The Executive Yuan recently stipulated that Kaifeng should be classified as the third tier and Henan Province as the fourth tier in the zoning system for adjusting the allowances of public educators. Upon hearing this, all agencies were greatly alarmed, believing that this matter of personal concern was more serious than the Kowloon demolition incident. They gathered to discuss the matter, with the teachers and staff of various middle schools taking the lead. They had previously requested the central government to upgrade Kaifeng to the first tier, as detailed in previous reports. It has now been learned that the following are also responding: The Liaison Association of Central Agencies stationed in Bian City held its inaugural meeting at the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau. Leaders from various agencies, including Guo Zhongwei, Chen Panling, Yan Huatang, Zhou Yuzi, and Sun Mingcheng, along with over 800 employee representatives from 28 units, attended. They resolved that the soaring prices in Bian City were no less than those in Beijing and Shanghai. The decision to classify the city in the third and fourth tiers for allowance adjustments caused widespread unrest. Under the leadership of Guo Zhongwei, the Henan Supervisory Commissioner, they jointly appealed to the central government to raise the tier. The original telegram is as follows: "To President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, the news of the adjustment of allowances for public servants brings momentary relief amidst hunger and thirst. The province of Yu is rife with Red peril, with hardly any pure land left. Kaifeng faces threats from all sides, which have not yet been eliminated. Traffic is cut off, and prices are soaring. The current cost of living exceeds that of Nanjing, and prices continue to rise. The facts are undeniable and can be easily verified. However, employees of central agencies stationed in Bian City receive no in-kind benefits like those in Beijing and Shanghai, nor do they receive subsidized public grain like those in provincial-level agencies. The public is uneasy and apprehensive; how can we provide reassurance? We earnestly request that you consider our hardships and adjust the allowances according to the first-tier index to maintain our livelihood and facilitate our work. Representing the heads of central agencies stationed in Bian City, Guo Zhongwei, Chen Panling, Yi Tianjue, Zhou Yuzi, Yao Congwu, Wang Peisan, Li Yongji, and Sun Minghe respectfully." The Henan Provincial Government believes that classifying the province as the third tier in the adjustment of public educators' allowances does not match the actual cost of living. Furthermore, the province has recently experienced serious banditry and traffic congestion, with the prices of daily necessities such as cloth and sundry goods exceeding those of Beijing and Shanghai. It has telegraphed the central government to consider the hardships of public servants in the province and revise the classification to the first tier. It has also telegraphed Meng Zhaozan, the Director of the Provincial Department of Finance stationed in Nanjing, to personally present the situation to the Executive Yuan. The Kaifeng City Education Association believes that classifying the cost of living for public educators in Henan as the third and fourth tiers is inconsistent with the actual situation. It has telegraphed the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Executive Yuan's Accounting Office, requesting a revision to the first tier. The original telegram is as follows: "Upon reading the newspaper, we learned that the adjustment of allowances for public educators in Bian and Yu has been classified as the third and fourth tiers, which is truly unsettling. Since late December of last year and January of this year, prices in Yu have been rising rapidly and drastically. The daily necessities of life are extremely expensive. Public educators are largely impoverished, facing the hardships of supporting their families and experiencing the bitterness of hunger and cold. Their inability to obtain a full meal all day long and their difficulty in adding even half a thread of clothing throughout the year cannot be adequately described in words. If the adjustment is made according to the third and fourth tiers, public educators in Bian and Yu will face a situation where everyone feels insecure and unable to sustain themselves. At a time when the nation is facing difficulties and war is raging, we earnestly request that you alleviate our plight and help us overcome these difficulties together. We request that you allow the adjustment of Bian and Yu to be classified as the first tier, so that public educators can continue to persevere. We are anxiously awaiting your orders."</p>

<h3>Guangfeng Faces Severe Grain Shortage; Appeals for Exemption from Grain Procurement; Representatives Elected to Petition the Provincial Government</h3>

<h3>The Gou People of Southern Zhejiang Lead a Migratory Life</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nengquan, 1st] Shiitake mushrooms are a top-grade vegetarian delicacy, with a flavor that surpasses even chicken, duck, fish, and meat. Therefore, the sales of shiitake mushrooms extend both domestically and internationally. It is said that at the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, American soldiers in Shanghai tasted shiitake mushrooms and instantly felt their flavor cleanse their hearts and minds, washing away the greasiness from their mouths. They considered it an unparalleled delicacy in the world. They rushed to buy them in the market and brought them back to the United States to give as gifts to relatives and friends, causing the price of mushrooms to soar at that time, and mushroom farmers profited several times over. Mushrooms grow wild</p>
<p>on decaying grass and tree bark. To obtain mushrooms, one must use an axe to cut and split the tree bark to promote growth, which is different from the method of cultivating ubiquitous wild mushrooms. The quality of the same shiitake mushroom varies greatly, and the prices also differ. Flower mushrooms are the highest quality of mushrooms, with white patterns on the cap, caused by the mushroom cap cracking due to sudden sunshine after snowfall. The next best is thick mushrooms, which are thick in texture and small in size, caused by prolonged sunny weather during severe cold, making it difficult for the mushroom cap to expand. If there are consecutive days of cloudy and rainy weather, the mushroom cap expands and becomes thin in texture, which is called thin mushrooms, the lowest grade of shiitake mushrooms. The quality of mushrooms depends entirely on the weather, so mushroom farmers regard obtaining flower mushrooms as a blessing from heaven, which cannot be achieved through human effort.</p>
<p>To grow mushrooms, one must first select trees. There are more than two hundred kinds of trees that can be used to grow mushrooms, such as chinquapin, Chinese torreya, chestnut, holly, olive, and juniper. These trees are all produced in deep mountains and remote valleys, with the most in Fujian Province, and also produced in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces. Although mushroom trees are produced in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, the people who grow mushrooms are the specialty of the people of southern Zhejiang. Because the method of making mushroom trees has always been strictly guarded as a secret by mushroom farmers, outsiders have no way of knowing it, making it the exclusive patent of mushroom farmers in southern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Longquan, Jingning, and Qingyuan counties in southern Zhejiang are the main bases of mushroom farmers, with a total of</p>
<p>150,000 people. From October to March of the lunar calendar is the mushroom growing season. Whenever the yellow leaves fall, there is often a group of people in tattered clothes and haggard appearance, men, women, old and young, carrying bags and baskets, walking along the Longqing highway. These are the mushroom farmers who are setting off for the mushroom mountains. They go to the mountains in winter and return in spring every year, as they are accustomed to it, operating in the cold mountains and ridges, and their lives are extremely bitter. In their minds, they only look forward to a pile of flower mushrooms revealed in the snow, which can make them rich.</p>
<p>After the mushroom farmers reach the mountain area, they build thatched huts to live in and begin to work. The selected trees are cut down, with the branches pointing downwards and the roots pointing upwards, removing the twigs and branches, and using an axe to make scars on the trees, each called "making rafters." Then, the branches and leaves are placed on the trees to cover them, called "covering clothes," and then they are left to be exposed to the sun and rain, wind and snow. By the second winter, they see if any small mushrooms have grown. Usually, it takes until the third year.</p>
<p>Those who have mastered the method of making rafters may even bloom in two years. After the flowers bloom, the branches and leaves covering them are removed, called "opening clothes." In the following three years, mushroom production is at its peak, called the golden age. At this time, mushrooms of different thicknesses and sizes are produced depending on the weather. After the tree bark rots, although the method of "催檣" can be used - lightly tying thin boards to the tree trunk to make it move - the yield is ultimately not much.</p>
<p>This large group of mushroom farmers travels across vast areas, managing their mushroom business. After the mushroom farmers harvest the mushrooms, they dry them, grade them, pack them into cloth bags, and transport them to the mushroom shop for sale. The organization of the mushroom shop is extremely simple. Every year in October of the lunar calendar, the boss and the mountain worker determine the location and start the business. They have a large amount of cash on hand to pay the mushroom farmers and provide them with food and lodging. When the mushroom farmers are short of food, they also provide high-interest loans, pre-ordering this year's mushroom production, and the mushroom farmers have no control over the selling price.</p>
<p>The prosperity and decline of the mushroom shop depends on the boss's relationships, the mushroom farmers' creditworthiness for loans, and issues such as weighing and selling, and even disputes between mountain owners and mountain workers, or difficult requests, all have an impact on the shop. Therefore, the bosses of the mushroom shops do their best to cater to the mushroom farmers, striving to make the business thrive.</p>
<p>The mushroom industry is not only related to the lives of mushroom farmers, but also has a significant relationship with the rural economy of the border areas of southern Zhejiang. In recent years, the dumping of foreign mushrooms has caused the shiitake mushroom market to become sluggish, the price of mushrooms has plummeted, and the mushroom industry is facing a crisis. This is because mushroom farmers secretly adhere to old methods and do not know how to improve, resulting in a daily decrease in production and a decline in quality. If scientific methods can be adopted to improve it, it may not be impossible to save it.</p>
<h3>Cash Flows South; Reaches 300 Billion in Over 20 Days; 100 Billion Intercepted in Shantou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhou, 1st] A certain national bank in the city reported that in just over twenty days, cash was privately transferred south from Shanghai, with the total amount estimated at around 300 billion. 100 billion was transported to Shantou and 200 billion to Guangzhou. The authorities received confidential reports about the batch of banknotes being shipped and knew that it was done by a certain financial authority in Shanghai. They immediately made arrests, resulting in the seizure of three batches totaling 50 billion yuan in Shantou and two batches totaling 50 billion yuan in Guangzhou. However, the trend of large amounts of cash flowing south has not been curbed.</p>
<p>The anti-smuggling work in South China is actively underway, and smugglers have changed their "strategy." Most of them have switched to the Macau-Zhongshan route, while others take trains from Hong Kong to the Sino-British border, forcibly carry goods across the border, and then take trains from Shenzhen to Guangzhou. This lawless situation has proven to be a major headache for law enforcement.</p>
<p>Zhuo Yifen, the former magistrate of Nanxiong County in Guangdong Province, was detained by the provincial government for investigation on charges of corruption. The magistrate once attempted suicide by cutting his throat with a razor in prison but failed. Recently, Chairman Song Ziwen ordered that he be escorted to the city for interrogation. However, he bribed Officer Chen of the Qujiang Security Police Squad, who was responsible for escorting him, with 400 million national currency, and both escaped without a trace. They are currently wanted.</p>
<p>Amidst the housing shortage in Guangzhou, even central government agencies cannot avoid this predicament. A large Western-style house at No. 52 Fuxing Road, Shamian, managed by the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office, was originally designated as the location of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but this has been going on for a year. Recently, the Enemy Property Office suddenly notified the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, limiting it to move out within half a month, so that the Credit Bureau of the Central Trust of China could use the place. The head of the office, Guan Shi, negotiated with Zhao Wanping, the head of the Enemy Property Office, several times, but to no avail. They will file a lawsuit in court. People laugh and say, "Officials are forcing officials to move."</p>
<p>According to a report from Nanhai: A resident of Xingrenli, Foshan Town, named Zhong, has a daughter named Yinniang, who is only six years old and has not yet attended school, but she can write with a brush and write large characters outside the size of a ruler. The characters are in the Six Dynasties style, vigorous and well-organized, causing a sensation in the city. Calligraphers in the city have tested her repeatedly, and it has always been successful. Everyone is amazed at her talent as a goddess. Her father said that if he has travel expenses, he plans to travel to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and bring her to visit and ask for advice from President Yu Youren. (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)</p>

<h3>Dredging Geng Mountain; Dredging the Lake Water; Reclaiming Fertile Land</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Yuyao, January 29th] Mount Mou Lake is located in the west of Yuyao County, with an area of more than 11,400 mu. It is said that it was originally farmland in the Ming Dynasty. Later, due to water conservancy, the fields were opened as a lake, and now a part of it has been dredged and cultivated into fields to increase production. It has truly experienced the changes of mulberry fields into the sea. After three months of dredging and cultivation, Mount Mou Lake has acquired more than 3,500 mu of land, and the procedures for receiving cultivation are currently being handled. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to use the land as a demonstration farm for mechanized farming, and the villagers also place infinite expectations on it. The plan to dredge and cultivate Mount Mou Lake was launched before the war. In the 29th year of the Republic, the Mou Mountain and Liu'an Two Lakes Dredging and Reclamation Committee was organized to</p>
<p>divide the area and proceed with reclamation. Soon after, enemy cavalry crossed the river and harassed, and Yuyao was soon occupied, and the reclamation work had to be suspended. Last summer, the Zhejiang Provincial Reclamation Committee re-proposed the dredging and reclamation of Mount Mou Lake. Dr. Mao Gen, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Post-War Agricultural Abandonment Committee of the Relief Administration, also visited the lake twice to investigate, and believed that it was very reasonable and could be carried out. In mid-September, the "Mount Mou Lake Dredging and Reclamation Committee" was established, and expert Wu Guochang was hired as the chairman, and Sun Xinian, the head of Mou Mountain Township, was the vice chairman. The Joint Relief Office provided equipment and used the latest agricultural machinery for dredging and reclamation. It was decided to start work on October 1, and mobilize 1,600 farmers from Mou Mountain, Kaiyuan, Qinggang, and other townships to start from the reconstruction of the embankment project, that is, use the Joint Relief Office's relief flour to provide labor, and borrow 2,000 zu of grain from the Yuyao Water Conservancy Association to pay the expenses. The project began to proceed.</p>
<p>The embankment construction project was scheduled to be completed by the end of October. After the start of construction, due to the cold weather and the hardness of the soil, and the farmers lacked experience in handling the mud, the work could not be carried out. Therefore, the Reclamation Committee contracted another contractor. Since Double Tenth Festival, more than 2,000 workers have been working on the surface of Mount Mou Lake every day, densely packed like ants, buried in their work, and completed the task on schedule at the end of October, obtaining 3,500 mu of lake fields. Taile can then carry out dredging, which was delayed due to</p>
<p>financial twists and turns and must be completed before spring plowing this year.</p>
<p>The Reclamation Committee has been continuing to engage in canal construction, building gates, and other projects, and is handling the registration procedures for inviting strict reclamation. The management method is determined to be based on the principle of self-cultivation and cooperation, and the land is allocated to the nearby townships and farmers who have contributed to the dredging and embankment construction project by drawing lots. The county government issues a land certificate for the reclaimed land, and the land ownership belongs to the reclaimed farmer after all the project costs are paid off in installments, but it is stipulated that it cannot be sublet, sold, or divided. The county government allows the reclaimed land to be</p>
<p>exempted from taxes for five years. In the future, Mou Mountain Lake and various rivers must continue to be dredged, and dams must also be repaired, so it is stipulated that reclaimed farmers must pay a 60% interest fee to the Water Conservancy Association after obtaining property rights, which is equivalent to 50 jin of grain per mu. The payment will be stopped as soon as the work is completed, and it is currently limited to a maximum of ten years.</p>
<p>As the spring plowing season is approaching, the villagers are enthusiastically going to the township to register and apply for reclaimed land. The Reclamation Committee is negotiating with the Agricultural Bank for agricultural loans to purchase plowing cattle, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers. Fourteen tractors from the Joint Relief Office's Restoration Team have already been shipped. This spring, it is planned to first use barley, wheat, peas, broad beans, rapeseed, and purple cloud English as experiments. It is expected that when mechanized cultivation and planting are successful in the future, farmers will enthusiastically praise the greatness of this project. (Ben Zhu)</p>

<h3>Secondary Education Research Association Has No Right to Test and Send Free Students; Spokesperson of the Municipal Education Bureau Exposes the Inside Story</h3>
<p>[Dahua News] The announcement of the so-called "Second Examination and Sending of Free Students by the Shanghai Municipal Secondary Education Research Association" reported in the newspapers these days has attracted much attention from all parties. According to a spokesperson of the Municipal Education Bureau, private secondary schools in this city should set up free student quotas to benefit impoverished children. This has long been stipulated by the Municipal Council and ordered by the Bureau to be followed. Impoverished students of all schools can obtain free treatment by applying directly to the schools. However, the "Secondary Education Research Association" itself has no financial resources in the preparation of free funding, but it even seizes the free student quotas originally stipulated by each school, in order to seize the right to control them, intending to take advantage of tricks, which is close to deception. The Bureau cannot but strictly ban it. In addition to ordering each school not to hand over the free student quotas already set to the "Secondary Education Research Association" for distribution, and informing impoverished students that they can apply directly to the school for free, the Bureau will also investigate the person in charge of the association, and hope that people from all walks of life will expose its inside story, so that pure and good youth will no longer be confused by it.</p>

At the end of the first half, the Shantou team took the lead with 21 to 14. When the two teams re-entered the field, the Shantou team's score increased sharply. At 22 to 36, Hu Chubang of Jiangxi Guang graduated with five fouls. Zhu Siheng filled the gap, but the Shantou team still did what they wanted. When time was up, the visiting team was defeated 28 to 55.</p>

<h3>National Banks and Bureaus Gathered at the Four Joint Offices Yesterday to Review Applications for Purchase Cases; Purchase of Finished Products Mostly in Cotton Weaving and Soap; Meetings to Be Held Daily Until the End of the Lunar Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] National Banks and Bureaus, acting as agents for the government to purchase finished products, convened the first Review Committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Four Joint Offices branch. Liu Gongyun, Wang Zishuang, Zhu Tongjiu, Diao Minren, and many others attended. Chairman Liu Gongyun reviewed 56 applications for purchase, with a total application amount of over 10 billion yuan, all of which were approved. Yesterday's applications were mostly from the cotton weaving and soap industries. It is heard that the committee will hold a meeting at the Four Joint Offices branch every day until the end of the lunar year, so as to review the application cases submitted by the National Banks and Bureaus on a daily basis. When applying to purchase finished products, manufacturers must first request the following three forms from the relevant banks and bureaus: ① Factory Production Statistics Table for the past six months, ② List of Finished Products Applied for Purchase, ③ Recent Balance Sheet, and submit them to the relevant banks and bureaus for investigation and review. Those approved can obtain the funds within one or two days. The finished products purchased from each factory will be handed over to the China Trust Bureau for public auction.</p>
<p>The industrial sector in this city has many concerns about the purchase method. They believe that one is that the quantity of finished products purchased is limited, and the assistance to the country may not be great; the second is the fear that after the government purchases these finished products, it will sell them to the market at low prices in order to stabilize prices, which will greatly harm manufacturers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, both the northern and southern markets received a total of over 11,400 *shi* (bushels) of rice. With the Lunar New Year approaching, shops were genuinely consuming more than speculating, resulting in brisk market activity. *Jing* rice continued to rise, increasing sharply by 250,000 *yuan*. *Xian* rice also rose sharply by 560,000 *yuan*, and *baiyuan* (white rice) was also in high demand.</p>
<p>Wheat flour rose steadily, continuing to increase by 120,000 *yuan*. Wheat bran also increased significantly by 67,000 *yuan*. Bean cakes from Shantou declined, with many dealers from other regions selling off their stock, causing a sharp drop of 300,000 *yuan*. Soybean oil factories were less active, and dealers from other regions were also subdued. Du yellow beans were strong, rising by 120,000 *yuan*, while other beans were generally soft, either openly or discreetly. Green beans rose by 670,000 *yuan*, red beans remained unchanged, cowpeas showed little fluctuation, and broad beans saw little trading, with prices being high initially but subsequently reduced.</p>
<p>Red sorghum remained stable. Corn from Yantai was readily accepted, rising sharply by 350,000 *yuan*. Raw peanuts saw little activity from either local or outside traders, and trading was average, with mid-grade ones declining by 340,000 *yuan*.</p>
<p>Sesame from Tianjin remained unchanged. White sesame declined by 350,000 *yuan*, and black sesame fell sharply by 780,000 *yuan*.</p>
<p>The oil market declined due to falling prices inland, leading to a cautious market sentiment and strong selling pressure. Raw oil fell sharply by 1 million *yuan*, with *ji* barrel raw oil falling below the 4 million *yuan* mark. Soybean oil factories successively sold off their stock, leading to a decline of 450,000 *yuan*. Rapeseed oil and clear oil both fell by 350,000 *yuan*.</p>
<h3>Coal Price Adjustments Announced Yesterday by the Fuel Management Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Xiwei, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, flew to Beiping on the 26th of last month to negotiate an increase in the transport of northern coal to the south. Having completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai yesterday. He told reporters that during his trip, he had negotiated with the Kailuan Mining Bureau, the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau, and the Beiping-Tianjin Fuel Management Committee regarding the transportation of coal from the new port to the south. An agreement has been reached to pilot the transport of 30,000 tons of coal south starting from February 1st. During his stay in Beiping, he visited Director Li of the Executive Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief Chuan, discussing the increase in the quantity of northern coal transported south and the protection of the Beining Railway. The Kailuan Coal Mine currently has 800,000 tons of coal in storage and can produce 450,000 tons per month. After meeting domestic demand, there is still a surplus available for transport to the south. In terms of white coal, Datong can produce several thousand tons more per month, and Mentougou can produce 100,000 tons per month. Once the transportation problem is resolved, the supply to the south can be continuous.</p>
<p>[Further Report] The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has adjusted the coal prices for February, effective yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>Grade A coal for public utilities, delivered at the pier, is 3 million *yuan* per ton; delivered on barges, 2.05 million *yuan*. Grade B coal for railway, military, and naval use, delivered at the pier, is 3.25 million *yuan* per ton. Grade C is divided into eight levels, ranging from 320,000 *yuan* to 3.65 million *yuan* per ton, for out-of-town power plants, ships, and transportation agencies under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau. Grade D coal for factories, military, and government agencies, is divided into eight levels, ranging from 4 million *yuan* to 4.4 million *yuan* per ton. Grade E coal for public utilities overseas is 4.6 million *yuan* per *jin* (catty, approx. 500g) for coal dust and 5.04 million *yuan* for coal lumps. Coal dust for factories is 5.17 million *yuan*, and coal lumps are 5.04 million *yuan*. Grade F white coal is divided into six levels, ranging from 3.23 million *yuan* to 7.84 million *yuan*.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw an increase in prices due to a shortage of spot goods and active real sales, leading to significant fluctuations. The Sugar Guild's assessed price for current spot Grade 24 raw white sugar was initially 1.94 million *yuan*, then rose to 1.978 million *yuan*, before slightly easing in the afternoon. The price for bagged Grade 4.5 white sugar was 1.98 million *yuan*, later falling back by 340,000 *yuan*. Grade 20 medium-grain white sugar was 1.865 million *yuan*, Shantou green sugar was high at 1.55 million *yuan*, cotton red sugar was 1.75 million *yuan*, and good quality refined white sugar in baskets was 1.8 million *yuan*. Xing red sugar ranged from 1.62 million to 1.54 million *yuan*. Diao green sugar ranged from 1.523 million to 1.5 million *yuan*, Hainan red sugar was 1.69 million *yuan*, sliced green sugar was 1.3 million *yuan*, Taiwanese green sugar ranged from 1.42 million to 1.4 million *yuan*, and Shunde green sugar was 1.53 million *yuan*. Futures warehouse warrants rose by varying amounts of over 100,000 *yuan*, with spot goods rising by about 10% compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Hai Xiang* ship arrived from Kaohsiung yesterday with 20,000 bags of sugar, currently being unloaded at the Jinliyuan Wharf.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics Weaken</p>
<p>The woolen fabric market has been calm recently. Due to seasonal and environmental factors, both large and small transactions have decreased. Prices for various fabrics have weakened. The year-end financial reports of various firms show that many are superficially profitable but actually losing money. While accounting in national currency shows large profits due to rapidly rising prices, a review of actual inventory reveals that two-thirds of firms have suffered losses because their inventory is lower than the previous year. This is especially true for smaller firms that are not members of the guild, which have suffered even greater losses.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Frequently See Low Prices; Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Are Weak</h3>
<p>The situation for Chinese stocks was even more dire yesterday, with widespread forced sales. Hong Kong Electric also rose further, leading to frequent low prices. Small stocks saw smaller declines, while new domestic stocks continued to rise to their limit. Eventually, market sentiment stabilized, and prices recovered slightly after the weakness.</p>
<p>The morning opening was fearful, with Wing On Textile falling to 702 and 712 *yuan*. It continued to fall to 678 and 687 *yuan*. After a slight rebound, it fell again to 671 and 678 *yuan*. After 10:30 AM, more buying occurred, and Domestic Goods (stocks) hit their limit, causing Wing On Textile to rise to 677 and 687 *yuan*. Soon after, the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram rate rose to 3.7 *yuan*, causing many to close out their positions, leading to oversupply and pushing the price down to a low of 660 and 672 *yuan*. Off-market prices were again higher, and the market then turned. The noon closing price was 664 and 674 *yuan*. Compared to the Saturday immediate delivery prices, only Domestic Goods rose by 50%, while Mayer &amp; Fech, China Textiles, Shanghai Knitwear, Wuhe, Wing On Textile, Sincere, New Kwong, King Foong, Chun Hing, Sino-French, New China, Wing Foong, Matches, Wing Kung, and China Silk Scarf declined by 5%. The rest saw slight declines. For deferred delivery stocks, Mayer &amp; Fech, Sincere, China Textiles, and King Foong each fell by 10%, while Wing On Textile, New Kwong, and Chun Hing fell by 5%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Domestic Goods rose to its limit at 106, with 76 and 148 entering deferred delivery and 226 entering immediate delivery, rising to 680 and 690 *yuan*. However, the atmosphere of fear remained strong. Soon, a wave of selling began, with no support, pushing the price down to a low of 659 and 667 *yuan*. With the Bank of China’s exchange difference, market sentiment gradually calmed, rising to 680 and 690 *yuan*, before closing at 675 and 684 *yuan*. Compared to the morning immediate delivery prices, Domestic Goods hit its limit, while Wing On Textile, China Textiles, Wing Hong, King Foong, New China, and Heng Foong rose by 50%. The rest of the stocks saw mixed results. Off-market unlisted stocks recovered slightly by up to 50%. Public utility stocks saw the largest declines.</p>
<p>Government bonds fell again yesterday. United C bonds opened at 72,000 and formed a one-way downward trend, falling to 64,000 before stabilizing. Trading volume was approximately 4 million. Compared to the previous closing prices, A, B, and E bonds each fell by 5,000 *yuan*, United C bonds fell by 7,000 *yuan*, and United D bonds also fell by 6,000 *yuan*.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also fell sharply yesterday. Foreign and Cantonese merchants were selling. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram rate also rose to 3.7 *yuan*, leading to market instability. Ewo Textiles fell to around 520,000, with limited recovery. Compared to the previous Saturday, Ewo Textiles saw a slight decline. British &amp; Chinese Corporation, Ewo Brewery, Telephone, and Tramways remained stable, while Jardine Matheson, Ye Guang, Paper, Navigation, and Steel each fell by 5%.</p>
<h3>Small Loans from Money Shops to Begin Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The small-sum credit loan syndicate organized by the 76 member money shops of the Shanghai Money Trade Association is officially launching today. All small handicraft businesses and small-scale commercial businesses that have registered with the relevant government agencies may apply for loans from the syndicate's loan application office. The use of loans is limited to: Funds for small handicraft businesses to purchase raw materials and tools, and working capital for small-scale commercial businesses. The interest rate is tentatively set at 6% per month. The loan amount is limited from 2 million *yuan* to 6 million *yuan*. The term should not exceed three months, with monthly installments. The syndicate's elected management committee consists of 15 members, including Shen Rixin and Wang Yangsu. The syndicate has 76 members, each contributing a fund of 50 million *yuan* (52 members) or 100 million *yuan* (24 members), for a total fund of 5 billion *yuan*. The management committee has appointed Hong Shanshan as the director of the loan office.</p>
<h3>National Bank Raises Interest Rates on Interbank Fixed Deposits</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to sources from the National Bank's Business Bureau, the bank's interbank fixed deposits offered last year had a term of 10 days, with a deposit limit of 500 million *yuan* per unit and an interest rate of 5%. After the method was changed, the interest rate for commercial banks and money shops was raised to 8%, while the rate for national banks and bureaus remained at 5%, and the deposit limit per unit was reduced to 100 million *yuan*. Recently, a representative of the Business Bureau stated that the interest rate for national banks and bureaus has been raised to 6%. As of the end of January, the total volume of fixed deposits offered by the National Bank was 187.5 billion *yuan*, with a peak exceeding 200 billion *yuan* and a minimum of around 100 billion *yuan*. There has recently been an increase, indicating that credit conditions have eased again.</p>
<h3>Yarn Management Committee Stipulates Procedures for Cotton Yarn Registration and Movement; Textile Export Association Purchases 60,000 Bales of American Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Construction Company received a telegram from the Yarn Management Committee yesterday, stating: "Starting from February 1st, the Association will collect blank cotton yarn registration certificates and hand them to customers purchasing yarn to fill out, affixing the factory seal of the respective factories as proof, and then proceed directly to the Association to register and pick up goods for delivery." The company has notified its various spinning factories and warehouses, as well as its customers, that all holders of the company's cotton yarn warehouse warrants should immediately bring their warrants to the company's business office to obtain a blank cotton yarn registration certificate, fill it out themselves, and then take the warrant to the respective delivery factory for stamping, proceeding directly to the Yarn Management Committee to register and pick up goods for delivery.</p>
<p>The Textile Export Association, in order to increase the supply of raw cotton, has requested the Yarn Management Committee to promptly entrust the Textile Construction Company to purchase 60,000 bales of long-staple American cotton and to negotiate with relevant banks for the purchase. This is currently underway.</p>
<p>Coarse Yarn Strengthens</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market opened relatively stable yesterday. News that the Shenxin No. 9 Factory had gone on strike due to unresolved year-end bonuses, affecting production, led local dealers to make purchases, causing the market to strengthen. However, many took profits near noon. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix and Water Moon yarn were unchanged, while Precious Light, Golden City, and Heavenly Maiden yarn fell by 100,000 to 500,000 *yuan*. In addition, 20-count Double Horse, 16-count Heavenly Maiden, and 32-count Silver Moon and Eight Horse yarn rose by 230,000 to 560,000 *yuan* compared to Saturday. Throughout the day, fine yarn was stable to weak, while coarse yarn recovered.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 304 pieces, equivalent to 606 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 114 purchase orders, with 20-count Golden Double Chicken yarn selling for 32.5 million *yuan*.</p>
<p>Fine Cloth Firm</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened yesterday with strong demand from rural dealers. Local dealers also purchased in small quantities, and fabric stores also absorbed supply. Five Blessings and Dragon Head fine cloth saw stronger demand from Hankou and Yangtze region dealers, leading 12-pound fine cloth to rise by 3,500 to 35,000 *yuan* compared to the previous Saturday. In addition, Four Gentlemen, Zhigong, drill, raw cloth, and indigenous cloth also showed brisk trading, while other cloth markets remained stable.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Sell Well</h3>
<p>The cigarette market was strong yesterday due to the approaching Lunar New Year, with strong sales. Dealers purchased and drove up prices, causing the market to rise sharply. Near the close, news that Wing Tai Wo and Hua Cheng were distributing goods led floating accounts to sell off, but the result was that 10-piece Great Britain Old Knife and Two Cigarettes were still up 2.32 million *yuan* compared to Saturday. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and 50-piece tin cigarettes also rose by 56,000 to over 10,000 *yuan*.</p>
<p>The daily necessities soap market saw strong sales, even though the Ouzhi Chemical Company was distributing "Beautiful Brand" soap at a discounted price of 1.28 million *yuan* per case. Due to strong demand from dealers and active searching and hoarding, the highest price reached 1.889 million *yuan*, resulting in a surge of 80,000 *yuan* per case compared to the previous Saturday. Arrow and Knife soap rose by 30,000 *yuan*, while Beautiful, Guanghua, Xiangmao, and other soaps also rose by 50,000 to 120,000 *yuan*. Match prices also rose by 120,000 *yuan*, and kerosene remained firm.</p>
<h3>Financial Management Bureau Inspecting Banks and Money Shops in Batches to Prevent Misuse of Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Report] With the Lunar New Year approaching, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is paying close attention to the movement of the large sums of funds that banks and money shops must recall. In order to prevent these funds from flowing into improper channels, the Bureau launched a large-scale inspection yesterday, conducted in batches. The first batch of 20 banks and money shops will be inspected. The inspection period will be extended beyond the Lunar New Year. The targets of the inspection include the general movement of funds, the reasons for missing or returned documents, and the warehouses and collateral attached to the various banks and money shops.</p>
<p>[Further Report] The Bureau requires that the names, addresses, occupations, and trade association memberships of all customers who receive loans, overdrafts, and draw checks from banks and money shops be accurately recorded. However, due to banks and money shops' neglect of verification in the past, discrepancies often occur. The Financial Management Bureau has instructed the various banking, money, and trust associations in the city to direct all banks and money shops to conduct thorough investigations and accurate records by February 9, otherwise they will be prosecuted according to law. The deadline is approaching, and most banks and money shops have completed their investigations. The Financial Management Bureau will also conduct random checks based on the reports submitted by the banks and money shops to ensure that unreliable customers are prevented from using banks and money shops for activities that disrupt the financial market.</p>

<p>Learning Insights</p>
<h3>Appearance and Reality</h3>
<p>---</p>
<p>If you put a reed in the water, it looks bent, but it is actually straight. The bend is how the reed appears in the water, while the straightness is its original form. Philosophically, this distinguishes between appearance and reality. In our daily lives, especially when a person's knowledge is immature, we often take what we see as truth. This is also the case during the period of ignorance in human knowledge, when the issue of truth versus semblance doesn't arise. However, the pursuit of truth is inherent in human nature, and humanity has long been dissatisfied with appearances, seeking reality behind them.</p>
<p>Human knowledge is the result of human efforts on this path. Knowledge varies in degree, sophistication, and direction: all aim to uncover the reality of the subject of study by peeling away its appearance. Modern scientific philosophy, in its current stage, can be considered the pinnacle of this pursuit. Truth and falsehood exist on a scale, in other words, appearance and reality exist to varying degrees, therefore, knowledge has different levels of depth and sophistication. When knowledge can distinguish between truth and falsehood, science delves deeper, and philosophy goes even further. For example, when a reed is placed in water, common sense can discern that it is actually straight. Beyond this, further questions such as what the reed is made of and why it appears bent in the water are no longer pursued. With advances in science, science is no longer satisfied with the common sense understanding of what a reed is. It analyzes the round and slender reed into fibers, then into cells, then into the cell nucleus and cytoplasm... further into molecules, then atoms, and then electrons. As philosophy advances, it questions the ultimate nature of matter as accepted by science. Scientists take the existence of human knowledge for granted, while philosophers question what it is, how it arises, and how it is established. It is evident that philosophy seeks truth more thoroughly than science. What science considers reality, philosophy still regards as appearance, seeking the reality behind it. Furthermore, science seeks the truth of a part of the universe, a part of reality, while philosophy seeks the truth of the entire universe, the entire reality. Therefore, philosophy is not only deeper than science but also broader: philosophy is engaged in seeking the truth of truth and the reality of reality.</p>
<p>An event or thing presents itself to people and becomes an appearance. The appearance is different from the event or thing, why? Things are objective; whether people see them or not, they are always the same. However, people's perception of things is influenced by various internal and external factors, which combine to create a difference between what is seen and the original form of the thing. For example, a painting looks different when viewed from the front, side, above, or below, in sunlight or lamplight. These external factors, such as position, direction, and light, contribute to the difference between the appearance and reality of the painting. As for internal factors, some are common to all humans, while others are personal: common factors include the structure of the senses and the understanding of perception, which can make a two-dimensional design with color combinations appear as a three-dimensional object; personal factors include the person's artistic background, current emotions, and the condition of their eyes, all of which can cause a painting to have a unique appearance for them at a particular time.</p>
<p>Since people cannot escape the various obstacles of internal and external factors when viewing things, what they obtain is only appearance. How can they peel away the appearance to get to the reality? The only option is to use methods of comparison, verification, and correction. For example, if a reed appears bent in the water, one can take it out of the water to see and feel it, and the results can be used to correct the initial perception of its appearance in the water. This is mutual verification of perception through successive, similar, and different types of senses. If one believes that perceptions are difficult to distinguish and cannot determine which is true and which is false, one can also resort to reason: use the principles of refraction in physics to prove why the reed appears bent in the water. This is using reason to verify the senses. The possibility of obtaining truth is greater when using reason to verify the senses than when using the senses to verify each other. The wider the scope of verification and the more precise the method, the greater the possibility of obtaining truth. The progress of human knowledge is the increasing degree to which truth is sought and obtained. Although one cannot say that it has reached the reality of the universe, it is gradually approaching it.</p>
<p>Literary Talk</p>
<h3>The Prerequisite Problems of "Building the Nation Through Industry"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>"Building the nation through industry" is not a new slogan. After the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the so-called "famous ministers of the Restoration," such as Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang, were all powerful figures who advocated new industries. Institutions like the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau, the Fujian Shipbuilding Bureau, and the Gansu Woolen Mill were already quite large in scale at that time. Why is it that after more than eighty years, Chinese industry still cannot occupy a place in the world? Industrial backwardness is indeed the main reason for China's poverty and weakness. As we begin to build the nation, we must urgently examine the root of the disease in order to provide a means for flourishing and growth. Of course, economics cannot be separated from politics, and if politics is not enlightened, there is no way to improve the economy. Conversely, it can also be said that the economy is the foundation of politics. This problem is too broad and needs to be discussed separately. Currently, focusing solely on industry itself, the author deeply feels that there are several prerequisite problems that determine the success or failure of "building the nation through industry," and I would like to briefly explain them.</p>
<p>The Problem of Industrial Research</p>
<p>The greatest characteristic of the twentieth century is the dissemination of knowledge, that is, the systematic application of the results of scientific research to people's livelihoods and daily use. Research institutions, both large and small, contribute their research results to society as much as possible, and the industrial sector uses this as a foundation to make the best use of it. The scientific method is the cause, and industrial technology is the result. The first issue in building the nation through industry is the issue of brainpower. We must not only find ways to utilize the existing achievements and ready-made materials of advanced countries (in fact, we have not yet made a good effort in this step), but we must also catch up and conduct our own research. How to promote communication between universities and factories is a fundamental and important plan. It is true that universities should maintain academic freedom and should not overly emphasize practicality. However, universities and the industrial sector can cooperate closely, understand each other, prevent Chinese industry from completely relying on traditional techniques, absorb new ideas at any time, increase its competitiveness in the world market, and cultivate a national habit of loving research, making it a unique characteristic of the nation. This is, of course, also a responsibility that universities should fulfill. Universities train talents, test materials, and solve problems for factories, and factories provide economic support to universities for the purpose of supplementing equipment. The way of mutual assistance is mutual benefit. Currently, the country's scientific talent is limited, so it is appropriate to concentrate it in universities. Currently, few private industries have the strength to establish complete laboratories themselves. As for the small number of experimental institutes run by the central government, it is not easy to fully take care of the needs of all regions. Therefore, universities in various places are undoubtedly responsible for the problem of industrial research. In the future, vocational schools should not be limited to training technical talents; more attention should be paid to research work. The government should have reasonable standards for the geographical distribution of vocational schools to avoid the drawbacks of duplication and unevenness.</p>
<p>The Problem of Industrial Location</p>
<p>The so-called regional planning in various countries of the modern world aims to comprehensively plan various factors of national industries, such as raw materials, power, labor, transportation, markets, as well as climate, water sources, and species selection issues, to make the most effective use of human and material resources and to achieve the most favorable distribution. In wartime, we often do not consider production costs in order to cope with national crises, but in peacetime, all industries must be able to develop independently. Therefore, from the perspective of economic concepts and national defense, we must consider many aspects to achieve the most appropriate solution. The study of industrial location is not only for the sake of one industry or one region, but often for the sake of the entire industry and the entire country. From a distance, we must pay attention to the world's position; from close range, we should divide a region into many sub-regions and conduct detailed investigations. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "National Reconstruction Outline" and "Industrial Plan" have already pointed out the main lines and key points of foreign industrial construction. This is a general outline, and more detailed research, data collection, and statistical analysis are needed. Based on past experience and referring to world trends, we can make practical contributions to the geographical distribution of China's new industries, so that national policies can be fully realized. This newly emerging specialized research is called industrial geography. In the past, the failures of industry were nothing more than the three elements of timing, geographical advantage, and human harmony. Studying the interrelationship of these three elements is the task of industrial geography. We firmly believe that private interests can only be entrusted after national interests are established, and that regional designs are only meaningful after a national design is in place.</p>
<p>The Problem of Industrial Management</p>
<p>This problem is the scientific study of labor issues. Its purpose is to improve work efficiency or morale, so that every male and female worker can achieve maximum production. Industrial management not only needs to train skilled workers, but also needs to cultivate knowledgeable and responsible citizens. This scientific research includes many aspects, such as industrial psychology, which is one of the most important. The relocation of factory sites to better locations is also a recent trend. Since the Industrial Revolution, factories have been located in large cities, creating a phenomenon of population concentration, which has led to various social problems. Nowadays, due to the convenience of power transmission, industry tends to be decentralized, developing towards the suburbs or opening up new cities, the so-called garden cities, with populations mostly between 10,000 and 50,000 people. These new industrial zones can be created based on ideals. For the interior of the factory, factors such as light, ventilation, temperature, and humidity should be considered to reduce diseases and improve health. For the environment outside the factory, factors such as hospitals, schools, libraries, entertainment venues, and other material and cultural conveniences are all taken into account. Adults and children are valued equally. These facilities are not only based on wartime experience to meet the needs of the air force era, but also strive to seek happiness for workers, which can indeed be followed as a national economic plan. In short, the ideal of industrial management is not only to reduce working hours and increase leisure time, but also to relieve workers of the pressure of life and the fear of unemployment. This is the price that social security should pay.</p>
<p>The Problem of Resource Coordination</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "No matter how beautiful the peony is, it needs green leaves to support it." Unless agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and mining are all actively improved and progress together, the so-called "building the nation through industry" will ultimately be like a mirage, desirable but unattainable. Dr. Sun Yat-sen foresaw this and proposed ten major construction guidelines, namely: 1. Transportation, 2. Commercial ports, 3. Cities, 4. Hydropower, 5. Industry, 6. Mining, 7. Agriculture, 8. Irrigation, 9. Forestry, 10. Immigration. Any one of these items must have the other nine as necessary conditions. He strongly advocated strengthening the ties between the inland and the border areas, believing that the railways connecting the inland and the border areas were the most profitable investment for the country. Industry is a link in the entire economic construction. If we distort the meaning, the phrase "building the nation through industry" is actually incomprehensible. The author has an article on the ten major guidelines of national reconstruction (published in the "Thought and Era Monthly," issues 10 and 11), which will not be repeated here.</p>
<h3>The Activities of American Philosophers During the War</h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>Our country knows very little about the activities of American philosophical circles during this war because of wartime transportation. We mostly did not receive their publications and books, so we are really ignorant of what they actually did. Now that more than two years have passed since the end of the war, we have gradually understood the activities of American philosophical circles during the war, and American philosophers have also made a rather detailed report on their own work. Now, I intend to describe the activities of American philosophers during the war based on this report. This is not only a lesson for our country's philosophers, but it can also let the general reader know that "although philosophy cannot bake bread," philosophy is not a useless thing in any era.</p>
<p>First, let us explain the attitude of American philosophers towards this war. After the Nazis launched the war, but before the Pearl Harbor incident, the Eastern Branch of the American Philosophical Association held a conference and resolved to express sympathy and resist the aggression of the Axis countries. This resolution was based on two assumptions and one fact. The two assumptions are: philosophy aims to seek wisdom that will be true for everyone, and that this wisdom can only be obtained through the free exercise of human functions. One fact is that the governments of the Axis countries now place race or nation above humanity, and force above right and wrong and truth. In other words, the main reason why American philosophers also stood on the common front of resisting the Axis countries was because the dictatorship of the Axis countries hindered the free exercise of human functions, thus preventing philosophy from obtaining true wisdom. As for the ethics of war and the question of non-resistance or pacifism, American philosophers did not discuss it.</p>
<p>Such was the attitude of American philosophers, so after the Pearl Harbor incident, American philosophers actively participated in the war. Many philosophers, both those eligible for military service and those slightly older, worked in various departments of the American war agencies, and many showed very good results. The work of these philosophers was very complicated. Some were sent to prisoner-of-war camps to manage prisoners, some were sent to the Red Cross to do things, some were chaplains in the army, some participated in the training of new soldiers, some were in the country, and some were abroad. The philosophers who remained teaching at universities also reduced their hours of teaching philosophy and went on to teach other sciences and courses related to military affairs. For example, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, meteorology, languages, etc., all had philosophers teaching them. As a result, their working hours increased, their holidays decreased, and most of them had no holidays. They also specially wrote a "Preface to Philosophy" for soldiers serving in the military. It was written by several famous philosophers, such as Professor W.E.Hocking, etc. All of these can be said to be the work directly related to the war by American philosophers.</p>
<p>American philosophers fulfilled their responsibilities for the war and did the work they should do, but they did not neglect their own work. In universities, the philosophy departments of American universities did not stop due to the war. Although the number of students generally decreased, the number of students in the philosophy departments of women's universities and coeducational universities actually increased. At the same time, the number of graduate students in the philosophy departments of various universities increased due to the increase in veterans and foreign students. As a result, the philosophy departments of various universities admitted students to the maximum extent. The vacancies of philosophy professors who left the university to participate in the war were filled by many professors who had escaped from Nazi-controlled areas and came to the United States, so there was no worry about a shortage of professors. As for the curriculum of the philosophy department, it itself changed little, but courses such as social and political philosophy, democratic political philosophy, the philosophy of war and peace, and the philosophy of Latin America were either newly opened or emphasized. Some university philosophy departments even expanded during the war, such as Cornell University and Yale University. It can be said that American philosophy education developed instead during the war.</p>
<p>Secondly, the various philosophical societies organized by American philosophers did not completely stop during the war. The Eastern Branch of the American Philosophical Association held a meeting in December 1941, and the Western Branch also held a meeting in April 1942. After that, it was suspended for several years due to transportation issues. However, the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology, the Southwestern Philosophical Conference, and the Association for Symbolic Logic never stopped their activities. In addition, several societies were added during the war: one was the International Phenomenological Society, established on December 23, 1939, in New York, and the other was the concern for science, philosophy, religion, and the democratic way of life, which began to be launched in December 1940 and held its first annual meeting in September 1941. International philosophical conferences were also held in the United States during the war. One was the Pan-American Philosophical Conference held at Yale University at the end of April 1943, and the other was the International Philosophical Conference held in Haiti in September 1944.</p>
<h3>T.V.A.</h3>
<p>— Li Chunfen</p>
<p>The Metabolism of the Tennessee River Valley</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, the Tennessee River Valley was a desolate and declining agricultural area, like a patient at death's door. After the doctor's dissection and treatment, it has now reversed its haggard appearance and become a prosperous land full of flowers. This savior is the highly acclaimed T.V.A. T.V.A. is the abbreviation for the Tennessee Valley Authority, established in 1933, responsible for the regional design, planning and execution, and business management of the Tennessee River Valley development, to achieve the triple mission of fully developing resources, rationally utilizing them, and appropriately protecting them.</p>
<p>II. Viewing the Past and Present of the Tennessee River Valley</p>
<p>The Tennessee River Valley is located in the southern part of the United States, covering an area of 40,000 square miles, with a warm climate, warm and short winters, and hot and long summers, with a growing season of about 200 days. Rainfall reaches about 50 inches, with rain in all seasons, more in spring and summer. The general terrain is mostly between 500 and 1,000 feet, with mountains in the east, low plateaus in the north, and low plains in the west. The northern part belongs to the corn and wheat area, the southern part belongs to the cotton belt, and the northwest is rich in tobacco. Its natural resources are quite abundant, with hydropower (potential energy of 4 million horsepower) and phosphate being the most important.</p>
<p>Due to unbalanced land use in this area, in the past, single cropping was the main practice. Coupled with the high intensity of rainfall and the short period of soil freezing in winter, soil erosion is very severe. In the 100 years before 1932, about half of the medium and above farmland in this area could not be cultivated due to soil erosion. It is truly shocking! Moreover, in the upper reaches of the Tennessee River, flash floods occur frequently during the rainy season, rushing into the mainstream. In the alternating area of the middle and lower reaches, the gradient is greatly reduced, and floods often occur in the downstream areas. In addition, there are few lakes along the river to regulate water volume, so the flow difference is very large, with a minimum of 8,000 cubic feet per second and a maximum of 500,000 cubic feet per second. The seasonal changes are very extreme.</p>
<p>In short, due to human negligence, the area was economically backward. In 1933, T.V.A. was ordered to be established to clean up the mess and formulate a comprehensive rescue plan. The focus of the rescue was on soil and water conservation, such as dam construction, afforestation, grass planting, and agricultural improvement. Due to direct prevention and treatment, indirect and huge gains were obtained, and the entire Tennessee River Valley was renewed. A few examples are listed below to illustrate the general situation: Flood control: In January 1946, the flood level in Chattanooga was 35.7 feet. Due to the regulation of the water-blocking dams, it was reduced by 10 feet, otherwise the city would have suffered the fifth major flood in history, and the entire area might have lost 10 million yuan due to this flood. Power generation: The mainstream of the Tennessee River is equipped with locks to facilitate transportation; tributaries are equipped with dams for power generation. In 1946, the power generation reached 12 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 11 times compared to 1933. Navigation: The Tennessee River transport volume reached 256,000,000 ton-miles in 1945, an increase of eight times compared to 1933. From Knoxville to Paducah, a total length of 652 miles, it is scheduled to be dredged by 1950, which can maintain a 9-foot channel. Agriculture, forestry, and soil conservation: The main tasks are agricultural experiments and demonstrations, such as afforestation, grass planting, terrace farming, embankment construction, ditching, crop rotation, fertilization, adoption of new varieties, improved farming, promotion of livestock breeding, irrigation and drainage, agricultural product production and marketing, and rural electrification. After more than ten years of efforts, the farmland that had been destroyed by soil erosion has been restored to production. In 1944, the farmland abandoned due to topsoil erosion was less than one-tenth of that in 1934. Fertilizer production: Using the phosphate reserves in the west, a large-scale factory for manufacturing high-grade phosphate fertilizer and ammonium nitrate was established near Wilson Dam. The products are supplied for military use during wartime and for fertilizing fields during peacetime. According to last year's report, during World War II, T.V.A. supplied 60% of the phosphate used by the military, totaling 100,000 tons; during World War I, the total supply in the area was only 1,000 tons. Currently, a total of 39,000 farmers use T.V.A. phosphate fertilizer, widely distributed in 29 states. Industrial development and adjustment of population occupations: More than a decade ago, industries had been established in various places, but on a small scale. Since the dams were completed one after another and cheap electricity was sold, new industries have flourished one after another. Now, in addition to fertilizer production, there are also manufacturing industries for food, textiles, clothing, woodworking, papermaking, leather making, rubber, pottery, machinery, transportation equipment, etc. Its industrial structure has almost reached a stage of multi-faceted balanced development. Due to the development of new industries in this area, the distribution of population occupations has also been adjusted. In 1940, the agricultural population was twice that of industrial workers, but by the second half of 1944, the proportion of those engaged in industry had taken the lead.</p>
<p>III. The Extraterritorial Application of T.V.A.</p>
<p>After 15 years of construction, the Tennessee River Valley has transformed from desolation to prosperity, undergoing a metabolism. Therefore, many interested people want to apply this new strategy to other regions. In the United States, the Missouri River Valley area has already been planned for an M.V.A.; China's Yangtze River and Ganjiang River basins Y.V.A. and G.V.A. are also extraterritorial applications of T.V.A.; in Europe, there have also been calls for the organization of a D.V.A. in the Danube River basin. In principle, this is not infeasible. Success depends on human effort. As long as the countries involved treat each other with sincerity and take the welfare of the people in the entire basin as a prerequisite, the Danube River may not be transformed into a pleasurable river.</p>
<h3>On "Sincerity" (Part II)</h3>
<p>— Bu Dang</p>
<p>The Use of "Sincerity"</p>
<p>The so-called "achieving subtlety" and "clarifying sincerity oneself," the work of "establishing oneself" and "completing oneself" lies in fulfilling one's nature: all that the mind and body know and do is nothing but the ultimate principles, and all that is obtained from the Way of Heaven as virtue is fully realized. Thus, knowledge is sufficient to know the constancy of one's own nature, and benevolence and courage are sufficient to practice it, to the utmost. As for "establishing others" and "completing things," it is only a matter of "fulfilling the nature of others" and "fulfilling the nature of things"; if one wants to fulfill the nature of people and things, one can only extend oneself to others, and extend others to things. Therefore, it is said: "If one can fulfill this nature, then one can fulfill the nature of things." For the nature of others is like one's own nature, so one can extend what one knows about oneself to know others, and what one uses to establish oneself to establish others, so that others also have a way to know the certainty of their nature, and use their benevolence and courage to practice it, to the utmost. This is what is meant by "fulfilling the nature of others." People and things are all born of Heaven and Earth, and they share the principles of Heaven and Earth as their nature. If one can know the nature of others and cause them to reach their limits, then one can also know the nature of things and cause them to obtain their due. Therefore, it is said, "If one can fulfill the nature of others, then one can fulfill the nature of things." Fulfilling the nature of things has the effect of "being able to manage the great order of the world, establish the great foundation of the world, and know the transformations of Heaven and Earth." "Order" is constancy; "great order" is like saying "reaching the Way," that is, the "five constants" of sovereign and subject, father and son, husband and wife, brothers, and friends. "Managing the great order of the world" means managing human affairs to rectify the "five constants." "The great foundation" is what is called "center," "center" is like the "center" of "descending center," which is the nature of the mandate of Heaven; "establishing the great foundation of the world" means using the power of education to make people "rectify their nature and destiny." "Knowing the transformations of Heaven and Earth" means thoroughly understanding the causes of the changes and destruction of all things in the universe. The ability of modern theoretical science lies entirely in this. "Knowing the transformations of Heaven and Earth" can "assist in the transformations of Heaven and Earth." The application of modern applied science often goes up to the sky and enters the earth, breaking through the barriers of mountains and rivers, turning danger into safety, eliminating the obstacles of roads, and turning distance into proximity. Is this not assisting in the transformations of Heaven and Earth?</p>
<p>The ability of "sincerity" and "achieving sincerity" reaches the extreme of "knowing the transformations of Heaven and Earth" and "assisting in the transformations of Heaven and Earth." Its effect is "then form, form then manifests, manifests then illuminates, illuminates then moves, moves then changes, changes then transforms"; its merit is "without ceasing, without ceasing then long-lasting, long-lasting then evident, evident then far-reaching, far-reaching then broad and deep, broad and deep then high and bright." For "sincerity" means that all that is known within the heart is a shared principle and public rule, and all that is done outside the body is nothing but the implementation of a shared principle and public rule; what the body comes into contact with and does is something that has traces that can be sought, so it is called "form." The principles of the intangible are applied to tangible things, and their effects are seen, so it is called "manifest." When the principles are manifest between things, things fully obtain their reasons for being, and what is obscure is all illuminated, so it is called "illuminate." When one understands the reasons for the existence of things, one can rely on their principles to control them, so it is called "move." When there is movement, change arises; when there is change, there is a way to adapt to the times and take what is appropriate to the situation. Its effects are not something that those who are confined to old habits can窥测, so it is called "transform." Only because the mind and body of "sincerity," both inside and out, and its thoughts and actions, are all manifestations of the Way of Heaven and Earth, can it be "without ceasing." "Without ceasing then long-lasting," nothing is otherwise: the movement of the sun, moon, and stars, only because it does not cease, can it last as long as Heaven and Earth. As for the birth of the human body, it is because the mechanism of metabolism does not cease; the water of rivers does not rot because it flows endlessly. When it is long-lasting, merit is achieved and effects are evident, so it is said "long-lasting then evident." When merit is achieved and effects are evident, they are spread to different places and cities, so it is said "evident then far-reaching." "Far" means long, referring to time; "reaching" means great, referring to space. The moral achievements of "sincerity," its actions are as broad as Heaven and Earth, its transmission to the world is as long-lasting as Heaven and Earth, and its admiration by countless generations is like the high and bright, the long-lasting Heaven and Earth, without distinction, so it is said: "Broad and deep matching the Earth, high and bright matching the Heaven, long-lasting without bounds." If one can be like this, then one's merit is equal to Heaven and Earth, and one can "be evident without being seen, change without moving, and achieve without doing." This is the eight ideal qualities set up by Confucianism by analogy with Heaven. (Concluded)</p>

<h3>Searching for the "Shoe-Shining General"</h3>
<p>Editor: My uncle, Mr. Jiang Min, joined the resistance work during the September 18th Incident. My aunt and younger siblings were all shot and killed by the Japanese invaders. After the failure in the Northeast, my uncle returned to Tianjin to promote resistance against Japan, and made a living shining shoes or selling vegetables at the Tianjin Railway Station, still donating all the money he earned to the country. At that time, newspapers all featured this interesting story of patriotic deeds, and people called him the "Shoe-Shining General." In 1936, he served as a political instructor at the Central Military Academy's Special Training Class, and also served in the Military Affairs Commission's Mobile Corps. After the July 7th Incident, he followed the government to Chongqing, and there has been no news since the victory. He is over fifty years old this year and is from Wenshang County, Shandong Province. His patriotic deeds have been seen in elementary school textbooks, but where is he now? Family members are looking for him everywhere. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please send a letter to inform us. We are very grateful! Jiang Huazhong respectfully writes. Mailing address: Secretariat, Shandong Provincial Police Department, Jinan City.</p>

<h3>Regarding Comic Books</h3>
<p>— Mao Gong</p>
<p>I saw in the newspaper a "citizen urgently calling to save the future masters of the nation," which turned out to be about "the need to ban comic books with toxic elements." I am old and no longer a future master of the nation. Even if I read comic books with toxic elements, I should not be on the list to be saved. However, my children, even the oldest is not yet twenty, are undoubtedly future masters of the nation, and they are very fond of comic books. I usually did not pay attention to this, so I did not know if they were toxic or not. Now that I hear someone urgently calling for this, I examined what they were reading. The "drawings are poor," the "text is crude," and the "content is absurd and ridiculous," as the person who urgently called for it said. However, whether there are "toxic elements" worth "saving" is something I cannot immediately agree or disagree with. I must read all the comic books before I can say more.</p>
<p>What I have said above may lead you to mistakenly believe that I intend to defend comic books. Actually, that is not the case. I just feel that the "poor drawings" of general comic books are merely less beautiful than those of famous painters, the "crude text" is merely less elegant than that of famous classical writers, and the "absurd and ridiculous content" is merely about gods, monsters, and martial arts. If children use them as models for school essays or as a treasure trove for managing the world and benefiting the people, they are certainly inappropriate. However, if they are just casually read, it does not necessarily mean they are toxic, and they will be able to see the flaws. Some of the drawings and text in elementary school textbooks are not necessarily free of poor quality and crudeness. As for the absurd and ridiculous content, textbooks certainly should not have it, because their original purpose is to enable readers to cultivate themselves, manage their families, govern the country, and bring peace to the world. However, in leisure reading, gods, monsters, and martial arts are not a problem. If it is said that children will become confused or even go into the mountains to seek enlightenment after reading them, then even if it is not like a person with bad teeth having a toothache after eating beef, the problem cannot be solved by banning comic books, because children are exposed to many drawings and text in their daily lives that are no less harmful than comic books.</p>
<p>Let me give a simple example. Newspapers are full of movie and theater advertisements. The crudeness of the text in some of them is more "toxic" than that in comic books. The crudeness of the text in comic books is due to being ungrammatical or unpolished, while the crudeness of the text in some movie and theater advertisements is sensuous and suggestive. Everyone reads newspapers every day, so there is no need to provide examples here.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Egyptian Anti-Emperor Farouk</h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>The current Egyptian Emperor Farouk is one of the most powerful figures in the Arab countries, but he is also the protagonist of a tragicomedy.</p>
<p>According to a journalist who interviewed him, he is a twenty-five year old young man, with a fat body, soft hair, and blue-gray eyes, perhaps inherited from his great-grandfather Colonel Sevan.</p>
<p>Farouk studied in England in his early years, and the newspapers unanimously praised him as "the most well-educated child in the world." Twelve years ago, his father, Emperor Fuad, passed away. He rushed back to Egypt upon hearing the news and soon inherited the throne.</p>
<p>Initially, when Emperor Fuad ascended the throne, he succeeded his brother, Emperor Hussein. Fuad initially had no money, but during his reign, due to the respect of the people, he collected a huge sum of 50 million US dollars, all of which was left to Farouk. Therefore, the latter has shares in almost every important industrial and commercial enterprise in Egypt. He is the country's leading financier.</p>
<p>Emperor Farouk has ten luxurious Rolls-Royce cars and five Packard cars. He loves to collect stamps, coins, medals, watches, and ancient copies of the Quran. He loves to eat chocolate and likes to swim and shoot wild ducks in his spare time. His regrets are that he often suffers from insomnia and cannot speak pure English.</p>
<p>As early as January 1942, a coup occurred in Egypt. Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha was forced to step down. Farouk intended to appoint Ali Maher Pasha, who was known for his anti-British stance, as the new prime minister. In February of the same year, the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, objected and recommended Mustafa el-Nahhas Pasha as his successor, but Farouk refused and indicated to the British Ambassador that he should return to his country immediately.</p>
<p>Ambassador Lampson had no other choice but to ask the then US Minister to Egypt, Alexander Kirk, to mediate. If Farouk could appoint pro-British and American figures, he would certainly win the favor of the United States. However, Farouk was unmoved. On February 4, the Egyptian Emperor received the British Ambassador for the second time. Sir Miles Lampson was accompanied by Major General Stone, the commander of the British garrison in Egypt, to the palace.</p>
<p>After Ambassador Lampson was received, he took out two official documents. One requested the Egyptian Emperor to abdicate and be taken to South Africa by special plane. The other official document requested the Egyptian Emperor to appoint Nahhas Pasha as the new prime minister.</p>
<p>At that time, the Emperor was hesitant, but British troops had already surrounded the palace, creating a threatening situation. The palace guards were outnumbered. At the same time, two light tanks drove into the palace, making the once prominent Egyptian Emperor no more than a prisoner. Ambassador Lampson asked the Emperor to look out the window and see the good show he had arranged.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Emperor was silent for a while. It is said that he later said, "You have left me with no other choice, because I do not want to abdicate. But I will never forget this incident."</p>
<p>At this point, Sir Miles Lampson and Major General Stone withdrew from the palace. According to rumors from locals in Cairo, the Egyptian Emperor flew into a rage afterward, ranting and raving for a full hour, hitting the table, smashing glassware, and even kicking down the pictures hanging on the walls.</p>
<p>There is also a popular story about the discord between the Egyptian Emperor and Britain. It is said that shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Farouk suffered from insomnia and was chased by a lion in his dreams. He sought treatment from Malaji, the president of Al-Azhar University. Malaji told him, "Your Majesty must kill a lion before you can sleep peacefully." So the Egyptian Emperor went to the zoo and shot two lions. But he still had the same dream and went to Malaji for advice again. Malaji retorted, "You fool. I am talking about a different kind, namely Britain."</p>
<h3>Old Book Stalls</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xinru</p>
<p>Living in Shanghai, buying books is very convenient. Unfortunately, there is always an invisible barrier between me and bookstores. Even if I occasionally enter a bookstore, I can only drool and feel envious of those who buy books. Disheartened, I retreat to the next best thing: spending all my free time running to old book stalls.</p>
<p>The so-called old book stalls are not the usual second-hand bookstores. The books they sell may also be old, but they are arranged neatly, and the prices are not too low; in some cases, they are even frighteningly high, perhaps because the bookstore owners are asking for too much profit. The people who run the old book stalls are probably just people who buy up junk. They do not have storefronts; they simply set up a temporary wooden架 (jià, frame/shelf), or they take advantage of the windowsills of shops, and most often, they are just piles and piles of books heaped on the cement floor, each pile with a cardboard sign indicating a common price. You are free to choose, and if you can find something you like, you will be pleasantly surprised, because the price is not much different from buying waste paper. Compared to the books in bookstores that cost tens of thousands of dollars just to touch, they are so cheap that it's unbelievable.</p>
<p>According to my financial situation, even such inexpensive items can still be considered luxury goods. However, as long as I have a few bills in my hand, I will always run uncontrollably towards Fuzhou Road. There are so many small book stalls on both sides of the road! I often run down the right side of the road and then back up the left side, searching pile by pile in order. I call this "mining." Really, it is not easy to find something you like from that messy pile of broken books. The items are so varied, bizarre, and strange: there are antiques, and there are new gadgets; there are secrets of the martial arts world, and there are complete magic guides; there are Beijing opera scripts, and there are music scores for folksongs, and there are popular songs, and there are triangular love affairs; there are "New Youth" magazines from the May Fourth era, and there are famous works printed on native paper after the Sino-Japanese War… If you want to pick one book, you have to翻 (fān, turn over) several dozens of them, and you might not be able to pick one even after flipping for half a day.</p>
<p>This requires patience. As long as I have nothing to do, I can often linger there for half a day. This kind of gold-panning excavation gives me a strong sense of taste. I feel that the occasional success has an alluring power. When I accidentally discover a rare little book, the joy is indescribable. Moreover, this kind of bookstall has another advantage: they almost always have new items added every day. It is like a circulating library for poor scholars. Presumably, there are many friends with difficult lives who often use this method of "selling old books to buy new ones" to replenish their spiritual food. I feel that I have greatly benefited from them.</p>
<p>Today, while tidying up my boxes, I took the opportunity to inspect the large pile of old books that I had been running around to collect for several months. A ripple of joy could not help but well up in my heart. However, a shadow of melancholy immediately followed. I was thinking: For the time being, these tattered but lovely treasures are lying quietly and comfortably here, but I don't know when, perhaps they will once again drift to the streets like fallen leaves.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Champagne</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Opening a bottle of champagne will inevitably be accompanied by a "pop" sound. This sound is like the most heavenly music to those who love a drink. It is not only pleasant to the ear but also makes people salivate.</p>
<p>The first person to be associated with this exciting music was Dom Pérignon, a humble French Benedictine monk. However, since he discovered champagne, his name has been preserved for more than three hundred years without being forgotten.</p>
<p>At that time, Louis XIV, who was fond of grandiose achievements and extravagant extravagance, was sitting high on the French throne, while a group of devout but happy Benedictine monks were promoting their service to God among the farmlands of Reims in the Champagne province. However, neither their religious duties nor their vows of poverty could prevent them from enjoying a few glasses of the light, unsweetened wine produced in the area.</p>
<p>Pérignon happily accepted the wine that the farmers gave him, classified it, processed it, and then bottled it at the appropriate time. He would hold a candle, tighten his swaying robe, and walk down to the great cellar of the Abbey of Hautvillers. He would taste this wine, try that wine, and an entire afternoon would pass. When he came up the stone steps, he would always have a few bottles of good wine for meals in his arms.</p>
<p>It is said that Pérignon was a learned man, and his knowledge of grapevines, grapes, and wine was unparalleled in the village; and it is possible that this knowledge even surpassed his knowledge of the scriptures. However, one day he made a serious mistake. However, it was this mistake that gave rise to champagne.</p>
<p>In the monastery's white-walled great cellars, there were several wine barrels dedicated to holding new wine that was not yet fully fermented. These barrels were marked with special signs according to the vineyard, grape variety, and harvest period. Other barrels were dedicated to holding mature, aged wine. Usually, the two were kept separate. The wine that Pérignon routinely bottled every afternoon was all drawn from the aged wine. However, one day, in some inexplicable circumstance, these two types of barrels were misplaced, and the aged wine was mixed with the new wine. Pérignon, due to his haste, or because he was absent-minded, did not notice the signs on the barrels—although he faithfully copied the signs and pasted them on the bottles after bottling. These bottles were placed in another corner of the cellar, because Pérignon was a man who knew that the older the wine, the better it would be.</p>
<p>Several months later, one afternoon, Pérignon went down to the cellar again to get wine. He thought that those bottles that had been mistakenly filled should be aged enough, so he took them out.</p>
<p>Pérignon had a habit of always opening a bottle and tasting it before drinking to see if the taste was good enough. He took a bottle at random and casually pulled the cork; however, the sudden pop startled him.</p>
<p>"Ah," he thought to himself, "this is terrible, the wine has gone bad!"</p>
<p>However, to make sure that the wine had really gone bad, he put his nose to the mouth of the bottle, and the aroma was surprisingly exciting and intoxicating. Perplexed, he poured a little into a glass and was shocked to find countless golden bubbles dancing on the surface of the wine. He took a sip.</p>
<p>"Angels have descended!" he exclaimed. "They have left stars in the wine!"</p>
<p>This is the story of the discovery of champagne. If you go to the Champagne province to inquire about the origin of champagne, the people there will tell you the same story.</p>
<h3>Buying American Candy</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>A few days ago, in a million-word memoir of World War II written by an American, I read an anecdote about a case of theft and sale of military supplies in Marseille, France, during World War II. An American black soldier agreed to sell three tons of soap to a French merchant, promising to deliver it at midnight in secret. After he delivered the goods by truck, the merchant climbed onto the truck, opened the boxes, and confirmed that they were the correct type. The black man insisted on being paid in full before unloading the goods.</p>
<p>The next morning, the merchant was overjoyed, thinking that he could make a huge profit, but he was soon disappointed. It turned out that the black man could not get any soap, so he loaded three tons of discarded explosives, and the boxes he loaded were similar to soap boxes. The matter was later discovered by the US military authorities, who could not help the French merchant. The latter could only admit his misfortune.</p>
<p>I think this French merchant must have felt indignant at being deceived. Unexpectedly, I have recently had a similar experience (in fact, I am sure that I am not the only one who feels this way). Haven't you all read in the newspapers in the past few days the advertisement that a certain bureau has entrusted various stores to sell American candy? Of course, there are some stores that pay attention to commercial ethics and remove inferior goods before selling them, but some do not. I went to such a store: it hung a large banner outside with large characters stating "Buy soon!" I could not help but step in and ask the clerk for a bar of ×× brand chocolate. When I opened the wrapper, I saw that it not only had wormholes but was also moldy. The store had a clever way to shift the loss to the customers, because according to the store's instructions, sold goods cannot be exchanged.</p>
<p>I suddenly had a feeling of being cheated. I felt that losing 5,000 yuan was a small matter. Fortunately, I am a person with some common sense. If I had believed the clerk's distorted explanation (at the time, I saw many people buying boxes of moldy chocolate after hearing the clerk's one-sided words), and eaten the chocolate, I think it would have been detrimental to my health.</p>
<p>Therefore, I finally hope that the authorities selling the candy can remove the rotten and spoiled candy when distributing it, and the store clerks should not quibble or deceive customers. The loss of money is a small matter, but the impact on the health of the people is very great.</p>
<h3>Sending off the Kitchen God</h3>
<p>— Guo Yi</p>
<p>It is said that the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month is the day for 送灶 (sòng zào, sending off the Kitchen God). I do not know when this custom began, but Luo Yin of the Five Dynasties wrote a poem about sending off the Kitchen God, so it has been around for a long time. Luo Yin's poem says: "A cup of clear tea, a wisp of smoke, I send you, Kitchen God, to the Jade Emperor in heaven. If the Jade Emperor asks about human affairs, say that articles are worthless." This poem is widely recited by the world. Luo Yin, who was known as Luo Jiangdong (Yin) and was famous in enemy countries, still sighed that "articles are worthless." So what is there to blame for the poor scholars whose words cannot cure hunger? However, reciting his poem is ultimately a cry of shared fate for all the talented and unlucky throughout history! Although Luo Yin was known for his poetry and was unparalleled in his time, it is said that when Li of Jiangnan sent an envoy to Yue, the people of Yue asked if they had seen Luo Jiangdong. The envoy said: I do not know him and have not heard of his name. The people of Yue said: The world has heard of Luo Jiangdong, how clumsy you are! The envoy said: He has no name on the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination. This matter is extremely laughable. Whether or not one is famous is judged by the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination. It is right that the envoy is ignorant and does not know Luo Jiangdong. However, everyone has this view in their minds. Those whose talent is far inferior to Luo Yin's, and who have no support to use as a ladder, will find it even more difficult to survive in this world! "Articles are worthless," Luo Yin expressed his sentiments in his time. Judging from his experience, it was still not to this point. If he were born today, even if he had the talent of Luo Jianyan, it would not be enough to support his wife and children, and he would end up…</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Leaking Secrets (Part 1)</p>
<p>Zhu Qidao said: "I am completely in a passive position in this matter. Uncle knows about my family, so it is difficult for my father's side to get by. Therefore, I have always been afraid to talk about it outside, and I am not hiding it from Uncle." Xiao Bai, seeing that a few words had revealed Zhu Qi's true feelings, smiled and said, "I have known for a long time that Qi Wan is interested in you, but have you ever thought about this matter carefully?" Zhu Qidao said! "I have thought about it. Qi Wan is sincere and wants to be with me. I also feel that it is not easy to find a confidant in life." Xiao Bai said, "She is usually extravagant. Can you afford it with your current status?" Zhu Qi said: "I have also thought about this carefully. According to Qi Wan, she will not go out to perform and will not socialize at home, so she will save a lot of money. Moreover, she has some private money that can subsidize the family." Xiao Bai shook his head and said, "This is unreliable. You must pay attention to this, and don't let it become a burden for the rest of your life." Zhu Qi said: "I don't think it's a problem. As long as our feelings are harmonious, it will be very happy to live a thrifty life. I think the serious problem is still my father's side. How can I communicate with him and get the old man's understanding? My father usually respects Uncle the most. Can Uncle help me talk to my father? I think it will be successful if Uncle speaks up." Xiao Bai said, "I can talk to your father, but what if it doesn't work?" Zhu Qi said, "If my father really doesn't agree, I will have to think of another way. This situation is like riding a tiger, and I have to do it." Xiao Bai said, "What do you plan to do?" Zhu Qi said, "I can only run away!" Xiao Bai was stunned and secretly shocked. Yu Ru only has this one son. If he runs away, wouldn't he make the old man anxious! Although Xiao Bai was thinking like this in his heart, he still smiled and asked, "Are you really planning to do this?" Zhu Qi said, "I can't solve this difficulty without doing this." Xiao Bai said, "Aren't you afraid that your father will be angry?" Zhu Qi said, "I don't think it will be to this extent. I can still come back after I leave." Xiao Bai said, "Aren't you afraid that there will be family turmoil?" Zhu Qi said, "No, Qi Wan can support herself, live independently, and do her own thing, so she can avoid all conflicts." Xiao Bai, after probing Zhu Qi's tone, knew that it was useless to dissuade him, so he still smiled and said, "You young people are really willful, ignoring others and only thinking about yourselves." Zhu Qi said, "This kind of thing doesn't cause much loss to the family, especially my father, who has always lived separately from me. We only see each other every few days, and there is not much affection between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. I think it will be fine if I do this. Although they may not agree at first, it won't matter later! However, I always hope that the old man can understand my difficulties and agree to me marrying Qi Wan. That would be great. And my father trusts Uncle the most. As long as Uncle speaks well, I don't think it will be unsuccessful." Xiao Bai said, "I will definitely talk to him for you." Zhu Qi said, "If this matter is successful, Qi Wan and I will come together to ask you to be our witness."</p>
<h3>Prison Paradise</h3>
<p>— Copper Camel</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," the warden said, "we welcome you to this place and hope you enjoy your stay with us. As you know, this is not an ordinary prison. The guards are kind, the food is excellent, and the rooms are comfortable with no bars on the windows. You are free to wander inside and outside the prison as you please. If you want to escape, no one will stop you. But there is one very severe penalty—you will not be allowed to re-enter this prison."</p>
<p>The above is the welcome speech of the warden of Britain's newest modern prison to new inmates. This prison without iron bars is called Tortworth Court, located in Falfield, Gloucestershire, covering 400 acres.</p>
<p>Since the Labour Party came to power, there has been a preliminary experiment with prisons, trying to replace punishment with kindness to "cure" criminals. Tortworth Court houses 260 inmates. The buildings include a fortress-shaped central building and numerous military huts. In fact, it is a military camp, once stationed by the US military during the war, and the equipment inside is entirely the same as when the US military was stationed.</p>
<p>The warden calls the inmates "boys." The boys work eight hours a day. The rest of the time and on Sundays, they can choose their own entertainment. Indoor games include billiards and table tennis. Outdoors, there is a swimming pool, a football field, and a small fishing lake.</p>
<p>The prison is very democratic. The first thing the inmates need to know is that they do not need to call the guards "Sir." This is one of the factors in building the self-esteem of these young people.</p>
<p>When relatives visit, the inmates greet them in a pleasantly furnished room. A plainclothes guard sits in the distance; he can see the visitors and the criminals, but he is out of earshot.</p>
<p>The food is very good every day. One inmate said, "The meals are like banquets; I have never tasted such cooking. They even peel the potatoes—this has never happened in other prisons. And there are guards clearing the dining room and washing the dishes."</p>
<p>The inmates include murderers, burglars, embezzlers, arsonists, rapists, and other criminals. They are all first-time offenders. Before being allowed into Tortworth Court, each person has been tested by experts and deemed capable of rehabilitation before being admitted.</p>
<p>One day, an accident happened. Seven people escaped—that is, because the prison had no iron bars and no barbed wire fences, they simply ran away and never returned. They were later captured and placed in another prison. All seven requested to be sent back to Tortworth Court, and everyone expressed regret for rashly leaving this happy place. But they could never return; the most unforgivable crime is escape.</p>
<p>Stockholm also has a similar modern prison, built in a beautiful rural area. Every inmate has a private room, like an apartment. London Mirror editor Mr. Bowden visited and saw a vase of flowers in one inmate's room. Famous paintings hung on the walls, bookshelves were full of books, and there was a typewriter on the desk. Whenever he was free, he would sit at the desk and write poetry.</p>
<p>In another room, a sailor was lying in bed reading a book, with an oil painting he had painted himself hanging on the wall. It turned out that there was a guard in the prison who was good at painting, and the sailor learned from him. The sailor's room had a violin, and there were recent newspapers on the desk.</p>
<p>Each room has its own wireless, the windows are open, and there are no iron bars.</p>
<p>This kind of "hotel-style detention" is very successful. This year, more than half of the inmates in Sweden are fortunate enough to be detained in this kind of open prison room.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Bowden's opinion, modern prisons have no emotional effect. The leaders are truly taking on the important task of saving human lives. The inmates living inside only have sorrow, not anger. They feel that they are being treated as human beings!</p>
<h3>No Need to Enter for Timekeeping</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>The hanging clock at home seems to be running slower every day, so whenever friends come to chat, the child will ask him, "Uncle Ji, what time is your watch? Let us compare ours with yours." I don't have many friends, and only three or five people visit often. Fortunately, they each have a watch, so the child won't be "embarrassed." But the result of the comparison is not very satisfactory. For example, three friends came last night, and the child compared the time three times in a row, but the more he compared, the more inaccurate it became, which was the same as not comparing at all. Because when comparing with the first friend, ours was ten minutes slow. Less than half an hour after adjusting it, the second friend came, and when we compared again, ours was still five minutes slow, so we adjusted it forward again. A quarter of an hour later, the third friend came, and when we compared, ours was exactly a quarter of an hour fast. The child said that the third uncle's watch must be running slow, so he refused to adjust it back. I never cared about the accuracy of the watch, so I told him not to make comparing the time a priority, but he refused to obey. Now that I see him comparing it to the point where he doesn't know what's right, I say, "What's the use of comparing? Comparing back and forth is the same as not comparing at all! I will never allow you to compare again."</p>
<p>How could the child be convinced? He said, "How can we not compare? If the watch is inaccurate, how can we keep time?"</p>
<p>I: Keep what time?</p>
<p>Child: We have to keep time for everything. We have to keep time for going to school, and you have to keep time for going to work.</p>
<p>I: It's true that we have to keep time for going to school, but why do we have to adjust the watch? If ours is slower than the one at your school, the actual mistake might be at your school, because maybe it's running fast. But the school always bases its time on the school's time, so you can just look at our watch as being a little faster, for example, if it's eight o'clock, you can see it as eight fifteen or thirty, and so on. As for my work, even though your mom laughs at me when I get up and always says, "Our watch is slow, get up quickly, get up quickly," I have never been late or had my salary deducted, because I always set our watch to be a quarter of an hour slow, for example, if it's clearly seven o'clock, I only see it as six forty-five.</p>
<p>Child: Then wouldn't you be even later for work!</p>
<p>I: Definitely not.</p>
<p>Child: Liar! Mom, Dad is lying!</p>
<p>I: I'm not lying to you. You don't know that the watch at our office is a quarter of an hour slower than the one at home.</p>
<p>Child: Then why did you go upstairs to Zhao's house to compare the time last Sunday when Uncle Zeng got married at two o'clock in the afternoon?</p>
<p>I: Yes, you know that the time of the wedding must be extremely accurate, because it's a so-called auspicious day and time, and you can't miss a minute or a moment. And you always say that the watch at home is slow, I was afraid it would really be slow and I would be late for the ceremony, which would be disrespectful to my friends, so I specifically compared it with Zhao's watch, which you always say is the most accurate.</p>
<p>Child: That shows that we have to</p>
<p>I: Definitely not "shows." When I arrived at the wedding hall of Uncle Zeng, there was no clock on the wall. The wedding hall was deserted. I thought it was already past the time, and I was about to turn around and leave when I suddenly saw someone delivering congratulatory banners, someone delivering flower baskets, and people dressed neatly like wedding guests arriving. I thought maybe it was still early, so I sat down again. Once I sat down, I sat for who knows how long. I couldn't help but ask a friend to compare the time on his watch. It was already four o'clock. Looking at another person's watch, it was still five minutes to four. I simply looked at a few more, and some said five minutes past four, some said eleven minutes past four, some said a quarter of an hour to four, and some even said a quarter to one. But in short, the two o'clock that the host said had already passed a lot, and the wedding had not yet begun. You think that people who are going to be happily married for a hundred years can't even keep time accurately for an auspicious day and time, so why should we care about other trivial matters?</p>
<p>Child: Then Uncle Hu invited you to dinner at exactly seven o'clock this evening, so you don't have to keep time.</p>
<p>I: Of course not.</p>
<p>Child: Then what if they've already eaten?</p>
<p>I: If you go, then you won't miss the meal if you go right after lunch.</p>
<p>Child: Then you can go at twelve o'clock at night.</p>
<p>I: Of course not. But I told him that what he said about exactly seven o'clock was a joke. First, whose watch are we using as the standard? If we use his, then the host is too inconsiderate of the guests. If we use the guests', then at least nine out of ten guests will have different times. Moreover, the amount of effort everyone puts into getting there is uncertain, and even those who clearly arrive early may have temporary problems with their vehicles, so would it be a failure to keep time if they were delayed? Therefore, I say that the invitation card should write "around seven o'clock," and there's no need for a "precise" seven o'clock. And in reality, when inviting people to dinner, it's said to start between seven and eight o'clock at the earliest, because there are always some guests who are busy attending the banquet, of course, some are genuine and some are fake, and they all have to arrive. Let me tell you a story: Father Zhang once invited a guest, setting the time at six thirty in the afternoon, but the guest didn't arrive until eight o'clock. He was angry, so he invited him again and set it for eight o'clock, but the guest didn't arrive until almost nine o'clock. So he simply invited him again and set it for nine o'clock, and the guest didn't arrive until around nine thirty. The last time, he set it for eleven thirty at night. This guest called and asked why it was so late. Father Zhang said that every time I invite you, you are always late, so I simply started at midnight and drank until dawn. That guest was never late after that, but how many people are like Father Zhang?</p>
<p>Child: Then what about catching a train?</p>
<p>I: Nine out of ten people who catch trains don't have watches and haven't missed the train, because everyone always arrives at the station one or two hours early. Those who have watches also always go early, even if their watch is an hour faster than the rest of the world. Because if the train station's watch suddenly moves forward an hour and the train leaves, can you argue based on that watch?</p>
<p>Child: What if you're summoned by your boss?</p>
<p>I: That's the same as catching a train. In short, it doesn't matter to keep time. Therefore, it doesn't matter whose watch is fast and whose watch is slow.</p>
