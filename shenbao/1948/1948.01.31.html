<p>〔又電〕我行政院長張羣，對中國十項經濟改革計劃之聲明，廿九日經華府各報揭載，但無評論。華盛頓郵報標題爲「中國提出自助計劃」。時代前錄報則爲「中國保設財政改革」，各報所載均非全文。又記者有以張院長之計劃，詢問馬歇爾之意見者，渠拒加评論，但稱此十項計劃將予考慮，而未作詳細說明。</p>

<p>〔路透社新德里三十日電〕印度精神領袖甘地，於印度標準時間三十日下午五時，在赴祈禱會途中，被一兇手開槍三四發，彈中胸部，倒地殞命。兇手爲一靑年，在距離甘地極近處開槍。在祈禱會中靜待甘地致辭者約五百人，甘地自所居之畢爾拉堂步行至祈禱會中之演講木台，中其兩孫女扶掖而行。羣衆見甘地到來，退兩勞讓開一路綫，時人　中突有一年在二十至三十歲間之靑年男子，穿卡其制服，自腰際山槍，向甘地連開四響。以事出突然，羣衆一時猶不知已出何事，第見甘地所披白衫自頸至腹，悉為鮮血所染，婦女有驚而昏倒者，有奔往扶掖甘地者，若干較勇敢之婦女，則抱住甘地不放，直待警察之至。</p>
<p>當消息傳出後，整個德里咸感震驚，尼赫魯及其他閣員，以及印督蒙巴頓，均立即自電話中獲得噩耗。德里商店於初聞死訊時，即紛紛打炸，城內軍警大批出動戒備，各階層人民，　集街頭，有放聲痛哭者。畢爾拉堂前，人頭擁擠，有高呼「打倒回敎徒殺人犯者，然官方對於兇手身份，迄尚未曾宣布。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社新德里卅日電〕甘地死後，其遺軀較絕食後尤見瘦削。行刺甘地之凶手，僉信乃印度族極端份子，可能屬於反對甘地促進印回和平運動一派。甘地旣死，印度全境恐將戰火蔓延，印回兩族勢將仇殺不已。</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里卅日電〕據目擊者稱：行刺甘地之兇手係在祈禱會中與人混離，身裁矮小，衣草黃色制服，未引人注意，制服或係自出售美軍剩餘物資商店購得。突然拔出手槍，速開三響，擊中甘地要害。（關於甘地遇刺後之一切消息，刊第三版）</p>

<p>中國政府聞此噩耗，深感震悼悲慟，此一代精神之領導者，當世界需彼努力正殷之時，彼竟撒手棄我人而去矣。印度當其自由奮鬥將告完成之日，此一領袖之損失，實予其人民莫大之打擊。蓋甘地爲印度自由之手創者，設印度而無其英明之領導與無我之犧牲，恐其政治之成就，將遠遜於今日·甘地本人實爲其民族最高理想之象徵，甘地死於其領導民衆作團結統一最後奮鬥之時，其爲國家民族犧牲之精神，實足爲人類最偉大之表率。我國民衆聞此噩耗，莫不哀悼，蓋甘地實一偉大之亞洲人，其理想足爲永　萬世之實訓也。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕立法院於一月間休會一個月，現定二月五日復會。本年度立院首次大會舉行時，即將再度討論公敎人員待遇調整問題。政院此次決定之調整辦法，與立院最初建議相差甚遠，一部份立委認爲不能械默，頃曾一度集會，常推定原提案人劉志平，上書行政院院長張羣，痛陳此次辦法之失當。立院五日開會時，亦將根據各委負意見，詳加硏討，茲將劉氏致張院長書節要如次：</p>
<p>關於薪俸，文武職人員基薪卅元，數自巳相當低，而物價如野馬之奔馳，生活指數却三四個月死釘在一個數字上不動，他們想要不爲衣食住行發愁是否可能，本人認爲：政府支給公敎人員的薪俸，至低也要使他們能够「養廉」，否則那些學養太差的人員，得到機會勢必貪汚。</p>
<p>日用品配購，不可取消，本人認爲政府欲求各地公敎人員待遇平均，不妨將配購辦法逐漸擴充及於京滬以外其他省市。</p>
<p>工人工資，此次政院調整數，竟將技工原有工資核爲最高數四十元，最低廿元，工役最高十八元，最低六元，這是極不合理的，因爲技工較高的工資，係因歷年服務勤勞，每次考續增加起來的，現在政府抹殺他們以往工作的成績，一律核減，有欠公平，應速設法補救。</p>
<p>機關裁員請詳加考慮，應先消滅用人惟私的風氣，先裁有兼職的人，凡有資格做公務員的人，應舉行總登記，政府如實行裁員，必須事前有周密的計劃，決不可一邊裁一邊添。</p>
<p>本人深知文武職人負待遇之增加，可能即是老百姓負祖的增加，不過致府不增加老百姓的負担，也還有開源節流的辦法，所謂開源，不是增稅，最重要的是徵用大小貪官汚吏的國內外財產與存款。所謂節流，最重要的仍是嚴懲貪汚，不要把大部民脂民膏都流入貪官汚吏的私囊中。</p>
<p>院長應爲廉潔的文武職人員着想，提高他們的工作效率，不應讓他們吃不飽餓不死的活下去，希望院長能爽爽快快拿出辦法來轉變這種局面，不再使全國的文武職人員發怨言。</p>

<h3 id="c22">美貸援華與開放內河航權 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>美貸援華計劃，日來正在華盛頓商討之中，馬歇爾國務卿與中國技術代表團貝祖詒君，業已有數度晤談，行政院張院長且有十項自助的改革計劃發表，可見美貸漸能成爲事實。中國朝野當然感謝美國友人的好意。可是日前英文大美晚報以「如何可使美貸生效」爲題，發表社論，提出了以中國開放內河航權爲美貸交換條件的主張，我們却小能無言。</p>
<p>大美晚報社論主張中國應先實行種種內政改革，美國才可給予貸款，否則過去的貸款已是浪費，將來的貸款還是浪費，而且中國的自助能力將更被阻遏。這些忠告，我們政府自當接受。但該報主張開放內河航權，其原文爲「中國對於內河航運必須遵守國際慣例，目前因爲少數中國航商的利益，對於外商船隻，加以反常的限制，不但削弱了中國的交通便利，而且增加了運輸的費用」等語，使我們讀了，大有不如今日何世之威。難消中美中英的平等新約是變成了廢紙嗎？</p>
<p>大美晚報是美國人主辦的報，雖說該報的主張未見得就可代表美國朝野一致的意見，但它却已明白指出追是美國在華商界人士的公意，而且是發經考慮的結論，果爾，則我們以爲十九世紀上海洋塲上的洋大班頭腦，在今天實有若干改換的必要，</p>
<p>中國的確需要貨款，需要外援，以進行戡亂建國的工作，誰同情我們，誰援助我們，我們一定深深地感謝，並願努力自助，以求不愧對助我的友邦·但我們貸款，決不願意接受干涉內政和喪權辱國的先決條件。美國國務院不是一再聲明美國援歐援華的貸款決不干涉他國的內政嗎？決不侵犯他國的主權嗎？在華美商旣然熟知中國情形，難道遠不明瞭美國的對華政策嗎？他們這些年來，誤把國營事業與官僚、本混爲一談，從而屢屢主張阻止國營事業的擴展：他們又主張限制同業公會的權力，修改工廠法的條款：他們反對經濟社會兩部的行政，這些還不楚干涉我們的內政嗎？他們公然主張開放內河航權，還不是侵犯我國的主權嗎？至於他們對於開放內河航權，所持的理由，實在並不「熟知中國情形」，而且有顚倒是非，淆惑聽聞的地方。</p>
<p>開放內河航權，我們認爲侵犯主權，他們却偏要說是國際慣例。如果是國際慣例的話，當年淸廷簽訂不平等條約的時候，就不必把開放內河航權鄭重地列人條款之內，而後來我們取消不平等條約的時候，也不必把取消內河航權寫入條款之中了。卽使退一萬步而言，開放內河航權果是國際的慣例，但在工業幼稚的國家，也有施行保護政策的必要，慣例採用與否，權操在我。同是人類，原無所不平等，但若强使一個小孩與一個成人鬥力，那就極不平等了。過去英國與日本，挾其優强的財力，在中國擴展航運的業務，以中國航商的脆弱，當然不能當他們迎頭的一聲，何况當時有所謂揚子會議Yangtye　Conference者，用大力壓得規模較小的航商不能抬起，來。彼時長江航運，幾被英日洋行所操縱，因此在不平等條約存在期間，中國航業始終不能發展。及至勝利以後，航權收復，僅僅兩年餘的短期中，中國航輪噸位由殘餘的十萬噸一躍而至九十餘萬噸，而且還在機續增加中。這在友邦的美國，應該認爲中國自助的最好實例，如果傎要協助中國建設，就應給予中國航業以發展的機會　把貸款一部份，指定作爲購船造船之用，以增强中國運輸的力量，不應該專替英國人爲虎作倀，把開放內河航權作爲貸款的先決條件。</p>
<p>中國航輪噸位旣已有了九十餘萬噸，不要說內河沿海的運輸已有充分力量，就是外洋運　也可担任一部份。最近中國航業界承運日本賠償物資和由海南島輸日鑛砂，便是明證；這是中國航業界爲國家獲取外匯以濟急需的貢獻，也應爲友邦的美國所同情的。過去中國對外貿易所以常在逆勢者，就是消耗於出口貨的運費和保險費　額外匯的緣故；如果中國能够運輸自己的貨物到外國去，售給國外的貨物，不是F·O·B·上海而是C·I·F·紐約或倫敦，那國際貿易就不致過於入超了。一般外商把現在出口貨的萎縮祇歸罪於運輸工具的缺乏，這也是故意藉口，不是事實的眞相。出口貨的萎縮原也無庸諱言，但最大的原因還是在於外匯掛牌與輸出管理的技術問題上，這是盡人皆知的癥結。其次，則爲內陸運輸的不暢，內地各處經了共匪的擾亂，交通破壞無遺，種種外銷土產也就無法集中於口岸。目前的船隻雖被政府徵用應差甚多，但維持長江和沿海的商運還是綽有裕餘。現在不是有貨沒有船，而是有船沒有貨。我們曉得英商的行駛內河船隻，已有多艘讓渡華商，一部份亦已假借名義掛了中國的旗號，美國本來沒有船隻行駛內河的，現在也沒有增加交通工具的可能。大美晚報說的「削弱了中國的交通便利，」不知何所見而云然？</p>
<p>運輸費用的增高原也事實，但試問其他公用事業有沒有增高呢？卽就英美法人所辦的公用事業如電力·電話·自來水·煤氣·雷車·公共汽車而言，也無不逐月增高，而其增高的程度，恐怕要此輪船運費的增高來得更甚。他們每一次增高的時候，總把油價·煤價·材料費用，職工生活指數，外匯匯率等等的　高作爲理由，難道輪船的行駛就不必受此種種影響嗎？就我們的統計，運費的增高，還沒有跟着物價成正比例。試把三十五年年底的運費與三十六年年底的運費比一比，究竟增高了若干倍？再把三十五年年底的物價指　與三十六年年底的　價指數來比一比，究竟漲起若干倍？就可知我們的論斷不是憑空臆造的了。若說外商的輪船行駛內河以後運費就可低落，這話也難置信，因爲外商輪船也同樣要受着油價·煤價·材料費用，職工生活指數，外匯匯率的彩響的。卽就現在滬港間貨運費用來作比較，英商輪船的貨脚不但並不低於華商，而且高過華商多多。據我們調查，華商對於由滬運港的貨脚祇有每噸　幣一百二十萬元，而英商則需港幣一百一十二元，而且需要香港滙票，否則卽以黑市計算，若以黑市折算起來，要比華商高出三倍左右。所以大美晚報所說的「增加了運輸的費用」，毫不可信。倘然外商爲着打繫華商，相沿用着從前的「揚子會　」的故智，以達到獨霸中國航業的目的，這是「托勒斯」的手腕，豈是我們三民主義的中國所能容許？大美晚報反對專利，何獨厚愛於英國航商的捲土重來而見不及此呢？若是爲了美國自己打算，那過去的旗昌洋行便是先例，也不必再與英國航商較量長短了。</p>
<p>總之，中國固然需要貸款，但更需要國際的同情，中國固然需要外援，但更需要保持自己的主權。否則，外交上一入歧途，主權一旦重行斷送，引起入民的憤慨了。願我政府千萬注意！</p>

<p>（上接一版）關於處理非法行莊之經過，林氏謂：此類非法行莊，均成立於勝利之後，由於執行管理者之放任，及政府法令一時未能貫澈所致。此類行莊，資力頗爲雄厚，專事投機賣買，鼓動物價，民生頗受其害。按漢市全部頭寸不過四千億，而其中半數以上，即在非法行莊手中；並公然在錢業公會內設有交換所，每日交換額在兩千億以上；而合法有照之錢莊，另在正泰錢壯內交換，交換額僅有一千億。合法商業銀行在國行內之交換所，每日亦僅有六百億之交換額。本局成立後，首先即將兩交換所合倂至國行之交換所內，以統一事權，藉便管理。執行之初，頗引起反感，現則已漸趨平息。此舉之良好影響，顯而易見，物價因此而漸穩定，例如白米原售一百零五萬一市担，規已跌至九十二萬矣。目前各停業行莊辦理申請淸理手續者，已在半數以上，申請之載止期已定爲二月九日。武漢行轅主任程潛將軍對此類善後工作之辦理情形，亦頗爲關切。又金管局之工作，除取締非法行莊之活動外，對合法行莊之非法業務，亦在廠厲取締之列。</p>

<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>第一筆在我心上寫上喜訊</p>
<p>一個從事政治的人，他的生命是由一連串的矛盾所構成的。我深嘗個中滋味，但是沒有比爭取貿易協定的鬥爭，來得更冗長，而同時又是更成功，更重要的。當我第一次在國會發表演說，籲請减低關稅和减少貿易限制的時候，時年三十六歲；其後，在一九三四年我們最後獲得勝利的時候，我已經六十二歲了。按在一九一三年通過恩德荷特法案（Underwood　Act)時减低關稅曾獲得暫時的勝利，終因世界大戰爆發而大受影響，一俟共和黨在一九二一年執黨政權之後，他們立即把它撕成粉碎了。</p>
<p>當我從蒙吉維多回來的時候，我發現了兩件事情；一方面，總統計質易協定計劃，表示贊成；但在極端相反的另一方面，他又在我離職期間任命庇克（George　Peek）主持一個委員會，以謀調整國外的貿易關係。庇克曾經擔任過農業調節局局長，不信任减低關稅的拈施，贊成在全國周附樹立禁止通商圈，藉以實施全國復興局和農業調節局的政策。他的理論假如一旦實施，意即貿易協定政策的壽終正寢。此項任命，適發生于商業政策執行委員會成立一星期之後。</p>
<p>我立即會同商業政策執行委員會開始工作，起草貿易協定法案。我發覺委員會中意見一致，主張國會應該指幕普天授權總統，成立互惠貿易協定。大家認爲唯右這種政府可以付諸實施的協定，可獲成功。假如條約中含有大量最减低關稅的規定，而須提交參院核准，則萬無成功希望。</p>
<p>我相信在我國外交政策經濟的一方面之上，乃是政治的一方面，但是兩者又密切相關。在我看來，我們一日不放棄在經濟領域之內挑撥別國的敵意，欲謀與其他國家在政治領域之內發展友好關係，實際上似無可能。當我們正在經濟上和它們作戰時，何能和它們協力促進和平？在區進國務院的時候，我發覺在國務院的檔案中有三十四件正式而強硬的外交抗議，這些抗議是在史莫德—哈萊高關稅法案（SmootHawley　Act)通過後，由不下三十四個國家提出的·它們的抗議也不以文字爲限。它們認爲禁止它們的輸出品进入美國幾等於禁止通商。盛怒之下，它们以衬際行动相报稪</p>
<p>当我从蒙吉雜多回來的時候，我即單刀直入，準備把貿易協定方案向國會提出，並予以通過。一九三四年二月末，我們已經完成貿易協定法案。頗有諷刺意味的一點，就是我們的對手庇克，竞對我們頗有實際的助益，草案原文太長，太複雜，庇克建議。「將法案縮成二三頁，機會可以較佳·」我們遵照他的意見，他是對的</p>
<p>三月二十日，該　案以二百七十四票對一百十一票獲得衆院通過；六月四日，又以五十七票對三十三票獲得參院通過。在參衆兩院中，輿論方面對史莫德—哈萊法案的嚴厲反對對於我們頗有助益。</p>
<p>六月十二日夜九時十五時十五分，我親自看到總統在白宮中簽字於法案之上。總統的每一筆觸，彷彿在我的心上寫上一個喜訊。多年來我爲確立互惠貿易政策以及减低關稅戰疊而作的長期鬥爭，終獲最後勝利。</p>
<p>貿易協定法案是什麼？根據我在國會和國務院的經騐，覺得大衆對於我國政府在外交方面的許多廣泛政治行動，較易把握，也更右興趣，不若經濟行動的難以提摸。要明瞭一個外交上的抗議，一個政治性質的條約，一個大使的被召回或者一個新政府的被承認，並不太困難。然而要明瞭國外商業，關稅，通貨匯兌和債務的交互關係，的確是困難的。</p>
<p>貿易協定法案本身是簡單的，根本上包括三個要點：貿易協定可以談判，不必先行提交國會；關稅可以减低達一半之多，唯以我國須自別國獲得同等的讓步爲條件。凡是對我們不加歧視的國家，减低關稅辦法一律適用。</p>
<p>開頭兩點毋需說明。第三點是引起不少爭論的題目。這就是所謂無條件最惠國條款。這個字句並不是最切當的。它給人的印象，彷彿是獲得或者給與優惠的或者特殊的待遇。實際上，它的意義不過是：「我不會對待你，比我對待得最好的人壞些，祇要你不對待我，比你對待得最好的人壞些」。</p>
<p>至於减低關稅，含義很簡單，就是當我們對從A國輸入的若干種物品减低稅率時，我們對從B-Z國輸入的同樣貨物稅率也同樣予以减低，祇要B-Z國對從我國輸往的外品，也給予我們和它們給予其他任何國的同樣低的稅率以及同樣多的自由（所謂B-Z國，係指除A國以外的其他國家—譯者）。假如B國對我國的產物，比對從任何其他國家所輸入的產物課以更高的稅率或予以更多的限制，那麼B國對我們的輸出品也須付出根據史莫萊—哈萊法案而定的高稅率—這在美國歷史上是登學造極的。</p>
<p>在實踐上，我們一向以右條件形式施行最惠國原則，直到一九二三年·這就是說，常我們和A國簽訂一項關稅條約時，我們减低關稅的辦法並不適用於B-Z國，除非B-Z國同意給我們與A國給我們的同樣讓步。哈定總統時代的許格國務卿，開始以無條件形式施行此項原則。</p>
<p>最惠國原則的右條件形式，證明是一種失敗。爲什麼？任何兩國之問的貿易與其中一國和其他一國的貿易，無論在產品上或者數量上，事實上是永遠不會相同的。假如我們對A國减低某幾種關稅以交換A國對我們减低某幾種關稅，要說明A國對我國某一項稅率的减低，究竟以什麼作爲交換，是很困難的·所以，我們就無法到B國去，並且說：「我們願意把給予A國的幾種低稅率給予你，似如你能協把與A國給我們的幾種相同的低稅率給予我們·」B國可能對於我們和A國所訂協定中規定的貨物，並不發生興趣。這種制度固時也造成和許多國家進行永無休止的談判。</p>
<p>所以貿易協定法案將別聲明必須實施無條件政策。但是有此人反駁說，這樣，等於我們給予人家一些權利，並無相對的收穫。他們會說，「你對從A國輸入的馬匹，著　種子和威士忌酒，减低了稅率，而你則從A國得到了對我國輸出的汽車，小麥和豬油，减低了稅率。這固然很好！然後你就到B-Z國去，把我們給予A國的低稅率，也給予它們——而你却得不到任何東西作爲交換條件！這是不行的！」</p>
<p>但是事實是我們可以打到許多交換條件。B-Z國可以得到我們給予A國相同的低稅率，假如它們對我們不加歧視的話。B國一向或者祗以最低我率適用於Y和Z國，但是假如B國要享受我們的低稅率，它就必須以它給予Y和Z國的相同稅率，給予我們。所以，使用無條件最惠國這個名稱，頗有引起誤解的可能。其他國家獲得我們的低稅率，並不是沒有條件的，而是以它們給予我們平等待遇爲條件。</p>
<p>實際上，此一原則使美國出口商獲得了數千百萬的金元。</p>
<p>在貿易協定成立後的最初兩年中，由於我們從別國獲得的平等待遇以及不受歧視的保障，我國的輸出量，估計價値達二億六千五百萬美元之多。</p>
<p>其他的人會反駁說，將减低關稅的辨法，除適用於與我國業已簽訂貿易協定的一國外，再擴充到其他國家，如是做去，勢必使輸入品大量湧到。他們說，「减低自A國輸入的鞋子的稅率，可能是得常的，但是，假如NB-A國也按照同樣稅率把鞋子運到我國來，鞋子勢將充斥我國市塲。」</p>
<p>答案是B-Z國並不都製造鞋子，以供輸出。或許僅有一二國輸出鞋子，並且可能較A國爲少。</p>
<p>A國在某種商品上是我國的主要競爭者，而我們竟能允許A國减低關稅，不致捐害我們自己的生產商，如此看來，我國的生產商極不致於因B國或C國的輸入品的競爭，而受到損害。因爲從供應上說，它們究竟是次要的。</p>
<p>實際上，凡是向我國作輸出貿易的國家，總是某種或者某幾種商品的主要輸出者。由於氣候，傳統的技術或者原料出產地的關係，它們量宜於爲我們生產這些物品，較其他國家爲美，爲廉。</p>
<p>所以，在談判貿易協定的時候，我們特別注意减低這一類產品的關稅，而對於其他產品，則予以忽視，因爲這些產品，它們對我國並不是主要輸出者·如此，我們可以替我們自己的輸出品，從A國獲得最大的關稅　步，同時我國從A國的輸入，則集中於它擁有最多存貨的物品。至於我國對A國加以忽視的產物，則可耗由與其他國家談判而獲得，一切總以主要輸出國爲”標。這樣辦法，就是所謂找羣一主要供應者「的辦法。</p>
<p>自從一九一六年起，我一直認爲經濟戰爭足使政治戰爭滋長，而貿易上的不相歧視則足以减少戰爭的可能性。貿易協定法案係於一九三四年通過，然而翌年　争在非洲發生，三年後在亞洲發生，五年後在歐洲發生。所以，有人可能會說，「你看，貿易協定並不能防止戰爭。」</p>
<p>當然，我從沒有揚言貿易協定是防止戰爭的萬應業。再者，在貿易協定通過之時，希特勒已掌握政權一年有半，正在瘋狂地實行武裝；墨索里尼掌握政權幾已達十二年，正在計劃阿比西尼亞戰爭；日本進入滿洲幾日三年，正在凖備退出海軍限制條約。貿易協定中所提倡的自由商業，對於這些國家並無用處，因爲它們已在把它們的商業去適應戰爭的需要</p>
<p>假如在一九二二年能够通過像貿易協定之類的東西，而不是通過福特奈—麥克　勃法案（Eordndy　McCumber　Act），猶如在第一次世界大戰期我所發表的幾次演說中所敦促的，情勢可能改觀。</p>
<p>常我在田納西州農家做孩子的時候，我們有兩個鄰人—我且稱他們爲琴金斯和瓊斯—他們互相敵視。許多年來，他們之問一向懷有惡感—我不知道爲什麼。當他們在路上成者鎭上或者敎堂裏相遇見時，他們總是冷冷地互相睜一眼，從不交談。</p>
<p>其後，在一個春天，當琴金斯最需要　子耕作的時候，他的驢子之一竟蹺起脚來了。同時，瓊斯却缺少玉蜀委去餵他的猪。巧事來了，瓊斯已經耕作完畢，有一頭　子閑着，而琴金斯却有一倉王蜀黍。一個友好的第三方面使他們兩個人碰頭，於是瓊斯讓琴金斯使用他的　子，用以交換餵猾的玉蜀黍。</p>
<p>結果，這兩個懷右宿怨的敵人，不久變成最要好的朋友了。一種普通的交易和通常的鄰居關係，使他們明瞭了彼此的經濟需要，終於言歸於好。</p>
<p>是的，貿易協定雖告簽訂，戰爭還是來了·但是戰爭並沒有在美國和我們可以和它談判貿易協定的任何國家之間發生，這是事實。除了極少數的例外，凡與我們簽訂貿易協定的國家都和我們聯合一致反抗軸心，這也是事實。政治的聯繫，是以經濟的聯繫爲依歸的。</p>

<p>潘議長先後兩次起立致誠摯之慰問詞，略稱：吳市長被問濟大學學生毆導，上海市民至爲扼腕。然吳市長在學生行動逾越常軌時，猶嚴誠警察「不准開槍」，身雖負傷，未中共匪　大事態之陰謀。直至深夜，仍諄諄勸學生復課，其愛護學生之偉大情神，實値得吾人敬佩·少數行兇學生，依法自應嚴懲外，其餘善良學生，相信必能爲市長精神所感召，幡然梅悟。潘議長並表示此次事件，校長應員全責，同濟學生罷課已兩三星期，吳市長爲勸阻學生晋京請願，自上午至中夜，而該校校長整日未在校中，及市長遭受侮辱，方於六時許抵達，此種不負責之學校當局，吾人應要求政府予以處分。且昨日深晚宣司令請各校長領回學生委負陳保泰前往，時市長正與同濟敎授學生代表說話，勸導學生應推派代表十人前往，並爲便於磋商辦法，可組織小組會，不料一部份學生仍不瞭解，一面鼓動喊打，一而向前衝，且竟致石頭與木棍齊飛，市長呢帽被摔，右人以木棍在市長頭上猛擊四五下，市長身被推倒，學生拳打脚踢，而市長猶欲起立禁止警察動手，當時情形，警察有感動至淚下者。當時吳市長身雖被辱，仍以極溫婉之態度云：侮辱是一事，調解又是一事，調解勸導，始終不懈。並而囑代表：　交出侮辱市長之學生。　被開除學生必須離校。　明日立即復課。最後宣司令認爲學生毆辱市長，行動早已越軌，且各校學生混雜一起，乃下令搜查學生身份證，學生由各校校長領同，留校察看。市長以侮辱事小，復課事大，仍剴切勸喩，大部份學生受市長精神感召，表示悔過，允於今日全部復時，尚右數校校長無法找到，若謂此係學生之校外自由行動，學校無法干涉，是豈國家興學之道。國家興學有此現象，前途何堪設想。上次交大學生毆打李副局長，行動乘張，已非朝夕，爲正本淸源，上海　各界自應求政府整飭綱紀。敎不嚴，師之惰，學風不良，校長敎師均應負其責。况同濟學潮逾越常軌，早應解散，惟市長寬大爲懷，祇要復課，除當塲毆辱市長者，依法辦理外，其餘槪不追究。故同濟學生，今日如仍不復課，即應請求政府立予解散，並要求敎育部查明不負責任之國立大學校長，一律撤換。</p>

<p>沈秘書長代表吳市長致謝詞，略謂：同濟大學風潮，醖釀已有兩三星期。前兩天，市長探悉學生將赴京請願，足以影響全市治安，非常焦慮，曾派員勸導，全體赴京，根本不需要。前長學生代表來見，請吳市長親往曉諭，市長乃於昨日前往該校，不料學生如此行爲，實出意外，市長身體受傷，聲嘶力竭，疲乏不堪，今猶未能起床，聞今日各界代表前來慰問，市長非常感謝，特囑兄弟代表感謝諸先生之盛意。</p>

<p>徐寄廎謂：學潮從或不免，從未聞竟致毆辱市長，此種行動，學生不像學生，學校不像學校，實已跡近亂民暴徒，此等學校，不該存在。吾人今日不僅　問市長，應進一步表示具體意見，要維持上海治安，不容亂民暴徒之混跡存在。王曉　稱：學潮形式，愈演愈烈，令人寒心。本人茲自京返，即約束兒女，不許盲從。吳市長有非常之才，應非常之變，受非常之辱。但政府綱紀，應予維持，學生家長，亦應負責。李雲良稱：吳市長此次遭受侮辱，非學生侮辱，乃共匪假手侮辱，直接侮辱市長，間接侮辱全上海市民。交大同濟在昔學風甚好，今受共匪鼓動，假學生名義，進行搗亂。上海市民應右嚴正表示。</p>

<h3 id="c90">浙江外海漁業　加强沿海治安　護衛民生經濟 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿九日訊〕浙江是我國漁業最發達的一省，在沿海九省中，除廣東和山東兩省外，是無輿倫比的。從北緯二十七度十分迄北緯三十度四十分之間廣表四萬餘方浬的漁塲中，港灣錯綜深　，島嶼報列，計有飛雲江與鰲江口外之南北　，甌江口外之玉環列島，椒江及金淸港口外之台州列鳥，三門灣外之南田及魚山，爵漢外之漢山，象山港與甬江口及杭州灣外之舟山羣島等，而舟山漁塲之廣闊優良，堪稱我國東海漁業的重心。較良海港，則以舟山之長　港，三門灣之石浦，和甌江口的溫州爲三大中心。</p>
<p>據浙江建設廳的確實統計，全省現有</p>
<p>大小漁船</p>
<p>一萬一千七百九十七艘海漁戶十萬家，直接從事漁撈的漁民有七二三五二人，問接依漁爲生的亦達三百萬人。主要的漁獲物有四種：即大小黃魚，帶魚，和墨魚（即烏賊）。其他如　魚，鰻魚，鯊魚，鮸魚，比目魚，海蜇，紫菜等，收獲亦盛。卅五年度的漁獲量，共達二百七十二萬六千三百四十担。卅六年度冬季漁汎收獲亦豐，每年漁撈春汎，（從陰曆二月至六月）收獲約佔三分之一，冬汎（從陰曆九月到明年一月）收獲量佔三分之二，所以全年的漁獲量可能超過去年。</p>
<p>浙省大黃魚產於岠港，黃大洋一帶，每年自春分節起至小滿時止，自東南而西北，用大莆網，小對網及流網等船</p>
<p>隨潮捕魚</p>
<p>，產額約値五千億元，（以萬元一斤計，下同）。其中半數，由岱山，岠山的漁廠收集製鮝，或鮮或鹹，都運到寗波，轉銷浙東西，運到上海，轉銷長江下流地區。小黃魚大部集中在舟山羣島的沈家門，自冬末至春初，用大網在佘山洋，桃花，六橫，浪崗等地採捕，年產約値八千億元，運銷也和大黃魚一樣。帶魚的漁捕地在定海，長塗等處，自陰曆九月上旬至十一月中旬，用大對船及福建鈎船採捕，年產約値三千億元，運銷如上。烏賊的產址約値一千億元，在陰曆二月至六月間，用拖網，墨魚籠及照船，墨魚排等漁具在台州列島，舟山羣島一帶採捕，運銷於江西，福建及南洋各地的也很多。其他如鯧魚，　魚等，年產亦達數百億元。在浙江的經濟富源中，外海漁業，確實是佔着重要的一環。</p>
<p>漁民生活</p>
<p>，除了危險性較嚴重外，是比鹽民和農民們較爲豐裕的。抗戰期中，他們受日寇海上封銷的影響，捕魚多方受阻，禍害生計，而且漁船損失極多，數達三五四四艘。勝利以來，救濟總署曾應各漁團之請，核撥大量造船木材，並由省府計劃在寗波等地設置造船廠，以便自造木船救濟。但爲了運輸，經費，和職權等問題，進展比蝸半還慢，政府的另一稱救濟：漁貸，實在也可憐得很。去年冬季漁汎，中國農民銀行在浙江一共只貸了十億元，即溫區三億，台區二億，寧區五億。後來，由地方銀行單獨進行的也有少數。不但手續繁，而且也祗能借到一二千萬，不敷仍甚，所以漁民們只好仰求諸高利貸了。普通一條大船的一季漁汎，所費約需一億，（添置漁具不在內）。像這次</p>
<p>冬季魚汎</p>
<p>旺產，每船可獲一二百担至五六百担，每担市價一百萬元，可獲利數倍，所以他們很願意出三角的高利去借本錢。但是這次漁汎中，二次颶風，曾覆沒了卅餘艘漁船，把性命和生財全煙沒在海洋中，這是漁民的最大不幸。讀過法國小說「冰島漁夫」的人，是很容易想像出這些不幸的漁民底悲慘情緒的。</p>
<p>復員以來，政府在解除漁民的痛苦的工作上，確是盡了相當的力量。魚市塲的設立，便是一大建設。本來漁民的</p>
<p>最大剝削</p>
<p>是漁行，漁行把資本借給漁民，强迫以康價收買漁獲物，從而獲得厚利。現在，由政府成立魚市塲，雖然仍由官商合辦，這一層剝削至少是减輕得多了。目前漁民所切望於政府者，便是海上的治安，由於沿海治安力量本身的不够强大，地區廣闊，海匪流竄潛伏，捕勦不易，而海軍與外海上警察又未能澈底合作，治安始終是個難於解決的問題，漁民出漁，不得不被海匪「寫票」，用錢去接受海匪的「保護」，而且有時候還有「緝私通私」的現象，在沿海一帶發生，所以如何確保海上治安，以護衛浙江沿海民生經濟的命脈，是漁民的最大希望，也是政府的一大重任。</p>

<p>〔本報南獄訊〕湘省南嶽國立師範學院，爲「遷京改大運動」，曾一再向當局呼籲，最近又發表罷課待命宣言，原文如下：</p>
<p>「現在我們帶着悲憤而祈求的心情申訴我們的顧望。</p>
<p>我們知道，罷課是一種慘痛的手段。然而由於事實的退迫，使我們不得不出此下策。記得去年醖釀罷課的當兒，敎育部曾給予我們以相當的答覆，但是一年的時光過去，希望又成了泡影。所以今天，我們誓再以慘重的犧牲，爭取到本院最低限度的生存條件。</p>
<p>在「建國時期，敎育第一」的現階段中，神聖而偉大的責任，已落在我們的雙肩上，我們這一羣師範生不僅只是接受這種專業訓練以從事敎育的實際工作，同時還負有硏究敎育學術的重大使命，我們深深地感到將來責任的艱鉅，和目前環境的困苦，不得不有所呼籲，要求和抗議，罷課就是整個行動的表示！</p>
<p>抗戰期中以自已的血淚生長的國立師範學院，雖則　路籃樓，播遷流離，但他已確切地在敎育上担負起神聖的責任。這個成績優良而賦有全國性的高等師範敎育的學府，勝利之後，自應遷往首都，擴大規模，而囿於當事者一二人之成見，將他置之在南嶽的深山窮谷之間，窒塞了我們的呼吸，束縛了我們的發展，剝奪了我們所負的責任和應得的權利。南嶽只是佛敎崇林，遊覽勝地，而不是高等敎育的學府所能開展的塲所。一年多來，我們不僅在物質上忍受了許許多多的痛苦，尤其是原有的敎授，紛紛離去，新聘的敎授，裏足不前，更加以疾病相通，給予我們精神上莫大的打擊，誰爲厲階，皆山之咎！我們要本院有理想的前途，只有從速離開南獄，遷往南京！</p>
<p>高等師範敎育旣然是一種專業訓練，負有培養中等學校師資及敎育行政人員與硏究敎育學術的重大使命，自應給以相當的培植，和合理的發展。本院是經過了九年的慘淡經營，各方面都已表現着優良的成績，事實具在，無庸贅言，要想中國將來敎育前途有輝煌的成果，必需要建立幾座規模宏遠的師範大學，關念着國家敎育的前途，懍懷着本院重大的使命，我們期望立即改大！</p>
<p>我們不忍說政府對敎育抱着什麼偏見！我們不忍說敎育經費在國家總預算中佔有何項比例！然而我們全院師生早已處在極度困阨的境地之中，我們襤褸，我們饑餓，而我們却又負右重大的使命。我們有希望，我們有信心，而本院却得不到積極地從事建設。這全是爲了經費的不够！在物價狂飛猛躍之中，十萬零九千元一月的副食費，三千元一年的燈油費，濟甚事！十萬元一期的零用金，四十萬元一年的制服費，有何用！這統統是敎育部對我們「惠而不費」的「洪恩大德」！敎育本來是淸苦的事業，總不應該凍餒。敎育需要安定，總不應該毫無發展。把我們禁閉在南嶽的幽谷中，而不給我們最低限度的生存條件，這就是國家的敎育計劃？這次皮院長晋京，只帶著我們起碼的要求，然而交涉毫無結果，當局者對這種敎育忽視的態度，我們應該抗議！</p>
<p>南嶽旣不是我們生存的空間，况且隣近鄂黔滇桂諸省都設有高等師範學院，足可以發展邊區敎育，本院旣爲一全國性的，實無久住南嶽之必要，一年多的山中生活，給我們痛苦太多，使我們犧牲本大，今天，已到了不可容忍的時候了，我們已在一月十四日起開始罷課待命，不得到相當的答復，誓不休止！爲着爭取生存必需的條件，我們不惜付出這重大的代價，然而罷課我們只是認爲一種慘痛的手段！』</p>

<h3 id="c122">綱球大王下海記　克拉茂的一生輝煌戰績 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕前美國台杯主將，業餘綱球冠軍賈克·克拉茂，於去歲十月下海後，隨與當代職業網球盟主李格斯，作週遊美國對抗賽，到目前爲止，總二十一次會戰，克氏獲勝十二次，暫佔優先。</p>
<p>關於克氏轉入職業界的消息，喧傳甚久，直到去年八月初，方才由克氏親自提出答案：「本人的業餘綱球員資格，將保持至一九四七年爲止」。因爲在那—一年以內，克拉茂還須肩負兩項重大的任務：八月三十日至九月一日，在紐約林山，他出任美國隊首席選手，爲保衛「台維斯杯」而與勁敵澳洲隊週旋；其次，九月五日至十四日舉行的林山國際網球大會，他又要爲維持自身享有「男子單打皇座」的榮銜作戰。</p>
<h3 id="c123">美國人民懷著諒解 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>對於克拉茂的準備轉入職業界，美國人民大都懷著諒解的心情，因為前年科季克氏偕同將洛特，祗憑兩人之力，把失落多年的「台維斯杯」，從澳洲重又投入美國的懷抱，這一件大功勞，至今還使他們感念不　。當時，傳說職業界方面願出美金五萬，要求克氏下海。——另一個說法：李格斯（目前的國際職業綱球冠軍）曾向克拉茂表示，勸他放棄業餘資格，保證一年以內，司以替他收穫五萬美金。所以克拉茂爲了替美國保衛去年的合杯，在個人方面，事實上已經損失了一筆很可觀的「年俸」了。</p>
<p>這一個二十七歲，金黃色頭髮的加州少年，身高六尺一寸，體重一百六十八磅，已經做了孩子的父親，因此，他得要爲家庭幸福而爭取地位，對於那一筆誘他下海的現金財富，克拉茂便不得不作考慮了。</p>
<p>克拉茂的生父，在「聯太平洋鐵路公司」服務墾三十五年。不論在如何困難的處境，對於兒子天性愛好的運動，他必定多方設法，供給他一個發展的機會。當克拉茂手裏持着一枚籃球，老克拉茂便替他在後庭中建築了一個籃球塲：倘若見子對棒球發生興趣，父親也就和他在一起遊戲</p>
<p>在克拉茂十二歲的那一年，有一次，他從一塲足球賽罷歸家，鼻部靑腫流血，他的母親見到這個模樣，嚇了一驚，趕緊用三元五角美金，替他買了一副綱球拍，由他們父子倆一同遊戲。</p>
<h3 id="c124">克拉茂的姿勢　打算將來開一家店 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>現在，克拉茂已經一舉成名，他打算將來聚資開設一家「運動用具店」，請他的父親担在經理。他說：「在商塲上，老人家的腦筋是勝似我的。」</p>
<p>克拉茂戰前曾在南加州學院肄業，目前他無意繼續他的學業。報章上的網球文字，以及一些關於狩獵經歷的書籍，槪括了他此刻的閱讀時間，半生以來，他心中單獲抱一個堅固專誠的意念：「我要成爲全球最優良的綱球家」。</p>
<p>遠在他尚未達到十六歲之前，克拉茂已經獲得和那些前輩宿將，如梵恩士，鐵爾頓，潘萊等對抗，得到指聖啓導。梵恩士更和他每週作兩次敎練比賽，——這是加州網球第二代誕生的必經課程，梵氏傳授他「攻擊與力量」。</p>
<p>十七歲時，克拉茂迎奪得「全美靑年」和「全美學童」兩項單打錦標，被指列爲常時全美第十名選手。又被譽作梵恩士再世，因爲克氏外貌，恰蔣梵氏酷似。克氏又和另一加州網球員許洛特合作雙打，連得全國錦標兩年，其時，他祗十九歲，但他並不以此爲滿足。</p>
<p>一九四三年，他進達全美單打決賽，不幸因皮膚中毒，敗於需亨脫。此後，他加入海防隊服務，曾身歷五次太平洋登陸戰，足有十三個月，未握球拍。</p>
<p>前年他赴英參加惠勃爾登賽，因皮膚病發作，敗於捷克國手特洛尼，但克拉茂本人却發表談話，說是擊敗他的確是特落尼，和皮膚病不相干。他不知遁詞，也用不着推諉，後來事實證明：前年九月的林山大會中，他果然奪得單打錦標，造成五次單役，僅失一盤的偉蹟。十二月，他偕許洛特出席合維斯杯賽，爲夷國奪回錦標，建立不可磨的功勳。</p>
<h3 id="c125">夙願旣償宣告下海 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>去年七月，惠勃爾登杯賽在英舉行，全球好手逐鹿的結果，男子單打冠軍一席，仍歸克拉茂掌握，倫敦報紙，譽爲惠勃爾登有史以來量優良球員之一。八月三十日至九月一日，克氏與老搭檔許洛特代表美國隊，爲保衛台杯與澳洲隊作戰，造成單打全捷，以四比一擊潰澳洲隊的戰。九月十四日，在林山全美草地網球單打錦標決賽中，以三比二擊敗派克，蟬聯錦標。夙願旣償，克氏挾此輝惶戰蹟，轉入了職業界。（錢昌年）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會袁主委對棉紡公會決議事項，發表談話稱：第六區棉紡公會會員大會，對於本曾各項管理細則提出要求，其所決議事項，殊不合理，亟應予以糾正如下：</p>
<p>該會員大會議決，代紡代織應以契約行之，凡超越代紡代織範圍，槪難接受一節。</p>
<p>中央此次決定實施花紗布全而管制，係爲經濟戡亂整個政策之一環。政府旣加管制，即得以命令行使一切，在政府之立塲必須貫澈到底，絕不容許有任何妨碍與遠抗之行爲，何得視同普通商業事件，要求以契約行之，其不合理顯而易見。</p>
<p>推舉代表起草，將本業危機發表宣言一節。</p>
<p>政府對於全國紡織工業，無時不在扶植愛護，本人此次出而主持，亦即本此一念，期於管理之中仍能使此紡織工業日趨繁榮。本人就任之始，已度掬誠告諸同業，豈有絲毫摧殘與剝削之意思在。本會各項實施細則內所規定者，已絕對顧全廠商之利益與地位，紡織危機之宣言，實屬庸人自擾。</p>
<p>推舉代表陳述意見及要求一節。</p>
<p>本人爲謀澈底合作，使官商打成一片，故在可能範圍內，可予接受之意見，無不儘量採納。在過去該會各項要求已有事實證明，無待多言。此次六區公會所提六項意見，跡近要挾，在政府之立塲，實屬無法接受。本人對該會全體會員洧不能不寄予深切期望者，以該會各廠主持人，多爲社會夙著聲譽之明達人物，對於事務之公私是非當早已明辨，而不完全注重一己之私利，一如過去之聯合配銷及議價等項工作動輒反對，故該會中少數不甚瞭解之曾負，望能隨時剴喩，免生隔閡</p>
<p>駐廠專員無設置必要，認為　耗國帑，而滋流弊一節。查管理政理政策之實施，能否澈底，端視管理方法之是否合鉀爲斷，本會爲明瞭各廠工作狀况，故”派駐廠人員之規定，而該會竟以無設置必要爲理由，公然反對，實屬可笑。且本會對於擬派駐廠人員之考核甄拔及訓練種種均極嚴格，現在尚未派出，何以知其必有流弊，至謂虛耗國帑，尤與廠商無關，更何得　爲口實。此完全爲不明立塲，藐視政府之言論。</p>
<p>各廠原棉枯渴急待補充，如紗管會不能及時供給被迫停工，其嚴重後果應請紗管會負其全責一節。</p>
<p>本曾統購原棉即爲供應各紗廠之需要，且二季配棉及行總棉花，早由央行轉配，今後由本會接辦，當然按照規定源源配給，如在此時即以被迫停工爲言，是明明危詞聳聽，阻碍要政，意圖破壞全面管理之實施，倘右此種情事，本會爲奉行政令不得不執法以繩。</p>
<p>總之，本會對六區公會全體會員，務望能推誠合作，俾此紡織工業欣欣向榮，一掃從前希圖暴利不顧大局之積習，是實本人所蔪響無窮者。</p>

<p>— 王利器</p>
<p>史記大宛傳，太史公曰：「禹本紀言河出崑崙，……」衛世家，太史公曰：「余讀世家言云云。」趙　陔餘叢考，據此謂「本紀世家，其名皆有所本；獨傳之名，創自史公。」俞灣湖樓筆談三謂「平原君傳徐廣注引魏公子傳曰：「趙惠文王弟。」然則傳之名，亦有所本矣。」</p>
<p>今案趙兪之說，皆有可商：史記三代世表，單行本索隱云：「帝廪辛，或作馮辛，系本紀作祖辛，誤也。」系本即世本，小司馬避唐諱改。左襄二十一年傳：「伊尹放太甲而相之。」杜注：「太甲，湯孫也。」正義云：「太甲湯孫，世本紀文也。「是世本有紀，以載帝王世繫，爲左氏舊體。史記齊田世家：「莊十卒，子太公和立。」索隱云：「今據系本系家，自成子至王建之滅，唯止十代。」左桓三年傳：「曲沃武公伐冀，次於陘庭，韓萬御戎，梁弘爲右。」注：「武公，曲沃莊伯子也，韓萬，莊伯弟也。」正義：「武公莊伯子，韓萬莊伯弟，世本世家文也。」又閔二年傳：「立戴公以廬千曹。」注：「戴公名申。」正義：「戴公名申，世本世家文也。」又襄十一年傳：「七姓十二國之祖。」注：「實十三國，言十二，誤也。」正義：「七姓十三國，世本世家文也。」又定元年：「立煬宮。」注：「煬公，伯禽子也。」正義：「　公伯禽子，世本世家文。」則世家之名，亦出於左氏，不自史公創之。漢書司馬遷傳贊：「故司馬遷據左氏國語，采世本。」（後漢書班彪傳作「太史令司馬遷採左氏國語，删世本。」（是其明微也。至於徐廣引魏公子傳，此蓋亦世本之文，史記魏世家：「桓子之孫，曰文侯都。」索隱：「系本云：『桓子生文侯斯。」其傳云：『孺子類是魏駒之子。」與此糸代亦不同也。」是世本有傳，居然可知。而史記伯夷列傳第一，太史公日：「余悲伯夷之意，睹軼詩，可異焉，其傳曰：伯夷叔齊云云。』」索隱：「按其傳，蓋韓詩外傳及呂氏春秋也。其傳云云。」然則列傳一科，史公蓋亦本之前修。隋書魏澹傳載范嘩之言日：「春秋者，文旣總略，好失事形，今之擬作，所以爲短。紀傳者，史班之所變也，網羅一代事義，周悉通之，後學者此焉爲優，故繼而述之。」（當出後漢書序例。）蓋「古書凡記事立論，及解經者，皆謂之傳，非專記一人事蹟也；其專記一人爲一傳者，則自遷始。」（本廿二史剳記。）蔚宗「紀傳史班之所變」之言，至爲宏達。</p>
<p>趙冀廿二史剳記曰：「史記作十表，眆於局之譜牒，與紀傳相爲出人。」沈濤銅熨斗齋隨筆日，「表猶言譜一聲之轉。」今案趙沈之說皆是也。梁書劉杳傳引桓譚新論云：「太史三代世表，旁行斜上，並效周譜。」（又見史通表歷篇及通志總序引。）是史公作表，本之周譜，漢人已言之。今考史公自言其取用之所資者，三代世表序云：「余讀諜記，黃帝以來，皆有年數，稽其歷譜諜終始五德之傳，古文咸不同乖異。夫子之弗論次其年月，豈虛哉！於是以五帝緊諜，尚書集世，紀黃帝以來訖共和，爲世表。」十二諸侯年表序云：「太史公讀春秋曆譜諜。」又曰：「漢相張　歷譜五德。」又曰「譜課獨記世諡，其辭略，欲一觀諸要難。」太史公自序云：「維三代尚矣，年紀不可考，蓋取之譜牃，荷聞本於茲，於是略推，作三代世表，第一。」又云，「幽萬之後，周室衰微，諸侯專政，春秋有所不記。而譜諜經略，五覇更盛衰。欲睹閱世相先後之意，作十二諸侯年表，第二。」凡此：亦可以考見其材料之來源，及體製之因製者也。</p>
<p>至於書者，禮書索隱云：「書者，五經六籍總名名也。此之八書，記國家大體，班氏謂之志，志，記也。」正義亦云：「五經六籍，咸謂之書。」史通書志篇曰：「夫刑法禮樂，風土山川，求諸文籍，出於三禮。及班馬著史，別裁書志，考其所記，多效禮經。且記傳之外，有所不盡，隻字片文，於斯備錄，語其通博，信作者之淵海也。」今按索隱正義及史通之說，頗爲可從。五經六籍，大半爲說典章之書，太史公八書，不獨其大名本之於經籍，即其取用之所資者，亦可從經籍中得其消息。班書以後，有直探史公名書之旨而稱典者，其稱名較之班志蔡意之流，尤爲近古云。</p>
<p>上來所述數端，於太史公書體裁探原，或能得其彷彿。而文心雕龍史傳篇云：「爰及太史談，世惟執簡；子長繼志，甄序帝動。比堯稱典，則位雜中賢，法扎題經，則文非元聖。故取式呂覽，通號日紀。紀綱之號，亦宏稱也。」淸人晏世澍，承彥和遣說，作太史公本紀取式呂覽辦，又見沅湘通藝錄卷二。會稽章學誠作校　通義，亦謂「呂氏之書，蓋司馬遷之所取法也：十二本紀，倣其十二月紀，八書，倣其八覽；七十列傳，倣其六論；則亦微有所以折衷之也。」此皆不根之談也。</p>

<p>— 適之</p>
<p>楊樹達先生寄錢玄同先生</p>
<p>玄同先生：</p>
<p>前天見告胡適之先生解釋「于以采　于　于　』等『于以』之于字爲『在何處』，語氣極爲相台。惟釋「于」爲在何處，不知『以』字胡先生如何安頓。我想『于』字依然還是在字的意思，而以字却可有『何處』的解釋。尚要『夏罪其如台』，『今王其如台』；史記都把「如台」譯作『奈何』漢書敍傳『如合不匡』，法言『顏民之子其如台』。『如台」都是『奈何」之義。台字从目的說，旣有「何」義，然則目字與合同聲，亦當有何字之義。旣有『何』義，引申亦可有『何處』之義。（如焉字即是）如此則于以采　？于沼于沚。于以求之？于林之下。上下文句的「于」字可以解釋一律，而「以」字較有著落，不致成為贅疣。不知道您和胡先生以爲何如。</p>
<p>「于」字有「以」字之義，我從前曾證明過。（古雲疑義舉例補內）那麼翻過來說，以字也可有于字之義。若是釋『于』爲何處，又釋『以』爲『于』，未免太糾纏了。您說如何？祝健康樹達</p>
<p>錢玄同先生寄胡適</p>
<p>適之：</p>
<p>楊遇夫來信，討論「于以」的問題，我覺得他很有見解。他所舉的『于以求之，于林之下』那句，很可研究。『如台』的「台」字，前人似乎都認爲『何」字的轉音，這雖然勉强可說，但聲　似乎都還差些。（『台』古音在影紐咍　，價定為　『何』古音在匣紐　　，　　為　。）若『以』字有『何』義，則『台』字便不必與『何』字　奉合了。「以」古作「　　」，『台』古作「　」，从目（　以）聲，鍾『姒』字有作「始」者，皆可爲二字通用之證。但不知楊君所證，其中尙有格義否？你的意見何如？均希示知。弟玄同（一九二二，十，三）</p>
<p>二十多年前，我開始研究詩經裏的虛字。那時我曾指出「于以采　，于沼于　」，「于以用之，公侯之事」，等等句子，都是上句問，下句答。在那兒采　呢？在沼在沚。在那兒用他呢？在公侯之事。這是一班朋友都贊成的。但我當時特別注意「于」字作副詞用的許多例十，如「于飛」　飛焉　在那兒飛。「于歸」　歸焉　歸到那見。所以我最初曾主張「干以」是一種倒裝的上古文法，同「是以」「何以」「所以」是一類的。「于」是「何處」，或「什麼」，而「以」是倒裝的「介詞」。這個說法，在召南采蘋篇「干以盛之？維筐及筥。于以湘之？維錡及釜。」似乎更說的通。這兩處「于以」與「何以」的文法很相同。</p>
<p>後來楊遇夫先生知道了這個說法，寫信給錢玄同先生，提議把「以」字解作「何」字，而「于」字仍是介詞。這個說法好像比我的原議更容易懂，所以玄同和我後來都接受他了。胡適，一九四八，一，廿三</p>
<h3 id="c142">「吹蕭給喪事」說 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 邢公畹</p>
<p>兪正　「癸已存稿」（這筠　叢書）卷之十一「吹簫給喪事」條中謂：</p>
<p>史記周勃世家云：一以織薄曲爲生，常爲人吹簫給喪事。」集解如淳曰：「以樂喪賓，若俳優。」臣瓚曰：「吹簫以樂喪賓，若樂人也。」索隱云：「左傳「歌處殯』，若今挽歌，類歌者或右蕭管也。」漢書勃傳注，師古用瓚說。今按：索隱言是也。蕭非編簫，乃　簫，亦謂之鼓吹；謂簫之簧，鼓以吹之；自是秦漢喪儀，非關樂賓。蓋「鼓吹」二義：是短簫。宋書樂志云：「鼓吹蓋短簫鐃歌。」郭茂倩樂府解題云：「鼓吹，短簫鐃歌；，橫吹，跂角是也。」一是作樂之名。漢書韓延壽傳云：「鼓車，吹車，及諸傳鹵簿鼓吹，」陳琳檄云：「登高岡而擊鼓吹。」宋趙昇朝野類要云：「鼓吹，禮部之太常樂。蓋雅樂爲軍門轅門所奏，無鍾磐塤柷琴瑟，但鼓鈸鐃　吹金第簫笛是也。」喪事行車，用短　以節行止；又以人死使人勿惡，非爲樂賓。其後乃用鈴鐸。晋書五行志云：「海西公時，瘦晞挽歌，搖大鈴。」又，梁時謝幾卿執鐸挽歌。唐制，挽郞與執鐸代哭者同衣績。太平廣記李娃傳：二肆傭凶器者較能，擁鐸而進，亦所以節行止。總括兪氏的意見，乃是以爲</p>
<p>一·短簫亦謂之鼓吹，而鼓吹蓋有二義，一是短簫鐃歌。</p>
<p>二·喪事行車，用短簫以節行之。</p>
<p>三·喪事行車，用短簫以節行之，其後乃用鈴鐸。</p>
<p>此皆賢者千慮之一失。按郭茂倩書中，鼓吹曲辭載漢鐃歌十八首，中無挽歌。而相和歌辭中有古辭三十二曲，「　露」「蒿里」在焉。通志樂略謂：「亦曰『天地喪歌』，亦曰『挽柩歌』。』晋書樂志云：『凡樂章古辭之存者，並漢世街陌　謠：『江南可採蓮』，『島生十五子』『白頭吟』之屬，其後漸被之管絃，即『相和』諸曲是也。』宋書樂志：『相和』，漢舊曲也；絲竹更相和，執節者歌。』故挽歌重在唱，但就其可和來說，周勃吹簫仍與挽歌爲一事。周勃所吹之簫（及史記所載伍子胥乞食於吳市中所吹）容或爲短簫，但不必釋爲鼓吹。兪氏之所以釋短簫爲鼓吹，蓋由「喪事行車，用短簫以節行止。」之一念橫梗於心。因「節行止」，故用軍門轅門所奏樂。但事實上，「發引』固用挽歌，即在家中行「祖載」之禮時亦用挽歌，如宋書（卷六十九）范嘩傳云：</p>
<p>曄遷尚書吏部郞，元嘉元年冬，彭城王太妃薨，將葬，「祖」夕，僚故並集東府。嘩弟廣淵，時爲司徒祭</p>
<p>酒，其日在値。曄與司徒左曹屬王深，及弟廣淵宿，夜中酣飲，開北牗聽挽歌爲樂。彭城義康大怒，左遷嘩宣城太守。</p>
<p>而且在漢朝的時候，結婚宴客，亦有用挽歌助興者，如應劭，風俗通（御覽卷五五二引）云</p>
<p>京師賓婚嘉會，酒酣之後，續以挽歌。則與節喪車行止之事更無關了。挽歌旣重在唱，而吹簫者即不能同時兼唱，庾晞搖鈴，幾卿執鐸，以及李娃傳中歌者擁鐸而進，乃是一面歌唱，一面搖鈴，搖鈴所以爲執歌節，非節喪車行止（李娃傳所載挽郞登榻而歌，其後並無喪車相隨。），故鈴鐸並非短簫之替代。司馬貞謂：「左傳『歌處殯』（按在哀公十一年。杜預注：「處殯，送葬歌曲。」），若今挽歌，類歌者或右簫管也。」則在唐時，蓋仍右以簫管和挽歌者，所謂「絲竹更相和」也，亦即所謂「吹簫給喪事」也；而擁鐸而進，即是「執節者歌」也。惟後世以簫管相和者似已甚少，故李娃傳中所載，只他以其挽郞相讚和矣。又如後漢書（卷十大）禮儀志云：</p>
<p>禮，登遐……羽林孤兒巴兪擢歌者六十人，爲六列鐸司馬八人執鐸。</p>
<p>此八人爲歌者，而六十人爲和者也。莊子大宗師云</p>
<p>子桑戶，孟子反，子琴張，三人相與友……子桑戶死，未葬，孔子開之，使子貢往侍事焉。或編曲，或鼓琴，相和而歌日：「嗟來桑戶乎！嗟來桑戶乎！而已反其傎，而我猶爲人猗。」</p>
<p>成玄英疏「侍事」即爲「供給喪事」；而「編曲」當亦即周勃世家之「織薄曲」也。成疏又云。</p>
<p>「嗟來」，歌聲也。「桑戶乎」以下，相和之辭也。「猗」相和聲也。故挽歌之爲「喪儀」，司能在秦漢以前。檀弓所載：原壤母死，登木而歌。又，莊子妻死，亦歧盆而歌。當皆有其風俗之背景。然儒家對喪禮，主「顏色之戚，哭泣之哀」（孟子，滕文公）；故禮記曲禮云：「里有殯，不巷歌，」論語亦云：「子食於右喪者之側，未嘗飽也；子於是日哭，則不歌。」（皇本此二章相連）故挽歌之俗，與儒家精神不相容，經典因不見載。儒家對當時禮俗，「述而不作」，只使其理性化；且凡不合其精神的，均爲所摒棄。就喪葬而言，殺生以送死（有子，禮論），焚之，露之，衣薪而棄諸溝壑，（列子，楊朱篇）皆爲儒家所不取，是有其選擇，有其理論的。就大宗師所載者看，當即是一種挽歌，而史記的周勃吹蕭，莊子的「或鼓琴」，即是指絲竹相和而言；原壤的叩本，莊子的鼓盆，即是執節。蓋此俗儒家雖不取，道家却將牠理性化了。</p>
<p>此俗元明時仍流行，故水滸傳（第二十三回）載「棺材出了，討挽歌郞錢」之諺。　（三六，九，廿八，過錄畢。）</p>

<p>— 季羨林</p>
<p>在所有的中國長篇小說裏，除了紅樓夢以外，我最喜歡的就是儒林外史。平常翻看雜書的時候，遇到與需林外史有關的材料，就隨時寫下來。現在把筆記拿出來一看，居然已經寫了很多。其中有許多條別的學者也注意到過（參閱魯迅小說舊聞鈔，孔另境中國小說史料，蔣瑞藻小說考證）。但還有幾條是以前任何學者沒有注意到過的，而這幾條據我看對儒林外史取材來源的問題又可以給我們許多啓示，所以我就在下面鈔下來談一談。</p>
<p>尤侗艮齊雜記說：</p>
<p>庵官知府時，終日以圍棋度曲自娛。長官。諷言曰：「聞君署中終日只聞棋聲，笛聲，曲聲，是否」？袁曰：「然聞。明公署中終日亦有三聲」。畏官問何聲。袁曰：「是算盤聲，天秤聲，板子聲耳」。長官大盡，遂劾之落職。</p>
<p>褚人穫堅瓠集十集卷一也記載了同一個故事：</p>
<p>又聞先生（袁　庵）在武昌時，某巡道謂曰：「聞貴府衙中有二聲：　子聲，唱曲聲」。先生對曰：「老大人也有二聲：天平聲，竹爿聲」，某默然，未幾先生遂掛彈章。</p>
<p>這兩條筆記都能的是袁　庵一個人的事，大槪是根據的事實。需林外史第八回也有一個相同的故事：</p>
<p>前任臬司向家說道：「聞得貫府街門裏有三樣聲息。」王守道：「是那三樣？」　公子道：「是吟詩聲，下聲聲，唱曲聲。」王太守笑道：「却也有趙的緊。」　公子道：「將來老先生一番振作，只怕要換三樣聲息。」王太守道：「是那一樣？」聽公子道「是戰子聲，算盤聲，板子聲。」</p>
<p>這裏有兩個可能：　守或者就是影射的袁　庵，或者影射的另外一個人，而吳敬梓却把袁　庵的故事借來用到他身上。</p>

<p>古閨秀能詩者多，何至今　沓然？余宰江寗時，有松江女張氏二人，寓居尼庵，自言文敏公族也。姊名宛玉、嫁淮北程家，與夫不協，私行脫逃。山陽令行文關提。余點解時，宛玉堂上獻詩云：「　湖深處素聲花，誤入淮西估客家得遇江州白司馬，敢將幽怨訴琵琶。」余疑倩人作，女請面試。予指庭前枯樹爲題。女曰：「明府旣許婢子吟詩，詩人無跪禮。請假紙筆立吟可平？」余許之。乃倚儿疾書曰：「獨立空庭久，朝朝向太陽。何人能手植，移作後庭芳？」未幾山陽馮令來，予問張氏女作何辦，曰：「此事不應斷離；然才女嫁俗商，不稱。故釋其背逃之罪，且放歸矣。」問何以知其才。日：「渠獻詩云：「泣訴神明宰，容奴返故鄉。他時化蜀烏，銜結到君旁。」馮故四川人也。</p>
<p>這不完完全全就是儒林外史第四十回和第四十一回寫的女詩人沈瓊枝嗎？</p>
<p>酉陽雜爼卷一說：</p>
<p>天賓末，交趾貫龍腦，如蟬蠶形。波斯言，老龍腦，樹節方有。禁中呼爲瑞龍腦。上唯賜貴妃十枚。香氣徹十餘步。上夏日嘗與親王暮，令賀懷智獨彈琵琶。貴妃立於局前觀之。上數子將輸，貴妃放康國猧子於坐側，猧子乃上局，局子亂，上大悅。時風吹貴妃領巾於賀懷智巾上，良久回身方落。賀懷智歸，覺滿身香氣非常，乃卸撲頭，貯於錦囊中。及上皇復宮闕，逍思貴妃不己，懷智乃進所貯幙頭，具奏他日事。上皇發囊泣曰：「此瑞龍腦香也。」</p>
<p>儒林外史第五十三回也有一個類似的故事：</p>
<p>陳木南又要輸了。聘娘手裏抱了烏靈蓋雪的貓。</p>
<p>望上一撲，那棋就亂了。道同楊貴妃的故事完全一樣。我不相信，這是偶合，我覺得這是吳敬梓有意的借用。</p>
<p>以上一共舉了三個例子。僅就這三個例子說，我覺得我們就應該把自來對儒林外史取材來源的看法修正一下了。一般人都以爲儒林外史裹的人物大都是實有其人，上元金和的跋就開了一個名單。以後別人也作過同樣的推測。我不否認，書中人物有很多是影射的傎人；但倘若說，人旣然是傎的，事情也就應該是眞的，這就有了問題。張鐵臂的故事完全鈔自桂苑叢談，道別的學者也已經指出來過。我們在上面第三個例子裏又指出來聘娘的故事鈔襲的楊貴妃故事。這只是兩個例子，實際上儒林外史借用以前筆記或小說的地方絕不會就祇是這兩處。從這裏我們可以看出來，吳敬梓並不傎是想替這些需林裏的人物立傳，他是在作小說，同別的小說家一樣。在以前的小說或筆記裏，只要看到有用的材料，他就搜集起來，　到他自己的書裏。倘若讀者傎正相信這書裏新寫的部是實有其人，實有其事，聽了金和的話到　乾問諸家文集裏去搜尋，那就會徒勞無功了。</p>

<p>戰時，有一架飛機在西北地方不幸失事，隔了五十二小時，空軍司令部的偵察機發現了飛機的殘骸，於是立刻派遣人員降陸尋找機師下落，這是一個一望無際的大沙漢，結果機師的屍體在離飛機二里路光景地方找到，身旁還帶着二袋乾糧，可是腕間的血管。被咬破，口腔舌間，全是斑斑血痕，原來他囚爲三天內得不到一滴水，雖然微倖沒在飛機跌下來時死亡，但終於乾渴時咬破自己的血管，冀圖喝一口血來潤潤喉嚨，沒有水渴的痛苦，可以想見。</p>
<p>十八世紀中棄，當英國勢力正在印度積極擴展的時候，孟加拉地方的印度總督把一百四十六個英國人拘禁在一間長闊不過方丈的小屋子裏，這所屋子一共只有二個小窗洞，過了一夜，當英國政府交涉而將他們釋放的時候，只有二十三個近小窗洞的人活着出來，其餘一百二十三個人全部窒息而死，臉上痛苦的表情，更非言語所能形容，這就是歷史上著名的「黑牢案」（Black　Hole　of　Cllcntta）。</p>
<p>相傳古時菲洲地方有一個殘忍的酋長，他把他的囚犯關在牢獄裏，給吃給喝給穿給住，可是就不准他們睡覺，想蓋種種辦法，不讓囚犯們有機會闔上眼皮，二天後，囚犯們疲倦得了不得，雖然在皮鞭抽打下，依然呼呼入睡，最後，不到四天，這批可憐的人們，就在這種特殊殘酷的刑罰下喪生，死時凸出二隻充滿血絲的眼珠，全身的血液發黑，直似一個夜叉鬼。</p>
<p>水，空氣，睡眠，全是最平凡最普通不過的東西，住在海濱的我們，更永遠沒有受着缺乏水的痛苦；儘你大口的吸大口的呼，空氣也取之不竭用之不盡，每晚八小時充足的睡眠，也似乎不覺得沒有了睡眠的苦處。然而世　上的事物，愈是平凡，愈是普通，也就愈是重要，愈是不可或缺，所謂一生病的時候才感到健康的實貴，埀死的人才知道生命的可愛」。方今百物昂貴，假使水和空氣也得化錢買的話，囤積水和空氣的一定大不乏人，並且可以保證比囤米囤柴還容易發財。可惜造物弄人，要是食物也像貨浦江水一樣，世界上的紛爭，豈不是可以大大地打上一個折扣？</p>

<h3 id="c145">杜魯門的秘書 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>五十年之前，却爾斯·格里飛滋·羅斯和哈利·杜魯門在密蘇里州獨立城的同一所學校內上課，隔離他們兩人的祇是幾隻課桌。今天，他們兩人又一同在美國總統府內辦公，僅有兩門之隔。他們的生活在靑年時代就已緊密的述繫在一起，互相深切的了解。但是，當人們問羅期他與杜魯門如何互相稱呼時，他却含有歉意似的回答說二「我稱呼他總統先生，而他却祇呌我爲却利。」</p>
<p>羅斯的辦公室內有一方厚重中　地毯，一隻黑色的爐子，牆壁作豆綠色，上面掛着他的兩個見子的照片。除此之外，還有一張他的前任斯蒂夫·歐萊的大照片和兩張杜魯門的照片。從他的窗戶向外望去是一片草地，悅人心目。整個的房間的格調是平靜而安寗，這正配合羅斯的個性。</p>
<p>他的藍色的眼睛是柔和的，可是並不馴從。他的個子消瘦，有一點俯腰曲背。他的下巴微突鼻子頗大。他的個性大部份表現在他的下巴上，雖然他的眼睛也表示一部份。假如必需的話，他能够堅韌，但是他也能够柔和。這全在他的眼睛中表現出來。</p>
<p>羅斯原是一個新聞界的人物。在一九三一年他寫過一篇枇評當時的美國總統胡佛的行政　文章，得了警立哲獎金。在他　一九四五年進入白宮之前，他是聖魯斯斌的「先遺郵報」的重要編輯人員，也是美關新聞界的一個顯赫人物。他原沒有到自宮去的意思。這一種職務的變換表示離開他所喜愛的工作和收入的减少—報館的年薪是三萬五千元，而杜魯門僅付他一萬元。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統堅邀他担任他的新開秘書，而「先遺郵報」的主人約瑟夫·普立哲却不放他走。逼得杜魯門打電話給他，說這次的邀請是他以總統的地位所頒的命令。後來「先遺郵報」在前頁報道說：「杜魯門綁架羅斯」。</p>
<p>羅斯替杜魯門所能需的力量是顯明的。他具有華府的最聰敏的政治的心靈之一，還具有準確的預測反應的特長。他給杜魯門對許多人的廣泛的認識。在他的差不多每天舉行一次的記者招待會席上，他替他的主人解了不少次的　。</p>
<p>羅斯每天早晨在八點半就到了辦公室，一小時之後晋謁總統，然後處理一天的事務。他的最重要的任務就是在記者招待會中代表總統發言。羅斯在新聞界中服務過四十年，他深知新聞記者的習性，所以，他懂得迎合，也懂得規避，對答得恰到好處。</p>
<p>在未進白宮之前，羅斯對杜魯門昇任大總統就不遺餘力的加以譽揚。於一九四五年四月在「先遣郵報「上撰文論道：「人們稱杜魯門爲一個普通的美國人，但是，他實較普通人高强。他不是一個無足輕重的人物。他也許不會成爲一個偉大的總統，可是，他一定會成爲一個好總統。」</p>
<p>五十年以前，從獨立城到華盛頓，羅斯和杜魯門一直是一對同舟共濟的朋友，美國人說他們兩人，是美國的「第一號的合作隊」（No.　I　Team）。</p>
<p>觀察週刋主編儲安平君在其「我們建議政府調查並公布白報紙配給情形」一文中，有言云：「以本刊論，我們在三十五年九月創刊時，紙價祗有二萬五千元一令，現在漲到一百五十萬元左右約漲六十倍之多，但是我們創刊時的售價，祗有五百元一份，即以本期增售七千元一份的售價言，本刊的售價亦僅上漲十四倍。這個在同一時期內，紙價已漲六十倍，售價祗漲十四倍，都是確確實實的事實，而其對比的强烈，則令人看後不禁心弦震盪。除非報紙，書籍，或者雜誌它的銷路或者它的售價能與白報紙的價格作比例的增加，否則終將血乾汗盡，垮了完事。</p>
<p>備君所舉的事實都是事實，但要報紙書籍雜誌的售價與白報紙價格作比例的增加，即報紙自三十五年九月起漲了六十倍，日報書籍雜誌也跟着漲到六十倍，是不大合理的論調。因爲我們知道一報一書成一雜誌之成，白報紙不過是成分之一，此外還有稿費排印工等，均缺一不可，除非一報一書或一雜誌的支出均照白報紙的價格作比例的增加，否則其售價而欲獨照上漲最多的白報紙價格比例增加，是頗不合理的算法，決非我文化界所應做出來或說出來的</p>
<p>依理而已，稿子是書刊的最重要原料，讀者出錢買書買雜誌是要看文章，而非圃白報紙，故文章價値應在白報紙之上。這在戰前是確乎如此，有些雜誌—生活與華年週刊等的稿費有千字十餘元者，即作家千字之値，可購白報紙二三令至四五令之，普通是三五元千字，也有一令紙價。而今則如何？白報紙是戰後價格上漲最瘋最狂物品之一，文人心血恐難高攀。但以稿費與排工並論，總是天公地道之說而非文人的痴心妄想吧，事實又何如？我知戰前排工，千字不過五六角，稿費最普通的以千字三元計，也値排工之六倍左右。現在排工爲千字八萬餘（最近不知又漲了沒有），而稿費有那家書店雜誌社或報館一般出到四五十萬元一千字？我知道目前一般稿費多在排工之下而少有在排工之上者，肯付倍於排工的稿費已是難得的「從　致　」。這也就是說：排工比之戰前約漲丫四五萬價，而稿費一般而論僅漲三四萬倍。</p>
<p>那麼雜誌的售價比戰前漲了多少倍呢？事實一般漲了十四五萬倍，恰好與排工並價齊驅，比白報紙不足（以百五十萬論約漲三十萬倍）而比稿費有餘。也就是說文人命苦，把心血賠貼給白報紙了。</p>
<p>然而文人之命是由出版人定之的。如出版人而不存心蔑視作家，稿費至少可照排工比例增加。當然囉，這樣一來售價或許要增了，讀者的負担因而加重。然而讀者應該加重此負担，蓋議者旣非爲白報紙排印工之漲價而增加員担不可，對於因增加稿費而增加的負担更屬義不容辭—他們原爲的要讀文章而出餞的。</p>
<p>目前的委屈作者稿費奇低，老實說完全因爲出版人根本沒有把作者放在心上。最好的證據是他們每次增高售價總說「本刊因紙價飛漲（或印刷工價突增）不得不自本期起增價若千」，從來沒右說過：「本刊從本期起增加售若干，因稿費從上期起已增若干。」好像文章之於雜誌，簡直是種無足重輕的東西，而作者之在人類中，又是不食人間烟火的仙人或擁資億萬萬的豪富。</p>
<p>但即使作者是仙人或豪當吧，出版人也應我盡我心，合理的增加稿費，仙人或豪富不要，儘可代爲捐贈難民，何况一般作者本人正是難民。</p>
<p>目前稿費之低得荒乎其唐，我不敢說是出版者剝削作者，欺侮作者是無可否認的—倘作者而如印刷業之有同業公會，說千字要若干萬元，否則不寫，我想出版人只有「是是」之一法吧？</p>
<p>介之推不言祿祿亦不及，文人學士羞爭稿費，稿費也就此不增，本也不足爲奇，但文化文化什麼什麼之聲從此也就與本官上任爲國爲民之類差不大多了。</p>
<p>一個三歲的孩子傑美，掉在家中附近的一口井裏，想要把他救起來，保全生命，希望極少。井口直徑只有二呎，到四呎之下，圓圈的直徑縮至十四吋，周圍是砂泥，一攪動便要陷成窟窿。二十二呎以下，井口圓徑又狄縮了，僅剩八吋：只有烟肉管這樣粗細。小孩便是掉到了井深的最狹處。</p>
<p>他父親用電筒照過，只看見孩子的頭部，想拋一條繩子下去，把他吊上來，沒有成功；孩子太幼小，速拉牢繩索的力量都沒有。他將逐漸窒息而死。</p>
<p>井太狹窄，平常成人爬到幾呎之深，便無法深入，又不便挖掘井圈，砂泥太鬆，一旦陷落，等於把孩子活埋。</p>
<p>十七歲的靑年黎黎次曼情願自告奮勇，下井救人。他自承身體瘦小，可以穿進狹隘的井圈，用手抱住了孩子，腰部預先繫好繩索，等地面的人拉起來。黎次曼第一次下去，（頭部先探下去，倒身入內），在十五呎深處，肩部臀部已經貼緊井壁，光錢隔絕，看不淸井底的孩子，弄得頭目昏眩，又因空氣隔絕，幾乎窒息而死，地面上的人廢然把他拉了出來。</p>
<p>二分鐘後，作再度嘗試。這次到達十八呎深處，他用手撑着，扭曲身體，想更進數呎，達到可以用手拉住孩子的一點。可是在沒有接近孩子之前，昏厥過去，又被上面吊了起來。第三次下井，才握住孩子的手腕，上面守候者綏緩拉起繩索，黎次曼與小孩才脫出了井圈的牢籠。黎次曼感到昏眩，頭痛，皮膚擦碎，但過了數小時即恢復體力。</p>
<p>這種見義勇爲的精神立即獲得報酬，卡內芝義勇基金國（Carnegie　Hero　Funnd　Commission）獎予銀章一枚，現款五百元。頒發獎金之前，卡內芝調查員先要偵查井深及其圓徑，並須有目繫救濟者簽名蓋章的報告書。如其對於事實有懷疑之處，調查員要覆演一次從井救人的表演，把一個模型小孩擲到井底，親自脚朝天，頭向下的到井裏去試上一試。</p>
<p>有一艘獨木船，在哈里法克司港口翻身，其時有一位麥凱勃夫人，新病初愈，身體還很虛弱，正値三十六歲壯年，站在岸邊，目擊慘事。獨木舟中兩個少年，在水中掙扎，夫人本顧一切，涉水而下，游到他們近傍。一個少年已經沉沒，智覺全失，她潛身水底，一把拖住少年，其時有一童子在港口船上，也聞警來救。麥凱勃把他拖近小船，奮勇把昏迷的少年推上船來。於是她再去救另一少年，也把他推上救生船中；她的手臂已覺麻痺，全身乏力，還自動爬上小船，帮着童子載了兩個幾乎溺死的少年搖到岸邊。兩個少年得慶更生，她則以虛弱之體，受寒受潮，休養了好久才復原。</p>
<p>基金團嘉獎要凱勃夫人的英勇，贈以古銅獎牌，並現款五百元。她可以藉此買些亟欲購置的傢私。</p>
<p>英國小說家塞克賴（Thackeray）說：「勇敢永不落伍」，此卡內芝義勇基金團之以嘉獎見義勇爲的人們爲賣無旁貸也。</p>

<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>皇冠雜誌有常見而不置見的一欄，名「辭類新詮」，用另一種角度的看法去解釋一個字眼。例如「沙發」，他們的詮釋是：「很難找到空著不坐的椅子」，高爾夫球的詮釋是「把一個小球打到一個不知比它大幾億倍大球的空隙中去的一種游戲」等等。這一種新法詮解除了別具會心之外，有機智，嘲諷，冷笑的成份在內—不過好像一說便俗</p>
<p>不知是否蕭翁伯納說過的，中國人是不大懂得幽默（包括機智，嘲諷，冷笑）的民族，記不淸楚了，總之是有這樣一句批評聽到過。其實假如你留心的話，中國人實在也很懂得機智，嘲諷，冷笑之道，或者我們的妙文不大能够普遍刊載，又少人們肯熱心翻譯，使這種精彩文字流傳到西洋去，因之被外國人認爲中國人不懂得幽默了。還看呢，中國人看文章歡喜先看作者的署名，是老舍，老向；好的，一定是幽默文章，一定「話中右因」。殊不知老舍老向輩，還用了其他筆名寫，因爲簽名不熟悉，便望望然去之，好文軍放在眼前不去拜讀，也是湮沒無聞的原因之一。</p>
<p>在行動上表演出「辭類新詮」式的幽默者，最近我們看到了本市某律師的爲了一筆小到不能再小數目的欠資而向法院控告郵政局的事件。我所以不提出某律師的名字，因爲並非想爲他標榜，因之如別人會聯想到是律師的出風頭主義等等，我覺得這種控告，在硏究法律的人看來，這是完全正確的一種舉揹，雖然法院已經判決某律師是敗訴了。這控案的敗訴是必然的，因爲立法院已經爲了這事向政院爭執，結果由於國務會議通過的郵資加價，可以不經立法程序而付實施，則某律師的控訴失敗，乃是必然之理。我們不談施政，不管成敗，單就莫律師的行動看來，簡直是可愛的幽默，對違情的舉措做着皇冠雜誌上面「辭類新詮」式的工作！莊子說：日月之出也，而爝火不息，其於興也，不亦難乎？一種為常人所不屑為，不願為的事，竟有人「肯頂了石臼做戲」，正如不息的爝火，使這個缺少生動趣味的世界上，爆出了一朶活躍的火花。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a luncheon at his official residence on the 30th for Zhang Qun, Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Weng Wenhao, and Shen Yi, seeking their advice and holding discussions. According to well-informed sources, Wei Demai (Wedemeyer) recently sent a document to Chairman Chiang, offering suggestions on finance, resources, transportation, and other matters. The document included proposals for reforming our currency system, developing resources, and constructing transportation infrastructure, with particular emphasis on improving water conservancy in South China. After receiving the document, Chairman Chiang immediately instructed experts to formulate opinions. It is reported that the issues discussed at the Chairman's luncheon on the 30th were related to this matter. Late in the evening, reporters selectively inquired with the attendees, but they were unwilling to disclose any information, although they did not deny it either.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] On the 28th, Secretary of State Marshall held his first direct, formal discussion with the head of our technical delegation, Bei Zuyi, regarding the US aid to China plan. The plan is currently under review by President Truman's National Advisory Council. It is expected that the plan, after undergoing the necessary review by the Bureau of the Budget, will be finalized in the short term. Subsequently, it will be submitted to President Truman for final approval, after which Truman will submit the plan to Congress, possibly with a special message requesting prompt passage. However, it is not yet known when the plan can be completed and passed, or the details of the procedures by the Bureau of the Budget and Truman. No information is available regarding the nature of the plan and when it will be submitted to Congress.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Premier Zhang Qun's statement on China's ten economic reform plans was published by various newspapers in Washington on the 29th, but without comment. The Washington Post's headline was "China Proposes Self-Help Plan." The Times Herald reported "China Guarantees Fiscal Reform." None of the newspapers published the full text. Furthermore, when a reporter inquired with Marshall about Premier Zhang's plan, he declined to comment, but said that the ten plans would be considered, without providing detailed explanations.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Committee of Participating Councilors of the National Political Council held a regular meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Mo Dehui. First, the Secretariat read a written report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the content of the report can be found in another article). Then, Gu Zhenggang was invited to report on the recent social administration facilities and the situation of refugee relief. Subsequently, the committee discussed and passed the following motions:</p>
<p>*   Yu Nanqiu and others proposed that the government adjust the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants monthly according to the cost of living index and maintain the original in-kind allocation method to increase work efficiency.</p>
<p>*   Wu Xu and others proposed that the government reconsider the in-kind allocation method for public school teachers and civil servants. It was resolved that the above two motions would be discussed together and forwarded to the government for attention.</p>
<p>*   Wu Zhaoxu and others proposed: That the government promptly adopt effective measures that address both the symptoms and the root causes to salvage the crisis in North China and win back popular support. It was resolved to pass the motion and forward it to the government for prompt action (the measures are listed in another article).</p>
<p>*   Wu Zhaoxu and others proposed: That the government instruct the Executive Yuan to reconsider the return of the ownership of the Mentougou coal mine. It was resolved to pass the motion and forward it to the government, instructing the Executive Yuan to carefully consider it.</p>
<p>*   Yu Nanqiu and others proposed that the government pay close attention to the US economic recovery plan for Japan. The resolution was amended and passed, requesting the government to pay close attention. (The motion pointed out: Before the peace treaty is finalized, we should not unilaterally and actively support the enemy country. Passively maintaining the livelihood and developing light industry in Japan is acceptable, but actively restoring it to pre-war levels, especially producing three million tons of steel annually, is tantamount to arming Japan. If this matter is realized, then the United Nations will have been placed outside the equation by the United States. How can this be allowed! It is proposed that the government instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay close attention and report to this committee at any time with any concerning developments.)</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of members of the Executive Yuan's Special Donation Supervision Committee to participate in the National Political Council, Lu Qian, Jiang Yong, and Jin Weixi were selected.</p>

Regarding the Shamian incident, the Ministry of Interior has sent personnel to investigate.

<p>[Our Newspaper] Lin Chongyong, Director of the Hankou Financial Management Bureau, arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the 27th of this month, met with the authorities to report on the establishment of the bureau in Hankou, and arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 30th after completing his official business. Lin told reporters that his mission in Shanghai was to meet with President Zhang and Vice President Liu of the National Bank of China to consult on how to use the large amount of capital in Hankou to put it on the right track and to ensure reasonable protection for productive enterprises. After the establishment of the Hankou Financial Management Bureau, it shut down 47 illegal private banks. In order to facilitate the aggregation and management of funds, the three clearing houses in Hankou were merged into one. There are a total of 58 banks in Hankou, including national banks, 38 legal private banks, and 21 private banks temporarily permitted to operate by the Ministry of Finance. The exchange volume of various banks and private banks at the National Bank of China used to be 60 billion per day, but it has now increased to about 300 billion. The daily interest rate for loans used to be 9 or 10 yuan, but after management, it has now fallen to 7 yuan. The daily interest rate for Class A current deposits used to be 4 yuan, but it has now fallen to 2 yuan or 1 yuan. The deposits of various banks and private banks in the National Bank of China this month are about three times that of last month, and the concentration of funds is a good phenomenon. The task ahead is to guide funds into normal channels. (Continued in column 1, page 2)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Indian Spiritual Leader Gandhi Assassinated; When the News Broke, Indians Wept Aloud; The Flames of War Are Likely to Spread Throughout India <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Indian spiritual leader Gandhi was shot three or four times in the chest by an assassin on his way to a prayer meeting at 5:00 PM Indian Standard Time on the 30th and died on the spot. The assassin was a young man who fired at Gandhi from a very close range. About 500 people were waiting for Gandhi to speak at the prayer meeting. Gandhi walked from his residence, the Birla House, to the wooden platform for speeches in the prayer meeting, supported by his two granddaughters. When the crowd saw Gandhi arrive, they stepped aside to make way. Suddenly, a young man, aged between 20 and 30, wearing a khaki uniform, drew a gun from his waist and fired four shots at Gandhi. Because the incident happened so suddenly, the crowd did not immediately understand what had happened. They only saw that Gandhi's white shirt was stained with blood from his neck to his abdomen. Some women fainted in shock, while others rushed to support Gandhi. Some of the braver women held Gandhi tightly until the police arrived.</p>
<p>When the news broke, the entire Delhi was shocked. Nehru and other cabinet members, as well as Indian Governor-General Mountbatten, immediately received the bad news by telephone. Shops in Delhi were smashed as soon as the news of the death was heard. A large number of troops and police were dispatched to maintain order in the city. People from all walks of life gathered in the streets, and some wept aloud. In front of the Birla House, the crowd was packed, and some shouted "Down with the Muslim murderers!" However, the authorities have not yet announced the identity of the assassin.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] After Gandhi's death, his body was even thinner than after his hunger strike. The assassin of Gandhi is believed to be an extremist of the Indian race, possibly belonging to a faction opposed to Gandhi's movement to promote peace between India and Muslims. With Gandhi's death, the flames of war may spread throughout India, and the two races of India and Muslims will inevitably kill each other.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 30th] According to eyewitnesses, the assassin of Gandhi mingled with people in the prayer meeting. He was short, wore a khaki uniform, and did not attract attention. The uniform may have been purchased from a store selling surplus US military supplies. He suddenly pulled out a pistol and quickly fired three shots, hitting Gandhi's vital organs. (All news about Gandhi's assassination is published on page 3.)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] General Sun Liren, Commander of the Army Training Command, flew from Taiwan to Shanghai at 3:50 PM yesterday. He will go to Nanjing in the next few days for instructions and return to his post a week later. According to Sun's aides, the current goal of military training in Taiwan is still to strengthen the coordination of various departments and improve the standard of the army. There are no plans for organizational changes. There are currently more than ten US military officers and soldiers in Taiwan, acting entirely as advisors to assist our country's training work. Regarding the speculation that the US advisory group plans to train new soldiers for us, there is no new information to report, and in fact, the US itself has not yet made a decision on this policy. Regarding the report by a foreign news agency that a Taiwanese guerrilla force attacked the National Army in Taichung, it is completely unfounded.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] After the news of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi reached this city, people in the capital expressed extreme shock. Dean Dai Chuanxian deeply mourned and wrote a eulogy: "Ancient country of ten thousand years, gave birth to a great sage, saving people and the world, sacrificing life. People's hearts do not return, heaven's will is uncertain, alas Mr.! Benevolence and righteousness are exhausted." After writing, he could not stop his tears. The original eulogy will be handed over to the Nanjing Central Daily for printing and publication. Dean Yu Youren was also extremely saddened by the news and wrote a short essay to express his condolences: "A most benevolent and compassionate Gandhi died tragically in broad daylight. I mourn for the humanity of the world. Tagore said: 'Gandhi is another name for sacrifice.' It is known that sacrifice is Gandhi's spirit, and the world has long recognized Gandhi as a saint of sacrifice. So, is Gandhi's assassination a success or a failure? I say: Gandhi's spirit can also be compared to the world, so that people in the world seeking freedom, independence, peace, and democracy will gain a kind of awakening, and the future of India will inevitably have many Gandhis rising up to act?" Zhang Daofan had accompanied Chairman Chiang on a visit to India and was very familiar with Gandhi. He expressed great shock and grief after hearing the news. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao said in response to an inquiry from this newspaper that he had also learned of the bad news from a broadcast in the Philippines. Our government is extremely shocked and saddened by this. Gandhi was the spiritual leader of all the people of India, representing the soul of India. Now, in the midst of national division and turmoil, this great change has occurred, and he has sacrificed his life for peace, which is truly regrettable. India is our country's fraternal nation, and Gandhi's spiritual model is admired by the world. Although the truth of the assassination is not yet known, in any case, we sincerely hope that our brothers in all of India, regardless of India and Muslims, will deeply understand the unfinished ambitions of the eternal Gandhi, and urgently hope for peace and stability. As soon as our Ministry of Foreign Affairs receives a confirmed report, it will send a telegram of condolences.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After learning of the sad news of Gandhi's assassination, Director of the Executive Yuan's News Bureau, Dong XianGuang, issued the following statement:</p>
<p>The Chinese government deeply felt shocked and grieved about this bad news. This spiritual leader of this generation had just said goodbye to us while the world needed his hard work. The loss of this leader is a great blow to the Indian people at the time when India's freedom struggle is about to be completed. Gandhi was the creator of India's freedom. If India did not have his wise leadership and selfless sacrifice, I am afraid that its political achievements would be far less than today. Gandhi himself was the symbol of the highest ideals of his nation. Gandhi died at the time when he led the people to make the final struggle for unity. His spirit of sacrificing for the country and the nation is a great example for mankind. All Chinese people mourned after hearing this sad news, because Gandhi was a great Asian, and his ideals were eternal lessons for all ages.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Regarding the issue of rationing daily necessities, according to news from the Ministry of Economic Affairs:</p>
<p>*   The method of rationing daily necessities to public school teachers and civil servants has changed slightly. Starting in February, each person will receive three dou of rice per month at no cost. In the past, eight dou were rationed at a fixed price. The rationing of coal, sugar, oil, salt, and cloth will continue to be carried out in accordance with past methods.</p>
<p>*   Grain from US aid supplies will be rationed at a fixed price starting on March 1. Rationing to all city residents and public school teachers and civil servants is also being considered.</p>
<p>*   The method of expanding the scope of rationing daily necessities beyond public school teachers and civil servants to the cultural sector, and even to city residents, was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and has been sent to the National Economic Commission for review. However, the commission, in view of the fact that the work will be extraordinarily complicated after the scope of rationing is expanded, and that it will be difficult to fully control the materials, has shelved the plan.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Legislative Yuan adjourned for a month in January and is now scheduled to reconvene on February 5. When the first general meeting of the Legislative Yuan this year is held, the issue of adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants will be discussed again. The adjustment method decided by the Executive Yuan this time is very different from the initial recommendations of the Legislative Yuan. Some legislators believe that they cannot remain silent and once gathered to nominate the original proposer, Liu Zhiping, to write to Executive Yuan Premier Zhang Qun, bitterly complaining about the inappropriateness of this method. When the Legislative Yuan meets on the 5th, it will also conduct detailed research based on the opinions of various committees. The main points of Liu's letter to Premier Zhang are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding salaries, the base salary of 30 yuan for civil and military officials is already quite low, but prices are galloping like wild horses, and the cost of living index has been stuck at the same number for three or four months. Is it possible for them not to worry about food, clothing, housing, and transportation? I believe that the salary paid by the government to public school teachers and civil servants should at least enable them to "maintain integrity." Otherwise, those officials with poor learning and ability will inevitably be corrupt if they get the opportunity.</p>
<p>The purchase of daily necessities should not be cancelled. I believe that if the government wants to equalize the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants in various places, it may gradually expand the rationing method to provinces and cities other than Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Regarding the wages of workers, the Executive Yuan's adjusted number this time actually assessed the original wages of technicians at a maximum of 40 yuan and a minimum of 20 yuan, and the wages of laborers at a maximum of 18 yuan and a minimum of 6 yuan. This is extremely unreasonable, because the higher wages of technicians are due to years of diligent service, which has increased each time it is tested. Now the government is erasing the achievements of their past work and reducing them all at once, which is unfair and should be quickly remedied.</p>
<p>Please consider carefully the downsizing of the organization. The trend of using people for private gain should be eliminated first, and those with concurrent positions should be laid off first. All those qualified to be civil servants should be registered, and if the government implements downsizing, it must have a thorough plan beforehand and must never add people while laying off people.</p>
<p>I know very well that an increase in the treatment of civil and military officials may mean an increase in the burden on the common people, but even if the government does not increase the burden on the common people, there are still ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The so-called increase in revenue is not an increase in taxes, but the most important thing is to requisition the domestic and foreign properties and deposits of large and small corrupt officials. The so-called reduction in expenditure, the most important thing is still to severely punish corruption and not let most of the people's hard-earned money flow into the private pockets of corrupt officials.</p>
<p>The Premier should think about the clean civil and military officials and improve their work efficiency. He should not let them live a life of starvation. I hope that the Premier can quickly come up with a way to change this situation and no longer make the civil and military officials across the country complain.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Jiyang, 30th dispatch] The Northeast Headquarters has decided to reduce its scope, taking on the responsibility of administrative and economic supervision and command.

<h3 id="e22">American Loans to China and the Opening of Inland Waterway Navigation Rights <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The plan for American loans to China is currently under discussion in Washington. Secretary of State Marshall and Mr. Bei Zuyi of the Chinese Technical Mission have met several times. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has also announced ten self-help reform plans, indicating that American loans are gradually becoming a reality. The Chinese government and people are naturally grateful for the goodwill of our American friends. However, the English-language "China Daily News" recently published an editorial entitled "How to Make American Loans Effective," proposing the opening of China's inland waterway navigation rights as a condition for American loans, which we cannot remain silent about.</p>
<p>The "China Daily News" editorial argues that China should first implement various internal reforms before the United States provides loans. Otherwise, past loans have been a waste, and future loans will still be a waste, and China's self-help ability will be further hindered. Our government should accept these suggestions. However, the newspaper's proposal to open inland waterway navigation rights, as stated in its original text, "China must abide by international practices regarding inland waterway transport. Currently, due to the interests of a few Chinese shipping merchants, abnormal restrictions are imposed on foreign ships, which not only weaken China's transport convenience but also increase transport costs," makes us feel as if we are not living in the modern era. Has the equal new treaty between China, the United States, and Britain become a worthless piece of paper?</p>
<p>The "China Daily News" is a newspaper run by Americans. Although its views may not represent the unanimous opinion of the American government and people, it clearly points out that it is the consensus of the American business community in China and a carefully considered conclusion. If so, we believe that the minds of the foreign "taipans" in Shanghai of the 19th century need to be changed.</p>
<p>China does need loans and foreign aid to carry out its work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. We will deeply thank anyone who sympathizes with us and helps us, and we are willing to work hard to be worthy of our friendly countries. However, we will never accept preconditions that interfere with our internal affairs or humiliate our country. Hasn't the US State Department repeatedly stated that American aid to Europe and China will not interfere in other countries' internal affairs or infringe upon their sovereignty? American businessmen in China are well aware of the Chinese situation. How can they not understand the US policy towards China? In recent years, they have mistakenly equated state-owned enterprises with bureaucracy and corruption, and have repeatedly advocated preventing the expansion of state-owned enterprises. They have also advocated restricting the power of trade associations and amending the provisions of the Factory Law. Aren't these interventions in our internal affairs? They openly advocate opening inland waterway navigation rights, isn't that infringing upon our country's sovereignty? As for their reasons for opening inland waterway navigation rights, they really do not "understand the Chinese situation" and are even distorting the truth and confusing public opinion.</p>
<p>We believe that opening inland waterway navigation rights infringes upon sovereignty, but they insist that it is an international practice. If it were an international practice, the Qing government would not have had to solemnly list the opening of inland waterway navigation rights in the treaty when signing unequal treaties, and we would not have had to write the abolition of inland waterway navigation rights into the treaty when we abolished unequal treaties later. Even if we take ten thousand steps back, even if the opening of inland waterway navigation rights is indeed an international practice, countries with infant industries also need to implement protection policies. Whether or not to adopt customary practices is our prerogative. All human beings are originally equal, but it is extremely unfair to force a child to fight an adult. In the past, Britain and Japan, with their superior financial resources, expanded their shipping businesses in China. With the weakness of Chinese shipping merchants, they could not withstand their attacks. Moreover, there was the so-called Yangtze Conference, which used its power to suppress smaller shipping merchants, preventing them from rising. At that time, Yangtze River shipping was almost entirely controlled by British and Japanese foreign firms. Therefore, during the period when unequal treaties existed, China's shipping industry could not develop. After the victory, when navigation rights were recovered, in just over two short years, the tonnage of Chinese ships jumped from the remaining 100,000 tons to over 900,000 tons, and it is still continuing to increase. This should be regarded by our friendly country, the United States, as the best example of China's self-help. If you really want to help China with construction, you should give China's shipping industry the opportunity to develop and designate part of the loan for the purchase and construction of ships to enhance China's transportation capacity. You shouldn't just be acting as a pawn for the British and making the opening of inland waterway navigation rights a prerequisite for the loan.</p>
<p>Now that the tonnage of Chinese ships has reached over 900,000 tons, it is safe to say that there is sufficient capacity for transportation along inland rivers and coastal waters, and even overseas transportation can be undertaken in part. The recent transportation of Japanese reparations materials and the transportation of Hainan Island minerals to Japan by the Chinese shipping industry is clear evidence of this. This is a contribution of the Chinese shipping industry to the country to obtain foreign exchange to meet urgent needs, and it should also be sympathized with by our friendly country, the United States. In the past, the reason why China's foreign trade was often in deficit was because of the high freight and insurance costs for exported goods, which consumed a significant amount of foreign exchange. If China could transport its own goods to foreign countries, and the goods sold to foreign countries were not F.O.B. Shanghai but C.I.F. New York or London, then international trade would not be too much in deficit. Some foreign businessmen blame the shrinkage of current exports solely on the lack of transportation tools. This is also a deliberate excuse and not the true reality. The shrinkage of exports need not be denied, but the biggest reason is still the technical issues of foreign exchange listing and export management, which is a well-known problem. Secondly, there is the obstruction of inland transportation. The inland areas have been disrupted by the Communist bandits, and transportation has been completely destroyed, so various exportable local products cannot be concentrated at the ports. Although the current ships have been requisitioned by the government for many missions, there is still more than enough to maintain commercial transport along the Yangtze River and the coast. Currently, there is not a shortage of ships for the goods, but a shortage of goods for the ships. We know that many British merchant ships sailing on inland rivers have already been transferred to Chinese merchants, and some have even nominally hung the Chinese flag. The United States originally did not have ships sailing on inland rivers, and there is no possibility of increasing transportation tools now. The "China Daily News" said that this "weakens China's transport convenience," but we don't know what they mean by that.</p>
<p>The increase in transportation costs is also a fact, but may we ask if other public utilities have increased? Even the public utilities run by British and American legal entities, such as electricity, telephone, tap water, gas, streetcars, and buses, have all increased monthly, and the extent of their increase is probably even greater than the increase in ship fares. Each time they increase their prices, they always use the high prices of oil, coal, materials, the cost of living index for employees, and the exchange rate as reasons. Doesn't the operation of ships have to be affected by these factors? According to our statistics, the increase in fares has not kept pace with the prices. Try comparing the fares at the end of 1946 with the fares at the end of 1947. How many times have they increased? Then compare the price index at the end of 1946 with the price index at the end of 1947. How many times have they increased? Then you will know that our judgment is not fabricated out of thin air. It is hard to believe that if foreign ships sailed on inland rivers, the fares would drop, because foreign ships would also be affected by the prices of oil, coal, materials, the cost of living index for employees, and the exchange rate. Even if we compare the current freight costs between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the freight charges of British merchant ships are not only no lower than those of Chinese merchants, but are much higher. According to our investigation, the freight charges for Chinese merchants shipping goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong are only 1.2 million yuan per ton, while British merchants require HK$112, and also require Hong Kong drafts. Otherwise, even if calculated at the black market rate, it would be about three times higher than that of Chinese merchants. Therefore, the "China Daily News"'s statement that it "increases transport costs" is not credible at all. If foreign merchants, in order to suppress Chinese merchants, continue to use the old tricks of the former "Yangtze Conference" to achieve the goal of dominating China's shipping industry, this is a "trust" tactic. How can our China, which follows the Three Principles of the People, allow this? The "China Daily News" opposes monopolies. Why does it particularly favor the return of British shipping merchants and not see this? If it is for the sake of the United States itself, then the former Russell &amp; Company is a precedent. There is no need to compete with British shipping merchants.</p>
<p>In short, China certainly needs loans, but it needs international sympathy even more. China certainly needs foreign aid, but it needs to maintain its own sovereignty even more. Otherwise, if diplomacy goes astray and sovereignty is once again lost, it will arouse the people's indignation. We hope our government will pay attention!</p>
<h3 id="e23">Lin Chongyong Talks to Reporters About the Crackdown on Illegal Financial Institutions in Hankou <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Regarding the handling of illegal financial institutions, Lin said: These illegal financial institutions were all established after the victory, due to the laissez-faire attitude of the managers and the government's failure to fully implement laws and regulations at that time. These financial institutions have considerable financial resources and specialize in speculative trading, driving up prices, which greatly harms people's livelihoods. According to the total capital in Hankou, it is only 400 billion, and more than half of it is in the hands of illegal financial institutions. They also openly have an exchange in the Money Industry Association, with a daily exchange volume of over 200 billion. Legal and licensed financial institutions have another exchange in Zhengtai Financial Institution, with an exchange volume of only 100 billion. The legal commercial banks only have an exchange volume of 60 billion per day in the exchange of the National Bank. After the establishment of this bureau, the first thing it did was to merge the two exchanges into the exchange of the National Bank to unify authority and facilitate management. The execution of this plan initially aroused resentment, but now it has gradually subsided. The good influence of this move is obvious. Prices have gradually stabilized as a result. For example, white rice, which originally sold for 1.05 million per dan, has now fallen to 920,000. Currently, more than half of the closed financial institutions have applied for liquidation procedures. The deadline for application has been set for February 9. General Cheng Qian, director of the Wuhan Headquarters, is also very concerned about the handling of these follow-up matters. In addition to cracking down on the activities of illegal financial institutions, the work of the Gold Management Bureau also includes cracking down on the illegal business of legal financial institutions.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Chongqing Tobacco Industry Representatives Arrive in Nanjing to Petition for Tax Reduction <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 30th dispatch] Chongqing cigarette manufacturers, due to the excessive tax increase by the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, have sent representatives Zhou Wuquan and Zhang Keqiang to Nanjing to petition. They held a reception for reporters on the evening of the 30th to explain the purpose of the petition, saying that the first tax increase of the 37th year by the Taxation Administration was particularly heavy in the Chongqing area, with an average tax increase of 300%. Other areas and foreign companies only increased by 100%. The government provides British and American tobacco companies with raw materials such as cigarette paper and tin foil at official prices in four installments per year, and also provides preferential measures such as "official fixed market price foreign exchange," "low-interest loans," and "tax account credit." The factories in Chongqing lack the above-mentioned preferential treatment. Now the factories in Chongqing are facing the biggest crisis. They hope that the government can quickly improve the tax system, reduce the tax rate, and provide fair treatment so as to maintain their survival and avoid the serious social problem of unemployment for more than 100,000 people. They visited Director Jiang Shuge of the Taxation Administration on the 30th and explained everything. Jiang expressed great sympathy, but said that the tax rate was determined by legislative procedures and could be requested to the relevant parties when the tax is increased next month. They will continue to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance on the 31st.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th dispatch] The Qingdao Industry Petition Delegation, consisting of Yin Zhizhong, Nian Mingting, and four others, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th. They will request the Executive Yuan's Economic Affairs, Social Affairs, and Finance Departments, as well as the National Resources Commission, to supply fuel, increase the foreign exchange limit, and open production loans. The delegation held a reception for the press at 4 PM today. Delegation leader Yin Zhizhong reported on the current difficulties of Qingdao's industry, stating: "There are currently a total of 1,266 factories in Qingdao, which is half of the peak period in the past. Less than 40% of the existing factories are operating, and some of them are still half-operating or intermittent. On the eve of the Lunar New Year, the industrial sector is really unable to continue to maintain the difficult situation. Therefore, we have come to Nanjing to appeal and request: 1. To approve a 50% reduction in all taxes. 2. To request the Fuel Management Committee to allocate 20,000 tons of coal per month for industrial use. 3. To request the opening of north-south wheat transportation. 4. To request the opening of production loans and the issuance of 150 billion yuan of emergency loans to Qingdao City before the Lunar New Year. 5. To increase the foreign exchange limit to 2 million US dollars."</p>

There were 38 important cases sent for legal action. He emphasized that the cases handled were carefully handled.

<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 30th dispatch] The remains of two of our military officers who infiltrated Siam in 1944 under the instructions of the British military authorities stationed in Kandy (in Ceylon) and those responsible for economic warfare and were killed have been transported from southern Siam to this place in order to be transported back to the motherland for burial. These two heroes are Major Guo Riren (32 years old, Cambridge University graduate) and Captain Ma Kewu (30 years old, Army University graduate). They were ordered by our government to assist the British military in Kandy in planning the offensive against Siam and Malaya. They flew to the sea near Phang-nga (in southern Siam) at dawn one day in 1944 with two soldiers, weapons, and a radio in a seaplane, and then landed in a rubber boat. However, in a hurry, they forgot to bring drinking water, so they entered a village in search of water under the pressure of thirst and were discovered. The local police and soldiers did not know their identities, so they surrounded their camp in the night and soon shot the two heroes to death one after another. Their bodies were buried on the beach, and the other two soldiers were arrested and imprisoned. They took the opportunity to return to the country after the war.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Implementation Details for the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Approval of Cotton Purchase and Yarn Distribution <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee drafted six implementation details to achieve the goals of unified purchase and unified sales through contracted spinning and contracted weaving. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now approved two items: cotton purchase and yarn distribution. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Implementation Details for Cotton Purchase: These details are formulated in accordance with Articles 2 and 8 of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations. This Committee will establish agencies in major cotton collecting and distributing markets and cotton-consuming areas throughout the country to purchase cotton. When necessary, it may designate areas and entrust other institutions and cotton yarn millers' trade associations to handle purchasing matters on its behalf. The purchase price of cotton will be determined by this Committee based on the cost of cotton production, quality, transportation, and other factors in various regions. A fair price for standard grade cotton will be determined as the standard for pricing various types of cotton, and adjustments may be made at any time based on local production, transportation, and market conditions. The moisture content of cotton shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Preventing Adulteration of Cotton, promulgated on March 23, 1936, with 11% as the legal standard and 12% as the final limit. The quality content shall be in accordance with the provisions of the same regulations, with 0.5% as the legal standard and 2% as the maximum limit. The grades of cotton are determined based on the color, amount of impurities, and quality of ginning, and are divided into six grades: 1. Superior grade, 2. Second superior grade, 3. Medium grade, 4. Second medium grade, 5. Inferior grade, 6. Second inferior grade. The above grades are based on the medium grade as the standard. The fiber length of cotton is determined by the average staple length of each batch of cotton and is divided into seven grades, as follows (unit: inches): 1. 1 1/16 inches (including 1 1/16 and above), 2. 1 inch (including 1 inch to 1 1/32), 3. 15/16 inches (including 15/16 to 31/32), 4. 7/8 inches (including 7/8 to 29/32), 5. 13/16 inches (including 13/16 to 27/32), 6. 3/4 inches (including 3/4 to 25/32), 7. 11/16 inches (including 11/16 and below). The above fiber grades are based on 7/8 as the standard. All firms and merchants engaged in the cotton trading business shall sell the cotton they purchase to this Committee's cotton purchasing agency or other entrusted agencies and entrusted yarn millers' trade associations at the prices determined locally, and shall not hoard or sell privately. The transportation and re-export of cotton shall be subject to the transportation certificate issued by this Committee, and the areas of implementation will be announced at any time. All yarn millers in cotton-producing areas that have not been designated for contracted spinning may apply for registration and, after approval, purchase cotton locally with the purchasing certificate issued by this Committee at the price stipulated by this Committee, limited to the amount used for three months of storage. All factories located in non-cotton-producing areas that have not been designated for contracted spinning may apply for registration and, after approval, this Committee will allocate and sell cotton at the stipulated price at any time, or issue a purchasing certificate and designate an area for self-purchase according to the price and quantity stipulated by this Committee. These details may be amended at any time with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs if there are any incomplete matters. These regulations shall be implemented after being submitted to and approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>(B) Implementation Details for Yarn Distribution: These details are formulated in accordance with Articles 2, 4, and 8 of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations. The distribution of cotton yarn is targeted at cotton yarn reprocessing factories or their trade associations and yarn merchants that have been registered and qualified by this Committee. Before the registration and investigation of the cotton yarn distribution accounts in the preceding paragraph have been completed, the cotton yarn reprocessing industry will temporarily take the trade association's distribution accounts as the target, and the yarn merchants will temporarily take the distribution accounts that have been registered and qualified by the China Textile Construction Company as the target. If the Textile Construction Company has not registered yarn merchants locally, the business names reported by the trade association will be temporarily used as the target. The distribution of cotton cloth is targeted at cloth merchants and dyeing factories that have been registered and qualified by this Committee. Before the registration and investigation of the cotton cloth distribution accounts in the preceding paragraph have been completed, the distribution accounts that have been registered and qualified by the Textile Construction Company will be temporarily used as the target. If the Textile Construction Company has not registered cotton cloth distribution accounts locally, the manufacturers reported by the trade association will be temporarily used as the target. The registration of yarn and cloth distribution accounts shall meet the following conditions: A. Having joined the local trade association, obtained a membership certificate, and registered with the competent authority and obtained a certificate. B. Having paid taxes or declared to the tax authorities and obtained a certificate. C. Production factories with factory buildings, equipment, and production tools that are in operation. D. Yarn and cloth merchant companies with business premises and business equipment that are in operation. The application form in the preceding paragraph shall be stamped and certified by the trade association, and then submitted to this Committee for review. After investigation, a registration certificate will be issued. Small-scale or handicraft weaving households, legal groups, and cotton yarn reprocessing factories and cloth merchants in various places where this Committee has not set up distribution agencies may register with this Committee in the name of the local trade association or legal group, stating the production equipment, yarn count, capital amount, and turnover, and a registration certificate will be issued after approval. The amount of yarn to be distributed to cotton yarn reprocessing factories or other trade associations shall be determined by this Committee based on their production equipment and yarn requirements. The amount of cloth to be distributed to dyeing factories shall be determined by this Committee based on their production equipment and cloth requirements. The amount of yarn and cloth to be distributed to yarn merchants and cloth merchants shall be determined by this Committee based on the yarn and cloth supply and demand situation. Yarn and cloth distribution shall be based on the method of quotation and sales. When distributing yarn and cloth, each yarn and cloth distribution account shall report its willingness to pay and the quantity it is willing to purchase, and apply for distribution. Then, this Committee or the local office shall determine a reasonable price and quantity with reference to the reported price and market conditions. Cotton yarn reprocessing factories have priority in purchasing yarn. When necessary, this Committee may entrust reputable yarn and cloth merchants with retail stores in major cities to sell yarn and cloth on its behalf, and the relationship between the rights and responsibilities of the two parties shall be stipulated in the entrustment contract. If the cotton yarn purchased by cotton yarn reprocessing factories or their trade associations and yarn merchants, or the cloth purchased by cloth merchants and dyeing factories, is not paid for or picked up within the specified time after approval, the distribution may be suspended for a certain period or the registration may be revoked, depending on the circumstances. The cotton yarn distributed to cotton yarn reprocessing factories and the grey cloth distributed to dyeing and weaving factories shall only be used for their own weaving and dyeing and shall not be resold. Otherwise, they will be severely punished or their registration will be revoked. If any manufacturers or trade associations involved in distribution hoard, speculate, raise prices, falsely report, engage in speculative purchases, or engage in other fraudulent activities, their registration will be revoked, and the responsible persons will be severely punished according to law. The distribution agency shall make a separate registration of each account on a daily basis for reference. These details may be amended with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs if there are any incomplete matters. These regulations shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcasting: Washington News, Truman deeply regrets Gandhi's assassination, believing that Gandhi's death is a tragic loss to the whole world.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcasting: Prime Minister Attlee will deliver a broadcast speech tonight, begging India and Pakistan to resolve their differences. After Gandhi's assassination, riots have broken out in Bombay, and the situation is chaotic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] The news of Gandhi's assassination shocked the entire British government and people. The British government will immediately issue a statement expressing its condolences and sympathy to the Indian people. The British government will also issue a similar statement through the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. The Indian High Commission in London immediately lowered its flag to half-mast, and the High Commissioner refused to see guests. Generally speaking, there is a fear that Gandhi was the keystone of India, and that once he is gone, it will be more difficult to restrain the rioters. Cables from Lake Success and Washington all show the shock of the people there. United Nations officials unanimously condemned the atrocity and expressed hope that it would not hinder peace in India.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 30th] Indian representative to the United Nations, Aiyangar, declared today that Gandhi's assassination was "the greatest tragedy in our country's history. I deeply hope that our country can survive this major blow. There are still many leaders who will definitely be able to turn the country from danger to safety."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 30th] After hearing the news of Gandhi's assassination, Philippine President Roxas said, "My heart is filled with sorrow. A great man in the world has now died." British Minister to the Philippines, Folger, also said, "This is truly abhorrent."</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Two hours after Gandhi's assassination, Prime Minister Nehru, with a heavy heart, announced to the crowd gathered outside his residence that India would enter a period of national mourning starting at midnight on the 30th. When Gandhi's assassination occurred, Indians ran to tell each other, and the news quickly spread throughout the country. For a time, the sound of "The Father of the Nation has been assassinated, quickly spread the news" was heard everywhere. All India Radio also announced the news of Gandhi's assassination to all of India, and the bulletin said: "We must announce with extreme sadness that Gandhi passed away a moment ago. Gandhi was shot three to four times on the way to prayer at 5:00 PM this afternoon. The bullets hit his chest, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 30th] After Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated tonight, the government here immediately convened an emergency meeting, chaired by Premier Nehru. The local police hurriedly implemented security measures to prevent new riots between different religious groups. The old district of Chandni Chowk, which has always been a hotbed of unrest, is now under strict patrol by mounted police.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Karachi, 30th] Government circles and Muslim people received the news of Gandhi's assassination with great resentment. Gandhi was regarded by them as the only surviving person who could use his great spirit to move the people of India and Pakistan and enable the two countries to achieve understanding and friendship. Therefore, all political circles feel that the unexpected death of this old man is a sign of danger for the future.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Gandhi's Life: Struggling for Peace and Freedom Three Imprisonments and Four Fasts <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869. He studied at Rajkot, Bhavnagar, London, and other places. In 1889, he obtained a lawyer's license and practiced law in South Africa for as long as seventeen years. He successively led the passive resistance movement of Indian immigrants in South Africa, and finally reached a solution agreement with General Smuts in 1914. He returned to India in 1915, and in 1918 he began his non-cooperation movement. In 1930, he launched the movement to abolish the salt law. He was detained by the British authorities on May 5 of that year and was released on January 26 of the following year. In 1931, he repeatedly negotiated with the Governor-General of India and finally concluded the Delhi Treaty. In the same year, he attended the Second Round Table Conference as a representative. In 1932, he was imprisoned again, and he fasted for a week in prison. Later, he fasted for three weeks to demand improved treatment for the untouchable class before he was released from prison. After his release from prison, he launched a civil disobedience patrol movement. In 1933, he was imprisoned again. After his release from prison, he announced another fast, asking the public to support the movement to oppose the untouchable system. In 1934, he withdrew from the active leadership of the Congress Party and instructed the Congress Party to accept government positions under the new reform guidance system. He himself continued to guide the policies of the Congress Party in the village of Sevagram, the headquarters of his rural construction work. Later, he led the movement to fight for freedom of speech, writing, and action, until 1942 when he announced the cessation of this movement. Gandhi's ideal was for the British to withdraw from India, which became a reality on August 15, 1947. On January 12 of this year, he fasted again to call for peace between India and Pakistan, and ended the fast five days later. Afterwards, he expressed his hope to live to 130 years old so that he could continue to serve the people of India. A week ago, when Gandhi was addressing a prayer meeting, a homemade bomb exploded twenty yards away from him, but he was not injured and continued to speak as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Impasse in India-Pakistan Problem Indian Representatives Insist on Ceasing Fire First Lake Success, Ranjan Hoff's Suggestion Fails to be Implemented</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 29th] As India continues to insist that stopping the Kashmir war is a prerequisite for holding a plebiscite, the Security Council seems to agree to both simultaneously in order to resolve the India-Pakistan dispute. The President of the Council, Ranjan Hoff, proposed two motions at the opening of the meeting today: one called for a plebiscite, and the other called for efforts to stop the war. Both tasks are to be undertaken by a three-person mediation committee that has not yet been established. China, the United States, Britain, France, and Canada all strongly support Ranjan Hoff's proposal, but the Council failed to take action today due to a lengthy speech of opposition by the Indian representative.</p>
<p>[Also Dispatch] Our representative Jiang Tingfu told the Central News Agency reporter today that the Chinese delegation hopes that the Security Council's handling of the India-Pakistan dispute will be resolved and that an on-site investigation can be conducted as soon as possible. Jiang, our permanent representative to the United Nations, returned to the United Nations headquarters today after leaving here for two months.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th] The French National Assembly approved Premier Schuman's proposal this morning to recall the large 5,000 franc notes.

Faced with the threat of the cabinet's resignation, the deputies voted to pass the proposal. Some observers believe that if the French cabinet collapses, it will accelerate the decisive struggle between the Communists and the de Gaulle faction for power. The Parliament's Finance Committee had previously rejected the government's proposal, but the National Assembly overturned the Finance Committee's rejection by a vote of 320 to 288.

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 29th] The United Nations Mission to Korea is currently awaiting developments in the Korean situation. It is reported that some members of the mission are awaiting instructions from their respective governments before formally responding to the Soviet Union's rejection. The mission, citing the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate, is scheduled to hold a plenary session within days to discuss the future course of action for the mission. Some members believe that since the United Nations has not authorized the mission to hold a general election solely in southern Korea, the matter should be submitted to the United Nations Committee for deliberation, and they believe that the United Nations Committee should formulate quantitative measures based on the mission's recommendations. At the same time, the mission's Second Subcommittee continues to solicit opinions from Korean leaders.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 30th] According to qualified Korean and American observers here, unless the United Nations Mission to Korea can establish a unified Korean government, or reach an agreement before the Soviets withdraw their troops, the resolution of the Korean issue will inevitably lead to bloodshed and tragedy.

<p>Soviet Union Protests US Naval Vessels Stationed in US Ports</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The US State Department today presented a memorandum to the Soviet Union, rejecting the Soviet protest against the US Air Force reopening the Manarah Air Base in North Africa.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] President Truman stated today at a press conference that it is absolutely necessary for Congress not to make substantial cuts in the amount of aid for the Marshall Plan. He said that reports that a congressional committee plans to reduce the initial 15-month aid budget of $6.8 billion by a substantial $2.3 billion would turn the recovery plan into a mere relief program. He added that if the United States cannot implement the recovery plan, it would be better not to take any action at all. He declared with the utmost seriousness: "The welfare of the United States and the welfare of the whole world are closely tied to this one thing. I cannot describe it in more emphatic terms. World peace depends on the recovery and independence of Europe. In other words, it depends on the success of the Marshall Plan. I believe that spending $17 billion to buy peace is not too high a price." The President also expressed hope that Congress would pass the entire four-year and one-quarter aid program for Europe and that it should not vote on each year's plan individually.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] TASS reports that the Soviet Union has formally protested, arguing that the presence of the US Navy in Italian seaports violates the Italian Peace Treaty. TASS stated that the above protest was lodged on the 28th by Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, with US Secretary of State Marshall, less than 24 hours after the Soviet Union protested against the Anglo-American decision to re-establish air bases in Libya.

<p>— Translated by the Newspaper Translation Department</p>
<p>The First Stroke Wrote Good News on My Heart</p>
<p>The life of someone involved in politics is made up of a series of contradictions. I have deeply tasted the flavors, but nothing has been longer, more successful, or more important than the struggle to win trade agreements. When I first gave a speech in Congress calling for lower tariffs and fewer trade restrictions, I was thirty-six years old; when we finally achieved victory in 1934, I was already sixty-two. The temporary victory of lowering tariffs when the Underwood Act was passed in 1913 was greatly affected by the outbreak of the World War, and as soon as the Republican Party took power in 1921, they immediately tore it to pieces.</p>
<p>When I returned from Montevideo, I discovered two things: on the one hand, the President approved of the trade agreement plan and expressed his support; but on the extreme opposite side, he appointed George Peek, during my absence, to chair a committee to adjust foreign trade relations. Peek, who had served as Director of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, distrusted the measures of lowering tariffs and advocated establishing a prohibition of commerce around the country to implement the policies of the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. If his theory were implemented, it would mean the demise of the trade agreement policy. This appointment occurred one week after the establishment of the Commercial Policy Executive Committee.</p>
<p>I immediately joined the Commercial Policy Executive Committee and began working on drafting the Trade Agreements Act. I found that there was a unanimous opinion in the committee that Congress should authorize the President to establish reciprocal trade agreements. Everyone believed that only this kind of government-implemented agreement could succeed. If the treaty contained a large number of most-favored-nation tariff provisions and had to be submitted to the Senate for approval, there would be no hope of success.</p>
<p>I believe that in my country's foreign policy, the economic aspect is on one side, and the political aspect is on the other, but the two are closely related. It seems impossible to me to develop friendly relations with other countries in the political sphere without abandoning the provocation of other countries' hostility in the economic sphere. How can we cooperate with them to promote peace when we are fighting them economically? When I entered the State Department, I found thirty-four formal and strong diplomatic protests in the State Department's archives, which were filed by no less than thirty-four countries after the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Act. Their protests were not limited to words. They considered prohibiting their exports from entering the United States to be tantamount to prohibiting trade. In anger, they retaliated with international actions.</p>
<p>When I returned from Montevideo, I went straight to the point, preparing to submit the trade agreement plan to Congress and pass it. By the end of February 1934, we had completed the Trade Agreements Act. Ironically, our opponent Peek actually provided us with considerable practical assistance. The original draft was too long and too complicated. Peek suggested, "Shorten the bill to two or three pages, and the chances will be better." We followed his advice, and he was right.</p>
<p>On March 20, the bill passed the House by a vote of 274 to 111; on June 4, it passed the Senate by a vote of 57 to 33. In both the House and the Senate, the strong opposition to the Smoot-Hawley Act was helpful to us.</p>
<p>At 9:15 PM on June 12, I personally witnessed the President signing the bill into law in the White House. Each stroke of the President seemed to write good news on my heart. The long struggle I had waged for many years to establish a reciprocal trade policy and reduce tariff wars had finally achieved final victory.</p>
<p>What is the Trade Agreements Act? Based on my experience in Congress and the State Department, I feel that the public is more likely to grasp and is more interested in the many broad political actions of our government in foreign affairs than the difficult-to-understand economic actions. It is not too difficult to understand a diplomatic protest, a political treaty, the recall of an ambassador, or the recognition of a new government. However, it is indeed difficult to understand the interrelationship between foreign commerce, tariffs, currency exchange, and debts.</p>
<p>The Trade Agreements Act itself is simple and fundamentally includes three key points: trade agreements can be negotiated without first submitting them to Congress; tariffs can be reduced by up to half, provided that our country obtains equivalent concessions from other countries. The tariff reduction measures apply equally to all countries that do not discriminate against us.</p>
<p>The first two points need no explanation. The third point is a subject that has caused considerable controversy. This is the so-called unconditional most-favored-nation clause. This wording is not the most appropriate. It gives the impression of obtaining or granting preferential or special treatment. In fact, it only means: "I will not treat you worse than I treat the best, as long as you do not treat me worse than you treat the best."</p>
<p>As for reducing tariffs, the meaning is very simple: when we reduce the tariff rate on certain goods imported from Country A, we also reduce the tariff rate on the same goods imported from Countries B-Z, as long as Countries B-Z give us the same low rates and the same amount of freedom for our exports as they give to any other country (the so-called Countries B-Z refer to countries other than Country A—Translator). If Country B imposes higher taxes or more restrictions on our products than on products imported from any other country, then Country B must also pay the high tax rates stipulated by the Smoot-Hawley Act on our exports—which is the pinnacle of learning in American history.</p>
<p>In practice, we have always implemented the most-favored-nation principle in a conditional form until 1923. This means that when we sign a tariff treaty with Country A, our tariff reduction measures do not apply to Countries B-Z unless Countries B-Z agree to give us the same concessions that Country A gives us. Secretary of State Hughes during the Harding administration began to implement this principle in an unconditional form.</p>
<p>The conditional form of the most-favored-nation principle has proven to be a failure. Why? The trade between any two countries and the trade between one of those countries and another country are never the same in terms of products or quantity. If we reduce certain tariffs on Country A in exchange for Country A reducing certain tariffs on us, it is difficult to explain what is being exchanged for Country A's reduction of a certain tariff rate on us. Therefore, we cannot go to Country B and say: "We are willing to give you the same low tariff rates that we give to Country A, as long as you can agree to give us the same low tariff rates that Country A gives us." Country B may not be interested in the goods stipulated in the agreement we have with Country A. This system also creates endless negotiations with many countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Trade Agreements Act will declare that an unconditional policy must be implemented. But some people argue that this is equivalent to giving people some rights without any corresponding gains. They would say, "You have reduced the tariff rate on horses, seeds, and whiskey imported from Country A, and you have obtained from Country A a reduction in the tariff rate on our exported cars, wheat, and lard. That's great! Then you go to Countries B-Z and give them the low tariff rates we gave to Country A—but you don't get anything in exchange! That's not okay!"</p>
<p>But the fact is that we can strike many exchanges. Countries B-Z can get the same low tariff rates that we give to Country A if they do not discriminate against us. Country B has always or only applied the lowest tariff rate to Countries Y and Z, but if Country B wants to enjoy our low tariff rates, it must give us the same tariff rates that it gives to Countries Y and Z. Therefore, the use of the name unconditional most-favored-nation is quite likely to cause misunderstanding. Other countries obtain our low tariff rates, not without conditions, but on the condition that they give us equal treatment.</p>
<p>In fact, this principle has earned American exporters hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>In the first two years after the establishment of the trade agreement, our exports were estimated to be worth as much as $265 million due to the equal treatment and non-discrimination guarantees we obtained from other countries.</p>
<p>Others would argue that extending the tariff reduction measures, in addition to the country with which we have already signed a trade agreement, to other countries would inevitably lead to a large influx of imports. They say, "Reducing the tariff rate on shoes imported from Country A may be appropriate, but if Countries NB-A also ship shoes to our country at the same tariff rate, shoes will flood our market."</p>
<p>The answer is that Countries B-Z do not all manufacture shoes for export. Perhaps only one or two countries export shoes, and possibly less than Country A.</p>
<p>If Country A is our main competitor in a certain commodity, and we can allow Country A to reduce tariffs without harming our own producers, then our producers are unlikely to be harmed by the competition of imports from Country B or Country C. Because in terms of supply, they are ultimately secondary.</p>
<p>In fact, countries that export to our country are always the main exporters of a certain commodity or certain commodities. Due to climate, traditional technology, or the location of raw material production, they are better suited to produce these items for us, better and cheaper than other countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, when negotiating trade agreements, we pay special attention to reducing the tariffs on these types of products, while ignoring other products, because these products are not our main exporters to us. In this way, we can obtain the greatest tariff steps from Country A for our own exports, while our imports from Country A are concentrated on the items in which it has the most inventory. As for the products that we neglect from Country A, they can be obtained through negotiations with other countries, with everything focusing on the main exporting country. This approach is called the "finding the main supplier" approach.</p>
<p>Since 1916, I have always believed that economic warfare breeds political warfare, and non-discriminatory trade can reduce the possibility of war. The Trade Agreements Act was passed in 1934, but the following year, war broke out in Africa, three years later in Asia, and five years later in Europe. Therefore, some people may say, "Look, trade agreements cannot prevent war."</p>
<p>Of course, I have never claimed that trade agreements are a panacea for preventing war. Moreover, at the time the trade agreement was passed, Hitler had been in power for a year and a half and was frantically carrying out armaments; Mussolini had been in power for almost twelve years and was planning the Abyssinian War; Japan had entered Manchuria for almost three years and was preparing to withdraw from the naval limitation treaty. The free commerce promoted in the trade agreement was of no use to these countries because they had already adapted their commerce to the needs of war.</p>
<p>If something like the Trade Agreements Act could have been passed in 1922, instead of the Fordney-McCumber Act, as I urged in several speeches I gave during World War I, the situation might have been different.</p>
<p>When I was a child on a farm in Tennessee, we had two neighbors—let me call them Jenkins and Jones—who were hostile to each other. For many years, they had harbored ill feelings towards each other—I don't know why. When they met on the road, in town, or in church, they always glared at each other coldly and never spoke.</p>
<p>Later, one spring, when Jenkins needed mules to cultivate the land the most, one of his donkeys kicked up its heels. At the same time, Jones lacked corn to feed his pigs. As luck would have it, Jones had finished cultivating and had a mule idle, while Jenkins had a barn of corn. A friendly third party brought the two men together, and Jones let Jenkins use his mule in exchange for corn for feeding the pigs.</p>
<p>As a result, these two enemies, who had harbored old grudges, soon became the best of friends. A common transaction and a normal neighborly relationship made them realize each other's economic needs and finally reconciled.</p>
<p>Yes, the war still came even though the trade agreement was signed. But it is a fact that the war did not break out between the United States and any country with which we could negotiate a trade agreement. With very few exceptions, it is also a fact that all the countries that signed trade agreements with us were united with us against the Axis. Political ties are based on economic ties.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Order for Dissolution Allowed to Be Postponed, Tongji University Ordered to Resume Classes in Full; Vice Minister Hang Issues Written Statement; Severely Criticizes Illegal Actions and Orders Separate Disciplinary Actions <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The incident in which a small number of unruly elements from the Tongji University student unrest surrounded and beat Mayor Wu the other day has shocked both China and foreign countries, and the central authorities were particularly angered upon hearing the news. Executive Yuan Chief Zhang Qun and Education Minister Zhu Jiahua specially dispatched Education Vice Minister Hang Liwu, along with Secondary Education Director Wu Zhaotang, carrying the order to dissolve Tongji University, to Shanghai yesterday morning to handle the school's strike. President Ding Wenyuan personally went to the North Railway Station yesterday morning to welcome Hang, reported in detail the situation of the students surrounding and beating Mayor Wu the previous day, and the municipal authorities' assistance in handling the aftermath, and requested that Hang temporarily postpone the announcement of the dissolution order, saying that he would persuade the students to resume classes immediately. After President Ding left, Hang began to investigate the details of the incident. At 4 PM, he convened a meeting of university presidents at the International Hotel, attended by Ding Wenyuan of Tongji, Zhang Yi of Fudan, Cheng Xiaogang of Jiaotong, Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua, Ou Yuanhuai of Daxia, Hu Dunfu of Datong, and Hu Wenyao of   and Ling Xianyuan of Shanghai. Hang inquired about the situation of each school separately and gave instructions on rectifying academic ethics. After the meeting, the entire group went to Mayor Wu's residence to express their condolences to the mayor. He then received reporters and issued a written statement as follows: "The current turmoil caused by some students of Tongji University not complying with the law has been dragging on for more than ten days. The school authorities and faculty members have been able to maintain a strict and appropriate approach, which the Ministry greatly relies on and has repeatedly dispatched personnel to Shanghai to assist. Until yesterday (the 29th), a small number of unruly elements incited the crowd, overstepped the bounds, and even insulted the mayor. This kind of illegal behavior is not allowed in any country. The central authorities attach great importance to it. In order to safeguard education and rectify academic ethics, the Ministry has decided to take strict measures and thoroughly rectify the situation. I came to Shanghai this morning, already carrying the order to dissolve Tongji University. However, according to President Ding of the school, the students have shown considerable remorse, and he requested a temporary postponement of the dissolution order. Therefore, President Ding has announced to the striking students that they must all resume classes immediately, otherwise they will comply with the dissolution order. Regarding the instigators from other schools, the security organs have provisionally allowed each school authority to bail them out, to be summoned and present at any time. In order to rectify academic ethics, the Ministry has ordered each school authority to investigate the circumstances and take separate disciplinary actions. As for the students who were arrested for assaulting people and other criminals, in addition to the responsible organs of the city severely punishing them according to law, the school will still wait for the investigation to be completed before taking further action. Furthermore, according to the results of the inspection among the students yesterday, in the Tongji strike incident, not only were there non-Tongji students involved, but some were not students at all. It is now clear that the school turmoil today is a planned策动 by villains. The endurance and sense of responsibility of Mayor Wu and others in yesterday's unfortunate incident are admirable. Today, I have represented Executive Yuan Chief Zhang and Minister Zhu to express my condolences." Hang also stated that tomorrow (the 31st), Tongji classes will take attendance by name, and if it is found that anyone is absent from class without a reason, the school will severely punish them. Hang plans to stay in Shanghai for several more days until the student unrest is completely quelled.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Five Medical Students at Tongji Suddenly Announce Strike Yesterday; Students in Other Two Colleges Mostly Return to Normal <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Tongji University students partially resumed classes yesterday, but five students in the medical school, instigated by unruly elements, suddenly announced a strike again. The school was still trying to persuade them until late at night. More than ninety Jiaotong University students who stayed in the Qimei Road Engineering College of the school the previous night were finally claimed by the person in charge of the school and left yesterday afternoon. Most of the students of the college were not in the college, and the students who stayed in the college mostly gathered in the dormitory to talk about the conflict with the police the previous day, with a leisurely attitude. Some students were still running around on the field, ignoring reporters' interviews. Propaganda documents all over the walls have been torn down, and the classrooms inside and outside have not yet been cleaned. The huge campus presents a desolate scene. There were only two classes of students in the classrooms upstairs, refusing reporters to take pictures. Dozens of resident doctors in the college stayed in the college for food and accommodation yesterday, chatting with students from time to time, looking quite close. The gate of the college was guarded by doctors, and students entered and exited with certificates. At the Faculty of Law at the end of Sichuan Road, most of the students had gone to class, but they were in twos and threes, and their spirits were very scattered. Dean Xu Daolin personally took attendance in each class to count the number of students attending class and sent it to President Ding for review in the evening. However, the five students in the medical school, who had never been on strike, declared a strike for the first time yesterday, claiming to show support for the students who had suffered, due to the instigation of unruly elements. Despite the professors of the college trying to persuade them in many ways, they were still at an impasse until late at night.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Hoping Parents Restrain Their Children to Focus on Seeking Knowledge and Loving the Country: Various Organizations Publish a Letter to Students' Parents <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, 25 organizations in the city, including the City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the China Industry Association, the National Federation of Commerce, the National Seamen's Union, the Banking Association, the City Federation of Trade Unions, the Journalists' Association, the City Education Association, the City Farmers' Association, and the Lawyers' Association, issued a letter to parents of students in secondary schools and above in the city regarding the Tongji University student unrest incident. The original text briefly stated: "We believe that since students have been sent to school to study, the school authorities should naturally bear the responsibility of discipline and education. However, the supervision of parents at home should not be neglected. Especially when school facilities are not yet perfect and school guidance is not yet comprehensive, parents should pay special attention to the cultivation of their children's character and the advancement of their studies, and should never completely let them go. We believe that your parents will agree with this point. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, student unrest has occurred continuously in universities across the country, involving strikes, marches, and even large groups of people going to Nanjing to petition. Even if we do not talk about the destruction of social order and tranquility, the loss to the studies of these students is truly incalculable. If we continue to act in such a confused and reckless manner, how can the country entrust these students, who are being used and acting recklessly, with important national tasks? How can we hope that they will recognize their own responsibility to the times? The country is currently facing many troubles, and the suppression of chaos and the building of the nation require talent urgently. We feel that young students are the backbone of the next generation of the country. In order to cherish their future and save the national crisis, we once again appeal to your parents with twelve-thousandth sincerity, hoping that each of you, in your capacity as parents and with the feelings of fathers and brothers, will immediately restrain your children. Focus on seeking knowledge when attending school, and base youthful actions on loving the country. Young people in a democratic era should abide by the law and be models for the public. In particular, they must not fall into the traps of conspirators, be exploited by others, or willingly be puppets, leading to personal ruin and disgrace, and being abandoned by the public. This is not only the glory of fathers and brothers, but also the great fortune of the country and the nation."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Director of Education Bureau Issues Statement <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Li Xike, the Director of the Education Bureau of this city, issued a statement yesterday regarding the student unrest, saying: "Since last summer, students in various schools in this city have been making trouble under various pretexts, stirring up unrest, and taking increasingly extreme actions. Even a few secondary school students have participated in it. Recently, students from the two schools have even assaulted and insulted local administrative leaders. If this trend is not rectified, education will inevitably go bankrupt. Not only will I fail to live up to the heavy trust of the team leader, but I will also have no way to face the country and the nation. Young students are inherently pure, but they are led astray by a small number of people with ulterior motives, acting impulsively and losing their reason, which is truly regrettable. Principals and teachers, bearing the responsibility of education, should patiently guide and skillfully lead students to bring their actions back on track. Students from public and private schools in this city who participated in yesterday's overstepping actions have been ordered to return to their respective schools and should be punished according to the severity of their circumstances as a warning to others. From now on, I hope that the principals and teachers of all schools will share the difficulties of the times, restrain students, and maintain academic integrity. This is what I earnestly hope for."</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The conflict between students of Tongji University and the police on Qimei Road the day before yesterday suddenly turned the Kanglong Wine Shop, where distinguished guests gathered, into a lucrative business. Its daily revenue reached more than 6 million yuan, exceeding its usual daily revenue by five times. The elderly couple, Qu Caiyun, were all smiles as they received the frequent patronage of officials from the municipal government and leaders from all walks of life, considering it a rare and grand occasion. Yesterday, the municipal government sent staff member Zhang Naimin to deliver cigarettes and food expenses, totaling 762,000 yuan, and awarded an additional 200,000 yuan as a reward. This included 38 bowls of shredded pork noodles, 5 bowls of plain noodles, 2 jin of peanuts, and 4 packs of Marlboro cigarettes. After receiving the money, the elderly couple repeatedly expressed their gratitude. Afterwards, they also requested the municipal government to assist in installing electric lights, and the staff member agreed to help them find a way with the Public Works Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Ironclad Evidence of a Conspiracy to Assault the Mayor at Four O'Clock: Dozens of Arrested Students Are Currently Being Interrogated <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the police局, the number of students arrested in this incident totaled dozens. Currently, because it is still under investigation, the names have not been announced yet. However, according to reporters, many of them are imposters of student representatives, and one or two of them were found with propaganda documents of the 共匪 and credentials as liaison officers during this riot. Gong Shao羆, a student from Tongji, was found with an iron box, which contained a slip of paper that read "Strike the Mayor at Four O'Clock," which coincided with the time when the Mayor was assaulted the day before. This shows that this riot was a planned conspiracy. In addition, those arrested included eleven students who had already been expelled from the school, but most of them were lawless elements who disrupted order, obstructed official duties, and assaulted the Mayor. They will be transferred to the court and the garrison headquarters for interrogation in accordance with the law, depending on the severity of the circumstances after the investigation is completed. Education Minister Zhu钧鉴, The environment in Shanghai has always been extremely complicated. Since Mayor Wu took charge of Shanghai's administration, he has always maintained a peaceful and impartial attitude, as well as a spirit of perseverance and struggle, exhausting his efforts and responding to difficulties, so the community has been stable and public opinion has been unified for more than a year. In the past,奸匪 repeatedly launched labor unrest and student unrest in Shanghai, attempting to disrupt the order of the entire city, but all failed under Mayor Wu's careful prevention and control. However, yesterday, a student unrest occurred at Tongji University in this city. Mayor Wu was invited to mediate, but he was assaulted and insulted by the students, which caused the entire city to feel pain and shocked both China and foreign countries. After investigating the Tongji students, it is reasonable that they did not comply with the regulations and formed a department representative assembly, and the principal did not recognize it. The students disregarded the overall situation, besieged the principal, and threatened to strike. It is also reasonable for the principal to expel the main perpetrators in order to maintain school discipline. However, the students forgot their duty to study, made a lot of noise, demanded to collectively petition in Nanjing, and even opposed the government, and their ulterior motives are obvious. After the student crowds gathered, Mayor Wu persuaded them bitterly from morning to night, and even gave up eating, but the students, after making noise and ignoring them, finally took violent actions and assaulted and insulted the Mayor. The various circles in this city, in addition to expressing their deep condolences to the Mayor for suffering such adversity and their deep respect for his spirit of faithfully performing his duties and serving the country with sincerity, and witnessing the youth nurtured by the country, at the time when the country is beginning to implement constitutionalism, in this international cultural center, a few dregs have staged this strange drama of blatant lawlessness, barbarism, and riot, which makes people feel pain for the future of our education and worry for the future of our nation. The various organizations in this city, representing the citizens of the city, deeply believe that education is the lifeline of the country, and academic integrity is the prerequisite for education. Today, the corruption of academic integrity has reached an unbearable level. Noise and strikes have become commonplace, and offending superiors and assaulting teachers have also become a common practice. The spread of the decadent trend will lead to the demise of teachers' ethics and the bankruptcy of education. I respectfully request that the competent officials be ordered to forcefully reverse the tide and strictly rectify it, so that young students can move towards the right track and the foundation of the nation can be laid here. As for the violent actions of the Tongji students this time, it is obviously a separate conspiracy, attempting to disrupt the country, and the ambitious elements who impersonate students and spread chaos, as well as the destructive elements who have been found to have奸匪 evidence, are even more unforgivable, and I pray that you will order a thorough investigation and severely punish them to maintain discipline and the foundation of the country.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu, considering that the city will implement a comprehensive rice rationing and voucher purchase system starting in March, and in order to enrich the stock and channel grain sources, previously instructed the Public Works Bureau to entrust the Dredging Bureau with the task of dredging the Suzhou River, so as to avoid temporary congestion of rice boats. Since the start of construction, the Dredging Bureau has regularly dispatched one dredger, one tugboat, and four mud barges to carry out construction in the river. Currently, the project has progressed from the mouth of the river to the section from Sichuan Road Bridge to Henan Road Bridge. In order to meet the actual needs, the bureau has intensified the dredging of the important river section from the mouth of the river to Maigen Road Bridge. If there is any urgent need in other sections, ships will be temporarily transferred to carry out dredging to facilitate grain transportation.</p>

<p>[Another News] Whether the dance industry survives or not will come to a final turning point today. The notice that the Social Bureau will draw lots to eliminate dance halls at 3:00 PM this afternoon was officially delivered to the Dance Hall Industry Association yesterday. Dance industry workers and dancers are trying to make a final struggle. Today, major newspapers will publish their large advertisements calling for help. At 1:00 PM this afternoon, they will hold the third emergency meeting at the New Xianlin to discuss countermeasures. According to the person in charge of the association yesterday: The dance industry believes that the central government's ban on dancing violates the spirit of the constitution, so they have hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file an administrative lawsuit with the government, and request that the Social Bureau temporarily suspend the execution of the order to draw lots and eliminate dance halls before a solution is reached. Also, the Dance Industry Association pointed out that the City Council had previously resolved to oppose the ban on dancing at the last meeting and telegraphed the central government to reconsider the case, so yesterday they specially sent representatives Zhuang Hongwei of Xianlesi, Wang Jingwen of Paramount, Tang Zongjie, chairman of the Trade Union, Mao Zhihai Hu Yunyuan, executive directors, and Sun Zhimin and Jin Meihong, dancer representatives, to the City Council to request opposition to the Social Bureau's sudden drawing of lots. Secretary-General Xiang received them and expressed his sympathy. The representatives continued to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to protect the rights of members and vigorously support them, and the result was said to be very satisfactory. Therefore, whether the lottery elimination can be realized as scheduled today is still difficult to predict.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu was surrounded and insulted while dissuading Tongji University students from petitioning in Nanjing the day before yesterday (the 29th). He rested at his official residence yesterday and did not go to the municipal government to work. He consulted a doctor yesterday, and the doctor advised him to lie down and rest for one or two days. Currently, the mayor has swelling in his temples and cheeks, and feels pain in his head, brain, and waist. Chairman Chiang was greatly angered upon hearing the news and immediately sent a telegram of condolence. Madam Chiang also telephoned Mayor Wu personally at 6:00 PM yesterday to express her condolences. Mayor Wu's wife answered the phone, reported the details of the mayor's injuries, and conveyed her greetings. In addition, leaders and representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai went to the municipal government and the official residence to express their condolences in an endless stream. It is believed that such an outrageous action was instigated behind the scenes by conspirators, and they unanimously demanded that discipline be rectified and academic integrity be revived.</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang's original telegram of condolence is as follows: "Urgent. Shanghai Mayor Wu. Confidential. I am very surprised to hear that you were injured in Tongji. I am very concerned about your injury. Please reply! Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten note. Zishifu seal" According to Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of Education who rushed to Nanjing from Nanjing, "The Chairman was extremely angry after hearing about the illegal actions of the students and insisted on severely punishing the perpetrators." Also, after Mayor Wu 　 returned to his official residence from Tongji at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, he reported the handling process to President Zhang by long 　 telephone at 3:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Condolences from All Circles <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, around 11:00 AM, many people went to the Municipal Government to express their condolences, including Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Xu Jiyu, Du Yuesheng, Ge Jechen, Wu Yun Chu, Li Renzai, Shui Xiangyun, Ding, Feng Youzhen, Zhou Maicheng, Wan Lin, Tang Chengzong, Chu Shun, Ma Shao, Xi Yushu, Jiang Pingfan, Tian Shujun, Yu Wen, Fan Shouyuan, Wang Ziyang, Wang Gongkuan, Yang Shoubei, Bu Xian, Yang Fusheng, Li Yunliang, Zhang Zhongyuan and over fifty others. In addition, Ma Guoying, a student from Wei Yu Elementary School, presented a small flower basket. Hang Liwu, the Vice Minister of Education, also attended. The Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian represented the city in receiving them at the auditorium.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Speaker Pan Delivers Two Speeches: The School Authorities Should Bear Responsibility <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Speaker Pan stood up and delivered sincere words of condolence twice, roughly stating: Mayor Wu being beaten by students of Tongji University has caused Shanghai citizens to feel deeply sorry and indignant. However, when the students' actions exceeded normal boundaries, Mayor Wu still strictly instructed the police "not to open fire." Despite being injured, he did not fall into the conspiracy of the communists. Until late at night, he earnestly advised the students to resume classes. His great spirit of caring for students is truly worthy of our respect. The few students who committed the violence should be severely punished according to the law. The rest of the good students, I believe, will be inspired by the Mayor's spirit and realize their mistakes. Speaker Pan also stated that the principal should bear full responsibility for this incident. Tongji students have been on strike for two or three weeks. Mayor Wu went to persuade the students not to petition in Nanjing, from morning until late at night, but the principal was not at the school all day and only arrived around 6:00 PM after the Mayor was insulted. We should demand that the government punish such irresponsible school authorities. Furthermore, Commander Xuan asked the principals of various schools to take their students back late last night, and entrusted Chen Baotai to go. At that time, the Mayor was talking with Tongji professors and student representatives, advising the students to send ten representatives and form a small group for easy consultation. Unexpectedly, some students still did not understand, and continued to incite violence, shouting and rushing forward. Stones and wooden sticks flew everywhere. The Mayor's hat was knocked off, and the right side of his head was hit four or five times with a wooden stick. The Mayor was pushed to the ground, and the students punched and kicked him. Yet, the Mayor still tried to stand up and prevent the police from taking action. The police were moved to tears by the situation. Although the Mayor was humiliated, he said in an extremely gentle manner: "Insult is one thing, mediation is another." He never ceased to mediate and persuade. And he instructed the representatives: "Hand over the students who insulted the Mayor. The expelled students must leave the school. Resume classes immediately tomorrow." Finally, Commander Xuan believed that the students' actions of beating and insulting the Mayor had already gone too far, and that students from various schools were mixed together. He ordered a search of the students' ID cards. The students were taken back by the principals of their respective schools and placed under observation at the school. The Mayor considered the insult a small matter and the resumption of classes a major one, and continued to earnestly persuade the students. Most of the students were inspired by the Mayor's spirit and expressed remorse, promising to resume classes today. However, the principals of several schools could not be found. If it is said that this was a free off-campus activity for the students and the schools cannot interfere, how can this be the way to run national education? If such a phenomenon exists in national education, what can we expect for the future? Last time, Jiaotong University students beat Deputy Bureau Chief Li. The incident has been brewing for some time, it is not something new. In order to get to the root of the problem, all circles in Shanghai should ask the government to rectify the discipline. If education is not strict, it is the teachers' laziness. If the academic atmosphere is not good, the principals and teachers should all bear the responsibility. Moreover, the Tongji student unrest has gone beyond normal boundaries and should have been disbanded long ago. However, the Mayor was magnanimous and only demanded that classes be resumed. Except for those who beat and insulted the Mayor on the spot, who will be dealt with according to the law, the rest will not be pursued. Therefore, if Tongji students still do not resume classes today, the government should be asked to disband the school immediately and demand that the Ministry of Education investigate and replace all irresponsible principals of national universities.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Chairman Fang Recounts What He Witnessed <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Fang described in detail what he had witnessed, saying: After learning that Mayor Wu had personally gone to Tongji, I immediately accompanied Deputy Chairman Cao Zun. It is estimated that from 11:00 AM to 3:00 AM, the Mayor spared no effort to maintain order and ensure stability in Shanghai, even at the expense of going without food. This is truly worthy of the respect of all citizens of the city.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Secretary-General Shen Expresses Gratitude on Behalf of the Mayor <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Shen expressed gratitude on behalf of Mayor Wu, roughly stating: The turmoil at Tongji University has been brewing for two or three weeks. A few days ago, the Mayor learned that the students were planning to go to Nanjing to petition, which could affect the city's security. He was very anxious and sent people to persuade them, saying that there was no need to go to Nanjing. The student representatives came to see him and asked the Mayor to personally explain the situation. The Mayor went to the school yesterday, but he did not expect the students to behave in this way. He was injured, hoarse, and exhausted. He is still unable to get out of bed today. Hearing that representatives from all circles have come to express their condolences, the Mayor is very grateful and specifically instructed me to express his gratitude to everyone.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Xu Jiyu and Others Request the Maintenance of Discipline <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Xu Jiyu said: Student unrest may be unavoidable from time to time, but it has never been heard of that students would beat and insult the Mayor. Such actions are not like students acting like students, and schools not acting like schools. They are practically approaching riotous mobs. Such schools should not exist. Today, we should not only ask about the Mayor's condition but should also further express concrete opinions. To maintain Shanghai's security, the existence of riotous mobs cannot be tolerated. Wang Xiaoyu said: The form of student unrest is becoming increasingly intense, which is chilling. I have just returned from Nanjing and immediately instructed my children not to blindly follow. Mayor Wu has extraordinary talent and should deal with extraordinary changes and endure extraordinary humiliation. However, the government's discipline should be maintained, and the students' parents should also be responsible. Li Yunliang said: Mayor Wu's insult this time was not the students' insult, but the communists' insult through their hands, a direct insult to the Mayor, and an indirect insult to all Shanghai citizens. Jiaotong University and Tongji University used to have a very good academic atmosphere, but now they are being instigated by the communists, who are using the students' names to cause trouble. Shanghai citizens should express their righteous views.</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Ministry Is Determined to Rectify the Academic Atmosphere <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Vice Minister Hang Liwu said: This unfortunate incident is not only heartbreaking but also embarrassing. I am here with a disbandment order. Because Mayor Wu, despite being insulted, still gave the students until 2:00 PM on the 30th to resume classes, otherwise he would disband the school. As for the students from other schools who participated, they will be dealt with separately. I fully accept Speaker Pan's various opinions. The Ministry is determined to rectify the academic atmosphere of various schools. I am very willing to learn from everyone's valuable opinions.</p>
<p>Finally, Li Renzai, Wang Xianqing, and student representatives spoke one after another and expressed their condolences. The meeting adjourned at 12:40 PM.</p>

Zhang Juncai succeeded Su in his original position. However, Su still lived in the Eastern Economic Research Institute. Zhang asked him to transfer the bed to him, but Su refused. A quarrel broke out between the two sides. Zhang took out a pistol to threaten Su. The gun was taken away by onlookers. When Su saw that Zhang had no gun, he chased and beat him. Zhang fled to the window and was punched in the chest by Su, causing Zhang to fall out of the window. He died from serious injuries. The police station sent him to the court for trial.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The North Sichuan Road Police Branch received a tip-off a few days ago, saying that bandits were hiding in its jurisdiction. Branch Chief He ordered Section Chief Wu Zhenlong to supervise his staff, including Wang, to patrol Ouyang Road and Sida Road to arrest them. They arrested two bandits in a nearby wooden shed on the spot. According to their confessions, their names are Zhang Douzhao and Yang Jinlong. A pistol, four bullets, and a magazine were found in Yang's pocket. They were taken to the police station for interrogation. They confessed to armed robbery and admitted to gathering bandits in Ningbo and committing multiple robberies. In November last year, they robbed the Zhang family in Qingshui Lake, Zhuang City, Ningbo, of hundreds of thousands of yuan and came to Shanghai. Soon after, they met their friend Zhang Ketian, who introduced them to the fugitive Zhi Fang.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Hangzhou on the 29th] Zhejiang is the most developed province in China's fishing industry. Among the nine coastal provinces, it is unmatched except for Guangdong and Shandong. The fishing grounds, covering more than 40,000 square nautical miles between 27 degrees 10 minutes and 30 degrees 40 minutes north latitude, have intricate and deep harbors and a series of islands, including Nanbeiyu outside the Feiyun River and Ao River estuaries, Yuhuan Islands outside the Ou River estuary, Taizhou Islands outside the Jiaojiang and Jinqing port estuaries, Nantian and Yushan outside Sanmen Bay, Hanshan outside Juehan, and the Zhoushan Islands outside Xiangshan Port, Yong River estuary, and Hangzhou Bay. The vastness and quality of the Zhoushan fishing grounds make it the center of China's East China Sea fishing industry. The better seaports include Changzhi Port in Zhoushan, Shipu in Sanmen Bay, and Wenzhou in the Ou River estuary as the three major centers.</p>
<p>According to accurate statistics from the Zhejiang Construction Department, the province currently has</p>
<p>11,797 fishing boats of all sizes, 100,000 sea fishing households, 72,352 fishermen directly engaged in fishing, and 3 million people indirectly dependent on fishing for a living. The main catches are four types: large and small yellow croaker, ribbonfish, and cuttlefish (squid). Other catches, such as pomfret, eel, shark, croaker, flounder, jellyfish, and laver, are also abundant. The total catch in 1946 was 2,726,340 dan. The winter fishing season in 1947 was also abundant. The spring fishing season (from February to June in the lunar calendar) accounts for about one-third of the annual catch, and the winter fishing season (from September in the lunar calendar to January of the following year) accounts for two-thirds of the catch, so the total annual catch may exceed last year's.</p>
<p>Zhejiang's large yellow croaker is produced in the Juyu Port and Huang Dayang areas. From the vernal equinox to Lesser Fullness every year, from southeast to northwest, boats using large pu nets, small double nets, and drift nets</p>
<p>fish with the tides</p>
<p>. The output value is about 500 billion yuan (calculated at 10,000 yuan per catty, the same below). Half of them are collected by the fishing factories in Daishan and Juyu Mountain to make dried fish, which are transported fresh or salted to Ningbo, and then sold to the east and west of Zhejiang, and transported to Shanghai to sell to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Most of the small yellow croaker is concentrated in Shenjiamen, Zhoushan Islands. From late winter to early spring, large nets are used to catch them in Sheshan Yang, Taohua, Liuheng, Langgang, etc. The annual output value is about 800 billion yuan, and the sales are the same as large yellow croaker. The ribbonfish fishing grounds are in Dinghai, Changtu, and other places. From the beginning of September to the middle of November in the lunar calendar, large double boats and Fujian hook boats are used for fishing. The annual output value is about 300 billion yuan, and the sales are as above. The output value of cuttlefish is about 100 billion yuan. From February to June in the lunar calendar, trawls, cuttlefish cages, and illuminated boats and cuttlefish rafts are used in the Taizhou Islands and Zhoushan Islands for fishing, and they are sold to Jiangxi, Fujian, and various parts of Southeast Asia. The annual output of other fishes, such as pomfret, is also in the hundreds of billions of yuan. In Zhejiang's economic resources, offshore fisheries do occupy an important part.</p>
<p>Fishermen's lives,</p>
<p>apart from being more dangerous, are more prosperous than those of salt workers and farmers. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were affected by the Japanese blockade at sea, and fishing was blocked in many ways, causing harm to their livelihoods. Moreover, many fishing boats were lost, numbering 3,544. Since the victory, the Relief Administration has, at the request of various fishing groups, allocated a large amount of shipbuilding timber, and the provincial government plans to set up shipyards in Ningbo and other places to build wooden boats for relief. However, due to transportation, funding, and jurisdictional issues, progress is slower than that of a snail. The government's so-called relief: fishing loans, is also very pitiful. During the winter fishing season last year, the Agricultural Bank of China lent a total of only 1 billion yuan in Zhejiang, namely 300 million in the Wenzhou area, 200 million in the Taizhou area, and 500 million in the Ningbo area. Later, there were a few that were carried out independently by local banks. Not only are the procedures complicated, but they can only borrow 10 to 20 million, which is far from enough, so the fishermen have to rely on usurious loans. A large boat's seasonal fishing trip costs about 100 million (not including the cost of adding fishing gear). Like this</p>
<p>winter fish season</p>
<p>with abundant production, each boat can get 100 to 200 dan to 500 to 600 dan, and the market price per dan is 1 million yuan, which can make several times the profit, so they are very willing to borrow capital at high interest rates. However, during this fishing season, two hurricanes sank more than 30 fishing boats, and swept all the lives and wealth into the ocean. This is the greatest misfortune for fishermen. Anyone who has read the French novel "An Iceland Fisherman" can easily imagine the tragic emotions of these unfortunate fishermen.</p>
<p>Since the restoration, the government has indeed made considerable efforts in alleviating the suffering of fishermen. The establishment of fish markets is a major construction. Originally, the</p>
<p>greatest exploitation</p>
<p>of fishermen was the fishing industry, which lent capital to fishermen and forced them to buy catches at low prices, thereby making huge profits. Now, the government has established fish markets, although they are still jointly run by officials and merchants. This level of exploitation has at least been reduced a lot. What the fishermen are most eager for from the government at present is maritime security. Due to the insufficient strength of the coastal security forces themselves, the vast area, and the fleeing and lurking of pirates, it is not easy to capture them. The navy and the offshore police have failed to cooperate thoroughly. Security is always a difficult problem to solve. Fishermen have no choice but to be "ticketed" by the pirates when going out to fish, using money to accept the pirates' "protection." There is also the phenomenon of "smuggling with the connivance of anti-smuggling" occurring in the coastal areas. Therefore, how to ensure maritime security in order to protect the lifeline of the people's livelihoods and economy in the coastal areas of Zhejiang is the greatest hope of the fishermen and also a major responsibility of the government.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Qingpu on the 29th] Li Keming, the leader of the 2nd Group of the "People's Liberation Army Qing Song Brigade," was arrested by the county authorities in Zhujie Xinqiao on November 6th last year. At the beginning of this year, the Songhu Garrison Command also arrested and sent a bandit leader named Li Keming to the county for filing, forming a double case. After interrogation by the military law office, it was learned that the latter was indeed a bandit leader, and the former was a hooligan from Zhushu, with the same name. A few days ago, Wu, the wife of the fake bandit leader Li Keming, was arrested for being involved with bandits. She specifically submitted a request to the county government for bail for her husband. The county government, according to the report, stated that although Li Keming of Zhujie was not a bandit leader, he usually relied on his power to bully and oppress the local area, and was a hooligan and traitor who could not be easily forgiven. Therefore, he will continue to be detained.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Guangzhou on the 29th] According to reports from Lechang County: The rich bituminous coal mines in Lechang County, according to surveys, if they can be mined in large quantities, can meet the needs of the whole country for ten years.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Jiangyin on the 29th] Yangku in Dongxiang was originally a fortress city, built during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty to defend against Japanese pirates. It was demolished at the beginning of the Republic of China. The town's population and commerce are the crown of Dongxiang. County Magistrate Xu Wangshu designated it as an autonomous demonstration town and appointed Xia Yizhi as the town mayor. Xia is a woman, 46 years old, graduated from Southeast University, and served as a member of the Design and Assessment Committee of the Hunan Provincial Government. She has been serving as the town mayor for more than a year and has devoted herself to grassroots work in the local area. The county government has high expectations for her. She has put the most effort into searching for and arresting drug addicts and strictly prohibiting gambling. In order to set up a rural hospital, she rented the old site of the former Jixing pawnshop. When digging a well, she found a large number of hidden gold and silver ornaments. Because Mo Tingfu, a former pawnshop shareholder, has physical problems, he insisted on returning all of them, which has not yet been resolved.</p>

<p>Disaster Victims Freeze to Death; Boat Crew Drowns</p>
<p>[Our Haizhou Correspondent, 24th] From the 22nd onward, Haizhou experienced heavy snowfall for two consecutive days. On the morning of the 24th, the weather finally cleared, with snow accumulating to a depth of one and a half to one and two-thirds feet on level ground, an unprecedented snowfall in decades. Automobiles were unable to run, and prices of goods soared. Among the refugees from Xinpu and the impoverished, numbering over ten thousand, many were dying from cold and hunger each day. Off the coast of Lianyungang, a sailboat was capsized by strong winds on the 23rd, drowning six crew members and passengers. Another report: In Guanyun, deaths from cold and starvation among the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are reported daily.

<h3 id="e103">Flour Prices Rise in Bengbu, Creating a Black Market, Affecting the People's Food Supply; Representatives from Various Industries Petition <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 28th] With the cold weather and approaching end of the year, there is extreme panic regarding food supplies in northern Anhui, presenting an unsettling situation. The number of refugees in the market town is no less than one hundred thousand, suffering from both hunger and cold, a truly unbearable sight. The Xinfeng flour mills have repeatedly increased flour prices, gradually creating a black market that affects the people's food supply, arousing public indignation. Although the municipal government has strictly suppressed prices, they continue to outwardly comply but inwardly resist, showing no concern for the poor. The directors and supervisors of over forty industry guilds in the city once gathered to discuss countermeasures, appointing Ding Fowu, Xia Xiangzhai, Mu Daomei, and four others as representatives to petition in Nanjing, preparing to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Ministry of Food for the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate and severely punish them. According to statements made by Fowu and others, Bengbu is located near the north, and most residents consume wheat-based foods. Northern Anhui is traditionally a wheat-producing area, and the transportation of coal from Huainan is also more convenient than elsewhere. Since the raw material prices for flour production are lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai, the price of flour should also be lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, the Shixing and Xinfeng factories have been blinded by profit, disregarding the livelihood of the people, and during this period of suppression of rebellion, they single-mindedly manipulated prices, raising the price of each bag of flour from 420,000 to 645,000 yuan within half a month, and frequently halting sales to deliberately create a black market, not only hindering the people's food supply but also promoting social unrest. They have decided to go to Nanjing on the 28th to petition and request the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate, and they will not stop until their goals are achieved. It is learned that the municipal authorities have intervened to mediate and will strictly suppress flour prices to maintain the people's food supply, but it remains to be seen whether the Shixing and Xinfeng factories will comply.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 29th] Staff reductions in Jiangsu Province's provincial-level agencies are inevitable as they have received orders from the central government. Yesterday, this reporter specifically inquired with a personnel official from the provincial government, who stated that the province's provincial-level agencies are complying with central government orders, stipulating a monthly reduction of 5 percent, requiring a 25 percent reduction within five months. The province originally intended to consider the actual situation of each agency and make a one-time reduction, but due to various difficulties, it has been decided to adopt a gradual monthly reduction method. Based on the current number of personnel in each agency, approximately 800 to 900 people will need to be reduced. The methods for compensating those laid off and issuing severance pay are currently being carefully considered by each agency and will be decided after being submitted to Chairman Wang for approval. It is also learned that there is talk of downsizing the provincial government, with plans to reduce it to four departments (Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction) and three offices (Secretariat, Land and Grain, and Accounting). According to informed sources, although the Ministry of Interior Affairs has drafted a "Provincial Government Reform Plan" for the adjustment of provincial-level agencies, it was not promulgated due to the imminent constitutional government. Regarding the adjustment of provincial-level agencies, the Ministry of Interior Affairs has no other instructions, so it is unlikely to be realized before the establishment of the constitutional government.</p>

As the winter vacation begins, it is inevitable that many young students will be forced to drop out of school due to rising prices and the impact of tuition fees for the next semester. In view of this, the Association has once again requested that various middle schools in the city continue to provide free places for students, hold the second free student admission examination, and expand the scope in order to fully implement the Association's original intention of assisting students. All underprivileged students in the city who wish to enter the first or second grade of junior or senior high school can register from the 1st to the 3rd of next month at the Bile Middle School at 80 Yandang Road, or the Shanghai Primary and Secondary School Staff Consumer Cooperative at 60 Zhibu Road, or the Huashi Middle School at 330 Tanggu Road. The examination dates are set for February 6 for junior high school and February 7-8 for senior high school and will be held at Bile Middle School at 80 Yandang Road.</p>

<p>[Dahua News Agency] The Municipal Education Bureau announced that the city's national schools have not reached the standard of one school per district, and there are still not enough places for all school-age children who wish to enroll. Therefore, the 1947 work plan will continue to focus on increasing the number of national schools and classes, admitting as many school-age children as possible, and encouraging private individuals to establish schools. After a year of effort, the increase in national schools has been limited by funding, and the expected goals could not be achieved. However, the increase in private elementary schools has been considerable.

The percentage of school-age children attending school has reached over 86% (the number of schoolchildren in the city has increased by more than 20% this year, so while there are more children enrolled, the percentage of school dropouts has been limited). In addition, the percentage of national education funding in the city's municipal funding has increased nearly doubled compared to before the war, while the number of students in municipal elementary schools has increased more than 165% compared to before the war (there were 62,151 students in municipal elementary schools in the spring of 1947).

<h3 id="e121">Teachers College Relocation to Beijing and Upgrade to University Movement; Students in the Deep Mountains of Nanyue Make Appeals Again <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanyue Correspondent] The National Teachers College of Nanyue in Hunan Province has repeatedly appealed to the authorities for the "Relocation to Beijing and Upgrade to University Movement." Recently, a declaration to strike in wait for orders was issued. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Now we express our hopes and desires with grief and prayer.</p>
<p>We know that striking is a painful measure. However, due to the compulsion of circumstances, we have no choice but to resort to this last resort. We remember that when a strike was brewing last year, the Ministry of Education gave us a considerable response, but a year has passed, and hope has once again become a bubble. Therefore, today, we vow to again fight for the minimum living conditions of this college with heavy sacrifices.</p>
<p>In the current stage of "Education First in the Period of National Construction," sacred and great responsibilities have fallen on our shoulders. This group of normal school students are not only receiving this professional training to engage in the practical work of education, but also bears the important mission of studying education academics. We deeply feel the difficulty of future responsibilities and the hardship of the current environment, and we cannot but appeal, request, and protest. The strike is an expression of the entire action!</p>
<p>The National Teachers College, which grew out of its own blood and tears during the Anti-Japanese War, although traveling and displaced along the road, has indeed taken on a sacred responsibility in education. This excellent and nationally-oriented higher normal education institution should have moved to the capital and expanded its scale after the victory. However, due to the prejudices of one or two people in charge, it was placed in the deep mountains of Nanyue, suffocating our breath, restricting our development, and depriving us of the responsibilities we bear and the rights we deserve. Nanyue is just a Buddhist jungle and a scenic spot, not a place where higher education institutions can develop. In the past year or more, we have not only endured many material hardships, but also the original professors have left one after another, and the newly hired professors have been unable to move forward. In addition, diseases have spread, giving us great spiritual blows. Who is to blame? It is the fault of the mountain! We want this college to have an ideal future, and the only way to do that is to leave Nanyue and move to Nanjing as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Since higher normal education is a kind of professional training and bears the important mission of cultivating teachers for secondary schools and educational administrators and studying educational academics, it should be given corresponding cultivation and reasonable development. This college has undergone nine years of hard work, and all aspects have shown excellent results. The facts are there, and there is no need to repeat them. If China wants to have brilliant achievements in education in the future, it is necessary to establish several large-scale normal universities. Concerned about the future of national education and mindful of the important mission of this college, we hope to immediately upgrade to a university!</p>
<p>We are unwilling to say that the government has any prejudice against education! We are unwilling to say what percentage of the national budget is allocated to education! However, all the faculty and students of this college are already in an extremely difficult situation. We are ragged and hungry, but we bear heavy responsibilities. We have hope, we have confidence, but this college cannot get to actively engage in construction. This is all because of insufficient funding! In the midst of soaring prices, what is the use of 100,000 yuan per month for non-staple food and 3,000 yuan per year for lamp oil! What is the use of 100,000 yuan per term for pocket money and 400,000 yuan per year for uniforms! This is all the Ministry of Education's "generous kindness" to us that is "beneficial but not costly"! Education is inherently a poor career, but it should not be frozen and starved. Education needs stability and should not be without development. Confining us in the secluded valley of Nanyue without giving us the minimum living conditions, is this the national education plan? This time, President Pi went to Beijing, carrying only our basic demands, but the negotiations were fruitless. We should protest against the authorities' neglect of education!</p>
<p>Since Nanyue is not a space for us to survive, and there are higher normal colleges in neighboring Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces that can develop border education, it is not necessary for this college, which is national in nature, to stay in Nanyue for a long time. More than a year of mountain life has given us too much pain and made us sacrifice greatly. Today, it has reached an intolerable time. We have started a strike on January 14th and will wait for orders and will not stop until we get a reasonable response! In order to fight for the necessary conditions for survival, we do not hesitate to pay this heavy price, but we only consider striking to be a painful measure!"</p>

<h3 id="e122">King of Tennis Goes Pro: The Brilliant Record of Kramm's Life <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Special Article from This Newspaper] Former US Davis Cup main player and amateur tennis champion Jack Kramm went pro last October, and has since been touring the United States with the contemporary professional tennis leader Riggs, fighting head to head. To date, in a total of twenty-one encounters, Kramm has won twelve times, temporarily taking the lead.</p>
<p>The news of Kramm's transition to the professional world had been rumored for a long time, until early August of last year, when Kramm himself provided an answer: "I will maintain my amateur tennis player status until 1947." Because within that year, Kramm still had to shoulder two major tasks: from August 30 to September 1, he served as the top player in the US team at Forest Hills, and competed with the strong Australian team to defend the "Davis Cup"; secondly, in the Forest Hills International Tennis Tournament held from September 5 to 14, he had to fight to maintain his "men's singles throne" title.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The American People Hold Understanding <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The American people mostly have an understanding attitude towards Kramm's preparation to enter the professional world, because the year before, Coetzee and Van Rlot relied on their own strength to return the "Davis Cup," which had been lost for many years, from Australia back to the United States, and this great achievement still makes them grateful. At that time, it was rumored that the professional world was willing to offer 50,000 US dollars to ask Kramm to go pro. - Another saying is that Riggs (the current international professional tennis champion) once told Kramm, advising him to give up his amateur status, guaranteeing that he would be able to harvest 50,000 US dollars for him within a year. Therefore, in order to defend last year's Davis Cup for the United States, Kramm, in his personal capacity, had in fact lost a considerable "annual salary."</p>
<p>This twenty-seven-year-old, golden-haired California boy, six feet one inch tall and weighing one hundred and sixty-eight pounds, has already become a father, so he has to strive for a position for the happiness of his family, and Kramm had to consider that cash wealth that tempted him to go pro.</p>
<p>Kramm's biological father worked for the "Union Pacific Railroad Company" for thirty-five years. No matter how difficult the situation, he would definitely try to provide him with a development opportunity for his son's innate love of sports. When Kramm held a basketball in his hand, Old Kramm built a basketball court in the backyard for him; if he saw that the son was interested in baseball, the father would play with him.</p>
<p>When Kramm was twelve years old, once, he returned home from a football game with a bruised and bleeding nose. His mother was shocked to see this and quickly used three dollars and fifty cents to buy him a tennis racket, and they played together as father and son.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Kramo's Posture: Planning to Open a Shop in the Future <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Now that Kramo has become famous in one fell swoop, he plans to raise funds in the future to open a "Sports Equipment Shop," with his father acting as manager. He says, "In the business world, the old man's mind is better than mine."</p>
<p>Before the war, Kramo studied at the University of Southern California. He currently has no intention of continuing his studies. Newspaper articles on tennis and some books on hunting experiences summarize his current reading time. For half his life, he has single-mindedly pursued one firm and sincere idea: "I want to become the best tennis player in the world."</p>
<p>Long before he reached the age of sixteen, Kramo had already gained the opportunity to compete against veteran predecessors such as Van Rines, Tilden, and Pan Lai, receiving their guidance. Van Rines even provided coaching matches twice a week – a necessary course for the birth of the second generation of California tennis, with Van imparting to him "attack and power."</p>
<p>At the age of seventeen, Kramo won both the "All-American Youth" and "All-American Schoolboy" singles championships and was ranked as the tenth-best player in the United States. He was also hailed as the reincarnation of Van Rines because Kramo's appearance closely resembled Van's. Kramo also partnered with another California tennis player, Schroder, in doubles, winning the national championship for two consecutive years. At that time, he was only nineteen years old, but he was not satisfied with this.</p>
<p>In 1943, he reached the All-American singles final but unfortunately lost to Schroeder due to skin poisoning. After that, he joined the Coast Guard and experienced five Pacific landings, holding a racket for thirteen months.</p>
<p>The year before last, he went to England to participate in the Wimbledon tournament. Due to a skin disease outbreak, he lost to Czech player Trolley, but Kramo himself made a statement saying that it was Trolley who defeated him, and it had nothing to do with the skin disease. He did not resort to excuses, nor did he need to shirk responsibility. Later, facts proved that in the Lynn Hill Conference in September of the year before last, he indeed won the singles championship, creating the great achievement of winning five singles matches and losing only one set. In December, he and Schroder attended the Davis Cup, winning back the championship for the United States and establishing indelible merit.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Having Achieved His Long-Cherished Wish, He Announces His Retirement <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Last July, the Wimbledon Cup was held in England. As a result of the global players competing, the men's singles championship was still held by Kramo. London newspapers praised him as one of the best players in Wimbledon history. From August 30th to September 1st, Kramo and his old partner Schroder represented the United States team in the defense of the Tai Cup against the Australian team, achieving a complete victory in singles, defeating the Australian team by four to one. On September 14th, in the Lynn Hill All-American Lawn Tennis Singles Championship final, he defeated Parker by three to two, retaining the championship. Having achieved his long-cherished wish, Kramo used this brilliant record to transfer to the professional world. (Qian Changnian)</p>

<p>US Navy Basketball Powerhouse: The Duros Arrives in Shanghai from Qingdao</p>
<p>With Strong Strength, It Once Greatly Defeated Incas; Basketball Committee Arranges Confrontation Schedule</p>
<p>In order to improve the level of basketball in this city, the Basketball Committee had previously telegraphed to invite the Canadian Red Rose team to Shanghai, but the team declined due to vacation reasons. The Basketball Committee then entrusted the Associated Press to invite the Qingdao US Navy powerhouse "Duros" basketball team to Shanghai on its behalf. It is learned that the "Duros" team was recently transferred to Shanghai and, after arriving, had a friendly match with the Xiqing powerhouse Incas team. As a result, Duros easily defeated Incas by more than 20 points. Its strong strength can be imagined. The Basketball Committee revealed that it is already arranging the confrontation schedule and will soon decide to have the leading strong teachers in Shanghai compete against it.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Application Cases for Finished Product Acquisition: The Fourth United Branch Started Handling Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Review by the Industry and Banking Bureau and then Transferred to the United Headquarters for Review</p>
<p>In order to rescue manufacturers in this city who are generally facing difficult situations, the government previously drafted "Measures for Shanghai National Industry and Banking Bureau to Collect Finished Products from Manufacturers on Behalf of the Government" by the Fourth United Office as an emergency measure to cope with the Lunar New Year. The Fourth United Office held a meeting the night before last, presided over by Hua Gongyun, to convene the responsible persons of various industry and banking bureaus to discuss technical matters related to the implementation of the acquisition of finished products from manufacturers. Cai Gongchun, Li Renzai, Huangfu, Diao Minren, Fang Tinghua, Ma Jiping, Sun Rui, Qian Zuling, Pan Zhonglin, and others attended. It was resolved that starting yesterday (30th), the various industry and banking bureaus will conduct a preliminary review first, and then transfer it to the Fourth United Headquarters for review. It was also decided that starting on the 2nd of next month, the Fourth United Branch will hold a meeting every afternoon to exchange views and review these application cases. The deadline for application is the 7th of next month. The application forms for various manufacturers have been printed and can be obtained from the industry and banking bureaus as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan issued a statement on US aid for self-help a few days ago, both China and foreign countries paid close attention. Among the ten items set for the implementation of financial and economic reforms, the fourth item is "The stirring of supplies must be strengthened and the scope of the section must be expanded to prevent speculation and sharp rises in prices." According to this statement, it is heard that the government will implement stricter controls on daily necessities such as rice, fuel, and cloth in the future in order to grasp materials and stabilize prices.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Correcting Resolutions of the Cotton Spinning Industry: Chairman Yuan Issues a Statement, Believing That the Government Cannot Accept Six Opinions <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Management Committee issued a statement on the resolutions of the Cotton Spinning Association, saying: The resolutions of the general meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association regarding the various management rules of this office are unreasonable and should be corrected as follows:</p>
<p>The resolution of the general meeting of the members is that entrusted spinning and weaving should be carried out by contract, and it is difficult to accept anything that exceeds the scope of entrusted spinning and weaving.</p>
<p>The central government's decision to implement full control of cotton yarn and cloth this time is an integral part of the overall policy of economic suppression of chaos. Since the government has added controls, it can exercise everything by command. From the government's point of view, it must be thoroughly implemented and no obstruction or resistance is allowed. How can it be regarded as an ordinary commercial event and requested to be carried out by contract? Its unreasonableness is obvious.</p>
<p>Recommending representatives to draft and publish a declaration on the crisis of this industry.</p>
<p>The government is always supporting and caring for the national textile industry. The reason why I came out to preside over this time is also based on this idea, hoping to make this textile industry increasingly prosperous while still managing it. At the beginning of my tenure, I have sincerely told my colleagues that there is no intention of destroying or exploiting them in the slightest. What is stipulated in the various implementation rules of this committee has absolutely taken care of the interests and status of manufacturers. The declaration of the textile crisis is really an unnecessary worry.</p>
<p>Recommending representatives to state their opinions and requests.</p>
<p>In order to seek thorough cooperation and integrate officials and businessmen, I have tried my best to adopt opinions that can be accepted within the possible range. Facts have proven that the association's various requirements in the past have been met, and there is no need to say more. The six opinions raised by the Sixth District Association this time are close to coercion. From the government's point of view, it is really impossible to accept them. I have to express my deep expectations to all members of the association. The heads of the association's factories are mostly well-known and enlightened figures in society. They should have already clearly distinguished between public and private matters, and not completely focus on their own private interests, just like the previous joint distribution and price negotiation work, which are often opposed. Therefore, it is hoped that the association's few members who do not understand very well can be enlightened at any time to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>There is no need to set up resident factory specialists, which is considered a waste of national funds and breeds malpractices. Whether the implementation of management policies can be thorough depends on whether the management methods are suitable. In order to understand the working conditions of each factory, this committee has stipulated that personnel should be stationed in the factories, but the association publicly opposed it on the grounds that there is no need to set them up, which is ridiculous. Moreover, this committee is extremely strict in the assessment, selection, and training of the personnel to be stationed in the factories. They have not yet been dispatched. How can they know that there will be malpractices? As for the waste of national funds, it has nothing to do with the manufacturers and there is no need to use it as an excuse. This is completely a statement that does not understand the position and despises the government.</p>
<p>Raw cotton in each factory is scarce and needs to be replenished urgently. If the Yarn Management Committee cannot supply it in time, they will be forced to stop work, and the Yarn Management Committee should be fully responsible for the serious consequences.</p>
<p>This office's unified purchase of raw cotton is to supply the needs of each yarn factory. The second quarter's cotton allocation and the General Office's cotton have already been transferred and allocated by the Central Bank. In the future, this committee will take over and, of course, will allocate it according to regulations. If we talk about being forced to stop work at this time, it is obviously an alarmist statement, obstructing important political affairs, and attempting to undermine the implementation of comprehensive management. If this kind of situation occurs, this committee will have to enforce the law in order to implement administrative orders.</p>
<p>In short, this committee hopes that all members of the Sixth District Association will cooperate sincerely so that this textile industry can thrive and sweep away the previous habits of seeking exorbitant profits and disregarding the overall situation. This is what I sincerely desire.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Cotton Yarn Slightly Increased; Fine Cloth Slightly Rose <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton yarn market, the Textile Construction Corporation opened for sale as usual, and the allocation was reduced. In the market situation, due to the still loose money supply, buyers took advantage of the low price to absorb some, and the local dealers also made up for some of their positions. However, the weaving factories' appetite was mediocre, and the market trend rose circuitously. By the time of closing, dealers sold out their profits, and it fell slightly.</p>
<p>Finally, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to rise by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 58.8 million yuan. Bao Guang rose by 800,000 yuan. In addition, 20-count Shuang Ma, 16-count, Guangming, and 10-count and other grades all stopped falling and rose. However, the prices of 40-count and 32-count grades fell mostly because they were still stagnant.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton market, the morning opening transaction was very clear. Then, the Hankou dealers absorbed 30 to 40 pieces of Si Junzi serge, and the price rose. However, by the noon closing, retail investors sold out. The local dealers were reluctant to absorb them due to the approaching end of the period, and the market was not supported. North Road buyers slightly purchased 12-pound Wu Fu and other fine cloths. As a result, the prices of Blue Chicken Caiqiu and other grades of fine cloths rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan and 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge and Zhigong also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The rest of the cloths showed little rise or fall.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw cotton market was stable. The Textile Construction Corporation had already opened prices, but private yarn factories still had no intention of entering. There were not many transactions by colleagues, and the transaction was stagnant again. The price was slightly soft, and the transaction was 660 bales. The delivery price to the factory was 6.25 million for Jingyang, the spot price was 5.993 million for Lingbao, 6.03 million for Jingyang, and 1.25 million to 1.26 million for Zhoupu seed cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Rayon Slightly Decreased; Factory-Managed Silk Goods Were Soft <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The rayon market initially showed a revolving pattern yesterday, but as a result, it decreased slightly. The opening price of 120-count Xu Zi Right Light was 89 million yuan in the morning, and there were also transactions at 95 million yuan. Later, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, the closing price fell to 70 million yuan. There was not much change in the afternoon, and the final selling price was 77.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory-managed silk market was slightly weak yesterday, and the transaction was still rare. There were no transactions for various grades of goods with orders, and the asking price was similar to the previous day. For spot goods, the first-class five-dan head was purchased by Mei Ya for five bales yesterday at a price of 91.5 million yuan. The high-end retail price was around 1 million yuan, and the mid-range retail price was around 90 million yuan, with only a few bales traded. There were no transactions for dried silk, and the market also lacked changes.</p>
<p>Silk Goods market saw the price of Zhenshi silk quilt cover fall yesterday. The Huaiqiang goods opened at around 40.2 million yuan, and then revolved between 2.5 million and 3 million yuan. The closing price was 3 million yuan, and the forward date was 7 million yuan. The asking price for Dacheng checkered crepe was around 165,000 yuan. The price of ordinary Hua Jin crepe was 13,000 yuan. The rest of the goods were stable.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 286 pieces, or 617 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 106 purchase orders. The price of 20-count Golden Double Chicken (poor quality) was 32.5 million yuan per piece, which did not exceed the negotiated price range.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Shanghai Stocks Opened Flat and Weak; Buying Sentiment Turned Strong at Closing <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai stocks still stood high at the opening price yesterday due to the two-day interest price. The pre-market was weak and unable to rise, and most of the time was spent in weakness. The same was true in the aftermarket. Before the closing, the strength of Nos. 148, 43, and 193 bought back, and the market ended at a high price.</p>
<p>The morning opening was still weak. Yong Yarn debuted at 730 yuan and 727 yuan. After the opening, it gradually rose from 727 yuan and 752 yuan to 747 yuan and 767 yuan. The off-market interest price still opened at 3.3 cents and 3.75 cents, falling back to 735 yuan and 754 yuan. Nos. 89 and other numbers continued to buy spot and forward, and the price rose again to 748 yuan and 770 yuan. However, Nos. 130 and other numbers closed at a high price, and the noon closing still retreated to 733 yuan and 757 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the five-year decline limit had a rebound, lowering it by 10%. China Textile Datong Tongyi underwear was still flat, and the rise and fall of the remaining stocks were small. The forward stock Jingfu rose slightly, Xin Guang was still flat, and the rest fell slightly. The off-market prices of various unlisted stocks were still flat and weak.</p>

No. 36 and other numbers were still sold, and they retreated to low prices of 742 yuan and 759 yuan. Nos. 148 and other numbers bought spot, and No. 193 also strongly bought forward. Once the reverse started, the buying momentum suddenly became strong, rising to high prices of 761 yuan and 780 yuan. Nos. 157 and other numbers applied pressure again, retreating to closing prices of 755 yuan and 779 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning closing, the spot stocks Yong Yarn, China Textile, Xinhe, China Silk, Commercial Press, Xin Guang, Lu An, China France, and Xinhua rose slightly. Wu He rose by half, Tongyi, Mei Ya, Hua Feng, Jingfu, Qin Xing, and Zhabei rose by half a percent. Hua Xin was still flat, and the rest fell slightly. There were no transactions in the forward stocks Hua Guan and Mei Ya, and the rest rose slightly. Various unlisted stocks in the off-market still showed a flat and weak state.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Stagnant <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds were stagnant yesterday with little change. The unified Bing opened at 66,000 in the morning, falling from 67,000 to 62,000, and then revolved around the closing price of the previous day.

Ye Guang Tram and Telephone showed little change.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Wuxi Commodity Prices Rebounded <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi, 30th] After He Yushu approved the price limit of white rice to be raised to 1.35 million, the National Bank issued more than 5 billion yuan again, and the money supply eased, so commodity prices rebounded.

<h3 id="e135">Chebai Clearing Plate Fell <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Due to the price of the combined allocation of the fifth and sixth phases of the He Company on Thursday, although the adjustment increased by 60,000 yuan, the chips increased, and Huaba was all available, so the market fell instead. For example, the lowest discount for a stack of semi-white was 45,000 yuan, and later it was 30,000 yuan. Other Shangluo were between 120,000 yuan. The association's clearing plate was 1.655 million yuan for spot 24 coarse white, 120,000 yuan for small. The price of 4.5 white bagged was 1.68 million yuan, and the price of 20 Taiwan sand was 1.63 million yuan, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan for small.

<p>Tea Market Steady and Smart</p>
<p>The various domestic teas that were fiercely hoarded by local and foreign buyers yesterday were still active in the market due to the still strong buying sentiment. In terms of prices, the sellers insisted on a firm stance due to the scarcity of goods. Although they did not continue to advance, they were still more stable than before. Looking at the future, it still looks promising. As for the foreign-owned tea market, the situation has always been calm, because exporters are still hesitant, and the owners are also holding on. The market is standing firm.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Cigarettes and Soap Continue to Fall Due to Oversupply <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the cigarette market, the prices of non-industry goods fell at the morning opening. Many who were short on funds sold out. It was also heard that Yongtaihe, Huacheng, and other factories would have a large number of shipments. Colleagues' absorption turned sluggish. As a result, the price of ten British Old Knife Two Cigarettes continued to fall by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The rest of the Chinese and foreign cigarettes also fell, ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the daily necessities soap market, due to the end of the month and the approaching end of the general period, the funds were locally short. Floating households stopped entering and turned out, and there were also sales of goods of the same quality. There were plenty of chips, and all parties were reluctant to enter, so the market was unable to rise. As a result, the prices of Gubben Arrow Knife Two Soaps fell by 10,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. In addition, the prices of Meili Henry and other soaps also fell slightly. The markets for Guanghua and Xiangmao soaps were firmer. Matches were also stagnant in sales, and both new and old brands fell. The price of kerosene was too high, and many people sold it off, so the market was flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Industrial Oil Sales Stagnant <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>In the industrial raw material market, the approaching end of the Lunar New Year and the approaching end of the general period made it difficult for various parties to trade actively, and the asking price frequently fell. The listed price of Moon Brand caustic soda was 48-49 million, but there were still no transactions. Coconut oil was slightly bullish, trading at 6 million yuan. The ground price of Vaseline was still firm, but the price of potassium persulfate had fallen by 20%.</p>
<p>Due to weak overseas telegrams, the local market for tung oil was still called, and the market was low. Merchants with sufficient volume still asked for 3 million yuan, and Fu Xihong asked for 3.5 million yuan, a discount of slightly more than 10%.</p>
<p>Due to the excessive annual sales of candle making shops, the price of Wuheben asphalt was 4.8 million per load, and the price of shredded snow was 4.5 million. Although the price was low, the transaction was still light.</p>
<p>Since soap factories rarely bought large quantities of beef tallow, the asking price for Bengbu oil was 4.23 million yuan, and Taotao oil could also be bought for an additional 200,000 yuan. The market was relatively strong.</p>

<h3 id="e140">An Exploration of the Structure and Sources of Sima Qian's *Records of the Grand Historian* <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Liqi</p>
<p>In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, The Biography of Dayuan, the Grand Historian said: "The *Yu Benji* says that the Yellow River originates from the Kunlun Mountains…" In the Hereditary House of Wei, the Grand Historian said: "I have read the Hereditary Houses saying…" Zhao Yi's *Gaiyu Congkao* argues, based on this, that "The names *Benji* (Basic Annals) and *Shijia* (Hereditary Houses) both have their origins; only the name *Zhuan* (Biographies) was created by Sima Qian himself." Yu Wanhu's *Loubitan San* states: "Xu Guang's commentary on the Biography of Lord Pingyuan quotes the Biography of Lord Wei, saying: 'Zhao Huiwen Wang's younger brother.' Thus, the name *Zhuan* also has its origins."</p>
<p>Now, examining the arguments of Zhao and Yu, all are open to discussion: In the *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties* of the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the single-volume *Suoyin* (Collected Explanations) states: "Emperor Lin Xin, or Feng Xin, is written as Zu Xin in the Basic Annals, which is an error." *Xi Ben* is actually *Shi Ben* (Book of Generations), which the Lesser Sima changed to avoid the Tang taboo. In the Zuo Commentary, year 21 of Duke Xiang, it says: "Yi Yin exiled Tai Jia and served as his prime minister." Du Yu's commentary states: "Tai Jia was Tang's grandson." The *Zhengyi* (Correct Meaning) says: "That Tai Jia was Tang's grandson is recorded in the *Shi Benji* (Book of Generations Annals)." Thus, *Shi Ben* had an *Annals* section to record the genealogies of emperors and kings, which was an old style of the *Zuo Commentary*. In the Hereditary House of Tian of Qi in the *Records of the Grand Historian*: "Duke Zhuang died in the tenth year, and his son Tai Gong He took the throne." The *Suoyin* states: "According to the *Xi Ben* (Genealogical Book) and *Xi Jia* (Genealogical House) (variant name of the Shi Ben), from Chengzi to the destruction under King Jian, there were only ten generations." In the Zuo Commentary, year 3 of Duke Huan: "Duke Wu of Quwo attacked Ji, camping at Xingting; Han Wan drove the chariot, and Liang Hong was the right-hand warrior." The commentary states: "Duke Wu was the son of Zhuang Bo of Quwo, and Han Wan was the younger brother of Zhuang Bo." The *Zhengyi*: "That Duke Wu was the son of Zhuang Bo, and Han Wan was the younger brother of Zhuang Bo, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Also, in the Zuo Commentary, year 2 of Duke Min: "He established Duke Dai with Lu Qian Cao." The commentary states: "Duke Dai's name was Shen." The *Zhengyi*: "Duke Dai's name was Shen, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Also, in the Zuo Commentary, year 11 of Duke Xiang: "The ancestors of the seven surnames and twelve states." The commentary states: "Actually thirteen states, saying twelve is an error." The *Zhengyi*: "Seven surnames and thirteen states, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Also, in the first year of Duke Ding: "Established the Yang Gong." The commentary states: "The Yang Gong was the son of Bo Qin." The *Zhengyi*: "That the Yang Gong was the son of Bo Qin, is recorded in the *Shi Ben Shijia*." Thus, the name *Shijia* also comes from the *Zuo Commentary*, not created by Sima Qian himself. The *Book of Han*, Biography of Sima Qian, eulogy says: "Therefore, Sima Qian relied on the *Zuo Commentary* and *Guoyu* and excerpted from the *Shi Ben*." (The *Book of Later Han*, Biography of Ban Biao, says, "The Grand Historian Sima Qian excerpted from the *Zuo Commentary* and *Guoyu*, and revised the *Shi Ben*.") This shows that it was well known. As for Xu Guang quoting the Biography of Lord Wei, this was probably also from the *Shi Ben*. The Hereditary House of Wei in the *Records of the Grand Historian* says: "The grandson of Huanzi was called Wenhou Du." The *Suoyin*: "The *Xi Ben* (genealogical book) says: 'Huanzi gave birth to Wenhou Si.' Its biography says: 'Ruzi Lei was the son of Wei Ju.' This is also different from this genealogical line." It is clear that *Shi Ben* contained biographies. And the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Biography of Boyi*, the first entry, the Grand Historian says: "I am saddened by the intentions of Boyi. Having seen the lost poems, one can feel his unusualness; its biography says: Boyi and Shuqi..." The *Suoyin*: "According to its biography, it is the *Outer Commentary of the Han Poems* and *Lüshi Chunqiu*. Its biography says..." Thus, the category of *Liezhuan* (Biographies) was probably also based on earlier precedents. The *Book of Sui*, Biography of Wei Dan, records Fan Hua's words: "The *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the writing is too brief, and it often misses the forms of events. The contemporary imitations are therefore too short. *Annals and Biographies* is a transformation of what was done by the historians Ban and Ma; it comprehensively gathers the events and meanings of an era, thoroughly understanding them. Later scholars see this as superior, so they continue to write in this style." (This probably comes from the Preface to the *Book of Later Han*.) The general idea is that "In ancient books, anything recording events, establishing arguments, and interpreting classics was called a *Zhuan*, not solely recording the deeds of one person; that which solely records one person as a *Zhuan* began with Qian." (From *Notes on the Twenty-Two Dynastic Histories*.) Wei Zong's statement that the "Annals and Biographies style was a transformation of what was done by Ban" is extremely insightful.</p>
<p>Zhao Yi's *Notes on the Twenty-Two Dynastic Histories* says: "The Records of the Grand Historian made ten tables, imitating the genealogical records of officials, complementing the annals and biographies." Shen Tao's *Tong Yidouzai Suibi* says, "Table (表) is like saying 'genealogy (谱),' a phonetic transformation." Now, I believe both Zhao and Shen's statements are correct. The *Book of Liang*, Biography of Liu Yao, quotes Huan Tan's *Xin Lun*: "The Grand Historian's *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties* runs sideways and diagonally upward, all imitating the Zhou genealogies." (Also see the *Treatise on Tables and Calendars* in the *Shi Tong* and the Introduction to the *Tongzhi*.) That the Grand Historian created tables based on Zhou genealogies was already said by the Han people. Now, examining what the Grand Historian himself said he used, the Preface to the *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties* says: "I have read genealogical records; since the Yellow Emperor, all have years. Examining their historical records and the transmission of the Five Virtues from beginning to end, the ancient texts are all different and contradictory. The Master did not discuss and order their years; how could this be empty? Therefore, using the Five Emperors' tight records, the *Shangshu* compiled generations, recording from the Yellow Emperor to the Gonghe Regency, as the *Chronological Table*." The Preface to the *Chronological Table of the Twelve Feudal Lords* says: "The Grand Historian read the *Spring and Autumn Annals* historical records and genealogies." It also says: "The Han prime minister Zhang Cang recorded historical records of the Five Virtues." And also: "Genealogical records only record generations and posthumous titles; their words are brief, wanting a complete view of the important points is difficult." The Grand Historian's Autobiography says: "The Three Dynasties were long ago, and the years cannot be examined. They were probably taken from genealogical records, I heard they were based on this, so I roughly deduced and made the *Chronological Table of the Three Dynasties*, the first." It also says, "After You and Li, the Zhou dynasty declined, and the feudal lords monopolized power; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* did not record everything. But genealogical records comprehensively recorded the waxing and waning of the Five Hegemons. Wanting to see the order of succession through generations, I made the *Chronological Table of the Twelve Feudal Lords*, the second." All of this can be examined to see the source of his materials and the reason for his style.</p>
<p>As for the "Treatises", the *Suoyin* to the *Treatise on Rites* says: "Treatises are the general name for the Five Classics and Six Arts. These eight treatises record the great structure of the state; Ban Gu called them *Zhi* (Records), Zhi meaning recording." The *Zhengyi* also says: "The Five Classics and Six Arts are all called 'Shu' (Treatises)." The *Treatise on Treatises and Records* in the *Shi Tong* says: "Laws, rites, music, customs, mountains, and rivers, are sought in writings, originating from the Three Rites. And when Ban Gu and Sima Qian wrote history, they separately created Treatises and Records. Examining what they recorded, they mostly followed the Rites Classics. And outside of the Records and Biographies, there are things not fully covered; single words and phrases are fully recorded here. Speaking of their thoroughness and breadth, one truly believes in the author's vast knowledge." Now, I believe that the explanations of the *Suoyin*, *Zhengyi*, and *Shi Tong* are quite acceptable. Most of the Five Classics and Six Arts are books explaining institutions and laws; the Grand Historian's Eight Treatises, not only is their grand name based on the classics, but the sources they drew upon can also be found in the classics. After Ban Gu's book, there were those who directly explored the meaning of the Grand Historian's name of "Treatises" and called them "Dian" (Canon); their name is closer to the ancient usage than Ban Gu's *Zhi* and Cai Yong's intention.</p>
<p>The above describes several aspects; regarding the exploration of the structure and sources of the Grand Historian's book, perhaps one can gain some understanding. And the *Wenxin Diaolong*, *Treatise on History*, says: "Extending to the Grand Historian Tan, the world only holds to brevity; Zichang continued his ambition, discerningly ordering the emperors' actions. Comparing to Yao's calling [officials] to the Canon, their positions mix with the middle-ranked worthies; emulating the classics in binding titles, their writing is not like the original sages. Therefore, he took his model from the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, generally calling it *Annals*. The title of *Annals* is also a grand title." The Qing scholar Yan Shishu, continuing Yan He's explanation, argued that the Grand Historian's Basic Annals took its model from the *Lüshi Chunqiu*; also see *Yuan Xiang Tong Yi Lu*, volume two. Zhang Xuecheng of Kuaiji, in his *Xiaochou Tongyi*, also said, "The book of Lü is what Sima Qian took as his model: the Twelve Basic Annals imitate its Twelve Monthly Records, the Eight Treatises imitate its Eight Overviews; the Seventy Biographies imitate its Six Discussions; thus, there is also a slight bit of eclecticism." These are all baseless arguments.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Two Letters Discussing "Yu Yi" <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shi</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Shuda Sends to Mr. Qian Xuantong</p>
<p>Mr. Xuantong:</p>
<p>The other day I heard Mr. Hu Shi explain that the "Yu" character in "Yu Yi Cai Pin, Yu Zhao Yu Zhi" etc. is "in what place" and that the tone is extremely similar. But in translating "Yu" as "in what place," I do not know how Mr. Hu explains the character "Yi". I think that the character "Yu" still maintains the meaning of the word "zai" (in), while the character "Yi" can have the explanation of "what place." Further, "Xia zui qi ru tai" (How can we blame Xia?), "Jin wang qi ru tai" (How can the current king be thus?) Sima Qian translates "Ru Tai" as "Nai He" (What to do). In the Book of Han, "Ru he bu kuang" (If they were not to correct him), in Fa Yan, "Yan min zhi zi qi ru tai" (What can be done about the sons of Yan Min?) "Ru Tai" all have the meaning of "Nai He." Considering the character "Tai" from the perspective of "mu" (eye), it already has the meaning of "He" (what, which), then the character "Mu" and "He" have the same sound, and it also ought to have the meaning of the character "He." Having the meaning of "He" can also be extended to have the meaning of "what place." (Such as the character "Yan") Thus, "Yu Yi Cai Pin? Yu Zhao Yu Zhi. Yu Yi Qiu Zhi? Yu Lin Zhi Xia" the character "Yu" in the above and below sentences can be uniformly explained, and the character "Yi" has more basis, and will not become redundant. I do not know what you and Mr. Hu think.</p>
<p>I have proven before that the character "Yu" has the meaning of the character "Yi." (Within the Supplement to Examples of Doubtful Ancient Phrases) Then, in reverse, the character "Yi" can also have the meaning of the character "Yu." If one translates "Yu" as "What Place," and also translates "Yi" as "Yu," it would be too entangled. What do you say? I wish you health, Shuda</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Xuantong Sends to Hu Shi</p>
<p>Shi Zhi:</p>
<p>Yang Yufu wrote to me to discuss the issue of "Yu Yi." I think he has great insights. The sentence he cited, "Yu Yi Qiu Zhi, Yu Lin Zhi Xia," is very worthy of study. The character "Tai" in "Ru Tai," previous people seemed to all think that it was the transformation of the character "He," although it can be barely said, the sound (yun) seems to be still a bit off. ("Tai's" ancient sound is in the Ying Niu Hai Yun, and its value is approximately [blank space], "He's" ancient sound is in the Xia Niu [blank space] Yun, and its value is approximately [blank space].) If the character "Yi" has the meaning of "He," then the character "Tai" does not need to be [blank space] with the character "He." "Yi" was written in ancient times as [ancient character], and "Tai" was written as [ancient character], with Mu (eye) making the sound. The character "Si" is sometimes written as "Shi," all of which can be used as evidence that the two characters can be used interchangeably. But I do not know if Mr. Yang's proof still has heterodox meaning in it? What is your opinion? I hope you will enlighten me. Your younger brother Xuantong (1922, 10, 3)</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, I began to study the empty words in the Book of Poetry. At that time, I pointed out that the sentences "Yu Yi Cai Pin, Yu Zhao Yu Zhi" (Where to gather artemisia? In the marsh and on the islet), "Yu Yi Yong Zhi, Gong Hou Zhi Shi" (Where to use it? In the service of lords and dukes), and other such sentences were all questions in the first sentence, and answers in the second sentence. Where to gather artemisia? In the marsh and on the islet. Where to use them? In the service of lords and dukes. This was agreed by a group of friends. But at that time, I especially paid attention to the many examples of the character "Yu" being used as an adverb, such as "Yu Fei" (Fly), which means "Fei Yan" (fly where), fly to what place. "Yu Gui" (Return), which means "Gui Yan" (return where), return to what place. Therefore, I initially argued that "Yu Yi" was a kind of inverted ancient grammar, the same as "Shi Yi" (therefore), "He Yi" (why), and "Suo Yi" (the reason). "Yu" is "what place," or "what," and "Yi" is an inverted preposition. This statement seems even more plausible in the "Shao Nan Cai Pin" chapter of the Book of Poetry, "Yu Yi Sheng Zhi? Wei Kuang Ji Ju. Yu Yi Xiang Zhi? Wei Qi Ji Fu." (Where to put them? In baskets and hampers. Where to offer them? In pots and pans). The grammar of these two places, "Yu Yi" and "He Yi," is very similar.</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Yang Yufu learned of this statement and wrote to Mr. Qian Xuantong, suggesting that the character "Yi" be interpreted as "He" (What), while the character "Yu" remains a preposition. This statement seems easier to understand than my original proposal, so Xuantong and I later accepted it. Hu Shi, 1948, 1, 23</p>
<h3 id="e142">On the "Playing the Xiao for Funerals" Theory <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Gongwan</p>
<p>Yu Zhengxie's "Gui Si Cun Gao" (Collected Manuscripts from the Year Gui Si) (part of the Zheyun Congshu Series), volume eleven, in the section "Playing the Xiao for Funerals," states:</p>
<p>The Records of the Grand Historian, Hereditary House of Zhou Bo, says: "First, he made a living by weaving thin mats, and often played the xiao for people's funerals." Ru Chun's Jiejie (Collected Explanations) says: "Entertaining guests at funerals with music, like actors." Chen Zan says: "Playing the xiao to entertain guests at funerals is like musicians." The Suoyin says: "The Zuo Commentary says 'singing at the bier,' like today's funeral dirges, the singers often hold the xiao and pipe." The annotation in the Book of Han, Biography of Bo, Shigu uses Chen Zan's explanation. Now, according to Suoyin, it is correct. The xiao is not a panpipe, but a vertical xiao, also called a bugle; referring to the reed of the xiao, blown to make sound; this was the funeral ritual of the Qin and Han dynasties, not for entertaining guests with music. The two meanings of "bugle" are: one is a short xiao. The Song Shu, Treatise on Music, says: "Bugles are short xiao and nao songs." Guo Maoqian's Yuefu Jieti says: "Bugles are short xiao and nao songs; , horizontal blowing, Qi Jiao and so on." The other is the name of music. The Book of Han, Biography of Han Yanshou, says: "Drum carts, bugle carts, and various imperial procession bugles," Chen Lin's proclamation says: "Ascending to high hills and beating drums and bugles." Zhao Sheng of the Song Dynasty's Chaoye Leiyao says: "Bugles are the Taichang music of the Ministry of Rites. Generally, refined music is played at the military gate and the front of the camp, without bells, chimes, xun, zhu, qin, or se, only drums, cymbals, nao, [blank character], flutes, and fifes." Funeral processions use short [blank character] to regulate movement; and to prevent the dead from causing harm, not for entertaining guests with music. Later, bells and jingles were used. The Jin Shu, Treatise on Five Elements, says: "During the time of the Duke of Haixi, Shou Xi sang funeral dirges, shaking a large bell." Also, during the Liang Dynasty, Xie Jiqing held a bell and sang funeral dirges. According to the Tang system, the funeral dirge singers wore sackcloth similar to those who wailed and took the place of mourners. In Li Wa's Biography in the Taiping Guangji: the second-rate vendors of funereal instruments were better able, and advanced holding bells, also to regulate movement. Summarizing Yu's opinions, he believed that</p>
<p>1. The short xiao is also called a bugle, and bugles have two meanings, one is short xiao and nao songs.</p>
<p>2. Funeral processions use short xiao to regulate their movement.</p>
<p>3. Funeral processions use short xiao to regulate their movement, and later, bells and jingles were used.</p>
<p>These are all errors from the wise despite a thousand considerations. According to Guo Maoqian's book, the lyrics of bugle songs contain eighteen Han nao songs, none of which are funeral dirges. And in the collection of Xianghe songs, there are thirty-two ancient songs, including "Hao Lu" and "Hao Li." The Tongzhi, Yue Lue, says: "Also called 'Heaven and Earth Funeral Songs,' also called 'Funeral Procession Songs.'" The Jin Shu, Treatise on Music, says: "All the existing ancient lyrics of music chapters are street songs and ballads from the Han Dynasty: 'South of the River Can Pick Lotuses,' 'The Island Bears Fifteen Children,' 'Ballad of White Hair,' and the like, which were later gradually adapted into orchestral music, which is the 'Xianghe' songs." The Song Shu, Treatise on Music: "'Xianghe' is an old Han song; strings and bamboo harmonize with each other, and the conductor sings." Therefore, funeral dirges emphasize singing, but in terms of their harmony, Zhou Bo's playing of the xiao was still related to the funeral dirge. The xiao played by Zhou Bo (and what Wu Zixu played when begging for food in the Wu market as recorded in the Records of the Grand Historian) may have been a short xiao, but it does not necessarily mean that it was a bugle. Yu's reason for interpreting the short xiao as a bugle is probably due to the idea that "funeral processions use short xiao to regulate movement" being entrenched in his mind. Because it "regulates movement," it uses the music played at the military gate and the front of the camp. But in fact, funeral dirges are used when "setting out the coffin," and funeral dirges are also used when performing the ritual of "ancestral sacrifices" at home, as the Song Shu (volume sixty-nine), Biography of Fan Hua, says:</p>
<p>Ye was promoted to the position of assistant minister of the Ministry of Personnel. In the winter of the first year of the Yuanjia era, the Pengcheng Prince's concubine died, and as she was about to be buried, on the night of the "ancestral sacrifice," colleagues and former subordinates all gathered at the Eastern Mansion. Hua's younger brother, Guangyuan, was then the libationer of the Ministry of Education and was on duty that day. Ye, along with Wang Shen, a subordinate of the Secretary of Education, and his younger brother Guangyuan, stayed up, drinking heavily in the middle of the night, opening the north window and listening to funeral dirges as entertainment. Pengcheng Yikang was furious and demoted Hua to the position of prefect of Xuancheng.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the Han Dynasty, wedding banquets also used funeral dirges to add to the fun, as Ying Shao's Fengsu Tong (cited in Yulan, volume 552) says</p>
<p>In the capital, at wedding banquets and festive gatherings, after the drinking reached its peak, funeral dirges were used as entertainment. This has nothing to do with regulating the movement of funeral carriages. Since funeral dirges emphasize singing, and the xiao player cannot sing at the same time, Yu Xi shaking the bell, Ji Qing holding the bell, and the singer in Li Wa's Biography advancing holding the bell, all involve singing on one side and shaking the bell on the other. Shaking the bell is to keep time for the song, not to regulate the movement of funeral carriages (the funeral dirge singer in Li Wa's Biography ascends the platform and sings, and there is no funeral carriage following). Therefore, the bell is not a substitute for the short xiao. Sima Zhen said: "The Zuo Commentary says 'singing at the bier' (this is in the eleventh year of Duke Ai. Du Yu's annotation: 'Singing at the bier is a song for sending off the funeral.') is like today's funeral dirges, the singers often hold the xiao and pipe." This indicates that in the Tang Dynasty, people still harmonized with funeral dirges with the xiao and pipe, which is what is meant by "strings and bamboo harmonize with each other," which is also what is meant by "playing the xiao for funerals"; and advancing holding the bell is what is meant by "the conductor sings." However, in later generations, it seems that there were very few who harmonized with the xiao and pipe, so in Li Wa's Biography, he only praised him for harmonizing with the funeral dirge singer. Furthermore, as the Book of Later Han (volume ten), Treatise on Rituals, says:</p>
<p>According to rituals, upon ascension... the Yu Lin orphans and Ba Yu selected sixty singers to form six rows, with eight bell directors holding bells.</p>
<p>These eight people were singers, and the sixty people were harmonizers. Zhuangzi, Da Zong Shi, says</p>
<p>Zi Sanghu, Meng Zifan, and Zi Qinzhang were friends... When Zi Sanghu died, before he was buried, Confucius heard of it and sent Zigong to attend to the funeral arrangements. Some arranged music, some played the qin, harmonizing and singing, saying: "Alas, Sanghu! Alas, Sanghu! He has reverted to his true state, and yet I still consider myself human."</p>
<p>Cheng Xuanying annotates "attending to" as "providing for the funeral arrangements"; and "arranging music" should also be the "weaving thin mats" mentioned in the Hereditary House of Zhou Bo. Cheng's annotation also says</p>
<p>"Alas" is the sound of the song. "Sanghu" and following is the harmonizing phrase. "Yi" is the harmonizing sound. Therefore, the ritual of funeral dirges existed before the Qin and Han Dynasties. The Tan Gong records that when Yuan Rang's mother died, he climbed a tree and sang. Also, when Zhuangzi's wife died, he also sang while knocking on a basin. These all have their background in customs. However, Confucianism, regarding funeral rites, emphasizes "grief in countenance and sorrow in weeping" (Mencius, Teng Wengong); therefore, the Book of Rites, Qu Li, says: "If there is a funeral in the neighborhood, do not sing in the alley," and the Analects also says: "When the Master ate beside someone mourning, he never ate his fill; when the Master cried on this day, he did not sing." (Huang Ben connects these two chapters) Therefore, the custom of funeral dirges is incompatible with the spirit of Confucianism, and it is not recorded in the classics. Confucianism, regarding contemporary customs, "transmitted but did not create," only rationalized them; and everything that did not conform to its spirit was rejected. In terms of funerals, killing animals to send off the dead (Youzi, Treatise on Rites), burning them, exposing them, dressing them in firewood and abandoning them in ditches (Liezi, Yang Zhu), were all rejected by Confucianism, and it had its choices and its theories. Judging from what is recorded in the Da Zong Shi, it should be a type of funeral dirge, and the Records of the Grand Historian's Zhou Bo playing the xiao and Zhuangzi's "some played the qin" refer to the harmonization of strings and bamboo; Yuan Rang's knocking on the tree and Zhuangzi's drumming on the basin are the holding of time. This custom, although not accepted by Confucianism, was rationalized by Daoism.</p>
<p>This custom was still popular during the Yuan and Ming dynasties, so the Water Margin (chapter twenty-three) records the proverb "The coffin has come out, ask for the funeral dirge singer's money." (The transcription of this was completed on the 28th of the ninth month of the thirty-sixth year.)</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Sources of Material for *The Scholars* <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Xianlin</p>
<p>Of all Chinese novels, apart from *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the one I like most is *The Scholars*. Usually, when I read miscellaneous books, I write down anything related to *The Scholars*. Now, looking at my notes, I have written quite a lot. Many of these items have been noticed by other scholars as well (see Lu Xun's *Xiaoshuo Jiuwen Chao*, Kong Lingjing's *Zhongguo Xiaoshuo Shiliao*, and Jiang Ruizao's *Xiaoshuo Kaozheng*). But there are still a few items that no scholar has noticed before, and in my opinion, these items can give us more insight into the question of the sources of material for *The Scholars*, so I will transcribe them below and discuss them.</p>
<p>You Tong's *Genqi Zaji* says</p>
<p>When Yuan Yian was the prefect, he spent his days enjoying himself with Weiqi and singing operas. The chief official satirized him, saying: "I heard that in your office, all one hears all day is the sound of Weiqi pieces, the sound of flutes, and the sound of operas, is that so?" Yuan said: "Yes, I hear them. In Your Honor's office, there are also three sounds all day." The chief official asked what sounds. Yuan said: "They are the sound of the abacus, the sound of the steelyard, and the sound of the board." The chief official was greatly angered and impeached him, causing him to lose his position.</p>
<p>Chu Renhuo's *Jianhu Ji Shiji*, volume one, also records the same story:</p>
<p>It was also heard that when Mr. (Yuan Yian) was in Wuchang, a certain circuit intendant said: "I heard there are two sounds in Your Honor's office: the sound of the singing boy and the sound of the opera." Mr. replied: "Your Lordship also has two sounds: the sound of the steelyard and the sound of the bamboo cane." The intendant remained silent, and before long Mr. hung up the impeachment memorial.</p>
<p>Both of these notes are about Yuan Yian, and are probably based on facts. The eighth chapter of *The Scholars* also has a similar story:</p>
<p>The former judicial commissioner Xiang said: "I heard there are three kinds of sounds coming from inside Prefect Guan's gate." Wang Shoudao said: "What three kinds?" [the] son said: "The sound of reciting poetry, the sound of singing, and the sound of opera." Prefect Wang smiled and said: "That's exactly what Zhao is thinking." [the] son said: "When the old gentleman shows his true colors, I'm afraid the sounds will change." Prefect Wang said: "What sounds?" The son said: "The sound of the battle-staff, the sound of the abacus, and the sound of the board."</p>
<p>There are two possibilities here: Prefect Wang Shoudao either alludes to Yuan Yian, or alludes to another person, and Wu Jingzi borrowed Yuan Yian's story and applied it to him.</p>
<p>Yuan Mei's *Suiyuan Shihua*, volume four, says</p>
<p>There have been many talented women in the past who could write poetry, why are there so few now? When I was the magistrate of Jiangning, there were two women from Songjiang named Zhang, living in a nunnery, who claimed to be related to Wen Min Gong. The elder sister's name was Wanyu, married into the Cheng family in Huaibei, but she did not get along with her husband and privately escaped. The magistrate of Shanyang sent a document to have them apprehended. When I released them, Wanyu presented a poem in the hall, saying: "In the depths of the lake, there are fragrant-sounding flowers, mistakenly entered the house of a Huaixi merchant, met the Bai Sima of Jiangzhou, dared to tell her grievances to the Pipa." I suspected that it was written by someone else, so the woman asked for a face-to-face test. I used the dry tree in the courtyard as the topic. The woman said: "Since Your Honor has allowed this handmaiden to write poetry, poets do not kneel. May I have paper and brush to write a poem while standing?" I allowed it. She leaned against a chair and wrote quickly, saying: "Standing alone in the empty courtyard for a long time, facing the sun every morning. Who can plant it, and move it to the backyard to be fragrant?" Before long, Magistrate Feng of Shanyang came, and I asked what to do with the Zhang women, saying: "This matter should not be decided by divorce; however, a talented woman marrying a vulgar merchant is not fitting. Therefore, release her from the crime of escaping, and let her return home." I asked how he knew she was talented. He said: "She presented a poem, saying: 'Weeping, I tell the gods and magistrates, please allow me to return to my homeland. In the future, I will transform into a Sichuan crow and bring blessings to your side.'" Feng was originally from Sichuan.</p>
<p>Isn't this exactly the female poet Shen Qiongzi written in chapters 40 and 41 of *The Scholars*?</p>
<p>Duan Chengshi's *Youyang Zazu*, volume one, says</p>
<p>At the end of the Tianbao era, Jiaozhi [tribute] dragon brain, shaped like silkworm. Persians said old dragon brains came from the tree joints. [Blank] was called the Dragon's Brain of Luck by the Forbidden City. The emperor only bestowed ten pieces on Lady Yang. The fragrance permeates more than ten paces. One summer day the Emperor and the imperial prince came to [blank] one evening to have He Huaizhi play the Pipa alone. Lady Yang would stand in front of the board and watch. The Emperor was about to lose several stones when Lady Yang put the Persian puppy on the Emperor's side. The puppy got on the board and messed up all the stones and the Emperor was very happy. At that time the wind blew Lady Yang's neckerchief on to He Huaizhi's hair band and after a long time it came off. When He Huaizhi returned he was unusually conscious of the fragrance and put it inside a silken sack. When the Emperor regained the palace he missed Yang very much and He offered up the band, recounting events of the day. The Emperor opened the bag and wept saying: "This is the luckiest fragrance".</p>
<p>The fifty-third chapter of *The Scholars* also has a similar story:</p>
<p>Chen Muna was about to lose again. Lady Ping held the black-and-white cat.</p>
<p>[The Cat] leapt over. The chess pieces were ruined. The story is exactly the same as Yang's. I don't believe that this is a co-incidence but that Wu had intentionally borrowed it.</p>
<p>The above are three examples. From just these three examples, I think that we should revise our previous understanding of the sources of material for *The Scholars*. People generally believe that the characters in *The Scholars* are mostly real people. Jin He's postscript in Shangyuan opened a list. Since then, others have made similar speculations. I do not deny that many of the characters in the book are allusions to real people; but if one says that since the people are real, the events should also be real, then there is a problem. The story of Zhang Tiebi is completely copied from *Guiyuan Congtan*, which other scholars have already pointed out. In the third example above, we pointed out that Lady Ping's story was copied from Yang's story. These are just two examples, but in fact, there are definitely more than just these two places where *The Scholars* borrows from previous notes or novels. From this we can see that Wu Jingzi is not simply trying to write biographies for these people in *The Scholars*, he is writing a novel, like other novelists. In previous novels or notes, as long as he saw useful material, he collected it and [blank] it into his own book. If readers truly believe that everything written in this book is about real people and real events, and listen to Jin He's words and search through [blank] Qian's collected essays, then it will be in vain.</p>

<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>During wartime, a plane unfortunately crashed in the northwest. After fifty-two hours, an air force headquarters reconnaissance plane discovered the wreckage. Immediately, personnel were dispatched to land and search for the pilot's whereabouts. In this vast expanse of desert, the pilot's body was found about two *li* away from the plane, with two bags of dried rations beside him. However, the veins in his wrist were bitten through, and his mouth and tongue were covered in bloodstains. It turned out that because he could not get a drop of water for three days, even though he was fortunate not to have died when the plane crashed, he eventually bit through his own veins in his desperate thirst, hoping to drink a mouthful of blood to moisten his throat. The pain of thirst without water is imaginable.</p>
<p>In the mid-18th century, when British power was actively expanding in India, the Indian Governor-General of Bengal imprisoned one hundred and forty-six British people in a small room, no more than a *fangzhang* (approximately ten square feet) in size. This room had only two small window openings. After one night, when the British government negotiated for their release, only twenty-three people near the small window openings came out alive. The remaining one hundred and twenty-three people all suffocated to death. The expressions of pain on their faces were beyond description. This is the famous "Black Hole of Calcutta" in history.</p>
<p>Legend has it that in ancient times, there was a cruel chieftain in Africa who imprisoned his prisoners, providing them with food, drink, clothing, and shelter, but forbidding them from sleeping. He tried various methods to prevent the prisoners from closing their eyes. After two days, the prisoners became extremely exhausted. Even under the lash of whips, they still fell soundly asleep. Finally, in less than four days, these poor people died under this particularly cruel form of torture. At the time of death, their two eyes bulged out, filled with bloodshot veins, and their entire bodies' blood turned black, resembling a *yaksha* ghost.</p>
<p>Water, air, and sleep are all the most common and ordinary things. We who live by the sea never suffer from a lack of water. You can breathe in and out as much as you want, and the air is inexhaustible. Eight hours of sufficient sleep every night also seem to make us unaware of the suffering of lacking sleep. However, the more commonplace and ordinary things in the world are, the more important and indispensable they are. As the saying goes, "Only when you are sick do you realize the true value of health, and only those on the verge of death understand the loveliness of life." Today, everything is expensive. If water and air also had to be bought with money, there would certainly be no shortage of people hoarding water and air, and it can be guaranteed that it would be easier to get rich than hoarding rice and firewood. Unfortunately, fate plays tricks on people. If food were like the water of the Huangpu River, wouldn't the disputes in the world be greatly reduced?</p>
<p>Humans are born to enjoy freedom from want. The Creator has given us water, air, and time, which we can take and use as we please. But we still need one indispensable thing – bread. This requires the cooperation of all mankind so that everyone can avoid deprivation.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Truman's Secretary <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, Charles Griffith Ross and Harry Truman attended the same school in Independence, Missouri. Only a few desks separated them. Today, they both work together in the President's Office of the United States, separated by only two doors. Their lives were closely linked together in their youth, and they understood each other deeply. However, when people asked Ross how he and Truman addressed each other, he replied apologetically, "I call him Mr. President, but he only calls me Charlie."</p>
<p>Ross's office has a thick oriental carpet, a black stove, bean-green walls, and photos of his two children hanging on them. In addition, there is a large photo of his predecessor, Steve Early, and two photos of Truman. From his window, there is a view of a lawn, pleasing to the eye. The overall style of the room is calm and peaceful, which matches Ross's personality.</p>
<p>His blue eyes are gentle, but not docile. He is thin and a little stooped. His chin is slightly prominent, and his nose is quite large. His personality is mostly expressed in his chin, although his eyes also express part of it. If necessary, he can be tenacious, but he can also be gentle. This is all expressed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Ross was originally a journalist. In 1931, he wrote an article criticizing the administration of then-US President Hoover, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Before entering the White House in 1945, he was a senior editor at the *St. Louis Post-Dispatch* and a prominent figure in the American press. He originally had no intention of going to the White House. This change of job meant leaving his beloved work and a decrease in income – the newspaper's annual salary was $35,000, while Truman only paid him $10,000.</p>
<p>President Truman firmly invited him to serve as his new secretary, but Joseph Pulitzer, the owner of the *Post-Dispatch*, did not want to let him go. Truman was forced to call him, saying that the invitation was an order issued in his position as President. Later, the *Post-Dispatch* reported on the front page: "Truman Kidnaps Ross."</p>
<p>The strength that Ross could provide for Truman was obvious. He had one of the most intelligent political minds in Washington, and he also had the special ability to accurately predict reactions. He gave Truman a broad understanding of many people. At his almost daily press conferences, he solved many problems for his master.</p>
<p>Ross arrived at the office every morning at 8:30, visited the President an hour later, and then handled the day's affairs. His most important task was to speak on behalf of the President at press conferences. Ross had worked in the news industry for forty years, and he knew the habits of journalists well. Therefore, he knew how to cater and how to avoid, and his answers were appropriate.</p>
<p>Before entering the White House, Ross had spared no effort in praising Truman's promotion to President. In April 1945, he wrote in the *Post-Dispatch*: "People call Truman an ordinary American, but he is actually stronger than ordinary people. He is not an insignificant person. He may not become a great president, but he will definitely become a good president."</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, from Independence to Washington, Ross and Truman have always been friends sharing the same boat. Americans say that the two of them are the "No. 1 Team" in the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Anping, editor of the *Observer Weekly*, said in his article "We Suggest the Government Investigate and Announce the White Paper Rationing Situation": "As far as this magazine is concerned, when we started publication in September 1946, the price of paper was only 25,000 yuan per ream, but now it has risen to about 1.5 million yuan, an increase of about 60 times. However, our selling price when we started publication was only 500 yuan per copy. Even with the current selling price of 7,000 yuan per copy, the selling price of this magazine has only increased 14 times. This is a definite fact that the price of paper has increased 60 times in the same period, while the selling price has only increased 14 times, and the contrast is so strong that people cannot help but feel shaken after seeing it. Unless the sales or selling price of newspapers, books, or magazines can increase proportionally to the price of white paper, they will eventually be drained of blood and sweat and collapse."</p>
<p>The facts cited by Mr. Chu are all facts, but it is not very reasonable to argue that the selling price of newspapers, books, and magazines should increase proportionally to the price of white paper, that is, if the price of white paper has increased 60 times since September 1946, then the price of newspapers, books, and magazines should also increase 60 times. Because we know that white paper is only one component in the making of a newspaper, book, or magazine. In addition, there are manuscript fees, typesetting costs, etc., all of which are indispensable. Unless the expenses of a newspaper, book, or magazine increase proportionally to the price of white paper, it is quite unreasonable to increase its selling price solely according to the price of white paper, which has increased the most. This is definitely not what our cultural circles should do or say.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, manuscripts are the most important raw material for books and periodicals. Readers spend money to buy books and magazines to read articles, not to look at white paper. Therefore, the value of articles should be above white paper. This was indeed the case before the war. Some magazines—such as *Life* and *China Youth Weekly*—paid manuscript fees of more than ten yuan per thousand words, which meant that the value of a writer's thousand words could buy two or three to four or five reams of white paper. Normally, it was three to five yuan per thousand words, which was also the price of one ream of paper. But what about now? White paper is one of the items whose price has risen the most crazily since the war, and the painstaking efforts of writers are afraid that it is difficult to compare. But considering manuscript fees together with typesetting costs is always fair and reasonable, not a writer's wishful thinking, right? What is the reality? I know that before the war, typesetting costs were only five or six cents per thousand words, and the most common manuscript fee was three yuan per thousand words, which was about six times the typesetting cost. Now, typesetting costs are more than 80,000 yuan per thousand words (I don't know if it has increased recently), but which bookstore, magazine, or newspaper generally pays 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per thousand words for manuscripts? I know that currently, most manuscript fees are lower than typesetting costs, and there are few that are higher than typesetting costs. It is rare to pay manuscript fees that are twice as high as typesetting costs, "from beginning to end." That is to say, typesetting costs have increased about 40,000 to 50,000 times compared to before the war, while manuscript fees have generally increased only 30,000 to 40,000 times.</p>
<p>So, how many times has the selling price of magazines increased compared to before the war? In fact, it has generally increased 140,000 to 150,000 times, which is exactly the same as the price of typesetting. It is less than white paper (about 300,000 times if 1.5 million is used) but more than manuscript fees. That is to say, writers have a hard life and have to pay for white paper with their hard work.</p>
<p>However, the fate of writers is determined by publishers. If publishers do not intend to despise writers, manuscript fees can at least be increased in proportion to typesetting costs. Of course, in this way, the selling price may have to be increased, and the burden on readers will increase. However, readers should increase this burden, because if they have to increase the burden due to the increase in the price of white paper and typesetting costs, they have an even more unshirkable duty to increase the burden due to the increase in manuscript fees—they originally spent money to read articles.</p>
<p>The current plight of authors with ridiculously low manuscript fees is, to be honest, entirely because publishers simply do not have authors in mind. The best evidence is that every time they increase the selling price, they always say, "This magazine has to increase its price from this issue due to the soaring price of paper (or the sudden increase in printing costs)." They have never said, "This magazine has increased its selling price from this issue because manuscript fees have increased from the previous issue." It seems that articles are simply an insignificant thing for magazines, and authors are either immortals who do not eat earthly food or wealthy people with billions of assets.</p>
<p>But even if the authors are immortals or wealthy people, publishers should do their best to reasonably increase manuscript fees. If the immortals or wealthy people do not want them, they can donate them to refugees. What's more, most authors themselves are refugees.</p>
<p>The current manuscript fees are so ridiculously low that I dare not say that publishers are exploiting authors, but it is undeniable that they are bullying authors—if authors had a trade association like the printing industry and said that they wanted a certain number of yuan per thousand words, otherwise they would not write, I think publishers would only have the "yes, yes" method, right?</p>
<p>Jie Zitui did not speak of emoluments, and emoluments did not come to him. Scholars are ashamed to argue for manuscript fees, and it is not surprising that manuscript fees do not increase because of this. But from now on, the sounds of culture, culture, what, what will be no different from officials taking office for the sake of the country and the people.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child, Jamie, fell into a well near his home. There was very little hope of saving him and preserving his life. The wellhead was only two feet in diameter, and below four feet, the diameter of the circle shrunk to fourteen inches. The surrounding area was sandy soil, and if stirred, it would collapse into a hole. Below twenty-two feet, the wellhead diameter shrank again, leaving only eight inches: only as thick as a bacon pipe. The child had fallen into the narrowest part of the well.</p>
<p>His father shone a flashlight down and only saw the child's head. He wanted to throw a rope down and pull him up, but he was not successful; the child was too young and did not have the strength to hold the rope firmly. He was gradually suffocating to death.</p>
<p>The well was too narrow, and ordinary adults could not go deep after climbing a few feet. It was also inconvenient to dig the well casing, as the sandy soil was too loose. Once it collapsed, it would be like burying the child alive.</p>
<p>A seventeen-year-old youth, Li Liciman, volunteered to go down the well to save the child. He admitted that he was small and could fit into the narrow well casing. He held the child in his arms, with a rope tied around his waist in advance, waiting for the people on the ground to pull him up. Liciman went down for the first time (head first, upside down), and at a depth of fifteen feet, his shoulders and hips were already tightly against the well wall. Light was cut off, he could not see the child at the bottom of the well, and he felt dizzy. Due to the lack of air, he almost suffocated to death. The people on the ground reluctantly pulled him out.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, he tried again. This time, he reached a depth of eighteen feet. He supported himself with his hands, twisting his body, trying to go a few feet further to reach a point where he could grab the child's hand. But before he could get close to the child, he fainted and was lifted up again. On the third attempt, he grabbed the child's wrist. The people waiting above slowly pulled up the rope, and Liciman and the child escaped the cage of the well casing. Liciman felt dizzy, had a headache, and his skin was scraped, but he recovered his strength after a few hours.</p>
<p>This spirit of courageous action immediately received a reward. The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission awarded him a silver medal and $500 in cash. Before awarding the prize, the Carnegie investigator had to investigate the depth and diameter of the well and had to have a report signed and sealed by the rescuers. If they had any doubts about the facts, the investigator had to re-enact the performance of rescuing people from the well, throwing a model child to the bottom of the well and personally going into the well head-down to try it out.</p>
<p>A canoe capsized in Halifax Harbor. At that time, Mrs. McCabe, who was recovering from a recent illness and was still very weak, was standing on the shore, witnessing the tragedy at the prime age of thirty-six. Two teenagers in the canoe were struggling in the water. Mrs. McCabe disregarded everything and waded into the water, swimming close to them. One teenager had already sunk and was unconscious. She dived into the water and grabbed the teenager. At that time, a child on a boat in the harbor also heard the alarm and came to rescue. McCabe dragged him close to the small boat and bravely pushed the unconscious teenager onto the boat. Then she went to rescue another teenager and also pushed him onto the rescue boat. Her arms were numb, and she was exhausted, but she automatically climbed onto the small boat and helped the child carry the two almost drowned teenagers to the shore. The two teenagers were fortunate to be reborn, while she, with her weak body, suffered from the cold and dampness and had to recuperate for a long time before recovering.</p>
<p>The Fund commended Mrs. McCabe's bravery, awarding her a bronze medal and $500 in cash. She could use it to buy some furniture that she urgently wanted to purchase.</p>
<p>The English novelist Thackeray said, "Bravery never goes out of style." This is why the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission considers it their unshirkable duty to commend those who act bravely.</p>
<h3 id="e146">A Flicker That Does Not Extinguish <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>*Crown Magazine* has a column that is often seen but not noticed, called "New Interpretations of Words," which uses a different perspective to interpret a word. For example, for "sofa," their interpretation is: "A chair that is hard to find empty and not sit on." The interpretation of golf is "A game of hitting a small ball into a gap in a big ball that is billions of times bigger than it." This kind of new interpretation, in addition to being particularly insightful, contains elements of wit, sarcasm, and cold laughter—but it seems vulgar as soon as it is said.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was George Bernard Shaw who said that Chinese people do not understand humor (including wit, sarcasm, and cold laughter) very much. I don't remember clearly, but in short, I have heard such a criticism. In fact, if you pay attention, Chinese people really understand the way of wit, sarcasm, and cold laughter. Perhaps our wonderful articles cannot be widely published, and few people are willing to translate them enthusiastically, so that these wonderful texts can spread to the West. Therefore, foreigners believe that Chinese people do not understand humor. Still, look, Chinese people like to look at the author's signature first when reading an article. If it is Lao She or Lao Xiang, that's good, it must be a humorous article, and it must be "words with a meaning within the meaning." Little do they know that Lao She and Lao Xiang also use other pen names to write. Because the signature is not familiar, they look at it and leave. It is also one of the reasons why good articles are placed in front of them but not read and are unknown.</p>
<p>Recently, we saw an example of "New Interpretations of Words"-style humor in action in our city's case of a certain lawyer suing the post office in court for a debt that was too small to be smaller. The reason I don't mention the name of the certain lawyer is not to publicize him, so as to prevent others from associating it with the lawyer's desire to show off, etc. I think this kind of lawsuit, in the eyes of people who study law, is a completely correct action, although the court has already ruled that the certain lawyer lost the case. The loss of this case was inevitable, because the Legislative Yuan had already disputed this matter with the Executive Yuan, and as a result, the postal rate increase passed by the State Council could be implemented without a legislative procedure. Therefore, the failure of the certain lawyer's lawsuit was inevitable. We are not talking about governance, regardless of success or failure. Looking at the actions of the certain lawyer alone, it is simply lovely humor, doing "New Interpretations of Words"-style work on violations of the situation on the *Crown Magazine*! Zhuangzi said: The sun and moon come out, but the flicker does not extinguish. In terms of its prosperity, is it not difficult? Something that ordinary people disdain to do and are unwilling to do is actually done by someone "willing to play a play with a stone mortar on their head," just like the flicker that does not extinguish, bursting out a lively spark in this world that lacks vivid interest.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Method for Cultivating the Mind <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Reading *Tea Leisure Talks* by Ruan Wushan, there is a passage on the method of cultivating the mind that says: "Duke Zhang Wenduan of Tongcheng once said: I have obtained a method in the past five or six years, allowing my body's five senses and hundreds of bones to go through worries, joys, troubles, and hardships. I only guard the square-inch land of my spiritual palace, building it into a city, firmly closing the four gates, not allowing any thoughts of worries, joys, honor, disgrace, advance, retreat, rise, fall, hardship, life, death, gain, or loss to sneak into it. If there is a slight gap, and it enters for a moment, I immediately drive it away, and continue to firmly guard it. As for external sounds and appearances, I only allow them to drift with the waves and belong to the clouds, floating and sinking with worries and joys." This so-called firmly guarding the four gates is the meaning of Mencius's "unmoved mind," which is known to be difficult. According to my notes in *Old Learning Hermitage Notes*, there is also a similar record that says: "My maternal uncle, Zhongjun, was eighty-five or six years old and extremely healthy. He said that he had an epiphany when he was young from reading the *Thousand Character Classic*, namely the four words 'mind moves, spirit tires.' Throughout his life, he never moved his mind when encountering things, so he did not decline in old age." Therefore, Duke Zhang Wenduan's method of cultivating the mind may have originated from the four words "mind moves, spirit tires."</p>

<p>In Chicago, a stockbroker, fell in love with an illiterate young woman. During a hunting trip, the broker proposed to the woman. The broker made special arrangements to send her to school to study, but when the woman had received a considerable education and had learned some social etiquette, the broker changed his mind. The young woman sued him for breach of promise.</p>
<p>"Her lawyer sent a letter requesting a sum of money to compensate for the loss. Paying is okay—but there is one item among them," he complained, "that seems excessive."</p>
<p>"What is this item?" asked a sympathetic friend.</p>
<p>The broker said dejectedly, "She is asking for compensation for the loss of time spent studying to improve her mind—$3,000." (Lei)</p>
<h3 id="e149">Zhu Zhifeng <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>At the end of the [Ming Dynasty], Li Zicheng, a military commander, killed Zhou Ji, the grand coordinator. Subsequently, he attacked Xuanfu, and among those who died for their country was the governor, Zhu Zhifeng. Zhou Xinfang's play, "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," also incorporates the story of Zhu Zhifeng. There is a biography of Zhifeng in the History of Ming, which differs slightly from Zhou Xinfang's version. Xinfang elaborates that he died by slitting his throat, while the History of Ming states that he actually died by hanging himself. Dramatic performances and historical facts do not necessarily have to be completely consistent. The important thing is that Zhu Zhifeng's loyalty and integrity are propagated through the drama, and his virtues are fully expressed. There is no need to quibble over the actual facts. However, the meaning of the name "Zhifeng" is quite puzzling. In Xinfang's play, the character "Feng" is read as "Ping," presumably because he could not find a suitable explanation and simply pronounced it as the "Feng" in "rushing at a tiger without weapons and crossing a river without a boat." However, when I read the biography of Zhu Zhifeng by Governor Wang Zhufu (Yan), it states: "Zhu Zhifeng, whose courtesy name was Dezhi, was a Jinshi in the fifth year of the Tianqi reign. In the early years of the Chongzhen reign, the roving bandits plundered everywhere. The Governor's wife, Madam Feng, died cursing the bandits. The Governor memorialized the Emperor, saying: 'A wife serving her husband is like a subject serving his sovereign. My wife does not betray me, how dare I betray my country? I wish to serve my country as my wife serves our family. I request to change my name to Zhifeng.' It is said that the Governor's original name was Zhiyuan." From this, not only can we correct the mistake of reading "Feng" as "Ping," but we can also understand that the name "Zhifeng" originated from "being grateful for his virtuous wife and changing his name to express his devotion." Therefore, I dare to discuss it here, hoping that those who appreciate drama will understand its origin.</p>
<p>Fengsheng said, "I am not afraid, it doesn't matter." Yunqing said, "Don't be too careless. I think it's better for you to talk to Qihuan, tell her you have the right to cancel the divorce agreement, and declare that you can bind her. Even if she comes to your house in the future, she cannot be treated as the legal wife. It's most reasonable for someone of your status to say these words." Fengqing shook her head and said, "It's meaningless. Stolen sesame cakes don't taste good. I won't do that. Besides, it's beneath my dignity to negotiate with an actress, and it's not worth the effort. I won't do it. I don't think Zhuzhai would do such a foolish thing either." Yunqing was very disappointed that she couldn't persuade Fengsheng. After a while, she said again, "You can call Zhuzhai over and ask him if this is true." Fengsheng said, "Why should I ask him? Would he tell me? I'll just see what happens!" Yunxiang saw that she firmly refused and knew it was useless to say more, so she said, "I'm just telling you not to be careless about this. If he succeeds, it will be difficult for you to deal with." Fengsheng said, "I'm not afraid. Anyway, I'm going all out, I'm not afraid of anything. Even if Zhuqi is willing to come back, I don't think it's useful. In short, my relationship with him is not good. What's the point of living together!" Yunqing saw that she was so resolute, so she said, "I came specifically to tell you this news today. If you think you have it under control, I don't need to worry about you!" Fengsheng said, "Thank you. As long as he doesn't short me on my monthly living expenses, I won't trouble him." Yunqing said, "Maybe the thirty million yuan he gave you this time was allocated from Qihuan's hand." Fengsheng said, "I don't care about that. As long as it's given to me by him, it's his money, and I have no responsibility for how I spend it." Yunqing saw that she was so nonchalant and knew that she couldn't be utilized. After chatting for a while, she went home. When she got home, she thought about this matter carefully and felt that if Zhuzhai continued to meddle, by the time the matter was a foregone conclusion, there would be no way to solve it. Even if Zhuzhai's family opposed it, it would only cause a family conflict. It might even incite Zhuzhai to take Qihuan to the south. Zhuzhai often said that he had no prospects in Beiping and had long intended to go south. If this really prompted him to go south, it would be fulfilling their wishes. The only regret was that in a moment of excitement, she had pushed Fengsheng and Zhuzhai to divorce, never expecting such a big mistake. Yunqing had the most meticulous mind and was usually the most strategic, but today, no matter how much she thought, she couldn't come up with a clever solution, which made her restless and unable to eat. Old Mrs. Zhang saw this and knew that she was upset about Zhuzhai's matter. She wanted to tell Zhuzhai's father, Xu Yuru, several times, but Yunqing strongly stopped her, saying that even if Yuru knew, it would only create more family entanglements. If the two of them were still determined, they would eventually get together.</p>
