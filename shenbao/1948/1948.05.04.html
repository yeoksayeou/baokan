<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕中美兩國政府今日同意於南京及華盛頓同時公布美國務卿馬歇爾及我駐美大使顧維鈞於今年四月卅日換文全文。我國於換文中同意美方以「建議」方式所提出援華各項條件，我政附同意由美國派遺一經濟合作代表團來華、惟聲明我國政府瞭解來照所述之建議，不能視為構成美政府「有對本國援助之義務」。於是項換文中，我政府表示贊同美援華之宗旨及政策，又換文中雙方並同意援華法案第四〇四節（甲）款所核准之資金，「除關於建設計劃者外，將以贈與方式」供給中國。又美國一九四八年援法案已於四月三日成爲法律，至於中美政府依照該法案第四〇五節所規定之雙邊協定，則尙待談判。換在全文如次：</p>
<p>馬卿致顧使照會</p>
<p>美利堅合衆國國務卿致中華民國駐美大使照會：逕啓者，一九四八年援華法案（一九四八年援外法案第四部）已於一九四八年四月三日成爲法律，茲將關於援華件案之建議，照達如下：美國政府提議在依照一九四八年美國援外法案第四〇五節所規定之中美協定未訂立以前，至一九四八年七月止，決定辦法，以執行該法案所授權之各項任務，此等任務之爲促進該法案之宗旨，而適用該法案第四〇四節（甲款核准之資金所認爲必需者。美國政府此項行動，當視下列若干條件之履行而定。該法案之授權供給援助，乃爲促進第四〇二節所列之宗旨與政策，貴國政府對於此等宗旨與政策，是否贊同。又貴國政府是否有意依照該法案第四〇五節之規定，與美國訂立協定，如蒙惠予通知本國務卿，當深感荷。在此項協定未訂立以前，本國政府提議依該法案第四〇四節（甲）款所授權之對華援助應暫受一九四七年十月廿七日貴我兩國政府所訂協定之支配，但鑒於該法案之援助與一九四七年十月二十七日協定之救濟援助性質不同，貴我兩國政府今後得經同意，予以變通，尤其關於援助之種類及採購與分配之條件與方法，並受下列論解之限制而作爲初步辦法。茲可預期者，在本照會所述之時期內，以依照該法案第四〇四節（甲）款所核准之資金所作之援助，除關於建設計劃者外，將以贈與方式供給貴國政府。關於建設援助之資金，如須償還時，其條件留待日後決定。本國務卿提議在依照該法案第四〇五節所規定貴我兩國政府訂立協定之條款未決定以前，對於所定供給之任何援助，經本國政府指定爲贈與者，應即依照一九四七年十月二十七日貴我兩國政府所訂協定之規定，以貴國貨幣劃撥存款。本國務卿又提議此項存款，可用以支付本國政府在貴國推行一九四八年援華法案所需貴國貨幣之行政費用，及貴我兩國政府所同意之其他用途。將來貴我兩國政府所訂協定，關於任何中國貨幣存款之規定，對於本照會所述時期內決定以贈與方式所作對貴國政府之此項援助，應予適用。本國務卿深信貴國政府對於上述諒解，能予同意。該法案授權本國政府派遺一經濟合作代表團前往貴國，倘蒙貴國政府惠予保證，對於推行實施該法案之本國政府代表將予充分合作，實深感荷。本國務卿深信貴國政府瞭解本照會所述之建議不能視爲構成本國政府有對貴國援助之義務，本國務卿順向貴大使重表敬意。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美國前駐蘇大使蒲立特，再度來華訪問，已於昨日下午四時一刻乘泛美航空公司機抵滬。前往龍華機塲歡迎者甚衆，計有甫自美國返國之貝祖詒，吳市長代表張彼德，中央銀行副總裁劉攻芸，交通銀行總經理趙棣華，中國銀行國外部總理陳長桐，美新聞處康納士，新聞局魏景蒙，以及美總領事，美商會，曁我國金融界代表共數十人。滿氏在機塲向記者表示，渠此次來華純係私人訪問性質。對於外傳將爲美援華計劃執行人一點，蒲氏堅決否認，謂渠與此事絕無關係，僅稱：「余將在華逗留一月，約於六月初旬返美。此次擬幷訪在華友人並願獲悉自余去年九月離華以來中國之情形。」記者復詢以渠對於中國情形所欲知者爲何一方面，經濟政治抑或軍事？蒲氏笑答：「余對於中國任何方面情形均感興趣，因余喜歡中國並愛中國人民。」關於蒲氏在華訪問地區，渠尙未決定；渠定於今晨乘美軍用機晋京。抵京後，渠將謁見蔣主席天婦及各友好，蓋其在京友人甚多，至留京日期現亦未定。據悉，蒲氏並將赴華北各地考察。昨日蒲氏抵滬後即寓貝祖詒寓邸，六時許赴美總領事葛柏德之鷄尾酒會，席間並與吳市長等會晤。晚間即在貝府進養。又據有關方面悉，貝氏將陪同蒲氏晋京，故雖經蒲本人一再聲明與援華事無關，然外界揣測仍認爲蒲氏將爲援華計劃之負責人，惟因尙未到發表時期，故官方不予證實。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕貝祖詒氏昨晨由京抵滬，任務爲迎迓因洽商運用美援物資而來華之蒲立特氏。據央行某高級人員稱：貝氏與蒲立特晤面後，即伴送蒲氏晋京，將來貝氏頗有可能祖任我國運用美援機構之主持人。此機構採取委員會之形式，直隸於行政院，農，經，財，糧四部部長及央行總裁等有關官員，均將被任命為委員。</p>

<h3 id="c19">科學·民主·與理性　—為紀念「五四」而作 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>今天是五月四日，是民國八年學生界發動而全國教育界工商界共同參加迫使軍閥政府罷黜曹陸章的愛國運動紀念日。時光不啻電波，當年北平參加示威的少年，至今多已鬢毛如霜，五四到今年已是第三十年頭了。</p>
<p>五四誠然由學生界與熱烈贊助的敎育界爲導率，但響應遍於社會各階曆，而其影響又及於政治經濟文化各方面。我們住上海稍久的人，都想像得起當時上海工商界反對廿一條件與罷免彫國訂約者的熱烈，—這正是代表外侮壓迫與軍閥亂政下的民族的與民權的自覺。此後工商學與社會風氣的轉移，都受它的廣泛的影響。所以所謂五四運動，我們應認爲一種廣泛的社會運動文化運動，而不只是狹義的靑年運動。</p>
<p>由五四反日侵略以至於抗日戰鬥的勝利，中國對外經過了多少痛楚辛酸，而民族地位還是外强內弱；由五四提倡中國社會與政治改造以至於今日憲法制頒，新選總統，中國內政經過了多少艱難迂迴，而憲治的規模還只初奠。這眞足令我們發生無窮的感慨，而觸發我們鑒往知來，檢討得失的動機。</p>
<p>五四對中國學生對中國社會風氣有解放推動之功，可是也不乏不良的影響。二十餘年來，討論五四運動的功罪之論議眞是太多了，此刻已不煩我們多說。我們只不能忘記五四時代所揭的兩大指路標：—是科學，是民治。所謂「賽先生」與「德先生」，在當時不但爲社會上流行語，也是輿論界立論的繩尺，是一切有志人士理想的　的。我們認五四爲全國性的社會文化運動，所以我們就得看三十年後的今日中國，這二件法　演進到怎樣程度，以及我們在此二方面的得失與應有的補救之方，以爲我們今後努力的準據。</p>
<p>先說科學。我們翻閱民國八年至十年前後的報刋，到處是提倡科學的文章；可是這五六年的中國科學實質的進步，遠不及十六年以後，而文藝的創造倒是一時的寵兒。這象徵了當時的提倡科學只是科學通論，粗淺的科學方法，與表面的科學風氣，而不是科學實驗，專門的科學研究，與實際的科學精神。清李所見的洋學是「科學的奇與」，五四所憧憬的是「科學的神聖」，而我們實際需要的應該是「科學的遲用」，或說是全民的科學的洗禮。這不澈底的尊敬科學，當然為中國科學行進做了淸道廓淸的工夫，可是實際科學研究工夫却躭誤了時光。這錯誤一由於當時的模仿性的急功心理，二由了早熟性的世界和平理想。前者使我們輕信只要充分吸收就自然進步，後者使我們暫時拋去了民族的「竹槓」，而漢視了科學國防的建立。十餘年的時間，在革命與外患中輕易錯過，待至蘆溝砲聲擴爲民族抗戰，日本所書藉的侵略武力是科學化裝備，而我們的科學與科學家可以效勞於作戰的還只相仿於五四時代的程度。我們當局只有忍痛標出「以空間爭時間」的策略，而我們的軍民更只有苦楚地喊出「以血肉築長城」的呼聲。這敎訓眞是太殘酷，也太深刻了！　今以後，我們必須痛懲前失，以實際的科舉硏究工作來代替科學運動的提倡。新中國的科學硏討必須是一種民族的實際的行動，嚴肅的工作。我們的政府與工商界都應有此認識，以求知爲天職的智議靑年，更必須有此痛澈的贊悟，不能再將「科學」視同口號與觀念，在因循與浮動中躭誤了自己與祖團了！</p>
<p>次說民主。五四時代所標揭的民治，在對軍閥亂政與專制殘餘風氣的摧陷廓淸上確已下了不少的工夫，發生廣泛的深入社會的影響。可是與科學一樣，—讓我們採用佛家習用而很蘭明的名詞，—當時所做的是「破」多于「立」，推破了反民主的渣滓而未會眞正迎進了民主的信念，更談不到民主制度的策劃。五四時代先覺的靑年與敎育家受歐美民主政治的影響，對民主富有信慕之心，而未嘗從本身與社會上實做適應民主生活的工夫。及至政治革命的演進，由於軍事的力量，當然也有不少智識靑年的參加，推翻了軍閥，依據國父遺敎以建立訓政，從事準備憲政。十餘年中，政府未能充分發揮民主精神，還有許多內在外在的原因，可是我們的社會進步，更是不能配合政治的行進。我們的敎育程度與觀念，不能產生健全的地方自治人員，不能造成普徧的守法習慣，不能發揮輿論制裁的力量，也不易選出絕大多數都能具有「容忍異見」和「服從多數」等基本素養的國民代表。這自然由於多年的各方面的因素，可是五四當時也種下一種根本的錯誤，就是：當時不曾探得造成近代民主政治的眞正根源，民衆的公民敎育與守法精神。現在我們已踏入憲政的階段，可是我們不能否認目前的國民敎育還是不能配合憲政的需要，而應懲鑑前失，加緊的從社會基層痛下補救工夫。我們要督責政治監進，根餘貪汚與因循；但必須人民有智有能以監督政府，而後不能的政治始得奠立。眞正的廣義的民主是一種生活態度與文化模式。必須在民主風度的社會文化與生活之上，才眞能產生一個民主的政府。</p>
<p>科學與民主，在中國是五四時代開始抬起了頭，可是沒有豐富的肥料爲之培育滋長；甚至十幾年中，我們長久逗留在消極的摧破反科舉反民主而效果還未顯著的階段中，而未能在廣大社會上在學術文化上種下積極樹立科學硏究與民主風範的基礎。這基本原因是什麽？我們以爲由於國人大家還未知重視現代國家的基本精神，——理性。五四時代並非不重觀理性，而事實則當時一切活動的動力，是感情的奔放超過理知的培養。靑年如此，中年如此，整個社會多是如此。一種運動，當然省不來熱烈的眞誠的感情，可是更需要濟以冷靜的堅實的理性。我們崇拜科學，我們不曾由理智來接受「愛知〕的精神，從事踏寬的專門硏究。我們仰慕民主，我們又不曾由理知來接受政治的素養，來增進了解政治與改進政治的能力。直至今日，在靑年方面所表現的，依然不少被意氣感情支配了行動。戡亂軍事與經濟艱難增加了社會的不安，造成了怨望責難的風氣，這風氣田中年影響靑年，而不幸未能通過「理知」的考量與醉化。五四的熱情是過去了，五四時代所缺乏的理性在今日還是未能發揚光大以補充其未逮。這不能不說中國科學進步與憲政實現的根本之夏憂！</p>
<p>保持五四的眞正優良傳統，熱烈的感情　邁往的朝氣，提高理性的運用以補充光大五四的精神，來策進中國科學與憲政的進步；這是新中國的根本需要，也應是我們全國靑年與各界同胞努力的基準。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美國「信不信由你」漫畫作者李伯蘭來華搜集題材，於昨日上午乘克利扶蘭總統輸抵滬，住於華懋飯店。</p>
<p>李伯蘭係「信不信由你」漫畫創造者，他筆下所畫的希奇古怪的事物風靡全球，有三十八個國家，三百二十六張報紙，以十七種不同的文字轉載他的作品，每天欣賞他漫畫的讀者估計在七千萬人以上。</p>
<p>「信不信由你」漫畫作者李伯蘭（本報攝）</p>
<p>成名經過</p>
<p>李伯蘭畫「信不信由你」已有三十四年歷史，從無一天間斷。他的成名作是一則畫飛行家林白上校飛渡大西洋的故事。大家都知道林白是那越大西洋的第一人，但他的漫畫裏却說：「林白是中途不停留而飛越大西洋的第六十七人」。事實上他是對的，因爲林白雖是發起而完成第一次飛越大西洋的英雄，但在他那次飛越的行列中，却共有兩架飛機與兩艘飛艇，他自己駕駛最後一架飛機，前面的一架飛機與兩艘飛艇中正好坐着六十六人。</p>
<p>酷愛遊歷</p>
<p>例如這一類出奇的事實，李伯蘭都是化了許多心力搜集的。他本人酷愛遊歷，英遜王溫莎公爵曾稱他爲「現代馬哥波羅」。全世界偏僻的角落幾乎都有他的足跡，所見所聞種種新奇事物，成了他筆下的好材料。除此之外，世界各地的讀者紛紛投稿給他，每年他收到的信件達數萬封之多。爲整理這些材料，他僱用大批職員，從事考證工作，以探討這些奇事怪物是否有根據，而決定取捨。凡是經他採用的材料，其稿費視內容的價値而定，普通每一則約爲美金五元。</p>
<p>出身貧苦</p>
<p>像他筆下的奇事怪物一樣，李伯蘭本身也是奇人。他今年五十六歲，却還是一個獨身者。他健康極佳，從來不吸烟，從來不玩撲克牌。畫起漫畫來是顛倒畫上去的。他出身窮苦，父親是一個木匠，在他十二歲時就去世。他小時候替人家拾網球，賺錢貼補家用。後來以他的天才畫畫招貼，進而爲一家報館盡體育漫畫。他的第一張「信不信由你」是在無意中贊成，刋出後居然大受讀者歡迎，從此就逐漸成名。</p>
<h3 id="c77">我國讀者踴躍投稿 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>這一次他到東方來搜集題材，　　馬尼刺香港到上海，三天後就要飛東京。他的「信不信由你漫晝，本市英文大陸報有轉載。自從他要來滬的消息發表後，已有不少中國讀者投稿到大陸報轉交給他。這些稿件中有最近各報所記載重慶發現的九年不食「仙姑」，有奧深莫測的數學圖解，有圖文並茂的說文解字。有一封信內附了一張五千元鈔票，投稿者說這張鈔票是在某一天簽字後用出，一年後的同一天又回到了自已手裏。更有一對信內很簡單的寫這樣一句：「大陸報是中國僅有的登戟李伯蘭漫盡的報紙」李伯　昨天捧了一大堆這類信件給記者看，他笑着說還來不及仔細看呢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕在中程登陸艇上，許多穿着象徵「白山黑水」的樸素制服的人羣裏，找到參加過三次全運，創造過百米十秒七全國記錄的短跑名將劉長春，快八年了，幾莖白髮，使他哨然而嘆：「我今年已經卅九歲了。」</p>
<p>幾年來，他在潘陽的中正大學裏敎體育，這次是以總管理的名義，率領大軍南征。我很希望他能說出些奇蹟，或是在他的訓練和陶冶下，東北會有一個至少與「十秒七」能够並駕齊驅的高已出現。但却引來了他滿腹感慨：「這是不能和戰前來比較的」，他說：「勝利以後，東北局勢一直在緊張中，練起來情緒上就打了一個極大的折扣，就百米來說，只能有十一秒四·五的成績。」</p>
<p>冰天雪地，尤其限制了東北健兒的馳騁，劉長春說：「當我們離開東北的時候，地上才開始溶化，草木也剛發芽，所以一直沒機會對我們的選手在實力上有一個衡量，或成績上有一個準確的記錄。」他謙遜地表示此來是絲毫沒有奪標的雄心，也沒有把握。在動身前一週，他們還沒有決定，爲來爲去是錢的問題，他這樣對記者說：「雖然經費不够，可是大家多感到非來不可，所以這次來的作用，還是着重在精神上，因爲我們實在沒有可以向人眩耀的成績。</p>
<p>經過記者再三請求，他稍微透露了一點在他認爲比較可以拿得出的項目，李令會龍的八百米，成績二分四秒，中欄五十七秒七，和全國記錄二分二·二秒及五十八·三秒還算接近。其次是郭建章的鐵餅有三十八·五米，十六磅鉛球十二·三米。</p>
<p>這些都不足爲憑，誠如許多人的期待一樣，我們將會爲冷門獨出而驚詫，鼓舞！</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕六屆全運時的足球錦標大會戰，曾經風靡過數十萬中外球迷，尤其是香港，馬華，廣東，上海這四强的搏鬥，更給與觀衆們不知多少緊張驚險的懷念。十三年了，如今四雄隊幟，舊地重逢，可以說仇人相見，分外眼紅，當然又少不了一塲惡鬥。本屆和上屆相較，魯，皖，平，湘，贛，冀，和靑海，遼寗八隊未來，却加上了貴州，大連，暹羅，漢口，菲列賓，以及五軍共九隊。講聲勢，實在比上屆浩大；說陣容，配置也極爲整齊；談人才，雖然世運隊抽去不少精銳，但廿一隊人馬中，仍多的是宿將新人，何况四强五軍，難得碰頭，此番短兵相接，怎會不精彩紛呈？</p>
<p>廿一隊大軍，有很多從未在上海漏過臉，在這裏不妨先來觀察一遍：</p>
<p>四川隊全隊十四人，幾乎全是在成都選拔出來的，其中包括華西大學六人，省體專二人，川大二人，公務員三人，外縣參加的祗有一人。因爲組隊未久，無暇練習，便開拔來滬，聯絡自難如理想，後衛綫尤某是較弱的一環。前鋒配置稍見堅强，右內鋒陳明道在個人技術上更可稱爲雋才，長挑短傳，射門衝搏，兩俱佳妙，獨惜合作乏人，美中不足，否則以攻作守，還可聊補後方弱點。門守奚兆龍尙稱穩健，係省體專上選之材，將來初戰遭逢警察時，是否能維持一安定局面，則端視他如何發揮左擋右架的解數了。</p>
<p>河南隊的應戰陣容已經排定：</p>
<p>王天祥　劉民生</p>
<p>張濟民　關新友</p>
<p>嚴紹祖　柴居振　楊西山</p>
<p>袁山　單毅網　程鵬騫　章矩曾　郭世昌</p>
<p>該隊正和四川一樣，選拔僅限於開封一地，所以全隊十七人中，學生竟達十三人，豫大十，開師三，業餘僅佔四人。以學生組隊，優點在行動矯捷，體力有餘，但缺點則經騐較淺，技術不足。該隊大部隊員，都曾參加過在漢口舉行的華中運動會，戰勝數塲，結果負於湖南，當時單毅網衝鋒陷陣，柴居振前後呼應，迅速的短傳，着實博得不少讚譽，由此可見非體力佔優，決不克臻此。這次該隊首戰即遇勁敵廣東，撇開勝負不談，單看這羣來自中州的靑年健兒，在奔馳追逐中所表現出來的體力，已够使我們嚮往不置了。</p>
<p>貴州隊可以說是本屆全運足球隊中精　最好的一隊，全隊十五人中，省府秘畫長薛文繍親任隊長並自兼中鋒，統率三軍，貴州第四警察分局長羅世騏護特聯絡綫，鎭守中樞，單看這兩尊銜頭，你就可想像到這一隊的精神蓬勃到怎樣一個程度！該隊隊員有學生，有公務員，有商人，也有市民，完全是一支雜牌軍。但職務的紛歧，並不影響他們對自己精神的信任。當他們知道在初戰時即將碰着勁旅陸軍或靑島之後，就表示勝負決置諸度外，作戰過程中，不怯塲，不畏縮，始終如一，賣力到底。</p>
<p>漢口隊的實力，相當堅朗而平均。主將張德江爲華北足球名宿，中衛綫程瑞雲，楊雙貴是名震武漢的球壞二傑，後衛有平漢隊名將孫順祥負任艱巨，門守則由漢市籃球選手葉濤兼充。該隊係以平漢隊八人爲基幹，空軍二人，學生二人所組成，平漢隊八人都曾在鄂省若干次足球的大小戰役中出過風頭，其中尤以程，楊，孫爲佼佼者。該隊病在門守稍弱，但將來可得力於中後衛綫的帮忙。漢市足球好手本多，這次却因漢市，鄂省，聯勤三單位各自拉攏而分散，一幕重頭好戲，就此化整爲零。該隊這次首戰對空軍，兩强遭遇，鏖戰必不可免。將來該隊如有進取，則端賴張德江指揮下的五鋒如何聯繫和迫遞，該隊如克堅守，則當視程，楊，孫，三人如何截擊及呼應了</p>

<p>大會第一日開幕典禮，本市市民前征參加者，必萬人空巷，如何購票入場，頗爲一班士女關心。據大會票務組方面消息，大會已向郵局借得郵亭十座，分佈會塲四週，作爲售票亭，此方形之票亭，四面皆窗，每次有四人可同時購票，十座票亭，即有四十售票處，屆時購票當可不致如何困難，且此四十名售票員皆爲女子，可免一切把持操縱門票等流弊云。第一日揭幕典禮門券分二十萬元及五萬元兩種。</p>

<p>粵穗選于說：「在廣東，已是換季的時候了，不料到了上海，下機時看見許多人還穿着大衣，警訝不已。果然，冷風一吹，毛骨悚然，所以有好多個選手們都傷風了」。</p>
<p>四川雀的領隊文豐先生說：他們比較有希望的幾項迎動，是鉛球和女子五十米，他如足球等個人技術都很高明，虎是聯絡欠佳。他們挑選運動員的標準，是照上屆全運的紀錄徑賽以前三名爲限，田賽則以前六名爲準。參加國術的選手，更是出類拔萃，由全省最佳的八名中挑出優秀者二位。全體選手廿五人中：華西大學的有八位，三位是川大的，體專有二位，其他的還有省府的敎育廳科長等等。</p>
<p>貴州女選手，昨日下午四時，從尙廉肅搬至大敎堂，每人手提行李兩大捆：有的從容不迫，有的汗流滿面，原來一些是三鐵健將，一些只是籃球能手。</p>
<p>漢口市選手們，大嘆苦經，謂大會招待太使人失望，加之自己經費不足，上海物價又貴，故大部份選手深居簡出，貴州選手們只作如是觀，大宿舍內臥榻橫陳，鼾聲此起彼伏。</p>
<p>新疆選手們每人紅帽子一頂，註册商標，遠處一望即可鑑定。</p>
<p>歷任前三屆全運之廣東代表總領隊金曾澄，年已耆耄，近日參加國代後來滬，渠稱：「本屆全運，難有優良成績，亦在意料中。雖然，吾仍力勉各選手也」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕參加此次全運之吉林省代表，除王永芳·張浦二人，已於日前抵滬，及總領隊王士楨，代表王福海，王士德，王福林，齊寶珠，等五人，將於今日來滬外，昨（三日）下午六時，該省代表何佩，單永禮，王鈞，等三人，已乘中航機自平飛抵本市。記者在機塲晤及，渠等面龐均呈黝黑憔悴，頭髮蓬亂，若不勝萎頓疲憊者。據語記者稱：「余等三人係於四月十七日離長春，一路喬裝難民，循中長鐵路徒步南下，穿越匪佔領區時，歷盡艱辛，飽嚐痛苦，有非楮墨所能形容。越十日，至廿六日始行抵瀋陽，但已鞋穿足破，無復人形，然斯時所感得之安慰愉快，固已遠過於所遭痛苦矣」。東北同胞此種固有精神及毅力之發揮，誠爲本屆大會中最堪紀念之一個可歌可泣之片段。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕昨天下午，中青溫水游泳池，變了浪裏白條們的世界。全國第一流男女好手，幾乎一池打盡。</p>
<p>點點看，上海，菲律賓，粵穗，台灣……以及實力最堅强的香港隊，都來了。</p>
<p>看台上，人頭擠擠。池子邊，人言嘖嘖。大家聚精會神，你看我姿勢，我窺你實力。無他，滿想知己知彼，百戰百勝而已。</p>
<p>菲律賓的五員健將來得較早，他們在池裏翻來覆去練習自由式，仰泳俯泳等幾樣，都是他們的拿手，成績也彪炳得很。</p>
<p>祗是，他們覺得上海水溫和，天氣都太冷了。菲律賓一般游泳池經常的水溫，總在九十五度左右。中靑的溫水池，還祗七十度有零。</p>
<p>本屆大會游泳池的水溫，照常例推測，當不會高過中靑的水溫，因此他們惶恐成績會不如理想。</p>
<p>翻翻菲律賓華僑八年前所創造的游泳最高紀錄，自由式五十米廿七秒八，一百米六十二秒，四百米五分卅二秒，百米仰泳一分十九秒，二百米俯泳二分五十八秒，幾乎每項都可打破全國紀錄。</p>
<p>三點光景，粵穗隊來了，香港大隊人馬也接着趕到，游泳房裏，頓時熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>碰到香港領隊潘永楷，管理黃少雄，說起香港奪標的事，他們都虛懷若谷，連說：「不見得！不見得」！</p>
<p>池子裏，最逗人注目的，有粵穗和香港的兩對姊妹花。粵穗姊妹花名鄭燕瑛，鄭雪瑛，香港姊妹花名黃婉貞，黃婉生。</p>
<p>粵穗鄭氏姊妹，燕瑛十四歲，雪瑛十三歲。看上去，都是不滿五尺的稚子，才從去年八月起練，今年參加選拔賽，居然一鳴驚人！</p>
<p>燕瑛百米仰泳一分五十四秒，雪瑛二百米胸泳三分四十九秒，四百米自由式八分三十二秒，幼年稚子，經短期訓練而有此超人成績，寗非奇跡！</p>
<p>鄭氏姊妹是廣東鹽步鄉人，她們家鄉住宅對門，有條小浜，就在這條小浜裏，經過她們父親的循循善誘，替粵穗隊製造了出席本屆全運僅有的二位女游泳代表。</p>
<p>她們的家鄉，離廣州還相當遠。她們的父親，是做爆竹業的。但發現了女兒的天才後，就趕緊訓練，又趕送到廣州參加選拔，結果如願以償。</p>
<p>她們一家三姊妹，小妹妹才十二歲，也在浜裏翻呀翻的，下屆全運，粵穗隊準又多一位女游泳健將。</p>
<p>在中靑看過她們練習游泳的名將徐亨說：鄭氏姊妹，無論從姿勢，速率，年事等各方面來說，前途眞是了不起的。</p>
<p>香港黃氏姊妹，年齒，體態，舉止，都較鄭氏姊妹成熟多了。婉貞十八歲，婉生十四歲，長來亭亭玉立，輕盈矯捷，水汪在的眸子，略陷而帶光，有些西方人風味。</p>
<p>昨天中午，她倆才跟着媽媽何佳侶，坐克利夫蘭總統輪抵埠。才下碼頭，就跟着媽媽上中靑練習，不放鬆半絲半縷的時間。</p>
<p>何佳侶是香港女子游泳隊的領隊，她對兩個孩子的成績，歸功於孩子爸爸的訓練不懈。據說：她們不但實地練習，還時時根據世界各國游泳技術的專著，作科學化的研究。</p>
<p>告訴你幾檔最高紀錄，婉貞的自由式五十米卅五秒一二，百公尺八十一秒，婉生的二百米俯泳三分卅七秒，看來這次的全國紀錄，要被全盤揭破了！</p>
<p>原來，她們的家，就在香港的海灘邊，環境得天獨厚。</p>
<p>她倆在去年四月間，才正式加入香港勵進隊練習，過去一向沒沒無聞。去年十月間，在兩廣水災賑濟賽會上，創造了幾項全國紀錄，兩顆新彗星，終於被發掘出來了。</p>
<p>黃氏姊妹，都在香港聖士提反女書院念書。婉貞讀高中二，婉生讀初中一。</p>
<p>臨走，同佳侶說：小孩子年事尙輕，還不是稱譽煊染的時候，希望大家多多指敎督導，以便知所警惕。</p>
<p>看了鄭黃兩對姊妹花的崛起南國，不由使人追憶起六屆全運時叱咤風雲的楊秀琼楊秀珍姊妹。長江後浪推前浪，畢竟今人勝古人，可喜亦復可歎！</p>
<p>香港隊虎將劉帝柄，蔡利恒，陳震南等，都在池裏駢肩往返，游泳。全體自由式，三人渦處，但見白浪滾滾，活像三條高速度的蚊子艇。</p>
<p>短距離泳後起之秀的劉帝柄，這次抱着打破紀錄的雄心，參加全運。看他划水大刀闊斧，雙足節拍有序，換氣也恰到好處，一切淸晣美觀，這雄心是有希望實現的。</p>
<p>中距離泳老將陳震南，心曠體胖，縱橫泳壇十餘年，而精力不衰，本屆的自由式四百米千五百米兩項，非陳莫屬，紀錄也可刷新。</p>
<p>陳震南在香港所保持的渡海紀錄，迄未被人打破。</p>
<p>粵穗選手對大會所排的水球秩序，感覺不公平。第一天滬對菲，空對穗兩塲的勝利隊，第二天才能分別跟香港馬華打。港馬佔了便宜，而　菲空穗就吃了虧。</p>

<h3 id="c123">或然能替代真理嗎 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 洪謙</p>
<p>（一）或然替代真理的理論根據</p>
<p>自從現代物理學廣泛的應用或然（Probability）概念以後，在哲學上對于眞理問題，就產生了新的問題。現在對于眞理所產生的新的問題，自然不在于眞理的存在或不存在的玄學思辯，而在于我們能否應用或然的槪念以替代眞理的槪念，能否用「多的或然」和「少的或然」以表達實際事物的眞理性。德國哲學家H.Reichenbach（以下簡稱爲R）不是肯定的說過嗎：我們之所謂眞理，事實上全是或然，就是所謂錯誤，也全是或然，「多的或然」就是某種事物的眞理，「少的或然」，就是某種事物的錯誤。眞理一詞是邏輯上一個冬餘的概念，只有或然才堪稱爲人類知識的基本槪念和理論根據了。</p>
<p>R的眞理觀念，甚能代表當代若干科學家的意見。因爲他們之所以否定眞理爲人類知識的基本槪念，並擬代以或然概念的主要理由，就在于現代物理學一方面己放棄因果律原則之爲科學的知織標準，另一面復應用所謂統計律以建立現代科學的理論根據，R等認爲哲學上所謂絕對眞理，雖然在哲學上有其奇妙的玄學理論，但是在科學中唯一能解樣的，只在于因果律原則之能爲古典科學的理論基礎，之能有其實際的普遍性而已。現在因果律旣因現代物理學之成立而失効，那麼這樣的眞理觀念，自然應隨之而改變了。</p>
<p>（二）統計律不是數學的「或然律」</p>
<p>R等這樣對于眞理的看法，表面上好似有其理由，有其根據，但是實際上是完全錯誤的。他們之所以有如此錯誤之點，第一是應歸咎于他們對于統計律與「或然律」的本質無精確的認識；第二對于或然命題與實際上的眞僞命題的邏輯意義無充分的了解。所以認爲統計律可以取消因果律，成然命題能替代眞偽的命題的了。</p>
<p>我們認爲R等把有關於第一點的錯誤的理山，即因統計律實際上並不是如R等所謂一種數學的「或然律」，而是一種「不　確的因果律」。這一點我們如將因果律和統計律的不同點加以分析就不難明白了。關於因果律之有異於統計律之點，我們在原則上可以說：前者是對於某些實際事件的個別關係有所叙述，有所推論，後者則只能對於某些實際事件的集體關係有所叙述，有所推論。譬如我們能從事物所受的壓力而推論到其應起的抗力，我們亦能從水的一定的熱度而推論到其沸漲的程度。這都是爲因果律所支配的物理現象。但是爲統計律所支配的物理現象，則不是這樣的了。這樣的物理現象，譬如我們用開始應用統計律的甲司理論來說：我們對於集體的分子活動能用精確的因果法則，爲之叙述，但是在某個集體的分子以內的分子的分佈狀態，則是無法繩之以律的。又如在Schroedinger的量子力學中」波浪的放射部分，仍爲集體性的因果關係所支配的，不過在　波浪放射的集體以內的質子與量子的活動情形，則完全出於偶然出於混亂的了，因其如此，所以有些科學家稱因果律爲一種具了「精確的因果法則」的自然律，統計律則爲一種具了「不精確的因果法則」的自然律。</p>
<p>不過假如我們同意R等的主張，不將統計律視爲一種「不精確的因果律」，而視爲一種數學的「或然律」，那麼結果連將統計律之爲自然律的可能性，都被否定了。我們這裏對於或然槪念在實際上的，應用問題，且不必談，我們必須說明的；就是統計律之爲一種關於實際的律，是因其亦有可成律之點（譬如在甲司理論中所謂集體的分子活動），並不是根據純粹的或然成分（譬如在上述理論中的集體分子以內的分子分佈狀態）所能建立的，從純粹的或然成分建立所謂「或然律」在數學中雖不成其為問題，但是在實際上則並無其可能性。譬如我們以ABCD代表若干實際事件來說吧，我們根據多次而反覆的觀察結果，旣不能求出其個別的相互的因果關係，亦不能從某種百分率上以證明其集體性的法則。在如此情形之下，我們只能說這些事件的發生，旣不是屬於因果律的，亦不是屬於統計律的，究全是無律可言的，是出於偶然出於混亂的。</p>
<p>但是對於這樣偶然的不爲任何律則所支配的ABCD的事件（譬如以擲骸子爲喩吧），從數學方面來看，則就根本不同的。在數學中如或然數學指示我們：無論如何無律則性和偶然的事件，我們亦能設法用所謂「或然律」解釋的。我們只要將ABCD事件所得的多次而反覆的觀察結果，首先用數學的交換法排成行列，而後再平均的確定其在整個數額內的「相對次數」，而後再從中假定這個「相對次數」的應用法則，自然我們這裏所擬定的整個數額，總比所想像的觀察總數爲小的，這一點在數學中用表達「觀察的總數超越一切界限而生長」的Limse一詞假定了。</p>
<p>從上面的兩個說明中我們想已能明白，「或然律」在數學中可能之點以及在實際上不可能之點，在數學中我們對於純粹偶然的事件亦能以律的形式爲之解釋。這就是「或然律」的任務和作用，這就是或然數學的對象和目的。但是在實際上我們對於實際的事件只能有兩種的說法：稱一種爲一定的自然法則所支配的事件，爲右律則性的，稱一種不爲任何自然法則所支配的事件，爲偶然的。我們總不能稱有律則性的事件，爲偶然的吧？總不能稱偶然的事件爲有律則性的吧？R等因爲沒有看到這一點，所以主張統計律與數學的「或然律」的同一性，殊不知這是爲事實上所不許，爲邏輯上所不容的。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c124">談協覺 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 浩然</p>
<p>世界上有一些現象，初說似乎十分奇怪，但過細一想，便也平淡，協覺Synestbesia即爲一例。</p>
<p>所謂協覺，便指一種知覺有完全另外一種知覺的性質。例如有些完全常態的人，他們每每聽出聲調是有顏色的，低調好像深藍色，高調好像鮮紅色。有些人甚至於對於每一個子音和母音，都有各不相同的色覺，每一個字，便好像一副圖案似的。數月也可能有不同的顏色。有色的聽覺雖最普一遍，但是其它知覺也都有協覺的可能。</p>
<p>在一六六九年，有一個著名的丹麥解剖學家T.Bastholinus，曾發見一個聾子，在太陽光底下，便可以聽得淸楚些，就是一隻蠟燭光，似乎也可以帮助他的聽覺。美國心理學大師詹姆士，在他的鉅著『心理學原理』中，曾引過Urbantsclutsch遇見的一個例子：一個視覺不良的病人，在顏色太遠看不淸楚時，如果將一個音叉放在他的耳朶旁邊，他便立刻看得見了。近來有一個俄國的生現物理學家Lazareff曾當大衆表演過，他將鋼琴的踏脚踩下，然後重重地　一下普健，以後一聲不響地將電燈一開一滅，聽衆們便聽見那鋼琴發出一起一伏的聲調。顯然地，視覺與聽覺是在彼此影響着。</p>
<p>郞費爾德Laugfeld曾測驗過一個人對於音階的色覺，前後兩次，相隔七年，結果幾乎完全一致。這顯然說明事非偶然。</p>
<p>單調　覺色（1905年）　覺色（1912年</p>
<p>c　紅　紅</p>
<p>d　青　青</p>
<p>e　黃金　　陽光</p>
<p>f　紅淺　紅淺</p>
<p>g　藍　藍</p>
<p>a　黃　黃</p>
<p>b　銅色　銅色</p>
<p>達爾文的表弟戈爾呑F．Galton對於協覺的研究甚多，他曾遇見一個人對於數目各有不同的色覺：1爲黑，2爲黃，3爲磚紅，4爲褐黃，5爲黑灰，6為赭黃，7爲綠，8為淺藍，9為赭黃。此外，數目與字母亦可能有不同的空間形式，如下圖：</p>
<p>以上的現象說來固似離奇，但事實並非例外。我們要將北面的房間佈置得溫暖一些，我們便將它添成紅色。甫房我們　它太　，我們常用藍色或紫蘿關色來裝飾。這表示我們平日都公認色覺與溫度覺是有關係的，雖然色覺是屬於視覺的範園，而溫度覺是屬於膚覺的範圍。</p>
<p>我們知這上下是屬於空間知覺的範圍，但誰亦不能否認非空問的知覺亦有上下感。例如色彩，則淺色的在上，深的在下；輕重亦如此，輕的在上，重的在下；聲調亦如此，頻率高的在上，低的在下。香，味，冷熱也莫不皆可以分出上下來。總而言之，知覺並不是各自為謀，互不相涉的。從「通體相關」的理論看來，知覺是不乏一致性或統一性的。一切知覺都互相帮襯，互相影響。例如空間知覺，不但靠視覺，也靠聽覺，也靠觸覺，甚至也靠運動覺。例如眼球的運動，如眼珠的凸凹，雙目的對視，都是空間知覺的重要綫索。我們提起一斤棉花好像比提一斤鐵輕得多，這就說明輕重如何受視覺的影響。我們看見初昇的月亮大，月在中天時候便小得多，這似乎和一個人姿態有關係，直視與昂視可以影饗一個人的知覺。誰不曾看見雪白感覺到冷，看見爬虫而感覺滑膩？從知覺的統一，我們不但可以解釋一般的錯覺與幻覺，就是一般知覺也就得着了理論的基礎。協覺現象在如此意義下，便不但不希奇，而且是知覺的一致性的一個好例證了。</p>
<h3 id="c125">「人」的研究 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>原子彈出世以後，實際的政治家和科學家都在想法研究怎樣去控制原子彈，怎樣組織國際的機構去處理這種殺人的利器，或怎樣利用原子能使之由破壞的力量變爲建設的力量。這些工作我們不能說是不重要。可是尚有更重要的工作，實際的政洽家似乎便忽視了，而這就是「人」的研究。原子彈的本身並不可怕，可怕的是人，是運用原子彈的人，是有殺人的意念的人。不控制「人」，不設法消滅這「人」的殺人意念，則原子彈的控制是徒勞的。這一點，西方學者是見到了，所以這幾年來，關於「人」的研究，特別熱鬧。著名的哲人，如杜威（John　Dewey）有「人的問題」（Problems　of　Men）一書，如克西亞（Cassirer）有「諭人」（An　Essay　on　Man）一書。最近美國支加哥有一部分人從四百三十二部名著的索引中，發現西洋文化上一百零二個的根本觀念有五十一個是「人」　這可以證明「人」的問題怎樣爲西方學者所注意。過去資本主義盛行時，人是被視爲「經濟人」（Economic　Man）。在佛羅德（Freud）的心理學得勢時，人又曾被視爲「心理人」（Tsychological　Man）。現在天下一家的理想逐漸抬頭時，又有視人爲「世界人」（World　Man）的。「人」究竟是什麽呢？我們發掘了多少自然的秘密，我們有不少方法可以控制自然，我們發現了人的秘密嗎？我們有方法可以控制人嗎？「人」的研究應該是最重要的硏究，比原子能的硏究還　重要。</p>
<h3 id="c126">鮑桑克論不完善的自我 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 質如</p>
<p>每一個人是一個自我。每一個自我可能作壞事，有壞行。換言之，世界上有壞人，這是個事實，不是一個幻想。爲甚麼人會壞？這是一個很難解答的問題。簡單直接地說，鮑桑克以爲人之所以爲惡，乃由於吾人拘於吾人有限之自我，無力衝破其有限自我之蕃蘺而與天地萬物爲一體，或與絕對合一。所以吾人之有限性，及由此有限性而發生之懦弱無力，可以說就是萬惡底根源。但吾人底有限性並非固定不可移易的；而是可以超越的。因爲我們一方面固然是有限的，另一方面也是無限的。說明白些，就我們之爲一個一個的分殊的個體說，我們是有限的；但我們每一個人都與我們所處的這個宇宙有不可分離的內在的關係，我們底有限性正是有待於我們底無限性而顯示的。所以就我們之通萬物而爲一體說，我們就是無限的了。我們知道，眞理底追求，道德底成就都能擴充我們底自我，以與外物交通，以破除我們有限底樊籠，而與大全合一。這一稱從有限到無限，從個人到全體底發展是一個成德達善的歷程；若反此而行，即拘於自我而與人阻牾不通，乘戾背謬，則流於惡了　。鮑桑克以這個原則爲標準，而分不完善的自我爲三等。</p>
<p>（一）禽獸的自我，即沒有理性的自覺而無意識地過肉體慾望之生活的自我。這種自我底不完善是很顯明的，但肉體底需要和慾望，可以使我們爲惡，也可以使我們爲善。其本身實無善惡可言。這種自我是一個沒有原則的自我，還够不上一個人的自我。他底生活猶如一篇文章底材料，旣無結構，也沒有矛盾；僅僅在這個情形下，我們還不能當作惡去否定牠。（未完）</p>

<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>白　德（Irving　Babbitt）所倡導之人文主義（Humanism）與人道主義（Humanitarianism）有別，與浪漫主義（Romonticism）或惟情主義（Sentimenalism）針鋒相對，與自然主義（Naturalism）亦大相逕庭。人文主義與人道主義之區別，在於人道主義爲一種無差別之同情，人交主義則有差別的。即按關係之深淺而有親疏厚薄之分，亦可稱爲同情之選擇。一爲兼愛一爲有度量分際之愛，兩者截然不同，猶吾國古代儒墨二家之分。浪漫主義發源於法國之盧騷，（Roussdeau一七一二至七八）偏重感情，趨於極端，以感情衡量萬事，故又稱惟情主義。盧騷不重內心之修養，而欲殫其精力，以謀人羣之進步爲已任。人文主義則異是，從自己之修養入手，以好學深思進德修業，「向內做功夫」（Inner　Wrking）爲要義。浪漫派獻身於羣衆，或一階級，其弊爲外重內輕。人文主義則講求本末先後之序，注重深沉之思考力：謀理性與感情之和諧，而求人格上之完整。白　德以爲人生在思慮淸明之人爲一喜劇，在感情用事之人爲一悲劇。自十八世紀後半期以迄今日，西洋之文學藝術敎育哲學宗敎以至政治，均直接間接受浪漫運動之影響。此派感情衝動，達於狂熱之境其結果往往有破壞，無建設，使健全之人格爲之瓦解。人文主義之倡導所以矯正浪漫主義之流弊。人文主義之理想爲君子之風，君子有三長，即由庸敏感與合理。中庸之意爲克已，有節制，母太過，綜合各極端而掌握其重心之所在，故能趨於中行，不激不隨。幸福與尊嚴均由能自制而得之。敏感之反面爲麻木不仁，但亦非好奇立異之謂。此心廓然，能觀察問題之各方面，而加以審愼之判斷，其長處爲思想之邃密與見解之卓越。合理之義爲合於標準，標準於何求之，當求之於古來大思想家之大著作。古來大著作中所闡明之大觀念，乃超時空而存在，眞知灼見，大都歷久常新，而足爲吾人行事之準繩。故合理之義爲觀念之推廣，精神之解放，使此心獲得自由，不爲一時衝動所蔽，其最高境界爲從心所欲，不踰矩。敏感相當於中國之仁字合理相當於中國之禮字。曰仁，曰禮，曰中庸，以此三者釋君子之德行，與中國儒家學說最爲接近。與人文主義相對立者又有自然主義，此派受達爾文學說之影響，至十九世紀後半期（英國維多利亞時代）而大盛。美國機械文明與大量生產之發述尤過於他國，故大多數人眩惑於物質上之繁榮，醉心於科學之權力，對於較高之文化價值不免淡然置之。浪漫主義徧重感情作用，自然主義徧重機械作用，持之太過，均爲現代文化之通病，白　德以爲世界大戰乃十九世紀以來不良觀念之自然結果人文主義乃針對此種缺點而思有以補救之。人文主義者於浪漫主義格格不相入，但於藝術興味則予以保留，對於自然界之欣賞尤如山川之天然美景於人文修養甚爲有益。人文主義者於自然主義不能贊同，但於物質文明之高度效率，固不欲一併拋棄之。總之，人文主義之要旨爲生活之藝術，務期斯世之生活能達於盡善盡美之境界。又人文主義者自知其致力之範圍，而不欲網羅一切。白　德以爲凡欲籠罩一切者，其結果將一無所得。人文主義的致力者爲人事，人事以下之物受自然律之支配，人事以上之大，則屬於宗敎之領域。人文主義不能代替科學，亦不能代替宗敎。人文主義自歐洲文藝復興以後即有此說，惟現代人文主義者必須了解科學之方法與精神，與時　進，故又稱科學的新人文主義。白　德又喜引英人柏克（Ed-und　Burke）之語，謂西洋文化基於兩種原則，即宗教之精神與君子之精神。人文主義爲君子精神之表現。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Chinese and American governments today agreed to simultaneously announce in Nanjing and Washington the full text of the exchange of notes between U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and our Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, on April 30 of this year. In the exchange of notes, our country agreed to the various conditions for aid to China proposed by the U.S. in the form of "suggestions." Our government agreed to the dispatch of an Economic Cooperation Mission to China by the United States, while declaring that our government understood that the suggestions mentioned in the notes should not be regarded as constituting an "obligation of the U.S. government to provide aid to this country." In the exchange of notes, our government expressed its agreement with the purposes and policies of U.S. aid to China. Furthermore, both parties agreed in the exchange of notes that the funds authorized by Section 404(a) of the China Aid Act "shall be provided to China in the form of grants, except for those related to construction projects." Moreover, the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act of 1948 became law on April 3. As for the bilateral agreement between the Chinese and American governments stipulated in Section 405 of the Act, it is still under negotiation. The full text of the exchange of notes is as follows:</p>
<p>Note from Secretary Marshall to Ambassador Koo</p>
<p>Note from the Secretary of State of the United States of America to the Ambassador of the Republic of China to the United States of America: I have the honor to refer to the China Aid Act of 1948 (Title IV of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1948), which became law on April 3, 1948, and to transmit the following suggestions regarding the China Aid Act: The United States Government proposes, pending the conclusion of the Sino-American agreement stipulated in Section 405 of the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act of 1948, to determine the measures, until July 1948, to carry out the various tasks authorized by the Act, which are deemed necessary to promote the purposes of the Act and to apply the funds authorized by Section 404(a) of the Act. This action by the United States Government shall be subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions: Does your government agree with the purposes and policies listed in Section 402, which authorize the provision of assistance? Furthermore, does your government intend to conclude an agreement with the United States in accordance with Section 405 of the Act? The Secretary of State would be grateful for notification. Pending the conclusion of such an agreement, the Government of this country proposes that aid to China authorized by Section 404(a) of the Act shall be temporarily subject to the agreement concluded between our two Governments on October 27, 1947. However, in view of the different nature of the assistance under the Act and the relief assistance under the agreement of October 27, 1947, our two Governments may, by agreement, make changes to it, in particular with regard to the types of assistance and the conditions and methods of procurement and distribution, and subject to the following interpretations as preliminary measures. It is anticipated that, during the period mentioned in this note, assistance provided from funds authorized by Section 404(a) of the Act shall be provided to your Government in the form of grants, except for those related to construction projects. The terms for the reimbursement of funds for construction assistance will be determined at a later date. The Secretary of State proposes that, pending the determination of the terms of the agreement to be concluded between our two Governments in accordance with Section 405 of the Act, any assistance designated by the Government of this country as a grant shall be credited in Chinese currency in accordance with the provisions of the agreement concluded between our two Governments on October 27, 1947. The Secretary of State further proposes that such deposits may be used to pay for the administrative expenses in Chinese currency of the Government of this country in carrying out the China Aid Act of 1948 in your country, and for other purposes agreed upon by our two Governments. Future provisions in the agreement to be concluded between our two Governments regarding any deposits of Chinese currency shall apply to such assistance to your Government, determined to be a grant, during the period mentioned in this note. The Secretary of State is confident that your Government will agree to the above understanding. The Act authorizes the Government of this country to dispatch an Economic Cooperation Mission to your country. The Secretary of State would be grateful for assurance that your Government will fully cooperate with the representatives of the Government of this country in promoting the implementation of the Act. The Secretary of State is confident that your Government understands that the suggestions mentioned in this note should not be regarded as constituting an obligation of the Government of this country to provide assistance to your country. The Secretary of State avails himself of this opportunity to renew to the Ambassador the assurances of his highest consideration.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 3rd] Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, and Chen Qitian, Minister of Economic Affairs, jointly submitted a memorandum to the Executive Yuan recommending the organization of a Sino-American industrial technology survey mission to survey the steel, machinery, textile, electric power, and coal industries of the United States and other major industrial countries. The Executive Yuan has agreed in principle, but specific measures still need to be studied and formulated in detail. Weng and Chen suggested that the survey costs be paid from U.S. aid to China funds, and the estimated survey period is limited to four months to half a year. Therefore, this plan will be included in the U.S. aid utilization plan. The mission can only be formed after U.S. aid is utilized.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Bullitt Arrives in Shanghai from the United States: Will stay in China for about a month for inspections, scheduled to visit Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing this morning. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] William C. Bullitt, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, arrived in Shanghai for another visit yesterday afternoon at 4:15 pm on a Pan American Airlines flight. Many people went to Longhua Airport to welcome him, including Bei Zuyi, who had just returned from the United States, Zhang Bide, representative of Mayor Wu, Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Zhao Dihua, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, Chen Changtong, General Manager of the Foreign Department of the Bank of China, Conner of the U.S. Information Service, Wei Jingmeng of the Information Bureau, as well as the U.S. Consul General, the American Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of the Chinese financial community, totaling several dozen people. At the airport, Mr. Bullitt told reporters that his visit to China this time was purely a private one. Regarding rumors that he would be the implementer of the U.S. aid to China plan, Mr. Bullitt firmly denied it, saying that he had absolutely nothing to do with this matter, only saying: "I will stay in China for a month and return to the United States around the beginning of June. This time I plan to visit friends in China and want to learn about China's situation since I left China last September." When reporters asked him which aspect of the Chinese situation he wanted to know, economic, political, or military, Mr. Bullitt replied with a smile: "I am interested in any aspect of the Chinese situation, because I like China and love the Chinese people." Regarding Mr. Bullitt's visit areas in China, he has not yet decided. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing this morning on a U.S. military plane. After arriving in Nanjing, he will visit President Chiang Kai-shek and various friends, because he has many friends in Nanjing. The date of his stay in Nanjing has not been determined. It is reported that Mr. Bullitt will also go to various places in North China for inspection. After Mr. Bullitt arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he stayed at Bei Zuyi's residence. At around 6:00 pm, he went to the cocktail party of U.S. Consul General Cabell, and also met with Mayor Wu and others. In the evening, he had dinner at Bei's residence. According to relevant sources, Mr. Bei will accompany Mr. Bullitt to Nanjing. Therefore, although Mr. Bullitt himself has repeatedly stated that it has nothing to do with aid to China, outside speculation still believes that Mr. Bullitt will be the person in charge of the aid to China plan, but because it has not yet reached the time to announce it, the official authorities have not confirmed it.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Bei Zuyi arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, his mission being to welcome William C. Bullitt, who came to China to discuss the use of U.S. aid materials. According to a senior official of the Central Bank, after Bei met with Bullitt, he accompanied Bullitt to Nanjing. In the future, Bei is likely to be the host of the U.S. aid agency in our country. This agency will take the form of a committee directly under the Executive Yuan. The ministers of the four departments of agriculture, economy, finance, and food, and relevant officials such as the governor of the Central Bank, will be appointed as members.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] The American magazine "Time" today published a long letter from General He Yingqin to the newspaper, explaining why the progress of China's democratization is not as rapid as expected, and that the recent conflicts between nationalism and the Communist Party in various countries have created a serious crisis for all democratic countries in the world. This letter was written by He while he was residing here as the head of our country's military delegation to the United Nations.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang took advantage of the gathering of various comrades in Nanjing to attend the National Assembly and held a conversation meeting for National Assembly delegates on the 3rd at the National Assembly Hall to discuss politics, economics, and military affairs. The memorial week of the Premier was also held in the morning, presided over by Chiang in his capacity as Director-General. In addition to the Kuomintang National Assembly delegates, there were also members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees in Nanjing, totaling about two thousand people. The memorial week was held at 9:30 am. After the ceremony, the Director-General instructed, roughly divided into three parts: (1) a review of the performance of the party comrades in the National Assembly, (2) the direction in which the party comrades should work together after the completion of the National Assembly, and (3) points for the attention of the comrades. The instruction lasted about 40 minutes, ending at 10:20 am. After a 10-minute break, the conversation meeting was held. After Chairman Ju Zheng and Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng explained the procedure, the political review began. Today's focus was on the broad nature, so most opinions were expressed on principles. The meeting was adjourned at noon. The main points of Director-General Chiang's instructions are briefly recorded as follows: The Director-General first stated: "The National Assembly has achieved a satisfactory result this time, which is the greatest success of our party, and it can also be said that it has been achieved by the efforts of our party comrades in accordance with the teachings of the Premier. This point can indeed be reported to the spirit of the Premier in heaven. However, this conference can also be said to be one of the greatest lessons for our party comrades. Our performance, both good and bad, is visible." The Director-General then elaborated on the shortcomings and hoped that comrades could work hard to improve them. Secondly, the Director-General pointed out that the direction in which we should work after the completion of the National Assembly is in three parts. First, in politics, we should abide by the constitution and implement it in accordance with the spirit of the constitution, and show our spirit of the rule of law. This lies in the exercise of the principle of democracy. The second is to restore the territory of the Republic of China and ensure the territory of the Republic of China in order to complete the ideal of nationalism. The third is to promote land policy, implement equalization of land ownership, and control capital in order to achieve the implementation of the principle of people's livelihood. Finally, the Director-General's opinion is to emphasize the importance of "self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reflection." It is necessary to sacrifice the small self to complete the great self, and then eliminating the Communist Party will be as easy as turning one's hand. The Director-General's instructions received enthusiastic applause several times. The Director-General's extremely calm attitude and sincere words moved the participants.</p>
<p>In the afternoon at 3:00 pm, the economic and military reviews continued. Chairman Li Wenfan asked the representatives to speak separately and raised questions about the current administration. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 pm. The chairman announced: "All inquiries and written opinions will be compiled by the secretariat and submitted to the Director-General, and distributed to various ministries and commissions for replies, and then printed and distributed to all comrades." The conversation meeting was scheduled to hold a party affairs review for one day on the 4th. Also, the comrades who spoke today were dissatisfied with the current government measures. The various opinions were similar to those expressed during the review of the current situation held before the National Assembly. At the same time, they put forward the "innovation" proposal, believing that the current politics, military, and economy must be improved, and their words were激昂. Various party comrades who are responsible administrative heads, such as Yu Hongjun, Xue Dubi, and Yu Feipeng, attended and listened.</p>

I sincerely ask to be allowed to resign from all my posts concurrently, and I anxiously await orders." It is said that the intention to resign is very firm.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Science, Democracy, and Reason – Written to Commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Today is May 4th, the anniversary of the patriotic movement launched by the student community in the eighth year of the Republic of China, which was joined by the national education and business communities, forcing the warlord government to dismiss Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu, and Zhang Zongxiang. Time is like an electric wave. The youths who participated in the demonstrations in Beiping in those days are now mostly gray-haired, and this year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement.</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement was indeed led by the student community and the enthusiastically supporting education community, but the response spread throughout all levels of society, and its influence extended to all aspects of politics, economics, and culture. Those of us who have lived in Shanghai for a long time can imagine the enthusiasm of the Shanghai business community in opposing the Twenty-One Demands and dismissing those who signed the treaty - this precisely represents the national and civil rights consciousness under the oppression of foreign aggression and the chaotic politics of warlords. Subsequently, the transformation of the business, academic, and social atmosphere was all broadly influenced by it. Therefore, the so-called May Fourth Movement should be considered a broad social and cultural movement, not just a youth movement in the narrow sense.</p>
<p>From the May Fourth Movement's opposition to Japanese aggression to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China has experienced much pain and hardship externally, but its national status is still strong externally and weak internally. From the May Fourth Movement's advocacy of social and political reform in China to the promulgation of the constitution and the election of a new president today, China's internal affairs have undergone many difficulties and detours, but the scale of constitutional governance is only just beginning to be laid. This is truly enough to evoke endless emotions and motivate us to learn from the past to understand the future and review our gains and losses.</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement had the merit of liberating and promoting Chinese students and the Chinese social atmosphere, but it also had its negative influences. Over the past twenty years, there have been too many discussions about the merits and demerits of the May Fourth Movement, and there is no need for us to say more at this moment. We only cannot forget the two major signposts revealed in the May Fourth era: science and democracy. The so-called "Mr. Science" and "Mr. Democracy" were not only popular terms in society at the time but also the yardsticks for arguments in the public opinion circles and the ideals of all aspiring people. We recognize the May Fourth Movement as a national social and cultural movement, so we must look at how far these two weapons have evolved in China thirty years later, as well as our gains and losses in these two areas and the remedies we should make, to serve as the basis for our future efforts.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about science. When we browse newspapers and periodicals from around the eighth to tenth years of the Republic of China, we find articles advocating science everywhere. However, the substantive progress of science in China in these five or six years was far less than after the sixteenth year, while literary creation was a temporary darling. This symbolizes that the promotion of science at that time was only general discussions of science, superficial scientific methods, and a superficial scientific atmosphere, rather than scientific experiments, specialized scientific research, and a practical scientific spirit. What Qing Li saw in Western learning was the "strangeness of scientific instruments," what the May Fourth Movement yearned for was the "sacredness of science," but what we actually need should be the "delayed use of science," or rather, a nationwide scientific baptism. This incomplete respect for science certainly did the work of clearing the path for the advancement of science in China, but the actual work of scientific research wasted time. This error was due to the imitative mentality of quick success at the time, and secondly, to the precocious ideal of world peace. The former made us naively believe that as long as we fully absorbed, we would naturally progress. The latter made us temporarily abandon the nation's "carrying pole" and disregard the establishment of scientific national defense. More than ten years were easily wasted in revolution and foreign troubles. When the Lugou Bridge Incident expanded into a national war of resistance, the invading force that Japan relied on was scientifically equipped, while the extent to which our science and scientists could serve in combat was only similar to that of the May Fourth era. Our authorities could only painfully mark out the strategy of "trading space for time," and our soldiers and civilians could only bitterly shout out the slogan of "building the Great Wall with flesh and blood." This lesson is truly too cruel and too profound! From now on, we must painfully punish past mistakes and replace the promotion of scientific movements with actual scientific research. Scientific research in the new China must be a practical national action, a solemn task. Our government and business community should all have this understanding, and the intellectual youth who take the pursuit of knowledge as their sacred duty must have this thorough understanding, and can no longer regard "science" as a slogan and a concept, and delay themselves and the country in mediocrity and floating!</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about democracy. The democracy that was proclaimed in the May Fourth era did indeed do a lot of work in destroying and clearing away the chaotic politics of the warlords and the remaining vestiges of autocracy, and it had a widespread and deeply penetrating influence on society. But like science - let us use a term commonly used by Buddhists that is very clear - what was done at that time was more "breaking" than "establishing," pushing away the dregs of anti-democracy but not truly welcoming in the belief in democracy, let alone planning for a democratic system. The enlightened youth and educators of the May Fourth era were influenced by European and American democratic politics and had a great admiration for democracy but did not actually do the work of adapting to a democratic life from themselves and society. As political revolution progressed, due to military force, there were certainly many intellectual youths who participated, overthrew the warlords, and prepared for constitutional governance based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings by establishing political tutelage. In over ten years, the government failed to fully display the spirit of democracy, and there were still many internal and external reasons. However, our social progress even more failed to keep pace with the progress of politics. Our level of education and our concepts cannot produce sound local self-government personnel, cannot create universal habits of obeying the law, cannot exert the power of public opinion to restrain, and cannot easily elect national representatives, the vast majority of whom have the basic qualities of "tolerating dissenting opinions" and "obeying the majority." This is naturally due to many years of factors in various aspects, but the May Fourth Movement also sowed a fundamental error: at that time, it did not explore the true source of modern democratic politics, the civic education and law-abiding spirit of the masses. Now we have entered the stage of constitutional governance, but we cannot deny that the current national education still cannot meet the needs of constitutional governance, and we should punish and learn from past mistakes and intensify efforts to remedy the situation from the grassroots level of society. We must supervise political progress and root out corruption and mediocrity; but only if the people have the wisdom and ability to supervise the government can an unstoppable politics be established. True, broad democracy is a way of life and a cultural model. Only on top of a social culture and life with democratic manners can a democratic government truly be produced.</p>
<p>Science and democracy began to raise their heads in China during the May Fourth era, but they did not have rich fertilizers to nurture and grow them. Even for more than ten years, we lingered for a long time in the stage of passively destroying anti-science and anti-democracy, but the effects were not yet significant, and we failed to plant the foundations for actively establishing scientific research and democratic manners in the broader society and in academic culture. What is the fundamental reason for this? We believe that it is because the people of our country still do not know how to value the fundamental spirit of modern countries - reason. The May Fourth era was not devoid of reason, but in fact, the driving force of all activities at that time was the outpouring of emotion rather than the cultivation of intellect. It was so for the youth, it was so for the middle-aged, and it was mostly so for the entire society. A movement, of course, cannot do without passionate and sincere emotions, but it needs to be supplemented by calm and solid reason. We worship science, but we have not accepted the spirit of "love of knowledge" from reason and engaged in solid specialized research. We admire democracy, but we have not accepted the cultivation of politics from reason and increased our ability to understand and improve politics. Even today, what is expressed in the youth is still often dominated by impulsiveness and emotions. Military suppression of turmoil and economic difficulties have increased social unrest and created a climate of resentment and blame. This climate influences the youth through the middle-aged, but unfortunately, it has failed to pass the test and transformation of "reason." The passion of the May Fourth Movement is in the past, and the reason that was lacking in the May Fourth era has still not been promoted and amplified today to supplement its deficiencies. This cannot but be said to be the fundamental concern for the progress of science and the realization of constitutional governance in China!</p>
<p>Maintaining the true and excellent traditions of the May Fourth Movement, the passionate and forward-looking vigor, and enhancing the application of reason to supplement and amplify the spirit of the May Fourth Movement to promote the progress of science and constitutional governance in China are the fundamental needs of the new China and should also be the criteria for the efforts of our nation's youth and people from all walks of life.</p>

<h3 id="e46">US Establishes Strong Air Force, Appropriation Bill Expected to be Approved by Congress, House Military Affairs Committee Passes Draft Law <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] San Francisco, 3rd broadcast: The US House Military Affairs Committee today passed a bill by a vote of 28 to 5, stipulating that men aged 19 to 25 serve for two years, with veterans being exempt. After the passage of this bill, the strength of the Navy, Army, and Air Force can be increased from the current 1,384,500 to 2,005,882 in 1950.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] A bill to establish a thoroughly modernized air force with 12,441 combat aircraft and 502,000 personnel is expected to be passed by Congress this week. The bill is the first appropriation for a plan to expand the existing Air Force from 55 groups to 70 groups within two years, plus 804 jet fighters and 49 of the latest heavy bombers (including 17 jet-propelled ones). The House of Representatives has already passed the bill, and the Senate, based on the recommendation of the Appropriations Committee, is expected to pass it early this week. The entire two-year plan will cost $7.5 billion, more than two and a half times the existing appropriations. Congress has exceptionally approved an additional $857 million to the government's request to expand the air force. Secretary of Defense Forrestal only requested expansion to 66 groups, but Secretary of the Air Force Symington believes that 70 groups are the minimum necessary to maintain national security in peacetime. 70 groups are only a quarter of the US Air Force's wartime strength, but are still a significant increase over pre-war strength.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The US Air Force, hailed by the US Congress as the new first line of defense, is planning to purchase a perfect new fleet of aircraft within five years. Procurement officials are confident in their selection of jet and propeller-driven aircraft. In the past two years, most of the work has focused on research and development, but now the focus is on practical application. The Senate will discuss this week the appropriation bill passed by the House of Representatives by an overwhelming majority, allocating $229,500,000 to the Air Force as the first year's funds for purchasing aircraft. This fund can purchase 2,900 of the 25,541 aircraft that the Air Force needs in its so-called 70-group plan. If the Senate rejects the House's additional $822 million, the Air Force will modernize according to the 55-group plan, which would allow it to use $1,473,000,000 to purchase 1,900 aircraft.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 3rd] Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of US Forces in South Korea, denounced on the 3rd that the "ridiculous rumors" about the United States spread by the Soviet Union are a Communist plan to make all of Korea a part of Soviet enslavement. In his letter of more than 1,000 words to the Korean people, Hodge warned: "Yielding to the Soviet plan, Korea has only one way to go to death."</p>
<p>Hodge recounted the process of the division of Korea into North and South due to the split between the United States and the Soviet Union, saying: "The facts are clear, the Soviet Union and its traitorous Korean pawns have done everything possible to blame the United States. They have done their best to publicize that the United States hopes to turn Korea into a colony for the United States to use as a military base. The above is of course the most absurd statement." He then criticized the North Korean government under the Communist wing, which claimed the right to rule all of Korea through a new constitution. Hodge said that those who passed the constitution were only "a few puppets who accepted the orders of foreign masters." Hodge urged the people of South Korea to participate in the May 10th vote in the US occupation zone to express "personal answers." He strongly condemned the boycott of the election by the people of North Korea, because they "fear participating in the general election, which will show their numerical inferiority and cannot betray the country to make Korea a Communist satellite country. The election they fear is monitored by impartial international observers, which is completely different from the Communist Party's deaf and dumb election."</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Last night, on the eve of the "May Fourth" anniversary, a brawl broke out among students at Great China University on Zhongshan Road, resulting in injuries to three students. Fortunately, the local police station, together with the university authorities, intervened to maintain order, and normalcy was quickly restored. After investigation, four students were found to be heavily involved and were temporarily detained at the Zhenru Police Station at 1:30 AM this morning. It is reported that the incident originated from a dispute during a sound film screening held on the evening of the 2nd by the Recreation Department of the Joint Association of the six departments, including Political Economy, where someone cut the power cord, leading to conflicting opinions among the students. Last night, more than a hundred students from Great China University went to St. John's University to attend a commemorative May Fourth Movement literary evening. After the event, at about 9:15 PM, this group of students, along with over a hundred students from St. John's University, marched towards Great China University in formation. Upon entering the campus, they shouted slogans and sang spirited songs. At that time, most of the faculty and students were already asleep. Some students responded after hearing the commotion, while others within the university believed that their late-night entry was disruptive and disturbing to public peace and attempted to stop them. A conflict ensued between the two sides. In the chaos, three students were injured: (1) Yu Peiji, a student of Great China University, sustained head injuries. (2) Zhang Yingran, a student of Great China University, suffered eye injuries from a silk net. (3) Pan Xiang, an off-campus student, was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment due to the severity of his injuries. At that time, most of the students who had marched into the campus left in the confusion. The university immediately reported the incident to the police, dispatched personnel to mediate, and the disturbance was quickly quelled. Simultaneously, they launched an investigation into the origins of the dispute and the individuals responsible for the disturbance. With the assistance of students within the university, the following was discovered: (1) Yu Peiji (a male student from the Banking Department) is suspected of leading the disturbance. (2) Hua Yun, a female student from the History and Sociology Department, is the head of the Recreation Department of the Six Departments. (3) Zhang Yingran (female). (4) Zhong Guoying (female). These students were found to be in possession of printed materials such as "May Fourth Preparatory Program." A large red paper flower was also found on Hua Yun, with a small white slip of paper attached to the back, which read, "Welcoming the eternal spring in history." In addition, an off-campus student named Li Yiju, whose student status is unknown, remains at Great China University and will be released today after verification by his school.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Hundreds of Newspapers Reprint, 70 Million People Appreciate, "Believe It or Not" Author Robert Ripley Arrives in Shanghai to Seek Material <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Robert Ripley, the American author of "Believe It or Not" comics, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the President Cleveland to collect material, and is staying at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>Robert Ripley is the creator of the "Believe It or Not" comics. The strange and bizarre things he depicts have swept the globe. His works are reprinted in 326 newspapers in 38 countries and in 17 different languages. It is estimated that more than 70 million people enjoy his comics every day.</p>
<p>[Image: "Believe It or Not" comic author Robert Ripley (Photographed by this newspaper)]</p>
<p>How He Became Famous</p>
<p>Robert Ripley has been drawing "Believe It or Not" for 34 years, without a single day's interruption. His famous work was a story about aviator Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic. Everyone knows that Lindbergh was the first to cross the Atlantic, but his comic said: "Lindbergh was the 67th person to fly across the Atlantic non-stop." In fact, he was right, because although Lindbergh was the hero who initiated and completed the first flight across the Atlantic, in his flight, there were two planes and two airships, and he himself piloted the last plane. There were exactly 66 people sitting in the first plane and the two airships.</p>
<p>Loves Traveling</p>
<p>For example, Ripley gathered such surprising facts with a lot of effort. He himself loves to travel, and Duke Windsor has called him the "Modern Marco Polo". Almost every remote corner of the world has his footprints, and all the novel things he sees and hears become good materials for his writing. In addition, readers all over the world contribute to him, and he receives tens of thousands of letters every year. In order to organize these materials, he employs a large number of staff to carry out verification work to explore whether these strange things have a basis and to decide whether to adopt them. For the materials he adopts, the payment depends on the value of the content, usually about five US dollars per item.</p>
<p>Born Poor</p>
<p>Like the strange things in his writing, Robert Ripley himself is also a strange person. He is 56 years old this year, but he is still single. He is in excellent health, never smokes, and never plays poker. He draws his comics upside down. He was born into poverty. His father was a carpenter who died when he was twelve. When he was a child, he picked up tennis balls for others to earn money to supplement his family. Later, he used his talent to draw posters, and then worked as a sports cartoonist for a newspaper. His first "Believe It or Not" was unintentionally accomplished. After being published, it was unexpectedly welcomed by readers, and he gradually became famous.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Chinese Readers Actively Contribute <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>This time he came to the East to collect material, from Manila via Hong Kong to Shanghai, and will fly to Tokyo in three days. His "Believe It or Not" comics are reprinted in the English Continental Daily in this city. Since the news that he was coming to Shanghai was announced, many Chinese readers have contributed to the Continental Daily to pass on to him. These contributions include the "Immortal Maiden" who was recently discovered in Chongqing and has not eaten for nine years, abstruse mathematical diagrams, and illustrated explanations of Chinese characters. One letter contained a 5,000-yuan banknote, and the contributor said that the banknote was used after being signed on a certain day and returned to his own hands on the same day a year later. Even more simply, a pair of letters wrote this sentence: "The Continental Daily is the only Chinese newspaper that publishes Robert Ripley's comics." Yesterday, Ripley showed reporters a large pile of these letters and said with a smile that he had not had time to look at them carefully yet.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Gu Zhuxuan's Age Becomes an Issue, Refugees Accuse Him of Extorting Money Through Longevity, Unsigned Accusation Claims Justification <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Gu Zhuxuan, the boss of Tianchan Dance Hall, was accused yesterday by a group of Northern Jiangsu refugees to the District Prosecutor's Office, claiming that Gu was extorting money through his birthday and stealing relief rice. The complaint stated that Gu turned 60 years old on April 22 this year, but in reality, Gu is 63 years old, which can be proven by his household registration. Before the birthday, he sent out invitations everywhere, and the Northern Jiangsu refugees all contributed money to celebrate his birthday. It is estimated that Gu's birthday income reached more than 4 billion yuan, and a golden plaque with the words "Virtue Covers the Jianghuai" was publicly presented and is still hanging in Gu's home. Also, last year's refugee relief rice, each person was allocated two dou, and the rice money was 24,000 yuan, but as a result, the rice was not distributed, and Gu and others embezzled and divided it. The end of the complaint was signed by Northern Jiangsu refugees and explained the reason for not signing their names, because they were refugees living abroad and were currently living in refugee shelters. If their real names were known to Gu, they were at risk of being expelled from the refugee shelters. The District Prosecutor's Office will summon the relevant persons for questioning in the coming days.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Today is the 29th anniversary of the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement. The cultural circles of this city will gather at the Cultural Hall at 9:00 AM this morning to celebrate enthusiastically. In addition, the students of major middle and high schools in this city are scheduled to hold a 25,000-person "May Fourth" bonfire rally at Jiaotong University tonight to perform various commemorative programs. Also, Jiaotong, Tongji, and St. John's universities held literary evenings last night, inviting Cao Weifeng, Zhang Choubo, Meng Xianzhang, and Xia Kangnong to attend and give speeches. The students from nearby middle and high schools who participated were very enthusiastic. Jiaotong University also held an exhibition of student sports photos and cartoons and published a "May Fourth" commemorative special issue.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhu Jingnong, President of Guanghua University, attended the National Assembly and returned to Shanghai the other day. Yesterday, in response to a request from a reporter of this newspaper, he expressed his personal thoughts on the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement, saying: "I was studying abroad in the United States at the time and had not yet returned to China. Some people said that I was also a leading figure at the time, which is a mistake." Zhu believes that the achievements of the "May Fourth" Movement, in a positive aspect, lie in advocating democracy and science, both of which have true and permanent value. Science has two functions: one is to use scientific methods to study various disciplines and sort out our country's ancient books and history; the other is to promote science itself. Although our country's science has not yet been fully developed, in the past 30 years, due to the occurrence of the "May Fourth" Movement, the Chinese people have known the importance of science, which is a phenomenon of progress. In a negative aspect, President Zhu believes that the aestheticism advocated by Mr. Cai Yuanpei has not been adequately recognized and worked on by the Chinese people, so the achievements are not significant, especially the slogan "Labor is Sacred" shouted at that time, which the general youth did not put into practice. Life is education, and I have always advocated "hands are omnipotent". No matter how biased the thinking of young people is, they should all move in this direction, and I hope that the society will pay attention to it in the future.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper's accompanying interview and broadcasting vehicle for the Beijing-Shanghai torch relay long-distance run broadcast for the first time at 6:00 AM on the 3rd] The torch relay long-distance run has now continued its progress from Tangshan, led by the command vehicle. The first torchbearer is Xu Dianyun, who is carrying the President's inscription on his back and holding the torch. Because the road is muddy after the rain, it is difficult to move forward, but the spirit of each runner is very high.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's interview vehicle broadcast for the second time at 7:00 AM on the 3rd] The vehicle's radio station is currently in communication with the Beijing Amateur Radio Station. The relay race has now passed Jurong. Hundreds of people are standing by the roadside to welcome the team, and the local national primary school is lining up to offer flowers amidst the sound of firecrackers. Team member Ling Huijie accepts his father</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's interview vehicle broadcast for the third time at 9:15 AM on the 3rd] The vehicle is communicating with the Taiyuan Amateur Radio Station.

<p>[Our newspaper's interview vehicle broadcast for the fifth time at 1:35 PM on the 3rd] The vehicle is currently communicating with the Guangzhou Amateur Radio Station. The third team has now passed Liyang. Thousands of spectators applauded and welcomed the team. The sound of firecrackers never stopped. All sectors of Liyang had prepared a tea party to provide a grand reception, but the athletes had to decline slightly due to the scheduled time. The Boy Scouts played music to send them off, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic as never before.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's interview vehicle broadcast for the sixth time at 4:15 PM on the 3rd] We are currently communicating with the Shen Bao Radio Station. Huang Shuguo, the last member of the third team, has arrived in Yixing. The third stage is 89 kilometers long, the longest distance of the entire route. The team completed the entire course in six hours and thirty-five minutes, half an hour ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's interview vehicle last broadcast at 10:00 PM on the 3rd] Today, the Shen Bao accompanying interview vehicle traveled west from Tangshan, successively loading the runners who had completed their portions, and broadcasting the situation along the way. The people gathered to listen, feeling very interested. In Yixing, thousands of spectators held firecrackers and surrounded our newspaper's vehicle and the athletes, competing to ask questions.

<h3 id="e101">Short-Distance Star Liu Changchun Speaks About Athletes from the Northeast <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] On the medium landing craft, among the crowd wearing plain uniforms symbolizing "White Mountains and Black Waters," I found Liu Changchun, the short-distance star who had participated in three National Games and created a national record of 10.7 seconds in the 100-meter dash. Nearly eight years had passed. A few strands of white hair made him sigh softly: "I am already 39 years old this year."</p>
<p>For the past few years, he has been teaching physical education at Zhongzheng University in Pan Yang. This time, he is leading a large army south in the name of general manager. I hoped he could tell me some miracles, or that under his training and cultivation, the Northeast would have someone who could at least be on par with "10.7 seconds." However, it brought him a bellyful of emotion: "This cannot be compared with before the war," he said. "After the victory, the situation in the Northeast has been tense, and the emotions of those in training have been greatly discounted. In the 100-meter dash, they can only achieve results of 11.4 or 5 seconds."</p>
<p>The icy and snowy weather especially limits the athletes' ability to perform. Liu Changchun said, "When we left the Northeast, the ground had just begun to melt and the grass and trees were just sprouting, so we never had the opportunity to accurately measure or record the actual strength of our athletes." He humbly stated that he had no ambition or confidence in winning any prizes this time. A week before their departure, they still had not decided whether to come or not because of money. He said to the reporter, "Although there is not enough funding, everyone feels that it is necessary to come, so the purpose of this trip is still focused on the spirit, because we really have no achievements to brag about to others."</p>
<p>After repeated requests from the reporter, he slightly revealed some items that he thought were relatively presentable. Li Linghui's 800-meter run has a time of 2 minutes and 4 seconds, and the intermediate hurdle has a time of 57.7 seconds, which is relatively close to the national records of 2 minutes and 2.2 seconds and 58.3 seconds. Secondly, Guo Jianzhang's discus throw is 38.5 meters, and the sixteen-pound shot put is 12.3 meters.</p>
<p>These are not enough to rely on. As many people expect, we will be surprised and encouraged by an unexpected dark horse!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] After the Hong Kong volleyball team arrived in Shanghai yesterday, they went to St. John's University in Fanhuangdu to play a friendly match with the city's Huayan team. After five sets of intense fighting, the visiting team won three to two.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team is represented by the champion of the selection competition, St. Paul's College, so their coordination and tacit understanding are superior. They and the Heshan team, which represents the police, both have hopes of winning the championship.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team's defense is better than its offense. The front row locks down the net, demonstrating great skill. The three-row saves are too demonstrative.</p>
<p>The entire Huayan team was present, and Kong Xiangji was also invited to help, but it was still difficult to challenge the visitors.</p>
<p>Before the match, the visiting team presented two banners to Huayan and the host St. John's, each receiving one.</p>
<p>Qi Jianhong from the Special Service School of the Joint Logistics Headquarters officiated the match. His quick eyes and sharp tongue added a lot of color to the game.</p>
<p>Xinjiang athletes also came to watch the game, all wearing black tops and red hats, and were received by Dong Jun, a reporter from the John's Sports Weekly, and visited the entire school.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The selection meeting for the World Games basketball team was originally scheduled to be held at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM yesterday. However, because a few committee members were unable to attend, it was temporarily decided to postpone the meeting. It is understood that this meeting will discuss the selection principles and technical issues. The rumor that the list of candidates has been internally decided is premature. Before the National Games basketball championship has even begun, this matter has not been considered.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Twenty-One Football Teams Confront Each Other: Sharp Confrontation; Future Predictions Before the Fierce Battle <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] The football championship battles of the Sixth National Games once swept hundreds of thousands of Chinese and foreign fans. In particular, the battles between the four strongest teams, Hong Kong, Malayan Chinese, Guangdong, and Shanghai, gave the audience countless tense and thrilling memories. Thirteen years have passed. Now the four heroes' flags meet again in the old place. It can be said that enemies meet, especially red eyes. Of course, there will be another fierce battle. Compared with the previous session, eight teams are missing: Lu, Anhui, Ping, Xiang, Gan, Ji, and Qinghai and Liaoning. However, nine teams have been added: Guizhou, Dalian, Siam, Hankou, the Philippines, and the Five Armies. Speaking of momentum, it is indeed more vast than the previous session; speaking of lineup, the configuration is also extremely neat; talking about talent, although the World Games team has taken away a lot of elite, there are still many veterans and newcomers among the 21 teams. What's more, it is rare for the four strongest teams and the Five Armies to meet. How could this close-quarters battle not be wonderful?</p>
<p>Many of the twenty-one teams have never shown their faces in Shanghai. Here, let's take a look at them first:</p>
<p>The entire fourteen-member Sichuan team was almost entirely selected in Chengdu, including six from West China University, two from the Provincial Sports College, two from Sichuan University, and three civil servants. Only one person participated from outside the county. Because the team was formed not long ago, there was no time to practice, so they set off for Shanghai. It is difficult for the team to coordinate as ideally as they would like. The defensive line, in particular, is a weaker link. The forward configuration is slightly stronger. Right inside forward Chen Mingdao can be called a genius in personal technique. Long passes, short passes, shooting, and rushing are all excellent. It is a pity that there is a lack of cooperation, which is a fly in the ointment. Otherwise, if they attack to defend, they can barely make up for the weakness of the rear. Goalkeeper Xi Zhaolong is still considered stable and is a well-chosen talent from the Provincial Sports College. Whether he can maintain a stable situation in the first battle against the police will depend on how he displays his skills of blocking left and right.</p>
<p>The Henan team's lineup has been arranged:</p>
<p>Wang Tianxiang Liu Minsheng</p>
<p>Zhang Jimin Guan Xinyou</p>
<p>Yan Shaozu Chai Juzhen Yang Xishan</p>
<p>Yuan Shan Shan Yi-wang Cheng Pengqian Zhang Juzhen Guo Shichang</p>
<p>Like Sichuan, the team's selection is limited to Kaifeng, so students account for as many as thirteen of the team's seventeen members: ten from Yuda and three from Kai Normal. Amateurs make up only four people. The advantage of forming a team with students is that they are agile and have plenty of physical strength, but the disadvantage is that they have less experience and insufficient skills. Most of the team members participated in the Central China Games held in Hankou, winning several games. In the end, they lost to Hunan. At that time, Shan Yiwang charged forward and Chai Juzhen echoed back and forth. Their rapid short passes really won a lot of praise. This shows that they would not have been able to do this without physical strength. This time, the team will encounter a strong enemy, Guangdong, in the first battle. Putting aside the victory or defeat, just looking at the physical strength shown by this group of young athletes from Central China in their running and chasing is enough to make us yearn for them.</p>
<p>The Guizhou team can be said to be the best-spirited team in this National Games football team. Of the fifteen members of the team, Xue Wenxiu, the secretary-general of the provincial government, personally serves as the captain and also doubles as the center forward, commanding the three armies. Luo Shiqi, director of the Fourth Police Bureau of Guizhou, protects the liaison line and guards the center. Just looking at these two titles, you can imagine how energetic this team is! The team members include students, civil servants, businessmen, and citizens. It is completely a miscellaneous army. However, the diversity of their positions does not affect their confidence in their own spirit. When they learned that they would be facing the strong army of the Army or Qingdao in the first battle, they said that they would put the victory or defeat aside and remain consistent throughout the battle, not being afraid or shrinking back, and doing their best to the end.</p>
<p>The strength of the Hankou team is quite solid and average. Main general Zhang Dejiang is a famous football player in North China. Center backs Cheng Ruiyun and Yang Shuanggui are the famous and earthshaking duo in Wuhan. Defender Sun Shunxiang, a famous general from the Ping-Han team, is responsible for difficult tasks. The goalkeeper is Ye Tao, a basketball player from Hankou. The team is based on eight members of the Ping-Han team, plus two air force members and two students. The eight members of the Ping-Han team have all made a name for themselves in several large and small football battles in Hubei Province, especially Cheng, Yang, and Sun. The team's weakness lies in the slightly weaker goalkeeper, but in the future, they can rely on the help of the center and rear defensive lines. There are many good football players in Hankou, but this time they were dispersed due to the separate efforts of Hankou, Hubei Province, and the Joint Logistics Command to win them over. A major highlight was thus broken down into smaller parts. This time, the team will face the Air Force in the first battle. A fierce battle is inevitable when two strong teams meet. Whether the team will make progress in the future depends on how the five forwards under the command of Zhang Dejiang connect and pass. Whether the team can defend firmly depends on how Cheng, Yang, and Sun intercept and echo each other.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Seventh National Games will open tomorrow. The opening ceremony will be held at 3:00 PM at the Jiangwan Municipal Sports Stadium. The Organizing Committee of the Games has also sent invitations to the diplomatic community, government leaders, and business leaders in the city to attend the ceremony. About a thousand invitations have been sent, but the seats on the West Commander's Platform of the venue are limited. If the invited guests bring their families with them, there will be no way to accommodate them. However, it is not possible to indicate "one person per invitation" and enter the venue with the invitation. According to Vice Chairman of the Games and Chairman of the Organizing Committee Mayor Wu, he has decided not to bring his wife. If his sons and daughters want to come, they must buy tickets to enter the venue, setting an example.</p>
<p>For the opening ceremony on the first day, those who want to participate as citizens of the city must buy tickets to enter the venue, which is of great concern to a group of gentlemen and ladies. According to news from the ticketing section of the Games, the Games has borrowed ten post office booths from the post office and distributed them around the venue as ticket booths. These square-shaped booths have windows on all four sides, and four people can buy tickets at the same time each time. Ten ticket booths mean there are forty ticket offices. When the time comes, buying tickets should not be too difficult. Moreover, these forty ticket sellers are all women, which can avoid all kinds of abuses such as holding and manipulating tickets. Tickets for the opening ceremony on the first day are divided into two types: 200,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Report] With the 7th National Games about to begin, the five units of the National Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, and Joint Logistics Command are participating for the first time. Police Commissioner Xuan Tiewu, to express goodwill, hosted all the representatives at the Ciro's nightclub yesterday (3rd) at 3 PM. Except for the 120 Air Force representatives, led by President Hu Yike and Chief of Staff Zhou Yichen, who will arrive in Shanghai tonight and were unable to attend, there were 85 Navy representatives, 100 Army representatives, 126 Police representatives, and 100 Joint Logistics Command representatives. Guests included Port Commander Zhou Lixing, Wusong Fortress Commander Shao Baichang, Air Force Base Commander Wang Weimin, Deputy Commander Sun Tonggang, and Garrison Commander Fu Zhengmo, totaling over 400 people. The hall was set up in the dance floor, with the national flag in the center and slogans "Unite to Save the Nation" and "Suppress Bandits to Save the People" on both sides, creating a solemn and magnificent atmosphere. After the meeting began, Commissioner Xuan delivered a speech, stating that soldiers have organization, training, obedience to orders, and discipline. With these excellent traditions, he hoped that they could show them to the athletes and spectators, and win the intangible spirit trophy, which is more valuable than the tangible one. Guests and team leaders Commander Shao Baichang, Commander Dong Mozen, Commander Wang Weimin, Commander Zhou Lixing, and Bureau Chief Yu Shuping then gave speeches, encouraging all athletes to demonstrate the spirit of "good soldiers as role models for good citizens." Finally, the Army representative gave a thank-you speech. After that, refreshments were served, and the Chinese Harmonica Society played famous songs, including a victory march titled "Return Our Rivers and Mountains," which won applause from the entire audience. Everyone was uncontrollably filled with emotion and cheered "Long Live the Republic of China" repeatedly. The grand event ended joyfully around 4 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Temporary Post Office During the Games <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] To facilitate the mailing of letters and remittances for the National Games personnel and spectators, the post office has set up two temporary post offices during the Games:</p>
<p>The first one is located next to the east grandstand of the venue, open from 9 AM to 6 PM daily. Services include selling stamps, mailing letters, savings and remittances, and selling philatelic stamps.</p>
<p>The second one is located at the athlete dormitory of the Central Training Corps on Shuishui Road, open from 6 AM to 10 PM daily. The services are the same as the first one. At the same time, a mobile post office car will be dispatched to provide services throughout the venue. It is also said that the post office will use a specially made date stamp for commemoration.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Rushing to Finish, Most Afraid of Wet Paint: The Three-Event Female Athletes Show Their Talents <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] In just one day and one night, the great show will begin. Those making advertising boards in the stadium, opening temporary shops, and rushing to complete the sports fields are all creating "miracles": to complete everything in a few dozen hours. My biggest worry is: if the weather is bad today (4th), won't the wet paint on the signs of many shops and the newly painted basketball hoops be ruined?</p>
<p>On both sides of the road leading to the venue, small shops and newspaper offices stand side by side, like a small and prosperous town. Although the "materials" of those houses are only thin bamboo and plywood, the exteriors are brightly colored in red and green, heavily decorated, and with innovative designs, using all possible methods. This is what is called "Shanghai style."</p>
<p>Shen Bao's office has two rooms, "close" to each other. One side has a large Earth brand electric clock, and the other has a thermometer as big as a burly man (borrowed from the Shanghai Science Factory). These two giant objects will be serving the public non-stop during the games.</p>
<p>Due to continuous rain in recent days, the track and field is full of water-filled traps. Yesterday, they were rushing to "pave" the track. I hope it doesn't rain again today!</p>
<p>The paint on the gym floor is not yet dry, and the boundaries of the courts were just painted yesterday.</p>
<p>Tickets for students and groups are priced at 20,000 yuan per ticket, and many staff members are working hard to stamp them.</p>
<p>Prizes are arriving one after another, mostly silver shields, such as the "Martial Spirit" award from the City Council. The reporter has always felt that the prizes for each National Games are mostly the same, and the format always feels plain and unremarkable. The types are nothing more than shields, cups, flags... After a long time, they inevitably feel a bit vulgar. I hope that people who like to use their brains can create more meaningful forms of prizes.</p>
<p>Yue Sui [Guangdong and Guangzhou] team member said, "It's already the changing season in Guangdong, but I didn't expect to see so many people wearing coats when I arrived in Shanghai. I was very surprised. Sure enough, a cold wind blew and I got goosebumps, so many athletes caught colds."</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Feng, the leader of the Sichuan team, said that their more promising events are shot put and the women's 50-meter race. Their individual skills in football are also very good, but the coordination is lacking. Their standards for selecting athletes are based on the top three in track events and the top six in field events in the previous National Games. The athletes participating in national martial arts are even more outstanding, selected from the two best out of the eight best in the province. Among the 25 athletes: eight are from West China University, three are from Sichuan University, two are from the Institute of Physical Education, and others include the head of the Education Department of the Provincial Government, etc.</p>
<p>The female athletes from Guizhou moved from Shang Lian Su to the Great Church at 4 PM yesterday. Each of them carried two large bundles of luggage: some were calm and unhurried, while others were sweating profusely. It turned out that some were three-event athletes, while others were just good at basketball.</p>
<p>The athletes from Hankou City complained bitterly, saying that the hospitality of the conference was too disappointing. In addition, their own funding was insufficient, and prices in Shanghai were expensive, so most of the athletes stayed indoors and kept to themselves. The athletes from Guizhou only observed the situation. In the large dormitory, beds were arranged horizontally, and snores rose and fell.</p>
<p>The athletes from Xinjiang each wore a red hat with a registered trademark, which could be easily identified from a distance.</p>
<p>Jin Zengcheng, the former head of the Guangdong team in the first three National Games, is now elderly. He recently came to Shanghai after participating in the National Assembly. He said, "It is expected that this National Games will not have excellent results. However, I still encourage all athletes."</p>
<p>The athletes from Northeast China arrived in Shanghai by landing craft yesterday. They had experienced many hardships along the way. The athletes from Hankou sympathized with them, saying that they had not slept for three days on the ship, and the train ride was bumpy and unfamiliar. They had no place to complain.</p>
<p>Athletes from all over the country are visiting a foreign land and miss their homes very much. The post office has an office in Jingye Hall, and business is booming.</p>

<p>According to the Meteorological Observatory, the weather on the first day of the National Games (May 5th) will be sunny without a doubt, and the temperature will also be higher than the current one, around 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is good weather for sports.</p>
<p>20,000 copies of the National Games program have been sold yesterday. Although the price is as high as 160,000 yuan per copy, they were sold out as soon as they hit the market. However, the "athletes" feel overwhelmed by this "high price."</p>

<p>[Our Report] In addition to Wang Yongfang and Zhang Pu, two representatives from Jilin Province who arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and team leader Wang Shizhen, representatives Wang Fuhai, Wang Shide, Wang Fulin, and Qi Baozhu, five people who will arrive in Shanghai today, He Pei, Shan Yongli, Wang Jun, and three other representatives from the province arrived in the city by China Airlines plane from Ping on the afternoon of yesterday (3rd). When the reporter met them at the airport, their faces were dark and haggard, their hair was disheveled, and they looked extremely weak and tired. According to them, "The three of us left Changchun on April 17th, disguised as refugees all the way, walking south along the China-Chang Railway. When we crossed the bandit-occupied area, we experienced all kinds of hardships and suffered greatly, which cannot be described in words. After ten days, we finally arrived in Shenyang on the 26th, but our shoes were worn out and our feet were broken, and we were no longer human-like. However, the comfort and joy we felt at that time far outweighed the pain we had suffered." The demonstration of the inherent spirit and perseverance of the compatriots in the Northeast is truly a commendable and moving moment in this conference.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Fate Anecdotes: The World of "White Stripes in the Waves" - The Front Waves Push the Back Waves, Two Pairs of Sisters Emerge - The Fierce Generals Liu, Cai, and Chen - Look Like Three Shadow Boats <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] Yesterday afternoon, the Zhongqing warm water swimming pool became the world of white stripes in the waves. The best male and female swimmers in the country were almost all in the pool.</p>
<p>Looking around, Shanghai, the Philippines, Yue Sui [Guangdong and Guangzhou], Taiwan... and the strongest Hong Kong team, have all come.</p>
<p>The stands were crowded with people. The edge of the pool was buzzing with conversations. Everyone was focused, you watched my posture, I spied on your strength. Nothing else, just wanting to know yourself and your enemy, and win every battle.</p>
<p>The five strong players from the Philippines arrived earlier. They were practicing freestyle, backstroke, and other strokes in the pool, all of which they are good at, and their results are very impressive.</p>
<p>However, they felt that the water temperature and weather in Shanghai were too cold. The usual water temperature in Philippine swimming pools is always around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The warm water pool in Zhongqing is only 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>It is expected that the water temperature of the swimming pool in this conference will not be higher than the water temperature in Zhongqing, so they are worried that their results will not be as ideal.</p>
<p>Looking at the highest swimming records created by overseas Chinese in the Philippines eight years ago, the freestyle 50 meters is 27.8 seconds, the 100 meters is 62 seconds, the 400 meters is 5 minutes and 32 seconds, the 100-meter backstroke is 1 minute and 19 seconds, and the 200-meter breaststroke is 2 minutes and 58 seconds, almost every item can break the national record.</p>
<p>Around 3 o'clock, the Yue Sui team arrived, and the large Hong Kong team also arrived. The swimming room suddenly became lively.</p>
<p>When meeting with Hong Kong team leader Pan Yongkai and manager Huang Shaoxiong, when talking about Hong Kong's chances of winning, they were all humble and said, "Not necessarily! Not necessarily!"</p>
<p>The most eye-catching in the pool are the two pairs of sisters from Yue Sui and Hong Kong. The Yue Sui sisters are named Zheng Yanying and Zheng Xueying, and the Hong Kong sisters are named Huang Wanzhen and Huang Wansheng.</p>
<p>The Yue Sui Zheng sisters, Yanying is 14 years old and Xueying is 13 years old. They look like young children who are less than five feet tall. They only started training last August, and they were surprisingly successful in the selection competition this year!</p>
<p>Yanying's 100-meter backstroke is 1 minute and 54 seconds, Xueying's 200-meter breaststroke is 3 minutes and 49 seconds, and her 400-meter freestyle is 8 minutes and 32 seconds. Young children have achieved such extraordinary results after short-term training, isn't it a miracle!</p>
<p>The Zheng sisters are from Yanbu Township in Guangdong. There is a small stream opposite their house in their hometown. It was in this small stream that they were trained by their father, creating the only two female swimming representatives for the Yue Sui team to attend this National Games.</p>
<p>Their hometown is quite far from Guangzhou. Their father is in the firecracker business. But after discovering his daughters' talents, he quickly trained them and sent them to Guangzhou to participate in the selection, and the results were as desired.</p>
<p>There are three sisters in their family, the youngest is only twelve years old, and she is also swimming in the stream. In the next National Games, the Yue Sui team will have another female swimming star.</p>
<p>Xu Heng, a famous general who watched them practice swimming in Zhongqing, said: The Zheng sisters, whether from the perspective of posture, speed, age, etc., have a truly remarkable future.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Huang sisters are much more mature in age, figure, and demeanor than the Zheng sisters. Wanzhen is 18 years old and Wansheng is 14 years old. They are tall and graceful, light and agile, with watery eyes that are slightly sunken and bright, with some Western flavor.</p>
<p>Yesterday noon, they arrived in port on the President Cleveland wheel with their mother, He Jialu. As soon as they got off the pier, they followed their mother to Zhongqing to practice, not relaxing for even a bit.</p>
<p>He Jialu is the leader of the Hong Kong women's swimming team. She attributes the achievements of her two children to the father's unremitting training. It is said that they not only practice on-site, but also conduct scientific research based on specialized books on swimming technology from various countries around the world.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a few of the highest records, Wanzhen's freestyle 50 meters is 35.12 seconds, and her 100 meters is 81 seconds. Wansheng's 200-meter breaststroke is 3 minutes and 37 seconds. It seems that this time the national record will be completely broken!</p>
<p>Originally, their home was on the beach in Hong Kong, with a unique environment.</p>
<p>They only officially joined the Hong Kong Lijin team for practice in April last year, and they had been unknown in the past. In October last year, they created several national records at the Liangguang Flood Relief Competition, and two new comets were finally discovered.</p>
<p>The Huang sisters are both studying at St. Stephen's Girls' College in Hong Kong. Wanzhen is in the second year of high school, and Wansheng is in the first year of junior high school.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Jialu said: The children are still young, and it is not yet time to praise them, I hope everyone will give more guidance and supervision, so that they know what to be vigilant about.</p>
<p>Seeing the rise of the two pairs of sisters Zheng and Huang in the South, one cannot help but recall the Yang Xiuqiong and Yang Xiuzhen sisters who dominated the 6th National Games. The waves behind the Yangtze River push the waves ahead, and after all, today's people are better than the ancients, which is gratifying and sighing!</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team's fierce generals Liu Dibing, Cai Liheng, and Chen Zhennan were swimming back and forth in the pool, shoulder to shoulder. They were all freestyle swimmers, and as they swam together, all that could be seen was white waves, like three high-speed mosquito boats.</p>
<p>Liu Dibing, a rising star in short-distance swimming, is participating in the National Games with the ambition to break the record. Watching him paddle vigorously, with his feet beating rhythmically, and his breathing just right, everything is clear and beautiful, and this ambition is likely to be realized.</p>
<p>Chen Zhennan, a veteran of middle-distance swimming, is broad-minded and fat. He has been in the swimming world for more than ten years, and his energy has not diminished. In this session, the freestyle 400-meter and 1500-meter events must belong to Chen, and the record can also be broken.</p>
<p>The cross-sea record maintained by Chen Zhennan in Hong Kong has not yet been broken.</p>
<p>The Yue Sui team feels that the water polo arrangement of the conference is unfair. The winning teams of the first day's games, Shanghai vs. Philippines and Air Force vs. Yue Sui, will be able to play against Hong Kong and Malaysia China respectively on the second day. Hong Kong and Malaysia take advantage, while the Philippines, Air Force, and Yue Sui suffer.</p>

If transportation improves in the future, it may increase this month. As for the coal allocation for private factories, it was not implemented last month due to the lack of coal sources. It will start this month.</p>

<p>The rice market continued to rise yesterday.

<p>[Report from our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Hankou Gold Control Bureau, and Gao Fang, Director of the Guangzhou Gold Control Bureau, arrived in Nanjing together from Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd. They immediately went to the Ministry of Finance to pay their respects to Minister Yu and Zai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department, to report on their work. It is heard that Li and others have come to make recommendations to the Ministry of Finance regarding financial management matters, and they have exchanged views separately in Shanghai. Yu Hongjun, Xu Baiyuan, and others all attended the Kuomintang representatives' political, economic, military, and party affairs review meeting on the 3rd, so they were unable to discuss in detail with them. A meeting of the directors of the various Gold Control Bureaus will be convened within the next day or two to discuss improvements to future gold control work.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Domestic Tea Market Quite Active <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw export merchants' appetites remain mediocre, but cargo owners, feeling that new tea had not yet been harvested and that old tea inventories were sparse, maintained a defensive attitude, and the market remained characterized by limited buying and selling. Transactions were few, and the trend was stable. As for domestic sales, except for Tianjin's demand, which remained weak, sales in other regions continued as before. In particular, local demand for Qimen scented tea and tea dust was strong, unprecedented. Prices were consistently firm. However, new products for this year showed signs of weakness, with multiple drops in price. Furthermore, new Wenzhou red and yellow teas ultimately could not sustain the price and rapidly declined.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Sugar Tightness Remains Unabated <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw the price of rationed sugar increase by 800,000, so the trend was tight, and prices continued to rise. The association's quoted prices for spot goods rose by 3% for Grade 2 coarse white sugar, slightly less than 3% for Grade 4 semi-white sugar, and 5% for Grade 20 medium granulated white sugar, with warehouse warrants fluctuating by 100,000. Immediate delivery for the 18th period of coarse white sugar initially rose by 220,000, then fell back by slightly under 70,000, before rising again by 30,000. Immediate delivery for today initially rose by 50,000, then rose again by 80,000 to 90,000.</p>
<p>Domestic sugar saw prices become tight due to a lack of support from production costs. As green sugar was still relatively cheap compared to Taiwanese goods, the increase was not lagging behind. Shantou granulated sugar rose again by 200,000 to 300,000, Diaozhou green sugar rose by 15%, Xinghua white sugar rose by slightly less than 300,000, Xinghua red sugar rose by 100,000 to 200,000, and Hainan red sugar rose by about 10%.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Can Probability Replace Truth? <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Qian</p>
<p>(1) Theoretical Basis for Probability Replacing Truth</p>
<p>Since modern physics has extensively applied the concept of probability, new questions have arisen in philosophy regarding the issue of truth. These new questions concerning truth do not involve metaphysical speculation about the existence or non-existence of truth, but rather whether we can use the concept of probability to replace the concept of truth, and whether we can use "high probability" and "low probability" to express the truthfulness of actual things. The German philosopher H. Reichenbach (hereinafter referred to as R) stated affirmatively: What we call truth is, in fact, all probability, and what we call error is also all probability. "High probability" is the truth of something, and "low probability" is the error of something. The term truth is a redundant concept in logic. Only probability can be considered the fundamental concept and theoretical basis of human knowledge.</p>
<p>R's concept of truth is representative of the views of some contemporary scientists. The main reason they deny truth as the fundamental concept of human knowledge and propose replacing it with the concept of probability is that modern physics has abandoned the principle of causality as a standard for scientific knowledge, and has applied so-called statistical laws to establish the theoretical basis of modern science. R and others believe that so-called absolute truth in philosophy, while having its wonderful metaphysical theories, can only be explained in science by the principle of causality serving as the theoretical foundation of classical science and having its actual universality. Now that the principle of causality has become invalid due to the establishment of modern physics, then such a concept of truth should naturally change accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Statistical Laws Are Not Mathematical "Probability Laws"</p>
<p>R's view of truth seems to have its reasons and basis on the surface, but it is actually completely wrong. The reasons for their errors can be attributed, first, to their lack of precise understanding of the essence of statistical laws and "probability laws"; and second, to their lack of full understanding of the logical meaning of probabilistic propositions and actual true/false propositions. This is why they believe that statistical laws can eliminate causality and that probabilistic propositions can replace true/false propositions.</p>
<p>We believe that R's mistake regarding the first point stems from the fact that statistical laws are not, in fact, a mathematical "probability law" as R claims, but rather a kind of "imprecise causal law." This point will become clear if we analyze the differences between causal laws and statistical laws. Regarding the differences between causal laws and statistical laws, we can say in principle that the former describes and infers individual relationships between certain actual events, while the latter can only describe and infer collective relationships between certain actual events. For example, we can infer from the pressure exerted on an object to the resistance it should generate, and we can infer from the certain temperature of water to its boiling point. These are all physical phenomena governed by causal laws. However, physical phenomena governed by statistical laws are not like this. Such physical phenomena, for example, using Maxwell's theory, which first applied statistical laws: we can describe the collective activity of molecules using precise causal laws, but the distribution state of molecules within a certain collective of molecules cannot be bound by laws. Similarly, in Schroedinger's quantum mechanics, the radiation part of waves is still governed by collective causal relationships, but the activity of protons and quanta within the collective of wave radiation is completely accidental and chaotic. Therefore, some scientists call causal laws natural laws with "precise causal laws," while statistical laws are natural laws with "imprecise causal laws."</p>
<p>However, if we agree with R's claim and do not view statistical laws as a kind of "imprecise causal law" but as a mathematical "probability law," then the possibility of statistical laws being natural laws is denied. We do not need to discuss the practical application of the concept of probability here. What we must explain is that statistical laws, as a kind of law about reality, are because they also have points that can become laws (such as the collective activity of molecules in Maxwell's theory), and are not established based on purely probabilistic components (such as the molecular distribution state within the collective of molecules in the above theory). Establishing a so-called "probability law" from purely probabilistic components may not be a problem in mathematics, but it is not possible in reality. For example, let us use ABCD to represent several actual events. Based on multiple and repeated observations, we cannot find their individual mutual causal relationships, nor can we prove their collective laws from a certain percentage. In such a situation, we can only say that the occurrence of these events is neither subject to causal laws nor statistical laws, but is completely without laws, and is accidental and chaotic.</p>
<p>However, from a mathematical perspective, the situation is fundamentally different for such accidental ABCD events that are not governed by any law (for example, using dice throwing as a metaphor). In mathematics, probability mathematics tells us that no matter how lawless and accidental an event is, we can still find a way to explain it using so-called "probability laws." We only need to arrange the multiple and repeated observation results obtained from ABCD events into rows and columns using mathematical permutation methods, and then average to determine their "relative frequency" within the entire amount, and then assume the application rules of this "relative frequency" from them. Naturally, the entire amount we propose here is always smaller than the total number of observations imagined. This point is assumed in mathematics using the term Limse, which expresses "the total number of observations grows beyond all limits."</p>
<p>From the above two explanations, we think it should be clear that "probability laws" are possible in mathematics and impossible in reality. In mathematics, we can explain purely accidental events in the form of laws. This is the task and function of "probability laws," and this is the object and purpose of probability mathematics. However, in reality, we can only have two statements about actual events: one is called lawful, which is subject to certain natural laws; and the other is called accidental, which is not subject to any natural laws. We cannot call lawful events accidental, can we? We cannot call accidental events lawful, can we? R and others did not see this point, so they advocated the identity of statistical laws and mathematical "probability laws," not knowing that this is not allowed by fact and is not allowed by logic.

<h3 id="e129">Talking About Synesthesia <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Hao Ran</p>
<p>There are some phenomena in the world that seem very strange at first, but after thinking about them carefully, they become ordinary. Synesthesia is one example.</p>
<p>Synesthesia refers to a situation where one sense has the properties of a completely different sense. For example, some perfectly normal people often hear that tones have colors. Low tones seem dark blue, and high tones seem bright red. Some people even have different color perceptions for each consonant and vowel. Each word seems like a picture. Months may also have different colors. Although colored hearing is the most common, other senses also have the possibility of synesthesia.</p>
<p>In 1669, a famous Danish anatomist, T. Bastholinus, discovered a deaf person who could hear more clearly in sunlight. Even a candle light seemed to help his hearing. The American psychology master James, in his great work "Principles of Psychology," quoted an example encountered by Urbantsclutsch: a visually impaired patient, when colors were too far away to see clearly, if he placed a tuning fork next to his ear, he could see immediately. Recently, a Russian biophysicist, Lazareff, publicly performed a demonstration in which he stepped on the piano pedal and then heavily struck the keys. Then, silently, he turned the lights on and off, and the audience heard the piano emit a fluctuating tone. Clearly, vision and hearing were influencing each other.</p>
<p>Laugfeld tested a person's color perception of musical scales twice, seven years apart, and the results were almost identical. This clearly shows that the matter is not accidental.</p>
<p>Tone Color perception (1905) Color perception (1912)</p>
<p>c Red Red</p>
<p>d Green Green</p>
<p>e Golden Sunshine</p>
<p>f Light Red Light Red</p>
<p>g Blue Blue</p>
<p>a Yellow Yellow</p>
<p>b Bronze Bronze</p>
<p>Darwin's cousin, F. Galton, did a lot of research on synesthesia. He encountered a person who had different color perceptions for each number: 1 was black, 2 was yellow, 3 was brick red, 4 was brownish yellow, 5 was blackish gray, 6 was ocher yellow, 7 was green, 8 was light blue, and 9 was ocher yellow. In addition, numbers and letters may also have different spatial forms, as shown in the figure below:</p>
<p>The above phenomena may seem bizarre, but they are not exceptions. If we want to arrange the north-facing room to be warmer, we will add red to it. If we find the bedroom too hot, we often use blue or violet to decorate it. This shows that we all recognize that color perception and temperature perception are related, although color perception belongs to the scope of vision, and temperature perception belongs to the scope of skin sensation.</p>
<p>We know that up and down belong to the scope of spatial perception, but no one can deny that non-spatial perceptions also have a sense of up and down. For example, for colors, light colors are on top and dark colors are on the bottom; the same is true for weight, light is on top and heavy is on the bottom; the same is true for tones, high frequencies are on top and low frequencies are on the bottom. Smell, taste, cold, and heat can also be divided into up and down. In short, perceptions are not isolated and unrelated. From the perspective of "holistic correlation," perceptions are not lacking in consistency or unity. All perceptions help each other and influence each other. For example, spatial perception depends not only on vision, but also on hearing, touch, and even kinesthetic sense. For example, eye movements, such as the convexity and concavity of the eyeballs, and the convergence of the two eyes, are important clues to spatial perception. We feel that lifting a pound of cotton is much lighter than lifting a pound of iron, which shows how weight is influenced by vision. We see that the rising moon is large, but the moon in the mid-sky is much smaller. This seems to be related to a person's posture. Looking straight ahead and looking up can affect a person's perception. Who has not seen snow white and felt cold, seen reptiles and felt slippery? From the unity of perception, we can not only explain general illusions and hallucinations, but also find a theoretical basis for general perception. In this sense, the synesthesia phenomenon is not only not strange, but also a good example of the consistency of perception.</p>

<p>— Jing Guan</p>
<p>Since the birth of the atomic bomb, practical politicians and scientists have been thinking about how to control it, how to organize international institutions to deal with this murderous weapon, or how to use atomic energy to transform it from a destructive force into a constructive force. We cannot say that these works are not important. But there is even more important work that practical politicians seem to have neglected, and that is the research on "man." The atomic bomb itself is not scary, what is scary is man, the man who uses the atomic bomb, the man with the intention to kill. Without controlling "man" and without trying to eliminate "man"'s intention to kill, the control of the atomic bomb is futile. This point has been seen by Western scholars, so in recent years, research on "man" has been particularly lively. Famous philosophers, such as John Dewey, have a book "Problems of Men," and Cassirer has a book "An Essay on Man." Recently, a group of people in Chicago, USA, discovered from the index of 432 famous books that 51 of the 102 fundamental concepts of Western culture are "man." This proves how much Western scholars pay attention to the problem of "man." In the past, when capitalism prevailed, man was regarded as "Economic Man." When Freud's psychology gained popularity, man was once again regarded as "Tsychological Man." Now, when the ideal of a global family is gradually rising, there are also those who regard man as "World Man." What exactly is "man"? We have uncovered so many secrets of nature, we have many methods to control nature, but have we discovered the secrets of man? Do we have methods to control man? Research on "man" should be the most important research, even more important than research on atomic energy.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Bosanquet on the Imperfect Self <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Ru</p>
<p>Every person is a self. Every self may do bad things, have bad behavior. In other words, there are bad people in the world, which is a fact, not a fantasy. Why do people become bad? This is a very difficult question to answer. Simply put, Bosanquet believes that the reason why people are evil is because we are confined to our limited selves, unable to break through the barriers of our limited selves and become one with heaven and earth, or unite with the absolute. Therefore, our finiteness, and the weakness and powerlessness that arise from this finiteness, can be said to be the root of all evil. But our finiteness is not fixed and immutable; it can be transcended. Because on the one hand, we are finite, and on the other hand, we are also infinite. To put it more clearly, as individual and distinct entities, we are finite; but each of us has an inseparable inner relationship with the universe we are in, and our finiteness is precisely shown by our infiniteness. Therefore, as we communicate with all things and become one, we are infinite. We know that the pursuit of truth and the achievement of morality can expand our self to communicate with external things, to break through our limited shackles, and to unite with the whole. This process from finite to infinite, from individual to the whole, is a process of becoming virtuous and achieving goodness; if we go against this, that is, confined to the self and obstructing communication with others, acting perversely and contrary, we will drift into evil. Bosanquet uses this principle as a standard, and divides the imperfect self into three levels.</p>
<p>(1) The self of animals, that is, the self that lives unconsciously with physical desires without rational awareness. The imperfection of this self is very obvious, but physical needs and desires can make us evil, and can also make us good. In itself, it has no good or evil to speak of. This self is a self without principles, not even qualifying as a human self. His life is like the material of an article, without structure and without contradictions; only in this situation can we not regard it as evil and deny it. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>The humanism advocated by Irving Babbitt is different from humanitarianism and is sharply opposed to romanticism or sentimentalism. It is also very different from naturalism. The difference between humanism and humanitarianism lies in the fact that humanitarianism is an indiscriminate compassion, while humanism is differential, that is, it has degrees of intimacy and estrangement according to the depth of relationships. It can also be called the selection of compassion. One is universal love, and the other is love with measure and distinction. The two are completely different, just like the division between the Confucian and Mohist schools in ancient China. Romanticism originated from Rousseau in France (1712-1778), emphasizing emotion and tending to extremes, using emotion to measure everything, so it is also called sentimentalism. Rousseau did not focus on inner cultivation but wanted to exhaust his energy to advance the progress of the people as his duty. Humanism is different from this, starting from one's own cultivation, taking learning, deep thinking, advancing in virtue, and cultivating one's career as the key, "working inward." Romantics dedicate themselves to the masses or a class, and their disadvantage is that they value the external over the internal. Humanism emphasizes the order of priorities and the importance of deep thinking, seeking harmony between reason and emotion, and striving for completeness in personality. Babbitt believed that life is a comedy for those with clear thinking and a tragedy for those who are emotional. From the second half of the eighteenth century to the present, Western literature, art, education, philosophy, religion, and even politics have been directly and indirectly influenced by the romantic movement. This school's emotional impulses reach a state of frenzy, and the result is often destruction without construction, causing the disintegration of a healthy personality. The advocacy of humanism is to correct the abuses of romanticism. The ideal of humanism is the demeanor of a gentleman. A gentleman has three strengths: mediocrity, sensitivity, and rationality. Mediocrity means self-restraint, moderation, avoiding extremes, integrating all extremes, and grasping the center, so it can tend to the middle path, neither radical nor following blindly. Happiness and dignity both come from being able to control oneself. The opposite of sensitivity is numbness, but it is not about being curious and seeking novelty. The mind is open, able to observe all aspects of a problem, and make careful judgments. Its strength lies in the depth of thought and the excellence of insight. Rationality means conforming to standards. Where should the standards be sought? They should be sought in the great works of great thinkers of the past. The great concepts elucidated in the great works of the past exist beyond time and space. True knowledge and insight are mostly timeless and can serve as a guide for our actions. Therefore, the meaning of rationality is the promotion of ideas and the liberation of the spirit, allowing the mind to gain freedom and not be blinded by momentary impulses. The highest state is to follow one's heart's desires without transgressing the rules. Sensitivity is equivalent to the Chinese character "仁" (benevolence), and rationality is equivalent to the Chinese character "禮" (ritual). Speaking of benevolence, ritual, and mediocrity, using these three to explain the virtue and conduct of a gentleman is closest to Chinese Confucianism. In opposition to humanism, there is also naturalism. This school was influenced by Darwin's theory and flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century (the Victorian era in England). The development of American mechanical civilization and mass production is even greater than in other countries, so most people are dazzled by material prosperity, fascinated by the power of science, and inevitably indifferent to higher cultural values. Romanticism emphasizes emotional function, and naturalism emphasizes mechanical function. Taking them too far is a common disease of modern culture. Babbitt believed that the World War was a natural result of bad ideas since the nineteenth century. Humanism is aimed at this kind of shortcoming and seeks to remedy it. Humanists are incompatible with romanticism but retain their interest in art. The appreciation of natural beauty, such as the natural beauty of mountains and rivers, is very beneficial to humanistic cultivation. Humanists cannot agree with naturalism, but they do not want to abandon the high efficiency of material civilization altogether. In short, the main purpose of humanism is the art of living, striving to achieve a perfect and beautiful state of life in this world. Furthermore, humanists are aware of the scope of their efforts and do not want to encompass everything. Babbitt believed that those who want to encompass everything will end up with nothing. Humanistic efforts are for human affairs. Things below human affairs are governed by the laws of nature, and things above human affairs belong to the realm of religion. Humanism cannot replace science, nor can it replace religion. Humanism has existed since the European Renaissance, but modern humanists must understand the methods and spirit of science and keep up with the times, so it is also called scientific neo-humanism. Babbitt also liked to quote the words of the Englishman Edmund Burke, saying that Western culture is based on two principles: the spirit of religion and the spirit of a gentleman. Humanism is the expression of the spirit of a gentleman.</p>
