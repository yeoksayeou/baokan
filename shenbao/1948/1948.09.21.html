<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕財長王雲五廿日夜車赴滬，定廿二日上午一飛美，出席國際貨幣基金會及國一際復興開發銀行理事會第三屆年會。王氏離京前，曾於廿日晚七時許晋謁總統辭行，就出國參加會議之各項有關問題再作請示。廿日上下午均仍到部辦公。又兪鴻鈞廿日長十時許曾赴財部訪王，談數十分鐘。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕財長王雲五廿日下午五時半在財部高級職員歡送會上致詞時稱：本人此次出國，只是短短的時間離開，蒙各位歡送，實深感謝，今天適爲一財政經濟緊急處分令公布後之週月，幣制改革今已歷一月，檢討過去，我們已感欣慰，人民愛國，擁護政府政策，踴躍將金銀外幣兌換金圓劵，新幣已獲初步成功，惟欲求穩定經濟，不僅是改革幣制，還須平衡預算，管制物價等與之配合，現雖初步成功，仍須再接再區，繼續努力。玉氏繼稱：現正爲執行財經改革之時，財部爲執行機構之一重要部門，同人工作都甚辛苦，本人適於此時出國，實爲不安，但此次國際復與開發銀行理事會，係由中國召集，中國財長爲會議之主席，故不得不參加，此去僅出席會議，兩週之內最多三週即可歸來，離國期間部務由徐次長柏園代理，甚爲欣慰，徐次長爲財經緊急處分令各項方案之參加策劃者，自始至終均與本人共同計劃。渠復爲經濟管制委會秘書長，相信執行本方案時，定能勝任愉快。王氏復贊揚李次長對部務協助之功勞，最後並勉各同人完成改革幣制之任務。廿日歡送會，財部次長以下各司·署長，參事，秘書及帮辦等均出席。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕國際貨幣基金會及國際復興開發銀行理事會第三屆年會，將於本月底在美京舉行，我國代表團除苜席代表財政部長王雲五外，尙有席德懋及宋子良兩人爲代表，顧翊羣·沈元鼎·張悅聯·兪國華及張天澤為顧問，並由張天澤兼任代會議主席將由我國擔任，此為去年九月間第二屆年會在倫敦開會時所推定者，此亦爲王雲五必須親自出席之重要理由。渠今晨對記者稱：「國內的事情多得很，幣制改革以後，許多許多的工作都必須親自或督促處理，但本屆會議輪到我國擔任主席，故我不得不親自出席，但在美逗留的時間不會很長，會議時間爲兩星期，我或者不待會議閉幕就將返國，無論如何，在雙寸節以前一定可以回到南京」。按我國在國際性會議中担任主席，可說是我國之榮譽，也是我國對世界事務之責任，故王部畏必須親自前往參加，蓋該機構第一·第二兩屆年會，由美·英輪値主席，時美財長文森及英財相達爾頓也均親自出席。</p>
<h3 id="c14">我在會中　並無提案 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>本屆年會爲一例會性質，王部長說：「我國在這次會議中並無提案」。本屆會議議程，大槪是討論新會員國之參加問題及國際貨幣基金會興國際復興開發銀行兩機構之一般有關問題。</p>
<p>國際貨幣基金會及國際復興開發銀行兩機構，係卅三年七月一日在美國布里敦森林舉行之「聯合國貨幣金融會議」所決定者，當時世界人士對該會議均寄以最大希望，故羅斯福總統在該會議開幕時致出席四十四國代表書有云：「此次會議乃保證實現有秩序及和諧世界之各種必要辦法中之一重要階段，商業乃自由社會中之生命血液，吾人必須使彼輸血之動脈勿再若以往爲無億義之經濟競爭所造成之人爲壁壘所阻塞，唯有憑藉機動標準，始克將彼動脈提高至可使吾人充分實現未來希望之程度」。但是，上述一兩機構成立三年以來，其一切情形並未如理想，首先最不幸之遭遇，爲世界五强之一之蘇聯尙未參加，其次國際復興開發銀行對會員國之貸款並不能使人滿意，國際貨幣基金會對各國貨幣匯兌之穩定工作，亦未收到預期的效果，各國對美貿易均有一面倒之趨勢。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕財部鹽務總局局長繆秋杰，因有違法凟職貪汚罪嫌，二十日已由財長王雲五下令停職，同時指定常務次長李儻蹔兼代鹽務局長，此項決定係廿日晨王雲五與徐柏園，李儻三人所商定者，當日下午卽行發表。繆秋杰前於廿八年任川康鹽務管理局長時，曾因案經中央公務員懲戒委會議決免職，並停止任用一年，嗣經依法呈准暫緩執行，近又有人向王部長密吿，歷述繆違法凟職及貪汚情事，並有人以「財政部鹽務總局除奸團」名義散發傳單，攻訐繆秋杰貪汚，凟職，違法，擅權，荒淫無度，引用私人等劣蹟，王部長據報後，甚爲注意，已派兩專員進行澈查。財次徐柏園廿日談稱：政府對於鹽務行政決認眞加以整頓，一方面要做到鹽稅涓滴歸公，一方面並節省不必要之開支，俾增加之鹽稅，眞正能充裕國庫收入。</p>
<h3 id="c16">助會員　建設發展 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>國際複興開發銀行之宗旨，在協助會員國領域內之建設與發展，保證或參加私人對外貸款與私人投資，鼓勵國際投資，發展會員國生產資源及協助各會員國之戰時經濟轉為平時經濟，故着重長期貸款，協助產業落後國家之建設與開發。該行全部資金定百億美元，攤派各會員國，其中美國攤額爲卅一億七千五百萬，英國十三億，蘇聯九億，中國六億。</p>
<p>在基金會之基金攤派額愈多愈好，但在國際復興開發銀行之攤派額則越尠越好，前者攤額之大小，決定一國投票權及今後借款數目之多少，但是後者攤派額大，則所冒之風險亦大，故在會議中各國對此項攤派額曾大有爭論，爭論最烈者爲蘇聯，蘇聯在基金會之攤派額，原定爲八億五千萬美元，經蘇代表力爭後，始決定增加至十二億元，較原定額多三億五千萬，但是在國際銀行之資金額攤派時，蘇方不顧其在基金會所攤派之比額，而力求减少，卒至减至九億元，至於我國，基金會之基金攤派額祗有五億五千萬，以與我國人口貿易及資源各方面相比較，均應獲得更大之攤派額，因此，當時我國代表對攤　額即提出保留條件，惟後來爲與友邦百分之百之合作「而作」重大之犧牲，撤回保留條件，但其後國際銀行資金額攤派時，更担任了六億萬元之鉅大數目，反超過我國在基金會所擬派之基金額五千萬美元，此足表示我國對國際事務不惜負担較大之義務。</p>
<h3 id="c17">我可請求　復興貸款 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>國際貨幣基金會基金及國際銀行資金之繳付均以黃金及各會員國之貨幣爲之，國際銀行資金之攤派額我國業已繳付，若果需要向國際銀行借款時，我國已具備此項資格，至我國對國際貨幣基金所攤派之基金額雖尙未緻付，但該項基金所規定繳交之黃金及美元數目不大，我國隨時均可繳付，惟我國前因通貨問題尙待解決，已向國際貨幣基金會申請轉緩我國貨幣之法定評價，該會已同意予我國以「從長計議之時間」，而在比價猶未確定之會員國，得准予延遲繳納攤派額，惟刻下我國通貨業已改革，並獲得理想之成功，在幣制改革前，亦曾通知基金會之常務理事會，並獲其贊同之復函，因此，我國所應繳付之基金額，可以考慮繳付矣。因此，國人所關心我國是否可向國際銀行請求長期復興貸款或者向基金會提出短期穩定幣制之貸款一事，在前者我國具有此項資格，在後者我國可以加以考慮。</p>

<p>——祝聯合國第三屆大會開幕</p>
<p>聯合國第三屆大會於今日午後三時在巴黎夏樂宮開幕了，英國外相貝文美國務卿馬歇爾蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曁我國外長王世杰等，均已率領代表團行抵巴黎，出席今天開幕的聯合國大會，聯合國五十八國的政治外交家，聚首夏樂宮中，濟濟一堂，欲集合大家的智慧，探索出世界和平的前途，誠爲目前國際間的一大盛會。一般觀察家雖預料這次聯合國大會將展開一九四八年最重要的外交戰，東西兩集團均將在這次會議中攤牌；但無論如何，聯合國大會的開幕總帶來無限希望。不要說，一般渴望世界和平的人們，對於聯大的開慕，抱着非常迫切的希望，就是對於聯合國向來缺乏信心的人們，也不能不認爲這次聯大的開幕是世界和平的象徵　人類唯一的希望。</p>
<p>聯合國本來就是一個名詞，也就是世界大小國家爲反抗納粹德國與法西斯日本侵略而結合的一種聯盟，它代表人類的一種希望：有了它，人類才有希望，不僅第二次大戰有必勝的把握，而且各國人民也有永遠和平相處互助合作的機會。所以在大戰最黑暗時期，前綫的士氣和各國國內的民氣也無不靠了這個名稱這一綫希望來維持的。到了一九四五年五月間舊金山會議，聯合國的雛形已成，帶給世人更多的光明，更多的希望，時至今日，我們猶保留着這一段甜蜜的回憶。</p>
<p>但至一九四五年十月廿四日聯合國呱呱墮地之後，一則因先天的不足，另則因後天的失調，三年以來，聯合國的發育成長，處處未能盡合理想。世人對於它的信心與希望，也隨着它的威望消沉而日感動搖。記得一九四六年聯大開會時，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫擅自减少議案，爲任何國際會議所沒有的現象：一九四七年蘇聯外次維辛斯基竟在聯大會塲中，公然指斥美國要人爲「戰爭販子」·使聯合國大會的空氣，頓化祥和爲戾氣；現在大家都在那裏惶惑憂懼，不知蘇聯代表在第三屆大會中將採何種驚人舉動？所以到今日，聯合國的成敗利鈍，竟也成爲世人爭論的焦點了。</p>
<p>我們平心而論，從它的光明面去觀察，在遏去三年之中，聯合國確曾替國際間消滅了不少仇愎，爭議和戰禍，尤其是安全理事會的成功多於失敗，以事實來說，有下列各項：（一）調處荷印衢突，終獲得和平解决，使印尼九千萬人免於戰禍：（二）調處印度印回之爭，使印度及巴基斯坦四億人民免於內戰的浩劫；（三）調停巴勒斯坦阿猶之戰，卒獲雙方接受；（四）伊朗·叙利亞·黎巴嫩問題的解决。此外，關於促進國際經濟的發展，文化的交流，人民間的諒解與合作，也都有相當的成就，是誰也不能否認的。</p>
<p>但從它的陰暗面去觀察，聯合國的前途仍難逃奮國際聯盟消沉的厄運。它受了「否决權」的限制，自始至終，就未能發揮其爲國際組織的功效，遇到有關五强的問題，只要有一强表示異議，行使其所特有的「否决權」，就無法獲得解决了。戰後有許多重要的問題所以遲遲不能解决，其故卽在此。姑以這次聯大的議事日程而論，列入議程的問題，達六十伴之多，其中最重要的問題，都是討論了三年仍未能解决的懸案。例如（一）原子能的國際管制問題；（二）希臘內戰問題；（三）朝鮮的統一問題；（四）否决權的存廢問題。這些懸案能否獲得解決，實在是一個疑問·加以東西雙方的思想不同與利害衢突，冷戰愈演愈烈，對於這些懸案的意見更要紛歧，不啻是南轅北轍，怎能有成立協議的希望呢？</p>
<p>所以，我們展望這次聯大的前途，荆棘叢生，困難重重，業已列入議事日程中的懸案，已足以使聯合國垮台，何况還有其他緊念事件呢？巴勒斯坦問題，姑置不論，僅以柏林事件一項而言，卽足以引起這次聯大的不歡而散。聯合國的生命是脆弱的，決不可再遭遇在風暴雨的打擊，我們願乘聯合國三屆大會開幕之日，掬誠爲各國政治外交家進一言，這次聯大是聯合國成敗存亡的最後關頭，大家均須抓住時機，集合大家的智慧，披荆斬棘，要替聯合國開闢一條康莊大道，杜魯門總統昨已宣佈十月廿四日爲聯合國日，並宣示其擁護聯合國的赤誠：我們但願列强均能相見以誠·泯除猜疑，拋棄利害，在聯合國的利益高於一切的條件下，共謀聯合國的新生。如此，不特可使人類對於聯合國的信心不致動搖，而且世界和平也可透露出曙光來了。目前的國際局勢嚴重，這次聯大開幕能否爲挽回逆流的轉捩點，要看列强政洽外交家有無大智大勇而定了。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕南京大中學生聯誼會以政府此次頒佈財政經濟緊急方案，派蔣經國駐滬督導施行，一月來蔣氏爲管制市塲，查緝不法奸商，以大無畏之精神與惡勢力奮鬥，不辭勞怨，不惜犧牲，至爲欽佩，該會爲擁護此項揹施，除正籌組後援會，以資策進外，並特書就『給蔣經國先生一封公開的信』一份，藉表致敬，全文如次：</p>
<p>經國先生：</p>
<p>在很久以前，你的革命精神卽在我們靑年的內心裏刻下一個很深的印象，這決不是我們虛僞的恭維，而是全國靑年在你平素照顧人民的生活，關心國家的前途，熱忱的看待靑年的事實表現中，所獲得的一致擁護。處在這一個在飚的時代中，多少官僚与政客在憑着權勢愚弄人民，作威作福，多少巨賈豪商在通貨膨脹的時候，剝削人民，發了大財，更有多少靑年男女沉醉在燈紅酒綠裏。相反的，又是到處充滿了饑饉，死亡和恐怖的現象。在如此的矛盾與不平的情况下，惟有你環境愈險惡，你的勇氣愈增長；人民愈痛苦，你與人民愈接近；靑年愈苦悶，你愈是同情靑年；你是我們靑年的燈塔，你照耀着中國的黎明。</p>
<p>政府此次頒佈財政經濟緊急方案，改革幣制，對於國遝的前途與人民的生活關係太重大了。誠如總統所昭示：只許成功，不許失敗！在實施以來短短的一月中，由於全國人民同心同德的擁護，與先生以千鈞之勢，鎭監了全國經濟重心的上海，使全國人民得在安靜中漸漸的渡過了這個難關。眞理告訴我們：誰站在人民的這一方面，人民就會擁護誰。天下再沒有比人民的力量更偉大了。你旣然站在人民的立塲上，為人民切身的利益而奮鬥，人民是一定會擁護孙完成这個偉大的，艱鉅的，劃時代的任務。你是人民的公僕，你是人民的英雄。</p>
<p>然而不可否認的事實，與人民站在相反的一方面的是官僚政客·豪門買辦·奸商巨賈……這許許多多的反動勢力，他們仍埋伏在人民的身邊，準備相機噬食人民，扼死國家的命運。這些吸血虫，旣是當前破壞幣制改革的暗礁，也是實現民生主義的障碍，在這一個緊要關頭，我們謹向先生坦率進言，並願與先生共策進行。</p>
<p>（一）除害務盡，執法如山：這一次幣制改革，不但是爲了安定當前的經濟，而且是實現民生主義的初階，今天多除一分害，民生主義就平實現一天，所以我們主張務本除害必盡，執法如山的決心，來對付奸商巨賈，捉拿老虎，同時拍滅蒼蠅。我們更主張以嚴刑峻法，來裁判這些人民的公敵。</p>
<p>（二）淸算大户，救活窮人：在政府未頒佈財政經濟緊急方案之前，我們的敵人共匪天天在宣傳，我們的政府是在實行「民死主義」。國外的與論也是非常的不利，以爲我們的經濟馬上就會全面崩潰，細想起來過去我們的經濟制度，與惡性通貨膨脹的危機，也實在使人太可怕了，財富集中的大户揮金如土，享用無窮，被剝削的窮人，即連暖身之衣，果腹之糧亦不可得。這一種不平的現象，怎得使人心不變，社會不亂呢？這次的幣制改革雖然嚴格的管制了商塲，限制了物價，停止了通貨膨脹，但是對於以往剝削人民的旣得利益者，以及豪門巨賈的財富，並未能徵用。窮人的生活也未見改善。我們堅決主張去淸算大户財產來救活窮人的生命。曾如先生所說；「寗使一家哭，不使一路哭。」</p>
<p>（三）惟勤惟　，渡過難團：由於通貨膨脹所造成的都市人民的揮霍心理，在今天也必須隨着幣制改革予以糾正。不然無限制的浪費，一定會刺激物價，又會造成供不應求通貨膨脹的現象。尤其是大官要人們的享用，毫不顧忌外匯的流出，與人民的血汗，任性的浪費，這實在是太不合理的現象了，所以我們堅決主張澈底實施配給制度，限制非必需品進口，使有用之物，集中使用，早日完成戡亂，步入建國大道。我們更希望改革經濟，同時改革人心，轉移社會風氣，突破當前之難關，使新中國確能在我們的努力下，茁壯成長起來。</p>
<p>天下無難事，祇　要有決心。先生是我們一向所敬愛的革命導師，今日你旣下了最大的決心負起了經濟改革急先鋒的任務，我們南京千萬顆靑年的心，均向你致敬！我們也決以南京數十萬大中學生無比的羣衆力量作你的後盾。更願意在中國革命的長途上，永遠追隨着先生向前邁進！</p>
<p>秋風多厲，遙祈珍重。並致最敬禮！南京大中學生聯誼會敬上</p>

<p>蔣氏謂，目前世界眼光均集中於巴黎，明日之大會係在貝那多特慘死之暗影下釁行，當前之問題皆係繁多而複雜之國際問題，例如巴勒斯坦問題·朝鮮問題·原子能管制等問題。蔣氏稱，余非悲觀主義者，我人必須了解，面臨聯合國之各種問題之重要性，此項問題原可解決，然必須在全體國家爲共同利益，全力合作時始可解決。蔣氏稱，聯合國雖較前國際聯盟有顯著之進步，但仍有對於亞洲遠東問題欠缺注意之嫌。蔣氏舉例稱，如亞洲在安理會與經社理事會中，目前僅有理事一名。最後蔣氏希望增加亞洲國家參加聯合國之機會，俾將來對於亞洲人民之問題多加注意。</p>

<p>巴勒斯坦停戰和尋出阿刺伯與猶太人間一個永久和平的辦法，已經够麻煩的問題，各代表腦海又加上對以色列的新譴責，格外複雜。爪哇共黨的政變，加重了一般對東南亞叛變及革命的憂慮。十九日晚莫斯科電台發表蘇聯軍隊將自十月中旬起自韓北撤退後，朝鮮問題又見曲折。</p>
<p>下面是已經列入大會議程的重要問題：</p>
<p>原子能　西方强國要求停止原子能委員會辯論，因爲兩年來終和蘇聯之意見相左。他們向大會報吿稱，此種僵局不可能由委員會的性質來解決，這問題已克服蘇聯之反對，交與聯大。</p>
<p>軍縮問題　由於與上面相同，遭遇蘇聯的反對，談判一無成就。西方國家要求聯大暫停討論，直至世界形勢改善時。</p>
<p>希臘　美國將使用壓力，從新控訴南斯拉夫，阿爾巴尼亞和保加利亞援助希臘遊擊隊，西方國家將要求聯合國駐巴爾幹監察委會繼續存在，料必成功。</p>
<p>新會員國　奧·芬·義·葡·及外約但已經獲得安理會中大多數委員國之支持，准允加入聯合國，但是蘇聯使用否決權加以反對。阿根廷曾經建議取消大國對申請入會的否決權，因此聯大單獨進行，承認七個被蘇聯否決的國家的申請。</p>
<p>朝鮮　由於蘇聯的反對和其他的阻撓，聯大上年派遣代表團赴朝鮮，監助選舉和軍備獨立，預料此代表團將向大會提出美佔區中人民選舉之成績良好的報吿，美國亦將要求大會提出更進一步的步驟。</p>
<p>小型大會　蘇聯所反對的小型大會，曾建議延長一年，蘇聯將再予反對，乃屬意中事。一般預料小型大會將繼續存在，以完成諸如否決權等的事情。</p>
<p>西班牙　波蘭曾經提出聯合國採取行動，將弗朗哥逐出西班牙政璮的問題，但是大會已建讓弗朗哥執政一日，西班牙一日不准加入聯合國，此外不致再有更强力的步驟。</p>
<h3 id="c65">南斯拉夫現狀一瞥 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>在共黨情報局發表譴責南斯拉夫共黨聲明以前數星期，美個「生活雜誌」攝影記者聖德爾及通訊員威爾蘭兩人，曾南斯拉夫旅行了三星期。他們的足跡，遍及賽比亞·克勞丁亞及波斯尼亞——海斯考雜那諸州。證之旅途所見，他們深信目前狄托仍爲大部南斯拉夫人民心目中之英雄·除了土地之外，他幾乎已將所有東西變成國家化。而且，不管什麽「新民主」，不「新民主」，狄托所統治的南斯拉夫，依然是一個警察國家。</p>
<p>此外，他們更發現南斯拉夫是一個景色非常秀麗的國家，農民佔全部人口百分之八十，他們都有一小塊屬於自己所有的耕地。狄托爲了首先取得農民的支持，延緩了「農塲集體化」的計劃，並供給農村以大量的播種機與曳引機，欲藉此誘使農民們以其資源置於政府的控制之下。此種關於「農塲國有化」的緩慢措施，招致了共黨情報局激烈的批評。</p>
<p>於推進農塲國有化方面，狄托的發展雖較遲滯，但於城市之中及實業方面的國有化計劃，其發展之迅速，却正與任何史達林主義者所能希望者相等。鐵路·大百貨商店固已收歸國有，即連規棋甚小之零售店，單在貝爾格勒一地，就有一千一百五十家被收歸國有·</p>
<p>戰後復與工作及勞力資源，　為政府　　或控制，政府召集志願人員前往修建公路，同　又命令大批醫生及律師離開城市，走向需要較急之鄕村。</p>
<p>因欲提高工業化五年計劃的標準，狄托不惜抑低人民的生活水準，用以集資向西方購買其需要的機械。不過此所議械雖皆來自西方，但其中一部份印刷機器，在去年一年之中，至少印出了一，六三〇萬本馬克斯及列寗的著作，以及數千萬言痛駡「西方帝國主義」的實傳品。</p>
<p>在旅途中，聖。威兩人更見到數千輔較史達林像尤爲巨大的狄托相片。</p>
<p>今年五月，狄托於克勞丁亞州之州會齊格黎地方，舉行了一個規模浩大的國際展覽會，來會參觀者有三十萬之多，狄托本人雖未參加，但有幾個政府官員到會視察展覽物品。在這一個展覽會中，有幾件事物，充分　　出狄托欲與。西方各國進行貿易的渴望。除了南國本國人民之外，每一個國外人都會覺得這是一個精彩的展覽會。旅館內全部床位均留給外國商人住宿，同時所有一切渠亮嶄新的南國商品，皆印有「僅供出口」的標記。</p>
<p>展覽會的目的，很顯然是旨在促進對西方各國的商業。南國急需西方的機械，他們甚至準備以基本原料及南國名產，來作為交換機模擬代價，同時，為了容易吸引西方人士來南起見，狄托更不惜揭開鐵幕之一角，護照之取得，突趨簡易，限制遊客的食物配給制度，已告廢止，「觀光旅行」非特被准許，而且大受鼓勵及歡迎。這樣就招來了二千個企業家，他們大部皆來西方·接着南國與瑞士·瑞典·義·法·比諸國之間的貿易，也像對挺。奧南國之間的一樣興隆與活躍。（譯自生活雜誌）</p>

<p>徐寄廎戈示　先袪除積習</p>
<p>市參　會劃織長市商會理事長徐寄廎，爲響應蔣總統勤儉建國運動，昨特對中央社記者發表談話稱：勤儉二字，本是我國數千年相傳之美德，這兩個字的涵義，早已家喻戶曉，「勤能補拙，儉以養廉」二語，尤爲良言，這次蔣大總統的廣播詞中，尤其闡發精詳，所指示的十項公約，如能上下一致切實奉行，效果的宏偉，是不待解說的。不過本人覺得國人雖熟知道一運動，對於國家社會以至個人的關係，至深且切，但積習太深，祗知坐而言，不能起而行，以致到今天還須由國家領袖倡導和社會羣衆推動，要倡導和推動獲有效果，首先便要袪除積習，並且使一般人知道這個運動對於目前環境的震要性。</p>
<p>積極的生產　消極的節約</p>
<p>現在對日戰爭固已結束，但是共軍發動的內亂，尙在加　　伐，　待建設的各種事業，因此受到陰礙，國家經濟個形未覓好轉，如果一仍舊言，不目振作，前途危機，何堪設想，所以時至今日，勤儉建國寳已刻不容緩，尤其自政府銳意整頓經濟，頭佈緊急處分令以來，可說已替我們解除了那種惡性循環的一環，爲我們關了一條努力自新的大道，國人極應急起直追，挽回頽風，庶幾政府的努力得到支特，國家的前途得到保障。至於如何將勤儉建國運動與實際生活配合，蔣大總統的十項公約已有極爲周密切實的指標，就我們工商界論，所謂勤就是積極的努力生產，儉就是消極的節省消費，只要我們事事着實，猛晋不懈，相信我們的國家必可因此富强，我們自己亦必受到無上的利益。</p>
<p>吳蘊初談話</p>
<p>全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初，對勤儉建國運動表示極端擁護，昨發表意見稱：官的貧，商的奸，種種罪惡，贊由金錢萬能而起。有了金錢，便能暹其所欲，人人多欲，人人愛金錢，便不惜用欺罔盜竊的手段，以獵取金錢，故欲挽回民族頹風，建立國民道德，必須减少金錢的用途，卽必須消滅奢侈的惡習。而勤儉建國運動，確實是鍼砭時代對症良藥了。</p>

<p>世界基督徒領袖總會遠東理事會主席荆磐石博士，頃對勤儉建國運動發表意見稱：勤儉建國運動是針對一切不勤不儉的人而發。那些驕奢淫佚不動不撿的人，儘管在社會中祗佔少數，但國家民族的基礎，正爲少數人所侵蝕腐爛，多數勤勞大衆是不能加以忽視的。我認爲要使勤儉建國運動推行有效，應當首先做到兩件事：「標榜好人」和「揭發壞人」對於勤奮儉約的人多予名譽上的獎勵，對於奢謀怠惰的人則不但在道義上加以譴責，更予法律的制裁。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　宋炳林</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州十七日航訊〕甘肅地高天乾，旱災頻仍，尤其是河西一帶，全靠祁連山的雪水來灌溉農田，談起河西的水利，遠在漢書之際，便有很好的規模，後來政，經，文化的重心漸向東移，河西因形勢險要，又成了兵家必爭之地，於是天災人禍，粉於沓來，民生塗炭，水利自然也逐漸荒廢。</p>
<p>開發河西水利</p>
<p>民國以來，北伐成功，中央對甘省的水利，頗爲重視。戰時（三十一年）總統巡視西北，對河西水利的開發，尤爲關注，曾命前主席谷正倫氏擬具「甘肅閉發河西水利十年實施計劃」，委託甘肅水利林牧公司代辦，又經過三十三年五中全會「加速完成河西永利」的　決案，又有「甘肅河西水利十二年計劃」的誕生。去年甘肅水利局成立，重新擬定水利工作計劃，荏再七載，無論人事和方案如何的變動，但其目標是一致的，卽「擴大灌溉面積，增加食糧生產，保持現有人口，招徠外來移民」。目前從事河西水利工作的，除甘肅水利局外，中央有河西水利工程總隊（下設六分隊），及甘肅水文總站等機色。</p>
<p>開發河西水利，不外舊渠道的整理，新渠道的增闢以及建築保持水量的水庫等等，不過尙有一先決條件，卽水由祁連山口流出後，不及百里，便滲入沙漠，這廣達兩千萬畝的地形，地下儲水極多，以致耗費甚大的水渠，水庫等，都無能爲力。所以現任甘肅水利局長黃萬里氏去年到河西視察後，決定河西水利六策，最重要的一策，便是如河把地下的水引出地面來濯溉。</p>
<p>地下水溝引法</p>
<p>目前尙未普遍，全世界只有十幾個有記載的地下水工程，德國門興全市用水仰賴地下水，卽採用此法，美洲猶無先例，遠東方面，也只有日領時代台灣一處。這方法需要有兩個條件：一是地下水位高，一是地勢峻陡，據黃萬里說，甘肅河西，是全球地形唯一最適於用這方法的最廣闊地域。</p>
<p>根據此一信念，黃局長認爲要民衆明瞭這「開源之道」，一定先要做個榜樣，於是去年選定了山丹和酒泉，用兩種不同的方法來實騐。黃氏奔走經年，脣焦舌敝，終於向救濟總署請求到手兩部挖泥機，訓練出來五十個工程師（有十個是中華職業學校的學生），向中央和美援會請求撥款，尤其是美援會撥款到西北，還是破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>六月開始動工</p>
<p>一切準備就緖，今年五六月間陸續開工，八月前後農忙，停工一個半月，最近又已經復工了。山丹做了兩個月工。據政府的報告：共用去法幣二三一億元，救濟了不少永昌·民樂的災民。這處工程原擬挖四丈深的截水溝，灌田兩萬畝，但到一丈多深便遇到堅硬的土層，乃將原計劃縮小一倍，工程費也自二萬四千市石小麥的折價，减少到二千五百市石。以工程費和效率來比較，經濟價値確有增加。現在已完工十分之六，十月間水將上田，政府正在籌辦合作農塲，分地給貧民耕種，明年春天，沙磧上便會有潺潺的淸溪流起來了。酒泉邊灣的工程，已完工十分之二，也挖出水來，原計劃灌田六萬畝，據政府公佈已用去法幣四二〇億元，明春能否用水，還要看經費與人力來決定，尙待加倍努力。</p>
<p>泉水汨汨流勇</p>
<p>當廣漠無垠的沙磧上，水從地底下汨汨流出來的時候，當地農民們張大着驚異的眸子，疑心是在做夢，（眞的，當記者初次看到這情形，確也興奮得幾乎流出淚來）。他們說水利工程隊一定有一面仙鏡，能够透視地下，否則，怎麼會知道那裏有水，一挖便會出來呢？黃局長笑着對記者說；「這是包含着土壤學，地質學和水工學等的學術理論根據的。現在鄰縣人民紛紛請求開闢地下水，已決定了布隆吉等五處，我們希望山丹，酒泉這兩處示範工程有了榜樣後，由農民自力辦理，我們只作技術上的指導，這樣才能把新生事業擴大，普遍。」</p>
<p>原來這方法的優點，不僅是簡單而便宜（灌溉每畝地只需工程費一市石小麥，而每畝地每年可生產小麥兩市石以上，錢多用在人工挖溝，農民能自己幹起來，而且工程可視人力財力而擴大或縮小，（山丹便是個好例子），最易見功。</p>
<p>黃萬里氏談片</p>
<p>「所困難的」，黃局長說：「是高深的技術理論，決非一般工程師所能勝任的。</p>
<p>黃氏接着說：「創辦一種新事業，除了科學的理論根據之外，還要詳盡的計劃，然後用雄偉的魄力和毅力來推動，方克成功。</p>
<p>「這世界上僅有的一塊大地，能適用這類地下水工程，河西的土地和人民可以自豪！揭發了這途徑，本工程實騐所得，來闡明新的地下水理論，以貢獻於全世界，這也是中國土地和人民可以自豪的！……」</p>
<p>黃萬里局長是黃炎培先生的長公子，在美國專習水利工程，所以他手下有不少中華職業學校的學生來西北服務。黃氏其人外貌雍容，很像一個銀行家，他認爲水利局不應該只是一個行政機構，而且是一個事業機構。在今年七月廿二日甘省參議會上，他報吿過水利施政報吿後曾說：「水利的目的，是以少量的金錢來換取大量的生產，水利最重要的步驟是設計，如同作戰的參謀業務，如設計完善，卽可成功。」因此人送他一個綽號：「設計專家」，（上年舉辦蘭豐渠模型展覽時，也得到一個「模型專家」的徵號。）</p>

<p>在沙市，只有兩三家不成個樣子的旅館，浴室却一家都沒有，富麗堂皇的飯館，在最繁榮的中山路上找不到一家；以沙市這樣的一個內河商業中心，而消費的地方竟如此之少，這事實說明了沙市的商塲，是整個地建築在農村經濟的上面</p>
<p>沙市的腹地包括了整個鄂中平原，江北的米和江南的棉，是沙市的兩條生命綫。自從大洪山成爲共匪的鄂中基地及李人林部竄入江漢之間後，江北的鄂中，早已是烽烟遍地，一年一度的江汛，今年在張振國專員的星夜督促搶修防範之下，荆江大堤總算沒有出什麼大亂子。反是三月到六月間的連朝霪雨，打擊了秋收。就江陵縣而論二百四十萬畝的田地，淹去了一百七十餘萬畝。大體上說來，今年鄂中的秋收，大概得打個六折。沙市這幾天來，米源由於交通和產量的關係不能旺盛，而宜，漢，湘各帮的客人，又不斷地來沙收購，米價已日趨上漲。所以別看十五圓一石的白粳，或者還能引起下江人的羨慕，實際上敏感的沙市商會，早在一個月以前便商量了限制米糧出口的辦法；而沙市的糧食業也開始對沙市「可能」發生的糧荒而憂慮了！</p>
<p>江南在目前，總還是一片乾凈土，可是戰亂經年，層層的剝削與負担，摧殘了本來就不大健全的農村經濟。少歡人爲了生活，不得不挺而走險，去幹攔路刦搶的生涯，「伏莽滋潛，頗多顧慮」。官方也爲這事實操心。江南幾條不算幹綫的路，通常是不大有人跑的，尤其是商人，以此，雖說今年的棉產沒有受到天災的戕害，然而從全國紡聯會及農林部棉產改進諮委會的聯銜估計報吿中「湖北由於治安關係，今年的產量已將由去年的六百二十四萬一千市祖銳减至一百八十六萬六千市祖」（未錄原文）上看來，對舊曆八月底棉花登塲的時候，其產銷情形，實未可寄予太高度的樂觀，記者抵沙一周中，沙市長絨的市價已由六十餘元跳到九十六元二角，九十六元二角還是當地報紙上公布的價格，實際上當不止此數。這事實也足以使人們想到今年鄂南的棉花，究竟能替沙市添多少生意？—雖然現在還是「靑黃不接」的時候。根據一般估計：</p>
<p>鄂中的平原的米產，除去百分之四十留在當地消費外，其餘的百分之六十全藉沙市向滬·漢吐出去，棉花簡直是全部，本地的消耗極爲有限，在戰前逢到這一年中的「旺月」——古曆八月，江岸碼頭上的米包棉包，堆如山積，招商。大北……的大船，有時無法應付他們裝貨東下的主顧，每條船差不多都要有好多批貨物「退關」，今年米收旣歉，很難有多餘的米裝下去，而棉產却還在不可預測的命運中，自然碼頭上就顯得淸淡了。凉飆旣起，中秋節近，按照十年前的往例，沙市的銀樓布店的門口，該又是張燈結彩，高搭牌樓，來吸引他們來自農村中的「基本顧客」的時節，可是看看今年毫無表情的中山路上，沙市人當然免不了一陣惆悵。</p>
<p>沙市今天做生惹的圈子太小了，漢宜公路被支解，沙市的左右兩隻臂膀無形中截去，長江原是沙市的主要血脈，然而由於軍差過多，三年前政府由重慶還都的盛况又重見於今日的長江上游，漢口以上，三四千噸的船，就像伊莉莎白號一樣地稀罕，在沙市的搭船客，不管是上江下江，等個半個月是通常的事，船上一個舖位，還不是房間，黑市票在兩星期以前就賣到法幣一億五千萬以上，到襄陽的一條幹綫，在兩旁戰雲的籠罩下維持着通車，雖然通車的目的，着重在軍運，不過襄漢（襄陽——漢口）公路旣不通，鄂北的部份物資，還可以藉沙市做個轉運站，冲淡一點沙市的冷寂，這些日子，在沙市西北角的公路上，時常可以看到一車車子的棉花，從襄陽裝到沙市。（這還是過去的存棉，）就事實講，不流暢的交通，也只有配合目前不充實的沙市市塲，假使，把十年前的日子拉回來過，用不着別的因素，單是這可憐的交通，就足够把沙市窒息死了！</p>
<p>交通問題，窒息了沙市市塲，而沙市本身，還有更多的</p>
<p>疑難的雜症阻礙着市塲的發展</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，沙市可以說是敵人在華中的前綫，（雖然前面還有宜昌）而戰爭給沙市的破壞也就不太輕，沙市無數的高大建築物，被炸彈炸燬，中山路上，從崇文路口以西，全成灰燼，直到今天，還祗是若干草屋或破陋的瓦房，縮着頭站在路旁，有幾幢倖存的較大建築，在鐵門上還可以看到一個個的機槍彈眼，這種情形，已造成了房荒的先天因素，而在後天上却因戰事在江漢間無止盡地展開，農村中的人集中到都市，雖說在風聲鶴唳中沙市也不乏逃到漢口或上海的人，但這種人畢竟太少，抵消不了來自廣大的農村中的難民，在先天後天的兩種因素交織下，沙市開始了房荒，照一個月前的「市價一，一間普通的店面，每年的租金是法幣三十億元，合米百石，而且自從房荒開始以後，房主人算盤加精，規定先付租金，一百石米在都市中也許並不是一個難以負担的歡字，可是在沙市這樣的一個內地都市裏，商人對這一筆負担就有考慮的必要，事實上今天在沙市找一間舖面來做營業的，能有幾個有五百石米以上的資本，付去了房金，裝修等費，資本額去了大半，這營業上的做法？知難而退，只有去跑單帮，到華南販些走私貨了。</p>
<p>沙市是一個產地市塲，消費量永遠追不上生產量。</p>
<p>申匯與漢匯也間接地影響到市塲，申匯在最高時能够做到七折甚至六折，而華南賤價的私貨，使內地消費商的目標都移向廣州，畸形的申漢匯率，更受到有力的支持，這裏的上海貨，有時反比上海便宜，就是畸形匯攀的副產品，這種畸形狀態，便宜了內地少數的消費者；而斷傷了大批生產的農人，長此以往，內匯再在這種狀態中發展下去，其結果勢必致影響到農產品的出路；並致刺激銷地的價格。</p>
<p>沙市的煩悶，也許不是短期內可以消除的，在目前整個的態勢下，沙市是華中戰塲的前哨，江防的基地，沙市的這些煩悶，原有其內在的因素，所以沙市任何一個人，他們對於消除這些煩悶的希望，都永遠地寄託在戡亂的成功和經濟的穩定上面。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　桑濬</p>
<p>〔本報開封十五日航訊〕隴海路一進入河南省境，每個外來的旅客都有一個新奇的感覺，河南同胞對黃河竟那樣的敬畏，而又那麼執着！據說：開封曾有一次舉辦</p>
<p>文官考試，在防汎問題的答案下，有一位寫着：第一，應多飼牛羊，期以數年，將水喝盡。第二，盼秦始皇復生，再趕三鞭，將陝晋高山驅來作堤。這也許是個笑話，但河南同胞在治水精神上表現得如此執着，實足令人敬佩。秋汎將臨，黃河的濁浪，整天在堤岸邊呼嘯，堤外的居民仍舊那麼安詳地操作。花園口堵口工程未能合龍前，工程局的朱光彩局長焦急得痛哭失聲，但是有一天，河工們在堤旁發現了一條水蛇，說是金龍四大王出現了，合龍必成。接着萬衆齊心，大家奮勇搶堵，果然立刻完工。這一種執着的純樸的勢勁你說該多可愛！</p>
<p>河南同胞其實不僅對事如此，對人更是如此。劉經扶主豫多年，因爲輿情甚洽，劉太太喜歡將黃河鯉加粉皮辣椒燒來吃，河南人立刻學會了，並且爲它題稱</p>
<p>太太魚，在河南境內任何一家館子裏點菜，你如果要「太太魚」，堂倌就會恭敬地捧了上來。還有匪軍自中原一戰潰敗後，傷兵紛紛運往豫北，沿途沒有醫藥，就呌老百姓用鹽水替他們洗創口，很多傷殘的匪就這樣在途中倒斃了。這印象對於河南人民是不能磨滅的，和幾個農民閒談，他會吿訴你太多的故事：「八路這樣作踐人命眞缺德！」在黃泛區裏，他們指點那些「人海戰術」中遺留下的白骨，「八路那是爺娘養的啊！」不用指導和宣傳，人道主義的意識就使他們肯定匪軍的沒落。</p>
<p>河南人到現在還傳說着匪軍在打仗時的</p>
<p>洩汽狀態遠距離的砲總是打不準，攻開封宋門的時候，許多榴彈砲都要藉機槍掩護，直推到離城根一二百米纔敢拉綫。後來開封城陷了，匪的看家本領都使將出來。街頭上，正轉播匪司令部的廣播，懇切聲明決不擾民，就在這同時，近千名匪却換了百姓裝束，闖入開封最大的天豐麵粉廠。小麥二千八百包麻袋七萬條，麵粉三千餘石，機器數十件，還連同職員的舖蓋行李，門窗板凳，一窩風搶個精光。事後來了個姓陳的縱隊司令，向天豐經理陳序初表示慰問，並且說：貴廠是否需要救濟？陳序初憤慨的回道：不搶就好了，我這五萬億損失諒你也無法救濟！最後，陳要求將他自己逮捕，這縱隊司令大惑不解，陳說：因爲我要見見毛澤東，問他那套「爲人民解放而戰」是如何解釋？</p>
<p>河南人現在在感情上是孤獨的。過重的軍糧負擔，水準下的貧病生活，後方人民很少能理解它，這還算了，使河南人民最難堪的是本省的富戶也在後方遷移，後方究竟如何神秘？最前方不是最安定嗎？他們相信唯有最前方是最可靠的，物價穩定，軍民融合，他們也相信軍事局面不久就可開展。他們希望</p>
<p>軍事局面開展後，政治能確實接防。他們也很原諒地方行政當局的艱苦，在「窮」的環境下來和匪唱對台戲是相當費力的。但是這時代就是什麼都得競賽的時代啊！政治需要競賽，軍事需要競賽。他們說：我們也在和匪區的人民競賽啦！小米沒吃，就吃黑　，衣服沒穿，就赤膊。什麼都拿出來交給政府，匪遲早就要垮下去的！對於這一羣在健旺而又執着的情緒中生活着的同胞，不讓他們在精神上感到孤獨，這是我們的責任！</p>

<p>自由談艾帥拒絕參加總統競選內幕  劉泰　　艾森豪威爾元帥在這次大戰中功綴彪炳，已經成爲全美國唯一能够得到舉國擁戴的人物，許多人都以爲今年美國大選，他是希望最濃的人，然而他竟然堅決拒絕競選，安心做他的哥侖比亞大學的校長了。　　他倒底爲甚麽不惜使無數國人失望，而毅然拒絕參加競選呢？　　這裏是一個答覆。本文的原作者是艾帥的知友却愛而滋（Marq　is　W.Chids），現在哥侖比亞大學講學，他是一個名作家，與艾帥淵源甚深。　　早在一年之前，艾帥尙在參謀總長任內，就常常有許多友好去訪問他。寒暄才過，一談就談到了政治，大家都旁敲側擊問他對競選的意見。艾帥覺得不大高興，他說，「我的老朋友們都這樣，實在有些意外。我吿訴他們無意競選，他們總是不信。看看他們那種笑容就——　　但華府的政客們却仍舊大家掛着那種半信半疑的笑容，他們還是不相信他眞的無意競選。　　去年十二月間，艾帥夫婦參加了一次盛大的宴會。范登堡和塔虎脫也在坐。大家欣然舉杯閒談，艾帥在無意間就談起國內政治的得失。他一開口，慢慢的別人都不談了，大家靜靜聽他。他說，勞資糾紛之多，一大半是因爲雙方都自私自利，不顧大局。他承認通貨膨脹已經到了可怕的程度。他希望資方能以身作則，减少利潤，挽回危局。　　好，所有在塲的政客們一致以爲他要競選了——照他們看，這些話明明是競選人發表施政大網的口氣！　　隔了幾天，突然有一個電台上發表了一篇時事評述，那位廣播評論員說：「可能參加大選的艾森豪威爾將軍發表了制止通貨膨脹的意見，他建議由政府召集全國實業界首腦人物，對他們施以壓力，强迫他們在兩三年內平抑價格，任何利潤皆所不許……艾將軍表示，如實業界不肯合作，則應由議會通過法案，徵收百分之一百的所利得稅，稅款供補貼各公司之用，由政府强迫抑平物價。」　　這當然是歪曲事實，目的是故意使艾帥難堪。那天在塲的兩位記者立刻代爲否認，艾帥自已却並無表示。不想陸軍部忽然到了一位貴客，說，「這種歪曲實在豈有此理。我願書面證明你沒有說過這樣的話。」　　這位貴客是議會中舉足輕重的范登堡。　　然而艾帥却勸他不必如此，主張聽其自然。從此之後，艾帥和范登堡的交情固然深了一層，而艾帥却也明白了共和黨中很有些人在用盡心機的打擊他。　　到了年底，擁護艾帥運動更見熱烈。有一個地位很高的共和黨人親臨促駕，艾帥却說，「我知道你們黨裏不要我。」　　最後，又帥就寫了一封措辭更堅定的信給擁護他的那些人們，明白表示不幹。他說，美國堪膺此任的才智之士不乏其人，本人出身行伍，不能任此重職，美國亦無以一軍人爲總統之需要。　　那時，他接受了哥侖比亞大學校長的職務，可是立刻又謠豚紛起，說大學校長不過是參謀本部到總統府之間的橋梁而已。艾帥却不加理睬。　　共和然方面的戲劇剛唱完，民主黨又來了。　　杜魯門總統聲望衰落是一件無可諱言的事實。民主黨亟欲找一個衆望所歸的人來代替他—艾帥自然是最適宜的人物。所以，他在哥侖比亞大學的校長室剛剛坐定，民主黨裏的貴客又紛至沓來了，至少有八個參議員，六個州長，都曾前來勸進，艾帥的答覆仍舊是一個「否」字。　　事實上民主黨擁護艾帥的人倒確是不少。南方黨員因爲反對杜魯門的民權法案，所以擁護艾帥，但是左翼黨人，新政派，工會領袖等等却也一致表示熱烈支持。祗有民主黨的元老傑姆士·法萊却說，如果杜魯門不肯自動退讓，艾帥是不會出來的。後來艾帥對別人說，他很以法萊之說爲然。　　六月六日，巨意測騐的結果是：民主共和二黨中，最得人心的一個人都是艾帥。艾帥自然看得很淸楚。共和黨裏及杜威派聯合起來再度請艾帥出馬的時候，他不禁一笑。他說，「他們想利用我來爭取勝利—我倒不高興這樣爲人作嫁呢。」他一連發表了兩篇書面聲明，措辭決絕，無可挽回，局面算是澄淸了。　　艾帥的用心是很深沉的。一方面，他覺得站在政治圈外時他的威望更能發生作用。另一方面，以軍人任總統，因難很多，如果整軍經武罷，別人要批評是褊袒軍部；如果故意在軍事方面放鬆，則目前美蘇的關係已是如此緊張，他又如何可以貽誤了大局？艾帥之毅然拒絕競選，這倒是一個基本的原因。傳記  索貝　　據美國國會圖書館統計：世界上有五個人的傳記書最多，計開：　　寫耶穌基督的有五千一百五十二部；莎氏比亞三千一百七十二部；林肯二千三百十九部；華盛頓一千七百五十五部；拿波倫一世也有一千七百三十五部。記葉鞠裳  錢大成　　吳門葉鞠裳（昌熾）所著「藏書紀事詩」，乃藏書家一大掌故，世之治板本學者，不能外此而他求焉。余於去歲在蘇州書坊購得其舊藏「仰視千七百廿九鶴齋叢書」，有「昌熾」「緣督」兩藏印，並有兩長跋。一署「戊子初秋」，一署「光緒丙戌五月廿九日」，自稱棘人，蓋距其母之歿，僅二十餘日耳。檢視鞠裳「緣督廬日記鈔」，丙戌鞠裳卅八歲，戊子則四十歲矣。「仰視千七百廿九鶴齋叢書」爲趙撝叔所刋，鞠裳手跋稱：「撝叔所藏秘册四篋，皆世所未見，謀次第梓之，僅成四集而遽逝；其子又續刻第五集，其目尙撝叔所手定。……」云云。鞠裳此書乃其友某觀察所贈者。光緒乙酉之秋，鞠裳擬赴京師，道出上海，寓集賢里，得其舅氏書，吿以其母病重，倉卒返吳門，北行遂不果。次年，其母卽歿。「緣督廬日記鈔」卷三乙酉，記此事殊缺略，時日亦稍有出入，不知何故。　　鞠裳雖精板本之學，然其家鮮善本。嘗云：「余幼長里閈，寄食東陵，習聞治生之說。雖好書而不能不斷斷論價，精鈔秘槧，交臂失之。每一回思，如象罔之珠，不可再得。八識田中，留一苞糧種子，蓋剗除卅年而未能盡也。嗟何及矣！」鞠裳精於鑒別，何减蕘圃澗賓。乃困於財力，不能悉蓄爲己有，遂坐令好事者捆載以去。百宋千元，僅等過眼之雲煙而已　　與鞠裳並以板本之學稱雄海內者，當推繆藝風。但鞠裳嘗譏藝風具有黎邱之技。所謂黎邱者，「呂氏春秋」稱黎邱之鬼能幻作人形耳。則鞠裳之譏彈藝風，亦已甚矣。藝風晚年恃爲人編目或鑒別善本以自活，鞠裳亦嘗爲劉翰怡校四史，兩人時相見於海上，然何以貌合神離若是？則不可究詰矣。　　鞠裳復精於金石之學，著有「語石」一書，所藏碑帖亦夥，晚年悉以易米。歿於民國丁已，年六十九，無嗣。其日記則王季烈爲之刪輯，其女夫王心葵爲之刊石印。日記中所存晚淸掌故頗不少，惜已刪去其譏彈人物之語，不能稱完璧。幸其手稿已於前歲捐入蘇州省立岡書館，世之治堂故及板本之學者，不難往覩其眞跡也。雲深處的名  白蕉　　題蘭軸　　高陽短筆未能神，向曉心情事已塵，賸積悲凉題畫　，可函涕淚寄伊人。世間何有崢嶸事？酒後還尋寂寞濱。歡息吳天滿風雨，時流自賞玉堂春。　　宵飮　　造我瀘州發王醅，繩繩秋雨賺凉回，虛堂疑是三重好，孤抱揂難百念灰。孺子何曾解酸鼻？干戈從未惜英才！卅年回首渾閒事，平見中流擊楫來。紐約  方虹　　紐約市長威廉·奧杜益管轄下的人民共有八百萬。紐約市內有多於多伯林城人口的愛爾蘭人—計五十萬人，有多於巴勒斯坦人口的猶太人—計二百萬人，有幾乎相等於羅馬城內人口的意大利人—計一百〇九萬五千人。它又有四十一萬二千個波蘭人，五萬七千個捷克人，五萬四千挪威人，五萬三千個希臘人。五十萬的黑人擠進了紐約市。奧杜益市長同時是一枝龐大軍隊的指揮司令—一萬九千個警察，一萬一千個救火員，以及十二萬個其他公務人員　　有一天中，紐約城要用盡十億加侖以上的水，要運進二萬三千五百噸的食物，排除出十億加侖的溝渠汚物和八千噸以上的廢物。在冬天，它每天需要二千萬加侖的燃料油。每天有六百萬市民在它的二百三十七呎長的地道車和電車上往來，有一百五十萬人民在路面上行走，每天有近乎四十萬的商人從長島·新吉賽，和康州的近郊擁進了紐約城—每隔五十秒鐘就有一班火車駛進紐約車站，日夜如此。美國地點  蒼雨　　美國對解決房荒的努力，可從最近公佈的數字中看出。自去年八月到本年三月，共建屋四〇·〇二四所，另有一〇五·七四二所在建迭中。三月份一月，共造九·四五一所　　美國最近各大雜貨店有一種新的設備，就是當主婦買了東西離開店舖之前，要經過紫光照射，使貨品不易損壞。　　據美國敎育部的報吿，美國一七五三家專科學校，共容納學生二百三十三萬餘人，其中退伍軍人學生佔總數的百分之四十八。全國學生最多的五個大學，爲紐約大學（四萬六千人），加利福尼亞大學（四萬三千人），哥倫比亞大學（三萬一千人），明蘇尼達大學（二萬八千人），伊里諾大學（二萬六千人）。筆與硯  尢墨君　　本月（九月）八日本談刊載翼雲先生的「紙與筆」一文，引李石續博物志：「王叡有言，書契以來，便應有筆」，及孔子作孝經，簪縹筆故事，以證筆並非蒙恬發明。按淮南子本經訓云：「倉頡作書鬼夜哭。」作書與「鬼」何涉，而要累得牠們「夜哭」起來？說太神秘，大不可解！漢高誘注云：「鬼或作『兎』，兎恐取毫作筆，害及其軀，故夜哭。此說較爲近情。故倘字是倉頡發明的話，再把「兎夜哭」作旁證，那末倉頡時已經有筆了。又按尙書中候言神龜負圖，周公援筆寫之。神龜負圖怪話，可信與否，另一問題；惟記此事者，設周公時而還無筆，他怎敢用「筆」字？故退一步言，孔子前已經有筆。這梁章鉅在左跡叢談中說得已很明白了，但未說出造筆者誰。按事物紀原載虞舜造筆，以漆書於方簡，不知可信否。　　筆不能離硯，亦像牠不能離紙一樣。紙非蔡倫所造，翼雲先生文中已述及，不再談。硯爲何人所製，那頗可一談。曾國藩求闕齋讀書錄說：「硯一名墨海，黃帝得玉一紐，治爲墨海，篆曰帝鴻氏之硯。」據此，始作硯者爲黃帝，與倉頡恰是同時。至製墨者說是邢夷，見梵天廬業錄。硯據世本說仲由作。是硯至周時始有，不知可信否。　　漢魏間書家輩出，硯最出風頭。當時都用瓦硯，故硯又稱「硯瓦」。唐有鳳池硯，據米元章云，中凹受墨。中凹則亦像瓦，此硯當是石琢。　　考究藏硯者說細潤是硯之德，發墨是硯之才。澄泥細潤而不發墨，有德無才；歙石發墨而不細潤，有才無德；兼之者則爲端石。至於古磚硯，總覺德才俱缺，只好視爲骨董罷了。敎授被摑  頌衢　　據本月九日蘇報載稱，國立河南大學物理系敎授張君，隨校至蘇州後，即到觀前街某飯店，想開一房間，暫作棲身之計。不料該飯店茶役聞張敎授係自河南流亡來蘇，即託辭拒絕，並因一時言語不合，將張敎授掌摑一記，聰說張敎授臉上的紅腫到幾天後尙未褪去！　　大家都知道社會上「只認衣衫不認人」，張敎授刦後餘生，披星戴月而來，必甚狼狽，旅邸茶役，眼睛何等勢利，一聽流亡來蘇，惟恐他付不起房錢，倒還是意料中事。但竟然動手打人，旅館茶役的兇燄未免可怕，而敎授也該够悲哀的了。　　且不談我們所極力模仿中的美國的敎授是怎樣尊嚴，即我國公立大學敎授的支薪和身份也相當於簡任官，且有頗多敎授，以學者身份出任中樞要職，那麼敎授之被打，至低限度也該是受人注意的新聞了罷？然而，我日來所見所聞，大家最關心的仍然是新來蘇州的一位坤伶。對於敎授被打的事情，不但沒有人主持公道，而且根本沒有人談起！想想提倡尊師重道的敎師節，才過了二十天，不禁令人擲筆無言了。社會服務海門縣逃滬難民　籲請當局整頓徴兵手續　　編者先生我們是北沙海門縣流浪來申的一般難民。我們的家鄕並非匪區，確在政府統治之下，我們爲什麽要逃出來呢？因爲從去年八月間起，至今一直要捉壯丁，但從朱聞有滿額的限期，明明滿額了，還是不斷的捉。捉得我們不能在鄉耕種，弄得田荒地白，而捐稅重重，不堪設想，主管者並非捉到一個，就送去組訓，假使托有錢有勢的人設法，（如米數石）就能無事。今天我們並非反對政府徵兵，但爲地方安全着想，及齡壯丁，應徵的徵，不是及齡壯丁，就要給他們安居樂業。記得數月前，報載靑島爲了捉壯丁事，中央曾有命令阻止，爲何我鄕無人制止呢。爲了逃避抓丁，不少靑年迫得逃難，憂急成　致死，幾至不可勝數。我們的苦衷，難以盡述，素知貴報爲人民造福，故敢冒昧懇求，酌予披露，則我們一般難民，感恩不淺矣。敬請公安閘北區海門縣難民（三）百餘人仝上徴求人才　　中華職業敎育社上海職業指導所，近受本市某中學之委託，物色數理化敎員一人，以國內外著名大學數理專科畢業，有五年以上之敎學經驗者爲合格，又浙江某縣立中學，物色高中英語敎員一人，以大學外文系畢業者爲合格，凡願應徵者，請於九月二十日（星期一）下午二時半以前，往雁蕩路八十號該所面洽。　　美藝鑑賞社擬徵求下列人才：（一）美術而長於配色用噴筆作圖，月薪二十圓至六十圓。（二）一般工友練習製作石膏像酬資月薪二十圓至四十圓。（三）高小程度學習製作美術

<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] The battle on the outskirts of Jinan is still fiercely ongoing. The Third Bandit Column attacked our Bofan Mountain, Yuhuang Mountain, and Wangfuzhuang areas. Our army met them head-on with a fierce attack. The fierce battle lasted until last night, with the bandits suffering more than 3,000 casualties, and over 500 bodies left behind (including one bandit regimental commander). The bandits' arrogance was dampened, and they retreated slightly. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.

<h3 id="e2">Song Xilian to Organize Army Corps in Xiangyang: Responsible for Clearing Northern Hubei; Large-Scale Suppression War to Begin in Western Hubei; Sun Zhen to Proceed from Chengdu to Yichang to Oversee Operations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xiangyang, 20th] Reliable sources confirm that Song Xilian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Suppression Headquarters, will soon come here to organize a powerful army corps, responsible for the suppression of northern Hubei. Yang Gancai, commander of a certain army corps currently stationed here, is designated as the deputy commander of the army corps.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The outskirts of Xiangfan are calm. Yang Gancai, commander of the Xiangyang garrison, has great confidence in the safety of Xiangfan. It is too early to say that the highway between Baihe and Laohekou has been cleared. However, the remnants of the bandits on the border between Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei are fleeing to the upper reaches of the Xiang River in western Henan after the National Army recovered Yifan and the forces of Fang Jing from Sichuan and Shaanxi swept northward. The National Army can control them at any time.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] It has been over a month since Xiangyang was recovered, and everything has returned to normal. However, in order to undermine the new currency system, the communist bandits tear up or confiscate all legal tender with a face value of over 500,000 yuan or gold yuan notes held by merchants and civilians passing through the bandit areas, resulting in a shortage of materials here, insufficient circulation of small legal tender, and soaring prices of all goods, which have increased more than four times compared to the time of recovery.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yichang, 20th] The situation in western Hubei is changing, and a large-scale suppression war is about to begin. (1) A crack unit of Yang Gancai's army corps stationed in Xiangfan has been sweeping through Nanzhang in three routes, north and south, for several days, capturing a considerable number of bandits. Its northern wing has reached the vicinity of Cihe Lishan Shop. (2) A crack unit that was recently transferred from central Hubei and stationed in Jingmen arrived in Dangyang on the 19th and will soon take action towards Ju'an. (3) In order to clear the remnants of Huang Dekui's bandits entrenched on the border of the four counties of Jingmen, Dangyang, Nanzhang, and Yuan'an, the Central China Suppression Headquarters has decided to establish a joint defense and suppression department for the four counties of Jing, Dang, Nan, and Yuan, to unify the command of the local armed forces in the four counties and cooperate with the National Army to eliminate the remnants of the bandits. Approximately 2,000 bandits under Li Zhenggan and others, who were originally entrenched in the Jianghan First District, were strongly searched and suppressed by the National Army. After crossing the Xiang River and fleeing west to Herong Town, they were threatened by the garrison troops between Jingmen and Dangyang and have already fled north to Yanchi Temple, north of Jingmen, and crossed the Xiang River back to their old nest in the Dahong Mountains.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 20th] Military news: The bandits who fled to Shiping, Fang County, western Hubei, were counterattacked by local forces and retreated to Baokang.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] After the measures for increasing capital for banks and land development firms were set, banks and land development firms in Chongqing requested the government to reduce the capital amount, citing their inability to raise funds. Xu Kan, while supervising economic control in Chongqing, the Chongqing banks and land development firms made the aforementioned request to Xu. According to Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance acting on behalf of the minister, speaking to reporters on the 20th, the government's measures for increasing capital for banks and land development firms have already been considerably relaxed. If any banks or land development firms request a reduction, the government will definitely not consider it.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Baoding, 20th] The National Army on the Pingbao Line is responding to each other from the north and south to suppress the remnants of the bandits. The National Army in northern Baoding is sweeping the periphery of Xushui, and the National Army going south is searching and suppressing the Seventh Bandit Column on the east side of the Pingbao section in the middle area of Xushui, Rongcheng, and Dingxing.

<h3 id="e12">The 84th Division of the Garrison on the Southwestern Outskirts of Jinan; Wu Huawen's Unit Defects; Most Officers and Soldiers Continue to Fight <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] According to the Ministry of National Defense, Commander Wang Yaowu of Jinan reported that on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, Deputy Division Commander Yang of the 84th Division reported that Division Commander Wu Huawen was colluding with communist bandits and attempting to defect. He immediately summoned him to the headquarters for a face-to-face meeting. At that time, Wu was holding a meeting of officers at the front line. Upon hearing that he was summoned to the headquarters for a meeting, he realized his guilt and immediately led approximately 2,000 officers and soldiers to defect to the bandits. Because most officers and soldiers understood the greater good, they were not deceived by him, and many have automatically returned, including Yang Youbai, commander of the 155th Brigade, and Wang Yucheng and Wang Tongyu, commanders of the regiment, as well as soldiers of over two battalions. The division is still under the command of Deputy Division Commander Yang and continues to fight. Yang Tuan, the regimental commander, has been promoted to the division commander of the 84th Division, and an official order is requested to be issued for the arrest of Wu Huawen.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to reliable military sources: Wu Huawen, who was ordered to defend near Tushan (southeast of Changqing) on the southwestern outskirts of Jinan, was originally a former subordinate of Han Fuqu. He surrendered to the Japanese during the War of Resistance Against Japan and was appointed as a puppet army division commander. After the Japanese surrender, he was once again generously accepted and reorganized by the government. When Hao Pengju defected to the bandits, he conspired with him. During this Jinan outer perimeter battle, he was bewitched by treacherous bandits and led approximately 2,000 of his troops to defect to the bandits. Currently, the National Army on the southwestern outskirts of Jinan continues to fight according to the original plan, and the battlefield is not affected.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu will take the night train to Shanghai on the 20th and is scheduled to fly to the United States on the morning of the 22nd to attend the Third Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Before leaving Beijing, Wang paid respects to the President around 7:00 PM on the 20th to bid farewell and seek further instructions on various related issues for attending the meeting abroad. He still went to the ministry to work on the morning and afternoon of the 20th. Yu Hongjun also visited Wang at the Ministry of Finance for several tens of minutes around 10:00 AM on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu stated at a farewell party for senior officials of the Ministry of Finance at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 20th: I am leaving the country for a short period of time, and I am deeply grateful for everyone's farewell. Today marks the one-month anniversary of the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. The currency reform has been going on for a month. Looking back, we are pleased that the people are patriotic and support the government's policies, actively exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currencies for gold yuan notes. The new currency has achieved initial success. However, in order to achieve economic stability, it is not only necessary to reform the currency system but also to coordinate with balancing the budget and controlling prices. Although initial success has been achieved, we must continue to work hard. Wang continued: Now is the time to implement financial and economic reforms, and the Ministry of Finance is an important department of the implementing agency. My colleagues are working very hard. I am uneasy about leaving the country at this time. However, this International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Board of Directors meeting is convened by China, and the Chinese Minister of Finance is the chairman of the meeting, so I have to participate. This trip is only to attend the meeting, and I will be back within two weeks, or at most three weeks. During my absence, Deputy Minister Xu Baiyuan will act on my behalf. I am very pleased. Deputy Minister Xu is one of the participants in the planning of the various programs of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs, and he has planned with me from beginning to end. He is also the Secretary-General of the Economic Control Commission, and I believe that he will be able to perform this program with great success. Wang also praised Deputy Minister Li for his assistance to the ministry and finally encouraged all his colleagues to complete the task of reforming the currency system. All the chiefs of the various departments and offices of the Ministry of Finance, counselors, secretaries, and assistants attended the farewell party on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Third Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be held in Washington, D.C., at the end of this month. In addition to the chief delegate, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, the Chinese delegation also includes Xi Demao and Song Ziliang as delegates, and Gu Yiqun, Shen Yuanding, Zhang Yuelian, Yu Guohua, and Zhang Tianze as consultants. Zhang Tianze will also serve as the acting chairman of the meeting, which will be assumed by China. This was determined at the Second Annual Meeting held in London in September last year. This is also an important reason why Wang Yunwu must attend in person. He told reporters this morning: "There are so many things at home. After the currency reform, many, many tasks must be handled or supervised personally. However, this year's meeting is our turn to chair, so I have to attend in person. However, my stay in the United States will not be very long. The meeting will last for two weeks, and I may return to China before the meeting closes. In any case, I will definitely be able to return to Nanjing before the Double Ten Festival." It can be said that it is an honor for our country to serve as chairman in international meetings and is also our country's responsibility to world affairs, so Minister Wang must personally participate. Both the first and second annual meetings of the agency were chaired by the United States and the United Kingdom in turn. At that time, US Treasury Secretary Vinson and British Finance Minister Dalton also attended in person.</p>
<h3 id="e14">We Have No Proposals at the Meeting <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>This year's annual meeting is a routine meeting. Minister Wang said: "Our country has no proposals at this meeting." The agenda of this year's meeting will likely be to discuss the issue of new member countries joining and general issues related to the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development were established on July 1, 1944, at the "United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference" held in Bretton Woods, USA. At that time, people around the world placed great hope in the meeting, so President Roosevelt said in a letter to the representatives of 44 countries attending the opening of the conference: "This meeting is an important stage in guaranteeing the realization of the various necessary measures of an orderly and harmonious world. Commerce is the lifeblood of a free society, and we must ensure that the arteries that transport blood are no longer blocked by artificial barriers created by meaningless economic competition as in the past. Only with mobile standards can we raise these arteries to the extent that we can fully realize our future hopes." However, since the establishment of the above-mentioned institutions three years ago, the situation has not been as ideal. The most unfortunate encounter first is that the Soviet Union, one of the five world powers, has not participated. Secondly, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's loans to member countries have not been satisfactory, and the International Monetary Fund's work on stabilizing the exchange rates of various countries has not achieved the expected results. Trade between countries and the United States has been one-sided.</p>
<p>The purpose of the establishment of the International Monetary Fund is to promote international exchange, stabilize and facilitate the development of international trade. If there is an imbalance in international payments, the member country can use the fund to correct it, so it focuses on short-term loans. The total fund of the association is 8.8 billion US dollars, which is paid by the United Nations and its sponsoring countries. The most is the United States, with a total of 750 million, followed by the United Kingdom, 1.3 billion, the Soviet Union, 1.2 billion, China, 540 million, France, 450 million, and India, 400 million.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Li Dang Replaces the Director of the Salt Administration; Miao Qiujie Suspended from Duty Due to Corruption; Finance Minister Wang Appoints Commissioners for a Thorough Investigation <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Miao Qiujie, Director of the Salt Administration under the Ministry of Finance, was ordered to be suspended from duty by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu on the 20th due to suspected illegal dereliction of duty and corruption. At the same time, Standing Deputy Minister Li Dang was designated to temporarily serve concurrently as the Director of the Salt Administration. This decision was made by Wang Yunwu, Xu Baiyuan, and Li Dang on the morning of the 20th and was announced that afternoon. When Miao Qiujie served as the Director of the Sichuan-Kangding Salt Administration in 1939, he was dismissed from his post by the Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee for a case and was suspended from employment for one year. Later, with legal approval, the execution was temporarily suspended. Recently, someone secretly reported to Minister Wang, recounting Miao's illegal dereliction of duty and corruption. Some people also distributed leaflets under the name of the "Anti-Corruption Corps of the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance," attacking Miao Qiujie for corruption, dereliction of duty, illegality, abuse of power, extravagance, and favoritism. After receiving the report, Minister Wang paid close attention and has sent two commissioners for a thorough investigation. Deputy Minister Xu Baiyuan stated on the 20th: The government is determined to earnestly rectify the salt administration. On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that salt taxes are fully collected and, on the other hand, to save unnecessary expenses, so that the increased salt taxes can truly replenish the national treasury revenue.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Assisting Members in Construction and Development <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is to assist member countries in construction and development within their territories, guarantee or participate in private foreign loans and private investments, encourage international investment, develop the productive resources of member countries, and assist member countries in converting their wartime economies into peacetime economies, so it focuses on long-term loans, assisting the construction and development of industrially backward countries. The total capital of the bank is set at 10 billion US dollars, which is allocated to various member countries. Among them, the United States is allocated 3.175 billion, the United Kingdom is allocated 1.3 billion, the Soviet Union is allocated 900 million, and China is allocated 600 million.</p>
<p>The more the fund allocation in the Fund is, the better, but the less the fund allocation in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is, the better. The size of the former's allocation determines a country's voting rights and the amount of borrowing in the future, but the larger the latter's allocation, the greater the risk. Therefore, countries had great disputes over this allocation at the meeting. The most intense dispute was with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's fund allocation in the Fund was originally set at 850 million US dollars. After the Soviet representatives fought hard, it was decided to increase it to 1.2 billion yuan, which is 350 million more than the original amount. However, when allocating the capital amount in the International Bank, the Soviet side disregarded its allocated ratio in the Fund and tried to reduce it, and finally reduced it to 900 million yuan. As for our country, the fund allocation in the Fund is only 550 million. Compared with our country's population, trade, and resources, we should have received a larger allocation. Therefore, our country's representatives at that time put forward reservations on the allocation amount, but later, in order to "cooperate" with friendly countries 100%, we made a major sacrifice and withdrew the reservations, but then we assumed a huge number of 600 million yuan in the capital allocation of the International Bank, which exceeded the fund amount of 50 million US dollars that our country planned to allocate in the Fund. This is enough to show that our country is willing to bear greater obligations for international affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e17">We Can Request Reconstruction Loans <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The payment of the International Monetary Fund's funds and the International Bank's capital are made in gold and the currencies of the member countries. Our country has already paid the allocation of the International Bank's capital. If we need to borrow from the International Bank, our country is qualified for this. Although our country has not yet paid the allocated amount of funds to the International Monetary Fund, the number of gold and US dollars required to be paid is not large, and our country can pay it at any time. However, our country previously applied to the International Monetary Fund for a delay in the statutory valuation of our country's currency because the currency issue was still pending resolution. The association has agreed to give our country "time for long-term consideration," and member countries whose exchange rates have not yet been determined are allowed to postpone the payment of allocations. However, our country's currency has now been reformed and has achieved ideal success. Before the currency reform, we also notified the Board of Governors of the Fund and received its approving reply. Therefore, the amount of funds that our country should pay can be considered for payment. Therefore, the issue that the people of our country are concerned about is whether our country can request a long-term reconstruction loan from the International Bank or propose a short-term loan from the Fund to stabilize the currency system. In the former, our country has this qualification, and in the latter, our country can consider it.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Censure for Leaking the Secret of Currency Reform; The Control Yuan Releases the Review Report; Requesting Penalties for Wang Yunwu, Wang Aotang, and Shen Yunlong <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] After Supervisory Committee members Sun Yulin and Tang Honglie investigated and solved the case of leaking the secret of currency reform and submitted a censure case, the Control Yuan issued a review report on the case on the 20th. The Supervisory Committee members responsible for the review were Chen Fangxian, Zhang Xiulan, and Chen Tingbi. The full text of the review report is as follows:</p>
<p>"After the members of the Committee reviewed the case of dereliction of duty by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, etc., which was censured by Committee members Sun Yulin and Tang Honglie, all agreed that: This time, the various measures of the government's currency reform were all important decisions aimed at addressing the current malpractices. Finance Minister Wang has been diligent in overseeing the matter. However, these national policies are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and how important are they? Secrecy should be strictly maintained beforehand. However, the Minister used people inappropriately, resulting in the leakage of secrets, and it is difficult to absolve him of the responsibility of negligence. Furthermore, Wang Aotang, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, failed to fulfill his supervisory responsibilities beforehand, resulting in illegal trading. He also failed to conduct a thorough investigation afterward, which is a dereliction of duty. The original censure stated that the Minister's supervision was ineffective, his assessment was incomplete, and his employment was inappropriate, which is appropriate. Furthermore, the dereliction of duty by Shen Yunlong, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, is similar to that of Wang Aotang. It is requested that Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Wang Aotang, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Shen Yunlong, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, be transferred to the Executive Yuan for separate penalties."</p>

<p>A high-ranking official from the Ministry of Finance will appear in court on his behalf.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The Kyoto Local Court Prosecutor's Office is actively investigating the case of Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming leaking information about currency reform. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office requesting the interrogation of Tao's wife, Li Guolan, the Kyoto side has recently decided to summon relevant finance officials in charge of the currency reform. The Prosecutor's Office has issued a summons for Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. It is understood that the interrogation may focus on the circumstances surrounding Finance Minister Wang's order for Xu Baiqi to draft the nationwide decree for the three-day closure of all money shops. However, Wang Yunwu left for Shanghai on the evening of the 20th to travel to the United States, so it is possible that another high-ranking official will appear in court on his behalf. Additional news: The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office's reply to the interrogation of Tao Li Guolan has not yet arrived in Kyoto. Upon its arrival, further investigation will be conducted into Tao Qiming's movements before and after his flight to Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The budget estimate for state-owned enterprises has been given to the Legislative Yuan for the budget. The joint review panel of the three committees of the Legislative Yuan-- Budget, Finance, and Economic Resources-- made its final review on the 20th and decided to return it to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting before submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for review. At the secret meeting on the morning of the 20th, chaired by Yin Shuxian, convener of the Budget Committee, with the attendance of more than 30 committee members, each sub-group first reported on the results of their departmental reviews. All agreed that the budget estimate submitted by the Executive Yuan lacked detailed information on the management regulations, business conditions, and development plans of the various state-owned enterprises. The various items of income and expenditure only listed the amounts in figures, and all were compiled in legal tender units before the currency reform, making the review very inconvenient. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to return it to the Executive Yuan. At the end of the meeting, Chen Kewen, Duanmu Jie, Lu Yuwen, and Yin Shuxian were appointed to be responsible for drafting the review report to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan. The report will explain the reasons for returning it to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting, and will also include review opinions, multiple suggestions for future improvements to state-owned enterprises, and a resolution to establish an investigation committee.</p>

<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 20th] After the currency reform, the New Taiwan Dollar shows a tendency to inflate. According to the Bank of Taiwan, the central government will raise the issued amount to 58 billion yuan. Regarding the reserve issue, the Provincial Government previously suggested to the Resources Committee that stocks of Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Paper companies worth 92 million gold yuan be allocated as legal tender reserves. This has been accepted by the boards of directors of both companies. The value of these stocks exceeds twice the amount of New Taiwan Dollars issued, thus strengthening the solvency of the New Taiwan Dollar.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] Stocks of state-run enterprises, including China Textile, China Merchants, and five other entities, are scheduled to go on sale in Kyoto starting the 21st. The sales method is the same as that in Shanghai, with each company entrusting the National Bank to handle it in a coordinated manner, and then the National Bank entrusting the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Land Bank, China Trust Bureau, and Taiwan Provincial Bank to sell them. The stocks printed by each company arrived in Kyoto from Shanghai on the 20th, with a face value of 65 million gold yuan (this is the number allocated for the first phase in Nanjing). Regarding the technical issues of the sale, Yu Zhuangdong, Deputy Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, invited representatives from various entrusted banks to discuss the matter on the morning of the 20th. It was decided to allocate more than 63 million yuan to various banks for sale, with the remaining one million yuan to be temporarily stored in the National Bank at various banks.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, Dispatch of the 20th] The various state-run bank bureaus in Shenyang have recently received an order from the head office to merge in the near future, forming a joint office located within the Central Bank. It is also stipulated that all remittance businesses will henceforth be handled by the National Bank. This is because the previous bank bureaus no longer have any lending, storage, or remittance business to speak of. It is also learned that the offices of the various state-run bank bureaus in Changchun, except for the National Bank, have all been ordered to close.</p>

<p>——Congratulating the Opening of the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly</p>
<p>The Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened at 3:00 PM today at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and our own Foreign Minister Wang Shijie have all led their delegations to Paris to attend today's opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Political diplomats from the 58 member states of the United Nations have gathered at the Palais de Chaillot to pool their wisdom and explore the future of world peace. This is truly a major international event. While observers generally expect this United Nations General Assembly to launch the most important diplomatic battle of 1948, with both the Eastern and Western blocs set to reveal their positions at this meeting, the opening of the United Nations General Assembly nonetheless brings unlimited hope. It goes without saying that those who yearn for world peace hold very urgent hopes for the opening of the General Assembly. Even those who have always lacked confidence in the United Nations cannot help but recognize that the opening of this General Assembly is a symbol of world peace, the only hope for mankind.</p>
<p>The United Nations was originally just a term, a kind of alliance formed by large and small countries to resist the aggression of Nazi Germany and Fascist Japan. It represents a hope for humanity: with it, humanity has the hope of not only having the certainty of winning the Second World War, but also the opportunity for people of all countries to live in peace, mutual assistance, and cooperation forever. Therefore, in the darkest period of the war, the morale of the front lines and the national sentiment of various countries were maintained by this name, this line of hope. At the San Francisco Conference in May 1945, the prototype of the United Nations had already taken shape, bringing more light and hope to the world. Even today, we still retain these sweet memories.</p>
<p>But after the United Nations was born on October 24, 1945, due to both congenital deficiencies and acquired maladjustments, the development and growth of the United Nations have failed to meet expectations in many ways over the past three years. The world's confidence and hope in it have also shaken with the decline of its prestige. I remember that when the United Nations General Assembly convened in 1946, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arbitrarily reduced the agenda, a phenomenon unprecedented in any international conference. In 1947, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky openly denounced prominent American figures as "war mongers" at the United Nations General Assembly, turning the atmosphere of the United Nations General Assembly from peace to hostility. Now everyone is worried and fearful, wondering what kind of shocking actions the Soviet delegation will take at the Third Session of the General Assembly. Therefore, to this day, the success or failure of the United Nations has become the focus of debate in the world.</p>
<p>In our fair opinion, observing from its bright side, in the past three years, the United Nations has indeed eliminated a lot of hatred, disputes, and wars among nations. In particular, the Security Council has been more successful than it has failed. In fact, there are the following items: (1) Mediating the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, ultimately achieving a peaceful resolution, saving 90 million Indonesians from the scourge of war; (2) Mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan, saving 400 million people in India and Pakistan from the catastrophe of civil war; (3) Mediating the Arab-Jewish war in Palestine, and finally obtaining acceptance from both sides; (4) Resolving the Iranian, Syrian, and Lebanese issues. In addition, it has also made considerable achievements in promoting international economic development, cultural exchange, and understanding and cooperation among people, which no one can deny.</p>
<p>But observing from its dark side, the future of the United Nations is still difficult to escape the same fate as the League of Nations. Restricted by the "veto power," it has failed to exert its effectiveness as an international organization from beginning to end. When encountering issues related to the five major powers, as long as one power expresses dissent and exercises its unique "veto power," it cannot be resolved. This is the reason why many important issues have been delayed since the war. Taking the agenda of this General Assembly as an example, there are as many as sixty items on the agenda, and the most important issues are all pending issues that have been discussed for three years without resolution. For example, (1) the issue of international control of atomic energy; (2) the issue of the Greek civil war; (3) the issue of Korean unification; (4) the issue of the existence or abolition of the veto power. Whether these pending issues can be resolved is truly a question. In addition, the different ideologies and conflicting interests of the East and West are intensifying the Cold War, and opinions on these pending issues are even more divergent, no less than going in opposite directions. How can there be hope of reaching an agreement?</p>
<p>Therefore, as we look forward to the future of this General Assembly, thorns and difficulties are everywhere. The pending issues that have already been placed on the agenda are enough to bring down the United Nations, let alone other pressing events? The Palestine issue aside, the Berlin incident alone is enough to cause this General Assembly to end on an unhappy note. The life of the United Nations is fragile and must not encounter the blows of storms and rain again. On the day of the opening of the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly, we sincerely offer a word to the political diplomats of all countries. This General Assembly is the last critical juncture for the success or failure of the United Nations. Everyone must seize the opportunity, gather everyone's wisdom, and forge a smooth path for the United Nations. President Truman has already announced October 24 as United Nations Day and declared his sincere support for the United Nations. We only hope that the great powers can all treat each other with sincerity, eliminate suspicion, abandon interests, and jointly seek the rebirth of the United Nations on the condition that the interests of the United Nations are above all else. In this way, not only can humanity's confidence in the United Nations be prevented from wavering, but world peace can also reveal a glimmer of hope. The current international situation is serious. Whether the opening of this General Assembly can be a turning point to reverse the adverse current depends on whether the political diplomats of the great powers have great wisdom and courage.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Part of Japanese Plundered Property Approved for Return Yesterday by Allied Headquarters; We Request Return of Another Batch of Goods <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, Dispatch of the 20th] Wu Banchen, head of our delegation to Japan for reparations and restitution, told this agency's reporter today that Allied Headquarters has approved the return of plundered property worth US$419,000 to China. Wu also stated that our Restitution Advisory Committee had also submitted a proposal to the Chief of Staff of Allied Headquarters requesting the return of another batch of goods worth US$371,500 to our country. The main items of property approved for return are 818 items such as lathes, screw-making machines, and electric motorcycles, as well as other types of machines worth another US$409,760. This batch of machines was seized from the Northwest Industrial Company run by Chairman Yan of Shanxi during the war. The main items of property proposed for return include 106 items such as lathes, screw-making machines, grinders, drilling machines, and electric motorcycles, as well as many other types of machines worth approximately US$280,410. This batch of machines was seized from the South China Iron Works hosted by former Minister of Communications Zeng Yangfu in Hong Kong. In addition to machines, the property approved for return today also includes 1,000 kilograms of cotton yarn worth US$600, 7,326 kilograms of zinc worth US$1,900, and 40,470 yards of cloth worth US$6,876. Other items of property proposed for return include approximately 4,659 kilograms of lead worth US$2,000, 7,125 kilograms of tin worth US$16,145, 2,011 kilograms of antimony worth US$1,637, and 2,828 kilograms of copper ingots worth US$1,389. In addition, there are three Wright Cyclone aircraft engines and a box of parts, worth approximately US$70,000. Wu said that our naval aviation station in Shanghai requested the return of six of these engines last winter, but only three have been found in Japan. In addition to requesting the return of property, our Restitution Advisory Committee has also submitted a proposal to hand over 96,000 Japanese yen from the "Allied Headquarters Custody Account," because Allied Headquarters has sold 38,876 kilograms of Chinese bristles plundered by the Japanese army. Wu said that Allied Headquarters sold this batch of bristles to the Japanese as fertilizer because it was rapidly decaying.</p>

<p>Deadline Revised to October 19</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The Executive Yuan's Thrift Guidance Committee held its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 20th, chaired by Chairman Gu Zhenggang. After reporting on the establishment of the committee, discussions were held on various principles, such as the committee's work guidelines, the 정리재경급처분령(Emergency Measures for Handling Finance and Economy), methods for regulating finance and strengthening economic controls, and matters related to implementing thrift in the National Construction Through Thrift and Austerity Movement. Opinions were exchanged widely, and it was decided at the meeting that the relevant competent authorities should draft implementation measures for thrift and submit them to the next meeting for discussion. The three points of the implementation measures decided at today's meeting are as follows: (1) Rationalization, ensuring that the drafted measures are reasonable and feasible, and that anything that cannot be done should not be included in order to maintain the government's credibility. (2) Fairness. (3) Starting with oneself, such as restrictions on the use of stationery, cars, water, and electricity by government agencies. The measures for saving gasoline and reducing cars submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation were also revised and passed, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation (the contents of the measures can be found on page 2 of this newspaper on the 17th).

<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch of the 20th] Due to the long-term disruption of transportation in Baoding, stocks of various goods are extremely scarce. Moreover, the blockade of materials in the bandit-controlled areas has caused flour to often exceed the price limit of 9.7 yuan, and the prices of various goods are also rising. The local authorities have not strictly implemented economic measures. Merchants treat price limits as a paper exercise, either hoarding and refusing to sell, or openly raising prices arbitrarily. The common people are complaining bitterly, and all hope that the higher-level authorities will effectively supervise and urge the local authorities in Baoding.</p>

Zhang praised Tianjin's controls as better than those in major cities across the country, with general prices often lower than those on August 19. Regarding the case of Wang Fanwu, a senior employee of Tianjin China Textile Company, and his private Ruifeng Firm hoarding yarn and bristles, Mayor Du has been ordered to deal with it severely, and to investigate the so-called incorrect price tags and distribution situation. Zhang believes that the company's distribution should be more transparent. Regarding the food problem in Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei, Zhang has drafted a specific plan and submitted it to the central government. He advocates that the rationing system should be expanded and improved to reduce intermediate exploitation.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the economic inspection in Beiping, the police局(Bureau) has been working overnight, and the accurate statistics have not yet been released.

<p>Transactions are Slow Due to Frozen Prices</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 20th] This year's Shaanxi cotton has gradually entered the market. The quality and color are excellent, but the yield per unit is worse than in previous years. However, due to the increased cotton field area, the total output is still over one million dan. Since the price freeze, transactions have been slow. Cotton farmers, considering costs, are unwilling to sell in large quantities, only exchanging small amounts of cotton for wheat, at a rate of six dou of wheat for every ten jin of cotton. Yesterday and today, the rate has weakened, with only four shi and eight sheng of wheat obtainable. Various counties hope the authorities will revise the cotton price to make it reasonable. China Textile and other yarn mills have not been able to purchase in large quantities due to price concerns and are currently taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Nanjing College and University Students' Association: An Open Letter to Chiang Ching-kuo, Offering Three Points of Advice Frankly <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] The Nanjing College and University Students' Association believes that the government's recent promulgation of the emergency financial and economic plan and the assignment of Chiang Ching-kuo to Shanghai to supervise its implementation shows that for the past month, Mr. Chiang has been fighting against evil forces with a spirit of great fearlessness to control the market and investigate illegal merchants, without complaint or sacrifice, which is admirable. To support this measure, in addition to organizing a support association to promote it, the association has specially written an "Open Letter to Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo" to express its respect. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Ching-kuo:</p>
<p>Long ago, your revolutionary spirit left a deep impression on the hearts of us young people. This is by no means a false compliment, but rather the unanimous support gained by young people across the country in your usual care for the lives of the people, concern for the future of the country, and enthusiastic attitude towards the facts of youth. In this turbulent era, how many bureaucrats and politicians are fooling the people with their power, acting like bullies, how many wealthy merchants are exploiting the people and making a fortune during inflation, and how many young men and women are indulging in a life of luxury. Conversely, there is everywhere full of famine, death, and terror. In such contradictory and unfair circumstances, only you grow more courageous as the environment becomes more dangerous; the more the people suffer, the closer you get to the people; the more frustrated the youth, the more you sympathize with the youth; you are the lighthouse of our youth, you illuminate the dawn of China.</p>
<p>The government's recent promulgation of the emergency financial and economic plan and reform of the currency system is of great importance to the future of the country and the lives of the people. As the President has indicated: only success is allowed, failure is not allowed! In the short month since its implementation, thanks to the unanimous support of the people across the country, and Mr. Chiang's efforts with great momentum to stabilize Shanghai, the economic center of the country, the people across the country have gradually overcome this difficult time in peace. Truth tells us: whoever stands on the side of the people, the people will support. There is no power in the world greater than the power of the people. Since you stand on the side of the people and fight for the vital interests of the people, the people will certainly support you in completing this great, arduous, and epoch-making task. You are the servant of the people, you are the hero of the people.</p>
<p>However, the undeniable facts and those standing on the opposite side of the people are bureaucratic politicians, comprador merchants, profiteers, and wealthy merchants… these many reactionary forces are still lurking around the people, ready to seize the opportunity to devour the people and strangle the fate of the country. These bloodsuckers are not only the hidden reefs that are currently undermining currency reform, but also obstacles to the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood. At this critical moment, we would like to offer frank advice to Mr. Chiang and are willing to work with Mr. Chiang to promote progress.</p>
<p>(1) Eliminate evils thoroughly and enforce the law like a mountain: This currency reform is not only to stabilize the current economy, but also the first step in realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. The more harm is eliminated today, the sooner the Principle of People's Livelihood will be realized. Therefore, we advocate a firm determination to eliminate evils thoroughly and enforce the law like a mountain to deal with profiteers and wealthy merchants, capture tigers, and swat flies. We also advocate using severe laws to judge these public enemies of the people.</p>
<p>(2) Liquidate the wealthy and save the poor: Before the government promulgated the emergency financial and economic plan, our enemies, the communists, were constantly publicizing that our government was implementing "people's death-ism." Overseas public opinion was also very unfavorable, thinking that our economy would soon collapse completely. Thinking back, our past economic system and the crisis of malignant inflation were indeed too terrible. The wealthy people who concentrated wealth spent money like water and enjoyed endless pleasures, while the exploited poor could not even get clothes to keep warm or food to fill their stomachs. How can such an unfair phenomenon not make people's hearts change and society be in chaos? Although this currency reform has strictly controlled the market, restricted prices, and stopped inflation, it has not requisitioned the wealth of those who have already benefited from exploiting the people in the past, nor the wealth of wealthy merchants. The lives of the poor have not improved. We firmly advocate liquidating the property of the wealthy to save the lives of the poor. As Mr. Chiang said, "Better to have one family cry than a whole road cry."</p>
<p>(3) Diligence and thrift are the only way to overcome difficulties: The wasteful psychology of the urban people caused by inflation must also be corrected today with currency reform. Otherwise, unlimited waste will definitely stimulate prices and cause a phenomenon of inflation where supply cannot meet demand. In particular, the enjoyment of high-ranking officials and dignitaries, regardless of the outflow of foreign exchange and the blood and sweat of the people, and willful waste, is really an unreasonable phenomenon. Therefore, we firmly advocate the thorough implementation of the rationing system, restricting the import of non-essential goods, so that useful things can be used in a concentrated manner, and the suppression of the rebellion can be completed as soon as possible, and we can embark on the road of national construction. We also hope to reform the economy and reform people's hearts at the same time, change social customs, break through the current difficulties, and make the new China grow strong under our efforts.</p>
<p>Nothing is difficult in the world, as long as there is determination. Mr. Chiang is our respected revolutionary mentor. Today, since you have made the greatest determination to shoulder the task of being a pioneer in economic reform, the hearts of thousands of young people in Nanjing pay tribute to you! We are also determined to use the unparalleled mass power of hundreds of thousands of college and university students in Nanjing as your backing. We are even more willing to follow Mr. Chiang forever on the long road of the Chinese revolution!</p>
<p>Autumn winds are strong, I wish you well. And offer the most respectful greetings! Nanjing College and University Students' Association</p>

<p>[News Report] London, 20th: Broadcast from Paris: US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin have both arrived in Paris to attend the opening ceremony of the UN General Assembly on the 21st. It is expected that after consultations between the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, the Berlin crisis may be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. Both Bevin and Marshall have German issue follow-ups. General Clay, the US military governor of Berlin, will fly to Paris to report to Marshall.</p>
<p>[News Report] Paris, 20th: Broadcast: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived here today to attend the UN General Assembly. It is said that the purpose of his visit is to consolidate peace, and he is not pessimistic about the future.</p>
<p>[News Report] Paris, 20th: Broadcast: Marshall is scheduled to hold a special meeting with the British and French Foreign Ministers today to decide to give up direct</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrived at Le Bourget Airport in Paris by plane this morning from Brussels.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] US Secretary of State Marshall arrived in Paris today on a special "Independence" aircraft. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and McNair Clause also arrived by train minutes after Marshall's arrival. The Western Three Groups intend to take this opportunity to hold emergency consultations on the deadlock with the Soviet Union. Marshall and Bevin will consult with French Foreign Minister Schuman this afternoon on a joint plan of action on the Berlin issue. This may be an appeal to the United Nations, which will condemn the Soviet Union for violating the charter. According to a Moscow dispatch, the Kremlin talks have broken down, and US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and British Envoy Roberts have been summoned to Paris from Moscow via Berlin tomorrow. State Department Soviet expert Bohlen arrived here on the same plane as Marshall. British Ambassador Douglas also flew in from London. The three foreign ministers are expected to summon military commanders stationed in Germany to Paris to participate in the most important Western Three-Power Conference since the war. Bevin and Marshall looked tense and went to their respective embassies as soon as they got off the train. The two immediately consulted with the highest representatives and advisors and prepared to visit Schuman according to convention. It is believed that the three foreign ministers will determine the time and place of the first meeting. The summoning of the three countries' envoys to the Soviet Union and commanders in Germany to Paris is tantamount to erecting a monument to mourn the Kremlin talks. Every United Nations representative is invigorated, so that they can perform in this year's General Assembly "Battle of Berlin." The Soviet Union had expected this long ago, so it has formally declared that the Berlin crisis is not within the power of the United Nations.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] When asked about the Moscow talks, a British Foreign Office spokesman said, "I cannot confirm that the talks have broken down, and I cannot say what the second step is." The spokesman confirmed that British Envoy Roberts will fly to Paris on the 21st, but added: "This does not mean that the recall of Roberts has been finalized." Strang, the head of the German Department of the Foreign Office, has flown to Paris today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Today, delegations from several countries arrived in Paris. The Polish delegation, led by Modlavsky, and the Yugoslav delegation, led by Kahar, arrived in Paris this morning. In addition, the Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister King, arrived in Le Havre today and transferred to Paris by train.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Chiang Ting-fu Broadcasts to the Country, Hoping That This Meeting Will Strengthen the Power of the United Nations and That Asian Countries Can Get More Opportunities to Participate in Activities <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] On the eve of the UN General Assembly, Chiang Ting-fu, our country's permanent representative to the United Nations, broadcast a speech from here, stating that the Chinese delegation's attendance at the Paris UN General Assembly has two important hopes: (1) that this meeting of the UN General Assembly can strengthen the power of the United Nations and make it the highest body for protecting the peaceful world; (2) that Asian and Far Eastern member states can get more opportunities to participate in UN activities.</p>
<p>Chiang said that the eyes of the world are currently focused on Paris. Tomorrow's conference will be held in the shadow of Bernadotte's tragic death. The current problems are numerous and complex international issues, such as the Palestine issue, the Korean issue, and the control of atomic energy. Chiang said, "I am not a pessimist. We must understand the importance of the various problems facing the United Nations. These problems can be solved, but only when all countries cooperate fully for common interests." Chiang said that although the United Nations is a significant improvement over the previous League of Nations, it still tends to lack attention to Asian and Far Eastern issues. Chiang cited examples, such as Asia currently having only one director in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. Finally, Chiang hopes to increase the opportunities for Asian countries to participate in the United Nations, so that more attention will be paid to the problems of the Asian people in the future.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 20th] British Deputy Foreign Minister Mayhew told the Lower House today that the UK's attitude towards Spain remains unchanged. Conservative Party member Lindsay asked Mayhew, "Regardless of how unfavorable the Franco government was to the Allies during the war, is it not a fact that the Spanish government has always prevented the spread of communism?" Mayhew replied, "The Spanish government has been in cahoots with fascism for too long, and we have nothing in common with it. The Franco government is a weakness of Western democracy."</p>

We must wait quietly for these events to be presented one by one. In the next few weeks, the world's attention will be focused on Paris, and I sincerely hope that the discussions there can lead to a more peaceful world. But just having hope is not enough, and we must use our intelligence a lot. We will do our best to win an agreement that meets the general interests of the world, which is also in our interest."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th, United Press] Moscow Radio recently condemned Sweden for entering into a secret treaty with the United States for broad cooperation between the two countries when war looms or is threatened. Moscow Radio broadcast that the above-mentioned secret treaty is a supplement to the so-called bilateral agreements concluded under the Marshall Plan.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th, United Press] Marshall said at a press conference here that the US does not intend to withdraw its troops from South Korea while the United Nations is considering the fate of the countries that have been at war in the Pacific.

He did not comment on the report by Moscow Radio that the Soviet Union will withdraw its occupying forces from North Korea on New Year's Day next year and hopes that the United States will do the same in South Korea. However, according to well-informed officials, they believe that this announcement by Moscow is another propaganda action by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It was also pointed out that about a year ago, Moscow made the same announcement and set a deadline of January 1, 1948, for complete withdrawal, but the Red Army is still stationed in North Korea.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 19th] Political circles here say that the arrival of several anti-communist leaders from Central Europe, such as Hungary's Naji, in Turkey has led many to suspect that some exiled political leaders will use Turkey as a springboard to resist their respective communist governments. However, the Turkish government's communique has clearly stated its determination to maintain good relations with Central and Eastern European countries. Political circles said, "Turkey does not want to become an outpost for various anti-communist parties to resist the governments of Eastern Europe."</p>

<p>[United Press Paris, 20th] Fifty-eight countries, large and small, from around the world will gather in one room on the 21st to attend the opening ceremony of the UN General Assembly. This conference will proceed under an atmosphere of increasingly worsening mutual recriminations between East and West. The backdrop of the conference is marred by the newly painted stains of murder and disturbance, contrary to its original purpose.</p>
<p>The assassination of Count Bernadotte, the UN mediator for the Palestine dispute, the activities of the Javanese Communists, coupled with the Berlin crisis, the deadlock on the Korean issue, the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, and the situation in the Balkans, will cause headaches for the world's diplomatic community.</p>
<p>The Palestine armistice and finding a permanent peace between Arabs and Jews is already a troublesome problem, but the new condemnations of Israel in the minds of the representatives make it even more complex. The coup by the Javanese Communists has heightened general concerns about rebellions and revolutions in Southeast Asia. After Moscow Radio announced on the evening of the 19th that Soviet troops would withdraw from North Korea starting in mid-October, the Korean issue took another turn.</p>
<p>The following are important issues already included in the General Assembly's agenda:</p>
<p>Atomic Energy: Western powers are demanding a halt to the Atomic Energy Commission's debate, as they have been in disagreement with the Soviet Union for two years. They are reporting to the General Assembly that this deadlock cannot be resolved by the nature of the committee, and this issue has been submitted to the General Assembly, overcoming Soviet opposition.</p>
<p>Disarmament: Due to the same reasons as above, facing Soviet opposition, negotiations have been fruitless. Western countries are asking the General Assembly to suspend discussions until the world situation improves.</p>
<p>Greece: The United States will use pressure to renew accusations against Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria for aiding Greek guerrillas. Western countries will request the continued existence of the UN Balkan Observation Commission and are expected to succeed.</p>
<p>New Member States: Austria, Finland, Italy, Portugal, and Transjordan have already gained the support of a majority of member states in the Security Council for admission to the UN, but the Soviet Union used its veto power to oppose them. Argentina has suggested abolishing the veto power of major powers on applications for membership, so the General Assembly may proceed independently to recognize the applications of the seven countries vetoed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Korea: Due to Soviet opposition and other obstructions, the General Assembly last year sent a delegation to Korea to monitor elections and independence. It is expected that this delegation will submit a report to the General Assembly on the successful elections in the US-occupied zone, and the United States will also request the General Assembly to propose further steps.</p>
<p>Little Assembly: The Little Assembly, which the Soviet Union opposes, has been recommended for a one-year extension. It is a foregone conclusion that the Soviet Union will oppose it again. It is generally expected that the Little Assembly will continue to exist to complete tasks such as dealing with the veto power.</p>
<p>Spain: Poland has proposed that the United Nations take action to remove Franco from the Spanish political arena, but the General Assembly has allowed Franco to remain in power. As long as Franco is in power, Spain will not be allowed to join the United Nations, but there will be no stronger measures taken.</p>
<h3 id="e65">A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Yugoslavia <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by the Newsroom of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Several weeks before the Communist Information Bureau issued a statement condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party, two individuals, a photographer named Standel and a correspondent named Weiland from "Life Magazine," traveled through Yugoslavia for three weeks. Their footsteps covered the states of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Based on what they saw during their journey, they firmly believe that Tito is still a hero in the eyes of most Yugoslavs. Apart from land, he has nationalized almost everything. Moreover, regardless of whether it is a "new democracy" or not, Yugoslavia under Tito's rule remains a police state.</p>
<p>In addition, they discovered that Yugoslavia is a country with very beautiful scenery, where farmers make up 80% of the total population, and they all have a small piece of land that belongs to them. In order to gain the support of the farmers first, Tito delayed the "collectivization of agriculture" plan and supplied the countryside with a large number of seeders and tractors, intending to entice the farmers to place their resources under the government's control. This slow approach to "nationalizing agriculture" has drawn fierce criticism from the Communist Information Bureau.</p>
<p>Although Tito's development in promoting the nationalization of agriculture has been relatively slow, the speed of his nationalization plans in cities and industries is exactly what any Stalinist could hope for. Railways and large department stores have already been nationalized, and even very small retail stores, in Belgrade alone, have had 1,150 of them nationalized.</p>
<p>Post-war reconstruction work and labor resources are all either owned or controlled by the government. The government summons volunteers to build roads, and at the same time, orders a large number of doctors and lawyers to leave the cities and go to the countryside, where there is a greater need.</p>
<p>In order to raise the standards of the industrialization five-year plan, Tito does not hesitate to lower the people's living standards in order to raise funds to purchase the machinery he needs from the West. However, although the machinery discussed comes from the West, at least 16.3 million books by Marx and Lenin, as well as tens of millions of words denouncing "Western imperialism," were printed by some of the printing machines last year alone.</p>
<p>During their journey, Standel and Weiland also saw thousands of photos of Tito, larger than even statues of Stalin.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Tito held a large-scale international exhibition in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, which was visited by as many as 300,000 people. Although Tito himself did not attend, several government officials visited the exhibition. In this exhibition, there were several things that fully demonstrated Tito's desire to trade with Western countries. Apart from the people of Yugoslavia, every foreigner would find this a wonderful exhibition. All the beds in the hotels were reserved for foreign merchants, and all the bright and new Yugoslav goods were marked "For Export Only."</p>
<p>The purpose of the exhibition was obviously to promote commerce with Western countries. Yugoslavia urgently needs Western machinery, and they are even prepared to use basic raw materials and Yugoslav specialties as a means of exchange. At the same time, in order to easily attract Westerners to Yugoslavia, Tito does not hesitate to lift a corner of the Iron Curtain. Obtaining passports has suddenly become easier, and the food rationing system for tourists has been abolished. "Sightseeing tours" are not only permitted but also greatly encouraged and welcomed. This has attracted 2,000 entrepreneurs, most of whom come from the West. Subsequently, trade between Yugoslavia and Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, France, Belgium, and other countries is as prosperous and active as that between Yugoslavia and Austria.

<h3 id="e67">Indonesian Republic Splits Apart, Communist Party Captures Madiun City and Forms Separate Government, President Sukarno Resolves to Quell Rebellion <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 20th] The newly established Indonesian Republic cancelled its constitutional guarantees on the 20th and granted President Sukarno emergency dictatorial powers to quell the Communist Party, which has occupied the important city of Madiun. The Standing Committee of the Indonesian Parliament held an emergency meeting and acknowledged that Indonesia "is facing a crisis situation," as the Communist Party Chairman Muso, who returned from Moscow several months ago, has led a rebellion. Reports from Yogyakarta stated that Muso has been appointed as the President of the Javanese Soviet Republic, and former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir has also joined the rebel party as Prime Minister. After the Yogyakarta radio station reported the Madiun rebellion on the morning of the 19th, it announced that Yogyakarta had begun a large-scale search and arrest of Communists and leftists, and more than 200 people had been detained within the first 24 hours. Soldiers were stationed in the streets, and police patrolled in front of the Shabuk She office of the Communist-controlled union. Under the emergency dictatorial bill, Sukarno has the power to take "actions outside of legal and effective procedures to safeguard national security" for the next three months. The bill was passed by the Standing Committee by a vote of 25 to 1. Prime Minister Hatta attended and spoke, guaranteeing that swift action would be taken to quell the war aimed at overthrowing the government. The Yogyakarta radio station also stated that all leftist newspapers and magazines have been closed down, and the Indonesian Islamic Party, the largest party in Indonesia, has joined the Nationalist Party to form the anti-communist "National Independence Front." The Madiun radio station, under Communist control, simultaneously condemned the Indonesian authorities for handing the country over to the Dutch and referred to the republic as a "fascist state." It also accused Sukarno and Hatta of colluding with Japan during the war and finally announced that the Communist Party's goal was to conquer all of Indonesia, saying that "the time for revolution has begun." A delayed report from Antara news agency acknowledged that the capture of Madiun, as claimed by the Communist Party, was extremely swift and almost bloodless. Antara stated that only two officers were killed and four were injured. It also stated that cars with hammer and sickle flags were traveling throughout the city, and the Communist Party flag was raised on the city hall. Former Indonesian Prime Minister and UN representative Sjahrir declared in Batavia: "Civil war seems to be brewing within the Republic, and it is difficult to say how the situation will develop." A Dutch official military spokesperson told the United Press that "We should face the situation squarely, but at present, we will definitely not intervene. If Communist forces continue to spread, we will have no choice but to take action."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Yogyakarta, 19th] The Republic's public gazette stated that Madiun, a city north of Yogyakarta in central Java, was occupied last night by the Communist Party with the support of some regular Republic troops.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Yogyakarta, 19th] The Indonesian Republican government has appointed General Sun-Konno as the commander-in-chief for the suppression of Communists within the territory of the Republic of Java.</p>

<h3 id="e68">First Public Trial of Rong Hongyuan Case, Admits to Exchange Arbitrage, Claims Not Attempting to Profit, Tang Yao'an Found to Have Committed Other Crimes, Prosecuted and Will Be Summoned for Questioning <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Rong Hongyuan, General Manager of Shen Hsin Textile Company, was prosecuted by the Special Criminal Tribunal for the private foreign exchange arbitrage case. The first public trial was held at the Special Criminal Tribunal at 9:30 am yesterday.</p>
<p>The focus of yesterday's trial was the detailed circumstances of the exchange arbitrage of HK$189,650, equivalent to 41 billion legal tender. According to Rong's testimony: "This matter was decided solely by Chen Yuanzhi, Shen Hsin's representative in Hong Kong. I did not approve of this in the first place, but Chen had already negotiated it, so I had to hand over the 41 billion legal tender to seven collectors including Tang Yao'an in Shanghai. I don't remember where 3 billion of it was delivered, but it can be found by checking the accounts. In short, this exchange arbitrage was for the purpose of purchasing Indian cotton for production. It was an unavoidable measure to maintain commercial credit and was not intended to profit. As for Chen Yuanzhi, Pan Yaowen, an employee of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and Mu Jinzhang, they are probably all in Hong Kong now. Please summon them directly. I cannot be responsible for their actions." The trial ended around 11 am, and Rong Hongyuan was returned to the detention center.</p>
<p>In addition, the examining magistrate discovered from the confession of Tang Yao'an in the case that he is also known as Tang Yunzhong and had previously been prosecuted for disrupting the financial market. He will be summoned for questioning on the 24th in a separate case. Gong Chongrui, Lin Siping, Liang Qianli, Li Shiying, Zhou Defa, Guanghua Company, and others are also deeply involved in the case and will be summoned for questioning separately at a later date.</p>

The measures are as follows: (1) The prices of goods or services provided by public utilities should still be frozen according to the price freeze on August 19th, and the coal needed by public utilities should also still be supplied at the supply price in August. (2) If the price agreed upon for a certain utility was increased significantly before August 19th, adjustments will be allowed in accordance with Articles 2 and 15 of the Measures for Reorganizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control. The competent authorities should supervise the utility to improve management, increase efficiency, reduce waste, strictly verify costs, and propose methods for adjusting prices for approval. The proposed methods should also adopt a tiered pricing system in order to reduce the burden on citizens. (3) The financial management of each public utility should be properly organized, actively collect outstanding payments to maintain self-sufficiency. If necessary, half a month's fee can be pre-collected from users based on the August prices. (4) The prices of various public utilities, transportation utilities, and the oil and coal they need are interrelated. The Executive Yuan will regularly convene relevant agencies for discussions to maintain close coordination and ensure a uniform approach. As for the City Government and the City Council's previous submission requesting the Central Bank to allocate funds to maintain public utilities if prices are not adjusted in August, the Executive Yuan has instructed to handle it in accordance with item (3) above, that is, if necessary, half a month's fee can be pre-collected from users based on the August prices to maintain self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Increase Power Supply by 2,000 Kilowatts to Alleviate Power Shortage in Nanshi, City Government Responds to City Council, Urging Installation of New Equipment <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The electricity supply in Nanshi has been frequently interrupted in recent months, causing great pain to residents. After the City Council resolved to send a letter to the public utility authorities to find ways to improve the situation, the City Government has now responded. According to the response, the main reason for the poor electricity supply in Nanshi is that the power generation equipment of the China Merchant Electric Company, which is responsible for supplying electricity to the area, was dismantled and moved to Shijingshan by the enemy and puppet regime during the occupation and is still being held by the Resources Commission and has not been returned. Currently, the electricity used in the area is purchased from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, so when the equipment of that company malfunctions and reduces power generation, the electricity supply in Nanshi is affected. After the Bureau of Public Utilities convened a meeting of various companies to discuss improvement measures, in addition to increasing the supply from Shanghai Electric Power Company by 2,000 kilowatts in order to alleviate the power shortage in Nanshi, it is also continuing to negotiate with the Resources Commission to expedite the return of the generators of China Merchant Electric Company that were looted by the enemy. At the same time, it is urging the company to speed up the installation of the new 4,000-kilowatt generators purchased from the Executive Yuan in order to actively increase the power supply. It is understood that the above-mentioned new 4,000-kilowatt unit can be installed by the end of the year, and the electricity supply situation in Nanshi will be greatly improved at that time.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The market situation has shown a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply for several days, especially for fish and meat. According to analysis by relevant parties, the reasons are: (1) the demand is too high during the Mid-Autumn Festival, (2) the recent wind and rain affected the source of supply, and (3) vendors are evading price controls. The police bureau also summoned the chairmen of the Fresh Pork Association, Fresh Meat Association, and Pig Trade Association, Xin Xiaokang, Hong Wenjiang, and Zhu Zhigao, to the bureau for questioning. According to them, the supply of fresh pigs has been insufficient recently, resulting in the market not being able to meet the demand. Starting today, about 2,000 fresh pigs can be supplied to the city every day. The police bureau, considering that this matter is related to the daily necessities of 5 million citizens in the city, specifically ordered the persons in charge of each association to guarantee that the above situation would not happen again.</p>
<p>At 10:00 am today, the Bureau of Social Affairs will invite the police bureau, the Bureau of Public Health, and the Bureau of Finance to convene a meeting with the persons in charge of the fresh meat, pig trade, and other industries to discuss the issue of suppressing the black market for pork and unblocking sources of supply.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, accompanied by Deputy Director of the City Police Bureau Zhang Shi, and Chief Secretary Chen Hanping of the Supervisor's Office, personally inspected the Fuzhou Road small vegetable market and cloth market yesterday morning. According to informed sources: the authorities paid close attention to the disappearance of chicken, duck, and fresh meat from the vegetable market yesterday, believing that price controls had been in place for some time and that this incident only happened suddenly yesterday, indicating that someone was manipulating it behind the scenes. Jiang Jingguo and Yu Shuping discussed this yesterday and decided that the police bureau would concentrate all its efforts to resolve the issue within a day or two. The supply of fish and meat in this city should not be a problem. Taking fish as an example, if the Fisheries Administration Bureau sells directly, the supply to the market will be more than sufficient. At the same time, because it can avoid the layers of exploitation by middlemen, the price may be about 50% lower.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mayor Wu recently received an extremely long and strange letter, signed by He Weisen, residing at No. 7, Lane 406, Shanhai Pass Road. The letter stated that since the several major fires at the Yongbei Underwear Factory in Zhabei and in the city, he had invented a fire prevention device with effectiveness surpassing a parachute, and that he could demonstrate it publicly if doubted. However, the letter did not describe the construction of the fire prevention device. Mayor Wu forwarded the letter to the Fire Department of the Police Bureau. The Fire Department summoned He for a test yesterday. He explained that his fire prevention device was very simple: a white cloth is hung down from the third floor. In case of fire, one can climb down the white cloth, avoiding being burned to death, which is better than a parachute, thus escaping danger and death. He hoped that those rescued would give gifts in gratitude for his invention. The Fire Department, seeing that he was of short stature and seemed mentally ill, and that his method was a joke, sent He to the First Division of the Police Department to investigate the reason.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Government Willing to Help Factories Procure Raw Materials <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to a spokesperson from the Economic Control and Supervision Office, the government is clearly assisting factories in procuring raw materials, reducing transportation difficulties for manufacturers. For example, it is not easy for factories to obtain railway cars for transport between Xuzhou and Pukou on their own. Currently, rapeseed, the raw material for cooking oil, is being procured jointly by government and businesses. However, it is feared that it will be difficult to revise the price limits on finished products, as the controlling authorities believe that factories can only plan production if the currency value is stable. Otherwise, manufacturers will hoard raw materials and be unwilling to manufacture, as in the past, and nothing can be discussed. The government is willing to help industrialists solve their difficulties under the principle that price limits will not be changed. For example, the price of white paper has increased by 30 percent, but newspaper companies have not increased the price of newspapers and are still able to maintain operations.</p>

<p>Since the government issued the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures Order, Guo Chan, the Commander-in-Chief of the United Logistics Command, in order to cooperate with the Suppression and Construction efforts, promote government orders, and prevent corruption, strictly ordered all United Logistics agencies nationwide to absolutely comply, without negligence. Factories and warehouses at all levels are not allowed to benefit themselves at public expense, hoard goods for profit, or collude with merchants to evade materials. Those who deliberately violate this order will be severely punished according to law once discovered. Special attention is paid to warehouses in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. In order to implement the order, Major General Deng Weiren, Director of the Inspection Department of the Command, was secretly dispatched, leading more than 20 inspectors, to arrive in Shanghai on the 14th and immediately divide into groups to inspect various military factories, camps, warehouses, and stations. This inspection had the nature of a surprise check. The work was completed on the 19th, and yesterday morning, in the auditorium of the Shanghai Supply Bureau, the heads of all units under the United Logistics Command and all officers of the Supply Bureau were convened to report on the opinions gained from this inspection. Director Deng returned to Nanjing by train last night to report on his mission. It is said that the results of this inspection were very satisfactory. It is rumored that personnel will continue to be dispatched secretly for inspection in the future in order to achieve complete success.</p>

<p>Li Liangrong, the newly appointed Chairman of Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The San Shan, Quanzhang, Xinghua, Jinjiang, Hui'an, and other fellow provincial associations in Shanghai jointly hosted a reception for Chairman Li at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 200 people attended, including Legislative Yuan member Qiu Hanping, Yang Chuo'an, director of the Emergency Procurement and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food, Huan Yuanhuai, president of Great China University, Liang Longguang, director of the Fujian Education Department, and Zheng Kuiyi, a member of various fellow provincial food committees. The atmosphere was warm and enthusiastic. Chen Cheng, a representative of the fellow provincial associations, first delivered a welcome speech, followed by Chairman Li's address.</p>
<p>Exhausting Knowledge and Ability, Striving to the Utmost</p>
<p>Li rose amidst enthusiastic applause to deliver his speech, saying: "I am very moved by the welcome meeting organized by all of you fellow provincials. I think everyone is not only welcoming me personally, but welcoming a Fujianese returning to be the provincial chairman and manage the province's politics. This is a heavy burden related to the happiness of the people of the entire province. I hope that everyone can share this burden and provide guidance and assistance at any time. I think there are two important things in Fujian Province at present: one is to eliminate evil and corruption, which I will do earnestly, and the other is that Fujianese should unite, regardless of whether they are from the east, south, west, or north, and eliminate barriers, and work together to build a new Fujian. Regarding the improvement and renewal of various departments such as people's livelihood, finance, education, construction, military service, public security, and land taxation, I will do my best with my conscience and ability. As for detailed reform measures, they must await my return to Fujian to carefully examine the key issues before I can make decisions quickly."</p>
<p>The Future of Fujian Province Is Very Bright</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan member Qiu Hanping then delivered a speech, saying: "Local autonomy is an important part of democratic politics. We hope for autonomy, and after fifteen years of efforts by our fellow provincials, we have finally obtained the return of Fujianese to govern their own province. This good result is worthy of cherishing. Chairman Li's strict military administration is well-known. His spirit of loyalty to the party, love for the country, and hard work is admirable. His treatment of people can be represented by the four words 'honest, just, and impartial.' Therefore, Mr. Li can be said to be a model soldier and also a model provincial chairman. The future of Fujian Province is very bright. At the same time, we must not be divided by regions, be selfless, and work together to help Chairman Li build our ideal new Fujian." Subsequently, Yang Chuo'an, Ou Yuanhuai, Zeng Jigu, from the Hui'an Fellow Provincial Association, Lin Qingshan, from the Yongchun Fellow Provincial Association, and Ye Baoqi, from the San Shan Guild Hall, delivered speeches one after another, expressing their welcome to Li's appointment and hoping that Li would use new strength and new measures to seek benefits for the people of his hometown. The grand meeting ended at 4:30 PM.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of Shao Guanrong, Shao Liang, and Zhu Bingxi, three detectives from the Detective Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, being accused of bribery will be tried by the District Court on the afternoon of the 24th of this month. A news item was published in a certain newspaper the other day, stating: Feng Qishan, the chief of the Robbery Case Unit of the Detective Section of the Criminal Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, and staff member Feng Xiushan, claimed to Wu Gensheng, the manager of the Saint George's Garden on Donghu Road in this city, that Wu was suspected of privately selling heroin, and that if he could pay 3 billion yuan, the case could be dropped, otherwise he would be arrested and severely punished. Wu, upon hearing this, was extremely worried, and Zhu Bingxi contacted him, paying 1.5 billion yuan in legal tender first. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was discovered by the Police Bureau's Supervision Team. During the second payment of the remaining 1.5 billion yuan, Team Leader Pan of the team dispatched an inspector to arrest Zhu along with officers. After interrogation, the truth was confirmed, and all relevant criminals were arrested overnight. Director Yu of the Police Bureau, in order to rectify discipline and eliminate corruption, immediately detained Feng Qishan, but Feng Xiushan fled in fear of punishment and has not yet been brought to justice. It is now heard that Feng Qishan has been temporarily released on bail by Sun Kuifang, the head of the Criminal Division, and Li Junhou, the head of the Detective Section, with the condition that he must track down and arrest Feng Xiushan within three days. It is also said that the police officers involved in the case, Shao Guanrong, Shao Liang, and Zhu Bingxi, were handed over to the District Court for trial on charges of corruption by the Municipal Police Bureau on the 14th of this month. After seeing the report, the Municipal Police Bureau sent a letter to a certain newspaper that published the news on the 19th, correcting that Feng Qishan was not involved in the case and is still working in the bureau as usual. This correction letter led Wu Gensheng, the manager of Saint George's Garden, who was the victim, to publish large advertisements in various newspapers for several days, refuting the Police Bureau's correction letter as inconsistent with the facts, calling on all sectors to uphold justice, and detailing the facts. As of now, the mastermind behind this extortion and corruption case remains confusing and intriguing, but after the District Court opens the trial on the 24th, its relationship can be determined.</p>

<p>Xu Jiying Shows Opinion, First Eliminate Bad Habits</p>
<p>Xu Jiying, Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the Municipal Council, spoke to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday in response to President Jiang's movement to build the country through diligence and thrift, saying: "Diligence and thrift are virtues that have been passed down in our country for thousands of years. The meaning of these two words is already known to everyone. The sayings 'Diligence can make up for clumsiness, and thrift can cultivate integrity' are especially good words. In President Jiang's broadcast, he elaborated on them in detail. If the ten covenants he instructed can be effectively implemented by everyone from top to bottom, the magnificent effect is self-evident. However, I personally feel that although the people of our country are familiar with this movement, its relationship with the country, society, and even individuals is deep and important, but bad habits are too deep. People only know how to talk about it but cannot take action, so that even today, the national leader must advocate and the social masses must promote it. To advocate and promote effectively, we must first eliminate bad habits and make people aware of the importance of this movement to the current environment."</p>
<p>Active Production, Passive Conservation</p>
<p>"The war of resistance against Japan has ended, but the internal turmoil launched by the Communist army is still intensifying. Various undertakings waiting for construction are therefore hindered, and the national economy has not improved. If we remain the same and do not improve, the future crisis is unimaginable. Therefore, today, it is urgent to build the country through diligence and thrift. Especially since the government is determined to rectify the economy and issued an emergency decree, it can be said that it has eliminated a vicious cycle and opened up a new path for us to work hard to renew ourselves. The people of the country should catch up quickly and reverse the declining trend, so that the government's efforts will be supported and the country's future will be guaranteed. As for how to combine the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift with actual life, President Jiang's ten covenants have very comprehensive and practical indicators. As far as our industrial and commercial circles are concerned, diligence means actively working hard to produce, and thrift means passively saving consumption. As long as we do everything practically and persevere without slackening, I believe that our country will definitely become rich and strong because of this, and we ourselves will also receive supreme benefits."</p>
<p>Wu Yun Comments</p>
<p>Wu Yun, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, expressed extreme support for the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift and expressed his views yesterday, saying: "The poverty of officials and the treachery of merchants, all kinds of evils, are caused by the omnipotence of money. With money, one can achieve what one wants. Everyone is greedy, and everyone loves money, so they do not hesitate to use deceitful and stealing means to obtain money. Therefore, to reverse the declining national customs and establish national morality, we must reduce the use of money, that is, we must eliminate the bad habit of luxury. The movement to build the country through diligence and thrift is indeed a specific and correct medicine for the times."</p>
<p>Promote Good People, Expose Bad People, Jing Panshi Expresses Views</p>
<p>Dr. Jing Panshi, Chairman of the Far East Council of the World Christian Leadership Association, recently expressed his views on the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift, saying: "The movement to build the country through diligence and thrift is aimed at all those who are not diligent or thrifty. Those who are arrogant, extravagant, dissolute, and do not move or pick up may only account for a small number in society, but the foundation of the country and nation is being eroded and rotted by a small number of people. The majority of diligent people cannot be ignored. I believe that to make the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift effective, we should first do two things: 'Promote good people' and 'Expose bad people.' Those who are diligent and thrifty should be rewarded with honors, and those who are extravagant and lazy should not only be condemned morally but also punished legally."</p>

<h3 id="e107">Underground Springs Drawn from Sandy Wastes <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Song Binglin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] Gansu is high in altitude and dry in climate, with frequent droughts. Especially in the Hexi region, agriculture relies entirely on the snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains for irrigation. Speaking of water conservancy in Hexi, good systems existed as far back as the Han Dynasty. Later, the center of politics, economy, and culture gradually shifted eastward. Due to its strategically important location, Hexi became a battleground for military strategists, leading to natural disasters and man-made calamities. The people suffered greatly, and water conservancy naturally declined.</p>
<p>Developing Water Conservancy in Hexi</p>
<p>Since the success of the Northern Expedition in the Republic of China, the central government has paid considerable attention to water conservancy in Gansu Province. During the war (year 31 of the Republic), the President inspected the Northwest and showed particular concern for the development of water conservancy in Hexi. He ordered former Chairman Gu Zhenglun to draft a "Ten-Year Implementation Plan for Gansu to Develop Water Conservancy in Hexi," entrusting the Gansu Water Conservancy and Forestry Company to manage it. Furthermore, the "Resolution to Expedite the Completion of Permanent Benefits in Hexi" was passed at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee in the 33rd year of the Republic, leading to the birth of the "Twelve-Year Plan for Gansu's Hexi Water Conservancy." Last year, the Gansu Water Conservancy Bureau was established, and a new water conservancy work plan was drawn up. Despite changes in personnel and plans over the past seven years, the goal has remained consistent: "To expand the irrigated area, increase food production, maintain the existing population, and attract immigrants from elsewhere." Currently, besides the Gansu Water Conservancy Bureau, the central government has the Hexi Water Conservancy Engineering Corps (with six detachments) and the Gansu Hydrological General Station, among other units, engaged in water conservancy work in Hexi.</p>
<p>Developing water conservancy in Hexi involves repairing old canals, opening new ones, and building reservoirs to retain water. However, there is a prerequisite: after the water flows out of the Qilian Mountain pass, it seeps into the desert within a hundred li. This terrain, covering 20 million mu, has abundant underground water reserves, rendering the costly canals and reservoirs ineffective. Therefore, after inspecting Hexi last year, the current Director of the Gansu Water Conservancy Bureau, Huang Wanli, decided on six strategies for Hexi's water conservancy. The most important of these was how to draw the underground water to the surface for irrigation.</p>
<p>Underground Aqueduct Method</p>
<p>This method is not yet widespread. There are only a dozen or so documented underground water projects worldwide. The entire water supply of Mönchengladbach in Germany relies on underground water using this method. There are no precedents in the Americas, and in the Far East, only one place in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation used this method. This method requires two conditions: a high underground water table and steep terrain. According to Huang Wanli, the Hexi region of Gansu is the only vast area in the world with the most suitable topography for this method.</p>
<p>Based on this belief, Director Huang believed that in order for the people to understand this "way to create resources," a model must first be created. Therefore, last year, Shandan and Jiuquan were selected to conduct experiments using two different methods. Huang traveled extensively, exhausting himself, and finally obtained two excavators from the Relief Administration. He trained fifty engineers (ten of whom were students from the China Vocational School) and requested funding from the central government and the US Aid Council. Notably, this was the first time the US Aid Council had allocated funds to the Northwest.</p>
<p>Construction Began in June</p>
<p>With all preparations in place, construction began successively in May and June of this year. Work was suspended for a month and a half around August due to the busy farming season, and has recently resumed. Work in Shandan lasted for two months. According to the government report, a total of 23.1 billion legal currency was spent, providing relief to many disaster victims in Yongchang and Minle. The original plan was to dig a water interception ditch four zhang deep to irrigate 20,000 mu of land. However, hard soil layers were encountered at a depth of more than one zhang, so the original plan was reduced by half, and the project cost was also reduced from the equivalent of 24,000 shi of wheat to 2,500 shi. Comparing the project cost and efficiency, the economic value has indeed increased. The project is now 60% complete, and water will be supplied to the fields in October. The government is planning to establish cooperative farms to distribute land to poor farmers for cultivation. Next spring, clear streams will flow through the sandy wastes. The project in Bianwan, Jiuquan, is 20% complete, and water has also been extracted. The original plan was to irrigate 60,000 mu of land. According to government announcements, 42 billion legal currency has been spent. Whether water can be used next spring will depend on funding and manpower, requiring redoubled efforts.</p>
<p>Spring Water Flows Gurgling</p>
<p>When water gurgles out of the ground in the vast sandy wastes, the local farmers stare with astonished eyes, wondering if they are dreaming (indeed, when this reporter first saw this scene, I was so excited that I almost shed tears). They say that the water conservancy engineering team must have a magic mirror that can see through the ground, otherwise, how would they know where there is water, and it would come out as soon as they dug? Director Huang said to the reporter with a smile: "This is based on academic theories including soil science, geology, and hydraulic engineering. Now the people of neighboring counties are requesting the development of underground water one after another. It has been decided to develop five places including Bulongji. We hope that after the demonstration projects in Shandan and Jiuquan serve as examples, the farmers will handle it themselves with our only technical guidance. This way, we can expand and popularize this new enterprise."</p>
<p>The advantage of this method is not only that it is simple and cheap (the project cost for irrigating each mu of land is only one shi of wheat, and each mu of land can produce more than two shi of wheat per year), but also that the money is mostly used for manual digging, which farmers can do themselves, and the project can be expanded or reduced depending on manpower and financial resources (Shandan is a good example), making it easy to see results.</p>
<p>Director Huang Wanli's Remarks</p>
<p>"The difficulty," Director Huang said, "is that the advanced technical theory cannot be mastered by ordinary engineers."</p>
<p>Huang continued: "To start a new enterprise, in addition to scientific theoretical basis, you also need a detailed plan, and then promote it with great courage and perseverance to succeed."</p>
<p>"This only piece of land in the world suitable for this type of underground water project, the land and people of Hexi can be proud! Revealing this path and using the results of this project experiment to elucidate new underground water theory, to contribute to the whole world, this is also something that the land and people of China can be proud of!..."</p>
<p>Director Huang Wanli is the eldest son of Mr. Huang Yanpei. He specialized in hydraulic engineering in the United States, so many of his subordinates are students from the China Vocational School who came to the Northwest to serve. Huang has a dignified appearance, resembling a banker. He believes that the Water Conservancy Bureau should not only be an administrative agency, but also a business organization. At the Gansu Provincial Assembly on July 22 this year, after he reported on the water conservancy administration, he said: "The purpose of water conservancy is to exchange a small amount of money for a large amount of production. The most important step in water conservancy is design, like the staff work of warfare. If the design is perfect, it can be successful." Therefore, people gave him a nickname: "Design Expert" (he also received the nickname "Model Expert" when he held the Lanzhou-Fengxiang Canal model exhibition last year.)</p>

<h3 id="e108">Outpost in Central China, River Defense Base: Shashi <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shashi Sixteenth Dispatch] In mid-August, the Communists seized a gap and attacked the outskirts of Jingzhou and Shashi. In Shashi, which was not heavily garrisoned, it is conceivable that people felt uneasy. Fortunately, the Communist surprise attack was only like a breeze, lightly blowing over and lightly blowing away. The phoenix trees brought autumn wind to Shashi, and the external threat was temporarily resolved. However, the inner worries of the people of Shashi deepened with the arrival of the autumn wind.</p>
<p>In Shashi, there are only two or three shabby hotels, and not a single bathhouse. Not a single magnificent restaurant can be found on the most prosperous Zhongshan Road. For an inland commercial center like Shashi, the fact that there are so few places for consumption shows that the Shashi market is entirely built on the rural economy.</p>
<p>The hinterland of Shashi includes the entire central Hubei plain. Rice from Jiangbei and cotton from Jiangnan are the two lifelines of Shashi. Since Dabie Mountain became a Communist base in central Hubei and Li Renlin's troops infiltrated the area between the Yangtze and Han rivers, central Hubei in Jiangbei has long been filled with the smoke of war. This year, during the annual flood season, under the round-the-clock supervision of Commissioner Zhang Zhenguo, the Jingjiang Dam was fortunately spared any major trouble. Instead, the continuous rain from March to June damaged the autumn harvest. In Jiangling County alone, over 1.7 million mu of the 2.4 million mu of land were flooded. Generally speaking, the autumn harvest in central Hubei this year is likely to be only 60% of normal. In Shashi these days, the supply of rice cannot be strong due to transportation and production issues, and merchants from Yichang, Hankou, and Hunan continue to come to Shashi to purchase, so rice prices are rising daily. Therefore, don't be envious of the 15 yuan per dan of white rice, because the sensitive Shashi Chamber of Commerce had already discussed restricting rice exports a month ago; and the Shashi grain industry has also begun to worry about a potential grain shortage in Shashi!</p>
<p>Jiangnan is still a clean slate at the moment, but years of war and layers of exploitation and burden have devastated the already weak rural economy. Some people, for the sake of survival, have had to take risks and engage in robbery. "Ambush and concealment are rife, causing much concern." Officials are also worried about this fact. The few roads in Jiangnan that can be considered main lines are usually not heavily traveled, especially by merchants. Therefore, although this year's cotton production has not suffered from natural disasters, the joint assessment report from the National Textile Federation and the Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry estimates that "due to security concerns in Hubei, this year's production will sharply decline from 6,241,100 dan last year to 1,866,600 dan" (original text not recorded). Therefore, the production and sales situation when cotton enters the market at the end of the eighth lunar month is not something to be too optimistic about. During the week that the reporter stayed in Shashi, the market price of Shashi long-staple cotton jumped from over 60 yuan to 96.2 yuan. 96.2 yuan is still the price announced in the local newspaper, but in reality, it is likely to be higher. This fact is enough to make people think about how much business the cotton from southern Hubei can add to Shashi this year—although it is still a time of "shortage before the new crop." According to general estimates:</p>
<p>Of the rice produced in the plains of central Hubei, 40% is left for local consumption, and the remaining 60% is entirely exported to Shanghai and Hankou through Shashi. Cotton is almost entirely exported, with very limited local consumption. Before the war, during the "peak month" of the year—the eighth lunar month—rice and cotton bales piled up like mountains on the docks along the river. The big ships of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Dabei Steamship Company sometimes couldn't cope with their customers who shipped goods eastward, and almost every ship had to "cancel" several batches of goods. This year, the rice harvest is poor, making it difficult to ship excess rice, and the fate of cotton production is still unpredictable, so the docks naturally seem deserted. As the cool breeze rises and the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, according to the custom of ten years ago, the entrances of silver shops and fabric stores in Shashi should be decorated with lanterns and high arches to attract their "basic customers" from the countryside. But looking at the expressionless Zhongshan Road this year, the people of Shashi are inevitably filled with melancholy.</p>
<p>The business circle in Shashi today is too small. The Hanyi Highway was dissected, and the left and right arms of Shashi were cut off invisibly. The Yangtze River was originally the main artery of Shashi, but due to excessive military requisitioning, the grand scene of the government returning to Chongqing three years ago is repeated on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Ships of 3,000 to 4,000 tons above Hankou are as rare as the Queen Elizabeth. Passengers taking ships in Shashi, whether going upriver or downriver, usually have to wait for half a month. A berth on the ship, not even a room, costs over 150 million legal currency on the black market two weeks in advance. The main line to Xiangyang is maintained under the cloud of war on both sides. Although the purpose of keeping the road open is to focus on military transport, some supplies from northern Hubei can still use Shashi as a transit station to dilute the desolation of Shashi, as the Xianghan Highway (Xiangyang-Hankou) is not open. These days, on the highway in the northwest corner of Shashi, one can often see trucks loaded with cotton, transported from Xiangyang to Shashi. (This is still cotton from past stocks.) In fact, the poor transportation can only match the current inadequate Shashi market. If we could bring back the days of ten years ago, without any other factors, this pitiful transportation alone would be enough to suffocate Shashi!</p>
<p>Transportation problems are suffocating the Shashi market, and Shashi itself has even more</p>
<p>Intricate diseases hindering market development</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Shashi could be said to be the enemy's front line in Central China (although Yichang was ahead). Therefore, the damage to Shashi from the war was not light. Countless tall buildings in Shashi were destroyed by bombs. Zhongshan Road, west of Chongwen Road, was completely reduced to ashes. To this day, there are only some thatched huts or dilapidated tile houses, shrinking their heads and standing by the roadside. Some of the larger buildings that survived still have machine gun bullet holes in their iron gates. This situation has created a congenital factor of housing shortage. However, the endless war in the area between the Yangtze and Han rivers has caused people from rural areas to concentrate in the city. Although in the midst of the uproar, there are not few people in Shashi who have fled to Hankou or Shanghai, but these people are too few to offset the refugees from the vast rural areas. Under the interlacing of congenital and acquired factors, Shashi began a housing shortage. According to the "market price" a month ago, the annual rent for an ordinary shop is 3 billion legal currency, equivalent to 100 shi of rice. Moreover, since the housing shortage began, landlords have become more shrewd, stipulating that rent must be paid in advance. 100 shi of rice may not be a difficult word to bear in a city, but in an inland city like Shashi, merchants need to consider this burden. In fact, how many people today in Shashi can find a shop to do business with more than 500 shi of rice worth of capital? After paying the rent and decoration fees, most of the capital is gone. Is this the way to do business? They know it's difficult and retreat, only to run single, trading smuggled goods to South China.</p>
<p>Shashi is a producing market, and consumption can never catch up with production.</p>
<p>The Shanghai exchange rate and the Hankou exchange rate also indirectly affect the market. The Shanghai exchange rate can reach 70% or even 60% at its highest, and the cheap smuggled goods from South China cause inland consumers to shift their goals to Guangzhou, which is strongly supported by the abnormal Shanghai-Hankou exchange rate. Here, Shanghai goods are sometimes cheaper than in Shanghai, which is a byproduct of the abnormal exchange rate. This abnormal state benefits a small number of consumers in the interior; and it hurts a large number of farmers who produce. If the inland exchange rate continues to develop in this state, the result will inevitably affect the outlet of agricultural products; and it will stimulate prices in the sales area.</p>
<p>The depression of Shashi may not be eliminated in the short term. Under the current overall situation, Shashi is the outpost of the Central China battlefield and the base of river defense. The depression of Shashi has its inherent factors. Therefore, everyone in Shashi places their hopes for eliminating these troubles on the success of the suppression of the rebellion and economic stability.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The School for War Orphans has been established for a year. On September 18, a memorial meeting was held at the school in Suzhou, presided over by Bishop Yu Bin. Dozens of directors from Nanjing and Shanghai, including Wang Boyuan, Lu Yinggeng, Wang Xiaolai, and Cai Renbao, attended. The school currently has 188 students, divided into two departments: agronomy and cotton weaving. Food, lodging, books, and supplies are provided by the school. However, applicants must present a pension certificate or documents from their original unit or local government. After verification, only those who are confirmed to be war orphans are eligible for preferential treatment. Last year, the school also reclaimed 7,862 mu of wasteland in Taihu Lake, Wujiang County, as a farm site, and recruited 3,200 refugees from northern Jiangsu and poor farmers from nearby areas to build embankments and begin cultivation. In the future, the harvest will be divided equally between the cultivators and the school to provide for the education and upbringing expenses of the orphans. It is expected that in two or three years, the school will be able to become self-sufficient.</p>

<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Sang Jun</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kaifeng Fifteenth Dispatch] As soon as one enters Henan Province on the Longhai Railway, every foreign traveler has a novel feeling. The people of Henan are so respectful and yet so persistent towards the Yellow River! It is said that once Kaifeng held a civil service examination. In the answer to the question of flood prevention, one person wrote: First, more cattle and sheep should be raised, hoping that they will drink all the water in a few years. Second, it is hoped that Qin Shihuang will be resurrected and drive the mountains of Shanxi and Shaanxi to make dikes. This may be a joke, but the persistence of the people of Henan in the spirit of water management is admirable. As the autumn floods approach, the turbid waves of the Yellow River roar by the banks all day long, and the residents outside the dikes still operate so peacefully. Before the closure of the Huayuankou breach, Director Zhu Guangcai of the Engineering Bureau cried bitterly in anxiety, but one day, the river workers found a water snake by the dike, saying that the Fourth Dragon King of Jinlong had appeared, and the closure would be successful. Then everyone worked together with one heart, and everyone bravely rushed to close the breach, and it was completed immediately. This kind of persistent and simple force is so lovely!</p>
<p>The people of Henan are actually not only like this towards things, but even more so towards people. Liu Jingfu served as governor of Henan for many years. Because public sentiment was very agreeable, Mrs. Liu liked to cook Yellow River carp with cellophane noodles and chili peppers. The people of Henan learned it immediately and called it Mrs. Fish. In any restaurant in Henan, if you order "Mrs. Fish," the waiter will respectfully bring it up. After the defeat of the Communist army in the Central Plains War, wounded soldiers were transported to northern Henan. There was no medicine along the way, so the people were asked to wash their wounds with salt water. Many wounded Communists died along the way. This impression cannot be erased for the people of Henan. Chatting with a few farmers, they will tell you too many stories: "The way the Eighth Route Army treated human life was really immoral!" In the Yellow Flood Area, they pointed to the white bones left behind in those "human wave tactics," "The Eighth Route Army soldiers were also raised by their parents!" Without guidance and propaganda, the consciousness of humanitarianism made them affirm the decline of the Communist army.</p>
<p>The people of Henan still tell stories about the Communist army's</p>
<p>deflated state during battles. Distant artillery fire is always inaccurate. When attacking the Songmen gate in Kaifeng, many howitzers had to use machine gun cover, pushed directly to within one or two hundred meters of the city wall before daring to pull the string. Later, when Kaifeng fell, the Communist army used all their housekeeping skills. On the street, the broadcast of the Communist headquarters was being rebroadcast, earnestly declaring that they would never disturb the people. At the same time, nearly a thousand Communists changed into civilian clothes and broke into the largest Tianfeng Flour Mill in Kaifeng. 2,800 bags of wheat, 70,000 sacks, more than 3,000 shi of flour, dozens of machines, and even the bedding and luggage, doors and windows, and benches of the employees were all looted in one fell swoop. Later, a column commander named Chen expressed his condolences to Chen Xuchu, the manager of Tianfeng, and said: Does your factory need relief? Chen Xuchu replied angrily: It would have been better if you hadn't robbed us. I don't think you can make up for my five trillion loss! In the end, Chen requested that he be arrested. The column commander was puzzled, and Chen said: Because I want to see Mao Zedong and ask him how to explain that set of "fighting for the liberation of the people"?</p>
<p>The people of Henan are now emotionally lonely. The excessively heavy burden of military grain, the sub-standard impoverished life, and the fact that the people in the rear rarely understand it, that's fine. What is most embarrassing for the people of Henan is that the rich households in this province are also moving to the rear. How mysterious is the rear? Isn't the forefront the most stable? They believe that only the forefront is the most reliable, prices are stable, and the military and civilians are integrated. They also believe that the military situation will soon be developed. They hope that</p>
<p>After the military situation develops, politics can be effectively taken over. They also forgive the difficulties of the local administrative authorities. It is quite difficult to compete with the Communists in a "poor" environment. But this era is an era where everything must be competed for! Politics needs competition, and military affairs need competition. They said: We are also competing with the people in the Communist areas! If we don't eat millet, we eat black sorghum. If we don't wear clothes, we go naked. We hand everything over to the government, and the Communists will collapse sooner or later! For this group of compatriots living in strong and persistent emotions, it is our responsibility not to let them feel lonely in spirit!</p>

<p>Approximately 200 Pieces of Works from Various Dynasties Are Extremely Valuable</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Preparatory Office of the Municipal Art Museum of this city, in order to promote sculpture art, has specially collected a large number of ancient sculpture treasures from famous domestic collectors. From the 20th to the 26th of this month, they will be displayed at the French Association on Nanchang Road for one week for public viewing and research. The sculptures on display include stone carvings, wood carvings, bronzes, and pottery from the Three Dynasties, Qin, Han, Wei, Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, totaling about 200 pieces, all of which are extremely valuable. The stone carving rubbings include pieces unearthed from Tianlong Mountain, Xiaoshan Hall, Wu Liang Shrine, Yungang, Longmen, Dunhuang, Dazu, Xi'an, Luoyang, and Shaci District. The bronzes include Shang and Zhou dynasty ritual vessels and Qin Dynasty gilt bronze Buddhas. The pottery includes Sui Dynasty ox carts and Tang Dynasty tri-color camels and horses. In addition to the wood carvings of the Chu people from the Warring States period, the Han Dynasty carved wooden horses and the Buddha head from the Xiangguo Temple in Kaifeng best represent the essence and achievements of ancient Chinese sculpture art. (Attached picture: Tang Dynasty Wooden Carving of Guanyin)</p>
<p>[Another report] The Chinese Sculpture Exhibition opened yesterday. This exhibition is the first of its kind in Shanghai, and the audience was very enthusiastic. The ox cart of Zheng Zhenduo, the Sui Dynasty warrior statue of Guo Molin, the large camel and horse of Ding Huikang, the bronzes of the Three Dynasties, and the Chu bronze mirrors of Jiang Xuanyi were the most admired by the audience. Other items, such as the Longmen statues of Xu Weinan and the newly discovered Han and Song Dynasty stone carving rubbings from Sichuan by Chen Yishi, are rarely seen elsewhere.</p>

Currently, there are five colleges: Literature, Science, Engineering, Law, and Commerce, with 18 departments and more than 1,600 students and 300 faculty and staff. The university's recurrent expenses for the first half of the year, such as only 600 million yuan in June, will be 21 billion yuan per month in the second half of the year. The special expenses (construction and expansion improvement expenses) were allocated 2 billion yuan in the first half of the year and will increase to 93 billion yuan in the second half of the year (equivalent to more than 31,000 gold yuan).</p>
<p>Open Tennis Finals Today</p>
<p>Tao and Ye Compete for the Championship</p>
<p>Three Matches in Men's and Women's Singles Total</p>
<p>Held at the Youth Tennis Club</p>
<p>The singles finals of the public tennis competition, including Guanqiu and Baoyi, are scheduled to start at 2 PM today at the Youth Tennis Club at 676 Xishan Road (formerly 454 Xishan Road). The tennis community has been anticipating this final for a long time. Unfortunately, last week's heavy rain prevented it, so the singles and doubles finals were rescheduled for today and tomorrow. Tennis fans have sent letters to the Youth Tennis Club requesting that the finals still be held on weekends to facilitate participation by office workers, but the Tennis Committee, due to repeated obstacles and delays in this open competition, is eager to finish it, unless there is a change in the weather, it will not be rescheduled.</p>
<p>Today's first match, the intermediate singles between Wei Shisun and Ma Jingrong, will start at 2:30 PM. It is hoped that Wei and Ma will arrive on time to avoid affecting the following matches. The second match is the women's singles between Yang Weibin and Zhu Zhiying. Judging by their skills, Yang has a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>The last match is the final between Ye and Tao. Whether Ye can continue to maintain the national championship honor and whether Tao can avenge his defeat in the National Games depends on the outcome of this battle.</p>
<p>Tickets are divided into one yuan, two yuan, and reserved seats for five yuan and three yuan. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Wei Shisun - Ma Jingrong 2:30 PM Referee Lin Baohua</p>

<p>Small Victory Over the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration have a tradition of holding an annual tennis competition, which is held alternately at the courts of the Ministry of Communications and the Railway Bureau. Yesterday was the third anniversary of the recovery of the two railway bureaus, and to celebrate, the third tennis competition was changed to be held on that day. The Ministry of Communications was led by Director Li Zubing of the General Affairs Department, along with the three musketeers of the Ministry of Communications' tennis team, Zhuang Liangrui, Shi Shiyuan, Zhang Jizeng, and Zheng Haoru, totaling 12 people. The Railway Bureau was led by Wang Zhaohuai and Mei Fuqiang, chairman and vice chairman of the Workers' Sports Association, along with players such as Guo Qida, Zhan Wanyao, and Zhong Shibao. There were 6 doubles groups and 11 singles groups. In each group, the results of the two-set matches showed that both sides had athletes from the National Games, and their strengths were evenly matched. The singles matches were won by each side in 11 sets, and the Railway Bureau won the doubles match by 7 to 5. The overall result was 18 to 16, with the Railway Bureau winning slightly over the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Third Small Ball League Group A</p>

<p>The Group A of the Third Small Ball League opened last Friday. It was originally scheduled to continue the weekend matches on Saturday, but unfortunately, the autumn rain fell suddenly, and all matches were postponed. According to the announcement by the organizers yesterday, the above schedule has been moved to this weekend (25-26) and will still be contested at Jin Yuan Park. However, the Yanghang Lan team of Group A2 requested to be changed to Group B, which was approved. Huaguang Lan was promoted to fill the vacancy. Therefore, Yanghang Lan will compete with Huaguang on Sunday. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Saturday (25th)</p>

<p>National Arts Performance Concludes Successfully</p>
<p>The Northeast Branch of the Central National Arts Hall held a National Arts Performance Competition in Shanghai, which concluded successfully yesterday. There were more than 2,000 spectators, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. Under the leadership of Chairman Yu Bin and Director Li Daheng, the hall promoted the national quintessence, and the grand performance was an unprecedented event in Shanghai for decades.</p>
<p>Third Table Tennis League</p>
<p>Group B Fierce Battle Today</p>
<p>In the Third Table Tennis League, there will be seven matches today (21st), held in six different rooms. In Group B, Chunmao will play against Lianshi Jia in two matches. Lian Richang, the star player of the former team, has recovered from his hand injury and will decide to participate in the match tonight, greatly increasing his strength. The latter team has been demoralized since its captain Chen Pengyao has been absent several times, and has repeatedly requested a rescheduling. From now on, they must play according to the schedule. In addition, Muhuocai will play against the Jews at the Jewish Hall on Tangshan Road. The Jews have had one point deducted because the new star Jia Zhi was disqualified, which is a great advantage. If Muhuocai loses this match, it will give the Jews even more hope of winning the championship, which is a major concern for all the Chinese teams in Group B.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Hualianhua Lai of Group A had sufficient stamina and defeated Qinglian 5 to 4. The results of both sides and today's schedule are recorded below:</p>

<p>Wins All-American Singles Championship</p>
<p>Mrs. DuPont Wins Women's Title</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Linshan, 19th] Gongchaiers, a 20-year-old youth from Los Angeles, defeated South Africa's Stettjes 6-2, 6-3, 14-12 in straight sets on the 19th to win this year's All-American Amateur Tennis Singles Championship. Gongchaiers, who was only ranked as the eighth seed, achieved the most amazing success in tennis history with this victory, earning warm cheers from more than 10,000 spectators at the stadium. Before winning the right to the finals, Gongchaiers bravely defeated strong opponents Parker and Trollobni, reaching the final week. South Africa's Stettjes, although defeated, was still glorious, having defeated American Davis Cup players Tapertoff and Frehm. Stettjes, who used to be an aircraft pilot, is 28 years old this year and came to the United States at his own expense to compete. Gongchaiers defeated Stettjes with his serve and all-around offense. When the score was tied in the third game, it was near dusk and it was bound to be extended to the 20th. However, Gong made persistent efforts, finished the third game in one go. Before the game, in the women's final, Mrs. DuPont came from behind and defeated last year's champion Ms. Bai Lu 4-6, 6-4, 15-13. Mrs. DuPont's father died in a car accident three days ago. However, Mrs. DuPont won the women's championship in mourning.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>The Inside Story of Marshal Eisenhower's Refusal to Run for President Liu Tai</p>
<p>Marshal Eisenhower's achievements in this great war are outstanding and have become the only figure in the United States who can be supported by the whole country. Many people believe that he has the greatest hope in this year's American election. However, he resolutely refused to run and settled down as the president of Columbia University.</p>
<p>Why did he resolutely refuse to run, even at the cost of disappointing countless people in the country?</p>
<p>Here is an answer. The original author of this article is Eisenhower's friend, Marquis W. Childs, who is now lecturing at Columbia University. He is a famous writer and has a deep relationship with Eisenhower.</p>
<p>As early as a year ago, when Eisenhower was still the Chief of Staff, many friends often visited him. After the greetings, they talked about politics, and everyone indirectly asked him about his opinions on the election. Eisenhower was not very happy and said, "My old friends are all like this, which is really unexpected. I tell them that I have no intention of running for election, but they always don't believe it. Just look at their smiles..."</p>
<p>But the politicians in Washington still wore that kind of half-believing smile, and they still didn't believe that he really had no intention of running for election.</p>
<p>Last December, Eisenhower and his wife attended a grand banquet. Vandenberg and Taft were also present. Everyone happily raised their glasses and chatted. Eisenhower inadvertently talked about the gains and losses of domestic politics. As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone else stopped talking and listened to him quietly. He said that most of the labor-management disputes were caused by both sides being selfish and disregarding the overall situation. He admitted that inflation had reached a terrible level. He hoped that the capitalists could take the lead in reducing profits and saving the crisis.</p>
<p>Okay, all the politicians present unanimously believed that he was going to run for election - in their view, these words were clearly the tone of a candidate announcing the outline of his policies!</p>
<p>A few days later, a current affairs commentary was suddenly broadcast on a radio station. The radio commentator said: "General Eisenhower, who may participate in the general election, has expressed his opinion on curbing inflation. He suggested that the government convene the heads of the national business community and put pressure on them to force them to stabilize prices within two or three years, and any profits will not be allowed... General Eisenhower said that if the business community refuses to cooperate, Congress should pass a bill to levy a 100% profit tax, and the tax revenue will be used to subsidize various companies, and the government will force price suppression."</p>
<p>This was of course a distortion of the facts, with the purpose of deliberately embarrassing Eisenhower. The two reporters present immediately denied it on his behalf, but Eisenhower himself did not express any opinion. Unexpectedly, a distinguished guest suddenly arrived at the Army Department and said, "This kind of distortion is really outrageous. I am willing to provide written proof that you did not say such a thing."</p>
<p>This distinguished guest was Vandenberg, who held a pivotal position in the Congress.</p>
<p>However, Eisenhower advised him not to do so, and advocated letting it take its course. From then on, Eisenhower's friendship with Vandenberg deepened, and Eisenhower also understood that some people in the Republican Party were trying their best to attack him.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, the movement to support Eisenhower became even more enthusiastic. A Republican with a very high status came to urge him to run, but Eisenhower said, "I know your party doesn't want me."</p>
<p>Finally, Eisenhower wrote a letter with even firmer wording to those who supported him, clearly stating that he would not run. He said that the United States has no shortage of talented people who can be worthy of this position. He came from the military and cannot take this important position, and the United States does not need a military man as president.</p>
<p>At that time, he accepted the position of president of Columbia University, but rumors immediately arose, saying that the president of the university was just a bridge between the General Staff Headquarters and the Presidential Palace. Eisenhower ignored it.</p>
<p>The drama on the Republican side had just ended, and the Democrats came again.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that President Truman's reputation has declined. The Democratic Party is eager to find a person who is supported by the public to replace him - Eisenhower is naturally the most suitable person. Therefore, as soon as he sat down in the president's office of Columbia University, distinguished guests from the Democratic Party came one after another. At least eight senators and six governors had come to persuade him to run, but Eisenhower's answer was still a "no".</p>
<p>In fact, there are indeed many people in the Democratic Party who support Eisenhower. Southern party members support Eisenhower because they oppose Truman's civil rights bill, but left-wing party members, New Deal factions, labor union leaders, etc. have also expressed enthusiastic support. Only James Farley, a veteran of the Democratic Party, said that if Truman refuses to step down voluntarily, Eisenhower will not come out. Later, Eisenhower told others that he agreed with Farley's statement.</p>
<p>On June 6, the results of the public opinion survey were: Eisenhower was the most popular person in both the Democratic and Republican parties. Eisenhower naturally saw it very clearly. When the Republican Party and the Dewey faction united to ask Eisenhower to run again, he couldn't help but smile. He said, "They want to use me to win - I am not happy to be a wedding dress for others like this." He issued two written statements in a row, with decisive and irreversible wording, and the situation was clarified.</p>
<p>Eisenhower's intentions are very deep. On the one hand, he felt that his prestige could play a greater role when he was outside the political circle. On the other hand, it is very difficult for a soldier to be president. If he reorganizes the military and strengthens it, others will criticize him for being biased towards the military. If he deliberately relaxes in military affairs, the current relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is already so tense, how can he delay the overall situation? Eisenhower's resolute refusal to run for election is a fundamental reason.</p>
<p>Biography Sobei</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Library of Congress in the United States: There are five people in the world with the most biographies written about them, including:</p>
<p>There are 5,152 books written about Jesus Christ; 3,172 books about Shakespeare; 2,319 books about Lincoln; 1,755 books about Washington; and 1,735 books about Napoleon I.</p>
<p>On Remembering Ye Juchang Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>The "Record of Book Collection Affairs Poems" written by Ye Juchang (Changchi) of Wumen is a major anecdote for book collectors. Scholars of plate versions in the world cannot seek it outside of this. Last year, I purchased his old collection of "Looking Up at the Thousand Seven Hundred and Twenty-Nine Crane Studio Series" at a bookstore in Suzhou, with two collection seals "Changchi" and "Yuan Du", and two long postscripts. One was signed "Early Autumn of Wuzi" and the other was signed "May 29th of Guangxu Bingxu", calling himself Jiren, which was only twenty days after his mother's death. Examining Juchang's "Yuan Du Studio Diary Notes", Juchang was 38 years old in Bingxu and 40 years old in Wuzi. "Looking Up at the Thousand Seven Hundred and Twenty-Nine Crane Studio Series" was published by Zhao Huishu. Juchang's handwritten postscript stated: "Huishu's collection of secret books in four boxes are all unseen in the world, and he planned to publish them one by one, but he only completed four volumes and passed away suddenly; his son continued to engrave the fifth volume, and its contents were still determined by Huishu's handwriting..." and so on. This book of Juchang was given to him by his friend, a certain observer. In the autumn of Guangxu Yiyou, Juchang planned to go to the capital, passed through Shanghai, and stayed in Jixianli. He received a letter from his uncle, informing him that his mother was seriously ill. He returned to Wumen in a hurry, and the trip to the north did not materialize. The following year, his mother passed away. Volume 3 of "Yuan Du Studio Diary Notes" Yiyou, records this event with few details, and the dates are also slightly different, for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Although Juchang was proficient in the study of plate versions, his family had few fine books. He once said: "I grew up in the countryside and lived off Dongling, and I was accustomed to hearing about making a living. Although I love books, I cannot stop discussing prices, and I missed the opportunity to acquire fine manuscripts and secret scrolls. Every time I think about it, it is like a pearl without an elephant net, which cannot be obtained again. In the eighth consciousness field, I left a bag of grain seeds, which has been eradicated for thirty years but has not been completely eliminated. Alas, what can I do!" Juchang was proficient in appraisal, no less than Yaopu Jianbin. But he was troubled by financial constraints and could not accumulate everything for himself, so he sat and watched good people bundle and carry them away. Hundreds of Song and thousands of Yuan books were only like passing clouds.</p>
<p>Those who were as famous as Juchang in the study of plate versions were none other than Miao Yifeng. However, Juchang once ridiculed Yifeng for possessing the skills of Liqiu. The so-called Liqiu refers to the ghosts of Liqiu who can transform into human form, according to the "Lushi Chunqiu". So Juchang's ridicule of Yifeng was already very extreme. In his later years, Yifeng relied on compiling catalogs or appraising fine books for a living. Juchang also once proofread the Four Histories for Liu Hanyi. The two often met at sea, but why were they so outwardly harmonious but inwardly estranged? This cannot be investigated.</p>
<p>Juchang was also proficient in the study of epigraphy, and wrote a book called "Yushi". He also had many rubbings of inscriptions, which he sold for rice in his later years. He died in the Republic of China Dingyi at the age of sixty-nine, without an heir. His diary was deleted and edited by Wang Jilie, and his daughter's husband, Wang Xinkui, published it in stone print. The diary contains quite a few anecdotes from the late Qing Dynasty, but unfortunately, the words in which he ridiculed people have been deleted, so it cannot be called perfect. Fortunately, his manuscript was donated to the Suzhou Provincial Gang Library the year before last. Scholars who study the history of the hall and plate versions can easily go there to see his true handwriting.</p>
<p>The Name in the Clouds Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Inscription on a Orchid Painting</p>
<p>Gao Yang's short brush cannot capture the spirit,</p>
<p>The mood at dawn has already turned to dust,</p>
<p>Leaving behind a cool sadness to inscribe on the painting,</p>
<p>I can send tears to her.</p>
<p>What is there in this world that is truly magnificent?</p>
<p>After drinking, I still seek the lonely shore.</p>
<p>Joy and sorrow fill the sky of Wu with wind and rain,</p>
<p>Current trends praise the Jade Hall in spring.</p>
<p>Evening Drink</p>
<p>Create my Luzhou, issue royal lees,</p>
<p>Rope-like autumn rain earns coolness in return,</p>
<p>The empty hall feels like a triple happiness,</p>
<p>The lonely embrace finds it hard to dispel a hundred thoughts of ash.</p>
<p>The young child has never understood sadness,</p>
<p>War has never spared talents!</p>
<p>Looking back after thirty years, it's all trivial,</p>
<p>I will face the middle stream and strike the oars.</p>
<p>New York Fang Hong</p>
<p>The people under the jurisdiction of New York Mayor William O'Dwyer total eight million. There are more Irish people in New York City than the population of Dublin—500,000, more Jews than the population of Palestine—2 million, and almost as many Italians as the population of Rome—1,095,000. It also has 412,000 Polish people, 57,000 Czechs, 54,000 Norwegians, and 53,000 Greeks. 500,000 black people crowded into New York City. Mayor O'Dwyer is also the commander-in-chief of a huge army—19,000 police officers, 11,000 firefighters, and 120,000 other civil servants.</p>
<p>In one day, New York City uses up more than one billion gallons of water, transports in 23,500 tons of food, and discharges one billion gallons of sewage and more than 8,000 tons of waste. In winter, it needs 20 million gallons of fuel oil every day. Every day, 6 million citizens travel on its 237-foot-long subways and trams, 1.5 million people walk on the road surface, and nearly 400,000 merchants pour into New York City from Long Island, New Jersey, and the suburbs of Connecticut—a train pulls into New York Station every 50 seconds, day and night.</p>
<p>American Locations Cang Yu</p>
<p>The efforts of the United States to solve the housing shortage can be seen from the recently announced figures. From August last year to March this year, a total of 400,024 houses were built, and another 105,742 are under construction. In March alone, 9,451 houses were built.</p>
<p>Major grocery stores in the United States have a new device, which is to irradiate groceries with purple light before housewives leave the store, making the goods less likely to be damaged.</p>
<p>According to the report of the U.S. Department of Education, 1,753 colleges and universities in the United States accommodate more than 2.33 million students, of which veteran students account for 48% of the total. The five universities with the most students in the country are New York University (46,000 people), the University of California (43,000 people), Columbia University (31,000 people), the University of Minnesota (28,000 people), and the University of Illinois (26,000 people).</p>
<p>Pen and Inkstone You Mojun</p>
<p>In Mr. Yiyun's article "Paper and Pen" published in this journal (September) 8, he quoted Li Shi's Continued Record of Natural History: "Wang Rui said, there should be pens since the beginning of writing," and the story of Confucius writing the Classic of Filial Piety with a hairpin and a floating pen, to prove that the pen was not invented by Meng Tian. According to Huainanzi Benjing Xun: "Cangjie created writing, and the ghosts cried at night." What does creating writing have to do with "ghosts" that it makes them "cry at night"? It's too mysterious and incomprehensible! Han Gao You's note says: "Ghost may be written as 'rabbit'. The rabbit is afraid of being taken to make a pen, harming its body, so it cries at night." This explanation is more reasonable. Therefore, if writing was invented by Cangjie, and the "rabbit crying at night" is used as corroborating evidence, then pens already existed during the time of Cangjie. Also, according to Shangshu Zhonghou, a divine turtle carried a picture, and the Duke of Zhou assisted in writing it down. Whether the strange story of the divine turtle carrying a picture is credible is another matter; but the recorder of this event, if there were no pens during the time of the Duke of Zhou, how dare he use the word "pen"? Therefore, to go back a step, pens already existed before Confucius. Liang Zhangju in his Left Trace Collection said this very clearly, but he did not say who created the pen. According to the Record of Things, Yu Shun made a pen and wrote with lacquer on bamboo slips. I don't know if this is credible.</p>
<p>The pen cannot be separated from the inkstone, just like it cannot be separated from paper. Mr. Yiyun has already mentioned in his article that paper was not made by Cai Lun, so I will not discuss it further. Who made the inkstone is worth discussing. Zeng Guofan's Seeking Deficiencies Studio Reading Record says: "The inkstone is also called the ink sea. The Yellow Emperor obtained a jade knot and made it into an ink sea, with the inscription 'Emperor Hong's Inkstone'." According to this, the first person to make an inkstone was the Yellow Emperor, which was at the same time as Cangjie. As for the maker of ink, it is said to be Xing Yi, see Brahma Studio Record. According to Shiben, Zhong You made the inkstone. That is, the inkstone only existed during the Zhou Dynasty. I don't know if this is credible.</p>
<p>During the Han and Wei Dynasties, calligraphers emerged in large numbers, and the inkstone was the most prominent. At that time, tile inkstones were used, so the inkstone was also called "tile inkstone". The Tang Dynasty had the Fengchi inkstone. According to Mi Yuanzhang, it was concave in the middle to hold ink. Concave means it was also like a tile. This inkstone must have been made of stone.</p>
<p>Researchers of inkstone collections say that smoothness is the virtue of the inkstone, and ink production is the talent of the inkstone. Chengni is smooth but does not produce ink, having virtue but no talent; She inkstone produces ink but is not smooth, having talent but no virtue; the one that combines both is the Duan inkstone. As for ancient brick inkstones, they always seem to lack both virtue and talent, so they can only be regarded as antiques.</p>
<p>Professor Slapped Song Qu</p>
<p>According to the "Su Bao" published on the 9th of this month, Professor Zhang, of the Physics Department of National Henan University, went to a certain hotel on Guanqian Street after arriving in Suzhou with the school, wanting to open a room as a temporary place to stay. Unexpectedly, the hotel tea server, upon hearing that Professor Zhang was a refugee from Henan, refused him on</p>

<p>It is learned that in response to the request of American merchants, China's export industry will soon ship 10,000 dan of tung oil to the United States. Shipping is currently being negotiated. Chinese tung oil has always been more profitable when sold to the United States. In the past, it was despised by American merchants due to adulteration of quality. Now, in order to regain past reputation, exporters are striving to improve quality, so the export volume of tung oil has recently been better than before.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Export Goods in Short Supply - Market Presents a Sluggish Situation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the Export Control Committee: The domestic and foreign prices of general export products remained relatively stable last week (September 10 to 17). However, as it is currently a time of shortage of export commodities, and many foreign merchants are also on vacation, there are few large transactions in the market, and the export situation is inevitably somewhat sluggish. Although the tung oil market is stagnant, the price in the producing area has slightly fallen back, and the foreign market price has also recovered to above the price limit. According to the latest London telegraph, the tung oil market turned favorable at the end of the week, and C.I.F. importers were eager to buy. Loose cargo has risen to £158 per ton, and packed cargo has increased to £162. Pig bristle trading is still prosperous. The foreign price of Tianjin No. 33 long bristle (per pound) F.O.B. US dollar price of $9.40 is slightly lower by one dime compared to last week, but the rest remain unchanged. The foreign tea market has been active this week. North Africa and other places are deeply satisfied with our tea samples and have telegraphed orders one after another. Green tea is especially popular, and the estimated order quantity has reached as many as 5,000 tons. The United Kingdom has also opened up imports of high-quality tea, but unfortunately the tea price in the producing area is still rising recently, and the inventory in this street is gradually becoming depleted, and the export prospects are slightly worrying. The export situation of other goods such as cloth, sausage casings, goose feathers, and leather is still good, and the rest are just average.</p>

(2) No. 1 Sand White, 28 yuan, 5 jiao. (3) Taiwan Red Sand, 22 yuan, 5 jiao. (4) Dapu Brown Sugar and Local Green Sugar (Yuan Diao) have the same price. In addition, it was decided that the distribution of sugar for the 14th period household registration in this city will begin on October 10. The price and quality will be discussed at next week's meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Fine Yarn Sold at Similar Prices to Allotment Price - Yarn Market Transactions Slow - Cotton Cloth "Single Carrier" Demand Changed from Fatigue to Firm <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market turned quiet again, and people were very tired. Although the conditions for transshipment to other ports have been opened, yarn merchants still feel that sales are sluggish, and the market is weakening again. The market's intention to advance is weak, and buying is slack.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix was traded at 1050 yuan, similar to the price of Textile Construction allotment. Yesterday, the Shenxin allotment for 21-count Double Horse was 770 yuan. Those in the same industry who were short of funds also sold at 765 yuan. The 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count all continued to weaken.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market trend changed from weak to firm and then stable. At the beginning, it opened at a low level, carrying on the decline of Saturday. Leading fine cloth was traded at 27 yuan and 2 jiao, a further setback of 3 jiao from Saturday's closing price. Leading B fine cloth was originally 24 yuan and 8 jiao, and continued to soften to 24 yuan and 6 jiao. Due to the ban on transportation, the buying interest of customer merchants was relatively slack, but retail sales at the store slightly improved. More and more "single carriers" took goods to Hankou and other places to sell them because of the high prices in the mainland. The market gradually became firm and stable near noon, and the leading fine cloth closed at 27 yuan and 6 jiao, up slightly by 1 jiao. Leading B fine cloth reached a maximum of 25 yuan and 3 jiao, and a minimum of 25 yuan.</p>
<p>Five Happiness and Trumpet Child fine cloth closed at 24 yuan and 5 jiao, each down 1 jiao. There were still many transactions in serge, and the price was stable. Four Gentlemen Yuan serge was last traded at 27 yuan and 9 jiao, and Jumping Carp Yuan serge rose to the limit. The total transaction volume in the city increased slightly, totaling 1,640 pi.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Cotton Industry Association has started to distribute the colored cloth to the cotton cloth merchants on behalf of the dyeing and weaving industry association. It has been determined that the first batch of cloth distribution is 10,604 pi of colored woven cloth and 2,660 pi of printed cloth. Yesterday afternoon, the cotton cloth industry specially allocated and sold at the cotton cloth market, and formed a distribution committee to formulate distribution methods and lottery rules for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Tunxi Mao He Firm and Stable <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The domestic tea market, which has been fluctuating narrowly for several days, still lacked volatility in the two batches of inflows and outflows yesterday. As for the foreign tea market, after the raw tea in the Tunxi producing area tended to rise, the arrival of goods from various sources gradually became scarce. Therefore, the main holders here, in view of the trend of inventory depletion and the increased future cost burden, also showed a tendency to hold on. Although exporters inquired, for this year's Jiangtun Daban and Zhong Qimen, etc., each dan was offered at around 189-190 yuan, and although transactions were launched, the potential was firmer than before.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, currently there are many frequent telegrams from North Africa, mostly requesting tea samples and inquiring about prices. Judging from this situation, it can be seen that the foreign demand for Chinese tea is urgent. Therefore, if Chinese tea merchants can supply smoothly, the export volume this year should be even more considerable.</p>

<p>The rice market was slightly improved, because there were not many arrivals in recent days and the supply was extremely scarce. Furthermore, because the cost was higher than the market price, cargo owners raised prices, and japonica rice saw a slight increase of one or two jiao.
