<h3>總統夫婦返抵首都　離滬前召見首長談話　面諭維護治安穩定物價</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕總統偕夫人，於卅一日晚十時三刻自滬飛返京，旋即赴官邸休息。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕總統昨以全日光陰研究本市一般物價經濟情形，曾分別接見滬市軍政首長·民意機關代表及金融主管人員，垂詢本市之物價，金融，傷兵，難民及救濟特捐等各項問題，對物價及治安尤表關心，當面諭國行俞總裁厲行取締投機囤積，採取有力之金融措施，以穩定物價，並指示警察局長俞叔平，加强檢查倉庫，注意長警生活，總統公畢，已於昨晚九時三十分偕夫人專機返京。</p>
<p>總統昨晨七時許即起身，十時接見吳市長，繼之接見潘議長，有所垂詢，均談二十分鐘。總統對陳誠將軍病況，深表關懷，上午曾派俞濟時局長代表前往探望，後悉陳氏復元不如預期之迅速後，特親筆修書，派員於午後前往慰問。午後總統小作休憩。四時起與親屬歡敘，孔令侃召往謁，談話約四十分鐘，俞鴻鈞亦於六時許趕至官邸晋謁，至六時三刻辭出，據俞氏表示：總統對本市物價情形，特別關懷，曾面諭厲行取締囤積居奇，穩定一般物價，惟今日所談者，僅限於本市之物價問題，與莫千山會議中所討論者爲兩件事。七時，總統偕夫人驅車沿海格路，靜安寺路，南京路外灘一帶巡視市容，並轉往虹橋路萬國公墓，於宋太夫人墓前獻花。</p>
<p>妥籌安置難民傷兵　努力勸募救濟特捐</p>
<p>下午八時半，總統召見中央銀行總裁俞鴻鈞，市長吳國楨，警備司令宣鐵吾，市參議會議長潘公展，市黨部主委方治，警察局長俞叔平等六人，垂詢滬市黨政軍民各方情况甚詳，對物價難民傷兵及救濟特捐等事，均曾提及。當經吳市長等分列扼要報吿，並陳述最近處理情形。總統指示：物價須力求穩定，新米旣可上市，米價尤當注意，勿使騰漲。難民·傷兵更須從速與中央主管機關會商，妥籌安置之方，最好能使移墾。本市徵兵兵額中，可酌撥六千名指定編入淞滬警備旅，加强維護地方治安，新兵營房亦有妥適之計劃，由市府與行政院及國防部商洽決定。本市救濟特捐配額八萬五千億之數，認爲依現時物價計算，實已大爲减低，應努力勸募，務使超過原額，俾爲全國模楷。吳市長等當答以已定在日內開會，積極策動募捐工作，以副中央之期望。會議於九時十分結束後，總統等一行匆匆赴龍华機塲，吳市長，潘議長，宣司令等均往歡送，機塲戒備森嚴，總統夫婦及一行隨員於九時三十分登四引檠專機返京。</p>
<h3>經濟金融新政策方案為改革幣制前奏　本月五日可能公布施行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕在莫干山決定之經濟金融新政策方案，可能於八月五日公布施行，外傳自一日即公布施行說，卅一日權咸方面人士尙未加以證實。財長王雲五，財次徐柏園卅一日出席政務會議後，爲記者等包圍時，均力言一日決不致有任何方案之公布。據悉：此項方案雖已由總統召集翁院長，王財長，俞總裁等商定，但尙須經政務會議通過，故公布日期勢將延至五日左右。至方案之內容，權威方面已證實並非即爲改革幣制，但成信可以視爲改革幣制之準備工作。此方案中包括經濟，金融之整個一套辦法，但在經濟改革之過程中，又爲經濟改革之開始。在此方案實行後，根據實際需要及客觀之條件，將有另外成套之辦法遂步付之實行，直至經濟趨於完全穩定，改革幣制圓滿完成爲止。此項方案以金融政策及外匯政策爲兩大支柱，舉凡控制市塲，管制金融機構，檢查行莊·倉庫等，均包括在內，惟此乃一和平的·合法的經濟政策，並非以人爲對象，採取沒收措施，決不用劇烈之手段。相信此政策不至影響多種人生活，而對於國際並有良好之影響，此方案與過去之經濟改革方案及經濟措施不同者，即此次係採重點主義，並非如過去之只重條文。同時，事前更有極安愼而週密之考慮，依據此方案之金融政策，今後對游資之作崇，將有最週密之管理，使之不能興風作浪，對於行莊非法放款，將儘量約柬，並壓制通貨使之流通市塲，以收平抑物價，穩定金融之效，迨經濟穩定·國際國內收支均趨平衡，即正式從事幣制之改革，此項措施及方案正爲改革幣制之前奏。</p>
<h3>俞鴻多談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁俞鴻鈞，前奉召赴莫干山晋謁總統，業已公畢返滬。據俞氏談稱：此行任務，係商討穩定經濟之具體辦法。自國家總預算經立法院通過後，執行方面，關係財政經濟，至爲重要。對如何平衡收支，覈實支出，增加外匯，改善僑匯，充裕稅收，以及如何增强管制金融，取締囤積居奇，均爲商討之課題。此外，關於中央各主管部會如何聯繫，中央與地方如何配合，亦均加以全盤檢討。對以往措施之缺點及今後改善方針，總統均有週詳之指示。俞氏並述及關於美援之運用當有助於我經濟之改善，但一切仍以自助爲先，以上所舉各點，即係配合美援力求自助之道。至運用原則，一方固應遵守雙邊協定，一方則應求達到穩定經濟之目的，凡此有關經濟問題，在此次會談中，均定有具體醉法，一政院批唯後，即可實施。最後俞氏以樂觀之語調稱：目前輸出可望增加，僑匯亦逐漸改善，僑資及國人在外資產投資國內生產事業辦法，巳公布實行，國內生產事業將有新發展。加以美援第二批物資源源可到，今後經濟情形，決能趨於穩定。</p>

<h3>本年下半年度預算論　—兼論財政金融改革政策—</h3>
<p>本年度下半年度預算槪算書巳由行政院送經立法院審查討論，並作最後之核定。據財政部發表，預算之槪算總額約一千萬億，稅項收入估計五百萬億，赤字額約爲五百萬億。在戡亂之非常時財政，能保持我債各半，已可謂不可多得之現象，面况經立法院之增加歲入，核减支出，其赤字額當然更少。但此爲預算之槪算數字，究非國庫實收實支數字，更非決算數字，故是否能保持稅債各半，自然尙成問題。</p>
<p>吾人先從此次半年度國家總預算總額數字研究，依據最近物價上昇之縐勢，是否足夠？最近物價約爲戰前民國二十六年度上半年之四百萬倍，倘以此預算總額按物價指數換宣戰前法幣，實際僅値戰前二億五千萬元。又倘以今日黑市美匯換算，則僅値美金一億二千五百萬元。依據財政部報吿，民國二十四年度國庫實支計有十三億三千六百萬元，民國二十五年度亦有十八億九千三百萬元，當時雖亦有內亂，但其戡亂區域尙無今日之大，其支出已需十三億至十八億元，故本年度下半年僅値戰前法幣二億五千萬元之預算，事實上恐難維持。</p>
<p>其次，吾人來看本年度下半年度赤字額五百萬億，此五百萬億如以黑市美匯換算，僅値美元六千二百五十萬元而已，倘本年度稅項收入如能如數繳納國庫，則此赤字額當決無求救於中央銀行發行局之必要。蓋僅以美國此次援華借款總額六分之一之數已足彌補。據七月十一日電報，美國援華總署發表，第三季供應中國之撥款，將高達六千萬至七千萬美元，是則僅第三季美國撥款之數，已可彌補我半年度預算之赤字額。</p>
<p>但吾人倘由財源方面估計，本年下半年度預算歲入方面原定稅項收入五百萬億元；美國援業四億美元。四億美元中依協定規定經濟援助二億七千五百萬元，特種援助一億二千五百萬元，定自本年四月起至明年四月止全數撥淸。今假定此款在本年度中可動用二億五千萬元，換算法幣當爲二千萬億元。此外據南京十一日電報，財政部爲增加下半年度國庫收入，擬出售美國剩餘物資及租借物資，約値一百五十七萬億元，出售敵偽財產物資約値十萬億元，出售日本賠償物資約値三萬七千餘億。吾人僅以上述數種財源估計，本年下半年度國床收入可達二千八百七十萬億元。同時因貨物稅等之從價徵收，由於物價上昇，或可增加一倍。此外更有撥充中央銀行爲法幣準備之國營事業約値美金四億，如果動員爲戰時財源，則巳値三千二百萬億元。是以據筆者估計，本年下半年度預算如以量入爲出來編製，則可達七千萬億左右，且不需發行公債，更不必求救於中央銀行發行局。</p>
<p>筆者認爲；政府倘有決心，以此量入爲出政策儘量提高預算歲出，則或能到達戡亂必勝建國必成之目的。今僅以等於戰前法幣二億伍千萬元之預算，欲期平定內亂與完成建國，殆爲遠離事實之催眠術。</p>
<p>最近立法院對此一千萬億亦即等於戰前法幣二億伍千萬元之預算案，猶事多方削减，其對於現實，距離更覺太遠。同時筆者對於財政部提出此千萬億槪算案，亦覺失去時局性。筆者不敏，願依據以量入爲出之原則，而試編本年下半年度預算槪算如后：</p>
<p>民國三十七年下半年度國家預算槪算試擬案</p>
<p>歲人之都</p>
<p>一，租稅收入（包括行政收入等）　一千萬億元</p>
<p>二，借款收人（美金二億五千萬元）　二千萬億元</p>
<p>三，國有財產收入</p>
<p>（一）美國剩餘物資及租借物資變價收入　三百萬億元</p>
<p>（二）敵偽財產物資　價收入　一百萬億元</p>
<p>（三）日本賠償物資變價收入　五十萬億元</p>
<p>（四）國營事業變價收入　三千二百萬億元</p>
<p>四，國有營業利潤收入　一千萬億元</p>
<p>歲入總計　七千陸百五十萬億元</p>
<p>歲出之部</p>
<p>一，軍費支出　三千五百萬億元</p>
<p>二，經濟建設支出　二千五百萬億元</p>
<p>三，其他政務支出　一千六百五十萬億元</p>
<p>歲出總計　七千陸百五十萬億元</p>
<p>提高軍費支出，可以充實作戰實力及增强士氣。提高經濟建設，可以充實國防，增加國富及國民所得，亦即培養財源。其他政務費支出之提高，可以提高公敎人員待遇而增强行政效率及維持文化水準。</p>
<p>倘照此預算歲出總額七千六百五十萬億元，以最近物價指數四百萬倍核算約爲戰前法幣十九億元。今政府有此數額之財源，似可大加利用，庶可一鼓蕩平匪氛。戡亂時期旣可縮短，經濟危機亦可消除，更可使國富及國民所得比例增加。如戡亂一旦結束，則東北華北等大量富源可以開發，更因各地交通之恢復，各地特產物資可以互通有無，從而物價自趨平穩。</p>
<p>中國雖經抗戰八年，中國雖經內亂三年，而中國實尙有自助之能力。蓋今中國共產黨雖盤據中國富源地帶之東北及華北之一部份，但因其無法從事開採，故中國眞正之國家財富仍在中國國家手中。加之政府因有美國財政之援助，以及國有財產中敵偽財產物資，日本賠償物資，美國剩餘物資及租借物資大量之掌握，更有鉅値之國有營業機構，故國家實未貧窮，其所以貧窮者，政府一部份大員旣動搖其信心，而又未能善自利用其財富耳。例如抗戰結束　巳三年，而敵偽產業中之逆　迄今尙懸擱中，而大部未予處理。更有大量政府物資竟任箕堆積於荒塲，任其風吹雨打而未嘗愛惜，未加重視。最近日本賠償物資已源源運來，但更未聞政府標買或讓售於國民。俗語所謂「摔米囤餓死，」眞不啻爲現在的政府寫照！</p>
<p>最近數年來財政上對於國民予以最大不良印象者，莫過預算與國庫收支數字距離之遙遠。一方固因物價不斷上昇，以致不斷用緊急命令追加預算，他方亦爲政府財政政策未有深謀遠慮，徒然用壓低預算的虛飾手段所致。要知在此非常時期，必須用非常政策，以適應非常之需要。在非常時期而僅以頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚，或甚至頭痛醫脚脚痛醫頭之方法來應非常之變，當然不切實際。由於政府財政經濟政策之不健全，遂使失信於民心。今　法幣爲例：今日物價之日高，其總因由於人民不願以法幣存於手中，存入銀行則更無可能，彼等一有法幣，立即掉換物資，黃金，外幣或其他如銀元等物。正因人人如此，法幣流通於市塲之速度增加，流通之數量亦泛濫。設人人信任法幣，人人以法幣存儲於銀行，而普通行壯亦不以存款爲囤貨，投機，或購置黃金美鈔之資金，則銀行自可恢復控制國民購買力之原有機能，而金融市塲亦必步入正軌，物價趨於穩定，而人民之法幣購買力仍得穩定。故今日政府之財政經濟政策，當以絕對停止增發法幣爲第一義。（下文轉入第五版）</p>

<h3>調查七五事件真相　秦德純今晨飛平　七五調查會宣布調查已獲結果</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕奉派赴平調查七五事件之秦德純次長，定一日晨飛平。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕關於東北學生七五事件之善後處理，前經政院翁院長分電東北衛總司令，藩陽市長董文琦，北平市長劉瑤章等，並訓令敎育部指示辦法，善爲處理。茲悉行政院爲愼重起見，除派秦次長德純飛平，實地調查眞相，會同處理外，並改由翁院長分別致電東北衛總司令，華北傳總司令等。大意略謂：東北學生七五事件，總統備極關注，正盼妥善處理。除各項辦法前已電達，本院茲派秦次長總純即日飛平，實地查明情形，會商處理一切。</p>
<p>又據有關方面探悉：政府對於東北學生素極關懷，並曾設法改進學生生活，本年六月初行政院特撥東北各大學應變費一千億元，交由東北剿匪總部統籌辦理，嗣後指令敎育部墊發東北大學在平臨時大學開辦費六百一十五億元，學生膳費二百六十億元，最近更加撥補習班經費二百億元，北平臨中開辦費一百億元，天津臨中開辦費一百億元，政府自五月份起以至現在，專爲東北學生核撥之費用共二千二百餘億元，且均係在國家總預算尙未經立法院核議前撥發。際茲國家財政困難萬分，政府關注東北靑年，不能謂不周至。</p>

<h3>盟總不顧他國利益建立日貿易政策　吳半農率直予以指責</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京卅日電〕最近抵此之美國駐滬副領事史璜克，今曾趨訪中國代表團經濟組長兼賠償及歸還委會主委吳半農，討論中日貿易問題。據悉：在二人晤談中，吳氏曾率直指責盟總不顧其他遠東國家利益，以建立日本貿易之政策，乃缺乏遠見之行動。吳氏並指出現在中日貿易之最大阻碍，盟總意欲以中國其他政府機樅之輸入抵償中央信託局一千萬美元之債務，結果，中國資委會乃將鐵苗售與外國公司，使其轉售與盟總，而不直接售與盟總。中信局現仍繼續自中國運轍貨物來日，並計劃於年內償淸其債務，故盟總所採政策，殊令人不能了解。吳氏於論及盟總不顧其他國家之利益時，指出盟總曾拒絕開灤煤礦局以煤交換日本礦木之建議。吳氏稱：盟總拒絕之理由，爲日本儘可能保護森林以防火災，但另一方面，日本之官員及工業家則表示願意派代表至開灤，以便用礦木交換煤。歸還永利化學廠</p>
<h3>日政府監製新白金綱節</h3>

<p>〔中央社柬京卅日電〕盟總將於九月以新製之白金製網篩，撥交最近始歸還我國之最大硝酸製造廠，且在國內極受重視之永利化學工廠。新白金網篩刻正由日政府監製，以代替在尙未歸還前暫爲日本保管期間於工廠內被盜之重七斤之白金網篩。按是項網篩，係製硝酸時不可少之觸媒劑，亦爲復工之絕不可少者。據該廠駐此間代表稱：該廠重建事約可於本月底竣事。另悉：我國規模最大之廣東紙廠，戰爭期間經日本全部移往北海道，亦將於九月底前完全拆卸，十月初開始搬運。</p>
<h3>在青焚燬民航隊機　失事原因又一說</h3>
<p>載重逾量重量偏於一隅</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民用航空隊遝輸機一架，二十九日在靑島附近失事焚燬，其原因頃有人猜測係受共匪之陰謀破壞，惟此說似無充份證據足資徵信。據此間一般人士推測，該機載重逾量或有重大影響，蓋普通運輸機載重以四萬磅爲最大限度，而該機則達四萬六千餘磅。月擊者談該機起飛至離跑道約一百英尺時，突然以四十五度角度急升後下墜，可能係機中堆置軍火等物，重量偏於一隅，因此使一部份機件失靈而發生慘劇。罹難之中國官兵十六人姓名，此間無法獲悉，民用航空隊根本無載客名單之存案。又該隊雖爲民航機構，但因性質比較特殊，此次失事似並未引起社會一般人士之驚恐與責難，交部民航局亦未聞派員前往調查云。</p>

<h3>多瑙河會議席上蘇代表態度強硬　堅拒西文國家所提條件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十一日廣播：貝爾格勒訊，　外次維辛斯基在多瑙河會議中，怒斥美·英法三國代表候車判斷多瑙河會議。維氏稱，「吾人現正遭遇出席本會議三國代表之跡近「哀的美敦」之最後要求。此項要求之提出，係在擬訂任何草約之前，對於建議之實質及新約所依據之原則，均茫無所知。此實為獨裁者之口吻，而非合作之言詞，蘇聯必嚴詞拒絕之。就蘇　代表團而言，吾人氣絕此種不合國際集會體統之言詞。凡美·英·法三國代表團企圖加於吾人之任何壓力，吾人決不予以考慮」云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十一日廣播：蘇聯外次維辛斯基今日在多瑙河會議中告西方強國代表，謂各強如堅持提出條件，則門戶大開，等候彼等離去。措詞強硬，西方強國代表一致表示憤慨。</p>
<p>〔合衆社貝爾格勒卅一日電〕法國今日在此間多瑙河會議中，向蘇聯集團多數挑戰。法代表蒂艾利稱，除非多瑙河現行章程之簽字國（包括美國）一致同意，法政府不願受任何新多瑙河公約之拘束。又稱，多數派雖聲勢浩大，亦不容改變現行章程。按東西會議中，蘇集團之佔多數者，尙以此次為創舉。蒂氏之言乃展開程序法規之討論。保加利亞外長卡門諾夫今日輪值大會主席。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒三十日電〕今日多瑙河會議舉行揭幕禮後，即以語文問題引起西方列强與人民民主國間之爭論。大會決定以俄文與法文為正式語文，而非除英文，英文僅被認為第三種工作語文。大會由南斯拉夫外長薛米克揭幕，旋由蘇聯代表維辛斯基提出上案，經三小時之辯論，卒以七對三票（美英法）予以通過。嗣太會一致推定南外交部司長梅茲任秘書長。南外長於揭幕時致詞，略謂今願乘此機會，聲明南政府希望此次會議之結果，復可證明經濟制度互相不間之諸國間有成立國際和平合作之可能性，並證明常常可能融和多瑙河濱今具有充分主權各國之利益，此項利益由多瑙河實遠之交通而相聯繫。南斯拉夫已以事實非以空言證明其決計就完全平等之基礎，參加謀固國際團結與經濟合作之任務。繼提議每日開會應由各代表團輪流爲主席。</p>

<h3>國特使覓取途徑擬直接晤史達林　並分別與蘇聯外次會談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓三十一日廣播：美國務院發言人稱，美，英，法三國使節於三十日夜先後訪問蘇外交部，商談關於柏林問題。渠謂此次會談爲西方國家謀解除柏林封銷計劃之最初步驟。渠不願透露此次會談之性質，僅謂美大使中密斯於下午六時往訪蘇外次佐林，法大使夏台諾於四小時後往訪，英國則由羅伯茲偕駐蘇大使館代辦哈里遜於十時往見佐林。莫洛托夫以「在假」拒見三强使節，以及此次三國代表與佐林會談後，就情勢推度，美英法三國使簡或將另覓途徑，俾與史達林直接談判柏林問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕據悉，美英法三國對柏林對鎖事件，願與史達林元首直接商談。據莫斯科美國大使館報吿稱，莫浴托夫外長現正休假」，故「不能」作決定之討論。若史達林亦不能見面，此間人士認爲莫斯科對封鎖所引起之任何事件，應負完全責任。西方諸國之代表均欲會見莫洛托夫，提出三强對於封鎖之意見，並探聽蘇聯對停止封鎖所索之代價。衆信，若蘇聯肯解隊封鎖，則彼等將提出討論柏林·德國·及其他歐洲問題。美　無疑地贊成直接會見史達林，蓋局勢之爆炸的可能性甚大，決非外交屬員所能完全處理。國務院對莫洛托夫之休假是否即爲「躱避」一節，不願發表意見。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅日電〕此間政治與外交界之意見，認爲莫洛托夫之離開莫斯科，有數種解釋，其一爲克林姆宮得悉西方盟國有對蘇聯作讓步之意，故決計博取時間，並增加如果舉行四國談話時其所挾持者之數目與性質。另一較樂觀之意見，以爲蘇聯外次維辛斯基今日在貝爾格萊德參加多瑙河會議開幕禮，此一展緩能使維氏獲有在會中與美代表團接觸之機會。</p>
<h3>柏林東西兩區貨幣糧食戰</h3>

<h3>美國共和黨議員反對管制物價　擬促國會早休會</h3>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕當塔虎脫發表前項聲明時，正値其他共和黨議員迅連推翻民主黨議員之建議，按民生黨員曾提議邀請共和黨總統候選人杜威出席國會申明渠對物價高漲事之意見。同時參院中對公權問題採取拖延政策者，仍繼績其用　之戰術。塔虎脫預料將於八月四日「處　」反人頭稅法案，但朱說明如何處置之。</p>
<h3>蘇聯以電力原料誘德工業界合作</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林三十一日電〕蘇聯三十一日以供應受封鎖窒息之柏林工業以電力及原料爲餌，要求工業界與蘇聯合作。此建議首見於蘇系「大柏林貿易公司」，其後蘇聯之德意志新聞社即加以傳播。該社稱，如英美法部份之德工業願唯蘇聯之馬首是瞻，大柏林公司應供應以必要之補給，包括電電在內，並保證蘇佔區及控制區可爲其市塲。</p>
<h3>共黨領袖抨擊政府　義總理痛加駁斥　誓為保障民主抵抗暴力</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬卅日電〕義總理加斯貝利三十日晚在國會中面紅耳赤，怒吿義共速停止宣傅革命，否則須自食其來。共黨領袖朗果曾指斥國會，加氏遂予以長達二十分鐘之即　答覆稱：「余現警吿朗果停止向暴力方面前進。閣下如欲威脅凡屬於欲保護彼等資產與權益之階級人士，則余可對閣下表明，吾人之責任不僅在於保障民主，且在保障人民與勞工階級避免遭受此項恐怖，甚至給予鼓勵使有作戰勇氣。一此為加氏任總理以來最具戰鬥性之演說。</p>
<p>綠朗果曾宣讀一文，抨擊加氏與國會達一小時之久，傳此文爲陶格里亞蒂所撰。加氏答覆之有力，使朗果極爲震驚。朗氏提及共黨不信任政府之建議時稱，此項提議已予收回，「蓋政府黨佔大多數，故在議會中任何討論根本無用」。朗氏痛斥政府之控制國會，並謂：「政府已採取危險之政策。政府禁止私藏軍械之法律，及其他警察國家性質之措置，已使政府走上納粹與法西斯所遵行之道路。」朗氏此言，使加斯貝利勃然大怒，起身駁覆。</p>

<h3>塔虎脫主張　鋼鐵應配售與華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕共和黨議員塔虎脫今吿參院稱，渠認爲美國「應於配售鋼鐵於國內工廠前，先配售出口至南美及中國之鋼鐵。」詢以鋼鐵輸出至南美及中國，是否將影響鋼鐵便格之增加。塔氏認爲不然。渠謂减少出口，不能抑低其價格，蓋美國內之需求，必將吸收全部鋼鐵，惟增加鋼鐵之供應，將增加鋼鐵製品之數量。塔氏稱，渠主張節省政府各部之開支，包括經濟合作總部之開支，並認爲總統應於現有辦公費內，儘量節省其用度。渠稱，總統有權不經國會同意减少鋼鐵及其他稀有物資之出口。</p>

<h3>美戰時間諜活動　牽涉李普曼</h3>
<p>美間諜女郎向參院透露</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓三十一日廣播關於美商務部職員雷明頓被控將戰爭秘密洩漏於蘇聯間諜一案，三十一日美參議員召傳雷氏至參院調查委員會辦公室訊問，雷氏膛目四顧，未入證人席即聲言該項控吿「並非事實」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三十日電〕神秘之美國女郎班特萊供稱：美國財務部某高級官員實爲蘇聯在美國之間諜領袖之一，以B二九型超級飛行堡壘之情報供給蘇聯。據共黨機關報每日工人所刊之照片，班特萊爲一中年女子，頭髮深黑。消息靂通方商稱：班特萊所供出之間諜網，較加拿大原子間諜案之範圍更廣。若千方面指出班特萊與最近共黨領袖之被捕有關。然其他方面則極力否認此說，力言共黨領袖現均交保釋放，班特萊現已不再爲一美麗女郎，而爲一臃腫之婦人。渠在參院非美活動委員會供稱：在一九三五年至一九四四年渠受共黨之指令，將政治與軍事之情報供給蘇聯，渠指出商務部高級官員賴明頓，（彼時任對歐洲出口執照審查委員會主席）在戰時曾以美國飛機生產之詳細情報向渠洩漏，此種秘書情報，由前商務部著名著名記者李普曼抄一副本交渠，目前李普曼在北卡洛林那。　特萊又稱：渠之與蘇聯間諜接觸，由於渠之信仰共產主義，渠認爲美國給予蘇聯之帮助甚嫌不足。</p>

<h3>日閣頒布反罷工法後將激起日總罷工　勞工界認為麥師函件并非法令</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京卅一日電〕日本內閣卅一日頒佈命令頻止政府僱員罷工，雖勞工領袖已警吿如此一行動發生，則將命令全國五百萬公私工人罷工，以資　復。內閣命令係根據麥帥廿二日致盧田函件中之建議而頒發。</p>
<p>內閣之「不準罷工」一令立即生效，在議會通過新立法案修正全國公務員法律前，命令始終有效。勞工領袖早已高呼，除非議會通過「不準罷工」令，彼等不擬　從，故內閣之命令，足以促使局勢緊張。工界之言論，在法律按術上與違抗麥帥統治相云僅及毫髮。觀察家變為盟總必將挺身支持內閣之「不準罷工」法令。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京卅一日電〕據今日公報宣稱：日政府三聯合黨領袖，關於未來反罷工法之內容，，已獲致完全協議。盧田首相今日下午在議會與前首相片山，及協同黨總裁三木舉行會商，三政黨領袖決定議會將於九耳中召開，會期約爲廿日左右，以便通過根據麥帥要求而經日政府制定之修改公務員法律地位之政令。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京卅一日電〕日產業工人大會領袖土橋今晨吿盟國記者稱：遞信與交通工人之總罷工，將於八月七日實行。渠稱：渠不承認麥帥致蘆瘆田苜相之函件，係一正式命令。「如此項函件較之憲法更有權威，則日本不再係一法治國矣。渠對盟軍總部勞工處處長基倫爲抗議反罷工立法而辭職，大爲推崇。</p>
<h3>日海上警察威協國家</h3>

<h3>一個蘇退伍軍官口述的史達林作戰計劃（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報編輯室譯</p>
<p>此外，蘇聯高級指揮部知道美國己在接近蘇聯之基地內（如土耳其·希臘·中國·德國）建立一種類如雷達的設備，運用此項設備，美國可能偵悉蘇聯原子彈工廠之所在地。爲防止秘密洩漏起見，大批「反原子雷達」之設備，正在積極建設中。</p>
<p>其次，蘇聯參謀本部所關心者，爲石油問題。他們鑒於美國有用原子彈破壞蘇聯近海油田之可能，於是遂於裏海沿岸安置了一巨大金屬網。此網之安置，可阻止由無綫電控制之原子彈，使之不能轟擊蘇聯之油田。</p>
<p>V字武器　蘇聯於原子彈方面之成就，雖較美國落後，但其於V字武器方面之優勢，却遠非美國所能及。此種自動推進之長距離空中武器，在最近靠近堪察加半島之某西伯利亞實騐站之試驗中，已能於九百至一千三百英里之距離內，描準攻擊寬約三至大英里之「標，而不致有失。</p>
<p>如衆所知，蘇聯之主要力量，在於其龐大之陸軍。馬歇爾最近曾謂：「所有美國作戰部隊，皆可舒舒服服坐於勃魯克林之籃球場中而不覺擁擠」。而蘇聯之陸軍，根據蘇聯參謀本部之秘密指令，在一九四八年底，蘇聯平時常備兵力將達一百二十師之多，包括空運部隊三十師·裝甲部隊二十師·步兵四十師（其中廿五師係機械化部隊），騎兵十五師（機械化者八師），砲兵十五師（機械化者十師）。雙方實力比較相差懸殊，美國寶遠落於蘇聯之後。</p>
<p>除此，爲了防衛他們的工業，避免遭受原子彈之轟炸，蘇聯尙計劃建築兩倍至三倍的鐵路。這樣，當某一地區之工業暫時被毀後，可立即將其設備移轉於另一地區，繼續生產。同時又由於蘇聯之工業，係分散於區域遼闊之各個地區，所以實際上要大大减輕了原子彈之咸脅。</p>
<p>的確，原子彈並不足以使蘇聯頭痛。蘇聯所眞正感到不安的，不是原子彈而是石油問題。如在戰爭進行之初，油田即被炸毀，則蘇聯將無一法獲得足夠之燃料，以完成其三個階段之戰爭。如果蘇聯只能完成第一階段，而無法完成第二階段，則戰爭主動勢必轉操於美國之手。同時原先預期單獨於中國進行決戰之計劃亦將失敗。如此，即將被迫於俗中國·近東·中東·歐洲（西班牙至英國一綫）三地同時作戰。這樣三面作戰之危險，可能造成悲慘之結果。萬一不幸，戰局果發展至此地步。則最後蘇聯勢將採取長期作戰之策略。因有此一可能，故使蘇聯不得不以極大之恐懼來預料下次大戰之爆發。</p>

<p>上海市生活費指數審議委員會，於昨日上午十時在市府會議室舉行第十六次會議，統計長報告物價上漲情形如下：物價上漲在百分之二十以下者，有靑菜紙烟等。百分之廿一至卅之間者，有秈米，韮菜，鹹魚，茶葉等。百分之卅一至四十之間者，有豆腐，荳油等。百分之四十一至五十之間者，有麵粉，鮮牛肉，乳腐，斜紋布等。百分之五十一至六十之聞者，有黃豆，粗布，絨布等。百分之六十一至七十之間者，有豆芽，火柴，綫呢，肥皂等。百分之七十一至八十之間者，有士林布，草紙等。百分之八十一至九十之間者，有鮮魚，綫襪等。七月份下半月公用事業，戶口配米價格不動。主席報吿畢，經各委員鄭重審議，認爲滿意，簽字於指數單，十時三十分散會。</p>
<p>上下半月分別編製</p>
<p>市府統計長張宗孟，昨於主持生活費指數審議會後向記者聲明：本市生活費指數，七月份分上下兩期發表後，尚有少數人士，以爲下半月指數即代表七月份全月者，實屬誤會。七月份上半月與下半月指數，計算編製方式，完全獨立，正與以往按月發表指數情形相同。又七月份下半月公用事業，戶口米價格無變動，其中一週物價且有下跌，故本期指數上漲情形，較爲平穩云。</p>

<h3>銀樓飾金只進不出</h3>
<p>銀樓業之飾金買賣，昨日雖有牌價，實際上僅有收進，而一律拒絕兌出。據該業中人發表，拒絕出售之理由有二，（一）金價因結匯證明書價格上漲而提高，一般市民以爲金價漲風又至，競相爭購，可能造成眞眞之漲風，故暫停出售。　中央銀行至今未允配給金塊或金條，若大量售出，短期內即可售罄。該業目前僅盼顧客以舊飾金換製新飾金，略收工資，以維特職工生活。</p>
<h3>輪船客貨運明日將漲價</h3>
<p>據上海輪船業公會及國營招商局消息：三十一日已電呈交通部要求核准該公會三十日理監事聯席會議議決之運價調整率，其調整之比例爲：南北洋沿海綫客貨運一律照原價加百分之八十，長江綫上海至宜昌段因跑單帮乘客特別擁擠，故客運價特別提高，照原價增百分之一百二十，並擬於下週一（八月二日）起舉行。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市公用局局長趙曾珏，昨晨往國行訪兪總裁，商討對公用事業公司燃料貸款問題，兪氏對貸款原則完全同意，趙局長旋即辭出。至於貸款數目及具體辦法，於午後五時，由公用局副局長張仁滔與國行副總裁劉攻芸商談，惟仍無結果，定明日續商。據公用局方面表示：八月份公用事業新價格，可能於八月三日開會審核決定，縱使貸款成功，新價亦必可觀，但若貸款不克實現，則更將不堪設想。據一般人預料，八月份新價可能上漲一倍以上。</p>

<h3>深感失學痛苦　慨捐一億元助學</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市娼妓以當局尚乏澈底之管理，致年來隨經濟情形之劇變，而操此皮肉生涯者，日見增加，從而使一般性病亦因此益爲猖獗。現本市性病防治所雖每月實行檢驗已向警局登記之公娼一次，但據該所所長郁維語記者，此種工作困難極多，蓋一般娼妓皆不願前往警局登記，所登記者僅及全數十分之一，而能按時至該所接受檢驗者，又祗登記者中之十分之一，强迫治療，無法澈底施行。同時一般新娼暗娼及變相妓女，則更多方規避。現該所統計每月約檢驗娼妓三千人，實際本市娼妓至少有十萬人以上，其中淋病一項幾乎人皆有之，梅毒則約佔百分之六十五左右。再根據各方資料統計，全市市民約有百分之十五患梅毒，百分之四十惠有淋病，其嚴重情形較癆病尤有過之，故娼妓即使經檢驗合格，准許營業，亦難保其不於二五分鐘內，又染上性病。渠稱，香港人口一百萬，性病防治所有五所之多，本市五百萬人口，僅有一處，故性病之防治，實難望有滿意成績。</p>
<p>快治方法十天可愈</p>
<p>惟該所仍竭力研究快洽方法，以最新之配尼西林油劑，每日注射一次，早期梅毒僅須十天即可治痊，有効程度在百分之九十六以上。一面則着重於敎育方式，儘可能减少傳染機會。此後擬展開患有性病者之家庭訪視，妊娠婦女之梅毒檢查，提倡婚前結婚檢查，並一次抽調二十五個妓院內妓女各一人，施以三個月之性病敎育，使其自發的覺悟於性病之可怕，普遍獲知預防方法。</p>
<p>每月治療千一百人</p>
<p>該所除經常作娟妓檢查外，同時亦展開市民性病之治療工作，現平均每月約治療一五〇〇人。郁所長認爲性病並非不治之症，亦絕不可諱疾忌醫，致貽害子孫。時至令日，早期性病之治療，其極易痊愈，已爲衆所周知之事實。</p>
<p>目下如本市之大都會中，欲求性病絕跡，固不可能，惟如對娼妓全部作一嚴格之登記，並如歐美各國劃定風化區，妥爲管理，有病者集中醫治，無病者由妓院老　負責預防，則對减少性病傳染機會至最低限度，當屬可能。</p>

<h3>本所下半年度預算論</h3>
<p>上接二版星期論壇</p>
<p>吾人要知，中國在抗戰期間及戰後曾獲得不少國際信用之援助，此項國際信用即外國借款之獲得，亦即表示國際間對中國國富評價之結果。蓋外國對於一國之借款，除政治關係外更有經濟關係之考慮。中國如無相當數額國富價値之存在，國際信用之獲得額勢必甚少，如無政治關係而僅依賴經濟關係，則亦可能分文無着。乃今日之中國，祗成爲外國所信任，而反不爲本國人自己所信任，甚至不爲中國政府中一部分大員自己所信任，實爲普天下最奇怪之現象。同時亦充分表示中國國民乃至官吏國家意識之低薄。尤其在都市市塲之表現，充分表示一般投機商人之所爲，正與叛國行爲相類。例如倘聞中國向美國借款談判形勢不大順利，美金黑市價格隨即飛昇，如聞政府軍隊前綫略有一時失利之消息，則一切商品價格又突然飛昇。諸如此類之政治軍事外交動態之一舉一動，每為　機份子之投機資料，能不悲夫！</p>
<p>奉勸吾政府官吏與人民，必須首先認識中國國富之潛在價値如何巨大。依據筆者估計，中國國富價値約値戰前法幣二萬億元，以今日四百萬倍物價推算今日法幣，則値法幣八百萬萬億。其中包括中國地下資源一萬三千四百六十七億七千萬元戰前法幣。中國實際並非貧窮，如爲一貧窮國家，則日本帝國主義決不願傾其全力而作征服中國之嘗試。今政府對於地下富源旣無高度技術以開發，而對於地上已有之國有財產，亦因主管官吏之顢預抵能而無法處理，對於財政支出旣不能從重點着眼，對彌補赤字則又祗會因襲過去而利用發行，國家財政自然有江河日下之勢了。利用發行以充戰時財源，在戰時財政事實與理論固所承認，但要知在利用發行之後，當須即以公債政策與租稅政策相配合，蓋以戰時軍需浩繁而緊急，欲期由租稅及公債之收入再作支出，則影響於軍事甚大，故先以發行增加收入，而暗中以政府創造之購買力向市塲購入軍需物資與勞務，此原爲暫時的措施而非永久之政策。今政府對於此項臨時性緊急措施之通貨膨脹政策，行之過久，習以爲常，人民已深悉此中情形，故對於法幣信用漸趨低落，以致今日人人不信法幣。因法幣之信用漸趨低落，政府對之亦覺驚惶失措，未嘗爲根本之圖，而人民則竟認爲中國已屆經濟崩潰之前夜。事實演進至今日，政府猶在將錯就錯繼續膨脹法幣發行，但法幣流通之範圍愈趨愈狹，流通之速度愈來愈快，而人民則已在不知不覺中另以商品，黃金，銀元，外幣等等爲其換算之「貨幣」矣。在此情形下，政府如再顢預因循，依然利用通貨膨脹政策，此眞欺人欺己至矣極矣之　　舉措！</p>
<p>吾人平心而論，今日法幣發行累計額如與物價上昇率比較，法幣發行量之實際價値額實比戰前祗低降伍倍至十倍。我國戰前法幣發行量大約爲十四億元，倘以今日物價四百萬倍換算今日法幣，則今日法幣發行量應有伍仟陸百萬億元。且戰前尚未包括東北及臺灣。今日法幣發行量，如包括東北流通券及臺幣，併計恐亦尚未到達壹仟萬億。法幣發行量旣未發至飽和點，但在市塲爲何巳感法幣泛濫於市，此點適足以證明由於法幣信用之低落而使法幣流通範圍愈趨狹隘。今日市塲與民間，實巳於無形中另立一種「通貨」以代替法幣之地位，都市則大都以黃金美鈔，農村大都以銀元與白米。貨幣原爲便利原始時代物物交換而發生，由最初之貝石刀帛而金銀而演進至今日紙幣，但在中國現階段之塲合，貨幣巳形成歷史之倒退現象！</p>
<p>中國財政演進至今日階段，財政政策必須予以通盤之改革，始足應付現實環境。否則本年下半年度預算案，專實上將仍徒成一種形式。此種形式主義，亦即欺飾主義的預算不僅不能負起戡亂建國之重任，且將加深政治與經濟之危機。三年來歷史之敎訓，應可使舉國上下所深切認識，吾人斷乎不能再聽政府大僚因循敷衍而誤國誤民。（上篇完）</p>

<h3>關外行（一）　平沙無垠出嘉峪</h3>
<p>— 本報記者宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報酒泉廿八日航訊〕出了嘉峪關，兩眼淚不乾！這是古人形容前往西域的悲涼幽怨的情緒，但在目前，由於交通的發展，這種情緒已早爲時間所冲淡。這裏所說的關外，自酒泉以西廿四公里之嘉峪關起，包括了漢代所置的敦煌郡，亦即現在的玉門·安西·敦煌三縣，再加上拱衛甘·髯·新·三省的國防前綫馬鬃山，（天山東支，即今之肅北設治局）它的總面積在三十萬九千七百平方公里以上。</p>
<p>在各種遊記裏，不乏酒泉到敦煌的沿　情形的記載，而馬鬃山自外蒙「獨立」之後，它在國防上的重要性，亦漸爲人知。但在「國防與民生並重」的口號下，關外三縣一局的近况如何，這也是國人素所關心的事。記者這次隨蘭州本外埠各報記者觀光團來肅北後，特地到各地向當地的軍政首長民意代表及民衆作多次的訪問。當然，這種走馬觀花的採訪，談不到十分正確，但爲了時間·交通·治安種種條件的限制，多虧當地人士的傾誠相吿，經過幾次的參證·比較，不窺見關外的一般情况。</p>
<p>瞻仰雄關　記者抵酒泉時，是七月九日下午五時許，爲了要馬上去參觀玉門甘靑油礦廠的新井開　情形，次日便首途赴礦，車西行廿餘公里，嘉峪關的雄姿便遙入眼簾，而附近的烽烟墩和密齒也似的電桿，不時自車窗飛過。烽烟墩是古代軍事情報傳遞的利器，和現在遙相呼應的電信設備兩相對照，不勝滄桑之感。</p>
<p>嘉峪關位於祁連山，胭脂山間的嘉峪山西麓。蒙古民歌中云：「失我祁連山，使我六畜不繁殖；失我胭脂山，使我婦女無顏色！」胭脂山的土色非常紅，眞似胭脂，和祁連山終年不消的白雪，相映成趣。</p>
<p>城樓嵯峨　關於嘉峪關的修築年代，衆說不一，但決非秦建。史記：一秦使蒙恬將三十萬衆收黃河以南地，築長城，起臨洮以至遼東，延袤一萬餘里。」那時的河西，是月氏國，本西戎地。秦時的轄境尚不到此，而秦時的臨　，當在現在的甘肅岷縣境。以後到漢武帝闢河西四郡，令路博德築邊墻以禦匃奴，東起皋蘭黃河沿，西至酒泉嘉峪山，這才是嘉峪關的草創時期，嗣後歷代疆域，屢有變更，邊墻自然也迭有損益。一直到明代洪武五年，修殘補缺，嘉峪關乃吿厥成。關有內外兩層，全用巨磚砌成，城樓高矗，嵯峨雄闊，關外城脚兩側，有判斷出關後吉兇禍福的石擊痕跡，名爲「扣關」，據說是投擊石子有回聲，便可生還，否則即將葬身異域，因此，數百年來擊壞的痕跡，雖屢屢塡補，但過路之人，仍是不斷的擊成　粉。關外地勢陡高，所以在照片上很難看出它的高峻，距關一箭之遙，有「天下雄關」石碑矗立，擘窠大字，勁猷可觀，而總統卅一年來遊時手題的「嘉峪關」三字，原來預備　在關頂的，總統回渝後急電此間，不准將原來的古蹟湮沒，因此這三個一尺見方的大字石刻，已另建一紀念碑矗立在祁連山脚了。</p>
<p>殽關丸泥　當年林則徐謫貶新疆路經嘉峪關時，曾寫過一首詩：「嚴關百尺界天西，萬里征人駐馬蹄，飛閣遙連秦樹直，繚垣斜壓隴雲低。天山巉峭摩肩立，瀚海蒼茫入望迷，誰道殽關千古險，回看祗見一丸泥。」</p>
<p>這首詩已可道出當年的眞情實境。我們遊關時，因道人不在，未能買鑰登關遠眺，領略關外蒼茫浩瀚的風光，只是覺得這座長城極西的雄關，已失去國防價値，徒供人憑弔而已。關內附近，新植樹木，達廿萬株，在沒脛的草地上，不時有汨汨的淸泉流過。石油公司的農塲之一，也設在這裏，經常種植小麥和蔬菜，運往礦廠去。關外南爲祁述山，北爲馬鬃山，甘新公路像巨蟒似的縱臥在戈壁灘上，極目遠眺，平沙無垠，荒凉的程度，較關內尤甚。這時風雲變幻，飛砂走石，導行的李淸涵君遙指石油礦廠，正籠罩在烟綃似的雨簾中。</p>

<h3>祁紅趨勢堅俏</h3>
<p>本年度祁門紅茶，在採置成本激昂中，執主售意本極堅化，而昨日市上，益萌不忍輕易割愛之勢。據悉：該項花色，歷年銷往土耳其爲數亦頗可觀，茲據連日報載，彼地需茶股切，且吾當局業巳轉知全國商聯會，具報價格與數量，故頻將此間茶價帶俏，態度迭趨俏硬。至於向銷北菲之珍眉等綠茶，亦因持貨者居奇，供應不多，但輸出商畏高，依然猶豫，致市程續以進出兩稀，交易不多，形勢缺乏變遷。餘如內銷茶，本街與鄕帮各有添納，市氣穩秀若昔。</p>
<h3>棉紗市氣虛怯　各檔大都步跌一成左右</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因連日猛漲，新高峯疊現，人心不免虛怯，塲內更有不利買進流言，又有紡建公司續開二十支雙地球等五種，市上籌碼轉充，是以四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即微降一億一，中途以聞股市上揚，貨主扳價，回高至二十一億五千萬元，週一出貨亦高至廿二億二千萬。</p>
<p>嗣以月底關係，業中銀根趨緊，亟需頭寸者，乘高出籠，散多亦跟踪吐售，終以二十億零五千萬結束，比上日回降一億一千萬元。週一出貨二十一億，亦降一億元。廿一支雙馬紗，因開後出多求寡，軋小一億三千萬。全日趨勢，除十支得利童子軍等粗紗堅穩外，其餘各支粗細紗，大都回軟一成左右，成交亦少，祗有五十四件。</p>
<p>棉布堅穩</p>
<p>昨日棉布市況，晨開時以當局安定經濟，將有新措施發表，並着重管制物價等消息，人心咸具虛怯，新買少而賣戶反見多。十二磅龍頭細布，低價開後，因布商及散戶浮空抵補，復有下週一起廿五萬關金正式發行傳說，市塲人心驟見堅挺，霎時市盤狂升至五千九百十萬元有成交。</p>
<p>迨近午收時，紡建公司懸牌配售龍頭細布，且中檔五福及喇叭童細布，與龍頭做價拔開過多，達七八百萬元之鉅，引起一般出龍頭而進五福喇叭童之套買。更以銀根趨緊，散戶斬售，最後龍頭細布仍回小至五千七百萬結束，與上日軋平，較塲外價軋跌二百萬元，喇叭童中檔貨因套買多，價則步秀五十萬元。</p>
<p>此外四君子等元嗶嘰，因川帮搜購，再升五十萬元。金蓮妙舞軋好六百萬元，其餘漂布士林布藍布元布納夫妥等，亦各再挺一二百萬至一千五百萬不等，全日成交一千八百疋。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司配售之龍頭細布，自塡價聞爲五千七八百萬元，並悉每戶祗准購一件，人心吿挺。最後喊加價二三百萬買進，成交不惡，四君子嗶嘰相彷。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡昨循例拋售棉紗十餘種，核配准購單四六二條，售出棉布二〇九九〇疋，被單一三〇條。又紡建公司昨代紗管會，於棉紗市塲出售紗三種，共九五四件，價値七·八九九·〇〇〇萬元。</p>
<h3>統購棉花證　今起均廢止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會爲統購之棉花採購證運輸證，及上海市棉花移動證，定自今（八月一日）日起，一律廢止，並公吿全國週知云。</p>
<h3>美棉易紗比率　尙未具體計算</h3>
<p>本市各民營廠方面，以報載美援棉花易紗比率，有主張以五七七磅棉花易紗一件（包括工繳在內）一節，紛往六區公會詢問是否確實。據該公會負責人談，此項以紗易花比率，應依出口紗布之國際市價比照國外棉花價格，（運費關稅及其他費用包括在內，）方能計算交換棉花數量標準，至事實上究能掉換若干磅棉花，該技術小組並未具體計算云。</p>
<h3>人絲配價決定</h3>

<p>蚌埠　〔本報蚌埠卅一日電〕糧市仍在波動，小麥漲至四千二百萬，黃豆高盤五千四百萬，長米跌至四千二百萬，食油暴漲。</p>
<h3>銀錢業將與各業　商改進收解辦法</h3>
<p>各業票據向銀錢業爲收解者，限於上午，以致執有銀行錢莊本票者逾午即不得列入交換，勢非次日抵用不可，缺單之家，有頭寸而無從交換抵用，須另行收羅現鈔抵補，情勢甚爲困難。向所通行之轉帳申請書，各業所據以調撥下午頭寸者，又會奉命禁止，謂此項申請書銀錢業限於自用，不得應客戶之需要而開發，以致月餘以來，各業感於資金週轉之過份受扼，咸認爲非請銀錢業設法補救不可。棉布染織兩公會爰於句日前臚陳理由，列舉補救辦法，（一）收票時間延長兩小時，（二）增加本票交換一次，（三）開放轉帳申請書。商同工商各業同業公會七十餘單位聯名函請市商會轉商銀行公會及錢業公會，茲市商會已得銀錢業兩公會覆函，定於八月二日下午四時在商會邀集各業面商辦法，據銀錢業向商會表示，轉帳申請書之限制，事實上巳稍見放寬。至於收票之延長及本票之增加交換一次，實係人手及經費所限，並非不諒各業之困難云</p>

<p>今日倫敦陰翳四佈，驕陽退隱，數日來逼人熟浪，業已怯除，參加比賽選手共廿七人，槍聲響處，芬蘭之海諾一馬當先，其後爲瑞典之亞勃遜與屈恩伯特之雷姆喬恩。第三圈，海諾與亞勃遜依然前領，海斯屈姆（芬）·柯賈（法）先後超出雷姆喬恩，追隨於後。柴托貝克混於殿後之十餘人中，未顯顏色。第七圈，此不露聲色之捷克靑年漸露頭角，尚在前領之北歐將士，已開始感受威脅。第九圈，柴托貝克突如流星飛渡，先後越過史托坎（挪）·柯賈·亞勃遜·海斯　媽·以及海諾，自此即絕塵而馳，直抵終點。海諾於被超出三十公尺後，自知難再與抗衡，竟中途退出，而柴亦因競爭乏人，未能擊破海諾於一九三七年創造廿九分卅五秒四之世界紀錄。柴到達終點時，與第二之柯賈相距約在三百公尺。瑞典之亞勃遜與丹諾夫分膺三·四名，挪威之史托坎第五，比利時之愛佛勒第六。</p>

<h3>我籃球隊出師不利　第一戰敗於智利　四四比三九相差五分　罰球多不中坐失良機</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十一日廣播：中國籃球隊今日出師不利，初戰智利，即以五分之差敗下陣來，過程異常緊張，上半時，十九對十八，智利僅勝一分，下半時戰况更爲猛烈，智利隊員動作過火，中國獲得罰球機會甚多，但以心理過於緊張，每罰不中，以致坐失良機，觀衆均爲之惋惜，其中包松圓罰球六次未中，蔡忠强三次未命中，吳成章二次未中，于瑞章亦有三次未中，在此總共十四次中，苟有一半罰中，則亦可使中國隊獲勝矣。在此賽中，以蔡文華·吳成章最爲出色，蔡共獲十五分，吳亦獲九分，其餘諸子均失常態。此次世運籃球賽係採取循環賽，中國隊若在以後數次中護勝，仍有名列前茅之望</p>
<p>失敗原因</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦卅一日電〕我出席世運會籃球代表隊於首次比賽中，以四十四對三十九苦戰敗於智利隊。我代表隊於今晚四十分鐘之比賽中，未在順峯狀態。比賽顯示該隊缺乏顯著之獲分者，僅蔡文華之遠射及包松圓之急竄，隻手投籃，獲分較多。上半時二十分鐘，呈拉鋸狀態。雙方皆不能完全占得優勢，我代表隊錯失罰球良機多次，球運亦極不佳，因該隊隊員於多次極有把握之投射中，竟亦未能中籃獲分。我代表隊身高六英尺三英寸之後衛黃天錫，於犯規四次被罰離塲後，代表隊守勢乃大爲削弱。上半時結果，十八比十九智利占先。下半時開始，智利立增六分，首次顯然佔先，我代表隊隊長蔡文華於中塲連中二籃，使該隊又趨活躍。其他得分，則由包松圓及吳成章罰球獲進。包松圓後亦因犯規四次被罰出塲。代表隊失利之主因爲：（一）罰球未能獲分，（二）缺乏射籃人員，（三）二正式後衛被罰出塲後，守衛削弱。又我代表隊第二次比賽，對比利時隊。</p>
<h3>李世僑未趕到　情緒慌張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：中國籃球隊之敗於智利，前鋒得分之鑰李世僑未能趕到，實爲致命主因，而後衛之太輕於遠出，球入敵手，即無法回師搶救，亦係促成受挫之由。兩隊實力，在伯仲之間，故戰來極爲緊張。終塲前數分鐘，相差仍在半球至一球間，中國隊求勝心切，數罰未中，遂反爲智利連得兩球，回天乏術。開賽時中國之陣容爲：于瑞章，吳成章，蔡文華，包松圓，黃天錫。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦卅日電〕中國世運籃球隊卅日與智利交鋒，中國隊力戰下，以四十四比三十九敗北。得分表如下：</p>
<p>中國隊　擲中　罰中　犯規　得分</p>

<h3>所謂「科學」</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>楊妹的「謎」揭穿了，我國的科學家研究了這麽多天，花了若干金錢，總算證明了一個道理：</p>
<p>「不吃飯不能生活，九年不吃飯，不可能！」</p>
<p>我也不敢說這種給論算不算諷刺，只覺得中國的科學家何以這樣沒有信心！世界已竟到二十世紀的五十年代，還想把五行志的出典附會上科學根據，莫非這就是我們　　科學五十年的成就嗎？我眞替一賽先生一難爲情。</p>
<p>科學自有科學的眞理，不容許任何偶發的事項來　曲他，否則還算什麽眞理呢？人體需要營養，營養分得從食品裏吸收，連草木全不例外，這乃是常識了，算不得什麽科學上的發明和發現，我們的先民說過多少回：」一日不食則餓，三日不食則病，七日不食則死」，除了像某種政治性的絕食，可以有二十幾天不食的「奇蹟」以外，大約很少例外。然而我們的科學家却　這麽一點基本信念都沒有，豈不是怪事？</p>
<p>讀西洋史有哥伯尼加利略爲眞理而犧牲生命自由的故事，在中國人的頭腦中也許以爲太傻氣，至敢冒大下大不韙的達爾文，直至二十世紀三十年代，美國還有因進化論而起訴的事，達氏在當時所受的宗敎迫害，恐非我輩所能想象。池們所以肯於如是堅定，不爲世俗的謬誤所移，無非爲了信道篤，認識眞，其本質與宗敎家的殉敎精神，並無二致。所惜沒有一個人寫出一本書，把爲眞理信念而犧牲的先哲，加以描繪，可以使我們多一點勇氣；不過，就是看看居禮夫人傳這種影片，不也足以使懦夫有立志嗎？</p>
<p>中國是科學不發達的國家，儘管有些國粹學者大唱其墨子發明飛機，詩經有八大行星諸怪論，給全世界的科學原理在中國找到祖宗，究竟事實與之相去太遠，只能作爲民族衰老的一堂吉訶德一精神寄託。可是我們昔賢對於認識真理的勇氣，却常常賜予我們鼓勵。孟子所說：自反而縮，雖千萬人吾往矣。　又說：　富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈。　都是極好的敎訓，只是我們偏車倫理規律，西洋偏　自然規律，於是發展成爲哲學枓學兩個型範而已</p>
<p>有人說，因爲沒有科學系統，哲學也是零碎的，不能像亞里士多德康德那麽組成一個體系，這話也不錯，主要還是我們太顧及人生日用，不大肯空想之故；此亦氣候·地理·經濟狀况所造成，無可如何者也。）孔子所講的忠恕一貫，章太炎先生即解作爲學方法，忠是忠實於眞理和知識，恕是由眞理推想，所謂以一隅反三隅，有若今日物理幾何等科中的定義定理。或者這話有些偏，然而看了淸代漢學家的治學精神，我們覺得是不錯的。</p>
<p>野蠻民族的多神教與巫術，又稱爲薩滿敎，今西伯利亞土人及中國東北邊區少數民族尚保留此風，而且一直蔓延到黃河流域，　人跳神，蛇，　，狐，鼠，全是崇拜的對象，大仙一的小廟遍布各處。與此相應合的，是較爲知識份子所信仰的扶乩。雖然科學進步了，大都市有輪奐堂皇的醫院，大學裏開辦了若干自然科學應用科學的院系，而在民問仍舊是走方郎中與巫覡的天下，大都市中也充滿科學命相之類，這簡直是我們的恥辱。像楊妹一類的事，其初期動機想來不會與女巫的跳神有什麼差異，不料因爲愚民的信仰而使科學界垂靑，費了若干金錢與時間研究一個絕對不與科學相符合的現象，至少我以爲這是一種浪費！現在是到底有了破綻，證明了人不吃飯不會生存，假使這破綻永遠不被發現，難道科學界眞的準備承認「不吃飯照樣可以活下去」這條原理嗎？科學證明了不科學的謠言，　滿敎使全部有了根據，我不敢揣想民衆對於賽先生將取什麽　的態度！</p>
<p>不但科學的物質建設需要再努力，科學的精神建設更要努力！請不要再被烏煙瘴氣迷了眼睛，則幸甚矣！</p>
<h3>外國麒麟</h3>
<p>— 南無</p>
<p>歐洲在十六世紀時，仇人間下毒之風大盛。一時豪門大族，莫不爭先恐後的去買麟角杯，　因爲他們相信麒麟的角有解毒的功效。但麒麟本來不過是傳說中的東西，所以他們所買到的事實上都是象牙製的杯子而已　一五五三年時，法國皇帝亨利第二曾出巨價購買一麟角杯　一隻，這筆價錢照現在算起來，要値到十萬美元之多。按西洋傳說中的麒麟體形如馬，頭似山羊，有　，額中有一只斜伸向前的角，這只角極長，有達四五尺者。又十三四世紀壁晝中的麒麟大多是白顏色的，狀甚溫馴，但也有畫着牠正在用那只長角刺人的圖書。</p>
<h3>陳少白的詞章</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>革命元勛陳少白，少年時居鄉習舉子業，聰穎能文（見鍾榮光的陳少白先生傳）。豐姿俊美，才思敏捷，詩詞歌賦，琴碁書畫無所不通，有風琉才子之號，興中會初期缺少文十，文吿多出少白手。（見馮自由的陳少白之詞章）陳氏的主辦中國日報，言論警闢，獨冠一時，民國前九年，保皇黨在香港出版商報，由康有爲的學生徐勤任社長，陳與徐筆戰十數續稿，爲內地政治論戰的開始。</p>
<p>兩廣總督陶模嚮慕新學，每日必看中國日報，常常根據中國日報的評論，做黜陟　吏的標準。光緒末年，兩廣總督岑春煊宣佈把粵漢鐵路收歸官辦，粵路股東，一致反抗。岑逮捕紳耆　國廉下　，掀起路政風潮。在香港的股東，組織一粵路股東維護路權會　，向淸廷力抗。此會所發布的文字和一切計劃，即由陳所主持。港紳平日欽佩陳的文章深刻流暢，故特聘爲顧問。</p>
<p>民國十八年，國父奉安南京，他到南京參加。事先住在上海東亞旅社，我們常有機緣談天。有一天，他把做好的挽國父聯句，寫給我看，聯云：一失敗云乎哉！行道期百年，　棄小就，力赴大同，雖在顚沛中，彌留中，未嘗少懈。流風今已矣！入世垂卅載，驅策羣雄，招徠多十，爲問眞知己，眞同調，究属阿誰？「上款是一逸仙兄千古」，下款是「陳少白拜輓」。陳與國父是香港西醫書院的同學，兩人曾經義結金蘭，拜盟爲兄弟，國父和同志中稱兄弟的只有陳一人而已，故陳也直稱國父爲兄。（事實上，國父比陳大三歲。）</p>
<p>陳生平服應他的鄕先輩陳白沙（獻章），故易名白，字少白（他原名聞韶，號　石），曾題故鄉新會南門的對句：一嶺南理學無雙士，封內山川第一城。一也可以見到景行維賢的心志，不僅是聯語做得貼切。</p>
<p>的文章，文字太長，不便選錄。今摘錄他的詩數首，鼎嘗一　，以例其餘。咸陽訪素政　詩：一、「華淸小住恰春三，無盡幽奇任意探。欲識英雄長臥處，驪山山北渭河南。」二、「百仞孤墳負土成，六王消散罷紛爭。東南今竟無門戶，應憶籌邊萬里城。」贈東方大俠宮崎寅藏琵琶題詞：一流落潯陽婦，冰絃訴別情。吳門乞食客，亦作洞簫聲。英雄漂泊紅顏老，同抱餘情委秋草。贈爾琵琶作伴遊，一撥十年長潦倒。」遊張家口感賦：「長城起迄兩無端，拔地參天　也難。塞外風沙天欲變，秋初脊雨夢生寒。日中爲市非胡馬，客裏逢人盡漢冠。兩堡太平三百載，但敎相保勿相殘。</p>
<h3>匈加利談屑</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>加利是中歡洲的一個古國，至今還保持過去的許多習俗。例如一個未婚少女携了一桶早餐送給田中工作的農夫吃時，連帶還送給他一盆鮮花和水菓，如果他樂予接受，將一包糖送還她，即視爲正式訂婚。匈加利女人的芳名，十人中有九人喚做伊隆娜。她們在政治上可以享受投票權，但以年在三十歲以上，至少生有十女三人，曾受大學敎育，有謀生能力，或嫁於曾受高中敎育的丈夫者爲限</p>
<p>匃加利人嗜吃咖哪粉，每餐必備。農夫們的皮夾中，隨身携有大量粉末。他們吃玉蜀黍時，連穗鬚一併吃下，歐洲人往往以此爲笑柄。境內的伯拉頓湖，爲中歐最大的淡水湖，特產靑峭魚一種，製成魚肉羹，美味可口。</p>
<p>匃加利京城爲布達佩斯德，其實係田布達城及佩斯德城合成，中由多腦河分劃兩區，上有橋樑，貫通其問。布達城年代較久，佩斯德城較具現代色彩。該處爲駕舟出游勝地，水上賽船，也很有名。</p>
<p>加利種族很複　，有瑪格耶人，日耳曼人，猶太人，塞爾伯人，鮑斯尼人，斯洛伐克人等，內以瑪格耶人，聲勢最盛，佔全人口總數中百分之九十三，對於其他種族，往往加以歧視。</p>
<h3>登臨</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>以土石築，上建樓閣，得遠眺之樂。元結　臺銘序云，一古人有蓄憤悶與病於時俗者，力不能築高臺以瞻眺，則必山巔海畔，伸頸歌吟，以自暢達。一此所謂臺，實一嚴石，高八九十尺耳。其銘曰，「湘淵淸深，峿臺峭峻，登臨長望，無遠不盡，誰厭朝市，覇牽局促，借君此臺，壹縱心目。」讀此始知登臨爲用之妙，街頭混迹，自忘其局促久矣。現代有摩天樓，其頂可登，下視人如蟲蟻，然外國有於此下投自殺者。使彼輩能味元結此言，聊自暢達，何不可以高瞻遠矚易其厭世之念耶。或謂登高者仰視蒼穹，俯瞰塵濁，將愈增其憤悶厭惡之情。是誠有之，未見道者如是耳。若莊嚴地獄，腦髓可施，正願化身千億，爲帥爲炬，負荷羣生，爲之重擔，何用登臨以自遣乎。</p>
<h3>黃賓虹贈高吹萬聯</h3>
<p>國書祭酒黃賓虹先生，高壽八十有五矣，近歲旅居北平，書書之外，著述不　。最近由平飛滬，滬上諸書家特在大觀社集會歡迎，盛極一時。右爲賓老賀金山高吹萬先生去歲七十大慶之壽聯。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>上海大拆翁仲之活劇，及愚民起鬨之情景，可稱如火如茶。觀銅版上翁仲被拉被舉之狀，其狼狽而滑稽，倍於一打皂分家一劇中之皂王。舊都之翁仲甚多，而風氣之開通又遲於江南，然却未見過如此熟鬧。</p>
<p>售都之翁仲在四郊者，因王公貴　大臣之墓地，例得樹立，其多少視位號之高下爲等差。（俗呼　石人石馬，石人有文武兩　，石馬包括各式之　。）其在城市常見者爲古玩舖　貨　。石人之　多不完整，或半截之體，成一個人頭，與木偶，泥塑者，同爲鑑古性質。石馬·石麟·獅·象·多爲小型，陳列舖門側階上，以其　　，無被竊之虞，而又爲絕　之廣吿品，行人路過，　使　足觀　，則舖內一切古色古香，由此爲介，而印象普　。對外人尤富吸引力，從前「洋莊」銷路極暢。而民國以來，旗下貴族窮困日增，此等物原無實用，求售者多，然眞者多大型，搬運出售皆非易易，小者又不可多得，而可以仿造。有些善發洋財者，命石匠仿其形而縮小其體積，猶模型之類。</p>
<p>昔年東交民巷洋人多，洋莊盛，時因外人極喜搜羅佛像神像及法器用具，而舊京原是遼金元各代之都會，寺院之多，比「南朝四百八十寺」有過之無不及，九城內外有名可指者三百七十餘座，而街頭巷尾之小庵小廟，則不可勝數。因時代變遷，香火寥落，除特別著名之大剎外，其中偶像供具，大多由住持與商人相勾結，經由古物商而轉入洋人手小型寺院之屋則出賃民戶成爲雜院，殿宇所有，十存二三，略支門面，餘則不翼而飛矣。小　之偶像及佛器，旣便陳設及運載，且製作有極精妙者（以型小易於施工），實爲至高之美術。國人除信仰者請去家庭供奉外，每慮褻凟，不肯輕易購置，洋人則無所不收。故各古物商店之後院屋中，大小神佛像具，式式供備，恍如置身古廟中，此係民國二十年以前之情形。近十餘年洋人少，洋莊「萎」，寺刷之存貨亦愈缺，古物商歇業十之七八，一切成爲過眼烟雲。日前偶游廟會，見一老和尚擺攤，將破舊袈裟，及殘缺經典·木魚·念珠等，傾筐倒篋以出之，爲易取旦夕溫鮑之資，則又返映一般的生活日趨窘迫，寺院尤甚。今之喪家，很少有力做佛事，而僧衆又向以「應酬」（即出應經懺之謂）爲收入之大宗　且新式經濟殯葬盛行，問津者少。回想前淸時代「在京的和尚，出外的官」，儼然隔世矣。從前京官多淸寒，且無儀仗，而外官現任多尊榮闊綽，惟北京各大寺僧，多與內廷貴爵顯宦名士往來，宴會酬酢，活動力甚大，廟產及收人茂暢豐盈，尋常佛事，轉爲次義，故時人以為做官宜於外，做和尙宜於京也。</p>
<p>淪陷期中，日　搜囤實物，供其軍需，大米一項，幾乎成爲日人與少數高級僞官專享品，其他糧食莫不價昂物缺，各大寺僧侶極衆，眞是「粥少僧多」，　　不繼，於是西城某大名剎實行「托缽」大游行，滿街和尚成隊，中國人詫爲從未經見。但在印細一帶，則事所常有。所謂「沿門托缽」，經臨民戶每敬獻　粥，中國非純佛敎國，故雖「托缽」，郤未便「沿門」，只是一種　荒之表示耳。</p>

        <h1>1948.08.01</h1>
<h3>President and Wife Return to Capital; Summon Chiefs Before Leaving Shanghai for Discussion; Instructed to Maintain Social Order and Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 31st] The President and his wife flew back to Nanjing from Shanghai at 10:45 PM on the 31st and went straight to their official residence to rest.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the President spent the entire day studying the general price and economic situation in this city. He separately met with Shanghai's military and political chiefs, representatives from people's organizations, and financial executives, inquiring about the city's prices, finances, wounded soldiers, refugees, and special relief donations. He expressed particular concern for prices and public order. He instructed Governor Yu of the National Bank in person to strictly crack down on speculation and hoarding, and to take effective financial measures to stabilize prices. He also instructed Police Chief Yu Shuping to strengthen warehouse inspections and pay attention to the livelihood of the police. After completing his official duties, the President and his wife returned to Nanjing by special plane at 9:30 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>The President rose early yesterday morning, around 7:00 AM, and received Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM, followed by Speaker Pan. He inquired about various matters, with each discussion lasting twenty minutes. The President expressed deep concern for General Chen Cheng's health and sent Director Yu Jishi to visit him on his behalf in the morning. Later, upon learning that Chen's recovery was not as rapid as expected, he personally wrote a letter and sent someone to offer his condolences in the afternoon. The President took a short rest in the afternoon. He spent time with relatives from 4:00 PM onward. Kong Lingkan was summoned for an audience, which lasted about forty minutes. Yu Hongjun also arrived at the official residence around 6:00 PM to pay his respects, departing at 6:45 PM. According to Yu, the President was particularly concerned about the price situation in the city and personally instructed that hoarding and speculation be strictly prohibited to stabilize general prices. However, today's discussions were limited to the price issue in this city and were separate from the matters discussed in the meeting at Mogan Mountain. At 7:00 PM, the President and his wife drove along Haige Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and the Bund area of Nanjing Road to inspect the city's appearance and then went to the Shanghai International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road to lay flowers at Madam Soong's tomb.</p>
<p>Properly Arrange for Refugees and Wounded Soldiers; Strive to Solicit Special Relief Donations</p>
<p>At 8:30 PM, the President summoned Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun, Mayor Wu Guozhen, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, City Party Chief Fang Zhi, and Police Chief Yu Shuping for a meeting. He inquired in detail about the situation of the Party, government, military, and people in Shanghai and mentioned matters such as prices, refugees, wounded soldiers, and special relief donations. Mayor Wu and others gave concise reports and described recent handling measures. The President instructed that efforts must be made to stabilize prices. With the new rice about to enter the market, rice prices should be particularly monitored to prevent soaring. The refugee and wounded soldier issues must be discussed with the relevant central authorities as soon as possible to properly arrange for their resettlement, preferably through relocation for farming. From the city's conscription quota, 6,000 men can be allocated for assignment to the Songhu Garrison Brigade to strengthen local public security. There are also proper plans for new recruit barracks, which should be discussed and decided by the city government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of National Defense. Regarding the city's special relief donation quota of 85 trillion, it is considered that this amount has already been greatly reduced based on current prices, and efforts should be made to solicit donations to exceed the original quota, so as to serve as a national model. Mayor Wu and others replied that they had scheduled a meeting within days to actively promote the donation work to meet the expectations of the central government. The meeting ended at 9:10 PM, after which the President and his entourage hurriedly went to Longhua Airport. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Commander Xuan all went to see them off. Security at the airport was tight. The President and his wife, along with their entourage, boarded a four-engine special plane at 9:30 PM to return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>New Economic and Financial Policy Plan Is a Prelude to Currency Reform; Possible Announcement and Implementation on the 5th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 31st] The new economic and financial policy plan decided upon at Mogan Mountain may be announced and implemented on August 5th. Rumors that it would be announced and implemented from the 1st have not yet been confirmed by authoritative sources as of the 31st. When Finance Minister Wang Yunwu and Deputy Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan were surrounded by reporters after attending the political affairs meeting on the 31st, both strongly stated that no plan would be announced on the 1st. It is understood that although this plan has been discussed and decided by the President together with Premier Weng, Finance Minister Wang, and Governor Yu, it still needs to be approved by the political affairs meeting, so the announcement date will likely be delayed until around the 5th. As for the content of the plan, authoritative sources have confirmed that it is not an immediate currency reform, but it can be regarded as preparation work for currency reform. This plan includes a comprehensive set of economic and financial measures, and the economic reform process is also the beginning of economic reform. After the implementation of this plan, based on actual needs and objective conditions, another complete set of measures will be gradually implemented until the economy tends to be completely stable and the currency reform is successfully completed. This plan takes financial policy and foreign exchange policy as two major pillars, including the control of the market, the regulation of financial institutions, and the inspection of banks and warehouses, etc. However, this is a peaceful and legal economic policy, not aimed at individuals, and will not adopt confiscation measures, and will never use drastic means. It is believed that this policy will not affect the lives of many people and will have a good impact on the international community. The difference between this plan and the past economic reform plans and economic measures is that this time, a focus approach is adopted, rather than simply focusing on the articles as in the past. At the same time, there is more careful and thorough consideration in advance. According to the financial policy of this plan, in the future, there will be the most thorough management of speculative capital, so that it cannot cause trouble. Illegal lending by banks will be restricted as much as possible, and currency will be suppressed to circulate in the market, so as to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices and stabilizing finance. When the economy is stable and the international and domestic balance of payments are balanced, the currency system will be formally reformed. These measures and plans are the prelude to currency reform.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun was summoned to Mogan Mountain to meet with the President and has returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. According to Yu, his mission was to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the economy. Since the national budget was passed by the Legislative Yuan, its execution is extremely important, and it is related to finance and economy. How to balance income and expenditure, verify expenditures, increase foreign exchange, improve remittances from overseas Chinese, enrich tax revenue, and how to strengthen financial control and crack down on hoarding and speculation are all topics for discussion. In addition, how various central ministries and commissions should connect, and how the central government and local governments should cooperate, are also comprehensively reviewed. The President has given detailed instructions on the shortcomings of past measures and the future improvement directions. Yu also mentioned that the use of US aid will help improve our economy, but everything should still be based on self-help. The above-mentioned points are all ways to cooperate with US aid to strive for self-help. As for the principles of application, while one side should abide by bilateral agreements, the other side should seek to achieve the goal of stabilizing the economy. All these economic issues have been specifically addressed during this meeting. After the approval of the Executive Yuan, it can be implemented. Finally, Yu said in an optimistic tone: It is expected that exports will increase, and remittances from overseas Chinese are gradually improving. The measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic residents to invest in domestic production enterprises have been announced and implemented, and domestic production enterprises will have new development. In addition, the second batch of US aid materials can arrive one after another. In the future, the economic situation will definitely tend to stabilize.</p>

<h3>President to Host Reception for Guests Today; Commemorating the Restoration of the Official Residence After Several Destructions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 31st] President Chiang will host a reception at the new official residence next to the Lingyuan Avenue at 11:00 AM on August 1st to entertain senior government officials and diplomatic envoys stationed in Nanjing, commemorating the restoration of this building after several destructions. The new official residence is located on a small hill on the south side of Lingyuan Avenue, approximately midway between Zhongshan Gate and Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. It is surrounded by lush trees, with pines and cypresses reaching into the clouds. From a distance, only faint green tiles and red walls can be seen, and it is only upon closer inspection that the superior environment of the garden is discovered, which is extremely quiet and secluded. The entrance to the new official residence is full of rural charm. A gravel road leads from the roadside forest to a small, through-style house inhabited by a concierge. Through this, a slow slope and stone steps lead to the northwest corner in front of the main house of the official residence. Vehicles also have a circular road around to the portico in front of the main house. The main house is named "Christ's Triumphant Song Hall", and the lintel is personally inscribed by the President in gold characters on a vermilion background in November 1947, which is full of ancient charm. Entering the door is a reception room, and behind it is a sky hall. Outside the hall is a veranda. The entire building is a three-story palace-style building, covered with flying eaves, painted rafters, carved railings, and glazed blue tiles. The vermilion giant pillars are high and majestic, which is extremely beautiful to behold. The scenery on the veranda is especially good. Leaning on the white stone railing engraved with phoenixes, facing the embroidered green fields, the Veterans' School is on the right, and the National Chengchi University is on the left, where the sound of music can be heard. In front is an endless expanse of fields, and the gentle breeze blows the rice, with thousands of heads bowing. Looking south, Maoshan seems to be in a painting. Between morning and evening, it is like a touch of light indigo, blending into the clouds, which makes people think a lot about the mountains and rivers. It is said that this new official residence was built by Yang Xiaotian before the war and offered to the former National Government. Only the late Chairman Lin once lived there as an official residence. When the capital was moved west, it was abandoned. During the enemy's occupation, it was once stationed by the Japanese army. After the victory, it was once occupied by bandits. After nine years of looting, it was severely damaged. When the National Government returned to the capital, the Military Affairs Bureau of the Office of the Military Counselor hired workers to carry out repairs, which took two and a half years to restore its original appearance, and it was re-honored as the President's new residence.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On the Budget for the Second Half of the Year – Also Discussing Financial and Monetary Reform Policies –</h3>
<p>The draft budget for the second half of this year has been submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for review and discussion, and is undergoing final approval. According to the Ministry of Finance, the total estimated amount of the budget is approximately 10 trillion 法幣, with tax revenue estimated at 5 trillion 法幣 and a deficit of approximately 5 trillion 法幣. In the extraordinary financial situation of suppressing the rebellion, being able to maintain a 50/50 ratio between debt and revenue is already a remarkable phenomenon. Moreover, after the Legislative Yuan increases revenue and reduces expenditures, the deficit will naturally be even smaller. However, these are estimated figures for the budget, not the actual amounts received and spent by the national treasury, let alone the final accounting figures. Therefore, whether it can maintain the 50/50 ratio between tax and debt naturally remains a question.</p>
<p>We will first examine the total amount of the national budget for this half-year. Is it sufficient based on the recent trend of rising prices? Recent prices are approximately 4 million times higher than in the first half of 1937 before the war. If this total budget amount is converted to 法幣 based on the price index before the war, it is actually worth only 250 million 法幣 before the war. Furthermore, if it is converted based on today's black market exchange rate for the US dollar, it is worth only US$125 million. According to the Ministry of Finance's report, the national treasury's actual expenditures were 1.336 billion 法幣 in 1935 and 1.893 billion 法幣 in 1936. Although there was also internal unrest at that time, the area of suppression was not as large as it is today. Expenditures already required 1.3 billion to 1.8 billion 法幣. Therefore, a budget for the second half of this year that is worth only 250 million 法幣 before the war will, in reality, be difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will look at the deficit of 5 trillion 法幣 for the second half of this year. If this 5 trillion 法幣 is converted to US dollars at the black market exchange rate, it is worth only US$62.5 million. If tax revenues for this year can be fully remitted to the national treasury, then there should be no need to seek assistance from the Central Bank's Issuing Bureau to cover this deficit. This is because even one-sixth of the total amount of the US aid loan to China would be sufficient to cover it. According to a telegram dated July 11, the United States Aid to China Administration announced that the allocations to China in the third quarter would reach US$60 million to US$70 million. Therefore, the amount of US allocations in the third quarter alone would be sufficient to cover our half-year budget deficit.</p>
<p>However, if we estimate from the perspective of financial resources, the original target for tax revenue in the budget for the second half of this year was 5 trillion 法幣, and US aid was US$400 million. According to the agreement, economic aid accounts for US$275 million and special aid accounts for US$125 million. It is scheduled to be fully allocated from April of this year to April of next year. Let us assume that US$250 million of this amount can be used in this year, which, when converted to 法幣, would be 20 trillion 法幣. In addition, according to a telegram from Nanjing on the 11th, in order to increase the national treasury's revenue in the second half of the year, the Ministry of Finance plans to sell surplus US goods and lend-lease materials worth approximately 157 trillion 法幣, sell enemy and puppet property and materials worth approximately 10 trillion 法幣, and sell Japanese reparations materials worth over 3.7 trillion 法幣. If we only estimate the above-mentioned financial resources, the national treasury's income for the second half of this year could reach 28.7 trillion 法幣. At the same time, due to the ad valorem collection of commodity taxes, revenue may double due to rising prices. In addition, there are state-owned enterprises valued at approximately US$400 million that have been allocated to the Central Bank as reserves for 法幣. If mobilized as wartime financial resources, they would be worth 32 trillion 法幣. Therefore, according to my estimation, if the budget for the second half of this year is compiled based on income, it could reach approximately 70 trillion 法幣, and there would be no need to issue public bonds, let alone seek assistance from the Central Bank's Issuing Bureau.</p>
<p>I believe that if the government is determined and uses this policy of living within its means to maximize budget expenditures, it may be able to achieve the goals of inevitable victory in suppressing the rebellion and inevitable success in nation-building. Merely trying to quell the internal rebellion and complete nation-building with a budget equivalent to 250 million 法幣 before the war is akin to a hypnotic fantasy far removed from reality.</p>
<p>Recently, the Legislative Yuan has been making various cuts to this 10 trillion 法幣 budget, which is equivalent to 250 million 法幣 before the war, making it seem even more out of touch with reality. At the same time, I also feel that the Ministry of Finance's proposal of this 10 trillion 法幣 estimate is not in line with the current situation. I am not talented, but I would like to try to compile a draft budget estimate for the second half of this year based on the principle of living within our means, as follows:</p>
<p>Draft National Budget Estimate for the Second Half of 1948</p>
<p>Revenue Section</p>
<p>1. Tax Revenue (including administrative revenue, etc.): 10 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>2. Loan Revenue (US$250 million): 20 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>3. Revenue from State-Owned Assets</p>
<p>(1) Revenue from the Sale of Surplus US Goods and Lend-Lease Materials: 3 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>(2) Revenue from the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Property and Materials: 1 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>(3) Revenue from the Sale of Japanese Reparations Materials: 500 billion 法幣</p>
<p>(4) Revenue from the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises: 32 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>4. Revenue from State-Owned Business Profits: 10 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>Total Revenue: 76.5 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>Expenditure Section</p>
<p>1. Military Expenditure: 35 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>2. Economic Construction Expenditure: 25 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>3. Other Government Affairs Expenditure: 16.5 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>Total Expenditure: 76.5 trillion 法幣</p>
<p>Increasing military expenditure can strengthen combat capabilities and boost morale. Increasing economic construction can strengthen national defense, increase national wealth and national income, and also cultivate financial resources. Increasing other government affairs expenditure can raise the salaries of public servants and teachers, thereby enhancing administrative efficiency and maintaining cultural standards.</p>
<p>If the total budget expenditure of 76.5 trillion 法幣 is calculated based on the recent price index of 4 million times, it is approximately 1.9 billion 法幣 before the war. Now that the government has this amount of financial resources, it seems that it can be used to a greater extent, which would allow us to quell the Communist rebellion in one fell swoop. The period of suppressing the rebellion can be shortened, the economic crisis can be eliminated, and the proportion of national wealth and national income can be increased. If the suppression of the rebellion ends, the vast resources of Northeast and North China can be developed, and with the restoration of transportation in various places, the special products of various places can be exchanged with each other, thereby stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>Although China has experienced eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of internal strife, China still has the ability to help itself. Although the Chinese Communist Party occupies a portion of the resource-rich areas of Northeast and North China, they cannot engage in exploitation. Therefore, China's true national wealth is still in the hands of the Chinese state. In addition, the government has US financial assistance, as well as a large amount of enemy and puppet property and materials, Japanese reparations materials, and US surplus goods and lend-lease materials under its control. It also has large-scale state-owned business organizations. Therefore, the country is not truly poor. The reason for its poverty is that some government officials have shaken their confidence and have failed to make good use of its wealth. For example, three years have passed since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and the 逆産 from enemy and puppet property has still been suspended, with most of it not yet processed. Furthermore, a large amount of government materials are piled up in barren fields, exposed to the wind and rain, without being cherished or valued. Recently, Japanese reparations materials have been continuously shipped in, but we have not heard of the government bidding or selling them to the public. The proverb "starving to death while living next to a rice bin" truly describes the current government!</p>
<p>In recent years, the greatest negative impression the public has of the government's finances is the vast disparity between budget and national treasury revenue and expenditure figures. On the one hand, this is due to the continuous rise in prices, which has led to repeated supplementary budgets through emergency orders. On the other hand, it is due to the government's lack of long-term financial policies, resulting in the mere use of superficial measures to suppress the budget. It must be understood that in this extraordinary period, extraordinary policies must be used to meet extraordinary needs. In an extraordinary period, merely using methods that treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches, or even treating the head when the foot aches and the foot when the head aches, is naturally impractical. Due to the government's unsound financial and economic policies, it has lost the trust of the people. Take 法幣 as an example: the reason why prices are rising day by day is that people are unwilling to keep 法幣 in their hands, and it is even more impossible to deposit it in banks. As soon as they have 法幣, they immediately exchange it for goods, gold, foreign currency, or other items such as silver dollars. Precisely because everyone does this, the speed of 法幣 circulation in the market increases, and the amount of circulation also becomes rampant. If everyone trusts 法幣, everyone stores 法幣 in banks, and ordinary banks do not use deposits for hoarding, speculation, or purchasing gold and US dollars, then the bank can restore its original function of controlling the public's purchasing power, and the financial market will surely return to normal, prices will tend to stabilize, and the public's 法幣 purchasing power will remain stable. Therefore, the government's financial and economic policies today should make absolutely stopping the issuance of more 法幣 the primary goal. (Continued on page 5)</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Heyuan Dyke in Xiangyin Causes Over a Thousand Deaths; Flooding in Northern Hunan Recurrence After the Initial Disaster</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 31st] The river tide in Xiangyin rose sharply on the night of the 29th, causing the collapse of the Heyuan Dyke, encompassing over 40,000 acres.

<h3>The Entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is Connected; The Main Artery of Transportation in Southeastern China is Thus Completed; Engineering Trains Will Run Temporarily, and Official Operations Will Commence After Slight Adjustments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, from Hangzhou to Zhuzhou, was connected on the 31st. The road connects the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway to the east and the Guangdong-Hankou railway to the west. The total length of the main and branch lines, including the 南潯 railway, is 1,153 kilometers. The main railway network in southeastern China has thus been completed. The road was actually completed in the year of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, but the repair work was arduous due to subsequent Communist damage. It has now been completed due to the material issues. Currently, the newly built Nanping section, the last section to be connected, will temporarily run engineering materials trains. Official operations will begin after slight adjustments. From then on, it will be possible to travel from Nanjing to Hangzhou via this road to Zhuzhou, and then transfer to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Kowloon, a total distance of approximately 2,300 kilometers. It is also possible to connect with the Xiang-Gui Railway from Hengyang on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, travel 538 kilometers to Liuzhou, and then connect to the Qian-Gui Railway, travel 460 kilometers to Duyun in Guizhou. Therefore, starting from Nanjing, it is possible to reach the southeastern and southwestern provinces by relying on the railway alone. Land transportation south of the Yangtze River will be greatly facilitated. Agricultural, industrial, and mineral products from all along the road can also be transported and circulated more easily, which is of great benefit to the economy, politics, and culture.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 31st] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is 1,153 kilometers long and is a major transportation artery in the east-west direction. The entire track-laying project was completed at 10:00 AM on the 31st. The track was joined at Shangqiao, Yichun, in Nanchuntuo. According to Director Hou of the Railway Bureau, the two major bridges of Zhangshu and Yuanshui have not yet been completed. The steel beams for the former will be shipped from Canada in September and temporarily carried over. The steel beams for the latter have already been transported to Guangzhou and are awaiting shipment. Once this bridge is completed, the entire line can be opened to traffic.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau believes that Communist unrest has been increasing recently, making it difficult to protect important areas and bridges along the line with road police, so it has telegraphed the Quzhou绥署 to ensure traffic safety.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Repairs Completed and Traffic Resumes; Passenger and Freight Rates Adjusted Today</h3>

<h3>Investigation into the Truth of the July 5th Incident; Qin Dechun Flies to Beiping This Morning; The July 5th Investigation Committee Announces That the Investigation Has Yielded Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Vice Minister Qin Dechun, who was appointed to go to Beiping to investigate the July 5th Incident, is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the morning of the 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Regarding the aftermath of the July 5th incident involving students from Northeast China, Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan had previously sent telegrams to the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Garrison, Dong Wenqi, the Mayor of Fanyang, and Liu Yaozhang, the Mayor of Beiping, and instructed the Ministry of Education to provide guidance on how to handle the matter properly. It is now learned that, out of caution, the Executive Yuan has, in addition to sending Vice Minister Qin Dechun to Beiping to conduct an on-site investigation of the truth and coordinate the handling, changed the telegrams and sent them separately from Premier Weng to the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Garrison and the Commander-in-Chief of North China. The general idea is: The President is extremely concerned about the July 5th incident involving students from Northeast China and hopes for a proper resolution. In addition to the various measures that have been previously telegraphed, this Yuan has dispatched Vice Minister Qin Dechun to fly to Beiping immediately to investigate the situation on the ground and discuss handling everything.</p>
<p>According to relevant sources, the government has always been extremely concerned about students from Northeast China and has taken measures to improve their living conditions. In early June of this year, the Executive Yuan specially allocated 100 billion 法幣 in emergency funds for universities in Northeast China, which were handed over to the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters for unified management. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education was instructed to advance 61.5 billion 法幣 to Northeastern University in Beiping for the opening expenses of the temporary university and 26 billion 法幣 for student food expenses. Recently, an additional 20 billion 法幣 was allocated for the tuition center and 10 billion 法幣 for the Beiping Temporary High School. The government has allocated a total of over 220 billion 法幣 for students from Northeast China from May to the present, and all of these funds were allocated before the National Budget had been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan. Given the country's extremely difficult financial situation, it cannot be said that the government's concern for young people in Northeast China is not comprehensive.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Northeast compatriots in Beijing held a tea party at Jieshoutang at 3:00 PM on the 31st to discuss the July 5th incident and welcome Gu Fengxiang, the Northeast Supervisory Commissioner. Archbishop Yu Bin presided over the meeting. Commissioner Gu was invited to attend and report on the reaction of all sectors of Shenyang to the incident and his contact with relevant authorities after arriving in Beijing. The attendees believed that the President was particularly concerned about this matter, and that the Supervisory Yuan and Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan had sent senior officials to investigate the truth. The Central Government had taken wise measures, so they unanimously supported the three measures announced by Premier Weng, but hoped that they would be implemented quickly and seriously so that the incident could be resolved legally and reasonably.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st] The July 5th Incident Investigation Committee announced: The investigation work has yielded results and is currently drafting a report. It is reported that the work is progressing smoothly, and the investigation results are not far from what the Northeast people claimed. The so-called first shot is no longer the main issue; the main issue is the death of students. Zhang Baozi and others from the Shenyang Senate, representatives of the people of Northeast China, are still in Beiping. Chuan 日電蒋总统请速处理此问题.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The central government attaches importance to the July 5th incident. Premier Weng telegraphed Gao Xibing, the Deputy Chairman of the Political Committee, and others on the 30th, expressing his determination to take responsibility for properly handling and resolving the matter fairly to avoid escalating the situation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The Northeast Political Committee convened a meeting of the leaders of various provinces and cities and the members of the July 5th Northeast People's Support Association at 10:00 AM on the 31st to discuss the August 1st protest rally and demonstration by the people of Shenyang against the July 5th tragedy. The leaders expressed that they should wait for the central government's reply and postpone taking action. The representatives of the Support Association believed that it was necessary to express their attitude, so the protest rally and demonstration on the 1st will be held.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Disregards the Interests of Other Countries and Establishes a Japanese Trade Policy; Wu Bannong Straightforwardly Criticizes It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] Shi Huanke, the recently arrived US Vice Consul in Shanghai, visited Wu Bannong, the head of the Economic Group of the Chinese delegation and Chairman of the Compensation and Restitution Commission, today to discuss Sino-Japanese trade issues. It is reported that during the meeting, Wu directly criticized the Allied Headquarters for disregarding the interests of other Far Eastern countries and establishing a Japanese trade policy, which he said was a shortsighted action. Wu pointed out that the biggest obstacle to Sino-Japanese trade was the Allied Headquarters' intention to use the imports of other Chinese government agencies to offset the US$10 million debt of the Central Trust Bureau. As a result, the Chinese 資委會 sold iron ore to foreign companies, which resold it to the Allied Headquarters, instead of selling it directly to the Allied Headquarters. The CTB is currently continuing to ship goods from China to Japan and plans to clear its debt within the year. Therefore, the policy adopted by the Allied Headquarters is incomprehensible. When discussing the Allied Headquarters' disregard for the interests of other countries, Wu pointed out that the Allied Headquarters had rejected the Kailuan Mining Bureau's proposal to exchange coal for Japanese mine timber. Wu said that the Allied Headquarters' reason for rejecting it was to protect Japanese forests as much as possible to prevent fires, but on the other hand, Japanese officials and industrialists expressed their willingness to send representatives to Kailuan to exchange mine timber for coal.

<h3>New Platinum Mesh Manufactured by Japanese Government</h3>
<p>Return of Yongli Chemical Plant</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Allied Headquarters will hand over to Yongli Chemical Plant, the largest nitric acid manufacturing plant recently returned to China and highly valued domestically, a newly manufactured platinum mesh in September. The new platinum mesh is currently being manufactured by the Japanese government to replace the seven-jin platinum mesh that was stolen from the plant while it was temporarily kept by Japan before its return. This mesh is an indispensable catalyst for the production of nitric acid and essential for resuming operations. According to the plant's representative here, the plant's reconstruction is expected to be completed by the end of this month. It is also learned that Guangdong Paper Mill, the largest in China, which was completely moved to Hokkaido by Japan during the war, will be completely dismantled before the end of September and transported starting in early October.</p>
<h3>Another Theory on the Cause of the Civilian Aviation Team Plane Burning in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Overloading and Uneven Weight Distribution</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] A Civilian Aviation Team transport plane crashed and burned near Qingdao on the 29th. Some speculate that the cause was sabotage by the communists, but this theory does not seem to have sufficient evidence to support it. According to speculation from local sources, overloading may have had a significant impact. Ordinary transport planes have a maximum load of 40,000 pounds, while this plane reached over 46,000 pounds. Witnesses said that when the plane took off and was about 100 feet from the runway, it suddenly rose sharply at a 45-degree angle and then crashed. It is possible that military supplies and other items were piled up in the plane, causing the weight to be unevenly distributed, which caused a malfunction in some of the machinery, leading to the tragedy. The names of the sixteen Chinese officers and soldiers who died are not available here, as the Civilian Aviation Team does not have a passenger list. Although the team is a civilian aviation organization, its nature is relatively special, and this accident does not seem to have caused general panic or condemnation among the public. It is also said that the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications has not sent anyone to investigate.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Short-Haul Steamer Fare Adjustments</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Yangtze River short-haul steamers recently received approval from the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau to adjust passenger and freight fares starting on the 1st. Freight rates will increase by 150%, and passenger fares will increase by 120%.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st] Ticket prices for steamer routes from Zhenjiang to northern Jiangsu will increase by 57% starting August 1st. Zhenjiang to Huaiyin will cost 4.13 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Assemblymen Request Government to Withdraw Huang Weiguo's Appointment</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changsha, 31st] Huang Weiguo, who was appointed to the Hunan Provincial Government by the Executive Yuan, was originally a member of the Kuomintang. Last year, Huang joined the Democratic Socialist Party and ran for the Legislative Yuan, but he was attacked for his origin and lost the election. The Provincial Assembly now believes that Huang is opportunistic and not qualified to lead the people in assisting provincial administration, and twenty-one members, including Qiu Qifan, have requested the government to withdraw the appointment.</p>
<h3>China Airlines to Consult with Allied Headquarters on Revising Sino-American Air Routes; Shortening Route by 300 Miles via Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] A representative of China Airlines stationed here said that the company will soon consult with the Allied Headquarters on revising the Sino-American air route to eliminate the Guam stop and instead go via Tokyo, shortening the route by 300 miles. The spokesperson said that it is expected that the Allied Headquarters will soon allow Sino-American airliners to make regular "technical landings" in Tokyo. However, since these landings stipulate that passengers and cargo cannot leave the plane, and those not on board cannot enter the plane, once the Allied Headquarters allows China Airlines planes to make regular technical landings in Tokyo, the company must request Washington, through the Chinese government, to allow "transportation landings" in Tokyo. He also said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved China Airlines to operate unscheduled charter flights between Shanghai and Ryukyu, and the Chinese Mission in Japan will soon ask the Allied Headquarters to approve this plan. It is said that an average of 500 passengers per month can be transported between Shanghai and Ryukyu.</p>
<h3>Dalai Lama Holds Grand Assembly to Pray for Victory in Suppressing Rebellion; President Sends Telegram of Commendation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 30th] In view of the communist bandits' treasonous rebellion and poisoning of the people, the Dalai Lama of Tibet, in order to support the central government's suppression of the rebellion and quickly extinguish the bandit atmosphere, initiated a grand assembly to pray for victory in suppressing the rebellion. This assembly began on July 23rd of the Gregorian calendar and was solemnly held at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for three consecutive days. The former and current two Ganden Tripas (the abbot of Ganden Monastery, who inherit the mantle of Master Tsongkhapa) and the two Dharma Kings, Shapa Chokyi and Jangtse Chokyi, presided over the assembly affairs, leading all the Living Buddhas and three thousand monks of the Upper and Lower Tantric Colleges of the Three Great Monasteries in chanting prayers. They also used the supreme power of Tantric Buddhism to light a thousand lamps and piously cultivate the profound "Do-ga" Dharma (this is the most solemn Dharma assembly in Tibet and is not held lightly). In addition, they extensively made offerings in the halls of the most powerful Dharma protectors, such as Jiuqiong Baira Qugadong, to request blessings for miraculous efficacy. At the same time, the Dalai Lama and the Taktra Regent also piously prayed to the Three Great Monasteries. It is reported that before the assembly, the Taktra Regent of Tibet sent a telegram to President Chiang, dispatching Tibetan representatives to pay respects, stating the indignation of the Tibetan political and religious authorities, monks, and people towards the communist bandits' treasonous rebellion and massacre of the people. He also expressed that Tibet is a sacred land of Buddhism and cannot provide military assistance in stopping the communist bandits' insane and brutal acts, but can only pray to the Three Jewels to fundamentally subdue the communist bandits so that the people can enjoy peace and happiness as soon as possible. It is heard that President Chiang has replied with a telegram of commendation and ordered the responsible departments to allocate funds for alms to show encouragement. Chen Xihuang, director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's office in Kangding, attended the assembly at the invitation of the three Kalons of the Kashag.</p>

<h3>Soviet Representative's Tough Stance at Danube River Conference; Firmly Rejects Conditions Proposed by Western Countries</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st, Broadcast: Belgrade News, Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky denounced the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France at the Danube River Conference for pre-judging the conference. Vishinsky said, "We are now encountering the 'ultimatum-like' final demands of the representatives of the three countries attending this conference. These demands are made before drafting any agreement, without any knowledge of the substance of the proposals and the principles on which the new agreement is based. This is the tone of a dictator, not the language of cooperation, and the Soviet Union will firmly reject it. As far as the Soviet delegation is concerned, we are exasperated by such language that does not conform to international gatherings. We will never consider any pressure that the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France attempt to exert on us."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st, Broadcast: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky told the representatives of the Western powers at the Danube River Conference today that if the powers insisted on proposing conditions, the door was wide open for them to leave. The wording was tough, and the representatives of the Western powers unanimously expressed indignation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 31st] France today challenged the Soviet bloc majority at the Danube River Conference here. French representative Thierry said that the French government would not be bound by any new Danube River Convention unless the signatory countries of the current Danube River Statute (including the United States) unanimously agreed. He also said that even though the majority faction is powerful, it cannot change the current statute. It is reported that this is the first time that the Soviet bloc has held a majority in an East-West conference. Thierry's statement opened a discussion of procedural rules. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kamenov was the chairman of the conference today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] After the opening ceremony of the Danube River Conference today, the language issue caused a dispute between the Western powers and the People's Democratic Republics. The conference decided that Russian and French would be the official languages, not English, which was only considered the third working language. The conference was opened by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Shemik, and then Soviet representative Vishinsky proposed the above motion. After three hours of debate, it was passed by a vote of seven to three (United States, Britain, and France). Subsequently, the conference unanimously appointed Mez, Director of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as Secretary-General. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister said in his opening speech that he wished to take this opportunity to state that the Yugoslav government hoped that the outcome of this conference could prove the possibility of establishing international peaceful cooperation between countries with mutually non-interfering economic systems, and prove that it is often possible to reconcile the interests of the Danube River's fully sovereign countries, which are linked by the river's transport. Yugoslavia has proven by deeds rather than empty words its determination to participate in the task of seeking international unity and economic cooperation on the basis of complete equality. He then proposed that each day's meeting should be chaired by the delegations in turn.</p>
<p>[TASS, Belgrade, 30th] The list of heads of delegations from countries participating in the Danube River Conference is as follows: Soviet Union, Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky; Ukraine, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Marminovsky; Czechoslovakia, Foreign Minister Clementis; Romania, Foreign Minister Anna Pauker; Hungary, Foreign Minister Molnar; Bulgaria, Foreign Minister Kamenov; United States, Ambassador to Yugoslavia Cannon; Britain, Ambassador to Yugoslavia Baker; France, Expert Thierry; Yugoslavia, Deputy Foreign Minister Biberle. Austria only sent one observer to attend.</p>
<h3>U.S. Special Envoy Seeks Way to Meet Stalin Directly; Also Holds Separate Talks with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Washington, 31st, Broadcast: A U.S. State Department spokesman said that the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France visited the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs one after another on the 30th to discuss the Berlin issue. He said that this meeting was the first step for the Western countries to seek to lift the Berlin blockade plan. He declined to reveal the nature of the meeting, only saying that U.S. Ambassador Smith visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin at 6 p.m., French Ambassador Chateau visited four hours later, and Britain was represented by Roberts and Harrison, the Chargé d'affaires of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union, who met with Zorin at 10 p.m. Based on the speculation on the situation after Molotov refused to meet the three strong envoys on the grounds of "being on vacation" and the three-nation representatives held talks with Zorin, the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France may seek other ways to negotiate the Berlin issue directly with Stalin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] It is reported that the United States, Britain, and France are willing to discuss the Berlin blockade issue directly with Stalin. According to a report from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Foreign Minister Molotov is currently on vacation" and therefore "cannot" make decisive discussions. If Stalin is also unable to meet, people here believe that Moscow should bear full responsibility for any events caused by the blockade. Representatives of the Western countries want to meet with Molotov to present the three powers' opinions on the blockade and inquire about the price the Soviet Union is asking for to stop the blockade. It is believed that if the Soviet Union agrees to lift the blockade, they will propose discussions on Berlin, Germany, and other European issues. The United States undoubtedly supports direct meetings with Stalin, as the possibility of the situation exploding is very high and cannot be fully handled by diplomatic staff. The State Department declined to comment on whether Molotov's vacation was a "dodge."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] Opinions in political and diplomatic circles here believe that Molotov's departure from Moscow has several explanations. One is that the Kremlin learned that the Western allies intended to make concessions to the Soviet Union, so it decided to buy time and increase the number and nature of those it was holding if four-nation talks were held. Another, more optimistic opinion is that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky is attending the opening ceremony of the Danube River Conference in Belgrade today. This postponement will allow Vishinsky to have the opportunity to contact the U.S. delegation at the conference.</p>
<h3>Currency and Food War in East and West Berlin</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 30th] Berlin's "food rationing war" entered a new stage today.

The Soviet ADN news agency claimed that West Zone residents registered in the Soviet Zone could receive normal rations, including cigarettes, matches, and soap.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 30th] Berlin's "Mark war" also had a new development today. The Soviet authorities ordered the freezing of all deposits of West Zone industrialists in Berlin city banks.</p>
<h3>Szakasits Expected to Succeed Hungarian President; Communist Party Excludes Dissidents</h3>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 31st] The leader of the Smallholders Party, Hungarian President Tildy, announced his resignation after his son-in-law was arrested for treason and sabotage.

<h3>U.S. Republican Lawmakers Oppose Price Controls; Plan to Urge Congress to Adjourn Early</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft announced today that he hopes the Senate can adjourn on August 7th. He also said that he is absolutely opposed to price controls, but he supports Truman's plan to limit bank loans.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] When Taft issued the above statement, it was at a time when other Republican lawmakers were quickly overturning the recommendations of Democratic lawmakers. Members of the People's Livelihood Party had proposed inviting Republican presidential candidate Dewey to Congress to state his views on rising prices. At the same time, those in the Senate who were adopting delaying tactics on public authority issues continued their strategies. Taft expects to "deal with" the anti-poll tax bill on August 4th, but Zhu explained how to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Tempts German Industry to Cooperate with Electricity and Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 31st] On the 31st, the Soviet Union tempted the Berlin industry, which was suffocating under the blockade, to cooperate with the Soviet Union by supplying electricity and raw materials. This suggestion was first seen in the Soviet-backed "Greater Berlin Trading Company," and then the Soviet German News Agency spread it. The agency said that if the German industry in the British, American, and French sectors is willing to follow the Soviet Union's lead, the Greater Berlin Company should supply the necessary supplies, including electricity, and guarantee that the Soviet occupation zone and control zone can be its markets.</p>
<h3>Communist Leader Criticizes Government; Italian Prime Minister Refutes Sharply; Vows to Protect Democracy and Resist Violence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 30th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, with a flushed face and anger, shouted at the Italian Communist Party in Parliament on the evening of the 30th to stop propagating revolution, otherwise they would have to bear the consequences themselves. Communist leader Longo had accused the parliament, and Gasperi gave a twenty-minute impromptu reply, saying: "I am now warning Longo to stop advancing towards violence. If your excellency wants to threaten all classes of people who want to protect their assets and rights, then I can tell you that our responsibility is not only to protect democracy, but also to protect the people and the working class from this terror, and even to encourage them to have the courage to fight. " This was Gasperi's most combative speech since taking office as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Longo read a document criticizing Gasperi and the parliament for an hour, and it is said that this document was written by Togliatti. Gasperi's powerful reply shocked Longo. When Longo mentioned the Communist Party's motion of no confidence in the government, he said that the motion had been withdrawn, "because the government party has a majority, so any discussion in parliament is useless at all." Longo criticized the government's control of the parliament and said: "The government has adopted dangerous policies. The government's laws prohibiting the private possession of arms and other police state measures have led the government down the path followed by the Nazis and fascists." Longo's words angered Gasperi, who stood up and refuted.</p>
<h3>Economic and Social Council Discusses Asian Economic Association Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 30th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council and representatives of Western countries have not yet passed the report of the European Economic Commission after several days of heated debate. The meeting resumed this morning to conduct a general debate on the report of the third meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.</p>
<h3>Taft Advocates Steel Should Be Allotted to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] Republican Senator Taft told the Senate today that he believes the United States "should allot steel for export to South America and China before allotting steel to domestic factories." When asked whether exporting steel to South America and China would affect the increase in steel prices, Taft did not think so. He said that reducing exports would not suppress its price, because domestic demand in the United States would absorb all steel. However, increasing the supply of steel would increase the quantity of steel products. Taft said that he advocated saving the expenses of various government departments, including the expenses of the Economic Cooperation Administration, and believed that the President should save as much as possible within the existing office expenses. He said that the President has the right to reduce the export of steel and other scarce materials without the consent of Congress.</p>

<h3>Mystery of Soviet Foreign Minister's Whereabouts; Rumored to be Attending Comintern Meeting Somewhere</h3>
<p>[United Press, Trieste, 31st] "The Trieste Daily" Paris on the 31st reported that some people believe that Molotov is now in "a certain place in Eastern Europe" to attend a new meeting of the Comintern. It also said that Molotov and Zhdanov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and host of the Comintern, did not appear at the unprecedentedly grand air force parade in Moscow last Sunday. It also said that French Communist Party leader Duclos recently did not participate in the talks between French Communist Party leader Thorez and President Auriol, so "these three major Communist Party figures" are attending a meeting of the Comintern in a certain place in Eastern Europe to discuss the Italian situation after the assassination attempt on Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti and Tito's reply to the Comintern. The newspaper's Paris reporter is one of the top political reporters in Italy.</p>
<h3>American Espionage Activities During Wartime Involving Lippmann</h3>
<p>American Spy Girl Reveals to the Senate</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Washington, 31st Broadcast - Regarding the case of Remington, an official of the U.S. Department of Commerce, accused of leaking war secrets to Soviet spies, U.S. Senators summoned Remington to the Senate Investigating Committee office for questioning on the 31st. Remington, looking around with wide eyes, declared before even taking the witness stand that the accusation was "not factual."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] The mysterious American woman, Bentley, confessed that a high-ranking official in the U.S. Treasury Department was, in fact, one of the leaders of Soviet spies in the United States, providing the Soviets with intelligence on the B-29 Superfortress. According to a photograph published in the Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker, Bentley is a middle-aged woman with deep black hair. Sources familiar with the matter say that the spy network revealed by Bentley is more extensive than the Canadian atomic spy case. Some quarters indicate that Bentley's revelations are related to the recent arrests of Communist leaders. However, others strongly deny this, asserting that the Communist leaders have all been released on bail. Bentley is no longer a beautiful young woman, but an obese woman. She testified before the Senate Un-American Activities Committee that from 1935 to 1944, under the instructions of the Communist Party, she provided political and military intelligence to the Soviet Union. She pointed out that Remington, a senior official in the Department of Commerce (at the time, Chairman of the Export License Review Board for Europe), had leaked detailed information about American aircraft production to her during the war. A copy of this confidential information was made by the well-known journalist Lippmann, formerly of the Department of Commerce, and given to her. Lippmann is currently in North Carolina. Bentley also stated that her contact with Soviet spies was due to her belief in communism, and she felt that the United States was not providing sufficient assistance to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Bernadotte Prepares to Draft New Arab-Jewish Peace Plan; Will Also Attend UN Assembly to Report on Situation in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Lake Success, 30th] United Nations Mediator Count Bernadotte announced today that he will begin his journey to the capitals of Arab countries and Israel on Sunday to determine the reactions of these countries to the basic principles of a new peace plan for Palestine.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Promulgates Anti-Strike Law, Likely to Incite General Strike; Labor Circles Believe MacArthur's Letter Is Not Law</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] The Japanese Cabinet promulgated an order on the 31st prohibiting government employees from striking, even though labor leaders have warned that such an action would order five million public and private workers nationwide to strike in retaliation. The Cabinet order is based on the recommendations in MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Ashida on the 22nd.</p>
<p>The Cabinet's "no-strike" order takes immediate effect and will remain in force until the National Public Service Law is amended by the passage of new legislation in the Diet. Labor leaders have long declared that they do not intend to comply unless the Diet passes the "no-strike" order, so the Cabinet's order is likely to heighten tensions. The labor circle's rhetoric is technically and legally on the verge of defying MacArthur's rule. Observers believe the Allied Headquarters will definitely stand up to support the Cabinet's "no-strike" law.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] According to today's public announcement, the leaders of the three coalition parties of the Japanese government have reached complete agreement on the contents of the future anti-strike law. Prime Minister Ashida held consultations in the Diet this afternoon with former Prime Minister Katayama and Democratic Party President Miki. The three party leaders decided that the Diet will convene in mid-September for a session of approximately 20 days to pass the government ordinance amending the status of civil servants based on MacArthur's request and formulated by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] Five million Japanese workers have declared that they will strike in state-owned and private factories. The chairman of the Japan Transport Workers' Union and member of the "Central Struggle Committee" of government employee unions, Tsuchiji, stated at a meeting with Allied journalists that Japanese workers firmly oppose the implementation of MacArthur's "labor restriction" letter simply through a cabinet order without Diet approval. He stated that if the government does so, five million Japanese workers will immediately strike.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] The leader of the Japan Industry Workers' Congress, Tsuchibashi, told Allied journalists this morning that a general strike of postal and transport workers will take place on August 7th. He stated that he does not recognize MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Ashida as a formal order. "If this letter has more authority than the Constitution, then Japan is no longer a country ruled by law." He praised the resignation of Killen, chief of the Allied Headquarters Labor Division, in protest against the anti-strike legislation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Maritime Police Threatens the Nation</h3>
<p>Declared by Leader of Japanese Industry Congress</p>

<h3>U.S. Rushes to Build Defensive Fortifications in Alaska</h3>

<h3>Korea Requests the U.S. to Provide Military Supplies to Defend Against North Korean Attacks; New Government to Apply for Membership in the United Nations</h3>

She expects this to happen before the United Nations General Assembly in Paris in September. She also revealed that the Korean government has applied for a loan from the United States and is quite close to obtaining it. She hopes that the government can control the entire Korean peninsula, but it will take time.</p>
<h3>Newfoundland Joins the Canadian Federation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 30th] Prime Minister King announced on the 30th that the government has approved Newfoundland's entry into the Canadian Federation and will immediately complete legislative steps with the assistance of the British government.

<h3>A Soviet Veteran's Oral Account of Stalin's War Plan (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviet high command knew that the United States had established radar-like equipment in bases near the Soviet Union (such as Turkey, Greece, China, and Germany). Using this equipment, the United States could detect the location of Soviet atomic bomb factories. To prevent leaks, a large number of "anti-atomic radar" equipment is being actively constructed.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Soviet General Staff was concerned about the oil problem. Given the possibility of the United States using atomic bombs to destroy Soviet offshore oil fields, a huge metal net was placed along the Caspian Sea coast. The placement of this net could prevent radio-controlled atomic bombs from bombarding Soviet oil fields.</p>
<p>V-Weapons While the Soviet Union's achievements in atomic bombs lagged behind the United States, its advantage in V-weapons far surpassed that of the United States. In a recent test near a Siberian test station close to the Kamchatka Peninsula, this type of automatically propelled long-range aerial weapon was able to accurately attack a "target" approximately three to five miles wide within a distance of 900 to 1,300 miles without fail.</p>
<p>As is well known, the main strength of the Soviet Union lies in its massive army. Marshall recently said: "All American combat troops can comfortably sit in a Brooklyn basketball court without feeling crowded." According to the secret instructions of the Soviet General Staff, by the end of 1948, the Soviet Union's peacetime standing army will reach as many as 120 divisions, including 30 airborne divisions, 20 armored divisions, 40 infantry divisions (of which 25 are mechanized), 15 cavalry divisions (of which 8 are mechanized), and 15 artillery divisions (of which 10 are mechanized). The disparity in strength is vast, with the United States lagging far behind the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to defend their industry and avoid atomic bombing, the Soviet Union is also planning to build two to three times as many railways. In this way, when a region's industry is temporarily destroyed, its equipment can be immediately transferred to another region to continue production. At the same time, because the Soviet Union's industry is dispersed in vast areas, the threat of atomic bombs is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Indeed, the atomic bomb is not enough to give the Soviet Union a headache. What the Soviet Union is really uneasy about is not the atomic bomb, but the oil problem. If the oil fields are destroyed at the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union will have no way to obtain enough fuel to complete its three stages of war. If the Soviet Union can only complete the first stage and cannot complete the second stage, then the initiative in the war will inevitably fall into the hands of the United States. At the same time, the original plan to conduct a decisive battle in China alone will also fail. In this way, it will be forced to fight simultaneously in three areas: Chinese mainland, the Near East, the Middle East, and Europe (from Spain to the UK). The danger of fighting on three fronts may lead to tragic consequences. In the event of misfortune, if the war develops to this point, then the Soviet Union will inevitably adopt a long-term war strategy. Because of this possibility, the Soviet Union cannot help but anticipate the outbreak of the next war with great fear.</p>

<h3>General Household Re-Registration Starts Tonight; Lasts for Ten Days; Over 10,000 Personnel Deployed; First Day to Investigate Mobile Population in the City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The city's general household re-registration is scheduled to start from midnight tomorrow morning (i.e., midnight tonight) and will last for ten days. The target of the first day's investigation is the city's mobile population, such as those staying in hostels, inns, and homeless people wandering the streets. According to statistics, about 10,000 or more civilian police, bureau police, and personnel from various districts will be deployed for the investigation. In order to facilitate the investigation and avoid confusion, citizens found cooling off in the streets or sleeping in the open will be advised to return to their homes. It is said that this work must be completed before dawn. From 8:00 a.m. on August 2, the on-land household registration will be conducted in an organized manner. Staff members will carry household registration forms and conduct household registration according to the street address order. For the boat dwellers on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, the Maritime Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau will dispatch 20 speedboats to conduct investigations section by section. In addition, the key points of this general household re-registration are as follows: (1) During the re-registration period, those who fail to report omissions of households or persons will be required to purchase the application form prescribed by the Municipal Government, complete the application procedures, and fill in the changes on the spot according to their type of migration. (2) Those who have moved out of the household registration without prior report will be exempted from filling out the application form, and the Jia chief will apply on their behalf. (3) During the re-registration period, identity cards will be checked. Those who have not obtained an identity card, regardless of men, women, old or young, will be issued an identity card application form on the spot and will be required to submit photos and apply for identity cards in accordance with the prescribed procedures before August 11. (4) During this re-registration period, households that have not been declared due to unclear procedures or other minor reasons will be exempted from investigation, except for a face-to-face order to complete the procedures. However, those who are subsequently found to have omitted households or persons, or who fail to register changes in personnel within three days, will be punished according to law.</p>
<p>Police Department Conducts Surprise Identity Checks on Military Personnel</p>
<p>(Another Report) In order to assist the Municipal Government in completing the general household re-registration and to cooperate, the Police Department has decided to jointly strengthen and expand the surprise identity checks on military personnel with the 9th Gendarmerie Regiment starting on August 2 to prevent illegal elements from taking the opportunity to impersonate military personnel to evade household re-registration. At that time, the Garrison Department and the Gendarmerie Regiment will dispatch all personnel to conduct checks at major traffic arteries and entertainment venues. Once illegal elements are found to be impersonating military personnel, they will be taken into custody for investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The cost of living index for the second half of July in this city has been compiled by the Municipal Government Statistics Office and was released yesterday. The total cost of living index for workers was 1,860,000 times, an increase of 480,000 times compared to the first half of the month. The total cost of living index for staff was 1,500,000 times, an increase of 430,000 times compared to the first half of the month.

<h3>Chief Statistician Reports on Price Increases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Review Committee held its 16th meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The Chief Statistician reported on price increases as follows: Prices increased by less than 20% for green vegetables and cigarettes. Prices increased between 21% and 30% for indica rice, leeks, salted fish, and tea. Prices increased between 31% and 40% for tofu and bean oil. Prices increased between 41% and 50% for flour, fresh beef, fermented bean curd, and twill. Prices increased between 51% and 60% for soybeans, coarse cloth, and flannel. Prices increased between 61% and 70% for bean sprouts, matches, serge, and soap. Prices increased between 71% and 80% for shilin cloth and straw paper. Prices increased between 81% and 90% for fresh fish and socks. There was no change in the prices of public utilities and household rationed rice in the second half of July. After the Chairman finished the report, the committee members carefully reviewed it and considered it satisfactory, and signed the index sheet. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Prepared Separately for the First and Second Halves of the Month</p>
<p>Zhang Zongmeng, Chief Statistician of the Municipal Government, stated to reporters after presiding over the Cost of Living Index Review Committee yesterday: After the cost of living index for this city was published in two phases for July, some people mistakenly believed that the index for the second half of the month represented the entire month of July. The calculation and preparation methods for the indices for the first and second halves of July are completely independent, which is the same as the previous situation of publishing the index on a monthly basis. In addition, there was no change in the prices of public utilities and household rice in the second half of July, and the prices of goods even fell for one week, so the price increase in this period was relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Nylon Stockings Sealed Up Pending Disposal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the last day for selling nylon stockings. Department stores and shops in the city once sold the stockings at reduced prices yesterday, and women were very excited to see them, but due to weak purchasing power, only a limited number of transactions were made. The Municipal Government has issued an order to the Police Bureau, ordering them to be responsible for enforcement starting today. If sales are still found, in addition to confiscating them according to law, those with serious circumstances will be punished in accordance with Article 4 of the Regulations on Punishing Smuggling (this article stipulates that those who knowingly transport, sell, or hide smuggled imported or exported goods shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than two years, or detention). In addition, the Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the registered companies and shops to seal up unsold inventory and report it to the Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Hotel Industry Adjusts Room Rates, Increasing by 35% Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the hotel industry's request to adjust room rates, the Municipal Council of Social Affairs invited representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and representatives from both labor and management of the industry to hold a review meeting yesterday afternoon.

<h3>Gold Shops Only Accept Gold, Do Not Sell</h3>
<p>Although there was a listed price for gold jewelry in gold shops yesterday, in reality, they only accepted gold and refused to sell it at all. According to people in the industry, there are two reasons for refusing to sell: (1) The price of gold has increased due to the increase in the price of foreign exchange certificates. The general public believes that the price of gold is about to rise again, and they are rushing to buy it, which may create a real price increase, so sales have been temporarily suspended. (2) The Central Bank has not yet allowed the allocation of gold blocks or bars. If a large amount is sold, it can be sold out in a short period of time. The industry currently only hopes that customers will use old gold jewelry to exchange for new gold jewelry, and charge a small labor fee to maintain the livelihood of the workers.</p>
<h3>Passenger and Freight Transportation by Ship Will Increase in Price Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association and the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: On the 31st, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Transportation requesting approval of the freight rate adjustment rate decided by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Association on the 30th. The adjustment ratio is: passenger and freight transportation on the north-south coastal lines will increase by 80% of the original price. The passenger fare on the Yangtze River line from Shanghai to Yichang will be specially increased by 120% of the original price due to the special overcrowding of passengers running single businesses, and it is planned to be held from next Monday (August 2).</p>

Therefore, she expressed her deep desire to return to her hometown and die in her native land.</p>

<h3>Deeply Feeling the Pain of Being Deprived of Education, Generously Donates 100 Million Yuan to Help Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a businessman-like person came to our newspaper office and donated 100 million yuan as a "reader scholarship." He said that because his family was poor when he was young, he was deprived of education after reaching the elementary school level. Over the past 20 years, because he was determined to work hard, he gradually consolidated his economic status. Although he cannot be called wealthy at present, he is able to make a sufficient living. Recalling the pain of being deprived of education in his youth, he expressed particular sympathy and concern for the impoverished students in society. The 100 million yuan he is donating now is entirely his savings from frugality, and today he donates all of it as a scholarship, which is only a small expression of sympathy.</p>
<p>In this society, there are countless people living a life of luxury, with bright lights, green wine, and spending thousands of dollars at a time. If they could economize on extravagance and use it to help countless poor students, wouldn't it be a very meaningful thing?</p>
<h3>Rampant Venereal Disease in the City: Prostitutes Largely Evading Inspection; Prevention and Treatment Center Strives to Salvage the Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the lack of thorough management by the authorities, the number of prostitutes in the city has been increasing in recent years along with the dramatic changes in the economic situation. As a result, venereal diseases have become increasingly rampant. Although the city's Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center now conducts monthly inspections of registered public prostitutes, Director Yu Wei told reporters that this work faces many difficulties. Most prostitutes are unwilling to register with the police, with registered prostitutes accounting for only one-tenth of the total. Of those registered, only one-tenth receive timely inspections at the center. Forced treatment cannot be thoroughly implemented. At the same time, many new prostitutes, secret prostitutes, and disguised prostitutes evade inspections in various ways. Currently, the center estimates that it inspects about 3,000 prostitutes per month, but the actual number of prostitutes in the city is at least 100,000 or more. Almost all of them have gonorrhea, and about 65% have syphilis. Furthermore, according to statistics from various sources, about 15% of the city's residents have syphilis, and 40% have gonorrhea. The situation is more serious than tuberculosis. Therefore, even if prostitutes pass the inspection and are allowed to operate, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not contract venereal diseases again within 25 minutes. He said that Hong Kong, with a population of one million, has five venereal disease prevention and treatment centers. This city, with a population of five million, has only one. Therefore, it is difficult to expect satisfactory results in the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Quick Treatment Method: Cured in Ten Days</p>
<p>However, the center is still striving to research quick treatment methods. Using the latest penicillin oil emulsion, injected once a day, early syphilis can be cured in just ten days, with an effectiveness rate of over 96%. Meanwhile, emphasis is placed on education to reduce the chance of transmission as much as possible. In the future, it is planned to conduct home visits to those with venereal diseases, syphilis screening for pregnant women, promote premarital checkups, and select one prostitute from each of 25 brothels for three months of venereal disease education, so that they can be spontaneously aware of the terribleness of venereal diseases and widely learn prevention methods.</p>
<p>Treating 1,100 People Per Month</p>
<p>In addition to regular prostitute inspections, the center is also working to treat venereal diseases among residents. Currently, it treats an average of about 1,500 people per month. Director Yu believes that venereal disease is not an incurable disease and should never be hidden from doctors, as it can harm future generations. To this day, it is a well-known fact that early treatment of venereal disease is very easy to cure.</p>
<p>At present, it is impossible to eliminate venereal disease in a metropolis like this city. However, if all prostitutes are strictly registered, and if, like in European and American countries, red-light districts are designated and properly managed, with those who are sick receiving centralized treatment and those who are not sick being responsible for prevention by the brothel keepers, then it should be possible to reduce the chance of venereal disease transmission to the lowest possible level.</p>
<p>Military Vehicles Must Present Certificates for Gasoline</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command issued a public notice yesterday, stating that the city's gasoline quota has been repeatedly reduced. Regarding military purchases of emergency fuel, it has been decided after convening a meeting of relevant military agencies in the city that, starting from August 1st, military vehicles must present a fuel purchase certificate issued by the Command (which will be collected by the gas station and submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for verification) when purchasing emergency gasoline at gas stations; otherwise, supply will be refused.</p>

<h3>Child's Lock Charm Snatched; Thief Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Bisheng, 17 years old, from Jiangbei, resides at No. 1 Qingfeng Lane, Dapu Bridge. At around 3:30 PM on the 27th of last month, in front of No. 168 Zhoujiazui Road in Pudong, police saw Li Wang Xiuying's son, only five years old. Liu, seeing that no one was around, bought a watermelon and gave it to the child, and then snatched his silver lock charm and fled. The child cried incessantly. Xiuying heard the sound and went to check, discovering that the silver lock charm around his neck was gone. She chased after Liu and brought him to the Tilanshan Police Station. According to his confession, on the same morning, he had also robbed Luo Yu Jinlian's son (named Kunzi) of a silver neck ring on Emei Road using the same method and escaped. The branch bureau charged him with robbery and transferred him to the court for investigation.</p>

<h3>On the Budget for the Second Half of This Year</h3>
<p>Continued from the Monday Forum on page two</p>
<p>We must understand that China has received considerable international credit and assistance during the War of Resistance and after the war. This international credit, that is, the acquisition of foreign loans, represents the result of the international evaluation of China's national wealth. When foreign countries loan to a country, they consider not only political relations but also economic relations. If China does not possess a considerable amount of national wealth, the amount of international credit it obtains will inevitably be very small. If there are no political relations and only reliance on economic relations, it is possible that nothing will be obtained. However, today's China has only become trusted by foreign countries, but is not trusted by its own people, and is even not trusted by some high officials in the Chinese government itself. This is the strangest phenomenon in the world. It also fully shows the low level of national consciousness among Chinese citizens and even officials. Especially in the expression of the urban market, it fully shows that the actions of ordinary speculators are similar to acts of treason. For example, if it is heard that the negotiations between China and the United States for loans are not going smoothly, the black market price of the US dollar will immediately soar. If it is heard that the government army has suffered a temporary setback on the front line, the prices of all commodities will suddenly soar again. Every move of such political, military, and diplomatic dynamics becomes the speculative material of opportunists. How sad!</p>
<p>I advise government officials and people that we must first recognize how huge the potential value of China's national wealth is. According to my estimation, the value of China's national wealth is approximately two trillion pre-war legal currency. If we calculate today's legal currency based on a 4 million-fold increase in prices, it is worth 8 million trillion legal currency. This includes 1.34677 trillion pre-war legal currency of China's underground resources. China is actually not poor. If it were a poor country, Japanese imperialism would never have been willing to devote all its efforts to attempt to conquer China. Now, the government has neither the advanced technology to develop underground resources, nor the ability to manage the state-owned property already on the ground due to the ignorance and incompetence of the responsible officials. It cannot focus on key areas when spending, and only knows how to follow the past and use issuance to make up for deficits. The national finance will naturally decline. Using issuance to fill wartime financial resources is recognized in both wartime financial facts and theories, but it is necessary to know that after using issuance, it must be matched with public debt policies and tax policies. Because wartime military needs are vast and urgent, if the income from taxes and public debt is used for expenditure again, it will have a great impact on military affairs. Therefore, increasing income through issuance first, and secretly using the purchasing power created by the government to purchase military supplies and labor from the market, was originally a temporary measure, not a permanent policy. Now the government has been implementing this temporary emergency measure of inflation policy for too long, and has become accustomed to it. The people are well aware of this situation, so the credibility of legal currency is gradually declining, so that today no one believes in legal currency. Because the credibility of legal currency is gradually declining, the government is also panic-stricken, and has never made a fundamental plan. The people actually believe that China is on the eve of economic collapse. As the facts have evolved to this day, the government is still continuing to expand the issuance of legal currency by continuing to make mistakes, but the scope of legal currency circulation is becoming narrower and narrower, and the speed of circulation is getting faster and faster. People have unconsciously established another kind of "currency" to replace legal currency, such as commodities, gold, silver dollars, foreign currencies, etc. Under this situation, if the government continues to be ignorant and continue to use the inflation policy, this is really a measure to deceive oneself to the extreme!</p>
<p>In my opinion, if we compare the total accumulated amount of legal currency issued today with the rate of price increases, the actual value of the amount of legal currency issued is only five to ten times lower than before the war. The amount of legal currency issued in my country before the war was approximately 1.4 billion yuan. If we convert today's legal currency at 4 million times the price, the amount of legal currency issued today should be 5.6 million trillion yuan. And before the war, the Northeast and Taiwan were not included. If the amount of legal currency issued today includes the circulating notes in the Northeast and the Taiwan dollar, the total amount may not have reached 1 trillion. Since the amount of legal currency issued has not reached the saturation point, why is there a feeling in the market that legal currency is flooded in the market? This point is enough to prove that due to the decline in the credibility of legal currency, the scope of legal currency circulation has become narrower and narrower. Today, the market and the people have invisibly established another kind of "currency" to replace the position of legal currency. Cities mostly use gold and US dollars, and rural areas mostly use silver dollars and white rice. Currency was originally created to facilitate barter in primitive times, from the initial shells, stones, knives, and silks to gold and silver, and then evolved to today's paper currency. However, in the current stage in China, currency has formed a historical regression!</p>
<p>As China's finances have evolved to the present stage, financial policies must be thoroughly reformed in order to cope with the real environment. Otherwise, the budget proposal for the second half of this year will still only become a formality in practice. This kind of formalism, that is, the budget of deception, will not only not be able to bear the heavy responsibility of suppressing the chaos and building the country, but will also deepen the political and economic crisis. The lessons of the past three years should be deeply recognized by the whole country, and we must never listen to the government's officials who are perfunctory and harm the country and the people.

<h3>Strolling on Mogan Mountain</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Quick Dispatch from Our Newspaper Mogan Mountain, 30th] The Presidential Temporary Residence on Mogan Mountain is owned by Chen Yongqing, a director of the Xingye Bank. The house is located at the top of the ridge, with six buildings. The management bureau numbered the addresses as 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, and 556, number 6 is owned by five giants in the maritime banking industry. 551 was built by Xu Jiguan. Because they were like-minded, they built houses on the mountain together and came to the mountain to escape the summer heat together every year. Therefore, it is named Wuyou Village (Five Friends Village). One of the houses is a kitchen and storage room, etc. The other five houses have the same construction style and all have sanitary facilities. There are only two roads leading to this Wuyou Village in the mountains: one is on the left side of the Mogan Mountain Hotel, following the road up, and the other is a small road on the back mountain.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang rarely goes out when residing on the mountain. She has been on the mountain for three days and only strolled on the mountain road with the President on the evening of the 27th. The President wore a gray silk long gown, and Madame wore a Western-style silk casual outfit and a large sun hat. It is said that Madame reads books in the residence and sometimes flips through the residents' roster.</p>
<p>The prices on the mountain are the highest in the hotels. A night costs 8 million yuan, which is only for an ordinary hotel with a single room. High-end hotels cost 20 to 30 million yuan per day. Food is outside, costing about 20 million yuan a day, so a day costs 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>The best scenery on Mogan Mountain is Jianchi (Sword Pond). Jianchi has a waterfall that falls in three levels. A pavilion has been built, and the place where the water flows down is surrounded by a permanent mud fence for bathing. Many foreign women bring bras and wear briefs to bathe here. This place is where the ancient Wu and Yue generals Mo and Xie sharpened their swords. An old man in the mountains told reporters: It was very suitable for the ancients to sharpen their swords here, one because the water was clear, two because the stone quality was good, and three because the mountain produced snakes that leaped like sharp swords unsheathed.</p>
<p>Mogan has Luhua Dang (Reed Flower Pond), which is a mountain spring. The water quality is very good and tastes sweet. Westerners have tested the water and found it to be non-toxic and beneficial, so people from far and near come here to fetch water for drinking without having to re-boil it.</p>
<p>There are the most butterflies on the mountain, with different shapes. In the past, various universities came to this mountain to collect insect specimens. In the summer noon, the sound of cicadas is endless, and there are occasional sounds of "chirping" insects, which are very pleasant.</p>
<p>The mountains are full of secluded valleys. According to the mountain people, bamboo has a pure atmosphere, which can absorb the most carbon dioxide and emit the most oxygen, so it is most suitable for recuperation in the mountains.</p>

<h3>Gaoyou Rice Seedlings Drowned; Disaster-Stricken Fields Exceed 200,000 Mu</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Gaoyou, 28th] Situated on the border of Jiangsu Province, the mountain floods of Anhui Province and the tidal currents of the Yangtze River all flow into the county through the Qingyi River. The Dongba dike is blocking the way, with no way to discharge the water. This summer, the rain and tides are rising rapidly. The water level is only an inch above the level of the commoners' homes. The rice seedlings have been drowned, and the disaster-stricken fields are approximately 200,000 mu or more, accounting for two-thirds of the county's area. Continuous rain in recent days has not yet escaped the danger. It was resolved at the meeting to send telegrams to all parties appealing for joint efforts to raise funds and participate in disaster relief.</p>

<h3>Journey Beyond the Pass (1) Leaving Jiayuguan, the Sand is Boundless</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Air Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jiuquan, 28th] Leaving Jiayuguan, tears never dry! This is how the ancients described the bleak and resentful mood of traveling to the Western Regions. But at present, due to the development of transportation, this mood has long been diluted by time. The "beyond the pass" mentioned here starts from Jiayuguan, 24 kilometers west of Jiuquan, and includes the Dunhuang Prefecture established in the Han Dynasty, that is, the current Yumen, Anxi, and Dunhuang counties, plus the Mazong Mountain (eastern branch of the Tianshan Mountains, that is, the current Subei Administration Bureau), which guards the three provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. Its total area is more than 309,700 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Various travelogues provide descriptions of the scenery along the way from Jiuquan to Dunhuang, and the importance of Mazong Mountain in national defense since the "independence" of Outer Mongolia has also gradually become known. However, under the slogan of "equal emphasis on national defense and people's livelihood", what is the current situation of the three counties and one bureau beyond the pass? This is also a matter of concern to the people of the country. This time, after the reporter followed the Lanzhou and other local reporters' tour group to Subei, he specially visited various places to interview the local military and political leaders, public opinion representatives, and the people multiple times. Of course, this kind of cursory interview is not entirely accurate, but due to the limitations of time, transportation, and security, thanks to the sincere words of the local people, and after several times of comparison and comparison, we can get a glimpse of the general situation beyond the pass.</p>
<p>Admiring the Majestic Pass When the reporter arrived in Jiuquan, it was about 5:00 PM on July 9th. In order to go to visit the opening of the new wells of the Yumen Ganqing Oil Mine Factory as soon as possible, the next day we set off for the mine. After the car traveled more than 20 kilometers west, the majestic appearance of Jiayuguan came into view, and the beacon towers and the densely packed telephone poles flew past the car window from time to time. The beacon tower was an effective tool for transmitting military intelligence in ancient times. The telecommunications equipment that echoes it now creates a sense of vicissitudes of time.</p>
<p>Jiayuguan is located at the western foot of Jiayu Mountain between the Qilian Mountains and Yanzhi Mountain. A Mongolian folk song says: "Losing my Qilian Mountains, makes my six livestock not breed; losing my Yanzhi Mountain, makes my women without color!" The soil color of Yanzhi Mountain is very red, really like rouge, which contrasts interestingly with the white snow that never melts on the Qilian Mountains all year round.</p>
<p>Towering City Towers There are different opinions about the construction age of Jiayuguan, but it was definitely not built during the Qin Dynasty. Historical Records: "Qin ordered Meng Tian to lead 300,000 troops to recover the land south of the Yellow River, build the Great Wall, starting from Lintao to Liaodong, extending more than 10,000 li." At that time, Hexi was the territory of the Yuezhi Kingdom, which was originally a Western Rong land. The Qin Dynasty's jurisdiction had not yet reached here, and Lintao during the Qin Dynasty should be in the territory of Minxian County in present-day Gansu. Later, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty opened up the four prefectures of Hexi and ordered Lu Bode to build a border wall to defend against the Xiongnu, starting from the Gaolan Yellow River in the east and reaching Jiayu Mountain in Jiuquan in the west. This was the initial period of Jiayuguan's creation. Subsequently, the boundaries of successive dynasties have repeatedly changed, and the border walls have naturally been repaired and added to. It was not until the fifth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty that Jiayuguan was completed with repairs and patching. The pass has two layers, inner and outer, all built of huge bricks. The city towers stand tall, towering and majestic. On both sides of the city foot outside the pass, there are stone strike marks for judging the good and bad luck after leaving the pass, called "Knocking the Pass". It is said that if there is an echo when throwing stones, you can survive, otherwise you will be buried in a foreign land. Therefore, although the traces of damage caused by hundreds of years have been repeatedly filled, passers-by are still constantly striking them into powder. The terrain outside the pass is steep, so it is difficult to see its height in the photo. A stone tablet with the inscription "The World's Majestic Pass" stands a bow shot away from the pass, with large characters in the style of a great master, and the three characters "Jiayuguan" written by the President when he visited in the 31st year, which were originally prepared to be inscribed on the top of the pass. After the President returned to Chongqing, he urgently telegraphed here, forbidding the obliteration of the original historical sites. Therefore, these three large characters, one foot square, have been built into a monument and erected at the foot of the Qilian Mountains.</p>
<p>Hangu Pass is a Ball of Mud When Lin Zexu was demoted to Xinjiang and passed through Jiayuguan, he wrote a poem: "The strict pass is hundreds of feet dividing the west of the sky, and the travelers on ten thousand-mile journey stop their horses. The flying pavilion is connected to the straight Qin trees in the distance, and the encircling wall obliquely presses down the clouds of Long. The steep Tianshan Mountains stand shoulder to shoulder, and the vast sea stretches into the misty distance. Who says that Hangu Pass has been a dangerous place for thousands of years, looking back, it is just a ball of mud."</p>
<p>This poem can describe the true situation of that year. When we visited the pass, because the Taoist was not there, we could not buy the key to climb the pass and look into the distance to appreciate the vast and boundless scenery outside the pass. I just felt that this westernmost majestic pass of the Great Wall has lost its national defense value and is only for people to commemorate. New trees have been planted near the pass, reaching 200,000 trees. In the grass without the ankle, there are gurgling springs flowing. One of the oil company's farms is also located here, often planting wheat and vegetables and transporting them to the mine. To the south of the pass is Qishu Mountain, and to the north is Mazong Mountain. The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway lies on the Gobi Desert like a giant python. Looking into the distance, the sand is boundless, and the degree of desolation is even greater than inside the pass. At this time, the wind and clouds changed, and sand and stones flew. Mr. Li Qinghan, the guide, pointed to the oil mine, which was shrouded in a misty rain curtain.</p>

<h3>Household Rice Ration Prices Increased; Rice Market Robust and Prices Soaring</h3>
<p>Flour, Grains, Oil, and Cakes All Rise, Moving Towards Peaks Together</p>
<p>Rice prices surge straight up, due to the increase in the household rice ration price to 32,000,000 yuan in August, a rise of 220%, which has strengthened people's resolve. Merchants are taking the opportunity to exert their efforts to push prices up, with increases ranging from 4,000,000 to 6,000,000. Special japonica rice rose to 44,000,000, an increase of 4,500,000. White japonica rice, White Yuan, milled indica rice, and coarse pointed rice each rose by 1,000,000. Thin rice increased by 5,500,000. Early rice, Yin Yuan, coarse japonica rice each rose by 6,000,000. Only new japonica rice rose by 4,000,000. Jiangxi machine-milled late rice rose by 4,500,000. Total arrivals in the city amounted to 3,162 piculs.</p>
<p>Flour continues to advance towards peaks, due to the sharp rise in the rice market and tight money.

<h3>Narrow Range of Fluctuations; Vague Process for Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were quite vague yesterday. Off-exchange trading looked stable, with only yarn and cloth slightly rebounding near noon. With both loose and excessive money supply, and the President's arrival in Shanghai, public sentiment increased apprehension. The imminent implementation of the New Economic Policy may bring many favorable factors, leading to a half-day process of ambivalence.</p>
<p>The morning opened cautiously, with Yong Yarn retreating to 12,200 yuan. Numbers 76, 206, 185, 163, 178, 169, 204, and 119 advanced to 12,500 yuan. Numbers 205, 56, 151, 218, 145, 16, 102, and 116 were sold at 12,250 yuan.

Numbers 154, 169, 65, 116, 71, 89, 85, and 61 were all sold, retreating to 12,480 yuan. Although there was a rebound afterward, it was extremely unstable. Numbers 135, 69, 156, and 117 were closed out, falling to 12,330 yuan. Numbers 56, 163, 197, 226, 224, 143, 131, and 95 were all entered, rising to 12,700 yuan. Numbers 117, 56, 82, 213, 235, 176, and 187 were sold off. Near noon, news of a rebound in yarn and cloth caused a retreat to 12,350 yuan. The noon close was maintained by numbers 205, 55, 197, 169, 98, 119, and 226, rising to 12,600 yuan. Except for Huaxin, which fell to its limit and then rebounded, with a slight decrease of 10%, Xinyi, Yong Yarn, Xinguang, Liana, and Matches were still flat. Datong and Zhabei were down slightly, while Meilin, Tongmeng, Yonggong, and Five and Harmony were up slightly. The rest were down slightly. Among off-exchange unlisted stocks, except for Dasheng and Xinxin showing a trend towards prosperity, the rest saw fluctuating rises and falls.</p>
<p>Government bonds were active yesterday as loose money supply and the New Economic Policy attracted buyers. Tong Bing opened in the morning at 1,140,000, fell to 1,110,000, and rebounded to close at 1,160,000. Rooms 503 and Chengde sold, while rooms 552, 360, and 500 all entered. Compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi rose by 90,000 yuan, Bing rose by 120,000 yuan, Ding rose by 110,000 yuan, and Wu rose by 100,000 yuan, with 2,000,000 traded.</p>

<h3>National Banks' Net Outflow Exceeds 5 Trillion</h3>

<h3>Qihong Trend Firm</h3>
<p>This year's Qimen black tea, with soaring purchasing costs, has been firmly held by sellers, and the market yesterday showed an increasing reluctance to easily part with it. It is understood that this variety has been sold to Turkey in considerable quantities over the years. According to recent reports, tea is in high demand there, and our authorities have already notified the National Federation of Commerce, reporting prices and quantities, thus frequently leading to higher tea prices here and an increasingly firm stance. As for the Chun Mee and other green teas sold to North Africa, they are also scarce due to hoarding by holders, but exporters are hesitant due to high prices, so the market continues with few transactions, lacking change. As for domestic tea, the street and regional dealers each added to their stocks, and the market atmosphere was as stable as ever.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Weak; Prices of Most Grades Fall by About 10%</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market, due to consecutive sharp rises and new peaks appearing, inevitably saw a weakness in public sentiment. There were also rumors in the market unfavorable to buying, and spinning companies continued to open five varieties, including 20-count Shuangdiqiu, increasing the supply of chips in the market. Therefore, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn initially fell slightly by 110 million. Midway, upon hearing of a rise in the stock market, sellers pushed up prices, rebounding to a high of 2.15 billion yuan. Monday's shipments were also high at 2.22 billion.</p>
<p>Subsequently, due to the end of the month, the money supply in the industry tightened, and those urgently needing funds took advantage of the high prices to cash out. Retailers also followed suit and sold off, ultimately closing at 2.005 billion, a decrease of 110 million from the previous day. Monday's shipments were at 2.1 billion, also down 100 million yuan. 21-count Shuangma yarn fell slightly by 130 million due to more sellers than buyers after opening. The overall trend for the day, except for the firm and stable 10-count Delitongzi army and other coarse yarns, saw most other coarse and fine yarns soften by about 10%, with only 54 bales traded.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened in the morning with the news that the authorities were stabilizing the economy and would announce new measures, emphasizing price controls, which caused public sentiment to be weak, with fewer new buyers and more sellers. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at a lower price, but due to compensatory purchases by cloth merchants and retailers, and the rumor that 250,000 customs gold would be officially issued starting next week, the market sentiment suddenly became firm. The market quickly rose sharply to 59.1 million yuan with transactions.</p>
<p>Near the noon close, Fangjian Company suspended the distribution of Longtou fine cloth, and the price gap between the mid-grade Wufu and Laba Tong fine cloths and Longtou was too large, reaching as much as 7 or 8 million, triggering a general buying of Wufu and Laba Tong while selling Longtou. Furthermore, with tight money, retailers cut and sold, and the final Longtou fine cloth still closed slightly lower at 57 million, leveling with the previous day and falling by 2 million compared to the off-exchange price. Laba Tong mid-grade goods saw a slight increase of 500,000 due to more compensatory purchases.</p>
<p>In addition, Yuan Bij from Sijunzi and others rose by another 500,000 due to purchases by Sichuanese dealers. Jinlian Miaowu closed well at 6 million, and other bleached cloth, Shilin cloth, blue cloth, Yuan cloth, and Nafutuo, etc., each rose by another 1 to 1.5 million, with a total of 1,800 pieces traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>Another report: It is said that the filling price of the Longtou fine cloth distributed by Fangjian Company was 57.8 million yuan, and it is understood that each household is only allowed to purchase one piece, causing public sentiment to become firm. Finally, bids were made with an added price of 2 to 3 million, and transactions were not bad, similar to Sijunzi Bij.</p>
<p>Another report: China Textile yesterday followed the usual practice of selling more than ten types of cotton yarn, approving 462 purchase orders, selling 20,990 pieces of cotton cloth and 130 quilts. Also, Fangjian Company yesterday sold three types of yarn in the cotton yarn market on behalf of the Yarn Control Board, totaling 954 bales, with a value of 78.99 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Unified Purchase of Cotton Certificates to Be Abolished from Today</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Yarn Control Board has decided that the cotton purchase certificates and transportation certificates for unified purchase of cotton, as well as the Shanghai cotton movement certificates, will be abolished from today (August 1st), and has announced this to the entire country, it is said.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Exchange Yarn Ratio Not Yet Specifically Calculated</h3>
<p>The private factories in this city are concerned that the reported U.S. aid cotton exchange yarn ratio advocates exchanging one bale of yarn (including labor costs) for 577 pounds of cotton, and they have inquired with the Sixth District Association to ascertain its accuracy. According to the person in charge of the association, the yarn-for-cotton ratio should be calculated based on the international market price of exported yarn and cloth compared to the foreign cotton price (including freight, tariffs, and other expenses). The technical team has not specifically calculated how many pounds of cotton can actually be exchanged.</p>
<h3>Rayon Allocation Price Determined</h3>
<p>[Our report] The China Trust Bureau's rayon meeting yesterday decided that the brand price of rayon for the first week of August 2nd to 7th would be 16,980,000 yuan per box for Italian rayon.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi: [Our Wuxi, 31st dispatch] The trend of various commodities is firm, continuing to rise. Shanghai dealers are approaching the fourth barrier. White japonica opened at 39.24 million, Baiyuan at 37.54 million, Yangxian at 39.74 million, japonica rice at 16.72 million, wheat at 27.5 million, white wheat at 30.3 million, flour at 12.23 million, soybean oil at 86.9 million, and cotton yarn at 148 million. In addition, the county government recently cracked down on a large-scale underground money house inside the Jinfeng Socks Factory on Zhongshan Road, and two important officials have been interrogated and detained.</p>
<p>Bengbu: [Our Bengbu, 31st dispatch] The grain market is still fluctuating. Wheat has risen to 42 million, soybeans are high at 54 million, long rice has fallen to 42 million, and edible oil has soared.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry to Discuss Improvement of Collection and Settlement Methods with Various Industries</h3>
<p>Various industries can only settle their bills with the silver and money industry in the morning, so those who hold bank and money house cashier's checks cannot be included in the exchange after noon and must wait until the next day. For firms short on cash, even if they have funds, they cannot exchange and offset them, and they must separately collect cash to compensate, which is very difficult. The transfer application form, which various industries used to allocate funds in the afternoon, has been ordered to be prohibited, stating that this application form is limited to the silver and money industry for its own use and cannot be issued to meet the needs of customers. For more than a month, various industries have felt excessively restricted in their capital turnover and believe that the silver and money industry must find a way to remedy this. The Cotton Cloth Dyeing and Weaving Associations therefore presented reasons and listed remedial measures a few days ago: (1) Extend the bill collection time by two hours, (2) Increase the number of cashier's check exchanges, (3) Open up transfer application forms. They jointly requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association, with more than 70 industry associations from commerce and industry co-signing. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has received replies from the two silver and money industry associations and has scheduled to invite various industries to discuss the measures at the Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on August 2nd. The silver and money industry has indicated to the Chamber of Commerce that the restriction on transfer application forms has in fact been slightly relaxed. As for the extension of bill collection and the increase in the number of cashier's check exchanges, it is due to limitations of manpower and expenses, and not a lack of understanding of the difficulties faced by various industries, it is said.</p>

<h3>Lou Wenao Ranks 17th in 10,000-Meter Race; Circled Among Top Five at 2,000 Meters; Crowd Cheers After Completing Full Distance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th dispatch] (Delayed) Our country's athlete Lou Wenao, who participated in the World Games 10,000-meter race, failed today afternoon when past long-distance masters of the World Games met at Wembley Stadium. There were 30 starters, and Lou Wenao ranked 17th, but he was the last person to run the full distance and cross the finish line. The other 13 people, including Finnish world 10,000-meter record holder Heino, all dropped out halfway shortly after the start. After running 2,000 meters, Lou Wenao was in the top five and maintained that position for 500 meters, but ultimately could not compete with the leading runners' amazing strides. At 7,000 meters, Lou Wenao was more than 400 meters behind the Czech Zatopek, who showed no signs of fatigue. When Lou completed the full distance, a group of ecstatic spectators gave him a warm cheer. Zatopek also set a new World Games record this time - 29 minutes 59.6 seconds. World 10,000-meter record holder Heino (29 minutes 35.4 seconds) followed behind, but was exhausted and withdrew 3,200 meters from the finish line, staggering like a drunk.</p>
<h3>Zatopek Wins 10,000-Meter Championship</h3>
<p>[Our report] London, 30th broadcast: Czech youth officer Zatopek ran 10,000 meters in 29 minutes 59.6 seconds, breaking the Olympic record of 30 minutes 11.4 seconds set by Poland's Ruszowski in Los Angeles in 1932, amidst the ecstatic cheers of 70,000 spectators. Zatopek's steady pace and determined attitude caused world record holder Heino to retreat, abandoning the race halfway.</p>
<p>London was overcast today, and the scorching sun had retreated. The oppressive heat wave of the past few days has subsided. A total of 27 athletes participated. At the sound of the starting gun, Finland's Heino took the lead, followed by Sweden's Arbison and Finland's Lem Jon. In the third lap, Heino and Arbison were still leading, and Hysekum (Finland) and Kodjia (France) surpassed Lem Jon one after another, following behind. Zatopek was mixed in with the ten or so people at the rear, not showing his strength. In the seventh lap, this unassuming Czech youth gradually emerged, and the leading Nordic generals began to feel the threat. In the ninth lap, Zatopek suddenly flew past like a meteor, overtaking Storken (Norway), Kodjia, Arbison, Hysek Ma, and Heino one after another, and from then on, he sped away, straight to the finish line. Heino, after being overtaken by 30 meters, knew that he could no longer compete and dropped out halfway. Zatopek, also due to a lack of competition, failed to break Heino's world record of 29 minutes 35.4 seconds set in 1937. Zatopek was about 300 meters ahead of second-place Kodjia when he reached the finish line. Sweden's Arbison and Danov won third and fourth place, Norway's Storken fifth, and Belgium's Eferle sixth.</p>

Second place went to Anderson of Ohio State University, and third place to Lee Gavit, both also American athletes. The finals took place while the hammer throw event was also underway, so the audience was only around a thousand people. The qualification for the hammer throw was 160 feet 9 and 1/8 inches. American athlete Bennett threw 167 feet 8 and 1/4 inches on his first attempt. The weather suddenly cooled down, making athletes and spectators feel much more comfortable.

As the Stars and Stripes were raised on the champion's flagpole, the unofficial national team scores had the United States jumping to 19 points. France remained in the lead with 21 points, but according to World Games regulations, there is no overall national championship.</p>

<h3>Our Basketball Team's Unfavorable Start - First Battle Lost to Chile - Difference of Five Points - Many Missed Free Throws Waste Good Opportunities</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, July 31st broadcast: The Chinese basketball team had an unfavorable start today, losing its first battle to Chile by a difference of five points. The process was extremely tense. In the first half, it was 19 to 18, with Chile winning by only one point. The situation in the second half was even more intense. The Chilean team's actions were excessive, and China had many opportunities for free throws, but due to excessive psychological tension, they missed many, thus wasting good opportunities. The audience regretted this. Among them, Bao Songyuan missed six free throws, Cai Zhongqiang missed three, Wu Chengzhang missed two, and Yu Ruizhang also missed three. If half of these 14 shots had been made, the Chinese team could have won. In this game, Cai Wenhua and Wu Chengzhang were the most outstanding. Cai scored a total of 15 points, and Wu also scored 9 points. The other players were abnormal. This World Games basketball tournament is using a round-robin system. If the Chinese team wins in the next few games, there is still hope to be among the top teams.</p>
<p>Reasons for Failure</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, July 31st] Our basketball team lost to the Chilean team in the first game by a score of 44 to 39 after a hard battle. Our team was not at its best in tonight's 40-minute game. The game showed that the team lacked significant point scorers. Only Cai Wenhua's long shots and Bao Songyuan's quick rushes and one-handed shots scored more points. The first 20 minutes of the first half were a back-and-forth struggle. Neither side was able to gain a complete advantage. Our team missed many good free throw opportunities, and the team's luck was extremely poor, as the team members failed to score on many shots that they were very confident in making. Huang Tianxi, our team's 6-foot-3-inch guard, was ejected after committing four fouls, which greatly weakened the team's defense. The result of the first half was 18 to 19, with Chile in the lead. At the beginning of the second half, Chile immediately increased its score by six points, taking the lead for the first time. Cai Wenhua, the captain of our team, made two consecutive baskets in the middle of the field, making the team active again. Other points were scored by Bao Songyuan and Wu Chengzhang from free throws. Bao Songyuan was also ejected later due to committing four fouls. The main reasons for the team's failure were: (1) failure to score on free throws, (2) lack of shooters, and (3) weakened defense after two formal guards were ejected. Also, our team's second game is against the Belgian team.</p>
<h3>Li Shiqiao Did Not Arrive - Emotional Panic</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, July 31st broadcast: The Chinese basketball team's loss to Chile was mainly due to the fact that Li Shiqiao, the key to the forward score, failed to arrive. The guards being too quick to move far out, allowing the ball to fall into the hands of the enemy, and then being unable to return to rescue it, was also a reason for the setback. The strength of the two teams was about the same, so the battle was extremely tense. In the last few minutes of the game, the difference was still between half a point and one point. The Chinese team was eager to win, but missed several free throws, so Chile scored two consecutive goals, making it impossible to recover. The Chinese lineup at the beginning of the game was: Yu Ruizhang, Wu Chengzhang, Cai Wenhua, Bao Songyuan, Huang Tianxi.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, July 30th] The Chinese World Games basketball team played against Chile on the 30th. After a hard fight, the Chinese team lost 44 to 39. The scoring table is as follows:</p>

<h3>800 Meter Freestyle Swim - Yoshihashi Breaks World Record - 9 Minutes 45.2 Seconds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, July 31st] According to local reports, Japanese swimming god Yoshihashi Hiromi has set a new world record in the 800-meter freestyle.

<h3>Municipal Education Workers' Friendship Association Requests Continued Collection of Advanced Study Fees</h3>

<h3>School Introduction - Nanjing Jianguo College</h3>
<p>Nanjing Jianguo College of Law and Commerce was founded in the spring of the 36th year of the Republic by Zhang Ji, Chen Guofu, Xiao Zheng, Zhou Binglin, Zhao Jinhua and others. Currently, the college has six departments, including Law, Politics, Economics, Cooperation, Business Management, Accounting and Banking, and a Land Administration Research Institute. It also plans to add a College of Arts and Sciences and then change its name to "Jianguo University." The professors hired by the college are all experienced and reputable authoritative scholars in the country. President Xiao Zheng is an authority in the field of land administration in our country. He once served as a professor at National Chengchi University. Over the past 20 years, he has cultivated countless "land administration specialists," but he is still "not satisfied." Therefore, he contacted comrades and founded the college. Yang Youjiong, the director of academic affairs, is a jurist and famous professor who is not only famous in China, but also enjoys a high reputation around the world, and is recognized as one of the fourteen famous jurists in the world. Lin Bin, the director of the Department of Law, has served as a legislator in various sessions and participated in drafting hundreds of laws, such as the Constitution, Civil Law, and Criminal Law. He has successively taught at Peking University, National Central University, National Chengchi University, and Chaoyang University. He has now been nominated by the President to serve as a Justice of the Constitutional Court of the first session. Lou Tongsun, the director of the Department of Economics, has served as a professor at National Central University, the president of Zhejiang College of Law and Politics, a legislator, and the secretary-general of the Legislative Yuan. He is one of the leading economists in our country. Shou Miancheng, the director of the Department of Cooperation, is the leader of the cooperative sector in China today and currently serves as the general manager of the Central Cooperative Bank. Wu Chengluo, the director of the Department of Business Management, is a famous industrial scientist in the country. He has served as the director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Economy and the director of the Trademark Bureau, and is currently a technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Pan Xulun, the director of the Department of Accounting and Banking, is the most famous accounting expert in our country. In addition, most of the professors at the college are famous scholars and celebrities in the country, or even the world, such as Hu Ciwei, Dai Xiuzan, Mei Zhongxie, Xiao Gongzhao, Guan Jiyu, Zhang Pijie, Wu Shuting, Shen Shidi, Liu Keru, Du Guangxun, Dai Mingli, Gu Yuqiong, Ren Zhuoxuan (Ye Qing), etc.</p>
<p>At present, the college has nearly 1,000 teachers and students. This summer, it is recruiting 50 new freshmen in each department in Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 300 people, and a number of second-year transfer students. The recruitment is being held in both Beijing and Shanghai. The Shanghai area has been scheduled to register from July 29 to August 10, and the exams will be held on August 14 and 15.

<h3>The So-Called "Science"</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Yang Mei's "mystery" has been unraveled. Our country's scientists have researched for so many days, spent so much money, and finally proved a truth:</p>
<p>"You can't live without eating; it's impossible to not eat for nine years!"</p>
<p>I dare not say whether this conclusion is ironic or not, but I only feel that Chinese scientists are so lacking in confidence! The world has already reached the 1950s, and they still want to attach scientific basis to the allusions in the Five Elements Records. Is this the achievement of our fifty years of science? I really feel embarrassed for Mr. Science.</p>
<p>Science has its own scientific truth, and it does not allow any accidental matters to distort it, otherwise what kind of truth is it? The human body needs nutrition, and nutrition must be absorbed from food. Even plants and trees are no exception. This is common sense and cannot be considered a scientific invention or discovery. Our ancestors have said many times: "One day without food, you will be hungry; three days without food, you will be sick; seven days without food, you will die." Except for certain political hunger strikes, which can have the "miracle" of not eating for more than twenty days, there are very few exceptions. However, our scientists do not even have this basic belief, isn't it strange?</p>
<p>Reading Western history, there are stories of Copernicus and Galileo sacrificing their lives and freedom for the truth. Chinese people may think it's too foolish. As for Darwin, who dared to defy the world, even in the 1930s in the United States, there were lawsuits arising from the theory of evolution. The religious persecution Darwin suffered at that time is probably beyond our imagination. The reason they were so firm and not moved by the fallacies of the world was nothing more than their strong faith and recognition of the truth. Its essence is no different from the martyrdom spirit of religious figures. It's a pity that no one has written a book to depict the philosophers who sacrificed for the belief in truth, so that we can have more courage. However, even watching a movie like "Madame Curie" is enough to inspire a coward, isn't it?</p>
<p>China is a country where science is not developed. Although some national essence scholars loudly sing about how Mozi invented airplanes and the Book of Songs contains strange theories about the eight planets, and that the origins of all the world's scientific principles can be found in China, the facts are too far from it and can only serve as a Quixotic spiritual sustenance for a declining nation. However, our wise predecessors often gave us encouragement for the courage to recognize the truth. Mencius said: "If you reflect on yourself and find you are right, go forward even if there are thousands of people against you." He also said: "Wealth and rank cannot corrupt me, poverty and meanness cannot move me, and power and force cannot subdue me." These are all excellent teachings. It's just that we emphasize ethical codes, while the West emphasizes natural laws, and thus developed into two paradigms of philosophy and science.</p>
<p>Some people say that because there is no scientific system, philosophy is also fragmented and cannot form a system like Aristotle and Kant. This is also true. The main reason is that we pay too much attention to daily life and are not willing to engage in abstract thinking. This is also caused by climate, geography, and economic conditions, which cannot be helped. Confucius's "one thread of loyalty and forbearance" was interpreted by Mr. Zhang Taiyan as a learning method. Loyalty is being loyal to truth and knowledge, and forbearance is reasoning from the truth, so-called inferring three corners from one corner, like definitions and theorems in today's physics and geometry. Perhaps this is somewhat biased, but looking at the scholarly spirit of the Han scholars of the Qing Dynasty, we feel it is correct.</p>
<p>The polytheism and witchcraft of barbarian peoples are also called shamanism. Today, the indigenous people of Siberia and some ethnic minorities in the northeastern border regions of China still retain this custom, and it has even spread to the Yellow River basin. People dance with spirits, snakes, foxes, and rats are all objects of worship, and small temples of the "Great Immortal" are everywhere. Corresponding to this is divination, which is believed by more intellectuals. Although science has progressed, there are magnificent hospitals in big cities, and several departments of natural science and applied science have been established in universities, wandering doctors and shamans still dominate the folk. Big cities are also full of things like scientific fortune-telling, which is simply our shame. The initial motive of things like Yang Mei's matter is probably not different from the spirit dancing of female shamans. Unexpectedly, due to the belief of the ignorant people, it attracted the attention of the scientific community and spent a lot of money and time researching a phenomenon that is absolutely incompatible with science. At least I think this is a waste! Now that a flaw has finally been found, proving that people cannot survive without eating, if this flaw were never discovered, would the scientific community really be prepared to admit the principle that "you can still live without eating"? Science proves unscientific rumors, and shamanism has a basis for everything. I dare not imagine what attitude the public will take towards Mr. Science!</p>
<p>Not only does the material construction of science need to be worked on, but the spiritual construction of science also needs to be worked on! Please don't let the smog blind your eyes again, and you will be fortunate!</p>
<h3>Foreign Unicorns</h3>
<p>— Nan Wu</p>
<p>In Europe in the sixteenth century, the practice of poisoning enemies was very popular. For a time, wealthy families all rushed to buy unicorn horn cups, because they believed that unicorn horns had the effect of detoxification. But unicorns were originally just legendary things, so what they bought were actually cups made of ivory. In 1553, King Henry II of France paid a huge price for a unicorn horn cup, which would be worth as much as 100,000 US dollars today. According to Western legends, unicorns are shaped like horses, with heads like goats, with hooves, and a horn that extends diagonally forward from the forehead. This horn is extremely long, reaching four or five feet. Also, unicorns in murals from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are mostly white, looking very docile, but there are also pictures of them stabbing people with that long horn.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaobai's Literary Works</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Revolutionary veteran Chen Shaobai studied for the imperial examinations in his hometown in his youth. He was intelligent and capable of writing (see Zhong Rongguang's "Biography of Mr. Chen Shaobai"). He was handsome, quick-witted, and proficient in poetry, lyrics, songs, fu, qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting. He was known as a romantic talent. In the early days of the Xingzhonghui, there was a lack of writers, and most of the proclamations were written by Shaobai (see Feng Ziyou's "Chen Shaobai's Literary Works"). Chen's management of the China Daily was incisive and unique for a time. Nine years before the Republic of China, the Protect the Emperor Party published the Commercial Daily in Hong Kong, with Xu Qin, a student of Kang Youwei, as the president. Chen and Xu engaged in a war of words in more than ten continued drafts, marking the beginning of political debates in the mainland.</p>
<p>Tao Mo, the Governor-General of Liangguang, admired the new learning and read the China Daily every day. He often used the comments in the China Daily as a standard for promoting and demoting officials. At the end of the Guangxu reign, Cen Chunxuan, the Governor-General of Liangguang, announced that the Yuehan Railway would be taken over by the government. The shareholders of the Yue Railway unanimously resisted. Cen arrested the gentry, including Wang Guolian, and started the railway administration turmoil. Shareholders in Hong Kong organized the "Yue Railway Shareholders' Association for the Protection of Railway Rights" to resist the Qing government. The texts and all plans issued by this association were presided over by Chen. The gentlemen of Hong Kong usually admired Chen's profound and fluent articles, so they specially hired him as a consultant.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Founding Father was enshrined in Nanjing, and he went to Nanjing to participate. He lived in the Dongya Hotel in Shanghai beforehand, and we often had the opportunity to chat. One day, he showed me the elegiac couplet he had written for the Founding Father. The couplet said: "One failure is it indeed! To practice the Way for a hundred years, abandoning the small for the large, striving for Great Harmony, even in hardship, even in dying, never slacking off. His influence is now gone! Entering the world for thirty years, driving the heroes, attracting many talents, who can be called a true confidant, a true comrade?" The inscription on the upper part was "Eternal Remembrance to Brother Yixian," and the inscription on the lower part was "Chen Shaobai Pays Respects." Chen and the Founding Father were classmates at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, and the two had sworn brotherhood. Among the Founding Father's comrades, only Chen was called brother, so Chen also directly called the Founding Father brother. (In fact, the Founding Father was three years older than Chen.)</p>
<p>Chen admired his fellow villager, Chen Baisha (Xianzhang), so he changed his name to Bai, with the style name Shaobai (his original name was Wen Shao, with the pseudonym Qiu Shi). He once wrote a couplet for the South Gate of his hometown, Xinhui: "The unparalleled scholar of Lingnan Neo-Confucianism, the first city of mountains and rivers within the territory." This can also be seen as his ambition to emulate the virtues of his predecessors. The essay is too long to excerpt. Now I excerpt a few of his poems to illustrate the rest. Visiting Su Zheng in Xianyang: "Living in Huaqing for just three springs, endless beauty to explore at will. If you want to know where the hero sleeps, north of Mount Li and south of the Wei River." "A solitary tomb of hundreds of feet is built of earth, the six kings are scattered and the strife is over. Now that there are no gateways in the southeast, one should remember the ten thousand li city for planning the borders." A poem for the pipa presented to the oriental hero Miyazaki Torazo: "A woman adrift in Xunyang, her icy strings tell of parting. A beggar from Wu, also makes the sound of the Dongxiao flute. Heroes wander and beauties grow old, sharing the remaining feelings and entrusting them to the autumn grass. I give you the pipa to accompany you on your travels, plucking for ten years in a long, desolate state." Feeling from a visit to Zhangjiakou: "The Great Wall has no end, rising from the ground and towering into the sky, it is difficult to scale. The wind and sand outside the fortress make the sky seem to change, and the autumn rain makes dreams cold. The market in the sun is not for the Hu horses, and the people I meet in my travels are all wearing Han crowns. The two forts have been at peace for three hundred years, just teach them to protect each other and not kill each other."</p>
<h3>Hungarian Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>Hungary is an ancient country in Central Europe, and it still retains many customs of the past. For example, when an unmarried girl carries a bucket of breakfast to a farmer working in the field, she also gives him a pot of flowers and fruits. If he is happy to accept it and returns a bag of sugar to her, it is considered a formal engagement. Nine out of ten Hungarian women are named Ilona. They can enjoy voting rights in politics, but only if they are over thirty years old, have at least three daughters, have received a university education, have the ability to make a living, or are married to husbands who have received a high school education.</p>
<p>Hungarians love to eat paprika and must have it with every meal. Farmers carry a large amount of powder in their wallets. When they eat corn, they eat the husks and tassels together, which Europeans often laugh at. Lake Balaton in the country is the largest freshwater lake in Central Europe, and it is famous for its unique species of blue-tailed fish, which are made into delicious fish soups.</p>
<p>The capital of Hungary is Budapest, which is actually a combination of Buda and Pest. It is divided into two districts by the Danube River, with bridges connecting them. Buda is older, while Pest is more modern. It is a popular place for boating and sailing, and water races are also very famous.</p>
<p>The Hungarian race is very complex, including Magyars, Germans, Jews, Serbs, Bosnians, Slovaks, etc. Among them, the Magyars are the most powerful, accounting for 93% of the total population, and they often discriminate against other races.</p>
<h3>Ascent</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Built with earth and stone, with pavilions and towers on top, to enjoy the pleasure of distant views. Yuan Jie's "Preface to the Terrace Inscription" says, "In ancient times, there were those who harbored anger and were sick of the customs of the time. Unable to build high terraces to look around, they would climb to the peaks of mountains and the shores of the sea, stretching their necks and singing to express themselves." This so-called terrace is actually a steep stone, eighty or ninety feet high. The inscription says, "The Xiang River is clear and deep, the terrace is steep and precipitous. Climbing and looking far, nothing is out of sight. Who is tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, trapped in a narrow space? Lend me this terrace, to indulge my mind and eyes." Reading this, I realize the wonderful use of ascending and looking afar. Mingling in the streets, one forgets one's cramped situation for a long time. Today there are skyscrapers, whose tops can be climbed, and people below look like insects. However, foreigners commit suicide by jumping from them. If these people could taste Yuan Jie's words, to express themselves, why couldn't they change their thoughts of厭世 with a long-term perspective? Some say that those who climb high look up at the sky and look down at the dust and filth, which will only increase their anger and disgust. This is indeed the case, but only for those who have not seen the Way. If one cherishes the solemnity of hell, and would give one's brain marrow, then one would wish to transform into billions of bodies, to be a marshal and a torch, to bear the heavy burden of the masses, why would one need to climb to express oneself?</p>
<h3>Huang Binhong's Couplet for Gao Chuiwan</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Binhong, the libationer of the National Academy of Painting, is eighty-five years old. He has been living in Beiping in recent years, and in addition to painting and calligraphy, he has been writing constantly. Recently, he flew from Beiping to Shanghai. The calligraphers of Shanghai held a gathering at the Daguan Society to welcome him, which was extremely grand. The following is a congratulatory couplet written by the elderly Bin for Mr. Gao Chuiwan of Jinshan on his 70th birthday last year.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The farce of Shanghai demolishing stone figures and the mob of ignorant people rioting can be described as in full swing. Looking at the state of the stone figures being pulled and lifted in the copperplate print, their embarrassment and ridiculousness are more than the soap king in the play "Splitting the Soap Family." There are many stone figures in the old capital, and the atmosphere is slower to open up than in Jiangnan, but I have never seen such a bustling scene.</p>
<p>The stone figures in the suburbs of the old capital are due to the tombs of princes, nobles, and high-ranking ministers, which are allowed to be erected, with the amount depending on the rank and status. (Commonly called stone men and stone horses. Stone men include both civil and military officials. Stone horses include various types of horses.) The stone men often have incomplete parts, or half a body, or just a head, and are used for appreciating antiques along with wooden and clay figures. Stone horses, stone unicorns, lions, and elephants are mostly small, displayed on the side steps of shop doors. Because they are heavy, there is no fear of theft, and they are also advertisements for unique products. Passersby who stop to admire them will have a widespread impression of the antiques and antiques inside the shop. They are especially attractive to foreigners. In the past, "foreign shops" had very good sales. However, since the Republic of China, the Manchu nobles have become increasingly impoverished. These items have no practical use, and there are many sellers. However, genuine items are mostly large, and it is not easy to move and sell them. Small items are also rare, but they can be imitated. Some who are good at making foreign money order stone masons to imitate their shape and reduce their volume, like models.</p>
<p>In the past, there were many foreigners in Dongjiaomin Lane, and foreign shops flourished. At that time, foreigners liked to collect Buddhist statues, deity statues, and Dharma instruments and utensils. The old capital was originally the capital of the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, and the number of temples was more than the "four hundred and eighty temples of the Southern Dynasties." There were more than 370 named ones inside and outside the nine cities, and the small nunneries and temples in the streets and alleys were countless. Due to the changes of the times, incense was sparse. Except for the particularly famous large temples, most of the idols and offerings in them were colluded by the abbots and merchants, and transferred to foreigners through antique dealers. The houses of small temples were rented out to civilians and became courtyards. Only two or three out of ten of the halls remained, barely maintaining the facade, and the rest disappeared. The idols and Buddhist instruments of the small temples were convenient to display and transport, and their craftsmanship was extremely exquisite (because the small size made it easier to construct), and they were truly the highest art. Chinese people, except for those who believed in them and took them home for worship, were afraid of desecration and were unwilling to buy them easily. Foreigners collected everything. Therefore, in the backyards of various antique shops, large and small god and Buddha statues and utensils of all kinds were prepared, as if one were in an ancient temple. This was the situation before the twentieth year of the Republic of China. In the past ten years, there have been fewer foreigners, the "foreign shops" have "withered," and the inventory of temples has become increasingly scarce. Seven or eight out of ten antique dealers have closed down, and everything has become a fleeting cloud. The other day, I visited a temple fair and saw an old monk setting up a stall, dumping his old cassock, and incomplete scriptures, wooden fish, rosary beads, etc., to earn money for his meals. This reflects the increasingly difficult life in general, especially for temples. Nowadays, bereaved families rarely have the money to do Buddhist services, and monks rely on "socializing" (i.e., chanting sutras) as a major source of income, and new-style economic funerals are popular, so few people inquire about Buddhist services. Recalling the old Qing Dynasty, "monks in the capital, officials outside," it seems like a different world. In the past, officials in Beijing were mostly poor and had no retinues, while officials outside the capital are now mostly respected and wealthy. However, the monks of the major temples in Beijing have a lot of interactions with the nobles, dignitaries, celebrities, and gentry of the inner court, banquets, and socializing, and have a great deal of activity. The temple properties and income are abundant and prosperous, and ordinary Buddhist services have become secondary. Therefore, people at that time thought that it was better to be an official outside the capital and a monk in the capital.</p>
<p>During the period of the occupation, the Japanese army searched and hoarded supplies for their military needs. Rice, in particular, almost became the exclusive property of the Japanese and a small number of senior puppet officials. The prices of other grains were high and scarce. There were many monks in the major temples, and it was truly a case of "too many monks and not enough porridge." The supply was not sustained. Therefore, a famous temple in the western city carried out a large "begging for alms" parade. The streets were filled with teams of monks, which the Chinese people were surprised to see, as they had never seen this before. However, in India and other places, this is a common occurrence. The so-called "begging for alms from door to door," with each household respectfully offering rice porridge. China is not a purely Buddhist country, so although they "beg for alms," it is not convenient to go "from door to door." It is only a sign of famine.</p>
