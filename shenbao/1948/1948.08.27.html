<p>專論</p>
<h3>孔子人生哲學的體認　——紀念教師節——</h3>
<p>孔子是我國古代的大教育家，我們今天紀念至聖先師孔子，首須認識他在教育事業上的成就及其學術上的造詣。但是一個人教育的論的確定，又往往根據其人生哲學。所以我們要瞭解孔子的教育目的論，更非首先對孔子的人生哲學諸觀點，加以論究不可。</p>
<p>孔子生當亂世，外則夷狄强惡，諸夏屈辱，內而刺綱不振，戰亂頻仍，橫征暴斂，民不聊生。於是孔子本着悲天憫人的心理，發為救世救人的宏願，苦心孤詣的在探討實踐道　的原理及方法，用以修己安人。孔子所謂：「參乎！吾道一以貫之」。這「一貫之道」，便是孔子所發明的修己安人的根本原理，亦就是實踐道德的最高原理。這不僅是孔子獨創的思想，而且也是孔子學說的核心。所謂『一貫之道』者，就是仁；仁就是人的本性，亦就是人道。換言之，就是人對人的關係，及人與人間共同的理性。孔子說：『仁者，人也』。這便是說，仁是以人爲對象，不是孤立的；行仁的目的，即在推己及人，爲人服務。所謂仁者愛人，就是仁的具體的解說。以愛人爲仁，所以仁不僅是修身之德所能盡，必由修身而齊家而治國而平天下，達到理想的大同世界——仁的世界，然後仁德可虎完成。二是始於修己，而終於安人。孔子說：「君子無終食之間違仁，造次必於是，顚沛必於是」。其意即在於此。</p>
<p>孔子之道，以求「仁」的實現為唯一主義。其言忠言恕，即為進於仁的方法。正如曾子所說：「夫子之道，忠恕而已矣」。忠是修己的手段；欲求修己，必先盡己。「盡己之爲忠」；所謂盡己，首須在自己行爲的動機加以注意與修養，這便是克己的工夫。就是要對任何不正當的誘惑，都能絕對加以排斥，甚至爲求仁的實現，自己犧牲性命，亦所不惜。「志士仁人，無求生以害仁，有殺身以成仁」。殺身成仁，只有具有「忠』的精神才能做到；能忠，自能辨別是非，亦自能　善固執。其次，我們雖有了正正當當行爲的動機，但是仍然不敢擔保行動的結果一定亦是滿意的，善良的，所以還須對行爲的結果有所把握。這就所謂復禮的工夫。復禮又包括博文與約禮二義：博文是指求得知識作爲實踐的準備，約禮是行爲的練習，以往古聖哲所制定的禮儀爲規範，來約束自己的行爲。因爲求得的知識未必即能有裨於個人行爲的改善，必須遵循禮儀的拘束，加以鍜鍊，行爲的結果方才有可靠的把握。</p>
<p>恕，是安人的手段；欲求安人，必先推己。推己包括積極與消極兩方面的意義：「己之所欲，施之於人」；「己所不欲，勿施於人」。而其實際施行的途徑，則在政治與教育二者。第一，在政治方面：孔子主張首先要從正名着手。在其以爲如果要「撥亂世而反之正」，則必須用正名的手段，實行褒善貶惡，以示勸懲，才能使亂臣賊子知所儆戄，國家紀綱樹立起來。所以孔子修春秋，筆伐心誅，其目的即在使邪正善惡不致混淆。至其政治理想，則在求德治主義的實現。所謂德治主義，可從孔子所說「修己以敬」，「修己以安人」，及「子率以正，孰敢不正」，「其身正，不令而行；其身不正，雖令不從」，「通之以德，齊之以禮，有恥且格」，這些話加以解釋。就是說，依據仁德施政，則國家自可大治。其次，在教育方面，孔子主張要養成「人」，養成爲國家服務的人，亦就是所謂「仁者」。其教育方法，完全是其自己修己的手段，將自己修己的方法，誠實吿訴他人，所謂「己欲立而立人，己欲達而達人」是也。具體言之，就是說，要將仁加以實現，而成爲自我的人格時，不但自己究成的人格能感動他人，而且旣經完成自我的人格，一定更想進而將他人的人格加以究成。易言之，忠者始能恕，而恕者始能忠。反之，不忠，旣不能成己達己，焉能成人達人？不恕，則不能成人達人，又安能成己達己？因此之故，孔子才有「學而不厭」，「溫故而知新」的自己教育自己的態度，才能發出「有教無類」，「誨人不倦」，「循循善誘」的熱誠與興趣。</p>
<p>孔子對人生態度方面獨到的見解，距今雖已有二千餘年之久，但仍不失爲確當不易之論。其在哲學上教育上的價値，絲毫無所變更，足資百代景崇萬世鑽仰。所以政府規定孔子誕辰爲教師節，就是要將全國教師都看成孔子的化身，將實現孔子主張的責任完全付托在教師身上，其意義極爲重大。我們在今日舉行教師節的紀念，似乎不僅在求教師的地位待遇與進修等問題的解決，而且在能體認孔子的人生哲學，以謀氣質的變化。易言之，即所謂「改變人生」是也。我們認爲在這人心險惡，人欲橫流的今日，要想用教育力量來挽救時艱，振作人心，第一須有『以天下爲己任」的志願；第二須有「擇善固執」的態度，才可無往而不可。</p>
<p>孔子周遊列國，不憚煩勞，雖爲悲天憫人之念所激發，但其要乃在「以天下爲己任」之志明示百世。徵生畝曾問孔子：「子何爲是栖栖者與？無乃爲佞乎？」，孔子說：「非敢爲佞也，疾固也。」孔子的栖栖皇皇，其志即在救世安人。又如長沮桀溺對子路的話說：「滔滔者，天下皆是也，而誰以易之？」孔子回答說：「鳥獸不可與同羣，吾非斯人之徒與，而誰與？」悲觀的厭世主義者，天下有道則見，無道則隱，祗會搶便宜，喫現成飯，改造社會的事，他們不願多管，所以「仁義充塞，率獸食人，人將相食」的萬惡社會，在他們視若無覩，一走了事，與木石居，與鹿豕遊，反自鳴淸高。孔子却痌　在抱，於心不忍，而終不肯以自逸輕卸其責。我們　目時艱，尤須學此「盡己」的精神，努力推進教育工作，決不要精神懈弛，祗用「困難」與「棘手」一類話頭來委卸責任，或拿「高蹈遠行」的美名來遮飾過失。我們要認定教育是有教無類的，社會上有一人未受教育感化，總是我們責任未盡，志願未達。</p>
<p>孔子抱救世安人的宏願，一生奔馳，艱苦備嘗，受厄於陳蔡，見議於鄭衛，雖其道終不行，但其「授善固執」的態度，「知其不可爲而爲之」的精神，實在偉大。孔子是堅信正義必可得到最後勝利，很肯定的說：「天生德於予，桓　如予何！」這種凜然不可侵犯的氣槪，足以克服一切困難，不問收穫，但事耕耘。正如子路所說：「君子之仕也行其義也，道之不行，吾知之矣；」董仲舒所說：「正其誼不謀其利，明其道不計其功。」今天我國教育界中學養有根基而志趣遠大者，雖不乏其人，但亦不免囿於一般功利主義的認見，對教　則抱鋅點主義，做工作則崇尙表面，且常感犧牲而無代價，甚至遇事之有利於己者，趨之若驚，反之，則避之惟恐不及。固然，無目標而作散漫的努力，或屈己徇人，而妄冀專功有所成就，都不應該，但偏執潔身自愛之見，而規避責任，廢弛職守，亦非教師所應有的態度。</p>
<p>孔門的哲學最有系統的說明，是「大學」一書。大學開端便提出三大綱領：「大學之道，在明明德，在新民，在止於至善。」所謂「在明明德」，就是不要使生下來的德性汨沒，而自己要知道去砥礪它，光大會，可以說就是要確定我們的人生觀，。所謂「在新民」，就是要喚起民衆，教化民衆，使民衆的生活都能向上。所謂「止於至善」，就是要使自己和他人的一切行動都一定要到最好的極點爲止。在今日言之，我們生當這艱鉅時代，只有對人生有深切體會，才能切實了解教育的價値。我們必須爲「仁者愛人」的心理所驅使，負起教育建國的使命。這樣，才可談到教育的力量，亦只有這樣，才不辜負今天教師節的熱烈紀念！</p>
<h3>七五案調查竣事　監院提出糾舉書　認陳繼承趙昌言白世維措置失當</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕監委谷　翔，胡文暉二氏，前奉派於本月三日飛平調查七五事件眞相，業於二十日調查竣事。二氏在平時隊搜集有關資料外，並曾詢問在塲有關人員，訪問當時在東交民巷中外人士，並赴塲地勘查，根據所得結果，製成報吿書，全文長四千餘字。分「肇事原因及事實經過」與「七五事件之分析」二部份。同時對措置失當之北平警備司令陳繼承，靑年軍第二〇八師搜索營營長趙昌言，曁平市警局副局長白世維等，提出糾舉。該項報吿書及糾舉書，巳由胡文暉於廿三日返京時提出於監察院。監院並已於今發表糾舉案，亦經監委唐鴻烈，金越克及陳瑀山三氏審查成立，於廿五日由監院送行政院，該糾舉書對陳繼承，趙昌言，白世維係分三部份提出；（一）陳繼承部份略稱：當七月五日學生請願遊行時，陳繼承未照傅總司令指示命令其部屬不准帶槍，不許打學生。而二〇八師爲一野戰部隊，以之鎭壓學生，更不免發生事端。且二〇八師與北平學生情感素劣，陳繼承於處理此事時未能考慮及此。學生搗毀參議會固屬越軌犯紀，陳繼承於學生軍警對峙竟日之時，未能躬親妥善戒護，而令一警官身份之白世維指揮軍警憲，自不能善爲約束所部，卒致在許惠東住宅門前發生學生被二〇八師士兵槍擊傷亡慘案。陳繼承不能不負措施不當，廢弛職務之責。（二）趙昌言部份略稱：當七月五日下午學生在許惠東住宅門前請願，未克獲見許惠東時，趙昌言奉命率部到塲戒護，而由警局副局長白世維任指揮官，趙昌言未能聽從白世維命令，縱其部屬作戰鬥措施，士兵開槍又不立即制止，致釀成慘案，趙昌言應負縱屬殺人之責，交軍法審判科以罪責。（三）白世維部份略稱：白世維以警察局副局長地位，奉命爲指揮官，未能與軍憲聯絡得宜，旣見部隊出動態勢嚴重，應即約束部屬與學生接受處置條件。後又未能及時將學生即將解散歸去之消息通知都隊，致因誤會發生慘案。白世維不無處理疏忽，指揮無方，失職之處。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州廿六日電〕新幣發行後，此間兌換之踴躍，巳足見新幣之信用及受擁護之程度。惟日來仍有少數投機份子，乘新輔幣未到之際，私自買賣外幣圖利，警局特連日出動大隊員警監視，昨在十三行金融市塲捕獲十餘名。十三行巳一片蕭條，無復昔日盛况。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林廿六日電〕柏林市參議會在共黨公然宣佈推翻民選市政府而在全城各州集中後，即取消廿六日下午之會議。市參議會原定於下午二時在蘇佔區市政府集會，然未及中午，集中之共黨員已向市政廳出發，市參議會元老委員會乃於中午表決取消會議。恩奇丹美蘇區交界處，美區　警察與　　之共產暴民一百五十人幾至發生衡突·西方區全體警察廿六日晨即已奉命設備，蓋其時共黨之意向已照然若揭。故恩奇丹形勢緊張時，十隊警察即開往增援。羣衆手持共產旗幟，口唱國際歌，高呼：「美國資本主義者滾開！這裏不是美國，是蘇聯區城。你們炸毀我們的房屋，　殺我們的婦孺，現在又不給貪物我們吃，滾開！」示威羣衆於淸晨即在蘇區之邦得烈　公園集中，雖西方佔區監察業巳全體出動，然仍不能保護市政憲，蓋市政廳適位於蘇區內四強　定之「中立地區」。據　　警長稱，彼等奉命如暴衆侵入美區，即加以擊退。凱高中校稱，除非高級美當局特領命令，美憲兵決不派往邊界。市政會議程上計有高度爆裂性之　案四件，其中任何一件均可資爲共黨推翻民選政府之藉口。美方報紙稱，「如共黨企圖以大規模的示威　奪政綱，則必獲得報應，自食其國」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿六日電〕柏林之民選市政府在共產示威者之滋擾打擊下，廿六日似有崩潰之處，共黨在大批行動委員會份子，黨方工作人員，工廠工人及新蘇派人士之支持下，自行舉行市政會議。僉認此為蘇方自行成立柏林政府之第一批惡浪。三大非共正常立即號召黨員，在下午三時舉行民衆抗議大會，以聯合力量應付共黨反對政府之攻勢。大會係在蘇區外一箭之遙前德國會大廈前之共和國廣場舉行。德共柏林偽市議會設立一十人委會，並通過一紙要求，將提交代理市長費利登斯堡，要求中包括「在共黨控制下之全市統一政府」等。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿六日電〕此間消息靈通人十對於此次合義重大之柏林共黨示威遊行，頗為恐懼，渠等認為此舉，可能引起共黨進而索取柏林市政府之政權。共黨領袖皮克今晨在該黨舉行會議時宣稱，「吾人係為民族的及社會主義的目的而奮鬥，蘇聯佔領軍黨局將支持吾人。吾人在柏林之奮鬥，係為保證柏林之貨幣統一及接濟品統一而奮鬥。」</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕此間外交界指出目前莫斯科會議之重要關鐘，在於（一）德國未來之政體應爲分治，抑或統一（二）共產思想是否應許其回西歐蔓延直達法國邊境，抑或應封閉於目前之地械。英斯科會談自七月底開始，至今仍停留於第一階段，目的在商討如何召開四國外長會議，決定德國最後之政體。談判之基次條件之一，爲如何取得德國幣制協議。此外史達林更要求在重開四外長會議時，應中止倫敦協議中所規定之重組西德各邦及由西方列强建立西德政府，因蘇聯認爲新成立之西德政府，乃一種軍事基地，終將成爲攻繫蘇聯之跳板。對西方盟國而言，目前停止西德政府之組織，當無問題，藍未來之外長會議原將討論整個德國之政體問題，然如果德國之統一政府成立，即使爲一聯邦政府，則必以柏林爲首都。</p>

<h3>收兌金銀外幣數字　昨日突破過去紀錄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日收兌金鈔白銀之總値，高達一〇，二三一，三〇四。五七金圓券，以一萬五千金圓之差額，打破前日之紀錄。內中黃金爲三二，五八五·五四六兩，美金七八七，四九八·二八元，白銀二五，一一六·九九〇兩，銀元八六，二六三枚，港幣四二一，七六七·〇五元。與第二日比較，收進美鈔之數字略减，但黃金及銀元有顯著增加。今日爲孔誕，行莊休假，收兌工作亦停止一天。</p>

<h3>蔣夫人縱橫談　「兒童樂園」中招待記者　縱牯嶺建設說到幣制改革</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　劉同渠</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿四日航訊」牯嶺連朝陰雨，大霧迷漫，總統下山後第二天，天氣便變壞了，一連就是六天。廿四日下午，雨止霧散，天空上浮雲流動，陽光時隱時現，被霧窒息的人們，這時總算透一口氣。</p>
<p>雨天，牯嶺是無聊的，新聞記渚沒有可採訪的對象，便挖空了心思打主意。先托管理局長王作民向總統夫人說，能不能找個時間招待一次記者，隨便談談，後來沒有下文。廿四日中午，一封連名的請求信送到官邸。</p>
<p>在街上，記者們正在閒蕩，覓取採訪的對象，夫人徐步走來了，肩興和侍從都隨在後邊。碰見了記者羣，夫人馬上想起　　公案，對王作民說：「好不好請他們一同去看看兒童樂園，同時一槐談談？</p>
<p>這變成了偶然的機會，在兒童樂園中，一個簡單的記者招待會舉行了——這是總統夫人第一次招待記者呢。</p>
<p>夫人愛護女孤兒　妙語引得哄堂笑</p>
<p>十四個無父母的女孤兒在胡院長的敎養下長大起來了，她們更得到總統夫人的偏愛。夫人自己說，侮次到牯嶺來，不是請她們到官邸去玩，便是來看她們。今年，她仍親身來了，捐了五石米，帶了許多點心，讓她們唱了一個歌後，把水菓蛋糕親手分給她們吃，用這空隙，夫人接見了記者羣。</p>
<p>大衣和頭紗都沒有脫掉，夫人安詳地坐在室角一隻籐紗發喪，安詳地面對這一羣記者：「你們有什麼要問的？」　話從孤兒們身上談起來。夫人說：「她們都是女孩子，被父母拋棄了，可見社會上重男輕女。」一個記者馬上接起來：「她們已得到夫人的愛護，却又是東女輕男」一陣哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>談到在牯嶺，這幾天雨霧不停，夫人也很少出來。她說「我是準備下山去了。」「總統不來了吧。」「他太忙，恐怕不能來。」南京黃埔路官邸還在修葺，夫人說：「回京後恐仍是住在北極閣宋公館。」記者問：「夫人對牯嶺建設的印象怎麼樣？」「看起來，街道是很淸潔的。建設要靠大家帮忙，只靠一個局長是不行的，尤其是你們新聞記者，要多多協助。」</p>
<p>坐在地板上吃水菓蛋糕的小朋友們，在望着這一羣奇怪的客人。夫人回過頭來：「你們唱一個歌給客人聽好不好？」於是胡院長奏風琴，她們合唱了一個歌。夫人又親自把糕餅盤子交給最大的孩子，讓她領大家出去玩。</p>
<p>不全力支持新幣　吃苦的還是人民招待會還繼續着。問題却轉而嚴　了。記渚問：「幣制改革後，經濟會安定下來，軍事上無問題，總統和夫人是不是有意到國外走一走？」這問題似乎使夫人有點爲難，她略猶豫了一下，說：「我不知道，我不能答復這問題。」</p>
<p>倒是幣制改革的問題，引起夫人的意見。她說：「幣制改革後經濟是否安定，要看人民是否有信心，一心一德來支持。她指出抗戰八年終於打敗日本，就是由於全國人民一致。如果人民無信心，不全力支持新幣制，到後來吃苦的還是人民自已。」</p>
<p>力取實不如說服　勸導富戶快捐輸</p>
<p>夫人有很多英美友人，對於歐美輿論特別注意，記者們便以此爲題，向夫人請敎。夫人說：民主是可以容忍批評的。不過，民主不是把外國東西搬到中國來，中國有中國的民主。對於美援，夫人認爲不能完全靠友邦援助，要自力更生。有一位記者提出「豪門資本」的問題，夫人似乎有些激動，說：「豪門資本是共產黨喊出來的口號。「她認爲要富人拿出錢來，可以由政府規定很重的稅，但不能「敲竹槓。」「如果不敲不拿出來呢？」夫人的看法是：人都是有良心的，力取不如勸服，她相信只要勸導有方，一定可以使有錢人感動，拿出錢來。接着，由婦女運動談到農民問題，夫人說明全國婦女運動委員會自抗戰以來，始終未停止工作，不過多作實際，少作宣傳。今後，也應彌補這一缺陷，在宣傳方面下點工夫。問題在經費少，婦運會也是社會團體，沒有固定經費，听以辦事很困難。她主張今後一切工作都要下鄉，農民出錢出力，應該改善他們的生活。夫人說，學生尤其應該下鄕。</p>
<p>對記者們的印象　認爲是國家先驅</p>
<p>問題再轉，談到新聞記渚本身來了。「夫人對新聞記者的印象如何？是不是抗戰後記者們有了進步？」</p>
<p>「很明顯，」夫人肯定地說：「如果不是認爲你們記者是有爲的靑年，我今天也不曾花這些時閒和你們談話了。」她說，她也作過新聞記者。她認爲新聞託者是國家的先驅，要記載確實，注重大事，不要過於注意小節。在社會上起領導作用，尤其要以身作則，注意言行。</p>
<p>談話大約進行了四十分鐘，夫人始終是安詳地對答，能度和靄，微笑始終未離開唇邊，給人以十分親切的印象。她在記者們的謝謝聲中立起來，和記者們逐一握手，告辭出去了。</p>
<p>歸金，夫人仍是步行。我們的攝影記者趕了來，電光一閃，夫人的笑容收進鏡頭。夫人看，原來是熟識的攝影記者：</p>
<p>「你還在——」</p>
<p>「我現在申報。」</p>
<p>「申報，」夫人微笑着點頭。暮　展開，濃霧又從山頭撲下去，一直送夫人走回河東路官邸。</p>

<h3>證交經紀人公會開會　決定停止代客買賣　希望主管當局早日准予復業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市證劵交易所經紀人公會於昨日下午三時起，召開臨時會員大會，出席會員代表共一百九十餘人，由理事長王乃徐主席，討論至四時卅分散會。甫要決議案兩起：（一）證交奉令停業期間，全體經紀人慼停止代客買賣交易。俟證交復業後，再行恢復買賣。（二）請證交當局，上呈政府主管當局，從速恢復證交營業。</p>
<p>經紀人公會理事長王乃徐，於會後向記者發表談話稱：經紀人本身立埸，素向純潔。政府歷次經濟新措施，經紀人無不恪遵法令，協助政府推行經濟施策。例如上次遞交暫停，經紀人即遵令將已做交易順利交割淸楚。此次證交奉令停業前，經紀人對各項交易之存賬額達一百萬億元，惟亦吿順利交割淸楚，可見經紀人始終與政府合作。故此次政府頒佈證交停業令後，公會立塲，除一方面請谷經紀人一律暫停代客買賣交易外，一方面固仍望政府能從速恢復證交營業。</p>
<p>幣制穩定後，對市塲游資，應有適當之疏導，俾納諸正軌。證交停業後，經紀人二百十三家，從業人員直接簡接相關者亦達數十萬人，均頗受影響，而一般工廠公司，資金亦無法融通。相信證交復業後，當能爲市塲游資作成橋樑，使走向生產之途徑云。</p>
<h3>產地價平銷路呆滯　食米低檔盤旋　油市禁運出口人心虛輭</h3>
<p>米市疲檔徘徊，原因爲銷路呆滯，天氣晴朗，到貨絡繹，新秈米登塲日多，產地價格平穩，進戶胃懈，走銷甚緩，初市價格彷彿，後見跌落二角至五角，南市白粳退入十九元內，薄稻退站二十元，惟至收市略見轉堅。北市塲薄稻均平，特高粳銷淡，下挫五角，以二十一元成交。今日孔誕日停市一天，昨日到貨三九四〇石。</p>
<p>麺粉　因廠方仍未開出，市上存貨日减，執貨者乘缺貨之機會，再報高價格，昨日開市尚平，後市銷活價挺。老重初開為七元四角，收市昂達七元四角五分，兵船由七元一角二分升至七元二角，前者升一角，後者挺五分。紅峰·建成·上漲一角及一角二分，雜牌粉有微昂五分者，亦有平定者。麩皮交易甚少，價鮮上落。</p>
<p>雜糧　平穩，大都仍根據限價交易，黃豆因禁止出口，人心轉疲，供樣稍增，但價格仍站原盤。漢口乍豆中貸開十元，杜豆較堅。苞米靑島帮添辦如常，價格平定。元麥祗汕頭一帮納取，價削七角至一元。蠶豆本街零化，價格加二角。豌豆平靜，芝蔴雖已禁止出口，但本街去化尙佳，價能站定。生仁廣帮需要，仍以限價交易。</p>
<p>食油　因禁止出口及限制轉口，故人心看低，進戶吃價甚低，但因存貨不豐，現豆價不廉，貨主心思不軟，故雖見稍降，疲中帶定。大有豆油以五十一元成交，其餘爲五十元，略降五角至一元五角。生油因上日價格過高，挫落二元。吉桶生油直至收市始以六十二元開出，生菜油低五角至一元，獨小車藤油客帮有辦，升一元。豆餅汕頭帮見低納取，續昂一角至二角。</p>

<h3>茶市銷路呆滯</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，自日前透露曙光後，終因賣戶堅售如故，而輸出商需求並不迫切，致過程仍不活潑。價格方面，則依然一穩定，缺乏軒輊。頃聞新華，午昌，等茶葉公司，對於路莊溫州珍眉，均會電海外兜攬生意，惟能否獲得順利，尙在醞釀中。至於內銷茶，本街店莊鑒於存貨尙形充沛，又以執貨者猶豫，致目前無意添納，市面成帶岑靜。</p>
<h3>今日孔誕紀念　市塲一致休業</h3>

<h3>本週出口結匯　數字較前减少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本週出口貨品甲請結匯數字，上海一埠折合美金二，四〇一，七八四·六三美元，不及上週之半，其原因在於本週五起，各銀行均奉令停業，辦理幣制改革整理賬戶之故。</p>
<p>此項結匯總數中，包括政府管制扶助下，輸出之紗布礦砂等項美金八三八，六七七，九九元，如以商品種類分，則爲：豬鬃二五〇，〇三九·四四美元，桐油五五〇，三三六。一四美元，皮毛七一三，七五美元，膏油六八，八九六·七五美元，茶七〇，七六七·五一美元，草帽八六，八二七·八八美元，豬腸衣二五，〇二三·九五笑元，羽毛六，二〇〇·九五美元，金屬及其製品一八，三七九·九四美元，毛絨及生絲二，一七八·五五美元，蛋類七二，四一〇·二一美元，棉織品六八，七八二·三一美元，羊毛一九，九五九·九四美元，絲織品一六四，七四五·二二美元，蔬菜及其製品二二，四二五。一三美元，雜貨一三五，四一八·九七美元，棉布二九五，九三八·九八美元，棉紗九，〇〇〇·〇〇美元，礦砂五三三，七三九·〇一美元。</p>
<h3>國行準備供應輔幣　擅發代價券將嚴懲</h3>
<p>自金圓券開始發行以來，各方以法幣金銀外幣請求兌換者甚爲踴躍，因此市面上巳有普遍流通。惟對於輔幣劵幣，尙感缺乏。茲悉：中央銀行，爲適應社會需要，早已準備大批輔幣芬，可供兌換之需。各銀錢行莊及工商社會人士，如有需要，可逕向中央銀行業務發行兩局，請爲兌換。惟分幣尙未大量運到，各方找零，則仍可以法幣三萬元折合一分應付。外傳有行號公司擅發代價劵情事，殊屬藐視功令，破壞幣制。一經查實，自當依法嚴懲，以防流弊云。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>

<p>藥材供求平平，象貝逢高有吐，散市時適與前日軋平。枝條芩仍回原價，其餘亦無榮辱。</p>
<p>工業油脂新價，仍多照「八一九」市面喊價，但交易仍少做開。產地價格仍商，到貨寥寥無幾。運銷商均遭折本，客貨則根本絕跡。</p>
<p>桐油商情：（一）漢口來價到滬成本爲七六元，加上拆息則在八〇元以上。（二）小同行經公會議決，由沈元來，恒和，大來三行商一次配給一〇〇祖，侮担配價七〇元。（三）實際新開價格，可能在八〇元左右。</p>
<h3>紗市上落微細　棉布求多供少先小後堅</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因制限南運，紡建公司續有配售，標價亦較市値爲抵，（計二十支大飛艇等四種），因此人心漸吿虛怯，經警團派員到塲監視仍嚴，致現紗仍鮮做開，日本街需要者，可向紡建公司直接請購，塲內買戶益寡，賣者較夥。做開僅卅二支仙桃，金玉，二十支金城，金雙獅，紅蜂，飛馬，十支命寶星，四平蓮等七八類，價比限價略低，複製業見低有進，成交單十三張，計四十二件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開以紗布禁止南運，隔日龍頭挺升，當局有澈查張册之說，人心恐惶，浮多出籠，喊價平疲。嗣因銀根奇濫，引起布商及天津帮，長江帮駐滬申莊之競進，市呈求多供少狀態，各貨均在高檔徘徊，做價遵守「八一九」之限價成交，惟當同監視依然嚴密，都不敢伸手喊價。並爲抑制漲風，于十點二十分，委紡建公司大量拋售，此次正式放畢標售制，由紡建公司開價。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布每疋廿九元三角，四君子元直貢廿九元八角，跳鯉元嗶嘰廿五元，漂布廿八元五角，四君子元色絲光布卅三元，及彩花被單每條四元七角等十四種。</p>
<p>經核准者，計廠家二十張，棉布一千四百疋，布號八百七十二張，棉布三萬六千六百八十疋，被單五百九十條，收回通貨一百零七萬二千九百三十五萬金圓，塲內交易提早收市。十二磅龍頭細布廿九元五角結束，較上日徵好三角，與十九日法幣價八千八百五十萬元軋平，全日成交一千零六十疋。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕敎部對魯豫兩省流亡來京學生之復學事，巳與兩省來京之中學校長初步交換意見，對於擇地復校，戚聯合數校設立聯合中學，大體已商定。敎部在兩日內將綜合討論決定後，交兩省敎育行政當局執行。魯敎廳長已在京，可先實行；豫敎廳派來中等科長生病，現値豫省府改組，新任敎廳長未接任，對教部不日決定復學辦法執行勢須稍緩。但敎部爲顧念借住京市學校即將開學，對豫省須稍暹回省之學生擬另行覓屋集小暫住，以便京市各校開學上課。</p>
<h3>各校學費明可决定　市小校長昨會商收費標準　增校添班須提高地方教費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市中小學收費標準迄未決定。市敎局通日分別召集公私立中小學校長舉行座談會，聽取意見，業由李局長將各校長所提數字及敎局擬訂標準，彙報吳市長。現悉吳市長已定於明日下午邀集各公私立中小學校長敎職員代表，及市參議員等有關各方開會商討，作最後決定。</p>

<h3>紀念孔子與教師救國　教師節前夕朱教長撰文發表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕敎長朱家驊於本屆敎師節前夕發表「紀念孔子與敎師救國」一文內容略稱：「紀念孔誕：一面紀念孔子有敎無類，師表萬世的精神。一面紀念全國各級敎師，對國家敎育作堅苦卓絕，繼續不斷之貢獻。孔子生在周末亂世，但始終本其悲天憫人之懷，奮臂疾呼，以圖挽救頹勢，躋世界於大同。此種力挽狂瀾的踐履篤實精神，可使吾人想見其抱憂時救世，守死善道之苦心。方今共匪叛亂，舉國騷擾，比孔子當時環境尤爲惡劣。故對孔子濟世救民的偉大精神，目前亟需倡導。在今日戡亂時期，我全國敎師應學習孔子以仁爲己任，發揚撥亂反正之精神；息邪說，遏暴行，以解救人民倒懸。尤應精誠團結，一致在國家動員戡亂決策下，從事敎育上戡亂工作；使敎界本身成爲社會最大安定力量。今日紀念孔子誕辰，紀念敎師節，必須發動敎師救國運動。」末謂「孔子學不厭，敎不倦，三千弟子通六藝者七十二人。此種循循善誘，有敎無類的精神，足爲今日全國敎師楷模。吾人一面應發揚我國固有文化，培養靑年優良德性；一面應盡量啓發靑年愛護國家民族的正確思想；挽救今日中國危機。年來東北華北及各綏靖區，因受匪災而使靑年學生流離失所者，不計其數。而共匪之職業學生，又煽動學潮；使一般學生蒙其毒害，國家受其有形無形之破壞。我全國各級敎師定能協助政府，一心一德，共同挽救嚴重之危局。」</p>
<h3>世運自由車賽　何浩華覆車記　海納丘陵不幸慘劇特寫</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者鐘震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕今天八月七日（星期六）是世界運動會開始舉行比賽的第八日，吾國參加的中華代表團，自足球隊慘敗後，籃球隊亦不能進入決賽，田徑和游泳早就被淘汰，所以今天在海納丘陵（Herne　Hill）公園舉行的自由車比賽，無疑的是吾國中華隊最後的一綫希望。不料事出意外，在比賽時，吾國選手何浩華所駕自由車，在過終點五十碼的地方，與比利時選手之車相撞，竟遭覆車。在每小時六十哩的高速度，由傾斜的自由車跑道坡上跌下，左臂脫節，左鎖骨折斷突出，手腿皮肉盡破，血流滿地，慘不忍覩。幸在頭上戴有橡皮保護頭盔，不然早就頭蓋跌碎而喪生。吾中華代表團之最後希望全歸消滅，不勝惋惜。　何浩華君在一九三五年亦曾代表吾國出席柏林第十二屆世界運運會。此時何君年僅十九歲，當時隨同照料者，爲本屆幹事陸翔千君。何君是荷蘭僑生，在荷經營裝璜公司，因不能講國語，故一時曾有謠傳資格發生問題，結果證明確係中國籍，並無周折。何君在一九四三年曾在荷蘭比賽得自由車冠軍，上次在柏林時，首次逢得世界冠軍，其相差亦僅呎餘。不料此次在首次比賽後，即出意外，實爲吾中華隊之不幸。四千米及長途比賽，只得忍痛棄權。</p>
<p>八月七日（星期六）上午十時半，在倫敦市南部近郊的海納丘陵公園中，舉行首次自由車競賽，首先舉行的是千米短距離，何浩華甘列入第二組，與比利時特凡爾特對抗。開始時，以賽車規則第一圈需兩車並行，徐徐進行至兩圈開始時，即以高速度競爭。此次第一圈究畢時，何君以出車較慢，故落後比利時選手不少，以後在二分之一路程中，即開始追逐，到抵達終點前，兩中僅差半尺餘。競賽終了，比利時以達二分四秒爲冠軍。但何君在四千米，和長距離競饗時尙有競爭機會。但不料在經過終點時，因賽跑車素號煞車，不能立即停止，竟在五十碼外之斜坡上，何君車之前輪與特凡爾特的後輪相碰，自由車立即傾覆，何君被拋出丈餘，連翻四三次，讓入草地中是時四週觀衆，均高聲呌喊。其覆車慘狀，實無法形容。吾國幹事，及醫華顧問鄧炳明醫師，急入塲救護。記者亦隨同入塲中，何君躺在單床中，神志尙消醒，兩限淚如雨下，用英文高呼「我不能爲國家出力矣」。塲中各國職負，均素知何君爲歐洲著名自山車選手，今日遭此慘劇，莫不深爲感動。並據聞此次慘劇原因，爲車胎突然漏氣之故。記者興高采烈，攝取比賽鏡頭面來，敗興而返，心中無限惑慨。</p>

<h3>「也是人」</h3>
<p>— 張清</p>
<p>「也是人」者，Yes—man也。三十年前「白話小說」剛剛流行的時候，小說中每提起西洋人說話，恒以「也是」代中國話中的「對了」或「是的」。爲甚麼要這樣轉彎抹角呢—我們後生小子固然無從應　　大槪總也是趨時之一道罷。現在想到了「也是人」這個名字，倒也有點發思古之幽情了。</p>
<p>「也是人」三個字旣然是從外國進口的，那麼外國之一定很多這一類人，自然也可想而知了。譬如說美國的首都華盛頓就有「也是人之城」的雅號。蓋政府官衙雲集，就自然會看得見許許多多八面玲瓏的聰明人物，你說「今天天好」，他就一定回答「簡直好極了的天氣！一然後相額「哈哈」，各得其所。官塲慼酬，向例如此，反正大家心裏有數，表面上是總要笑嘻嘻的。</p>
<p>但「也是人」的滿口「也是」，最要緊的用處倒還不在敷衍同僚，而在侍候上司。他們不但善觀氣色，順風使舵，而且敏感萬分，萬事但求嘴上答應得熱鬧，決不認眞動手。因爲一動手就　瑜易見，做得好和做不好的可能性參半，萬一竟做得不好，被見面時笑嘻嘻的同事在上司脾氣不好時參你一本，豈不飯碗就生問題？</p>
<p>睿智的「也是人」深知飯碗的重要，他們自然不肯冒這種險。</p>
<p>但是，氣象萬千的衙門裏齊齊整整的坐滿了衣冠楚楚的大小官貝，竟然一天到晚專門看看小報談談女人，倒底也不大好看。而「也是人」是極重視「好看」的。於是，他們想出了一個表面上做事，而事實上無需做事的辦法：他們一天到晚讓公文以極慢的速度旅行，你蓋一個圖軍，他簽一個字，等到旅行的時間實在太長了的時候，就批一個綏辦」歸檔。</p>
<p>「也是人」說，他的作風是有哲學根據的，呌做「無爲而治」。新聞記者去訪問新上任的「也是人」時，他一樣也有談話發表，說是「不求有功，但求無過」。要無功無過，當然最好還是萬事「不做」。然而一點不做也不成，民意機關質詢起來無法繳卷。於是，大家就無可能的少做，反正經費困難永遠是個大好藉口。若是實在非做不可的事，就務求其做得「好看一而又便於報銷。</p>
<p>但是，倘使我套一句韓非子的腔調，倒也可以說一句「也是人不也是」的。眞正的一也是人」，自然不「也是」的時候也有。他有爭寵的敵人，必須於和顏悅色中加以謀害；而最麻煩的則是世界上似還有不識相的傻瓜，一心要做規規矩矩的好官，怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>於是乎植黨營私之風遂盛。</p>
<p>「也是人」不但「也是」，還要「被也是」。譬如說，「也是部長」受了氣，圓去大駡「也是司長」。「也是司長」就一定恭順聽完，然後說：「是，卑職該死！」回出去就　處長。處長恭順聽完之後，認錯，說「是」，回出云　科長。科長照樣恭順聽完，說「是」……一直到可憐的小科員。小科員回家之後就駡老婆，打兒子。</p>
<p>那個兒子怎樣呢？他挨打之後，也許就偷偷向地上吐日唾沫，駡一聲；媽的！」</p>
<p>就是如此。他長大之後，恐怕照樣也還是要「也是」下去的</p>
<h3>美國的電話荒</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>美國不但和上海一樣的在　房荒，並且也同樣的在鬧電話荒。貝爾電話公司在勝利後兩年多的時間中雖然新裝了六百五十萬電話，但是，積壓而未能應命的定單仍有一百五十萬份之多。</p>
<p>主要的缺乏是電綫和交換機，接通一次本市電話，其中過程複雜異常，電話器械之多，不可勝數。</p>
<p>在一九四五年，美國每兩人家有一架電話；現在則差不多每三家有兩架了。在一九四〇年，鄉下人大槪每四家有一架電話，如今也已發展到近乎兩家有一架的程度了。按人口分配而論，舊金山的電話最多，每一百個人有四十四架電話。華盛頓居次，每百人有四十一架；紐約再次之，每百人平均得二十九架。</p>
<p>電話愈難裝，似乎使人加倍的要想裝。要裝一架電話的人們所出的小費達五百元之多。因爲退伍軍人有裝電話的優先權，所以有些公司便利用他們爲幌子。又因爲營業電話較私人電話優先，於是有些住在公寓裏的人便租了一套寫字間生財，把卦室僞裝成營業的寫字間。更有些健康的人請醫生帮忙，證明他們有病，以便裝電話時佔先；申請裝電話的「病人」一多，有些電話公司的職員竟不得不把醫藥字典放在身邊。他們有時候發現醫生的報吿書中所用的看上去嚇人的病症名詞其實不過說病人患重傷風或者喉嚨痛而已。</p>
<p>美國人打電話的次數也多了。他捫現在一天中所打的長途電話比在一九四〇年一星期的通話次數還多，與海外通話的次數則爲一九四〇年的總數的十倍。</p>
<p>即便是兒童，也比戰前多打電話。學校一散課，電話就突然的增多起來。電話公司會經登報請求兒童們節省電話。新近，貝爾公司的總經理收到了一封一個十幾歲的男孩子寫給他的信，他說他的社交生活因爲缺少一架電話而受「妨礙」，信中有這標一句話：「女孩子們不能够和我通電話，她們也在抱怨呢！」那位總經理覆了他一封婉轉的信，在信尾附加說：「附言：當我十六歲的時候，我也沒有電話。」</p>
<h3>吳遊偶憶</h3>
<p>— 曹靖陶</p>
<p>日前偶遊吳門，飲茗茂苑，憶乙丑間與况蕙風先生日集於此，屈指且逾二十年，蕙翁墓早宿草，而余亦垂垂老矣。撫今追昔，感慨系之。</p>
<p>余少習吟事，看宵得句云：「春宵不成眠，獨守一燈靜，露華滋砌，轆　響銅井。風來　自波，月出花寫影，鄰　忽發聲，流思託荒憬。」蕙翁於陳散原先生許見此詩，頗爲嘉許，乙丑夏，翁移居吳門，訪余於專諸巷，是爲余識翁之始。</p>
<p>蕙翁是年六十有八，　貌道裝，飄飄欲仙，偶過街頭，萬人注目。</p>
<p>一日，吳瞿安先生自京來，宴董翁父子於城中飯店，邀余曁俞粟廬先生作陪。時粟廠年近八旬，老態能鍾，蕙翁力請試歌，居然腔圓字步，響遏行雲，不可及也。</p>
<p>瞿安召伎侑酒，一妓貌不揚，而蕙翁獨賞之，公子竊竊私議。蕙翁因問曰：「　二人看此女如何？」公子赧然，不敢答可否。翁笑曰：「此女似俗而寶雅，所謂濁中清也！特汝等年稚，不能知其美耳！二座爲之拊掌</p>
<p>蕙翁精研討餘，才力卓絕，與朱古微先生並駕齊驅。翁自言生平罕爲詩，偶有所作，亦不能工。其早年有絕句若干首，偶爲余背誦之，今已失憶，惟記「三十六橋天下無，江南人物最姑蘇」二句，平心論之，風韵實與詞爲近世。</p>
<p>蕙翁寓吳，時間甚短，以避內亂，重返滬濱。越月忽過蘇，娶某氏女，其豪興亦不亞於熊秉三李石曾輩也。</p>
<h3>雲深處近句</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>既事用姚　難見寄韻</p>
<p>遠　煙花仔細看，熱風熨　痕乾，添枝插葉眞須勢，溪口山阿要在安，臭味相忘誰入室，丹　無用我濡翰，近來略戒當門意，幅幅雲　有石巒。（題墨蘭軸）</p>
<p>秋署如烘渴竟除，　年慼說換瓜書，三朝甘脆便便腹，一味淸凉落落居；待笑稚兒忙記得，却憐老子夫容與，裁詩作謝眞無賴，爲想東門定有餘。</p>
<h3>文溯閣藏書無恙</h3>
<p>— 翟梅林</p>
<p>昨閱本刋所載周庭梧先生「文溯閣藏書」一文，愛念故國文物之情，實深同感。筆者頃由瀋陽故鄉來京就食，知文溯閣四庫全書，現仍全部完好，保存於潘陽淸故宮西側「文溯閣」原址。房舍高亢，册架裝璜完整無缺。自九一八後歷經敵偽共匪等控制，均對之愛護有加，日人幷無刧運情事。八一五接收後，中央且派金毓黻氏負責整理東北文物，日有增補，該閣逐日開放，任人閱覽，各本不獨字跡秀美，裝璜紙質亦雅樸莊麗無比，彌足珍寳。</p>
<p>此外，有淸二百餘年，歷朝亡故帝王后妃，例賜王牒，其全部玉牒，作碧綠色，以后妃品位之不同而有大小之分，都百數十函，亦與四庫全書，同在一處展覽。</p>
<p>文溯閣備有題名簿一，供瀏覽者紀名之用，吳鐵城，戴天仇，　維鈞，趙戴文諸先生均曾列名。此簿行將與全書及玉牒三者，共流芳於後世。題名之日月槪在民十餘年問，距今巳二十餘載。所貴者不獨題名者之得覽全書，而在彼等在潘之時日，實各有所負之偉大使命，其影響於中國，當較全書或尤爲重要。民十七年以來今日之歷史，或即造端於彼時，與全書又一段烟緣也。</p>
<p>今故鄕烽火連天，黎庶塗炭，國寶幸尙無恙，特述梗槪，以吿有心人士。然皮之不存，毛其焉附？若國土之不重，則又何貴有此四庫全書乎？</p>
<h3>黃金</h3>
<p>— 錢文</p>
<p>王奔亡時，宮中藏有黃金六十萬斤。他沒有把這國家所有的貴金屬視同私產，不肯沈於海底，塊於山谷，而留給後來的人，這是政治失敗者光明的行爲。漢代國有黃金，積存於宮中，並非他抱住不放。古今權制不同，別人算過，六十萬斤即等於淸代的二十八萬八千斤。</p>
<p>董卓在　塢中收撤掠得的寳物很多，但是黃金頗少，據說是二三萬斤，銀也不過八九萬斤。是黃金散在民間不易搜括，抑是他不大重視黃白物，二者必居其一了。淸代之和珅，全部私產値銀八萬萬兩，而他家中夾牆之內，搜出金錠金葉祗二萬六千八百餘兩，這也不能算多，難道他也不重視黃金？</p>
<p>民間藏金難以估計，任防述異記云，袁紹在冀州時，滿市黃金而無斗粟；劉備在荆州時，粟與金同價；永嘉之亂，洛中國荒，懷帝便人觀市，珠玉金銀，開委市中，而無粟麥；漢末大　，江淮間童謠云，持金易粟，貴於黃金；洛中室謠云，雖有千兩金，無如我斗粟。戰亂饑荒，無粟不可異，民間黃金之多如此，無怪任氏大以爲異而述之也。顧炎武說，唐宋以前，上下通行之貨，一皆以錢而已。又引文獻通考，　梁時，交廣之域，全以金銀交易。這是民間存金日漸增多之一證。</p>
<p>古代黃金不如今日之値錢，　炎武說，洪武八年，金一兩當銀四兩，這是所謂四換。洪武十八年五換，永樂十一年七換半，萬曆中七八換，崇禎中十換，元至大時則十換。這可見金價漸高，而又變動無常。至大崇禎，先後三百二三十年，一樣是十換。淸末高至三十六換；民元亦不過如此。民國二十六年戰事方烈時，大約是一百換，但我記不淸了。宋慼星天工開物一書，雕板時爲崇禎丁丑年，書中謂黃金美者，其値去黑鐵一萬六千倍。附以顧炎武十換之說，其時銀一百六十兩可買黃金一斤，亦即可買黑鐵一萬六千斤即是十噸弱。</p>
<p>宋氏又說，凡金質至重，每銅方寸重一兩者，銀照依其則，寸增重三錢；銀方寸重一兩者，金照依其則，寸增重二錢。這是三百年前我國人所知的金屬此重。</p>
<p>古人以爲黃金之消耗，莫甚於造佛像，這是事實。如魏書謂興光元年籌釋迦立像五尊，各高一丈六尺，都用赤金二萬五千斤；天安中造釋迦立像，高四十三尺，用赤金十萬斤，黃金六百斤。其實金之消耗不止此，富人的用器和屋內的屛風窗門之類，塗金的不少，其總量必定大於各佛寺中的佛像所用的，但是分散之故，不如佛像之顯著罷了。天上開物云，凡金箔每金七　造方寸，這實在太厚，現在沒有如此奢侈的了。照此書說，用一千片粘鋪物面，可蓋縱橫三尺，因爲三尺平方則爲九百方寸，要用七　重一片的金箔九百片，用金六兩三錢之多。我以爲帝王　造佛像，所用金箔必定路厚，民間所用則略薄也行。科學家說，一　之金，事實上可碾成七十五英寸見方之金箔，其厚薄則爲三十六萬七千分之一英寸，而一　即是金衡一磅之五千七百六十分之一。</p>
<p>戰亂之後，我的結婚金指環也不知去向了，口裏還有的金假　二隻，不知含純金幾何。</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan's Economic Control Commission Approves Measures to Lower Interest Rates of Banks and Private Money Houses; Public Utility Prices and Wages to Be Frozen Based on the August 19th Standard; New Tax Rates to Take Effect Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan's Economic Control Commission held its first meeting on the morning of the 26th, chaired by Weng Wenhao, who also serves as the head of the commission. In addition to Zhang Wansheng and Jiang Jingguo, who are overseeing economic controls in Ping and Shanghai, respectively, committee members Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Yan Jiagan, and Xu Baiyuan, who also serves as the secretary-general, were all in attendance. Key officials from relevant ministries, including Wang Shijie, Sun Yueqi, Guan Jiyu, Ling Hongxun, and Executive Yuan Secretary-General Li Weiguo, were also present. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. Three important decisions were made regarding strengthening economic controls: (1) Reduce bank interest rates. In addition to stipulating that national bank interest rates shall not exceed 2.5 to 5 percent per month, the interest rates for commercial banks and private money houses, which were negotiated to be 13 percent per month, were still deemed too high. It was decided to further reduce them. The resolution was to lower the monthly interest rate to within 10 percent starting September 1st, and further reduce it to within 5 percent after September 16th. (2) Approve the procedures for using deposits held abroad after they are transferred to the Central Bank. According to the Presidential Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters, foreign exchange assets held abroad by nationals should be transferred to the Central Bank. However, individuals may still use them in accordance with Article 9 of the "Regulations for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Held Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China" and Article 4 of the "Regulations for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by Citizens." The procedures for their use were approved liberally during the meeting. (3) Restrict price increases for public utilities and wage increases. The prices of public transportation services and worker wages nationwide should be based on the August 19th standard and should not be increased. The issue of whether adjustments are needed will be decided by the Executive Yuan as a whole at an appropriate time, depending on the circumstances at the time. Individual adjustments will not be allowed. During the meeting on the 26th, the heads of various relevant departments first reported on various situations since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters three days ago and reviewed them. The overall situation was generally considered satisfactory. In particular, the people's enthusiastic exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan notes in the past three days, which implemented the second item of the emergency decree, was progressing very smoothly and was considered a great success. The prices of food crops have mostly stabilized according to the standards stipulated in the decree, and some have even fallen. However, only a few materials and a few areas have experienced slight fluctuations. According to reports from relevant units, effective countermeasures have been proposed for this phenomenon and will be announced and implemented soon. Prices in major cities across the country, including Peiping, Tianjin, Xi'an, and Hankou, are stable. Beijing and Shanghai have experienced slight fluctuations, while Guangzhou has experienced the most severe fluctuations. Measures are being taken to stop them. Finally, a discussion was held on the measures proposed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to strengthen the management of important materials, control prices, and crack down on hoarding and speculation. A broad exchange of views took place. Because it was already past 1:00 PM, no decision was made and the matter will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] After the promulgation of supplementary measures for fiscal reorganization, Jiang Bingge, Director of the National Taxation Bureau, said on the 26th that the adjustment of the new tax rates will be implemented starting from the 27th.</p>

<h3>Zhang Lisheng Convenes a Meeting with Leading Business Figures in Peiping</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Peiping, 26th] Zhang Lisheng convened a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 26th with leading figures from Peiping commercial banks, private money houses, and various chambers of commerce, asking for assistance in financial and economic reforms. Zhang said that the government is determined to strictly implement the current price policy based on the principle of "fairness and justice." To avoid excuses for raising prices, public utilities will not increase prices for the time being. Zhang emphasized that individual interests must be lower than national interests. Mayor Liu also said that the rumor that only decreases are allowed but not increases is a misunderstanding. Within the prices of August 19th, the government will absolutely not interfere. The municipal government summoned some merchants who raised prices within the current price on the 25th to inquire about the reasons for the price increase.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan Will Propose a Censure Against State-Owned Enterprises That Raised Prices After August 19th; Principles Determined at a Joint Meeting of the Transportation and Finance Committees</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The principle of the Control Yuan proposing a censure against state-owned enterprises that raised prices was discussed at a joint meeting of the Transportation and Finance Committees of the Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 26th. The revision of the wording was decided, and Zhang Dinghua, Tang Honglie, and Sun Yulin were appointed to work together to organize it, and then submit it for co-signing by other committee members before it is proposed. After the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters, prices were required to be frozen at the level of August 19th and not to be increased. However, transportation enterprises such as China and Central Airlines adjusted their ticket prices from the 20th, increasing them by 85 percent, which caused widespread dissatisfaction. To uphold the emergency decree, the Control Yuan members held meetings separately by the Transportation and Finance Committees on the morning of the 26th to discuss the issue. The Transportation Committee immediately resolved to propose a censure against the price increases by state-owned enterprises. The three resolutions of the Finance Committee were: (1) Transportation enterprises should maintain the "August 19th" prices. (2) If it is to help state-owned enterprises achieve self-sufficiency, the costs should be calculated well and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. (3) How to adjust the prices should be the responsibility of the Legislative Yuan. Subsequently, the Transportation and Finance Committees decided to hold a joint meeting at 3:30 PM on the 26th to continue discussing the resolutions of the two committees. Chairman Sun Yulin first reported on the resolutions of the two committees, followed by a broad exchange of views by the committee members. The principle of the censure was then established. It was also suggested at the meeting that the current members of the Legislative Yuan, the Central Committee, and others enjoy half-price travel benefits, which obviously cause losses to the income of the companies. It would be best to cancel these benefits to increase income and help the companies achieve self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3>Rumors of President Chiang Meeting with MacArthur; Shao Yulin Directly Denies Them; Zhang Qun's Trip to Japan is Purely for Private Observation</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] On the second day of meeting with leading figures in Japanese political circles, Zhang Qun met with Ken Inukai, advisor to the Democratic Party, and Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the National Cooperative Party, on the morning of the 26th. Inukai visited Zhang at the Chinese delegation at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 26th, but the content of the talks was not disclosed. Following Zhang's meeting with Inukai, Zhang met with Miki at 11:00 AM. It is understood that Zhang praised Miki for his efforts in promoting the work of the party. The National Cooperative Party has been promoting cooperative movements in Japan.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhang Qun met with Kijuro Shidehara of the Democratic Liberal Party on the afternoon of the 26th. Shigeru Yoshida was unable to attend due to illness. It is reported that Shidehara explained the current political situation in Japan to Zhang. The two had a two-hour conversation. In the evening of the 26th, "professorial" figures Masao Takahashi and Hyoe Ouchi will jointly visit Zhang. Zhang will also meet with Kuomintang members in the Tokyo and Yokohama areas to hear reports.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 26th that Zhang Qun stated when meeting with Ashida yesterday that China had sought an agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to conclude a Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible. He also said that Japan could not be revived without China's help. Ashida agreed with Zhang's views and assured Zhang of Japan's peaceful intentions. He also said that Japanese militarism would never be revived.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Shao Yulin, former private advisor to Executive Yuan Zhang Qun, directly denied on the 26th the rumors reported in foreign newspapers that Zhang intended to plan a meeting between President Chiang and MacArthur. Shao also said: "Outside speculation that Zhang is charged with laying the foundation for the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations, and with stopping the growth of communism in Asia, and with establishing a Sino-Japanese alliance, to which Korea and other countries may join later," lacks a factual basis. He reiterated that Zhang was not charged with any special official mission. He said that Zhang's visit to Japan was purely a fact-finding tour in a private capacity. Shao concluded that by listening to reports from the Allied Headquarters on the policies and work of the Allied Headquarters, and the opinions of Japanese political leaders, Zhang was only trying to get an impression of Japan after the war.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>An Understanding of Confucius' Philosophy of Life - Commemorating Teachers' Day -</h3>
<p>Confucius was a great educator of ancient China. Today, as we commemorate the Supreme Sage and Foremost Teacher Confucius, we must first recognize his achievements in education and his academic accomplishments. However, the determination of one's educational theory often depends on one's philosophy of life. Therefore, if we want to understand Confucius' educational objectives, we must first study his various perspectives on the philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Confucius lived in a chaotic era. Externally, the Yi and Di barbarians were strong and evil, and the various Xia peoples suffered humiliation. Internally, the ethical codes were not upheld, wars occurred frequently, and there were excessive levies and taxes, causing the people to live in misery. Therefore, Confucius, with a compassionate heart, made a great vow to save the world and its people, painstakingly exploring and practicing the principles and methods of morality in order to cultivate himself and bring peace to others. As Confucius said, "Shen! My way is consistent." This "consistent way" is the fundamental principle of cultivating oneself and bringing peace to others, as invented by Confucius, and it is also the highest principle of practicing morality. This is not only an original thought of Confucius but also the core of Confucius' teachings. The so-called "consistent way" is benevolence; benevolence is the nature of man, that is, the way of man. In other words, it is the relationship between people and the common rationality between people. Confucius said, "Benevolence is being human." This means that benevolence takes people as its object and is not isolated. The purpose of practicing benevolence is to extend oneself to others and serve others. The so-called "the benevolent loves others" is a concrete explanation of benevolence. Because loving others is benevolence, benevolence can not only be exhausted by the virtue of self-cultivation but must also be achieved by cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world, reaching the ideal world of great harmony—the world of benevolence—and then the virtue of benevolence can be fully realized. The process begins with self-cultivation and ends with bringing peace to others. Confucius said, "A gentleman does not deviate from benevolence even for the time of a meal. He is sure to be in it in haste, and he is sure to be in it in adversity." The meaning lies in this.</p>
<p>The way of Confucius is based on the pursuit of the realization of "benevolence" as its only doctrine. His words of loyalty and forgiveness are methods for advancing towards benevolence. As Zeng Zi said, "The Master's way is loyalty and forgiveness, and nothing more." Loyalty is a means of self-cultivation; to cultivate oneself, one must first exhaust oneself. "Exhausting oneself is loyalty"; the so-called exhausting oneself must first pay attention to and cultivate the motives of one's actions, which is the effort of self-restraint. That is, one must absolutely reject any improper temptation, and even be willing to sacrifice one's life for the sake of realizing benevolence. "A man of noble aspirations and benevolence will not seek to live at the expense of benevolence, but will sacrifice his life to achieve benevolence." Sacrificing one's life to achieve benevolence can only be done with the spirit of "loyalty"; with loyalty, one can distinguish right from wrong, and one can also firmly adhere to goodness. Secondly, even if we have the proper motives for our actions, we still cannot guarantee that the results of our actions will be satisfactory and good, so we must also have some control over the results of our actions. This is the effort of restoring ritual. Restoring ritual includes two meanings: broad learning and restrained conduct. Broad learning refers to seeking knowledge as preparation for practice, and restrained conduct is the practice of behavior, using the rituals formulated by ancient sages as norms to restrain one's own behavior. Because the knowledge gained may not necessarily help improve individual behavior, one must follow the restraints of rituals, tempered and forged, so that the results of behavior can be reliably grasped.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a means of bringing peace to others; to bring peace to others, one must first extend oneself. Extending oneself includes two aspects: positive and negative: "What you want for yourself, do for others"; "What you do not want for yourself, do not do to others." The actual paths for its implementation are politics and education. First, in politics, Confucius advocated starting with the rectification of names. He believed that if one wanted to "reverse the chaos and return to righteousness," one must use the means of rectifying names, implementing praise for good and贬斥 for evil, to show encouragement and punishment, so that rebellious ministers and traitors would know what to fear, and the national discipline could be established. Therefore, Confucius revised the Spring and Autumn Annals, criticizing with his pen and condemning in his heart, with the aim of preventing evil from being confused with righteousness. As for his political ideal, it is to seek the realization of the doctrine of virtuous rule. The so-called doctrine of virtuous rule can be explained from Confucius' words "cultivate oneself with reverence," "cultivate oneself to bring peace to others," and "if you lead with righteousness, who would dare to be unrighteous," "when one's person is upright, one will be obeyed without orders; when one's person is not upright, one will not be obeyed even with orders," "lead them with virtue, regulate them with rituals, and they will have shame and be reformed." That is to say, governing according to benevolence and virtue, the country can be greatly governed. Secondly, in education, Confucius advocated cultivating "people," cultivating people to serve the country, that is, the so-called "benevolent." His educational method is entirely his own means of self-cultivation, honestly telling others his own methods of self-cultivation, the so-called "if you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to achieve yourself, achieve others." Specifically speaking, that is, when you want to realize benevolence and become your own personality, not only can your completed personality move others, but once you have completed your own personality, you will definitely want to further complete the personality of others. In other words, the loyal can be forgiving, and the forgiving can be loyal. Conversely, if one is not loyal, one cannot achieve oneself and others, how can one achieve others? If one is not forgiving, one cannot achieve others, how can one achieve oneself? Therefore, Confucius had the attitude of "learning without being satisfied" and "reviewing the old to know the new" to educate himself, and he could express the enthusiasm and interest of "teaching without discrimination," "teaching tirelessly," and "patiently guiding."</p>
<p>Confucius' unique views on the attitude towards life, although more than two thousand years have passed, are still correct and unchangeable. Their philosophical and educational value has not changed in the slightest, and they are worthy of admiration for hundreds of generations and deep study for all ages. Therefore, the government stipulates Confucius' birthday as Teachers' Day, which is to regard all teachers in the country as incarnations of Confucius and entrust the responsibility of realizing Confucius' advocacy entirely to teachers, and its significance is extremely important. As we hold the commemoration of Teachers' Day today, it seems that we are not only seeking solutions to issues such as teachers' status, treatment, and further education, but also in being able to understand Confucius' philosophy of life in order to seek changes in temperament. In other words, it is what is called "changing life." We believe that in today's world where people's hearts are treacherous and human desires are rampant, if we want to use the power of education to save the difficult times and revive people's hearts, we must first have the ambition to "take the world as our responsibility"; secondly, we must have the attitude of "choosing good and adhering to it," so that we can be successful everywhere.</p>
<p>Confucius traveled around the states, not afraid of hardship, although motivated by the compassion for the world, but its key lies in the ambition of "taking the world as one's own responsibility" to show the world. Zheng Shengmiao once asked Confucius: "Why are you so restless? Are you not trying to be flattering?" Confucius said: "I dare not be flattering, I hate stubbornness." Confucius' restlessness was aimed at saving the world and bringing peace to the people. For example, Chang Ju and Jie Ni said to Zi Lu: "The world is in a torrent, and who can change it?" Confucius replied: "One cannot live with birds and beasts. If I am not a follower of the people, who am I with?" The pessimistic nihilists see the world when the Way prevails, and hide when the Way does not prevail. They only grab the easy way, eat ready-made meals, and they are unwilling to manage the work of transforming society, so the evil society where "benevolence and righteousness are filled, leading beasts to eat people, and people will eat each other" is ignored by them, and they leave, living with wood and stone, playing with deer and pigs, and they congratulate themselves on their purity. Confucius, on the other hand, could not bear it in his heart, and would never lightly shirk his responsibility for his own ease. We must learn this spirit of "exhausting oneself," work hard to promote education, and never slack off, only using words like "difficult" and "thorny" to shirk responsibility, or using the beautiful name of "high-mindedness and far-sightedness" to cover up mistakes. We must recognize that education is for all, and if one person in society has not been educated and influenced, it is always our responsibility that has not been fulfilled and our ambition has not been achieved.</p>
<p>Confucius had the great ambition of saving the world and bringing peace to the people. He ran around all his life, endured hardships, and was trapped in Chen and Cai, and was ridiculed in Zheng and Wei. Although his way was ultimately not practiced, his attitude of "teaching goodness and adhering to it" and his spirit of "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it" are truly great. Confucius firmly believed that justice would ultimately prevail, and he said with certainty: "Heaven gave me virtue, what can Huan Tui do to me!" This inviolable spirit is enough to overcome all difficulties, regardless of harvest, but only engage in cultivation. As Zi Lu said: "A gentleman serves in order to practice his righteousness. If the Way is not practiced, I know it;" Dong Zhongshu said: "Correct his righteousness without seeking his benefit, and clarify his path without calculating his merit." Today, there are many people in China's education circle who have a solid foundation in learning and a lofty ambition, but they are also inevitably limited by the general utilitarian view, holding a pessimistic view of education, worshiping the superficial in their work, and often feeling sacrificed without reward, and even being eager to approach things that are beneficial to themselves, and avoiding things that are harmful to themselves. Of course, it is not right to make scattered efforts without a goal, or to bend oneself to please others and vainly hope to achieve something, but it is also not the attitude that teachers should have to stubbornly adhere to the view of protecting oneself and avoiding responsibility and neglecting one's duties.</p>
<p>The most systematic explanation of Confucius' philosophy is the book "The Great Learning." The Great Learning begins by proposing three major principles: "The way of the Great Learning lies in illuminating illustrious virtue, in renewing the people, and in resting in the highest good." The so-called "in illuminating illustrious virtue" means not to let the virtue that is born be drowned out, and to know how to temper it, magnify it, and it can be said that it is to determine our outlook on life. The so-called "in renewing the people" means to awaken the people, educate the people, and make the lives of the people improve. The so-called "in resting in the highest good" means that one must make all the actions of oneself and others reach the best extreme. In today's words, we are living in this difficult era, and only with a deep understanding of life can we truly understand the value of education. We must be driven by the psychology of "the benevolent loves others" and shoulder the mission of building the country through education. Only in this way can we talk about the power of education, and only in this way can we live up to the enthusiastic commemoration of Teachers' Day today!</p>
<h3>Investigation of the July 5th Incident Completed; Supervisory Yuan Presents Impeachment, Believing that Chen Jicheng, Zhao Changyan, and Bai Shiwei's Measures Were Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee members Gu Weixiang and Hu Wenhui were previously dispatched on the 3rd of this month to fly to Beiping to investigate the truth of the July 5th Incident. They completed their investigation on the 20th. In addition to collecting relevant information in Beiping, the two members also questioned relevant personnel on the scene, interviewed Chinese and foreigners in Dongjiaominxiang at the time, and went to the scene for investigation. Based on the results obtained, they prepared a report, which is over 4,000 words long. It is divided into two parts: "Causes of the Incident and the Course of Events" and "Analysis of the July 5th Incident." At the same time, they presented an impeachment against Chen Jicheng, commander of the Beiping Garrison, Zhao Changyan, battalion commander of the search battalion of the 208th Division of the Youth Army, and Bai Shiwei, deputy director of the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, for their inappropriate measures. The report and the impeachment were submitted to the Control Yuan by Hu Wenhui when he returned to Beijing on the 23rd. The Control Yuan has already announced the impeachment case today, which has also been established by the review of the Control Committee members Tang Honglie, Jin Yueke, and Chen Yushan. On the 25th, the Control Yuan sent it to the Executive Yuan. The impeachment is divided into three parts for Chen Jicheng, Zhao Changyan, and Bai Shiwei: (1) The part for Chen Jicheng briefly states: When the students petitioned and marched on July 5th, Chen Jicheng did not follow Commander-in-Chief Fu's instructions to order his subordinates not to carry guns and not to hit students. Moreover, the 208th Division is a field force, and using it to suppress students would inevitably lead to incidents. Furthermore, the 208th Division and Beiping students have a poor relationship, and Chen Jicheng failed to consider this when handling the matter. Although it was out of line and violated discipline for the students to destroy the Senate, Chen Jicheng failed to personally and properly guard the scene when the students confronted the military police all day, and ordered Bai Shiwei, a police officer, to command the military police and gendarmerie, and he was unable to properly restrain his subordinates, which ultimately led to the tragic incident in front of Xu Huidong's residence where students were shot and killed by soldiers of the 208th Division. Chen Jicheng cannot but bear the responsibility for inappropriate measures and dereliction of duty. (2) The part for Zhao Changyan briefly states: When the students petitioned in front of Xu Huidong's residence on the afternoon of July 5th and were unable to meet Xu Huidong, Zhao Changyan was ordered to lead his troops to the scene for guard, and Deputy Director of the Police Bureau Bai Shiwei was appointed as the commander. Zhao Changyan failed to obey Bai Shiwei's orders and allowed his subordinates to take combat measures. He also failed to immediately stop the soldiers from firing, which led to the tragedy. Zhao Changyan should be held responsible for allowing his subordinates to kill people and handed over to the military law court for trial. (3) The part for Bai Shiwei briefly states: Bai Shiwei, as the deputy director of the police bureau, was ordered to be the commander, but he failed to properly coordinate with the military police and gendarmerie. When he saw that the troops' deployment was serious, he should have restrained his subordinates and accepted the students' conditions for disposal. Later, he also failed to timely notify the troops that the students were about to disperse and return, which led to the tragedy due to misunderstanding. Bai Shiwei is not without negligence in handling the matter, incompetence in commanding, and dereliction of duty.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Prevents Capital Flight to Hong Kong; Sends Large Number of Military Police to Monitor Gold and Currency Transactions in the Market; Song Ziwen Will Go to Hong Kong to Discuss the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 26th Dispatch] The Guangdong authorities have strictly prevented capital from fleeing to Hong Kong. They have now dispatched a large number of military police to extensively monitor the gold, currency, and Hong Kong dollar transactions in the Guangzhou market, and the connection is gradually shrinking. The scope of circulation of the Hong Kong dollar in Guangdong and designated banks is limited as much as possible to exchange Hong Kong dollars with gold yuan. At present, a large number of Hong Kong dollars have been absorbed, and there is absolute certainty. Strict surveillance will be carried out at the key points of the Sino-Hong Kong water and land transportation to prevent merchants and travelers from carrying Hong Kong dollars into the country. Gold yuan are also not allowed to be carried to Hong Kong. According to news from related parties: Chairman Song Ziwen will go to Hong Kong within the week to discuss the Sino-Hong Kong agreement. Mr. Qian Shihe, the person in charge of Hong Kong Customs, suddenly flew to Shanghai on the 24th. It is widely believed that his trip to Shanghai is related to the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement.</p>
<h3>Gold Yuan Appears in Hong Kong; Overseas Remittances at National Banks Active</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 26th Dispatch] The gold yuan appeared for the first time in the local money market today, which aroused considerable interest and curiosity among the local residents. Local banks and money shops are engaged in the exchange of new currency. The reporter learned from the banks today that since the banks announced the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the gold yuan, the overseas remittances of our national banks in the area have become active. It only costs one Hong Kong dollar to remit 100 gold yuan. Due to the rapid exchange and low fees, the various national banks in the area have a great potential to immediately acquire all the overseas remittances that were previously monopolized by local banks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 26th Dispatch] The enthusiasm for the exchange of new currency after its issuance is enough to show the credit and support of the new currency. However, in recent days, there are still a small number of speculators who take advantage of the fact that the new subsidiary coins have not yet arrived to privately trade foreign currencies for profit. The police bureau has dispatched a large number of police officers to monitor for days. Yesterday, more than a dozen people were arrested in the Thirteen Hongs financial market. The Thirteen Hongs has become desolate and no longer has its former prosperity.</p>

<h3>Merchants and Citizens Raising Prices Sent to Special Criminal Court; Prices in the Capital Stabilizing; Vegetable Prices Generally Decreased After Market Control</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] According to information from the Social Affairs Bureau of Nanjing: The market reaction in Nanjing after the issuance of the Gold Yuan was that prices only fluctuated slightly in the first one or two days, and by the 20th, they had entered a stable state. The Yuan's agencies strictly supervised and enforced the central government's orders without any leniency. All merchants and citizens who violated the regulations were dealt with according to the law. As of noon on the 26th, there were 25 cases of price gouging that were investigated by the police and sent to the bureau. Twelve merchants whose cases were more serious were immediately transferred to the Special Tribunal for legal processing. Merchants and citizens were deeply aware of the government's determination to implement this major policy and became vigilant, no longer harboring any speculative intentions. As a result, the market quickly stabilized, with prices frozen at the level of August 19th for many days, and many automatically lowered their prices, such as for daily necessities like rice, flour, oil, salt, sugar, and cloth. Regarding the prices of small vegetable markets, which are most easily affected by fluctuations during any country's currency reform, there was a slight occurrence of this in Nanjing in the past two or three days. However, starting on the morning of the 26th, the City Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department formed several inspection teams to directly control the vegetable markets. The general price of vegetables immediately and universally decreased within one or two hours.

<h3>Chengdu and Kunming Use Old Nickel Coins; Market Suddenly Plunges into Chaos</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 26th] The Chengdu Municipal Government announced on the 26th that old nickel coins would be in general circulation, and the market suddenly plunged into unprecedented chaos. Most of the city's shops closed and suspended business, and retail prices soared by 100%. The reason is that nickel coins were mostly used in Chengdu during the war and have long been regarded as waste. Many who hoarded them suddenly became rich overnight and rushed to buy goods, causing chaos. The Municipal Government is handling the situation urgently.</p>
<p>Also, Chengdu began to forcibly implement price controls on the 26th. The Provincial Government specially stipulated the prices of 24 types of daily necessities in six categories, which were monitored by the police, and violators were sent to the Special Criminal Court.</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 26th] After the Central Bank announced that nickel coins would continue to be used as before, the Kunming market was extremely chaotic. The value of silver rose sharply, and there was a rush to buy yarn, cloth, and general merchandise. Rice prices soared, and the common people felt particularly uneasy.</p>

<h3>Berlin Communists Demonstrate and Riot; Break into City Hall; Sing "The Internationale" and Shout "Anti-American" Slogans; Openly Demand Overthrow of Elected City Government</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] Communist demonstrators and rioters broke down the doors of Berlin City Hall at 2:10 PM (Berlin time) on the 26th and stormed into the city hall building, intending to overthrow the democratically elected non-Communist city government.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] The Berlin City Council canceled its meeting on the afternoon of the 26th after the Communists openly declared their intention to overthrow the elected city government and concentrated in various districts of the city. The City Council was originally scheduled to meet at the city hall in the Soviet zone at 2:00 PM, but before noon, the concentrated Communists had already set off for the city hall. The City Council's Council of Elders then voted at noon to cancel the meeting. At the intersection of Anhalter Straße on the border between the American and Soviet zones, American police almost clashed with 150 Communist rioters. All police in the Western sector were ordered to be on alert on the morning of the 26th, as the intentions of the Communists had become clear. Therefore, when the situation in Anhalter Straße became tense, ten police squads were dispatched to provide reinforcements. The crowd held Communist flags, sang the Internationale, and shouted: "American capitalists, get out! This is not America, it is a Soviet area. You bombed our houses, killed our women and children, and now you don't give us food to eat. Get out!" The demonstrators gathered in the Soviet zone's Lustgarten Park in the morning. Although the Western Occupation Forces dispatched all their monitors, they still could not protect the city hall, as it was located in the "neutral area" designated by the four powers within the Soviet zone. According to the chief of police, they were ordered to repel the rioters if they invaded the American zone. Lieutenant Colonel Keightley said that unless specifically ordered by senior American authorities, American MPs would not be dispatched to the border. The city council agenda included four highly explosive proposals, any of which could be used by the Communists as a pretext to overthrow the elected government. An American newspaper stated that "if the Communists attempt to seize the government through large-scale demonstrations, they will receive retribution and reap what they sow."</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] The democratically elected city government of Berlin seemed on the verge of collapse on the 26th due to harassment and attacks by Communist demonstrators. Supported by a large number of action committee members, party workers, factory workers, and pro-Soviet figures, the Communists held their own city council meeting. It is generally believed that this is the first wave of Soviet efforts to establish its own Berlin government. The three major non-Communist parties immediately called on their members to hold a mass protest rally at 3:00 PM to counter the Communist offensive against the government. The rally was held in Republic Square in front of the former German Reichstag building, a stone's throw from the Soviet zone. The German Communist Party's pseudo-city council in Berlin established a ten-member committee and passed a request to be submitted to Acting Mayor Ferdinandsberg, including "a unified city government under Communist control."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 26th] Well-informed people here are quite fearful of this major Communist demonstration in Berlin, believing that this move may lead to the Communists demanding power in the Berlin city government. Communist leader Pieck declared at a party meeting this morning, "We are fighting for national and socialist goals, and the Soviet occupation authorities will support us. Our struggle in Berlin is to guarantee Berlin's monetary and supply unification."</p>
<h3>Western Envoys Receive New Instructions, Will Visit the Kremlin Again; Deciding Germany's Future Political System is a Key Negotiating Point</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 26th, Radio Moscow: Western powers' envoys have received new instructions from their respective governments, preparing to participate in the next Kremlin meeting, and are waiting for news from the Kremlin. It is generally expected that the next meeting will take place on the night of the 26th, but the 27th seems more likely. Western envoys have clarified some doubts that arose after the meeting with Stalin on Monday night, and are now in complete agreement on the attitude to be taken in the next meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] It is reported that the Western countries have agreed to the Soviet Union's currency demands, but with one caveat: that the Soviet mark in Berlin should be controlled by the four powers. According to authoritative sources here, the Western countries have suggested to Stalin that the Berlin currency issue and other minor issues be handed over to the Berlin Four-Power Command for handling. The Soviet Union has not yet responded, but it is expected that the Soviet Union is "very likely to accept."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th] Diplomatic circles here point out that the key issues in the current Moscow meeting are: (1) Whether Germany's future political system should be divided or unified; (2) Whether communist ideology should be allowed to spread back to Western Europe, reaching the French border, or should be confined to its current territory. The Anglo-Soviet talks began at the end of July and are still in the first stage, the purpose of which is to discuss how to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to decide on Germany's final political system. One of the basic conditions of the negotiations is how to reach an agreement on the German monetary system. In addition, Stalin demanded that the reorganization of the West German states and the establishment of a West German government by the Western powers, as stipulated in the London Agreement, should be suspended when the four-power foreign ministers' meeting is reopened, because the Soviet Union believes that the newly established West German government is a military base that will eventually become a springboard for attacking the Soviet Union. For the Western Allies, there is currently no problem in suspending the organization of the West German government, as the future foreign ministers' meeting will discuss the entire German political system. However, if a unified German government is established, even if it is a federal government, Berlin must be the capital.</p>
<h3>West German States Elect Representatives to the Constitutional Assembly</h3>

<h3>Mrs. Kasenkina Dissatisfied with the Soviet Regime; Complains to Reporters that She Jumped Out of a Window to Escape the Soviet Consulate</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 25th] Mrs. Kasenkina gave her first interview to the press on the 25th since her dramatic window jump from the Soviet consulate. She was quite tired as she answered questions from her hospital bed at Roosevelt Hospital, breathing heavily with beads of sweat on her brow.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service New York, 25th] Russian émigré teacher Mrs. Kasenkina stated to the press today that she jumped from the fourth floor of the Soviet Consulate to avoid being sent back to the Soviet Union. She declared, "I did not intend to commit suicide, I only wanted to escape." She is currently being treated for her injuries at Roosevelt Hospital, and three reporters went to interview her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kasenkina's account of what happened is completely different from that of Soviet Consul General Lomakin. She said that she went to the Tolstoy Foundation farm of her own volition, while Lomakin claimed that he "rescued" her. She said, "When Lomakin and his group sent me back to the consulate, I knew that if they did not allow me to leave, then I would not be able to escape after going to Moscow. Therefore, I jumped out of the window, intending to escape." When reporters asked when she decided that she did not want to return to the Soviet Union, she said, "When I was still in Russia, I felt that if I could reach America, then I would not have to return to Russia. The reason why I wanted to escape was because in 1937, they took my husband away, and I don't know where he is. He has disappeared." She also said that her son died in the Battle of Leningrad in 1942. She said, "My son is a student, and my husband and I are both teachers." Some asked Mrs. Kasenkina about one point, namely what Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin discussed with her at the consulate after Lomakin took her away from the Tolstoy Foundation farm. She said, "I thought that the people in the consulate seemed to have a kind heart on the surface and were willing to talk to me, but he (Panyushkin) said that he didn't bother to talk to me, but I would go downstairs to meet the reporters. Panyushkin and Lomakin both told me what to say to the reporters, and told me that through this interview, I would become a heroine. This was on August 7th, the day Lomakin announced that he had 'rescued' her from the kidnappers from the 'White Russian Guards.'" Mrs. Kasenkina remained in the consulate until the day she jumped out of the window on August 12th. She made it clear that she wanted to leave the consulate and terminate her affiliation with the school for the children of Soviet diplomats at the United Nations. She said that she had told the Consul General that during the two years she had lived in the United States, she had become increasingly dissatisfied with the lives of Soviet citizens. She said, "I love my people and our homeland, but I cannot agree with the Soviet regime." During the twenty minutes that Mrs. Kasenkina was interviewed by the press, one lawyer, two doctors, and one New York City police officer were present as witnesses. At the same time, there were several newsreel cameramen and a Russian translator. Mrs. Kasenkina appeared exhausted, but at the end of the interview, she repeatedly expressed her gratitude to the reporters, New York police, and hospital staff.</p>

One asked: "Where are you coming from?" He answered: "From LaGuardia Airport." There were three people traveling with him.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] The United States insisted on its accusation that the behavior of some Soviet diplomats was "extremely improper." President Truman officially revoked the credential of Soviet Consul General in New York Lomakin, who became the center of the U.S.-Soviet diplomatic dispute.

<h3>Two Powers Compete for Vacuum; War Crisis Lurks; Dulles Discusses World Problems</h3>
<p>[United Press Amsterdam, 25th] Republican foreign policy planner John Foster Dulles told a press conference on the 25th that the current world crisis stems from the competition of existing powers to fill the vacuum created by the destruction or weakening of the six major powers in World War II. Dulles was unwilling to predict the possibility of war, only reiterating what he had said at the secret meeting of the International Affairs Committee of the World Council of Churches. He said that the destruction of Germany, Italy, and Japan, which are no longer world powers, and the weakening of China, Britain, and France have created a vacuum, and the process of filling this vacuum is a "competition and pressure." The question now is how this can proceed peacefully. Dulles spoke of the "moral vacuum" today, saying that "I believe the main task of the General Assembly is to create moral and spiritual strength." The current task is to buy time to work out a long-term plan to maintain world order. He hopes that the General Assembly will guide Christians everywhere, including in the Soviet Union.</p>

It is also expected that Kim Il-sung will be elected as the first president of the new government. In his election speech, Kim Il-sung referred to South Korean President Syngman Rhee, who is supported by the United States, as a traitor.

<h3>Subsidiary Coins Supplied by National Bank; Businesses Prohibited from Issuing Substitute Coupons</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, there has been a very enthusiastic response from various parties requesting to exchange Legal Tender, gold, silver, and foreign currencies. Therefore, they are already generally circulating in the market. However, there is still a lack of subsidiary currency certificates. It is learned that the Central Bank, in order to meet social needs, has already prepared a large number of subsidiary currency certificates for exchange. If banks, money shops, and people from the industrial and commercial sectors have needs, they can directly apply to the Business and Issuance Bureaus of the Central Bank for exchange. However, fractional currency has not yet arrived in large quantities. Various parties can still use 30,000 Legal Tender to offset one fen when making change. It has been rumored that some businesses and companies have arbitrarily issued substitute coupons, which is a sign of contempt for the law and a disruption of the currency system. Once verified, the relevant authorities will severely punish them according to the law in order to prevent currency outflow.</p>
<h3>Unified Economic Inspection Work Under the Command of Chiang Ching-kuo; To Be Generally Implemented Starting Today; Illegal Businesses Will Have Licenses Revoked and Be Dealt with According to the Law; Market Idle Funds Will Be Diverted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo, Deputy Supervisor of Economic Control in the Shanghai area, held an emergency meeting at the Central Bank yesterday morning. Those attending included Yu Shuping, Lin Chongyong, Zhang Yongnian, etc. It was resolved that in order to stabilize prices, all units under military, police, and economic control will jointly conduct a comprehensive inspection of all warehouses and markets starting today, and closely monitor major land and water transportation routes to strictly prohibit the unauthorized movement of materials. In order to strengthen the efficiency of inspections, it was decided that: (1) the inspection agencies will be unified. From now on, inspection work will be directed and uniformly implemented by Chiang Ching-kuo, and no longer conducted individually by various military and police agencies. It is believed that after the inspection agencies are unified, they can exert full force, but with the principle of not disturbing the people. (2) All merchants in the city who abide by national laws and do not hoard or manipulate the market will be guaranteed by law. (3) All businesses that violate national laws and various provisions of emergency economic measures will have their licenses revoked, and the persons in charge will be sent to the Special Criminal Court for legal action, and the goods will be confiscated. The above resolution will be generally implemented starting today. Chiang also stated that although market idle funds have increased due to the government's redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, the government will divert them by issuing Gold Yuan public bonds and other methods to ensure that they do not affect price stability. The government will also control materials in production areas and make comprehensive adjustments based on the needs of various regions. Therefore, although strict price limits have reduced market transactions, there is no risk of a shortage of supplies in cities.</p>

<h3>Cruel and Unusual: Robbery and Murder; Thief Li Renjin Sentenced to Death; Estranged Wife Weeps Upon Hearing the Verdict</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Special Criminal Court sentenced a thief, Li Renjin, to death yesterday for robbery and murder. Li's wife, Wang Sanmei, was also in court. Although the couple had separated, she couldn't help but cry when she heard the verdict, and her face changed drastically. Li was from Haizhou, 29 years old, and did not engage in proper work. After coming to Shanghai this year, he often quarreled with his wife, Wang Sanmei, so he stayed with his sister-in-law, Xu Xiaomei, at No. 16, Lane 297, Guangxi Road, working as a shoe shiner. However, his income was meager and insufficient to maintain his livelihood. Seeing that the occupants of the back room, Lai Guoqing and his wife Lai Zhangyinji, were dressed fashionably, he became malicious. On the 7th of last month, he first stole a small sharp knife for peeling water chestnuts from a stall vendor on Yunnan Road and hid it on his body, intending to wait for an opportunity to strike. At 6 a.m. on the 8th, while the Lai couple was fast asleep, Li secretly took the sharp knife and climbed into Lai's bedroom through the window, intending to steal the watch Lai was wearing on his wrist. Lai suddenly woke up and shouted loudly, and his wife also got up to resist, hugging the defendant. Li then stabbed the Lai couple wildly with the sharp knife, resulting in Lai being stabbed three times and his wife being stabbed seven times, all in vital areas such as the chest and abdomen. Li was then able to struggle and escape. At that time, Lai chased him to the door, but due to the severity of his injuries, he was unable to run any further. After returning to the room, he was sent to Renji Hospital, where he died. Lai's wife was four months pregnant, and the fetus in her womb was also tragically killed. After being admitted to the hospital, the dead fetus was removed by the hospital, but she herself is likely to be disabled. After committing the crime, Li knew that he could not stay safely in Shanghai, so he fled to Changshu. After being introduced, he was sold as a strong laborer, replacing someone in the Third Battalion, Ninth Company, First Platoon of the Jiangsu Security Regiment as a private first class. However, the Municipal Police局 obtained clues after the incident and arrested him in Zhitang Town, Changshu. He was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial on the charge of robbery and murder. In court yesterday, it was stated that although Li did not succeed in his robbery, his cruelty and ruthlessness were extraordinary and unforgivable. Therefore, he was convicted of "robbery and intentional homicide, sentenced to death, and deprived of political rights for life." Finally, the court instructed the defendant that if he disagreed with this verdict, he could file an application for retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment.</p>

<h3>Arson and Destruction of Pawnshop Case: Lu Zimei Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Leniency Granted for Repentance and Surrender After the Crime</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Lu Zimei, a clerk at the Qiaoxing Pawnshop on Fuxing Middle Road in this city, demanded an increase in severance pay from his employer without success. Out of resentment, he set fire to the pawnshop, resulting in the deaths of five people, including the assistant manager, Gao Jianqing. The District Court yesterday sentenced the defendant Lu Zimei to life imprisonment for arson and murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The reasons: (1) Although the deaths of the victims were caused by the defendant's act of arson, the defendant did not intend to kill them, and is only liable for negligent homicide according to law. (2) Even if the defendant did not intentionally cause the death of the victims, it was not contrary to the defendant's original intention. This kind of uncertain intention of consequence belongs to indirect intent under Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. (3) The killing of five people constitutes multiple crimes committed by one act. (4) The defendant voluntarily surrendered to the authorities and showed remorse after the crime, and leniency was granted in the sentencing.</p>
<h3>Figures for the Exchange of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Break Past Records Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The total value of gold, silver, and banknotes exchanged yesterday reached 10,231,304.57 gold yuan, breaking the previous day's record by a difference of 15,000 gold yuan. This included 32,585.546 taels of gold, 787,498.28 US dollars, 25,116.990 taels of silver, 86,263 silver dollars, and 421,767.05 Hong Kong dollars. Compared to the second day, the number of US dollars received decreased slightly, but there was a significant increase in gold and silver dollars. Today is Confucius' birthday, and financial institutions are closed for the holiday, so exchange activities will also be suspended for one day.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of inspecting the fineness of gold in this exchange, gold is rubbed on a "touchstone," and specialized personnel with experience in identifying gold fineness visually assess the gold content on the stone. This is then confirmed with a "gold comparison card." The procedure is extremely thorough. After the gold fineness is determined, a "gold and silver slip" is issued to the exchanger, stating "exchange weight in market taels," "fineness," "pure gold content," "exchange rate," and "equivalent gold yuan." If the exchanger disagrees with the determined fineness, they can still withdraw the original gold for re-inspection based on the original slip to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Theater Ticket Prices Agreed Upon; First-Run Theaters Set to Decrease</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Chinese and Western Film Theaters held a meeting at the Film Industry Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the revision of ticket prices after the currency reform. The resulting proposed ticket prices are as follows: First-run theaters: minimum 4 jiao gold yuan, followed by 8 jiao, 1 yuan 2 jiao, and a maximum of 1 yuan 6 jiao. Second-run theaters: minimum 2 jiao gold yuan, followed by 4 jiao, 6 jiao, and a maximum of 8 jiao. Third-run theaters: 1 jiao 5 fen, 2 jiao 5 fen, and 4 jiao. In addition to changing the ticket prices to gold yuan, adjustments will also be made to the tier of each theater. Due to the special circumstances after the war, some theaters that were originally second or third-run theaters joined the ranks of first-run theaters simply by obtaining the premiere rights to films. However, with repeated increases in ticket prices, they have found it difficult to maintain operations due to declining business. These theaters will voluntarily withdraw from the first run, and the Film Industry Association will also review the equipment and location of each theater. It is therefore expected that the number of first-run theaters will decrease significantly. These adjustments to ticket prices and tiers are still subject to procedural formalities and reporting to the Bureau of Social Affairs and are expected to be implemented starting next week.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Issues Orders: Strictly Enforce Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, under Yu Shuping, yesterday issued an order stating: "The success or failure of economic control policies is related to the fate of the nation and the people. Police officers of this bureau should concentrate all their efforts and work together to achieve success. In addition to explaining the recently issued economic control laws and regulations of the central government in detail to their subordinates and supervising their implementation, the heads of each unit must also promptly report and investigate illegal activities related to black market trading in gold and banknotes and the hoarding of materials for speculation, in order to impose sanctions. All levels of police officers must take this as their most urgent and central task at present and must not slacken in the slightest, lest they be severely investigated."</p>
<p>Although today is a holiday, the police economic patrol brigade has been ordered to patrol various commercial markets and randomly inspect the retail prices of companies and stores.</p>
<h3>Air Freight Rates for Goods, Mail, and Newspapers Ordered to be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] China and Central Aviation Companies yesterday received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications ordering that, in order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures and assist the government in stabilizing prices, the 85% increase in freight rates approved for the two companies from the 20th of this month for mail, newspapers, and ordinary goods carried by flights should be reduced from today (the 27th), restoring the original prices before the 20th. Because mail is used by the vast majority of the public, newspapers are related to the circulation of national culture, and ordinary goods are closely related to regulating materials in various regions and stabilizing prices, these must all be given reductions. As for passenger tickets and the freight rates for valuable items, the increase will be maintained. This wise measure by the Ministry of Communications, at a time when national economic reforms are being implemented, is a pioneer in leading price reductions by public utilities and transportation services. However, the two airlines, whose financial revenues and expenditures are already unbalanced, have been ordered by the Ministry</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Appraisal Committee Passes: Standards for Calculating Employee Wages; Calculated According to the Discounted Base Salary Based on This Month's Index; Salaries Paid Twice a Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The 21st meeting of the Shanghai Labor-Management Appraisal Committee was held at the Bureau of Social Affairs meeting room yesterday afternoon.

The main topic of discussion at yesterday's meeting was how to calculate the gold yuan equivalent of wages after the currency reform. The committee members debated fiercely, and as a result, the "Standards for Calculating the Gold Yuan Equivalent of Employee Wages in Various Industries in Shanghai in August" were passed. The standards are divided into four items:</p>
<p>(1) The salaries of employees in various industries shall be calculated based on their original discounted base salary, with reference to the upper period living index for August as the highest standard, to determine the gold yuan equivalent of the earned legal tender discount. If there is a dispute, it shall be reviewed and handled by the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>(2) Workers' wages should be based on a monthly, daily, or piece-rate standard. Overtime pay and income from processing shall not be converted into wages.</p>
<p>(3) If there are other subsidies agreed upon by various industries, they shall still follow the agreement, but they shall not be converted into wages.</p>
<p>(4) Salaries shall be paid twice a month, in mid-month and at the end of the month, with the interval not exceeding five days. Those with established customs shall continue to follow their customs.</p>
<p>In addition, mobile odd-job workers in the water and electricity installation industry requested the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee to abolish the method of progressive discounts on base salaries. This was rejected by the Committee yesterday: It was handled according to the decision of the 13th meeting of the Committee. (That is, the application was rejected.)</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Wide-Ranging Talk: Entertaining Reporters in "Children's Paradise," Discussing Kuling Construction and Currency Reform</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Tongqu</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling to This Newspaper, 24th] Kuling has been shrouded in continuous rain and thick fog. The weather turned bad the day after the President went down the mountain, and it lasted for six consecutive days. On the afternoon of the 24th, the rain stopped, the fog dissipated, and the clouds floated in the sky with the sun appearing and disappearing intermittently. People suffocated by the fog finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Rainy days make Kuling boring. News reporters had no one to interview, so they racked their brains for ideas. First, they asked Wang Zuomin, the director of the Administration Bureau, to tell Madame President if she could find time to entertain the reporters for a casual chat, but nothing came of it. At noon on the 24th, a jointly signed request letter was sent to the official residence.</p>
<p>On the street, reporters were wandering around, looking for interview subjects. Madame Chiang strolled over, with her secretary and attendants following behind. Upon encountering the group of reporters, Madame Chiang immediately thought of the case and said to Wang Zuomin, "How about inviting them to visit the Children's Paradise together and chat for a while?"</p>
<p>This turned into an unexpected opportunity. A simple press conference was held in the Children's Paradise—this was the first time Madame President had entertained reporters.</p>
<p>Madame Loves Orphan Girls, Witty Remarks Elicit Laughter</p>
<p>Fourteen orphaned girls, raised by Director Hu, have grown up and received special love from Madame President. Madame Chiang herself said that every time she comes to Kuling, she either invites them to the official residence to play or comes to see them. This year, she came in person, donated five shi (approximately 500 kg) of rice, brought many snacks, had them sing a song, and then personally distributed fruit and cakes to them. During this break, Madame Chiang met with the group of reporters.</p>
<p>Without taking off her coat and headscarf, Madame Chiang sat calmly on a wicker chair in the corner, facing the group of reporters: "What do you want to ask?" The conversation started from the orphans. Madame Chiang said, "They are all girls abandoned by their parents, which shows that society values men over women." A reporter immediately chimed in, "They have received Madame's care, but isn't that favoring women over men?" A burst of laughter erupted.</p>
<p>Talking about her stay in Kuling, Madame Chiang said she had rarely been out due to the continuous rain and fog. She said, "I am preparing to go down the mountain." "Is the President not coming?" "He is too busy, I am afraid he cannot come." The official residence on Huangpu Road in Nanjing is still under renovation. Madame Chiang said, "After returning to Nanjing, I am afraid I will still live in the Song Mansion in Beijige." A reporter asked, "What is Madame's impression of Kuling's construction?" "It seems that the streets are very clean. Construction requires everyone's help; relying on one director is not enough, especially you news reporters, who should provide more assistance."</p>
<p>The children sitting on the floor eating fruit and cake were looking at this strange group of guests. Madame Chiang turned around and said, "How about singing a song for the guests?" So Director Hu played the organ, and they sang a song together. Madame Chiang personally handed the cake plate to the oldest child and asked her to take everyone out to play.</p>
<p>Not Fully Supporting the New Currency Will Only Cause Suffering for the People; The reception continued, but the questions turned serious. A reporter asked, "After the currency reform, if the economy stabilizes and there are no military problems, do the President and Madame intend to travel abroad?" This question seemed to make Madame Chiang a little embarrassed. After hesitating slightly, she said, "I don't know. I cannot answer this question."</p>
<p>However, the issue of currency reform sparked Madame Chiang's opinion. She said, "Whether the economy will stabilize after the currency reform depends on whether the people have confidence and wholeheartedly support it." She pointed out that the eight-year war against Japan was finally won because the people of the whole country were united. "If the people have no confidence and do not fully support the new currency system, in the end, the people themselves will suffer."</p>
<p>Persuasion is Better Than Force; Encouraging Wealthy Households to Donate Quickly</p>
<p>Madame Chiang has many British and American friends and pays special attention to European and American public opinion. The reporters used this as a topic to ask Madame Chiang for her opinion. Madame Chiang said: "Democracy can tolerate criticism. However, democracy is not about transplanting foreign things to China. China has its own democracy." Regarding American aid, Madame Chiang believes that one cannot rely entirely on aid from friendly countries but must rely on self-reliance. A reporter raised the issue of "powerful family capital." Madame Chiang seemed a little excited and said, "Powerful family capital is a slogan shouted by the Communist Party." She believes that wealthy people should be made to take out money. The government can stipulate heavy taxes but cannot "extort." "What if they don't take it out without extortion?" Madame Chiang's view is: "People all have a conscience. Persuasion is better than force." She believes that as long as the persuasion is done properly, the wealthy can be moved to take out money. Then, from the women's movement to the peasant problem, Madame Chiang explained that the National Women's Movement Committee has never stopped working since the war of resistance, but it has done more practical work and less publicity. In the future, this deficiency should also be made up, and efforts should be put into publicity. The problem is that there are few funds. The Women's Movement Committee is also a social organization and has no fixed funds, so it is very difficult to do things. She advocates that all work should go to the countryside in the future. Since farmers contribute money and labor, their lives should be improved. Madame Chiang said that students, in particular, should go to the countryside.</p>
<p>Impression of Reporters; Believing They are the Pioneers of the Nation</p>
<p>The questions turned to the news reporters themselves. "What is Madame's impression of news reporters? Have reporters made progress since the war of resistance?"</p>
<p>"Very obvious," Madame Chiang said affirmatively. "If I didn't think you reporters were promising young people, I wouldn't have spent this time talking to you today." She said that she had also been a news reporter. She believes that news reporters are the pioneers of the nation. They must record accurately, pay attention to major events, and not pay too much attention to trivial matters. They should play a leading role in society, especially by setting an example and paying attention to their words and deeds.</p>
<p>The conversation lasted about forty minutes. Madame Chiang was always calm in her answers, kind and amiable, and her smile never left her lips, giving people a very friendly impression. She stood up amid the reporters' thanks, shook hands with each of them, and said goodbye.</p>
<p>On the way back, Madame Chiang still walked. Our photographer rushed over, and with a flash of light, Madame Chiang's smile was captured in the lens. Madame Chiang looked and realized it was a familiar photographer:</p>
<p>"You are still here..."</p>
<p>"I am with Shen Bao now."</p>
<p>"Shen Bao," Madame Chiang smiled and nodded. Dusk spread, and thick fog swooped down from the mountains again, all the way until Madame Chiang walked back to the official residence on Hedong Road.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Wujin to This Newspaper, 25th] Xu Sanlin, a resident of Xingxian Lane, Juqian Street in the city, was a former secret agent. After the victory, he was idle and had fanciful ideas. He conspired with accomplices Wu Jinda, Zhu Yuzhen, Zhu Xiyu, and others to privately make counterfeit money. They made various preparations and pooled funds at 400 million per share to rent a machine and cast plates. The printing site was set up at the home of Zhu Jiji, father of Zhu Jiangzhen, in Zhujia Village, Daqiao Yi, Beixiang. Printing, sales, and material procurement were handled separately. They printed counterfeit red 2,000-yuan Guanjin notes from 1937, spending 24 days and using three reams of Peach Forest paper to print 4.8 billion. From the 19th of this month, they became popular in the Xiaoxinqiao Panshu area. The paper quality was smooth, and the patterns were rough, making it easy to distinguish the authenticity.

<h3>Securities Brokers Association Holds Meeting; Decides to Stop Trading on Behalf of Customers; Hopes the Authorities Will Approve Resumption of Business Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Securities Brokers Association of this city held a temporary members' meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. A total of more than 190 member representatives attended. Chairman Wang Naixu presided over the meeting, which adjourned at 4:30 PM. Two resolutions were passed: (1) During the period when the securities exchange is ordered to suspend business, all brokers should stop trading on behalf of customers. Trading will resume after the securities exchange resumes business. (2) Request the securities exchange authorities to submit a report to the government authorities as soon as possible to resume the securities exchange business.</p>
<p>Wang Naixu, the chairman of the Brokers Association, told reporters after the meeting: "The brokers' own position has always been pure. Brokers have always strictly complied with the laws and regulations and assisted the government in promoting economic policies in previous economic measures. For example, during the last suspension of trading, brokers complied with the order and smoothly cleared all completed transactions. Before the securities exchange was ordered to suspend business this time, the brokers had an outstanding balance of 100 trillion yuan for various transactions, but they also smoothly cleared them. This shows that brokers have always cooperated with the government. Therefore, after the government issued the order to suspend the securities exchange this time, the association's position, in addition to requesting all brokers to temporarily stop trading on behalf of customers, still hopes that the government can resume the securities exchange business as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After the currency is stabilized, there should be appropriate guidance for the floating capital in the market so that it can be brought into the right track. After the securities exchange is suspended, the 213 brokers and the hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly related to the industry are greatly affected, and the general factories and companies cannot raise funds. It is believed that after the resumption of the securities exchange business, it will be able to build a bridge for the floating capital in the market and guide it towards the path of production."</p>
<h3>Prices Stable at Production Sites, Sales Sluggish; Rice Prices Hover at Low Levels; Oil Market's Ban on Exports Makes People Nervous</h3>
<p>The rice market is sluggish because of sluggish sales. The weather is sunny, arrivals are continuous, and more new indica rice is entering the market. Prices are stable at the production sites, and importers are weak-willed. Sales are very slow. Initial prices are similar, but later there is a drop of two to five jiao. White japonica rice in the south enters below 19 yuan, and thin paddy rice leaves the station at 20 yuan. However, it turned firm slightly at the close. Thin paddy rice in the north market is even, special high japonica rice sales are weak, falling five jiao, and trading at 21 yuan. Today is Confucius's birthday, and the market is closed for one day. Yesterday's arrivals were 3,940 shi.</p>
<p>Flour: Because the factory has not yet opened, the stock in the market is decreasing day by day. Holders are taking advantage of the shortage to report higher prices. The market was still even at the opening yesterday, but prices rose in the active market. Lao Chong opened at 7 yuan and 4 jiao and rose to 7 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 fen at the close. Bingshun rose from 7 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen to 7 yuan and 2 jiao. The former rose by 1 jiao, and the latter rose by 5 fen. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and increased by one jiao and one jiao two fen, and miscellaneous brands of flour also slightly increased by five fen, while others remained stable. Bran has very little trading, and prices are rarely up or down.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Stable, mostly traded according to the limit price. People are nervous about soybeans due to the export ban, and the supply of samples has increased slightly, but prices are still at the original level. Hankou Zhadou opened at ten yuan. Green beans are firmer. Qingdao Bang of corn is handled as usual, and prices are stable. Yuanmai is only being taken by Shantou Bang, with prices cut by seven jiao to one yuan. Broad beans are sold retail in this street, and prices are increased by two jiao. Peas are quiet. Although sesame is banned from export, sales are still good in this street, and prices are stable. Shengren is needed by the Guang Bang and is still traded at the limit price.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Due to the ban on exports and restrictions on transit, people are bearish. Importers are eating at very low prices, but because the stock is not abundant and soybean prices are not cheap, cargo owners are not soft-hearted. Therefore, although there has been a slight decline, it is stable in fatigue. Dayou soybean oil traded at 51 yuan, and the rest traded at 50 yuan, a slight decrease of five jiao to one yuan five jiao. Due to the high price the previous day, raw oil fell by two yuan. Jilu raw oil did not open until the close at 62 yuan. Rapeseed oil was down five jiao to one yuan. Only the small car rattan oil of the Ke Bang was handled, up one yuan. Shantou Bang saw the low price of soybean cake and took it, continuing to rise by one jiao to two jiao.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yi Huai Wheel, loaded with 1,973 tons of rice from Bangkok, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at the Huangpu Wharf for unloading. Haiyu Wheel, also loaded with 8,369 tons of rice from Bangkok, is expected to arrive at Wusongkou last night and can be imported this morning, docking at the third or second wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>After revealing a glimmer of dawn a few days ago, the foreign tea market ultimately remained unenthusiastic because sellers remained firm and exporters' demand was not urgent. In terms of prices, they remain stable, lacking any fluctuations. It has been heard that Xinhua, Wuchang, and other tea companies have wired overseas to solicit business for Luzhuang Wenzhou Zhenmei, but whether they will be successful is still being brewed.

<h3>Banks and Bureaus Turning Out More Than In; Monetary Market Still Extremely Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the monetary market in this city was exceptionally loose.

<h3>This Week's Export Exchange Settlement: Figures Decrease Compared to Previous Week</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This week's exchange settlement figures for exported goods in Shanghai amounted to US$2,401,784.63, less than half of last week's total. The reason is that all banks were ordered to close from Friday this week to handle currency system reform and account reconciliation.</p>
<p>This total exchange settlement amount includes US$838,677.99 for exported yarn, cloth, mineral ores, and other items under government control and support. If categorized by commodity type, the figures are as follows: US$250,039.44 for hog bristles, US$550,336.14 for tung oil, US$713.75 for hides and furs, US$68,896.75 for vegetable oils, US$70,767.51 for tea, US$86,827.88 for straw hats, US$25,023.95 for hog casings, US$6,200.95 for feathers, US$18,379.94 for metals and their products, US$2,178.55 for wool and raw silk, US$72,410.21 for eggs, US$68,782.31 for cotton textiles, US$19,959.94 for wool, US$164,745.22 for silk fabrics, US$22,425.13 for vegetables and their products, US$135,418.97 for sundries, US$295,938.98 for cotton cloth, US$9,000.00 for cotton yarn, and US$533,739.01 for mineral ores.</p>
<h3>National Banks Prepare to Supply Subsidiary Currency; Unauthorized Issuance of Vouchers Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates, requests for exchange with legal tender, gold, silver, and foreign currencies have been very enthusiastic, and they are now widely circulating in the market. However, there is still a shortage of subsidiary currency and notes. It is now known that the Central Bank, in order to meet social needs, has long prepared a large quantity of subsidiary currency to meet the needs of exchange. If banks, money houses, and commercial and industrial entities have any needs, they may directly apply to the Central Bank's Business and Issuance Bureaus for exchange. However, since fractional currency has not yet arrived in large quantities, change can still be given at the rate of 30,000 legal tender to 1 fen. It has been rumored that some firms and companies have been issuing substitute vouchers without authorization, which is a blatant disregard for the law and undermines the currency system. Once verified, they will be severely punished according to law to prevent malpractices.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning in the silk market, prices rose to the limit. Da Cheng Silk Shop opened at 628 yuan and rose to the limit of 636.6 yuan before closing, immediately announcing an early market closure.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of medicinal materials were average. Elephant shell gradually sold off, but the loose market closed even with the previous day. Branch Scutellaria returned to its original price, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>New prices for industrial oils mostly followed the "August 19" market quotations, but transactions remained scarce. Prices in the production areas were still being negotiated, and few goods arrived. Dealers suffered losses, and customer orders were virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Market Conditions: (1) The cost of goods arriving in Shanghai from Hankou was 76 yuan, plus interest, it was over 80 yuan. (2) Small-scale traders, through public discussion, decided that Shen Yuan Lai, Heng He, and Da Lai Trading Companies would each allocate 100 loads, priced at 70 yuan per load. (3) The actual new opening price is likely to be around 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Slight Fluctuations in the Yarn Market; Cotton Cloth Demand Exceeds Supply, Initially Weak but Subsequently Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market condition: Due to the restriction on southward transportation, the Textile Construction Company continued to allocate sales, and the listed prices were also lower than the market values (including four types such as 20-count Great Flying Shuttle), so people's confidence gradually waned. Police and security teams were dispatched to supervise the scene, which was strictly enforced, so trading of spot yarn was still limited. Those who needed it in the Japanese Quarter could directly purchase it from the Textile Construction Company. The number of buyers on the floor decreased, and the number of sellers increased. Transactions were mainly in 32-count Xiantao, Jinyu, 20-count Jincheng, Golden Double Lions, Red Bee, Flying Horse, 10-count Mingbao Star, and Siping Lotus, a total of seven or eight categories. The prices were slightly lower than the limit prices. Re-processors entered the market when prices were low. There were thirteen transactions, totaling forty-two pieces.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions: At the beginning, due to the ban on southward transportation of yarn and cloth, and rumors that the authorities would thoroughly investigate the books, people panicked, and many sellers rushed to sell, resulting in flat and weak prices. Later, due to the extraordinary abundance of silver, cloth merchants and Tianjin and Yangtze merchants stationed in Shanghai competed to buy, resulting in a state where demand exceeded supply. All goods lingered at high prices, and transactions were concluded in accordance with the "August 19" limit prices. However, on-site supervision was still strict, and no one dared to openly call out prices. In order to suppress the rising trend, the Textile Construction Company was entrusted to sell off large quantities at 10:20 AM. This time, the bidding system was officially abandoned, and the Textile Construction Company set the prices.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth: 29.3 yuan per bolt; Four Gentlemen Yuan Straight Tribute: 29.8 yuan; Jumping Carp Yuan Serge: 25 yuan; Bleached Cloth: 28.5 yuan; Four Gentlemen Yuan Color Mercerized Cloth: 33 yuan; and Colored Floral Bed Sheets: 4.7 yuan each, totaling fourteen types.</p>
<p>Upon verification, there were 20 factories, totaling 1,400 bolts of cotton cloth; 872 cloth shops, totaling 36,680 bolts of cotton cloth and 590 bed sheets. 1,072,935 Gold Yuan was recovered. Trading on the floor closed early. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth closed at 29.5 yuan, slightly better than the previous day, and even with the August 19 legal tender price of 8,850,000 yuan. A total of 1,060 bolts were traded throughout the day.</p>

<p>Special Broadcast: In addition, in order to promote Confucianism and the spirit of mutual assistance, the Confucius Society has launched a 10,000 yuan gold scholarship movement.

<h3>Zhu Ziqing Memorial Service: Mei Yi-qi and Others Delivered Eulogies of Mourning</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Zhu Ziqing's memorial service was held at Tsinghua today. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, family members, relatives, friends, and classmates offered sacrifices in order. Mei Yi-qi delivered a eulogy, saying that Mr. Zhu's attitude was always selfless, humble, and enthusiastic. He did his utmost for the school. Unfortunately, he passed away just over fifty years old, before us, which is a great loss to us. He advised everyone to value their health and live a few more years for their work. Feng Youlan said: Mr. Zhu had a great influence on new literature, and we have lost a powerful partner. Poverty took his life. Lu Zhizhang, Yang Zhensheng, Ma Heng and others also offered sacrifices. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua sent a telegram of condolence. The funeral committee will build a clothing tomb for Mr. Zhu in the Western Hills.</p>
<h3>The Re-enrollment of Students from Henan and Shandong is Largely Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Education has exchanged preliminary views with the principals of secondary schools from the provinces of Shandong and Henan who fled to Nanjing regarding the re-enrollment of students from these provinces. A general agreement has been reached on selecting a site for re-establishment of schools and on establishing joint secondary schools by combining several schools. The Ministry of Education will comprehensively discuss and decide on this matter within two days and then hand it over to the educational administrative authorities of the two provinces for implementation. The Director of the Shandong Provincial Education Department is already in Nanjing and can implement it first. The head of the secondary school section sent by the Henan Provincial Education Department is ill, and the Henan Provincial Government is currently being reorganized. The newly appointed Director of the Education Department has not yet taken office. The execution of the re-enrollment plan determined by the Ministry of Education will inevitably be delayed. However, in consideration of the fact that the schools in Nanjing that students have been borrowing are about to start classes, the Ministry of Education intends to find other houses to gather students from Henan Province who need to return to their province in order to allow the schools in Nanjing to start classes.</p>
<h3>School Fees Can Be Decided Tomorrow: Municipal Primary School Principals Confer Yesterday on Fee Standards; Increasing Local Education Fees Is Necessary to Increase Schools and Add Classes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The fee standards for primary and secondary schools in the city have not yet been decided. The Municipal Education Bureau separately convened meetings of principals of public and private primary and secondary schools to hear their opinions. Director Li has compiled the figures proposed by the principals and the standards drafted by the Education Bureau and reported them to Mayor Wu. It is now known that Mayor Wu has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow afternoon to invite principals and teachers' representatives from various public and private primary and secondary schools, as well as councilors and other relevant parties to discuss and make a final decision.</p>
<p>Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau held a discussion meeting on municipal primary school fees at the Municipal He'an Primary School at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than one hundred principals attended, and the discussion was presided over by Director Li, Chief Zhu of the National Education Department, and Section Chief Lu. The principals spoke enthusiastically, lasting for three hours.</p>
<p>Education Association Demands: Representatives from the Municipal Primary School Teachers' Association also attended and requested: (1) Teachers' salaries should meet pre-war standards. (2) The salaries of municipal primary school teachers should not be lower than those of private primary school teachers, and should at least be equal, to avoid teacher turnover. (3) Continue to collect teacher training fees, similar to the last semester, accounting for about one-half of the total fees.</p>
<p>Director's Opinion: Director Li, in order to encourage schools to pay attention to physical education, specially stipulated that each student should pay one yuan for physical education this semester to enrich physical education equipment and strengthen physical education activities. In addition, Director Li suggested that other tuition, miscellaneous, and construction fees should not exceed ten yuan, that is, the total amount should not exceed eleven yuan. Some principals requested that the fee standard be eight yuan for teacher training fees, nine yuan and seven jiao for construction fees and miscellaneous fees, and one yuan for physical education fees, totaling eighteen yuan and seven jiao.</p>
<p>Adding Schools and Classes: The principals repeatedly mentioned the issue of adding schools and classes to accommodate students. Chief Zhu reported that the Education Bureau's plan to request the Municipal Government to add classes is being signed and submitted to the Mayor for review by the Municipal Government's Council Office and has not yet made a final decision. Director Li believes that the current municipal finances are indeed difficult. The fundamental solution is to hope that the Municipal Council can assist in raising local education funds to the constitutionally stipulated 35% of the municipal budget (currently 14%).</p>
<p>[Additional News] The Municipal Education Bureau will soon convene a discussion meeting of all national primary school principals in the city. Director Li instructed the principals yesterday that if they have any difficult problems, they can prepare in advance for discussion at the meeting. Mayor Wu will also be invited to attend and provide guidance.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 26th] It has been decided that public and private primary schools in Hangzhou will charge a total of two yuan for tuition and miscellaneous fees.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Unified Review Committee Issues Spoken Statement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee, and Li Ximou, Vice Chairman, issued a written statement yesterday stating: (1) Students of all levels of schools can apply for scholarships for this semester starting on September 1 of this year. At that time, each school can prepare a letter and send personnel to the committee to receive the application forms for distribution to students. (2) The deadline for students of all levels of schools to apply for scholarships for this semester is set at the end of September of this year. (3) When schools submit student scholarship application forms with a letter, they must attach a roster of free and public expense students for this semester, and a statistical table of the number of students in the entire school for this semester, otherwise they will not be reviewed. (4) In order to ensure that truly needy students receive more benefits, the number of scholarships for this semester may need to be reduced, but the amount of the scholarship that each needy student should receive will be appropriately increased; it is hoped that the school authorities will be earnestly responsible and strictly handle the preliminary review.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Confucius and Teachers Saving the Country: Minister of Education Zhu Writes and Publishes an Article on the Eve of Teachers' Day</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua published an article on the eve of this year's Teachers' Day entitled "Commemorating Confucius and Teachers Saving the Country." The content briefly stated: "Commemorating Confucius' Birthday: On the one hand, we commemorate Confucius' spirit of teaching without discrimination and being a teacher for all ages. On the other hand, we commemorate the arduous and continuous contributions of teachers at all levels across the country to national education. Confucius lived in the turbulent times of the late Zhou Dynasty, but he always maintained his compassionate heart and cried out to save the declining situation and bring the world to Great Harmony. This practical and solid spirit of turning the tide can make us imagine his painstaking efforts to worry about the times and save the world, and to defend the truth to the death. Today, the Communist bandits are rebelling, and the country is disturbed, which is an even worse environment than Confucius' time. Therefore, the great spirit of Confucius in helping the world and saving the people urgently needs to be promoted at present. During this period of suppression of rebellion, our national teachers should learn from Confucius to take benevolence as their responsibility and promote the spirit of eliminating chaos and restoring order; quell heresies and curb atrocities to save the people from misery. In particular, we should unite sincerely and work together under the national mobilization and rebellion suppression policy to engage in rebellion suppression work in education; make the education community itself the greatest stabilizing force in society. Today, commemorating Confucius' birthday and commemorating Teachers' Day, we must launch a teacher-saving-the-country movement." In conclusion, "Confucius never tired of learning and never tired of teaching. Of his three thousand disciples, seventy-two were proficient in the Six Arts. This spirit of patient instruction and teaching without discrimination can serve as a model for teachers across the country today. On the one hand, we should promote our country's inherent culture and cultivate the excellent moral character of young people; on the other hand, we should do our best to inspire young people's correct thinking of loving the country and the nation; to save China from its current crisis. In recent years, countless young students in the Northeast, North China, and various pacification zones have been displaced due to bandit disasters. And the Communist bandits' professional students have incited student unrest, causing the general student population to be poisoned and the country to suffer tangible and intangible damage. Our national teachers at all levels will certainly be able to assist the government, with one heart and one mind, to jointly save the serious crisis."</p>
<h3>He Haohua's Overturning Incident at the World Games Cycling Competition: A Special Report on the Tragedy at Herne Hill</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhong Zhen of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, London Airmail] Today, August 7 (Saturday), is the eighth day of the World Games. After the Chinese delegation's football team was miserably defeated, the basketball team also failed to enter the finals. Track and field and swimming had long been eliminated, so today's cycling competition at Herne Hill Park was undoubtedly the last hope for our Chinese team. Unexpectedly, during the competition, the bicycle ridden by our athlete He Haohua collided with the bicycle of a Belgian athlete about 50 yards from the finish line, and he was overturned. At a high speed of 60 miles per hour, he fell from the inclined cycling track, dislocating his left arm, fracturing his left collarbone, and breaking his skin on his hands and legs, bleeding profusely, a tragic sight. Fortunately, he was wearing a rubber helmet for protection, otherwise his skull would have been shattered and he would have died. All hope for our Chinese delegation was extinguished, which is regrettable. Mr. He Haohua also represented our country at the 12th World Games in Berlin in 1935. At that time, Mr. He was only 19 years old, and Mr. Lu Xiangqian, the current affairs officer, took care of him. Mr. He is a Dutch overseas student and runs a decoration company in the Netherlands. Because he could not speak Mandarin, there were rumors that his qualifications were in question, but it was proved that he was indeed of Chinese nationality, and there were no complications. Mr. He won the Dutch cycling championship in 1943. Last time in Berlin, he first encountered the world champion, and the difference was only a foot or so. Unexpectedly, this time he had an accident after the first competition, which is really unfortunate for our Chinese team. He had to abandon the 4,000-meter and long-distance races in pain.</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM on Saturday, August 7, the first cycling competition was held in Herne Hill Park in the southern suburbs of London. The first event was the 1,000-meter sprint. He Haohua was listed in the second group to compete against the Belgian Te Van Vliet. At the start, according to the cycling rules, the two cars need to run side by side in the first lap, slowly proceeding to the second lap, then competing at high speed. At the end of the first lap, Mr. He was behind the Belgian athlete because he started the car slower. Later, in the second half of the journey, he began to chase, and the difference between the two was only half a foot or so before reaching the finish line. At the end of the competition, Belgium won the championship with a time of two minutes and four seconds. But Mr. He still had a chance to compete in the 4,000-meter and long-distance competition. Unexpectedly, when passing the finish line, because the racing car had no brakes, it could not stop immediately. About 50 yards away on the slope, the front wheel of Mr. He's car collided with the rear wheel of Te Van Vliet's car, and the bicycle immediately overturned. Mr. He was thrown more than ten feet and rolled four or five times before landing in the grass. At that time, the surrounding audience shouted loudly. The tragic scene of the overturning is really indescribable. Our country's affairs officer and medical consultant Dr. Deng Bingming rushed into the field to rescue him. The reporter also entered the field with him. Mr. He was lying on a single bed, still conscious, tears streaming down his face. He shouted in English, "I can't contribute to the country." Officials from various countries in the field all knew that Mr. He was a famous European cyclist. Today, he suffered this tragedy, and everyone was deeply moved. It is also reported that the cause of this tragedy was a sudden tire leak. The reporter happily took pictures of the competition and returned disappointed, with endless regrets in his heart.</p>

<h3>Seduction, Murder, and Corpse Disposal: A Tragic Scene in the Human World</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Asks: In the East Street of Wusong Town lives a Mr. Wu from Zhenjiang, nearing his twilight years, working as a laborer in a certain institution in Wusong. He has a niece, a young woman of about eighteen, with some beauty. Mr. Wu, seeing her youth and vulnerability, seduced and violated her last year. Unexpectedly, she became pregnant and gave birth to a girl in July of this year. Her family, concerned about their reputation, strangled the child and threw it into the river at night, a cruel and inhuman act. I, a humble person, wish to report this crime but am unfamiliar with the law and unsure how to proceed. I have three questions for your guidance: (1) Can neighbors who are aware of the matter report it to the court? (2) What crime is committed by the person who strangled the child? (3) What crime is committed by Mr. Wu for seducing and violating his niece, and can others report it?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) Reporting is permissible. (2) Committing the crime of murder under criminal law. (3) Committing the crime of disrupting public morals under Article 228 of the criminal law, but it requires a formal accusation to be prosecuted.</p>

<h3>"Yes-Man"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qing</p>
<p>"Yes-Man" refers to a "Yes-man." Thirty years ago, when "vernacular novels" were just becoming popular, novels would invariably use "also" to represent the Chinese word "right" or "yes" when referring to Westerners speaking. Why the circumlocution? We younger generations have no way of knowing, but it was probably just a way to keep up with the times. Now, thinking of the name "Yes-Man" evokes a sense of historical reflection.</p>
<p>Since the three words "Yes-Man" were imported from abroad, it's conceivable that there must be many such people in foreign countries. For example, Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, has the nickname "City of Yes-Men." With the concentration of government offices, one naturally sees many clever people who are adept at handling all situations. If you say, "The weather is good today," they will certainly reply, "Absolutely fantastic weather!" Then they will laugh heartily, each satisfied. Such is the way of social interaction in officialdom; everyone knows what's going on in their hearts, but on the surface, they must always smile.</p>
<p>However, the most important use of the "Yes-Man's" constant "yes" is not in dealing with colleagues, but in serving superiors. They are not only good at observing facial expressions and going with the flow, but also extremely sensitive, always eager to agree enthusiastically but never actually taking action. Because taking action is easy to reveal flaws, with a fifty-fifty chance of doing well or poorly. If they happen to do poorly, and a smiling colleague reports them to the superior when the superior is in a bad mood, wouldn't their job be in jeopardy?</p>
<p>The wise "Yes-Man" knows the importance of their job, so they naturally won't take such risks.</p>
<p>However, it's not a pretty sight to have offices filled with smartly dressed officials, big and small, spending their days reading gossip magazines and talking about women. And "Yes-Men" place great importance on appearances. Therefore, they have devised a way to do things on the surface without actually doing anything: they allow official documents to travel at an extremely slow pace, with one person stamping a seal, another signing a name, until the travel time becomes too long, then they write "under review" and file it away.</p>
<p>The "Yes-Man" says that his approach is based on philosophy, called "governing by doing nothing." When a journalist interviews a newly appointed "Yes-Man," he also has a statement to make, saying "not seeking merit, but seeking to avoid mistakes." To avoid both merit and mistakes, it is of course best to "do nothing." However, doing absolutely nothing is also unacceptable, as there would be no response to questions from legislative bodies. Therefore, everyone does as little as possible, using financial difficulties as a convenient excuse. If something absolutely must be done, they strive to make it look "good" and easy to get reimbursed.</p>
<p>However, if I were to use a phrase from Han Feizi, I could say, "A Yes-Man is not always a Yes-Man." A true "Yes-Man" will naturally have times when he doesn't say "yes." He has rivals for favor, whom he must harm while maintaining a pleasant demeanor; and the most troublesome thing is that there still seem to be clueless fools in the world who want to be good officials who follow the rules. What to do?</p>
<p>Thus, the practice of forming cliques and engaging in private dealings flourishes.</p>
<p>"Yes-Men" not only say "yes," but also "get yes-ed." For example, if the "Yes-Minister" gets angry, he will go and scold the "Yes-Director." The "Yes-Director" will certainly listen respectfully, then say, "Yes, I deserve to die!" Going back, he will scold the "Yes-Chief." After the chief respectfully hears everything, he admits mistake and says "yes," then goes back and scolds the "Yes-Head." The Head does the same thing. And it will continue until it reaches a miserable clerk. After the clerk gets home, he scolds his wife and beats his son.</p>
<p>What about that son? After being beaten, he may secretly spit on the ground and mutter, "Damn it!"</p>
<p>That's how it is. When he grows up, he will probably continue to be a "Yes-Man."</p>
<h3>The Telephone Shortage in America</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>America is not only experiencing a housing shortage like Shanghai, but also a telephone shortage. Although Bell Telephone Company has installed 6.5 million new telephones in the two years since the victory, more than 1.5 million orders are still backlogged and unfulfilled.</p>
<p>The main shortage is in wiring and switchboards. The process of connecting a local call is extremely complex, involving countless pieces of telephone equipment.</p>
<p>In 1945, one out of every two households in the United States had a telephone; now, almost two out of every three households have one. In 1940, roughly one out of every four rural households had a telephone, but now it has developed to the point where nearly two out of every four households have one. In terms of population distribution, San Francisco has the most telephones, with 44 telephones per 100 people. Washington, D.C. is second, with 41 telephones per 100 people; New York is third, with an average of 29 telephones per 100 people.</p>
<p>The more difficult it is to install a telephone, the more people seem to want to install one. People are offering tips of up to $500 to install a telephone. Because veterans have priority in getting telephones installed, some companies are using them as a front. Also, because business telephones have priority over private telephones, some people living in apartments are renting office suites to make money, disguising their homes as commercial offices. Furthermore, some healthy people are asking doctors for help in proving that they are sick in order to get priority in installing a telephone; with so many "patients" applying for telephone installation, some telephone company employees have had to keep medical dictionaries by their side. They sometimes discover that the alarming-sounding medical terms used in doctors' reports actually only mean that the patient has a severe cold or sore throat.</p>
<p>Americans are also making more telephone calls. The number of long-distance calls they now make in a day is more than the number of calls made in a week in 1940, and the number of overseas calls is ten times the total number in 1940.</p>
<p>Even children are making more telephone calls than before the war. As soon as school is dismissed, the number of telephone calls suddenly increases. The telephone company has published notices asking children to conserve telephone usage. Recently, the general manager of Bell Telephone Company received a letter from a teenage boy saying that his social life was being "hampered" by the lack of a telephone, with this sentence: "The girls can't call me, and they're complaining too!" The general manager sent him a tactful reply, adding at the end: "P.S. When I was sixteen, I didn't have a telephone either."</p>
<h3>Casual Reminiscences of a Trip to Wu</h3>
<p>— Cao Jingtao</p>
<p>A few days ago, I happened to travel to Wumen and drank tea at Maoyuan, recalling that during the Yichou year (1925), I gathered here daily with Mr. Kuang Huifeng. Counting the years, it has been more than twenty years. Mr. Huifeng's tomb is already covered with grass, and I am also growing old. Pondering the present and recalling the past, I am filled with emotions.</p>
<p>When I was young, I studied poetry. One night, I wrote a poem, saying: "Unable to sleep on a spring night, I sit alone by a quiet lamp. Dewdrops moisten the steps, the well windlass creaks. Wind comes from the waves, the moon casts shadows on the flowers. A neighboring flute suddenly sounds, entrusting thoughts to the desolate scenery." Mr. Huifeng praised this poem highly after Chen Sanuan showed it to him. In the summer of Yichou, Mr. Huifeng moved to Wumen and visited me in Zhuanzhu Lane, which was the beginning of my acquaintance with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Huifeng was sixty-eight years old that year, dressed in Taoist attire, appearing ethereal and otherworldly. When he passed through the streets, thousands of people stared at him.</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Wu Quan, from Beijing, came and hosted a banquet for Mr. Dong and his son at a restaurant in the city, inviting me and Mr. Yu Sulu to accompany them. At that time, Mr. Sulu was nearly eighty years old, looking very old. Mr. Huifeng insisted that he try singing, and he actually sang with a full voice and precise steps, reverberating like clouds being stopped, unattainable by others.</p>
<p>Mr. Quan summoned a courtesan to serve wine. One courtesan was not beautiful, but Mr. Huifeng particularly appreciated her, and the young masters whispered to each other privately. Mr. Huifeng then asked, "What do you two think of this woman?" The young masters were embarrassed and dared not answer yes or no. Mr. Huifeng smiled and said, "This woman seems vulgar but is actually elegant, what is called clear amidst turbidity! It's just that you are too young to know her beauty!" The two guests applauded.</p>
<p>Mr. Huifeng was skilled in examining remaining ink, with exceptional talent and ability, on par with Mr. Zhu Guwei. Mr. Huifeng himself said that he rarely wrote poetry, and when he did, it was not very skillful. He had several quatrains from his early years, which he occasionally recited to me, but I have now forgotten them, only remembering the two lines, "Thirty-six bridges are unparalleled in the world, the people of Jiangnan are most of all from Suzhou." In my humble opinion, their style is actually closer to lyrics in recent times.</p>
<p>Mr. Huifeng lived in Wu for a very short time, to avoid internal turmoil, before returning to Shanghai. A month later, he suddenly passed through Suzhou and married a certain woman, his heroic spirit no less than that of Xiong Bing San and Li Shizeng.</p>
<h3>Verses Near the Clouds</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Composed When Yao Nanyuan Sent a Rhyme that Was Difficult to Respond To</p>
<p>Gazing intently at the distant misty flowers, the warm wind irons the traces of the brush dry. Adding branches and leaves truly requires momentum, the mountain slopes and valleys must be settled. Who enters the room forgetting offensive smells? Danqing is useless, I dip my brush. Recently, I have slightly avoided the intention of facing the door; in each piece of cloudy peaks, there are rocky mountains. (Inscription on an Ink Orchid Scroll)</p>
<p>The autumn heat is like baking, thirst is finally quenched, the feelings of past years are like exchanging books on gourds. A three-day feast fills the belly, a taste of coolness settles the residence; waiting to laugh at the children who are busy remembering, but pitying the old man's hesitation, composing poems to thank is truly shameless, thinking that there must be a surplus at the east gate.</p>
<h3>The Books Stored in Wen Su Ge Are Safe</h3>
<p>— Zhai Meilin</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Zhou Tingwu's article "The Books Stored in Wen Su Ge" in your publication, and I deeply share his feelings of love and concern for the cultural relics of our homeland. I have recently come to Beijing from my hometown of Shenyang to seek employment and know that the Siku Quanshu in Wen Su Ge is still completely intact, preserved at its original location on the west side of the Qing Palace in Pan Yang. The buildings are tall and the book shelves are complete and undamaged. Since the September 18th Incident, it has been under the control of the enemy, the puppets, and the Communists, all of whom have taken good care of it. The Japanese did not loot or transport it. After the August 15th recovery, the central government even sent Mr. Jin Yufu to be responsible for sorting out the cultural relics of the Northeast, with daily additions. The pavilion is now open to the public, and each volume is not only beautifully written but also elegantly and simply bound with fine paper, making it an invaluable treasure.</p>
<p>In addition, for more than two hundred years under the Qing dynasty, the deceased emperors and empresses of each dynasty were granted royal documents. All the jade documents, made of dark green jade, varied in size depending on the rank of the empress, numbering in the hundreds of cases. They are also displayed in the same place as the Siku Quanshu.</p>
<p>Wen Su Ge has a guest book for visitors to sign their names. Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Dai Tianchou, Chu Weijun, and Zhao Daiwen have all signed their names. This book will be passed down to future generations along with the complete collection of books and jade documents. The dates of the inscriptions are roughly in the teens of the Republic era, more than twenty years ago. What is valuable is not only that those who signed their names were able to view the complete collection of books, but also that during their time in Pan, they each shouldered great missions, the impact of which on China should be even more important than the complete collection of books. The history of today since the seventeenth year of the Republic of China may have originated at that time, another karmic connection with the complete collection of books.</p>
<p>Now that my hometown is engulfed in flames and the people are suffering, it is fortunate that the national treasures are still safe. I am writing this brief account to inform those who are concerned. But without the skin, where can the hair attach itself? If the country's territory is not valued, then what is the value of this Siku Quanshu?</p>
<h3>Gold</h3>
<p>— Qian Wen</p>
<p>When Wang Mang fled, the palace had 600,000 catties of gold. He did not treat this national precious metal as his private property, refusing to sink it into the sea or bury it in the valleys, but leaving it for those who came later. This was the enlightened behavior of a political failure. The Han Dynasty had national gold stored in the palace, but it was not hoarded. Ancient and modern power systems are different. Others have calculated that 600,000 catties is equivalent to 288,000 catties in the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Dong Zhuo collected many treasures looted from the Wubao, but very little gold. It is said that it was only 20,000 to 30,000 catties, and silver was only 80,000 to 90,000 catties. Was it that gold was scattered among the people and difficult to collect, or that he did not value precious metals? One of the two must be true. He Shen of the Qing Dynasty had a total private property worth 800 million taels of silver, but only 26,800 taels of gold ingots and gold leaves were found in the hidden walls of his home, which cannot be considered much. Did he also not value gold?</p>
<p>The amount of gold hidden among the people is difficult to estimate. Ren Fang's "Record of Strange Events" says that when Yuan Shao was in Jizhou, the market was full of gold but there was no millet for sale; when Liu Bei was in Jingzhou, millet and gold were of equal value; during the Yongjia Rebellion, Luoyang was barren, and Emperor Huai sent people to observe the market. Pearls, jade, gold, and silver were openly displayed in the market, but there was no millet or wheat. At the end of the Han Dynasty, there was a great famine, and a Jianghuai folk song said that exchanging gold for millet was more valuable than gold; a Luoyang nursery rhyme said that even with a thousand taels of gold, it was not as good as a dou of millet. During war and famine, it was impossible to get millet. There was so much gold among the people that it was no wonder that Ren regarded it as strange and recorded it. Gu Yanwu said that before the Tang and Song dynasties, the goods commonly used by the upper and lower classes were all money. He also quoted the "Comprehensive Examination of Documents," saying that during the Liang dynasty, the regions of Jiaoguang traded entirely in gold and silver. This is evidence that the amount of gold held by the people was gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Ancient gold was not as valuable as it is today. Gu Yanwu said that in the eighth year of Hongwu, one tael of gold was worth four taels of silver, which is what is called four-to-one exchange. In the eighteenth year of Hongwu, it was a five-to-one exchange, in the eleventh year of Yongle, it was seven-and-a-half-to-one, in the Wanli period, it was seven- or eight-to-one, in the Chongzhen period, it was ten-to-one, and in the Zhida period of the Yuan dynasty, it was also ten-to-one. This shows that the price of gold gradually increased and was constantly changing. The Zhida and Chongzhen periods were three hundred and twenty or thirty years apart, but the exchange rate was the same, ten-to-one. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, it was as high as thirty-six-to-one; in the early years of the Republic of China, it was only about that. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, when the war was raging, it was about one hundred-to-one, but I don't remember clearly. Song Yingxing's "Exploitation of the Works of Nature" was woodblock printed in the Chongzhen Dingchou year. The book states that the value of the finest gold is sixteen thousand times that of black iron. Adding Gu Yanwu's ten-to-one exchange rate, 160 taels of silver could buy one catty of gold, or 16,000 catties of black iron, which is a little less than ten tons.</p>
<p>Song also said that the weight of gold is extremely high. If a copper square inch weighs one tael, then silver should be increased by three qian per inch; if a silver square inch weighs one tael, then gold should be increased by two qian per inch. This is the metal specific gravity known to the Chinese people three hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The ancients believed that the greatest consumption of gold was in the creation of Buddhist statues, which is a fact. For example, the "History of the Wei Dynasty" states that in the first year of Xingguang, five statues of Sakyamuni, each sixteen feet tall, were planned, all using 25,000 catties of pure gold; in the Tian'an period, a statue of Sakyamuni, forty-three feet tall, was made, using 100,000 catties of pure gold and 600 catties of gold. In fact, the consumption of gold was not limited to this. The utensils of the rich and the screens and windows in the house were often gilded, and the total amount must have been greater than that used by the Buddhist statues in various temples, but because they were scattered, they were not as noticeable as the Buddhist statues. "Exploitation of the Works of Nature" says that seven li of gold is used to make each square inch of gold leaf, which is really too thick, and there is no such luxury now. According to this book, using a thousand pieces to cover a surface, it can cover three feet in length and width, because three feet square is nine hundred square inches, requiring nine hundred pieces of gold leaf weighing seven li each, using more than six taels and three qian of gold. I believe that the gold leaf used by emperors to make Buddhist statues must have been thicker, while that used by the common people was slightly thinner. Scientists say that one li of gold can actually be rolled into gold leaf seventy-five inches square, with a thickness of 1/367,000 of an inch, and one li is 1/5760 of a troy pound.</p>
<p>After the war, my wedding gold ring has also disappeared, and the two gold false teeth that I still have in my mouth, I don't know how much pure gold they contain.</p>
