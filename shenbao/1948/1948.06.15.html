<h3 id="c26">幣制改革成敗的關鍵 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 粟寄滄</p>
<p>戲院改　，魚文　氏覺命組閣，一般人都預想政府在經濟財政方面將有新措施，尤其是幣制改革，可能即由研究設計的階段進入準儲實論的階段。前中央銀行總裁貝祖詒氏兩度奉派赴美，據聞即携有細於幣制改革的全盤計劉，就商美國當局並懇求予以援助。從各種跡象觀察，改革幣制可能為翁內閣任內最重要的經濟新猷，而其成敗又可能是決定今後中國經濟暫得穩定或更趨惡化的一大議健。我們認爲幣觔　　係國計民生至深且鉅，政府事前必須有周密的計劃，　　尤須有排除萬難貫激到底的決心和毅力。當局萬不可視幣制改革為財政上一時應急之策，用以賺取眼前的小利，而不在經濟上作長治久安的打算。我們觀閱各國改革幣制的歷史，就可以知這幣制改革的眞正困難，不在設計一個完美的貨幣制度，而在如何維持和穩定這個制度。一國貨幣制度之建立，主要應以「自力更生」為原則，不能純靠外力的援助。惟在當前醞釀幣制改革的過程中，我們却發現了幾種錯誤的觀點和危險的傾向：</p>
<p>第一，有些人以爲所謂幣制改革，目的只在於以一種新幣去掉換現有的法幣，在現貨幣名稱和版式的劃一以及單位的降低，以謀交易授受和記帳上的便利。作此看法的人只注意幣制改革的形式，而忽視幣制改革的實質——忽視幣制對於社會經濟所能產生的影響。這種看法是不正確的。今日中國之幣制改革，目的不僅是要建立一個究善的貨幣制度，而更重要的是要藉幣制改革去挽救整個財政經濟的危機，換言之，我們必須把幣制改革當作一個財政上和纏濟上的政策，藉以平衡財政的收支，恢復經濟的常態，並糾正社會財富分配不　的現象。爲達到這些目的，我們不但要注意幣制改革的技術，尤須利用新幣掉換舊幣的機會，對大部分淤資加以凍結·課稅·沒收，或轉移其用途，　規定各種不同的兌換率，適用於各　階層的人民，這樣，我們就可以在財政經濟上收到如下的效果。（一）减少貨幣流通的數量及其速度；（二）增加國庫收入；（三）充裕生產建設資金；（四）糾正因通貨膨脹而發生的財富分配不均。老實說，處今日中國而談幣制改革，如果不把它當作挽救財政經濟危機的手段來運用，是沒有多犬意義的，而且也是決不會成功的。</p>
<p>第二·目前中國通貨膨脹已達到極危險的階段，社會經濟已瀕於總崩潰的前夕，如幣制改革而不能成功，則後果之嚴重眞是難以想像。因之，幣制改革是只許成功不許失敗的。我們不談幣制改革便罷，否則必須以最大決心最大魄力去穩定新幣的價値，這是全部改革工作成敗閱鍵之所在。要想穩定新幣的幣値，政府於着手改革幣制之際，必須同時採取下列各項平行的措施：（一）集　收兌國人所有金銀外幣，並以長期低利公債徵借國人在外存款，用以充實新幣的準備金；（二）獎勵出口，限制入口，爭取僑匯，减少一切不必要的外匯支出，以謀國際收支之平衡；（三）擴大並提高接稅（所利得稅·遺產稅·地價稅·土地增值稅等）的徵課，尤其是喧嚷已久的財產稅必須認眞實行，同時，在節流方面，應大量裁减兵額，撤併不必要的行政超關和無效率的國營事業機　，以謀變現財政枚支之平衡，（四）厲行預決算制度；財政公開，謹慎發行，定期公佈發行數字，並公開檢查發行準備，以堅定人民對新幣的信心，（五）健全中央銀行，使能切實負起管理通貨，統制外匯及調節金融的責任。以上各項辦法實行起來不免多有掣肘，但當此經濟總崩潰危機已　在睫之時，政府如果還有自救救民的覺悟，那就應該拿出，「壯士斷腕」和「大義滅親」的精神來！</p>
<p>第三，外援對於一國幣制的改革自然是有益處的，從而　取外援也是應該的。但外援只可利用，而不可依賴，因爲一則外援不是取之不盡用之不竭的，二則外援之得來也不是無代個無條件的。如果我們沒有自力更生的辦法，不用說三億五億的美元不够消耗，就是十億八億的美元也支持不了多久的。我們當勝利之初，不是也擁有八九億元的美匯和五六百萬兩的黃金囑？然而曾幾何時，竟弄得國庫一貧如洗，靠着發鈔和借債度日。當局近來似乎把改革幣制的希望完全寄託在美貸上面，而很少在國內經濟財政上作積極革新的準備，我們覺得這不像在改革幣制，而只是想藉此撈得一筆外債，以渡過眼前財政的難關。假如我們的觀察不錯，那麼幣制改革的前途就難以令人樂觀了。</p>

<h3 id="c43">宋國賓醫師談楊妹 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>〔本報江都十二日訊〕前震旦大學生理學敎授，上海市醫師公會主席宋國賓，對楊妹九年不食問題極感興味，認爲此類新聞，史有先例，事屬可能，並不違反科學，其見解殊可寳貴，茲特刋佈如次：</p>
<p>楊妹不食，已歷九年，累誌報端，宣騰中外。有認為怪誕不經，違反科學，無置信之可能者，亦有認為空前奇蹟，千載一時，有研究之價値者。渝市衛生當局，曾加檢驗，證明：（一）三週以來，確然不食，惟日飲淸水少許。（二）體重體溫無顯著繼續低降之勢。（三）三週以來，未嘗大便，僅小便若干次。（四）身體瘦削，然無衰竭現象。（五）生活淸閒，無繫劇工作。鄙人於此，略抒所見如次：</p>
<p>按不食有二：一為完全不食，一為不完全不食。完全不食，即絕對任何飲食不進；如此則體溫日降，體重日减，當體重减去百分之四十，體溫降至二十三四度時，則死亡立現，無可倖免。不完全不食，由漸次遞减，最後每日除飲水及少量果品外，一概不食，體重體溫，雖亦逐日低降，然至相當程度，則憂然中止。蓋淸水及水果之攝取，亦能维持其最低之新陳代謝，此種不完全不食，又名　穀，或曰絕粒，楊妹不食，殆屬此種。古之求仙者流，靜坐深山之中，日吃水果數枚，而能維持其生命者，非無故也。蓋寂然不動，無思無慮，則體內消耗與需要，必减至最低限度，果品與水，亦含有相當養料，身體有適應機能，久而久之，此最低之營養價，遂亦能補充其最低之生命需要，故神　雖不可成，而　穀尙不難致。莫友芝〔淸道光舉人〕在其「邵亭遺文」中，有古風一首，記一孀婦，年三十餘，夫死，矢志絕粒，日惟飲水少許，如是者五十年，壽至八十餘始卒。史有先例，並非妄誕不經，事屬可能，並不違反科學。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平十四日電〕本市治安當局，於五月下旬遜續破獲共匪晋冀魯豫中央局及晋察冀邊區公安管理處在平之地下組織兩起，其分佈在平津方面潛匪，均經予以逮捕，計共捕獲男女人狂五十七名，為本年度破獲最重要之案件。據平警備總部今續發表全案破獲情形於次：</p>
<p>線索來源：本年一月間治安當局先後接獲匪方內綫報告，共匪晉冀魯豫中央局派遣高級負責人楊某前來北平，佈置地下工作。並企圖打入特種刑事法庭，以掩護匪諜活動，並圖控制特種刑庭對於奸匪案件之審理，治安當局據報後，經查明楊某係隸屬於共匪首領康安系統，有批准黨員入黨調整組織之權，案情至為重大，當經佈置偵察網，嚴密偵察，以期一網打盡，同時又獲悉晋察冀派出之女匪陳英華（又名敏英）亦來平活動，遂又派遺工作人員持匪方證件打入陳之內部，使其深信不疑，先後取得重要文件，新式無綫電圖樣，攝成照片，以備質證，我方工作人員並受命代匪搜購電料儲存，以備架設電台之用，亦佯為應允，靜待時機成熟。</p>
<p>破獲經過：迨至上月下旬，偵察大致成熟，乃着手破案，經週密佈置後，於廿七日零時分頭行動，首在北新華街甲六號報光電器修理行將匪高級負責人楊某捕獲，當搜出其部下工作人員名單一份，黨團組織人事，經濟調查綱要一份，及其他重要文件原則，反動宣傳刋物等多種。比經鞫訊，當供出所有組織關係，同時女匪陳英華及其屬員金克彥，閻光宇，郭大同，梁秀文，馬錫天，姚寬民，李寳貴，高雄飛等八名，亦已一併捕獲，並在各該犯家中分別搜出情報資料，文稿，電機，圖樣，電料，密電本，河北省公路局礦區地圖，公路局搶修路綫圖等件，經一併帶案，詳加研訊，得悉上述匪犯活動詳情如次：</p>
<p>活動情形：女匪陳英華係受匪晋察冀邊區公安管理處之指揮，金克彥偸竊我軍密電本及公路局礦區地圖，搶修路綫圖，閻光宇供給宣化方面軍事情報，郭大同經常來往匪區與晋察冀邊區政治部胡昂，馬霞等速絡，梁秀文，馬錫天共同設計繪製無綫電圖樣等，練習收發報準備担任電務工作，姚寬民聯絡匪區來往人員及儲存電料，李實貴·高雄飛皆由陳之指引計劃，分別担任工作，俱已供認不諱。天津方面獲案者，計黃維仁領導之打字機廠長王幼錚，長蘆育嬰堂王眞儒，新時報李冶心，市府財玫局主任科員李鐵鈞及方博如等六人。以上各犯皆係證據確　，或為匪黨員，或與匪聯絡，亦經供認不諱，並有馬俊武一名，現任地方法院檢察官，匪黨員參加特種刑事法庭，均中其介紹，並來平與楊某聯絡，亦被逮捕。總計先後共捕男女匪犯五十七名，本案偵查截至目前止，已吿一段落，全案即將移送法庭訊辦。</p>

<h3 id="c46">日本內閣風雨飄搖　龐大預算案遭激烈反對　蘆田希望美援早日撥到 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十四日電〕大部份官方人士相信，蘆田之聯合內閣，因面對重重新困難，巳開始動搖，可能在協助日本經濟復興之美援到達之前，即將倒閣。蘆田個人則希望此總額達數十億之基金，能在七月一日前撥付給日本。</p>
<p>按蘆田內閣前早以空前龐大之一九四八至四九年度預算案，遭遇堅强之反對。此項預算，總額達四千億日元，因此，將促成普遍之漲價，其中如火車客票增加三倍半，郵資及電話費增加四倍半。因西尾副首相之遭受政治攻擊，益使蘆田內閣陷於困境，一部份國會反對黨議員巳請求東京區檢察署對西尾採取行動，責以破壞選舉法之罪，因其在去年選釁前，接受五十萬日元之贈款，而未向當局註册。然在現行法律步　下，如檢察官擬對西尾起訴，必須先獲得首相之核准。</p>
<p>蘆田內閣最近復面臨一勞工問題，蓋擁有一百萬會員之公用事業勞工工會，向政府要求提高底薪至每月三千二百日元〔合美金四十元〕，較目前增加二千元，一般觀察家認爲政府不能接受。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十四日電〕據今晨東京各報消息稱：蘆田首相已決定在最近將來提出辭職其辭職之表面藉口，雖爲西尾事件，然主要理由却係由吉田領導下之民主自由黨，對現正在國會進行討論之預算，激烈反對所致。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十四日電〕日不管部閣員一松定吉，今在大阪發表談話，認爲因西尾問題，當然將引起內閣改組問題，倘此項改組問題不能順利進行，恐即只有解散國會重行選舉，總之，無論任何一項辦法，均必須在最近二三日內決定。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京十四日電〕日本巢鴨監獄中刻已在興築四座絞首台。盟軍官員並已採取各種可能預防辦法，以防止東條及其他日本主要戰犯在聽到遠東國際軍事法庭之判決前，逃逸或自殺。一般預料，此項歷史性之判決，將於八月初發表。據悉：此次判決書及判決之公佈程序，將效法紐倫堡法庭判決德國戰犯者。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕據十四日宣佈：日本和約問題，延擱旣久，世人幾已不復置念，該事於年底前或明年，恐仍無解決之希望。可靠人士稱：除非東西兩方面之歧見有重大之打破，始能早日思及對日和約。雖然，「冷戰」外之其他因素，仍可阻撓正式之遠東和會。此間官方對日本和約發動事，感到冷淡，該問題已遭無定期擱置。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎十三日電〕許曼政府使國會批準倫敦六國會議決議之奮鬥，經於週末加緊作會外之活動後，成功之希望已漸趨濃厚。預料皮杜爾於週二或週三向國會答覆辯論之際，當能以較上週五更肯定的態度，以克服議會中人對六國協議的懷疑。</p>
<p>皮杜爾主張倫敦會議決議，必須原封不動予以接受，而比較更多政治經騐的許曼總理則主張於解釋或適用倫敦會議建議之際，法國尚須保留與西方强國繼續磋商的機會。許曼並確認事實上確有覓取若干方法，使法國人民感覺法國並無被侵略危險的需要。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十三日電〕戴高樂今日在法國中部奈佛爾發表演說，指倫敦六國會議協定已暴露許曼政府之弱點。他說此一協定，不啻爲對於法國之又一警吿，證明法國現政權之官員正圖使法國接受不必要的讓步。此等讓步將使法國不能取得其所應得者，同時亦使法國不能從事對歐洲和平的供獻。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京十三日電〕五個美國首要商人業已奠定一美國對日本經濟復興之計劃，此一計劃不論對日和約簽訂與否，亦能予以進行。此計劃名爲「對日本與朝鮮之經濟地位及前途之報吿及改進日韓之必須措置」，共有五十一頁，此乃瓊司敦（化學與信託銀行董事長），霍夫曼（司蒂倍克汽車公司董事長），羅利（紐約銀行家），斯哥洽（紐約著名紡織工業家），於本年四月杪訪問日本及朝鮮兩週之結果。此訪日韓使團係美陸軍部次長特萊柏所率領者，但渠對此報吿並未簽署，此後霍夫曼即被任為美國援外計劃執行人。</p>
<p>三個前提</p>
<p>瓊司敦報吿較先其六次之日本工業調查報告更爲廣泛，該報吿包括上自减少日本賠償問題，下至希望外國向日本投資之整個日本復興範園。此一建議乃基於下列三個前提下：</p>
<p>（一）工業化之日本，乃爲對美國之經濟及戰略資產。</p>
<p>（二）日本自給自足，可使美國人每年减少四億元之負担。</p>
<p>（三）日本成爲出口國家，可協助整個遠東之復興。</p>
<p>六項建議</p>
<p>爲上述之目的，該報吿建議：</p>
<p>（一）依日本目前出口水準，增加至八或九倍，俾日本能償付進口之食糧及原料，此乃保持日本「合理北生活水準」所必須者。</p>
<p>（二）應鼓勵日本建築船隻，購買或租借船只，以增加其海運，目前限制日本建築六千噸以上船隻之禁令，應予取消。</p>
<p>（三）日本與亞洲前敵國允其中國間貿易，爲雙方利益計，應予恢復。</p>
<p>（四）日本應自其附近國家獲得糧食或其他原料，如戰前然。職是之故，有關日本對外國貿易之官樣文章，應予减少，俾准允日本商人可與外國商行直接接觸。</p>
<p>（五）最後賠償之解決，爲以價値二八〇·五六一·七五〇元之戰爭工廠及設備，給予勝利之國家。此項賠償，以一九三九牟日元四元合一元美元之滙兌率折合。</p>
<p>根據該報吿稱：若此建議予以實施，供賠償之工廠設備及機器工具之總額，將低於海外諮詢公司所提出之水準。換言之，此建議將爲日本賠償建議中最低者。</p>
<p>（六）由於日本貨幣之不穩定，設立日元之滙兌率乃不可能者，而五十日元對一美元之「軍用滙兌率」，應修正之，及應用於新外國投資上。</p>
<p>愼重報告</p>
<p>該報吿又愼重勸吿稱：對日本之任何外國投資，應受盟軍總部及日本政府之「相當監督」，以保護投資人不受課稅法之歧視，及商行之囊括。</p>
<p>關於協助日本出口，該報吿强調稱：對日本之借款越多越好，俾日本能購買原料，及向國外出賣製造品。</p>
<p>日本簽訂和約之後，日本應通過法律，以引誘外國之投資</p>
<p>該報吿又指出：日本在歷史上之角色，爲一出口國家。同時主張日本以美棉製成棉織品，在美國市塲出售，但此一步驟已爲美國棉紡製造商所激烈反對。</p>
<p>該報吿並未列舉美國應採取之措置，惟嚴令日本政府平衡其預算表。蓋日本一九三〇至一九三一年來，在預算表上即出現赤字迄今，日本預算表不能平衡，主要原因爲通貨膨脹不斷所致，而支配今日之經濟情形。</p>
<p>朝鮮問題</p>
<p>該報吿末稱：朝鮮經濟之前途，端賴有經驗工業領袖及技術人才之發展，蓋日本帝國主義支配朝鮮已閱四十年，故朝鮮缺乏此項人才。解決此一問題之辦法，爲聘請美國高等顧問，然此不易辨到，故朝鮮政府應設法自日本獲得技術及指導人才。</p>

<p>關部長首先闡明糧食問題之關鍵在乎「量」與「價」：（一）米量方面——政府是否有足够食米供上海市民食用？現事實證明政府存米充足，七月份之配米量應爲五十萬担，規市庫所有者已超過此數，是則市民之恐慌心理應該可以消除。（二）米價方面——近日米價所波動，全由於人心恐慌所引起，因市民對於政府七月份後是否繼續配米一點發生懷疑。現政府業經決定繼續，則米價必可平穩。關部長認爲目前米價之上漲是偶爾的現象，渠保證政府有絕對把握可以控制米價。</p>
<h3 id="c64">發表書面談話 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>關部長昨因另有要公，故談話僅十餘分鐘，即匆匆離去，記者欲求發問之機會亦不可得。渠曾有事先印就之書面談話發表，內容如下：「最近滬市糧價波動，本人奉行政院翁院長命，來滬經與吳市長及各方詳細洽談，目前新麥業已登塲，秋禾栽插更屬普遍良好，且美援採購國外米麥陸續來華，雖有其他物價連帶因素，似不應有此現象。上海市民食米配售四閱月來，成績良好，政府決定繼續辦理，幷將集會檢討，益求改進，務求達到合理分配之目的。又七月份滬市配售糧源已籌足五十餘萬市石，準備充分，決無問題，再上海糧食供給就上項配售糧及公敎專案糧之供應，已達上海全市需要量七成左右，此外尚有麵粉雜糧爲數亦復不少，滬市民食絕無可慮，如有故意操縱哄抬情事，已經與吳市長商定平抑對策，隨時配合辦理。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕近日各加油站擁擠情形空前嚴重，尤其在近外灘一帶，由於加油之車輛爭先恐後，每日辦公時間以內之交通乃益見困難。市公用局與市警察局爲改善此種情形，昨日聯合通吿此一區域內之各加油站，規定即日起售油時問須自下午三時開始，以避免在上午及下午辦公時間內增加交通困難。惟昨日有不少車輛因事先未悉此新法規，仍於淸晨起即赴加油站，結果均須等候至下午三時，因此中正東路四川路河南路一帶停置之車輛排成一字長蛇陣，擁擠情况猶甚於往日。今日起新辦法爲衆週知後，希望能收改善之效。至實行此新辦法之加油站，爲西藏中路一五七號德士古油站，河南路福州路口德士古油站，四川路中正東路口亞細亞油站，南京東路八十五號亞細亞油站，四川路十一號美孚油站，四川路中正東路口美孚油站，蘇州路一一九號美孚油站等。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長昨日獲知交大學生自治會對於市府所發之第二封質詢函件，不擬答覆，並表示願意接受傳詢，但提出兩項條件之消息後，深爲不滿。渠於昨午之記者招待會中曾有所指斥。吳氏稱：我提出的八點質詢，乃最簡單之事實問題，如交大不予答覆，即等於是公開默認此次之反對美國扶植日本遊行，背後有人操縱，少數人刧持大衆，用愛國名義而從事擾亂治安之有計劃的陰謀。若學生確爲出乎純潔之愛國熟誠，則必可侃侃而答。渠保證絕對公開，將答函在各報披露。吳氏並宣佈，本星期六爲最後限期。</p>

<p>對於交大學生自治會所表示的「願意接受傳詢」，市長認爲甚屬可笑，因爲傳詢原係警局之權，根本無所謂「接受」與「不接受」。即或學生不願意，也須强迫「接受」。至於自治會所提之二項條件，其一爲要求公開傳詢，此點吳市長早經聲明再三，傳詢時絕對公開。唯學生所提之第二點「允許參加反美扶日遊行的各校學生作證」，吳氏認爲又是在趁此另作文章。渠稱：上次上法事件開庭時，數百學生　集法院旁聽，結果大呼口號，並高唱「你，你這個壞東西」歌曲。爲恐此種現象之重演，對學生所提第二點，礙難准許。但吳氏表示另有公開之辦法，將來於傳詢前夕，再行公佈。</p>

<p>吳市長最後報告，市府已有名單交與交大，囑其於各科系代表大會舉行時，贊成遊行者之名字旁加圈，俾供查究。但吳氏對於交大是否能够做到，表示懷疑。渠稱：「他們圈不圈毫無關係，主動者之詳細名單，我老早有了。我這是和他們展開神經戰，看共匪職業學生逃往那裏去？」</p>

<p>京滬路局警務處，頃破獲共匪駐京滬地下工運機關案，匪首業已就逮。據該犯在警務處供出，轟動全市之申新九廠工潮案，同濟大學學潮案及舞潮案，均係若輩所煽動。</p>
<p>緣警務處最近接報，得悉共匪京滬綫工運組，擬在無錫策動申新工廠工潮，匪首並擬由滬赴錫指揮。王兆槐處長得悉後，當即下令所屬錫滬段長劉耀嚴加防範。本月七日晨錫滬段幹員，果在無錫站捕獲匪首朱松茂一名，數度嚴詢，始直認係京滬綫工運負責者之一。該匪並供出共匪在京滬綫之工運組織共八百餘人，上海計百餘人，組長係李承光。上海著名之申新血案，同濟學潮案及舞女搗毁社會局案，均係該單位主幹策動。本年四月若輩奉命策動無錫申新三廠工潮，事洩未果。此次奉令由渠負責部署，乃於月初由滬赴錫，在申新三廠傍側小客棧居住數晚，並已與潛伏廠內之共匪秘密完成佈置工潮綫索，將擬於月中發動。該匪並供出共匪工運人員藉商店烟號工廠及機關等種種身份爲掩護，從事學潮工潮及舞女運動。渠妻徐氏係京滬綫某邑民意代表之參議員，並供出某縣府課長及工廠技師均係共匪幹部。警務處王處長對該縣殊爲重視，特囑押解來滬，昨日在路警嚴密押解下，已解抵上海，當由王處長偕同劉段長親加鞫審。該匪昨日供述時，供出共匪種種陰謀至詳，並自述投匪經過及撰述自白書。該匪定日內移送特種刑庭詢辦云。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕據說從前曾有一個作過很多次防火視察的官員，在視察中常聽到居戶的嘮叨：「這烟囱有什麼危險？挺合適的，裝在這裏已有四五十年了，從來沒有引起過火災」！他立刻用深沉的經驗回答說：「先生，四五十年不發生火災，未必即可保證永遠的不發生危險」！後來其中十分之八在忘記了這種　吿的同時，居宅都遭遇了極可怖的火災。</p>
<p>四五十年來未肇焚如，並非消除瞬間降臨慘禍的保證，這道理，上海市民都瞭解，但是都不能記住，違反建築規則，儲藏易燃物品，還有很多在經過一天辛勞的工作後，入睡前去下了一段香烟頭。火災終於在他們不經意間突然爆發了</p>
<p>太平洋龍頭時生障礙</p>
<p>火災旣起，事主面對着熊熊烈熖，當然要搶護畢生經營的燬滅，報警吧！消防總隊控制室的電話是在商業最繁忙的中區，表軌聲久候不至；等到救火車拉直着警報開出了，路狹車多，到塲時間不會理想；等到水帶接通，太平龍頭往往又生障碍；去年長陽路東南套鞋廠大火，消防車急急　救，但是近處第一只龍頭軸心損壞了，換一只，裏面全裝滿了石塊，再換一只發覺仍舊塡塞着石塊，最後在遠隔三條馬路以外機找到有效的龍頭，水帶延長了一千三百呎，時間耗費數分鐘，延燒終於殃及隣近十幾戶。賢明的家長們！據事後調查這些石塊和軸心全是被孩子們弄壞的！消防檢查人員無法防範這些人爲的悲哀！</p>
<p>一種打擊一種侮辱</p>
<p>事主對撲滅火災的焦急往往有些反常，警車來遲，接水稍慢，以致怨聲四起，這於消防員是一種打擊；去年新建路中南製罐廠火起，消防車趕到時火熖已熄，屋頂尚冒白烟，但是廠裏却堅拒消防員登高撲滅餘燼，這對消防員的工作是一種侮辱。再如去年南市方浜路大火，消防車抵達後忽然水源斷絕，他們祗得設法到南陽橋外去接水，瘋狂的火焰怎能等待這一段等於外灘到新世界的遼遠路程，結果是造成近百戶的傾家蕩產，這是公用事業對消防工作開了玩笑。</p>
<p>在「帮帮忙，我明白的！」的誘惑之下，）敗類消防員兩年來被陸續淘汰了，在「進人火塲蜚語中傷，不進火塲被責意忽」的威脅之下，很多善良消防員又紛紛辭職。現在這塊擁有五百萬人口密度的土地上，消防員總數祗有四百五十八人，我們居住安全時刻感到恐懼不是沒有原因的！上月份八十四次火災一千五百餘億的損失更不是沒有原因的！</p>
<p>補充決非咄嗟可辦</p>
<p>歸根結底：經費不足，編制受了限制，消防組織自是無法擴充。上海是有幅員七十八萬市畝的大都市，但是太平龍頭祗有三二九一只，逾齡消防車輛五十三部，還是租界時代的遺產，消防單位更少了，不及廿九個警察分局的三分之一。依照專家估計，如果要平衡上海偌大面積和人口的火災危險，消防設備至少應該擴充到：消防單位四十三所，太平龍頭一三六五八只，救火車二八〇輛。那麽任何地區發生火災，五分鐘內可以到達和出水，但這一種「理想安全計劃」，何時纔能實現？</p>
<p>這裏還有「人」的問題。以目前消防員的總數來應變，廿四小時中不能有休息，這於工作效率當然大有影響。但是訓練一個消防員由開始至成熟，至少需五年以上的時間，補充決非咄嗟可辦，司機警長兪長根上週殉職，消防技工又弱一個，追悼會上當局的沉痛哀悼是够人深思的！</p>

<p>昨日米市見空前暴漲，因受錫市漲風波及，加之業外各物均續向高峯挺進，人心堅昂，經濟　員雖至市上監視交易，然人心嶧昂，並不稍减。早市喊價驚人，特高粳曾喊一千零五十萬，白粳亦曾衝出千萬大關，惟少交易。後市正式做開白粳及薄稻各爲九百九十萬元，但並非高貨。羊秈及白元均高達九百九十萬，各升約百萬元。南市塲各米亦加百萬元。</p>

<p>— 孤鷗</p>
<p>情欲</p>
<p>人生最眞切最可靠的，應該是他當下的心覺了。但心覺却又最跳脫，最不易把捉。純由內心覺感而言，人生儼如一大瀑流，剎那剎那變滅，刻不停住。當下現前，倐忽即逝，無法控揣。無法凝止。任何人要緊密用心在當下現前，使感此苦。你的心不在奔向未來，即在繫戀過去。若我們把前者說是希望，後者說是記憶。人生大流似乎被希望和記憶平分了。你若把記憶全部毀滅，此無異把你全部人生取銷，但亦絕對沒有對未來絕無希望的人生。惟此兩者間，多少總有些偏輕偏重。有的是記憶支配了希望，有的是希望支配了記憶，絕難在兩者間調停平勻，不偏不倚的。然而正因這偏輕偏重，造出人生之絕大差異。</p>
<p>我們姑如此說，人生有偏向前（多希望未來）和偏向後（重記憶過去）之兩型。向後型的特徵，最顯著的是愛好歷史。歷史全是人生過往之記錄，向前型的人，對此不耐煩，他們急要向前，急要向未來不可知域闖去，他們不要現實，要理想。重歷史的人，只從現實中建立理想，急向未來的，則要建立了理想來改造現實。小說劇本多從此種要求下產生。這多是描繪理想的未來人生的。但未來人生到底不可知，你若屢向此方闖進，你自會感到像有一種力量，或說命運，在外面擺佈你，作弄你，他是如何般有力，又是如何般冷酷而可悲。你若認爲過去全過去了，不屬你的分，當知未來又是如何地渺茫，錯縱，而多變化，凡是未來，全不由你作主，地也同樣不屬於你。你的未來遂步展開，將證明你的理想逐步不眞切，或是逐步變質而退讓。你若硬守住個人的希望不放鬆，硬要向前閒，那多半會　成悲劇。一切小說劇本裏的最高境界，也一定是悲劇的。</p>
<p>種桑長江邊，這是何等的不穩妥，因此向前型的人生，很容易從小說劇本轉入宗敎。宗敎和小說的人生，同樣在未來希望裏支撑，只是把未來希望更移後，索性移入別一世界，上帝和天國，根本不是一世界的事，把此作爲未來希望，這無異說，對此現世更不希望。因此宗敎也是一悲劇，只是把最後一募無限移緩，宗敎的人生，依然是戲劇的小說的人生，同是抱着未來希望撲進不可知之數而堅決不肯退讓一的種向前型的人性之熱烈表示。</p>
<p>歷史人生却不然。他之回憶過去，更重於懸想未來。過去是過去了，但你心上豈不留着他一片記憶嗎？這些痕迹，你要保留，誰又能來剝奪你呢？那是你對人生的眞實收獲，可以永藏心坎，永不褪滅。人生不斷向前，未必趕上了所希望，而且或離希望更遠了，希望逐步幻滅，記憶，却逐步增添，逐步豐富，人生更無所得，只有記憶，那是人人可以安分守己不勞而獲的。那是生活對人生惟一質實的禮物，你該什襲珍藏吧！</p>
<p>中國的國民性，大體上應屬向後型，因此歷史的發達，勝過了文學，文學中又以小說劇本爲娩不發達的項目。依照中國觀念，奔向未來的是欲，戀念過去的是情，不惜犧牲過去來滿足未來的是欲，寗願犧牲未來遷就過去的是情。中國觀念重情不重欲。男女欲勝情，夫婦情勝欲，中國文學裏的男女，很少向未來的熱戀，却多對過去之深情，中國觀念稱此爲厚，因此說溫柔敦厚詩敎也。又說慎終追遠，民德歸厚矣。又說一死一生乃見交情，只要你不忘過去。把死的同樣當活的看。這種感情亦極熱烈，極浪漫，然而不是文學的，却轉成倫理的道德的。</p>
<p>西方人的愛，重在未來的幸福，中國則重在過去的情義。西方人對死者交付給上帝，中國則永永保藏在自己心中。他們看不起爲個人的未來命運而奪鬥，他們主張安命，因此每不能打開局面創造新的，只對舊的極回護，極保守，只要一塗上他的記憶面，他總想盡力保存，不使他模糊消失，或變色了。這也是另一種堅强有力的人生，力量全用在自己的內心深處，他並不是對未來不希望，他所希望的，偏重在他所回念的，他緊握着過去，做他未來生活的基準。他對過去，付以最切摯的眞情，只要你一侵入他的記憶，他便把你當作他的生命，決不放鬆你。忠呀！孝呀！全是這個道理。初看好像死守在一點上，但他實可以無往而不自得。要他向前，似乎累重吃力，但他向前一步，却有向前一步之所得，決不落空。他是把未來扭回向過去，把自己扭轉向別人。如此把死生人我打成一片。對自己個人的未來幸福，却像沒有多大憧憬。</p>
<p>向後型的文化展演也會有宗敎，但也和向前型的不同。向前型的注重希望，注重祈求，向後型的注重回念，注重報答。中國宗敎也和中國文學般，在中國觀念裏是情勝於欲的。是報恩重於求福的，而前型的不滿現狀，向前追求，因此感到在外有一個上帝的存在，其實也可說是一命運或力量之存在，如此則返顯人生，自感其渺小而且可厭了。帝我對立，發展成性惡論。向後型的人，對已往現實表示滿足，感恩圖報，只求盡其在我，外面的上帝失却重要性人生自我地位提高，於是發展出性善論。前者的上帝是超越的，後者的上帝則轉成內在的。如是則宗敎又復倫理化與道德化。一各自的偏輕偏重，走上各自的路，埋寃也吧，羨慕也吧，這是人性之莊嚴？誰不該莊嚴你自己的人性呢？</p>

<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>過應兒童心理需要和促進兒童自發活動，早已成爲近代敎育方法上的主要趨勢。這種理論的基礎，實源於十七世紀以來的歐洲文化思想的解放，盧梭（J．J．Rousseau）的自然主義的教育論，影響後世頗大。他的「愛彌兒（Emile）一書，主張尊重兒童天性，發展兒童的自由思想，開了新敎育理論與方法的先河，那戕害人性的傳統敎育，也就因此發生動搖。</p>
<p>我國的敎育，數千年來墨守陳說，因襲舊法，不是强制的注入灌輸，便是消極的禁阻抑止。宋元明理學家輩出，以明心見性爲敎育目的，論方法則為敬以絕盧，主誠心，制私欲，偏重靜的修養，把生意和活力全都剝奪了。在那些希聖希賢道貌岸然的理學家心目中，根本就沒有「發展自由思想與意志」一同事。獨獨明代中葉出了一位先知先覺的敎育家王陽明，却在思想上開闢了嶄新的道路。他對心性的研究，精深博大超過周程朱陸，而於敎育上闡發的理論尤多發前人所未發。特別難能可貴的是陽明生當十五十六世紀之間，傳統的道學思想籠罩於整個社會，而他獨能自闢蹊徑，不囿陳說，提出敎育的新見解，新精神，比了十七世紀出生的盧梭，還要値得我們敬服。可惜世人只知他的「知行合一」「致良知」的哲學，很少了解他的兒童敎育的理論。</p>
<p>王陽明的兒童敎育理論，在他的「訓蒙大意示敎讀劉伯頌等」（見「傳習錄」）一文中闡述頗詳。他說：「今教童子，惟當以孝，弟，忠，信，禮，義，廉，恥爲專務。其栽培涵養之方，則宜誘之歌詩，以發其志意，導之習禮以肅其威儀，諷之讀書以開其知覺。今人往往以歌詩習禮爲不切時務，此習末俗庸鄙之見，　足以知古人立敎之意哉！」陽明認爲兒童教育的目的是「蒙以養正」（見同文），原則是「孝弟忠信禮義廉恥」，純爲道德實踐，他倡「知行合一」力生知識與行爲的聯緊，即如道德不僅以「知」爲滿足，必表現於實際的行爲。因知以堅其行，從行以實其知，這是合知行爲全部的學習過程。欲達到這種實踐的目的，便不得不注重敎材。陽明提出「歌詩」「習禮」和「讀書」。「歌詩」是「情緒敎育」，我國古代極重「詩敎」，它對激發意志和發抒性情有極大的功效，現在小學校的「唱遊」課程，價値亦同。「習禮］可說是一種「態度敎育」，使兒童能培養一種適當的態度，以增進其適應生活的能力。「讀書」是屬於「知識敎育」，知識對於日常生活固甚重要，但如離開實生活的訓練，仍不免失之偏倚。陽明注意兒童的情緒和態度是値得我們記取的。</p>
<p>陽明能深切了解兒童心理，他接着說：「大抵童子之情，樂嬉遊而憚　檢，如草木之始萌芽，舒展之則條達，摧撓之則衰萎。今敎童子必使之趨向鼓舞，中心喜悅。　之時雨春風，霑被草木，莫不萌動發越，自然日長月化；若冰霜剝落，則生意蕭索，日就枯槁矣。」　（朱完）</p>

<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>二三十年來我們對於傳統，對於現狀，似乎只有兩種看法和做法。一是革命，一是反動。維特傳統和維持現狀的是反動，而推總傳統和推翻現狀的是革命。在革命和反動間，似乎沒有第三條路。不革命就是反動，這是我們常常聽到的言說。但是否沒有第三條路呢？英國和美國現在就是想走第三條路的。美哲培黎氏（R．B．Perry）在所著「清敎主義與民主」（Pwritanism　and　Democracy）一書上即提出所謂第三條路。他說：「清敎主雜和民主，在這些或其他名義下，構成了美國人的遺產的主要部分。任何民族的精神培養，其主要來源必爲牠自己的過去，不斷重行發現和重新的過去。一民族若否定牠的傳統，牠即喪失了牠的歷史同一，毀滅了牠的精神活力的主要泉源。可是一民族若先是重行肯定牠的傳統，這一民族也可變爲無進步而腐化。不過我們却沒有在革命和反動間加以選擇的必要。我們是有三條路的。這第三條路就是鑑別而前瞻的忠實」。換句話說，培黎氏所謂第三條路，乃是對於傳統加以鑑別，區分其好或不好的原素，以作掃除或保留的標準。對於傳統，需要修改，却不需要全部的推翻。我們不能過份趨新，也不能過份守舊。任何民族都得有歷史的傳統，但任何民族也得修改其傳統。前進是站在傳統上而前進，不是離開傳統而前進。這話作者認爲極有注意的價值</p>

<p>遵義新志引言</p>
<p>國立浙江大學史地研究所，於民國廿八年八月成立，時校址在廣西宜山。旋桂南吿　，歲杪復北無還義。爾後環境較爲安定，研究工作乃獲　序進展。本所依學科性質分爲四組，日史學組，地形學組，氣象學組，人文地理學組。每年招收研究生。卅五年秋，本大學始遷回杭州，留遵義凡七年。在此期間本所各組導師及研究生致力於　　義之實地考察，舉凡地質，地形，氣候，土壤，人口，聚落，土地利用，產業，交通，民族，史蹟諸項，均作詳盡之研究，記錄頗慰，茲特彙爲一書，名曰「　義新志」，計十一章，都十七萬言，附地圖廿二幅。葉良輔敎授指導研究，斧正文稿，用力獨多。陳述彭君遵義相對高度之研究，在我國尙爲車創之作。土壤一章係請中央地質調查所馬溶之先生於卅五年盛夏爲之，灤誌謝意。譚其驤敎授著播州楊保考，於晚唐迄明代八百三十年間楊保之種族源流及建國始末，闡發幽潛，老證精確，實爲一重要文獻，已載本大學史地雜誌一卷三四合期（民國三十年九月出版）茲不轉錄。此外另有論文四十篇，稿存本所，限於篇幅未及一一刊佈，今附其目錄於本書之末。</p>
<p>遵義府志成於道光廿一年，爲鄭珍莫友芝所專輯，爲四十八卷，號稱精鍊周密，其後楊恩元趙愷纂輯，自道光廿二年迄於宣統三年之鄕邦事迹，爲續遵義府志，於民國廿五年吿成。邀義有此究備之志書，大足爲地方生色。順中國過去之方志，意在保存桑梓文獻，故其記載偏重於地方史料。此次本所編纂之遵義新志，大都爲地學著作，特重地圖之表現，與舊志體例不同，適足以補其所缺。而於民生利病尤所關條，例如土地利用一章，以民國廿九年陸地測量局出版之五萬分一地形圖爲粉本，根據實察資料，凡耕地，森林，荒地，道路，房屋之分佈，填繪於岡，加以解釋，並具建議。此項調查工作，由任美鍔敎授領導，陳述彭，趙松喬，施雅風，楊利普四君共任其事，自民國三十一年九月二十四日至十月二十七日，爲期一閱月，用費八千元。時本所經費僅敷日常應用，思想與時代社以節餘款項惠予資助，俾得完成斯舉，殊足銘感。此種土地利用圖之繪製，在我國尙屬首次，倘能普遍推行於各地，裨益建國大業，當非淺鮮。篇中關於遵義農業改良之若干結論，均本之田間目驗，實事未是，非但可供今後遵養地方建殺之準繩，且爲我廣大農村畫出一幅剖圖，深望我國言農政者留意及之。劉之遠敎授於民國三十年發現團溪溪礦，戰時重慶鋼鐵廠所　之錳，均就近仰給於此，關係今後西南工業建設甚鉅，亦一可資紀念之事也。（本書每册定價五十萬元，購者請逕函國立浙江大學史地研究所）</p>

<h3 id="c138">「法海精神」 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>昨大，孩子看了「白蛇傳」的戲回來，問我：「爲什麼法海和尙定要把白娘娘壓在塔裏呢？」</p>
<p>孩子才上學，他不懂得愛情的神聖和偉大，但他知道白娘娘的一切已經人格化了，她旣對於許仙並無惡意，則和尙實在無壓迫她或分離他們的必要。</p>
<p>是啊！爲什麼要壓迫她呢？</p>
<p>作爲和尙的人，倘是高僧，本來應該愛護一切生物，「冤親平等」，何必多管閒事，定要拆散好好在一起的一個人家，使白娘娘抱恨終天？</p>
<p>這悲劇的造成，在今天，我們可用佛羅伊德的精神分析學來解釋，動機是一稱意識的或非意識的嫉妒。</p>
<p>然而，人間世多的是專門寄生於離間和破壞的人，他們惟恐別人家和和氣氣，美滿一致，於是便專門製造蜚語，謠言，以蒙蔽當事人爲能事。對於這一種人，我們應不惜給予最大的憎惡，揭穿他們吃磨擦飯的卑劣的心理，然後天下事才有辦法。</p>

<h3 id="c139">怎樣收集世界名人的照片和手跡 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>在美國勃洛克林一座房子前面的一隻風雨剝蝕的信箱裏，時時可以收到世界上最驚人的信件。從那隻信箱的缺口裏投來了國王·王后·總統·主敎·獨裁者·將軍·諾貝爾獎金獲得者，以及甘地·邱吉爾·辛克萊·林白和愛因斯坦等名人的來信。</p>
<p>在這隻信箱後面，坐着世界上最出名的「筆跡」收集家——格林威。他不僅以一個簽名爲滿足，還要求得簽名者自認爲嚴得意的一張照片。結果是，他收集了六千個「歷史製造者」的照片和親筆簽名。</p>
<p>世界名人極少肯答應一個筆跡收集家的請求，更不會附寄一張親筆簽名的照片，但當格林威向他們提出要求的時候，却很少會便他失望。</p>
<p>他發覺，大多數名人都有一個容易進攻的弱點——他們的嗜好。所以，當他知道艾德禮首相喜歡做木工，朱可夫將軍收集勳章，邱吉爾喜歡銅鼓，昭和喜歡弄顯微鏡的時候，他便有技可施了。他打聽到名作家H·G·韋爾斯收集玩具兵，就送了他一套稀有的玩具兵——於是韋爾斯在感激之下立刻寄給他一張親筆簽名的照片。</p>
<p>溫莎公爵夫人對他的殺初十封信都置諸不理，但他寄給她一本貼報簿，裏面都是稱讚她這次婚事的新聞，他的要求便達到了</p>
<p>格林　接連向汽車大王福特和發明家愛她生寫了十一年的信才如願以償。當他向愛因斯坦的秘書指出他已寫了三百封信給那位科學家，要求一張親筆署名的照片的時候，那位秘書回信說：假如格林威能捐十塊美金給兒童牛奶基金，照片就可以寄來。他捐了十塊錢，愛因斯坦的簽名照片使來了</p>
<p>格林威所收集的照片的最大特色，是從那些照片上可以看出各個人的特性和嗜好。譬如說，羅斯福送給他的那張照片是羅斯福和他的夫人在爐邊閒談。托洛斯基送給他的照片是一張游泳照片，上面寫着「祝你康健，托洛斯基敬贈。」墨沙里尼是一張爬山照片，上面寫着：「一九二九是上帝年，也是墨沙里尼世紀第七年。」當格林威在一九三三年寫信給希特勒討照片的時候，希特勒送了他一張比墨沙里尼大兩倍的照片。</p>
<p>格林威說，「決不要在一個人成爲報紙頭絛新聞的時候去問他討照片。最好是幾個月以後寫去，那時，看到人家已經淡忘他而你還記得他，他便會高興地接受你的要求了。此外，今日的在野黨領袖可能是明日的首相，今日的參議員可能是明日的總統，未雨綢繆，也是一個好辦法。在名人的生日去要求簽名照片，多半不會使你失望。」</p>
<p>格林威在一九二一年開始收集簽名照片，現在，他的銀行保險箱裏存着六千張照片，其中包括凡爾賽和約的每一國代表，日本無條件投降的每一國代表，以原子彈轟炸日本的飛行員，紐倫堡的每一個納粹戰犯，以及最近五任的美國總統。</p>
<p>只有兩個世界名人使他毫無辦法，一個是小提琴名家克列塞，一個是史達林元帥。但他並不灰心。他說，當他收集到這兩個人的簽名照片的時候，他就覺得已十全十美了。</p>

<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>寗飲建業水，不食武昌魚。（三國時諺語）吾楚江魚名聞天下，已經幾千年了。自黃州至黃石港一百里水程，產魚最多最美。蘇東坡初到黃州，有詩「長江繞郭知魚美，好竹連山覺笋香。赤壁賦中有「舉網得魚，巨口細鱗，狀若松江之鱸」之句。張志和詞「西塞山前白鷺飛，桃花流水鱖魚肥」。（西塞山在黃石港附近，七名道上　。）有此名句，足為故鄕之魚生色。</p>
<p>我之老家爲　水縣之巴河，巴河濱江，適在黃州·黃石港之中間，昔日回鄕掃墓，族中人請吃飯，魚爲必備之品，或爲炒魚片，或爲魚餐（即魚圓），魚片以鱖魚製之，以其　骨也，魚餐以白魚製之，鮮而且嫩。白魚江湖中皆產之，大者長至四五尺，亦名陽　。說苑有「投綸錯餌迎而吸之者陽鐫也一。此爲余懷念鄕味之一。</p>
<p>黃州對江有西山，山中有寒溪寺，東坡謫黃州時、常以扁舟往游。西山下有樊口，是內湖與外江通達之口，亦猶湖口之迎絡鄱陽湖與長江也。樊口江湖相通之水間，產鳊魚最佳，頭小腹闊，名爲槎頭鳊，又曰遮角鳊。鄉人雖不善烹調，然以鳊魚用油炸透，再以松枝豐之，下酒最香，此魚之兩邊，最為腴美。詩經上「豈其食魚，必河之魴。」觔即　也，此爲余懷念鄕味之二。</p>
<p>湖北雲夢縣雖不濱江，然多湖。其地方人以湖中白魚摻以豆粉，製爲魚麵，或炒或煮皆佳，以螃蟹炒食，尤爲雋美。陳散原先生詩一左隻狂捐徒，躡踵肯共飯，家釀陶公種，鄕味許婆麵。」下有小註一酒生設雲夢魚麵，左叟稱爲乾隆中　尙書兆椿之母所創製，因號許婆麵」。此湖北之特產，爲余懷念鄕味之三。</p>
<p>民前余家居武昌時，每至年終，家中必製臘魚，親友各家買大靑魚或鯉魚，自數十斤以至二三百斤，以鹽醃若干日晒之，新年以之祀神供祖待客爲年菜。吃不完者切塊，以茶油泡之，至夏天，取出蒸食，味同火腿，淸潔而無流弊，勝於抗州紹興之靑魚乾。新年製臘魚時，靑魚腹中之子及肝與白，用蘿蔔絲炒食，人人可以盡量飽餐，此又爲余懷念鄕味之四。</p>
<p>武昌一帶有鳊魚，白色，背有肉　，無鱗，長者至二三尺，以之紅燒最佳，漢口有武鳴園菜館，製此最出名。又有鲇魚，頭大尾扁，無鱗，口曲而闊，大者長至二尺餘，以火腿扁尖香菌葷汕網蒸食，有清腴之味。此爲余懷念鄕味之五。</p>
<p>上海有廣東菜，四川菜，福建菜，有山東北平菜，寗波菜，有蘇館，有徽館，甚至有九如酒家及得味之湖南菜，獨無湖北菜，友人常以此相議。實則故鄉有一特別口味，即沔陽·天門一帶之蒸菜，鷄鴨魚肉，皆可加米粉蒸食。周沈觀姻丈請客，右粉蒸　魚一味，其味不下於錦江等川菜館中之小籠粉蒸牛肉，此爲余懷念鄉味之六。</p>

<h3 id="c142">臺灣曾神童 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 東方旣白</p>
<p>從前，山束歷城曾產生過一位神童江希張，九歲注解四書，一時轟動遐邇。但越到後來越糟樣，終於無聲無臭，默默無聞。</p>
<p>現在，合南也產生了一位神童曾臥石，在台灣早已家喻戶曉，無不嘖嘖稱讚。</p>
<p>曾神童今年才五歲，一班人皆呼之爲「五齡神童」。善書法，並能丹靑，當衆揮毫，了無難色。上月二十日台灣糖業公司福利會曾邀請曾神童到虎尾表演書畫，男女老少趕來參觀者，異常踴躍。神童着短衣褲，藍襪，黃皮鞋，神態活潑而自然，頗有旁若無人之概。紙筆墨硯事先已準備好了，神童跳上桌子，坐在紙上，手執大筆揮動起來，書一「壽」字，嗣又書一「虎」字，其部位，筆力，結構，無一不恰到好處，遠非一班成人所可企及。那小手怎會有偌大腕力？看樣子似非由練習而來。那一虎」字寫的是草書，最後的一筆拉得長可三尺許，並解釋說這是「虎尾」。又當衆爲某科長之女公子作蘭一幅，題詞云：「蘭爲王者香」，瀟洒有致，確屬難能。參觀的人，無不因這個五歲小孩子的聰明機靈而讚嘆，都認爲這是一種「奇蹟」。</p>
<p>曾神童無論到什麼她方，總有他的爸爸跟着照料一切。請作書畫必酬以相當代價。他的家庭經濟情况聽說很不好，生活很成問題，但自神童之大名一鳴驚人之後，以金錢餽贈者頗不乏人，生活大見好轉，公家求其深造，特輔助其求學，有助學金之規定。果能培植得宜，充分發展其特具的天才，將來一定能有所成就。可惜他的爸爸竟把神童當作了撈錢的資本，帶着孩子這兒表演，那兒表演，大做其買賣來了，表演一次索價若千，拍照一次又索價若干，簡直成了走江湖的賣藝人了。嘗讀古文，王安石之鄕人仲永，幼時聰敏絕頂，卒因被糟蹋，作踐，由荒廢而沒落。看情形，曾臥石這位可愛的小孩子，恐怕也走上這條黯淡的路了。（寫於台北）</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>近聞有日本漁輪在中國領海捕魚，被我方軍艦擊沉一艘，又提到個雲仙丸，此事大快人心，凡我國民都應暢舒一口氣。此口氣非爲此一事，實因倭燄盛時，在中國海陸任意橫行，旁若無人，蠻不講理，使我國人屢感高壓，吞聲忍氣，苦悶已久。就其近者言之，七七事變以前之兩年中，南北各處「走私，其政府且名之曰「特殊貿易」，每被海關或緝私船弋獲，則有倭韓浪人塵集搶奪，致我國法律無從執行，其領事則做好做歹，多方袒護，陰陽怪氣，極盡醜惡。而中國商人國家財政受其侵蝕，固不可數計，吾人讀報時時如見獰亞無賴之面目，祗以勢力不敵，氣鬱不伸，已非一朝一夕。就其遠者言之，如一九零八年之月，粵南領海，倭船二辰丸挾帶大宗私貨火藥等，還禁直駛內港，我寳璧兵輪管帶吳敬榮，依照海法禁阻不聽，登船查騐，據公約將船並貨押往虎門。粵督張人駿按海關會審章程，請駐粵日領會同審斷，日領悍然不理，其公使在北京反向外部大鬧，淸廷受嚇低頭，除飭粵督即行釋放日船，並賠償一切損失，又懲罰中國官員，凡彼所要挾，一一如命。此等惡而且醜之行爲，不但「以强權爲公理」，且以「鬼祟混强權」，雖憑勢力占得上風，而國際人格掃地，適戒其爲小鬼怪事。我國管帶吳君，以弱國偏裨，不計利害，不避艱險，執行職權，完成使命，雖事後受非理之屈抑，而智勇過人，中西人士同聲欽服，可占光榮國史之一頁。今則侵海之倭船被捕矣；倭犯受審矣；其私貨沒收矣；昔年請其領事會審尙不肯俯就，現在則中國官獨審獨斷矣。昔之覇道煞氣，而今安在？天網恢恢，疏而不漏，有如是哉！或曰，中國有昌言對日不取報復主義，表示「寬大」，子何悻悻，母乃小見乎？予曰：「寬大」與「不報復」，是當局諸公大國態度，自有不得已之衷曲，約而言之，道誼基礎，闕際關係，現實需要，非止一端，此處無須批評分析。此次中國海軍之捕私懲倭，乃執法而行，亦非有報復，然而「人是一口氣」，吾生平所見聞，所紀錄，倭人所施與中國之　橫苛慮，中國人數十年來，一而再，再而三，被壓迫得幾乎窒息，則於此次捉船捕私，審犯沒貨，快心之事，吐氣揚聲，略抒胸臆，亦屬情不自己。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Completion of Policy Consultation; President Weng to Give Comprehensive Reply Today; Legislators Urge No More "Headache Treatment for Headaches" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Weng Wenhao will give a comprehensive reply at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th regarding the inquiries made by legislators on his administrative policies. After the adjournment of the Legislative Yuan at 6:30 PM on the 14th, he invited the heads of various ministries and commissions to his official residence for dinner to discuss the opinions of the legislators and the content of the comprehensive reply on the 15th, which concluded around 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Legislative Yuan members' inquiries regarding the Executive Yuan's policy report, which took place over three days on the 11th, 12th, and 14th, involved 222 written and oral opinions. On the 14th, requests to speak were rejected by the meeting, bringing the heated and extensive inquiries to a close. All written records of the inquiries, which have already been sent to the Executive Yuan for individual written responses, will be followed by President Weng giving a comprehensive oral reply at the 12th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. It was also decided at the meeting on the 14th that if the members are not satisfied with the reply, they can submit further written inquiries, to which the Executive Yuan will provide written responses. President Sun also explained that the Executive Yuan's policy report and the legislators' inquiries were based on Article 57, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, which states that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and no resolution is required.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The 11th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 14th, continuing the inquiries into Premier Weng's administrative policies. The number of attending members was not as enthusiastic as in the previous two meetings, and the content of the speeches consisted more of political views than inquiries, with very few new or unique perspectives being raised. However, Premier Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions still listened patiently with great endurance. At the beginning of the morning session, after the minutes of the previous meeting were approved, President Sun reported on three provisional motions regarding procedures. The first motion was to immediately cease accepting applications for speeches and to proceed with those remaining from the previous day. The second motion was that written inquiries would no longer be read aloud but would be sent directly to the Executive Yuan for written responses, both of which were approved with applause. The third motion was to cease the inquiries and submit the members' opinions to the various committees for discussion, but it was not considered due to legal incompatibility. Oral speeches then resumed. Yin Shuxian believed that stabilizing prices should be one of the focal points of the administrative policy and inquired why health administration was not mentioned. Wu Shipeng, He Xinghan, Yang Baolin, Niu Jianchu, Yu Ruzhou, Miao Qiping, Deng Zhengtao, and others raised opinions on military suppression of the rebellion. Wu also inquired about the criteria for personnel selection. Huang Yuren inquired about three matters: (1) Given that the current situation cannot be remedied by simply treating the symptom ("treating the headache as a headache, and the foot pain as foot pain"), does the government have a comprehensive plan? (2) Going forward, the manipulation of politics by one or two individuals or families will not be tolerated. Is Premier Weng determined to pay attention to mobilizing the strength of the entire nation? (3) Is the Executive Yuan, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, making the Ministry of National Defense fully responsible for military operations? Or will it continue to pass the buck to people outside the Yuan, allowing a transcendent head of state to become involved in military affairs? Rong Zhao pointed out that since the government cannot but acknowledge the loss of Outer Mongolia in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, why does it not establish normal diplomatic relations? Does the government have specific plans for education and construction in the border regions? Jin Shaoxian asked if the government has thorough countermeasures against the banditry that caused today's chaotic situation? How will it ensure that the suppression of the rebellion is consistent with the provisions of Article 15 of the Constitution, which states that "the people's right to subsistence, right to work, and right to property shall be guaranteed"? Ma Runxiang raised the issue of currency reform again. Lin Mingjiu and Wu Yanhuan appealed for the refugees. Huang Guoben and Zhang Liyuan emphasized that the foundation of local autonomy should be laid. By noon, about twenty members had spoken. President Sun then proposed provisional motions related to procedures from Deng Hongye and others, believing that the inquiries had been very detailed, and advocated ceasing the inquiries and having Premier Weng and the heads of the subordinate departments respond orally at the afternoon meeting. Many members agreed, suggesting that bills could be submitted to the Yuan for discussion following the rules of procedure. However, due to the firm opposition of a few members who still wanted to speak, it was decided to make a decision at the afternoon meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12:00.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Price Frenzy in Shanghai; Why No Executive Yuan Response? A Series of Questions Accuses the Cabinet of Irresponsibility <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:30 PM. Deng Hongye revised his provisional motion and submitted it, to continue the inquiries that afternoon. Premier Weng and others were invited to attend the meeting on the morning of the 15th to reply, which was passed by the assembly without objection. Then, Wen Shiyuan and others successively expressed their opinions. Wen questioned why the liquidation of wealthy families' capital and the requisition of foreign deposits were not mentioned at all. Shan Qin asked why health administration was omitted from the report and said that the policy content was not sufficient to suppress the rebellion. Guo Zhongxing said: Since it is said that industrial production and construction will be increased, why neglect labor issues? Liu Wendao said: Strengthening the organization, training, and utilization of people's organizations at all levels is an essential element in implementing policies and should be given attention. Liu Butong raised a series of questions: The price frenzy in Shanghai, the Executive Yuan has no response, but the president sends someone to investigate; does the fact that Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression, appealed directly to the president to resign indicate that Premier Weng's responsible cabinet can no longer be responsible? Is attention being paid to supporting ethnic minority autonomy in the border regions? Is the policy of selling state-owned enterprises not being reconsidered and will it continue to be implemented? Why is diplomacy only showing passive actions? Why is the attitude towards the Soviet Union not being made clear? Liu Jianqun, after pointing out the three major political illnesses of the current situation: no source of money, no way out for people, and no spirit among officials, inquired whether the financial and economic situation would continue to condone collusion and corruption between officials and merchants? Would planned education still not be implemented in education? Would the connection between production and employment in society still not be given attention? Would the government continue to neglect the fundamentals and ignore official conduct in the military and political system, and only engage in superficial talk? Du Xunruo, Liang Surong, and others raised questions about local armed forces and emphasized that attention should be paid to military-political cooperation. Xue Xingru criticized the government for having no policy on Mongolia and said: There are 22 Mongolian legislators, "We represent tens of millions of people." Zhuang Jing raised her fist and shouted to change the 5,000-year-old tradition of valuing men over women! She questioned why the new government did not appoint female cabinet members. At 6:30 PM, all inquiries were completed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

The letter also stated: "I hope that you will be cautious in your words and deeds in the future, adhere to the labor standpoint, and strive for the interests of our workers." At the same time, the association telegraphed to the provincial and municipal federations of labor, explaining the association's decision on Mr. Sun's loss of standpoint in his speech.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] The US Senate Appropriations Committee will decide on the 14th whether to restore the original amount of $338.8 million for aid to China, as stipulated in the bill for twelve months, in order to overturn the vote of the House Committee last week, which cut $170 million. Well-informed sources say that the Senate will follow Wedemeyer's appeal to restore the original amounts for aid to China and Europe. Economic Cooperation Administration Executive Director Hoffman also warned the Senate Committee that the $338.8 million stipulated in the bill for twelve months is the minimum amount of aid. Hoffman stated that cotton worth US$13 million has now been allocated to China in accordance with the recovery plan, which is part of the total amount of US$97,616,005 approved for purchase by participating countries. At the same time, the amount allocated to China has reached $26,188,000. China and the European region can also obtain industrial materials such as aluminum, copper, zinc, and lead.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Lapham, Stillman, and their party flew to Beijing yesterday morning.

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Regarding the issue of US aid utilization, after Zheng Daoru, Yan Jiagan, etc. consulted with Lapham, Stillman, etc. in Shanghai in recent days, both parties have put forward some information. In addition to providing information on the utilization of US aid, our side also specially explained the current economic crisis in China, hoping that US aid can be used quickly. Lapham and Stillman have a deeper understanding of the current situation in China, but because the Sino-US bilateral agreement has not yet been signed, formal utilization must be after the bilateral agreement is signed. Lapham and Hoffman are making various efforts to restore the $63 million in aid to China cut by the House of Representatives to its original amount, which will still be disbursed in twelve months. Lapham has reported some information about China to the US media. As for the principle of using US aid, the United States still hopes that China can complete its self-help plan and improve international trade to increase foreign exchange income, so that the international balance of payments will gradually balance and produce a stable economic effect.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Sino-American Relief Material Disposal Committee has been scheduled to end at the end of June and merge into the US Aid Utilization Committee. The American China Relief Work Team is also scheduled to end at the end of June.</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Key to the Success or Failure of Currency Reform <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Su Jicang</p>
<p>The theater changed, and Yu Wenshi Jue Ming formed a cabinet. Everyone expected the government to have new measures in the economic and financial aspects, especially currency reform, which may enter the stage of quasi-storage theory from the stage of research and design. Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank, was sent to the United States twice, and it is said that he carried a detailed plan for currency reform to discuss with the US authorities and plead for assistance. Judging from various signs, currency reform may be the most important new economic initiative during the Ong cabinet's tenure, and its success or failure may be a major key to determining whether China's economy can be temporarily stabilized or further deteriorated in the future. We believe that the currency system is deeply and greatly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The government must have a thorough plan beforehand, and especially must have the determination and perseverance to overcome all difficulties and adhere to the end. The authorities must not regard currency reform as a temporary emergency measure in finance, used to earn small profits in the short term, and not make long-term plans in the economy. By reading the history of currency reform in various countries, we can know that the real difficulty of currency reform lies not in designing a perfect monetary system, but in how to maintain and stabilize this system. The establishment of a country's monetary system should mainly be based on the principle of "self-reliance" and cannot rely solely on external assistance. However, in the current process of brewing currency reform, we have discovered several erroneous views and dangerous tendencies:</p>
<p>First, some people believe that the so-called currency reform is only aimed at replacing the existing legal currency with a new currency, unifying the name and layout of the current currency, and lowering the unit to facilitate transactions and accounting. Those who take this view only pay attention to the form of currency reform and ignore the substance of currency reform - ignoring the impact that the currency system can have on the social economy. This view is incorrect. Today's currency reform in China is not only aimed at establishing a complete monetary system, but more importantly, it is to use currency reform to save the entire financial and economic crisis. In other words, we must regard currency reform as a financial and economic policy to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, restore economic normality, and correct the phenomenon of uneven distribution of social wealth. To achieve these goals, we must not only pay attention to the technology of currency reform, but also use the opportunity of new currency to replace old currency to freeze, tax, confiscate, or transfer the use of most of the assets, and stipulate various different exchange rates, applicable to all classes of people. In this way, we can achieve the following effects in finance and economy. (1) Reduce the amount and speed of currency circulation; (2) Increase national treasury revenue; (3) Enrich production and construction funds; (4) Correct the uneven distribution of wealth caused by inflation. Frankly speaking, when talking about currency reform in today's China, it is of little significance and will never succeed if it is not used as a means to save the financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p>Second, the current inflation in China has reached an extremely dangerous stage, and the social economy is on the verge of total collapse. If currency reform fails, the serious consequences are truly unimaginable. Therefore, currency reform is only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. We will not talk about currency reform if we do not talk about it, otherwise we must use the greatest determination and courage to stabilize the value of the new currency, which is the key to the success or failure of the entire reform work. To stabilize the value of the new currency, the government must take the following parallel measures when starting currency reform: (1) Collect and redeem all gold, silver, and foreign currencies owned by Chinese people, and use long-term, low-interest government bonds to borrow deposits from Chinese people abroad to enrich the reserve of the new currency; (2) Encourage exports, restrict imports, strive for remittances from overseas Chinese, and reduce all unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures to seek a balance in international payments; (3) Expand and increase the collection of taxes (profit tax, inheritance tax, land price tax, land value increment tax, etc.), especially the long-awaited property tax must be earnestly implemented. At the same time, in terms of reducing expenditures, we should drastically reduce the number of troops, abolish unnecessary administrative agencies and inefficient state-owned enterprises to seek a balance in the current financial revenue and expenditure; (4) Strictly implement the budget and final account system; Make public finance transparent, issue currencies cautiously, publish issuance figures regularly, and publicly inspect the issuance reserve to strengthen people's confidence in the new currency; (5) Strengthen the central bank so that it can effectively take on the responsibility of managing currency, controlling foreign exchange, and regulating finance. It is inevitable that the implementation of the above measures will be subject to many constraints, but at this time when the crisis of total economic collapse is imminent, if the government still has the awareness to save itself and save the people, then it should come up with the spirit of "a brave man breaking his wrist" and "killing relatives righteously"!</p>
<p>Third, foreign aid is naturally beneficial to a country's currency reform, and therefore obtaining foreign aid is also necessary. However, foreign aid can only be utilized and not relied upon, because foreign aid is not inexhaustible, and the acquisition of foreign aid is not unconditional. If we do not have a self-reliant solution, needless to say, 300 or 500 million US dollars will not be enough to consume, even 1 billion or 800 million US dollars will not last long. At the beginning of our victory, didn't we also have 800 or 900 million US dollars and 5 or 6 million taels of gold? However, how long did it take before the national treasury became empty and we relied on issuing banknotes and borrowing money to survive. The authorities seem to be placing the hope of currency reform entirely on US loans, and are rarely making active innovative preparations in the domestic economy and finance. We feel that this is not like reforming the currency system, but just wanting to use this to obtain a foreign debt to tide over the current financial difficulties. If our observation is correct, then the future of currency reform is difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Around the Dragon Boat Festival - Miscellaneous Notes from Changzhou: Famine Year, Thin Wheat Ears; Chaotic World, Fragile Life and Death <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wujin, 13th] Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the wheat ears were at a critical moment of growth, and suddenly there was a rainstorm. The next morning, the weather was clear and the sun was as hot as fire. The young wheat wilted under this one wet and one scorched condition. This year is a genuine year of wheat famine, and farmers are sighing.</p>
<p>Once the Dragon Boat Festival passed, the price of rice went straight from the 8 million mark to the 9 million mark. On the morning of the 13th, the black market was already 10 million per stone. Unscrupulous grain merchants were secretly laughing. Thousands of stones of white rice are transported out every day, transported to this inexplicably named area of northern Jiangsu. Since last winter, the price of rice has always exceeded Wuxi, and even Shanghai. The direction of transportation has reversed from Shanghai and pointed to the northwest. In the future, the rice in Shanghai and Wuxi may flow back to Changzhou, but this loophole has not been noticed.</p>
<p>Bai Guoliang, a farmer from Linggang Township outside the East Gate, is 28 years old this year. On the afternoon of the 12th, he went to the field to cut wheat, when an inexplicable bullet flew over, entered his back and exited his abdomen. He screamed, fell in a pool of blood, and died immediately. It is said that the bullet was fired by a certain unit practicing target shooting. The villagers were weak and unable to negotiate, so Bai Guoliang just flew away in vain!</p>
<p>Zhou Zugen, who runs a small restaurant in Xijie, Qishuyan, is honest and sincere. He was working in the restaurant on the Dragon Boat Festival when a strange guest suddenly came. Just as he was receiving the guest, the guest picked up a kitchen knife on the table, and without saying a word, chopped at Zugen. Immediately, blood flowed like a fountain. He frantically shouted for help. Neighbors rushed over and snatched the kitchen knife. Zugen was seriously injured and fainted, while the murderer did not say a word and frequently foamed at the mouth. He was like an idiot, and his origin was unknown. Yesterday, he was sent to the city for interrogation, but nothing was found out. It is truly "God knows"!</p>
<p>Pan Xiyuan and Pan Xilin, hooligan residents of Meigang Township, usually do not engage in honest work. They extort the villagers and commit all kinds of evil. Recently, they coveted Wu Ruichang, a resident of the same place, who had a little savings, so they pretended that Wu's wife was not his first wife, intending to extort money. When they failed, they colluded with Qian Xisheng, the head of the township, and illegally detained Wu's wife and Wu's friend, subjecting them to severe torture and hanging, causing them to be covered in bruises, and detaining them for four days. Wu had no choice but to file a complaint with the Self-Defense Force. The case is currently under investigation. The countryside is truly dark and without sunlight. (Our reporter Li Tianxing)</p>

<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 14th] Reports say that although smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong has gradually subsided, smuggling between Hong Kong and Shanghai is becoming more rampant. A large smuggling company, each time it smuggles, the value of the goods reaches HK$2 million. The company pays the consignor a full deposit for the goods. After the goods arrive safely in Shanghai, they ask to retrieve the deposit, with an additional 70% to 100% of the shipping fee.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Huaiyin, 12th] The suppression war in northern Jiangsu has come to an end. After more than a month of encirclement and suppression by the two powerful armies of the National Army, the entire Second Column of bandits has been routed back to southern Shandong after suffering heavy blows. At present, only the remnants of the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns of bandits remain in the northern Jiangsu area, wandering in the coastal area and the Hongze Lake area, with no more ability to move. For the past half month, the reporter has followed the army deep into the bandit area, traveling between the Sheyang River Basin and the Shu River Basin, and entering the old nest of Hede Town, which has been occupied by bandits for more than ten years. Along the way, I saw farmers rushing to harvest wheat under the protection of the National Army, and saying that this year's wheat harvest is the best in twelve years. The deeper I went into the bandit area, the more barren land there was, and the fewer people there were in the rural areas. For dozens of miles of marching, there was no trace of human habitation, and only broken buildings and ruins were seen. The area east of the Tongyu Line was originally a very good reclamation area, but now there are thousands of acres of weeds. Hede Town has only 600 elderly and weak residents. Many of the original factories had their machinery dismantled by the Communist bandits. Everywhere it shows the Communist bandits' means of only caring about destruction and not construction, and being hostile to the people. The hanging of the Soviet flag in the bandit area and the forced cultivation of opium by the people between the Lian and Shu areas further reveal the Communist bandits' dangerous scheme of selling the country and poisoning the people.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 12th] Song Guobin, former professor of physiology at Aurora University and chairman of the Shanghai Medical Association, is deeply interested in Yang Mei's nine-year fasting issue. He believes that such news has historical precedents and is possible, and does not violate science. His views are particularly valuable, and are hereby published as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Mei's fasting has lasted for nine years, and has been reported extensively, causing a stir both at home and abroad. Some believe it is bizarre and unbelievable, violating science and impossible to believe. Others see it as an unprecedented miracle, a once-in-a-millennium event with research value. The Chongqing Municipal Health Authorities conducted tests, proving: (1) She has indeed not eaten for three weeks, only drinking a small amount of clear water daily. (2) Her weight and body temperature have not shown a significant continued decline. (3) She has not had a bowel movement in three weeks, only urinating a few times. (4) Her body is thin, but there are no signs of exhaustion. (5) Her life is leisurely, with no strenuous work. I would like to briefly express my views on this as follows:</p>
<p>There are two types of fasting: complete fasting and incomplete fasting. Complete fasting means absolutely no food intake. In this case, the body temperature will drop daily, and the weight will decrease. When the weight decreases by 40% and the body temperature drops to 23 or 24 degrees, death will occur immediately, with no hope of survival. Incomplete fasting involves gradually reducing food intake until only water and a small amount of fruit are consumed daily. The weight and body temperature will also gradually decrease, but will stop at a certain level. This is because the intake of water and fruit can maintain the minimum metabolism. This type of incomplete fasting is also known as "bi gu" (avoiding grains), or "jue li" (abstaining from grains). Yang Mei's fasting probably belongs to this category. In ancient times, those who sought immortality would sit quietly in the deep mountains, eating only a few fruits a day and still maintain their lives. This is not without reason. When one is still and without thought, the body's consumption and needs are reduced to a minimum. Fruits and water also contain considerable nutrients. The body has an adaptive function, and over time, this minimum nutritional value can supplement its minimum life needs. Therefore, while achieving immortality is impossible, abstaining from grains is not difficult. Mo Youzhi [a Qing Dynasty scholar] wrote an ancient poem in his "Shao Ting Yi Wen" about a widow in her thirties who, after her husband's death, vowed to abstain from grains, drinking only a small amount of water daily. She lived like this for fifty years and died at the age of eighty. There are historical precedents, it is not absurd or unbelievable, and it is possible and does not violate science.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The city's security authorities successively cracked two underground organizations in Beiping belonging to the Communist Party's Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Public Security Administration in late May. The hidden Communist spies distributed in the Beiping-Tianjin area have all been arrested, totaling 57 male and female criminals, making it the most important case cracked this year. The Beiping Garrison Headquarters today continued to release the details of the entire case as follows:</p>
<p>Source of Clues: In January of this year, the security authorities received reports from within the Communist Party that the Communist Party's Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau had dispatched a senior official, Yang, to Beiping to arrange underground work. He also attempted to infiltrate the Special Criminal Court to cover up espionage activities and control the court's handling of cases involving Communist spies. After receiving the report, the security authorities investigated and confirmed that Yang belonged to the system of the Communist leader Kang An and had the power to approve party members' membership and adjust the organization. The case was very important, so a surveillance network was deployed to closely monitor it in order to catch them all in one swoop. At the same time, it was learned that Chen Yinghua (also known as Minying), a female Communist spy sent by Jin-Cha-Ji, was also active in Beiping. Therefore, agents were sent to infiltrate Chen's organization with Communist Party credentials to gain her trust. They successively obtained important documents and blueprints for new wireless radios, photographed them as evidence. Our agents were also ordered to purchase and store radio equipment for the Communist Party for the purpose of setting up a radio station, and they pretended to agree, waiting for the right opportunity.</p>
<p>The Cracking Process: By the end of last month, the investigation was largely completed, and the crackdown was launched. After careful arrangements, action was taken at midnight on the 27th. First, the senior Communist official Yang was arrested at the Baoguang Electrical Repair Shop at No. 6, Jia, Beixin Hua Street. A list of his subordinates, personnel of party and youth league organizations, economic investigation outlines, and various other important documents and reactionary propaganda publications were found. After interrogation, he confessed to all organizational relationships. At the same time, the female Communist Chen Yinghua and her subordinates Jin Keyan, Yan Guangyu, Guo Datong, Liang Xiuwen, Ma Xitian, Yao Kuanmin, Li Baogui, Gao Xiongfei and other eight people were also arrested together. Intelligence data, manuscripts, motors, drawings, electrical materials, codebooks, maps of mining areas of the Hebei Provincial Highway Bureau, route maps for emergency repairs of the Highway Bureau, etc., were found in the homes of the respective criminals, and were taken along with the cases for detailed investigation. The following details of the above-mentioned Communist criminals' activities were learned:</p>
<p>Activities: The female Communist Chen Yinghua was under the command of the Communist Party's Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Public Security Administration. Jin Keyan stole our army's secret codebook and maps of mining areas of the Highway Bureau, route maps for emergency repairs. Yan Guangyu supplied military intelligence from Xuanhua. Guo Datong frequently traveled between the Communist areas and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Political Department, contacting Hu Ang, Ma Xia and others. Liang Xiuwen and Ma Xitian jointly designed and drew wireless radio diagrams, practiced sending and receiving reports, and prepared to take on telecommunications work. Yao Kuanmin contacted personnel coming and going from the Communist areas and stored radio equipment. Li Shigui and Gao Xiongfei were guided by Chen to plan and respectively take on work. All have confessed without denying. In Tianjin, those arrested included Wang Youzheng, the leader of the typewriter factory led by Huang Weiren, Wang Zhenru of the Changlu Nursery, Li Yexin of the Xinshibao, Li Tiejun, the chief clerk of the Municipal Finance Bureau, and Fang Boru and other six people. All of the above-mentioned criminals have solid evidence, either as Communist Party members or in contact with the Communist Party, and have also confessed. There is also Ma Junwu, a Communist Party member who is currently a prosecutor in the local court. He participated in the Special Criminal Court and was introduced by him, and he came to Beiping to contact Yang, and was also arrested. In total, 57 male and female Communist criminals have been arrested successively. The investigation of this case has come to an end for the time being, and the entire case will be transferred to the court for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Japanese Cabinet in a Precarious Situation, Huge Budget Strongly Opposed, Ashida Hopes US Aid Will Arrive Soon <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Most official sources believe that Ashida's coalition cabinet has begun to waver due to facing a series of difficulties, and may collapse before the US aid to help Japan's economic recovery arrives. Ashida personally hopes that this fund, totaling billions, can be disbursed to Japan before July 1st.</p>
<p>The Ashida cabinet had earlier encountered strong opposition with its unprecedentedly huge budget for 1948-49. This budget, totaling 400 billion yen, will therefore lead to universal price increases, such as train tickets increasing by three and a half times, and postage and telephone charges increasing by four and a half times. The political attack on Deputy Prime Minister Nishio has further plunged the Ashida cabinet into trouble. Some opposition members of the Diet have requested the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office to take action against Nishio, accusing him of violating the election law because he accepted a donation of 500,000 yen before last year's election and did not register with the authorities. However, under the current legal procedures, if the prosecutor intends to prosecute Nishio, he must first obtain the prime minister's approval.</p>
<p>The Ashida cabinet has recently faced another labor problem. The Public Utility Workers' Union, which has one million members, has requested the government to increase the basic salary to 3,200 yen per month [equivalent to 40 US dollars], an increase of 2,000 yen from the current level. Observers generally believe that the government cannot accept this.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th] According to reports in Tokyo newspapers this morning, Prime Minister Ashida has decided to submit his resignation in the near future. Although the superficial excuse for his resignation is the Nishio incident, the main reason is the fierce opposition from the Democratic Liberal Party, led by Yoshida, to the budget currently being discussed in the Diet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese Minister of State Sadakichi Ichimatsu said in Osaka today that the Nishio issue will naturally cause a cabinet reshuffle. If this reshuffle cannot proceed smoothly, it is feared that the Diet will have to be dissolved and a new election held. In short, whatever the method, it must be decided within the next two or three days.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Four gallows are currently being built in Sugamo Prison in Japan. Allied officials have also taken all possible preventive measures to prevent Tojo and other major Japanese war criminals from escaping or committing suicide before hearing the verdict of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] It was announced on the 14th that the issue of the Japanese peace treaty has been delayed for so long that people have almost forgotten about it, and there is no hope of a resolution before the end of the year or even next year. Reliable sources said that unless there is a major breakthrough in the differences between the East and West, a peace treaty with Japan cannot be considered anytime soon. Although factors other than the "Cold War" can still hinder a formal Far East peace conference, officials here feel indifferent about initiating the Japanese peace treaty, and the issue has been shelved indefinitely.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 14th] The Manila Times published a sharp editorial directly questioning the US State Department's explanation of "why Japan's economic recovery must be supported to self-sufficiency," stating: "What 70 million Japanese people have obtained is something that the other billion or so people in Asia have not." The newspaper continued, "Most of East Asia's resources are outside Japan, and most of East Asia's people are also outside Japan. If the plan to rebuild Japan's economy could be turned to rebuild the vast area of East Asia, it would have a better impact on the economic stability of the Far East, and would also provide fairer treatment to the various related ethnic groups, otherwise, it will bring endless disasters." The newspaper added: "Konoe is dead, but his spirit remains, even in the US State Department. And Konoe's dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is still alive and well, right next to the south side of the White House."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Schumann's government's struggle to get Congress to approve the London Six-Power Conference resolution is showing increasing promise after stepping up off-site activities over the weekend. It is expected that when Bidault responds to the debate in Congress on Tuesday or Wednesday, he will be able to overcome congressional doubts about the Six-Power Agreement with a more positive attitude than last Friday.</p>
<p>Bidault argued that the London Conference resolutions must be accepted as is, while Prime Minister Schumann, who is more politically experienced, argued that France must reserve the opportunity to continue consultations with Western powers when interpreting or applying the London Conference recommendations. Schumann also confirmed that there were indeed some ways to make the French people feel that France was not in danger of being invaded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] De Gaulle gave a speech in Nevers, central France, today, pointing out that the London Six-Power Conference agreement has exposed the weaknesses of the Schumann government. He said that this agreement is nothing less than another warning to France, proving that officials in the current French regime are trying to get France to accept unnecessary concessions. These concessions will prevent France from obtaining what it deserves, and will also prevent France from contributing to European peace.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Supporting Japan's Economic Recovery: The Johnston Plan Contents Include Reducing Reparations and Foreign Investment <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 13th] Five leading American businessmen have laid the groundwork for an American plan for Japan's economic recovery, which can be implemented regardless of whether a peace treaty with Japan is signed. This plan is titled "Report on the Economic Status and Future of Japan and Korea, and Necessary Measures to Improve Japan-Korea Relations," totaling fifty-one pages. It is the result of a two-week visit to Japan and Korea by Johnston (Chairman of Chemical Bank &amp; Trust Company), Hoffman (Chairman of Studebaker Corporation), Lawley (New York Banker), and Scotcha (a prominent New York textile industrialist) at the end of April this year. This delegation to Japan and Korea was led by US Under Secretary of the Army Draper, but he did not sign the report. Hoffman was subsequently appointed as the administrator of the US foreign aid program.</p>
<p>Three Prerequisites</p>
<p>The Johnston Report is more extensive than the previous six industrial surveys of Japan, covering the entire scope of Japan's recovery, from reducing Japanese reparations to the hope for foreign investment in Japan. This recommendation is based on the following three prerequisites:</p>
<p>(1) An industrialized Japan is an economic and strategic asset to the United States.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese self-sufficiency could reduce the US burden by $400 million annually.</p>
<p>(3) Japan's becoming an exporting nation can assist in the recovery of the entire Far East.</p>
<p>Six Recommendations</p>
<p>For the above purposes, the report recommends:</p>
<p>(1) Increasing Japan's current export levels by eight or nine times, so that Japan can pay for imported food and raw materials, which is necessary to maintain a "reasonable standard of living" in Japan.</p>
<p>(2) Japan should be encouraged to build ships and purchase or lease ships to increase its maritime transport. The current ban on Japan building ships over 6,000 tons should be lifted.</p>
<p>(3) Trade between Japan and its former enemy country, China, should be restored for the mutual benefit of both parties.</p>
<p>(4) Japan should obtain food or other raw materials from its neighboring countries, as it did before the war. Therefore, officialdom regarding Japan's foreign trade should be reduced, so that Japanese merchants can directly contact foreign commercial firms.</p>
<p>(5) The final settlement of reparations should be the provision of war factories and equipment worth $280,561,750 to the victorious nations. This compensation is converted at an exchange rate of four Japanese yen to one US dollar in 1939.</p>
<p>According to the report, if this recommendation is implemented, the total amount of factory equipment and machine tools provided for reparations will be lower than the level proposed by Overseas Consultants, Inc. In other words, this recommendation will be the lowest among the Japanese reparations proposals.</p>
<p>(6) Due to the instability of the Japanese currency, establishing an exchange rate for the Japanese yen is impossible, and the "military exchange rate" of 50 yen to one US dollar should be revised and applied to new foreign investments.</p>
<p>A Careful Report</p>
<p>The report also cautiously advises that any foreign investment in Japan should be subject to "substantial supervision" by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and the Japanese government, to protect investors from discriminatory tax laws and the encompassing of commercial firms.</p>
<p>Regarding assisting Japanese exports, the report emphasizes that the more loans to Japan, the better, so that Japan can purchase raw materials and sell manufactured goods abroad.</p>
<p>After Japan signs a peace treaty, Japan should pass laws to attract foreign investment.</p>
<p>The report also points out that Japan's historical role is that of an exporting nation. It also advocates that Japan use US cotton to make cotton textiles for sale in the US market, but this step has been fiercely opposed by US cotton textile manufacturers.</p>
<p>The report does not list the measures that the United States should take, but strictly orders the Japanese government to balance its budget. Japan has been in deficit on its budget since 1930-1931, and the main reason for Japan's inability to balance its budget is the continuous inflation that dominates today's economic situation.</p>
<p>The Korean Issue</p>
<p>The report concludes by stating that the future of the Korean economy depends on the development of experienced industrial leaders and technical personnel, as Korea lacks such talent due to forty years of Japanese imperialist rule. The solution to this problem is to hire high-level American consultants, but this is not easy, so the Korean government should seek to obtain technical and guidance talent from Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Grain Chiefs Arrive in Shanghai to Discuss Suppressing Rice Prices: Report at a Press Conference Held at the Municipal Government Yesterday; Government Decides to Continue Rice Rationing; Shanghai Market Supply is Ample, No Need to Panic <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Minister of Food Kuan Chi-yu, due to the recent drastic fluctuations in grain prices in this city, was ordered by Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan to come to Shanghai yesterday to discuss ways to suppress prices with Mayor Wu and Ku Fang. Minister Kuan and Mayor Wu held a press conference at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 5 pm yesterday. Minister Kuan reported that the government has decided to continue the food rice distribution for Shanghai citizens. The government's current rice reserves are ample, the source is absolutely no problem, and there is confidence in controlling rice prices, so it is hoped that citizens will not panic and will cooperate with the government.</p>
<p>Minister Kuan first clarified that the key to the food problem lies in "quantity" and "price": (1) In terms of rice quantity - does the government have enough food rice for Shanghai citizens to eat? The current facts prove that the government's rice reserves are sufficient. The rice ration amount for July should be 500,000 piculs, and the rice owned by the municipal treasury has exceeded this number. Therefore, the citizens' panic should be eliminated. (2) In terms of rice prices - the recent fluctuations in rice prices have been entirely caused by public panic, because citizens doubt whether the government will continue rice rationing after July. Now that the government has decided to continue, rice prices will definitely stabilize. Minister Kuan believes that the current rise in rice prices is an occasional phenomenon, and he guarantees that the government has absolute confidence in controlling rice prices.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Issue Written Statement <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Minister Kuan left in a hurry after speaking for only ten minutes yesterday due to other important matters, and reporters could not even get a chance to ask questions. He issued a pre-printed written statement, the content of which is as follows: "Recently, Shanghai's grain prices have fluctuated. I was ordered by Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan to come to Shanghai to have detailed discussions with Mayor Wu and all parties. Currently, new wheat has already entered the market, autumn rice planting is even more widespread and good, and US aid purchases of foreign rice and wheat are arriving in China one after another. Although there are other related factors in commodity prices, this phenomenon should not occur. The distribution of food rice to Shanghai citizens has been successful for four months, and the government has decided to continue it, and will hold meetings to review and improve it, striving to achieve the purpose of rational distribution. In addition, more than 550,000 shih (units of dry measure) of grain sources have been raised for Shanghai's July ration, and preparations are sufficient, so there is absolutely no problem. In addition, Shanghai's food supply for the above rationed grain and the supply of grain for public education projects has reached about 70% of the total demand of Shanghai. In addition, there are also a considerable amount of flour and miscellaneous grains, so there is absolutely no need to worry about food for Shanghai citizens. If there is any deliberate manipulation or price gouging, the Mayor Wu has already discussed countermeasures to stabilize prices and will coordinate the handling of it at any time."</p>
<h3 id="e65">Director Jen Personally Supervises Rice Prices in North and South Markets <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu announced at the reception yesterday that in order to accurately suppress rice prices, the authorities have consulted with the chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee and decided that from today, Director Jen will personally go to the north and south rice markets every day to closely monitor rice prices. If rice prices continue to rise, the government has decided to release large quantities of rice when necessary. Mayor Wu firmly believes that after the news of the government's decision to continue rice rationing is officially announced today, rice prices will definitely be suppressed. He also stated that the government has great determination regarding the rice rationing policy. The rationing date will not only be one or two months, but will be maintained for at least four months or more.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Social Bureau Discusses Fundraising for Relief Special Donations: Business Community Expresses Willingness to Assist to the Best of Their Ability, and Should Start with Wealthy Capitalists First <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Social Bureau convened more than thirty responsible persons from the local business community yesterday morning to discuss the issue of fundraising for relief special donations. According to the attendees, they will definitely assist the government to the best of their ability in the relief special donations. However, under the heavy burden of taxes and donations today, the business community is already overwhelmed. A donation amount of 850 billion is too large, and it will be difficult to meet the amount by the end of June. It should start with wealthy capitalists first, and the business community will strive to follow behind.</p>
<p>As for the fundraising targets for the relief special donations and the standards for auditing donation amounts, the municipal government has formulated them, and the following are excerpts: Fundraising targets: (1) People who have held or currently hold important military and political positions and are wealthy should take the lead in making donations to set an example. (2) The fundraising targets of the fundraising committees in each fundraising district should be based on the following standards: 1 Those who have managed well and are wealthy during the War of Resistance and the Suppression of the Rebellion, 2 Major merchants and wealthy individuals, 3 Corporate legal entities with strong financial resources and developed business, (3) Any natural person with more than 5 billion in family assets must donate at least one-tenth of their total family assets, and any legal person with assets worth more than 10 billion must donate at least one-twentieth of their total assets. (4) If any designated donor has any objection, they may request the fundraising committee of the relevant district to re-examine it, but if the fundraising committee believes after review that the donor has the ability to bear the burden, they should still pay the full amount. (5) The fundraising committees of each district should use effective methods to raise funds.

<h3 id="e69">Gas Station on the Bund Changes Hours of Sale <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The congestion at gas stations has been unprecedented recently, especially in the area near the Bund. Due to the rush of vehicles refueling, traffic during daily office hours has become even more difficult. The Municipal Utilities Bureau and the Municipal Police Bureau jointly issued a notice to all gas stations in this area yesterday, stipulating that the time for selling gasoline must start from 3 pm from today onwards, in order to avoid increasing traffic difficulties during office hours in the morning and afternoon. However, many vehicles were unaware of this new regulation in advance yesterday and still went to the gas station early in the morning. As a result, they all had to wait until 3 pm. Therefore, the vehicles parked along the streets of Chung-cheng East Road, Szechuan Road, and Honan Road formed a long queue, and the congestion was even worse than in the past. It is hoped that the new measure will have an improved effect after it is known to the public from today onwards. The gas stations that will implement this new measure are: Texaco Gas Station at 157 Tibet Road Central, Texaco Gas Station at the intersection of Honan Road and Foochow Road, Asia Gas Station at the intersection of Szechuan Road and Chung-cheng East Road, Asia Gas Station at 85 Nanking Road East, Mobil Gas Station at 11 Szechuan Road, Mobil Gas Station at the intersection of Szechuan Road and Chung-cheng East Road, and Mobil Gas Station at 119 Soochow Road.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Anti-Support Japan Parade: Eight-Point Interrogation; Mayor Announces Final Deadline <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu learned yesterday that the Student Self-Government Association of Chiaotung University did not intend to respond to the second letter of inquiry issued by the Municipal Government, and expressed its willingness to accept summons, but proposed two conditions, and was deeply dissatisfied. He made some criticisms at the press conference yesterday afternoon. Wu said: The eight-point inquiry I raised are the simplest factual questions. If Chiaotung University does not respond, it is tantamount to publicly acknowledging that the anti-American support for Japan parade was manipulated behind the scenes, a small number of people hijacked the public, and engaged in a planned conspiracy to disturb public order in the name of patriotism. If the students are indeed out of pure patriotic sincerity, they will definitely be able to answer candidly. He guarantees absolute openness and will disclose the reply in various newspapers. Wu also announced that this Saturday is the final deadline.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Trial Will Definitely Be Public; Measures Will Be Announced Separately <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Chiaotung University Student Self-Government Association's expression of "willingness to accept summons," the Mayor found it very ridiculous, because summons is originally the power of the police bureau, and there is no such thing as "accepting" or "not accepting." Even if the students are unwilling, they must be forced to "accept." As for the two conditions proposed by the Self-Government Association, one is to request a public summons. Mayor Wu has repeatedly stated that the summons will be absolutely public. However, the students' second point, "allowing students from various schools who participated in the anti-American support for Japan parade to testify," Wu believes is another attempt to make an issue out of it. He said: During the court hearing of the last Shang Fa incident, hundreds of students gathered outside the court to listen, and as a result, they shouted slogans and sang the song "You, you bad thing." Fearing the recurrence of this phenomenon, the second point proposed by the students is difficult to approve. However, Wu said that there are other public measures that will be announced before the summons in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Detailed List Existed Long Ago <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu finally reported that the Municipal Government has given a list to Chiaotung University, instructing them to circle the names of those who supported the parade next to the names of the representatives of each department, for investigation. However, Wu expressed doubt about whether Chiaotung University can do it. He said: "It doesn't matter whether they circle them or not. I already have a detailed list of the initiators. I am engaging in a war of nerves with them to see where the professional communist students will escape to?"</p>

<p>On the 5th of this month, the Songhu Garrison Command captured a suspicious person similar to a soldier from the ranks of the "Anti-American Support for Japan" parade launched by some college students in the city. He joined the ranks and shouted loudly to command. He has been interrogated by the department, and various facts about participating in communist work were found in his diary. According to the confession, another suspect, Chen Kang, was captured, and many communist propaganda materials were found in his home. The department has decided to transfer the two criminals and the entire case to the Special Criminal Court for strict punishment in the next few days.</p>
<p>Xuan Tie-wu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, said when he met with a reporter from the Central News Agency on the afternoon of the 14th: The communist army's attempt to land has been crushed by the National Army, but their spying on the Songhu defense area is still worthy of attention. The garrisons in various places, together with the local teams, are on standby at any time. If the bandits take any further action, they will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th] The communist bandits who attempted to land in Nanhui were unable to withstand the attack of the defending troops, and after going into the sea, they fled southeast to the coast of Dinghai, Zhejiang, with the intention of landing on Daishan Island. The provincial security authorities had previously ordered the Hangzhou Bay and coastal troops to take strict precautions.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhang Shi, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau and Director of the Special Criminal Division, and Liu Fang-hsiung, Director of the Investigation Division of the Municipal Government, based on the results of secret investigations over the past few days, launched a surprise action yesterday to search for and arrest illegal profiteers who were engaged in foreign exchange racketeering and black market gold and banknotes. As of midnight, considerable and surprising gains had been made. According to our reporter, the scale of the private foreign exchange racketeering and the huge amount of inflows and outflows were even greater than that of the previously busted Lin Wang Company. As for the black market gold and banknotes, less was seized. More than ten suspects have been arrested in the above two parts and have been detained after preliminary interrogation yesterday. It is reported that the more famous ones are Shen, Zhou, and Lü, and the background involves a certain wealthy person. Details are expected to be officially announced today.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Conspiracy to Incite Labor Unrest in Wuxi Fails: Communist Labor Movement Leader Arrested: Confesses to Continuously Inciting Three Trends of Labor, Academic, and Dance Unrest: Escorted to Shanghai Yesterday and Will Be Sent to the Special Criminal Court for Trial <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has recently cracked a communist underground labor movement organization case in Beijing and Shanghai, and the leader has been arrested. According to the suspect's confession to the Police Department, the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory labor unrest, the Tongji University academic unrest, and the dance unrest that shook the city were all incited by the same group.</p>
<p>Recently, the Police Department received a report that the Communist Beijing-Shanghai Line Labor Movement Group planned to instigate a labor unrest in the Shin Hsin Factory in Wuxi, and the leader of the bandits planned to go to Wuxi from Shanghai to command. After Wang Chao-huai, Director of the Section, learned of this, he immediately ordered Liu Yao, the head of the Wuxi-Shanghai Section under his jurisdiction, to take strict precautions. On the morning of the 7th of this month, the cadres of the Wuxi-Shanghai Section captured bandit leader Zhu Sung-mao at Wuxi Station. After several strict inquiries, he finally confessed that he was one of the persons in charge of the labor movement on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. The bandit also confessed that the communist labor movement organization on the Beijing-Shanghai Line had more than 800 people, including more than 100 in Shanghai. The group leader was Li Cheng-kuang. The famous Shin Hsin blood case in Shanghai, the Tongji academic unrest case, and the dance girl smashing the Social Bureau case were all instigated by the main cadres of the unit. In April of this year, the group was ordered to instigate labor unrest at the Shin Hsin No. 3 Factory in Wuxi, but the matter was exposed and failed. This time, he was ordered to be responsible for the deployment, so he went to Wuxi from Shanghai at the beginning of the month, lived in a small inn next to the Shin Hsin No. 3 Factory for several nights, and had secretly completed the arrangement of the labor unrest clues with the communists lurking in the factory, and planned to launch it in the middle of the month. The bandit also confessed that the communist labor movement personnel used various identities such as shops, cigarette shops, factories, and agencies as cover to engage in academic unrest, labor unrest, and dance girl movements. His wife, Xu, is a senator of a county along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and also confessed that the head of a county government department and a factory technician are both communist cadres. Director Wang of the Police Department attached great importance to the county and specially ordered him to be escorted to Shanghai. Yesterday, under the strict escort of the railway police, he was escorted to Shanghai, and Director Wang personally interrogated him along with Section Chief Liu. When the bandit confessed yesterday, he confessed in detail the various conspiracies of the communists, and recounted his experience of joining the bandits and writing a confession. The bandit will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation within a few days.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Understanding Fire Protection Plans: When Will They Be Realized? Residents Constantly Feel Fear for Their Safety; Insufficient Funds Hinder Equipment Expansion <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] It is said that there was once an official who conducted many fire prevention inspections. During these inspections, he often heard residents grumbling: "What danger is there in this chimney? It's perfectly fine. It's been installed here for forty or fifty years, and it has never caused a fire!" He immediately replied with profound experience: "Sir, just because a fire hasn't occurred in forty or fifty years doesn't guarantee that there will never be any danger!" Later, eight out of ten of them, forgetting this warning, experienced terrible fires in their homes.</p>
<p>The fact that a fire hasn't broken out in forty or fifty years is no guarantee against the sudden arrival of tragedy. Shanghai residents understand this principle, but they can't seem to remember it. Violations of building codes, storage of flammable materials, and many who, after a hard day's work, extinguish a cigarette butt before going to sleep. Fires finally break out suddenly when they least expect it.</p>
<p>Pacific Fire Hydrants Often Malfunction</p>
<p>Once a fire breaks out, the affected party, facing raging flames, naturally tries to salvage the destruction of their life's work. They call the fire department! The telephone in the fire department's control room is located in the busiest commercial district. The ring goes unanswered for a long time. By the time the fire truck arrives with its alarm blaring, the narrow streets are congested with vehicles, so the arrival time is not ideal. And when the hoses are connected, the fire hydrants often malfunction. Last year, during the large fire at the Southeast Rubber Shoe Factory on Changyang Road, the fire truck rushed to the scene, but the first hydrant nearby had a damaged axle. They switched to another, but it was filled with rocks. They switched again and found it was still blocked with rocks. Finally, they found a working hydrant three blocks away, extending the hose by 1,300 feet. The time wasted was several minutes, and the fire spread to over a dozen neighboring homes. Wise parents! According to the investigation afterward, these rocks and axles were all damaged by children! Fire inspectors cannot prevent these man-made tragedies!</p>
<p>A Kind of Blow, a Kind of Insult</p>
<p>The anxiety of those affected by the fire often leads to some abnormal behavior. If the fire truck arrives late or the water connection is slow, complaints arise, which is a blow to the firefighters. Last year, when a fire broke out at the Zhongnan Can Factory on Xin Jian Road, the fire truck arrived after the flames were extinguished, and only white smoke was rising from the roof. However, the factory firmly refused to allow firefighters to climb up and extinguish the remaining embers. This is an insult to the work of the firefighters. Another example is the large fire on Fangbang Road in Nanshi last year. After the fire truck arrived, the water supply suddenly cut off. They had to find a way to get water from outside the Nanyang Bridge. How could the raging flames wait for the long journey from the Bund to the New World? The result was the ruin of nearly a hundred households. This is the public utilities playing a joke on the fire department.</p>
<p>Under the temptation of "Help me, I understand!", corrupt firefighters have been successively eliminated over the past two years. Under the threat of "Criticism for gossip when entering a fire scene, blame for negligence when not entering," many good firefighters have resigned. Now, on this land with a population density of five million, the total number of firefighters is only four hundred and fifty-eight. There is a reason why we constantly feel fear for our safety! There is also a reason for the loss of over 150 billion in the eighty-four fires last month!</p>
<p>Replenishment is by no means something that can be done immediately.</p>
<p>Ultimately: insufficient funding and limited staffing prevent the fire department from expanding. Shanghai is a large metropolis with 780,000 mu of land, but there are only 329 fire hydrants. Fifty-three fire trucks are outdated, still legacies from the concession era. There are even fewer fire stations, less than one-third of the 29 police precincts. According to expert estimates, to balance the fire risk of Shanghai's vast area and population, the fire equipment should be expanded to at least: 43 fire stations, 13,658 fire hydrants, and 280 fire trucks. Then, any fire can be reached and water can be deployed within five minutes, but when will this "ideal safety plan" be realized?</p>
<p>There is also the problem of "people." With the current total number of firefighters, they cannot rest for 24 hours, which naturally has a significant impact on work efficiency. But it takes at least five years to train a firefighter from start to finish. Replenishment is by no means something that can be done immediately. Driver Sergeant Yu Changgen died in the line of duty last week. Another firefighter technician is lost. The authorities' deep mourning at the memorial service is enough to make people think deeply!</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Garrison Headquarters has not yet received instructions from the Ministry of National Defense regarding the identity of Liu Deming, president of the Friends of the Military Society, so the trial, which has been brewing for many days, has not yet officially started. Liu is still detained in the Guardhouse of the Garrison Headquarters' Military Law Department. Family members are allowed to visit every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It is said that his living conditions are still good. Rumors that Liu's wife, Weng Huihua, went to Nanjing, etc., have been denied by her. Weng has now entrusted this case to lawyer Chuan Kuanglin to handle it in full. He will submit a plea on behalf of Liu Deming regarding his personal matters to the Garrison Headquarters within the next few days, requesting bail. If there are incriminating charges, he also intends to ask the Garrison Headquarters to transfer Liu to the District Court for trial. As for the Friends of the Military Society, the society will come forward today to file a request with the Ministry of National Defense and the Garrison Headquarters to unseal the society and allow it to resume operations. At the same time, Attorney Fu will publish a statement in the newspaper today on behalf of the society to explain the case. He believes that Liu is a natural person, and the Friends of the Military Society is a legal person. Whether Liu committed a crime or not involves criminal matters. As for the Friends of the Military Society, its organization is whether it is legal and whether its business hinders society, which is a matter of administrative punishment. The two are not related. It is also learned that Tang Enbo, the chairman of the society, has not yet learned the details of the case. The directors of the society are planning to find a way to report it.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association recently believed that the draft of the temporary property tax under discussion by the Legislative Yuan was not in line with the national conditions, and that rash implementation would only widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Therefore, it telegraphed the Legislative Yuan, detailing the reasons. The original text reads: "Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing, and Vice President Chen Jun: Recent reports state that Legislative Yuan members Liu Butong and others have proposed to the Yuan to request the government to immediately levy a temporary property tax to equalize wealth and save the country from peril. Reading the draft regulations, the target of taxation covers all individuals, legal persons, domestic and foreign, and the means of collection include in-kind payment. The tax rate is progressively progressive from 5% to 60%, and a 30% reward is used to entice whistleblowers. According to various sources, the head of finance has already made plans to use this to show off his financial skills, and the highest legislative body of the Constitution is also cooperating with the government to help the government's painstaking plans with a lightning-fast proposition. Since the announcement of the tax regulations, the whole country has been shocked. It is believed that the so-called equalization of wealth and saving the country from peril in the title of the regulations is not in line with the national conditions, and rash implementation will only widen the gap between the rich and the poor, and the national economy and people's livelihood will be in greater peril. The key to this is dared to be painfully stated to your Yuan. It is said that the equalization of wealth is a common facility for modern countries to eliminate social crises. The so-called wealthy people must first truly recognize them and cannot graft them to treat those who are engaged in production and have production tools as wealthy, resulting in a difference of millimeters and thousands of miles. In recent years, a small number of people have relied on special privileges and used opportunities to accumulate their wealth without restriction. It is sincerely hoped that the country will adhere to the utmost fairness, reverse its surplus to benefit the national treasury, so that the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies will be reduced, and the issuance of currency will also be limited. The national strength is cultivated, and the feelings of the people are comforted. It is a pity that these few people have already transferred their financial resources overseas and spent their leisurely years under the protection of the private property system in friendly countries. Due to the international environment and domestic situation, the country is unable to investigate and unable to sanction. In desperation, the special property tax has been changed again and again into a special relief tax, and it has ended up being evaded by the gate, losing its focus. Although it is held in various places, the effect is not obvious. The country is already in trouble, so it can only ignore everything and abandon its original intention. Occasionally, the implementation of property tax is discussed, and those who have not been able to clear the wealthy turn more targets to the whole people. It is important to know that our country has been in chaos for years. Except for a few powerful and wealthy people, the people of society have been impoverished to the point of starvation. The so-called well-off families have hundreds of millions of dollars due to the endless inflation in recent years. If they are considered rich, in addition to the house tax and rental income tax, they will be forced to sell their property to pay taxes, forcing the common people to not be able to live in peace. Even in terms of industry, there may be storage of products and the existence of production tools, but they can only be used to turn the millstone, barely enabling the production business to not be interrupted, and for the purpose of national profit-making business income tax and business tax, and to prevent the general workers from losing their jobs. If they are taken away to dedicate to the country, the entire production business will collapse, four people will lose their jobs, and they will become extremely poor, which will lead to a situation of disintegration. Who will enjoy the benefits? It is not difficult to imagine. Looking back at history, after the country has just passed through a great disaster, it will always first recuperate and rehabilitate, so that farmers can be safe in the fields and workers can be safe in the shops. I have never heard of depriving them of their production tools, borrowing from the national treasury to say that it is enough to lay the foundation of the country and to stabilize the hearts of the people. Throughout the dynasties, gatherings have always suffered the disaster of collapse. The reason why so many people were displaced in the communist clearings was that the five people were more than satisfied with their jobs. Hearing this measure, although people's hearts are disturbed, they can only wait quietly for the command. However, when the entire economy goes bankrupt, it will inevitably lead to the disaster of political collapse. The precedents recorded in history are obvious. I am deeply concerned that a single mistake will not help the country, and will instead create unforeseen consequences. What I am worried about is that I dare not keep silent. I dare to ask the presidents and all the participants in the discussion to be careful about this temporary property tax case and not to easily pass it in order to save the hearts of the people who are about to fall and to preserve the lifeline of the constitutional republic. The Shanghai Industrial Association Preparatory Committee sincerely telegraphed, hoping to be observed, cold."</p>

<p>The rice market saw an unprecedented surge yesterday, affected by the price increases in Xishi, coupled with the fact that the prices of all goods outside the industry continued to climb to new heights, and people's confidence was strong. Although economic commissioners went to the market to monitor transactions, people's confidence remained strong and did not decrease slightly. The opening price in the early market was astonishing. Extra high japonica rice was once quoted at 10.5 million, and white japonica rice also broke the 10 million mark, but there were few transactions. In the afternoon, the official trading price for white japonica rice and thin indica rice was 9.9 million, but it was not high-quality rice. Sheep indica rice and white yuan rice both reached 9.9 million, each rising by about 1 million. The prices of rice in the Nanshi market also increased by 1 million.</p>
<p>The rise in flour was very dramatic. Due to the soaring rice prices and the rising prices of all goods, people's confidence was even stronger. In addition, the China Trust Bureau suddenly stopped selling it yesterday, and the rise was like a tiger with wings. In the market, only the second-grade Shou Tao flour opened at 2.05 million. The opening price for Bingchuan flour outside the market was 3.1 million, and later rose to 3.2 million. Lao Che flour was 3.25 million, each rising sharply by 400,000 to 500,000. Large bags of bran were traded at 2.83 million yesterday, and new wheat was 4.4 million.</p>
<p>Coarse grains saw another sharp rise, creating endless new high prices every day. Under the skyrocketing rice prices yesterday, they saw even more frantic progress. The cargo owners' minds were firm, almost unwilling to sell. Hankou Zha beans closed at 5.5 million, a sharp increase of 700,000. The initial rise in corn was still slight, but the market became more severe later. Qidong corn closed at 6.2 million, a sharp increase of 700,000 to 800,000. High-quality mung beans rose by more than 1 million, and red sorghum rose by 400,000 to 500,000. New silkworms and new yuan wheat were frequented by customer gangs, rising by 400,000 to 500,000 and 600,000 to 700,000. Tianjin sesame was taken by the gang, soaring by 2.5 million, and raw peanuts rose by 2 million.</p>
<p>The rise in edible oil was pervasive. The market was very active. People's confidence was stronger and stronger under the rise of various goods. Soybean oil rose by 1.6 million, and Da You soybean oil was 22.7 million. Rapeseed oil was 21.5 million, and raw oil rose sharply by 2.3 million. Jiangbei and Ji barrel raw oil directly broke the 30 million mark. Small-cart sesame oil also reached 30 million, a rise of 4 million, the largest increase. Soybean cake was taken by the Shan gang, rising by 260,000 to 270,000.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Intensified Extra-Market Stimulation Leads to Stronger Rebound in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially weakened due to the anticipation of a high-ranking official's visit to Shanghai, prompting law-abiding investors to exercise caution. However, after 3:00 PM, a rebound began, driven by the black market outside the exchange, leading to a surge that resulted in high closing prices.</p>
<p>The market opened steadily in the morning due to the previous week's after-hours activity in the black market. Yong Yarn opened at 3790 yuan. Market participants were quite intimidated by the high-ranking official's visit, causing the price to retreat to a low of 3735 yuan. The extra-market activity was profitable, with ample buying interest at lower prices. Brokerage fees opened at the original price, and despite rising in the middle of the day, it struggled around 3800 yuan. Ultimately, due to the sharp rise in yarn and cloth, a new high of 3855 yuan was seen after 11:00 AM. However, small and miscellaneous stocks, except for Rongfeng, were exceptionally weak, with the noon close at 3745 yuan. Compared to the previous Saturday, Xinhua and Huafeng fell by half a percent, Zhongxing, Xinyi, and Zhabei remained flat, while other stocks showed mixed gains and losses.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yong Yarn opened at 3790 yuan and fell to a low of 3745 yuan, after which it gradually recovered. National banks showed little change, but further encouragement from the black market led to a new high of 3915 yuan at the close. Other stocks also rose sharply. Compared to the morning close, Jinglun and Huafeng rose by 10%, Yong Yarn, Xinyi, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, Tongyi, Rongfeng, and Xinhua rose by half a percent, Hengfeng, Yonggong, and Shangwu remained flat, and the rest rose slightly. Unlisted stocks outside the exchange rose slightly, up to a strong half a percent, with Cultural Bank and Dasheng remaining popular.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday showed weakness. Unified C opened at 480,000 yuan and fell to a low of 440,000 yuan before leveling off slightly. Trading volume was only 3 million yuan. Compared to the previous Saturday, A, B, and C fell by 40,000 yuan each, Unified D fell by 50,000 yuan, and Type E fell by a little over 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: Yesterday's gains remained sharp. Ewo Yarn opened at 6.15 million yuan and rose steadily to close at 6.35 million yuan. The middle of the day was volatile, with repeated highs and retreats. Guangbang (Guangdong) foreign firms were buyers, while money exchangers and small investors were mostly sellers. As a result, compared to the previous Saturday, Ewo Yarn, British-American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, Yue Guang, Ewo Brewery, and Aviation Industries rose by half a percent each, while Paperboard and Steel Industries rose by 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Abundant Foreign Remittances Fail to Tighten Credit <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Despite the authorities selling large quantities of goods in recent days, the influx of remittances from North China to Shanghai has made it difficult to tighten credit. On Saturday, the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee sold over 1.2 trillion yuan of yarn and cloth. This large sum was deposited with the Central Bank yesterday. However, due to the large remittances from other cities and the abundance of banker's acceptances, the net clearance of bank drafts decreased to 575 billion yuan. Individually, the Central Bank gained 708.1 billion yuan, the Bank of China lost 372.3 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications lost 122 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank lost 37.9 billion yuan, the Central Trust of China gained 227.3 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau lost 33.4 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury gained 115.2 billion yuan. The large clearinghouse gained 159.2 billion yuan, the small clearinghouse lost 1.007 trillion yuan, and foreign banks gained 272.8 billion yuan.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Central Bank authorities, in an effort to tighten credit, have repeatedly convened meetings of senior bank officials, led by Vice President Liu Gongyun, to exchange views and review countermeasures. It is said that the authorities plan to strengthen controls on the financial sector.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a continuous influx of speculative capital into Shanghai, leading to an increasingly loose money supply. Procurement from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions remained strong, and buying from inside and outside the industry was also vigorous. Although spinning mills had begun selling, strong buying interest pushed the initial price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn to 500 million yuan. Subsequently, as scattered sellers rushed to cover their positions, buyers were willing to pay high prices, driving the market price up again to close at 524 million yuan, up 39 million yuan from the weekend. Prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by about 10%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw surging yarn prices and a loose money supply. Procurement from Hankou, Shanxi, and the northern regions remained healthy, and dyeing factories also increased their purchases of grey cloth. The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 350,000 yuan. Subsequently, as buyers from Tianjin rushed to purchase, the market rose sharply, reaching an unprecedented high of 10.05 million yuan before closing at 10.04 million yuan, a surge of 850,000 yuan from the previous weekend. Four Gentlemen serge was very popular due to purchases from Hankou and the northern regions, rising by a substantial 1.156 million yuan.

<p>[Yixing, May 8th Dispatch] Since the opening of the spring cocoon market in Yixing, Liyang, Wuxi, and Changzhou, cocoon prices have been rising steadily (Yixing cocoon prices have reached 35 million yuan), and cocoon farmers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. In the Wuxi and Changzhou areas, most have already dried their fresh cocoons themselves, waiting for a higher price. Therefore, procurement by various businesses has not been enthusiastic recently, and it is expected that this year's cocoon procurement results will be difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The responsible persons of the Shanghai Designated Banks Association held a meeting last Friday and made the following important decisions: (1) Member banks may charge importers and exporters a handling fee of 1.25% of the total exchange value for US dollar transactions. The total exchange value refers to the sum of the official exchange rate and the market price of exchange certificates. This handling fee is provisionally set at 13,000 yuan (assuming a market price of 550,000 yuan), but may be adjusted as necessary, and the brokers will be notified by the Designated Banks Association. The handling fees for other foreign currencies will be calculated based on the US dollar standard, and the conversion rate will be handled according to Central Bank Circular No. 138. No handling fee will be charged if the exchange certificate is handled by the same bank. (2) Section 2 of Article 5 of the Designated Banks Association's constitution should be amended to read: "When a member bank handles and acts as an agent for foreign exchange business, and its exchange must be transferred through another bank, in addition to deducting the handling fee as usual, another 0.5 per thousand of the 'total exchange value' should be deducted to compensate for business losses." (3) The handling fee unit prices listed in Article 7 of the constitution are as follows: 3,000 yuan (legal tender, same below) for US dollars, 6,000 yuan for British pounds, 1,000 yuan for Philippine pesos, 1,000 yuan for Thai baht, 1,000 yuan for Malayan dollars, 1,000 yuan for Dutch guilders, 1,000 yuan for Swiss francs, 500 yuan for rupees, 500 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, and 1,000 yuan for legal tender (per 100 legal francs). (4) If a customer requests separate exchange certificates, the Huichang Bank should charge a handling fee equivalent to one US dollar for each newly issued certificate, based on its total exchange value.</p>

<p>Hoping Jiaotong University Will Still Be Under the Ministry of Transportation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] There are a total of 800 graduates from Jiaotong University this year, and the future of 70-80% of them has not yet been resolved. According to President Cheng Xiaogang's conversation with reporters: The school had previously sent letters to the Resources Commission and other relevant parties to contact them, but many were rejected. Those who sent letters of recruitment were mostly transportation agencies in remote provinces. To date, only a small number of the 800 people have found a way out, and he is extremely anxious about this serious problem. Currently, the deans of various departments are doing their best to find a way to introduce employment opportunities for the graduating students.</p>
<p>President Cheng also said: The Ministry of Education currently allocates 400 million yuan per month for the school's operating expenses. This amount is only enough to cover the increase in water and electricity prices this month, and usual expenses are mostly maintained by loans or subsidies. He hopes that the school can restore the system before 1937 and be under the Ministry of Transportation, so that the school's finances and the employment of graduates can be facilitated much more</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A dispute occurred in the Mayor's Cup football final the day before yesterday. The incident involved Tung Wah player Han Nibo punching and slapping referee Jiang Yinseng. The Football Association issued a statement yesterday claiming that Tung Wah had voluntarily forfeited its rights in the match, but Tung Wah claimed it would file a protest, leading to conflicting accounts. According to Mr. Mai Youliang, the team's protest letter has been delivered to the Football Association, and its content and reasons are the same as the letter sent to the newspapers. Jia had personally asked Shen Huichun whether the continued game would be considered official, to which Shen nodded in agreement, if Tung Wah had already forfeited, why the continue the game? But today, Shen Huichun denied that he had said the continued game was official. According to Shen Peiji of the Football Association, the game was continued entirely due to the situation with shares at the time, otherwise thousands of spectators would have demanded refunds, which would have been terrible. Then why was this situation not told to the Tung Wah players? Which gives the appearance of deception. Shen Peiji said: Tung Wah's forfeiture was based on the report of referee Jiang Yinseng. Jiang ordered Han Nibo to leave the field and continue the game, but Tung Wah refused to obey, and captain Li Yao told Jiang Yinseng that they were willing to forfeit. Who is right and who is wrong is unclear. It is said that the Football Association and the Referees Association will both hold meetings, and Jiang Yinseng intends to file a lawsuit against Han Nibo. Everything remains to be developed.</p>

<p>Before going to Nanyang for inspection, Hao Gengsheng, Secretary-General of the National Sports Federation, personally asked Zhao Minheng, Chairman of the Tennis Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association, to organize a national tennis organization to promote tennis throughout the country and to establish contact with the international tennis community. This matter can be formally prepared after Mr. Hao returns. Mr. Zhao, in view of this, plans to first prepare a basic court in preparation for initiating competitions and promoting other tennis activities in the future, and it can also serve as a clubhouse for the national tennis organization. It has been found land in a certain place in Shanghai West, enough to build an ideal club. Yesterday noon, tennis enthusiasts were specially invited to hold the first initiators' meeting. The result was quite satisfactory. The second initiators' meeting will be held at noon this Thursday. The current priority is to build a court. The construction plan has been roughly drafted. The land area is 185 feet long from east to west and 174 feet wide from north to south. Three doubles courts, one singles court, a clubhouse of 30 feet wide, 20 feet deep and one building will be constructed. It is divided into dressing rooms, shower rooms, storage rooms, meeting rooms, and offices. One grandstand will be built first, 100 feet long and eight levels high, and eight small grandstands, each 12 feet long and three levels high, will be built separately. Normally, they will be placed on the Valley Field, and when competing, they will be concentrated on one side, with a total of 1,000 seats. The general height of the bamboo fence, and all the necessary equipment, etc., is estimated to cost 6 billion yuan according to current estimates. It was decided at the first meeting yesterday to divide into 40 shares, with each unit recognizing at least two shares. The number of basic members is based on 20 people. After the second meeting on Thursday, construction can begin, and it is expected to be completed at the end of July. All public competitions this year can be held at the court.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Explanation of Lao Tzu's "Not Exalting the Worthy" Chapter <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>"Not exalting the worthy, causes the people not to contend; not valuing goods that are hard to obtain, causes the people not to steal; not displaying the desirable, causes the people's hearts not to be disturbed. Therefore the sage governs by: emptying their minds, filling their bellies, weakening their wills, and strengthening their bones—constantly causing the people to be without knowledge or desire, so that those who are wise dare not act. Practicing non-action, then nothing is ungoverned."</p>
<p>If the ruler esteems worthies and establishes standards and limits to promote them, then people will compete with each other to seek advancement, and thus there will be contention. Moreover, if people compete for advancement, they will resort to embellishment, deception, and fraud, so those promoted may not be truly worthy to assist the ruler. There are few who do not disrupt the government. Furthermore, the governance of exalting the worthy is a governance of people; when people exist, governance arises; when people are gone, governance ceases. This is not a way to be sustained. How does it compare to governing by naturalness, allowing the people to develop their talents and abilities and seek their own happiness? The ruler's job is to guide the people's talents and abilities beneficially, seeking natural progress without forcing anything. Progress is the people's own progress, governance is the people's own governance, and the people themselves manage their own progress and governance. Such progress and governance can be sustained and will not have dramatic changes of rise and fall. The so-called democratic governance of today, is it not in this? Goods that are hard to obtain are the so-called "rare objects" (see Chapter 57). It is not only rare objects that are not valued; rare talents are also not esteemed. Valuing rare objects causes people to compete for them to profit, and a thieving heart arises; esteeming rare talents causes people to compete to adorn themselves to gain promotion. Adorning oneself to gain promotion is already a form of thievery. "The desirable" are rare objects and unusual talents. If the ruler does not favor and esteem the unusual, then the people will not compete to obtain and adorn themselves. Therefore, it is said: "Not displaying the desirable, causes the people's hearts not to be disturbed." "Emptying their minds" means that the mind is not attached to things; only by not employing cleverness to pursue things can the mind not be attached to things. "And not valuing goods that are hard to obtain" and "not displaying the desirable" are also ways to cause wisdom to be restrained inward and not pursue external things. "Emptying their minds" is to receive the Dao; the Dao is not attached to things but embraces and accommodates everything. If the mind can receive the Dao, taking the Dao as its essence, then its manifestations in dealing with people and things will also be like the Dao's embracing and accommodating, without contention with others and without conflict with things. "Filling their bellies" means having enough clothing and food. The common people take clothing and food as their foundation. When clothing and food are sufficient, and they are free from the burdens of physical needs, then they can advance in the Dao—this is why the desire to "empty the people's minds" must begin with "filling their bellies." However, if the people can prepare their minds to receive the Dao, then the mind has a master, and desires do not grow, not pursuing things and initiating contention, robbery, and slaughter. Thus, heaven and earth have abundant wealth, and everyone's livelihood is sufficient, and the belly is further filled; moreover, when the mind receives the Dao, then it is compatible with others, without any sense of self and other. The wealth of heaven and earth is used to nourish each other, the affairs of livelihood are equitable, and governance can be expected to progress—this is advancing the people in the Dao, which in turn enables the people's livelihood to be sufficient and equitable and governance to progress. "Will" is where the heart is directed; the use of the Dao is supremely gentle; if where the heart is directed is in the Dao, then the will is "weak." This so-called "weakness" is what is meant by "concentrating your qi to achieve softness" (see Chapter 10)—"concentrating your qi" means focusing your emotions ("qi" means emotion, the power of life) on the Dao; "achieving softness" means achieving the ultimate use of non-action and non-contention (non-action and non-contention enable harmony and mutual assistance with people and things). "Bones" are a metaphor for the body; if one upholds the Dao without changing, then the body is firm and strong. "Will" refers to use; the essence of the Dao is supremely healthy, and its use is extremely gentle, thus achieving the effect of embracing all things without omission and circulating without danger. If people can uphold the Dao for use, then in dealing with people and things, they will be compatible and mutually supportive. The sage governs by causing the people's minds to be empty, their bellies to be full, their wills to be weak, and their bones to be strong. Ultimately, this is to make the people "without knowledge or desire" (the so-called "not to enlighten the people, but to make them ignorant" is the meaning here). What is known and desired are to adorn talents for advancement, rare goods for profit. When the people's minds are empty, their bellies are full, their wills are weak, and their bones are strong, then power, profit, fame, and position are not what they admire or pursue. Even the wise dare not play tricks to court failure. Therefore, it is said: "So that those who are wise dare not act." "Practicing non-action" summarizes what was said above: "Not exalting the worthy" is non-action in employing people; "not valuing goods that are hard to obtain" is non-action in managing wealth; "not displaying the desirable" is non-action in fame, profit, power, and position; "emptying their minds" is receiving the Dao with non-action; "filling their bellies" is providing for the nourishment of the physical body with non-action; "weakening their wills" is emulating the use of the Dao with non-action; "strengthening their bones" is upholding the essence of the Dao with non-action. Exhausting the use of non-action causes the people to be without knowledge or desire, and even the wise dare not act. Then the world is governed—non-action is the supreme action in the world. Acting through non-action and governing through non-governance are mutually related and connected, the path of the essence of the Dao manifesting its use and circulating.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Idle Thoughts by the Lake (3) <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Ou</p>
<p>Desire</p>
<p>The most real and reliable thing in life should be one's immediate awareness. But this awareness is also the most elusive and difficult to grasp. Purely from the perspective of inner awareness, life is like a great waterfall, changing and vanishing in every instant, never stopping. The present moment appears and vanishes in a flash, impossible to control or freeze. Anyone who tries to focus intently on the present moment will feel this acutely. Your mind is either racing toward the future or clinging to the past. If we call the former hope and the latter memory, it seems that life is equally divided between hope and memory. If you were to destroy all memories, it would be equivalent to erasing your entire life. However, there is also no such thing as a life without any hope for the future. Between these two, there is always some degree of imbalance. Some are dominated by memory, while others are dominated by hope. It is almost impossible to achieve a perfect balance, an equal distribution between the two. Yet, it is precisely this imbalance that creates the vast differences in human lives.</p>
<p>Let us say that there are two types of people in life: those who lean forward (with more hope for the future) and those who lean backward (valuing memories of the past). The most prominent characteristic of the backward-leaning type is a love of history. History is entirely a record of past human lives. Forward-leaning people are impatient with this. They are eager to move forward, eager to venture into the unknown realm of the future. They do not want reality; they want ideals. People who value history build ideals from reality, while those who are eager for the future build ideals to transform reality. Novels and plays often arise from this kind of demand. They often depict an idealized future life. However, the future is ultimately unknowable. If you constantly venture in that direction, you will feel as if there is a force, or perhaps destiny, arranging things outside of you, playing tricks on you, powerful and cold, yet also pitiable. If you believe that the past is entirely gone and does not belong to you, you should also realize how vague, intricate, and changeable the future is. Everything about the future is beyond your control, and it does not belong to you either. As your future unfolds, it will prove that your ideals are becoming less real or are gradually changing and retreating. If you stubbornly cling to your personal hopes and insist on moving forward, it will likely end in tragedy. The highest realm in all novels and plays is always tragedy.</p>
<p>Planting mulberry trees by the Yangtze River is highly precarious. Therefore, forward-leaning people easily turn from novels and plays to religion. Religion and the life of novels are both supported by hope for the future, but they shift the future hope even further back, essentially moving it into another world. God and heaven are fundamentally not of this world. To take this as future hope is to say that there is no longer any hope for this present world. Therefore, religion is also a tragedy, only infinitely delaying the final curtain. The life of religion is still the life of a dramatic novel, embracing future hope and plunging into the unknowable, resolutely refusing to retreat—a passionate expression of the forward-leaning human nature.</p>
<p>The life of history is different. It recalls the past more than it imagines the future. The past is gone, but doesn't your heart retain a piece of its memory? You want to keep these traces, and who can take them away from you? It is the real gain you have from life, which you can forever treasure in your heart, never fading. Life moves forward constantly, but it may not catch up with what it hopes for, and may even move further away from hope. Hope gradually fades, but memory gradually increases and becomes richer. Even if life gains nothing else, there is still memory, which everyone can possess peacefully without effort. It is life's only substantial gift to humanity, and you should cherish it as a family heirloom!</p>
<p>The national character of the Chinese people is generally backward-leaning. Therefore, the development of history surpasses that of literature, and among literature, novels and plays are the least developed. According to Chinese concepts, rushing toward the future is desire, while cherishing the past is emotion. Sacrificing the past to satisfy the future is desire, while sacrificing the future to accommodate the past is emotion. Chinese concepts value emotion over desire. In literature, there is little passionate love toward the future between men and women, but there is much deep emotion for the past. Chinese concepts call this depth, hence the saying that gentle and honest are the teachings of poetry. It is also said that carefully attending to the end and tracing back to the distant past enriches the virtue of the people. It is also said that "one death, one life, reveals the depth of friendship," as long as you do not forget the past. The dead are treated as if they are still alive. This kind of emotion is also extremely passionate and romantic, but it is not literary; it turns into ethics and morality.</p>
<p>Westerners' love focuses on future happiness, while Chinese love focuses on past feelings and righteousness. Westerners entrust the dead to God, while Chinese people preserve them forever in their hearts. They look down on fighting for personal future fate, they advocate accepting fate, so they often cannot break through and create new things, but they are extremely protective and conservative of the old. As long as something is coated with their memory, they always try their best to preserve it, preventing it from becoming blurred, disappearing, or changing color. This is also another kind of strong and powerful life, with all the power used deep within the heart. It is not that they have no hope for the future, but their hope focuses on what they remember. They firmly grasp the past as the basis for their future life. They give their most sincere emotions to the past. As long as you encroach on their memory, they will treat you as their life and never let go. Loyalty! Filial piety! All this comes down to this principle. At first glance, it seems like they are stubbornly clinging to one point, but in reality, they can be content in any situation. Asking them to move forward seems burdensome and difficult, but every step they take forward brings gains, never falling short. They twist the future back toward the past and turn themselves toward others, thus merging life and death, self and others into one. They do not seem to have much longing for their personal future happiness.</p>
<p>Backward-leaning cultures also develop religions, but they are different from the forward-leaning type. The forward-leaning type focuses on hope and prayer, while the backward-leaning type focuses on remembrance and gratitude. Like Chinese literature, Chinese religion values emotion over desire in Chinese concepts. It emphasizes repaying kindness over seeking blessings. The former is dissatisfied with the present and seeks forward, so it feels that there is a God outside, which can also be said to be a destiny or force. This further highlights life, making one feel small and even repulsive. The opposition between God and self develops into the theory of inherent evil. Backward-leaning people express satisfaction with the past and express gratitude, seeking only to do their best. The external God loses importance, and the self's position in life rises, thus developing the theory of inherent goodness. The former's God is transcendent, while the latter's God turns inward. Thus, religion becomes ethical and moral again. Each with its own imbalance, walking its own path, whether burying resentment or envying, is this not the dignity of human nature? Should not everyone dignify their own human nature?</p>
<h3 id="e130">Wang Yangming's Theory of Child Education <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Adapting to children's psychological needs and promoting their spontaneous activities has long become a major trend in modern educational methods. The foundation of this theory lies in the liberation of European cultural thought since the seventeenth century. Rousseau's theory of naturalism in education has had a significant impact on later generations. His book "Emile" advocates respecting children's nature, developing their free thinking, and pioneering new educational theories and methods. The traditional education that harmed human nature was thereby shaken.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Chinese education has adhered to old sayings and inherited old methods, either forcibly injecting and instilling or passively prohibiting and suppressing. Neo-Confucian scholars of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties emerged, taking the cultivation of mind and the seeing of one's nature as the purpose of education. In terms of methods, they emphasized respect to eliminate desires, sincerity, and controlling private desires, focusing on static cultivation and depriving all vitality. In the minds of those solemn and sanctimonious Neo-Confucian scholars, there was no such thing as "developing free thought and will." Only Wang Yangming, a visionary educator who emerged in the mid-Ming Dynasty, pioneered a brand-new path in thought. His research on the mind and nature was more profound and extensive than that of Zhou Dunyi, Cheng Yi, Zhu Xi, and Lu Jiuyuan, and the theories he elaborated on education were even more unprecedented. What is particularly commendable is that Yangming lived between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when traditional Taoist thought enveloped the entire society, yet he alone could blaze his own trail, not bound by old sayings, and put forward new views and spirits of education. Compared to Rousseau, who was born in the seventeenth century, he is even more worthy of our respect. Unfortunately, people only know his philosophy of "unity of knowledge and action" and "extending innate knowledge," and rarely understand his theory of child education.</p>
<p>Wang Yangming's theory of child education is explained in detail in his "Main Points for Teaching Children, Instructions to Teachers Liu Bosong and Others" (see "Instructions for Practical Living"). He said: "Now when teaching children, one should focus on filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. As for the methods of cultivating and nurturing them, it is appropriate to entice them with singing poems to express their aspirations, guide them to practice etiquette to cultivate their dignity, and encourage them to read books to open their minds. Nowadays, people often consider singing poems and practicing etiquette to be irrelevant to current affairs. This is a vulgar and narrow-minded view, insufficient to understand the intention of the ancients in establishing education!" Yangming believes that the purpose of child education is "to enlighten them with the right way" (see the same text), and the principle is "filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame," purely for moral practice. He advocates the "unity of knowledge and action" to strengthen the connection between knowledge and behavior, that is, morality is not only satisfied with "knowing" but must be expressed in actual behavior. By knowing to strengthen one's actions, and from actions to solidify one's knowledge, this is the entire learning process of combining knowledge and action. To achieve this practical goal, one must pay attention to teaching materials. Yangming proposed "singing poems," "practicing etiquette," and "reading books." "Singing poems" is "emotional education." Ancient China highly valued "poetry education," which has a great effect on stimulating will and expressing emotions. The "singing and playing" courses in elementary schools today have the same value. "Practicing etiquette" can be said to be a kind of "attitude education," enabling children to cultivate an appropriate attitude to enhance their ability to adapt to life. "Reading books" belongs to "knowledge education." Knowledge is indeed very important for daily life, but if it is separated from the training of practical life, it will inevitably be biased. Yangming's attention to children's emotions and attitudes is worth remembering.</p>
<p>Yangming was able to deeply understand children's psychology. He went on to say: "Generally speaking, children's nature is to enjoy playing and dislike restraint, like grass and trees that are just sprouting, they thrive when stretched out and wither when suppressed. Now, when teaching children, one must guide them to be motivated and joyful in their hearts. Like timely rain and spring breeze, when applied to grass and trees, everything sprouts and flourishes, naturally growing day by day; if there is ice and frost, then life becomes desolate and withers."

<h3 id="e131">The Third Road <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Guan</p>
<p>For the past twenty or thirty years, we seem to have only two views and approaches to tradition and the status quo: revolution and reaction. Upholding tradition and maintaining the status quo is reaction, while overthrowing tradition and the status quo is revolution. Between revolution and reaction, there seems to be no third road. Not being revolutionary is being reactionary; this is what we often hear. But is there no third road? Britain and the United States are now trying to take this third road. American philosopher R.B. Perry, in his book "Puritanism and Democracy," proposed the so-called third road. He said: "Puritanism and democracy, under these or other names, constitute the main part of the American legacy. The main source of any nation's spiritual cultivation must be its own past, constantly rediscovering and renewing the past. A nation that denies its tradition loses its historical identity and destroys the main source of its spiritual vitality. However, a nation that first reaffirms its tradition can also become stagnant and corrupt. But we do not have to choose between revolution and reaction. We have three roads. This third road is faithful with discrimination and foresight." In other words, Perry's so-called third road is to discriminate against tradition, distinguishing its good or bad elements, as a standard for clearing away or retaining. For tradition, it needs to be modified, but it does not need to be completely overthrown. We cannot be overly new, nor can we be overly old. Any nation must have historical traditions, but any nation must also modify its traditions. Moving forward is moving forward on the basis of tradition, not moving forward away from tradition. The author believes that this is of great value to pay attention to.</p>

<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Preface to the New Chronicles of Zunyi</p>
<p>The Institute of History and Geography of National Zhejiang University was established in August of the 28th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the school site was in Yishan, Guangxi. Then Guinan sued, and Suiyu returned to Yiyi in the north. After that, the environment was relatively stable, and the research work made orderly progress. The institute is divided into four groups according to the nature of the discipline, the History Group, the Geomorphology Group, the Meteorology Group, and the Human Geography Group. Recruit graduate students every year. In the 35th autumn, the university began to move back to Hangzhou, leaving Zunyi for seven years. During this period, the tutors and graduate students of the research institute devoted themselves to the field investigation of the Yiyi, and made detailed research on geology, topography, climate, soil, population, settlement, land use, industry, transportation, ethnicity, historical sites and other items. Recording is gratifying, now it is compiled into a book, named "Yi New Chronicles", a total of eleven chapters, seventeen million words, attached with twenty-two maps. Professor Ye Liangfu guided the research and axe-corrected the manuscript, and used a lot of force. Mr. Chen Shupeng's research on the relative height of Zunyi is still the first work in my country. The soil chapter was written by Mr. Ma Rongzhi of the Central Geological Survey in the summer of the 35th year, I would like to express my gratitude. Professor Tan Qixiang's Kao of Yang Bao of Bozhou elaborates on the origins of the Yang Bao clan and the beginning and end of the founding of the country during the 830 years from the late Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, and the old certificate is precise, which is an important document. This is not reproduced here. In addition, there are 40 other papers, which are stored in the institute. Due to space limitations, they have not been published one by one. Now the catalogue is attached at the end of this book.</p>
<p>The Zunyi Prefecture Chronicle was completed in the 21st year of Daoguang, and was compiled by Zheng Zhen and Mo Youzhi. It has 48 volumes, which is known as refined and thorough. Yang Enuan and Zhao Kai compiled the township events from the 22nd year of Daoguang to the 3rd year of Xuantong as the continuation of the Zunyi Prefecture Chronicle, which was completed in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Yiyi has this book of inquiry and preparation, which is enough to add color to the local area. The past chronicles of Shun China are intended to preserve the documents of Sangzi, so their records focus on local historical materials. Most of the new chronicles of Zunyi compiled by the Institute this time are geographical works, with special emphasis on the expression of maps. They are different from the old chronicles in style and are sufficient to fill in the gaps. The most important thing is to improve the people's livelihood. For example, the land use chapter uses the one-fifty-thousandth topographic map published by the Land Survey Bureau in the 29th year of the Republic of China as a powder book. According to the actual survey data, all the distribution of arable land, forests, wasteland, roads, and houses is filled in on the hill, explained, and suggestions are made. This investigation was led by Professor Ren Mei'e, and Chen Shupeng, Zhao Songqiao, Shi Yafeng, and Yang Lipu jointly served as its affairs. From September 24th to October 27th of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the period was one month, and the cost was 8,000 yuan. At that time, the institute's funding was only enough for daily applications, and the ideological and times society gave financial assistance with the surplus funds, which made it possible to complete this project. The drawing of this kind of land use map is still the first time in my country. If it can be widely promoted in various places, it will benefit the great cause of national construction, which is not shallow. The conclusions about the agricultural improvement of Zunyi in the article are based on the field experience, and the facts are not. Not only can it be used as a guideline for the establishment and killing of the local government in the future, but also draw a cross-sectional picture for our vast rural areas, and I hope that those who speak for agricultural policy in my country will pay attention to it. Professor Liu Zhiyuan discovered the Tuanxi Creek Mine in the 30th year of the Republic of China. The manganese of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant during the war was supplied nearby, which is of great significance to the industrial construction in the southwest in the future and is also a memorable event. (The price of each book is 500,000 yuan. Buyers please write directly to the Institute of History and Geography of National Zhejiang University)</p>

<h3 id="e135">"The Spirit of Fahai" <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>Yesterday, the child came back from watching the "Legend of the White Snake" and asked me, "Why did the monk Fahai have to suppress the White Snake Lady in the tower?"</p>
<p>The child is only in school, and he does not understand the sacredness and greatness of love, but he knows that everything about the White Snake Lady has been personified. Since she has no malice towards Xu Xian, the monk really has no need to oppress her or separate them.</p>
<p>Yes! Why oppress her?</p>
<p>As a monk, if he is a high monk, he should protect all living beings, "equalize enemies and relatives", why bother with meddling, and insist on breaking up a good family, making the White Snake Lady hate her for life?</p>
<p>The creation of this tragedy, today, we can use Freud's psychoanalysis to explain, the motive is a conscious or unconscious jealousy.</p>
<p>However, in the human world, there are many people who specialize in parasitizing on alienation and destruction. They are afraid that other people's families will be harmonious, happy, and consistent, so they specialize in creating rumors and rumors to deceive the parties concerned. For this kind of person, we should not hesitate to give the greatest hatred, expose their base psychology of eating friction meals, and then things in the world will have a solution.</p>
<p>Jinshan Temple was burned down. Unfortunately, what should have been burned down was not Jinshan Temple, but the spirit of Fahai!</p>
<h3 id="e136">How to Collect Photographs and Autographs of World Celebrities <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>In front of a house in Brooklyn, USA, sits a weathered mailbox that constantly receives the most amazing letters from around the world. Through the slot of that mailbox are delivered letters from kings, queens, presidents, bishops, dictators, generals, Nobel Prize winners, as well as celebrities like Gandhi, Churchill, Sinclair, Lindbergh, and Einstein.</p>
<p>Behind this mailbox sits the world's most famous "autograph" collector - Greenaway. He is not satisfied with just a signature, but also requires a photograph that the signatory considers to be their best. As a result, he has collected six thousand photographs and autographs of "history makers."</p>
<p>World celebrities rarely agree to the requests of an autograph collector, let alone attach an autographed photo, but when Greenaway makes a request, they rarely disappoint him.</p>
<p>He discovered that most celebrities have a vulnerable spot that is easy to attack - their hobbies. So, when he learned that Prime Minister Attlee liked woodworking, General Zhukov collected medals, Churchill liked copper drums, and Emperor Showa liked using microscopes, he had a way to proceed. He found out that the famous writer H.G. Wells collected toy soldiers, so he sent him a set of rare toy soldiers - and Wells, in gratitude, immediately sent him an autographed photo.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Windsor ignored his first ten letters, but when he sent her a scrapbook filled with news praising her marriage, his request was granted.</p>
<p>Greenaway wrote to the automobile magnate Ford and the inventor Edison for eleven years before finally getting his wish. When he pointed out to Einstein's secretary that he had written three hundred letters to the scientist requesting an autographed photo, the secretary replied that if Greenaway could donate ten US dollars to the children's milk fund, the photo could be sent. He donated ten dollars, and Einstein's autographed photo arrived.</p>
<p>The greatest feature of the photographs collected by Greenaway is that they reveal the personality and hobbies of each individual. For example, the photo Roosevelt sent him was of Roosevelt and his wife chatting by the fireside. The photo Trotsky sent him was a swimming photo, with the words "Wishing you good health, from Trotsky." Mussolini's was a mountain climbing photo, with the words: "1929 is the year of God, and also the seventh year of the Mussolini century." When Greenaway wrote to Hitler for a photo in 1933, Hitler sent him a photo twice as big as Mussolini's.</p>
<p>Greenaway said, "Never ask someone for a photo when they become headline news. It is best to write a few months later, when they will be happy to accept your request because they see that people have forgotten them and you still remember them. In addition, today's opposition leader may be tomorrow's prime minister, today's senator may be tomorrow's president, so it is a good idea to prepare for the future. Asking for an autographed photo on a celebrity's birthday is unlikely to disappoint you."</p>
<p>Greenaway began collecting autographed photos in 1921. Now, his bank safe contains six thousand photos, including representatives from every nation that signed the Treaty of Versailles, representatives from every nation that accepted Japan's unconditional surrender, the pilots who bombed Japan with the atomic bomb, every Nazi war criminal from Nuremberg, and the last five US presidents.</p>
<p>Only two world celebrities have stumped him, one is the violinist Kreisler, and the other is Marshal Stalin. But he is not discouraged. He said that when he collects the autographed photos of these two people, he will feel that everything is perfect.</p>

<p>Keep this book by your side,</p>

<p>A straight pen elucidates the obscure and reveals the subtle.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Who knows which figures are still vigorous?</p>
<p>As I grow old, my feelings become unbearable.</p>
<p>Don't say that studying books is just wasting paper,</p>
<p>The "A New Account of the World" still maintains a refined discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Fish of My Hometown <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yi Xian</p>
<p>"I'd rather drink the water of Jianye than eat the fish of Wuchang." (A saying from the Three Kingdoms period) The fish of my Chu region have been famous throughout the world for thousands of years. From Huangzhou to Huangshigang, a hundred-li stretch of water, the fish produced are the most numerous and the most delicious. When Su Dongpo first arrived in Huangzhou, he wrote a poem, "The Yangtze River surrounds the city, knowing the fish are delicious; the good bamboo connects to the mountains, feeling the bamboo shoots are fragrant." The "Chibi Rhapsody" has the line "Raise the net and get fish, huge mouths and fine scales, shaped like the perch of Songjiang." Zhang Zhihe's poem "White egrets fly before Xisai Mountain, peach blossoms flow and mandarin fish are fat." (Xisai Mountain is near Huangshigang, also named Daoshang .) These famous lines are enough to add color to the fish of my hometown.</p>
<p>My ancestral home is the Ba River in Qishui County. The Ba River borders the Yangtze, and is located right in the middle of Huangzhou and Huangshigang. In the past, when I returned to my hometown to sweep the tombs, the people of my clan would invite me to dinner, and fish was a necessary dish, either stir-fried fish slices or fish balls (i.e. fish dumplings). The fish slices are made with mandarin fish, because they have fewer bones; the fish balls are made with white fish, which is fresh and tender. White fish are produced in all lakes and rivers, and the large ones can grow to four or five feet long, and are also called Yang . The "Garden of Stories" has the saying "Those who cast their lines with the wrong bait and are welcomed to suck it are Yang." This is the first of my nostalgic hometown flavors.</p>
<p>Across the river from Huangzhou is Xishan Mountain, which contains the Hanxi Temple. When Dongpo was exiled to Huangzhou, he often traveled there by boat. Below Xishan Mountain is Fankou, which is the mouth where the inner lake communicates with the outer river, much like the mouth of the lake that welcomes Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River. The fish produced in the waters where Fankou connects the lake and the river are the best bream, with small heads and wide bellies, called Chatou bream, also known as Zhejia bream. Although the villagers are not good at cooking, the bream is deep-fried in oil and then seasoned with pine branches, which is the most fragrant with wine. The sides of this fish are the most fatty and delicious. The "Book of Songs" says, "How can it be that when eating fish, it must be the carp of the river?" is carp, this is the second of my nostalgic hometown flavors.</p>
<p>Although Yunmeng County in Hubei does not border the river, it has many lakes. The local people use the white fish from the lake, mixed with bean flour, to make fish noodles, which are good both stir-fried and boiled, and even more delicious when stir-fried with crabs. Chen San Yuan wrote a poem, "My left foot wildly discards the sandal, and I'm not willing to eat with others. The home-brewed wine is planted by Tao Gong, and the hometown flavor is allowed to be Xu Po's noodles." There is a small note: "Jiusheng set up Yunmeng fish noodles, and Zuo Sou called it the creation of Shangshu Zhao Chun's mother in the Qianlong period, so it is called Xu Po's noodles." This is a special product of Hubei, the third of my nostalgic hometown flavors.</p>
<p>Before the Republic, when my family lived in Wuchang, we always made preserved fish at the end of the year. Relatives and friends would buy large green fish or carp, from dozens of catties to two or three hundred catties, salt them for a few days and dry them in the sun. They were used to worship gods and ancestors and to entertain guests as New Year's dishes. Those that were not eaten were cut into pieces and soaked in camellia oil. In the summer, they were taken out and steamed, and they tasted like ham, clean and without drawbacks, better than the dried green fish from Hangzhou and Shaoxing. When making preserved fish for the New Year, the roe and liver and white from the belly of the green fish were stir-fried with shredded radish, and everyone could eat as much as they wanted. This is the fourth of my nostalgic hometown flavors.</p>
<p>The Wuchang area has bream, white in color, with a fleshy back, without scales, and the long ones can reach two or three feet. It is best to braise it in soy sauce. The Wumingyuan restaurant in Hankou is most famous for making this. There is also catfish, with a large head and a flat tail, without scales, and a curved and wide mouth, and the large ones can reach more than two feet long. It is steamed with ham, flat bamboo shoots, fragrant mushrooms and oil nets, and has a clear and rich taste. This is the fifth of my nostalgic hometown flavors.</p>
<p>Shanghai has Cantonese cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Fujian cuisine, Shandong and Beiping cuisine, Ningbo cuisine, Suzhou restaurants, and Anhui restaurants, and even Jiu Ru Restaurant and Dewei's Hunan cuisine, but no Hubei cuisine. Friends often discuss this with each other. In fact, there is a special flavor in my hometown, that is, steamed dishes from Mianyang and Tianmen. Chicken, duck, fish, and meat can all be steamed with rice flour. When my relative, Zhou Shenguan, invited guests, one of the dishes was powdered steamed . Its taste is no less than the small cage powdered steamed beef in Jinjiang and other Sichuan restaurants. This is the sixth of my nostalgic hometown flavors.</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, the War of Resistance was followed by banditry, and I have still not been able to return to my hometown to sweep the tombs. I have not tasted the flavors of my hometown for twelve years. I am writing this article to quench my thirst by looking at plums and to fill my hunger with shark cakes.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Child Prodigy of Taiwan, Zeng <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jibai</p>
<p>In the past, Licheng, Shandong, produced a child prodigy named Jiang Xizhang, who annotated the Four Books at the age of nine, causing a sensation for a time. But the later he got, the worse he became, and he eventually became silent and unknown.</p>
<p>Now, Henan has also produced a child prodigy, Zeng Woshi, who has long been a household name in Taiwan, and everyone praises him.</p>
<p>This child prodigy is only five years old this year, and everyone calls him "Five-Year-Old Child Prodigy." He is good at calligraphy and painting, and can wield a brush in public without any difficulty. Last month, on the 20th, the Welfare Association of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation invited Zeng Woshi to perform calligraphy and painting in Huwei, and men, women, and children came to see him in droves. The child prodigy was dressed in shorts, blue socks, and yellow shoes, with a lively and natural demeanor, and seemed to be oblivious to the presence of others. The paper, brushes, ink, and inkstone were prepared in advance. The child prodigy jumped onto the table, sat on the paper, and began to wield his brush, writing the character "Shou" (longevity), and then the character "Hu" (tiger). Its position, stroke power, and structure were all just right, far beyond what an ordinary adult could achieve. How could that little hand have such great wrist strength? It seems that it did not come from practice. The "Hu" character was written in cursive script, and the last stroke was drawn as long as three feet, and he explained that this was "Huwei" (tiger's tail). He also made a painting of orchids for the daughter of a certain section chief in public, and the inscription read: "Orchids are the fragrance of kings," which was chic and stylish, and indeed difficult to achieve. The visitors all marveled at the cleverness of this five-year-old child, and thought it was a "miracle."</p>
<p>Wherever Zeng Woshi goes, his father always follows him to take care of everything. A considerable price must be paid for asking him to do calligraphy and painting. His family's economic situation is said to be very bad, and life is very problematic, but since the child prodigy's fame has become a sensation, many people have given him money, and his life has improved greatly. The government sought to help him study further, and provided him with scholarships. If he can be cultivated properly and fully develop his unique talent, he will surely achieve something in the future. Unfortunately, his father has turned the child prodigy into a capital for making money, taking his child to perform here and there, and making a big business out of it. He charges a certain amount for each performance and another amount for taking pictures, and he has simply become a street performer. I have read in ancient texts that Zhongyong, a villager of Wang Anshi, was extremely intelligent in his childhood, but he was eventually ruined and trampled upon, and he declined and fell. It seems that Zeng Woshi, this lovely little child, is also embarking on this dim road. (Written in Taipei)</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that a Japanese fishing boat was fishing in Chinese territorial waters and was sunk by our warship. It also mentioned the Unzen Maru. This event is very gratifying, and all our people should breathe a sigh of relief. This sigh of relief is not just for this one thing, but because when the Japanese flame was at its peak, they roamed freely on the sea and land of China, as if there was no one else there, and were unreasonably domineering, which made our people feel oppressed, swallow their voices, and endure their anger for a long time. In recent times, in the two years before the July 7th Incident, "smuggling" occurred in various places in the north and south, and their government even called it "special trade." Whenever they were captured by customs or anti-smuggling ships, Japanese and Korean rogues would gather to rob them, so that our country's laws could not be enforced. Their consuls would do their best to protect them, in an阴阳怪气manner, and to the extreme ugly. The losses suffered by Chinese merchants and the national treasury are innumerable. When we read the newspapers, we often saw the faces of violent and rogue-like people. Only because our strength was not equal, our anger was suppressed and could not be vented, and it was not just a matter of one morning or evening. In the distant past, such as in 1908, in the Yue-Nan territorial waters, the Japanese ship Er Chen Maru carried a large amount of smuggled goods, gunpowder, etc., and drove straight into the inner port in violation of the ban. Wu Jingrong, the commander of our Baobi warship, forbade it according to maritime law, boarded the ship for inspection, and, according to the convention, escorted the ship and goods to Humen. Zhang Renjun, the governor of Guangdong, in accordance with the customs joint trial regulations, requested the Japanese consul stationed in Guangdong to conduct a joint trial, but the Japanese consul refused to pay attention, and his envoy made a big noise in the capital to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Qing court was frightened and bowed its head, and ordered the Guangdong governor to immediately release the Japanese ship, compensate for all losses, and punish Chinese officials. All that they demanded was done. This kind of evil and ugly behavior is not only "making power the truth", but also "mixing ghosts and power". Although they gained the upper hand by relying on their power, their international personality was swept away, which is suitable to warn them of being little ghosts. Our commander Wu, as a humble official of a weak country, regardless of the pros and cons, and without avoiding difficulties, executed his duties and completed his mission. Although he suffered unreasonable suppression afterwards, his intelligence and courage were extraordinary, and Chinese and Western people admired him in unison, and he could occupy a page in the glorious national history. Now, the Japanese ships that invaded our seas have been captured; the Japanese criminals have been tried; and their smuggled goods have been confiscated. In the past, even asking their consul to attend the joint trial was not condescended to, but now Chinese officials can try and judge on their own. Where is the overbearing and fierce force of the past now? The net of heaven is vast, and it misses nothing. Is it so! Someone might say that China has openly stated that it will not take a retaliatory attitude towards Japan, and has expressed "leniency". Why are you so indignant? Aren't you being narrow-minded? I say: "Leniency" and "non-retaliation" are the attitudes of the big countries of the authorities, and they have their own inevitable difficulties. In short, the foundation of morality, the relationship between the gaps, and the needs of reality are not just one end, and there is no need to criticize and analyze them here. This time, the Chinese navy's capture of smugglers and punishment of the Japanese was an enforcement of the law, and it was not a retaliation. However, "a person is a breath of air." What I have seen, heard, and recorded in my life, the arrogant and harsh oppression that the Japanese have imposed on China, and the way in which the Chinese people have been oppressed again and again and again for decades, almost suffocating, makes this capture of the boats, the arrest of the smugglers, the trial of the criminals, and the confiscation of the goods a happy thing. Expressing my feelings and making my voice heard is also a matter of not being myself.</p>
