<p>〔本報蚌埠七日電〕蚌宿會戰卽將有重要開展，沿澮　兩河以鉗形陣勢向西北推進之國軍，今日續有進展，頑抗之殘匪六·十三·兩縱隊，已難退阻國軍勁旅雷霆萬鈞之壓力。刻國軍右鉗某部已伸展至固鎭附近，據日前情報，匪主力早離該處，今午盛傳業已克復，軍方未予證實，惟稱，可能於今夜攻克。（按：中央社五日電稱國軍已進入固鎮，當係傳聞之誤。）黃維兵團在强大機羣掩護下，刻復向該部陣地之東南方面出擊，頗爲得手，據來自前綫官員談，黃乒團與向西北追擊兵團前錄之距離極近。又南下兵團西　今仍在臨渙集附近之澮河北岸與匪激戰。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約七日廣播南京訊：據政府方面息：共軍對宿縣西南之國軍發動烈之攻勢，以便突破國軍截擊棧，該報吿並謂國軍第二兵團十萬人在永城吳縣問展開陣勢，準備對共軍發動大規模之殲滅戰。該報吿又稱：共軍十二個縱隊約十萬八千人，企岡突破國軍防棧。據稱·另有國軍正向國軍防綫增援。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕軍息：皖北澮河淝河流域以迄豫皖邊區之戰，對國軍益趨有利，國軍已操勝算。南下國軍三大兵團，在杜聿明將軍指揮下，與越淝河北上之兩大兵團南北合擊，在宿縣固鎭外圍結成鉗形包圍圈，對該地區之陳毅·劉伯承·陳賡之匪部廿個縱隊分進合擊，迄七日止之態勢，國軍以黃維兵團爲核心，堅守雙堆集，緊吸劉伯承匪之一·二·三·四·六·九·十·及陳賡匪之四·九·等九個縱隊於其週邊，經連日陸空協同之痛擊，匪死傷極重·陳毅匪二·四·九·十二·十六·兩廣·渤海等七個縱隊，以宿縣爲中心，掩護陳賡劉伯承兩匪部之北翼，並圖阻撓國軍自西北方南下，夾擊雙堆集外圍。陳毅匪之二·六·十一·十三等四個縱隊，以固鎭以北地區爲中心，掩護劉伯承陳賡兩匪部對雙堆集東南方之攻擊。南下北上國軍，已於外綫分自西北東南對陳·劉·陳·三部完成包圍，三匪部連日東奔西突，皆無成就。我雙堆集之黃維兵團，在空軍掩護下正吸緊劉伯承陳賡匪部，國軍包圍圈芷日益縮小中，此一地區匪二十個縱隊在國軍圍攻中日趨衰弱。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕據接近國務院方面六日談稱：若中國共產黨佔領上海，美國將以全力保護美國商業利益。然該方明白表示，國務院並未作任何保證，美國商人留在該地乃自行冒險，據各方跡象觀之，美領事館官員業已接到訓令，一旦於緊急之時，以其全力保護美人利益。該方指出上海美領事館官員將繼續彼等之職務，與共產黨進入瀋陽時美國領事館仍留任然。彼等稱：美國已公開宣布，美領事館將繼續辦公，並且將以可能之援助畀予美僑，然在目前，硬性及迅速之規定不能予以公佈。消息靈通方面指出，當「非必要」美僑接獲撤退中國之勸吿時，由美僑本身決定「必要」及「非必要」者。蓋「必要」者可准允繼續留駐，此可作爲美領事館官員將全力保護彼等及其利益之解釋。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕監委唐鴻烈·鄧景福·郭仲隗等，於上月底提案糾舉廣東省政府主席宋子文私購飛機，幷令廣東各縣普築機塲跑道，旋經監委張定華·李正樂·曹浩森等審查成立，頃己送達行政院。監院今日發表該糾舉案原文如下：廣東綏靖公署主任兼廣東省政府主席宋子文，爲其出巡轄境及謀偵匪緝私傳達命令之便利，經於本年七月十八日以兼省政府主席身份，通令所屬各縣，尅日分別趕築機塲跑道，並於同年八月間運用外匯，私向美國購買小型民用飛機六架，運粵應用，當時民情怨憤，輿論譁責，而竟悍然不顧，一意孤行，其爲恃權專斷，可以概見。查機之購用與機地之開闢，應屬中央權限，須由中央政府斟酌實際情形與需要，統籌辦理，地方首長無權逕自行使，憲法第一〇七條業經明文規定，該兼主席宋子文，此次私購飛機，擅築機塲跑道，事先旣未報准中央，事後復未呈經主管機關認可，乃竟違法越權，實屬破壞軍政系統，侵越中央職權。至於普築機塲跑道，老其用意，原在便於出巡，衡之情理，究有未當，蓋以一地方主管，出巡轄境，理應深入農村，接近民衆，勤求民隱，卽使不能微服成行，亦宜輕裝簡從，以免騷擾，乃該兼主席竟通令各縣，廣築機塲跑道，乘用飛機憑空暸望，實失巡察地方，講求治理之本意，卽以所稱用之於偵匪緝私而論，奸匪與私販，多係潛伏民間，行踪飛忽，爲求偵緝防剿，自應切實加强民衆組訓，充實地方自衛武力，與充分發展水陸交通，有綫無綫電訊等項着手，方爲根本之圖。再以剿匪佈防等戰略關係而論，卽認有應用飛機輔助乏必要，亦只宜於省內必要或交通地區，擇其適當地點，扼要建築機塲，配合防剿軍事，相輔而行，豈可通令全省各縣普築機塲，此不獨有失軍事上之意義與作用，且多浪費民力財力物力，徒增民困，反爲奸匪煽惑民心之口實。復查購用之小刑飛機，全爲PA－11式Pipercub，每機僅容二人，原係民航旅行之用，並非軍品，以無軍事設備，高空駕駛無補偵察，至爲明顯。加之所令興建機塲跑道，槪照公路强硬程度辦理，所須長寬面積，多爲人民可以耕種之土地，損失旣廣，征田民力物力浪費尤大。他如建築器材之籌辦，與管理人員之配備，在在需耗鉅款，不可勝計，方今國家財政艱困與人民生計危難之際，凡百措施，非事關重要或必要者，應如何體念時艱，力行　節，以惜民力財力，而維國家財政，該兼主席宋子文身爲政府大員，自宜上體國家之艱難，下念人民之痛苦，勤求治理，福利地方，而竟違法擅權，有虧職守，用特提案糾舉，務請行政院俠法從嚴議處，並加制止，以維國法，而蘇民困。</p>

<p>今天是七年前日本軍閥發動太平洋戰爭的日子，也就是珍珠港被奇襲的日子。從那一天起，太平洋兩岸的中美兩大國，纔眞正站在一條戰綫，共同打擊侵略的日本。有中美以及其他民主國家的聯合作戰，堅持到三年半之久，—中國則更艱苦作戰到八年之久，終於把法西斯軸心的東西三個侵略國打垮了。現在回憶起來，眞令人感慨萬千！</p>
<p>蔣夫人飛赴華府，向美國朝野呼籲加强援華，聞將於今日第一次發表公開宣言，請中國之友自歷史上學習如何拯救文明。我們也願在今天這個有意義的歷史紀念日，向中美兩國人民乃至一切民主國家的人民痛切說明：目前世界任何角落的反共戰爭，都是人人有份的戰爭，救自己，救國家，也是救世界的戰爭，中國遏止共黨武力叛變的戰爭當然不是例外，—尤其美國人不當如隔岸親火的泠淡！</p>
<p>先說救自己：在中國人，當然應該認識剿匪戡亂，十足是救我們每一個人的。五日上海市工界的大團結行動，巳充分表明上海市幾十萬工人先有明碓的認識。相信上海五百萬市民終會有一天怒吼起來的。就使那些爭先逃難的人們，他們也何嘗不知道共匪果眞獲勝，施其殘暴統治，沒有一個安分的國民可有生路。家庭的離散，骨肉的水火，壯丁化作「人海戰術」中的砲灰，婦女變爲配給匪徒的食糧，衣冠文物的國家可以頓變爲男盜女娼的魔窟。假使我們不奮起自救，而羣以逃避爲事，則共匪席捲而來，囊括而去，數千百年相傳之文明，幾萬萬人享有之自由，勢必掃地以盡！就是在美國人乃至一切愛好民主自由的國家人民看來，他們在中國都有僑民，也都有財產事業，他們何嘗可以「撇僑」了事，而能盡保其百年以來辛苦經營之所得？何况中外友好通商的睦誼，百十年來培養出來的「無價之寶」，更不能因聽任共匪之囂張蹂躪而完全犧牲。故中美乃至一切民主國家在遠東在中國趕速締結聯防公約，以阻遏中國的共匪，消滅中國的共匪，實在是救自己的惟一任務。</p>
<p>次說救國家救世界··世界各國的共產黨是整個的，中共當然受共產國際的指揮，以滅亡中國而爲蘇聯附庸，爲其叛變之最終目的。故中國共匪成功之日，即爲中華民國亡國之日！中國人民爲寶愛其民主共和國之國體，不能不及時奮起，以救此垂危垂亡之民國。我們好民主，反極權；愛自由，反專制。我們要用救自己的力量以救國家；更要本救國家的熱誠以救自己。有許多人只知天天盼望「美援」，其實美援遲早必會加强，而最要緊的還是先要自助以救國。國父孫中山先生在其遺著「中國存亡問題」一書中甘以高麗爲喻，他說，「高麗者，銜日本之併吞，尤恨美國之始爲　動，中間坐視。昔人所謂上人着百尺樓，　將梯于去，美之於高麗，勢有若是。…雖然，此豈可以咎美國哉？高麗之亡，恃其不可恃之爲殃，而非美國之咎也。…今者中國又將爲高麗，而使美國再冒此「坐視不救」之惡跡，及其事過境遷。始追論今茲之所畫，悔其謀始之不臧，抑何及矣！」我們今天讀了道段文字，眞有些不寒而慄！當然，我們今天要求美援之加强，自有其光明正大的理由，但最重要的，我們總得先發動人民自身的力量，先來救自己的國家，切莫專怪美國之「坐視不救」。其次，我們要奉勸美國朋友，你們援助中國，也實無異於救你們自己的國家和救世界的人類；因爲中國若果因反共力量不濟，而被蘇聯魔爪的中共所控制，則中國固處於鐵幕以內，即遠東亦必不久盡爲鐵幕所籠罩，那時候西歐何嘗再能瓦全，即美國亦恐未必可以高枕無憂！共產黨世界革命的美夢或將以征服中國爲其嚆矢。故由中國人民的立塲而言，我們固應該提高警覺，時時有「美國未必可恃，亦不必恃」的戒心，而自己奮發，自己努力，用我們的鐵后，擔天下的道義；而由美國人民的立塲言，美國爲天下是非計，爲自身利害計，碓有加强援華的道義上的責任，也惟有美國始有加强援華的軍事上經濟上的力量。</p>
<p>今天正是珍珠港事變的七週年紀念日。中國人民今又站在全世界反共產反極權反侵略的最前綫了！正吿美國友人和一切民主國家的友人，如猶豫徘徊，不加强援華於此日，勢必有第二次珍珠港新加坡被襲的一天！</p>

<p>〔合眾社巴黎七日電〕美代表杜爾斯在聯大政委會辯論朝鮮問題時，號召全球嚴防共黨之恫嚇及暴力。渠控蘇聯支援朝鮮共黨之恐怖行爲反抗聯合國之命。杜氏稱，唯有鐵幕外各國空前團結以防共黨暴行及威脅，始爲締造和平之最佳機會。渠稱：「吾人到處看到外來因素所引起之暴力，恐怖及鬥爭，而策動者則欲藉此達到國際性目的。世上每一非共產國家多少身處此項攻擊之下，其對此祇有一基本防禦方法，厥爲通過聯合國，與受共產威脅壓制之國家在道義上精誠團結，始克有濟。聯合國有一偉大之責任，卽每遇國際有上述恐嚇威脅發生，聯合國應主動表示舉世將用盡一切和平性方法，或藉聯合國或藉恪遵憲章之會員國，使奸計不能獲售。」迄今日爲止，美代表中直言組織反共集團者，當以杜爾斯今日之言爲最激烈。杜爾斯於解釋美國對韓問題之提案時，曾提出一終止爭執之計劃，渠建議由聯合國儘速派遣視察團，以觀察美蘇二國駐軍撇退情形。杜氏請求聯合國承認韓境內美國支持之政府，而不理北韓之共黨政府。杜氏稱，「余希望本案能獲極大多數之贊同。如世界非共產主義之國家能團結一致，反對共黨之策略，則凡專恃武力脅迫及恐怖暴力等手段以謀達到某項國際政治目的者，當可知難而退。和平之最大希望，實繫於是。」杜氏暗示，北韓政府可能卽將獲得中國東北共黨之援助，並力言聯合國決不能漠視韓國問題之嚴重性。社氏稱，韓境佔領軍必須儘速作澈底之撤退，務使韓國人民能眞正自治，而不受憑藉外來力量者之統治或咸脅。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎七日電〕聯大會期尙餘五日，韓國問題之辯論剛才開端，蘇聯已非正式表示將竭力阻止使聯大對韓國問題出以任何行動。</p>
<h3 id="c44">中美澳向聨合國建議　仲承認南韓政府　主張聨合國監禮下撤退佔領軍 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎六日電〕美國今日建議美蘇佔領軍在「儘早可行」之時機，在聯合國特種委會觀察之下，自韓國撤退。此項建議，係以動議之形式，在政委會辯論朝鮮問題時提出。（中澳兩國聯署）。動議中並要求聯合國承認美國支持之南韓政府，爲韓國之唯一合法政府。此舉當係拒絕蘇聯發表之北幃共產政府代表韓國人民之主張。蘇聯則譴責　國在南韓美佔領區建立「警察國」。</p>
<p>在政委會開始辯論朝鮮問題時，蘇聯代表馬立克稱，南韓警察正「大肆迫害南韓之民主領袖」，渠稱，「南韓係一警察國，警察由美佔領軍控制，同時，尉級以上之警官，百分之五十三係以前與日本人合作之官佐」。馬立克指斥聯合國監督之南韓選舉非法，正如希特勒舉辦之民意投票然。政委會以卅四票對六票，否決邀請北幃共產政府代表列席作證，但以卅九票對六票通過聽取南韓政府代表證辭。蘇聯雖已宣稱撇退北韓佔領軍，但美佔領軍則將繼續留駐至南韓足够之國防力量建立之時，因美國認爲如美軍在現時撤退，則蘇聯訓練之北韓軍隊將席捲全韓。故美國建議中之「儘早可行」字句，並非迅卽撇軍之謂。同時，美國要求新朝鮮委員會將被授權視察全韓。按蘇聯曾拒絕前聯合國委會進入北韓，不在聯合國視察下進行選舉，組成北韓共產政府。美國之建議中，並基於南韓政府係在聯合國視察下進行選舉而後組成，故應被承認爲合法之政府。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕美國最高法院今日以五票對四票，決定接受日本戰犯被判絞刑者土肥原與廣田兩名及被處徒刑者木戶宰一，岡敬純，佐藤賢了，島田繁太郎與東鄕茂德五名之上訴，着卽押解來美審訊。法官傑克遜稱與法官由拉克，陶格拉斯，摩飛與羅特里奇等五人贊成接受上訴，首席法官文生曁法官黎特，弗朗梅塞與布頓四人則表示反對。</p>
<p>傑克遜說明其個人贊成接受上訴之理由稱，法院對於接受上訴問題，贊成與反對者人數相等（卽四對四），余倘不參加表決將使美國在全世界人民前尤其是東方人民前，難於解說。美國對於捕獲此輩日本俘虜有重大責任，故對此輩之命運亦有責任。此輩之上訴徜在最高伕院中僵持不決，則當局除執行刑罰外，並無他道，結果將使全世界懷疑美國司法之公正，此乃不可補償之損失，反之，接受上訴乃維持美國司法尊嚴，當能獲我盟友之諒解而不致指爲侵佔國際法庭職權。最高法院定於本月十六日開庭審訊</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京七日電〕中英兩國駐日代表團，七日對美國最高法院決定接受日本兩高級戰犯之上訴，表示驚異。英聯王國盟管會代表蕭氏宣稱：美國最高法院之決定，係破壞盟國軍事法庭威望之驚奇行動，對盟國軍事法庭之「法律立塲」，不啻爲一種打擊。蕭氏稱：「此事似乎部份承認遠東軍事法庭並非國際法庭，而爲美國總統所建立之主張，吾人認爲遠東軍事法庭之權力係來自遠東委員會，如美國高等法院繼續行動，此項新主張勢將損毀遠東軍事法庭之判決在國際公法中之法律立塲。。」盟管會中國代表商震將軍之發言人，亦同樣宣稱：渠對美國高等法院之決定，深感驚奇。蘇聯代表團發言人稱：盟管會蘇聯代表特拉夫揚柯將軍本日事繁，不克對此事有所評述。麥帥本人則亦無立卽之反響。據接近麥帥之高級官員對合衆社稱：在美國最高法院未對土肥原及廣田之上訴採取行動前，處死之七高級戰犯之絞刑，均將延期舉行。在七日淸晨，美國最高法院決定接受上訴之消息，卽傳遍東京。日本協同通訊社稱：最高法院之判決，於七日濟晨爲彈片般地向日本飛來，引起極大之情感騷動，日太法律界人仕則急待獲悉此項決定之法律立塲。此間日本人仕及盟總人仕對最高法院決定接受上訴之舉，咸表驚異，盟總新聞處官員艾吉斯在淸晨宣稱：「無所評述」後，迄今未有任何文吿發表。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕招商局爲期澈底明瞭此次「江亞」輪失事原因，昨特邀請本市航業界專家及新聞記者，撥派民字三〇九號專輪一艘，駛赴出事地點詳細勘察。應邀前往之專家計有中國油輪公司副總經理顧久寬，輪機師總會理事長陸良炳，中國造船工程學會理事長楊俊生，中國油輪公司總工程司朱天秉，交大造船系主任葉在馥，交大機械系敎授柴志明，新任上海航政局長洪瑞濤，美籍航政專家戈饒登，鮑斯，商船聯合會總幹事姜克尼，航政局技術員林國勇，宋金麟，船長周啓新等十三人，招商局船務部經理黃慕宗，總工程司辛一心，總輪機長張令法，海事組主任范崙，江亞輪船長沈達才，輪機長胡彩揚等亦均隨同前往。專輪於上午十時半啓椗，下午一時十分抵達，當由該局停泊該處進行打撈工作之「國泰」號駁輪，轉載全體人員登江亞輪露出水面部份寶地勘查。江亞輪雖已沉沒，但尙有駕駛台頂全部露出水面，船首朝南偏東，船身並不傾側，烟囱及其週圍之風筒亦未倒塌，在距離烟囱約九十尺處尾部右舷有極厚之角鐵翹起，木板碎片不斷由此飄出，據專家斷定此處確係爆炸所由起。至船頂前後桅間之電綫，牽引纜等俱己震斷，前後桅並略有傾　，足登出事時爆炸力極大。</p>
<p>船長追述出事情形</p>
<p>據隨行之「江亞」船長沈達才談：「江亞」設備遠較其他商船爲優，鍋爐氣壓部份每日並有專人輪値看守，出事當日該輪行駛速度極低，根據氣壓未逾限度一點推論，鍋爐決不致爆炸，各專家在勘察烟囱並未倒塌之實際情形後，亦認爲江亞輪失事原因，確非由於鍋爐爆炸。嗣據沈追述出事時情形稱：該輪尾部爆炸聲起時，渠正在船首船長室內預備就寢，祗聞霹靂一聲，宛如雷鳴，渠卽由床邊拌出室外，爬起後電燈已熄，無綫電亦告全毀，未及二三分鐘船身卽完全下沉，故渠判斷此項爆炸物炸力極大，但爆炸聲音又不似魚雷。</p>
<p>適値漲潮無法潛視</p>
<p>專輪上各專家原擬卽派潛水夫入水探視爆破所在之邊綠究係內捲或外翻，以決斷此爆炸物是否外來抑自內發，惟因適値漲潮，危險性大，潛水夫無法工作，故專輪先行回航返滬，全體專家卽在輪上發表共同報吿，略謂：</p>
<p>「七日下午一時許到達「江亞」輪失事地點查看，當時適逢漲潮，看到一江亞」駕駛台頂全部露出水面約五尺，烟肉及其週圍各風筒，舳板吊桿，淡水櫃，太平桶等亦露出水面，可以看清，全部完整，毫無損傷跡象。後桅稍向後　，並在後桅貼近右前方，有角鐵數根，錯綜向上豎起，該處似係二副臥室及報務員室之房頂橫樑受爆炸所致。以上所見情形，斷定絕非鍋爐爆炸，而推測爆炸地點，當在第三貨艙後部右舷，距離烟囱約九十尺（鍋爐卽在烟囱下面），至於爆炸物之內在或外來，須待潛水夫探索破攘情形後方可推斷。」</p>

<p>十月份京滬等地配米遲延，各方頗爲非議，惟十月份期內，正舉國大都市經濟斷洗，物資供應失常之際，糧食供應亦不能例外，如十月份期內，該會在江西已購到食米五萬石，原擬交滬配售，不料爲贛省府扣留，不予放行，以致十月份上海配糧糧源受到影響。十一月份該會供應上海市配糧糧額，依據戶口數，應爲五二六，七七六市石，除已交滬民調會約二十萬市石外，另三十二萬餘市石，該會正分頭催促各訂約行庫如期交貨，期能於本月廿五日前交足，以供上海民調會配售之用·另該會爲彌補國家行庫採購力量之不足，復直接委託糧商採購，以望糧源之疏暢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國棉聯購委員會，昨假中央銀行召開例會，討論結果，認爲現有購棉資金不敷週轉，決定由國行及紡建公司再增資二億元。聞已繳資金巳在二億元以上，合共巳達四億餘元。民營各紗廠迄目前爲止，幾已全部退出聯購，故購棉資金實際已由國行及紡建公司對半負擔。</p>
<p>又昨日另一重要決議案，決定在本月底以前，收足國棉五十萬擔。迄目前爲止，巳收到之國棉共達二十一萬擔。所收之棉，以來自漢口者最多，約佔五萬擔。上海附近·西安·南通·浙江·沙市·各地次之，自三萬擔至一萬擔不等。</p>

<p>棉紗市勢平穩，各紗起落甚微，人心仍頗堅定，貨主售意依然淡泊，但新買亦少問津，故塲上供求兩平，結果各紗漲多跌少。</p>

<p>又訊：據聞以美援棉花棉紗比率之不合理，使各廠實感賠累過鉅，無法繼續，特於最近連開會議，商討適當辦法。經研究結果，以目下紗價而論，掉換比率，原定棉花磅數，至少應提高百分之五十。各廠已由棉紡公會備文呈請增加工繳費用，以二十支紗一包，換八分之七纖維棉花七〇五磅，美援棉花小組，決定在明日再度開會討論以便具體決定。</p>

<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>我們很難指出一個國家，沒有穩定的政治勢力的先決條件，而有長足的工業上的進步的。只有瑞士和比利時是例外，這兩個國家都是由於列强均勢所造成的特殊例子。</p>
<p>在今後相當長的時期內，中國還不能靠自己的能力來保證外國勢力的不侵入。蘇聯在目前還不能給予某一國以保護，因爲目前他們提不出合理的利益要求。聯合國本該對一切國家明白提供這種安全的保證，可是在美蘇兩國目前的利害衝突沒有解除以前，聯合國還不能辦到這一點，因爲任何一國對於對方所提的解決方案都可以使用否決權。</p>
<p>在世界各國中，祇有美國賦有充份的政治權，能够給予中國以土地及政治完整的有效保證。天國在過去五十年中曾經聲明過，中國的完整是它的重要的利害關係之一。它是能够給予這種保證的唯一强國，甚至可以說那保證不是一種帝國主義的統治工具。美國已經在菲律濱明白表現該地區的最後得到眞正的獨立，不僅是口頭上的諾言，而且是可能在政治上實踐的諾言。美國曾經冒着大險，並以重大的代價，表明它不願干涉中國事件。英國准訐印度自治，准許緬甸獨立，也會表明類似的態度，但是無力給予中國以完整的保證。因此，沒有同時解決國內和國外的政治問題而欲解決中國的政治問題，是難以想像的；沒有美國的援助而欲實際解決這些問題，更是難以想像的。美國苟欲抵制莫斯科宣傳的惡果，它的政策的決定和公開宣佈必須是很巧妙的。</p>
<p>欲使這些解決發生效果，中國國內的社會問題亦必同時解決。中國需要民衆敎育作爲加强自工業以至政治的一切事物現代化的基礎。中國亟需社會生活的新因素，逐漸代替中團織庭在社會中所負的原來的使命，這使命已在戰學期間遭到挫折，恐不復能恢復其原來的重要性了。</p>
<p>這些問題又牽涉到行政問題。中國缺乏有訓練有經騐的行政官。它的手工藝和商業技能，並沒有達到我們所知道的行政效率。中國商人的記帳方法是這樣的：他自己能够報吿營業狀况，但是公正的查帳員不能客觀地檢查出或估計出他的營業狀况。在這種塲合不能應用統計方法，而沒有統計便不能有經濟政策。例如現代的營業稅不能以此種記帳方法爲依據。</p>
<p>這是一個倫理學和商業習慣問題，不是學校裏的課程所能敎授的。這問題不是僅僅派送中國學生赴美留學，或派遣美國敎授赴華所能解決的。它和整個經濟政治道德的基礎有着密切關係，它的解決仍有賴於基本的政治問題的解決。</p>
<p>這許多局部問題，工業，經濟，政治和其他問題，必須在民主問題解決以前先行解決。有人以爲民主主義是一種簡單的制度，只要通過一種宣布這主義的文書，便可以成立；這是現代思想的最大錯誤之一。因此，凡是已經通過一種「民主的」憲法的國家，就以新生的民主國家來歡迎它。而還沒有做到這一點的國家，却被斥爲頭腦錯誤，心地惡劣，和意志落後。</p>
<p>民主精神無論在那一個國家，沒有在一世的時期中就能建立起來的，而且沒有好的環境也不能建立起來的。民主主義的開端是一個發展的過程，不是一個突發的事件。英國的民主政治的建立曾經經過一連串的改革，從一八三二年起經歷一個世紀，建立在國會和內閣制的基礎上。美國民主政治的產生，不是由於「獨立宣言」，而是由於從傑弗遜時代起，經過傑克生和林肯時代，一直到婦女參政時代的民主主義的逐漸發展。我們變成一個民主國家，曾經經過長時期的訓練和折磨，而我們還沒有達到終極目的，我們如果屬望其他國家轉眼便成一個民主國家，那是我們忘掉了我們的許多課題了。在我們需要艱步進行的，我們不能給中國一條「魔氈」呌它去騰空而行</p>
<p>中國需要動力，工業和高速度的資本累積，而且是急不及待的。中國急於需要立法的決議，而且對於成立此種決議比較憲政更迅速的獨裁制，有被吸引過去的可能。</p>
<p>中國會不會發展到民主政治？這是一個很微妙的問題。中國可能那樣，但是或許不會。這要看促進有利於民主政治的條件的援助如何而定，因爲過去十年中的趨勢是恰恰相反的，而中國自己沒有能力轉變這趨勢。以緩急而論，最緊要的是軍事勢力和政治安定，其次是經濟狀况的改善，第三是政治的民主化。</p>
<p>一般人對於中闕反共軍隊表示失望，大槪由於國民政府的前途的無望所致。要住在中國以外的人觀察到或覺察到沒有組織的生械的存在，這是非常困難的。</p>
<p>所幸這種生機的確存在，其形式配合着三民主義中的地方創制權·最近的一個例證便是華北民氣的昂揚。若干精確的觀察家批評北平的傳作義將軍是中國能力最高强的反共領袖。他發動地方民衆支持他的軍隊，藉以加强他的軍事力量。他在收復區域內實行緩和的土地改革，以抵抗共產黨的土地革命。他信任老百姓，把鄕村武裝起來，以備抵禦共產黨。北平學生的左傾色彩已經遭到暹制，不是被警察，而是被憤慨的農民的直接抵抗。雖然國民政府沒有給他充分的支持，在傳氏領導下的北方人民，民氣大見增强，同時固守該地區的形勢亦大轉佳。事情漸漸明朗起來，美國不能把華北作爲已經失掉而一筆勾銷，而且要這樣做法的理由更少了，</p>
<p>共產主義有方法使中國問題不能單靠中國的工具來解決。任何中國的軍隊不能很快地打敗中共的軍隊·中共控制着鄕村區域，沒有這些區域，中國農業便不能保持全國的聯繫。中共控制着華北和東北的工業區域，沒有這些區域，中國經濟便不能電行建立。中共如果打勝內戰，可能使全國變成蘇維埃體系。他們有一種學說，主張用簡捷的方法來解決一切問題。共產主義的方法避免民主主義的現實問題，對於一個在一世紀內遭遇到西方國家需要四世紀的發展的國家，似乎在許多方面都比其他任何方法爲簡易而明暸。</p>
<p>所以要解決中國問題，軍事的和經濟的力量都感不足。中國目前不能動員充分的軍事力量，以建立並保證國內的治安·中國在最近的將來不能保設它不受外來的干涉。中國因爲缺乏物資不能自力更生，走向經濟復興之途·中國不能自行羅致管理和技術人才，以支持全面的復興計劃。</p>
<p>美國是唯一能補足中國的缺乏的國家。此外美國尙有其他國際義務，它必須節用財力以期一切義務得到平衡。但是，如果中國得救，則義務與財力的平衡將趨好轉，如果中國喪亡，則該項平衡將趨不利。</p>
<p>我們已經指出，馬克思主義比較適用於一八五〇年歐洲發展階段的國家。對於二十世紀的所謂落後國家，馬克思主義且較十九世紀的歐洲更爲適宜。馬克思共產主義備有一種簡便的藍本，以不民主的方法解決一切經濟，社會·和政治問題。就這觀點而論，美國在本質上是後於馬克思時代的，這個國家曾經通過現代工業進步所引起的最嚴重的問題而沒有損害民主政治的精髓。但是美國並沒有爲謀他國的利益而提供怎樣取法於它的說明。在這方面中國顯然是一個試騐塲所。假如前於馬克思時代的國家能懂得追隨後於馬克思時代的國家，而不走入共產主義的歧途，那麼和平民主世界的目標是不遠了·美國必須和這些國家合作，想出那方伕來。給予中國以眾事上的·經濟上的·及政治上的援助，乃是達到我們的目的所不可避免的手段。</p>
<p>但是最大的需要是中美兩國間知識上的合作·有許多事情需要研究。共產黨曾經化了三十年的時間，研究怎樣使落援國家直接實行共產主義，怎樣縮短資本主義的發展過程，和怎樣無限期延緩民主政治的發展的理論和策略。我們也曾研究並指示怎樣去克服資本主義的重大禍害。但是我們還沒有檢討或分析或了解我們自己的成就。</p>
<p>我們已做到了五大經濟和政治要件，雖尙未臻完善境地，然仍在生生不滬中。第一要件是私有財產，爲關於經濟的個人創造力及個人尊嚴的不可少的基礎。第二要件是生產量的不斷增大，遠超過馬克思主義者所預言的資本主義必然變成生產不良的程度。第三要件是政治的逐步趨向民主化和言論自由及投票自由的遂步實現。第四要件是多數表決制的維持，如果沒有這種制度，政治必演變到全體表決制的地步。第五要件是對其他民族自由的尊重，如表現於菲律濱者。</p>
<p>這些原理實現於美洲者雖未臻於十全十美地步，在這世界裏欲求十全十美是沒有希望的，但是在其不斷進步中，證明了馬克思主義者的預言是錯誤的，因爲我們現已完成馬克思和列寗所認爲不可能的事物。我們目前雖還不免有瑕疵，需要繼續不斷的努力，然而我們已經經過了五十年的發展，超出了共產主義的預言家所設定的錯誤的範圍。這不但否認了馬克思主義，而且是認了和平與自由在人類社會中有實現的可能性。</p>
<p>現在，我們必須澈底明白我們爲什麼要那樣做法，以便給予中國人和其他許多民族以明顯的示範，使他們相信他們也能那樣做法，他們能够找到一條從現在的境界走向我們的境界的直捷可通行的道路，避免通過資本主義和帝國主義的災害的歷史的曲徑。為爭取人們的信心，這條路最低限度必須是偈共產主義一樣的一條似乎可取的捷徑。但是最低限度不是極限。這任務雖離完成的日予還很遠，但是已經開始，而且一個更簡單，更直接，更有希望的方針已經顯露端倪了。不管我們的命運是戰爭或是和平，我們必須和中國合作，而且可能和中國合作，爲全世界的民族尋求現代的民主的和非共產主義的途徑。（全文完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Annihilation War Waged Between the Huai and Fei Rivers; National Army Continues to Advance; Twenty Communist Columns Encircled <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Bengbu, 7th] The Huai-Su Campaign is about to undergo a major development. The National Army, advancing northwest along the Huai and Fei Rivers in a pincer movement, continued its progress today. The stubbornly resisting remnants of the 6th, 13th, and 2nd Communist Columns have found it difficult to withstand the overwhelming pressure of the National Army’s crack troops. At present, a certain unit of the National Army's right pincer has extended to the vicinity of Guzhen. According to intelligence received a few days ago, the main force of the Communist bandits had long left the area. It is widely rumored this afternoon that it has already been recovered, but the military has not confirmed it, only stating that it may be captured tonight. (Note: A Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th claimed that the National Army had entered Guzhen, which was likely a rumor.) Huang Wei's Corps, under the cover of a strong air force, is now launching an attack on the southeast side of the enemy's position and has achieved considerable success. According to officials from the front lines, the distance between Huang Wei's Corps and the vanguard of the northwest-pursuing troops is extremely close. Furthermore, the westward-advancing troops are still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist bandits on the north bank of the Huai River near Linhuanji.</p>
<p>[Our News Agency] New York, 7th (Broadcast from Nanjing): According to government sources, the Communist army launched a fierce offensive against the National Army southwest of Suxian in order to break through the National Army's interception line. The report also stated that the Second Army Corps of the National Army, with 100,000 men, has deployed its forces in Yongcheng and Wuxian, preparing to launch a large-scale annihilation war against the Communist army. The report further stated that twelve Communist columns, approximately 108,000 men, are attempting to break through the National Army's defense line. It is claimed that additional National Army forces are reinforcing the National Army's defense line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Military News: The annihilation war against the bandits in the Huai River basin continued from the evening of the 6th to the 7th in the southwestern Suxian area. Chen Yi’s 7th Column attempted to reinforce from Suxian. Liu Bocheng's troops in the Shuangduiji area were severely attacked by our forces, suffering over 2,000 casualties and retreating in defeat. Along the Jinpu Railway, the National Army, moving north, after defeating the remnants of Chen Yi's 2nd Column on both sides of Baojiaji and Songjiawei on the 6th, continued its northward advance. The right-wing corps of the National Army, advancing southward toward Xuzhou, is now engaged in a mopping-up operation to capture the remnants of the Communist bandits who fled to eastern Henan. On the 6th, they intercepted the main force of Chen Yi's bandits from Lisi, Xiangshanmiao, and Mengji (all east of Yongcheng), killing over 5,000 Communist soldiers. The remnants of Chen Yi's bandit forces east of Yongcheng are exhausted, and the National Army is concentrating on annihilating them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Military News: The war in the Huai and Fei River basins in northern Anhui, up to the border area between Henan and Anhui, is becoming increasingly favorable to the National Army, which is confident of victory. The three major army corps of the National Army, under the command of General Du Yuming, joined forces with the two major army corps moving north across the Fei River, forming a pincer encirclement outside Suxian and Guzhen. They launched a combined attack on the twenty columns of Communist bandit forces under Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng in the area. As of the 7th, the National Army, with Huang Wei's Corps as its core, firmly defended Shuangduiji, closely drawing in nine columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit forces (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, and 10th) and Chen Geng's bandit forces (4th and 9th) around it. After days of joint army-air force attacks, the Communist forces suffered extremely heavy casualties. Chen Yi's bandit forces (2nd, 4th, 9th, 12th, 16th, Liangguang, and Bohai) totaling seven columns, with Suxian as their center, protected the northern flank of Chen Geng and Liu Bocheng's bandit forces and attempted to prevent the National Army from advancing southward from the northwest to attack the Shuangduiji periphery. Chen Yi's bandit forces (2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th) totaling four columns, with the area north of Guzhen as their center, protected Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandit forces from attacking the southeast of Shuangduiji. The National Army, moving south and north, had completed the encirclement of the three units of Chen, Liu, and Chen from the northwest and southeast on the outer line. The three bandit units repeatedly charged east and west without success. Our Huang Wei's Corps in Shuangduiji, under the cover of the air force, is tightening its grip on Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandit forces. The National Army's encirclement is shrinking daily. The twenty columns of bandits in this area are weakening daily under the National Army's siege.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Tangshan, 7th] The great battle in eastern Hebei is gradually entering a mature stage, with both sides actively deploying. It is now reported that large numbers of Communist troops are gathering in Zunhua, Yutian, Jixian, Yanrun, and the border area between Hebei, Rehe, and Liaoning, and they have been rushing supplies into the pass in recent days.

<p>[Our News Agency] New York, 7th (Broadcast from Nanjing): The first batch of military supplies under the US$125 million American aid program to China has begun to arrive in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 6th] Yang, head of the Chinese military purchasing mission in the United States, arrived here today from Washington on his way back to China.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to sources close to the State Department on the 6th, if the Chinese Communists occupy Shanghai, the United States will use all its strength to protect American commercial interests. However, the source made it clear that the State Department has not made any guarantees, and American businessmen who remain in the area do so at their own risk. According to various indications, US consular officials have received instructions to protect American interests with all their strength in case of emergency. The source pointed out that US consular officials in Shanghai will continue their duties, just as the US consulate remained in Shenyang when the Communists entered. They stated that the United States has publicly announced that the US consulate will continue to operate and will provide possible assistance to American citizens, but at present, firm and rapid regulations cannot be announced. Well-informed sources pointed out that when American citizens who are "non-essential" receive advice to withdraw from China, it is up to the American citizens themselves to determine who are "essential" and "non-essential." Those who are deemed "essential" may be allowed to remain, which can be interpreted as US consular officials will fully protect them and their interests.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] The American commercial firm controlling the Shanghai Power Company revealed on the 6th that the company had requested the US government to use US Marines to protect its factories in Shanghai. An official of the Electric Bond and Share Company told United Press on the 6th that this request was made several days ago, but we cannot guarantee that our request will be granted or whether it is possible to grant it. The company's statement came three days after representatives of more than 30 American commercial firms with large businesses in China held a meeting in New York to discuss US policy toward China. According to well-informed sources, a representative of the State Department was also present, including Walter Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the department. Mr. Butterworth came to New York from Washington to explain the meaning of the State Department's warning to American businessmen to withdraw their families and staff and to make general preparations for the possibility of the Communists occupying Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 6th] Some British and American merchants in Tianjin said today that they are willing to stay here even if the situation deteriorates, but if the Communist army mistreats foreigners or prohibits their trade, foreign merchants will have no choice but to withdraw in the end. According to a representative of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the agency intends to remain in Tianjin to continue relief work, but may change its plan if it receives orders from Washington.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Qingdao, 7th] US Marines can be sent from here to land in Shanghai at any time to protect overseas Chinese. This has been confirmed by well-informed sources. The 3,000 Marines originally stationed in Qingdao are still stationed in their original barracks, while the 1,300 who recently arrived in Qingdao from Guam are still waiting on ships for orders. Previously, dozens of soldiers had been sent to Beijing and Tianjin to protect overseas Chinese. If military developments reach a certain level, the US military will take the above-mentioned action.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Song Ziwen Indicted for Privately Purchasing Airplanes and Building Airfields; Supervisory Yuan Lacks Full Text of the Indictment Case <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie, Deng Jingfu, Guo Zhongwei, etc., proposed at the end of last month to indict Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, for privately purchasing airplanes and ordering all counties in Guangdong to build airfield runways. The proposal was subsequently established after review by Supervisory Committee members Zhang Dinghua, Li Zheng’e, Cao Haosen, etc., and has recently been submitted to the Executive Yuan. The Supervisory Yuan today released the original text of the indictment case as follows: Song Ziwen, Director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters and Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to facilitate his inspection of the territory under his jurisdiction and to detect bandits, suppress smuggling, and transmit orders, issued an order on July 18th of this year in his capacity as Chairman of the Provincial Government, instructing all subordinate counties to rush to build airfield runways on a deadline. In August of the same year, he used foreign exchange to privately purchase six small civilian airplanes from the United States, which were transported to Guangdong for use. At that time, the public was resentful and public opinion condemned him, but he disregarded it and insisted on going his own way, which shows his arrogance and arbitrariness. The purchase and use of airplanes and the construction of airfields should fall within the jurisdiction of the central government and should be handled in a unified manner by the central government after considering the actual situation and needs. Local leaders have no right to act on their own, as expressly stipulated in Article 107 of the Constitution. Song Ziwen, as the acting chairman, privately purchased airplanes and built airfield runways without first reporting to the central government for approval or subsequently submitting them to the competent authorities for approval. This constitutes a violation of the law and exceeds his authority, which is a disruption of the military and political system and an encroachment on the powers of the central government. As for the construction of airfields everywhere, the intention of which is to facilitate inspections, it is not appropriate in light of reason and sentiment. As a local leader, when inspecting the territory under his jurisdiction, he should go deep into the countryside, get close to the people, and diligently seek out their grievances. Even if he cannot travel incognito, he should travel light and simply to avoid disturbing the people. However, the acting chairman ordered all counties to build airfield runways and used airplanes to survey from the air, which is contrary to the original intention of inspecting the localities and seeking governance. Even if it is said that it is used for detecting bandits and suppressing smuggling, bandits and smugglers often lurk among the people and move around unpredictably. In order to detect, suppress, and defend against them, the focus should be on strengthening the organization and training of the masses, enriching the local self-defense forces, and fully developing water and land transportation, wired and wireless communications, etc., which is a fundamental plan. Furthermore, from the perspective of strategic relations such as bandit suppression and defense deployment, even if it is recognized that it is necessary to use airplanes for assistance, airfields should only be built at necessary locations or transportation areas within the province, and they should be coordinated with military defense and suppression efforts. How can the order be issued to build airfields everywhere in all counties of the province? This not only lacks military significance and effect, but also wastes manpower, financial resources, and materials, increasing the people's difficulties and providing an excuse for bandits to instigate the people. Furthermore, the small airplanes purchased are all PA-11 Pipercub models, each of which can only accommodate two people and are intended for civilian air travel, not military products. It is obvious that they lack military equipment, and high-altitude flight does not aid in reconnaissance. In addition, the airfield runways ordered to be built are all built to the same level of hardness as highways, and the required length, width, and area are mostly land that the people can cultivate, resulting in widespread losses and a great waste of land, manpower, and materials. Other expenses, such as the preparation of construction materials and the allocation of management personnel, require huge sums of money and cannot be counted. At a time when the country's finances are difficult and the people's livelihood is precarious, all measures that are not important or necessary should embody the difficulties of the times and practice diligence and thrift to save the people's manpower and financial resources and maintain the country's finances. Song Ziwen, as a senior government official, should understand the country's difficulties and the people's suffering, diligently seek governance, and benefit the localities, but instead, he has violated the law and exceeded his authority and failed in his duties. Therefore, a special proposal is made to indict him and request the Executive Yuan to deal with him strictly in accordance with the law and to stop him in order to maintain the national law and relieve the people's difficulties.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Taixian, 7th] The Jiangyan garrison, after struggling for two days and nights, finally ran out of ammunition at noon on the 6th and all sacrificed heroically. It is reported that the attacking bandits totaled more than 20,000, personally commanded by bandit leader Huang Yifeng, with more than 40 cannons of various calibers and more than 200 light and heavy machine guns. They bombarded with artillery at night and launched human-wave attacks on the strongholds during the day. The defending troops fought bravely, advancing one after another until noon on the 6th, when all the fortifications of the strongholds were destroyed, and they were cut off from reinforcements and ran out of ammunition, so the bandits broke in. In summary, after this battle, the bandits, with a force twenty times larger than the garrison, fired a total of more than 3,000 shells. The defending troops killed or wounded more than 4,000 bandits. The local garrison of fewer than 1,000 men achieved such a glorious record that it has already achieved compensation.</p>

During the second explosion, five people, including the captain of the police defense squadron, were injured, the gas machine was blown up, and the sulfur atmosphere was suffocating. The air force dormitory near the explosion site was affected. The number of deaths and injuries is still unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Save Ourselves! Save the Nation! Save the World! <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the day, seven years ago, when Japanese militarists launched the Pacific War, the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. From that day on, the two major nations on both sides of the Pacific, China and the United States, truly stood on the same battle line, jointly fighting against the invading Japan. With the joint operations of China and the United States, as well as other democratic countries, persisting for as long as three and a half years—China fought even more arduously for as long as eight years—the three Axis aggressor nations were finally defeated. Looking back now, it is truly filled with countless emotions!</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek flew to Washington to appeal to the American government and the public to strengthen aid to China. It is said that she will issue her first public declaration today, asking China's friends to learn from history how to save civilization. We also wish to take advantage of this meaningful historical anniversary to explain to the people of China and the United States, and even to the people of all democratic countries: Any anti-communist war in any corner of the world is a war in which everyone has a part to play. Saving oneself, saving the nation, is also saving the world. China's war to contain the communist armed rebellion is certainly no exception—especially the American people should not be indifferent, like watching a fire from across the river!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about saving ourselves: For the Chinese people, of course, we should realize that suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is entirely to save each and every one of us. The great unity action of the Shanghai industrial community on the 5th has fully demonstrated that hundreds of thousands of workers in Shanghai have a clear understanding. I believe that one day the five million citizens of Shanghai will roar. Even those who are rushing to escape, how can they not know that if the communist bandits truly win and implement their brutal rule, no peace-loving citizen can survive. Families will be broken, brothers will fight each other, young men will be turned into cannon fodder in the "human wave tactics," and women will become food rations for the bandits. The nation of civilized clothing and artifacts can suddenly become a den of male thieves and female prostitutes. If we do not rise up to save ourselves and instead focus on escaping, then when the communist bandits sweep in and take everything away, the civilization passed down for thousands of years and the freedom enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people will inevitably be completely wiped out! Even from the perspective of the American people and the people of all democratic and free countries, they all have expatriates and property and businesses in China. How can they simply "abandon" them and fully protect what they have worked hard to build for a hundred years? What's more, the friendly trade relations between China and foreign countries, the "priceless treasure" cultivated over a hundred years, cannot be completely sacrificed by allowing the communist bandits to run rampant. Therefore, it is the sole task to save themselves for the United States and even all democratic countries to quickly conclude a joint defense treaty in the Far East and in China, in order to curb the communist bandits in China and eliminate the communist bandits in China.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about saving the nation and saving the world... The communist parties of all countries in the world are a whole. The Chinese Communist Party is of course under the command of the Communist International, with the ultimate goal of destroying China and becoming a Soviet appendage. Therefore, the day the Chinese communist bandits succeed will be the day the Republic of China perishes! The Chinese people, in order to cherish the democratic republic, must rise up in time to save this precarious Republic. We love democracy and oppose totalitarianism; we love freedom and oppose autocracy. We must use our power to save ourselves to save the nation; and we must use our enthusiasm to save the nation to save ourselves. Many people only know how to look forward to "U.S. aid" every day. In fact, U.S. aid will be strengthened sooner or later, but the most important thing is to first help ourselves to save the country. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, used Korea as a metaphor in his posthumous work "The Question of China's Survival." He said, "Korea hates Japan's annexation even more, especially because the United States started [to help], but sat idly by in the middle. As the ancients said, 'Those who go up to the hundred-foot building will remove the ladder.' The situation of the United States in Korea is like this... However, how can this be blamed on the United States? Korea's demise was caused by relying on what could not be relied on, and it is not the fault of the United States... Today, China is about to become Korea again, and the United States will once again be accused of 'sitting idly by and not helping.' When things have passed, we will regret that we did not plan well from the beginning, but it will be too late!" Today, when we read these words, we feel a chill down our spines! Of course, we have our legitimate reasons for demanding increased U.S. aid today, but the most important thing is that we must first mobilize the power of the people themselves and save our own country first. Do not blame the United States for "sitting idly by and not helping." Secondly, we want to advise our American friends that your aid to China is no different from saving your own country and saving mankind in the world; because if China is indeed controlled by the CCP, the claws of Soviet Union, due to the weakness of the anti-communist forces, then China is in the iron curtain. The Far East will soon be shrouded in the iron curtain. How can Western Europe be able to remain unscathed? The United States may not be able to rest easy! The communist party's dream of world revolution may begin with the conquest of China. Therefore, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, we should raise our awareness and always have the vigilance that "the United States may not be reliable, and it is not necessary to rely on it," and strive ourselves, work hard, and use our iron shoulders to uphold the righteousness of the world; and from the standpoint of the American people, for the sake of right and wrong in the world, and for the sake of their own interests, the United States has the moral responsibility to strengthen aid to China, and only the United States has the military and economic power to strengthen aid to China.</p>
<p>Today is the seventh anniversary of the Pearl Harbor incident. The Chinese people are now standing on the front line of the world's anti-communist, anti-totalitarian, and anti-aggression struggle! I hereby inform American friends and friends from all democratic countries that if they hesitate and do not strengthen aid to China today, there will inevitably be a second Pearl Harbor and Singapore will be attacked!</p>

First, the report matters were passed. In addition to listening to the Executive Yuan's written reply to the two inquiries on disaster relief and the opening of private air transport business, the Examination Yuan's request to review the draft amendment to the Organization Law of the Ministry of Personnel Affairs and the Executive Yuan's request to review the amendment to Article 4 and the deletion of Article 13 of the Organization Regulations of the County Judicial Office, and the amendment to the mining tax rate and fine amount in the Mining Law were all submitted for review separately. Then, the discussion matters were carried out: (1) The Labor and Social Committees reported the review of the proposal by Yuan Qihui, An Futing, and others to amend the relevant provisions of the Trade Union Law in order to meet the actual needs of workers. The second reading continued, and it was resolved to amend and pass the revised draft after review and to conduct the third reading at the next meeting. (2) The proposal by Wu Shi Peng et al. to implement "Land to the Tiller" and simultaneously solve the problems of military service, production, education, and relief to facilitate bandit suppression and national construction was resolved to be submitted to the Land Administration Committee for review, and each of the National Defense, Economic and Financial, Education and Culture, and Social Committees should recommend one to three members to participate. (3) The Finance Committee reported the review and amendment of Article 5 of the Business License Tax Law. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed. (The amended article is published on the fourth page).

(The amended articles are on the left corner) (6) The National Defense and Legal System Committees reported the consolidated review of the draft Regulations on Military Compensation.

<p>The meeting continued at 3:40 pm, continuing to discuss item (6), the Regulations on Military Compensation, which was resolved to be amended and passed. (7) The National Defense and Legal System Committees reported the review of the draft amendment to the Organization Regulations of the Provincial Security Command. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed. (8) The Social and Maritime Affairs Committees reported the review of the draft amendment to the Fishermen's Association Law. It was resolved to amend and pass it as reviewed. (9) The Finance, Agriculture and Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committees reported the review of the proposal by Xie E et al. to amend the items related to chemical artificial fertilizers in the Customs Import Tariff to reduce the burden on the people and encourage increased production. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, and the tax rates for various chemical artificial fertilizers were greatly reduced (detailed in another telegram). (10) The Legal System Committee reported the review of the proposal by Jiang Yiping et al. to revise Article 30 of the Lawyers Law. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, canceling the restriction that lawyers could not serve as speakers or deputy speakers of public opinion organs, and amending the article to "Lawyers shall not hold concurrent public office, but this shall not apply to those who hold specific temporary positions in central or local agencies." (11) The Agriculture and Forestry and Water Conservancy Committees reported the temporary suspension of the application of the proviso of Article 12 of the Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Regulations. It was resolved to pass it as is. (12) The Grain Administration and Finance Committees reported the re-examination of the proposal by Qu Zhisheng et al. to establish a grain storage system to regulate grain supply and demand in order to lay the foundation for grain administration. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, but due to the current period of turmoil and the country's financial difficulties, the construction of warehouses and the accumulation of grain are beyond the country's ability, so the original proposal was temporarily reserved. (13) The Finance Committee reported the review of the temporary emergency motion by Huang Shaohong et al. to change the Executive Yuan's current policy and implement the lifting of the gold ban. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, because the Executive Yuan's current policy referred to in the proposal was the policy before the promulgation of the amended regulations on the issuance of gold yuan and the amended regulations on the handling of people's gold, silver, and foreign currency. The current policy framework has already been changed, and gold and silver have been unbanned, so the original proposal has lost its effect and was reserved. (14) The Finance Committee reported the review of the five proposals related to stabilizing the value of gold yuan, etc., submitted by Shen Chongyu et al., Liu Shidu et al., Luo Heng et al., Liao Weifan et al., and Gu Hegao et al. It was resolved to pass it as reviewed, because the recent economic turmoil has caused great changes in the value of gold yuan, and further review must be conducted depending on the development situation, so they were all reserved. (15) Mu Chao et al. proposed to request the government to launch a nationwide spiritual mobilization to strengthen bandit suppression, reform politics, and complete national construction. Some members believed that spiritual mobilization was a social movement that could be implemented directly without the need for the Legislative Yuan to enact a law, so it was decided to reserve it. As for proposal (16) by Qi Zhihou et al. to request the government to accuse the Soviet Union to the United Nations of assisting the Chinese Communists in invading Northeast China and threatening world peace, due to insufficient time, it was not discussed and it was decided to leave it for the next meeting. At the end of the meeting, the temporary motion by Li Shijun, Wu Wangqi, and others was passed, submitting written inquiries to the government on the issue of personnel appointments after the appointment of President Yu of the Central Bank and the recent unauthorized continuous price increases in state-owned transportation enterprises, which stimulated prices and disrupted people's hearts. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 pm.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Terror and Violence Threaten the World; US Calls for International Unity; Dulles Emphasizes Resolution to Support Korean Independence <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] U.S. representative Dulles, during the UN Political Committee's debate on the Korean issue, called on the world to guard against the intimidation and violence of the communists. He accused the Soviet Union of supporting the terroristic acts of the Korean communists in defiance of the United Nations' mandate. Dulles claimed that only unprecedented unity among nations outside the Iron Curtain to prevent communist atrocities and threats can create the best opportunity for peace. He stated: "We see everywhere violence, terror, and strife caused by external factors, with the instigators seeking to achieve international goals through this. Every non-communist country in the world is to some extent under this attack. There is only one basic defense method for them: through the United Nations, and moral solidarity with countries threatened and suppressed by communism. The United Nations has a great responsibility. Whenever such intimidation and threats occur internationally, the United Nations should actively indicate that the world will use all peaceful means, either through the United Nations or through member states complying with the Charter, so that conspiracies cannot succeed." To date, Dulles' remarks today are the most radical among U.S. representatives in directly organizing an anti-communist group. While explaining the U.S. proposal on the Korean issue, Dulles presented a plan to end the conflict. He suggested that the United Nations immediately send an inspection team to observe the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops. Dulles requested the United Nations to recognize the U.S.-backed government in Korea and disregard the communist government in North Korea. Dulles stated, "I hope this case will receive the support of an overwhelming majority. If the non-communist countries of the world can unite to oppose the communist strategy, then those who rely solely on military coercion, terror, and violence to achieve a certain international political goal will know that it is difficult to succeed. The greatest hope for peace lies in this." Dulles hinted that the North Korean government may soon receive assistance from the communists in Northeast China and stressed that the United Nations must not disregard the seriousness of the Korean issue. 社氏 claimed that the occupying forces in Korea must withdraw completely as soon as possible, so that the Korean people can truly govern themselves without being ruled or threatened by those relying on external forces.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] With only five days remaining in the UN General Assembly session, the debate on the Korean issue has just begun, and the Soviet Union has informally indicated that it will do everything possible to prevent the UN General Assembly from taking any action on the Korean issue.</p>
<h3 id="e44">US, Australia, and China Propose to the United Nations; Recognize South Korean Government; Advocate Withdrawal of Occupying Forces Under UN Supervision <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] The United States today suggested that U.S. and Soviet occupying forces withdraw from Korea at the "earliest possible" time under the observation of a special UN committee. This suggestion was put forward in the form of a motion during the Political Committee's debate on the Korean issue (co-signed by China and Australia). The motion also requested the United Nations to recognize the U.S.-backed South Korean government as the sole legitimate government of Korea. This move is likely to reject the Soviet Union's claim that the North Korean communist government represents the Korean people. The Soviet Union condemned the U.S. for establishing a "police state" in the U.S.-occupied area of South Korea.</p>
<p>When the Political Committee began debating the Korean issue, Soviet representative Malik stated that the South Korean police were "persecuting South Korean democratic leaders in a big way." He stated, "South Korea is a police state, with the police controlled by the U.S. occupying forces. At the same time, 53 percent of the police officers above the rank of lieutenant are officers who previously collaborated with the Japanese." Malik accused the UN-supervised elections in South Korea of being illegal, just like the public opinion polls conducted by Hitler. The Political Committee voted 34 to 6 against inviting representatives of the North Korean communist government to attend and testify, but voted 39 to 6 to hear the testimony of representatives of the South Korean government. Although the Soviet Union has declared the withdrawal of the North Korean occupying forces, the U.S. occupying forces will continue to remain until South Korea has established sufficient national defense forces. The U.S. believes that if the U.S. military withdraws at this time, the Soviet-trained North Korean army will sweep across the entire Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the phrase "as soon as possible" in the U.S. proposal does not mean an immediate withdrawal of troops. At the same time, the U.S. requests that the new Korean Committee be authorized to inspect all of Korea. The Soviet Union has refused to allow the former UN committee to enter North Korea and conducted elections without UN supervision, forming the North Korean communist government. The U.S. proposal is based on the fact that the South Korean government was formed after elections conducted under UN supervision and should therefore be recognized as the legitimate government.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Appeal Cases of Hiranuma and Other Seven Japanese War Criminals to be Heard by the US Supreme Court Mid-Month; Chinese and British Delegations to Japan Express Deep Surprise <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The U.S. Supreme Court decided today by a vote of five to four to accept the appeals of two Japanese war criminals sentenced to hanging, Doihara and Hiranuma, and five war criminals sentenced to imprisonment, Kido Koichi, Oka Takasumi, Sato Kenryo, Shimada Shigetaro, and Togo Shigenori, and ordered them to be escorted to the U.S. for trial. Judge Jackson stated that he and Judges Byrnes, Douglas, Murphy, and Rutledge voted in favor of accepting the appeals, while Chief Justice Vinson and Judges Reed, Frankfurter, and Burton opposed.</p>
<p>Jackson explained his personal reasons for voting in favor of accepting the appeals, stating that because the number of justices for and against accepting the appeals was equal (i.e., four to four), if he did not participate in the vote, it would be difficult to explain to the people of the world, especially the people of the East. The U.S. has a great responsibility for capturing these Japanese prisoners, and therefore has a responsibility for their fate. If these appeals are deadlocked in the Supreme Court, the authorities will have no choice but to carry out the sentences, which will cause the world to doubt the fairness of the U.S. judiciary. This is an irreparable loss. On the contrary, accepting the appeals maintains the dignity of the U.S. judiciary and can gain the understanding of our allies without being accused of encroaching on the jurisdiction of international tribunals. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] The Chinese and British delegations to Japan expressed surprise on the 7th at the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to accept the appeals of two high-ranking Japanese war criminals. Shawn, representative of the British Commonwealth Allied Council, declared that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision was a surprising action that undermined the prestige of the Allied military tribunal and was a blow to the "legal status" of the Allied military tribunal. Shawn stated, "This seems to partially acknowledge the claim that the Far East Military Tribunal is not an international tribunal but was established by the President of the United States. We believe that the power of the Far East Military Tribunal comes from the Far Eastern Commission. If the U.S. Supreme Court continues to act, this new claim will damage the legal status of the Far East Military Tribunal's verdict in international law." General Shang Zhen, spokesperson for the Chinese representative to the Allied Council, also similarly declared that he was deeply surprised by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. The spokesperson for the Soviet delegation stated that General Travyanko, the Soviet representative to the Allied Council, was busy today and could not comment on the matter. MacArthur himself had no immediate reaction. According to senior officials close to MacArthur, the executions by hanging of the seven high-ranking war criminals who had been sentenced to death would be postponed until the U.S. Supreme Court took action on the appeals of Doihara and Hirota. On the morning of the 7th, the news that the U.S. Supreme Court had decided to accept the appeals spread throughout Tokyo. The Japanese Kyodo News Agency reported that the Supreme Court's ruling came like shrapnel in the morning of the 7th, causing great emotional upheaval. Japanese legal circles were eager to know the legal basis of this decision. Both Japanese and Allied personnel here expressed surprise at the Supreme Court's decision to accept the appeals. Allied General Headquarters Press Officer Ages stated "no comment" in the morning and has not issued any statement since.</p>
<h3 id="e49">General Assembly Scheduled to Conclude on Saturday After Three Months of Meetings Without Major Accomplishments; to Reconvene in New York in April <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The United Nations General Assembly today voted 43 to 13, with two abstentions, to decide that the current session of the General Assembly will close on the evening of the 11th of this month, and will reconvene in New York on April 1st next year to conclude unfinished business. The vote took place after representatives ridiculed themselves and other delegations for failing to complete their work in three and a half months. With a third of the General Assembly's agenda items yet to be raised, representatives took to the rostrum in the Palais de Chaillot one after another to criticize the current session for "too much talk, too little action." Soviet representative Vyshinsky also participated in this universal self-criticism, stating, "There is an endless motion here... This is by no means the way to solve problems." It is estimated that the current session of the General Assembly will cost approximately $356,000. British Secretary of State McNeil predicted that the next session would last even longer. Because Britain urgently needed to resolve the issue of former Italian colonies, it strongly advocated postponing the session after Christmas or closing it only after the work was completed. The General Assembly rejected the Soviet Union's desire to postpone all agenda items until the regular session in September next year.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] Employees of the Berlin power company also split today. Eight hundred anti-communist employees, dissatisfied with the interference of the communist police, switched to working at the Berlin West Zone branch and did not go to the head office in the Soviet zone.

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] As a result of the Berlin West Zone city council elections, the Social Democratic Party won. The party today nominated 58-year-old Reuter as the new mayor. Reuter was once a member of the Communist Party and then left the party.

<h3 id="e62">Experts Survey the Jiang Ya Steamer: Determine It Was Not a Boiler Explosion; Whether the Explosive Was Internal or External Remains to Be Investigated <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to thoroughly understand the cause of the "Jiang Ya" steamer disaster, yesterday specially invited experts from the shipping industry in this city and news reporters, dispatching a special boat No. 309 (民字三〇九號) to go to the scene of the accident for detailed investigation. The experts invited to attend included Gu Jiukuan, Deputy General Manager of China Tanker Company; Lu Liangbing, Chairman of the Association of Marine Engineers; Yang Junsheng, Chairman of the Chinese Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers; Zhu Tianbing, Chief Engineer of China Tanker Company; Ye Zaifu, Head of the Department of Naval Architecture at Jiaotong University; Chai Zhiming, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Jiaotong University; Hong Ruitao, the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau; American maritime experts Gorham, Baus; Jiang Keni, Secretary-General of the Merchant Marine Federation; Lin Guoyong and Song Jinlin, technicians from the Maritime Affairs Bureau; Captain Zhou Qixin, and thirteen others. Huang Muzong, Manager of the Shipping Department of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Xin Yixin, Chief Engineer; Zhang Lingfa, Chief Marine Engineer; Fan Lun, Director of the Maritime Affairs Section; Shen Dacai, Captain of the Jiang Ya steamer; and Hu Caiyang, Chief Marine Engineer, also accompanied them. The special boat set sail at 10:30 AM and arrived at 1:10 PM. There, the "Guotai" barge, which was carrying out salvage work, transferred all personnel to the exposed part of the Jiang Ya steamer for inspection. Although the Jiang Ya steamer had sunk, the entire top of the bridge was still visible above the water. The bow faced south-southeast, and the ship's hull was not tilted. The smokestack and the surrounding vents had not collapsed. About 90 feet from the smokestack, there was extremely thick angle iron sticking up on the starboard side of the stern, and pieces of wooden planks were constantly floating out from there. According to experts, this was indeed where the explosion originated. The electrical wires and tow ropes between the fore and aft masts on the ship's deck were all broken, and the fore and aft masts were slightly tilted, indicating that the explosion was extremely powerful at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>Captain Recounts the Circumstances of the Accident</p>
<p>According to Shen Dacai, the Captain of the "Jiang Ya" who accompanied the group, the equipment on the "Jiang Ya" was much better than other merchant ships. There were dedicated personnel on duty every day to watch over the boiler pressure. On the day of the accident, the ship was traveling at a very low speed. Based on the fact that the pressure did not exceed the limit, it can be inferred that the boiler would not have exploded. After inspecting the actual situation of the smokestack not collapsing, the experts also believed that the cause of the Jiang Ya steamer disaster was definitely not due to a boiler explosion. Subsequently, according to Shen’s recollection of the circumstances at the time of the accident: when the explosion sound occurred at the stern of the ship, he was in the captain's cabin at the bow, preparing to go to bed. He only heard a loud noise, like thunder. He immediately stumbled out of the room from the bedside. After getting up, the lights were already out, and the radio was completely destroyed. Within two or three minutes, the ship completely sank, so he judged that the explosive had a very high explosive force, but the sound of the explosion did not sound like a torpedo.</p>
<p>Unable to Submerge Due to High Tide</p>
<p>The experts on the special boat originally planned to send divers into the water to investigate whether the edges of the explosion site were rolled inward or outward in order to determine whether the explosive was external or internal. However, due to the high tide, the danger was high, and the divers could not work. Therefore, the special boat first returned to Shanghai. All the experts then released a joint report on the boat, which stated:</p>
<p>"We arrived at the scene of the "Jiang Ya" steamer disaster at about 1:00 PM on the 7th to inspect it. At that time, it was high tide. We saw the entire top of the bridge of the "Jiang Ya" exposed about five feet above the water. The smokestack and the surrounding vents, deck planks, davits, freshwater tanks, safety buckets, etc. were also exposed and could be seen clearly. They were all intact and showed no signs of damage. The aft mast was slightly tilted backward, and close to the right front of the aft mast, there were several pieces of angle iron sticking up in a complex manner. This area appeared to be the roof beams of the second mate's cabin and the radio operator's room, which were damaged by the explosion. Based on the above observations, it can be determined that it was definitely not a boiler explosion. It is speculated that the location of the explosion was in the rear part of the third cargo hold on the starboard side, about 90 feet from the smokestack (the boiler is directly below the smokestack). As for whether the explosive was internal or external, it will be necessary to wait for the divers to explore the situation of the damage before a conclusion can be drawn."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] Zhen Yanqing, a student at the Law School of Soochow University, sued his classmate Zhou Gan and Wu Xisheng for assault. Judge Zhang Yuanzhen of the District Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon, and many students from the school attended to observe. Yu Yanqing had a medicated plaster on his left cheek, and testified to the court that the injury had not yet healed.</p>
<p>According to his testimony: he is currently employed by the Military Service Association and is studying in the fifth grade of the Law Department of Soochow University at night. He lived in the same dormitory with the two defendants and another classmate. They usually had a good relationship. On October 30th, he heard that someone was planning to sell the remaining rationed rice to supplement the non-staple food expenses. He believed that if there was any remaining rice rationed by the People's Livelihood Association, it should only be returned and not sold, and that selling it would be illegal. He reported this to the Dean of Students and the Head of General Affairs. When he returned to the dormitory at about 10 p.m., Wu immediately turned off the lights and allegedly beat him in various parts of his body. He then ran out of the dormitory, shouting for help and reporting to the school, but received no results. He then reported the incident to the nearby Hongkou Branch Bureau. Later, Dean Liu bailed out the two defendants. At the weekly meeting the following week, Dean Liu had already reported to the students about his assault and that the two had been given demerits.</p>
<p>Defendant Zhou Gan</p>
<p>Testified: "Currently a third-year student in the Law Department. In the past, my relationship with Yu was quite harmonious, but later, because he loved to brag every day and wanted us to flatter him, which we young people dislike the most, he held a grudge against us." He continued: that night he was reading in the dormitory. When Yu returned to the dormitory at about 10 p.m., he asked Yu why he insulted his friend. Then the lights went out, and he and Wu went out first. Yu then went outside and shouted "Help!" Other students in the dormitory, hearing the news, gathered to see what had happened. How Yu was injured, he really didn't know. He flatly denied selling rationed rice or fighting with Yu.</p>
<p>Wu Xisheng Testified</p>
<p>Testified: Currently a fourth-year student in the Accounting Department, and served as the chairman of the Food Committee in October. That night, because it was the end of the month, he was settling accounts in the dormitory. Later, the lights went out, and he went out first, and never participated in the beating. Regarding the plaintiff's claim that he planned to sell rationed rice, he said: The October rationed rice was distributed on the 25th. The rice eaten in the previous two weeks was purchased with loans from the school, so there was very little left by the end of the month. In the past, some students had proposed selling rice, but it was later rejected, so it was not sold. After the two defendants finished testifying, the plaintiff also said: The "friend" that Zhou Gan said he insulted was the introducer for them to sell the rationed rice. The court, considering that both parties were classmates living together day and night, instructed the defendant to apologize to Yu in court to settle the case. Yu insisted on refusing and demanded that the court severely punish them. The court then ruled to reschedule the trial, and will summon the school's Dean of Students, Head of General Affairs, and related students to testify next time.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Rationing in Six Major Cities; Coordinated Procurement for Smoothness; The Grain Storage Committee Decides to Strive to Ensure Uninterrupted Supply <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The spokesperson of the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food recently explained in detail to those capable the committee's planning for grain sources and grain allocation for the rationing of six major cities nationwide.</p>
<p>The committee's procurement of grain sources can be divided into: (1) Entrusting national banks to purchase from grain-producing areas. (2) US Economic Cooperation Administration's supply of foreign rice and the Administration's fertilizer-for-grain program. The committee was established in August of this year, coinciding with the government's currency reform and strict price controls. Farmers and grain merchants, in order to avoid price limits, hid agricultural products, which greatly affected the committee's purchase and transportation work. Moreover, the purchased grain was sometimes diverted for emergency military supplies. In addition, grain exports and transportation were hampered by the lack of transportation tools and the difficulties caused by local governments detaining and withholding transportation. The situation was beyond the imagination of people from all walks of life. However, even in the face of all kinds of difficulties, the committee made its best efforts to procure grain sources to ensure that the supply would not be interrupted.</p>
<p>The delay in rice rationing in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places in October was criticized by various parties. However, during the period of October, when the economies of major cities across the country were undergoing a major transformation and the supply of materials was abnormal, the food supply was no exception. For example, during the period of October, the committee had purchased 50,000 shi of rice in Jiangxi, which was originally intended to be distributed in Shanghai, but was unexpectedly detained by the Jiangxi Provincial Government and not released, which affected the grain source for Shanghai's October rationing. In November, the committee's supply of rationed grain to Shanghai, based on the number of households, should be 526,776 shi. In addition to the approximately 200,000 shi already delivered to the Shanghai People's Livelihood Association, the committee is urging the contracted banks to deliver the remaining 320,000 shi on time, in order to supply the Shanghai People's Livelihood Association for distribution by the 25th of this month. In addition, in order to compensate for the insufficient purchasing power of the national banks, the committee directly entrusted grain merchants to purchase, hoping to smooth the flow of grain sources.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Purchase Funds for Cotton are Insufficient: Decision to Increase Capital by 200 Million Yuan Again; 500,000 Dan of National Cotton to be Collected by the End of this Month <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee held a routine meeting at the Central Bank yesterday. As a result of the discussion, it was considered that the existing purchase funds for cotton were insufficient for turnover. It was decided that the National Bank and the Textile Construction Company would increase their capital by 200 million yuan. It is heard that the already paid funds are more than 200 million yuan, totaling more than 400 million yuan. Up to now, private spinning mills have almost all withdrawn from the joint purchase. Therefore, the actual purchase funds are borne equally by the National Bank and the Textile Construction Company.</p>
<p>Another important resolution passed yesterday decided to collect 500,000 dan of national cotton by the end of this month. Up to now, a total of 210,000 dan of national cotton have been collected. The cotton collected is mostly from Hankou, accounting for about 50,000 dan. Shanghai vicinity, Xi'an, Nantong, Zhejiang, Shashi and other places are next, ranging from 30,000 dan to 10,000 dan.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Cotton Yarn Prices Mostly Increased with Few Decreases; Cloth Market Slightly Firm; Sichuan and Guangdong Customer Sales Were Brisk <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was stable, and the rise and fall of each yarn were very small. People's hearts were still quite firm, and the owners' intention to sell was still weak, but new buyers also rarely inquired. Therefore, the supply and demand on the market were balanced, and as a result, the prices of each yarn mostly increased with few decreases.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 13,000 yuan. The trend in the middle was still strong. Around noon, there was slightly more purchasing, and the price rose to 13,500 yuan at the close, an increase of 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot initially opened at 10,800 yuan, the lowest was 10,400 yuan, and closed at 10,600 yuan, a slight decrease of 100 yuan. In addition, the warehouse receipt initially traded outside the 10,000 yuan mark, and the noon close still stood at the previous day's original price of 9,800 yuan.</p>
<p>20-count Celestial Maiden and Jincheng were unchanged. Others such as Golden Pagoda and Red Kuixing showed mixed results. All yarns below 16-count were strong.</p>
<p>The cloth market was slightly firm, and actual sales in Sichuan and Guangdong were brisk. The northern merchants had little interest, and the local New Cloud flower was also active, and as a result, each cloth had a slight increase.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 420 yuan, and the highest price was 421 yuan. At one point, due to excessive selling, the price dropped to 409 yuan. Finally, it returned to 416 yuan at the close, an increase of 6 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Sijunzi serge initially opened at 425 yuan, and the price was shouted up to 430 yuan in the middle of the day. The closing price was 420 yuan, a profit of 7 yuan. In addition, warehouse receipts were traded at 410 yuan. Sijunzi Yuanzhi tribute spot was 435 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was 425 yuan, each about 5 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Also news: It is heard that the unreasonable ratio of US aid cotton to cotton yarn has made the factories feel that the losses are too great to continue. Therefore, they recently held consecutive meetings to discuss appropriate solutions. According to the research results, considering the current yarn prices, the conversion ratio and the originally set weight of cotton should be increased by at least 50%. The factories have submitted a document to the Cotton Spinning Association requesting an increase in processing fees, with one package of 20-count yarn being exchanged for 705 pounds of 7/8 fiber cotton. The US Aid Cotton Group has decided to hold another meeting tomorrow to discuss and make a concrete decision.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the money market was initially tight and then loose. The market dark interest rate for overnight loans once rose to 35 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and then fell back to around 25 yuan to 30 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 7.5 to 9 jiao. Due to the continuous transportation of cash to South China in recent days, the supply of cash codes was insufficient again. Each bank and money house restricted cash withdrawals again, ranging from 300 yuan to 1,000 yuan per household.</p>

The number of applicants was not as enthusiastic as expected, probably due to the turbulence of the overall situation.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Foreign Exchange Certificates Surge <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Foreign exchange transfer certificates have been rising sharply since the stabilization of the situation. The rise was the most rapid yesterday. It initially opened at 42.5 yuan, and then soared.

<p>Yesterday, the rice market in both the north and south cities declined. The prices in the producing areas were still low, and transportation to Shanghai could still be profitable. Therefore, the arrival volume was still booming, and the owners were eager to sell, and the market opened with a decline. The decline in the north city was even greater than in the south city. White japonica rice dropped by 40 yuan, opening at 360 yuan. Thin indica rice dropped by 50 yuan, early rice dropped by more than 60 yuan, and indica rice and glutinous rice all dropped by 30 to 40 yuan. White japonica rice in the south city also traded at 360 yuan, a decrease of 25 yuan. Early rice dropped by 30 yuan. The arrival volume yesterday was 4,720 shi in the south city and 6,433 shi in the north city, totaling 11,153 shi.</p>
<p>Flour: Turned down, because it was heard that rice prices had fallen, and people's hearts were weak. Those looking for goods lacked support, and ultimately saw a decline. There were not many transactions of old car flour. The opening price was 128 yuan. The opening price of Bingchuan flour was 124 yuan, and later it fell to 122.5 yuan at the close. Old car flour fell by 9 yuan, and Bingchuan flour fell by 6.5 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng each saw a decline of 8 yuan. Bran was first tired and then strong. Rural sales were active, and it was uniquely strong at 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The market turned strong. Due to the fact that customers were taking delivery of them, yellow soybeans rose by 10 yuan. There was not much arrival of Pinghu soybeans, and they rose by 10 yuan. There was a scarce supply of selected green beans, and they rose by 5 yuan. Corn uniquely fell by 5 yuan due to the limited appetite of customers. There was slight domestic demand for red sorghum, and the supply and demand were equal, and the prices were neither strong nor weak. Northern sales of mung beans were stagnant, and they were weak and tired. Sesame was stable, and high-quality raw peanuts were strong at 30 to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Declined, affected by the decline in rice prices. Moreover, yesterday, oil mills required payment with promissory notes and cash, resulting in not many deliveries. Most bean oil mills closed at 700 yuan, and later the returned goods were 690 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell from 600 yuan to 580 yuan, each with a decline of 40 yuan. Jilong raw oil fell by 70 yuan, and Xiao Che sesame oil fell by 20 yuan. Bean cake was not taken delivery of by customers, and fell by 5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Sugar Market Saw Mixed Results of Increases and Decreases <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was high and then stuck. People's hearts were still not encouraged. However, due to the easing of the money market, there were still more orders being absorbed, but actual sales were not smooth, and the market still lacked vitality.</p>
<p>No. 45 car white refined sugar in bags was not traded and remained at the original price. Packaging rose slightly by 5 yuan. No. 24 coarse granulated sugar, which had been uniquely weak among the strong, had a smooth absorption yesterday and rose by 15 yuan. Xinghua white and Xinghua red, this factory's white sugar, etc., all rose slightly by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Local sugar hun diao qing fell by 5 yuan. This factory's rock sugar, Zhenji rock sugar slices, had a strong momentum the previous day, but were weak and tired. There were continuous sales on the market yesterday, and the local demand was also minimal. Market prices still plummeted, falling by 20 to 40 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Tung Oil Steadily Firm <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Amid adjustments in water and land freight rates, the tung oil market hovered in place. Although the sellers' desire to raise prices was unabated, actual sales were limited and the buying sentiment was hesitant, preventing further development. Foot-grade self-refined oil was 600 yuan per dan, and genuine Xihong was 550 yuan per barrel. The rest lacked comparison, but the foot-grade was firmer than before.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Tea Market Firm <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Since the shipment of red and green teas has continued to weaken, the price has fallen quite a bit. However, yesterday in the market, those holding goods, considering the cost involved, and also because the required funds had already been settled, again felt reluctant to easily sell them off. The situation turned to show signs of recovery, and prices unanimously showed signs of rising. The underlying tone also took a tortuous turn to become firm. As for transactions, exports of boxed tea were still mostly from export merchants with narrow margins, and not much business was done. However, the demand for domestic fancy teas from this street and other places continued to be good, and the volume of transactions remained decent.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Rescuing the Wuxi Industrial Crisis: Power Shortage, Financial Suffocation, Difficulties in Transportation and Sales; Revealing Six Major Problems, Planning Essential Mutual Assistance Measures <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Wuxi, 6th] Recently, this county has been affected by the current situation. Banks are tightening lending, and factories are not only having difficulty raising cash to pay wages, but also suffering from the inability to circulate capital. Moreover, there is a serious power shortage. The coal reserves of the Qijian Weir Power Plant are only sufficient for half a month, and the coal stored by the Xinsha Factory is only enough for ten days. All factories in the county are facing the crisis of shutdown due to lack of power. In addition, the difficulty in replenishing raw materials and equipment, the fact that finished products are priced far below cost due to falling prices, and the obstruction of transportation, make sales extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Stopping or Reducing Work Easily Leads to Disputes</p>
<p>There are many workers in this county. Once factories stop or reduce work, it is very easy to cause disputes, shorten the life of industry, or affect social security. The Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Association, the County Council of this county, the County Chamber of Commerce, and others, considering the seriousness of the situation, held an emergency symposium at 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th to rescue the industrial crisis. Attendees included Legislators Xue Mingjian and Sun Xiangfeng, National Assembly members Xu Chizi and Ren Shixiong, as well as local community organizations and factory representatives Li Tiping, Zhang Yifei, Sun Deguang, Zheng Xiangde, and Chen Jinli, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Do Not Panic, Correct Things Effectively</p>
<p>First, Hua Jinji, Secretary-General of the Provincial Industrial Association, reported on the six major issues proposed to solve the current industrial crisis. Then, Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, gave a detailed analysis of the current situation, saying that today's situation is a man-made contradictory phenomenon formed under the circumstances of "panicking before there is any real panic." This contradiction has created chaos in transportation. The National Bank has also tightened lending, and rumors of the bank's withdrawal have been circulating. This should be criticized. He strongly stated that everyone should work together to maintain the overall situation.</p>
<p>Six Major Issues, Exchange of Opinions</p>
<p>Then, the six major issues were discussed, and opinions were exchanged one by one. (1) Mutual assistance and cooperation in industrial technology and equipment: it was decided to first classify each industry, elect a committee for each category, form a small group meeting, formulate a mutual assistance and cooperation plan, conduct a detailed review, and then implement it. (2) Remedying the industrial power shortage: it was decided (A) to request the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the two Ministries to jointly form a Coal Adjustment Office responsible for the coal business, and quickly allocate coal to Wuxi to prevent Wuxi industry from shutting down completely due to lack of electricity. (B) Request the Ministry of Social Affairs to quickly negotiate with the relevant ministries and commissions to quickly allocate coal to maintain Wuxi industry. (C) Request the Ministry of National Defense to quickly order the troops near the Weinan Coal Mine to quickly allocate special trains to transport large quantities of coal to enrich industrial power. (3) Industrial financial issues: it was decided (A) to request the county government to convene the heads of the National Bank bureaus in Wuxi for talks, promote cooperation with the local area, and not abandon responsibility at critical moments. (B) If the bureaus of each bank disregard local interests, immediately stop paying taxes and establish a joint bank. (C) Telegraph the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to appeal for emergency industrial loans to be handled quickly. (4) The purchase and sale of industrial raw materials and finished products: because taxes exceeded selling prices, and purchases and sales were particularly difficult, it was decided to hand them over to a small group meeting for discussion. (5) Close cooperation between labor and capital: Xue Mingjian, on behalf of the capital side, appealed to labor and capital to share weal and woe. Director Tang of the General Labor Union stated: as long as the factory is firm in its beliefs and does not shake itself first, the workers will definitely be able to cooperate with the factory to the end. (6) Industry and self-defense: it was decided to reissue national identity cards to protect the rights and safety of workers.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper, Guilin, 2nd] The Hunan-Guizhou Railway has been frequently delayed recently due to the poor maintenance of the roadbed, and accidents have occurred from time to time. According to Ting Jie, director of the Joint Office of the Railway Bureau, the reasons are: (1) poor roadbed, too many bad sleepers; (2) the entire line needs 3,000,000 new sleepers, even if only partially replaced, 1,500,000 sleepers are needed, roughly valued at more than 21,000,000 yuan. The Railway Bureau is unable to raise the money; (3) the coal used is of poor quality. The entire line currently needs more than 13,000 tons of coal per month, sourced from Heshan and Qiyang Dapu and other places. Except for the coal produced in Heshan, which is barely acceptable, the remaining coal contains nearly half sand and soil, which is not suitable for train use; (4) Heavy wheels and car body equipment are mostly made of Thai raw materials, which are not very durable. All the above points urgently need the Railway Bureau to find ways to improve them.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper, Wujin, 6th] There are schools for refugee students from Shandong Province who have moved to Changzhou to resume classes, including Ziyang Normal School, Julu Normal School, Jining Normal School, Qufu Normal School, etc. The total number of students is more than 9,000, scattered in Benniu Xiaxi, Hengshanqiao and other places. They rent houses to set up schools and resume classes. Their general living conditions are very difficult. In particular, some students in Houxu have not yet been able to formally attend classes. Principal Wang of the school often stays in the Nanjing Ministry of Education to ask for money, resulting in frequent food shortages at the school. The young students have no other way to turn to, and some even beg for food door-to-door with tears in their eyes, seeking a full meal. Some female students live in several temples next to the feet of the Bodhisattvas, sleeping on some straw with three or four people sharing a quilt. Hunger and cold have devastated them, making them withered and weak. Some are even bitterly begging to be taken in as maids to get a full meal, which is extremely miserable. The local area has lent dozens of stones of rice, but it is difficult to sustain.</p>

<p>Responsibility for the Murder Still Awaiting Trial</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Changsha, quick dispatch, 4th] In Shitanpu, Quanxi City, Hengyang County, more than 158 refugees from Anhui Province arrived on the 29th of last month and lived in a public ancestral hall nearby. Because they were unable to buy food, they often went to people's homes to extort and rob, which disturbed the residents. The residents reported to the Quanxi City Police Station. After receiving the report, the police station sent police to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the refugees refused to obey and clashed with the police. At that time, there were too few police, and the few were no match for the many. One policeman was slashed with a horse knife by the refugees. Gunshots were fired in the chaos, and Yuan Shaosong, a local resident, was shot and injured. Two police rifles were also snatched by the refugees. According to the refugees, Zhang Haitang, a 17-year-old girl, and Zhang Si, an eight-year-old boy, went missing. Zhao Yulin, a refugee, went out to look for the two children afterwards, but they have not been found. The case is currently being tried by the Hengyang Garrison Department. The refugees insist that the police fired, while the police say that the refugees committed the murder. Whose responsibility it is has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Sound of War Drums at the Battle of Pengcheng <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Qinheng</p>
<p>In the Battle of Xuzhou, the 100th Army of the Army valiantly defeated the stubborn enemy. Commander Zhou Zhidao bravely took the lead, sustaining multiple wounds, and served the country with utmost loyalty, which is deeply admired. I have composed six poems in heptasyllabic verse to console him.</p>
<p>(1) Since ancient times, there has been much war in the Central Plains, and now the red flames are rising again. The arrow of Cheng Qing should be stopped, and the weapon to quell the disturbance should be wielded to turn back the sun. The sounds of apes and cranes follow my tears, and countless lives are lost. Several times after cockcrow, I get up to dance, and I often look up to see what the night holds.</p>
<p>(2) A man values merit and fame in this world, smiling as he embarks on a distant expedition with a Wu hook. The falling leaves and west wind urge the horn, and the evening colors of the turbulent river guide the perilous flags. The stars are sparse, the moon is dim, and the clouds open the formation. The earth is cracked, the sky is collapsing, and lightning sweeps the camp. I will not return until I have slain Loulan, leading my troops to defend the ancient city of Pengcheng.</p>
<p>(3) The general spreads his wings like an eagle, invigorating the spirit of the country, and leaves the military gate with drums beating at dawn. Golden flags cover the field, yellow banners disappear, and iron wings traverse the white sky, darkening it. The autumn sounds from beyond the Great Wall are increasingly severe, and the sword at my waist is still warm with blood. May the enemy's courage be stripped from now on, for one victory is more than enough to show.</p>
<p>(4) I vow to reverse the tide that has already passed, ashamed to pursue Wei Jiang's reckless words of peace. Who sprinkles heroic tears on the battlefield? The setting sun waves with the swords of brave men. The whale drum moves and the bugle plays music, and fiery oxen cross the river, spilling blood. The general has laid out a long snake formation, and he does not tire of the thousands of Hu cavalry!</p>
<p>(5) Who will serve the country as a shield? The sad sounds of the night startle my dreams. The night moon coldly contains the fullness of autumn colors, and the iron armor is chilled by the light of the sword. Falling flowers wash the water, buffalo and sheep face the enemy, and the cries of cranes and the roar of wind fill the grass and trees with soldiers. Why wait for the morning meal? The general sits and listens to the sound of victory!</p>
<p>(6) The full success of the revolution remains to be achieved. How can we allow foxes and rats to destroy our awe-inspiring city? Having gone through a hundred battles, my heart is still strong. My eyes extend to the northern plains, and my spirit has not calmed. I have often learned Sun Tzu's tactics in forming formations, and I have often emerged from the Han camp. After returning from glorious bloody battles, heaven will bless the fortunate and bring the spring of life!</p>

<h3 id="e124">Communism in China, September 1948, Compiled by the American Academy Foreign Relations Committee <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Newspaper Translation Office</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to point out a country that has made significant industrial progress without the prerequisite of stable political power. Only Switzerland and Belgium are exceptions, both of which are special cases resulting from the balance of power among major powers.</p>
<p>For a considerable period to come, China will not be able to rely on its own ability to guarantee against the intrusion of foreign forces. The Soviet Union is currently unable to provide protection to a particular country because they cannot put forward reasonable demands for benefits. The United Nations should clearly provide this security guarantee to all countries, but the United Nations cannot do this until the current conflict of interests between the United States and the Soviet Union is resolved, because any country can use its veto power against the other party's proposed solutions.</p>
<p>Among the countries of the world, only the United States has sufficient political power to provide China with an effective guarantee of territorial and political integrity. The United States has stated for the past fifty years that China's integrity is one of its important interests. It is the only strong country capable of providing this guarantee, and it can even be said that the guarantee is not an instrument of imperialist rule. The United States has clearly demonstrated in the Philippines that the region will ultimately achieve genuine independence, not just a verbal promise, but a promise that can be politically realized. The United States has taken great risks and at a significant cost, showing its unwillingness to interfere in Chinese affairs. Britain's granting of autonomy to India and independence to Burma also demonstrates a similar attitude, but it is powerless to provide China with a complete guarantee. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine solving China's political problems without simultaneously solving domestic and foreign political problems; it is even more difficult to imagine actually solving these problems without the aid of the United States. If the United States wants to resist the evil consequences of Moscow's propaganda, the determination and public announcement of its policies must be very skillful.</p>
<p>To make these solutions effective, China's domestic social problems must also be solved simultaneously. China needs popular education as a foundation for strengthening the modernization of everything from industry to politics. China urgently needs new elements in social life to gradually replace the original mission of the Chinese family in society, a mission that has been frustrated during the war and may not be able to restore its original importance.</p>
<p>These problems also involve administrative issues. China lacks trained and experienced administrators. Its craftsmanship and commercial skills have not reached the administrative efficiency we know. The accounting methods of Chinese merchants are such that he himself can report on the business situation, but an impartial auditor cannot objectively examine or estimate his business situation. Statistical methods cannot be applied in this situation, and without statistics, there can be no economic policy. For example, modern business tax cannot be based on this type of accounting.</p>
<p>This is a matter of ethics and business habits, not something that can be taught in school courses. This problem cannot be solved simply by sending Chinese students to study in the United States or sending American professors to China. It is closely related to the entire economic, political, and moral foundation, and its solution still depends on the solution of basic political problems.</p>
<p>These many partial problems—industrial, economic, political, and other problems—must be solved before the democratic problem is solved. Some people believe that democracy is a simple system that can be established simply by passing a document announcing this doctrine; this is one of the greatest mistakes of modern thought. Therefore, any country that has passed a "democratic" constitution is welcomed as a newborn democracy. However, countries that have not yet done so are denounced as being wrongheaded, malicious, and backward in will.</p>
<p>The spirit of democracy, no matter in which country, cannot be established in less than a generation, and it cannot be established without a good environment. The beginning of democracy is a process of development, not a sudden event. The establishment of British democracy went through a series of reforms, starting in 1832 and lasting a century, based on Parliament and the cabinet system. The emergence of American democracy was not due to the "Declaration of Independence," but due to the gradual development of democracy from the Jefferson era, through the Jackson and Lincoln eras, all the way to the era of women's suffrage. We became a democratic country after a long period of training and torture, and we have not yet reached our ultimate goal. If we expect other countries to become democratic countries in the blink of an eye, we have forgotten many of our lessons. Where we need to proceed arduously, we cannot give China a "magic carpet" to fly into the air.</p>
<p>China needs momentum, industry, and rapid capital accumulation, and it is urgently needed. China is eager to make legislative resolutions, and a dictatorship that can establish such resolutions more quickly than constitutionalism may be attractive.</p>
<p>Will China develop into a democracy? This is a very subtle question. China may, but perhaps it will not. It depends on how assistance is provided to promote conditions conducive to democracy, because the trend in the past decade has been the exact opposite, and China itself does not have the ability to reverse this trend. In terms of urgency, the most important thing is military strength and political stability, followed by the improvement of the economic situation, and thirdly, political democratization.</p>
<p>The general public's disappointment with the Chinese anti-communist army is probably due to the hopelessness of the future of the National Government. It is very difficult for people living outside of China to observe or perceive the existence of unorganized vitality.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this vitality does exist, in a form that is compatible with the local initiative rights in the Three Principles of the People. A recent example is the upsurge of popular spirit in North China. Several astute observers have praised General Fu Zuoyi of Beiping as China's most capable anti-communist leader. He mobilized local people to support his army, thereby strengthening his military power. He implemented moderate land reforms in the recovered areas to resist the Communist Party's land revolution. He trusted the people and armed the villages to defend against the Communist Party. The leftist tendencies of Beiping students have been suppressed, not by the police, but by the direct resistance of angry farmers. Although the National Government has not given him full support, under Fu's leadership, the popular spirit in the North has greatly increased, and the situation of defending the area has also greatly improved. It is becoming clear that the United States cannot write off North China as already lost, and there is even less reason to do so.</p>
<p>Communism has a way of making China's problems impossible to solve with Chinese tools alone. No Chinese army can quickly defeat the CCP's army. The CCP controls the rural areas, without which Chinese agriculture cannot maintain national links. The CCP controls the industrial areas of North China and Northeast China, without which the Chinese economy cannot be electrified and built. If the CCP wins the civil war, it may turn the whole country into a Soviet system. They have a doctrine that advocates using simple methods to solve all problems. The communist method avoids the practical problems of democracy, and for a country that has encountered the development that Western countries needed four centuries to achieve in one century, it seems easier and clearer in many ways than any other method.</p>
<p>Therefore, to solve the China problem, military and economic power are not enough. China is currently unable to mobilize sufficient military force to establish and guarantee domestic security. China will not be able to ensure that it is free from foreign interference in the near future. China cannot be self-sufficient due to a lack of materials, and cannot embark on the path of economic recovery. China cannot independently recruit management and technical personnel to support a comprehensive revitalization plan.</p>
<p>The United States is the only country that can make up for China's lack. In addition, the United States has other international obligations, and it must economize its financial resources so that all obligations are balanced. However, if China is saved, the balance between obligations and financial resources will improve; if China is lost, the balance will worsen.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that Marxism is more applicable to countries in the development stage of Europe in 1850. For so-called backward countries in the 20th century, Marxism is even more suitable than 19th-century Europe. Marxist communism has a simple blueprint for solving all economic, social, and political problems in an undemocratic way. From this point of view, the United States is essentially post-Marxist. This country has passed through the most serious problems caused by modern industrial progress without harming the essence of democratic politics. But the United States has not provided an explanation of how to learn from it for the benefit of other countries. In this regard, China is clearly a proving ground. If pre-Marxist countries can understand how to follow post-Marxist countries without falling into the detour of communism, then the goal of a peaceful and democratic world is not far away. The United States must cooperate with these countries to come up with that method. Providing China with military, economic, and political assistance is an unavoidable means of achieving our goals.</p>
<p>But the greatest need is intellectual cooperation between the United States and China. There are many things that need to be studied. The Communist Party has spent thirty years studying how to directly implement communism in backward countries, how to shorten the development process of capitalism, and the theory and strategy of indefinitely delaying the development of democratic politics. We have also studied and shown how to overcome the major ills of capitalism. But we have not yet reviewed or analyzed or understood our own achievements.</p>
<p>We have accomplished five major economic and political requirements, although they have not yet reached a perfect state, they are still in a state of continuous growth. The first requirement is private property, which is an indispensable foundation for economic personal creativity and personal dignity. The second requirement is the continuous increase in production, far exceeding the extent to which Marxists predicted that capitalism would inevitably become unproductive. The third requirement is the gradual trend of politics towards democratization and the gradual realization of freedom of speech and freedom of voting. The fourth requirement is the maintenance of the majority vote system; without this system, politics will inevitably evolve into a universal vote system. The fifth requirement is respect for the freedom of other nations, as demonstrated in the Philippines.</p>
<p>These principles, although not perfectly realized in the Americas - for perfection in this world, there is no hope - but in its continuous progress, it proves that the predictions of Marxists are wrong, because we have now completed things that Marx and Lenin considered impossible. Although we are still inevitably flawed and need to continue to work hard, we have already passed through fifty years of development, exceeding the erroneous scope set by the prophets of communism. This not only denies Marxism, but also recognizes the possibility of the realization of peace and freedom in human society.</p>
<p>Now, we must thoroughly understand why we do that, so as to give the Chinese people and many other nations a clear demonstration, so that they believe that they can also do that, that they can find a direct and accessible path from the current state to our state, avoiding the historical detours through the disasters of capitalism and imperialism. To win people's confidence, this road must at least be a shortcut that seems as attractive as communism. But the minimum is not the limit. Although this task is still far from completion, it has already begun, and a simpler, more direct, and more promising approach has already emerged. Regardless of whether our fate is war or peace, we must cooperate with China, and may cooperate with China, to seek a modern, democratic, and non-communist path for the nations of the world.
