<h3>為公敎人員呼籲！</h3>
<p>人民對於改革後的新幣制祗有絕對信任。惟有信任，國家纔能得救：也惟有信任，人民本身也纔能得救。不然的話，國家的前途固然不了，而吃苦無窮的還是人民自己。所以，今天我們人民對於經濟緊急措施所頒佈的四項辦法，沒有猶豫徬徨的餘地，應該全部接受而加以切實的擁護。</p>
<p>王財長爲着「接近收支平衡」，除了調整稅收的開源以外，更注重於降低公敎人員待遇的節流：這是値得大家注意的一件事。開源節流原是辦理財政的不二法門，可是開源要開得合理，節流也要節得合理，否則其結果或未能接近，而反致疎遠了。我們爲希望改革方案的認眞執行計，不能不對於此點，爲公敎人員特別提出呼籲！</p>
<p>過去公敎人員待遇之低，已爲人所詬病；工作效率的低落，貪汚舞弊的風行，胥由待遇太低而起。現在要收改革經濟的實效，尤應同時廓淸一般的積弊。因爲辦法無論訂得如何嚴密妥善，若是公務人員連飯都吃不飽，家中子女連書都讀不起，如何能望他們執行得力，如果執行不力，或敷衍了事，或混水摸魚，那徒法就不能以自行了。例如征收捐稅，如果執行得力，使之毫無道漏，杜絕私弊，使之涓滴歸公，則以現行的種種稅捐，再能酌加調整，不但可以接近收支的平衡，或竟能適得其平，或且可以超過戰前的數額。否則征收人員的所得倘不足以養廉，好的不是餓死，就將另謀他職，而任何調整或仍不免於飽了征收人員的私囊，好了奸商們上下其手，苦了老百姓橫遭剝削，而終於救不了國庫的空虛，管子所說「衣食足而後知榮辱」，眞是千古不磨的定論。要公敎人員奉公守法，恐怕不是單靠重整道德運動所能奏效的吧。</p>
<p>照整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法第十九條規定：「文武公敎人員之待遇，一律以金圓券支給，其標準以原薪額四十元爲基數，實發金圓券，超過四十元至三百元之部份，按十分之二發給金圓券，超過三百元之部份，一律按十分之一發給金圓券：士兵薪餉副食，悉按戰前甚數實發金圓券，槪不折扣。」同辦法第三條：「國營公用及交通事業之收費低於戰前標準者，准參照戰前標準調整之。……」第十三條：「全國各地各種物品及勞務價格，應照民國三十七年八月十九日各該地各種物品估價，依兌換率折合金圓出售，由當地主管官署嚴格監督執行。」我們把這三條分析和歸納一下，深恐公敎人員今後將實在處於不能維持生活的境地了！</p>
<p>八月十九日那一天的法幣物價折合金圓物價，白粳要比戰前漲上一倍，龍頭細布，猪肉，食油，肥皂等日用品也都漲過三倍有餘，白報紙則竟漲過六倍（見八月二十二日商報之物價折合金圓比較表）。如果公用和交通事業的收費都陸續依照戰前的標準調整，至少也將漲起一倍。假使公敎人員的薪給以戰前爲標準，那就是依照士兵薪餉不折不扣地以金圓券發給，已經要使公敎人員挑起比戰前加倍或加一倍以上的負担。若再把他們的薪給用累進制折扣起來，就要使他們减少一半至四分之三的收入，一方面旣要减少收入，而减又减得如此之多，一方面又要增加支出，而增又增得如此之鉅，如果他們沒有別的方法可以調劑的話，一般公敎人員就袛得枵腹從公，更談不到仰事俯蓄了。以如此重要的行政大事，交由如此待遇的公敎人員去負責推行，我們可以希望他們能出多大的力？固然，我們希望有一二聖賢者出，安貧樂道，奉公守法，宵旰憂勤，爲民服務，但又豈能責望於人人？自新的經濟措施頒佈施行以後，我們不但希望王財長從此能够接近牧支平衡，而且要求王財長更進一步把收支趨於平衡。因爲新幣制成功的重要關鍵就繫於國家收支的平衡。我們要求平衡收支，當然同情於王財長的節流原則，但是對於公敎人員如此節流，為了整個的政治效率與政治風紀着想，實在不敢茍同。其實現在多的是駢枝機關和各機關的冗員，倘然把兩個或三個機關痛痛快快的併成一個，再把二人或三人分做的事完全交由一人承辦，再把節省下來的經費，分給實在有事可做的機關和確在努力做事的人員，那王財長的節流的原則還不是一樣可以做到嗎？我們講求行政效率，還是事半功倍好呢？還是事倍功半好呢？旣要馬兒好，又要馬兒不吃草，恐怕天下沒有這樣違反自然原則的便宜事，何况公敎人員究竟是人呀！</p>
<p>我們絕對愛護國家，我們竭誠擁護政府，所以我們愛護政府所頒佈的經濟改革辦法，而不忍聽其夭折於食不飽力不足的公務人員之手。我們要經濟革新辦法的成功，就得愛護身負執行重任的王則長：我們要王財長對於經濟改革辦法順利進行，就得愛護爲國爲民執行公務的公敎人員。我們爲了愛護公務人員，對於現在規定的待遇就得替公敎人員作懇切的呼籲！凡是有心人，當不致以這個呼籲爲廢話吧！</p>

<p>（二）陳總司令覆胡校長函：適之先生：收到先生廿三日的信，關於特種刑庭傳拘學生的事，治安機關有協助執行的責任。先生負責保證貴校被拘傳的除到案的以外，已無一人，我們當然相信。並據憲警負責人報吿，他們已進校看過調査的結果，與先生調査的一樣。我們希望凡確知不在北平的學生，請學校方面轉知他們，從速到當地法庭投案，否則也一樣開除學籍。如果他們或他們的同黨再在學校活動，負有司法警察任務的憲警，將根據職權隨時到學校逮捕。這是該先向先生聲明的。敬祝健康！陳繼承敬上廿四日」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：據消息靈通之白宮方面人士稱，史達林在廿四日會議中會提出某種「新見解」，使柏林僵局有打開之希望。關於「新見解」之性質若何並未透露，但此一新發展已將柏林會談將告破裂之疑懼消除盡凈。同時莫斯科會議之延長，至少可暫時避免國際嚴重局勢之爆發。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿四日電〕三强使節與史達林之會談散會後，英專使羅伯茲告新聞記者曰「吾人頃與史達林元帥會談四小時四十分之久，已獲良好之進步，今後尙將作一次會談」。惟躍氏未透露下次會談之日期。昨夜史達林於九時正（莫斯科時間）在克林姆宮接見三國使節，繼即開始商談，至今日上午一時四十分始已。今日英專使首先對莫斯科談判進行情形作確切之聲明，因以消除莫斯科談判開始約三星期以來之迷霧與一般悲觀。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿四日電〕據悉：史達林元帥在廿三日晚至廿四日淸晨之五小時會議中，已排除障碍，使關於德國問題之一連串新談判，能賡續舉行。美大使史密斯於上午一時四十五分　克林姆宮，渠指出史達林已親自打破德國問題之死結，使談判能繼續楚行，但渠拒絕洩漏在此四小時又四十五分之談話中，究竟已產生何種結果。全部談話之報吿正送往華盛頓倫敦及巴黎。觀察家認爲與莫洛托夫外長之新談判，可能在週末以前舉行，史達林或亦可能參加。廿三日晚與史莫之會談，顯係西方使節所請求者，蓋渠等已明知單與莫洛托夫之會談，已臨絕境。此間一般相信，僅有史達林能打破死結，而且認爲此種希望並不太大。就在與史達林晤談以前，英國大使館內確已舉行對羅伯茲特使的臨別鷄尾酒會。史達林究已作何種讓步而使談判得已繼續，則尙無所知。但一般早已知悉，西方專使已拒絕在柏林封鎖依然存在之前，考慮任何對德談判。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿四日電〕權威方面廿四日表示：目前莫斯科談判中關於解除柏林對鎖遲遲未能解決而遭僵特之　結，在柏林幣制問題。此一問題之背後，乃爲西方强國留駐柏林及具有平等發言極之更廣泛問題。西方强國準備接受東德蘇聯貨幣作爲柏林之貨幣，但彼等堅持此項貨幣須在柏林內受四强共同管理而不由蘇聯單獨管理。</p>
<h3>美非正式對蘇方建議　邊境駐軍各向後撤　俾緩和柏林現有緊張局面</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿四日電〕美軍事當局二十四日非正式同蘇方建議四强軍隊自柏林各區邊界綫後撤，以緩和東區與西區間之緊張局面。</p>
<p>此項建議，係由美方低級官員交與蘇方低級官員者，該函諒已送交柏林蘇軍司令柯蒂哥夫少將，並經由高級美軍當局認可。根據上項建議，三區之德國警察，將被准不在佔領國憲兵之監督及協助下，巡邏邊界地區。據消息最靈通人士稱，如能獲得有利之答覆，則將正式成立協議。同時，由於蘇關之妥協姿態，英方亦將蘇聯控制之柏林電台高級蘇方職員萊比特夫釋放，渠係於廿三日因進入英區而被捕。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿三日電〕蘇聯當員廿三日釋放美人三名，英人一名及德人五名，後蘇軍立即在美佔區捕去德籍攝影員一人，稍後不久，萊比特夫即在英佔區以駕駛過速被捕。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿四日電〕因蘇軍在波次坦普廣塲架人而引起之緊張局勞，今日顯已緩和。蘇軍雖又於二十三日晚越界，但美方稱係偶然之事。據美方消息，蘇聯巡邏隊員若干人，在彼茨坦普廣塲南之恩哈拖軍站附近進入美區，但未干涉任何人，離開時亦未逮捕任何人。一般認為渠等之越界係由於未能覺察。</p>
<h3>西德憲草完成</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法蘭克福廿三日電〕西德十一邦總理所委任之起草委會，現已完成西德政府之憲草。據稱：憲草中規定由普選產生中天議會，其中包括西德各邦代表四百人，以及柏林代表廿人，此外另由邦政府代表產生參議院。政府之執行機稱共分十部，設部長會議主席一人，行憲及行政事務由各邦政府負責，而外交運輸與交通則由中央政府負責。</p>
<h3>柏林市選舉　蘇下令明秋舉行</h3>
<p>西方佔區將有所聲明</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿四日電〕蘇聯佔領軍司令索柯洛夫斯基今日下令將柏林秋季選舉延遲一年。觀察家立即解釋渠之行動，係承認蘇方之地位已因柏林封鎖而削弱。索帥發表文吿　，由於勞工團體及各黨領袖之屢次請求，選舉將延至一九四九年秋季舉行。索帥之片面決定，對四方三佔區將無効力，一般預料西方國家可能對蘇聯之決定有所聲明。柏林秋季選舉早已成爲政治爭端中之焦點，自共黨控制之社會統一黨在一九四六年秋獲得百分之二十選票後，此係柏林市選之第一次。主要三反共政黨已向市議會提出一項共同提議，要求選舉按期於十月廿四日舉行，市議會並預定於廿六日之大會中加以討論。</p>
<h3>芬共黨領袖　前往莫斯科</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕莫斯科電台今晚傳播芬共爭權之宣主，內稱，芬人民應在共黨領導下爲國家之主人，共黨爲達此目的計，現正動員民主陣綫所有之全力，以便根據經濟興國家獨立建樹人民民主國。</p>

<h3>美準以軍火　運往馬來亞</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三十日電分官方今宣稱，國務部葉已批准軍火運往馬來亞，以協助殲滅意圖威脅橡膠農塲之共匪。據稱，此項軍火主要爲警用露　　，包括各種自動武器，送與美國當地業主作爲自衛之用。外交官員稱，美國已深切明瞭馬來　共匪叛亂之嚴重性。</p>
<h3>美駐韓軍政府宣布結束　美佔領軍不撤退　霍奇返美後繆錫俄任最高代表</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國頃正式宣布結束其在韓之軍事佔領，霍奇中將以其職務移交等，大使銜代表繆錫俄。自李承晚於八月十五日成爲韓國總統，美國承認韓國以來，衆信美國必有此措置。繆錫俄將受美駐韓高級代表銜。此即表示三年來軍事佔領形態之政府從此結束，惟並不謂美國軍隊將全部撤退。彼等仍將留駐韓國，協助新政府。</p>
<p>前美駐韓軍副司令古爾特將繼任霍奇之職位。霍奇之新任職令尙未發表。已奉令先至華盛頓陸軍總部報吿杜魯門總統致函霍奇稱，「南韓政府之成立，已結束閣下之艱鉅任務。韓國政權業已移交其本國人民，定能使閣下滿意，同時我國政府亦甚爲滿意」。陸軍部長羅雅爾與參謀總長勃雷特萊亦向霍奇致賀。霍奇除曾於去年一度回國外，六年來始終居於外國，自對日戰爭結束以來，霍氏即在韓國。國務部宣布，繆錫俄之任務，將爲談判訓練韓國新兵，移交佔領軍財產予韓國政府，並移轉前日本財產予韓國。使韓國在警察組織以外，再建立新軍，亦將在聯合國建立安全軍力之計劃以內。國務都及陸軍部官員，均坦白表示，在美韓兩國認爲美佔領軍可對抗北韓之蘇聯訓練的軍隊時，美軍仍將留駐韓國。按蘇聯訓練的北韓軍隊約有十二萬五千人，南韓警察估計有二萬六千人。美軍之非正式估計數約爲二萬三千人。此外，繆錫俄須負責將前佔領費併合經濟合作總署。國務部宣佈，繆氏將與李承晚進行雙邊協定之談判，使援韓計劃歸入援華計劃之中。援韓基金即為國會撥予陸軍部之未動用的佔領費，總數約爲一億美元。繆錫俄接手之問題，尙有與北韓蘇軍司令茂古洛夫之電力科紛事。韓國政府雖亦將參與其事，然繆氏將予以協助。</p>
<h3>警察及海防隊　美移交韓政府</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿四日電〕韓總統李承晚及美軍總司令霍奇，今簽訂臨時協定，規定韓國所有安全部隊，包括警察及海岸防衛隊之　　　及指　　，應按韓境美韓部隊之共同安全，儘速逐步移交韓國政府。此爲關於美軍當局向韓政府移交主權事項下各項協定中之第一項。是項協定疲在美軍撤退以前暫時有效。</p>
<h3>史密斯報告送達華府　美當局在研究中　英專使羅伯茲將返倫敦</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日提早到達辦公室，研究來自莫斯科之關於廿三日晚會談情形之極度秘密報吿。國務部官員稱，史密斯大使之報吿係於晚間接得，但對內容則守口如瓶。杜魯門總統則可望於日間獲得該項會談之報吿。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿四日電〕英外部發言人公認草斯科會談將繼續，幷確切說明羅伯茲專使回返倫敦乃毫無問題。廿三日晚會議之官方消息尙未獲悉，但權威方而重申美駐蘇大使史密斯對莫斯科之聲明稱，更多之會議諒將舉行，彼等稱此誠佳訊。</p>

<h3>美對德國事件的失着</h3>
<p>— 章石譯</p>
<p>下面所述的，是一篇關於美國怎樣放棄其在德國的軍事上之有利點的文字。原文載七月廿三日之「美國新聞與世界報吿」雜誌。</p>
<p>當第二次大戰將結束的時候，美國進攻德國的氣勢很盛，要進佔柏林並不是一件難事，但是美國爲了尊軍條約，並不進攻柏林。當時，美軍的勢力深入捷克，其佔領的範圍，加上英法雨盟軍的佔領地區，是比目前的西德大得多。結果，美國爲了遵守條約，把多佔的地方悉數交與了蘇聯。雖然柏林仍爲聯軍佔領，可是這也就造成了今日柏林問題和德國問題的前因。</p>
<p>蘇聯在柏林對美·英·法三方的要挾，這是由於當時放棄有利地位所形成的。事實是這樣，假使在第二次大戰時，沒有戰時條約的規定，美軍是早就可以佔據柏林了。因爲有戰時條約的規定，柏林只得留下來讓蘇聯攻城。同時，一大半美國軍隊所佔領的德國領土，也做了美軍進據柏林的代價，讓予蘇聯。</p>
<p>當蘇聯允許英美聯軍可以進入柏林的時候，雙方是沒有明文規定西方可以無限制進出柏林的，所以蘇聯由於領土方面和權力方面的便利，才能够有今日封鎖西方對柏林的運輸道孔之勢力。駐德美軍總司令克萊將軍曾經從事關於德國問題的協商，可是協商的結果，是助長了蘇聯對於鐵幕的布置，和管制對柏林供應通道的勢力。　大戰結束後，美國的所以放棄原有在德國之有利點，乃是完全出於自願的，下面就是所發生的事實。</p>
<p>在一九四五年，美國軍隊當到臨柏林城下，就停止了進攻，這乃是出於美國遵守條約的本願，當一九四五年四月中旬，美軍沿易北河到達了曼特堡，這地方離柏林城只有五十哩之遙。他們並且還建立了橋頭堡，準備渡河。美軍的司令官也知道，由此進攻柏林是比較便當，同時德軍和柏林的人民也都希望西方軍隊能首先攻城，因爲他們的觀念。以爲西方軍隊總比較蘇羅軍隊和善些。有着這樣的優勢，但是美軍前進部隊却始終留駐在易北河流域，沒有向前進攻。</p>
<p>馬歇爾將軍，那時是美軍的參謀總長，他曾經向美國軍部這樣地報吿稱：「易北河是與蘇聯約定的美國進軍極限。」的確，像這種的規定是很好的，這　以避免西方軍隊和蘇聯軍隊相逢時的混亂。美軍等了好久，蘇聯軍隊才趕到，包圍柏林，當它撲滅了最後一陣的抵抗時，那已經是五月一日了。美軍是足足地等了它二個多星期。</p>
<p>其他地方，在軍事條約之下，蘇聯允許美國軍隊進駐的地方是只有塞林奇亞和薩克遜尼兩處，所以廣大的地區，全在蘇聯軍隊的掌握之中。關於蘇軍佔領區的問題，即是在一九四四年九月十二日之倫敦會議和後來召開的雅爾達會議，在羅斯福總統史達林元首和邱吉爾首相的磋商下，早有所規定的。</p>
<p>在第二次大戰開始的時候，德國曾經進據捷克，後來美軍爲了避免使蔭地特蘭區的波希米亞山脈一帶，變成德國人抵抗聯軍的「內部堡壘」，於是美軍曾在該區掃蕩。當五月六日美軍在離開捷克京城普拉格只有五十哩的地方，又停止進軍，後來蘇聯軍隊遲遲地攻克了普拉格並且還大大地吹噓過一番，說是：「解放」了捷克。奧地利方面，美軍也曾進攻，直等到五月六日那天德軍駐奧司令向美國第六軍投降，才停止進攻。</p>
<p>當德國失敗之後，美國爲了急於想在該年七月召開之杜魯門總統史達林元首和邱吉爾首相出席的波茨坦會議上獲一結論，就放棄了其在柏林可爭的權利。蘇聯軍隊進駐柏林之後，爲了要擴大其佔領地區域，便允許美英法三國進據柏林，把柏林分成英美法蘇四佔領區。美軍祗得到了柏林的佔領權，却把自捷克邊境到維特勃奇的三百哩地方，依約交予了蘇聯軍隊。英國軍隊也把自維特勃奇到波羅的海的地方，依約交予了蘇聯軍隊。那時，四方列强是準以爲他們可以與柏林佔領區有正常的交通權益的。</p>
<p>在一九四五年六月十四日，社魯門總統首先照會史達林，他首先提議，如果在德國的軍事司令們有關於柏林麥通上的圓滿條約議定，那未不美國軍隊就可以立即退駐原定的佔領區，那時候史達林是答允了社魯門的提議。</p>
<p>六月中旬，蘇聯的駐德司令巨哥夫在柏林的蘇聯司令部招待美國和英國的代表團，那時美國代表團主席就是克萊將軍和國務院方面代表墨飛。美英代表提議西方和柏林當有各項交通上的便利，但遭巨哥夫拒絕。蘇聯方面只建議實行先前的條約，令四國軍事司令在各佔領區內，各有其至上的權利而已。</p>
<p>關於柏林的基本條約，那只有克萊將軍和西方各代表團所接受的對柏林之交通「走廊」這一件。這條約的訂定期是在一九四五年六月二十九日，結果是西方對柏林的水陸交通管制權，仍留在蘇聯的手裏。美國所建議的自由進出一事，僅僅獲得了蘇方的口頭允許，未有明文規定，當時美英便退出了原定的蘇方佔區，同時西方列强軍隊進駐了柏林城。</p>
<p>不料目前所遭遇的，竟是柏林與西方交通的糾紛。英·美·法三方是希望蘇聯能解放其對柏林交通的封鎖，但是蘇聯方面却並沒有允許西方和柏林交通自由的文書給過西方列强。所以看上去，除非英·美·法三方能向蘇聯讓步，否則蘇聯是不可能會放鬆其迫使英·美·法退出柏林之壓力的。</p>
<h3>聖地醞釀新戰爭　猶方稱阿軍已集中聖地邊境　阿聯軍伊拉克軍決統一指揮</h3>
<p>〔合衆社台拉維夫廿四日電〕以色列軍事發言人廿四日譴責阿拉伯正在外約但境內進行新戰爭準備，同時，阿拉伯聯軍及伊拉克軍已宣稱在統一之指揮下合併。據外約但京城阿曼發出之通吿，阿勃杜拉王之阿拉伯聯軍及伊拉克軍已在廿二日同意統一指揮，此次談判進行已有數日，上項協定則在　宮內簽字，阿勃杜拉王並規自主持該項會議。阿拉伯聯軍係中東最大之軍隊，其給養則有賴於英國對外約但之八百萬美元之贈款，聯軍司令葛羅勃中將現正在英國討論本年之贈款事宜。以色列政府稱：渠於上週接獲報蘇，郭克基已辭去「解放巴勒斯坦人民軍」司令職務，該軍包括全世界各地阿拉伯之志願軍，由　利亞及伊拉克統率，現正在巴　斯坦作戰。此間以色列軍事發善人稱：相當程度之戰爭準備，正在離巴勒斯坦邊境數英哩之伊拉克外阿但聯合基地麻勿雷克進行。據稱：在過去一星期間，軍隊及車輛已向該地集中，過去數日間，阿拉伯非正規軍，佐以伊拉克之大砲，並向台拉維夫東數英哩之雷以恩區轟擊，但以色列軍並未還擊。據其他方面消息：以色列軍曾轟擊的雷齊維南之塔以雷達拉，阿拉伯聯軍則轟擊基塞爾之猶太居民區</p>

<h3>上海監三犯越獄　金磚案主角脫逃　鋸斷鐵欄雨中相率遠颺　前年被捕时之陳元盛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海監獄於昨晨一時許，一脫重要盜竊犯三名，其中一人，即爲前年判處無期徒刑之中央銀行金磚案主角陳元盛，其餘兩盜犯，一名姜吉祥，一名王海良，前者處徒刑七年，後者處徒刑四年。比至發覺，早已逃逸無踪。事後檢獲鋼鋸二把，老虎箝一把，錘　一把，及鉛絲一根，證明預謀逃獄，蓄意已久。</p>
<p>上述三犯在越獄以前，皆曾派在監獄醫院口爲雜役，且同睡於五棋西南角一室中。此外同居一室者尙有盜犯劉阿六一名，因判刑四年，行將滿期，不願冒此風險，留而未去。　査該獄五樓囚室，外有平合欄杆，每逢開放，囚犯恒在此作爲晒置被褥及盥洗之用，因此彼等每晨利用毛毯晒置欄杆之便，暗中以鋼鋸將其中鐵欄一根逐漸鋸斷，同時並逐日將醫院之紗布統帶零星偸盜保留，製成繩棠廿四根，再分將十二根拼而爲一，製成粗索兩條，各長十三尺。迨一切準備完成，三犯遂乘昨晨天色灰暗，陣雨驟降之際，開始行動，更偵知東南角守望棋中悄無一人，乃陸續自鋸斷欄杆之空隙中，沿漏水管猿猱而下，旣抵底層，守望樓門窗緊閉，復以鋼鋸將鐵搭攀鋸斷後，跳窗而入，重行步至二樓，而由一並無鐵欄設備之窗戶中，繫以紗布絞成之組索，先後爬至監獄外之廣塲上，該處亦即每次執行槍決盜犯之刑塲也。此後復越過矮牆，折入昆明路逃逸無踪。</p>
<p>比至三時許，始有警衛課課員孔祥裕前往査監，發覺此事，遂報吿課長，星夜轉報軍警機關，一體査緝中。</p>
<h3>八一九物價今公布　社局召開討論會　勸各業自動抑價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自幣制改革後，一般物價均頗平穩，惟蔬菜鮮肉等日常食用物品，仍有波動。社會局爲貫澈中央命令，物價不得超過八一九之價格，昨日上午十時召開物價檢討會，由吳局長親自主持。出席者有經濟行政處長顧炳元，物價管理科長張處德，警察局程義寬，衛生局凌叙猷·王震寰，及水菓地貨·百貨·環球百貨·牛羊·鮮猪·鷄鴨·魚·蔬菜·醬油各業負責人。當經吳局長宣示中央此次以最大決心抑平物價，命令社會。警察。財政。衛生匹局，共同執行，囑各該業即日起自動將抬高之價格降低，一律照八月十九日物價折合金圓券。社局定今日在各市塲公佈各項物價之標準，逾限即予嚴厲處罰。情節重大者，並移送特種刑庭嚴辦。</p>

<p>昨日會中，據宰豬業代表報告，十九日市場批發價格爲每斤一八〇萬至一九〇萬元，目前爲一九〇萬元至二一〇萬元，至零售價格有逾三百萬元者，則應由零售商負責。惟該代表報吿畢，社局張科長指出十九日之批發價並非一九〇萬元，僅一四〇萬元，財政局代表亦證明該局係按一六〇萬元收稅，故十九日之市價一九〇萬元，已有問題。而零售商抬價至三百萬元，更屬非法利潤，社局對此至爲注意。</p>
<p>社會局定於明日上午召集冰鮮·鮮魚·海參運銷各業及攤販聯誼會等負責人，對於物價問題有所指示。</p>
<p>又訊：魚市塲昨派員出席社會局檢討物價會議後，決定通吿魚業有關方面，務必切實遵照政府規定，所有魚貨出售，一律不得超過八月十九日價格，並將是日該塲各種魚類成交價格，分別查明列表公吿，一體遵照辦理。</p>

<p>在江蘇六十三縣市及一個設治局當中，屬於蘇北的，就有三十八縣市，就政治觀點，軍事價値，地理形勢，各方面說，其重要又實不言可喻，何况這廣大地區的食鹽，棉花，小麥，稻穀，高梁，玉蜀黍，牲畜，家禽，水產，各種產量，如不受天災匪禍的影饗，其時値應在五億美元以上，所以共匪在抗戰軍興以後，就滲入這足可孕育百萬兵員的肥美地區，死也不肯放棄，現在就時間言，共匪在蘇北盤踞的歷史，已經在十年以上，不可謂短，就空間言，這廣大肥沃的土地，除去若干重要點綫已爲國軍收復外，那廣大肥沃土地的面，多半還在殘匪土共的魔掌裏，日趨荒蕪，這嚴重的情勢，軍事當局及政府，都知之甚棯，所以除去陸總在徐州設有司令部外，並且在南通，淮陰，各設一綏靖區司令部，分區淸剿，以專賣成。此外，在泰縣·江都·東海·三地，也都置有重兵，設有指揮機構，以便指揮策應，予匪打擊。過去軍事部署，其周密有如此，所謂蘇北的五大州，（徐，海，淮，揚，通）應該是安如磐石，蘇北廣大土地上的妖氛，也應該早日廓淸，恢復過去的繁榮了，但是，事情的發展，每不如理想這樣簡單，拉了兩年的鋸，結果，還須重新劃併，成一個綏靖區，來統一軍事淸剿的指揮權，以便展開全面綏靖工作，完成剿匪的大任，衆信這確是節省人力，財力物力，適宜於實施總體戰的聰明辦法。今後國軍不但可以切實掌握蘇北各地重要的點綫，而因軍事安定的威力加强，可能使面的掃蕩工作，早日展開，不過就目前匪情而論，如果能在短期內，再增調兩個加强師，和四五個機動勇敢的突擊國，到蘇北去，則殘匪土共必然會在這統一指揮的賢明決策下，由垮而滅。目前地方團隊與自衛武力的加強，鄕鎭保甲防諜肅奸的工作，尤其要緊，因爲國軍不能縣縣設防，村村留守，國軍打垮了殘匪，掃蕩了土共以後，那肅淸殘孽，根絕禍種的綏靖重任，必然要地方政府負担起來。大家除希望增調勁旅外，更盼望政府設法鼓勵有錢有爲的善良人士回鄕組訓自衛武力，協助國軍展開面的掃蕩工作，鼓勵的方法：不外（一）切實保障此輩有錢有爲善良人士的財產的安全，勿任意視爲榨取攤派對象，俾使其安心自衛衛鄕的工作。（二）給予此輩人士的子弟，以較優的讀書機會，以滿足其衛國·衛鄕·衛家的三種心願。此外，倘能對於綏區縣長以及區鄕鎭保長的人選，如能因地制宜，因人制宜，因時制宜，善爲安排，不事敷衍，那就更好，總之爲了便於打匪，用人用錢的方法，都要變，而且要變得更合適。</p>
<p>紛傳省府改組說　希望變法重變人</p>
<p>在黨務軍事財政經濟連續革新聲中，近週以來，又不斷傳出了江蘇省府改組的新消息，無疑的，這苦難的江蘇，即將把舊的變成新的，壞的變成好的了。若說王去丁來，不僅那位久經宦海升沉，日趨開明，很想做好，而又苦於力不從心的王　功主席聽之淡然，（請參閱本報鎭江廿三日電）就是敏惑而又長於議論的江蘇人視之，也覺得事屬平常，因爲總統就任後，內閣尙且改組，何况這一省的政府呢。有人說，這回一定改組，新主應是丁治磐將軍，新的秘書長是王公嶼，新的省委兼任廳處長的，有汪寳瑄（建），有葛建時（民），有顧竹洪（財），徐全（社處），還有人說，兪濟民會同來，半踐初亦將應邀，同時也有人說，這回恐怕也和上回一樣，說說而已，不會改組的，其實這都是猜猜看，猜得着固佳，猜不着也不會淡出烏來，反正與猜的人是沒有多大關係的。於此時也，較深刻的說法，是：現省府正在加緊實施戡亂施政綱領，並且推了大員率領督導團三組，冒暑分往各縣督導考核，工作非常認眞，中央或許會給予現省府一個最後的努力機會，以觀後效。其實，這說法也不過說說而已，不過時至今日，中國各省開明的當政的與老百姓，都希望戡亂早日成功，使大家得好好的過日子，要達到這一個目的，上自中央，下至地方，都要時時新，刻刻變，變出好辦法來，以减少人民的痛苦，舊人用舊辦法，固然不行，新人用舊辦法，那就是開倒車，最好的辦法，是用新八行新政，樹立新政風。</p>

<h3>新焦支綫　搶修工程　踏勘記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報修武十六日航訊〕鐵路與煤分不了家，平漢綫新鄭段在惡劣的環境中維持着通車，第一個問題就是煤。</p>
<p>記者由新鄉赴修武的那犬，新鄉站還存十噸煤，只够第二天由新鄉駛往鄭州的一列客車使用，第三天的煤只有等待鄭州運來，可是鄭州又有多少呢？爲了解決這個問題，新焦支綫才於礎商半年後，於七月廿九日開工搶修。</p>
<p>搶修計劃</p>
<p>係首先由焦作中福煤礦公司提出，自從去年新焦綫被破壞後，沁河又爲共匪掘堤潰決，公路交通也告斷絕，焦作成爲孤島。一年多來，礦方始終在窮困交迫中支撑，爲了使這一個國內有數的煤礦不致停頓，自非有賴於交通的恢復不可。可是公司的提議搶修，幷不完全是爲了礦方本身着想，焦作的大炭才一千八百萬一噸，而新鄉已經賣到兩億，在這種不正常的狀態下，新鄉和鄭次的老百姓早已呌苦了。</p>
<p>新鄉以西有二十餘公里沒有破壞，就湑剩下的不到四十公里所需的材料，已經費了一番張羅。</p>
<p>枕木要六萬根，這在路局簡直是一種不可能接受的負擔。天下事窮則變，變則通，在沒有辦法中</p>
<p>想出辦法</p>
<p>這辦法是由四區專員公署分飭博愛，修武，武陟，新鄕，汲縣等縣政府向民間征借枕木。新焦綫修通後，由中福煤礦公司以產煤交由平漢路免費轉蓮新鄕，鄭州，開封等地出售，公司只取廠價所得利潤，償還木款。枕木每根的訂價是二百四十萬元。枕木問題解決後，其餘材料便沒有什麼困難，鐵軌可以七拼八凑地使用，道釘自己可以做，夾板呢，用輕便軌鋸下來權且代替，好在非常時期只有非常應付，浙贛路局局長說得好：「先求其通，後求其備。」現在鐵路本身還有什麽問題更重要於通　？</p>
<p>記者由新鄕登材料車赴搶修的地方！獅子營，搭車赴該處轉往修武焦作的人很多，路方開始售票，票價是十六萬。査票員帶着四個路警，很認眞地執行工作。而這一列車所收入的票價，一共才六百萬元，他們說：「軍人太多。」</p>

<h3>梨香瓜美山河壯　「瓜果城」果園一瞥</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州十七日航訊〕「大理是中國的花園，蘭州是中國的菓園」。美國第三黨領盜人及今年總統候選人亨利華萊士，數年前聘華途經蘭州的時候，也曾給蘭州加上「瓜菓城」的榮冕。于院長（右任）在他的「西北紀行」詩卷裏，對於瓜菓的愛好，描寫得淋漓盡致，隨便摘取兩句：「梨香瓜美山河壯」，「冰天雪地軟兒香」，已够使人神往了。</p>
<p>蘭州的瓜，在全國說來，品種最爲繁多，除一般甜瓜，黃瓜，絲瓜，胡瓜，南瓜，冬瓜，番瓜等應有盡有外，所產的西瓜與醉瓜，華萊士瓜，尤負盛名。</p>
<p>每個西瓜重四十斤</p>
<p>西瓜個大味甜，普通一個能有三·四十斤重，每年六月到九月爲瓜季，但如窖藏得宜，嚴冬還有大啖的機會，所以有「抱着火爐吃西瓜」的諺語。西瓜的品種以皮色分，有白皮，黑皮，花皮三種。以瓜瓤分，有黃瓤，紅瓤兩種。除了變種之外，白皮，黑皮大都爲黃瓤，花皮大都是紅瓤。西瓜多種在蘭州黃河上游兩岸的砂田裏，每年春初下種，每埫地（約二市畝半）可種六七百株行間約六市尺，株距約一尺五寸，每埫地施肥千餘市斤。西瓜最忌灌溉，除久旱不雨，在萬不得已時才酌量澆水外，若水量稍多，則减低瓜實的糖分，品質也要變壞，所以這也是瓜類非在砂田栽種不好的原因。（砂田能犬量吸收並含蓄水份，且可抗鹼），西瓜的栽培是辛勤的，它的主人會因一陣風或暴雨替它焦灼，給它覆上一個陶器來遮蔽風雨。在它生長過一百一。二十天之後，便摘下用羊皮筏從黃河順利而下，到雷壇河瓜市去應市了</p>
<p>花皮品種　最負盛與</p>
<p>西瓜均呈橢圓形。白皮的上市最早，花皮是蘭州最負盛名的西瓜，且產量亦多，它的上市，即是瓜季的頂點，黑皮爲晚熟種，每年上市在八月初旬。以上三種，以品質論：花皮最優，黑皮次之，白皮更次之以經濟價値論：白皮除有早市的利益外，若在三種同時上市時，則以黑皮價格最高，花皮次之，白皮則望塵莫及了。由於運輸的不便，西瓜醉瓜等各地所產，大都僅供當地銷售。至於瓜農的利益，據約略的調査：每埫地種瓜，可得純益百分之七十以上，比較栽培其他農作物的利益要優厚得多，這也是蘭州瓜類繁盛的主要原因。</p>
<p>特產醉爪名滿全國</p>
<p>醉瓜是眞正的蘭州特產，譽滿全國。因爲僅產於蘭州近郊的廟灘子，東崗鎭一帶，所以產量較少，也就「物以稀爲貴」了。據說醉瓜的品種，在日本和美國也有，呌作麝香瓜，在東南，高貴的仕女吃西點時，方能嚐到一些些。（均爲罐頭裝）而在蘭州，目前每個只賣三四十萬元，在每一次航班機裏，它被載往平·津·京·滬·漢·作貴重的禮品供人淺嚐·你別看它的體小皮粗，外面又蒙上一些龜裂似的條紋，但是剖開來瓤厚水多，吃時甘美香醇。它是瓜菓中的仕女班頭，風頭最健！</p>
<p>華萊士瓜試種極佳</p>
<p>另一種與醉瓜味兒相彷的，名呌「華萊士瓜」，是華萊士來蘭時所贈的烏克蘭（一說美國）名種，在蘭州試種幾年，結果極佳。前一兩年，在產量上，幾有壓倒一切，獨霸市塲的趨勢。只是今年流年不利，產量銳减約百分之三十。華萊士瓜的皮爲潤滑的淡黃色，瓜瓤與醉瓜相似，只是糖份過多，水份終不及醉瓜的合適。好的醉瓜，有一種撲鼻的酒香，華萊士瓜和哈密瓜，便無法與之抗衡。</p>
<p>哈密瓜爲哈密移來的種子，試種多年，總不及原產地的好，也不能製瓜乾，近年的產量，已由華萊士瓜取而代之了。</p>
<p>醉瓜，華萊士和哈密瓜，均種於砂田其栽培方法與西瓜大致相同，辛勤猶且過之。還有一種籽瓜，形狀較西瓜小，籽多皮薄，專取籽用，蘭州一帶每年可產瓜籽二四二·二〇〇市斤，終年烘炒後，供消閑之需。</p>
<p>梨果豐碩堪耐久藏</p>
<p>提起蘭州的水菓，其中最著名而產量也最鹽的，便是梨。梨的品種很多，有幾種還是地道的特產，雖然確實的產量還無人精確調査過，但因梨菓堪耐貯藏，蘭州氣候也適於菓品的貯藏，所以一年到頭，市塲上總有它們的踪跡，成爲消費最多的鮮菓。它在蘭州的地位，堪爲南方的柑橘相埒。</p>
<p>軟兒梨等產量最多</p>
<p>梨的品種大致有下列幾種：（一）長把梨：八月間即上市，菓皮淡褐，每個約重二三兩，菓肉白而稍硬，味略酸，不算上品。（二）酥木梨：中秋上市，菓皮淡黃，肉白而鬆脆，每個約重三四兩，品質較前者爲佳。（三）窩梨：中秋後登市，菓皮黃綠，肉細而澀，次貯藏至肉質變軟後才能吃。（四）軟兒梨：爲蘭州產量最多，也最有名的特產。十月中成熟，每個重約四五兩，菓皮淡黃而味澀肉含砂粒，不宜生吃，須窖藏到嚴冬，待其凍硬變成黑色時，浸入凉水中就會變軟，剝皮吸食肉水，冽凜香甜。初來蘭州的人，見菓皮滿是灰塵，又硬如鐵蛋，簡直不敢問津，待吃過一兩次後，大都會嗜之如命的。（五）吊彈子：形似鴿蛋，約一兩重，初摘時淡褐色，吃起來很澀，須與軟兒梨一樣的貯藏到過了年，待其變黑變軟後，一串串的應市，像吃葡萄似的一口一個，別有風味。（六）冬菓梨：爲蘭州最著名的梨，其產量僅次於軟兒梨，但是冬季唯一的鮮菓。十一月間始成熟，最宜貯藏，次年五六月猶可見有販賣。菓皮黃綠，有粗細薄厚之分，肉白細而脆，漿汁甚多，甘酸適度，不亞於華北的鴨兒梨。採後即可生吃，經貯藏後，其味更美，煮食尤別具風味，蘭州冬夜的熱冬菓，洵稱上品。</p>
<p>桃李杏棗各有千秋</p>
<p>此外如桃·李·杏·棗·櫻桃·柿子·胡桃·蘋菓·莎菓·紅擒·葡萄，……都有栽培。不但形狀不同，味兒也各有千秋。尤其是桃·杏和蘋菓，產量多而味美。價値更是便宜。每年入秋後，各種菓子先後擁上市塲，街頭巷尾，五色繽紛，交列雜陳，商販呌賣聲，響徹雲霄，是瓜菓城最旺盛的季節。</p>
<p>果乾外銷爲數警人</p>
<p>蘭州附近的菓園瓜地，觸目皆是，入夏菓子長大，枝不勝載，則輔以高竿，絡以細繩，使它隨意發展而成收穫豐碩的美果。這些瓜菓的年產量，雖無精確統計，但多多少少，一樣被吃光或製成果乾，行銷外地。據說每年果乾的產量，要達一·二七二·五〇〇市斤，甜杏仁三五·〇〇〇市斤，每年外銷可達二五〇·〇〇〇市斤。</p>
<p>瓜菓城的栽培方法，數百年來一仍舊貫，甘肅省農業改進所雖在蘭州，但只能做一些改良的實驗工作，「中國菒園」的興盛，還得經受一番科學的洗禮。</p>

<h3>證劵交易所暫停營業後　全部交易交割清楚　所方勸吿經紀人勿作違法交易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海證劵交易所遵令自八月二十日起暫停營業後，即規定各經紀人巳做交易於廿三廿四兩日辦理交割淸楚。茲悉各經紀人巳做交易額達金圓二千四百餘萬元，（原爲法幣七十二萬九千餘億元）巳全部依照規定，辦理交割淸楚。本報記者頃訪該所總經理王志莘氏，據吿各經紀人如此龐大交割數字，兩日中全部辦理交割淸楚，殊可欣慰。並稱渠對此次證交奉令暫停營業，認爲非特爲政府施行財政經濟緊急處分令之必要措施，且對各經紀人業務前途，亦屬有利。將來政府推行公債政策，鞏固發行準備，並爲導引以前呆滯於金鈔之資金流入生產建設途徑時，證交之使命更爲重大。至民營金業爲配合國策，促進生產，其資金之來源，尤須證交機構之協助。故至適當時機，政府必令准該所迅速復業。希望各經紀人恪遵法令，嚴目檢肅，勿作違法交易之行爲，以免引人指責，影響復業日期。該所並巳將此旨通函各經紀人，在該所停業期間，勿作違法交易之行爲，以致影響復業之日期云。</p>
<p>上海證劵交易所經紀人公會，二十四日舉行理監事聯席會議，到會全體理監事，主席王理事長乃徐，商討奉令暫停營業後會務，決議定本月二十六日召集臨時會員大會。並通知各經紀人，在未奉令復業以前，恪遵規定，一律停止代客賣買證劵業務云。</p>
<h3>紗業公會緊急通吿　售紗不得超越限價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗業公會昨在市塲張貼緊急公吿，略以查八二十日，政府公布之加强管制經濟辦法第十三條內開；「全國各地各種物價，及勞務價格，應照民國三十七年八月十九日各該地各種物品貨價，依兌換率折合金圓出售，由當地主管官署嚴格監督執行，」曁同辦法第十四條內開：「各種物品及勞務價格，依前條折合金圓後，應嚴格執行取締違反限價議價條例，其有特殊原因者，非經主管官署核准，不得加價』等因。茲將八月十九日本市各種棉紗價格，折合金圓列表於後，凡本市塲棉紗買賣，應依表列價格，不得超越。除由本會市塲管理委員會隨時嚴厲監督外，務希各會員萬勿故違功令，致蹈法網，是爲至要。</p>
<h3>紗市交易閑散</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以業中銀根鬆弛，廠家拋售意懈，人心因上日暴挫，本街活動吸納，客路津粵漢口等帮，買氣復盛，市勢大都看好。惟因幣制改革後，當局爲奉行國策，抑平物價起見，塲內經警人員監視甚嚴，公會方面亦經勸吿同業，不准超越十九日之行情，因此交易閑散。但初開市氣頗呈蓬勃，嗣各經紀人受勸吿後，均不做越限市盤，交易淸稀，細紗甚鮮做開，僅卅二支及廿一支二十支十支等紗做開四五種，行情微挺五十至七十元。午後謠傳富局將暫禁轉口，人心遂呈恍惚，各方靜待當局措置，交易未做，塲外亦無聞喊價。</p>
<h3>棉布漲達限度</h3>
<p>棉布市况，以央行放出收兌金銀頭寸一部份游資潛入市塲，業內銀根亦鬆，一般人心看俏，散戶乘機抬高賣出，布商及染廠觀望，塲內雖有同業吐售，買勢終難遏止。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開即跳二元七角，時賣戶續吐，市盤小挫五角，旋因圈外物資蠢動，買戶較衆，紡建公司雖有配售龍頭細布及四君子嗶嘰，仍無標售，至十一時許，聞紗市上升，布商喊價亦冉冉上揚，卒以廿九元一角收市，比上日回漲四元一角，較十九日之限價差四角許。其餘各布亦均轉俏，惟色布士林布仍維原盤，成交二千八百疋。</p>
<p>又訊：聞收後龍頭細布及四君子嗶嘰，升達限度，午後則紛傳紗市掮客有因塲外喊價而被逮捕，業中人心驟吿虛怯，龍頭細布盤低至廿八元五角，四君子嗶嘰亦小至廿七元有成交，其他各布，較之午收均告小挫。</p>
<h3>各絲廠處境困難　提供二項意見</h3>
<p>蘇浙滬區　絲工業同業公會，前因各絲廠處境困難，曾召開理監事會，商討補救辦法，經陳理事長藹士向有關各方洽商後，聞協導會方面巳擬訂補救方案，但延未決定，故各絲廠仍存觀望。</p>
<p>據該業中人云：目前亟待解決之問題，（一）協導會技術處，自公佈七月份上半月之繅工費用後，對七月份下半月，及八月份上半月兩期之繅工費用，未能按時公佈，各廠咸感無法墊付，故望協導會對每期繅工費用，儘早公佈，以免各絲廠遭受損失。（二）自幣制改革後，政府對出口商品更加關注，各絲廠代政府繅製生絲，其收購辦法自應力求合理。</p>
<h3>人絲恢復配售　本週繼續標售成品</h3>
<p>中央信託局，業定今日上午十時舉行人絲議價會議，同時恢復配售，以供市需。又上週該局標出各項物資，總値金圓券二十萬元，茲爲配合當局頒佈新經濟措施，本週仍繼續大量標售。聞其間物資，以行局收購成品爲多。</p>
<h3>我改革幣制後　港方極抱樂觀</h3>
<p>〔商品調查所香港廿三日訊〕自我國改革幣制後，中外人士，對於金圓劵前途，均抱樂觀態度。其理由爲：（一）政府刻仍擁有巨量物資，及美國援華物品陸續而來。且政府此次發行金圓券，必謹愼從事，並有上項物資作爲後盾，自可隨時抽緊銀根，不使其鬆濫。（二）幣値安定後，政府稅收，實質上可以增加。（三）僑匯亦可大爲增加。（四）出口結匯，自宣佈照美金新匯率折算後，出口貿易可以加强，結匯之數，亦可增加。凡此種種，均足加强金圓劵之準備，而趨於安定。荀金圓劵獲得安定，則美國所加諸我國之援助，更將加强。金圓券發行後，對本港方面之影響，亦頗重要。（一）如金圓劵獲得安定，本港金融市塲中之黃金，美匯，美鈔，規鈔，期鈔及內匯，均將陷入牛皮狀態，而不若目前之熱鬧，故銀業界首受影響。（二）如金圓劵安定後，我國必定入寬輸入，則本港對我國貿易，可能增加。（三）走私內地者，以金融之安定，亦以較以前爲活躍。（四）內地港幣本位之風，必然消滅。流通內地少港幣，自然逐漸回港，使本港市面籌碼增加。同時內地資金，逃港數亦必自减，使本港能逐漸恢復其正常狀態。其予本港之影響，亦頗良好。</p>
<h3>黃金白銀及外幣　江海關限制出入　超過規定數量者一律沒收</h3>

<h3>產地價挫人心虛軟　食米再見下降　麵粉食油等一致回升</h3>
<p>米市續降，因錫市下跌，人心甚虛，執貨者自感產地巳低，故亦抑價而售，但米店納胃依然懈淡，價乃再見下降。南市塲粳秈米均降一元，北市塲則跌二十元之內，北市塲特高粳二十一元五角，崑山新秈米十七元二角，糙秈米連袋開十三元。昨日到貨因天雨而减少，二市塲共計三七四八石。</p>
<p>麵粉　止跌轉升，因銀根轉鬆，業外物價報漲，人心趨堅，實銷及散戶趁機吸取，市氣重告上轉，各脾粉大都出七元外。老車最高曾達七元三角五分，收市七元二角。兵船粉六元八角開市，收市爲六元九角五分，計漲三角及三角五分。紅蜂，建成，各開七元，雜牌粉均升三四角，麩皮略昂。</p>
<p>雜糧　均轉昂挺，因銀根之轉鬆，客幫納胃轉殷，貨主亦扣緊而售。黃豆初升二角後因油餅上漲，遂再上挺，終漲五角。苞米及元麥靑島幫納胃甚暢，俱升一元五角之譜。蠶豆稍昂，紅糧無交易。芝蔴價格尙平，去化甚活。生仁較上日喊價升一元，大汶口生仁收市三三元</p>
<p>食油　又見上漲，原因爲銀根轉鬆，業外物價上升，執貨者心思旣堅，本街及散戶之納胃又濃。豆油開市五十元，最後大有豆油回籠貨五十二元，已達八月十九日之限價。其他豆油爲五十一元五角，生菜油收市四十六元，各漲三元，生油亦挺三元，吉桶生油六十一元，小車蔴油加一元。豆餅隨升三角，利字餅四元三角。</p>
<h3>銀根已見鬆動　行局繼續差出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲金圓劵發行第二日，市塲銀根較前日有顯著之鬆動。金融圈內頭寸大多軋存，故均能應付裕如。即圈外各業，拆借亦已較日前方便，緊勢頓弛，暗息自六角步跌至四角五分。</p>
<p>國家行局庫繼續差出一三三萬元。內中央出五一一萬元，大交換入一一二萬元，洋商出三萬元，小交換入二四萬元。中國入八萬元，交通入三〇三萬元，中農中信各入一三萬元，郵匯入三二萬元，合作金庫入九萬元。</p>
<p>票據交換所交換情形，亦已恢復平靜狀態，下午五時許，巳吿軋淸。昨日計交換票據二六二，九六五張，交換總金額六三，七九七，二二二，〇〇〇元，較日前大爲减少。日前軋出退票張數計一三八三六張，金額二，二四〇，七一八·一一元。昨日退票三九五〇張，金額七九六，四〇三·七九元，退票張數及金額亦見銳减。</p>
<h3>本年一月至五月　出口結匯數發表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會方面透露：本年度一至五月份，雖因國內產品成本日高，及國行外匯牌價過低，出口業一度萎縮，但五個月來向指定銀行之結匯數字，亦達九一·九八八·一三八美元，較上年度同期之結匯數字一〇七·一〇三·三三三美元，僅减少百分之十四强。</p>
<h3>外匯平準基金會　奉令辦理結束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行頃奉行政院令：財政經濟緊急處分令公佈後，外匯平準基金委員會原有外匯掛牌市價，應予取消。該會幷經奉令辦理結束，現巳停止收交</p>
<h3>出售國營事業</h3>
<p>準備工作漸趨積極</p>
<p>關於出售國營事業，因新經濟措施方案，巳有明文規定。故準備出售工作，巳漸趨積極。工商部所屬之中國紡織建設公司，陳兼董事長啓天，業定本週六（廿八）日來滬，主特該公司第十三次董事例會。對出售該公司準備工作，有所指示云。</p>
<h3>行莊增資辦法　行局電財部請示</h3>
<p>行莊增資問題，財政經濟緊急處分令，尙無明文之規定。國家行局之增資事宜，無從辦理，如以戰前之五千萬元，按金圓券折算，祗十六元有奇。其增咨標準，定係按指數計算，或有其他規定，巳向財部請示辦法中。</p>
<h3>茶市過程岑靜</h3>
<p>昨日茶市：過程依然岑靜，交易缺乏實際做開，緣自執主對於紅綠茶，多以金圓券喊價，且與上週不同，輸出商感於本月內並無船期，兼以彙報國外之經過情形，尙未獲得覆音，是以買氣咸懷猶豫，趨勢乃續呈進出兩寂之象，綜觀此種情形，本週內恐難開朗云。</p>

<h3>教局召集私產中小校長會商下期收費問題　私校主張不惟硬性規定限制各校　各方意見將彙呈市長作最後決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市大專學校學雜費標準業經各校長商定，爲金圓券八十元至一百元。市敎局李局長於昨日下午四時召集各私立中小學校長，假育才中學商談收費問題，出席一百五十餘人，會議歷二小時半。因各校長所提之標準與李局長建議之標準不能接近，將彙呈吳市長核定。</p>
<p>闡述爲教育而辦學</p>
<p>座談會開始，首由李局長說明政府幣制改革，故收費數額應以薪幣單位計算。並希望發習者於論及此一問題時必須念及敎育界爲敎育而敎育，爲敎育服務而辦學校。繼即開始討論，私立中小學聯合會萬爾相認爲政府現改革幣制，係欲求恢復至戰前情形；戰前政府對學校收費不加限制，故希望現在政府對各校收費亦不加限制，不以規定數字束縛各校。</p>
<p>主張按照戰前加倍</p>
<p>該會原則上希望收費數字恢復至戰前標準。如戰前收八元者現應收十六元，戰前收二十元者，現應收四十元。繼由各區私校校長聯誼會一代表發言，均認爲各校所處地區不同，收費標準不能一槪而論。郊區各校因區內居民貧苦，上學期等收費向較政府規定之標準低廉，否則無人上學，袛有關門。故均認爲政府對私校收費不應硬性規定限制，可由各校分別視設備等實際情形自定。各區代表並報吿各區已定之收費標準。</p>
<p>希望不作硬性規定</p>
<p>南洋模範校長沈同一繼稱：該校戰前學雜費高中收五十二元，初中四十二元，小學卅六元。如規依金圓券計算高中應爲一百另四元，初中八十四元，小學七十二元。但依此標準收取，事實上亦不能辦到。因希望政府對學校收費不必硬性規定。道中女中校長崔堅吾認爲敎育事業係良心事業，勿斤斤較量。渠歸納代表出席各校畏之意見，提出學雜費標池爲小學二十元至四十元，初中四十元至六十元，高中六十元至八十元。</p>
<p>教局建議收費標準</p>
<p>李局長至此表示渠本人一向主張對學校收費不加硬性規定，一方面多設免費額，顧及淸寒子弟。但學校收費固須顧及敎師生活及學校開支，亦須顯及一般家長負担，否則必致發生甚多糾紛。渠認爲現今食米等價格折合金圓券後，雖照戰前加倍，但收費照戰前標準加倍計算，並不合理。即以公敎人員待遇論，較戰前猶低。渠根據敎局之推算，建議小學學雜費標準爲二十元至二十五元，初中三十五元至四十五元，高中四十五元至五十五元。各校長對李局長之建議多認爲不能接受，未獲決定，乃吿散會。李局長將彙同各校長之意見及渠之建議呈請吳市長作最後決定。</p>
<p>局長說明計算根據</p>
<p>敎局計算收費之根據，係依私校敎師特遇相同於市校教師推算，現市校初中敎員薪給平均數爲法幣底薪二百八十元，打折扣後折合金圓八十八元。每班敎員以二人計算每月薪給共一七六元，每班以六個月算，薪給共一〇五六元，照親定以百分之七十充俸給費，以百分之三十充辦公費；辦公費爲四五八元，每班六個月薪金奧辦公費總數共爲一五一四元。每　學生人數以四十八人計，除百分之二十五規定免費額則爲三十六人，以支出總數除三十六人，則初中每生應應繳之數爲四十二元。高中及小學亦依此公式算，高中敎員薪給平均數爲法幣底薪二百八十元，小學敎員爲一百八十元，依此可知高中每人應司繳之費爲五十二元，小學爲二十四元餘·</p>
<h3>李局長苦口婆心　勸私校改變作風</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市敎局李局長昨在私立中小學校長討論收費問題會議席上除闡述辦學爲敎育服務外，並提出多點，苦口婆心勸勉各私校注意：（一）市校與私校敎師待遇不能相差太遠。（二）自本學期起，各校不論收費多少，應將百分之七十作爲敎職員薪津，以一次發淸爲原則；如分期發給，則多餘之款不能由校長一人私自保管。應由校長與敎職員代表共同組織保管委員會。（三）希望各校學生家長會從速成立，對學校可隨時監督協助。（四）各校免費額必須儘量擴充，俾使貧苦子弟亦得入學。（五）以往有甚多不良作風，應予革除，留額金辦法即其一例。書籍費亦不能强迫收取。（六）學生申請免費，須由各校負責切實考核。有少數學校敎師對免費生心存歧視或輕視情形，使免費學生精神上感受莫大痛苦，此種「反敎育」現象，校長應即予以吿誠。</p>

<h3>世運籃球安慰賽　輕取英國記　雙方完全紳士風度　自始至終輕鬆異常</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鍾震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕世運會八月九日起田徑和游泳的節目，均告結束，各項成績並沒有理想中的滿意。各項球賽，大部進入複賽或決賽。籃球循環賽中，產生了一個新的安慰賽（Consolation　Round）就是在初賽中被淘汰的數隊，再來作一次比賽，以排列名次，使失敗的數隊，也可略以自慰。吾國隊不幸，亦進入此安慰圈中，前天首逢到瑞十隊，凱奏而歸，今天（八月十一日）遇到世運會的地主——英國隊了。</p>
<p>八月十一日（星期三）下午二時，在哈林蓋健身房舉行比賽，又逢到大雨如注，此次運動會除開幕後二天是晴天外，其餘不是陰沉，即是下雨，如此亞劣的氣候，不論使選手或觀衆，都大爲掃興。</p>
<p>此塲比賽演來相當別緻，雙方滇來完全是紳士風度，自始至終，輕鬆異常，英國隊隊員，雖個個都是身高六尺以上，但動作之呆滯，無可形容，從不奮勇劫奪，球到手後，遲緩不進。吾國隊員亦以從容不迫姿態，以五十四比二十五輕取英隊，吾國諸隊員，屢屢玩弄小技巧，使對方手足無措，博得友邦觀衆掌聲不絕。比賽經過如次：</p>
<p>我國隊陣容：</p>
<p>（于瑞章）　黃天錫</p>
<p>吳成章　蔡文華（賈志軍）</p>
<p>李世僑　包松圓</p>
<p>吾軍仍以日前同樣陣容應戰，開球後黃天錫犯規，彼英隊　進一球。但頃刻間，蔡文華以遠射進一球，成二比一。英國隊二衛不事截奪，屢次被判罰球。四比一，混戰良久，吾國隊始終佔上風，比敷相差八九分之多，上半時二十三對十四，吾國佔先。下半時，易地再戰，吾國諸隊員精神突然振作，分數扶搖直上。瞬息間成二十七比十四。對方有時偶然進得一球，但吾軍即報以二球，二隊分數相差益多。在最後十分鐘內，成爲四十六比二十一。宋敎練調遣于瑞章及賈志軍上塲，演出更爲精彩，英國隊員無選手餘地，結果以五十四比二十七吿終，吾國隊大勝。</p>
<h3>聾啞座談會　樓文敖發表　跑畢萬米獲得記念章　馬拉松腳底創痛退出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市聾啞獲錫三等，昨日下午在靑年會，招待甫自英倫世運兪會歸國之噸將樓文敷。樓氏發表稱：參加萬米及馬拉松兩項，不幸均吿敗　，十分遺憾。至於失敗原因，列舉兩點：（一）萬米係穿釘鞋，跑至中途，釘鞋出了毛病，脚底摩擦受傷出血，勉强跑壨全程，獲得紀念章一枚，惟未能得分。（二）馬拉松穿跑鞋，底面係薄的，渠本來欲買較厚的跑鞋參加角逐，奈以時間不許，只好穿了。發步後，渠曾在半程中名列前茅，後因路途高低不平，而脚底負創，疼痛甚劇，不得不在中途退出，　息不置。關於五千米第七名，表示否認。最後樓錫三勉勵啞將養精蓄銳，將來一顯身手。</p>
<h3>最後一戰　草草終塲　敗於義大利</h3>
<p>十八日下午二時，我隊又復在哈村蓋健身房與義大利隊交手，爭安慰賽冠軍。義大利之球藝，並不高明，以過去吾隊之成績，十九可獲勝利，但不料今日演出，大爲失望，諸隊員在上半時作戰，尙有精神，此後純爲敷衍性質，結果草草終塲，其中最大原因，因諸隊員明日下午四時，均將搭機返國，無心應戰，加以左衛黃天錫已於昨日返星加坡，隊中缺少一生力軍，陣勢更形鬆懈，戰來成績之不行，實爲歷來比賽所僅見。吾隊陣容如次：</p>
<p>（于瑞章）　吳成章　李世僑　（蔡忠強）</p>
<p>蔡文華</p>
<p>李震中　包松圓</p>
<p>開球後，吾隊攻守尙够標準，義大利中鋒身材高大，翻身投籃，準確無比。開始一人連進數球，經宋敎練指示吾隊員釘煞後，此君一籌莫展，雙方分數別的漸接近。十比十四，中間我國曾以十九對十七一度領先，上半時二十五對二十一，吾軍輸四分。</p>
<p>下半時易地再戰，李震中調出，賈志軍入替，最初兩隊相差，不過在四五分之問。在最後一刻鐘內，吾隊諸球員疲能暴露，陣勢空前混亂，右衛包松　獨自　球，懈於守衛，聯絡盡失，全塲爲義大利所控制，分數扶搖直上，以四十比廿六遙遙領先。吾軍調兵遣將，終不能挽同大局，以五十四對三十八草草了事。</p>

<p>査小學組報名單中，右中學生冒名原替者，此種行爲，不僅有背道德，且足室塞小朋友前進之路，希望頂替之人，能自動退出，否則將予檢舉，撤消其資格，並通知其所屬學校之敎導處。</p>

<h3>童年所訂婚約　男女雙方同意解除</h3>
<p>傳華問　鄙人於十歲時曾由父母作主　某君訂定婚約，茲因雙方均已成年，爲願及將來幸福計，決定將該婚約予以解除、而鄙人表示此項意見後，對方亦未表示反對，並來兩謂對解除婚約無意見，任鄙人自由處理。最近復來函向鄙人索取一贊同解除婚約之意見書」一紙，以使登報。鄙人接兩後當予照辦：唯事隔數月，並未目其登報，而鄙人向其函索同式之一贊同解除婚約之意見書」亦未見答　，茲有法律問題數則，請惠予答說爲感。（一）某君「對解除婚約無意見，托鄙人自由處理」之函件，是否可作爲某君同意解除婚約之證件？（二）如上述兩件可作爲證件，則鄙人用雙方名義登報解除婚約，是否合法？如由鄙人單方而登報聲明該項婚約無效，再剪報通知某君，是否合法？（三）單方而登報聲明，是否一定須請律師證明？如必須律　證明而無力負担鉅額費用時，有　其他補救辦法？（四）登報後，將報剪寄某　，是否即算手續完畢？（五）某君旣表示「無意見」，則某君是否表示放棄請求「損害賠償」權？</p>
<p>〔唐鳴時先生答」（一）來問謂十歲訂定婚約。査民法規定：男未滿十七歲，女未滿十五歲，不得訂定婚約（民法第九百七十三條）。十歲訂約，旣屬禁止範圍，自應認爲無效。而無效之婚約，即屬婚約不成立。（二）爲免除世俗誤會，自可單方而登報，宣吿國：該項婚約依民法規定無效，無所謂解除。（三）登報不必定須請律師；但若情　曲　，或法理不明，則宜商請律師（即法律專家）爲之析辨．（四）有過失，方有損害賠償；着無過失，即不負損害賠償之責任。（五）原屬無效之婚約，一經宣吿，意旨已明。郎不宣吿，亦不受拘東也。</p>
<p>按此項救濟金，專爲孤寡殘廢老弱貧病之難胞所設，申請手續爲繕　申請書一份，自述身世及家庭狀况，經當地保長或的喪　章證明，並覓舖保掛號寄本報館社會服務科審核，其經派員調査屬實者，均酌給助金。</p>
<p>近來物價高漲，助金數額，不得不略事增加，原有業金，即將吿罄，希各界熱心讀者，本已飢已溺之忱，慷慨捐輸，使此　古難同胞，獲得人類同情之慰藉，重鼓求生之勇氣，是則本欄同人所殷切盼望者也。</p>
<p>（福州路胡知覺意見）</p>
<p>貴局收受電報於上午十一時起至下午三時左右，因發報人辦擠，點費手續麻煩，需守候二小時以上，有　電報迅　服務之原則，謹實二點意見，（一）計算字數及報頭內各項，可明自通吿塡寫方法，傳發電人冉行計算，塡註於去報紙報頭內，營業州員僅需複核開列收據，以省手續，（二）仿照郵票方法發行電報代價劵，由發電人黏貼，經電局一收費處蓋印驗訖，如此可免收點現鈔之煩，减少守候時間。</p>
<p>（答）蒙賜高見，殊深感荷，第一點各項本局早經注意，並於最近新出之價目表內　註報頭之塡註方法及報費之計算公式，以便發電人能自行計費及塡寫。唯初次進行，必不能十分滿意，本局將盡力宣傳電報拍發手續及計費方法，藉補上述缺點。至第二點因電報與信件之性質不同，前者諭字計費即同一種電報因半數多寡或報類不同而報費有增减。不若後者諭件計費較爲簡單，發行電報代價券目前尙難實施，本局現正與交通銀行共同研究發行電信支票一種，以代現鈔，一俟硏究完善，即將推行</p>

<p>事之最爲繁複難究者，莫過於政治。依今日的化學知識，我們知道若干氫氣加以若千　氣，其結果終必爲水；以今日的天文知識，於何日將日蝕，於何日將月蝕，雖遠在天際，亦可以推測得分移不差。而獨於人類最切身的政治，却是至今尙無精確可循之原理原則。但思歷代之所以興亡盛衰，史上某公某卿之某政某舉究竟是功是罪，後世人言言殊，雖曾有深思熟慮之士，窮年累月，詳硏博究，而今尙難得一確論。以言今日，而謂一政一策之興革，其實效將如何，乃爲片言可決，其誰能信？嘗讀過去名流大員的　言宏論，每發現其凡所論列，與其事後之發展，十九　枘不符，而當其發表之日，人們拜讀之下，亦未始無爲之心折者。以彼律此，則今之宏論讜言，其價値爲何如，亦可思過半矣。</p>
<p>政論之所以難獲精確，在於人之不能無私；不能無私，則出言不免虛妄。蓋人爲羣之一員，以人言羣事而絕不參以私意成見，純以超然物外之客觀態度出之，一如站在其他星球之上審察人世之動作然，此殆非常情之所能。東坡詩「不識廬山眞面目，只緣身在此山中」，正是指此。轉不若遠在天際的星象反可觀察得淸淸楚楚，深在地底的岩層能够測勘得明明白白。面於自身人事之安排，却如盲人在黑暗之中捉黑貓一般，絕難有把握之可言。</p>
<p>例如本市的馬路，有的像是臃腫的大腿忽而轉爲鷺鷥的瘦經，有的環繞作三角形，其中的房屋恰如海上的礁岩，更有彎曲如弓或交叉如葛藤者。形狀旣醜怪，又復促成了今日交通上的諸種不便。其所以致此者，只因當初地主寸土必爭，決不輕言犧牲之故。故如舉地主秉路政，必不能冀其大公無私，純爲事理着眼。廣而言之，以羣中之人言羣治，其不能全然忘却私利，在程度上容有差別，在性質上與地主之秉路政固無若無之不同也。</p>
<p>又如科學之至精確者莫如數字，一加一總是二，無人會說是三，而前一陣之『生活指數」無非是個數學問題，却常爲各界人士爭論之對象，每於指數公佈之日，或認爲太高，或嫌其過低，議論紛紛，莫衷一是。良以事關私人利害，議論致有不同；在老閣方面，一加一最好仍是一，在夥計方面，則是一加一最好是三。至於編製指數者初非高踞雲端之神明，其或有偏頗失平處，要亦無足深怪。故而今日人類，其智能製運轉圓滑的機器，而在人事方面尙無善策令製造機器的勞資雙方不起磨擦。</p>
<p>可見政之爲事，其道至難，而人們却以爲最易。無知的人姑不具論，然雖爲智識份子，其論政事亦多是想到什麼，隨口胡謅，於已有利者，則讚之上天，於已有損者，則肆意詆毀，其輕率不思，與販夫走卒初無二致。夫不諳天文者，鮮敢妄談天文，不懂地質者，鮮敢妄談地質，而今凡事涉政治，却僉以爲人人都懂，老少能談。甚至硏究天文地質之學者，於外行妄談天文地質，輒怪其僭越，訝其不自量力，而一涉政治，其自身却亦莫不有其一套高見，非但自認能談政治，抑且自信能幹政治，其科學於所學而不科學於所不學有如此。</p>
<p>近讀一套科學叢書，其中關於自然科學部門筆者讀了頗具開卷有益之感，而關於社會科學之著作却覺其所述殊多無根之談，與實際大有逕庭處，而著者固一代大儒，初非冬烘村學究，然尙不免虛妄如此，衷心深爲愕然，故爲略紓所感如上。</p>
<h3>坐監獄的編輯　南斯拉夫都城貝格拉</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>南斯拉夫都城貝格拉特城中，每一家報館，都有一個「坐監獄編輯』，這是一位由報館方面聘請他來專門爲報館代受罪過的編輯。如果報上發載了什麼觸犯當局的言論，那位編輯便將爲報館去坐牢監，如果報上刊登了篇署名的文字，而那篇文字却闖下了禍，偏偏寫這篇文章的人，又否認這是他的作品，那末這位「坐監獄的編輯』便將挺身出來，承認這文章是他所作，而將毫無難色地去坐牢獄，可是他出獄以後，報館就給他一筆可觀的津貼。</p>
<h3>一舉數得</h3>
<p>— 碩甫</p>
<p>自從結婚以後，我從　的那裏學到了一些小經驗。新婚之初，因爲一時找不到相當的僕人，現在的姚媽，也在鄕間，尙未來滬。因此，　除主持家務外，還得操勞一些家庭瑣事。她不但能安排得井然有序，而且頗能充分利用時間。譬如她在　子上煮開水的時候，抽空整理房間，或者上街買菜。等到買菜回來，水也熱了，房間收拾好了。她休息一會，就可準備午餐。逢到用文火煮肉或者別的什麼，還可抽出一些餘閑補些鈕扣，或者做一些其他的小活計。結果，她在一天之內，做了許多事，却並不比人家忙碌，也不比人家加倍疲勞。</p>
<p>俗諺云：「一箭雙鵰」，我從妻的工作中，領略了一舉數得的爲用無窮。譬如說，最近電話漲價了，在打電話之前，我須事先考慮一下，決定二三件事，同時與通話對方接洽。這可以包括：（一）向對方探詢另一友人的地址，（二）向對方示意問好，（三）答應或委託對方代辦某事…自然能想到的事愈多，則使用電話也最經濟。</p>
<p>又如以寫文章來說，我者看某雜誌編輯時，我可以：（一）將約定撰寫的稿件交給他，（二）接洽單行本的出版條件，（三）轉交友人所寫的文章……等等。</p>
<p>其次，我得閑讀書，尤其讀到關於傳記文學的這一類書時，我可以從中：（一）體驗立身行事與處世之道，（二）找寫文章的材料，（三）參考寫作的技巧……。</p>
<p>有人說得好：火車的發明，縮短兩地之間的距離；輪船的發明，縮短兩洲之間的距離；飛機的發明，則縮短全世界的距離。以上係就空間着眼，我想任何人能熟知一舉數得的妙處，同樣能縮短時間上的距離，而使個人的生活更充實與更有意義吧。</p>
<h3>也記大鶴山人</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>本攔有錢大成君所寫「記　大鶴」一文，茲就余所知補充此一篇。</p>
<p>大鶴山人姓鄭氏，名文焯，字叔間，塼學多通，尤精於詞，世以比宋之美成，白石，夢窗。二十歲時（民前光緒元年），中順天鄉試恩科舉人，其後會試八次，均厲而不售。在光緒廿九年補行辛丑會試時，山人年已四十八矣，絕意進取，自鐫一私印，文曰江南退士，以示無意作進士也。晚年在蘇州孝義坊購地五畝建築新居，膀曰通德里。其東高岡迤邐，即吳小城故址，作亭於城之高處，膀曰吳東亭，繞以竹籬，憑眺甚佳。其下一水終回，即子城　，所謂錦帆涇是也。</p>
<p>山人詞與朱彊邨齊名，彊邨老人亦於晚年卜居吳城小市橋聽楓剌，兩詞人時相過從。在民前，巡撫江蘇者，均慕山人才名，延贊幕府，豐其　給，資其　議，故山人僑吳三十餘年，能蔚成一代詞宗。及入民國，儒生不爲世重，生計因之短絀，山人乃出其餘技，鬻畫行醫，聊以瞻家，時往還滬蘇間。其大鶴山人潤格，乃朱彊邨數人所代訂，茲錄於後，可以藉知山人之爲人，與其晚年之境遇。</p>
<p>「高密鄭叔問居士，晚號大鶴山人，疏放不羈，四海朋舊，皆一時知名士。僑吳三十餘年，自謂山澤之臞，絕意仕進，屢徵不起。隱居吳小城東，治園五畝，著書終老，凡訓詁，考據，詞章之學，以及音呂，醫經，氣緯諸秘書，無不硏究精奧纂述餘日，輒以書畫游藝，其筆趣高逸，不减大滌·雪個一流，好之者嘗以良金致之，江南爲之紙貴。茲以避世海濱，同志慫恿，爲仿君家板橋道人故實、擬定潤筆例以應世求，亦賢者治生之一道也。」</p>
<p>山人於六十三歲逝世（即民七年）。前一年，蔡孑民先生長北京大學校，浼羅　東聘山人爲金石學系主任兼校醫一席，山人有覆　東一書，茲亦錄後，閱之可知山人暮年雖窮困，仍極倔强也。</p>
<p>去臘展誦惠書，猥以悼亡，矜垂甚備，高義仁篤，荷遽相幷。重承任公老友厚賻頒逮三百金，周急救凶，幽明均感，撫臆論報，銜戢深銘。祗以衰病之餘，少稽陳謝，伏惟豈弟之宥，代剴赤情，幸甚幸甚。茲値亡妻營奠有日，敢以計吿，敬求飭寄沽上爲感。下走集　餘年，遭家多難，比來知死知生，彌增鮮民之痛。昨承寄示孑民先生函訂大學主任金石學教科兼校醫一席，月薪約四百番錢，禮遇誠優且渥。第念故國埜遺，落南垂四十年，倦旅北遷，旣苦應接，且聞京師僕賃薪米之費，什倍於南，居大不易，蒿目世變，何意　比，頹放久甘，敢忝爲國學大都講乎？業醫賣畫，老而食貧，固其素也。辱附契末，聊貢區區，未盡願言，但有荒便。</p>
<p>山人三十八歲時，（光緒十九年），納吳趨歌兒張小紅，爲賦折紅梅詞。蓋宋代吳應之居吳城小市橋，有侍姬曰紅梅，因以名其閣，嘗製折紅梅二詞，傳播人口，山人仿之，並以冷紅名其詞集。錢大成君「記鄭大鶴」一文內言：「大鶴暮歲潦倒，恒携一老妾枯坐茶樓。」或即此張小紅耶？</p>
<h3>秋居感興</h3>
<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>倚檻雲容幻，明鐙雨氣沉。天長過百景，地迴得遐心。溪瀑回凉吹，山松裊夕陰。卜居渾戀此，未羨燕巢林。</p>
<p>漫話鴻冥事，聊爲豹隱謀。補天慙片石，出世已扁舟。人事誰迷復？山阿有問酬。酣眠空自放，鐘落五更頭。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>七夕之前夕，北平一位老壽星升天（九十四叟盧靖本齊）。中元之前夕，上海一位老壽星歸位（九十二叟陳　龍小石）。論籌則老盧比老陳多兩歲，論官則老陳比老盧大二品。（盧是提學使，陳是尙書總督。）</p>
<p>老陳官大，壽大，福大，歷任督撫之後，又在春申優游自在，做了三十七年的寓公，此北方語所謂「造化人兒」也。而最難得者：（一）重游泮水，（二）重宴鹿鳴，（三）重宴瓊林，三個階段，他都完成了。舊科名人物如此者實在不多，因「重游」「重宴」之所謂「重」，一「重」就是六十年之長距　，遇到干支相同的年分，乃謂之一重」。千支須六十年周而復始，故謂之周甲。</p>
<p>老陳是前淸同治十一年壬申考得一名「秀才」，雅言之日「入沖」，又曰「游庠」，年纔十六歲（申報創辦一齡）。至民國二十一年，又到了壬申，例有「重游泮水」的慶典，他的故主溥儀特頒「御筆」　題「　水春長」，朋友們賀詩不少，合刋「　春長集」。他自己的紀念詩說：「假年還向天公乞，桂籍秋風杏苑春。」意思是想再多多增壽，延長歲月，以待第二度的「桂籍秋風」（即鄕試）及第二度的一杏苑春風」（即會試）。寫此詩時巳七十六歲矣。果然次年「鄕舉重逢」又來了，即「重宴鹿鳴一也。</p>
<p>老陳是十九歲上得中乙亥舉人（淸光緒元年恩科），照例若遇先一科的正科年分，即算「鄕舉車逢」。乙亥的前科是癸酉，所以民國三十二年癸酉（即淸同治十二年癸酉之後六十年），溥儀又降下「聖旨」一道，賞給「太子少保銜」。他又有詩：「棘院又來前度客，華筵重上至公堂。」是指舊典而言。舊時，榜後有盛大的「鹿鳴宴」，新科舉人與主考各官行禮，六十年前的老舉人亦插花披紅來「重宴」，熱鬧無比，但自淸季停廢科舉以後，凡老科分之「重宴」，並無實地風光之可能，只有榮典佳話的虛文，聊以寄興。</p>
<p>老陳的秀才·舉人都很早，中舉纔十九歲，所以「重宴」之年還不到八十。然會試中式在丙戌（淸光緒十二年），時陳年已三十。則「重逢會榜一須至九十歲（三十加六十）。一個人活八十者已稀少，九十自更不易。即如俞曲園（樾），壽登八十有六，不爲不高，亦只「重逢鄕舉」而已。曲園八十二歲做重赴鹿鳴宴詩云；「尙有瓊林一杯酒，春風能否再留連？」希望再活幾年，趕上「瓊林重宴」的大慶。但是他中進士已三十歲（淸道光庚戎科），須至九十歲纔遇到「次庚戌」，老俞壽只八十有六，尙差四年。春風不待，此願竟虛。</p>
<p>老陳亦是三十歲上「春風」得意的（淸光緒丙戌），前年（民國三十五年）又逢舊曆丙戌，又完成重大階段了。惜乎他的故主溥儀已　零失所，與「五國城」之宋帝末路相似，巳無再頒榮典之可能。則前年滬上陳寓，似無慶祝之興趣，是爲芙中不足。</p>

<h3>Price Control and Crackdown on Hoarding: Ministry of Industry and Commerce Drafts Implementation Measures for Discussion at Today's Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] To strengthen price controls and crack down on hoarding, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been holding meetings for days to research and discuss the issue. This afternoon, the ministry held another meeting to discuss and draft implementation measures. The meeting of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce this afternoon began at 4:00 PM, presided over by Minister Chen Qitian, who had just returned to Nanjing from Shanghai this morning. The discussion lasted five and a half hours, adjourning at 9:30 PM. The important contents of the measures include the following: (1) To strengthen price controls, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will establish a Price Control Planning Committee. (2) Warehouses in the six major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, Qingdao, and Chongqing will be subject to increased inspection. (3) The storage of goods must not exceed one-third or one-quarter of the annual sales volume. Exceeding this amount will be considered hoarding and prosecuted. (4) Prices will be limited to the prices of August 19 as the standard; violators will be dealt with according to the price limit regulations. (5) Items prohibited from import will be prohibited from sale in the market from September 11. (6) For domestic materials that can be sold abroad to exchange for foreign currency, separate measures for conserving consumption will be drafted. (7) For certain items permitted for import, the quantity of permitted imports will also be designated and restricted. After the adjournment of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce meeting, Fei Mingyang, Director of the Price Control Department, organized the above measures and submitted them to Chen Qitian at 10:30 PM, who will submit them to the Executive Yuan for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Although the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have been actively drafting supplementary implementation measures to streamline finances and strengthen financial controls for days, only a portion has been completed. Only a portion will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on the 25th. Regarding raising the capital of banks and financial institutions and reorganizing financial institutions, the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance held multiple discussions on the 24th, but the maximum amount of the capital increase is still under consideration, and a final decision has not been drafted as of the 24th, so it will not be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on the 25th. However, the department's proposed amendment to the "Measures for Handling the Collection, Purchase, and Manufacture of Gold Ornaments by Silver Shops" has been submitted to Wang Yunwu, requesting that it be submitted to the Executive Yuan, and it is expected to be submitted on the 25th. The National Taxation Administration and the Local Finance Department have also drafted several amendments to tax rates and local finance measures, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion. The measures drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 24th also only initially completed the more important measures regarding price controls, crackdown on hoarding, and prohibition of the sale of imported luxury goods.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu again visited Premier Weng at the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 24th to review the positive results of the first day after the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes and to discuss supplementary implementation measures to streamline finances and strengthen financial controls. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian also met with Premier Weng in the morning after returning to Nanjing on the morning of the 24th. It is also learned that the Ministry of Finance originally scheduled a ministry meeting for the morning of the 24th, but because Wang Yunwu and Xu Baiyuan both went to the Executive Yuan to meet Premier Weng, and Vice Minister Li Tang also attended the meeting of vice ministers, there was no one to preside, so it was not held.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The preparation fund for the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes has been expedited by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with relevant agencies to prepare and submit a detailed list, which will be fully transferred to the custody of the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Preparation Fund Supervision Committee within days.</p>
<h3>Xu Baiyuan Meets with the President to Report on the Financial Situation in Shanghai; Four Allied Banking Administrations Schedule Meeting to Discuss Lending Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiguo returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 24th and immediately went to the Executive Yuan in the morning to meet Premier Weng and report on the financial situation in Shanghai after the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes, as well as the process of negotiating with various parties in Shanghai to implement several technical issues related to the currency reform. The President inquired in detail about the market's reaction to the currency reform.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the currency reform, state-owned banks were ordered to suspend lending for one week. Whether lending should continue to be suspended starting next week, and whether the lending policy should be changed in the future, all need to be reconsidered. The Four Allied Banking Administrations have scheduled a board meeting for the 28th to discuss various related issues regarding the lending or suspension of lending by state-owned banks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the bank interest rate was agreed to be 15%, the government, fearing that the interest rate was too high and would affect prices, decided to continue to lower it, reducing it to 10% or less. At the same time, strict restrictions will be imposed on the amount of gasoline used by cars in Shanghai, and the price of gasoline will be further reduced.</p>
<h3>More Than 36,000 US Dollars Exchanged in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Prices of Various Items Show Little Change</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The 24th was the second day for the exchange of Gold Yuan notes. The people of Nanjing were still very enthusiastic about bringing gold, silver, and foreign currency to the Central Bank for exchange. A total of US$36,211, 1.776 taels, 3 qian and 9 fen of gold, 39 taels and 9 qian and 6 fen of pure silver, HK$6,643, and more than 46,000 silver dollars were exchanged. The amount of legal tender exchanged for Gold Yuan is still being counted as of the morning of the 25th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The 24th was the second day of the issuance of Gold Yuan notes, and people were even more enthusiastic about bringing gold, silver, and foreign currency to the Central Bank for exchange. The procedure of changing the prices of goods in the market to Gold Yuan has mostly been completed today, and there has been little change in prices. According to the observations of general merchants, prices, which have been fluctuating for years, have now been stabilized due to the currency reform. Also, the general prices of goods here today are as follows: The retail price of rice is 21 yuan per shi for top-quality rice and 19 yuan for second-quality rice. The price of flour is 7 yuan per bag for Swan brand and 6 yuan and 9 jiao for Green Peony brand. The price of grains is 12 yuan per shi for wheat and 9 yuan and 1 jiao for millet.

<h3>Electricity Tariffs: Ministry of Industry and Commerce Drafts New Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is carefully drafting the electricity tariffs for state-owned and private electricity businesses in accordance with the principles stipulated in Articles 3 and 15 of the Measures for Streamlining Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls. It is estimated that these new prices can be approved and implemented in early September. Before the official order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is received, all electrical businesses will continue to charge in Gold Yuan based on the old prices of August.</p>
<h3>The Economic Cooperation Administration Decides to Cooperate with Our Country's Currency Reform</h3>
<p>Ralph Wheelon Expresses Sincerely</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Economic Cooperation Administration, This City, 24th] Ralph Wheelon, Director of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration, praised the Chinese government's implementation of new economic measures today. Wheelon assured that the Economic Cooperation Administration will fully cooperate with China's currency reform plan. Wheelon said: "The new economic steps taken by the Chinese government are commendable. These measures are a sincere effort by China to implement self-help, and therefore deserve our full support. The Economic Cooperation Administration will do its best to support this new plan and make it fully effective."</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Unscrupulous Merchants Raise Prices; Four Store Owners Detained and Sent to Justice</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th] A few unscrupulous merchants have raised the prices of goods. The municipal government began strict enforcement and crackdown this afternoon, detaining and sending to the court for investigation: Jiang Guangyin, Chairman of the Fresh Meat Industry Association, and Yu Tianshun, owner of Xieyuan Grain Store, Tongchang Grain Store, Wancheng Grain Store, and Yutianshun Department Store.</p>
<h3>The President Is Too Busy to Go to Kuling Again; Madame Chiang Will Return to Nanjing Within Days; She Told Reporters Yesterday That Currency Reform Requires the People's Support</h3>
<p>[Our Kuling Correspondent, 24th] Madame Chiang is scheduled to leave Kuling and return to Nanjing within days. At 6:00 PM on the 24th, Madame Chiang invited reporters from various newspapers in Kuling to visit the Children's Paradise and held an informal press conference, talking with the reporters for 40 minutes. In response to reporters' inquiries, Madame Chiang said that she would return to Nanjing soon, and the President was too busy and probably could not come to Kuling again. Madame Chiang had a very good impression of Lushan, saying that the streets were clean, but the entire construction still needed assistance from all parties. Discussing current affairs, Madame Chiang said that the amount of US aid was not large, but God helps those who help themselves. Currency reform requires the people's confidence and full support to succeed. Tolerance of criticism is a democratic style, but it is not about rigidly transplanting foreign things to China. Regarding making the rich pay, Madame Chiang advocated using persuasion to inspire conscience. Finally, Madame Chiang talked about newspaper reporters, saying that they should be "national pioneers," and in addition to accurate reporting, they should pay special attention to their words and deeds. At 6:45 PM, Madame Chiang shook hands with each reporter to say goodbye and walked back to the official residence along the original route.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce Supports New Currency; Proposes Suggestions for Stabilizing Prices; Song ZIwen Orders Crackdown on Capital Flight</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 24th] The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce recently held a symposium, unanimously supporting the new currency and proposing three suggestions for stabilizing prices: (1) Starting from the 25th, all stores in the city should uniformly use Gold Yuan notes to mark prices. (2) The prices of all goods should be based on the prices of the 19th, and public prices should be negotiated based on the Shenghui difference. (3) After the public prices are negotiated by each industry, they will not be raised again without government approval, and the rice price will be set at a maximum of 21 Gold Yuan and a minimum of 14.5 Gold Yuan per 100 shi jin, and will be approved and announced by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Ten groups of agriculture, industry, commerce, and fisheries in Guangdong sent a telegram on the 24th to support the government's currency reform.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 24th] After Chairman Zhu Ziwen concurrently served as the Economic Control Supervisor of the Secret District, he convened a financial and price symposium on the 22nd with the heads of relevant agencies. Zhu said: "This currency reform is more painful for the people of Guangdong than in other places. This is because in the past, tightening currency, stopping the southward flow of floating capital, and cracking down on speculation led to low Shanghai telegrams. One Hong Kong dollar on the black market in Shanghai was worth more than 2 million yuan, but in Guangzhou it was only 1.15 million yuan. With the issuance of cash Gold Yuan notes, the exchange rate for foreign currency is nearly the same as the Shanghai black market, but in Guangdong it is twice as different, which makes Guangdong prices also rise twice as much. Secondly, in the past two months, the government used force to stop smuggling. Smugglers only died five, with five or six hundred injured. The national army also had considerable losses. This is also something that other places do not have. However, this currency reform concerns the future of the country and the nation. Only success is allowed, not failure. Therefore, each industry needs to be advised to have a spirit of sacrifice to overcome all difficulties." Zhu also instructed Mayor Ouyang to convene another meeting to properly discuss ways to stabilize prices and crack down on capital flight, and instructed the Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters to draft measures to strengthen anti-smuggling.</p>
<h3>Macau Gold Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Overseas Merchants React Favorably to Currency Reform</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 24th] A group of 17 reporters from Guangzhou went to Macau for a trip on the 19th and returned here on the 23rd. They stayed in Macau for three days and visited Macau Governor Ker Livilla, our diplomatic commissioner to Macau Guo Zefan, the Macau branch of the Kuomintang, Li Bingmi, and various overseas Chinese groups and newspaper offices, who all warmly received them. The Macau Governor told reporters that he was willing to make the greatest efforts to promote friendly relations between China and Portugal and that he would do his best to assist any measures that would benefit China, such as the Sino-Macau Customs Agreement. Our diplomatic commissioner to Macau, Guo Zefan, said that the Macau authorities had recently announced the cancellation of the Chinese Customary Law enacted in 1909, and that starting from the 20th of this month, all administrative matters related to overseas Chinese would be handled in accordance with our country's current laws. Reporters observed for three days and gained a very good impression of the Macau authorities' municipal administration and overseas Chinese relief and charitable undertakings. This time, our currency reform was particularly well received by overseas merchants. Gold prices plunged, falling from 380 Portuguese patacas to 310 Portuguese patacas. Portuguese patacas are still higher than Hong Kong dollars, with one Hong Kong dollar only worth 7 jiao and 8 fen of Portuguese patacas.</p>
<h3>US Warships Passing Through Qingdao Can Exchange Back US Dollars</h3>
<p>The Qingdao National Bank Agrees to Handle the Matter with Flexibility</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 24th] Mayor Gong Xuesui and others went to the US flagship Estes on the morning of the 24th to meet with Vice Admiral Badger to discuss matters related to the exchange of US dollars. Badger ordered all units under his command yesterday that payments should be made after exchanging Gold Yuan notes from the local National Bank first. However, there is one point that needs our flexibility. If a US warship enters the port and returns to the United States after staying for one or two days, the Gold Yuan notes exchanged here cannot be taken back to the United States for use, so it must be exchanged back for US dollars. Regarding this point, Mayor Xi has consulted with Manager Mianzhi of the local National Bank and agreed to handle the matter with flexibility.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Manila Branch Stipulates Gold Yuan Exchange Rate</h3>

<h3>Zhang Lisheng Flies to Tianjin This Morning; Hopes That Holders of Gold and US Dollars in North China Will Actively Exchange; Prices Will Definitely Stabilize After Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Lisheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, who was appointed to supervise economic control in the Tianjin area, arrived in Shanghai last night and is scheduled to fly to Tianjin by plane this morning. Zhang spoke freely about economic reform yesterday, saying that the most important thing at present is that all sectors of society have firm confidence and unanimously support it, so the success of currency reform can be expected. At the same time, the government must also thoroughly implement, seize the opportunity, and advance the four programs in separate ways, connect with each other, and plan comprehensively, without making piecemeal responses. Zhang said that the Economic Control Committee will be established in Beijing soon to coordinate and resolve all technical difficulties. Before the committee is established, anything that society needs or the local government believes should be done should be done quickly without waiting, so as not to miss the opportunity. Regarding the recent rise in retail prices in some places, Zhang believes that the reason is that retailers have not thoroughly understood the government's measures, and this phenomenon is not a cause for concern. He predicts that price fluctuations are still inevitable within two weeks, but they will definitely stabilize in the future, and industry and commerce will be able to develop normally. Zhang expressed optimism about the prospects for promoting economic reform in North China. He also hopes that holders of gold and US dollars in North China will also actively exchange them, showing their patriotic spirit that is not inferior to others. Regarding the supply, distribution, and circulation of materials in North China, Zhang said that he is eager to assist in seeking reasonable solutions under the principle of taking into account both the central and local governments.</p>

<h3>Measures for Managing Trade with Japan Are Gradually Improved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; The Quantity of Export and Import Goods Between the Two Countries Will Be Re-Designated</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce said that recently, the Allied Headquarters in Japan stipulated that the Japanese government's control over export trade will be abolished from the 15th of this month, allowing merchants from various countries to directly trade with Japanese merchants. At the same time, the Japanese government is also allowed to trade with foreign delegations or companies stationed in Japan, while the Allied Headquarters is only in a supervisory and guiding position. In order to adapt to the current trend, our country is planning to gradually improve various management measures regarding trade with Japan. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to relax the number of merchant representatives going to Japan and the length of their stay in Japan. Also, the types and quantities of goods entering and exiting between China and Japan will also be re-produced and ordered according to actual needs. The procedures for reviewing trade plans will be simplified as much as possible, and the quantity restrictions on certain goods will be relaxed or canceled. The procedures for selecting merchant representatives and the necessary procedures for visa registration are also being planned for improvement in order to facilitate merchants and people to promote trade. In addition, after the government promulgated the Measures for Streamlining Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls, various measures for the management of import and export and foreign exchange management of our country will be revised. Various relevant measures for our country's trade with Japan must also be appropriately modified to match the overall trade policy. This amendment is also being carefully reviewed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Third Batch of Private Merchant Representatives</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Asks for Visas to Be Issued for Going to Japan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is notified that the qualifications of the third batch of private merchant representatives, Luo Wenshi, Ma Gengsheng, Pang Yongxuan, Zha Jimin, Jia Qichang, Guo Rizheng, Zhou Linfu, Zheng Jinri, Li Yueqing, Li Yuqing, Ren Yousan, Yang Zhide, Shiguohun, Zhang Fanian, Wu Zulin, Yu Xilou, Zheng Bainian, Xie Rongsheng, and others, have been reviewed and approved by the Trade Guidance Committee for Japan. However, regarding the procedures for these representatives to go abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the government's original quota was 20 people per batch. The previous batch of private merchant representatives stationed in Japan is still conducting trade and has not yet returned home, so it is inconvenient to continue dispatching beyond the quota. It is heard that the Trade Guidance Committee for Japan has reported to the Executive Yuan for approval to relax the quota of private merchants going to Japan and dispatch them once every three months in order to develop trade with Japan and to understand the hardships of merchants. The quota of private merchants going to Japan is limited to 50 to 80 people per batch. Now that the quota has been relaxed, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will immediately send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that it promptly issue passports to the third batch of private merchant representatives in accordance with the new regulations so that private merchants can go to Japan to conduct trade.</p>

<h3>Making a Fortune from Currency Reform</h3>

After a thorough investigation by the government, the name of the speculator has been identified, and a severe punishment will be meted out.</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Appeal on Behalf of Public Servants and Teachers!</h3>
<p>The people have absolute trust in the new currency system after the reform. Only with trust can the nation be saved; only with trust can the people themselves be saved. Otherwise, the nation's future will be bleak, and the people themselves will suffer endlessly. Therefore, today we, the people, have no room for hesitation or doubt regarding the four measures promulgated for emergency economic measures. We should accept them all and resolutely support them.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Wang, in order to "approach balanced revenue and expenditure," in addition to adjusting taxes to increase revenue, is focusing more on reducing the salaries of public servants and teachers to curtail expenditure. This is something that deserves everyone's attention. Increasing revenue and curtailing expenditure are the only ways to manage finances, but increasing revenue must be reasonable, and curtailing expenditure must also be reasonable. Otherwise, the result may not be close but rather distant. In order to earnestly implement the reform plan, we cannot help but make a special appeal on this point on behalf of public servants and teachers!</p>
<p>In the past, the low salaries of public servants and teachers have been criticized. The low work efficiency and the prevalence of corruption and bribery all stem from the excessively low salaries. Now, to achieve the practical effects of economic reform, it is especially necessary to eliminate general malpractices. Because no matter how strict and appropriate the measures are, if public servants cannot even afford to eat enough, and their children cannot afford to go to school, how can we expect them to be effective in their work? If they are ineffective, or perfunctory, or take advantage of the situation, then mere laws will not be able to function on their own. For example, in the collection of taxes, if the execution is effective, so that there are no loopholes and private corruption is eliminated, so that every penny goes to the public, then with the current various taxes, with some adjustments, not only can the balance of revenue and expenditure be approached, but it may even be balanced, or even exceed the pre-war amount. Otherwise, if the income of the tax collectors is not enough to maintain their integrity, the good ones will either starve to death or seek other jobs, and any adjustment will still inevitably fill the pockets of the tax collectors, benefit the unscrupulous merchants who manipulate things from top to bottom, and make the common people suffer from exploitation, and ultimately will not save the emptiness of the national treasury. Guan Zhong's saying, "When clothing and food are sufficient, then one knows honor and shame," is truly an unshakeable conclusion throughout the ages. To expect public servants and teachers to be honest and law-abiding, I am afraid that it cannot be achieved solely by relying on the moral rearmament movement.</p>
<p>According to Article 19 of the Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls: "The salaries of all civil and military public servants and teachers shall be paid in Gold Yuan, with the standard based on the original salary of 40 yuan. For the portion exceeding 40 yuan up to 300 yuan, 20% shall be paid in Gold Yuan. For the portion exceeding 300 yuan, 10% shall be paid in Gold Yuan. Soldiers' salaries and food allowances shall be paid in Gold Yuan in full according to the pre-war amount, without any discount." Article 3 of the same measures states: "The fees for state-owned public utilities and transportation services that are lower than the pre-war standard shall be allowed to be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard. ..." Article 13: "The prices of all kinds of goods and services nationwide shall be sold by converting them into Gold Yuan at the exchange rate based on the prices of various goods in each locality on August 19, 1937, and shall be strictly supervised and enforced by the local competent authorities." If we analyze and summarize these three articles, we are deeply afraid that public servants and teachers will be in a situation where they cannot maintain their livelihoods in the future!</p>
<p>On August 19, the price of rice in legal tender converted to Gold Yuan was twice as high as before the war. Daily necessities such as Longtou fine cloth, pork, cooking oil, and soap have also risen by more than three times, and white newsprint has even risen by more than six times (see the price comparison table of legal tender converted to Gold Yuan in the Shangbao on August 22). If the fees for public utilities and transportation services are successively adjusted according to the pre-war standard, they will at least increase by one time. If the salaries of public servants and teachers are based on the pre-war standard, that is, paid in Gold Yuan in full without any discount, like the salaries of soldiers, it will already require public servants and teachers to shoulder a burden that is twice or more than twice as heavy as before the war. If their salaries are discounted using a progressive system, it will reduce their income by half to three-quarters. On the one hand, income is reduced, and the reduction is so much. On the other hand, expenses are increased, and the increase is so great. If they have no other way to adjust, the general public servants and teachers will only have to work on an empty stomach, let alone support their families. With such important administrative matters entrusted to public servants and teachers with such treatment, how much effort can we expect them to put in? Of course, we hope that one or two sages will emerge, content with poverty, upholding the law, working diligently day and night, and serving the people, but how can we expect everyone to do so? Since the new economic measures were promulgated and implemented, we not only hope that Finance Minister Wang can henceforth approach a balance of revenue and expenditure, but also demand that Finance Minister Wang further balance revenue and expenditure. Because the key to the success of the new currency system lies in the balance of national revenue and expenditure. We demand balanced revenue and expenditure and of course sympathize with Finance Minister Wang's principle of curtailing expenditure, but we really cannot agree with such curtailment for public servants and teachers, for the sake of overall political efficiency and political discipline. In fact, there are many superfluous agencies and redundant personnel in various agencies. If two or three agencies are merged into one in a straightforward manner, and the work that was done by two or three people is completely handed over to one person, and the funds saved are distributed to agencies that really have things to do and personnel who are really working hard, wouldn't Finance Minister Wang's principle of curtailing expenditure still be achieved? When we talk about administrative efficiency, is it better to achieve twice the result with half the effort, or half the result with twice the effort? If you want the horse to be good, but you don't want the horse to eat grass, I am afraid there is no such cheap thing that violates the principles of nature, let alone that public servants and teachers are ultimately human beings!</p>
<p>We absolutely love the country, and we wholeheartedly support the government, so we cherish the economic reform measures promulgated by the government, and we cannot bear to see them die in the hands of public servants who are not fed enough and lack strength. To have the success of economic reform measures, we must cherish Finance Minister Wang, who bears the important responsibility of implementation: to have Finance Minister Wang proceed smoothly with economic reform measures, we must cherish public servants and teachers who perform their duties for the country and the people. In order to cherish public servants and teachers, we must make a sincere appeal on behalf of public servants and teachers regarding the current regulations on treatment! Anyone who is concerned will not consider this appeal to be nonsense!</p>
<h3>Gold Yuan Appears in New Form in Shenyang, Currency System Unified Inside and Outside the Pass, Merchants and People Excited and Competing to Accept It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 24th Dispatch] The general perception of the Gold Yuan in Shenyang is very good, and the belief in it is also more firm than that in the legal tender currency. Everyone is eagerly exchanging and treasuring it out of curiosity. Currently circulating in the market are 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 2 jiao, and 1 jiao denominations, with each bank exchanging 50,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 24th Dispatch] The Gold Yuan appeared in this market on the 23rd in a brand-new form, and merchants and people are competing to accept it with joy and excitement. Wang Zhong, director of the Northeast Branch of the Central Bank, recently told reporters that the advantages of issuing Gold Yuan for the Northeast are the unification of the currency system inside and outside the Pass, and the long-pending issues such as the restrictions on withdrawals and cash withdrawals from the Northeast circulating currency will be easily resolved. He also stated that the number of Gold Yuan notes that the bank has transported in recent days is extremely large, which is sufficient to meet the current needs of the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 24th Dispatch] The impact of the Gold Yuan in the special environment of the Northeast is of concern to economists. The Northeast is isolated by transportation and lacks the most resources. Relying solely on increasing chips is not enough to stabilize prices. The key to the success or failure of the Gold Yuan depends on whether a large number of materials are transported to Shenyang. Secondly, the expansion of the number of circulating notes issued is also quite difficult to recover.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 24th Dispatch] It is learned that although Changchun, which is besieged, has great hopes for the Gold Yuan, due to transportation difficulties, the authorities have decided to temporarily suspend the use of the new currency in Changchun.</p>

Yin Wenjing and Ding Jishi, Directors of the Shandong Finance and Construction Departments, and the Jinan Municipal Government, convened a meeting with the chairmen of various industries at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th and gave detailed instructions on future price issues. In addition, the barbershop, bathhouse, and movie industries in Jinan have increased prices without authorization, which has caused dissatisfaction among the public.

Yin, the honest director, was furious, and from the 24th, they also automatically reduced it to an input of 200 yuan and an output of 210 yuan.</p>

According to Qu Jingzhou, general manager of the Taiwan Bank, although the Taiwan Bank has exchanged a large amount of gold and foreign currency, the outflow of cash is not large, because most of the exchangers still deposit it in the bank. If a large number of banknotes are needed for exchange work in the future, the issuance of currency will inevitably be increased, but it is not included in the issuance quota of Taiwan Province itself, and the method is being requested from the Ministry of Finance.</p>

Regarding the arrest of communist spies among the students of Peking University, President Hu Shi and Commander Chen Jicheng of the Beiping Garrison Command exchanged letters yesterday and today. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) President Hu's letter to Commander Chen: "Mr. Jicheng: Of the fifty Peking University students summoned by the Special Criminal Court this time, other than He Qingxiang and Hu Jide, who do not exist, there are forty-eight. These forty-eight have been thoroughly investigated by responsible senior personnel of the school, with the following results: (1) Six have already reported to the court. (2) One will report to the court immediately. (3) Three were expelled from the school by public announcement on July 21st. (4) It is confirmed that seven have left Beiping and gone south. (5) Two have left the school. (6) Four have already graduated and are employed or interning elsewhere. (7) Twenty-five are not in the dormitories, names omitted. The results of the above investigation have been reported to me in writing by the Dean of Students of Peking University, etc., who take responsibility for them. Dean of Students He Lin said, 'In addition to the dormitory managers reporting that the students in the Sand Beach area are not in their usual dormitories, I, Lin, personally inspected the dormitories in the West Wing, Red Building, and Gray Building last night (the 22nd) in an attempt to find the students and persuade them to go to court to be questioned. I found that none of the students were in their assigned dormitories and could not be found anywhere.' I believe the above report to be absolutely true, so I dare to inform you specifically. We are now investigating students of this school who are in Beiping but avoiding arrest. All will have their student status suspended and will not be allowed to register or reside in the school. I sincerely hope that you and your colleagues will believe my report and guarantee. Respectfully, Hu Shi, July 20th, 37."</p>
<p>(2) Commander Chen's reply to President Hu: "Mr. Shizhi: I have received your letter of the 23rd regarding the matter of the Special Criminal Court summoning students. The security authorities have a responsibility to assist in the execution. We naturally believe that you guarantee that there is no one left among the students of your school who have been summoned except those who have reported to the authorities. According to the report from the responsible officers of the military police, they have entered the school and seen the results of the investigation, which are the same as your investigation. We hope that for students who are confirmed to be not in Beiping, the school will inform them to report to the local court as soon as possible, otherwise they will also be expelled from school. If they or their accomplices engage in activities in the school again, the military police with judicial police duties will go to the school to arrest them at any time according to their duties. This must first be declared to you. Wishing you good health! Chen Jicheng, 24th"</p>

<h3>Stalin Holds Lengthy Talks with Western Envoys; Stalemate on German Question Broken; Optimism for Extension of Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London 24th Broadcast, Reuters: After the British, American, and French envoys held their second meeting with Stalin this morning, a general agreement has been reached, but many specialized issues require further deliberation. When U.S. Ambassador Smith left the Kremlin, he appeared pleased and said, "We will continue to consult." According to a qualified source, "The seven meetings at the Kremlin hold hope for a final agreement. The situation of this meeting has improved compared to the last one, and there is no longer a pessimistic atmosphere." This meeting lasted longer, and both sides adopted a very frank and humble attitude. It is expected that the four powers will soon issue a joint statement.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London 24th Broadcast: According to well-informed White House sources, Stalin proposed some "new ideas" in the meeting on the 24th, which gave hope for breaking the Berlin stalemate. The nature of the "new ideas" has not been revealed, but this new development has completely eliminated the fear that the Berlin talks will break down. At the same time, the extension of the Moscow Conference can at least temporarily avoid the outbreak of a serious international situation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow 24th Dispatch] After the meeting between the three-power envoys and Stalin, British Envoy Roberts told reporters, "We have just held a four-hour and forty-minute meeting with Marshal Stalin and have made good progress. There will be another meeting in the future." However, Roberts did not disclose the date of the next meeting. Last night, Stalin received the envoys of the three countries at the Kremlin at 9:00 PM (Moscow time) and began talks immediately, which ended at 1:40 AM today. Today, the British envoy first made a definite statement on the progress of the Moscow talks to eliminate the fog and general pessimism that have existed since the beginning of the Moscow talks about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Moscow 24th Dispatch] It is reported that Marshal Stalin has eliminated obstacles in the five-hour meeting from the evening of the 23rd to the morning of the 24th, enabling a series of new negotiations on the German question to continue. U.S. Ambassador Smith left the Kremlin at 1:45 AM. He pointed out that Stalin had personally broken the deadlock on the German question, allowing the negotiations to continue, but he refused to disclose what results had been produced in the four-hour and forty-five-minute conversation. A full report of the conversation is being sent to Washington, London, and Paris. Observers believe that new negotiations with Foreign Minister Molotov may be held before the weekend, and Stalin may also participate. The meeting with Stalin on the evening of the 23rd was apparently requested by the Western envoys because they knew that the talks with Molotov alone were approaching a dead end. It is generally believed here that only Stalin can break the deadlock, and this hope is not considered too great. Just before the meeting with Stalin, a farewell cocktail party for Special Envoy Roberts was indeed held at the British Embassy. It is not yet known what concessions Stalin has made to allow the negotiations to continue. But it has long been known that the Western envoys have refused to consider any negotiations on Germany before the Berlin blockade is lifted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 24th Dispatch] Authoritative sources stated on the 24th that the current deadlock in the Moscow talks on lifting the Berlin blockade is due to the Berlin currency issue. Behind this issue is the broader issue of the Western powers' presence in Berlin and having an equal voice. The Western powers are prepared to accept East German Soviet currency as the currency of Berlin, but they insist that this currency must be jointly managed by the four powers within Berlin and not solely by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>U.S. Unofficially Suggests to Soviets: Troops Withdraw from Borders to Ease Current Tensions in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin 24th Dispatch] U.S. military authorities unofficially suggested to the Soviets on the 24th that the troops of the four powers withdraw from the borderlines of the Berlin districts to ease tensions between the Eastern and Western sectors.</p>
<p>This suggestion was delivered by a low-ranking U.S. official to a low-ranking Soviet official. The letter is believed to have been delivered to Major General Kotikov, the Soviet military commander in Berlin, and has been approved by senior U.S. military authorities. According to the above suggestion, German police from the three districts will be allowed to patrol border areas without the supervision and assistance of occupying power military police. According to the most well-informed sources, if a favorable response is obtained, an agreement will be formally established. At the same time, due to the Soviet side's compromising attitude, the British side will also release Lebedev, a senior Soviet official of the Soviet-controlled Berlin radio station, who was arrested on the 23rd for entering the British sector.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin 23rd Dispatch] Soviet officials released three Americans, one Briton, and five Germans on the 23rd. Immediately afterwards, the Soviet army arrested a German photographer in the U.S. sector. Shortly afterwards, Lebedev was arrested in the British sector for speeding.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin 24th Dispatch] The tense situation caused by the Soviet army setting up roadblocks in Potsdamer Platz has apparently eased today. Although the Soviet army crossed the border again on the evening of the 23rd, the U.S. side said it was accidental. According to U.S. sources, several Soviet patrolmen entered the U.S. sector near the Erhardt Barracks south of Potsdamer Platz, but did not interfere with anyone and did not arrest anyone when they left. It is generally believed that their border crossing was due to a failure to notice.</p>
<h3>West German Constitution Draft Completed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Frankfurt 23rd Dispatch] The drafting committee appointed by the premiers of the eleven West German states has now completed the draft of the West German government's constitution. It is reported that the constitution stipulates that a central parliament shall be produced by universal suffrage, including 400 representatives from the West German states and 20 representatives from Berlin. In addition, a Senate will be created by representatives of the state governments. The government's executive body will be divided into ten departments, with a Chairman of the Council of Ministers. State governments will be responsible for constitutional and administrative matters, while the central government will be responsible for foreign affairs, transportation, and communications.</p>
<h3>Berlin City Elections: Soviets Order Postponement to Autumn Next Year; Western Occupied Sectors Will Make Statement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin 24th Dispatch] Soviet occupation commander Sokolovsky today ordered the postponement of Berlin's autumn elections by one year. Observers immediately interpreted his action as acknowledging that the Soviet Union's position had been weakened by the Berlin blockade. Sokolovsky issued a communique stating that, due to repeated requests from labor groups and party leaders, the election will be postponed to the autumn of 1949. Sokolovsky's unilateral decision will have no effect on the three sectors occupied by the four powers, and it is generally expected that the Western countries will make a statement regarding the Soviet decision. The Berlin autumn elections have long been a focus of political contention. This is the first Berlin city election since the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party won 20 percent of the vote in the autumn of 1946. The three main anti-communist parties have submitted a joint proposal to the city council demanding that the elections be held as scheduled on October 24, and the city council is scheduled to discuss it at a general meeting on the 26th.</p>

Diplomatic officials said that the United States has become deeply aware of the seriousness of the communist bandit rebellion in Malaya.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Government in Korea Announces End; U.S. Occupation Troops Will Not Withdraw; Hodge Returns to U.S., Muccio Becomes Supreme Representative</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 23rd Dispatch] The United States has formally announced the end of its military occupation in Korea. General Hodge is transferring his duties, etc., to Ambassador Muccio. Since Lee Seungman became the President of Korea on August 15 and the United States recognized Korea, it was widely believed that the United States would take this measure. Muccio will be given the title of Senior U.S. Representative to Korea. This means that the government in the form of a three-year military occupation has come to an end, but it does not mean that all U.S. troops will withdraw. They will remain in Korea to assist the new government.</p>
<p>Former Deputy Commander of the U.S. Military Government in Korea, Coulter, will succeed Hodge. Hodge's new assignment order has not yet been announced. He has been ordered to report to the Army Headquarters in Washington first. President Truman wrote to Hodge, saying, "The establishment of the South Korean government has ended your difficult mission. The transfer of power in Korea to its own people will certainly satisfy you, and our government is also very satisfied." Secretary of the Army Royal and Chief of Staff Bradley also congratulated Hodge. Hodge has lived abroad for six years, except for one trip home last year. He has been in Korea since the end of the war against Japan. The State Department announced that Muccio's mission will be to negotiate the training of new Korean soldiers, transfer the property of the occupation forces to the Korean government, and transfer the former Japanese property to Korea. Building a new army in Korea in addition to the police organization will also be within the plan to establish a security force within the United Nations. State Department and Army Department officials have frankly stated that U.S. troops will remain in Korea as long as the U.S. and Korea believe that the U.S. occupation forces can resist the Soviet-trained North Korean army. It is estimated that there are about 125,000 Soviet-trained North Korean troops, and the South Korean police are estimated to have 26,000. The informal estimate of U.S. troops is about 23,000. In addition, Muccio must be responsible for merging the former occupation expenses with the Economic Cooperation Administration. The State Department announced that Muccio will negotiate a bilateral agreement with Lee Seungman to bring the aid program to Korea into the aid program to China. The aid fund for Korea is the unspent occupation fee allocated by Congress to the Army Department, totaling about 100 million U.S. dollars. Muccio's problems also include the electricity dispute with the Soviet commander in North Korea, Mogulov. Although the Korean government will also participate, Muccio will provide assistance.</p>

<h3>America's Misstep Regarding the German Situation</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Shi</p>
<p>What follows is an article about how the United States relinquished its military advantage in Germany. The original article was published in the July 23rd issue of "U.S. News &amp; World Report."</p>
<p>As World War II was coming to an end, the American offensive into Germany was very strong, and capturing Berlin would not have been difficult. However, the United States did not attack Berlin in order to honor military treaties. At that time, American forces had penetrated deeply into Czechoslovakia, and the area they occupied, plus the areas occupied by British, French, and other Allied forces, was much larger than present-day West Germany. As a result, the United States, in order to abide by the treaties, handed over all the extra territory it had occupied to the Soviet Union. Although Berlin remained under Allied occupation, this created the precedent for the Berlin problem and the German problem of today.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's coercion of the United States, Britain, and France in Berlin stems from the abandonment of a favorable position at that time. The fact is that if there had been no wartime treaty provisions during World War II, American forces could have occupied Berlin much earlier. Because of the wartime treaty provisions, Berlin had to be left for the Soviets to conquer. At the same time, a large portion of German territory occupied by American troops was given to the Soviet Union as the price for the American forces' advance on Berlin.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union allowed British and American Allied forces to enter Berlin, there was no explicit agreement regarding the West's unlimited access to and from Berlin. Therefore, the Soviet Union, due to its territorial and power advantages, was able to have the power to blockade Western transportation routes to Berlin today. General Clay, the commander of the American forces stationed in Germany, once engaged in negotiations regarding the German problem. However, the result of the negotiations was to promote the Soviet Union's establishment of the Iron Curtain and its control over the supply lines to Berlin. The reason why the United States abandoned its original advantageous position in Germany after the end of the war was entirely voluntary. The following are the facts that occurred.</p>
<p>In 1945, when American troops arrived at the outskirts of Berlin, they stopped their advance. This was due to America's desire to abide by the treaty. In mid-April 1945, American troops reached Magdeburg along the Elbe River, a place only fifty miles away from Berlin. They also established bridgeheads, preparing to cross the river. The American commanders also knew that it would be easier to attack Berlin from there, and both the German troops and the people of Berlin hoped that the Western forces would be the first to capture the city, because they believed that the Western forces would be more benevolent than the Soviet troops. Despite these advantages, the American vanguard remained stationed in the Elbe River region and did not advance.</p>
<p>General Marshall, who was then the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, reported to the U.S. military that "The Elbe River is the agreed-upon limit of the American advance with the Soviet Union." Indeed, this kind of regulation was good in order to avoid confusion when Western and Soviet troops met. The American troops waited for a long time before the Soviet troops arrived and surrounded Berlin. By the time they had extinguished the last resistance, it was already May 1st. The American troops had waited a full two weeks.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, under the military treaty, the only places where the Soviet Union allowed American troops to be stationed were Thuringia and Saxony, so the vast area was entirely under the control of Soviet troops. The issue of the Soviet occupation zone was already stipulated during the London Conference on September 12, 1944, and the subsequent Yalta Conference, in consultations between President Roosevelt, Marshal Stalin, and Prime Minister Churchill.</p>
<p>At the beginning of World War II, Germany had occupied Czechoslovakia. Later, in order to prevent the Sudetenland area of the Bohemian Mountains from becoming an "inner fortress" for the Germans to resist the Allied forces, the American troops swept through the area. On May 6th, when American troops were only fifty miles away from Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, they stopped their advance again. Later, Soviet troops belatedly conquered Prague and boasted greatly that they had "liberated" Czechoslovakia. In Austria, American troops also advanced until the German commander in Austria surrendered to the American Sixth Army on May 6th, at which point the advance stopped.</p>
<p>After Germany's defeat, the United States, eager to reach a conclusion at the Potsdam Conference in July of that year, which was attended by President Truman, Marshal Stalin, and Prime Minister Churchill, gave up its disputable rights in Berlin. After Soviet troops entered Berlin, in order to expand their occupation area, they allowed the United States, Britain, and France to enter Berlin, dividing Berlin into four occupation zones: British, American, French, and Soviet. The American troops only obtained the right to occupy Berlin, but handed over the three hundred miles from the Czech border to Vitebsk to the Soviet troops according to the agreement. The British troops also handed over the area from Vitebsk to the Baltic Sea to the Soviet troops according to the agreement. At that time, the four powers assumed that they could have normal transportation rights to the Berlin occupation zone.</p>
<p>On June 14, 1945, President Truman first notified Stalin, proposing that if the military commanders in Germany had reached a satisfactory agreement on matters concerning Berlin, then American troops could immediately withdraw to their original occupation zones. Stalin agreed to Truman's proposal at that time.</p>
<p>In mid-June, the Soviet commander in Germany, Zhukov, hosted the American and British delegations at the Soviet headquarters in Berlin. The chairman of the American delegation at that time was General Clay, and the representative from the State Department was Murphy. The American and British representatives proposed that the West should have various transportation facilities to and from Berlin, but Zhukov refused. The Soviet side only suggested implementing the previous treaty, ordering the military commanders of the four countries to have supreme rights within their respective occupation zones.</p>
<p>Regarding the basic treaty on Berlin, the only thing accepted by General Clay and the Western delegations was the "corridor" for transportation to Berlin. This treaty was signed on June 29, 1945. As a result, the right to control Western land and water transportation to Berlin remained in the hands of the Soviet Union. The free access proposed by the United States only received verbal permission from the Soviet side, without any explicit agreement. At that time, the United States and Britain withdrew from the original Soviet-occupied area, and the Western Allied forces entered the city of Berlin.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, what is currently being encountered is a dispute over transportation between Berlin and the West. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France hope that the Soviet Union can lift its blockade of transportation to Berlin, but the Soviet Union has not given the Western powers any document allowing free transportation between the West and Berlin. Therefore, it seems that unless the United Kingdom, the United States, and France make concessions to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is unlikely to ease its pressure to force the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to withdraw from Berlin.</p>
<h3>A New War Brews in the Holy Land: Jewish Side Claims Arab Forces Have Concentrated on the Border of the Holy Land; Arab Allied Forces and Iraqi Forces Decide to Unify Command</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 24th] An Israeli military spokesman on the 24th condemned the Arabs for carrying out new war preparations within Transjordan. At the same time, the Arab Allied Forces and the Iraqi Forces have declared that they have merged under a unified command. According to a notification issued from Amman, the capital of Transjordan, King Abdullah's Arab Allied Forces and the Iraqi Forces have agreed on the 22nd to unify their command. These negotiations have been going on for several days. The above agreement was signed in the palace, and King Abdullah personally presided over the meeting. The Arab Allied Forces are the largest army in the Middle East. Their supply depends on Britain's $8 million grant to Transjordan. Lieutenant General Glubb, the commander of the Allied Forces, is currently in Britain discussing this year's grant. The Israeli government said that it received reports last week that Cookgy had resigned from his position as commander of the "Army for the Liberation of the People of Palestine." This army includes volunteers from all over the Arab world and is led by Syria and Iraq. It is currently fighting in Palestine. The Israeli military spokesman here said that a considerable degree of war preparations is underway at the joint Iraqi-Transjordanian base of Muweilah, a few miles from the Palestinian border. It is said that troops and vehicles have been concentrated there over the past week. In the past few days, Arab irregulars, aided by Iraqi artillery, have shelled the Rei'ain area, a few miles east of Tel Aviv, but the Israeli army has not retaliated. According to other sources, Israeli forces shelled Tel Radar in Rechitzvim, while the Arab Allied Forces shelled the Jewish residential area of ​​Kiser.</p>

<h3>Three Prisoners Escape from Shanghai Prison; Ring Leader of Gold Bar Case Breaks Free; Cutting Iron Bars in the Rain, They Flee Together; Chen Yuansheng, Arrested Two Years Ago</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 1 AM yesterday morning, three important theft criminals escaped from Shanghai Prison. One of them was Chen Yuansheng, the ring leader of the Central Bank gold bar case who was sentenced to life imprisonment two years ago. The other two thieves were Jiang Jixiang and Wang Hailiang. The former was sentenced to seven years in prison, and the latter was sentenced to four years in prison. By the time it was discovered, they had already fled without a trace. Afterwards, two hacksaws, one pair of pliers, one hammer, and one piece of lead wire were found, proving that the escape was premeditated and had been planned for a long time.</p>
<p>Before the three criminals escaped, they were all assigned to work as orderlies at the prison hospital and slept together in a room in the southwest corner of the fifth floor. In addition, another thief named Liu Aliou lived in the same room. Because he was sentenced to four years and was about to be released, he did not want to take the risk and stayed behind. It was found that the prison cell on the fifth floor has a flat balcony railing outside. Whenever it is opened, prisoners always use it to dry bedding and wash. Therefore, every morning, they took advantage of the convenience of drying blankets on the railing to secretly use a hacksaw to gradually cut through one of the iron bars. At the same time, they gradually stole and retained scattered gauze bandages from the hospital and made twenty-four rope strands. Then, they divided the strands and made two thick ropes, each thirteen feet long. When all preparations were completed, the three criminals took advantage of the gray sky and sudden downpour yesterday morning to begin their operation. They further discovered that there was no one in the southeast corner watchtower, so they successively climbed down the leaking water pipe like monkeys through the gap of the sawn-off railing. After reaching the bottom floor, the watchtower doors and windows were tightly closed. They then used a hacksaw to cut off the iron lock, jumped through the window, and walked to the second floor again. From a window without iron bars, they tied the rope made of gauze and climbed down to the square outside the prison. This place is also the execution ground where thieves are executed each time. Afterwards, they crossed the low wall and disappeared into Kunming Road.</p>
<p>It was not until approximately 3 AM that Kong Xiangyu, a member of the guard section, went to inspect the prison and discovered this matter. He reported it to the section chief, who reported it to the military and police agencies overnight, and a joint investigation is underway.</p>
<h3>August 19th Prices to Be Announced Today; Social Bureau Convenes Discussion Meeting; Urging All Industries to Voluntarily Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the currency reform, general prices have been quite stable, but daily food items such as vegetables and fresh meat still fluctuate. In order to implement the central government's order that prices must not exceed those of August 19th, the Social Bureau convened a price review meeting at 10 AM yesterday, presided over by Director Wu himself. Those present included Gu Bingyuan, director of the Economic Administration Department; Zhang Chude, chief of the Price Management Section; Cheng Yikuan of the Police Bureau; Ling Xuyou and Wang Zhenhuan of the Health Bureau; and those in charge of various industries such as fruits, local products, department stores, global department stores, beef and mutton, fresh pork, chicken and duck, fish, vegetables, and soy sauce. Director Wu declared that the central government is determined to suppress prices this time and ordered the Social, Police, Finance, and Health Bureaus to jointly implement it. He instructed the various industries to immediately reduce the raised prices from today and all to convert them to gold yuan coupons according to the prices of August 19th. The Social Bureau will announce the standards for various prices in various markets today. Those who exceed the limit will be severely punished. Those with serious circumstances will be transferred to the special criminal court for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Pays Attention to Pork Prices</h3>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, according to a report by a representative of the pig slaughtering industry, the wholesale price on the 19th was 1.8 million to 1.9 million yuan per catty, and the current price is 1.9 million to 2.1 million yuan. As for the retail price exceeding 3 million yuan, the retailer should be responsible. However, after the representative finished reporting, Zhang, the chief of the Social Bureau, pointed out that the wholesale price on the 19th was not 1.9 million yuan, but only 1.4 million yuan. A representative of the Finance Bureau also proved that the bureau collected taxes based on 1.6 million yuan. Therefore, the market price of 1.9 million yuan on the 19th was already problematic. And retailers raising the price to 3 million yuan is an illegal profit, and the Social Bureau is paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau is scheduled to convene the persons in charge of the ice-fresh, fresh fish, sea cucumber transportation and sales industries and the vendors' associations tomorrow morning to give instructions on price issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after sending representatives to the Social Bureau's price review meeting yesterday, the Fish Market decided to notify relevant parties in the fish industry to earnestly comply with government regulations, and all fish sales must not exceed the prices of August 19th, and to investigate and list the transaction prices of various types of fish in the market on that day for unified compliance.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Capital Plan; Banking Industry to Discuss Again Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to study how to adjust capital issues under the new currency system, the banking industry in this city had previously convened a group discussion by the Banking Association.

<h3>Cigarettes and Porcelain Increase in Price; Social Bureau Orders to Stop</h3>
<p>According to Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Bureau, cigarettes generally increased in price by 10% yesterday, and the porcelain industry association also requested a 10% price increase from the Social Bureau.

<h3>Hai Liao Ship Sails to Kobe Today; Will Load Back Seized Auxiliary Coins</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Liao ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Kobe for the third time this afternoon at 5 PM to transport exchange materials. On the return trip, it will load compensation and returned materials from Sasebo and Osaka to return to the country. It is reported that the returned materials from Osaka are copper-nickel coins that were seized during the war, in very large quantities. This time, the Hai Liao ship will load 1,800 tons first.</p>
<h3>Public Education Allotments; Decided to Supply Free of Charge</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from the Municipal Public Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee: For the August public education personnel's various daily necessities, in addition to the rice item, which has already been exempted from collection, the remaining coal briquettes will be collected at 11,000 yuan in legal tender per market dan, cooking oil will be collected at 1,800 yuan in legal tender per market catty, salt will be collected at 2,000 yuan in legal tender per market catty, and soy sauce will be collected at 400 yuan in legal tender per market catty. After converting to gold yuan coupons, the amount is odd and inconvenient to calculate. Yesterday, it was decided to cancel the charges starting from August and report to the Executive Yuan for record. Before the central government has clear regulations, the association will continue to prepare to print and issue purchase certificates for September.</p>
<h3>First Complaint; Citizen Reports to City Council; Mao Da Long Illegally Raises Prices</h3>
<p>In order to assist the government in promoting the currency reform policy, the City Council has decided to mobilize public opinion to openly report and severely punish unscrupulous merchants who illegally raise prices to seek violent profits. The Council has already accepted the first complaint filed by citizen Yao Youfan yesterday, reporting that Mao Da Long Food Shop on Shaanxi South Road illegally raised prices. It is reported that the shop sells White Pagoda brand cream produced by Shanghai Asian Cheese Company. On the 19th, it originally sold for 10 million yuan in legal tender per pound. After the issuance of gold yuan coupons, it suddenly raised the price to 4 yuan per pound in gold yuan coupons. In addition to taking the market price on the 19th as the standard, the Council will inspect illegal price increases in various industries at any time and send them to the authorities for punishment, hoping that citizens will work together to expand the scope of reporting.</p>
<h3>Arresting Vegetable Vendors; One Hundred People Punished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In addition to monitoring various industries and markets throughout the day yesterday, the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade and a part of the police officers from each police sub-bureau surveyed the general selling prices in the vegetable market in the morning. All vegetable vendors found to have exceeded the market price on the 19th were arrested and detained in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 3 of the Price Restriction and Price Negotiation Punishment Regulations. It is reported that a total of 76 illegal vegetable vendors were arrested in Huangpu District yesterday, and approximately 20 others in other police sub-bureaus, totaling approximately 100 people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Cao Su Gong stationery store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road was found by the relevant police sub-bureau to have retail prices that greatly exceeded the market price on the 19th. The store owner was arrested and sent to the Economic Section of the Main Bureau for legal punishment of a 5 yuan gold yuan fine and detention for two days as a warning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Budget; Discuss Revising; Seeking to Make Up for Municipal Financial Deficit; Possible Increase in House Tax and Land Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government Accounting Office convened a meeting of the secretaries, directors, and accounting directors of the Municipal Government Bureaus and Departments at 10 AM yesterday to discuss the principles of revising the budget. The meeting was presided over by Min Xiangfan, director of the Accounting Office. The resolutions made at the meeting were: (1) When the bureaus and departments prepare the budget from September 1st to December 31st, all business expenses should be converted into gold yuan coupons according to the original amount, with the principle that the original amount should not be exceeded. Therefore, it is actually a revision of the budget rather than a re-compilation. (2) Employee salaries and allowances will be prepared in accordance with the regulations of the central government, but the number of personnel will not be increased. The principles for employee office expenses were agreed upon as follows: 3 yuan in gold yuan coupons for staff, 3 jiao for workers. Special office expenses will be decided at the Municipal Administration Meeting. (3) Revenue departments will also be revised at the same time. If various tax rates are lower than those before the war, they may be increased as necessary to make up for the municipal financial deficit. Revenue is divided into two parts: A. Fixed-price revenue will be determined with reference to pre-war standards; B. Ad valorem revenue will be converted according to the standards of July and August. The new budgets of each bureau and department are limited to being submitted to the Accounting Office today. After compilation, they will be submitted to the Municipal Administration Meeting for approval the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Fury; Gauze Prices Fluctuate Again; Orders Submission of Transaction Records for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the various industries and markets were generally stable, but the price of cotton yarn and cloth increased by more than 15% compared to the previous day. After hearing this, Mayor Wu was furious and telegraphed Police Chief Yu Shuping at 5:30 PM, ordering him to immediately summon the chairmen of the two industry associations, Tang Zhiliang and Dong Jiufeng, to state the reasons for the increase and order them to submit all the transaction records of the brokers of the two industries yesterday for investigation of the buyers. If price increases or speculative manipulation are found, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Standards · Strive for · Fairness</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Government revised the budget, the wages and salaries of employees increased in accordance with central government regulations, resulting in a monthly shortfall of 2 million yuan. Therefore, a detailed study is being carried out on increasing tax rates to balance revenue and expenditure. According to Director Tian of the Finance Bureau, the current house tax is extremely low. If converted into gold yuan coupons, it is still less than one fen, which is indeed unreasonable. Therefore, it may be appropriately increased, but it is currently under consideration and has not yet been decided. When the reporter asked what the standard would be if the house tax were increased, he replied that it would be done as fairly as possible. It was found that the house tax during the former Public Works Bureau era adopted a valuation system, with taxes ranging from approximately 15% to 18%, while the central government's regulations stipulated 20%, which is even higher. Therefore, it would be fairer to refer to the era of the former Public Works Bureau. However, Director Tian stated that no decision has been made yet and that it must be submitted to the Municipal Administration Meeting this Friday for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3>Tian Chan and Other Two Theaters; Ticket Prices Exceed Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Bureau has restricted theater ticket prices in this city to convert to gold yuan coupons according to the prices of August 19th. Tian Chan Stage and Gong Stage converted the ticket price of 3 million yuan into 1 yuan and 2 jiao in gold yuan, which exceeded 2 jiao (600,000 yuan). The Social Bureau summoned the persons in charge of the two stages yesterday and instructed them to comply with the laws and regulations. The Peking Opera Association hopes that when inviting famous actors to perform, the ticket prices can be reasonably adjusted. The Social Bureau agreed to handle it after approval. The person in charge of the Film Industry Association was also summoned to the Social Bureau yesterday and agreed to convert to gold yuan coupons according to the prices of August 19th, rounding off the fractions. As for the dance hall tea charges, the Social Bureau is also reviewing them and will announce them within a few days.</p>
<h3>Wage Calculation Issues; Assessment Committee to Discuss Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Labor-Management Assessment Committee is scheduled to convene a general meeting at 3 PM tomorrow to discuss the wage calculation issues after the currency reform.</p>
<h3>Storing One Month's Worth of Ship Coal; Ministry of Industry and Commerce Orders Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report, Nanjing, 24th] The National Federation of Shipping Industry Associations believes that the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee has been revoked, and the supply of coal for ships should be planned in advance to avoid the shortage of coal supply. The suggestions are: (1) Store 20,000 tons of ship coal for one month; (2) The required coal price is 1.7 trillion yuan, and request the knowledge of the Four Joint Offices to provide national policy loans. Based on this, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has ordered the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee to quickly review the matter of storing 20,000 tons of ship coal for one month. As for the required coal price of 1.7 trillion yuan, if the review shows it is necessary, the request should be approved, and a document has been submitted to the Executive Yuan to transfer the decision to the Four Joint Offices for handling, so as to facilitate coal storage.</p>
<h3>Supporting the New Currency and Eradicating Communist Spies: All Sectors Hold a Propaganda Rally</h3>
<p>The propaganda rally of all sectors in the city supporting the government's currency reform and eradicating communist spies was held at the Tianchan Stage yesterday at 9:30 AM. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Fang Zhi, Yu Hongjun (represented by Fan Heyan), Zhang Fang, Shu Yunzhang, Xu Jiqing, Youth Party city party representative Yu Kang, guests from all walks of life, and over two thousand citizens attended. Mayor Wu, as chairman of the presidium, delivered an impromptu speech, briefly stating: "The people's suffering during the War of Resistance against Japan and the period of suppressing the communist rebellion stems from inflation, especially recently. In view of this, the government, in order to solve the people's livelihood and stability, resolutely reformed the currency system before the communist rebellion was completely quelled, with the aim of alleviating the people's suffering as soon as possible. The characteristics of this currency reform are: (1) The gold yuan has full reserves, and the people can completely trust it. (2) All regulations are extremely clear, and there is a fixed exchange rate. Therefore, we hope that citizens holding gold, silver, and foreign currency will quickly exchange them. Those who fail to do so will be punished by law. At the same time, we hope that all sectors of industry and commerce will assist the government in suppressing prices and stabilizing the people's livelihood."</p>
<p>To Stabilize Prices, Currency Reform Is Essential</p>
<p>After Mr. Wu finished his speech, Liang Ying, Zhang Lu, Jenny Danny, Li Xueying, Zhang Ming, Xiao Lu, Bai Ying, Mei Qi, Zhou Lihua, Xiao Pu, Zheng Yun, Pei Lan, and Pan Qihua, fourteen female singers from the city who had recently flown to the Xuzhou area to慰劳 the air force, sang a self-composed song called "Supporting the Government's Currency Reform and Eradicating Communist Spies", modeled after the song "Welcoming Warriors." Then, Fan Heyan, representing President Yu of the National Bank, delivered a speech, clarifying the government's decision to reform the currency system. Mr. Fan said, "To stabilize the people's livelihood, we must stabilize prices. To stabilize prices, we must reform the currency system. Only in this way can fiscal revenue and expenditure be balanced, and inflation can be avoided." Finally, Mr. Fan gave a detailed explanation and description of the essence and characteristics of the four measures of the new plan.</p>
<p>Disrupting Social Order Is No Different from Aiding the Communists</p>
<p>Speaker Pan, in his speech, considered the communists and the selfish nouveau riche to be "our common enemies. Because the actions of the selfish and self-serving are disrupting the financial system and destroying social order, which is no different from aiding the communists, we should thoroughly eradicate them and cannot coexist with them." Mr. Pan also cited Tito of Yugoslavia as evidence, hoping that citizens would assist the government in reporting hidden communist spies within their own occupations, residences, and living circles, so that citizens can live and work in peace and contentment due to social stability. Mr. Pan continued, "Prices can be lowered, but the key lies in our hearts. The government's new economic plan is the key to unlocking this. If we can trust the gold yuan as if it were a material object, then the psychology of hoarding currency being better than hoarding goods can make prices fall, without a doubt."</p>
<p>Supporting Currency Reform Is the Only Way to Stabilize Life</p>
<p>Chairman Fang, in his speech, briefly stated: "Only by eradicating communist spies in the rear can we eliminate the communist conspiracy; by helping the front lines to suppress the communists, we can stabilize the social order in our rear; only by supporting the government's currency reform and complying with all laws and regulations can we stabilize life, stabilize the financial system, eliminate communist bandits, engage in construction, and revive the nation." Subsequently, Yu Kang, representative of the Youth Party city party, and Zhang Fang, head of the Central Plains慰劳 Delegation, delivered speeches. After the speeches, Chairman Fang, on behalf of the National慰劳 Headquarters, awarded commemorative medals to the慰劳ing singers. The assembly also passed the "Shanghai All Sectors Supporting the Government's Currency Reform and Eradicating Communist Spies Telegram" and the "Shanghai All Sectors' Dedication of慰劳ing Words to the Central Plains Soldiers." The proceedings of yesterday's meeting were broadcast by all radio stations in the city, and China Film Studio sent personnel to the venue to film newsreels. The meeting adjourned at approximately 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Airplanes Distribute Leaflets, Personnel Sent Out for Propaganda</p>
<p>In order to widely promote and support the government's currency reform and eradicate communist spies, in addition to holding a grand propaganda rally at the Tianchan Stage in the morning, the Air Force Command also sent planes to distribute a large number of small leaflets. The political work brigade of the Suppression of Communist Rebellion Propaganda Headquarters also dispatched 150 team members, divided into fifteen propaganda teams, who braved the rain throughout the day to go to various theaters, dance halls, teahouses, and public places throughout the city to promote the significance of supporting the government's currency reform and eradicating communist spies.</p>

<h3>Aftermath of the Mesber Case: Petition to Return Gold and Banknotes Rejected by the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] In the case of "Foreign Tiger" Mesber's black market gold and banknote trading, Mesber himself has already left China. The Abbott Company in this city had petitioned the court to return the large amount of gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars confiscated in the case. After being rejected, the company appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court recently ruled that the "appeal is rejected," and the confiscation of the gold and banknotes has been finalized.</p>
<h3>Yu Shuping and Others Indicted: Decision Not to Prosecute</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Chen Weida, owner of the Weida Hotel in this city, previously filed a complaint with the Suzhou District Prosecutor's Office against Police Chief Yu Shuping and others for alleged abuse of power. The Suzhou District Prosecutor's Office has now ruled not to prosecute. The decision not to prosecute has been sent to the District Prosecutor's Office in this city for delivery. The decision not to prosecute states that Yu and others' violations of police regulations, due to detention exceeding the time limit, are classified as police violations, and in addition to administrative legal responsibilities, no criminal issues arise. As for Yu being instigated by Chen Bangqian to use his authority to carry out coercion, because the recorded statements were the result of a mutually agreed mediation, it is also not established, and there is insufficient evidence of a crime. Therefore, the decision is not to prosecute.</p>

<h3>Forced to Join the Communist Army: Zhao Shuhe Surrenders Himself</h3>
<p>Communist bandit Zhao Shuhe, 29 years old, from Changdianba, Zhejiang, recently surrendered himself to the city police station. According to his confession: Four years ago, he was forced to join the New Fourth Army. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he served as the deputy manager in Liu Gongsi Zu of the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu. Recently, because he opposed the Communist bandits' feudal separatist ways, he could not bear the coercion and fled to Shanghai.

The city police station has now approved his self-renewal and provided him with travel expenses to return to his hometown.</p>

<h3>Illegal Cotton Yarn Transactions Off-Exchange: Two Brokers Publicly Prosecuted; Clients Entrusting Sales Also Indicted</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhang Xinggen and Xu Yuesheng, two cotton yarn brokers who were arrested by the Garrison Command for engaging in off-exchange transactions, were previously paraded through the streets with their crimes written on wooden signs and escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The case has now been concluded after several investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office. According to Zhang's confession: On June 29, he was entrusted off-market to twice sell 21-count Shuangma cotton yarn for Tang Yuanjie, manager of Yongle Cloth Factory, to Feng Chaoheng, manager of Hengfeng Yarn Company. On the same day, Xu was also entrusted at a tea party to sell two pieces of 10-count Flying Tiger yarn for Sun Qijun's Huaxing Ribbon Factory to Lu Wenxiang, manager of Xiangji Yarn Company. On the 30th, he was again commissioned to sell one piece of 20-count Shuiyue yarn for Xu Hanchen's Mingxing Bedsheet Factory to Shi Xianglin, manager of Maosheng Electric Weaving Factory, and two pieces of 20-count Honglian yarn for Hu Xiushan's Weiguang Cloth Factory to Hengyu Yarn Company. Since both men were guilty of buying and selling cotton yarn outside the market, they were prosecuted in accordance with Articles 38, Paragraph 3, and 53 of the revised Exchange Law. The remaining defendants who entrusted the purchases were all oral transactions involving speculative buying and selling and were also prosecuted in accordance with Article 53 of the revised Exchange Law.</p>
<h3>Rent Standards Should Be Frozen; Any Attempt to Increase Them Is a Disruption of Economic Measures; Emergency Meeting of the Tenants' Association</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Tenants' General Association of this city held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday. During the meeting, they expressed their indignation at the restoration of pre-war rent standards, unanimously believing that rents should also be frozen in accordance with the central government's regulations, and should not exceed the prices of August 19. Because all tenants' monthly salaries have also been frozen since the currency reform, how can rents be allowed to increase dozens of times? They unanimously passed a resolution that anyone attempting to increase rents opportunistically after the currency reform is disrupting the government's economic emergency measures and should be brought to the government's attention.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation Advocates No Price Increases for State-Run Transportation Enterprises; Steamboat Industry Representatives Return to Shanghai After Seeking Instructions in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Steamboat Industry Association intended to adjust fares according to pre-war standards. The industry representatives Li Youliang and others, together with Wu Shiyuan and Sun Guang of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to Beijing the other day with a table of pre-war and post-war freight rate ratios, petitioning the Ministry of Transportation for approval. The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to sources: The Minister of Transportation believes that at the beginning of the issuance of gold yuan, state-run transportation enterprises should not raise prices to avoid stimulating prices. Therefore, Minister Yu advocated that steamboat freight rates, railway bureau rates, and air freight rates should all maintain their original prices. The part of the losses due to insufficient revenue and expenditure should still be subsidized by the government for a short period, and then improvements should be gradually sought. As for postal and telecommunications prices, they will be decided after the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Pan Chaoying and Others Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Discussing the Serious Confrontation Between North and South Korea</p>
<p>Pan Chaoying and Wang Haoming, representing the National Foreign Relations Association of our country and the Catholic Cultural Promotion Association to celebrate the establishment of the Korean government, flew from Shanghai to Seoul on the evening of the 12th of this month to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Korean president on the 15th. On the 19th, they transferred to Tokyo to investigate the general situation in Japan, which has now been completed. They returned to the country on a Northwest Airlines flight yesterday morning, arriving in Shanghai at about 1:00 PM. Mr. Pan is scheduled to fly to Guangzhou this morning for official business. Mr. Wang will return to Beijing today. This reporter interviewed Mr. Pan at his residence last night, and he talked about his impressions of this trip, saying: "The Korean people and the government place extremely high expectations on our country. The most noteworthy thing at present is that the North Korean communists have established close ties with the Northeast communists in our country. Among the Northeast communists, 60,000 to 70,000 Korean communists are participating in the war, and within North Korea, 40,000 to 50,000 armed Chinese communists have infiltrated. The confrontation between North and South Korea is becoming increasingly serious, and there is a possibility of internal turmoil after three months. However, everything still depends on the United Nations General Assembly's handling of the Korean issue. North Korean youths are actively launching anti-communist movements. Recently, 50,000 to 60,000 members of the North Korean 'Communist Youth League' fled to South Korea and established the 'Northwest Youth League' to carry out anti-communist propaganda and actions. The South Korean people do not have any ill feelings towards the US military, but because the US military inevitably has racial discrimination towards Koreans, it has also aroused dissatisfaction among Koreans."</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] After the currency reform and the appearance of the gold yuan, the customs gold banknotes that had not been around for long stopped printing, and the workers of the Central Printing Factory, which printed legal tender, suddenly felt panic about unemployment.

<h3>Murder Case in the Yarn and Cloth Building: Servant of a Company Dies from Fists</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhu Huagou, from Chongming, worked as a servant in a certain company on the second floor of the Yarn and Cloth Building at 260 Zhongzheng East Road. His fellow villager Zhu Yuhuihua came to Shanghai from his hometown to visit him a few days ago. When he was about to take a boat back to his hometown the day before yesterday (the 23rd), he bid farewell to Zhu. Zhu insisted on keeping him, and the noise alarmed a neighbor, Wang Chenshi, who mistook it for a conflict and came to mediate, causing Zhu to misunderstand and have an argument with her. She swallowed her anger and returned, feeling extremely angry. At 9:30 PM, her nephew Wang Wenlong came to visit. After she told him about the humiliation she had suffered, Wang went to argue with Zhu. They disagreed and started fighting.

<h3>Welfare Organizations Form Support Association to Assist Bethany Orphanage Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Bethany Orphanage is involved in a lawsuit filed by Chengming College against the validity of the sale, which has been ongoing for many years. The Supreme Court has now ruled, and the District Court has opened an execution court ordering them to vacate the premises within one and a half months. Although donations have been received from all walks of life to help build new houses, it is impossible to do so immediately.

<h3>Robbery on Zhongzheng East Road Solved in Eleven Hours; Suspects Arrested and Loot Recovered Based on Clues from Dismissed Maid</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] At 3:00 AM the day before yesterday, four robbers broke into the home of Chen Li Lanying, 46 years old, a Ningbo native, housewife of the Damei Flooring Company at 139 Zhongzheng East Road. Two of them were armed with guns and broke into the bedroom on the second floor, robbing two large gold bars, three small bars, one jade bracelet, one jade phoenix, one yellow diamond ring, one white diamond ring, and other jewelry such as gold square rings, wire rings, and ruby rings, estimated to be worth over 10,000 gold yuan. The case was reported to the Huangpu Police Branch for investigation. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. After receiving the report, Branch Chief Feng Wenyao instructed Criminal Division Chief Li to start the investigation. After questioning the victim in detail, it was discovered that Zhang Fang Aying, a maid who had been dismissed earlier, had visited the victim's home a few days before the incident and was highly suspected. She was immediately taken to the bureau for strict interrogation, but the maid vehemently denied it. However, according to the victim's report: It was said that one of the four bandits had a Shandong accent, and according to Aying's confession, her sister-in-law Zhou Zhifang had a friend from Shandong, which was suspicious. The police then found Zhou's residence at a certain number on the second floor of Lane 628, Henan Middle Road, and dispatched officers to the location. Zhou was out at the time, and his wife Zhou Fang Afang lost her composure when she saw the police. Upon searching, a Mauser pistol, seven bullets, two large gold bars, and jewelry were found under the bed. Afang was immediately arrested for strict interrogation, and officers were stationed to guard the location. Before long, Zhou's daughter was heard calling "Uncle," and the officers on guard realized that a man had arrived and immediately arrested him and brought him to the bureau for strict interrogation. It was then revealed that the man was the main culprit in the robbery, named Zhang Shoutang, 28 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 14, Lane 803, North Sichuan Road. Based on his confession, another large gold bar and diamond and gold rings were found. Meanwhile, the police dispatched officers to arrest accomplice Yu Xinxiang near the Minguang Theater on Haining Road. After strict interrogation, another original loot of a large gold bar and diamond rings were found in the Xu Wang Temple at the end of Jiangpu Road. Another accomplice, soldier Kong Fanjie, was arrested at 68 Fuxing East Road. Based on his confession, another Mauser gun and five bullets were found in the toilet of Zhou Fang Afang's home. Another accomplice, Huang Xinchang, is still at large, and the police branch is continuing to pursue him. The group of criminals is scheduled to be transferred to the court for investigation today. The fact that this robbery was solved in eleven hours can be said to be fast.</p>
<h3>Soul Killed Under Train Wheels at Train Station; Male Passenger Heading to Xin Zhuang Trampled to Death Crossing Tracks</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Kaixuan train departed from the North Station at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Shortly after leaving the platform, a trainman suddenly discovered that a male passenger had been crushed to death by the train and immediately stopped the train to handle the situation. According to police officer No. 987 who witnessed the scene: The passenger jumped off train number 6 and was crushed to death when he failed to avoid the train while crossing the tracks. The deceased was wearing a yellow leather jacket, western-style shorts, and had a second-class ticket for train number 61 from North Station to Xin Zhuang, a handkerchief, three silver dollars, and more than 10 million legal tender. The wheels ran over his neck and shoulder blades, and the blood and flesh were blurred, a tragic sight. The reason for his jumping off the train and crossing the tracks is speculated to be that he mistakenly boarded a Beijing-Shanghai line train and wanted to switch to a Shanghai-Hangzhou line train. In a hurry, he disregarded the danger and crossed the tracks, resulting in his death.</p>

<h3>Smilingly Welcome Golden Yuan, Angrily Drive Away Red Demons: A Look at Jiangsu in Transformation</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 23rd Dispatch] The emergency decree on financial and economic measures has been promulgated. This timely and wise decision has immediately presented the suffering Jiangsu compatriots, who have endured natural disasters and banditry, with a vision of stability, brightness, peace, and happiness. This good news has brought immeasurable joy to the refugees in Zhenjiang who can only afford a small portion of rice each day. Because the good dream they have been hoping for day and night—earning just ten or eight dollars to return home and farm—is about to come true. So, on this 23rd day, the refugees in Zhenjiang have mostly rushed to exchange their gold earrings, silver rings, and other valuables, which weigh only a few fractions of an ounce, for Golden Yuan. This phenomenon is comprehensive and universal throughout Jiangsu today. However, in the lines to exchange currency for coupons, refugees are often at the front. This phenomenon is enough to show that the refugees, who are unwilling to coexist with the communists, wholeheartedly and sincerely face the Golden Yuan and trample on the red demons, expecting a new situation of comprehensive military, political, and economic reform to shorten these unspeakable days of suffering, in order to seek a glimmer of hope for survival. In fact, except for the communists who dream of overthrowing the government with armed rebellion and economic plundering, and those leftist opportunists who act as accomplices for the bandits and call themselves the "middle route," every Chinese is preparing to welcome this stability, brightness, peace, and happiness, to jointly seek a way to survive. At this time, even if my advance report on the "Jiangsu in Transformation" is only a glimpse, I believe readers will certainly be happy to listen.</p>
<p>Unified Military Command in Northern Jiangsu, Remnant Bandits and Local Communists Collapse Together</p>
<p>Among the 63 counties and cities and one administrative bureau in Jiangsu, 38 belong to Northern Jiangsu. From the perspective of politics, military value, and geographical situation, its importance is self-evident. Moreover, the various yields of salt, cotton, wheat, rice, sorghum, corn, livestock, poultry, and aquatic products in this vast area, if not affected by natural disasters and banditry, should be worth more than 500 million US dollars. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the communists infiltrated this fertile area that could nurture millions of soldiers, and refused to give up. In terms of time, the communists have been entrenched in Northern Jiangsu for more than ten years, which cannot be said to be short. In terms of space, in this vast and fertile land, except for some important points and lines that have been recovered by the National Army, most of the vast and fertile land is still in the clutches of the remnant bandits and local communists, becoming increasingly desolate. The military authorities and the government are well aware of this serious situation. Therefore, in addition to the General Headquarters of the Army stationed in Xuzhou, there are also Pacification Zone Headquarters in Nantong and Huaiyin, conducting zonal suppression in order to specialize in success. In addition, heavy troops are stationed in Taixian, Jiangdu, and Donghai, with command organizations set up to direct and coordinate the attacks on the bandits. In the past, the military deployment was so thorough that the so-called five major prefectures of Northern Jiangsu (Xu, Hai, Huai, Yang, Tong) should have been as solid as a rock, and the evil atmosphere in the vast land of Northern Jiangsu should have been cleared up and restored to its past prosperity long ago. However, the development of things is never as simple as ideal. After sawing for two years, it is necessary to reorganize and merge into one Pacification Zone to unify the command of military suppression, in order to carry out comprehensive pacification work and complete the great task of bandit suppression. It is believed that this is indeed a smart way to save manpower, financial resources, and materials, and is suitable for the implementation of total war. In the future, the National Army will not only be able to effectively control the important points and lines in Northern Jiangsu, but also, due to the increased power of military stability, may enable the sweeping work of the area to be launched as soon as possible. However, judging from the current bandit situation, if two more reinforced divisions and four or five mobile and brave commando units can be transferred to Northern Jiangsu in the short term, then the remnant bandits and local communists will inevitably collapse and perish under this wise decision of unified command. At present, it is especially important to strengthen local teams and self-defense forces, and to strengthen the work of anti-espionage and elimination of traitors in rural towns and villages. Because the National Army cannot set up defenses in every county and station troops in every village, after the National Army defeats the remnant bandits and sweeps away the local communists, the local government must bear the important responsibility of pacifying the remaining evils and eradicating the root of the disaster. In addition to hoping to increase the number of elite troops, we also hope that the government will find ways to encourage wealthy and capable good people to return to their hometowns to organize self-defense forces and assist the National Army in carrying out the sweeping work of the area. The methods of encouragement are nothing more than: (1) Effectively guarantee the safety of the property of these wealthy and capable good people, and do not arbitrarily regard them as targets for extortion and apportionment, so that they can rest assured in their work of self-defense and defending their hometown. (2) Give the children of these people better opportunities for education, to satisfy their three wishes of defending the country, defending their hometown, and defending their family. In addition, if the selection of the county magistrate and the district and township chiefs can be properly arranged in accordance with local conditions, in accordance with the people, and in accordance with the times, without perfunctoriness, it would be even better. In short, in order to facilitate the fight against bandits, the methods of using people and money must be changed, and must become more appropriate.</p>
<p>Rumors of Provincial Government Reorganization, Hope for Reform and Emphasis on Changing People</p>
<p>Amidst the continuous calls for reform in party affairs, military affairs, finance, and economy, new news of the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has been constantly spreading in recent weeks. Undoubtedly, this suffering Jiangsu is about to turn the old into the new and the bad into the good. If it is said that Wang goes and Ding comes, not only does Chairman Wang Gong, who has experienced many ups and downs in his official career, is becoming increasingly enlightened, and wants to do a good job but is troubled by his lack of ability, listen to it indifferently (please refer to this newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch on the 23rd), but even the sensitive and argumentative people of Jiangsu also feel that it is a normal matter, because even the cabinet is reorganized after the president takes office, let alone the government of a province. Some people say that this time it will definitely be reorganized, the new master should be General Ding Zhipan, the new Secretary-General is Wang Gongyu, and the new provincial committee members who also serve as directors of departments are Wang Baoxuan (Construction), Ge Jianshi (Civil Affairs), Gu Zhuhong (Finance), and Xu Quan (Social Affairs). Some people also say that Yu Jimin will come together, and Ban Jianchu will also be invited. At the same time, some people also say that this time it may be the same as last time, just talking about it and will not be reorganized. In fact, these are all guesses. It is good to guess correctly, and it will not be a big deal if you guess wrong, anyway, it has nothing to do with the guesser. At this time, a more profound saying is: the current provincial government is stepping up the implementation of the Program for Suppressing Rebellion and Implementing Administration, and has also sent three groups of supervisory teams led by senior officials to various counties to supervise and assess the work very conscientiously. The central government may give the current provincial government a final opportunity to work hard to see the effect. In fact, this statement is just talk, but to this day, the enlightened officials and the common people in all provinces of China hope that the suppression of rebellion will be successful as soon as possible so that everyone can have a good life. To achieve this goal, from the central government to the local governments, everything must be new all the time and change at every moment, and good methods must be changed to reduce the suffering of the people. Old people using old methods are certainly not good, but new people using old methods are just going backward. The best way is to use new policies to establish a new style of administration.</p>
<p>The First Pacification Zone in Northern Jiangsu Plans to Formulate Tenant Protection Measures</p>

<h3>Survey Notes on the Crash Repair Project of the Xin-Jiao Branch Line</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xiuwu, 16th Air Mail] Railroads and coal are inseparable. The Xinxiang section of the Pinghan Line is maintaining traffic in a harsh environment. The first problem is coal.</p>
<p>When this reporter went from Xinxiang to Xiuwu that day, Xinxiang Station still had ten tons of coal, which was only enough for one passenger train departing from Xinxiang to Zhengzhou the next day. The coal for the third day had to wait for transportation from Zhengzhou, but how much did Zhengzhou have? In order to solve this problem, the Xin-Jiao branch line was started for crash repair on July 29th, half a year after the foundation was laid.</p>
<p>Crash Repair Plan</p>
<p>Was first proposed by the Jiaozuo Zhongfu Coal Mine Company. Since the Xin-Jiao Line was destroyed last year, the Qin River was breached by the communists, and highway transportation was also cut off, Jiaozuo became an isolated island. For more than a year, the mine has been struggling in poverty. In order to prevent this domestic coal mine from stopping production, it must rely on the restoration of transportation. However, the company's proposal for crash repair is not entirely for the mine itself. The price of coal in Jiaozuo is only 18 million per ton, while in Xinxiang it has been sold for 200 million. Under this abnormal state, the common people in Xinxiang and Zhengci have long been complaining.</p>
<p>More than 20 kilometers west of Xinxiang have not been damaged, and it has taken a lot of effort to collect the materials needed for the remaining less than 40 kilometers.</p>
<p>60,000 sleepers are needed, which is simply an unacceptable burden for the railway bureau. When things are desperate, there will be change, and change will lead to success. When there is no way,</p>
<p>Think of a way</p>
<p>This method is to have the fourth district commissioner's office order the county governments of Boai, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Xinxiang, and Ji County to borrow sleepers from the people. After the Xin-Jiao Line is repaired, the Zhongfu Coal Mine Company will use the coal produced to be transported free of charge by the Pinghan Road to Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng and other places for sale. The company will only take the profits from the factory price to repay the wood money. The price of each sleeper is 2.4 million yuan. After the sleeper problem is solved, there are no other difficulties in the remaining materials. Rails can be used piecemeal, spikes can be made by themselves, and splints can be temporarily replaced by cutting down light rails. Fortunately, in times of emergency, there is only emergency response. The director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau said well: "First seek its passage, then seek its preparation." What problem is more important to the railway itself than passage?</p>

<h3>Fragrant Pears, Beautiful Melons, Magnificent Mountains and Rivers: A Glimpse of the "Melon and Fruit City" Orchard</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Reporter, Song Lin</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 17th Air Mail] "Dali is the garden of China, and Lanzhou is the orchard of China." Henry Wallace, the leader of the Third Party of the United States and the presidential candidate this year, also added the crown of "Melon and Fruit City" to Lanzhou when he passed through Lanzhou several years ago. In his "Northwest Travelogue" poems, President Yu (Youren) vividly described his love for melons and fruits. Just picking two sentences: "Fragrant pears, beautiful melons, magnificent mountains and rivers," and "Icy snow and soft children's fragrance," is enough to make people yearn for.</p>
<p>Lanzhou's melons have the most varieties in the country. In addition to the general cantaloupe, cucumber, loofah, pumpkin, winter melon, pumpkin, etc., the watermelon and drunken melon, Wallace melon, produced are especially famous.</p>
<p>Each Watermelon Weighs Forty Catties</p>
<p>The watermelons are large and sweet. A normal one can weigh 30 to 40 catties. The melon season is from June to September every year, but if they are properly stored in cellars, there are still opportunities to enjoy them in the cold winter, so there is a proverb: "Eating watermelon while holding a stove." The varieties of watermelons are divided into white skin, black skin, and flower skin according to the skin color. According to the melon pulp, there are yellow pulp and red pulp. Except for variants, white skin and black skin are mostly yellow pulp, and flower skin are mostly red pulp. Watermelons are mostly planted in the sandy fields on both sides of the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Lanzhou. Seeds are sown in early spring every year. Each mound of land (about 2.5 mu) can plant 600 to 700 plants, with a row spacing of about 6 shichi and a plant spacing of about 1.5 cun. Each mound of land is fertilized with more than 1,000 catties. Watermelons are most afraid of irrigation. Except for prolonged drought and no rain, when it is absolutely necessary, water is poured in moderation. If the amount of water is slightly more, the sugar content of the melon will be reduced, and the quality will also deteriorate. Therefore, this is also the reason why melons must be planted in sandy fields. (Sandy fields can absorb and contain water in large quantities, and can resist alkali). The cultivation of watermelons is hard work. Its owner will be anxious for it due to a gust of wind or rain, and cover it with a pottery to shield it from the wind and rain. After it has grown for more than 110-120 days, it will be picked and smoothly transported down the Yellow River on a sheepskin raft to the Leitang River melon market to be sold.</p>
<p>Flower Skin Varieties Are the Most Famous</p>
<p>Watermelons are mostly oval. White skins are the first to market, flower skins are the most famous watermelons in Lanzhou, and the output is also large. Its market is the peak of the melon season. Black skin is a late-maturing variety, which is marketed in early August every year. Of the above three types, in terms of quality, flower skin is the best, black skin is the second best, and white skin is the worst. In terms of economic value, white skin has the benefit of early market, but if the three are on the market at the same time, the price of black skin is the highest, flower skin is the second highest, and white skin is far behind. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, watermelons, drunken melons, etc. produced in various places are mostly only for local sales. As for the interests of melon farmers, according to a rough survey, planting melons on each mound of land can obtain a net profit of more than 70%, which is much more profitable than cultivating other crops. This is also the main reason for the prosperity of Lanzhou's melons.</p>
<p>Specialty Drunken Claws Are Famous Throughout the Country</p>
<p>Drunken melon is a real Lanzhou specialty, famous throughout the country. Because it is only produced in Miaotanzi and Donggang Town in the suburbs of Lanzhou, the output is relatively small, and it is "rare is precious." It is said that there are also varieties of drunken melon in Japan and the United States, called musk melon. In Southeast Asia, noble ladies can only taste a little bit when eating Western pastries. (All canned) And in Lanzhou, each one currently sells for only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. In every flight, it is carried to Ping, Jin, Jing, Hu, and Han as valuable gifts for people to taste lightly. Don't look at its small body and rough skin, and some cracked-like stripes on the outside, but when you open it, the pulp is thick and juicy, and it is sweet and mellow when you eat it. It is the head of the ladies in the melon and fruit industry, and it is the most popular!</p>
<p>Wallace Melon Trial Planting Is Excellent</p>
<p>Another type of melon that tastes similar to drunken melon is called "Wallace Melon." It is a famous variety from Ukraine (or the United States, according to one theory) that Wallace gave when he came to Lanzhou. It has been tried to be planted in Lanzhou for several years, and the results are excellent. In the past two years, in terms of output, it almost overwhelmed everything and dominated the market. It's just that the annual cycle is unfavorable this year, and the output has been sharply reduced by about 30%. The skin of the Wallace melon is a smooth, light yellow color, and the pulp is similar to that of the drunken melon, but the sugar content is too much, and the water content is ultimately not as suitable as that of the drunken melon. A good drunken melon has a pungent aroma of wine, which Wallace melon and Hami melon cannot compete with.</p>
<p>Hami melon is a seed that was moved from Hami. After many years of trial planting, it is always not as good as the original place of origin, and it cannot be made into melon jerky. In recent years, the output has been replaced by Wallace melon.</p>
<p>Drunken melon, Wallace melon, and Hami melon are all planted in sandy fields. The cultivation method is roughly the same as that of watermelon, and the hard work is even more. There is also a seed melon, which is smaller in shape than watermelon, has many seeds and thin skin, and is specially taken for seeds. The Lanzhou area can produce 242,200 catties of melon seeds every year, which are roasted all year round for leisure needs.</p>
<p>Pear Fruits Are Plump and Can Be Stored for a Long Time</p>
<p>Speaking of Lanzhou's fruits, the most famous and the saltiest in production is pears. There are many varieties of pears, and some are genuine specialties. Although no one has accurately investigated the exact output, because pears are resistant to storage, and the Lanzhou climate is also suitable for the storage of fruits, so all year round, they can always be found in the market, becoming the most consumed fresh fruit. Its status in Lanzhou can be compared to that of citrus in the south.</p>
<p>Soft Pear and Other Types Are the Most Produced</p>
<p>There are roughly the following types of pears: (1) Long Handle Pear: Marketed in August, the skin is light brown, each weighs about 2-3 taels, the flesh is white and slightly hard, the taste is slightly sour, and it is not considered a good product. (2) Crispy Wood Pear: Marketed in Mid-Autumn Festival, the skin is light yellow, the flesh is white and crispy, each weighs about 3-4 taels, and the quality is better than the former. (3) Woli Pear: Marketed after Mid-Autumn Festival, the skin is yellow-green, the flesh is fine and astringent, and it can only be eaten after being stored until the flesh becomes soft. (4) Soft Pear: It is the most produced and most famous specialty in Lanzhou. It matures in mid-October, each weighs about 4-5 taels, the skin is light yellow and tastes astringent, and the flesh contains sand grains, so it is not suitable for eating raw. It must be stored in a cellar until the severe winter, when it freezes hard and turns black, and then immersed in cool water to soften it. Peel and suck the flesh and water, which is chilly, fragrant and sweet. People who come to Lanzhou for the first time see that the fruit skin is full of dust and as hard as iron eggs, and they simply don't dare to ask. After eating it once or twice, most people will be addicted to it. (5) Diaodanzi: Shaped like a pigeon egg, weighing about 1 tael. When it is first picked, it is light brown and tastes very astringent. It must be stored like a soft pear until after the New Year, when it turns black and soft, and is marketed in strings, like eating grapes, one bite at a time, with a special flavor. (6) Winter Fruit Pear: It is the most famous pear in Lanzhou, and its output is second only to soft pears, but it is the only fresh fruit in winter. It begins to mature in November and is most suitable for storage. It can still be seen for sale in May and June of the following year. The skin is yellow-green, with thick and thin distinctions, the flesh is white, fine and crisp, the juice is very abundant, the sweet and sour is moderate, and it is no less than the Yazi pear in North China. It can be eaten raw after picking. After storage, the taste is even more beautiful, and it is especially delicious when cooked. The hot winter fruit in Lanzhou winter night is indeed a top-quality product.</p>
<p>Peaches, Plums, Apricots, and Dates Have Their Own Merits</p>
<p>In addition, peaches, plums, apricots, dates, cherries, persimmons, walnuts, apples, shaju, red qin, grapes, ... are all cultivated. Not only do they have different shapes, but they also have their own merits. Especially peaches, apricots, and apples, which have a large output and delicious taste. The price is even cheaper. Every year after autumn, various fruits are launched on the market one after another. The streets and alleys are colorful and cluttered, and the shouts of vendors resound through the clouds. It is the most prosperous season for the melon and fruit city.</p>
<p>Dried Fruits Exported in Alarming Numbers</p>
<p>The orchards and melon fields near Lanzhou are everywhere. In summer, the fruits grow, and the branches cannot bear the weight. They are supplemented with high poles and fine ropes, so that they can develop at will and become beautiful fruits with abundant harvests. Although there are no accurate statistics on the annual output of these melons and fruits, they are all eaten or made into dried fruits, which are sold to other places. It is said that the annual output of dried fruits reaches 1,272,500 catties, and sweet apricot kernels reach 35,000 catties, and the annual export reaches 250,000 catties.</p>
<p>The cultivation methods in the melon and fruit city have remained the same for hundreds of years. Although the Gansu Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute is in Lanzhou, it can only do some improved experimental work. The prosperity of the "Chinese Orchard" still has to undergo a scientific baptism.</p>

<h3>After the Suspension of Operations at the Securities Exchange, All Transactions Were Cleared; The Exchange Advised Brokers Not to Engage in Illegal Transactions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Shanghai Securities Exchange, following orders, suspended operations from August 20th, it stipulated that all transactions completed by brokers should be settled clearly within the 23rd and 24th. It is learned that the total transaction amount of all brokers reached over 24 million Gold Yuan (originally over 729 trillion Legal Tender), all of which have been settled clearly in accordance with regulations. Our reporter recently interviewed Mr. Wang Zhixin, the General Manager of the Exchange, who stated that it was gratifying that such a large amount of settlements were completed by all brokers within two days. He also stated that he believes that this suspension of operations, ordered by the Exchange, is not only a necessary measure for the government's implementation of emergency financial and economic measures, but also beneficial to the future business of all brokers. In the future, when the government promotes public debt policies, consolidates issuance reserves, and guides funds previously stagnant in gold notes into productive construction channels, the mission of the Exchange will become even more important. As for private gold businesses, in order to cooperate with national policies and promote production, their source of funds will especially require the assistance of exchange institutions. Therefore, when the time is right, the government will certainly allow the Exchange to resume operations quickly. It is hoped that all brokers will strictly abide by laws and regulations, conduct strict self-examination, and not engage in illegal trading activities, so as to avoid attracting criticism and affecting the date of resumption. The Exchange has also sent a circular to all brokers to this effect, urging them not to engage in illegal trading activities during the suspension period of the Exchange, so as not to affect the date of resumption.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Securities Exchange Brokers Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 24th. All directors and supervisors attended, with Chairman Wang Li-Shi-Chang Nai-Xu presiding. They discussed association affairs after the ordered suspension of operations and decided to convene a temporary membership meeting on the 26th of this month. They also notified all brokers that, before being ordered to resume operations, they should strictly abide by regulations and completely cease engaging in securities trading on behalf of customers.</p>
<h3>Urgent Notice from the Yarn Industry Association: Yarn Sales Must Not Exceed the Price Limit</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Industry Association posted an urgent notice in the market yesterday, stating that on August 20th, the government promulgated Article 13 of the "Measures for Strengthening Economic Control," which stated; "The prices of all commodities and labor services throughout the country should be sold by converting the prices of various commodities in each region on August 19th, 1948, into Gold Yuan according to the exchange rate, and the local competent authorities should strictly supervise and implement this." Article 14 of the same measures stated: "After converting the prices of various commodities and labor services into Gold Yuan according to the previous article, the regulations prohibiting price violations and bargaining should be strictly enforced, and price increases are not allowed unless approved by the competent authorities for special reasons." Now, the prices of various cotton yarns in this city on August 19th are converted into Gold Yuan and listed below. All cotton yarn transactions in this city market should be based on the listed prices and must not exceed them. In addition to the Market Management Committee of this association carrying out strict supervision at all times, it is hoped that all members will not deliberately violate the law, so as not to fall into the legal net, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Slack Yarn Market Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were characterized by relaxed credit for businesses, manufacturers' reduced willingness to sell, and a rally in buying sentiment from Shanghai merchants and customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, Hankou, and other regions, as confidence rebounded after the previous day's sharp decline. However, after the currency reform, in order to implement national policy and suppress price increases, the authorities were conducting strict surveillance by uniformed police personnel, and the Association had also advised the trade not to exceed the market prices of the 19th. As a result, trading was slack. However, the market opened with a somewhat vigorous atmosphere, but after the brokers were advised, they did not engage in trading beyond the price limits, and transactions were thin. Fine yarns were rarely traded; only 32s, 21s, 20s, and 10s yarns were traded in four or five varieties, and prices rose slightly by 50 to 70 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the Wealth Bureau would temporarily prohibit re-exports, and the market became confused. All parties waited quietly for the authorities to take action, and no transactions were made. There was also no price quoting outside the market.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Rises to the Limit</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market saw some floating capital from the Central Bank's release of silver and gold exchange positions, and the industry's credit also eased. Generally, the market looked optimistic, and retail investors took the opportunity to raise prices for sales. Cloth merchants and dyeing factories watched, and although some in the market were selling, the buying momentum was difficult to contain.</p>
<p>Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth jumped two yuan and seven jiao upon opening. As sellers continued to release goods, the market fell slightly by five jiao. Subsequently, because of outside market activity, there were more buyers. Although the Fangjian Company was distributing Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Serge, there was still no bidding. Around 11 o'clock, news of a rise in the yarn market spread, and cloth merchants' asking prices also gradually increased, finally closing at 29 yuan and one jiao, a rebound of four yuan and one jiao compared to the previous day, about four jiao short of the price limit on the 19th. Other cloths also turned bullish, but colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained at their original prices, with 2,800 bolts transacted.</p>
<p>Another report: It was heard that Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Serge rose to their limits after closing. In the afternoon, rumors spread that yarn market brokers had been arrested for quoting prices outside the market, and confidence in the industry suddenly weakened. Longtou fine cloth fell to 28 yuan and five jiao, and Sijunzi Serge also fell slightly to 27 yuan in transactions. Other cloths also saw slight declines compared to the afternoon closing.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Face Difficult Circumstances; Two Suggestions Provided</h3>
<p>The Silk Industry Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Regions previously convened a meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss remedial measures due to the difficult circumstances faced by various silk factories. After Chairman Chen Ai-Shi consulted with relevant parties, it was heard that the Assistance and Guidance Council had drafted a remedial plan, but a decision had been delayed, so various silk factories remained on the sidelines.</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, the problems urgently needing to be solved are: (1) Since the Technical Department of the Assistance and Guidance Council announced the reeling costs for the first half of July, it has failed to announce the reeling costs for the second half of July and the first half of August on time. Various factories feel unable to advance funds, so it is hoped that the Assistance and Guidance Council will announce the reeling costs for each period as soon as possible, so as to avoid losses to various silk factories. (2) Since the currency reform, the government has paid more attention to export commodities, and the procurement methods for various silk factories reeling raw silk on behalf of the government should be as reasonable as possible.</p>
<h3>Rayon Resumes Distribution; Finished Products Continue to be Auctioned This Week</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau has scheduled a rayon price negotiation meeting for 10:00 AM today and will simultaneously resume distribution to meet market demand. Furthermore, last week the Bureau auctioned various materials with a total value of 200,000 Gold Yuan. In order to cooperate with the new economic measures promulgated by the authorities, a large amount will continue to be auctioned this week. It is heard that the materials are mostly finished products purchased by the Bureau.</p>
<h3>After Our Currency Reform, Hong Kong is Extremely Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Commodity Research Institute, Hong Kong, 23rd] Since our country reformed its currency system, Chinese and foreign people are all optimistic about the future of the Gold Yuan. The reasons are: (1) The government still possesses a large amount of materials, and US aid to China is arriving successively. Moreover, the government will certainly act cautiously in issuing Gold Yuan this time, and with the above materials as a backing, it can tighten credit at any time and prevent it from becoming loose and abused. (2) After the currency value is stabilized, the government's tax revenue can actually increase. (3) Overseas remittances can also greatly increase. (4) Export settlement can be strengthened after the announcement of the conversion at the new US dollar exchange rate, and the amount of settlement can also increase. All of this is sufficient to strengthen the reserves of the Gold Yuan and move towards stability. If the Gold Yuan achieves stability, then the assistance that the United States has added to our country will be further strengthened. The impact of the issuance of Gold Yuan on Hong Kong is also quite important. (1) If the Gold Yuan achieves stability, gold, US dollars, US banknotes, standard banknotes, forward banknotes, and domestic remittances in the Hong Kong financial market will all fall into a sideways state, and will not be as lively as they are now, so the banking industry will be the first to be affected. (2) If the Gold Yuan is stable, our country will definitely increase imports, then Hong Kong's trade with our country may increase. (3) Smugglers in the mainland will also be more active than before due to the stability of the finances. (4) The trend of Hong Kong dollar standards in the mainland will inevitably disappear. Few Hong Kong dollars circulating in the mainland will naturally gradually return to Hong Kong, increasing the amount of capital in the Hong Kong market. At the same time, the number of mainland funds fleeing to Hong Kong will also inevitably decrease, allowing Hong Kong to gradually restore its normal state. Its impact on Hong Kong is also quite good.</p>
<h3>Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency: Jianghai Customs Restricts Entry and Exit; Anything Exceeding the Specified Amount Will Be Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday, stating that it had received an order from the Director-General of Customs stating that the "Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People" had been promulgated and implemented by the government. According to the provisions of the measures:</p>
<p>(1) Gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency notes are strictly prohibited from being carried out of the country. However, this restriction does not apply to gold jewelry with a total weight not exceeding two market taels, silver jewelry with a total weight not exceeding twenty market taels, or foreign currency notes for travel expenses with a certificate issued by a bank selling foreign currency notes, with a total value not exceeding US$100.</p>
<p>(2) Those carrying gold, silver, silver coins, gold and silver ornaments, or foreign currency notes into the country should declare them to the Customs. Except for gold jewelry with a total weight not exceeding two market taels and silver jewelry with a total weight not exceeding twenty market taels, which may be carried in personal possession, the remainder should be submitted to the Central Bank or its entrusted bank for conversion into Gold Yuan at the prescribed exchange rate. Transit or tourist travelers who, in addition to the gold and silver ornaments they are allowed to carry in personal possession according to the preceding paragraph, still need to carry all of their gold, silver, and foreign currency out of the country should declare them to the Customs upon entry and hand them over to the Central Bank or its entrusted bank for sealing and safekeeping, and retrieve the original items upon exit. However, if they have not requested the return of the items for carrying out of the country within six months after entry, they should be converted into Gold Yuan at the prescribed exchange rate.</p>
<p>(3) Those who violate the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) will have their gold, silver, silver coins, or foreign currency notes confiscated. Those who are discovered and confiscated due to confidential reports will be awarded 40% of the value of the confiscated items to the informant.</p>
<h3>Origin Prices Plummet, Confidence is Weak; Rice Prices Decline Again; Flour, Cooking Oil, and Other Items Rise Consistently</h3>
<p>Rice prices continued to decline due to falling prices in the Xishi market, causing a great deal of market anxiety. Those who held goods felt that prices at origin had already fallen, so they also lowered prices for sales, but rice stores remained slack in accepting goods, and prices fell again. Both glutinous rice and indica rice fell by one yuan in the Nanshi market, while they fell by less than 20 yuan in the Beishi market. Special grade glutinous rice was 21 yuan and five jiao in the Beishi market, Kunshan new indica rice was 17 yuan and two jiao, and rough indica rice opened at 13 yuan including the bag. Arrivals yesterday decreased due to rain, with a total of 3,748 shi in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour stopped falling and turned to rise. Because credit loosened and prices of non-industry goods rose, market sentiment strengthened, and traders and retail investors took the opportunity to acquire goods, and the market rose again. Most brands of flour exceeded seven yuan. The highest price of Lao Che flour reached seven yuan, three jiao, and five fen, closing at seven yuan and two jiao. Bingshan flour opened at six yuan and eight jiao and closed at six yuan, nine jiao, and five fen, up three jiao and three jiao and five fen respectively. Hong Feng, Jian Cheng, and other flours all opened at seven yuan, and miscellaneous brands of flour all rose three or four jiao. Bran was slightly higher.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains all turned higher. Due to the loosening of credit, customers were more willing to accept goods, and cargo owners also held back and sold. Soybeans initially rose by two jiao, but then rose again due to rising soybean cake prices, finally rising by five jiao. Corn and Yuan wheat were very popular among Qingdao merchants, rising by one yuan and five jiao. Broad beans were slightly higher, and red sorghum saw no transactions. Sesame prices were still flat, and sales were very active. Raw peanuts were quoted one yuan higher than the previous day, with Dawenkou raw peanuts closing at 33 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking oil also rose again. The reasons were that credit loosened, and prices of non-industry goods rose, and the mentality of those holding goods was firm. The willingness to accept goods from merchants and retailers was also strong. Soybean oil opened at 50 yuan, and the last recycled soybean oil from Dayou was 52 yuan, reaching the price limit of August 19th. Other soybean oils were 51 yuan and five jiao, and vegetable oil closed at 46 yuan, each rising by three yuan. Raw oil also rose by three yuan, Jiton vegetable oil was 61 yuan, and small car sesame oil added one yuan. Soybean cake rose by three jiao, and Lizi cake was four yuan and three jiao.</p>
<h3>Credit Has Been Seen to Loosen; Banks and Bureaus Continue to Release Funds</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the second day of the issuance of Gold Yuan, and credit in the market was significantly looser than the previous day. Most financial circles had ample funds, so they were able to cope with ease. Even various industries outside the financial circle found borrowing and lending more convenient than before. The tight situation eased, and secret interest rates fell from six jiao to four jiao and five fen.</p>
<p>National banks and bureau treasuries continued to release 1.33 million yuan. The Central Bank released 5.11 million yuan, with 1.12 million yuan entering the big exchange, and foreign merchants released 30,000 yuan, with 240,000 yuan entering the small exchange. The Bank of China entered 80,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications entered 3.03 million yuan, the China Agricultural Bank and the China Credit Bank each entered 130,000 yuan, the Postal Remittance Bureau entered 320,000 yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury entered 90,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The exchange situation at the clearing house has also returned to a state of calm, and by about 5:00 PM, the settlement was completed. Yesterday, a total of 262,965 checks were exchanged, with a total exchange amount of 63,797,222,000 yuan, a large decrease compared to the previous day. The number of bounced checks on the previous day was 13,836, with an amount of 2,240,718.11 yuan. Yesterday, there were 3,950 bounced checks, with an amount of 796,403.79 yuan. The number of bounced checks and the amount also saw a sharp decrease.</p>
<h3>Export Settlement Figures from January to May of This Year Released</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources from the Export Control Commission: Although the export industry once contracted from January to May of this year due to the increasing cost of domestic products and the overly low foreign exchange rate of the National Bank, the settlement figures to designated banks over five months still reached US$91,988,138, a decrease of only 14% compared to the settlement figures of US$107,103,333 in the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee Ordered to Be Closed Down</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank recently received an order from the Executive Yuan: After the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Order, the original listed market price of foreign exchange by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee should be canceled. The Committee has also been ordered to be closed down and has now stopped accepting and delivering.</p>
<h3>Sales of State-Owned Enterprises: Preparation Work is Becoming More Active</h3>
<p>Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, as there are explicit provisions in the new economic measures plan, the preparation work for the sale is gradually becoming more active. Chen Qi-Tian, the concurrently serving Chairman of the China Textile Construction Corporation under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, has scheduled to come to Shanghai this Saturday (28th) to preside over the 13th regular meeting of the company's board of directors, where he will give instructions on the preparatory work for the sale of the company.</p>
<h3>Methods for Increasing Capital of Financial Institutions: Banks and Bureaus Telegraph the Ministry of Finance for Instructions</h3>
<p>There are no explicit provisions in the financial and economic emergency measures regarding the issue of increased capital for financial institutions. The increase in capital for state-owned banks and bureaus cannot be handled. If calculated based on the pre-war amount of 50 million yuan, converted into Gold Yuan, it would be a mere 16 yuan or so. Whether the standard for increasing capital will be calculated according to an index or if there are other regulations, instructions have been requested from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Quiet Tea Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: The process remained quiet, and there was a lack of actual transactions. The reason is that the holders of red and green tea mostly quoted prices in Gold Yuan, which differed from the previous week. Exporters felt that there were no shipping schedules within the month, and the results of reporting to foreign countries had not yet been received, so buying sentiment was hesitant, and the trend continued to show a state of silence on both the entry and exit sides. Looking at this situation, it is feared that the situation will be difficult to improve this week.</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Education Convened a Meeting of Principals of Private Primary and Secondary Schools to Discuss the Issue of Tuition Fees for the Next Semester; Private Schools Advocate Not Only Hard and Fast Regulations to Restrict Schools; Opinions from All Parties Will Be Compiled and Submitted to the Mayor for Final Decision</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The standards for tuition and miscellaneous fees for colleges and universities in the city have been agreed upon by the presidents of various schools, at 80 to 100 Gold Yuan. Director Li of the Municipal Bureau of Education convened the principals of various private primary and secondary schools at Yucai Middle School at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of fees. More than 150 people attended, and the meeting lasted for two and a half hours. Because the standards proposed by the principals could not approach the standards suggested by Director Li, the matter will be submitted to Mayor Wu for approval.</p>
<p>Explain the Philosophy of Running Schools for Education</p>
<p>At the beginning of the symposium, Director Li first explained the government's currency reform, so the amount of fees should be calculated in salary and currency units. He also hoped that participants in discussing this issue must bear in mind that the education sector provides education for education and runs schools to serve education. Then the discussion began. Wan Er-Xiang of the Private Primary and Secondary School Association believed that the government's current currency reform is intended to restore the situation to the pre-war situation. Before the war, the government did not restrict school fees, so he hoped that the current government would also not restrict the fees of various schools and not bind various schools with prescribed figures.</p>
<p>Advocate Doubling According to Pre-War Standards</p>
<p>In principle, the Association hopes to restore the fee figures to pre-war standards. For example, those who charged 8 yuan before the war should now charge 16 yuan, and those who charged 20 yuan before the war should now charge 40 yuan. Then a representative from the Principals Association of Private Schools in various districts spoke, all believing that the various schools are located in different areas, and the fee standards cannot be generalized. Because the residents in the suburbs are poor, the fees charged by the schools in the suburbs in the previous semester have always been lower than the standards stipulated by the government, otherwise no one will attend school, and they will have to close their doors. Therefore, it is generally believed that the government should not rigidly stipulate and restrict private school fees and that various schools can determine their own fees separately based on the actual situation of equipment. Representatives from various districts also reported the fee standards that have been set in various districts.</p>
<p>Hope Not to Make Rigid Regulations</p>
<p>Shen Tong-Yi, the principal of Nanyang Model School, continued, saying: The school's tuition and miscellaneous fees before the war were 52 yuan for high school, 42 yuan for junior high school, and 36 yuan for primary school. If calculated according to the Gold Yuan, high school should be 104 yuan, junior high school 84 yuan, and primary school 72 yuan. However, it is impossible to charge according to this standard in reality. Therefore, he hopes that the government does not rigidly regulate school fees. Cui Jian-Wu, the principal of Daozhong Women's Middle School, believed that the education business is a business of conscience, so don't haggle over every penny. She summarized the opinions of the representatives from various schools in attendance and proposed a fee range of 20 to 40 yuan for primary school, 40 to 60 yuan for junior high school, and 60 to 80 yuan for high school.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Education Suggests Fee Standards</p>
<p>At this point, Director Li stated that he himself has always advocated not imposing rigid regulations on school fees and, on the other hand, setting up more free places, taking care of the children of the poor. However, school fees must take into account the livelihood of teachers and school expenses, and must also take into account the burden on the general public, otherwise many disputes will inevitably occur. He believed that although the prices of rice and other items are now doubled according to the Gold Yuan conversion, it is not reasonable to calculate the fees according to the pre-war standard doubled. Even in terms of the treatment of public education personnel, it is still lower than before the war. Based on the Bureau of Education's calculations, he suggested that the primary school tuition and miscellaneous fee standard be 20 to 25 yuan, junior high school 35 to 45 yuan, and high school 45 to 55 yuan. The principals of various schools mostly believed that Director Li's suggestions were unacceptable, and no decision was reached, so the meeting adjourned. Director Li will combine the opinions of the principals of various schools and his suggestions and submit them to Mayor Wu for final decision.</p>
<p>The Director Explains the Basis of the Calculation</p>
<p>The basis for the Bureau of Education's calculation of fees is based on the assumption that the treatment of private school teachers is the same as that of municipal school teachers. The current average salary of junior high school teachers in municipal schools is a base salary of 280 Legal Tender, which is converted into 88 Gold Yuan after discounts. Assuming that each class has two teachers, the total monthly salary is 176 yuan. Assuming that each class has six months, the total salary is 1,056 yuan. According to the regulations, 70% is used for salary expenses and 30% is used for office expenses. The office expenses are 458 yuan. The total amount of salary and office expenses for each class for six months is 1,514 yuan. Assuming that there are 48 students per class, and deducting the 25% free places, there are 36 students. Dividing the total amount of expenditure by 36 students, the amount that each junior high school student should pay is 42 yuan. High school and primary school are also calculated according to this formula. The average salary of high school teachers is a base salary of 280 Legal Tender, and the salary of primary school teachers is 180 yuan. According to this, it can be known that the fee that each high school student should pay is 52 yuan, and the fee for primary school is more than 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Director Li Sincerely Advised Private Schools to Change Their Style</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Li of the Municipal Bureau of Education, in addition to expounding the philosophy of running schools to serve education at the meeting of principals of private primary and secondary schools to discuss the issue of fees, also made several points, sincerely advising various private schools to pay attention to: (1) The treatment of teachers in municipal schools and private schools should not differ too much. (2) Starting this semester, regardless of how much each school charges, 70% of the total revenue should be used as salaries for teachers and staff, with the principle of paying it all at once. If it is paid in installments, the surplus funds cannot be kept privately by the principal alone. A management committee should be organized jointly by the principal and representatives of teachers and staff. (3) It is hoped that the parent-teacher associations of various schools will be established as soon as possible so that they can supervise and assist the schools at any time. (4) The number of free places in various schools must be expanded as much as possible so that children from poor families can also enroll. (5) Many past bad practices should be eliminated, and the method of keeping extra funds is one example. Textbook fees cannot be forcibly collected either. (6) Schools must be responsible for conducting thorough assessments of student applications for free tuition. A small number of school teachers discriminate against or look down on free students, causing great mental pain to free students. Principals should immediately admonish this kind of "anti-education" phenomenon.</p>
<h3>The Middle and Small Joint Resolutions to Set Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Private Middle and Elementary School Joint Council held its 43rd Board Meeting at 553 Zhongzheng Middle Road yesterday (24th) afternoon. Forty-one directors and supervisors attended, with Chief Xie of the Secondary Education Department of the Bureau of Education in attendance. After detailed discussions on tuition fees for this semester, the following resolutions were made: "Private school tuition fees shall be determined independently by each school in reference to pre-war standards. However, if the government must propose an amount for schools to use as a reference, the principles are 70 to 80 yuan for high school, 50 to 60 yuan for junior high school, and 30 to 40 yuan for elementary school." It was also resolved: (1) Teacher salaries are set at 70% of the school's total income. (2) The 25th will host attendance for those at the Training and Education Symposium.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Consolation Match; Easily Defeats Great Britain; Both Sides Display Complete Sportsmanship; Relaxed and Pleasant Throughout</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Our Report from London by Airmail] The track and field and swimming events of the World Games, which began on August 9th, have all come to an end, and the results of each event are not as satisfactory as expected. Most of the ball games have entered the semi-finals or finals. In the basketball round robin, a new consolation round has been created, in which several teams eliminated in the preliminary rounds compete again to arrange the rankings, so that the defeated teams can also find some consolation. Unfortunately, our team has also entered this consolation round. The day before yesterday, they first met the Swedish team and returned with a victory. Today (August 11th), they met the host of the World Games—the British team.</p>
<p>The game was held at the Haringey Gymnasium at 2:00 PM on August 11th (Wednesday), and there was heavy rain again. Except for the first two days after the opening ceremony, the rest of the days of this Games have been either overcast or rainy. Such inferior weather has greatly disappointed both athletes and spectators.</p>
<p>This game was quite unique. Both sides displayed complete sportsmanship and were relaxed and pleasant throughout. Although the British team members were all over six feet tall, their movements were indescribably sluggish. They never bravely snatched the ball, and after they got the ball, they were slow to advance. The members of our team also played calmly and easily defeated the British team with a score of 54 to 25. The members of our team repeatedly used small tricks, which left the other side at a loss and won continuous applause from the friendly spectators. The game progressed as follows:</p>
<p>Lineup of our team:</p>
<p>(Yu Ruizhang) Huang Tianxi</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang Cai Wenhua (Jia Zhijun)</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao Bao Songyuan</p>
<p>Our army still fought with the same lineup as before. After the opening, Huang Tianxi fouled, and the British team scored one goal. But in an instant, Cai Wenhua scored a long shot, making it two to one. The two guards of the British team did not intercept the ball and were repeatedly penalized for free throws. Four to one, after a long melee, our team always had the upper hand, and the score difference was eight or nine points. In the first half, twenty-three to fourteen, our country took the lead. In the second half, the ground was changed and the battle was resumed. The spirit of the members of our team suddenly lifted, and the score soared. In an instant, it became twenty-seven to fourteen. The other side occasionally scored a goal, but our army immediately responded with two goals, and the score difference between the two teams increased. In the last ten minutes, it became forty-six to twenty-one. Coach Song dispatched Yu Ruizhang and Jia Zhijun to the arena, and the performance was even more exciting. The British team members had no room to operate, and the game ended with a score of fifty-four to twenty-seven. Our team won a great victory.</p>
<h3>Deaf and Mute Symposium; Lou Wenao Speaks; Finished 10,000 Meters and Received Commemorative Medal; Marathon Withdrew Due to Foot Pain</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Deaf and Mute Association held a reception yesterday afternoon at the Youth Association for Lou Wenao, a deaf and mute general who had just returned from the World Games in England. Lou stated: I participated in both the 10,000-meter and marathon events, but unfortunately, I failed in both, which is very regrettable. As for the reasons for the failure, I will list two points: (1) I wore spiked shoes for the 10,000-meter race. During the race, the spiked shoes had a problem, and my feet were rubbed and injured, causing bleeding. I barely ran the entire course and received a commemorative medal, but I did not score. (2) I wore running shoes for the marathon, and the soles were thin. I originally wanted to buy thicker running shoes to participate in the competition, but I didn't have enough time, so I had to wear them. After starting, I was in the lead in the first half of the race, but later, because the road was uneven and my feet were injured, the pain was severe, and I had to withdraw halfway and couldn't rest. Regarding the seventh place in the 5,000 meters, I deny it. Finally, Lou Xisan encouraged the deaf and mute generals to recuperate and show their skills in the future.</p>
<h3>The Last Battle; Hastily Ended; Lost to Italy</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 18th, our team faced the Italian team again in the Haringey Gymnasium to compete for the consolation championship. The Italian team's skills were not high. Based on the past performance of our team, we could have won the victory with a 90% chance, but unexpectedly, today's performance was very disappointing. The team members still had energy in the first half of the game, but after that, it was purely perfunctory. As a result, the game ended hastily. The biggest reason was that the team members were all scheduled to fly back to the country at 4:00 PM tomorrow, so they had no intention of fighting. In addition, left guard Huang Tianxi had already returned to Singapore yesterday, and the team lacked a vital force, making the formation even more lax. The poor performance of the game was unprecedented. The lineup of our team was as follows:</p>
<p>(Yu Ruizhang) Wu Chengzhang Li Shiqiao (Cai Zhongqiang)</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong Bao Songyuan</p>
<p>After the opening, our team's offense and defense were still up to standard. The Italian center was tall and had incredibly accurate turnaround shots. After Coach Song instructed our team members to mark him closely, he was at a loss. The scores of both sides gradually approached. Ten to fourteen, in the middle, our country once led with nineteen to seventeen, and in the first half, twenty-five to twenty-one, our army lost by four points.</p>
<p>In the second half, the field was changed and the battle was resumed. Li Zhenzhong was transferred out, and Jia Zhijun replaced him. At first, the difference between the two teams was only four or five points. In the last quarter of an hour, the fatigue of the players on our team was exposed, and the formation was unprecedentedly chaotic. Right guard Bao Songyuan took the ball alone and neglected to defend. The connection was completely lost, and the entire field was controlled by Italy. The score soared and took the lead with forty to twenty-six. Our army's deployment of troops could not reverse the overall situation, and the game ended hastily with a score of fifty-four to thirty-eight.</p>
<h3>Ping City Rowing Competition</h3>
<p>Held at Beihai at the End of the Month</p>
<p>[Our Report from Beiping on the 24th] The Ping City Rowing Competition for the 37th year is scheduled to be held at the Five Dragon Pavilion in Beihai on the 28th and 29th. It is organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, and 63 people have registered to participate, including 56 men and 7 women.</p>
<h3>Second Student Swimming Competition; Held at Hongchi from 9:00 AM This Morning; Divided into Three Groups: University, Middle School, and Elementary School, Male and Female</h3>
<p>In order to promote aquatic sports and cultivate new blood in the swimming community, the Municipal Sports Stadium held the second Shanghai Municipal Student Swimming Championship at Hongkou Swimming Pool this morning. 115 people participated, and these students came from various schools at all levels, and some came from as far away as the capital and North China. As summer goes to autumn and summer vacation is about to end, this large gathering of young men and women on the water is far more valuable than the athletes' competition. This morning's competition is divided into university and middle school boys, university and middle school girls, and elementary school boys and girls, and starts at 9:00 AM sharp, rain or shine. At that time, people and fish will be swimming through the waves, and a lively scene will unfold, breaking the silence of the pool in recent days. The top three winners in each event will be awarded exquisite medals, and those with excellent results will be given special awards. Ms. Li Yuehua, the daughter of Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau, will be invited to come to the pool to give awards to show her support.</p>
<p>It has been found that in the registration list for the elementary school group, a middle school student has impersonated a replacement. This behavior is not only immoral, but also hinders the progress of the children. I hope that the impersonator will withdraw voluntarily, otherwise he will be reported, his qualifications will be revoked, and the guidance office of his school will be notified.</p>

<h3>Engagement Made in Childhood; Both Men and Women Agree to Dissolve</h3>
<p>Chuan Hua asks: When I was ten years old, my parents arranged an engagement with a certain gentleman. Now that both of us have reached adulthood, for the sake of our future happiness, we have decided to dissolve the engagement. After I expressed this opinion, the other party did not object, and also said that they have no objection to dissolving the engagement and let me handle it freely. Recently, they sent another letter asking me to obtain a "letter of opinion agreeing to dissolve the engagement" so that they can publish it in the newspaper. After I received the two letters, I did as requested. However, several months have passed, and I have not seen it published in the newspaper. I have also sent a letter to them requesting a similar "letter of opinion agreeing to dissolve the engagement," but I have not received a reply. Now I have several legal questions, please answer them for me. (1) Can the gentleman's letter stating that he has "no objection to dissolving the engagement and lets me handle it freely" be used as evidence that he agrees to dissolve the engagement? (2) If the above two items can be used as evidence, is it legal for me to publish a notice in the newspaper dissolving the engagement in the names of both parties? If I unilaterally publish a statement in the newspaper that the engagement is invalid and then send a clipping to the gentleman, is that legal? (3) Does a unilateral statement in the newspaper necessarily require proof from a lawyer? If it is necessary to have a lawyer's proof but I cannot afford the huge cost, are there any other remedies? (4) After publishing the notice in the newspaper, is sending the newspaper clipping to the gentleman considered to be the completion of the procedures? (5) Since the gentleman has stated that he has "no objection," does that mean that he has waived the right to claim "damages"?</p>
<p>[Mr. Tang Mingshi answers] (1) You stated in your question that the engagement was made at the age of ten. According to the Civil Code, a man must be at least seventeen years old and a woman must be at least fifteen years old to enter into an engagement (Article 973 of the Civil Code). Entering into an engagement at the age of ten is within the prohibited scope and should be considered invalid. An invalid engagement means that the engagement is not established. (2) To avoid worldly misunderstandings, you can unilaterally publish a notice in the newspaper declaring that the engagement is invalid according to the Civil Code, and there is no question of dissolving it. (3) It is not necessary to hire a lawyer to publish the notice in the newspaper; however, if the situation is complicated or the legal principles are unclear, it is advisable to consult a lawyer (i.e., a legal expert) to analyze and explain it. (4) There is compensation for damages only if there is negligence; if there is no negligence, there is no responsibility for compensation for damages. (5) An engagement that is originally invalid is clear once it is declared. Even if it is not declared, it is not binding.</p>
<p>This relief fund is specifically designed for those who are orphaned, widowed, disabled, elderly, weak, poor, or sick. The application procedure is to prepare an application form, describe your background and family situation, have it certified by the local Baozhang or Lizhang, and find a shop guarantor to register and mail it to the Social Services Department of this newspaper for review. Those who are found to be true after being investigated by our staff will be given subsidies as appropriate.</p>
<p>Recently, prices have risen sharply, and the amount of subsidies has had to be slightly increased. The original funds are about to be exhausted. We hope that enthusiastic readers from all walks of life will be compassionate and generously donate to give comfort to these fellow compatriots in distress and rekindle their courage to survive. This is what the colleagues in this column earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>(Opinion from Hu Zhijue, Fuzhou Road)</p>
<p>Your bureau receives telegrams from 11:00 AM to about 3:00 PM. Because the senders are crowded and the handling of the fee is troublesome, it takes more than two hours to wait, which is contrary to the principle of fast telegram service. I would like to offer two suggestions: (1) Calculate the number of words and various items in the heading, and clearly notify the method of filling in the form. The sender can calculate and fill in the form in the newspaper heading, and the business staff only need to check and issue a receipt to save procedures. (2) Issue telegram price coupons in the same way as postage stamps. The sender can paste them, and the electricity bureau can stamp and verify them at the collection office. This can avoid the trouble of collecting cash and reduce waiting time.</p>
<p>(Answer) Thank you for your valuable suggestions, which we deeply appreciate. We have long paid attention to the first point, and we have recently added the filling method of the heading and the calculation formula of the telegram fee in the new price list so that the sender can calculate the fee and fill it in by himself. However, it is bound to be unsatisfactory at the beginning, and our bureau will do its best to publicize the telegram sending procedures and fee calculation methods to make up for the above shortcomings. As for the second point, because the nature of telegrams and letters is different, the former calculates the fee by word, that is, the telegram fee increases or decreases due to the number of words or the type of telegram. It is not as simple as the latter, which calculates the fee by piece. It is currently difficult to implement the issuance of telegram price coupons. Our bureau is currently working with the Bank of Communications to jointly study the issuance of a telegraphic check to replace cash. It will be implemented as soon as the research is completed.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>Talking About Falseness</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>The most complicated and difficult thing to investigate is politics. According to today's chemical knowledge, we know that a certain amount of hydrogen plus a certain amount of oxygen will inevitably result in water; with today's astronomical knowledge, we can predict when there will be a solar eclipse and when there will be a lunar eclipse, even if they are far away in the sky, without any deviation. But only politics, which is most closely related to human beings, still has no precise principles to follow. Thinking about the rise and fall of dynasties, and whether a certain policy or action of a certain official in history was a merit or a crime, later generations have different opinions. Even those who have thought deeply and studied extensively for years are still unable to reach a definitive conclusion today. Speaking of today, and saying how a policy or reform will be effective, it can be decided in a few words, who can believe it? Reading the grand theories of famous officials in the past, we often find that what they discussed is inconsistent with the subsequent development, and when they were published, people admired them. Judging from this, what is the value of today's grand theories, we can think about more than half of it.</p>
<p>The reason why political theories are difficult to obtain accurately is that people cannot be selfless; if they cannot be selfless, their words will inevitably be false. Because people are members of the group, and they cannot speak about group affairs without adding their own selfish opinions and prejudices, purely from an objective perspective outside of themselves, as if observing the actions of the world from other planets. This is almost impossible. Su Shi's poem "I do not know the true face of Mount Lu, only because I am in this mountain," refers to this. It is better to observe the celestial phenomena far away in the sky clearly, and the rock layers deep in the ground can be measured and surveyed clearly. But when it comes to arranging one's own affairs, it is like a blind person catching a black cat in the dark, it is absolutely difficult to be sure.</p>
<p>For example, some of the roads in this city are like bloated thighs suddenly turning into skinny heron legs, some are arranged in a triangle, and the houses in them are like reefs at sea, and some are curved like bows or crossed like kudzu vines. The shapes are not only ugly, but also contribute to the various inconveniences in today's traffic. The reason for this is only because the landowners at the beginning insisted on every inch of land and would never easily make sacrifices. Therefore, if you elect a landowner to manage road affairs, you cannot expect him to be completely selfless and purely consider the matter. Broadly speaking, when people in the group talk about group governance, the degree to which they cannot completely forget their own private interests may vary, but in nature, it is no different from the landowner's management of road affairs.</p>
<p>Also, the most precise science is numbers. One plus one is always two, and no one will say it is three. But the "cost of living index" a while ago was nothing more than a mathematical problem, but it was often the subject of debate among people from all walks of life. On the day the index was released, some thought it was too high, and some thought it was too low, and there was a lot of discussion and no consensus. The reason is that it is related to private interests, and the discussion is different; on the boss's side, one plus one is best still one, and on the employee's side, one plus one is best three. As for those who compile the index, they are not gods high in the clouds, and it is not surprising that there may be biases or imbalances. Therefore, today's human beings have the intelligence to manufacture smooth-running machines, but there are no good policies in personnel matters to prevent friction between labor and capital in manufacturing machines.</p>
<p>It can be seen that politics is very difficult, but people think it is the easiest. Ignorant people are not worth mentioning, but even intellectuals often think of something and casually talk about politics. They praise those who are beneficial to themselves to the sky, and arbitrarily slander those who are harmful to themselves. Their recklessness is no different from that of peddlers and hawkers. Those who do not understand astronomy rarely dare to talk about astronomy, and those who do not understand geology rarely dare to talk about geology. But now, whenever politics is involved, everyone thinks they understand, and old and young can talk about it. Even scholars who study astronomy and geology often blame those who are not experts for talking about astronomy and geology, and are surprised that they are presumptuous and overestimate their abilities. But when it comes to politics, they all have their own set of high opinions. They not only think they can talk about politics, but also believe they can do politics. Their science is scientific in what they have learned, but not scientific in what they have not learned.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a set of science books. Among them, I found the natural science part quite enlightening, but the social science works felt like they were based on unfounded theories, and there was a big difference from reality. The author was a great Confucian scholar, not a mediocre village scholar. However, he was still false to such an extent, and I was deeply shocked. Therefore, I wrote down my feelings as above.</p>
<h3>The Editor Who Goes to Jail; Belgrade, the Capital of Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>In Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, every newspaper has a "jail editor." This is an editor hired by the newspaper to take the blame for the newspaper. If the newspaper publishes any remarks that offend the authorities, that editor will go to jail for the newspaper. If the newspaper publishes a signed article and that article causes trouble, but the person who wrote the article denies that it is his work, then this "jail editor" will stand up and admit that he wrote the article, and he will go to jail without any difficulty. But after he gets out of prison, the newspaper will give him a considerable allowance.</p>
<h3>A Single Action, Multiple Gains</h3>
<p>— Shuo Fu</p>
<p>Since getting married, I have learned some small experiences from my wife. At the beginning of our marriage, because we couldn't find a suitable servant immediately, and our current nanny, Yao, was still in the countryside and hadn't come to Shanghai, my wife had to manage the household affairs and also handle some household chores. Not only could she arrange everything in an orderly manner, but she was also able to make full use of her time. For example, when she was boiling water on the stove, she would take the time to tidy up the room or go to the market to buy vegetables. By the time she returned from buying vegetables, the water would be hot, and the room would be tidied up. After resting for a while, she could prepare lunch. When simmering meat or something else over a low flame, she could also find some spare time to sew on buttons or do some other small tasks. As a result, she accomplished many things in a day, yet she was not busier than others, nor was she any more tired.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "kill two birds with one stone." From my wife's work, I realized that the usefulness of "one action, multiple gains" is infinite. For example, recently the price of telephone calls has increased. Before making a call, I must first consider and decide on two or three things to discuss with the person I am calling. This could include: (1) inquiring about the address of another friend, (2) sending greetings to the other person, (3) agreeing to or entrusting the other person to handle something... Naturally, the more things you can think of, the more economical it is to use the telephone.</p>
<p>Another example is writing articles. When I see the editor of a certain magazine, I can: (1) give him the manuscript I agreed to write, (2) discuss the conditions for publishing a single volume, (3) pass on an article written by a friend... and so on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when I have time to read, especially when reading books about biographical literature, I can: (1) learn about principles of conduct and how to deal with the world, (2) find material for writing articles, (3) refer to writing techniques...</p>
<p>Someone said it well: the invention of the train shortened the distance between two places; the invention of the ship shortened the distance between two continents; the invention of the airplane shortened the distance of the entire world. The above focuses on space. I think anyone who can be familiar with the wonders of "one action, multiple gains" can also shorten the distance in time and make their personal life more fulfilling and meaningful.</p>
<h3>Also Recording the Recluse of Great Crane Mountain</h3>
<p>— Chen Yi Xian</p>
<p>In this column, there is an article written by Qian Dacheng entitled "Recording the Recluse of Great Crane". I will add this article based on what I know.</p>
<p>The Recluse of Great Crane Mountain's surname is Zheng, his name is Wenzhuo, his courtesy name is Shujian. He was knowledgeable in many fields, especially skilled in writing ci poetry. The world compared him to the ci poets of the Song Dynasty, such as Mei Cheng, Baishi, and Mengchuang. At the age of twenty (in the first year of the Guangxu era before the Republic), he passed the Enke imperial examination in Shuntian. After that, he took the palace examination eight times, all without success. In the 29th year of Guangxu, when he took the re-administered Xin Chou palace examination, the Recluse was already forty-eight years old. He gave up on pursuing officialdom and had a private seal engraved with the words "Retired Scholar of Jiangnan" to show that he had no intention of becoming a Jinshi scholar. In his later years, he purchased five mu of land in Xiaoyi Fang, Suzhou, and built a new residence, calling it Tongde Lane. To its east was a rolling hill, the old site of the Wu Xiaocheng city. He built a pavilion on the high point of the city, calling it Wu Dong Pavilion, surrounded by bamboo fences, with a very good view. Below it, a stream flows around, which is the Zicheng moat, also known as Jin Fan Jing.</p>
<p>The Recluse's ci poetry was as famous as that of Zhu Qiangcun. In his later years, Qiangcun also chose to live in Wucheng Xiaoshi Bridge, listening to the maple trees. The two ci poets often visited each other. Before the Republic, the governors of Jiangsu admired the Recluse's talent and reputation and invited him to join their staff, providing him with generous salaries and seeking his advice. Therefore, the Recluse lived in Wu for more than thirty years and became a master of ci poetry. After the establishment of the Republic, Confucian scholars were no longer valued by the world, and their livelihoods were shortened as a result. The Recluse then used his other skills to sell paintings and practice medicine, barely making a living for his family, and he often traveled between Shanghai and Suzhou. The price list of the Recluse of Great Crane Mountain was drafted by Zhu Qiangcun and several others. It is recorded below, so that one can learn about the Recluse's personality and his situation in his later years.</p>
<p>"The recluse Zheng Shuwen from Gaomi, whose later name was the Recluse of Great Crane Mountain, was unconstrained and unrestrained, and his friends from all over the world were famous scholars of their time. He lived in Wu for more than thirty years, calling himself a mountain man, and gave up on pursuing officialdom, declining repeated invitations. He lived in seclusion in the east of Wu Xiaocheng, cultivated a garden of five mu, and wrote books until his death. He researched and compiled the secrets of all aspects of learning, including textual research, textual criticism, ci poetry, phonology, medical classics, and meteorological treatises. He often used calligraphy and painting for entertainment in his remaining days. His brushwork was elegant and unrestrained, no less than that of Da Di and Xue Ge. Those who admired him often paid high prices for his work, and the paper in Jiangnan became expensive because of it. Now, to avoid the world by the sea, his comrades have urged him to imitate the old deeds of Banqiao Daoren of your family and draw up a price list to meet the needs of the world. This is also a way for virtuous people to make a living."</p>
<p>The Recluse passed away at the age of sixty-three (in 1918). The year before, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, the president of Peking University, asked Luo Dunxi to invite the Recluse to be the director of the Department of Epigraphy and Paleography and also serve as a school doctor. The Recluse wrote a reply to Luo Dunxi, which is also recorded below. Reading it, one can see that the Recluse was extremely stubborn even in his old age and poverty.</p>
<p>"Last year, I read your letter with gratitude. You expressed your condolences for my deceased wife in detail, and I am very grateful for your kindness and benevolence. I am also deeply grateful to receive the generous contribution of three hundred gold coins from my old friend Ren Gong, which helped me in my urgent need to relieve the poor and help the unfortunate. I am overwhelmed with gratitude and will remember it deeply. Because I am weak and ill, I have delayed in expressing my thanks. I hope you will forgive me and convey my sincere feelings. I am very fortunate. My late wife's funeral is scheduled for a certain date, so I dare to inform you and respectfully request you to send it to Shanghai. I have been collecting books for many years and have suffered many hardships at home. Lately, knowing both life and death has only increased my pain as a commoner. Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Cai Yuanpei, inviting me to be the director of the Department of Epigraphy and Paleography and also serve as a school doctor, with a monthly salary of about four hundred foreign dollars. The treatment is indeed generous and generous. However, considering that I am a survivor of the fallen country, have been in the south for forty years, and am tired of traveling north, I am afraid that I will have difficulty adapting. Moreover, I have heard that the cost of hiring servants, renting houses, and buying rice in the capital is ten times higher than in the south, making it very difficult to live there. Seeing the changes in the world, how can I compare myself to the ancients? I have long been content with being decadent and free, so how dare I be a lecturer in the capital of the state? Practicing medicine and selling paintings to support myself in old age is my natural disposition. I am honored to be attached to the end of the contract and offer my humble contribution. I have not fully expressed my wishes, but only to tell you that I am in a desolate place."</p>
<p>When the Recluse was thirty-eight years old (in the nineteenth year of Guangxu), he took in Zhang Xiaohong, a singer from Wu Qu, and wrote a "Plucked Red Plum" ci poem for her. It is said that during the Song Dynasty, Wu Yingzhi lived in Xiaoshi Bridge in Wucheng and had a maid named Hongmei, so he named his pavilion after her. He once wrote two "Plucked Red Plum" ci poems, which spread among the people. The Recluse imitated them and named his collection of ci poems "Cold Red." Qian Dacheng said in his article "Recording Zheng Dahe": "In his later years, Dahe was down and out and often sat in a teahouse with an old concubine." Perhaps this was Zhang Xiaohong?</p>
<h3>Autumn Residence Feelings</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing, the clouds are illusory,</p>
<p>A bright lamp, the rain's atmosphere settles.</p>
<p>The sky is long, passing a hundred scenes,</p>
<p>The earth turns, obtaining a distant heart.</p>
<p>The stream's waterfall returns a cool breeze,</p>
<p>The mountain pines twist in the evening shade.</p>
<p>Choosing to live here, I am completely enamored,</p>
<p>Not envying the swallows nesting in the forest.</p>
<p>Idly talking about matters beyond the mortal realm,</p>
<p>Briefly planning for a leopard's seclusion.</p>
<p>Ashamed of a fragment of stone to mend the sky,</p>
<p>Departing the world in a single boat.</p>
<p>Who is confused by human affairs?</p>
<p>The mountain recesses have responses to inquiries.</p>
<p>Drunkenly sleeping, freely letting go,</p>
<p>The bell rings, marking the fifth watch of the night.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Before the Qixi Festival, an old centenarian in Beiping ascended to heaven (94-year-old Lu Jingben Qi). Before the Zhongyuan Festival, an old centenarian in Shanghai returned to his place (92-year-old Chen Xunlong Xiaoshi). In terms of age, old Lu was two years older than old Chen. In terms of official rank, old Chen was two ranks higher than old Lu. (Lu was the Director of Education, Chen was a Grand Secretary and Governor-General.)</p>
<p>Old Chen had a high official rank, long lifespan, and great fortune. After serving as Governor-General, he spent thirty-seven years in leisure and freedom in Chun Shen, which is what northerners call a "favored person." And the most rare thing is that he completed the three stages of: (1) revisiting the pool of learning, (2) re-attending the deer banquet, and (3) re-attending the Qionglin banquet. There are really not many old scholars who have achieved this, because the "re-" in "revisiting" and "re-attending" represents a long distance of sixty years. When encountering a year with the same stem and branch, it is called "one re-." The stem and branch must cycle every sixty years, so it is called Zhou Jia.</p>
<p>Old Chen obtained the title of "Xiucai" in the Ren Shen year of the eleventh year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, which is elegantly called "entering the official school," or "visiting the school," at the age of sixteen (the founding year of Shenbao). In the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was Ren Shen again, and there was a celebration of "revisiting the pool of learning." His former master Puyi specially issued a "royal decree" with the inscription "The Spring of the Pool is Long." Friends wrote many congratulatory poems, which were published together in the "Collection of the Spring of the Pool is Long." His own commemorative poem said: "I still beg the heavens for more years, the cassia register in the autumn breeze, the apricot garden in spring." The meaning is that he wanted to increase his lifespan and extend his years in order to wait for the second "cassia register in the autumn breeze" (that is, the provincial examination) and the second "apricot garden in spring breeze" (that is, the metropolitan examination). He was already seventy-six years old when he wrote this poem. Sure enough, the "reunion of the provincial examination" came the following year, which is also "re-attending the deer banquet."</p>
<p>Old Chen obtained the title of Juren in the Yi Hai year at the age of nineteen (Enke of the first year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty). According to the rules, if encountering the regular year of the previous examination, it is considered "reunion of the provincial examination." The previous examination of Yi Hai was Gui You, so in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, Gui You (that is, sixty years after Gui You in the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty), Puyi issued another "imperial decree" and awarded him the title of "Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent." He also had a poem: "The thorny courtyard has come again as a former guest, the grand banquet is reopened in the fair hall." This refers to the old classics. In the past, there was a grand "deer banquet" after the results were announced, where the newly appointed Juren and the chief examiner performed rituals. The old Juren of sixty years ago also wore flowers and red ribbons to "re-attend" the banquet, which was extremely lively. However, after the Qing Dynasty abolished the imperial examination, the "re-attending" of the old scholars had no possibility of real scenery, only the empty words of honor and praise, just to express their feelings.</p>
<p>Old Chen's Xiucai and Juren titles were obtained very early, and he was only nineteen years old when he obtained the Juren title, so the year of "re-attending" was not yet eighty. However, he passed the metropolitan examination in Bing Xu (the twelfth year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty), when Chen was already thirty years old. Then, "reunion of the metropolitan examination" would have to wait until the age of ninety (thirty plus sixty). It is rare for a person to live to be eighty, and it is even more difficult to live to be ninety. For example, Yu Quyuan (Yue) lived to be eighty-six years old, which is not short, but he only "reunited with the provincial examination." Quyuan wrote a poem when he was eighty-two years old to re-attend the deer banquet: "There is still a cup of wine from the Qionglin, can the spring breeze linger again?" He hoped to live a few more years and catch up with the grand celebration of "re-attending the Qionglin banquet." However, he passed the Jinshi examination at the age of thirty (Geng Rong year of Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty), and he would have to wait until the age of ninety to encounter "the next Geng Xu." Old Yu only lived to be eighty-six years old, four years short. The spring breeze did not wait, and this wish was in vain.</p>
<p>Old Chen was also proud of himself at the age of thirty (Bing Xu of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty). The year before last (the 35th year of the Republic of China) was again the old Bing Xu year, and he completed another major stage. Unfortunately, his former master Puyi was in a precarious situation, similar to the last days of the Song Emperor in "Wuguo City," and there was no possibility of issuing honors again. Then, the Chen residence in Shanghai the year before last seemed to have no interest in celebrating, which was a bit of a flaw.</p>
