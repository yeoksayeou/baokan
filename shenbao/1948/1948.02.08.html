<h3>美國務院正式宣布　將提長期援華計劃　數額約五億七千萬美元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日廣播：美國務院已正式宣布五億七千萬美元為援華貸款之新數字，但政府方面仍企圖在歐洲復典方案未貿行前暫綫貸款與中國。美國參衆兩院若干議員對此均表反對，衆議員周以德及其他議員多人咸主張立即援華。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕美國務院六日夜宣布，將請國會通過五億七千萬美元援華計劃消息傳抵此間後，官方咸表欣慰，同時認爲自張院長上月廿八日發表中國政府關於美國援華間題之群明，並陳述準備實施之主要財經改革十項後，美國政府援華之行動，顯較前更爲積極，雖截至深夜此間所獲報道仍欠詳盡，官方亦未獲正式報告，對美政府建議中之具體計劃尙不知悉，然無論如何，吾人目前需要外援為一事實，美國友人由於兩國悠久友誼伸出之援手，至堪感激，如此項建缺能得美國會支持早日通過，益以吾人業已籌劃成熟之自助計劃，本年情况自當大異。去歲現政府之主要目標，爲使行憲政府成立前得一良好之基礎，如張院長闡述之十項財經改革得由美援早日順利完成，金融漸趨穩定，財政可謀平衡，則行政改革與軍事改革必可繼之實施，甚或相輔而行，同底於成。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕美國務院六日晚正式宣布，國務院可能請求國會通過一項五億七千萬元援華計劃，此一數額，較四個月前馬歇爾首次估計之援華數額尙多二億七千萬元，並不能視爲獲得杜魯門總統批准之正式請求。國務院六日晚應參院外委會之請，吿該委會謂：政府將要求總額達九十三億三千三百萬美元之外援撥款（包括對華援助部份），　自四月一日開始，供最初十五個月之支用。美駐英大使陶格拉斯（渠協助國務卿助理外援計劃）致函參院外委會主席范登堡，列舉對各國援助數額如下：包括於總統所提預算撥款之第一類為：　歐洲復原計劃六十八億元，　佔領區行政及救濟十四億元，　菲律賓之戰爭損失復原及退伍軍人福利一億三千三百萬元，最後一項業獲國會通過。第二類包括對華及其他援外撥款，此類總額為十億元，其中七億五千萬元，包括於總統所提出之撥款預算內，餘二億五千禽元，為總統即將請求國會通過者。第二類中包括對華援助，對希·土軍軍援助，陸軍部所提出之對日韓復原援助，泛美軍事合作及對的里　斯　之援助，後四項總計在五億元以下。陶格拉斯謂，對華援助計劃已有長足之進展，渠可指出國會可能被請求通過對華撥款五億七千萬元。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕美駐英大使陶格拉斯，代表國各部致參院外委會主席范登堡函所槪述的援華計劃，乃長期援華復興計劃的「發動機」，陶格拉斯估計援華計劃　費　或為五億七千萬美元，然渠又聲明，此數並非代表已經杜魯門總統批准之正式要求，在五億七千萬元中，四億七千萬元將用以購買糧食、棉花、汽油及其他原料，其餘一億美元，將用以購改良中國工廠用之機械。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕共和黨四人委員會擬於八日晤范登堡，討論變更歐洲復興計劃，范氏希望於三月一日向參院提出援外法案。</p>
<h3>貝祖詒在美商談　我改革幣制貸款　樓桐孫稱新幣將為金本位</h3>
<p>〔合衆社甫京七日電〕全經會秘書長樓桐孫七日語合眾社稱：貝祖詒正與美政府商談三億元至五億元間之貸款，以作爲中國新幣制之正金，此項貸款與外傳爲五億元之美援無涉，美援係用於平穩經濟局面及建立改革幣制之基礎，預料當能大有功用。五億元之貸款不惟可以促成經濟之穩定，抑對反共軍事有極大之價値，談判貸欲係貝祖詒任務之一部份，貝氏並携有多種改革幣制計劃，可擇一提交美政府，供其考慮。考慮中之新幣制，大約爲金本位，而以銀幣作爲輔幣，美國若干方面主張通貨純以白銀爲本位，在中國不能通行。</p>

<h3>怎樣平衡國家的預算？</h3>
<p>在這幣值低落，物價步漲的時候，單把預算作數字上的研究，其意義自極有限。所以本年上半年度的國家總預算，雖經正式公表，卻並沒有能引起大衆廣泛的注意；同時，立法院審核之時，大家也抛開了這些數字，而另從一般的財政政策上聚中研討，這是勢所必然的結果。</p>
<p>舉例來說：普通歲入歲出，都列爲二十六萬餘億元，其中歲入部份，共計十五個項目，雖說俱是經常收入，相當可靠。但照去年的物價指數看來，其上漲率已達到十四倍；在這惡性通貨膨脹之下，物價上漲，必逐月加速，而各種貨稅的估價，盡管按月調整，力求追隨，終趕不上物價的漲度。何況有許多項目，如國營事業的盈餘，罰款及賠償，捐獻及贈與等，未必能按照從價稅的，按期予以調整。所以這一部份的收支，亦未必能完全相抵，如當局之所估計。至於特別歲入項下，所列　款磾八億，按諸去年美金公債之成績，其可盡程度，究有幾何，益發費人思量了。</p>
<p>假如支出隨物價而意外增加，收入以茫無把握而大大減少，則其自然的結果，勢必至增加發行，以彌補虧空；而以增加　行的結果，又勢必並刺激物價，從耐支出，增加赤字。如引輾轉循環，互爲因果，將來決算的裂縫，空到如何地步，實在無從預計，亦著實令人可怕。</p>
<p>在這共匪擾亂，戎馬倥傯的時候，上項裂縫，如果按照通常辦法，要求以減少支出的手段來彌補，恐怕是一件不可能之事，所以惟一的補救辦法，除了增加發行以外，只有再行增加收入，平衡預算，捨此別無他途。所謂美援一項，截至最近爲止，其數字已經公佈，計爲美金五億七千萬元，確比從前傳說中的三億爲大。但其內容如何，迄執筆時止，還同有詳細報道。究竟將來能否移用一部，彌補預算，如果可能，能否在本年上半年度即行動用，又兩院討論時，能否照案通過，有無增減，亦在不可知之數。所以這個裂縫，倘要避免發鈔，還得自力更生，自想辦法。</p>
<p>本諸有錢出錢的原則，所謂財産捐一項，遠在抗戰時期，早已人同比心，認爲是非常時期的正當措施；去年又曆經討論，製成方案，似已事在必行。預計推行結果，其收數亦必大有可觀，因爲這是含有強制性的，完全以定戶爲對象的，除了財政上　急作用以外，還寓有平均財富的意義在內，大家認爲是天公地道的。不料幾經遷延，至最近忽又中途變質，改辯所謂救濟特捐。雖然同是一種特捐，但其性質已變爲樂捐了；其用途又限於救濟事業和賑卹難民了。其結果如何，現在雖尚難料，但在彌補預算，增益國庫這一點上看，其效用已屬有限；因爲歲出項下，並未列有這個項目。其社會部主管部門，其總數雖列爲一千一百四十一億元，我們相信：其中用於救濟和賑卹的，其成分恐未必很大。</p>
<p>其次，則載汰駢枝機關　　而減不必要這支出一項1。於去年二月十七日所公佈的經濟緊急措施辦法中，早經列入，今就預算表而論，其中有沒有這項措施在內，當然不看不出來；但就當局最近的展佈上來看，顯然沒有大刀闊斧，把這事見諸實行的徵象。又特別歲入部分，關於國有財産及物資的　價，列入十六萬五千億元，佔是項歲入百分之三.六八，而在普通歲入部分，亦列入一千二百六十七億元，佔是項歲入百分之〇.四七六，兩項總計，爲數亦不算很小。但以種種原因，所有國營事業的出售，似科別有帝制，至今還沒有辦理，過去如此，將來能否積極失去，頗難令人深信。何況敵僞産業和物資，其容易價賣的，早經變賣一空，所剩下來，究竟在這半年之內，還能夠價賣多少，尤其渺茫。至於國有事業的收入，在普通部只列得六億元，在特別部列營業收入四萬五千四百八十三億元，，這些數字，縱使十分可靠，亦似科不如一般人之理想。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹和法幣貶值苦楚，一般人確已夠受了。在民間，生産萎縮，生活困難，已顯露著活不下去的景象，而在政府，提襟見肘，左支右絀，亦已到了水盡山窮的地步。現在虛收實支，赤字龐大的事實，既明明地擺在眼前，那麽，爲維持現狀，避免財政上與經濟上的惡化加深起見，實在不容不努力設法，增加收入，節減支出，以力求預算的平衡，雖說　掘俱窮，點金乏術，是共見共聞的事實，然而財政困難，和經濟瀕危，並不單是我國爲然。試看英法諸國，其赤字數目的龐大，和國民經濟的枯寂，何嘗不驚心怵目，陷於極度艱難的苦境？所不同者，他們總辦法，有勇氣，除了大舉減政以外，在幣制上，物價上，外匯上，生産上，消費上，和國際貿易上，不惜忍受一時極大的痛苦，以與惡劣的環境相搏鬥，而我國則因循敷衍，將頭憋足，始終拿不出整套的辦法來。有了辦法，　動用國外存款，吸收僑匯，徵由財産捐等，又畏首畏尾，瞻顯太多，使不出澈底的手段來。似此無計劃地敷衍下去，只靠著增加發鈔來度日，靠著些支離破碎的聚爭措施來應付目前，這恐怕不單　　家以預算無辦法，而整個的國民經濟，其前途也是暗淡異常。</p>
<p>不過話得分兩面說，政府固有政府的責任，而國民亦未嘗沒有國民的責任。在這萬方多難，禍迫眉睫的時候，爲國民的，如果依舊醉生夢死，毫不覺悟，一味地在投機，囤積，逃稅，逃避資金中討生活，對於一切法令，又祇知規避，取巧，勾結，無弊，不肯奉公法，與政府推誠合作，那麽，縱有良法美意，濟時良方，亦恐　淮爲枳，收不到預期的效果。大家很清楚，一切稅收的中飽舞弊，上下其手，乃至漏稅走私等情弊，斷不是稅吏一方面的事，一切經濟管制的變質，走樣，利少弊多，最後乃至於完全失效，亦決不是官廳一方面的事。須知赤禍蔓延，生靈塗炭，覆巢之下，豈有完卵？相反地，納稅能力愈高的人，其所遭荼毒虛殺亦愈甚，而　家愈富有，享受愈豪華，不法利得愈多的人，其目標亦愈鮮明，愈無從逃避。所以國民納稅的義務，切盼大家毋再逃避，共同肩荷起來，爲國庫增一分收入，即爲自身輕一分危險。尤其是一般豪門大賈，富紳鉅宦，以及一切發國難財，發投機財的人，對於救濟特捐，國家捐獻，以及一切正當捐稅，均應以身作則，盡力輸將，以紓國家之急難，並以平民衆之積憤，這實是平衡預算的惟一辦法。要求避免發行的增加，其道在此；而要求物價的安定，民生的昭蘇，乃至一切公私經濟的好轉，其道亦即在此。</p>

<h3>阿拉伯聯盟考慮英國　締結中東防禦協定　整個里比亞獨立要求重提</h3>
<p>〔路透社開　七日電〕七國阿拉伯聯盟理事會今日起在此舉行為期十日之會議，英國與阿拉伯國之關係將爲討論主題之一。理事會並將考慮由阿拉伯聯盟與英簽訂中東區域防務協定，使阿拉伯國毋庸　英個別簽訂協定之意。一般預料聯盟理事會基於下列原因，將試行規定對英的肯定政策：！歐洲東西集團間關係的愈益惡化；　共產主義在中東之伸展；　伊拉克拒絕英伊新約後的發展。惟政界人士復認阿拉伯國內部意見尙未一致，故阿拉伯聯盟是否得與英國簽訂區域防務協定，尙有懷疑。若此一建議不能施行，理事會或將考慮更動阿拉伯聯盟之　草，使各會員國於與任何強國談判前，須經聯盟之批准。此外阿拉伯聯盟並將考慮巴勒斯坦局勢之四大政治問題：　聯合國巴勒斯　委員會抵達聖地後，聯盟所將表示之態度；　對安理會可能派國際軍赴　地事之政策；　巴勒斯坦阿拉伯政府之未來；　猶太人在各阿抗伯國內之地位。此外所將考慮之問題，有美國在的黎渡　設立空軍基地，里比亞之未來，及叙利亞脫離法　集團後與黎巴嫩之經濟爭端等。</p>
<p>〔路透社開軍七日電〕據悉阿拉伯國家已個別向四强外長會議提出內容相同的照會，要求使整個里比亞（的波里泰尼亞及西倫奈加）獨立，反對在該地設託管制。</p>
<h3>西歐聯盟計劃前途尙多暗礁　比荷盧希望與泛美公約聯繫</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦七日電〕外交觀察家稱：歐洲各國對蘇聯畏懼之增加，或將這使貝文西歐聯盟之計劃夭折。英國方面雖一再強調貝文計劃並非對付蘇聯者，然北歐各國似已接受莫斯科之觀點，認爲西歐聯盟乃對付蘇聯者，且爲向戰爭跨進一步。比荷　三國似乎僅在彼等與英法等國有同等表決權之條件下始允許參加。</p>
<p>〔路透社瑞典六日電〕瑞典外長恩登今日聲稱，瑞典準備參加西歐聯盟，惟必須以此一聯盟計　係以根據瑞典可支持的馬歇爾方策，使西歐從事合作為其十要目標為條件。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎六六日電〕可靠方面息：荷比　三國對於英法建議依照英法在鄧扣克所訂盟約之方式，締結五國盟約之議，採取極保留之態度。荷比慮政府已非正式表示，不甚願意加入僅以針對　國爲目的任何協定，並表示希望擴大任何此等盟約，以與一九四七年九月三日在裡約熱內盧簽訂之汎美互助公約樹立聯繫。荷比　認爲在政治上經濟上團結西歐之觀念，必須包括西德，因此締結針對德國的防守公約，不足以助西歐聯盟之目標，且將對之有損。至於荷比　之主張與汎美互助公約樹立聯繫，係因三國認為任何西歐組織，最後必需要美軍國事援助之故。</p>
<p>法願參加關稅同盟</p>
<p>此間法外交界人士表示，法國始終贊成使荷比慮參加關於德國之一切討論。消息靈通方面相信，荷比慮必將被邀參加二月十儿日在倫敦舉行之英美法三國會　同時法國現正與荷比　三國討論成立關稅同盟之可能性。法國已將法義關稅同盟協定草案向荷比　提出，聞荷比慮表示對此　甚感興趣，惟覺實現之時尙不乏困難耳。</p>
<p>貝文外和重申　證</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕貝文外相今夜在紐西蘭紀念節晚宴席上發表演說，保蹬英共和邦諸國均將支持組織西歐聯盟之建議。他說，「西歐國家已裂成若干小集團，西歐國家之觀愈亦念趨狹小。吾人茲已提出更廣大更勇敢的政策，在吾人提出該政策及發展該政策之際，西歐國家可知英共和邦一體均將支持此一以促進舊大陸和平及安全爲日的之偉大努力」。</p>
<h3>克里浦斯稱英鎊不貶值　美貸僅數一月之用</h3>
<p>〔路透社愛丁堡七日電〕財長克里浦斯今日在此向蘇格蘭儲蓄委員會會議致辭，聲明政府目前毫無使英鎊貶値之意。　〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕英國今日續自美國貸款中支取一億元，今在英國向美所貸之總額三十七億五千萬美元中，已僅餘一億元，預料最後之一億元，當於下月初即將提取，彼時英向美貸款即將全部用　，距英美貸款協定之批准爲時正十八閱月，而距馬歇爾方案之實施，至少亦尙有一月。此間財政專家預料　　爾方案茍不於本年四月一日實施，則英國於四月初起將不得不加緊出售其存金矣。</p>
<h3>法內閣批准　開放法西邊界分三階段進行</h3>
<p>〔路　社巴黎七日電〕法內閣業於今日批准分三個階段，重新開放法國西班牙邊界。二月十日起先行恢復　運及客運，二月二十五日起恢復　運。第三階段開始後，即由兩國進行談判商務條約之締結。第三階段何時開始未曾宣布。按法西邊界係於一九四六年二月經法國基於外交理由而予以對閉，重新開啓之談判，係於去年九月開始舉行，直至本月五日始在馬德里簽訂協定。</p>

<h3>保鼓勵猶太移民　英嚴重抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕英國爲猶太非法移民自保加利亞之黑海港口，源源前往巴勒斯坦事，已於上週六向保政府提出最嚴重抗議，此事至今夜始行發表。英照會於指出英國前此就猶太非法移民自保啓程前往巴勒斯坦事，已一再向保警告後，並日，英海軍最近　獲之猶太非法移民船「汎約克」號及「汎克萊森」號，即係自保國布迦斯港啓碇。照會議指出聯合國機構已曾一再呼　請各國　茲猶太　拉伯兩國即將　生的緊要關頭，避免任何足以使巴勒斯坦局勢更　惡化的任何行動。項政府認為保國如有加入聯合國之誠意，應熟習該聯合國機構之活動，及聯合國會員國應　之義務。照會最後指出英政府所得結論，乃為保政府若非故意鼓勵猶太非法移民之自保前往巴勒斯坦，即為保國　官員已犯有嚴重的錯誤。</p>

<p>〔聯合社漢城七日電〕朝鮮南部今日發生於壞鐵路與電綫事件多起，據美佔領軍當局宣稱，其目的蓋在迫令聯合國朝鮮選舉監察會退出韓境。漢城東約三十哩火車一列出軌，各地並發現大批傳單，號召總罷工，要求美蘇佔領軍立即撤退，沒收並重新分配土地，將工業收歸國營，釋放政治犯以及交還政權予朝鮮人民。該項傳單並未署名，恐有左翼份子在幕後王使。美佔領區司令霍奇兩次接獲警吿，　將實行罷工三天，迫使監察會撤退。常局現已捕獲嫌疑犯廿二人。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖六日電〕聯合國機構秘書處今日宣稱，小型大會定廿四日開會，朝鮮問題列爲議程第一項。該會原定廿三日舉行，但因與華盛頓誕辰紀念避免衝突起見，特予展緩一日。</p>
<h3>阿拉伯民族堅決反對　國際軍進入聖地　向聯合國機構提備忘錄</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖六日電〕阿拉伯高級委員會今日代表巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人正式通知聯合國秘書長賴依稱，聯合國機構企圖分洽巴勒斯坦，將被視作一種侵略行動·美代表團與英國政府實施之壓力，全係政治上的恐嚇。阿拉伯人堅決反對派遣任何國際軍隊至聖地執行分治。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕美財部宣稱：本會計年度盈餘卅二億五千八百八十七萬八千八百廿一美元，幾達杜魯門總統所預計之盈餘（七十五億美元）三分之一，實創一新紀錄。</p>
<h3>人造雨試驗成功</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺七日電〕此問在六日舉行人造雨之實騐，頗爲成功。飛機昇至七千至一萬三千尺高空後，自積層雲散下重五萬公斤之冰塊三袋，數分鐘後，近郊旱區即得甘霖一吋許。</p>
<h3>美參院定下月一日起　討論馬歇爾方案　范登堡預測三月底可決定行動</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓六日電〕爲計劃中歐洲復興方案提供美國援助之法案，將於三月一日提出於參院討論，此係由參院共和黨政策委員會今日所決定，該會負責排定各法案提出之程序。</p>
<p>參院多數黨主席塔虎脫於宣佈該案將在參院從事討論之日期時，曾預測參院將於三月十五日以前，採取最後行動。衆議院舉行討論之確定時間則尙未宣布。衆院外委會憶於星期四日結束對於該案之公開報吿會。該會主席范登堡稱：該會將於星期一日開始草擬法案。渠預測參院至遲將於四月一日完成行動，四月一日乃國務卿馬歇爾所訂之限期。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕六日所公布西德英美合倂區之經濟行政新德軍，已給予合併區內之德人以決定　經濟事務之廣大　限。設立西德德國聯邦銀行之憲章，由　英美與法國之談判尙未結束，故已展期發表，惟以三強為　　而成立此一聯邦銀行之希望則至爲濃厚。</p>
<p>英美合併區與法國區之專家正在柏林談判，以爲英美法三國代表於二月十九日在倫敦開會討論西德一般問題之準備。此間英美官員均力言昨日公布之憲章，僅擬以之爲臨時措施，俟德政府正式成立時，即當由其他法律取而代之。英美官員並聲明此一憲章，不得正式名之爲憲法，以其所規定者僅爲經濟時務。某一官員並指出此次改革的最重要「副產物」，乃爲德人之熟烈討論此項新改革已否規定太多或太少的中央集權，此項現象可以顯示西德民主意識的醒悟。</p>

<h3>片山內閣風雨飄搖　各黨爭奪政權　自由黨民主黨均擬組新政府</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京七日電〕迫在眉睫之日本政潮，惟未必將有何新發展，但各政黨則正在幕後水斷磋商，活動頻繁。外相　田領導之民主黨，以前一向以仲裁人自居，目下顯然仍將處調解者之地位。　田昨日曾透露一項計劃，擬排除極右派與極左派而集合中間派之政治力量，此殊堪令人詫異，聞右派政黨自由黨之總裁吉田茂，早在兩月前即已懷有類似之計畫，且已博得民主黨若干脫黨份子之擁護，至於社會黨似寗願內閣垮台而不欲該黨內部發生致命之分裂，在目前情形之下，現內閣一日垮台，則片山恐將繼任乏人，日本政黨情形之紊亂，實無有甚於此者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞肚東京七日電〕商相水谷在今日內閣會議後宣稱：片山內閣本週末不致垮台，片山現主張將政糊移付國會中之第二大黨自由黨，而民主黨則正忙於羅致黨員以期繼社會黨而組織新政府。故日本內閣危機今不復在追加預算案問題，而實由於政府各黨之自相分裂。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶錄　十四北美報業聯合會版權辦有本報編譯室</h3>
<p>一九四〇年二月初，總統在白宮中對我說，他想派　爾斯到歐洲的重要首都去跑一趟，看看有沒有和平的希望。他問我對這種辦法是否表不贊同。</p>
<p>（稍後，總統明白地對我說，　爾斯曾經秘密地到他那裏來了好幾次，懇請准他負着特別使命到國外去。原來　爾斯是要求總統在一九四〇年派他出去的，總統不過問問我對　爾斯這個任務是否有所反對，為了這個理由，我覺得頗為滿意。）</p>
<p>我當即回答說，假如他眞正要　爾斯出去走一趟，我並不表示反對。但是，我說，我要說明幾點。</p>
<p>我把最近幾星期中向總統說過幾次的一種觀點，重申了一遍。我說，「戰爭的緊急關頭幾乎就在眼前了。三個軸心國家已經建立了空前的軍備。希特勒，墨索里尼和日本的發言人已經無恥　在講，他們決心從事有限度的征服。他們堅定地毫無錯誤地向這個方向走，筆直像一顆槍彈。這種情形，是發生在從一九三三年到這一年。在孤立主義派反對的限度之內竭盡一切可能的努力去促進和平之後。」</p>
<p>我繼續說，在這種環境之下，世界旣已着火，軸心國家旣已準備就緒，簡直已經在用它們全副軍事力量向前躍進，再談和平還加上去訪問好戰國家，勢力引起　偽的希望。這種虛偽希望，對於目前正應該奮力準備自衛的國家和人民，特別來得危險；它們是不應該自滿於幻想中的地理安全或者中立的。</p>
<p>繼續彈奏從速實現和平的曲調，使一國人民留戀於一種虛偽安全感中的可怕影響，可以由當時英國兵士所唱的，「我們將洗好的東西掛在齊格菲防綫上」，這只流行歌曲淸楚地加以說明，但是我的確感到某種可怕的凶兆正在醞釀之中。</p>
<p>我並且說，對於　爾斯旅行的目的和結果，五百種不同的謠言必然會發生的。這些謠言，將在歐洲和國內造成混亂。</p>
<p>在戰爭這一個階級，我個人是不會考慮派韋爾其或者和他官方地位差不多的任何人到歐洲去祖任這樣一樁任務的。韋爾斯以爲在「假戰」雖在繼續進行的情形之下，仍不能爲和平找到若干基礎的。但是希特勒顯然正在瘋狂地用他唯一的方法準備結束「假戰」，這就是全面的激烈戰鬥，而停止他作這種準備的唯一方法，乃是給他所要求的一切東西。但是這等於納粹控制歐洲，而另一次戰爭是會在幾年之內發生的</p>
<p>二月九日，總統自已宣佈　爾斯的任務，說是在總統的要求之下，韋爾斯將訪間義大利，法國，德國和英國，其唯一目的，乃是就歐洲現行情形向總統和我提供意見。但是總統有我所提出的意思存在於腦際，所以力言韋爾斯並無權力以美國政府名義提出建議或者有所決定，凡是別國政府官吏向他提出的聲明，一定要嚴守秘密，　能由　爾斯轉達給他和我。</p>
<p>同日，我宣佈我們已經開始和其他中立政府開始非正式談判。我說明這種談判係就健全的國際經濟制度以及世界普遍裁軍作初步的探討。現行戰爭情形並不牽涉在內，但是作戰國家也可以包括進去，因這些對論是梵牽涉未來和平的兩個共同問題的。</p>
<p>我們那時已經發動盡可能規劃一個戰後世界的形式，以謀向其他國家和我國自己的人民提出，這些談話，就是這種探測和研討工作巾的一部份。</p>
<p>據我所知，　爾斯任務的宣佈，引起了許多謠言。總統雖然力說代表團不得有所決定，許多孤立主義者就借此機會鬧得天翻地覆，聲言我們即將牽入歐洲的爭端了。另外些人同樣確信韋爾斯一定有一個確定的任務，就是由協約國或我們自己以任何代價在歐洲實現和平。還有些人猜測總統和我以及韋爾斯和我意見上發生了分歧。爲了鎭定這些謠言起見，我在二月十四日發表了一個聲明說：</p>
<p>「我想總統和我對於我國外交上的政策和方法，幾乎和担任我們同樣職位的任何兩個人一樣一致。在我們舉行討論和會議之後，先由總統宣佈派往歐洲的特別代表團，其後由我自己宣佈了有關戰後經濟恢復和裁减軍備的問題，當時並沒有發生失常的事情。」</p>
<p>其後，我向　爾斯致意，表示讚揚。</p>
<p>韋爾斯由國務院歐洲司司長莫法德（Jay　Pierrepont　Moffat）作伴，訪問了羅馬，柏林，巴黎和倫敦。他看到了每一個政府的領袖們和敎皇庇護十二世，和他們詳談。他把有關我們以貿易協定計劃爲中心的經濟政策的備忘錄，交給他們，這種政策，是我們希望在戰後採取的。他則接到了他們對於戰爭的長篇大論的意見，一味爲自己辯護。</p>
<p>雖然他信守總統的訓令，就是人家吿訴他的一切束西都嚴守秘密，但是謠言總是跟蹤而起，沸沸揚揚。這些謠言使協約國和小中立國充滿了驚恐，深怕總統在韋爾斯回來之後會採取和平行動，而這種行動，在戰爭這一個階段，勢必會承認希特勒大部份的收獲並且使另一次戰爭無可避免。結果，總統和我同意，由他發表一篇演說，以謀驅逐這種恐懼。因此羅斯福先生就在三月十六日從白宮向基督敎國外工作人員大會發表演說：</p>
<p>「今日，我們在找尋和平的一個道德基礎。假如不能理解兄第之情，就不能有眞正的和平。假如和平的結果是壓迫，或者飢餓，或者殘忍，或人類生命爲武裝營陣所控制，就不能有持久和平。假如小國必須在畏懼强　的情緒　生活，就不能有健全的和平。假如免於侵略的自由被出賣，作爲犧牲，就不能有道德的和平。假如否定自由交換思想，務使人類　致共同立塲，就不能有符合理性的和平。假如崇拜上帝的權利被否定，就沒有　義　和平。」</p>
<p>爲更　一步　　這些危險的謠言起見，我於三月十八日送給總統一個備忘錄，並附以我擬發給當時在羅馬的韋爾斯的一個電報草稿，「促其特別謹愼。」總統在備忘錄上用鉛筆寫了「OKFDR」。就在同一夭，我發電報給光爾斯，說我已向報界表明他的任務純粹是調査事實性質的，他不能在一個交戰國與另一交戰國之間祖任調停人或渚參加任何談判，不能設想他可以對根據武力威脅的任何和平建議或者有時限的哀的美敦書表示意見或有所行動，我以爲除了向我們提供情報之外他不能接收任何和平條件。韋爾斯在離開羅馬之前向報界發表了一個聲明，說明他並沒有接受或者傳達任何和平建議，他的佗務僅僅是在收集消息。</p>
<p>三月廿日，英大使洛齊安來看我，對於總統和我在他認爲是能及時使政府採取行動，阻止並且驅除「以任何代價尋取和平」情緒的蔓延這一點，表示感謝。據他說，這種情緒，導源於有關韋爾斯可能在歐洲造成由談判實現和平的各種謠言，而如此的和平無異是德國的勝利。他說，凡欲經由談判而實現和平的努力，可能損書英國和法國的戰局。我向表明一點，就是在最近幾星期中我們從來沒有忽視過整個問題的最細微方面，並且準備在適當的時光　量把我們的立塲表示淸楚。</p>
<p>當　爾斯在三月底回到華盛頓的時候，他把他和墨索里尼，希特勒，達拉第，張伯倫，敎皇以及他們的外長所作的談話，向總統和我提出了一個極完備的報吿。恐怕沒有一個人可以從他們窺探到更多的消息的了，但是他所獲得情報，並不能給我們任何行動的根據。和他談過話的領袖們，並沒有給他和平的希望。總統在三月二十九日發表了一個聲明，認爲當前縱使極少任何公允和平的展望，但是　爾斯所彙集的情報無疑是有最大價値的，在將來可以樹立和平的時機到臨之時，當有用處。但是根據以後事實的證明，甚至這個聲明也太樂觀了一點。和平的時機有五年多沒有來，而來的時候，在一九四〇年領導英，德，義政府的人物已經死去，而當時法國政府的首長，也已經不再在職了。</p>

<h3>行總職員舞弊案續審　調查處長提供重要證言：指出許多措施不符規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總高級職員被控舞弊案，昨日地院刑庭繼續審訊，自下午二時起至六時許始訊畢，結果各被吿仍交原保，證人飭回。黃光鈺庭長升座刑一庭後，即飭傳各被吿到案，昨日報到者有侯藹昌，董承道，胡可時，蔣仁麟，龐元龍，杜岑，鄧仲和等，被吿專員火永彰，陳惆民，陸家駒，科長陶景　，營造商丁天生等未到，證人到有行總調査處長高淸孝，慶豐紗廠總經理唐星悔，申新三廠經理榮一心，行總專員倪克定，科長黃蔚靑，張子惠。中紡副總經理吳味經則派代表到庭。主要被吿侯藹昌之供詞，大都同答「不知道」，或「不淸楚」。證人中調査處長高淸孝之證言，對於將來該案之發展極有關係，茲探錄其證言大意如次：行總高級職員被控舞弊案發生後，行總即派高調査該案內幕，關於同人福利舞弊及電風扇配售舞弊部份，係由高單獨調査，棉花換紗舞弊部份，高與胡毓寅合作調查。高嗣樓述七點：　蔣仁　於任福利科長時，擅自挪用該科備用金五百美元，經調査該項備用金係準備後方工作人員復員來滬住旅館之費川，挪用修理房屋，殊有未合。</p>
<p>接受傢具不知去向</p>
<p>瑞豐里行總職員宿舍中，初接收時內有責重傢具甚多，嗣後不知去向，僅剩破爛器具。　行總規定凡五百萬元以上之公款，均須簽准後始能動川，且投標時須有登記證之營造廠商始有資格，査修理宿舍及購買傢具用去二千餘美元，旣未經合法核准，而專員火永彰介紹之營造商丁天生，並未登記，亦非正式商人，自屬於法不合。　購買傢具其價格均超過當時市價。按稽核室規定，購買物件須經投標及比較，但購買該項傢具時，旣未經投標，又不比較。在丰續上亦有未完備之處。　宿舍內電器冰箱是有的，但非行總傢具。</p>
<p>配售電扇。數字不符</p>
<p>電風扇配售問題，按行總規定，署內同人不許購買救濟物資。據高調査彭無荒曾私舊三十餘架，渠曾提出檢舉，此後據渠所知，電風扇曾經過秘密出售，停止配售，公開出售三階段，且發表數字與實際數字亦有未符。　關於棉花還紗變換比率問題，因有來往賬册可稽，究竟誰吃虧，誰討便宜，一查即知。高陳述畢，由其他證人陳述一過，至六時許庭上以該案尙需調査，論知改期再訊。</p>

<h3>飛虎傳將蛻變　中航央航反對向政府提抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕陳納德主持之行總空運　隊結東後，外傳將改組爲政府管制之半官性　　　司。頃悉，中國及中央兩航空公司對此極表反對，　　向政府提出非正式抗議。兩公司負實人對於空運　隊在運　救濟品口實下所獲得之種種特權，極爲憤慨。例如：　中國中央兩公司購買之飛機汽油須付百分之五十進口稅，空運人隊則因其爲救濟機關而免納稅款。　空運大隊所獲得之公價外匯遠較中國及中央兩航空公司為多，因此可向國外購買較多之飛行設備，且因處於優先地位，故交貨甚爲迅速。但中國中央航空公司則往往須等候數月始能收到定貨。　本市虹橋機塲為空軍機塲，從未許中國中央航空公司利用，但空運大隊飛機則可在該機塲升降。　中國中央航空公司之營業收入中，須繳納一部份維持民航局經費，但空運大隊則無須繳納。　民航局禁止中央中國兩公司夜航，但對空運大隊則無權禁止，因此空運大隊日夜均可飛行，而所運之貨物與乘各比其能力多出一倍。在此種種情形之下，中央及中國航空公司在競爭上處於極不利之地位，故對空運大隊改組為民航公司決表反對云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據交通部息，該隊業經政府決定，特許其暫行存在一年，至行總結束後該隊隸屬及其在此一年內辦理航空運輸之各項問題，刻正在籌劃及向上級機關請示中云。</p>

<h3>醫學史上一奇跡嬰孩多指創紀錄　發育健全他無所異</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市立第二醫院少年產婦樂李氏，於一週前產下一男孩，發育健全正常，惟左手生六指，右手生七指，左脚生九趾，右腳生十趾，手族共卅二指，（見圖。本報攝）創醫學史上之駢指紀錄。經周密檢査，該兒身體各部及內　，均無特殊變異，懷孕及生產過程亦均順利。該院院長曾　仲，產婦科主任李炳先等醫師，對此嬰兒咸極感興趣，幷已攝成電影，以供醫學上研究。據該院內外各科醫師研究結果，認爲俟該孩稍大，即可將駢指完全割除，使與常人無異。院方對此母子，願擔任常年醫　顧問，俾使永保健康。</p>

<p>上述參加評選之廿二部影月，均係各公司去年雙十節前川品，去年年尾尙有佳片多種，因未及參加，將併入本年度評選。至於中獎之十部影片，該會已製就圓形金質獎章大小兩種，大型者十枚，將分贈各中獎影片之製片公司，小型者分贈各由獎影片之編導，主要演員，音樂，佈景，錄昔人員，每部影片得獎人以不超出十人爲原則。兩種獎章上均　有「中正文化獎金冊六年度電影獎」及「上海市文化運動委員會贈」字樣，金光燦爛，精美絕倫。該項獎章定本月十五日戲劇節在天　舞台舉行授贈儀式，翌日下午該會並將邀集各得獎人，及其他戲劇界人士，舉行一年一度之盛大觀摩表演。</p>

<h3>荷蘭僑胞　靑田·瑞安·寳安　有鼎足而三之勢　荷蘭之行第四信特派員毛樹淸</h3>
<p>〔本報海牙二日航訊〕海外華僑，有兩個大本營：南洋羣島和北美洲。我生平沒到過南洋，前年我在美國，我對於那些　路蘭　開天闢地而來的華僑，如今成家立業，有不勝敬佩之情。除此以外，恐怕便要輪到荷蘭，荷闌華僑有基礎，有辦法，而且有氣魄，在歐洲華僑社會中，荷蘭該是舉足重輕的一個區城。</p>
<p>荷闌僑胞大槪有一千左右。浙江靑田，瑞安兩縣和廣東寳安縣，人數是「鼎足而三」，這次立法委員歐洲區委員競選，在荷蘭情形非常熱烈。三位競選人，剛好來自三個不同的區域。同鄕關係有時候可以產生互助提携，互通有無的好處，但如果同爲選舉，加深了彼此的鴻溝，也是美中不足之點。</p>
<h3>裝載大批軍火拒絕駛往敵國</h3>
<p>僑胞沒有一個不愛國，在海外的僑胞談天，常常企望著祖國的溫暖。戰爭期中，荷蘭僑胞的其他許許多多國家的僑胞一樣，捐款，獻款，紛紛匯回到祖國。有位名呌張扳英的廣東人，戰爭初起時，在海船上任事。有一次，某艘德國運輪船裝載大批軍火，準備起椗直航日本，張振英領導中國「海員」，在鹿特丹的碼頭罷工，這件事，聽說後來鬧到納粹佔領軍司令部，要通緝罷工的領導人物。如今那位張振英先生，早已到了中國。</p>
<p>戰爭期中，有不少可歌可泣的故事，但也有許多茶餘酒後的趣談。納粹軍隊在荷蘭佔領了五年，那時候，運輸割斷，荷蘭的糧食非常恐慌，他們用玉蜀黍洋芋和其他雜糧拌和著充飢，這味道，當然是「食不下咽」，聽說有位姓林的華僑，携帶有一架做麵條的機器，是那時候全荷蘭唯一的一架，他每天把雜糧磨成粉，再製成麵條出賣，因此發了大財，有位海牙餐館老闆對我說：「別人也想作這項利市生意，但是雜糧粉太硬，沒有機器，用手工沒法變成麵條」！</p>
<h3>中國烹飪第一跟洋人爭飯吃</h3>
<p>現在，荷蘭有很多打麵的機器，也有大大小小幾十家中國餐館。據我的記憶，大槪海牙有九家，阿姆斯特丹有十家，鹿特丹（一譯洛塘）有三家。大餐館佈置的富鹽堂皇，祇有美國舊金山的中國飯館可以比擬。每天每家餐館的營業額，多至二千，少至五百，（折合美金二百至五百元），這數目就相當可觀。他們靠親戚朋友的餽贈與寄送，遠至南非·星加坡·澳大利亞，近至英倫。丹麥。都有食品運到荷蘭，走遍天下，烹飪莫勝中國，我們的辛勤僑胞，就靠這份「國粹」，在跟洋人爭飯吃。</p>
<h3>少數華商抬價違反政府法令</h3>
<p>除此以外，荷蘭僑胞很多經營棉織品生意，華僑從紡織工廠批發購買棉織品，然後再零售沽賣給用戶，我在阿奶斯特丹，曾經參加過一次棉織品商人的新年聚餐。飯後，有位被邀的荷蘭警察局朋友，對我們講有少數中國商人抬高零售價格，違反政府限價法令的話。那位荷蘭朋友還說到中國許多僑胞在荷蘭「賣糖」，似乎很不「體面」的話，也許他是好意和忠言，但貿然聽來，十分刺耳。那天餐後，我們有一個小小的談話，大使館一等秘書斯頌熙氏，除了分析僑胞經營棉織品的實際苦衷以外，而且還吿訴他：「中國現在擁有全世界最大的紡織規模，那就是中紡公司。將來交通方便了說不定有一天，荷蘭的大棉織商，要到中國去定貨。」。斯頌熙秘書還勸他們多留一份感情給中國人，將來總是有好結果的！</p>
<p>我曾經問過棉織業公會的會長余忠先生，他認爲：常前棉織業僑商的最大苦痛，是從工廠批不到貨，縱然批到，也不够多，因之，零售商，在無可奈何中，纔求諸於超過「限價」的黑市，進貨旣然超過限價，零賣當然被荷蘭政府所認爲「黑市」，因之，如何使廠方能增加中國僑商的批發數量？是全部問題的癥結。</p>
<h3>呂純陽百寳箱賣糖生涯鼎盛</h3>
<p>駐阿姆斯特丹的丁振武領事，那天還解釋了所謂「賣糖」問題的前因後果。我記得：在黄昏燈影下，我常常遇着那些身揹木箱，像「呂純陽」的百草藥箱一樣。「靠山吃山，雜水吃水」的我拉的僑胞。</p>
<p>荷蘭的僑胞社會中，至少，現在已經有那麼一種自覺：喫飯固然重要，但爲爭取國家的體面，更爲重要。「制止賣糖」的意見，在許多僑領社會間彼此流傳著。另外一個奇怪的現象，是海牙阿姆斯特丹都鬧「工荒」，巾國餐館招請不到中國堂倌。有位餐館老　對我說：「做堂倌一個星期四十盾，一個月最多嫌到一百六十盾，賣糖的如果生意好，一個禮拜天，可以嫌到一百塊荷盾」。他還加了一句說：「莫小看賣糖的啊，他們回家把衣服一換，呂純陽的百寳箱一丟下，個個都穿得漂漂亮亮呢！」</p>
<h3>社會環境複雜敎育水準低落</h3>
<p>我沒有詳細研究這個問題，但是，我知道：華僑社會，有時候有意想不到的複雜和環境。更因爲歐洲僑民的敎育水準，一般槪括的說，比較美國為低，而歐洲的什麽「官價」，「私價」「限價」又特別複雜，今天張三因爲賣高價被「捉將官裏去」，明天李四家裏的五担白米忽然又被沒收，……諸如此類，打仗以後這兩年，歐洲遍地皆然。若干僑胞說外交官不做事。領事館說僑胞不懂得所在國的法律，言語講不通，再加上領事館沒有那麼多的人力與財力，能够件件交涉順利。</p>
<p>在歐洲，荷蘭在這一方面的情形，比較算好。但因爲僑胞多，一個領事館相當的忙不渦來。美國法闕比利時，在阿姆斯得達姆和鹿特丹都有領事館，美國而且有總領事館。如果我們能在鹿特丹開領館，或者擴大阿姆斯特丹的領館為總領事館，在機構和人力上，常然更能替僑胞多服務。此外，僑胞的匯款，限額倘能獲得荷蘭政府的同意增加，對國計民生都有好處，我雄議中國銀行應該在荷蘭設立一個小小的機構，承辦一千僑胞的僑匯。這點意見，我在一九四五年初次遊荷蘭時，曾經在重慶「世界日報」寫到過，這次來，仍然有相同的感想。</p>
<p>蔣鼎文將軍來荷蘭的時候，曾經非常忠懇勸僑胞戒絕烟賭，實際上，荷蘭僑胞在這方面比較的少，尤其是海牙，可以說絕對沒有。阿姆斯特丹有位年靑的僑領，主張由「華僑聯合會」設立　樂部，獎勵下棋，平劇，或玩彈子等等，來代替賭博，這是一個非常積極的意見。華僑聯合會是荷蘭華僑的大結合，現任會長是山東僑胞馬文山先生。</p>
<h3>下一代中國人　沒機會學華語</h3>
<p>我和馬文山先生談到過「僑民敎育」問題，可惜的是全荷蘭現在沒有一座華僑學校，許多「下一代的中國人」，沒有機會學習中國話。據馬文山氏的看法，如果國內能派人來荷闌主辦，籌欵不至有多大問題。鹿特丹有位僑　囊華說：去年有位英國留學生，性劉，四川人，自動跑來荷頸值驕設立學校，並且答應他本人任激，鹿特丹的華僑都異常興奮，　款，校舍，基金，一切都籌備停當，不料那位劉先生忽然趕返倫　，從此一去無消息，學校的事就無形作罷。</p>
<h3>荷蘭玩童警察槍斧殘害僑胞</h3>
<p>僑民敎育影響到華僑社會的一切行動，在荷闌，眞正能看報，知道國家大事的，除了幾位僑領以外，還是不多。戰亂前後，許多僑胞，遭受無妄之災，就因爲他「懂」的太少，聽說海牙一個華僑，於戰爭結束前被推入水中淹死。貝納特親王行宮附近的赫弗遜小鎭上，一位賣糖的浙江華僑蔣光鶴，被三個未成年的荷蘭頑童，用斧頭打死，現款全部被刧奪。另一位名呌張岳良的華僑，住在烏得勒支城，被一個自稱荷蘭便衣警察的暴徒，用手槍擊傷大腿，後來死在醫院裏。諸如此類的故事，在戰爭結束前後特別的多，那時候是兵荒馬亂的局面。</p>
<p>聽說：德國軍隊沒有退出荷蘭以前，華僑在荷蘭，相當的尙能安居。謠傳說一度到過中國的德國福根霍森將軍，在他出任德軍駐荷比海岸總司令的時候，曾經多次下令保護華僑的生命財產。還聽說有位住在聖達姆城（阿姆斯特丹附近）姓陳的華僑，娶有猶太婦女爲妻，生育二子。德國兵佔領荷蘭期間，凡猶太人殺無赦，而獨獨這位姓陳的猶太老婆倖免。</p>
<p>那時候，華僑們在荷蘭，有一個呌做「華僑互助會」的組織。所有的中國僑胞，都是反抗法西斯的有力工作者。一九四五年德日投降以後。荷蘭華僑的慶祝勝利「龍燈大遊行」，是歐洲史上有名的光輝的一頁。荷蘭的華僑有氣魄，全荷蘭的僑胞，每一個都是愛國家，愛民族，愛戴領袖的。我祝福他們康健！（於哈列遜飯店）</p>

<h3>海品淒涼商市迷茫</h3>
<p>〔本報海南島三日航訊〕擁有五六萬人口的海口市，這幾個月來表面上是繁榮了，骨子裏却蘊藏着悲哀。臘月將盡，年關屆臨，商塲遍佈着一片灰色。市商會理事長毛澤海，一天在大同酒家招待記者席上，這樣地描摹着說：「三十六年度行將過去，回溯這一年來的海口商塲，都是在極度困難中掙扎，尙未能恢復戰前的狀况。在經營方面，每一家生意，國幣的數字雖然增加了若干倍，但是與其說是盈利，倒不如說是虧本。尤其是糧食商，九八行，藥材行，都面臨了不景氣。</p>
<p>「幸而能够站得住的只是土產商人，本島的土產外銷，最大宗的是牛皮，樹膠兩種。但是，營業雖可勉强維持，却又飽受稅收機關的留難。拿樹膠來說，本島樹膠原來是土產，政府爲獎勵出口，過去曾規定免稅的，然而，不管法有明文，主管機關仍然征收土膠百分之七的出口稅。又譬如椰油出口也是免稅的，現在，油是免稅了，裝油的桶，反要納稅。諸如此類的問題，都像一根鐵索那樣，束縛着海口商人的發展。</p>
<p>「其次的一個問題，便是舖主和舖客的問題。商人中十分之九是舖客，常常因爲業主隨意推翻合約，把租値增大很多倍，或利用勢力，强迫停業搬遷，法律裁判，等如具文，頗使海口商人心灰意冷，痛苦到極點。」</p>
<p>「目前，海口商塲的最大危機，厥爲受到外來資金的壓迫。拿海口最大的商店來說，最高資本額不過是四十億左右，但最近由京，滬，穗，港，各地前來本市經營土產業的，大約有五六家，每家資本額都在二三百億以上。大資本壓倒小資本，所謂大魚吃小魚，海口商人是走頭無路了。」</p>
<p>這一席沉痛的話，充份地繪畫出當前海口商市的輪廓。</p>
<p>過去，在海南改省呼聲喊得最響亮的前後，大多數的商人都懷抱着一顆充滿希望的心，拿出一點資本來擴充一下，驟看去，市面還有繁榮的影兒，使人稍稍感到了安慰。但是，改省的呼聲沉寂了，商塲也起了一個很大的轉變。最顯著的一個現象，就是除掉幾家較大的洋貨店，酒家，咖啡館，行莊仍舊是燈火輝煌以外，一到夜間，許多商店都燃起了一盞燒K水的　燈，全市昏黑，寒酸到極點。假如說他們要不起電燈吧，那可不是。問題是商業冷落了，夜間的營業，根本清淡得可　，與其多開一盞電燈，倒不如樂得「　節」了。</p>
<p>由於商業的不能繁榮，物價的高漲，敎育水準的低下，加上外圍匪患的嚴重，交通的不能暢達，海口報業的命運是相當可悲的。</p>
<p>目前海南島除了榆林有一家和平報的分版外，以海口報業最爲發達，計日報有大光，民國，平和三家，晚報有天行，世紀兩家，成爲全島民衆的眼睛。但是，社會購買力的貧乏情形，頗使人洩氣。據接近數字的統計，五家報紙的總銷數還不到五千份，其中以大光，天行兩家最爲流行，世紀因爲站不住，乾脆已於一月中旬停版了。說到廣吿方面，這本來是報社收入的主要來源，但是商塲不景氣，此路已吿不通。靠着支持經濟的只有報費，所以由一日起，日報每份由三千元提高到四千元，晚報由上月廿五日起每份由二千五百元提高到三千元，報費之高，可算全國首屆一指的了。這兒每份一中　二開的玉扣土紙便售到四千元，試問讀者如何可以担負得起？</p>
<p>韓專員下車伊始，首先顧到報業的困難，已呈請宋主任子文商准華南輸管會，在第四季白報紙額下配給十萬噸，分各報使用，這樣，海南島民衆僅有的一些精神糧食，大概可以得到救星吧。（本報通訊員陳梅靑）</p>

<h3>國際貿易促進會成立後　昨座談進出口貿易　擬請輸管會公佈每期限額分配數字</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市國際貿易促進會，昨日中午十二時半假都城飯店舉行成立後之首次座談，出席中外進出口商三十餘，由該會理事長沈畊原任主席。工作報告後，即就進出口貿易之具體問題，有所商討，發言者甚多，外商尤爲踴躍。納會員之意見，主要者如下：</p>
<p>對輸管會截止進；商之登記，深表不滿，認爲不但妨害工商業之發展，且與經濟建設之計劃抵觸。該會向輸管會訴願後，迄未獲得答覆；上月三十日經濟部商業司長鄧　良等來滬，亦曾談及此問題，現擬呈文經部，轉全國經濟委員會決定。　擬請求輸管會公佈每期限額之詳細分配數字，以減少外界之不滿與批評。　外貨之樣品與廣告品，希望輸管會能准其入口，　時口商請求輸入許可證，准于不准均有，希望主管機關能將准不准之理由向外界說明，藉使商人營業，能有所遵循。　中國過去缺少管理進出口之經騐，今日輸管會中，對進出口有實際經騐者亦不多；但巾國各業公會之組織則頗爲堅强健全，故希望今後管理雖由原機關負責，但實際工作之推動，交與各公會自辦。　中國半官性之商業公司，在美大量購貨，其享受之便利非一般私人公司所能望其項背；例如在美之一統公司，最近即在美洽購大量之化學肥料，此與各進出口商之利益，頗有妨害。　轍管會近頗獎勵我國工業成品外銷，但據外商之意見，自獲取外匯之觀點上，不如協助各出口商收購我國之土產外銷，較爲實際。因我國之工業目前尙在幼稚階段。</p>
<p>上海金管局局長李立俠氏，昨日亦被邀參加，即席致辭。大意謂：今日國際貿易之困難，一在於舉世缺乏美元，二爲中國在抗戰中農村受害頗烈，今因內亂之故，復興困難。金融局與國際貿易有關者，　在取締外匯黑市方面。金管局之政策爲取締工商業之不合法活動而保護正當工商業；一方面取締黑市外匯交易，並使外匯市價便利進出口貿易·座談會至二時三刻始吿結束。</p>
<h3>華股小型向榮：永紗跌風頗劇</h3>
<p>華股昨屬農曆年尾，最後半天交易，銀根更緊，殘多了結不已，人心並起若干恐慌，除小型股繼續向榮，內衣屢迫漲限外，永紗首當其衝，過程極爲不利。</p>
<p>最初以美貸消息而開低，開後恐怖性增加，永紗跌風慘厲，自六九二元及七二五元起，二二號等紛售即交，七六號等出遞交，塲外息價仍開三角一分半及三角六，跌至六七〇元及六九八元，二〇七號等進即交，一五二號等進遞交，內衣先掛漲停，永紗回升至六九六元及七二七元高價，九九號等均抛即交，五四號等出遞交，復退至六八〇元及七〇八元收市。內衣重掛漲停，小型股之鋒頭十分顯露，頗多向榮姿態。結果較前即交股計榮豐中絲商務中泥尙平，內衣漲停，五和漲半成，景福勤興新華閘北中紡微升，大通跌一成，信誼降半成，餘均小挫，遞交美亞平，永紗信和微降，新光景福勤興微升，外各未上市股票繼續平疲。</p>

<h3>中信局發表　最近豬桐油市況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局昨日發表本週國內外桐油猪　市况如下：</p>
<p>猪鬃</p>
<p>國外猪　價格疲軟，計重慶二七號黑配　漢口貨三元一角，上海貨二元一角五分，天津小五五黑配　四元七角，成交稀少。天津　因出口商抛售期貨，跌勢較烈。國內價格重慶二七號黑配　渝扎價每關擔三九〇〇萬元，連包裝　費　四二〇〇萬元，漢口　五〇五〇萬元。上海　四二〇〇萬元，天津小五五黑配　九二〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>桐油</p>
<p>國外桐油價格，因美國政府調査中國桐油銷美情形。據一般意見，以爲並未得傾銷證據，徵稅之議，可望中止。惟交易仍屬沉寂。紐約現貨每磅美金二角五分，裝船僅合散艙油每磅C．I．L．美金二角四分。倫敦貿方開價每長噸一七六鎊。國內各地油價均穩。上海因銀根緊迫，買主均未購進，每長噸盤旋於三二〇萬元左右，重慶一九九萬元，漢口二九五萬元。萬縣二二四萬元。梧州二六五萬元。廣州二八六萬九千元。</p>
<h3>粗細紗一致回升。棉布人心亦轉堅</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以春節休假在即，各方頗多從事了結，惟同業中頭寸寬裕者，乘機進取，喊價回挺。迨至近收，各方抵補頗　，散戶亦有跟進，市價邁步上揚。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗，比之上日回漲一百四十萬元，爲六千零五十萬元。全日趨勢，以廿一支雙馬棧單乏人問津，下挫七十萬元，及十支金寳星銷胃不健，步跌二十萬。其餘各支粗細紗，則大都回秀一·二十萬至六七十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開平穩，本街以結束期屆，門售及批發實銷均呈停止狀態，散戶及客幫採購寥寥，業中銀根軋緊者，現貨套出頗多，行情曾見疲軟。迨至近午，以春節休假關係，紡建公司已暫停開售，人心轉堅，本街稍有抵補。結果十二磅各細布，以五福交易活潑，及龍頭回漲四千至一萬三千元，此外漂布及士林布，則回升四五萬元，其餘各布均仍平疲之勢。</p>
<h3>滯港羊毛原料廠商請准進口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕羊毛原料第四期進口限期額現已決定，各廠之分配亦吿完竣，已向國外分別訂貨。至於第四期進口限額前之額久限額，月前已分配完畢，即以自備外匯之抵埠羊毛抵充，共計三百萬美金，但迄今為止，廠家雖分得限額，而貨物尙未到手。各廠因原料不繼，深感問題嚴重。其所以未能得貨之原因，爲自備外匯貨物中之羊毛原料，大部尙在香港，而政府之年理條文中，規業在港貨物不準進口。現悉各毛紡織廠已向公會要求，即向輸管會請求凡在輸管會巳登記之在港羊毛，準予通融進口，以維目前各廠之生產，惟數量則不超過三百萬美金。公會定一二日內，即推代表謁霍主委寳樹，而陳該業之苦衷。另據有關方而透露：自備外匯羊毛原料之已抵本市者，約値一百三十萬美金；而留港待運者，則値一百七十萬美金，佔大部份。</p>
<h3>捲烟肥皂飛漲</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，因銀根鬆弛，同業抵補甚暢，新買活躍，本街門莊號胃口依然特健，行情續見上漲。迨至最後，十支大英老刀兩烟繼漲二百五十萬至二百二十萬元，其餘中外各烟亦均步升五六千至二三萬元不一。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，以門市走銷奇暢，買戶更爲股切，籌碼不充，行情暴騰不已。結果固本箭刀兩　續升十二三萬元，此外光華美麗祥茂等，亦均步秀五六萬元，火柴火油去化亦活，美　聽裝同業互做八十五六萬元，桶貨七百二十萬元有人買進。</p>

<h3>災難的歡息</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>住在上海里弄的人家，一年總有好幾次遇見挨戶募捐的事，其中出家人也有，俗家人也有。而募捐的方式，大槪和尙道士之類不外是黃紙捐簿一本，「隨願樂助」四字；至於俗家人便花樣多了，有的近乎挜賣，有的變相攤派；新派一些的，則口號標語俱來，惟能度也比較「文明」，多少使被捐者樂意一些。</p>
<p>和尙道士化緣式的募捐，原是由來已久，地不分東西，凡是宗敎性的事業，大概都得靠善男信女們的捐助；但在我們這個一年四季多災多難的國家中，救難性質的募捐運動，可說是年年不斷，不是某處旱魃，便是他處水災。單是去年一年中，南有兩廣水災，北有蘇北水災，其他小規模的天災，更恐難以數計了。</p>
<p>不過單是天災也還罷了，因爲單純的天災終還有盡頭的日子。但在我們這個國度裏，所有的所謂「天災」實在都是人謀不臧的結果。試問連年兵荒馬亂，在三十十歲左右的人，又有誰曾活過太平的日子。幼時聽人講「長毛」時代如何如何的可怖，但我相信將來的歷史家寫到中國近代史的一章時，那洪楊時代恐怕倒不免呌人有些神往吧。</p>
<p>人禍天災交相爲虐的結果，更產生了一種「社會災」。社會災這個名詞也許是我個人所杜撰，但却是實在的。譬如像難民捐，淸寒學生的助學捐，甚至防疫防癆，以及各種以「義賣」方式出之的慈善基金勸募運動，都可以歸之於「社會災」的一類。不過有許多人祗稱之爲社會問題罷了。然而社會問題而必須靠募捐的方式來求解決，你就不能不說這是一種災難。</p>
<p>誠然，因爲社會本是一個羣的幽體，人類彼此都有互助的責任，所以募捐的方式，不一定反映着災難的意味。例如在歐美社會，除宗敎事業等類的慈善募捐外，其他學術性和文化性的募捐工作亦極普遍。像美國的許多私立大學，就多半是靠私人的捐助維持的。據說曾有一個美國人以一塊錢長期儲蓄銀行中，預備百年後供作某大學的基金。這也許僅是一個逸聞，但也足證富如美國社會，募捐的行爲也很普遍。</p>
<p>不過同是募捐，人家的募捐　半是屬於建設性的，是有希望的。一個學術團體由捐款產生了，一個大學靠捐款維持了，光輝的學術成果和人材的培養，使一塊錢的捐款收回了十塊錢的效果。這才眞是以羣的力量解決了社會問題，不，應該說是建樹了社會事業。</p>
<p>可是我們又怎樣？不提也罷，提起了就該愧死！做一個中國老百姓，一年得負担多少救災性的捐款（間接或直接的），恐怕誰也統計不了。但究竟有多少被難者是眞正被救「活」了？有多少社會事業是靠募捐的方式建立起來了？讀過最近各報訪問上海冬令難民所特寫的人們，大概都能答覆。</p>
<p>我們的老百姓是世界各國人民中最好說話的，他們從來不去顧問這些事，他們旣出了錢，自問已對得過良心。至於別人怎樣去支配這筆錢，他們管不了。可是國際問對於捐助中國的觀念，却就不這樣簡單。例如聯總最近曾發表過一篇戰後兩年來給予中國的捐助數字（總計二十億餘美元），因而對中國兩年後今日每况愈下的情勢，就不免嘖有煩言了。馬歇爾在述及援華問題時，也表示過中國不比歐洲各國，美國的錢用在中國而能收獲七成效果，就已經算是了不起了。至於其餘的三成會到那裏去，馬歇爾雖沒有說明，你我難道就長此不聞不問麽！</p>
<h3>與有榮焉</h3>

<p>「我明白，」新聞記者接着說。「可是請你關照開慢一點，好讓他們知道同你在一起的是什麽人。」</p>
<h3>「療愚靈藥」補</h3>
<p>— 均</p>
<p>二月四日自由談載銅駝君「療愈靈藥」一文，講述一種從蛋白質里提煉出來的「格魯泰克酸素」對人類智力的作用。「格魯泰密克酸素」這名詞，對一般讀者恐怕十分陌生，其實它的鈉鹽，就是我們早常應用的味精。</p>
<p>「格營泰密克酸素」一名「麩氨基酸」（Glutamic　Acid），小麥和大豆的蛋白質里，都有豐富的含量。製造味精方法之一就是甲監酸來水解麵筋。</p>
<p>用「麩氨基酸」來治療愚病，其服量還沒有一定的標準。試驗報吿中有高到日服廿四分的，也有日服十公分左右奏效的，吃得太多會使人失眠，所以要有醫師的指導才可用它來療病。</p>
<p>人的消化系統能夠分解蛋白質爲各種氨基酸，所以吃含有「麩氨基酸「的食物或味精，其功效似應和吃「麩氨基酸」一樣。不過治療愚病，服量需要相當的大，單靠普通膳食里的一點含量恐是不够了。</p>
<h3>再生皇子</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>聖雄甘地，慘遭謀害的新聞，早已傳遍遍全球，薄海同悲。據最近電傳，遺灰已散入恒河，於是非武力主義，精神感化等等將成爲歷史上的記憶。假如目擊聖雄火化，想到一個在數十天前還創導絕食以籲請印回息爭的老人，就這樣化爲　埃，不免要感到惘然若失的吧。而聯想的思索便是，這一代聖哲會復活嗎？當然不會的，他的遺體已經化爲灰　了。然而在印度的確有一個復活的皇子，事情並不長久，幕啓於四十年前，到前年夏末才吿終塲，乘此追悼聖哲之餘，讓我們在心理上滿足一下，特記述這復活故事如次：</p>
<p>印度孟加拉省有一王國菩華（Bhowal），皇太子羅埃（Roy）於一九〇八年五月八日不幸英年謝世。皇族中人，包括他的兄弟，妻子，和舅兄忙着喪禮，預備把遺體火葬。羅埃生前是一個風趣的人，接近平民，因此在大吉嶺街上隨之送喪的有數百人。雖然貴爲公子，他是一個良好的「調人」。</p>
<p>下午八時，送喪行列到達火葬塲。遺體放上木柴堆中，但在舉火之前，忽然下了一塲大雨。皇族中人和送葬者都跑到可以躱避的地方去避雨。</p>
<p>二小時後，雨已停止，他們回到木柴堆畔舉行未完的葬儀，但屍體已經不見了。</p>
<p>親屬趕快分成數隊去找尋。他們在黑暗裏撥開火葬塲的灰堆，但是找不到屍體的影子。城市每一處都在講起屍體失蹤的事，成爲印度第一流的神秘事件。</p>
<p>可是到了明天，據說屍體已經找到，送喪者又到火化的地點去。的確有一個憔悴的死屍橫在木柴堆上。樹枝一經燃火，儀式順順順利完成，沒有什麽不幸事件發生。</p>
<p>過了一個時期，羅埃的寡妻畢哈拔提，黛微（Pibhabati　Devi）招他自己的兄弟來管理丈夫的遺產，這份財產每年有近五十萬元美金的收益。平民都不贊成這種竊國的行爲，而寡妻的兄弟呢，酷尙歐化，只是政崇　裁而已。</p>
<p>十二年後，有一個住在山洞裏的印度敎僧侶，蓬苜垢面，腰纏粗布，在菩華城裏蹀踐。一個淸道夫偶然看了他一眼，再瞧上工瞧，於是跑到到到街上去散佈着消首……皇太子復活轉來了。</p>
<p>菩華市民驚奇於此一事實，都聚攏來看這個奇怪的人物。他們向僧侶發問。但他拒不作答。大家從他的膚色，頭髮，眼神上證明是業已逝世多年的皇太子：有的參與葬禮的人則以譏嘲的語調說：「我還看見屍體化爲灰燼的」。</p>
<p>「你只見一個屍體火化罷了，「信仰者反駁着。「你還記得在葬之夜，貴體是失蹤過的嗎？」</p>
<p>菩華城裏分成兩派主張，一派以舅兄爲代表，向英常局報吿，說是有一個騙子自稱為故皇太子。他們把故皇太子火化，已有事實證明；另一派堅主這來歷奇特的僧侶是華埃本人。不過僧侶却並不曉曉爭辯，倒是驚動了寡居的太后，要去一訪這復活的親生子。她爲了不信自己的眼力，特先到眼科專家那裹去檢査一下目光。</p>
<p>當她一看到僧侶，立刻抱住了他。「是我的兒呀！」她堅決地說。後來她想到檢查他身上的瘢痕——一蛀牙，一顆痣，還有皮膚上的創瘢，都是很好的明證。</p>
<p>羅埃的姊姊請這靜默的僧侶去吃飯，親自入廚，揀他生前歡喜吃的小菜燒好。佾侶吃得津津有味，姊姊含着淚水擁抱住他，「你是我的弟弟」，她說。「你記得你歡喜吃的小菜——而我記得你的吃相！」</p>
<p>姊姊慫恿他宣佈是太子羅埃，如其僧侶不答應這樣做，不惜以餓死爲要挾。僧侶無可奈何，只得在這晚上跨象出游，鼓樂前導，宣佈他是菩華皇太子。於是發生了公開的鬥爭，今羅埃向法院控訴，請法律來裁判他爲合法的钜額財產的繼承者。</p>
<p>其時為一九二〇年。初審時法院裏人山人海，傾聽今羅埃講述他的故事——</p>
<p>在火化的一晚，當火化者去避雨時，他躺在木堆上被暴雨淋了一小時。於是被火塲下面巖穴中居住着的印度敎人發現了屍體，搬到下面來，把淋濕的包布撒除，監護着，在神火前祈禱。三天之後，他恢復理智—復活了，可是記憶全失。</p>
<p>他和敎徒一起生活，十二年中遍歷全國。他偶然成爲僧侶中的沙彌，於是有一天恢復了他的記憶力。</p>
<p>「人是菩華皇太子，」他說。僧侶們以爲他仍發着精神錯亂症，但是他監決要到菩華城裏去</p>
<p>來法院作證的人聚訟紛紜，莫衷一是。羅埃妻子則堅決反對，不承認他是丈夫。</p>
<p>這件案子一共打了二十六年官司，尙不能裁決，，一直到一九四六年夏季，此案在英國最高司法機關倫敦樞密院開審，經過法官周密審議，判決他是羅埃皇太子。今日的僧侶，回復到昔日菩華皇子羅埃的身份，親戚故舊，紛紛向他道賀。可是三天之後，羅埃嘔血滿地，破曉之前即行物故。</p>
<p>過不多時，就是在三十八年火葬的塲地，菩蕪皇太子羅埃的遺體再度焚化成爲灰燼，這回是確鑒無疑了，而且未降暴雨云。</p>
<h3>陸稼書詆王學</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜</p>
<p>李剛主雖不主朱陸學說，然詆朱較詆陸尤甚，故於宗朱子之學者，亦攻訐不遺餘力。淸代以陸稼書（　其）最崇朱子，其斥王陽明亦最烈。（至有明之亡，不亡於流寇而亡於陽明」之言。）剛主恕谷外集，載稼書刊「王學質疑」佚事，閱之極堪發　，亦陸淸獻毁　陽朋時之趣聞。特錄之於次：「陸稼書任靈壽，邵子昆任淸苑，皆有淸名。而稼書以子昆宗陸王，遂不相合，刊張武承「王學質疑」相詬厲。及征喀爾旦，撫院命稼書運　塞外，稼書不知所措，使人間計子昆。子昆答書云：些須小事，便爾張皇，若　辰濠大大變，將何以處之？連將「王學質疑」付之丙丁，則儀之荒計出矣。」此雖調侃稼書之書，實切由書生之病，稼書宜無所置喙。世之輕議古人者，往往易蹈此失。今「王學質疑」坊間猶尙流行，讀之者其亦思及有此一段公案否？然李剛主亦頗有意於事功，欲以自見，而終不得當以一試，假使誠有用之者，不知其較陽明何如？而勝稼書又幾許也？不禁爲之葬爾一笑。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<h3>第十章　自願犧牲（六六）</h3>
<p>綺紈一聽毓如提到這問題，不由臉色一變，說這：「據渚齊告訴我，他已輕和他太太離婚了　「毓如道：「渚齋爲愛你，也許可以辦到這一層，甚至瞞着家庭已經辦了，可是在　式家庭，不能容許他這樣辦。我責問他，他受了刺激，也許出走，和你到外埠去，可是如此一來，那麼我夫婦暮年受此刺激，是擔當不起的，我一個家庭，因此緣故也就毁了。我刻苦一生，　老之年，還要受此苦痛，　小姐—請霞身處地，替我想一想，難過不難過？」毓如說到這裏面容慘淡，老淚縱橫，兩手不住顫抖。綺紈原是心熱而軟的人，一聽毓如說出影響他的家庭，如此嚴軍，覺得這問題很棘手退坐椅上，咬着嘴唇，緊緊眉頭，沉疑語。毓如老於世故，一看綺紈如此神氣，知道可以真情激動她，於是站起來，對綺紈道：「我知道我對你們青在人說這些話，未必能入耳，不過我深信顧小姐受過舊禮教洗禮的，絕不是那種時髦小姐，祇顧限前快樂，不管以後如何結果。就說你和渚齋二人，願意結婚，我也無從制止，如此一來，我　老喪失一個兒子，渚齋成家之後，喪失一　老親，這種精神苦痛，是無法補償的了。顧小姐，你是在大家庭生活過的，應該知道我爲家長，身處其境，是如何爲難！你二人愛情，我相信是很純潔，很高尙的，只是如此一來，在你方而，沒有名分，是很大的損失，在渚齊方而，他運背父母意向，在外面加組小家庭，也同免不了親戚疵議，在我老夫婦方面，撫育兒子成立，家庭所得這樣結果，還有什麼與趣呀！這婚姻算不算美滿，有無遺憾，顧小姐是絕頂聰明人，又是名門閨秀，其中利害，一定看得很明白。我今天很希望顧小姐給我一個表示，果然顧小姐認爲我所說的都無足輕重，那是我德不足以服人，言不足以取信，那只有和我老伴，聽天由命，隨你們幹去，我絕不會來阻止，將來我也不負任何責任。」毓如說完，顫巍巍站在綺紈面前，靜待答覆。綺紈給毓如如此一說，心裘非常紛亂，緊蹙眉頭，一手扶住頭，默然不語。</p>
<h3>最賺錢的生意</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>這世界上最賺錢的生意是發行郵票。</p>
<p>據美國集郵界的統計，單單在美國一國，「郵迷」即達一千一百五十萬人—其中有六百萬以上是十幾歲的孩子們。每發行一次新郵票，在美國就可以凈賺到一千五百萬美元，在一九四六年一年中，美國人民化在集郵上的錢就達四千五百萬美元。一九四七年雖尙無完整的統計，但是因爲美國通貨膨脹的關係，預計一定還不止此數。</p>
<p>利之所在，自然大家趨之若驚了。有許多人就趁此機會，想出了許多花樣。甚至於美國政府，據說也曾發生過不乾不凈的勾當。在羅斯福總統推行新政的早期，華府有幾個頗有地位的」名流」，和郵政部裏的幾位高級人員無意中談起了集郵問題，他們有意無意地提起：祗要在印刷郵票時把少數稍爲印壞一點，立刻就可以成爲郵市珍品，譬如說，如果有少數郵票忘了在邊上穿孔，馬上就會得身價十倍。</p>
<p>果然，不久之後就有二十種美國政府「印壞」的郵票流到了華府某些「名流」的手裏—政府官員中得者也頗不乏人，羅斯福總統也收到了這份「禮物」。</p>
<p>這些「禮物」漸漸流通，有一個冒失的「圈內人」把自己的一份交給了一個郵票掮客，呌他以最高價出售，而那份郵票保險値就達二萬爲元。集郵界先是大感詫異，後來就憤然要求澈究這種郵票的來源。議會中質詢不絕，逼得當時的郵政總長（而且還是全美民主黨主席）法萊祗得宣布把這二十種「忘了在邊上穿孔」的郵票全部照票面價値出售。然而美國政府並未吃虧，這一批郵票開始出售後，政府在一年內凈賺了二百萬天元，使郵務部在政府各部門都鬧虧空之際獨有盈餘。這種「壞郵票」現在已在集郵界自成一類，稱爲「法萊票」，有人猜測說，這是素以絕頂機警著稱全美的法萊一手造成的傑作，靠此一筆生意，渡過了財政，的離開。</p>
<p>有許多小國根本以發行郵票為唯一源，如自由談前幾天發表的一篇「新桃源記」裏說起的監喜教士坦就是。此外，還有聖墕裏諾也一樣，它們的郵票售給外國人收藏的比國內消費量多達二十倍。以賭城蒙的卡洛著名的不國馬那哥，阿比西尼亞，捷克斯拉夫，都以出賣郵票給外國人爲大宗出口生意。</p>
<p>比利時的著名物理學家比卡德敎授是以同溫層探險著名的，他這幾次探險的經費就是由發行了一種郵票而來。挪威飛行家亞孟森在一九二五年首次試飛北極的時候，也完全虧得郵票帮了他的忙才吿成功。</p>
<p>不幸，郵票有時也成爲侵略者的靠山。在第一次大戰後，義大利的「詩人政客」鄧南遮就利用發行郵票的盈餘，帶兵佔領了阜姆。一九二○年，波蘭的齊里古斯基也全藉郵票之力，强佔了立陶宛的維爾諾。</p>
<h3>談冬裝</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>一入冬季，男女服飾大致起了一點外形上的變化。一部份穿西服的男子，如其不是「死硬派」，早已在寒風將起時改穿中服，寬袍大袖，甚溫暖舒適，迥非穿西服者所能享受。自從都市裏盛行着室內裝置火爐。或水汀之後，中裝袍子外面也得穿一件大衣，以便外出受寒。這一件大衣，戰前與戰後發生了一些變化：即戰前以馬褲呢大衣居多，戰後盛行的是呢罩袍。假如三十年來男子服裝有什麽變化的話，要以呢罩袍革馬褲呢前衣之命爲最願著。女子呢她們一向在抗寒這方面比較男子厲害，這衹要看她們冬季仍穿一雙絲襪，除此之外，腿部別無禦寒的東西，就可明白。惟近年來，尤其是戰後，流風一變，娘兒們以穿小棉襖，西裝長褲的居多，不知是否近十年來的女性已經不復有她們母親　代這樣的杭寒性，因之非得在絲襪之外再穿一條難得有機會穿的長褲。鄙人忝爲昂藏七尺的丈夫，對於女性非但亳無歧視之心，抑且尊重女權，一如尊重雄鷄在早晨啼聲喔喔的權利，雖至驚醒我的好夢亦無怨懟一般，可是對於女性們之穿短棉襖與西裝長褲，實在不敢恭維。這種裝束似乎有非驢非馬的感覺，可惜鄙人缺乏考證興趣，否則倒可以從紅樓夢裏　人的服式，體實今日流行的女式短裝都有入十二金釵名下使婦的資格也。</p>
<p>從冬季男女服式的變遷，可以看出兩性的各趨極端。陰陽敵體在服裝上也看了出來。男性從馬褲呢大衣一變而爲罩袍，其愈趨簡單平易，是合科近日艱困的經濟環境的。因為謀生之維艱，不得不從各種事物上打算，因之衣服的裁剪，做工，無不一一打算，罩袍於是取大衣而代之了。女子服式，則與經濟環境的榮枯恰成反比例，即在經濟愈艱難時期，服式的花樣景又愈多，這筆費用，當然是兜過了幾個圈子之候，轉嫁到男子身上。。故曰，一個經濟窘迫的男子，受到火上加汕的　迫者，便是時裝。</p>
<p>太史公曰：女為悅已者容，現在則變得成爲「男爲容己者苦」了。這裏所指的苦，其童義　有兩頭：一是經濟地增耗，二是看了這種不倫不類的冬季女裝，在心理上感到老大的不舒服也。</p>

<h3>Formal Announcement from the U.S. State Department: Long-Term Aid Plan for China to be Proposed, Amounting to Approximately $570 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 8th (Broadcast): The U.S. State Department has officially announced the new figure of $570 million for loans to aid China. However, the government is still attempting to temporarily delay the loans to China until the European Recovery Program is underway. Several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have expressed opposition to this, with Congressman Walter Judd and many other members advocating for immediate aid to China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Nanjing, 7th: The U.S. State Department announced on the night of the 6th that it would request Congress to approve a $570 million aid plan for China. After the news reached here, officials expressed satisfaction, and at the same time, they believed that since President Zhang Qun made a public statement on the 28th of last month on the Chinese government's views on the U.S. aid to China issue, and presented ten major financial and economic reforms to be implemented, the U.S. government's actions to aid China were significantly more active than before. Although the reports received here by late night were still incomplete, and officials had not received formal reports, and the specific details of the U.S. government's proposal were still unknown, regardless, our current need for foreign aid is a fact, and the assistance extended by American friends due to the long-standing friendship between the two countries is truly appreciated. If this proposal can be supported by the U.S. Congress and passed quickly, coupled with our own well-planned self-help program, this year's situation will be greatly different. Last year, the main goal of the current government was to lay a good foundation before the establishment of the constitutional government. If the ten financial and economic reforms elaborated by President Zhang can be successfully completed soon with the aid of the U.S., financial stability can be gradually achieved, and fiscal balance can be sought, then administrative reform and military reform can be implemented subsequently, or even complement each other and lead to success together.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The U.S. State Department officially announced on the evening of the 6th that the State Department may request Congress to approve an aid plan for China amounting to $570 million. This amount is $270 million more than the initial estimate of aid to China made by Marshall four months ago, and cannot be regarded as a formal request approved by President Truman. On the evening of the 6th, the State Department, at the request of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, informed the committee that the government would request a total of $9.333 billion in foreign aid appropriations (including the portion for aid to China) for the initial fifteen months, starting from April 1st. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas (who is assisting the Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Aid Programs) sent a letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, listing the amount of aid to each country as follows: The first category, included in the budget appropriations proposed by the President, is: $6.8 billion for the European Recovery Program, $1.4 billion for the administration and relief of occupied areas, and $133.3 million for the Philippines' war damage recovery and veterans' benefits, the last item has been approved by Congress. The second category includes aid to China and other foreign aid appropriations, with a total amount of $1 billion, of which $750 million is included in the budget appropriations proposed by the President, and the remaining $250 million is what the President will soon request Congress to approve. The second category includes aid to China, military assistance to Greece and Turkey, aid for the recovery of Japan and South Korea proposed by the Department of the Army, Pan-American military cooperation, and aid to Trieste, the latter four totaling less than $500 million. Douglas said that significant progress has been made in the aid plan for China, and he can point out that Congress may be requested to approve $570 million for China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The aid plan for China outlined by U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas on behalf of the various departments of the government in his letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is the "engine" of a long-term aid and reconstruction plan for China. Douglas estimated that the cost of the aid plan for China may be $570 million, but he also stated that this figure does not represent a formal request that has been approved by President Truman. Of the $570 million, $470 million will be used to purchase food, cotton, gasoline, and other raw materials, and the remaining $100 million will be used to purchase machinery to improve Chinese factories.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The Republican Four-Member Committee plans to meet with Vandenberg on the 8th to discuss changes to the European Recovery Program. Vandenberg hopes to submit the foreign aid bill to the Senate on March 1st.</p>
<h3>Bei Zuyi Negotiating in the U.S.: Loan for Our Currency Reform; Lou Tongsun Says the New Currency Will be on the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, told United Press on the 7th that Bei Zuyi is negotiating with the U.S. government for a loan of between $300 million and $500 million to serve as the specie reserve for China's new currency system. This loan is unrelated to the rumored $500 million in U.S. aid. The U.S. aid will be used to stabilize the economic situation and lay the foundation for currency reform, and it is expected to be of great use. The $500 million loan can not only promote economic stability, but also has great value for anti-communist military efforts. Negotiating the loan is part of Bei Zuyi's mission. Bei has also brought several currency reform plans that can be submitted to the U.S. government for consideration. The new currency system under consideration is roughly based on the gold standard, with silver coins as subsidiary currency. Some parties in the United States advocate that the currency should be based purely on silver, but this cannot be implemented in China.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Five Legislative Yuan Committees: Reviewing the National General Budget; Decided to Form a 19-Member Subcommittee for Detailed Study</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Nanjing, 7th: The Legislative Yuan's Legal System, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, and Military Affairs Committees held a joint meeting at 10 a.m. on the 7th to review the national general budget proposal, chaired by Liu Kejun. During the meeting, there were approximately two opinions on the Executive Yuan's proposed general budget for the first half of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948]: One opinion was that the various items of revenue and expenditure listed in the proposal were too vague and unclear, and failed to reflect government policies. It was advocated that the heads of various ministries and commissions be invited to attend the review meeting to re-discuss and clarify the proposal. The other opinion was that the current government is in a transitional period, and the government's implementation of the constitution is imminent, making it difficult to re-formulate policy guidelines. President Zhang explained this point at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 5th, and pointed out that the government is still making every effort to pay attention to finance, economy, and finance in order to obtain a stable currency value foundation, which is actually one of the important policies, and it seems that it can be largely agreed upon. Finally, it was decided to form a 19-member subcommittee (each of the 11 Legislative Yuan committees will recommend one person, in addition to the heads of the 5 standing committees, plus 3 members of the Finance Committee, totaling 19 people), convened by Li Yun, and the heads of various ministries and commissions will be invited to participate separately for detailed study. As for the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting originally scheduled for the 12th, it was decided to postpone it because the review of various proposals still requires time.</p>
<h3>Provincial and Municipal Budgets for This Year: Still to be Drafted According to the Original Method</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] It is learned that the Executive Yuan originally ordered the provincial and municipal governments to draft and submit for approval the drafting of the general budget for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] and the verification of central subsidies after the "Provisional Adjustment Measures for Local Financial Revenue and Expenditure in the 37th Year" are approved and implemented. It is now heard that the above-mentioned measures require time to complete the legislative process due to changes in the revenue and expenditure system. The first half-year budgets of the provincial and municipal governments urgently need to complete the review and approval process, and time is pressing. Therefore, the provincial governments are still ordered to handle matters in accordance with the provisions of the "Measures for Drafting and Reviewing the General Budget of Provincial and Municipal Governments in the 37th Year" and the "Provisional Measures for Drafting the General Budget of the Central and Provincial/Municipal Governments in the 37th Year."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Nanjing, 7th: Due to exporters' lack of understanding of trade conditions and import requirements in the United States and Hawaii, there have recently been instances of goods being shipped to ports and then denied entry.

This loan is of a forward-ordering nature, and will be repaid with salt in the future. Shen Xirui is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai on the 8th.</p>

<h3>China Still Considering Whether to Participate in the International New Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The new tariff rates discussed at the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference and the tariff reduction consultation conference have been implemented since January this year. More than ten countries, including the UK, USA, France, Canada, Netherlands, and Belgium, have participated. China is still considering the matter. According to sources, China will remain in a wait-and-see attitude until the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference concludes its third session, the United Nations Trade Charter has not been formulated, and an international commercial organization has not been established. No decision will be made on participating in the international new tariff agreement. It is understood that China's current considerations can be divided into two aspects. From a favorable perspective, participating in the international agreement's new tariff rates can reduce the cost of exported goods and encourage exports, and it can demonstrate cooperation with countries that advocate the implementation of new tariffs. There are also two unfavorable aspects: foreign goods imported into China can also enjoy lower tax rates, and under the current restrictions on imports, customs revenue will be reduced.</p>
<h3>United Nations Press Conference to Be Held in Geneva; China Designates Ten Representatives to Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information is scheduled to be held in Geneva on March 23rd.

Therefore, there should be a plan for foreign exchange, and it is possible to transfer locally stationed personnel. For example, Zhang Pengchun, the representative of China who originally participated in the small group meeting of the Conference on Freedom of Information, may still serve as a representative. As for the rumors that Deng Youde and others have been decided to participate, it is currently undecided. Deng specifically stated tonight that this matter has not yet been decided, and this news is inaccurate. The conference period will last for more than a month.</p>
<h3>Philippines Expels Overseas Chinese Vendors; Chen Zhiping Protests Strongly; Yesterday Presented a Note to the Philippine Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 7th] Our ambassador to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, returned to Manila yesterday after a month of vacation. Today, before the Philippine authorities made a decision on the issue of overseas Chinese vendors in the Philippine Supreme Court, he presented a note to the Philippine Foreign Ministry to express his protest. The note was worded strongly, stating in essence that the Philippine Foreign Ministry should assist the overseas Chinese vendors who are being banned to resume business, or assist the vendors to obtain a written guarantee from the Philippine government allowing them to establish their own markets. The note also pointed out that the issuance of the ban seemed to regard overseas Chinese as the only foreign merchants operating in Philippine markets. It also said that this measure by the Philippine authorities not only violated the spirit of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship, but also caused unnecessary tensions in the friendly and pleasant relations that have existed between China and the Philippines. At the same time, representatives of the overseas Chinese vendors who have been banned visited Ambassador Chen this morning and asked him to strive for a completely satisfactory solution to this issue.</p>

<h3>How to Balance the National Budget?</h3>
<p>At a time when currency values are falling and prices are rising, simply studying the budget in terms of figures has very limited significance. Therefore, although the national general budget for the first half of this year has been officially announced, it has not been able to attract widespread public attention. At the same time, during the Legislative Yuan's review, everyone abandoned these figures and instead focused on general fiscal policies for concentrated discussion. This is an inevitable result.</p>
<p>For example, both ordinary revenue and expenditure are listed as more than 26 trillion yuan. The revenue portion, totaling fifteen items, is said to be all regular income and fairly reliable. However, according to last year's price index, the inflation rate has reached fourteen times. Under this malignant inflation, price increases will inevitably accelerate month by month, and the valuation of various commodity taxes, despite being adjusted monthly to keep up, will ultimately not keep pace with the rate of price increases. Moreover, many items, such as the surplus of state-owned enterprises, fines and compensations, donations and gifts, etc., may not be adjusted periodically according to ad valorem taxes. Therefore, this portion of revenue and expenditure may not be fully offset, as estimated by the authorities. As for the special revenue item, the listed loan is 800 billion yuan. Considering the performance of last year's US dollar bonds, how much of it can actually be realized is even more questionable.</p>
<p>If expenditures increase unexpectedly due to price increases, and revenues decrease significantly due to uncertainty, the natural result will inevitably be to increase issuance to make up for the deficit. The result of increased issuance will inevitably stimulate prices, thereby increasing expenditures and creating a larger deficit. If this cycle continues, with each being both cause and effect, the extent of the gap in the final accounts in the future is really impossible to predict and truly frightening.</p>
<p>At a time when the Communists are causing disturbances and military affairs are pressing, if the above-mentioned gap is to be filled by reducing expenditures according to the usual methods, it is probably an impossible task. Therefore, the only remedy, apart from increasing issuance, is to increase revenue again and balance the budget. There is no other way. As for the US aid item, the figure has been announced as US$570 million up to recently, which is indeed larger than the previously rumored US$300 million. However, the details of its contents have not yet been reported in detail as of this writing. Whether a portion can be transferred in the future to make up for the budget deficit, and if so, whether it can be used in the first half of this year, and whether it can be passed by both houses of parliament as proposed, with or without amendments, are all unknown. Therefore, if this gap is to avoid issuing banknotes, we still have to rely on our own efforts to find a solution.</p>
<p>Based on the principle of contributing according to ability, the property donation item was already considered a legitimate measure for extraordinary times during the War of Resistance against Japan. Last year, it was discussed and a plan was formulated, and it seemed to be inevitable. It is expected that the result of the implementation will be considerable, because it is compulsory and completely targeted at fixed households. In addition to its emergency effect on finance, it also embodies the meaning of averaging wealth. Everyone believes that it is fair and just. Unexpectedly, after several delays, it suddenly changed its nature in mid-stream and was changed to a special relief donation. Although it is still a special donation, its nature has changed to a voluntary donation. Its purpose is also limited to relief work and refugee relief. Although the outcome is still difficult to predict now, its effect on making up for the budget deficit and increasing the national treasury is limited, because this item is not listed under the expenditure items. Although the total amount listed by the departments in charge of the Ministry of Social Affairs is 114.1 billion yuan, we believe that the proportion used for relief and refugee relief may not be very large.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the item of abolishing redundant agencies and reducing unnecessary expenditures. This was already included in the emergency economic measures announced on February 17th last year. Now, looking at the budget table, it is of course impossible to see whether this measure is included. However, judging from the recent announcements of the authorities, there is no sign of drastic action to implement this matter. In addition, in the special revenue part, the proceeds from the sale of state-owned property and materials are listed as 165 billion yuan, accounting for 3.68% of this revenue, while in the ordinary revenue part, 126.7 billion yuan is also listed, accounting for 0.476% of this revenue. The total of the two items is not very small. However, for various reasons, the sale of all state-owned enterprises seems to be subject to imperial restrictions and has not been carried out to this day. It is difficult to believe that it will be actively carried out in the future. Moreover, the enemy and puppet industries and materials that were easy to sell have already been sold out. It is especially uncertain how much of the remaining ones can still be sold in the next six months. As for the income from state-owned enterprises, only 600 million yuan is listed in the ordinary part and 4548.3 billion yuan is listed in the special part. Even if these figures are very reliable, they seem to be less than what people generally expect.</p>
<p>The general public has indeed suffered enough from inflation and the depreciation of the legal currency. In the private sector, production is shrinking and life is difficult, revealing a picture of not being able to survive. In the government, resources are stretched and things are difficult, reaching the point of exhaustion. Now that the fact of fictitious revenue and real expenditure and a huge deficit is clearly in front of us, in order to maintain the status quo and avoid deepening the deterioration of finances and the economy, we must make every effort to find ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in order to strive for a balanced budget. Although it is a common knowledge that there are no resources to exploit and no magic to turn things into gold, financial difficulties and economic peril are not unique to our country. Looking at countries such as Britain and France, the huge number of deficits and the desolation of the national economy are alarming and put them in extremely difficult situations. The difference is that they have overall methods and courage. In addition to large-scale government cuts, they are willing to endure temporary and extreme pain in currency system, prices, foreign exchange, production, consumption, and international trade in order to fight against the harsh environment. However, our country is perfunctory and covers up the problem, and has never come up with a complete set of solutions. With a solution, such as using foreign deposits, absorbing overseas remittances, levying property donations, etc., we are still timid and have too many considerations, and cannot use thorough means. Continuing to muddle along without a plan, relying solely on increasing banknote issuance to get by, and relying on some piecemeal measures to deal with the current situation will probably not only make everyone feel helpless about the budget, but also make the future of the entire national economy extremely bleak.</p>
<p>However, things must be said from two sides. The government has its responsibilities, and the people also have their responsibilities. At this time of great difficulty and imminent disaster, if the people are still living in a drunken dream and are not aware of the situation, but are only living by speculating, hoarding, evading taxes, and evading capital, and are only seeking to evade and circumvent all laws and regulations, colluding and engaging in corruption, and are unwilling to abide by the law and cooperate sincerely with the government, then even if there are good laws and intentions and solutions to save the times, I am afraid they will be ineffective. Everyone is very clear that the embezzlement and corruption of all tax revenues, the manipulation from top to bottom, and even tax evasion and smuggling are definitely not the responsibility of the tax officials alone. The deterioration and distortion of all economic controls, the fact that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and even the complete failure in the end are definitely not the responsibility of the government alone. It must be known that with the spread of the Red Disaster and the devastation of the people, will there be complete eggs under an overturned nest? On the contrary, the higher the taxpaying ability, the more severe the suffering and destruction will be. And the wealthier the family is, the more luxurious the enjoyment is, and the more illegal profits are earned, the clearer the target will be and the more impossible it will be to escape. Therefore, everyone should not evade the obligation of the people to pay taxes, but should shoulder it together. Increasing the revenue of the national treasury by one point will reduce the danger to oneself by one point. In particular, the wealthy merchants, rich gentry, and all those who have made a fortune from national disasters and speculation should set an example and do their best to contribute to special relief donations, national donations, and all legitimate taxes in order to alleviate the country's urgent difficulties and appease the public's resentment. This is the only way to balance the budget. The way to avoid increasing issuance lies here. And the way to stabilize prices, restore people's livelihoods, and improve all public and private economies also lies here.</p>
<h3>Tibetan Trade Delegation Pays Respects to the Chairman and Presents Local Products</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Xia Guba and the other four members of the Tibetan Trade Investigation Delegation paid their respects to Chairman Chiang at 11:00 a.m. on the 7th, accompanied by Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission.

<h3>Representatives of Various Ethnic Groups in Eastern Xinjiang Scheduled to Pay Respects to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Yao Le, Ph.D., and the other representatives of various ethnic groups in Eastern Xinjiang have recently registered with the National Government and are scheduled to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. In addition to presenting a flag, they also brought valuable local products such as Hami melons, deer antlers, and raisins.

<h3>Matters to Note for Exporting National Products to the United States</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) All products containing salicylic acid or coumarin, such as dried plums, are absolutely prohibited. Products containing rotten or unclean substances cannot be exported. The wording of advertisements in newspapers should be simple and clear. If Chinese is used, it should be translated into English, and the two should be consistent, without additions or deletions. All untruthful or exaggerated and deceptive advertisements must be deleted. When a product is made of multiple materials, one major raw material must be selected for naming. For example, if the oyster sauce from a certain company contains more soy than oysters, then naming it oyster sauce is not accurate. Similarly, for the flower fish and fried dace of a certain company, the English translation is generally referred to as "fried fish," which is too broad. It should be directly translated as "flower fish or dace." The rest can be inferred by analogy. In short, the naming must be accurate. The weight must be accurate. Weight is divided into two types: liquid and solid. Liquid, such as water and oil, is calculated in pints, quarts, and gallons. Solid is calculated in pounds. The poundage stated on the label must be accurate. When a product is made of multiple materials, not only the name of the main material should be written, but also the other materials should be written separately, in order of quantity. The name and address of the manufacturer or packer must be clearly stated on the label. The source of the product must be clearly stated on the label, such as "Made in China" or "Made in Hong Kong." Canned food made in China often uses old cans. The method of making it is to put the food in the can first, leaving a small hole in the lid. After steaming to vent, the hole is sealed with tin. These types of canned food have not undergone sterilization methods, and there is often a feeling of bulging air inside. The United States believes that there are corrupt materials inside and often does not welcome them. As for new cans, the packaging should be made with machines and new scientific methods to suit the American health practices. Medicines are divided into two types: new and old. All raw medicines that were imported before 1938 are considered old medicines. If handling loose medicinal materials, they must be clean and free from insects. For newly invented medicines, a detailed explanation of the various substances contained and how to use them must be provided. If you want to sell these newly invented medicines in the United States, you must register in the United States in advance. When they arrive in the United States, they must be inspected and stamped by the Drug Administration before they can be sold. If the label of a medicine states that it can cure a certain disease, the medicine must indeed have the effect of curing that disease.</p>

<h3>Communist Party of China's Destruction of Catholicism is Directed by Moscow</h3>
<p>In Remarks by a Bishop's Spokesperson</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] According to reports from Catholic missionaries who have personally experienced the situation after returning from our country, the Chinese Communist Party is about to destroy Catholic churches in China. A spokesperson for the National Catholic Welfare Conference stated to reporters today: "The Chinese Communist Party is well aware that Catholicism is the single greatest bulwark against the greatest evil in the world today," 9= (Note: this greatest evil is Communism). The spokesperson, who had been preaching in the Central and North China regions for seven years, stated frankly: "From all the impressions and documents he has seen, it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party's policy of eradicating Catholic churches in North China is absolutely directed by Moscow."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th, United Press] The grandfather of Father An Lianshan, editor of the American Catholic Jesuit magazine, met with reporters today and accused the CCP of currently killing American missionaries in areas of North China captured by the Communists.

<h3>Aftermath of the Dayong Massacre Troublesome for Hunan Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Investigating Officials Hesitate to Advance</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 7th] According to individuals from Dayong who have come to Changsha, after the newly appointed County Magistrate Huang Yingchuan and Secretary Cheng Mianzhi were killed on the 28th, order in Dayong was extremely chaotic for a time, and residents were plunged into terror. Gunfire was still heard on the 29th. The forensic examination by the Judicial Office did not begin until the afternoon of that day. Huang had a gunshot wound to the head. His leather shoes, top hat, and the legal tender he had on his person were all gone, leaving only a single layer of clothing. Cheng had a gunshot wound to the chest, his eyes wide open, covered in mud and blood, his state was extremely tragic. After the examination of the bodies was completed, the county government prepared thin coffins for temporary burial. The county police and self-defense forces rushed to build fortifications in the city, as if facing a formidable enemy. Rumors are spreading that if the provincial government exerts too much pressure, they will not hesitate to riot to resist. There are too many guns among the people in the county; almost every able-bodied man has one. They are already extremely terrified of being treated the same way as the county magistrate, and if the provincial government acts too aggressively, it may force them to take risks, gather a crowd, and rebel. The three officials dispatched to Dayong to thoroughly investigate are hesitant to advance, and the provincial government feels extremely troubled by this, with no plan for the aftermath. There are differing opinions in Changsha; the Hunan Daily advocates that the case be strictly handled together with the May Seventh Massacre of last year, which would be fair. The Zhongxing Daily attacks the former county magistrate, advocating strict handling of the murderers of Huang and the people behind them. The Central Daily News advocates resolving the dispute first, and then arresting the murderers.</p>

<h3>Arab League Considers Britain Concluding a Middle East Defense Agreement The Entire Issue of Libya's Independence is Raised Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] The Council of the seven-nation Arab League is holding a ten-day meeting here today, and relations between Britain and Arab countries will be one of the topics of discussion. The Council will also consider signing a Middle East regional defense agreement between the Arab League and Britain, so that Arab countries do not have to sign agreements with Britain individually. It is generally expected that the League Council will try to formulate a positive policy towards Britain for the following reasons: ! The increasingly deteriorating relationship between the Eastern and Western blocs in Europe; the spread of Communism in the Middle East; developments after Iraq's rejection of the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty. However, political figures also believe that opinions within the Arab world are not yet consistent, so there is still doubt as to whether the Arab League can sign a regional defense agreement with Britain. If this proposal cannot be implemented, the Council may consider changing the League's charter to require member states to obtain the League's approval before negotiating with any major power. In addition, the Arab League will also consider the four major political issues of the Palestinian situation: the League's attitude after the arrival of the United Nations Palestine Committee in the Holy Land; the policy towards the Security Council's possible dispatch of international troops to the Holy Land; the future of the Palestinian Arab government; the status of Jews in various Arab countries. Other issues to be considered include the establishment of an air force base by the United States in Tripoli, the future of Libya, and the economic disputes between Syria and Lebanon after Syria's departure from the French Group.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] It is reported that Arab countries have individually submitted identical notes to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, demanding that the whole of Libya (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica) be made independent and opposing the establishment of trusteeship in the area.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Western European Alliance Still Has Many Obstacles Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg Hope to Link Up with the Pan-American Convention</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Foreign observers say that the increasing fear of the Soviet Union in European countries may prevent the Bevin Western European Alliance plan from being aborted. Although the British side has repeatedly emphasized that the Bevin plan is not aimed at the Soviet Union, the Nordic countries seem to have accepted Moscow's view that the Western European Alliance is aimed at the Soviet Union and is a step towards war. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg seem to only allow participation on the condition that they have equal voting rights with Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sweden, 6th] Swedish Foreign Minister Unden declared today that Sweden is prepared to join the Western European Alliance, but only if the plan is based on the Marshall Plan, which Sweden can support, making cooperation in Western Europe its ten key objectives.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Reliable sources say that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are taking a very reserved attitude towards the proposal by Britain and France to conclude a five-nation alliance in the manner of the Anglo-French alliance agreed upon in Dunkirk. The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have informally stated that they are not very willing to join any agreement aimed solely at Germany and have expressed the hope to expand any such alliance to establish a link with the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance signed in Rio de Janeiro on September 3, 1947. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg believe that the idea of uniting Western Europe politically and economically must include West Germany, so concluding a defense treaty aimed at Germany is not sufficient to help the goal of the Western European Alliance and will be detrimental to it. As for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg's advocacy of establishing a link with the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, it is because the three countries believe that any Western European organization will ultimately need the military assistance of the United States.</p>
<p>France Willing to Participate in Customs Union</p>
<p>French diplomatic figures here say that France has always supported allowing Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to participate in all discussions about Germany. Well-informed sources believe that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg will definitely be invited to participate in the Anglo-American-French three-nation meeting to be held in London on February 10. At the same time, France is currently discussing the possibility of establishing a customs union with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. France has submitted a draft agreement on the Franco-Italian customs union to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. It is said that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have expressed great interest in this, but feel that its realization is still fraught with difficulties.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Bevin Reaffirms Assurance</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech at the New Zealand Commemoration Dinner tonight, assuring that the British Commonwealth countries will support the proposal to organize a Western European Alliance. He said, "Western European countries have split into several small groups, and the concept of Western European countries is becoming narrower. We have now put forward a broader and more courageous policy. As we put forward this policy and develop this policy, Western European countries can know that the entire British Commonwealth will support this great effort aimed at promoting peace and security in the Old Continent."</p>
<h3>Cripps Says the Pound Will Not Be Devalued U.S. Loan Only Enough for One Month's Use</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Edinburgh, 7th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps said today in an address to the Scottish Savings Committee meeting that the government currently has no intention of devaluing the pound. [Reuters, Washington, 6th] Britain continued to draw 100 million dollars from the United States loan today. Now, out of the total of 3.75 billion dollars loaned to Britain by the United States, only 100 million dollars remain. It is expected that the last 100 million dollars will be withdrawn at the beginning of next month, at which time the loan to Britain by the United States will be completely used up, which is eighteen months after the approval of the Anglo-American loan agreement, and at least one month before the implementation of the Marshall Plan. Financial experts here expect that if the Marshall Plan is not implemented by April 1 of this year, Britain will have to step up the sale of its gold reserves starting in early April.</p>

<h3>Bulgaria Encourages Jewish Immigration Britain Protests Strongly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Britain lodged its strongest protest with the Bulgarian government last Saturday over the continuous flow of illegal Jewish immigrants from Bulgarian Black Sea ports to Palestine. This was not announced until tonight. The British note pointed out that Britain had repeatedly warned Bulgaria about illegal Jewish immigrants leaving Bulgaria for Palestine, and added that the illegal Jewish immigrant ships "Fan York" and "Fan Classon" recently seized by the British Navy had set sail from the Bulgarian port of Burgas. The note pointed out that United Nations agencies have repeatedly appealed to countries to avoid any action that could further exacerbate the situation in Palestine at this critical juncture when Jewish-Arab relations are about to be strained. The note states that the British government believes that if Bulgaria has the sincerity to join the United Nations, it should familiarize itself with the activities of the United Nations agencies and the obligations that member states of the United Nations should fulfill. The note concludes by stating that the British government has concluded that the Bulgarian government is either deliberately encouraging illegal Jewish immigrants to leave Bulgaria for Palestine, or Bulgarian officials have committed serious mistakes.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 6th] The Arab Higher Committee today formally notified United Nations Secretary-General Lie, on behalf of the Palestinian Arabs, that the United Nations' attempt to partition Palestine will be regarded as an act of aggression.

<h3>West Germany Establishes Federal Bank; British, American and French Negotiations Underway; Charter Is Not a Constitution, Only a Temporary Measure</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] The new economic administration decree for the Anglo-American merged zone in West Germany, which was announced on the 6th, has granted the Germans in the merged zone broad authority to decide economic matters. The charter for the establishment of the West German Federal Bank, which has been postponed because the negotiations among Britain, the United States, and France have not yet concluded, is expected to be finalized with the support of the three powers.</p>

British and American officials also stated that this charter should not be formally named a constitution, as it only stipulates economic matters. One official also pointed out that the most important "byproduct" of this reform is the Germans' heated discussion of whether this new reform has stipulated too much or too little centralism, which shows the awakening of democratic consciousness in West Germany.</p>

<h3>Katayama Cabinet Shaken; Parties Compete for Power; Liberal Party and Democratic Party Both Plan to Form New Government</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] The impending political turmoil in Japan may not have any new developments, but the political parties are actively negotiating and moving behind the scenes. The Democratic Party, led by Foreign Minister Ashida, has always acted as an arbiter in the past, and now it will obviously still play the role of mediator. Ashida revealed a plan yesterday to exclude the extreme right and extreme left and gather the political forces of the centrists. This is quite surprising. It is heard that Shigeru Yoshida, the president of the right-wing Liberal Party, had a similar plan as early as two months ago, and has already won the support of some defectors from the Democratic Party. As for the Socialist Party, it seems that it would rather see the cabinet collapse than have a fatal split within the party. Under the current circumstances, if the current cabinet collapses one day, Katayama will probably have no successor. The chaos of the Japanese political party situation is unparalleled.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani declared after today's cabinet meeting that the Katayama cabinet will not collapse this weekend. Katayama now advocates transferring the government to the Liberal Party, the second largest party in the Diet, while the Democratic Party is busy recruiting party members in order to succeed the Socialist Party in forming a new government. Therefore, the crisis of the Japanese cabinet is no longer due to the issue of supplementary budget, but in fact due to the self-division of the government parties.</p>
<h3>Hull's Memoirs; Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance; Compiled by This Newspaper's Editorial Office</h3>
<p>In early February 1940, the President said to me in the White House that he wanted to send Welles on a trip to the important capitals of Europe to see if there was any hope for peace. He asked me if I disapproved of this approach.</p>
<p>(Later, the President made it clear to me that Welles had secretly come to him several times, begging him to be allowed to go abroad on a special mission. Originally, Welles had asked the President to send him out in 1940. The President was only asking me if I objected to Welles' mission. For this reason, I felt quite satisfied.)</p>
<p>I immediately replied that if he really wanted to send Welles on a trip, I did not object. However, I said, I want to make a few points.</p>
<p>I reiterated a point of view that I had said to the President several times in recent weeks. I said, "The moment of war is almost upon us. The three Axis countries have established unprecedented military armaments. Hitler, Mussolini, and the spokesmen of Japan have shamelessly stated that they are determined to engage in limited conquest. They are firmly and unmistakably moving in this direction, straight as a bullet. This situation has occurred from 1933 to this year, after doing everything possible to promote peace within the limits of opposition from isolationists."</p>
<p>I continued, under these circumstances, the world is already on fire, and the Axis countries are ready and almost leaping forward with all their military forces. To talk about peace and visit the belligerent countries will inevitably cause false hopes. This false hope is particularly dangerous for countries and peoples who should be striving to prepare for self-defense; they should not be complacent about imagined geographical security or neutrality.</p>
<p>Continuing to play the tune of promptly achieving peace, the terrible effect of making a country's people linger in a false sense of security can be clearly illustrated by the popular song sung by British soldiers at the time, "We will hang our washing on the Siegfried Line." But I did feel that some terrible omen was brewing.</p>
<p>I also said that five hundred different rumors would inevitably arise about the purpose and results of Welles' trip. These rumors will cause confusion in Europe and at home.</p>
<p>In this stage of the war, I personally would not consider sending Welsh or anyone with a similar official status to Europe to assume such a task. Welles believed that even if the "Phony War" continued, it would still be impossible to find some basis for peace. But Hitler was obviously frantically preparing to end the "Phony War" in his only way, which is all-out intense combat, and the only way to stop him from preparing in this way is to give him everything he asks for. But this is equivalent to Nazi control of Europe, and another war will happen within a few years.</p>
<p>On February 9, the President himself announced Welles' mission, saying that at the President's request, Welles would visit Italy, France, Germany, and Britain, with the sole purpose of providing the President and me with opinions on the current situation in Europe. However, the President had the meaning I had proposed in mind, so he emphasized that Welles had no power to make suggestions or decisions on behalf of the US government. Any statements made to him by officials of other governments must be kept strictly confidential and can only be conveyed to him and me by Welles.</p>
<p>On the same day, I announced that we had begun informal negotiations with other neutral governments. I explained that these negotiations were a preliminary exploration of a sound international economic system and universal disarmament in the world. The current war situation is not involved, but belligerent countries can also be included, because these dialogues involve two common issues for the future peace.</p>
<p>At that time, we had launched a plan to formulate the form of a postwar world as much as possible, in order to propose it to other countries and our own people. These talks are a part of this exploration and research work.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the announcement of Welles' mission caused many rumors. Although the President emphasized that the delegation should not make any decisions, many isolationists took this opportunity to cause an uproar, claiming that we were about to be drawn into European disputes. Others were equally convinced that Welles must have a definite mission, which is to achieve peace in Europe at any cost by the Allied countries or ourselves. Still others speculated that there were differences of opinion between the President and me, and between Welles and me. In order to quell these rumors, I issued a statement on February 14, saying:</p>
<p>"I think the President and I are almost as consistent in our foreign policy and methods as any two people holding the same positions. After our discussions and meetings, first the President announced the special delegation to Europe, and then I myself announced the issues related to postwar economic recovery and disarmament. There was nothing abnormal happening at the time."</p>
<p>Afterwards, I expressed my compliments to Welles, expressing my appreciation.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Jay Pierrepont Moffat, the director of the European Division of the State Department, Welles visited Rome, Berlin, Paris, and London. He saw the leaders of every government and Pope Pius XII, and talked to them in detail. He gave them a memorandum on our economic policy centered on the trade agreement plan, which we hope to adopt after the war. He received from them lengthy opinions on the war, defending themselves in every way.</p>
<p>Although he kept his promise to the President, that is, to keep everything he was told strictly confidential, rumors always followed and were rife. These rumors filled the Allied countries and small neutral countries with terror, fearing that the President would take peace action after Welles returned, and this action would inevitably recognize most of Hitler's gains and make another war unavoidable. As a result, the President and I agreed that he would give a speech to try to dispel this fear. Therefore, Mr. Roosevelt delivered a speech from the White House to the Conference of Foreign Workers of Christian Churches on March 16:</p>
<p>"Today, we are looking for a moral basis for peace. If brotherly love cannot be understood, there can be no true peace. If the result of peace is oppression, or hunger, or cruelty, or human life is controlled by armed camps, there can be no lasting peace. If small countries must live in fear of strong powers, there can be no sound peace. If the freedom from aggression is sold out as a sacrifice, there can be no moral peace. If the free exchange of ideas is denied, making it impossible for human beings to reach a common position, there can be no rational peace. If the right to worship God is denied, there is no righteous peace."</p>
<p>To further eliminate these dangerous rumors, I sent a memorandum to the President on March 18, with a draft telegram that I intended to send to Welles, who was in Rome at the time, "urging him to be particularly cautious." The President wrote "OKFDR" on the memorandum in pencil. On the same day, I sent a telegram to Welles, saying that I had made it clear to the press that his mission was purely of a fact-finding nature, that he could not assume the role of mediator between one belligerent country and another, or participate in any negotiations, and that he could not imagine that he could express opinions or take action on any peace proposals based on the threat of force or any ultimatum with a time limit. I believed that he could not receive any peace terms other than providing us with information. Before leaving Rome, Welles issued a statement to the press, stating that he had not received or transmitted any peace proposals and that his mission was only to collect information.</p>
<p>On March 20, British Ambassador Lothian came to see me and expressed his gratitude to the President and me for what he considered to be timely action to prevent and dispel the spread of the sentiment of "seeking peace at any cost." According to him, this sentiment stemmed from various rumors about Welles possibly creating a peace negotiated in Europe, and such a peace would be tantamount to a German victory. He said that any effort to achieve peace through negotiations might undermine the war efforts of Britain and France. I made it clear that in recent weeks we had never neglected the most minute aspects of the entire issue and were prepared to express our position clearly at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>When Welles returned to Washington at the end of March, he presented a very complete report to the President and me on his conversations with Mussolini, Hitler, Daladier, Chamberlain, the Pope, and their foreign ministers. Probably no one could have gleaned more information from them, but the information he obtained did not give us any basis for action. The leaders he had spoken with did not give him any hope of peace. The President issued a statement on March 29, stating that while there was little prospect of any fair peace at present, the information collected by Welles was undoubtedly of the greatest value and would be useful when the opportunity to establish peace arrived in the future. But based on the proof of later facts, even this statement was too optimistic. The opportunity for peace did not come for more than five years, and when it came, the figures who led the British, German, and Italian governments in 1940 had died, and the head of the French government at that time was no longer in office.</p>

<h3>Preventing a Surge in Commodity Prices; Important Decisions by the Economic Conference; Rice, Oil, Coal, and Sugar are All Not in Short Supply</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The fourth economic conference of Shanghai Municipality was held at 3 pm yesterday in the City Government Conference Room. Representatives from the Central Bank, Financial Management Bureau, Supervisory Envoy's Office, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, Fuel Management Committee, Police Bureau, Garrison Headquarters, Municipal Government, Social Affairs Bureau, and Municipal Chamber of Commerce, totaling more than ten people, attended. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting. The resolutions are as follows: Rice issue: Recently, due to weather conditions and the approach of the end of the lunar year, fewer goods have arrived, and rice prices have fluctuated. The municipal government has decided to release a large amount of rice after the opening of the market after the Lunar New Year, releasing an average of more than 10,000 dan of rice to the market every day for ten to fifteen days. The price at which the rice will be sold is currently being discussed with the Ministry of Food. Edible oil issue: After the fifth day of the first lunar month, edible oil will be fully rationed to households, and 4 million catties of edible oil have been prepared. Coal briquettes: Workers' coal briquettes can be rationed after the fifth day of the first lunar month. Household sugar can also be rationed during the Lunar New Year. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently discussing this with the Resources Committee. Coal source issue: Recently, coal has been arriving continuously from Xingang, and there are also transportation plans for coal in February. The supply of coal this month should not cause panic. In addition, regarding the situation of gold notes in the past two months, Liu Gongshu and Li Lixia have successively made detailed reports. The following issues were then discussed:</p>
<h3>Measures to Crack Down on Paper Hoarding and Profiteering Passed</h3>
<p>1.  The measures to crack down on paper hoarding and profiteering are as follows: A. The types of paper for which hoarding and profiteering should be cracked down are defined as newsprint and rough-edged paper (including both local paper and machine-made paper) in this city. B. Regarding the amount of storage, it is stipulated that non-commercial individuals or merchants not engaged in the industry, except for those who directly consume the paper, such as associations, magazines, and printing houses, shall not purchase and store newsprint and rough-edged paper unless necessary. The storage quantity of direct consumers shall be reported to the same industry association for submission to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification at any time. Merchants engaged in the industry may purchase and store a quantity of newsprint and rough-edged paper up to one-quarter of their total sales volume in 1947; otherwise, it shall be treated as hoarding. Newsprint purchased with self-provided foreign exchange shall not be restricted, but it shall be reported to the same industry association for submission to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, and then sold on the market. Those who act as agents to introduce sales and purchases and store paper in disguised names without a genuine owner of the goods shall be treated as hoarding regardless of the amount of goods hoarded once discovered. C. The price of sales on the market: For paper that should be sold within the limit or sold on the market, a negotiated price system shall be adopted. The Shanghai Paper Business Association shall organize a valuation team to negotiate prices at any time, submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and public announcement, and then implement them. If transactions exceed the negotiated price, penalties shall be imposed according to the provisions of Article 18 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times and the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices, depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>2. The police bureau, based on a tip, discovered that Huang Yisheng's wood shop in Pudong had hoarded 60 shi of rice, which has been sealed up. It was also resolved that the rice should be sealed up and the case should be transferred to the court for handling.</p>
<p>3. The police bureau reported that No. 100 Kunming Road was suspected of hoarding paper and submitted a report on the investigation to the meeting for instructions. It was resolved that the paper should be returned.</p>

<h3>Financial Bureau Advocates Lenient Handling of Confiscated Silver</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of whether privately held silver confiscated by the National Bank can be returned, this reporter inquired with Director Li Lixia, who stated: "The official correspondence from the Ministry of Finance to the Financial Management Bureau does not instruct for immediate return, but rather to first investigate whether there was any black market trading activity before determining a course of action. However, the existence of this correspondence implies room for negotiation. Zhou Yizhi, the lawyer hired by the parties involved, has repeatedly consulted with the Bureau, and is currently discussing with the guild in hopes of presenting some compelling evidence to prove that there was no trading activity." Li also expressed his personal opinion, saying: "The parties involved may have engaged in black market gold and currency trading in the past, but today the people are suffering deeply, so I personally advocate for lenient handling."</p>
<h3>Compensation Goods Arriving from Japan to be Unpacked After Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The civilian portion of the Japanese compensation goods that have arrived in the city are currently stored in the No. 7 warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau, under the custody of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office. The office has scheduled a viewing for relevant parties within a week after the Lunar New Year, and an unpacking ceremony will be held on-site. The list of compensation items for private industrial use was scheduled to be delivered to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office here by the Ministry of Economic Affairs last week, but has not yet been received as of this writing. Factories in the city requesting allocation of these goods, mostly large factories, are applying directly to the Ministry, while small factories are unclear about the procedures and are submitting applications through the Guidance Office. According to relevant personnel, three textile machinery companies, based on their scale and history, have a strong chance of being allocated goods. These three companies are the China Textile Machinery Company of Shanghai, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Company, and a certain textile machinery manufacturing plant in Guangxi. In the past, the Ministry originally intended to allocate 500 Japanese compensation textile machines to each company, but although the situation has changed and the original plan cannot be implemented, allocation remains a priority.</p>
<h3>Spring Festival Suppression of Rebellion Propaganda Train Parade Planned</h3>

The main defendant Liu Jixin and others did not appear. As a result of yesterday's interrogation, all ten individuals were suspected of black market gold currency trading and were released on bail by the prosecutor, with further questioning scheduled for a later date.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants' Handling Fee for Allotment of Rationed Rice Set at 5%; Bonus for Absence of Deductions</h3>

<h3>Reporter Association Appeals to Central Government to Ensure at Least One Representative from Shanghai Attends UN Conference on Freedom of the Press</h3>
<p>The United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press will be held in Geneva, Switzerland in mid-March, and various countries will send representatives to participate. It is reported that the conference's organizational rules stipulate that the attendees must be current employees of news organizations. The newly established Reporter Association of this city notes that the selection of Chinese representatives has not yet been decided. It held an extraordinary meeting of the Standing Council on the evening of the 6th, resolving that all Chinese representatives to the conference should be current employees of news organizations, and that at least one representative from this city should participate. The Association decided to send a telegram to the central government and the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, urging them to pay attention to this matter.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing in High-Ranking Executive Yuan Official Embezzlement Case; Director of Investigation Provides Important Testimony: Points Out Many Measures Did Not Conform to Regulations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Criminal Court of the District Court continued to hear the case of high-ranking Executive Yuan officials accused of embezzlement yesterday, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. As a result, each defendant remained on their original bail, and the witnesses were dismissed. After Judge Huang Guangyu took the bench in Criminal Court One, he ordered each defendant to appear in court. Those who reported yesterday included Hou Aichang, Dong Chengdao, Hu Keshi, Jiang Renlin, Pang Yuanlong, Du Cen, and Deng Zhonghe. The defendants Commissioner Huo Yongzhang, Chen Choumin, Lu Jiaju, Section Chief Tao Jingzhen, and contractor Ding Tiansheng did not appear. The witnesses who appeared included Gao Qingxiao, Director of the Investigation Department of the Executive Yuan, Tang Xinghui, General Manager of Qingfeng Yarn Factory, Rong Yixin, Manager of Shenxin No. 3 Factory, Ni Keding, Commissioner of the Executive Yuan, Huang Weiqing, Section Chief, and Zhang Zihui. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of Zhongfang, sent a representative to the court. The main defendant Hou Aichang's testimony mostly consisted of "I don't know" or "I'm not clear." The testimony of Gao Qingxiao, Director of the Investigation Department, is extremely relevant to the future development of the case. A summary of the main points of his testimony is as follows: After the embezzlement case involving high-ranking Executive Yuan officials occurred, the Executive Yuan sent Gao to investigate the inside story. Gao conducted a separate investigation into the welfare embezzlement and electric fan allocation embezzlement, while Gao and Hu Yuyin jointly investigated the cotton-for-yarn embezzlement. Gao then stated seven points: When Jiang Renlin was the Chief of the Welfare Section, he unauthorizedly misappropriated US$500 from the Section's reserve fund. The investigation revealed that this reserve fund was intended to cover the cost of lodging for returning staff from the rear area. The misappropriation to repair houses was highly inappropriate.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Furniture, Unknown Whereabouts</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan staff dormitory in Ruifeng Lane initially contained a large amount of valuable furniture. Subsequently, the furniture disappeared, leaving only broken equipment. The Executive Yuan stipulated that any public funds exceeding 5 million yuan must be approved before being used, and that only registered construction companies were eligible to bid. The repair of the dormitory and the purchase of furniture cost over US$2,000, which was not legally approved, and the contractor Ding Tiansheng, introduced by Commissioner Huo Yongzhang, was not registered and was not a formal businessman, which was illegal. The prices of the furniture purchased exceeded the market prices at the time. According to the regulations of the Audit Office, the purchase of goods must be subject to bidding and comparison, but the purchase of this furniture was not subject to bidding and comparison. The procedures were also incomplete. The dormitory had electrical appliances and refrigerators, but they were not part of the Executive Yuan's furniture.</p>
<p>Electric Fan Allocation, Numbers Do Not Match</p>
<p>Regarding the electric fan allocation issue, according to the Executive Yuan regulations, staff members were not allowed to purchase relief supplies. According to Gao's investigation, Peng Wu荒 had privately stockpiled more than 30 units. He had reported this. After that, as far as he knew, the electric fans had gone through three stages: secret sale, suspension of allocation, and public sale. The announced numbers also did not match the actual numbers. Regarding the cotton-for-yarn exchange ratio, the accounts can be verified, and it can be determined who suffered losses and who profited with a single check. After Gao completed his statement, other witnesses made their statements. At approximately 6:00 PM, the court determined that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Xu Case: Lawyer Xi Bingxi Visits District Court to Review Case Files</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Zhongwei, Chief of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters, accompanied lawyer Xi Bingxi, who is handling the extradition case of Xu Jizhuang, to visit Cha Liangjian, President of the District Court, at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The meeting lasted approximately one hour. It is reported that Hong Kong authorities will bring Xu before the court again on the 18th of this month to determine whether or not to extradite him. Zheng and Xi visited President Cha yesterday to request access to Xu's case files to collect evidence in order to argue their case on the 18th. President Cha expressed his willingness to assist and approved access to Xu's case files. Afterwards, this reporter interviewed Zheng Zhongwei, who stated: the extradition of Xu Jizhuang is being handled in accordance with Article 21 of the 1858 Anglo-Chinese Treaty of Tianjin. Lawyer Xi will return to Hong Kong after collecting the evidence, and will request the Hong Kong authorities to extradite Xu on the 18th so that he can be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Austrian Minister to China, Stonvoul, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Austrian Minister to China, Stonvoul, arrived in Shanghai aboard the Grinnap yesterday morning. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai and several Austrian expatriates in the city greeted him at the dock.</p>
<h3>Flying Tigers Team to Undergo Transformation; China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) Oppose and Protest to Government</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the end of the Civil Air Transport (CAT) team led by Chennault, there are external reports that it will be reorganized into a semi-official civil aviation company under government control. It is understood that China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) are strongly opposed to this and have lodged an unofficial protest to the government. The persons in charge of the two companies are extremely indignant about the various privileges obtained by the Civil Air Transport team under the pretext of transporting relief supplies. For example: China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) have to pay a 50% import tax on the aircraft fuel they purchase, while the Civil Air Transport team is exempt from taxes because it is a relief organization. The Civil Air Transport team obtains far more public exchange at official prices than China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), so it can purchase more flight equipment from abroad and the delivery is very fast because it has priority. However, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) often have to wait for several months before receiving their orders. Hongqiao Airport in this city is an air force airport and has never been allowed for use by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), but the Civil Air Transport team's aircraft can take off and land at the airport. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) have to pay part of their operating income to maintain the Civil Aviation Administration, but the Civil Air Transport team does not have to pay. The Civil Aviation Administration prohibits China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) from flying at night, but it has no right to prohibit the Civil Air Transport team, so the Civil Air Transport team can fly day and night, and the goods and passengers it transports are twice as much as its capacity. Under these circumstances, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) are at a very disadvantageous competitive position, so they are resolutely opposed to the Civil Air Transport team being reorganized into a civil aviation company.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to a source from the Ministry of Transportation, the government has decided to grant the team permission to temporarily exist for one year. After the Executive Yuan has completed the conclusion the matters of its affiliation and the various issues related to air transport that it will handle during this year are currently being planned and requested of higher authorities.</p>
<h3>Anhui Native Place Relief Association First Transfers One Billion to Each of Three Districts to Aid Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Yang Hufang Zhizhi, Chairman of the Anhui Native Place Relief Association in Shanghai, stated that because 59 counties in Anhui Province had suffered from banditry and disaster, and that the displaced victims were in dire straits, that he had joined with Xu Shiying and others from the Anhui Native Place Association in Beijing to form the Anhui Disaster Relief and Reconstruction Committee to raise funds from all sectors of Shanghai. Following solicitations of funds from various parties that have been recognized that achievements have been made, one billion yuan was first transferred to each of the three districts of Anqing, Beng埠, and Wuhu in order to distribute relief to the affected areas. As for refugees in Shanghai, the Association has already disbursed over 400 million yuan for emergency relief. In addition to the 200 million yuan allocated by the Anhui Provincial Government, the remaining shortfall will be paid from the Anhui disaster relief funds.</p>
<h3>A Miracle in Medical History: Infant with Record Number of Digits; Healthy Development, Otherwise No Different</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Le Li, a young mother at the Municipal Second Hospital, gave birth to a boy a week ago. His development is healthy and normal, but he has six fingers on his left hand, seven fingers on his right hand, nine toes on his left foot, and ten toes on his right foot, for a total of 32 digits on his hands and feet. (See picture. Photo by this newspaper.) This sets a record for polydactyly in medical history. After a thorough examination, there were no special abnormalities in the child's various body parts and internal organs, and the pregnancy and delivery were smooth. Dr. Zeng Zhong, the hospital director, and Dr. Li Bingxian, the director of obstetrics and gynecology, are extremely interested in this infant and have already filmed him for medical research. According to the research results of physicians in various departments of the hospital, it is believed that once the child is a little older, the extra digits can be completely removed, making him no different from ordinary people. The hospital is willing to serve as a long-term medical consultant for the mother and child to ensure their continued health.</p>
<h3>Fifth Session of Municipal Council Postponed to 23rd; Zhang Yiqu and Others Request Formation of Resolution Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fifth Session of the First Municipal Council of this city has now been postponed for one week and will be convened on February 23. The registration date for councilors has also been extended to February 16. The draft agenda for this session has been prepared by the Council Secretariat and is as follows: February 23 morning will be the opening ceremony and the mayor's policy report; February 24 afternoon will be the work reports and question-and-answer sessions for the directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Administration Bureaus; February 25 afternoon will be the work reports and question-and-answer sessions for the directors of the Health, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus; February 27 and 28 will be committee review meetings; February 29 is a day of rest; March 1 to 4, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM each afternoon, will be for discussion of proposals. The session is scheduled to last for 11 days, and will adjourn at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of March 4.</p>
<p>The Council Secretariat has already begun to receive proposals from councilors, but the number of proposals is still small. Among them is a proposal from Zhang Yiqu, He Chengfu, Jiang Jiju, Zhao Junhao, and others to form a "Resolution Review Committee" to review the implementation of the resolutions of the previous four sessions of the Council, so as to remedy any deficiencies. It is claimed that among the hundreds of resolutions passed by the Council, those that have been implemented are mostly cases that increase the burden on the people, while cases that alleviate the people's suffering and those related to municipal affairs and reform are often delayed and shirked, and ultimately shelved. It is necessary for the Council to clarify and remedy whether the administrative agencies are faithfully implementing the resolutions. The tasks of the Review Committee are: to count the ratio of resolutions of the Council that have been implemented to those that have not been implemented; to examine the progress of the implementation of the various resolutions of the Council; to review the reasons for the non-implementation of the non-implemented parts of the resolutions, and whether those reasons are justified; to prepare a statistical table of the review results and provide opinions and suggestions to be submitted to the next session for a general review.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Laundry Center; Director and Accountant Suspected of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fu Tongshun, Director of the Health Bureau Laundry Center, and Qin Ruzheng, Accountant, are suspected of embezzlement. Yesterday, the Health Bureau transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation, and Fu and Qin were temporarily detained. The Health Bureau Laundry Center used to wash clothes for municipal government officials and had a considerable income, which was usually self-sufficient. However, at the end of last year, the Director of the Center, Fu Tongshun, colluded with the Accountant, Qin Ruzheng, to report losses to the Health Bureau and request subsidies. The municipal government sent Accounting Director Liu Rucong and Secretary Zheng Bo to investigate and found evidence of embezzlement. The Health Bureau sent a letter along with the two defendants to the District Procuratorate for trial.</p>
<h3>Committee for Review of Enemy and Puppet Occupied Land; Thirteen More Cases Approved; All Civilian Land in Jiangwan and Longhua Airfields to be Expropriated; Part of Jiangnan Shipyard and Other Land to be Returned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The First Group of the Executive Yuan Central Government Committee for Review of Enemy and Puppet Occupied Civilian Land in Shanghai held its second meeting at the Land Administration Conference Room yesterday morning at 9:30 AM to continue reviewing cases of civilian land used by military and transportation agencies. A total of thirteen cases were approved after review, the important ones being: all civilian land within the Jiangwan Airfield (area of 12,698 mu) and the Longhua Airfield (area of 3,670 mu, including existing airfield land) will be expropriated, but the using agency should expedite the expropriation procedures and reissue land prices. The Hongqiao Airfield (area of 2,500 mu, including existing airfield land) will be discussed after the Executive Yuan has approved the using agency. The 800 mu of land leased by the First Naval Hospital and its Third Branch Hospital should be returned, except for enemy property and traitor property, which will be retained for use by the hospitals. Approximately 1,000 mu of land used by the Naval Machinery School and Jiangnan Shipyard should be returned to civilian use, except for the part originally used by the naval machinery and the part that Jiangnan Shipyard is preparing to expropriate.</p>
<h3>Ten Domestic Films Win Awards; Cultural Movement Committee Announces Awards Ceremony to be Held on the 15th of this Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee invited representatives from various film companies to the 14th floor of the International Hotel to announce the process and results of the 36th Annual Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Award for Film. The event began with reports from Committee Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Vice Chairman Liu Wen, who stated: The Cultural Movement Committee held three Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Award competitions last year: Chinese Opera, Fine Arts, and Film. The film competition involved representative works from eleven film companies, totaling 22 films, which were screened daily at the Cultural Hall starting October 23 of last year. The committee invited more than 300 people to participate in the selection, including film and theater professionals, university professors, and heads of various agencies. The selection process was based on five categories: screenwriting, directing, acting, cinematography, and other. Participants scored each category, and the scores were then tallied. The results were the selection of ten films: "The Spring River Flows East" (Kun Lun Production, 91.22 points); "Nepotism" (Cathay Production, 83.46 points); "Mother and Son" (Wenhua Production, 83.37 points); "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon" (Lianhua Production, 83.35 points); "Distant Love" (China Film Production, 81.64 points); "Where Is My Husband?" (Da Zhonghua Production, 81.43 points); "Spring Dream End" (China Enterprise Film Arts Society Production, 81.08 points); "Tian Zi Number One" (China Film Production, 81.07 points); "China's Resistance" (China Film Sichuan Production, 80.36 points); "On the Songhua River" (Changchun Production, 80.1 points). In addition, the Cathay Production film "Masked Woman" had the same score as "On the Songhua River." However, because Cathay already had "Nepotism" selected, the committee ultimately decided to select Changchun's "On the Songhua River" in order to ensure a widespread and fair opportunity to win awards.</p>
<p>Golden Medals, Splendid and Exquisite</p>
<p>The 22 films participating in the selection were all produced by various companies before the Double Tenth Festival last year. There were many other good films at the end of last year, but because they were not eligible to participate, they will be included in this year's selection. As for the ten winning films, the committee has produced two sizes of round gold medals: ten large ones, which will be given to the production companies of the winning films, and smaller ones, which will be given to the directors, main actors, music, set design, and recording personnel of the winning films. The number of award recipients for each film will not exceed ten. Both types of medals are engraved with the words "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Award for the 36th Annual Film Award" and "Presented by the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee." They are glittering gold, splendid and exquisite. The awards ceremony is scheduled to be held on the Theater Festival on the 15th of this month at the Tianchan Theater. The next afternoon, the committee will invite all the award recipients and other theater professionals to hold a grand annual observation and performance.</p>
<p>Efforts in Research, Striving for Excellence</p>
<p>The representatives of the film companies, Xu Suqing and Tao Fangdi, gave speeches. Xu expressed gratitude for the awards and encouragement given to the film industry by the Cultural Movement Committee. Tao stated that the biggest goal of the private film industry in the future will be to develop overseas markets, especially in Southeast Asia, in order to help overseas Chinese understand the domestic situation. Chairman Pan then expressed three hopes to the film industry from the standpoint of the cultural world: that the film industry will work hard to research and strive for excellence so that the art of domestic films can reach international standards; that the film industry should enrich the consciousness of the films themselves so that the audience can receive enlightenment on active construction; the current funding for the Cultural Movement Committee depends on donations from the Pingju actors and actresses from the past. The funding is limited, and there are many things to be done. In order to prevent the cultural movement from being interrupted, it is hoped that the film industry can also respond to donations. Finally, Pan also stated that in the future, the award selection will be expanded to all cultural work. For example, the committee also plans to continue to hold important news selections for the press this year, and will reward the hard-working journalists by selecting and rewarding the best articles based on the significance, thoroughness, and writing of the news.</p>

<h3>Coastal Yangtze Shipping Lines: Returning to Shanghai for a Short New Year's Break</h3>
<p>[Report from our office] Coastal and Yangtze River shipping lines will, as per usual practice, suspend services at the end of the year for rest, or to conveniently inspect hulls and apply paint.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands: Qingtian, Rui'an, and Bao'an Form a Triumvirate: Fourth Letter from Our Correspondent in the Netherlands, Mao Shu Qing</h3>
<p>[The Hague, February 2nd Airmail] Overseas Chinese have two major bases: the South Sea Islands and North America. I have never been to the South Seas in my life. When I was in the United States a few years ago, I had nothing but admiration for the Chinese who pioneered and established themselves, and who have now built homes and businesses. Besides this, the Netherlands is probably next. The Chinese in the Netherlands have a foundation, methods, and ambition. In the European Chinese community, the Netherlands should be a region of considerable importance.</p>
<p>There are roughly a thousand or so Chinese in the Netherlands. The counties of Qingtian and Rui'an in Zhejiang, and Bao'an in Guangdong, represent a "triumvirate" in terms of numbers. The election of European regional representatives to the Legislative Yuan was very enthusiastic in the Netherlands. The three candidates happened to come from three different regions. Hometown ties can sometimes lead to mutual assistance and exchange, but if they are all for elections, deepening the divide between each other is also a drawback.</p>
<h3>Refused to Sail to Enemy Country Laden with Large Quantities of Armaments</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese are all patriotic. When overseas Chinese chat, they often long for the warmth of their motherland. During the war, the Chinese in the Netherlands, like overseas Chinese in many other countries, donated money and offered contributions, sending them back to their homeland one after another. A Guangdong man named Zhang Ban Ying was working on a sea vessel at the beginning of the war. Once, a German transport ship was loaded with a large quantity of armaments, ready to set sail directly for Japan. Zhang Zhen Ying led the Chinese "seamen" in a strike at the Rotterdam docks. I heard that this incident later reached the headquarters of the Nazi occupying forces, who wanted to arrest the leaders of the strike. Now, Mr. Zhang Zhen Ying has long since gone to China.</p>
<p>During the war, there were many moving stories, but also many interesting anecdotes over tea. The Nazi army occupied the Netherlands for five years. At that time, transportation was cut off, and there was a severe food shortage in the Netherlands. They used corn, potatoes, and other mixed grains to fill their stomachs. This taste was, of course, "inedible." I heard that a Chinese man named Lin had a noodle-making machine, which was the only one in the entire Netherlands at the time. Every day, he ground the mixed grains into flour and then made them into noodles for sale, thus making a fortune. A restaurant owner in The Hague told me: "Others also wanted to make this lucrative business, but the mixed grain flour was too hard. Without a machine, it was impossible to turn it into noodles by hand!"</p>
<h3>Number One in Chinese Cuisine: Competing with Foreigners for Food</h3>
<p>Now, there are many noodle-making machines in the Netherlands, as well as dozens of Chinese restaurants of all sizes. From what I remember, there are probably nine in The Hague, ten in Amsterdam, and three in Rotterdam. The large restaurants are decorated luxuriously, comparable only to the Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, USA. Each restaurant's daily turnover ranges from as much as two thousand to as little as five hundred (equivalent to two hundred to five hundred US dollars), which is quite considerable. They rely on gifts and shipments from relatives and friends, from as far as South Africa, Singapore, and Australia, to as near as England and Denmark. Traveling the world, no cuisine surpasses Chinese cuisine. Our hardworking overseas Chinese rely on this "national essence" to compete with foreigners for food.</p>
<h3>A Few Chinese Merchants Are Raising Prices in Violation of Government Regulations</h3>
<p>In addition, many overseas Chinese in the Netherlands are engaged in the cotton textile business. Overseas Chinese purchase cotton textiles wholesale from textile factories and then retail them to users. In Arnheum, I attended a New Year's dinner for cotton textile merchants. After the meal, a Dutch police officer who was invited told us that a few Chinese merchants were raising retail prices in violation of government price controls. The Dutch friend also mentioned that many Chinese overseas Chinese in the Netherlands were "selling candy," which seemed very "indecent." Perhaps he meant well and was offering sincere advice, but hearing it suddenly was very jarring. After the meal, we had a small conversation. First Secretary Si Song Xi of the embassy, in addition to analyzing the actual difficulties faced by overseas Chinese in the cotton textile business, also told him: "China now has the largest textile scale in the world, which is the China Textile Company. In the future, when transportation becomes more convenient, perhaps one day, Dutch cotton textile merchants will have to go to China to place orders." Secretary Si Song Xi also advised them to leave more room for feeling for the Chinese people, and there will always be good results in the future!</p>
<p>I once asked Mr. Yu Zhong, the chairman of the Cotton Textile Industry Association, and he believes that the greatest pain for overseas Chinese cotton textile merchants is the inability to obtain goods from factories, and even if they do, it is not enough. As a result, retailers, in desperation, resort to the black market, exceeding the "price limit." Since the purchase price exceeds the price limit, retail is naturally considered a "black market" by the Dutch government. Therefore, how to enable the factory to increase the wholesale quantity for Chinese overseas Chinese is the crux of the whole problem.</p>
<h3>Lu Chunyang's Treasure Box: A Flourishing Candy Selling Career</h3>
<p>Consul Ding Zhen Wu stationed in Amsterdam, also explained the causes and consequences of the so-called "selling candy" problem that day. I remember: In the twilight light, I often encountered those overseas Chinese who carried wooden boxes like "Lu Chunyang's" herbal medicine box. "Rely on the mountain to eat from the mountain, rely on the water to eat from the water" describes these hard-working overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>In the overseas Chinese community in the Netherlands, at least, there is now a kind of self-awareness: eating is certainly important, but striving for the dignity of the country is even more important. The idea of ​​"stopping selling candy" is circulating among many overseas Chinese leaders. Another strange phenomenon is that The Hague and Amsterdam both suffer from a "labor shortage," and Chinese restaurants cannot recruit Chinese waiters. A restaurant owner told me: "A waiter makes forty guilders a week, and at most earns one hundred and sixty guilders a month. If a candy seller has good business, he can earn one hundred guilders on a Sunday." He added: "Don't underestimate the candy sellers, ah. When they go home, they change their clothes, put down Lu Chunyang's treasure box, and everyone dresses up beautifully!"</p>
<h3>Complex Social Environment and Low Educational Level</h3>
<p>I haven't studied this issue in detail, but I know that the overseas Chinese community sometimes has unexpectedly complex situations and environments. Moreover, because the educational level of European overseas Chinese is generally lower than that of the United States, and the "official price," "private price," and "price limit" of Europe are particularly complicated, today Zhang San was "arrested and taken to the government" for selling at a high price, and tomorrow Li Si's five dan of white rice were suddenly confiscated... All of this has been happening all over Europe in the two years since the war. Some overseas Chinese say that diplomats don't do anything. The consulate says that overseas Chinese don't understand the laws of the host country, the language is not clear, and plus the consulate doesn't have that much manpower and financial resources to be able to negotiate every case smoothly.</p>
<p>In Europe, the situation in the Netherlands is relatively good in this regard. But because there are many overseas Chinese, one consulate is quite busy. The United States, France, and Belgium all have consulates in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and the United States also has a consulate general. If we can open a consulate in Rotterdam, or expand the consulate in Amsterdam into a consulate general, in terms of organization and manpower, we will naturally be able to serve the overseas Chinese better. In addition, if the remittance limit for overseas Chinese can be increased with the consent of the Dutch government, it will benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. I suggest that the Bank of China should establish a small organization in the Netherlands to handle the remittances of one thousand overseas Chinese. I wrote about this idea in the "World Daily" in Chongqing when I first traveled to the Netherlands in 1945. This time I come, I still have the same feeling.</p>
<p>When General Jiang Dingwen came to the Netherlands, he sincerely persuaded the overseas Chinese to abstain from smoking and gambling. In fact, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands are relatively few in this regard, especially in The Hague, it can be said that there are absolutely none. A young overseas Chinese leader in Amsterdam advocates that the "Overseas Chinese Federation" should establish * clubs to encourage playing chess, Beijing opera, or playing billiards, etc., to replace gambling. This is a very positive idea. The Overseas Chinese Federation is a large union of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands. The current president is Mr. Ma Wenshan, an overseas Chinese from Shandong.</p>
<h3>The Next Generation of Chinese People: No Opportunity to Learn Chinese</h3>
<p>I talked to Mr. Ma Wenshan about the issue of "overseas Chinese education." Unfortunately, there is currently no Chinese school in the entire Netherlands. Many "next-generation Chinese people" have no opportunity to learn Chinese. According to Mr. Ma Wenshan's view, if the country can send people to the Netherlands to run the school, fundraising will not be a big problem. An overseas Chinese in Rotterdam, Nang Hua, said: Last year, a British student named Liu, from Sichuan, took the initiative to come to the Netherlands to establish a school, and promised that he himself would be responsible. The overseas Chinese in Rotterdam were extremely excited. Funding, school buildings, and foundations were all prepared, but Mr. Liu suddenly rushed back to London, and from then on, there was no news, and the school was abandoned invisibly.</p>
<h3>Dutch Children, Police, Guns, and Axes: Harm Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese education affects all actions of the overseas Chinese community. In the Netherlands, there are still not many people who can truly read newspapers and know the major events of the country, except for a few overseas Chinese leaders. Before and after the war, many overseas Chinese suffered unwarranted disasters because they "understood" too little. I heard that an overseas Chinese in The Hague was pushed into the water and drowned before the end of the war. In the town of Hevferson near Prince Bernat's palace, Jiang Guanghe, a Zhejiang overseas Chinese selling candy, was beaten to death with an axe by three underage Dutch children, and all the cash was robbed. Another overseas Chinese named Zhang Yueliang, who lived in the city of Utrecht, was shot in the thigh with a pistol by a thug claiming to be a Dutch plainclothes policeman, and later died in the hospital. Stories like this were particularly common before and after the end of the war, when the situation was chaotic.</p>
<p>I heard that before the German army withdrew from the Netherlands, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands were able to live relatively peacefully. It is rumored that General Fugenhausen, who had once been to China, when he served as the commander-in-chief of the German army stationed on the coast of the Netherlands and Belgium, had repeatedly ordered the protection of the lives and property of overseas Chinese. It is also said that an overseas Chinese named Chen, who lived in the city of Saint Dam (near Amsterdam), married a Jewish woman as his wife and had two sons. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, all Jews were killed without exception, but the Jewish wife of this Chen was spared.</p>
<p>At that time, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands had an organization called the "Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Association." All Chinese overseas Chinese were powerful workers in resisting fascism. After the surrender of Germany and Japan in 1945. The Dutch overseas Chinese's celebration of victory "dragon lantern parade" is a glorious page in European history. The Dutch overseas Chinese have ambition. All overseas Chinese in the Netherlands love the country, love the nation, and love the leader. I wish them good health! (At the Harrison Hotel)</p>
<h3>Baoshan Coal Mine Resumes Production</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, February 6th] The Baoshan Coal Mine strike has now returned to normal. According to the West Mountain Baoshan Coal Mine Company, after the victory, Liu Guangzhong was originally responsible for organizing a resumption committee to continue mining. Because Liu was accused of other cases and detained in Hangzhou, the mine was in a chaotic state, and all the workshops were completely shut down. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is concerned about the livelihood of the employees, and has ordered the coal mine industry union to maintain itself, resume production, and designate the chairman of the association, Xu Ai Bao, to preside. The association immediately invited General Ge Tian to be a senior consultant. Ge is the dean of the Retired Soldiers Training Institute and is experienced in industrial and mining affairs. After taking office, he advocated employee cooperation, and the output increased daily, with about ten tons of coal produced per day.</p>
<h3>Yao Mingzhuo Arrested and Enlisted: Jingjiang Military Service Association Committee Resigns</h3>
<p>[Report from Jingjiang, February 7th] All members of the Military Service Association resigned because the resolutions were not implemented, leading to the incident of General Affairs Section Chief Yao Mingzhuo being arrested and enlisted in the military. It is now learned that the committee jointly sent a letter to the county resigning. According to reports, this county was ordered to conscript soldiers, but it did not follow legal procedures. The Lu Guoxing and Lu Guoyin brothers were both conscripted. Their father requested the Military Service Association to release one of them. The association resolved to comply and sent General Affairs Section Chief Yao Mingzhuo to the county government to negotiate with Section Chief Cao Zheng Hong of the Military Affairs Section. There was a slight conflict of words, and before he knew it, Yao Mingzhuo was arrested, sent to the receiving troops, and enlisted as a new recruit. The speaker of the county council and chairman of the Military Service Association, Sheng Yi Bai, went to negotiate and ordered him to write a letter of repentance before he was released. Now, unfortunately, the issue of resignation has arisen.</p>

<h3>Marine Products are Desolate, and the Commercial Market is Confused</h3>
<p>[Aviation News from our newspaper, Hainan Island, 3rd] Haikou City, which has a population of 50,000 to 60,000, has been prosperous on the surface for the past few months, but it hides sorrow in its bones. As the twelfth lunar month is coming to an end and the Lunar New Year is approaching, the commercial market is filled with gray. Mao Zehai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, described it this way at a reception for reporters at the Datong Restaurant one day: "The thirty-sixth year of the Republic is about to pass. Looking back at the Haikou commercial market this year, it has been struggling in extreme difficulties and has not yet recovered to the pre-war situation. In terms of business operations, the number of national currency has increased several times, but it is more of a loss than a profit. In particular, grain merchants, the 98 trade, and medicinal material shops are all facing a downturn."</p>
<p>"Fortunately, only the native product merchants can stand firm. The largest exports of native products from this island are cowhide and rubber. However, although business can be maintained with difficulty, it is also suffering from the difficulties of the tax authorities. Taking rubber as an example, the island's rubber was originally a native product, and the government used to stipulate tax exemption to encourage exports. However, regardless of the explicit provisions of the law, the competent authorities still levy a 7% export tax on native rubber. For example, coconut oil exports are also tax-free. Now, the oil is tax-free, but the barrels for filling the oil must be taxed. Problems like this are like iron chains, restricting the development of Haikou merchants."</p>
<p>"Another problem is the problem between shop owners and shop tenants. Nine out of ten merchants are shop tenants, and they often have their contracts overturned by the owners at will, increasing the rent many times, or using their power to force them to close down and move. Legal judgments are like empty words, which make the Haikou merchants feel disheartened and extremely painful."</p>
<p>"At present, the biggest crisis in the Haikou commercial market is the pressure from foreign capital. Taking the largest store in Haikou as an example, the highest capital amount is only about 4 billion, but recently about five or six companies from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong have come to this city to engage in the native product industry, and each company has a capital amount of more than 20 to 30 billion. Large capital overwhelms small capital, the so-called big fish eat small fish, and Haikou merchants have nowhere to go."</p>
<p>These painful words fully depict the current outline of the Haikou commercial market.</p>
<p>In the past, around the time when the call for Hainan to become a province was the loudest, most merchants held a hopeful heart and took out some capital to expand, and at first glance, the market still had a shadow of prosperity, which made people feel a little comforted. However, the call for provincial status subsided, and the commercial market also underwent a major change. The most significant phenomenon is that except for a few larger foreign goods stores, restaurants, coffee shops, and trading houses that are still brightly lit, many shops light up a kerosene lamp at night, and the whole city is dark and extremely shabby. If you say they can't afford electric lights, that's not the case. The problem is that business is sluggish, and nighttime business is simply too deserted, and it's better to enjoy "saving" than to turn on another electric light.</p>
<p>Due to the failure of commerce to prosper, the high prices of goods, the low level of education, coupled with the serious banditry on the periphery and the impassability of transportation, the fate of Haikou's newspaper industry is quite tragic.</p>
<p>At present, in Hainan Island, in addition to a branch of the Heping News in Yulin, Haikou's newspaper industry is the most developed, with three daily newspapers: Daguang, Minguo, and Pinghe, and two evening newspapers: Tianxing and Shiji, becoming the eyes of the entire island's people. However, the lack of social purchasing power is quite discouraging. According to statistics close to the numbers, the total sales of the five newspapers are less than 5,000 copies, among which Daguang and Tianxing are the most popular, and Shiji has simply stopped publishing in mid-January because it could not stand firm. Speaking of advertising, which is originally the main source of income for newspapers, this road has been blocked due to the sluggish commercial market. Relying on the support of the economy is only newspaper fees, so from the 1st, the daily newspaper has increased from 3,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan per copy, and the evening newspaper has increased from 2,500 yuan to 3,000 yuan per copy from the 25th of last month. The high newspaper fees can be regarded as the highest in the country. Here, each small Yu Kou earth paper of two folio sells for 4,000 yuan. How can readers afford it?</p>

<h3>Academia Sinica Institute of Mathematics Studies: Major Papers on Algebraic Topology Published Mostly in the United States</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News] Since its establishment in July last year, the Institute of Mathematics of Academia Sinica has been headed by Dr. Jiang Lifu. In addition to hiring research staff, it has also actively expanded its library and journal equipment to about 2,000 volumes. Professor H. Weyl, an American mathematician, has also been hired as a professor at the institute. At present, major mathematical research is focused on the research work of elementary number theory and algebraic topology.

According to the recent mainstream of world mathematical research, it is the generalization of known results and the continuation of traditional directions. Algebraic topology is a new and systematic mathematical research that has emerged in the past 20 years. Its development direction also tends to be divided into two major branches: Homology Theory and Homology Theory, which uses algebraic methods to study the concept of topological number theory based on the two major concepts of shape and deformation, and then applies it to the development of group theory and associative algebra. Its guides are modern mathematical masters such as Alexander, Hopf, Lefschetz, Pontrjagin, and Veblen.</p>

<h3>After the Establishment of the International Trade Promotion Association, a Symposium on Import and Export Trade Was Held Yesterday; It Is Proposed to Request the Import and Export Control Committee to Announce the Allocation Numbers for Each Quota Period</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai International Trade Promotion Association held its first symposium after its establishment at the Duchen Hotel at 12:30 noon yesterday. More than thirty Chinese and foreign import and export merchants attended, chaired by Shen Gengyuan, the chairman of the association. After a work report, specific issues regarding import and export trade were discussed. Many people spoke, especially foreign merchants. The main opinions of the members are as follows:</p>
<p>They expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Import and Export Control Committee's termination of merchant registration, believing that it not only hindered the development of industry and commerce, but also conflicted with economic construction plans. The association appealed to the Import and Export Control Committee, but has not received a response to date. When Deng [name missing] Liang, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and others came to Shanghai on the 30th of last month, this issue was also discussed. They now plan to submit a document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which will be forwarded to the National Economic Commission for a decision. It is proposed to request the Import and Export Control Committee to announce the detailed allocation numbers for each quota period in order to reduce external dissatisfaction and criticism. It is hoped that the Import and Export Control Committee will allow the import of foreign goods as samples and advertisements. Some importers' requests for import licenses are approved while others are not. It is hoped that the responsible authorities can explain the reasons for approval or disapproval to the public so that merchants can follow the rules in their business operations. In the past, China lacked experience in managing imports and exports. Today, in the Import and Export Control Committee, there are also few people with practical experience in imports and exports; however, the organization of various trade associations in China is quite strong and sound. Therefore, it is hoped that although the management will still be the responsibility of the original authorities, the actual promotion of work will be handed over to the trade associations for self-management. China's semi-official commercial companies purchase large quantities of goods in the United States, and the convenience they enjoy is beyond the reach of ordinary private companies. For example, the Yitong Company in the United States recently negotiated the purchase of a large amount of chemical fertilizer in the United States, which is quite detrimental to the interests of various import and export merchants. Recently, the Import and Export Control Committee has been encouraging the export of China's industrial products, but according to the opinions of foreign merchants, from the perspective of obtaining foreign exchange, it is more practical to assist exporters in purchasing and exporting China's native products. This is because China's industry is currently still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau, was also invited to participate yesterday and delivered a speech on the spot. The gist of his speech was: Today, the difficulties of international trade lie in the worldwide shortage of US dollars, and the fact that China's rural areas suffered greatly during the War of Resistance. Now, due to internal strife, recovery is difficult. The Financial Control Bureau is involved in international trade [mainly] in cracking down on the black market for foreign exchange. The policy of the Financial Control Bureau is to crack down on illegal activities in industry and commerce and to protect legitimate industry and commerce; on the one hand, to crack down on black market foreign exchange transactions, and to make foreign exchange market prices convenient for import and export trade. The symposium ended at 2:45 PM.</p>
<h3>Small Chinese Stocks Prosper; Yongsha Experiences a Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks belonged to the last half-day of trading before the Lunar New Year yesterday. Credit became even tighter, leading to increased liquidation, causing some panic. Except for small stocks, which continued to prosper, with Innerwear repeatedly hitting the price limit, Yongsha bore the brunt, and the process was extremely unfavorable.</p>
<p>Initially opening lower due to news of US loans, the opening was followed by increased panic. Yongsha's decline was severe. Starting from 692 yuan and 725 yuan, No. 22 and others sold for immediate delivery, while No. 76 and others offered for future delivery. The off-exchange interest rate still opened at 3 jiao 1.5 fen and 3 jiao 6 fen, falling to 670 yuan and 698 yuan. No. 207 and others bought for immediate delivery, while No. 152 and others bought for future delivery. Innerwear was initially listed at the price limit, and Yongsha rebounded to high prices of 696 yuan and 727 yuan. No. 99 and others dumped for immediate delivery, while No. 54 and others offered for future delivery, then retreated to close at 680 yuan and 708 yuan. Innerwear relisted at the price limit, and the momentum of small stocks was very evident, showing many signs of prosperity. As a result, compared with the previous immediate delivery stocks, Rongfeng, Zhongsi, Shangwu, and Zhongni were flat, Innerwear hit the price limit, Wuhe rose by half a percent, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinhua, Zhabei, and Zhongfang rose slightly, Datong fell by one tenth, Xinyi fell by half a percent, and the rest fell slightly. For future delivery, Meiya was flat, Yongsha and Xinhe fell slightly, and Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing rose slightly. Unlisted stocks outside remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Narrow Fluctuations in Foreign Stocks; Government Bonds Initially Weak, Then Recovered</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also saw [narrow] fluctuations yesterday. The credit crunch forced securities firms to liquidate, while foreign firms bought slightly. Yisha opened at 555,000, rising slightly from 550,000 to close at 560,000.

<h3>China Trust Bureau Announces: Recent Market Conditions for Pig Bristles and Tung Oil</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau yesterday announced the following domestic and foreign market conditions for tung oil and pig bristles this week:</p>
<p>Pig Bristles</p>
<p>Foreign pig bristle prices are soft. Chongqing No. 27 black mixed bristles are priced at 3.1 yuan for Hankou goods and 2.15 yuan for Shanghai goods. Tianjin small No. 55 black mixed bristles are priced at 4.7 yuan, with few transactions. The decline in Tianjin [bristles] was more severe due to the sale of futures by exporters. Domestic prices for Chongqing No. 27 black mixed bristles are 39 million yuan per load (duty unpaid) for Chongqing bristles, and 42 million yuan including packaging [costs], 50.5 million yuan for Hankou [bristles], 42 million yuan for Shanghai [bristles], and 92 million yuan for Tianjin small No. 55 black mixed bristles.</p>
<p>Tung Oil</p>
<p>Foreign tung oil prices [were influenced by] the U.S. government's investigation of China's tung oil sales to the U.S. General opinion believes that there is no evidence of dumping, and the tax proposal is expected to be terminated. However, transactions remained sluggish. New York spot prices are 25 cents per pound, and shipping is only worth 24 cents per pound C.I.F. London traders quoted 176 pounds per long ton. Domestic oil prices were stable across the board. Due to tight credit in Shanghai, buyers did not purchase, hovering around 3.2 million yuan per long ton. Chongqing 1.99 million yuan, Hankou 2.95 million yuan. Wanxian 2.24 million yuan. Wuzhou 2.65 million yuan. Guangzhou 2.869 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Both Coarse and Fine Yarns Rise Consistently; Cotton Cloth Market Also Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were characterized by extensive activity to settle accounts due to the upcoming Spring Festival holiday. However, those in the industry with ample funds took the opportunity to buy, and prices rose. As it neared the close, there was considerable hedging, and retail investors also followed suit, with market prices rising steadily. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 60.5 million yuan. Throughout the day, 21-count Double Horse Zhanshan was unpopular, falling by 700,000 yuan, and 10-count Jinbaoxing sales were weak, falling by 200,000 yuan. All other counts of coarse and fine yarns generally showed gains of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened steadily. The street, as the settlement period approached, showed a standstill in both retail and wholesale sales. Retail investors and out-of-town buyers made few purchases. Those in the industry with tight credit sold off spot goods, and prices were once weak. As noon approached, due to the Spring Festival holiday, the Textile Construction Company had temporarily suspended sales, market sentiment turned firm, and the street made some hedging. As a result, among the 12-pound fine cloths, Five Fortunes was actively traded and Dragon Head rebounded by 4,000 to 13,000 yuan. In addition, bleached cloth and Shilin cloth rebounded by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, while other cloths remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers of Wool Raw Materials Stranded in Hong Kong Request Permission to Import</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The fourth phase of the import quota for wool raw materials has now been decided, and the allocation to each factory has been completed. Orders have been placed with foreign countries separately. As for the long-standing quota before the fourth phase of the import quota, it was allocated last month, that is, the wool arriving in port with self-provided foreign exchange was used to offset the quota, totaling 3 million US dollars, but so far, although the factories have obtained the quota, the goods have not yet arrived. The factories deeply feel that the problem is serious due to the lack of raw materials. The reason for not receiving the goods is that most of the wool raw materials in the goods with self-provided foreign exchange are still in Hong Kong, and the government's annual processing regulations stipulate that goods in Hong Kong are not allowed to be imported. It is now learned that various wool textile factories have requested the association to request the Import and Export Control Committee to allow wool in Hong Kong that has been registered with the Import and Export Control Committee to be imported, in order to maintain the current production of each factory, but the quantity shall not exceed 3 million US dollars. The association has scheduled to send representatives to visit Chairman Huo Baoshu within one or two days to present the industry's plight. According to sources, about 1.3 million US dollars worth of wool raw materials with self-provided foreign exchange have arrived in this city, while 1.7 million US dollars worth are waiting to be transported in Hong Kong, accounting for the majority.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw a smooth hedging by industry participants due to relaxed credit. New buying was active, and the appetites of street door shops remained particularly strong, with prices continuing to rise. As it neared the end, ten major British Old Knife and Two Smokes continued to rise by 2.5 million to 2.2 million yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the daily necessities soap market, retail sales were extremely brisk, and buyers were even more eager. Inventories were insufficient, and prices soared. As a result, both Guben and Arrow Knife continued to rise by 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. In addition, Guanghua, Meili, Xiangmao, and others also rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Matchboxes and kerosene also sold actively. US [product name] canned goods were traded at 850,000 to 60,000 yuan between industry participants, and barrel goods were bought for 7.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Guangxin Silver Industry Company Increases Capital and Reorganizes into a Bank</h3>

<h3>Overview of the Cotton Textile Industry in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region in 1947</h3>
<p>— Shi Xinquan</p>
<p>The condition of the cotton textile industry this year, under circumstances such as restrictions on electricity supply, difficulties in the source of raw cotton, soaring cost of living index, and stagnant export trade, failed to fully develop, but was generally good.</p>
<p>Equipment and Operating Rate</p>
<p>At the end of the year, there were a total of 2,910,728 spindles in this region, accounting for 65% of the national total. Of these, private enterprises accounted for 70%, and state-owned enterprises accounted for 30%. There were a total of 37,050 looms, of which private enterprises accounted for 51% and state-owned enterprises accounted for 49% (looms in the replication industry are not included).</p>
<p>The average number of yarn [spinning] equipment for the whole year was 1,424,885, of which 1,182,856 were in operation, with an average operating rate of 83%. There were 18,739 looms, of which 12,172 were in operation, with an average operating rate of 65%. In the process of development, although the external factors for the cotton textile industry have deteriorated, the number of spindles has continued to advance without decreasing.</p>
<p>Production of Yarn and Cloth and Cotton Needed</p>
<p>The total production of cotton yarn by national and private factories this year was 1,394,166 pieces, of which private enterprises accounted for 72% and state-owned enterprises accounted for 29%. The production of cotton cloth was 14,737,632 bolts (the production volume of the replication industry is not included), of which private enterprises accounted for 47% and state-owned enterprises accounted for 53%.</p>
<p>The total cotton consumption for the whole year was 5,248,924 dan, of which private factories used 70%. State-owned factories used 30%, and the total electricity consumption was 384,084,356 K.W.H.</p>
<p>Production Status of Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>According to the estimates published by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Shanghai cotton textile industry needs 105,336 pieces of cotton yarn per month, and the replication industry needs 24,000 pieces of cotton yarn per month. The two industries need a total of 129,336 pieces of cotton yarn, and the total amount of cotton yarn needed for the whole year is 1,552,032 pieces. In addition to the actual production of 1,394,166 pieces of cotton yarn, there is still a shortage of 157,866 pieces. If the small cloth factories outside Shanghai are added, the shortage is [in the] 300,000 pieces range.</p>
<p>Estimated Supply and Demand of Raw Cotton</p>
<p>The final estimate of the national cotton production for this cotton season is 10,738,000 dan. The consumption of the manual textile industry is 2.25 million dan per year nationwide, and the manual cotton textile industry uses about 2.5 million dan. The two needs for cotton are 4.75 million dan. The cotton stored in cotton farmers is about 750,000 dan, so the cotton available for textile use this year is 5.3 million dan. Since the cotton used by factories in this region this year is 5,248,924 dan, the nation still has a shortage of 4 million dan of raw cotton this year, which must be supplied by foreign cotton. Moreover, the domestic suppression of rebellion is in full swing, and traffic congestion is even more severe. The actual cotton that can be supplied to the textile industry is likely to be less than 5.3 million dan. From this perspective, the future prosperity or decline of the textile industry depends on the cotton supply and electricity supply.</p>

<h3>About BCG</h3>
<p>Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association Letter Explains [Omitted Greeting]: I have received a letter from reader Miao Juemin through your esteemed department, and I would like to briefly describe it as follows: According to BCG, it has long been used in European countries after the First World War, but due to the lack of reliable statistics, it is impossible to obtain accurate reports. Experts in the United States dared not try it, and the effect of quarantine and treatment in the United States was extremely significant, even more effective than those in Europe who used BCG. Therefore, the majority of experts in the United States still believe that BCG should not be used. According to the Monthly Bulletin of the American Anti-Tuberculosis Association: December 1947, Vol. xx, No. 12, BCG has been quite effective in Denmark. In New York City, USA, it is believed that isolating tuberculosis patients is better than vaccinating children with BCG. The most recent general view in the United States is that (1) BCG does have short-term resistance to tuberculosis; (2) BCG does not cause severe local reactions when used properly; (3) BCG should be administered by subcutaneous injection; (4) Revaccination and when to revaccinate still require further research; (5) The production of BCG should be exclusively controlled by anti-tuberculosis agencies; (6) Expanded research should continue to fully understand its effects and efficacy; (7) BCG can currently be said to be an aid to tuberculosis prevention and cannot replace current effective treatment methods. In short, China should urgently adopt BCG at this time of national and people's poverty, but do not misunderstand that BCG is as effective for tuberculosis as cholera vaccine, because BCG is still just a type of [treatment] in the trial period. Sincerely, Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Director-General Huang Jiali, January 31</p>
<h3>Telegraph Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>Answered by Shanghai Telegraph Bureau [Question from Mr. Zhang, Chang Le Road]: I am a journalist. I understand there are preferential rates for the press when using the telephone. What are the rates, during what hours, and are there any restrictions? [Answer] Preferential rates for long-distance calls: 30% discount from 12:00 noon to 2:00 PM, 30% discount from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and a 30% discount plus a 7% deduction from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next day. However, these rates are limited to news organizations and reporters on both the calling and receiving ends.</p>
<p>[Question from Mr. Yang Binlong, Fangbang Road]: How are long-distance calls connected?</p>
<p>[Answer] There are three types of long-distance calls: calling by number, calling by name, and message delivery. Each type can be requested as either ordinary or urgent. Ordinary calls are connected in the order that users dial the number. Urgent calls are connected before ordinary calls. The number of call attempts is limited to a maximum of three during peak telephone traffic (except for military, government, and news calls). If a user wishes to connect to a long-distance call, please first dial (113 for users of this bureau, 03 for users of the telephone company). The bureau will record your information, including the desired location, type of long-distance call, telephone numbers and names, and addresses of both parties. Wait for a return call from the bureau's long-distance operator, who will advise the estimated time of connection, and the call can begin. [Question from Mr. Wang Kaiming, Linsen East Road]: Where is the nearest place to send telegrams near Songshan Road? [Answer] Starting February 4th, our bureau opened a telegraph kiosk in front of the Golden Grand Theatre in Ba Xian Qiao. It accepts and sends ordinary, urgent, and night letter telegrams, and also handles long-distance telephone calls. The kiosk is relatively close to your address, so you can go there to send telegrams.</p>

<h3>Sighs of Relief Amidst Disaster</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>People who live in Shanghai's alleyways encounter door-to-door fundraising several times a year, some by monks and others by laypeople. Monks and Taoists usually have a yellow paper donation book with the words "voluntary contribution" written on it. Laypeople have more varied approaches, some bordering on coercion, others a disguised form of allocation. The more modern ones come with slogans and banners, but the donations are gathered more "civilly," making the donors a bit more willing.</p>
<p>Fundraising by monks and Taoists has a long history. Across cultures, religious causes generally rely on donations from devout followers. However, in our country, plagued by disasters year after year, disaster relief fundraising campaigns are constant, be it drought in one area or floods in another. Last year alone, there were floods in Guangdong and Guangxi in the south and floods in northern Jiangsu, not to mention countless other smaller-scale natural disasters.</p>
<p>However, natural disasters alone would be manageable because they eventually end. But in our country, all so-called "natural disasters" are actually the result of poor planning. With years of war and turmoil, who among those around thirty years old has ever lived in peace? As children, we heard stories of the horrors of the "Long Hair" era, but I believe future historians, when writing about China's modern history, might even feel some nostalgia for the Taiping Rebellion.</p>
<p>The combined effect of human and natural disasters has created a kind of "social disaster." This term may be my own invention, but it is very real. For example, refugee relief donations, scholarships for poor students, even disease prevention efforts, as well as various charity fund-raising campaigns through "charity sales," can all be categorized as "social disasters." However, many people simply call them social problems. Yet, if social problems require fundraising to solve them, you cannot deny that it is a kind of disaster.</p>
<p>Indeed, because society is a collective entity, and people have a responsibility to help each other, fundraising does not necessarily imply disaster. For example, in Western societies, in addition to charitable donations for religious causes, fundraising for academic and cultural endeavors is also very common. Many private universities in the United States, for instance, are largely supported by private donations. It is said that one American deposited a dollar in a savings account long-term, intending it to be used as a fund for a certain university a century later. This may be just an anecdote, but it demonstrates that fundraising is common even in wealthy societies like the United States.</p>
<p>However, while both are fundraising, their fundraising is mostly constructive and full of hope. An academic group is created through donations, a university is sustained by donations, and the brilliant academic achievements and cultivation of talent ensure that a dollar's donation yields ten dollars' worth of effect. This is truly using the power of the collective to solve social problems, or rather, to build social enterprises.</p>
<p>But what about us? It's better not to mention it, because it's shameful to even bring it up! How many disaster relief donations (direct or indirect) does an average Chinese citizen have to bear each year? Probably no one can calculate it. But how many victims are truly "saved"? How many social enterprises have been built through fundraising? Those who have read recent newspaper features on Shanghai's winter refugee shelters probably know the answer.</p>
<p>Our people are the most accommodating in the world. They never question these things. Once they have given their money, they feel they have done their duty. They can't control how others use the money. However, international perspectives on donating to China are not so simple. For example, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) recently published figures on aid given to China in the two years after the war (totaling over two billion US dollars). As a result, they cannot help but express concern about China's deteriorating situation two years later. When discussing aid to China, George Marshall also stated that China was not like European countries, and that if the US money spent in China could achieve 70% effectiveness, it would already be considered remarkable. As for where the remaining 30% goes, Marshall did not specify, but can we simply remain indifferent?</p>
<h3>Honored to be With You</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>During one of President Roosevelt's trips, he was accompanied by a reporter from a certain newspaper, who, being newly assigned to this important task, could not help but feel proud of himself.</p>
<p>The President's car was traveling at high speed, and the security guards and police along the way saluted the speeding car. The reporter said to the President, "Mr. President, do you think the car is going too fast?"</p>
<p>Roosevelt smiled and said, "It's going just right—they know who I am."</p>
<p>"I understand," the reporter continued. "But please tell them to slow down a bit, so they know who's with you."</p>
<h3>Supplement to "Cure for Stupidity"</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>The "Free Talk" section on February 4th carried an article by Tongtuo titled "Cure for Stupidity," discussing the effects of a "glutamic acid" extracted from protein on human intelligence. The term "glutamic acid" may be unfamiliar to the general reader. In fact, its sodium salt is the monosodium glutamate (MSG) that we often use.</p>
<p>"Glutamic acid," also known as "glutamic acid," is abundant in the proteins of wheat and soybeans. One of the methods for making MSG is to hydrolyze gluten with hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>There is no fixed standard for the dosage of "glutamic acid" used to treat mental retardation. Some trial reports show dosages as high as 24 grams per day, while others show that about 10 grams per day is effective. Too much can cause insomnia, so it should only be used to treat illness under the guidance of a doctor.</p>
<p>The human digestive system can break down proteins into various amino acids, so eating foods or MSG containing "glutamic acid" should have the same effect as eating "glutamic acid" itself. However, the dosage needed to treat mental retardation is quite high, and the amount in ordinary diets is probably not enough.</p>
<h3>The Reborn Prince</h3>
<p>— Tongtuo</p>
<p>The news of Mahatma Gandhi's tragic assassination has spread around the world, causing widespread grief. According to recent telegrams, his ashes have been scattered in the Ganges River, and his principles of non-violence and spiritual transformation will become historical memories. If one were to witness the cremation of the Mahatma and think of the old man who, just a few dozen days earlier, had been leading a hunger strike to urge India and Pakistan to cease hostilities, one could not help but feel a sense of loss. The thought that comes to mind is, will this generation's sage be resurrected? Of course not, his body has already turned to ashes. However, there is indeed a resurrected prince in India. The story is not long. It began forty years ago and ended in the late summer of the year before last. As we mourn the sage, let us satisfy ourselves psychologically by recounting this resurrection story as follows:</p>
<p>In the Kingdom of Bhowal in Bengal, India, Crown Prince Roy unfortunately passed away prematurely on May 8, 1908. The members of the royal family, including his brothers, wife, and brother-in-law, busied themselves with the funeral, preparing to cremate the body. Roy was a fun-loving person who was close to the common people, so hundreds of people followed the funeral procession through the streets of Darjeeling. Although he was a prince, he was a good "mediator."</p>
<p>At 8 p.m., the funeral procession arrived at the cremation ground. The body was placed on the pyre, but before it could be lit, it suddenly rained heavily. The royal family and mourners all ran to sheltered places to avoid the rain.</p>
<p>Two hours later, the rain stopped, and they returned to the pyre to complete the unfinished funeral rites, but the body was gone.</p>
<p>The relatives quickly divided into several teams to search for it. They rummaged through the ashes in the darkness of the cremation ground but could not find any trace of the body. The disappearance of the body became the talk of the town and became India's top mystery.</p>
<p>However, the next day, it was said that the body had been found, and the mourners went to the cremation site again. There was indeed a gaunt corpse lying on the pyre. Once the branches were lit, the ceremony was completed smoothly, without any unfortunate events.</p>
<p>After a period of time, Roy's widow, Pibhabati Devi, invited her own brother to manage her husband's estate, which had an annual income of nearly US$500,000. The common people did not approve of this act of seizing the country's wealth, and the widow's brother was enamored with Westernization and favored authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Twelve years later, an Indian Hindu monk living in a mountain cave, unkempt and wearing coarse cloth, wandered into the town of Bhowal. A street cleaner accidentally glanced at him, then looked again, and ran into the street to spread the news... the crown prince had been resurrected!</p>
<p>The citizens of Bhowal were amazed by this fact and gathered to see this strange figure. They asked the monk questions, but he refused to answer. People used his complexion, hair, and eyes to prove that he was the crown prince who had died many years ago. Some who had participated in the funeral said in a mocking tone: "I even saw the body turn to ashes."</p>
<p>"You only saw a body cremated," the believers retorted. "Do you remember that on the night of the funeral, the body disappeared?"</p>
<p>The town of Bhowal was divided into two factions. One faction, represented by the brother-in-law, reported to the British authorities that an imposter was claiming to be the deceased crown prince. They had cremated the deceased crown prince, which had been proven by fact. The other faction insisted that this strangely dressed monk was Hua'ai himself. However, the monk did not argue, which alarmed the widowed empress dowager, who wanted to visit this resurrected son. In order not to distrust her own eyesight, she went to an ophthalmologist to have her eyes examined first.</p>
<p>As soon as she saw the monk, she hugged him. "It's my son!" she said firmly. Later, she thought to examine the scars on his body—a decayed tooth, a mole, and a scar on his skin—all of which were good evidence.</p>
<p>Roy's sister invited the silent monk to dinner, personally went to the kitchen, and cooked the side dishes that he loved to eat when he was alive. The monk ate with relish, and the sister hugged him with tears in her eyes. "You are my brother," she said. "You remember the side dishes you like to eat—and I remember how you eat!"</p>
<p>The sister urged him to declare that he was Prince Roy. If the monk did not agree to do so, she threatened to starve herself to death. The monk had no choice but to ride an elephant that night, with drums and music leading the way, and announced that he was the Crown Prince of Bhowal. Thus, an open struggle ensued. The now Roy filed a lawsuit in court, asking the law to judge him as the legitimate heir to the huge estate.</p>
<p>The time was 1920. During the initial trial, the courtroom was packed, listening to the present Roy tell his story—</p>
<p>On the night of the cremation, when the cremator went to avoid the rain, he lay on the pyre and was drenched by the rain for an hour. Then, the body was discovered by Hindus living in the cave below the cremation ground. They moved it down, removed the wet swaddling clothes, and watched over it, praying before the sacred fire. Three days later, he regained consciousness—he was resurrected, but lost all memory.</p>
<p>He lived with the devotees, traveling throughout the country for twelve years. He accidentally became a novice among the monks, and one day he regained his memory.</p>
<p>"I am the Crown Prince of Bhowal," he said. The monks thought he was still suffering from mental disorder, but he was determined to go to the town of Bhowal.</p>
<p>The people who came to testify in court were in disagreement, and no one could agree. Roy's wife strongly opposed it and did not recognize him as her husband.</p>
<p>The case was litigated for a total of twenty-six years and could not be resolved. It was not until the summer of 1946 that the case was heard in the Privy Council in London, the highest judicial body in the United Kingdom. After careful deliberation by the judges, it was ruled that he was Crown Prince Roy. The monk of today regained his former identity as Prince Roy of Bhowal, and relatives and old friends congratulated him one after another. However, three days later, Roy vomited blood all over the floor and died before dawn.</p>
<p>Not long after, at the cremation site thirty-eight years earlier, the body of Prince Roy of Bhowal was cremated again, and this time it was confirmed beyond any doubt, and there was no heavy rain.</p>
<h3>Lu Jiashu Criticizes Wang Xue</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>Although Li Gangzhu did not advocate the Zhu-Lu schools of thought, he criticized Zhu more than Lu, so he also attacked those who followed Zhu Zi without reservation. In the Qing Dynasty, Lu Jiashu was the most devoted to Zhu Zi, and his criticism of Wang Yangming was also the most severe. (He even said that "The Ming Dynasty did not fall to the bandits, but to Yangming.") Gangzhu's "Shugu Waiji" records an anecdote about Jiashu's publication of "Questions on Wang Xue," which is very interesting and is also an amusing story about Lu Qingxian's slander of Yangming. I will record it next: "Lu Jiashu served as Ling Shou, and Shao Zikun served as Qingyuan, both with a good reputation. However, Jiashu did not get along with Zikun because he followed the Lu-Wang school of thought, and they quarreled because of the publication of Zhang Wucheng's 'Questions on Wang Xue.' When he was征喀爾旦, the fuyuan ordered Jiashu to transport 　塞外, and Jiashu did not know what to do, so he sent someone to consult Zikun. Zikun replied in a letter: Such a small matter, and you're so alarmed. If 　辰濠大大變, how will you deal with it? If you just cast the 'Questions on Wang Xue' into the fire, then Yi Zhi's absurd plan will come out." Although this is a teasing book about Jiashu, it really points out the problem of scholars. Jiashu should have nothing to say. Those who easily criticize the ancients often make this mistake. The "Questions on Wang Xue" is still popular in the market today. Do readers also think of this story? However, Li Gangzhu was also very interested in his career and wanted to show himself, but in the end he could not get a chance to try. If he were really used, I wonder how he would compare to Yangming? And how much better would he be than Jiashu? I can't help but laugh at this.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<h3>Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (66)</h3>
<p>When Qiwan heard Yuru mention this question, her expression changed. She said: "According to Zhu Zhai, he has already divorced his wife lightly." Yuru said: "For the sake of love, Zhu Zhai may be able to do this, or even do it secretly, but in a　式 family, he cannot be allowed to do this. I questioned him, and he was stimulated. Maybe he will run away and go with you to other places, but if this happens, then my wife and I will not be able to bear this stimulus in our old age, and my family will be destroyed because of this. I have worked hard all my life, and in my old age, I still have to suffer this pain. Miss Gu—please put yourself in my place and think about how difficult it is." Yuru said here, her face was pale, her old tears were streaming down, and her hands were constantly shaking. Qiwan was originally a warm-hearted and soft-hearted person. When she heard Yuru say that it would affect his family so severely, she felt that this problem was very tricky. She sat back in her chair, biting her lip, frowning tightly, and hesitated to speak. Yuru was experienced in the world. Seeing Qiwan's expression, she knew that she could move her with sincerity, so she stood up and said to Qiwan: "I know that it may not be pleasing to the ear to say these words to young people, but I firmly believe that Miss Gu has been baptized by the old etiquette, and is definitely not the kind of fashionable young lady who only cares about the happiness in front of her and does not care about the consequences. Just say that you and Zhu Zhai are willing to get married, and I cannot stop you. If this happens, I　老 will lose a son, and after Zhu Zhai forms a family, he will lose an　老亲, this kind of spiritual pain cannot be compensated for. Miss Gu, you have lived in a big family, you should know how difficult it is for me as a head of the family to be in this situation! Your love is very pure and noble, I believe, but if this happens, you will not have a title, which is a big loss. On Zhu Zhai's side, he is violating his parents' wishes and forming a small family outside, and he will also be spared from relatives' criticism. On the side of my old couple, we have raised our son to adulthood, and the family has ended up like this. What is there to enjoy! Is this marriage perfect? Is there any regret? Miss Gu is extremely smart, and she is also a famous lady, so she must understand the advantages and disadvantages. Today, I very much hope that Miss Gu will give me a statement. If Miss Gu thinks that what I said is not important, then I am not virtuous enough to convince people, and my words are not credible. Then, my old partner and I can only let fate take its course and let you do whatever you want. I will never stop you, and I will not be responsible for anything in the future." After Yuru finished speaking, she stood tremblingly in front of Qiwan, waiting for an answer. Qiwan was very confused by Yuru's words, frowning tightly, holding her head with one hand, and silent.</p>
<h3>The Most Profitable Business</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>The most profitable business in the world is issuing stamps.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the American philatelic community, there are as many as 11.5 million "stamp fans" in the United States alone—more than 6 million of whom are teenagers. Each time a new stamp is issued, the United States can net $15 million. In 1946 alone, Americans spent $45 million on stamp collecting. Although there are no complete statistics for 1947, it is expected to be even higher due to inflation in the United States.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone is flocking to where the profits are. Many people have taken this opportunity to come up with many tricks. Even the US government is said to have been involved in shady dealings. In the early days of President Roosevelt's New Deal, a few "celebrities" with some status in Washington, DC, inadvertently talked about stamp collecting with a few senior officials in the Post Office Department. They intentionally or unintentionally mentioned that as long as a few stamps were printed slightly damaged during printing, they could immediately become rare items in the stamp market. For example, if a few stamps forgot to be perforated on the edges, they would immediately be worth ten times as much.</p>
<p>Sure enough, soon after, twenty kinds of "damaged" stamps printed by the US government flowed into the hands of certain "celebrities" in Washington, DC—quite a few government officials also received them. President Roosevelt also received this "gift."</p>
<p>These "gifts" gradually circulated. One reckless "insider" handed his share to a stamp broker and told him to sell it at the highest price. The insurance value of that stamp was as high as 20,000 yuan. The philatelic community was first surprised, and then angrily demanded an investigation into the source of these stamps. Questions were constantly raised in Congress, forcing the then Postmaster General (who was also the chairman of the Democratic Party of America) Farley to announce that all twenty kinds of "forgotten to be perforated on the edges" stamps would be sold at face value. However, the US government did not suffer a loss. After this batch of stamps began to be sold, the government netted 2 million yuan in one year, making the postal service the only department in the government that had a surplus when all other departments were running deficits. This kind of "bad stamp" has now become a category of its own in the philatelic community, called "Farley stamps." Some people speculate that this was a masterpiece created by Farley, who was known throughout the United States for his extraordinary wit, and that he relied on this one deal to overcome the financial crisis and leave.</p>
<p>Many small countries rely solely on issuing stamps as their only source of income, such as the Isle of Jan Mayen mentioned in a "New Peach Blossom Spring" published in Free Talk a few days ago. In addition, San Marino is the same. The amount of their stamps sold to foreign collectors is twenty times greater than the amount consumed domestically. Monaco, famous for its gambling city of Monte Carlo, Abyssinia, and Czechoslovakia all rely on selling stamps to foreigners as a major export business.</p>
<p>The famous Belgian physicist Professor Piccard is famous for his exploration of the stratosphere. The funds for his several explorations came from issuing a stamp. When Norwegian aviator Amundsen first attempted to fly to the North Pole in 1925, he also succeeded entirely thanks to stamps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, stamps have sometimes become a backing for invaders. After the First World War, the Italian "poet politician" D'Annunzio used the profits from issuing stamps to lead troops to occupy Fiume. In 1920, Zeligowski of Poland also relied entirely on the power of stamps to forcibly occupy Vilnius in Lithuania.</p>
<h3>On Winter Attire</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>Upon entering winter, men's and women's attire generally undergo a slight change in appearance. Some men who wear Western suits, if they are not "die-hards," have already switched to Chinese clothing when the cold wind begins to blow. The loose robes and wide sleeves are very warm and comfortable, something Western suit wearers cannot enjoy. Since indoor fireplaces or radiators became popular in cities, a coat must also be worn outside the Chinese robe to keep out the cold. This coat has undergone some changes since before and after the war: before the war, riding breeches coats were more common, while after the war, woolen cloaks became popular. If there have been any changes in men's clothing in the past thirty years, the most prominent would be the woolen cloak replacing the riding breeches coat. As for women, they have always been more resistant to cold than men, which can be seen from the fact that they still wear a pair of silk stockings in winter, with nothing else to keep their legs warm. However, in recent years, especially after the war, the trend has changed, and many women wear short cotton jackets and Western-style trousers. It is unknown whether women in the last ten years no longer have the cold resistance of their mothers' generation, and therefore have to wear a pair of trousers that they rarely have the opportunity to wear in addition to silk stockings. I, as a seven-foot-tall man, not only have no discrimination against women, but also respect women's rights, just as I respect the rooster's right to crow in the morning, even if it startles me from my good dreams. However, I really dare not compliment women wearing short cotton jackets and Western-style trousers. This kind of attire seems to give a feeling of being neither fish nor fowl. It is a pity that I lack the interest in research; otherwise, I could examine the attire of the people in *Dream of the Red Chamber*. In fact, today's popular women's short outfits all have the qualifications to put maids under the names of the Twelve Beauties.</p>
<p>From the changes in men's and women's attire in winter, we can see that the two sexes are moving to extremes. The opposing forces of yin and yang can also be seen in clothing. Men have changed from riding breeches coats to cloaks, becoming simpler and more approachable, which is in line with the current difficult economic environment. Because making a living is difficult, one has to plan carefully in everything. Therefore, the cutting and tailoring of clothes are all carefully considered, and the cloak has replaced the coat. Women's clothing style, on the other hand, is inversely proportional to the prosperity of the economic environment. That is, the more difficult the economic times, the more patterns and styles of clothing there are. This expense, of course, is passed on to men after going through several circles. Therefore, it is said that an economically distressed man is further oppressed by fashion.</p>
<p>The Grand Historian said: "Women adorn themselves for those who please them." Now it has become "Men suffer for those who adorn themselves." The "suffering" referred to here has two meanings: one is the economic increase in consumption, and the other is the great discomfort felt psychologically when looking at this kind of incongruous winter women's clothing.</p>
