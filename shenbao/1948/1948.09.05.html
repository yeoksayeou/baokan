<h3>俞叔平案不起訴陳偉達申請再議</h3>

<h3>徐百齊軟禁中照常辦公</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕陶啓明之介紹人財部主任秘書徐百齊，四日全日仍被看管軟禁於財部部長辦公大樓三樓，室外有刑警五人。徐氏現仍照常辦公，有關文件由秘書處送閱。聞徐於被看管前，神情頹喪，雖會與王部長相對，但並無一語。</p>
<h3>政院討論處理陶啓明案　追究拋空所獲消息來源　翁院長及政委認應以公正態度懲處</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕財政部長王雲五四日出席政院臨時政務會議，報吿拘捕陶啓明案之經過，並曾强調辦理該案之決心。王氏報吿畢，翁院長及各政委相繼發言，一致認爲處理該案應着重追究陶啓明拋售永紗所獲消息之來源，至該案之懲處，則應本公正態度，不寬不緊，處以應得之罪。王氏報吿中曾詳細叙述，在擬訂財經緊急處分令中有關各辦法時，曾閉門親自書寫，在準備期間，未爲局外一人所獲知。直至十八日，因通令證券交易所停業之通吿，始着令所部草擬，惟該項文稿之初稿亦無時日塡明，故事實極爲機密，因而主要辦法均未被洩漏。但陶啓明之拋空，亦即係自證券交易所之停業消息而來。王氏並報吿陶啓明拋空之數量，雖爲是日拋出總量之少數，但因陶妻係於十九日上午九時即赴交易所等候開盤，以至爲若干觀望人士投機，跟蹤大量拋售，造成市塲上之大波動。陶某本身獲利雖不過　，但利用職務投機則屬實。王氏報吿達一小時之久始畢。</p>
<p>〔又電〕財長王雲五四日下午三時四十五分晋謁翁院長，即同至政院一號官邸，談話歷一小時始畢，開係商討陶啓明案之如何處理問題。又財次徐柏崗及炎委會副委長吳兆洪，亦於四日下午五時前晋竭翁院長，於六時許始辭出。</p>
<p>監察院長談陶案調查報告緩發表</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕監察院長于右任於接見唐鴻烈·孫玉琳後語記者，陶案情形複雜，其中可能有更大之牽連，故唐，孫兩委員之報吿將暫緩發表。唐·孫兩氏亦稱：此案尙不能發表，其結果亦必俟相當時日後始可獲得。于氏又否認外傳渠曾於四日晨謁總統之說。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕監院派赴滬調査改革幣制前夕拋售大量永紗股票一案之監委唐鴻烈·孫王琳兩氏，四日晨自滬返抵京，兩氏將在滬搜集之各項有關案卷及資料査閱整理後，即赴警廳訪廳長黃珍吾，詢問關於拘捕陶啓明之經過，旋即至刑警　參加該隊對陶啓明之訊問，經過極爲詳盡實真　至下午四時半始吿一段落，並定五日繼續訊問，期能由陶之供詞獲得其次之綫索。兩氏於刑警隊詢問完畢後，即謁監察院畏于右任，報吿滬行調査經過，並硏討繼續展開偵査工作之方針甚久，且認爲該案尙在進行之中，似不宜及早宣布，當經于院長以此項意見電吿王財長，請對偵査陶啓明案詳情嚴守秘密，以利工作之進行，王氏亦表同意。記者四日晚分訪孫·唐兩監委，據談：吾人對陶啓明案之偵訊，在求得更進一步之綫索，亦即必須能査明陶啓明所獲消息之來源，至該院將採何處置，現尙未能決定，將俟所有資料搜集齊全，全盤情勢瞭解後，始能決定提出何種彈劾案抑料正案或糾舉案。孫氏並就滬行發表談話四點（一）此案之破獲，由於滬經管局及警局之協助，得以迅速達成任務。（二）偵査期間，將暫不發表其經過詳情，以免對調査工作有所妨害。（三）該案之犯罪行爲發生於上海，故盼能將各有關人犯移滬辦理。（四）改革幣制乃一大事，無論何人洩漏消息係有意或無意者，均爲不當，故應得合法解決，使以後任何改革或計劃方針等，均得順利推行，而有保障。</p>
<p>陶啟明供詞老練稱拋售出於判斷</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕關於陶啓明於改革幣制前夕拋售永紗股票牟利案，苜都警察廳經）”之值訊，已於三日深夜將全案移交特種刑　法庭，惟陶犯仍羈押於警廳，以　警應繼續澈底偵査。特種刑庭於必要時，並　派檢察官前往主持似査。陶犯至爲狡滑，四日受訊時，對於所詢消息來源時多避不作答，渠稱　已頹喪，頭發已蓬亂。</p>
<p>陶犯四日在刑警隊答覆偵訊時始終態度堅定，語句愼重，因陶係學法律者，且曾服務於司法界者　，故答語每避重就輕兜圈子。惟四日之供詞中，曾發現與陶妻在滬所供相異者兩點，一爲陶稱係十八日下午六時乘飛機赴滬，陶妻則供係乘火車前往，一爲陶妻供陶於十九日一日中曾外出，而陶之供詞中則稱十九日竟日未出。在訊問中，唐。孫兩監委曾反復詢其爲何做此拋售生意？陶答以根據判斷，原爲可投機牟利。再詢其是否獲得某項消息而有此行爲？陶再稱係出於判斷。詢其此種判斷有何因素，陶稱係根據報紙所戰獲得之材料。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕記者頃自關係方面探悉，陶啓明案經首都警廳刑警總隊連續反覆偵訊結果，陶犯現僅已承認曾於十八日晚六時由京乘機飛滬探視母病，惟陶犯經常往來京滬從未乘機，其十五日尙在滬，其母並無何病狀，探病理由難於自圓其說。關於拋售紗股部份，僅承認其妻曾拋出永紗二百萬股，獲利二十餘億，其妻並代其親友拋出大量股票，故陶犯雖堅不承認事先知悉幣制改革消息，惟據本案之主辦人員判斷，以陶犯家境並非寫有，而能如此大膽拋出股票，若非事先有所根據，當絕不致甘冒風險，且以測謊器及錄音機偵訊過程中，陶犯之心理反應已顯示其事先必已獲悉幣制改革消息，况陶犯以一中級職員而能於十八日未經准假，逕行飛滬，實亦頗値研究，其於偵訊時之供詞雖似經深思熟慮，仍難免若干前後矛盾，或企圖規避之處，依偵訊之經過情形觀之，當不難判斷本案似有相當牽涉關聯。</p>
<p>拋售案破獲詳情出動人員達千名</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕記者頃自負責方面獲悉：改革幣制前夕，「隱名人士」在滬大量拋售永紗股票空頭投機牟利一案之破獲詳情，該案係經報章登載，而爲最高當局所深　注意，八月廿八日，總統府電令在滬各有關機關，限於七日內必須破獲此案，當時接奉命令者，除派遣來滬之監察委員唐鴻烈，孫玉琳，監察　參事范體仁，財政部參事周德偉以外，有淞滬警備司令部稽査處，市政府調査處，市警局經濟警察大隊，市黨部，憲兵特高組，金管局，戡趨大隊，工商部特種經濟調查處，證券交易所監理官，及其他有關機關等共十餘單位，出動之人員達一千人，在分頭積極似査之下，卒於奉令後之第五日（九月二日），將此一全國矚目之謎案予以揭曉。首先偵獲此案之主要綫索者，聞爲警備部稽査處經濟組人員，該組組長毛克剛，幹員李吉光，樂嘉芳，吳是沂，余炳眾等，均爲破案之出力人員。八月卅一日，經濟組人員已自鴻興證券號方面査知「八一九」拋空者爲名李伯勤者，與李同夥者尙有兩女客，繼偵悉李伯勤住於延慶路九弄廿號其妹李國蘭處，國蘭之夫爲財政部秘書陶啓明，陶在京任事，每週必返滬一次，八月十八日隋由京匆匆來滬，翌日請假一日，迄晚始搭車返京。陶啓明之進財政部，係該部主任秘書徐百齊所介紹，進財部爲時尙僅二月。其妻平時偶亦玩股票，惟爲數均甚微小。辦案人員於九月一日下午六時起，在延慶路九弄廿號守候李柏勤，李至晚十二時猶未返，自李家僕人口中探悉，李伯勤有時寓於復興路瑞華坊五七號其友高祥生家，當派另一部份人赴高家守候，李吉光等數人則於二日零時進入李國蘭家，以巧妙之方式，迫使李國蘭透露隱情，而得知伊於十九日晨自其夫處獲悉改幣消息後，即偕同其兄及中國石油公司主任秘書徐壯懷之妻楊淑瑤等三人，同赴證券大樓二三七號經紀人杜維屛所主持之鴻興證券號，上午九時抵達該處，九時半開市，即拋出永紗股票每人二百萬股，共爲六百萬股，當時獲利共約八十億元。</p>
<p>辦案人員命李國蘭具結後，繼赴湖南路三四三號石油公司宿舍內，詢問楊淑瑤，楊對前情亦槪予承認。惟李伯勤此人當日在各處守候甚久而未獲。</p>
<p>經濟組人員以此項收獲呈報宣司令鐵吾及蔣督導經國，遂有以後警局傳訊杜維屛·李國蘭等之一幕。在此一案中，除陶啓明·李國蘭·楊淑瑤·李伯勤等四人之罪行已可確定外，關於杜維屛部份，據傳當李國蘭等於十九日晨在鴻興體券號內拋空後，杜於下午亦獲知改幣消息，遂拋出永紗三千萬股，杜原爲多頭，拋出三千萬股以期軋平，至杜所拋出者，聞爲證券一九〇號經紀人樂茂證券號，經濟人林樂則吸進一千六百萬股，餘千萬股則爲天裕證券號張某等數人吸進云。</p>

<h3>從體育瞻國運</h3>
<p>全國各級學校秋季又將開學了。我們且來談談體育，專　體育來　望我們的圖運。</p>
<p>今年七月間倫敦的世運會，如火如荼，我們也不惜化了六百億先開了全運會，選拔着卅五代表去參加，在國家外匯羅掘已窮時硬了頭皮拿出了二萬五千美金，復向僑胞捐了約二三萬美金（捐款實數未知），誠算在十四屆世運會裏飄揚着靑天白日滿地紅的國徽。我曾預料一定吃鴨蛋，今果不幸而言中。體育如此，國運何如？</p>
<p>五十九國參加這次世運會，共一三一種比賽，得分者四十一國，美國得六五二分又二分之一佔首，希臘獲三分之一分居末，土耳其·埃及·南非·朝鮮·波蘭·印度·錫蘭·古巴。菲律賓，均有相當分數，而且有許多人口極少土地極狹的國家還奪得冠軍，例如丹麥四人划船，捷克一萬公尺賽跑和馬術等，澳地利女標槍，瑞典五萬公尺競走和足球等，荷蘭女百公尺賽跑，比利時團體自由車賽，秘魯手槍射擊，埃及經級摔角。我們鄰國印度曲棍球第一，朝鮮拳擊也得了第三各，土耳其田徑賽名列第五；那一個國家不比我們高明？就是日本，同時也在東京創一千五百公尺四百公尺等游永紀錄。</p>
<p>我們出征時，以爲籃球最有把握，但戰不過菲律賓，對智利一塲更是敗得懊喪。其他則足球四對零敗於土耳其；五千公尺預賽樓文敖落選；游泳百公尺自由式吳傳玉跟不上去；陳英郞四百公尺初賽第一組　第一名廿公尺挨不到複賽；黃兩正四百公尺中欄初賽時倒數第二名，與第三名四公尺，自然被淘汰；何浩華自由革賽墜車傷肩，失去二次預賽機會。世遝大會歌「讚美不是屬於我們的」，眞的，一切的讚美都不屬於我們的了。這是警戒，還是諷刺？</p>
<p>中國世運代表團團長五正廷七月廿八廣播，强調「我們參加世運會目的不在得到錦標，而以發揮運動遲德，硏究各國運動技術」，正吻合溫勃爾塲上八呎高的記分牌所書近代世運會創始人古柏丁男爵的詞句：「世運會之所重，不在獲勝，而參加人之要義，不在克服，而在奮鬥」。王氏帶隊出征不是第一次，他心裏如吃螢火蟲，明白得很，老早就知錦標休想，也樂得說漂亮話，着眼於「道德」和「技術」。</p>
<p>我們固有的遷願道德，現代西洋的Sportsmanship完全一致，孔子倡導「揖讓而升，下而飲，其爭也君子」，蘇東坡的「勝固可喜，敗亦可欣」，都足以代表我們的運動道德。然而如今這種道德在那裏？不要說對外競爭時的發揮，就是在不爭時的自已內部關係，攪得够惡化，起口角，動手脚，籃球換隊長，指導員不指導，弄得一團糟，連職員在內，區區只共五十三人，還分派別，鬧意氣，職員與職員間的摩擦，職員與選手間的芥蒂，選手與選手間的隔膜，中國四分五裂自私自利的毒菌，蔓延到各個人的細胞裏。代表團做了今日祖國的縮影，兄弟國牆，還能外禦其侮嗎？在荆棘叢裏可以摘葡萄嗎？「中華代表團國員須知」已關照大家，「必須團結合作，重禮守法」，所得的結果，恰恰是相反。像這樣局面，如何發揮運動道德？</p>
<p>比賽旣慘敗，運動道德所發揮的祗是黑暗面，如果技術上有人存心「歐洲技術不比我們好多少」那句夜郞自大的話，那末我們參加世運會剩下來的還付什麽？本來，失敗是成功之母，然而這裏是要「前事不忘」，「痛定思痛」，才有成功的希望。參加世運「不在克服而在奮鬥，」第一要與自己的缺點奮鬥。不能戰勝自己的缺點，必定要爲缺點所吞噬，正如不能醫好自己的瘡疤，必定要爲瘡疤所苦，甚至被瘡疤把全身腐爛。</p>
<p>勝，要勝得光榮，敗，要敗得磊落。一個人的敗替千萬人增加了勝的意義，打開了一條勝利之路，經騐增加了我們運動生活的度和深度。中華代表歸為之日，就該與全國人士發掘我們自己　　，我們要發出生命的最大力量來　治缺　。我們爲什慶自私？爲什麽自大？更爲什麽一敗塗地？技枝節節的地方讀我們不提吧，我們要從根救治。民族素質不如人，民族生物基礎沒有樹立，那才是自私，自大，和失敗的根本原因（一）</p>
<p>民族素貿和生物基礎太壞，自然身材不够，體力薄弱，忍耐力太差，持久力不足，神經不穩定。一個人身體有問題時，生存憋往往特別強，其結果必然個體大於團體，因此自私心畸　的發達。自私毀壞了我們整個國家，豈但運動競賽而已！科舉·荒災·戰爭·　足·早婚·鴉片·病疫等，無一非斷喪民族的元氣，在遺傳上作反淘汰反選擇！以傾軋排擠的集團，疲瘡殘疾的身體，加之環境不良，鍜鍊無方，上不提倡，下無風氣，如何能與人較短長？這又豈獨在運動上的表現，整個國　就將在這隱微間看得出來，豈不可怕！</p>
<p>奧今配克起自紀元前四百廿年古希臘。當他們異常愛好健康美麗和道德時，國運如日中天，文化最大的禮物是宇宙由自然律所規定的槪念。他們盡力訓練靑年身體，運動選手規定極嚴，必須純血統的國民而未違犯過宗敎和國家規律的作先决條件。許多青年在競技場上夢想奧令配克中勝利而獲利野橄欖花冠的榮譽報酬，人人苦身奮鬥，長期苦練。等到幾個瘧蚊傳到了希臘，希臘便成了歷史上的名詞。戰前德國最盛，世運成績喧赫；目前美國最強，世運成績平均皆好。這可證明一個國運的黃金時代，先要有一個身體的黃金時代。</p>
<p>爲今計，必須恢復我國固有的民族素質，發揮運動的精神。目前急救之道，無過於實行民生主義，提高人民生活。一時雖不能家裕戶足，也該苦樂平均，食物配給，「兒童第一，靑年第一，」然後「幼有所長。」否則縱有好種而撒在　薄土壤內，也是無濟於事，何况我們優生已好久失傳了。如何現代化我們國家，請瞧四年後芬蘭赫爾轉基塲上我們健兒角逐有否轉機，而運轉機又須待國民素質的改善，優生，衛生，再加上體育，是決定我們素質的要素，我們該從此作出發點。國家民族的復與大業，當於運動中見其端倪。</p>

<h3>日人和平怪論</h3>
<p>主由中美蘇三國巨頭　解決中國及日本問題</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京四日電〕日本戰前「認識中國運動」會員大田，四日在中文「中國日報」上發表致張羣之公開函，主張在上海召集蔣總統。史達林。杜魯門。三巨頭會議，以一解決日本問題，且以統一中國及維持東亞及舉世之和平。」</p>
<h3>美國是否退出南韓問題　盼聯大能予解決　美不願受蘇壓力而退出韓境</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城四日電〕美國目前期望於將在巴黎舉行之聯合國大會，以解決美國在朝鮮之主要問題如何不失面子而退出朝鮮。美國從未有意於美蘇對朝鮮問題發生不和，但目前已經發生爭執，美國亦不能似因受蘇聯壓力而讓步。朝鮮半島由中國之東北延入黃海，恰介於中日兩國之間。中日兩國人民仍需掙扎於共產及民主，於二者之間擇取其一，現正密切注視美蘇在朝鮮之較量，其程度較美蘇兩國人民更爲關切。此間美人深恐美國如在朝鮮事件中失算，東方全部均將分嚐其後果。因此美國正極端小心準備一項計劃，務使聯合國大會以壓倒多數，擁護於本年五月十日在聯合國視察下所選舉產生之南韓李承晚總統之政府。美國將試行使聯合國判斷蘇聯拒不允許聯合國視察北韓選舉一事實鑄成大錯。美國並擬指出蘇聯所稱，北韓於八月廿五日之共黨方式選舉，能反映人民願望之說，成爲滑稽劇。經聯合國擁護美國在韓政策後，美國可退出朝鮮並非由於蘇聯之壓力，但由於聯合國譽爲「成績美滿」之佔領工作之合理完成所致，此項計劃將使國務院及陸軍部官員釋然於懷，被等過去在政策上有重要之歧異。陸軍部深知以軍事觀點而言，南韓實不足固守。即使在最後將使共黨管制全韓，陸軍部亦欲撤退駐地美軍。日本素以朝鮮爲指向日本心認之七首，而圖使蘇聯退出朝鮮。美國不願如此，但知戰事如告發生，此事即辦不到。國務院則顯然堅持繼續佔領朝鮮，以宣示世界，尤其東方，謂美國決定履行其一切國際上義務，國務院與陸軍部現均期望聯合國大會對彼等之朝鮮問題給予答覆。</p>

<h3>台糧武裝走私巧取豪奪作風奇猛</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　吳守仁</p>
<p>本報台北一一日航訊〕台潤個食政策，是安定台灣的最大力量，很少有人需要爲三餐而擔　的。但惟其因爲台灣糧食價格和內地相差太遠，因此，也成了園險家致富的捷徑。經濟學的原理告訴我們要「地畫其利」，要「有無相通」，台灣在前者是充分做到了，而後者却是由政府在獨任其艱的。爲什麽？因爲內地糧荒太嚴重，太廣泛了，假使「有無相通」成爲無秩序，無統計，無限制的行動，則罄盡台灣所有的糧食產量，仍救不了內地的　饉，一定要造成「救不了田鷄却餓死了蛇」的笑話。台灣省政府瞭解這種不能兩全的情况，因此封鎖了民營糧食出品的途徑。然而利之所在，誰不想　此禁臠？尤其是冒險家們自有他們的手法。</p>
<p>冷眼看這幾個月來滬獗的糧食走私，眞是巧取豪奪，軟硬手段兼而有之。範圍有大有小，次數也不勝枚舉，而設想之週，作風之猛，實足令人咋舌。</p>
<p>六月二日深夜，台中縣警察局警官孫才良，率同警士多名，以食米一百五十四包從鹿港偸運出口，不幸被鹿港警所的警員鄭振賢發覺，更不幸的是這個鄭警員職位雖卑，却是一個硬漢，以致並沒有給對方的警官身份懾伏，而把走私的食米全部扣留，交給當地住民名呌粘章的保管。想不到在三日的深夜，孫才良竟然率帶多人滿携武器，捲土重來，並且更加運了二百多包食米，威脅粘章將扣留的食米一百五十四包刧走，合共四百餘包，浩浩蕩蕩地走私而去了。</p>
<p>俗語說：「紙包包不住火」，糧食雖在武器的掩護下飄然引去，風聲却也傳揚開來。台中的興論界覺得負責緝私的人武裝走私，實在太不像話，於是秉了一股正義，鳴鼓而攻之起來，事能就此擴大。台中縣長龔履端覺得不能作「阿家翁」了，手令縣警局長陳鼎查報，而陳局長的申覆竟出乎意料之外，乾脆來了一個「查無其事」的結論。不幸的是與論界太好管閑事，新攻勢蔓延了省垣的報紙，省警務處特派專員許振庠會同龔縣長親至鹿港寳地調查，認爲罪證確鑿，即將全部人犯移送台中地檢處偵查，這件案子本來應該在依法辦理的詞令下告一段落了，不幸又是「冷鑊裏的熱票子」，台中縣新聞記者公會忽在八月卅日發表一個通電，說這案的人犯最近已給法院在「證據不足」的判令下全部釋放了，但他們認爲證據非常充分，不應該釋放，並且還說孫才良是一個普通公務員，本身決沒有鉅款購糧走私牟暴利，也決沒有胆量公然率衆武裝走私，斷定一定有幕後主使犯。他們要責問台中警察局長陳鼎爲什麽要在案發之初，尚圖掩飾，說什麽「查無其事」？</p>
<p>現在這個充滿火藥氣的通電是發出來了，省垣各機關各報社都收到，然而「秀才紙上談兵」，能區出什麼結果，實在難說。看本報八月廿八日南京電，知道糧食部已在注意台糧的走私，我們很希望因中央的關切而促起地方當局的注意。同時，退一步來說，走私到內地口岸，還算是利益不外溢，記者却十分担心糧船會駛向只長一海之隔的異邦去。</p>

<h3>紗價限度徘徊</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開時因紡建尚未掛牌，遲至十二點許，紡建公司懸牌拋售，要有六區公曾辦理聯合配銷，各紗廠復各在門市自行開售，供應充沛，塲內人心頓覺平穩。惟市上銀根依然鬆弛，各方零星需胃尚不寂寞，喊價俱在限度盤旋。一般貨主，自睹市情不振，紛紛吐售，因此形成明平暗軟之勢，全日成交一百三十三件。</p>

<h3>價站原盤未動　食米交易稀少　麵粉回降油市疲軟</h3>
<p>米市站住限價，惟交易益見淸稀，良以產地價格堅昂，若按限價出售，殊有虧本之虞，故貨主甚少脫意，因格守限價，故供應稀少，粳米更覺缺乏，行家之樣檯上，貨樣寥寥，秈米交易較多，價亦仍站限度，糙秈米高貨連袋十七元開出，江西機米亦按限略有開出。南北二市到貨共計四八九二石。</p>
<p>麵粉　略見回挫，執貨者因棧單出貨期限迫近，咸多吐出。供應驟增，實銷吸納亦多，交易興旺，收市價格終因供多而下降。老車粉由七元四角回降爲七元三角五分，計跌一角五分。兵船終跌五分，紅蜂略疲五分，雜牌粉均挫一角及一角五分不等，麩皮仍站限價，小麥廠盤十元〇三角。</p>
<p>雜糧　交易依然淸稀，黃豆價與產地倒掛，故極少開出。杜豆成交二百包，苞米北帮胃　平淡，價略挫二角，紅糧價低，客帮納取，市轉堅昂。元麥交易不多，蠶豆按限價有供應。菉豆開出不多，芝蔴由行家供應百包，本街每戶一包，生仁供少交稀，）開封生仁成交二三百包。</p>
<p>食油　疲落，晨開油廠擬以限價大量供應，散戶聞訊虛軟，於限價乘先脫手，結果廠方反都未開出，中植廠按限開生菜油，祗售去二十担，回龍貨吐出頗多。豆油初開五十一元五角，收市五十一元，生菜油收市四十六元，各降一元。生油微挫一角，小車莊油未開出，舊桶小車喊原價未成交。豆餅存少，大生元廠以大元餅二千片開出，價按限度，大統及義記亦有開出。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>綢市升登限度以後，塲內交易幾已停頓，一般棧單持有者，無法活動，乃向各廠提取現貨。因之邇來各廠家發行所門庭若市，空前繁忙。而各門售店銷，以限價故，實銷奇旺，均向各廠設法添補。但廠方則以原料昂貴，不敷成本，對各另售店舖，加以限制，每家准購一條。</p>
<p>八一九以後，白報紙鮮有交易，且進購亦非易事，尤以二號紙道林紙等供售更稀。聞紙號門售報紙每次限購五十張，並須由購尸（如印刷局等）出具字條。工業原料，俱登漲限，市塲到者轉少，各廠實需亦稀，故門市及市塲交易，均見寥落。</p>
<p>寗夏出新棗杞產量大减，色枯粒小，先後到來兩批，因不合銷令，以致乏人問津。黨參，川芎，停住限價。</p>
<p>銅錫業原料部份，如銅塊，錫塊，鉛，鋅，鋁等「八一九」市價業由公會審定，送呈社會局核示。又製成品如銅皮，銅管，銅絲等類，將由各銅廠會同辦理呈報。</p>
<h3>汽油分配欠公允輔導處請予糾正</h3>
<p>本市工商輔導處爲機製國貨工廠等請求增加汽油配額事，奉土商部令對工業用油之數，許加調查後，發現油配會之汽油分配額，極不公平，昨特簽請工商部予以審核糾正。原文稱：「各機製國貨工廠為增加工業用汽油配額，　救各廠停工，以免工人失業，釀在嚴市之後果起見，特請汽油分配委員會增加汽油配額，以維持民族工族之危機。查自汽油分配委員會成立後，統制各項用途，非但供不應求，且分配亦殊欠允當。該會以輸入總額一百五十萬加侖分配一般用油佔一百二五萬加侖，上廠僅得二十五萬加侖，其中且包括民航用油，寳太偏苛不公。因此使全市工業大起恐慌，例如橡膠業須以汽油爲溶化劑黏合劑，乃係橡膠主要原料之一，祀配十萬加侖，不足供應實需之半數。如不設法改善，各工廠機力必有被迫停工之虞。工廠一停不，失業有數萬工人，其後影　所及，實不堪設想。緣橡膠爲政府指定之重要工業，非但于民生日用品不可缺，且所　飛機胎汽重胎軍耗與國防有關，即其他工業，亦各有其主要性。交通用油，旣可以由國產酒精，代用或摻用，惟橡膠業之原料汽油，並無他品可代。總之，統制分配，應先洞悉各業之內情，再斟酌輕重，權衡利害以行之。今統制但實行于上海一市，而外埠則放任如故，事實上毫無效益，而且弊竇叢生，爲挽救本市大多數工人失業之非常危機，擬墾請令上海汽油分配委員會重行核定分酌數量，增加工業用油配量，削减私人所用汽油，或令改用摻用國產酒精。並應限止非本市牌照車輛，不准在本市加油，如是奄奄一息之工業，尚有挽救之希望云。滿限於上海。天津·靑島·廣州·外洋輪船可以到　之四埠。內地紗廠花紗布至交貨港埠運費，亦須自己負担。至紗布內外銷比率，則由　營處統籌，並非由各廠繳額內劃分之。</p>
<h3>茶市脚地堅固</h3>
<p>內銷茶昨進出互有，依然缺乏起伏，至於洋莊茶市，趨勢擴形秀色，良以執主感於目前國外華茶需要甚殷，而價格方面，亦頻趨佳境，丙此態度愈爲樂觀，市氣遂告向榮，脚地堪稱穩固。</p>
<p>茲據樂中人云：自我國政府對出口物資，限制價格後，聞最近陝際市塲，不特茶葉漸告抬頭，餘如桐油，生絲，皮毛等，俱在透露曙光。照此情形，國內經濟旣可穩定，同時更能爭取較多外匯，鞏固幣制。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>英算和國文</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>英文，算學和國文，普通並列爲重要科目。抗戰以來，一般學生的國文程度漸漸低落。以前在福建，招考新生時看國文的卷子，總覺得不大像樣；以爲是看慣了算是文化水準較高的卷子的緣故。返省以來，看入學試驗的國文卷子也已四五次了，這才知道國文程度是普徧的低落了。爲着提高國文程度，敎育部曾經通令過；國文不及格的不能升級，不能畢業，入學考試不能錄取。照着戰前的眼光來看，現在國文可取的太少了。辦了學校總得招收學生，只好降格以求，或者放寬分數，使得形式上符合法令，國文程度實在並沒有怎樣提高。</p>
<p>杭州高級中學入學考試的卷子一向密封；國文卷子照例分了部份批閱，一個人專看解釋的，一個人專看翻譯的，一個人專看作文。這次我看作文的一部份排在最後，因此要附帶總結分數了。我記得很淸楚，一千三百多本卷子中只有一本是八十七分，其次八十一分，第三八十分；甲等一起不過三本，其餘最多的不過七十九分，也只有一個，大半都是不到六十分的。連不到十分的也有好幾本。</p>
<p>爲着避免人情關係，拆開密封的地方來看，還是只有一個碼號的。所以登記和結算分數的辦事人，只知道第一名是幾號，第二名幾號，並不知道取了的人的姓名。要到開招生委員會的時候，當塲由敎務主任呼唱第一名幾號，由別的辦事人查出來報告，什麼人，是那里畢業的。名次以總成績計算，英文算學等科只要不是零分就行，國文必須到達標準；因此又有一個辦事人當即查出來報告國文幾分。這次錄取一百五十名，我始終沒有離開會塲，聽得很淸楚，國文最多數八十七分的終於沒有報告出來，居然落第；次多數八十分的也沒有取。第三八十分的雖然取了，名次並不高。前三名的國文分數都不多。很明顯的，於無形中表現着：國文好的別的功課就差，科學好的國文並不也好。國文和科學頗有難以兼長，簡直是有勢不兩立之槪的了。這是因爲國文旣繁且難，學生的精力時間有限，顧此失彼，實在難以兩全。以前做文章，本來是要讀書十年才能算是「不通」的，否則通「不通」的資格都談不到。現在同時要學習許多功課，要做得通，談何容易！</p>
<p>可是，高級中學考上了的國文欠淸通，總是一個問題。爲着住意英文算學和理化等科，不能專心研究國文；短短的三年中，國文不會有什麼進步，將來畢業了，還是欠淸通的。但這於升入大學關係並不重大，錄取與否，還是重在英算的。這實在是個大問題。不消說，時至今日，要國家富强，必須使得科學發達，勢必减少國文的研究時間；國文是須使得由繁難而改良爲簡易的了。不過這並非文言和白話的問題。無論白話文言，只求淸通，注意文法就是，還不十分費時。所謂讀書十年才能算得不通，是要在「文章」上面裝進許多古典成語，要讚許許多多古書，這才非有長時間的用功不可了。所以，花費時間的是在「國學」。國學並非不要，但如要每個人都注重，不但顧不到科學，連作文都難以淸通了。中等以上的學生，作文應該淸通，不及格的不能畢業，不能錄取。不過文字的淸通，和國學不該混作一談，爲着一般的靑年計，爲着國家民族的前途計，爲着國文的本身計，國文和國學應分作兩門；國文是主要科，國學在文科才是主要科。這樣，不至於再國文成續差的高高錄取，國文在八十一分以上的反而落第。相信目前贊成這種主張的人還很少，但我確信這是需要分別的！</p>
<h3>賣書記</h3>
<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>爲了應付生活的急需，我最近三次去賣書。</p>
<p>第一次還相當順利，我帶了一部歷代名印選錄去賣，那是明代嘉靖年間的刋本，也是我家收藏的一部老古董，雖然那目光犀利的書商還不住的挑剔，說出並非原楊印存的外行話，但到底還給我一個相當可觀的價錢，足以使我買八斗老米。於是我在聊以自慰的條件下出讓了這一部著名的印譜，而帶了幾斗米回到了寄住的家。</p>
<p>第二次是非常不順利，因爲我帶了一部韓文考異。這文起八代之衰的韓昌黎，並不爲書賈所重視，跑了幾家收買舊書的舖子，結果都不肯用買破紙的價錢來買，而且書商還誠懇的向我說明，這一類古老的文章不如一部平常的小說有銷路。我也承認他的話對，因爲在現今讀文章的人已如鳳毛麟角，而膾炙人口的小說却眞個是不脛而走。於是我決定仍把這部古文放起來，等到有人提倡韓文時再來出賣。</p>
<p>第三次也是出乎尋常的不順利，雖然我拿的是李笠翁的兩本傳奇和一部黃眉故事，可是這些說部和劇本也似乎趕不上時代了。而在書商的眼光下還特別鄙視這些竹紙木刻本，儘管在過去已保存了幾十年，然而的確是趕不上新聞紙的堅靱的，於是我在書店的過低估價下，又依然帶回來。因爲倘若兩部詞曲還換不到幾枝香烟，那我又何妨保留這名作的警句來把玩咀嚼呢。</p>
<p>從第三次後，我便不再想去賣書了。</p>
<h3>我願意做官</h3>
<p>— 康君</p>
<p>三十一日自由談有翼君所撰「我願意當敎員」一文，我讀了以後心裏有一種異樣的感覺。他麒意做個敎員，我到想做「官」。我在大學裏念的是政治，畢業後也曾像翼君一樣東走西托，期得一官半職，但是缺少鑽營拍馬奉承手腕的我，毫無所獲。出乎意料地，由友人的介紹，會到一所中學裏去做代課敎員，後來竟至由代課而正式敎書了。這樣敎員飯一連吃了四年，現在還在繼續執敎。像翼君所謂「發展」固然是有，而校長的讚美一年多一年，被校長利用的地方（當敎員的專心敎學，校長唯利是岡，生財有道）也一年多一年。校長一年富一年，但是我的收入反而一年少一年（按物價指數及一般薪給來說），生活愈來愈淸苦了。雖然我跑到敎育界來吃敎員飯並非是我的本願（恰巧和翼君的本意相反），但是八浮於事的今天，謀事困難，用非所學，豈止我和翼君！翼君願敎書而做官，我願做官而敎書，如翼君的「官」能和我的「敎員」來對掉一下，豈不大佳！</p>
<h3>竊賊自述</h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>最近本刋時有談及竊賊的文字，看到他們的偸竊方法與玩笑眞是層出不窮，日月新異，倒也頗感興趣。某西洋雜誌有一篇竊賊自述的文章，他很坦白地指出：竊案的發生，大半是由於事主的疏忽。</p>
<p>他說：，有許多人喜歡在離屋之前把門窗及百葉窗都關上了——尤其是到別處去度暑假或寒假的時候。這等於很明顯地告訴了竊賊們：這座屋子裏沒有人住，請你們放心來吧！</p>
<p>也有許多人自作聰明，爲了要使竊賊以爲屋子裏有人起見，在離開的當兒故意把浴室或臥室內的燈開亮，豈知賊比你更聰明，他們在偸竊之前的白天一定要預先「打樣」一下，看見白天燈亮了，又無人影，就知你是故弄玄虛，晚上儘可從從容容地來幹一下。</p>
<p>還有人愛在牛奶瓶中留下一張條子，告訴送牛奶的：幾時到幾時離開此屋，暫時停送。這給竊賊們知道了，又是一個好機會</p>
<p>報上的社會新聞版及時人行蹤的新聞是竊賊們的一個最好的情報供給處。因爲他們知道一且主人離開後，僕傭們不免要疏忽起來，他們就可趁此機會大大的一顯身手。並且這種人家，大多是豪門權貴，收獲必定可觀！</p>
<p>竊賊大部在深夜進行。當他們「工作」完畢後，並不急於要逃。如果在一間空屋內，他們儘可在屋內休息一會，待天明後，拿了幾隻手提箱或皮包之類，整好衣冠，不慌不忙大大方方地走出來，別人還以爲他們是去搭早班火車的呢！</p>
<p>在有人的屋子裏，如果覺得已爲事主發覺，他們會利用常人懼怕的心理，做出一種悽厲的怪聲，使膽小的主人以爲是「鬼呌」，而不敢起來抓；或學貓狗的呌聲來解除事主的疑心。更有的化裝成鬼怪模樣嚇人。</p>
<p>對於警鈴。狗。鎖，及其他一切防賊的東西，一個有經驗的竊賊是毫不在意的。因爲偸竊根本是一種鬥智與心理研究的嘗試，他們的成功倒也決不是偶然的呢！</p>
<h3>談馮超然之畫</h3>
<p>— 潘公殿</p>
<p>前日在赴京道中，讀本報自由談胡亞光君「張子祥與馮超然」一則，驚奇不置。按張子祥名熊別號鴛湖外史，秀水人，生於淸嘉慶八年（一八〇三），卒於光緒十二年（一八八六），年八十四，工花卉，亦畫山水，書宗黃山谷，確爲同光時代名畫家。惟胡君謂馮超然先生受業於子祥，則殊非事實，而誤指超然先生爲某剃頭店學徒，尤爲荒誕無稽。超然先生自號愼得居士，又號滌舸，署其畫齋曰嵩山草堂，蓋僑寓滬濱，卜居於嵩山路者殆二十年。民三十年辛已冬（一九四一），其門弟子爲彙刊畫集，以壽其六十華誕。即此推算，可知其於光緒十二年時，僅五歲耳，何從爲學徒？更何能事翰墨？超然先生爲武進人，幼年嘗事帖括，入邑庠，嗣則精硏繪事，與費龍丁先生遊，同學詩於沈約齋明經，費好金石，馮則好丹靑。弱冠始遊金　。迨光緒三十三年丙午遊京師，歷時甚久，見聞愈廣，造詣益深，且力却權貴之聘，翩然返吳門，由是其畫更爲世重。光宣之交，方移寓海上，春秋佳日，輙過李平書吳昌碩諸氏，品題書畫，其意直以畫爲隱耳。超然先生之畫，山水而外，人物花卉開不工，能取四王之絕業，發揚而光大之，蓋秉董巨之正宗，融南北爲一派焉。狄平子龐虛齋兩氏，均精鑒賞，世所周知，獨於超然先生之畫，俱多所推許。則胡君之作，固不値識者一笑矣。</p>
<h3>膚</h3>
<p>據平市報載上海金融界電訊，有人依金圓券開支票，因「圓」寫作「元」而被拒收，乃向銀行業務局詢問，局長李君解釋云，雖無明文規定，但幣制令旣是金圓而非金元，則必照寫「圓」字，方能生效云。此事甚趣，具有幽默風光，可作大改革大議論等許多熱　節目中一個間雅的小岔曲。</p>
<p>向來支票發生疑義，不外乎：（一）數目不符，如無透支預約而所開支項超過存項之頭；（二）數目字不淸，如草率簡略誠有塗改痕迹之類；（三）印艦不符，或印色獨糊，爲防冒領愼出入起見，輒拒收或令重具，理所當然也。數目字之必須「大寫」，亦因筆墨較多，不易添改，末加一「正」字，則與西人支票上數目後之Only同其防弊作用。惟「圓」與「元」間發生問題，尚不多見。</p>
<p>「圓」字不但合於本義，而且筆畫較多，若關係財款出入，自以多寫幾　爲宜。所謂合於本義，因幣本是「圓」形，不論是金是銀，是古是今，是中是外，故幣制又名「圓法」。至於鈔劵固是方形（長方）之紙，然乃硬幣之代表，硬幣之本形，仍是圓的。不但此次新劵功令大書「圓」字，即自前淸創新幣以來，亦莫不書「圓」。此外，私人紀錄及函札之以「元」代「圓」，只爲省事，好在無關出入耳。此次上海被拒之支票，未知詳情如何，但可縣想，若寫請付「金元券若干元若干角若干分」，則上一「元」字，顯與數目字隔離，縱添筆畫，亦不能多支幾文，即無實際責任關係。下一「元」字，頗可塗改數目字，（如寫伍拾元，若將「元」字，改寫「萬」字，大發財矣！）然其下仍須「元」，能再　下一字乎？總之，在「元」字上招財，總是不易，故歷來防弊者亦不注意於此。而在寫票者則以寫「圓」爲常，所謂「小心，沒有錯」。</p>
<p>在前淸初製鈔券時，正面漢文爲「圓」，背面洋文即是Dollar，因舊時只用銀兩，而幣式及製法則仿白歐美，即以抵制舶來之通貨。但到後來，因歐美硬幣之質量旣不止一格，而與「中國造之洋錢」，其成色亦略有分別，乃改用譯音Yuan，故「圓」之創始，由於Dollar，而以Yuan爲歸宿。</p>
<p>「元」之一字，因明太祖名「元　」，令「元年」改　「原年」，故明初曾有一時期之消失。淸初則康熙帝名「玄　」故凡「玄黃」「玄武」等等均改爲「元」字，淸代「元」字則大走紅運而盛行。</p>

<h3>New Situation Unfolding in Northern Jiangsu: National Army Surrounds and Attacks Remnant Bandits Reaching Shuyang</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] Military news: A new situation in northern Jiangsu is unfolding. National Army forces are gathering along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. The Commander of the Ninth Pacification Zone, Li Liangrong, is currently stationed in Xinan Town, Suqian, directing four divisions, including the XX Division, to advance into northern Jiangsu and surround and attack the remnant bandit forces of Chen Yi in northern Jiangsu. Siyang, Suqian, and Shuyang have all been reached by large army units on the outskirts of the cities. The recovery of these three county seats is essentially a foregone conclusion. They are now actively preparing military supplies and food for the people to avoid affecting the advance. Furthermore, the newly appointed Commander of the First Pacification Zone, Zhou Yan, has officially assumed office in Huaiyin, emphasizing to the welcoming masses that political and economic warfare is more important than military warfare, and requesting the people in the jurisdiction to actively report corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The crack troops of the National Army have completed their deployment in northern Jiangsu. The bandits who were originally based in the Lianshui and Shuyang areas attempted to flee towards the coastal areas north of Funing (i.e., the northern area of the Longhai Railway). After the National Army advanced and attacked, on the 3rd and 4th, they annihilated the 104th Regiment of the 2nd Column of bandits in Shuyang, capturing over 600 bandit officers and soldiers above the battalion level, more than 20 heavy machine guns, more than 50 light machine guns, and 900 rifles. They are currently expanding the victory.</p>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch, 4th] The Deputy Commander of the First Pacification Zone and Director of the Nantong Command Post, Lieutenant General Gu Xier, arrived in Nantong from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th to assume his new post. After landing, Gu first inspected the people's self-defense forces, and then entered the city by car, meeting with reporters in the afternoon. According to the talks, the Central Government attaches great importance to the situation in northern Jiangsu and has already made specific plans, and there may be new developments in the short term. All circles in Nantong are scheduled to hold a grand welcome meeting on the morning of the 6th. It is reported that the command post is setting up political work and staff departments, as well as general affairs and military law sections, and personnel appointments will be announced within days.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 4th] The National Army in eastern Henan continues to launch a clearing and suppression war in the area east of Huitingji. The main force of the 9th Column of Chen's bandit forces in central Henan is entrenched near Mixian County, with a unit of over a thousand bandits. They raided Xinzheng on the 3rd, and the National Army is resisting them.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 4th] A certain unit of the National Army in Qihe recently used a penetrating tactic to launch a surprise attack deep into the area near Changqiao northwest of the city and Yancheng north of the city, killing more than 200 bandits, destroying two bandit warehouses, and capturing more than a dozen people.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] The Hankou Air Force continued to bomb and destroy more than 30 bandit army boats in Shenhu (north of Xiantao) on the 4th. Over a thousand bandits of Li Renlin's bandit forces entrenched in Bajiaomiao northeast of Jingmen have fled to Xianju (seventy li northwest of Jingmen) after being suppressed by the National Army. In addition, a large number of scattered bandits north of Mianyang have been annihilated in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 4th] The war in western Henan has become a stalemate. The 50th and 53rd Brigades of Kong Congzhou's bandit forces suddenly invaded the west again. After Shanzhou was captured again, another unit of more than 800 bandit troops invaded Duzhai from Lushi in the north. Our national troops retreated to Guandaokou, south of Yexiang, and engaged in fierce battles with the bandits. The bandits in northern Shaanxi are currently conscripting soldiers and levying grain in their occupied areas, as well as organizing and training stretcher teams, actively replenishing their forces. More than 2,000 bandits from Wujiahe, Baishui in central Shaanxi, continued to cross the Luo River and fled back to Zongmu Town.</p>
<h3>Eastern Hebei Marches into Hexiwu, War Clouds Gather on the Jin-Sui Border</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] The National Army east of Tongxian marched into Hexiwu on the morning of the 4th, and the remnant bandits escaped to the northwest.</p>
<p>[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 3rd] War clouds are gathering on the Jin-Sui border. There are currently 20,000 bandit troops in Zuoyun and Youyu, seeking a roaming target between Gui Sui and Datong. Bandit army outposts were recently discovered at Caoyaozi outside of Shahu Pass, but there has been no contact near Tianjiazhen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] On August 28th, the Xi'an Air Force coordinated with a large formation of heavy bombers dispatched from the Beiping base to bomb the Jingxing Coal Mine, all hitting their targets. Several fires broke out, and silver-white smoke filled the sky, judged to be our planes hitting the bandit's highly explosive ammunition. Later, according to ground reports, the bombed areas were indeed explosives and ordnance factories.</p>

<h3>The Price of Rice for September Has Not Been Decided as of Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the price of rice for September, the Executive Yuan had already decided yesterday morning (the 4th) to maintain the same price as in August without adjustment, but it was heard that the U.S. representative, based on the U.S. aid bilateral agreement, insisted that it should be sold at a 5% discount on the market price for the last five days of August. After repeated consultations, our government representative insisted that stabilizing prices was the top priority at this time and should not be adjusted. The U.S. side then compromised, agreeing to change to a 25% discount, changing the price of each market dou to 1.5 Gold Yuan, which is still cheaper than the market price of 2 Gold Yuan per dou. It is reported that our government has not yet agreed as of 6:00 PM yesterday.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, New York, 4th] The Howard newspaper group reported on the 4th that the U.S. Department of the Army has submitted the "first batch of deliverable reports" to the Chinese military mission this week. The remaining reports will be submitted to China next week. The U.S. Department of the Army has notified China that the department can save millions of rounds of ammunition, hundreds of thousands of rifles, and light machine guns for supply to China. However, the department stated that it must charge China "replacement value."</p>
<p>The Chinese side stated that in some cases, this price is several times higher than the original price. The Chinese side is quite disappointed, because each price increase is equivalent to reducing purchasing power.</p>

<h3>Xu Baiqi Continues to Work While Under House Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Xu Baiqi, the introducer of Tao Qiming and the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, was still being watched and placed under house arrest on the third floor of the Ministry of Finance's office building all day on the 4th, with five criminal police officers outside the room. Mr. Xu is still working as usual, and the relevant documents are sent to him for review by the secretariat. It is reported that Xu looked depressed before being placed under house arrest, and although he met with Minister Wang face to face, he did not say a word.</p>
<h3>Government Council Discusses Handling of the Tao Qiming Case; Tracing the Source of Information for Profiteering; President Weng and Political Commissioners Agree Punishment Should Be Handed Down with Impartiality</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu attended the temporary Government Council political affairs meeting on the 4th to report on the process of detaining Tao Qiming, and also emphasized his determination to handle the case. After Mr. Wang's report, President Weng and various political commissioners spoke one after another, unanimously agreeing that the handling of the case should focus on tracing the source of the information obtained by Tao Qiming in selling the Yongsheng yarn short. As for the punishment for the case, it should be based on an impartial attitude, neither lenient nor severe, and mete out the deserved punishment. Mr. Wang's report described in detail that when drafting the emergency financial and economic measures, he personally wrote them behind closed doors, and during the preparation period, no outsider was aware of them. It was not until the 18th, when the notice ordering the suspension of business of the stock exchange was issued, that the ministry was ordered to draft it. However, the initial draft of the document did not have the date filled in, so the facts were extremely confidential, and thus the main measures were not leaked. However, Tao Qiming's short selling came from the news of the stock exchange's suspension of business. Mr. Wang also reported that although the amount of Tao Qiming's short selling was a small portion of the total volume sold that day, because Tao's wife went to the exchange at 9:00 AM on the 19th to wait for the market to open, it led to speculation by some onlookers, who followed suit and sold a large amount, causing major fluctuations in the market. Although Tao himself did not profit much, it is a fact that he used his position for speculation. Mr. Wang's report lasted an hour before it was completed.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu paid a visit to President Weng at 3:45 PM on the 4th, and together they went to the No. 1 official residence of the Government Council. The conversation lasted for an hour, and it is said that they discussed how to handle the Tao Qiming case. In addition, Finance Vice Minister Xu Bogang and Wu Zhaohong, Deputy Director of the Inflammation Committee, also paid a visit to President Weng before 5:00 PM on the 4th and left around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Supervisory Yuan President Tan Delays Release of Investigation Report on the Tao Case</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren, after receiving Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, told reporters that the Tao case is complicated and may involve even greater implications. Therefore, the report of Commissioners Tang and Sun will be temporarily delayed. Tang and Sun also said: This case cannot be released yet, and the results will only be available after a considerable period of time. Mr. Yu also denied the rumor that he had visited the President on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Supervisory Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Wanglin, who were dispatched by the Supervisory Yuan to Shanghai to investigate the case of the large-scale selling of Yongsheng yarn stocks on the eve of the currency reform, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th. After reviewing and organizing the various case files and materials collected in Shanghai, the two went to the police department to visit Director Huang Zhenwu, inquiring about the process of detaining Tao Qiming. Immediately afterwards, they went to the Criminal Police Brigade to participate in the team's interrogation of Tao Qiming. The process was extremely detailed and factual, and it did not end until 4:30 PM. They also decided to continue the interrogation on the 5th, hoping to obtain further clues from Tao's confession. After completing the interrogation at the Criminal Police Brigade, the two visited Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren to report on the investigation process in Shanghai and to discuss the direction of continuing the investigation for a long time. They also believed that the case was still in progress and should not be announced early. President Yu then telegraphed this opinion to Finance Minister Wang, requesting that strict confidentiality be maintained regarding the details of the investigation of the Tao Qiming case to facilitate the work. Mr. Wang also expressed his agreement. Reporters separately interviewed Supervisors Sun and Tang on the evening of the 4th. According to them: Our interrogation of the Tao Qiming case is aimed at obtaining more in-depth clues, that is, we must be able to ascertain the source of the information obtained by Tao Qiming. As for what disposition the Yuan will take, it has not yet been decided. It will not be possible to decide what kind of impeachment case, correction case, or accusation case to file until all the materials have been collected and the overall situation has been understood. Mr. Sun also made a four-point statement on his trip to Shanghai: (1) The cracking of this case was due to the assistance of the Shanghai Economic Management Bureau and the police bureau, which enabled the task to be completed quickly. (2) During the investigation period, the details of the process will not be released temporarily, so as not to hinder the investigation work. (3) The criminal behavior in this case occurred in Shanghai, so it is hoped that the relevant perpetrators can be transferred to Shanghai for handling. (4) Currency reform is a major event, and it is inappropriate for anyone to leak the news, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, it should be resolved legally so that any future reforms or planned policies can be promoted smoothly and protected.</p>
<p>Tao Qiming's Confession is Sophisticated, Claiming the Selling Was Based on Judgment</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Regarding the case of Tao Qiming profiting from selling Yongsheng yarn stocks short on the eve of the currency reform, the Capital Police Department, after continuous interrogation, transferred the entire case to the Special Criminal Court late on the 3rd. However, the suspect Tao is still detained in the police department so that the police should continue to thoroughly investigate. The Special Criminal Court will also send prosecutors to preside over the investigation when necessary. The suspect Tao is very cunning. When interrogated on the 4th, he often avoided answering questions about the source of the information. He said that his spirit had been flagging and his hair was disheveled.</p>
<p>Tao was always firm in his attitude and cautious in his words when answering the interrogation in the Criminal Police Brigade on the 4th. Because Tao is a law graduate and has served in the judicial system, his answers were evasive and circuitous. However, two points were found in the confession on the 4th that differed from the confession made by Tao's wife in Shanghai. One was that Tao claimed he flew to Shanghai at 6:00 PM on the 18th, while Tao's wife said he went by train. The other was that Tao's wife said Tao went out for a day on the 19th, while Tao's confession claimed he did not go out all day on the 19th. During the interrogation, Supervisors Tang and Sun repeatedly asked him why he did this short-selling business. Tao replied that he made a judgment that it was possible to speculate and profit. When asked again whether he had obtained any information that led to this behavior, Tao again said it was based on judgment. When asked what factors influenced this judgment, Tao said it was based on materials obtained from newspapers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] This reporter learned from relevant sources that, as a result of continuous and repeated interrogations by the Criminal Police Brigade of the Capital Police Department, the suspect Tao has only admitted that he flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 6:00 PM on the 18th to visit his sick mother. However, Tao often travels between Beijing and Shanghai and has never flown. He was still in Shanghai on the 15th, and his mother had no symptoms of illness, so the reason for visiting her is difficult to justify. Regarding the sale of yarn stocks, he only admitted that his wife had sold 2 million shares of Yongsheng yarn, profiting over 2 billion. His wife also sold a large number of stocks on behalf of her relatives and friends. Therefore, although Tao firmly denies knowing the news of the currency reform in advance, according to the judgment of the person in charge of this case, Tao's family is not wealthy, and he would not have dared to sell stocks so boldly without prior knowledge. Moreover, the psychological reactions of the suspect Tao during the interrogation using a lie detector and tape recorder showed that he must have learned of the currency reform news in advance. Furthermore, it is also worth studying that Tao, as a mid-level employee, was able to fly directly to Shanghai on the 18th without asking for leave. Although his confession during the interrogation seemed well-considered, it still inevitably contained some contradictions or attempts to evade responsibility. Judging from the circumstances of the interrogation, it is not difficult to judge that this case seems to have considerable implications and connections.</p>
<p>Details of the Cracking of the Short-Selling Case: Personnel Involved Reached 1,000</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] This reporter recently learned from responsible sources the details of the cracking of the case of "anonymous individuals" massively selling Yongsheng yarn stocks short in Shanghai on the eve of the currency reform to speculate and profit. This case was reported in the newspapers and attracted the deep attention of the highest authorities. On August 28, the Presidential Office telegraphed to the relevant agencies in Shanghai, ordering them to crack the case within seven days. At that time, in addition to the Supervisory Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, Supervisory Counselor Fan Tiren, and Finance Ministry Counselor Zhou Dewei, who were dispatched to Shanghai, there were the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Investigation Department of the Municipal Government, the Economic Police Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, the Special High Group of the Military Police, the Gold Management Bureau, the Suppression Brigade, the Special Economic Investigation Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Supervisor of the Stock Exchange, and other relevant agencies, totaling more than ten units. The personnel involved reached 1,000. Under the active investigation, on the fifth day after the order was received (September 2), this mysterious case that attracted national attention was finally revealed. It is said that the main clues to the initial discovery of the case were personnel from the Economic Group of the Garrison Headquarters' Investigation Department. Group leader Mao Kegang, officers Li Jiguang, Le Jiafang, Wu Shiyi, Yu Bingzhong, and others were all contributors to solving the case. On August 31, the Economic Group personnel learned from Hongxing Securities Company that the "819" short seller was named Li Boqin. Li's partners also included two female customers. It was then learned that Li Boqin lived with his sister Li Guolan at No. 20, Lane 9, Yanqing Road. Guolan's husband is Tao Qiming, a secretary of the Ministry of Finance. Tao works in Beijing and returns to Shanghai once a week. On August 18, Sui rushed from Beijing to Shanghai, took a day off the next day, and then took a car back to Beijing late at night. Tao Qiming's entry into the Ministry of Finance was introduced by Xu Baiqi, the chief secretary of the ministry. He has only been in the ministry for two months. His wife usually plays stocks occasionally, but the number is very small. Starting at 6:00 PM on September 1, the investigators waited for Li Boqin at No. 20, Lane 9, Yanqing Road. Li had not returned by 12:00 AM. From the mouth of Li's family servant, they learned that Li Boqin sometimes stayed at the home of his friend Gao Xiangsheng at No. 57, Ruihua Fang, Fuxing Road. Another group of people was sent to wait at Gao's house, while Li Jiguang and several others entered Li Guolan's house at 12:00 AM on the 2nd. In a skillful manner, they forced Li Guolan to reveal the truth, and learned that after she learned of the currency reform news from her husband on the morning of the 19th, she and her brother and Yang Shuyao, the wife of Xu Zhuanghuai, the chief secretary of the China Petroleum Company, went to Hongxing Securities Company at No. 237, Securities Building, which was managed by broker Du Weiping. They arrived there at 9:00 AM, and when the market opened at 9:30 AM, they sold 2 million shares of Yongsheng stock each, for a total of 6 million shares, making a total profit of about 8 billion yuan at that time.</p>
<p>After the investigators ordered Li Guolan to make a written statement, they went to the Petroleum Company dormitory at No. 343, Hunan Road, to question Yang Shuyao. Yang also admitted to the previous situation. However, Li Boqin had been waited for in various places that day for a long time without being found.</p>
<p>The Economic Group personnel reported this gain to Commander Xuan Tiewu and Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, which led to the subsequent summons of Du Weiping and Li Guolan by the police bureau. In this case, in addition to the crimes of Tao Qiming, Li Guolan, Yang Shuyao, and Li Boqin being determined, regarding Du Weiping, it is said that after Li Guolan and others sold short in Hongxing Securities Company on the morning of the 19th, Du also learned of the currency reform news in the afternoon and sold 30 million shares of Yongsheng yarn. Du was originally a bull, and sold 30 million shares in order to flatten his position. As for those sold by Du, it is said that broker Lin Le of Yue Mao Securities Company, Securities No. 190, absorbed 16 million shares, and Zhang of Tianyu Securities Company and several others absorbed the remaining 10 million shares.</p>

<h3>Forecasting National Fortune from Sports</h3>
<p>The autumn semester of schools at all levels across the country is about to begin again. Let us talk about sports, focusing on hoping for our national fortune through sports.</p>
<p>The World Games in London in July were in full swing. We also spared no expense to spend 60 billion to open the National Games and select 35 representatives to participate. When the country's foreign exchange was almost exhausted, we bit the bullet and took out 25,000 US dollars, and also donated about 230,000 US dollars from overseas Chinese (the actual amount of donations is unknown), sincerely calculating to have the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth fluttering in the 14th World Games. I once predicted that we would definitely get a duck egg, and now unfortunately my words have come true. If sports are like this, what about the national fortune?</p>
<p>Fifty-nine countries participated in this World Games, with a total of 131 events. Forty-one countries scored points. The United States ranked first with 652 and a half points, and Greece ranked last with one-third of a point. Turkey, Egypt, South Africa, Korea, Poland, India, Ceylon, Cuba, and the Philippines all had considerable scores, and many countries with very small populations and extremely narrow territories even won championships, such as Denmark in four-person rowing, the Czech Republic in the 10,000-meter race and equestrian events, Austria in the women's javelin, Sweden in the 50,000-meter race walk and soccer, the Netherlands in the women's 100-meter race, Belgium in the team cycling event, Peru in pistol shooting, and Egypt in lightweight wrestling. Our neighbor India was first in hockey, and Korea also got third in boxing. Turkey ranked fifth in track and field. Which country is not better than us? Even Japan simultaneously set swimming records in Tokyo for 1,500 meters and 400 meters.</p>
<p>When we set out, we thought basketball was the most promising, but we couldn't beat the Philippines. The game against Chile was even more frustrating. In other events, the soccer team lost 4-0 to Turkey; Lou Wenao failed to qualify in the 5,000-meter preliminary round; Wu Chuanyu couldn't keep up in the 100-meter freestyle swimming; Chen Yinglang finished first in the first group of the 400-meter preliminary race but was almost 20 meters away from qualifying for the semi-finals; Huang Liangzheng was second to last in the 400-meter hurdles preliminary race, 4 meters behind third place, and was naturally eliminated; He Haohua crashed his car and injured his shoulder in the freestyle race, losing two qualifying opportunities. The World Games theme song, "Praise is not for us," is true. All the praise does not belong to us. Is this a warning or satire?</p>
<p>Wu Zhengting, the head of the Chinese World Games delegation, emphasized in a broadcast on July 28 that "our purpose in participating in the World Games is not to win medals, but to promote sportsmanship and study the sports techniques of various countries," which coincides with the words of Baron de Coubertin, the founder of the modern World Games, written on the eight-foot-high scoreboard in Wembly Stadium: "The most important thing in the World Games is not winning, but the essence of participation is not overcoming, but striving." This is not the first time that Mr. Wang has led a team on an expedition. He knows very well, like eating fireflies, that there is no hope for medals, and he is happy to say nice things, focusing on "morality" and "technology."</p>
<p>Our inherent modesty and morality are completely consistent with modern Western sportsmanship. Confucius advocated "bowing and yielding before ascending, drinking after descending, and their competition is gentlemanly," and Su Dongpo's "victory is of course pleasing, and defeat is also gratifying" can represent our sportsmanship. However, where is this morality now? Not to mention its manifestation in external competition, even in the internal relations when there is no competition, it is messy and deteriorating, starting quarrels and physical altercations. The basketball team changes captains, the instructor does not instruct, and everything is a mess. Including the staff, there are only 53 people in total, but they are divided into factions and act on emotions. There is friction between staff members, resentment between staff and athletes, and estrangement between athletes. The bacteria of China's division, selfishness, and self-interest has spread to the cells of each individual. Is the delegation a microcosm of today's motherland? Can we resist foreign insults with brothers fighting within the walls? Can you pick grapes in a thorny bush? The "Notice to Members of the Chinese Delegation" has instructed everyone that "we must unite and cooperate, respect etiquette and abide by the law," but the result is exactly the opposite. In such a situation, how can we promote sportsmanship?</p>
<p>Since the competition was a dismal failure and the sportsmanship that was displayed was only the dark side, if someone deliberately believes the arrogant statement that "European technology is not much better than ours," then what is left for us in participating in the World Games? Originally, failure is the mother of success, but here we must "not forget the past" and "learn from the pain" in order to have hope of success. Participating in the World Games is "not in overcoming but in striving," and the first thing is to strive against our own shortcomings. If we cannot overcome our own shortcomings, we will surely be swallowed by them, just as if we cannot heal our own scars, we will surely suffer from the scars, and even have our whole body corroded by the scars.</p>
<p>Victory should be glorious, and defeat should be magnanimous. One person's defeat increases the meaning of victory for millions of people and opens a path to victory. Experience increases the breadth and depth of our sporting life. On the day of the Chinese delegation's return, they should work with people across the country to discover our own , we must unleash the greatest power of life to cure shortcomings. Why are we selfish? Why are we arrogant? And why are we so completely defeated? Let's not mention the trivial details, we must cure from the root. The root cause of selfishness, arrogance, and failure is that the national quality is not as good as others and the national biological foundation has not been established (1).</p>
<p>If the national quality and biological foundation are too poor, the natural result is insufficient height, weak physical strength, poor endurance, lack of persistence, and unstable nerves. When a person has physical problems, the survival instinct is often particularly strong, and the result is inevitably that the individual is greater than the group, and therefore the selfishness is abnormally developed. Selfishness has ruined our entire country, not just sports competitions! The imperial examination, famines, wars, foot binding, early marriage, opium, epidemics, etc., have all cut off the vitality of the nation, causing adverse selection and reverse selection in heredity! How can we compete with others with groups that are mutually hostile and bodies that are tired and disabled, coupled with a bad environment and lack of training, with no promotion from above and no prevailing atmosphere below? This is not just a manifestation in sports; the entire country will be visible in these subtle things, which is not frightening!</p>
<p>The Olympics originated in ancient Greece in 420 BC. When they were extremely fond of health, beauty, and morality, the national fortune was at its peak, and the greatest gift of culture was the concept that the universe is governed by natural laws. They did their best to train the bodies of young people, and the regulations for athletes were extremely strict. The prerequisite was that they must be citizens of pure blood and have not violated religious and national laws. Many young people dreamed of victory in the Olympics on the arena and receiving the honor of a wild olive wreath. Everyone worked hard and practiced hard for a long time. When a few mosquitoes carrying malaria reached Greece, Greece became a historical term. Germany was at its peak before the war, and its performance in the World Games was remarkable. Currently, the United States is the strongest, and its performance in the World Games is good on average. This proves that the golden age of a national fortune must first have a golden age of the body.</p>
<p>For the sake of the present, we must restore our country's inherent national quality and promote the spirit of sports. The most urgent way to save the situation is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and improve the people's lives. Although it may not be possible for every family to be prosperous for a while, we should at least have an equal distribution of joy and hardship, and food rationing, with "children first, youth first," and then "the young will be cared for." Otherwise, even if we have good seeds and sow them in barren soil, it will be useless, let alone that eugenics has been lost for a long time. How to modernize our country? Please see if there will be a turnaround for our athletes competing in the Helsinki arena in Finland four years later, and the turning point depends on the improvement of the national quality. Eugenics, hygiene, and sports are the essential elements that determine our quality, and we should start from here. The great cause of national revival should be seen in sports.</p>

<p>Beiping Police Bureau Closely Monitors the Market</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 4th] The Communist bandits in the Ji-Zhong (Hebei-Central) area of North China have recently been actively plotting to sabotage the government's currency reform policy.

The highest-ranking cadres of the Goutou City (沽頭市) bandit group decided on six strategies: (1) Select and send cadres from the City Work Department to infiltrate Tianjin and Beiping, collude with merchants seeking illicit gains, and purchase materials at high prices to drive up commodity prices. (2) Secretly order local workers, divided into small groups of three or five, to infiltrate the food, cotton cloth, and gold banknote markets, using fake buying and selling tactics to raise market prices, so that unscrupulous merchants will resume hoarding and profiteering, creating market chaos.

<p>[United Press Paris, 4th] France's most critical political crisis since the war has entered its second week, with the tense situation worsening daily.

<h3>Syngman Rhee Asks the United States to Continue Aiding Korea</h3>

Rhee's letter to President Truman was released today, stating: "Your Excellency is undoubtedly very clear about the environment of our country. It is precisely because of this environment that I have to represent the people of our country to request the US government to continue the aid that has been generously provided in the past three years, so that the government of the Republic of Korea can implement its previously stipulated economic reconstruction and national defense security plan." Rhee listed the factors that contributed to the economic hardship and requested assistance in the following areas: providing economic assistance to enable the Korean government to obtain the materials and machinery necessary for the survival and economic activities of the Korean people; assisting in obtaining supplies and equipment to enable the government to maintain law and order and internal security; assisting in the reconstruction of various basic industries to enable Korea to develop its domestic economy and foreign trade; and that Korea should continue to be listed on the International Emergency Food Committee's food distribution plan.

<h3>Absurd Japanese Peace Theory</h3>
<p>Heads of the United States, China, and the Soviet Union to Resolve the Problems of China and Japan</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 4th] Ota, a member of the pre-war Japanese "Know China Movement," published an open letter to Zhang Qun in the Chinese-language "China Daily" on the 4th, advocating for a meeting of the three giants—President Chiang, Stalin, and Truman—in Shanghai to resolve the Japanese problem and to unify China and maintain peace in East Asia and the world."</p>
<h3>Whether the United States Will Withdraw from South Korea: Hoping the United Nations Can Resolve It; The US Is Unwilling to Withdraw from Korea Under Soviet Pressure</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 4th] The United States currently hopes that the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in Paris will resolve the major problem of how the United States can withdraw from Korea without losing face. The United States never intended for discord to arise between the US and the Soviet Union over the Korean issue, but since a dispute has now arisen, the United States cannot seem to concede under pressure from the Soviet Union. The Korean peninsula extends from Northeast China into the Yellow Sea, situated precisely between China and Japan. The peoples of China and Japan, who still need to struggle between communism and democracy and choose one of them, are closely watching the contest between the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea, to a greater extent than the people of the United States and the Soviet Union. Americans here deeply fear that if the United States miscalculates in the Korean affair, the entire East will share the consequences. Therefore, the United States is extremely carefully preparing a plan to ensure that the United Nations General Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, supports the government of South Korean President Syngman Rhee, elected on May 10 of this year under the observation of the United Nations. The United States will try to have the United Nations judge the fact that the Soviet Union refused to allow the United Nations to inspect the elections in North Korea as a grave error. The United States also intends to point out that the Soviet claim that the communist-style elections in North Korea on August 25 can reflect the will of the people is a farce. After the United Nations supports the US policy in Korea, the United States can withdraw from Korea, not due to Soviet pressure, but due to the reasonable completion of an occupation deemed "very successful" by the United Nations. This plan will relieve State Department and War Department officials, who have had significant policy differences in the past. The War Department knows that from a military point of view, South Korea is not worth defending. Even if it ultimately leads to communist control of all of Korea, the War Department wants to withdraw US troops stationed there. Japan has always regarded Korea as a dagger pointing at the heart of Japan and seeks to make the Soviet Union withdraw from Korea. The United States does not want this, but knows that if war breaks out, this will be impossible. The State Department, on the other hand, clearly insists on continuing the occupation of Korea to declare to the world, especially the East, that the United States is determined to fulfill all its international obligations. The State Department and the War Department now both hope that the United Nations General Assembly will provide an answer to their Korean problem.</p>

<h3>The President Concerned About the Situation in Shanghai; The Mayor Summoned to Nanjing to Report; Also Visits President Weng; Returns to Shanghai by Train That Night</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, summoned by presidential telegram, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Shanghai at approximately 9:00 AM on the 4th and returned to Shanghai by overnight train at approximately 11:00 PM that night. Wu met with the President twice in Nanjing, reporting on the prices and economic situation in Shanghai after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Decree, especially providing a very detailed report on the implementation of the recent week's worth of emergency financial and economic measures. After listening to Wu's report, the President provided very detailed instructions on how to implement the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Decree and how to stabilize prices in Shanghai. Wu arrived in Nanjing in the morning of the 4th, resting at No. 18 Guling Road, and reported to the President by telephone. At 1:00 PM, Wu went to the Song Ziwen residence in Beijige to request instructions from the President, leaving after an hour and a half. He then visited Executive Yuan Secretary-General Li Weiguo for 20 minutes. At 3:00 PM, he went to No. 17 Langya Road to visit President Weng Wenhao, talking for half an hour before continuing to visit other friends. Wu had already booked a ticket for the express train at 6:00 PM, planning to return to Shanghai at 6:00 PM. The President telegraphed No. 18 Guling Road to invite Wu for another talk, but Wu had already gone out. He then telegraphed President Weng's residence, but was unable to reach him. He then sent someone to wait at the station. Wu arrived at Xiaguan Station by car at 5:40 PM and was summoned by the President to return to Beijige to visit the President again, finally leaving at approximately 7:00 PM. He then had dinner with friends at Longmen Restaurant before taking a car to Xiaguan Station at approximately 10:00 PM to board the train and leave Nanjing to return to Shanghai. Before Wu left Nanjing, our newspaper reporter interviewed Wu in the Nanjing-Shanghai train. Wu was reading a foreign magazine, appearing very relaxed. The reporter first asked about the purpose of his visit to Nanjing. Wu said that he had been summoned by presidential telegram last night to report to the President on the economic situation in Shanghai and the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Decree. The reporter asked whether the rumor that the Mayor had come to Nanjing to resign was true, and told him that the outside world was saying this definitively. Wu repeatedly said, "Not true, not true." Wu said: "I came here upon the President's telegram summons. In addition to asking questions, the President also gave many instructions, but none of them are for publication. Although I have resigned several times in the past, now is really not the time to resign." The reporter asked again what instructions the President had given regarding the recent implementation of financial and economic measures in Shanghai. Wu smiled and replied that he could not disclose them. When asked if the President had sent a letter to Chiang Ching-kuo, Wu replied no. The reporter repeatedly asked for his opinion on the arrest of major merchants in Shanghai, but Wu avoided answering. Although Wu was very relaxed during the conversation, he was very cautious in his statements, frequently saying that the President hoped that the work of changing land registration in Shanghai would be completed quickly.</p>
<h3>Applications to Revise Price Limits Will Not Be Considered by the Authorities; Decision Made at the Price Review Committee Meeting</h3>

Mayor Wu was unable to attend due to his visit to Nanjing on official business. Chairman Yu Hongjun first announced that the committee's work scope was to communicate the central and local price policies. The review of various prices in the city would be drafted by the relevant authorities in accordance with the principles set by the committee and then reviewed by the review committee. After Yu's report, the current price limit policy was discussed. It was generally agreed that the government's implementation of price limits was originally intended to break the price increase psychology of merchants in the city, so at this moment, applications to revise price limits would not be considered. However, the price of gasoline for private cars is proposed to be increased to show that prohibition is implicit in the increase, advocating for conservation.</p>
<h3>Planning to Use Government Materials</h3>
<p>Another report: The economic management authorities are actively planning to use materials controlled by government agencies to maintain the "819" price limits.

At the same time, the Vice President of the Central Bank also met with Shen Zhennan, manager of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, to discuss in detail the use of Taiwan Sugar resources.</p>
<h3>Severe Punishment for Speculation and Refusal to Sell</h3>
<p>Those around Chiang Ching-kuo said: The authorities are determined to maintain the 18th and 9th price limits. In the future, merchants who speculate and refuse to sell goods will be severely punished. The merchants detained the previous day had been secretly reported and investigated in advance. After there was sufficient evidence, the supervisory office sent a letter to the municipal government to detain them and handle them according to law. The supervisory office has no power of arrest. The results of the future investigation will be reported by the responsible agency to the office for record.</p>

It is also requested that the government issue a clear order for everyone to abide by it from top to bottom. (3) In order to conserve foreign exchange and reduce gasoline consumption, it is proposed that the government strictly crack down on the possession of cars without necessary official business, revoke their licenses, and reduce the number of cars driven by existing agencies to value public funds.

<h3>District Labor Unions Reorganized into Factory Labor Unions with Two New Principles Established</h3>

It is reported that more than forty district labor union organizations in this city have been abolished one after another and have been reorganized into factory labor unions. Now, the Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to suit the actual situation in this city, has revised the two principles for organizing factory labor unions: (1) If a factory has more than 300 workers, and the workers of the factory apply or the competent authorities deem it necessary; (2) Factories that have already joined the Municipal Labor Union may not withdraw and establish factory labor unions independently. It is reported that these regulations will be implemented from September of this year and have been ordered to be notified to the labor unions of various industries by the Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>

<h3>Funeral Parlors Increase Prices; Truly Disregarding the Living and the Dead, Citizens Report and Request Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Citizen Wang Xinghuan submitted reports to Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, the City Council, and the Economic Inspection Team of the Police Department yesterday, reporting that the Shanghai Funeral Parlor on Xujiahui Road took advantage of the currency reform to drastically increase the storage fees of the parlor, and requested a swift and thorough investigation and an order to restore the original prices of "August 19th". According to the original report: The storage in the parlor is divided into three grades: A, B, and C. In June, Grade A was 1.5 million Legal Tender, and Grade B was 1 million Legal Tender. In July, it was raised to 3.2 million Legal Tender for Grade A and 2.8 million Legal Tender for Grade B. In early and mid-August, it was further raised to 10 million Legal Tender for Grade A and 8 million Legal Tender for Grade B. After the currency reform in late August, it was changed to 10 Gold Yuan for Grade A and 8 Gold Yuan for Grade B. In just three months, the price has been raised four times, increasing by 20 to 24 times, which is truly shocking. In chaotic times, it is difficult for ordinary people to live and die. It is not easy for the living to reside in Chang'an.</p>
<h3>Upright and Impartial; Three Supervisory Committee Members Encourage Themselves with Four Characters; Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Office Holds First Reception for Reporters</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Office held its first press conference since its establishment at 5:00 PM yesterday. Supervisory Committee member Tao Baichu introduced the heads of the Supervisory Office, Yu Peihou, Qing Shen’an, and Ni Bi, to the reporters. First, female Supervisory Committee member Yu Peihou delivered a speech: Supervisory work is based on public opinion. The Supervisory Yuan, people's representatives, and the media share the same mission. If the three parties are united on the basis of impartiality, abandon personal grievances, distinguish right from wrong, and eliminate evil and promote good, then the eradication of corruption is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Willing to be the People's Vanguard</p>
<p>Currently, people generally criticize that "the country has no discipline, and society has no distinction between right and wrong," which has created a world where opportunists thrive, and virtuous and wise people retreat and hide. In the future, this trend must be reversed for the success of national construction. Supervisory Committee member Qing Shen’an said in his speech: The establishment of this Supervisory Office coincides with the currency reform and the implementation of emergency economic measures. The Supervisory Office bears a great responsibility. After the implementation of the Constitution, the Supervisory Committee members are representatives of the people. In the future, our work will be based on the will of the people, and we hope that the media will provide more assistance. We are willing to be the vanguard, challenging corrupt officials, local bullies, and unscrupulous elements to fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the people.</p>
<p>Eradicate Unscrupulous Officials</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi said in his speech: The Communists are currently using a conciliatory policy, which is extremely harmful. The reason why the Communists adopted this policy is to target the corruption of government officials and political corruption, so eradicating corruption will lead to the self-destruction of the Communists. The so-called "powerful families" are also unscrupulous officials in the government and should also be included in the eradication. Before we came to Shanghai, we already knew that Shanghai was a "tiger's den," but "how can you catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" Whether we will catch the tiger or be swallowed by the tiger depends entirely on the support of the people. Finally, he put forward the four characters "Upright, Just, Honest, and Bright" to encourage himself. After the three Supervisory Committee members finished their speeches, reporters asked questions one after another, which were answered by the three members. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes in the Leather Industry and Others; Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Based on Reports</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the currency reform, the wages of employees in various industries in this city have been determined by the central government and paid in Gold Yuan according to Article 22 of the Regulations for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Economic Control. The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee of this city has also formulated four wage standards for various factories and businesses to follow. However, due to past practices, there are still disputes between labor and management in some factories and businesses in this city. The Social Affairs Bureau is trying to mediate, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Leather Shoe Industry: Yang Fusheng, Chairman of the Shoe Business Association, went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to report the difficulty in calculating wages. Because the workers insisted on requiring that the base salary per pair of leather shoes be multiplied by the cost of living index of the upper period of August to be paid in Gold Yuan, while the employers believed that the marked prices of leather shoes in each store must comply with the prices on August 19th, and the wages should also be calculated based on the cost of living index of the lower period of July. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the employers to maintain their businesses. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting on the 6th to discuss with both labor and management.</p>
<p>(2) Western Clothing Industry: The Western Clothing Industry Labor Union submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday regarding the issue of wage calculation, proposing five requirements: (1) The base salary of employees in the industry was 2 yuan and 15 cents in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Now, they request that each silver dollar be converted into 2 yuan of Gold Yuan according to regulations, which translates to a base salary of 4 yuan and 30 cents. (2) The wage should be calculated by multiplying the cost of living index announced for the first half of August by the base salary, and then converted into Gold Yuan as the standard. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a mediation on the 6th.</p>
<p>(3) Needle Manufacturing Industry: The Association submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that the industry had signed a record with the Labor Union of Hosiery Needle Industry in July, stipulating that workers' wages should be paid according to the cost of living index of the previous month. The industry requested that it continue to follow the original method, using the cost of living index of the lower period of July and then converting it into Gold Yuan, in order to maintain the survival of dozens of businesses.</p>
<h3>Father's Day Promotion Committee Allocates Large Sum to Promote Scholarships</h3>
<p>The Father's Day Promotion Committee of this city sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "Our Association held a special broadcast on Father's Day on August 8th at the Shanghai Radio Station to raise scholarship funds for poor students, raising a total of 10,366,600,000 yuan of Legal Tender, with interest income of 1,407,680,000 yuan. After deducting necessary expenses, there is a total of 11,098,550,000 yuan. Half of this amount will be donated to the Shanghai Scholarship Fund and the Linglian Association's elementary school. The remaining half, totaling 5,509,275,000 yuan, will be allocated to your newspaper's reader scholarship fund. Enclosed is a check. Please acknowledge receipt..." Since the start of fundraising for the current reader scholarship fund on July 1st of this year, donations have not been very enthusiastic. Thanks to the Father's Day Promotion Committee's broadcast fundraising and allocation of a large sum of money, the expected goal was quickly achieved, which is truly a blessing for poor students in this city. The members of the Father's Day Promotion Committee worked tirelessly to raise scholarship funds, running around and appealing in the summer heat, and achieved satisfactory results. In addition to receiving the funds, this newspaper would like to express its highest gratitude on behalf of countless poor students.</p>

<h3>50 Yuan Denomination Banknote: Where Did It Come From If It Was Never Issued? Someone Attempted to Exchange It at the National Bank; Sent to the Police Bureau for Strict Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, said: As reported in last night's newspaper, the Central Bank discovered that a person named Jiang Futai inquired at the bank whether a 50-yuan Legal Tender banknote (with a portrait of the Prime Minister in the center) that had not yet been issued could be exchanged for Gold Yuan. The bank personnel believed that since this type of 50-yuan Legal Tender banknote had never been issued in the past, how could it be circulating in the market? It must be the case that a small number of banknotes were stolen from the ship that transported the batch of banknotes from the United States to Shanghai via India in September of the 34th year of the Republic (1945). The case has been sent to the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau for strict investigation. In short, the portrait on the 5-yuan Gold Yuan banknote is the late Chairman Lin, the 100-yuan banknote has both a portrait of President Chiang and a portrait of the late Chairman Lin, and the other 1-yuan, 10-yuan, and 50-yuan banknotes all have portraits of President Chiang, which are easy to distinguish.</p>

<h3>Workers of Datong Printing Factory Report Dismissal Dispute</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, workers from the No. 1 and No. 2 printing factories of Datong Bookstore hosted news reporters at the Datong Tea House to report on the dismissal dispute that occurred after the government reformed the currency system and stopped printing Legal Tender. According to reports, the factory's handling methods are: (1) About 200 people will be retained out of more than 900 people. (2) Dismissal compensation will be paid according to the regulations of the Bureau of Social Affairs, ranging from three months to half a month's salary for each dismissed worker. The workers' opinions are: (1) In addition to printing banknotes, Datong Printing Bureau also has other printing businesses. The number of workers retained should be increased to more than half. (2) The wages of banknote printing workers are usually meager and the work is heavy, so the dismissal compensation should be paid more generously. After repeated negotiations between labor and management, the factory only agreed to add five days of salary to each person in addition to the dismissal compensation. The workers have separately sent letters to the former General Manager Tao Baichuan and the current Chairman Du Yuesheng requesting help. It is reported that Tao has scheduled to meet with the workers at 10:00 AM today to discuss the matter, and there may be a better solution.</p>

<h3>Ruthless Armed Smuggling of Taiwanese Grain</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Wu Shourin</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch on the 11th] The Taiwanese food policy is the greatest force in ensuring stability in Taiwan, where few people need to worry about their daily meals. However, precisely because the price of grain in Taiwan differs so greatly from the mainland, it has become a shortcut for risk-takers to get rich. Economic principles tell us to "exploit the land's resources" and "facilitate exchange of surpluses and shortages." Taiwan has fully achieved the former, but the latter has been shouldered solely by the government. Why? Because the famine on the mainland is too severe and widespread. If "facilitating exchange" were to become an unorganized, uncounted, and unrestricted activity, then even exhausting Taiwan's entire grain production would not be able to alleviate the mainland's starvation. It would inevitably lead to the joke of "failing to save the tadpoles but starving the snakes." The Taiwanese provincial government understands this mutually exclusive situation, and therefore has blocked private channels for exporting grain. However, where there is profit, who would not want to seize it? Especially since adventurers have their own methods.</p>
<p>Looking coldly at the rampant grain smuggling in Shanghai in recent months, it truly involves clever plundering and forceful seizure, using both soft and hard tactics. The scale varies, and the number of occurrences is countless. The thoroughness of the planning and the boldness of the operations are truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Late at night on June 2nd, Sun Cailiang, a police officer from the Taichung County Police Bureau, led several officers in secretly exporting 154 bags of rice from Lukang. Unfortunately, they were discovered by Zheng Zhenxian, a police officer at the Lukang police station. Even more unfortunate was that this officer, although of low rank, was a tough man. As a result, he was not intimidated by the other party's police officer status and confiscated all the smuggled rice, handing it over to a local resident named Zhan Zhang for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, late at night on the 3rd, Sun Cailiang led a group of people armed to the teeth, making a comeback. They also transported more than 200 bags of rice, threatening Zhan Zhang to rob the 154 bags of rice that had been confiscated, making a total of more than 400 bags, and blatantly smuggled it away.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "paper cannot contain fire." Although the grain was spirited away under the cover of weapons, word also spread. The journalistic circles in Taichung felt that it was outrageous for those responsible for suppressing smuggling to be engaged in armed smuggling. Therefore, upholding a sense of justice, they beat the drum and attacked, causing the matter to escalate. Gong Luduan, the magistrate of Taichung County, felt that he could no longer play the role of "a blind old man" and ordered Chen Ding, the chief of the county police bureau, to investigate and report. However, Chen's response was unexpected, simply concluding that "no such incident was found." Unfortunately, the journalistic circles were too nosy, and the new offensive spread to the newspapers in the provincial capital. Xu Zhenxiang, a special commissioner of the Provincial Police Department, together with County Magistrate Gong, personally went to Lukang to investigate and found that the evidence was conclusive. They immediately transferred all the suspects to the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. This case should have come to an end under the pronouncement of "handled according to the law." Unfortunately, it was another case of "hot money in a cold pot." The Taichung County Journalists Association suddenly issued a telegram on August 30th, stating that the suspects in the case had recently been released by the court under the ruling of "insufficient evidence." However, they believed that the evidence was very sufficient and should not have been released. They also said that Sun Cailiang was an ordinary civil servant, who would not have the huge sums of money to purchase grain for smuggling and profiteering, nor would he have the courage to openly lead a group of people in armed smuggling. They determined that there must be a mastermind behind the scenes. They wanted to question Chen Ding, the chief of the Taichung Police Bureau, why he tried to cover up the case at the beginning, claiming that "no such incident was found"?</p>
<p>Now this telegram full of gunpowder is out, and all agencies and newspapers in the provincial capital have received it. However, it is hard to say what results can be achieved by "scholars discussing war on paper." According to our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on August 28th, the Ministry of Food has already been paying attention to the smuggling of Taiwanese grain. We sincerely hope that the central government's concern will prompt the local authorities to pay attention. At the same time, to take a step back, smuggling to mainland ports can still be considered as the benefits not leaking out. However, the reporter is very worried that grain ships will sail to foreign countries only a sea apart.</p>
<h3>Developing Zhejiang Province's Resources: Establishing a Mineral Resources Survey Team</h3>

<h3>Central Committee Member Dai Chuanxian and Others Plan to Rebuild Jinshan Temple</h3>
<p>Establish a Committee to Raise Funds</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 4th] Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang was previously destroyed by fire, resulting in significant losses. It is difficult to restore its former appearance in a short period of time.

<h3>Former Director of Hunan Province's Land and Food Department Exposed for Accumulating Arrears of Grain Tax</h3>
<p>Huang Dean's Statement on Grain Deficiencies</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 4th] Since Jiang Gu took over the Hunan Provincial Land and Food Department, he has discovered that the previous director had accumulated huge arrears of grain tax and military provisions, with rumors claiming the amount to be over one million shi. The previous director, Huang Dean, issued a special statement regarding this: (1) The grain deficiencies in various counties are mostly accumulated over the years and not the result of a sudden event. In the past, the central military provisions were never fully transported, and new and old taxes were intertwined, making it difficult to detect. There were also many disputes this year. The central government's urging was very strong, so the matter of grain deficiencies was not discovered in many cases. (2) Recently, the counties owed more than 700,000 shi of military provisions, scattered in remote areas, and the initial collection and transportation had not yet been carried out. Among these untransported provisions, there may be some misappropriation, but it is definitely not the entire amount. (3) As for the 700,000 shi owed, it was for the central government's grain purchases. The province's Purchasing Committee purchased a total of 332,127 large bags of rice and 419,179 shi of grain. 323,214 large bags of rice and 384,263 shi of grain have been delivered. 3,913 large bags of rice and 34,916 shi of grain are owed and awaiting transport. In addition, the Guangdong Provincial Government previously purchased 100,000 shi of provincial-level grain, and the grain funds were directly handed over to the Finance Department for transportation and purchase, and distributed to various counties. The Provincial Land and Food Department is responsible for urging the counties to transport and allocate the grain. This grain is also scattered in remote areas, making it difficult to concentrate, especially since local people oppose transporting grain to relieve famine. Moreover, there were many disputes over transportation, so it has not yet been fully delivered.</p>

<h3>Changzhou Self-Defense Team Squad Leader Ye Changshu Beat Station Clerk to Death with Gun Butt Over Mistress's Unpaid Fare; District Attorney's Office Confirmed Crime and Took Suspect into Custody</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch on the 4th] Ye Changshu, the squad leader of the self-defense team stationed in Wansui, had his mistress, along with two female friends, purchase New Gate tickets from Datong Motor Company in the city at the end of last month. They rode beyond their station to Shiqiao Town, where they were discovered by station clerk Gao Changlin, who ordered them to pay the additional fare. The woman, harboring resentment, complained to Ye Changshu, who then led a squad of team members directly to Shiqiao the next day.

<h3>Yarn Prices Hovering at Limits</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was stable yesterday. At the opening, the Textile Construction Corporation had not yet posted its prices. It was late, around 12 o'clock, when the Textile Construction Corporation posted its prices for sale, and the Six District Associations handled joint distribution. Yarn factories each sold separately in the store front and supplied sufficient yarns which calmed the nerves within the market. As the money market was still loose, there were still sporadic demands from all sides. The asking price was revolving at the limit price. General owners, aware of the sluggish market sentiment, sold off their stocks in order to make way, which formed a situation of clarity that was in reality not so firm. A total of 133 bales were traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>Also learned: The Textile Construction Corporation posted prices around noon, selling 20-count Red Man Bell, Sailing Boat, and Red Bee at a uniform price of 707 yuan.</p>

<h3>First Batch of US Aid Cotton Allocation Quantity Determined</h3>

Formal contracts can be signed with the factories next week. The China Trust Bureau has completed the customs clearance procedures for this batch of cotton and has limited it to five days.</p>
<p>Regarding the ports of delivery for US aid cotton and yarn cloth, it is rumored that the last Cotton Group meeting rejected the request from inland factories to increase the number of ports.</p>
<h3>Price Sticking to Original Disk, Rice Transactions Rare, Flour Falls Back, Oil Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>The rice market is sticking to the limited price, but transactions are becoming increasingly scarce. The price of rice from rice producing areas is relatively high. If sold at the limited price there may be a loss, and therefore owners were not willing to sell. The scarcity in the supply is also due to the limited prices. Japonica rice in particular is rare. The available samples on the vendors' tables were few. There were more transactions for Indica rice, and the price also remained at the limit. High quality coarse Indica rice was sold for seventeen yuan per bag. Jiangxi polished rice was also opened with slight openings. A total of 4,892 shi arrived in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour saw a slight decline, as holders rush to offload the stocks because the deadline of the warehouse receipts was approaching. Increased supplies were absorbed and the transaction was brisk. Closing price of old Che brand powder fell to seven yuan and three jiao five fen from seven yuan and four jiao; a drop of one jiao and five fen. Bingshun [Boat] powder closed five cents lower, Red Bee lost five fen, and various brands were reduced by one jiao and one jiao and five fen. Bran is still sold at the limit price, and wheat remains at ten yuan and three fen.</p>
<p>Transactions for coarse grains were sparse. Prices of soy beans was inversely related to the prices in the producing areas, so it was rarely sold. Two hundred packages of Douchi were traded. Corn and corn products from the north are sluggish and the price fell by two jiao. Red grain prices are low. The customer's help picked up and the market became firmer. There were few transactions for Yuan wheat, and broad beans were supplied at the limit price. There was limited amount of mung beans opening, and one hundred packages of sesame seeds were supplied by vendors, with each household on this street receiving one package. Supplies of raw peanuts were low and transactions were sparse and sold at five hundred thousand per unit. (Kaifeng raw peanuts traded for two to three hundred packages.</p>
<p>Edible oil was sluggish. At the opening, oil factories planned to supply in large quantities at the limited price. Hearing the news, scattered households released the hold, and they were swift in removing the stocks before the limited price was enforced. The factory did not open its sales in the end. China Planting Factory [Zhongzhi chang] had some sales for raw vegetable oil with 20 packages at the limit prices. More stocks from Huilong were released. Soybean oil initially opened at fifty-one yuan and five jiao, closing at fifty-one yuan. Raw vegetable oil closed at forty-six yuan with each down by one yuan. Crude oil dropped slightly by one jiao, while the Old Bucket Xiao Che oil did not open but called the old prices to no avail. Stockings of soybean cakes were low. Dasheng Yuan Factory opened two thousand pieces of Dayuan cake at the limit price, and Datong and Yiji also sold.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>After the silk market surged to the limit price, transactions in the market have almost stopped. Generally, holders of warehouse receipts are unable to move, so they extract the goods from the factory. The storefront and shops sold at a limited price. Actual sales were very strong, and they all tried to supplement the stocks from various factories. The factories are limited in the quantities they sell. Each household is allowed to purchase one piece.</p>
<p>Since August 19th, there has been little trading in white newsprint, and it is not easy to purchase, especially No. 2 paper and Daolin paper, which are even rarer. It is said that paper shops only allow the purchase of 50 sheets of newspaper per time, and the purchaser (such as printing houses) must provide a letter. The prices of industrial raw materials are limited, and fewer people are coming to the market. The sales have decreased because actual demands have been reduced from many factories.</p>
<p>The production of new red jujubes and Chinese wolfberries [Gouqi] from Ningxia has decreased greatly. Two batches that arrived were not saleable and the asking prices fell and nobody was buying them. Codonopsis pilosula [Dangshen] and Sichuan lovage [Chuanxiong] prices have stopped growing and are limited.</p>
<p>Regarding the raw materials for the copper and tin industry, such as copper blocks, tin blocks, lead, zinc, and aluminum, the "August 19th" market prices have been reviewed by the association and submitted to the Social Bureau for approval. The manufactured products, such as copper sheets, copper pipes, and copper wires, will be jointly reported by the copper factories.</p>
<h3>Unfair Distribution of Gasoline, Guidance Office Asks for Correction</h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office requested an increase in the gasoline quota for domestic machinery factories. The Ministry of Land and Commerce allowed to increase quota of oil for industrial use after the investigation. It was discovered that the gasoline quota allocated by the Oil Allocation Association was extremely unfair. The original text stated: "In order to increase the gasoline quota for various domestic machinery factories, save factories from shutting down, and prevent workers from becoming unemployed, and prevent the occurrence of serious consequences after the severe city closures, the Petroleum Allocation Committee is requested to increase the gasoline quota to maintain the crisis of the national industrial clan. Since the establishment of the Gasoline Allocation Committee, the control of various uses has not only failed to meet demand, but the allocation has also been quite unfair. The association allocated 1.25 million gallons for general use, while the factories only received 250,000 gallons, including the fuel for civil aviation. The allotment is so overly harsh and unfair that a panic has arisen throughout the city's industry. For example, the rubber industry must use gasoline as a solvent and binder. It is one of the main raw materials for rubber, with a planned quota of 100,000 gallons, which is less than half of the actual demand. If it is not improved, the power of various factories will inevitably be forced to shut down. If the factory stops, there will be tens of thousands of unemployed workers, and the subsequent shadow effects will be disastrous. Rubber is a key industry designated by the government, which not only to essential for civil daily necessities but is also used in tire heavy-duty tires, military for aircraft. Other industries also have their key industrial uses. Gasoline for transportation can be replaced by domestic alcohol, or used together. Gasoline in industry cannot be replaced. In short, the control distribution should first understand the inside story of each industry, and then weigh the pros and cons and proceed. Now the control is only implemented in Shanghai, while other ports are allowed to be as before. In fact, it is useless, and there are many problems. To save the serious crisis of unemployment of the vast majority of workers in this city, we plan to request the Shanghai Gasoline Allocation Committee to re-examine and divide the quantity, increase the allocation of industrial oil, reduce the gasoline used by private individuals, or order the use of blended domestic alcohol. Also should limit vehicles without licenses, and disallow fueling in the city. These are a small hope of savings from the shutdown of industries due to the petroleum limits. The textile factories were limited to Shanghai. Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and foreign ships can reach the four ports. Inland yarn factories and flower yarn cloth must bear their own transportation costs to the port of delivery. The ratio of domestic and export sales of yarn is planned by the management office and is not divided within the quota paid by each factory.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Footing is Solid</h3>
<p>Domestic tea yesterday had balanced incoming and outgoing quantities, remaining without much fluctuation. As for foreign firms' tea market, the trend shows an expanding brilliance, largely because the responsible parties sense that the demand for Chinese tea abroad is very high, and prices are also frequently improving. This optimistic attitude is further strengthened, and the market atmosphere is thriving, with a footing that can be called solid.</p>
<p>According to informed sources: Since our government imposed price restrictions on export goods, it is said that recently in the international market, not only tea is gradually rising, but also tung oil, raw silk, furs, and other commodities are showing signs of improvement. If this continues, the domestic economy can be stabilized, and at the same time, more foreign exchange can be earned, consolidating the currency system.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Resolution Sent to Central Bank for Implementation: Regulations for Self-Funded Study Abroad Exchange; Minimum US$2,400 Required for Departure; Allotment of $100,000 to Assist Impoverished Students to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Regarding how self-funded students studying abroad can purchase foreign exchange after the currency reform, it is reported that the Central Bank has received instructions from the Executive Yuan, stating: Upon review of the Ministry of Education's proposal: due to the currency reform, self-funded students are unable to purchase foreign exchange and request assistance.

<h3>Former President of Hubei Normal College Disqualified from Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] According to information from the Ministry of Education: After the disturbances at Hubei Normal College, the Ministry of Education attached great importance to the details of the disturbances.

The conference was divided into five subgroups, and the Chinese representatives participated in three groups to discuss university standards, university funding, and international cooperation among universities. Finally, a temporary committee of ten members was established, with representatives from China and India among the members. The committee will prepare two matters: (1) Establishing an international organization or association of universities, with membership based on universities and specialized schools of equivalent status, rather than countries. (2) Establishing an international university exchange bureau, with the aim of collecting and disseminating information about universities around the world, compiling educational statistics and publishing yearbooks, collecting books about universities, researching certain issues related to universities, and promoting international exchanges of students and faculty. The bureau may be established as soon as possible and will be temporarily located at the headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), with funding also provided by the organization.</p>

<h3>Aid-the-Students Basketball First Day: Transportation Auto and Morning Friends; Shanghai Team Wins Over Warrior by Three Points; Tonight Transportation Auto Faces Dagong</h3>
<p>The basketball charity tournament organized by the Municipal Education Bureau to raise scholarship funds for needy students held its first day yesterday, with two games scheduled. The games began at 7 p.m. at the Municipal Gymnasium. The weather was hot, and the seats were sparsely filled. Ticket sales totaled just over 200 gold yuan. In the first game, the Shanghai team competed against the Warrior team. Director Li of the Education Bureau tossed the opening ball. As a result, the Shanghai team narrowly defeated the Warrior team 39-36. In the second game, Morning Friends played Transportation Auto. The two sides battled fiercely, ending in a 41-41 tie at the final buzzer.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Wins by Three Points</p>
<p>At 7 p.m. sharp, the Shanghai team and the Warrior team took the court. After Director Li tossed the opening ball, the two teams made contact. Zhi Ji of the Warrior team made the first basket, followed by a free throw from Li De and then Wei Cong. The two sides battled for a long time, scoring only on free throws. After 7-7, Li De of the Shanghai team made two baskets from the center circle, leading 12-7. The Warrior team chased hard, but the Shanghai team's captain was unable to hold them off. The Warrior team seized the opportunity to break through, tying the score at 18-18. The first half ended with each team scoring 20 points. After switching sides, it was still difficult to determine who would take the lead, and the score was tied again at 24-24. Zhi Ji made a long shot, and Wei Xu followed with a basket, giving the Warrior team a 29-24 lead. Qing Jiang of the Shanghai team came on, and the two sides entered a chaotic situation, with frequent fouls. At 32-31, the Shanghai team was still one point behind. Zhang Pu made a shot, and Yan Wei broke through, tying the score at 34-34, making the game tense. Shortly after, Ma Canxi broke through the crowd to score a goal, 36-34, giving the Shanghai team the lead. As time ran out, the Shanghai team narrowly won 39-36.</p>

<h3>Open Tennis Senior Singles; Ye Guanxiong and Wang Wenzheng to Compete for Final Spot Today; Tao Guanqiu Defeats Cai Guoheng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Open Tennis Men's and Women's Singles Quarter-Finals were held yesterday. The Men's group had new outstanding talent Cai Guoheng face the City's reigning champion, Tao Guanqiu; and in the Women's group, Tianjin champion Dian Ai-yu faced National Games Champion Yang Weibin. The iron grid was filled with hope for those new talents, so the youth tennis had five to six hundred people. As a result of the fierce battle, Tao Guanqiu and Yang Weibin were determined to be the older masters, while Cai Guoheng and Lei Aiyu reported their defeat. Lei was on another level, at the mercy of Yang Weibin. It's such an aberration that she only got three games in the two sets. Cai Guoheng is the Nanjing representative for the National Games. He's rich in strength and a promising talent. His powerful strokes are amazing. Tao was repeatedly embarrassed, but his hitting was not stable, and his net skills were not yet up to par. There was no way to support him after he entered. Tao Guanqiu was stable and remained normal. The competition was still exciting. The results of the two groups are as follows:</p>

<h3>English, Math, and Chinese</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>English, mathematics, and Chinese are commonly listed as important subjects. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese proficiency of general students has gradually declined. Previously in Fujian, when examining new students' Chinese papers, I always felt that they were not up to par; I thought it was because I was used to seeing papers of higher cultural standards, which were in math. Since returning to the province, I have reviewed entrance examination papers for Chinese four or five times, and I have come to realize that Chinese proficiency has generally declined. In order to improve Chinese proficiency, the Ministry of Education once issued a notice stating that students who fail Chinese cannot be promoted, cannot graduate, and cannot be admitted to entrance examinations. According to pre-war standards, there are very few Chinese papers that are acceptable now. After opening schools, you have to enroll students, so you can only lower the standards or relax the grading, so that they formally comply with the law, but in reality, Chinese proficiency has not improved.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Senior High School entrance examination papers are always sealed; Chinese papers are routinely divided into sections for grading, one person specializes in interpreting, one person specializes in translating, and one person specializes in writing. This time, the writing section that I looked at was at the end, so I had to summarize the scores. I remember very clearly that out of more than 1,300 papers, only one scored 87 points, followed by 81 points, and then 80 points; only three were in the A range, and the rest scored no more than 79 points, and there was only one of those. Most of them scored less than 60 points, and there were several that scored less than 10 points.</p>
<p>To avoid personal relationships, I looked at the sealed areas, and there was only one code number. So the officials who registered and calculated the scores only knew what number the first place was, and what number the second place was, but they didn't know the names of the people who were admitted. When the admissions committee opened, the director of the Department of Education called out the number of the first place, and another official looked it up and reported who it was, and where they graduated from. The ranking is calculated based on the overall score. English, mathematics, and other subjects only need to not be zero, but Chinese must meet the standard; so another official immediately looked it up and reported the Chinese score. This time, 150 people were admitted, and I never left the venue. I heard very clearly that the student with the highest Chinese score of 87 was not reported and actually failed; the student with the second highest score of 80 was also not admitted. The student with the third highest score of 80 was admitted, but his ranking was not high. The Chinese scores of the top three students were not high. It is obvious that, in an invisible way, it is shown that students who are good at Chinese are poor at other subjects, and students who are good at science are not good at Chinese either. Chinese and science are difficult to master at the same time, and it is simply a matter of conflicting interests. This is because Chinese is both complicated and difficult, and students have limited energy and time. It is really difficult to do both. In the past, writing an article required ten years of study to be considered "not proficient", otherwise you couldn't even talk about the qualifications of being "not proficient". Now, at the same time, you have to study many subjects, so how easy is it to be proficient!</p>
<p>However, it is still a problem that the Chinese proficiency of those who are admitted to senior high school is not good. In order to pay attention to English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, they cannot concentrate on studying Chinese; in the short three years, Chinese will not improve, and they will still not be proficient after graduation. But this is not a major problem for entering university. Whether or not they are admitted is still mainly based on English and mathematics. This is really a big problem. Needless to say, to make the country rich and strong today, it is necessary to develop science, and the time spent on studying Chinese must be reduced; Chinese must be simplified and improved. However, this is not a question of literary Chinese or vernacular Chinese. Whether it is vernacular Chinese or literary Chinese, only clarity is required, and attention to grammar is all that is needed, which does not take much time. The so-called ten years of study to be considered not proficient is to put many classical idioms in the "article" and praise many ancient books, which requires a long time to study. Therefore, what takes time is in "Chinese studies". Chinese studies are not unnecessary, but if everyone is required to pay attention to them, not only will they not be able to take care of science, but even writing will be difficult to be clear. Middle and higher-level students should be clear in writing, and those who fail should not be allowed to graduate or be admitted. However, the clarity of writing and Chinese studies should not be confused as one thing. For the sake of the general youth, for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, and for the sake of Chinese itself, Chinese and Chinese studies should be divided into two subjects; Chinese is a major subject, and Chinese studies is a major subject only in the humanities. In this way, the practice of admitting those with poor Chinese grades at a high level will not happen again, and those with Chinese scores above 81 will be failed instead. I believe that there are very few people who agree with this view at present, but I am convinced that this needs to be distinguished!</p>
<h3>Selling Books</h3>
<p>— Hongxian</p>
<p>In order to cope with the urgent needs of life, I have recently gone to sell books three times.</p>
<p>The first time went fairly smoothly. I took a collection of famous seals of past dynasties to sell. It was a printed edition from the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty and an antique from my family's collection. Although that sharp-eyed bookseller kept picking on it, saying some amateurish things about it not being the original Yang Seal, he still gave me a considerable price, enough for me to buy eight dou of old rice. So, under the condition of self-consolation, I transferred this famous seal album and brought back a few dou of rice to the home where I was staying.</p>
<p>The second time was very unsuccessful, because I brought a "Han Wen Kao Yi" (Research on the Writings of Han Yu). This Han Changli, who started the decline of literature in the Eight Dynasties, was not valued by booksellers. I ran to several old bookstore shops, but none of them were willing to buy it even at the price of waste paper. Moreover, the bookseller sincerely explained to me that this kind of ancient article does not sell as well as an ordinary novel. I also admitted that what he said was right, because nowadays, people who read articles are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, but popular novels really spread like wildfire. So I decided to put this ancient text away and sell it again when someone promotes Han Yu's writing style.</p>
<p>The third time was also unusually unsuccessful, although I brought two romances by Li Yu and a "Huang Mei Story". But these novels and dramas also seemed to be out of date. In the eyes of the bookseller, these bamboo paper woodcut editions were particularly despised. Although they had been preserved for decades, they were indeed not as strong as newspaper paper. So I brought them back again under the bookstore's low valuation. Because if two ci and qu cannot even be exchanged for a few cigarettes, then why not keep the famous aphorisms to play with and chew over?</p>
<p>After the third time, I stopped thinking about selling books.</p>
<h3>I Want to be an Official</h3>
<p>— Kang Jun</p>
<p>After reading the article "I Want to be a Teacher" written by Yi Jun in the Free Talk section on the 31st, I had a strange feeling in my heart. He is willing to be a teacher, but I want to be an "official." I studied politics in university, and after graduation, like Yi Jun, I went around hoping to get an official position, but lacking the skills of ingratiation and flattery, I gained nothing. Unexpectedly, through a friend's introduction, I ended up working as a substitute teacher in a middle school, and later became a full-time teacher. I have been a teacher for four years now, and I am still continuing to teach. As Yi Jun said, there is indeed "development," and the principal's praise increases year by year, and the places where the principal can exploit me (teachers focus on teaching, while the principal is only interested in profit and knows how to make money) also increase year by year. The principal gets richer every year, but my income decreases every year (according to the price index and general salaries), and life is becoming more and more difficult. Although entering the education field to be a teacher was not my original intention (quite the opposite of Yi Jun's intention), in today's world where eight out of ten things go wrong, it is difficult to find a job and using what I have learned is hard, which is not just the case for me and Yi Jun! Yi Jun wants to teach but becomes an official, and I want to be an official but become a teacher. If Yi Jun's "official" could be exchanged for my "teacher," wouldn't that be great!</p>
<h3>Confessions of a Thief</h3>
<p>— Qi Feng</p>
<p>Recently, this publication has often discussed thieves, and seeing their theft methods and tricks, which are constantly emerging and changing with each passing day, I find it quite interesting. A certain Western magazine had an article of a thief confessing. He frankly pointed out that most thefts occur due to the negligence of the victims.</p>
<p>He said: Many people like to close the doors, windows, and shutters before leaving the house—especially when going to another place for summer or winter vacation. This is equivalent to clearly telling the thieves: No one lives in this house, please come in with confidence!</p>
<p>Some people are also smart alecks, and in order to make the thieves think that someone is in the house, they deliberately leave the lights on in the bathroom or bedroom when they leave. Little do they know that the thieves are even smarter than them. They must "case" the house in advance during the daytime before stealing. Seeing the lights on during the day and no one in sight, they know that you are trying to create a false impression, and they can come and do their thing leisurely at night.</p>
<p>Some people also like to leave a note in the milk bottle, telling the milkman: when to leave and when to leave this house, temporarily stop sending milk. When the thieves know this, it is another good opportunity.</p>
<p>The social news section and the news of the whereabouts of celebrities in the newspapers are the best intelligence supply sources for thieves. Because they know that once the owner leaves, the servants will inevitably become negligent, and they can take this opportunity to show off their skills. Moreover, most of these families are wealthy and powerful, and the harvest must be considerable!</p>
<p>Most thieves operate late at night. When they have finished "working," they are not in a hurry to escape. If they are in an empty house, they can rest in the house for a while, and after dawn, they can take a few suitcases or bags, dress neatly, and walk out calmly and generously. Others will think they are going to catch the early train!</p>
<p>In a house with people, if they feel that they have been discovered by the owner, they will use the fear of ordinary people to make a kind of mournful and strange sound, so that the timid owner thinks it is a "ghost cry" and dare not get up to catch them; or they will imitate the barking of cats and dogs to dispel the owner's suspicion. Some even dress up as ghosts and monsters to scare people.</p>
<p>An experienced thief doesn't care about alarms, dogs, locks, and all other anti-theft devices. Because stealing is fundamentally an attempt to outsmart and study psychology, their success is by no means accidental!</p>
<h3>On Feng Chaoran's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongdian</p>
<p>The other day, on my way to Beijing, I read Hu Yaguang's "Zhang Zixiang and Feng Chaoran" in this newspaper's Free Talk section and was surprised. Zhang Zixiang's name was Zhang Xiong, alias Yuanhu Waishi, from Xiushui. He was born in the eighth year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty (1803) and died in the twelfth year of Guangxu (1886) at the age of eighty-four. He was skilled in flower painting and also painted landscapes. His calligraphy followed Huang Shangu. He was indeed a famous painter of the Tongguang era. However, Hu Jun's claim that Mr. Feng Chaoran studied under Zixiang is not true, and it is even more absurd and baseless to mistakenly refer to Mr. Chaoran as an apprentice in a barber shop. Mr. Chaoran called himself Shende Jushi, also known as Dige, and named his painting studio Songshan Cottage. He lived in Shanghai, residing on Songshan Road for nearly twenty years. In the winter of Xinyi (1941) in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, his disciples compiled a collection of paintings to celebrate his sixtieth birthday. From this calculation, it can be known that he was only five years old in the twelfth year of Guangxu. How could he be an apprentice? How could he be capable of calligraphy and painting? Mr. Chaoran was from Wujin. He studied poetry in his youth and entered the county school. Later, he devoted himself to painting and traveled with Mr. Fei Longding, studying poetry with Shen Yuezai Mingjing. Fei liked bronze and stone inscriptions, while Feng liked painting. He began to travel to Jin at a young age. In the thirty-third year of Guangxu (1907), he traveled to the capital for a long time, and his knowledge and experience became more extensive, and his attainments deepened. He also resolutely refused the employment of powerful figures and returned to Wumen. From then on, his paintings became more valued by the world. At the turn of Guangxu and Xuantong, he moved to Shanghai. On good days in spring and autumn, he often visited Li Pingshu, Wu Changshuo, and others to comment on calligraphy and painting. His intention was to hide himself through painting. In addition to landscapes, Mr. Chaoran's paintings of figures and flowers are not unskilled. He can take the excellent works of the Four Wangs and promote and develop them. He followed the orthodoxy of Dong Yuan and Ju Ran and merged the Northern and Southern schools into one. Di Pingzi and Pang Xuzhai were both connoisseurs, which is well known, and they both highly praised Mr. Chaoran's paintings. Therefore, Hu Jun's work is not worth a smile from those who know art.</p>
<h3>Skin</h3>
<p>According to the Ping City Daily, a Shanghai financial circle dispatch reported that someone's check was rejected because the word "yuan" (圓) was written as "yuan" (元) when paying with gold yuan coupons. He inquired with the bank's business bureau, and Director Li explained that although there is no explicit regulation, since the currency system decree is for gold yuan and not gold yuan, the word "yuan" must be written in order to be valid. This matter is very interesting and humorous, and can be used as a small interlude in many heated programs such as major reforms and major discussions.</p>
<p>In the past, disputes over checks were nothing more than: (1) discrepancies in the amount, such as overdrafts exceeding the balance without overdraft arrangements; (2) unclear amounts, such as careless and simple writing with traces of alteration; (3) inconsistent seals, or blurred seal colors, which were rejected or required to be re-issued for the sake of preventing fraudulent claims. This is reasonable. The reason why numbers must be written in "uppercase" is also because there are more strokes, making them less susceptible to alteration. Adding a "zheng" (正) character at the end has the same effect as "Only" after the number on Western checks to prevent fraud. However, it is rare for problems to arise between "yuan" (圓) and "yuan" (元).</p>
<p>The character "yuan" (圓) not only conforms to its original meaning, but also has more strokes. If it involves the entry and exit of funds, it is appropriate to write a few more strokes. The so-called conforming to its original meaning is because coins are originally "round" in shape, whether they are gold or silver, ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, so the currency system is also called the "yuan method." As for banknotes, they are square (rectangular) pieces of paper, but they are representatives of hard currency, and the original shape of hard currency is still round. Not only is the word "yuan" (圓) written in large characters on this new coupon decree, but it has also been written on all currencies since the creation of new currencies in the early Qing Dynasty. In addition, private records and correspondence use "yuan" (元) instead of "yuan" (圓) simply for convenience, which is fine since it does not involve entry or exit. The details of the check rejected in Shanghai this time are unknown, but it is conceivable that if it were written "Please pay gold yuan coupons for so many yuan, so many jiao, and so many fen," the first "yuan" (元) would clearly separate it from the numerals, and even if you added strokes, you couldn't overdraw a few coins, so there would be no actual liability. The next "yuan" (元) is quite susceptible to altering the numerals (e.g., if you write fifty yuan, if you change the "yuan" (元) to "wan" (萬), you'd make a fortune!). However, it still needs a "yuan" (元) below. Can you add another word below it? In short, it is never easy to make money on the "yuan" (元) character, so those who prevent fraud have never paid attention to this. And those who write checks usually write "yuan" (圓), so-called "be careful, there are no mistakes."</p>
<p>When banknotes were first made in the early Qing Dynasty, the word "yuan" (圓) was written on the front in Chinese, and Dollar was written on the back in Western languages, because only silver was used in the past, and the currency style and manufacturing method were modeled after Europe and the United States in order to resist imported currencies. But later, because the quality of European and American coins was not uniform, and the fineness of "Chinese-made foreign coins" was also slightly different, the transliteration Yuan was used instead. Therefore, the origin of "yuan" (圓) was due to Dollar, and Yuan was its ultimate destination.</p>
<p>The character "yuan" (元) disappeared for a period of time in the early Ming Dynasty because Emperor Taizu of Ming was named "Yuan 　," so he ordered "Yuan Year" to be changed to "Original Year." In the early Qing Dynasty, because Emperor Kangxi was named "Xuan 　," all "Xuanhuang" (玄黃), "Xuanwu" (玄武), etc. were changed to the character "yuan" (元). The character "yuan" (元) became very popular and prevalent in the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<h3>Listening to the Rain at Lake Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>One evening after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the owner of Bai Xie Lou went to Jin Hong to appreciate the moon over Taihu Lake. The garden was at the top of Xiaoji Mountain, with willows lining the embankment. The thick green foliage provided no shelter, and people passed through it as if walking through accumulated bamboo. At sunset, the host was under a rich wisteria trellis, facing several acres of lotus pond. The swaying breeze and swimming fish were all fragrant. There were eighteen white lotuses that bloomed the latest, especially plump and lovely. Each bud was carefully supported by eighteen bamboo poles, and they were as big as basins, truly the best of the white lotuses. Before long, it started to rain, and it didn't stop as evening approached. So, we stayed in the pavilion and drank to our heart's content. The misty lake was covered with white clouds, and the sight of two or three fishing lights was no less enjoyable than seeing the stars and moon. The next day, it was still raining, so we went to Meiyuan in the rain and returned. The companions were the Sanmu couple, Kong Wo's father and son, and Brother Bai Jiao. That night, Wu Man sang passionately and spoke freely, even mentioning anecdotes from the wilderness. All were included in the poem.</p>
<p>The flying wheels carried us to a cool place, with clouds and water rushing around us. After leaving Jiangnan after the new rain, we forgot to return, wrapped in thin blankets.</p>
<p>The duckweed and algae naturally formed patterns on the water. The wind blew through the wisteria trellis, scattering flowing dust. The sound of insects accompanied the wine, letting us know the taste of autumn. The late-blooming white lotus made the rustic people sit.</p>
<p>Closing the pavilion, we sang, forgetting the noise of the night rain, truly like listening to the frost falling under the moon. The full measure of sorrow and anger flowed in our slightly drunken state, as we stole leisure from the chaos and painted the water garden.</p>
<p>The lake shrimp were clean and tender, and the wild rice shoots were sweet. Who would believe that the chaos in the Central Plains has not been quelled? With cold eyes, we looked at the mountains and rivers, and the sparse white hair faced the gnarled beards.</p>
<p>The absurd and overbearing spirit floated to the sky, and the spirits and ghosts proudly stroked their heads. I don't despise Ashu for indulging in dreams, the green forests and incense continue with the fishermen.</p>
<p>The ten thousand willows deeply hid the weak stone bones. The old plum silently delivered the flushed face. Raising our heads, we visually wrote the silent painting, with the Guanshe Mountain connecting to the Xuelang Mountain.</p>
<h3>Registration of Refugees from Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi Five Counties</h3>
