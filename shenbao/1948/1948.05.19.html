<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕行憲第一屆立法院第一會期第一次會議十八日晨舉行。九時四十分，主席孫科院長偕秘書長張肇元於掌聲中就位，主持會議。張氏報告出席委員已足開議法定人數後，孫氏即宣布開會，並致詞略稱：　同人謬愛推信，被選爲院長與各位共負艱鉅，實不勝惶恐激感，至希各位協同勞力，俾不辱使命。旋提出臨時報告，依組織浩據任命張　元氏爲立院秘書長，先行視事，俟總統就職後，即提請正式令派，會衆當於聆悉張氏略歷　，鼓掌歡迎。繼復由張氏宣讀十七日午後選舉副院長投票結果之報告。九時三刻，討論事項開始，　由議事規則起草委員會召集委員樹文，簡單報告起草經過，說明經四次會議及主稿小組之夙夜努力，草案之各章各條均經擬定。惟關於第八章「同意權之行使」終未獲得一致結論，經歸納不同點計四種：「（一）主張認爲必要時得使提出施政及用人意見者，以爲對行政院長行使同意權時，如不提供適當資料，將以何者爲同意與否之標準，殊感困難。行政首重設施，而施政尤在人選，故於行政院長提請同意）時，先使提出施政及用人意見以爲參考，似甚適當。（二）主張施政意見爲憲法第五十七條施政方針之前奏，提供參考，似有必要，至用人應由其自行負責，毋須提出意見者。（三）以爲憲法第五十五條僅有行政院長由總統提名，經立法院同意任命，並無其他規定，主張不必提出施政及用人意見者。（四）主張除不必提出施政及用人意見外，其程序亦毋須經全院委員會審査，逕提本院會議表決者」。並依此四種意見爲第八章擬訂甲，乙，丙，丁四案不同條文（業見十六日本報），提請大會公決。主稿小組召集人陳顧遠繼續提出四要點之說明：（一）議則本身爲該院本身約束，不必經總統公布制成法律，草案擬訂時，已注意不涉及其他機關　憲法所無之　務。至若干委員提出特要案件，須經三分之二出席委員同意、始得通過一點，以須修改組織法暫未規定列入。（二）政治性之權限均已單獨規定，但除質詢權經起草委員會議決確定提出外，同意權共有四種不同條文，尙待大會討論取決。（三）爲尊重民主平等精神，除使會議中院長權限與普通主席之權限相當外，各種動議人數已儘量減少。（四）爲尊重言論自由，發言時間已予伸長，但爲保障全體均有發言機會，不得不對個人發言時間加以相當限制，至十時一刻，孫主席徵得會衆意見　先進行廣泛討論，楊玉淸等九人相繼發言，其中唯簡三曾強調質詢權之重要，反對草案中質詢提出之時期限於報告之後及質詢不得作爲討論之議題兩項規定，並主張建議權及調査權之行使亦應增列，其餘意見均一致集中於第八章，行使同意權時應　先使被提名人提出施政及用人意見，及同盡應否經審査階段或逕行投票　點。起草委員會歷次會議中之至重現於全體會議中，正反兩方陣容均見增強，楊玉淸，簡貫三，王普涵，盧郁文，許蟠雲爲持起草委員會之第（一）種意見贊成甲案者，僉認用人可左右政策、在行使同意權之先有預爲獲知行政院長施政及同人意見之必要，且可爲立院，政院尋求合作基礎，並使總統知所謀得政治之安定，渠等並聲稱，如此主張者，從未要求提出具體名單，僅係一如認爲必要得咨請總統通知所提人提出施政及用人意見，極富彈性，決非違憲之過份要求，陳紹賢，張慶楨持第（二）種意見贊成乙案，認施政意見可提，用人意見不提。朱文德則以依憲法規定，立院旣可以控制院長方式監督其用人，而政院施政方針將於政院成立集議後提出，立院不應於行使同意權之先，要求行政院長提名人提出施政及用人意見。呂復更指出同意意權之行使，應直接投票決定是否，不必經全院委員會審査，耽誤時間，影響政事，聲稱贊同丁案。會議進行中，孔庚曾起稱，廣泛發言內容旣什九爲關於第八章，可先分章逐條討論，至第八章時再儘量發言，然以請求發言者達五十餘人，孔氏意見未　會衆接受，至十二時正孫主席徽詢會衆延長半小時，亦未得同意，主席宣布臨時動議一項，以臨時主席吳鐵城，臨時秘書長樓桐孫主持預備會議，備極辛勞，應予　慰勞案，各委員一致鼓掌通過，即行散會。</p>
<h3>明日下午　繼續開會</h3>
<p>下午三時半續會，出席委員均以要求發言者尙衆，如集中一次廣泛討論，費時過多，一致同意以讀會方式分章逐條進行討論，當即由秘書人員開始朗誦草案全文，四時一讀完畢，繼舉行二讀，草案條文逐條讀出，或無異議通過，或經討論表決後，予以修改，或維持原文，第一章「總則」及第二章「提案」，均順利通過，第三章「議事日程」，黃元彬盧及議事日程如於開會前二日即送達各委員，恐若干重要財經議題不易保守秘密，然經鄧鴻業，雷殷等指出，財經及其他一切關係重大之議題及質詢答覆均可隨時舉行秘密會議，其議事日程自當臨時分送，特殊規定實不宜列入議則，結果第廿條仍維原案。第四章「開會」之第廿四條爲「本院會議於每星期二，星期五開會兩次，必要時得增加會次」，彭醇士主張前半句改爲每星期五開會一次，吳尙鷹則認會期不必爲刻板之規定，提議將前半句修改爲以每週開會一次爲原則·杜光塡·雷股·江一平·張金鑑等當起而反對，堅主會議必須定期，以免通知困難，且可使各委員安排其生活及工作秩序。渠等並強調行憲立院不應貪圖閑散，政權須在會塲中行使，會議次數不應過少，經表決後，仍維原案。第五章「讀會」中，第二讀會部份第卅六條「各委員會審査報告之修正，即作爲議題」以無必要，遭刪去。第六章「討論」，關於發言時間，草案原規定提案之說明質疑或應答之發言，不得逾廿分鐘，討論之發言，不得逾十分鐘，被修改爲說明質疑應答或討論之發言，均不得逾十分鐘。第七章「表決」之最後一條「會議進行中，出席委員對於在塲人數提出疑問，經査點不足法定人數時，不得付表決」，黃宇人曾起疑問，以爲不足法定人數應即散會，此條似無要，然經陳願遠，吳望伋先後以草案第十二章「秩序」第七十條「出席委員先行退席者，不影響開會法定人數之計算」之規定，相與引證，說明起草委會及主稿小組因研究第七十條之顧慮，而在「表決」章增加一條之經過，並謂：如此規定旣可免除不愼重之表決，且可維持無決議事項會議之正常進行。最後復由孫院長以英國議會爲例，詳爲喩釋，黃之疑問方告解除，至此，議事規則之二讀已進行一半，散會時間已屆，孫院長宣稱：第八車「同意權之行使」，午前費三小時，尙無結論。第九章「聰取報告與質詢」，亦極重要，十九日以國大會堂須加布置，作爲廿日總統。副總統就職典禮之禮堂，停會一日，如無其他困難，則於廿日午後開第二次會議，繼續討論。然以尙待發言者仍有五十餘人，其意見宜以書面具體　就，送往秘書處提出，下午六時一刻散會。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>南韓普選以後的朝鮮政局</h3>
<p>十日的　韓普　，已在騷動不　的氣氛中完成了。報吿書雖然尙在起軍之中，但據　　消息：南韓八百萬　民，投票的，殆無疑義。聯合國朝鮮委員會叙利亞代表莫希，於巡視漢城各選區後，曾發表談話稱：「南韓選舉已獲成功，選舉進行順利，組織情形亦佳。」委員會正準備來上海，草擬報吿，，向小型聯大交代；據美駐韓軍司令霍奇中將稱：「南韓的選舉，爲民主空前之勝利。」他確信南輪於不久後，將完成組織政府的工作。此在李承晚本人也說：「余將命令北韓人民和共產軍棄蘇聯而幡然來歸」，似有無限的樂觀。惟在另一方面，南北韓國局勢的發展，仍是非常沉重的。南韓的單獨選舉，並未帶來樂觀的徵象，而且增加了南北韓分裂的因素。這是韓國的悲劇，也就是朝鮮人民的悲哀！</p>
<p>韓國悲劇的演出，加深韓國南北的分裂；而且這個不幸的分裂，勢必使朝鮮淪爲希臘第二；現在南北韓國政局的發展，不僅說明了分裂的局面愈演愈深，而且也說明了困處於齊楚之間的韓國人，不量力，不自覺，自投分裂之網，他們的前途是非常可悲的。美國近期「現代史料」論述韓國的悲劇，指出「目前朝鮮的分裂局面，並非　鮮人自已的　失，原因在美　，的競爭，美　都不　放棄朝鮮的地位，於是　成了割　　　面。運為眞難於　；無疑會　生悲偉的結果，不但朝鮮　劍編　將破壞無遺，它的　　可能影響世界和平。美蘇兩國明知鐵局勢的嚴　，但是牠們仍都不惜孤注一擲，當然悲哀的是朝鮮人民·」這是公正的看法，預示韓國將產生悲慘的結果，造成一幕冷酷非常爲韓國歷史曠世未有的內。</p>
<p>美蘇明知韓國問題潛伏的危機，可是他們都不惜孤注一　·四月卅日平　電台宣布：北韓已通過管轄全國（包括美軍　領軍在內）的憲法，憲法規定以漢城爲「朝鮮民主人民共和國」的首都，目前則暫設平壤。按北韓憲法的通過，和十四日平壤會議的召開，充分說明蘇聯承認北韓爲自主國家蘇聯對于韓國問題的態度，將不以美國或南韓爲對象，而將今後一切事情的責任交給北韓了。美軍司令霍奇一面表示：「該憲法由北韓人民委員會所批准，北韓人民委員會乃蘇軍佔領區共黨所控制之臨時政府」。并披露渠於四月廿七日致北韓蘇軍司令科洛科夫之函件，內稱：「余幷不承認人民委員會爲北韓之政府，余亦不願與人民委員會進行談判」。另一方面，則不惜抹煞韓國民意，斷然實施南韓單獨選舉。在十日投票之時，更不惜以武力彈壓騷動，脅追人民參加投票。參加這次南韓選舉的，主　人　　　　　和　　　，其他的無黨無　和右　人士，多是纏　李承　一　的·李爲　　人物，金爲　日的舊人，除此以　，幷無反黝派參加，甚至金九金　植也不　參加競選·所以　，這尤南韓　選　，是一　美日合　的表演，　　為了對抗　　，他所表現的政治　用，似乎不免落後了，　了　　本人自　「為民主　　之　　」外，側目面　的人，　不　　　　感言　　。</p>
<p>北　為了　　復　　　　　，　　了　　右派及中間派，於十四日在平　舉　二度會商，這次會商可能討論組織政府問題，同時北韓以停向南韓供電爲威脅，不惜斬　南北關係。南韓的電力，有百分之廿以上靠北韓供給，南韓幷未繳付電費；美軍對北　停止　電，日前調來軍艦兩艘，駛往釜山與仁川，準備以軍艦電力供應南韓。北韓這一歩　，是對南韓的重大反擊，意　重大，勢必引起美蘇之間發生新的危機。許多人憂慮南北韓分裂形勢的嚴重，美蘇對立的尖銳化，將由冷戰轉入熱戰，使朝鮮淪爲希　第二。</p>
<p>韓國的分裂，南北韓出現兩個政府，為遠東前途着想，是萬分可　的。「現代史　」論朝鮮問題，呼　美蘇和平，主張</p>
<p>（1）美蘇立即准許韓國獨立，由中立機構進行普選；（2）美蘇相信朝鮮人有自主　力，應交付朝鮮人　　；或者（3）美蘇根據莫斯科協定，韓國由中·英·美·蘇四國託管五年，　以避免美蘇直接的衝突。我們雖不完全贊同這三項意見，但我們鑑于韓國形勢的嚴重，是同意美蘇和平解決韓國問題的；在此分合的關頭，如不從分裂的危機中救出韓國，朝鮮人民必將陷於戰亂的浩刦中。</p>

<h3>食米又趨上漲　麥粉堅定雜糧向榮</h3>
<p>食米市况，緩步上升，因產地無錫價格未小，執主心思轉堅。加以本街實銷甚佳，出少進多，乃吿挺升。北市塲白粳漲十五萬，薄稻則挺二十五萬，各開五百六十六萬，秈米等一致挺十五萬，南市塲各檔粳秈亦一律漲十五至二十萬。市塲報價單較市價低二十萬，昨日客貨登記共到四千九百〇七石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>稍見回漲，因內地價不跌，米市又升，人心轉活，貨主均有從低價扳高之意，市乃向榮，散戶亦有趁短檔納進者。老車，兵船，各爲一百八十三萬收市，紅蜂，建成，均爲一百八十萬，各高於上日三萬元。中信局仍聯合各廠拋售，價仍爲一百八十萬，因市價已高，購者踴躍，售出一萬二千五百包。麩皮東洋帮吐出，獨跌四五萬，小麥原價不動。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>續秀，蓋自外匯提高後，人心猶堅，加之米價報漲，更使貨主扳價，黃豆在油廠之吸進下，終挺十萬，漢口乍豆報三百萬，菉豆平定，苞米存貨稀少，靑島客納，漲起二十五萬元。紅糧續在酒坊之添辦下，加十萬元。揀靑平疲，芝蔴漲四十萬，生仁廣帮有取，昂五六十萬元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>徘徊之象，豆油開市平穩，大統及同豐開過一千二百七十萬，旋大有及大昌新豆油最高曾升爲一千三百萬，惟中植廠盡量以一千二百二十萬之價開出生菜油，遂亦使豆油欲漲猶止，結果微昂一二十萬不等。生油早市加二十萬，臨收下游，淸油等均祗一二十萬上落。小軍蔴油獨漲五十萬，豆餅以散戶交易爲多，長字餅廠開一百四十萬，回籠一三九萬，軋升五萬元。</p>

<h3>民調會今日起　大量拋米</h3>
<p>業已跌入限價之米價，昨日因受環境之刺激，又上漲五萬至十萬元。據民調會負責人稱？米價回漲完全爲人心受環境刺激，此乃一時現象，不足爲患。蓋近日來食米來源漸趨正軌，存底亦日有增加、兼之民調會爲協助中央銀行抽緊銀根起見，決定自今日起，大量拋售食米，以資抑平米價，此項拋售，在與中央銀行密切合作抽緊銀根未達理想之前，決不停止。</p>
<h3>美米源源而來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國輪船公司經理之愛特華特號，昨日中午抵滬，運來食米九千〇五十噸，現泊日暉港碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>大戶繼續斬售　華股不脫疲局</h3>
<p>華股昨中途不脫疲局，良以大戶繼續斬售，散買雖股，不支而踣，近午更低，後市起始見反動。銀根又鬆，臨收時已趨堅定。</p>
<p>晨初人心承前收餘氣，銀根趨鬆而見穩。永紗開二七六〇元高盤，進至二七七〇元，再退至二七二五元，代辦費開高至三六元及四〇元，再跌至二七〇〇元。近午大戶及紗花帮斬售，跌至二六二五元低價。收市爲二六四〇元。較前收計華新永公平平，美亞信和景福新光勤興華豐統益景綸新華各跌半成，餘股升降俱微。後市上場即因政院通過提高公敎人員生活指數而見穩，自二六九〇元開後，先被賣到二六八〇元，二二號等均買，銀根見濫，漲到二七四〇元，國行差進八千餘億，一〇六號一〇四號一一九號力售，曾迫低至二七〇〇元內。收市爲二七二〇元。收後喊價趨昻，較晨收計美亞新光景綸中絲各漲半成，餘均小升。塲外各未上市股票尙稱平穩。</p>
<p>公債　昨較平穩，統丙晨開二二萬六，高價二四萬三，低價二二萬一，而後轉盤。較前收計甲乙升四千元，丙漲五千元，丁戊各升三千元，成交約四百萬。</p>
<p>外股　昨十分平庸，起仆有限。怡紗晨開四五〇萬，高價止於四五三萬五，低價亦不過四四八萬，最後在四五〇萬左右徘徊。證劵帮賣出，洋商及猶太帮均進。較前收計怡紗業廣怡　鋼業微升，英聯會德豐微挫，紙版航業平平。</p>
<h3>行局差進　八千餘億</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根，走勢先緊後弛。市塲暗息則仍高居三三角二分至三角五分左右。據非正式消息，銀根之回鬆，主要係北方游資湧到之故。惟銀錢業票據交換中，四行二局一庫仍有大量差進，總額達八二三〇億元。就中中央銀行獨家差進五五一二億，中國銀行差進六一五億，交通銀行差進三五五億，郵匯局差進八四六億，中央合作金庫進一〇三七億，農民銀行差出二三億，中信局差出一一二億。商業行莊大交換差出三五六〇億，小交換差出六三五〇億，本市外商銀行共計差進一六八〇億。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日外匯牌價掛高後，市面略受刺激，兼以平津游資之抵達，銀桹稍見緩和，商品市塲重見漲風，各項日用品價格之上揚參差不齊，平均約在半成左右。昨日國家行局又以各種方式抽緊銀根，共差進八千二百三十億，國行方面表示今後除　拋紗布油　外，並將拋售白報紙油　。民調會亦將視市塲之需要，無限制供應食米。中信局爲避免差出起見，昨起亦暫停收騙桐油自各項跡像上觀察，國行抽緊鑲根穩定物價之意，頓爲堅決，惟昨日本市之銀根已較十七日上午爲鬆，下跌之物價已轉成盤局。</p>
<h3>傳說天津限制提現　滬金管局並無所聞</h3>
<p>關於外傳天津金融管理局爲配合各方需要，實施限制提現一說、金融當局人士於昨日接見記者時，表示並無所聞。彼並否認外傳華北游資每日到滬數量達五千億至一萬億之鉅，謳此項估計，未免過高，惟彼承認，若華北各地眞能實施限制提現，則對本市銀根之抽緊，當有重大　助云。</p>
<h3>行情高檔盤旋　紗布迂迴挺升</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開因去化較活，散戶哄抬多頭扳持，行情均在高檔開出。嗣以供應頻繁，浮多獲利吐售，復吿回挫。四十二支藍鳳細紗曾一度軋漲一千五百萬元，終以實銷淸淡，回小至二億九千萬元收盤，比上日續降二百萬元。金城及寳光亦再挫二三百萬元。四十支藍鳳則回好三百萬元。</p>
<p>二十一支雙馬紗，一度抬高至二億一千萬元，後因銀根又緊，逢高有拋，結果較上日仍步挺一千二百萬元。其餘二十支十六支等各級，均見續升三四百萬至一千一二百萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，客路去化雖呆、惟環境刺激仍多，銀根局部轉鬆，塲內人心興奮，買氣驟旺。漢口帮補進甚衆，山西帮仍有吸納，同業則以補空居多，惟染廠仍鮮活動，市盤迂迴上展。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布初開六百十萬元，逐步翱翔至六百廿八萬元，嗣聞紡建公司續有開售之訊，回低至六百廿五萬元收市，比上日勁升三十萬元。其餘各檔細布及嗶嘰粗布斜紋等，軋升亦有十萬至三十餘萬元不一。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司十一點時懸牌供售五福細布，價五百九十八萬，准購單加十四萬元有成交。另有廿支特細布售五百五十萬元，雷峯塔元直貢六百卅萬，跳鯉元嗶嘰五百七十八萬，四君子元光斜四百六十萬，雷峯塔白府綢六百十萬，跳鯉精元細布六百卅萬元，最後龍頭細布成交價爲六百廿八萬元。</p>
<h3>人造絲回漲</h3>
<p>廠經仍疲綢貨高揚</p>
<p>人造絲昨市上漲，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤在三億八千萬元左右，旋至升至八千四五百萬元，一度降至七千八百萬元，後因供少求多，行情曾高至四億元。中午收盤即期價做三億八千五百萬元，隔日期九千二百萬元，下午頗平，結果做九千四百萬元賣出價，較上日大二千萬元之譜。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市依然不脫疲態，綢廠因綢銷淸稀，納胃甚薄，同業中有二十餘包成交。CD字等級價做四億九千萬元，有四天及六天期頭，高零擔喊價未動，交易甚稀，干經亦無變化，</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市高揚，眞絲被面上午開市一億八千萬元，旋即降至七千九百萬元，後因求過於供，冉冉上升，即期價最大曾到八千四百萬元左右，收市做八千一百五十萬元。大誠格子璧縐棧單，收市在六十五萬元之左。</p>
<h3>煤球議價初步核定　每担將為五十五萬</h3>
<p>物價評議會燃料組，於昨日午後，召開議價會議。對機製煤球公會要求調整煤球議價每担爲六十五萬元一節，討論後作初步決定，每担爲五十五萬元之講，俟由吳主任委員批准後決定。又火油配價，亦根據前日外匯調整百分之四十七。</p>
<h3>台糖疲極回振</h3>
<p>昨糖市因連日下瀉過甚，且已跌入配價，故進戶復有納胃，兼之廿一期改配特綿白價乃回振。公會劃盤現貨二四粗白初爲八百六十萬元，旋步升至九十萬元，升五十五萬元。四半白仍千萬元，二〇中砂白初爲八百三十五萬元，後升至六十五萬元，升五十萬元。特配粗白即交由八百十五萬元升至八百七十八萬元，升一成許。</p>
<p>棧單交易，因亦隨升。二十期粗白，今日交，由八百五十五萬元升至九百〇五萬元，升度相仿。週四交初爲八百四十五萬元，中途略有盤旋，後市升至九百十萬元。二十一期特綿白初加僅二十四萬元，後逐步升至一百〇五萬元，比前日升八十餘萬元。</p>
<h3>香烟肥皂回漲</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，初開本街採辦尙佳，嗣以大東南華明烟公司派貨，銀根益緊，大戶乘高拋售，行情軋挫。午後交易轉活，結果十支大英烟比上日回漲一百萬元，老刀軋平，其餘中外各烟亦都回挺，聽烟茄力克及三五牌去化較旺，軋升五六萬元。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，人心奇昂，進意濃厚，做開市盤固本皂回漲十三萬元，箭刀皂亦升十二萬元，其餘美麗光華祥茂等皂亦一致挺升。火柴洋燭仍維原盤，火油高度桶貨做二千二百萬元，聽裝美孚亞細亞二百三十萬元。</p>
<h3>收購外銷桐油辦法　行政院已分別予以修正</h3>
<p>當局爲扶助出口，爭取外匯，特恢復收購政策。桐油一項，業已付諸實施。由財·農·經三部，及中央銀行，四聯總處，輸管會、中信局等　關機關，組織收購外銷物資審價委員會，決定收購價格，由中信局負責辦理。茲悉：中信局收購外銷桐油辦法，政院已分別予以修正，茲探悉其修正之要點如次：</p>

<h3>春雨夜話</h3>
<p>— 雨琴</p>
<p>「我從沒有看見過雨有頭。也許雨眞的無頭吧？不，雨是有頭的。不過頭很高。要看牠，不是你我凡夫隨便可享的眼福。但是，雨脚是不難看見的。我常常看見牠，也曾聽得別人談起牠，在一本舊詩上，我還記得有『雨脚東南來』和『風驅雨脚回」的句子。李白的詩你是讀過的，你總還記得他的：「白雨映寒山，森森似銀竹」吧；他所寫的銀竹，不是我所說的雨脚嗎？</p>
<p>「雨不但有頭，有脚，而且也有性情。雨的天賦的性情是怎樣呢？從大·小·急·緩上去劃分：『傾盆大雨』和『如絲細雨』應該是暴燥與溫柔的兩種性情的表　。在時間上，前者多半是來勢兇猛，爲時不久的；後者多半是姗姗而來，綿綿不止的。一個是橫暴。野蠻的；另一個却是和平的。也可以這樣說：一個是男性的；另一個却是女性的。幽美的。」</p>
<p>「你知道，在夏天有「黃梅雨』。那，正是詩人所說的：『四月天炎燠，苦雨初入梅」。夏天的雨，被目爲苦雨，也許是因爲牠不及風那樣受人歡迎；並且又落向酸梅的心。『梧桐雨』，那更爲詩人所常吟詠：『零落桐葉雨』，「秋雨梧桐葉落時』，這些多少總帶着一點所謂悲秋之感。冬日的雨，應呌牠做『臘梅雨』。因牠是十足的表現橫暴。野蠻的性情，吟詠牠的似乎較少，如『雨連鶯曉落殘梅』的詩句是寥寥可數的。春雨，牠可和這些不同。在長恨歌中，不是有『玉容寂寞淚欄干，梨花一枝春帶雨』的句子麽？帶雨的梨花，在這裏，變成了一張憑欄垂淚的美人底玉容。這句子，說明了王環的所以傾國，也說明了梨花在春雨中怪美麗，怪惹人愛憐。春天的雨是甚麼雨？這種雨的性情怎樣？詩人對這性情的感想如何？你該知道了。」</p>
<p>「夜雨，是一把琴，在高山幽谷中，孤獨的漫奏着凄淸的曲調。你瞧，雨絲不是琴絃？滴滴的雨聲，不是絃上彈出的曲調？『大絃嘈嘈如急雨，小絃切切如私語」，「急者悽然以促，緩者舒然以和」的大小和緩急，不是變宮變商？而我和你，不是琴心的傾聽者麼？</p>
<p>「聽雨，彷彿是一個很雅的名詞，尤其是雨夜的時候，因爲靜的緣故，便很容易生出雅的興緻來。「臥聽疎雨梧桐」，這是多麽富有畫意的一句詞呢！還有，那喜歡「留得殘荷聽雨聲」和悔恨『不種芭蕉沒雨聽』的人，他們的心情是如何的難過呵！」</p>
<p>「眞的，雨不下就不說，一下，難免不　，一聽，心情彷彿被牠抓住，使人想到平時無暇細想的許多事情上去。『西窗又吹暗雨」，你能禁止你的心不聽麼？聽了，像空谷的回聲一樣，你的心決不會不起一種反應。不是想到久已撕去的日曆，便是計劃眼前的事物或將來的希望，這是內向的想；外向的想呢？那眞多，遠在天涯的朋友，不知還記得兒時的同窗？紅樓的戀人，春夢可好？故鄉的白髮，該不會爲家計而過於累贅……</p>
<p>「你一定在想，但不知所想的是甚麽？對着『靜鎖一庭愁雨，灑空階，夜蘭未休』的今夜，雖然我們沒有『故人剪燭西窗雨」，而是在『遊地重邀聽雨眠』，你旣已經聽着雨，還能够不想嗎？」</p>
<p>「我並沒想；不，我是在想　。但所想的並不多，我能想的也是我要想的。那是誰？旣不是　親，也不是戀人，更不是朋友；但也是母親，是戀人，是朋友，是我底一切親愛的廣泛的人類。在這「　渝無情風雨」的夜晚，一定有許多不同的人在不同的方法下打發牠，但在許多不同的人裏，那最無法打發而又不能不打發的人，也就是說，那在低矮而破爛的茅屋裏的人，「牀上屋漏無乾處，雨脚如麻未斷絕』的那種杜甫當年的苦况，想來深深地飽嚐到了，可是我和你却安躺在牀上！唉，安躺在牀上！」</p>
<p>像一隻前，深深地射入了我底肺腑；像一塊鉛石，重重地壓住了我的朋友底心。雨是好的，春來的夜雨尤其好，然而，我和聯牀對話的朋友，爲甚竟會『聞雨傷春夢不成』呢？</p>
<h3>詩歌語錄</h3>
<p>— 汪揚錄</p>
<p>詩歌的最重要起源之一是勞動。——布　爾</p>
<p>詩，就是由熱情之力，生氣躍如地輸送到人心裏的眞理。——華茲華綏</p>
<p>我那詩全是即興詩　從現實受了暗示，並以現實爲堅實的基礎。——歌德</p>
<p>詩人之所以爲詩人·就在他有一種才能會把平凡的對象引到典趣這方面。——歌德</p>
<p>沒有一個詩人能寫　他從沒經驗過的東西。——易卜生</p>
<p>詩人常常懷抱着一種做慢的信念，用「未來」來擁護自己——雨果</p>
<p>原始的詩人是團體的一種功能，稍後的詩人是受一人或多人的使命而替他們紀錄的，近代的詩人則只受自己個人的命令。——邁爾</p>
<h3>鄭曼青書展</h3>
<p>— 馬公愚</p>
<p>淡寫花枝惟有君，絳紗帳下士如雲；輕敎三絕江南老，並世何人館廣文？</p>
<p>吾鄕山水有淸昔，　落其人况折肱；一語頤淵傳月旦，西來爭說鄭靑藤。</p>
<p>論藝飄風二十年，浮生如畫亦　烟；江湖萬狀歸雙管，賣向人間邱壑緣。</p>
<h3>觀劇快談</h3>
<p>— 李朴園</p>
<p>李洪辛編劇洪深導演的「大涼山恩仇記」，前天的招待會沒趕上，前天承該劇演出委員呂復光生的好意，先覩爲快地觀光了第一塲。</p>
<p>洪辛先生同我住在一起，一大涼山恩仇記」的排練情形一直在我的關切之中；而且，我也一直是希望着她底早日上演，給糜　到了極點的這上海的生活　新而有力地刺激的。</p>
<p>所以，這個「先觀」之「快」，頗多「與衆不同」！</p>
<p>事實上，不止「覩」這「談」都是愉快的。</p>
<p>李洪辛先生是個「瘦小精悍」的人。第一次見面只覺得他是黑裏帶俏，第一篇讀到的「送不掉的孩子」是一個活潑生動的獨幕劇，再也沒想到，如今搬上舞台的他的「大涼山恩仇記」，竟是有這樣大的深心，有這樣大的氣魄。</p>
<p>這個戲是以楊文華這個中學生似的人物代表了劇作者的態度，使用着各種適當的機會宣述了戲的主題的。主題是：漢夷一家，應該平等，應當推愛，應該團結，不應該互相猜疑，各以各的優越感互相仇視。這主題，在這個全國各方面都以各種不同的觀點圖謀着全民族底團結同福利之增進的現階段，是非常正確，非常値得珍貴的；在我，却以爲從另一方面看，這種從事於邊疆與中原，多數與少數同胞之文化的，血液的交流的工作精神，却尤其値得大大地推崇。沒有同邊疆少數同胞當面的時際，我們漢族不免坐井觀天，不免夜郞自大，一同這些同胞當面，我們才覺得萎糜，才覺纖弱，才覺得神經同血液兩俱衰老，才覺得我們這種多心，猜忌，勾心鬥角……是自取煩惱，是自取衰亡，是小氣到不値一笑！不錯，社會交給我們的祖子是重大得够挑的，而，要挑這担子需要更闊的肩膀，更大的勇氣，更新的血液，更强的生命力……這些，在我們底現生活裏幾乎已經找不到，可，在邊疆的少數同胞那裏却有的是，有的是！不說別的，單是看看「大凉山恩仇記」的這演出，三個鐘頭的工夫，一服孟子所說的「浩然之氣」，我相信，就會在我們底生命裏大大地鼓舞一氣的！這個戲的主題好，氣魄更好！</p>
<p>這個戲的結構，在第一幕的介紹部分就把「恩」同「仇」安排得很明顯，此後的發展，並沒有爲歌舞，戰鬥，以及跳火……這些大塲面所冲淡，主要的綫索仍在一步逼緊一步地進行着，一直逼出轟轟烈烈五條人命的悲劇結果；洪淺哉先生也始終把握着劇作家底要求，在動作的大體節奏上，也處理得非常得體；裝置，燈光，服裝不用說，大體上同劇作家沒有不合，就是演員的演技，呷呷，烏沙克，珊拉娜，亞猛，蘇　　，也都能勝任愉快——萬一非描出點陰影不可的話，我覺得，我們到底是漢人，我們底身體旣不够强壯，我們底生命力也不大够充沛！</p>
<p>然而，這究竟是小節對不對？如果我們多有幾個這樣的戲，多幾次練習，「人定」，到底可以「勝大」，不是嗎？</p>
<h3>蘇州孔廟（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 張紫璵</p>
<h3>加萊斯海岸</h3>
<p>— 英·華滋華斯作　真勤試譯</p>
<p>那是個美麗的傍晚，靜，淸澈，神聖的時光，靜如修女一樣屛息着在禮　；闊大的太陽正在它底寗謐中逐漸沉落；蒼天的大慈悲君臨着大海：聰啊！那偉大的「生命」正醒着用他底永恒的律動發出了一個轟雷的聲音——亘古不改。跟我同行着的親愛的女孩！假使你好像不竹觸及聖念，你底天性不會因而不崇高：你整年都躺在亞伯底胸懷，在神廟底內殿裏崇拜，禮讚，上帝　着你，我們却不知道。</p>
<p>〔華滋華斯（W．Wordsworth），一七七〇年生，一八五〇年死。是早爲國人所熟知的英國浪漫派大詩人。這首十四行詩是詩人的傑作，於一八〇二年作於加來斯，初次　表於一八〇七年之「詩集」中，原版無題。第一行之「淸澈」，原作free，依韋勒氏（Wheeler）之說，可作free　from　clouds即無雲解。第六行之「生命」指海。第十二行中所用的典，見路加福音（Luke）十六章二十二節，拉塞路斯（Lazarus）即躺在亞伯（Abraham）胸中；但通常是指死人說的。——譯者〕</p>
<h3>王安石日記</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>有宋一代，日記漸興，作者輩出。如歐陽修·司馬光·曾布·趙忭·張舜民·黃庭堅·周煇·周密。陸游。范成大·程卓。周必大·黃驥之·鄒伸之·趙槩。張方平等，咸嘗手書日記。今見其書，或存其目者，無慮數十家。</p>
<p>微王安石所撰日錄，卷帙浩繁，爲炎宋諸記冠，世尠有評隲之者。茲不憚詞費，略述如下。安石，相神宗，以倡新法名，紹聖初，諡曰文，追封舒王。一生事蹟，詳見宋史卷三百二十六列傳第八十六。按日記今已散佚；史乘著錄卷數，亦復不一。宋史藝文志稱十二卷，周煇淸波雜志謂八十卷，趙德麟侯　錄則云七十卷。意者，煇係南宋時人。距熙寗初，爲時僅約五十年；煇所見者，自屬全帙。趙氏所睹，或乃另一鈔本。而宋史云云，似即殘本，亦未可知。要之，據周趙二書，則荆公所誌，大柢詆毀不附己之士。個性抝折，表　靡遺。一說：宋蔡條北狩行錄稱徽宗紹述神考之志，未嘗忘懷，適有貨王安石日錄者，欣然以絹十匹易之云云。（見四庫全書總目提要）</p>
<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>捷克文學之夜</p>
<p>最近莫斯科的中央外國文學圖書館和斯拉夫協會聯合舉行了一個捷克文學的晚會。節目有俄譯的捷克詩歌和散文的朗誦以及捷克文學發展的談話。圖書館還展覽斯拉夫族文學俄譯的展覽，有捷克斯　伐克，優哥斯拉夫，波　和保加利亞諸國作家的作品。</p>
<p>開始由蘇維埃作家聯合會總秘書法捷也夫（Alexander　Fadeyev）致辭，他說起捷克文學的傳統，俄國文化與斯拉夫族人民的密切關係，法捷也夫强調着說，兩國都接近羣衆，都有自由精神和崇高的人性。談到相互的影響和與西方文學的關係，法捷也夫說起，十九世紀的俄國文學，特別是在詩人助可夫斯基（Zhukovsky）的時代以後，便不再倚賴西方文化。俄國文學在世界文學中久已獲得重要的地位。捷克文學在爾克里次基（Wrkhlitski）以後，也無須再倚靠西方文化。述者加重說，反之，西歐還要向斯拉夫人民學習。</p>
<p>聽衆熱烈地歡迎捷克的女作家格拉莎蘿娃（J．Glazarova）。她談到俄國文學對於捷克文學的影響，捷克有許多聯蘇作家作品的譯文。她又說起，捷克作家的作品譯成蘇聯文字的也不少，她極感到感謝。</p>
<p>格拉莎蘿娃又談到希特勒恐怖佔領的時期。納粹黨要想把捷克文化趕出去。在納粹獸性下犧牲的有：新聞記者與文學的學者傳西克（Julius　Fucik），凱沛克的哥哥約瑟。凱沛克（Joseph　Capek），小說家樊寇拉（Vladislav　Vancura），（他寫有小說「麵包師馬　爾」（JanMargoul　the　Baker），初稱爲捷克的「吉訶德先生」）詩人與俄國詩的譯者賀拉（Joseph　Hora），有名的幽默家坡拉克（Karl　Polak）著名的作家與納粹的反抗者克拉托　爾（Jaroslav　Kratohvil），此外還有一些人。但捷克的文化不會滅亡的。舊時代的文人已經換了年靑的作家，他們都是在戰時和戰後出來的，其中有：　爾　拉特（Ivan　Olbraht）是一位心理分析的小說家，女作家馬吉蘿娃（Maria　Majerova）寫過幾本工人奮鬥的小說，此外有蒂兒蘇娃（Anna—MarieTilsova）牛曼（Stanislav　Nenman）　。</p>
<p>法國白羅契逝世</p>
<p>法國著名的作家與反納粹者白羅契（Jean—Richard　Bloch）近已逝世。蘇聯的「文學雜誌」（Literaturnaya　Gazeta）把這消息公佈了出來。蘇聯作家協會刊登了一篇哀悼的文字：「許多年來，白羅契都是我們國家和文化的朋友」。當西班牙人民反對希特勒的僱工法朗哥的時睽，白羅契是第一個到西班牙去的人。</p>
<p>這位反法西斯蒂的作家戰時離開祖國，一直都住在蘇聯。蘇聯的作家還記得反納粹的演說。好幾千地下工作的法國人聽過他的　綫電播音。他從莫斯科發出廣播，稱　蘇聯人抵抗德國侵略，鼓勵他本國人要　蘇聯學習，與侵略者戰鬥到底。</p>
<p>白羅契是以作家和反法西斯主義者的雙軍資格回到法國去的。哀悼文中說：「法國戰後的民主，虧得有白羅契勇敢而又誠懇的聲音。</p>
<p>「我們是他的蘇聯的讀者和朋友，要永遠記住白羅契動人的個性，他那不自私的勤謹和樂觀，即使在最困難的時候，也不放棄他那竹家和戰鬥的責任」。</p>
<p>蘇聯作家對外文化協會以及「蘇聯文學」和「文學雜誌」的主編已寄慰問信給死渚的家族朋友和同事們。</p>

<h3>老年的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 毛子水</p>
<p>人類和其他高等動物不同的地方，或文化較高的人和文化較低的人不同的地方，當然很多。最容易看得出的，就在「反省」的能力和程度上。所謂反省，就是回憶過去的行爲而辨別他們的是非善惡。（不容說的，這裏所謂是非善惡，自然以整個人類的利害爲標準。）反省似乎是人類文化進步一種最大的原動力。我以爲「上等人」和「下等人」的分別，當然不是因地位的高低，亦不是因職業的不同，而應當用他們反省的程度爲標準。孔子生平所最佩服的人裹邊，有一個　伯玉。傳說這個　伯玉到了五十歲的時候才知道他以前行爲錯誤的地方。這當然指着倫理學意義上的是非善惡而言。如果照平常的意義來說，譬如一個人寫錯了一個字，或打錯了一張牌，自可馬上便覺察到，何必等待做過五十歲的生日以後呢。我想孔子的佩服蘧伯玉，就是因爲他有這種反省的功夫。</p>
<p>但是反省可以給我們以很大的苦悶！一個人如果糊裏糊塗過却一生，那就無話可說了。如果有點反省的能力，則老來神識漸漸淸爽（這種觀念，可能由於一個老年人的毫無根據的自負所發生）時，對於過去的錯誤，定必有「悔不可追」的心情。「悔」自是一件好事；「不可追」，則最是令人苦悶。無論怎樣微小的事情，只要曾經發生過，就會有不可磨滅的痕跡。當然，一個人知道自己的過失後，如能够很堅決的悛改，非特可以補救已往，並且可以創立新生命。以前的聖哲說過：「過而不改，是爲過矣！」「從前種種，譬如昨日死；從後種種，譬如今日生。」這些話，都是對於人生行爲最妥常最有用的指示。可惜這種對於自己過失的覺悟，往往來得很晚。蘧伯玉的故事，或許古人爲勉勵人而捏造的，但一個有思想的人，當然愈到老年，愈能够知道自己的過失。知過而能改，自然是人生的一種幸福。不過「夕陽無限好，只是近黃昏。」我想天下定有不少的老年人有這種悲哀的。</p>
<p>靑年人便不同了。一個靑年人，如果能及早覺悟自己的過失，能及早悛改，這種「不可追」的悔恨，非特要比老年人少，或可至於沒有。就這一層講，世間眞正的苦悶，只屬於老年人，靑年人是決不應該有的。</p>
<p>這還是就消極方面講的。若就積極方面講，更可以顯出這個道理。從前晋代周處的故事，眞正是「靑年」的故事，老年人恐怕便做不出了。一個人追悔已往，固然苦悶，一個人瞻望將來，如果覺得「力不從心」而「望洋興歎」，也是一件最苦悶的事情！靑年人則「來日方長」，只要努力向好處做去，「天下無難事」，總不至於一無所成的。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以說，就人生的行爲講，只有老年人有苦悶，靑年人是不應當有苦悶的。至於就世俗人情言，老年人衰老醜惡，到處令人生厭。靑年人便不至於。這也是老年人特殊的苦悶。恕不詳講，因爲恐怕太引起我的「同年」們的傷心了！</p>
<p>一個好人，總是希望世界一天比一天好，人類一天比一天快樂。所以好的老年人，沒有不希望世上的靑年人都以他們—老年人—爲股鑒，能及早「反省」，而向光明的道路上邁進的。老年人在這個世界上，如果有足以消遣他們苦悶的東西，那便是這種希望。如果世界上的靑年人，使這種希望愈來愈遠，則有思想的老年人，定必覺到最大的苦悶！</p>
<h3>名丑劉趕三</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>梅博士近年在此唱戲，頭一天打泡總是女起解，與之配崇公道者，以前寫蕭長華，這次在天蟾露演，改爲如富蕙，大約二順（蕭之小名）年歲太大，不能再來了京戲中名丑漸漸凋零，有好多戲，無好丑配，雖名生旦亦爲之减色。</p>
<p>余十八歲到故都讀書，爲淸光緒三十年，尙及見羅百歲，其扮羣英會中之蔣幹，天雷報中之老且皆佳，拿手戲爲絨花計，十二紅，王道士拿妖，打沙鍋等戲，看之者以爲歎觀止矣，然老輩則言百歲尙不及劉趕三。兩人之戲路，雖然不同，其扮戲冷雋傳神之處，必有高下分別。</p>
<p>聞趕三一日在王府堂會，唱嫖院一劇，扮一老鴇出來，見正中前排坐惇王，恭王，醇王三人，彼眼視三王，喊：「老五，老六，老七出來見客呀！」恭王大笑，醇王無言，獨惇王大怒，叫人將趕三拉下台來打軍棍，打畢仍令唱戲。光緒帝爲醇王之子，咸豐帝行四，惇王行五，恭王行六，醉王行七，趕三以老五，老六，老七指三王，誠然太惡作劇，然惇王竟因此發怒打人，亦未免太殺風景矣。</p>
<p>民主國家最重要的條件，爲言論自由，然而此事芷難說，愈是自命民主的國家，人民愈不能說話。老殘游記裏言：「大凡人肚子裏發話，有兩個所在，一個是從丹田底下出來的，那是自己的話，一個從喉嚨底下出來的，那是應酬的話。」優孟衣冠之所以可貴處，就是能代人說丹田底下的話，對於政治或人物有不滿的地方，以幽默滑稽口吻吐出之，極盡嬉笑怒駡的能事，這樣的名丑，現在不易再得了。</p>

<h3>全運會感言</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>十餘年來，社會上一旦發生了什麽動亂，無論是政治性的或是經濟性的，當局總是少不得要發表「套「治標」「治本」或是「標本兼治」的宏論。而這麼「治」了十有餘年，其「本」其「標」，矻然不動，依然故我，其故安在哉？筆者認爲理由簡單得很，蓋是由於根本並沒有眞正在做「治」的工作；換言之，由於政府機構之「無能」，由於不講究辦事的「效率」。我國大半腐化現象之病根即在這「無能」二字。這個問題，據筆者看，委實嚴重得很，即使戡亂完成之後，這個病根不除，一切恐怕還是不會有辦法。</p>
<p>即以此次全國運動大會爲例，頗有數事顯得辦事方面步調凌亂，佈置不週。試思全運會是何等大事，塲內民衆之擁擠當不難預見。我們的吳市長眞是幹練，他倒是事先想到「便」的問題，據他估計，「最好會場內有容納之五百人的厠所，方能在大會前門收票。否則大小便沒有解決，會成很大的問題。」可是在揭幕前夕，經吳市長細詢會塲負責人時，這位負責人才「默默地記憶」，這裏便桶一只，那裏便斗二只，這才發現一共是便桶二十一隻，小便糟祗有七隻。而其中有的水箱漏水，有的便桶四週都是汚水，「兩個盥洗盆還在臨時堆砌」。市長問：「怎麽這時候還未做好？」職員答：「做好了壞掉了，現在正在修理。」要看小便槽，職員說：「原定計劃是做的，現在因爲人工不够，只好省去了。」</p>
<p>筆者原也是個運動迷，本想去會塲看看，可是看了報紙這段記事，心便冷了半截。心想或許要出別的亂子吧。果不其然，大會第一天下午，有人自會塲回去吿訴我說：看台欄杆倒塌了，傷了許多人。我聽了這個消息，疑信參半，心想運動塲看台的欄杆是塲內何等重要的設備，又不是小孩所玩的積木架成的，那里會倒塌？市區跑馬　看臺的欄杆，這麼幾年來就從未聽說倒塌過，定是什麼歹人造謠中傷。可是「事與願違」，據次晨報載，竟是事實，有的人是跌傷了，有的人是斷了臂，一共有男女三十二名受傷。此事下文自然是「追査責任」——以後呢，大槪也就未必有什麽下文了。</p>
<p>此外例如有許多觀衆買了票不能入塲，據「追査責任」的結果，說是因爲塲內有許多人無票入塲，以致過於擁擠的緣故。這麽一來，便把責任推到了觀衆頭上去，而買了票的觀衆恰也是觀衆之一部份，於是也就無話可說，「應毋庸議」。又如十一日天雨，各項比賽停止舉行，裁判組人員因爲未獲停止比賽之通知，所以仍是冒雨赴塲去執行職務，結果是撲了一個空，不免口出怨言，責負責人「尋他們開心」。諸如此類的事，充份表現「爾爲爾，我爲我」的「獨立精神」，正如一位記者所說：「祗要『開幕』，『禮成』，『奏樂』，以後，死人也不管了。」實則在「禮成」「奏樂」之前是否死了人有人在官，亦不無疑問。</p>
<p>最妙的事是：於一萬公尺長跑決賽中，賽員樓文敖「在半途中受到幾個賽員的有意阻擋」，據說被攔阻的結果，樓君左避右躱，東竄西闖，要想突出重圍，馴致步伐有如舞蹈。論者或謂這種舉動那裏還有什麼Sportsmanship，却是以Statesmanship的手腕來從事運動了。筆者覺得這種舉動却也像美國議會裏的Filibrstering。善哉，善哉！</p>
<h3>蹈火的人們</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>在南太平洋中，有一個由二百五十個大小島嶼合組而成的斐濟羣島，住着近二十萬名的土人，每年逢到「維拉維哀里伏節」（Wilaviairevo），他們便舉行一次蹈火的表演，外人就稱之爲「蹈火節」。土人在表演的時候，都赤裸了雙脚在白熱的岩石上行走和跳舞。他們並不施甚麼魔術，也不在脚底塗任何藥膏，但是居然能够絲毫不被灼傷，自從白種人征服了這個羣島之後，武力强盛的他們例對土人的蹈火表演咋舌不已。表演的斐濟人顯然是毫無痛苦，他們敏捷的走在熾熱的岩石之上，脚底連一個泡也不起。</p>
<p>表演之前先在地上掘一個直徑約三十呎的圓形淺坑，裏面塡滿了乾燥的樹枝和薪柴。然後用火　將樹柴引燃、再將石頭滾入火光熊熊的淺坑中，就這樣的讓石頭在火坑中熱上一個半天，再次一步的手續是將新鮮的綠葉舖在白熟的石頭上，引起了一陣水汽，乘着水汽瀰漫的當口，表演者赤足走入火坑，跳起「土風舞」來，假如異鄕的傍觀者沒有聯想到蹈火者脚下的熱石頭，他眞要興起「飄飄欲仙」之感了。</p>
<p>但是，斐濟土人眞的練就了金剛之身，不怕火燒熱燙嗎？不。說穿了，蹈火表演也祗能歸類於「戲法」之中——關鍵還在乎「各有巧妙不同」。原來斐濟羣島全部都是火山質，島上的石頭原先都為火山噴射冷却而成的，所以孔洞極多，就是被燒成白熱的狀態，也不會保留熱度的，再加在這些石塊上厚厚的舖了一層綠葉，更保護了蹈火者的雙足，直如在綠葉氈上舞蹈。如將火山質的石頭換作海灘邊的卵石，斐濟土人一定要「敬謝不敏」了。</p>
<h3>盲史家</h3>
<p>— 宋賢</p>
<p>距今一百多年前，一個美國靑年潑來斯科Prescott不幸因與同學的嬉戲，兩目重傷，一隻竟完全破碎了。他住在醫院裏一連幾個月，每天睡在黑暗的房間裏，雖然經過好些名醫的診治，他那剩下的半隻眼睛仍然無法重見光明。</p>
<p>他勉力讀完了大學，畢業後在他父親的律師事務所工作，可是眼睛仍然發痛。經過了各種診治的方法，反而變本加厲起來。於是他只好住在黑房裏，房間裏完全漆黑，連桌椅床舖也都看不見。每天的運動也祇是在室內摸索着散步而已。</p>
<p>一個資質聰明的靑年陷於半殘廢的境地，其前途大槪是無望了。然而事實並不如此，潑來斯科憑着他驚人的毅力，終於完成了一件偉大的工作。他在黑房裏竟完成了十六部厚厚的著作，成爲一個著名的歷史家！</p>
<p>每天每天，他坐在漆黑的房間裏，細聽助手代讀無數的參考書。他便記憶在腦中，然後列出綱要，經過了長時期的思考，整理，便把自己的著作逐段口述出來。這樣枯燥的生活，他竟度過了三十九個春秋，先後完成了西班牙歷史，墨西哥歷史，秘魯史等十六部書。且內容淸晰公正，被國際上公認爲歷史的標準著作。</p>
<p>最後的十年中，他的眼睛差不多完全失明了，心臟也漸漸退化。然而他仍然是樂觀的，興奮的。</p>
<p>「你們別以爲我因此而消沉，不！不會的。我的興趣將跟我的脈搏一樣，比平常人跳得更快！」他說。</p>
<p>潑來斯科的勇氣決非匹夫之勇，更不是探險家或投機家所抱有把成敗生死拚命一搏的勇氣。他的勇氣能使一個半殘廢的人在黑暗的世界裏，數十年如一日，永遠保持他的自信和樂觀。這是沉着的，持久的，埋頭苦幹的勇氣。</p>

<h3>The United States Is Concerned About China's Economic Situation; Hopes to See a New Situation at the Time of the Implementation of the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Report, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] According to diplomatic sources, the United States is extremely concerned about the situation in China.

All parties in the United States hope that China can have a new situation at this time, so as to further assist China and improve military and economic aspects in the near future. However, the US side is extremely concerned about the use of US aid. If the person in charge can be someone who has a relatively close relationship with the United States and is able to be responsible and pragmatic like Song Ziwen, the US's confidence in China will definitely increase, because Song's achievements in leading the construction of South China in recent years have been praised by people at home and abroad.</p>

<h3>Youth and Democratic Socialist Party Legislators Dispute; Currently Under Discussion to Find a Solution</h3>
<p>Report on the Process of Returning to Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Regarding the dispute between the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party legislators, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu and other seven people from the Kuomintang are currently discussing and negotiating a solution. It is reported that after the joint meeting held by the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party in Shanghai, they have expressed four opinions and one explanation. The four opinions are: (1) Respect the agreement between the three parties and maintain the original number of legislators. (2) Hope to still use the "Extraordinary Party" method to solve the number issue. (3) Agree to the solution by Lu Zhi, and when a considerable number is reached, the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party legislators will attend the meeting. (4) Hope to reserve a considerable number of convening members of each committee in the Legislative Yuan. The one explanation is that the issue of three-party cooperation is not insisted upon, but is only a policy issue and still includes issues other than policy. According to Kuomintang figures, the Kuomintang does not intend to make any statements regarding the various remarks made by the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party in Shanghai. Now is not the time for debate, and this debate is not beneficial to the cooperation of the three parties.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Lei Zhen returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 18th. At about 4:00 PM, he met with Kuomintang figures to report on the process of negotiating with the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party in Shanghai regarding the number of legislators, and to discuss solutions.

<h3>People of Wuxi Welcome and Cheer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 18th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang and his wife traveled from the Jinghang National Highway through Yixing to Wuxi on the 16th. For two days, they boated on Taihu Lake, visiting famous scenic spots such as Xuelang Mountain, Dushan, Longtouzhu, and Zhongdushan. After a long period of hard work, the Chairman was able to take this break and felt refreshed. As the presidential inauguration ceremony was approaching, they left Wuxi at 10:07 AM on the morning of the 18th and returned to Nanjing.</p>
<p>The electricity for the lights held in Liyuan Lake Scenic Area was supplied by the generators sent by the electricity company. The generators left last night, and the disturbing sounds of the generators could no longer be heard from the woods a thousand yards away. After a night's rest, the Chairman and his wife were refreshed and in better spirits. They got up at 6:15 AM on the morning of the 18th and went for a walk by the lake and did some stretching exercises. They had breakfast with their wife at 9:15 AM. At that time, the special car prepared for the Chairman had arrived at the Xizhan Station from Changzhou. The special train had a total of five cars, including a sleeping car, a living room car, a dining car, and an attendant car. It was just completed and presented to the President by the Jinpu Railway Administration. The carriages were green with white lines, novel and beautiful. At 9:45 AM, Chairman Chiang and his wife and Director Yu Jishi took a car from Liyuan Xinguan, passing through Huishan, Wuqiao, and Tonghui Road to the train station. Peng, Chief of Staff of the Wuxi Command, led the way in a jeep, and the Chairman's attendants and county government personnel followed in six cars of various sizes. Secretary Zhou Hongtao arrived at the station half an hour earlier to make arrangements. The people of Xixian County and military and police agencies and schools heard the news and lined up at the station to see off the Chairman. Wherever the Chairman's car passed, the crowd lined the street and shouted "Long live Chairman Chiang." The Chairman slowed down the car and waved frequently from the car window. After arriving at the station and getting off the car, he instructed County Chief Xu to convey his sincere gratitude to the enthusiastically welcoming people. Then he boarded the fourth carriage of the special train. The train slowly started amidst military music and cheers at 10:07 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 18th Dispatch] At 8:00 PM last night, when Chairman Chiang and his wife were returning from a tour of Dushan, Yang Xiaoyou, the owner of the Pingxiang Fang barge, asked the Chairman to write an inscription as a souvenir. The Chairman readily agreed and wrote the inscription "The boat of Yang Xiaoyou, the owner of Pingxiang Fang," and signed "Written by Chiang Kai-shek." Yang was extremely moved to receive this precious ink treasure, saying that in a day or two, he would enlarge the words written by the Chairman and carve them on the left edge of the Pingxiang barge as a souvenir.</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the First Session of the Legislative Yuan; Article-by-Article Discussion of Rules of Procedure; No Conclusion Yet Reached on "Exercise of the Right of Consent"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The first meeting of the first session of the first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution was held on the morning of the 18th. At 9:40 AM, President Sun Ke and Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan took their seats amidst applause to preside over the meeting. Mr. Zhang reported that the number of attending members was sufficient to open the meeting as required by law, and Mr. Sun announced the opening of the meeting and made a speech briefly stating: "My colleagues have mistakenly loved and trusted me, and I have been elected as President to share the heavy responsibility with you. I am truly terrified and excited. I hope that you will work together so that we do not fail in our mission." Then, he presented a temporary report, appointing Zhang Zhaoyuan as the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan based on the organizational regulations, and he would take office first. After the President was sworn in, he would submit a formal appointment request. The audience learned of Mr. Zhang's brief resume and welcomed him with applause. Then, Mr. Zhang read the report on the results of the vote for Vice President on the afternoon of the 17th. At 9:30 AM, the discussion began, starting with the rules of procedure. Tree Wen, the convening member of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee, briefly reported on the drafting process, explaining that after the four meetings and the efforts of the drafting team day and night, the chapters and articles of the draft had been formulated. However, no unanimous conclusion was reached on Chapter 8, "Exercise of the Right of Consent." After summarizing the differences, there were four types: "(1) It is advocated that it is necessary to allow those who propose policies and personnel opinions, because when exercising the right of consent to the President of the Executive Yuan, if no appropriate information is provided, it is difficult to determine the standard for whether to agree or disagree. Administration places great emphasis on facilities, and policy implementation depends on the selection of personnel. Therefore, when the President of the Executive Yuan requests consent, it seems appropriate to first propose policies and personnel opinions for reference. (2) It is advocated that policy opinions are the prelude to the policy guidelines in Article 57 of the Constitution, and it seems necessary to provide them for reference. As for personnel, they should be responsible for their own actions, and there is no need to propose opinions. (3) It is believed that Article 55 of the Constitution only stipulates that the President of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan, and there are no other regulations. It is advocated that there is no need to propose policies and personnel opinions. (4) It is advocated that in addition to not needing to propose policies and personnel opinions, the procedure does not need to be reviewed by the full committee and should be directly submitted to the plenary meeting of the Yuan for a vote." According to these four opinions, four different versions of Chapter 8, A, B, C, and D, were drafted (as seen in this newspaper on the 16th) and submitted to the general assembly for public decision. Chen Guyuan, the convening member of the drafting team, continued to put forward four key points: (1) The rules themselves are binding on the Yuan itself, and do not need to be promulgated by the President to be made into law. When drafting the draft, attention has been paid to not involving the constitutional powers of other agencies. As for the point raised by some members that special cases must be approved by two-thirds of the attending members before they can be passed, this has not been included in the draft as it requires amending the organizational law. (2) Political powers have been individually stipulated, but in addition to the right of interpellation, which the drafting committee decided to propose, there are four different articles regarding the right of consent, which are still awaiting discussion and decision by the general assembly. (3) In order to respect the spirit of democracy and equality, the number of people required for various motions has been reduced as much as possible, except for the powers of the President during the meeting, which are equivalent to the powers of an ordinary chairman. (4) In order to respect freedom of speech, the speaking time has been extended, but in order to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to speak, it is necessary to impose appropriate restrictions on the speaking time of individuals. At 10:10 AM, President Sun, with the consent of the audience, first conducted a broad discussion. Yang Yuqing and eight others spoke in succession, among whom only Jian Sanzeng emphasized the importance of the right of interpellation, opposed the two provisions in the draft that the time for interpellation was limited to after the report and that interpellation could not be used as a topic of discussion, and advocated that the exercise of the right of recommendation and the right of investigation should also be added. The rest of the opinions were unanimously focused on Chapter 8, whether the nominee should be allowed to propose policies and personnel opinions before exercising the right of consent, and whether the same should be subject to a review stage or a direct vote. The most important points in the previous meetings of the drafting committee are now present in the plenary meeting, and the ranks of both the pros and cons have increased. Yang Yuqing, Jian Guansan, Wang Puhan, Lu Yuwen, and Xu Pan Yun were in favor of the first opinion of the drafting committee and supported the A proposal, believing that personnel can influence policies, and it is necessary to know the President of the Executive Yuan's policies and opinions before exercising the right of consent, and it can also seek a basis for cooperation between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, and allow the President to know how to obtain political stability. They also claimed that those who advocate this have never asked for a specific list, but only think it is necessary to ask the President to notify the person nominated to propose policies and personnel opinions, which is very flexible and definitely not an unconstitutional or excessive request. Chen Shaoxian and Zhang Qingzhen held the second opinion and supported the B proposal, believing that policy opinions can be proposed, but personnel opinions should not be proposed. Zhu Wende believed that according to the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan can supervise the President of the Executive Yuan's personnel management through the method of controlling the President of the Yuan, and the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines will be proposed after the establishment of the Executive Yuan. The Legislative Yuan should not require the nominee for President of the Executive Yuan to propose policies and personnel opinions before exercising the right of consent. Lu Fu further pointed out that the exercise of the right of consent should be decided directly by voting, without the need for review by the full committee, which would delay time and affect government affairs, claiming to agree with the D proposal. During the meeting, Kong Geng once claimed that most of the broad statements were about Chapter 8 and that it was possible to discuss each chapter and article first, and then speak as much as possible when it came to Chapter 8. However, as there were more than 50 people requesting to speak, Kong's opinion was not accepted by the audience. At 12:00 noon, President Sun asked the audience to extend the meeting by half an hour, but it was not agreed. The President announced a temporary motion that the temporary chairman Wu Tiecheng and the temporary secretary-general Lou Tongsun should be comforted for their hard work in presiding over the preparatory meeting. All members applauded and passed the motion, and then adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3>Continued Meeting Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>The meeting will resume at 3:30 PM this afternoon. All attending committee members believe that there are still many who wish to speak. If a single, comprehensive discussion is held, it would take too long. Therefore, it was unanimously agreed to proceed chapter by chapter in a reading meeting format. The secretarial staff immediately began reading the full draft. The first reading was completed at 4:00 PM, followed by a second reading. The clauses of the draft were read out one by one, and either passed without objection, amended after discussion and voting, or maintained as originally written. Chapters One, "General Provisions," and Two, "Proposals," were smoothly passed. In Chapter Three, "Agenda," Huang Yuanbin and Lu suggested that if the agenda is delivered to each committee member two days before the meeting, it may be difficult to keep some important financial and economic matters confidential. However, Deng Hongye, Lei Yin, and others pointed out that secret meetings can be held at any time for financial, economic, and other important issues, as well as question-and-answer sessions. In such cases, the agenda should be distributed on an ad hoc basis. Special regulations should not be included in the rules of procedure. As a result, Article 20 was maintained in its original form. Article 24 of Chapter Four, "Meetings," stated, "The院 [referring to the Legislative Yuan] shall meet twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays, and may increase the number of meetings if necessary." Peng Chunshi proposed changing the first half of the sentence to "meet once a week on Fridays." Wu Shangying, however, believed that the meeting schedule should not be so rigid, and suggested modifying the first half of the sentence to "meet once a week as a principle." Du Guangtian, Lei Gu, Jiang Yiping, Zhang Jinjian, and others stood up to object, insisting that meetings must be held regularly to avoid difficulties in notification and to allow committee members to arrange their lives and work. They also emphasized that the constitutional Legislative Yuan should not be lazy, that power must be exercised in the meeting place, and that the number of meetings should not be too few. After a vote, the original proposal was maintained. In Chapter Five, "Readings," Article 36 of the second reading section, "Amendments to the reports of the committees shall be taken as agenda items," was deemed unnecessary and deleted. In Chapter Six, "Discussion," regarding speaking time, the original draft stipulated that speeches explaining, questioning, or answering proposals should not exceed 20 minutes, and discussion speeches should not exceed 10 minutes. This was amended to say that speeches explaining, questioning, answering, or discussing should not exceed 10 minutes. In the last article of Chapter Seven, "Voting," "If, during a meeting, a committee member present raises a question about the number of people present, and the check shows that the number is less than the quorum, no vote shall be taken," Huang Yuren questioned, believing that if there is no quorum, the meeting should be adjourned immediately, and that this article seemed unnecessary. However, Chen Yuanyuan and Wu Wangji cited Article 70 of Chapter Twelve, "Order," "Committee members who leave the meeting early shall not affect the calculation of the quorum for the meeting," to explain the drafting committee and the drafting group's concerns about Article 70 and the addition of an article in the "Voting" chapter. They stated that this provision would avoid careless voting and maintain the normal progress of meetings without resolutions. Finally, President Sun used the British Parliament as an example to explain in detail, and Huang's doubts were resolved. By this point, half of the second reading of the rules of procedure had been completed. It was time to adjourn. President Sun declared that the eighth chapter, "Exercise of the Right of Consent," had taken three hours in the morning without conclusion. The ninth chapter, "Listening to Reports and Questioning," is also extremely important. The meeting will be adjourned on the 19th because the National Assembly Hall needs to be decorated for the inauguration ceremony of the President and Vice President on the 20th. If there are no other difficulties, the second meeting will be held on the afternoon of the 20th to continue the discussion. However, since there are still more than 50 people waiting to speak, their opinions should be submitted in writing to the secretariat. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Korean Political Situation After the South Korean General Election</h3>
<p>The South Korean general election on the 10th has been completed in an atmosphere of unrest. Although the report is still being drafted, according to news reports, almost all of the eight million South Korean people participated in the voting. After inspecting various electoral districts in Seoul, Syrian representative to the United Nations Commission on Korea, Mohsin, stated, "The South Korean election has been successful. The election proceeded smoothly, and the organization was excellent." The committee is preparing to come to Shanghai to draft a report and present it to the Little General Assembly. According to US Commander in Korea, Lieutenant General Hodge, "The South Korean election is an unprecedented victory for democracy." He is confident that South Korea will complete the work of forming a government soon. Syngman Rhee himself also said, "I will order the North Korean people and the communist army to abandon the Soviet Union and return," appearing infinitely optimistic. On the other hand, however, the development of the situation in North and South Korea is still very serious. The separate election in South Korea has not brought optimistic signs, but has increased the factors of division between North and South Korea. This is a tragedy for Korea and the sorrow of the Korean people!</p>
<p>The performance of the Korean tragedy has deepened the division between North and South Korea. Moreover, this unfortunate division is bound to turn Korea into a second Greece. The current development of the political situation in North and South Korea not only shows that the divided situation is becoming more and more profound, but also shows that the Koreans, trapped between Qi and Chu, do not measure their strength, are not self-aware, and throw themselves into the net of division. Their future is very sad. A recent "Modern Historical Materials" discussion of the Korean tragedy pointed out that "The current division of Korea is not the fault of the Koreans themselves. The reason lies in the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union is willing to give up its position in Korea, thus forming a situation of division and separation. It is really difficult to operate; it will undoubtedly lead to tragic results. Not only will Korea's mountains and rivers be completely destroyed, but its situation may affect world peace. The United States and the Soviet Union know the severity of the Korean situation, but they are still willing to take a desperate gamble. Of course, what is sad is the Korean people." This is a fair view, predicting that Korea will produce tragic results, creating a cold and ruthless drama unprecedented in Korean history.</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union are well aware of the potential crisis in the Korean issue, but they are willing to take a desperate gamble. On April 30, Pyongyang Radio announced that North Korea had passed a constitution governing the entire country (including the US military occupation zone). The constitution stipulates that Seoul is the capital of the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea," but currently temporarily located in Pyongyang. The passage of the North Korean constitution and the convening of the Pyongyang meeting on the 14th fully demonstrate that the Soviet Union recognizes North Korea as an autonomous country. The Soviet Union's attitude toward the Korean issue will not be directed at the United States or South Korea, but will place responsibility for all future matters on North Korea. US Commander Hodge stated on the one hand, "The constitution was approved by the North Korean People's Committee, which is a provisional government controlled by the Communist Party in the Soviet occupation zone." He also disclosed a letter he sent to Soviet Commander Kolokov of North Korea on April 27, stating, "I do not recognize the People's Committee as the government of North Korea, nor do I wish to negotiate with the People's Committee." On the other hand, it does not hesitate to obliterate Korean public opinion and resolutely implement the separate election in South Korea. At the time of the vote on the 10th, it did not hesitate to use force to suppress the turmoil and coerce people to participate in the voting. The main participants in this South Korean election are officials of the Korean Democratic Party and the Korean National Party. Most of the other non-party and non-faction and right-wing figures are entangled with Syngman Rhee. Rhee is a pro-American figure, and Kim is an old associate of Kim Il-sung. Apart from this, no anti-Syngman Rhee faction participated. Even Kim Gu and Kim Kyu-sik did not participate in the election. Therefore, this South Korean election is a joint performance by the United States and Syngman Rhee in order to confront the Soviet Union. The political methods he displays seem to have fallen behind. Apart from Syngman Rhee himself saying "for the victory of democracy," those who look at it with a critical eye cannot help but feel deeply moved.</p>
<p>In order to restore to the Korean situation, North Korea, in order to woo right-wing and centrist factions, held a second consultation in Pyongyang on the 14th. This consultation may discuss the issue of forming a government. At the same time, North Korea threatened to cut off power supply to South Korea, not hesitating to sever relations between North and South Korea. More than 20% of South Korea's electricity relies on supply from North Korea, but South Korea has not paid for the electricity. The US military has stopped supplying electricity to North Korea, and recently dispatched two warships to Busan and Incheon, preparing to supply South Korea with electricity from warships. This step by North Korea is a major counterattack against South Korea, with significant implications, and is bound to cause a new crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union. Many people worry that the severe division between North and South Korea, and the sharp antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union, will turn from a cold war into a hot war, turning Korea into a second Greece.</p>
<p>The division of Korea, with the emergence of two governments in North and South Korea, is extremely worrying for the future of the Far East. "Modern History" discusses the Korean issue, calling for peace between the United States and the Soviet Union, and advocating:</p>
<p>(1) The United States and the Soviet Union should immediately allow Korea to become independent and conduct general elections through neutral institutions; (2) The United States and the Soviet Union should believe that the Korean people have the ability to be autonomous and should hand over power to the Korean people; or (3) The United States and the Soviet Union should, according to the Moscow Agreement, place Korea under the trusteeship of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for five years, in order to avoid direct conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although we do not fully agree with these three opinions, we agree that the United States and the Soviet Union should peacefully resolve the Korean issue in view of the seriousness of the Korean situation. At this critical moment of division and union, if Korea is not rescued from the crisis of division, the Korean people will inevitably fall into the catastrophe of war.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Committee on Compensation and Restitution of our delegation to Japan for negotiations on Japanese reparations will soon demand that Japan return 10,000 tons of copper coins, worth US$4 million, plundered in China during the war.  8,000 tons of these copper coins are in Osaka.

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Decides to Review Distribution of Compensation Machinery to Private Enterprises in Groups Due to Significant Discrepancy Between Requested and Available Quantities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Committee for the Handling of Japanese Reparations Materials under the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the allocation of Japanese reparations materials to private factories that had applied to purchase them. More than ten people, including Gu Baochang, Director of the Industrial Department, attended, with Vice Minister Tong Jiling presiding. According to a report submitted by the Industrial Department, as of the application deadline, a total of 315 private factories had applied to purchase the first batch of Japanese reparations materials, requesting a total of 10,449 machines. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs can only allocate 2,362 machines from the first batch of Japanese reparations materials to private factories. After deducting more than 700 incomplete machines, the actual number of Japanese reparations materials that can be allocated to private enterprises in the first batch is only 1,602. Among these 1,600-plus machines, only 119 crates, totaling over 1,100 machines, have arrived in Shanghai. This is more than 9,000 machines less than the quantity requested by private factories. Recently, the Receiving Committee in Japan received another batch, of which only about 200 to 300 machines can be allocated to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Including the previous batch, the difference between the number of machines requested by private factories and the number available remains significant. The discussion and review began immediately, and the following resolutions were made: (1) The applications from private factories to purchase machines will be reviewed in five groups, with three people in each group. After each group's review, a comprehensive review will be conducted. The first group will review machinery for repairing textile machines, the second group will review machinery for repairing papermaking machines, the third group will review machinery for repairing electrical appliances, the fourth group will review machinery for repairing coal mining, and the fifth group will review other machinery. (2) Preferential treatment will be given to factories that relocated inland. The Executive Yuan stipulates that one-third should be allocated at a set price. It has now been decided that one-third of each type of machine will be taken as the standard, first calculating the value and then converting it into the number of machines. (3) In accordance with Article 4 of the "Regulations on Private Enterprises Applying for the Allocation of Japanese Reparations Materials" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, detailed review rules will be formulated separately. It is understood that the results of this review work may be available by the end of next week.</p>

<h3>Fishing Season at its Peak; Pirates Active; Fenghua Fishing Boats Trapped; Xiangshan Turns Back Midway; Concerned Parties Call for Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ningbo, 18th] The fishing season along the coast of this province is mostly at the beginning of summer, especially the mid-April fishing season, which is the most prosperous. Recently, as the peak fishing season approaches, pirates have become increasingly active, with robberies and kidnappings occurring from time to time. Fenghua fishing boats have recently been surrounded by the Xu Xiaoyu gang in Daishan, who demand that the boats hand over firearms and rice and obtain flags and licenses before they can go out to sea to fish. Fishermen are unable to pay and are in a dilemma. Concerned people have gone to Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places to call for the dispatch of troops for land and sea suppression to rescue the fishing boats and maintain maritime security. Xiangshan fishing boats previously responded to Xu Xiaoyu's demands and paid four shih of rice per boat to obtain flags and licenses, hoping to go out to sea. However, they heard that the bandits still wanted to extort firearms, and fearing that they would be surrounded and unable to return once they went to sea, they decided to sacrifice the fishing season and turn back midway. The livelihood of hundreds of thousands of fishermen is a cause for concern.</p>

<h3>Arab Legion's Offensive Progresses Rapidly; The Capital of the Jewish State is Already in Sight; Jordanian, Iraqi, and Egyptian Armies Will Soon Join Forces; Jewish Quarter of the Holy Land Isolated</h3>
<p>[Reuters, with the Arab Legion near the City, correspondent Maynard, 18th] The Arab Legion of Jordan, encountering no resistance in occupying Palestine, has made rapid progress and the capital of the State of Israel, Tel Aviv, is already within sight. The Arab forces' field guns are already positioned on the mountains controlling the coastal plain. Although the strategy of the Arab regular army is strictly kept secret, judging from the current rate of progress, the Jordanian, Iraqi, and Egyptian armies may join forces in the short term. Since the three armies launched their offensive in Palestine in March, they have isolated many Jewish areas. These Jewish areas, which are already behind the Arab regular army, have been handed over to the Arab Liberation Army under Qawuqji.

<h3>Jewish Army Launches Counterattack; Occupies Acre and Attacks Lummle; Holy City of Jerusalem Surrounded Repeatedly, Becoming a Terror Hell</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 18th broadcast: Although the Jewish army occupied the Arab city of Al-Aral today, the situation of the Jews in Jerusalem is extremely critical. It is reported that the Arab armies fighting in Palestine include the armies of six countries: Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian aircraft have bombed Tel Aviv for the thirteenth time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 18th] The Haganah announced on the 18th that the Arab irregular forces trapped in the city of Acre on the northern shore of Palestine have surrendered to the Jewish army after 22 hours of fierce attacks by the Jewish army. If this is true, then the Palestinian coast from Tel Aviv to the Lebanese border, a line 80 miles long, is now under the control of the Israeli army, except for the sea lanes, which are still defended by British troops as their port of retreat.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 17th] Jewish troops launched a fierce counterattack on the 17th against the Arab town of Lummle, nine miles away, with a population of 20,000, in an attempt to open up the important highway to Jerusalem. The town of Lummle now controls the supply line for 100,000 Jews in Jerusalem. The counterattack is being led by the Irgun party, which recently joined the Jewish army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] The holy city of Jerusalem has become a terror hell. The Jewish and Arab armies have repeatedly surrounded the city, and all hope of saving the holy city has vanished. Trapped in the core are 1,340 Jews inside the Old City. 15,000 Arabs are surrounding them, using the city walls and turrets to resist the counter-surroundings by Jewish troops who are trying to break through to relieve the trapped Jews inside the city. Outside these Jewish troops, countless Arab troops are surrounding the entire city of Jerusalem, completely cutting off contact between the Jews inside and outside the Old City and the outside world. The United Nations Truce Committee for Jerusalem, composed of the consuls of the United States, France, and Belgium, together with officials from the International Red Cross, are still using telephones to contact both sides of the war to achieve a truce. The Jewish side has agreed to accept a revised truce plan to make Jerusalem a neutral city under the responsibility of the International Red Cross. However, the Arab side is still awaiting approval from their "Commander-in-Chief," King Abdullah of Jordan.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Recognizes the State of Israel; Britain Does Not Intend to Recognize it Temporarily</h3>

Radio Moscow announced that Foreign Minister Molotov, after receiving a telegram from Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok requesting all countries to recognize the State of Israel, had notified Shertok that the Soviet government had decided to officially recognize the State of Israel and its provisional government, and hoped that the establishment of the sovereign state of Israel would help promote peace and security in Palestine and the Near East.</p>

<h3>US Senators Demand the Lifting of the Arms Embargo on the Middle East</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Republicans and Democrats in the Senate unanimously approved President Truman's quick recognition of the State of Israel and demanded the lifting of the arms embargo on the State of Israel.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Political figures here believe that the fate of the State of Israel depends on two major factors: the advance of the Arab armies towards Tel Aviv and the possibility of the United States lifting the arms embargo on the Middle East. According to dispatches from Washington, President Truman summoned Secretary of State Marshall to the White House today to discuss the US government's policy of selling arms to the Israeli army. Afterwards, White House Press Secretary Ross revealed that the arms embargo on Palestine is still in effect, but it is expected that Truman and Marshall will take action soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] US officials here stated that President Truman will not take any action to lift the arms embargo on the State of Israel until the Security Council clarifies the situation in Palestine.</p>
<h3>US Atomic Energy Commissioners' Terms Extended by Two Years</h3>

The United States, Britain, China, France, Belgium, Canada, Argentina, Syria, and Colombia voted in favor, while the Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against. This vote is tantamount to the commission halting all work on atomic control, pending the General Assembly or the Security Council overturning the Atomic Energy Commission's resolution. If that happens, the United States is prepared to bring the matter before the General Assembly for a full debate.</p>
<h3>Another Soviet Peace Offensive; Washington Remains Cautious; Stalin Endorses Wallace's Proposals</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 18th] Soviet Premier Stalin's willingness to negotiate with the United States to resolve disputes has sparked speculation among officials here today that the Soviet Union is now pursuing a "peace offensive" with both diplomatic and propaganda aims. It remains to be seen whether the United States will respond and what the nature of that response will be. The White House and the State Department are maintaining silence, seeking to determine whether this is a ploy to mislead and weaken the United States, or a genuine change in policy. The U.S. needs to see clearly before taking the next step.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] An American official commented on the evening of the 17th on Stalin's public letter in response to Wallace, stating that it was an impolite action towards the head of the U.S. government and his ministers for a political leader to address a declaration on foreign policy to a foreign opposition party leader. The official also said that if such actions become commonplace, the exchange of opinions on diplomatic matters would become impossible.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 7th] Moscow Radio tonight broadcast Stalin's reply to the proposals of Wallace, the presidential candidate of the third party in the United States, stating that the Soviet Union is willing to accept Wallace's recent open letter as the basis for a peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet disputes, including in the Far East, but he does not know whether the U.S. government agrees to use Wallace's plan as the basis for a U.S.-Soviet agreement. From the perspective of the Soviet government, Wallace's plan should be a good and effective foundation for this agreement and the development of international cooperation. Stalin also compared Wallace's proposals with the letters exchanged between Smith and Molotov, saying that Smith's letters were far from adequate. It is claimed that the important significance of Wallace's open letter lies in its ability to go beyond mere words and further enumerate concrete steps for U.S.-Soviet reconciliation, which is undoubtedly the most important political document in the recent peace movement. Although Wallace's letter does not cover all the disputes between the two countries, and some of the parts he mentioned need to be improved, all these details are irrelevant at this time. What is important is that Wallace can openly and sincerely propose a concrete plan for the major premises of reconciliation on the basic disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union. Stalin also reiterated Wallace's suggestions as follows: (1) General disarmament and a ban on atomic weapons. (2) Conclude peace treaties with Germany and Japan and withdraw troops from those countries. (3) Withdraw troops from China and Korea. (4) Respect the sovereignty of all countries and do not interfere in their internal affairs. (5) No military bases should be established in the member states of the United Nations. (6) Develop international trade and assist the reconstruction of all countries within the scope of the United Nations without discrimination. (7) Maintain democracy and ensure civil rights in all countries, etc.</p>
<h3>Wallace Broadcast</h3>
<p>Suggests That He Feels That He Should Express Happiness</p>
<p>[United Press International, Oakland, California, 18th] Wallace, who is currently on a speaking tour in the San Francisco area, declared today that his open letter to Stalin objectively pointed out the location of the world crisis, and Stalin's response, immediately following the Soviet newspaper's criticism of the letter, is of great significance, indicating that the Soviet government is indeed prepared to discuss various issues and is genuinely concerned about finding a way for the United States and the Soviet Union to coexist peacefully. He hopes that Washington can adapt to the aspirations of people around the world, achieve peace, and prevent a costly and dangerous war. He hopes that the domestic newspapers will objectively treat his open letter as a basis for full discussion and resolution of domestic and foreign affairs.</p>

If the Arab side still does not comply, military intervention may be considered.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Success Lake, 17th] The United States today asked the United Nations Security Council to demand that the governments of the warring parties in Palestine issue a ceasefire order, because according to the definition of the United Nations Charter, the current situation in the Holy Land constitutes a threat to peace.

Soviet Representative Gromyko expressed support for the U.S. proposal.</p>

<h3>Other Solutions to the City's Housing Shortage; Ministry of Finance Does Not Allow Restoration of Real Estate as Loan Collateral; China Trust Bureau Plans to Build and Sell Houses</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Municipal Council has repeatedly suggested to the central government that real estate be used as bank loan collateral to stimulate land finance and encourage housing construction to alleviate the housing shortage, but this has not been adopted. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the Council's fifth general meeting resolution, which has been forwarded to the municipal government, stating: "The Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to quickly restore real estate as bank loan collateral and order national banks to handle real estate mortgage transfers is difficult to implement due to the limited funds of national banks. It is requested that it be temporarily handled according to current regulations. However, in order to encourage housing construction and solve the housing shortage, this year the China Farmers Bank has approved the handling of city land improvement loans (including housing construction loans) in major cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and the bank is currently preparing a loan implementation plan. In addition, the China Trust Bureau, in view of the failure of past construction loans to quickly solve the housing shortage, plans to purchase land and build its own houses for sale by bidding. The principles for handling this are also being negotiated with the Ministry of Land Affairs for approval. This should help solve the current housing shortage."</p>
<h3>Prevent Hoarding and Smuggling to Aid Communists; Shanghai Rice Is Not Allowed to Leave the City; Non-Grain Merchants Are Not Allowed to Purchase and Hoard Rice; Endorsement Is Required After Each Transaction</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Executive Yuan believes that this city is the largest consumer city in the country, and the full-scale distribution of food has already begun. In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from hoarding and smuggling rationed rice to aid the communists, and to crack down on speculation and manipulation to stabilize people's livelihood, it has specially formulated measures and instructed the municipal government to strictly comply with them. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) Shanghai rice is not allowed to be transported out of the urban area. The government should, in conjunction with the Garrison Headquarters, issue a notice to the public to comply with it, and select cadres to strictly investigate and prohibit it in conjunction with the military police. Anyone who privately transports rice out of the country will be punished in accordance with Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Those Who Hinder National Mobilization. At the same time, the Executive Yuan will separately order customs and transportation agencies to strictly enforce it to prevent food from flowing out, so as to prevent hoarding and smuggling. (2) The management of the Shanghai grain market should be strengthened immediately. It should be stipulated that buying and selling should be conducted publicly in the market. Non-grain merchants are not allowed to purchase and hoard rice. Transactions must be conducted with cash on delivery. The quantity and purpose of the transaction should be registered in detail by the market management office. The quantity of grain stored by grain merchants and warehouses should be reported daily. (3) It is reported that the Shanghai grain market mostly uses warehouse receipts (or bills of lading) to buy and sell repeatedly, driving up grain prices and using grain as an object of speculative funds, causing grain prices to soar. This speculative trend is the main reason. It should be clearly stipulated that if warehouse receipts (or bills of lading) are used for transactions, they must be addressed, and the bill of lading must be endorsed after the transaction. Repeated buying and selling is not allowed, and the market manager is responsible for strict enforcement.</p>

Subsequently, the cinema industry association held a meeting of directors and supervisors, believing that the 20% increase was too small and could not make up for expenses, so it immediately decided to comply with the authorities' regulations for the lowest ticket price, only increasing it by 20%, while the rest would be automatically adjusted. The highest ticket price of 200,000 yuan has increased by 66% compared to the previous 120,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>A Two-Year-Old Child Is Addicted to Smoking; Comfortable with a Cigarette in Hand; Smoke Comes Out of the Nostrils; Protruding Abdomen Suspected of Having Worms</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The sensational news of the Sichuan woman Yang Mei's "not eating" has recently aroused the interest of the medical community in the province and is being studied and observed in preliminary stages. Now, according to this newspaper's reporter, there is a child in this city who is under three years old who does not like toys or candy, but whose only hobby is smoking cigarettes. With a cigarette in hand, he is comfortable, which, like Yang Mei's not eating, is a strange thing. Liu Jinnian, 26 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, fled to Shanghai with his wife, Liu Bai, and son, Yizhong, last year in the second lunar month because his hometown was harassed by bandits and his parents and brothers were killed. He makes a living by rowing a boat to transport soybean stalks and straw between Sijing and Shanghai. On the 28th of last month, Liu Bai suddenly fell ill with a disease and was sent to a hospital on Xizang Road for treatment. Liu sold his boat due to financial constraints and stayed in the hospital with his son Yizhong to accompany and take care of his wife. Unexpectedly, after Liu's son was admitted to the hospital, whenever he cried, his father would ask people for cigarettes for him to smoke, and he could turn his sorrow into joy. For a time, the whole hospital was talking about this strange thing. This reporter met Liu Jinnian at the hospital yesterday. He is an extremely simple countryman. According to him, neither he nor his wife like to smoke. Last year in the fourth lunar month, his son Yizhong happened to be crying non-stop. A friend happened to be smoking in the boat and carelessly gave him the cigarette to play with in order to stop him from crying. Unexpectedly, after Yizhong got the cigarette, he was able to swallow and spit freely, without any spicy or irritating feeling. From then on, whenever he cried, he would use cigarettes instead of toys and candy to stop him from crying, and he gradually became accustomed to it. Now he needs to smoke about three cigarettes a day. At this point in the conversation, the teahouse in the hospital gave the child a cigarette. He was able to hold the cigarette with two fingers on his right hand, and after taking a few puffs, the smoke came out of his nostrils. His skillful posture was surprising. The child is now three years old, but his actual age will be three years old on the 16th day of the sixth lunar month of this year. He can only say "Mommy" and cannot speak. He looks no different from ordinary people, but his face is sallow and he has two small braids on the side of his head. His expression is very dull. The child was once examined by a doctor in the hospital, and the results showed that his abdomen was protruding, which may be due to worms. However, it is impossible to understand why he can smoke cigarettes.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] A young man named Yao Huizhong, residing at No. 76, Lane 1423, Yuyuan Road, went to Zhongshan Park for a walk with his girlfriend, Lu Xiuqing, and a Mr. Ma around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. Suddenly, a man named Xu Chunbo, accompanied by two others, approached and began to harass Lu and Ma. Yao sternly rebuked them, leading to a verbal altercation.

<h3>The Town Leader of Datuan Township Defects with Weapons, Escorting Self-Defense Corps Members and Soldiers into the Sea, the Garrison Headquarters Telephones the Youth Army and Transfers Troops to Be Stationed to Search</h3>
<p>Chu Guibin, the leader of Datuan Town in Nanhui, Pudong, was recently incited by Communist bandits. On the evening of the 15th of this month at 8:00 PM, he defected along with Xi Dexiang, the head of the self-defense force, leading more than ten subordinates. In addition to taking all the firearms from the town's self-defense force, they also confiscated the firearms of the self-defense forces and police from Nicheng and Machang Townships. The firearms taken included one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, more than twenty carbines, more than seventy rifles, and more than forty handguns. They went out to the Sanzaogang sea port, took a boat, and sneaked off to Siming Island outside Jinshankou, a bandit area.</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, the local villagers and the police station immediately telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. After receiving the report, the garrison immediately telegraphed the 202nd Division of the Youth Army to urgently dispatch a company of stationed troops to the town that night for stationing, strict vigilance, and searching. Furthermore, in order to avoid affecting the security of the garrison area, it has dispatched a large number of cadres to conduct a detailed investigation and research into the inside story of the case. Now that the Youth Army has been stationed in the town, it has returned to normal, and the position of town leader is temporarily being held concurrently by the police chief, it is said.</p>
<p>It is reported that Chu Guibin, who defected this time, was originally an old subordinate of the communist bandit Ding Xishan. He was a native of Laogang Town on the coast of Nanhui. During the war, he organized a guerrilla team and became acquainted with Ding, joining Ding's troops as a battalion commander. In 1944, when Ding Xishan surrendered to the enemy and became a puppet, Chu was unwilling to go along with him and secretly went to the mainland alone. He underwent training for a year and then was ordered to return to Nanhui to take charge of subversion work. After the victory, he was ordered to take the position of town leader of Datuan Town, which he held until now. This spring, when Ding Xishan was beheaded in Qingpu County, Chu secretly shed tears. The authorities feared that he would change, so they had taken precautions early, but this defection still occurred.</p>

Mayor Wu first delivered a speech expressing two thoughts: (1) When the charity house lottery tickets were first issued, some citizens did not trust them. Today, the winners are here, and after inspection and acceptance by representatives of the Municipal Assembly, it proves that the construction of the houses fully complies with the specifications, and there has been no cutting corners or reducing materials. This is the government showing great trust to the people and expressing credibility to the people. (2) When the groundbreaking ceremony was held here five months ago, it was still a wasteland. Now, several months later, the houses have been built, which shows that as long as people do things, no matter what it is, as long as we work together and are not afraid of difficulties, we can do it, and all difficulties can be overcome.</p>
<p>Gaining Trust from the People Achieves Success</p>
<p>After the lottery for the first phase of charity houses was completed, I received over one hundred letters from citizens suggesting improvements to the charity houses and hoping to continue holding them. The Municipal Government has now decided to continue to do so. Because citizens already have trust in the government, I believe that greater success can be achieved in the future. The mayor expressed his gratitude to Wang Xianqing, the Industry Public Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Construction Industry Public Association, the Central Bank, the Municipal Bank, the various bureaus of the Municipal Government, and all sectors for their assistance in proposing the event. At the same time, he also congratulated the winners of each house.</p>

After Lai Bao, the Jiangsu Supervisory Iron Envoy, and Pan Zhuang delivered their speeches,</p>
<h3>Winner Representative Delivers a Speech of Thanks</h3>
<p>Yan of Defeng Yarn Factory and Ni Changqi, the lottery winners from Group A Hongzi, delivered a speech of thanks on behalf of the charity house winners, stating that as tenants in Shanghai, they had suffered the pain of exploitation. Yan himself studied medicine, but could not fulfill his ambitions because he had no clinic. Now, they were fortunate enough to win the lottery, solving their housing shortage, and the houses were all sturdy and beautiful. This was all due to the design, supervision, and guidance of the Winter Relief Society, and the assistance of all sectors, which made this achievement possible. On behalf of all the winners, he bowed to the mayor and the leaders of various organizations to express his gratitude. After the speech, Mayor Wu handed over the certificate to Wang Xianqing, the director of the charity sale department. The whole group took a photo, and the ceremony ended.

<h3>Dr. Hou Yun and His Wife's Mutual Accusation Case Becomes Increasingly Complex</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The marital dispute between Hou Yunqing, a famous pulmonologist in this city, and his wife Zhuang Min, has been going on since the beginning of the War of Resistance and has not yet been resolved. Hou and Zhuang separated long ago, and Zhuang served in the puppet Health Bureau during the enemy-puppet period and continued to hold her position after the victory. Hou and Zhuang Min did not complete the divorce procedures, and Hou married Fang Cailin in Jiading, and Zhuang accused him of bigamy to the District Prosecutor's Office, and was prosecuted for adultery, and was heard in the Criminal Court of the District Court, and has not yet been concluded. Hou suddenly accused Zhuang of being a pro-Japanese traitor the other day, and the High Prosecutor's Office summoned Zhuang for questioning yesterday, and released her on bail. Hou's complaint stated: After Shanghai was occupied, Hou practiced medicine in Shanghai. At that time, Xu Yangzhong, a staff officer of the puppet 13th Division, was an underground worker who was detected by the enemy and puppet, and escaped to Hou's place, and Hou sheltered him and left Shanghai. Only Zhuang knew about this, and used this to blackmail him. Later, Zhuang swept away and went away, and once instigated the enemy's highest advisor, Kageyama, to send a special letter to warn him. Then he reported to the puppet police chief, Ying, and Hou was detained in the puppet police station for a week. Zhuang also had a close relationship with the puppet health director, Ni Yuchang, etc. According to Zhuang, she claimed in court that during the occupation of Shanghai, Hou had close ties with No. 76, and was forced to separate, and was forced to work in the puppet health bureau for a living. After the victory, the assessment was still hired. As for Kageyama's letter, he said he did not know. The development between this pair of resentful couples seems to have become more and more complex.</p>

<h3>The Export Management Committee Responds to the Demands of the Silk Industry to Ration Raw Silk to Factories, the Central Bank Allocates Two Hundred Loads of Silk for Trial Implementation</h3>
<p>The Export Management Committee recently learned of the request from the silk weaving industry for the government to allocate raw silk as raw materials, so as to weave silk products for export in exchange for foreign exchange. After repeated consultations with relevant parties such as the Central Bank and China Trust Bureau, a method for implementation has now been decided. The Central Bank will first allocate two hundred loads of silk from the existing silk for trial sales. The price is set at US$3.5 per pound, with reference to the international market price of raw silk. Any silk weaving factory that intends to export its products overseas can apply to the Export Management Committee for the allocation of the required raw silk materials. After the Export Management Committee approves the quantity to be allocated, it will notify the Central Bank to allocate it according to the above price. The allocation methods are divided into: (1) Allocation based on the foreign exchange settlement certificate issued by the designated bank. (2) Allocation based on an irrevocable letter of credit (Irrevocable L/C Without Recourse), but the export of silk fabrics is limited to 60 days. If necessary, it can be extended to 90 days. (3) Anyone who has an order form and wants to receive raw silk materials in advance must provide full security for the silk pieces before allocation can be approved, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Trend Upward Again; Wheat Flour Firm, Coarse Grains Prosper</h3>
<p>The rice market is experiencing a gradual increase. Due to the firm price levels in the production area of Wuxi, holders' intentions have become more resolute. Coupled with excellent actual sales in the local market, with limited outflows and increased inflows, prices have risen accordingly. In the northern market, Bai Geng rice increased by 150,000, while Bo Dao rice rose by 250,000, both opening at 5,660,000. Xian rice and other varieties uniformly increased by 150,000. In the southern market, all grades of Geng and Xian rice also rose by 150,000 to 200,000 across the board. Market quotation sheets are 200,000 lower than market prices. Yesterday, registered cargo arrivals totaled 4,907 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Slightly rebounded in price. Because the mainland price did not fall, and the rice market rose, morale improved. Merchants all had the intention to raise prices from low levels, so the market prospered. Retail investors also took the opportunity to buy in short positions. Lao Che and Bing Chuan both closed at 1,830,000, Hong Feng and Jian Cheng both at 1,800,000, each higher than the previous day by 30,000. The Central Trust Bureau continues to jointly sell off with various factories, with the price still at 1,800,000. Because the market price has already risen, buyers are eager, with 12,500 bags sold. Bran, dumped by the Dongyang gang, fell by 40,000 to 50,000 alone, while the original price of wheat remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains</p>
<p>Continued to show strength. Since the increase in foreign exchange rates, morale has remained firm. In addition, the reported increase in rice prices further encouraged merchants to raise prices. Soybeans finally rose by 100,000 due to absorption by oil factories. Hankou Zha Dou was quoted at 3,000,000. Green beans were stable. Corn inventories were scarce, and Qingdao buyers pushed prices up by 250,000. Red sorghum continued to add 100,000 due to increased purchases by distilleries. Jian Qing was flat and weak. Sesame increased by 400,000, and raw peanuts were in demand by the Guangdong gang, rising by 500,000 to 600,000.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Appeared hesitant. Soybean oil opened steadily, with Datong and Tongfeng opening at 12,700,000. Subsequently, Dayou and Dachang new soybean oil rose to a high of 13,000,000. However, Zhongzhi Factory opened raw vegetable oil at a price of 12,200,000 as much as possible, thus preventing soybean oil from rising further. As a result, prices rose slightly by 100,000 to 200,000. Raw oil increased by 200,000 in the early market, but downstream Qing oil and other oils only fluctuated by 100,000 to 200,000 near the close. Xiao Jun sesame oil alone rose by 500,000. Soybean cake was mostly traded by retail investors. Chang Zi Cake Factory opened at 1,400,000, recovered to 1,390,000, and increased by 50,000 due to compression.</p>

<h3>Self-Funded Students at Jiaotong University Unable to Pay Meal Fees</h3>
<p>Delegates Sent to Beijing to Petition the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Also Requesting the University to Quickly Find Ways to Provide Relief</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than 250 self-funded students at Jiaotong University, due to the cessation of their sources of income, have not paid the meal fees due this month. The dining services have notified them that meals will be suspended. Delegates Yuan Guochang and Liu Guangyu were specially sent to Beijing the night before last to petition the Ministry of Education. This morning, they also invited the Dean of Academic Affairs, Zhou Ming, and the Dean of General Affairs, Cai Ze, of the university for a discussion on the lawn of the campus, requesting the university to quickly find ways to provide relief. Zhou and Cai explained the university's financial difficulties to the point of exhaustion, and stated that since President Cheng Xiaogang was in Beijing and had not returned, they were unable to grant long-term advances. In the end, Dean Zhou agreed in his personal capacity to transfer 30 million yuan from outside to solve the temporary difficulties. He also notified President Cheng Xiaogang in Beijing by long-distance telephone, requesting him to consult with the Ministry of Education in Beijing to find a solution. According to Dean Cai, there are more than 1,200 self-funded and partially self-funded students at the university. Previously, 400 students were registered as having their sources of income cut off and needing public funding for relief. 250 students have not yet paid their fees this month.

<h3>Spring Rain Night Talk</h3>
<p>— Yuqin</p>
<p>"I have never seen the head of the rain. Maybe the rain really has no head? No, the rain has a head. But the head is very high. To see it is not the eye fortune that you and I mortals can casually enjoy. However, the feet of the rain are not difficult to see. I often see it, and I have also heard others talk about it. In an old poem, I still remember the sentences 'The feet of the rain come from the southeast' and 'The wind drives the feet of the rain back.' You have read Li Bai's poems, you should still remember his: 'White rain reflects the cold mountain, dense like silver bamboo'; isn't the silver bamboo he wrote about the rain feet I'm talking about?"</p>
<p>"Rain not only has a head and feet, but also has a temperament. What is the innate temperament of rain? From large, small, rapid, and slow, to divide: 'pouring rain' and 'silk-like drizzle' should be the expression of two kinds of temperaments, violent and gentle. In time, the former is mostly fierce in its arrival, and does not last long; the latter is mostly slow in coming, and continuous and endless. One is tyrannical and barbaric; the other is peaceful. It can also be said that one is masculine; the other is feminine and beautiful."</p>
<p>"You know, in the summer there is 'plum rain.' That is exactly what the poet said: 'In April, the weather is hot and muggy, and bitter rain first enters the plum.' Summer rain is regarded as bitter rain, perhaps because it is not as popular as wind; and it falls towards the heart of sour plums. 'Wutong rain' is even more frequently chanted by poets: 'Falling paulownia leaves in the rain,' 'Autumn rain when paulownia leaves fall,' these always carry a little so-called sense of autumn sadness. Winter rain should be called 'winter plum rain.' Because it is a full expression of tyrannical and barbaric temperament, there seem to be fewer poems chanting it, such as 'Rain connects with the dawn, falling on the remaining plums' are few and far between. Spring rain, it can be different from these. In the Song of Everlasting Regret, isn't there the sentence 'Jade face lonely, tear-stained railing, a pear blossom branch brings spring rain'? Pear blossoms with rain, here, have become the jade face of a beauty leaning on the railing and shedding tears. This sentence explains why Wang Huan overthrew the country, and also explains why pear blossoms are so beautiful and so endearing in the spring rain. What kind of rain is spring rain? What is the temperament of this kind of rain? What are the poet's feelings about this temperament? You should know."</p>
<p>"Night rain is a qin, playing a desolate tune alone in the high mountains and valleys. Look, aren't the rain threads the strings of the qin? Aren't the dripping sounds of rain the tunes played on the strings? 'The thick strings are noisy like rapid rain, the thin strings are soft like private whispers,' the varying degrees of loudness and softness and rapidity and slowness, aren't they variations of Gong and Shang? And you and I, aren't we the listeners of the qin heart?"</p>
<p>"Listening to the rain seems to be a very elegant term, especially on rainy nights, because of the stillness, it is easy to generate elegant interest. 'Lying down and listening to the sparse rain on the paulownia,' what a picturesque sentence! Also, those who like to 'keep the withered lotus to listen to the sound of rain' and regret 'not planting banana trees to listen to the rain,' how sad their moods must be!"</p>
<p>"Really, if the rain doesn't fall, you don't talk about it; once it falls, it is inevitable that you will. Once you listen to it, your mood seems to be grasped by it, making people think of many things that you usually don't have time to think about. 'The west window blows dark rain again,' can you stop your heart from listening? After listening, like the echo in an empty valley, your heart will definitely have a reaction. If you don't think of the long-torn calendar, then you plan for the things at hand or future hopes; this is inward thinking; what about outward thinking? There are really many, friends far away, do you still remember your childhood classmates? Lovers in red buildings, is your spring dream good? White hair in your hometown, shouldn't you be too burdened by family expenses..."</p>
<p>"You must be thinking, but I don't know what you're thinking about? Facing the 'Quietly locking a courtyard of sad rain, scattering the empty steps, the night orchid has not rested' tonight, although we do not have 'old friends cutting candles by the west window in the rain,' but are 're-invited to sleep listening to the rain,' since you are already listening to the rain, can you still not think?"</p>
<p>"I didn't think; no, I was thinking. But what I think about is not much, and what I can think about is what I want to think about. Who is that? It's neither a relative, nor a lover, nor a friend; but it's also a mother, a lover, a friend, it's all my dear, broad humanity. In this 'Chongqing merciless wind and rain' night, there must be many different people getting through it in different ways, but among many different people, those who are most unable to get through it and can't help but get through it are the people in low and dilapidated thatched huts, the kind of Du Fu's bitter situation in those years where 'there is no dry place on the bed due to the leaking roof, and the feet of the rain are like hemp and never stop,' must have been deeply savored, but you and I are lying comfortably in bed! Alas, lying comfortably in bed!"</p>
<p>Like an arrow, deeply shot into my lungs; like a lead stone, heavily pressed on my friend's heart. The rain is good, the spring night rain is especially good, but why would my friend and I, who are talking to each other in bed, 'hear the rain and spoil the spring dream'?</p>

<h3>Quick Chat After Watching a Play</h3>
<p>— Li Puyuan</p>
<p>I missed the reception for "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain," written by Li Hongxin and directed by Hong Shen, the day before yesterday. Yesterday, thanks to the kindness of Mr. Lu Fuguang, a member of the play's production committee, I had the opportunity to watch the first act as a preview.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Hongxin lives with me, and I have been following the rehearsals of "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain" with great interest; moreover, I have always hoped that it would be staged soon, giving a fresh and powerful stimulus to this Shanghai life that has become utterly decadent.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "quick" in this "preview" is quite "unconventional"!</p>
<p>In fact, both "seeing" and "talking" about it are enjoyable.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Hongxin is a "slender and spirited" person. When I first met him, I only thought he was dark but handsome. His first work, "The Child Who Couldn't Be Given Away," was a lively and vivid one-act play. I never imagined that his "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain," now on stage, would have such profound depth and such grand ambition.</p>
<p>This play uses the character of Yang Wenhua, a middle school student, to represent the playwright's attitude, and uses various appropriate opportunities to declare the theme of the play. The theme is: the Han and Yi are one family, they should be equal, they should love each other, they should unite, they should not be suspicious of each other, and they should not hate each other because of their respective senses of superiority. This theme, in the current stage when all aspects of the country are seeking to promote the unity and welfare of the entire nation from various perspectives, is very correct and very worthy of cherishing; in my opinion, however, this spirit of engaging in the cultural and blood exchange between the borderlands and the Central Plains, between the majority and minority compatriots, is especially worthy of great praise. Without face-to-face contact with our minority compatriots in the borderlands, we Han people cannot avoid sitting in a well and looking at the sky, cannot avoid being self-important and arrogant. When we are face-to-face with these compatriots, we feel weak, we feel fragile, we feel that both our nerves and blood are aging, we feel that our suspiciousness, suspicion, and infighting… are self-inflicted troubles, self-inflicted decline, and are so petty that they are not even worth a smile! Indeed, the burden that society has handed over to us is heavy enough to carry, but to carry this burden requires broader shoulders, greater courage, fresher blood, and stronger vitality… These things are almost impossible to find in our current life, but there is plenty of them in the borderlands among our minority compatriots! To say nothing else, just looking at this performance of "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain," three hours of work, a dose of what Mencius called "the spirit of vastness and rectitude," I believe, will greatly inspire our lives! The theme of this play is good, and the ambition is even better!</p>
<p>The structure of this play arranges the "grudges" and "gratitude" very clearly in the introduction of the first act. The subsequent development is not diluted by the grand scenes of singing, dancing, fighting, and jumping through fire… The main thread is still proceeding step by step, forcing out the tragic outcome of five lives in a tumultuous manner; Mr. Hong Qianzai also always grasps the playwright's requirements, and handles the overall rhythm of the movements very appropriately; not to mention the sets, lighting, and costumes, which are generally consistent with the playwright's intentions, even the acting skills of the actors, Jiajia, Wushake, Shanlana, Yameng, Su…, are also competent and enjoyable—if I had to depict a bit of shadow, I think, we are Han people after all, our bodies are not strong enough, and our vitality is not sufficient enough!</p>
<p>However, these are ultimately minor details, aren't they? If we had more plays like this, more practice, then "human effort" can ultimately "overcome the grand," can't it?</p>
<h3>Suzhou Confucian Temple (Oil Painting)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziyu</p>
<h3>Calais Beach</h3>
<p>— By English poet William Wordsworth, translated by Zhen Qin</p>
<p>It is a beautiful evening, a quiet, clear, and sacred time, as silent as a nun holding her breath in prayer; the vast sun is gradually setting in its tranquility; the great mercy of the heavens reigns over the sea: Hark! The great "Life" is awakening, using its eternal rhythm to emit a thunderous sound—unchanging throughout the ages. Dear girl accompanying me! If you seem not to touch sacred thoughts, your nature will not therefore be less noble: you lie all year round in Abraham's bosom, worshipping and praising in the inner temple, God watches over you, but we do not know.</p>
<p>[William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was an early and well-known English Romantic poet. This sonnet is one of the poet's masterpieces, written in Calais in 1802 and first published in the 1807 collection "Poems," with no title in the original. "Clear" in the first line, originally free, can be interpreted as free from clouds according to Wheeler. "Life" in the sixth line refers to the sea. The allusion used in the twelfth line can be found in Luke 16:22, where Lazarus lies in Abraham's bosom; but it usually refers to the dead.—Translator]</p>
<h3>Wang Anshi's Diary</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, diary writing gradually flourished, and many authors emerged. Such as Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang, Zeng Bu, Zhao Bian, Zhang Shunmin, Huang Tingjian, Zhou Hui, Zhou Mi, Lu You, Fan Chengda, Cheng Zhuo, Zhou Bida, Huang Ji, Zou Shen, Zhao Gai, Zhang Fangping and others, all personally wrote diaries. Now, those who have seen their books or have their titles preserved are no less than dozens of families.</p>
<p>Wang Anshi's diary, with its vast number of volumes, is the crown of all the diaries of the Yan Song Dynasty, and few people have evaluated it. I will briefly describe it as follows, despite the expense of words. Anshi assisted Emperor Shenzong, famous for advocating new laws, and was posthumously named Wen and posthumously enfeoffed as Prince Shu in the early years of Shaosheng. His life deeds are detailed in the History of Song, Volume 326, Biography 86. According to the diary, it has now been lost; the number of volumes recorded in historical records also varies. The Art and Literature Chronicle of the History of Song states twelve volumes, Zhou Hui's Qingbo Miscellany says eighty volumes, and Zhao Delin's Houminglu says seventy volumes. It is likely that Hui was a person of the Southern Song Dynasty, only about fifty years away from the beginning of Xining; what Hui saw was naturally the complete volume. What Zhao saw may have been another copy. And what the History of Song says seems to be a fragment, which is also unknown. In short, according to the books of Zhou and Zhao, what Jinggong recorded was mostly criticisms of those who did not attach themselves to him. His personality was stubborn and he spared no detail. It is said that Cai Tiao's Northern Hunt Record of the Song Dynasty stated that Emperor Huizong never forgot his late father Emperor Shenzong's ambition to continue his legacy. When someone happened to sell Wang Anshi's diary, he happily exchanged it for ten bolts of silk. (See General Catalogue of the Complete Library of the Four Treasures)</p>
<h3>Recent World Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Czech Literary Evening</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Foreign Literature Library and the Slavic Association in Moscow jointly held a Czech literary evening. The program included recitations of Czech poetry and prose in Russian translation, as well as talks on the development of Czech literature. The library also exhibited Slavic literature translated into Russian, including works by writers from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>It began with a speech by Alexander Fadeyev, Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union. He spoke of the traditions of Czech literature, the close relationship between Russian culture and the Slavic peoples, and Fadeyev emphasized that both countries are close to the masses and have a spirit of freedom and lofty humanity. Speaking of mutual influence and the relationship with Western literature, Fadeyev said that Russian literature in the nineteenth century, especially after the time of the poet Zhukovsky, no longer relied on Western culture. Russian literature has long held an important place in world literature. Czech literature, after Wrkhlitski, no longer needs to rely on Western culture. The narrator added that, on the contrary, Western Europe still needs to learn from the Slavic peoples.</p>
<p>The audience warmly welcomed the Czech female writer J. Glazarova. She spoke of the influence of Russian literature on Czech literature, and that there are many translations of Soviet writers' works in Czech. She also said that there are many Czech writers' works translated into Soviet languages, for which she is very grateful.</p>
<p>Glazarova also spoke of the period of Hitler's terrifying occupation. The Nazi Party wanted to drive out Czech culture. Among those who sacrificed under Nazi bestiality were: journalist and literary scholar Julius Fucik, Joseph Capek (brother of Karel Capek), novelist Vladislav Vancura (who wrote the novel "Jan Margoul the Baker," initially called the Czech "Don Quixote"), poet and translator of Russian poetry Joseph Hora, famous humorist Karl Polak, famous writer and Nazi resistance fighter Jaroslav Kratohvil, and others. But Czech culture will not perish. The writers of the old era have been replaced by young writers who emerged during and after the war, including: Ivan Olbraht, a psychoanalytic novelist, female writer Maria Majerova, who wrote several novels about workers' struggles, and others such as Anna-Marie Tilsova and Stanislav Nenman.</p>
<p>Death of French Writer Jean-Richard Bloch</p>
<p>The famous French writer and anti-Nazi Jean-Richard Bloch has recently passed away. The Soviet "Literaturnaya Gazeta" published this news. The Soviet Writers' Union published a eulogy: "For many years, Bloch was a friend of our country and culture." When the Spanish people opposed Hitler's henchman Franco, Bloch was the first to go to Spain.</p>
<p>This anti-fascist writer left his homeland during the war and lived in the Soviet Union. Soviet writers still remember his anti-Nazi speeches. Thousands of underground French workers listened to his radio broadcasts. He broadcast from Moscow, praising the Soviet people's resistance to German aggression and encouraging his countrymen to learn from the Soviet Union and fight the invaders to the end.</p>
<p>Bloch returned to France with the dual qualifications of writer and anti-fascist. The eulogy said: "France's post-war democracy owes much to Bloch's courageous and sincere voice.</p>
<p>"We, his Soviet readers and friends, will always remember Bloch's moving personality, his selfless diligence and optimism, and his unwavering commitment to his responsibilities as a writer and fighter, even in the most difficult times."</p>
<p>The Soviet Writers' Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the editors-in-chief of "Soviet Literature" and "Literaturnaya Gazeta" have sent letters of condolence to the family, friends, and colleagues of the deceased.</p>

<h3>A Collection of Letters Seeking Jobs and Financial Aid</h3>
<p>(1) Editor: I am a third-year student at Jiaotong University who has returned from the inland. Many students have probably told you about our living conditions and difficulties. Indeed, we have reached the end of our rope. Therefore, I hope to be able to take on a job such as a tutor during my spare time. I have long admired your willingness to help those in need, and I pray that you will publish this in your newspaper. Thank you very much. Zhong Xianzheng (Room 330, Jiaotong University, Xujiahui)</p>
<p>(2) Editor: I am a poor student at Jiaotong University. I was admitted to a national university and also received public funding. In the eyes of most people, I am already a star in heaven. However, my presence among the stars may tarnish heaven! My father is a small civil servant, and his monthly income cannot support a "family of seven." Where would he get the money for his children's education? In the past, I relied entirely on work-study grants from the student relief association to support myself. However, the work-study program has not paid out in more than two months. The cut off of economic resources has left me at a dead end. Although I only have fourteen months left to graduate, the current difficulties are still difficult to overcome. Fortunately, I still study hard on weekdays, and I believe I still have an interest in English. I sincerely hope to take on a job as an English teacher at a night school or as a tutor to maintain my studies. Sincerely, Wu Hengshun, third-year student at Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>(3) Editor: Ten years of wandering, I don't know how many stops. My home has been destroyed by the flames of war, and my source of income has been cut off. I often think of working and studying, but I have not been able to find a way. The pain of interrupted studies is imminent. Sir, do you also sympathize with me? I am currently studying at Jiaotong University as a third-year student. I am willing to work as a tutor for students in elementary or middle school. I pray for your help. Sincerely, Wang Chaodian (Room 308, Zhongyuan, Jiaotong University)</p>

<h3>The Sorrow of Old Age</h3>
<p>— Mao Zishui</p>
<p>The difference between humans and other higher animals, or the difference between people with higher culture and people with lower culture, is of course many. The easiest to see is in the ability and degree of "reflection." Reflection is the recollection of past behavior and the identification of their right and wrong, good and evil. (Needless to say, the so-called right and wrong, good and evil here are naturally based on the interests of the entire human race as the standard.) Reflection seems to be the greatest driving force for human cultural progress. I believe that the distinction between "upper-class people" and "lower-class people" should not be based on the height of their status or the difference in their occupations, but should be based on the degree of their reflection. Among the people Confucius admired most in his life, there was Qu Boyu. Legend has it that Qu Boyu did not realize the errors of his past behavior until he was fifty years old. This of course refers to the right and wrong, good and evil in the ethical sense. If we take the ordinary meaning, for example, if a person writes a word wrong or plays a card wrong, he can immediately realize it, so why wait until after his fiftieth birthday? I think Confucius admired Qu Boyu because he had this ability to reflect.</p>
<p>But reflection can give us great distress! If a person lives his whole life in a muddle-headed way, then there is nothing to say. If he has some ability to reflect, then when he gets older and his mind gradually becomes clearer (this idea may arise from the unfounded self-esteem of an old man), he will definitely feel "regret" for his past mistakes. "Regret" is certainly a good thing; "irreversible" is the most distressing. No matter how small a thing is, as long as it has happened, it will leave an indelible mark. Of course, if a person knows his mistakes and is able to resolutely correct them, he can not only remedy the past, but also create a new life. The sages of the past said: "To err and not to correct is to err indeed!" "All things past are like yesterday's death; all things to come are like today's birth." These words are the most appropriate and useful instructions for human behavior. Unfortunately, this realization of one's own faults often comes very late. Qu Boyu's story may have been fabricated by the ancients to encourage people, but a thoughtful person will of course be more able to know his own faults as he gets older. To know one's faults and be able to correct them is naturally a kind of happiness in life. But "the sunset is infinitely beautiful, but it is near dusk." I think there must be many old people in the world who have this sorrow.</p>
<p>Young people are different. If a young person can realize his faults early and correct them early, this "irreversible" regret will not only be less than that of an old man, but may even be non-existent. In this sense, the true distress in the world belongs only to old people, and young people should never have it.</p>
<p>This is still speaking from a negative point of view. If we speak from a positive point of view, we can even more clearly show this truth. The story of Zhou Chu in the Jin Dynasty is truly a "youth" story, which old people would probably not be able to do. It is distressing for a person to regret the past, and it is also a most distressing thing for a person to look forward to the future and feel "powerless" and "sigh at the vastness of the ocean"! Young people, on the other hand, have "a long way to go." As long as they work hard to do good things, "nothing is difficult in the world," and they will not end up achieving nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that as far as human behavior is concerned, only old people have distress, and young people should not have distress. As for worldly human feelings, old people are aging and ugly, and they are annoying everywhere. Young people are not so. This is also a special distress for old people. I will not go into detail, because I am afraid it will cause too much sadness to my "peers"!</p>
<p>A good person always hopes that the world will get better day by day, and that human beings will be happier day by day. Therefore, good old people all hope that the young people in the world will take them—the old people—as a lesson, be able to "reflect" early, and move forward on the bright road. If there is anything in this world that can dispel the distress of old people, it is this hope. If the young people in the world make this hope more and more distant, then thoughtful old people will definitely feel the greatest distress!</p>
<h3>Famous Clown Liu Gansan</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Dr. Mei has been performing here in recent years. The first play is always "Female Escort," and the person who plays Chong Gongdao with him used to be written as Xiao Changhua. This time, he is performing at the Tianchan Theater and has been changed to Ru Fuhui. Probably Ershun (Xiao's nickname) is too old and cannot come again. Famous clowns in Peking opera are gradually declining. There are many plays that cannot be paired with good clowns, and even the famous sheng and dan are diminished in color.</p>
<p>I went to the old capital to study at the age of eighteen, which was in the 30th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. I still got to see Luo Baisui, who played Jiang Gan in "Heroes' Meeting" and Laoqie in "Heaven's Retribution" very well. His signature plays were "Ronghua Ji," "Twelve Reds," and "Wang Daoshi Captures the Demon," and those who watched it were amazed. However, the older generation said that Baisui was not as good as Liu Gansan. Although the two people's performance styles are different, there must be differences in the level of their cold and vivid performances.</p>
<p>I heard that one day, Gansan was performing at a Wangfu tanghui, singing the play "Prostitution." He played an old procuress who came out and saw the three princes, Prince Dun, Prince Gong, and Prince Chun, sitting in the front row in the center. He looked at the three princes and shouted, "Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh, come out to meet the guests!" Prince Gong laughed, Prince Chun was silent, but Prince Dun was furious and ordered someone to drag Gansan off the stage and beat him with military sticks. After the beating, he was still ordered to perform the play. Emperor Guangxu was the son of Prince Chun, and Emperor Xianfeng ranked fourth, Prince Dun ranked fifth, Prince Gong ranked sixth, and Prince Chun ranked seventh. Gansan's use of Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh to refer to the three princes was indeed too much of a prank, but Prince Dun's anger and beating of people for this reason was a bit too unromantic.</p>
<p>The most important condition of a democratic country is freedom of speech. However, this matter is difficult to say. The more a country claims to be democratic, the less the people can speak. The Travels of Lao Can says: "In general, there are two places where people speak from their stomachs. One is from below the dantian, which is their own words, and the other is from below the throat, which is polite words." The reason why Youmeng's clothing and hat are valuable is that they can speak the words from below the dantian for others, and express dissatisfaction with politics or figures in a humorous and witty tone, to the best of their ability to mock and scold. Such a famous clown is not easy to get again now.</p>
<h3>Spring Outing Grass</h3>
<p>— Sanmu</p>
<p>It's time for the wild rice stems to be reaped early,</p>
<p>Before the lamp, a thousand strokes are still roughly drafted.</p>
<p>When the wine is drunk, I urge the guests to leave some dregs,</p>
<p>I want to draft an evil poem for Xu Lingxi.</p>
<p>Wu Zixu Shrine at the Mouth of Xujiang River</p>
<p>The upstream situation should not be moved,</p>
<p>Grass fills the steps in front of Wu Zixu's shrine.</p>
<p>Each dynasty's plans of deer and laughter,</p>
<p>His lifelong ambitions belonged to Louzhi.</p>
<p>The spring rain is bleak along the shore,</p>
<p>The wind shakes the flags of the garrison soldiers at the corner of the hall.</p>
<p>Why bother with the tide that overflows in Qiantang,</p>
<p>In autumn, it still catches up with the tide riders!</p>
<p>Leaving the Mouth of Xujiang River and Entering Lake Tai, Gazing at the Mountains of Linwu</p>
<p>Gazing at the distant sky,</p>
<p>The floating snails gradually become intimate.</p>
<p>Water surrounds the dragon's lair,</p>
<p>Mountains line up like imperial stars.</p>
<p>Wanting to retire like the old men of Shangshan,</p>
<p>Come to exhaust the spring of Zhenze.</p>
<p>If purple fungi can be gathered,</p>
<p>I should allow myself to fish here.</p>
<p>Leaving, leaving, the immortal source is near,</p>
<p>Fish and dragons are quiet and do not clamor,</p>
<p>Floating waves, the fishing rafts are stable,</p>
<p>Green dots, the merchant sails are far away;</p>
<p>Mist embraces the mountains and they are completely lost,</p>
<p>The wind turns and the rain becomes even more proud.</p>
<p>Sitting, I suspect I am outside the human realm,</p>
<p>True companions are sure to want to meet.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the National Games</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>For more than ten years, whenever social unrest occurred, whether political or economic, the authorities invariably issued grand pronouncements about "treating the symptoms," "treating the root cause," or "treating both symptoms and root cause simultaneously." Yet, after so many years of "treating," neither the "root" nor the "symptoms" have moved an inch; they remain as they were. Why is this so? I believe the reason is quite simple: it's because they haven't truly engaged in the work of "treatment." In other words, it's due to the "incompetence" of government agencies and the lack of emphasis on "efficiency" in handling affairs. The root of most corruption in our country lies in these two words: "incompetence." In my view, this issue is extremely serious. Even after the suppression of the rebellion is complete, if this root cause isn't eradicated, I fear nothing will improve.</p>
<p>Take this National Games, for example. Several things clearly indicate a lack of coordination and inadequate planning in the handling of affairs. Consider the National Games, a major event. It shouldn't be hard to foresee the congestion of the crowds within the stadium. Our Mayor Wu is truly capable; he did think of the "convenience" issue beforehand. According to his estimate, "it would be best to have toilets capable of accommodating five hundred people within the stadium in order to collect tickets at the front gate of the venue. Otherwise, if the issue of urination and defecation isn't resolved, it will become a major problem." However, on the eve of the opening ceremony, when Mayor Wu inquired in detail with the person in charge of the venue, this person only "silently recalled" that there was one chamber pot here and two bedpans there, and only then did they discover that there were a total of twenty-one chamber pots and only seven urinals. Moreover, some of the water tanks were leaking, and the areas around some of the chamber pots were covered in sewage. "Two washbasins were still being hastily assembled." The Mayor asked, "Why haven't they been completed by now?" The staff member replied, "They were completed, but they broke, and they are currently being repaired." When asked about the urinals, the staff member said, "The original plan was to build them, but now, due to insufficient manpower, we had to omit them."</p>
<p>I used to be a sports enthusiast and originally planned to go to the venue to watch, but after reading this news report, my enthusiasm waned considerably. I thought perhaps other troubles would arise. Sure enough, on the afternoon of the first day of the Games, someone returning from the venue told me that the railing of the stands had collapsed, injuring many people. Upon hearing this news, I was half-doubtful and half-believing. I thought that the railing of the stadium stands was such an important piece of equipment within the venue, not something made of children's building blocks. How could it collapse? The railings of the racetracks in the city haven't been heard to collapse in all these years. It must be some malicious person spreading rumors. However, "things didn't go as wished." According to the next morning's newspaper report, it was indeed true. Some people were injured by falls, and some had broken arms. A total of thirty-two men and women were injured. The sequel to this incident will naturally be "investigating responsibility" – and after that, it will probably not have any sequel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for example, many spectators bought tickets but couldn't enter the venue. According to the results of "investigating responsibility," it was said that it was because many people entered the venue without tickets, causing excessive crowding. In this way, the responsibility was pushed onto the spectators, and the ticket-buying spectators are also part of the spectators, so there's nothing more to say, and it "should be beyond discussion." Also, for example, on the eleventh, due to rain, all competitions were suspended. The refereeing staff, because they didn't receive notification of the suspension of the competitions, still braved the rain to go to the venue to perform their duties. As a result, they were left empty-handed and couldn't help but complain, accusing the person in charge of "making fun of them." Matters such as these fully demonstrate the "independent spirit" of "you are you, and I am me," just as one reporter said: "As long as the 'opening ceremony' and 'completion ceremony' are done, and the 'music is played,' no one cares if people die afterward." In fact, it's also questionable whether anyone in the government cares if people have died before the "completion ceremony" and "music playing."</p>
<p>The most wonderful thing is that in the 10,000-meter long-distance final, runner Lou Wen'ao "was intentionally blocked by several runners midway." It is said that as a result of being blocked, Mr. Lou dodged left and right, darting east and west, trying to break through the encirclement, resulting in strides that resembled dancing. Some commentators say that such behavior lacks sportsmanship but instead uses statesmanship to engage in sports. I feel that this kind of behavior is also like filibustering in the American Congress. Excellent, excellent!</p>
<h3>The Fire Walkers</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In the South Pacific, there's the Fiji Islands, a group of 250 islands of various sizes inhabited by nearly 200,000 natives. Every year during the "Wilaviairevo" festival, they hold a fire-walking performance, which foreigners call the "Fire Walking Festival." During the performance, the natives walk and dance barefoot on white-hot rocks. They don't use any magic, nor do they apply any ointment to the soles of their feet, yet they are able to avoid being burned at all. Since white people conquered these islands, their powerful military has been consistently amazed by the natives' fire-walking performances. The Fijian performers appear to be in no pain whatsoever, nimbly walking on the scorching rocks without even a blister forming on their feet.</p>
<p>Before the performance, a shallow circular pit about thirty feet in diameter is dug in the ground, filled with dry branches and firewood. Then, a fire is used to ignite the firewood, and stones are rolled into the blazing pit. The stones are heated in the pit for about half a day. The next step is to spread fresh green leaves on the white-hot stones, creating a burst of steam. While the steam is billowing, the performers walk barefoot into the fire pit and begin a "folk dance." If foreign observers didn't think about the hot stones beneath the fire-walkers' feet, they might truly feel a sense of "floating like immortals."</p>
<p>But have the Fijian natives really developed bodies of steel, impervious to fire and heat? No. To be frank, the fire-walking performance can only be categorized as a "magic trick" – the key lies in "each having a different skill." It turns out that the entire Fiji Islands are volcanic in origin. The stones on the islands were originally formed by volcanic eruptions and cooling, so they have many pores. Even when heated to a white-hot state, they don't retain heat. Furthermore, the thick layer of green leaves covering the stones further protects the fire-walkers' feet, making it like dancing on a green leaf rug. If volcanic stones were replaced with pebbles from the beach, the Fijian natives would definitely "politely decline."</p>
<h3>The Blind Historian</h3>
<p>— Song Xian</p>
<p>More than a hundred years ago, an American youth named Prescott unfortunately suffered severe eye injuries while playing with classmates, and one eye was completely shattered. He stayed in the hospital for months, sleeping in a dark room every day. Although he was treated by many famous doctors, his remaining half of an eye still couldn't regain its sight.</p>
<p>He勉力 finished university and then worked in his father's law firm. However, his eye still ached. After various treatments, it only got worse. So he had to live in a dark room, completely blacked out, where even the tables, chairs, and bed were invisible. His daily exercise was limited to groping around the room for a walk.</p>
<p>A gifted young man trapped in a semi-disabled state – his future was probably hopeless. However, the reality was not so. Prescott, with his remarkable perseverance, finally completed a great work. In the dark room, he completed sixteen thick books, becoming a famous historian!</p>
<p>Day after day, he sat in the pitch-black room, carefully listening to his assistant read countless reference books. He memorized them in his mind, then listed the outlines. After a long period of thinking and organizing, he dictated his works paragraph by paragraph. He spent thirty-nine years living such a tedious life, completing sixteen books, including histories of Spain, Mexico, and Peru. Their content was clear and fair, and they have been internationally recognized as standard historical works.</p>
<p>In the last ten years, his eyes were almost completely blind, and his heart gradually deteriorated. Yet, he remained optimistic and excited.</p>
<p>"Don't think I'm depressed because of this. No! I won't be. My interest will beat faster than usual, just like my pulse!" he said.</p>
<p>Prescott's courage was by no means the courage of a commoner, nor was it the courage of an explorer or speculator who risked everything on success or failure, life or death. His courage enabled a semi-disabled person to maintain his confidence and optimism in the dark world, day after day, for decades. This is the courage of calmness, persistence, and hard work.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Lang Qian Ji Wen (written by Chen Kangqi) narrates that his younger brother, a court secretary, loved to collect ancient inkstones and only collected those with poetry, prose, or seal carvings. He once arranged for "Inkstone Annotations," collecting a wide range of information. This is the most discerning and tasteful. The inscriptions of praise and poems are mostly elegant and refined, suitable for wear and contemplation, which benefits the mind and body. This is the first benefit. Having the handwriting of the ancients on the desk is like meeting them face-to-face, forging an ancient friendship. This is the second benefit. When we buy old calligraphy rubbings, we can only get their paper copies, not the original stones. Even if we could, as Ye Changchi wrote in his diary, "During the Dragon Boat Festival, he obtained a stone railing from the bridge and transported it to Beijing by large cart, alarming the streets." This can be called a good thing. In my opinion, it's not only a good thing but downright foolish. Inkstones, on the other hand, are small and exquisite, with ancient carvings, convenient for display and easy to rub, allowing them to be given to friends and entrusted to letters. This is the third benefit. The inkstones I have obtained all have good inscriptions or elegant phrases. I bought several inkstones of Ji Xiaolan, knowing that they were imitations, but I kept them because I liked their words. One is very large and thick, an irregular elliptical shape with a green edge. The inscription reads: "Neither square nor round, neither dull nor carved, slightly polished, virtue is imperceptible. Like metal in the furnace, like jade separated from the rough stone. Yuzhou has many talents, exceeding all others. Meeting in a room, a gentleman's pleasure." The words are excellent, but the calligraphy and engraving are mediocre, not a high-level imitation. Another is small and square, with a "double ring" interlocked seamlessly on the front ink pool and below. On the back is inscribed, "Welcoming the ring can be solved, I dare not know. What cannot be solved, solve it with non-solution." Philosophical meaning, concise and witty words, elegant calligraphy, and neat engraving. It is very convenient to use as a paperweight. All of these, although not the original objects of Ji, are imitated based on the originals. Therefore, imitations may not be unworthy of appreciation.</p>
