<h3>麥帥主軍事援華　對被邀作證事已提出答覆</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京三日電〕麥帥副一官本克上校宣稱：關於衆議員伊頓邀請麥帥發表對於援華意見事，麥帥已於三日晚提出答覆。渠稱，答覆中可能接受邀請，然並未透露答覆中曾否提及麥帥對援華問題之意見，並謂須俟伊頓將此在美國公布後，方可在東京予以公布。　〔合衆社東京三日電〕此間盟一軍總部對麥帥受華府邀請向國會一提供其對美國援華意見之態度，迄三日中午猶保持緘默，然一般預料麥帥將提出一備忘錄，表示其對美國在亞洲地位之意見。</p>
<p>若干觀察家相信，麥帥可能歡迎提供其意見之綜合聲明之機會。彼等並認爲，此項聲明將在廿四小時中電吿華府，以提供正在考慮援華問題之衆議院外委會，此間一致同意麥帥將儘其可能反對主張渠應親赴華府一行之建議，蓋目前正値日本新政府行將組成，朝鮮將舉行聯合國所決定之選舉及在中國可能發生爆炸性事件（反美情緒受共產黨之煽動隨時能在中國爆發）之際，一時不容麥帥離開遠東，即使短短數天亦不允許。麥帥對中國問題之備忘錄內容，將完全保守秘密直至送交華府時，然此間一般預一料麥帥將指出下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）中國問題主要在軍事問題，故應以此項觀點加以處理。美國應强調對中國政府之軍事援助，直至「親蘇之中共運動，被消減爲止。若干數量之經濟及財政援助，乃爲軍事計劃中之必要部份，但軍事問題之解決，需要永遠列於腦海中。一旦軍事問題解決，中國政府能恢復現被中國蘇維埃所控制區域之主權，此後中國可奠定經濟及社會建議之基礎。</p>
<p>（二）應以中國與整個亞洲形勢有關之觀察，來觀察中國問題，就地理上及軍事上觀點而言之，中國之於亞洲，就德國之於歐洲。</p>
<p>（三）若蘇聯能控制整個中國，則很明顯地西方民主國家難以阻止日本，菲列濱，暹羅，印度等國家遭遇同一命運。</p>
<p>（四）美國在西太平洋及亞洲東部之利益，與美國在歐洲之利益相等，日本征服東九省，其後進軍深入中國大陸，乃上次大戰之主要原因，若蘇聯追隨同一之行徑</p>
<p>（五）任何對中國局勢之考慮，最好證明中共政權自莫斯科接受其最重要之靈感，並已成爲蘇聯「極權敝國主義之衛星國。」</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕美衆院外　　已接獲之援華建議計有下列三種：（一）美政府所提之為期十五個月之五億一千萬美元之應急貨物方案及六千萬美元之長期所提之爲期三年之九億三千九百萬美元獲興方案，並規定第一年度撥款五億七千三百萬美元，以及數額未定之軍事援助。</p>
<h3>魏德邁將軍　亦出席作證</h3>
<p>阿樂滿律師促請援華</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕魏德邁將軍將於三日晨出席衆院外委會，爲援華事宜作證，該會尙未接得麥克阿瑟元帥與陳納德之答復，說明渠等是否將親自返國，陳述其對於援華之意見。一</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕前在一上海之美國律師阿樂滿，二日在一衆院外交委員會陳述意見稱：中國無須再有一種僅屬救濟性質之援助計劃，而需建設性且切合實際之工業復興計劃，規定穩定幣制，復興農工業，恢復交通與運輸，軍事援助及立即經濟協助等五項。中國銀行家希望恢復硬幣本位，爲求完成其目標起見，須向美國借貸白銀約六億盎斯，鈔票則須停止印行。</p>
<h3>處理救濟物資會　決資助公立醫院</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕政院處一理美國救濟物資委員會，三日舉一行例會，會中曾就該會衛生，醫一藥委員會所提各項計劃加以審核，即將付諸實施。計劃中最重要者，係擬以美國救濟物資中之醫藥器材及醫藥臨時補助費，補助一滬，京。平。津。靑。廣。漢等一七大都市之中央及市立醫院及冀·魯·蘇·豫·鄂·皖·晋·陜·察·熱等十省之政府醫院，以一期各該醫院，能予貧病難民以緊急醫藥救濟，其於防癆·霍亂·鼠疫等亦均有實施防治之計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報天津三日電〕津美國救濟物資配售委會三日正式成立，配合民食調配委會籌備普遍配售。美救濟物資中麵粉五六〇〇噸頃已分三船北運，內二船巳抵津。</p>
<h3>國民黨將召開五中全會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕有關方面息：國民黨將乘各中委來京出席國民大會之便，召開五中全會。又關於總統，副總統之候選人提名問題，國民黨方面亦將於國民大會召開前，集會討論決定。</p>

<h3>蒲立特出席衆院外委會作證　力陣美國在遠東危機　要求另派瞭解政經軍事務特使前來我國</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕蒲立特二日出高雅衆院外交委員會爲援華案作證（掃浦氏發言要點，已載昨日本報），指摘國務字元對華之「盲目與冷淡」，竭力主張通過建議中之經濟援華議案。渠稱：「此項經濟援助之數目，如能加以有效之管理，則在純粹經濟方面，應已足夠。管理原則之規定須有充份之伸縮性，使原擬購置某種物資之基金，必要時轉移　購辦另一種物資之用」。</p>
<p>渠對馬歇爾國務卿就美國業已供給中國武裝部隊之軍火數量與素質所提出之證辭，有所爭辯。渠謂馬歇爾之數字殊不確切。</p>
<p>浦立特要求派遣「了解政治，經濟事務問題並亦了解軍事事務之特使」前往南京。渠提出現任駐日盟軍最高統帥之麥克阿瑟將軍，或前駐奧盟國佔領軍統帥克拉克將軍，為可供推選之人。</p>
<p>浦氏稱：「吾人之國家，係在危險之中，蘇聯征服世界之戰略，係根據一項前提，即蘇聯之力量，尚不足以冒險與美國進行戰爭，惟必須建立其國內之戰爭潛力，並在進攻吾人以前，先使新戰略地區資源及人民置於其蘇聯遂加強其自一九三九年以來對於一億三千萬歐洲人民之控制；以第五縱隊之行動，企圖獲取法國及義大利國共產黨爲工具，謀以戰爭征服中國」。</p>
<p>渠警吿稱：「蘇聯如果控制中國，則能在亞洲大陸與日本之間，投下一層　幕，而日本不但共糧食與原料，而且其製成品之市塲，大半依賴亞洲大陸。此事將使日本無法維持其經濟生命，除非匍匐在鐵幕之下而成爲蘇聯之衛星國。共黨控制中國勢將引觀共黨之控制日本。中國爲整個遠東之咽喉要害。」</p>
<p>蒲立特指出，中國間題起於十年之戰爭，初爲對日作戰，後爲對共黨作戰。渠稱：中國政府之支出，用於軍事者約佔百分之八十；因此，軍事之情形，勢必控制經濟與財政之情形，蓋因軍事上之敗績將　通盤之喪失。美國外交政策之錯誤在於誤認蘇聯爲愛好和平之國家，而暗示由共與莫斯科並無聯絡，以爲大半均屬土地改革者。</p>
<p>經實詢後，渠稱中國問題之解決，則需長久之時間，惟渠警吿謂，將來可能發生一種局勢，致使美國「將自白令海峽至新加坡，面對一堅實之共產黨陣綫」。渠稱，協助中國以防止此種局勢所需之金錢，以與歐洲所需　　　，為數頗小。</p>
<p>外委會並聽取阿爾曼之憲見，阿氏前會在中國擔任外交工作。渠稱中國所需者爲一「積極的現實的復興計劃，而非任何僅　救濟性質之計劃」。渠謂此項計劃應包括通貨改革，晨業及農業建設，以及運輸與交通之恢復。渠與浦立特相同，亦主以軍事援助與立即　動之經濟援助，給予中國政府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕據蒲立特估計對中國除軍事援助外，如每年予以四億五千萬元之援助，三年即可復興。</p>
<p>衆議員傑克遜建議，在軍事狀態繼續下，中國不可能有經濟上之穩定。蒲立特同意此點，渠稱，如予以足够之軍事援助，余相信三年內可將中國共黨整個肅淸。渠稱「如在四月初能獲得小型武器與軍需，瀋陽即能保持」。</p>
<p>蒲立特稱：渠對蔣主席非常敬仰與崇拜，蔣主席應爲世界十大領袖之一。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二電〕蒲立特在衆院外委會作證時，或問維特中國避免共產黨控制在軍事上有何重要性？蒲氏答：「余知西伯利亞現有廣大之新工業區，集中於貝加爾湖附近；轟炸機自中國西北部起飛，始能抵達該區，但若中國淪入史達林之手，則該一大工業區將無被襲之虞」。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>教育行政的民主化</h3>
<p>今年是行憲年，爲了配合行憲需要，敎育部敎育硏究委員會曾致函全國敎育學者，徵求其對於設實各級敎育的民意機關之意見，中國激育學會舉行年會時亦決議請求政府普設各級敎育參議會。這個建議如蒙政府採納，它將無疑地成爲我國敎育行政上劃時代的一個革新。</p>
<p>什麽是敎育參議會？它是歐美先進國在近百年來逐漸改進的一個適合民主理想的敎育機構。在歐美民主國的敎育行政制度之中，有兩個平行的系統：其一爲行政系統，運用敎育上的行政權與考試權，其主要職務爲執行敎育政策，調査學童，增設學校，檢定敎師，輔導敎學，編製預算及工作報吿書等；其二爲立法系統，行使敎育上的立法，司法，監察權，其主要職務爲決定敎育政策，審核敎育預算，規定敎育稅率，保管敎育經費，批准課程標準，選定敎科書，選任各級敎育官吏，接受被革退敎師的訴訟，監察或彈劾各級敎育官吏與校長等。在行政系統方面，中央有敎育部，地方有敎育廳，局，科等；在立法系統方面，中央有全國敎育參議會，地方有省，縣，鄕，村敎育參議會，其參議員均由大衆票選能代表各階層利益而熱心敎育的人士充任之。在極權國家內，只有敎育行政系統而無敎育立法系統；只有敎育部，廳，局，科，而無各級敎育參議會。在民主國家內，敎育行政系統必須受敎育立法系統的控制；敎育部，廳，局等必須聽命於各級敎育參議會。自民國成立以來，我國從未設置敎育的立法機關，所以敎育行政始終停留在對建制度的階段。有民　思想的敎育學者老早就想把歐美先進國的敎育參議會的制度介紹到中國來。筆於二十餘年前，在「中國新敎育行政制度之硏究」一書中亦曾建議普設各級敎育的民意機關並詳細規定其組織與職權，但當時適値訓政開始，這種建議因不合時宜而未能引起一般人的注意。現在行憲伊始，中國敎育學會乃決議請求政府普設各級敎育參議會，其前途如何雖未可逆料，但筆者敢斷言這是中國敎育行政民主化的躅光。</p>
<p>敎育參議會的設置有什麽利益，設置這種機關的主要目標在使教育行政制度民主化。所謂民主化的敎育行政制度是大衆所有，所治，所享的制度。它是大衆本位的制度，是用大衆的錢，由大衆參加，辦理爲大衆謀幸福的敎育之制度。簡單一句話，它是讓大衆參加敎育行政的一種制度。這種制度的利益是極顯明的。第一，敎育參議會的設置足以增加敎育稅收與防止敎育專款的挪用和浪費。在民主社會中，徵稅的稅率和方式必須得納稅者的同意。要大衆用錢辦敎育必須使大衆願意出錢，要使大衆願意出錢必須增進其對敎育的興趣，要增進其對敎育的興趣必須使其在敎育行政上有積極參加的機會。敎育參議會的設置就是要使大衆參加敎育行政以增進其對敎育的興趣而願意出更多的錢來辦敎育。並且敎育經費旣由敎育參議會來保管，則普通行政長官不敢將它移作別用，敎育行政首長亦不敢營私舞弊，敎育行政效率亦可因此提高。第二，敎育參議會的設豐足以防止派系　　並保障敎師的職業和自由．在　社會中，敎育官吏對其曆峯負責，只要得　　的信任，其位置安穩如泰山，自可結黨營私，壟斷敎育，同時無派系背景的敎育工作者的職業則毫無保陣。在民主社會中，敎育官吏要對大衆負實，要得敎育參議會的支持，一旦失去信仰，便會被彈劾而撤職，故無法壟斷敎育，除非他們能壟斷敎育參鵝會，但這是極不容易的事情。同時敎育工作者因受排擠而去職的可上訴於敎育參饑會，若得勝訴，仍可回原職服務，其職業和言論自由亦可得相當保障了。第四，敎育參議會的設置足以保證所辦的敎育即是爲大衆謀福利的敎育。在舊社會中，國家敎育只代表少數貴族，地主，軍閥，官僚的特殊權益，因爲大衆對於敎育政策的決定，課程標準的編制，道德陶冶的內涵等並無發言權。在民主社會中，大衆在敎育行政上的權威是高於一切的，敎育參議會可決定敎育政策，審定敎科書，確定陶冶內涵與方式等，所以農工大衆與其他階層的利益在敎育政策與內涵上都獲得確切的保證，大衆福利變爲敎育價値的試金石，凡能經得起這試金石考驗的即可存在，否則即被淘汰。由大衆參加的敎育才能眞正爲大衆謀福利，才能眞正剷除敎育上的封建遺毒。</p>
<p>敎育參議會的設置能適合我國的歷史傳統嗎？敎育參議會雖然是歐美民主國的制度，但移植到中國來並無枘　不相入的困難，因為我國地方敎育有頗悠久的民主傳統。要遙遠的不必說，即如明淸兩代的社學和書院都有所謂執事會，其執事是由地方紳士公推出來，其職權亦略如歐美敎育參議會的職權，如募集學田學榖，修建校舍，保管校產，聘請敎師或山長等，在聚族而居的鄉村中，每一祠堂有由族人公推出來的執事所組成的　事織，其職權的一部分是保管　田，設立私塾，聘請敎師，獎勵族中靑年應試等，這亦是由人民參加的民主的敎育組織之　形。這些優良的民主傳統在我國鄕村中或許有千餘年的歷史。民國成立以後，河南省和　南省的敎育經費都曾一度獨立過，都曾設置敎育經費管理委員會，其成績都甚卓著，其職權則酷似美國的州敎育委員會的職權。至於鄕村的民主的敎育組織，似可舉江西萍鄉縣所行的制度爲一例證。該縣每村有一「敎子會」，其幹事若干人係由族人公推出來的，其職權是徵募學田學榖，修建保學校舍，保管校產，聘請敎師，發給獎學　等。該村兒童入學不僅一切免費，而且每人每年可得學榖二至五担不等。該村學生升入中學者每人每年可得六至十担學榖，升入大學者每人每年可得二十至三十担學榖。學生留級則是年無學榖，畢業後亦不得領學榖。該縣敎子會的組織極普遍，所以學田畝數佔全縣耕地而積十分之一，義務敎育大抵已普及了。聽設湖南各縣亦有類似敎子會的組織，所以保學亦很發達。根據上述事實，我們可以設：敎育參議會的設置並非把西洋教育制度勉强塞入中國社會組織之中，而是繼承千餘年社學和書院的優良傳統，綜合民國成立以後各地實驗的結果，再參照歐美先進國的經驗，加以充實擴大的敎育制度之確立。它和我國的歷史傳統是有繼續性的。</p>
<p>總而言之，教育參議會的設置不僅利用了歐美先進國的寶貴經驗，而且繼承了我國有的優良傳統。這種制度如果運用得當，必能增加敎育稅收，提高行政效率，防止派系壟斷，保陣敎育自由，發展大衆福利，並實現民有，民治，民享的敎育理想。</p>
<h3>改善東北財政意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕東北請願團對政院及有關機關所提建議書，關於財政金融改善意見部份全文如次：</p>
<p>（一）束北財政金融之現狀東北收復區相繼淪陷後，交通梗阻，物資缺乏，匯兌不通，貨幣窒息，以至物價高漲，籌碼不足，周轉失靈，因目下瀋陽中央銀行分行應付未付款約三千億，瀋陽區本年二·三·四月份應即搶購軍糧廿一萬包，約需款一千六百億，各軍事業機關經費月需三千億，以本才來京當時（二月廿五日）即急需鈔票六千六百億，而該行僅存鈔票二百億，供需相去懸殊，實屬駭人聽聞，因此，遭致如下之惡果，影響剿匪者至大，一，糧款無法支付，影響搶購軍糧，一一，軍糧無法發放，影響兵心士氣，三，公敎人員及一切員工薪餉無法發放，影響行政及生產效率，除設法即行撥款，以濟燃眉外，政府應於此時對流通券之發行作一鄭重重新之考慮。據本團來京時國軍所能控制區僅餘四十八個鄉（現恐更少）以四十八個鄉之人民担負全部軍政費用，將何以堪，即使軍事不敗，經濟亦必崩潰無疑，故解決此流通券間題，實爲刻不容緩者。</p>
<p>（一）矯正之具體辦法一，開放匯兌，吸收通貨回籠，使各地平均負担。自奸匪擴大叛亂後，收復區僅餘四十餘鄕鎭，人口不足數百萬，使其担負全部剿匪之費用，實屬不合情理，亦爲決無可能之事實。蓋剿匪宜由全體人民負担，東北豈可例外，再以今日瀋陽物價論，高於平·津者三倍，高於京·滬者五倍，實乃由於物資與通貨供應失調，荀開放匯兌，各地物價不致相差如此縣殊，今者，東北物價遠高於關內各地者，實因幣制不同匯兌管制所致也。故爲挽救東北經濟崩潰及影響剿匪軍事計，中央應即將關內外各地匯兌完全開放，以便資金流入各地，而使負担平衡。二，停止發行流通券使現有流通券可與法幣關金定値互用。東北收復，當時以東北金融經濟情形特殊，爲適應地方，謀人民生活安定，穩定物價起見，特准央行發行東北九省流通券，此原爲一時權宜之措施，收復之初，穩定地方金融尙著成效，茲時過境遷，東北各地相繼失陷，民衆窮苦，物價高漲，軍需浩大，通貨充斥，經濟失調，中央應即規定法幣與流通劵之固定比値，停止發行，自由匯兌，使法幣與流通券在關內外流通使用，金融穩定，裨益於剿匪者至大也。</p>
<h3>中國社會研究會討論我政經途徑</h3>
<p>（上接一版）（六）民主制度必基於政黨組織之運用，國內應有並立的政黨，互相批評監督，並各致力於爭取民意的支持，政黨不得假借任何口實，施用暴力壓迫異己，民意的最後表現，爲選舉政權的轉移，應視選舉的結果而定；（七）選舉以區城爲單位，人民所選代表負責行使政權；（八）地方自治基本原則，憲法應加保障，凡地方自治事項，中央僅能在法定範圍內行使監督權；（九）民主政治不應只重形式，並應注重行政對大衆所生實惠，我們所要的民主政治，應保障人民基本自由與權利，務使免於恐懼，匱乏，壓迫，剝削。</p>
<p>乙，外交方面：（十）以內政的協調，謀外交的協調；（十一）推行睦鄰政策，建樹獨立國策；（十二）反對種族歧視，支援弱小民族，尊重其獨立意識；（十三）反對以戰爭爲國家政策工具，國際糾紛應依據正義及國際法和平解決，贊成裁减軍備並樹立國際管制制度，擁護健全國際組織，使其能眞正解決糾紛；（十四）贊成國際經濟文化合作；（十五）反對任何政府或集團操縱言論，從而造成國際間宣傳攻勢，妨碍國際和平。</p>
<p>丙，經濟方面：（十六）發展國家資源，實現全民就業，促成公平分配，提高生活水準；（十七）積極促進現代化，工業化；（十八）全國土地以全部收歸國有爲最終目標，應先規定私人農地最高限制，超過者收歸國有，予原來地主以長期債券補償，收歸國有農地成租自耕農，或集體經營；（十九），（二十）略，（二一）金融事業國營，國家銀行之私人股本立即收回，並簡化統一機構；（二二）略，（二三）賦稅政策應以平均私人財富國家資本，保進資源開發經濟繁榮及達成社會安全；（二四）略，（二五）歡迎不帶政治作用而配合我經濟政策的國外投資，在互惠條件下，參加我經濟建設。</p>
<p>丁，社會及其他方面計七條，略。</p>
<h3>宋子文答記者問</h3>
<p>（上接一版）宋氏答復記者之詢問稱：（一）米糧走私出口，過去每天四千担，現祗一千担，現已嚴厲禁止，如有拘獲者，不管其爲何人，或有何勢力，必將其送往東北。（二）剿匪現已採取攻勢，東江韓江治安較差，現已派大兵淸剿，數月後大股匪軍實力可完全消滅。（三）建築黃埔港事，今年即開工，張嘉璈氏對此甚感興趣，現決定分期完成。（四）現因轄管制度甚嚴，使大量僑匯逃港，現正設法防止，僑匯復原不難。（五）汕頭糧荒嚴重，現已盡力設法，除社會處撥卅噸至汕頭外，邏米運到亦可運往救濟。現閩省已允粵購量七千担，台灣三千担亦在商談中。（六）海南島鋼鐵廠亦積極進行，一渠希望能在其任內完成此事。（七）東北問題雖嚴重，但渠相信政府足可應付，我人以抗戰精神，一切困難均可解決。（八）投資本省實業，祇要有益民生經濟，不問中外人士，一律歡迎，但游一資及投機事業，則絕不歡迎。最後氏對外傳渠將向長政院，及赴美消息，稱渠甚願爲鄕梓服務，上項消息並無根據。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州三日電〕宋子文語記者稱：改善建設粵漢路之六千萬美元之美援實現後，除一部份改善該路鐵軌車廂等外，並將興築由韶關至吉安之粵贛鐵路，以後粵贛兩省物資互助大有帮助，贛省物資亦可轉粵漢路而直達武昌，渠並相信此事必能成功。</p>

<h3>國防部政工局發表　一週戰況概述　國軍完全控制瀋陽新民陣綫</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國防部政工局三日發表二月廿五日至三月二日之一週戰况概述，全文如次：</p>
<p>東北　本週戰局市點，仍在東北，匪為孤立潘陽起見，先後竭全力以截斷北寧路和控制遼南。因爲在營口偸襲成功，遼西匪軍爲呼應遼南起見，亦集中四個縱隊的兵力，團攻新民，一方面又抽調三個縱隊，猛撲開原，還想成脅四平，目的不外想乘東北解凍以前，鞏固遼南海口的防守，打通由北滿向南的陸‘補給綫，以預防國軍在春暖後的全面攻勢，所以不惜重大犧牲，一面集中砲火猛烈轟擊，一面以人海戰術　死肉搏。</p>
<p>經過了這樣全力進犯，除了遼南和開原因國軍兵力單薄，增援不易，致匪　　投機侵佔外，在新民和巨流河之綫，匪却受了慘重損失，附近各縱隊均正向遼北撤退，新民和潘陽的陣綫，仍然完全被國軍的英勇　兒所控制住．</p>
<p>華北　華北方面，國軍本週內普　展開　蕩，廿八日在平津保三角地帶收復了永淸縣，在獨流以東擊潰了匪渤海軍區匪一千餘，收復了老君堂，傳家窩等重要據點。同時南口國軍在十三陵一帶，又將匪熱察冀邊區工作團全部解決，並生俘匪團長高哲以下三十餘人，現仍繼續索匪主力淸剿中。</p>
<p>華中　華中方面的陳毅匪部，自被國軍由豫東，他被追急了，不得不採取分股流竄的方式，匪軍疲敝的兵力，總是逃避與我方接戰，這幾天，其第一縱隊山舊考城越路南竄，曾受重大打擊，傷亡逾三千人，第三縱隊主力及第八縱隊，則由平漢綫郾城以東地區，竄到路西禹縣與襄城之間，第八，十，十一，三個縱隊，則流竄於柘城，太康，淮陽三角地區間，至於隔斷在魯西的第四縱隊，除了兩廣縱隊避戰整補以外，仍在企圖維持陳毅的後方補給綫，國軍爲打擊匪軍主力，刻正分途搜剿中。</p>
<p>大別山區的劉伯承匪部，現已走向日暮途窮，成爲一個戰塲的殘局了。他的三：六兩縱隊，經國軍屢次打擊後，仍在羅山，經扶，麻城，英山各附近山地流竄，其第二縱隊幷有由息縣經烏能集又再北逃的模樣，第一縱隊仍在任邱以南地區，國軍爲了收拾這一殘局，刻正分別加緊淸剿，山區之匪，已一天比一天削弱了。</p>
<p>晉陜　晋陜方面，彭匪德懷率其一，二，三，四，六等五個縱隊的主力，於上月廿四日開始向我宜川進犯，該地國軍曾予迎頭痛擊，一　夜間，匪傷亡到了六千四百多人，廿九日，匪首賀龍又率領五個旅，由晋西渡河增援，國軍以一當十，雖亦有損傷，但無不英勇奮戰，現還在相持中。彭匪的目的，不外想牽制國軍東進圍剿陳賡匪部，一方面還想孤立延安，或再竄回延安老集，但這個夢想，是不易成功的。</p>

<h3>阻遏共產勢力向西擴展　美亟需予土希援助　馬歇爾向眾院外委會呼籲　美議員主設國際新機構保障集體安全</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：華盛頓訊，國務卿馬歇爾及國防部長福萊斯特今日出席衆院外交委員會作證，聲稱共產黨對希土之壓力正日益加重中，苟此爾國欲雜持其自由，則必須獲得美國之援助。渠兩人力促國會再准撥付二億七千五百萬美元，作爲對希土之軍事援助。馬卿認爲此項援助可加强希政府反抗游擊隊之鬥爭。福氏則認爲援助希土爲美國反抗共產主義侵略之決心的一種測驗，並謂惟有吾人力能予希土以援助保持其自由，使其繼續處身於民主國家之間。苟吾人躊躇不前，則美國在重建世界方面之領導地位以及和平之前途，將蒙莫大不利云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕共和黨參議員多人，今日向參院提出馬歇爾計劃修正案一件，主張由美國領導各國在聯合國機構以外另行設立國際最高委員會，藉以阻遏蘇聯勢力之擴張，該案係共和黨十四人昨夜開會討論修改馬歇爾計劃時決定，全文雖未直指蘇聯，但用意了然。依照該案規定，在未來世界新機構中不得使用否決權，其主要任務爲防止「任何方式之侵略或破壞」。據參與昨夜會議之參議員白留斯特稱，新機構乃一種「攻守同盟」，將供給「有效的集體安全」，而不受否決權損害。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕參院共和黨議員指摘政府之出口政策，斥政府以歐洲復興計劃中所需之稀有物資運往蘇聯。諾蘭特與范登堡要求政府說明爲何一方面以工業物資遝往蘇聯，而另一方面請求國會以數百億元防止歐洲之共產主義。商務部代理部長福斯特頃致函諾蘭時否認，曾以稀有物資運往蘇聯。渠稱：一九四七年運往蘇聯之總値達一億四千九百十二萬九千元，其中僅包括火車，車輛，電機，電動機械工具，開礦機等，決無有直接協助戰事之物品。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕代表英法國會議員之英法友誼組今日發表公報，表示希望西歐聯盟得以早日成立。英議員代表團領袖前保守黨外相艾登在今晨該組會議中致辭稱，英法兩國如不能互相諒解，則誠將為世界和平而沮喪矣。英代表團及法議員代表今午應皮杜爾外長之宴。</p>
<h3>歐洲十六國會議貝文將親自出席</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕官方宣布，參加馬歇爾方案歐洲十六國之全體大會於三月十五日在巴黎舉行時，英外相貝文將親出席。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬二日電〕義總工會執委會今決定不參加在倫敦舉行之馬歇爾方案諸國工會大會。</p>
<h3>被捕土共產黨員　受秘密審訉</h3>
<p>〔聯合社伊斯坦埠二日電〕共產黨員五十六名被控組織團體，從事階級鬥爭，今日秘密受審。此乃一九四六年十二月淸共運動所拘最後一批。當時被捕者數百人，政黨及工會被解散，並有出版商四家被封。被吿對於秘密審訊，抗議無效。據檢察官稱，人民對共黨已起公憤，爲安全起見，秘密審訊實殊必要云。</p>
<h3>蘇匈使館互升格</h3>
<p>〔路透社布達佩斯二日電〕蘇聯及匈牙利政府業已同意昇格兩國公使爲大使。本年二月匈牙利曾與蘇聊簽訂二十年友好互助公約。</p>
<h3>蘇原子武器七年後可實現</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約二日電〕美「展望」雜誌頃發表賀恰頓與雷蒙德二氏之論文一篇稱，一九五四年將爲蘇聯能生產足够之　以製造任何原子武器之最早時期。二氏稱：當蘇聯製成其第一度原子彈時，美國已製成之　貯藏量當已爲蘇聯十八年產量之和矣。</p>
<h3>英義友好條約</h3>
<p>英政府正作最後潤色</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二日電〕外交部專家多人現正對英義友好，貿易及航運條約作最後之潤色。該項草案即將轉致義大利政府，至於原有一八八三年之條約，則因義大利向盟國宣戰而告失效。</p>

<h3>蘇聯贊同五強直接會商解決聖地分治案　英國聲明拒絕參與合作</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖二日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯今日在聯合國安理會聲明有條件接受美國建議五大國共同設法解決巴勒斯坦問題。葛氏宣稱，蘇聯反對正式設立五大國委員會與阿猶及英國三方磋商。此事須由五大國自行磋商，如另設委會適足拖延解決，任何大國不應隱藏於委會幕後。美國所提設立五大國委員會與當事者磋商一案，殊屬牽强，不能認爲正當。目前已有巴勒斯坦委會與猶阿雙方磋商，實無添設駢枝機構之必要。五大國舉行非正式會議後，應在十天或十五天以內報吿安理會，局勢迫切，不容再緩。此外關於巴勒斯坦委會要求派遺國際軍協助執行聖地分治一節，葛氏仍未表明態度，其他各國代表亦對此點遲不發言。先是，美代表奧斯丁發言，促請通過其一星期前所提出之建議，並謂美國擁護聯大會所通過之巴勒斯坦分治案，但必須用和平方法執行之。奧氏發言將終，請安理會必須有所行動時，公衆旁聽座忽有一婦人高呼「那種行動？」　兵即阻止該婦人呌喊，惟該婦人仍刺刺不休，衛兵乃　將其押出會塲，該婦人一面抵抗，一面呌喊：「美國人無權發言嗎？」其他衛兵見狀齊集，卒將其扶出。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三日電〕英殖民大臣瓊斯昨吿安理會稱，英國將拒絕參加美國建議之五強委員會，以覓取解決聯合國執行分治計劃的僵局之方法，渠並聲明英軍駐在巴勒斯坦決不延長至八月一日以後。</p>
<h3>聯合國人員抵耶城</h3>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷三日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦委員會秘書處之職員六人，今日抵達耶　。</p>
<h3>菲島華僑學校失愼</h3>
<p>〔聯合社爲尼刺一一日電〕菲律賓今日發生大火兩起，一起在巴古洛鎭，居民一千人流離失所。一處為馬尼刺華僑某學校，學　一千名失學。</p>
<h3>德境英美合併區蒲恩特當選總理</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗朗克福二日電〕英美合併區經濟委員會今日以四十票對八票，棄權者四十八票，選舉蒲恩特爲主席。共黨委員以蒲氏未獲出席委員之過半數多數，表示抗議，並提出「不信任」之動議，惟以不信任案須待合併區邦議會及英美管制當局批准主席之任命後始能提出，故共黨議員之反對企圖，一時未能實施。經濟委會之主席，等於合併區之「總理」。又巴成里亞基督社會聯盟黨之艾爾哈特當選爲經濟委會之經濟部長，其他當選者爲糧食農林部長許寗根·財長哈特曼·交通部長弗洛美·郵電部長許培特。觀察家預料新「總理」可望得自由黨及基督民主黨之支持，但將面臨共黨及社會黨之反對。</p>
<h3>芬蘭臨十字路口　總統向史達林質詢七項問題　各政黨均贊成與蘇試行談判</h3>
<p>〔聯合社芬京三日電〕今日確悉：巴西基維總統已對國會遲未說明關於蘇聯要求締約問題之意見，漸感不耐。各黨領袖雖均贊成進行締約談判，但强調不必因此接受史達林之建議。巴氏依照其對付蘇聯之多年經騐，深恐國會拖延結果，將激怒蘇聯，並破壞有利之談判基礎。黨派集團主席宣稱，　人無意利用拖延策略，但問題甚爲嚴重，必須縝密考慮。</p>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基二日電〕此間今日宣布：芬　總統巴西基維爲蘇聯建議與芬締結軍事互助條約事，已向史達林提出七項問題，其中包括：（一）該約對於已因和約而大事削减之芬蘭軍隊，將規定何種義務；（二）該約對於公共與論將有何種影響；（三）該約將改進兩國關係，抑將損害兩國關係；（四）該約對和約有無影響；（五）羅馬尼亞及保加利亞條約中若干條文之意義。蓋史達林曾特別提出羅保條釣，以爲對芬互助條約之模範。此項間題已列入芬總統於上星期六托蘇聯公使薩伏能柯夫轉呈史達林之函中。政府專家於硏究此項問題後，業已擬具報吿，惟各政黨除支持蘇芬締約之極左黨派外，尙在硏究之中。政黨領袖除人民民主聯盟之領袖外皆曰一芬蘭並不歡迎與蘇締結軍事互助條約，但亦無法拒絕討論。此等一領袖雖主張對蘇維持良好關係，但復認芬蘭最好能取中立立塲。彼等並主張與蘇締約與否，應由國會決定。聞巴西基維總統亦贊成取決於國會而不取決於聯合內閣。人民民主聯盟在內閣中，固佔有極重要之位置。</p>
<p>（聯合社芬京二日電〕芬蘭三大政黨之一即社會民主黨國會議員，今夜開會討論蘇聯要求芬蘭締結互助友好條約後發表聲明，　請依照憲政與民主方法處理此項問題，並指斥共黨企岡挑撥滋事，利用前局勢造成國內衝突與各階級間之傾軋不和。先是，共黨已開始宣傳支持蘇聯要求。共黨控制之人民民主同盟在國會二百席中佔五十一席，爲全國最大政黨，其他政府集團各黨如社會民主黨與農民黨則各佔四十八席。</p>
<p>共然「人民陣綫」與社會民主黨極左翼亦於深夜發表聲明，促請接受軍事條約，並稱贊聯為「吾大陸上最强大之國」。六大政黨之領袖各各舉行會議，吿誡黨人均謂芬蘭鮮有選擇餘地，惟有開始談判軍事條約。但各黨領袖重申接受談判非接受條約之</p>
<h3>義外次一時疏忽重要文件被竊</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社　馬三日電〕義外交次長布魯薩斯加有一蔽重要文件之公事皮包，三日失竊。該公事皮包係因一時疏忽，遺落於其汽車上，隨後在汽車夫離開汽車未加看守時，即遭失竊。此事引起外交部之神經緊張，警察大事搜査，迄今未有結果。</p>
<h3>危地瑪拉反英示威</h3>
<p>〔路透社危地瑪拉城三日電〕危地瑪拉人一萬餘人今日在英國公使館前市威，高呼「美洲人的美洲」「打倒英國」「貝利資是我們的」等口號。阿里伐洛總統向羣衆致辭，表示將在下屆汎美大會中要求取消歐洲國家在美洲之殖民地。</p>
<h3>小型大會設立十五國小組</h3>
<p>研究調解國際糾紛辦法</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖二日電〕聯合國小型大會，今日一致通過中美聯合建議成立十五國小組委員會，依照聯合國憲章，硏究增進國際合作，以維持和平。該項聯合建議對於聯合國之前途。具有遠大影響。該小組會將硏究各種建議，而各該建議主要目的，在求國際爭端在提交安理會與聯大會以前，由和解及調停機構謀求解決。若此項目的果吿成功，則聯合國即可免去若千政治糾紛。該小組會係由英·美·中·法·比·澳·巴西·哥倫比亞·多米尼加·厄瓜多·希臘·伊朗·黎巴嫩·瑞典·委內瑞拉等十五國組成，其研究結果於三星期內向小型大會提出初步報吿。</p>
<h3>英政府即將動用剩餘美貸一億元</h3>

<h3>捷厲行整肅運動　因此失業或降職者達數十萬　貝奈斯內心痛苦自殺說不確</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格二日電〕非正式方面估計捷吉整肅遝動中失業或降職者已達數十萬人，在莫拉維亞某一鐵廠內被解僱工人一千一百名，祗因不願簽名於效忠新政府宣言之故。</p>

<p>世界機構誕生前隱痛陣陣</p>
<p>一九四四年八月二十八日，鄧巴頓橡樹會議進入第二週時，蘇代表葛羅米柯突然在討論中，提出了一個新的令人吃驚的提案。</p>
<p>大會指導委員會的討論，正集中於應由那幾個國家作爲聯合國組織基本曾員國的問題，蘇聯和我們都認爲，會員國應該是聯合國及其協同的國家。但是，這事在解釋上發生了一個基本的不同。</p>
<p>我們的意思是說，會員國應爲一切簽字於聯合國宣言的國家，加上雖未與軸心官戰而在戰事進行中於物資上帮助盟國的八個國家。事實上，他們的貢獻較有些盟國本身還多。這八國是拉丁美洲六國，加上冰島和埃及。蘇聯則說，會員國應爲原來簽字於聯合國宣言的二十六個國家，而他們所解釋的「協同國家」，則是指以後也簽字於宣言的國家。他們不願把我們所舉的八國包括在內。關於後一點，我們的討論迄無結果。事實上，至會議結束時亦仍未解決。　同時，葛羅米柯大使事先未作任何通知，突向指導委員會提出一點，就是組成蘇維埃聯邦的十六共和國俱應作爲聯合國組織的基本會員國。所以。蘇聯可有十六個投票權。這個提案使史坦蒂紐斯和賈德幹（按即英代表團團長）瞠目不知所對。但他們立即吿訴他說，他的提議將引起極大困難。　史坦蒂紐斯把公事報吿總統時，總統堅決地說，美國無論如何不能接受此議。他呌史坦蒂紐斯向葛羅米柯說明，此事將引起說不盡的麻煩，若可同意讓組成蘇維埃聯邦的十六國加入，則我們要求美洲聯邦的四十八洲一一加入，亦可一樣的合乎邏輯了。</p>
<p>史坦蒂紐斯把此事報吿我時，我說，聰見有此提議，我不勝訝異。我又說，我們從事戰後計劃的美國人員中，腦子裏從未想到此一問題。我結論說，我必以全力反對。</p>
<p>八月廿九日，史坦蒂紐斯把他跟總統與我談話的結果，吿知葛羅米柯說，我們認爲這個提議係在議程以外，此時若予堅持，必將阻撓大會的成功。史坦蒂紐斯請葛羅米柯收回這個提議，並且說，如果蘇聯政府有此存心，應該在聯合國機構成立後於理事會中提出，當更爲適當。</p>
<p>葛羅米柯很能合作。他說，他的提出此點，只不過是吿訴我們和英國，他的政府有這麽一個意思在腦中。他同意在會議期中不再提及此案。然而，他暗示說，在其他時機，蘇聯政府可能再度提出這個問題。</p>
<p>蘇聯政府竟有這麼一個多個會員國的問題在腦中，這個事實令人頗感煩惱。我於是請葛羅米柯大使於八月三十一日來看我，會晤時，我很坦白地告訴他，對於他代表其政府所提出的這個問題，我所持的反對的理由。　我對他說，他這個提議將使「一切吿吹」。我說，大國於該組織中旣將居領導地位並貢獻軍事力量，則必可毫無困難地使自己的見解受他國注意，不論它們是有一個投票權還是許多投票權。美國不想有一個以上的投票權，但我們感覺，由於我們的力量，必可於任何時機確表自己的意見。</p>
<p>同日，我們在國務院預備好了一個總統爲此事發給史達林的電報。總統核准了，但加上一句說，我們的立塲並不影響以後聯合國機構成立後對於此問題的討論，那時，該機構可有充分權力處理這個問題。　這個蘇聯多要投票權的問題，至會議將結束時，葛羅米柯曾又提及一次，以後，直至一九四四年十一月間我辭職時止，迄未聞提及。蘇聯代表亦從未與我提起過他們後來所要求的讓白俄羅斯和烏克蘭入會一事，這一點，羅斯福總統在雅爾達會議中是同意了的。如果他們先前曾向我提出，我定必反對。</p>
<p>在會議一切討論中，我們竭力把這個提議嚴守秘密。即使在我們自己的備忘錄中，我們也只把它稱之爲「某事」。我覺得，這件事情是如此的富於爆炸性，如果洩漏於外，定必將被各處的反對勢力渲染利用，來損害蘇聯和整個會議的處境。</p>
<p>九月六日，我和史坦蒂紐斯與總統會晤於白宮，討論鄧巴頓橡樹會議中正在討論的各項主要問題。羅斯福總統首先提到新組織的會址問題。他認爲該組織的各個機構應於世界各地舉行會議。</p>
<p>他覺得新組織的秘書處可設於日內瓦，但大會及理事會的會議皆不可在該地舉行，他相信大會應每年換一地方舉行會議，理事會則或需兩處固定的會議地點，一在大西洋中部的阿索爾島（Azores），一在太平洋中部夏威夷羣島中的一島。他感覺國際法庭仍應回到海牙。</p>
<p>總統於述說此等意見時是很、認眞的，他還說，準備於該月下旬去魁貝克舉行第二次魁貝克會議時和邱吉爾首相一談。國務院準備好了關於阿索爾島與夏威夷的尼霍島（Island　of　Niihau）的地圖與節略，總統預備把它們帶到魁貝克去。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統對於聯合國會址的問題，曾煞費研究，他把自已關於此事的意見吿我，這也並非首次。他覺得把理事會放在阿索爾或夏威夷羣島可有一種與世界保持距離的好處。總統本性是個海重出身的人，他喜歡從海中孤島上去看世界。在一九三幾年的後期，他曾竭想舉行一次各國巨頭的會議，在軍艦上，或是海島上，如阿索爾羣島之類。他覺得理事會若遠處海中，即不會受到任何一國壓力的影響。他回憶到巴黎和會，以及因在一個大國首都舉行會議而致遭受的壓力。他覺得國際聯盟在遷至日內瓦前，設於倫敦的時候，即曾受到壓力的影響。</p>
<p>他說，在性質上，他希望建立一個國際哥倫比亞區之類的東西。（我常發覺，總統於叙述國際問題的意見時，喜以美國本身的情形作比。最顯著的例子是他一九四〇和一九四一年間各次演講中，他把軸心國家飛機的可以輕易自達加飛至巴西，比擬爲可自美國的一城輕易飛至另一城。）</p>
<p>但是，把一個國際機構四散分設於仳界各地，究竟是一件不甚合乎邏輯的事情，所以在鄧巴頓橡樹會議中，我們從未認眞堅持過這些意見。無論如何，這不是四强可以決定的問題，而是應該由未來組織的全體會員國來決定的。</p>
<p>我們也和總統討論到蘇聯的這個提議，就是於聯合國組織下建立國際空軍，由安全理事會指揮。史坦蒂紐斯和我解釋美國代表團的立塲說，我們應該反對建立國際空軍，而提出我們的建議，由各國自組空軍小隊，有事一經通知，即可到達混合的機塲上執行任務。這個建議，是和總統六月十五日所作的不擬成立國際警備軍的聲明立塲一致的。總統同意我們應堅持此一立塲。史坦蒂紐斯對總統說，邱吉爾首相或將於魁貝克跟他提及此一問題，因爲我們聽說，邱吉爾首相對蘇聯的這個建議似乎印象頗深</p>
<p>我們又討論到另一個蘇聯提出的建議，就是凡不能貢獻空軍給安全組織的諸小國，應貢獻土地作為基地。總統和我都強烈反對這個規定，因為這是侵犯了小國的主權。我們覺得這種行動應完全出於自主，小國不能被迫貢獻基地。但蘇聯的意見，曾於鄧巴頓橡樹會議的建議案中予以相當的承認，其中主張成立特別協定，規定供給「設備」，武力以及其他協助，由安理會處置。</p>
<p>其時我們提及此一新國際組織時，時常稱之爲「聯合國」。在我們的某些草案中，我們早就一直用此名稱。總統認爲即應以此作爲新組織的名稱，我們也覺得，四十餘國在此名詞下共同作戰終獲勝利，這當是一個幸運的名詞，可在它們勝利以後仍在其下共同合作。但當史坦蒂紐斯在會議中提出此案時，我們却遭逢到了蘇聯和英國出乎意外的反對。葛羅米柯暫時建議用「世界聯盟」這個名詞。賈德幹說，他不信英國政府會特別喜歡「聯合國」這個名詞，並曾想建義一個名詞，其中包括有「聯盟」一詞的。（按數日後蘇聯與英國都皆接受了「聯合國」這個名稱。）</p>
<h3>美駐南韓代表斥北韓共產化</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城三日電〕美國務院駐南朝鮮代表昨日發表吿朝鮮愛國人士書，首謂：「在對日戰爭中，美國之犧牲最大，而蘇聯僅在日本投降前參加對日戰爭」，其意蓋指今日以卅八度綫平分朝鮮佔領實欠公平。繼謂：「卅八度綫之封鎖實有碍朝鮮之自由發展，現聯合國已決議努力實現廢除三十八度綫之封鎖」。該書中並大聲疾呼，喚醒朝鮮愛國人士勿中共產主義宣傳之毒。並謂：「由於共產主義者最高司令部之命令，北朝鮮已共產化，並進而至南朝鮮進行共產化。最近南朝鮮之暴動事件及種種惡意宣傳，即係由此項命令而發生」。最後美代表更喚起北朝鮮人民收聽南朝鮮美方廣播，以便隨時傳達意見。</p>
<h3>日新閣實權仍操諸社會黨</h3>
<p>三黨閣僚分配大致決定</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京三日電〕日民主黨組閣工作現已進至交涉入閣閣僚階段，一般認爲必至五日，一般人選始能作最後決定，今日民主黨總裁蘆田曾分別訪問片山與三木，正式請求社會及國協兩黨提出入閣名單。據悉：關於閣席分配問題，大致已決定，其比例爲民七（包括首相在內），社八，國二。民主黨分得大藏，運輸，遞信，及不管部閣員三席，社會黨分得外務，農村，商工，勞働，文部，及不管部閣員三席，國協黨分得厚生及不管部閣員一席。其他以不管部大臣兼任之重要位置，民主黨分得內閣秘書長及建設院總裁，社會黨分得經濟安定本部及法務廳總裁，以如此分配及比例言，蘆田內閣之實權仍握於社會黨之堂中。</p>
<h3>對日盟管會　美蘇互相指摘</h3>

<p>〔合衆社東京三日電〕美國三日指控蘇聯干涉日本政府之組織，同時蘇聯要求業獲美國同意當選之新首相蘆田應受整肅，不准參加政治活動。美蘇之互相指摘，係發生於盟國管制日本委員會會頗中，中國及美國代表支持美國對蘇之控訴。蘇代表吉斯倫柯少將在會中宣讀八頁長之文件，稱日本之經濟危機日益加深，而佔領軍當即拒絕組織代表大多數人民之政府，幣原吉田片山諸內閣，均無能爲力，不思解救經濟危機。吉氏又稱：前數屆內閣中有多人應受整肅，然均在位不去。渠乃宣讀一連串之人名，蘆田亦在其內。至是會議主席美代表施巴德乃阻吉氏繼續誦讀而反詰稱：蘇代表有何權干預日本內閣之組織，管委會無權討論日本之政治人物。施氏稱，佔領政策規定，日本新的民主政府，應由人民之自由意志產生。渠又稱：此時討論日本政治人物，將影響組織內閣上之自由選擇。吉氏指斥施巴德剝奪其發表有關佔領事項意見之權利。施氏答稱：如蘇聯希望提起比事，有專門之整備委員會在，然吉氏宣稱，除開管委全外拒絕與任何機構接觸。施氏又稱：麥帥之所以批准蘆田任首相，蓋根據民主之程序。</p>

<h3>公共汽車一度停駛　伙夫肇事傷查票師管區秉公處理　當夜圓滿解決扣押三人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行駛外灘長陽路間之四路公共汽車，昨日下午五時許，因四十五號査票員與師管區司令部一伙夫在大連路發生衝突，査票員被毆受傷，引起全路車輛停駛，同時七路十一路等車輛亦繼起響應，一時事態頗為嚴重，後由師管區司令述夜組織軍法會審，直至今晨一時半始解決。</p>
<p>此事之起因，係師管區司令部一伙夫名謝代盛者，於昨日下午五時十分在許昌路無票搭乘四路第三五八號公共汽車，於大連路華德路下車之際，遇第四十五號査票員鄒利仁。鄒査得其無票，又以其僅穿灰色軍便服，詢其有何符號，謝出三十六年舊符號相示，鄒以業已過期，不能生效，遂發生爭吵。鄒旋在附近大連汽車行內，借打電話至公司，擬請示處置辦法。時謝已邀來五六人論理，當時一言不合，即由爭吵而至毆打。在塲雖有一三八六號警士代爲排解，但勸止無效。而鄒利仁終因衆寡不敵，即被毆傷倒地，復被挾往師管區司令部內。時師管區副司令陸軍少將梅展翼業已聞訊，大爲震怒，除將謝扣押外，對受傷之查票負當塲表示歉意，並表示願負一切醫藥等費之賠償責任。時四路七路十一路公共汽車全體職工咸已罷駛，並提出三項要求：（一）要求警備部懲辦肇禍士兵，（二）負責傷者全部醫藥費，（三）道歉並保障以後不再發生同樣事件。</p>
<p>師管區司令部當時即在肇事地點之大迎路大中國菜館內臨時組織軍事法庭，由副司令梅展翼，參謀主任高寳書，軍法官呂征强，毛炎離舉行會審。首先傳訊鄒利仁，但以受傷發音低微，另由交通組副組長丁慰堂代爲轉達經過情形。繼傳詢設人一三八六號警員後，即將肇事者謝代盛提出審詢。謝已加以五花大綁，當由各長官輪流審問，由謝供出參加毆打者尙有鍾士養王朝德兩人。審問至今晨一時始畢。謝及鍾士養，王朝德三人當塲收押。傷者送公濟醫院醫治，聞傷勢尙無大碍。</p>
<p>至公共汽車公司方面所提出之三項要求，均經師管區梅副司令全部接受，於是一塲糾紛，至此亦吿圓滿解決。</p>
<h3>任顯羣談配米價格　不能過低使成倒流　限五日前發齊配證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市自三月份起，實施全面配米後，因米源問題，配米證分上下半月兩期發給，上半月配米證原限於三日前發淸，惟因各區保田辦事手續遲緩，至今有尙未領得者，影饗配米工作殊鉅。民食調配會宇委任顯羣定於今午在招商局六樓邀宴全市卅區區長，請督促區保甲人員加緊工作，必須將配米證於五日前發交市民。下半月配米證現亦在加工印刷中，定六日至八日發交市民。調配會爲加强督導工作，每區將設駐區督導一人，就地督促。此外並有巡迴督導多人輪流至各區監視，以防流弊及加强工作效率。該會分配處組織，業經決定爲處長周一鶚，副處長吉明齋，高君良。下分設零售商店管理，發證，設計，倉庫管理，督導等五科。</p>
<p>政策已收成效</p>
<p>日來外界對配米價格每石二百四十萬元，因與市價相差無幾，頗多非議。記者特往訪民食調配會主任委員任顯羣。據談：配米之意義初步，在穩定經濟基礎，使延長波動之週期性，並收回法幣頭寸，以减少發行數額。因之配米價必須迎合市價，規定最高不得低於市價百分之五。美國救濟物資係全國性，並非祗限京。滬·平·津·穗五市。現在五市配米所得，即作爲全國性之救濟費用，促使中國經濟初步穩定，進而着手改革幣制。據統計：三十六年上海米市塲平均每月供給每一市民之米糊祗六升一合二，但每一市民每月之平均消耗量爲一斗五升，消耗量三分之二係不經市塲而直接流至消費者之手中</p>
<p>榖賤傷農堪虞</p>
<p>現政府每月供應上海市五十萬担配售，除外人食麵包及北方人食麵粉外，約佔上海市每月需要米糧三分之二，已具有決定性力址。如此即使其他三分之一米源價格有波動，亦不怕漲至何種程度。觀此三日來之米價回小，配米政策已收成效。上海市爲食米消費區，不能使米價較產區爲低，否則形成倒流現象，後果嚴重。目前吾人應硏究者有二點：（一）使米價不能領導其他物價上漲，在此原則下，合理調節米價。（二）不能使米價過份低落，俾可鼓勵商人採運。而榖賤傷農，亦須顧到，如農人種稻收穫不數成本，放棄生產，後果可慮。現今長江上游各地米價多較本市爲高，如所定配價二百四十萬元予以减低，則控制市場之力量减少，政策脫即，將形成倒流現象。故减低配米價格實屬不可能。又據任主委稱：本市三月份配米，共可收入一萬二千億。</p>
<h3>憲兵第九團抵滬　本市防務益鞏固</h3>
<p>憲兵第九團奉令調駐上海，已於三日由無錫乘車抵滬。據悉：本市蘇州河以北地區防務，將由第九團之第二營負責，蘇州河以南防務，仍由獨立第三營負責。獨三營歸第九團統一指揮。本市防務因此益形鞏固。第九團並負責滬杭，浙贛兩路沿綫之警衛。至京滬沿綫各地之防務，改由憲一團負責，惟京滬押車勤務，仍由第九團派員担任。</p>
<p>淞滬警備司令部，各界招待慰勞過境出征軍人委員會，上海師管區，上海團管區，空軍供應司令部，吳淞要塞司令部，軍校畢業生調査處，兵役協會，軍之友社等機關團體，爲歡送港口司令施北衡，海軍第一基地司令方瑩，歡迎新任港口司令周力行，海軍基地司令董沐曾，及憲九團羅團長，昨特舉行籌備會。由謝仁釗主特開會，決定五日午後二時，假軍之友社舉行茶會歡送歡迎。推方治，潘公展，宣鐵吾，傳正模，邵百昌，謝仁釗，王衛民爲主席團。</p>

<h3>經濟動盪中的上海公用事業　市民負担的分析　種種可能的出路</h3>
<p>— 趙曾珏</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>我國戰後經濟動盪的劇烈，超過戰時，各種人生日用必需品價格，節節上漲，漫無止境，大多數人民莫不感受嚴與威脅。即就水電，交通，煤氣，電話等公用事業的享用而言，亦感不勝負担。因爲物價的控制，不是地方政府局部所可解決。我們身負市政責任的人，在這個整個經濟動盪的大環境中，很難覓得安定的方策，實在感到萬分焦灼！本篇所建議的無非要根據事實及需要，就正於國內明達。</p>
<p>（一）上海一般物價的上漲率</p>
<p>上海是全國最大市塲，對於經濟的感受性，自然更較敏銳。復興兩年半以來，我們檢閱本市零售國貨價格的指數，（下表根據市府統計處所編以二十六年一月至六月物價作爲基數）就可明瞭物價上漲率的一斑：</p>
<p>上表指出三十七年一月份一般物價比較戰前上漲十一萬借至二十五萬倍之鉅。値得注意的是時期愈後，上漲的比率愈高；即公用事業有關各項因素的上漲率（比較二十六年增加的倍數）也有同樣的趨勢。試看下表：</p>
<p>（二）上海公用事業價格的上漲率</p>
<p>在物價波動這樣劇烈的情况之下，要維持公用事業，並求其服務的改進除了核算成本調整價格外，第二辦法便是維持原價，由政府施行貼補。本市的公用事業，在三十六年三月至五月曾一度實行貼補，嗣以未能阻止物價上漲，而貼補數額愈來愈大，行政院於六月宣吿取消，仍將價格逐步調整。其上漲率（比較二十六年增加之倍數）如下表：</p>
<p>由上列統計，値得注意的，是卅七年一月份公用事業的上漲平均率爲五萬九千倍，而同月份直接影響公用事業價格谷因素的平均上漲率，已達十萬零四千倍，物價總指數的上漲率更達十五萬倍以上。公用事業是否領導物價上漲，不　自明。</p>
<p>（三）計算公式及公用局的責任</p>
<p>公用事業是整個經濟的一環，整個經濟旣然劇烈的變動，公用事業價格，自無法不隨之變動；但其變動是被動的，而非主動的。因爲有關公用事業成本之各項主要因素的，價格，均分別由各主管機關所決定的。例如生活指數是每月由上海市生活指數審核委員會所審核決定的。金屬類的物價指數，是由市政府統計處根據金屬物市價所編定的；煤斤價格是經濟部燃料管理委員會所核定的；油料價格，是輸出入管理委員會所核定的；外匯價格，是中央銀行所掛牌公布的。這種種的價格上漲，影響公用事業成本之增加，欲使其得以維持業務，因之不得不調整其價格。計算公用事業的價格，須備具一套公正的公式。這個公式，由全國經濟委員會根據各公用事業統計而擬定。草案送到上海後，幷經本市政府分別會同參議會代表李文杰汪竹一兩先生及公司的代表三方面修正後，再由經委會彙案制定最後的公式，呈由行政院頒佈，全國一致實行。這種公式的主要部份，可分爲「基數」及「因數」。「基數」爲根據統計而得，如每度電須耗幾磅煤，是相當固定的。「因數」是變動的，如每磅煤的現値。若午基數乘因數之積，分別乘以百分比，總和起來，就得到每度電的成本。公用局的努力和責任，在盡力督促各公用事業提高效率，减低「基數」。其他各「因數」，如生活指數，煤價，油價，及外匯等，不在公用局控制範圍，祗能希望其他有關機關的盡力管制。在經濟動盪中，公用局的一貫政策，盡量使公用事業穩定，在卅五年的下半年，吾們曾做到，所以在卅六年初大公報的民意測驗，對此表示滿意。在卅六年六月後物價的上漲如脫　之馬，公用局的政策是要使公用事業得以維持，可準漲價但要有規則的漲，每月至多一次，同時須顧到市民的負擔，保持核减的權。所以當每月我們審議公用事業照公式計算所得價格時，市參議會是亦有代表三人參加，，仍竭力抑低，無非要責成各公用事業自動提高效率，减低「基數」，甚至公用局考核人工的「基數」，責令某一公用事業公司不得再添任何員工，以節人工的開支。爲什麽？就是爲了顧到市民的負擔，觀下表即可明瞭。公用局的最高原則，是「不忘記市民，不祖護公司」。吾相信市參議會與市政府具有共同的願望，所作所爲，要對得住市民；同時保持公正的立塲，要折服各公用事業公司，使無怨言。</p>
<p>本年二月份比一月份各項主要因數之增加率</p>
<p>照此比率，推算各項公用事業二月份應加之百分率，應比現在實際之價格爲高，試閱下表：</p>
<p>（四）市民感受性之差別</p>
<p>近年來一般人的收入，因幣値的貶落，就數字講，當然也在繼續增加。假若每人的收入，都照戰前底數每月依照生活指數計算，那就毫無問題。可是事實上，千差萬別，各各不同，因此各人感受物價壓迫的程度，乃至感受公用事業價格壓迫的程度，也就大有差別。例如戰前勞工最低工資爲每月十六元，現則底薪增至三十七元，如依一月份工人生活指數九萬二千餘倍計，每月工資實收三百四十萬元以上，比戰前增加二十萬餘倍。至於公敎人員，以普通月薪一百一元計，按照最近支薪標準，月入祗三百十四萬五千元，比戰前祗增三萬四千五百倍。其他工商業在此市塲混亂經濟不正常的時候，無法推算其收入的倍數，但遠在公敎人員數倍以上，當可斷言。</p>
<p>戰後士農工商四民收入倍數的不同，造成對於公用事業價格感受的不同。市民中有一部份，其所入照生活指數增加者，對於物價的壓迫，尤其對於公用事業價格，感受較輕；惟有所入不照生活指數或不能照指數提高者，其感受物價及公用事業費的壓迫實覺沉重。我們不妨再做一個分析。</p>
<p>在戰前一個中等家庭，住居上海，得到物質的享受，其各項開支所佔收入的成數，大約如下：</p>
<p>房租　二〇％　公用事業費等　二〇％</p>
<p>伙食　二〇％　娛樂及儲蓄　二〇％</p>
<p>衣服　二〇％　總共　一〇〇％</p>
<p>爲更明瞭起見，再以戰前月入二百元的中等家庭所負公用事業的支出，作一簡要的分析如次：</p>
<p>電燈（四〇度）　七·二〇元</p>
<p>自來水（二〇立方公尺）二·二〇元</p>
<p>電話（六五次）　六·五〇元</p>
<p>煤氣（四〇度）　二·四〇元</p>
<p>電車（每日四次）六·〇〇元</p>
<p>總共　三三·三〇元</p>
<p>佔收入之成數　一六·六五％</p>
<p>戰後，這個二百元底　的中等家庭，如係公敎人員，實際收入照中央頒佈辦法計算，本年二月份可得法幣五百五十萬元。工商界照一月份生活指數（九五二〇〇倍）（甲）全部計算的，可得法幣一千九百〇四萬元。（乙）半數照生活指數計算的，可得九百五十萬元。如照一月份之公用事業價格，其支出可分析如下：</p>
<p>電燈（四〇度）　三五〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>自來水（二〇立方公尺）　一七三、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>電話（六〇次）　一四四、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>煤電（四〇度）　九〇〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>電車（月季票）　五六〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>（公敎人員二四〇、〇〇〇）</p>
<p>總共</p>
<p>（公敎人員）　二、一二七、〇〇〇元　一、八〇七、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>佔公敎人員收入之成數　三二％</p>
<p>佔工商界（甲）收入之成數　二、八％</p>
<p>佔工商界（乙）收入之成數　二三、六％</p>
<p>照以上的分析，目前公用事業價格對於市民的感受性，至少可分三類：（一）對於公敎人員感受加倍的負擔，約佔全部支出三分之一，而對於公用事業享受超過此項標準者，其負擔尙超過全部支出三分之一，其生活所需各項開支，照一般情形，大約可分析如下：</p>
<p>房租　六％　公用事業等費　三三％</p>
<p>伙食　五七％　娛樂　二％</p>
<p>衣服　二％　總共　一〇〇％</p>
<p>同時較高級的公敎人員，更感到困難，因為收入不能照底薪直綫比例的增加。（二）對於（甲）種工商界如產業界的職工，公用事業的支出較之戰前在百分比上反而略小，因爲公用事業的平均漲率不過五萬九千倍，而生活指數已達九萬五千倍。（三十七年一月）（三）對於（乙）種工商界，其公用事業費的負担之戰前增加百分之七，比較不太嚴重，後這個分析，除非政府控制物價　有辦法，公敎人員的待遇，還應提高，以求合理。更從而可知，公用事業的價格，是有規則的漲，並無不合理。其所以感受威脅者，乃社會上四　收入的不均。同時整個社會收入能照生活指數計算的尙屬少數，無疑地一般人民仍感到痛苦，這是嚴重的社會經濟問題。不是從公用事業本身單獨打算，所可解決。</p>
<p>（五）可能的出路</p>
<p>根據上面的說明，足見公用事業價格的不穩定，完八是　個經濟動盪的後果。整個經濟體系不健全，一般物價的軌道的不斷上漲，公用事業價格無從獨立穩定。因為經濟體系好比鐘表內的一套齒輪，大齒輪在　進，小齒輪被迫着　動。但吾們在無辦法中仍當尋求辦法，不得不在公用事業小齒輪上加一的减速齒輪，就是運用計算公式時，加以强制的核减，並賣成增加效率，在第（三）節中已經說明。此外，補救辦法還有治標中的治標——補貼，此點可舉兩點分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）直接補貼制度，去年三月至五月曾經試行，但是成效並不好。因爲這個制度內在的缺點，使公用事業依賴政府，不求改進，同時以全國人民的負担貼補上海一市所享受的公用事業，亦不公允。全部直接補貼數字龐大，且按月須調整。</p>
<p>（乙）間接補貼，即將公用事業所用的燃料如煤，油及材料如製水的洋礬　氣等，准由政府以相當穩定的外匯給予兩三個月的結價，使公用事業在成本上不致直接完全受到外匯掛高或物價的波動，漲率可求其减低這個方法比較可以試辦，但在通貨膨脹，法幣貶値的時間，這種措施，必　益困難。如公敎人員配給實物，在去年實施之初，與市價相差不遠，政府貼補數額不多，但不及數月即與市價相去天壤，變爲政府的一大支出。對於交通郵電等事業的貼補政策亦復如此。一且政府因無力支持而取消貼補，上漲之烈，可以預卜。所以此項措施，如須實行，必須無限制的繼續。同時還須由中央銀行的盡力贊助，技術上也許須詳加硏商。</p>

<h3>復旦復員後的繼承者相輝學院巡禮　嘉陵江頭一片廣漠的樂團</h3>
<p>早晨，大氣淸新。從重慶乘遊覽專車到北碚，沿途風景幽美，心神很感暢快。一忽兒，便已到達北碚車站。　穿過整潔的北碚街頭，由輪船碼頭，渡江上岸，慢慢地爬上一百幾十級石頭階梯，於是此身便在夏壩——「天堂」。</p>
<p>夏壩，與華西壩，沙坪壩齊名，同樣是學術文化的發源地。國立復旦大學在這兒奠立了根基，抗戰期間，無論中外，沒有不知道她的。而今復旦復員上海，緊接着新生的私立相輝學院，又在這塊肥美的土地發榮滋畏。　復且路旁的法國梧桐，像兩行雁陣，排列得整整齊齊。兩輛自行車飛奔地追逐着，彷彿在尋覓春光。　溫暖的陽光，照着登輝堂樓頂，玻璃窗上反射出閃閃金光，愈使巍峨的建築物，顯得富麗堂皇。</p>
<p>隨着許逢熙院長從會客室裏踱出，一面走，一面談，替美麗的天堂留下一幅畫像。</p>
<p>精神抖擻</p>
<p>許院長是從前復且大學訓導長，一位著名的心理學家，身體很胖，翹起一個大肚子，說話，走路，威風凜凜，精神抖擻的。　大禮堂上高懸着黨國元老題贈的墨寳：一是林故主席題「德隆洛社」；一是蔣主席題「望重河份」；一是于監察院長題「學以報國」。一排排長櫈上列着學生學號，集會的時候，對號入座，絲毫沒有紊亂現象。考試的試塲就設在這神聖不可侵犯的地方，四週的佈置，充滿了嚴肅的氣氛，威嚴，雄壯！</p>
<p>敎室分散在大禮堂兩側，大大小小總共約有二十間，光綫强弱與窗戶位置都很考究。有兩間大敎室門外走廊上圍滿了學生，俯首帖耳地傾聽着室內的講演，有的急急地記着筆記，有的在嘴角掛上一絲會心的微笑。求知的慾望驅迫着他們，似乎一點兒也不感着腰腿的疲勞。</p>
<p>相輝圖書館書庫內藏書不多，閱覽室呈列的報章雜誌却不算少。但是從門前人們穿梭般地進進出出，從肅靜的室內人們忙碌地伏案工作看來，分外地顯現出「粥少僧多」。許院長也有同樣的感覺，他很坦白地說：「我們最缺乏的是圖書」。記者之友魏首福君，將發起組織「相輝校友會」，籌備募集圖書運動］但願能够早早成功。精神食糧在學府，那種恐慌該是多麼的嚴重！</p>
<p>男生宿舍各齋各室大半門戶都是開放的，家家戶戶門首貼着紅紙對聯，一派新興氣象。女生宿舍大半關門閉戶，庭院各處警衛十分森嚴，「男賓止步」的禁令高貼牆頭，然而，竹籬旁邊却正不少紅男綠女在談着喁喁情話。</p>
<p>靑年福利社內設郵電·交誼。食品。洗漿。理髪……各部門，地方雖小，各藝俱全，經濟，便當。恭彥俱樂部每晚廣播時事與音樂，全校師生一千餘人，團集在這兒，「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」。</p>
<p>體育塲上，兩隊女生在比賽籃球，這時正是七與七之比，打得難解難分，各不相讓。</p>
<p>繞過農塲，綠林深處，是敎授之家——復旦新村。</p>
<p>甘苦共嘗</p>
<p>敎授們研究忙，上課忙，敎授夫人在廚房裏也是同樣地忙。敎育界原是高尙而淸苦的生活，難得的是她們情願甘苦共嘗。</p>
<p>文史系主任張默生先生封翁，項下一部銀鬚，席間大談他抗戰故事，滔滔不絕，精神非常健吒；徐德庵敎授是文字學專家，最喜歡講雙聲疊韵；外文系主任方敬的句句話裏，包含豐富的詩意；周通旦敎授是熊十力大師大弟子，道貌岸然；經濟系主任劉覺民，現任陪都中央日報社長，滿口外交辭令；孫俍工敎授頭髪已經快脫光了；白季眉敎授聲音却仍舊十分響喨。……</p>
<p>學生膳食團，男女生各在一處，粗茶淡飯，很少打「牙祭」。女生膳費最低，上月僅十餘萬元。這兒勤苦儉樸的風氣，最爲流行，西裝洋服並不受人重視。目前計共設有：相伯獎學金，登輝獎助金，唐鳳來獎學金，藍文彬助學金四種。雖然金額不大，得來却是頗不容易，因此一經題名，便身價十倍，無怪乎考試制度能够那麽嚴格了。</p>
<p>新舊各種報刊會社團體，約有數十個。但是總以「學術」爲主，黨派沒有活動餘地，就是同鄉會也在禁止之列。學術獨立，思想自由，是相輝學院最大的特點，這種精神，尤其値得</p>
<p>寒冰館，新聞館一帶房舍，據說今年春季，將用來增設相輝中學。附屬力學小學，也將增加班次。如果聘請得到有名敎授，籌備已久的新聞系，園藝系等立刻就可成立。「相輝大學」，三年期內，定會實現。</p>
<p>敎導長邵秀峯博士，吿訴記者創辦經過情形，十分詳細。臨別，他說：「如今，馬相伯，李登輝老先生都作了古人，本校紀念兩位敎育家的意義更加特別重大喲！」</p>
<p>嘉陵江水不斷地翻滾着綠色的波濤，後浪掀推着前浪。水花輕輕地濺上扁舟，像一顆顆珍珠般光亮。……　當記者溯江而上，踏上到北溫泉去的北溫公路的時候，從山顚埋頭遙望那一片廣漠的樂園，朦朧中，眼簾裘重映出一幕親切的印象。祝福壩上的靑年，像春天的花朶，秋天的果實，永遠茂盛，茁壯！（三十七年二月音維於重慶。）</p>

<h3>香島球報　特別銀牌華隊天下　星島東方得決賽權　星島力勝巴士·東方勇克傑志</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕星期六（廿七日）的足球秩序，按表是特別銀牌準決賽，兩塲打鬥，分在銅鑼灣塲及警察球塲上演，大戰結果，星島贏了巴士，東方壓倒傑志，比數都是二對一，於是變了星東爭覇的局面。乙組戰事，海軍乙以四對一淘汰。巴士乙，南華發奮有爲，三比一擊退中華，將與海乙爭奪乙組的錦標。　先看銅灣畔的戰事，星島巴士決鬥，以陣容去比擬，巴士還不及星島，但虎隊因有宋靈聖傷膝不出，守衛受了影響，前鋒呢，遭遇遇到巴士的後防彎打，何應芬，朱永强先後被碰傷，譚江柏犯規八次，錢熾輝又用拳擊許竟成，同是華隊碰頭，實在不應如斯踢法！</p>
<p>談兩方面的演出，星島在技術和經驗上，都比巴士好，在戰略的運用上，巴士更遜星島一籌。在開戰以後，我們淸楚看出，巴士圖用硬打去制服星島，江柏先碰傷了應芬，跟着勝了一個十二碼球之後，便全師退守，擺出「貼身」的打法，去應付星島，見球便搶，希望保有勝球的局面。可惜巴士的軍師忽略了一點，戰情是九十分鐘，在前半時勝一球，便想退守，沒有攻勢，怎能捱打？果然，在最後十分鐘內，巴士的守將跑得筋疲力盡，雖則再碰傷了朱永强，也終被虎隊平反戰局。</p>
<p>看戰情：祗見緊張，未見精采，一開賽虎隊急湧面前，錦河射斜，兆榮門前失脚失落了一運串的機會。到十四分鐘時，江柏碰傷應芬，混亂中，巴士乘機反擊，碩友得球發射，中柱彈出，文治衝前，給松生一阻，星島被罰十二碼球，碩友罰入。這時，應芬復出與永强易位，踢來活動不似前時，上半塲星島先輸。再戰，巴士滿擬退守，星島却急攻，但巴士擺了人陣，虎隊先後迫得角球六次，一無成就。卅二分鐘過後，永强復被踢傷離塲，看看完了，金海迫得奔前助攻，一次，應分開角球。在巴士腹地混戰，松生亂軍中建功，和局以後，虎隊還是勇進，再迫得角球，錦河開得好，兆榮脚勾入，二比一，星島爭得最後勝利。</p>

<p>警察塲那邊，也是一塲準決賽的爭奪，傑志與東方爭霸，傑志邇來狀况不大活躍，東方却有進步，傑志游華興病後上陣，黃景聰脚傷未愈，更使人担心。</p>
<p>在全戰看來，傑志已盡力應戰，上半塲保持不敗，下半塲又獲先勝，但於兩分鐘內，竟然速負兩球，這一點，傑志的後防是該負責的。本來，一塲勢均力敵的球賽，除了技術之外，還得加上倖運和觀衆的支持。這一戰，情形便是如此，傑志三次射球，均中門柱，觀衆又熱烈的給東方打氣，終能平反戰局。</p>
<p>前半時旣踢成和局，再戰，兩隊便陷入苦鬥，十二分鐘時，東方空營出擊，郭英祺突進，單刀建功，一比〇。卅分鐘過後，兩分鐘內，李德祺獨搶兩關，替東方爭得決賽權，氣走傑志。</p>

<h3>南北市米價回漲　麵粉油糧一致跟進</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨止跌回升，原因爲產地價昂及塲外其他物價均回漲之故。粳秈各檔普升十萬元左右。昨到貨南市登記二九〇五石二斗，北市四〇〇九石。市場做價白粳二八〇萬，特高粳南市二八五萬，北市二九二萬。薄稻南市二八〇萬，北市二八三萬，早稱二七〇萬，羊秈二八五萬</p>

<p>外股昨橡皮股及鋼業見秀，熱股不甚活躍，港電報縮，剌激不甚明顯，怡紗晨開一二四萬，自一二五萬起，步降至一二〇萬，始轉徘徊。洋行帮猶太商均進，證劵帮略　，結果較前收計紙版平平，鋼業漲起半成，餘股榮辱甚微。</p>
<h3>華股高檔盤旋　中絲火柴漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨中途曾因塲外息價見高而起回風，但業中心理殊强，易被拉上，廣帮匯票帮亦來吸收，勢甚俏利。中絲火柴等且吿漲停。</p>

<h3>廠商輸入製品原料　訂定三項補充辦法</h3>

<h3>香煙買多續漲</h3>
<p>昨日香烟市面，晨開時以銀根尙形鬆弛，見低收吸不寂，喊價即吿上踊。更因紙圈及烟葉香料等上漲，成本增加，同業中乘機暢進，業外亦來拉提，市勢更見挺俏。後以永泰和派貨通吿貼出，逢高拋售頗多，但最後十支大英，比上日仍續漲六十五萬，爲七千三百十五萬元。老刀軋升一百五十萬，爲六千二百五十萬元。其餘中外各烟亦均步升二三千至一萬四五千元不等。</p>

<h3>外銷茶穩定</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，食日前微靄曙光，昨因買　逐漸蔓延，致過程依然在醞釀中，價格方面亦頗穩健。至於內銷茶，本街店莊及蘇錫等地，感於去化仍佳，活動之意遂猶　集，但市上存底迄未砌增，供應　　寂寥，交易狹窄如故，而市氣則迂迴益堅。</p>

<h3>臺幣實行機動性調整後　臺省經濟漸趨安定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕合省府財政廳長嚴家淦氏，於日前下午四時，與台省委馬壽華聯袂飛抵滬。嚴氏昨接見本報記者，承談：此行主要任務，擬向中央接洽台省所需肥料之價格，及分配技術問題。在滬約有二三日之勾留，即將晋京</p>
<p>渠稱：台幣對法幣比價，自本年一月十三日實行機動性之調整後，對合省經濟有極大之帮助。顯著之跡象：（一）一般物價趨向安定，即以最近滬市物價波動，廿支紗自三千餘萬元漲至六千餘萬元，同時合省廿支紗僅自台幣四十餘萬元，漲至五十餘萬元。（二）銀行存款普遍增加百分之肝。台省三家商業銀行存款總額，已增至八十餘億元，合法幣在一萬億元以上。（三）生產事業安定，此係物價金融安定後之必然收穫。（四）內地實業界對台省生產事業之投資興趣增加，已知者有化學工業等項。</p>
<p>記者旋詢以合省公有土地放租制度實施情形，承吿：該項制度，台省於去年即陸續付諸實施。公有土地之放租，佃農僅須在正產收穫額下，繳租百分之二五。實際較內地所實施之二五减租制度，尤爲低廉。俾减輕佃農負擔，改善佃農生活，及生產情形。合省府自實施公有土地放租制後，近更向民間地主，提倡實施二五减租制，俾台省田租，得以普遍减低云。</p>

<h3>右任詩存二集</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>于右任著　大東書局出版</p>
<p>革命黨人的舊體詩，他們的作風，大致可分兩途，一是極力模古，蘊義深微，抒情綿遠，一是運用現代術語，出自天籟，有時代性。前者如章炳麟，譚延關，胡漢民等的詩。後者如黄興，馬君武，徐賺等的詩。這是硏究革命黨人文學者所知的。</p>
<p>最近讀到于右任氏的「右任詩存二集」，他的詩，運用現代術語，天衣無縫，充分的表現時代性，正義感，在文學上說，純是革命黨人的革命文學，二十世紀大時代中產生的詩歌。與有些詩人的作品，可以放入百年前的詩集，或是八九百年前的詩集裏，也不容易分出他的時代或什麼作者的，是截然兩途。在我的記憶中，于氏的詩集印行，這次似是第四次，而最豐富的一次，是推王陸一所箋注的「右任詩存箋」了。可是這一册「右任詩存二集」，所收的作品，大多數是屬於抗戰時期。他是從民國廿二年起至卅五年，嚴格說起來，自九一八後，我國已開始抗戰了。故此詩集，可以說是于氏的抗戰詩史。而且其中與抗戰有關的吟咏佔了多數，因此，抗戰詩史的定論，是最適合的。</p>
<p>三十四年他的生日，他寫了七絕兩首，詩云：「耕牧河山願未酬，渡江亡命作春秋。今年偶遇勞工節，做砲孤兒巳白頭。」「誕降之辰罹百憂，中山世系削琉球；同盟爭起全人類，不獨歌呼爲亞洲。」這不啻是于氏的自傳。因爲他出世的時候，正値淸室昏庸，朝政腐敗，外患日逼，所以他在靑年時期，即抱着耕牧山河的大志。做砲孤兒，是他出世不久，太夫人去世，由伯母撫育寄食外祖家，幼年曾做紙砲手工，故有此詩。</p>
<p>中秋薄暮黄陂道中見傷兵的詩，在悲天憫人中，更有奮起殺敵的精神，詩云：「傷兵歎息復歎息，日之夕矣月復出。蟀詬人間愛賞月，不知敵機乘月傷吾骨。明月闌，吾骨酸；明月殘，吾骨寒。民族生命爭一綫，吾身幸參神聖戰。軍前歌舞作中秋，獨惜更番不得見。今宵明月圓又圓，定是吾軍破胡天。破胡天，破胡天，吾軀甘願爲國捐。」此中有人，如聞其聲。</p>
<p>詩後幷附有詞曲，這些作品，也是和詩同樣的時代性，異曲同工，絕無一些規模狹隘，枯澀詞句，他是在聲家競起，萬派爭流的時期，創製新體的詩詞曲，來應時會，給文藝界一個模範。他的胸襟意境，如技巧的誠中形外，我們從他的作品裏都可以領會到的。今把民廿七年，他的鄉人訪他，談述故鄕家山的壯麗，勸他北歸。他用金縷曲調作詞來答，訶云：「百事從頭起，數髯翁，平生湖海，故人餘幾？褒鄂應劉寒之友，多少成仁去矣！到今日，風雲誰倚？，人說家山眞壯麗，好家山，須費工夫理。南與北，況多壘。乾坤大戰前無比。愧余生，嵯峨山下，衛公同里。不作名儒兼名將，白首沈吟有以。料當世，知君何似！聞道傷亡三百萬，更甘心，血染開天史。求祖國，自由耳。」公爾忘私，浩氣萬丈冲霄漢的吐屬。</p>
<p>曲呢，把題章太炎的遺像一首做代表吧。于氏辦上海神州日報時，著名神州舊主。民吁報被淸更封閉，他到東京，章太炎對他說：「我也易神州舊主，怎能不助你！」曲是〔雙調撥不斷〕令，曲云：「自民呼，及民吁，當年共作神州主。埀老請囚戲本初，傷時擲筆哭漁父。到此時先生知否？」按本初是指袁世凱，一漁父是指宋敎仁。</p>
<p>我們看了于氏的詩詞曲，雖屬鼎嘗一臠，也可以例其他了。是時代的呼聲，是血性的文字，充分表現作者的個性。</p>
<p>書中有一點似有可商量的地方，就是作品中有些附有箋注，是用第三者稱呼，却沒有註明是什麽人的附註，於例有點不合。因爲本書只是印明「著作者于右任」而已，希望在再版時加入箋注人的名字，給讀者知道。</p>
<h3>「新叭識論」</h3>
<p>— 蘇仲湘</p>
<p>熊十力著：商務印書館版</p>
<p>「新唯識論」，黄岡熊十力先生著，久於戰前有文言本，筆者曾讀過文言本的連史紙綫裝本，戰時復由熊先生本人及其弟子譒譯成語體本，由商務印書館印行。在文言本上，熊先生說他的著作擬分成二部份，一爲「境論」，論本體，一爲「量論」。論認識論。新論（新唯識論簡稱）文言本即境論部份，量論尙未寫就，迄語體本行世。熊先生又申明倘量論寫成，即另作單行本，於是新論乃不復再冠境論名義。</p>
<p>這是一本有斤兩有價値的哲學書，吃緊，沉重而嚴肅，西諺云：「文如風度」，如果果然，由這本苦心著作也就正可略窺熊先生治學爲人的嚴肅風度。熊先生傾半生學養，鑄成此書，以後便大都以語錄式的短札向人，甚少正式的論著，這是中國思想界近數十年來一大收穫。如果引曹聚仁先生讚馮友蘭先先的說法，這也是中國思想界一近五百年」來的偉大收穫，故其受我國學人的重視，自是意中事。近年來，「新理學」與此書的出現，算是我國哲學界最受人注目的二件大事。就此書所宣說者，其內涵義蘊均遠比馮友蘭先生的新理學爲深狹繁車，而所引起我國學人重視與論列，却僅稍亞於新理學，此書影饗之大，即此可見。</p>
<p>全書分三卷九章，義蘊深沉圓博，自非短短一文所得闡述。大抵是發揮，訂正，而且融合大易與舊唯識，師的議論而自鑄整個的理論系統，以本體假說作「恒轉」，恒轉有「翕」「闢」兩種功能，由闢攝心，由翕攝物，宇宙萬事萬物即是此一翕一闢所成的刹那刹那生滅不息的大流：即用顯體，以體合用，剛健日新，永無疆盡。</p>
<p>對於熊先生此書，我們不作評鑒，並非即是承認此書是無懈可擊的眞理，質直言之，此書爲熊先生畢生積學與苦心的結晶，其遺詞造義均有一定着落，我們自問學養，於大易及唯識所知太少，不能有所置議。我們另外所特別表示喜悅者是，熊先生的努力與風度足爲中國思想界一個新階段的自覺的標幟。</p>
<p>這段意思或非片言可盡，我只擬化申此意。</p>
<p>如果妄加分劃，我以爲近百年來中國思想已經走過三個階段，最初一個階段是自淸宋至五四，那時的學人大抵關於外而泥於內，或是根本不理西洋文化，或者嚷道「中學爲體，西學爲用」。其以中國文化爲主也依然如故。第二階段應該是五四至九一八左右，這時學人的超勢又往往關於內而泥於外，總是主張推翻一切本國文化，而全盤西化。這兩個情形，馮友蘭先生論淸末八，論民初人時，曾加祥細說明。</p>
<p>大抵在這兩個時期的學人，對中西文化的認識有幾個缺點，即是情感底，零碎底，表面底。因為重情感，所以不能客觀地憑理智檢取好壞，而常以個人愛憎于中參雜，綫裝書一律丢入毛房的口號即是一例。因爲是零碎底，故總以偏槪全，沒有整個系統的看法，更談不上自己整個理論的樹立。五四時代人慣于作列表式的比較，如說：「中國文化是靜的，西洋文化是動的，中國文化是道德的，西洋文化是科學的，中國文化是精神的，西洋文化是物質的……等等」（此種說法，于今仍烈）。姑不論這些形容詞的貼切與否，但只用形容詞的排比即想將中西文化劃然分判，這分明是蕪雜而無功的事。又，因爲是表面的，所以不能抉取中西文化有何基本的不同，及何以有如此的不同，二語歸一，也就還是沒有基本深刻而又整個的看法。這些遺憾一直到國勢緊急的時代才漸漸轉變，梁漱溟。馬一浮。張東蓀，馮友蘭等等及熊先生可以作爲這第三階段的代表者。這些學人大抵都於中西文化有了一個通盤而基本的意見，而且自己可以拿出成套的理論。雖有得失，這種趨勢正可寳貴。而「新論」便是其中最光輝的一個例子。在這裏面可以看見熊先生對邏輯的了解，對西洋哲學的個人的整個而獨特的領會，可看見熊先生冷靜思索的結晶，可看見熊先生攝取古印的正統思想及中國的正統思想，作成了一套整個而深刻的系統。不論系統的成敗如何，這部書已代表了中國學人自醒的象徵，代表了中國近代思想第三個階段的特點，而且是最優秀最成功的一個代表者。</p>
<p>對於這樣嚴肅的熊先生，對於這絲毫不爲富貴利達及小功小名所動心的學人及其結晶，我們願鄭重表示敬意。</p>
<h3>讀「中國現代語法」</h3>
<p>— 屛溪</p>
<p>王力著　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>這是册難得的好書，除了還有兩三種同樣的可以輔助作參考外，它差不多是目前唯一値得推荐的討論中國現代語法的書了。這書的性質可以從它的書名上看出，大率言來，是：</p>
<p>（一）中國的我們過去有過不少種研究文法或語法的專書，但是那些書雖以本國的文字和語言爲對象，可是所採擇的方法却純是西方的；自馬氏文通以來的一些書，如章士釗諸人及一般學校所用的，幾乎都只是抄襲些西洋現成的文法原理，分類，和表解。這一册書在本質上說來才是中國的了，它處處絕不牽强地模取到一些西方文法學，並且更多的却完全由於創造，因此很配合着眞正的中國語。</p>
<p>（二）現代的過去的一些中國文法學家往往忽略掉時代的因素，未能從語言學史去把握每一時代的語文特性，故每每攏統地將一些古代的，自四書五經至於稗史小說，都當作硏究的資料，結果旣矛盾孔多，同時又與活的近代語文脫節。那當然不是合理的硏究。在本書中，作者盡力地以現存的語言作爲對像。所以最爲實用，讀的人不至於會誤會出時代的錯覺，或是古而非今。</p>
<p>（三）語法的語言和文字的分歧，在中國比了在西洋尤爲利害，即使在新文學運動成功了後的今日，語言與文字之間的距離也依舊遙遠。所謂語法，從一般的講來，是文言以外的白話文的文法，不過在本書中，更有它轉狹的意義，作者的基本要求是僅限於口語的。口語，有一些只能講，不能寫，故而亦不就是白話文。爲什麽硏究口語的法則呢？大槪是爲了文字是在日逐向此一方位趨往着，要求活生生。</p>
<p>談到中國的語法學，向來是一空頁。較古代的有一些小學之類的專書，最多也不過研究虛字，如經傳釋詞一類的作品，其後，馬建忠的文通是劃時代的了，其實也祗摭拾西方的文法敎條而已，並不能眞正闡述到中國文（語）法的運動規律。此外，有一些人是認爲中國文或中國語是無法則可喩的，爲了它似乎太雜亂，太空幻，或太與西洋的文法不同。接着，由於不少脚踏實地的工作者的努力，中國文法才有一黎明的建基。在新的文語法研究者羣中，王了一先生是一位與呂叔湘先生同具權咸的學者。這一書，在若干方面將奠下不可否定的原則，那無疑義。不過與別的語文法書比較，它也有它的特色，此些特色，大別地講，有：</p>
<p>（一）它是整個地以一單句爲研究個體的，並不先割裂爲字，詞，而後始是討論到句。這是中國文字的特殊性之一，一方面中國字的每一個單字祗有一固定的形狀，不有任何改變，二方面是爲了中國字的性能變化太多，非嵌在一固定的句中去觀察不可。</p>
<p>（二）它是自動地創造出新的術語來應用的，只在某些較無關宏旨或一般的所在才沿用西洋文法的術語，這樣可以免去好多不必要的麻煩。譬如關於名詞，其他的文法書中尙忘不了「性」「數」「位」等的拘索，在此書中都省去。此外，它不大用圖表去說明。</p>
<p>（三）它是活潑地從效用的立塲而出發的。研究中國文法學的大概可分兩派，一派是以形式爲綫路，那是最舊的一派，另一派以文字或語言的意義來考察這一字或詞的性格。本書的作者似乎從別的觀點去究討，處處以文字和語言的效用爲經緯，故而也最合乎實踐。</p>
<p>這書共分上下兩册，六百餘頁，近三十萬字。內容，要介紹，較爲麻煩，同時爲篇幅所不許。關於本書的某些創見和精朵處，書前朱目淸先生的長序中都提到過了，姑不詳。約略言來，這書除導言十頁，講到什麽是語以及什麼是中國語法仕麼是中國現代語法等外，一共分爲六章。第一章「造句法（上）」，舉出字，詞，詞類，詞品，仂語，句子等文字的單位，再談到句子的形式，作者分爲敍述句，描寫句，和判斷句，很合乎中國語文的本性；次一章是上章的繼續，羅列出各種的句法，並予以詳細的檢討，也多發人所未發；第三章是「語法成份」，是針對「理解成份」而言的，凡是除去一些名詞數詞形容詞動詞等使人理解的實詞外，所有祗是使句子的語氣等存在的副詞，代詞，繫詞，聯結詞，語氣詞，和「記號」都被討論；第四章「替代法和稱數法」，最精采，論到每一個日常應用的代名詞和數詞，更指出它們的施用方法；「特殊形式」是中國語法中的一些例外，尤和西洋文法無關，故另置第五章；第六章，也就是最後一章，論「歐化的語法」，指出在智識份子的推動下，中國文字如何地在更易它的性質，如何地使語言變質，如何地與世界語言合流。一般說來，每一章每一節都很完備，末復各附有定義，練習，訂誤，附註，和比較語法，以供學校的實用或個人的自修。</p>
<p>不過本書也有它的缺疵。最重要的是引用材料的不當，因爲紅樓夢等雖是標準語寫的，却總是百年前的語言形態的紀錄，不够現實性；在歐化的討論一段裏，不引翻譯書的句子，亦是失策。其次，並沒有周密地研究到方言，並沒有顧及一般非智識份子和工農的俗語，似乎「文」的氣息超過了「語」。復次，有一些分類太繁瑣了，不能扼要地更本質地將它們併合起來。最末，是作者忽略了人們所說的一些特殊言語，如土話和諺語的法則等，使本書不能更覺得完全。</p>
<p>本書以外，同一作者更有「中國語法理論」一書，內容是偏於理論的，不如本書的偏於規律，較深刻，較更基礎；可惜的是，到今日還未能問世，否則多少可以補充本書原則闡述上的不足</p>
<h3>「陶淵明批評」的批評</h3>
<p>— 張鳴春</p>
<p>蕭望卿著　開明書店出版</p>
<p>我和許多愛好舊詩的人一樣，歡喜陶詩與陶詩比批評。凡與陶詩有關的著作，在旅行能力所可到達的圖書館，一定去參觀；經濟能力所可購買的書報雜誌，一定去購置。</p>
<p>最近讀過蕭望卿先生的陶淵明批評後，想說幾句話。</p>
<p>從梁蕭統直到現在，批評陶詩的人，不下幾百家。遠的不說，回國以來這方面的著作，不妨從梁啓超先生數下去：（一）梁啓超陶淵明。（民國十二年商務初版）。（二）陶淵明專號八期到十二期，凡五期。（民國十五年國學月報。）（三）丁福保陶淵明詩箋註。（民國十六年醫學書局初版）。內有周雲卿蕭統陶淵明傳箋註。（四）傳東華選注陶淵明詩。（民國十六年商務初版。）內有傳訂陶淵明年譜。（五）在兆銘讀陶隨筆（民國卅二年古今雜誌。敵僞期間，曾請人抄寄，惟未註明期數。（六）周作人陶集小記（見苦口甘口。民國州三年太平書局初版。）（七）陳寅恪陶淵明之思想與淸談之關係。（未見全文。）（八）張鳴春陶淵明思想發源於莊周論。（民國卅五年六月廿五日中央日報文史周刊第六期。）陶集誤字考。（民國卅五年六月一日中央日報泱泱。）陶集補註。（民國卅五年六月十八日中央日報泱泱。）（九）郭銀田陶濟的經濟生活。（民國卅五年九月十日中央日報俗泱泱。）陶潛報社會生活。（民國卅五年中央日報泱泱。）陶潛的心靈。（民國卅五年十月十六日中央日報泱泱。）陶潛在詩藝術上的造詣。（民國卅五年十月十七日中央日報泱泱。）陶潛的人生觀與社會觀。（文化先鋒六卷十九期。）（十）朱光潛陶淵明。（民國卅五年十月十三日大公報星期文藝第一二兩期）。（十）（一）孔陽陶淵明和酒。（民國卅六年一月八日中央日報泱泱。）（十）（二）蔣述亮我看陶淵明。（民國卅六年三月十六日大公報星期文藝第二十三期）。（十）（三）徐澄宇說閒情賦。（民國卅六年五月十二日中央日報文史周刊第四十期。）（十）（四）儲皖峰陶淵明述酒詩補註叙。（民國卅六年五月十二日中中央日報文史周刊第四十一期。）（十）（五）鮑光豹陶淵明無絃琴考。（民國卅六年七月十四日中央日報文史周刊第五十期。）（十）（六）郭沫若題畫記。（覓今昔蒲劍。民國卅六年七月海燕書店初版。（是專論屈原與陶淵明的。）（十）（七）蕭望卿陶淵明批評（民國卅六年七月開明版。）</p>
<p>其中較有系統與識見的，我的看法，也要算蕭望卿先生的著作了。就許批評與考證的著作，與字典類書的性質相似，愈是晚也愈見完美吧？我們不妨這樣說，硏究陶淵明的工作，到蕭先生止，似乎已到了可以吿一段落的階段。</p>
<p>蕭先生有魄力的地方，是不妄隨人後無條件的推崇陶的全部詩作，尤其是四言詩。未讀他的「陶淵明四言詩諭」這一章以前，我很擔心，誠恐他把我一向認為已臻藝術極境的「停雲」與「歸鳥」批評得一錢不値。陶詩四言共九首，他指出其中七首的瑕疵。好像獨獨爲我保留了「停雲」與「歸鳥」他又認爲最微妙最完美的兩首詩。我的鑑賞力無形中受過一次考騐。</p>
<p>「停雲」與「歸鳥」將如千古常新的兩隻蘋果，永遠分泌着芳香！</p>
<p>蕭先生對「歸鳥」的解釋，確是抓住了詩人的心靈，迫尋上詩人創作時精神活動的軌跡。這要算全書最精采的一段。</p>
<p>蕭先生對陶淵明的文章部分幾乎沒有一句批評。這就他的書名「陶淵明批評」說，是不周延的。因爲陶淵明的文章，在陶集裏佔着不可忽視的地位。就中國任何古文的選本看，陶的文章有最多的被選機會，這是無須拿統計數字來證明的普遍承認的事實。他的文章雖少而體例甚多，包括遊記，詞賦，傳記，書信，祭文，自祭文。他好像有心替每種體裁留給我們一兩篇範作。以蕭先生的修養，對這方面應有很好的許論。</p>
<p>蕭先生說「陶淵明的硏究到宋朝已有了個綱領」。這是對的。「明淸兩代，沒有什麽新的發展」。只對了一部分。實際上，自鍾嶸以來，幾乎每一個有詩文集傳世的文人，對陶淵明總愛提一提的。明代的歸有光稱「淵明爲古之善處窮者」。淸代的魏伯子曾有「後人學陶，不學其人面學其詩，夫陶公之詩豈學其詩所能學者哉」的慨嘆。這些議論，都是補充陶淵明詩話的好資料。</p>
<p>蕭先生又說「元朝關於這方面的材料此時一點也找不着。」要知我們只在元遺山的集子裏，便可以找到很多。而且有專論陶淵明的絕句：「一新天然萬古新，豪華落盡見眞淳，北窗白日義皇上，未害淵明是晋人」。我所提出的本不重要，不渦證明示明淸三代却有爲我們所不知道的論陶資料。又就我所知，在陳廷焯的白雨齋詞話裏，王國維的人間詞話裏，魯迅全集裏，吳宓的空軒詩話裏，都有很精到的論陶片語。</p>
<p>蕭先生論陶淵明思想的地方非常中肯。我很佩服他這一段：「……他是接受了儒家持己嚴正和憂勤自任的精神，追慕老莊淸靜自然的境界（却並不走入頽唐玄虛），也點染了佛家的空觀，慈愛與同情，奇怪的是他也兼容游俠的精神。」（原書二二頁）美中不足的，蕭先生在淵明精神的偉大面，闡發較少。「此亦人子也，可善遇之。」（陶淵明傳）。「落地成兄弟，何必骨肉親。」（雜詩）像這一種博愛精神，我們倘能竊其緒餘來做人，一定比徒然在詩上的「效陶」更有意義，更有價値。</p>
<p>蕭先生說「淵明有遊仙詩」，（原書二九頁）並在遊仙詩三字旁加了篇名號。說淵明有些詩有遊仙氣息則可，陶集專斷無遊仙詩的專篇的。</p>
<p>總之，這一册三章（第一章陶淵明歷史的影像。第二章陶淵明四言詩論。第三章陶淵明五言詩的藝術）。四十頁的書，是値得一讀的。不獨他的見解可取，而文章也處處洋溢着詩意的。</p>
<h3>全國行政區域簡表</h3>
<p>— 宋實</p>
<p>（內政部編　商務印書館出版）</p>
<p>據說某校招考，考生中有寫瀋陽位於山東省者。高中畢業生尙且如是，何况中等以下的學生？即是一般民衆對於本國疆域和行政系統亦多藕糊。而一方面國家本身區域劃分也在改變：直轄市的增加；蒙古的獨立；東北在省一變爲九省，九省的疆域又經過變動；首都之外又加上陪都，諸如此類使一般人對於行政區域的觀念更加糢糊了。</p>
<p>考其原因不外乎缺少一本正確明顯的行政區域的書籍。坊間的地圖書本差不多皆是東搜西括，拚凑而成的。以至南京城的大小竟有好幾種說法。全國面積究竟是多少？亦無正確的統計。內政部還都後新編的「全國行政區域」的出版，可說是合時之至。雖然其內容如面積人口的數字也不見得十分精確，但至少限度對於行政區域的正名却是很爲需要也是很重要的。同時，有了這末一個綱要做基礎，以後的修殘補闕，至少要比創始時的華路藍縷的工作省力得多。而且原書且申明「每年刊印本書一次」，則以後自可隨時修正勘誤。</p>
<p>本書分全國的行政區域爲三大類。第一類是直轄市，全國共十二市（南京，上海，北平，天津，靑島，漢口，廣州，重慶，西安，瀋陽，大連，哈爾濱）。第二類是省。共分三十五省（江蘇，浙江，安徽，江西，湖北，湖南，四川，西康，雲南，貴州，廣西，廣東，福建，台灣，山東，河北，河南，山西，陜西，甘肅，靑海，新疆，寗夏，綏遠，察哈爾，熱河，遼寗，安東，遼北，吉林，松江，合江，黑龍江，門安，嫩江。）內轄縣二〇一六；省轄市五七；設治局四〇；管理局一；行政督察區二〇九。第三類是地方，亦即指西藏而言。</p>
<p>三類中，當然以第二類最占重要。在省的項目下，共分七欄：計一縣市號數。二，縣市名。三，縣市舊名，並包括簡單的沿革。四，面積。五，全國面積對本省面積的比例。六人口。七，附記。在沿革一項中並略叙原有的名稱及其管轄情形，追溯至淸末爲限。這一點對査考方面頗爲便利。如十一頁江蘇省的吳縣即有：「舊蘇州府附郭首都，民國元年栽府留縣，將長州元和兩縣併入，元年四月又將太湖靖湖兩廳併入……」一段。另外，幾個新設的縣份，也都有極簡單而有用的說明。如二十四頁安徽省立煌縣（紀念衛立煌將軍的戰功），一百三十頁河南省的經扶縣（紀念劉峙將軍的戰功）等。</p>
<p>關於數字方面，雖說不是絕對準確，然而在如今迄無精確統計時，仍不失爲一種準繩。</p>
<p>書的末尾又附有索引，祗要記得省縣市名的第一個字即可按照索引部首筆劃去翻檢載在書上的頁數。印刷，紙張都令人滿意。然爲了使本書更有價値，更切實用起見，筆者尙有幾點意見要請內政部予以採用的，即（一）文字方面，力求其通俗化，要使普通一般民衆都能看得懂，成爲國人應備的一本常識書。（二）書中最好附有一套詳實的地岡，與本書相輔而行以增加國人對本國疆域的槪念。（三）編排不仿節省一點以减輕讀者的負擔。</p>

<h3>恕道新詮</h3>
<p>— 馮日新</p>
<p>孔子一生的哲學基礎，據曾子講是「忠恕」兩字，但忠字無具體解釋，論語「夫子之道忠恕而已矣」句下隨着說「己所不欲，勿施於人」，其實僅使解釋了「恕」字，而忠字落了空。那麼，孔子之道，最有依據的確實注脚只有「己所不欲」兩句了。</p>
<p>可是近來感到這兩句話頗有問題，譬如說今天有人請我吃飯，我是有香烟癮的，偏偏主人是戒烟同志，或根本不會吸，討厭吸，於是我便一直沒有烟抽，（如果我正好忘記帶烟的話。）這豈不是吃了主人已所不欲勿施於人的虧？等到吃起飯來，酒是不能免的，即使不會吃酒的客人，主人也要强迫他吃，好像非使客人醉得一塌糊塗，不算表示敬意，假設對於權位利祿，能够如此大方客氣那就好了，可惜這只能見於尊俎之間，眞使人懷疑中國的禮儀三百成儀三千，都是專在吃喝穿戴上打主意而與大事無涉了。</p>
<p>且說這酒敬到你而前，遇到一位固執的主人，（我曾見過敬酒的人會向客人發誓說：「你若不吃此杯，我便是王八蛋」，這問題有多嚴重）你能不犧牲一下自己的陽胃以答別人之盛意嗎？按這個來估計，主人對於客人，是恕呢，還是不恕？有人在文章中曾爲猜拳發牢騷，當別人唾沫星子亂冒拳頭在你鼻尖上飛來飛去的時節，你若不是個中人，那裏有暇欣賞那「八匹馬」「九連燈」的呼號，恐怕倒是害怕兩偭打起來殃及池魚的心緒居多了。那麽這裏就發生對於酒的看法之不同，如果是好的呢，該不罰輸了的人吃，而應該勝了的人痛飲；如果不好呢，爲什麼把害人的物事敬客？而且强迫人吃？</p>
<p>蓋這裏可以把恕道分爲消極與積極兩方面，「己所不欲勿施於人」，是消極的，「已所欲施於人」是積極的。消極的恕道，固無不可，積極的恕道，則大有疑問，曾子在此，只說了「不欲」，「勿施」，而不說「己欲立而立人己欲達而達人」的話，或者古代聖賢，先已有見及此？夫消極者，內凝者也，如同文法上的Intransitive　verb，其動作不影響於他人，——甚至其最終目的即在不干涉及於他人，所謂不妨礙他人之自由乃眞自由，雖是老調，却有至理也。至於積極的Transitive式，我們可實在不敢恭維，即使是最好最合理的事，事實上也未見得受人歡迎，譬如勸浪子勿吃大烟，勿狂嫖濫賭，往往惹人反唇相議，而此次上海市禁舞，且使社會局的玻璃，器具大遭其瘟，皆此例也。</p>
<p>然而文化愈進步，則屬於積極的恕道工作愈多，一如吾人旣生斯世，就無所逃於天地之間。此中最要命的當然是所謂廣吿和宣傳，不但在文字語言上使你受了炫惑與欺騙，或增加你的麻煩，在方式上亦是强聒而不舍的，即如街頭及隣居之無綫電，久矣夫就有人認爲是最要命的東西，無論你在都市的那一角落，都會碰到這些寃家對頭，不等開門開窗，自會闖入，向你這不點頭的頑石說法！</p>
<p>我常想，若是世界上的人類根本消滅了種族與國家的界限與組織，道德觀念必有若干極大的改變。昔之愛國志士，說不定可能成爲大同罪人。原因就是其進一步的干涉在純自由立塲上說來顯然是百分之百的不合理。固然，這種無政府主義的理想距離現實世界尙感太遠，然而我們若眞的有理性，絕不能不承認此境界之必有一天實現。到了那一天，眞正的恕道或者才可以來臨。</p>
<p>近來政治上的大病是貪汚太多，據我看來，固然有多數人因現環境困難而自陷非義，然而誤於這種積極恕道者，諒亦非少，即如年節饋送，或是苞直公行，完全是行賄的人立仕「誰不愛錢」的觀點上去忖度人心，下級官吏，對於上級也是如此，一方面是攻襲了心理上的弱點，一方面是大家下了渾水，省得你「在湼不淄」。所以說，恕道如果普遍施行起來的話，一定會弄到一團糟，聖人的話，固亦有須「分別觀之者」。</p>
<h3>邀功</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>一個新任的警官急於想立一些功勞，居然遇到了一次機會。原來在他出巡的時候，遇到一件刧案，他立刻用電話報吿警局：「有一男子被另外一羣人所路刧，我已捉住了一人。」</p>
<p>「你提住的人是誰？」警局裏問他。</p>
<p>電話回音是：「就是被刧的那個男人。」</p>
<h3>父親和黑貓</h3>
<p>— 賓如</p>
<p>我很想念我的父親，因爲當我八歲時，他就去世了。他所給我的最大印象只有一次：他睡在籐榻上，薈白而淸瘦的臉，頷下有五六寸長的鬍鬚，他一手撫着躺在他腹上的黑貓，一手弄着他的鬍子，說：</p>
<p>「小盈！拍皮球。」</p>
<p>小盈是我的小名，我就拍起皮球來了。但只三四下，球便失去控制，跳進了籐榻底下，我一頭撞去，跌在榻旁，父親一面哈哈大笑，一面攙我起來，捧着我頭說：</p>
<p>「拍三下已經很好了，有磕痛嗎？」</p>
<p>那年我七歲，第二年，父親就死了。</p>
<p>父親死後，我就特別喜歡那隻黑貓，因為我只記得牠時常睡在父親身上。</p>
<p>十歲的時候我被親戚帶到北京去念了十個月的書，十一歲時我又回到了家鄕，家中連黑貓也死了。</p>
<h3>童心</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>三歲的茀洛拉有發怒的脾氣，她白天不想吃東西，晚上父母親睡了以後却胃口極好。因此孩子用尖聲吵醒父母親，使他們必在床上餵食，生活弄得極不正常，苦惱非凡。他們想不理睬她，打她，和她解釋，可是沒有結果。</p>
<p>茀洛拉似乎很歡喜她的小妹妹，父親雖非心理學家，特爲給她預備了一間玩具室。這間玩具室沒有屋頂，其中有小型傢俱，並有代表着一個家庭的全套洋娃娃——一個算父親，一個母親，一個女孩，還有一個是小妹妹。</p>
<p>最初，她先把四個玩具娃娃放到床上，於是抱起小妹妹，拍着娃娃睡覺。接着，她把女孩放在父親娃娃和母親娃娃中間，露出滿足的笑意。</p>
<p>結果還是一種嫉妒性。女孩代表她自已，能够睡在父母親一起，而把小妹妹另外睡在一個地方。茀洛拉把這種嫉妒性用另外一種形式發洩憤怒，結果便是晚上大吵大鬧，要吃東西。</p>
<p>父母親如能研究孩子怎樣玩要，可以知道孩子們大部份性格——恐懼，憎恨，愛，疑慮，嫉妒等秘密性格。據心理學家的意見，游戲是年輕孩子生活的鏡子，他表示了自己世界中的故事，顯露了對於他的家庭，別的孩子，尤其是對於他自己的所思所感。</p>
<p>例如有一個孩子，名呌瓊，今年七歲，因爲她不愉快和煩惱，施以心理診療。她容易發怒，不思茶飯。心理學家把她送入一間游戲室，她立刻塗抹了許多粗率的圖畫。其中有一幅是畫着一所屋子，門是關緊的，門外站着一個小女孩。還有一棵樹，一輛火車頭。心理學家知道了她的苦悶，開始發問：</p>
<p>「我不知道圖書裏的女孩子是誰？」</p>
<p>沒有回答。</p>
<p>「那孩子太孤寂了吧，是不是？」</p>
<p>瓊點點頭表示同意。</p>
<p>「我想她的名字呌瓊！」</p>
<p>「是的——而那便是她母親的屋子，「孩子說。同時心理學家知道他的疑問已經摸着正確路綫，因此知道了他的整個故事：瓊的父親調往外埠工作，因爲宿舍無着，所以不能帶了家眷同行。孩子有一天聽到她媽媽同鄰居閑談：「如其不是爲了孩子，我早同丈夫一起去了。」</p>
<p>因此瓊覺得自已已被厭棄，而失去了父母之愛，她沒有發洩幽怨的餘地，於是變得不愉快，而且帶着病態了。等她母親知道了瓊的心病所在，瓊的因難便漸趨解除，生活成爲正常了。</p>
<p>所以心理學家認爲游戲不但是有診斷的價値，也是醫治兒童心理錯亂的有效療法。</p>
<h3>舊酒痕</h3>
<p>— 潛廬</p>
<p>前一向寒氣流來襲，甚覺衣單，十餘年來每逢天寒，便糊糊塗塗的把一件舊絲棉袍向身上一披，可是現在實在破得不能再穿了，便搜尋箱底，搜出一件久被遺忘的舊皮袍。雖然陳絲如爛草，然而經過一番調整，還勉强可以應付塲面；襟上酒痕，依然猶在，乃是當年「武陵少年」時代的標幟．十餘年的生活都是勉强對付過去，那有閑情顧慮衣服呢！</p>
<p>在道十年鑼鼓聲裏，我家因物價影饗，一連傷了四口人，醫華喪葬，都是我的經濟和精神的致命打擊。在以前，開門七件事，都尙可以不用關心，而今已成了問題，尤其是兩個人的學費，竟然司農興仰屋之嗟，毫無補救的辦法。</p>
<p>我自從受了打擊之後，只覺得冷淡，頹唐，不感覺人生興趣。家人勸我繼續向外發展，一來可以小補經濟，二來也可以聊寄閑情；但晨我總覺得親友之間，能保特舊有感情的，却都受了「漲」的洗禮，境况都和我差不多了。能飛黄騰達的呢，我總覺得他們見了措大，總不免有幾分今昔不同之感，避之惟恐不速。因此我謅了一句歪詞，是：</p>
<p>「亂世人情添閱歷」。</p>
<p>「舊業已隨征戰盡！」噫！</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十一章　滿腹疑雲　（八七）</p>
<p>忠傑邁進浴室一看，又把衣櫃櫃門打開，看了一看，砰了一聲，把櫃門關上，體門上玻璃磚，碰得震震作響。綺紈看他這種舉動，實在不順眼，仍勉强笑道：「你要提賊呀？」忠傑道：「嘿！賊！我要捉偸花的賊。」說着，對綺紈點一點頭，一屁股坐在沙發上，把兩腿筆直的一伸，睜着兩眼，儘看綺紈臉上。綺紈怔一怔道：「捉偸花的賊，我不懂這話怎麽講？」忠傑道：「你是眞不懂，還是裝糊塗？」綺紈仍搖一搖頭。忠傑道：「綺紈！我們自認識以來，我沒有虧待你吧，你說什麼，我沒有不答應。現在我爲了你，記了一大過，幾乎要罷官丢職，你也應該知道。」綺紈道：「是的，你沒有虧待我，一切都是順從我的意思，我很感激你。可是你說過，你要罷官丟職，這個責任可不在我身上，因為我是被動的。」這幾句話，在綺紈已是十二分客氣，耐住性說的，可是忠傑聽了，險色陡變，用手在茶几上一拍道：「什麽！你是被動的？那末，是我害了你！」綺紈抿着嘴，微微一笑。忠傑把頭點一點道：「好！我愛你，你不愛我，是不是？」綺紈覺得這一句話很不好答應，仍微微一笑。忠傑道：「那也沒問題，我是愛你的，至你愛我不愛我，我且不管，你算是我的人了，我爲你記過，也無所謂，現在，你就跟我走！」綺紈驚異道：「你呌我上那裏去？」忠傑道：「那就不用管，我呌你上那裏去，你就上那裏去。」綺紈道：「那不可能，我沒有跟你的必要。」忠傑把茶几一拍道：「這一下可抓住了！你不打自招，你沒心跟我，你欺騙我！你背地倒貼小白臉，別人吿訴我，我還不信，現在你自己說出來了！」綺紈見忠傑說她倒貼小白險，氣得渾身發抖，說道：「繆處長，你這話怎麽講？請說一個明白。」</p>
<h3>說矛盾</h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>儘管世界上有邏輯學的這一種學問，儘管人們還講究「理智」的思考，矛盾的現象，還是獲見而不一見。</p>
<p>有人苦於不能早起。特地購了一只閙鐘，庶幾準時可以喚醒他，但是他置備了一隻還不够，又去購買第二隻，其原因在於第一只鬧鐘將他鬧醒後，還可以賴在床上，小眠片刻等到第二只閙鐘可叮作響時，方才起身。揆其本意，似在求早起，但又希望能够多睡一會好一會。這是一個頗能獲得我們諒解的例子。</p>
<p>又如假定你是一個從事社會福利工作的人，晨間外出遇雨未携雨具。你想雇車從拋球塲到南京路外灘去，短短一段路程，三輪車夫却向你索價五萬元。你從同情的立場，可以原宥他是一個特殊的例子，而依照人類的常情，往往速帶對一切三輪車夫都發生反感。人心就是如此的矛盾。</p>
<p>的確，矛盾的實例，到處皆是。一個朋友告訴我，一位正當商人要到外國去，難免證件不全，費盡周折，而一個間諜的出身證明書，國籍證，及護照等，也許色色俱全！再者，我一天乘電車經過十六舖，看見一座倉庫的門外高懸着「閑雜人等，不准入內」的照牌，但是大門洞開，正有一個衣衫敝舊的「閑人」模樣的人，在那裏徘徊。</p>
<p>大槪世界存在一天，矛盾也存在一天，永遠不能消除。年輕人常常神往於「無結合可能」的戀人。飛機槍砲等本來是供戰爭用的，但是以「兵不血刃」獲得「不流血的勝利」爲上策。丈夫寗願丢棄賢慧的妻子，受一個「漂亮面孔」的壞女人的愚弄。……這一串例子書不勝書，而本文却不得不在這裏帶住了。</p>
<h3>廠甸滄桑</h3>
<p>— 清雪學園</p>
<p>文化城裏有一條文化街，文化街裏有一座文化商塲。每年舊曆正月之前半個月，照例有所謂「廠甸大會」。此會之盛衰榮枯，則返映時事之滄海桑田。</p>
<p>「文化城」是北平，古老的舊都，數百年政治中心，求名求利的人們，有「羣山萬壑赴荆門」之勢。科舉功名，牢籠全國二十餘省的文人墨客，與之相聯帶之文藝一切，百海朝宗，種爲人文淵藪。自淸末停科舉，至民國成立，政治形態，迭有變遷，但文化方面，舊的傳留旣厚，新的建設亦多。即如十七年國都南遷，北平失去政治領導地位，市面逐漸蕭條，雖是事實，但最高學府，新文化運動發源地之北京大學，巍然存在，此外國立私立各大中小小學之密度，遠超南北各都市。故南京是政治中心，上海是經濟中心，北平是文化中心，鼎足而三，大致無誤。</p>
<p>「文化街」是琉璃廠，在大城以南，正陽門之西，宣武們之東，而正當民國十四年開闢的和平門。和平門外之新華街是由北而南，琉璃廠東西長一里有餘，與新華街成十字交叉式。此處又有個古雅的名兒呌做「海王村」，有兩三朝的史迹，本文不須繁瑣叙述。民國以來，擴展街道，整理市容，又在十字街東偏，修造一座「海王村公園」，形式上是比舊時宏敞多了。此街商店鱗次櫛比，大多數是書店，字畫鋪，古玩舖，筆莊，墨莊，文具店，掌櫃及夥計，大半能談談文墨考據，金石版本，言之津津，昔之風雅官紳，名流高士，於此盤桓，大有佳處。九城各街，文玩圖書店舖甚多，向以琉璃廠爲代表。貨的價格，亦較內城店舖爲昂。舊式書舖之外，上海各大書局如「商務」「中華」「有正」（有正分局於七年前歇業）皆在十字街西，望衡對宇，故又爲南北書業會合集中之地。在昔科舉時代，既占絕大之優勢，後來學校盛興，又與敎育界聯絡，名之曰「文化街」，自是不虛。</p>
<p>「文化商塲」是文化街來頭路北之火神廟，雖廟基不大，建築頗爲整潔，內外三進院子，前後兩院皆一正兩廂帶廊子，最後一層皆北房，各院又皆有夾道可通。每屆正月初四之夕開廟，初五至初七爲火神進香之正日，同時各城的玉器鋪，象牙舖，紅貨舖，金石瓷銅各式古玩舖，書畫筆墨，都到那裏分區租屋，或擺攤，陳設貨品，皆用精緻的「多寳格」，珠光寳氣，光怪陸離，應客之商人店夥皆穿着整齊，態度穩靜，亦能說幾句外國話。顧客則顯宦富紳，太太姨太太小姐少奶奶「洋大人」「洋太太」等，他們不肯到街上大會塲去擴，而喜車馬僕從，趨向廟中，因爲有的是錢，所以買賣做得特別闊氣。門外有「文化商塲」的布吿，其實可以呌做「貴族商塲」。</p>
<p>此廟之生意以民國二三年至八九年間爲「黄金時代」，因爲革命以後，前淸貴族顯宦，或失業，或遷津靑，府第珍物，大批出售，被古玩商收去。而民初的闊軍閥闊財閥，又酷摹風雅，作興弄些古董擺擺玩玩，東交民巷的外國大人，洋行老板瑪丹，又喜愛中國的Curio，自買之外還大批的寄回國去。於是每到正月，廠東門的汽車如雲，把街口擠得風雨不透。商人財源滾滾，不但近二十年衰落的舊都不堪回首，即前淸亦無此特殊的盛景。</p>
<p>古語有云：「隆隆者絕，炎炎者滅。」盛極則衰，亦是常理。民十以來，大借款是早完了，貴重的好東西亦買盡了，闊主顧亦少了。十七年遝都金陵，中外貴人雅人，紛紛南下，舊京百業一年不如一年，尤以「文化街」爲最慘，更以倭亂以來，至今爲甚。</p>
<p>火神廟又曰「東廟」，因在十字街之東，而街西面對海玉村之土地祠爲「西廟」。東廟以珍玩翠玉爲主，書畫爲賓；西廟則以圖書碑版爲主，其他古物爲輔。東廟的生意，最大是「洋莊」，其次闊人富人。洋人在淪陷期內，西洋人大批出走，東洋的矮子來的不少，但矮子以「小氣」著名，况在戰時注重實際應用的物資，而古玩亦實在「缺貨」。所以此八年的東廟，攤則日少，賺錢的不過十之二三。中國人方面倒有僞「財務」（姓汪的）有的是錢，眞肯花錢，無所不玩。無所不收，尤其鷄血，田黄名貴岡章，南園松禪的遺墨，不惜重價，選購必精，商人以財神目之。此外如「王鬍子」「王瞎子」「王孩子」（皆僞委員之頭領）亦各有所好，惟比舊時之貴族之萬戶千門，究屬强弩之末。發「僞」財的商人只有三五家，其餘大半歇業或改業。勝利以來，洋莊方面，衆商眼巴巴的只望著「大老美」，但「老美」戰後來平者，多是兵士，帶錢有限，而最近一年中，又已調離平市，所餘之洋莊主顧，能有幾何。全廠甸中眞是寥如晨星。中國要人又多忙於軍事，華北現在「四郊多壘」，食糧及日用品漲價，游資大半注重實需，珍玩自然受到影響。而火神廟更透着無限凄凉！</p>
<p>「西廟」（土地祠）十餘年前書攤密如林，堆如山，今則一攤不見，空空如也，只廟外靠街牆零散擺擺。全琉璃廠的舊書店關門者十之八九，綫裝珍籍，多當廢紙論斤出售，作造紙材料，那還有甚麽說的！政府雖有撥巨款收買舊書，保存文化之善舉，然此事非一時的「救濟』問題，故舊書業總是悲觀。</p>

<h3>Valiant Nationalist Troops Advancing Rapidly to Suppress Bandits: The West Liao Corridor Imminent to Be Cleared; Siping Facing the Eve of a Major Offensive and Defensive Battle</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 3rd] The local populace is eagerly awaiting reinforcements. Although the Ping-Shen (Beiping-Shenyang) Railway is open to civilian traffic near Xinmin in Shenyang, bandit activity between Xinmin and the Daling River remains rampant. Military authorities announced: The Air Force has been conducting continuous sorties bombing the urban area and coast of Yingkou for days, possibly as a prelude to the landing of reinforcements. The Siping offensive and defensive battle is about to commence. The bandits' front line is at Shuangmiaozhi and Mangniushao Railway Station to the south of Siping, and at Yehe Station to the southeast. Bandit concentrations are also numerous to the southwest of Siping. Siping is on the eve of a major battle. Furthermore, thousands of bandits are moving from Yingkou and Anshan in southern Liaoning towards Benxi. On the evening of the 2nd, bandits infiltrated areas southwest of Benxi. The situation in Benxi is currently at a stalemate. (Excerpt from the "Weekly War Situation Overview" released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, published on the left corner of the second page.)</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Gui Sui, 3rd] It is rumored that in order to salvage the critical situation in the Northeast, Fu Zuoyi has dispatched the Daqingshan Cavalry of the Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army to the Northeast. Furthermore, to counter the Nationalist cavalry, the Hebei Communist bandits have transferred the Kang Jianmin Brigade to Hebei. The traces of the Kang bandits have not been seen in the Jin-Sui border area for two months.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] A strong force of Nationalist troops entering from Shanhaiguan is advancing rapidly along the Beining Line towards the Northeast, clearing out bandits along the way. With overwhelming force, they have successively recovered strongholds such as Dahushan, Goubangzi, and Juliuhe. The West Liao Corridor will soon be cleared.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] Since the news of Nationalist reinforcements entering Shanhaiguan, the bandits entrenched north and south of the Liao River have shown signs of wavering in the past two days. Moreover, with the increasing pressure from our westward-advancing forces, the bandits are now fleeing back to northern Liaoning in disarray. Their attempts to threaten the outskirts of Xinmin and Shenyang have been thwarted.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 3rd] Nationalist forces reported today: The left wing of Fan Hanjie's army corps has advanced from Dahushan and recovered Heishan today. However, the situation in Tieling is serious, and trains from Shenyang cannot reach the area.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Northeastern People in Nanjing Submit Petitions and Proposals; The Executive Yuan Immediately Transfers to Relevant Departments for Study; U.S. Ambassador Will Host a Dinner for Wang Huayi and Others Tonight to Discuss Northeastern Problems</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] Wang Huayi, Zhang Baochi, Tian Yushi, Li Zhonghua, Mi Chunlin, Wang Shuchang, representatives of the Northeastern People's Petition Delegation, along with Zhang Yuanfu, representative of the people of Beiping and Tianjin in the Northeast, Ma Liang, representative of the people of the Northeast in Nanjing, Zhang Xuansan, Zhou Huowen, Liu Zanzhou, Qi Mingfan, and Wan Fulin, began petitioning the Executive Yuan and the Central Standing Committee on the morning of the 3rd and reported on the situation. Vice President Wang and Secretary-General Gan received them at the Executive Yuan, and Wang Huayi attended the Central Standing Committee to report. They submitted petitions and proposals to both institutions, explaining the actual situation. Wang Yunwu replied on behalf of the Executive Yuan that the documents would be transferred to relevant departments for study and a definite response would be given in the short term. After hearing Wang's report, the members of the Central Standing Committee believed that the principles could be fully agreed upon, but the implementation methods would depend on the Executive Yuan's handling by relevant departments. Wang Huayi and others visited Defense Minister Bai Chongxi at 4 PM to reiterate their views on saving the critical situation in the Northeast and returned at 5 PM. It is reported that Bai Chongxi responded to Wang and others at the time, stating: The government's established policy towards the Northeast is unwavering. Please rest assured and trust that the government has the determination and the means. Furthermore, Ambassador Stuart will host a luncheon for Wang Huayi and other representatives of the Northeastern Petition Delegation at 12:30 PM on the morning of the 4th. Wang and the Ambassador have been good friends in the past, and they will likely discuss the Northeastern issue. Huang Jie will host Wang and others at 6 PM on the 4th. The North China 29 Province and City Relief and Reconstruction Association will hold a tea party to welcome them at 2 PM on the 5th. The date of audience with the President is awaiting notification from the Office of the President.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] The Northeastern Petition Delegation's submitted proposals to various parties focus on six key areas: military provisions, currency system, local armed forces, refugee relief, and the selection and appointment of civil and military officials. The oral reports and proposal submissions to relevant authorities are progressing well, as seen in the activities of the 3rd. Furthermore, the petition delegation has received telegrams from various quarters, some encouraging them, and others asking them to convey their respects to the central government. It is learned that the Songjiang Provincial Association in Shenyang sent a telegram mentioning the issue of building local armed forces, indicating that Songjiang Province is prepared to do so and has nominated Xiao Zhaolin and Guan Ruiji to lead the effort. At the same time, they reported that they have united the people of six provinces and two cities north of Songjiang, who unanimously support the construction of local armed forces. In addition, the Songjiang North and Liaonan Pacification Zones' Six Provinces and Two Cities Association in Shenyang sent a telegram stating: The situation in the Northeast is critical, and the central government is urged to take immediate action to save the situation and implement the four proposals. (The delegation's suggestions regarding the improvement of Northeast's financial issues are published in the first column of the second page.)</p>
<h3>New Chairman of Liaoning Province Assumes Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] Wang Tiehan, the chairman of Liaoning Province, assumed office on the 3rd, with the former chairman, Xu Zhen, personally handing over the duties.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of National Defense Orders the Pacification Zones to Collect Historical Materials on the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 3rd] In order to collect military relics and evidence of crimes committed by the Communist army for compiling history and proving the crimes of the Communist army, the Ministry of National Defense has recently drafted a method for publicly soliciting historical materials on the Communist army. It has been circulated to the provinces in the Pacification Zones, instructing them to follow the methods for collecting and compiling historical materials on the War of Resistance, publish them in local gazettes and newspapers, and promptly organize and send them to the Historical and Political Affairs Bureau of the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Chen Yi's Forces in Western Shandong Encircled; The Nationalist Army Will Soon Launch an Annihilation Campaign</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 3rd] The remnants of Chen Yi's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns, which have been encircled in western Shandong, are still trapped in the area east of Juye, including Longguji, Jidoushan, and Hongchuankou. Valiant Nationalist forces are attacking from Cao County, Weiwan, and the south bank of the Yellow River in separate routes. The annihilation campaign will soon be launched.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the remnants of Chen Yi's 8th and 10th Columns in eastern Henan merged with Liu's forces, a portion of them infiltrated Qi County yesterday, while the majority infiltrated the area southwest of Taikang and southeast of Huaiyang. The bandits are extensively destroying roads and bridges. Nationalist forces are jointly pursuing and suppressing them.</p>
<h3>The Strength of Local Militias is Increasing</h3>
<p>All Expenses Borne by the Government</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] Deng Wenyi, the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense, announced at a press conference on the 3rd: The strength of local militia forces is increasing. Recently, it has increased by at least one-third, and all expenses are borne by the government to assist the Nationalist army in combat. Self-defense units organized by the people themselves are not included. The people's self-defense forces are a civilian force that has been developing rapidly in the Pacification Zones. Local governments and armies provide guidance and assistance to the people's self-defense forces, which greatly contributes to the military campaign against the bandits.</p>
<h3>Regarding Election Issues</h3>
<p>Dong Xian Guang Answers Reporter's Inquiries</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Director Dong Xianguang answered questions from reporters regarding the election issues at a press conference on the 3rd. Regarding the announcement of the list of National Assembly representatives and election disputes, Dong stated: (1) The results of the National Assembly elections have been publicly announced by election offices at all levels in accordance with the law. The General Election Office is not legally required to compile and announce a consolidated list. As for the representatives of national professional groups, the votes from various locations needed to be combined and calculated, and the results were not fully reported until the 29th of last month. They will be announced soon. Dong also stated: The Youth Party nominated a total of 387 National Assembly candidates, and the Democratic Socialist Party nominated 453. The Youth Party hoped that the Kuomintang would assist in the election of 300 of their candidates, and the Democratic Socialist Party 260. Including those elected from the Kuomintang and those who were replaced or gave way, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party representatives to the National Assembly can obtain approximately two-thirds or more of their originally hoped-for number of elected candidates.</p>
<h3>Soong Tzu-wen Hosts Reporters</h3>
<p>Provincial Difficulties Successfully Resolved</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen Hosts Reporters</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 3rd] Soong Tzu-wen hosted reporters at 5 PM on the 3rd to report on his trip to Nanjing, stating briefly: The main purpose of this trip was to resolve issues such as food supply, public security, and insufficient administrative expenses in the province, and the results were very satisfactory. The rationing method for the five major cities has now been determined. 50% of the food supply will be provided by American relief supplies, and the remainder will be raised locally. The Guangzhou city government has decided to purchase it from neighboring provinces, and the central government has agreed to provide loans. Regarding public security, the weapons for the five additional police security groups have been received, and the expenses of the Police Security Department will be fully borne by the central government in the future, and this money has already been given priority by the central government. The budget for the province's administrative expenses has also been largely resolved. Regarding the construction of a branch line of the Gouyadong Coal Mine to connect with the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway, agreements have been reached with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications, and funding is not an issue.

<h3>The Chinese Society for Social Research Holds a Meeting to Discuss China's Political and Economic Path; Advocates for Institutionalization of Politics and Democratization of Institutions</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 3rd] The Chinese Society for Social Research, initiated by Qian Changzhao and others, was officially established on the 1st. Yesterday, the society held its first general membership meeting, attended by over forty people. The meeting discussed key points regarding the society's overall position on China's politics, diplomacy, economy, and society, roughly as follows: A. Political Aspects: (1) The basic principles are to institutionalize politics, democratize institutions, and socialize democracy. (2) Rule of law replaces rule of man, selecting people based on institutions, not creating institutions based on people. Equal emphasis is placed on law enforcement and law-making, with constitutional governance being more important than the constitution itself. (3) Government agencies should have independent status within their statutory authority and be legally responsible to the people. (4) Establish a civil service system. Except for political appointees, personnel in government agencies should not engage in political activities. (5) The army belongs to the nation, and soldiers should not interfere in politics. Soldiers who enter politics must first renounce their military status. (Continued on the first column of the second page)</p>
<h3>MacArthur Advocates Military Aid to China; Has Responded to Invitation to Testify</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Colonel Benk, an aide to MacArthur, announced: Regarding Representative Eaton's invitation for MacArthur to express his views on aid to China, MacArthur submitted his response on the evening of the 3rd. He stated that his response may accept the invitation but did not reveal whether his response mentioned MacArthur's views on aid to China. He said that it must wait until Eaton announces this in the United States before it can be announced in Tokyo. [Associated Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The Allied Headquarters in Tokyo has remained silent on MacArthur's attitude towards the invitation from Washington to provide his views on U.S. aid to China to Congress until noon on the 3rd. However, it is generally expected that MacArthur will submit a memorandum expressing his views on the U.S. position in Asia.</p>
<p>Some observers believe that MacArthur might welcome the opportunity to provide a comprehensive statement of his views. They also believe that this statement will be telegraphed to Washington within 24 hours to provide the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is currently considering the issue of aid to China. There is unanimous agreement here that MacArthur will, to the best of his ability, oppose the suggestion that he should personally travel to Washington, as the new Japanese government is about to be formed, elections are about to be held in Korea as decided by the United Nations, and explosive events may occur in China (anti-American sentiment stirred up by the Communist Party could erupt in China at any time). Therefore, MacArthur cannot leave the Far East, even for a few days. The content of MacArthur's memorandum on the China issue will remain strictly confidential until it is delivered to Washington. However, it is generally expected here that MacArthur will point out the following:</p>
<p>(1) The China problem is primarily a military problem and should be dealt with from this perspective. The United States should emphasize military aid to the Chinese government until the "pro-Soviet Communist movement is suppressed." A certain amount of economic and financial aid is a necessary part of the military plan, but the solution to the military problem needs to be kept in mind at all times. Once the military problem is solved, the Chinese government can restore sovereignty to the areas currently controlled by the Chinese Soviets, and then China can lay the foundation for economic and social development.</p>
<p>(2) The China problem should be observed in relation to the overall situation in Asia. From a geographical and military point of view, China is to Asia as Germany is to Europe.</p>
<p>(3) If the Soviet Union can control all of China, it is clear that Western democracies will find it difficult to prevent Japan, the Philippines, Siam, India, and other countries from suffering the same fate.</p>
<p>(4) The interests of the United States in the Western Pacific and eastern Asia are equal to the interests of the United States in Europe. Japan's conquest of the Northeast provinces and subsequent advance deep into the Chinese mainland was the main cause of the last world war. If the Soviet Union follows the same path</p>
<p>(5) Any consideration of the situation in China is best proven by the fact that the Chinese Communist regime receives its most important inspiration from Moscow and has become a "satellite state of Soviet totalitarianism."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee has received the following three proposals for aid to China: (1) The U.S. government's proposed 15-month emergency goods program of $510 million and a long-term program of $60 million. (2) A three-year industrial revitalization plan proposed by the U.S. with $939 million, stipulating a first-year allocation of $573 million, and an unspecified amount of military aid.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer to Testify as Well</h3>
<p>Lawyer Alman Urges Aid to China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] General Wedemeyer will appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the morning of the 3rd to testify on the issue of aid to China. The committee has not yet received replies from General MacArthur and Chennault, stating whether they will personally return to the United States to present their views on aid to China. 1</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Alman, a former American lawyer in Shanghai, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 2nd, saying: China does not need another aid plan that is merely for relief, but needs a constructive and practical industrial recovery plan, stipulating five items: stabilizing the currency system, revitalizing agriculture and industry, restoring transportation, military aid, and immediate economic assistance. Chinese bankers hope to restore the coin standard. In order to achieve this goal, they need to borrow approximately 600 million ounces of silver from the United States, and banknotes must stop being printed.</p>
<h3>The Committee for Handling Relief Materials Decides to Fund Public Hospitals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Materials held a routine meeting on the 3rd, during which it reviewed various plans proposed by the committee's health, medical, and pharmaceutical committee, which will soon be implemented. The most important plan is to use medical equipment and temporary medical subsidies from American relief materials to subsidize central and municipal hospitals in the seven major cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, as well as government hospitals in the ten provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Chahar, and Rehe, so that these hospitals can provide emergency medical relief to the poor, sick, and refugees. There are also plans to implement prevention and control measures for tuberculosis, cholera, and plague.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 3rd] The Tianjin American Relief Materials Distribution Committee was formally established on the 3rd to prepare for widespread distribution in coordination with the Civil Food Distribution Committee. 5,600 tons of flour from American relief materials have been shipped north in three batches, two of which have already arrived in Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang to Convene the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] Sources say that the Kuomintang will take the opportunity of the Central Committee members coming to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly to convene the Fifth Plenary Session. Regarding the nomination of candidates for President and Vice President, the Kuomintang will also hold a meeting to discuss and decide before the National Assembly convenes.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a routine meeting on the morning of the 3rd, chaired by Zhu Jiahua, and passed the following resolutions: A. The deadline for re-registration of party members, originally the end of February this year, has now been decided to strengthen publicity and extend the deadline to the end of May this year. B. Regarding the downsizing of the Central Party Headquarters, it was resolved to reduce it to one-half of the current number of staff.</p>
<h3>Bullitt Testifies Before the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Strongly Argues for the United States to Face the Crisis in the Far East; Requests Another Special Envoy with Understanding of Political, Economic, and Military Affairs to Come to Our Country</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Bullitt testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 2nd regarding the aid to China bill (the main points of Mr. Bullitt's speech were published in yesterday's newspaper), criticizing the State Department's "blindness and indifference" towards China and strongly advocating the passage of the proposed economic aid to China bill. He said: "The amount of this economic aid, if effectively managed, should be sufficient in purely economic terms. The rules for management should be flexible enough to allow funds originally intended to purchase certain materials to be transferred to purchase other materials when necessary."</p>
<p>He disputed Secretary of State Marshall's testimony regarding the quantity and quality of munitions that the United States has supplied to the Chinese armed forces. He said that Marshall's figures were inaccurate.</p>
<p>Bullitt requested that a "special envoy who understands political and economic affairs and also understands military affairs" be sent to Nanjing. He suggested General MacArthur, the current Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, or General Clark, the former commander of the Allied occupation forces in Austria, as possible candidates.</p>
<p>Bullitt said: "Our nation is in danger. The Soviet Union's strategy for conquering the world is based on the premise that the Soviet Union's strength is not yet sufficient to risk war with the United States, but it must build its domestic war potential and place the resources and people of new strategic areas under its control before attacking us. Therefore, the Soviet Union has strengthened its control over 130 million European people since 1939. Using the actions of the fifth column, it attempts to acquire France and Italy, using the Communist Party as a tool to conquer China by war."</p>
<p>He warned: "If the Soviet Union controls China, it will be able to cast a shadow between the Asian continent and Japan. Not only does Japan depend on the Asian continent for food and raw materials, but also for the majority of its manufactured goods' markets. This will make it impossible for Japan to maintain its economic life unless it prostrates itself under the Iron Curtain and becomes a Soviet satellite state. Communist control of China will lead to Communist control of Japan. China is the throat of the entire Far East."</p>
<p>Bullitt pointed out that the China issue arose from ten years of war, first against Japan and then against the Communist Party. He said: Approximately 80% of the Chinese government's expenditures are used for military purposes. Therefore, the military situation is bound to control the economic and financial situation, because military defeats will lead to total loss. The error in American foreign policy is that it mistakenly recognizes the Soviet Union as a peace-loving country and implies that there is no connection between the Communists and Moscow, believing that most of them are land reformers.</p>
<p>After inquiry, he said that the solution to the China issue will require a long time, but he warned that a situation may arise in the future that will cause the United States to "face a solid Communist front from the Bering Strait to Singapore." He said that the money needed to assist China to prevent this situation is relatively small compared to what is needed in Europe.</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Committee also heard from Alman, who previously worked in China as a diplomat. He said that what China needs is a "positive and realistic recovery plan, not any plan that is merely for relief." He said that this plan should include currency reform, the construction of agriculture and industry, and the restoration of transportation. Like Bullitt, he also advocated providing the Chinese government with military aid and immediate economic assistance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] According to Bullitt's estimates, China can be revived in three years if it is given $450 million in aid each year in addition to military aid.</p>
<p>Representative Jackson suggested that economic stability in China is impossible while the state of war continues. Bullitt agreed with this point. He said that if sufficient military aid is provided, he believes that the entire Chinese Communist Party can be eliminated within three years. He said, "If small arms and munitions could be obtained in early April, Shenyang could be held."</p>
<p>Bullitt said: "I have great respect and admiration for President Chiang. President Chiang should be one of the top ten leaders in the world."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] When Bullitt testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he was asked about the military importance of China avoiding Communist control. Bullitt replied: "I know that there is a vast new industrial area in Siberia, concentrated near Lake Baikal. Bombers can only reach that area if they take off from northwestern China, but if China falls into Stalin's hands, that large industrial area will be free from attack."</p>
<h3>The Four Banks Joint Council Postpones Discussion of This Year's Loan Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] According to related sources: After the Four Banks Joint Council passed the general loan principles for the 37th year (including industrial loans, public transportation business loans, export loans, salt loans, and grain loans), the Four Banks Office submitted them to President Chiang for approval. The implementation methods will have to wait until the Four Banks Joint Council passes them before being submitted to the President again. Furthermore, the Four Banks Joint Council, which was originally scheduled to be held on the 4th, has also been decided to be postponed because the agricultural and industrial loan plans to be discussed have not been completed.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 3rd] The special task force of the Four Banks Office held a review meeting at 3 PM on the 3rd to discuss the issue of grain loans. Xu Baiyuan presided over the meeting. Liu Xingji, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food, Wang Junliang, Director of the Finance Department, Diao Peiran, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, Zhou Mengxin, Director of the Business Office of the Central Agricultural Bank, Ma Keqiang, Manager of the Bank of China, Zhu Tongjiu of the Bank of Communications, and representatives of the Ministry of Finance, totaling more than ten people, conducted a broad review of the issue of grain loans. The general opinion was that the goal of grain loans should be to stabilize grain prices, ease grain supply, and increase sales volume. The target of grain loans will focus on grain loans to local governments. Loans to grain merchants will be reduced as much as possible. In the past, grain loan methods included mortgages and escrow methods. Because escrow easily leads to hoarding, the meeting generally advocated the use of mortgage methods. Regarding how grain loans should be allocated to various locations, the general opinion was that grain loans to the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which are implementing rationing, should be less than in other regions. In addition, the entire grain loan policy was reviewed, and opinions were exchanged on the issue of coordination between grain loans and agricultural loans. In principle, it was generally agreed that they should be closely coordinated, and it was advocated that grain loans should be linked to agricultural production increase plans. The review meeting lasted for three and a half hours and ended at 6:30 PM. All opinions will be organized by Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan and submitted to the next Four Banks Joint Council meeting for discussion. It is reported that the Standing Committee, in view of the current fluctuations in grain prices in various locations and the large number of local governments applying for loans to store grain, has specifically proposed this review in advance. After the Four Banks Joint Council passes the loan policy, grain loans can be opened.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu's Yang-Huai Road Fully Open; Zhang Xuezhong Arrives in Baoying, Residents Along the Line Excited; Refugees Fleeing from the Battle of Fushui Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Baoying Office, 3rd] Today, this reporter followed Commander Zhang Xuezhong of the 7th Pacification District to Baoying. Ten thousand people welcomed him with county flags and firecrackers along the road. Although the highway between Yangzhou and Huai'an was damaged by bandits, it was quickly repaired through cooperation between the military and civilians, and it will be completed on the 3rd. Commander Zhang has instructed the Yang-Huai Company to begin full operation of the entire Yang-Huai line. Zhang's arrival in Baoying has greatly excited millions of people along the Yang-Huai line. Zhang has decided to set up a pacification headquarters in the Caodian Cheqiao area east of the canal embankment and has appointed a certain regimental commander Liu to be responsible for the security of the Yang-Huai highway. All the military forces of Huai'an, Baoying, and Gaoyou counties are under the command of Regimental Commander Liu to ensure the safety of travel.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Democratization of Educational Administration</h3>
<p>This year is the year of constitutional governance. To align with the need for constitutionalism, the Ministry of Education's Educational Research Committee sent letters to education scholars across the country, soliciting their opinions on establishing public opinion organs for education at all levels. The Chinese Education Society also resolved at its annual meeting to request the government to universally establish education councils at all levels. If this proposal is adopted by the government, it will undoubtedly become an epoch-making innovation in our country's educational administration.</p>
<p>What is an education council? It is an educational institution suitable for democratic ideals that has been gradually improved in advanced European and American countries over the past century. In the educational administration systems of European and American democratic countries, there are two parallel systems: one is the administrative system, which exercises administrative and examination powers in education, and its main functions are to implement education policies, investigate students, establish schools, certify teachers, provide teaching guidance, prepare budgets, and work reports; the other is the legislative system, which exercises legislative, judicial, and supervisory powers in education, and its main functions are to determine education policies, review education budgets, stipulate education tax rates, manage education funds, approve curriculum standards, select textbooks, appoint education officials at all levels, accept lawsuits from dismissed teachers, and supervise or impeach education officials and principals at all levels. In the administrative system, there are the Ministry of Education at the central level and education departments, bureaus, and sections at the local level; in the legislative system, there are the National Education Council at the central level and provincial, county, township, and village education councils at the local level, whose councilors are all elected by the public from people who can represent the interests of all levels and are enthusiastic about education. In totalitarian countries, there is only an education administrative system without an education legislative system; there are only the Ministry, departments, bureaus, and sections of education, without education councils at all levels. In democratic countries, the education administrative system must be controlled by the education legislative system; the Ministry, departments, and bureaus of education must obey the education councils at all levels. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, our country has never established a legislative body for education, so education administration has always remained at the stage of constructing a system. Education scholars with democratic ideas have long wanted to introduce the education council system of advanced European and American countries to China. More than twenty years ago, the author also suggested in the book "Research on China's New Education Administration System" to universally establish public opinion organs for education at all levels and to stipulate their organization and powers in detail, but at that time, it happened to be the beginning of political tutelage, and this suggestion failed to attract general attention because it was not in line with the times. Now, at the beginning of constitutional governance, the Chinese Education Society has resolved to request the government to universally establish education councils at all levels. Although its future is unpredictable, the author dares to assert that this is the beginning of the democratization of Chinese education administration.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of establishing education councils? The main goal of establishing such an institution is to democratize the education administration system. The so-called democratized education administration system is a system owned, governed, and enjoyed by the public. It is a system that is public-centered, uses public money, is participated in by the public, and is operated to seek the happiness of the public through education. In simple terms, it is a system that allows the public to participate in education administration. The benefits of this system are extremely obvious. First, the establishment of education councils can increase education tax revenue and prevent the misappropriation and waste of education funds. In democratic societies, the tax rate and method of taxation must be agreed upon by the taxpayers. To have the public spend money on education, it is necessary to make the public willing to pay. To make the public willing to pay, it is necessary to increase their interest in education. To increase their interest in education, it is necessary to give them the opportunity to actively participate in education administration. The establishment of education councils is to enable the public to participate in education administration, increase their interest in education, and be willing to spend more money on education. Furthermore, since education funds are managed by the education councils, ordinary administrative officials do not dare to misappropriate them, education administration leaders do not dare to engage in corruption, and the efficiency of education administration can also be improved as a result. Second, the establishment of education councils can prevent factional struggles and protect the careers and freedom of teachers. In authoritarian societies, education officials are responsible to their superiors. As long as they gain the trust of their superiors, their positions are as stable as Mount Tai, and they can form cliques, engage in private interests, and monopolize education. At the same time, the careers of education workers without factional backgrounds are not guaranteed at all. In democratic societies, education officials must be responsible to the public and must have the support of the education councils. Once they lose their credibility, they will be impeached and dismissed, so they cannot monopolize education unless they can monopolize the education councils, which is extremely difficult. At the same time, education workers who are forced to leave their jobs due to discrimination can appeal to the education councils. If they win the lawsuit, they can still return to their original positions, and their career and freedom of speech can be adequately protected. Fourth, the establishment of education councils can ensure that the education provided is for the welfare of the public. In the old society, national education only represented the special interests of a few aristocrats, landlords, warlords, and bureaucrats, because the public had no say in the determination of education policies, the compilation of curriculum standards, and the content of moral cultivation. In democratic societies, the authority of the public in education administration is higher than everything else. Education councils can decide education policies, review textbooks, and determine the content and methods of cultivation, so the interests of farmers, workers, and other classes are guaranteed in education policies and content. Public welfare becomes the touchstone of education values. Anything that can withstand the test of this touchstone can exist, otherwise it will be eliminated. Education participated in by the public can truly seek the welfare of the public and truly eliminate the feudal vestiges in education.</p>
<p>Can the establishment of education councils suit our country's historical traditions? Although education councils are an institution of advanced European and American democratic countries, there is no difficulty in transplanting them to China, because local education in our country has a long democratic tradition. Without mentioning the distant past, even the community schools and academies of the Ming and Qing dynasties had so-called executive committees, whose executives were publicly recommended by local gentry, and whose powers were similar to those of European and American education councils, such as raising school land and grain, repairing school buildings, managing school property, and hiring teachers or rectors. In villages where clans lived together, each ancestral hall had an executive organization composed of executives publicly recommended by clan members, and part of its powers was to manage ancestral land, establish private schools, hire teachers, and encourage young people in the clan to take exams. This is also a prototype of democratic education organizations participated in by the people. These excellent democratic traditions may have a history of more than a thousand years in our country's villages. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the education funds of Henan Province and Anhui Province were once independent, and education fund management committees were established, and their achievements were very remarkable, and their powers were very similar to those of the state education committees in the United States. As for the democratic education organizations in the countryside, the system implemented in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, can be cited as an example. Each village in the county has an "Education Society," whose cadres are publicly recommended by clan members, and whose powers are to raise school land and grain, repair school buildings, manage school property, hire teachers, and issue scholarships. Not only is admission to school free for children in the village, but each person can also receive two to five piculs of grain per year. Students in the village who are admitted to middle school can receive six to ten piculs of grain per year, and those who are admitted to university can receive twenty to thirty piculs of grain per year. Students who repeat a grade will not receive grain that year, and they will not receive grain after graduation. The organization of the Education Society is very common in the county, so the number of acres of school land accounts for one-tenth of the cultivated land in the county, and compulsory education has generally been popularized. It is heard that similar Education Societies are also organized in various counties in Hunan, so vocational schools are also very developed. Based on the above facts, we can imagine that the establishment of education councils is not to force the Western education system into China's social organization, but to inherit the excellent traditions of community schools and academies for more than a thousand years, synthesize the results of experiments in various places since the establishment of the Republic of China, and refer to the experience of advanced European and American countries to establish a more enriched and expanded education system. It has continuity with our country's historical traditions.</p>
<p>In summary, the establishment of education councils not only utilizes the valuable experience of advanced European and American countries, but also inherits our country's excellent traditions. If this system is properly implemented, it will definitely increase education tax revenue, improve administrative efficiency, prevent factional monopoly, protect education freedom, develop public welfare, and realize the education ideal of being owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Improving the Finances of the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The full text of the Northeast Petition Delegation's suggestions to the Executive Yuan and relevant agencies regarding financial and monetary improvement is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Current State of Finance and Currency in the Northeast. After the recovered areas of the Northeast successively fell, transportation was obstructed, materials were scarce, remittance was blocked, the currency was stifled, and as a result, prices rose, capital was insufficient, and turnover was ineffective. Currently, the Shenyang branch of the Central Bank has about 300 billion in outstanding payments. The Shenyang area needs to urgently purchase 210,000 bags of military grain for February, March, and April of this year, requiring about 160 billion yuan. The monthly expenditure of various military and institutional agencies is 300 billion yuan. When this representative came to Nanjing (February 25), there was an urgent need for 660 billion yuan in banknotes, but the branch only had 20 billion yuan in banknotes, a huge disparity between supply and demand. As a result, the following adverse consequences have occurred, greatly affecting the suppression of bandits: 1. Grain payments cannot be made, affecting the purchase of military grain; 2. Military grain cannot be distributed, affecting the morale of soldiers; 3. Salaries of public officials and all employees cannot be paid, affecting administrative and production efficiency. In addition to finding ways to allocate funds immediately to alleviate the urgent need, the government should at this time give serious reconsideration to the issuance of circulating notes. According to the information available to this delegation when it came to Nanjing, the national army can only control 48 townships (possibly even fewer now). It is unbearable for the people of 48 townships to bear all the military and administrative expenses. Even if the military is not defeated, the economy will inevitably collapse. Therefore, solving the problem of this circulating note is a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>(2) Specific Remedial Measures: 1. Open remittance to absorb currency and allow it to flow back, so that each area can share the burden equally. Since the expansion of the rebellion by the treacherous bandits, the recovered areas only have over 40 townships, with a population of less than several million, making it unreasonable and impossible for them to bear all the expenses of suppressing the bandits. The suppression of bandits should be borne by all the people, and the Northeast should not be an exception. Furthermore, considering the current prices in Shenyang, which are three times higher than those in Beiping and Tianjin, and five times higher than those in Nanjing and Shanghai, it is actually due to the imbalance between the supply of materials and currency. If remittance is opened, prices in various places will not differ so greatly. Currently, prices in the Northeast are much higher than those in various places within the customs, actually due to the different monetary systems and remittance controls. Therefore, in order to save the economic collapse of the Northeast and affect the military suppression of bandits, the central government should immediately fully open remittance between various places inside and outside the customs, so that funds can flow into various places and balance the burden. 2. Stop issuing circulating notes so that existing circulating notes can be used interchangeably with legal tender and customs gold at a fixed value. When the Northeast was recovered, considering the special financial and economic situation in the Northeast, in order to adapt to the local situation, seek the stability of the people's lives, and stabilize prices, the Central Bank was specially allowed to issue circulating notes for the nine provinces of the Northeast. This was originally a temporary expedient measure. At the beginning of the recovery, it had a stabilizing effect on local finance. Now that times have changed, the Northeast has successively fallen, the people are impoverished, prices have risen, military demand is huge, currency is rampant, and the economy is out of balance. The central government should immediately stipulate a fixed ratio between legal tender and circulating notes, stop issuing them, allow free remittance, so that legal tender and circulating notes can be used in circulation inside and outside the customs, and stabilize finance, which will greatly benefit the suppression of bandits.</p>
<h3>China Social Research Association Discusses Our Political and Economic Path</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) (6) A democratic system must be based on the application of party organization. There should be parallel political parties in the country, criticizing and supervising each other, and each striving to win the support of public opinion. Political parties must not use any pretext to use violence to suppress dissidents. The final expression of public opinion is the transfer of elected power, which should be determined by the results of the election; (7) Elections should be based on districts, and the representatives elected by the people are responsible for exercising power; (8) The basic principles of local autonomy should be guaranteed by the Constitution. For matters of local autonomy, the central government can only exercise supervisory power within the scope prescribed by law; (9) Democratic politics should not only focus on form, but also pay attention to the practical benefits that the administration brings to the public. The democratic politics we want should guarantee the basic freedoms and rights of the people, ensuring freedom from fear, deprivation, oppression, and exploitation.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Answers Questions from Reporters</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Song replied to reporters' inquiries, saying: (1) Rice smuggling exports used to be 4,000 dan per day, but now it is only 1,000 dan. Strict prohibition has already been implemented. If anyone is arrested, no matter who they are or what power they have, they will be sent to the Northeast. (2) The suppression of bandits has now adopted an offensive strategy. The security in the Dongjiang and Hanjiang rivers is relatively poor, and large troops have been dispatched to suppress them. The strength of the large bandit forces can be completely eliminated in a few months. (3) Construction of Huangpu Port will begin this year. Zhang Jia'ao is very interested in this and has decided to complete it in phases. (4) The strict management system is causing a large amount of overseas remittances to escape to Hong Kong. Methods are being devised to prevent this, and it will not be difficult to restore overseas remittances. (5) The grain shortage in Shantou is serious, and efforts are being made to find solutions. In addition to the 30 tons allocated by the Social Affairs Department to Shantou, logical rice transported there can also be used for relief. Currently, Fujian Province has agreed to allow Guangdong to purchase 7,000 dan, and discussions are also underway with Taiwan for 3,000 dan. (6) The Hainan Island steel plant is also being actively pursued. He hopes to complete this matter during his tenure. (7) Although the Northeast problem is serious, he believes that the government can cope with it. With the spirit of resistance, all difficulties can be solved. (8) Investment in local industries in the province, as long as it is beneficial to the people's livelihood and economy, is welcome regardless of Chinese or foreign investors, but speculative and investment businesses are absolutely not welcome. Finally, regarding rumors that he will go to the Executive Yuan and the United States, he said that he is very willing to serve his hometown and that the above news is unfounded.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 3rd] Song Ziwen told reporters that after the realization of the 60 million US dollar US aid for improving the Yuehan Railway, in addition to improving the railway tracks and carriages, the Yuegan Railway from Shaoguan to Ji'an will also be built.

He also believes that this matter will definitely succeed.</p>

<h3>Vice Chairman Points Out Soviet Breach of Contract; Zeng Qi Expresses Deep Agreement; Sharpening the People's Hearts and Awakening the National Spirit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Zeng Qi, a leader of the Youth Party, recently expressed his praise for the speech made by Vice Chairman Sun Ke in Taiwan on the 1st. Zeng stated: In his speech in Taipei on the 1st, Vice Chairman Sun Ke discussed Sino-Soviet relations, pointing out three ways in which the Soviet Union had wronged China: (1) failing to withdraw troops as agreed and removing industrial equipment; (2) failing to return Lushun and Dalian; (3) supplying the Chinese Communists with Japanese weaponry. His words were stern and righteous, and his attitude was clear. Zeng also said: The recent speeches by Mr. Sun Zhesheng (Sun Ke) and Mr. Hu Shi on the Soviet Union were extremely clear and forthright, truly sufficient to clarify "right and wrong" and set the "trend," sharpen "people's hearts" and awaken the "national spirit," which is deeply admirable. The year before last, in the autumn, I ventured out of customs despite illness to inspect the "Northeast after the Restoration." I personally visited Changchun, the scholarly community, and Shenyang, witnessing firsthand the reality of the Soviet Union removing industrial equipment and the remnants of destruction by the Communist bandits. I could not help but feel distressed and heartbroken, filled with grief and indignation. Taking the Shenyang Arsenal as an example, what I saw was: (1) The Fengtian Factory (operated by Zhang Zuolin and Yang Yuting), with a site of six square li, suffered losses of about 70% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. (2) The Manchurian Powder Factory (established by the Japanese), with a site of over 5,000 mu, suffered losses of about 40% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. (3) The Japanese 383 Unit Arsenal, with a site of over 16,000 mu, suffered losses of about 50% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. (4) The Japanese 918 Unit Arsenal, with a site of over 3,000 mu, suffered losses of about 48% due to Soviet removal and Communist bandit destruction. Furthermore, the relocation and destruction of light and heavy industry were countless. I advocate that our government should publicize the facts to the world to seek a fair judgment from world public opinion. Unexpectedly, it has been delayed until now without implementation. Although the authorities' caution reflects painstaking efforts, the significant losses of the nation must ultimately be compensated. Vice Chairman Sun clearly pointed out the three points of Soviet breach of contract, with which I deeply agree.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The U.S. Embassy announced today: The embassy "still has no comment" on the remarks made by Vice Chairman Sun Ke of the Chinese government regarding the Taiwan issue, but may issue a formal statement in the future.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi's Statement</h3>
<p>Regarding His Life During His Time as Envoy to the Soviet Union: An Editorial in a Certain Newspaper in the Capital Is Completely Groundless</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Mr. Shao Lizi read a certain newspaper in the capital yesterday, where the editorial stated, "Before the war, when Shao Lizi was the ambassador to Moscow, his entire salary was only enough to support his life, and it was not even satisfactory. Other staff members of the embassy suffered even more." He made the following statement: "First, I have never been concerned about my personal life, so I have never complained about my life not being satisfactory, not only during my time in Moscow. Second, my observations during my time in Moscow were compiled into the book 'Returning from the Soviet Union' after returning to the country, which can be reviewed. Third, during my tenure as ambassador to the Soviet Union, I returned over US$20,000 of surplus public funds from the embassy to the national treasury in three installments, which can also prove my living conditions during my time as ambassador. In short, the claims made by the newspaper, I do not know where they heard it from, but I have absolutely never made similar remarks."</p>

Yu replied that he would discuss the Nanchang food supply with Wang Lingji and Nanchang Mayor Tang Xin and would not allow a food shortage to occur in Nanchang. However, last year, the provincial government allocated grain to stabilize prices during the lean season, which helped to overcome the famine season. Now, due to the urgent need for military grain, the provincial government has no surplus grain to stabilize prices. The China Grain Corporation originally planned to purchase 30,000 large packages of grain in Jiangxi and has already purchased 7,000 shi. The City Council has decided to ask the provincial government to stop the China Grain Corporation from purchasing rice for export. Yu has now agreed not to purchase any more in Jiangxi, but hopes that the 7,000 shi already purchased by the China Grain Corporation can be transported to Shanghai to regulate the food supply. Yu and others are scheduled to go to Xunyang and Wuhan on the 4th.</p>

The remainder will be purchased at market prices from provincial and county-level public grain, and Fengcheng and 33 other counties will be designated as purchasing counties. The 17 counties and cities with the most grain production will be designated as mobile purchasing locations. However, Yu, due to the urgent need for military grain, requested the province to transport it all within three months, but the issues of concentration and transportation still need to be further discussed to improve methods. No results were achieved by late evening. Zhang Daomin, director of the Land Tax Department who came to Jiangxi with Yu, was still in discussions with the Ministry of Grain's personnel stationed in Jiangxi and the provincial government late into the evening.</p>

<h3>The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Releases A Summary of the War Situation for the Week; The National Army Fully Controls the Shenyang-Xinmin Front</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a summary of the war situation for the week from February 25th to March 2nd on the 3rd. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Northeast: The focus of the war situation this week is still in the Northeast. In order to isolate Pan Yang, the bandits tried their best to cut off the Beining Road and control southern Liaoning. Because of the successful raid on Yingkou, the bandits in western Liaoning, in order to echo southern Liaoning, also concentrated the forces of four columns to attack Xinmin. On the one hand, they also transferred three columns to attack Kaiyuan, still wanting to threaten Siping. The purpose was nothing more than to take advantage of the fact that the Northeast had not yet thawed to consolidate the defense of the port in southern Liaoning and open up a land supply line from northern Manchuria to the south in order to prevent the National Army from launching a full-scale offensive after the spring thaw. Therefore, they did not hesitate to make significant sacrifices, concentrating artillery fire for fierce bombardment, and using human wave tactics and close combat.</p>
<p>After this all-out offensive, except for southern Liaoning and Kaiyuan, which the bandits were able to opportunistically invade and occupy due to the weak forces of the National Army and the difficulty in sending reinforcements, the bandits suffered heavy losses on the Xinmin and Juliuhe line. The various nearby columns are retreating to northern Liaoning. The front lines of Xinmin and Pan Yang are still completely controlled by the heroic soldiers of the National Army.</p>
<p>North China: In North China, the National Army launched sweeping operations this week. On the 28th, it recovered Yongqing County in the Pingjinbao triangular area and defeated more than 1,000 bandits from the Bohai Military District east of Duliu, recovering important strongholds such as Laojuntang and Chuanjiawo. At the same time, the National Army in Nankou also completely eliminated the bandit work group in the Re-Cha-Ji border area in the Thirteen Tombs area, and captured more than 30 bandits, including the bandit commander Gao Zhe. They are still continuing to pursue the main bandit force for suppression.</p>
<p>Central China: Chen Yi's bandit troops in Central China, after being chased by the National Army from eastern Henan, had to adopt a method of fleeing in separate groups. The exhausted bandit army is always trying to avoid engaging our side. In the past few days, its First Column fled south across the road from the old Kao City and suffered heavy blows, with more than 3,000 casualties. The main force of the Third Column and the Eighth Column fled from the area east of Yancheng on the Pinghan Line to the area between Yuxian and Xiangcheng west of the road. The Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Columns are fleeing in the triangular area between Zhecheng, Taikang, and Huaiyang. As for the Fourth Column, which is isolated in western Shandong, in addition to the Liangguang Column avoiding battle to reorganize, it is still trying to maintain Chen Yi's rear supply line. In order to strike at the main force of the bandit army, the National Army is currently searching and suppressing them in separate routes.</p>
<p>Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Dabie Mountain area are now approaching their final days and have become a battlefield remnant. His Third and Sixth Columns, after repeated attacks by the National Army, are still fleeing in the mountainous areas near Luoshan, Jingfu, Macheng, and Yingshan. The Second Column also appears to be fleeing north again from Xixian via Wunengji. The First Column is still in the area south of Renqiu. In order to clean up this remnant, the National Army is stepping up its suppression separately. The bandits in the mountainous area are weakening day by day.</p>
<p>Shanxi-Shaanxi: In Shanxi-Shaanxi, Peng Dehuai led the main force of his First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns and began to invade Yichuan on the 24th of last month. The National Army stationed there gave them a head-on blow. In one night, the bandits suffered more than 6,400 casualties. On the 29th, the bandit leader He Long led another five brigades to cross the river from western Shanxi to reinforce them. The National Army fought bravely, with one against ten, and although there were also casualties, they are still in stalemate. Peng's purpose is nothing more than to contain the National Army's eastward encirclement and suppression of Chen Geng's bandit troops, and to isolate Yan'an or flee back to Yan'an's old base, but this dream will not be easily realized.</p>
<h3>Impeding the Westward Expansion of Communist Forces: The U.S. Urgently Needs to Provide Aid to Turkey and Greece; Marshall Appeals to the House Foreign Affairs Committee; U.S. Lawmakers Advocate Establishing a New International Organization to Safeguard Collective Security</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 3rd (Broadcast): Washington dispatch, Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, stating that the pressure from the Communist Party on Turkey and Greece is intensifying. If these countries are to maintain their freedom, they must receive aid from the United States. Both strongly urged Congress to approve an additional $275 million in military aid to Turkey and Greece. Marshall believes this aid can strengthen the Greek government's fight against guerrillas. Forrestal believes that aiding Turkey and Greece is a test of America's determination to resist communist aggression and said that only the U.S. can help Turkey and Greece maintain their freedom and remain among democratic nations. If we hesitate, America's leadership in rebuilding the world and the prospects for peace will suffer greatly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Several Republican senators today submitted an amendment to the Marshall Plan to the Senate, advocating that the United States lead other nations in establishing a supreme international commission outside the United Nations to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence. The proposal was decided upon at a meeting of 14 Republicans last night to discuss amending the Marshall Plan. Although the full text does not directly mention the Soviet Union, the intention is clear. According to the proposal, the right of veto cannot be used in the future new world organization, and its main task is to prevent "aggression or sabotage in any form." According to Senator Brewster, who participated in last night's meeting, the new organization is a "defensive alliance" that will provide "effective collective security" without being undermined by the veto power.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] Republican senators criticized the government's export policy, accusing the government of shipping rare materials needed for the European Recovery Program to the Soviet Union. Senators Knowland and Vandenberg demanded that the government explain why it was sending industrial materials to the Soviet Union while simultaneously requesting billions of dollars from Congress to prevent communism in Europe. Acting Secretary of Commerce Foster denied in a letter to Knowland that rare materials were being shipped to the Soviet Union. He stated that the total value of goods shipped to the Soviet Union in 1947 reached $149,129,000, including only trains, vehicles, electrical machinery, electric machine tools, mining machines, etc., and there were absolutely no items that directly assisted the war effort.</p>

At that time, hundreds of people were arrested, political parties and trade unions were dissolved, and four publishing houses were shut down. The defendants' protest against the secret trial was ineffective. According to the prosecutor, the public has become indignant towards the Communist Party, and for safety reasons, a secret trial is absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Agrees to Direct Consultation Among the Five Powers to Resolve the Holy Land Partition Plan; Britain Declares Refusal to Participate in Cooperation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] Soviet representative Gromyko stated at the United Nations Security Council today that he conditionally accepted the American suggestion that the five major powers jointly find a way to resolve the Palestine problem. Gromyko declared that the Soviet Union opposes the formal establishment of a five-power committee to consult with the Arab, Jewish, and British parties. This matter must be consulted by the five major powers themselves. Setting up another committee would only delay the solution, and no major power should hide behind the committee. The American proposal to establish a five-power committee to consult with the parties involved is far-fetched and cannot be considered proper. There is already a Palestine committee consulting with the Jewish and Arab parties, and there is no need to add redundant institutions. After holding informal meetings, the five major powers should report to the Security Council within ten or fifteen days. The situation is urgent and cannot be delayed any longer. In addition, Gromyko has not yet expressed his attitude regarding the Palestine Committee's request to send international troops to assist in the implementation of the Holy Land partition, and representatives of other countries have also delayed speaking on this point. Earlier, American representative Austin spoke, urging the adoption of his proposal made a week ago and saying that the United States supports the Palestine partition plan passed by the United Nations General Assembly, but it must be implemented peacefully. As Austin was about to finish his speech and asked the Security Council to take action, a woman in the public gallery suddenly shouted, "What kind of action?" Guards immediately stopped the woman from shouting, but the woman continued to mutter. The guards then dragged her out of the venue. While resisting, the woman shouted, "Don't Americans have the right to speak?" Other guards gathered and finally carried her out.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] British Colonial Secretary Jones told the Security Council yesterday that Britain would refuse to participate in the five-power committee proposed by the United States to find a way to resolve the deadlock in the United Nations' implementation of the partition plan. He also stated that the British military presence in Palestine will not be extended beyond August 1.</p>
<h3>United Nations Personnel Arrive in Jerusalem</h3>

<h3>Carelessness at a Chinese School in the Philippines</h3>

<h3>Boehner Elected Prime Minister of British-American Zone in Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 2nd] The Economic Council of the British-American zone today elected Boehner as chairman with 40 votes against 8, and 48 abstentions. Communist members protested that Boehner had not obtained a majority of the attending members and proposed a "vote of no confidence." However, since a vote of no confidence can only be proposed after the Land Council of the merged zone and the British-American control authorities approve the chairman's appointment, the Communist members' attempt to oppose was temporarily unsuccessful. The chairman of the Economic Council is equivalent to the "Prime Minister" of the merged zone. In addition, Erhard of the Christian Social Union party in Bavaria was elected as the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Economic Council, and others elected were Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Forestry Huhnigen, Minister of Finance Hartmann, Minister of Transportation Fromme, and Minister of Post and Telecommunications Huber. Observers expect the new "Prime Minister" to gain the support of the Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party, but will face opposition from the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>Finland at a Crossroads: President Inquires of Stalin with Seven Questions; All Political Parties Agree to Tentative Negotiations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 3rd] It is now confirmed that President Paasikivi is becoming impatient with the Parliament's delay in expressing its opinion on the issue of the Soviet Union's request for a treaty. Although the leaders of all parties agree to conduct treaty negotiations, they emphasize that they do not have to accept Stalin's proposal as a result. Based on his many years of experience in dealing with the Soviet Union, Paasikivi fears that the parliament's delay will anger the Soviet Union and undermine the basis for favorable negotiations. The chairman of the party group declared that [they] have no intention of using delaying tactics, but the issue is very serious and must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 2nd] It was announced here today that Finnish President Paasikivi has raised seven questions to Stalin regarding the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a military mutual assistance treaty with Finland. These include: (1) What obligations will the treaty stipulate for the Finnish army, which has already been greatly reduced due to the peace treaty? (2) What impact will the treaty have on public opinion? (3) Will the treaty improve or harm relations between the two countries? (4) What impact will the treaty have on the peace treaty? (5) What is the meaning of certain provisions in the Romanian and Bulgarian treaties? Stalin had specifically mentioned the Romanian and Bulgarian treaties as models for a mutual assistance treaty with Finland. These questions have been included in a letter that the Finnish president entrusted to Soviet envoy Savonenkov last Saturday to be forwarded to Stalin. Government experts have already prepared a report after studying the issue, but the parties, except for the far-left party that supports the Soviet-Finnish treaty, are still studying it. All party leaders except the leader of the People's Democratic League say that Finland does not welcome the conclusion of a military mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, but cannot refuse to discuss it. While these leaders advocate maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union, they also believe that Finland should ideally take a neutral stance. They also advocate that whether or not to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union should be decided by the Parliament. It is said that President Paasikivi also agrees that the decision should be made by the Parliament rather than the United Cabinet. The People's Democratic League occupies a very important position in the cabinet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 2nd] The parliamentarians of the Social Democratic Party, one of Finland's three major parties, met tonight to discuss the Soviet Union's request for Finland to conclude a mutual assistance and friendship treaty and issued a statement requesting that this issue be handled in accordance with constitutional and democratic methods, and denouncing the Communist Party's attempt to provoke and create domestic conflict and discord among the classes by using the past situation. Earlier, the Communist Party had begun to propagate support for the Soviet Union's request. The People's Democratic League controlled by the Communist Party occupies 51 of the 200 seats in the parliament and is the largest party in the country. Other government groups such as the Social Democratic Party and the Farmers' Party each occupy 48 seats.</p>
<p>However, the "People's Front" and the extreme left wing of the Social Democratic Party also issued a statement late at night, urging acceptance of the military treaty and praising the Soviet Union as "the most powerful country on our continent." The leaders of the six major parties each held meetings, warning party members that Finland had little choice but to begin negotiations on a military treaty. However, the party leaders reiterated that accepting negotiations does not mean accepting the treaty.</p>
<h3>Italian Deputy Foreign Minister's Important Documents Stolen Due to Momentary Negligence</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 3rd] A briefcase containing important official documents belonging to Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Brusca was stolen on the 3rd. The briefcase was lost on his car due to a momentary negligence, and then stolen when the driver left the car unattended.

<h3>Small General Assembly Establishes Fifteen-Nation Group</h3>
<p>To Study Ways to Mediate International Disputes</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 2nd] The United Nations Small General Assembly today unanimously passed the joint Sino-American proposal to establish a fifteen-nation ad hoc committee to study ways to enhance international cooperation to maintain peace in accordance with the United Nations Charter. This joint proposal has a far-reaching impact on the future of the United Nations. The ad hoc committee will study various proposals, the main purpose of which is to seek solutions to international disputes by conciliation and mediation mechanisms before they are submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly. If this goal is successful, the United Nations can avoid certain political disputes. The ad hoc committee is composed of fifteen countries, including Britain, the United States, China, France, Belgium, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Greece, Iran, Lebanon, Sweden, and Venezuela. Its research results will be submitted to the Small General Assembly in a preliminary report within three weeks.</p>
<h3>British Government to Use Remaining $100 Million of U.S. Loan Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] A responsible person said today that the last remaining $100 million of the U.S. loan to Britain may be used within two or three days. The Ministry of Finance neither confirmed nor denied this. Of the $3.75 billion in U.S. loans, $400 million remained unused by August 20 last year, which was once frozen and then unfrozen, with $100 million being withdrawn monthly.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia Implements Strict Purge: Hundreds of Thousands Unemployed or Demoted; Beneš's Heartbreak and Suicide Rumors Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 2nd] Unofficial estimates put the number of people unemployed or demoted in the Czech purge at hundreds of thousands. In one iron factory in Moravia, 1,100 workers were dismissed simply because they refused to sign a declaration of loyalty to the new government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Hamburg Radio reported that according to a spokesman for the Czech Ministry of Information, President Beneš suddenly fell ill at a villa outside Prague and is being treated by his personal physician. It is uncertain when he will return to office.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] Rumors are rampant here that Czech President Beneš has committed suicide. French officials refused to comment on this. The Czech Embassy in Paris has officially denied the rumor. However, authoritative French sources assert that Beneš attempted suicide unsuccessfully but has become seriously ill as a result. It is said that Beneš committed suicide by taking poison at a villa outside Prague. The report did not disclose other details, but only hinted that the Action Committee's guards discovered it and prevented the poison from taking full effect. Earlier, it was rumored in London and Paris that Beneš had resigned, but the Czech Embassy in London quickly denied the rumor.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Prague, 2nd] Czech President Beneš, who had dedicated 34 years of his life to fighting for the independence of his country, having been exiled twice, is reportedly considering one of three strategies to protest the Communist seizure of power. A senior official in close contact with Beneš said, "The President is currently considering the following three strategies: (1) Resigning and leaving the country. This move is quite risky, as he is old and may not be able to withstand it, and a third exile is not something he would willingly do. He knows that there are successors coveting his position, and they could launch a propaganda war at any time, tarnishing his reputation. (2) Resigning but remaining in the country. (3) Continuing to serve until the end of his term in 1953 and continuing to perform his duties. He only accepted the new regime under pressure and in violation of his ideas of constitutional representative procedures, so Beneš will not openly support it." The official said that Beneš is seriously considering the third strategy, "Continuing to serve may be a spiritual boost for the Czech people."</p>
<h3>Czech Ambassador to the U.S. and Canadian Minister Have Resigned Voluntarily</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 3rd (Broadcast): Washington dispatch, Czech Ambassador to the United States Slavík has recently resigned to protest the recent coup d'état launched by the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia. He said that President Beneš had to accept the Communist cabinet under strong pressure from the Communist Party. Under these circumstances, he could not continue to serve as ambassador. Also, Czech Minister to Canada Neimanek has also resigned.</p>

<p>Hidden Pains Before the Birth of a World Organization</p>
<p>On August 28, 1944, during the second week of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the Soviet representative, Gromyko, suddenly introduced a new and surprising proposal in the discussions.</p>
<p>The discussions in the Steering Committee of the conference were focused on which countries should be the original members of the United Nations organization. Both the Soviet Union and we believed that member states should be the United Nations and associated nations. However, a fundamental difference arose in the interpretation of this matter.</p>
<p>Our intention was that the member states should be all countries that had signed the United Nations Declaration, plus eight countries that, although not at war with the Axis powers, had materially helped the Allied nations during the war. In fact, their contributions were even greater than some of the Allied countries themselves. These eight countries were six Latin American nations, plus Iceland and Egypt. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, stated that the member states should be the original twenty-six countries that had signed the United Nations Declaration, and their interpretation of "associated nations" referred only to countries that signed the Declaration later. They were unwilling to include the eight countries we had mentioned. Regarding the latter point, our discussions were fruitless. In fact, it remained unresolved by the end of the conference. At the same time, Ambassador Gromyko, without any prior notice, suddenly proposed to the Steering Committee that all sixteen republics that made up the Soviet Union should be original members of the United Nations organization. Thus, the Soviet Union would have sixteen votes. This proposal stunned Stettinius and Cadogan (head of the British delegation) and they did not know how to respond. But they immediately told him that his proposal would cause great difficulties. When Stettinius reported the matter to the President, the President firmly stated that the United States could not accept this proposal under any circumstances. He told Stettinius to explain to Gromyko that this matter would cause endless trouble, and if it were agreed to allow the sixteen states comprising the Soviet Union to join, then we could just as logically demand that the forty-eight states of the American Union join individually.</p>
<p>When Stettinius reported this matter to me, I said that I was extremely surprised by this proposal. I also said that none of us Americans involved in postwar planning had ever considered this issue. I concluded that I would oppose it with all my strength.</p>
<p>On August 29, Stettinius informed Gromyko of the results of his conversations with the President and me, saying that we considered this proposal to be outside the agenda, and if it was insisted upon at this time, it would hinder the success of the conference. Stettinius asked Gromyko to withdraw the proposal, and said that if the Soviet government had such an intention, it would be more appropriate to raise it in the Security Council after the United Nations organization was established.</p>
<p>Gromyko was very cooperative. He said that his raising this point was merely to inform us and the British that his government had such an idea in mind. He agreed not to mention the matter again during the conference. However, he hinted that the Soviet government might raise this issue again at other times.</p>
<p>The fact that the Soviet government had such an idea about multiple member states was quite troubling. I then asked Ambassador Gromyko to see me on August 31. During the meeting, I frankly told him the reasons for my opposition to the issue raised by him on behalf of his government. I told him that his proposal would "blow everything up." I said that since the major powers would occupy a leading position in the organization and contribute military force, they would have no difficulty in making their views known to other countries, whether they had one vote or many votes. The United States did not want more than one vote, but we felt that, due to our strength, we would be able to express our opinions clearly at any time.</p>
<p>On the same day, we prepared a telegram at the State Department for the President to send to Stalin on this matter. The President approved it, but added a sentence saying that our position did not affect future discussions on this issue after the establishment of the United Nations organization, at which time the organization would have full authority to deal with the matter. This issue of the Soviet Union wanting multiple votes was mentioned once more by Gromyko near the end of the conference. Afterwards, until my resignation in November 1944, I never heard it mentioned again. The Soviet representatives also never mentioned to me their later request to allow Belarus and Ukraine to join, which President Roosevelt agreed to at the Yalta Conference. If they had raised it with me earlier, I would definitely have opposed it.</p>
<p>Throughout all discussions at the conference, we strove to keep this proposal strictly secret. Even in our own memoranda, we only referred to it as "something." I felt that this matter was so explosive that if it were leaked, it would definitely be exploited by opposing forces everywhere to undermine the position of the Soviet Union and the entire conference.</p>
<p>On September 6, Stettinius and I met with the President at the White House to discuss the major issues under discussion at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. President Roosevelt first mentioned the location of the new organization's headquarters. He believed that the various institutions of the organization should hold meetings around the world.</p>
<p>He felt that the secretariat of the new organization could be located in Geneva, but that the meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council should not be held there. He believed that the General Assembly should hold meetings in a different location each year, and that the Security Council would need two fixed meeting locations, one in the Azores in the mid-Atlantic and one on an island in the Hawaiian Islands in the mid-Pacific. He felt that the International Court of Justice should return to The Hague.</p>
<p>The President was very serious when expressing these views, and he also said that he was prepared to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Churchill when he went to Quebec for the Second Quebec Conference later that month. The State Department prepared maps and memoranda regarding the Azores and the island of Niihau in Hawaii, and the President planned to take them to Quebec.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt had put a lot of thought into the issue of the United Nations headquarters, and this was not the first time he had told me about his views on this matter. He felt that putting the Security Council in the Azores or the Hawaiian Islands would have the benefit of keeping it at a distance from the world. The President was by nature a naval person, and he liked to look at the world from isolated islands in the sea. In the late 1930s, he had tried hard to hold a meeting of the heads of state on warships or on islands, such as the Azores. He felt that if the Security Council was far out at sea, it would not be subject to pressure from any country. He recalled the Paris Peace Conference, and the pressure that resulted from holding the conference in the capital of a major power. He felt that the League of Nations had been subject to pressure when it was located in London before moving to Geneva.</p>
<p>He said that in nature, he hoped to establish something like an international District of Columbia. (I often found that when the President described his views on international issues, he liked to use the situation in the United States itself as a comparison. The most obvious example was in his speeches in 1940 and 1941, when he compared the ease with which Axis planes could fly from Dakar to Brazil to the ease with which they could fly from one city to another in the United States.)</p>
<p>However, scattering an international organization in different locations around the world was not a very logical thing to do, so we never seriously insisted on these ideas at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. In any case, this was not a matter that the four powers could decide, but rather one that should be decided by all the member states of the future organization.</p>
<p>We also discussed with the President the Soviet proposal to establish an international air force under the United Nations organization, to be commanded by the Security Council. Stettinius and I explained the position of the American delegation, saying that we should oppose the establishment of an international air force, and instead propose that each country form its own air force squadron, which could be deployed to mixed airfields upon notification to carry out missions. This proposal was consistent with the President's statement on June 15 that he did not intend to establish an international police force. The President agreed that we should insist on this position. Stettinius told the President that Prime Minister Churchill might mention this issue to him in Quebec, because we had heard that Prime Minister Churchill seemed to be quite impressed with the Soviet proposal.</p>
<p>We also discussed another Soviet proposal, namely that small countries that could not contribute air force to the security organization should contribute land as bases. The President and I both strongly opposed this provision, as it infringed on the sovereignty of small countries. We felt that such actions should be entirely voluntary, and small countries should not be forced to contribute bases. However, the Soviet view was given considerable recognition in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference proposals, which advocated special agreements providing "facilities," armed forces, and other assistance to be at the disposal of the Security Council.</p>
<p>At that time, when we mentioned this new international organization, we often referred to it as the "United Nations." We had been using this name in some of our drafts for some time. The President believed that this should be the name of the new organization, and we also felt that it was a lucky name that more than forty countries had fought together under and won victory, and that they could continue to cooperate under it after their victory. But when Stettinius raised this proposal at the conference, we encountered unexpected opposition from the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. Gromyko tentatively suggested the name "World Alliance." Cadogan said that he did not believe that the British government would particularly like the name "United Nations," and had thought of suggesting a name that included the word "alliance." (Note: A few days later, both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom accepted the name "United Nations.")</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative to South Korea Criticizes North Korea's Communization</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 3rd] The U.S. State Department representative to South Korea issued a statement to Korean patriots yesterday, stating first, "The United States made the greatest sacrifices in the war against Japan, while the Soviet Union only joined the war against Japan before Japan's surrender." The meaning implied is that it is unfair to divide Korea along the 38th parallel for occupation. It continued, "The blockade of the 38th parallel hinders the free development of Korea. The United Nations has resolved to work towards abolishing the blockade of the 38th parallel." The statement also loudly appealed to awaken Korean patriots and not be poisoned by communist propaganda. It stated, "Due to the orders of the communist supreme command, North Korea has been communized and is proceeding to communize South Korea. The recent riots and malicious propaganda in South Korea were caused by this order." Finally, the U.S. representative urged the people of North Korea to listen to South Korean broadcasts from the U.S. side in order to convey opinions at any time.</p>
<h3>Real Power of Katayama Cabinet Still Controlled by Socialist Party</h3>
<p>Allocation of Cabinet Posts among Three Parties Largely Decided</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The work of forming a cabinet by the Japan Democratic Party has now progressed to the stage of negotiations for cabinet members. It is generally believed that the final decision will not be made until the 5th. Today, Democratic Party President Ashida visited Katayama and Miki separately, formally requesting the Socialist and Cooperative parties to submit their lists of cabinet nominees. It is understood that the allocation of cabinet seats has been largely decided, with the ratio being 7 for the Democrats (including the Prime Minister), 8 for the Socialists, and 2 for the Cooperatives. The Democratic Party will receive the portfolios of Finance, Transportation, Communications, and three Ministers without Portfolio. The Socialist Party will receive the portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, Labor, Education, and three Ministers without Portfolio. The Cooperative Party will receive the portfolios of Health and Welfare and one Minister without Portfolio. For other important positions held concurrently by Ministers without Portfolio, the Democratic Party will receive the positions of Chief Cabinet Secretary and President of the Construction Agency, and the Socialist Party will receive the positions of Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board and President of the Legal Affairs Agency. Given this allocation and ratio, the real power of the Ashida Cabinet remains in the hands of the Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>Allied Council for Japan: U.S. and Soviet Union Trade Accusations</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative: Soviet Union Discusses Internal Affairs</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The United States on the 3rd accused the Soviet Union of interfering in the organization of the Japanese government. At the same time, the Soviet Union demanded that Ashida, the new Prime Minister who was elected with U.S. consent, be purged and barred from political activity. The mutual accusations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union occurred during a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan, with the representatives of China and the United States supporting the U.S. accusation against the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Major General Kislenko read an eight-page document at the meeting, stating that Japan's economic crisis was deepening, and that the occupying forces immediately refused to organize a government representing the majority of the people. He claimed that the Shidehara, Yoshida, and Katayama cabinets were all incapable of rescuing the economic crisis. Kislenko also claimed that many people in the previous cabinets should have been purged, but they remained in office. He then read a series of names, including Ashida. At this point, the chairman of the meeting, U.S. representative Sebald, stopped Kislenko from continuing to read and retorted, asking what right the Soviet representative had to interfere in the organization of the Japanese cabinet. Sebald stated that the Allied Council had no authority to discuss Japanese political figures. Sebald stated that occupation policy stipulated that the new democratic government of Japan should be produced by the free will of the people. He further stated that discussing Japanese political figures at this time would affect the free choice in organizing the cabinet. Kislenko accused Sebald of depriving him of his right to express opinions on occupation matters. Sebald replied that if the Soviet Union wished to raise the matter, there was a special Preparatory Committee for that, but Kislenko declared that he refused to contact any organization other than the Allied Council. Sebald also stated that MacArthur approved Ashida's appointment as Prime Minister based on democratic procedures.</p>

<h3>Public Buses Briefly Suspended; Cook Causes Injury to Ticket Inspector; Garrison Command Handles Impartially; Three People Detained That Night, Resolved Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The No. 4 public bus running between the Bund and Changyang Road was suspended yesterday at around 5 p.m. because of a conflict on Dalian Road between ticket inspector No. 45 and a cook from the Garrison Command Headquarters. The ticket inspector was beaten and injured, causing all buses on the route to be suspended. At the same time, the No. 7 and No. 11 buses also responded, and the situation became quite serious for a time. Later, the Garrison Commander organized a military trial that night, which was resolved satisfactorily only at 1:30 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>The cause of the incident was that a cook named Xie Daisheng from the Garrison Command Headquarters boarded the No. 358 bus of the No. 4 route on Xuchang Road at 5:10 p.m. yesterday without a ticket. When he got off at the intersection of Dalian Road and Huade Road, he encountered ticket inspector No. 45, Zou Liren. Zou found that he had no ticket and, because he was only wearing a gray military uniform, asked him if he had any identification. Xie showed him an old identification from 1947. Zou said it had expired and was no longer valid, and a dispute ensued. Zou then borrowed a telephone from the nearby Dalian Motor Company and attempted to call the company to request instructions on how to handle the situation. At this time, Xie had invited five or six people to reason with him. At that time, a disagreement arose and the argument escalated into a fight. Although police officer No. 1386 attempted to mediate, his efforts were ineffective. Zou Liren was ultimately outnumbered and beaten to the ground, and then taken to the Garrison Command Headquarters. At this time, Garrison Command Deputy Commander, Army Major General Mei Zhanyi, had already heard the news and was furious. In addition to detaining Xie, he expressed his apologies to the injured ticket inspector on the spot and stated that he was willing to bear all medical expenses and other compensation. At this time, all the employees of the No. 4, No. 7, and No. 11 public bus routes had gone on strike and made three demands: (1) that the Garrison Command punish the offending soldiers, (2) that they be responsible for all medical expenses of the injured person, and (3) that they apologize and guarantee that the same incident would not happen again in the future.</p>
<p>The Garrison Command Headquarters immediately organized a temporary military court at the China Restaurant on Daying Road, the location of the incident. The trial was conducted by Deputy Commander Mei Zhanyi, Chief of Staff Gao Baoshu, and Military Judges Lu Zhengqiang and Mao Yanli. First, Zou Liren was summoned for questioning, but because he was injured and his voice was low, Vice Director of the Transportation Group Ding Weitang relayed the course of events on his behalf. After questioning police officer No. 1386, the perpetrator Xie Daisheng was brought in for questioning. Xie was tied up and interrogated in turn by the officers. Xie confessed that Zhong Shiyang and Wang Chaode had also participated in the beating. The interrogation ended at 1:00 a.m. this morning. Xie, Zhong Shiyang, and Wang Chaode were immediately taken into custody. The injured person was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment, and it was reported that his injuries were not serious.</p>
<p>All three demands made by the public bus company were fully accepted by Garrison Command Deputy Commander Mei, and the dispute was thus resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Ren Xianqun Discusses Rice Rationing Prices: Cannot Be Too Low to Prevent Backflow; Ration Certificates Must Be Issued by the 5th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of comprehensive rice rationing in this city in March, the rice rationing certificates have been issued in two periods, the upper and lower halves of the month, due to the rice source problem. The rice rationing certificates for the first half of the month were originally limited to being issued before the 3rd. However, due to the slow procedures of the Bao-Tian offices in various districts, some people have not yet received them, which has greatly affected the rice rationing work. Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, is scheduled to host a banquet for the district heads of the 30 districts of the city at 6 p.m. today at the China Merchants Bureau on the sixth floor, requesting them to urge the Bao-Jia personnel in the districts to speed up their work and ensure that the rice rationing certificates are issued to the citizens by the 5th. The rice rationing certificates for the second half of the month are also being processed and printed and are scheduled to be issued to the citizens from the 6th to the 8th. In order to strengthen the supervision work, the Allocation Committee will set up one on-site supervisor in each district to supervise on the spot. In addition, there will be several roving supervisors rotating to various districts to monitor, in order to prevent malpractices and strengthen work efficiency. The organization of the Distribution Office of the Committee has been decided as follows: Director, Zhou Yi'e; Deputy Directors, Ji Mingzhai and Gao Junliang. It is divided into five sections: retail store management, certificate issuance, design, warehouse management, and supervision.</p>
<p>Policy Has Been Effective</p>
<p>Recently, there has been much criticism from the outside world regarding the price of rationed rice at 2.4 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), as it is not much different from the market price. Our reporter made a special visit to Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee. According to the discussion, the initial significance of rice rationing is to stabilize the economic foundation, extend the cycle of fluctuations, and recover legal tender to reduce the amount of issuance. Therefore, the price of rationed rice must meet the market price, with a maximum limit of no less than 5% of the market price. The American relief supplies are national in scope and not limited to the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Tianjin), and Guangzhou. The income from rice rationing in the five cities is now used as a national relief fund to promote the initial stabilization of China's economy and then to start reforming the currency system. According to statistics, in 1947, the average monthly rice supply to each citizen in the Shanghai rice market was only six sheng (unit of dry measure) and one he (tenth of a sheng) and two ge (tenth of a he), but the average monthly consumption of each citizen was one dou (ten sheng) and five sheng. Two-thirds of the consumption did not pass through the market and went directly to the consumers.</p>
<p>Worries About Low Grain Prices Harming Farmers</p>
<p>The current government supplies 500,000 dan (unit of dry measure) of rationed rice to Shanghai every month. In addition to foreigners eating bread and northerners eating flour, this accounts for about two-thirds of the monthly rice needs of Shanghai, which already has a decisive force. In this way, even if the price of the other one-third of the rice source fluctuates, there is no fear of it rising to any degree. Looking at the small return of rice prices in the past three days, the rice rationing policy has been effective. Shanghai is a rice consumption area and cannot allow the rice price to be lower than that of the production area; otherwise, it will create a backflow phenomenon with serious consequences. Currently, there are two points that we should study: (1) To prevent the rice price from leading to the rise of other commodity prices, and to reasonably adjust the rice price under this principle. (2) The rice price cannot be too low to encourage merchants to purchase and transport it. It is also necessary to take into account the harm to farmers from low grain prices. If farmers give up production because the harvest from rice cultivation does not cover the cost, the consequences would be worrying. At present, rice prices in various places in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are mostly higher than in this city. If the fixed rationing price of 2.4 million yuan is reduced, the power to control the market will be reduced, the policy will be detached, and a backflow phenomenon will be formed. Therefore, it is impossible to reduce the price of rationed rice. According to Chairman Ren, the rice rationing in this city in March can generate a total income of 1.2 trillion yuan.</p>
<h3>The 9th Gendarmerie Regiment Arrives in Shanghai; The City's Defenses are Further Consolidated</h3>
<p>The 9th Gendarmerie Regiment was ordered to be stationed in Shanghai and arrived in Shanghai by train from Wuxi on the 3rd. It is reported that the defense of the area north of the Suzhou River in this city will be the responsibility of the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Regiment, and the defense south of the Suzhou River will remain the responsibility of the Independent 3rd Battalion. The Independent 3rd Battalion is under the unified command of the 9th Regiment. The defense of this city is therefore further consolidated. The 9th Regiment is also responsible for the security of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway lines. The defense of various places along the Beijing-Shanghai line has been changed to be the responsibility of the 1st Gendarmerie Regiment, but the escort service on the Beijing-Shanghai line will still be undertaken by the 9th Regiment.</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Committee for All Circles to Receive and Comfort Soldiers Going on Expeditions, the Shanghai Garrison District, the Shanghai Regiment Garrison District, the Air Force Supply Headquarters, the Wusong Fortress Headquarters, the Military School Graduates Investigation Office, the Military Service Association, the Friends of the Military Society, and other agencies and groups, in order to welcome the new Port Commander Zhou Lixing, Navy Base Commander Dong Muchen, and Commander Luo of the 9th Gendarmerie Regiment, yesterday held a preparatory meeting. Xie Renzhao presided over the meeting and decided to hold a tea party to welcome them at the Friends of the Military Society at 2 p.m. on the 5th. Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Chuan Zhengmo, Shao Baichang, Xie Renzhao, and Wang Weimin were elected as the presidium.</p>

<p>Education</p>
<p>There are eight proposals from the bureau: among them, (1) It is requested that the Education Bureau increase the number of classes in each national school in the urban area by at least 200 classes to accommodate out-of-school children, which was discussed more enthusiastically. The resolution passed one by one: (1) Please increase the number of classes in national schools by at least 200 classes from this semester. If there are difficulties due to school buildings, please ask the Education Bureau to add schools. (2) The regular and temporary expenses of the 200 classes should be included in the budget of this year by the municipal government.

There are a total of eight points in this proposal, and the senators discussed it for a long time, but as a result, the general assembly voted on two opinions, and the number of votes did not exceed the legal number, so it was resolved to retain it.

<h3>Military Service Association Receives Reporters to Report and Explain Conscription Doubts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Fang Zhi, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Military Service Association of this city, and Feng Youzhen, Deputy Director, received the press at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road at 3 p.m. yesterday to explain the significance of conscription. Commander Chuan Zhengmo of the Shanghai Garrison District, Commander Chen Tianqiao of the Regiment Garrison District, Secretary Lei Kenan of the Military Service Association, Section Chief Yao Wenyin of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and others were present to report on their respective duties. Before Chairman Fang delivered his speech, he asked Commander Fu to first report on the progress of military service. Mr. Chuan said: The principles and methods of conscription in this city this year have been decided at the military service meeting a few days ago. The task of the division and regiment garrison districts is to execute the orders of the Ministry of National Defense and strive to complete the conscription task as scheduled. Although there were some shortcomings in the conscription work last year, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the assistance of all parties. Since it has been decided to use lottery conscription this year, in order to avoid desertion, there must be a definite guarantor for volunteers, and those who are conscripted by lottery must have a certain amount of wealth. I hope that all sectors of society will strictly supervise the military service personnel at all levels. If there is any malpractice, it will be severely punished after verification. Chairman Fang gave a detailed analysis of the domestic and foreign regulations, and then said: The central government has decided to conscript 6,000 people in this city this year, which is not a large number. All young men who have a sense of nation and ethnicity will consciously and enthusiastically join the army. Those who commit malpractice in conscription and sabotage military service will also be sanctioned by national law. As for the settling-in allowance for new recruits, an improved method has been established this year. The living conditions and treatment of new recruits after they enter the camp will also be improved to make them feel at home when they enter the camp. Mr. Fang specifically introduced the article "The Last Stand of Americans in China" by the American journalist Uttley, and called on those who have money to donate generously and those who have the strength to join the army enthusiastically, pointing out that the current Communist banditry is no longer a simple domestic rebellion but has the support of an international background. Then, Feng Youzhen, Chen Tianqiao, Tan Yimin, Yao Wenying, and others spoke in succession.</p>
<h3>Yao Wenying Puts Forward Three Difficulties</h3>
<p>Yao Wenying raised three difficulties: (1) The current military service order is suitable for rural areas and small towns, but it is difficult to conduct surveys in large cities, especially in today's Shanghai, where the population moves frequently. For example, most of the young men surveyed in June last year have already changed their addresses this year. (2) The central government stipulates that the quota of service should be allocated according to the population, but it is quite difficult to do so in practice. For example, Yangshupu District is mostly composed of workers, and many workers apply for deferred conscription and are approved, so the quota cannot be allocated according to the population. The Civil Affairs Bureau has now decided to separate the factory area and the residential area and allocate them separately. (3) When surveying young men of age last year, there were originally 1,088 Bao (unit of household administration) in this city, and 105 Bao have been added this year, so the number of people to be allocated to each Bao must be re-examined.</p>
<h3>Election Disputes Settled with Apologies</h3>
<p>In the past, election disputes occurred in the North Railway Station District. The victims, Zhang Jun, Mao Pingshao, and others, sued Pan Jemei, Lu Huimin, Yang Guangming, Zhu Chunyan, Zhao Xudong, and others for obstructing the election, obstructing freedom, injury, and public danger. Subsequently, Director Fang and Jiang Yiping and Wang Liwu jointly came forward to mediate. The defendants expressed their apologies to the plaintiffs, and the grievances between the two sides were released. It is heard that the District Attorney's Office has decided not to prosecute the case.</p>
<h3>The Aftercare Committee of Discharged Workers from Shenxin Asks for Reinstatement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] During the labor unrest at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, 400 workers were dismissed by the factory for allegedly inciting the labor unrest and causing trouble. After the labor unrest, the Huxi Cotton Mill Workers established an aftercare committee to be responsible for handling aftercare matters. At 3 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Guozhen, Zhu Kangyu, representatives of the dismissed workers, and Tang Guifen, Bai Jiaquan, Zhang Wenlong, representatives of the aftercare committee, visited Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and made two requests: (1) Those arrested workers who are guilty should be sentenced, and those who are innocent should be released immediately. (2) All dismissed workers should be allowed to be reinstated. Deputy Director Zhao said: (1) The arrested workers will be released after the circumstances are clarified and if they are indeed innocent. (2) If the dismissed workers are indeed wronged, they can be reinstated.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Continues to Mediate the Dismissal of the New Asia Hotel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than 150 dismissed workers from the New Asia Hotel are currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau due to their request for continued employment. It turned out that after the New Asia Hotel was leased to the US military advisory group last month, all the workers' personnel were obtained by Huang Zhenshan with contracting rights, and new workers were hired separately. Later, after several consultations with the old workers, the other party only agreed to hire 41 people, but it has not been fulfilled to this day, so they still ask the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate.</p>
<h3>The Manager of Fuxin Bookstore Was Charged and Released on Bail After Interrogation</h3>
<p>Detective novelist Cheng Xiaoging found out that the Fuxin Bookstore in this port copied Li's old work "The Mysterious Thief" before the war and reprinted the two books "The Atomic Thief" and "The Masked Girl" under Cheng's name. He filed a criminal lawsuit through lawyer Lu Shaozong for violating the copyright law and because the content of the two books was bad, which damaged his reputation. The Criminal Court No. 2 of the District Court opened the trial yesterday. The defendant, Zhou Zhifang, the manager of Fuxin, said that he was deceived by Wang Danian. Wu Tingchang ordered the defendant to publish an apology in the newspaper for reconciliation in the civil lawsuit part. The defendant also paid a shop guarantee of 20 million yuan, and the retrial was scheduled for March 15.</p>
<h3>How Many Civil Servants Shed Tears of Sympathy; The Monthly Salary of Senior Appointed Personnel is Only Enough to Eat Flatbread to Make a Living; Lu Hao's Wife Passed Away After Her Husband</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After Lu Hao, an employee of the Finance Bureau, committed suicide by jumping into the river because his wife was critically ill and he could not afford medical treatment, his wife, Gu Ping, also died of illness on the morning of the 2nd. His friends and colleagues are now raising funds for him to take care of the funeral arrangements. All the employees of the Social Affairs Bureau donated a total of 21.695 million yuan, which was sent to his family yesterday. When they launched the fundraising campaign after Lu Hao's suicide, it was originally intended to save the living, but his wife eventually died, so the money was used for the funeral of Lu Hao and his wife. Faced with this tragic fact, all the employees of the Social Affairs Bureau expressed their deep grief. They believed that Lu Hao's death was enough to reflect the predicament of the more than 50,000 public employees in Shanghai, which had reached its peak. Today, a senior appointed personnel with a monthly salary of 200 yuan can get 3.995 million yuan per month, which can buy 399 and a half flatbread fritters. On average, you can get 13 sets per day. If you distribute it to a family of three, husband, wife, and children, there is no money to buy boiled water, let alone anything else. With this, how could Lu Hao survive? How could his wife not die! They all belong to civil servants and have a sense of sadness for the death of a rabbit. The fundraising campaign was particularly enthusiastic, and all the workers also helped with 5,000 to 10,000 yuan to buy fritters. They all believed that no matter how much money, even if it was just one yuan, its significance was very profound.</p>
<h3>The Murderer in the Female Corpse Case on Xueyuan Road in Nanshi Confessed to Murder for Money</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of the unidentified female corpse found on Xueyuan Road in Nanshi has now been fully revealed. Han Heshang, the suspect arrested on the 28th of last month, is the murderer Wei Fuming, also known as Wei Heshang, nicknamed Pitou Heshang. On the eve of the murder, someone witnessed the deceased leaving the Great World by rickshaw with a man and heading south. According to the murderer's confession after being arrested, it was only known that when they took the rickshaw south, they first went to the rolled noodle stall at Sanpailou to eat meat and drink alcohol together, and then went to the wooden house in Guilin Village on Guangqi Road. Taking advantage of her being drunk and asleep, he killed her with a kitchen knife. However, because the corpse was heavy and could not be moved, it was discarded on the roadside. According to the murderer's confession, the motive for the murder was mainly because the woman had a gold bracelet on her arm, so he had the evil intention of murdering for money.</p>
<h3>Fire on Jiangning Road: Girl Dies in Flames</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning around 3:40 AM, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 74, Lane 685, Jiangning Road, a coppersmith workshop owned by Hu Huiquan. The fire spread to the neighboring No. 72 and No. 76. The Xinza District fire brigade received the alarm and dispatched trucks to the scene to extinguish the blaze, which was put out by approximately 5:00 AM. When the fire broke out, the shop owner's daughter, Jinmei (eight years old), was unable to escape and perished in the flames. Yesterday morning, the girl's body was recovered by officers dispatched from the Jiangning Police Precinct. Hu Huiquan, the originator of the fire, and the apprentice who caused the accident have been detained by the police for interrogation.</p>
<h3>National Bank Employee Who Stole Gold Bricks Appeals for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Chen Yuansheng, an employee of the Custody Section of the Central Bank, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the District Court for embezzling and selling gold bricks from the vault. The case caused a great sensation at the time. Chen, dissatisfied with the verdict, has applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial, arguing that he was a temporary employee of the Central Bank's Custody Section and not a public official, making the conviction for corruption inappropriate. The Supreme Court has recently ordered the local District Court to investigate with the Central Bank whether Chen Yuansheng was indeed a temporary employee and whether the application of corruption regulations was appropriate.</p>
<h3>Escaped War Criminal Seeks to Avoid Death Penalty: Nakano Hisayoshi Requests Retrial</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Nakano Hisayoshi, the Japanese war criminal who escaped from prison, was previously sentenced to death by a military tribunal and is currently being held in Shanghai Prison. Within days, he can apply to the original trial court for a retrial. Nakano, based on this provision, submitted a written defense to the military tribunal, which was forwarded to the Ministry of National Defense for review.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Public Utilities in Economic Turmoil: An Analysis of the Burden on Citizens and Possible Solutions</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>The intensity of China's post-war economic turmoil surpasses that of wartime. The prices of various daily necessities are soaring endlessly, causing most people to feel severely threatened. Even enjoying public utilities such as water, electricity, transportation, gas, and telephones has become an unbearable burden. Because price control cannot be solved locally by the government. We, who bear municipal responsibilities, find it very difficult to find stable strategies in this overall environment of economic turmoil and feel extremely anxious! The following suggestions are based on facts and needs and offered for the consideration of enlightened individuals within the country.</p>
<p>(1) The Inflation Rate of General Prices in Shanghai</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest market in the country, and naturally, its economic sensitivity is more acute. Since the recovery two and a half years ago, by examining the retail price index of domestic goods in the city (the following table is based on the statistics compiled by the Municipal Government Statistics Office, using the prices from January to June of the 26th year as the base), we can clearly understand the extent of price inflation:</p>
<p>The above table indicates that the general price level in January of the 37th year was between 110,000 and 250,000 times higher than before the war. It is noteworthy that the later the period, the higher the rate of increase; that is, the rate of increase of various factors related to public utilities (the multiple increase compared to the 26th year) also has the same trend. Consider the following table:</p>
<p>(2) The Inflation Rate of Public Utility Prices in Shanghai</p>
<p>In such a severe situation of price fluctuations, there are two ways to maintain public utilities and seek improvement in their services: one is to calculate the cost and adjust prices, and the other is to maintain the original price and have the government provide subsidies. The city's public utilities were once subsidized from March to May of the 36th year, but because this failed to prevent price increases and the amount of subsidies grew larger and larger, the Executive Yuan announced the cancellation in June and gradually adjusted prices. The inflation rate (the multiple increase compared to the 26th year) is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>From the above statistics, it is noteworthy that the average inflation rate of public utilities in January of the 37th year was 59,000 times, while the average inflation rate of the factors that directly affect the price of public utilities in the same month reached 104,000 times, and the inflation rate of the general price index reached more than 150,000 times. Whether public utilities are leading price increases is self-evident.</p>
<p>(3) Calculation Formulas and the Responsibilities of the Public Utilities Bureau</p>
<p>Public utilities are a link in the entire economy. Since the entire economy is undergoing drastic changes, public utility prices cannot help but change accordingly; but the change is passive, not active. This is because the prices of the main factors related to the cost of public utilities are determined separately by the competent authorities. For example, the cost of living index is reviewed and determined monthly by the Shanghai Cost of Living Index Review Committee. The price index for metals is compiled by the Municipal Government Statistics Office based on market prices of metals; the price of coal is determined by the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; the price of oil is determined by the Export-Import Management Committee; and the exchange rate is published by the Central Bank. These price increases affect the increase in the cost of public utilities, so in order to maintain their operations, it is necessary to adjust their prices. Calculating the prices of public utilities requires a set of fair formulas. This formula was formulated by the National Economic Commission based on the statistics of various public utilities. After the draft was sent to Shanghai, it was revised by the Municipal Government together with representatives of the City Council, Mr. Li Wenjie and Mr. Wang Zhuyi, and representatives of the company. The Economic Commission then compiled the final formula and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for promulgation and uniform implementation throughout the country. The main parts of this formula can be divided into "base numbers" and "factors." "Base numbers" are obtained based on statistics, such as how many pounds of coal are required per kilowatt-hour of electricity, which is relatively fixed. "Factors" are variable, such as the current price of each pound of coal. If the product of the base number multiplied by the factor is multiplied by a percentage, the sum is the cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity. The efforts and responsibility of the Public Utilities Bureau lie in doing its best to urge various public utilities to improve efficiency and reduce the "base number." Other "factors," such as the cost of living index, coal prices, oil prices, and foreign exchange, are not within the control of the Public Utilities Bureau and can only hope that other relevant agencies will do their best to control them. In the midst of economic turmoil, the consistent policy of the Public Utilities Bureau is to try its best to stabilize public utilities. We achieved this in the second half of the 35th year, so the Ta Kung Pao's opinion poll at the beginning of the 36th year expressed satisfaction with this. After June of the 36th year, price increases were like wild horses, and the policy of the Public Utilities Bureau was to enable public utilities to maintain operations, allowing price increases but with rules, at most once a month, while taking into account the burden on citizens and maintaining the right to review and reduce prices. Therefore, when we review the prices calculated by public utilities according to the formula each month, three representatives from the City Council also participate and try their best to suppress them, in order to force various public utilities to automatically improve efficiency and reduce the "base number," and even assess the "base number" of labor costs, ordering certain public utility companies not to add any more employees in order to save on labor costs. Why? It is to take into account the burden on citizens, as can be seen from the table below. The highest principle of the Public Utilities Bureau is "do not forget the citizens, do not protect the companies." I believe that the City Council and the Municipal Government have a common desire to act in a way that is responsible to the citizens, while maintaining a fair position and convincing various public utility companies so that they have no complaints.</p>
<p>The Increase Rate of Each Main Factor in February Compared to January</p>
<p>According to this ratio, the percentage that each public utility should increase in February should be higher than the current actual price. See the table below:</p>
<p>(4) Differences in Citizens' Sensitivity</p>
<p>In recent years, the income of ordinary people has naturally continued to increase in numbers due to the depreciation of currency. If everyone's income were calculated according to the cost of living index every month based on the base amount before the war, there would be no problem. However, in fact, there are great differences, and each is different. Therefore, the degree to which each person feels the pressure of prices, and even the degree to which they feel the pressure of public utility prices, also varies greatly. For example, the minimum wage for laborers before the war was 16 yuan per month, but now the base salary has increased to 37 yuan. If calculated according to the January cost of living index of over 92,000 times, the actual monthly wage is more than 3.4 million yuan, more than 200,000 times higher than before the war. As for public school teachers, with a monthly salary of 110 yuan, their monthly income is only 3.145 million yuan according to the latest salary standards, only 34,500 times higher than before the war. Other industries and businesses cannot estimate the multiple of their income in this chaotic and abnormal economic situation, but it can be asserted that it is many times higher than that of public school teachers.</p>
<p>The different multiples of income for the four classes of people (scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants) after the war have created different perceptions of public utility prices. Some citizens, whose income increases according to the cost of living index, feel less pressure from prices, especially from public utility prices; however, those whose income does not increase according to the cost of living index or cannot increase according to the index feel a heavy pressure from prices and public utility fees. We may as well do another analysis.</p>
<p>Before the war, a middle-class family living in Shanghai, enjoying material comforts, spent approximately the following proportions of its income on various expenses:</p>
<p>Rent 20% Public Utility Fees, etc. 20%</p>
<p>Food 20% Entertainment and Savings 20%</p>
<p>Clothing 20% Total 100%</p>
<p>For greater clarity, a brief analysis of the public utility expenses borne by a middle-class family with a monthly income of 200 yuan before the war is as follows:</p>
<p>Electricity (40 kWh) 7.20 yuan</p>
<p>Tap Water (20 cubic meters) 2.20 yuan</p>
<p>Telephone (65 calls) 6.50 yuan</p>
<p>Gas (40 cubic meters) 2.40 yuan</p>
<p>Tram (4 times daily) 6.00 yuan</p>
<p>Total 33.30 yuan</p>
<p>Proportion of Income 16.65%</p>
<p>After the war, if this middle-class family with a base salary of 200 yuan is a public school teacher, their actual income in February of this year would be 5.5 million yuan according to the method promulgated by the central government. If calculated according to the January cost of living index (95,200 times) (A) for the business community, their income would be 19.04 million yuan. (B) If half is calculated according to the cost of living index, their income would be 9.5 million yuan. According to the public utility prices in January, their expenses can be analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Electricity (40 kWh) 350,000 yuan</p>
<p>Tap Water (20 cubic meters) 173,000 yuan</p>
<p>Telephone (60 calls) 144,000 yuan</p>
<p>Gas (40 cubic meters) 900,000 yuan</p>
<p>Tram (Monthly Pass) 560,000 yuan</p>
<p>(For Public School Teachers 240,000)</p>
<p>Total</p>
<p>(For Public School Teachers) 2,127,000 yuan 1,807,000 yuan</p>
<p>Proportion of Public School Teachers' Income 32%</p>
<p>Proportion of Business Community (A) Income 2.8%</p>
<p>Proportion of Business Community (B) Income 23.6%</p>
<p>According to the above analysis, the public's sensitivity to current public utility prices can be divided into at least three categories: (1) Public school teachers feel a double burden, accounting for about one-third of all expenses, and those who enjoy public utilities beyond this standard bear more than one-third of all expenses. Their various living expenses can be analyzed approximately as follows:</p>
<p>Rent 6% Public Utility Fees, etc. 33%</p>
<p>Food 57% Entertainment 2%</p>
<p>Clothing 2% Total 100%</p>
<p>At the same time, higher-level public school teachers feel even more difficult, because their income cannot increase in a linear proportion to their base salary. (2) For the (A) type of business community, such as industrial workers, public utility expenses are slightly smaller in percentage terms than before the war, because the average inflation rate of public utilities is only 59,000 times, while the cost of living index has reached 95,000 times (January of the 37th year). (3) For the (B) type of business community, the increase in the burden of public utility fees compared to before the war is 7%, which is not too serious. From this analysis, unless the government controls prices effectively, the treatment of public school teachers should be improved to achieve rationality. Furthermore, it can be seen that the prices of public utilities increase according to rules and are not unreasonable. The reason for feeling threatened is the uneven distribution of income among the four classes of people in society. At the same time, the number of people in the entire society whose income can be calculated according to the cost of living index is still small, and undoubtedly, the general public still feels pain. This is a serious social and economic problem that cannot be solved by simply planning from public utilities alone.</p>
<p>(5) Possible Solutions</p>
<p>According to the above explanation, it is clear that the instability of public utility prices is entirely a consequence of economic turmoil. With an unhealthy overall economic system and the continuous rise of the general price track, public utility prices cannot be independently stabilized. Because the economic system is like a set of gears in a clock, with the large gears moving forward, the small gears are forced to move. But even when there is no solution, we should still seek solutions. We have to add a reduction gear to the small public utility gear, that is, to make a mandatory reduction when using the calculation formula, and sell it as an increase in efficiency, which has been explained in Section (3). In addition, the remedial measure is subsidy, which is the most immediate solution among temporary solutions. This point can be discussed in two points as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The direct subsidy system was tried out from March to May of last year, but the results were not good. Because the inherent shortcomings of this system make public utilities rely on the government and not seek improvement. At the same time, it is unfair for the people of the whole country to subsidize the public utilities enjoyed by Shanghai alone. The total direct subsidy figure is huge and needs to be adjusted monthly.</p>
<p>(B) Indirect subsidies, that is, allowing the government to give stable exchange rates for two or three months for the fuels used by public utilities, such as coal, oil, and materials such as alum for water production, so that the cost of public utilities is not directly and completely affected by high exchange rates or price fluctuations, and the inflation rate can be reduced. This method is more likely to be tried out, but in times of currency inflation and devaluation, this measure will inevitably be difficult. For example, when public school teachers were allocated in kind last year, the difference from the market price was not far off at the beginning of the implementation, and the government subsidized a small amount, but in less than a few months, the difference from the market price became huge, turning into a major expenditure for the government. The subsidy policy for transportation, postal, and telecommunications businesses is also the same. Once the government cancels subsidies due to its inability to support them, the intensity of the increase can be predicted. Therefore, if this measure must be implemented, it must continue indefinitely. At the same time, it must also be fully supported by the Central Bank, and technical details may need to be carefully discussed.</p>
<h3>Hongsha Cargo Ship Capsizes in Wind at Huangtiangang Port, Jiangyin</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiangyin Bureau, 2nd] Cai Zhengxi, a native of Tangyin County, Henan Province, loaded 65 tons of red sand (for foundry work) on behalf of Lu Yongxiang at No. 2, Lane 49, Datagu Road, Tongfu Road, Shanghai, and was transporting it from the Jingda River estuary to Shanghai. When the vessel arrived at the port, it was to be towed by Yangzi Company's Yang Xuan Wheel tugboat to Shanghai via the inland river. The towing fee was 2.9 million, plus an additional 4 million due to the ship's heavy load, for a total of 24 cargo ships. Upon reaching the vicinity of Xingu, another 8 cargo ships were added to the tow. When the towing vessels arrived at the Xiajiang River surface, they could not proceed due to the rising tide. The towing cable was cut and the tugboats sailed away. On the first day of the month, at approximately 4 a.m., a sudden gale arose, and by 6 a.m., all the cargo ships had sunk. The seven crew members swam ashore. The loss is estimated at over 5 billion. In the afternoon, ship owner Cai Zhengxi telegraphed Shanghai cargo owner Lu Yongxiang, who came to Cheng (Jiangyin) today (the 2nd) to negotiate with the Yangzi Company.</p>
<p>Crew Swims Ashore, Losses Exceed 5 Billion</p>
<h3>Suzhou Prison Food Supply Dwindling, Requesting 10 Billion for Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Bureau, 3rd] The Suzhou High Court reports that the prisoner food supply in various prisons under its jurisdiction is running out. The food supply remaining in the Lion's Mouth First Prison is sufficient for only a few days. With fluctuating prices, the budgeted funds are also insufficient. A telegram was sent to the Department of Judicial Administration requesting an allocation of 10 billion yuan before the 10th of this month to address the emergency.</p>
<h3>Five Prisoners Escape in Suzhou: Guards and Watchmen Detained</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Bureau, 2nd] On the afternoon of February 29th, five prisoners escaped from the Suzhou High Court Guardhouse on Siqian Street in this city. They have not been apprehended. After receiving the report, the High Court immediately issued a letter to the Wu District Prosecutor's Office to investigate responsibility. Prosecutor Luo Shibin was dispatched to investigate and determined that Wu Yi, the officer on duty at the station, Zhang Guohui, the head guard, and Liu Yunda and Liu Zhenlin, guards, bore significant responsibility. They were taken into custody pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Bandits Kidnap Cui Bosheng, Shoot Wife in Leg</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wujin Bureau, 2nd] Cui Bosheng, 31, from Zhanggongqiao, Henghe Township, Anjiashe District, was a former deputy township head of Xixiang. One day at 7 p.m., six or seven bandits in plain clothes broke down the door with guns and kidnapped Cui. His 70-year-old mother, Li, and wife, He, tried to stop them. One of the bandits fired a shot, hitting He in the leg. The bandits rushed away. Friends and relatives have been searching for him for days without success. He was taken to the city for treatment by her family, and is not expected to be disabled.

<h3>Livestock Epidemic Prevention in Ten Counties in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>[Report from our Guilin Bureau, February 29th] Bovine plague is extremely rampant in Guizhou Province. According to statistics, more than 10,000 cattle died of plague in the past year. The Provincial Government has organized mobile epidemic prevention teams before the spread of bovine plague this spring, which will go to Lingui, Yangshuo, Lipu, Xiuren, Liujiang, Rongxian, Liujiang, Xincheng, Yishan, Hechi, Nandan and other ten counties next month to establish an epidemic prevention line of 600 miles along the highway. All cattle on the ground ten miles to the left and right of the highway will be gathered by the local government to wait for injection. At the same time, because the vaccine is made from cattle, and cattle are expensive, the cost of the vaccine is extremely high, resulting in the failure to implement epidemic prevention work universally in the past. The Guangmen Livestock Conservation Institute has researched and changed to using domestic rabbits to mass-produce low-cost injection solutions, and has successfully manufactured them. After experiments, the results are good. It is expected that the epidemic prevention work of cattle in this province this year can be ensured without worry.</p>

<p>[Report from our Changsha Bureau, 1st] Garbage is piling up in Changsha City. In some remote streets and alleys, pedestrians can barely find a place to put their feet, and all the houses are surrounded by garbage. According to informal estimates, there are at least more than 3 million tons. According to the investigation of the Provincial Police Bureau, because Hunan produces coal, every family in the city uses smokeless coal for cooking. This mixture of coal slag, fruit peels, paper scraps and miscellaneous items produces at least 10 tons of new garbage every day. The police bureau currently has 146 cleaners, and their maximum daily work performance is to clear 5 tons of garbage. The two trucks responsible for transporting the garbage may be dispatched for three days a month.

<h3>A Tour of Xianghui College, the Successor to Fudan After its Relocation; A Vast Paradise at the Head of the Jialing River</h3>
<p>In the morning, the air is fresh. We take a tourist bus from Chongqing to Beibei, and the scenery along the way is beautiful, making us feel very happy. In a moment, we arrive at Beibei Station. Passing through the clean streets of Beibei, we take a ferry from the pier to the other side of the river, and slowly climb up hundreds of stone steps. Then, we are in Xiaba - "Paradise".</p>
<p>Xiaba, like Huaxi Dam and Shaping Dam, is a well-known birthplace of academic culture. The National Fudan University laid its foundation here, and during the War of Resistance against Japan, everyone knew about it, both domestically and abroad. Now that Fudan has relocated back to Shanghai, the newly established private Xianghui College is thriving on this fertile land. Moreover, the French parasol trees along the road are arranged neatly like two rows of geese in formation. Two bicycles chase each other swiftly, as if searching for the spring light. The warm sunlight shines on the roof of Deng Hui Hall, and the glass windows reflect shimmering gold, making the majestic building appear even more magnificent.</p>
<p>We walk out of the reception room with President Xu Fengxi, talking as we go, leaving a portrait of the beautiful Paradise.</p>
<p>Full of Energy</p>
<p>President Xu was formerly the Dean of Students at Fudan University, a well-known psychologist. He is very stout, with a large belly, and speaks and walks with authority, full of energy. Hanging high in the auditorium are inscriptions by party and state elders: one by the late Chairman Lin, "Virtue Reigns Supreme"; one by Chairman Chiang, "High Esteem"; and one by Inspector-General Yu, "Study to Serve the Country." Rows of long benches are marked with student numbers, and there is no disorder when students take their assigned seats during meetings. The exam hall is set up in this sacred and inviolable place, and the surrounding arrangements are filled with a solemn atmosphere, dignified and majestic!</p>
<p>The classrooms are scattered on both sides of the auditorium, with a total of about twenty, large and small. The intensity of light and the position of the windows are carefully considered. Outside the doors of two large classrooms, the corridors are crowded with students, listening attentively to the lectures inside, some hurriedly taking notes, and some with a knowing smile on their lips. The desire for knowledge drives them, and they don't seem to feel the fatigue in their waists and legs at all.</p>
<p>The Xianghui Library's collection of books in the stacks is not large, but the number of newspapers and magazines displayed in the reading room is not small. However, from the constant stream of people going in and out in front of the door, and from the busy people working at their desks in the quiet room, it is particularly evident that "there are too many monks and too little gruel." President Xu has the same feeling. He says very frankly, "What we lack most is books." My friend Wei Shoufu, a reporter, will launch an "Xianghui Alumni Association" and prepare for a book donation campaign. May it be successful soon. Mental food is in the academy, and how serious is that panic!</p>
<p>In the male dormitories, most of the doors of each building and each room are open, and red paper couplets are pasted on the doors of every household, creating a new atmosphere. The female dormitories are mostly closed, and security is very strict everywhere in the courtyard. The ban "Men are Not Allowed" is posted high on the wall. However, next to the bamboo fence, there are quite a few young men and women talking intimately.</p>
<p>The Youth Welfare Society has departments for postal and telecommunications, social events, food, laundry, barbering... Although the place is small, it has everything, and it is economical and convenient. The Gongyan Club broadcasts current affairs and music every night. More than a thousand teachers and students from the entire school gather here, "worrying about the world's troubles before anyone else, and enjoying the world's pleasures after everyone else."</p>
<p>On the sports field, two teams of girls are competing in basketball. At this time, the score is seven to seven, and the game is very close and hard-fought.</p>
<p>Passing around the farm, deep in the green woods, is the professors' residence - Fudan New Village.</p>
<p>Sharing Joy and Hardship</p>
<p>The professors are busy with research and teaching, and the professors' wives are just as busy in the kitchen. The education sector has always been a noble but impoverished profession, and it is rare that they are willing to share joy and hardship together.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Mosheng, the director of the Department of Chinese Literature and History, has a silver beard and talks endlessly about his stories during the War of Resistance, very energetically. Professor Xu Dean is an expert in philology and loves to talk about alliteration and reduplication. Director Fang Jing of the Department of Foreign Languages' words are full of rich poetic meaning. Professor Zhou Tongdan is the great disciple of Master Xiong Shili, with a dignified appearance. Liu Juemin, the director of the Department of Economics, is currently the president of the Central Daily News in the wartime capital, and speaks with diplomatic language. Professor Sun Liangong's hair is almost bald. Professor Bai Jimei's voice is still very loud.</p>
<p>The student dining hall is divided into male and female sections, and the meals are simple and plain, with rarely any special dishes. The female students' meal fees are the lowest, only over 100,000 yuan last month. The atmosphere of diligence, hard work, and frugality is most prevalent here, and suits and Western clothes are not valued. Currently, there are a total of four types of scholarships and grants: Xiangbo Scholarship, Denghui Grant, Tang Fenglai Scholarship, and Lan Wenbin Grant. Although the amount is not large, it is not easy to obtain, so once you are nominated, your worth increases tenfold, no wonder the examination system can be so strict.</p>
<p>There are dozens of various new and old newspaper and magazine societies and organizations. However, they are all mainly "academic", and there is no room for party activities. Even hometown associations are prohibited. Academic independence and freedom of thought are the greatest characteristics of Xianghui College, and this spirit is especially worthy of</p>
<p>The buildings in the Hanbing Hall and the Journalism Hall areas, it is said that they will be used to add Xianghui Middle School this spring. The affiliated Lixue Primary School will also increase the number of classes. If famous professors can be hired, the long-planned journalism department, horticulture department, etc. can be established immediately. "Xianghui University" will definitely be realized within three years.</p>
<p>Dean of Instruction Dr. Shao Xiufeng told the reporter about the founding process in great detail. Before leaving, he said, "Now, Mr. Ma Xiangbo and Mr. Li Denghui have both passed away, and the significance of our school commemorating the two educators is even more special and important!"</p>
<p>The Jialing River is constantly rolling with green waves, with the back waves pushing the front waves. The splashes of water lightly hit the small boat, like bright pearls... As the reporter went up the river and stepped onto the North Wenquan Highway to North Hot Springs, looking down from the top of the mountain at that vast paradise, a kind impression was vaguely reflected in my eyes. I wish the youth in Basha, like the flowers of spring and the fruits of autumn, forever flourish and grow strong! (Reported by Yin Wei in Chongqing in February of the 37th year of the Republic.)</p>

<h3>Xiangdao Football Report - Special Silver Shield, Chinese Teams Dominate - Xingdao and Dongfang Gain Final Rights - Xingdao Triumphantly Defeats Buses · Dongfang Bravely Conquers Jiezhi</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The football schedule for Saturday (the 27th) was, as listed, the Special Silver Shield semi-finals, with two matches played at the Causeway Bay Ground and the Police Ground respectively. As a result of the battles, Xingdao won against Buses, and Dongfang overwhelmed Jiezhi, with both scores being two to one, thus leading to a situation where Xingdao and Dongfang compete for supremacy. In the Group B matches, the Naval B team eliminated with a score of four to one. The Buses B team, Nanhua rallied with determination, defeating Zhonghua three to one, and will compete with the Naval B team for the Group B championship. Let's first look at the battle on the Causeway Bay side, where Xingdao and Buses fought fiercely. Comparing their lineups, Buses was not as good as Xingdao, but the Tiger team was affected by Song Lingsheng's knee injury, which prevented him from playing, and the defense suffered. Furthermore, the forwards encountered Buses' tight defense. He Yingfen and Zhu Yongqiang were injured one after another, Tan Jiangbai committed eight fouls, and Qian Chihui even used his fists to hit Xu Jingcheng. As both were Chinese teams, they really shouldn't have played like that!</p>
<p>Speaking of the performances of both sides, Xingdao was better than Buses in both technique and experience, and Buses was even inferior to Xingdao in the application of tactics. After the start of the battle, we clearly saw that Buses attempted to subdue Xingdao with brute force. Jiangbai first injured Yingfen, and after scoring a penalty kick, the entire team retreated to defend, adopting a "man-to-man" marking style to deal with Xingdao,抢ball whenever possible, hoping to maintain the lead. Unfortunately, Buses' strategist overlooked one point: a match lasts for ninety minutes. If you want to retreat and defend after scoring a goal in the first half, without any offense, how can you withstand the beating? As expected, in the last ten minutes, Buses' defenders were exhausted, and although they injured Zhu Yongqiang again, the Tiger team finally equalized the score.</p>
<p>Looking at the battle situation: it was only tense, not exciting. At the beginning of the match, the Tiger team rushed to the front, and Jinhe shot wide, while Zhaorong lost a series of opportunities in front of the goal. At the fourteenth minute, Jiangbai injured Yingfen. In the chaos, Buses took the opportunity to counterattack, and Shuoyou got the ball and shot, hitting the post and bouncing out. Wenzhi rushed forward and was blocked by Songsheng. Xingdao was penalized with a penalty kick, which Shuoyou scored. At this time, Yingfen returned to the field and switched positions with Yongqiang, but his movements were not as agile as before. In the first half, Xingdao lost first. In the second half, Buses intended to retreat and defend, but Xingdao attacked fiercely. However, Buses set up a human wall, and the Tiger team forced six corner kicks one after another, but achieved nothing. After thirty-two minutes, Yongqiang was kicked injured and left the field. Seeing that it was about to end, Jinhai was forced to rush forward to assist in the attack. Once, Yingfen took a corner kick. In the melee in Buses' territory, Songsheng scored in the chaos, after the tie, the Tiger team continued to advance bravely, forcing another corner kick. Jinhe kicked well, and Zhaorong hooked the ball in with his foot, two to one, Xingdao won the final victory.</p>

<p>On the Police Ground side, there was also a semi-final battle, with Jiezhi and Dongfang competing for supremacy. Jiezhi's condition has not been very active recently, while Dongfang has made progress. You Huaxing of Jiezhi took the field after recovering from illness, and Huang Jingcong's leg injury has not yet healed, which is even more worrying.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire match, Jiezhi had tried its best to fight. It maintained an undefeated record in the first half and even scored first in the second half, but it conceded two goals in just two minutes. Jiezhi's defense should be responsible for this. Originally, in a close match, in addition to skill, luck and audience support are also needed. This battle was like this. Jiezhi shot the ball three times, all hitting the goal post, and the audience enthusiastically cheered for Dongfang, who was finally able to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>After the first half ended in a draw, the two teams engaged in a fierce battle in the second half. In the twelfth minute, Dongfang launched an attack, and Guo Yingqi broke through and scored a single-handedly, one to zero. After thirty minutes, Li Deqi scored two goals in two minutes, securing Dongfang's final qualification and sending Jiezhi away in frustration.</p>

<h3>After the Implementation of Flexible Adjustment of the Taiwan Dollar - Taiwan's Economy is Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Governor Yan Jiagan of the Provincial Government's Department of Finance, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the other day accompanied by Ma Shouhua, a member of the Taiwan Provincial Committee. Mr. Yan met with reporters from this newspaper yesterday and said: The main task of this trip is to discuss the price of fertilizers needed by Taiwan Province and the distribution technology issues with the Central Government. He will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days before going to Beijing.</p>
<p>He said: The ratio of the Taiwan dollar to the legal tender, since the implementation of flexible adjustment on January 13 this year, has been of great help to the overall economy of the province. The obvious signs: (1) General commodity prices tend to stabilize, that is, with the recent price fluctuations in the Shanghai market, 20-count yarn has risen from more than 30 million yuan to more than 60 million yuan. At the same time, the 20-count yarn in the province has only risen from more than 400,000 Taiwan dollars to more than 500,000 Taiwan dollars. (2) Bank deposits have generally increased by percent. The total deposits of the three commercial banks in Taiwan Province have increased to more than 8 billion yuan, which is more than 1 trillion yuan in legal tender.

(4) The mainland industry has increased its interest in investing in Taiwan's production business, and known items include the chemical industry.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked about the implementation of the system of leasing out public land in the province. He said: The province has been implementing this system one after another last year. For the lease of public land, tenant farmers only need to pay 25% of the rent under the normal harvest amount. In practice, it is even lower than the 25% rent reduction system implemented in the mainland. In order to reduce the burden on tenant farmers, improve the living conditions of tenant farmers, and improve production conditions. Since the provincial government implemented the system of leasing out public land, it has recently promoted the implementation of the 25% rent reduction system to private landlords, so that the rent of Taiwan Province can be generally reduced.</p>

<h3>Second Collection of Poems by Youren</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>By Yu Youren, published by Datong Bookstore</p>
<p>The old-style poems of revolutionaries can be roughly divided into two styles. One is to imitate the ancients as much as possible, with profound meanings and lingering emotions; the other is to use modern terminology, emanating from nature, and possessing a sense of the times. The former is exemplified by the poems of Zhang Binglin, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, and others. The latter is exemplified by the poems of Huang Xing, Ma Junwu, Xu Zhu, and others. This is what scholars of revolutionary figures know.</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Yu Youren's "Second Collection of Poems by Youren." His poems use modern terminology seamlessly and fully express a sense of the times and a sense of justice. In literary terms, it is purely revolutionary literature by revolutionaries, poetry born in the great era of the twentieth century. It is distinctly different from the works of some poets that could be placed in poetry collections from a hundred years ago or eight or nine hundred years ago, without easily distinguishing their era or author. In my memory, this seems to be the fourth time Mr. Yu's poetry collection has been printed, and the most comprehensive one was the "Annotations on the Poems of Youren" annotated by Wang Luyi. However, the majority of the works collected in this "Second Collection of Poems by Youren" belong to the period of the War of Resistance. He wrote them from the 22nd year to the 35th year of the Republic of China. Strictly speaking, our country had already begun the War of Resistance after September 18th. Therefore, this poetry collection can be said to be Mr. Yu's poetic history of the War of Resistance. Moreover, the majority of the poems in it are related to the War of Resistance. Therefore, the conclusion that it is a poetic history of the War of Resistance is most appropriate.</p>
<p>On his birthday in the 34th year, he wrote two seven-character quatrains, which say: "The wish to cultivate and herd the rivers and mountains remains unfulfilled; crossing the river to escape death becomes a chronicle. This year I happen to encounter Labor Day, and the artillery orphan has already turned white." "Born on a day filled with a hundred worries, the Zhongshan lineage cuts Ryukyu; the alliance rises to fight for all mankind, not just singing for Asia." This is none other than Mr. Yu's autobiography. Because when he was born, it was precisely when the Qing court was昏庸 and 朝政 was corrupt, and foreign troubles were pressing. Therefore, in his youth, he held great aspirations to cultivate and herd the rivers and mountains. Being an artillery orphan refers to the fact that his mother passed away not long after he was born, and he was raised by his aunt and lived with his maternal grandparents. He made paper artillery as a child, hence this poem.</p>
<p>The poem "Seeing Wounded Soldiers on the Huangpi Road at Dusk During Mid-Autumn Festival" contains not only compassion but also the spirit of rising up to kill the enemy. The poem says: "The wounded soldiers sigh and sigh again, the sun sets and the moon rises again. The crickets in the world love to admire the moon, but they do not know that enemy planes use the moon to wound our bones. The bright moon wanes, our bones ache; the bright moon fades, our bones are cold. The nation's life is fighting on a single thread, and we are fortunate to participate in the sacred war. Singing and dancing before the army celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival, but it is a pity that we cannot see it in shifts. Tonight the bright moon is round and round again, surely our army will break the barbarian sky. Break the barbarian sky, break the barbarian sky, our bodies are willing to be sacrificed for the country." In this, one can almost hear their voices.</p>
<p>The poems are also accompanied by lyrics and tunes. These works also possess the same sense of the times as the poems, with different tunes but the same skill. There are no narrow-minded or dry phrases. He created new styles of poetry, lyrics, and tunes to meet the needs of the times and provide a model for the literary world in an era of rising voices and contending schools. His broadness of mind and artistic conception, like the sincerity of skill manifested outwardly, can all be comprehended from his works. Now, let's take the lyrics he wrote in the tune of "Jin Lou Qu" in the 27th year of the Republic of China when his fellow villagers visited him and described the magnificence of his hometown and family mountains, and urged him to return north. The lyrics say: "Everything starts from scratch, with a few gray hairs, Master, a lifetime of lakes and seas, how many old friends remain? Bao E and Ying Liu, friends of Han Zhi, how many have become martyrs! To this day, who do we rely on in the wind and clouds? People say the homeland is truly magnificent, a good homeland, but it takes effort to manage. South and north, the situation is fraught with troubles. The great war of heaven and earth is unprecedented. Ashamed I was born at the foot of Mount 嵯峨, in the same village as Wei Gong. Not pursuing fame as a Confucian scholar or a general, I have something to ponder even in old age. I expect that in this world, you know what it is like! Hearing that three million have died in battle, I am even more willing for blood to stain the history of creation. Seeking a homeland, for freedom only." Public-spirited and selfless, his words are filled with a heroic spirit that soars to the heavens.</p>
<p>As for the tunes, let's take the one dedicated to the posthumous portrait of Zhang Taiyan as a representative. When Mr. Yu ran the Shanghai Shenzhou Daily, he was known as the "old master of Shenzhou." After the Min Yu Daily was closed by the Qing government, he went to Tokyo, and Zhang Taiyan said to him: "I am also an old master of Shenzhou, how can I not help you!" The tune is [Shuang Diao Bo Bu Duan] Ling, which says: "From Min Hu to Min Yu, we were both masters of Shenzhou in those years. Feigning old age and imprisonment was like acting a primary role, grieving for the times, throwing down the pen and weeping like a fisherman. At this time, does the teacher know?" According to the text, 本初 refers to Yuan Shikai, and a fisherman refers to Song Jiaoren.</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yu's poems, lyrics, and tunes, even though we have only tasted a small portion, we can infer the rest. It is the voice of the times, the writing of blood and spirit, fully expressing the author's personality.</p>
<p>There is one point in the book that seems debatable, which is that some of the works have annotations attached, using the third person, but it is not indicated who the annotations are from, which is a bit inappropriate. Because the book only states "Author: Yu Youren," it is hoped that the name of the annotator will be added in the reprint, so that the readers know.</p>
<h3>"New Treatise on Consciousness-Only"</h3>
<p>— Su Zhongxiang</p>
<p>By Xiong Shili, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>"New Treatise on Consciousness-Only" (新唯識論), written by Mr. Xiong Shili of Huanggang, existed in a classical Chinese version long before the war. I once read a thread-bound edition of the classical Chinese version printed on Lian Shi paper. During the war, Mr. Xiong himself and his disciples translated it into a vernacular version, which was published by the Commercial Press. In the classical Chinese version, Mr. Xiong said that he intended to divide his work into two parts: one was "Treatise on the Realm" (境論), discussing ontology, and the other was "Treatise on Measurement" (量論), discussing epistemology. The classical Chinese version of the New Treatise (abbreviated as 新論) was the "Treatise on the Realm" part, while the "Treatise on Measurement" had not yet been written. By the time the vernacular version was published, Mr. Xiong further stated that if the "Treatise on Measurement" was completed, it would be published as a separate book. Therefore, the New Treatise would no longer be called the "Treatise on the Realm."</p>
<p>This is a philosophical book with weight and value. It is intense, heavy, and serious. As the Western proverb says, "Style is the man." If this is true, then this painstaking work can give us a glimpse into Mr. Xiong's rigorous style of scholarship and personality. Mr. Xiong poured his lifelong learning into this book. After that, he mostly communicated with people through short, recorded sayings and rarely wrote formal treatises. This is a major gain for the Chinese intellectual world in recent decades. If we use Mr. Cao Juren's praise for Mr. Feng Youlan, this is also a great harvest for the Chinese intellectual world in nearly five hundred years. Therefore, its importance to Chinese scholars is self-evident. In recent years, the emergence of "New Neo-Confucianism" and this book are considered the two most noteworthy events in the Chinese philosophical world. What this book proclaims is far deeper and more intricate than Mr. Feng Youlan's New Neo-Confucianism in terms of its inner meaning and implications. However, the attention and discussion it has generated among Chinese scholars is only slightly less than that of New Neo-Confucianism. The great influence of this book can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into three volumes and nine chapters. The meaning is profound, comprehensive, and far-reaching, which cannot be elaborated in a short article. Generally speaking, it develops, corrects, and integrates the Great Yijing and the old Consciousness-Only school, taking the teacher's arguments and forging an entire theoretical system by making the ontological hypothesis of "constant transformation" (恒轉). Constant transformation has two functions: "contraction" (翕) and "expansion" (闢). Expansion gathers the mind, and contraction gathers objects. The myriad things in the universe are formed by this constant flow of momentary arising and ceasing caused by contraction and expansion: using the manifest substance and unifying substance with function, it is vigorous, strong, and renews itself daily, without end.</p>
<p>We do not make an evaluation of Mr. Xiong's book, but this does not mean that we acknowledge that this book is an impeccable truth. Frankly speaking, this book is the crystallization of Mr. Xiong's lifelong learning and painstaking effort. Its choice of words and creation of meaning all have specific purposes. We ask ourselves, we know too little about the Great Yijing and Consciousness-Only to make any comments. What we particularly express our joy in is that Mr. Xiong's efforts and style serve as a conscious symbol of a new stage in the Chinese intellectual world.</p>
<p>This meaning may not be fully expressed in a few words. I only intend to elaborate on this idea.</p>
<p>If I were to rashly divide it, I believe that Chinese thought in the last hundred years has gone through three stages. The first stage was from the late Qing Dynasty to the May Fourth Movement. The scholars of that time were mostly either attached to the internal while neglecting the external, or fundamentally ignored Western culture. Or they shouted "Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning for practical use." They still regarded Chinese culture as the mainstay. The second stage should be from the May Fourth Movement to around the September 18th Incident. At this time, the trend among scholars often concerned the internal while being attached to the external. They always advocated overthrowing all native culture and completely Westernizing. Mr. Feng Youlan gave a detailed explanation of these two situations when discussing the people of the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the scholars in these two periods had several shortcomings in their understanding of Chinese and Western cultures. That is, emotional, fragmented, and superficial. Because they valued emotion, they could not objectively examine the good and bad with reason and often mixed personal likes and dislikes. The slogan of throwing all thread-bound books into the outhouse is one example. Because it was fragmented, they always generalized from the particular and did not have a comprehensive view, let alone establish their own complete theory. People in the May Fourth era were accustomed to making comparative lists, such as saying: "Chinese culture is static, Western culture is dynamic; Chinese culture is moral, Western culture is scientific; Chinese culture is spiritual, Western culture is material... etc." (This kind of statement is still popular today). Regardless of whether these adjectives are appropriate or not, simply using a list of adjectives to clearly distinguish between Chinese and Western cultures is clearly messy and unproductive. Also, because it is superficial, they could not discern what the fundamental differences between Chinese and Western cultures were and why there were such differences. To sum it up in one sentence, they still did not have a fundamental, profound, and comprehensive view. These regrets gradually changed until the era of national crisis. Liang Shuming, Ma Yifu, Zhang Dongsun, Feng Youlan, and Mr. Xiong can be regarded as representatives of this third stage. These scholars generally have a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of Chinese and Western cultures, and they can come up with a set of theories of their own. Although there are gains and losses, this trend is valuable. And the "New Treatise" is one of the most brilliant examples. In this, one can see Mr. Xiong's understanding of logic, his personal, complete, and unique understanding of Western philosophy, one can see the crystallization of Mr. Xiong's calm thinking, and one can see Mr. Xiong's adoption of ancient Indian orthodox thought and Chinese orthodox thought, creating a complete and profound system. Regardless of the success or failure of the system, this book represents a symbol of the awakening of Chinese scholars, represents the characteristics of the third stage of modern Chinese thought, and is one of the most outstanding and successful representatives.</p>
<p>For such a serious Mr. Xiong, for such a scholar and his crystallization who is not moved by wealth, honor, and minor achievements, we would like to express our respect.</p>
<h3>Reading "Modern Chinese Grammar"</h3>
<p>— Pingxi</p>
<p>By Wang Li, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>This is a rare and good book. Apart from two or three other similar books that can be used as references, it is almost the only book worth recommending that discusses modern Chinese grammar at present. The nature of this book can be seen from its title. Generally speaking:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese: In the past, we have had many specialized books on the study of grammar, but although those books used the language of our own country as the object, the methods they adopted were purely Western. Some books since "Ma's Grammar" (馬氏文通), such as those by Zhang Shizhao and others, and those used in general schools, almost all copied some ready-made Western grammatical principles, classifications, and tabular solutions. This book is Chinese in nature. It never tries to imitate Western grammar in a far-fetched way, and more of it is completely creative. Therefore, it is very consistent with real Chinese.</p>
<p>(2) Modern: Some Chinese grammarians in the past often ignored the factor of the times and failed to grasp the linguistic characteristics of each era from the history of linguistics. Therefore, they often lumped together some ancient materials, from the Four Books and Five Classics to unofficial histories and novels, as research materials. As a result, there were many contradictions and, at the same time, they were out of touch with the living modern language. That is certainly not a reasonable study. In this book, the author tries his best to take the existing language as the object. Therefore, it is most practical, and readers will not misunderstand the era or confuse the ancient with the present.</p>
<p>(3) Grammar: The divergence between language and writing is more acute in China than in the West. Even today, after the success of the New Literature Movement, the distance between language and writing is still far. Generally speaking, grammar refers to the grammar of vernacular Chinese other than classical Chinese, but in this book, it has a narrower meaning. The author's basic requirement is that it is limited to spoken language. Spoken language has some things that can only be said and cannot be written, so it is not exactly vernacular Chinese. Why study the rules of spoken language? Presumably, it is because the text is moving towards this direction day by day, demanding to be alive.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese grammar, it has always been a blank page. There are some specialized books like elementary schools in ancient times, but at most they only study function words, such as works like "Interpretations of Words in Classics and Commentaries" (經傳釋詞). Later, Ma Jianzhong's "Grammar" (文通) was epoch-making, but in fact, it only picked up Western grammatical dogmas and could not truly explain the movement laws of Chinese literary (linguistic) grammar. In addition, some people think that Chinese writing or Chinese language cannot be explained by rules because it seems too chaotic, too illusory, or too different from Western grammar. Then, due to the efforts of many down-to-earth workers, Chinese grammar has a dawn of foundation. Among the new researchers of literary grammar, Mr. Wang Li is a scholar with the same authority as Mr. Lu Shuxiang. This book will undoubtedly lay down undeniable principles in some aspects. However, compared with other grammar books, it also has its own characteristics. These characteristics can be roughly divided into:</p>
<p>(1) It takes a single sentence as a research entity as a whole, and does not first divide it into characters, words, and then discuss sentences. This is one of the peculiarities of Chinese characters. On the one hand, each Chinese character has only a fixed shape and does not have any changes. On the other hand, it is because Chinese characters have too many functional changes, and they must be observed embedded in a fixed sentence.</p>
<p>(2) It automatically creates new terms to apply, and only uses Western grammar terms in some less important or general places. This can avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble. For example, regarding nouns, other grammar books still cannot forget the constraints of "gender," "number," "case," etc., which are omitted in this book. In addition, it does not use diagrams to illustrate much.</p>
<p>(3) It starts lively from the standpoint of utility. Researchers of Chinese grammar can be roughly divided into two schools. One school takes form as the route, which is the oldest school. The other school examines the character of a character or word from the meaning of the text or language. The author of this book seems to investigate from another point of view, taking the utility of text and language as the warp and weft everywhere. Therefore, it is also the most practical.</p>
<p>This book is divided into two volumes, with more than 600 pages and nearly 300,000 words. It is more troublesome to introduce the content, and at the same time, the space does not allow it. Some of the original ideas and essence of this book have been mentioned in Mr. Zhu Muqing's long preface before the book, so I will not elaborate on it. Roughly speaking, this book is divided into six chapters in addition to the introduction of ten pages, which talks about what is a language, what is Chinese grammar, and what is modern Chinese grammar. Chapter 1, "Sentence Construction (Part 1)," lists the units of text, such as characters, words, word classes, word types, idioms, and sentences, and then talks about the form of sentences. The author divides them into narrative sentences, descriptive sentences, and judgmental sentences, which are very consistent with the nature of Chinese language. The next chapter is the continuation of the previous chapter, listing various sentence patterns and giving detailed reviews. It also expresses many things that people have not yet expressed. Chapter 3 is "Grammatical Components," which is aimed at "Understanding Components." All those that are removed are some nouns, numerals, adjectives, verbs, etc. that make people understand the content. All adverbs, pronouns, copulas, conjunctions, interjections, and "marks" that only make the tone of the sentence exist are discussed. Chapter 4, "Substitution Method and Numbering Method," is the most brilliant, discussing every pronoun and numeral used daily, and pointing out how to apply them. "Special Forms" are some exceptions in Chinese grammar, especially unrelated to Western grammar, so a separate Chapter 5 is set up. Chapter 6, which is also the last chapter, discusses "Europeanized Grammar," pointing out how Chinese characters are changing their nature under the promotion of intellectuals, how language is changing, and how it is merging with world languages. Generally speaking, each chapter and each section is very complete, and each is attached with definitions, exercises, error corrections, notes, and comparative grammar for the practical use of schools or personal self-study.</p>
<p>However, this book also has its shortcomings. The most important thing is the improper use of cited materials, because although "Dream of the Red Chamber" and other books are written in standard language, they are always records of the linguistic forms of a hundred years ago, which are not realistic enough. In the discussion of Europeanization, it is also a mistake not to quote sentences from translated books. Secondly, it does not thoroughly study dialects and does not take into account the colloquialisms of ordinary non-intellectuals and workers and peasants. It seems that the atmosphere of "writing" exceeds that of "speech." Furthermore, some classifications are too cumbersome and cannot be combined more essentially. Finally, the author ignores some special languages that people say, such as the rules of dialects and proverbs, which makes the book unable to feel more complete.</p>
<p>In addition to this book, the same author has another book, "Chinese Grammar Theory," which is biased towards theory, not as this book is biased towards rules. It is more profound and more fundamental. Unfortunately, it has not been published to this day, otherwise, it can somewhat supplement the lack of elaboration on the principles of this book.</p>
<h3>Criticism of "Tao Yuanming's Critique"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingchun</p>
<p>By Xiao Wangqing, published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Like many lovers of classical poetry, I enjoy Tao poetry and criticism of Tao poetry. Any work related to Tao poetry, I make sure to visit the library within my travel capabilities; any books and periodicals I can afford, I make sure to purchase.</p>
<p>Recently, after reading Mr. Xiao Wangqing's "Tao Yuanming's Critique," I wanted to say a few words.</p>
<p>From Liang Xiaotong to the present, there have been hundreds of critics of Tao poetry. Not to mention the distant past, since returning to China, the following works in this area may as well be counted from Mr. Liang Qichao: (1) "Liang Qichao's Tao Yuanming" (First edition by Commercial Press in 1923). (2) "Tao Yuanming Special Issue," eight to twelve issues, a total of five issues (1926, Guoxue Yuebao [National Studies Monthly]). (3) "Ding Fubao's Annotations on Tao Yuanming's Poetry" (First edition by Medical Bookstore in 1927), including Zhou Yunqing and Xiao Tong's "Annotations on Tao Yuanming's Biography." (4) "Chuan Donghua's Selected Annotations of Tao Yuanming's Poetry" (First edition by Commercial Press in 1927), including "Chuan's Revised Chronology of Tao Yuanming." (5) "Zai Zhaoming's Jottings on Reading Tao" (1943, Gujin Zazhi [Ancient and Modern Magazine]. During the enemy-occupied period, someone was asked to copy and send it, but the issue number was not specified. (6) "Zhou Zuoren's Small Notes on Tao Collection" (See "Bitter Mouth, Sweet Mouth," first edition by Taiping Bookstore in 1944). (7) "Chen Yinque's On the Relationship between Tao Yuanming's Thought and Pure Conversation" (Full text not seen). (8) "Zhang Mingchun's On the Origin of Tao Yuanming's Thought in Zhuang Zhou" (June 25, 1946, Wen Shi Zhoukan [Literature and History Weekly], Central Daily News). "Examination of Misprinted Characters in Tao Collection" (June 1, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Supplementary Annotations to Tao Collection" (June 18, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). (9) "Guo Yintian's Tao Ji's Economic Life" (September 10, 1946, Su Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Social Life" (1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Soul" (October 16, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Achievements in Poetry Art" (October 17, 1946, Yangyang, Central Daily News). "Tao Qian's Outlook on Life and Society" (Cultural Vanguard, Volume 6, Issue 19). (10) "Zhu Guangqian's Tao Yuanming" (October 13, 1946, Literary and Art Weekly, Dagong Bao, Issues 1 and 2). (11) "Kong Yang's Tao Yuanming and Wine" (January 8, 1947, Yangyang, Central Daily News). (12) "Jiang Shuliang's My View of Tao Yuanming" (March 16, 1947, Literary and Art Weekly, Dagong Bao, Issue 23). (13) "Xu Chengyu's Talking About Idle Feelings Fu" (May 12, 1947, Literature and History Weekly, Central Daily News, Issue 40). (14) "Chu Wanfeng's Preface to Supplementary Annotations on Tao Yuanming's Shujiu Shi [Poem Describing Wine]" (May 12, 1947, Literature and History Weekly, Central Daily News, Issue 41). (15) "Bao Guangbao's Examination of Tao Yuanming's Stringless Qin" (July 14, 1947, Literature and History Weekly, Central Daily News, Issue 50). (16) "Guo Moruo's Notes on Painting" (Searching for Past and Present Pu Jian, first edition by Haiyan Bookstore in July 1947. (This is a special discussion on Qu Yuan and Tao Yuanming.) (17) "Xiao Wangqing's Tao Yuanming's Critique" (Kaiming edition, July 1947).</p>
<p>Among these, the more systematic and insightful works, in my opinion, should also be considered Mr. Xiao Wangqing's work. Perhaps works of criticism and textual research are similar in nature to dictionaries and encyclopedias, the later the more perfect? We might as well say that the work of studying Tao Yuanming, up to Mr. Xiao, seems to have reached a stage where it can be concluded.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao's strength lies in not blindly following others and unconditionally praising all of Tao's poems, especially the four-character poems. Before reading his chapter "On Tao Yuanming's Four-Character Poems," I was very worried, fearing that he would criticize "Ting Yun" [Stopping Clouds] and "Gui Niao" [Returning Birds], which I have always considered to have reached the pinnacle of art, as being worthless. There are nine four-character poems in Tao's poetry, and he pointed out the flaws in seven of them. It seems that he uniquely reserved "Ting Yun" and "Gui Niao" for me, which he also considered to be the most subtle and perfect poems. My appreciation has been tested once in disguise.</p>
<p>"Ting Yun" and "Gui Niao" will be like two eternally fresh apples, forever secreting fragrance!</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao's interpretation of "Gui Niao" truly grasps the poet's soul and seeks out the poet's mental activity when creating. This is arguably the most brilliant part of the book.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao has hardly any criticism of Tao Yuanming's articles. From the perspective of his book title "Tao Yuanming Criticism," this is not comprehensive. Because Tao Yuanming's articles occupy a non-negligible position in the Tao collection. Looking at any selection of classical Chinese prose, Tao's articles have the most chances of being selected. This is a universally recognized fact that does not need statistical figures to prove. His articles, though few, have many styles, including travelogues, rhapsodies, biographies, letters, elegies, and self-eulogies. It seems that he intentionally left us one or two model works for each genre. With Mr. Xiao's cultivation, he should have a good discussion on this aspect.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao said, "The research on Tao Yuanming had an outline in the Song Dynasty." This is correct. "During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there was no new development." This is only partially correct. In fact, since Zhong Rong, almost every literati with a collection of poems and articles passed down to posterity has always loved to mention Tao Yuanming. Gui Youguang of the Ming Dynasty called "Yuanming a person of ancient times who was good at dealing with poverty." Wei Bozi of the Qing Dynasty once lamented, "Later generations learn Tao, not learning his person but learning his poetry. How can Tao Gong's poetry be learned by learning his poetry?" These discussions are all good materials for supplementing anecdotes about Tao Yuanming's poetry.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao also said, "At this time, no materials about this aspect can be found in the Yuan Dynasty." It should be known that we can find a lot in Yuan Yishan's collection. And there is a special quatrain on Tao Yuanming: "Everything is naturally fresh and eternally new, luxury is exhausted to see true purity, the northern window is brighter than the emperor Yi, it does not harm Yuanming as a Jin person." What I have proposed is not important, but it proves that the Ming and Qing Dynasties did have information about Tao that we do not know. Also, as far as I know, in Chen Tingzhuo's Bai Yuzhai Ci Hua [White Rain Cottage Ci Talks], Wang Guowei's Renjian Ci Hua [Human Words on Ci], Lu Xun's Complete Works, and Wu Mi's Kong Xuan Shi Hua [Empty Pavilion Poetry Talks], there are very insightful fragments on Tao.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao's discussion of Tao Yuanming's thoughts is very pertinent. I admire this passage of his very much: "...He accepted the Confucian spirit of being strict with oneself and taking responsibility for hard work, admired the Lao-Zhuang realm of purity, tranquility, and nature (but did not fall into decadent mysticism), and also touched upon the Buddhist concepts of emptiness, compassion, and sympathy. Strangely, he also incorporated the spirit of knight-errantry." (Page 22 of the original book) The only regret is that Mr. Xiao elaborated less on the greatness of Yuanming's spirit. ""This is also a son of man, and should be treated well." ("Tao Yuanming's Biography"). "Landing as brothers, why must it be flesh and blood relatives." ("Miscellaneous Poems") If we can steal the remaining strands of this kind of universal love to be human, it must be more meaningful and valuable than merely "imitating Tao" in poetry.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao said that "Yuanming has poems of wandering immortals" (page 29 of the original book), and added a title mark next to the three characters of wandering immortals poems. It is acceptable to say that some of Yuanming's poems have the atmosphere of wandering immortals, but the Tao collection categorically has no special chapter of wandering immortals poems.</p>
<p>In short, this book of three chapters (Chapter 1: The Historical Image of Tao Yuanming. Chapter 2: On Tao Yuanming's Four-Character Poems. Chapter 3: The Art of Tao Yuanming's Five-Character Poems), forty pages, is worth reading. Not only are his insights valuable, but the articles are also full of poetic flavor.</p>
<h3>A Concise Table of National Administrative Divisions</h3>
<p>— Song Shi</p>
<p>(Edited by the Ministry of Interior, published by Commercial Press)</p>
<p>It is said that in a certain school's entrance examination, some candidates wrote that Shenyang is located in Shandong Province. High school graduates are still like this, let alone students below the secondary level? Even the general public is often confused about the national territory and administrative system. On the one hand, the country's own regional divisions are also changing: the increase in municipalities directly under the central government; the independence of Mongolia; the transformation of the Northeast from one province to nine provinces, and the territory of the nine provinces has also undergone changes; in addition to the capital, there is also a secondary capital. All of these make the general public's understanding of administrative divisions even more blurred.</p>
<p>The reason for this is nothing more than the lack of a correct and clear book on administrative divisions. The maps and books on the market are almost all pieced together by searching east and west. As a result, there are several different versions of the size of Nanjing City. What is the exact area of ​​the country? There are also no accurate statistics. The publication of the newly compiled "National Administrative Divisions" by the Ministry of Interior after returning to the capital can be said to be very timely. Although the content such as the area and population figures may not be very accurate, at least it is very necessary and important to correct the names of administrative divisions. At the same time, with such an outline as a foundation, future repairs and patching will at least be less laborious than the initial arduous work. Moreover, the original book also stated that "this book will be published once a year," so it can be revised and corrected at any time in the future.</p>
<p>This book divides the national administrative regions into three categories. The first category is municipalities directly under the central government, with a total of twelve cities (Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin). The second category is provinces, divided into thirty-five provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaoning, Andong, Liaobei, Jilin, Songjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, Nen'an, Nenjiang). It has jurisdiction over 2016 counties; 57 cities under provincial jurisdiction; 40 governance bureaus; 1 management bureau; and 209 administrative inspectorates. The third category is local, which refers to Tibet.</p>
<p>Among the three categories, the second category is of course the most important. Under the province item, there are seven columns: 1. County and city numbers. 2. County and city names. 3. Old names of counties and cities, including a brief evolution. 4. Area. 5. The ratio of the national area to the province's area. 6. Population. 7. Remarks. The evolution section also briefly describes the original names and their jurisdiction, tracing back to the end of the Qing Dynasty. This is quite convenient for research. For example, on page 11, Wu County, Jiangsu Province, has: "The former capital of Suzhou Prefecture, in the first year of the Republic of China, the prefecture was abolished and the county was retained, and the two counties of Changzhou and Yuanhe were merged. In April of the first year, the two Ting of Taihu and Jinghu were also merged..." In addition, several newly established counties also have very simple and useful explanations. For example, Lihuang County in Anhui Province on page 24 (commemorating General Wei Lihuang's military exploits), and Jingfu County in Henan Province on page 130 (commemorating General Liu Zhi's military exploits), etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the numerical aspects, although they are not absolutely accurate, they are still a yardstick when there are no accurate statistics at present.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, there is also an index. As long as you remember the first character of the province, county, and city names, you can check the page number listed in the book according to the stroke count of the radical in the index. The printing and paper are satisfactory. However, in order to make this book more valuable and practical, the author has a few suggestions to ask the Ministry of Interior to adopt, namely (1) In terms of text, strive for popularization, so that ordinary people can understand it and become a common sense book that Chinese people should have. (2) It is best to attach a set of detailed maps to the book, to complement this book and increase the Chinese people's concept of the national territory. (3) The arrangement should be simplified a little to reduce the burden on readers.</p>

<h3>A New Interpretation of Forgiveness</h3>
<p>— Feng Rixin</p>
<p>Confucius' lifelong philosophical foundation, according to Zengzi, is the two characters "loyalty and forgiveness," but the character "loyalty" has no specific explanation. The sentence in the Analects "The Master's way is loyalty and forgiveness, and nothing more" is followed by "What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others," which actually only explains the character "forgiveness," and the character "loyalty" is left empty. So, the most reliable annotation of Confucius' way is only the two sentences "What you do not wish."</p>
<p>However, recently I feel that these two sentences have problems. For example, today someone invites me to dinner. I am addicted to cigarettes, but the host is a comrade who quit smoking, or does not smoke at all and hates smoking. So, I have not been able to smoke (if I happen to forget to bring cigarettes). Isn't this suffering the loss of the host doing to me what he does not wish to be done to him? When it comes to eating, wine is inevitable. Even if the guests do not drink, the host will force them to drink, as if not getting the guests completely drunk is not a sign of respect. If it were possible to be so generous and polite about power, position, and wealth, that would be great, but unfortunately this can only be seen between the cups and tables, which really makes people suspect that the three hundred rituals and three thousand etiquettes of China are all about eating, drinking, dressing, and wearing, and have nothing to do with important matters.</p>
<p>Let's say that the wine is offered to you, and you encounter a stubborn host (I have seen people offering wine swear to guests: "If you don't drink this cup, I am a bastard," which shows how serious the problem is). Can you not sacrifice your own stomach to answer the host's kindness? According to this estimation, is the host being forgiving to the guest, or not? Someone in an article once complained about guessing games. When other people's spittle stars are flying around and fists are flying at your nose, if you are not one of them, where would you have time to appreciate the cries of "eight horses" and "nine connected lamps"? I am afraid that you would be more worried about the fish in the pond being affected by the fight. Then there is a difference in the view of wine. If it is good, then the loser should not be punished to drink, but the winner should drink freely; if it is not good, why give harmful things to guests? And force people to drink?</p>
<p>Here, forgiveness can be divided into two aspects: passive and active. "What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others" is passive, and "What you wish for yourself, do to others" is active. Passive forgiveness is certainly acceptable, but active forgiveness is very questionable. Zengzi only said "do not wish" and "do not do," but did not say "if you want to establish yourself, establish others, if you want to succeed, help others succeed." Or have the ancient sages already seen this? Passive forgiveness is inward-condensing, like an intransitive verb in grammar, whose action does not affect others—even its ultimate goal is not to interfere with others. The so-called not hindering the freedom of others is true freedom, which is an old tune, but it has a great truth. As for the active transitive style, we really dare not compliment it. Even the best and most reasonable things are not necessarily welcomed. For example, persuading prodigal sons not to smoke opium and not to indulge in prostitution and gambling often provokes rebuttals. And this time, the Shanghai Municipal Government banned dancing, which caused the glass and equipment of the Social Bureau to suffer greatly. All of these are examples.</p>
<p>However, the more advanced the culture, the more work belongs to active forgiveness, just as we cannot escape between heaven and earth once we are born into this world. The most deadly thing in this is of course the so-called advertising and propaganda. Not only do they deceive and confuse you in words and language, or increase your troubles, but they are also nagging and tireless in their methods. For example, the radio in the streets and neighbors has long been considered the most deadly thing. No matter which corner of the city you are in, you will encounter these troublesome opponents, and they will break in without opening the door or window, and preach to you, the stubborn stone that does not nod!</p>
<p>I often think that if human beings in the world completely eliminated the boundaries and organizations of race and country, there would be some major changes in moral concepts. Patriotic people in the past might become sinners of Datong [Great Harmony]. The reason is that their further interference is obviously 100% unreasonable from the perspective of pure freedom. Of course, this anarchist ideal is still too far from the real world, but if we are truly rational, we must admit that this realm will one day be realized. By that day, true forgiveness may come.</p>
<p>Recently, the major disease in politics is too much corruption. From my point of view, although most people are trapped in injustice due to the current difficult environment, it is also true that many people are misled by this kind of active forgiveness. For example, giving gifts during the New Year or openly bribing is completely based on the bribers' view of "who doesn't love money" to measure people's hearts. Lower-level officials are also like this to higher-level officials. On the one hand, they attack psychological weaknesses, and on the other hand, everyone gets into muddy water, so you don't have to be "untainted in the mud." Therefore, if forgiveness is universally implemented, it will definitely lead to a mess. The words of the saints must also be "viewed separately."</p>
<h3>Claiming Credit</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>A newly appointed police officer was eager to make some contributions and actually encountered an opportunity. It turned out that when he was on patrol, he encountered a robbery. He immediately reported to the police station by phone: "A man was robbed by another group of people, and I have caught one of them."</p>
<p>"Who is the person you arrested?" the police station asked him.</p>
<p>The answer on the phone was: "It's the man who was robbed."</p>
<h3>Father and Black Cat</h3>
<p>— Bin Ru</p>
<p>I miss my father very much, because he passed away when I was eight years old. The biggest impression he gave me was only once: he was sleeping on a rattan couch, with a pale and thin face, and a five or six-inch-long beard under his chin. He stroked the black cat lying on his stomach with one hand, and played with his beard with the other, saying:</p>
<p>"Xiao Ying! Bounce the ball."</p>
<p>Xiao Ying was my nickname, so I bounced the ball. But after only three or four bounces, the ball lost control and jumped under the rattan couch. I bumped my head and fell beside the couch. My father laughed heartily and helped me up, holding my head and saying:</p>
<p>"Bouncing three times is already very good. Does it hurt?"</p>
<p>I was seven years old that year, and the next year, my father died.</p>
<p>After my father died, I especially liked that black cat, because I only remembered that it often slept on my father's body.</p>
<p>When I was ten years old, I was taken to Beijing by relatives to study for ten months. When I was eleven years old, I returned to my hometown. Even the black cat at home had died.</p>
<h3>Childlike Innocence</h3>
<p>— Tong Tuo</p>
<p>Three-year-old Frolara has a bad temper. She doesn't want to eat during the day, but her appetite is very good after her parents go to bed at night. As a result, the child wakes up her parents with sharp cries, forcing them to feed her in bed, making their lives extremely abnormal and distressed. They tried to ignore her, beat her, and explain to her, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Frolara seems to like her little sister very much. Although her father is not a psychologist, he specially prepared a toy room for her. This toy room has no roof, and it contains small furniture and a complete set of dolls representing a family—one representing the father, one the mother, one the girl, and one the little sister.</p>
<p>At first, she put all four toy dolls on the bed, then picked up her little sister and patted the dolls to sleep. Then, she put the girl between the father doll and the mother doll, showing a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>The result is still a kind of jealousy. The girl represents herself, being able to sleep with her parents, while putting her little sister to sleep in another place. Frolara vents her anger in another form, and the result is making a lot of noise at night and wanting to eat.</p>
<p>If parents can study how children play, they can know most of their personalities—secrets of fear, hatred, love, doubt, jealousy, etc. According to psychologists, games are a mirror of young children's lives. They express the stories of their own world, revealing what they think and feel about their family, other children, and especially themselves.</p>
<p>For example, there is a child named Joan, who is seven years old this year. She was given psychological treatment because she was unhappy and troubled. She is easily angered and has no appetite. The psychologist sent her into a game room, and she immediately painted many rough pictures. One of them shows a house with the door closed and a little girl standing outside the door. There is also a tree and a locomotive. The psychologist knew her distress and began to ask:</p>
<p>"I don't know who the girl in the picture is?"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"The child is too lonely, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Joan nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"I think her name is Joan!"</p>
<p>"Yes—and that is her mother's house," the child said. At the same time, the psychologist knew that his question had touched the right line, so he knew her whole story: Joan's father was transferred to work in another place, and because there was no accommodation, he could not bring his family with him. One day, the child heard her mother chatting with a neighbor: "If it weren't for the child, I would have gone with my husband a long time ago."</p>
<p>Therefore, Joan felt that she had been abandoned and lost her parents' love. She had no room to vent her resentment, so she became unhappy and sick. When her mother knew what was troubling Joan, Joan's difficulties gradually eased and her life became normal.</p>
<p>Therefore, psychologists believe that games are not only of diagnostic value, but also an effective therapy for treating children's psychological disorders.</p>
<h3>Old Wine Stains</h3>
<p>— Qian Lu</p>
<p>Recently, a cold wave came, and I felt very cold. For more than ten years, whenever it was cold, I would muddle-headedly put an old silk cotton robe on my body, but now it is so broken that I can no longer wear it. So, I searched the bottom of the box and found an old leather robe that had been forgotten for a long time. Although the Chen silk is like rotten grass, after some adjustments, it can barely cope with the situation. The wine stains on the front are still there, which are the symbols of the "Wuling Boy" era. More than ten years of life have been spent dealing with it, and there is no time to worry about clothes!</p>
<p>In the ten years of war, my family lost four people in a row due to the impact of prices. Medical expenses and funerals were fatal blows to my finances and spirit. In the past, I didn't have to worry about the seven things to start the day, but now it has become a problem, especially the tuition fees for two people, which are like a farmer looking up at the roof with a sigh, and there is no way to remedy it.</p>
<p>Since I was hit, I only felt cold, decadent, and not interested in life. My family advised me to continue to develop outwards, firstly to supplement the economy, and secondly to relieve my boredom. But I always felt that among relatives and friends, those who could maintain their old feelings had all been baptized by the "rise," and their situations were similar to mine. As for those who can be successful, I always feel that when they see me, they can't help but have a sense of the different past and present, and avoid me as if they are too slow. Therefore, I made up a crooked word, which is:</p>
<p>"People in troubled times add experience."</p>
<p>"The old business has been exhausted with the conquest!" Alas!</p>

<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Full of Doubt (87)</p>
<p>Zhongjie strode into the bathroom and, glancing at the closet, slammed the door shut, rattling the glass bricks in the wall. Qifan found his behavior irritating and forced a smile, "Are you looking for a thief?" Zhongjie said, "Heh! Thief! I'm looking for the one who stole the flower." As he spoke, he nodded at Qifan, plopped down on the sofa, stretched out his legs, and stared intently at Qifan's face. Qifan paused, "Looking for the one who stole the flower? I don't understand what you mean." Zhongjie asked, "Are you truly ignorant, or feigning ignorance?" Qifan shook her head again. Zhongjie said, "Qifan! Since we've known each other, I haven't mistreated you, have I? I've agreed to everything you've asked. Now, because of you, I've received a major demerit, almost losing my position. You should know that." Qifan said, "Yes, you haven't mistreated me, and you've complied with my wishes in everything. I'm very grateful. But you said you were going to lose your position. That's not my fault, because I was passive." These words were already extremely polite and patient for Qifan, but Zhongjie's expression immediately changed, and he slammed the tea table with his hand, "What! You were passive? Then, I'm the one who harmed you!" Qifan pursed her lips and smiled slightly. Zhongjie nodded, "Good! I love you, but you don't love me, is that right?" Qifan found this question difficult to answer and continued to smile slightly. Zhongjie said, "That's not a problem. I love you. Whether you love me or not, I don't care. You're mine now. I don't mind taking the blame for you. Now, come with me!" Qifan asked in surprise, "Where are you telling me to go?" Zhongjie said, "You don't need to worry about that. Wherever I tell you to go, you go." Qifan said, "That's impossible. I have no need to go with you." Zhongjie slammed the tea table, "Now I've got you! You're admitting it yourself. You don't care for me. You're deceiving me! You're secretly favoring a young pretty boy. Others told me, but I didn't believe it. Now you've said it yourself!" Qifan was furious at Zhongjie's accusation of favoring a young pretty boy, and she trembled, "Director Miao, what do you mean by that? Please explain yourself clearly."</p>
<h3>Talking About Contradictions</h3>
<p>— Yungong</p>
<p>Despite the existence of logic as a field of study in the world, and despite people emphasizing "rational" thinking, contradictory phenomena are still frequently seen.</p>
<p>Some people suffer from not being able to wake up early. They specifically bought an alarm clock, hoping it would wake them up on time. But one wasn't enough, so they bought a second one. The reason was that after the first alarm woke them up, they could still linger in bed, taking a nap until the second alarm rang. Their intention seemed to be to wake up early, but they also wanted to sleep a little longer, a little better. This is an example that we can easily understand.</p>
<p>Or, suppose you are a social worker and you go out in the morning without rain gear and it starts to rain. You want to hire a rickshaw from the racecourse to the Bund on Nanjing Road, a short distance, but the rickshaw driver charges you 50,000 yuan. From a compassionate standpoint, you can forgive him as a special case, but based on human nature, you tend to become disgusted with all rickshaw drivers. That's how contradictory the human heart is.</p>
<p>Indeed, examples of contradictions are everywhere. A friend told me that a legitimate businessman going abroad inevitably has incomplete documents and goes through a lot of trouble, while a spy's certificate of origin, nationality certificate, and passport may all be complete! Furthermore, one day I passed the 16th Pier by tram and saw a sign hanging outside a warehouse door that said, "No unauthorized personnel allowed," but the door was wide open, and there was a person who looked like an "unauthorized person" in tattered clothes, loitering there.</p>
<p>Probably as long as the world exists, contradictions will exist, and they will never be eliminated. Young people often yearn for lovers who are "impossible to be together." Airplanes and artillery are originally used for war, but the best strategy is to achieve a "victory without bloodshed" by "winning without fighting." A husband would rather abandon his virtuous wife and be fooled by a "pretty face" of a bad woman... This string of examples is endless, but this article must stop here.</p>
<h3>Vicissitudes of Changdian</h3>
<p>— Qingxue Academy</p>
<p>Within the Culture City, there is a Culture Street, and within the Culture Street, there is a Culture Market. For half a month before the Lunar New Year every year, there is the so-called "Changdian Fair." The rise and fall, prosperity and decline of this fair reflect the changes of the times.</p>
<p>"Culture City" is Beijing, the ancient old capital, a political center for hundreds of years, where people seeking fame and fortune gather like "mountains rushing to Jingmen." The imperial examinations confined scholars from more than twenty provinces, and all related literature and art flowed here, becoming a cultural center. From the end of the Qing Dynasty when the imperial examinations were abolished, to the establishment of the Republic of China, the political form has changed many times, but in terms of culture, the old traditions are deep-rooted, and there are also many new developments. Even after the capital moved south to Nanjing in the seventeenth year of the Republic, and Beijing lost its political leadership position and the market gradually declined, the prestigious Peking University, the birthplace of the New Culture Movement, still existed. Moreover, the density of national, private, and major and minor schools far exceeded that of other cities in the north and south. Therefore, Nanjing was the political center, Shanghai was the economic center, and Beijing was the cultural center, forming a three-legged balance, which is generally accurate.</p>
<p>"Culture Street" is Liulichang, located south of the big city, west of Zhengyangmen, and east of Xuanwumen, and just at the Hepingmen opened in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China. Xinhua Street outside Hepingmen runs from north to south, and Liulichang is more than a mile long from east to west, forming a cross intersection with Xinhua Street. This place also has a quaint name called "Haiwang Village," with historical traces from two or three dynasties, which does not need to be described in detail in this article. Since the Republic of China, the streets have been widened, the city appearance has been improved, and a "Haiwang Village Park" has been built on the east side of the cross street, which is much larger than before in form. The shops on this street are lined up, mostly bookstores, calligraphy and painting shops, antique shops, brush shops, ink shops, and stationery stores. Most of the shopkeepers and clerks can talk about literature, textual research, epigraphy, and editions, and they talk about it with great interest. In the past, elegant officials, gentry, celebrities, and scholars lingered here, which was a good thing. There are many shops selling cultural goods, books, and paintings in various streets of the nine cities, with Liulichang as the representative. The prices of goods are also more expensive than those in the inner city shops. In addition to the old-fashioned bookstores, major Shanghai bookstores such as "Commercial Press," "China Bookstore," and "Yu Zheng" (the Yu Zheng branch closed seven years ago) are all located on the west side of the cross street, facing each other. Therefore, it is also a meeting and concentration place for the north and south book industries. In the past imperial examination era, it occupied an absolute advantage. Later, schools flourished, and it also maintained contact with the education sector. It is not an exaggeration to call it "Culture Street."</p>
<p>"Culture Market" is the Vulcan Temple north of Laitou Road on Culture Street. Although the temple base is not large, the architecture is quite clean and tidy, with three courtyards inside and outside. The front and back courtyards each have a main hall and side rooms with corridors, and the last layer is all north rooms. Each courtyard also has alleys that can be connected. The temple is opened on the evening of the fourth day of the first lunar month every year, and the fifth to seventh days are the official days for the Vulcan incense offering. At the same time, jade shops, ivory shops, red goods shops, and various antique shops of gold, stone, porcelain, and copper from all cities come there to rent rooms or set up stalls and display their goods, all using exquisite "treasure shelves," full of jewels and strange lights. The merchants and shop assistants who greet the guests are all neatly dressed and calm, and they can also speak a few foreign words. The customers are prominent officials, wealthy gentry, wives, concubines, young ladies, young mistresses, "foreign masters," and "foreign ladies." They are unwilling to stroll around the street fair but prefer to go to the temple with carriages and servants because they have money, so the business is particularly generous. There is a public notice of "Culture Market" outside the door, but it can actually be called "Aristocratic Market."</p>
<p>The business of this temple was in its "golden age" from the second or third year of the Republic of China to the eighth or ninth year. Because after the revolution, the former Qing nobles and prominent officials either lost their jobs or moved to Tianjin and Qingdao, and a large number of treasures from their residences were sold off and collected by antique dealers. In the early Republic of China, wealthy warlords and wealthy capitalists imitated elegance and collected antiques for display. Foreign masters and Madams from foreign firms in Dongjiaominxiang also loved Chinese curios, buying them themselves and sending them back to their countries in large quantities. As a result, every January, the cars at the east gate of Changdian were like clouds, crowding the street so tightly that even wind and rain could not pass through. Merchants' wealth flowed in, not only was the decline of the old capital in the past twenty years unbearable to look back on, but even in the former Qing Dynasty there was no such special prosperity.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, "The roaring one will be cut off, and the blazing one will be extinguished." Prosperity leads to decline, which is also a common principle. Since the tenth year of the Republic, large loans have long been exhausted, valuable and good things have been bought up, and wealthy customers have become fewer. In the seventeenth year, the capital moved to Jinling, and Chinese and foreign dignitaries and elegant people flocked south. The old capital's industries declined year by year, especially "Culture Street," and even more so since the Japanese invasion.</p>
<p>The Vulcan Temple is also called the "East Temple" because it is east of the cross street, while the Land Temple facing Haiyu Village on the west side of the street is the "West Temple." The East Temple mainly deals in precious jewels and jade, with calligraphy and painting as secondary; the West Temple mainly deals in books and inscriptions, with other antiques as auxiliary. The East Temple's biggest business is with "foreign firms," followed by wealthy and rich people. During the occupation, Westerners left in large numbers, and many short Japanese came, but the Japanese were known for being "stingy." Moreover, during the war, they focused on practical materials, and antiques were really "out of stock." Therefore, in these eight years, the number of stalls in the East Temple decreased day by day, and only two or three out of ten made money. On the Chinese side, the pseudo-"finance ministers" (surnamed Wang) had money and were really willing to spend it, playing with and collecting everything, especially chicken blood stones, Tian Huang stones, and famous seals. They bought with no regard for price, and selected only the best. Merchants regarded them as gods of wealth. In addition, "Wang Huzi," "Wang Xiazi," and "Wang Haizi" (all leaders of the pseudo-committees) also had their own preferences, but compared to the thousands of wealthy families of the old aristocracy, they were at the end of their rope. Only three or five merchants made "pseudo" fortunes, while the rest mostly closed down or changed careers. Since the victory, in terms of foreign firms, all merchants have been eagerly looking forward to "Big Old America," but the "Old Americans" who came to Beijing after the war were mostly soldiers with limited money. In the past year, they have been transferred away from Beijing, so how many foreign customers are left? In the entire Changdian, they are truly as rare as morning stars. Many important Chinese figures are busy with military affairs, and North China is now "surrounded by enemies on all sides." Food and daily necessities have risen in price, and most floating capital is focused on real needs, so precious goods have naturally been affected. The Vulcan Temple is even more filled with endless desolation!</p>
<p>The "West Temple" (Land Temple) was full of book stalls like a forest more than a decade ago, piled up like mountains, but now not a single stall can be seen, it is empty. Only a few are scattered outside the temple, leaning against the street wall. Eight or nine out of ten old bookstores in Liulichang are closed. Thread-bound rare books are mostly sold by the pound as waste paper for papermaking materials, so what else is there to say! Although the government has made a good deed of allocating huge sums of money to buy old books and preserve culture, this is not a "relief" issue that can be solved in a short time, so the old book industry is always pessimistic.</p>
<p>Social Services, Reader Consultations, Legal Clarifications</p>
<h3>Holding Ten Thousand Shares, Similar to Waste Paper, Business Downturn, Declared Liquidation, Small Shareholders Suffer from Company Liquidation</h3>
<p>Fan Yun asked: I previously acquired 10,000 shares of a certain company from a friend. The directors of the company are all financial tycoons in Shanghai. Recently, when I went to transfer the shares, I was refused. They claimed the company was about to dissolve and there was no need to transfer the shares. They would return the share money or exchange them for shares of the Kunshan Electric Factory owned by the company. I asked to exchange for the electric factory shares. One month later, when I went again, they returned the original shares, saying that the electric factory shares had already been exchanged by a major shareholder. They asked me to wait until the liquidation was completed and the share money would be returned. Half a month later, when I went again, the place had been transferred to someone else and I don't know where they moved. Now I have several questions and would be grateful if you could answer them: (1) Is it legal for the company to dissolve and liquidate without the approval of a shareholders' meeting? (2) Does the company have the right to dispose of company assets (such as all stocks, offices, etc.)? (3) Do major shareholders have any priority rights? (4) Can shareholders sue for embezzlement in court based on the company's deliberate delays? (5) If other shareholders file a lawsuit together, who should be the target? (6) Can I entrust a friend to represent me since I am currently out of town?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] (1) If the company has legally obtained the status of a company under the Company Law, its dissolution and liquidation should be approved by a shareholders' meeting. (2) The person in charge of the company has the right to dispose of all company assets during liquidation. (3) Major shareholders do not have priority rights. (4) You should first take the shares to demand payment. Otherwise, you can pursue compensation in court. If embezzlement is discovered, you can also file a criminal lawsuit. (5) The person in charge of the company is the target. (6) You can entrust a friend to handle it.</p>

<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A, Answered by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</h3>
<p>(Wang Jinlong of Maigen Road asks) What is a special telegram? What are its types and characteristics?</p>
<p>(Answer) Special telegrams are special uses of telegram services, divided into various types of telegrams such as verification, distribution, special delivery, forwarding, delivery in person, retransmission, prepaid reply fee, and notification of delivery. "Verification telegram": If the sender wants to ensure the accuracy of the telegram sent, they can ask the telecommunications bureau to retransmit the telegram for verification. "Distribution telegram": This is applicable if the sender wants to request the telecommunications bureau to distribute the telegram to more than two residences at the same destination. "Special delivery telegram": If the recipient lives outside the delivery area of the receiving telegraph office and the sender wants the telegram to reach its destination quickly, they can ask the receiving office to send a special messenger to deliver it. "Forwarding telegram": If the sender is afraid that the recipient may have left or has no fixed address when the telegram arrives at its destination, they can request to send a forwarding telegram. "Held for arrival telegram": If the sender is afraid that the recipient has not yet arrived at the receiving telegraph office or has left when the telegram arrives at its destination, the sender can have the telegram temporarily held at the receiving telegraph office or post office, waiting for the recipient to pick it up. "Personal Delivery Telegram": The telegram sent by the sender is to be opened by the recipient in person. "Redirected Telegram": If the recipient knows that a telegram will be sent, they can ask the local telecommunications bureau to redirect the telegram sent to them from all parties to the new address they provide. "Prepaid reply fee": If the sender wants the recipient to immediately send a reply telegram, they can prepay the reply fee first. "Notification of delivery": This is applicable when the sender requests to be notified after the telegram has been successfully delivered.</p>
