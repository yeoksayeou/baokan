<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕美對華政策協會理事長柯爾伯日前抵京訪問，定十七日赴滬返美。柯氏十六日接見記者，評論美國對華關係稱：「過去美人對華靜觀政策之貽誤，不久之將來將付其代價矣」。柯氏於評述世界各地之共產黨稱：「無論在美國·捷克·巴拿馬運河或中國之共產然，美人已同樣視為美國之仇敵」。柯氏稱，美對華政策協會會長魯斯夫人，認爲美國務院遠東司「受左派及同情共產主義者之控制，此種情勢必須予以澄淸，俾形成一明確之對華政策」。柯氏繼作解釋稱，往昔美國會所以對援華事保持緘默者，蓋在避免刺激大衆情緒。目前美政府方面建議經濟援華，國會方面則屬意同時畀予中國經濟及軍事之援助。柯氏認爲將來兩者可能部分實現。柯氏强調稱，如共和黨於本屆大選中獲勝，則美國援華之舉可能更趨積極。關於共和黨之政策，最近已由共和黨領袖紐約州長杜威正式予以宣佈。共和黨其他有力人物，如共和黨衆議院領袖馬丁，參議員塔虎脫，參議院外委會主席范登堡等，均係同情軍事援華者。是以共和黨一旦於大選中勝利，則大規模之援華方案付諸實施，乃意料中事云。</p>

<p>稅法有關人民負担　各委發言激烈辯論</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立院十六日晨例會，通過所得稅，印花稅，貨物稅三種稅法及卅七年度所得稅起征額及稅率表。此項稅法，以事門人民負担，各委員於討論時，紛就稅類，稅率及稅額各主要項目發言，就中以貨物稅法之爭執最爲激烈，在塲各委員發言者達三分之二，印花稅法修正之處最少。</p>
<p>所得稅法全文共一百六十三條，宣讀即佔一小時半之時間，首先引起波瀾者，爲第三條中第二類所得，小學敎員薪資免予繳納之規定，王毓祥提出修正謂，小學敎員旣規定免稅，大學中學敎員生活亦極淸苦，故應一律免納，陳顧遠，劉不同，劉克僑，陳長蘅，孫九錄等均反對修正案，認爲本法爲經常法，大中敎員生活淸苦爲非常現象，現起征點甚髙，對彼等影響甚少，王之修正案黨予否決。第四條管制事業所得稅，規定爲百分之五至百分之廿五全額　進稅率，王毓祥，孫九錄，陳海澄，楊肇熉等認爲過低，應提髙至百分之五至百分之四十。張肇元，陳顧遠，陳長蘅等則顯及稅率太高，資本易於逃避。張肇元，說明美國稅率髙達百分之九十者，然其其他條件均可使此項稅率易於實行。王毓祥否認稅率髙使資本逃避，渠認爲逃避主因爲社會不安定。最後表決通過劉不同之折衷建議，修正爲百分之五至百分之卅。第一五七條在文字上略有修正，即行全部通過。起征額及稅率表亦略有修正：（一）第一類營利事業所得稅稅率第十項，修正爲「所得額在五百億元以上未滿一千億元者，課稅百分之廿五」。第十一項修正爲：「所得額在一千億元以上者，一律課稅百份之卅」。（二）綜合所得稅寬减額第二項，修正爲「敎育寬减額每人一千萬元」（請參閱昨日本報第一版）。</p>
<p>印花稅法全文共卅二條，宣讀時略去稅率表，以節時間，主要之修正僅爲條文中之「司法機關」一律改爲法院。</p>
<p>討論貨物稅法時，爲時已晏，遂僅宣讀修正之條文，第三條征收貨物稅之貨物及第四條稅率，均引起甚久之爭辯。劉志平首爲北方人民請命，謂麥粉有稅而食米無稅，實屬不平，應予取銷。主張麥粉征稅之陳長蘅允减少一半，仍不能獲得劉志平之同意，最後表決，以多數通過，原定「麥粉，凡機製麥粉均屬之」一項予以取銷，稅率所規定之從價征收百分之二點五，亦連帶取銷。討諭稅率時，　爾康認爲有的稅率過髙，有的過低，陳長蘅，劉克僑，程元斟，劉志平，劉通等紛紛發言，爭執之要點爲：化粧品，錫箔及迷信用紙應予提髙。水泥，糖應予减低。最後孫兼院長主持，逐一提出討論，結果仍維持原案，貨物稅法全文十七條，遂吿修正通過。</p>
<p>國防部組織法草案送回政院重行擬訂</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕政院提出之國防部組織法，已在立法院中被否決，原法決定送還政院重行擬定，再送院審議，其理由爲所擬組織法草案，與六項立法原則全行遠背。該案前經立院軍事委會會同法制委會審查，即提出上項意見，十六日立院例會討論時，全塲一片反對之聲，威主照審査意見，送回政院重擬。彭醇士·王侵等就組織法與立法原則精神相悖之處大加發揮，謂：原定之立法原則爲：（一）以軍屬政，（二）權能劃分，（三）陸海空軍一元化，（四）權責分層，（五）參照世界各國最進步之國防制度，（六）適合國情，然組織法之精神，適與此六者相反。王俊且指出，所謂海陸空軍一元化，實乃一人化。各國國防制度，無一個將軍訓·軍令·軍政屬於一個機關者，而我國國防部長外，另有參謀總長，部長不大於總長，不小於總長，亦不等於總長，總畏不小於部長，不大於部長，亦不等於部長，此即適合國情。陳長蘅從財政方面着眼，謂，審計部不能過問軍務費，而每年預算軍務費佔十分之七八乃至十分之八九，如此審計部即可不要了，由國防部包辦。預算兵員，呈報時即是六百萬，試間打仗時有多少？劉志平甚至謂：如此組織法，旣不美觀，也不英雄，不妨登在報上，讓大家看看。最後決定照審査意見通過，送回政府依據立法原則重行擬定，再送院審議。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>關於配糧</h3>
<p>— 陳岱孫</p>
<p>五大都市的糧食全面配售的舉辦，據官方宣稱：京滬兩地已於三月開始，平津穗三市則定於四月開始，實行配售的最初四個月定爲試辦時期，惟政府將努力使此制度成爲管制糧食來源的永久辦法。這是政府對於糧食配售制度第一次的嘗試。本計劃的擬議是導因於美國對華救濟物資的協定。根據中美救濟協定第二條已項，中國政府「在環境許可之中國大都市，應創行配售及物價管理制度，以求確保各階層人民，不間其購買力如何，均應獲得自國外輸入或由當地所產救濟物資之公平分配量」。因爲根據此協定所供應的美糧，不足做全面配售，決定的辦法是，在此試辦期內，半數配售量取之於美方供應，其餘半數則由糧食部及五市政府供給。試辦限於四個月也因爲山美救濟協定所供的美糧只　做這個短時間配售之用。</p>
<p>如果配售只限於美糧，配售的對象只限某階層人民，配售的用意應是救濟或津貼。然而現在是全而配售——雖然在試辦期內，只有五都市的市民配售的對象——並且政府於美糧之外，還負責供應半數配售量。可見本辦法是要借美糧做一個基礎，實行配售，以平抑糧價安定民生爲目的。我們對於本辦法的評價，與其將來成效，也應以這目的爲標準。</p>
<p>定量配購確是控制物價辦法一個重要的配售制度。固然我們不要誤會以爲只要有定量配購制度，物價就平抑住了。物價上漲有種種條件，條件存在，即使有配購制度，物價仍然要漲。但若在執行控制物價各項指施時，沒有定量配購　與之配合，這個制度就有漏洞，平價的結果便受影響。</p>
<p>本辦法如果以平價爲目的，則（一）所謂配售者必切實行定量配購，而（二）政府對於全部糧食的供給必須有有效的控制。</p>
<p>所謂切實實行定量配購，是指每人每月全部購買糧食量，不論來源，有個定址。定量以每人應有消費量爲準。定量配購制的主要用處是在有限制消費者—尤其是有錢消費者。在自由市塲中，消費者只要有錢，便可以所有的錢競購物品。消費者加劇競購，是加强漲風的原因。在定量配購制下，每人所買的總量有個限制，有錢並不能隨意競購。社會上，一部分的購買力便受了凍結，而不能在市塲中變爲對物品的有效需求。然而一般人民生活上最低的需求，都可以得到平等的滿足。本辦法側重於美國所供應的糧食，與糧食部與各市政府所負責供應的糧食的分配。這兩項來源所分配給每市每月的總量，實際少於各市每月必需的消費量。以北平爲例，北平人口以一百七十萬計，假定大口每月麵粉三十斤小口十五斤，每月需九十七萬袋，而糧食分配會議決議配售定量，不分年齡性別，一律每月配售十五斤，共合五十八萬袋，如果政府所配售者只限於美國供應，與糧部同市府負責供給兩項糧食所構成的官糧，人民於每口十五斤外的需要仍須仰給於自由市塲。再若官糧的購買有定量，而自由市中買賣仍無限制，則本辦法便不是切實實行定量配購制，因爲人民的總購量仍然沒有限制。定量配購制的功效也不會產生。故爲切實實行定量配購制，每個市民，每月的總購量必須規定。如果採用憑證配購的辦法，每大口每月總購量規定為三十斤小口為十五斤，則每證除可買官糧每月每口十五斤外，尚可以在普遍市場購足其差額。當然市政府也可以負責供應所有市民全部糧食的需要。（如此則普通市場使根本取消）官糧配售也就是定量配購。然而這進一步的辦法不是必需的。</p>
<p>定量配購的另一方面，就是政府對於物品的供給必需有效的控制。糧食定量配購制度所需要的糧食控制不是必須取消普通市塲，以官糧供應全部的配購。如果政府必須購買全部配糧的糧量，方算是有效控制。雖然配購制只限於五都市，所需要的本錢實爲可觀。其實所謂有效控制者只是指（一）疏暢糧源，使市外食糧能經常的源源而來：（二）取締囤積居奇：（三）杜絕黑市，使購糧者，必須憑證購買，且不得超過定量，以免有配額，而缺少可配之糧，有可配之糧，而爲投機者所操縱。事實上，現政府在推行本辦法的時候，已經有大量官糧在握，所憑藉者已經甚爲優越。在握的官糧自是完全控制。旣然控制一部分的供給，問題就是如何控制所需的差額。上面所講幾點，一方面是行政技術問題：另一方面，是執法問題。而後者價較爲重要。如果政府對於官僚，豪門，及特殊人物的非法行爲，不能制裁：則投機，囤積，黑市依然存在，有效控制糧食供給又何從作到？。</p>
<p>還有一個問題便是糧價。本辦法規定配售價等於市價百分之九十五，隨市價漲落。有人懷疑，旣然是官糧，何以官價不能大低於市價，使小民得些實惠：官價又何必隨着市價漲落？這問題就在於配售的用意了。若配售的用意是救濟或津貼，低價有其理田，低價就是等於送禮。送禮未嘗不可以，只看應送不應送；只要應救濟，應津貼，則政府願意以糧食送總的辦法達此目的，亦何嘗不可。不過如果是救濟或津貼，低價何如無價。無價至少有一個好處，就是救濟或津貼的性質因之面顯著。再若最救濟，應當只有貧民受益，不應貧富一律受救濟，若爲津貼，則必需受津貼者有工作或職務上應受津貼的理由。以五都市市民這單層資格，沒有要救濟或津貼的理由。所以本辦法的用意如果是救濟或津貼，全面配售便不合理。旣然是全面配售便不應是救濟，津貼。然而若官糧隨市價漂落，則與平抑市價於何有？本來定量配購每有一個限價政策與以配合。本辦法實賦缺如。我們認爲這是表示厘定本辦法者顧盧現實的態度。定量配購，對於平價的功效，在於限制消費，以减少社會的有效需求。加果通貨膨脹進行甚微，其他方面的措施——如取締囤積，投機，黑市等等——相當有效，消費的削减也許可以抵消通貨膨脹的影響。然若通貨膨脹突飛猛進，消費削减的力量，相形之下，小得太多，市價一定要繼續上漲。現在的情形就是如此。我們猜想厘定配售辦法的人認為在今日通貨劇漲情形之下，無論採取任何步驟，此後糧價仍是要漲。果有限價，限價恐亦必需隨市價調整，則限價等於具文。只有一個希望，就是政府旣然絕對把握的一部分糧食，剩餘部分糧食供給可以居奇的成分與力量因之大為減少。如果政府能藉此機會，對於供應這一部分糧食的普通市場，嚴加管制，努力杜絕囤積，與黑市，則配售辦法實行之後，雖然，隨一般物價上漲的糧食自然漲價，仍是不可避免，而人為因素所做成的暴漲或可因之而消滅。對於平抑糧價的工作，未嘗不有點小補。</p>

<p>亞洲分會地址不固定</p>
<p>日韓將來可列爲會員</p>
<p>〔中央社碧瑤十六日合衆電〕爲時四週之聯合國糧農組織會議，已吿閉幕。該組織亞洲辦事處地址問題，迄未確定。經表決结果，多數代表贊成辦事處地址每兩年一換，由九個亞洲會員國間輪流充爲辦事處地址。另外會中主要建議案計爲：（一）設立印度洋太平洋漁業委會；（二）國際合作協同設法提髙亞洲各國營養水準；（三）設成立國際食米委會；（四）設立遠東食米調査委會；（五）推行保藏食米運動。</p>

<h3>義未來總統　似非尼古拉莫屬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十五日電〕此間政治觀察家今日預料，四月十八日選出之議會，將選舉現任臨時總統尼古拉爲義首任正式總統，惟尼氏現年六十九歲，身弱多病，早有倦勤之意，如果當選，亦必堅辭，俾得退休。尼氏原爲一胆小之議會主義信徒，大公無私，各黨人士多樂與之交，以是生平無一政敵。故欲另行物色一總統候選人能爲各黨所接受，頗爲不易，在此情勢之下，各黨或將一致請其勉爲其難。</p>

<h3>滬津界電呈院部　請緩辦特種刑庭　認為創此畸形審判影響憲政前途</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕特種刑事法庭已吿成立，將自下月起開始受理案件，本市律師公會認爲在立院未經通過草案前，應予緩辦，昨特分別具呈南京司法院·立法院ˉ行政院ˉ司法行政部ˉ國民參政會略謂：「昨據上海各報紀載，特種刑事法庭已於本月十一日成立，即日開始辦公，本會逖聽之餘，無任惶駭。誠以特種刑事法庭之組織法草案，現尙在立院審査階段，而該特種法庭竟在草案並未通過以前，先吿成立，實開中外司法史上未有之惡例，况當行憲之年，首創畸形審判之制，重爲割裂漸歸完整之法樅，竊期期以爲不可。又按該法庭組織條例草案，所擬適用之法律，最髙本刑爲死刑及無期徒刑，一審終結，不能上訴，關係於人民之基本權利者，至大且鉅，倘以未合法院組織之特種法庭，從事畸形審判，將使道路側目，民怨益深，憲政前途，有不堪設想者矣。本會心所謂危，難安織默，敢貢一得之愚，電達鈞院（部），懇再愼重考慮，並即會商有關院部，飭將特種刑事法庭在未經立院正式通過草案之前，暫行緩辦，以重憲章，而宏法治。」</p>
<h3>要求開車不耐久候　榮軍包圍北站　站長等被歐傷　各次列車誤點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東北各戰塲受傷榮軍一千零七十名，昨日趁招商局海張輪，由津來滬，其中二百九十七名派至丹陽後方醫院療養，七百七十三名派至蘇州後方醫院。聯勤總部於下午一時許派員赴路局軍述辦公處接治車輛，洽定臨時增開「衛生列車」一列，載運車傷榮軍，餘者另撥專車四輛，擬增掛於今晨四時四十分開行之五十二次車上。嗣傷兵因嫌開行時間過遲，經改掛於昨晚五時四十五分之五十八次車。</p>
<p>傷兵旋又要求再加專車兩輛及茶水車一輛，經輾轉交涉，費時已久，且因車輛一再接卸，頗費週折，而天時己黑，列車仍未能開出，車中傷兵不耐，一再派代表向站長催促開車。車站當局因限於行車秩序與調度規章，未能隨便允准，因此發生誤會。八時四十分，數百榮軍一擁包圍站長室，一時秩序大亂，値班站長等走避一空。旅客見形勢嚴重，亦競走避，車塲站長呂秀，首先被毆受傷，總站長室站役王榮林及電燈匠，驗車，車號司事等五人亦被毆受傷。迨至九時正，總站長劉世中聞訊趕到，與軍運辦公庭劉科長等竭力勸導，並保證立即開車，始免事熊擴大。但在該次列車開出以前三小時內，因糾紛延未解決，北站各次來往列車，一律被阻。京滬綫下行各車均停真如站等候，滬杭綫上行車咸滯於徐家匯站與西站間，第二十六次，八十次，四十三次，五十六次，七次，二十二次（西湖號）十五次，七十九次等八列車，或遲到或遲開，各誤點一二小時不等。</p>

<h3>旅美名攝影師籌備自費拍片　黃宗霑挾彩色膠片抵滬　物色「駱駝祥子」主配角　希望藉此介紹我國固有文化道德</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕旅居好萊塢以善攝香艷女星馳名全球最近由美返國之我國名攝影師黄宗霑，昨午後乘機由港抵滬。黄近在等自資創辦汎美影片公司，自任總裁，其第一部影片擬拍攝老舍名作「駱駝祥十」，劇本已以美金一萬五千元延聘好萊塢名劇作家萊佛改編中，不久即可脫稿。黄氏此來即爲在祖國物色演員，兼在港·穗·滬·平等地搜集材料，作攝片之初步準備。黄氏在滬稍事逗留，十八日即將赴平。據謂「駱駝祥十」決全部以國人充任主配角，劇中對白則用英語，外傳該片女主角已內定在滬某明星担任說，黄氏昨特予否認。</p>
<p>黄氏繼稱，服務好萊塢影壞已乘廿餘年，私衷輒引爲憾事者，即各國影片在美上映，俱能轟動一時，獨我國影片始終不能上映於美國各首輪彤院。渠此次決心以中國作品，中國演員攝製影片，一方面固希望藉該片介紹我國固有文化道德及同胞實際生活情形於美方人士之前，同時亦盼能乘此機會，爲我國造就若干男女演員，將來儘量在美予以拍片機會，冀其在藝術上與英美明星爭一日短長，而嶄露頭角於國際影壇之上。渠此次去平擬勾留兩週，離美時帶來彩色膠片甚多，赴平後將擇各處優美風景，大量拍攝，將來經由滬港馬尼刺返美，途次亦仍擬儘量搜集外景，以供抵好萊塢後研究何者堪作片中背景之用。至於該片將來在國內拍攝時，道具將由美運來，拍成後再赴美洗印整理。該片之叙述·攝製·光綫·結構·渠決本廿餘年來攝片經驗，以純中國式之手法處理，摒棄好萊塢一般慣用之所謂「噓頭」，期該片攝成後能成爲一幅幽靜之中國古畫，使我固有之藝術精神，得以充分發揮且將來在國際間亦能得廣泛之宣揚。</p>
<p>男女主角　想條件</p>
<p>「駱駝祥子」在美銷路極侄，目前已發行五百萬册，足證美方人士對該書極感興趣，此片如攝製完成，定可轟動一時。汎美公司此次決以五十萬美元拍攝該片，將來如塲面浩大，或將再予增資。至黄氏在華擬覓取之適當演員，最重要之主角有三：一即爲祥子，其理想條件爲十九歲至廿九歲之男性，身長五尺十一寸，體重一六〇磅左右，面型無需俊美，祗要淸秀，誠實，善良，充滿智慧，而又拙於辭令。另一爲虎妞，需一十九歲至二十歲之少女，天眞，　　，而富於恬靜之美者·此外尙需一三十歲至三十一歲身材適中之女主角，玲瓏俏俐，而　需似書中人之可憎面目者。</p>
<p>五歲出國未除迷信</p>
<p>黄宗霑體格堅實，酷似拳繫家，發言沉靜異常，無好萊塢一般名流所特有之浮囂。渠對「美」之觀點，修養極深，認識亦至爲深刻。黄爲粤台山人，五歲時隨父母經商去美，在華盛頓州帕斯科鎭讀中學兩年。自幼酷愛攝影，曾以賣報所得購「白朗尼」一只，為家人試攝，因「白朗尼」缺乏「取景框」攝成後片中人物自頸部以上竟吿缺如，家人習於迷信，横施責罵。嗣黄請以十元美金購一新機，再事研究，果大有進境。黄雖旅美多年，傳杭之迷信觀念猶存，昨在旅邸中與記者共吸捲烟時，猶不願以一根火柴燃爇三支烟捲。</p>
<p>女星常識　青雲直上</p>
<p>黄於一九一七年由同學之介，入好萊塢爲攝影師服役，自週薪十元開始，漸升爲跟隨提持攝影機之職。暇時　利用塲中燈光，以自備舊機練習拍攝明星人像、再零碎出售。某次偶爲名演員瑪麗明特拍照拍成後　往以五角美金求售，瑪麗一覽之下，驚爲奇蹟，謂成績之佳，鳳所未遘，當詢以有否把握在演出時拍攝，黄表示願加一試，瑪麗即固請導演，以後其主演各片，指定需由黄攝製，黄遂從此躍進影壇，一帆風順。以香艷著稱一時之明星如瓊克勞馥，海蒂拉瑪，葛認里亞史璜遜，安秀麗丹，瑪琳黛德麗，瑪特琳卡洛兒等競延黄攝片。渠等深信由黄攝製必能益增嫵媚，黄因此設成好萊塢中首席攝影師，而明星中亦多賴黄攝片後，經各方好評激賞後始吿成名者。</p>
<p>拍片一部　美金五萬</p>
<p>黄因經歷愈深，各明星之性情俱已熟稔，角度姿勢無須硏究，皆瞭如指掌，故鮮有改攝或重拍者。集現在美攝片之標準代價，爲每部美金五萬元，曾有人以一年工作四十二　，薪金十萬元之髙價延聘。渠認爲攝影者先須將人像拍好，始能攝製特寫鎖頭。渠認爲其過去最滿意之作品，爲金石盟，反攻緬甸，自由萬歲，勝利之歌，民族精神等片。至於在其乎中最具優美鐘頭之把握者，則有瓊克勞馥，海蒂拉瑪，安秀麗丹三人。</p>

<h3>實現人民政治　打倒貪官汚吏　中訓局同學對時局意見</h3>
<p>中央訓練團上海同學會上次紀念母團十週年紀念時，曾決定發表對時局之宣言，後又幾經開會硏究，草成該團上海同學對時局意見，倡導完成「戡亂動員綜合體系」，政治經濟社會各方面澈底配合戡亂動員，主張爲：（一）實現「人民之政治」，反對公文政治，政治必須與人民生活聯繫，自人民生活上求效能。（二）打倒官僚政治，貪官汚吏，豪門資本，建立眞正人民的民主攻治。（三）澈底調整中央人事，根絕地方自治中之封建勢力，達到淸的政治，還政予眞正的人民。（四）打倒財富集中，建立民生主義經濟制度。（五）將救濟特捐改爲財產稅，避免普）遍勸募，應由豪門富戶負担。（六）改造國民黨，恢復革命領導，及民主集中制等等。</p>
<h3>張湘紋待嫁　白髮締良緣</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕曾記得十五年前，熊鳳凰與毛彥文在慕爾堂結婚，紅顏白髮，佳耦天成，一時傳爲美談，上年中委李石曾與文學家林素珊結合，也是一段美滿姻綠。最近又有一對經過二十五年崇髙友誼而有情人終成眷屬的新夫婦出現。</p>
<p>這兩位，說起來讀者一定很熟稔，女方是海上名醫服務社會埀三十年的人和醫院兼尙賢醫院院長張湘紋，男方是中國警察界先進歷任首都警察廳長內政部高等警官學校浙江警官學校校長戰前會任厦門市長的王固磐氏。張院長今年五十二歲，過去數十年，只是埋頭苦幹爲產科造就人才，爲社會努力服務，提倡新醫藥，確有極大的貢獻，而從來不曾想到有組織新家庭的計劃。所以此番忽傳行將結婚的喜訊，她的親友與門生都覺得非常的驚奇；因爲這消息極爲神秘，雙方都諱莫如深，直至舊歷元宵那天，男女兩家曾請過一次客，纔透露了一點風聲。</p>
<p>王氏今年六十四歲，精袖飽滿，看起來還很年輕。抗戰期間，他在重慶祖任中央警校的校務委員及管理德義敵僑，深爲中央所器重，曾以歷年官俸所得，在歌樂山建了一個敎堂，宣揚敎義。據說還是出於張女士的主張。他倆都信奉基督敎，最初相識，是二十五年前在美國紐約市，當年張女士留學新大陸，王氏則代表我國出席世界警察會議，兩人一見如故，嗣後各奔前程，同爲社會國家盡其最大之努力，講到雙方友誼，正是崇高而誠篤。去年秋季，王氏喪偶，中饋乏人，因此才和張女士談論到嫁娶問題。</p>
<p>據張女士對人表示，結婚的本意，並不是兒女情長，而基於數十年深交，結爲未婦，免得雙方晚年的苦悶。有了新家庭，決不放棄手創的事業，相反地更將鼓勵勇往的精神，爲社會服務，爲民衆造福。至於他倆的吉日良辰，現在尙無確期，大約總在一兩月以後吧。（圖爲王氏與張女士近影）</p>
<p>非關兒女情長　免得晚年苦悶</p>
<h3>社會局長表示指數不能凍結　認為工業凋敝原因無關指數</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市工業協會前因生活指數增漲，所屬會員工廠多無法負担，經第十八次理監事聯席會譏決議，要求政府硬性規定本月份工資照上月份生活指數計算，以便計算成本。本市各業職工對工業協會此項建議甚爲注意，總工會並公開表示反對。昨據社會局長吳開先吿記者，渠迄未接獲工業協會之公事，對此一建議，渠認爲工業凋敝並非因指數問題而起，工廠生存在於貨品銷路，現因物價上漲人民購買力下降，致工廠製成品銷路呆滯。而生活指數之增漲係根據物價，若貿然凍結指數，則直接影響工人生活，間接亦影響社會治安。社會局對此一問題不擬請示中央，而準備逕行解決。得鄭重硏究，俾使勞資雙方均能維持現狀，而無顧此失彼之虞。</p>
<h3>辦理飛機登記旨僅在使得統計</h3>

<p>又該公司去年在美訂購之康伏爾—240型客機六架，本年六七月間可望陸續來滬。中央公司特派機航組技術員飛美，赴該機之製造廠實地硏究。首批赴美之人員，亦定十七日下午乘中國公司班機由滬飛舊金山，轉赴康　爾—240型機製造廠。將來該項新型機之來滬，即由中央公司之技術員及駕駛員親自駕駛來滬。</p>
<h3>徐匯定期改選區長</h3>
<p>徐匯區區長包大用副區長趙十雲呈准辭職，市府昨令該區，定二十五日召集區民代表會，改選正副區長，並限即日起至二十一日止，爲區長副區長候選人登記期。</p>
<h3>中紡第二印染廠股權持有人請願</h3>
<p>前中華染色整煉股份有限公司（即現在之中紡公司第二印染廠）全體股權持有人吳璋錫等百餘人，昨推代表分往市政府，警備部等各機關請願，指中紡公司强佔人民財產，並在廠內貼發標語宣言，警局誤會，曾拘去數人，旋即釋放。當晚吳等並假新生活俱樂部，招待新聞界，報吿詳情，並請同情援助。</p>

<h3>市長夫婦歸來　湖畔遊憇　腰痛全愈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長夫婦於本月九日向行政院乞假赴杭遊憇，業於昨日乘西湖號快車於晚七時三刻抵達西站。市長週來漫遊西子湖畔，鮑覽湖光山色，心曠神怡，腰痛業已痊愈，較離滬時略見豐腴據吳夫人吿記者，市長患眼疾（紅眼睛）迄未見愈。市長表示在杭州玩得很好，惜迎日春雨綿綿。市長夫人亦連嘆「遝氣不好」。</p>
<p>昨往西站迎迓者，有警察局長俞叔平，副局長張師，市府總務處長歐陽遒詮，人事處長鄭天牧等。市長之男女公子各二，亦均往迎候，一見吳夫人下朮齊趨前歡呼「媽媽」。後應本報記者之邀，在月台上攝下「合家歡」一影。</p>

<h3>工賑續辦四個月　經費二五〇億元　庇寒所改難民招待所</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市卅六年度冬令救濟會將於四月底辦理結束，社會局長吳開先及該局第四處長袁文彰，特於昨日下午邀集地政，工務，公用，警察，衛生各局代表，商討本市救濟工作於冬救會結束後如何繼續。經決定冬令救濟會結束後，工賬工作仍續辦四月，並成立上海市工賑委員會。現有各工賑庇寒所屆時均改爲工賑所，工賑難民擬自二千餘擴充至四千人。全部工賑所需經費工務局預算工料工具工資費共二五〇億，其餘主食費副食費尙未在內</p>
<p>昨日會中並討論現有之第一·第二·第三庇寒所，待冬救會結東後，所有收容難民簡化保釋手續，願返者予以遺散，庇寒所則改爲難民招待所，改隸社會局。</p>
<h3>連日天氣陰霾　週杪可望放晴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日天陰霾，且多豪雨，據氣象台報吿：此種氣候尙需持續二三天，本週杪始有放晴希望。西伯利亞反旋風現正向朝鮮中南部，日本本洲地域推進中，高氣壓中心現在蒙古與東九省邊界上空，太平洋暖流在東海黄海上空與高氣壓接觸，致造成此項氣候。昨日溫度：最低攝氏七度三（華氏四十五度二），最髙攝氏十一度七（華氏五十三度〇）。</p>

<h3>招商局登陸艇　營口歷險記　入匪掌·冒大砲火　負重傷·昂然歸來</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十二日航訊〕招商局中一〇五號登陸艇，於上月二十六日自葫蘆島載軍用品增援營口，二十七日到達營口港外，二十八日進港，為共匪所據，其後迭被共匪迫令駛赴大連，終因海面冰厚，未能駛往。三月一日被我空軍發現，其後該輪乃於猛烈砲火下冒險外逃，當其逃出時，轉舵器被炸毁，電路不通，前槍漏水，情况之惡劣，無以復加。三日經我永定艦發現，始護送往葫蘆島。七日由濟平號，拖帶駛塘沽，八時下午到達，船身傷痕斑斑，船員亦死傷多人，現已入塢修理，即仍重荷海運重任，茲據該輪發表歷險經過如次：</p>
<p>冰上停駛</p>
<p>本輪奉令由「北極一號」（按：此係新港破冰船，甫抵塘沽，即奉調葫蘆島祖任破冰）及趙課長會同汪連絡官指揮，在胡蘆島裝軍米五千包，汽油三十八桶，榨菜三百二十入　，食鹽三十七包，彈藥三十噸，在二月三十六日十三點四十五分離葫蘆島，開營口，由汪連絡官及押運員王，顏，劉三人，士兵九名，在破冰船「北極一號」領行下同往，二十七日到達營口港外，下錨。自離葫蘆島，即謀與營口電台連絡，但不得要領，十八點二十分接獲葫蘆島港口司令部電示：「速進營港」，二十八日夜半六時三分，起錨進港，十時因遼河冰厚，無法前進，（冰厚約六七尺）於四號岸標處慢車與北極號尾後附近保持接觸，趙課長及押運二人先行登陸，十三時三十分，發現右岸三浬之地，有二十餘番號不明軍隊荷槍監視，十四時後，又來番號不明大批軍隊，由趙課長等三人帶領前來，在船旁佈崗，本輪因其情形可疑，光令趙課長上本船，但不得要領，趙課長即上「北極」，十四時三十分，本船乘退潮倒車轉頭退出，再候命令，但同時砲聲四起，集中本輪射擎，經數分鐘之久，「北極」追過船頭，並由趙課長用無綫電話令立即停船，否則還要開砲，汪連絡官仍深信岸上我軍，因需糧情形迫切，致有此舉，乃令船上人員放心，强令本船停軍，遂擱在冰上，十四時五十分由顏押運員同「王師長」（共匪）領率部隊，經「北極」登船，由「王肺長」談話後，方知已成俘虜，船上電台，即被强制停止工作，同時並開始據奪本船公私各種物品，十七時開始卸米及彈藥。</p>
<p>迫駛大連</p>
<p>廿九日報務員盧家楨首先被押登岸，同時汪連絡官及押運員三人士兵九名，亦被押離船，十七時五十分，在被共匪監視下，由共匪領港駛離營口，經復州灣往大述，後因「北極」被冰所困，本船再返營口，繼續被迫卸米，三月一日十一時五十分，再度被迫離營口往大速，十三時四十分，因潮水不足，在營口外第三俘標拋錨，是時爲第一次被我軍飛機自空偵察，旋即飛去，同時本輪大副孫基博，因不堪共匪威脅，而神經失常，後再繼續航行，子夜時因海面冰厚，船身無法前進，便由「北極號」，令回航營口，二日八時四分，在營口又去卸米，十四時二十分受我軍飛機轟炸，大桅着彈被燬，後部着火，留駐共匪隊長因見濃烟四起，即下令全部共匪離船登陸，水手十一名，服務生兩名，及大副（因神經失常）亦隨共匪登陸，十四時三十分共匪去盡。</p>
<p>火中脫逃</p>
<p>當救火之際，船員見有機可乘，一方面設法滅火，一方面不顧共匪砲火密集射繫，以全速後退，當時轉舵器被炸傷，電路不通，失去效用，幸兩部主機，電燈機及迴旋羅盤尙未損傷，乃靠兩部主機前後操縱方向，不幸十五時廿五分因潮水不足，在港道第三浮標擱淺，十五時五十分，再度被我軍飛機轟炸，大艙中彈，汽油被焚機槍不停射擊，因之三管輪邱人驥，（浙江鎭海人，二十四歲）看艙陳玉唐，（湖北漢口人，二十六歲）服務生周實根，（浙江奉化人，三十三歲）水手馬寳華，（天津人，二十二歲）均因救火而被炸死，太匠王永發，洗衣匠何世福，服務生張瀛洲等三人，亦因救火受重傷，三副謝鳳澤，服務生陳楚洲二人，亦受輕傷？十七時四十分，因漲潮而脫險，在港道不熟，舵工水手全無，前艙漏水之惡劣情况下，幸全體餘生者抱與船共存亡之決心，以知其不可爲而爲之毅力，在全體合作精神下，整夜工作，最後卒吿脫離虎口。</p>
<p>海軍護送</p>
<p>三日四時五分，被永定　發現，因不明本船眞况，開砲射擊，廚房首先着彈，幸彈未爆發，未有死傷，否則結果亦不堪設想，當時全體員工以爲係共匪駕駛「北極」進來，心灰意冷，致有自殺之意，至六時一分發現永定艦燈號，全體員工始拍手稱　，再獲甦生。十一時五十分經海軍軍官二名登船檢査，及詢問眞象後，四日下午由永定艦保護，在濟平號拖輪拖駛下，五日帶到葫蘆島，七日上午六時，由濟平輪拖帶，開來塘沽，於八日下午二時五十分到達入塢修理。（本報記者李紹林）</p>

品。其中最重要的一章就是是「高爾基生活與作品槪觀」，按年分編傳記，引證原作和批許者的話。書中選附有高爾基作品出版年月和版本的詳表。　　還有一種是皮克沙諾夫（Nikolai　Piksanov）的「高爾基與國民文學」（Gorky　and　National　Literature），寫的是高爾基四十年來對於國民文學的券力和發展。皮克沙諾夫指出，蘇聯共有五十個單位，至少有十五個是有他們自己的文學的。那就是說，他們都有作者和出版機構。高爾基在革命以前對於居住在蘇聯的各國文學就已經極感興趣。早年他就出版各國的文選，最早的三種是阿美尼亞，拉特維亞和芬闌的，出版於二十世紀初年。高爾基計劃把蘇俄以東國家的作品譯成俄文，又把蘇俄和西歐各國的文學譯成蘇聯各國的文字。高爾基爲了這個機構，曾與各國作家往還，又曾聚會了好多次。高爾基希望蘇聯各國部能用他們自己的文字使得世界文學通俗化。他搜集各國的民俗，並加分類，也是極重要的。現在高爾基已經逝世十年，蘇聯聯在繼續他未完的遺志向前做起。　　還有一種是伊凡諾夫（Vsevolod　Ivanov）的「高爾基會見記」（Meetings　witli　Matim　Gorky），這是他對於這位大作家的回憶錄，在各個不同的時期下寫成的。第一篇「兒時」（In　Childhood）說到他兒時無力購買高爾基的著作，他的同　就慫恿他去偸。他好多晚上讀着這些書，極爲感動。他說；「甚至我不能說我非常喜歡這些故事，或者我們了解它們·但它們充滿了我們的心，帶有不可解釋的偉大呼喊，帶着不易形容的狂喜的，燃燒的，年靑的和金黄的熱情。當時我就知道作者是一個正直的人，他　求眞理，要想除去人類所忍受的一切憂傷，凄凉和煩惱」。作者與高爾基相識是在作者第一次文學成功以後。他曾經送過十篇短篇小說給高爾基，當時他一心只想求名。但高爾基的回信都希望他再多寫多讀，說他的小說實在太貧乏了。這時伊凡諾夫纔懂得他的日標不應該是名譽的微弱憐光，而應該是堅苦的工作與藝術，到藝術之路是漫長的，峻陡的，痛苦的，然而却也是甜蜜的。這纔開始工作。以後的文章都叙的是他們倆二十年來的相識與友誼。在這些文章裏顯出高爾基可愛，却又是啓發的；溫和，却又是年靑的蘇聯文学嚴肅的指導者，他每大都注意每一個作家的發展·最後一篇文章講到高爾基博物館，說起下面有趣的數字；從一八九七年到一九一七年，高爾基一共出了一百三十一部書，共印一百零八萬三千册，其中一萬一千册是國外的版本。從一九一七年到一九四六年，高爾基有一千零八十三種在蘇聯出版，共印四十二萬萬册，其中有五百三十萬册是在蘇聯他國所出版的。　　還有一種是「高爾基戲劇　書」中的四卷「論文與研究」（Papers　and　Researches），這是帮助上演高爾基戲劇的導演和演員的。其中一卷「愛戈·布勒契夫及其他」（Egor　Bulychev　and　others）有高爾基看過莫斯科伐克探戈夫劇院（Vakhtangov）此劇首次演出的意見。其餘三卷的書名是「杜斯替加耶夫及其他」（Dostigayev　and　others）「蘇莫夫及其他」（Somov　and　others）和「老人」（The　Old　Man），每冊約九十餘面。　　這四種講到高爾基生活及其著作的書，對象是各種不同的讀者羣，當然目的也各有不同，但都可以看出高爾基是怎樣努力地在那兒發展現代蘇聯各種文學。　　最後且談一談高爾基的郵票。一九三二年是高爾基文學活動四十週紀念，曾發行過兩種紀念郵票。一九九四三年三月，在衛國戰爭時，適爲高爾基七十五年生忌，發行了三十戈比和六十戈比的兩種郵票，其中一張背景是風浪和海燕，作爲高爾基詩的象徽·一九四六年高爾基逝世十周年紀念，又印行郵票二種，附插在文中的是三十戈比的。設計者是藝術家杜巴梭夫（Dubasov）</p>

<p>自由談冬日的扇子  吳庸　　量其才，某人宜做某事，而不做某事，「才不能盡其用」。量其才，某人不宜於做某事，而竟做某事，是謂「人不能稱其職」。宜做某事而不做，其故往往不在不欲，而是出於不得已。不宜於做某事而做之者，考其原因：或是無機緣做宜做之事，只好勉強云做不宜之事，是其一；或是大利所在，無暇計較宜不宜，悍然做之，是其二。　　玄玄先生前於本刋「知識者的困境」一文中舉例說：「筆者有一個朋友，本來是弄文藝的，近年來鑒於文藝之無出路，改行做單帮……還有一個寫文章的朋友，他的文章雖不見得驚天地而泣鬼神，但在一個文明社會里，這樣的作品是決不嫌其多的，可是他現在每天坐在證券號子里，凝視着行情板上的數字。」宜做的事不容做，而去做不宜做的事，是乃至可哀痛的。　　世有大才小用者，有小才大用者。大才小用，只是才不能盡其用，痛苦但及於個人，對社會言，只是一種反面的損失而已，其害尚小。小才大用，乃是人不能稱其職，本人或痛苦，或欣幸，對社會言，却難免產生正面的不利，其害則大。　　世有不稱其職的人，乃有不盡其用之才。二者不無關連。試以球賽爲例：李惠堂，足球健將也，然於馳騁球塲之際，亦須有其他稱職的隊　與之配合，李惠堂始克「得手應心」，展其所長，即所謂牡丹雖好，必須綠葉護持者是。如隊　輩不諳球藝，不懂「組織」，彼此不知合作，互相不能呼應，則李從巧，或亦將無所容身。　　孟子：「趙簡子使王良與嬖奚乘，終日而不獲一禽。嬖奚反命日：天下之賤工也。或以告王良，良曰：請復之。强而後可，一朝而獲十禽，嬖奚反命曰：天下之良工也。簡子曰：我使　與汝乘。謂王良，良不可，曰：吾爲之範我馳驅，終日不獲一；爲之詭遇，一朝而獲十。詩云：不失其馳，舍矢如破。我不貫與小人乘。請辭。」王良依照法度爲嬖奚駕車，而嬖奚不依法度射擊，致不獲一禽，再爲　奚駕車時，王良以不依法度之駕馳去湊合王良不依法度之射擊，乃一朝而獲十禽，於是博得嬖奚的一聲「良工也」。王良却說「不貫與小人乘」，提出了辭呈。辭了職做些什麼去呢？諒來也只好改行跑單帮了。　　人材貴　配合得當，而後才可獲得高度的效率，以前例言，駕駛者遵照法度，射擊者不守法度，或射擊者遵照法度，駕馳者不守法度，均不易產生良好的結果。倒不若不守法度的駕馳者與不守法度的射擊者搭配，反可一朝而獲十禽。以此推論，守法度的駕馳者若能與守法度的射擎者取得連擊，其所獲當有十倍於此者，此乃人材間最理想的配合。　　王充論衡：「夫能御驥騄者，必王良也；能臣禹稷畢陶者，必堯舜也。御百里之手，而調以千里之足，必有摧衡折軛之患。有接具臣之才，而以御大臣之知，必有閉心塞意之變。「亦强調人材須上下配合得當方能獲得最佳之效果之意。　　人與人間的才具何以不易獲得理想的和諧與配合呢？這使我　到社　一般的風氣問題。射擊不依法度的人們，其彼此間原也自成一系統，原也可謂之「和諧」，可謂之「配合得當」，此即「此亦一是非」。在這個集團中，如王良堅欲依據法度爲之駕馳，便顯得不調和，是謂「不合時宜」。所謂「人稱其職」，所調「才盡其用」，原只是一個抽象的標準。若以不依法度之射擊爲風尚，則駕馳者必須不依法度，始能爲世所用，爲慶奚輩褒之曰「稱職」。　　故王充說：「說者不在善，在所說者善之；才不待賢，在所事者賢之。馬圖之說無方，而野人說之；子貢之說有義，野人不聽。吹籟工爲善聲，周越王不喜，更爲野聲，越王大說。故爲善於不欲善之主，雖善不見愛；爲不善於欲得不善之主，雖不善不見憎。」時尚所趨，人們愛聽「野聲」，而你倡導什麼「淸徹」之音，不見愛而見憎尚是小事，弄得不好，不啻「以夏進　，以冬奏扇，爲所不欲得之事，獻所不欲聞之語，其不遇禍幸矣。「　　「夏進　」，「冬奏扇」，於理原有不合，其遭人們之厭惡也固宜；只怕明明已是冬天，你去進　，而人們要扇；明明巳是夏天，你去奏扇，而人們要爐；蓋是夏日生爐，冬日揮扇，已是成了一種風氣；於此塲合，有些人便不免被目爲「冬天里的扇子」。恐怕竟要遭投在爐里生火之危了。晋霖書籍  晉霖　　一部好的書，使讀者在開卷之前有期待的情緒，在掩卷以後有濃厚的回味。—愛爾各脫　　書是隨時在近旁的顧問，隨時都可以供給你所需要的智識，而且可以照我們的心意重複這顧問的次數。——美勃斯　　書是我們的教師，能够靜靜地教我們，但決不會發怒，也不需要麵包或金錢，如果我們接近它們，不會躱藏起來；如果我們是愚笨的，不會駡我們，如果我們是無知的，也決不會取笑我們。——地白利二月的青島  陳烟帆　　　　當我看到「化些間去旅行」那篇短文在自由談刋出的時候，正好在北洋綫的輪船裏，吳淞口開出很久了，海上面漸漸有了些白色的霧，汽笛不時的嘶呌着。　　離開上海以後，常常使我感覺一陣輕快。這以後有好幾天看不見報紙，沒有聽見，也沒有看見，得以暫時隔離了高物價的可怖的世界。陰天，海上有一片淡淡的白色的平明，船行走得很平很穩的，遠處的海面時時捲上來一些小浪花，像年輕姑娘的露齒一笑。有霧的夜裘，到甲板上去走走，茫茫的暗空和墨黑的大海之間籠着非明非暗的霧。船上的艙前的燈火都關熄着，僅露着兩邊的光。汽笛每隔一分鐘鳴鳴的呌了一聲，怕與遇到的船相撞。看不出時針，茫茫無際的行程。那種感覺是憂　與沉思的，彷彿象徴了這個時代。　　船到埠的時候，迷漫的烟雨正籠罩着靑島。去年春天我曾到這裏來過一次，沿山的精緻的洋樓，幽麗的風景，她是非常呌人留　的城市。可是無論她的外貌怎麼漂亮，現在是正面臨着嚴重的苦難。雨天的街市裏是非常的冷淸，三四個人力車夫和二個小販像烏鴉一般悄靜地縮在店家的屋簷下。下雨天，少有人乘人力車，百貨店也沒有人上門，連街角上的紙烟攤也少人問津。那邊通過鐡道的陽橋底下黑壓壓地擠着十來個短衣的人們，去聽聽他們站着在講些什麼呢？—大米四萬元一斤，大葱十八萬一斤，韮菜十二萬一斤……兵船粉二百廿五萬了！你說，多可怕的數字呀！　　當我們步行於傾斜的山坡似的街道上時，幾個窮苦的小孩子跟了上來，說着一些可憐的話。如果給了錢，則又來了一批。那些衣服襤褸的可憐的孩子緊緊的跟隨着我們，我的心靈也彷彿緊緊的受着壓迫。沒有別的可說，這些艱苦的年頭，人們的眼睛已經看不見美麗的山水了，也感不到和喛的風，聽不到可愛的聲音了。何况又是一連串的陰雨濕悶的日子。站在海邊勵志社盟軍招待站的亭子旁望出去，遙遠的海，環繞的山和靑島的全市，都在凄迷的灰暗的細雨裏。今日，如果你有機會到北方去旅行，那末將要看見許多的滲着血和淚的悲劇。也許，上海倒是比較好的地方。逍遙花  陳慎言　　第十二章　萍水姻緣（一〇〇）　　島雲通：我們就在北平給婚如何？」綺紈忙道：這個萬萬使不得，我決不能在北平結婚，你還不知道我的環境不允許我這樣辦嗎？「島雲稍一躊躇這：「我還有個主意，不過　　小姐稍爲委曲一點，我們何不宣告旅行結婚，等我們到上海或是到香港，我們再正式請客，這個辦法，你看怎麼樣？」綺紈道：「如此也好，不過我的意思，先到香港，再到上海。「島雲道：「按路程說，我們先到上海再到香港，才是順路呀，經過上海，我們不能不住幾天，反正我們是旅行給婚，巳經結婚了，一切親友就有什麼議論，也無所謂。顧小姐你看是不是？」綺紈覺得島雲所說的，不爲無理，便點點頭道：「如此也好。「島雲道：「現在我的病體，可以出院，顧小姐你在醫院裏，大槪還要住幾天？」綺紈道：「我本沒什麼病，只是不願意回去。」島雲道：「那末我們算淸住院費，就可以走了。」倚紈略一遲疑道：「不是那麼簡單，說走就走；我也得回去一趟，把我應帶的衣服略爲收拾收拾。」島雲道：「我等顧小姐把一切交代好了再走，只是……綺紈道：「只是什麼？「島雲道：「只是時間能縮短點更妙。」綺紈道：「這個當然，你暫時不必離開醫院，我把一切都交代好了，就通知你。」二人議定之後，當晚薄暮，綺紈悄悄回到家裏，吩咐小王媽，不許張揚出去，連夜把應帶的東西，很簡單的收拾兩提箱，寫一字條交給小王媽，呌他等明日晚上，給他哥哥肖鶴，告訴他到上海去。第二日一淸早，綺紈趕到醫院，會同島雲算淸住院費，一人趁火車到夭津。搭海輪到上海。在船上二人共同起臥，儼同夫婦，到得上海，島雲在中東飯店住下，綺紈一看島雲竟邀她住在這種旅館，心裏便不高興，見店內一切設備，都不算時代化，心裏暗忖，據島雲自己說：他在上海有房子，何以不到他家裘去，却住在旅館內？若是爲的新婚蜜月裏嫌自己住屋小，要在旅館暫住一時，以便請客等等，也未嘗不可，那也要住一所最華貴的旅館，方顯闊綽舒服，現在住在這種旅館，由他這一點看來，似乎不很大方。悼念家煌  李梨　　　　浙人彭家煌，會寫過九本小說；當他臨死前的一些時候，困居在上海，他和陳企霞同住在金神父路底靠近打浦橋的一條里衖裏，兩人合租着一個亭子間，生活窘得很。　　那時，我住在金神父路二百十七號，生活雖不寬裕，可是比他要好一點兒。　　當「無名文藝社」成立後，經常往來的人，是葉紫（余自强湖南人），汪雪湄（留法學生河南人），以及陳企霞（浙人）；而隱在背後，不很露面的，是彭家煌；所以，社刋「無名文藝」創刋上就有彭家煌的一篇描寫士兵生活的蛟成熟的小說；因爲是無名作家的期刋，所以家煌的作品並未署上眞姓名。　　社址在西門路逄萊里五號盛馬良家，那時我也住在那邊，以致同這幾個人接觸的機會很多。　　家煌有絡顯鬍子，皮色紫黑，像個粗野的農夫；可是筆下的作品，却很細緻可愛。　　後來他患胃病，進海格路紅十字醫院去動了手衛，經過不很良好，最後竟因而去世了。　　家煌遺下了三四本小說，不是無成就的作者；可是死得多麼凄凉；當時送殯的，祗有一卡車約二十多人。　　家煌死後，在抗戰期間，葉紫又死了，企霞和雪湄兩人也很久沒有看到他們的文字，不知近况如何？陳蒙庵又韓携酒見過因邀味逸同飮  陳蒙庵　　　　臨桂教授恒苦饑，日抹縑禇貿金貲，傳家淸況門如水，勞身力作甘如飴，乞米不書魯公帖，飽飯便和陶令詩，閑來過從嘗移晷，正言莊論雜詼譏。平生莫逆孰逾我，一日不見起相思，嚴冬長夜耽寂寞，叩門聞聲知何誰？闖然出見無他語，袖出長瓶兼尊罍。香醇味釅藏之久，其謀諸婦需不時。洗盞大呌覓肴核，嗟咄頗難辦珍奇，良宵旨酒忍輕負，羶葷盤饌徒爾爲，更邀佳客共此興，街南蔡子來施施。氳氤酒氣淸且冽，雅譚時復一中之，醺醺不覺顏爲赤，相喩無言契其微，天寒地凍尚劇戲，人間信有吾輩痴，嗟哉此樂不易得，漫嘲長安衆富兒。拜君嘉惠頌酒德，呵手炙研筆能持，欲書八分如阿買，醉寫二子黄絹辭。鷓鴣天（題況又韓先生）  蔡味逸　　九曲寒溪宛轉通，臨流間聽玉琤縱，片雲過處匆匆雨，斜日歸來樹樹紅。峯遠近，路西東，晚風聲裏送疏鐘，游人去後山容寂，野草幽花綠幾重。美國的女飛行員  毛毅　　　　女子駕駛汽車在我國已屬少見，而美國的女性則已躍入學習駕駛飛機的階段了。推進女子飛行運動的是「美國女童子軍會」，她們在一九四二年創立了「飛行女童軍」，由三十個受過特別訓練的童軍領袖到各大城鎭去推廣宣傳，會務進行得異常迅速，廣獲各界的支持和了解，全美四十八州差不多都已設有支部，各地的少女踴躍報名入會，他種的女子飛行組織風起雲湧的競先設立，學成的女飛行員已不在少數。　　杜立德夫人等組織了一個「國家顧問會議」，對飛行女童軍竭力的鼓勵與指導，安諾德將軍亦加以熱烈的贊助。他曾說：「美國的和平與安全有賴於有飛行心的子孫的來臨」，針對這句警語，女童軍會組織了一個試驗的「飛行童軍幼年隊」，專門招收上五歲以下的女孩子，施以基本的飛行訓練，目標是訓練一百萬人。　　雖然如此，女性從事飛行却不是現在的美國女童軍的領袖們所首創的新觀念，在一九二三年所出版的第一册「女童軍手册」就列有「飛行員徽章」一則，出於女童軍運動的創辦人裘麗德·樓之手。頒發這種徽章的限制異常的進步，由請者要「通過氣流與氣候的常識測驗。必須曾經飛行過二十五碼，（或者執有駕駛過飛機的證明文件）和且有一些對引擎的常識。」在另外一節，手册上說：「從事飛行的婦女的數目，證實女性的神經良好，儘可飛行。」　　而在「童軍手册」刋行之前三年多，全世界所公認的第一個女飛行家—雷蒙蒂·羅氏—就已在與男子爭勝了。天下之大  樂　　在十八與十九世紀中，歐洲的跳舞教師常常親自爲那些學舞的紳士淑女們奏樂。他們的樂器頗怪，是一種極小的提琴，這種提琴往往闊祗三英寸，可以放在衣袋裏帶來帶去。　　最近十年來航空事業之突飛猛晋，當然爲人所共知。但正式的升空最高紀錄却還是十年前所創立，迄未有人打破。這紀錄是義大利的梅齊上校在一九三八年十月二十二日造成的，成績爲五萬六千零四十六英尺。伊園主人  清雷學圖　　　　常常在平市發見上海出版的舊筆記小說，用報紙印，整齊淸楚，一切比舊木刻方便。內有一種名曰「伊園　錄」，二十五年廣益書局發行，末署「原著王雪禪」。卷首有王君之序，文內亦未能指實原著爲何人，姑以作序人當之耳。但如此等不曾刋行之著作，能搜求校印，公之於世，旣煞費苦心，且所出甚多，則書局附言「貢獻各界，溥惠學者，」信非虛語。老朽於此旣有所知，自當爲之說明，向出版者及讀者貢其一得之愚。　　按原序云「著者一邦上世家子，儀微人，以壬子釋褐（一八五二，見陸廣甫條），乙亥（一八七五）始出任府守（見夢中愈疾條），於時方回翔仕途三十年，敭歷於開歸道，甘泉使間。」作序者對於原著者之身世所知者止於此。予將原書各節循閱數過，乃辨爲淸同光間以彈劾帝師享時譽之陳御史，亦即光緒中葉有名之六舟京兆也。　　此伊國主人姓陳名　，字六舟，淸同治元年壬戍傳臚，其老太爺名嘉樹，則道光壬午傳臚，父子同甲同次，是爲詞林佳話。是科狀元爲嘉定徐　，榜眼爲江夏何金壽，探花爲太谷溫忠翰。四總裁爲倭仁，萬靑黎，鄭敦謹，熙麟。書中「孽海記」一段所云「德化師」即指萬氏，江西德化人，於著者有座主門生之誼，故稱「師」。漫錄中又有「同年徐頌閣少宰任江西學政日」云云，即指徐郙，字頌閣，淸光緒末官至協辦大學士，諡文愼（書中稱爲「少宰」，是因爲寫記此段時徐氏為吏部侍郎）。又所稱「何鐡生同年」「出守揚州」，即榜眼何金壽，字鐡生。（書中原註「金聲」二字，想是「金壽」之筆誤，或者印錯）。所稱「溫味秋同年」即溫忠翰。又薛綏之（斯來），劉景丞（瑞麒），謝麟伯（維藩），劉補庵（景宸），皆壬戍科，故皆稱同年。　　王君原序說著者「以壬子釋褐」（見陸廣甫條〕，因此條中有一庚午陜　，陸廣甫編修主試」及「廣甫壬子同年」等語，按陸廣甫名爾熙，癸亥翰林，比陳氏晚一科。二人都不是「壬子釋褐」，其所謂「壬子同年」者，鄉貢亦可稱同年，非進士同年也。　　陳由翰林遷御史，淸同治帝以不得於其母西太后，牢騷冶游，致疾短命而死，是甲戍年事。翰林院侍講王慶祺爲同治師傅，曾伴帝微行。淸代野記之「詞臣導淫」一節，成傳者之過甚其辭，而當時人言嘖嘖，同治逝後，更爲羣臣所指摘，欲參勃而難於州措詞。惟陳氏奏摺避開皇帝冶游一節，專舉王氏個人的劣行，西太后就把王翰林革職。陳之原奏，爲眾官所傅誦。　　伊園主人做官的歷史很奇，由諫院外放知府，歷升到巡撫，由巡撫（二品）而內調府尹（三品）由府尹遷宗丞，又放學政，由學政而內調再爲府尹。時而京，時而外，時而地方官，時而掌文衡，都不與人同·書中有明說的，如乙亥之出爲知府（雲南曲靖府），癸未之升開歸道（見「大王神異」段），及甲申冬升甘肅按察使，皆明白叙出。有暗點的，其『九江王」一段末云：「戊子於役金陵」，及「燒卷詩」之「戊子監臨南闈」，皆淸光緒十四年秋之事。時陳已官安徽巡撫，値江南鄉試，試塲在金陵，例係蘇皖兩省合聞，上下江士子雲集南京，由江蘇巡撫與安徽巡撫輪充監臨院。戊子科應皖撫之班。陳又是江蘇人（儀徽屬江蘇掦州），少年時曾在此　中應試，而今又作監臨，故題買院大堂一聯云：一且莫論白簡朱衣，舊夢重尋，難得秀才風味」，「看一片冰壺玉鑑，塵際盡洗，始知上界高寒」，確是撫今思昔，時易境遷的神理。昔為階下士，今爲堂上官，此種風味，只江南關可能有之。因淸制除教官及武職外，本省人不能爲本省官，江南之鄉試雖以蘇皖合關，而蘇皖不算一省，各爲行政區，故蘇撫皖撫須輪班監臨，若皖撫爲蘇人（或蘇撫爲皖人）皆可嘗此特味·此外惟京旗人在北關應試，服官後又可充考官或監臨監試。漢人之直隸籍者　　於順天鄉試各達務則須迴避矣。　　「人面之異」一段云「壬辰二月二十三日試寗波親見之，」那又是他做浙江學合的事了。壬辰爲光緒十八年，陳氏以宗人府丞提浙學，按試寗波府，其宗丞是由府尹升的，而府尹則是由巡撫改的。做過監臨鄉試的撫院，又做考秀才童生的學院，在別人是很少見的。　　原書多神怪故事，誠如王君序中所言，「科塲報應」，「河神神異」，「咒訣　驗」，評以「無識」，誠屬不產。又舉其中案件故事評以「悉具深心」，「有關信史」，可分別觀之，亦是公正的介紹。　　彼時士大夫作記喜談因果報應，如庸　筆記二卷以下多是神怪，北東園筆記全書更似「因果錄」，其他各家者作多少有些奇離怪誕的雜說，足見數十年來神道設教，入人之深。現代人觀之，自不免有陳腐之感。否則車站購票擁擠黄牛黨又將復活社會服務中國旅行社停售三等票　旅客向兩路局呼籲早日復　　否則事站購擁擠黃牛黨又將復活　　　本報讀者蔡嘉淦李傳等函云：逕啓者，自中國旅行社　在兩路车票以來，為設法避免購票擁擠起見，無不力求普遍，列隊購票，向稱促利，從此黄牛黨絕跡，巳不若敵偽時期之難如登天矣。本年兩路客運，一再調整，旅客深感負担加　，此次又以新價調整，同時停此中國旅行社　售三等客票，此舉顯然予一般三等旅客以嚴重威脅。若有閒階級之踏靑遊春，即使僅出售頭二等對號票，亦滿不在乎，要知公務員及寫字間生活之異鄉旅客，必乘星期例假，經常往返，因職務上關係，時間侷促，势難當日至車站列隊購票，祗得忍痛預購二等票，無形雙重加倍，且届春遊時期，購票勢必擁擠，倘僅車站一處發售，則黄牛黨又將復活，不知路局此次之突然措置，究屬有無原因？務請賢明當局予以說明，並望早日恢復，該社售三等客票，以示普及，而　　旅客負祖，不勝　甚·此上兩路管理局南通新生活俱樂部　招商承辦中西餐　　南通新生活俱樂部函云，敬啓者：本俱樂部創設南通中公園（上海乘江康輪船六小時可達）爲各界籌資興建洋房十數間，佈置富麗堂皇，一切中西餐生財器具完全齊備，茲爲服務社會起見，特公開徴求具有服務精神，並對辦理中西餐具有經驗者承辦，本部不收任何費用，並負責　稅，及其他支出，蓋因本部將中西餐招人承辦後，將致可推展新生活運動也。素仰貴欄以社會服務為目的，敬乞賜予刋登爲荷。此致申報服務欄徵求申報　　（一）本報上海讀者　春台君，徴求卅六年四月十三日及十九日本報，通訊處上海（25）肇周路永福里四十一號。　　（二）本報江陰讀者靑靑橡膠百貨批發號，徵求本年二月十三日本報，通訊處江陰北外大弄南。　　（三）本報上海讀者彭慕賢君，徴求本年二月廿五日及廿七日本報，通訊處上海（9）中正北一路二一四弄九〇號。</p>

<h3>The Battle of Luoyang Establishes a Decisive Victory; Domestic and Foreign Troops Made Contact Yesterday; The Bandit Forces Flee in Two Directions, North and South</h3>
<p>Luoyang Area Map</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 16th Dispatch] The bandits attacking Luoyang have begun to retreat in two directions, north and south, carrying with them looted materials as they cross the Yellow River to flee north. Xifu was set on fire on the morning of the 16th, clearly by the retreating bandits. After the National Army reinforcements arrived in the suburbs on the evening of the 14th, the bandits ceased their attacks on the core positions within the city and turned to looting civilians. On the 15th, domestic and foreign troops coordinated their efforts, leading to the bandit defeat. However, there appears to be fierce fighting still occurring in the Longmen area, as the National Army has intercepted the bandits there and is in the process of annihilating them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 16th Dispatch] The National Army has arrived near Luoyang, and fierce fighting has broken out. The communist bandits attacking Luoyang, one group is crossing the Yellow River north via Kuang Kou, and another group crossing the Luo River fleeing south, have reached the Jiangzuo River area on the border of Dengfeng and Yichuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th Dispatch] The National Army reinforcing Luoyang made contact with the defending troops in the city's core positions on the 16th, implementing a pincer attack on the bandits. The bandits fled in two directions, mostly southward, but some are still engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in the southeast corner of the city.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Committee for National Construction in this area has telegraphed to express their respect to Qiu Xingxiang, the National Army division commander who resolutely defended Luoyang and defeated the bandit forces, and is raising a large batch of慰勞品 (comfort items for soldiers) to send as a reward.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 16th Dispatch] The bandit He Chongheng's troops, a special commissioner of the bandit's Yu-Xi area, numbering over two thousand, after seizing Mianchi a few days ago, continued to invade westward.

<h3>Director of the Committee on Policy Toward China Talks; The United States Will Ultimately Actively Assist China; The Far East Division is Controlled by Leftists and Must Be Clarified</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Mr. Colbert, the director of the American Committee on Policy Toward China, recently arrived in the capital for a visit and is scheduled to return to the United States from Shanghai on the 17th. Colbert met with reporters on the 16th and commented on the Sino-American relations: "The mistakes of the past American policy of 'wait and see' toward China will soon be paid for." When commenting on the communist parties around the world, Colbert said: "Whether in the United States, the Czech Republic, the Panama Canal, or China, the Americans have viewed the communists as enemies of the United States." Colbert said that Mrs. Luce, the president of the American Committee on Policy Toward China, believes that the Far East Division of the US Department of State is "controlled by leftists and sympathizers with communism, and this situation must be clarified in order to form a clear policy toward China." Colbert continued to explain that the reason why the American Congress has remained silent on the matter of assistance to China in the past is to avoid stimulating public sentiment. Currently, the US government is suggesting economic assistance to China, while the Congress prefers to provide both economic and military assistance to China at the same time. Colbert believes that in the future, both may be partially realized. Colbert emphasized that if the Republican Party wins in this election, the American assistance to China may become more active. The Republican Party's policy has recently been formally announced by the Republican leader, Governor Dewey of New York. Other influential figures in the Republican Party, such as Republican House Leader Martin, Senator Taft, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, all sympathize with military assistance to China. Therefore, once the Republican Party wins the election, it is expected that a large-scale aid plan for China will be implemented.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Rejects Our Protest; Chennault Refutes It</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] Chennault declared here today that the Soviet Union had rejected China's protest about the shooting down of civil aviation airplanes by Soviet airplanes, arguing that it was without foundation. In reality, the shooting by the Soviet planes was completely unjustified. The Soviet claim that the Chinese airplanes entered the airspace over Lushun and thus "fired a warning shot" was untrue because the shooting incident took place 100 miles outside of the Lushun-Dalian area. The exact position was 38 degrees north latitude, 120 degrees 20 minutes east longitude. At the time of the Soviet aircraft's machine-gunning, the civilian aviation aircraft was not flying close to the Lushun-Dalian base. Mr. Chennault said he would have to stay on for several more weeks before he could return to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Communist Countries Create World Disorder</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng said in a speech at the banquet of Taiwan Provincial People's Representatives today: "The politics of all countries have not stabilized after the war, and the economies have not recovered. The reason for this is that communist countries are obstructing them from within. The general situation in European countries is deteriorating day by day, which is caused by communist countries. Communist countries attempt to launch a third world war, intending to create an unstable situation in all countries, thereby manipulating the world situation. The Chinese Communist Party's rebellion has caused even more damage to China than to other countries. The Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Parties of various countries share the same ideology, that is, the conspiracy to seize power."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Price Stabilization Group of the Overall Economic Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 16th. More than ten people, including Zhang Jiaji, Weng Wenhao, Chen Qitian, Deng Feihuang, Liu Zhendong, He Haoruo, Zou Bingwen, Guan Jiyu, and Gu Yuzhen, attended the meeting, which was chaired by Chen Qitian. They discussed ways to stabilize and control prices and achieved preliminary results, which will be submitted to the Overall Economic Committee for discussion and decision on the 18th. At the meeting on the 16th, both the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Overall Economic Committee presented data on current price increases. Zhang Jiaji, Governor of the Central Bank, also put forward his opinions on price controls, arguing that the control mechanism should be strengthened and the banks should be strictly managed. Liu Zhendong held the opposite view, believing that managing the banks was not as important as using foreign deposits. Liu also suggested that some foreign personnel with no important duties should be recalled to save national foreign exchange. The committee members discussed for a long time and reached two preliminary results: (1) Strengthen the price control mechanism. The Price Committee of the Overall Economic Committee should be strengthened in the future. (2) Adopt a formulaic calculation method to make price increases tend to be stable, changing from soaring to moderate. The Overall Economic Committee has drafted a calculation formula for the price increase of eleven items, including rice, wheat, coal, cotton, flour, yarn, silk, and cocoons, which will determine the degree of price increase based on the interrelationship between (1) the cost of living index, (2) rice prices, and (3) foreign exchange prices.</p>

The military deposits of various banks and vaults in places with Central Bank branches other than the above six places shall be transferred to the Central Bank branches before April 15 in the second installment. The military deposits of various banks and vaults in places without Central Bank branches shall be transferred to the National Bank, which acts as the national treasury agent, before the end of April in the third installment. (2) After the public funds of military agencies are transferred to the Central Bank or the national treasury agent, the Central Bank and the national treasury agent may overdraw the same amount to various banks. (3) The transfer procedures should be handled directly and the deposit institution should be notified. (4) The interest on the deposits of military agencies can still be maintained as before after being transferred to the Central Bank. (5) The deposits of state-owned enterprises may be exempted. The above methods can be implemented after approval, the purpose of which is to avoid the inflow of military and public deposits into the market and to stimulate prices.</p>

<p>Tax Laws Concern People's Burdens; Committees Engage in Fierce Debate</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 16th passed the Income Tax Law, Stamp Tax Law, and Commodity Tax Law, as well as the income tax thresholds and rates for the 37th year. Because these tax laws concern the people's burdens, various committee members spoke on the tax categories, tax rates, and tax amounts during the discussion. The dispute over the Commodity Tax Law was the most intense, with two-thirds of the committee members speaking. The Stamp Tax Law had the fewest amendments.</p>
<p>The Income Tax Law has a total of 163 articles, and reading it took one and a half hours. The first point of contention was the provision in Article 3 regarding the exemption of elementary school teachers' salaries from the second category of income. Wang Yuxiang proposed an amendment, stating that since elementary school teachers were exempt from tax, and university and middle school teachers also had difficult financial lives, they should all be exempt. Chen Guyuan, Liu Butong, Liu Keqiao, Chen Changheng, Sun Jiulu, and others opposed the amendment, arguing that this law was a regular law, while the difficult financial lives of university and middle school teachers were an extraordinary phenomenon. The current tax threshold was very high, and it would have little impact on them. Wang's amendment was rejected. Article 4, regarding the income tax on controlled enterprises, stipulated a tax rate of 5% to 25% of the total amount. Wang Yuxiang, Sun Jiulu, Chen Haicheng, Yang Zhaoyun, and others believed that this was too low and should be raised to 5% to 40%. Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chen Guyuan, Chen Changheng, and others argued that the tax rate was too high, and capital would easily escape. Zhang Zhaoyuan explained that the tax rate in the United States was as high as 90%, but other conditions made this tax rate easy to implement. Wang Yuxiang denied that high tax rates cause capital to escape, arguing that the main reason for escape was social instability. Finally, Liu Butong's compromise suggestion was put to a vote and passed, amending the rate to 5% to 30%. Article 157 was slightly amended in wording and then passed in its entirety. The income tax thresholds and rates were also slightly amended: (1) The tenth item of the first category of income tax on profit-making enterprises was amended to "for income between 5 billion yuan and less than 100 billion yuan, a tax of 25%." The eleventh item was amended to: "for income of 100 billion yuan or more, a uniform tax of 30%." (2) The second item of the comprehensive income tax deduction was amended to "the education deduction is 10 million yuan per person" (please refer to the first page of yesterday's newspaper).</p>
<p>The Stamp Tax Law has a total of 32 articles. The schedule of tax rates was omitted during the reading to save time. The main amendment was only to change "judicial organs" in the articles to "courts."</p>
<p>By the time the Commodity Tax Law was discussed, it was already late, so only the amended articles were read. Article 3, regarding the commodities subject to commodity tax, and Article 4, regarding the tax rates, both caused much debate. Liu Zhiping first spoke on behalf of the people of the North, arguing that it was unfair to tax wheat flour but not rice and that it should be abolished. Chen Changheng, who advocated taxing wheat flour, agreed to reduce it by half, but Liu Zhiping still did not agree. Finally, a vote was taken, and the original item "wheat flour, all machine-made wheat flour is included" was abolished by a majority vote, and the ad valorem tax rate of 2.5% was also abolished. When discussing the tax rates, Er Kang believed that some tax rates were too high and others were too low. Chen Changheng, Liu Keqiao, Cheng Yuanzhen, Liu Zhiping, Liu Tong, and others spoke in succession. The main points of contention were: cosmetics, tinfoil, and joss paper should be raised. Cement and sugar should be lowered. Finally, President Sun presided over the meeting and presented each item for discussion. As a result, the original plan was maintained, and the 17 articles of the Commodity Tax Law were amended and passed.</p>
<p>Draft National Defense Organization Law Returned to Executive Yuan for Re-Drafting</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Defense Organization Law submitted by the Executive Yuan has been rejected by the Legislative Yuan. The original law was returned to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review because the proposed draft law completely violated the six legislative principles. The case had previously been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan's Military Committee and the Legal System Committee, which raised the above-mentioned opinions. During the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 16th, there was unanimous opposition, and it was decided to return it to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting based on the review opinions. Peng Chunshi and Wang Qin and others elaborated on the contradiction between the spirit of the organization law and the legislative principles, stating that the original legislative principles were: (1) the military is subordinate to the government, (2) separation of powers and functions, (3) unification of the army, navy, and air force, (4) hierarchical division of responsibilities, (5) reference to the most advanced national defense systems in the world, (6) suitability to national conditions, but the spirit of the organization law was contrary to these six. Wang Jun also pointed out that the so-called unification of the army, navy, and air force was actually a unification of one person. In the national defense systems of various countries, there is no case where military training, military orders, and military administration belong to one agency. In our country, in addition to the Minister of National Defense, there is also a Chief of Staff. The Minister is not greater than the Chief of Staff, not smaller than the Chief of Staff, nor equal to the Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff is not smaller than the Minister, not greater than the Minister, nor equal to the Minister. This is suitable to national conditions. Chen Changheng focused on the financial aspect, stating that the Audit Department cannot inquire about military expenses, but military expenses account for 70% or 80% of the annual budget. In this case, the Audit Department can be abolished and handled by the Ministry of National Defense. The budgeted number of soldiers is 6 million when reported. How many are there when fighting a war? Liu Zhiping even said: Such an organization law is neither beautiful nor heroic. It may as well be published in the newspaper for everyone to see. Finally, it was decided to pass according to the review opinions and return it to the government for re-drafting based on the legislative principles and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>

<h3>On Rationing</h3>
<p>— Chen Daisun</p>
<p>The comprehensive rationing of food in the five major cities, according to official claims: has already started in Nanjing and Shanghai in March, and is scheduled to start in Tianjin, Beiping, and Guangzhou in April. The initial four months of implementation are set as a trial period, but the government will strive to make this system a permanent method of controlling food sources. This is the government's first attempt at a food rationing system. The proposal for this plan stems from the US aid agreement to China. According to Article 2 of the Sino-US relief agreement, the Chinese government "should establish rationing and price control systems in major Chinese cities where the environment permits, in order to ensure that people of all levels, regardless of their purchasing power, should obtain a fair allocation of relief materials imported from abroad or produced locally." Because the US food supplied under this agreement is insufficient for comprehensive rationing, the decided method is that, during this trial period, half of the rations will be taken from US supplies, and the other half will be supplied by the Ministry of Food and the five municipal governments. The trial period is limited to four months because the US food provided under the US aid agreement is only for this short period of rationing.</p>
<p>If rationing is limited to US food, and the target of rationing is limited to a certain class of people, the purpose of rationing should be relief or subsidy. However, now it is full rationing - although during the trial period, only the citizens of the five cities are the target of rationing - and the government is responsible for supplying half of the rations in addition to US food. It can be seen that this method is to use US food as a foundation, implement rationing, with the aim of stabilizing food prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Our evaluation of this method and its future effectiveness should also be based on this purpose.</p>
<p>Quantitative rationing is indeed an important distribution system for controlling prices. Of course, we should not mistakenly believe that as long as there is a quantitative rationing system, prices will be stabilized. Price increases have various conditions. If the conditions exist, even with a rationing system, prices will still rise. But if there is no quantitative rationing to cooperate with the implementation of various price control measures, there will be loopholes in this system, and the results of price stabilization will be affected.</p>
<p>If this method aims at stabilizing prices, then (1) the so-called rationing must be strictly implemented as quantitative rationing, and (2) the government must have effective control over the supply of all food.</p>
<p>Strictly implementing quantitative rationing means that the total amount of food purchased by each person per month, regardless of the source, has a fixed address. The quantitative limit is based on the amount of consumption each person should have. The main use of the quantitative rationing system is to restrict consumers—especially wealthy consumers. In a free market, as long as consumers have money, they can use all their money to bid for goods. Consumers' intensified bidding is the reason for strengthening the price increase. Under the quantitative rationing system, the total amount that each person can buy has a limit, and having money cannot arbitrarily bid for goods. Part of the purchasing power in society is frozen and cannot become an effective demand for goods in the market. However, the minimum needs of the general public can be met equally. This method focuses on the allocation of food supplied by the United States and food supplied by the Ministry of Food and various municipal governments. The total amount allocated to each city each month from these two sources is actually less than the monthly consumption required by each city. Taking Beiping as an example, with a population of 1.7 million, assuming that each large household needs 30 catties of flour per month and each small household needs 15 catties, 970,000 bags are needed each month. However, the food allocation meeting decided on a ration of 15 catties per month for everyone, regardless of age or gender, totaling 580,000 bags. If the rations distributed by the government are limited to those supplied by the United States and the two types of official food supplied by the Ministry of Food and the Municipal Government, the people still have to rely on the free market for their needs beyond the 15 catties per person. Furthermore, if there is a quantitative limit on the purchase of official food, and there are still no restrictions on buying and selling in the free market, then this method is not strictly implementing a quantitative rationing system, because the total amount of purchases by the people is still not limited. The effectiveness of the quantitative rationing system will not be produced. Therefore, in order to strictly implement the quantitative rationing system, the total amount purchased by each citizen each month must be stipulated. If the method of purchasing with vouchers is adopted, and the total amount purchased per month is stipulated as 30 catties for each large household and 15 catties for each small household, then each voucher can not only be used to buy 15 catties of official food per person per month but also to purchase the difference in the general market. Of course, the municipal government can also be responsible for supplying all the food needs of all citizens. (In this case, the general market will be completely abolished.) Official food rationing is also quantitative rationing. However, this further method is not necessary.</p>
<p>Another aspect of quantitative rationing is that the government must have effective control over the supply of goods. The food control required by the food quantitative rationing system does not necessarily require the cancellation of the ordinary market, with official food supplying all the rationing. If the government must purchase the entire amount of food for rationing, then it is considered effective control. Although the rationing system is limited to the five cities, the capital required is considerable. In fact, the so-called effective control only refers to (1) unblocking food sources, so that food from outside the city can come regularly; (2) cracking down on hoarding and speculation; (3) eliminating the black market, so that food purchasers must purchase with vouchers and must not exceed the quantitative limit, so as to avoid having a quota but lacking food to ration, or having food to ration but being manipulated by speculators. In fact, the current government already has a large amount of official food in hand when promoting this method, and what it relies on is already very superior. The official food in hand is of course completely controlled. Since it controls a portion of the supply, the question is how to control the required difference. The points mentioned above are on the one hand administrative technical issues; on the other hand, they are law enforcement issues. The latter is more important. If the government cannot sanction the illegal activities of bureaucrats, wealthy families, and special figures: then speculation, hoarding, and the black market will still exist. How can effective control of the food supply be achieved?</p>
<p>There is also the issue of food prices. This method stipulates that the rationing price is equal to 95% of the market price and fluctuates with the market price. Some people suspect, since it is official food, why can't the official price be much lower than the market price, so that the common people can get some real benefits? Why does the official price have to fluctuate with the market price? The problem lies in the purpose of rationing. If the purpose of rationing is relief or subsidy, then a low price is justified. A low price is equivalent to giving a gift. Giving gifts is not impossible; it just depends on whether it should be given. As long as there is a need for relief or subsidy, then the government is willing to use the method of giving food to achieve this purpose, which is not impossible. However, if it is relief or subsidy, why is a no price is better than a low price. A zero price at least has one advantage, which is that the nature of relief or subsidy is more obvious. Furthermore, if it is to be the most relief, it should only benefit the poor, and the rich and the poor should not receive relief equally. If it is a subsidy, then those who need to be subsidized must have a reason for being subsidized in their work or position. With the single qualification of citizens of the five cities, there is no reason to be relieved or subsidized. Therefore, if the purpose of this method is relief or subsidy, then full rationing is unreasonable. Since it is full rationing, it should not be relief or subsidy. However, if official food fluctuates with the market price, then what is the use of stabilizing market prices? Originally, quantitative rationing should have a price limit policy to cooperate with it. This method is indeed lacking. We believe that this shows the realistic attitude of those who formulated this method. The effectiveness of quantitative rationing in stabilizing prices lies in restricting consumption to reduce effective social demand. If inflation is progressing very slightly, and other measures - such as cracking down on hoarding, speculation, the black market, etc. - are quite effective, the reduction in consumption may offset the impact of inflation. However, if inflation surges forward, the power of consumption reduction is too small in comparison, and the market price must continue to rise. The current situation is like this. We guess that the people who formulated the rationing method believe that under today's severe inflation, no matter what steps are taken, food prices will still rise in the future. If there is a price limit, the price limit may also need to be adjusted with the market price, then the price limit is equal to a mere formality. There is only one hope, that since the government has absolute control over a portion of the food, the elements and power of speculation that can hoard the remaining portion of the food supply can be greatly reduced. If the government can take this opportunity to strictly control the ordinary market that supplies this portion of food, and strive to eliminate hoarding and the black market, then after the implementation of the rationing method, although the natural price increase of food following the general price increase is inevitable, the sharp increase caused by human factors may be eliminated. The work of stabilizing food prices is not without a little help.</p>

<h3>Truman to Address Congress Today on Major US Policy Declaration: Military Preparedness to Resist Totalitarian Aggression</h3>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Washington, dated 16th] President Truman will address a joint session of the hastily convened House and Senate on the 17th, delivering a large-scale "preparedness plan" based on the principle of using American military strength to support its foreign policy. This plan will be used to ensure American security to guard against any consequences arising from the United States thoroughly implementing the Truman Doctrine and supporting any country in Europe resisting totalitarian aggression. Sources say that the Scandinavian countries are also included within the scope of the Truman Doctrine. The legislative measures that President Truman will recommend have not yet been revealed, but it is understood that President Truman is now under significant pressure to present a model plan to mobilize American resources to resist threats to the integrity of European countries. According to well-informed sources, the measures currently under discussion include rebuilding the national conscription system, restoring wartime control over industry, restoring the lend-lease program, and declaring a national emergency. Some compare the current situation to the fall of France in 1940, when then-President Roosevelt declared a national emergency and called on the entire country to implement a large-scale "preparedness plan." The fact that President Truman will address Congress was announced yesterday by White House Press Secretary Ross, but Ross did not clarify the reason for the President's address, only saying that the content of the address is related to the situation abroad.</p>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Washington, dated 16th] President Truman will deliver a solemn and definitive declaration of American foreign policy to the joint session of both Houses. According to American tradition, the convening of a joint session is for the purpose of issuing historical declarations, and the fact that President Truman notified Congress shortly before the convening of the joint session further demonstrates the urgency of the declaration to be issued. In light of the widespread rumors and war stories of the past week, Congressional figures expect that what Truman will announce will be an extremely serious policy with major implications for the development of the European situation. The President's address to the joint session of both Houses shows that his policy will require legislative action.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Declaration</p>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Washington, dated 16th] Sources close to the White House told Washington reporter Pearson that Truman's policy address to the joint session of both Houses would include the following affirmative responsibilities: (1) Soviet interference in the internal affairs of Greece, Turkey, Italy, France, and Finland will be immediately followed by American action; (2) Truman will declare that this action will not only be diplomatic severance but will far exceed the scope of severance; (3) The United States will publicly endorse the West European Union with a guarantee of military assistance; (4) Truman will request increased military spending to strengthen American military strength, especially air force strength, and will request an appropriation of three billion dollars to build long-range bombers that will penetrate deep into the Soviet Union in future wars. Pearson said that this declaration will include the final words that the United States will say.</p>
<h3>US Senate Unanimously Passes Law to Arm Merchant Ships at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The US Senate today unanimously passed a bill permitting the arming of merchant ships in the event of a national emergency. The bill, once approved by the House of Representatives and signed by the President, will become law. The law authorizing the arming of merchant ships during World War II expired last year. The purpose of this bill is to make the authority to arm merchant ships permanent. The definition of a national emergency is stipulated as "any time the President determines that the security of the United States is threatened by the use or imminent use of force by any foreign government or organization against the United States, its citizens, its property, or its commercial interests."</p>

<p>100,000 Meatpackers Strike</p>

<p>Japan and Korea May Be Listed as Members in the Future</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baguio, 16th, United Press] The four-week United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization conference has come to a close. The location of the organization's Asian office has not yet been determined. As a result of the vote, a majority of representatives approved the address of the office changing every two years, with nine Asian member states rotating as the address of the office. In addition, the main proposals at the meeting included: (1) establishing an Indian Ocean-Pacific Fisheries Commission; (2) international cooperation to improve nutritional standards in Asian countries; (3) establishing an International Rice Commission; (4) establishing a Far East Rice Survey Commission; and (5) promoting rice conservation campaigns.</p>
<p>[United Press, Baguio, 16th] The Nine-Nation Rice Conference decided today that once Korea and Japan have established independent governments, they will be invited to join the Southeast Asian branch of the FAO. Australia and New Zealand were also invited to participate.</p>
<h3>The Future President of Italy Appears to Be None Other Than Nicola</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 15th] Political observers here predicted today that the parliament to be elected on April 18 will elect current interim President Nicola as Italy's first official president. However, Nicola, who is 69 years old, is weak and ill and has long intended to retire. If elected, he will definitely decline in order to retire. Nicola was originally a timid believer in parliamentarianism, selfless and impartial. People from all parties are happy to associate with him, so he has no political enemies in his life. Therefore, it is quite difficult to find another presidential candidate who can be accepted by all parties. Under these circumstances, all parties may unanimously ask him to reluctantly take on the burden.</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Tianjin Legal Communities Petition Judiciary to Postpone Special Criminal Court; Consider Creation of This Deformed Tribunal to Affect Constitutional Future</h3>
<p>[Our report] With the Special Criminal Court being established and scheduled to begin hearing cases next month, the Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that proceedings should be postponed until the draft law is passed by the Legislative Yuan. Yesterday, it separately petitioned the Nanjing Judicial Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Judicial Administration, and National Political Council, stating, "Yesterday, according to reports in the Shanghai newspapers, the Special Criminal Court was established on the 11th of this month and began operating immediately. This association was shocked upon hearing this news. The draft of the Organization Law of the Special Criminal Court is currently in the review stage in the Legislative Yuan. The fact that the Special Criminal Court was established before the draft law was passed is a terrible precedent unheard of in Chinese and foreign judicial history. Moreover, in the year of constitutional implementation, the creation of a deformed trial system and the fragmentation of a gradually complete legal system is, we deeply believe, unacceptable. Furthermore, according to the draft regulations of the Organization Law of the Court, the applicable laws are those with the highest possible punishment being death or life imprisonment, with one trial being final and no appeal allowed. These are matters of the greatest importance related to the fundamental rights of the people. If a special court that does not conform to the organization of the courts engages in deformed trials, it will cause public concern and deepen popular grievances. The future of constitutionalism is unimaginable. This association, feeling endangered, cannot remain silent. We dare to contribute our humble opinion and telegraph to your Yuan (Ministry), earnestly requesting that you reconsider carefully and consult with the relevant Yuans and Ministries. Please order the Special Criminal Court to temporarily postpone proceedings until the draft law has been formally passed by the Legislative Yuan, in order to uphold the Constitution and promote the rule of law."</p>
<h3>Demanding Immediate Departure: Wounded Veterans Surround North Station; Station Master and Others Beaten; All Trains Delayed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, one thousand and seventy wounded veterans from various northeastern battlefields arrived in Shanghai via the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhang vessel from Tianjin. Of these, 297 were sent to Danyang Rear Hospital for recuperation, and 773 were sent to Suzhou Rear Hospital. At approximately 1:00 PM, the Joint Logistics Headquarters dispatched personnel to the Railway Bureau Military Transportation Office to arrange for transportation vehicles. It was agreed that a temporary "Sanitary Train" would be added to transport the wounded veterans, with four additional dedicated cars to be attached to Train No. 52 departing at 4:40 AM this morning. Later, the wounded soldiers complained about the late departure time, so the cars were reassigned to Train No. 58 departing at 5:45 PM last night.</p>
<p>The wounded soldiers then demanded an additional two dedicated cars and a tea and water car. After lengthy negotiations, much time had passed, and the repeated loading and unloading of vehicles caused considerable inconvenience. As it was already dark, the train still had not departed. The wounded soldiers in the cars became impatient and repeatedly sent representatives to urge the station master to expedite the departure. However, the station authorities, constrained by traffic order and scheduling regulations, could not readily approve the requests, leading to a misunderstanding. At 8:40 PM, several hundred veterans swarmed and surrounded the station master's office, causing chaos. The on-duty station master and others fled. Passengers, seeing the severity of the situation, also scrambled to escape. The platform station master, Lu Xiu, was the first to be beaten and injured. Wang Ronglin, a station worker from the general station master's office, along with an electrician, a car inspector, and five others involved in car numbering, were also beaten and injured. At 9:00 PM, the general station master, Liu Shizhong, arrived upon hearing the news, and, with the assistance of Section Chief Liu of the Military Transportation Office, made every effort to persuade and assure that the train would depart immediately, preventing further escalation of the situation. However, within the three hours before the departure of the train, the dispute remained unresolved, and all arriving and departing trains at the North Station were blocked. All southbound trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line were held at Zhenru Station and other locations, while northbound trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line were congested between Xujiahui Station and the West Station. Eight trains, including Nos. 26, 80, 43, 56, 7, 22 (West Lake), 15, and 79, were either delayed in arrival or departure by varying amounts of time, ranging from one to two hours.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Cannot Be Procured in Large Quantities; Universal Distribution Plan Abandoned</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau previously planned to implement a comprehensive distribution of coal briquettes, with each of the city's 700,000+ households receiving one "dan" (approximately 50 kg) per month. According to Director Wu yesterday, this plan has been abandoned because it is difficult to procure an additional 200,000+ "dan" of coal. The bureau will only continue to distribute coal briquettes to 500,000 industrial and vocational workers.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Gold and Foreign Currency Operations on Qipu Road; Radio Transmitter Seized on Ningbo Road</h3>
<p>The Economic Section of the Investigation Division of the Garrison Headquarters recently received a tip and cracked down on a black market gold trading operation at a building on Qipu Road. At the time, someone from Lao Tianbao Silver Shop on Chengdu Road, near Baike Road, was caught attempting to trade 14 taels of gold at the location. They were immediately arrested. A search of the account books at the address led to the detention of the main culprits, Luo Youcheng and Zhang Xiangguo. It is reported that the case will be fully investigated and handed over to the court within days. In addition, the Radio Monitoring Section of the Garrison Headquarters recently seized a radio transmitter at No. 109 Ningbo Road, which was used to broadcast black market gold and foreign currency prices. The main culprit, Ma Shuzhi, is currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Old Hongbao Buying and Selling Gold Jewelry; Evidence Confiscated and Fines Imposed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the case of Lao Hongbao Silver Shop being caught buying and selling black market gold jewelry on Changyang Road, the gold jewelry and rings confiscated at the time have been reviewed and approved by the Municipal Government. Yesterday, it was ordered that the items be confiscated and a fine of five times the business's turnover be imposed.</p>
<h3>Preventing the Outflow of Cash to the South; Financial Bureau Requests Assistance with Secret Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to prevent the outflow of large sums of cash to the south, the Municipal Financial Management Bureau yesterday sent a letter to the Police Bureau requesting assistance with a secret investigation. Anyone found to be remitting cash over the 50 million yuan limit set by the Ministry of Finance will be arrested and prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Expanding Vaccination Programs; Organizing Mobile Teams</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the Anti-Epidemic Committee expanded the vaccination program on the first of this month, a total of 118,842 people have been vaccinated. Including the previous two months, a total of 467,731 people have been vaccinated. A total of 138 vaccination stations and 94 mobile teams have been established throughout the city to administer vaccinations in shantytowns, refugee camps, schools, and factories. The districts of Laozha, Hongkou, Yulin, and Putuo have shown particularly good vaccination results.</p>
<h3>Journalist Delegation Visiting Burma Scheduled to Return Home by Plane on the 19th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) China-Burma air route has been successfully test flown, and the first official scheduled flight has already departed.

<h3>Famous American Photographer Prepares to Film at His Own Expense; Huang Zongzhan Arrives in Shanghai with Color Film; Seeks Lead Roles for "Rickshaw Boy"; Hopes to Introduce China's Inherent Culture and Morality</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Huang Zongzhan, a world-renowned Chinese photographer residing in Hollywood, known for his skill in photographing glamorous female stars, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon. Huang recently established Pan-American Film Company with his own funds, serving as its president. His first film project is planned to be an adaptation of Lao She's famous work, "Rickshaw Boy." The script has already been commissioned to a famous Hollywood screenwriter, Raoul, for US$15,000 and will be completed soon. Huang's visit is to scout for actors in his home country, as well as to collect materials in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places to prepare for filming. Huang will stay in Shanghai briefly before heading to Beijing on the 18th. It is said that "Rickshaw Boy" will be entirely cast with Chinese actors and actresses for the main and supporting roles. The dialogue will be in English. It was rumored that the female lead has already been decided on a certain Shanghai star, but Huang specifically denied this yesterday.</p>
<p>Huang continued, stating that he has been serving the Hollywood film industry for more than 20 years, and his personal regret is that while films from other countries can create a sensation when screened in the United States, Chinese films have consistently failed to be shown in American first-run theaters. He is determined to produce films with Chinese stories and Chinese actors and actresses. On one hand, he hopes to use the film to introduce China's inherent culture, morality, and the actual lives of his fellow countrymen to the American people. At the same time, he hopes to take this opportunity to cultivate some male and female actors in China, giving them opportunities to film in America in the future, hoping they can compete with British and American stars in the arts and gain recognition on the international film scene. He plans to stay in Beijing for two weeks, and he brought a lot of color film from the United States. After arriving in Beijing, he will select beautiful scenery and shoot extensively. He will then return to the United States via Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, and will continue to collect exterior shots along the way to research which can be used as the film's background after arriving in Hollywood. When the film is shot domestically in the future, the props will be shipped from the United States and sent back to the United States for developing and editing after filming. He will use his 20 years of experience in filmmaking, the film’s narrative, production, lighting, and structure, all will be handled with a pure Chinese approach, abandoning the so-called "hype" commonly used in Hollywood, hoping that after the film is completed, it can become a quiet Chinese painting, so that China's inherent artistic spirit can be fully utilized and can also be widely promoted internationally in the future.</p>
<p>Desired Qualities for Male and Female Leads</p>
<p>"Rickshaw Boy" has very high sales in the United States, with 5 million copies currently sold, which proves that Americans are very interested in the book. If the film is completed, it will definitely cause a sensation. Pan-American Film Company has decided to spend US$500,000 to shoot the film. If the scale is large, it may increase funding. Huang's most important leading roles to be found in China are three: one is Rickshaw Boy, whose ideal conditions are a male aged 19 to 29, 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighing about 160 pounds, with a face that does not need to be handsome, as long as it is Qingxiu, honest, kind, full of wisdom, and not good at speaking. The other is Tiger Girl, a young girl aged 19 to 20, naive, but rich in quiet beauty. In addition, a female lead between the ages of 30 and 31 with a moderate figure is also needed, exquisite and pretty, but with a hateful appearance similar to the person in the book.</p>
<p>Having Gone Abroad at the Age of Five, Superstitions Remain</p>
<p>Huang Zongzhan has a strong physique, similar to that of a boxer, and speaks calmly, without the typical pretentiousness of Hollywood celebrities. His view of "beauty" is extremely cultivated and profound. Huang is from Taishan, Guangdong. At the age of five, he went to the United States with his parents to do business, studying at a middle school in Pasco, Washington for two years. He loved photography since he was a child. He once bought a "Brownie" with the money he earned from selling newspapers to take photos of his family. Because the "Brownie" lacked a "viewfinder," the characters in the photos were missing from the neck up. His family was used to superstition and blamed him. Huang then asked to buy a new machine with ten US dollars and continued his research, which greatly improved. Although Huang has lived in the United States for many years, the concept of superstitious beliefs from Guangzhou and Hangzhou still exists. Yesterday, when he was smoking cigarettes with reporters in the hotel, he still refused to light three cigarettes with one match.</p>
<p>Female Star Common Sense Soaring</p>
<p>In 1917, Huang entered Hollywood as a photographer through a classmate, starting with a weekly salary of ten dollars, and gradually rose to the position of following and carrying the camera. In his spare time, he used the lights in the arena to practice shooting portraits of stars with his own old camera and sold them piecemeal. Once, he accidentally took a photo of famous actress Mary Minter and sold it for five dimes. Mary was amazed when she saw it, thinking it was a miracle, saying that the results were so good that she had never seen it before. She asked if he was confident in shooting during the performance. Huang said he would like to try it. Mary immediately asked the director, and after that, each of her starring films specified that Huang must produce it. Huang then leaped into the film industry and sailed smoothly. Stars known for their sexiness for a time, such as Joan Crawford, Hedy Lamarr, Greta Swanson, Ann Sheridan, Marlene Dietrich, and Marlene Carroll, all hired Huang to make films. They firmly believed that Huang's production would definitely increase their charm, so Huang became the chief photographer in Hollywood, and many stars relied on Huang's films to become famous after receiving rave reviews from all parties.</p>
<p>Filming One Film Costs US$50,000</p>
<p>Because of his deeper experience, he is familiar with the personalities of various stars. The angles and poses do not need to be studied, and he knows them like the back of his hand, so there are few re-shoots or remakes. The standard price for filming in the United States now is US$50,000 per film, and someone once offered a high price of US$100,000 for 42 weeks of work a year. He believes that photographers must first take good portraits of people before they can make close-ups and locks. He believes that his most satisfactory works in the past are Mrs. Miniver, Objective, Burma!, Since You Went Away, Yankee Doodle Dandy, and The Fighting 69th. As for the three who are most confident in their beautiful bells, they are Joan Crawford, Hedy Lamarr, and Ann Sheridan.</p>

<h3>Realizing People's Politics; Overthrowing Corrupt Officials; Opinions of the Central Training Corps Students on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Alumni Association of the Central Training Corps decided to publish a declaration on the current situation when it last commemorated the 10th anniversary of the parent organization. After several meetings and research, the Shanghai alumni drafted their opinions on the current situation, advocating the completion of a "comprehensive system for suppressing rebellion and mobilization," with thorough coordination in political, economic, and social aspects for suppressing rebellion and mobilization, advocating for: (1) Realizing "politics of the people," opposing bureaucratic politics. Politics must be linked to the lives of the people and seek effectiveness from the lives of the people. (2) Overthrowing bureaucratic politics, corrupt officials, and wealthy capitalists, and establishing a truly democratic governance of the people. (3) Thoroughly reorganizing central personnel, eradicating feudal forces in local autonomy, achieving clean politics, and returning power to the real people. (4) Overthrowing wealth concentration and establishing a economic system of People's Livelihood. (5) Converting special relief donations into property taxes, avoiding universal solicitation, and requiring wealthy families to bear the burden. (6) Reforming the Kuomintang, restoring revolutionary leadership, and democratic centralism, etc.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiangwen to Marry; White Hair Ties the Knot</h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] It is still remembered that fifteen years ago, Xiong Fenghuang and Mao Yanwen were married at Moore Memorial Church. The combination of red beauty and white hair, as well as being a match made in heaven, was passed around as a happy story. Last year, the combination of Central Committee member Li Shizeng and writer Lin Sushan was also a perfect marriage. Recently, there has been another new couple who have been friends for 25 years, ultimately resulting in a happy marriage.</p>
<p>Speaking of these two, readers must be very familiar with them. The woman is Zhang Xiangwen, a famous doctor in Shanghai who has served society for 30 years as the director of Renhe Hospital and Shangxian Hospital. The man is Wang Gupan, a pioneer in the Chinese police force who has served as the director of the Capital Police Department, the director of the Interior Ministry Higher Police Academy, the director of the Zhejiang Police Academy, and the mayor of Xiamen before the war. Director Zhang is 52 years old this year. In the past decades, she has been focused on hard work, cultivating talents in obstetrics and gynecology, striving to serve society, and promoting new medicine, making significant contributions. She never thought of planning to form a new family. Therefore, when the news of her impending marriage suddenly spread, her relatives, friends, and students were very surprised. Because the news was extremely mysterious, both parties were very secretive until the Lantern Festival in the old calendar, when the two families held a reception, revealing a hint of information.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is 64 years old this year, full of spirit and looks very young. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a member of the Central Police Academy's school affairs committee and managed German and Italian enemy僑 in Chongqing, which was deeply valued by the Central Government. He used his official俸 from previous years to build a church on Gele Mountain to preach the gospel. It is said that it was Zhang's idea. They are both Christians and initially met in New York City 25 years ago. At that time, Ms. Zhang was studying in the New World, and Mr. Wang represented China at the World Police Conference. The two hit it off at first sight. Later, they went their separate ways, both striving to do their best for society and the country. Speaking of their friendship, it is noble and sincere. Last autumn, Mr. Wang lost his spouse, and there was a lack of someone to take care of his domestic affairs, so he talked to Ms. Zhang about the issue of marriage.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Zhang, the original intention of marriage is not based on affection, but on the basis of decades of deep friendship to become husband and wife to avoid the boredom of old age for both parties. With a new family, she will not give up her own career, but on the contrary, will encourage the spirit of courage to serve the society and benefit the people. As for their auspicious date, there is no definite date now, but it will probably be in a month or two. (The picture shows recent photos of Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang)</p>
<p>Not About Affection; Avoiding the Boredom of Old Age</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Director States That the Index Cannot Be Frozen; Believes That the Decline of Industry Is Unrelated to the Index</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Industrial Association previously stated that due to the increase in the cost of living index, many of the member factories were unable to afford it. The 18th joint meeting of directors and supervisors decided to request the government to rigidly stipulate that this month's wages should be calculated based on the cost of living index of the previous month in order to calculate costs. The various industries of this city have paid close attention to this proposal by the Industrial Association, and the General Labour Union has publicly expressed its opposition. According to Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, he has not yet received the official documents of the Industrial Association. Regarding this suggestion, he believes that the decline of industry is not caused by the index problem. The survival of factories lies in the sales of goods. Now, due to rising prices and the decline in people's purchasing power, the sales of factory products have become stagnant. The increase in the cost of living index is based on prices. If the index is frozen rashly, it will directly affect the lives of workers and indirectly affect social security. The Social Affairs Bureau does not intend to request instructions from the central government on this issue, but prepares to solve it directly. It is necessary to conduct serious research so that both labor and management can maintain the status quo without worrying about one thing and losing sight of the other.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Registration Is Only Intended to Facilitate Statistics</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the person in charge of the Business Office of the Telecommunications Bureau, the purpose of the bureau's registration of radios is to facilitate statistics, and there is absolutely no intention to control them, nor does it charge any fees. The registration procedure is also very simple. The first phase of registration is scheduled to end at the end of this month. The bureau is now doing its best to persuade citizens who own radios to register automatically, and there are no penalty regulations for the time being.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Personnel to Go to the United States for Inspection; Take Off in Two Batches Today</h3>
<p>In order to develop its business, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) specially sent Cai Zhiren, director of the company's Shanghai office, Sheng Bingyu, head of the accounting department of the head office, and Cai Kefei, secretary of the flight group, to the United States for inspection on the morning of the 17th by West Airlines flight.</p>
<p>In addition, the six Convair-240 passenger planes ordered by the company in the United States last year are expected to arrive in Shanghai successively in June and July of this year. The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has specially sent technicians from the aircraft group to the United States to conduct on-site research at the aircraft's manufacturing plant. The first batch of personnel to go to the United States is also scheduled to fly from Shanghai to San Francisco by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight on the afternoon of the 17th, and then transfer to the Convair-240 aircraft manufacturing plant. In the future, the new type of aircraft will be personally driven to Shanghai by technicians and pilots of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC).</p>
<h3>Xuhui to Hold Regular Re-election of District Head</h3>

The Municipal Government ordered the district yesterday to convene a district representative conference on the 25th to re-elect the district head and deputy district head, and limited the registration period for candidates for district head and deputy district head from now until the 21st.</p>
<h3>Shareholders of China Textile No. 2 Dyeing and Printing Factory Petition</h3>

The police bureau misunderstood and arrested several people, who were released immediately. That evening, Wu and others also held a reception for the press at the New Life Club to report the details and request sympathy and assistance.</p>
<h3>Continued Interrogation of Liu Shaoqing in the Case of Raising Prices for Air Freight</h3>

<h3>The Mayor and His Wife Return; Resting by the Lake; Back Pain Fully Recovered</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu and his wife took leave from the Executive Yuan on the 9th of this month to rest in Hangzhou, and arrived at the West Station at 7:45 PM yesterday by the West Lake Express.

<h3>洋囡囡哭泣了　說道遭串通欺侮　毛秀珍恕夫年青受惑　沈鞏偉恨妻子決心離異</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Li Zhen, the "Yang Nannan" (foreign doll) dance hostess, and Shen Gongwei's romantic entanglement, for which Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, filed a case accusing them of adultery, was heard in court on the 21st of last month. The hearing continued yesterday morning at the court. Li arrived in court wearing a beige wool cheongsam, a mink-trimmed leopard print coat, a green scarf, and coffee-colored suede high heels. Mao wore a lake-colored wool coat, a lake-colored cheongsam, black high heels, and light makeup. Shen was brought from the Sinan Road detention center, still wearing a dark blue melton coat. At 9:20 AM, Judge Zhou Shitai took the stand and first questioned the plaintiff, Mao Xiuzhen. Mao stated yesterday that she still had feelings for Shen and would not pursue the matter further, declaring in court that she would withdraw the charges against Shen Gongwei, saying that Shen was young and seduced by Li Zhen, and asked the court to be lenient. However, she would continue to pursue the charges against the second defendant, Li Zhen, and asked the court to severely punish her, and would not withdraw the civil suit, claiming that Shen took out the jewelry at Li's instigation. The court asked if there was any evidence, and she replied that it was a domestic dispute and there was no evidence to provide. Then, Li Zhen testified that she had a relationship with Li in June of last year, and that the plaintiff, Mao, usually interacted with her, and it was not a recent occurrence. She stated that they as dance hostesses had a hard life, and had to be attentive to customers, and had no intention of interfering with Shen's family. She said that Shen and Mao colluded to bully her, which was heartbreaking. She also said that usually when Shen and her were together, she was the one spending the money, and she never saw Shen take jewelry from his house. Mao intended to extort money. Li became saddened as she testified, and tears welled up in her eyes and she sobbed. Subsequently, Shen's defense lawyer, Fei Xizhen, argued on his behalf regarding the private possession of a handgun, and Li's defense lawyers, Lu Shaozong and Lu Kuqing, argued on her behalf regarding the charge of adultery, saying that Mao had been permissive beforehand and tolerant afterward, and according to the law, had lost the right to sue. Attorney Fei stood up and requested that Shen Gongwei be released on bail, and the court agreed to release him on bail. Finally, the court ordered that the verdict in the case would be announced at 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month. After leaving the court, Shen told reporters that there was no possibility of reconciliation with Mao Xiuzhen and that he was willing to spend dozens of gold bars to divorce Mao. When asked by reporters if he would live with Li, he smiled and did not answer.</p>

<h3>被控冒領配給證　宋海屏昨受傳訊</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Song Haiping, acting president of the China United News Agency, was accused by the former editor-in-chief of the agency, Hu Diya, of inflating the number of employees and fraudulently obtaining ration cards. The district prosecutor's office opened a court hearing yesterday afternoon and summoned He Zhuming, an employee of the agency, to testify. Prosecutor Liang Gengshun questioned them. According to Song, the agency has been closed for a long time and has not received rations for a long time, so Hu's accusation is not true. Hu insisted that Song embezzled the ration cards and claimed that he had a large bag of privately made seals for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining rations. As a result, the prosecutor ordered the defendant to provide a guarantor and ordered the bailiffs to search the Shanghai Law School (because Song also served as a professor at the Shanghai Law School) and the China United News Agency to see if there was any privately made seals as claimed by the plaintiff.</p>

<h3>招商局登陸艇　營口歷險記　入匪掌·冒大砲火　負重傷·昂然歸來</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Tianjin, 12th by Air Mail] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhong 105 landing craft, loaded with military supplies from Huludao to reinforce Yingkou on the 26th of last month, arrived outside Yingkou Port on the 27th and entered the port on the 28th. It was seized by the Communist bandits. Later, it was repeatedly forced by the Communist bandits to sail to Dalian, but it failed to do so due to the thick ice on the sea. On March 1, it was discovered by our air force. After that, the wheel risked escaping under heavy fire. When it escaped, the steering gear was blown up, the circuit was broken, and the front gun was leaking. The situation was extremely dire. On the 3rd, it was discovered by our Yongding warship, which escorted it to Huludao. On the 7th, it was towed to Tanggu by the Jiping. It arrived at 8:00 PM. The hull was scarred and many crew members were killed or injured. It has now entered the dock for repairs and will resume the heavy task of maritime transportation. The wheel has released the following account of its adventure:</p>
<p>Stopped on Ice</p>
<p>This wheel was ordered by "Beiji No. 1" (Note: This is a New Port icebreaker, which had just arrived in Tanggu and was transferred to Huludao to break the ice) and Director Zhao, together with Liaison Officer Wang, loaded 5,000 bags of military rice, 38 barrels of gasoline, 320 packages of pickled mustard, 37 bags of edible salt, and 30 tons of ammunition in Huludao. It left Huludao at 13:45 on February 26 and headed for Yingkou. Liaison Officer Wang and escort officers Wang, Yan, and Liu, as well as nine soldiers, accompanied the wheel under the guidance of the icebreaker "Beiji No. 1." It arrived outside Yingkou Port on the 27th and dropped anchor. Since leaving Huludao, it has been trying to contact the Yingkou radio station, but to no avail. At 18:20, it received a telegram from the Huludao Port Headquarters: "Quickly enter Yingkou Port." At 6:03 on the 28th, it weighed anchor and entered the port. At 10:00, because the Liao River was thick with ice (about six or seven feet thick), it could not move forward. At the No. 4 shore marker, it slowed down and maintained contact with the stern of the Beiji. Director Zhao and two escort officers first landed. At 13:30, it was discovered that there were more than 20 unknown troops with guns monitoring the area three miles to the right. After 14:00, a large number of unknown troops came, led by Director Zhao and others, and set up posts next to the ship. The wheel suspected the situation and only ordered Director Zhao to board the ship, but to no avail. Director Zhao boarded the "Beiji." At 14:30, the wheel took advantage of the low tide to reverse and turn around to withdraw and await orders. However, at the same time, gunfire erupted, focusing on the wheel. After a few minutes, the "Beiji" overtook the bow and Director Zhao used the radio telephone to order it to stop immediately, otherwise it would continue to fire. Liaison Officer Wang still believed that it was our army on the shore, because the need for food was urgent, so he took this action. He ordered the people on the ship to rest assured and forced the ship to stop, and then it ran aground on the ice. At 14:50, escort officer Yan and "Division Commander Wang" (Communist bandits) led the troops and boarded the ship via the "Beiji." After talking with "Division Commander Wang," it was learned that they had become prisoners. The ship's radio station was forcibly stopped from working, and at the same time, various public and private goods on the ship were seized. At 17:00, the unloading of rice and ammunition began.</p>
<p>Forced to Sail to Dalian</p>
<p>On the 29th, telegraph operator Lu Jiazhen was first taken ashore under escort. At the same time, Liaison Officer Wang and three escort officers and nine soldiers were also taken away from the ship under escort. At 17:50, under the surveillance of the Communist bandits, it was led by the Communist bandits to sail away from Yingkou, passing through Fuzhou Bay to Dalian. Later, because the "Beiji" was trapped by ice, the ship returned to Yingkou and continued to unload rice under duress. At 11:50 on March 1, it was again forced to leave Yingkou for Dalian. At 13:40, it anchored at the third buoy outside Yingkou due to insufficient tide. At that time, it was the first time that it was scouted from the air by our military aircraft, which then flew away. At the same time, the wheel's mate, Sun Jibo, suffered a nervous breakdown due to the threat of the Communist bandits. Later, it continued to sail. At midnight, because the sea surface was thick with ice, the ship could not move forward, so the "Beiji" ordered it to return to Yingkou. At 8:04 on the 2nd, it went to Yingkou again to unload rice. At 14:20, it was bombed by our military aircraft. The main mast was hit and destroyed, and the rear part caught fire. The Communist bandit captain stationed on the ship saw the thick smoke and ordered all the Communist bandits to leave the ship and go ashore. Eleven sailors, two waiters, and the mate (due to nervous breakdown) also landed with the Communist bandits. At 14:30, the Communist bandits left.</p>
<p>Escape from Fire</p>
<p>When putting out the fire, the crew saw an opportunity and tried to put out the fire on the one hand, and retreated at full speed regardless of the Communist bandit's intensive artillery fire. At that time, the steering gear was damaged by the bombing, the circuit was broken, and it was no longer effective. Fortunately, the two main engines, the lighting engine, and the gyrocompass were not damaged. Therefore, the direction was controlled by the front and rear operation of the two main engines. Unfortunately, at 15:25, it ran aground on the third buoy in the port channel due to insufficient tide. At 15:50, it was bombed by our military aircraft again. The large cabin was hit and the gasoline was burned. Machine guns kept firing. As a result, three pipe technicians, Qiu Renji (from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, 24 years old), Chen Yutang, (from Hankou, Hubei, 26 years old), waiter Zhou Shigen, (from Fenghua, Zhejiang, 33 years old), and sailor Ma Baohua, (from Tianjin, 22 years old) were all killed by the bombing while putting out the fire. Carpenter Wang Yongfa, laundry worker He Shifu, and waiter Zhang Yingzhou were also seriously injured while putting out the fire. Third Mate Xie Fengze and waiter Chen Chuzhou were also slightly injured? At 17:40, it escaped danger due to the rising tide. In the dangerous situation of being unfamiliar with the port channel, having no helmsmen or sailors, and leaking in the front cabin, fortunately, all the survivors were determined to coexist with the ship and had the perseverance to do what was known to be impossible. Under the spirit of overall cooperation, they worked all night and finally escaped the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>Naval Escort</p>
<p>At 4:05 on the 3rd, it was discovered by the Yongding. Because it was unclear about the real situation of the ship, it opened fire and shot. The kitchen was hit first, but fortunately the bullet did not explode and there were no casualties. Otherwise, the result would have been unimaginable. At that time, all the employees thought that it was the Communist bandits driving the "Beiji" in, and they were disheartened and intended to commit suicide. At 6:01, the Yongding ship's lights were discovered, and all the employees clapped their hands and cheered, and were revived. At 11:50, two naval officers boarded the ship for inspection and inquired about the truth. On the afternoon of the 4th, under the protection of the Yongding warship, it was towed by the Jiping tugboat and brought to Huludao on the 5th. On the morning of the 7th at 6:00, it was towed by the Jiping wheel and sailed to Tanggu, arriving at 2:50 PM on the 8th to enter the dock for repairs. (Our reporter Li Shaolin)</p>

<h3>鄖縣同鄉控金德配　並呈請嚴懲何承浩</h3>
<p>[Wuchang, 14th by Air Mail] The fellow villagers association from Yun County in northern Hubei Province in this area stated that He Chenghao, the speaker of the county council and deputy commander of the People's Self-Defense Force in the county, took advantage of the name of defending the local area to control the military and financial power, forcibly concentrating materials, hoarding hundreds of billions of cash, and abandoning his post to flee when the bandits approached, plunging the 360,000 county residents into a deep abyss. Today, they specially received reporters to recount the various crimes of He Chenghao. In addition to submitting a request to the military authorities for strict punishment and revocation of He Chenghao's qualifications as a representative of the National Assembly, they also sent representatives to Beijing to petition and called on people from all walks of life to provide righteous support. According to the person in charge of the fellow villagers association, since September of last year, when Chen bandits invaded, County Magistrate Lu Shenggui also served as commander of the Self-Defense Force, and County Council Speaker He Chenghao also served as deputy commander, and mobilized more than 2,000 self-defense team members and guns from various villages into the city. He himself claimed to be the chairman of the Self-Defense Funds Committee and the chairman of the City Defense Donation Committee, and he plundered on a large scale, putting everything into his own pocket. The city defense donations alone amounted to more than 20 billion yuan. On December 27 of last year, Kong Congzhou, a bandit from Yunxi, launched an attack on Lang County. When the emergency was only forty miles away from the county seat, He Chenghao, who held great power, took the opportunity to leave the city for Anyangkou (45 li east of the city) on the morning of the 28th, claiming that he was in a bad mood. By 2:00 PM the next afternoon, the county government had quietly withdrawn, and the teams crossed the river one after another. Suddenly, there was great chaos in the city, and they scrambled to cross the Han River to escape. At that time, the ships under the river were occupied by the teams, resulting in a tragic incident of the military and civilians competing to cross the river. Countless people drowned or were shot to death, and the screams shook the sky, which was unbearable to hear. He watched across the river as the materials in the city were used by the bandits. On January 2 of this year, the bandits broke through the river defense, and the teams collapsed and fled. Government personnel and people fled for their lives, and many abandoned their children on the way, leaving them to their fate. The person in charge finally said that Jin Depei was a subordinate of He Shuihao and was appointed as the general commander of the river defense. He has been handed over to the Hubei Security Command for punishment. He Chenghao is still in Hankou, running around to get Jin acquitted. The association is asking the government to punish him.</p>

The authorities dispatched a team to encircle and suppress them. The bandits were unable to resist and fled back to the original ship and sailed south. On the 14th, the authorities received information again that seven or eight bandits had been found in Qianbujing Qiaoxiang on the Songfeng border. The county government immediately dispatched a security team and the Zhuangxing Wuqiao and other township self-defense teams to encircle and suppress them. The bandits immediately fled west across the river (Huangpu River) upon hearing the news. On the 15th, it was reported again that the bandits had appeared. The authorities dispatched a team again to search. It is reported that the bandits may be the remnants of Ding Xisan, such as Li Baoshan, who are hiding in the Songfeng border.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Songjiang, 15th] On the morning of the 14th, more than 20 bandits were found in Zhangjiatang, two miles away from Yexie Town in the county. They were holding rifles and hand grenades. The Yexie Self-Defense Team rushed to suppress them. Pan, the district chief of the Punan District Office, also led the Tinglin Security Team and the Self-Defense Team, and the Wangyang Self-Defense Team, to encircle and suppress them. No trace of the bandits was found when the search reached Yanduntou. Another message said that the bandits had fled to Taiping Bridge on the Songfeng border and were hiding.

<h3>Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute Completes Two Experiments</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Chengdu, 12th] Yang Xingrong and Ku Rongxi, staff members of the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute's Serum Factory, have been researching domestic animal pathology and various antitoxic serums for many years. Recently, they have collaborated with people in the factory to complete two extremely valuable experiments: (1) An efficacy experiment on bovine plague organ seedlings made from bovine lungs. This experiment is of great economic significance. Compared with the bovine plague organ seedlings made from spleen tissue and lymph nodes that were commonly used in the past, the cost is only half as much, but the efficacy is more than doubled. (2) Anthrax bacillus virulence test. This experiment is of great value in terms of academic theory. According to the unanimous view of the medical academic circles in the past, injecting bacteria into the blood vessels of domestic animals would be more toxic than subcutaneous injection, but the result of this experiment is just the opposite. It is inferred that the toxicity of anthrax bacillus to the domestic animal body is not in secreting toxins, but in the collective blocking of microvessels, which is a major revolution in veterinary medicine.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The midterm exams for the last semester at Jiaotong University were completed today.

Yesterday, the Cotton Yarn Market Was Affected by Tight Credit, With Many in the Industry Experiencing Tight Cash Flow. Sales to Other Ports Became Stagnant, and Local Manufacturers Adopted a Wait-and-See Attitude, Leading to a Sudden Decline in Morale. The Market Opened With a Wave of Selling, and Speculators Took the Opportunity to Act, Causing Prices of All Yarns to Open Lower. Forty-Two Count Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Was Offered at 175 Million, and Twenty-One Count Double Horse at 97 Million, Causing the Market to Suddenly Become Oversupplied.

Dyeing Factories Showed Little Interest, and Although Retail Investors Still Tried to Struggle, They Were Unable to Support the Prices Due to Excessive Pressure.

Buyers, Aware That Sales in This City and the Suzhou-Wuxi Area Were Good and That Demand From French Africa Was Urgent, Paid High Prices. Transactions Increased, Prices Soared, and the Market Base Was Very Solid, With Continued Prospects for Growth. According to Industry Insiders, the New Dragon Well Tea Crop, Which Is Closely Watched by Shops in This City, Is Currently Being Produced in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province.

<p>Literary Reunion: Movie Script (6) Zhang Dao-lu. He Qi: Of Course I Wouldn't Do That, But No Matter What, I Will Never Forget You in This Lifetime! Jingye: Why Be So Stubborn? A Man Should Be Able to Pick Things Up and Put Them Down. As Long as You Can Raise Xiuzhen Well, You'll Be Doing Right by Me. Okay, Go! Please Don't Come See Me Again. He Qi: (Reluctantly Gets Up to Leave.) I Beg You to See Me One More Time at Least. Jingye: Impossible! You Know I Always Do What I Say. Please Leave! (He Qi Walks Away Depressed.) (After He Qi Leaves, Jingye First Sits on the Sofa Staring Blankly at the Sky Outside the Window and Cries. Then, He Can't Help but Lean on the Sofa and Sob Loudly and Cry.) 40. He Qi's Living Room. Two Days After Canyun Holds a Banquet and He Qi Returns Home. Canyun and Xiuzhen Sit on a Sofa in the Living Room, Flipping Through a Photo Album. This Album Was Brought Back by He Qi From Southeast Asia. Inside Are Many Landscape Paintings and Character Photos From Southeast Asia. Suddenly, They Flip to a Photo of an Infant. (It's the Same as the One Taken of Xiuzhen a Few Weeks After She Was Born.) She Points It to Xiuzhen to See. Canyun: Xiuzhen, Look, This Is a Photo of You When You Were Little. If Your Father Hadn't Taken It to Southeast Asia, We Wouldn't Have It Anymore. Xiuzhen: Xiuzhen (Looks Closely, Hesitates.) Mom, Is This a Photo of Me? Canyun: Yes, When This Photo Was Taken, You Were Less Than a Month Old. Xiuzhen: Mom, Why Is This Exactly the Same as One at Mr. Zheng's House? Canyun: (Finds It Strange.) What? Mr. Zheng Has One Just Like This? You Must Be Mistaken. It Can't Be the Same. Xiuzhen: Mom, I'm Not Mistaken. The Clothes Worn by the Child in This Photo Are Exactly the Same, and It Was Also Taken by "Wenhua Photography Studio." Canyun: Whose Photo Is Mr. Zheng's One? Xiuzhen: She Said It Was a Photo of Her Friend's Daughter. Canyun: (Can't Help but Be Suspicious.) Xiuzhen, Mr. Zheng's One Can't Be the Same as This One. Don't Talk Nonsense. (After Saying This, She Puts the Photo Album on a Table.) Xiuzhen: Mom, If You Don't Believe Me, I'll Go to Mr. Zheng's Place Tomorrow to Get It for You to See. Canyun: It Doesn't Matter If They Look Alike or Not. You're Not Allowed to Go to Mr. Zheng's Place to Say That. Xiuzhen: Then You Don't Believe Me. Canyun: It Doesn't Matter Whether I Believe You or Not. Go Upstairs and Write. Let Me Rest for a While. (Xiuzhen Goes Upstairs. Canyun First Sits on the Sofa in a Daze. Suddenly, She Gets Up Again to Take a Look at the Photo Album. Then, She Puts It Down. She's Very Impatient in the Living Room. She's Restless. After a While, She Sits Back on the Sofa. She Recalls How She Got Xiuzhen Back Then. How She First Met Jingye, and All the Mysterious Impressions of He Qi Meeting Jingye. Scene After Scene Quickly Passes Through Her Mind. She's About to Tearfully Break Down. Suddenly, He Qi Returns, Interrupting Her Memories.) He Qi: (Sees Canyun With a Very Resentful Look. It Seems He Can Tell She's Just Cried.) Yun, What's Wrong? Why Are You Unhappy? Canyun: (Forcing a Smile.) I'm Not Unhappy About Anything. I Was Just Going to Ask You, When You Came Home the Other Night, You Were So Happy When You First Saw Xiuzhen. Why Did You Suddenly Change Later? For the Last Two Days, Everyone Can Tell You're Lost in Thought. What's Really on Your Mind? Or Are You Facing Any Difficulties? He Qi: (Forcing a Smile.) Yun, Why Do You Think That Way? I'm Really Just Too Tired. There's Nothing on My Mind. Canyun, Qi, You Don't Have to Hide It From Me. You're in Pain, You're Confused, You Don't Know What to Do, Right? He Qi: (Getting Anxious) I Don't Know What You're Talking About? I'm Not Hiding Anything From You. Canyun: (Angrily) You Used to Treat Me Like an Idiot. You've Kept This Secret From Me All These Years. But Now Is the Time for You to Tell Me the Truth. He Qi: (Getting Even More Anxious) What Are You Talking About? What Secret? Canyun: (Firmly) Qi, Calm Down, Okay? If You Tell Me the Truth, We Can Discuss Anything. If You Don't Tell Me, Then Don't Blame Me. He Qi: I Have Nothing to Say. Canyun: I Think You Should Tell Me. She's Grown Up Now. If You Don't Make Things Clear, It Won't Be Good for Her Either. He Qi: (Looking Like He's About to Explode With Anger) Not Good for Whom? Canyun: Xiuzhen! He Qi: What Does This Have to Do With Xiuzhen? Canyun: Of Course It's Related. You Should Also Think About Jingye. He Qi: What Does This Have to Do With Zheng Jingye? Why Did You Bring Her Up? Canyun: Don't I Have a Reason to Mention Her? He Qi: What Reason Do You Have? Canyun: Xiuzhen's Biological Mother Is Zheng Jingye! She's Not Dead! He Qi: (Loudly With Anger and Rage) Who Told You This Nonsense? Canyun: (Suddenly Turns Gentle) Qi, You Know in Your Heart That This Isn't Nonsense, but the Truth. (Saying This, She Walks to He Qi's Side and Comforts Him.) As Long as You Admit It, I Won't Only Not Make Things Difficult for You, but Also Willingly Help You Overcome Your Difficulties. Do You Believe Me? (She Stares at He Qi Face to Face. He Qi Is Moved and Reluctantly Acknowledges It. He Doesn't Say a Word.) Come Here and Rest Quietly for a While. (He Qi Is Extremely Touched. He Looks at Her With Tears in His Eyes.) 41. Zheng Jingye's Living Room. Maid: I Told Mrs. He That You Were Busy and Couldn't Receive Her. She Said She Had Something Urgent That She Had to Discuss With You in Person. Jingye: (Worried, Hesitates for a Moment.) Please Ask Her to Come In. (The Servant Retires. After a While, the Servant Leads Mrs. He Into the Living Room. The Servant Then Leaves.) Canyun: (Steps Forward to Shake Hands With Jingye. Jingye Forcibly Smiles to Greet Her.) Mr. Zheng, I'm Really Sorry to Bother You Like This. But This Matter Has to Be Discussed With You in Person. Jingye: It Doesn't Matter. Please Sit Down. (Canyun Chooses a Chair and Sits Down. Jingye Also Sits Down on a Chair Nearby.) Canyun: It's Really a Coincidence. If It Weren't for Xiuzhen, We Probably Would Never Have Met. And You Probably Wouldn't Have Met He Qi Again. Jingye: (Wants to Answer, but Doesn't Know What to Say for a Moment, and Feels Quite Embarrassed. Canyun Continues.) Canyun: I Not Only Want to Thank You for Saving Xiuzhen, but Also Want to Thank You for Giving Xiuzhen to Me Back Then. I Raised Her, and I Got a Lot of Happiness and Comfort. Jingye: (Hearing This, Can't Help but Be Surprised. Of Course She Knows That Canyun's Words Have a Meaning. But She Still Hopes Canyun Won't Talk Anymore.) Mrs. He! I Really Don't Understand What You Mean by These Words. Canyun: You Love Xiuzhen Very Much, and I Also Love Xiuzhen Very Much. Now, Because of Xiuzhen, I Want to Talk to You About a Solution. But I Don't Have Bad Intentions, So Please Don't Misunderstand Me. Jingye: (Looks at Canyun With Great Unease, Feeling Mysteriously Disturbed.) Canyun: (Calmly, but Not Maliciously.) Mr. Zheng! I Know Everything About Your Relationship With He Qi and Xiuzhen's Background. Jingye: (Can't Endure It Anymore.) Mrs. He! What Are You Talking About?...I Canyun: He Qi Has Never Told Me the Truth. But Now There Is All The Evidence, and He Can't Deny It Either. Jingye: (Feeling Extremely Embarrassed, Hating He Qi in Her Heart.) Whether He Admits It or Denies It, What Do You Mean by Saying These Things to Me? Canyun: You Know That Ever Since He Qi Met You the Other Night, He's Been Listless All Day, Suffering and Confused, Restless. I'm Afraid He'll Cause Some Trouble. Jingye: How Can You Blame Me for That? Canyun: No One Is Blaming You, But We Have to Calmly Think of a Solution. Jingye: Think of What Solution? Canyun: I've Thought About It Again and Again, and There's No Good Solution. Now, the Only Thing I Can Do Is Leave He Qi So That He Can Be With You. Maybe That Can Save Him. It Would Be Even Better If Xiuzhen Was Raised by You. What Do You Think? Jingye: (Getting a Little Angry.) Mrs. He, If You're Here to Test Me, Please Don't Bother. If You're Sincere, I'm Sorry, but I Can't Accept It. Canyun: I'm Being Very Sincere. Please Don't Doubt Me. I Hope You Accept My Proposal. Jingye: If I Were Going to Do That, I Would Have Destroyed Someone Else's Family Ten Years Ago! Canyun: If You Had Wanted to Do That Ten Years Ago, You Might Not Have Succeeded. Jingye: Then Why Are You Forcing Me to Do That Now? Canyun: Because the Situation Is Very Different Now. For the Past Ten Years, I've Gotten His "Person," But I Haven't Gotten His "Heart." You Haven't Gotten His "Person," But You've Gotten His "Heart." I Really Don't Want to Live This Kind of Nominal Married Life Anymore. So I Hope That for the Sake of He Qi, for the Sake of Xiuzhen, You'll Accept My Solution. Jingye: No Matter What, I Can't Accept It. Speaking of Zhen, We Can't Do That Even More. Canyun: Why? Jingye: Because We Can't Make an Innocent Child Doubt Her Background and Be Negatively Affected. Canyun: But She's Already Starting to Doubt. Jingye: That Doesn't Matter. As Long as Everyone Insists That You're Her Real Mother, That's Fine. Canyun: Then What About He Qi? What Will Happen If Things Continue Like This? Jingye: Please Tell Him Not to Let His Mind Wander Anymore. One Mistake Is Enough. A Woman Sacrificed Half Her Life for Him. He Shouldn't Be Selfish and Have Her Sacrifice the Second Half of Her Life for Him. Canyun: I Hope You'll Consider It Carefully. Jingye: I Very Firmly Don't Want to Consider This Solution. Canyun: Won't You Think About It for Xiuzhen's Sake? Jingye: For Xiuzhen's Sake, It's Best to Make Her Believe That You're Her Biological Mother. (Just as She's Saying This, Mrs. Zheng Returns. After Everyone Greets Each Other, Canyun Takes Her Leave. Jingye Feels Very Painful.) Mrs. Zheng: Sister, What Did Mrs. He Come to Talk About? What Made You Unhappy Again?</p>
