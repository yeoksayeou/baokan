<p>〔本報蚌埠二十日電〕徐州東翼殘匪仍負隅頑抗，戰事膠着中。刻國軍求一鼓殲滅共匪主力，共匪則拖延時間，希冀將其主力逃避於包圍圈外，故宿縣附近戰事已成此度大會戰中之最後關鍵。國軍自豫南東進之黃維兵團，擁有精兵十五萬人以上，於日前進駐蒙城後，今已抵達西寺　以南之龍王廟附近，連日宿縣地區間匪軍劉伯承部之三縱隊，陳毅部之兩廣及第八縱隊，於宿縣南北趕築工事，其目的似在阻止黃兵團之北上。又，蚌埠當面戰事仍在任橋以北進行中，自葫盧島南撤之國軍昨過此間北開。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕若干官方人士預料，杜魯門總統於廿二日與國務卿馬歇爾檢討外交政策後，可能發表一項聲明，重申中美之聯繫並强調美政府之關懷中國危機。但一般認為，此項聲明措詞必十分審慎，以避免有全面援助蔣總統或使美國對中國有肯定義務之任何暗示。傳蔣總統致杜魯門之函內要求：（一）美國宣佈支持其對共黨作戰。（二）從速增加軍事援助。（三）保證大量援助將繼續數年之久，同時在巴黎方面宣佈，馬歇爾將於二十一日返華府，與正由基威斯特銷假返來之杜魯門會晤。</p>

<p>美使館發言人吿外記者</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿日電〕可靠方面廿日息：美國駐華代表間對最近期內之美國對華政策，已發生意見上之分裂，海空軍代表與國務院及陸軍代表觀點完全不同。美大使館發言人廿日吿合衆社稱，外傳意見分歧一節不確，國務院及三軍駐華代表「對美國對華政策意見完全一致。」然所謂分歧之中心，在於是否仍能及時全面援助中國，而挽救危亡，另由華盛頓高級人員發表政策宣言，表明「決不坐視」之態度，抑或援助縱多已無濟於事。消息靈通人士稱：從西太平洋司令白吉爾海軍中將之言論測之，海軍之見解與空軍一致。彼等之觀點，亦卽周以德所領導之美議員集團之意見，厥爲中國與反共國家休戚相關，故應以全力援助中國，而增長其實力。此項理論之基礎，厥爲蔣總統乃中國之唯一有力反共核心，如蔣總統引退，而由「聯合」政府上台，則共產黨可以氣指頤使，而美國之全球防共政策將遭遇莫大之挫折。另一方面，國務院及陸軍（後者以美國顧問團長巴大維少將爲代表），據稱支持馬歇爾國務卿之政策，而認爲中國已無可救藥，美國祗好不得已求其次。據悉：當地經合署職員亦贊成此論，以爲援助縱多，中國政府仍將瓦解。彼等之見解爲：美國應力爭有利地位，俾仍能影響後日之政府，支持非共產份子之加入「聯合」內閣。</p>

<h3 id="c22">關於進出口貿易的管制 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 諫初</p>
<p>讀本報十一月十六日社論「發展進出口貿易」一文，歸納其要點：（一）政府對出口商應放寬一切貸款及鼓勵輸出；（二）政府對進出口所需與所得之外匯，不必加以管制，並聽任其無限制進口；（三）政府祗核定進口貨品，其他均不必加以過問。以上各點，言之似皆成理，但一按實際，誠有不能已於言者，請爲分陳之如次。</p>
<p>第一，按我國向爲入超國，尤其在勝利復員以後，入超情勢，日趨嚴重；旣不能量入爲出，在輸入方面，自不能不有數値的限制。此在戰後英國，加拿大等，均有此種管制，不獨我國一國爲然，輸入旣有數値的限制，不能盡量供應，國內需要爲維持全部工商業的存在，必須求得均平，不能使某貨輸入太多，某貨輸入太少，一部份工商業獲得優厚供應，一部份則遭受重大打擊。事後調節糾正，已屬過遲，此爲輸入數値限制以後，必須有分類輸入限額制度之由來也。</p>
<p>第二，旣有輸入限額，卽不可不有限額之分配，蓋各類貨品之輸入限額，係估計全國需要，考慮訂定，若不作公平合理之分配，則各地各業，捷足者先得，後來者見遺，前者原料過剩，後者缺料停工，造成紛亂之局面，無法再予補救，其不平莫甚於此，此爲有輸入限額制度以後，必須有限額分配之理由也。</p>
<p>第三，原文亦承認政府須核定進口貨品，但不必再過問其他，不知輸入限額旣不可少，政府卽不能僅以規定何者可進口，何者不得進口爲了事，必須進一步加以分配，不使一方得優厚供應，一方受重大打擊，而後方可免除巧取豪奪之弊；否則其後果不堪設想矣。</p>
<p>至在限額分配之技術方面，更有非外界人士所盡能瞭解者，茲再擇要述之如次：</p>
<p>（一）目前輸入限額之分配，已全部或大部分以工廠與實際用戶爲對象，其中如硫化元原料，生橡膠，檾蔴，白報紙，捲烟紙，木漿，烟葉，烟梗，羊毛，紗綫等，均全部配與工廠用戶，油脂臘化學品，金屬品，蔴袋，拷皮膏，染料等，均大部分配與工廠用戶，其不能直接配與工廠用戶之貨品，除各種油料，由汽柴油分配委員會，另訂用戶分配辦法外，其他貨品進口商所得極少數配額，亦均須按照規定，先售與各種用戶，或批發商人，提供售貨合同，經買方公會證明以後，方得申請輸入。譬如以白報紙言，自管制以來，各報館卽憑用戶資格，直接獲得應有之配額，各用戶旣未「受到無窮的剝削」，亦未嘗「給特殊階級的中外商人以發財的機會」；以此例彼，各業皆然，無待煩言也。</p>
<p>（二）上述工廠用戶限額之分配，無不由民間工商團體協助辦理，並由各受配用戶，一一簽章認可，方予核配，在如此複雜之環境中，欲求理想公平，自不易辦到。然自實行以來，承各業工商團體之協助，與不斷之改進，尙少不滿之處，若稱特殊階級從中漁利，取得不應有之配額，則在多　　視之下，自非事實所可能。</p>
<p>（三）限額配給工廠用戶以來，尙有一點，更爲外界所不甚明瞭者，卽除數値上得到較合理公允之分配外，各項貨品之品質種類，亦均可由工廠用戶自行選擇，如某廠配得某項金屬品限額三千美元，究竟應輸入何種品質何種尺寸之金屬物料，可由工廠自定，以符實際需要。故於「數値管制」之外，尙收「品質管制」之效。若無前項限額分配制度，則任何人均可自由輸入，其輸入物品輒以個人利益爲前提，不以配合生產需要爲依據，流弊所及，外匯已先消耗，供應則仍失調。若待發生困雞而始加以糾正，則政府與人民之損失，已均不可計數矣。</p>
<p>査輸管會職掌進出口貿易管理兩年來，對於限額分配及貿易管理工作，實已盡最大努力，似已無負其使命。然機構應否撤銷，乃屬事權問題，而非貿易管理問題。若貿易仍有管理之必要，則輸管會辦也可，由其他機構辦理也可，均不能超越現實，求取成功。故筆者對此事權問題，視爲無足重輕，非本文討論之點。</p>

<p>自由談鄉土觀念  雷霆　　我們江南各省的人民，也許因與生活的自然環境得天獨厚之故，養成了愛靜不愛動的生活習慣，遵守傳統，傾向保守，祗要日子還能勉强過得下去，誰都抱着「一動不如一靜」的想法，一直能在一個狹隘的圈子內生活下去。尤其像蘇錫一帶，當地人祖孫三代可在一條街道上住下數十年，在一個茶館裏消磨下一生。對於生長在那邊的朋友，那怕已經十年不見面，你逕可往他的舊居訪問，不僅門牆依舊，就連室內的情調和擺設，似亦沒有甚麼大的變動。　　我國農業社會的基本性格，自然是促使人民趨於保守生活的王要原因之一。農民固不能離開其土地，就是地主也不便長久離開其土地所在地的區城，這一如寄生虫不能離開母體一樣。其他工商各業，雖然比較富於流動性　但農業社會所特有的鄉土觀念，最後仍會把他們吸着到他出身的土地上面來的。「衣錦榮歸」的觀念，不僅出身農村社會的人破除不了，且可說是普世人羣的共同心理。榮德生之於無錫，杜　門之於米蘇里，史太林之於喬治亞，雖然各人的表現方式不同，其鄉土觀念却是一樣的。　　在一個生活相當安定的社會中，不論此種社會的制度如何，人們總希望有一個心理上的歸宿、而家鄕觀念就最能適於這種要　。家鄕觀念實在是一種不易解　的存在。在我們江南各地，因爲自然條件優異，生長在此的人民、朝夕生活於斯，不知不覺之中，與其生長所在的土地化爲一體了。但在有些地方，自然生活條件並不優異，或生活的傳統習　習於冒險好動，例如閩粤各地出身的華僑，故鄉對於他們，也許助力不多，似乎無所留戀之處。然而事實上華僑却正是最富鄕土觀念的人，他們之中雖有從未一至故鄉的，但終其一身，無不以鄕土爲念。現在南洋各地多有　華風氣，據說理由無他，就是因爲華僑們始終不肯歸化於其所在地的國家，那怕已經在彼成家立業，而迄未動搖其鄕土的愛戀觀念。　　這種觀念決不能僅以農業社　的經濟條件加以解釋，而且也不能單以血緣的觀念加以解釋。在現代國家中，美國可說是一個民族的大雞鍋。世界人種在美國殆可說都有其代表在，雖在比例上以歐洲白種人佔優勢。民族的歧視觀念，在美國也可說是比較最淡薄，可是美國的人民一樣的具有鄕土觀念，在此次世界大戰中，所有在國外陣亡的美國將兵，幾全都送給死者本鄕埋葬。美國軍隊中且專門有一個陣亡將士登記組織，專負至各地搜索美軍陣亡將士遺體之責。前年爲搜索川康內地的美國空軍人員，美軍陣亡將士登記組織且不惜歷盡千辛萬苦的派負親往搜索，雖結果並無所獲，但也足證美國人的鄉十觀念是怎樣的嚴重了。　　在抗戰時期中，我國人民始經歷了一次可說空前的大遷移。但在戰爭結束後，凡有家鄉可歸的，仍都回到故鄕，雖然不是每個人都是衣錦榮歸，但至少都是有鄕可歸，縱不一定有家可歸。　　鄕土觀念的產生旣非經濟制度或社會制度所可解釋，也不是單純的血緣思想所能解釋，則必然產生於渾然一體的國族思想。地不分東西，國不分大小，國族思想總是結合一個固定地域人民的最大力量。英語中的Nation一字，雖可解作民族，亦可解作國家，但實在則是綜兩者爲一的國族。鄉土觀念就是國族觀念的一環。離開了國族，鄉土觀念是不能存在的。猶太人復國之所以必須回到巴勒斯坦，必須以以色列爲國號者，正就是一個現實的說明。　　然而現在呈現於我們眼前的，却又是一幅背鄕離井的流民圖。難道在猶太人方吿復國的今日，要輪着我們來做猶太人第二嗎？但我相信以我國人民國族思想之深，鄕土觀念之厚，是決不至於如此的—除了已經預定了明年飛機票的那一些人！「不曉得」  談客　　「知之爲知之，不知爲不知。」由於不知道而說「不曉得」，原無可非議，然而這句話在我聽來，很有些刺耳之感。　　某天，去訪候一位朋友，按址前往，很有禮貌地叩了一回門。門開處，一位素昧平生的小姐在向我打量，我則點頭如儀，含笑奉詢：「此地是×××先生嗎？」小姐略一停頓，說聲「不曉得！」乒的一聲，門就關上了。裏邊是不是有一副「柳眉倒豎杏眼圓靜」的容貌，我不知道；外邊的我却弄得莫名其妙，進退兩難。好容易從老遠尋到了這兒，指望的是一聲「不曉得」麽？　　過幾天，去訪而未晤的朋友來看我，談起上次的事，他笑起來了；　　「那座房子裏住着六七個單位，相互間永遠保持着陌路人的狀態。我住的是亭子間，打後門出進，你去前門問詢，自然回答你一聲不曉得了。」聽了朋友這一席話，才恍然大悟，不禁脫口說出二句話：「別有天地前後門，六七單位陌路人！」相與大笑。以上是我碰「不曉得」釘子的經過。下面要說的跟以上全然不同。　　哥哥自歐陸來信，談赴歐途中船泊錫蘭西岸哥侖布港上岸遊覽的情形說：「這裏的人很客氣，向他们問路，他們會很和氣的作詳細指示，甚至會送你到達目的地。和他們相處，眞有一家人之惑。」好個「一家人！」跟我們這個「不曉得」放在一起多觸目呀！不禁興起一種悠然之思來了。酒話  陳詒先　　十一月十五日新聞報新園林上有烟橋兄作「　遊一日」一文，內言「王四酒家松菌小而嫰，甚雋。惜白酒已罄，新釀未熟，所飲者爲黃酒，有甜味，殊暴。如君左復來，當亦與余同有今昔之感。」　　日前有蘇州友人來函，約去看天平紅葉，吃陽澄湖蟹，余以蘇州無好酒，竟鼓不起興致。酒之魔力最大，有好酒之東道主人，雖其菜肴略差，亦欣然赴會。蓋酒徒所法重者在酒，有好酒，一盤發芽豆，一包油氽果肉，卽可吃得滿意。（酒菜另爲一種，如醉蟹，糟蛋，風乾栗之類，最佳，可以吃一塊豆腐干，幾顆花生米，而不必吃魚翅海參。）十七日余敎書歸，有打門而入者，搬進老酒一罎，係章雲生兄贈我者，馬上開飲，香而醉，眞山陰產也。近日西北風起，正蟹肥之時，每日買尖團各一，蒸而下酒，夭下之美味，無以易之。　　莊子達生篇內言：「夫醉者之墜車，雖疾不死，骨節與人同，而犯害與人異，其神全也。乘亦不知也，墜亦不知也。」此醉者之一境界也。九月十七夕余在愼利酒號吃陳威司格，貪杯大醉，主人雲生兄派車送余歸，眞有「乘亦不知也」之况。水滸上寫武松醉打蔣门神，中有曰：「武松又行不到三四里，再吃過十來碗酒，此時已有午牌時分，天色正熱，却有點微風。」此半醉者之一境界也。施耐庵寫武松吃酒，不言其醉，却寫有點微風，寫半醉眞入木三分，沙到極點。　　民十四年紹興友人邵資生嫁女，余坐公路汽車往賀之，寓其單醪河宅中，得交陳叔泉，人稱爲三店王，藏有數十年陳酒，約余飲其家，其酒芳冽而醇厚已極，與昔在北平所飲旗门出售之酒相同。三日後返杭，渡錢塘江時，衣袖間所留酒香，飄拂於面，此時始悟施耐庵以微風二字狀微醺之妙也。　　紹興舊家有好酒，其家製之酒菜，如靑魚乾，蚶子，尤爲他處所無。水澄巷有一茶食店（忘其字號）售桂花蛋捲，酒後吃數捲，勝於西菜肆之中巧格力。今日之我  吳庸　　今日我國的大多數人一方面是在怨尤——怨尤自己以外的某些人。怨尤是把責任推向他人身上去。在怨尤他人的心理之下，個人是喪失了效用。　　今日我國的大多數人另一方面又是在期待——期待盛世的蒞臨。這是把希望寄託於將來。在期待「將來」的心理之下，「今日」便成爲不値一顧。　　在怨尤與期待的雙重心理之下，今日的個人勢必一無可爲，只好袖手旁觀，聽天由命。　　我素信一國的文化，武化，或腐化，是全體人民的總成績。成非一人之力，敗亦未必是一人之過。有功，人人都有一份光榮；有過，人人都有一份責任。　　我素信今日的狀况，目前的局勢，是過去歷史的延續。成固非全是今人之力，敗亦不便全怪今日的人。有功，古人與今人同有一份光榮；有過，古人與今人同有一份責任。　　這樣的想法，無以名之，姑名之曰「整體主義」。橫的方面，人與人間是一個不可分的整體。縱的方面，過去與今日是一個不可分的整體。　　只是所謂「橫的整體」，絕不是指空洞玄虛的「社會」「國家」，而是指你與我及他，是指有肉有血的個人之總和。或謂今日的局面是如此的糟，然而個人確實不曾做過半件壞事，不便代人受過。不曾做壞事？或許是。可是至少足下朱曾阻止他人作惡是實。容許他人作惡，甘心忍之受之，其罪過初不减於作惡。大家不容許一人作惡，試問其惡又將從何作起？　　我說一部歷史是一個縱的整體，這絕不是說吾人可把一切不是諉諸過去，絕非謂「木已成丹」，只好聽其自然。須知古人可以影饗今人，固矣，但今人亦足以影響後代。有過去之因，始成今日之果，則明日之果有待於今日之因也明矣。試問我們今日是在種些什麼因？　　可見所緊要的是「我」，是「今日」，是「今日之我」。積四億五千萬的「今日之我」，是爲現代的中國。吾人縱不爲非作惡，然人人袖手旁觀，聽天由命，則怨尤的對象何時消除？未來的盛世期於何日。減字木蘭  夏瞿禪　　摩挲黃月，橫理庚庚冰作骨。雷壑焚餘，親見唐巾勘洛書。劍頭餘滴，汗簡丹心應化碧。呵起精魂，猶有蟾蜍古淚痕！小重山　　容易湛冥醉却難，不如留醒眼，看杯翻，冶游天氣一身閑，尋芳約，迤邐又鵑殘。歸興夢都闌，故人餘一諾，各江關；明朝雙燕爲誰還？南樓遠，更遠是南山。社會服務復興中學學生　為市校敎師生活呼籲　　我們的敎師，爲了生活煎追，只得向市府請求緊急救濟，以暫時解決生活問題；因爲不得要領，而至於總請假了。雖然犧牲了我們的學業，但我們站在學生立塲，自應寄予同情，自應予以支持。　　在「敎育第一」的口號下，敎師爲了完成他們神聖的使命，雖然生活日苦一日，而他們在黑板前始終不懈的吸着粉筆灰，堅守着自己的崗位，爲國家敎育第二代的靑年。雖然他們的生活不如工人，更遠不如商人，但是他們爲了責任，就始終忍耐着。　　憶從前同學們爲了敎師淸苦的生活，曾想出辦法予以精神上物質上的安慰，發起尊師運動。但自從幣制改革以後，限價取消以來，物價空前瘋狂上漲；除了少數的豪富之外，多數的人民都過着牛馬不如的艱苦生活，而敎師們的薪水更遠跟不上物價。如其再叫敎師們忍耐，除非是叫他們「敎以待斃」了。　　目下家長們與敎師一樣的淸苦與貧窮，所以雖同情敎師，而無力幫助敎師。今日面臨着如此嚴重的情形，敎師們總請假，學生學業被荒廢。所以我們沈痛地向社會各界人士呼籲，請求正視這嚴重的敎育危機，要求政府當局切實解決敎師生活問題。　　上海市立復興中學同學一百二十人敬啓一一·一九。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Executive Yuan's Temporary Meeting Approves Measures for a Linked Import-Export System: Foreign Exchange Earnings to Be Transferred at Agreed-Upon Prices <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] To encourage exports, improve remittances from overseas Chinese, and gradually balance international receipts and payments, the government has decided to adopt a linked import-export system. The outline of these measures for linked import-export trade, drafted by Finance Minister Xu Kan in Shanghai in consultation with Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun and relevant agencies such as the Export Control Commission, was submitted to the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the 20th for discussion and approval. Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, and Pang Songzhou have been assigned to refine the wording, and the measures may be announced on the 21st. The outline of the linked measures is as follows: (1) Foreign exchange earnings from exports no longer need to be settled with the government and can be transferred in full to importers to pay for imports. (2) The linked import-export system will adopt an indirect linkage system. Foreign exchange earned by exporters will first be transferred to the Central Bank or designated banks, which will issue a foreign exchange transfer certificate. Exporters can sell this certificate to importers at a price agreed upon by both parties, taking into account market prices. (3) Importers who purchase foreign exchange from exporters should use it to import production equipment, machinery, and industrial raw materials, as specified in the permissible import items listed in Appendices (1), (9), (2), and (3). (4) Foreign exchange earned by exporters and transferred to importers must be transferred within two months. (5) After the new measures are announced, the government will no longer supply foreign exchange required by businesses, except for maintaining import quotas. (6) Remittances from overseas Chinese to the country can also be transferred according to the same methods as foreign exchange earned by exporters, with the exchange rate determined by mutual agreement and not calculated according to fixed exchange rates.</p>

<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 20th] Remnant bandits on the eastern flank of Xuzhou are still stubbornly resisting, and the fighting is at a stalemate. At this moment, the National Army seeks to annihilate the main force of the communist bandits in one fell swoop, while the communist bandits are delaying for time, hoping to escape their main force from the encirclement. Therefore, the fighting near Su County has become the final key to this major battle. The Huang Wei Corps of the National Army, advancing from southern Henan, possesses more than 150,000 elite troops. After entering Mengcheng a few days ago, it has now arrived near Longwangmiao, south of Xisi. For days, the 3rd Column of Liu Bocheng's forces and the Liangguang and 8th Columns of Chen Yi's forces have been hastily building fortifications north and south of Su County, seemingly to prevent the Huang Corps from advancing north. Furthermore, the fighting facing Bengbu is still taking place north of Renqiao. National troops withdrawn from Huludao yesterday passed through here heading north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Military News: The northward-bound Huang Corps, with the force of an avalanche, broke through the strong obstacles of the Liu bandits, forcibly crossed the Wo River, and then defeated the stubborn resistance of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Columns of the Liu bandits on the north bank of the Wo River. They continue to advance northward. In this battle, more than 2,000 bandits were killed or wounded, over 800 bandit corpses were left behind, and over 200 bandits were captured. Three mortar cannons, eleven light and heavy machine guns and submachine guns, and over 200 rifles were seized. The remnant bandits are retreating northwest. This is the first victory of the Huang Corps in its northward advance. At the same time, the Li Corps also defeated the Liu bandits' 3rd and 9th Columns attempting to reinforce at Renqiao and is proceeding north at full speed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Bandits who retreated forty li southeast of Xuzhou launched a fierce attack on the National Army in the mountainous area north of Fangcun last night. The Qiu Corps met them head-on and fought fiercely for the positions around Black Mountain, eventually routing the bandits. The bandits suffered over 10,000 casualties. This morning, the bandits regrouped the remnants of the 11th and Shandong Central-South Columns and attempted another counterattack. Under the fierce fire net of the defending troops, they suffered over 2,000 more casualties, and over 50 bandits were captured. The bandits have not yet succeeded. This is the second victory for the Qiu Corps in the southeast of Xuzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 20th] Commander Liu Ruming, who is supervising the battle on the front lines in Bengbu, returned to Bengbu on the 20th to meet with relevant parties regarding the deployment north of Guzhen.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 20th] The Huang Baitao Corps continued to advance eastward across the Grand Canal today.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 20th] The Chen bandit's 1st and 2nd Columns launched a fierce attack on the positions of the Qiu Corps at Zhongshan and Mashan (fifty li east of the city) west of the city on the morning of the 19th. The fierce fighting lasted until 7:00 AM, with over 4,000 bandits killed. At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 20th, the remnant bandits again launched a swift and fierce attack on the National Army's Shengshan position with three regiments. By noon, all three bandit regiments had been annihilated, and a large amount of supplies were seized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announced: The eastward-advancing Li Corps, with the coordination of the air force, artillery, and tanks, launched a fierce pursuit of the remnant bandits of the 10th Column resisting near Daxujia. They captured important strongholds such as Pengjialou and Changjialou, annihilating one bandit regiment. The remaining 150 bandits were all captured. In addition, a large number of bandit troops deployed in depth east of Daxujia were also heavily bombed by the air force. The Huang Corps, firmly holding Nianzhuang, continued to annihilate over 4,000 bandits with the support of the air force. In total, the Huang Corps held Nianzhuang for eleven days, killing 103,000 bandits (including those killed by air strikes). As of 6:00 PM on the 20th, the Nianzhuang position was still held firmly by the Huang Corps.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Since dawn this morning, the Xuzhou outer base air force has used a large number of aircraft to cover the eastward-advancing corps, advancing toward Daxujia, Liulingjia, Pengjialou, and Sunzhuang. Nearly 30,000 bandits resisting on this line suffered heavy casualties from the air force's continuous bombing throughout the day, causing the entire line to waver. The eastward-advancing corps took advantage of the victory to enter Liulingjia, Sunzhuang, Daxujia, and other places, and are continuing to advance eastward. In addition, another powerful formation of the National Army's aircraft supported the troops defending Nianzhuang, carrying out fierce bombing around the village, with bombs falling like rain, killing countless bandits. (Another dispatch) The eastward-advancing corps in Xuzhou overcame all difficulties on the morning of the 20th, broke through the bandits' stubborn resistance, and continued to advance eastward beyond Daxujia. At the same time, the Huang Corps, which had been firmly defending Nianzhuang for eleven nights, continued to inflict heavy casualties on the stubbornly resisting bandits, achieving further amazing results.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The President recently sent a telegram of encouragement to the Sun Corps. The original telegram stated: "The Xuzhou campaign is crucial to the safety of the nation. For the past ten days, we have relied on the loyalty and courage of our officers and soldiers to repeatedly annihilate the invading bandits. I am deeply gratified. This corps has demonstrated the spirit of sacrifice in defending Xuzhou, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits. It is especially commendable. I hope all our officers and soldiers will adhere to the principles of mutual love, sincerity, and diligence, continue their efforts, and annihilate the enemy at the earliest opportunity to achieve complete victory."</p>

<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 19th] Amidst the great victory in the Xuzhou campaign, the reporter took a military vehicle to inspect the site of the fierce mountain warfare on the eastern front on the morning of the 17th. On the mountain peaks such as Jianshan, Mashan, and Black Mountain in the mountainous area south of Damiao and Daxujia, looking out from the heights, there was no sign of human habitation in the fields. Bandit corpses were scattered throughout the valleys, a ghastly sight to behold. According to documents picked up by the reporter from the bandit army's regimental headquarters addressed to its officers and soldiers, the strategy in this Huaihai campaign was to besiege the Huang Corps, block the Qiu Corps, and then cross the Yangtze River to attack Nanjing and Shanghai directly. However, this mission was extremely difficult. The reporter also picked up many "Merit Manuals" and cloth "Firepower Glory Certificates" used by the bandit army to boost morale. Furthermore, Army Commander Gao Jiren stated that the bandits ordered their troops to hold the mountainous areas of Mashan and Black Mountain for three days in order to besiege the Huang Corps. The Qiu Corps captured these several mountain peaks in just three hours, shattering the bandits' conspiracy. On the afternoon of the 18th, the reporter again traveled by car to the front line of the battlefield at Pantang and Jianglou, 26 li southeast of Xuzhou, where he met General Qiu Qingquan. General Qiu stated that on the night of the 18th, the bandits launched a fierce attack on six small villages with six columns. The fierce fighting lasted until the morning of the 18th, with the bandits suffering over 20,000 casualties. The remnant bandits had already fled toward Suqian and may detour through northern Jiangsu to retreat to southern Shandong. On the night of the 18th, the two sides fired over 12,000 shells, indicating the ferocity of the battle. The reporter returned to Xuzhou late at night.</p>
<h3 id="e6">On the Eve of the Decisive Battle in North China: Both Sides Actively Prepare and Engage in a Battle of Wits; The Bandits' Counterattack on Baoding Is Repulsed by the Defending Troops <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] A North China military observer stated: The military situation in North China is outwardly relaxed but inwardly tense, and is on the eve of a decisive battle. Both sides are actively preparing for the campaign. This battle will determine the fate of North China, so both sides are willing to exert all their strength. Neither side wants to exhaust their strength in scattered battles before the decisive battle. The National Army, in order to concentrate its forces, has painfully abandoned strongholds such as Baotou and Chengde and is allowing the bandit army to invade Suiyuan without dispersing its forces to provide western support. The bandit side is doing the same. For example, they have twice approached Guihua but hesitated. Recently, the Third and Fourth Columns just arrived around Baoding and quickly withdrew. All of this fully demonstrates how both sides are engaging in a battle of wits. The bandit army entering the pass from the Northeast is currently moving slowly southward from Pinggu. The identified units include four columns. The follow-up units and supplies are still en route. A part of their advance units have already reached Hexiwu (between Wuqing, Xianghe, and Tongxian). In the future, the area south of Zunhua, north of the Pingjin Road, and between Sanhe and Xianghe will be the battlefield for the main force's decisive battle. The 1st, 2nd, and 6th Columns of bandits attacking Suiyuan are too far from this main battlefield. They have also moved through Liangcheng and Fengzhen toward northern Shanxi and southern Chahar. There may be a fierce battle in the Nankou area of eastern PingSui. In the Suiyuan area, Baotou and Jining may be recovered soon. The observer stated that after the National Army concentrates its forces, it will be able to fight defensively, await opportunities, deploy flexibly, and have easy access to supplies, which is extremely advantageous for the National Army.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th] The National Army in Bingbian launched a proactive counterattack against the bandits in the suburbs. According to an announcement from the military, our powerful troops launched a fierce attack on over 1,000 bandits entrenched on the northwestern heights of Songzhuang east of the city at around 8:00 PM on the 19th.

After our infantry and artillery combined forces focused their firepower to bombard the enemy, and after two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were finally routed, and the heights were captured in one fell swoop. Before midnight, the bandits actually used poison gas shells to counterattack the National Army. Fortunately, the National Army had adequate protection, and the bandits' attempt to counterattack was foiled. The National Army in Xiaojiabao, Beiwucheng, Heituo, Zaoyuan, Qianjiafen, and near Shantou southeast of the city also launched mobile attacks against the bandits facing them, achieving considerable gains.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] The Thundering Electric aircraft of the Tonghai Brigade, in coordination with the Fortress aircraft formation of the Donghai Beida Brigade, continued to fly in batches from morning to dusk to attack the bandit army in the outer ring of Bingbian.

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 20th] Chairman Soong Tzu-wen recently received reporters and reported on his trip to Nanjing, saying: In addition to reporting for duty and attending the food conference, he also investigated the current overall military and economic trends. Regarding the food issue, the country has had a bumper harvest this year, and with the supply of U.S. aid rice and wheat flowing in, the current panic is entirely man-made. The problem has now been resolved through proper adjustment. As for the war situation, he himself has great confidence. The great victory in Xuzhou this time shows that the National Army has turned from defense to offense. Especially since the officers and soldiers of the Huang Baitao Corps are mostly from Guangdong, everyone in Guangdong feels honored that this great battle has turned from danger to safety. Since the military failure in the Northeast and the improper measures of August 19th, the communist bandits have had an opportunity to incite fear and panic. Therefore, he firmly prohibited anyone in Guangdong from creating a situation of terror. He was not understood by the general public at the time, but today they should understand the painstaking efforts he took in adopting past measures. The current government has a very effective plan for the economy to stabilize finance and prices, which will be announced and implemented soon. It will definitely promote import and export trade and provide effective outlets for the already paralyzed industry and commerce, increasing people's confidence in the currency system. In short, the military and economic situation has now taken a turn for the better. Although there are still many difficulties ahead, it will definitely be able to shatter the Third International's attempt to annex our country. Soong continued, saying: Guangdong province is guaranteed to have no shortage of rice and coal, and the supply of cotton yarn can also be obtained continuously. He concluded by saying: Guangdong province has an important position in the future. Under the leadership of the Central Government, it will thoroughly connect with the provinces in the rear and actively carry out construction in both military and economic aspects, which will surely enable it to surpass and advance. Soong finally answered reporters' questions: (1) There will be no relocation of the capital. (2) The authorities of the various provinces in South China are very harmonious, and there are no plans to establish a general organization to govern several provinces. (3) He did not participate in the last currency reform meeting. (4) He denied the rumors that he will preside over Taiwan or go to the United States.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Some official sources predict that President Truman may issue a statement after reviewing foreign policy with Secretary of State Marshall on the 22nd, reaffirming the ties between China and the United States and emphasizing the U.S. government's concern for the crisis in China. However, it is generally believed that the wording of this statement will be very cautious to avoid any suggestion of full support for President Chiang Kai-shek or any firm obligation on the part of the United States toward China. It is reported that President Chiang's letter to Truman requests: (1) that the United States declare its support for his war against the Communists; (2) that military aid be increased promptly; and (3) that it guarantee substantial aid will continue for several years. At the same time, it was announced in Paris that Marshall will return to Washington on the 21st to meet with Truman, who is returning from vacation in Key West.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 19th] Two leaders of the overseas Chinese community here, Zhou Jinzhao and Huang Renzhun, telegraphed President Truman, who is currently in Key West, Florida, asking him to provide more aid to the Chinese government fighting the Communists. Zhou and Huang both telegraphed President Truman in their capacity as U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee intends to propose in its report that the United States must provide full aid to China, otherwise it would be unnecessary. The report believes that the current piecemeal U.S. aid to China is of no help. In addition to advocating for immediate aid to China in the form of artillery and aircraft, the report also suggests providing economic aid to China to stabilize its currency.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Former U.S. Democratic Senator Clark, who went to China last month on the order of Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bridges to investigate, has returned home and presented a 6,000-word report to the committee on the 20th, advocating thorough aid to China. Clark's plan has five key points:</p>
<p>(1) Rapid and extensive direct military aid, such as the supply of firearms, aircraft, and ammunition.</p>
<p>(2) Expanding the scope of military advisors to strategic and tactical aspects.</p>
<p>(3) The amount of military aid to China should be large enough to reduce a significant portion of military expenditure in China's domestic budget.</p>
<p>(4) Financial aid to China to stabilize currency values.</p>
<p>(5) Strict supervision of the use of any loans to China.</p>
<p>Clark's plan did not mention funding, but he told reporters that it would require more than one billion dollars in the first year and six hundred million dollars each year thereafter until the CCP is defeated. Other daily economic aid and any long-term construction plans are not included. Clark said that he met with Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, who also hoped that the United States would immediately provide comprehensive assistance to save China from danger.</p>
<h3 id="e19">US Representative in China: Consistent Policy Toward China <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>US Embassy Spokesperson Tells Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 20th] A reliable source reported on the 20th that differences of opinion have arisen among the US representatives in China regarding the latest US policy toward China. The views of the naval and air force representatives are completely different from those of the State Department and army representatives. On the 20th, a US Embassy spokesperson told United Press International that the rumors of differences of opinion are untrue, and that the State Department and the three military branches stationed in China "have completely consistent opinions on the US policy toward China." However, the core of the so-called differences lies in whether it is still possible to provide timely and comprehensive assistance to China and save it from danger, and whether high-ranking officials in Washington should issue a policy statement indicating an attitude of "resolutely not standing idly by," or whether more aid would be of no avail. Well-informed sources said that judging from the remarks of Vice Admiral Badger, commander of the Western Pacific, the navy's view is consistent with the air force. Their view is also that of the group of US senators led by Zhou Yide, that China is closely related to anti-communist countries, and therefore China should be fully assisted to increase its strength. The basis of this theory is that President Chiang is the only powerful anti-communist core in China. If President Chiang steps down and a "coalition" government takes power, the Communist Party can dictate terms, and the United States' global anti-communist policy will suffer a major setback. On the other hand, the State Department and the army (represented by Major General Barr, head of the US advisory group), are said to support Secretary of State Marshall's policy, believing that China is beyond salvation and that the United States has no choice but to seek the next best thing. It is reported that local Economic Cooperation Administration officials also agree with this view, believing that even with more aid, the Chinese government will still collapse. Their view is that the United States should strive for a favorable position so that it can still influence the government in the future and support the participation of non-communist elements in the "coalition" cabinet.</p>

<h3 id="e22">On the Regulation of Import and Export Trade <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Chu</p>
<p>Reading the editorial "Developing Import and Export Trade" in this newspaper on November 16, I summarize its main points as follows: (1) The government should relax all loans to exporters and encourage exports; (2) The government does not need to regulate the foreign exchange required and obtained for imports and exports, and allows its unrestricted import; (3) The government only approves imported goods, and does not need to intervene in other matters. The above points all seem reasonable, but in reality, there are things that must be said, so please allow me to explain them as follows.</p>
<p>First, my country has always been an import-surplus country, especially after the victory and repatriation, the import-surplus situation has become increasingly serious; since it cannot live within its means, it cannot but have numerical restrictions on the import side. This kind of control is also found in post-war Britain, Canada, etc., and is not unique to my country. Since there are numerical restrictions on imports, and the supply cannot be maximized, the domestic need to maintain the existence of all industries and businesses must be balanced. It is necessary to prevent too much import of certain goods and too little import of certain goods, so that some industries and businesses receive generous supply while others suffer a major blow. Adjusting and correcting afterwards is already too late. This is the reason why there must be a classified import quota system after the import numerical restriction.</p>
<p>Second, since there is an import quota, the quota must be allocated. The import quota for each type of goods is estimated and determined by considering the needs of the whole country. If a fair and reasonable allocation is not made, then all regions and industries will get ahead, and those who come later will be left out. The former will have a surplus of raw materials, and the latter will have a shortage of materials and will have to stop work, creating a chaotic situation that cannot be remedied. The unfairness is more than this. This is the reason why there must be a quota allocation system after the import quota system.</p>
<p>Third, the original article also admits that the government must approve imported goods, but does not need to intervene in other matters. I do not know that since the import quota is indispensable, the government cannot just stipulate what can be imported and what cannot be imported. It must further allocate to prevent one party from receiving a generous supply and the other party from suffering a major blow, so that the abuse of cunning acquisition can be avoided; otherwise, the consequences will be disastrous.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects of quota allocation, there are even more things that people outside the industry cannot fully understand. I will select the main points and describe them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At present, the allocation of import quotas is entirely or largely targeted at factories and actual users. Among them, raw materials for vulcanization, raw rubber, jute, white paper, cigarette paper, wood pulp, tobacco leaves, tobacco stems, wool, yarn, etc. are all allocated to factory users. Oils, waxes, chemicals, metal products, hemp bags, tanning pastes, dyes, etc. are mostly allocated to factory users. For goods that cannot be directly allocated to factory users, in addition to various oils, which are allocated by the Gasoline and Diesel Oil Allocation Committee, the very few quotas obtained by other goods importers must also be sold to various users or wholesalers first, and a sales contract must be provided. After being certified by the buyer's association, they can apply for import. For example, in the case of white paper, since the implementation of control, each newspaper has directly obtained its due quota based on its user qualification. No user has "suffered endless exploitation," nor has it "given special classes of Chinese and foreign merchants the opportunity to make a fortune." This example applies to all industries, without further explanation.</p>
<p>(2) The allocation of the above-mentioned factory user quotas is all handled with the assistance of folk industrial and commercial organizations, and each allocated user signs and approves them before they are approved. In such a complicated environment, it is not easy to achieve ideal fairness. However, since its implementation, with the assistance of various industrial and commercial organizations and continuous improvements, there are few complaints. If it is said that special classes benefit from it and obtain undue quotas, then under the supervision of many parties, it is not possible in fact.</p>
<p>(3) Since the quota is allocated to factory users, there is one more point that is not well understood by the outside world, that is, in addition to obtaining a more reasonable and fair allocation in terms of numerical value, the quality and variety of each item can also be selected by the factory user. For example, if a factory is allocated a quota of US$3,000 for a certain metal product, the factory can determine what quality and size of metal material should be imported to meet actual needs. Therefore, in addition to "numerical control," the effect of "quality control" is also achieved. Without the aforementioned quota allocation system, anyone can freely import, and the imported goods always take personal interests as a prerequisite, not based on matching production needs. The abuses will first deplete foreign exchange, and then the supply will still be out of balance. If corrections are made only after difficulties occur, the losses to the government and the people will be incalculable.</p>
<p>The Import and Export Control Committee has been in charge of import and export trade management for the past two years, and has made its best efforts in quota allocation and trade management, and seems to have fulfilled its mission. However, whether the organization should be abolished is a matter of authority, not a matter of trade management. If trade still needs to be managed, then it can be done by the Import and Export Control Committee, or it can be done by other organizations, and neither can go beyond reality to achieve success. Therefore, I regard this issue of authority as insignificant and not the point of discussion in this article.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The first consolation group of the National Consolation Federation consoled the air force officers and soldiers who had contributed to the Xuzhou campaign at the Dajiaochang Airport at noon on the 20th.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] According to political circles here, former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes may resume his political career. Byrnes left the State Department in 1949 due to health reasons. Recently, several friends of Byrnes believe that Byrnes has now fully recovered. The first stage of Byrnes' return to the political world will probably be political activities within the Democratic Party, and he will make his native South Carolina support President Truman's policies. Furthermore, the state's Senate seat will expire in 1950, and many believe that Byrnes will be a candidate for this seat. If Byrnes is elected, the Democratic Party will gain an outstanding diplomatic expert in the Senate, just as the Republican Party has Vandenberg.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] Three thousand army and armored security forces marched to the port of Dunkirk on the 20th to suppress the striking dockworkers led by the Communist Party. In the past 72 hours, this historically famous port has become a dead port. Ships carrying US aid to France are unable to unload. In the first news from Dunkirk after the government used force, it was purchased that most of the 1,500 striking workers had sneaked through the obstacles such as wine barrels in the burning landscape. The striking workers concentrated inside the port gate, waiting for the outbreak of the national dockers' general strike launched by the Communist Party on the 22nd. Troops equipped with machine guns and armored vehicles in the rear advanced to Dunkirk on the 19th, and some strikers were busy setting up obstacles. The workers also carried wooden sticks, iron bars, stones and projectiles, but the troops did not encounter resistance when breaking through the first line of obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The UN General Assembly Passes the Belgian Disarmament Proposal; The Soviet Proposal is Vetoed; The Disarmament Issue Will Be Studied by the Armaments Committee <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 19th] The United Nations General Assembly tonight rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to disarm the five major powers by one-third and immediately ban atomic bombs by 39 votes to 6. Only the Soviet bloc voted in favor. The General Assembly then passed the Belgian proposal supported by the West by 43 votes to 6, with 1 abstention, stipulating that the Armaments Reduction Committee should continue to study disarmament steps.</p>
<p>Before the vote, U.S. Representative Dulles and Soviet Representative Vyshinsky engaged in a war of words. Dulles accused the Soviet proposal of being irresponsible and cruelly deceptive, while Vyshinsky accused the U.S. and Britain of engaging in a frenzied arms race against the Soviet Union, and said that "the chairman of the Western European Defense Committee, former British Chief of Staff Montgomery, has established a headquarters near Fontainebleau, Paris, to launch a new war against Eastern European countries." According to today's resolution by the UN General Assembly, the Armaments Reduction Committee will study next year how to organize international institutions to collect information from member states of the United Nations. The Soviet Union may not be interested in this kind of work.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The content of the Belgian proposal is to request the Security Council to have the current regular Armaments Committee study the current state of the standing armies of various countries and the disarmament plan, and said that the Security Council should obtain concrete results as soon as possible and submit a report to the next UN General Assembly. The proposal also pointed out that it is hoped that when the Armaments Committee begins its work, it should specify in detail the items that various countries should answer regarding the quantity and quality of armaments. The preamble to the Belgian proposal stated that "before various countries have accurate statistics on the quality and quantity of other countries' armaments and military strength, before an international convention on what kind of military strength and armaments should be restricted has been concluded, and before a control mechanism has been established, any disarmament proposal cannot be agreed upon. The work of disarmament can only be achieved in an atmosphere of improved international relations, and special attention must be paid to the early achievement of a compromise on the control of atomic weapons."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Admiral McGrigor, Commander of the British Home Fleet, told reporters today that the British Navy is being rebuilt and will be able to cope with any eventuality. The British flag is flying around the world again and exerting a stabilizing force. Asked if this stabilizing force could extend to China, McGrigor replied, "Of course, we also have a fleet stationed in China." McGrigor also responded to the effectiveness of the Soviet snorkel submarines, saying, "This is a major issue we are studying, but this is not a problem for the Soviet Union, but a normal development of war. There was a time when people said that battleships were outdated, but in World War II, especially in the Pacific War, we still made use of them. The theory of weaponry ebbs and flows, and soon the anti-submarine theorists will rise again."</p>

The weakening of China will inevitably be detrimental to the entire Asia. China and India have had many common ties for thousands of years, and there is even a sense of interdependence. I feel that the Soviet people expect peace no less than the people in any part of the world. When I was in the Soviet Union, I knew that its general people were undertaking post-war reconstruction work with great courage and excellent spirit.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 19th] Mrs. Pandit said that she had not been informed that she would be transferred to the post of ambassador to the United States. She plans to return to Moscow after the end of the UN General Assembly and continue to serve as ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Keenan, Chief Prosecutor of the Allied Far East International Military Tribunal, told United Press on the 20th that, for political reasons, the victorious nations had agreed to pardon Japanese Emperor Hirohito, so Hirohito would not be tried as a war criminal even if there was concrete evidence to indict the Japanese Emperor. He said that the decision to pardon the Japanese Emperor was a political decision of the Allied nations, and Soviet Premier Stalin also agreed. Keenan will return to Washington next week.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the Tokyo Military War Crimes Tribunal told reporters on the 19th: "If the Japanese Emperor personally attends the war crimes tribunal, it is expected that he will bear the responsibility for the war alone, which would violate the political stance of the United Nations. Therefore, since there are those who oppose the Japanese Emperor's attendance, the Japanese Emperor will not be summoned." Keenan will leave Japan for the United States on the 21st or 22nd because the war crimes tribunal has reached its final stage.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] A public gathering was held here today to demand that MacArthur reduce the sentences of the top Japanese war criminals by the Far East International Tribunal. A crippled man took the stage to speak out against the proposal, which almost caused the meeting to fail.

At that time, a ragged man limped forward, waving his crippled arm, and shouted in a rough, trembling voice: "These 25 people are responsible for the war that destroyed my family and cut off my livelihood." The host was extremely embarrassed and urged him to leave the meeting, and immediately declared that all Japanese people should bear the responsibility for the war, not just those 25 people. The gathering today was hosted by the "Greater Japan Youth Party." The term "Greater Japan" was often used by right-wing organizations in the past, but it is the first time in the past three years that it has been used as a name.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] During the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly's debate on the Palestine issue on the afternoon of the 20th, US representative Jessup will deliver an important speech explaining US policy. The US side stated that Jessup will urge the establishment of a UN mediation committee to guide the Arab and Israeli sides towards a permanent resolution of the Holy Land issue. Jessup's speech is based on President Truman's instructions and was initially intended only as a preliminary statement of US policy. However, due to the committee's postponement of the debate by one day, various factors were temporarily added, and his speech has become an actual statement of the US position. It is understood that the US favors hastily passing the Bernadotte Plan, a focal point of contention, as a guide for Arab-Israeli negotiations towards a permanent solution. However, it has been learned that the UK is likely to endorse the plan in its entirety this week, and Jessup is unlikely to take the same stance. The debate on the Holy Land issue has been turbulent and stalled for some time, and the US statement may break the deadlock.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] US representative Jessup stated in the Political Committee today that the Negev region of southern Palestine should not be taken from the Arabs without the full consent of the Israelis.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Labor-Management Disputes Still Numerous; Workers Dissatisfied with Low Index; Two Factories Willing to Suspend Operations Due to Unbearable Burden <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the resumption of the index-linked wage system, labor-management disputes have repeatedly arisen in various industries in the city. Everyone feels that the index of 8:1 is too low, and they are either requesting payment in kind or requesting salary advances. The Social Affairs Bureau is busy mediating. The more serious disputes are listed below: (1) Workers at the eight major flour mills, including Fufeng, Yutong, Jiancheng, and Fuxin, are unwilling to accept cash wages calculated at an 8:1 index because they feel the index is too low. They are requesting that these cash wages be used to purchase flour from the factories, with the flour price calculated according to the 819 price limit multiplied by the 8:1 index. At the same time, the issue of how to repay the two bags of flour borrowed before the index was announced has also become a source of dispute. The Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau is currently mediating. (2) Workers at the Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory previously borrowed two months' salary, and the management now plans to deduct it from this month's wages, causing a slowdown in work. (3) Workers at the Dacheng Iron Factory believe that the 8:1 index differs too greatly from the increase in commodity prices, and they are requesting a one-month salary advance in addition to their formal wages. The management stated that they cannot bear the burden and have submitted a request to close the factory. The Social Affairs Bureau has not approved it and plans to mediate again. (4) Workers at the Lihua Cigarette Factory are demanding salary advances, resulting in a strike. The management is willing to close the factory. (5) Employees of the Mianhua Thread Factory demanded that the factory issue two and a half zhang of cotton cloth produced by the factory to each person, and once went on strike. Work has resumed after mediation. (6) Workers in the electrical machinery group of the knitting industry are requesting rice subsidies, and labor and management are currently holding direct negotiations. (7) The management of small light bulb manufacturing companies, citing poor business conditions, is requesting that wages be calculated at 70% of the index and has proposed a suspension of work and pay. The labor side opposes this and has submitted a request for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The labor-management dispute in the movie theater industry has continued for three days, and negotiations between the two sides have been intermittent, with opinions consistently failing to converge. The Social Affairs Bureau has not yet formally intervened to mediate as of yesterday, and today is Sunday, so the opening of the stalemate may still be pending. According to the Movie Theater Industry Association, representing the management side, the demands raised by the employees this time are too extravagant, and the member movie theaters cannot bear the burden. They would rather remain closed for a long time than compromise. In response, the industry's labor union specially hosted reporters yesterday afternoon to refute the management's response. They believe that the five demands this time were delivered to the management as early as mid-July, asking the management to consider them for a longer period. The labor union's executive committee recently decided, in view of the soaring commodity prices and the fact that the living conditions of all employees have reached a desperate situation, to resubmit the aforementioned demands to the management. However, the management, citing poor business conditions, refused to negotiate and disregarded the living conditions of employees. All consequences and responsibilities arising from this should naturally be borne by the management side.</p>

<p>Labor and management in various industries continue to dispute over the index and improvements in benefits. Employees of Renji Hospital on Shandong Road also staged a protest yesterday morning over the issue of benefits. They registered patients as usual, but the outpatient department gave away needles and medicine for free. This was because the hospital's employees felt that the index for this period was too low and demanded that the hospital pay them at an 8:1 ratio of their base salary, plus an additional 50% allowance. After persuasion by the hospital, the employees expressed a willingness to compromise, but the terms of the two sides have not yet been finalized.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Merchants Request Relief; Executive Yuan Helpless <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to Liangxin News Agency, Shanghai rice merchants previously sold 265,700 shi of rice at the fixed price and sold it all. After the lifting of price controls, the price of rice soared, and the gold yuan coupons obtained by grain merchants from selling rice at the fixed price could not replenish 10% of the grain. Therefore, they submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for relief. It is understood that the Executive Yuan is quite sympathetic to the request of Shanghai rice merchants in principle, but during this period of suppression of the rebellion, everything should be based on military considerations. Therefore, there is a sense of helplessness. Judging from this, the Shanghai grain merchants' request for relief is impossible.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The flour transport to the north is still being handled by the Ministry of Food, which has entrusted the China Farmers' Bank to continue. The seventh batch of 370,000 bags of flour transported to the north was fully delivered last week, and the China Farmers' Bank is currently negotiating with seven major factories, including Fuxin and Fufeng, for the eighth batch of flour. It is rumored that the amount of flour purchased this time is 150,000 bags, which is less than the previous time. The purchase price is also being discussed. Because North China is in urgent need, the transport will be launched in the short term.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Today is Air Defense Day; Commemorative Meeting Held <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek Issues Special Instructions</p>
<p>Today is the 9th Air Defense Day. The air defense troops stationed in Shanghai, including the 4th Regiment of the Air Force Anti-Aircraft Artillery and the Surveying Battalion, held a commemorative meeting in Zhanghuabang. President Chiang Kai-shek issued the following instructions for Air Defense Day: "All comrades engaged in air defense work across the country: As the domestic campaign to suppress bandits enters its climax, and world peace has not yet been established, and human security is not yet guaranteed, we should have the following realizations as we hold this air defense commemoration: (1) Aviation weaponry is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and it has become an established conclusion that the air force will play a decisive role in future wars. How to establish an aerial defense line and realize a solid bulwark with air defense as the center of national defense is what all our air defense officers and soldiers should deeply recognize. (2) During the War of Resistance, all air defense measures seemed to focus only on land and some larger cities, but aerial attacks transcend the limitations of time and space. Future air defense construction must focus on ocean surveillance and areas with transportation, resources, and industry. The pursuit of air defense and protection must adapt to the times, seek novelty and preparedness, and must have comprehensive and permanent planning. This is expected of all levels of government agencies and every citizen to work together, each doing their best to cooperate. (3) The campaign to suppress bandits is related to the survival of the nation. All our air defense officers and soldiers, and every citizen, must raise their vigilance, clarify their thinking, distinguish right from wrong, and uphold the spirit of 'me or the bandits', thoroughly implement the established national policy of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, and pacify the bandit scourge. In particular, we should conduct a detailed review and timely planning on how our aviation and air defense operations can advance side by side, complement each other, and achieve coordinated results, so as to achieve perfection.

<h3 id="e84">Pigs Flood the Market; Merchants Request Three Points <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Hong Wenjiang, Chairman of the Shanghai Fresh Pig Business Association, visited Mayor Wu yesterday morning to report that pigs have recently flooded the market, with more than 10,000 arriving in the past two days. The wholesale price has fallen to around ten yuan. According to past sales, this city needs 2,500 fresh pigs daily, but now only more than 1,000 pigs are slaughtered daily, and retailers still have surpluses. Hong specially handed a petition to the mayor, requesting three points: (1) The slaughter tax has increased from one yuan and one dime per head to sixty-two yuan and nine dimes. The wholesale price is too low, and pig merchants cannot bear the losses. He requests that the tax collection be appropriately reduced. (2) Due to transportation obstacles, many pigs arriving in Shanghai are injured or dead. The price of dead pigs set by the Health Bureau is still one yuan and six dimes per head. It is estimated that the current value (including oil, skin, bones, etc.) is 300 yuan per head. If it is not adjusted immediately, merchants will lose their capital, which will inevitably affect the source of supply. (3) The suspension of fresh pig slaughter on Mondays was previously approved by the authorities, but in fact, fresh meat is still sold in the vegetable market on Tuesdays, creating opportunities for illegal retail meat stalls to obtain windfall profits. Legitimate pig merchants, on the other hand, suffer losses. He requests the restoration of pig slaughter on Mondays to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Mayor Wu responded to the points raised by the association separately: (1) Regarding the reduction of the slaughter tax, he instructed them to request it from the Finance Bureau. (2) Regarding the undervaluation of dead pigs, he agreed to instruct the relevant authorities to make reasonable adjustments. (3) Regarding the restoration of pig slaughter on Mondays, they can submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, which will submit it to the Thrift Movement Committee for discussion and decision.</p>

Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, more than 200 sailors from various ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai, including drivers, machinists, and wireless operators, gathered inside the company to petition General Manager Xu Xueyu. Wang Muzong, Manager of the Shipping Department, and Hu Shiyuan, Deputy General Manager, tried their best to persuade them. General Manager Xu Xueyu agreed to improve their treatment, increase their base salary, and also agreed to subsidize their salaries for October. The sailors then expressed their satisfaction and dispersed, and the import and export ships resumed normal service.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to meet the needs of the city, the Municipal Police Bureau has decided to implement a rural police system in the suburban branch bureaus. Currently, the Longhua and Xinxin Branch Bureaus have successfully experimented with it. This system was formulated by the newly appointed Administrative Director Sun Jialiang. Director Yu, in view of the good implementation of the above two branch bureaus, recently approved it and ordered the Yangxin, Sisheng, Gaoqiao, Xinshijie, Jiangwan, Dachang, and six other branch bureaus, as well as the Wusong and Zhenru police stations, to implement it in the same way from the first of next month. The content of the system is to integrate management, education, maintenance, and health. Police service districts are established within the jurisdiction of each branch bureau, with three Bao as one district, and seven to nine police service districts are combined into a joint service district, directly under the police station and the branch bureau. In addition to the necessary guard duties, the regular duty is stipulated to be mainly patrolling. Each policeman responsible for police service is selected from each district's normal school graduates of outstanding young people to fill the position after training, so that they can go deep into the countryside in the future and maintain regular direct contact with the villagers, so as to fully exert the functions of management, education, maintenance, and health.</p>

<p>The employees of the Jianghai Customs had previously gone on strike over demands to improve their treatment. At that time, the customs authorities agreed to wait for the handover between the old and new finance ministers before consulting with the ministry, and agreed to respond within three days.

The customs authorities stated that they could not accept the six demands raised by the employees, and only agreed to a one-month salary advance for each person. The employees stated that they could not accept this. Therefore, the personnel of the Statistics Section of the Tax Administration on Changde Road began a slowdown on the afternoon of that day. As of yesterday morning, all employees of the Jianghai Customs on the Bund and the Tax Administration on Changde Road had begun to stop working, causing all contacts to be suspended. Only a few senior officials were engaged in handling the closing of customs. According to what the reporter has learned: Because today is a weekly holiday, the customs authorities will order the responsible personnel to be dispatched from each department to try to negotiate tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Regarding the Increase of Fees for Private Primary and Secondary Schools; Director Li Issues a Statement; Discretionary Collection of Unspecified Amounts from Parents with Better Financial Conditions <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau issued the following written statement yesterday regarding the decision of private primary and secondary schools in this city to increase fees for students' parents due to skyrocketing prices and difficult living conditions for teachers: At this time of drastic price fluctuations, the Municipal Government and this Bureau deeply sympathize with the difficult lives of teachers in various private schools. At the same time, they are also very concerned about the difficult situation of the general student parents. In order to take both sides into consideration, I have always advocated that the improvement of teachers' living conditions can be achieved by each school collecting Teacher Respect Funds or Teacher Welfare Funds from students whose families have better financial conditions. The amount should not be rigidly stipulated, and the students' parents should also pay attention to their children's studies and sympathize with the difficult lives of the teachers, and take the initiative to help. All of the income from this Teacher Respect Fund or Teacher Welfare Fund should be distributed to the teachers in one lump sum, and the teachers themselves should organize a distribution committee to preside over it. Schools that collect Teacher Respect Funds or Teacher Welfare Funds should not discriminate against students who are poor and unable to pay.</p>
<p>Municipal Primary School Staff and Teachers; Host Reporters</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Primary School Staff and Teachers Association hosted reporters at the Second Central National School in the Fifth District yesterday, reporting that the entire reason for the general leave of absence was the problem of living conditions. Before the war, the salaries of municipal primary school staff and teachers could buy five to ten dan of rice, but the current average income is 140 to 150 yuan, which can only buy two or three dou of rice, plus three dou of rationed rice, totaling five or six dou. In addition, there are only two dan of briquettes. It is very difficult to maintain the family's life with this. In addition to demanding the same emergency relief as the municipal secondary school staff and teachers of one dan of rice, two bags of flour, and 500 gold yuan, they are also paying attention to fundamental solutions, demanding that the salaries of central civil servants and teachers should be calculated according to the cost of living index, and that the rationed rice should be restored to eight dou.</p>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Resuming Teaching; Awaiting Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Director Li of the Education Bureau summoned the principals of municipal primary schools and the directors and supervisors of the Municipal Primary School Staff and Teachers Association and representatives of various schools to talk at the First Central School in the Fifth District at 5:00 PM yesterday, advising the teachers to return to work on Monday. The Municipal Primary School Staff and Teachers Association has scheduled a general meeting of all representatives at the First Central School in the Fifth District at 2:00 PM on Monday to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A portion of the private primary school teachers in this city submitted separate petitions to the Municipal Council, the Municipal Government, and the Education Bureau yesterday, stating that their treatment was meager and they were unable to maintain their livelihoods. And the matter of increasing the second tuition fee has caused the parents to feel overwhelmed and they are strenuously opposing it, so they are requesting government relief: (1) Distribute emergency relief of 500 gold yuan, one shi of white rice, and two bags of flour to each person. (2) Regardless of whether the school is public or private, each person should enjoy in-kind rations on a monthly basis, and they also requested the rationing of one pound of yarn recently. (3) Regardless of whether the school is registered or not, the monthly rationing of rice should still be supplied as usual.</p>

<p>Comfort Mission to Fly to Xuzhou Tomorrow, Reporters to Depart Together</p>
<p>Large Quantity of Comfort Goods to Be Transported by Land and Air</p>
<p>The delegation representing all sectors of the city to comfort the soldiers fighting against the communists will assemble at the Friends of the Military Association tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. Led by the head of the delegation, Fang Zhi, a group of more than ten people will fly to Xuzhou to comfort the troops. The first batch of comfort goods, generously sponsored and donated by various parties, has already raised 40,000 dozens of towels, 20,000 dozens of gloves, 20,000 dozens of socks, 62,500 catties of candy, 3,000 dozens of sanitary shirts, and 500 large cases of cigarettes in two days. In addition to a portion of the comfort goods being transported by plane with the delegation, the majority will be transported by land. At the same time, active and extensive fundraising efforts are still underway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the launch of the "Million Letters to Comfort the Troops" campaign, many people from all walks of life have been sending comfort letters to the Friends of the Military Association, entrusting the comfort mission to take them to the front lines. Today is the last day for the comfort mission to collect letters. If there are any more comfort letters, they can be directly delivered to the Comfort Mission at the Friends of the Military Association on Zhabu Road for forwarding. In addition, in order to cover the real situation on the battlefield, the local press has organized a reporter visiting group to depart with the comfort mission and fly to Xuzhou for interviews. The comfort mission will also bring a large number of comic books, slogans, and leaflets when they depart for the front lines to comfort the troops. The Central Film Studio has also sent personnel to accompany them to produce films. In order to standardize the numbering of comfort missions and ensure uniform steps, the National Comfort Association has designated the Shanghai All-Circles Comfort Delegation to the Soldiers Fighting Against Communism as the Second Comfort Delegation of the National Comfort Association.</p>
<p>The Campaign Against Rebellion Propaganda Team</p>
<p>Working Very Intensely</p>

Their work is very intense.</p>
<p>Hu Jiongxin Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss the Stability of Xuzhou City</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hu Jiongxin, a commissioner of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters who recently arrived in Shanghai from Xuzhou on official business, Shanghai people's consistent concern about the situation in Xuzhou is unexpected. The views of some Shanghai people on the approach of the communist forces to Xuzhou are in direct contrast to those of the military and civilians in Xuzhou. The former fear the danger of the communist forces approaching Xuzhou, while the latter fear that they will not approach and lose the opportunity to lure and annihilate them. While a small number of people in Shanghai are disturbed by the rumors and are nervous that Xuzhou is in chaos or has even fallen, General Commander Liu Jingfu, who is stationed in Xuzhou, is still commanding calmly. The stability of the city makes it hard to believe that it is in a state of war, and the morale of the front lines is even higher than in any previous battle.</p>

<p>Discuss Valuation of Transportation Company Equipment</p>
<p>The Municipal Council will hold a symposium of all council members in the council meeting room at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The main topic of discussion will be the review of the valuation method for the existing equipment of the Municipal Public Transportation Company, which is scheduled to be established in the middle of next month. The valuation list was previously carefully reviewed and finalized by the Public Utilities Bureau in conjunction with representatives from other relevant agencies, and was approved by the Public Utilities and Regulations Subcommittees of the council, with a total amount of over 9,537,000 gold yuan. However, how to appreciate the value after the central government revised the issuance method of the gold yuan notes is still subject to final decision at tomorrow's symposium. According to reports, the symposium will discuss the issue of further price adjustments for public utilities this month. According to a council spokesperson, in addition to the valuation of the public transportation company, no agenda has been pre-arranged for the symposium, but in this unstable environment, current general phenomena may trigger a wide range of discussions to seek solutions.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Unified Tax Adjusted Yesterday</p>
<p>Increased About 250% Compared to Before</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The cotton yarn unified tax was adjusted again starting yesterday, with an increase of about 250%. The adjusted tax rates for each yarn count are as follows: 10 count, 275 yuan; 16 count, 20 count, 520.83 yuan; 21 count, 520.85 yuan; 32 count, 657.87 yuan; 32 count double-ply, 694.40 yuan; 40 count, 702.08 yuan; 42 count double-ply, 875 yuan; 60 count, 1,051.30 yuan; 60 count double-ply, 1,287.11 yuan; 80 count double-ply, 2,094.72 yuan; 100 count double-ply, 3,230.24 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Slightly Rebound, Cloth Market Remains Flat</p>
<p>Due to the increase in the unified tax on yarn, asking prices once rose. The initial asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was 10,500 yuan. On Monday, it was sold for 800 yuan, and it returned to its original price after the high point. It was also once in high demand. Later, due to more sales, near-term accounts made up for losses, and it closed at 10,100 yuan. This was still a rebound of 500 yuan compared to the previous day. Jincheng was 9,800 yuan, 32-count Silver Moon was 8,300 yuan, and 21-count Double Horse yarn once saw a high of 8,000 yuan midway. After the high point, there was a lot of supply and sales were scarce. It recently recovered to 7,500 yuan, and spot goods closed at 7,200 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also recovered by 200-300 yuan to 600-700 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market remained flat, and sales in the local and external markets remained sluggish. Merchants exchanged cloth for rice, with each bolt of Longtou fine cloth exchanging for about seven or eight dou of rice. Recently, due to the decline in rice prices, farmers' demand also became stagnant. When the 12-pound Longtou fine cloth first opened, it was absorbed by the Nanjing gang, and the asking price rose to 345 yuan. It then fell back to 330 yuan due to sales by large households in the northern gang. The closing price fell by another 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The 4-Gentlemen Yuan twill also once saw an asking price of 343 yuan with some transactions. Later, due to the increased allocation by the Textile Construction Company, the closing price fell slightly to 330 yuan, also down 10 yuan. The 190 high-end Shilin cloth was still asking for 650 yuan for a transaction. There was very little activity in other colored cloth, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse cloth, and asking prices also changed little.</p>
<p>Third Board of Directors Meeting of the Textile Construction Company</p>
<p>Resolved Five Important Cases</p>
<p>The General Manager's Resignation is Still Being Retained</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Company held its third board of directors meeting yesterday morning, starting at 10:00 AM. Chairman Chen Qitian extended the meeting until about 3:00 PM before it adjourned. There were five important motions: (1) The local governments of the Tianjin and Qingdao branches of the Textile Construction Company have restricted the transportation of finished yarn and cloth products to Shanghai due to the implementation of total war. As a result, the cotton from the Shanghai headquarters will also be unable to be transported there. It was resolved to petition the authorities to allow the company to coordinate and adjust supplies within the scope of the company's business. (2) The governments of Taiwan and Guangdong provinces requested that the Textile Construction Company move a portion of the spindles (spindles that were originally shut down and have now been refurbished) to the two provinces to start production. It was resolved to consider this and send Wu Weijing and Ouyang Lun to conduct investigations and designs. (3) The Textile Construction Company's maximum cotton inventory once reached more than 1.1 million dan, but now it only has more than 200,000 dan. In terms of business, the company's working capital is extremely difficult due to the losses from price-limited allocation and sales. It was resolved that the company's business will be handled according to ordinary business practices in the future in order to maintain operations. (4) Regarding the company's auditing matters, it was resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will consult with the Ministry of Audit to resolve the matter. (5) General Manager Shu Yuzhang had previously been retained by the board of directors to continue in his position for two months, which will expire at the end of this month. He has firmly requested to resign after the expiration of his term, and Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing has also expressed the same intention. It was resolved to unanimously and firmly retain them until a successor is determined.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Continues to Soften</p>
<p>The spot cotton market also softened yesterday. Factories had no intention of absorbing it, and holders were unable to raise prices. Only 60 bales were traded throughout the day. Shashi 13/5 delivered to the factory was 1,500 yuan, with 50 yuan traded. Hankou fine velvet 13/5 was 1,280 yuan delivered at the warehouse, with 10 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was asking 290 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Market Continues to Consolidate</p>
<p>The artificial silk market has been too weak in recent days, and sentiment cannot get any lower. Holders are holding on and not selling, and demand in the Tai Street area is still weak. Both buyers and sellers are taking a wait-and-see approach, and trading on the market is thin, with mediocre market conditions. The spot price of 120 count Tianqiao opened at 9,000 yuan in the morning. It rose by 500 yuan after opening, and then fluctuated around that level. Transactions stalled, and it closed back at the original level. Dongyang initially traded at 9,300 yuan. After opening, sentiment was still stable, and holders were not determined to sell. Later, due to sluggish sales, the market atmosphere was flat.</p>
<p>Transactions in the raw silk market were thin yesterday, and the market was slightly soft in the middle. Industry sentiment was scattered, and sales were sluggish. There was little movement in the prices of various grades. Grade D 7-8 evenness was initially asking 10,000 yuan for spot goods. After opening, there were slight transactions among colleagues. Later, when it was heard that yarn and cloth prices were rising, sentiment became very firm, and the asking price rose slightly, fluctuating around 9,500 yuan. There was little trading at the close, and prices trended flat.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market continued to be weak. Industry participants were adjusting positions and some were urgently seeking cash. Market prices were soft after opening, and there was no improvement at the close. Huaqiang crepe opened at 6,500 yuan for spot goods in the morning. Holders did not sell during the middle of the day, and then prices fell by 300 yuan. Even after the decline, demand from customers was still weak, and the closing price fell by another 200 yuan. Various goods such as Dawei woolen fabrics and crepes all declined in unison. Transactions were weak.</p>
<p>Supply Abundant, Rice Market Continued to Fall Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of rice in the north and south markets was abundant, totaling 6,005 shi and two dou. Supply was plentiful, but demand in the local market was stagnant, with few buyers and extremely sluggish transactions. Furthermore, because transactions required same-day checks, traders were unable to buy due to tight credit. Holders could not bear the high interest rates and painfully sold off their holdings, flooding the market and causing prices to decline. When the southern market opened in the morning, prices were already hovering on a downward path. The asking prices fell even lower towards the close, and there were even few inquiries. If buying with cash, high-quality white japonica rice could be traded for 480-500 yuan, so the trend was extremely sluggish. The prospects for rice may continue to decline. Market quotes were white japonica and thin japonica at 530 yuan each, early rice at 480 yuan, indica at 500 yuan, and white yuan at 530 yuan. Average japonica rice prices fell by 40-50 yuan, and indica rice prices fell by 30-40 yuan. The trend in the northern market was also lackluster, with all goods declining by 40-50 yuan.</p>
<p>The trend in the flour market recovered and became firm because the China Trust Bureau negotiated with six major flour mills, including Fufeng and Fuxin, to purchase 150,000 bags of grade 2 flour. Therefore, the mills lacked goods to sell on the market yesterday. The process went from firm to weakening, but ultimately closed 20-30 yuan higher than the previous day. Guangye flour opened strongly and closed at a high price of 165 yuan. Because of tight credit conditions, many traders took advantage of the low prices to replenish their stocks of miscellaneous grains, so the trend was slightly firm. Edible oil mills and retail investors both sold off their holdings, and prices were flat. Crude oil remained at its original level, and rapeseed oil fell by about 20 yuan. Soybean cake transactions were sluggish, and the trend was also weak.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Orders Change in the Amount of Fines for Money Shops</p>
<p>Depositors Limited to Using Their Real Names</p>
<p>The National Treasury Inspection Office recently sent a circular to all branches, stating that it had approved a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, which stated: "After reviewing the current situation following the currency reform, it is determined that the provision in Article 5 of the 'Ministry of Finance's Supervisory Measures for Money Shops Requiring Depositors to Use Their Real Names', which was promulgated and implemented on May 12, 1947, stipulating that a fine of 20,000 to 200,000 yuan should be imposed on each depositor, should be changed to a fine of 10 to 30 gold yuan for each depositor. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan for record and distribution, it is hereby requested to check and instruct the inspection offices in each district to pay attention to whether the depositors in the money shops are using their real names during inspections and to report them to the headquarters at any time."</p>
<p>Money Shops to Adjust Interest Rates Again Starting Monday</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Money shops will adjust interest rates again starting next Monday (the 22nd). Interbank overdue interest rates will be raised to 15 yuan per thousand yuan for daily borrowing, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 4.5 fen; interbank lending rates will be 12 yuan per thousand yuan for daily lending, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 3.6 fen; interbank deposit interest rates will be 5 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 1.5 fen. The average increase is about 15%, which is close to the market's informal interest rates. Since the lifting of price controls, this is the second adjustment of interest rates by money shops.</p>
<p>Import Management Committee Discusses Import Quantities of Raw Materials</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Import Management Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of future import quantities of industrial raw materials. It is understood that the committee will import goods according to the actual monthly needs of various industries in a planned manner. To set quotas, it will first consult with the industrial sector. It is now known that the needs for artificial silk and wool, including the Shanghai area and other parts of the country, have been initially tallied.</p>
<p>Import Management Committee Raises Export Price Limit for Tung Oil</p>
<p>Since the Import Management Committee implemented the export price limit measures, it has been quite effective in stabilizing the foreign market prices of our export goods. The price limits for foreign export materials have also been repeatedly raised separately. Recently, the price of tung oil in the United States has risen again. In order to adapt to the overseas market situation, the committee has decided to appropriately raise the minimum price of tung oil for the next week (November 22-27). The price for standard quality tung oil in bulk is 20 cents per pound, and in barrels is 21 cents per pound. The price limits for the remaining goods will remain unchanged for the time being.</p>
<p>Resumption of Purchasing Ice Eggs for Export to the UK</p>
<p>The Principle Has Been Approved by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The purchase of ice eggs for export to the UK will be resumed. This principle has been approved by the Executive Yuan and will still be handled by the China Trust Bureau. The China Trust Bureau is actively preparing. It is understood that the contract with the UK Ministry of Food for ice eggs this year is for a total of 17,000 tons, and the China Trust Bureau has purchased more than 12,000 tons. Since the issuance of the gold yuan, ice egg merchants have also exported more than 1,000 tons on their own. Only 3,500 tons have not been exported this year. Recently, prices have continued to rise, making exports extremely difficult. The government has resumed purchases, but at the current market price of 20,000-25,000 gold yuan per ton, and with the UK price calculated at 210 pounds per ton, which is only equivalent to 12,000 gold yuan, the cost difference is about double, making it impossible for ice egg merchants to export on their own. After the government resumes purchases this time, the profits and losses will still be borne by the national treasury.</p>
<p>Foreign Tea Quiet</p>
<p>The foreign tea market continued to be calm yesterday. The asking prices between exporters and sellers of tea in chests for export remained firm, and transactions have not yet recovered. As for tea for domestic sale, there is still demand in the local market and the Suzhou-Changzhou area, especially for low-end coarse tea. Unfortunately, inventories in the market are insufficient to meet demand. Although the small amount of inventory remaining in the production areas is said to be in transit, it is a drop in the bucket. Prices have repeatedly shown positive signs.</p>
<p>Sugar Slightly Up</p>
<p>The sugar market yesterday saw mixed ups and downs, with prices fluctuating. When the market opened, local demand was smooth, and sentiment was firm. There was not much supply on the market, and asking prices rose directly. Later, due to profit-taking by customers, retail sales were unable to make up for the losses, and market conditions flattened after the high point. No. 4 and 5 white granulated sugar initially asked for 400 yuan and had some sales. It then rose by 20 yuan. Finally, there were more sales than purchases in the market, and it closed at a low of 380 yuan. The supply of coarse sand was still strong, but local demand was sluggish, and it also saw a decline. The remaining goods all saw price increases.</p>
<p>Lumber Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>The lumber market has been sluggish recently due to a lack of construction activity. Previously, there was absorption by various parties when the financial situation changed, but recently there have been sales for days, resulting in inconsistent market prices. Western pine is around 4 yuan, and fir is 1.3 yuan.</p>

<p>Strengthening Pacification Efforts in South China</p>
<p>Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liang Feng</p>
<p>[Reported by Airmail from Guangzhou on the 15th of This Month] In order to consolidate South China and cooperate with the overall cause of suppressing rebellion and construction, Song Ziwen, Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Guangzhou, is currently striving to strengthen the military strength of South China. According to related sources, Song carried a plan for joint defense and suppression of communist bandits by various provinces in South China when he went to Nanjing to consult with the central government. If approved, the Guangdong-Hunan and Guangdong-Guangxi joint bandit suppression organizations may be established first to ensure that the local pacification forces of Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces are effectively strengthened.</p>
<p>Active measures are currently being taken to strengthen the military forces within Guangdong Province. In addition to ordering local self-defense forces to ensure soundness, the Guangdong Security Command has been approved to expand three security regiments, which have been expanded and assigned to the second, third, and tenth bandit suppression areas to strengthen bandit suppression work. It is found that there were originally ten security regiments in Guangdong Province. After Chairman Song took office, he increased the number by five regiments, and another regiment was added this summer, making a total of sixteen regiments. Now, with the addition of three more regiments, there will be a total of nineteen security regiments including the previous ones, which can be said to have reached the most complete state in terms of local military strength.</p>
<p>Increasing the Army</p>
<p>Recently, in order to strengthen the pacification forces in South China, the central government specially approved the addition of the 109th Army in Guangdong, with Zhong Bin, Director of the Ninth Training Department, concurrently serving as the army commander (formerly the commander of the Youth Army Division). The army headquarters was established somewhere on November 15th. It is heard that the army is under the command of three newly equipped divisions. All officers and soldiers have received new and rigorous training at a certain army training base of the Ministry of National Defense and will have sufficient supplies and excellent equipment, and their combat effectiveness will be very strong.</p>
<p>Naval Patrols</p>
<p>As for the navy, all gunboats and gunboats under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Naval District are currently stepping up patrols in sections to assist in the pacification of various rivers and anti-smuggling work. According to Yang Yuanzhong, Commander of the Naval District, the most rampant banditry in Guangdong Province is currently on the rivers in the Huizhou area of ​​Dongjiang. However, the fundamental method of suppressing bandits requires the ground forces to be deployed closely, hold the high ground, and cooperate with the water police to encircle and annihilate them in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Smugglers Retreat</p>
<p>Regarding anti-smuggling: After the implementation of the anti-smuggling agreement between China and Hong Kong, the navy can enter Dapeng Bay and Dasha Bay on the west side of the Leizhou Peninsula. The customs gunboats are responsible for pursuing smugglers in Vietnamese territorial waters. However, recent smuggler activity has mostly switched to land routes, and tax-evading smugglers on the sea have almost completely disappeared. Yang also said that he will recently cruise the Dongsha, Xisha, Nansha, and other islands to inspect the garrison situation.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from here: The Air Force First Military Region Command, originally stationed in Hengyang, has recently decided to move to Guangzhou. Its advance team has already arrived in Guangzhou. It has been found that the area has a total of seven offices and twenty-two sections, with more than 300 officers and a fleet of more than 200 aircraft, making it a very large organization. The staff of the area is also contacting the Pacification Headquarters in Guangzhou to find a suitable location.</p>

Isn't it for the safety and happiness of our people!" The words were sincere and appropriate, giving the soldiers great comfort and arousing the impulse of the people of Changzhou.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper Suzhou on the 20th] The county government has launched a campaign to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers in Xuzhou, and has joined relevant agencies such as the County Council to solicit comfort funds separately, which will be remitted to the province for overall management within days.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Most parents oppose the collection of second-term tuition and miscellaneous fees by private primary and secondary schools, but most schools have already set figures and notified students to pay.
