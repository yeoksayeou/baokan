<p>〔中央社歸綏一日電〕沿平綏西段向包頭挺進之國軍廿七日越過薩縣，繼續向西疾進，西路寗夏步騎勁旅以雷霆之勢直趨包頭，廿九日下午四時國軍抵達包頭城郊，卽開始攻擊，城內殘匪倉惶夜戰，經國軍猛烈攻擊，卒進入城內，殘匪狼狽沿黃河南竄。包市於十月廿三日陷匪，至比始東見天日。又歸綏一日電，我向綏南掃蕩部隊，卅日晚收復托縣縣城殲匪向南潰退。</p>
<p>〔中央社張家口一日電〕張垣外圍攻防戰，由於國軍在孔家莊（張垣西卅華里）與萬全兩主力戰之美滿成功，一日下午三時許，已獲全勝，敗匪正分一股向老北合口（萬全北）黃家堡（萬全西）及黃家堡以西山岳地帶潰逃，刻戰事已進入逍剿階段。此次共匪竭其竄犯綏境負創之殘部，號稱第一·二·六·三個縱隊之主力，妄想竄犯張垣，孤立平津，今遭此慘敗，其狂妄之陰謀已粉碎無遺。據初步統計，斯役斃僞匪旅長以下約五千餘人，戰利品正統計中。</p>
<p>〔又電〕張家口一日電，張垣市郊痛殲犯匪，卅晚一時許，竄擾萬全縣境匪一股偷襲張垣市平門外西北五華里處之國軍陣地，繳烈戰鬥約二小時許，犯匪除就殲者外，殘部均逸去。</p>
<p>〔又電〕張垣外圍出繫國軍於一日下午收復郭磊莊（張垣西六十華里）。又，平張鐵路卅日已暢通無阻，一日由平開出之客貨車東下，六時可抵達此間。</p>
<h3 id="c2">冀北匪犯密雲被擊退　古北口國軍轉移至有利防地 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報通縣一日電〕軍息：卅日林匪十一縱隊千餘，附砲數門，進犯密雲外圍，與守軍激戰竟夜，今拂曉被國軍擊退，殘匪竄向東北方向，國軍正追擊中。古北口自掩護承德主動撤退後，其軍事價値已成過去，該地國軍業於廿九日安全轉向有利防地。</p>
<p>〔本報通縣卅日電〕冀東大戰迄仍密雲不雨，匪軍動態仍在凖備階段：（一）三河·玉田·豐潤·盧龍·遷安等平原匪正利用交通溝，加緊展修，企岡遮避行動。（二）隆馬闌峪，遵化盤山，薊縣燕山及平谷一帶山嶽，正趕掘防空陣地，作持久據點。（三）匪爲煊染兵力，其番號多擴大，如縣支隊改稱游撃大隊，警備團改警備旅。據某觀察家談：冀東匪軍目前香號爲八個縱隊，兵數約十萬餘人，較國軍實力相差尙遠，且屢被國軍陸空炸剿，行動頻感咸脅，故大戰在短期內猶無爆發跡象。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓一日廣播：蔣夫人於一日上午十時自舊金山搭杜魯門總統專機「聖牛號」飛抵此間，馬歇爾夫人，顧維鈞大使及其他大使館人員均在機塲迎接。蔣夫人與馬夫人步行至汽車時，馬夫人詢以「要否發表談話」？蔣夫人答稱「否」。蔣夫人在機塲僅逗留片刻，等待新聞記者攝影，事畢，卽偕馬夫人驅車前往浮吉尼距馬歇爾之私邸。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕蔣夫人預定在美勾留兩星期，日程未排定，僅被邀於最初數日下榻浮吉尼亞州里斯堡國務卿馬歇爾夫婦故宅（建築於十八世紀）。馬歇爾本人則已入華爾德禮特醫院檢查身體，住院至少數日，截至現在爲止，蔣夫人尙未約定日期會見馬歇爾或杜魯門總統，美國官方自當以禮遇一國元首之夫人。美國官員以爲蔣夫人此行匪特欲籲請美政府援助，且將鼓動美國人民更加注意中國地位，此時杜魯門·馬歇爾兩氏則顯已商定未便使美國深深捲入中國內戰漩渦。審愼有限制的援助新計劃，似仍有可能，惟此計劃是否擬强力援助中國政府則仍未定。美國當局認爲不問蔣氏獲得何種援助，能否恢復勢力，殊無多大信念。中國大使館方面對於蔣夫人此行日程，亦未能提供多大消息，可能舉行記者招待會一次，但亦尙待其最後決定。蔣夫人在此大部份時間當以粵省政府主席子文之華盛頓公館爲其辦事處。</p>
<p>〔中央社舊金山卅日合衆電〕蔣總統夫人乘美海軍機，經八千英里之飛行後，於卅日上午十一時十六分在舊金山南約卅英里處之海軍航空基地着陸。軍方代表，國務院禮賓司帮辦繆爾夫人，中國駐舊金山總領事張索常及前西太平洋美海軍司令柯克上將等均到塲迎候。夫人下機後，對新聞記者抱緘默之態度，拒不討論其呼籲美國全面援助中國政府事。中國人士稱：夫人相信，伊之意見最好逕向華府表示。夫人旋應邀至機塲高級軍官營房午餐後，卽乘汽車進城。往晤其姊孔祥熙夫人宋靄齡女士。當晚八時換乘杜魯門總統以前專機「聖牛」號續飛華府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕蔣夫人抵美時，適上海傳來消息稱：夫人目的之一，在勸說馬仍爾任令高級美將領一人自動卦華，指揮剿共戰事。消息稱，蔣總統特別希望麥克阿瑟元帥，克拉克將軍或魏德邁將軍將赴華，又傳國防部長福萊斯德曾請杜魯門允蔣總統之要求，然馬歇爾不表贊同</p>
<p>〔本報華盛頓卅日電〕孔祥熙博士卅日下午三時赴白宮訪謁杜魯門總統，晤談約半小時，辭出統府後，接見白宮新聞記者，謂渠此次謁晤美總統，係普通拜會性質。詢以渠曾否提及立卽援華問題時，孔氏答稱：渠除向總統致意外，會與總統討論世界問題。新聞界人士由孔氏與杜魯門會晤時間推測，咸覺兩人間必有極重要之商談，但孔氏始終保持緘默。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅日電〕霍夫曼中國之行，殆爲擴大援華計劃之前奏，國會監督援華計劃委員會調査員査埃與賴基甫自中國返此，霍夫曼卽繼之成行，殆有連帶關係。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕霍夫曼宣布赴遠東，乃發生於蔣夫人來美呼籲以更多援助予華之前夕，霍夫曼將於十二月廿日返美，霍氏之報吿，將爲指導美行政當局之對蔣夫人答覆。霍夫曼之總部稱：霍夫曼將取道英國赴遠東，渠在英倫將與歐洲復興計劃官員作簡短之會議。霍氏定十二月四日乘泛美公司飛機赴英，在英倫勾留四天，至八日來上海定十一日可抵達，此後將與經合署中國分署署長賴樸翰作一連串會議。霍氏將與其特別帮辦李却斯同行，並將赴朝鮮一行，然後取道東京，於十八日返舊金山。</p>

<h3 id="c7">圍城徐州明暗兩面 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　丁維棟</p>
<p>徐東的大會戰，到上月廿五日。事實上已吿結束，苦守碾莊的黃兵團突圍與邱兵團會師，陳毅部主力於受創之餘，開始作戰略上的撤退。這裏可以看出，今日國軍所要應付的大敵，眞是一個可怕的對手；就在國防部宣告大捷聲中，陳毅的主力迅速南移，配合盤踞宿縣的劉伯承部，。威脅首都的大門—蚌埠。徐州剿總爲應付這個新的態勢，亦作了一個重大的決定，把國軍主力和剿總全部移至蚌埠，由劉總司令坐鎭指揮，徐州改設指揮所，由杜津明將軍主持。就軍情而言，這是一個很勇敢而合時的行動。因爲當東綫激戰時，劉伯承乘虛而下宿縣，徐州在事實上成了圍城，卽使在東綫勝利後，週圍數十里外仍是匪軍部隊，一切全賴空運支持。根據長春的經騐，可知空運是件極花錢的玩意，國家今日的財力不堪長期負擔，徐州的前途和安全，全賴津浦路南段是否能打通以爲斷。另外一個考慮，是國軍在兵力上居於劣勢，所賴以制勝的，是旺盛的火力和良好的訓練；在蚌宿決戰中，亦需要集中兵力。於是，劉峙將軍於某日午夜二時半，接獲南京的電召，由當局面授機宜。由上月廿六日起，徐州的兵員和這火，源源不絕的南遝蚌埠，整個的局勢起了變化，徐州在戰略上暫時失去了重要性。記者於上月廿五日抵徐，廿九日深夜離徐返京，在此短促的數日內，目擊種種演變，深感戰爭命運之無常，和一般人民應付危局的鎭定。</p>

<p>在暴風雨來襲之前，徐市確一度陷於慌亂，津浦路南下的客車，其擁擠程度遠過於限價末期的京滬路。人類原有求生的本能，有身家的人尤其珍惜生命，在這批難民之中，大多是富商大賈和力能遷移者，爲數約佔市民全數七份之一。留下的約有二十萬人，抱着聽天由命的態度，坐守危城。事實上，在三年的戡亂軍事中，戰火燒近徐州已不止一次，危難時鎭定的態度，一半是中國老百姓的氣質使然，一半是經騐鍛鍊了他們。</p>
<p>當戰爭的潮浪全力襲擊徐州的時候，情景是很可怕。賈汪棄守後，徐市的電源斷絕，全城一片漆黑。戰事的最高潮是在上月十·十一兩天，陳毅的兵力自北西南三方面逼近徐州。東南二十里的空軍基地，亦受到砲擊。機槍聲澈夜可聞，密如驟雨，砲繫震動的猛烈，民間的玻璃窗爲之破碎。這是徐州防衛戰中最緊張的一幕，起因是一部份軍隊的異動，使匪軍得以逼近徐市。以後國軍主力兵團東進，戰事逐漸向外圍擴展，這座華東名城，居然倖免了砲火的洗禮。事後檢討，徐州之能逃過這次難關，固然是將士用命，但內部之安寗，人民之鎭定，亦是重要的原因。據徐州警備司令譚輔烈將軍談：在每次大會戰中，最怕兩件事情發生，一是軍隊叛變，二是後方先亂，例如深夜打槍縱火之類。像兗州濟南之失，除外在原因之外，往往在緊急關頭，先發生內部的擾亂，結果是一夫夜呼，亂者相從，前方軍心一慌，防綫不攻而自下了。徐州在這次決戰中，可戰之兵全部調至外圍，內部異常空虛，但是在整個作戰過程中，市區內從未發現夜間開槍搗亂的事件。推源其故，全由於平日戶口和保甲組織嚴密所致。徐州每一家人家，都有全家照相存在警備部。警察局，和保甲長方面，隨時核對，使奸宄無法混跡。因爲有這點組織的基礎、所以能在危難時安定了人心，並帮助徐州渡過了這次難關。（下文轉入第四版）</p>

<h3 id="c15">淘汰後方的渣滓！ <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>中外記者團訪問徐州前綫歸來，不除在他們的軍事報道裏，或在他們所攝取的新聞照片裏，無不顯示出前綫國軍的士氣旺盛，爲捍衛國家民族而艱苦奮鬥，以及徐州一帶秩序的安全，軍民的配合，遠出後方人民意料之外。這是徐州會戰大捷的基本原因，也就是戡亂軍事前途可以樂觀的重要因素。</p>
<p>但是，儘管前綫的將士拼命作戰，捷報頻傳，而後方的人心，却反惶惶然不可終日，尤其是上層社會的人士，受了共匪和他的第五縱隊謠言攻勢的襲擊，自以爲消息靈通，見解超人一等，抱着「危邦不居」的心理，紛紛携春高飛遠走，有的預備流亡海外，有的想避難香島，而且爭相走告，一傳十，十傳百，一般人心也因「逃難」呼聲而浮動。上層社會的「高等華人」（？）這樣的慌張，這樣的沒出息，那裏還有權利來要求國家和社會爲他們保障其剩餘資產？我們目睹這種「庸人自擾」的情形，再聽到中外記者團異口同聲的報道，眞是百感交集。前方將士艱苦作戰，視死如歸，而後方人民倉皇逃難，爭先恐後，這一個强烈的對照，誠令人啼笑皆非！</p>
<p>實在說來，這些「高等華人」平日養尊處優，頤指氣使，好像整個世界就是他們的；一且國家危急，就先脚底抹油，旣不出力，更不出錢，妄想其他傻子爲他們保護剰餘財產，甚至還夢想派人聯絡，勾搭共匪，預爲保鑣，其執迷不悟，何等荒唐！</p>
<p>在濟南淪陷東北重旗相機棄守之時，後方人民莫不痛心若干守軍未能盡其捍衛國家之天職，有負我後方人民喁喁之望。然而在徐蚌會戰，軍人拼命的今日，若干上層社會的人士，竟置民族國家於不顧，爭相高飛遠走，怎樣對得起前方喋血作戰的將士！這種行爲，不僅暴露出他們自私自利的醜惡，而且足以擾亂人心影響及於前綫的士氣。不論在南京，在上海，這一批只想逃亡毫無貢獻之徒，都是後方的渣滓，國家的蟊賊。我們必須指斥這種自私行爲的可鄙，尤其要勉勵有志氣的後方同胞激發天良，向前綫忠勇將士看齊</p>
<p>政府於抗戰勝利之後，毅然決然，從事剿匪戡亂的戰爭，原與普通國家的內戰以及歷史上的內亂，不能等量齊觀的。共匪的稱兵叛亂，固欲藉其武力以奪取政權，但因其具有國際背景，實爲某國所鼓吹的世界革命的一環。我們人民對此，決不能以民主國家的普通政黨目之，它的成功，就是我民族的失敗；它的勝利，也就是我國家的滅亡。目前共匪的聲勢日大，其所佔據的地盤也日多，甚至其縱橫流竄的部隊，已透入紅淮流域，勢將攻入我政府的心廠。我們雅不欲危言聳聽，更絕對非失敗主義者，但不能不率直指出，刻正在徐蚌之間進行着的大會戰，其勝敗利飩，不僅有關江淮流域的安危，而且對於整個戡亂軍事的前途，實有重大的影響。京滬沿綫的將士與人民，必須一致奮起，密切配合，有錢出錢，有力出力，發揮當年龍潭之役打敗孫傳芳和八一三淞滬之役抵抗日軍三個月之久的堅强精神，自能轉危爲安，保證最後的勝利。</p>
<p>再檢討過去軍事失敗的癥結，一言以蔽之，在於軍隊與人民脫節，甚至彼此互相責難。今後如何挽回軍事的頹勢，首在恢復抗戰期間軍民一體的精神。這次徐州會戰，業已恢復了軍隊的信心，證明軍隊决非不肯打硬仗，故今後母寗多求於後方人民，而尤須首先自動淘汰一切腐敗的渣滓，使整個社會沉着鎭定，支持將士，與匪死拼。我們相信，在軍民合作的條件下，不僅紅淮可守，山東和東北的失地，也不難次第收復。要之，今後我們要挽回軍事的頹勢，加强友邦的援助，爭取最後的勝利，保障國家民族的獨立與自由，其責任就在我們後方人民樹立自救救國的堅强信念！</p>

<p>鄧文儀　發表文吿</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國防部政工局長鄧文儀發表「向前方將士看齊一一文，茲誌於次：</p>
<p>徐州會戰，經過二十天惡戰苦鬥，第一期作戰已吿一段落。不過徐州南面宿縣會戰，仍在繼續中，由於國軍不斷在作週密佈署，在戰鬥中，也許還要延長一個時間，獲致更大的勝利。全國軍民對這一次會戰的關切，或較抗戰初期還有過之，因爲東北的再度淪陷，國家已到危急存亡的最後關頭，如果徐州會戰給共匪僥倖勝利了，京滬以至長江流城就都不免要延到戰爭的災禍。這種嚴重的事實，我認爲在全國軍民的內心裏面都會惑覺到的。</p>
<p>國軍將士在徐州會戰中作戰的英勇和犧牲的壯烈，不是親歷其境，耳聞目見的人，幾乎不易相信，我在徐州住了半個月，曾經幾度到最前綫的陣地視察，在這裏，我想將我親眼看見，及我從受傷官兵和匪軍俘虜的口中所說的事實，很簡單扼要的向全國軍民作一個忠實而正確的報吿。</p>
<p>劉伯承·陳毅與陳賡匪部，在共產國際和共匪中央直接指示之下，發動這一次瘋狂的侵掠的戰事，集中了黃河以南長江以北共匪所有的力量，動員了匪軍五十餘萬，其中陳毅匪所部有十九個縱隊和四個獨立旅，約四十萬人，劉伯承·陳賡所部七個縱隊，三個軍區旅，約十五萬人。但是國眾士氣旺盛，官兵都有必勝的信念和犧牲的決心，加以國軍有空軍配合作戰，終於發揮了偉大的革命精神，擊破了當面匪的主力。</p>
<p>會戰期間，國軍全體官兵確能英勇犧牲，前仆後繼，較之北伐，抗戰中的任何會戰，都有過之無不及徐州及其附近的人民，因受英勇國軍的感召都自動的實施空室淸野，作戰地區老百姓不論男女老幼，都自動離開戰塲，寗願過流亡的難民生活，不願受共匪的脅迫，軍民通力合作再好沒有了。徐州市的四十個市民和十多萬難民，供獻了他們最大的力量，來支援這一次會戰，因爲他都們明白這次戰爭是反侵略反奴役的戰爭，同時也是他們生死存亡的戰爭。</p>
<p>我曾看到和聽到戰塲上的國軍，創造了千百個慷慨赴死從容就義視死如歸的英勇事蹟，一寸河山一寸血的事實，在徐州會戰中又重見了，他們的犧牲是悲壯的，也是慘烈的，他的代價和後果，更是輝煌的遠大的。</p>
<p>會戰的影響和表現</p>
<p>至於這次會戰的影響和表現，簡單說來，約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，由於這次徐州會戰，已經把剿匪戡亂戰爭的眞實意義，很明顯的表現出來了，要不是前綫軍民眞正明白這塲戰爭是與國家民族存亡有直接的關係，我想也許不會這麼快的就獲到這樣大的戰果。由於這種偉大的犧牲所換來的戰果。必將使得全中國的老百姓覺醒，共同起來參加全民族反侵略反奴役，求生存求自由的戰爭，同時也更使全世界的入們明瞭共產國際同中國共匪的陰謀與殘暴，這已是民主國家的戰爭，不祗是中國國內的戰爭了</p>
<p>第二，這次會戰的直接戰果，由於七萬國軍將士傷亡的血，已經粉碎了共匪一舉攻掠徐州的陰謀，打垮了共匪十二個縱隊卅四個師，（其中第七，第十縱隊已完全被我們打垮了），其餘的十多個縱隊，已受嚴重的打擊，匪軍傷亡的總數，根據匪軍縱隊的編併，臨時兵員補充，及戰塲遺屍，同俘虜供稱，至少在廿萬以上，爲國軍傷亡之三倍，爲共匪攻徐州總兵力的五分之二。這將給共匪以嚴重的敎訓，使他們知道中華民族與國軍的精神，不是他們陰謀鼓動欺騙煽惑的手段所能屈服或擊敗的。</p>
<p>第三，這次會戰已經打動了全中國的人心，我們看到會戰中間各地祝捷的熟烈，會戰吿一段落時，各地慰勞運動的發起，盛况空前。京滬兩地在十天內就募集了價値億萬金圓的物資，以作實物慰勞，尤其是京滬各界各黨代表所組織的慰勞第一第二團，迅速到達前綫，作戰官兵除香烟糖菜之外，每一官兵都就地發給慰勞金銀幣兩元，還有香烟糖菜同手套襪子毛巾，對於傷兵招待看護慰問擻勞無所不至，這些事在抗戰時期都不多見，這是前方將士感到十分滿意與欣慰的，這樣的勞軍運動，希望全國普遍發起響應，因爲人人有錢出錢有力出力的時候已經到了。</p>
<p>第四，這次會戰已對全國的人心後方秩序發生安定作用，多數人的驚惶失措，投機取巧，袖手旁觀，幸災樂禍的心理態度改變了，由此知道祗有挺起胸膛，站穩脚跟，同共匪鬥爭，實行破產保產，拼命保命，人無分老幼男女，地無分南北東西，都起來救亡岡存，反共救國，才是生路，今後祗有這一條才是我們的生路。</p>
<p>第五，這次會戰將很快使全世界知道中國今日反侵略的戰爭是過去抗戰的繼續，是爭中國獨立生存而戰，同時也是爲世界自由和平而戰，聯合國應該有所抉擇，英美諸國應有所行動；另一方面，也使共產國際集團知道侵掠中國·赤化中國·滅亡中國。不是容易的事。中國人的忍耐是有限度的，中國軍人還有力量，共產國際同共匪要是得寸進尺，大舉南進，他們一定會受到堅强的抵抗，並遭致我們英勇軍民致侖的打擊。</p>
<p>第六，這次會戰把中國軍人的必勝信念確立了，由於這次勝利也由於這樣重大的流血犧牲，一定可以挽回戰局，挽陳乾坤，最高統帥蔣總統的英明領導是値得全國軍民忠誠擁戴的，軍人的信心從此恢復了，不管共匪怎樣誣蔑毀謗我革命軍人，我們現在已用事實與行動答復了他們，國家興亡，軍人之責，國軍祗有恢復革命精神，發揚光榮歷更，以承先啟後，繼往開來的態度，來爭取這次戰爭的澈底勝利，效法徐外會戰官兵的英勇戰鬥，踏着先烈的血蹟前進，不成功卽成仁，這是轉敗爲勝，轉守爲攻，戡平匪亂，救亡圖存的好榜樣。徐州會戰是中國獨立戰爭最好的一次模範戰役。</p>
<p>由於以上這些事實同影響，我們就可瞭然徐州會戰的價値，將士的血不是白流的，希望全國軍人加緊學習徐州會戰的敎訓，創造更輝煌的戰蹟，全國同胞，珍視徐州會戰的價値，趕快動員參戰，和皮持剿匪戰爭，全國軍民都向前方將士看齊，努力的看齊！</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎一日電〕英美法三强一日昭吿蘇聯及世界，由於蘇聯單方面分裂柏林，故三國保留全部權利，可採取任何行動以便續留粕林。三國之言不啻承認柏林問題已無法解決。三國於三十日晚趁阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞安理會主席任期未滿前，以聯合文吿一份交勃氏，表示三國之立塲。其時適在勃氏主張設置特種技術委會研究柏林之幣制及貿易問題前。三西方國家之文吿稱，「西方三國絕不間意應服從蘇方加强柏林封鎖或干涉市政之舉措而任蘇聯不受任何束縛。故三國政府再度重申本案提交安理會時之保留權利聲明如下：「將採一切必需步驟俾在此情况下維持三國在柏林之地位。」三國亦指稱，自十月廿五日以來，蘇聯「不斷採取壓制市政府之其他行動，致該市日形分裂。」西方國家稱，歡迎勃氏之委負會「研究」柏林幣制貿易問題，然又稱，在研究後決議提交安理會時，將保留其地位。三國稱，擬「根據委員會之報吿及屆時一般情形考慮委會之決議。」三國重申堅持蘇聯十月廿五日否決之安理會決議，然强調稱，任何解決方案應認淸蘇聯分剖柏林之單方面行動。由於此一文吿及與西方代表之口頭交換，勃氏卅日晚乃修改其建議。勃氏發表文吿稱，柏林危機僅係世界鬥爭中之「單純小接觸」而樂觀地預測必可解決。「欲解決此事起見，行動時不應魯莾，不應過高估計分歧之因素，而應認一切爲偶發事件，充滿信心，以了解及誠意解決此問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎一日電〕法官方發言人今日宣稱，蘇聯外次維辛斯基已向勃拉馬格里亞提出覆文，接受調解柏林爭端折衷方案。布氏卽擬着手組織專家委員會，立卽設法草擬柏林問題解決辦法，然後於三十日之內向安理會提出報吿。</p>

<p>同時，親共份子十萬名在蘇軍區開會，會中有人演說擁護新政權，斥責柏林西區市政府。共產政權出現後，柏林市政從此正式分裂。共產政權包含社會統一黨·天主敎民主黨·社會民主黨。與自由民主黨之分裂份子。市長爲艾自特，現年五十四歲，乃第一次世界大戰後威瑪共和國首任總統之子，另設副市長三人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林三十日電〕蘇區選舉「臨時民主市政府」事，引起西德盟軍與德當局之密切注意。美軍政付發言人稱，「在柏林我人僅知有一個市府，卽在一九四四六年所選出者，且在下星期日（西區選舉）前我人仍承認其有權力」。柏林美軍司令霍萊亦發表公報，同意上述之見解。現任柏林市府發表公報稱，「所有新選出之市政府官員，均爲違法者，將根據法律予以制裁」.又謂，「柏秣市政府仍將照常辦公，並呼籲柏林市民參加十二月五日之選舉，以答覆是項對自由統一之襲擊」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午五時，在市府會議室茶會歡迎京滬衛戍總司令湯恩伯，及淞滬警備司令陳大慶上任，到潘公展，方治，査良鑑，劉鴻生，梅蘭芳，兪叔平，張曉崧顏惠慶·趙曾玨，田永　，沈宗濂，水祥雲，陸京士，周學湘，郁秉堅，閔湘軓，項昌權，陶百川，陶一珊，程滄波，馮有真等各界人士數十人。首由吳市長介紹湯總司令及陳司令與各界相見，旋請湯總司令致詞略稱：本人今日欲發表之意見計四點：（一）目前京滬兩地人心浮動已極，對戰事局勢咸抱悲觀，其實中國問題卽是世界問題，須從分析及檢討整個世界問題中求解答，故今日之危局絕非單純中國問題，須由全世界之總淸算中判其成敗。（二）抗戰勝利迄今已三年，政府不論在政治，經濟，軍事上固然均有缺點，然造成今日困難局面者，由於八年抗戰將元氣損傷，而正當抗戰勝利人民渴求安定之際，共匪搗亂繼起，使建設工作無法推進，故目前種種缺點純係環境所造成。如抗戰勝利以後無共匪作戰，則局勢決不至此，爲此，欲建國必須先戡亂。（三）如何發揮力量集中意志完成任務。上海是全國最大都市，人力物力均極充足，如能羣策羣力，充分發揮上海力量，則非惟上海可保安逸，全國亦可安逸。（四）聞最近上海有資力者均紛紛逃難，工廠亦在南遷，造成這種現象的原因固多，希望能加以硏究後制止之，因如資力及生產事業逃避，絕非上海之福，更非國家之福，望市政當局須設法安定人心，繼續生產。</p>
<p>希望市民勿信謠言</p>
<p>繼由陳司令致詞略稱：本人是個軍人，此次服從中央命令來滬任命，對上海情形素不明瞭，實無任何意見貢獻各界，本人僅知警備司令部責在維持治安與秩序，確保上海之安全。本部同人固須負起責任全力苦幹，惟心理建設及精神武裝亦屬重要望上海人切勿聽信謠言，輕舉妄動，警備司令部爲保障治安，非特對匪徒予以嚴懲，對妨害治安之一切非法行動均在糾正之列。八一三時，上海曾有過光榮歷史，如四行孤軍事件曾令人歌頌一時，希望仍能以此種精神保衛上海。最後本人願在湯總司令領導及各界協助之下，盡力爲上海服務。</p>
<p>繼由國民黨方主委報吿赴徐州勞軍經過，陳司令報吿濟南淪入匪區後之情形，最後由程滄波建議當局必須迅卽設法安定人心，以挽大局，茶會於六時半散。</p>

<p>復蘇狀態　從上月廿五日起，徐州一切漸漸恢復正常，陽光普照，寒意漸減，商店什九開門營業，菜塲攤販處人頭擁擠，街頭一片熱鬧景象，稍能冲淡一些戰時的肅殺景象。可是一到晚間，情形就大不相同，戒嚴官從晚間六時開始，路上行人全無，情景廣絕。同時由於徐州的用電向由賈汪電廠供給，賈汪未收復前，徐市一到夜問，除剿總自行發電外，全城仍是黑暗世界，街頭禁備森嚴，一切情景使來自後方都市的人，感到江南的生活方式，實在經不起這個時代的嚴酷考騐。</p>
<p>因爲徐州是個圍城，物資的補充困難，所以物價較後方爲高。在記者離徐前夕，白米售價是每担五百元左右，麵粉每包二百元，靑菜每斤四元，猪肉每斤十四元，鷄蛋每枚三元，土產的碭山梨亦買到每斤十六元。工業成。因來源遠在外埠，售價更高，白錫包香烟要賣到廿元一包，火柴每盒六七角，次等貨的肥皂四元買一塊。上海慰勞團和記者團對於抑平徐市的物價，亦盡了一點微力，因爲他們帶去了不少的報紙，證實上海等地是在無限制兌出黃金和銀元，大家對於金圓券的信心陡然提高，物價普跌了三成。據調査所得，徐市的金銀價格，遠在京滬之上。例如上月廿日徐州的黃金，舊價高至每兩六千元，但是上海的暗盤，不過一千八百元而已，相差三倍以上。銀圓最高的價目是六十元，一等到上海兌出的消息證實，一度跌到三十五元，但是一兩日內，又回漲到四十元以上了。中國人有的是商業頭腦，這種好生意自有特殊人物在做呢！</p>
<p>到上月月底爲止，徐市的金融機關，除中中交農已恢復營業外，其他的商業銀行依然在休息狀態中·黨地共有銀行十八家，信用合作社六家。據深知內情者談，所有商業銀行全有後台撑腰，他們有的是機關公款，拿到黑市去放高利貸。來存的款子名義上是五分，事實上要出到一角五分，銀行吃進這些款子後，至少要以三角錢的利率拆給商人，而商人至少要每月的貨價高五分，才能不虧本。於是利息和物價，相互追逐，其影響所及，首先是公款拿來生息，士兵的生活大受影響，其次是當地的土產價格，影饗一般的民生。如果他們不回來重振旗鼓，一般小民的生活也許可以過得舒適些。</p>
<p>圍城命運　在東綫吿捷之後，徐市各機關首長曾舉行聯席會議，商討如何使當地情形恢復正常。結果決定幾項辦法：例如請航空公司恢復徐州的客機，以安定人心；請當地國家銀行復業，准許一千元以下款項的匯兌，以安定在徐工作人員眷屬的生活。同時並令劇院復業，使一般人民能在業餘有娛樂可消遣，戰時的緊張心理可在不知不覺中消失，間接亦可安定人心。這些辦法在當時都相當收效，不過在現在說來，又是成爲明日黃花了。因爲戰局南移後，徐州成了一座掉在後面的國城，今後的命運尙難加以預測，因為軍事本身就是最變化莫測的。據一位高級軍官分析，要使徐州的安全有保障，北要推進至兗州，西要奪回開封，而國軍確實有此計劃。當然，這個計劃是否能實現，完全要取決於蚌宿會戰了。記得在兩年之前，全面戡亂軍事展開時，國軍當時就以徐州爲基地，集中近百萬的兵力，北上山東，直搗濟南的；兩年後之今日，想不到徐州竟成孤城。在徐州古戰塲上，檢討兩年來的國事，眞使人感慨萬端。不過，同時看到徐州的芸芸衆生，能帶着笑容渡過難關，好像對剛才過去的危難已完全忘懷，又覺得中國的一般人民的生命力特强，能和任何逆境相週旋，國家在目前，雖不容諱言是漆黑一片，但仍是有它的出路的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕東華東星兩足球隊，昨日在南市體育塲作紀念足球表演賽，爲國光社慶祝成立十五週年紀念，東華息影已久，今年正式初次露險，大吉路畔，球迷擁塞，四座客滿，觀衆五千人，開南市體育塲未有之紀錄。東華因久未臨陣，球藝較爲生疏，射門機會雖多，上半時攻勢猛烈，異球運不佳，僅獲中一球。東星以全力上陣，前綫有張吉良，姜琨，陳勤，合作甚佳，後衛復得名將吳祺祥助陣，後防鞏固，使東華左翼，失去活動，上半時一比一，下半時東星連勝兩球以三此擊敗東華，可稱難得。</p>
<p>過程相當精彩</p>
<p>比賽過程，相當精彩，尤以上半時，勢均力敵，各有妙球，互中一球，但射擊極度精彩，四座球迷較好不絕。東星守勝於攻，故上半時在東華環攻之下，能保不失，吳祺祥王寶山閻承寬俱應居功。東華久疏球場，未能充份發揮，右翼陳明哲，數度衝刺傳送攻射，確見有相當進步。韓龍海李堯一再進襲，功虧一簣，不勝可惜。張林根鎭守發關，救險不少。</p>
<p>各一未分勝負</p>
<p>三時半開賽裁判陳福寳巡邊臧文彬·王琳。雙方接觸，東華攻勢甚盛。十分鐘時，龍海斜射，來勢兇險，閻承寬躍起，未曾抱住，但天佑東星，竟中橫木彈出，鄭秉彝一脚勾消。廿分鐘時，東星進攻，張吉良中路突入，起脚拉門，張林根連忙救駕，力挽狂瀾。此時東星攻勢，如潮湧至。廿三分鐘時，張吉良在難門廿碼，突然射門，張邦綸撲救不及，竟穿網而過，一比〇東星先勝一球。東華敗後，豈肯罷休，賈幼良揮軍進攻，陳明哲沿邊直下，龍海頭攻未中，東星後衛擋出，仍入龍海脚下，認門猛射，應聲入網，東華於三分鐘內，扳成平局。此後雙方仍互有攻勢，但均未有建樹，上半時以一比一終塲。</p>
<p>東華飮恨塲</p>
<p>休息過後，易地交兵，東華陣容不變。東星調兵易將，姚慶昇調出夏樹福，王步榮調出張金根。兩陣再圓，東華仍取猛烈之攻勢，四分鐘時，錢長榮妙傳李垚，切入射門，不料正射在閻承寬身上。十分鐘後，錢允慶亦來叩關，一飛冲天。賈幼良拉門，亦未中的，東華屢次進攻，均未有所獲。東星努力進攻，十九分鐘時，王步榮迫得角球，右脚開來恰好，姜琨力衝，老鐔力拒，同入網窩，皮球亦被帶進，二比一東星又勝一球。東華噩運未已，三分鐘後，王步榮又竄入傳中，陳勤門前順水推舟，三比一·此後，東華竭力反攻，東星門前，彈如雨下，但閻承寬如有神助，一一救出，暮色蒼茫中，東華飮恨終塲。</p>

<p>男子比賽登塲，由兪一會見稼·王爲公執法，約翰孫摩西先破籃圏，莊逸榮。吳新運相繼施威，轉瞬卽以九比〇佔先，大夏呼停無効。孫摩西·黃天烈又報中鵠，大夏全力反攻，余祖復·楊鴻鈞雙雙命中，局勢仍爲約翰所控制，大夏僅賴遠射得分，上半時約翰三十三，大夏十四。下半時約翰盡量調用新將，大夏稍見起色，孫咸熙運得六分，戰局漸趨緊張，但未幾約翰又再逞威，王恭森屢得孫歷西妙傳，頻頻中的。大夏呼停，翰約鋒芒，仍未稍遏，韋尙溥三投三中，錢士均兩施妙射，胡思慶籃下托入，銀笛長鳴，約翰以六十六比三十二大勝</p>

<p>— 本報記者劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿八日快訊〕江西「老俵」，在遍地烽火的今日雖然沒有直接聞到火藥氣味，但是，他們早已披上了戎衣，凖備着戰爭的來臨。上次熊式輝氏在家鄉所倡導的「有糧出糧，有兵出兵」的號召，更是加深了江西今日的戰時景色。</p>
<p>「贛糧」，現在成爲支持前方戡亂的重要軍精，來源地區，甚至還要供鄰省以至華北的民食，省政當局爲了征糧，幾乎成爲今日江西施政上的一大部份工作，不但田賦管理處祖負了整個「征借採購」任務，其他各廳處的主管與省委，亦不斷在外縣坐征嚴催。</p>
<p>但是，今年江西對中央的</p>
<p>糧食供應負荷</p>
<p>相當加重，江西今年田賦比額，是征實三斗，征借二斗二升五，公糧一斗五，優待穀一升，自治捐榖九升，每元折合七斗七升五，除征借全歸中央外，征實部份所得，有五成留縣，三成歸中央，三成屬省，公糧部份是省縣各半。現在除如幕阜山區的修水銅彭與梅嶺山區的定南等交通不便縣份折征國幣外、其他各縣早已開征，全省征實征借的總額，照中央的規定，是：征實二百七十萬石，征借二百零三萬元，公糧按照征借征實的總額三成，計一百四十二萬石。此外，尙有自治捐榖，優待榖，以及各縣的學榖捐。</p>
<p>中央在江西採購的軍糧，更是加車了老俵們的負荷，雖然軍糧係屬備價採購，但是採購機關爲了要從速達成任務，事實上不允　在市塲上一祖兩祖的按照市價收買，所以仍然由省軍糧採購處將今年一百萬大包的配額，按照</p>
<p>有糧縣份分配</p>
<p>由各縣政府去辦理，現在中央對於軍糧，是十萬火急的向省田糧處催購催運。最近並由中央糧食會議決定：本年在江西追加四十萬大包，兩共一百四十萬大包米，折榖爲三百七十三萬三千石，除原配額一百萬大包，折榖二百六十六萬七千石，業經決定配購省級公糧四十萬石，縣級公糧八十萬石，市塲採購一百四十六萬七千石。至於新增配的四十萬大包，亦經決定再收購省糧榖十萬石，由財政廳與軍糧採購處商定交通便利縣份，飭縣自十一月份起至明年六月底止，分爲六個月，以本年賦榖平均交撥，收購縣糧廿萬石，亦自十一月份起至明年六月，平均配購。其餘的七十六萬六千石，則在市塲採購，在產糧縣份，分組軍糧採購分處，負責辦理。</p>
<p>現在，中央嚴飭省田糧處，本年所應征收的田賦與採購的軍糧，統限本年十一月底以前，交足七成，十二月底掃數解足。</p>
<p>在戡亂期間軍事第一的前提下，軍糧的供應，是後方每個有糧的老百姓應盡的義務，同時，江西今年是被中央劃爲糧產增產縣份，中央的人。財。都集中了一部份，直接在江西，劃定吉安·南昌·臨川等十餘縣爲糧食增產區城，據一位掌農事者談：今年</p>
<p>糧食增產工作</p>
<p>因爲經費遲遲撥到，而辦事人員又是遲遲的進行，以致延誤時機，尤其是經費一項，不能整數一次撥足，農戶領到後，未能當作專用，更失時效，所以荒亦不能開，墾亦不能殖，僅能在農村减輕一部份的靑苗錢，高利貸的剝削。</p>
<p>所以今年江西的糧產，雖然得到中央一部份的補助，未發實效，復遭各地水災，收成銳减，以早稻的收成當作八成，可能尙不及去年七五·七一八·八〇六石，若以八成計算，僅爲六〇·三七五·〇四五石。再依據全省</p>
<p>人民的消耗量</p>
<p>去年的總消費量爲八〇·一二八·八·九八三石，今年照下列估計爲六六·八〇八·六四九石。（二）民食，去年民食係以人口一二·五〇五·八〇八口，按每人年食稻榖六石計算，約需七五·一三四·八四八石。今年人口數，根據民政廳卅七年六月統計爲一二·四五五·〇一三口，遵照糧食部規定：每人年食稻榖五石計算，需榖六二·二七五石（二）留存種籽，去年留存種籽數爲三〇六·五八四石。今年同。（三）外運軍糧，去年爲一·七一〇·五五一石，今年外運軍糧，（中央應得田賦征實三成，征借全部）爲一·六〇〇·〇〇〇石，（四）採購軍糧，去年採購軍糧總數爲三·一六七·〇〇〇石，今年以省府奉令購辦軍糧數爲二·六六七·〇〇〇石，所以江西糧食的產銷，以軍糧民食和明年的種籽總數相抵，尙不足六，二七三·六〇四石。幸今年秋收，如晚稻。雜糧等收入相當豐饒，估計全省總產量爲一五·七八五·六六九石，一部份江西農村的民食，是要以雜糧來補助稻榖的不足。</p>

<h3 id="c118">共產主義在中國　（二） <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>在一九四五年以前，中共和莫斯科的接觸因交通困難而受到嚴重的阻碍。然而中共始終能和全世界的共產黨保持着密切的聯緊。中共領袖份子數百人曾先後到莫斯科去，大都在那裏受到高深的訓練。一九三五年共產國際召開第七屆全世界共產黨大會時，當選的四十七個執行委員中有三個是中國共產黨員。這個委員會關係非常重大，所以史達林自已和日丹諾夫也都是執行委員。此外國際監察委員會二十個委員中有一個是中國共產黨員。執行委員會主席團十九人中也有一位中共代表。史達林自己也是主席團中的一份子。中國共產黨也和世界上其他任何共產黨一樣，是全世界共產黨的一個支部。這在中國共產黨和共產國際的歷史上都有紀錄可以稽考，無論在學說和政策上，在組織上，在人事上，在行動上都是一樣的。從這篇研究的下半部可以看出這個紀錄不因任何變化而被打破。使人覺得奇怪的不是：他們是不是眞正的共產黨？而是：爲什麽熟悉內情而有誠意的人士會提出這個問題來？共產黨從來沒有提出這個問題過。</p>
<p>無論在那一國家，主義，預言和命令必須適合當地的情形。中國共產黨的行爲只像中國共產黨，而不像法國共產黨。但是在若干旁觀者看來雖似複雜，局部的不同並不和大體的一致相抵觸。</p>
<p>乙　共產黨眼裏的中國</p>
<p>列寗曾在一九一三年寫過有趣的短文，論及中國的重要性和可能隨蘇聯革命而來的亞洲革命運動的發展，但是在一九一七年蘇俄革命以後的若千年中，列寗的同志們沒有時間考慮到中國問題。蘇俄的內戰，外國的干涉，以及把革命勢力伸張到歐洲去的希望，使他們無暇他顧。但是當西方局勢平定以後，他們就把視綫轉移到中國來。一九一一年中國發生革命，但是很顯明的這次革命並沒有完成。列寗攫取機會使一個落後國家的中產階級的革命在一年中間一變而爲「無產階級專政」，這種功績鼓勵人們對其他落後國家或殖民地區發生類似革命的可能性，作種種空洞的夢想。中國似乎是共產黨的一個最初的機會。</p>
<p>中國對世界共產主義的重要性，不難加以估量。第一，共產黨異常重視中國，當一九二七年世界共產主義遭遇空前嚴重的內部危機—史達林與托洛茨基的分裂時，中國變成了一個主要的問題。第二，中國是區域廣大而共產勢力强盛的唯一國家，因此共產黨無須全國性的政府，只須自已組織的軍隊，便可以對一個廣大的地區長期控制着。第三，共產主義在比較落後的國家，機會一天比一天優越，在前進的工業國家，機會一天比一天减少。中國是工業落後，政治獨立的唯一大國，對於共產黨恰好是試驗共黨理論，戰略與戰術發展到全世界各工業落後國家的實騐工廠和試騐塲所。這些國家恰巧佔有了全世界人口的四分之三。爲求澈底了解起見，我們必須對中國的特性作簡略的剖析。</p>
<p>丙　中國的剖視</p>
<p>中國是擁有大川巨河，農業發達，農民以數萬萬計的一個大國。中國有很多的傳統，被歷代的學者和藝術家小心地保持下來。它是舊的解體和新的結晶同時進行的一個國家。不過我們此刻所關心的中國是世界問題存亡所緊的一個國家。</p>
<p>第一，中國是人類文化與文明三大中心之一，已有三千年歷史。其他兩個中心是印度和歐洲。在本世紀以前，中國文化的嬗變是比較迂緩的。第二，中國有廣大的土地，中國的較高的文化水凖支持了它的實力，使它保持着廣大的土地，雖在國勢衰弱時期，一度被異族所征服，但終究能併吞它的征服者。第三，中國直到十九世紀——約較歐洲文藝復與時期遲四百年——纔開始應用工藝和工業力，有着生產和組織的規模。這就是說：西方各國發展成一種適應變化或進步的政治制度要經過幾世紀，但是中國接受西方的新工業，必須接納經過數世紀發展而成的產物，而沒有充分的時問使其適應政治環境。歐洲以十六世紀的政治來應付十六世紀的進步，以十八世紀的政治來應付十八世紀的進步。但是中國却須以十五世紀的政治來應付十九世紀的進步。</p>
<p>立憲政府，現代立法，政黨，多數黨統治，和國家團結等的發展，在西方是在十九和二十世紀民主勢力膨大以前經過三世紀的演變的。在中國這些早期的工作還沒有準備好，卽須和我們的後期工作同時進行。</p>
<p>同時，中國的社會依舊停留在人民思想的勢力較西方爲强而政府組織較西方爲弱的階段。這情形恰恰有利於共產主義，它的苦心孤詣野心勃勃的學說，凖備出售給搜求新學說以代替舊學說的任何人。</p>
<p>關於中國的第四件重要的事實便是：中國未被西方文明所淹沒過。在過去四世紀中能不受歐洲影響而在政治和法律上繼續保持獨立的，不過極少數的小國。中國是能够保持文化獨立的唯一的大國。它旣不能被任何異族所征服，亦不能被分裂。沒有僑民能在中國立脚，繁衍，並排擠土人，儀英國在美洲所做的那樣。</p>
<p>要而言之，中國正在檀變的過程中，逍些變化在歐洲要經過五倍多的時問。一個習慣於傳統政府的社會，現在要勉力組織創造性的機構。一個不諳早期科學的社會硬要把後期科學囫園吞下去。產生西方現代政府的長期的試騐過程，是太迂緩了，不能直接抄襲或縮短的。中國必須棄置傳統的勢力，甚至放棄對於傳統的信念。</p>
<p>以上所講的都是關於中國本身。但是適用於中國的，也必然適用於中國人。個人的性格並不完全和他的國家的性格相伺。國家在打仗的時候，人民還是愛好和平的。中國的農民大都不識字。他知道任何一個朝代終必有覆亡的一天，他從傳說中知道歷史上的英雄不全是好的，也不全是壞的。他反對討人厭煩而懷有惡意的任何事物，外國人首當其衝。再如中國的小市民，人力車夫，開店的老　，或機器工匠，他識得幾十個字或幾百個字。他把他的職業，他的地位，他的安定的生活歸功於他的家庭，他的公所，或他的同鄕會。他感到通貨膨脹和物價管制的壓迫，而能應付裕如。他沒有信任政治前途的理智。</p>
<p>他是脚踏實地的，國家的團結對於他只是一個抽象觀念。他覺得中國還沒有達到西方國家的地步，他認爲中國還不能適用自由選舉的多數人統治。他不懂得法律可以立法的決定爲根據。他會受遊擊暴動的鼓動，必要時可以棄農從戎。當他發覺舊的信仰不能保護他時，他會投入新的信仰中去。</p>

<p>共產主義最初傳到中國時，中國已把滿淸帝國推翻（一九一一年）。這次的革命遭遇到多數民主革命同樣的命運，它無法把中國人民改造成一個現代的政治社會。那時中國被眾閥割據着，北京政府的權力不能達到大部份的區械。</p>
<p>孫中山領導國民黨推進革新運動，三民主義是他所倡導的學說的中心思想。他明白排斥馬克思共產主義，認爲馬克思的「辯證法的唯物論」是一種錯誤的歴史觀。除此以外，三民主義很易被共產黨所曲解，而自稱忠於這一個主義。</p>
<p>一九二〇年初，有自稱共產黨者七人聯合陳獨秀敎授，在上海出版無產階級報紙，並開始組織工會。其後北京·漢口及其他城市發現同樣的組織。</p>
<p>一九二一廿七月，中國馬克思主義者在上海舉行第一屆大會，正式成立共產黨。這新政黨很怏地成長起來，在一年中已經確定了它的身份，得以加入共產國際。蘇俄的布爾雪維克政府隨卽派遣特務人員到中國來。一九二三年九月莫斯科派遣鮑羅廷至廣州。他吿訴莫斯科說，孫中山領導的國民黨是中國革命勢力最有希望的推動者，因此莫斯科決定支持這一個政黨。中國共產黨運從這個決議，在共產國際的指導與援助下，採取了和國民黨統一戰綫的政治路綫。</p>
<p>乙　第一次統一戰綫—一九二四年至一九二七年</p>
<p>一九二四年國民黨改組，與共產黨合作，允許共產黨負以個人資格加入國民黨。於是全國統一戰綫遂在鮑羅廷和孫中山兩人的擘劃下成爲了事實。這是一個爲達到全國統一目的的聯盟，爲促進兩黨未來目標的必要的第一步驟。</p>
<p>列寗在其所著「左翼共產主義」一書中規定共產黨不能和改良運動隔離，必須參加這些運動，但不能放棄他們的最終目標。因此列密所規定的共產黨的作風是介乎「改良主義」與「左傾主義」之間。這是共產黨統一戰綫策略的基礎。</p>
<p>共產黨所選擇的合作對象，在工業國家是社會黨，在非工業國家是國家主義運動。在中國，左右大局的間題是反帝國主義和國民政府的發展，中國遂成爲共產黨對非工業國家戰略的化驗爐子。</p>
<p>最初，和國民黨合作的中共和蘇聯顧問，對於國民革命運動確有很大價値，但在一九二五年三月十二日孫中山逝世以後，統一戰綫便開始顯露了裂痕。孫先生的「老同志」們，不滿於革命運動中少壯派的勢力擴張，於十二月間召開西山會議，要求排除國民黨中的共產黨員，辭退鮑羅廷和其他蘇聯顧問，國民黨執行委員會會址自廣州遷移至上海。國民黨最高當局一面對右派的此種單獨行動加以譴責，一而在蔣介石的督促下採取步驟以防止左派的可能的打擊。當時國民黨正擬對北方軍閥發動大規模的討伐，不能立刻就和共產黨決絕。</p>
<p>第一次國共統一戰綫歷時僅三年，自一九二四年至一九二七年夏問，此後卽重行分裂。</p>
<p>丙　蘇聯與中國</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰以後若干年中，蘇聯想利用中國國內的混亂情形獲取漁利，竭力在中國表現它的反帝國主義理論和實際行動。這在分裂的中國顯得是一種複雜的政策，有時候還是矛盾政策。</p>
<p>一九二三年一月二十六日共產國際駐華代表越飛（Joffe）與孫中山在上海發表聯合聲明，大意說共產主義或蘇維埃制度不適於中國國情，認為中國最迫切的問題是求國家的統一和獨立，因此越飛保證中國將獲得蘇聯人民的同情和蘇聯政府的支持。此外，蘇聯願放棄俄皇時代對滿洲的要求，並聲明蘇聯無意分割中國之外蒙古。蘇聯的這兩種利益，於一九四五年雅爾達會議中復被確定，並得美國之承認。</p>
<p>在此協定締結以後十六個月，卽一九二四年五月三十一日，蘇聯和北平政府簽訂條約，互相保證在各該國國境內不得有反對對方政府的團體存在，任何一國政府不得從事反對對方政治或社會制度的宣傳。這一條約同樣聲明放棄併吞蒙古的利益，並保證交還租借地。因此蘇聯受條約的拘束，不得不對中國內戰的雙方保持友好和忠實的態度。</p>
<p>一九二七年在蔣介石領導下的南京國民政府並沒有和蘇聯恢復外交關係。共產黨雖於一九三一年在共產國際的指揮和贊助下在華中成立了一個弱小而獨立的政府，但沒有得到蘇聯外交上的承認。相反地，當中共公然譴責蔣介石和國民黨之際，蘇聯却於一九三二年十二月十二日和國民政府恢復了外交關係。而且當蔣氏領導中國對日抗戰期問，蘇聯曾對國民政府而不是對共產政府給予物質的援助。</p>
<p>丁　第一次反共內戰</p>
<p>國民黨軍隊於一九二六年七一月開始北伐以後，節節勝利，於一一九二七年春間到達長江，先後一克復京滬。當時國軍紀律甚好，但若干共黨勢力强盛的師團在南京違反紀律，大施刦掠，對外僑及資產階級人士施以暴行。這是統一戰棧建立以後第一次發生的事態，明白地暴露出共產黨的目的和方法。統一戰綫就在這時宣告解體。</p>
<p>在共黨勢力支配下的廣州政府遷到了武漢去。在北方指揮眾隊的蔣介石，在南昌及南京先後設置獨立的大本營。四月間蔣氏猛力打繫上海和其他各控制區的共產黨，行動迅速而慘烈。</p>
<p>武漢政府勢力日漸衰微，七月間共產黨員叛離了武漢，和自長江及北方南竄的共產黨員會合，控制了一個小小區域，組織軍隊，成立蘇維埃政府，實行急進們的軍隊祇有一萬人，到了一九三〇年已增到加六萬二千人。九三一年他們召開共產黨大會，制定蘇維埃中國憲法。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Ningxia Cavalry and Infantry Elite Force Recovers Baotou; National Army Achieves Great Victory on Zhangjiakou's Outer Periphery; Communist Bandit's Conspiracy to Isolate Beiping and Tianjin Smashed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 1st Dispatch] The National Army advancing towards Baotou along the western section of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway crossed Saxian on the 27th and continued advancing rapidly westward. The Ningxia cavalry and infantry elite force in the west advanced directly towards Baotou with thunderous force. At 4 PM on the 29th, the National Army arrived on the outskirts of Baotou and immediately began the attack. The remaining bandits in the city fought desperately in the night. After a fierce attack by the National Army, they finally entered the city. The remaining bandits fled in disarray along the Yellow River to the south. Baotou City, which had fallen to the bandits on October 23rd, finally saw the light of day again. Furthermore, a dispatch from Gui Sui on the 1st reports that our troops sweeping through southern Suiyuan recovered Tuoxian county seat on the 30th, annihilating bandits retreating southward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st Dispatch] The defensive battle on the outer periphery of Zhangjiakou, due to the successful major battles fought by the National Army at Kongjiazhuang (30 li west of Zhangjiakou) and Wanquan, had achieved a complete victory by approximately 3 PM on the 1st. The defeated bandits are splitting into groups and fleeing towards Laobeihekou (north of Wanquan), Huangjiabao (west of Wanquan), and the mountainous areas west of Huangjiabao. The fighting has now entered the mopping-up stage. This time, the Communist bandits exhausted their wounded remnants that had infiltrated Suiyuan, claiming to be the main force of the First, Second, and Sixth Columns, vainly attempting to infiltrate Zhangjiakou and isolate Beiping and Tianjin. Now, suffering this crushing defeat, their wild conspiracy has been completely shattered. According to preliminary statistics, in this battle, over 5,000 bandit officers below the rank of brigade commander were killed. The war booty is currently being tallied.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhangjiakou, 1st Dispatch. The National Army annihilated bandits on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou. At around 1 AM on the 30th, a group of bandits disturbing the territory of Wanquan County launched a surprise attack on the National Army's position 5 li northwest of Pingmen outside Zhangjiakou City. After a fierce battle lasting about 2 hours, the remnant bandits, except for those who were annihilated on the spot, all fled.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Army deployed on the outer periphery of Zhangjiakou recovered Guoleizhuang (60 li west of Zhangjiakou) on the afternoon of the 1st. Furthermore, the Beiping-Zhangjiakou Railway was cleared on the 30th without obstruction. Passenger and freight trains departing from Beiping on the 1st headed east and are expected to arrive here at 6 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Communist Bandits Attacking Miyun in Northern Hebei Repelled; National Army at Gubeikou Transfers to More Advantageous Defensive Position <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tongxian, 1st Dispatch] Military News: On the 30th, the Lin Biao 11th Column, numbering over a thousand and equipped with several artillery pieces, attacked the outer periphery of Miyun. They engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops overnight. At dawn today, they were repelled by the National Army. The remnant bandits fled in a northeast direction. The National Army is currently pursuing them. Since the strategic value of Gubeikou has become a thing of the past after the initiative withdrawal to protect Chengde, the National Army there safely transferred to a more advantageous defensive position on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tongxian, 30th Dispatch] The great battle in eastern Hebei is still showing no signs of breaking out. The movements of the bandit army are still in the preparatory stage: (1) The communist bandits in the plains of Sanhe, Yutian, Fengrun, Lulong, Qian'an, etc., are using communication trenches to intensify their repairs, attempting to conceal their movements. (2) In the mountainous regions of Longmalanyu, Panshan in Zunhua, Yanshan in Jixian, and Pinggu, they are hastily digging anti-aircraft positions, making them enduring strongholds. (3) In order to inflate their strength, the bandits have greatly expanded their designations, such as county detachments being renamed guerrilla brigades and guard regiments being renamed guard brigades. According to a certain observer, the communist bandits in eastern Hebei currently claim to have eight columns, with a troop strength of approximately 100,000. This is still far behind the strength of the National Army, and they are frequently bombed and suppressed by the National Army's land and air forces, making their movements feel constantly threatened. Therefore, there are still no signs that a major battle will erupt in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Madame Chiang Arrives in Washington; Mrs. Marshall and Others Greet Her at the Airport; H.H. Kung Visits Truman for Secret Talks <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Washington, 1st Broadcast: Madame Chiang arrived here at 10 AM on the 1st from San Francisco aboard President Truman's special plane, the "Sacred Cow." Mrs. Marshall, Ambassador Wellington Koo, and other embassy personnel were at the airport to greet her. When Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall walked to the car, Mrs. Marshall asked, "Do you want to make a statement?" Madame Chiang replied, "No." Madame Chiang only stayed at the airport for a brief moment, waiting for news reporters to take photographs. After that, she and Mrs. Marshall drove to Marshall's private residence in Fauquier County, Virginia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st Dispatch] Madame Chiang is scheduled to stay in the United States for two weeks. Her itinerary has not been finalized, but she has been invited to stay at the home of Secretary of State Marshall and his wife in Leesburg, Virginia (built in the 18th century) for the first few days. Marshall himself has entered Walter Reed Hospital for a medical examination and will be hospitalized for at least a few days. As of now, Madame Chiang has not scheduled a meeting with Marshall or President Truman. American officials will naturally treat the wife of a head of state with courtesy. American officials believe that Madame Chiang's trip is not only to appeal for American government assistance but also to encourage the American people to pay more attention to China's position. At this time, Truman and Marshall seem to have agreed that it is inconvenient to involve the United States deeply in China's civil war. A cautious and limited aid plan still seems possible, but it is still undecided whether this plan will strongly aid the Chinese government. The American authorities believe that regardless of what kind of assistance Chiang receives, there is not much confidence in whether she can restore her power. The Chinese Embassy has also been unable to provide much information about Madame Chiang's itinerary. A press conference may be held once, but this is still awaiting her final decision. Madame Chiang will spend most of her time here at the Washington residence of T.V. Soong, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, as her office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 30th, United Press Dispatch] After an 8,000-mile flight on an American naval aircraft, Madame Chiang Kai-shek landed at the naval air station approximately 30 miles south of San Francisco at 11:16 AM on the 30th. Military representatives, Mrs. Muir, assistant to the State Department's chief of protocol, Zhang Suochang, Chinese Consul-General in San Francisco, and Admiral Kirk, former commander of the U.S. Navy in the Western Pacific, were all there to greet her. After getting off the plane, Madame Chiang remained silent to news reporters, refusing to discuss her call for the United States to provide full assistance to the Chinese government. Chinese sources said: Madame Chiang believes that her opinions are best expressed directly to Washington. Madame Chiang was then invited to lunch at the airport's senior officers' quarters, and then she drove into the city. She went to visit her sister, Madame H.H. Kung, Soong Ailing. At 8 PM that night, she transferred to President Truman's former special plane, the "Sacred Cow," and continued her flight to Washington.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st Dispatch] When Madame Chiang arrived in the United States, news came from Shanghai that one of the Madame's purposes was to persuade Marshall to allow a senior American general to voluntarily come to China to command the anti-communist war. The news stated that President Chiang especially hoped that General MacArthur, General Clark, or General Wedemeyer would go to China. It was also reported that Secretary of Defense Forrestal had asked Truman to grant President Chiang's request, but Marshall did not agree.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Dr. H.H. Kung visited President Truman at the White House at 3 PM on the 30th for a meeting lasting approximately half an hour. After leaving the Presidential Office, he met with White House news reporters and said that his visit to the American President was a routine courtesy call. When asked if he had mentioned the issue of immediate aid to China, Kung replied that he had discussed world issues with the President in addition to extending his regards. Members of the press inferred from the duration of Kung's meeting with Truman that there must have been extremely important discussions between the two, but Kung remained silent throughout.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Discussions on Aid to China Plan with Lapham; Hoffman Scheduled to Visit China; First Batch of U.S. Transferred Fighter Planes for Our Air Force Being Crated <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Economic Cooperation Administration, Our City Dispatch] The headquarters of the Economic Cooperation Administration in Washington recently announced that the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, will arrive in Shanghai on December 11th to discuss the US aid to China plan with Lapham, head of the China branch.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Hoffman's visit to China will particularly focus on the problem of food supply to major cities in China. Although the Economic Cooperation Administration has stopped its food supply program to Taiyuan, it still continues to supply wheat and rice to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shantou, Qingdao, and Beiping.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Hoffman's trip to China is likely a prelude to expanding the aid to China plan. The trip is closely related to the fact that Chaer and Lai Jifu, investigators from the Congressional Supervisory Committee on the aid to China plan, returned here from China, and Hoffman followed them on the trip.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Hoffman's announcement to go to the Far East occurred on the eve of Madame Chiang's arrival in the United States to call for more aid to China. Hoffman will return to the United States on December 20th. Hoffman's report will guide the American administrative authorities' response to Madame Chiang. Hoffman's headquarters said that Hoffman will travel to the Far East via the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, he will have a brief meeting with officials from the European Recovery Program. Hoffman is scheduled to take a Pan American Airlines plane to the United Kingdom on December 4th, stay in the United Kingdom for four days, and arrive in Shanghai on December 11th. After that, he will have a series of meetings with Lapham, head of the China branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration. Hoffman will travel with his special assistant, Li Quesi, and will also travel to Korea before returning to San Francisco via Tokyo on December 18th.</p>
<p>At the same time: The US State Department said on the 30th that of the $125,000,000 in military aid to China plan approved by Congress this spring, China has already spent $113,798,326, leaving only $11,201,674.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Grant Fort, Texas, 1st Dispatch] Workers at the Texas Engineering and Manufacturing Factory began crating the first batch of P-51 Mustang fighter planes to be transferred to the Chinese Air Force on the 1st. The company authorities announced that they had signed a contract with China to ship 95 planes to the Chinese government as part of the aid. The planes flew here from Rintroff Airport in San Antonio, Texas. All the planes in the company will be fitted with electrical paint, disassembled and crated. The national emblem of the Chinese government will replace the emblem of the US Air Force. According to company staff: they hope to complete the order within six weeks.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vancouver, 30th Dispatch] The Canada Solar Shipyard had built several troop transport ships for the Nanjing government, which were driven to China for delivery by Canadian sailors. According to their return claims, there were major errors in the construction of these ships. When Transportation Minister Chevrier was asked about this today, he replied that this statement was absolutely incredible because all the ships had been carefully inspected before sailing to China.</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Siege of Xuzhou: The Overt and the Covert Sides <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ding Weidong</p>
<p>The great battle east of Xuzhou effectively came to an end on the 25th of last month. Huang Botao's army corps, having suffered a bitter defense at Nianzhuang, broke through and joined up with Qiu Qingquan's army corps. The main force of Chen Yi's army, having suffered losses, began a strategic retreat. From this, it can be seen that the great enemy that the National Army has to deal with today is truly a formidable opponent. Even as the Ministry of National Defense announced a great victory, Chen Yi's main force quickly moved south, coordinating with Liu Bocheng's army, which was entrenched in Suxian, threatening the gate to the capital—Bengbu. In order to cope with this new situation, the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters also made a major decision, moving the main force of the National Army and the entire Pacification Headquarters to Bengbu, with Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi stationed there to command. Xuzhou was changed to a command post, headed by General Du Yuming. From a military perspective, this was a very brave and timely action. Because when the eastern front was in fierce battle, Liu Bocheng took advantage of the situation to descend on Suxian, and Xuzhou effectively became a besieged city. Even after the victory on the eastern front, communist troops remained within dozens of miles around, and everything depended on air transport for support. Based on the experience of Changchun, it can be known that air transport is an extremely expensive endeavor, and the country's financial resources today cannot bear the long-term burden. The future and safety of Xuzhou depend entirely on whether the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be opened up as a means of cutting off the Communist's supply lines. Another consideration is that the National Army is at a disadvantage in terms of troop strength. What it relies on to win is its strong firepower and good training. In the decisive battle in Bengbu and Suxian, it also needs to concentrate its forces. Therefore, General Liu Zhi received an urgent summons from Nanjing at 2:30 AM one day, and the authorities personally gave him instructions. Starting from the 26th of last month, troops and supplies from Xuzhou were continuously transported south to Bengbu, and the entire situation changed. Xuzhou temporarily lost its importance in strategy. The reporter arrived in Xuzhou on the 25th of last month and left Xuzhou late at night on the 29th to return to Nanjing. Within these few days, I witnessed various changes and deeply felt the impermanence of the fate of war and the calm of the general public in coping with the dangerous situation.</p>
<p>In the Storm</p>
<p>Before the storm arrived, Xuzhou City was indeed in a state of panic for a time. The passenger cars heading south on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway were more crowded than the Beijing-Shanghai Railway during the final period of price controls. Humans have an innate instinct to survive, and those with wealth especially cherish their lives. Among these refugees, most were wealthy merchants and those who were able to move, accounting for about one-seventh of the total number of citizens. About 200,000 people remained, embracing an attitude of leaving everything to fate, and guarding the endangered city. In fact, in the three years of the suppression of the rebellion, the flames of war had approached Xuzhou more than once. The calm attitude in times of danger is partly due to the temperament of the Chinese people and partly because experience has tempered them.</p>
<p>When the tide of war fully attacked Xuzhou, the scene was terrifying. After Jiawang was abandoned, the power supply to Xuzhou City was cut off, and the whole city was plunged into darkness. The climax of the battle was on the 10th and 11th of last month, when Chen Yi's troops approached Xuzhou from the north, southwest, and west. The air force base 20 miles southeast was also shelled. The sound of machine guns could be heard all night, as dense as a sudden rain, and the cannon fire shook so violently that the glass windows of civilian houses were shattered. This was the most tense moment of the Xuzhou defense battle, caused by the unusual movements of some troops, which allowed the Communist troops to approach Xuzhou City. Later, the main force of the National Army moved east, and the battle gradually expanded to the outer periphery. This famous city in East China was unexpectedly spared the baptism of artillery fire. In retrospect, the fact that Xuzhou was able to escape this ordeal was certainly due to the soldiers' dedication, but the internal peace and the people's calm were also important reasons. According to General Tan Fulie, commander of the Xuzhou Garrison: In every major battle, the two things he feared most were a military mutiny and the rear area descending into chaos first, such as shooting and arson at night. The loss of Yanzhou and Jinan, in addition to external reasons, often occurred when internal disturbances broke out at the critical moment, resulting in one person shouting at night, and those in chaos followed. The morale of the troops in the front was flustered, and the defense line collapsed without being attacked. In this decisive battle in Xuzhou, all the soldiers who could fight were transferred to the outer periphery, and the interior was unusually empty, but throughout the entire operation, there were no incidents of night-time shooting or sabotage in the city. The reason for this is entirely due to the strict household registration and Baojia system on weekdays. Every family in Xuzhou had a family photo stored in the garrison headquarters, the police station, and the Baojia chief's office, which were checked at any time to prevent criminals from mixing in. Because there was this organizational foundation, it was able to stabilize the people's hearts in times of danger and help Xuzhou through this ordeal. (The text continues on page 4)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dong Xian Guang, issued the following statement on the 1st: Recently, rumors have been rife about the possibility of the government moving the capital. I hereby solemnly declare on behalf of the government that these rumors are completely unfounded. The government has never discussed the issue of moving the capital. Currently, in the ongoing battles on the front lines, our national troops have selected favorable terrain to lure and annihilate the communist bandits on a large scale. The morale of the troops is extremely high. Our loyal and brave soldiers are writing this glorious page in the war history of our nation. Both Chinese and foreign reporters who have gone to the front lines to observe the war are invigorated by this. I would like to solemnly declare that since the central government has no plans to move the capital, the central government agencies have also made no preparations for relocation. The government needs all civil servants to remain at their posts and maximize their work efficiency to achieve the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. There are absolutely no plans for large-scale layoffs. However, in order to reduce the expenses for food and materials in the capital and to stabilize the morale of government personnel, the government is considering providing assistance to civil servants who wish to send their families back to their hometowns.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Eliminate the Dregs in the Rear! <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and foreign press corps returned from visiting the Xuzhou front lines. Whether in their military reports or in the news photos they took, they all showed the strong morale of the national troops on the front lines, fighting hard to defend the country and the nation, as well as the safety of order in the Xuzhou area, and the cooperation between the military and civilians, which far exceeded the expectations of the people in the rear. This is the fundamental reason for the great victory in the Battle of Xuzhou, and also an important factor that allows us to be optimistic about the future of the military suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<p>However, despite the fact that the soldiers on the front lines are fighting desperately and good news is frequently reported, the people in the rear are restless and anxious, especially the people in the upper class. They have been attacked by the communist bandits and their Fifth Column's propaganda offensive. They believe that they have access to inside information and have superior insights. Holding the mentality that "a dangerous country is not to be inhabited," they have flocked to leave and fly far away. Some are preparing to flee overseas, and some want to take refuge in Hong Kong. They are also vying to spread the news, one telling ten, and ten telling a hundred. The general public is also unsettled by the calls for "evacuation." How can the "higher-class Chinese" (?) in the upper class, who are so flustered and so useless, have the right to demand that the country and society guarantee their remaining assets? We have witnessed this situation of "worried fools disturbing themselves," and then heard the unanimous reports from the Chinese and foreign press corps, and we are truly filled with mixed feelings. The soldiers on the front lines are fighting hard and regarding death as going home, while the people in the rear are fleeing in a panic, scrambling to be the first to escape. This stark contrast is truly laughable!</p>
<p>In reality, these "higher-class Chinese" usually live in luxury and act like they are in charge, as if the whole world belongs to them. Once the country is in danger, they are the first to run away. They neither contribute effort nor money, and they fantasize that other fools will protect their remaining property. They even dream of sending people to contact and collude with the communist bandits, and make provisions for their own safety. How absurd is their delusion!</p>
<p>When Jinan fell and the Northeast's important flags were abandoned one after another, the people in the rear were all heartbroken that some of the defending troops had failed to fulfill their duty to defend the country and had let down the eager expectations of the people in the rear. However, in the Battle of Xuzhou-Bengbu today, when the soldiers are fighting desperately, some people in the upper class are disregarding the nation and the country and are vying to fly far away. How can they face the soldiers who are fighting and bleeding on the front lines! This behavior not only exposes their ugly selfishness, but also disturbs the public and affects the morale on the front lines. Whether in Nanjing or Shanghai, this group of people who only want to escape and make no contribution are all dregs in the rear and moths of the country. We must point out the despicable nature of this selfish behavior, and especially encourage patriotic compatriots in the rear to arouse their conscience and emulate the loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government resolutely engaged in the war to suppress the communist bandits and quell the rebellion, which cannot be equated with ordinary civil wars in other countries or internal turmoil in history. The communist bandits' armed rebellion was indeed intended to seize power by force, but because it has an international background, it is actually part of a world revolution promoted by a certain country. Our people must not regard it as an ordinary political party in a democratic country. Its success is our nation's failure; its victory is our country's demise. At present, the communist bandits' momentum is growing, and the territory they occupy is increasing. Even their troops, running rampant, have penetrated the Honghuai River basin and are poised to attack the heartland of our government. We do not want to be alarmist, and we are absolutely not defeatists, but we must frankly point out that the major battle currently underway between Xuzhou and Bengbu has a major impact on not only the safety of the Jianghuai River basin, but also the future of the entire military suppression of the rebellion. The soldiers and people along the Nanjing-Shanghai line must rise up together, cooperate closely, contribute money if they have money, contribute effort if they have strength, and display the strong spirit of defeating Sun Chuanfang in the Battle of Longtan and resisting the Japanese army for three months in the Battle of Shanghai on August 13th, so that we can turn danger into safety and guarantee the final victory.</p>
<p>Re-examining the crux of past military failures, in a nutshell, it lies in the disconnect between the army and the people, and even mutual recrimination. How to reverse the military decline in the future? The first priority is to restore the spirit of unity between the military and the people during the Anti-Japanese War. This Battle of Xuzhou has restored the confidence of the army, proving that the army is definitely not unwilling to fight hard battles. Therefore, from now on, we should ask more from the people in the rear, and especially take the initiative to eliminate all corrupt dregs, so that the entire society can remain calm and composed, support the soldiers, and fight the bandits to the death. We believe that under the conditions of military-civilian cooperation, not only can the Honghuai River be defended, but the lost territories of Shandong and the Northeast can also be gradually recovered. In short, if we want to reverse the military decline, strengthen the assistance of friendly nations, strive for the final victory, and guarantee the independence and freedom of the nation and the country in the future, the responsibility lies with us, the people in the rear, to establish a firm belief in self-salvation and national salvation!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] After the Nanjing Zijinshan Observatory recently discovered a large comet, it has attracted the attention of people across the country. According to Professor Dai Wensai of the Tsinghua University Astronomy Department, this comet is very large. It can be seen in the morning with a telescope with a diameter of 3 inches. It is not a solid substance, but a group of particles in the outer atmosphere. Therefore, there is absolutely no life on it. This comet has a complete head and tail, but only the head can emit light. It moves along a long elliptical orbit. Its period can be calculated with extremely complex numbers. In Beiping, it is the largest since the end of the Xuan Tong era. Its speed is four times the diameter of the moon per day, and it moves southwest two degrees per day. The brightness is gradually decreasing. Another message: The initial Chinese discoverer of this comet was not the Nanjing Observatory, but Shen Liangzhao, a student at Tsinghua University in Beiping.</p>

<p>Deng Wenyi Publishes Proclamation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, published an article "Learn from the Soldiers at the Front," which is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Xuzhou Campaign, after twenty days of fierce fighting, has reached the end of its first phase. However, the Battle of Suxian, south of Xuzhou, is still ongoing. As the National Army continues to make careful deployments, the battle may be extended to achieve even greater victories. The concern of the national military and civilians for this campaign may even exceed that of the early days of the War of Resistance, because with the fall of the Northeast again, the country has reached the final moment of crisis. If the Communist bandits were to achieve a lucky victory in the Xuzhou Campaign, then Jinghu and even the Yangtze River basin would inevitably be subjected to the disaster of war. I believe that all the people in the country will be aware of this serious fact in their hearts.</p>
<p>The bravery and sacrifice of the National Army soldiers in the Xuzhou Campaign are almost unbelievable to those who have not personally experienced it. I stayed in Xuzhou for half a month and visited the front-line positions several times. Here, I would like to give a faithful and accurate report to the people of the country on what I have seen with my own eyes and what I have heard from wounded soldiers and captured bandit soldiers in a simple and concise manner.</p>
<p>Under the direct instructions of the Communist International and the Communist Central Committee, Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Chen Geng's bandit troops launched this crazy and predatory war, concentrating all the forces of the Communist bandits south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, mobilizing more than 500,000 bandit troops, including 19 columns and 4 independent brigades under Chen Yi's command, totaling about 400,000 people, and 7 columns and 3 military region brigades under Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's command, totaling about 150,000 people. However, the National Army's morale was strong, and officers and soldiers had the conviction to win and the determination to sacrifice. In addition, with the cooperation of the Air Force, the National Army finally displayed a great revolutionary spirit and defeated the main force of the bandits in front of them.</p>
<p>During the campaign, all the officers and soldiers of the National Army were able to sacrifice heroically, advancing wave after wave, surpassing any campaign in the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. The people of Xuzhou and its vicinity, inspired by the heroic National Army, automatically implemented a scorched-earth policy. The common people in the war zone, regardless of gender or age, voluntarily left the battlefield, preferring to live as refugees rather than be coerced by the Communist bandits. The cooperation between the military and the people could not be better. Forty citizens and more than 100,000 refugees in Xuzhou City contributed their greatest strength to support this campaign, because they all understood that this war was a war against aggression and enslavement, and also a war of their life and death.</p>
<p>I have seen and heard that the National Army on the battlefield has created thousands of heroic deeds of sacrificing themselves generously, facing death calmly, and regarding death as going home. The reality of "An inch of territory, an inch of blood" has reappeared in the Xuzhou Campaign. Their sacrifice is tragic and fierce, and its price and consequences are even more glorious and far-reaching.</p>
<p>The Impact and Performance of the Campaign</p>
<p>As for the impact and performance of this campaign, in simple terms, there are the following points:</p>
<p>First, due to this Xuzhou Campaign, the true meaning of the bandit suppression and pacification war has been clearly demonstrated. If the soldiers and civilians at the front did not truly understand that this war was directly related to the survival of the country and the nation, I think perhaps we would not have achieved such great results so quickly. The results of this war, exchanged for such great sacrifices, will surely awaken all the people of China, who will jointly participate in the war of the entire nation against aggression, enslavement, survival, and freedom. At the same time, it will also make the people of the world understand the conspiracy and cruelty of the Communist International and the Chinese Communist bandits. This is already a war of democratic countries, not just a domestic war in China.</p>
<p>Second, the direct result of this campaign is that the blood of 70,000 National Army soldiers has shattered the Communist bandits' conspiracy to capture Xuzhou in one fell swoop and defeated 12 columns and 34 divisions of the Communist bandits (of which the 7th and 10th columns have been completely defeated by us). The remaining dozen or so columns have been severely hit. According to the bandit army's column reorganization, temporary troop replenishment, and battlefield corpses, and the confessions of prisoners, the total number of bandit army casualties is at least 200,000, which is three times the number of National Army casualties and two-fifths of the total force of the Communist bandits attacking Xuzhou. This will give the Communist bandits a serious lesson, so that they know that the spirit of the Chinese nation and the National Army cannot be subdued or defeated by their means of conspiracy, instigation, deception, and incitement.</p>
<p>Third, this campaign has touched the hearts of all Chinese people. We have seen the fervor of celebrations in various places during the campaign, and the unprecedented scale of the consolation movement in various places when the campaign came to an end. In the two cities of Jinghu, materials worth hundreds of millions of Gold Yuan were raised within ten days as in-kind condolences. In particular, the first and second consolation groups organized by representatives from all walks of life in Jinghu quickly arrived at the front line. In addition to cigarettes, sugar, and vegetables, each officer and soldier was given two silver coins of comfort money on the spot, as well as cigarettes, sugar, vegetables, gloves, socks, and towels. All kinds of hospitality, care, condolences, and encouragement were provided to the wounded soldiers. These things were rarely seen during the War of Resistance. This is very satisfactory and gratifying to the soldiers at the front. It is hoped that such a consolation movement will be universally launched and responded to throughout the country, because the time has come for everyone to contribute money and effort.</p>
<p>Fourth, this campaign has stabilized the hearts of the people and the order of the rear in the whole country. The psychological attitude of panic, speculation, opportunism, standing by and watching, and gloating over misfortune of most people has changed. From this, we know that only by standing up straight, standing firm, fighting against the Communist bandits, implementing bankruptcy and protecting property, and desperately protecting life, regardless of age or gender, regardless of north, south, east, or west, can we save the country, resist communism, and save the country. From now on, this is our only way to survive.</p>
<p>Fifth, this campaign will soon let the world know that China's war against aggression today is a continuation of the past War of Resistance, a war to fight for China's independent survival, and also a war for world freedom and peace. The United Nations should make a choice, and the United Kingdom and the United States should take action; on the other hand, it will also let the Communist International Group know that it is not easy to invade China, communize China, and destroy China. The patience of the Chinese people is limited, and the Chinese soldiers still have strength. If the Communist International and the Communist bandits gain an inch, they will definitely encounter strong resistance and be subjected to a blow by our heroic military and civilians.</p>
<p>Sixth, this campaign has established the belief of the Chinese soldiers in victory. Because of this victory and such a major bloodshed sacrifice, we can definitely reverse the war situation and save the situation. The wise leadership of the Supreme Commander President Jiang is worthy of the loyal support of the people of the country. The confidence of the soldiers has been restored from now on. No matter how the Communist bandits slander and vilify our revolutionary soldiers, we have now answered them with facts and actions. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of the soldiers. The National Army can only restore the revolutionary spirit, carry forward the glorious history, and strive for the thorough victory of this war with the attitude of inheriting the past and ushering in the future, learning from the heroic battles of the officers and soldiers of the Xuzhou campaign, advancing on the bloodstains of the martyrs, and becoming successful or benevolent. This is a good example of turning defeat into victory, turning defense into offense, suppressing banditry, saving the country and seeking survival. The Xuzhou Campaign is the best model battle in China's war of independence.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts and influences, we can understand the value of the Xuzhou Campaign. The blood of the soldiers has not been shed in vain. It is hoped that the soldiers of the country will strengthen their study of the lessons of the Xuzhou Campaign and create more brilliant battle achievements. The people of the country should cherish the value of the Xuzhou Campaign, mobilize to participate in the war as soon as possible, and support the bandit suppression war. The soldiers and civilians of the country should learn from the soldiers at the front and work hard to learn from them!</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Soviet Union's Action to Split Berlin: The US, Britain, and France Will Not Sit Idly By; Reply to Neutral Countries' Mediation Plan; Declare All Rights Reserved in Berlin <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 1st dispatch] The three powers of Britain, the United States, and France declared to the Soviet Union and the world on the 1st that due to the Soviet Union's unilateral split of Berlin, the three countries reserve all rights to take any action to continue to stay in Berlin. The words of the three countries are tantamount to admitting that the Berlin issue is unsolvable. On the evening of the 30th, the three countries took advantage of the fact that the term of office of Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia as President of the Security Council had not yet expired and handed him a joint document stating the position of the three countries. This was at the time when Bramuglia advocated setting up a special technical committee to study Berlin's monetary and trade issues. The document of the three Western countries stated, "The three Western countries absolutely do not intend to submit to the Soviet Union's measures to strengthen the blockade of Berlin or interfere in municipal affairs and allow the Soviet Union to be unrestrained. Therefore, the governments of the three countries reiterate the statement of reserved rights when submitting this case to the Security Council as follows: "Will take all necessary steps to maintain the position of the three countries in Berlin under this circumstance." The three countries also pointed out that since October 25th, the Soviet Union has "constantly taken other actions to suppress the municipal government, resulting in the city's increasing division." The Western countries said that they welcome Bramuglia's delegation to "study" Berlin's monetary and trade issues, but also said that they will reserve their position when the study is completed and a resolution is submitted to the Security Council. The three countries said that they intend to "consider the resolution of the delegation based on the committee's report and the general situation at that time." The three countries reiterated their insistence on the Security Council resolution vetoed by the Soviet Union on October 25, but emphasized that any solution should recognize the Soviet Union's unilateral actions to divide Berlin. Due to this document and the verbal exchange with Western representatives, Bramuglia revised his proposal on the evening of the 30th. Bramuglia issued a document stating that the Berlin crisis is only a "simple small contact" in the world struggle and optimistically predicted that it can be resolved. "In order to resolve this matter, actions should not be reckless, and the factors of disagreement should not be overestimated, but everything should be regarded as an accidental event, full of confidence, to understand and sincerely solve this problem.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 1st dispatch] A French official spokesman announced today that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has submitted a reply to Bramuglia, accepting a compromise plan to mediate the Berlin dispute. Mr. Bu plans to start organizing a committee of experts to immediately find a way to draft a solution to the Berlin issue, and then submit a report to the Security Council within thirty days.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st dispatch] MacArthur praised the Japanese Diet on the 1st for passing the bill he authorized to prohibit strikes by public officials, which is "a major victory for those who are committed to the integrity of representative government over the victims who are detached from the government and subdued by a minority." In the document, MacArthur defended his labor policy restrictions, denounced the criticisms of Soviet representatives, British Commonwealth spokesmen, and American labor groups, and declared that his efforts to establish a responsible civil service system were in accordance with the ideals of the late President Roosevelt. In a 600-word document, MacArthur stated that his plan has been misunderstood by people here and abroad as depriving the basic workers' rights in the trade union movement. He pointed out that this restriction does not apply to workers in private enterprises. He said: "The new law is a great victory for the broad and enlightened political style to conquer selfish political conspiracies. Furthermore, this is a decisive step forward for the Japanese people in seeking stable and responsible government." Regarding the limited right to collective bargaining for workers in Japanese state-run industries and companies, MacArthur stated that the freedom granted to government employees in Japan's new political system is more than that enjoyed by Americans. He said: "Due to this new law, public affairs will immediately present a new character and will become a tool for the government to protect public safety and individuals against the pressure of an indulgent minority."</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th dispatch] Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky hinted on the 30th that if the use of the veto power in the Security Council is subject to any restrictions, the Soviet Union will withdraw from the United Nations. Vyshinsky told the UN Political Committee that abolishing the veto power is tantamount to ending the United Nations on a daily basis. He said that the veto power was advocated and established by the late American President Roosevelt, who proposed this idea more than six months before the veto power was included in the UN Charter. He also said, "Without the veto power, the United Nations cannot survive for a day." The committee's representatives explained this point, that is, if the Soviet Union's use of the veto power is subject to any restrictions, the Soviet Union will completely withdraw from the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th dispatch] Vyshinsky spoke at the Political Committee, refuting the British representative's accusations of the Soviet Union's abuse of the veto power, and rejecting the joint proposal of China, France, Britain, and the United States to prohibit the use of the veto power when discussing certain special events.

<p>Yoshida Re-Advocates Arresting Ashida</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st dispatch] In accordance with the Constitution and the resolutions of the previous Diet, the Japanese government ordered the convocation of the fourth ordinary Diet today. However, this ordinary Diet will continue the struggle situation of the previous Diet. The crisis of dissolution has not only not passed, but will definitely be realized. Political observers generally speculate that the Diet will definitely be dissolved after the additional budget案 is passed, at the latest on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st dispatch] In accordance with Article 50 of the Japanese Constitution, members of both houses shall not be arrested during the Diet session, except as provided by law. If an arrest is made before the opening of the session, it shall also be released at the opening of the session. When the previous request to arrest former Prime Minister Shida and other three Diet members, the House of Representatives' Diet Steering Committee based on this article to study whether to allow the arrest, but no result was obtained, the session ended. The new fourth ordinary Diet was convened today, but the formal opening still has to wait until tomorrow. Therefore, Prime Minister Yoshida took advantage of this day's gap to once again request House Speaker Matsuoka to allow the arrest of Ashida and others. In Yoshida's opinion, even if the House of Representatives requests the release after the formal opening tomorrow, the arrest has already been made. Therefore, this kind of request for arrest is purely a political means. How Speaker Matsuoka will respond is currently unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Tea Party Welcomes Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing; New and Old Garrison Commanders Hold Turnover Ceremony; Tang Expresses Four Opinions on the Current Situation <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Mayor Wu held a tea party in the city government conference room yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. to welcome Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, and Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, to their new posts. Over dozens of figures from various sectors attended including Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zha Liangjian, Liu Hongsheng, Mei Lanfang, Yu Shuping, Zhang Xiaosong, Yan Huiqing, Zhao Zengjue, Tian Yong, Shen Zonglian, Shui Xiangyun, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Yu Bingjian, Min Xiangfan, Xiang Changquan, Tao Baichuan, Tao Yishan, Cheng Cangbo, and Feng Youzhen. Mayor Wu first introduced Commander-in-Chief Tang and Commander Chen to the attendees, followed by Commander-in-Chief Tang's address, which included the following four points: (1) Public sentiment in Beijing and Shanghai is currently extremely volatile, and there is widespread pessimism about the war situation. In fact, the Chinese problem is a world problem, and a solution must be sought by analyzing and examining the entire world problem. Therefore, today's crisis is by no means a purely Chinese problem, and its success or failure must be judged in the overall reckoning of the world. (2) It has been three years since the victory of the War of Resistance. While the government certainly has shortcomings in politics, economy, and military affairs, the current difficult situation is due to the damage to vitality caused by the eight-year War of Resistance. Just when the people were yearning for stability after the victory of the War of Resistance, the communist bandits rose up and caused chaos, making it impossible to advance construction work. Therefore, the current shortcomings are purely caused by the environment. If there had been no communist bandits fighting after the victory of the War of Resistance, the situation would definitely not have reached this point. Therefore, to build the country, we must first quell the rebellion. (3) How to unleash strength, concentrate will, and complete the task. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, with abundant human and material resources. If we can pool our wisdom and efforts and fully unleash Shanghai's strength, not only can Shanghai be kept safe and peaceful, but the entire country can also be kept safe and peaceful. (4) I have heard recently that those with financial resources in Shanghai are fleeing in droves, and factories are also moving south. While there are many reasons for this phenomenon, I hope that it can be studied and stopped, because if financial resources and productive enterprises escape, it will definitely not be a blessing for Shanghai, let alone for the country. I hope that the municipal authorities will find ways to stabilize public sentiment and continue production.</p>
<p>Hope Citizens Do Not Believe Rumors</p>
<p>Commander Chen then gave a brief speech, stating: I am a soldier, and I have been appointed to Shanghai to obey the orders of the Central Government. I am not familiar with the situation in Shanghai and have no opinions to contribute to all of you. I only know that the responsibility of the Garrison Headquarters is to maintain law and order and ensure the safety of Shanghai. My colleagues and I must take responsibility and work hard with all our strength. However, psychological construction and spiritual armament are also important. I hope that the people of Shanghai will not listen to rumors and act rashly. In order to ensure law and order, the Garrison Headquarters will not only severely punish bandits but also correct all illegal actions that disrupt law and order. During the August 13th Incident, Shanghai had a glorious history. For example, the Four Lines Warehouse Defense inspired people at the time. I hope we can continue to use this spirit to defend Shanghai. Finally, I am willing to serve Shanghai to the best of my ability under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Tang and with the assistance of all sectors.</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang then reported on his visit to Xuzhou to comfort the troops. Commander Chen reported on the situation after Jinan fell into communist hands. Finally, Cheng Cangbo suggested that the authorities must quickly find ways to stabilize public sentiment in order to save the overall situation. The tea party adjourned at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Military and Civilians Cooperate to Maintain Law and Order</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The newly appointed Garrison Commander Chen Daqing went to the headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to officially take office and held a simple handover ceremony. All levels of directors below Xuan Tiewu attended. After taking office, Chen addressed his subordinates, encouraging them to work with peace of mind and hoping for the assistance of all sectors. Xuan Tiewu then accompanied him on a tour of the headquarters, after which Xuan resigned. Mayor Wu and Committee Chairman Fang all went by car to offer their congratulations. After taking office, Chen met with reporters and said: The current situation is difficult. I hope that the military and civilians will cooperate to maintain law and order together.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Since the start of the Xuzhou campaign, wounded soldiers from the front line have been transported daily by air to the rear for treatment. There are currently nine rear hospitals on the Nanjing-Shanghai line from Zhenjiang to Shanghai receiving wounded soldiers. In this city, the Ministry of National Defense, the Supply Bureau, and the Municipal Committee for the Reception of Soldiers for Suppression and Comfort send staff to the airport to handle reception, tea, and wound care. The wounded soldiers who arrive are sent to the three rear hospitals in this city for treatment. The current capacity of the three hospitals can continue to accommodate about 500 more people, but due to the lack of medical staff, especially too few doctors to treat serious injuries and perform surgery, the relevant municipal health authorities are urgently needed to assist and mobilize surgical team members to participate in order to solve the above difficulties. According to the Supply Bureau, the authorities stipulate that each wounded soldier's monthly non-staple food expense is 300 yuan, which is considered insufficient according to the city's prices, and it has a great impact on the nutrition of the wounded soldiers. In addition, purchasing outside often leads to disputes, affecting discipline and attracting criticism. In order to improve this situation, it is urgently hoped that the municipal government will work with all parties to organize supply stations to plan and purchase on their behalf, so that the wounded soldiers can purchase reasonably priced vegetables at the prescribed cost.</p>

<p>Boarding students at the private Fudan Middle School on Huashan Road and Linsen Road went on a collective hunger strike last night to protest the unreasonable demands of the kitchen contractor. The school's student meals have always been contracted out to outsiders. At the beginning of this semester, each student paid enough food expenses equivalent to two dan of rice at once. Unexpectedly, the kitchen has recently requested a price increase on the pretext of rising prices, which was rejected by the school authorities and students. The kitchen then gradually reduced the amount of food, which the students could still tolerate. Unexpectedly, starting yesterday, the five dishes per meal were suddenly changed to one dish. The students felt that the food expenses had been paid in advance, and the food was so poor that they could not swallow it, so they started a hunger strike last night to show their protest. The school authorities are currently mediating.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Besieged Xuzhou: Two Sides, Light and Dark <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Continued from Page 1</p>
<p>Recovery Status: Starting from the 25th of last month, everything in Xuzhou gradually returned to normal. The sun shone, the cold gradually subsided, and most of the shops opened for business. The vegetable market stalls were crowded with people, and the streets were bustling, which slightly diluted the wartime atmosphere. However, things were very different in the evening. The martial law officer started at 6:00 p.m., and there were no pedestrians on the road. At the same time, since Xuzhou's electricity was supplied by the Jiawang Power Plant, before Jiawang was recovered, Xuzhou was still a dark world at night, except for the Suppression Headquarters' own power generation. The streets were heavily guarded, and everything made people from the rear cities feel that the lifestyle in Jiangnan could not withstand the harsh test of this era.</p>
<p>Because Xuzhou is a besieged city, the supply of materials is difficult, so prices are higher than in the rear. On the eve of the reporter's departure from Xuzhou, the price of white rice was about 500 yuan per dan, flour 200 yuan per bag, vegetables 4 yuan per catty, pork 14 yuan per catty, eggs 3 yuan each, and local Dangshan pears were also sold for 16 yuan per catty. Industrial products, because they come from distant cities, are even more expensive. A pack of Baisi brand cigarettes sells for 20 yuan, matches are 60-70 cents per box, and a second-class bar of soap costs 4 yuan. The Shanghai Comfort Group and the reporter group also contributed a little to suppressing prices in Xuzhou, because they brought a lot of newspapers, confirming that Shanghai and other places were exchanging gold and silver yuan without restrictions. Everyone's confidence in the gold yuan rose sharply, and prices generally fell by 30%. According to the survey, the price of gold and silver in Xuzhou is far higher than in Beijing and Shanghai. For example, on the 20th of last month, the old price of gold in Xuzhou was as high as 6,000 yuan per tael, but the black market price in Shanghai was only 1,800 yuan, a difference of more than three times. The highest price of silver dollars was 60 yuan, and once the news of Shanghai's exchange was confirmed, it once fell to 35 yuan, but within a day or two, it rose back to more than 40 yuan. Chinese people have a commercial mind, and there are special people doing this good business!</p>
<p>As of the end of last month, in addition to the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, which have resumed business, other commercial banks in Xuzhou were still in a state of rest. There are 18 banks in the party, and 6 credit cooperatives. According to people who know the inside story, all commercial banks have backstage support, and they have official funds to lend at high interest rates on the black market. The deposits nominally pay 5% interest, but in fact they have to pay 15%. After the banks take in these funds, they have to lend them to merchants at an interest rate of at least 30%, and merchants have to raise the price of goods by at least 5% per month in order not to lose money. Thus, interest rates and prices chase each other. The impact is that official funds are used to generate interest, and the lives of soldiers are greatly affected. Secondly, the local prices of local products affect the general people's livelihood. If they do not return to regroup, the lives of ordinary people may be more comfortable.</p>
<p>Besieged City Fate: After the victory on the eastern front, the heads of various agencies in Xuzhou held a joint meeting to discuss how to restore the local situation to normal. As a result, several measures were decided, such as asking the airline to resume flights to Xuzhou to stabilize public sentiment; asking local national banks to resume business and allow remittances of less than 1,000 yuan to stabilize the lives of family members of staff working in Xuzhou. At the same time, theaters were ordered to resume business so that the general public could have entertainment in their spare time, and the wartime tension could be unconsciously eliminated, which could also indirectly stabilize public sentiment. These measures were quite effective at the time, but now they have become bygones. Because after the battle shifted to the south, Xuzhou became an isolated city behind the lines, and its future fate is difficult to predict, because the military itself is the most unpredictable. According to an analysis by a senior military officer, to ensure the safety of Xuzhou, it is necessary to advance to Yanzhou in the north and recapture Kaifeng in the west, and the National Army does have this plan. Of course, whether this plan can be realized depends entirely on the Bengbu-Suzhou battle. It is remembered that two years ago, when the overall suppression campaign was launched, the National Army used Xuzhou as its base and concentrated nearly one million troops to go north to Shandong and directly attack Jinan; two years later, Xuzhou has become an isolated city. Reviewing the state affairs of the past two years on the ancient battlefield of Xuzhou makes people feel a lot. However, at the same time, seeing the masses of Xuzhou are able to overcome the difficulties with a smile, as if they have completely forgotten the dangers that have just passed, it is felt that the vitality of the general people of China is particularly strong, and they can cope with any adversity. Although the country is currently in a state of darkness, there is still a way out.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Shu Yunzhang, general manager of the China Textile Construction Company, has repeatedly submitted his resignation to the company's board of directors and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce because the company's business is facing various difficulties that cannot be resolved, in order to avoid delaying state-owned enterprises.

Now that the term has expired, Shu submitted his resignation again a few days ago, and Shu has not gone to the company since yesterday to show his firm determination to leave. In addition, Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing is also staying in Hangzhou and has not returned, and the company seems to be in a state of anarchy, waiting for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to make a final decision.</p>

<p>The ships of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sailing to Hong Kong and Taiwan are unprecedentedly crowded, with each ship exceeding its carrying capacity. Moreover, there are those who board without tickets, and the order is extremely chaotic. In order to maintain order on board, the Bureau has, from today onwards, dispatched additional armed escort teams and reduced the number of passengers as much as possible to avoid exceeding the carrying capacity and causing danger. It is reported that the identities of passengers on various ships have gradually declined in recent days. Most of the prominent officials and wealthy people have already left. Those who are now taking ships to Hong Kong and Taiwan are mostly middle-class people.</p>
<p>Moreover, in recent days, most of the passengers going to Hong Kong and Taiwan have carried a large number of boxes and luggage, so that the decks of the ships are full of luggage, causing congestion on the way. Now, in order to limit the weight of luggage carried by passengers, the shipping companies have stipulated that the total weight shall not exceed 40 cubic feet. This restriction is rarely seen in previous years.</p>

<p>Xie Youmin, standing committee member of the Shanghai County Party Department and chairman of the board of directors of the Zigang Township Cooperative of Shanghai County, and Xie Yaoquan, manager, borrowed 430 catties of bean cakes from the Shanghai Branch of the China Farmers Bank in June of this year, priced at 1.48 million yuan per catty, and distributed them to farmers and members of the cooperative. It was stipulated that the money could only be collected at the end of November, but the two Xies collected the money in advance at a price of 2.5 million yuan per catty. Later, the Agricultural Bank discovered this and reported it to the Shanghai County Government, which sent it to the local procuratorate of this city for investigation on charges of embezzlement. It is now known that the prosecutor has concluded the investigation and trial of the case and believes that the evidence of the two defendants' crimes is indeed conclusive. Therefore, yesterday, they were formally prosecuted on charges of embezzlement.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper dispatch] After the announcement of the lower-period cost of living index for this month, the industrial sector was greatly panicked. Some factories found it very difficult to maintain the status quo at a time when production and sales were sluggish and usury was intensifying. Now that the cost of living index has increased to 15.4 times, and wage expenditures have increased by nearly one time, they really cannot bear the burden. In recent days, they have successively expressed their grievances to the Municipal Industry Association, requesting the government to immediately open up industrial loans to alleviate the urgent needs and enable the circulation of funds. The person in charge of the Municipal Industry Association is now considering making another earnest appeal to the authorities, hoping to provide effective relief in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Subsidized Rice Distribution for Workers, Teachers, and Journalists; Implementation Five Days After Approval at Food Conference <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Food Allocation Committee, in response to requests from all parties, will launch subsidized rice distribution. The target groups for distribution are workers, school faculty and staff (originally only private schools were handled, but this time, city school faculty and staff are also included in the distribution), news reporters and their dependents. The Civil Food Allocation Committee will issue special subsidized distribution certificates separately, which are completely unrelated to the allocation markings attached to national identification cards. The price of the subsidized rice will also be cheaper than the price of rice for registered households. In recent days, the authorities have repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration on handling the subsidized distribution method and technical issues related to the rice shops undertaking the distribution. The matter will be brought up for discussion at the food conference to be held in the municipal government today. If it can be successfully approved, it can be implemented starting from the 5th of this month, simultaneously with the household rice distribution in November. In addition, after the subsidized distribution is implemented, the special rice distribution certificates originally issued to workers, teachers, journalists, etc., will be discontinued.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the special rice distribution will be directly allocated by the Civil Food Allocation Committee. Please ask each beneficiary unit to collect the per capita distribution certificates, together with the rice money, and send them to the office on Lafayette Road to receive the allocation vouchers, which can then be used to collect rice at the designated warehouse. The Civil Food Allocation Committee solemnly stated that all those who enjoy special rice sales must not use the per capita distribution certificates casually. As for the monthly application procedures, they should still be handled before the 15th of each month as originally stipulated.</p>
<p>November Household Rice Price to be Discussed and Decided Today</p>
<p>According to information from the Civil Food Allocation Committee, the selling price of rice for household distribution in this city in November will be discussed at this meeting, as it is necessary to discuss the subsidized rice distribution for industrial and occupational workers, public school personnel, and their dependents, and full preparation is required in advance. Therefore, it has been decided to change the meeting to this afternoon (the 2nd), still at the municipal government, convened by Mayor Wu, who is also the chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, and attended by relevant agencies such as the American Aid Utilization Committee of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Food, the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, the Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, and the Civil Food Allocation Office, to discuss and decide the price, which can be announced in various newspapers on the 3rd. Also, the Civil Food Allocation Committee has fully prepared all the rice for household distribution in November and is only waiting for the allocation price to be approved, which may begin to be sold from the 5th.</p>

<p>According to news from the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office, the auction of commercial enemy and puppet real estate that has been confiscated and finalized has now been announced to be shelved again. The reasons are: (1) Credit is extremely tight recently, and it is not easy to collect funds. Without a lump sum of funds, it is impossible to bid successfully. (2) All parties believe that the re-valuation by the office is too high and they are unable to purchase. Currently, the office has no one to accept the auction of enemy and puppet real estate, so it can only temporarily suspend the process, create registers separately, and submit them to the Executive Yuan for a decision on how to handle them.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Fans Gather Beside Daji Road; After a Long Absence, Donghua Loses to Dongxing by Two Goals; Exhibition Match Results in 3-1 <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper dispatch] The Donghua and Dongxing football teams played a commemorative football exhibition match at the Nanshi Stadium yesterday to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Guoguang Society. Donghua has been out of the spotlight for a long time, and this year is its first formal public appearance. Fans crowded beside Daji Road, filling all four stands with 5,000 spectators, setting an unprecedented record for the Nanshi Stadium. Because Donghua had been away from the field for a long time, its skills were somewhat rusty. Although there were many shooting opportunities, its attack was fierce in the first half, but its luck was not good, and it only scored one goal. Dongxing went all out, with Zhang Jiliang, Jiang Kun, and Chen Qin on the front line, cooperating very well. The defense was strengthened by the famous general Wu Qixiang, making Donghua's left wing lose its activity. The first half ended 1-1. In the second half, Dongxing won two goals in a row, defeating Donghua 3-1, which can be called rare.</p>
<p>The Process Was Quite Exciting</p>
<p>The match was quite exciting, especially the first half, where the strengths were evenly matched, with each side having wonderful goals and scoring one goal each, but the shooting was extremely exciting, and the fans in the four stands cheered incessantly. Dongxing focused on defense rather than offense, so it was able to maintain its defense under Donghua's encircling attack in the first half. Wu Qixiang, Wang Baoshan, and Yan Chengkuan should all be credited. Donghua had been away from the field for a long time and failed to play to its full potential. Chen Mingzhe on the right wing showed considerable progress in his sprints, passes, attacks, and shots. Han Longhai and Li Yao repeatedly attacked, but failed, which was a pity. Zhang Lingen defended the goal and made many saves.</p>
<p>Each Scored Once and No Winner Was Determined</p>
<p>The match started at 3:30 pm, with referee Chen Fubao and linesmen Zang Wenbin and Wang Lin. As soon as the two sides made contact, Donghua's offensive was very strong. After ten minutes, Longhai's angled shot was fierce, and Yan Chengkuan jumped up, but failed to catch it. But heaven blessed Dongxing, and it hit the crossbar and bounced out. Zheng Bingyi hooked it away. After 20 minutes, Dongxing attacked, and Zhang Jiliang broke through in the middle, kicking the door open. Zhang Lingen rushed to rescue it and turned the tide. At this time, Dongxing's offensive surged like a tide. After 23 minutes, Zhang Jiliang suddenly shot from 20 yards from the difficult gate. Zhang Banglun was too late to save it and the ball went through the net. Dongxing won a goal, 1-0. After Donghua's defeat, it was unwilling to give up. Jia Youliang waved his army to attack. Chen Mingzhe went straight down the side. Longhai's header missed. Dongxing's defense blocked it, and it still fell to Longhai's feet, who recognized the door and shot fiercely, sending the ball into the net. Donghua leveled the score within three minutes. After that, both sides still had offensives, but neither made any achievements, and the first half ended with a score of 1-1.</p>
<p>Donghua Drank Hatred on the Field</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides changed positions and fought again. Donghua's lineup remained unchanged. Dongxing changed its troops, Yao Qingsheng was replaced by Xia Shufu, and Wang Burong was replaced by Zhang Jingen. The two teams circled again, and Donghua still took a fierce offensive. After four minutes, Qian Changrong passed beautifully to Li Yao, who cut in and shot, but unexpectedly hit Yan Chengkuan's body. After ten minutes, Qian Yunqing also came to knock on the door, flying into the sky. Jia Youliang's shot also missed. Donghua's repeated attacks were unsuccessful. Dongxing worked hard to attack. After 19 minutes, Wang Burong forced a corner kick, and Jiang Kun rushed and was firmly rejected, entering the net nest together. The ball was also brought in. Dongxing won another goal, 2-1. Donghua's bad luck was not over yet. Three minutes later, Wang Burong rushed in again and crossed. Chen Qin pushed the boat along the water in front of the door, 3-1. After that, Donghua tried its best to counterattack, and the bullets rained down in front of the Dongxing goal, but Yan Chengkuan was as if aided by God, saving each one. In the twilight, Donghua drank hatred and ended the game.</p>
<p>The organizers expressed their deep gratitude to the Nanshi Stadium, the Donghua and Dongxing football teams, and the small football referees for their assistance.</p>

<p>The latest American basketball rules, 1949-50, have two changes, which are translated remotely by the famous basketball referee Liu Hesheng as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When a substitute enters the game, he only needs to report to the recorder. After the referee or inspector directs him to enter the game, he can directly substitute the player, and he does not need to report to the referee or the inspector. (2) When there is a jump ball, it must be held in the nearest circle with a radius of six and a half feet (i.e., the center circle and the two free throw areas).</p>

<p>[Our newspaper dispatch] The St. John's men's and women's teams, which won the university basketball championship, defeated Great China University twice in the third university basketball league yesterday. The score for the women's team was 45 to 15, and for the men's team it was 66 to 32. There were 500 students from both schools at the stadium.</p>
<p>The match was held in the St. John's University Friendship Room. The women's match started at 3:00 pm. St. John's Zhang Luoluo scored first, and Wu Hanlian followed with three consecutive goals. Zhang Luoluo scored two more goals. St. John's defense, Zhou Zhifen, Li Sen, and Zheng Jingyuan were heavily guarded, and Great China University could not break the duck egg. In the first quarter, 14-0, St. John's won by a clean sweep. In the second quarter, St. John's made a big change in personnel. Although the offensive momentum of the forwards was still strong, the defense gradually became lax. Great China's Zhai Wu scored a total of nine points with continuous shots and free throws. St. John's captain Lin Jing scored two shots and two free throws, and Wu Hanyun added three more. In the first half, 28-4, St. John's took the lead. In the third and fourth quarters, St. John's was undiminished, Zhang Luoluo scored five consecutive goals, Lin and Wu also scored. Great China University suffered a setback, allowing Xiao Jixia and Zhang Li to score one goal each, and the game ended 45-15, St. John's won by a clean 30 points.</p>
<p>The men's competition was on stage, with Yu Yi and Wang Weigong officiating. St. John's Sun Moses broke the basket first, and Zhuang Yirong and Wu Xinyun showed their power one after another, and in an instant took a 9-0 lead. Great China's time-out was ineffective. Sun Moses and Huang Tianlie reported that they had hit the target again. Great China University launched a full-scale counterattack, and Yu Zufufu and Yang Hongjun both scored, but the situation was still controlled by St. John's. Great China University only relied on long-range shots to score, and in the first half St. John's had 33 points and Great China University had 14. In the second half, St. John's used as many new generals as possible, and Great China University showed a slight improvement. Sun Hanxi scored six points, and the battle gradually became tense, but not long after, St. John's showed its power again. Wang Gongsen repeatedly received Sun Lixi's wonderful passes and frequently scored. Great China University called a time-out, but St. John's was still unstoppable. Wei Shangpu made three of three shots, Qian Shijun made two wonderful shots, and Hu Siqing tucked in under the basket. The silver whistle blew, and St. John's won a big victory with 66 to 32.</p>

<p>Regarding the deadline for accepting Legal Tender, Customs Gold Units, and Northeast Notes, which was originally scheduled to end on November 20, it has been learned that the Ministry of Finance has approved an extension due to the numerous requests from military and political authorities, people's organizations, banking associations, chambers of commerce, and organizations in various provinces and cities. Anhui, Hubei, Qinghai, Guangdong, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Sichuan will be extended to December 15 of this year. Suiyuan, Rehe, Chahar, Hebei, Shanxi, Guangxi, and Guizhou will be extended to December 22 of this year. Xikang, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xinjiang will be extended to the end of this year.

<h3 id="e97">More Locations Set up for Exchange of Gold and Silver <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The situation for exchanging gold and silver yesterday was still as crowded as before. The Central Bank's decision the day before to add more exchange locations to the branches of the existing undertaking banks was not officially opened yesterday because the various banks were unable to allocate staff in time. It is learned that these newly added exchange locations can be officially opened today, but some branches may only exchange silver coins due to insufficient staff. It is expected that the total number of these newly added exchange locations will be around ten.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Central Bank has stipulated that the amount of gold and silver that its employees can exchange for their deposits is limited to the total amount of their salary, allowances, and bonuses for this month. It is heard that the bank's regulations are mainly to prevent its employees from taking advantage of their positions and exchanging for others out of favoritism, thus losing the principle of fairness and reason.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Credit Still Tight <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, credit in the market has still been trending toward tightness. Yesterday was the first day after the November period. The shortage of cash funds was due to the withdrawal of gold and silver and the large amount of funds carried by some people leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, which increased the demand from all parties. The actual funds were insufficient. The cash premium was as high as 15%. In addition, the interbank credit was also tight the day before, and the amount withdrawn from the Central Bank was not much. Customers were only allowed to withdraw 500 yuan in cash, and all the rest were paid with cashier's checks. The daily rate was also higher than before, between 65 and 80 yuan.</p>

<p>The original ratio for the second distribution of American aid cotton and yarn was set at 583 pounds of cotton per 20-count yarn, but according to the situation in the first half of November, the increase in labor costs was much greater than the increase in yarn prices. Therefore, whether the cotton was spun into yarn or there was excess cotton left after spinning, it was not enough to cover the cost when offsetting labor costs. According to the investigation, the total amount of wages and other temporary increased burdens in the first half of November exceeded the "819" labor cost by 23 times, while cotton only rose by more than ten times. Now, the factories hope that the ratio should be increased in the third phase of distribution to avoid excessive losses for the factories.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend remained sluggish. The capital situation of the industry's banks has not yet eased significantly. Local merchants' buying interest was weak, and retail investors were eager to sell, causing the market to decline further.</p>
<p>No. 4 and 5 refined white sugar opened in the morning at 390 yuan and 385 yuan. With ample supply of inventory in the market and weakening sentiment, prices fell all the way to 365 yuan at the close due to oversupply. Medium and coarse granulated sugar each fell by about 30 yuan, while native brown sugar and other types each fell by 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Rice Market: Weak in the South, Firm in the North; Flour Slightly Rises, Edible Oil Continues to Fall <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was weak in the south and firm in the north. In the southern market, the opening price in the morning briefly saw a bid increase of ten yuan, but due to continued tight credit and abundant arrivals, rice shops' buying interest remained sluggish, and the market trend remained weak, eventually resulting in a decline. Due to its high price, white japonica rice fell back to 360 yuan yesterday, thin indica rice fell by ten yuan, and early rice was reduced by five yuan. In the northern market, prices had fallen too much in the past two days and were lower than in the southern market, so rice shops did not buy, leading to a rebound. White japonica rice was 370 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Thin indica rice rose by 30 yuan, and early rice and "Yangdu Xian" rice all rose by 30 yuan. The total arrivals in the north and south markets yesterday were 8,447 shi.</p>
<p>Flour saw a slight rebound because the previous day's sharp decline was excessive. Purchasers saw the low prices and reduced sales, and actual sales saw buying at the bottom, and the market became active again, leading to a rebound. Old brand flour rose to 118 yuan, and "Warship" brand flour rose to a high of 116 yuan, closing at 110 yuan, an increase of four to six yuan from the previous day. Miscellaneous brand flour all rebounded by five or six yuan, and bran also rebounded, with large bags of bran at 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The decline in miscellaneous grains intensified, as tight credit continued and most merchants did not buy. Soybean prices fell sharply by 25 yuan due to the decline in oil prices. Qingdao merchants did not buy corn, leading to a significant decline. Chongming corn was 140 yuan, a decrease of about 30 yuan. Tea beans and selected green beans each fell by 10 yuan. Red sorghum was selling poorly, falling rapidly by 20 yuan, sesame seeds fell by 30 yuan, and raw peanuts plummeted by 60 to 70 yuan.</p>
<p>The decline in edible oil continued. Credit remained tight, and factories frequently offered sales, but local merchants' buying interest remained low. Soybean oil fell from 630 yuan to 600 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan. Vegetable oil fell below 500 yuan, a decrease of 30 to 40 yuan. Raw oil opened at 720 yuan, and small cart sesame oil fell sharply by 80 yuan. Soybean cake fell by five yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to tighten credit. Merchants rarely made purchases. Bulls continued to sell actively. Trading in warehouse receipts lacked interest. Although there were rumors of increased tariff benefits, sentiment remained sluggish. The market selling pressure was strong. New purchases were cautious. Bears were active, and bulls were unable to push up prices, so they had to lower prices to sell.</p>
<p>42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn initially bid down to 1,700 yuan, lingering at low levels for quite some time. By the afternoon close, short covering caused the bid price to rise slightly to 10,600 yuan, a further decrease of 100 yuan from the previous day. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn also initially bid down to 800 yuan. There were many offers after the opening. At one point, it fell to a low of 6,500 to 6,600 yuan. Due to bargain hunting, retail investors pulled up the price, raising it to 7,500 yuan at the close, a decrease of 300 yuan from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 200 to 300 yuan to 1,100 to 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market saw more offers than bids at the opening in the morning, and bid prices continued to decline. Those with goods were idle and nervous, selling off in succession. It was only heard that northern merchants had some profit taking and short covering. Merchants in Changsha and local merchants also had some buying interest at low prices. Big firms and factories continued to sell, and prices fell all the way down.</p>
<p>12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth initially bid down to 15 yuan. The final bid price was slightly higher, with transactions around 375 yuan.</p>
<p>"Four Gentlemen" broadcloth had the same price, a further decrease of five yuan from the previous day. 190 high-end "Shilin" cloth was transacted at 750 yuan. "White Cat" printed cloth was transacted at 320 yuan. The market for other cloths was also generally sluggish.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Jiangxi People Don Military Uniforms to Support Military Supplies and Civilian Food <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang 28th Quick Report] Although the people of Jiangxi, in this time of widespread conflict, have not directly smelled the gunpowder, they have long put on military uniforms, preparing for the arrival of war. The call by Mr. Xiong Shihui in his hometown to "contribute grain if you have grain, contribute soldiers if you have soldiers" has further deepened Jiangxi's wartime atmosphere today.</p>
<p>"Jiangxi Grain" has now become an important military supply supporting the front lines in suppressing the rebellion. The source areas even have to supply civilian food to neighboring provinces and even North China. The provincial government authorities have made grain requisitioning a major part of Jiangxi's governance today. Not only has the Field Tax Administration Office taken on the entire "requisition and procurement" task, but the heads of other departments and the Provincial Committee are also constantly sitting in outer counties urging the requisition.</p>
<p>However, Jiangxi's burden of supplying grain to the central government this year has increased considerably. Jiangxi's field tax quota this year is 3 dou for actual collection, 2 dou 2.5 sheng for requisition, 1 dou 5 for public grain, 1 sheng for preferential grain, and 9 sheng for autonomous donation grain, each yuan equivalent to 7 dou 7.5 sheng. Except for the requisition, which is entirely for the central government, 50% of the actual collection remains in the county, 30% belongs to the central government, and 30% belongs to the province. The public grain portion is half provincial and half county. Currently, except for counties with inconvenient transportation such as Xiushui Tongpeng in the Mufu Mountain area and Dingnan in the Meiling Mountain area, which are converted to national currency, other counties have already begun the requisition. The total amount of actual collection and requisition in the province, according to the central government's regulations, is: 2.7 million shi for actual collection, 2.03 million yuan for requisition, and 30% of the total amount of requisition and actual collection for public grain, totaling 1.42 million shi. In addition, there are autonomous donation grain, preferential grain, and school grain donations from various counties.</p>
<p>The central government's purchase of military grain in Jiangxi has further increased the burden on the people. Although military grain is purchased at a prepared price, in order to complete the task quickly, the purchasing agencies do not allow buying one or two zu at a time according to the market price. Therefore, the Provincial Military Grain Procurement Office still distributes this year's quota of one million large bags according to</p>
<p>Grain-Producing Counties</p>
<p>to be handled by the county governments. Currently, the central government is urgently urging the Provincial Field Grain Office to purchase and transport military grain. Recently, the Central Grain Conference decided that this year, an additional 400,000 large bags would be added in Jiangxi, totaling 1.4 million large bags of rice, equivalent to 3.733 million shi. Excluding the original quota of one million large bags, equivalent to 2.667 million shi, it has been decided to purchase 400,000 shi of provincial-level public grain and 800,000 shi of county-level public grain, and purchase 1.467 million shi from the market. As for the newly allocated 400,000 large bags, it has also been decided to purchase another 100,000 shi of provincial grain. The Finance Department and the Military Grain Procurement Office will discuss with convenient counties and order the counties to allocate this year's tax grain evenly in six months from November this year to the end of June next year, and purchase 200,000 shi of county grain, also allocated evenly from November this year to June next year. The remaining 766,000 shi will be purchased in the market, and military grain procurement sub-offices will be set up in grain-producing counties to be responsible for handling the purchase.</p>
<p>Currently, the central government has strictly ordered the Provincial Field Grain Office to deliver 70% of the field tax and purchased military grain due this year by the end of November this year, and to fully deliver the full amount by the end of December.</p>
<p>Under the premise of military first during the suppression of the rebellion, the supply of military grain is the duty of every grain-producing citizen in the rear. At the same time, Jiangxi has been designated by the central government as a grain production increase county this year. Central personnel and resources have been concentrated in Jiangxi, designating more than ten counties such as Ji'an, Nanchang, and Linchuan as grain production increase areas. According to a person in charge of agricultural affairs: this year's</p>
<p>Grain Production Increase Work</p>
<p>was delayed due to the late arrival of funds and the slow progress of staff, which delayed the timing. In particular, the funds could not be allocated in one lump sum. After the farmers received them, they could not be used for a specific purpose, and the timing was lost. Therefore, wasteland could not be reclaimed, and land could not be cultivated, only alleviating part of the green seedling money and the exploitation of usury in rural areas.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Jiangxi's grain production received some subsidies from the central government this year, it did not produce real results and suffered from floods in various places, resulting in a sharp decrease in the harvest. If the early rice harvest is counted as 80%, it may still be less than last year's 75.718 million shi. If calculated at 80%, it is only 60.375045 million shi. Based on the province's</p>
<p>People's Consumption</p>
<p>last year's total consumption was 80.1288983 million shi. This year, the following estimates are 66.808649 million shi. (1) Civilian food: Last year, civilian food was calculated based on a population of 12.505808 people, with each person consuming 6 shi of rice per year, requiring approximately 75.134848 million shi. This year's population, according to the Civil Affairs Department's statistics in June 1948, is 12.455013 people. According to the Food Department's regulations, each person consumes 5 shi of rice per year, requiring 62.275 million shi. (2) Seed retention: Last year's seed retention was 306,584 shi. The same this year. (3) Outward military grain transportation: Last year it was 1.710551 million shi, this year's outward military grain transportation (30% of the central government's field tax collection, all requisitioned) is 1.6 million shi. (4) Military grain purchase: Last year's total military grain purchase was 3.167 million shi, this year the provincial government's order to purchase military grain is 2.667 million shi. Therefore, Jiangxi's grain production and sales, after deducting military grain, civilian food, and next year's seed total, are still short of 6.273604 million shi. Fortunately, the autumn harvest this year, such as late rice and miscellaneous grains, has been quite abundant. It is estimated that the total output of the province is 15.785669 million shi. Some of the civilian food in rural Jiangxi needs to be supplemented by miscellaneous grains.</p>

<p>[Our Nanchang 28th Dispatch] In order to resettle refugees from Shanghai and Qingdao, Jiangxi Province's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, based on the county reports, has a total of more than 200,000 mu of wasteland available for use in the province and is drafting a plan to allocate land to 30,000 refugees. The contents of the plan, in addition to giving priority to increasing the resettlement of refugees in the department's original 27 land reclamation farms, also select six counties with more wasteland and larger areas, such as Jinxian, Nanfeng, Guangchang, Jishui, Dexing, Wanan, and Xinyu, to establish eight land reclamation farms. The counties with more scattered wasteland will be handled by the relevant county agencies organizing committees for resettlement of refugee veterans, responsible for resettlement, land allocation, management, and guidance.</p>

<p>Prior to 1945, contact between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Moscow was severely hindered by transportation difficulties. However, the CCP consistently maintained close ties with communist parties around the world. Hundreds of CCP leaders traveled to Moscow, where most received advanced training. At the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International in 1935, three of the forty-seven elected executive committee members were Chinese communists. This committee was of great importance, so Stalin himself, along with Zhdanov, were also executive members. In addition, one of the twenty members of the International Control Commission was a Chinese communist. The presidium of the executive committee, consisting of nineteen members, also included a CCP representative. Stalin himself was also a member of the presidium. The CCP, like any other communist party in the world, was a branch of the global communist movement. This is documented in the history of the CCP and the Communist International, in terms of doctrine, policy, organization, personnel, and action. The latter half of this study will show that this record has not been broken by any changes. The strange thing is not: Are they truly communists? But: Why would well-informed and sincere people raise this question? The Communist Party has never raised this question.</p>
<p>In any country, ideology, prophecies, and commands must suit local conditions. The CCP behaves only as the CCP, not as the French Communist Party. However, what seems complex to some observers, the localized differences do not contradict the overall consistency.</p>
<p>B. China in the Eyes of the Communists</p>
<p>Lenin wrote an interesting short essay in 1913 discussing the importance of China and the possible development of the Asian revolutionary movement following the Soviet revolution, but in the years after the 1917 Soviet revolution, Lenin's comrades had no time to consider the China problem. The Russian Civil War, foreign intervention, and the hope of extending revolutionary power to Europe left them no time for other concerns. But when the situation in the West stabilized, they turned their attention to China. A revolution occurred in China in 1911, but it was clear that this revolution was not complete. Lenin seized the opportunity to transform a middle-class revolution in a backward country into a "proletarian dictatorship" in just one year. This achievement encouraged people to entertain all sorts of empty dreams about the possibility of similar revolutions in other backward countries or colonial regions. China seemed to be one of the Communist Party's initial opportunities.</p>
<p>The importance of China to world communism is not difficult to estimate. First, the Communist Party attached extraordinary importance to China. When world communism encountered an unprecedented internal crisis in 1927—the split between Stalin and Trotsky—China became a major issue. Second, China was the only country with a vast territory and strong communist forces. Therefore, the Communist Party did not need a national government. It only needed its own organized army to maintain long-term control over a vast area. Third, in relatively backward countries, the opportunities for communism are getting better day by day, while in advanced industrial countries, the opportunities are decreasing day by day. China is the only large country that is industrially backward and politically independent. For the Communist Party, it is precisely the experimental factory and proving ground for testing the development of communist theory, strategy, and tactics to all industrially backward countries around the world. These countries happen to account for three-quarters of the world's population. For the sake of thorough understanding, we must make a brief analysis of the characteristics of China.</p>
<p>C. An Analysis of China</p>
<p>China is a large country with great rivers and advanced agriculture, with hundreds of millions of farmers. China has many traditions, carefully preserved by scholars and artists of past generations. It is a country where the old is disintegrating and the new is crystallizing simultaneously. However, the China that concerns us at this moment is a country that is closely linked to the survival of world problems.</p>
<p>First, China is one of the three major centers of human culture and civilization, with a history of three thousand years. The other two centers are India and Europe. Before this century, the changes in Chinese culture were relatively slow. Second, China has a vast territory. China's higher cultural standards supported its strength, enabling it to maintain its vast territory. Even in times of national weakness, it was once conquered by foreign tribes, but it was eventually able to assimilate its conquerors. Third, China did not begin to apply technology and industrial power until the nineteenth century—about four hundred years later than the European Renaissance—with the scale of production and organization. That is to say, Western countries went through centuries to develop a political system adapted to change or progress, but China, in accepting the new industry of the West, had to accept the products that had been developed over centuries, without sufficient time to adapt to the political environment. Europe used sixteenth-century politics to cope with sixteenth-century progress, and eighteenth-century politics to cope with eighteenth-century progress. But China had to use fifteenth-century politics to cope with nineteenth-century progress.</p>
<p>The development of constitutional government, modern legislation, political parties, majority rule, and national unity in the West underwent a three-century evolution before the rise of democratic forces in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In China, these early tasks were not ready, and had to be carried out simultaneously with our later work.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chinese society remains at a stage where the influence of popular thought is stronger than in the West and the organization of government is weaker than in the West. This situation is precisely favorable to communism, whose painstaking and ambitious doctrine is prepared to be sold to anyone seeking new doctrines to replace the old.</p>
<p>The fourth important fact about China is that China has not been submerged by Western civilization. In the past four centuries, only a very few small countries have been able to remain independent politically and legally without European influence. China is the only large country capable of maintaining cultural independence. It cannot be conquered by any foreign tribe, nor can it be divided. No expatriates can establish themselves in China, multiply, and displace the natives, as the British did in the Americas.</p>
<p>In short, China is undergoing a transformation, which would have taken more than five times as long in Europe. A society accustomed to traditional government is now struggling to organize creative institutions. A society ignorant of early science is forced to swallow late science whole. The long-term experimental process that produced modern Western government is too slow to be directly copied or shortened. China must abandon the forces of tradition, even abandon its faith in tradition.</p>
<p>The above is all about China itself. But what applies to China must also apply to the Chinese people. The character of an individual is not entirely similar to the character of his country. People still love peace when their country is at war. Most Chinese farmers are illiterate. He knows that any dynasty must eventually fall. He knows from legends that historical heroes are not all good, nor are they all bad. He opposes anything that is annoying and malicious, and foreigners bear the brunt. Take, for example, the Chinese petty bourgeois, rickshaw puller, shopkeeper, or machine craftsman. He knows dozens or hundreds of characters. He attributes his profession, his status, and his stable life to his family, his guild, or his fellow villagers. He feels the oppression of inflation and price controls, and can cope with it with ease. He has no rational trust in the political future.</p>
<p>He is down-to-earth. National unity is just an abstract concept to him. He feels that China has not yet reached the level of Western countries. He believes that China is not yet suitable for free elections and majority rule. He does not understand that law can be based on legislative decisions. He can be incited by guerrilla riots, and can abandon farming to join the army when necessary. When he discovers that the old beliefs cannot protect him, he will throw himself into new beliefs.</p>
<p>II. The Birth and Growth of Chinese Communism A. The Origin of Chinese Communism</p>
<p>When communism was first introduced to China, China had already overthrown the Manchu Qing Empire (1911). This revolution suffered the same fate as most democratic revolutions. It failed to transform the Chinese people into a modern political society. At that time, China was divided by warlords, and the power of the Beijing government could not reach most areas.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen led the Kuomintang (KMT) to promote the reform movement. The Three Principles of the People were the central idea of ​​his doctrine. He clearly rejected Marxist communism, believing that Marx's "dialectical materialism" was a flawed view of history. Apart from this, the Three Principles of the People were easily misinterpreted by the Communist Party, which claimed to be loyal to this doctrine.</p>
<p>In early 1920, seven people claiming to be communists joined Professor Chen Duxiu to publish a proletarian newspaper in Shanghai and began to organize trade unions. Subsequently, similar organizations were found in Beijing, Hankou, and other cities.</p>
<p>In July 1921, Chinese Marxists held their first congress in Shanghai, formally establishing the Communist Party. This new political party grew quickly. Within a year, it had established its identity and was able to join the Communist International. The Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia immediately sent special agents to China. In September 1923, Moscow sent Borodin to Guangzhou. He told Moscow that the Kuomintang led by Sun Yat-sen was the most promising promoter of the Chinese revolutionary forces. Therefore, Moscow decided to support this political party. The CCP followed this resolution, and under the guidance and assistance of the Communist International, adopted the political line of a united front with the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>B. The First United Front—1924 to 1927</p>
<p>In 1924, the Kuomintang was reorganized and cooperated with the Communist Party, allowing Communist Party members to join the Kuomintang in their individual capacities. Thus, the national united front became a reality under the planning of Borodin and Sun Yat-sen. This was an alliance for the purpose of achieving national unity, a necessary first step to promote the future goals of the two parties.</p>
<p>In his book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," Lenin stipulated that the Communist Party should not be isolated from reform movements. It must participate in these movements, but must not abandon its ultimate goals. Therefore, the style of the Communist Party stipulated by Lenin is between "reformism" and "left-wingism." This is the basis of the Communist Party's united front strategy.</p>
<p>The cooperative partners chosen by the Communist Party are socialist parties in industrial countries and nationalist movements in non-industrial countries. In China, the overriding issues were anti-imperialism and the development of the national government. China became the laboratory for the Communist Party's strategy towards non-industrial countries.</p>
<p>Initially, the CCP and Soviet advisors who cooperated with the Kuomintang were indeed of great value to the National Revolutionary Movement, but after Sun Yat-sen's death on March 12, 1925, the united front began to show cracks. Mr. Sun's "old comrades" were dissatisfied with the expansion of the power of the young generation in the revolutionary movement. In December, they convened the Xishan Conference, demanding the expulsion of Communist Party members from the Kuomintang, the dismissal of Borodin and other Soviet advisors, and the relocation of the Kuomintang Executive Committee headquarters from Guangzhou to Shanghai. The highest authorities of the Kuomintang condemned this independent action of the right wing. Under the urging of Chiang Kai-shek, the authorities took steps to prevent possible strikes by the left wing. At that time, the Kuomintang was planning to launch a large-scale crusade against the northern warlords and could not immediately break with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>The first KMT-CPC united front lasted only three years, from 1924 to the summer of 1927, after which it split again.</p>
<p>C. The Soviet Union and China</p>
<p>In the years after World War I, the Soviet Union wanted to take advantage of the chaos in China to gain benefits, and did its best to show its anti-imperialist theories and practical actions in China. This seemed like a complex policy in a divided China, and sometimes even a contradictory policy.</p>
<p>On January 26, 1923, Joffe, the representative of the Communist International in China, and Sun Yat-sen issued a joint statement in Shanghai, saying that communism or the Soviet system was not suitable for China's national conditions, and that the most urgent problem in China was to seek national unification and independence. Therefore, Joffe guaranteed that China would receive the sympathy of the Soviet people and the support of the Soviet government. In addition, the Soviet Union was willing to abandon the Tsarist era's demands on Manchuria and declared that the Soviet Union had no intention of dividing Outer Mongolia from China. These two interests of the Soviet Union were reaffirmed at the Yalta Conference in 1945 and recognized by the United States.</p>
<p>Sixteen months after the conclusion of this agreement, that is, on May 31, 1924, the Soviet Union and the Beiping government signed a treaty, mutually guaranteeing that there would be no groups opposing the other government within their respective national borders, and that neither government would engage in propaganda against the other's political or social system. This treaty also declared the abandonment of the interests of annexing Mongolia, and guaranteed the return of leased territories. Therefore, the Soviet Union was bound by the treaty and had to maintain a friendly and faithful attitude towards both sides of the Chinese civil war.</p>
<p>In 1927, the Nanjing National Government under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek did not restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Although the Communist Party established a weak and independent government in Central China in 1931 under the command and sponsorship of the Communist International, it did not receive diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union. On the contrary, while the CCP openly condemned Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations with the National Government on December 12, 1932. Moreover, when Chiang led China's war of resistance against Japan, the Soviet Union provided material assistance to the National Government rather than the Communist government.</p>
<p>D. The First Anti-Communist Civil War</p>
<p>After the Kuomintang army began the Northern Expedition in July 1926, it won successive victories. In the spring of 1927, it reached the Yangtze River and successively recovered Nanjing and Shanghai. At that time, the discipline of the national army was very good, but some Communist-dominated divisions violated discipline in Nanjing, carrying out large-scale looting and committing atrocities against foreigners and bourgeois people. This was the first incident since the establishment of the united front, clearly exposing the goals and methods of the Communist Party. The united front was declared dissolved at this time.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou government, dominated by the Communist Party, moved to Wuhan. Chiang Kai-shek, who commanded the troops in the north, set up independent headquarters in Nanchang and Nanjing. In April, Chiang launched a fierce crackdown on the Communist Party in Shanghai and other controlled areas, acting quickly and brutally.</p>
<p>The power of the Wuhan government declined day by day. In July, Communist Party members defected from Wuhan and joined forces with Communist Party members who had fled south from the Yangtze River and the north. They controlled a small area, organized an army, and established a Soviet government, implementing radical policies. The Communist army had only 10,000 men, but by 1930 it had increased to 62,000. In 1931, they convened a Communist Party congress and formulated the Constitution of Soviet China. (To be continued)</p>
