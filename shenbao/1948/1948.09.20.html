<p>〔中央社曼谷十八日電〕我國外長王世杰已於本日午後十二時五十分由香港乘機抵此。渠於一小時後離此飛加爾各答赴巴黎。王外長曾向此間報界發表聲明云：目前亞洲各國必須採取睦鄰政策，以敦睦彼此間之邦交，不干涉與不歧視兩項原則，應為此種睦鄰政策之基本特性，王博士於抵此時，曾告在場歡迎之人士稱：渠本欲在遷逗留較畏之時間，但渠所員之任務，令渠須立即趕達巴黎。惟王氏繼云：渠望將來能償此項宿願。當時在機場迎迓之暹財長披羅桑納方尼克蒙特里曾云：暹政府竟不能獲機款待首次經過暹京之中國外長，實深感失望，　集機場（距曼谷城廿餘公里）之歡迎人士中，有我國駐暹大使謝保樵及其他官員。我國駐暹全部領事各華僑組織代表及各報記者。是時王外長徇各報記者之請發表其呼籲睦鄰政策之聲明稱：在第二次大戰前，亞洲實際處於殖民地或類似殖民地之狀態，亞洲各國及其人民，不僅忍受非亞洲國家之外來干涉與歧視待遇，且亦受帝國主義之日本干涉與歧待，但自日本投降後，亞洲已有十二國（或尚不止此數）或已達成一獨立主權國，或即將完成獨立。似此亞洲獨立國家之數目，即將與歐洲相等，但亞洲人民之數目則猶較歐美兩洲之合併總數為眾。王外畏繼云：「亞洲各國對相互間之邦交，應採取睦鄰政策，而不干涉與不歧視兩大原則，尤應為此種政策之基本特微。不干涉其他國家之內政，乃一時能促進國際間友好與和平之原則。不歧視與予外國僑民以公正平等待遇，將能　　各國人民間之政治團結與經濟合作。舉例言之，如保護外僑，根據最惠國條款享有之權利，保護外僑權利使不比本國人民所享權利有任何差少是」。王博士繼强調稱：「對此種睦鄰政策，如有任何背離，即將損毀相互間之友誼，並令鬥爭與混亂復現於亞洲。中國已採取此項睦鄰政策，並將積極努力，期使上述政策盛行於全亞洲」。王外長嗣轉論中暹邦交稱：關於此余欲强調中國及中國人民過去向卽密切關注暹羅之福利，當一九四五年職爭結束時，中國曾竭盡其力使中国之政策，為各有關盟國所接受。卽視暹羅為一自日本侵略獲得解脫之解放區，視同中菲二國被日本佔領之地區然。上述態度曾獲中國各階層民眾之擁護，中國之採取此秘態度，純係出於對暹羅人民之深切同情與傎摯之友誼，余認余應指出此等友情了解之重要性，王外長末結束其演詞，另向暹境三百萬華僑稱：「余茲籲請吾口國僑胞採取凡足以促進我橋胞與其寄居國人民間之友好關係，及能消除雙方間誤解之一切行動，而不答有損祖國良好信譽之行動。尤盼僑胞了解，僅於諸君僑居之國家能享有和平與繁榮之情形下，君等自身始能欣享和平興繁榮。君等對暹羅發膨所作之供獻，將不致為祖國之政府與人民所忽視，余希望並深信此項供獻，亦將獲致暹政府與人民之認識」。王外長及其隨員三人等一行，於曼谷時間午後二時乘機離此飛赴印度。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>諭當前物價並評幣制改革</h3>
<p>— 羅志如</p>
<p>我們　開政治不論，專就經濟來講，中國當前經濟齣病根，可以說源於三方面嚴重的失衡而來：（一）在人民方面是消費多於生產，（二）在政府方面是支出遠過於收入。（三）在全國對外來說是輸入遠大於輪出。誠然，這三方面的失衡是彼此相關，但有許多國家，只具備一方或兩方面的病態，而沒有其他方面的險象，即此已經構成嚴重的問題，而中國當前的經濟是百病環生，自難怪醫治之不易。</p>
<p>由於上述三方面的失衡，並以物價為關鍵的一環，發生後列若千方面惡性循環的作用：（一）投機與物價的循環，（二）財政開支與物價的循環，（三）薪工與物價的循環，（四）利率與物價的循環，及（五）匯率與物價的循環等。由於這些惡牲循環累積性齣作用，不但使經濟的病態愈來愈沉重，而且加速的惡化下去，月來似已臨崩潰的前夕，非有救急的辦法不可。政府此次不顧一切的來改革幣制，原因恐尚不在其成功的機會已經成熟，而大半是一稱救急的性質。</p>
<p>改革幣制半月來，可算已解決了一個大問題，就是鈔荒。但是政府發言人曾鄭重聲明幣制改革絕非發行大鈔，而有更深遠的意義。是的，從所發命令之多，牽涉範圍之廣，以及半月來的努力，顯然政府是想從物價這一環打破其惡性的轉動，使得整個經濟有一個轉機。目睹情勢迫切，固非有行動不可，但恰於此時接受美援，並亦希望繼續獲得，目亦是將改革提前發動的一個主因。</p>
<p>筆者倒並不主張一定要財政收支平衡，然後改革幣制，其實政府收支如在下半年傎能平衡，且亦不再增發鈔票，亦未見能立卽挽救人心。當前的關鍵，確在人心。十年來漲價巳成根深蒂固的習慣，要說一下不漲，宛如夢境一般。這個習慣如果沒有千鈞之力，一下把它擊破，然後再徐圖穩定其相反的信心，任何救急辦法都很雞生效。</p>
<p>要使當前物價不漲，恐只有兩途可走；一是文的，一是武的。所謂文的，就是讓一般人民能儘量獲得他們相信得過的支付工具，有了這種工具，自然立卽恢復他們的信心，而以這種工具表示的物價目然可以穩定下來，所謂武的辦法，就是限價，以命令禁止漲價，漲價者死，至少也是若干年的徒刑。政府此次所採改革幣制的辦法，顯然是偏於後一種。</p>
<p>在此次改革的前夕，各處都有謠言，傳說已經　好齣「孫幣」卽將出籠，迄到八月廿日晨大家在報上得着消息以後，都驚訝而且失望的說「怎麼還是鈔票」！這種心理再現實沒有了。其實一般人民他們何甞慮到改行硬幣的種稱困難及流弊，可是他們以為政府要他們拿金銀去換紙幣，而却不能以紙幣去換金銀。總覺奇怪。</p>
<p>專家們對於兌現的問題有四種願意：（一）興金銀外幣收歸；一有的原則不相符合；（二）政府此時恐沒有如許多的金偎及外幣以費兌換；（三）金銀在世界市場上的價格隨時變動；（四）金銀可能流入政府不能控制的區域，我們認為這些考慮都有相當的理由，且不必一一去辯解。尤其是第二點乃係一個有無的事實問題，更不必分辯。不過我們試想任你有多少金銀及外匯，如果都拿來作發行準備，對於一般老百姓來說，直等於鏡十裏面的東西，要他們望梅止渴，實屬萬難。如再不信，試想政府此次若果宣布發仃準備不是百分之四十而是百分之百的黃金白銀及外匯，其後果是否會比現在的情形更好些？當戰前鈔票朱發生問題以前，人民只知保有鈔票較現洋更方便，他們又何當願意來兌現，更不注意發行齣現金準備有多少。可是現在鈔票發生問題巳近十年了，不管是否換一稱鈔票，無論限制最高發行額也好，充實準備金也好，加强監督制度也好，老百姓都聽不入耳，這是事實，無庸諱辯。所以我們說如果政府沒有足够的金銀及外匯，那就是改革的機會還沒有成熟。</p>
<p>不過改革後半月來某些地方物價的上漲，劇烈齣彼動，也不一定卽此設明改革完全失敗了。政府發言人也明白告訴大家，物價在短期內是可能要上漲的，不必驚慌。雖然沒有說出理由，我們可以想像得到。在每次發行大鈔之後，物價照例要波動一番，而且在舊幣尚未收回，突然增如許多大單位的新幣，物價目鄭免要受刺激。兼之政府以高價收買金銀外幣，大量鈔票又已出館，然則現今的問題當為經過此一番波動之後物價是否會慢慢穩定下來？我們且不必冬所澦測。經此一番波動之後，人民已經很沉痛的查出，等到三月後，舊鈔完　回，而新　故行限度巳近，政府個就停以齣話，那時恐不是通貨緊縮，而又是鈔荒的現象發生，自然，若於最近將來政府將收歸國有的金銀外匯，或徵得國人在外的財產，或向外偕款的所得，用以作新紗兌現之用，情形當又完全不同了。</p>
<p>前已提到，政府漢前的辦法，仍然是偏重在禁止漲價的這一方面，觀科近來管制機構的立卽成立，經濟檢查的加緊進行，隨時拘捕漲價商人，並科以很重的罰金及徒刑，政府似乎要決心硬到底，但我午深慮一時暴風雨之後，仍要恢復奮態的。我們想到下列幾點，實不能　有此結論：（一）民不畏死，奈何以死懼之？（二）硬性釘住於某天的價格，卽在平時亦難辦一到也不應辦到；（三）此一種貨物，或勞務的價格，常卽為他一種貨物的成本，若要特許按本定價，終將全部調整；（四）限價是要與配給配合進進行的，且不論全面限價，就是幾種主要的貨物的配給，我們事前有無準備？其實政府所公佈的八月十九日的價格，已經較當時實價稍高，而交易時，或又有黑價，或對象已為次等的貨品或竟「暫停營業。」從以上幾點看來，我們懷疑這一次的限價，是否有比二十一年那一次更成功的理由。</p>
<p>無論從政治或經濟方面看，今天還是文的辦法可能有效。其實，在此時來主張鈔票兌現，實有開倒車的嫌疑。但想到改革後馬上對物價要發生效果，暫時權宜之計，恐亦只有這一條路可走。而新幣要能受信，亦非要使改革後物價立即不漲才行。不談改革，還可以拖一下，可是一經以新幣來作試騐，那麼信心就是一切的關鍵，而改革後這短時期內的穩定也就是生死關頭，如以新幣計算也要漲價而且飛漲，將比不改更壤。（自重慶大學發）</p>

<h3>法內閣渡過難關　减政增稅案獲議會批准　共黨與戴高樂派發生流血衝突</h3>

<h3>第三屆聯大會將在揭幕　東西冷戰臨緊要關頭</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>九月二十一日在巴黎夏樂宮揭幕的聯合國大會，將展開一九四八年最重要的外交戰。西方和東方列强的執政當局，都準備在那裏來一次攤　雙方都相信這次大會，將是一個轉捩點，就是：這次大會以後，不是（一）緊張的局勢大見鬆弛，東方和西方之間成立一種可以實行的暫行辦法；便是（二）坦白承認為了決定雙方相持不下的兩大半球的實力起見，軍備競爭是不可避免的。</p>
<p>西方列强有恃無恐，他們覺得對西歐共產黨的勝利，足以加强他們外交爭辦戰的實力。東方列强希望法國共產黨的號召力和勢力始終堅强，能在巴黎策動大規模的市民大會和其他示威行動，造成有利於他們的雾圍。</p>
<p>亞洲</p>
<p>但是瘋狂地準備着的，不僅是就主義上劃分的東方和西方，同時地理上的東方，亞洲的多數國家，特別是印度，都想利用巴黎聯大所供給的傳聲筒來提出幾乎不可挽救的亞洲的經濟厄運，作乞援的呼籲。</p>
<p>「聯合世界」雜誌接到報告：許多亞洲國家的政府預備把各該國嚴重的不安狀態，作明晰的叙述。他們將指出經濟的苦難，天天在驅使人們投奔到共產主義的旗職下去；他們將督促西方列强從速給予切實的援助，以挽此狂閘。</p>
<p>中東</p>
<p>阿拉伯各邦雖因巴勒斯坦問題久懸不決，對於它們今後的步驟還沒有確定，然而它們正在聯合起來攻擊親以色列勢力。它們甚至將以收回油權為要挟，並且很可能暫時放棄聯合國會員資格。</p>
<p>阿拉伯各國覺得巴黎齣政治環境，比較紐約更有利於它們。它們又覺得對於法屬北非洲的泛阿拉伯騷亂，已深深感覺憂慮的法國政府，將以其地主的資格，左右其他五十七國政府，以免開罪於阿拉伯人。</p>
<p>反之，以色列人覺得在歐洲那裏，人們深切知道猶太人在納粹勢力下所受的痛苦，並且了解他們在歷次反抗運動中的不屈不撓的勇氣，那鬥爭該是有利於他們的。在巴黎，他們確信不至於受到紐約猶太人壓迫聯合國的一貫的譴責。</p>
<p>拉丁美洲</p>
<p>中美和南美各國也打算利用聯合國大會，以確立更密切的對歐關係。他們計劃着重新建立被第二次世界大戰所打斷而尚未完全恢復的經濟政治及文化聯緊。若干拉丁美洲國家且準備公然要求解除聯合國對西班牙的禁令</p>
<p>西班牙</p>
<p>弗朗哥政府將派遣若干高級代表至巴黎，相機和聯合國領袖人物晤談。在拉丁美洲代表，特別是阿根廷代表，前往巴黎經過西班牙時，這一個親弗朗哥的攻勢將受到初步的推動。</p>
<p>亡命異國的西班牙共和黨人們，雖然內部意見紛歧，正斯待着法國人民給予有力的公開的支持。他們決不　讓步。他們覺得維持聯合國對弗朗哥的禁令，纔有促成其政體改革的唯一希望。凡準備消滅弗朗哥及其領導下的法西斯黨的任何制憲政府，多數共和黨領袖都預備接受。</p>
<p>義大利</p>
<p>義大利希望巴黎再度以最大的努力，打消那反對它加入聯合國的否決權。該否決權規定，除非羅·保·匈·芬·阿爾巴尼亞同時加入，義大利不得單獨加入歡合國</p>
<p>蘇戰略</p>
<p>局內人預料：在最初六星期中，大會將討論例行事件，至於較大的政治鬥爭，將在美國總統選舉以後方綫討論到。但蘇聯不必等待時機進攻，預料他們一定在美國大選以前就先開大砲，以便利用美國代表團在可能的政府改革前夕的狼狽情形。</p>
<p>否決權</p>
<p>小國以阿根廷，紐西蘭·澳洲，菲律濱為首，正在預備對否決權發動全而的鬥爭，可是它們不一定能說服五强之一，在此時放緊這個聯合國的根本概念</p>
<p>預料聯合國大會中最冷靜最不合作的代表團，將是南非聯邦代表團。南非在著名的愛麗西大飯店裏設有總部，在那裏包下全層房間，以備大隊的南非代表居住，他們決心要遏止「布爾歇維克可笑的干涉南非事件。</p>
<p>大會的地主</p>
<p>巴黎市民正以極大的歡呼，注視這些大規模的準備工作，眼見在大會期間，巴黎又將成為全世界的政治首都，覺得十分與奮。</p>
<p>法政府正以全力把巴黎配備起來，以備搬演偉大的國際戲劇。在法國最著名的建築師兼裝飾家卡洛的指導下，夏樂宮已被改裝成聯大的最美化的背景，同時也具效率最高齣辦公大廈。在掛着花氈的大理石牆辟裏面，設有巨大的窟窿，在那裏裝置電氣馬達和建築　坑，在九月裏將有最新式的電梯上下其問，使法國人不再埋怨他們的大廈雖然好看而缺乏便利的設備。一九三七年世界博皆會中的噴泉，將在此復活，噴射出幾百萬加侖的淸水，在五色的電炬下閃鑠着，同時最高貴的交響樂，將從特別建築的音樂臺上放送出來。</p>
<p>「聯合國世界」估計參加大會的人數，至少有六千人，其中有各國代表。秘書，官員，專家，新聞記者，和各團體機關委派的代表預料成千　萬的市民，將從世界各地前來參觀這有歷史價值的盛會。法國人尤其近水樓台，先睹為快。</p>
<p>看光景參加這次聯大的人數，要比以前任何國際集會為多。因為幣制關係，巴黎吸引觀眾的力量比較紐約更大。多數代表都預備隨帶大批的顧問和專家，並且多有携帶眷屬同來的。多數的歐洲報紙，在成功湖雖然派駐少數記者，但這次都準備派遺大批記者參加大會</p>
<p>旗館房間早已奇貨可居。法政府正設法佈置較寬大的食宿處所，以便利大會的觀眾。一切設備和招待將以配合高級外交人員的胃口和習慣為標準。</p>
<p>無論如何，一般人覺得聯大在巴黎開會，不僅是一種擇地舉行的臨時集會，它實在表現着歐洲的再生和地位的增高。聯大在紐約往往不過是許多大事中的一件，在巴黎它將成為唯一的大事。（譯自「聯合國世界」八月號）</p>

<p>中秋節後，本市發生一嚴重現象，小菜場大都無貨應售，少數菜販携貨出售者，頃刻之間，立被搶購一空。其中尤以肉類為最甚。家庭主婦黎明卽赴菜場，率皆空籃而歸。此種小菜恐慌之嚴重性，為近年來所未有者，眾信此係若干不法之徒，為違抗小菜限價而操縱使然。經濟檢察當局對此已予深切注意，今日將有听行動，對此批不法之徒，決予拘捕嚴懲。</p>
<h3>經檢會報決定　強化檢查工作　嚴防金鈔出境全力撲滅囤積</h3>
<p>經濟管制委員會上海區經濟檢查委員會，昨日舉行第六次經濟檢查會報，計到張師·蔡隆仁·何龍慶·程義寬·俞·繼盧·王昇等十餘人，由蔣經國主持，檢討一週閒工作經過，並決定加强本週經濟管制工作：（一）澈底消波金鈔黑市，因政府對金銀外幣收兌時期，卽將於本月底截止，國行及各委託收兌銀行，連日收兌雖多，但發現有人携離上海，企圖逃避管制，故經管當局決發動全力，於水陸空各方面，强化檢查網，絕對防止私携離滬，並加緊搜捕市內非法金鈔黑市份子。（二）對一般經濟管制之澈查囤貨工作，亦繼續强化，全力撲滅投機囤積份子。</p>
<h3>魚市黃牛活躍如故　漁界人士揭開黑幕</h3>
<p>目新經濟政策頒行後，因當局嚴厲執行「八一九」之價格，致若干物品之供應，轉為黃牛黨所操縱。近來魚業黃牛黨之活躍，情形更形猖獗。昨據漁業界語記者稱：當局雖終日逮捕撲滅魚業黃牛黨，惟渠等活動時因無特別標幟，致檢查人員往往易遭欺矇，渠特評述目前魚業黃牛黨之分布情形，俾便各界明瞭魚業之近況：</p>
<p>（一）楊樹浦江浦路魚市場方面，因最近魚鮮缺貨，採用配貨方式，所有魚販，必需依次排隊購貨，於是不法魚販出動女眷家屬，甚至招收無業游民，滕向魚販會申請會員證，擁入魚阪行列，多領魚貨，增加收入。</p>
<p>（二）十六舖方面，向為魚業黃牛依託之大本營，其取巧方式，現聞亦有兩種：甲，狡猾魚販，以魚市場方面旣需遵照限價，又必排隊購貨，乃利用不肖魚業份子，啄在車站輪埠及郊區進口，（如浦東靑浦來滬之要道）以利誘威脅方式，將魚鮮各貨，直接刦運十六舖抬價出售，假如遇有經濟警察查問，卽詭稱係由市場販來，增加車費利潤，所以售價需要抬高，如此花言巧語，檢查者輒易為其欺滕。乙，另一種狡猬魚販，沿用敵偽時期之跑單帮方式，潛赴附近鄰縣販取魚蝦，上面　以衣被，逃避檢查人員注意，直接以黑市高價售於各大菜館及其他豪客食戶，以圖厚利。</p>
<p>該魚業人士甚望當局對魚業之正當商人，予以保障，使魚業界安定去二</p>
<h3>華貴轎車進口　被人檢舉監署澈查</h3>
<p>蘇浙區監委行署頃又接獲密報。件，檢舉本市某機關高級職員勾　外商汽車公司，私運大批名貴汽車進口。綠自政府規定價值一千二百美金以上之轎車一律禁止輸入後，本市外商汽車公司勾結某機關高級職負，私自運入大量一九四九年出品之最新式華麗轎車，其價值均超過一千二百美金。蘇浙區監委行署據報後，對此頗為重視，現已派員進行調查中。</p>
<h3>台灣淮南兩礦　運煤供應本市</h3>
<p>自北寗鐵路再經奸匪破壞後，開　煤源又告中斷，現燃煤管制當局為維持原定數額之煤源，特由台灣及淮南兩礦加緊運煤來滬。茲悉，淮南煤礦方面，今日可由魯興快輪裝燃煤六千噸抵滬供應，台灣煤礦方面，本週內亦可運到萬餘噸云。</p>
<h3>二期房屋獎券　編製預算計劃續辦</h3>
<p>幣制改革後，各類物價漸趨穩定，擱淺已久之第二期房屋義賣券又將計劃實現，因在幣制改革前，房屋義賣部因購基地及建築材料之困難，故未能順利進行，今值吳市長獎勵空地造屋之際，購買基地及建築材料又均有固定之市價，此後物價在長期管制制度下，當不致再有漲風，發行房屋義賣券解決市民之房荒適當其時，現房屋義賣部已在編製各項預算表中，吳市長對　舉表示願力謀促成。</p>
<h3>廣告業公會　改選理監軍</h3>
<p>本市廣告商業同業公會，昨在浙江中路一五九號二樓召開第三次會負大會，到有社會局代表張漢云，市黨部代表周濂澤，市商會代表俞玉麟等。除由主席團陸守倫·孫追勝·胡譚明分別報告會務及討論提案外，並改選理監事，結果：陸守倫·胡譚明·陸梅僧·吳云夢·倪高風·胡雄飛為留任理事；孫道勝·崔泉聲為留任監事；陸東生·薛石生·鄭孝倫·郁景　·袁錦春，王中林·崔佳良·康際堯·王守仁當選為新理事；沈秋雁。巫卓然當選為新監事。</p>
<h3>銀根續鬆　暗息再降　華南資金倒流　囤積相率出籠</h3>
<p>一週以來，本市銀根更形鬆弛，雖逢中秋節結帳，但市場銀根鬆弛情况，為過去所未有。四行二局上週連續差出共達一千三百另四萬圓之巨，暗息降至七分，行莊均感拆放為難，本週銀根可能續鬆，因（一）華南方面大量資金倒流返滬，（二）物價平定，囤貨相率出籠，游資充斥市上。據某經濟家觀察，銀根鬆弛，暗息降低，對正當產業界頗有良好影響，因暗息低减，成本無形中可减輕，對促進生產，穩定物價，可收間接功效。惟當局對經濟管制，不可放鬆，以免投機份予，套用低利游資，從事囤積物資云</p>
<h3>身份證擬予換發　配米證計劃印入</h3>
<p>市府擬於最近換發國民身份證，並計劃將民食調配會听發之計口配米證，一起印　　　份證上，以節配米證紙張，惟　配粉工作究竟繼續至何期不得而知，故巳向中央請示，俟奉復後，卽開　印　新證，準備換發。據悉：新　換發後，市民購買配米之手續，將重新訂定，須持新發之國民身份證，按照民調會公佈之購買日期，往承配米店購米，米店祗需在其配購證書明某期方格中加蓋「已購」之印截卽可，其手一續頗為簡便。</p>
<h3>年已古稀家興如昔　美老嫗環遊世界十六次　到過四十四國過西太后　近又乘輪抵滬行李僅十二磅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近抵滬之「亞美利加」運輸輪，載來一位年已七十銀髮皚皚之美國奇女子巴立許小姐。她是大下第一號女子旅行家，在過去五十年內，曾環球浪遊世界十六次，且是傎正為旅行而旅行者。遊踪所至，隨身除重僅九磅之行李外，別無長物。巴立許小姐今雖已屆風燭殘年，而猶鼓其壯懷，再作第十七次世界之遊。此次所携行李，重為十二磅。</p>

<p>不化分文漫遊奇境</p>
<p>此次大戰時她得償另一宿願，土阿富汗暢遊一番。以前她曾有一次喬裝香客擬混入阿富汗，但於將成功時被人識破。她之旅行與眾不同者，在於不需大量金錢，相反地，她經常不化一文。巴小姐曾謂「人生必須抓住機會」，她在好久以前，曾抓住機會，未經許可而進入外蒙古。一九四〇年滇緬公路新闢時又曾附搭於軍用卡車土馳行二十日。以此次東來而言，船經橫濱時，她於最後一分鐘內設法上岸，繼又任意陸續搭乘盟軍總部長途汽直十五輛，漫遊東京大坂。巴小姐追述其搭車經過稱：「我跟在美國兵後面上車，他們並未問我是誰，我亦不問他們車子開向何處。」就這樣隨興之所至，巴小姐享受了最有意義的旅行。</p>
<p>舊夢重溫北平最好</p>
<p>巴小姐在滬擬觀光十多天，本月底將重遊北平，一溫四十年前舊夢。她說漫遊四十餘國，比較起來還是北平予她的印象最好。</p>

<p>人像號碼檢查便利</p>
<p>本局現有全市人口卡片設備，查詢市民情况，祗須一分鑛卽可查得，至為便利。此次總複核後，為更求科學化管理起見，採用本局戶口科長吳炎發明之人像號碼分析法，編製人像號碼卡片，嚴密控制暴動，此項工作完成，對於民眾組織，防範盜匪，平允兵役，或遇有拐逃及各種案件之人犯，只須記住面貌，報請警局隨時可按人像號碼，予以捕獲，對於治安及行政上貢獻頗大，現正辦理中，可於本年底完成。</p>
<p>逃避登記將予肅清</p>

<h3>十萬軍聲　海甯潮</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　楊樹生</p>
<p>〔本報海寗十七日快訊〕「海寗潮」為聞名天下古今之奇觀，潮來時，勢如萬馬奔騰，而尤以春秋二季潮汛時，潮勢最為猛烈。海潮之發生，　於日月之吸力，月距地近，而潮性必猛，因正對方向，海水被吸隨起，越水平綫面成江潮，反對方向，地球被掣退縮，離水平綫亦為高潮，又因海水被引他移，水最低落，故每一晝夜，潮來二次，觀潮地點，者以杭縣及海髯為最有名，後因江潮變遷，潮經北大　後，因漲沙過甚，至杭州境內，巳成强弩之末，故杭縣潮已無足觀，惟潮人杭州灣後，因扼於對岸沙磧，激怒不洩折而向北，直撲海寗塘，撼地震天，於是「海髯潮」自南宋以來，卽聞名天下。一臨秋汛，「孤魂潮」，「海王瀏」相繼而屆。農潛八月十八，相傳為「潮生日」，每年觀潮之客，多有不遠千里而來者。海寗城熱鬧情形，不難想像得之。</p>
<p>城廂甦活</p>
<p>抗戰期間，海塘陷於敵手，失於修理，坍損頗巨，潮水因而內灌，因此勝利後城內河道，巳盡淤塞，經浙塘工局及地方政府努力建設，杭海，長寗等公路，巳先後修復通車，髯郭，寗袁，漳江三大塘河，亦巳次第疏竣，然而因為城廂破壞慘　，復員困難，海寗縣政府直到現在，還沒有還治城廂，而在沿滬杭綫的硤石鎮辦公，城廂巳成了一個古城，蕭條不堪，然而每屆中秋，隨着觀潮節的來臨，海寗城廂便甦蘇起來，海塘邊，現在又擠滿了遠近的遊客，各色各類臨時商店，攤販，均亦雲集城廂，作一年一度難逢的買賣。</p>
<p>夜潮奇觀</p>
<p>看一海寗潮」有一方言，卽：「初一，十五潮滿正午，初八，廿三早晚潮，初十，廿五潮平日暮，」故以初一月半為最大，農曆八月十八，潮為盛期，第一次為早上未時，第二次為午後丑時，夜潮較日潮尤為奇觀，在月空橫色，江波靜寂時，俄而風色徒變，東方逐現一綫，月影銀濤，搖光噴雪，浪捲轟雷，奔飛曲折，勢如山岳奔騰，使人毛骨欲暨，隆隆之聲，震耳欲聾，故古人有「十萬軍聲半夜潮」之譽。</p>
<p>潮來美景</p>
<p>潮來時，遠如一綫，若帶若練，堂堂沓沓時聚時散，須臾之間，千變萬化，跳珠湧沫，若素鱗自龍，一前一後，一起一伏。大潮汛時，潮頭高達數丈，捲塘而過，其勢驚人，頭潮過後，餘勢仍濃，波浪急而速，海面頓高數丈，潮頭呈銀白色，洶湧前馳，而其時二潮自南潟北，再度浩蕩奔來，，一瞬之間，與塘岸猛吻，轟然之聲，乃不絕於耳，勢如崩山倒海，俄而潮頭又向西而奔，潮過後，江水混濁，蘆草殘木，隨濤漂流，怒濤時起時伏，水位已高漲，停泊塘岸之海船，乃紛紛啓舵開行，則又為一幅自然美景也。宋陳師道「十八日觀潮」詩有云：「一年壯觀盡今朝，水伯何知故晚潮，海浪背隨山俯仰，風帆長共客飄搖。」對着此情此景，傎是人間樂事了。</p>
<p>然而，海寗本地人是不以「八月十八」潮為奇跡的，除一般無知鄉農，雲集海濱，頸懸黃布袋，手携香燭於潮來時向之跪拜外大部份均係「軋然鬧」而已，故有「八月十五看海潮，八月十八看人潮」之稱。每逢八月十八，熱鬧情形空前，海塘邊幾無立足之地。</p>
<p>鹽民悲運</p>
<p>去年觀潮節，因海寗塘外漲沙達數十里，潮勢被遏，因此並無雄壯鏡頭，惟今年塘外漲沙已全被怒潮冲坍，潮勢又恢復原來雄姿，本月初因颱風襲境，潮水冲上塘岸，寗西袁牧等地鹽田盡被淹浸，此塘及石塘坍損者達數十里，鹽民被怒潮捲去而失踪不知生死者百餘人，鹽民生計斷絕，哀鴻遍野，整日露宿塘邊，嗷嗷待哺，現已組成救濟被災盬民委員會，決定發動縣中，勵志中學，簡師，鹽中等校學生，義賣花朶，擴大募捐，以為遊客造福，故今年海塘邊上，已多了一羣為正義而奔走的學生，不避為被災鹽民呼籲。</p>
<p>搶修坍塘</p>
<p>勝利後，浙塘，局卽擲全力搶修本縣坍塘，並為阻遏潮勢，在牧港，陳汶港，尖山，七里廟等地建築挑水壩，然因潮勢過猛，廈建廈坍，直到現在，巳全部為怒潮所捲去，祝會附近，「高」「冠」「縣」「家」「杜」「　」「鐘」「利」「成」「盟」十字號石塘，全被坍毀，柴塘被冲毀的，亦不勝計算，海塘的安危，影響杭，嘉，湖三郡人民殊巨縣參議會及地方法團現已紛電省方當局，加速澈底搶修。塘工局亦已展開緊急搶修工程，現在，並已計劃將海沙阻遏塘岸，使保護海塘安全，這一計劃，現已獲初步効果，南門外十里外海面，現在又出現了長約五里的沙地，然成功後，對海塘果有極大裨益，然聞名中外之「海寗潮」，又將被湮沒了，惟為保全塘身及人民安全，這是迫不容緩的事。</p>
<p>海寗的名勝古蹟及特產頗多，名勝如硤石雙山，黃灣尖山，在海塘邊的有海神廟，鎮海塔，大觀亭，小普陀，海濱公園，安國寺，安蘭園等，特產如西瓜，水蜜桃，冬菜，白菊花，杜布，甘蔗，絲棉，酥糖等，均為價廉物美土產，值得為遊客們介紹。妬殺傎相業已大白</p>

<h3>中原的苦難</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報鄭州十二日航訊〕記者在上一篇豫北通訊裏已經提到：目前敎人民出血，巳不是痛不痛的問題，而是他們的血有沒有的問題。豫省前任主席劉茂恩氏，於開封收復後，也曾一再和記者談到：要河南出糧，不是河南人肯出不肯出的問題，而是河南根本沒有糧了。所以，儘管省政府派負催征，專員公署派員督征，縣長下鄉坐征……如氾水縣長在今年春間，縣政府派人拿着</p>
<p>鐵鐐下鄕催糧，結果逼死人命十多條，征糧依然不足三成。又如廣武縣因派員催糧，越縣境到榮陽去抓糧戶，結果引起一場不必要的騷動等等。而催征，督征，坐征的結果，根本不能從農村中已經空了齣麥倉裏面憑空長出一粒麥子出來。這次汎區大戰，戰火之熾，為剿匪過程中所僅見：千里平原間，阡陌已失原形。在豫北又有空前的水災。汴鄭的糧荒雖不自今日始，但在今日却顯得更嚴重。河南省田糧處曾電請糧食部按月運糧接濟，不過兩月以來未見下文。</p>
<p>戰亂經年，民困已極，偏偏攤派特多，征役紛繁，這是使專門辦理攤派的鎮保長頭痛的事。鄭州城廂有九個鎮，巳有八個鎮長向縣長提出辭呈。在開封失陷以前的開封報紙上，「坍保」「亡村」等等的字眼兒差不多天天可以看到。</p>
<p>坍保亡村，就是說鄉鎮保長被催糧要糧的人逼得沒有辦法，於是一逃了事免得捱打。在情况最惡劣時，開封城廂內二十多條街上的保甲長全部逃光，要糧的部隊，見到保甲人員就抓，暫時看押，糧齊了，才准許放出。至於在鄉間，催糧逼死人的事兒，似乎並不足希奇。這是一個笑話：鄭州縣參議會馮議長在座談會上合着眼淚說：「老百姓自己有多少糧全都繳給政府，政府還應該再要什麼呢？」記者偶然向另外一個人談起，他說：「我可以代表回答—要命！」</p>
<p>記者到焦作，煤礦產業工會的幾位常務理事耿霞龍，鄭方玉諸君忙趕着來看我，廿分鐘的談話，也是一句話一滴眼淚。</p>
<p>焦作煤礦工人的待遇，講出來要使京滬的工人發笑，五月份以前，他們每人的工資，一個月才一兩百萬，六月份起開始按指數計算，照現在的麥價折合，平均下來每人買不到一石麥子，他們有一天所得買不到半斤麵的燒爐工人，沒有得吃，這工人在燒爐子時暈倒下去。煤礦是孤島，公司沒有錢，六月份工資才發了一半，工人大部份　買東西通日子，回到家中，老婆兒子，牛衣對泣，然而他們還要負擔攤派，六月份，一位姓×的工人接到保辦公處的條子，要攤軍麥三百七十五斤二兩，這就是兩個半月的工資。兵役方面，保甲長可以任意抓人，最近抓去了兩個技術工人。技術工人，依兵役法是可以綏召的，然而這裏是天高皇帝遠，沒有二十多石麥子買兩個人送去是不會換回來的，同時抓去的兩個普通工人，因為再也凑不起二十多石麥子了，只好聽他們擺布。</p>
<p>焦作有繳不出攤糧派款的住戶，保甲長可以拿他們的被頭鍋子，在　十裏三升五升麥的口糧，也可以搜去抵補。記者抵焦作之日，焦作第六保保長張東泉領着部隊到某住戶家要糧，時候已是中午，保長要飯吃，這家住戶炒鶏蛋煮麵條給他們吃，保長却非要上館子不可，結果扭到駐軍某旅旅部去解決。</p>
<p>焦作在搜刮和騷擾的雙重壓迫下，人口是一天天地减少了，接收時有四千二百餘戶，現在只剩下了三分之一，焦作人說，像這樣再下去兩個月，焦作非完不可　動員戡亂，是舉國上下所應當各本崗位竭力支持的，有錢出錢，有力出力，是一個天經地義的原則，而現在的事實表現，多少和理想</p>
<p>鄭縣縣長張克俊和記者談到這些，不免一陣皺眉，他有一段感慨萬端的話：「地方官可傎不能幹，攤派不力吧，對不起國家，然而看看今日的民間，不用說傎個攤派，就運攤派兩個字，也不認說出口了！」</p>
<p>鄭州是中原的堡壘，注重城防工事，無可非議。據城防司令部負責人的報告，從去年九月到今年六月，十個月間，共計征集民伕一千萬人左右（按一人一夭作工計）。這筆賬也可以算算，三百天中出了</p>
<p>一千萬工平均每天要有三萬三四千人為鄉州城防工事而工作，別看鄭州人口多，其中有十多萬人是外面來的難民，鄭州城區本身的人口最多不過二十萬至二十五萬，除去老弱，婦孺，以及有不受攤糧征工的權利的人而外，少壯的人大槪總在十萬人上下，做一個除法，其得數就是在這十個月中每個人三天得去做工一次，這也是馮議長痛切陳辭中的一點：抗戰以來，十一年中鄭州那一天不做工事，然而工事在什麼地方？　記者在開封，就曾聽幾位河南的前輩說：「河南人體力好，良心好，什麼部隊都愛河南兵。」因為這一點，抗戰到現在，河南出了二百多萬兵，二百多萬，照目前的編制，馬馬虎虎可以編成一百個整編師，河南人並</p>
<p>不怕當兵尤其是在今天吃飯都成問題的農村，兵源並不能一定說怎樣枯竭，可是征兵的正題以外的麻煩却多。</p>
<p>因為河南丘好，有空額的部隊，便在鄉間隨便拉壯丁凑數，這種拉法，旣沒有照正式手續辦理，拉的壯丁，自然不能去抵配額，於是上面配下來的兵額，軍師各區還要抽征，征兵，以買得來的壯丁充數，這幾乎巳為各地公開的事實。有了變通的辦法，難免沒有弊端：壯丁送到團或師管區，半路上逃回來再行賣身，此其一；鄉保長藉着征兵，敲詐善良，魚肉鄉民，此其二。</p>
<p>有點兩樣。河南省黨部主任姿員燕化棠說：「現在是有錢不出錢，出力更出錢』。鄭州農會理事長說得更慘痛：「旣敎出力的再出錢，可再別欺負他們了」！看看今日中原的四郊多壘，遙念江南的歌舞昇平，難怪代表河南民眾的革命老前輩劉積學（省議長）大聲疾呼地高呌不平了。谷正綱部長於開封戰役之後飛赴鄭汴慰問，在對河南各界的談話中一再地强調：「功在國家，禍在地方一，這種以一個地區而替國家民族負担着重大的責任的表現，是一種無上的榮耀！然而又有誰知道這種榮耀是無數的血和淚所交織成功的呢？</p>

<h3>登記存外資產　遷港鉅富如坐針氈</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港十五日航訊〕自政府決定登記國人存放國外資產的消息，傳抵本港，港中富戶，尤其是遷港的國內大亨們，，羣起恐慌。據說有兩家在上海設有總行而素負時譽的商業銀行香港分行，連日巳發生「提存」風潮。大亨們聽聞該兩銀行每季俱有報告寄返上海總行，更覺如坐針氈。這裏的外國銀行，早巳存款過多，對大亨們的游資不客氣的拒之門外。他們拿了港幣，祗好轉買美鈔，密藏在自己家裏看看風頭再說。這兩天，美鈔一反過去的淡風，屢屢上場，由每元值港幣四元九角，升至五元二角，就是受了他們的影響。</p>
<p>政府是否傎的獲得港府的諒解在港設立國人資產的登記機關，現仍人言言殊，莫衷一是。據中央銀行駐港辦事處的負責人估計：國人在港外匯資產之多，僅次於紐約。其他如倫敦，加爾各答，三藩市等地，都比不上香港的重要。兩廣外交特派員郭德華，巳奉召入京，商辦登記工作。這一個「謎」，相信日內卽可揭曉。　又據有關方面統計二本港三大銀行發行之通行鈔票，直至今年七月止，共為七億五千二百六十萬元，卽比一九四八年六月三十日發行額增加百分之二·五八，比之去年年底之發行額卽已增加百分之二十。</p>
<p>本港三大銀行鈔票之比例如下：匯豐銀行佔最多為百分之九十二·五二，渣打銀行佔百分之七·〇八，有利銀行最少僅佔百分之〇·四。在戰前，卽一九三八年十二月三十一日，各銀行發行鈔票之比例如下：匯豐銀行佔百分之八十六·八一，渣打銀行佔百分之一〇·九四，有利銀行佔百分之二·二五。</p>
<p>戰前（一九三七年末）各銀行發行鈔票數量比現下僅約三分之一，計：（一）匯豐銀行：一九九·六八九·七九三元。（二）渣打銀行：二五·一七二·六〇四元。（三）有利銀行：五·一七五·五七〇元。</p>

<h3>一般物價　新方案初步成功能　前途尙不無荊棘</h3>
<p>自財政經濟緊急處分令頒布，實施幣制改革以來，截至上週末止，恰為一月。就本市市場而言，物價漸趨平穩，交易亦臻正常，新方案的初步成功，可給予人們的鼓勵和興奮，傎是難以言宣。但是行百里者半九十，我們展望未來的這一段艱苦途程，距離最後成功的目標尚遠，益發需要積極的努力和警惕！</p>
<p>就當前比較顯著齣幾點病態說：（一）上海管制嚴格，外埠管制鬆懈，上海守住限價，外埠仍有漲過限價的現象。（二）游資依舊鬆濫，似乎尚沒有找到一條適當的歸宿之路。（三）商業行莊外匯移存國行一案，尚未能貫澈施行。（四）國營事業股票出售以來，鈉路萎縮，這也是一件值得注意的大事。　登記國人存放國外外匯資產一案，進行似尚不够積極。</p>
<p>物資出境辦法實施較富彈性</p>
<p>上週商品市場的走勢，由於前週的當局禁止携運物資出境，週一週二在限價內頻見低落，但週二以後，物資調節委員會決議，關於禁運出境物資申請許可辦法，決由同業公會負責富核，發給許可證明書，幷由公會將許可出境物資之數量，及簽發證明書之張數，按旬報請督導員辦公處查核。在此准許出口之刺激下，各物又見回升，於是當局對於物資携運出境辦法，復有審緩實施之考慮。同時公會方面，對於携運出境物資之規定，在技術上，亦較富有彈性，如染織·棉布·紗商等業公會，對於紗布出境，擬具實施細則之要點為：（一）為避免紗布出境，刺激本市市價起見，本會得視市價漲跌及各地供求狀况，隨時調劑。換言之，卽發證採取彈性，跌則普發，漲則停發，而售價則絕對不得超越八一九之限價。（二）為防止紗布逃避出境，當地囤積投機及流入匪區起見，應由當地商號出具採辦證，幷由當地所屬之同業公會蓋章證明，方得領取搾運證。（三）領證會員須具備同業工會之保蹬，幷每證限運一次，不得來回往復，視地區之遠近，，以定激回之日期，如有違反功令，應由保證人連帶負責。</p>
<p>限價紛紛核定一般走勢趨穩</p>
<p>紗布方面，細紗如藍鳳尚屬無市，廿一支雙馬由週一之七七七元跌至週二之七五〇元，嗣因受許可出境之刺激，週四又回至七八三元，週末再落至七七〇元。龍頭細布亦由週一之二六元五角，低價步升至週四之二八元四角，週末回至二七元五角。</p>
<p>糧食因產價平穩，供求尚屬正常，價漲落甚徵，南北兩市場上白粳價，週四各微升一角，計為二十元六角與二十元八角。至食米折合金元售價最高統一標準，已奉社會局會同民食調配處及米商業同業公會核定，為特粳每市石二十三元五角，頭號粳二十二元五角，二號粳二十二元，三號粳二十元五角。</p>
<p>食油趨跌，麵粉因限價提高，價略上揚，計限價規定各牌二號一粉廠盤，每包最高不得超過七元一六角二分，零售不得超過七元八一角。</p>
<p>日用品方面，肥皂火柴等會一度下落，週末均見回升。卷烟高檔貨如白錫包三砲台等仍少交易。</p>
<p>食糖因秋飾關係，銷路較暢，價轉挺，如廿四號粗砂週四站廿八一元八角。</p>
<p>週五為中秋節，棉紗，棉布，絲，綢，食米，麵粉，雜糧，食汕等均停市一日。</p>
<p>出售國營事業銷路清淡不暢</p>
<p>國營事業股票出售情形，週一售出各種股票共四八六，〇〇〇元。週二四〇四，四〇〇元。週三二五二，三〇〇元。週四二五一，五〇〇元。週五六〇，〇〇〇元。週末一五，四〇〇元。六日共計售出一，四六九，六〇〇元，合前週總計售出三，五四五，九〇〇元，國營事業股票銷售情形如此淸淡，這是出人意料之外的事情，以此區區之數，在市場游資中所佔的成數，傎是滄海一粟，與預定的出售總額五億六千四百萬元的目標，也相去極遠，個中的原由的是值得當局探索的。此外傳短期國庫券有卽將恢復發售之說，藉以吸納游炎。</p>
<p>總統倡導推行勤儉建國運動</p>
<p>當局對於節約運動，推行不遺餘力，前曾由行政遲政務會議通過，設立節約指導委員會，並擬訂「節約汽汕减少車輛辦法」，本刊巳有報導。　上週總統復以國民一份子的資格，倡導勤儉建國運動，舉出十項公約，以為　行標準。</p>
<p>至於應行實踐的項目，現定為：甲，關於提倡勤勞方面：（一）自力自助。（二）遵守時間。（三）推進國民健康運動。（四）輔導靑年勤學，造成建國幹部。（五）　　難民就業，發展生產工作。（六）推行總體戰，實行總動員。乙，關於厲行節約方面：（一）公物使用及汽油消耗節約。（二）人力使用節約。（三）飲食消費節約。（四）慶弔應酬節約。（五）提倡儲蓄及外幣使用的節約。（六）都市水電節約。（七）摒除不正當娛樂。（八）發展多種生產消費合作事業，期達物資調節與分配合理化的目的。關於取締進口奢侈物品一案，巳由工商部擬訂「取締進口奢侈品銷售辦法」俟提出政院政務會議通過後，卽可付諸實施。</p>
<h3>貨幣金融　時屆秋節銀根仍鬆</h3>
<p>上週週五巧逢舊歷中秋佳節，按例在關節前後，每以舊欠歸結，市間需款冗繁而銀根可轉緊俏，但這改幣以後的第一個佳節，反因市場交易淸稀，需單寥落，頭寸供源旺盛而銀根鬆濫如舊。　按目前週國家行局反進為出以後，上週交換結果，竟又迎綾鉅出，考其原因仍不外：（一）行局大量收購麵粉及結匯證等的結果，致款項續有流出；（二）外埠匯款，連日來解訖頗多；（三）金銀外幣交兌轉多；（四）物資無拋出，游資回籠無由等數項。資金供源雖甚旺盛，而需求者却寥落異常。據估計，本市游資總數，已達二三億元之譜，泛濫之象巳顯。</p>
<p>此次出售國營事業股票，原期可以吸收相當一部份游資，但自十一日至十七日，中紡等五單位股票的出售總額為三百四十六萬八千餘元，僅及本市游資總額的百分之一，若與原定出售國營事業五億餘美元的目標相較，更覺遙不可接。一週來售出的總數旣如是微小，而每天的出售數竟選表現出遞减的趨勢。另據報載，些三百餘萬的股票承購額中，尚包括有一大部份外商的資金，由此不難看出，假如現况無法改善，雖出售國營事業，猶不能為苦悶的游資闢一出路。如何使泛濫的銀根不影響及物價，的確已是目前最值得注意的課題了。</p>
<p>需單稀落</p>
<p>暗息，　着銀根的鬆濫而表現出下降的趨勢。一般說來，暗息火致站七分半至九分之間，其中週一雖因某帮有吸而一度升至一角半以上，週四亦因經管當局公佈禁止出境物資申請携運許可辦法，買方競進而使暗息頃見一角半的高盤，但未幾終以頭寸供源充裕而貶落了。上週貨幣貼息，亦因交易淸淡，需單稀落而僅做二三元之日拆，其間週一週四雖一度升至四五元，但為時甚為短暫。</p>
<p>行局鉅出洋商增進</p>
<p>國家行局庫交換結果，自週一至週五，竟告連續左出，計五天內共差出九百三十九萬九千七百餘金圓，較前週同期內增出達一千零四十餘萬元之鉅，實為市場頭寸的主要供源。</p>
<p>外商銀行目週一至週五，計共差進二百二十三萬六千六百四十五元，較前週同期內增進一百六十五萬七千餘元，據說其中主要一部份，係外商銀行售出結匯證之收入。</p>
<p>商業行莊上週頭寸奇濫，單子獲積，同業拆放毫未做開。據銀行界消息，自改革幣制以後，存款巳陡增五六倍，但放款業務不但無任何增加，反有縮减趨勢。行莊頭寸鬆濫，當以此為主因。上週六十號以前行莊交換結果，自週一至週五，計共差進一百五十五萬八千元，其間雖扣除台灣銀行五夭內二十萬元差進，商業行莊間接交換尚差進一百卅五萬八千元之鉅，較前週同期內增進達七百六十八萬一千元之多，由此不難看出市間銀根鬆濫之一般</p>
<p>華南匯率已告穩定</p>
<p>上週本市內匯牽較前週普見抑低，華南區穗匯廈匯匯水均穩定為二十四元，漢口匯水前週週末為廿五元，週一巳降至十五元，週三起回升一元至十六元，週四週五均無變化。</p>
<p>渝匯匯水前週週末為二十元，上週週一巳降至十元，但週三起開始回升為十六元，週四再升為二十元，恢復至前週末水準，當與資金流動之趨向有關。</p>
<p>津匯匯水前週週末為十元，上週週一二一度落至五一元，週三復回升至十元。</p>
<p>外匯行情，香港金價每華兩週一為二百九十六元五角，週三一度升至二百九十八元，週四同跌至週一之原價。香港美鈔市價以週三為最高，為五元一角九分，週一最低價為五元一角三分，週四稍回，價為五元一角七分。</p>
<p>本市銀樓飾金價格雖照舊，但該業以來源枯竭，兌出量再目一縮錢為五分，業務因此淸稀異常</p>
<h3>進出口貿易的新困難</h3>
<p>雷　風行集中外匯的聲浪下，七八兩季的輸入限額，終於在上週經政務會議通過而發表了，其總數為四千二百一十四萬一千美元，較五六兩委限網减少了四分之一有餘。據輸管會方面表示，此次因有　援物資及僑資輸入，故主要物資之供應，可不因輸入限額的减少而告匱乏。誠然，此次輸入限額的减少，也許會因美援物資的抵達而减輕其影響，不過，目前的進出口貿易，仍陷在不景氣的境况中。</p>
<p>先就進口而論，據說由於成本關係而進入停滯狀態，由國外進口，成本較國內市價要高一成至二成，以鋼鐵來說，竟高達二成以上。過去進口有厚利可圖的貨物，如燒　糖精現在進口都要　本，，因此近來進口商停止向國外訂貨，據進口商方面表示，此種現象能否在短期內有所改善，很難　料。</p>
<p>再就出口貿易而言，據聯合徴信所消息：目前亦困難重重：（一）幣制改革後，產區價格不斷報漲，且發生搶購現象，以致不少出口物資之國內價格，多超過國外價格，如川　國外價格，每担美金三百餘元，國內價格，則為一千三百餘金圓桐油亦與國外相衛平水所產之毛茶每担售價為八十元，但本市平水之毛茶經加工後之箱茶，售價僅為一百元，以產區之價格與本市市價相比，再加運費，相差過多。故出口商遷來均不願向產區購貨，目前所出口者，均係以往各該商人所囤存之貨物，短時期內即可售究。</p>
<p>此次新辦法實施後，國外進口商人事殺價，一般價格均告回跌，有跌至一成以上者，　出已無利可圖。</p>
<p>政府為挽救出口業之危機，已實行限價出口辦法，出口業在國內外矛盾情形之下，又陷於停頓之狀態。</p>
<p>如何使停滯不前的進出口貿易打開僵局，確是目前最重要的經濟課題之一。</p>

<h3>說「動腦筋」</h3>
<p>— 王考</p>
<p>在上海而不懂動腦筋者，其人必爲傻瓜；懂；勤腦筋者，其人必爲渾蛋，甚至是經管會的對象之一。故上海者，實在乃是渾蛋與儍瓜混合而成的社會，儍瓜向來被役於渾蛋；而今而後，希望渾蛋們也嘗嘗某種味通，儍瓜們雖不想翻身奴人役人，至少亦可出一口怨氣耳。</p>
<p>夫腦筋，日日動者也，除非是死了，才不會動。——在南京曾會到一個堪與家，彼有妙論曰，人死腦筋仍會動，蓋所謂無綫電作用也，所以有人夢到死鬼，而有吉兇之兆云。此事有科學根據否，不敢亂說，要亦可作動者恒動一例乎？——但這種動，是軌道內的動，作工吃飯，花錢買物之類，乃是正常的，與其說是人類的理智，卅寗說是本能。</p>
<p>唯上海人之所謂動腦筋，絕不指此（殆不作工而吃飯，不花錢而買東西之類），而且如有人焉，如是解釋動腦筋一詞，未有不爲智者所嗤笑者。天下事眞是難說之至，想不到布普通地點應用的道理與想法，到了通都大邑全部扞格。從前墨子曾說過，「今有人焉，少見黑曰黑，多見黑曰白，則此人必爲不知黑白之辨矣。」看起來遠在三千年前，就有這種顚顚倒倒的事兒，誰謂中國的文化不長乎？</p>
<p>不過世界上的人，固大多數是不開眼界者。卽以黑白而論，蘇東坡的雪詩曾云：「光搖銀海眩生花」，分明是一片白嗎，爲什麼耀眼生花？沒有別的，無非一個眩字作崇，使人昏昏而已。所以「不識廬山眞面目，只緣身在此山中」，也是因爲近在目前的峯嶺不分，就搞不淸什麼眞面目了。我看京戲裏面的淸官册，七品小官去審一品當朝的太師爺，連衙役們都感到離奇，所以潘洪一到御史門前，竟嘆道：「小小御史衙門，倒也有些成風殺氣」！足見其在平時，萬萬感不到有什麽御史衙門存在，而御史老爺們，除了拍太師爺馬屁之外，自亦不敢追視其罪惡，店大欺客，因之造成人們對某一偶像伸大拇指的現象，到了這個分兒，豈唯沒人敢說他罪戾滔天，反而羨慕他的福如東海了。</p>
<p>不敢正視現實，也就是明哲保身，也就是沒有正義感。再一轉，就成爲承認現實，給現實臉上搽粉，甚至於巴結現實，向現實下跪了。變本必要加厲，天下事豈有例外？有人說中國的傳統雖是仁義忠孝，但全是站在利已的立塲上說的，語雖過激，意却不無可取。至少像上海這樣地方，任憑國際飯店樓頂的霓虹標語多亮，也不過一個頂大的諷刺罷了。</p>
<p>說全國的不融力量有百分之七十五在十里洋塲，恐怕也就有百分之七十五的廉恥喪在這個地方。特別是經過十年戰爭以後，人類的心理。道德的標準，是非觀念，幾乎全部翻了·這回改革幣制是表面工作，我們希望隨之而來的必須更有心理復員，心理革命。若是仍然以爲遲早還得是「動腦筋」的天下，我敢保證還是弄不出所以然來。最近這兩天，因爲處處此路不通，常常聽見動腦筋的朋友們搔首怨望，並且更加精密與詭崇的動其腦筋，我的希望是「先生休矣」！彗屋碰到別個星球上，本身是要粉碎的！</p>
<h3>飮水禍多之害</h3>
<p>— 南無</p>
<p>一般人多以爲多飲一點水並沒有什麼了不得的大害處，其實不然。不久以前，美國紐傑賽州有一個十二歲的女孩子，就因爲飲水太多，竟致斃命。這個孩子和她的小朋友遊戲，在二十分鐘連喝了三「夸脫」的水（每夸脫等於四分之一加侖），在十二小時後就死了。因爲她的血管中吸收的水實在太多，竟致肺裏都是水，一切徵象完全和溺死無異。</p>
<h3>簡日蕉</h3>
<p>— 姚鵷雛</p>
<p>望眼明湖秋又春，饑來說食坐逡巡，與游君自宜禪客，不飲我能近酒人；梅柳未應關世事，樓台徵恐損天眞，此行倘復遭風雨，便是潭龍爲洗塵。</p>
<h3>九月七日坐雨至暮</h3>
<p>颱風北來先以雨，灑向閑窗作秋語，淙淙竟日殊未休，一味淸凉逼絺紓。聽雨聽風更感秋，淞江黃浦拍天流，浮家一舸知難得，聊比思光岸上舟·</p>
<h3>會心的微笑</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>讀名家的作品，常常會使我無端的拍擊着書桌，輕撫着那使我忘形的一頁，會心的微笑起來。在這樣的微笑中，會給我一個霎那間的啓示；一種無可言喻的快感。好做就在那個時候，已與作者的心靈完全交感了似的。一旬前，讀羅曼羅蘭的「約翰·克里斯朶夫」，粲然而笑，越發不能自制。他描寫孩提時的約翰·克里斯朶夫，如此的瀾栩如生，心理刻劃的深邃，更足發人</p>
<p>「……他發明把一根破爛的繩子縛在棍上，一本正經的丟在河裏，等魚兒來咬。他明知魚兒不肯咬無鈎也無餌的繩，但他想也許爲了他的緣故而破一次例。他的信心是不會窮盡的。甚至用一條鞭子垂到街上陰溝石板的裂縫中去釣魚，他不時拉起鞭子，非常感動的，自以爲這一次可重了些，要拉起祖父故事中常說的什麽寳物來了……」</p>
<p>讀了上面的一段，我想任何人都將會心的微笑起來。因爲幾乎任何人都這樣的在陰溝石板的裂縫中釣過魚。記得孩提時，每當中秋節的夜晚，我就獨個兒偸覷着團圓的明月，心頭志忑的跳，看是否有祖母所說的龍船的出現。我明知沒有人眞的在月亮中見過龍船，但我想也許爲了我的緣故而破一次例。吾鄉南潯，據說是一個福鎭，因爲歷代以來，兵燹不已，而南潯獨免於難。因此抗戰初起，鄰鎭烽火起處，人們還在想着也許爲了「南潯」的緣故而破一次例。（註：半鎭已成了瓦礫塲。）中古時代的歐洲人常常爲了「一枚針上可以站多少天使」這個問題而爭辯，鬧的面紅耳赤。有的說是三個，有的說是四個，也有說是一打的。且各各似博士論文般的道出滿卷的理由。因爲那時的歐洲人頗多「相信」針頭上的確是站得住安琪兒的。我想我們是生活在「理想」中，就是最聰明的人也得在陰溝石板的裂縫中釣幾會魚吧？</p>
<p>讀戈果里的「死魂靈」，作者描寫瑪尼羅夫夫婦：</p>
<p>「……也不知爲了什麽緣故，他放下烟斗，她也放下手裏的活計，來一個很久很久的身心交融的吻，久到可以吸完一枝小雪茄……」</p>
<p>如此的刻劃瑪尼羅夫夫婦的愛情，不過寥寥數語。但年輕人讀了，已足引起會心的微笑。我想中年人讀了，或許會微美得更有味兒的</p>

<p>新幣制公布以來，舊都各校經濟學者，金融及財政專家，日有長文發表意見，大都條分縷析，應有儘有，是非得失，此處無須置詞。但將一般的生活狀况，薪階之自己打算，就所見聞，略記之。</p>
<p>公敎人員及一般薪資階級，現實的生活，擺在目前，則關心最切，計較求詳，乃人之常情也。起初聽說取消指數辦法，改發新幣劵，不覺同聲大喜。（報上亦說「公務員好了！」）因如百元原薪者，按現在指數，倍數，津貼一併計算，不過一億左右之法幣，而新幣百元則三億矣（因新規定新券一元，法幣三百萬也），驟加三倍，所以初聞而大喜也。</p>
<p>已而見到詳細款目，提及公敎項下，仍有底薪「四十」以下全照新劵發，渦此而至三百，則給十分之二，更逾三百以上，則給十分之一，如是則百元者，可得五十有二，約只原薪二之一矣。二百元者得七十有二，則近乎三之一矣，三百元者得九十有二，則且不够三之一矣。四百元者得一百零二，則四之一矣。五百元者得一百十二，又近乎五之一矣。六百元者得一百二十二，且不及五之一矣！於是笑容頓歛，轉入猶疑，忐忑不定。</p>
<p>一位敎員向稅局人員道喜，說他服務的機關，旣按戰前標準收錢，則他的薪俸，亦必按數實發，倒底還是他們沾光。而那位稅員却說機關說收雖然十足，收錢人員的薪俸，亦許與其他公敎人負一例，打些折扣，故須再聽下文，然後有特別「道喜」之可能。</p>
<h3>斬虎滅蠅錄</h3>
<p>— 宋賢</p>
<p>明李光殿守汴日記，內有數則記奸商囤積之事。崇禎十四年六月五日記云：「瞎虎名遇春，開囤戶，能領御諾經紀。自四月二十八日，閉門至今，銀一兩，買麥四升。遇春暗令騰其價，每兩二斗。董推官親詣南坊擒遇春，斬於市。遇春臨刑云：『有麥八百石，願以贖命。』黃叱曰：『不要汝麥，只要汝命。』遂斬之，於是麥價如故。」</p>
<p>又五代史記張乖崖事曰：「張乖崖爲崇陽令，一吏自庫中出，視其鬢旁下有一錢，詰之，乃庫中錢也。乖崖命杖之，吏勃然曰：「一錢何足道，乃杖我耶！爾能杖我，不能殺我也！』乘崖援筆判曰：「一日一錢，千日一千，繩鋸木斷，水滴石穿。』乃仗劍下階，斬其首。</p>
<p>今有蠅虎，亦入柙籠，斬虎滅蠅，拭目俠之。</p>

<h3>再談蟋蟀</h3>
<p>光陰迅速，白露才過，中秋又逝，正是鬥蟋蟀的季節了。　人類捕蟋蟀而飼養之，驅之奮牙相嚙，自相殘殺，於是引爲笑榮，或作爲賭賽的工具。這在蟋蟀徒有武士般的姿態與精神，其命運眞是大可悲哀。蟋蟀的好鬥，有人說是天生本性，所謂「秉天地肅殺之氣而應劫述」，所以要同類相殘，團牆不已，這說法未免玄之又玄。比較科學的解釋，則是說蟋蟀之所以好鬥，是爲了爭奪異性而起。最初當雌雄蟋蟀相處一洞而有其他雄蟋蟀來侵犯時，洞內雄蟋蟀便不惜一戰，久而久之，成爲習慣，每當兩雄相遇時，就要一較高下。據說蟋蟀在交尾後，特別勇猛，玩家有「未養將軍先蓄雌」之句，若照這種說法，蟋蟀倒像人類一樣，也多的是愛情下的犧牲者。</p>
<p>市塲三處</p>
<p>不管蟋蟀好鬥的眞正原因何在，由於好鬥這一事實的表演，蟋蟀就成了大人孩子們的玩物。上海這一個大都市裏本身並無蟋蟀出產，但每年到了這季節，就有不少的客帮，從杭州紹興江北等地收購了大批的蟋蟀裝運到上海，龍華浦東等郊區，亦有人專門在晚間捉了蟋蟀，淸晨帶到上海來出售。這幾天在西藏路東方飯店附近，連雲路邑廟市塲和南市城隍廟三處的蟋蟀市塲，又出現了一年一度的盛况。除去專賣虫魚花烏的小店是蟋蟀的大本營外，更有無數設備簡陋的小攤販，隨身一隻肥皂箱子，上面放了一二十隻大大小小的瓦罐，旁邊地上堆了一大堆竹管。蟋蟀依其品種的優劣，有的養尊處優的徜徉於瓦罐裏，有的侷促地禁閉在竹管中，再等而下之的是用一隻篾簍，中間放一把枯草，幾百隻蟋蟀同居在這一所敝陋的大房十裏，就祗好向四壁蠕蠕爬動了。</p>
<p>每頭代價</p>
<p>川流不息的買蟋蟀與看蟋蟀的人，造成了這三處市塲空前的熱鬧，每一個攤販前都擁集了黑壓壓的人羣。普通蔑　或竹管中的蟋蟀賣五萬元或十萬元一隻，瓦罐裏的「落盆貨」，則無一定標準。攤主的討價，從金圓劵幾角幾元到十元甚至二三十元，這一方面要看蟋蟀本身戰鬥力的强弱，一方面亦得看買主是否識貨的內行。</p>
<p>八字秘訣</p>
<p>蟋蟀的優劣，在內行人說起來眞是千頭萬緒，可以寫成厚厚的一本書。粗淺地說來：蟋蟀之頭忌淺而扁，臉以方畏爲主，色黑如鍋底者爲佳，牙鉗之開不能過大，只宜一綫，頸項以寬大爲主，腿脛以粗大圓長，小腿以色澤蒼老如斑白·臘黃者爲佳，翅以短薄多縐紋者爲貴，身以肌膚細潔顏色純正背闊肉厚者爲上。色澤以靑爲上，黃次之，赤次之，黑又次之，白爲下品。若紫黃相合極爲難得，故紫黃而帶油滑之色者，爲蟋蟀中稀有的珍品。此外又有所謂「乾，老，細，糯，高，方，潤，厚」的八字訣　，但此種鑑別法在文字上還容易解釋，於應用時若無多年的經驗，所謂「紙上談兵」，依舊是毫無用處的。</p>
<p>盛況難冉</p>
<p>鬥蟋蟀的風氣，據說始於宋明兩朝，先則盛行宮中，漸次流人民間。抗戰以前，上海有公開的蟋蟀賭塲，一輸一贏常有數百元出入。這種玩物喪志的塲所現在是禁止了，雖然私人的鬥蟋蟀會仍常有舉行，但終究盛况難再，今非昔比了。　聞鐘</p>

<h3>The Focus of the Liu Defense Moves Inward: National Army Resolutely Ensures Suburban Positions, Annihilating Over Five Bandit Regiments in Four Days and Nights</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] The Jinan Defense War has entered its fourth day. Although the focus of the fighting is still four or five kilometers southeast of the city, the battlefield has shifted from Maoling Mountain and Yan Chi Mountain to the foothills of Pingding Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, and Guishan, east of Thousand Buddha Mountain, and Majiazhuang, two kilometers from the city. Starting from the evening of the 18th, the bandits switched to the main forces of the 9th and 13th Columns (with the Bohai Column as a reserve). Under the cover of more than 30 mountain and field guns, they again employed their tactic of using human waves to fill the sea of fire. In the fierce fighting until the evening of the 19th, except for Pingding Mountain, which was still firmly defended by the National Army, all other positions were contested repeatedly, no less than a dozen times. The artillery fire blotted out the sky, and corpses littered the fields. The National Army still secured its original positions. At the time of this dispatch, the fierce fighting was still intensifying.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] Around the Jingjiagou (north of Dajiachuang) area, about eleven or twelve kilometers southwest of Jinan City, some units of the bandit's 3rd and 10th Columns infiltrated during the dusk of the 18th. At midnight on the 18th, the bandits once captured Weihuazhuang, more than one kilometer north of Jingjiagou, but were soon repelled by the National Army. Another group of bandits infiltrated the Zhongdianpu and Zhaojiazhuang area, on the north bank of the Xiaoching River, about six or seven kilometers northwest of the city's airport, on the same night. After a fierce blocking attack by a strong National Army unit throughout the night, Zhongdianpu was finally lost and regained before the morning of the 19th. In this battle, Liu Tianxiang, commander of the 86th Regiment of the 29th Division of the 10th Bandit Column, was killed, and over 300 were captured. The rest of the battle results are still being verified.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] The Thousand Buddha, Pingding, Sili, and Baima Mountains, which guard the southern suburbs of Jinan City, are still being firmly defended by the National Army. After the bandit offensive against Kaiyuan Temple at the southeastern foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain was thwarted, Zhu dared to attack again from the evening of the 18th. Jinan City experienced intermittent rain on the 19th. Although the sound of artillery was intense, the residents remained very calm. Many civil groups voluntarily donated carts and organized stretcher teams due to the lack of stretchers and dry rations at the front lines. The Jinan press also organized a battlefield service corps to coordinate with the overall war effort and act as a guide for residents to assist in the war.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] Changqing is still firmly defended by the National Army. More than 2,000 bandits attacked Zhouguanzhuang, east of the ancient city between Changqing and Jinan, on the night of the 18th, but were repelled. At Fenshuling and Shicaiyu (north of Zhonggong), about ten kilometers directly south of Jinan City, some units of the bandit's New 8th Column and the Taian Garrison Brigade also arrived on the night of the 18th and were still fighting as of the morning of the 19th. In addition, Queshan, across the Yellow River from Luokou on the north bank, was also attacked by more than 1,000 bandits from the Bohai Military Region starting from the night of the 18th. As of the evening of the 19th, the fighting was still continuing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] According to military sources, in the four days and nights of the Jinan Defense War, the number of bandits annihilated has reached more than five regiments, nearly 20,000 people. National Army casualties have also reached two regiments. In the past three days, many places in the Jinan city area have been hit by artillery shells. The Provincial No. 5 Temporary Middle School was hit, killing three students.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th Dispatch] The Central Bank dispatched a special plane on the 19th to evacuate personnel from the Jinan branch.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 19th Dispatch] Jinan and Qingdao are as interdependent as lips and teeth. The Qingdao Municipal Mobilization Committee sent a telegram to Commander Wang Yaowu today to express its respect and mobilized all sectors of society to donate goods for air transport to comfort the Jinan soldiers.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Releases Statement While Passing Through Siam: Emphasizing Asian Good Neighbor Policy: Flew from India to France Yesterday, to Hold Lengthy Talks with Nehru in Paris</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 18th Dispatch] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrived here by plane from Hong Kong at 12:50 PM today. He left here one hour later by plane for Calcutta, en route to Paris. Foreign Minister Wang issued a statement to the local press, saying: At present, Asian countries must adopt a good neighbor policy to strengthen friendly relations with each other. The principles of non-interference and non-discrimination should be the basic characteristics of such a good neighbor policy. When Dr. Wang arrived here, he told the welcoming crowd that he had wanted to stay in Siam for a longer period of time, but his assigned tasks required him to immediately reach Paris. However, Mr. Wang continued, he hoped to fulfill this long-cherished wish in the future. At the airport (more than 20 kilometers from Bangkok City), Siam's Finance Minister Phra Boriphan Yukhanukunmontri, who had come to welcome him, said that the Siamese government felt deeply disappointed that it could not have the opportunity to entertain the Chinese Foreign Minister who was passing through the Siamese capital for the first time. Among the welcoming crowd at the airport were our Ambassador to Siam Xie Baoqiao and other officials, all the consuls stationed in Siam, representatives of various overseas Chinese organizations, and newspaper reporters. At that time, Foreign Minister Wang, at the request of newspaper reporters, issued his statement calling for a good neighbor policy, saying: Before World War II, Asia was actually in a state of colonialism or a similar state. Asian countries and their people not only suffered from foreign interference and discriminatory treatment from non-Asian countries, but also from the interference and discriminatory treatment of imperialist Japan. But since Japan's surrender, Asia has had twelve countries (or perhaps even more than that) that have either achieved independent sovereignty or are about to achieve independence. The number of independent Asian countries will soon be equal to that of Europe, but the number of Asian people is still greater than the combined total of Europe and the Americas. Foreign Minister Wang continued: "Asian countries should adopt a good neighbor policy towards each other's national relations, and the two major principles of non-interference and non-discrimination should be the basic characteristics of this policy. Non-interference in other countries' internal affairs is a principle that can promote international friendship and peace. Non-discrimination and fair and equal treatment of foreign nationals will strengthen political unity and economic cooperation among the peoples of all countries. For example, the protection of the rights of foreign nationals based on the most-favored-nation clause, protecting the rights of foreign nationals so that they are not any less than the rights enjoyed by the people of the country." Dr. Wang went on to emphasize: "Any deviation from this good neighbor policy will damage mutual friendship and allow strife and chaos to reappear in Asia. China has adopted this good neighbor policy and will actively strive to make the above policy prevail throughout Asia." Foreign Minister Wang then turned to discuss Sino-Siamese relations, saying: "Regarding this, I want to emphasize that China and the Chinese people have always closely关注关注 Siam's welfare. When the war ended in 1945, China did its best to have its policy accepted by all the Allied countries. That is, Siam was regarded as a liberated area freed from Japanese aggression, similar to the areas occupied by Japan such as China and the Philippines. The above attitude was supported by all levels of Chinese society. China's adoption of this attitude was purely out of deep sympathy and sincere friendship for the people of Siam. I think I should point out the importance of such friendship and understanding." Foreign Minister Wang concluded his speech by saying to the three million overseas Chinese in Siam: "I now call on our overseas Chinese compatriots to take all actions that can promote friendly relations between our compatriots and the people of their host country, and can eliminate misunderstandings between the two sides, and not to take any actions that damage the good reputation of the motherland. In particular, I hope that the overseas Chinese will understand that only when the countries where you reside can enjoy peace and prosperity can you yourselves enjoy peace and prosperity. The contributions that you make to Siam's development will not be ignored by the government and people of the motherland. I hope and firmly believe that this contribution will also be recognized by the Siamese government and people." Foreign Minister Wang and his party of three people left here by plane for India at 2:00 PM Bangkok time.</p>

<h3>Resources Committee Works Hard to Expand Coal Mines in Central and Southern China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Resources Committee believes that the coal shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai is serious, and the industries along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Hankou lines are gradually rising. In order to cope with this serious coal consumption situation, it has recently made its best efforts to expand the eight coal mines in the central and southern China regions of western Jiangxi, Zhejiang, central Hunan, Hunan-Xiang, Xiang-Yong, Yong-Shao, southern Hubei, and Nanling. However, the above-mentioned eight mines lack important equipment, which is equivalent to developing new mines, and everything must be done from scratch. In order to supplement the shortage of technical employees, employees withdrawn from the various mines in the Northeast have been arranged as much as possible. Among them, the current daily output is still in the construction period, totaling no more than 1,000 tons. It is expected to increase to 1,500 to 2,000 tons by the end of this year, and to increase to 5,000 to 6,000 tons per day by the end of next year.

<h3>Discussing Current Prices and Evaluating Currency System Reform</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhiru</p>
<p>Leaving aside politics, from an economic perspective, the root cause of China's current economic problems can be said to stem from three serious imbalances: (1) In terms of the people, consumption exceeds production; (2) In terms of the government, expenditure far exceeds revenue; (3) In terms of the nation as a whole, imports are far greater than exports. Of course, these three imbalances are interconnected, but many countries only exhibit one or two of these pathological conditions, without the other risks. This alone already constitutes a serious problem. China's current economy is beset by all sorts of ailments, so it is no wonder that it is difficult to cure.</p>
<p>Due to the above three imbalances, with prices being a key link, the following vicious cycles have emerged: (1) Speculation and price cycles; (2) Fiscal expenditure and price cycles; (3) Wage and price cycles; (4) Interest rate and price cycles; and (5) Exchange rate and price cycles. Due to the cumulative effect of these vicious cycles, not only has the economic pathology become increasingly serious, but it has also accelerated the deterioration. In recent months, it seems to have reached the eve of collapse, and emergency measures are necessary. The government's current all-out reform of the currency system is probably not because the opportunity for success has matured, but largely because of its emergency nature.</p>
<p>In the half-month since the currency reform, it can be said that a major problem, the banknote shortage, has been resolved. However, government spokespersons have solemnly stated that currency reform is by no means simply issuing large banknotes, but has far-reaching significance. Indeed, judging from the number of orders issued, the breadth of the scope involved, and the efforts made in the past half-month, it is clear that the government intends to break the vicious cycle from the price link, so that the entire economy has a turnaround. Seeing the urgency of the situation, action is necessary, but accepting US aid at this time, and hoping to continue to receive it, is also a major reason for initiating the reform ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>The author does not advocate that fiscal revenue and expenditure must be balanced before reforming the currency system. In fact, even if government revenue and expenditure can be balanced in the second half of the year, and no more banknotes are issued, it is not necessarily possible to immediately restore people's confidence. The current key lies in people's confidence. For ten years, rising prices have become a deeply ingrained habit. To say that prices will not rise at all is like a dream. If this habit is not shattered at once with overwhelming force, and then slowly stabilize the opposite confidence, any emergency measures will be ineffective.</p>
<p>To prevent current prices from rising, there are probably only two ways to go: one is "civilian," and the other is "military." The so-called "civilian" method is to allow the general public to obtain as much as possible payment instruments that they trust. With such instruments, they will naturally immediately restore their confidence, and prices expressed in these instruments can naturally be stabilized. The so-called "military" method is to impose price controls, prohibiting price increases by order, with those who raise prices facing death, or at least several years of imprisonment. The government's current currency reform measures are clearly leaning towards the latter.</p>
<p>On the eve of this reform, there were rumors everywhere that "Sun Yat-sen currency" [silver dollars] was about to be issued. But when everyone got the news in the newspapers on the morning of August 20th, they were surprised and disappointed to say, "Why is it still banknotes!" This kind of mentality is very realistic. In fact, the general public has never considered the various difficulties and drawbacks of switching to coins. But they think that the government wants them to exchange gold and silver for paper money, but they cannot exchange paper money for gold and silver. They just feel it is strange.</p>
<p>Experts have four concerns about the issue of convertibility: (1) Confiscating gold, silver, and foreign currency is not in line with the principle of private property; (2) The government probably does not have enough gold and foreign currency to exchange; (3) The price of gold and silver fluctuates at any time in the world market; (4) Gold and silver may flow into areas that the government cannot control. We believe that these considerations all have considerable reasons, and there is no need to refute them one by one. In particular, the second point is a factual question, so there is no need to argue. However, let us imagine that no matter how much gold, silver, and foreign exchange you have, if they are all used as issuance reserves, it is equal to something in a mirror to the general public. It is extremely difficult for them to quench their thirst by looking at plums. If you don't believe it, imagine if the government had announced this time that the issuance reserve was not 40% but 100% gold, silver, and foreign exchange, would the consequences be better than the current situation? Before banknotes became a problem during the war, people only knew that holding banknotes was more convenient than silver dollars. Why would they want to redeem them, and they would not pay attention to how much cash reserve was issued. But now banknotes have been a problem for nearly ten years. Regardless of whether a new type of banknote is exchanged, whether limiting the maximum issuance amount, increasing reserve funds, or strengthening supervision systems, the common people do not listen. This is a fact, and there is no need to shy away from it. Therefore, we say that if the government does not have enough gold, silver, and foreign exchange, then the opportunity for reform has not yet matured.</p>
<p>However, the drastic price increases in some places in the half-month since the reform do not necessarily mean that the reform has completely failed. Government spokespersons also made it clear to everyone that prices may rise in the short term, and there is no need to panic. Although the reason was not stated, we can imagine it. After each issuance of large banknotes, prices usually fluctuate for a while. Moreover, with the old currency not yet withdrawn, and so many new units of currency suddenly added, prices are bound to be stimulated. In addition, the government buys gold, silver, and foreign currency at high prices, and a large number of banknotes have also been released. So the current question is whether prices will gradually stabilize after this fluctuation? We need not predict. After this fluctuation, the people have painfully discovered that after three months, when the old banknotes are completely withdrawn and the limit on the new currency is close, the government may stop issuing banknotes. At that time, there may not be deflation, but a phenomenon of banknote shortage will occur again. Naturally, if the government in the near future uses the gold, silver, and foreign exchange that it has nationalized, or the property obtained from domestic people abroad, or the proceeds of foreign loans, for the convertibility of new banknotes, the situation will be completely different again.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the government's current approach still focuses on prohibiting price increases. Judging from the immediate establishment of control agencies, the intensification of economic inspections, the arrest of price-gouging merchants at any time, and the imposition of heavy fines and imprisonment, the government seems determined to be tough to the end. But we deeply fear that after a temporary storm, things will still return to their former state. We cannot help but reach this conclusion, considering the following points: (1) The people do not fear death, so how can you frighten them with death? (2) Rigidly pegging prices to a certain day is difficult to do, and should not be done, even in normal times. (3) The price of one type of goods or service is often the cost of another type of goods. If you want to allow special pricing based on cost, everything will eventually have to be adjusted. (4) Price controls must be carried out in conjunction with rationing. Regardless of comprehensive price controls, do we have any preparations for rationing even a few major commodities? In fact, the prices announced by the government on August 19 were already slightly higher than the actual prices at the time, and during transactions, there may be black market prices, or the goods may be of inferior quality, or even "temporarily closed." From the above points, we doubt whether this price control will be more successful than the one in 1932.</p>
<p>Whether viewed from a political or economic perspective, the "civilian" approach is still likely to be effective today. In fact, advocating banknote convertibility at this time has the suspicion of going backwards. But thinking about achieving an immediate effect on prices after the reform, this may be the only expedient measure for the time being. In order for the new currency to be trusted, it is also necessary to prevent prices from rising immediately after the reform. Without reform, it can be delayed for a while, but once the new currency is used for testing, then confidence is the key to everything, and the stability in this short period after the reform is a matter of life and death. If prices, calculated in the new currency, also rise and skyrocket, it will be worse than not reforming. (From Chongqing University)</p>
<h3>Profit-Making Enterprises: Capital Stock Converted to Gold Yuan; Procedures for Changing Registration; Deadline for Completion is Before February 19 of Next Year</h3>

The goal of promoting this movement is not the general hardworking masses, but the "non-working, non-producing parasitic class, as well as speculators who hoard and manipulate and use all illegal means to seize wealth," as declared by the President. It is hoped that the initiators and sponsors of this association will unite with the hardworking and frugal masses of the whole country to jointly combat the parasitic class and speculators, in order to correct the polarization of the lives of the rich and the poor, and achieve the goal of the front line being militarized and the rear being civilianized. Subsequent speakers were very enthusiastic, and all expressed their support for the organization's initiation of the diligence and frugality to build the nation movement. Subsequently, Huang Shaogu, Minister of Propaganda, read out the nine organizational principles in Section 5 of the outline of the movement. Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, elaborated on the organizational laws and regulations of the group. Chen Kewen, a member of the Legislative Yuan, then proposed to elect preparatory committee members to be responsible for drafting the charter, formulating publicity and organizational plans, and expanding the solicitation of initiators, which was unanimously passed and the election proceeded until the meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Explanation of Detaining Suspected Students; President Weng Responds to Liu Butong; Weighing National Interests and Determining Appropriate Handling</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Legislative member Liu Butong wrote to President Weng Wenhao on September 1 regarding the government's arrest of students. President Weng recently replied to Liu, explaining the government's detention of students suspected of endangering the country. In his reply, Weng stated: "The current situation is indeed much worse than before the Anti-Japanese War, which is undeniable. The reason for this is that the political situation is unstable, and the bureaucracy is corrupt, which has caused young students to feel angry and resentful. However, on the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party is actively working to spread acts of sabotage at a time when the country urgently needs stability, and is inciting anti-American sentiment at a time when US aid has just begun. Weighing national interests and the responsibilities of the government, it is impossible not to assist educational institutions in dealing with the situation appropriately. I have great sympathy for patriotic students and deeply hope that they will work for the progress of the entire country. Regarding those who have been arrested among the students, the main point of handling the matter is to quickly release innocent students and punish the guilty according to the law. Human rights will be protected in accordance with legal procedures during interrogation, so that there will be no unjust cases." Weng referred to Liu's concerns about the safety and studies of the students as "most reasonable words," and informed him that he had copied Liu's letter and his own reply and sent them to Minister Xie of the Ministry of Justice for review.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 19th Dispatch] The Zhangshu West Bank to Zhuzhou section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has officially launched a traffic vehicle service, with a total length of 356 kilometers, which can be reached in only 20 hours. There are a total of 28 stations along the way. Except for the station buildings within Hunan Province, which are permanent, the station buildings within Jiangxi Province are mostly temporary. Passengers traveling from Nanchang or Hangzhou to Zhuzhou to transfer to Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces must connect at Xiangtang. Passenger trains run daily from Xiangtang to the east bank of Zhangshu. However, due to the fact that the piers of the bridge between Zhangshu East and Zhangshu West have not yet been completed, both must rely on ferries to change vehicles. The steel bars of the Zhangshu Bridge are expected to be fully erected before March of next year. To facilitate travel, the Railway Bureau is expediting the construction of a temporary bridge near the main bridge, which is expected to be open to traffic around November. From then on, the East can connect through Hangzhou to Nanjing and Shanghai, the North can pass through Xunyang, cross the Yangtze River, and enter the Central Plains, and the West can reach the Southwest inland through Zhuzhou. It is truly a central route for the exchange of materials between Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces. It is said that the famous Pingxiang coal in the country can also use the opening of the western section of this road to solve the severe coal shortage in the southeast provinces, which will greatly benefit the entire national economy. In addition, the official opening date of the western section of the road is approximately after Double Ten Day.</p>

The focus of the attack will undoubtedly be the Marshall Plan, French rearmament, and the newly established Western European Union. In addition, the issues of Palestine, Korea, Greece, Indonesia, former Italian African colonies, atomic energy, human rights, and freedom of the press will also be the subject of East-West debate. Accompanying Marshall and his wife are State Department advisor and Soviet expert Bohlen and his wife, and special assistant General Carter.</p>

Both sides believe that this General Assembly will be a turning point, namely: After this General Assembly, either (1) the tense situation will be greatly eased, and a workable interim solution will be established between East and West; or (2) there will be a frank recognition that an arms race is inevitable in order to determine the strength of the two major hemispheres that are deadlocked.</p>
<p>The Western powers are confident that their victory over the Communist parties in Western Europe is enough to strengthen their diplomatic bargaining power. The Eastern powers hope that the appeal and power of the French Communist Party will remain strong and be able to instigate large-scale citizens' assemblies and other demonstrations in Paris to create an atmosphere favorable to them.</p>
<p>Asia</p>
<p>But it is not only the East and West, divided ideologically, that are making frantic preparations. At the same time, the geographically Eastern, the majority of Asian countries, especially India, want to use the megaphone provided by the Paris UN General Assembly to present the almost irreparable economic plight of Asia and make an appeal for help.</p>
<p>"United Nations World" magazine received a report: The governments of many Asian countries are preparing to give a clear description of the serious state of unrest in their respective countries. They will point out that economic suffering is driving people to flock to the banner of communism every day. They will urge the Western powers to provide practical assistance as soon as possible to save this desperate situation.</p>
<p>Middle East</p>
<p>Although the Arab states have not yet determined their next steps due to the long-standing unresolved Palestinian issue, they are uniting to attack pro-Israeli forces. They will even use the threat of reclaiming oil rights as leverage and may temporarily abandon their membership in the United Nations.</p>
<p>The Arab countries feel that the political environment in Paris is more favorable to them than in New York. They also feel that the French government, which is deeply concerned about the pan-Arab unrest in French North Africa, will use its position as host to influence the other 57 governments to avoid offending the Arabs.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Israelis feel that in Europe, where people are deeply aware of the suffering of Jews under Nazi forces and understand their indomitable courage in successive resistance movements, the struggle should be favorable to them. In Paris, they are confident that they will not be subjected to the consistent condemnation of the United Nations by Jews in New York.</p>
<p>Latin America</p>
<p>Central and South American countries also intend to use the United Nations General Assembly to establish closer relations with Europe. They are planning to re-establish the economic, political, and cultural ties that were interrupted by World War II and have not yet been fully restored. Some Latin American countries are even preparing to openly demand the lifting of the United Nations' ban on Spain.</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>The Franco government will send several high-ranking representatives to Paris to meet with United Nations leaders at an opportune moment. This pro-Franco offensive will be initially promoted when Latin American representatives, especially those from Argentina, pass through Spain on their way to Paris.</p>
<p>Spanish Republicans in exile, although internally divided, are awaiting strong public support from the French people. They will never give in. They feel that maintaining the United Nations' ban on Franco is the only hope for promoting reforms in his regime. The majority of Republican leaders are prepared to accept any constitutional government that is ready to eliminate Franco and the fascists under his leadership.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Italy hopes that Paris will once again make the greatest effort to overturn the veto that opposes its admission to the United Nations. This veto stipulates that Italy cannot join the United Nations alone unless Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland, and Albania join at the same time.</p>
<p>Soviet Strategy</p>
<p>Insiders predict that in the first six weeks, the General Assembly will discuss routine matters, and the larger political struggles will only be discussed after the US presidential election. But the Soviet Union does not need to wait for an opportunity to attack. It is expected that they will definitely open fire before the US election in order to take advantage of the embarrassing situation of the US delegation on the eve of possible government reforms.</p>
<p>Veto Power</p>
<p>Small countries, led by Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and the Philippines, are preparing to launch a full-scale struggle against the veto power, but they may not be able to persuade one of the five powers to loosen this fundamental concept of the United Nations at this time.</p>
<p>It is expected that the most calm and uncooperative delegation in the United Nations General Assembly will be the delegation from the Union of South Africa. South Africa has its headquarters in the famous Hotel Elysée, where it has booked the entire floor of rooms to accommodate a large team of South African representatives. They are determined to curb "the Bolshevik's ridiculous interference in South African affairs."</p>
<p>The Host of the Assembly</p>
<p>The citizens of Paris are watching these large-scale preparations with great cheers, and they are very excited to see that Paris will once again become the political capital of the world during the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The French government is doing everything it can to equip Paris to stage a great international drama. Under the guidance of Carlo, France's most famous architect and decorator, the Palais de Chaillot has been transformed into the most beautiful backdrop for the UN General Assembly, as well as the most efficient office building. Huge holes have been created in the marble walls hanging with tapestries, where electric motors and construction shafts have been installed. In September, the latest elevators will move up and down in these shafts, so that the French will no longer complain that their buildings are beautiful but lack convenient facilities. The fountains from the 1937 World Expo will be revived here, spraying millions of gallons of clear water, shimmering under the five-colored electric torches, while the most noble symphonies will be broadcast from specially built music stands.</p>
<p>"United Nations World" estimates that at least 6,000 people will participate in the General Assembly, including representatives from various countries, secretaries, officials, experts, journalists, and representatives appointed by various groups and organizations. It is expected that thousands of citizens will come from all over the world to visit this historically valuable event. The French, in particular, will be the first to see it up close.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation, the number of people participating in this UN General Assembly will be more than any previous international gathering. Because of currency exchange rates, Paris attracts more viewers than New York. Most representatives are prepared to bring a large number of consultants and experts with them, and many are also bringing their families. Although most European newspapers have only stationed a few reporters at Lake Success, they are preparing to send a large number of reporters to participate in the General Assembly this time.</p>
<p>Hotel rooms have long been scarce. The French government is trying to arrange more spacious accommodations to facilitate the audience of the General Assembly. All facilities and hospitality will be standardized to match the tastes and habits of senior diplomats.</p>
<p>In any case, the general public feels that holding the UN General Assembly in Paris is not just a temporary gathering held at a select location. It truly represents the rebirth and rising status of Europe. In New York, the UN General Assembly is often just one of many major events; in Paris, it will become the only major event.

<h3>Final Targets for Special Donation Solicitation: Major Merchants Who Obtained Official Foreign Exchange; City Government to Hold Meeting This Afternoon to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city's Special Relief Donation Solicitation Committee is scheduled to hold its meeting at the City Hall at 3 PM today for the final discussion. The city's special relief donation target is 85 trillion yuan, equivalent to just over 2 million gold yuan. The deadline was originally the end of August, but the funds have not yet been fully raised, which has caused the authorities considerable distress. It is reported that the final batch of solicitation targets are major merchants in the city who previously applied for official foreign exchange, numbering several hundred. City Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian told reporters: They have benefited greatly from being approved for foreign exchange in the past and should now fulfill their obligations. He also stated that the special relief donation has been extended to this day, and it is time to "lay the cards on the table." The publication of the list is possible.</p>
<h3>Jiangning District Expands Publicity in Response to "Thrift and Frugality Campaign"</h3>
<p>Two Thousand District Residents Participate in Costume Parade</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to support the government's currency reform, eliminate communist spies, and respond to President Chiang's call, as a citizen, to promote national reconstruction through thrift and frugality, leaders and gentry from all walks of life in Jiangning District of this city initiated an expanded publicity campaign. A meeting was held at 3 PM yesterday in Jinyuan Park on Yangzhout Road. A total of about 10,000 district residents and others attended. After the meeting, Chairman Hou Junren first reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by a training session by Fang Zhi, Director of the Kuomintang City Party Headquarters, encouraging district residents to practice what they preach and promote the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality. Subsequently, Senators Shao Yongsheng, Yan Guodong, Shi Jiadong, Liu Jingru, Chairman of the District People's Congress, Wu Zhongda, District Chief, and others delivered speeches. Finally, a telegram was passed in response to the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality. Drama performances and martial arts assistance to the military were also performed. The meeting concluded in cheers at around 5 PM. At the same time, the conference mobilized 2,000 district residents to hold a costume parade at noon yesterday, passing through various major roads in the district and distributing propaganda materials such as "A Letter to People in All Districts," creating a heated atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang City Party Headquarters Responds to the Thrift and Frugality Movement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang will convene an expanded publicity preparatory meeting at the Shanghai Club tomorrow to discuss the promotion of publicity matters in response to the thrift and frugality movement advocated by the President.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng Discusses National Reconstruction through Thrift and Frugality; Advocates Less Empty Talk</h3>
<p>Party-state elder Li Shizeng believes that in order to promote the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality, one should strive to practice and do less empty talk. He also revealed three things: no smoking, no drinking, and no eating meat, hoping that the people of the country will unanimously implement them. He recalled the work-study program of thrift and frugality initiated by Mr. Wu Zhihui and others in the early years of the Republic of China. Young people in the country who were influenced by this movement went abroad to engage in various labor work and accumulated funds to study, numbering no less than several thousand people before and after, which had a profound impact on cultivating a culture of thrift and frugality. Later, he and others organized the Jinde Association and the Social Improvement Association, advocating no smoking, no drinking, and no eating meat. He has strictly implemented this for 43 years, and many of his friends have also adhered to it unswervingly. Mr. Li is now 68 years old, but he is energetic and physically strong, which he attributes to the implementation of these three major precepts. Finally, he cited the ancient saying "Do not do a small good, and do not do a small evil," hoping that the people of the country will deeply understand and practice it, which will greatly help the promotion of the thrift and frugality movement.</p>
<h3>City Government to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Promoting Thrift and Frugality Movement</h3>
<p>In order to coordinate with the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality initiated by the President, the city's Economy Movement Committee has specifically invited relevant figures from all walks of life to hold a meeting at the City Hall at 3 PM tomorrow, presided over by Mayor Wu himself. President Yu of the Central Bank and others will be invited to attend. According to Wang Guanqing, the person in charge of the committee, the economy movement, such as economy in banquets and economy in paper, has already been promoted in the city. Now, in order to implement the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality in accordance with the President's wishes, the committee will review how to strengthen the implementation of the existing economy measures and solicit opinions from all walks of life on the newly formulated savings movement in the outline of the national reconstruction movement through thrift and frugality. President Yu of the Central Bank will also be asked to assist in launching the movement. Wang also stated that the important issues of this meeting are (1) regarding the promotion of economy measures by the Social Affairs Bureau, A. Economy in banquets. In the past, it was very difficult to thoroughly implement this due to the severe price fluctuations. Although the selling prices of restaurants were restricted, they were still adjusted repeatedly. Since the currency reform, prices have stabilized, and the prices of banquets and set meals need to be strictly re-established. B. Measures for economy in wedding, funeral, and birthday banquets should be formulated separately with the most economical standards of etiquette and widely publicized. C. The crackdown on improper entertainment should be based on the principle of prohibiting while levying taxes and advising citizens not to go to improper entertainment venues, but to earnestly promote proper entertainment. (2) Regarding the promotion of economy measures by the Public Utilities Bureau, A. Reduce the number of automobiles. The lottery elimination system may be adopted for small automobiles to study the gasoline saved and transfer it to public buses. B. Economy in electricity use. Ban the sale of electric stoves. Ban unnecessary outdoor neon lights. Fluorescent lights must be equipped with devices to regulate electricity. C. Control tap water. Adopt a progressive system. The more water used, the higher the fee. Other items, such as promoting savings, will be discussed with the Central Bank to formulate measures to encourage citizens to save. The Social Affairs Bureau will promote the development of cooperative businesses and other items.</p>
<h3>Refugees Moved to Jiangxi to Reclaim Wasteland; Ministry of Social Affairs Dispatches Personnel to Negotiate</h3>
<p>The various work relief centers established by the city's Relief Committee planned to move the refugees they housed to Jiangxi to reclaim wasteland. The committee reported this to the Presidential Office for review, and it is said that the President expressed great appreciation and has telegraphed the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to assist in the implementation. The Ministry of Social Affairs dispatched Zhang Zhaoli, Assistant to the Relief Department, to Shanghai some days ago to negotiate the implementation steps, and he is scheduled to be accompanied by Yuan Wenzhang, Chief Secretary of the Relief Committee, to inspect the various work relief centers in the city this morning. It is reported that the committee has prepared a detailed plan for the refugee relocation issue and is eager to implement it, but it has not been possible to implement it for a time because the central government has not yet issued the funds. It is anticipated that after Zhang reports back to Beijing, he will be able to present the actual situation of the city's relief work to the central government in person and assist in the strict implementation of the city's relocation work.</p>
<h3>No Meat to Eat; Xu Ming Went to the Vegetable Market and Returned Home with an Empty Basket; Authorities Determined to Arrest Those Who Illegally Manipulated</h3>
<p>After the Mid-Autumn Festival, a serious phenomenon occurred in the city. Most small vegetable markets had no goods for sale, and those few vegetable vendors who carried goods for sale were immediately bought up in an instant. Meat was the most serious case. Housewives went to the vegetable market at dawn, and all returned home with empty baskets. The seriousness of this small vegetable panic is unprecedented in recent years. It is believed that this is due to some illegal elements manipulating the situation to resist the price limits on small vegetables. The economic inspection authorities have paid close attention to this and will take action today to arrest and severely punish this group of illegal elements.</p>
<h3>Economic Inspection Meeting Decides to Strengthen Inspection Work; Strictly Prevent the Outflow of Gold Yuan Notes; Vigorously Suppress Hoarding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Economic Inspection Committee of the Economic Control Committee held its sixth economic inspection meeting yesterday. More than ten people, including Zhang Shi, Cai Longren, He Longqing, Cheng Yikuan, Yu Jilu, and Wang Sheng, attended. Jiang Jingguo presided over the meeting to review the progress of work over the past week and decided to strengthen the economic control work this week: (1) Thoroughly eliminate the black market for gold yuan notes. Because the government's period for accepting and exchanging gold and silver foreign currency is about to end at the end of this month, although state-owned banks and various entrusted exchange banks have accepted and exchanged a lot of currency in recent days, it has been found that some people are carrying it away from Shanghai in an attempt to evade control. Therefore, the management authorities have decided to mobilize all forces to strengthen the inspection network in all aspects of land, sea, and air, absolutely preventing the private carrying away from Shanghai, and stepping up the search and arrest of illegal gold yuan note black market elements in the city. (2) The thorough investigation of hoarding, a general economic control measure, will also continue to be strengthened, and all efforts will be made to suppress speculative hoarders.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Scalpers Still Active as Before; Fisheries Industry Figures Reveal the Inside Story</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new economic policy, due to the authorities' strict enforcement of the "August 19" prices, the supply of some goods has been manipulated by scalpers. Recently, the activity of fish scalpers has become even more rampant. According to fisheries industry figures who spoke to reporters yesterday: Although the authorities are arresting and suppressing fish scalpers all day long, their activities are often difficult to detect because they have no special markings, which often makes it easy for inspectors to be deceived. He specially described the current distribution of fish scalpers in order to help all sectors understand the recent situation of the fish industry:</p>
<p>(1) In the Yangshupu Jiangpu Road fish market, due to the recent shortage of fresh fish, a distribution method is adopted. All fish vendors must line up in order to purchase goods. Therefore, illegal fish vendors send out female family members and even recruit unemployed vagrants to apply for membership certificates from the Fish Vendors Association, crowd into the ranks of fish vendors, obtain more fish, and increase their income.</p>
<p>(2) The 16th Pier has always been the main base for fish scalpers. It is said that there are now two ways to take advantage of the situation: A. Cunning fish vendors know that the fish market must comply with price limits and line up to purchase goods, so they use unscrupulous fish industry elements to intercept goods imported at railway stations, ports, and suburban areas (such as the main roads from Pudong and Qingpu to Shanghai) and directly transport the various fish goods to the 16th Pier to sell at higher prices through enticement and threats. If economic police officers inquire, they falsely claim that the goods were transported from the market and that the transportation costs and profits need to be increased, so the selling price needs to be increased. The inspectors are easily deceived by this glib talk. B. Another type of cunning fish vendors uses the single-handed running method of the enemy and puppet period, secretly going to nearby counties to sell fish and shrimp, covering the goods with clothes and bedding to avoid the attention of inspectors, and directly selling them at high black market prices to major restaurants and other wealthy diners in order to make huge profits.</p>
<p>The fisheries industry figure hopes that the authorities will protect legitimate fish merchants, so that the fish industry can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Import of Luxurious Cars Reported; Supervisory Office Thoroughly Investigates</h3>
<p>The Su-Zhe District Supervisory Committee of the Executive Yuan recently received another secret report accusing a senior official of a certain agency in the city of colluding with foreign car companies to privately import a large number of luxury cars. Since the government stipulated that cars worth more than 1,200 US dollars are prohibited from import, foreign car companies in the city have colluded with senior officials of certain agencies to privately import a large number of the latest luxurious cars produced in 1949, all of which are worth more than 1,200 US dollars. After receiving the report, the Su-Zhe District Supervisory Committee of the Executive Yuan attached great importance to this matter and has dispatched personnel to conduct an investigation.</p>
<h3>Taiwan and Huainan Mines Transport Coal to Supply This City</h3>
<p>After the Beining Railway was damaged again by communist bandits, the coal source of Kaifeng was interrupted again. Now, in order to maintain the original amount of coal source, the fuel coal control authorities have specially urged Taiwan and Huainan mines to transport coal to Shanghai. It is reported that the Huainan Coal Mine will ship 6,000 tons of fuel coal to Shanghai today on the Luxing Fast Ship, and more than 10,000 tons of coal can also be transported from the Taiwan Coal Mine this week.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Housing Lottery; Compiling Budget Plan to Continue</h3>
<p>After the currency reform, prices of various commodities have gradually stabilized. The second phase of the housing charity lottery, which has been shelved for a long time, will be planned for implementation again. Before the currency reform, the housing charity lottery department was unable to proceed smoothly due to the difficulty in purchasing land and building materials. Now, Mayor Wu is encouraging the construction of houses on vacant land, and the purchase of land and building materials all have fixed market prices. In the future, prices will not rise again under the long-term control system. Issuing housing charity lottery tickets to solve the housing shortage for citizens is appropriate at this time. The housing charity lottery department is now compiling various budget forms. Mayor Wu expressed his willingness to strive for promotion.</p>
<h3>Advertising Industry Association Re-elects Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The City Advertising Business Association held its third general meeting at 159 Zhejiang Middle Road on the second floor yesterday. Zhang Hanyun, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Lianze, a representative of the City Party Headquarters, and Yu Yulin, a representative of the City Chamber of Commerce, attended. In addition to the chairmen Lu Shoulun, Sun Zuisheng, and Hu Tanming reporting on association affairs and discussing proposals, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. As a result, Lu Shoulun, Hu Tanming, Lu Meiseng, Wu Yunmeng, Ni Gaofeng, and Hu Xiongfei were re-elected as directors; Sun Daosheng and Cui Quansheng were re-elected as supervisors; Lu Dongsheng, Xue Shisheng, Zheng Xiaolun, Yu Jing, Yuan Jinchun, Wang Zhonglin, Cui Jialiang, Kang Jiyao, and Wang Shouru were elected as new directors; and Shen Qiuyan and Wu Zhuoran were elected as new supervisors.</p>
<h3>Money Market Continues to Loosen; Black Market Interest Rates Drop Again; Capital Flows Back from South China; Hoarded Goods Appear on the Market</h3>
<p>Over the past week, the money market in the city has become even more relaxed. Although it is the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement period, the relaxed situation of the money market is unprecedented in the past. The four banks and two bureaus had a total deficit of 1.304 million yuan last week. The black market interest rate dropped to 7%, and banks and firms all felt it was difficult to lend money. The money market may continue to loosen this week because (1) a large amount of capital is flowing back to Shanghai from South China, and (2) prices are stable, and hoarded goods are appearing on the market, and there is an abundance of idle capital in the market. According to an observation by an economist, the loosening of the money market and the reduction of black market interest rates have a good impact on legitimate industries because the reduction of black market interest rates can invisibly reduce costs, which can indirectly promote production and stabilize prices. However, the authorities must not relax economic controls, lest speculators use low-interest idle capital to hoard goods.</p>
<h3>National Identification Cards to be Reissued; Plan to Print Rice Ration Coupons on Them</h3>
<p>The city government plans to reissue national identification cards in the near future and plans to print the per capita rice ration coupons issued by the Civil Food Distribution Council on the identification cards in order to save paper for rice ration coupons. However, it is not known how long the distribution of rice will continue, so a request has been made to the central government for instructions. After a reply is received, the new cards will be printed and prepared for reissue. It is reported that after the new cards are reissued, the procedures for citizens to purchase rice rations will be re-established. Citizens will be required to hold the newly issued national identification cards and go to the allocated rice store to purchase rice according to the purchase date announced by the Civil Food Distribution Council. The rice store only needs to add a "purchased" seal to the corresponding square on the ration certificate, which is a very simple procedure.</p>
<h3>A Woman in Her Seventies, Family Thriving as Before: American Elderly Woman Circles the World Sixteen Times, Visited Forty-Four Countries, Met the Empress Dowager Cixi, Recently Arrived in Shanghai by Ship with Only Twelve Pounds of Luggage</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the "America" transport ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying Miss Bali Xu, an extraordinary American woman with silvery white hair in her seventies. She is the number one female traveler in the world, having wandered around the world sixteen times in the past fifty years, and is truly traveling for the sake of traveling. Wherever she travels, she carries nothing but luggage weighing only nine pounds. Although Miss Bali Xu is now in her twilight years, she still raises her spirits to make her seventeenth trip around the world. This time, the luggage she carries weighs twelve pounds.</p>
<p>Started Traveling at Seventeen</p>
<p>Miss Ba is not only a traveler, but also a writer and an amateur artist. Since she broke away from married life at the age of seventeen and plunged into the Western gold rush, her life has been filled with romances, adventures, and all kinds of novel experiences in remote corners of the world. She has been to the desolate Siberia, the scorching Gobi Desert, the frozen poles, the markets of Baghdad, and the semi-civilized Pacific islands. She has also come to China and met the Empress Dowager Cixi in the Forbidden City in Beijing.</p>
<p>Wandering in Exotic Lands Without Spending a Penny</p>
<p>During the last war, she fulfilled another long-cherished wish: to travel freely in Afghanistan. Previously, she had once disguised herself as a pilgrim and tried to sneak into Afghanistan, but was discovered when she was about to succeed. What makes her travels different is that she does not need a lot of money. On the contrary, she often spends nothing. Miss Ba once said, "One must seize opportunities in life." A long time ago, she seized the opportunity to enter Outer Mongolia without permission. When the Yunnan-Burma Highway was newly opened in 1940, she hitched a ride on a military truck and traveled for twenty days. As for this trip to the East, when the ship passed Yokohama, she managed to disembark at the last minute and then arbitrarily took fifteen Allied Commander-in-Chief long-distance buses to wander around Tokyo and Osaka. Miss Ba recalled her hitchhiking experience and said, "I followed the American soldiers onto the bus. They didn't ask who I was, and I didn't ask them where the bus was going." In this way, Miss Ba enjoyed the most meaningful trip as she pleased.</p>
<p>Reliving Old Dreams, Beiping is the Best</p>
<p>Miss Ba plans to sightsee in Shanghai for more than ten days, and will revisit Beiping at the end of this month to relive her old dreams of forty years ago. She said that compared to wandering in more than forty countries, Beiping gave her the best impression.</p>
<h3>British and American Scholars Convert to the Three Jewels</h3>
<p>The Dharma Assembly for Protecting the Nation and Eliminating Disasters Concludes Successfully</p>
<p>The Dharma Assembly for Protecting the Nation and Eliminating Disasters, presided over by Master Neng Hai, held a successful prayer yesterday at the Jingye Society on Changde Road. Thousands of people attended the assembly. Led by Li Sihao, Huang Hanzhi, and others, the congregation bowed to the master. The master continued to explain the wonderful Dharma of the Avatamsaka Sutra. Master Neng Hai also responded to the requests from all sectors of the city to transmit the Three Refuges and Five Precepts. At that time, nearly a thousand people converted, including British and American scholars traveling in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>A Pedicab Overturned by a Collision: Female Passenger Dies Tragically, Pedicab Driver Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At about 2:10 PM yesterday, the 15th public bus (Registration Number 03-0469) traveling on Wanping Road and Jianguo West Road, driven by driver No. 761, crashed into a roadside tree trunk due to excessive speed, overturning the pedicab in front of it. The pedicab driver, Li Yougu (from Fuyang), 41 years old, was injured in the head and face. The passenger in the pedicab, Ma Xuezhen (female, 21 years old, from Anhui), had her chest crushed by the wheels, and her intestines flowed out, dying on the spot. Afterwards, the police officer nearby arrived and quickly sent the injured and deceased to Zhongshan Hospital. The driver was taken to the Xujiahui Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>To Reduce Losses, the Civil Affairs Commission Directly Distributes Food Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen work efficiency and reduce unnecessary losses, Lu Guixiang, Director of the Allocation Department of the Civil Affairs Commission, is piloting a direct distribution method without transferring goods to warehouses. This can eliminate the need for weighing, leakage, and storage loading and unloading. It not only reduces manpower and saves time and money, but also ensures that the amount of rice remains intact. The amount of transportation can reach 26,500 shi per day. This method has been successfully tested after the Zhou Fuyu ship transported grain to Shanghai. In the future, it can save a lot of manpower and material resources.</p>
<h3>Women's Progressive Association Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Progressive Association, organized by female painters Shen Yan and Zhou Lian She, held its inaugural meeting at 82 Kunshan Road at 9 AM yesterday after the organization was ready. At the meeting, Shen Yan, Jin Qijing, Zhou Lianxia, Bao Yahui and other twenty-one people were elected as directors.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Extorts White Rice, Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wang Chengtian, a police officer from the North Railway Station Police Branch, was assigned to duty at the Xinjiang Road post on May 16th of this year. A resident, Shi Bingran, reported to him that Ni Jinping of the Tongqing Rice Shop on Xinjiang Road refused to pay for rice that Shi Xisong had bought on his behalf and requested that he go to investigate. At that time, trainee patrol officer Lin Weichi also patrolled the post and went to the Tongqing Rice Shop with Wang to investigate. It was true. Shi Bingran and others measured thirteen shi of white rice, which was to be handled at the North Railway Station Branch. When the rice was loaded to the entrance of the Juxing Tea Garden on Zhejiang North Road, Wang invited Ni upstairs for tea and asked Ni to provide four shi of rice for a settlement. Ni did not agree, so Wang turned to Shi and others to demand two shi of rice, which he hid in the stove room of the teahouse. He then reported to the police station that Ni was operating illegally. After the bureau sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, it was determined that Wang and Lin had jointly committed corruption, and Shi Xisong had colluded to commit fraud. They were all transferred to the First District Court. After trial, the verdict was announced: Wang Chengtian was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for using his position to extort property. Lin Wei was found not guilty. Shi Xisong's part was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Tram Crowded on the Bund Late at Night: Navy Personnel Clash on the Tram, Ticket Sellers and Drivers Injured, One Navy Personnel Also Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At about 10:15 PM last night, Tram No. 22 on Line 11, which runs between Hongkou Park and the Yangjingbang on the Bund, was passing North Sichuan Road when a person wearing a navy uniform and a person in plain clothes boarded the tram. The ticket seller, Xia Zhizhong, asked the person in plain clothes to buy a ticket. The person replied that he was a soldier and refused to buy one. When the tram arrived at the Bund on Nanjing Road, Xia asked the person in plain clothes to buy a ticket again, and a conflict broke out. As a result, Xia was slapped by a navy soldier. The matter was settled after other passengers intervened. The navy soldier and others got off at the Nanjing Road intersection and left. The tram drove straight to the end of Yangjingbang and then turned back to Hongkou Park. Who knew that when the tram reached the Bund on Nanjing Road, there were more than twenty navy soldiers gathered there. They boarded the tram and beat the ticket seller Xia Zhizhong, Ding Guangui, and Pei Chengjin. Pan Afu, a driver of No. 803 who was off duty and passing by, was also injured. At the same time, Li Cang was slightly injured on the navy side. Afterwards, the Huangpu Police Branch, which was in charge, rushed police officers to the scene. The Garrison Command and the Navy Disciplinary Team also sent personnel to the scene to investigate the truth. It was not resolved until 1 AM this morning. There were fifty to sixty trams stopped on the Bund.</p>
<h3>The Total Population Census Crowns the City with 5,040,000 People: Songshan and Penglai Districts are the Most Densely Populated. Wusong and Zhenru Districts are the Least Densely Populated.</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities of this city, under orders during the period of suppression of the rebellion, have strictly managed the population to ensure public security and as a reference for policy implementation. The police bureau and the civil affairs bureau jointly conducted a city-wide population census, which has attracted much attention since the investigation began on the first day of last month. According to Director Yu Shuping, the general situation of the city-wide population census is as follows:</p>
<p>The bureau felt that the responsibility was great when it was ordered to jointly conduct the city-wide population census with the civil affairs bureau. Because the city has a vast area and complex residents, accurate recording can not only provide a basis for all policy implementation, but also ensure the stability of clearing out traitors and maintaining public security. Therefore, in addition to the personal supervision of the officers and police to strengthen the work, the bureau and the civil affairs bureau made detailed plans before the implementation and decided that 00:00 on August 2nd, 37th year (1948) of the Republic of China would be the standard date and time for the city-wide census. In addition to mobilizing all the officers, police, and auxiliary police of the bureau, the district offices, district chiefs, household registrars, and baojia chiefs also assisted, totaling about 50,000 people, and the city was divided into 4,800 groups to start working. By the afternoon of August 20th, the city-wide census was successfully completed. On the 21st, the supervisors conducted random checks, audits, and classified statistics. The preliminary statistics have now been completed.</p>
<p>Accelerating the Sorting of Industry Classifications</p>
<p>The original data for this statistic used the tally mark calculation method and was sorted by computer to completely eliminate duplicate populations. The city has a total of 984,152 households. The domestic population includes 2,714,554 men and 2,289,403 women, totaling 5,003,957 people. The foreign population includes 20,209 men and 18,081 women, totaling 38,290 people. The total population is 5,042,247 people. In addition, at 00:00 on the morning of the standard date for the population census, the floating population included 3,405 passengers disembarking at stations and docks, 17,491 tourists residing for less than one month, 13,077 transit ships, 15 transit troops, 8,190 homeless refugees, 1,914 beggars, and 2,502 others, totaling 46,594 people. After further analysis, the population distribution showed that the area occupied per person was 0.0000119 square kilometers, there were 8,299 people per square kilometer, the average household size was 5 people, men accounted for 54.23% of the total population, women accounted for 45.77% of the total population, ordinary households accounted for 73.05% of the total households, temporary households (slum households) accounted for 14.4% of the total households, industrial and commercial households accounted for 9.2% of the total households, and government and school households each accounted for 1%. The population density was highest in Songshan and Penglai districts, and lowest in Wusong and Zhenru districts. In addition, the analysis and statistics of the occupations, education levels, and places of origin of the people surveyed are currently being accelerated and will be published in the short term.</p>
<p>Facial Number Check for Convenience</p>
<p>The bureau has a city-wide population card system, and it is very convenient to find out the situation of citizens with just one minute of inquiry. After this census, in order to seek more scientific management, the facial number analysis method invented by Wu Yan, chief of the bureau's household registration section, was adopted to compile facial number cards to strictly control riots. Once this work is completed, it will be possible to capture criminals in the event of organization of the masses, prevention of bandits, fair conscription, or cases of abduction and escape, by simply remembering their faces and reporting to the police station to arrest them according to their facial numbers, which will make a great contribution to public security and administration. It is currently being processed and can be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Evasion of Registration Will Be Eliminated</p>
<p>The results of this survey will be reported to the municipal government in conjunction with the civil affairs bureau and distributed to the Economic Supervision Commissioner's Office and relevant agencies as a reference for economic reform and comprehensive distribution. I am currently studying plans to strengthen household registration inspections in conjunction with the civil affairs bureau to consolidate public security and lay the foundation for protecting the various rights of citizens. I hope that citizens will recognize this point, cooperate closely, and voluntarily apply for household registration. If they know that there are unreported or hidden populations and people of unknown origin in the neighborhood, I hope that they will report them at any time to eliminate traitors and complete the major task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.</p>
<p>According to Ruan Guangming, Director of the Administrative Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, the business household registration was also handled during this population census. There were 9,076 households. It was found that more than one-tenth of them had been operating for three or four years and had never applied for a business license from any agency, which affected the police, customs, and municipal revenue. There were also citizens in this city who did not have national ID cards and used aliases to live in hostels or hide in tall buildings in an attempt to avoid household registration. They have been investigated and will be eliminated to maintain public security.</p>
<h3>Electrical Fault After Rain Causes Disaster: Cold Storage Warehouse Fire, Five Firefighters and Police Officers Suffocate from Smoke</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A fire broke out suddenly at about 4:40 AM yesterday on the fifth floor of Qiaomao Cold Storage Warehouse at No. 20 Yangshuo Street in the Nanshi District. The flames soared into the sky. The fire department of this city and the fire brigades of various districts in the Nanshi District drove belt vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire. Due to the excessive smoke, five firefighters and police officers (Squad Leader Chen Zhizhen, one police officer, police officers No. 25, 204, and 664) suffocated from the smoke. Fortunately, they were discovered by other companions and rescued. They were rushed to the police hospital for treatment. The fifth floor of Qiaomao Cold Storage Company was filled with a large number of bran, dried goods, and other items. Due to the impact of the heavy rain, the motor wires were damaged by water and exploded. Because it was not yet dawn, no one noticed. After the electrical fault, sparks splashed into the bran, causing a fire. The fire was brought under control at about 6:30 AM. It is said that Qiaomao suffered heavy losses.</p>

<h3>The Main Culprit in the Changsha Campaign: Japanese War Criminal Kanda, Indicted, Military Court Scheduled to Hold a Public Trial on the 23rd</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Kanda Masatane, a Japanese war criminal who was recently handed over to the Allied Headquarters by our delegation to Japan and escorted from Tokyo to Shanghai, has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Shi of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense of this city and has been indicted. The president of the court, Shi Meiyu, will personally preside over a public trial at the court at 9 AM on the 23rd. The indictment is as follows:</p>
<p>Defendant: Kanda Masatane, male, 59 years old, from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, former Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army, formerly served as Commander of the 6th Division and Commander of the 17th Army. The above-named defendant has been deemed indictable after the investigation of a war crime case (No. 148 on Zhan Zhen Zi (War Investigation) in the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948)).</p>
<p>(A) Facts: The defendant Kanda Masatane is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy and the Army University. He has served as the First Chief of the Education Directorate General of the Japanese Army Major General, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters, and other positions. During the Sino-Japanese War, he served as the Commander of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army Lieutenant General on April 1, 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China (1941), stationed in Yuezhou, Changsha, Linxiang and other areas of Hunan. The defendant led troops to participate in the Second Changsha Campaign in August and the Third Changsha Campaign in December of the same year. During the combat period, his subordinates killed our civilians Yu Jianbao, Liu Dongsheng, Pan Yuebo, Liu Xiuxun, and others, raped women Li Chen Shi, Xiao Kong Shi, and others to death, set fire to more than 30 houses of Yu Shengquan and others, and robbed Liu Yizhu and others of five ancient calligraphy and paintings, as well as livestock, clothing, furniture, grain, and other items. After the victory, Kanda Masatane sneaked back to Tokyo, was captured by the Allied Supreme Commander, and was escorted to this court for investigation by our delegation to Japan.</p>
<p>(B) Evidence and Infringed Articles of Law: It is found that Kanda Masatane took over as the commander of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army on April 1, 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China (1941), stationed in Yuezhou, Changsha, Linxiang and other areas of Hunan, and led troops to participate in the Second and Third Changsha Campaigns, which is the fact admitted by the defendant and corresponds to the record in the War Crime Investigation Form sent by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. His subordinates successively robbed farmers Li Lunxian, Liu Yizhu, and others of ancient paintings, furniture, clothing, livestock, grain, and other items, set fire to more than 30 houses of Yu Shengquan, Long Shengan, and others, killed civilians Yu Jianbao, Liu Dongsheng, Pan Yuebo, Liu Xiuxun, and others, and raped women Li Chen Shi, Xiao Kong Shi, and others to death in Taizhong Township, Zhongfang Township, Wangjia Village, Yongmei Township of Yuezhou, Qingji Township of Changsha, and other places in Hunan from April 12th, 30th year (1941) of the Republic of China (1941) to January 2nd, 31st year (1942) of the Republic of China (1942). The victims and witnesses Li Lunxian, Long Shengan, Liu Yizhu, Xiao Yinchu, Zhou Shaoqi, and others have made separate testimonies (see attachments 1 to 6), which are sufficient to be adopted. During the interrogation by this court, the defendant first claimed to be unaware of it, and then claimed that it was not done by his subordinates, which was nothing more than empty words to evade responsibility. As the defendant is an officer in a supervisory and command position, he did not prevent or stop the atrocities of his subordinate troops continuously killing civilians, raping women, robbing, and wantonly destroying property. According to Article 9 of the Regulations on the Trial of War Criminals, he should be held jointly responsible. In accordance with Article 26, Article 2, Paragraph 2, Article 3, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 4, Article 24, and Article 27 of the same regulations, a public prosecution is filed.</p>
<h3>Postal Employees' Treatment: The Central Government Agrees to Give it Further Consideration</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Results of Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of postal employees, after the implementation of the new economic policy, it has been greatly reduced according to the provisions of the plan to strengthen economic control, which has caused panic among general postal employees. Wang Zhenbai, chairman of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, and Shui Xiangyun, standing director of the National Postal Workers' Union, appealed to the authorities in Beijing and Shanghai for remedy. It is learned that the Federation of National Postal Workers' Unions also held a board meeting in the capital a few days ago. Regarding the issue of treatment, each director petitioned the authorities of the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Social Affairs to state their grievances and request improvement. The competent authorities expressed great sympathy for the requests of postal employees and agreed to give it further consideration under the principle of not violating laws and regulations, so that the lives of employees can still be stable. The directors were satisfied and have left Beijing to return to their original places. Shui Xiangyun, the postal union director from this city, also returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning.</p>

<h3>The Sound of Ten Thousand Soldiers: The Haining Tide</h3>
<p>— By Our Correspondent, Yang Shusheng</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Haining, 17th of this month] The "Haining Tide" is a world-renowned spectacle, both ancient and modern. When the tide arrives, its force is like ten thousand horses galloping. It is especially fierce during the spring and autumn tide seasons. The occurrence of the sea tide is due to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon. When the moon is close to the Earth, the tide is particularly strong. Because of the direct alignment, the seawater is pulled upwards, rising above the horizontal line to become a river tide. On the opposite side, the Earth is pulled back, also resulting in a high tide above the horizontal line. Furthermore, because the seawater is drawn and displaced, the water level is at its lowest. Therefore, the tide comes twice every day and night. The most famous locations for observing the tide are Hangzhou and Haining. Later, due to changes in the river tide, after the tide passes Beida, excessive sand accumulation has diminished its force by the time it reaches Hangzhou. Therefore, the Hangzhou tide is no longer worth seeing. However, after the tide enters Hangzhou Bay, it is blocked by sandbanks on the opposite shore, causing it to surge northward towards the Haining seawall, shaking the earth. Thus, the "Haining Tide" has been famous since the Southern Song Dynasty. With the arrival of the autumn flood season, the "Lonely Soul Tide" and the "Sea King Parade" follow one another. The eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month is traditionally regarded as the "Tide's Birthday." Every year, many visitors come from afar to witness the tide. The bustling scene in Haining City is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Rejuvenation of the Town</p>
<p>During the war of resistance, the seawall fell into enemy hands, was neglected in repairs, and suffered significant damage. As a result, the tide flooded inland. Consequently, the river channels within the city were completely silted up after the victory. Through the diligent efforts of the Zhejiang Seawall Works Bureau and the local government, the Hangzhou-Haining and Changning highways have been successively repaired and opened to traffic. The three major seawall rivers of Haining, Ningyuan, and Zhangjiang have also been dredged in sequence. However, due to the severe damage to the town and the difficulty of recovery, the Haining County government has not yet returned to govern from the town but operates from the Xiashi Town along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. The town has become an ancient city, desolate and bleak. However, every Mid-Autumn Festival, with the arrival of the tide-watching season, the town of Haining begins to revive. The seawall is now crowded with tourists from near and far. All kinds of temporary shops and vendors also flock to the town to conduct their once-a-year business.</p>
<p>Spectacle of the Night Tide</p>
<p>There is a local saying about watching the Haining Tide: "The first and fifteenth, the tide peaks at noon; the eighth and twenty-third, the tide comes in the morning and evening; the tenth and twenty-fifth, the tide peaks at dusk." Therefore, the first and fifteenth of the lunar month are the grandest, with the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month being the peak. The first high tide is in the late morning, and the second is in the afternoon. The night tide is an even more spectacular sight than the daytime tide. When the moon hangs brightly in the sky and the river is still, the wind suddenly changes, and a line appears in the east. Moonlight reflects on the silver waves, sparkling like snow. Waves roll like thunder, rushing and twisting, with a force like mountains galloping, making one's hair stand on end. The rumbling sound is deafening. Hence, the ancients praised it as "The sound of ten thousand soldiers in the midnight tide."</p>
<p>The Beautiful Scenery of the Tide</p>
<p>When the tide comes, it appears as a distant line, like a ribbon or a sash, gathering and scattering. In an instant, it changes a thousand ways, with leaping pearls and surging foam, like silver scales of dragons, one before the other, rising and falling. During major tides, the tidal bore can reach several feet high, sweeping over the seawall, its force astonishing. After the initial surge, the remaining force remains strong, the waves swift and rapid, and the sea surface rises several feet. The tidal bore is silvery-white, surging forward. At that moment, the second tide rushes in from the south, crashing against the bank. The sound is incessant, like mountains collapsing and the sea overturning. Then, the tidal bore rushes westward. After the tide passes, the river water is murky, and reeds and broken wood float along with the waves. The raging waves rise and fall, and the water level has risen. The ships docked along the seawall raise their anchors and set sail, creating another beautiful natural scene. Chen Shidao of the Song Dynasty wrote in his poem "Watching the Tide on the Eighteenth Day": "The year's grandest spectacle is today, how does the water god know to come late? Sea waves follow the mountains' rise and fall, and sails float with the traveler." Facing this scene, it is truly a joy of the world.</p>
<p>However, the local people of Haining do not regard the "Eighteenth Day of the Eighth Month" tide as a miracle. Aside from ignorant rural farmers gathering by the seaside, wearing yellow cloth bags around their necks and holding incense sticks, kneeling and worshiping the tide as it arrives, most are simply "joining the fun." Therefore, there is a saying, "On the fifteenth of the eighth month, watch the sea tide; on the eighteenth of the eighth month, watch the people tide." Every year on the eighteenth of the eighth month, the bustling scene is unprecedented, and there is barely room to stand by the seawall.</p>
<p>The Tragic Fate of Salt Farmers</p>
<p>Last year's tide-watching season saw the accretion of tens of miles of sand outside the Haining seawall, which restrained the force of the tide, so there was no magnificent spectacle. However, this year, the sand accretion outside the seawall has been completely washed away by the raging tide, and the force of the tide has returned to its original grandeur. Earlier this month, due to the typhoon, the tide surged over the seawall, inundating salt fields in areas such as Yuanmu in Ningxi. Tens of miles of seawall and stone embankments were damaged. More than a hundred salt farmers were swept away by the raging tide and went missing, their fate unknown. The livelihood of the salt farmers has been cut off, and cries of misery are heard everywhere. They are camping along the seawall, crying out for food. A committee to aid the disaster-stricken salt farmers has now been formed, and it has been decided to mobilize students from county schools, Lizhi Middle School, Jianshi, and Yanzhong to sell flowers for charity and expand fundraising to benefit tourists. Therefore, this year, there are many students running along the Haining seawall for justice, fearlessly appealing for the disaster-stricken salt farmers.</p>
<p>Rushing to Repair the Collapsed Seawall</p>
<p>After the victory, the Zhejiang Seawall Works Bureau devoted all its efforts to rushing to repair the collapsed seawall in the county. To curb the force of the tide, water-diverting dams were built in areas such as Mugang, Chenwengang, Jianshan, and Qilimao. However, due to the overwhelming force of the tide, dams were built and collapsed, and all have now been swept away by the raging tide. Near Zhuhui, the ten stone embankments with the characters "Gao," "Guan," "Xian," "Jia," "Du," "[blank]," "Zhong," "Li," "Cheng," and "Meng" were completely destroyed. Countless wooden embankments were also washed away. The safety of the seawall has a significant impact on the people of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. The County Council and local organizations have sent telegrams to the provincial authorities, urging them to accelerate thorough repairs. The Seawall Works Bureau has also launched an emergency repair project and is now planning to use sea sand to block the seawall, thereby protecting its safety. This plan has already achieved initial results. A sandbank about five miles long has appeared on the sea surface ten miles outside the South Gate. While this may greatly benefit the seawall's security, the world-famous "Haining Tide" may be submerged. However, to protect the seawall and the safety of the people, this is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Haining has many scenic spots and local specialties. Scenic spots include Xiashi Shuangshan, Huangwan Jianshan, and along the seawall are the Sea God Temple, Zhenhai Pagoda, Daguan Pavilion, Little Putuo, Seaside Park, Anguo Temple, Anlan Garden, etc. Local specialties include watermelons, peaches, winter vegetables, white chrysanthemums, du cloth, sugarcane, silk floss, and crispy candy, all of which are inexpensive and high-quality local products, worthy of introduction to tourists. The truth of the jealous murder has come to light.</p>
<h3>The Jiading True Sage Bloodshed Case: The Murderer Ding Qingxiang Apprehended</h3>
<p>The Truth of the Jealous Murder Has Come to Light</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiading, 16th of this month] A tragic murder occurred in Zhengsheng Township, a county territory. The victim, Hua Liangsheng, was sent to Renji Hospital in Shanghai for treatment immediately after the incident, but is still in danger. The murderer, Ding Qingxiang, is a stonemason who also runs a butcher shop in Huangdu Town. He has a wife and a concubine. Ding's wife is Hua Liangsheng's cousin, and there were allegations of indecent behavior between them. Ding had long harbored the intention to kill Hua but had no opportunity. On the morning of the incident, Ding rode a bicycle to the scene, hiding near a deserted tomb, waiting for an opportunity. Hua was returning home from buying vegetables, passing by the location. Unprepared, he was hacked in the head. Seeing his objective achieved, Ding returned to Huangdu, changed his blood-stained clothes, and fled. When the county police bureau and detectives arrived at Huangdu, Ding had already fled far away. They took Ding's wife and apprentices to the county for questioning and seized the blood-stained clothing at his home. It was revealed that Ding had fled to Taihu Lake in Suzhou. The Nanxiang Police Sub-Bureau and the Zhengsheng Township Office learned that Ding was hiding in the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road in Shanghai and sent personnel to Shanghai to coordinate with the Old Zha Sub-Bureau. They went to the hotel address and apprehended Ding in Room 304. After questioning, he confessed without denial and has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fake Gold Yuan Found Disguised as Customs Gold in the Suburbs of Beiping</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping, 19th of this month] Fake Gold Yuan notes created by modifying five thousand Customs Gold Notes have been found in the suburbs of Beiping. Two red lines are drawn above the character "Five," and the characters "Gold Yuan" are printed below. The police bureau is investigating the source.</p>
<h3>The Suffering of Central China</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 12th of this month] In my previous dispatch from northern Henan, I mentioned that extracting blood from the people is no longer a matter of whether it hurts, but whether they have any blood left. The former chairman of Henan Province, Liu Maoen, also repeatedly told me after the recovery of Kaifeng that the issue of Henan providing grain is not whether the people of Henan are willing to provide it, but that Henan simply has no grain. Therefore, despite the provincial government sending officials to urge collection, the commissioner's office sending personnel to supervise collection, and the county magistrate going to the countryside to sit in and collect...for example, the county magistrate of Fanshui County sent people with shackles to the countryside to urge the collection of grain this spring, resulting in the deaths of more than ten people, yet the grain collected was still less than 30%. Another example is that Guangwu County sent personnel to urge the collection of grain, crossing the county boundary to Rongyang to seize grain households, resulting in an unnecessary disturbance, and so on. However, urging collection, supervising collection, and sitting in collection cannot conjure a single grain of wheat from an empty granary in the countryside. The fierce battles in the flooded areas were unprecedented in the process of suppressing bandits: thousands of miles of plains have lost their original forms of fields. In northern Henan, there have been unprecedented floods. Although the grain shortage in Bianzheng did not start today, it is now more severe. The Henan Provincial Department of Land and Food has telegraphed the Ministry of Food for monthly grain supplies, but there has been no response in the past two months.</p>
<p>Years of war have left the people extremely impoverished, yet there are many levies and frequent corvée labor. This is a headache for the town chiefs and ward heads who specialize in handling levies. Eight of the nine town chiefs in Zhengzhou City have submitted their resignations to the county magistrate. In the Kaifeng newspapers before the fall of Kaifeng, the words "collapsed ward" and "destroyed village" could be seen almost every day.</p>
<p>A collapsed ward or a destroyed village means that the township ward head and ward head have been forced to run away by those urging and demanding grain to avoid being beaten. In the worst cases, all the ward heads and ward heads in more than 20 streets in Kaifeng City had fled. The troops demanding grain would arrest ward personnel when they saw them, detain them temporarily, and only release them when the grain was collected. As for the countryside, the death from forced grain collection seems unremarkable. Here's a joke: Chairman Feng of the Zhengzhou County Council said with tears in his eyes at a symposium: "The people have paid all their grain to the government, what else should the government want?" I casually mentioned this to another person, and he said, "I can answer on their behalf—their lives!"</p>
<p>When I arrived in Jiaozuo, several standing directors of the Coal Mine Workers' Union, Geng Xialong and Zheng Fangyu, rushed to see me. The 20-minute conversation was also full of tears.</p>
<p>The treatment of coal miners in Jiaozuo would make workers in Beijing and Shanghai laugh. Before May, their wages were only one to two million per month. From June, they began to calculate according to the index. Converted to the current price of wheat, the average person could not afford to buy one stone of wheat. Some furnace workers could not afford to buy even half a catty of flour with their daily earnings. They had nothing to eat, and the workers fainted while firing the furnace. The coal mine is an isolated island. The company has no money, and only half of the June wages have been paid. Most of the workers are surviving by selling things. When they return home, their wives and children cry in their threadbare coats. Yet they still have to bear the levies. In June, a worker surnamed × received a notice from the ward office demanding a military wheat levy of 375.2 catties, which is two and a half months' wages. In terms of military service, the ward head and ward head can arrest people at will. Recently, two technical workers were arrested. Technical workers can be deferred from military service according to the military service law, but this is a case of "heaven is high and the emperor is far away." It is impossible to get them back without buying two people and sending them away with more than twenty stones of wheat. The two ordinary workers who were arrested at the same time had no way to collect more than twenty stones of wheat, so they had to let them handle it.</p>
<p>In Jiaozuo, if households cannot pay the grain levy or the apportionment, the ward head and ward head can take their quilts and pots and use them to offset the price of three or five sheng of wheat as their rations. On the day I arrived in Jiaozuo, Zhang Dongquan, the ward head of the sixth ward in Jiaozuo, led troops to a household to demand grain. It was already noon, and the ward head wanted to eat. The household fried eggs and cooked noodles for them, but the ward head insisted on going to a restaurant. As a result, he was taken to the headquarters of a certain brigade of the garrison to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Under the dual pressure of extortion and harassment in Jiaozuo, the population is decreasing day by day. When it was taken over, there were more than 4,200 households. Now, only one-third remains. People in Jiaozuo say that if this continues for two more months, Jiaozuo will be finished. Mobilizing for the suppression of rebellion is something that the whole country should support, each doing their best in their positions. Giving money if you have money and giving effort if you have effort is a matter of principle, but the facts are somewhat different from the ideal.</p>
<p>The party secretary of Henan Province, Yan Huatang, said, "Now it's a matter of not giving money if you have money, and giving even more money if you give effort." The chairman of the Zhengzhou Farmers' Association said even more painfully, "If you teach them to give effort and then give money, please don't bully them anymore!" Looking at the many difficulties facing Central China today and recalling the peace and prosperity of Jiangnan, it is no wonder that Liu Jixue, a revolutionary elder representing the people of Henan (the provincial speaker), shouted loudly in protest. After the Battle of Kaifeng, Minister Gu Zhenggang flew to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng to express his condolences. In his talks with various sectors of Henan society, he repeatedly emphasized, "The credit lies with the country, and the misfortune lies with the local area. This kind of expression, where a region bears a heavy responsibility for the country and the nation, is a supreme honor!" But who knows that this honor is woven with countless blood and tears?</p>
<p>When Zhang Kejun, the county magistrate of Zheng County, talked to me about these things, he couldn't help but frown. He said with great emotion, "A local official can't do anything. If the levies are not strong, I will be sorry to the country. But looking at the people today, it's not a matter of what levy, but I can't even say the word 'levy'!"</p>
<p>Zhengzhou is a fortress in Central China, and it is undeniable that it places emphasis on city defense works. According to the report of the person in charge of the city defense headquarters, from September of last year to June of this year, in ten months, a total of about 10 million civilian laborers were collected (calculated at one day of work per person). This can also be calculated. Averaging ten million workers over 300 days means that 33,000 to 34,000 people have to work on the city defense works of the township every day. Although Zhengzhou has a large population, more than 100,000 are refugees from outside. The population of Zhengzhou City itself is at most between 200,000 and 250,000. After excluding the elderly, weak, women, and children, and those who have the right to be exempt from grain levies and corvée labor, the young and strong are roughly 100,000. A division shows that each person has to work once every three days during these ten months. This is also a point in Chairman Feng's painful remarks: since the War of Resistance, Zhengzhou has been working on construction every day for eleven years, but where is the construction?</p>
<p>In Kaifeng, I heard several seniors from Henan say, "The people of Henan have good physical strength and good conscience. All troops love soldiers from Henan." Because of this, Henan has provided more than 2 million soldiers from the War of Resistance to the present. Two million can roughly form 100 reorganized divisions according to the current organization. The people of Henan are not afraid to be soldiers, especially in today's rural areas where eating is a problem. The source of soldiers cannot necessarily be said to be exhausted, but there are many problems outside of the main topic of conscription.</p>
<p>Because Henan is a good place, troops with vacancies casually drag strong men in the countryside to make up the numbers. This kind of pulling does not follow formal procedures, and the strong men pulled cannot be used to offset the quota. Therefore, the military divisions and districts must still draw and collect troops. Conscription is done by using bought strong men to make up the numbers. This has almost become a public fact everywhere. With a flexible solution, there are bound to be drawbacks: the strong men are sent to the regimental or divisional areas, escape halfway, and then sell themselves again; the township ward head and ward heads take the opportunity to extort the good people and exploit the villagers.</p>
<p>It's a little different. Yan Huatang, the director of the Henan Provincial Party Department, said, "Now it's a matter of not giving money if you have money, and giving even more money if you give effort." The chairman of the Zhengzhou Farmers' Association said even more painfully, "If you teach them to give effort and then give money, please don't bully them anymore!" Looking at the four borders of Central China today and remembering the peace and prosperity of Jiangnan, it is no wonder that Liu Jixue, a revolutionary elder representing the people of Henan (the provincial speaker), shouted loudly in protest. After the Battle of Kaifeng, Minister Gu Zhenggang flew to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng to express his condolences. In his talks with various sectors of Henan society, he repeatedly emphasized, "The credit lies with the country, and the misfortune lies with the local area. This kind of expression, where a region bears a heavy responsibility for the country and the nation, is a supreme honor!" But who knows that this honor is woven with countless blood and tears?</p>
<h3>The Opening of the Autumn Cocoon Market in Wuxi</h3>

Regarding the price of cocoons, the Silk Factory Association decided to formulate two types of prices in accordance with the laws and regulations and the past regulations of the Guidance Association and directly requested instructions from the county government and the provincial government. It is understood that the provincial government has already stipulated the autumn and spring prices in Jiangsu Province and decided to officially announce them on the 18th of this month, roughly based on four stones of rice as the principle.

<h3>The Xiangtan Salt Workers Tragedy: The County Government Pursues Responsibility; The General Affairs and Accounting Personnel Flee One After Another</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Changsha, 19th of this month] After the tragedy at the Yong'an Gaoyan Salt Company in Xiangtan, all parties expressed dissatisfaction with the company's lack of precautions, especially the regulation that workers work for 70 hours, which is inhumane.

<h3>Registering Overseas Assets: Wealthy Migrants in Hong Kong Sit on Pins and Needles</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Zi Jian</p>
<p>[Hong Kong Dispatch from This Newspaper, 15th] Since the news of the government's decision to register overseas assets of Chinese citizens reached Hong Kong, wealthy Chinese in Hong Kong, especially the mainland tycoons who migrated to Hong Kong, have been in a state of panic. It is said that two reputable commercial banks with head offices in Shanghai have experienced a run on deposits in their Hong Kong branches in recent days. The tycoons are even more anxious upon hearing that the two banks send quarterly reports back to their Shanghai headquarters. Foreign banks here are already overflowing with deposits and are unceremoniously rejecting the tycoons' floating capital. Unable to deposit their Hong Kong dollars, they have no choice but to convert them into US dollars and secretly hoard them at home to see how the situation develops. In the past two days, the US dollar has bucked its previous sluggish trend and risen repeatedly, from HK$4.90 to HK$5.20 per dollar, influenced by their actions.</p>
<p>Whether the government has indeed obtained the understanding of the Hong Kong government to establish a registration office for Chinese assets in Hong Kong is still a matter of speculation and disagreement. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank's representative office in Hong Kong, the amount of foreign exchange assets held by Chinese in Hong Kong is second only to New York. Other places such as London, Calcutta, and San Francisco are not as important as Hong Kong. Guo Dehua, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, has been summoned to Beijing to discuss the registration work. This "mystery" is expected to be revealed soon. Furthermore, according to relevant statistics, the total value of banknotes issued by the three major banks in Hong Kong up to July of this year was HK$752.6 million, which is an increase of 2.58% compared to the issuance amount on June 30, 1948, and an increase of 20% compared to the issuance amount at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The proportion of banknotes issued by the three major banks in Hong Kong is as follows: HSBC accounts for the largest share at 92.52%, Standard Chartered Bank accounts for 7.08%, and the Mercantile Bank has the smallest share at only 0.4%. Before the war, i.e., on December 31, 1938, the proportions of banknotes issued by each bank were as follows: HSBC accounted for 86.81%, Standard Chartered Bank accounted for 10.94%, and the Mercantile Bank accounted for 2.25%.</p>
<p>The number of banknotes issued by each bank before the war (end of 1937) was only about one-third of the current amount, calculated as follows: (1) HSBC: $199,689,793. (2) Standard Chartered Bank: $25,172,604. (3) Mercantile Bank: $5,175,570.</p>

<p>Wuxing</p>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper] The total business tax declared by all shops in the county, when converted into Gold Yuan, is only 10,000 per month. The provincial government believes that the collection agencies are ineffective and has sent three commissioners to Lake (Wuxing) to investigate. The county chamber of commerce, fearing that merchants would be uneasy, immediately convened an emergency meeting of leaders from various industries and contacted the provincial commission several times. As a result, it was agreed that from September, the total business tax for all industries in the county would be provisionally reported and paid as 50,000 Gold Yuan (a fourfold increase), with the urban area accounting for 60% and the rural towns accounting for 40%. For August, each industry will report the actual amount, and the tax bureau will assess and approve it at its discretion to show consideration.</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices: The New Plan Achieves Initial Success, But the Future is Not Without Obstacles</h3>
<p>It has been exactly one month since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs and the implementation of currency reform, up to the end of last week. As far as the market in this city is concerned, prices have gradually stabilized, and transactions have also become normal. The initial success of the new plan is encouraging and exciting, and it is difficult to express in words. However, "the last mile is the hardest." Looking ahead to this arduous journey, we are still far from the ultimate goal of success, and we need even more active efforts and vigilance!</p>
<p>Regarding the current more prominent pathological conditions: (1) Shanghai has strict controls, while other areas have lax controls. Shanghai adheres to price limits, while other areas still have phenomena of prices exceeding the limits. (2) Floating capital is still loose and excessive, and it seems that a proper destination has not yet been found. (3) The case of commercial banks and firms transferring foreign exchange to state-owned banks has not yet been thoroughly implemented. (4) Since the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, the circulation has shrunk, which is also a major event worth noting. The registration of foreign exchange assets of citizens overseas does not seem to be proceeding actively enough.</p>
<p>More Flexible Implementation of Measures for the Export of Goods</p>
<p>Due to the authorities' ban on carrying goods out of the country in the previous week, the commodity market trend last week saw frequent declines within the price limits on Monday and Tuesday. However, after Tuesday, the Commodity Adjustment Committee decided that the application for permits to export prohibited goods would be the responsibility of the trade association to review and issue permits, and the association would report the quantity of goods permitted for export and the number of permits issued to the supervisor's office on a ten-day basis for verification. Under this stimulus of allowing exports, various goods rebounded again. Therefore, the authorities are considering a more cautious implementation of the measures for carrying goods out of the country. At the same time, the trade associations are also technically more flexible in their regulations regarding the export of goods. For example, the cotton textile, cotton cloth, and yarn merchants' associations have drafted key points for the implementation rules regarding yarn and cloth exports: (1) To avoid stimulating local market prices through yarn and cloth exports, the association may adjust them at any time depending on market price fluctuations and supply and demand conditions in various regions. In other words, the issuance of permits will be flexible: issue them widely when prices fall and suspend them when prices rise, while the selling price must absolutely not exceed the limit of August 19th. (2) To prevent yarn and cloth from evading export, hoarding and speculation in the local area, and flowing into bandit areas, the local merchant should issue a purchase certificate, and the local trade association should stamp it to prove its validity before a transport certificate can be obtained. (3) Member who obtains certificate must provide a guarantee from the industry association, and each certificate is limited to one transport. The date of return will be determined based on the distance of the area. If there is any violation of the law, the guarantor shall be jointly responsible.</p>
<p>Price Limits Are Determined One After Another, General Trend Tends to Stabilize</p>
<p>Regarding yarn and cloth, fine yarn such as Blue Phoenix still has no market. 21-count Double Horse yarn fell from 777 yuan on Monday to 750 yuan on Tuesday, but rebounded to 783 yuan on Thursday due to the stimulus of export permits, and fell back to 770 yuan at the weekend. Leading fine cloth also rose from a low price of 26.5 yuan on Monday to 28.4 yuan on Thursday, and returned to 27.5 yuan at the weekend.</p>
<p>As grain prices are stable in the producing areas and supply and demand are normal, price fluctuations are minimal. The price of white *japonica* rice on the northern and southern markets rose slightly by one jiao each on Thursday, amounting to 20.6 yuan and 20.8 yuan respectively. The highest unified standard for the selling price of edible rice converted into Gold Yuan has been determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with the People's Food Allocation Office and the Rice Merchants' Association: 23.5 yuan per *shi* for special *japonica*, 22.5 yuan for first-grade *japonica*, 22 yuan for second-grade *japonica*, and 20.5 yuan for third-grade *japonica*.</p>
<p>Edible oil is trending downward, while flour prices have risen slightly due to higher price limits. According to the price limits, the highest price for each bag of second-grade flour from the No. 1 Flour Mill should not exceed 7 yuan and 16.2 fen, and the retail price should not exceed 7 yuan and 81 jiao.</p>
<p>In terms of daily necessities, soap, matches, etc., once declined but rebounded at the weekend. High-end cigarettes such as White Tin Package and San Pao Tai still have few transactions.</p>
<p>Sugar sales are relatively smooth due to the autumn season, and prices have turned firm. For example, No. 24 raw sugar stood at 281.8 yuan on Thursday.</p>
<p>Friday was the Mid-Autumn Festival. Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, silk, satin, rice, flour, miscellaneous grains, and edible oil were all closed for one day.</p>
<p>Sales of State-Owned Enterprises Are Sluggish and Stagnant</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, a total of 486,000 yuan of various stocks were sold on Monday, 404,400 yuan on Tuesday, 252,300 yuan on Wednesday, 251,500 yuan on Thursday, 60,000 yuan on Friday, and 15,400 yuan on the weekend. A total of 1,469,600 yuan was sold in six days. Combined with the total sales of 3,545,900 yuan in the previous week, the sales situation of state-owned enterprise stocks is so stagnant, which is unexpected. This small amount accounts for only a drop in the ocean of floating capital in the market, and it is far from the target of selling a total of 564 million yuan, and the reason for this is worth exploring by the authorities. In addition, there are rumors that short-term treasury bonds will be re-issued soon to absorb floating capital.</p>
<p>The President Advocates Promoting Diligent and Frugal Nation-Building Movement</p>
<p>The authorities are making every effort to promote the thrift movement. The Executive Yuan's administrative meeting previously passed the establishment of a thrift guidance committee and drafted "Measures to Save Gasoline and Reduce Vehicles," which this publication has reported on. Last week, the President, in his capacity as a citizen, advocated the Diligent and Frugal Nation-Building Movement and issued ten covenants as standards for implementation.</p>
<p>As for the items to be practiced, they are now determined as: A, Regarding the promotion of diligence: (1) Self-reliance and self-help. (2) Punctuality. (3) Promote the National Health Movement. (4) Guide young people to study diligently and create nation-building cadres. (5) Assist refugees in employment and develop production work. (6) Promote total war and implement total mobilization. B, Regarding strict thrift: (1) Conserve the use of public property and gasoline consumption. (2) Conserve the use of manpower. (3) Conserve food and beverage consumption. (4) Conserve celebration and condolence entertainment. (5) Promote savings and conserve the use of foreign currency. (6) Conserve urban water and electricity. (7) Eliminate improper entertainment. (8) Develop diversified production and consumption cooperative enterprises to achieve the goals of material adjustment and rational distribution. Regarding the ban on the import of luxury goods, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has drafted "Measures to Ban the Sale of Imported Luxury Goods," which will be implemented after being submitted to and approved by the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting.</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance: Money Supply Remains Loose During the Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>Last week, Friday coincided with the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. As a rule, around the holidays, old debts are settled, and the market needs more funds, which can tighten the money supply. However, during this first holiday after the currency reform, due to scarce market transactions and few demand orders, the supply of funds was abundant, and the money supply was as loose as before. According to the current situation, after the national banks and bureaus turned from selling to buying, the exchange result last week was surprisingly a large net outflow. The reasons for this are still nothing more than: (1) The result of the banks and bureaus purchasing large quantities of flour and foreign exchange settlement certificates, causing funds to continue to flow out; (2) Many remittances from other areas have been settled in recent days; (3) The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency has increased; (4) There is no release of goods, and there is no way to recover floating capital. Although the supply of funds is very abundant, the demanders are extremely scarce. It is estimated that the total amount of floating capital in this city has reached 200 to 300 million yuan, and the phenomenon of flooding is obvious.</p>
<p>It was originally expected that the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks this time could absorb a considerable portion of the floating capital, but from the 11th to the 17th, the total sales of stocks of five units, including China Textile, were more than 3,468,000 yuan, which is only 1% of the total floating capital in this city. Compared with the original target of selling more than 500 million US dollars of state-owned enterprises, it is even more distant. The total number of sales in a week is so small, and the number of sales per day shows a decreasing trend. According to reports, a large portion of the more than 3 million yuan in stock subscriptions includes funds from foreign merchants. From this, it is not difficult to see that if the current situation cannot be improved, even if state-owned enterprises are sold, it will still not open a way out for the depressed floating capital. How to prevent the flooding money supply from affecting prices is indeed the most noteworthy issue at present.</p>
<p>Demand Orders Are Scarce</p>
<p>Unofficial interest rates are showing a downward trend due to the loose money supply. Generally speaking, unofficial interest rates fluctuate between 7.5 and 9%, of which, although it once rose to more than 15% on Monday due to some gang's absorption, and also briefly saw a high of 15% on Thursday due to the management authorities announcing the measures for applying for permits to carry goods out of the country, it ultimately depreciated due to the ample supply of funds. Last week, the discount rate on currency also did only 2-3 yuan for day-to-day lending due to sluggish transactions and scarce demand orders. Although it once rose to 4-5 yuan on Monday and Thursday, it was very short-lived.</p>
<p>National Banks and Bureaus Have Large Net Outflows, Foreign Merchants Increase Net Inflows</p>
<p>The exchange results of national banks and bureaus showed a continuous net outflow from Monday to Friday, with a total net outflow of more than 9,399,700 Gold Yuan in five days, an increase of more than 10,400,000 yuan compared to the same period last week, which is the main source of funds for the market.</p>
<p>From Monday to Friday, foreign banks had a total net inflow of 2,236,645 yuan, an increase of more than 1,657,000 yuan compared to the same period last week. It is said that a major part of this is the income from the sale of foreign exchange settlement certificates by foreign banks.</p>
<p>Commercial banks and firms had an unusually abundant money supply last week, and orders accumulated. Interbank lending was not done at all. According to banking circles, deposits have increased fivefold or sixfold since the currency reform, but the lending business not only has not increased in any way, but has instead shown a downward trend. The loose money supply of banks and firms is mainly due to this reason. From Monday to Friday, the exchange results of banks and firms before No. 60 showed a total net inflow of 1,558,000 yuan. Although 200,000 yuan of net inflow from the Bank of Taiwan in five days was deducted, the indirect exchange between commercial banks and firms still showed a net inflow of 1,358,000 yuan, an increase of more than 7,681,000 yuan compared to the same period last week. From this, it is not difficult to see the general looseness of the money supply in the market.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate in South China Has Stabilized</p>
<p>Last week, the domestic exchange rate in this city was generally lower than the previous week. The exchange rates in Guangzhou and Xiamen in South China were stable at 24 yuan. The exchange rate in Hankou was 25 yuan at the end of the previous week, but it fell to 15 yuan on Monday and rebounded by 1 yuan to 16 yuan from Wednesday. There were no changes on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The exchange rate in Chongqing was 20 yuan at the end of the previous week, but it fell to 10 yuan on Monday of this week. However, it began to rebound to 16 yuan from Wednesday and rose again to 20 yuan on Thursday, returning to the level of the end of the previous week, which is likely related to the trend of capital flow.</p>
<p>The exchange rate in Tianjin was 10 yuan at the end of the previous week, but it fell to 5 yuan once on Monday and Tuesday of this week and rebounded to 10 yuan on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign exchange quotations, the price of gold in Hong Kong was 296.5 yuan per tael on Monday, rose once to 298 yuan on Wednesday, and fell back to the original price on Monday on Thursday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was the highest on Wednesday at 5.19 yuan, and the lowest price on Monday was 5.13 yuan. It rebounded slightly on Thursday to 5.17 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the price of jewelry gold in this city remains the same, the industry has reduced the amount of exchangeable gold again from 1 Qian to 5 Fen due to the depletion of the source, so the business is extremely sluggish.</p>
<h3>New Difficulties in Import and Export Trade</h3>
<p>Lei Fengxing Under the wave of centralized foreign exchange, the import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters were finally passed by the Executive Yuan's meeting last week and announced, totaling 42,141,000 US dollars, which is more than a quarter less than the quota for the fifth and sixth quarters. According to the Import Control Committee, the supply of major materials should not be lacking due to the reduction of import quotas because of the arrival of US aid materials and overseas Chinese capital. Indeed, the impact of this reduction in import quotas may be mitigated by the arrival of US aid materials, but the current import and export trade is still in a recession.</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of imports, it is said that it has entered a state of stagnation due to cost factors. The cost of importing from foreign countries is 10% to 20% higher than the local market price, and as high as 20% or more for steel. Goods that used to have high profits from imports, such as soda ash and saccharin, now require capital for imports, so importers have recently stopped ordering from foreign countries. According to importers, it is difficult to predict whether this phenomenon can be improved in the short term.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding export trade, according to the United Credit Information Agency: there are also many difficulties at present: (1) After the currency reform, prices in producing areas continue to rise and there is a phenomenon of panic buying, so that the domestic prices of many export goods exceed foreign prices. For example, the foreign price of Sichuan ramie is more than 300 US dollars per dan, while the domestic price is more than 1300 Gold Yuan. The foreign price of tung oil is also similar to that in China. The selling price of crude tea produced in PingShui is 80 yuan per dan, but the selling price of boxed tea after processing from crude tea in PingShui in this city is only 100 yuan. Compared with the prices in the producing areas and the market prices in this city, plus freight, the difference is too much. Therefore, exporters are unwilling to purchase goods from the producing areas. The current exports are all goods that have been hoarded by merchants in the past, and they will be sold out in a short period of time.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new measures, foreign import merchants are bargaining, and general prices have fallen back, with some falling by more than 10%. There is no profit to be made from exports.</p>
<p>In order to save the crisis in the export industry, the government has implemented limited price exports. The export industry is in a state of stagnation again under the domestic and foreign contradictions.</p>
<p>How to break the deadlock in the stagnant import and export trade is indeed one of the most important economic issues at present.</p>

<h3>Fudan Professor Xue Fen Dies En Route to England</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Professor Xue Fen, Director of the Department of Biology and the Marine Group at National Fudan University, recently accepted an invitation from the British Council to travel to England for research. He departed from Shanghai on September 1st but unfortunately passed away on September 10th in a Penang hospital due to a sudden illness. Xue was a native of Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, and was 44 years old. He graduated from Wuxi Normal School early in his life and continued his studies in biology at Tsinghua University, possessing profound academic knowledge. He obtained a doctorate in oceanography from the University of Liverpool in England through the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship. After returning to China during the War of Resistance, he successively served as a teaching assistant at Tsinghua University, a lecturer at Nankai University, the director of the Sichuan Provincial Hechuan Fish Farm, a specialist commissioner for the Executive Yuan, and a professor at National Fudan and Jinan Universities. He made numerous contributions to the academic world. Xue's death overseas is a significant loss to the academic community. Xue dedicated himself to scholarly pursuits but was not skilled in managing finances. He left behind five young children, the eldest being only in their teens. His passing has left his family in dire straits, a truly tragic situation. Colleagues in the academic community and friends are planning memorial services and discussing ways to provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Gansu-Qinghai Archaeological Team Proves Painted Pottery Culture Spread from East to West</h3>
<p>Three Years of Famine in Hexi Corridor Causes Widespread Suffering</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th] The Gansu-Qinghai Archaeological Team, led by Pei Wenzhong, has completed its investigation of the central and western Gansu and the Hexi Corridor, and has reached the preliminary conclusion that painted pottery culture spread from east to west. According to Jia Lanpo, who accompanied Pei on the work, the team has been excavating dinosaurs along the Gansu-Qinghai highway from Lanzhou to Xiangtang in Qinghai since the 10th. If financial resources permit, Liu Dongsheng and Mi Heng will be left to continue excavation, and Pei will go to the Machangyan in the east to study whether the "Machang Period" culture, as named by Anderson, is later than the "Yangshao Period". He will also take the opportunity to visit Dulan, where no archaeologist has yet set foot, and return to Beiping in early October. The team departed from Lanzhou on June 28th and went to the Hexi Corridor, first to Wuwei, Minqin, and Shajingzi, which Anderson named the "Shajing Period," obtaining abundant microliths, iron bricks, gold earrings, and painted pottery. Between Zhangye and Linze, microliths are already rare. Further west, through Jiuquan, Yumen, Anxi, Dunhuang, Nanhua, and other places, there is no painted pottery. Therefore, it is proven that the painted pottery culture spread from east to west. The Hexi Corridor has suffered three years of famine, and the people's lives are extremely difficult. Girls aged twelve or thirteen have no pants to wear. The population of Yongchang was 120,000 at the end of the Qing Dynasty, but now it is less than 45,000, but there is no shortage of the very wealthy.</p>

<h3>On "Using One's Brain"</h3>
<p>— Wang Kao</p>
<p>In Shanghai, those who don't know how to "use their brains" are fools; those who know how to "use their brains" diligently are scoundrels, or even targets of the Economic Control Commission. Therefore, Shanghai is really a society composed of a mixture of scoundrels and fools. Fools have always been exploited by scoundrels; but from now on, I hope the scoundrels will also taste some of the bitterness. Although the fools don't want to turn over and enslave others, at least they can vent some of their resentment.</p>
<p>The brain is meant to be used every day. Unless someone is dead, it won't stop moving. — In Nanjing, I met a geomancer who had a wonderful theory: even after death, the brain still moves, which is what is called the wireless electricity effect, so some people dream of ghosts and have omens of good or bad. I dare not say whether this matter has a scientific basis, but it can also be taken as an example of constant movement? — But this kind of movement is within the orbit, such as working and eating, spending money and buying things. It is normal and, rather than being human reason, it is more like instinct.</p>
<p>However, what Shanghainese call "using one's brain" definitely does not refer to this (almost not working but eating, not spending money but buying things), and if anyone interprets the term "using one's brain" in this way, they will be ridiculed by the wise. The world is truly difficult to say. I never thought that the principles and ideas that are commonly applied in other places would be completely incompatible in a metropolis. Mozi once said, "Now there is a man who says black is black when he sees a little black, and says black is white when he sees a lot of black, then this man must not know the difference between black and white." It seems that such topsy-turvy things existed as far back as three thousand years ago. Who says Chinese culture is not long-standing?</p>
<p>However, most people in the world are indeed ignorant. Taking black and white as an example, Su Dongpo's snow poem says, "The light shakes the silver sea, dazzlingly producing flowers," which is clearly a white scene, so why is it dazzling and producing flowers? There is no other reason than the word "dazzling" itself, which makes people dizzy. Therefore, "Unable to recognize the true face of Mount Lu, only because one is in the mountain itself" is also because the peaks and ridges so close at hand are indistinguishable, so one cannot figure out what the true face is. In Peking opera, the clean official who is only a seventh-rank official goes to interrogate the Grand Tutor, who is a first-rank official in the court. Even the yamen runners feel strange, so when Pan Hong arrives in front of the censor's gate, he sighs, "The small censor's yamen also has some menacing aura"! This shows that in ordinary times, they never feel that there is any censor's yamen in existence, and the censor officials, in addition to flattering the Grand Tutor, also dare not pursue his crimes. Big shops bully customers, which creates the phenomenon of people giving a thumbs up to a certain idol. When it comes to this point, not only does no one dare to say that his crimes are monstrous, but they envy his good fortune as vast as the East Sea.</p>
<p>Daring not to face reality is also to protect oneself wisely, which is also a lack of a sense of justice. Furthermore, it becomes recognizing reality, putting makeup on reality, and even flattering reality and kneeling to reality. Deviation must intensify, and there are no exceptions in the world. Some people say that although Chinese tradition is benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and filial piety, it is all said from a self-serving standpoint. Although the statement is extreme, the meaning is not without merit. At least in a place like Shanghai, no matter how bright the neon signs on the top of the International Hotel are, they are just a huge irony.</p>
<p>It is said that 75% of the disruptive forces in the country are in the Bund, and I am afraid that 75% of the integrity has also been lost in this place. Especially after ten years of war, human psychology, moral standards, and concepts of right and wrong have almost all been overturned. This currency reform is a superficial work. We hope that what follows must be even more psychological recovery and psychological revolution. If one still thinks that sooner or later it will still be the world of "using one's brain," I guarantee that nothing will be achieved. Recently, because this road is blocked everywhere, I often hear friends who "use their brains" scratching their heads and complaining, and even more meticulously and cunningly using their brains. My hope is "Sir, stop!" When a comet encounters another planet, it will shatter itself!</p>
<h3>The Harm of Drinking Too Much Water</h3>
<p>— Nan Wu</p>
<p>Most people think that drinking a little more water is not a big deal, but it is not. Not long ago, a twelve-year-old girl in New Jersey, USA, died from drinking too much water. This child was playing with her friends and drank three "quarts" of water (each quart is equal to one-quarter of a gallon) in twenty minutes, and died twelve hours later. Because her blood vessels absorbed too much water, her lungs were full of water, and all the symptoms were exactly the same as drowning.</p>
<h3>Brief Jottings</h3>
<p>— Yao Yuanchu</p>
<p>Gazing at the clear lake, autumn turns to spring again,</p>
<p>Hungry, I come seeking food, hesitant to sit among them.</p>
<p>My friend is a Zen Buddhist,</p>
<p>I, though unable to drink, can be near those who do;</p>
<p>Plum and willow should not concern themselves with worldly affairs,</p>
<p>Lofty pavilions fear harming natural innocence,</p>
<p>If this journey encounters wind and rain,</p>
<p>It will be the river dragon cleansing the dust.</p>
<h3>Sitting in the Rain Until Dusk on the Seventh Day of the Ninth Month</h3>
<p>The typhoon comes from the north, heralded by rain,</p>
<p>Sprinkling idle windows, whispering autumn words.</p>
<p>The gurgling continues all day without ceasing,</p>
<p>A pure coolness pressing against light summer clothes.</p>
<p>Listening to the rain, listening to the wind, I feel autumn even more,</p>
<p>The Songjiang and Huangpu Rivers beat against the sky.</p>
<p>To float a whole family in a small boat is rare,</p>
<p>I liken it to Sima Guang's boat on the shore.</p>
<h3>Understanding Smile</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>Reading the works of famous writers often makes me pound the table for no reason, gently caressing the page that makes me forget myself, and smile knowingly. In such smiles, I get a moment of inspiration; an unspeakable pleasure. It seems as if at that moment, I am in complete communion with the author's soul. A decade ago, reading Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe," I smiled brightly, unable to control myself. His description of Jean-Christophe as a child is so vivid, and the psychological portrayal is so profound that it inspires people:</p>
<p>"...He invented tying a broken rope to a stick and throwing it into the river in a serious manner, waiting for the fish to bite. He knew that the fish would not bite the rope without a hook or bait, but he thought that maybe it would break the rule for his sake. His confidence would never end. He even used a whip to fish in the cracks of the stone slabs in the sewers on the street. He would pull up the whip from time to time, very moved, thinking that this time it was heavier and he was going to pull up some treasure that his grandfather often talked about in stories..."</p>
<p>Reading the above paragraph, I think anyone will smile knowingly. Because almost everyone has fished in the cracks of the stone slabs in the sewers like that. I remember when I was a child, every night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I would secretly peek at the full moon, my heart beating nervously, wondering if the dragon boat that my grandmother talked about would appear. I knew that no one had really seen a dragon boat in the moon, but I thought that maybe it would break the rule for my sake. My hometown of Nanxun is said to be a blessed town because it has been spared from the ravages of war throughout the ages. Therefore, when the Anti-Japanese War broke out, when the neighboring towns were engulfed in flames, people were still thinking that maybe it would break the rule for the sake of "Nanxun." (Note: Half the town has become rubble.) In the Middle Ages, Europeans often argued about "how many angels can stand on a pin," turning red in the face. Some said three, some said four, and some said a dozen. And each one gave a full roll of reasons like a doctoral thesis. Because Europeans at that time mostly "believed" that angels could indeed stand on the head of a needle. I think we live in "ideals," and even the smartest people have to fish in the cracks of the stone slabs a few times, right?</p>
<p>Reading Gogol's "Dead Souls," the author describes the Manilov couple:</p>
<p>"...Also, for some reason, he put down his pipe, and she put down her work, and they had a long, long, soul-stirring kiss, long enough to smoke a small cigar..."</p>
<p>Such a portrayal of the Manilov couple's love, but a few words. But young people who read it are enough to cause a knowing smile. I think middle-aged people who read it may smile even more meaningfully.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the new currency system, economists, financial and fiscal experts from various schools in the old capital have published lengthy articles with their opinions every day, most of which are well-organized and comprehensive, and there is no need to comment on the rights and wrongs here. But let's briefly record the general living conditions and the self-plans of the salaried class, based on what we have seen and heard.</p>
<p>For public educators and the general salaried class, real life is the most pressing concern at present, and it is human nature to care about the details and calculate carefully. At first, when I heard that the index method was abolished and new currency notes were issued, I couldn't help but rejoice in unison. (The newspaper also said "Civil servants are better off!") Because if a person with an original salary of one hundred yuan calculates the current index, multiples, and subsidies together, it is only about one hundred million legal tender, while one hundred yuan in new currency is three hundred million (because the new regulations stipulate that one yuan in new notes is equal to three million legal tender), a sudden increase of three times, so I was overjoyed when I first heard about it.</p>
<p>Then I saw the detailed items, mentioning that under the public education item, those with a basic salary of "forty" or less would be paid in full with new notes, those with a salary of over forty to three hundred would be given two-tenths, and those with a salary of over three hundred would be given one-tenth. In this way, a person with a salary of one hundred yuan can get fifty-two, which is about two-fifths of the original salary. A person with two hundred yuan can get seventy-two, which is close to three-fifths. A person with three hundred yuan can get ninety-two, which is not enough three-fifths. A person with four hundred yuan can get one hundred and two, which is one-quarter. A person with five hundred yuan can get one hundred and twelve, which is close to one-fifth. A person with six hundred yuan can get one hundred and twenty-two, which is less than one-fifth! So the smile suddenly stopped and turned into hesitation, uneasy.</p>
<p>A teacher congratulated a tax bureau staff member, saying that since the agency he served was collecting money according to the pre-war standard, his salary must also be paid in full, so they were still benefiting. But the tax official said that although the agency said it would collect the full amount, the salaries of the money collection staff might be discounted in the same way as other public educators, so they had to wait for further news before there was a special possibility of "congratulating" them.</p>
<h3>Records of Slaying Tigers and Eradicating Flies</h3>
<p>— Song Xian</p>
<p>Li Guangdian's Diary of Defending Bian in the Ming Dynasty contains several records of profiteers hoarding goods. The diary entry for June 5th of the fourteenth year of Chongzhen reads: "The blind tiger named Yu Chun, opened a hoarding household, and was able to obtain imperial permission to trade. Since April 28th, he has been closing his door, with one tael of silver buying four sheng of wheat. Yu Chun secretly ordered the price to be raised to two dou per tael. Investigating Officer Dong personally went to Nanfang to arrest Yu Chun and beheaded him in the market. Yu Chun said before his execution: 'I have eight hundred shi of wheat and I am willing to redeem my life.' Huang shouted: 'I don't want your wheat, I only want your life.' So he beheaded him, and the price of wheat remained the same."</p>
<p>Also, the History of the Five Dynasties records the story of Zhang Guaiya: "Zhang Guaiya was the magistrate of Chongyang. A clerk came out of the treasury, and he saw a coin under his temple. He questioned him, and it was the money in the treasury. Guaiya ordered him to be beaten with a stick. The clerk was furious and said: 'One coin is not worth mentioning, why are you beating me! You can beat me, but you can't kill me!' Guaiya raised his pen and judged: 'One coin a day, a thousand coins in a thousand days. A rope saws through wood, water drips and wears through stone.' So he drew his sword, stepped down the stairs, and beheaded him.</p>
<p>Now there are fly tigers, also entering cages, slaying tigers and eradicating flies, let us watch the chivalry.</p>

<h3>Talking About Crickets Again</h3>
<p>Time flies quickly, White Dew has just passed, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is over. It is the season for fighting crickets. Humans capture and raise crickets, drive them to fight and bite each other, and kill each other, and then take it as a laughing stock or use it as a gambling tool. For crickets, which have a warrior-like posture and spirit, their fate is truly sad. Some say that the fighting spirit of crickets is their innate nature, the so-called "inheriting the qi of heaven and earth and responding to robbery", so they have to kill each other, and the entanglement never ends. This statement is a bit mysterious. A more scientific explanation is that crickets fight in order to compete for the opposite sex. Initially, when male and female crickets are in the same cave and other male crickets invade, the male cricket in the cave will fight at all costs. Over time, it becomes a habit, and whenever two males meet, they will have a contest. It is said that crickets are particularly brave after mating. Players have the saying "Store females before raising generals". According to this statement, crickets are like humans, and many are victims of love.</p>
<p>Three markets</p>
<p>Regardless of the real reason for the crickets' fighting spirit, due to the performance of this fighting fact, crickets have become playthings for adults and children. Shanghai, as a big city, does not produce crickets itself, but every year at this season, many foreign gangs purchase a large number of crickets from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jiangbei and other places and transport them to Shanghai. In the suburbs such as Longhua and Pudong, some people also specialize in catching crickets at night and bring them to Shanghai to sell in the morning. These days, the cricket markets near the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road, the Yimiao Market on Lianyun Road, and the City God Temple in Nanshi have once again seen the annual boom. In addition to small shops specializing in insects, fish, flowers, and birds being the main camps for crickets, there are also countless small stalls with simple equipment, a soap box with a dozen or twenty large and small earthenware pots on it, and a pile of bamboo tubes on the ground. Depending on the quality of their breed, some crickets are pampered and stroll in earthenware pots, while others are cramped and confined in bamboo tubes. The worst are those kept in a bamboo basket with a handful of withered grass in the middle. Hundreds of crickets live together in this dilapidated house, and they have to crawl on the walls.</p>
<p>Price per head</p>
<p>The endless stream of people buying and watching crickets has created an unprecedented bustle in these three markets. Every stall is crowded with dark crowds. Ordinary crickets in bamboo baskets or bamboo tubes sell for 50,000 or 100,000 yuan each, while "falling pot goods" in earthenware pots do not have a fixed standard. The stall owners bargain from a few cents or a few yuan to ten yuan or even twenty or thirty yuan in gold yuan notes. This depends on the strength of the cricket itself and whether the buyer is a connoisseur.</p>
<p>Eight-character secret</p>
<p>According to connoisseurs, the quality of crickets is truly complex and can be written into a thick book. Simply put: The head of a cricket should not be shallow and flat, the face should be square, and the color should be black like the bottom of a pot. The opening of the teeth and pliers should not be too large, only a line is appropriate. The neck should be wide, the legs should be thick, round, and long, and the tibias should be old in color, such as mottled white and waxy yellow. The wings should be short, thin, and have many wrinkles. The body should have delicate skin, pure color, broad back, and thick flesh. The color should be green first, yellow second, red second, black again, and white as the lowest grade. It is extremely rare to combine purple and yellow, so those with purple and yellow and an oily color are rare treasures among crickets. In addition, there is also the so-called eight-character secret of "dry, old, fine, glutinous, high, square, smooth, and thick", but this kind of identification method is easy to explain in words, but in application, without many years of experience, it is just "paper talk" and is still useless.</p>
<p>Difficult to Reproduce the Grand Occasion</p>
<p>It is said that the custom of fighting crickets originated in the Song and Ming dynasties. It first prevailed in the palace and gradually spread among the people. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai had public cricket gambling arenas, and a single win or loss often amounted to hundreds of yuan. These places that indulge in playing with things and lose one's ambition are now prohibited. Although private cricket fighting meetings are still often held, the grand occasion is difficult to reproduce after all, and today is not what it used to be. Sincerely, Wen Zhong</p>
