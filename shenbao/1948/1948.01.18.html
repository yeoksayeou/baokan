<h3>貝祖詒等飛抵華府　將晤馬歇爾高援華計劃　貸款總額傳在五億以上</h3>
<p>（聯合社華盛頓十六日電）中國技術代表團貝祖詒等一行三人，十六日飛抵此間，協助美國政府最後決定援華新計劃。中國駐美大使顧維鈞與國務院中國司長林筆特等均到機塲歡迎，其餘團員二人早在筆府。國務卿馬歇爾已向該團保證，將與會商中國目前經濟局勢及中國政府所採取之各種措施。同時，官方並稱：援華新法案可在月底以前提交國會討論，外傳政府在國會未表明其對援歐計劃之態度以前，不致提出一說，毫無根據。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕貝祖詒稱：渠不願向報界詳述其來美之旅行。代表團將在沙合漢旅館中設立辦事處。　〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕美國援華款額迄未公布。靈通方面稱：國務部所考慮中援華總數，在五億元以上，但「無疑地」將予以整理後再提交國會。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十六日合衆電〕前美國駐華外交人員，現爲有名之對華出口商享特氏，頃呼籲速即貸款六億元與中國，以爲其工業化之用。並謂：此項援助，應爲軍事援華及援助其改革幣制等全盤援助計劃之一部份，全部費用定爲十五億亦不爲多，兩年內以六億元貸款援華，可使中國渡過目前危機。渠並概述其計劃分爲六大項：　恢復粵漢路，　恢復華南工廠，　使華南灌溉方式近代化，並供給近代設備。　改進化學肥料計劃。　供給船隻，使其恢復中國內河及沿海之航運。　羊毛貸款及三百萬元之菸葉貸款。享氏並謂：美國大可不必等待國會之行動，而依法經由美國戰時財產處理局援華，中國聲請二千二百萬元信用貸款，俾向戰時財產管理局購買剩餘物資，目前仍未見實行，渠頗爲不解。並稱：中國在其豫算上需要援助，實因困於戰爭，美國如此種情况下亦難望收支平衡，更何能苛求於中國。至論乃共產黨時，享特謂：蔣主席於可以消滅共黨時並未消滅。按享特係於上海午餐俱樂部對兩百餘會員發表演說，本文僅其內容之一部。</p>
<h3>美今春出售油額　我配得六十萬桶　出售剩餘鐵砂美認我處置合法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕美商務部十六日所公布之一九四八年第一季石油產物配額表中，中國分配得六萬桶航空用汽油，三卞五萬桶其他汽油，十一萬桶火油，十萬桶柴油及無渣柴油。出口總配額係一千四百四十七萬桶，由美商務部之國際貿易局逐一國家分配，菲律賓配得汽油二萬桶，其他種類之油十三萬桶，火汕七萬桶，柴油及無渣柴油十六萬桶，日本及琉球未分配飛機用汽油，但獲得他種汽油四六萬桶，火油五萬桶，柴油三十七萬五干桶。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕夫國務郃官員稱：此間迄今獲悉，中國將其自太平洋島上所獲得美軍剩餘物資中之鐵砂轉售與伯里恒　廠乃屬合法者，據稱：內國可自山選擇其處置此項錢砂之方法，為中國缺少鋼廠以消耗大量鐵砂，故中國出售鐵砂極合邏輯也。彼等指出，居間人須負担運輸費用及運送之責任，職是之故，很等應享有利潤。</p>
<p>白宮去年秋撤消中國及其他國家不准將合同中之貨物轉售給美國之命令，乃因美國需　甚股，亟願購回。</p>
<h3>賴謨林巴　辯論援華問題</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處實列　爾　亞十六日電〕遠東專家賴迪謨與林巴格博士二人，一月十日在此問外交政策協會會議中，辯論美國援華問題。據費城詢問起記載：賴迪謨認爲運往中國政府之軍事配備將遭損失，或落入「他人手中」。染並反對財政上之援助，所持理由爲中國官員在美國銀行內均有大批私人存款。</p>
<p>林巴格教授稱：「美國援華，以支持中國政府面所化之每一美兀，均能完成巨大之利益。中國政府爲全體列强包括蘇聯所承認之政府，支持此一政府，乃出於常識及健全戰略之指示。美國援華如出以技術上之協助，則其功效最大。援助之支出情形，務使華美雙方當局均感滿意。此種援助在亞洲之決定性，不下於馬歇　計劃在歐所能發揮之效力」。</p>
<p>賴迪謨稱：「欲思以大砲或金錢支持目前之中國政府，作爲制正蘇聯之手段，此種政策，非但無效，而且有害。今日在中國，一種甚簡單而有力之民族主義，較之觀念，更為重要。自一九一一中國革命以來，中國人一直感覺外國之勢力與思想爲對中國獨立最惡劣之威脅。」</p>
<h3>美國救濟糧食　十二萬五千噸　三個月內運華</h3>
<p>麵粉八千噸今到滬　〔本報訊〕據行政院美國救濟物資處理委員會上海辦事處主任陳廣沅昨吿記者稱。美國救濟中國之糧食十二萬五千噸，在三個月之內即可全部運抵此間，且除食米七萬五千噸，麵粉與小麥五萬噸之外，尙有救濟中國之醫　物資價値美金五百萬元，及一部份布疋，均將於不久陸續運滬。</p>
<p>陳氏復稱：第三批麵粉八千噸，由加利福尼亞輪運米，本定十六日運滬，茲因途中躭擱，將延至今日始可到達，該處定明日下午三時在招商局第一碼頭該輪上舉行歡迎儀式，特請吳市長致歡迎詞，並攝取照片及活動電影，準備寄往美國，以示我國歡迎此項物資之熟誠。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕日本賠償物資督運委員會，十七日假招商局六樓舉行例會，議決要案二起：　日本賠償物資運抵上海後，其接送等駁運工作由交通部材料儲運總處統一辦理；　民營輪公司派赴日本載運賠償物資之船隻，原定本月二十日啓椗赴仙台裝運，茲因仙台方面不及準備，決議延遲至下月十日由滬啓椗。</p>
<h3>日賠償機器運用　內遷廠要求優惠</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕日本賠償我國之物資中，先期拆遷之第一批工作母機九千餘部，四分之三將分配與各國營事業機關，其餘四分之一約二千餘部，則配售民營。「遷川桂工廠聯合會上海辦事處，」前曾推舉代表胡厥文·顏耀秋·胡越中等晋京向中樞建議，要求將該項賠償機器二千餘部，先行撥充賠償內遷工廠損失之用，有餘再供內遷工廠租用或價購。該會幷於十七日下午四時，在南京路慈淑大樓四樓星五叙餐會招待新聞界，報告晋京建議經過，並陳述目前能度。據稱：「內遷工廠參加抗戰，有功國家，勝利後處境艱苦，對先期拆遷之賠償物資，自有要求先期賠償之權利，俟將來和會賠償數額確定，再行淸算。此次各代表晋京建議時，有關各部會首長雖深表同情，惟與內遷工廠之要朮，距離仍遠，希望輿論界主持公道，籲請政府接受內遷工廠之客觀要求」。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　論九龍城事件</h3>
<p>— 周酉村</p>
<p>一·九龍城事件的擴大。</p>
<p>緬甸的英國國旗方於本月四日正式下降，表現出了戰後英國遠東政策已漸　合理，使人至感欣愉，不料五日受英國政府指揮之港九警察，竟武裝進入九龍城，强拆中國居民之房屋，逮捕現任九龍城居民協會主席之居民代表朱沛　及劉毅夫二君。中國政府雖表示此一問題希望能循合法途經解決，香港當局却仍是一意孤行，並於十二日晨悍然派遣全副武裝之英警，向我手無寸鐵之居民開槍射擊，及投擲催淚彈，使八人受傷。九龍城事件在這樣情况下便擴大了，爲任何一個中國人所不能緘默。</p>
<p>九龍城事件，簡直可說是中國廢除不平等條約以來第一次遇到的恥辱！我們決不是感情衝動，而要故意加以渲染，以傷害第二一次大戰以來即在不斷增進着的中英友誼和邦交，却也不能不對港政府此種不合法的行爲，表示極大的憤慨，同時也爲港政府此一不聰明，不人這，妨害中英關係進展的行爲，感到非常的惋惜！</p>
<p>香港政府的當局，雖習慣於帝國主義對待殖民地的作風，但似乎也應知道，中英兩大民族，在第二次大戰時曾並肩作戰，共同抵抗日本的侵略。况且英國因看到中國的重道義，愛和平，於一九四三年一月十一日首先廢除中英間的不平等條約，隨後兩國使節的往返，更見漸進其友好關係；去年英國議會訪華團蒞華，亦曾看出了中國是在怎樣地獲得英國的眞正友情，以加强彼此間的貿易，使英國商業不致退出遠東市塲。不幸香港九龍問題，竟成爲中英增進邦交的一大障礙。</p>
<p>中英兩國正竭力謀取增進邦交之時，香港政府僅以　九龍城內居民齷齪不堪，不講衛生，一旦發生疾病，將傳染城外居民；　九龍城內民房拆除後，將修築公園一處，而公園之修築，對原有中國居民的健康亦甚有益；　依照國際公法，政府可曉諭居民講求衛生等三項「理由」，而以武力拆毀中國居民房屋，使之遭受傷害與損失，這眞是國際關係史上之一大奇蹟。吾人對這種舊創未復後的新痛，當決不能視若　　。</p>
<p>二·九龍城的主權誰屬？</p>
<p>一個城市裏的居民，本來是應該講求衛生；但講求衛生是一個問題，　　友邦的主　又是一個問題，兩者之間不能沒有分際。依照一八六〇年所締結的中英條約，中國僅允租借九龍作為香港的屏障，九龍城舊址及龍津大通，仍爲中國領土，一切行政權皆屬中國，由廣東省之寳安縣治理。</p>
<p>我們爲了要充分明瞭九龍的治權究竟屬於中國抑或屬於英國，再更進一步地追索一些以往的歷史吧。</p>
<p>雅片戰爭被英國打進了中國的大門後，一八四二年八月二十九日的南京條約將香港割讓與大英帝國後，英國以對佔領地區素來是兩點制，乃爲了保衛香港，又企圖在一衣帶水的中國本土對岸，佔上一個地方，香港北岸對時的九龍半島，便成爲了第二個目標。一八六〇年九月十一日的北京條約中，她果然復從中國割得的一七〇〇方哩之九龍司地方，一八九八年(即光緒二十四年）六月九日中英簽訂展拓香港界址專約，又使九龍半爲的全部被英國租借九十九年，北緯二十二度九分以北，東經一一三度，五十二度至一一四度三十分以內的島嶼，及大鵬灣，深州灣與香港四週海面都包括在內。該約對今日成爲問題之九龍城問題，却規定了：「所有九龍城內駐紥的中國官員，仍可在城內各司其事，惟不得與保衞香港之武備有所妨碍，其餘新租之地專　英國管轄，至九龍向通新安（即實安）陸路，中國官民照常行走，仍留附近九龍城原舊碼頭一區。以便中國兵商各船渡艇任便往來停泊，且使城內官吏任便行走」，幷曾說明：「議定在所展界內，不可將居民迫令遷移。」這已不啻說明英國承認了九龍城內的治權完全歸於中國，否則，中國官員當不能在城內各司其事，中國軍商各輪也不能任便停泊。這也就說明了港警此次拆毀九龍中國居民房屋之這法違約。因爲旣規定了「不可將居民迫令遷出」，而今竟將居民房屋拆毀，使其無立身之地，那就更不知從何說起了！</p>
<p>三·英國不能動搖中國九龍城　條約上存在的權益。</p>
<p>儘管英人於一八九九年四月十七日正式接收　界，　錦田村民衆　閉村閘抗拒，使英人藉口中國官員協助不力，而於五月十六日則將九龍的中國官員全部逐出，從　時起使中國政府實際上沒有能在九龍行使治權，但　當動搖不了中國在條約上所存在的權益。</p>
<p>中國官更被遂離九龍　城時，城內居民僅有五十餘戶，男女居民約一千人，英國人對之從未有所表示，興其他新界情形完全兩樣，由此可見英國人在那裏的治權亦不敢自已貿然礦認。然而，漸漸地，香港政府却對此注憲起來，而於一九三三年六月，藉口城內盡是貧民窟，地方不潔，有碍衛生，用補償產價辦法，通知城內居民遷往飛機塲附近之狗　嶺居住，城中居民以不願接受此種不法要求，乃未如命辦理。次年香港政府又重提舊案，終因居民不願搬遷，當它再進行迫遷時，居民中便推出代表向中國政府請願，而由外交部兩廣特派員甘介侯依約向香港政府提出抗議，使此事終成　案。到一九四〇年港政府第三次借口　權人要求强硬執行，將城內居民房屋拆卸，其時以中國正從事反侵略戰爭，未暇顧及或向英政府嚴重抗議，香港政府乃得偷偷地達成了任務。但很快居民又搭上了木屋，港政府也沒有辦法，能摧毀中國人這種不屈的民族精神。</p>
<p>不料英國於同意取消在華治外法權，交還租界，並根據平等互惠的原則以修改條約後，英國殖民地政府的帝國主義姿態，仍是始終不脫，雷厲風行地又於去年十一月二十七日，頒佈驅逐令，欲將九龍城二千左右的中國居民自現有的木屋中撤出，並以十二月十日爲限期。當時香港政府發言人曾稱：「如彼等不撤出，港政府將勒令速移」。九龍居民協會代表於十二月六日之記者招待會中，却表示了拒絕自該區撤退的堅決立塲，並謂：「即使冒流血之險，亦所不惜」。外交部駐兩廣特派員郭德華，當預料到此一問題之可能發展，乃與港政府進行交涉，以不獲結果，祇得飛京請命。可惜外交部其時忙於他事，對此却沒有積極的行動，香港政府以爲又是有機可乘，乃更不顧法理與事實，而終至釀成不幸的流血慘案。</p>
<p>四·九龍城應速歸　中門！</p>
<p>察　一月十二日進入九龍城，　傷中門居民之後，中國政府接　吿，　外長始　於當日　　召英國大使施　文至外交部，　　要求倫敦政府，立即訓令　港　督，在此交涉期問，對九龍城終止一切交涉行動，並不再派遣警察進入該城，對於中國政府八日所提關於香港政府强追拆遷九龍城居民房屋事，英國政府務須重視中英兩國及其人民間議具之友好關係，中止香港　績採取此項措施等各項書面要求，王外長亦一併請其　促英方接受。但十三日之九龍城內，仍爲武裝警察駐守，監視居民不許再行建築，英國之如此在中國主權所在境內橫行無忌，實爲一種可恥的侵略行爲。</p>
<p>英國政府應該知道，任何帝國主義時代侵略者的面日，在今日已經不能存在了，而大英帝國殖民政策，成敗如何，反應如何，具有政治眼光的英國紳士，尤其工黨領袖們，想必應有一正　的認識。如再以對付殖民地　已失敗的手段來對付中國這一個真實的友邦，為大英帝國的前途預想，願然太不適當。</p>
<p>英國特別應當知道的就是，中英間之不平等條約旣經廢除，在原則上，九龍香港都應歸還中國·因根據美·英諾言及大西洋憲章，中國收回旅順，大通，合灣，法國亦以廣州灣璧還，故港·九·澳門等地之歸還，自亦不可例外，九龍租借地一區，尤應首先交還，以符合大西洋　章精神。</p>
<p>英國自工黨執政以來，已一改以往的帝國主義政策，對其殖民地如印緬者已先後放棄其統治權准予獨立，且此次大戰之後，英國未來之戰略部碧已大爲改觀，在原子彈之威脅下對於彈丸般的香港與九龍，巳失掉軍事上之重要性，但英國如編續佔領，則實表親世界政治尙未能納入正動。</p>
<p>但吾人當知：今日旣非鴨片戰爭時期，也非義和　時期。今日於中國交往的友邦決不能再用帝國主義的猙獰面目對待中國；今日之中國人民也決不常如過去那樣閉門自守，或甚至一味排外。我們希望香港政府不要繼續其不智舉動，而使中英邦交受到損害；同時，我們也希望中國人民憑其理智，督促政府改變其軟弱態度，據理力爭，但切不可恃其　衆之暴力，有越軌的行動，如廣州十六日焚燬英領館之類，以增加中英兩國之隔閡。不然，則不僅中英邦交，即整個世界亦將蒙受到極大影響。</p>

<h3>孫科吳鐵城等　對沙面案談話　拆屋與騷動同爲憾事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕對於九龍城問題之看法，孫科副主席表示，渠相信循外交途徑決可獲得解決。但廣州事件實爲節外生枝，殊堪遺德。又國大籌委會秘書　洪蘭友稱：當前因九龍城問題所引起之學生遊行運動，不能謂爲不當，惟決不能發生排外之意外變化。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕國民黨中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城對記者談稱：「此次廣州沙面英領館被焚，與九龍城居民房屋被迫拆遷，以致被港　擊傷，同爲不幸事件。港府藉口公共衞生與防火患等問題，乃至事前未作妥善安頓，遽爾强迫居民拆屋遷移，實屬深可遺憾之事。至於廣州民衆示威遊行因暴徒混入，以至愛國行動變爲越軌行爲，亦足惋惜。」</p>
<h3>英民部聲明　爲九龍城案辯護</h3>
<p>〔路　社倫敦十七日電〕英殖民部十七日發表聲明，就九龍城勒遷事件有所釋明。據云，港當局之勒令九龍城居民遷移，係　相信該處具有火災及衛生方面的公共危險，而於執行遷令前已給予當地居戶以適當的警吿，並曾向居戶建議　居之處所。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕英國新聞處長麥克芳萊昨日接見記者稱：「本市英僑對沙面事件，均表示驚愕，惟在主使人查明之前，暫不表示意見。焚燬領事館之舉，性質甚爲嚴重，中英友邦之間，發生此不幸事件，至堪惋惜」。記者吿以九龍拆屋之事，爲沙面事件發生之主因，我外部已發表談話，以英政府未加過問爲憾。麥氏答稱：「九龍拆屋之舉，倫敦政府認爲在香港政府治權之內，中國政府旣未就此事向英政府提出交涉，倫敦政府自不致加以過問。記者復詢以凱倫勛　之東來，是否爲斡旋此事，麥氏認爲此僅爲外界之推測，惟勛　　一幹練之外交家，且素對中國同情，可能自動調停此事。惟渠此次來華，完全爲私人遊歷性質，並無代表身份，故僅能在與中國政府人員談話中，貢獻其意見。勛爵已謁見蔣主席，並曾拜會張院長，談話中必然提及九龍城問題。目前一切交涉，均在南京進行，貴國外交部已表示願和好協議，想不久即可獲得解決。」記者往訪時，適字林西報編輯亦在座，渠等對本市學生游行一節，均極表關切，昨日外灘之英國機關均因此縮短辦公時間。</p>

<h3>孫副主度演講　憲政興憲法　闡擇憲法各重耍章則</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國府孫副主席科十七日下午二時應政洽犬學之邀，向該校學生講演「憲政與憲法」。孫氏演講達一小時半，其內容自說明中華民國憲法與五五憲草之制訂之精神，旋就憲法各電要章則，與英美蘇各國憲法加以比較，其要點有　選舉，　關於中央政府部份，　地方政府部份，　大選之提名問題，　省縣自治等。孫氏分析現行憲法與五五　草之相異點稱：現行憲法係以五五憲草爲藍本，而有新的變更，因五五憲草乃適用於一黨政治之國家，而我國已由一黨政治脫胎爲多黨政治，因而就五五憲草修訂而為現行憲法。關於選舉方式，孫氏稱：國大之任務，除選舉總統外，尙有修改憲法之權，且爲有任期者，在此任期內，如總統執政有不能使人民滿意者，即可召開罷免總統大會，施行其罷免權，而美國則非是，美之選舉，首先全國投票選舉「總統選舉人」，此選舉八待總統選出後，任務即行完畢，美因採議會政治，故對憲法之修改甚爲困難，凡國會提出一修正案復，必須由各州投票決定，故遇有疑難處，時常經十餘年而不獲解決，我國則甚易，因每年舉行國大，均有修改憲法之機會。又關於中央政府部份，五院之職權以立院爲國家最高立法機構，有權控制政院，因行政院長係由總統提名，經立院同意後始可任命者，此種立法係相等於英法責任內閣之制度。又憲法第五十五條中，規定政院對立院之負責部份，政府施政方針必須立院通過，方能施行，但與英法又有不同者，即英法議會可採取不信任投粟，以倒內閣，而政有則有解散議會之權，我國政府則無解散權，不能向總統要求解散議會，此點即在加强立院之　，而爲一極新頴之制度，將米如施行時，必須有一條件，即立院內有一絕對多數之黨，足以支持同黨主特之政院，則即可不致隨時發生政潮及倒閣運動。其次爲我監察院之地位，相等於他國之上院，但無上院之權，因監院僅有同意權，美如若改組政府，上院同意後即可，我國改組政府之權則屬立院。其次爲司法院，我司法院增設大法官制度，有解釋法律權。孫氏說明目前憲法之施行情形稱：選舉部份已實行，立院俟立委選出後，即可組成，監院亦同，行政·司法·考試三院，則待總統選出後組成。關於省縣自治者，中央政府與地方政府係採均權制，將來自縣長至省長及省市議會均採民選，由下而上，凡此均爲改革之處。關於政黨提名候選人問題，孫氏稱：此係援各國先例，且各國除政黨可提名外，無政黨資格者即無法參與競選，我國係初次辦理，尙能給與無黨派人士以簽署提名之機會，惟此次國代選舉，曾引起若干糾紛，實爲首次辦理缺乏經騐之故。孫氏末稱：關於省縣自治通則，政府頃正慎重烈攷　中，尙未決定。</p>

<h3>共黨國利用罷工為武器　反抗馬歇爾計畫　英外部發表「M密令」內容</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕英外交都頃發表所謂「M密令」，其中包括德國共黨在魯爾區組織罷工及破壞運輸制度之秘密計劃。外部發言人並曰，根據續獲情報，英外部益信該密令之眞實性。密令有謂，今冬將爲德勞工歷史的決定性時期，繼續戰鬥，並與歐洲各地勞工階級聯絡，可以征服生產關鍵地位，此一戰役乃爲爭取解放世界無產階級最後奮鬥的出發點，獲得最後勝利的先決條件。爲維持同志的紀律，並利用無產階級的一切武器，社會主義的故鄉蘇聯將支持此一戰役，盡力反抗資本主義的獨佔。貝爾格勒之共產情報局將聯絡歐洲各社會主義運動的共同戰役，德共雖尙非該局之一員，但將在下一戰役中取得主要地位。各國勞工階級將供給必要援助，德共任務在利用此一援助，以獲致最佳結果。冬季戰役之主要目標，在擊破獨佔資本主義經由所謂馬歇爾方案的進攻。</p>
<h3>決議包含五部分　以魯爾區域為奮門中心　本年三月起組織總罷工</h3>
<p>同志等經縝密思考後，已成立下列決議：</p>
<p>「第一部」：民衆奮鬥之中心，為　爾區及其生產，以及西德北德之運輸制度，基於技術原因，負責同志在爆發的罷工中，不可處在第一錢，但爲符合「R計劃」起見，工人之罷工應在運輸及生產機關中同時發動，運輸工會及金屬工會將相繼罷工，但共黨須避免直接參加。就過去經騐觀，魯爾工人享有優於其他工人之特權故或將拒絕罷工。此時運輸工人應負起重大的任務，不萊梅—杜塞爾　夫鐵路及漢堡—比爾費鐵路尤爲重要。運輸工人的罷工中心爲陶特蒙，在埃森之罷工不可過於引人注目，否則將牽動整個計劃。可靠報吿謂軍事當局已有運輸後備工人的準備，以便於運輸工潮發動時出動，因此吾人必須斥堠各重要路綫，盡力阻止運輸的順利進展。吾人目的不在完全阻斷糧運，而在延遲其抵達目的地。糧運遲延及生產工業之罷工，爲我計劃之主要部份。同志勞埃，貝勒堡，西格蒙及克拉條斯基已各在先行佈置的地位，其他西德罷工亦應適用同一原則，即團結全體勞工階級。</p>
<p>「第二部」：自組織觀點而論，車心在於金屬工會，於此不可忽略者，乃爲取得或至少控制工會之各資產。勞工階級之團結必須立即完成，特別任務在覓取組織中之弱點而加以利用。同志霍尼柴·特拉勃·加勃洛夫斯基·呂維許·克勞生漢及克羅已獲有執委會之權力，策動魯爾區之戰役。</p>
<p>「第三部」宣傳工作應由中央執委會統一指揮，其目標如下：　馬歇爾計劃乃美國獨佔資本家的奴役計劃；　各獨佔資本主義國家之罷工，乃資本主義社會加緊敗壞的象徵；　東歐經濟狂蘇聯領導下有積極的進展，於此吾人應計及西德共黨機關報之被禁，因此吾人應利用電台及郵遞網，以確保宣傳品之流通。暴動幹部第七第十一第十四號負責宜揚魯爾區公民投票及企業公營之意義，勞工階級之團結，可經由公民投票之宣傳而促進。</p>
<p>「第四部」時間表：　在十二月底以前完成社會民主黨及共黨之共同基礎，以實現公民投票；　在二月前完成罷工幹部之組織；　自三月初起組織總罷工。</p>
<p>「第五部」督導工作，由MA幹部負責，各同志應恪遵幹部之命令。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾計畫　或可提早通過　美參院民主黨領袖宣稱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：華感頓訊，參院民主黨領袖巴克萊預料參院將於三月一日通過馬歇爾計劃，較杜魯門總統所定限期尙早一個月。參議員肯脫基預料共和黨方面不致將建議中之六十八億美元予以削减，惟參議員塔虎脫則主張削减二十六億美元。</p>
<h3>美對受援國家　應有查賬權力　范登堡談馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕美參議負范登堡十六日稱：如美國對各借債國家，要求並獲得檢查其賬簿之權，則對馬歇爾計劃之一半批評，可以免去。渠同意國際銀佇長麥克勞之意見，認爲對歐洲十六國之貸款，應爲生產貸款而非可能永不歸還之空洞貸款</p>
<h3>英法經濟會談　預定昨日結束　末次會後將發表公報</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕法大使館發言人稱，法財長梅逸與英財長克里浦斯在此進行之英法經濟財政談判，將於十七日結束，公報可望於末次會議後發表。此次談判幾無間歇，惟議程迄尙未有　　，然財政界人士相信法郎貶値問題必爲議題之一。英負責人士且信兩國在馬歇爾方案下更密切的經濟合作，尤其是關於英煤斤之對法輸出，亦曾經兩財長審查。</p>
<h3>美機動艦隊　出發訪遠東</h3>
<p>〔聯合社珍珠港十六日電〕美國海軍第卅八機動艦隊，中有航空母艦「福爾吉」號，驅逐艦四艘，油船一艘，今日開出，訪問雪梨·香港·靑島·橫須賀與關島。</p>
<h3>美以援歐換取基地　馬歇爾堅決反對　因此舉徒足增加蘇聯宣傳力量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：華盛頓訊，外傳美國將要求歐洲國家借予根據地，作爲實施馬歇爾計劃之交換條件，今日馬歇爾已予否認。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕權威方面稱，馬歇爾國務　堅決反對國會以歐洲國家供給美國以軍事基地，作爲美國給予援助之條件。渠認此舉將損及援歐復興計劃之目標，可能使歐洲國家不敢接受援助，更足增加蘇聯宣傳之力量。猶憶自戰爭結束以來，在每次之援外方案辯論中，均曾引起以美國獲取軍事基地作爲交換之可能性，類此之修正案，結果莫不均遭否決，料此次亦不致成爲對援歐方案之嚴重阻礙。</p>
<h3>魯爾區十五萬德工人　罷工一日已結束　聲明動機為了饑餓興政治無關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：魯爾訊，魯爾區德工人十五萬人以上，於今晨六時恢復工作，二十四小時之罷工，於焉結束。英國治安當局認爲十日來魯爾區第一次獲得寗靜，並無罷工在進行中，亦無計劃中之罷工將吿發生。惟英美官員仍認爲工業上尙不能保持長久之平寗。</p>
<p>此間工聯會主席山特斯表示，必要時將再罷工，並使礦工加入。渠否認此次罷工爲共黨破壞計劃之一部份，聲明罷工動機純粹爲了飢餓，與政治無關。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十六日電〕德境美軍總司令克萊中將稱：反對西方强國之陰謀，將可證明爲共黨摧毀馬歇爾計劃及德西部佔領區合併之企圖。盟國當局正在　密注意此項罷工（表面上由於糧食缺乏）與共　陰謀計劃有關之任何迹象。克萊中將又稱，共黨在德境英美佔領區中之陰謀業已開始，但渠並未說明十六日魯爾區罷工與共產陰謀間有任何關係。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十六日電〕英陸長辛威爾視察魯爾抵此，今日招待記者稱，英佔領軍對於德國各地發生之不安局勢未能忽視。記者問是否曾與英軍司令商討派遺軍隊應付魯爾區總罷工風潮，辛氏即以上項意見間接答覆，惟對於有關魯爾區與柏林英軍態度之各種問題，進免直接作答，並一再聲明對於魯爾工潮及柏林蘇官方報紙所載英美法三國佔領軍將退出柏林等說，一概不知。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：華盛頓訊，據美方透露，蘇聯如能將其戰時自英美所借之軍艦歸還，則可自前義大利之艦隊中獲得軍艦七艘，以及其他一九四七年二月巴黎會議中所決定者，直至現在始予透露。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕印度聖雄甘地爲呼籲印回團結合作而絕食後，我考試院戴院長傳賢對甘地之健康，極爲關懷，昨日特電印總理尼赫魯請代致慰問，並祝其願行成就。原電如下：</p>

<p>〔路透社新德里十七日電〕德里今日宣布爲例假日，停止各業活動，俾舉行公共祈禱會，爲甘地之生命祈禱。昨夜醫師之公報謂，甘地之一般狀况無甚變化，僅腎臟作用不甚正常，但渠猶在床側向擴音器以傲弱之言，向其祈禱會致辭，表示印度興巴基斯坦之間苟不獲和平，渠亦不願再活在人世。印度半島各地之印回錫克敎徒以及王公巨卿，分電或致函甘地寓所，請其中止絕食，醫師亦勸其復食。但甘地表示渠僅信賴天帝，須俟奉天帝命後始行終止絕食。德里郵局特製特別郵戳，上書「種族協調可救甘地」字樣，加蓋各種郵件之上。</p>
<h3>美運輸艦上簽訂協定　印荷頒發停戰令　並附有政治原則十八項</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚巴達維亞十七日電〕印尼共和國及荷蘭兩國政府代表十七日下午二時五十分在美國運輸艦「倫維爾」號上簽訂停戰協定，結束蔓延一年之爪哇戰爭。停戰將於格林威治時問一時半起生效。</p>

<p>停戰命令適用於沿境地區之雙方軍隊，荷印政府去年八月廿九日稱該區境界爲「范莫克綫」，今後則改稱「現狀錢」，停戰令並適用於協定特別標明之區域。附於停戰協定後者，尙有雙方同意今後協調之政治原則十八項，亦由調解委員會副署，雙方並允諾遵守起始之十二項原則，其餘六項係調解委員會之建議，故無作爲談判基礎之束縛力，十二項中有四項係採納去年三月廿五日荷印簽訂之林加蒂基本協議之內容。政治原則規定：　印尼人民之獨立；　印尼及荷蘭兩國人民相互合作；　由民主方式產生憲法，依此憲法成立聯邦性主權國；　印尼合衆國及荷蘭君主統治下之其他各部成立聯邦；　根據林加蒂協定之原則，由調解委員會協助成立並簽訂爪哇，蘇門答臘及馬都拉三島政治糾紛之解決方案：　簽訂政治協議時，應規定雙方軍隊之削减；　舉行公民投票由人民自行決定其地位；　聯合國可以隨時觀察情形，直至荷蘭政府將主權移交印尼合衆國爲止；　在主權移交印尼合衆國之前主權仍屬荷蘭政府；　荷蘭政府同時有權在將來印尼共和國所轄區域組織臨時聯邦政府。印荷代表團主席均發表演說，稱楊調解委員會之工作，會議桌置放於艙口，船上諸人成集中甲板觀禮。</p>
<h3>檢查德軍工廠　蘇聯表反對</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十六日電〕柏林四强聯絡委員會昨開會時，蘇聯代表拒絕同意英美之建議，由以檢查德國前軍工業爲任務之盟國檢查團，隨時自由檢查任何工廠。渠認撿查任務之成功，有賴於其檢查路綫之縝密企劃。昨日之會歷時甚久，議程經討論者猶不到一半，與過去之類似會議殊無軒輊。</p>
<h3>阿聯盟擬請印度　撤回對巴控案　巴代表發言冗長創紀錄</h3>
<p>〔聯合社開羅十七日電〕阿拉伯聯盟今日要求七個會員國，促請印度撤回其在聯合國安理會對於巴基斯坦之控訴。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十七日電〕巴基斯坦外長　弗魯拉昨在安理會就喀什米爾案之辯論中，不斷發言三小時又十分之久，超過蘇外次　辛斯基保持之發言時間紀錄達一小時。渠所述天意爲巴基斯坦認爲印度　負「以集體屠殺問敎徒爲其有組織計劃之一部」的責任。</p>
<h3>原子能管制　蘇重申立場</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十六日電〕聯合國原子能委員會工作委員會休會三日後，今日在此重開會議，研究蘇聯與該會多數會員國問意見之　點。蘇代表葛羅米柯聲明蘇聯繼續堅持在得以組織原子能之國　管制前，各國應簽訂公約，禁止持有及使用原子武器。蘇聯並認原子工廠毋庸由國際原子能管制機構經營，但準備接受由國際機構　週期性檢查的建　。</p>

<h3>左冀議員攻擊片山　擬迫日內閣垮台　社會黨大會將決定政府命運</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十七日電〕日本政界消息靈通人士十七日稱：爲期四日之日本社會民主黨全國代表大會於十九日題幕之結果，將決定片山內閣之命運，即使社民黨內之左翼份子能促使片山倒閣，彼等其後亦將向右轉而不向左轉。</p>
<p>社民黨十七日舉行第二日大會，出席者有來自全國各地代表七百人，左翼份子六人，大肆攻擊片山首相。彼等尖刻批評現政府對社會政策執行不力，並稱如謂十八月前因組織聯合政府而成立四黨政策協議致政府受協議之牽制，故耍求立即解散四黨聯合。社民黨中左翼份子約居其半，彼等採取雙管齊下之戰術：第一，奪取片山系之重要黨中地位；第二，强迫該黨廢棄四黨協議。消息靈通之政治觀察家以爲，第二項計劃如吿成功，片山內閣之基礎崩潰，內閣非垮台不可。若然，一般預測片山將決定突解散議會，舉行重選。由於社民黨左翼份子僅佔議會內該黨勢力之半，故選舉結果，保守派候選人必可以壓倒優勢出任新首相。左派企圖阻止片山之續任執行委員會主席，且擬以左派加藤代右派出任秘書長。</p>
<h3>日本托兒所　殺嬰不見血　以詐取牛奶食糖配給品</h3>

<h3>浙蓉中學慘殺案　鄧起容身受數十血刃　主犯張匯東在嚴鞫中　供詞中發現學生界大規模暗殺組織</h3>

<h3>蘇北綏靖新局面</h3>
<p>〔本報淮陰十二日訊〕隨着逝去的一串無情的歲月，蘇北綏靖工作在共匪的「避免主力作戰」的原則之下，又沉悶地度過了一九四七年。檢討過去一年的綏靖工作，誠然不曾有過一次轟轟烈烈的仗在蘇北打出來，可是，我們可以獲得一個結論，就是只要碰到了匪軍的主力，國軍都可以隨時打一個道地的勝仗，收穫　碩的戰果。八月份的蘇家咀之役，十月份的睢寗之役，十一月份的五里莊，錢家集之役，十二月份的泗陽以北的戰事，都是很好的例證。</p>
<p>尤其以去年聖誕節起到今年的新年，中間短短幾天，國軍的淸剿部隊，以</p>
<p>通榆綫上的偉大收穫，作為一份隆重的禮物，送給了蘇北的人民。這一度拓展今後蘇北綏靖局面的戰役經過是這樣的：國軍「天地人」師，由王師長親自率領十個國，由東台北進，實踐淮海綏區張雪中司令官厘訂的大規模淸剿計劃中的第一步。蘇北共匪的最高指揮官管文蔚，前於李堡一役之後，在他們的幹部會議中曾說：「李堡的仗，是小勝，將來還要打一個大勝仗給你們看。」於是他把不輕易拿出來用的第十一·十二兩個縱隊的全部主力，都放在伍祐到卞倉這一綫上。這是國軍的一個</p>
<p>絕好機會</p>
<p>無疑。一年來，剿匪的主力打，始終只遭遇一個國或一個旅，不曾能痛痛快快地剿他一下，這次他們把僅有的主力全部送上門來，這種機會眞太難得了。在匪方的想法，他們知道國軍在蘇北的實力是不太大的，如果把這一次淸剿的部隊全部解決，他們就可以長驅南下，直搗江南，而企圖有事於京滬了。</p>
<p>戰事從廿六日午後五時開始，以卞倉和柏家巷（伍祐南三華里）爲核心，展開猛烈的戰鬥。匪使用逐次攻擊法，每日增加三個團的兵；在廿六日戰事初起的時候匪的作戰部隊不過一萬人，到了廿七日加到兩萬多，廿八日就加到三萬餘人，廿九日，則把全部主力十六個團都拿出來使用，而戰事也達到最高潮。</p>
<p>張雪中司令官在鎭江開過了蘇北綏靖會議，廿八日午後就趕到淮陰，他從廿八日起，兩畫夜</p>
<p>沒有睡覺，一心一德地指揮前線的戰事。</p>
<p>在這個時間，爲貫澈一鼓殲匪的主力的決心，國軍又從東台開出一批勁旅，參加作戰，而大批空軍，也出動助戰。另外，從兩淮間出發的國軍，到達東溝益林，阜寗的守軍某旅，也開始南下，完成三面包圍的部署。</p>
<p>三晝夜的激戰結果，匪的精銳第卅二，卅五兩個旅，是被擊潰了，匪於傷亡一萬五千人之餘，乃於三十日午後，把潰不成軍的殘部，竄向老巢合德鎭而去。國軍於等待一個</p>
<p>新的部署完成之後，就要真搗他們的巢穴。</p>
<p>記者於日前在綏區的指揮部中，和張雲中司令官晤談，他坐在話報機的旁邊，於指揮畢務萬忙之際，帶着興奮的神情，向記者分析這一次戰役的前因後果，他說：這次匪的主力，損失在一半以上，以後蘇北綏靖工作的担于，要减輕多了。」</p>
<p>匪留在蘇北的主力部隊，實際上就僅有這十一，十二兩個縱隊，然而一年以來，他們始終以洗竄的方式來應付清剿的國軍，以致綏靖工作，終不能順利地達到理想中的地步。這次匪軍主力受了這樣一個大的打擊，無疑地是蘇北今後綏靖工作的一個轉捩點。</p>
<p>同時，綏靖工作另外的一個阻礙，就是軍政的不能切實配合。这一點，在兩月以前的</p>
<p>六省聯防會議中，有一個重要的決定，就是：綏區今後受省主席的監督，而綏靖區司令官對轄區內的專員縣長，有絕對的指揮之　，所以綏靖區司令官在名義上是低了，但在職權上却擴大了，並且因此可以進一步地加强軍政的配合。</p>
<p>在張雪中將軍主持之下的的淮海綏靖區，已經軍事最高當局決定擴大改組爲第七綏靖區，其轄區也擴展到隴海綫。新年起，經過一週間的緊張工作。</p>
<p>第七綏區</p>
<p>已經改組完成。並且決定幾天以後——十二日，將召開綏靖會議，在轄區內的專員縣畏，黨部書記長，參議會議長，以及部隊長自團長以上，部將來淮出席，共商蘇北綏靖大計。</p>
<p>一連串的新聞，吿訴了每個蘇北人，蘇北局面在短期內將有一個決定性的開展，千百萬嗎喁　治的民衆，都以一種無比的興奮心情，來迎接這一個新的局面！</p>

<h3>紗管紡織購銷實施細則　政院小組會審查中　複製商登記延期至明日截止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會主委袁良，昨日下午三時許，公　自京乘機飛滬。承龍記者·　次調京之代　代織統　統銷實施細則六種，萊田行政院提交小組會審查，約二三日可　　完畢，然　再公佈施行云。</p>
<p>關於原棉衣量不足，較小廠家將因原料不濟而停工一節，據悉花紗布管理委員會，已　許準備先以一部份棉花配與廠方，以花易紗，聞是項過渡辦法，待該會主委袁良返滬後，即可決定是否實行。</p>
<p>又訊：該會應各公會之請，已將紗布商及各複製廠商登記，延期至下星期一截止。</p>
<p>棉紗俏升</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以連日下跌甚鉅，初開客帮即來乘低吸納，本街亦稍進取，喊價由被轉堅。嗣後更聞棉紗統稅提高一成以上，人心尤俏。四十二支藍鳳細紗，中途冲出六千萬關，高達六千零二十萬元。斯時同業中厄於頭寸者，逢高即吐，行情復吿回挫。但至最後，較之上日，則吿回漲一百二十萬，爲五千九百五十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗價，回升五六十萬至一·二百萬不等。</p>
<p>細布上漲</p>
<p>棉布市况，晨開因銀根轉鬆，浮　抵補，新買活動，客路台灣漢口寗波等帮，稍有吸納，惟實力派依然逢高吐售。但結果以各方哄抬，十二磅各檔細布，比上日回漲自一·二萬至四五萬元，此外　嘰漂布直貢士林布等，亦均挺升一萬餘至十萬左右，其餘粗布斜紋等則升沉互見。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共售一四一六〇疋，申購單三五一張，內除廠商七張，購布二八〇疋外，於悉　布號所購。</p>
<p>棉市績疲</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，趨勢續疲，紡建開價過低，貨主不願輕售，未聞成交。同業因銀根奇緊，更以週六關係，下午人員不齊，故交易稀少。成交一二〇包，送廠價做開通州細絨四九六萬，棧交價靈　五一一萬一千，周浦籽花下水貨一〇六萬，跌七萬。</p>
<h3>中紡公司發表　十二月份產量</h3>
<p>紡建公司統計室，昨發表卅六年十二月份上海各紡織廠運轉及生產數字如下：日夜班計運轉紗錠四四·八六七·九五五枚，全日共產紗三六二九七件，較前月份增產百分之二·四。全月運轉布機七五八〇〇二台，計產布七七三七四七疋，較前月增產百分之一·二。</p>
<p>至增產原因，據該公司統計室負責人談稱：係爲自備發電機補充電力之故，本月份如無其他阻得，生產數字復可增加云。</p>
<p>生絲掉換人絲　農經財三部會擬實施辦法</p>
<p>關於生絲掉換人絲一事，蠶絲協導會頃奉農林部訓令：「案准全經會秘書處函，案查關於蠶絲出口掉換人絲一案，經該會審查討論，建議原則六項：（一）謀　絲之增產及改進計，繼續推行　絲產銷計劃，（二）以生絲出口所得之外　，　取人　配給各　　，（三）人　之　進及分配，由輸出入委員會監督，會同中信局辦理，（四）以人絲之盈餘，貼補生產成本，（五）除貼補生產成本尚有盈餘時，儘量撥充改進及獎勵　絲之費用，（六）配給之人絲，應規定一部份織外銷綢輸出，換取外匯。以上實施詳細辦法，由農經財三部擬定之，並已經全經會提出二十五次大會決議，照審查意見通過，令仰該會會同中蠶公司擬具詳細辦法呈部核示」聞該會奉命後，業已　令力理擬具中。</p>

<h3>一市五縣染織業　今日召開聯合會　針對國策力謀同業團結</h3>
<p>上海市及常州無錫常熟江陰吳縣等一市五縣染織業，共擁有織布機四萬餘台，占全國棉紗複製業生產骰備十分之八以上。近因花紗布管理委員會之進行統購統配，定於今日（十八）在本市集議應付方法。各地同業公會之主要負責人向本市染織工業同業公會報到者，已有六七十人，今日中午將假座閔行鎭文綺染織專科學校　　，下午六時在國際飯店聯歡敍餐。據其發言人談稱，巳往之配紗制度，未臻完善。各廠之被屏未與者，迄今仍不得不仰　於黑市紗。自紡建在市塲拋售，情勢略佳。終因紗廠生產不足，複製週轉爲難，目下各地同業之開工者，統扯不過半數，曠業失時，甚可惋惜。一市五縣所產之布，歷來爲供應全國之總匯，如任其脫節，各地需供更堪担心。此次會議中，將商討有效辦法，以上　政府云。其發言人又指稱，當局正在辦理複製廠登記，而限期迫促，同業有未及趕辦者，業巳由公會　陳理由，請予展期，如不得請，則此等被　於管制綫以外之廠商，將如何生存，頗成間題。聞從前紡建辦理登記，即以繳騐證件過繁，限期又太促，致事實上正在生產之工廠，趕辦不及，未得配紗者，往往有之云。</p>
<h3>食米市勢疲軟　油市一致回振</h3>

<p>麵粉晨開狂跌，午收見挺，結局軋跌萬餘元。麩皮　見猛挫一二萬元，臨收亦堅。</p>
<p>豆餅厦門動辦，鄉莊略動，回漲萬餘元。黃豆售心轉堅，消化略活，回升一二萬元。荼豆漸見甦象，明定暗堅，赤豆沉悶，　豆微升萬元。豇豆暫成定勢之格，紅糧到銷兩淡，價無上落。</p>
<p>苞米北洋重見猛納，疲而轉挺，飛漲六七萬元。芝蔴供求平衡，黑白蔴均少上落，惟奶蔴見挺二三萬元。生仁銷路尚可，回高三五萬元。</p>
<p>油市猛跌之後，店胃轉濃，乘巧納取，各油一致回振，豆油生油菜蔴油相繼上漲十餘萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧北運</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局其美輪，裝食米千餘噸，昨日運靑鳥，執信輪裝麵粉及雜貨二千三百噸，亦運靑島，黃興輪裝米二千噸，今日駛津。麟閣輪裝麵粉十六萬七千餘包，亦於今日運津。漢民輪裝食米麵粉計一千九百噸，定二十日運天津。又中一〇四號亦裝麵粉五百噸二十日運天津。</p>
<p>又訊：福來輸船公司代理之克利當尼亞號，自澳洲載麵粉十九萬包來滬，因天氣惡劣，行駛受阻，一再延期始行到滬。昨據該公司稱，今日定能進口，停泊公和祥碼頭，該項麵粉係交通部儲運局報裝。</p>
<h3>租賃所得稅　業主請收益課</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行信託房地產三業公會，前以代理經租部份代扣財產租貢所得稅後，各業主分別聲稱，近來物價高昂，一般房租每不能隨物價比例增漲，依於租買之利潤，限於實際支出之百分之十，業主所得極微。且因契約關係，在一定期間內，不得任意片面加租，甚至因而賠累者，比比皆是。若照所得額納稅，將使業主負担過重，殊失賦稅公平之原則。爰特聯銜呈請財部，請求按實際收益額課稅，並請解釋報繳計算標準。刻財部業已批示，略謂：查財產租貸所得稅，係以實際租賃所得爲課稅對象。其計算所得額時應减除之各項費用者，自應依照稅法規定辦理。該公會等當轉知所　會員，一體辦云。</p>
<p>肥皂上升</p>
<p>日用口肥皂市面，因　家派貨消息沉寂，　以連日下跌過钜，浮　粉粉抵　，　業　吸。結果固本箭刀兩皂較之上日回漲四五萬兀，黃祥茂亦軋升二萬五千元，其餘光華美麗　皂市氣挺秀。火柴老牌美麗鳳風軋升廿萬，雜牌依然疲軟。</p>
<p>茶市岑靜</p>
<p>內銷茶仍因本街與各帮之去化接踵，買氣異常濃郁，至於外銷茶，出口商　續袖手，市面依然岑靜，而價格則一致上漲。揆厥原因，執主鑒於市存枯涸，居奇扳抬之念變本加厲，迨至收市，遂各見軋升，惟若干種花色，以貨品關係，大都堅守原陣，形勢明平暗悄。</p>
<h3>統債上漲　外股挫落</h3>
<p>公債昨以我代表團抵達華府，幣制消息又起，漲風擴大，頻創新高峯。統丙自六萬元開後，漲到九萬四，而後退至八萬五左右徘徊。</p>
<p>較前收計甲乙升二千一，丙漲二千五，丁升二千元，戊好二千二，成交約六百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨以穗市有意外事件，人心又露焦灼，加上申電又升爲三元四，而吿疲軟。怡紗晨開五四萬五，低至五萬三而後略力穩，廣帮證券商股手，散戶稍納，較前收計怡紗紙版航業常車電話祥泰各跌半成，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>賣方一再介傾售　華股堅後步疲</h3>
<p>華股昨人心雖好，少壯派多頭乘高出籠，廣帮在港電再形放長聲中，一再傾售，銀根仍緊，堅後步疲。小型股一度俏利，後亦不支。</p>
<p>晨開時榮辱俱見，永紗以即交七五○元及遞交七八五元登塲，開後升爲七七〇元及八〇二元高價，小型股中三熱門又露生氣，新光所漲最速，但賣氣甚盛，息價開高至二角八分半及二角三分，港電報長三元四，美貸又起傳說，永紗遂漸步降至七一八元及七五二元低價，旋經拉上至七二八元及七六〇元，其後形勢徘徊，無甚特變，午收爲七二一元及七五六元。華新跌停後有回，絞前收即交股計中紡微升，火柴五和尚平，美亞跌一成，信和華　中法新華榮　統益中絲商務內衣同降半成，餘均微降。遞交股美亞跌一成，華　景福信和跌半成，勤興成交少，軋升半成。新光永紗微降。塲外各未上市股票，亦因銀根緊迫有賣少買。</p>
<h3>糖市交易停頓　受童忠記倒閉影響</h3>
<p>昨晨食糖市塲交易突吿停止。蓋自童忠記倒閉後，至今尚未了結。債權人方面召集緊急會議，一致認爲經紀人亦應負責。乃於會後報吿　局，傳訊經紀人數人。而經紀人方面，則以爲所得佣金極微（每袋七百元），不能負此重責。故於昨日起自動停止交易，以便等商妥善辦法。</p>
<h3>物價評議會　調整火油售價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕物價評議會燃料小組第十七次會議，決定調整火油價格爲每桶（五十三加倫）五百八十七萬元，每聽七十二萬元，另售每提一萬八千元，經吳主任委員核准，自本月十九日起實行</p>

<h3>歲暮感言</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>歲　腦　，父將過年了。</p>
<p>國歷新年方過去，不過在一般人心理上，過　　歷近年才是傎正的過年，這也許是積習難除，非短時間中可以變更過來；但是農歷新年確有許多類似宗敎式的儀　　　綴，使人不容易輕易忘懷。踏進了農歷十二月二十日之後，便有一連串的過年節日，像送灶，接灶，做糕餅，大掃險，喫年夜飯，到了大除夕這一天，更是緊張萬分，人人心理上似乎都有一種特殊的感覺，雖然大家明知道不過是這麼一回事，可是誰也不能免俗。然而正唯如此，才是表現了一個民族的風俗習慣的深刻力量。</p>
<p>國歷新年因缺少風俗傳統的背景，所以雖是國定假日，却很少緊張氣氛。記得在政府公佈實行國歷新年之初，首都的警察當局曾一度下令商人不得在農歷新年休業，結果仍在民情難　的考慮下收回了成命。如今農歷年雖仍居非正式地位，但在春假兩字的名義下，已得到了普遍的默認。</p>
<p>在此提倡生活節約聲中，在前後不到兩個月中覺有兩度新年，原不十分合理。不過在我國的農業社曾生活未經改變以前，農歷新年大概還得過下去。歐美人向聖誕節後接着度新年，和我們在送灶後準備過年，雖方式不同，而同爲一　民族的風俗習慣則是一樣。</p>
<p>有些人認爲一個民族的生活習慣，應該迎合世界潮流；換句話說，就是應該使生活習慣力求進步化，冀達到人類文化與文明高度統一的止境。這誠然是無可非議的見解，所謂風俗習慣與民族文化，原無固定不變之理，因爲無論是風俗習慣或文化傳統，都不外是某種生活方式的結果，而生活方式雖非刻刻在變化，却是富於變化性的。</p>
<p>現在逢到過年過節，雖然仍舊保持着許多傳統的儀節，但較之十年二十年前，究竟冲淡得多了。這一部份固然因爲是民生着條，大家早已較不起興來，一部份則不能不說是受了較高世界文化的影響。</p>
<p>文化雖然是一種抽象的東西，但其影饗久而久之是　得見覺得着的，如基督敎文化之一的歪誕節，在中國的都市社會中，已逐漸成爲一種固定的節目，反之，我們的舊式假期，則已在逐漸冲淡中。即在日當生活中，西方生活文化的影響，也正在侵蝕着我們向來的生活習慣。</p>
<p>你說這是我們的進步，固無不可，因爲西方生活文化確有許多地方比較我們固有的爲合理，可是你有時却又感到有些悵惘。雖明知道你現在所得到的，比之你所失去的也許更有價値，但有時仍不免感到若有所失。對於這種心理上的感覺，你覺得並不能用單純的懷舊感情加以解釋。懷舊的感情也許不免，然而你的惆悵實在較此更深。</p>
<p>其實說穿了並不足奇。因爲現在我們所接受的新的生活文化，祇是新皮囊裝的陳酒而已，裝璜雖在改變中，而內容則不僅依然如舊，且更在腐蝕中。酒固然是越陳越好，不過一個民族的生活文化，雖然亦得經過發酵的過程，但却決不是越陳越好。我們所以不得不向較高的外來文化低頭，正就是一個證明。真正的酒與其所盛裝的東西並無關係，然而由生活所釀成的生活文化，則必須具備表裏一致的關係。</p>
<p>我這樣說，並不是主張固有的生活習慣不可廢，而是說一個民族的生活文化，應就其本身的血液中培養新的生命。　曆年新暦年都不過是形式，唯有創造新的內容，才是一切生活形式的最後決定。</p>
<h3>退休敎員</h3>
<p>— 言平</p>
<p>在本月十三日申報敎育新聞欄裹，看到一段極平淡而慘痛的無聞。</p>
<p>據載，有退休敎員某君，因年過而不能再繼續担任敎職，曾　敎育局發給養老金退休。某君因難糾生活，呈請敎育局轉呈市政府，請求實物配給，又經轉呈行政院核示，結果，終因退休教員　配實物，與規定不符，「未使照准」。</p>
<p>我人且別硏究退休敎員應否獲得配給，須爲退休敎員的生活問題，仔細的討論一下：</p>
<p>敎師的待遇，誰都認爲是極度的菲薄，即使在職時能敷　過去日當的最低生活，己是大幸，根本談不上積蓄。一旦年老退休，除非子孫們有力奉養，否則老來受苦，是必然的結局—我想，老敎師投江自盡的慘劇，讀者們尚能記憶吧？</p>
<p>請求實物配給，某君似乎也太奢望了。雖然當年也是「公敎人員」之一，但是能已退休，當然已和「公敎」兩字就此脫離，以非公敎人員，而請求公敎配給，怎能獲得核准呢？</p>
<p>何况，在敎育不分公私的原則下的私校敎師，就爲犯了個「私」字的頭銜，尚且不獲享受「公敎」的優待哩！所以退休敎員請配實物，「未便照准」，也是必然的批覆！</p>
<p>某君旣因「年邁」而退休，那麼，一定服務敎育界很久了，他的歷年的學生，定然遍及四方，或許其中一部分，已變成了高車駟馬的豪富貴人，可是雖能再念及幼年身受培育的老師？</p>
<p>但，某君會任市校敎師，還是不幸中之大幸！至少在退休時，已領得敎育局所發的養老金。雖僅每月數十元，然而也得依指數加成。無諭如何　總可「聊勝於無」吧？</p>
<p>「比上不足，比下有餘」。我不知全市兩萬左右的私校敎師，到將來年邁退休時，即使區區的養老金，向那裹去領？</p>
<h3>糖份與犯罪</h3>
<p>新齊蘭監獄中的醫生和精神病專家，對於犯罪之理由及可能的治療方法，供獻了一個最原始的意兄。他們在偵查各種罪行的時候，發現罪犯的血液中有輸著的葡萄糖缺乏　。</p>
<p>「缺少糖素使個人有犯罪和劇烈行爲，動作粗暴慓悍，且容易發怒」，他們說。「只要個人體內的糖份增加之後，這種現象即可避免。」</p>
<p>這也許就是歐洲犯罪事件日有發生的許多理由之　。（駝）</p>
<h3>溫情</h3>
<p>— 賓如</p>
<p>人類旣有靈感，就無法不要溫情，這也是就是動物生活的自然要求，誰也不能否認的。</p>
<p>要說有些冷冰冰的人往往是冷得怕人，教人無法去親近他，或者只能虛與委蛇，那是配合社會環境的表面，實則這些人也並不冷酷，一轉頭之間會得使你驚奇的，他們的情感之豐富，往往不可想像，中國如楚霸王，外國有希特拉，便是這一類的典型。</p>
<p>不用多所拉扯，我現在想到的是自己的事情。話說我們這些同事或朋友，在一處工作的不必說，分散在各處的更不必說，總是時常想敍敍的；在工作塲所每天見面，大致總還不能滿足，分散在別處的自然更想見見。所以必須找機會約會在工作以外的地方，如茶館泗店或者是某一個朋友的家。</p>
<p>這一天我聽見習評和老路約了明天在龍記喝茶吃點心，第二天我就自動去加入了。不幸我到得太遲，當我跨上龍記茶樓時，已經是下午四點，只見夥計已在開始收拾，正把所有的櫈子在一雙雙四脚朝天地放上桌去，只剩習評一個客人靜靜地靠在隻牆一角的椅上，好像和地上所有的垃一圾樣，在等候夥計的收拾。</p>
<p>我先說：</p>
<p>「一個人？」</p>
<p>「老路失信。」</p>
<p>習評遞了一支烟給我，於是我也坐下了。</p>
<p>關於失信，我們大家都不十分重視，因爲有時太陽月亮也會失信的，這一天就沒有太陽，習評的所謂失信，大約也是爲了太陽失信，不禁要把老路的失信重視起來了。窗外是陰沉沉地，習評望着天花板說：</p>
<p>「好像要下雪了！」</p>
<p>夥計一邊掃地一邊哼着廣東調，七八張桌子上已經佈滿了朝天的櫈脚，一　冷落的風趣點綴了人生的悲劇，同時也觸動了人的世故。於是我說：</p>
<p>「打烊了！」</p>
<p>夥計怱然抬頭向我笑笑，他說：</p>
<p>「不碍事，你們多坐一會不要緊。」</p>
<p>不但不要緊，而且他把掃帶放了，去提着開水來又把我們的茶壺冲滿了。</p>
<p>我也不禁笑了笑；屋喪屋外其實是同樣灰色的，不過這時覺得外面的天色更其灰暗了。有時溫情是十分傷害人心的，但是人類就天生了自虐狂。</p>
<p>所以我們就不得不無動於中地離了茶樓，然後又離了習評，直到聽不見了那夥計的廣東調，直到一個個在燈下伏在案頭忙碌着的人頭代替了許多桌子上櫈脚，纔又想着幾時再和朋友到什麼地方去敍敍。</p>
<p>這個足證燈光非但不能代替太陽，即連灰色的天都不如，而强調人生即爲工作者，多少總有一歷要把活的人類變人死的機械的　心的嫌疑。抹殺人性的事到底是不行的，此即所以世界擾攘不休之故。小題不可大做，現在應該結束了，我說：人類所能，所願，所愛忍受的虐害，除了溫情，什麼都談不到。</p>

<p>卿笑一笑道：「你祇爲你個人打算，沒替別人設想。」渚　道：「我純爲別人打算，我若是祗爲自己打算，我常和尚去，最爲乾脆！」　卿道：「得了！不用說當和尚，這話我已經聽了多少次，我祇希望你，將來事成，不要昧了良心，事負了別人。」渚　道：「我不爲要遽最初的目的，才不這樣幹呢！　鄉道：「我祇希望她能覺悟，這事便好辦，若是執抝不肯，我也無可如何。我爲你們二人前途幸福，姑且試一試。」渚　又連連鞠躬道：「那太好了，你就給我走一趙。雲卿道：「這事不是三言兩語可以解決的，也不是走一趨見一面便能成功的，萬一說不成功，鬧出事來，你可別怪我！」渚齊道：「不成功不過我倒霉而已，不至　鬧出什麼事。」雲卿道：「怎麼不能呀，她一聰這話不對題，告訴你父親去，這事不糟糕嗎！就是不告訴你父親，和你大關一塲，你也受不了。」渚齊道：「和我吵架，我不怕；告訴我父親，那可糟了，這事全使你看着感化她，呌她明晚利害，自動地提出離婚，那是最妙不過，以你幹才，這一些小事，總可以馬到成功。」說着又連連鞠躬。雲卿祇端坐不動，停了一會，把臉一扳道：「我還要問你一句話。這事假定辦成功，第一步你如何辦法？」渚齋道：「第二步辦法，你還猜不出嗎，我認爲不必我多說。」說着，着疊上中指和大姆指，向雲卿臉上一揚，拍哧一響。雲卿臉上一紅道：「你別高興，我認爲將來還有難題重重呢！」渚齋道：「你不說過嗎？事在人爲，有志者事竟成，我是豁出去幹一幹，你　道沒這勇氣？」雲卿道：「你不要說嘴，等你父親發脾無的時候，看你敢不敢豁出去？」渚齋笑道：「不會的，不會的，我今天心上本是非常難過，給你如此一來，我痛快極了，我們出去吃小館如何？」雲卿道：「不必，你來時我已經呌他們預備飯了。」渚齋看一看手錶道：「我們吃完飯，你給我去一趨好不好？」雲卿道：「你就這樣性急，我不去，你又要怪我不熱心，你要知道我何嘗不是性急，答應了人家一宗事，好似負一身債，不立刻還淸，心上不舒服。」說着，兩人不言而喩，都笑起來。（本章完）</p>
<h3>「名」與「實」</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>凡在外國是極好的事情，一搬到我們中國來，不論事情大小，往往總會變質走樣·這不是我贊成月亮也是外國的好這句話，一切的事確是極少例外，才敢大阻下這斷語。</p>
<p>就我自己內行，舉一件事來說說。在公立學校裏，所謂公費生，當然一切學·膳·宿，甚至制服雜用等費，例由公家供給，而且我也在報上，看到過教育部頒布的堂皇條例，也是這樣規定。然而事實呢？我有一個孩子，去年考入了一個省立師範學校，初入學時，照例要交醫藥·圖書·實騐·材料·制服等費不必說，而且還要白米八十斤，不交淸楚，休想住進學校裏，價然更休想上課。據說白米八十斤，是因省裏公費拖欠，學校裏墊不出來，所以暫借，等到學期結束，照數發還。話旣說得頗近情理，而且所費總比其他學校爲省，不繳又不成，那自然祇有奉命唯謹了。</p>
<p>誰知這却成了例規，每個學期開始，總是通知因爲公費拖欠，要學生每人暫繳八十斤白米。去年上學期粒米不還，下學期到將痲暑假，學生要求發還，鬧了一次風潮，弄得大衆皆知了，於是才允許發還。然而發還了多少呢？大概是不到七折八扣。本學期呢？聽說要請學生捐助給學校，又不發還了。</p>
<p>我以爲要收膳米，爽爽快快明白規定，要多要少，讓大家公開知道，護得起的自會來讀。現在學生祖了公費生之名，將來畢業後每人都有服務三年的義務，而權利却祇享得一部份，那不是各不副實嗎？在外國的所謂公費生，我想決不如是。</p>
<p>因此，我想到，這全是個「名」與「實」的問題。中國古代聖人，對於名實問題，看得十分嚴重，可是從古以來，中國民族，一向犯着這個名實不副的大病。甚至建立一種學說，創辦一種事業，動機緣由，都說到極好，可是大都另有目的。嘴裏所說，往往和心理所想的，完全不是一樣。</p>
<p>所以，我以爲我們還得著重名實問題。爲實而務名果然最好，爲名而務實也總是好的，最要不得的是名不副實，或名實相背。我爲什麼說爲各而務實也總是好的呢？你想；一個發了大財的人想做慈善事業，博個慈等大家之名，這總不見得對於大衆有害無益吧？至於公費生要收費，道用無論什麼樣新的辦證方法，我想是總沒法說出攻擊不破的理由來的。</p>
<p>游泳島　士師</p>
<p>游泳島，一名河島，居住處大都在普通鳥類所不能到達之瀑布後，其巢乃以鮮苔構成。每出巢或歸巢時，必經越過瀑布，故義成優越的涉水技能。它們的食物是急流中的小蟲，當它們潛入水底找尋食物時，若發現了目標，就立刻展開雙翅，「飛行」過去，捕提它的俘虜。因它並沒有蹼或鰭等游泳「工具」，故並不能游泳，僅能在水中振震而「飛」，有如在空中一般。</p>
<h3>舊王孫畫筆</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>外國有一藝術傢　　，一個人興匆匆的跑來想定購一幅，指着壁上掛的一幅畫問藝術家，這幅畫是什麼思想·藝術家說是春半嚙草　。買畫的人問草在那裏，回答是都被半吃完了，再追問一句：「牛呢」？藝術家的回答很乾脆，草旣然嚼完，牛也望望然去了！</p>
<p>這故事充份暴露了外國一批空頭　師的醜態，他們也許開一個展鑒會，但不知　的是什麼東西，居然標着高昂的價格，如其有人傎的買他一幅，不會是帶了一幅已經被嚼完了靑草，通牛也不知去向的岡書回去一般。這在上海的許多空頭書畫展電會裏不乏例子，掛在壁上的等於白　一幅，　賞起來，還是精緻的裱工値得摩婆。</p>
<p>而西山逸士傅心畬先生的畫便不是這一批「春牛嚙草圖」，他的山水及其自創宗派的設色已把藝術的靈魂，通過彩筆，傳逹到紙上來。鑒賞傳儒先生的畫，就是從畫面上看到了一個　王孫淡泊自甘的心境，最能代表的是幾幅冬景。便是寫春日山明水秀的風景，從來沒有用過絇　的畫　去　衆取寵，而是使你的想像自然而然地跑到一處寂寂的山谷，這山谷裏也許有迎風楊柳，滿枝紅花，但掩不住孤芳自堂的高格。他需要你自走到畫境中去，可從沒有把手招引，歡迎着你的來臨。</p>
<p>我對於國畫是十足門外，但對於　王孫的盡筆，有一稱偏愛，從他的身世，環境，以及近年來環繞於他周圍的事故去看畫，似乎所有的恩怨都從畫籌上昇化，結晶成一幅無上的藝術品。從他的幾行題時裏，更可以捉換出他一部份心情來。</p>
<p>當然我祇能在展覽會裏走馬看花而已，某友人在　京時，曾以傳畫的榮實　箋紙寫信來，我至今還什　珍藏，一半是友情，一半就是爲了舊王孫的畫筆。</p>
<h3>畫家</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>十八世紀時，美國的畫家大多恃爲富翁們畫像爲生。但那些一富翁舉竟不脫暴發戶習氣，不但當喜自作主張，而且毫無耐心，不肯連坐一個月或二十天供　家們描繪。於是畫家們想出了一個辦法，他們光畫好了各種不同姿勢穿各種豪行服飾的人物，祇留了面部一塊是空白，顧主們祇須任意點定一張，畫家們就匆匆替他畫好面部，結果皆大歡喜，畫家們也大發其財。</p>
<p>但中古世紀的俄國畫家則又不同。他們雖有一部份是畫人像的，但大多都以畫「神」像爲要務。爲了使畫中「傳神」起見，他們往往先在畫紙或布上畫一副姿勢優美的髑髏，再在髑髏上加上各種肉體器官，然後再加上衣服冠履，故每遇　幅上衣　的彩色剝落，輙可看見肉體或甚至裏面白皚皚的骨殖。據說如此則每一張畫都可有其個性云。</p>
<h3>談曾國藩</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>曾國藩從民族立塲而諭，固應稱爲「罪人」，但置此不論，而單就其生平辦事來看，却很有臨雖應變的精神和手段。</p>
<p>當太平軍興起的時候，正是一淸代政治最黑暗的時候，太平天國所以能佔地至十七省之廣，維持至十五年之久，大半還是一般不肖官吏所養成的。曾氏一面在軍事上和太平軍相周旋，一面竭力澄淸吏治。他本身淸勤，又有整飭的決心，能力，和辦法，使吏治煥然一新，因此軍事也得順利進展。曾氏的治吏方法，分選史，察吏，訓吏，卹吏四項，　吏和訓更，更爲重要。他對於現任官吏，嚴行考續，賞罰分明，人心爲之振奮。他會訂勸誡州縣四條，勸诫委員四條，均是訓吏良方。勸誠州縣的：爲治署內，明刑法，重農事，崇儉樸。勸誡委員的；爲習勤勞，崇儉約，勸學問，戒傲情。都是切中當時一般官吏的弊病。</p>
<p>曾氏旣提倡吏治，盡力訪求人才，破格任用，同時也極力從事作育培養的工夫，使無才變爲有才，小才變成大才，於是人才興起，蔚然成風。他的方法僞「宏獎人才，不遺餘力」，「至誠相與，量才錄用」，這十六個字可以包括一切了。</p>
<p>會氏作育人才，以一個抽字爲出發點。曾氏一生，勤以率下，儉以率身，不畏難，不取巧，功以讓人，勞以資己。他用這種精神來洽軍，得以振作士氣；用來整飭吏治，得以刷新政局。怎會不成事呢！</p>
<p>曾時在太平天國方面，有李秀成，陳玉成，石達開諸人。他們的智勇才略，並不在曾氏之下，而曾氏得以事成，就憑　還種方法。他以軍事爲中心，政治爲輔佐，加上培育人才，繼繼不斷地在發展，而推動這方法的力量，即在他堅忍沉毅的精神。</p>

<h3>夫妻房中口角　竟被拘打手心　川車讀者詢是否構成警</h3>
<p>編輯韓先生：</p>
<p>貴載是人民的喉舌，是社會的明鏡，是替人民伸張正義的導師，我們雖還在四川，早就深深的知道。規在是民主洪流民權伸張的時代，在中國每個角落應該充滿着光明，正義，公理，然而相反的，在川東一隅——巫山，我却遭受了極黑暗的强權侮辱。</p>
<p>此事發生在十一月一日的上午，我與我的妻子在房中管教子女，因彼此意見　突而發生口解爭執，經街　勸解，爭　已告　止。乃因我住宅與警察所不遠，適該所長李國治出街，得於旁人口中聞知，即派營士數名將我夫妻兩人拘入該所，不詢理由細情，口稱無故爭鬧，有妨害社會秩序，即欲將我夫妻各打屁股四十軍杖，後經該所巡官朱漢臣君再三　阻，乃改懲各手心二十軍杖我受此侮辱後，氣憤已極，不知道我們夫妻房中口角，在這　法上是否已構成犯罪行爲？懇請貴報能於報端有所解答。護者馮維周敬上</p>
<p>〔內政部警察總署解答〕「查夫妻房內口角，且經　人動止，依法不能構成　警以妨害社曾秩序論。再　警　法並無杖刑之規定，巫山縣警察所長李國治所爲，如係事實，於法自覺不合。被處罰人對所判處之處罰，如有不服，可依照逮警罰法第四十六條向上級官器提起訴願。」</p>
<p>（編者按）　　罰法第四十六條規定：「不服警察官署關於逹警事件之裁決者，得於接到栽決書後翌日起五日內向其上級官署提起訴願。」馮君遭此不當之處分，而法定訴願之時限已過，恐亦無可奈何矣！</p>

<h3>Bei Zuyi and Others Arrive in Washington, D.C. To Meet with Marshall Regarding Aid to China Plan; Loan Amount Rumored to be Over 500 Million</h3>
<p>(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) The Chinese technical delegation, including Bei Zuyi and two others, arrived here on the 16th to assist the U.S. government in finalizing a new aid plan for China. Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Gu Weijun and Director of the China Desk at the State Department, Mr. Lin Bide, greeted them at the airport. The other two members of the delegation were already at Mr. Lin's residence. Secretary of State Marshall has assured the delegation that he will meet with them to discuss the current economic situation in China and the various measures taken by the Chinese government. At the same time, officials stated that the new aid to China bill could be submitted to Congress for discussion before the end of the month. Rumors that the government would not submit the bill until Congress clarified its position on the aid to Europe plan were unfounded.</p>
<p>(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) Bei Zuyi stated that he did not wish to elaborate on his trip to the United States to the press. The delegation will set up an office in the Shoreham Hotel. (United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) The amount of U.S. aid to China has not yet been announced. Informed sources say that the total amount of aid to China being considered by the State Department is over 500 million dollars, but it will "undoubtedly" be revised before being submitted to Congress.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency New York, 16th, United Press) A former U.S. diplomat in China, now a well-known exporter to China, Mr. Hunter, recently called for a prompt loan of 600 million dollars to China for its industrialization. He said that this aid should be part of a comprehensive aid plan that includes military aid to China and assistance with its currency reform. The total cost would be no more than 1.5 billion, and a 600 million dollar loan to China over two years could help China overcome its current crisis. He outlined his plan in six major areas: Restore the Canton-Hankow Railway, restore factories in South China, modernize irrigation methods in South China and provide modern equipment, improve the chemical fertilizer program, provide ships to restore China's inland river and coastal shipping, and wool loans and a 3 million dollar tobacco loan. Mr. Hunter also said that the United States need not wait for Congressional action and could provide aid to China through the U.S. War Assets Administration in accordance with the law. China's application for a 22.2 million dollar line of credit to purchase surplus materials from the War Assets Administration has not yet been implemented, which he found puzzling. He also said that China needs assistance in its budget because it is plagued by war, and it is difficult for the United States to balance its budget under such circumstances, let alone demand it of China. As for the Communist Party, Mr. Hunter said that President Chiang did not eliminate the Communist Party when he could have. Mr. Hunter made a speech to more than 200 members of the Shanghai Luncheon Club, and this article is only a part of its content.</p>
<h3>U.S. to Sell Oil This Spring; We Are Allocated 600,000 Barrels; U.S. Acknowledges Our Right to Dispose of Surplus Iron Sand from Sales</h3>
<p>(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) In the quota table for petroleum products for the first quarter of 1948 announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 16th, China was allocated 60,000 barrels of aviation gasoline, 350,000 barrels of other gasoline, 110,000 barrels of kerosene, and 100,000 barrels of diesel and residue-free diesel. The total export quota is 14.47 million barrels, which is allocated to each country by the International Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Philippines was allocated 20,000 barrels of gasoline, 130,000 barrels of other types of oil, 70,000 barrels of kerosene, and 160,000 barrels of diesel and residue-free diesel. Japan and the Ryukyu Islands were not allocated aviation gasoline, but received 460,000 barrels of other types of gasoline, 50,000 barrels of kerosene, and 375,000 barrels of diesel.</p>
<p>(United Press Washington, D.C., 16th) State Department officials said that they have learned that China's resale of iron sand from surplus U.S. military materials obtained from Pacific islands to Bethlehem Steel is legal. It is said that each country can choose its own way to dispose of these materials. Because China lacks steel mills to consume large amounts of iron sand, China's sale of iron sand is logical. They pointed out that the intermediary must bear the transportation costs and responsibility, and therefore they should be entitled to a profit.</p>
<p>The White House rescinded the order last fall prohibiting China and other countries from reselling goods in contracts to the United States because the United States needed them urgently and was willing to buy them back.</p>
<h3>Lattimore and Lin Yutang Debate Aid to China Issue</h3>
<p>(U.S. Information Service, Erie, Pennsylvania, 16th) Far East experts Owen Lattimore and Dr. Lin Yutang debated the U.S. aid to China issue at a Foreign Policy Association meeting here on January 10. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Lattimore believes that military equipment shipped to the Chinese government will be lost or fall into "other hands." He also opposes financial aid, arguing that Chinese officials have large private deposits in American banks.</p>
<p>Professor Lin Yutang said, "Every U.S. dollar used by the United States to support the Chinese government can accomplish a great benefit. The Chinese government is a government recognized by all the great powers, including the Soviet Union. Supporting this government is a matter of common sense and sound strategic guidance. U.S. aid to China is most effective when it comes in the form of technical assistance. The expenditure of aid should be satisfactory to both Chinese and American authorities. This kind of aid is as decisive in Asia as the Marshall Plan can be in Europe."</p>
<p>Lattimore said, "To think of supporting the current Chinese government with cannons or money as a means of containing the Soviet Union is not only ineffective but also harmful. Today in China, a very simple and powerful nationalism is more important than ideology. Since the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the Chinese people have always felt that foreign forces and ideas are the worst threat to China's independence."</p>
<h3>U.S. Relief Grain, 125,000 Tons, to be Shipped to China Within Three Months</h3>
<p>8,000 Tons of Flour Arrive in Shanghai Today [Reported by This Newspaper] According to Mr. Chen Guangyuan, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan's U.S. Relief Materials Processing Committee, told reporters yesterday. The United States' relief grain for China, 125,000 tons, will be fully shipped to this area within three months, and in addition to 75,000 tons of rice and 50,000 tons of flour and wheat, there will also be medical supplies worth 5 million U.S. dollars and some cloth for relief in China, which will be shipped to Shanghai one after another soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also said that the third batch of 8,000 tons of flour, transported by the California Wheel Rice, was originally scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai on the 16th, but due to delays en route, it will be delayed until today. The office is scheduled to hold a welcome ceremony on the ship at the China Merchants Bureau's No. 1 Wharf at 3 p.m. tomorrow, and has specially invited Mayor Wu to deliver a welcome speech and take photos and newsreels, which will be sent to the United States to show our country's warm welcome to these materials.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Japanese Reparations Materials to Arrive in Shanghai on the 21st</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The "Hai Kang" ship, the first ship to Japan to transport reparations materials, left Yokosuka Port at noon on the 16th to return to Shanghai. According to the Ministry of Communications' Reparations Materials Transportation Office, after the ship arrives in Shanghai on the 21st, it will stop at the office's No. 8 Wharf in Zhanghuabang to unload the materials. It is reported that the "Hai Kang" ship's total weight of materials transported back this time is 1,600 tons, packed in 453 boxes. In addition, the second ship, Hai Zhe, for transporting reparations materials, will arrive in Sasebo on the afternoon of the 18th, stay overnight, and sail directly to Yokosuka on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Japanese Reparations Materials Supervision Committee held a regular meeting on the 17th at the China Merchants Bureau's 6th floor, and resolved two major cases: After the Japanese reparations materials arrive in Shanghai, the receiving and transportation work will be handled by the Ministry of Communications' Materials Storage and Transportation Administration; the ships of private shipping companies sent to Japan to transport reparations materials were originally scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 20th of this month to Sendai for loading, but because Sendai was unable to prepare in time, it was decided to postpone the departure from Shanghai to the 10th of next month.</p>
<h3>Application of Japanese Reparations Machines; Factories Relocating Inland Request Preferential Treatment</h3>
<p>[Reported by This City] Among the materials of Japan's reparations to our country, more than 9,000 units of the first batch of machine tools to be dismantled and relocated will be allocated to various state-owned enterprises, and the remaining quarter, about 2,000 units, will be sold to private enterprises. The "Shanghai Office of the United Association of Factories Relocating to Sichuan and Guangxi" previously nominated representatives Hu Juewen, Yan Yaoqiu, and Hu Yuezhong to make suggestions to the central government, requesting that the more than 2,000 units of reparations machines be first used to compensate for the losses of factories relocating inland, and the surplus be rented or purchased by factories relocating inland. The association also hosted a press conference at the Xingwuxu restaurant on the 4th floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road at 4 p.m. on the 17th to report on the suggestions made to the central government and to state the current situation. It is said that "factories relocating inland participated in the War of Resistance, and have contributed to the country. After the victory, they are in a difficult situation, and they have the right to request prior compensation for the reparations materials that are dismantled and relocated in advance. After the amount of reparations at the peace conference is determined in the future, they will be cleared. When the representatives made suggestions to the central government this time, the heads of the relevant ministries and commissions expressed deep sympathy, but the distance from the factories relocating inland is still far. It is hoped that the public opinion will uphold justice and call on the government to accept the objective requirements of the factories relocating inland."</p>
<h3>Private Trade with Japan; Plan Under Review</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The Trade Guidance Committee for Japan held its tenth meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, chaired by Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Tong Jiling. It reviewed the private trade plans for Japan submitted by 19 districts including Shanghai, but none were approved and will be reviewed at the next meeting. The Allied Headquarters in Japan inquired about our country's list of goods to be exported to Japan in 1948. Tong Jiling also presented a report at the meeting, requesting research and reply. It was decided that the Resources Committee's Import and Export Management Committee and the China Trust and other institutions would be responsible for studying the methods, formulating an export list, submitting it for discussion at the next meeting, and then replying to the Allied Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun Has Agreed to Cancel the Permit Fee for Flour Transported to the North</h3>
<p>North China Petition Delegation Arrives in Beijing Yesterday [Reported by This Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The North China petition delegation arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 17th. After taking a short rest at the hotel, they first went to the National Government to register and meet with President Chiang, and agreed to meet with Chief Secretary Wu Wenguan on the 19th. In the afternoon, they went to the Executive Yuan, but were unable to meet with President Zhang due to his busy schedule with the Guangzhou Kowloon incident, and requested an appointment to go again. Then they went to the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Food, where Gu Yuzhi, Yu Hongjun, and Guan Jiyu met with them to study various economic and food issues. Mr. Gu said that the issue of industrial and commercial loans could be discussed at the next National Economic Commission meeting, and may be issued in the form of orders in the future. Minister Yu first agreed to two things: Increase the amount of grain transported from the south to the north, and cancel the 150,000 yuan permit fee per bag of flour transported to the north. According to Mr. Liu Yaocao's statement to this newspaper, the food supply and price is one of the most serious problems in the north, and the harvest on the 17th was somewhat gratifying. They hope that other issues can also be resolved smoothly after meeting with President Chiang and President Zhang.</p>
<p>The plan for Tianjin to purchase grain with foreign exchange earned from exports has reportedly received attention from the authorities. Chief Secretary Wu Wen-guan and Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan both believe that this plan is far-sighted and will do their best to facilitate it. According to estimates from traders here, Tianjin's exports can earn 10 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange in February and April, which can purchase 1.1 million bags of large flour, which can maintain the needs of the Pingjinbao area for a relatively long period of time.</p>
<p>The Five-Province Pacification Conference Will Close Today</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper Nanchang, 17th] The Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi pacification conference will continue to hold a general meeting on the morning of the 18th to discuss proposals, and will close at noon.

In the afternoon, Minister Bai also went to the Dajiaochang to inspect the militia self-defense teams of six townships in Jiujiang, with more than 20,000 participants. Mr. Bai can return to Nanchang on the 18th.</p>

<h3>Northeast Sets Up Bandit Suppression Headquarters; Wei Lihuang Appointed Commander-in-Chief; Chu Xichun and Two Others Tentatively Selected as Deputies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 17th] The National Government issued an order on the 17th specially appointing Wei Lihuang as Deputy Director of the National Government Chairman's Northeast Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Bandit Suppression.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The Executive Yuan's Information Bureau announced that the Ministry of National Defense believes that the Northeast problem is complex and multifaceted, and at present, political, economic, and military matters are all concentrated in the Northeast Headquarters.

<h3>Purchase of Export Goods; Adopt Flexible Methods; National Economic Small Group Meeting Revised and Approved</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The National Economic Commission held a small group meeting on the morning of the 17th to review the method for purchasing export goods again. Chen Qitian presided over the meeting. The method was revised and approved in accordance with the secret investigation opinions reported by Chen Qitian at the National Economic Commission's regular meeting on the 8th, adopting a flexible purchase method to maintain the market and ensure that our country's goods are exported regularly to earn foreign exchange. As for silk exports, due to the impact of Japanese silk exports, we are still losing money, and another method will be formulated or finished products will be manufactured first and then exported. It is heard that this method will be submitted for discussion at the next National Economic Commission meeting. The revised review opinions are as follows: Purchasing principles. A. Export goods shall be transported and sold freely by merchants in accordance with the government's foreign exchange settlement method. B. If merchants cannot transport and sell due to the price problem in the foreign market, the government will purchase them. This kind of purchase is neither a unified purchase nor a permanent purchase. Purchasing scope is limited to agricultural products and special industrial products that have sales in foreign countries, such as bristles, tung oil, tea, soybeans, egg products, and raw silk. Wool will not be purchased. The purchasing agency shall be hosted by the Telegraph Administration. The purchasing price shall be reviewed by the Price Review Committee of each agency. The price shall be based on the principle of taking into account the profits of producers. The Price Review Committee shall be composed of the China Trust Bureau, the Management Committee, the Central Bank, the Audit Department, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the National Economic Commission. The purchasing method shall be formulated by the Telegraph Administration and submitted for approval. The quality of export goods purchased must be standardized, and the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall strictly inspect them. As for how to increase costs, the Ministry of Agriculture shall formulate a method. The profits and losses of exported goods shall be borne by the national treasury.</p>

Regarding the retention period of the list of legislative electors, after the district election office is closed, it will be transferred to the civil affairs departments of each province for safekeeping.</p>
<p>(Reported by This Newspaper Nanjing, 17th) The National Assembly Representative Central Nomination Elected Person Association recently issued a declaration, making a statement on the election matter. The declaration puts forward the so-called error of the law not being retroactive, the legality of the political party nominating party member candidates, the nomination of the Xiaoshu should be limited to social elites, and the purpose of the formal and candidate candidates determined by the central government is for competition between political parties, not for competition between formal and candidate candidates. Party discipline and the leader's will are not allowed to be destroyed, and public opinion is not allowed to be borrowed. If the formal candidate receives fewer votes, it is not their fault, so the central government should not accommodate the few who violate the order and are elected. It is hoped that the central government will maintain its original decision, thoroughly implement the President's will, so as to clarify right and wrong, distinguish good from evil, and maintain the dignity of party discipline, national law, and the prestige of the central government.</p>
<h3>The North China剿總 (Suppression General Headquarters) Releases the Account of Army Commander Lu Ying's Suicide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th Dispatch] The North China Bandit Suppression General Headquarters released the account of the suicide of the 35th Army Commander, Lu Yingchen, stating: The Laishui Campaign concluded at noon on the 13th. In this battle, Li Mingding, commander of the 32nd Division of the 35th Army, led two regiments to reinforce friendly forces, engaging in repeated assaults against bandits twenty times the size of the National Army. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the battle never ceased for a single minute, ultimately achieving brilliant results, killing or wounding over ten thousand communist bandits, capturing over two hundred, and seizing one thousand firearms. However, Division Commander Li Mingding unfortunately died in action at the forefront, resulting in over five hundred officer and soldier casualties, over one thousand wounded, and the loss of four mountain guns, several mortars, over ten heavy machine guns, and over five hundred rifles due to the deaths and injuries of officers and soldiers, preventing their retrieval. After Commander Lu Yingchen returned to Gaobeidian following the end of the battle, he reviewed the campaign and, despite having completed the important task of assisting friendly forces, was deeply troubled by the significant loss of weapons. Upholding the traditional spirit of the 35th Army, he worried throughout the night and ultimately committed suicide in Gaobeidian on the morning of the 14th. Upon hearing the news, the Commander-in-Chief was deeply shocked by Commander Lu's suicide, not in battle, but out of a sense of responsibility and commitment to his duty, considering it an act of self-sacrifice for righteousness. The remains of Lieutenant General Lu and Major General Li were transported to Zhangyuan on the 17th and will be buried in the Martyrs' Cemetery. Lu was a native of Yuanqu, Shanxi, and a graduate of the fifth class of the Baoding Military Academy and the second special class of the Army University, aged fifty-five.</p>

<h3>Authorities Pay Attention to the Shameen Incident, Sending Personnel to Guangzhou to Investigate the Truth, Negotiations on the Kowloon Walled City Case Follow the Established Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] News from the Executive Yuan Information Bureau: Since the Kowloon Walled City incident occurred, the government authorities have been paying close attention to it, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has separately engaged with the Hong Kong government and the British Embassy in Nanjing. Unexpectedly, during a demonstration by the people of Guangzhou on the 16th, some unruly elements disregarded the advice of the police and rushed into Shameen, setting fire to the British Consulate and injuring British nationals. After learning of this, President Zhang attached great importance to the matter and repeatedly telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments, strictly ordering that any illegal acts of violence, regardless of the name or reason invoked, should be severely punished according to the law. He also instructed the provincial and municipal leaders to effectively protect the lives and property of British consulates and British nationals. At the same time, he instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively negotiate with the British side according to the established policy, seeking a swift and reasonable resolution to the case. He also ordered the Ministry of the Interior to immediately dispatch personnel to Guangzhou to investigate the circumstances of the incident, report the details, and then handle the matter separately according to the law. The Ministry of the Interior has dispatched Pan Hankui, a senior supervisor of the Police Headquarters, by train to Shanghai on the night of the 17th, and he is scheduled to fly to Guangzhou on the 19th for investigation. Minister Zhang summoned Supervisor Pan on the evening of the 17th and gave the following instructions regarding this mission: Investigate the circumstances of the incident, including the safety of British Consulate personnel and British nationals, and the extent of property damage; effectively instruct the local police authorities to take effective measures to protect the safety of foreigners.</p>

<p>[Another Dispatch] Police Director-General Tang Zong stated that from the perspective of the police, while expressing sympathy for the student demonstrations, consideration must also be given to the dignity of the nation, and it is hoped that there will be no excessive actions that increase the government's difficulties.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident, after continuous discussions between Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Stevenson on the 15th and 16th, a considerable agreement had already been reached: The British government would order the Hong Kong government to cease any coercive actions; residents in the demolition area would be temporarily provided with housing by the Hong Kong side; the disputed area would be developed into a park; compensation would be paid for the losses suffered due to the Hong Kong police's coercive actions and expenses. However, the Shameen incident occurred on the afternoon of the 16th, and the British ambassador stated that he reserved certain rights, suspending the negotiations.

<h3>Weekly Forum - On the Kowloon Walled City Incident</h3>
<p>— Zhou Youcun</p>
<p>1.  The Expansion of the Kowloon Walled City Incident.</p>
<p>The British flag in Burma was officially lowered on the 4th of this month, demonstrating that Britain's Far East policy after the war has gradually become more reasonable, which is gratifying. Unexpectedly, on the 5th, the Hong Kong and Kowloon police, under the command of the British government, armedly entered the Kowloon Walled City, forcibly demolishing the homes of Chinese residents and arresting Zhu Pei, the chairman of the Kowloon Walled City Residents Association, and Liu Yifu, the residents' representative. Although the Chinese government expressed its hope that this issue could be resolved through legal channels, the Hong Kong authorities insisted on their own way and brazenly dispatched fully armed British police on the morning of the 12th, opening fire on our unarmed residents and throwing tear gas, injuring eight people. The Kowloon Walled City incident has thus expanded, making it impossible for any Chinese person to remain silent.</p>
<p>The Kowloon Walled City incident can simply be said to be the first humiliation encountered since China abolished unequal treaties! We are definitely not emotionally driven and deliberately exaggerating to harm the Sino-British friendship and diplomatic relations that have been constantly improving since the Second World War. However, we cannot help but express great indignation at the Hong Kong government's illegal behavior. At the same time, we also feel very sorry for the Hong Kong government's unintelligent, inhumane behavior that hinders the progress of Sino-British relations!</p>
<p>Although the authorities of the Hong Kong government are accustomed to the imperialist approach to treating colonies, they should also know that the Chinese and British nations fought side by side in the Second World War, jointly resisting Japanese aggression. Moreover, seeing China's emphasis on morality and love of peace, Britain took the lead in abolishing the unequal treaties between China and Britain on January 11, 1943. Subsequently, the exchange of envoys between the two countries further showed the gradual progress of their friendly relations. Last year, the British Parliamentary Delegation to China also saw how China was gaining Britain's true friendship in order to strengthen trade between them and prevent British commerce from withdrawing from the Far East market. Unfortunately, the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue has become a major obstacle to the enhancement of Sino-British diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>At a time when China and Britain are making every effort to promote diplomatic relations, the Hong Kong government is only using the "reason" that the residents of Kowloon Walled City are filthy, unhygienic, and if disease occurs, it will spread to residents outside the city; that after the demolition of the houses in Kowloon Walled City, a park will be built, and the construction of the park will also be very beneficial to the health of the original Chinese residents; that according to international law, the government can advise residents to pay attention to hygiene, and then use force to demolish the homes of Chinese residents, causing them injury and loss. This is truly a miracle in the history of international relations. We must not turn a blind eye to this new pain after the old wounds have not yet healed.</p>
<p>2.  To Whom Does the Sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City Belong?</p>
<p>The residents of a city should be hygienic, but hygiene is one issue, and invading a friendly country is another issue, and there must be a distinction between the two. According to the Sino-British treaty concluded in 1860, China only allowed the lease of Kowloon as a barrier to Hong Kong. The old site of Kowloon Walled City and Longjin Datong are still Chinese territory, and all administrative power belongs to China and is governed by Baoan County of Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>In order to fully understand whether the sovereignty of Kowloon belongs to China or Britain, let us further trace some of the past history.</p>
<p>After Britain entered China through the door of the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing on August 29, 1842, ceded Hong Kong to the British Empire. Britain has always adopted a two-pronged system for occupied areas. In order to defend Hong Kong, it attempted to occupy a place on the opposite bank of the Chinese mainland, separated only by a strip of water. The Kowloon Peninsula on the north shore of Hong Kong at that time became the second target. In the Treaty of Beijing on September 11, 1860, she again ceded 1,700 square miles of Kowloon from China. On June 9, 1898 (that is, the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu), China and Britain signed the "Convention Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory," which made the entire Kowloon Peninsula leased by Britain for ninety-nine years. The islands north of 22 degrees 9 minutes north latitude and east of 113 degrees 52 minutes to 114 degrees 30 minutes east longitude, as well as Dapeng Bay, Shenzhen Bay, and the surrounding waters of Hong Kong, were all included. The treaty stipulated the following for the Kowloon Walled City issue, which has become a problem today: "All Chinese officials stationed in Kowloon City may continue to perform their duties in the city, provided that they do not interfere with the military preparations for the defense of Hong Kong. The rest of the newly leased land shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the British. The land route from Kowloon to Xin'an (that is, Shian) shall be open to Chinese officials and civilians as usual, and the old pier area near Kowloon City shall be reserved to allow Chinese soldiers, merchants, and boats to come and go and dock at will, and also to allow officials in the city to walk at will," and it was also stated: "It is agreed that within the extended boundaries, residents shall not be forced to move." This is tantamount to stating that Britain recognized that the sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City completely belonged to China; otherwise, Chinese officials would not be able to perform their duties in the city, and Chinese military and merchant ships would not be able to dock at will. This also explains that the Hong Kong police's demolition of Chinese residents' houses in Kowloon is illegal and violates the treaty. Because it is stipulated that "residents shall not be forced to move out," but now the houses of residents are demolished, making them homeless, then it is even more inexplicable!</p>
<p>3.  Britain Cannot Shake China's Existing Treaty Rights in Kowloon Walled City.</p>
<p>Although the British officially took over the extended boundary on April 17, 1899, the villagers of Kam Tin closed the village gate to resist, causing the British to accuse Chinese officials of failing to assist effectively, and on May 16, all Chinese officials in Kowloon were expelled, making it impossible for the Chinese government to actually exercise sovereignty in Kowloon ever since. However, this cannot shake China's existing treaty rights.</p>
<p>When the Chinese officials were expelled from Kowloon Walled City, there were only more than 50 households and about 1,000 residents, both men and women. The British never expressed anything about this, which was completely different from the situation in the other New Territories. This shows that the British did not dare to rashly recognize their sovereignty there. However, gradually, the Hong Kong government began to pay attention to this, and in June 1933, on the pretext that the city was full of slums, the place was unclean, and it was harmful to hygiene, it notified the residents of the city to move to Gou Ling, near the airport, by compensating for the price of the property. The residents of the city refused to accept this illegal request, so they did not comply. The Hong Kong government brought up the old case again the following year, and eventually, because the residents were unwilling to move, they elected representatives to petition the Chinese government, and Gan Jiehou, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, protested to the Hong Kong government according to the treaty, and the matter was eventually dropped. In 1940, the Hong Kong government, for the third time, used the excuse that the owner of the property demanded strict enforcement and demolished the houses of the residents in the city. At that time, China was engaged in the war against aggression and had no time to take care of it or seriously protest to the British government, so the Hong Kong government secretly achieved its task. But soon the residents built wooden houses again, and the Hong Kong government had no way to destroy the indomitable national spirit of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after Britain agreed to abolish extraterritoriality in China, return concessions, and revise treaties based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the imperialist posture of the British colonial government remained unchanged. It issued an eviction order on November 27 last year, wanting to evacuate about 2,000 Chinese residents of Kowloon Walled City from their existing wooden houses, and set a deadline of December 10. At that time, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said: "If they do not evacuate, the Hong Kong government will order them to move quickly." The representatives of the Kowloon Residents Association stated at a press conference on December 6 that they resolutely refused to withdraw from the area, and said: "Even if it means risking bloodshed, we will not hesitate." Guo Dehua, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, anticipated the possible development of this issue and negotiated with the Hong Kong government, but to no avail, so he had to fly to Beijing to ask for instructions. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was busy with other matters at that time and did not take active action on this, and the Hong Kong government thought that there was another opportunity to take advantage of, so it ignored the law and facts and finally caused an unfortunate bloody tragedy.</p>
<p>4.  Kowloon Walled City Should Be Returned to China Soon!</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong police entered Kowloon Walled City on January 12 and injured the residents, the Chinese government received the news, and Foreign Minister Wang summoned British Ambassador Stevenson to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day, requesting the London government to immediately instruct the Governor of Hong Kong to terminate all negotiations and actions in Kowloon Walled City during this negotiation period, and not to send police into the city again. Regarding the Chinese government's written requests on the 8th concerning the Hong Kong government's forcible demolition of residents' houses in Kowloon Walled City, the British government must attach importance to the friendly relations between the two countries and their people, and stop continuing to take these measures in Hong Kong. Foreign Minister Wang also asked him to urge the British side to accept them. However, on the 13th, Kowloon Walled City was still guarded by armed police, monitoring the residents and not allowing them to rebuild. Britain's unbridled and wanton actions in China's sovereign territory are a shameful act of aggression.</p>
<p>The British government should know that the ugly faces of the aggressors of any imperialist era can no longer exist today, and British gentlemen with political vision, especially the leaders of the Labour Party, must have a correct understanding of the success or failure of the British Empire's colonial policy and how it is reacting. If they continue to use the failed methods of dealing with colonies to deal with China, a true friendly country, it is obviously too inappropriate to think about the future of the British Empire.</p>
<p>What Britain should especially know is that since the unequal treaties between China and Britain have been abolished, in principle, both Kowloon and Hong Kong should be returned to China. Because according to the promises of the United States and Britain and the Atlantic Charter, China has recovered Lushun, Datong, and Taiwan, and France has also returned Guangzhou Bay. Therefore, the return of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau, and other places should also be no exception. The leased area of Kowloon should be returned first to comply with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Since the Labour Party came to power in Britain, it has changed its previous imperialist policy. It has successively abandoned its rule over its colonies such as India and Burma and allowed them to become independent. Moreover, after this war, Britain's future strategic layout has greatly changed. Under the threat of the atomic bomb, the tiny Hong Kong and Kowloon have lost their military importance. However, if Britain continues to occupy them, it means that world politics has not yet been incorporated into the right path.</p>
<p>But we must know that today is neither the Opium War period nor the Boxer Rebellion period. Friendly countries that interact with China today must no longer treat China with the hideous faces of imperialism. The Chinese people today will no longer shut themselves off or even blindly exclude foreigners as they did in the past. We hope that the Hong Kong government will not continue its unwise actions and damage Sino-British diplomatic relations; at the same time, we also hope that the Chinese people will use their rationality to urge the government to change its weak attitude, argue on the basis of reason, but must not rely on the violence of the mob to take excessive actions, such as burning down the British Consulate in Guangzhou on the 16th, to increase the estrangement between China and Britain. Otherwise, not only Sino-British diplomatic relations but the entire world will be greatly affected.</p>

<h3>Declaration by University Presidents in Guangzhou: The Student Movement to Protect Rights Deserves Sympathy, Rioters Taking the Opportunity to Cause Trouble Should Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] Regarding the unfortunate Shameen incident, the presidents of various universities and colleges in Guangzhou issued a joint declaration on the 17th as follows: "The motivation of the students from various schools participating in the citywide demonstration parade to protest the forcible demolition of residents' homes in Kowloon Walled City is purely patriotic and enthusiastic. As teachers, we have always taught people to love the country, so we have no objection, but we have repeatedly instructed them beforehand to maintain good civil order. However, after the parade disbanded, some rioters took the opportunity to join in arson and burn down the British Consulate, which made us sigh with regret! Patriotic parades are one thing, and arson and sabotage are another. The two cannot be confused. The former should be given sympathy, and the latter should be punished by law, and there should be absolutely no leniency. In order to express our attitude from the perspective of those of us in the school, we jointly advocate that the perpetrators of this evil act be severely punished according to the law in order to maintain discipline. We hereby declare this, hoping that all sectors at home and abroad will understand. Wang Xinggong, President of National Sun Yat-sen University, Li Yinglin, President of Lingnan University, Wu Dingxin, President of National University, Wang Zhiyuan, President of Guangzhou University, Huang Linshu, President of Wanghai University, He Qizhan, Dean of Provincial College of Arts and Sciences, Zhang Liangxiu, Dean of Provincial College of Law, Ding [illegible], President of Provincial [illegible] Vocational School, Xu [illegible] Hui, President of Provincial Physical Education Vocational School, Wu Yong, Dean of Chinese Culture College, Lu Gandong, Dean of Guangzhou Law School."</p>
<h3>Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and Others Talk About the Shameen Case: Demolition of Houses and Disturbances Are Both Regrettable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding his views on the Kowloon Walled City issue, Vice President Sun Ke stated that he believes that a solution can be obtained through diplomatic channels. However, the Guangzhou incident was an unnecessary complication and is extremely regrettable. Hong Lanyou, secretary of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, stated: The student movement currently caused by the Kowloon Walled City issue cannot be said to be inappropriate, but it must not lead to unexpected xenophobic changes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Committee, told reporters: "The burning of the British Consulate in Shameen, Guangzhou, and the forced demolition of residents' homes in Kowloon Walled City, resulting in injuries from the Hong Kong police, are both unfortunate events. The Hong Kong government used the excuse of public health and fire hazards, and even failed to make proper arrangements in advance, and hastily forced residents to demolish their houses and relocate, which is deeply regrettable. As for the demonstration parade by the people of Guangzhou, it is also regrettable that the patriotic action turned into an excessive behavior due to the infiltration of rioters."</p>
<h3>British Colonial Office Statement Defends Kowloon Walled City Case</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The British Colonial Office issued a statement on the 17th to clarify the Kowloon Walled City eviction case. According to the statement, the Hong Kong authorities ordered the residents of Kowloon Walled City to move because they believed that the area posed public dangers in terms of fire and hygiene, and that adequate warnings had been given to the local residents before the eviction order was carried out, and that places to live had been suggested to the residents.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 17th] Former British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, told Chinese and foreign reporters on the 17th that he considered the Kowloon Walled City incident a "trivial matter," but the way it developed was regrettable. He believed that the reports circulating outside must have been "exaggerated."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The head of the British Information Office, Mike Fernly, met with reporters yesterday and stated: "The British expatriates in this city have all expressed shock at the Shameen incident. However, they will not express their opinions until the instigators are identified. The act of burning down the consulate is very serious in nature. It is extremely regrettable that this unfortunate incident occurred between friendly nations of China and Britain." The reporter informed him that the demolition of houses in Kowloon was the main cause of the Shameen incident, and that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a statement regretting that the British government had not intervened. Mike replied: "The London government believes that the demolition of houses in Kowloon is within the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong government. Since the Chinese government has not raised this issue with the British government, the London government will naturally not intervene. The reporter further inquired whether Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's visit to the East was to mediate the matter. Mike believed that this was only speculation from the outside world. However, Sir Kerr is a capable diplomat and has always sympathized with China. He may automatically mediate the matter. However, his visit to China this time is purely for private travel and he has no representative status. Therefore, he can only contribute his opinions in talks with Chinese government personnel. Sir Kerr has already met with President Chiang and visited President Zhang. The Kowloon Walled City issue must have been mentioned in the talks. All negotiations are currently being conducted in Nanjing. Your country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its willingness to reach a friendly agreement, which is expected to be resolved soon." When the reporter visited, the editor of the North China Daily News was also present. They were all extremely concerned about the student parade in this city. As a result, British institutions on the Bund shortened their office hours yesterday.</p>

<h3>Vice President Sun Speaks on Constitutionalism and the Constitution, Elucidating Important Provisions of the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 17th Dispatch] Vice President Sun Ke of the National Government, at the invitation of the Political Science University, gave a lecture to the students of the school at 2:00 PM on the 17th on "Constitutionalism and the Constitution." Sun's speech lasted for an hour and a half, and its content explained the spirit of the formulation of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the May 5th Draft Constitution. Then, he compared the important provisions of the Constitution with the constitutions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The main points included: elections; the part about the central government; the part about local government; the nomination issue of the general election; and provincial and county autonomy. Sun analyzed the differences between the current constitution and the May 5th Draft Constitution, stating that the current constitution is based on the May 5th Draft Constitution but has new changes, because the May 5th Draft Constitution was applicable to a country with one-party politics, but our country has evolved from one-party politics to multi-party politics, so the May 5th Draft Constitution was revised to become the current constitution. Regarding the election method, Sun stated that the task of the National Assembly, in addition to electing the president, also includes the power to amend the constitution and has a term of office. During this term of office, if the president's governance is not satisfactory to the people, a meeting to remove the president can be convened to exercise the power of removal, which is not the case in the United States. In the United States, the election first involves a national vote to elect "presidential electors." This election is completed after the president is elected, and the task is completed. The United States adopts parliamentary politics, so it is very difficult to amend the constitution. Whenever Congress proposes an amendment, it must be voted on by each state, so when there are difficulties, it often takes more than ten years to resolve. It is very easy in our country because the National Assembly is held every year, and there are opportunities to amend the constitution. Also, regarding the central government, the powers of the five branches of government take the Legislative Yuan as the highest legislative body of the country, with the power to control the Executive Yuan, because the President of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the president and can only be appointed after being approved by the Legislative Yuan. This type of legislation is equivalent to the cabinet responsibility system of the United Kingdom and France. Also, Article 55 of the Constitution stipulates that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and the government's policy guidelines must be approved by the Legislative Yuan before they can be implemented. However, it differs from the United Kingdom and France in that the British and French parliaments can adopt a vote of no confidence to overthrow the cabinet, while the government has the power to dissolve the parliament. Our government does not have the power of dissolution and cannot ask the president to dissolve the parliament. This point strengthens the [blank] of the Legislative Yuan and is a very novel system. If it is implemented, there must be a condition that there is an absolute majority party in the Legislative Yuan sufficient to support the Executive Yuan led by the same party, so that political turmoil and cabinet overturning movements will not occur at any time. Secondly, the position of our Control Yuan is equivalent to the upper house of other countries, but it does not have the power of the upper house, because the Control Yuan only has the power of consent. If the government is reorganized, the upper house can agree. The power to reorganize the government in our country belongs to the Legislative Yuan. Secondly, the Judicial Yuan, our Judicial Yuan added a grand justice system with the power to interpret the law. Sun explained the current implementation of the constitution, stating that the election part has been implemented, and the Legislative Yuan can be formed after the legislators are elected, as is the Control Yuan. The Executive, Judicial, and Examination branches will be formed after the president is elected. Regarding provincial and county autonomy, the central government and local governments adopt a system of balanced power. In the future, from county magistrates to provincial governors and provincial and municipal councils, all will adopt popular elections, from the bottom up. All of these are reforms. Regarding the issue of political parties nominating candidates, Sun stated that this is based on the precedents of various countries, and in various countries, only political parties can nominate candidates, and those without political party qualifications cannot participate in the election. Our country is handling it for the first time, and it is still possible to give non-partisan individuals the opportunity to sign nominations, but this National Assembly election has caused some disputes, which is actually due to a lack of experience in handling it for the first time. Sun said at the end that the government is currently carefully considering the general rules for provincial and county autonomy and has not yet made a decision.</p>

Agencies' subordinate institutions that have been stationed abroad, if there is no need for them to continue to exist, should be immediately dissolved and funding stopped. Hereafter, they may not be established without special approval. Various agencies shall not purchase equipment, books, or send personnel abroad unless there is a special need. Strictly limit the allocation of funds for emergency orders.</p>
<p>2. Stabilize Currency Value</p>
<p>Original Plan (1) The government should actively increase revenue and strictly limit unnecessary expenditures to gradually reduce the fiscal revenue and expenditure gap, so as to control the amount of issuance.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: (None)</p>
<p>Original Plan (2) Effectively delay the turnover rate of money.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: (None)</p>
<p>Original Plan (3) The government should be fully prepared and choose an opportune time to reorganize the monetary system. The current special monetary systems in Northeast China, Taiwan, and Xinjiang should also be reorganized at the same time to achieve uniformity.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: (None)</p>
<p>Original Plan (4) Strengthen control over foreign exchange and absorb remittances from overseas Chinese to enrich foreign exchange funds.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: The Central Bank should earnestly perform its duties in accordance with the Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange. For commodities imported with official foreign exchange rates, it should also jointly check their sales situation and selling prices with the competent authorities.

The Import and Export Management Committee should earnestly handle the issuance of import licenses and the promotion of exports in accordance with the law and report to the competent department for verification on a monthly basis.

<p>Conclusion of Implementation Measures of the Economic Plan</p>
<p>The conclusion of the economic reform plan states that the following three points should be paid special attention to in order to smoothly promote this plan: 1. Reasonably resolve the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers so that they can maintain the minimum necessary life, so that administrative efficiency can be improved. 2. State-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be on an equal footing and should not be discriminated against. In particular, special treatment should not be given to some private enterprises, which would increase the difficulties of legitimate private businesses. 3. A broad economic construction movement should be launched in the social sphere to increase public understanding and interest in the economy, and the difficulties of economic construction should be overcome with the strength of officer-soldier cooperation.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: Given that prices are soaring without end, the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers should be adjusted monthly based on the cost of living index, and important daily necessities should be distributed to stabilize their lives first, and then administrative efficiency can be improved and poverty and corruption can be eradicated. The Law on the Management of State-owned Enterprises is in the process of being legislated. Article 5 of its draft states that "Unless otherwise specifically provided by the laws of state-owned enterprises, they shall have the same rights and obligations as similar private enterprises," which clearly stipulates that state-owned and private enterprises are on an equal footing. The government should treat private enterprises equally and should not give special treatment to any part. The country will be divided into several economic regions based on natural and economic conditions, gathering local scholars, experienced professionals, or leaders from various occupational groups and society, and administrative supervisors, closely forming economic construction counseling associations, launching economic construction movements in each region, based on this program and targeting the current economic crisis and making it the basis for reform. Everyone should work together to follow the various implementation measures of the plan and promote them to all economic regions, provinces, and cities. Also, institutions should be set up to increase the promotion of the economic movement.</p>

<h3>The Communist Party Uses Strikes as a Weapon to Resist the Marshall Plan. The British Foreign Office Publishes the Contents of "M Directive"</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch] The British Foreign Office recently released the so-called "M Directive," which includes the German Communist Party's secret plan to organize strikes and sabotage the transportation system in the Ruhr region. A Foreign Office spokesman said that, based on continued intelligence, the British Foreign Office is increasingly convinced of the truth of the directive. The directive stated that this winter will be a decisive period in the history of German labor. Continuing the fight and contacting the working class throughout Europe can conquer the key positions of production. This battle is the starting point for the final struggle to win the liberation of the world proletariat and a prerequisite for achieving the final victory. In order to maintain the discipline of comrades and use all the weapons of the proletariat, the socialist homeland, the Soviet Union, will support this battle and do its best to resist the monopoly of capitalism. The Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade will coordinate the common battle of various socialist movements in Europe. Although the German Communist Party is not yet a member of the Bureau, it will gain a major position in the next battle. The working classes of all countries will provide necessary assistance, and the task of the German Communist Party is to use this assistance to achieve the best results. The main goal of the winter battle is to defeat the offensive of monopoly capitalism through the so-called Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Resolution Contains Five Parts: Focus on the Ruhr Area as the Center of Struggle, Organize a General Strike Starting This March</h3>
<p>After careful consideration, our comrades have established the following resolution:</p>
<p>"Part One": The center of the people's struggle is the Ruhr area, its production, and the transportation system of West and North Germany. For technical reasons, the comrades in charge should not be at the forefront during the outbreak of the strike. However, in accordance with "Plan R," the workers' strike should be launched simultaneously in transportation and production sectors. Transportation unions and metalworkers' unions will strike successively, but the Communist Party must avoid direct participation. Based on past experience, Ruhr workers enjoy privileges superior to other workers and may refuse to strike. At this time, transportation workers should bear a significant responsibility. The Bremen-Düsseldorf railway and the Hamburg-Bielefeld railway are particularly important. The strike center for transportation workers is Dortmund. The strike in Essen should not be too conspicuous, otherwise, the entire plan will be affected. Reliable reports indicate that military authorities are prepared with reserve transportation workers to deploy when transportation strikes occur. Therefore, we must monitor all important routes and do our best to prevent the smooth progress of transportation. Our goal is not to completely block food transportation but to delay its arrival at its destination. The delay of food transportation and the strike of production industries are the main parts of our plan. Comrades Lauer, Behlert, Siegmund, and Kraski are already in pre-arranged positions. The same principle should apply to other West German strikes, that is, to unite the entire working class.</p>
<p>"Part Two": From an organizational point of view, the focus is on the metalworkers' union. What cannot be ignored here is obtaining or at least controlling the various assets of the union. The unity of the working class must be completed immediately. The special task is to find weaknesses in the organization and exploit them. Comrades Honisch, Trab, Gabrowski, Lewisch, Krausenhan, and Kroh have been granted the authority of the executive committee to launch the Ruhr area campaign.</p>
<p>"Part Three": Propaganda work should be unified under the command of the Central Executive Committee. Its goals are as follows: The Marshall Plan is a slave plan of American monopoly capitalists; The strikes in various monopoly capitalist countries are a symbol of the accelerating decline of capitalist society; The East European economy, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, is making positive progress. Here, we should consider the ban on West German Communist Party newspapers. Therefore, we should use radio and postal networks to ensure the circulation of propaganda materials. Riot cadres No. 7, 11, and 14 are responsible for publicizing the significance of referendums and public ownership of enterprises in the Ruhr area. The unity of the working class can be promoted through referendum propaganda.</p>
<p>"Part Four": Timeline: Complete the common foundation of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party before the end of December to realize the referendum; Complete the organization of strike cadres before February; Organize a general strike starting from the beginning of March.</p>
<p>"Part Five": Supervision work is the responsibility of the MA cadres. All comrades should strictly follow the orders of the cadres.</p>

<h3>Left-Wing Parliamentarians Attack Katayama, Plan to Force Cabinet to Collapse, Socialist Party Congress Will Decide Fate of Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Political sources in Japan stated on the 17th that the result of the four-day National Congress of the Japan Socialist Democratic Party, which opens on the 19th, will determine the fate of the Katayama Cabinet. Even if the left-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party can force Katayama to step down, they will turn to the right rather than the left afterward.</p>
<p>The Socialist Democratic Party held its second day of the Congress on the 17th, with 700 representatives from all over the country in attendance. Six left-wing members launched a massive attack on Prime Minister Katayama. They sharply criticized the current government for its poor implementation of social policies and stated that if it is said that the government is constrained by the four-party policy agreement formed 18 months ago due to the organization of a coalition government, then they should immediately dissolve the four-party coalition. The left-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party account for about half of the party. They adopt a two-pronged tactic: First, seize the important party positions of the Katayama faction; second, force the party to abandon the four-party agreement. Well-informed political observers believe that if the second plan succeeds, the foundation of the Katayama Cabinet will collapse, and the Cabinet will inevitably collapse. If so, it is generally predicted that Katayama will decide to suddenly dissolve the parliament and hold a re-election. Since the left-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party only account for half of the party's power in parliament, the election results will inevitably lead to conservative candidates being elected as the new prime minister with an overwhelming advantage. The left-wing is trying to prevent Katayama from continuing to serve as chairman of the Executive Committee and plans to replace the right-wing with left-wing Kato as secretary-general.</p>
<h3>Japanese Daycare Centers Kill Infants Without Bloodshed to Defraud Milk and Sugar Rations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] The police announced today that more than a hundred infant deaths have occurred at a daycare center run by Mrs. Ishikawa, possibly including the children of military personnel.

Each infant costs 5,000 to 8,000 yen, and the parents will not be allowed to reclaim them in the future. The center then secretly kills them to defraud the government of special rations of milk and sugar for infants and the deceased, and resell them on the market to make money. The Japanese people pride themselves on treating children with kindness and love, but this news has aroused indignation, and it is even more sensational than other crimes after the war.</p>
<h3>American PhD Predicts That Epidemics Will Invade the World</h3>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Students' United Association for Rescuing the National Crisis and Protesting the Kowloon Atrocities held a demonstration outside the British Consulate in Shanghai yesterday to protest the Hong Kong police's demolition of houses in Kowloon City. Participating schools included more than 70 universities and middle schools, including Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Fudan University, St. John's University, Soochow University, Zhijiang University, Hujiang University, Guanghua University, Daxia University, Aurora University, Datong University, Shanghai Maritime College, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Drama School, Shanghai Normal School, Shanghai Technical College, Shanghai Business School, Shanghai Fine Arts School, Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School, Chinese Science College, New China College of Commerce, Chuning Middle School, Shenlian Middle School, Jinyuan Middle School, Shanghai North Middle School, China Women's Middle School, Xizhen Women's Middle School, Huashi Middle School, Guangzhao Women's Middle School, Zhengguang Middle School, Jiuyang Middle School, Shanghai No. 1 Women's Middle School, Minli Women's Middle School, Chengyi Middle School, Nanyang Model High School, Nanyang Girls' Middle School, Shaoxing Middle School, Jiancheng Middle School, Zhirenyong Middle School, Junyi Middle School, Qixiu Middle School, Aiqun Middle School, Bethel Middle School, Zhongzheng Middle School, Huamo Middle School, Fuxia Middle School, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, and Tongji Affiliated Middle School, with more than 20,000 students.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the consulate was closed as usual in the afternoon. When the students arrived, the consulate staff had already left. To prevent accidents, the city government had previously sent Police Chief Lu Dagong and police to protect the consulate and had the gate closed tightly.</p>
<p>The students from each school divided into northwest and southeast areas and began to form teams to walk or take vehicles at 12:30, gathering continuously in front of the Bund Park Square. Along the way through Nanjing Road and Zhongzheng East Road, they posted slogans, chanted slogans, or sang songs protesting the atrocities. Patriotic emotions were high and enthusiastic, but the order was well-maintained. Passersby stopped to watch, and the road was temporarily blocked. The students responsible for propaganda first went to the consulate to post slogans, and several representatives negotiated with Section Chief Lu, requesting the opening of the consulate gate so that students could enter and deliver a letter of protest to the British consul in person. After Lu explained in polite terms that the consulate staff was not in the consulate, he said that the letter of protest could be left behind and he would forward it on their behalf. Then, the student group went to the front of the consulate at 2:55, and traffic to and from was completely cut off. The students were unable to enter the consulate and shouted slogans outside, and the situation was once tense.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Bureau Chief Yu Arrive One After the Other</p>
<p>Then the students proposed to remove the British flag hanging in the consulate and replace it with the national flag. Wu Zhendong from Jiaotong University, Lin Shide from Tongji University, and four others were immediately elected as representatives to hold it and negotiate with Lu. They initially argued with the police on the scene for a long time, but after the earnest explanation of Bureau Chief Yu and others that this was a violation of international law, their request was not granted. The representatives immediately went out and reported the results of the negotiations to the crowd of students gathered at the gate. All the students expressed satisfaction and left in applause and shouts of slogans. At that time, Mayor Wu also rushed to the British Consulate. Seeing that the atmosphere had already eased, he lingered briefly and then dispersed separately. The police bureau dispatched additional police along the way to protect them, and the order was good.</p>
<p>[Another report] The faculty, staff, and students of Hujiang University and Great China University issued a declaration yesterday regarding the Kowloon City incident. All faculty and staff of the National Shanghai Medical College sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Wang, asking him to argue with the British government on the basis of reason to calm public outrage.</p>

<h3>Kowloon City House Demolition Incident: General Labour Union Issues Two-Point Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the Hong Kong police's forceful demolition of civilian houses in Kowloon City, the Municipal General Labour Union held a special executive council meeting yesterday and resolved to issue a two-point statement: (1) To request the government to adopt a firm diplomatic stance and promptly prevent the expansion of the unfortunate Kowloon City incident, and strive for a satisfactory resolution.

The letter stated, "The funds were voluntarily and enthusiastically donated by these elementary school students. Some donated 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, others 2,000 to 1,000 yuan, and even 500 yuan. Everyone was eager and enthusiastic, unanimously expressing their indignation at the Kowloon incident. Furthermore, we hope that compatriots across the country can hold widespread donations and contribute their mite to help the compatriots in Kowloon who have been displaced for the sake of fighting for national sovereignty."</p>
<p>The staff of this newspaper, in addition to respecting the wishes of the students of the school and finding a way to remit the funds, also expresses our gratitude for the national consciousness and humanitarianism demonstrated by the elementary school students.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Bravely Captures Thief: A Second Fails Cunningly. The Garden Hotel: All Captured in One Net.</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 1:30 AM on the 6th, three thieves from Dongdan used the excuse of needing hot water to knock on the door of the Wanshengyuan Hot Water Store at No. 606. Brandishing pistols, they first tricked the owner, Wan Sheng, into the second door. One thief guarded the storefront, and two thieves went upstairs, opened the cabinet door, and looted six large and small gold rings, a pair of gold earrings, a gold iron bar, two gold clocks, more than one hundred nickel coins, and 2 million legal tender. They also snatched the wife's gold ring and other items. After about 30 minutes, they left and fled.</p>
<p>Hu Yingfang (16 years old) tracked them downstairs, shouting "Thieves!" However, it was midnight, there were few pedestrians, and no one responded. She chased them to the outside of No. 509 Haimen Road and saw a man standing there holding a bicycle. One thief jumped on the rear rack of the bicycle, about to flee together, when the bicycle suddenly fell to the ground. She immediately stepped forward and captured the thief, but was still unable to hold him due to her small size and lack of strength. She only managed to grab a wool hat left behind by the thief. She then turned around and grabbed the person holding the bicycle. The person immediately said, "I am A Er, don't you recognize me?" Upon closer inspection, it was indeed someone she knew. At this time, the thief took the opportunity to escape. After returning home, she repeatedly wondered if A Er was suspicious. So, the next morning she went to test the waters. Unexpectedly, A Er became furious, accusing her of insulting him and demanding compensation for reputational damage. Both sides clashed and were brought to the branch bureau. According to A Er, his name is Zhou Jinsheng, a coppersmith. That night, he had just returned home after bathing with friends at the Xinyuan Bathhouse and was passing by the area. He knew nothing about the theft. After repeated questioning by the police, A Er knew that he could no longer deny it and admitted to being an accomplice, and pointed out that the weapons and stolen goods of his accomplices were hidden in Room 464 of the Garden Hotel on Zhejiang Road. Squad Leader Ma ordered Squad Member Li to lead police officers Gao Yong'an and Zhang Kechang to rush to the scene. Accomplices Bao Chengtong, Xu Dihui, and Chen Tuyuan were apprehended on the spot. A revolver, ten bullets, two fake pistols, and stolen goods, including a pair of gold earrings and more than seventy nickel coins, were seized. Personnel were dispatched to remain on guard, and accomplices Ren Jianwei and Zhang Meiding were subsequently apprehended. After verifying the facts, they will be transferred to the court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang-Chengdu Middle School Massacre: Deng Qirong Suffers Dozens of Stab Wounds; Principal Offender Zhang Huidong Under Strict Interrogation; Large-Scale Assassination Organization Discovered Among Students</h3>
<p>[Report from Chengdu on the 10th] Zhejiang-Chengdu Middle School, located outside Chengdu, held its school sports day on the 3rd. Student Deng Qirong, after completing the 200-meter race, was invited by another classmate to talk outside the school. Less than a hundred steps outside the school, on the riverbank, more than twenty young men, resembling both students and vagrants, suddenly emerged from the roadside, wielding sharp knives and stabbing Deng all over his body. He suffered dozens of injuries on the spot, covered in blood, and barely breathing. The vagrants were about to throw Deng into the river when his classmates heard the sound and rushed out. The vagrants then dispersed in all directions. Afterwards, Deng was admitted to West China Union University Hospital for treatment, and the Provincial Capital Police Bureau launched an investigation. On the 6th, Zhang Huidong, the principal offender who invited Deng out, was arrested. He is a senior high school student at the school. According to Zhang Huidong's confession to the Judicial Section of the bureau: "Deng was the chairman of the student self-government association and also a member of the school basketball team. Last week, Deng asked Zhang to return the school-issued basketball uniform, and Zhang harbored resentment, and the intention to kill arose." Zhang also confessed: "The murderers of Deng were members of an assassination group within the student community. He (Zhang) is also a member of the group. This organization is large-scale, with more than a thousand members, all students from various schools in Chengdu. Their usual actions and targets have a certain pattern. The targets of assassinations are mostly classmates, and their arrangements are very planned and organized." The police bureau has, based on this confession, worked with the Department of Education to conduct a thorough investigation, and will crack the entire organization in the short term, and severely punish the participating students in order to rectify the academic atmosphere and maintain the rule of law. The murdered Deng usually abided by school rules. His eldest brother, Qiding, is currently an editor in the Provincial Government Legal Affairs Office. His second brother, Qiyu, is currently studying at MIT in the United States. Deng's knife wounds penetrated his intestines and stomach, and his life is in critical condition.</p>

<h3>New Situation in the Pacification of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Report from Huaiyin on the 12th] Along with the passage of ruthless years, the pacification work in Northern Jiangsu has spent another dull year of 1947 under the principle of "avoiding main force battles" by the communist bandits. Reviewing the pacification work of the past year, there has indeed never been a fierce battle fought in Northern Jiangsu. However, we can draw a conclusion that as long as we encounter the main force of the bandit army, the national army can always fight a genuine victory and reap fruitful results. The Battle of Sujiazu in August, the Battle of Suining in October, the Battle of Wulizhuang and Qianjiaji in November, and the battles north of Siyang in December are all good examples.</p>
<p>Especially from Christmas last year to the New Year this year, in just a few days, the national army's suppression troops presented the people of Northern Jiangsu with a grand gift in the form of a great harvest on the Tongyu line. The battle process that has expanded the pacification situation in Northern Jiangsu is as follows: The "Heaven, Earth, and Man" divisions of the national army, led personally by Division Commander Wang, advanced from Dongtai, practicing the first step in the large-scale suppression plan formulated by Zhang Xuezhong, Commander of the Huaihai Pacification District. Guan Wenwei, the highest commander of the Northern Jiangsu communist bandits, said in their cadre meeting after the Battle of Libao: "The Battle of Libao was a minor victory, and in the future, we will fight a major victory for you to see." So he placed all the main forces of the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns, which he rarely used, on the line from Wuyou to Biancang. This is an</p>
<p>excellent opportunity</p>
<p>undoubtedly for the national army. For a year, the main force of the suppression army has only encountered one regiment or one brigade, and has not been able to thoroughly suppress them. This time they have sent all their limited main force to our door. This kind of opportunity is really too rare. In the bandits' thinking, they know that the national army's strength in Northern Jiangsu is not very large. If they can eliminate all the suppression troops this time, they can drive south and directly attack Jiangnan, and attempt to do something in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>The battle began at 5:00 PM on the 26th, with Biancang and Baijiaxiang (three li south of Wuyou) as the core,展开猛烈的战斗. The bandits used a successive attack method, increasing three regiments of troops every day. When the battle first started on the 26th, the bandits' combat troops were only 10,000 men. By the 27th, it increased to more than 20,000, and on the 28th, it increased to more than 30,000. On the 29th, they took out all sixteen regiments of their main force, and the battle reached its climax.</p>
<p>Commander Zhang Xuezhong had convened the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Meeting in Zhenjiang, and rushed to Huaiyin in the afternoon of the 28th. From the 28th onwards, for two days and nights, he</p>
<p>did not sleep, wholeheartedly commanding the frontline battle.</p>
<p>At this time, in order to implement the determination to wipe out the main force of the bandits, the national army sent another batch of elite troops from Dongtai to participate in the battle, and a large number of air force also came to assist. In addition, the national army departing from between Lianghuai arrived at Donggou Yilin, and a certain brigade of the garrison in Funing also began to move south, completing a three-sided encirclement deployment.</p>
<p>After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandits' elite Thirty-second and Thirty-fifth Brigades were defeated. After suffering 15,000 casualties, the bandits retreated their routed remnants to their old nest of Hede Town on the afternoon of the 30th. After waiting for a</p>
<p>new deployment to be completed, the national army will really attack their nest.</p>
<p>The reporter recently met with Commander Zhang Yunzhong at the command headquarters of the Pacification District. He was sitting next to the telephone, and during his busy command, he analyzed the cause and effect of this battle to the reporter with an excited expression. He said: "The main force of the bandits has lost more than half of its strength in this battle. The burden of the pacification work in Northern Jiangsu will be greatly reduced in the future."</p>
<p>The main force of the bandit army left in Northern Jiangsu is actually only the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns. However, for a year, they have always responded to the national army's suppression with a wandering method, so that the pacification work cannot smoothly reach the ideal state. This major blow to the bandit army's main force is undoubtedly a turning point for the pacification work in Northern Jiangsu in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, another obstacle to the pacification work is the inability to effectively coordinate military and government affairs. On this point, in the</p>
<p>Six-Province Joint Defense Conference two months ago, there was an important decision, which is: The Pacification District will be supervised by the Provincial Chairman in the future, and the commander of the Pacification District has absolute command over the commissioners and county magistrates within his jurisdiction. Therefore, the commander of the Pacification District is lower in name, but his powers have been expanded, and therefore military-government coordination can be further strengthened.</p>
<p>The Huaihai Pacification District, under the leadership of General Zhang Xuezhong, has been decided by the highest military authorities to be expanded and reorganized into the Seventh Pacification District, and its jurisdiction has also been expanded to the Longhai Line. Starting from the New Year, after a week of intense work,</p>
<p>the Seventh Pacification District</p>
<p>has been reorganized. And it has been decided that a pacification meeting will be convened in a few days - on the 12th, at which the commissioners and county magistrates within the jurisdiction, the party secretaries, the speakers of the council, and the commanders of the troops above the regimental level will come to Huaiyin to attend and discuss the grand plan for the pacification of Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>A series of news has told every person in Northern Jiangsu that the situation in Northern Jiangsu will have a decisive development in the short term. Millions of people yearning for rule are welcoming this new situation with a feeling of unparalleled excitement!</p>

It is said that this transitional measure can be decided whether to implement it after the chairman of the committee, Yuan Liang, returns to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Also, the association, in response to requests from various guilds, has extended the registration deadline for yarn and cloth merchants and replication merchants to next Monday.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Gains in Price</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market condition was that the price had fallen sharply for days, and at the beginning, the client gang came to absorb at low prices, and this street was also slightly active, and the asking price turned firm. Afterwards, it was reported that the unified tax on cotton yarn was increased by more than 10%, and people's minds were particularly strong. Forty-two branches of Blue Phoenix fine yarn rushed out of the 60 million mark in the middle of the way, reaching 60.2 million yuan. At that time, colleagues who were in trouble with funds took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the market rebounded again. But in the end, compared with the previous day, the price increased by 1.2 million yuan, to 59.5 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns rose by 500,000 to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Fine Cloth Rises</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the morning opening was due to the easing of monetary policy, floating [omitted word] compensation, new buying activities, customers from Taiwan, Hankou, Ningbo and other gangs, slightly absorbed, but the strength faction still sold at high prices. But as a result of the touting from all sides, the price of various grades of 12-pound fine cloth rose from 12,000 to 45,000 yuan compared with the previous day. In addition, [omitted word] bleached cloth, straight tribute, Shilin cloth, etc., also rose by more than 10,000 to about 100,000, while other coarse cloth twills, etc., showed mixed ups and downs.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 14,160 pieces. There were 351 applications, and 7 were from manufacturers, purchasing 280 pieces of cloth. [Omitted name] cloth shops purchased the rest.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market situation continued to weaken. The opening price of Textile Construction was too low, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell lightly, so no transaction was heard. Colleagues, due to the extraordinarily tight monetary policy, and the relationship on Saturday, there were not enough staff in the afternoon, so transactions were scarce. 120 bales were traded, with the factory price being 4.96 million for Kaitongzhou fine velvet, the warehouse price being 5.111 million for Ling [omitted word], and 1.06 million for Zhoupu seed cotton, down 70,000.</p>
<h3>China Textile Company Announces December Production</h3>
<p>The Statistics Office of the Textile Construction Company yesterday announced the operating and production figures of the various textile factories in Shanghai for December of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947): A total of 44,867,955 spindles were operated day and night, producing a total of 36,297 pieces of yarn, an increase of 2.4% compared to the previous month. A total of 758,002 looms were operated throughout the month, producing a total of 773,747 pieces of cloth, an increase of 1.2% compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the increase in production, the person in charge of the company's Statistics Office said that it was due to the use of self-provided generators to supplement electricity. If there are no other obstacles this month, the production figures can be increased again.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Exchanged for Rayon; The Ministries of Agriculture, Economy, and Finance Plan to Implement Measures</p>
<p>Regarding the exchange of raw silk for rayon, the Silk Coordination Association recently received an instruction from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry: "The Secretariat of the Full Economic Council has issued a letter stating that regarding the export of silk in exchange for rayon, the Council has reviewed and discussed it and made six suggestions in principle: (1) For the purpose of increasing production and improving [omitted word] silk, continue to promote the [omitted word] silk production and sales plan, (2) Use the foreign exchange obtained from the export of raw silk to [omitted word] rayon and allocate it to various [omitted word] [omitted word], (3) The [omitted word] progress and distribution of rayon will be supervised by the Import and Export Committee in conjunction with the China Trust Bureau, (4) Use the surplus of rayon to subsidize production costs, (5) If there is still a surplus after subsidizing production costs, allocate it as much as possible to improve and reward [omitted word] silk, (6) A portion of the rayon allocated should be woven into export silk to earn foreign exchange. The detailed implementation measures above will be formulated by the Ministries of Agriculture, Economy, and Finance, and have been submitted to the 25th plenary meeting of the Full Economic Council for resolution, and passed in accordance with the review opinions, so the Council should jointly formulate detailed measures with the China Silk Company and submit them to the Ministry for approval." It is heard that after receiving the order, the Association has already [omitted word] Lingli and is formulating [them].</p>
<h3>Rayon Slightly Firm; Silk Goods Do Not Fluctuate Much</h3>
<p>Rayon was slightly firm yesterday. The opening price of No. 120 Asahi Shinny was 92 million yuan, and there was a transaction. Monetary policy was slightly loose, and there was a slight decrease in appetite. The closing price was 5 million yuan for the Zhouyi period. In the afternoon trading, the opening price was 4 million yuan, which was 3 million yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory Yarn</p>
<p>The market was quiet yesterday, and transactions were scarce. Only Gao Ye [omitted word] traded two or three packages, with the spot price being 3 million yuan, and the three-day period being 5 million yuan. There were few transactions in the five-dan heads of various grades, and the asking price was slightly firmer than the previous day. Qianjing had no transactions, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>The market was slightly firm yesterday. Huajiang Zhen [omitted word] was opened at around 9.8 million yuan, and supply and demand were relatively balanced. The up and down was slight. The closing price was 40.1 million yuan for the spot period and 1.2 million yuan for the Zhouyi period. The afternoon market was softer, at around 800,000 [omitted word]. Huajin crepe was still at 70,000 yuan, and other [omitted word], crepe, Dawei ni, etc., were stable and unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Dyeing and Weaving Industry of One City and Five Counties: A Joint Meeting Convened Today, Aiming for Unity Among Businesses in Response to National Policies</h3>
<p>The dyeing and weaving industry of Shanghai and the five counties of Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, and Wuxian, owns more than 40,000 looms, accounting for more than eight-tenths of the national cotton yarn replication production equipment. Recently, due to the unified purchase and distribution by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, a meeting is scheduled to be held in this city today (the 18th) to discuss response methods. More than sixty or seventy principal persons in charge of local trade associations have reported to the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Trade Association. At noon today, they will convene at the Wenqi Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School in Minhang Town, and at 6 p.m., there will be a social dinner at the International Hotel. According to its spokesperson, the previous yarn allocation system was imperfect. Factories that were excluded still have to rely on the black market for yarn. Since the government began selling yarn in the market, the situation has improved slightly. However, due to insufficient yarn factory production, replication and turnover are difficult. Currently, no more than half of the businesses in various places are operating. The loss of work and time is regrettable. The cloth produced by one city and five counties has always been the general hub for supplying the whole country. If it is disrupted, the supply in various places will be even more worrying. Effective measures will be discussed at this meeting to submit to the government. The spokesperson also pointed out that the authorities are currently handling the registration of replication factories, and the deadline is pressing. Some businesses have not had time to complete the registration. The trade association has already submitted reasons and requested an extension. If the request is not granted, how will these manufacturers excluded from the control line survive? It is a significant issue. It is said that when the government previously handled registration, the excessive number of required documents and the tight deadline caused some factories that were actually in production to not be able to complete the registration in time and were unable to obtain yarn allocation.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Weak, Oil Market Rebounds Universally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 11,700 stones of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Credit was tight, digestion was still sluggish, and the market continued to weaken. Japonica rice for early and thin rice was cut by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, indica rice fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and white medium and sub-quality rice continued to fall by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour opened sharply lower in the morning, rallied at noon, and ended down more than 10,000 yuan. Bran saw a sharp drop of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan but was also firm at the close.</p>
<p>Bean cake transactions were active in Xiamen, and rural areas were slightly active, rebounding by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean sales sentiment turned firm, digestion was slightly active, and rebounded by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Mung beans gradually showed signs of recovery, with prices stable in name but firm in reality. Adzuki beans were sluggish, and broad beans rose slightly by 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas temporarily formed a stable pattern. Red sorghum arrivals and sales were both slow, and prices did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Corn reappeared for sale at high prices in Beiyang, turning firm after weakness, soaring by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Sesame supply and demand were balanced, with little price fluctuation for both black and white sesame, but milk sesame was firm by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had acceptable sales, rebounding by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After a sharp drop in the oil market, stores and stomachs turned strong, taking advantage of the low prices. All oils rebounded uniformly, with soybean oil, raw oil, and rapeseed oil successively rising by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Shipped North</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Qimei Wheel, loaded with more than 1,000 tons of rice, sailed to Qingdao yesterday. Zhixin Wheel, loaded with 2,300 tons of flour and groceries, also sailed to Qingdao. Huangxing Wheel, loaded with 2,000 tons of rice, sailed to Tianjin today. Lingge Wheel, loaded with more than 167,000 bags of flour, will also be shipped to Tianjin today. Hanmin Wheel, loaded with a total of 1,900 tons of rice and flour, is scheduled to be shipped to Tianjin on the 20th. Also, Zhong Yi No. 104 is also loaded with 500 tons of flour and will be shipped to Tianjin on the 20th.</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: The Fred Olsen Line's *Clitania*, chartered by Fook Lai Shipping Company, carrying 190,000 bags of flour from Australia to Shanghai, was repeatedly delayed due to bad weather before arriving in Shanghai. According to the company yesterday, it is scheduled to be imported today and berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf. The flour was reported and loaded by the Ministry of Communications Storage and Transportation Bureau.</p>
<h3>Rental Income Tax: Landlords Request Tax on Actual Income</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Banking, Trust, and Real Estate Trade Association previously withheld property rental income tax on behalf of entrusted lease management companies. Landlords have claimed that prices have been high recently, and general rents cannot increase in proportion to prices. Profits from renting and buying are limited to 10% of actual expenditures, and the income of landlords is very small. Furthermore, due to contractual relationships, rents cannot be arbitrarily increased unilaterally within a certain period, and some even suffer losses. If taxes are levied based on income, it will impose an excessive burden on landlords and be unfair. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the Ministry of Finance, requesting taxation based on actual income and requesting an explanation of the reporting and calculation standards. The Ministry of Finance has already approved, stating that the property rental income tax is based on actual rental income as the object of taxation. The various expenses that should be deducted when calculating income should be handled in accordance with the tax law. The association should inform its members to handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>Soap Prices Rise</p>
<p>The household soap market has been silent since the state's allocation news subsided. The sharp declines in the previous days led to manufacturers actively buying. As a result, both the Guben and Arrow soaps rebounded by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and Huang Xiangmao also rose by 25,000 yuan. The market for the remaining Guanghua and Meili soaps was firm. Old-brand Meili Phoenix matches rose by 200,000 yuan, while miscellaneous brands remained weak.</p>
<p>Tea Market Quiet</p>
<p>Domestic tea sales remained strong due to continued consumption by this street and various gangs. As for export tea, exporters continued to hold back, and the market remained quiet, while prices rose uniformly. The reason is that dealers, seeing that market inventories are exhausted, have intensified their efforts to hoard and raise prices. By the close of the market, prices had risen across the board. However, some varieties remained firm due to the quality of the goods, with the situation appearing stable on the surface but quietly firm underneath.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Fall</h3>
<p>Government bonds yesterday saw an expansion of the rising trend, frequently reaching new highs, due to the arrival of our delegation in Washington and renewed speculation about the currency system. Tongbing opened at 60,000 yuan and rose to 94,000 yuan before retreating to around 85,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi rose by 2,100, Bing rose by 2,500, Ding rose by 2,000 yuan, and Wu Hao rose by 2,200, with a transaction volume of approximately 6 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were weak yesterday due to unexpected events in Guangzhou and renewed anxiety, coupled with the Shanghai telegram rising to 3.4 yuan. Jardine Spinning opened at 545,000 yuan, fell to 530,000 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Guangdong securities brokers and retail investors were slightly active. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Spinning, paper, shipping, Changche, telephone, and Xiangtai stocks each fell by half a percent, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Sellers Repeatedly Dump, Chinese Stocks Firm Then Weaken</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were in good spirits yesterday, but young bulls took advantage of the high prices to take profits. Amid renewed reports of long positions in Guangdong stocks in Hong Kong, sellers repeatedly dumped, and credit remained tight, leading to a firm then weak trend. Small-cap stocks were briefly popular but later collapsed.</p>
<p>The morning opening saw both gains and losses. Wing On Spinning debuted at 750 yuan for immediate delivery and 785 yuan for deferred delivery, rising to highs of 770 yuan and 802 yuan after opening. Among the small-cap stocks, the three hot stocks showed renewed vitality, with Xinguang rising the fastest. However, selling pressure was very strong, with interest rates opening high at 28.5 cents and 23 cents. Hong Kong Electric reported a long position of 3.4 yuan, and there were rumors of US loans. Wing On Spinning gradually fell to lows of 718 yuan and 752 yuan, before being pulled back up to 728 yuan and 760 yuan. The situation then hovered without much change. The noon close was 721 yuan and 756 yuan. After falling to the limit, Huaxin rebounded. Compared to the previous close, immediate delivery stocks saw Zhongfang rise slightly, Matches, Wuhe, and Shangping were flat, Meiya fell by 10%, and Xinhe, Huayu, Zhongfa, Xinhua, Rongyu, Tongyi, Zhongsishangwu, and Neiyi all fell by half a percent, with the rest falling slightly. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Meiya fell by 10%, Huayu, Jingfu, and Xinhe fell by half a percent, and Qin Xing saw little trading but rose by half a percent. Xinguang and Wing On Spinning fell slightly. Off-exchange unlisted stocks also saw more selling than buying due to tight credit.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Trading Halts Due to the Impact of Tongzhongji's Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>The sugar market suddenly halted trading yesterday morning. Since Tongzhongji's bankruptcy, the matter has not yet been resolved. Creditors convened an emergency meeting and unanimously agreed that brokers should also be held responsible. After the meeting, they reported to the authorities, who summoned several brokers. The brokers, however, believed that their commission income was minimal (700 yuan per bag) and that they could not bear this heavy responsibility. Therefore, they voluntarily suspended trading from yesterday to discuss a proper solution.</p>
<h3>Price Evaluation Council Adjusts Kerosene Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The 17th meeting of the Price Evaluation Council's Fuel Subgroup decided to adjust kerosene prices to 5.87 million yuan per barrel (53 gallons) and 720,000 yuan per can, with a retail price of 18,000 yuan per liter. Approved by Director Wu, the new prices will take effect from the 19th of this month.</p>

The coal will be shipped to Qingdao for delivery in four months, and the cotton cloth and cotton yarn will be shipped to the co-op for delivery in proportion to the arrival of the Taiwan coal. The coal price is calculated at 2.5 million yuan per ton in national currency.</p>

<h3>End-of-Year Musings</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The old year is ending, and the New Year is almost here.</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year has just passed, but in the minds of most people, the Lunar New Year is the true New Year. This may be a deeply ingrained habit that cannot be changed in a short time. However, the Lunar New Year does have many ritualistic embellishments that are reminiscent of religion, making it difficult for people to easily forget. After entering the twentieth day of the twelfth lunar month, there is a series of New Year festivals, such as sending off the Kitchen God, welcoming the Kitchen God, making cakes, doing a major cleaning, and eating New Year's Eve dinner. On New Year's Eve, everyone is extremely nervous, and everyone seems to have a special feeling. Although everyone knows that it is just another event, no one can escape tradition. However, precisely because of this, the profound power of a nation's customs and habits is manifested.</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year lacks the backdrop of customs and traditions, so although it is a national holiday, there is little tension. I remember that when the government first announced the implementation of the Gregorian New Year, the police authorities in the capital once ordered merchants not to close during the Lunar New Year. As a result, the order was withdrawn after considering the difficulty of changing public sentiment. Although the Lunar New Year still occupies an unofficial status, it has gained widespread recognition under the name of Spring Festival.</p>
<p>Amid the promotion of frugality, it is not very reasonable to have two New Years in less than two months. However, as long as the agricultural society in our country has not changed, the Lunar New Year will probably have to continue. Westerners celebrate Christmas and then the New Year, while we prepare for the Lunar New Year after sending off the Kitchen God. Although the methods are different, they are all customs and habits of the same nation.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the customs and habits of a nation should cater to the global trend. In other words, customs and habits should strive for progress and aspire to reach the ultimate goal of a high degree of unification of human culture and civilization. This is certainly an undeniable view. So-called customs and habits and national culture are not fixed and immutable because whether it is customs and habits or cultural traditions, they are all the result of a certain way of life, and although lifestyles do not change all the time, they are rich in changeability.</p>
<p>Now, when we encounter the New Year and festivals, although we still maintain many traditional rituals, they are much diluted compared to ten or twenty years ago. This is partly because the people's livelihood is difficult, and everyone is no longer interested, and partly because we have been influenced by higher world cultures.</p>
<p>Although culture is an abstract thing, its influence can be seen and felt over time. For example, Christmas, one of the cultures of Christianity, has gradually become a fixed program in Chinese urban society. Conversely, our old-fashioned holidays are gradually being diluted. Even in daily life, the influence of Western lifestyle culture is eroding our traditional habits.</p>
<p>You may say that this is our progress, and it is not impossible because Western lifestyle culture does have many places that are more reasonable than our inherent ones, but sometimes you feel a little melancholy. Although you know that what you are getting now is perhaps more valuable than what you have lost, you still feel a sense of loss. You feel that this psychological feeling cannot be explained by simple nostalgia. Nostalgia may be inevitable, but your sadness is actually deeper than this.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not surprising. Because the new lifestyle culture that we are now accepting is just old wine in a new wineskin. Although the packaging is changing, the content is not only the same as before but is also corroding. Wine is certainly better the older it gets, but although a nation's lifestyle culture must also undergo a fermentation process, it is certainly not better the older it gets. The reason why we have to bow our heads to higher foreign cultures is proof of this. Real wine has nothing to do with the vessel in which it is stored, but a lifestyle culture brewed from life must have a consistent relationship between appearance and reality.</p>
<p>I am not saying that inherent lifestyle habits should not be abolished, but that a nation's lifestyle culture should cultivate new life from its own blood. The Lunar New Year and the Gregorian New Year are just forms. Only by creating new content can we finally decide all forms of life.</p>
<h3>Retired Teachers</h3>
<p>— Yan Ping</p>
<p>In the Education News section of the Shen Bao on the 13th of this month, I saw an extremely plain and painful report.</p>
<p>According to the report, a certain retired teacher, because he was too old to continue teaching, had received a retirement pension from the Bureau of Education. Because the teacher had difficulty making a living, he submitted a request to the Bureau of Education to forward it to the municipal government, requesting an in-kind allocation. After being forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review, the request was ultimately denied because the allocation of in-kind goods to retired teachers was not in compliance with regulations.</p>
<p>Let us put aside the question of whether retired teachers should receive an allocation and discuss the livelihood problems of retired teachers in detail:</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that teachers' salaries are extremely meager. Even being able to barely maintain the minimum daily life while still employed is a blessing, and there is no possibility of saving. Once they retire in old age, unless their children are able to support them, they are destined to suffer in their old age. I think readers still remember the tragedy of an old teacher committing suicide by jumping into the river, right?</p>
<p>The teacher seems to be too extravagant in requesting an in-kind allocation. Although he was once a "public employee," now that he has retired, he has of course broken away from the words "public employee." As a non-public employee, how could he obtain approval to request a public employee allocation?</p>
<p>Moreover, under the principle that education does not distinguish between public and private, private school teachers, simply because they have the title of "private," are not entitled to enjoy the preferential treatment of "public employees"! Therefore, the reply of "unapproved" to the retired teacher's request for an in-kind allocation is inevitable!</p>
<p>Since the teacher retired because he was "old," he must have served in the education sector for a long time. His students over the years must be all over the world, and perhaps some of them have become wealthy and powerful people. But can they still remember the teacher who cultivated them in their youth?</p>
<p>However, the teacher was fortunate enough to have been a teacher in a municipal school! At least he received a retirement pension from the Bureau of Education upon retirement. Although it is only a few tens of yuan per month, it is still adjusted according to the index. No matter what, it is better than nothing, right?</p>
<p>"Better than the worst, but not as good as the best." I don't know where the approximately 20,000 private school teachers in the city will go to receive even a small retirement pension when they retire in old age in the future?</p>
<h3>Sugar and Crime</h3>
<p>Doctors and psychiatrists at the New Zealand Prison have offered a most original opinion on the reasons for crime and possible treatments. While investigating various crimes, they found that the blood of criminals was deficient in glucose.</p>
<p>"Lack of sugar makes individuals have criminal and violent behavior, movements are crude and fierce, and they are prone to anger," they said. "This phenomenon can be avoided as long as the sugar content in the individual's body is increased."</p>
<p>This may be one of the many reasons why criminal events occur daily in Europe. (Tuó)</p>
<h3>Warmth</h3>
<p>— Binru</p>
<p>Humans have inspiration, so they cannot do without warmth. This is also the natural requirement of animal life, which no one can deny.</p>
<p>Some cold people are often frighteningly cold, making it impossible to approach them, or they can only deal with them superficially. This is the surface that adapts to the social environment, but in fact, these people are not cruel. In the blink of an eye, you will be surprised. Their emotions are often richer than you can imagine. Chinese people like King Xiang of Chu and foreigners like Hitler are typical of this kind.</p>
<p>Without much pulling, I am now thinking about my own affairs. The colleagues or friends, not to mention those who work in the same place, and even more so those who are scattered in various places, always want to chat. Seeing each other every day in the workplace is generally not enough, and naturally, you want to see those who are scattered in other places even more. Therefore, you must find an opportunity to make an appointment to meet in places other than the workplace, such as teahouses, Siyi shops, or a friend's house.</p>
<p>One day, I heard Xiping and Lao Lu make an appointment to drink tea and eat dim sum at Longji tomorrow. The next day, I automatically joined them. Unfortunately, I arrived too late. When I stepped into Longji Teahouse, it was already 4:00 p.m. I saw the waiter already starting to clean up, putting all the stools on the table upside down, leaving only Xiping, a guest, quietly leaning on a chair in the corner of the wall, like all the garbage on the ground, waiting for the waiter to clean up.</p>
<p>I said first:</p>
<p>"Alone?"</p>
<p>"Lao Lu broke his promise."</p>
<p>Xiping handed me a cigarette, so I sat down too.</p>
<p>Regarding breach of promise, we all don't pay much attention to it because sometimes the sun and the moon will also break their promises. There was no sun this day. Xiping's so-called breach of promise was probably because the sun broke its promise, and he had to take Lao Lu's breach of promise seriously. It was gloomy outside the window. Xiping looked at the ceiling and said:</p>
<p>"It looks like it's going to snow!"</p>
<p>The waiter hummed a Cantonese tune while sweeping the floor. Seven or eight tables were already covered with the feet of stools facing the sky. A desolate humor embellished the tragedy of life, and at the same time touched people's sophistication. So I said:</p>
<p>"Closing time!"</p>
<p>The waiter suddenly looked up and smiled at me. He said:</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if you sit for a while."</p>
<p>Not only did it not matter, but he put down the broom and brought boiling water to fill our teapot again.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but smile; the house and the outside were actually the same gray, but at this time I felt that the sky outside was even darker. Sometimes warmth is very hurtful, but humans are born with self-abuse mania.</p>
<p>So we had to leave the teahouse indifferently, and then leave Xiping, until we could no longer hear the waiter's Cantonese tune, until the heads of people busily working at their desks under the lamps replaced the feet of stools on many tables, and then we thought about when to meet with friends somewhere else.</p>
<p>This proves that light cannot replace the sun, and even the gray sky is not as good. Those who emphasize that life is work have a suspicion of turning living humans into dead machines. Suppressing human nature is ultimately impossible, which is why the world is constantly in turmoil. It is not possible to make a big deal out of a small issue. It should be over now. I say: all the abuse that humans can, want, love, and endure, except for warmth, is not worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Free Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Calamities Never Come Singly (45)</p>
<p>Qing smiled and said, "You are only planning for yourself and not thinking about others." Zhu Qi said, "I am purely planning for others. If I were only planning for myself, I would go to a monastery and become a monk, which would be the easiest way!" Qing said, "Okay! Don't talk about becoming a monk. I have heard these words so many times. I only hope that you will not lose your conscience when things are done in the future and disappoint others." Zhu Qi said, "I won't do that unless I lose my initial purpose!" Xiang said, "I only hope she can realize it. It will be easy to handle. If she stubbornly refuses, I can't do anything about it. I will try it for the future happiness of you two." Zhu Qi bowed repeatedly and said, "That's great. You just go there once." Yun Qing said, "This matter cannot be resolved in a few words, nor can it be successful by going to see her once. If it doesn't succeed and something happens, don't blame me!" Zhu Qi said, "If it doesn't succeed, I'm just unlucky. Nothing will happen." Yun Qing said, "Why not? If she thinks what you say is wrong, she will tell your father, isn't that bad? Even if she doesn't tell your father and has a big quarrel with you, you can't bear it." Zhu Qi said, "I'm not afraid of arguing with her; telling my father would be terrible. I'm relying on you to influence her, telling her to understand the pros and cons tomorrow and automatically propose a divorce. That would be the best. With your talent, you can definitely succeed in these little things." As he said this, he bowed repeatedly. Yun Qing just sat still, stopped for a while, and changed his face and said, "I still have to ask you a question. If this matter is successful, what is the first step you will take?" Zhu Qi said, "Can't you guess the second step? I don't think I need to say more." As he spoke, he folded his middle finger and thumb and raised it to Yun Qing's face with a slap. Yun Qing's face turned red and said, "Don't be happy, I think there will be many difficulties in the future!" Zhu Qi said, "Didn't you say that things are done by people, and those who have a will will succeed? I'm going to do it with all my strength. Do you dare to say you don't have this courage?" Yun Qing said, "Don't brag. When your father loses his temper, let's see if you dare to go all out?" Zhu Qi laughed and said, "No, no, I was very sad today, but you made me feel so happy. How about we go out for a small restaurant?" Yun Qing said, "No need, I already told them to prepare dinner when you came." Zhu Qi looked at his watch and said, "After we finish eating, will you go there once for me?" Yun Qing said, "You are so impatient. If I don't go, you will blame me for not being enthusiastic. You need to know that I am not impatient. I feel like I owe a debt when I promise someone something. I don't feel comfortable until I pay it off immediately." As he said this, the two smiled tacitly.

<h3>"Name" and "Reality"</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhengbi</p>
<p>Whenever something is excellent in a foreign country, once it is moved to our China, regardless of whether it is a big or small matter, it invariably changes in quality and deviates from the original. It's not that I agree with the saying that the moon is better abroad, but the fact is that there are very few exceptions, so I dare to make this judgment.</p>
<p>Just to give an example from my own field of expertise. In public schools, so-called public-funded students, of course, have all their tuition, meals, accommodation, and even uniforms and miscellaneous expenses, provided by the government. Moreover, I have seen in the newspapers the magnificent regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education, which also stipulate this. However, what is the reality? I have a child who was admitted to a provincial normal school last year. When he first entered the school, he had to pay for medical care, books, experiments, materials, uniforms, etc., as usual. Moreover, he also had to submit eighty catties of white rice. If he didn't pay it clearly, he couldn't even think about living in the school, let alone attending classes. It is said that the eighty catties of white rice were because the provincial government was in arrears with the public funds, and the school couldn't afford to advance it, so it was temporarily borrowed and would be returned in full at the end of the semester. Since the explanation was quite reasonable, and the cost was generally lower than that of other schools, it was impossible not to pay, so naturally, we had to follow the orders respectfully.</p>
<p>Who knew that this had become a rule? At the beginning of each semester, we were always notified that because the public funds were in arrears, students had to temporarily pay eighty catties of white rice each. Last year, no rice was returned in the first semester. In the second semester, when summer vacation was approaching, the students demanded a refund, causing a stir that became widely known. Only then was permission granted for a refund. However, how much was refunded? It was probably less than seventy or eighty percent of the original amount. What about this semester? I heard that they want to ask the students to donate to the school and will not refund it.</p>
<p>I think that if you want to collect rice for meals, you should clearly and explicitly stipulate how much you want, so that everyone knows it publicly. Those who can afford it will naturally come to study. Now, the students have the name of public-funded students, and after graduation, each person has an obligation to serve for three years, but the rights they enjoy are only partial. Isn't that a case of the name not matching the reality? I don't think the so-called public-funded students abroad are like this.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that this is entirely a matter of "name" and "reality." Ancient Chinese sages took the issue of name and reality very seriously, but since ancient times, the Chinese nation has always suffered from this major problem of name not matching reality. Even when establishing a theory or starting a business, the motivation and reason are always said to be excellent, but in most cases, there is another purpose. What is said in the mouth is often completely different from what is thought in the heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think we still have to emphasize the issue of name and reality. It is best to pursue reality for the sake of name, and it is always good to pursue reality for the sake of name. What is most unacceptable is when the name does not match the reality, or when the name is contrary to the reality. Why do I say that pursuing reality for the sake of name is always good? Think about it: a person who has made a fortune wants to do charity to gain a reputation as a philanthropist. Wouldn't this always be beneficial rather than harmful to the public? As for collecting fees from public-funded students, no matter what new methods are used, I think it will be impossible to come up with an irrefutable reason.</p>
<p>Swimming Island Shi Shi</p>
<p>Swimming Island, also known as River Island, mostly resides behind waterfalls that ordinary birds cannot reach. Their nests are made of fresh moss. Each time they leave or return to their nests, they must cross the waterfall, hence they develop excellent water skills. Their food is small insects in the rapids. When they dive to the bottom of the water to look for food, if they find a target, they immediately spread their wings and "fly" over to catch their prey. Because they do not have webs or fins or other swimming "tools," they cannot swim, but can only vibrate and "fly" in the water, as if in the air.</p>
<h3>The Old Prince's Brush</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>There was a foreign artist who excitedly ran to a certain art gallery, wanting to buy a painting. He pointed to a painting hanging on the wall and asked the artist what the idea was. The artist said it was "Spring Half-Gnawing Grass". The buyer asked where the grass was. The answer was that it had all been half-eaten. He then asked: "Where's the cow?" The artist's answer was very straightforward: since the grass has been chewed, the cow has probably gone away!</p>
<p>This story fully exposes the ugliness of a group of empty-headed art masters abroad. They may hold an exhibition, but they don't know what they are exhibiting, yet they mark it with high prices. If someone really buys one of their paintings, wouldn't they be taking back a picture of half-eaten green grass, with the cow nowhere to be found? There are many examples of this in the empty calligraphy and painting exhibitions in Shanghai. What is hanging on the wall is equivalent to a blank sheet of paper. When appreciating it, it is the exquisite mounting that is worth admiring.</p>
<p>The paintings of Mr. Fu Xishe, the recluse of West Mountain, are not like this "Spring Cow Gnawing Grass Picture". His landscapes and his own school of coloring have transmitted the soul of art to the paper through the brush. Appreciating Mr. Fu's paintings is like seeing the indifferent and contented state of mind of an old prince on the canvas. What is most representative are a few winter scenes. Even when depicting the bright and beautiful scenery of spring, he never uses gaudy painting techniques to please the public. Instead, he makes your imagination naturally run to a quiet valley, which may have weeping willows in the wind and branches full of red flowers, but cannot hide the lofty spirit of lonely self-appreciation. He needs you to walk into the painting yourself, but he never waves his hand to invite your arrival.</p>
<p>I am completely ignorant of Chinese painting, but I have a special preference for the brushstrokes of the old prince. Looking at his paintings from his background, environment, and the events surrounding him in recent years, it seems that all the grievances have been sublimated from the painting and crystallized into a supreme work of art. From his few lines of inscription, you can capture some of his mood.</p>
<p>Of course, I can only take a cursory glance at the exhibitions. A friend of mine, when he was in Peking, wrote to me on letter paper with the name of Mr. Fu's painting. I still treasure it to this day, partly for friendship and partly for the old prince's brush.</p>
<h3>Painter</h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>In the 18th century, most American painters made a living by painting portraits for the wealthy. However, those wealthy people never shed their nouveau riche habits. Not only did they like to make their own decisions, but they were also impatient and unwilling to sit still for a month or twenty days for the painters to paint. So the painters came up with a solution. They painted figures in various poses and wearing various luxurious clothes, leaving only the face blank. Customers only needed to choose a picture, and the painters would quickly paint their faces on it. As a result, everyone was happy, and the painters made a fortune.</p>
<p>But the Russian painters of the Middle Ages were different. Although some of them painted portraits, most of them focused on painting "divine" images. In order to make the "spirit" of the paintings more vivid, they often first drew a beautifully posed skull on the paper or cloth, then added various fleshly organs to the skull, and then added clothes and hats. Therefore, whenever the color of the clothes in the painting peeled off, you could see the flesh or even the white bones underneath. It is said that this is how each painting can have its own personality.</p>
<h3>On Zeng Guofan</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>From a national standpoint, Zeng Guofan should indeed be called a "sinner," but putting that aside, and looking at his life and career alone, he had a very adaptable spirit and methods.</p>
<p>When the Taiping Army rose up, it was the darkest period of Qing dynasty politics. The reason why the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was able to occupy as many as seventeen provinces and last for fifteen years was largely due to the cultivation of corrupt officials. Zeng made efforts to rectify the bureaucracy while militarily contending with the Taiping Army. He was clean and diligent himself, and had the determination, ability, and methods to rectify the bureaucracy, so that the bureaucracy was completely renewed, and the military was able to progress smoothly. Zeng's methods of governing officials were divided into four categories: selecting officials, observing officials, training officials, and caring for officials. Observing officials and training officials were even more important. He strictly examined and assessed incumbent officials, and rewards and punishments were clearly defined, which boosted morale. He formulated four articles of exhortation for prefects and magistrates, and four articles of exhortation for committee members, all of which were good ways to train officials. He exhorted prefects and magistrates to govern the yamen well, clarify the laws, attach importance to agriculture, and advocate frugality. He exhorted committee members to be diligent, frugal, and studious, and to avoid arrogance. These were all to the point of the abuses of ordinary officials at the time.</p>
<p>Zeng not only advocated governing officials and did his best to seek out talent and appoint them regardless of seniority, but also made great efforts to cultivate them, turning the untalented into the talented, and the less talented into the more talented. As a result, talent emerged and became a trend. His method was "to greatly reward talent, sparing no effort" and "to treat each other sincerely and employ them according to their abilities." These sixteen characters can encompass everything.</p>
<p>Zeng's cultivation of talent started with the word "diligence". Throughout his life, Zeng took the lead in diligence with his subordinates, frugality with himself, not fearing difficulties, not taking shortcuts, giving credit to others, and taking labor for himself. He used this spirit to govern the army, which was able to boost morale; he used it to rectify the bureaucracy, which was able to refresh the political situation. How could he not succeed!</p>
<p>On the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom side, there were Li Xiucheng, Chen Yucheng, Shi Dakai, and others. Their wisdom, courage, and talent were not inferior to Zeng. The reason Zeng was able to succeed was precisely because of these methods. He took the military as the center and politics as the auxiliary, and continued to develop by cultivating talent. The force that drove this method was his tenacious and resolute spirit.</p>

<h3>A Quarrel in the Bedroom Between Husband and Wife Resulted in Being Detained and Spanked on the Palm. Sichuan Reader Asks if It Constitutes Police Misconduct.</h3>
<p>Editor Han:</p>
<p>Your publication is the voice of the people, the mirror of society, and the mentor who upholds justice for the people. Although we are still in Sichuan, we have long known this deeply. Now is the era of the democratic torrent and the extension of civil rights. Every corner of China should be filled with light, justice, and reason. However, on the contrary, in a corner of eastern Sichuan—Wushan—I have suffered the extremely dark humiliation of power.</p>
<p>This incident occurred on the morning of November 1st. My wife and I were disciplining our children in the room. Due to a sudden difference of opinion, a quarrel broke out. After the neighbors mediated, the quarrel ended. Because my residence is not far from the police station, the chief of the station, Li Guozhi, was out on the street and learned about it from the people around him. He immediately sent several soldiers to detain my wife and me in the station. Without asking for the reason or details, he said that we were causing trouble for no reason and disrupting social order, and wanted to beat each of our buttocks with forty military sticks. Later, after the police officer Zhu Hanchen repeatedly dissuaded him, he changed the punishment to twenty military sticks on each of our palms. I was extremely angry after suffering this humiliation. I don't know if a quarrel in the bedroom between my wife and me constitutes a crime under the law. Please answer this question in your newspaper. Respectfully, Feng Weizhou</p>
<p>[Answer from the General Administration of Police of the Ministry of the Interior] "An investigation reveals that a quarrel in the bedroom between a husband and wife, which was stopped by others, cannot legally constitute disrupting social order. Furthermore, the police law does not stipulate corporal punishment. The actions of Li Guozhi, the chief of the Wushan County Police Station, if true, are naturally illegal. If the person being punished is dissatisfied with the punishment imposed, he may file a complaint with a higher authority in accordance with Article 46 of the Law on Arrest and Punishment by the Police."</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Article 46 of the Punishment Law stipulates: "Those who are dissatisfied with the decision of the police authority regarding a police matter may file a complaint with its higher authority within five days from the day after receiving the decision." Mr. Feng has suffered this improper punishment, and the statutory time limit for filing a complaint has passed, I am afraid that there is nothing he can do!</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Answered by Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</p>
<p>[Song Kemin from Tianjin Road asks] The transfer telegrams sent to Hankou sometimes have delivery receipts and sometimes do not. I don't know what the reason is? How many hours does it take for express telegrams and special express telegrams sent to Hankou to arrive? (Answer) The time limit for special express telegrams is one hour and thirty minutes. The fact that the special express telegrams sent to Hankou sometimes have them and sometimes do not is because sometimes there are machine line obstacles or the special express telegrams are congested, and they cannot arrive within the specified time limit for a while. In order to avoid delays, it is necessary to restrict receipt according to the situation. As for express telegrams between Shanghai and Hankou, they can arrive on average in about four hours.</p>
<p>[Yuan Xicai from Changchun Road asks] I heard that your newspaper has a method of replacing addresses with telephone numbers to simplify telegram procedures. I don't know what the nature of it is? (Answer) The function of replacing addresses with telephone numbers is the same as replacing addresses with telegram registration numbers. The format for sending a telegram is to first write the "toll payment" character, and then in order (telephone number) (recipient's name) (text of the telegram). After receiving the telegram, the receiving bureau will immediately transmit it to the recipient by telephone. The (original telegram) will be delivered by a special messenger within a few hours after the telephone notification.</p>
