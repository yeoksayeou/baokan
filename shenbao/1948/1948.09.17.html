<p>〔合衆社香港十六日電〕由於中國所頒布之新出境條例，自上海乘飛機或船隻來港之旅客人數已銳减。但傳若干「老虎」仍得規避限制而抵達此間。據稱：「老虎」等或由京飛穗，或在漢口乘粵漢路車赴廣州，然後再自廣州來港，因此母需在滬申請許可證。傳廣州當局亦擬實施此項條例。同時，違犯中國經濟條例之人能否引渡返華，頗有疑問。代理檢察長郎斯丹爾曾向報界列舉廿六項可以引渡之罪行，但運犯經濟條例者未在其列。</p>

<h3 id="c18">勤儉重在力行足以改變風氣　總統登高一呼不一針强心劑 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕蔣總統發起勤儉建國運動，號召全國同胞戒除奢侈，消減腐敗，崇尙節約，積極建設後，記者頃分訪在京立委，大學敎授及社會名流陳裕光·張慶積·鄒樹文·陳顧達等，叩詢意見與看法，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>陳裕光認為：國人之動儉，乃在革命過程中絕對必要之生活方式，過去已三次失去可推行節約之時機，惟謂「亡羊補牢猶未為晚，此次政府有計劃，有步驟，有辦法地推行勸儉運動，換言之即澈底改革豪富生活，必可博得全國人民熱烈擁議」。渠結論謂：「動儉運動重在力行，祗要肯扎扎實實身體力行，每項公約切實做到，戡亂建國無不成之理」。</p>
<p>張慶楨謂：「動儉建國運動，不　給現在腐化麻木的社會打一針强心劑，這次蔣總統發動動儉建國運動，實針對不合理現象而發，一般人民痛苦已不堪聞問，只希望吃飯·穿衣而無能為力，此運動經蔣總統登高一呼，切實提倡，確為大多數人民說話，乃對社會的一針强心劑」。張氏對這運動性質方面的看法是：「此一道德運動，在激發大家良心來節制消費，降低享受，比法律來得澈底深刻。同時，勤儉建國運動是一種風氣的轉移運動，改變風氣，乃最澈底辦法」。</p>
<p>鄒樹文雖長髯拂胸，精神體力仍充沛如少年，衣履質樸，渠謂：「此運動乃頭等大事，大家都有推行責任，渠對穿奢極款之豪當，深惡痛絕，謂在國家物資極度缺乏，一般人民衣食無着時，不能讓少數有錢人浪費，很多人久已注意及此，例如某一集會中，曾有人提到坐小轎車的政府官員大可改坐三輪車，監察院于院長卽曾首表贊同，渠認為至少在無緊急事故時，不應浪費費汽油」。</p>
<p>陳顧遠謂：勤儉是個人習慣，但亦可形成社會風尙，俱有賴於自動鍛鍊。幣制改革後，積極方面應立卽努力促進生笙，纔可保證改革成功。消極方面要靠全國一致動儉節約。這次節約運動，應多着學於節省外匯·汽車·汽油每日消費量驚人，目前京·滬汽車用戶確有很多浪費，渠贊成立委使用三輪車。陳氏數十年如一日，勤儉簡樸，渠懇切盼望這一建國運動能舉國風行，早觀厥成</p>

<h3 id="c19">國營事業股票的出售 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>國營事業之出售，其原則早定於卅六年二月十七日的經濟緊念措施方案，其後迭次所擬的經濟改革方案中，和財政報吿，亦莫不以是爲吸收游資和平衡預算的手段之一。至八月十九日頒佈財政經濟緊急處分令時，特別注重於國家歲出入預算之均衡，與指定國有事業資產充作金圓券發行準備之一部，於是中舫等五個單位之股票，乃於本月十日實行出售。</p>
<p>自公開發售以來，各界申請認購的，據稱尙稱踴躍，其中中紡台糖等股票，尤爲受人歡迎。但以出售總額與已出售的數目比較起來，究竟相差尙遠。這自然是爲時太促的緣故·而據各方面的觀察，仔細分析起來，則下列各種事實，似亦不爲無因。</p>
<p>（一）這些國營事業，其內部辦理情形，和資產狀况，平素不甚公開，外界頗多隔膜。</p>
<p>（二）預備出售的部份，通扯起來，僅僅佔到全部資產的十分之二，以後管理實權，仍將操在官股手中。</p>
<p>（三）中紡招商等股票規定以五股爲最小單位，每股金圓百元，折合法幣達十五億元之鉅，不是一般小戶散戶所能染指的。</p>
<p>（四）目前發行地點，尙祇限於上海一埠，而這一埠之內，經手發行的，又祇限於五家行局，也還不够普徧。</p>
<p>（五）買進股票的，頗多以運甩頭寸爲目的，而不一定是長斯投資的。現在證券市塲尙未開放，深恐脫手不易，妨礙了資金的運用。</p>
<p>以上各點，一般都是如此看法。因此之故，要求是項股票之大量推銷，在技術上確還有待改進。改進之道如何？就事論事，恐怕在證劵市塲上能否上市，這一點關係最爲重要。假如以穩定物價之故，目前證交尙難恢復，則其他各方面，便不能不多方設法，以提高一般投資奢之興趣·</p>
<p>當局預定，中紡發行股票爲金圓二億元，招商局三億元，台糖四千八百萬元，台紙一千二百萬元，津紙四百萬元，總計達金圓五億六千四百萬元。這個數目，據一般估計及當局所宣示，大略相當於全國法幣收兌額與現已發行的金圓之總和。所以减少游資，穩定物價，應以這一條途徑最爲切實·在不違反經濟新措施的大前提之下，我們認爲任何可能的辦法，均應斟酌採取，以達到預期的目的。</p>
<p>自從幣制改革以來，大家憂慮着游資充斥，認爲這是經濟穩定的最大威齊：亦大家承認，惟有導入生產，方是納入正軌，具正有裨於國針民生、而要一舉雨得，同時達到　兩個目的，卽吸收游資與　人人生產，則除儘量勸導，令各各以餘剩資金，購買上項股票以外，確也　沒有相當的有效辦法，因爲這是現成的事業，不必發起籌備，另新爐社，而立時可使市塲游　得到正當的出路。這又是幾　規模宏大的事業，與分頭創，零星招募的新事業，其難易遲速大不相同、所以各個公司，應儘可能速把內部眞相迅速公開，使大家增加其信心，同時對於商股的利益，不妨特別加厚，以增高其興趣。其他如發售地點的擴充，和股票買賣的便利等，均應隨時設法，力求改進。如果能推己及人，處處顧到買戶的利益，我們相信，是項股票的銷售，不難蒸蒸日上，打破已往的紀錄·自八一九後，證券交易所業已停市，塲外交易並經一再查禁，然而報紙所載，股票黑市似乎並未完全消滅·可知如何推銷這個問題，並無多大困難，只項使大家先知道購買此等股票確係利潤優厚，授受便利而已。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕國防部政工局發表九月九日至十五日之一週戰局報吿，全文如下：</p>
<p>（一）新的形勢　自七月初陳劉匪部在中原會戰遭受慘重打擊後，元氣大傷，近來雖積極整補，準備再度會戰，但因新兵過多，實力有限，以致二月未敢蠢動，全國各戰塲，也沒有大戰事，週來匪之整補，似已吿一段落，有在魯中豫西晋中遼西發動反攻情勢。國軍月來已積極實施改革，經在制度，訓練，補給，待遇，各方面加以改進，戰力日益充實，前方士氣旺盛，官兵對勦匪工作及打匪戰術，都有新的認識，近半月來己在皖北鄂北豫東蘇北地區採取主動，對匪發動攻勢，匪軍恐慌萬狀，原在蘇北豫東之匪，未敢抵抗，大部狼狽逃往魯南魯西，戰事重心移往山東，新的形勢卽形成。</p>
<p>（二）魯中會戰在即華東蘇北豫東戰塲，卽將吿一段落，戰事重心已逐漸北移魯中方面，目前　集在濟南外圍的匪軍約五個縱隊，在魯中津浦兩側之匪近九個縱隊，合共約三十萬人，一面圖攻我濟南，打我援軍，一面厚集兵力，圖向隴海綫上反攻，會戰即將開始，將爲華中第二次決戰，戰爭期間或較上次中原會戰爲長，陳匪遭受失敗，必將比上次會戰更慘，因國軍已有充分準備，匪之各種企圖陰謀，都不難予以擊破。</p>
<p>（三）豫西匪圖流竄豫西劉伯承匪軍近已陸續將其兵力集結，合計八個縱隊加一個軍，共二十萬人，大部在平漢路西側襄城方城一帶集結，積極備戰，或於最近分向南北流竄，國軍在各方面均已準備，予以迎頭痛擊。</p>
<p>（四）華北戰塲冀東方面：流竄在平古沿綫的聶匪，自遭我軍痛擊後，其第二縱隊第四旅及第四縱隊主力，乃向三河縣方面竄擾，經國軍兩路夹擊，匪又負創向平谷以東退去。李運昌匪的十一縱隊，會同匪第十三軍分區軍區部隊，在十三日晨分向安山石門昌黎等地流竄擾亂，石門團隊於十三日曾一度撒退，但經援軍開到，在五小時的進勦后即收復該地，連日以來，我陸空配合，正分別向該方面的匪猛烈反擊，刻戰事猶在進行中。</p>
<p>太原方面：週來無大戰事，聶匪一·二縱隊大部向大同方面移動竄擾·又，我空軍不時飛榆次·太谷·祁縣·平遙·介休等匪後地區偵炸，毀匪車輛甚多，並曾命中匪十五縱隊四十五旅旅部</p>
<p>（五）東北戰塲，錦西方面：匪第九縱隊之二十七師，夥同獨六·獨八·等匪部，爲策應北寗路關內段匪軍的竄擾，於十二日由張弼堡渡大凌河，竄抵義縣（錦州西北）西南地區，當晚有一部與我二虎橋國軍發生接觸，自十三日起，即分向興城等地流竄，匪獨四師及十八軍分區部隊亦加入戰鬥，戰事在興城東北韓家溝一帶進行。遼北匪第七第十縱隊均向遼西移動，遼西或有大戰，刻我大軍已分路進勦流竄該方面之匪，不難予以擊退。</p>
<p>長春方面：匪在外園調動頻繁，運輸忙碌，該地區之匪，近來數量日有增加，其目的似仍在繼續圍困我長春，等待氣候的嚴寒，使我在糧食燃料方面感受困難，再施陰謀，惟國軍巳有準備，匪之企圖不易達到。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕此間外交觀察家今日稱：在下午四小時內，蘇外長莫洛托夫與西方三國代表將舉行新會商。問一方面又稱，三國政府業已有新訓令分致其駐蘇代表，惟此方面人士認為在聯大會揭幕前，能否獲致何類協定，尙屬疑問·又稱，祗有在蘇聯準備採取完全不同及更其和解態度下，協定始有可能。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕消息靈通方面聞史達林刻在哥溪之喬其亞別墅休養。倫數接獲消息，史達林已於數日前離克林姆宮，大約將蘭京一月之久。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕西方外交家稱，決定性的四强關於柏林封鎖的談判，將於下週初目莫斯科移向巴黎，而準備攤牌。彼等指出，蘇外長莫洛托夫及英國參加莫斯科會談之寡使羅伯茲，均將出席聯大會。同時美英法三國外長鈞將與會，因此柏林糾粉可能被提出，作最高級的商談。在倫敦外交界方面預測，至少還有一次克林姆宮會議。據稱，史達林現不在莫斯科，但英國方面認為史達林出席與否，實無多大差別，渠在適當時仍能隨時參加會談。外交界方面並稱，西方國家已同意對蘇聯提出一實際上等於哀的美頓的照會，要求立即解除柏林封鎖，否則談判決裂。渠等稱，在最近一次會談中，西方代表對柏林共黨之行動，嘖有怨言，莫洛托夫僅傾耳恭聽，全部會談中幾乎全是西方代表的發言。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕據悉，最後一次克林姆宮會談中，西方代表曾堅持蘇聯應令駐德軍事總督遵守莫斯科所頒之原來訓令。莫洛托夫要求以更多時間加以研究，俾能稍遲答覆。然西方代表堅持要求不應拖延而立即再度會議。外交界相信莫氏有三途可循，渠可答曰「否」，而促使莫斯科會談瓦解，渠亦可答「是一而令索帥遵守原來訓令。渠要可不切實作答，接受一二細則，另提反建議，使談判拖延。外交界相信蘇聯不擬有肯定之答覆而爭取時間。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕消息靈通方面十六日宣稱；據來自遠東方面之秘密消息，共產國際情報局東南亞支部，已在五月間開始工作。據揣測，東南亞支部之總部係設於泰國京城曼谷之蘇聯公使館內，蓋蘇聯在公使館內保持四十人左右，而實際上蘇聯在泰國，並無顯濟之利益存在。</p>
<p>美國官員稱：當蘇聯公使館於五月間在曼谷成立後，東南亞之共黨活動，即大趨活躍。共情局東南亞支部所轄之範圍，一般認為係包括泰國·緬甸·馬來亞·印度支那及東印度羣島。以上各區中，共黨激起之騷動均在夏季接踵而起，在印度尼西亞，竟使聯合國斡旋委員會之和平努力，太受打擊。據此間獲得之情報，共然在亞洲殖民地區採用之策略，與歐洲無異，在每一地區，一切活動均由蘇聯訓練之人員一人或一人以上指揮，此種人員可能在官方佔有地位，亦可能係地下人員。例如在法屬印度支那，越盟共和國領袖胡志明，即在莫斯科留學四年；在印尼，狩黠之土著領袖亞立門，即係蘇聯所訓練者。此間外交家認為：共黨之活動，意在强化蘇聯之命令，俾在遠東和平會議中，獲得發方權。蓋蘇聯外交部長莫洛托夫早已宣稱：基於蘇聯曾參加對日作戰，要求蘇聯應獲得在亞洲最後和平中之主要任務，包括否決權在內，而此種熊度，則堅決為中·英·美·法四强所反對。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕出境物資携運許可辦法公佈後，昨日物價又見蠢動，商人見有利可岡，競購物資，致紗布等又漲達限價。蔣督導員有鑒於此，爲防患不然計，已於昨晨面諭物資調節委員會負責人員，暫緩將該項辦法行文各機關，以延遲其實施期間。同時物資調節委員會因外埠之物價，近己高於上海，倘一且准許物資流通，則本市現有之物資，勢必利用種種方式，大量逃避，故日內將召開會議，對各區間貨物之流通問題，從長計議。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市况，因紗運出口已獲具體辦法，各方人心頓轉興奮，外埠客帮添辦頗勁，本街複製業及實用廠商，紛起吸購，走勢突吿鋒俏。</p>
<p>市上細紗供售不多，各級均登限成交，二十一支雙馬紗廠方有開售，價七百七十五元成交，二十支走銷甚旺，客帮猶多添購，各檔均重叩限盤成交，十六支十支精紗喊價亦稍帶硬。</p>
<p>又悉：紡建公司續開二十支五子，紅魁星天女等紗，共有八種，價爲七百零七元，成交四百三十一件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，困傅出口辦法實施有待，經紀人奉命對於字號申莊交易，祗准代爲賣出，不許替人購進，公會董理事長勸告同業勿抬價格，檯面人心因此平穩，塲內本街所進各貨互有吐售。</p>
<p>龍頭細布初盤卽吿下挫四角，中途一度轉俏，近午收時號家獲利有吐，價遂回至廿八元四角收盤，較上日回跌二角。中檔五福細布劇瀉一元，喇叭童軋小九角，惟B字喇叭童獨好一元。此外四君子嗶嘰及白坯布，亦均帶疲，全市成交一千三百疋。</p>

<p>近來本市出口業務情形，又呈衰狀，與改革幣制之初相比，减少甚多。究其原因，爲各出口物資之產區價格上漲過多，上海物價穩定，如電慶萬縣所產之桐油，每噸合金圓七十四圓，而本市之售價每噸僅七十圓；蚌埠所產三寸五分長之猪鬃，每司馬担價爲二千圓，本市之售價每司馬担價僅爲一千四百圓；平水所產之毛茶，每担售價爲八十圓，此在上海平水之毛茶經加工後之箱茶，售價僅爲一百圓；事實上毛茶加工，製成箱茶，其加工費絕對在二十圓以上，以產區之價格與本市市價相比，再加運費，相差過多，故出口商遷來均不願向產區購貨。目前所出口者，均係以往各該商人所囤存之物資，短時期內卽可售完。現出口商等極盼當局能抑平產區之物價，否則本市之出口物資價格，定將受其影響云。</p>

<p>今日爲農曆中秋節，食米雜糧麵粉棉紗食油荳餅等市塲均循例休假一天，惟銀錢業曁棉布市塲等則仍照常營菜。昨日雖爲節前一日，但銀根依然極爲鬆弛，行莊均感多單，拆放爲難，此項節關銀根奇鬆現象，爲向所罕有，故工商各業應付頭寸，毫不感覺困難，均可安度佳節，不致有何意外發生。昨日四行二局又差出一六二萬元，內計央行進二〇萬元，中國出六八萬元，交通進二三萬元，農民出七二萬元，中信局出大五萬元，郵匯局出二七萬元，合作金庫進二七萬元云。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕敎部修正小學課程標準，現已核定公佈。聞此次修正者，爲求簡化，各科僅列目標及綱要二部份，至實施辦法，修訂經過及各科敎學要點等項，將於另編之「小學課程標準詮釋」內，詳細編訂。</p>
<p>又此次修正者有下列數特點：（一）認定課程標準與課程不同，課程是學校功課的進程，課程標準是課程之標準。換言之，是量度課程之標準，並非課程。故此次修正者，抽象扼要，富有彈性，以便各地均可依照標準，編訂本地適用之課程，各自應用。並具有永久性可以施行多年，無需修改，以免時常變動。（二）各學年每週敎學時間，儘量設法减少，以减輕兒童負担。並將課外集團活動，列入時間總表內，使各學校注意課外活動（三）恢復公民訓練。民國廿一年修正之小學課程標準，除將公民之知識部份，在初級常識高級社會各科中敎學外，增設公民訓練，訂定訓練標準，以便指導兒童力行。卅一年修訂課程標準，將是項訓練標準，分成訓育標準，及衛生訓練標準兩種。現仍合而爲一，幷將兒童不易瞭解之規條，一律删去·（四）規定國語與常識，仍可分編踝本，分科敎學。一二學年常識，不用課本，敎師依據另編之敎學法敎育。（五）規定算術從第三學年開始正式敎學。第一二學年改爲隨機敎學，在「學科和時間」內，不特定敎學時間。（六）恢復美術科，將圖畫科併入美術科內，擴大範國，注意美的陶冶，不能僅注意畫的技術。（七）第一二兩學年的音樂和體育兩科，仍併爲「唱歌遊戲」一科，勞作和美術兩科，仍併爲「勞作」一科，以加强聯合敎學，適應低年級兒童之程度。</p>

<p>中級單打複賽</p>
<p>高級單打複賽</p>
<p>昨日比數，殊出一般觀衆意外，葉觀雄陷於苦戰，王文正老將不老，拼一拼不絕有妙球出現。葉勝第一盤太易，第二盤輕敵一鬆，挽救不及，第三盤葉亦露疲態，王文正乘機進展，爲昨日勝負關鍵。論形勢，半斤八兩。</p>
<p>第一盤中葉觀雄之巧妙削球及準確之對角長抽，使王文正疲於奔命，不知所措，〇比二後，葉運下六局。第二盤未出全力，演出鬆懈，王文正以六比四扳成平手。第三盤爲王文正年來演出最精彩之一盤，兇勁之正手抽擊，使葉觀雄之上網及短球，功効消失，於四座雷鳴之彩聲中，四度平手後，以七比五擊敗力岡掙扎之强敵。第四盤葉觀雄一綫生機所繫，孤注一擲，王文正則因肥碩過人，早已精疲力竭，衣衫盡濕，葉觀雄催枯拉朽，追成和局。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕我國世運足球隊領隊容啓兆博士，昨日下午四時假座康樂酒樓招待本市各報記者，到此次足球隊赴英經過，有極詳盡之報吿。茲摘錄如下：</p>
<p>（一）足球隊此次出國，沿途備受各地僑胞及我國使館熟烈歡迎招待。原定比賽廿五塲，後增加十塲，共卅五塲，綜計勝廿五場，負五塲，和五塲。抵英後，友誼賽勝美國，世運賽敗於土耳其。返國途中，五塲全勝。</p>
<p>（二）足球隊組織簡單而民主化，僅容氏本人任領隊，李惠堂任敎練。復推定執行委員會五人主任全隊事宜，爲容李及馮景祥，黎兆榮，張邦綸。又推嚴士鑫葉淸榮任會計司帳，全部公開。</p>
<p>（三）足球隊出發時不名一文，全國體協無分文津貼。由容氏在港借得港幣六萬元，港足球總會捐贈一萬六千元，在港賽球，收入一萬四千元，合計九萬港幣，付去飛機票後，僅餘數千元。沿途賽球共收入廿六萬七千元，在加爾各答替代表團付食宿費，替籃球隊付旅費，回來帶田徑代表回來，以致離英時，飛機票款，在通濟隆欠帳回來。收支兩抵，在港借款尙有二萬餘元，無法歸還。足球隊本身未欠債，乃是代表團負的債。回國時擬赴菲籌款還債，因馬尼拉雨季，球隊不能成行。可說，足球隊已爲全體代表團盡力盡忠。</p>
<p>（四）郝更生在南洋捐款，僅四百餘鎊歸帳，代表團在倫敦，一天要用一百二十幾鎊。隊員零用錢無着，旅費吿罄，總敎練夫婦還住在高貴旅館裏。代表團抵加爾各答時，經費僅餘卅幾鎊，窘態可見。</p>
<p>（五）參加世運足球觀感：歐洲足球進步神速，體力長力驚人，踢上一二小時，速度不减，亳不在乎。我國之敗，長力不濟，體力不如。不慣踢雨球，雨中越踢越重，越重越踢不動。歐洲各國皆騁英國職業敎練，成績可觀。足球隊可吿慰者，爲全隊和諧合作，精神極佳。</p>

<h3 id="c122">說女寵 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>從來有句俗話：「英雄難過美人關。」雅言之：「英雄氣短，兒女情長。」這個由於人類原始本能－所謂「飲食男女，人之大欲存焉。」－發展出來的缺點，眞是沒法管制的，也許正因此，才是可以原諒的。</p>
<p>「後宮佳麗三千人」，固然不人道，野蠻；可是却不妨碍「君王政事」。所怕是「三千寵愛在一身」，那就準定糟糕。古代的歷史，雖不盡可靠，上古史實，更免不了由於後人照貓畫虎的追造，卽如夏桀商紂的亡國，其情形幾乎完全相同，桀有妹喜，而紂有妲己，都是狐媚子。造故事的人固然不高明，幼稚，可是正可以說明男人最喜歡的固是女人，最怕的也是女人。聖經裏面夏娃吞了撒旦的蘋果，罪惡亦是由女人而起。</p>
<p>這些講法，當然全是男性中心社會的一「妄說」，該當爲革命的女同志所抗議。可是，事實上男人雖則統治了天下，其目的無非爲了取悅於女人或多獵取女人，乃至獵取追求不得的女人。「璇宮艷后」克麗派屈拉Cheopatra把凱撒大帝弄得神魂顚倒，以蓋世英雄，終敵不過回眸一笑，豈不異哉！那麼，女子雖在過去沒有全像武則天一般，占盡人間功名富貴，可是有實無名，探驪得珠，也就不必過於懊喪。</p>
<p>誠然，女子是變作了男子的玩物，但那是庸俗的女子，等於庸俗的男人命定的要被役於上智之士一樣。孟子所云，天下無道，小役大，弱役强，其實還不够，原來無論天下之有道無道，永遠是愚者役於智者，這是沒法否認的。中山先生在民權主義裏也承認這個原理。人類全是如此，女子也不例外，不過女子之被役在家中，男人之被役在社會爲不同耳。然在總明的女子，全可以把丈夫玩弄於掌股之上，而使男人不知不覺，這種神通，是了木起的。聊齋志異上的馬介甫與恒娘乃是兩個定型，馬介甫的令正雖凶，却不是恒娘的對手，像恒娘那樣，才够得上以柔克剛，把男人收拾得伏伏貼貼。</p>
<p>因此，家庭乃至國家都像一個戰塲，男人女人表面上是相親相愛，骨子裏則在作戰。不特此也，女子與女子作「內戰」，男子與男子作「內戰」。西人所云，「戰塲上尙有生趣，情塲上動起殺機」，頗是解人。試看自漢唐以來的宮聞之秘，和橫的方面各處桃色案件之多，眞是可以怕人的事。正式的戰爭，可以避免，唯有這種戰爭是不能避免的，無論怎樣改革，總難求合理。美國Dorothy　Parker夫人詩云：「女人要一夫一妻，男偏喜新奇。愛情是女人的日月，男人有別樣的花色。女人跟他丈夫過一生，男人數上十下就頭疼。總起來說旣這般如此，天下還會有什麼好事！」（應分行寫）這不過是女人的話，痴心女子負心漢，一言而已；如在男人方面，何嘗不可反其道而行之？世上負心女子又何嘗少呢？</p>
<p>這一來不要緊，說不定就出了亂子。幽王和褒姒在作神經戰，偏偏來個烽火戲諸侯，把文武之業，一且而墜。好個「一顧傾人城，再顧傾人國」。難得渾賬男人抱了「佳人難再得」之心，城和國可就眞的靠不住了。所以有人大呌，「妾婦之言，不可聽也」。大約是吃過苦頭的。不要說是報事，好事也有弄糟的，蓋男人常覺得枕邊之人最可信，一面聽Curtain　Lerture一面也吹自己的秘密，西太后要罷免貪汚的慶親王，吿訴了軍機瞿子玖，瞿大人却吿訴了他的賢夫人，夫人招待外賓時，又洩於英公使太太，就在Curtain中訓示了公使，於是倫敦晤士報大登而特登，弄得太后老佛爺要澈查這位洩漏機密的隱名氏，結果是瞿大中丞革了職，一切計畫都成泡影。徒使後人慨嘆。請想，改革的大計，怎麼可以吿知女子，何况是要想交在易所裏擺風頭的女子？吾於陶秘書，蓋有不勝遺憾者突，作女寵篇。</p>

<h3 id="c124">薪敬 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>學校已經開學，像我們這批揩黑板和吸粉筆灰的仁兄們又要重打鑼鼓再開塲了。接得騁書，首先要看的是每週任課若干時。接着，便要把我們所當做安家活命的薪金數目瞧個明白，方能定心。</p>
<p>敎員用勞心所換得的代價稱做薪金。這名稱雖然沿用已慣，但右被一輩前輩先生茶餘酒後談起來，則多少是要搖頭的。私熟盛行時代，學生所孝敬塾師的稱做「學錢」，這和現在稱做學費的意義上無大出入。公館人家請西席則不然了；學錢非稱「館榖」，卽稱「束脩」。前者說穿了，無非學費論米計算；但「榖」上安「館」，顯見得這名稱很大方，很淸高，很崇敬，致送者與受領者都覺得問心無愧。後者是根據孔老夫子所說「自行束脩，未嘗無誨」之語而來。束脩據古人注解謂「十脡脯」。伸曰脡，屈曰朐。那末十脡脯用今語來說，大約同「十腳火腿」差不多。請老夫子吃十腳火腿，是最恭敬不過的，無怪孔老夫子肯「循循善誘」了。有了洋錢，束脩有改稱「修羊」的。避用「洋」字，煞費苦心，因老夫子是不能用洋錢來買倒的！也有改稱「修金」的，則已有些銅臭氣味了。「薪金」則從未聽見過。</p>
<p>民初，學校裏送給敎員的稱「修金」；如兼職，則兼職所得的稱做「薪金」。騁書上截然劃開，不相混淆，浙江便是如此。有位朋友曾經爲了聘書上修金誤寫薪金，大發脾氣；現在想來，他太固執了；因不呌你買火腿，那末買些「柴薪」，也是家裏用得着的呀！</p>
<p>自從公敎人員這名稱成立以來，「敎」字遂屈居「公」字下。公務人員，每月服務所得的代價，自然稱做「薪金」，因他們須廉潔自矢，故名義上似乎不能日吃火腿！這樣一來，而敎員名義上可吃些火腿，補補營養的「脩金」，遂也運帶地改稱一薪金」了。孔老夫子，聖之時者」，我想他生在今日，恐也贊成，而要說「束脩，禮也；今也改「薪」，吾從衆」罷？</p>
<p>有人說敎員係騁任，薪金要有別於委任職的公務人員，可仿亡淸疆吏年終餽送窮翰林的「炭敬」例，改稱「薪敬一。我想這未免太咬文嚼字了。質諸「同行」，以爲如何？</p>
<h3 id="c125">香妃墓 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>讀十二日本報，載南疆喀什東郊香妃墓，圓頂墓單，突於八月二日頹圮，並謂此墓爲南疆著名古跡，從此頓失壯觀云云。查香妃故事，知者巳多，而其瘗玉處，則足跡未至新疆者，恐未盡悉，謹述大概，以餉閱者。</p>
<p>按新疆喀什噶爾郊外，約四五里，有香娘娘廟，形方，頂圓，中空而寬大，瓦作綠藍色，狀甚巍煥，廟無偶像，僅有香娘娘墓，此卽以美艷與節烈著稱於有淸中葉（乾隆時）之香妃瘞玉處也。妃爲維吾爾世家，阿吉木沙羣賀加之女，圖公公之妹，生於哈密，五歲，隨父移居吐發蕃，九歲，又移居喀什噶爾，二十歲，嫁大和卓木，身有異香，容華絕代，艷名遐播，竟爲淸帝乾隆所聞，勞師遠征，平南疆，殺大和卓木，虜妃歸，時年二十有二。妃貞烈性成，匪特不屈，且暗藏利器，欲視仇人而甘心，淸帝雖多方煽誘，並在北平爲建回營，陳設一如喀什噶爾，冀博其歡，歷十年，卒不可奪，生爲清太后所聞，恐其害帝，乃以毒酒殺妃，或云縊死，卒年三十八歲。其史嫂亦隨妃被俘在平，妃死後，兄以憂憤亡，嫂乃載妃及兄遺骸，以駝車歷數大沙漠，運回喀什噶爾，立墓建廟，萬里貞骨，歸正首邱，即上述之香娘娘廟也。維吾爾人，感妃之節烈，羣往祭拜，絡繹不絕，歷久廟前漸成八雜，（維吾爾語，市集也。）甚至求子求婚之婦女，以及伉儷不和者，均往祈禱，巳視同神祗矣。憶廿餘年前，乾隆之陵寢，已被發掘，掘後復被　水淹沒，男女骸骨，混雜莫辨，（因其後妃多我，同葬一陵之故。）收其骨者，不得已，乃延以前以辦騐屍爲職務之老作作，配騐收之，草草殮埋。假使香妃當時失節，豈不與諸后妃同葬，而同樣爲盜所掘，骨暴水淹，安得有今日之墓廟，爲南疆生色，而維吾爾人，且香花祝禱而神明視之耶？綏遠歸化城南卅里，有明妃靑塚，（即漢王昭君基。）艷傳千古，此香妃之墓，堪與媲美，然香妃得歸骨故鄉，而明妃則永埋異域，是又香妃之幸也。</p>

The offensive against Jinan by Chen Yi's bandit forces, which had been brewing for over two months, was officially launched at 11 p.m. on the 15th. The Chen bandit forces mobilized eight columns, along with local communist forces, totaling 180,000 men. The 9th, 13th, and Bohai columns, along with the Qinghui and Qinghe independent regiments, attacked Guodian in the east of Jinan and Longdong in the southeast, the two camps of Dongxiwu and Shangxiagang, and the Tangwu Daokou and Dongjiazhuang (about 10 to 20 kilometers from Jinan) areas north of Guodian. The 10th, New 8th, and Cui Ziming's New 11th columns, the New 2nd and 7th regiments, the Taichang Detachment, etc., attacked Changqing in the west of Jinan, Qingyangshu south of Guide, and the local communist Hui militia groups 11th, 12th, and New 2nd regiments, etc., attacked Queshan and Qihe on the north bank of the Shi River. The 3rd, 6th, and Rapid columns were stationed in the Tai'an-Yanzhou area in the central section of the Jinpu Railway as the general reserve force for all parties. However, because Commander Wang Yaowu personally returned to Jinan from Nanjing by special plane at 9 p.m. on the 15th after the alarm and took command, actively responding to the battle, the communist bandit offensive had been thwarted by the evening of the 16th. The morale of the National Army was high, and they clearly held an absolute advantage. In addition, the Jinan Military Police Inspection Office, in order to strengthen the city's defenses, not only moved the curfew time forward by one hour from today, changing it to 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning, but also installed landmines around the protective structures of the city defense works, warning citizens not to approach.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The prelude to the great battle on the outskirts of Jinan officially opened on the evening of the 15th. In addition to the Chen bandit's 9th, 13th, New 8th, 11th (i.e., Cui Ziming's force), and Bohai columns, which were originally based on the outskirts of Jinan, parts of the bandit's 10th, 3rd, and 6th columns, which were previously based in the Dongping and Jining areas, and local communist forces had also rushed to participate in the battle. The military estimates their total strength to be about 180,000 men. The battle was most fierce from 11 p.m. on the 15th until dawn. The thunderous artillery fire shook the surrounding areas. At 7 a.m., the air force of the National Army was dispatched, and the battle eased slightly. As of the evening of the 16th, the National Army still guarded Guodian and Longdong in the east, Zhangxia and Zhonggong in the south, Queshan and Qihe in the north, and the Changqing positions in the west, with no changes from before.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The bandit's 1st, 4th, and Liangguang columns, which were originally based near Chengwu in southwestern Shandong, had fled to Jining. The Rapid Column, which was originally based in Yuncheng, had fled to Yanzhou. The 7th Column was based in Tengxian. This move by the bandits seemed to be an attempt to block the powerful corps of the National Army from advancing north from Lincheng at any time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] Chen Bandit forces in northern Jiangsu were badly defeated by the National Army. Their 2nd Column had fled across the Yi River to the Feixian area in southern Shandong, and their 12th Column had also fled to the area north of Tancheng.

<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 16th] Due to the new exit regulations promulgated by China, the number of travelers coming to Hong Kong by plane or ship from Shanghai has sharply declined. However, it is reported that some "tigers" are still able to circumvent the restrictions and arrive here. It is said that "tigers" and others either fly from Nanjing to Guangzhou, or take the Yuehan Railway train from Hankou to Guangzhou, and then come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou, so they do not need to apply for permits in Shanghai. It is reported that the Guangzhou authorities also plan to implement these regulations. At the same time, it is doubtful whether people who violate China's economic regulations can be extradited back to China. Acting Attorney General Langsdan listed 26 crimes that could be extradited to the press, but those who violate economic regulations were not among them.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 16th] A reporter recently traveled to Tianshan Lake, a famous scenic spot in Xinjiang Province, for a four-day trip. I feel that there are several things that can be reported to the people of the country: (1) Tianshan Lake is located under Bogda Peak, surrounded by cliffs and ancient pine forests. Unfortunately, due to the mischief of nomadic people, fires break out everywhere in the pine forests, with a tendency to spread. Now, the iron-tiled temple around the famous Tianshan Lake is surrounded by flames, burning wildly in the wind. It is feared that the iron-tiled temple buildings will also be affected this winter. (2) The current water storage capacity of Tianshan Lake is more than 15 million cubic meters. If the lake water can be discharged with mechanized equipment, it can irrigate millions of acres of farmland in northern Xinjiang. (3) There are abundant coal and iron ore deposits in the mountains. The reporter met several geological survey personnel in Tianshan Lake who were working in the mountains. According to them, they had gained a lot. However, Tianshan Lake is not only a scenic area, but also can become an industrial area in the future if hydropower can be used. However, it depends on the efforts of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Diligence and Frugality Emphasize Vigorous Implementation to Change the Atmosphere: The President's Call Is Like a Strong Cardiac Injection <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] After President Chiang launched the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality, calling on the people of the country to abandon luxury, reduce corruption, advocate economy, and actively build, reporters recently interviewed legislators, university professors, and social celebrities in Nanjing, such as Chen Yuguang, Zhang Qingzhen, Zou Shuwen, and Chen Guyuan, to ask for their opinions and views. The records are as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Yuguang believes that the diligence and frugality of the Chinese people is an absolutely necessary way of life in the revolutionary process. The opportunity to promote frugality has been lost three times in the past, but he said, "It is never too late to mend the fold. This time, the government is promoting the frugality movement in a planned, step-by-step, and methodical manner. In other words, it is a thorough reform of the extravagant life of the wealthy, and it will surely win the enthusiastic support of the people of the country." He concluded, "The diligence and frugality movement emphasizes vigorous implementation. As long as we are willing to work hard and earnestly implement every covenant, there is no reason why we cannot suppress the rebellion and build the country."</p>
<p>Zhang Qingzhen said, "The National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality is not only giving a strong cardiac injection to the current corrupt and numb society. This time, President Chiang launched the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality, which is aimed at irrational phenomena. The suffering of the general people has become unbearable to hear. They only hope to have food and clothing, but they are unable to do so. This movement has been launched by President Chiang, and is earnestly advocated. It is indeed speaking for the majority of the people, and is a strong cardiac injection to society." Zhang's view on the nature of this movement is: "This is a moral movement. Inspiring everyone's conscience to control consumption and reduce enjoyment is more thorough and profound than the law. At the same time, the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Frugality is a movement to shift the atmosphere. Changing the atmosphere is the most thorough way."</p>
<p>Although Zou Shuwen's long beard brushes his chest, his spirit and physical strength are still as vigorous as a young man. His clothes are simple and unadorned. He said, "This movement is a top priority, and everyone has the responsibility to promote it. He deeply hates the extravagant and luxurious behavior of the wealthy. He said that at a time when the country's materials are extremely scarce and the general people have no food or clothing, we cannot allow a few wealthy people to waste. Many people have long paid attention to this. For example, at a meeting, someone mentioned that government officials who take cars could change to rickshaws. Director Yu of the Supervisory Yuan immediately expressed his approval. He believes that at least in the absence of an emergency, gasoline should not be wasted."</p>
<p>Chen Guyuan said: Diligence and frugality are personal habits, but they can also form social customs, and depend on automatic self-cultivation. After the currency reform, we should immediately work hard to promote production in a positive way, in order to guarantee the success of the reform. In a passive way, we must rely on the whole country to diligently and frugally economize. This time, the economization movement should focus more on saving foreign exchange, automobiles, and gasoline. The daily consumption is astonishing. At present, there is indeed a lot of waste among car users in Nanjing and Shanghai. He supports the use of rickshaws by legislators. Chen has been diligent, frugal, and simple for decades. He earnestly hopes that this national construction movement can become popular throughout the country and see its success as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Sale of Stocks of State-Owned Enterprises <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The principle of selling state-owned enterprises was established as early as the Economic Emergency Measures Plan of February 17, Year 36 [1947]. Subsequent economic reform plans and financial reports have consistently regarded it as a means to absorb idle capital and balance the budget. With the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Measures on August 19, particular emphasis was placed on balancing the national budget and designating state-owned enterprise assets as part of the gold yuan currency issuance reserve. Consequently, the stocks of five entities, including China Textile Industries Corporation, were put on sale on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Since the public offering began, applications for subscription from various sectors have reportedly been quite enthusiastic, with China Textile Industries Corporation and Taiwan Sugar Corporation stocks being particularly popular. However, comparing the total amount to be sold with the amount already sold reveals a significant difference. This is naturally due to the short timeframe. According to observations and careful analysis from various perspectives, the following factors also appear to play a role:</p>
<p>(1) The internal operations and asset conditions of these state-owned enterprises are not very transparent, and the outside world lacks understanding.</p>
<p>(2) The portion designated for sale only accounts for about two-tenths of the total assets. The actual power of management will still be held by government shares.</p>
<p>(3) Regulations require China Textile Industries Corporation, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and other stocks to be in minimum units of five shares. Each share costs 100 gold yuan, equivalent to a substantial 1.5 billion legal tender, putting them beyond the reach of small individual investors.</p>
<p>(4) Currently, the issuance location is limited to Shanghai, and within Shanghai, only five banks and bureaus are handling the issuance, which is not widespread enough.</p>
<p>(5) Many are buying stocks for short-term capital management rather than long-term investment. With the stock market not yet open, there is fear that it will be difficult to sell, hindering the utilization of funds.</p>
<p>These are the general views. Therefore, a large-scale promotion of these stocks still requires technical improvements. How to improve? In practical terms, whether or not the stock can be listed on the stock market is most important. If the stock exchange cannot be restored due to the need to stabilize prices, other aspects must find ways to increase the interest of general investors.</p>
<p>The authorities plan to issue 200 million gold yuan in China Textile Industries Corporation shares, 300 million gold yuan in China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares, 48 million gold yuan in Taiwan Sugar Corporation shares, 12 million gold yuan in Taiwan Paper Corporation shares, and 4 million gold yuan in Tianjin Paper Corporation shares, totaling 564 million gold yuan. According to general estimates and official declarations, this amount roughly corresponds to the total amount of legal tender collected and the gold yuan currency already issued nationwide. Therefore, reducing idle capital and stabilizing prices should be most effectively achieved through this approach. Without violating the basic premise of the new economic measures, we believe any possible measures should be considered and adopted to achieve the intended goals.</p>
<p>Since the currency reform, everyone has been worried about the abundance of idle capital, considering it the greatest threat to economic stability. Everyone also agrees that only channeling it into production can put the economy on the right track, truly benefiting the nation and the people. To achieve both goals simultaneously – absorbing idle capital and engaging everyone in production – there is no other effective method except encouraging people to use their surplus funds to buy these stocks. This is an existing enterprise, eliminating the need for initiation and preparation to establish a new business; it can immediately provide a legitimate outlet for idle funds in the market. Moreover, it is a large-scale enterprise, vastly different in difficulty and speed from starting new, small-scale businesses and recruiting investors piecemeal. Therefore, each company should promptly and openly disclose its internal realities to increase public confidence. At the same time, the benefits for commercial shareholders should be particularly increased to enhance interest. Other aspects, such as expanding sales locations and facilitating stock trading, should also be continuously sought and improved. If one can be considerate and cater to the interests of buyers, we believe the sales of these stocks will undoubtedly flourish and break previous records. Since August 19, the stock exchange has been closed, and off-exchange trading has been repeatedly banned. However, according to newspaper reports, the black market for stocks does not seem to have been completely eliminated. It shows that there is not much difficulty in promoting these stocks; it is only necessary to make everyone aware that buying these stocks is indeed profitable and easy to trade.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Measures for Overseas Personnel to Conserve Foreign Exchange; Reduction of Non-Administrative Consulates from November <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] News from the Information Bureau: The measures proposed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the conservation of foreign exchange by overseas personnel were discussed and approved at the 16th Executive Yuan Meeting on the 15th. The original measures are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Regarding Foreign Exchange for Participating in International Conferences: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall draft effective measures within two weeks to strengthen restrictions on participation in international conferences. (2) All ministries, departments, and bureaus shall be notified that if participation in an international conference is necessary, it should be jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (3) For personnel stationed locally to attend, the allocated public funds should be strictly limited. 2. Regarding Foreign Exchange for Overseas Personnel: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should, to the greatest extent possible, abolish or reduce non-administrative and non-intelligence overseas consulates, reducing them by 10% from November 1st. (2) The foreign exchange budget for the latter half of the year required by military attachés and personnel stationed abroad by the Ministry of National Defense should be reduced by 10% from November 1st. (3) All government agencies, except the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, should submit to the Executive Yuan before October 1st the titles, names, overseas missions, original overseas duration, monthly salaries, public funds, and dates of departure of their personnel temporarily stationed abroad. The Executive Yuan will strictly review whether their continued stay abroad is necessary. Those who the Executive Yuan determines must return to the country must return within two months. Failure to return by the deadline will result in the Central Bank suspending foreign exchange settlements, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should revoke their passports within one month.</p>
<p>3. Foreign Exchange for Publicly and Privately Funded Students Studying Abroad: Dispatch of translators and youth military students abroad is temporarily suspended for one year. Those publicly funded students with a legally fixed amount of self-provided foreign exchange, and who have been strictly reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education, may go abroad. Those without self-provided foreign exchange will not be settled for the time being, but those who have already gone abroad will be handled in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Yuan meeting on September 1st.</p>

<p>Consul Rabbitts Transferred to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] The British consulate established in Macau in 1937 at the start of the Sino-Japanese War was closed today.

<h3 id="e22">Trial of Tao Qiming Case Opens Yesterday; Yuan Yang'an Granted Bail <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] After the complete record of the investigation of the currency reform leak case was transferred to the Capital District Prosecutor's Office, Prosecutor Tian Jihou reviewed it overnight and opened the trial at 8:00 AM on the 16th, concluding at 4:00 PM. As a result, Yuan Yang'an was granted bail of 10,000 gold yuan, as his involvement was deemed less severe. Prosecutor Tian first questioned Tao Qiming, who still wore sunglasses, a gray suit, and white leather shoes, appearing quite haggard. Xu Baiqi's hair was disheveled, and his suit and tie were untied, appearing distressed. Both men carefully considered their answers to the prosecutor's questions. However, due to strict security, the details of the interrogation are unknown. It is reported that the two men argued about leaking information and profiting from it. Yuan Yang'an was granted bail due to his lighter involvement. According to the prosecutor originally assigned to the case by the Special Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office, before the police department transferred the entire file to the Special Criminal Court, he had informally questioned them based on the reports in the newspapers. Xu and Tao had frankly admitted to their actions and had not objected to the police's use of scientific instruments during the interrogation. The police statements had been signed and approved by the defendants, so it was unlikely that they would retract their original confessions. Therefore, the progress of the case seemed quite clear. The transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office was necessary due to legal procedures, and the Special Criminal Court handling the case would be illegal.</p>
<p>[Our Report] After Yuan Yang'an was released on bail, his family in Shanghai stated that Yuan still had private matters to attend to in Nanjing and would return to Shanghai in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e34">New Development in the War Situation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a report on the war situation for the week of September 9-15. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) New Situation: Since the Chen-Liu bandit forces suffered a heavy blow in the Central Plains Battle in early July, their vitality has been greatly damaged. Although they have been actively reorganizing and preparing for another battle, their strength is limited due to the excessive number of new recruits, so they did not dare to act recklessly in February. There have been no major battles in the country. Over the past week, the bandit's reorganization seems to have come to an end, and there is a situation of launching counter-offensives in central Shandong, western Henan, central Shanxi, and western Liaoning. Over the past month, the National Army has been actively implementing reforms, improving the system, training, supplies, and treatment. The combat effectiveness is increasing day by day, and the morale of the front-line troops is strong. Officers and soldiers have a new understanding of the work of suppressing bandits and the tactics of fighting bandits. In the past half month, they have taken the initiative in northern Anhui, northern Hubei, eastern Henan, and northern Jiangsu to launch offensives against the bandits. The bandit army is panicked. The bandits originally in northern Jiangsu and eastern Henan did not dare to resist and fled to southern and western Shandong in a panic. The center of the war shifted to Shandong, and a new situation was formed.</p>
<p>(2) Battle of Central Shandong Imminent: The battles in eastern China, northern Jiangsu, and eastern Henan are coming to an end. The focus of the war has gradually shifted north to central Shandong. Currently, there are about five columns of bandit troops gathered around Jinan, and nearly nine columns of bandits on both sides of the Jinpu Railway in central Shandong, totaling about 300,000 people. On the one hand, they are trying to attack Jinan and strike our reinforcements. On the other hand, they are gathering troops to launch a counter-offensive on the Longhai Line. The battle is about to begin and will be the second decisive battle in central China. The war may be longer than the previous Central Plains Battle. Chen's bandit forces will suffer a more miserable defeat than the previous battle, because the National Army is fully prepared, and it is not difficult to defeat the bandit's various attempts and conspiracies.</p>
<p>(3) Bandits in Western Henan Attempt to Flee: The Liu Bocheng bandit army in western Henan has recently gathered its forces one after another, totaling eight columns plus one army, with a total of 200,000 people. Most of them are gathered in the area of Xiangcheng and Fangcheng on the west side of the Pinghan Road, actively preparing for war, or may soon flee north and south. The National Army is prepared in all aspects to give them a head-on blow.</p>
<p>(4) North China Battlefield, Eastern Hebei: The Nie bandit forces that fled along the Pinggu line, after being severely attacked by our army, their 4th Brigade of the 2nd Column and the main force of the 4th Column fled to the area of Sanhe County. After being attacked by our army from two directions, the bandits were wounded again and retreated east of Pinggu. The 11th Column of the Li Yunchang bandits, together with the troops of the 13th Military Sub-District of the bandit, fled to Anshan, Shimen, Changli, and other places on the morning of the 13th to cause disturbances. The Shimen local defense team withdrew once on the 13th, but after reinforcements arrived, the area was recovered after five hours of suppression. In recent days, our land and air forces have been cooperating and launching fierce counterattacks against the bandits in that area. The battle is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Taiyuan: There have been no major battles this week. Most of the Nie bandit's 1st and 2nd Columns moved to the Datong area. Also, our air force occasionally flew to the bandit-held areas of Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, Pingyao, Jiexiu, and other bandit rear areas for reconnaissance and bombing, destroying many bandit vehicles, and hitting the headquarters of the 45th Brigade of the 15th Column of the bandit.</p>
<p>(5) Northeast Battlefield, Jinxi: The 27th Division of the 9th Column of the bandit, together with the bandit units of the 6th Independent and 8th Independent, in order to coordinate the disturbances of the bandit army in the Guannei section of the Beining Road, crossed the Daling River from Zhangbibao on the 12th and fled to the southwest area of Yixian (northwest of Jinzhou). That night, a part of it came into contact with our national army in Erhupao. Since the 13th, they have been fleeing to Xingcheng and other places. The bandit's 4th Independent Division and the 18th Military Sub-District troops also joined the battle. The battle is taking place in the area of Hanjiagou, northeast of Xingcheng. The 7th and 10th Columns of the bandits in Liaobei are all moving to western Liaoning. There may be a major battle in western Liaoning. At the moment, our army has advanced in several routes to suppress the bandits fleeing in that area, and it will not be difficult to repel them.</p>
<p>Changchun: The bandits are frequently mobilizing and transporting goods outside the city. The number of bandits in the area has been increasing recently. Their purpose seems to be to continue to besiege Changchun, waiting for the severe cold weather to cause difficulties for us in food and fuel, and then carry out conspiracies. However, the National Army is prepared, and it is not easy for the bandits to achieve their goals.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The West Demands Resolution of the Berlin Problem; Soviet Union Adopts Delaying Tactics; Three Ambassadors' Meeting with Stalin Unsuccessful <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Diplomatic observers here said today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will hold new consultations with representatives of the three Western countries in the afternoon for four hours. On the one hand, it is also said that the governments of the three countries have issued new instructions to their representatives in the Soviet Union. However, these people believe that it is doubtful whether any kind of agreement can be reached before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. It is also said that an agreement is only possible if the Soviet Union is prepared to adopt a completely different and more conciliatory attitude.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] According to well-informed sources, Stalin is currently recuperating at his Georgia villa in Goxi. It is said that Stalin left the Kremlin a few days ago and will be away for about a month.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Western diplomats say that the decisive four-power talks on the Berlin blockade will move from Moscow to Paris in early next week to prepare for a showdown. They pointed out that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the British ambassador Roberts, who participated in the Moscow talks, will both attend the UN General Assembly. At the same time, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will also attend the meeting, so the Berlin dispute may be raised for the highest-level discussions. In London diplomatic circles, it is predicted that there will be at least one more meeting in the Kremlin. It is said that Stalin is not currently in Moscow, but the British side believes that it makes little difference whether Stalin attends or not. He can still participate in the talks at any time when appropriate. Diplomatic circles also said that Western countries have agreed to present the Soviet Union with a note that is virtually equivalent to an ultimatum, demanding the immediate lifting of the Berlin blockade, otherwise the negotiations will collapse. They said that in the most recent meeting, Western representatives complained about the actions of the Berlin Communists. Molotov only listened attentively. Almost all the speeches in the entire meeting were made by Western representatives.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] It is understood that in the last Kremlin meeting, Western representatives insisted that the Soviet Union should order the Soviet military governor in Germany to abide by the original instructions issued by Moscow. Molotov asked for more time to study and be able to respond later. However, Western representatives insisted that there should be no delay and that the meeting should be held again immediately. Diplomatic circles believe that Molotov has three paths to follow. He can answer "No" and cause the Moscow talks to collapse. He can also answer "Yes" and order Marshal Sokolovsky to abide by the original instructions. He can also give an insincere answer, accept one or two details, and propose counter-suggestions to delay the negotiations. Diplomatic circles believe that the Soviet Union does not intend to give a definite answer and is buying time.</p>
<h3 id="e36">India-Hyderabad Dispute Added to Security Council Agenda; China's Request for Postponement Denied <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] London, 16th (via radio from Paris): The Security Council convened an emergency meeting on the 16th to discuss Hyderabad's accusation of Indian aggression. The meeting began at 3:00 PM, chaired by Malik. After the opening formalities, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu, citing a lack of instructions from his government, requested a four-day postponement of the discussion, but this was denied. The Soviet representative then requested that the Security Council first discuss the legal status of Hyderabad before deciding whether it had the authority to handle the case. However, some representatives argued that the question of the Security Council's authority should be decided later. A vote was taken, and it was passed to include the Hyderabad case on the agenda.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting at 3:30 PM this afternoon to try to prevent Indian aggression against Hyderabad before further bloodshed occurs.</p>
<p>Major powers have remained silent on how they hope to restore peace in Hyderabad, but they have clearly decided to bring the dispute to a public vote to avert more serious trends.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed regret in the House of Commons regarding India's "belligerent" attitude toward Hyderabad, saying, "In that place, it is equally unknown how it will end." He stated that Britain believes the India-Hyderabad dispute should be submitted to the United Nations, but he did not intend to comment further, as Sir Gladwyn Jebb would preside over the Hyderabad issue at the Security Council in Paris on the 16th.</p>

<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 16th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall declared in Washington that the United States is quite concerned about the Hyderabad situation but denied rumors that the U.S. would submit the matter to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris. An important declaration is expected to be issued from Karachi, the capital of Pakistan.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Soviet Union Controls Southeast Asia Intelligence Bureau, Strengthening Soviet Position in the Far East to Gain a Voice in Far East Peace Conference <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Well-informed sources declared on the 16th that, according to secret information from the Far East, the Southeast Asia branch of the Comintern Intelligence Bureau began operations in May. It is speculated that the headquarters of the Southeast Asia branch is located within the Soviet embassy in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, as the Soviet Union maintains approximately 40 people within the embassy, despite having no significant economic interests in Thailand.</p>
<p>U.S. officials stated that since the Soviet embassy was established in Bangkok in May, communist activities in Southeast Asia have become increasingly active. The scope of the Comintern Intelligence Bureau's Southeast Asia branch is generally believed to include Thailand, Burma, Malaya, Indochina, and the East Indies. In each of these regions, communist-inspired disturbances erupted one after another during the summer, and in Indonesia, the peaceful efforts of the United Nations Committee of Good Offices were severely undermined. According to information obtained here, the strategy adopted by the communists in Asian colonial regions is no different from that in Europe. In each region, all activities are directed by one or more Soviet-trained personnel. Such personnel may hold official positions or may be underground operatives. For example, in French Indochina, Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Viet Minh Republic, studied in Moscow for four years; in Indonesia, the cunning indigenous leader Alimin was trained by the Soviets. Diplomats here believe that the communist activities are intended to strengthen the Soviet Union's mandate to gain a voice in the Far East peace conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had already declared that, based on the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan, the Soviet Union should be granted a major role, including veto power, in the final peace in Asia, a stance firmly opposed by the four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and France.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] Diplomatic sources here stated that Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker is scheduled to fly from The Hague to the United States on the afternoon of the 16th and will meet with Secretary of State Marshall on the same day to discuss the growing "Indonesian Communist activities." This sudden and unannounced visit is of great significance, and the Dutch government apparently believes it necessary to send Stikker before the United Nations General Assembly convenes in Paris.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] A few days before the opening of the General Assembly in Paris, the Soviet Union reopened the issue on the 16th, again proposing a global disarmament plan that encompasses East-West disputes. Western countries, citing the current international situation, argued earlier this year that a slight reduction in armaments was impossible and prompted the adjournment of the United Nations Commission for Conventional Armaments. Now, Soviet representative Malik is requesting an early convening of the commission. The commission, composed of eleven countries and identical to the Security Council, must meet at least once before the General Assembly opens on the 21st. The commission will hear reports reflecting the vastly different views of the West and the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Political Crisis Remains Latent; French Labor Unrest on the Rise; New Cabinet Under Attack from Both Left and Right <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] Communist-led French workers launched a series of new strikes on the 16th, bringing the number of striking workers close to 200,000, in an attempt to undermine Prime Minister Queuille's austere new economic plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] The strike that brought the Renault factory to a standstill on the 15th will spread to all steel factories in the Paris region this afternoon. The strike by ground staff at Air France, which began on the afternoon of the 15th, has not yet resumed this morning. Union sources emphasize that although the current labor unrest is still partial in nature, the general trend of demanding wage increases cannot be ignored. The Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), currently controlled by the communists, is the main force supporting the union strikes.</p>
<p>Yesterday's clash between 2,000 workers and 600 police officers at the Snark aircraft factory in central Paris has further altered the political situation and may have an adverse impact on monetary issues and cabinet stability. Observers here point out that under the dual impact of the economic situation and worker demands, the cabinet may lose some supporters in parliament when it seeks parliamentary authorization to increase the tax burden on taxpayers. In this difficult situation, the French Communist Party and the Gaullists are launching a full-scale offensive against the current cabinet. The French Communist Party is convening meetings across the country, calling for the formation of a new government that includes the Communist Party. On the other hand, the Gaullists are marching in southern France, launching a "Save France" movement.</p>

<p>Residents of the Island Lean Towards Communism</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The Japanese government and the Allied Headquarters are now paying attention to the independence movement in Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. The authorities have begun investigating the source of recent propaganda books promoting the island's independence, believing that there are several reasons why the islanders' dissatisfaction with the authorities has formed the basis for the independence movement. Although the independence movement in Hokkaido is not currently considered a serious problem, both the Japanese government and the Allied Headquarters are deeply concerned because a large percentage of the island's residents are communists or sympathizers.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation Regulations Approved <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] The "Supplementary Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation Regulations" submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, after review by the Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan, have been revised to the following points for supplementation, which were submitted to the 8th Temporary Meeting of the Executive Yuan for resolution: (1) The title is changed to "Implementation Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation Regulations." (2) The standards for dividing the amount of goods transacted and wages and freight received, as well as the amount of fines, in the original regulations should be re-drafted. Subsequently, the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan and the Secretariat of the Economic Control Committee, together with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, amended the original measures accordingly. The Executive Yuan has now approved them and presented a report at the political affairs meeting on the 15th. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All cities and counties nationwide are designated as areas for implementing price limits and price negotiation.</p>
<p>(2) The prices of goods nationwide should be based on the publicly traded prices in the local market on August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar), after conversion to gold yuan at the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Local competent authorities may designate certain types of goods for strict control, depending on the actual supply and demand situation in the area.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding businesses related to people's daily lives, such as hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, barbershops, tailors, laundries, transportation, clinics, hospitals, and movie theaters, the provisions of the preceding article apply, and prices should be controlled.</p>
<p>(4) If, for special reasons, it is necessary to adjust the prices of goods and business operations stipulated in the preceding two or three articles, the local competent authority may organize a Price Evaluation Committee, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Price Evaluation Implementation Regulations, to negotiate fair prices, report them to the local competent authority for approval, and submit them to the competent higher-level authority for record, unless otherwise stipulated by law.</p>
<p>If the prices adjusted before August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar) are excessively high, the local competent authority may re-evaluate them in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph and reduce them.</p>
<p>(5) From August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar), any of the following circumstances shall be deemed a violation of price limits:</p>
<p>(1) The transaction prices of goods and the prices of business operations related to people's daily lives in various places, without the approval of the local superior authorities, exceed the prices converted to gold yuan according to the exchange rate on August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar).</p>
<p>(2) Goods converted to gold yuan according to the exchange rate from August 19, 1937 (Republican calendar) are changed in name, quality, quantity, or price for sale, or the prices converted to gold yuan are not marked as required, or they are secretly sold at high prices.</p>
<p>(3) Other violations of the provisions on price limits and price negotiation.</p>
<p>(6) Article 6, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the Regulations for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation are amended to use 500 gold yuan as the dividing standard. If the price exceeds the negotiated price and the circumstances are serious, or the value of the goods transacted and the wages and freight received is 500 gold yuan or more, it shall be handled in accordance with paragraph 2. If the price exceeds the negotiated price and the value of the goods transacted or the wages and freight received is less than 500 gold yuan, it shall be handled in accordance with paragraph 3.</p>
<p>(Note: The dividing standard stipulated in the regulations is "50,000 yuan," and the original proposal was to change it to "2,000 gold yuan," which would be too high. However, if it is converted according to the price index at the time the original regulations were promulgated, the "50,000 yuan" at that time would only be equivalent to 101.4 gold yuan, which would also be too low. Therefore, it was agreed to revise the proposal as above.)</p>
<p>(7) The fines imposed in accordance with the Regulations for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiation shall be allocated as follows, unless handled by the judicial authorities in accordance with the law: 50% shall be used as rewards, and the remaining 50% shall be turned over to the local government treasury.</p>
<p>(8) The local competent authorities responsible for suppressing violations of price limits and price negotiation shall be the Social Affairs Bureau or Social Affairs Department (in conjunction with the public security and police authorities) in municipalities directly under the central government and provincial capitals, and the county or city governments in counties and cities.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Change of Command at Songhu Garrison Headquarters; Jiang Jingguo Internally Appointed as Successor; Xuan Tiewu Transferred to Deputy Director of Quzhou Pacification Headquarters <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Xuan Tiewu's request to resign as commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has been approved, and he has been transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters. Jiang Jingguo has been internally appointed to fill the vacancy of Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. This news has been confirmed to our reporter by Commander Xuan himself. According to Xuan, the responsibilities of the Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters are heavy, and he had intended to resign for some time, but he was not permitted by the President. Before the currency reform, he went to Moganshan to visit the President and request to resign, but the President still did not approve. After returning to Shanghai, he telegraphed the President again, reiterating his previous request. He recently received news from Nanjing that his resignation had been approved, and the President has issued a handwritten order to the Ministry of National Defense. The official order should arrive in Shanghai in about three or four days, and he can be said to have achieved his wish. He has now ordered the heads of various departments of the Garrison Headquarters to prepare for the handover. When asked to express his feelings, Xuan humbly stated that since coming to Shanghai three years ago, he has been grateful for the assistance of the citizens of Shanghai. He feels ashamed to leave before the security of Shanghai has been consolidated. He believes that Jiang Jingguo will have a good performance in the future.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, people here have expressed excitement about Jiang Jingguo's internal appointment as Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. However, Jiang has not made any statement regarding this news. According to well-informed sources, the Songhu area may implement total war earlier after Jiang takes over as Garrison Commander. Jiang himself will be responsible for political and economic aspects, while military aspects may be the responsibility of the Deputy Commander. It is said that the candidate for Deputy Commander has also been internally appointed.</p>

<p>Since the President instructed the people in his broadcast the other day that they should build the nation through diligence and frugality, all sectors of the city were deeply moved upon hearing it. It is heard that the Kuomintang City Party Department, as well as the Youth Party and Democratic Socialist Party's two city party departments and various organizations, will hold a meeting next week to discuss the implementation of diligence and frugality in nation-building. In addition, the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party's city party departments telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan yesterday, and telegraphed various public organizations nationwide, expressing their sincere support for the diligence and frugality nation-building movement, and appealing to patriotic compatriots nationwide to unite and strive together to respond, make a firm decision, and strive to rise up. The original telegram stated: "To President Chiang of the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, and the various newspapers, public opinion organizations, and organizations of all kinds: In recent years, our country's production has shrunk, national strength has declined, the lives of the people are as fragile as silk, and the national soul is about to be severed. This is directly due to the rebellion of traitors, the sabotage of spies, and the destruction caused, but the decline of social morals and the immersion of people's hearts in extravagance, luxury, and material desires are also the fundamental factors that have created this phenomenon. The President has unique insight and foresight, and with the enthusiasm to save the country and the people, has issued the call to build the nation through diligence and frugality. His words are earnest and deeply relevant to the current ills, and the ten articles of the covenant he has revealed are a panacea for correcting the times and a good prescription for saving the country. Diligence increases production, and frugality conserves consumption. The way to implement it lies in active work, respecting time, eliminating corruption, and abstaining from extravagance. If everyone can make a firm decision, strive to rise up, encourage and emulate each other, and believe and act together, then the transformation of social morals will not take long, and the restoration of national fortunes can be expected soon. We, deeply mindful of the President's expectations and closely observing the needs of society, will not only sincerely support this movement and supervise our party members to vigorously promote it, but also hope that the people of the country, patriotic compatriots, will unite and strive together. The future of the nation depends on it. A special telegram conveys our thoughts. We hope you will understand. The Shanghai City Party Departments of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese Youth Party, and the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party kowtow, Shen Xianyin."</p>
<p>Moreover, all sectors of the city were deeply moved upon hearing the President's broadcast the previous evening advocating diligence and frugality in nation-building. Yesterday (the 16th), they respectfully telegraphed their support. The original text is as follows: "To President Chiang of the Presidential Palace in Nanjing: The root of our country's illness today lies in the disturbances caused by the treacherous Communist bandits and the malfeasance of treacherous merchants and corrupt officials, but the degeneration of social morals, corruption, extravagance, and waste are also contributing factors. The way to save the situation requires a thorough transformation of the public and private lives of the people. Your Excellency, with high courage and foresight, illuminates the profound and advocates economic reform first, followed by frugality and diligence. Treating both the symptoms and the root causes, applying both the essence and the function, your painstaking efforts are admired by all in government and the public. Since receiving the decree to reform the currency system and strictly enforce frugality, this council and others have loudly appealed and widely promoted it, with the aim of warning the world and awakening the masses, and reversing the declining trend. Upon hearing Your Excellency's training on the diligence and frugality nation-building movement, the words are earnest and thought-provoking, enough to inspire the weak and establish the cowardly, and bring the dead back to life. We pledge to support it with sincerity, intensify publicity, promote organization, follow the outline, and universally implement it, so that this epoch-making social revolution movement can be completed quickly and continued without interruption. A respectful telegram is presented, respectfully requesting your attention. The Shanghai City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Federation of Labor Unions, the Women's Association, the Journalists Association, the Education Association, the Farmers Association, Shen Xuan kowtow."</p>

<h3 id="e88">This Month's Rice Rationing Extended to the End of the Month <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In the past, rice rationing in the city started on the first of each month, but this month's rice rationing was delayed until the sixth of the month due to waiting for central approval. Many citizens feel that the shortened time is inconvenient for those with weak economic conditions and request an extension until the end of the month. The Civil Survey Council also recognizes this need and has approved the extension to the 30th of this month. Now, it is only waiting for the approval of Wu, who is also the chairman, before it can be officially announced. In order to strengthen its work and eliminate corruption, the association has now decided to revoke the rationing rights of rice shops or send them to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action if necessary, depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Express Dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th] According to the Executive Yuan's report from the Ministry of Finance: In accordance with the provisions of the Supplementary Measures for Financial Consolidation, the method of collecting the Category 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax is divided into two halves of the year, and the detailed measures for declaration and estimated payment should be determined. Therefore, a "Draft Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year" was prepared and submitted for review, and a request was made to abolish the previously promulgated Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan, in addition to abolishing the Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year, has approved the Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year proposed by the Ministry of Finance, and a report was made at the 16th meeting of the Yuan this month on the 15th. The full text of the measures is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Article 1 These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of Section 1 of the "Supplementary Measures for Financial Consolidation" promulgated by the President on August 26, 37.</p>
<p>Article 2 Public and private profit-seeking enterprises shall calculate their income for the two halves of the 37th year separately and declare their income in the prescribed format to the local competent collection agency before the end of September and the end of February of the following year.</p>
<p>Article 3 The profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 37th year is divided into two installments. The tax paid in the first half of the 37th year based on the estimated payable profit tax for the 36th year is the first installment tax for the 37th year. The tax levied in the second half of the 37th year based on the profit income of the first half of the year is the second installment tax for the 37th year.</p>
<p>Article 4 The collection of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the two installments of the 37th year shall be in accordance with the following provisions:</p>
<p>(1) If the first installment of tax has not been paid in full according to the estimated payment amount, penalties shall be imposed and it shall be recovered in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(2) For those who declare within the time limit, the competent collection agency shall assess the tax based on the declared income amount and notify the taxpayer to pay within the time limit.</p>
<p>(3) Those who do not declare their income for the first half of the year within the time limit but do not fall under the provisions of Article 10 of these measures, the competent collection agency shall estimate the amount of tax payable according to the provisions of Article 5 of these measures.</p>
<p>(4) Those who have paid the first installment of tax and paid the estimated tax amount for the second half of the 37th year within the time limit shall be exempt from tax audit and shall be exempt from their tax obligations other than the estimated tax paid for the 36th year's income.</p>
<p>(5) Those who have had their first installment of tax audited, paid supplementary tax, and paid it shall be allowed to offset the supplementary tax portion as the payable tax due for the second half of the 37th year.</p>
<p>(6) Taxpayers who disagree with the estimated tax amount for the first installment of this year and have paid it within the time limit shall apply to the local competent collection agency for tax audit and assessment before the end of September and be refunded or compensated according to the law, but only if they possess complete account books as stipulated in Articles 13 and 14 of the Income Tax Law.</p>
<p>Article 5 The estimation of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the second half of the 37th year shall be based on the principle of determining the tax payable by each unit by establishing standards for different industries. For industries without industry association organizations or commercial firms that have not joined industry associations, the competent collection agency shall classify them into relevant industries according to their business nature.</p>
<p>Each industry and commerce association shall submit a roster of the names, addresses, responsible persons, and estimated sales or operating income for the half-year (banking, trust industries, and companies registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall also report the actual amount of capital) of its members before October 16th, and distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of the business conditions of each taxpayer unit by means of a scoring method, and report it to the local competent collection agency for review. The aforementioned scoring method shall be resolved by the board of directors of each industry association.</p>
<p>If the industry association fails to submit a roster of member scores within the time limit, the competent collection agency may directly or indirectly investigate and estimate it by analogy to the commercial conditions of industries with similar natures.</p>
<p>Article 6 The competent collection agency shall estimate the income amount of taxpayers in the first half of the thirty-seventh year and the tax amount payable for the second half of the thirty-seventh year based on the roster reported by the aforementioned association and collect the following information:</p>
<p>(1) A comparison of the prices of major commodities in each industry based on January 37th as the base period with the multiple increases in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>(2) Import and export data from customs and entry-exit management agencies.</p>
<p>(3) Commercial condition data of various industries compiled by public and private statistical and economic research institutions and credit bureaus.</p>
<p>(4) Production and sales data of various goods subject to commodity tax.</p>
<p>(5) Opinions of scholars, experts, and leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors on general commercial conditions and prices.</p>
<p>Article 7 Each taxpayer shall pay the full amount of tax estimated by the competent collection agency in accordance with the preceding article within half a month of the arrival of the tax payment notice. Those who fail to pay within the time limit shall be punished in accordance with Article 156 of the Income Tax Law.</p>
<p>Article 8 The tax amount estimated by the competent collection agency in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 of these measures shall be regarded as the tax amount payable as investigated and verified in accordance with the Income Tax Law. Taxpayers who disagree with the estimated tax amount shall pay the full amount of tax and, within 20 days after the tax payment deadline, submit a written request to the local competent collection agency for reconsideration. Those who fail to pay the tax in full or fail to apply for reconsideration within the time limit will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Article 9 The levy of profit-seeking enterprise income for the second half of the 37th year of state-run enterprises run by government agencies, profit-seeking enterprises jointly run by the government and the people, and companies that have not joined industry associations shall still be subject to tax audit.</p>
<p>Article 10 For industries whose tax payable cannot be estimated in accordance with Article 6 of these measures, with the approval of the competent collection agency, they may request a sample audit of the accounts of at least 5% of the commercial firms in each industry to serve as a reference for calculating the standard sales amount (income amount), standard sales expense rate (income expense rate), and standard sales net profit rate (net income), and refer to the information in the aforementioned member roster to determine the tax estimation standard.</p>
<p>Article 11 The sample audit of the account books of commercial firms in various industries shall be determined by lottery. The selected units shall bring all their account books and statements to the competent collection agency within the specified time limit to await investigation and tax audit. Those who fail to send their accounts for verification in accordance with the prescribed time shall, in addition to selecting other units for account submission, directly determine the income amount and the tax amount payable by the unit and impose penalties in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>For industries with no account books or incomplete account books that are insufficient for sample audit, the business conditions of the industry in the first half of this year may be used as a reference to the business conditions of industries with similar natures to estimate the various standard ratios for tax calculation.</p>
<p>Profit-seeking enterprises engaged in sideline businesses may refer to the business conditions of the enterprise in the first half of this year and refer to its main business to estimate its tax estimation standard.</p>
<p>Article 12 These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

The common people yearn for the authorities to take decisive action and search for it. Also, recently there has been a major firewood shortage in Baozhen. On the afternoon of the 14th, a firewood boat came from the north of the town, preparing to export. Upon hearing the news, residents rose up to stop it.

<h3 id="e96">Implementation Period of Measures for Permitting Outbound Transportation of Goods Temporarily Delayed to Prevent the Evasion of Price Fluctuations by Goods from This Port <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After the publication of the measures for permitting the outbound transportation of goods, prices stirred again yesterday. Seeing the potential for profit, merchants competed to purchase goods, causing gauze and other items to rise to the price limit again. In view of this, Supervisor Jiang, in order to prevent such a situation, instructed the responsible personnel of the Goods Adjustment Committee yesterday morning to temporarily delay the issuance of the measures to various agencies in order to postpone their implementation period. At the same time, the Goods Adjustment Committee, because the prices of goods in other ports are recently higher than those in Shanghai, if the flow of goods is allowed, the existing goods in this city will inevitably use various means to escape in large quantities. Therefore, a meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss the issue of the flow of goods between districts at length.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Shanghai District's Measures for Inspecting and Prohibiting the Outbound Transportation of Goods, which was previously approved and announced by the Inspection Committee, was given a detailed explanation of the prohibited items listed in Article 3 of the measures by the committee yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton refers to raw cotton that can be used for weaving; waste cotton is not included.</p>
<p>(2) Cotton cloth does not include hand-woven cloth and other cotton textiles.</p>
<p>(3) Paper does not include cigarette paper, yellow printing paper, superstitious paper, and homemade grass paper.</p>
<p>(4) Soda refers to soap for washing and soda ash for making soap; other types of alkali other than scented soap, medicinal soap, and caustic soda are not included.</p>
<p>(5) Leather refers to raw and tanned leather; leather products are not included.</p>
<p>(6) Rubber refers to raw, old, and waste rubber; rubber products are not included.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Public Confidence and Active Replenishment Lead to Comprehensive Increase in Cotton Yarn Prices; Cloth Market Remains Stable with Prices Retreating from Peak <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation, because concrete measures have been obtained for yarn exports, public confidence turned excited, and merchants from other ports actively replenished their stocks. Local textile manufacturers and practical manufacturers rushed to purchase, and the trend suddenly became brisk.</p>
<p>There was not much fine yarn available on the market, and all grades were traded at the limit price. The Shuangma yarn factory had 21-count yarn for sale, which was traded at 775 yuan. The 20-count yarn sold very well, and merchants from other ports added to their purchases. All dealers repeatedly traded at the limit price. The asking prices for 16-count and 10-count combed yarn also showed a slight firmness.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Textile Construction Company continued to offer 20-count Wuzi, Hong Kuixing, and Tiannv yarns, a total of eight types, priced at 707 yuan, with 431 pieces traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation, because the implementation of the export measures is pending, brokers were ordered to only sell on behalf of companies with licenses and not to purchase on behalf of others. The chairman of the association advised fellow merchants not to raise prices. Public confidence on the trading floor was therefore stable, and local goods brought in were mutually sold off.</p>
<p>The initial price of Longtou fine cloth fell by 400 yuan. It turned brisk at one point in the middle, but as traders took profits near the close, the price returned to 28.4 yuan at the close, a decrease of 200 yuan from the previous day. The mid-range Wufu fine cloth plunged by 1 yuan, and Laba Tong fell by 900 yuan, but the B-brand Laba Tong alone rose by 1 yuan. In addition, Sijunzi serge and white cloth were also sluggish. A total of 1,300 bolts were traded citywide.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Textile Construction Company offered 12-pound Longtou B fine cloth, priced at 24.7 yuan, as well as Taoyuan Tu Yuan fine cloth and Sijunzi Zhigong wool and colored quilt covers, a total of fourteen types, but there were very few applicants.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Yarn Industry Asks China Textile Corporation to Lower Yarn Allocation Prices <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of various yarn factories and the Yarn Industry Association to discuss issues related to yarn allocation. The Yarn Industry Association made three specific recommendations to China Textile Corporation regarding yarn sales in the future: (1) The current price of 20-count yarn sold by China Textile Corporation is set at 707 yuan, which means that all yarn industry colleagues will lose 25 yuan per piece of yarn, including all donations and expenses. Please reduce the price of allocated yarn appropriately in the future. (2) The supply is too small, especially for those with retail outlets. Because market demand has increased, but the allocation of goods by China Textile Corporation is insufficient, there is a trend of supply not meeting demand. Please increase the number of allocated yarn pieces in the future. (3) China Textile Corporation's own yarn production is too small and should be increased appropriately. China Textile Corporation promised to consider these recommendations.</p>

From September 17th, the daily interest rate on loans was changed to 2.2 yuan per thousand, the daily interest rate on deposits was changed to 700 yuan per thousand, and the daily interest rate among colleagues was changed to 1.6 yuan per thousand.</p>

<p>Liu Gongyun and Seven Others Elected as Committee Members</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee was officially established at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, and the first meeting was held, chaired by Liu Gongyun. The important matters discussed and resolved were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Liu Gongyun, Li Lixia, Dong Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, and Wang Lanseng were elected as members of the Joint Purchasing Committee, with Liu Gongyun concurrently serving as chairman and Li Lixia concurrently serving as vice chairman.</p>
<p>(2) The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office was established, with two departments: Business and Finance. The headquarters is located in Shanghai, with Wu Weijing concurrently serving as general manager and Liu Jingji as deputy general manager. A branch will be established in Hankou, and candidates for the branch are pending.</p>
<p>(3) One point of importance has been modified in the original decision on the various key points of the Joint Purchasing Committee, which is the provision that all state-produced cotton in Shanghai and Hankou will be uniformly purchased.</p>
<p>(4) The cotton purchasing fund is set at 100 million yuan, to be shared equally by the Central Bank and state-owned yarn factories.</p>
<p>(5) The Joint Purchasing Committee will hold meetings once every Tuesday, and the Joint Purchasing Office will actively prepare immediately. Work will commence next week.</p>
<p>(6) The business plan will be drafted by the general manager and deputy general manager, and submitted to the committee for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Prices Too High in Production Areas, Export Business Declines <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the export business in this city has once again shown a declining trend, with a significant reduction compared to the beginning of the currency system reform. The reason for this is that the prices of various export goods in the production areas have risen too much, while the prices in Shanghai are stable. For example, tung oil produced in Wanxian, Sichuan, is priced at 74 gold yuan per ton, while the selling price in this city is only 70 yuan per ton. Pig bristles produced in Bengbu, which are 3.5 inches long, are priced at 2,000 yuan per simadan, while the selling price in this city is only 1,400 yuan per simadan. Mao tea produced in Pingshui is priced at 80 yuan per dan, while the price of box tea made from processed Mao tea in Pingshui in Shanghai is only 100 yuan. In fact, the processing fee for Mao tea to make box tea is definitely above 20 yuan. Compared with the prices in the production areas and the market prices in this city, plus the transportation costs, the difference is too great, so exporters are unwilling to purchase goods from the production areas. Currently, what is being exported is the goods stockpiled by the merchants in the past, which will be sold out in a short period of time. Exporters are now extremely hopeful that the authorities can suppress the prices of goods in the production areas, otherwise the prices of export goods in this city will definitely be affected, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Money Market Remains Surprisingly Loose, Mid-Autumn Festival Smoothly Navigated <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Today is the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. The markets for rice, grains, flour, cotton yarn, cooking oil, soybean cake, and other goods are closed for the day as usual, but the silver money industry and the cotton cloth market remain open as usual. Although yesterday was the day before the festival, the money market remained extremely loose. Banks felt there were too many orders and found it difficult to lend out money. This phenomenon of surprisingly loose money market during the festival season is rare, so industrial and commercial sectors are not feeling any difficulty in dealing with their cash flow and can smoothly spend the festival without any unexpected events. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus paid out another 1.62 million yuan, including 200,000 yuan from the Central Bank, 680,000 yuan from the Bank of China, 230,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, 720,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank, 50,000 yuan from the China Trust Bureau, 270,000 yuan from the Postal Savings Bureau, and 270,000 yuan from the Cooperative Treasury, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e103">New Shipment of Red Tea Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Domestic sales of red and green tea remained undiminished yesterday, but the market atmosphere continued to fluctuate due to the guaranteed supply. As for the foreign tea market, it continued to trend slightly upwards, mainly because holders of goods felt that the demand from exporters was strong and the market inventory was extremely low. Therefore, the attitude was healthy and stable, and the asking prices remained at a high point.</p>
<p>It is learned that the first batch of several hundred boxes of red tea made by the Qimen Jiangjunqiao Cooperative this year arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is being sold by the Taishi Anhui Tea Company. It is reported that British merchants Jardine Matheson and Ewo have already inspected the goods. It is said that they are still satisfied with the goods, and they are currently planning to approach the seller for negotiations. It is expected that a formal transaction can be obtained after the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Rice Market Slightly Firm, New Flour Prices Approved by the Social Affairs Bureau <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The rice market saw a slight rise, due to strong quotations from Wuxi, and the rise of various goods outside the industry in recent days, public confidence was solidified, coupled with the meager arrivals and the daily depletion of market stocks, the market trend was thereby firm. The increase in Japonica rice was greater, with high-grade goods rising by 10-200 yuan, and medium and inferior goods rising by 200-300 yuan. Special Japonica rice in the North Market was 22.4 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan.

<h3 id="e106">False Reporting of Foreign Exchange by Banks; Decision to Revoke Licenses According to Law <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Financial Minister Hsu Pai-yuan came to Shanghai to supervise the transfer of foreign exchange matters by commercial banks in the city, the registration work has been completed, and the transfer work is also actively underway. However, the foreign exchange figures reported by the various banks, with the exception of the reputable large banks, are mostly inaccurate. Therefore, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau has instructed the Bankers Association to notify its members to make additional corrections, with a deadline of the 30th of this month. Those who fail to report by the deadline or who deliberately provide false information will have their licenses revoked according to law. The original telegram from the Executive Yuan is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to Article 5 of the Regulations for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Stored Abroad by the People of the Republic of China, all citizens of the Republic of China, except those whose habitual residence is abroad and are considered overseas Chinese, shall, by December 31, 1948, register and declare their foreign exchange assets stored abroad up to August 20, 1948, to the Central Bank or its entrusted banks, in accordance with the prescribed forms. Foreign exchange assets acquired after August 21, 1948, must be declared and registered within two months from the date of acquisition. Considering the need for early registration of foreign exchange assets held abroad by domestic banks and money houses, it is hereby stipulated that the declaration and registration of their foreign exchange assets held abroad by banks and money houses must be completed by September 30, 1948. Those who fail to declare or provide false information will be deemed to have violated economic control laws, and their business licenses will be revoked or they will be suspended from business upon verification. Those who violate Article 8 of the same regulations by transferring foreign exchange assets to any natural person, legal person, or other organization abroad with the intention of avoiding declaration and registration from August 20, 1948, will be severely punished in accordance with Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing National Mobilization Law, as stipulated in Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the same regulations, once verified.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Revision of Elementary School Curriculum Standards: Only Objectives and Outlines Listed for Each Subject; Simplified Content with Flexibility for Local Adaptation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report from Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Education's revised elementary school curriculum standards have now been approved and promulgated. It is reported that the revisions aim for simplification, with each subject only listing objectives and outlines. Implementation measures, revision process, and key teaching points for each subject will be detailed in a separate "Interpretation of Elementary School Curriculum Standards".</p>
<p>The revisions have the following characteristics: (1) Recognizing that the curriculum standard is different from the curriculum itself. The curriculum is the school's course progress, while the curriculum standard is the standard for the curriculum. In other words, it is the standard for measuring the curriculum, not the curriculum itself. Therefore, the revisions are abstract and concise, with flexibility so that each region can create its own appropriate curriculum based on the standards and apply them accordingly. It also has permanence and can be implemented for many years without the need for modification to avoid constant changes. (2) Reduce weekly teaching time for each grade as much as possible to ease the burden on children. Extracurricular group activities will also be included in the timetable to ensure schools pay attention to such activities. (3) Restore civic training. The elementary school curriculum standards revised in 1932 not only taught civic knowledge in elementary common sense and advanced social studies subjects, but also established civic training with set training standards to guide children in practice. The curriculum standards revised in 1942 divided these training standards into two types: moral education standards and hygiene training standards. Now, they are combined into one, and regulations that are difficult for children to understand are all removed. (4) Stipulate that separate textbooks can still be compiled for Chinese and common sense for subject-based teaching. Common sense in the first and second grades does not use textbooks; teachers educate based on separately compiled teaching methods. (5) Stipulate that arithmetic will be formally taught from the third grade. The first and second grades will switch to incidental teaching, and no specific teaching time is specified in "Subjects and Time". (6) Restore the art subject, merging drawing into the art subject to expand the scope and pay attention to aesthetic cultivation, rather than just focusing on drawing techniques. (7) The music and physical education subjects in the first and second grades will still be combined into the "Singing Games" subject, and the manual labor and art subjects will still be combined into the "Manual Labor" subject to strengthen joint teaching and adapt to the level of young children.</p>

Next, Hu Jiajian reported on the process by which representatives of professors' associations from various colleges and universities in the capital requested the government to adjust the treatment of public and private education personnel and the subsidy for professors' academic research. Finally, the meeting discussed association affairs: Hu Huanyong, Li Peilin, Chen Bangjie, Shao Heting, Li Xucui, Huang Xiaqian, Wei Huilin, and Li Jingchen spoke in succession, providing some opinions on the school's affairs. Regarding the government's implementation of currency system reform and the excessively low standards for the treatment of public and private education personnel and the research subsidies for professors, all the colleagues of the university's professors' association unanimously expressed dissatisfaction. The meeting resolved that the council should be responsible for jointly negotiating actively with the government authorities with the already published principles for adjusting treatment, together with the professors' associations of various national colleges and universities, and not stop until the goal is achieved.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The fee standards for public and private primary and secondary schools in the city were previously determined by Mayor Wu and Education Bureau Director Li after convening a symposium with various education groups. For private schools, the fees were set at: primary school, Gold Yuan 20-30; junior high school, Gold Yuan 35-50; senior high school, Gold Yuan 45-60. To thoroughly implement this decision, the Education Bureau has issued a notice to all schools in the city to strictly comply and dispatched personnel to various schools for investigation to prevent any cases of outward compliance but inward disobedience. It has now come to light that the private Peicheng Girls' Primary and Secondary School on Xikang Road has violated the prescribed standards. It charged 72 Gold Yuan for senior high school, overcharging 12 Yuan; 60 Yuan for junior high school, overcharging 10 Yuan; 48 Yuan for primary school, overcharging 18 Yuan; and 50 Yuan for kindergarten, overcharging 20 Yuan. After being reported by citizens and verified by the Education Bureau, the school has been strictly ordered to refund the overcharged amounts to the students in full within five days of receiving the order.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Table tennis champion Ye Guanxiong encountered a formidable opponent in the semi-finals of the open senior singles yesterday. He battled Wang Wenzheng for two hours, with each winning two sets, resulting in a stalemate. Due to darkness, the final set was postponed to 5 PM today at the Youth Tennis Club. Spectators holding yesterday's ticket stubs do not need to purchase new tickets. A semi-final match in the intermediate singles category was also held before yesterday's match, with the following results:</p>
<p>Intermediate Singles Semi-Final</p>
<p>Senior Singles Semi-Final</p>
<p>Yesterday's score was unexpected to most spectators. Ye Guanxiong found himself in a difficult battle, while veteran Wang Wenzheng was not old, and his unexpected great shots appeared frequently. Ye won the first set too easily, and was careless in the second set, and unable to recover. In the third set, Ye also showed signs of fatigue, and Wang Wenzheng seized the opportunity to progress, which was the key to yesterday's victory or defeat. In terms of the situation, it was evenly matched.</p>
<p>In the first set, Ye Guanxiong's ingenious drop shots and accurate diagonal long shots made Wang Wenzheng exhausted and at a loss. After 0-2, Ye won the next six games. He did not exert his full strength in the second set, performing loosely. Wang Wenzheng tied the score with 6-4. The third set was one of Wang Wenzheng's most brilliant performances in recent years. His fierce forehand shots made Ye Guanxiong's net play and short balls ineffective. Amidst the thunderous cheers of the audience, he defeated his struggling opponent with 7-5 after tying four times. The fourth set was the only lifeline for Ye Guanxiong, so he made a desperate effort. Wang Wenzheng, on the other hand, was already exhausted due to his excessive fatness, and his clothes were soaked. Ye Guanxiong swept away the remaining obstacles and tied the game.</p>

<h3 id="e118">World Games Football Team Has Done Its Best; Rong Qizhao Reported on the Process Before and After the Trip Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Dr. Rong Qizhao, leader of the Chinese World Games football team, hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday at 4:00 PM, giving a very detailed report on the team's trip to England. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The football team received a warm welcome and hospitality from overseas Chinese and our embassies along the way. The original schedule of 25 matches was increased by 10 to a total of 35 matches, with 25 wins, 5 losses, and 5 draws. After arriving in England, they won a friendly match against the United States and lost to Turkey in the World Games. On the way back home, they won all five matches.</p>
<p>(2) The football team's organization was simple and democratic, with only Rong himself serving as the leader and Li Huitang as the coach. A five-member executive committee was also established to handle the team's affairs, consisting of Rong, Li, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, and Zhang Banglun. Yan Shixin and Ye Qingrong were appointed as accountants to keep the books open to the public.</p>
<p>(3) The football team had not a penny to its name when it set off. The National Sports Association did not provide any subsidies. Rong borrowed 60,000 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Football Association donated 16,000 yuan, and the Hong Kong ball game earned 14,000 yuan, totaling 90,000 Hong Kong dollars. After paying for air tickets, only a few thousand yuan were left. The tour game earned a total of 267,000 yuan. In Calcutta, paid for the board and lodging of the delegation and the travel expenses of the basketball team, and brought the track and field representatives back, which resulted in owing the plane ticket money to Tongjilong when leaving England. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there were still more than 20,000 yuan borrowed in Hong Kong that could not be repaid. The football team itself was not in debt, but the delegation was in debt. It was originally planned to go to the Philippines to raise money to pay off debts when returning home, but the team could not make the trip due to the rainy season in Manila. It can be said that the football team has done its best for the entire delegation.</p>
<p>(4) Hao Gengsheng's donation in Nanyang only accounted for more than 400 pounds. The delegation in London had to spend more than 120 pounds a day. Team members had no pocket money, and travel expenses ran out. The head coach and his wife even lived in expensive hotels. When the delegation arrived in Calcutta, there were only more than 30 pounds left, which shows how embarrassing the situation was.</p>
<p>(5) Impressions of participating in the World Games football: European football has progressed rapidly, and their physical strength and endurance are amazing. They can kick for one or two hours without reducing speed, and they don't care at all. Our country's defeat was due to insufficient endurance and physical strength. They were not used to playing in the rain, and the more they kicked in the rain, the heavier they became, and the heavier they became, the less they could move. European countries all employ British professional coaches, and the results are impressive. What the football team can be gratified about is that the whole team is harmonious and cooperative, and their spirit is excellent.</p>

<p>-- Ji Yong</p>
<p>There has always been a saying: "Even heroes have a hard time getting past the beauties." Or, elegantly: "Heroes are short of breath, but full of love for their children." This shortcoming, developed from the primitive instincts of mankind - the so-called "food and sex, the greatest desires of man" - is really impossible to control, and perhaps this is why it can be forgiven.</p>
<p>"Three thousand beauties in the harem" is certainly inhumane and barbaric; but it does not hinder the "king's affairs." What is to be feared is that "three thousand favors are concentrated on one person," which is sure to be terrible. Although ancient history is not entirely reliable, the facts of ancient history are inevitably the result of later generations tracing cats and drawing tigers. For example, the fall of Jie of Xia and Zhou of Shang is almost the same. Jie had Meixi, and Zhou had Daji, both of whom were fox spirits. Although the storytellers were not clever and childish, they can just explain that what men like most is women, and what they fear most is also women. In the Bible, Eve swallowed Satan's apple, and sin also originated with women.</p>
<p>Of course, these statements are all "nonsense" from a male-centered society, and should be protested by revolutionary female comrades. However, in fact, although men rule the world, their purpose is nothing more than to please women or to hunt for more women, and even to hunt for women who cannot be pursued. Cleopatra brought Caesar the Great to his knees. A world-renowned hero was ultimately no match for a smile, which is really strange! Then, although women in the past did not fully occupy human fame and wealth like Wu Zetian, but they had substance without name, and it is not necessary to be too frustrated to explore and obtain the pearl.</p>
<p>It is true that women are turned into playthings for men, but that is vulgar women, just as vulgar men are destined to be subservient to the superior intellect. Mencius said that when the world is without Tao, the small is subservient to the large, and the weak is subservient to the strong. In fact, it is not enough. Originally, whether the world has Tao or not, the foolish are always subservient to the wise, which is undeniable. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also acknowledged this principle in his Doctrine of People's Rights. All human beings are like this, and women are no exception, except that women are enslaved at home and men are enslaved in society. However, the women who are generally intelligent can all play with their husbands on the palm of their hands, and make men unaware of it. This kind of magic power is beyond the reach of others. Ma Jiepu and Hengniang in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio are two stereotypes. Although Ma Jiepu's wife is fierce, she is not Hengniang's opponent. Only like Hengniang can she be gentle and overcome the strong, and manage the men to be docile.</p>
<p>Therefore, both the family and the country are like battlefields. Men and women are seemingly affectionate, but in essence they are fighting. Not only that, but women wage "civil wars" with women, and men wage "civil wars" with men. As Westerners say, "There is still life in the battlefield, and a murderous intent arises in the emotional battlefield," which is quite understanding. Just look at the secrets of the palace since the Han and Tang Dynasties, and the number of horizontal peach cases everywhere, which is really scary. Formal wars can be avoided, but only this kind of war cannot be avoided. No matter how reformed, it is always difficult to seek rationality. Mrs. Dorothy Parker of the United States wrote in her poem: "Women want monogamy, but men prefer novelty. Love is the sun and moon for women, and men have different colors. Women spend their lives with their husbands, and men get headaches after counting ten times down. All in all, if this is the case, what good things will there be in the world!" (Should be written in separate lines) This is just a woman's words, infatuated women and heartless men, in a word; as for men, why can't they do the opposite? How few heartless women are there in the world?</p>
<p>This is not important, but it may cause trouble. King You and Baosi were engaged in a war of nerves, but a beacon fire came to play with the lords, and the careers of both civil and military affairs were lost. What a "look that can bring down a city, a look again that can bring down a country." It is rare for a muddleheaded man to embrace the heart of "a beautiful woman is hard to find again," so the city and the country are really unreliable. Therefore, some people shouted, "The words of concubines and women must not be listened to." It is probably someone who has suffered. Don't say it's a bad thing, even a good thing can be messed up, because men often think that the person next to their pillow is the most trustworthy. While listening to Curtain Lecture, they also blow their own secrets. The Empress Dowager wanted to dismiss the corrupt Prince Qing and told the Grand Councilor Qu Ziju. However, Qu told his virtuous wife, and the wife revealed it to the British Minister's wife when she entertained foreign guests, and she instructed the minister in the Curtain. So the London Times published it in a special way, making the Empress Dowager want to investigate this anonymous person who leaked the secret. As a result, Grand Councilor Qu was dismissed from his post, and all plans were dashed. It only makes later generations sigh. Please think, how can the grand plan of reform be told to women, let alone women who want to show off in the Yi Suo? I have infinite regret for Secretary Tao, so I wrote the article on female favorites.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Going Upstairs <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>-- Liu An</p>
<p>Among the human race, which is still in the process of evolution, the activity that consumes the most energy is climbing stairs. For example, in terms of the calories needed for various exercises, in the same period of time, climbing a staircase requires 158 percent more calories than sawing wood, 110 percent more than running; it is even more strenuous than swimming, requiring 86 percent more calories.

<h3 id="e123">Salary Respect <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>School has already started, and we brothers who wipe blackboards and inhale chalk dust are about to start the show again with renewed vigor. Upon receiving the employment letter, the first thing to check is the number of teaching hours per week. Then, we must clearly see the amount of salary that we depend on for our livelihood in order to feel settled.</p>
<p>The price that teachers earn through their mental labor is called salary. Although this term has been used for a long time, it is somewhat frowned upon by senior teachers when discussed over tea and wine. In the era when private tutoring was prevalent, the respect that students paid to their tutors was called "study money," which is not significantly different in meaning from what is now called tuition. However, it was different for families who hired tutors in their private residences; study money was called either "house grain" or "bundle of dried meat." The former, plainly speaking, was just tuition calculated in rice; but with "house" attached to "grain," it clearly seemed like a very generous, refined, and respectful term, making both the giver and the receiver feel guiltless. The latter is based on the words of Confucius, "Of my own accord, I have never refused instruction to anyone who came to me with a bundle of dried meat." According to ancient annotations, a bundle of dried meat was "ten strips of dried meat." Stretching it means *ting*, bending it means *qu*. So ten strips of dried meat, in today's language, is about the same as "ten hams." Offering ten hams to Confucius was the most respectful thing to do, no wonder Confucius was willing to "patiently guide" them. With the advent of foreign currency, the bundle of dried meat was sometimes changed to "repair sheep." Great pains were taken to avoid using the word "foreign," because Confucius could not be bought with foreign money! Some even changed it to "repair gold," which already had a hint of money-grubbing. "Salary" had never been heard of.</p>
<p>In the early Republic, what was given to teachers in schools was called "repair gold"; if one held a concurrent position, the income from that position was called "salary." The employment letter clearly distinguished between the two, without mixing them up. Zhejiang was like that. A friend once got very angry because the repair gold on his employment letter was mistakenly written as salary; looking back now, he was too stubborn; since they're not asking you to buy ham, then buying some "firewood," which the family can use, is also acceptable!</p>
<p>Since the term "public education personnel" was established, the word "education" has been relegated to a subordinate position under the word "public." The price that civil servants receive for their monthly service is naturally called "salary," because they must be honest and self-disciplined, so in name, it seems they cannot eat ham every day! In this way, teachers, who in name could eat some ham to replenish their nutrition, also had their "repair gold" changed to "salary." Confucius, "the sage who is in tune with the times," I think if he were alive today, he would probably agree and say, "The bundle of dried meat is propriety; now it's changed to 'salary,' I follow the majority," right?</p>
<p>Some people say that teachers are hired, and their salaries should be different from the salaries of civil servants who are appointed. We could follow the example of the Qing Dynasty officials giving "charcoal respect" to poor scholars at the end of the year, and change it to "salary respect." I think this is a bit too pedantic. What do "colleagues" think?</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Tomb of Fragrant Concubine <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>Reading the 12th's newspaper, it stated that the round-domed tomb of Fragrant Concubine, located in the eastern suburbs of Kashi, southern Xinjiang, suddenly collapsed on August 2nd, and that this tomb was a famous historical site in southern Xinjiang, and will be from now on missing from view, etc. Those familiar with the story of Fragrant Concubine are numerous, but those who have not set foot in Xinjiang may not know the location of her burial. I will briefly describe it to inform the readers.</p>
<p>According to records, there is a Fragrant Concubine Temple located about four or five miles outside of Kashi, Xinjiang. The temple is square in shape with a round top, hollow and spacious. The tiles are green and blue in color, and the structure is very magnificent. There are no idols in the temple, only the tomb of Fragrant Concubine, which is the burial place of the concubine who was known for her beauty and integrity during the mid-Qing Dynasty (Qianlong era). The concubine was from a Uyghur noble family, the daughter of Ajimu Shaqun Hejia and the sister of Duke Tu. She was born in Hami. At the age of five, she moved with her father to Turpan. At the age of nine, she moved to Kashi. At the age of twenty, she married Da Hezhuomu. She had a unique fragrance on her body and unparalleled beauty. Her fame spread far and wide, eventually reaching the ears of the Qing Emperor Qianlong. He launched a military expedition, pacified southern Xinjiang, killed Da Hezhuomu, and captured the concubine, who was twenty-two years old at the time. The concubine was of strong character and integrity. Not only did she refuse to submit, but she also secretly hid sharp weapons, wanting to see her enemy and be satisfied. Although the Qing Emperor tried to appease her in many ways and built a "Uyghur Camp" in Beijing that was furnished just like Kashi, hoping to win her favor, it was to no avail for ten years. This reached the ears of the Empress Dowager, who, fearing that she would harm the Emperor, poisoned the concubine, or some say she was strangled. She died at the age of thirty-eight. Her sister-in-law was also captured and stayed with the concubine in Beijing. After the concubine's death, her brother died of grief and indignation. The sister-in-law then loaded the remains of the concubine and her brother onto camel carts, traveled through several large deserts, and transported them back to Kashi, where she built a tomb and temple. The loyal bones returned to their homeland after ten thousand miles. This is the Fragrant Concubine Temple mentioned above. The Uyghurs, grateful for the concubine's integrity, flocked to worship her in an endless stream. Over time, a bazaar gradually formed in front of the temple (bazaar in Uyghur). Even women seeking children or marriage, as well as those with marital discord, all went to pray, treating her as a deity. I recall that more than twenty years ago, Qianlong's mausoleum was excavated and then flooded. The bones of men and women were mixed and indistinguishable (because his many concubines were buried in the same mausoleum). Those who collected the bones had no choice but to hire an old undertaker who used to be in charge of examining corpses to sort and collect them, and then hastily bury them. If Fragrant Concubine had lost her integrity at the time, wouldn't she have been buried with the other concubines, and similarly been dug up by thieves, her bones exposed and flooded? How could there be today's tomb and temple, adding color to southern Xinjiang, and the Uyghurs offering incense and flowers to worship her as a deity? Thirty miles south of Guihua City in Suiyuan, there is the Green Tomb of Ming Concubine (i.e., the tomb of Wang Zhaojun of the Han Dynasty). Her beauty has been passed down for thousands of years. This tomb of Fragrant Concubine can be compared to it. However, Fragrant Concubine was able to return her bones to her hometown, while Ming Concubine is forever buried in a foreign land. This is the fortune of Fragrant Concubine.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Recent Poems from the Art Gallery <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Chu returned to his hometown via Shanghai, accompanied by Mr. Xueni to inquire,</p>
<p>and then invited Sanmu Kongwo Bai Jiao for a drink at the Art Gallery. At the</p>
<p>gathering, they talked about the Famous Figures of the Guangxu and Xuantong Eras, as well as the facts about the elders</p>
<p>such as Xiang Qi, Sanyuan, and Taiyi. Before parting, they agreed to meet on the night of the full moon at West Lake.</p>
<p>Returning east, my sleeves carry the water chestnut, temporarily leaving Qingxi to visit the crazy Chu. The trees in the courtyard still flow with January dreams, the wine vessels have been desolate for nearly half a year. It is difficult to resist the vulgarity of hiding in seclusion, and it is more than just regretting the loss of poetry. We look forward to meeting under the wind and dew tonight, to watch the tide and step on the moon to Qiantang.</p>
<p>Getting off the carriage, I rejoice at the feeling of the Art Gallery, and the post road is desolate, hiding my name. The fleeting time of illness makes spring and summer short, and the flavor of a cold official is rice, salt, and clear. The water of Songjiang is beautiful, and righteousness is initially purple, the sea market in autumn is high, and the moon gradually brightens. I love the deeds of the Guangxu and Xuantong predecessors, truly able to summarize a lifetime in a few words.</p>
<p>Lu Yanshao left behind a very beautiful Fortune Celebration Pear. I happened to read Mr. Feng Chaoran's short article about you, so I expanded on its meaning.</p>
<p>Building a secluded residence with thatch and bamboo, twenty acres of fragrant Hangzhou and one hundred acres of pear. I have already checked my hemp shoes and entered Shu in vain, and now I lie down in Wukang.</p>
<p>The main street is newly named Lu Family Rare, the branches are burdened with emerald green, not worried about poverty. The earth's energy naturally follows the noble person, as pure as ink and as flavorful as a person.</p>
