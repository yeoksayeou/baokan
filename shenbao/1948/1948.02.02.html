<h3>中美洽商漸趨具體　援華貨款月杪決定　剩餘物資按照合同移交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕美國援　貸款，漸具體化，據可靠方面消息，此項貸款可望於本月卄日前有具體結果，此爲最近數日來司徒雷登大使及傳涇　顧問與蔣主席及張　院長數度洽談後之車要收穫，其主要原因為張羣提出　項經濟方案後，已說明我國已有自助之策，而貝　詒氏在美之接洽，亦有相當功績，美援隨之而來，已屬　勢所趨，惟此項貸款並非美另行撥　援華，實即馬歇爾援華計劃中貸款之一部份，其數目或不較外問揣測者爲少。　〔中央社紐約一日電〕紐約時報採訪聯合國消息之記者韓密頓，今訪我代表蔣廷　。據云，將氏表示，渠信倘今後三四年內中國可每年獲得外援五億美元，中國政府必能建立和平及經濟秩序。蔣氏未表示中國將向美提出此項援助計劃，惟强調謂，內亂及通貨膨脹所引起之問題，　此間有連帶關係。蔣氏並論及日本，朝鮮問題，關於後者，蔣氏認爲蘇聯雖拒絕聯合國赴韓代表團進入北韓，該代表團仍應力求在南韓舉行選舉，並設立臨時政府。　〔中央社華盛頓卅一日合衆電〕美國國外淸理委會專員送致國會之報吿中稱：目前處理美國在遠東方面剩餘物資之主要工作，乃將按照中美，美菲躉售合同所應予中菲二國之物資移交該二國。中美菲代表目前之合作及工作情形極佳，擬定之各項計劃，常按有條不紊方法推進。日本，朝鮮則可在美國即將　表之標售淸册及餘存物資淸單中，繼續挑購各項物資。報告中並稱：中國在蘇必克灣接收美方船隻之工作，常有困難，此項工作可能至一九四九年始克完成，若美國海軍部不能供給中國所需之協助，或中國原定之計劃有所改變，則美國定將採取措施，取銷中美所定合同，將各項船隻運返美國，而將出售此項船隻之事，交由國會淸理委會處理。截止一九四七年十二月卅一日止，美國在太平洋中國區所標售剩餘物資之原値，爲四十億八千二百七十萬美元，其中百分之七十六（約合三億五千一百二十萬美元）業已出售。該報吿中並謂，美國在太平洋及中國區出售剩餘物資，共獲六億三千二百萬美元，約合原値百分之十八。</p>
<h3>省縣自治草案　國府小組會正審研中　余家菊主張先行部份實施</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕憲法實施後省縣自治之實施問題，頗爲一般人士所注意，前經若千人認爲，按照憲法之規定，省縣長之民選，應即展開，惟以若干地區在烽火綿延之中，若普遍展開省縣長民選，實爲事實上所不可能。又按照省縣自治通則草案第二章實施程序內所規定，實施縣自治之縣，應具備下列條件：　警衛辦理完善，　財政整理完竣，　戶籍登記辦理完竣，　地籍整理完成。省自治則應俟一省內所屬之縣有半數以上完成自治時，方可實施。記者就此項問題詢諸府委余家菊，余氏認爲：如完全遵守此項規定，則省縣自治實施之期，將延長時日甚久，故此點似可考慮修正。余氏之意見，認爲可更爲在以下各種情况下者，考　暫不實施省縣自治，　在戰爭情况下者，　要塞區域，　經濟　後地區，　人口稀少之省縣，以上數點均係就事實而言，惟此項草案現仍在國府委會小組審査曾硏討之中，目前尙未有結論。關於張羣院長所表示：省縣自治之實施，應在縮小省區以後，余氏稱二縮小省區問題，若千人均係基於過去軍閥割據之弊以及作戰制敵之組織民力不易，其實縮小省區實爲一學術上之意見，如即付諸實施，事實上必有若干困難，而前列之顧慮，在今亦不致重現。余氏認爲似可以若干幅員廣大之省份略專劃分，全部實施則可不必。余氏並認爲，在憲法實施後之今日，省縣自治旣不能立付實施，可以一過渡辦法以替代之，自此過渡辦法中，規定省縣政府之形式如何，則尚待研究。　〔本報南京一日電〕新任首都衛戍總司令孫連仲，一日晨正式到部就職，交接典禮於十時正開始，由前兼司令官張鎭親自主持，衛戍總部官佐五百餘人參加，京市長沈怡，警察廳長黃珍吾等均往觀禮。典禮開始時，首由張鎭致簡短介紹詞，謂孫連仲將軍爲名將，今出任首都衛戍總司令，相信今後定必能使首都衛戍工作更爲加强，張氏並追溯其就職以來首都治安情形，謂上海曾發生數次不幸事件，但南京幸迄無類似事件發生，渠對總部官佐在其任內所給予之協助，表示感謝。繼由孫連仲對所屬官佐訓話，提出三點：　衛戍部之職掌相當廣泛，希望做到在轄區內，人人均能安居樂業。　關於人事方面，決不輕易更動。　大家必須分層負責，以做到完善地步。孫氏並表示，現已担任首都衛戍工作，決本主席指示及張司令過去已奠立之基礎，努力做去。十時廿分訓話完畢，即由張鎭陪同至司令官辦公室視事，十時半張鎭與孫氏握手道別，孫親送至司令官辦公室門外，張即登車而去。</p>

<h3>全經委會討論原則通過　各國减低關稅事我政府尚未作決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕國際貿易採用進出口聯鎖制度辦法，全經會曾於一月卅日討論，原則通過，然政府現仍在研究考慮中。此項辦法雖可爭取外匯，但實行後勢必有利亦有弊。據悉，主管方面對此事之考慮，約爲兩方面：就其有利方面論：　在官定匯率與黑市脫節過遠之際，出口本受阻碍，同時政府因外匯來源减少，不得不縮小進口限額，勢將無法滿足國內生產界正當需要，而採行此制後可活潑進出口貿易。　聯鎖制係以進口商所獲盈利之一部補貼出口商，不須增加國庫負担。就其有弊方面論，亦有數端：　目前我國出口額遠不及進口額，採用此制後，出口雖可望增加，但其所增加之額，仍將用於進口，故進口亦必比例增加，進口商必爭向出口商購買聯鎖外匯，在供不應求情形下，黑市外匯將受其刺激。　進口額旣遠大於出口額，政府即放棄全部出口結匯所得仍不足以調劑進出口於平衡，徒使政府外匯來源减少，仍須負担進口所需大部外匯。　聯鎖制原有個別與綜合兩種，個別聯鎖適用於工業國家，製造者轍入原料，輸出成品，我國工業落後，難以仿辦。至綜合聯鎖制，雖可輸出猪鬃。蠶絲換取機器等，但以非出口木身所需，勢必准其轉售，聯鎖外匯將引起投機套匯之風。　我國出口商基礎素向薄弱，大多仍須經洋商之手，進出口聯鎖後，出口商未必能獲實益，徒爲洋商造牟利機會，以是政府在短期內恐不致採取此項制度。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕經部國際貿易司長張天澤，前赴日內瓦出席聯合國貿易就業會議第二次準備會，及减低關稅磋商會議，已於日前返國抵京。據渠語記者，日內瓦會議結果關於减低關稅已商定一日內瓦協定稅率，英·美·加·荷·比等國出席會議代表已呈請各該國政府批准，並已自本年一月起實行，中國則尙未批准。依照日內瓦協定稅率，各國關稅均將較前普遍减低，以地毯爲例，舊稅每方尺征收百分之六十，新稅則僅征收百分之四十，惟中國爲工業落後國家，主張仍行保護關稅，故是否實行此項新協定稅率，現尙不得而知。又關於外匯管制問題，在該會巾亦曾討論甚久，部份國家主張各國外匯開放不加管制，惟曾受戰禍痛苦國家，均主張管制外匯，美國主張開放外匯最力，曾提議各國管制外匯應至一九五〇年爲止，會中並未通過，惟決定至某一時限以後，各國可以協商放寬外匯管制辦法。</p>
<h3>調查華北請願團報告　三監委會畢返京　霍寶樹請提高官價外滙</h3>

<h3>論雷諾探險隊之來華</h3>
<p>— 劉咸</p>
<p>號稱「原子筆大王」之雷諸（Milton　Reynolds）氏一行，近由美來華，過滬赴京，宜稱將赴中國西部作高山探險，目的有五：　用雷達測定積石山（藏語作阿穆尼馬金）主峯之高度，　調査冰川，　研究地形，　探測黃河源，　攝取照片。經費預定爲十五萬五千美元，有特別裝備之飛機，歡迎我國科學家參加，設基地於成　云云。吾人於此，願抒所見，以促請我國有關科學當局之原注探開發，勘測自然，以增進人類之知識，擴大吾人之眼界，乃科學研究崇高之目的，世界科學先進國家，多優爲之，如蘇聯之於北極，美國之於南極，皆曾積極進行，成績斐然，貢獻良多。吾國前此以人力財力，俱感缺乏，致本國境內之高山大河，邊疆腹地，甚少探險，識者憾焉！故每逢外國科學團體來華探險，未嘗不表示歡迎，過去如美國自然博物館所組織之亞洲探險隊，瑞典之中亞遠征隊，以及法國之橫貫歐亞而抵北平之爬山汽車哈達——雪鐵龍探險隊等，皆其著例。</p>
<p>惟此次雷諾探險隊之來華，頗爲突兀，其組織·性質·目的·行程·時期·隊員等等，事前毫無所聞，中外報章，亦無記載，據傳現正與中央研究院當局洽商中·雷諾氏到南京後，始招待記者，發表談話，說明五項目的，介紹三五隊員，其無周詳凖備，可見一斑。要知探險工作，帶有危險性質，非事前　細計劃，妥為籌備，難免不臨時僨事，遭遇困難。不寗唯是，探險活動，係野外科學研究，尤非個人沽名釣譽之舉，必須事前確定目標，充分準備，專家計劃，方可策萬全。如作高山探測，至少須有氣象·地理·地質·動物·植物·以及測量·物理各科門之專家，共同合作。工作方面，一部分爲航測攝影，利用雷達測定山峯高度，一部分則爲地面探測，以確定高峯之位置，及附近山脈之走向，並繪製地圖。若調査冰川，研究地形，更須有冰川地質學專家（Glacial　Geolgist），與地形學專家（Seomorphologist）參加工作。今雷諾探險隊員中，除飛行師。攝影師機械師外，科學專家僅二三人，可見工作範團，隊員選配，事前並無通盤計劃，妥善打算，遽爾來華，作高山探險，吾人於該隊之眞正目的，殊有莫測高深之感。</p>
<p>復次，現代探險，非普通旅行可比，動關國防機密；此則主權所繫，更不容忽視。現時歐美各國，鮮有任令他國人民隨意深入腹地，作性質不明之探險工作者。今雷諾氏爲球尖鋼筆公司之主人，未聞有探險之經騐，領隊東來，一部分經費得自美國生活雜誌社之捐助，是該探險隊實具有濃厚之商業廣吿色彩，而非純粹之科學探險可知。照國際慣例，非科學牲質之探險，概不允許入境，更可不必贊助。若有軍事偵察性質之探險，尤須嚴加拒絕。</p>
<p>據日前芝加哥電傳，雷諾探險隊之另一重大使命，爲探測我國西部各大山脈中有無鈾（Ura-nium）礦之蘊藏，將用秘密儀器作有系統之探測，並估定其藏量。査鈾爲製造原子武器之主要原料，列强均在　力探測調査中，美蘇並早已下令禁止出口，以固國防。果所傳不虛，是雷諾探險隊之使命，固醉翁之意另有所在，希望我國防當局加意注視！</p>
<p>又科學探　隊之來中團　，往往以不遵守協定或我國法律，發生糾紛。如前述之美國自然博物館亞洲遠征隊，在安德魯（Chapman　Andrew）領隊之下，於達到目的地後，不遵中美合作協定，與當地政府發生衝突，馴致引起交涉：法國橫貫歐亞之爬山汽車探險隊，由哈德（Andri　Haardt）為總領隊，在吾國部分採中法合作辦法，由法人某軍佐領隊，蠻橫自用，不遵重我國主權，不顧我國隊員意見，大起糾紛；他如中瑞科學玫察團，由著名探險家斯文哈定（Sven　Hedi。）領導，結果亦不免人事磨擦，不歡而散。其尤不堪者，爲英人斯坦因（Auriel　Stein）在新疆考古，不遵守中國法令，引起我國學術文化界之一致反對，卒被吾國政府驅逐出境。凡所例證，遠者二十餘年，近者十餘年，凡經歷其事者，記憶猶新。吾人懲前毖後，於此次雷諾探險隊之來華，爲戰後外人來吾國探險之第一次，允宜採取嚴正之規定，本雙方互利互尊之原則，談判參加與合作，蓋吾國於氣象，地理，地質，動物，植物，攷古，高空測量等科目，現在均有優秀人才，堪任高山探險之工作，故對於外人，斷不可再如二十年前之敷衍趨附，結果徒　人唾駡譏笑，辱及國體，而有違吾人贊助科學探險之初衷。此則有望於吾國與雷諾探險隊折衝之有關科學當局，愼重將事，母蹈覆轍矣！</p>

<p>去年工程　為完成每年六百萬噸呑吐量的建港工程，新港從三十六年度起開始進行其三年計劃，第一年的工程，現在已經如期完成，主要工程包括六項：　防波堤工程，此中工作又分三項，1投石工程，原定第一年度投石十五萬噸，因爲交通困難，石料不繼，實際投石十萬零五千噸。2加置　灰塊工程，這一工程是以每塊重二十二噸的洋灰方塊，加在防波堤石塊之上，以防海水的冲盪，三十六年度共加九十塊。3加置洋灰圈工程，是與加置洋灰塊同樣性質的工作，每個重十三噸半，三十六年度共加置二十八個。　疏浚工程，預定計劃在三十六年度挖泥二百八十萬立方公尺，此項工作，實際上超過了預定計劃，共挖泥三百餘萬立方公尺，航道深度現在已經挖到大沽水平下四公尺，第一碼頭和第二碼頭則已深達六公尺。　船塢工程，已經完成了長一百公尺，寬十一點六公尺的船塢一所，塢底在大沽水平下三點五公尺，塢頂在大沽水平上四點七公尺。　發電廠及變電所，各完成一處，爲建廠建所，打了一千三百根十三尺到四十尺的木椿，八十八根九尺到十一尺的鋼板椿，完成了一千一百立公方洋灰基礎工程，這發電　現在擁有二千　發電機兩架、已開始供電。　完成三千平方公尺的碼頭堆棧三所。　築成六點二公里的鐵路。此外三十六年度的附帶工程，第一，修妥裝煤一架，每小時可以裝煤三百噸，第二，完成六百五十英尺水井三處，給水量共爲一百五十萬加侖，第三，打撈出的水中沉船計三十八艘。</p>
<p>本年計劃　關於新港三十七年度工程依新港工程局的工作計劃，重要工作計分七項：　防波堤工程，預備投石三十萬噸，將南防波堤現在的入海九點五公里處修至入海十公里半，北防波堤，也自入海七點九公里處修至入海十公里半，如此，南防波堤較整個計劃中十六公里點八的全長，尙差五點一公里，北防波堤較計劃中的全長十三公里點八，還差三公里點三。　挖泥工程，預定挖泥總量爲六百五十萬立方公尺，其中航道深度，要從目前的大沽水平下四公尺再加深三公尺半，並且把航道寬度從現在的五十公尺擴展到七十公尺，第一碼頭到主航道挖深到大沽水平下六公尺，第二碼頭到主航道挖深到八公尺，中間並且完成一處九公尺深的深水停泊地，此外，駁船碼頭挖深到三公尺。　碼頭工程，除了繼續第一第二兩碼頭的未完工程之外，並決定完成全長三百七十公尺的駁船碼頭，此外更加築長二百公尺深六公尺的修船碼頭一處。　修路工程，包括加修鐵路八公里，公路三萬七千平方公尺。　堆棧廠庫工程，包括第一碼頭加築三千平方公尺堆棧五所，增設二千　發電廠一所，木工廠，翻砂廠，鍛工廠，和船塢工塲各一處。　裝卸設備，將要增添一百五十噸起重力的游動起重機一架，二十五噸者兩架，另外要再完成每小時三百噸的裝煤機一架。　船舶方面決定購置自航式挖泥船一隻，强力破冰船一隻，而對於自航式挖泥船特別重視，因爲現在所有的固定式挖泥船，不便担任航道疏浚工作，三十六年度就因爲航道挖泥，而將通航的船閘封閉了四個月。</p>
<p>新港價值　當局對於塘沽新港的期望，成了國父實業計劃中北方大港的代替港，然而它是否足以荷起理想中的北方大港之任務，中外專家見仁見智，各有不同的看法，就未來的某一時期着眼，新港工程日人經營已有基礎，因而織續施工完成，以求利用，是一個比較經濟的計劃。但建港工程百年大計，新港的弱點正多，李書田氏說：建港工程應該用遠望鏡看，不能用顯微鏡看，李氏便是打的長久算盤，他指出新港的基本弱點，第一是新港距離深水綫太遠，幾乎達四十里，而靑河口距深水綫不過三數里，其次，新港是一灣死水，冬季的封凍問題也特別嚴重，而尤爲重要者是疏浚工作，將需要極大的人力財力來維持在海河無法澄清之前，這工作必然是一重担。然而戰亂不已，建國計劃如蝸牛舉步，則新港工程倘能如期完成，也不失爲一巨大功績了。</p>

<p>〔合眾社新德里卅一日電〕新德里警察當局偵查甘地被刺事件，在孟買捕獲十五人，並謂刺殺日地為在新德里附近作試探行動之陰謀一部份，被捕十五人被控與刺殺甘地之兇手戈有關。戈治係印度敎極端份子，渡那報紙編緝。據警方稱，戈治承認與其他五人陰謀殺刺甘地，一月廿日轟炸貝拉別擊案亦由渠等負責。戈治稱，炸彈案失敗後，渠等即決定個別刺殺甘地，警力咸信渠等由孟買附近最為反動之印度敎區波那來此，縝密擬定計劃，先刺殺甘地，然後刺殺尼赫魯等溫和派，再刺殺回敎領袖繆閘納等，以推翻尼赫魯之溫政權。警方稱，衆信陰謀爲印度秘密組織大乘敎會份子所組織，該組織企圖將印度拖往後轉，回復中古時代。渠等主張印度斯坦屬印度人，以流血或改變信仰加諸回教徒，以武力取消巴某斯坦，恢復印度敎之古代信仰。孟買警方咸信被捕之十五人，與刺殺有直接關係。據稱：渠等抽籤決定何人敎行刺殺甘　。衆稱戈治爲孟買之狂徒，渠在波那編一極端份子之報紙，反對甘地及國民大會。　〔法國新聞社孟買卅一日電〕各方對印度敎馬哈薩巴黨黨員企圖暗殺所有之大會黨重要份子早有所聞。據聞孟買警察局目前已査獲確證逮獲五人，嚴密之調査猶在繼續進行中。昨在當羣衆獲悉行刺甘地之兇手爲傾向馬哈薩巴黨之份子時，彼等之怒火皆針對孟買與波那之該黨組織而發，波那之暴徒攻擊與該黨右關之公共建築且擬縱火焚毁之，警察則　次企圖以細棒擊退彼等。馬哈薩巴黨主席之寓所及兇手弟兄之住所，皆被暴徒所毁。孟買發生槍擊及刀傷等意外事件，今日下午此間之情形仍極度緊張。</p>
<h3>孟買情勢已緩和　警局宣稱全城恢復常態　波那仍有縱火搶刦事件</h3>
<p>〔聯合社孟買一日電〕警察局今日宣稱甘地聖雄遇刺殞命後，此問發生暴動流血二十四小時，現己恢復常態，電車公共汽車停頓三十六小時，今晨黎明已照常開行。　　〔法國新聞社孟買卅一日電〕最近之非官方消息謂，此間在發生騷亂後至下午五時爲止，已有二十二人喪生，六十一人受傷。發生暴動之區域內仍在戒嚴　，下午六時當局對此間之騷亂已能控制，</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里卅一日電〕孟買北部羣衆與印度馬哈薩巴（印皮敎政治團體）之支持者發生大衝突，警察彈壓，開槍十次之多，結果商肆被普遍遭遇搶刧，受傷者五人。孟買中部有大批羣眾企圖焚燒印度義勇隊員之宿舍，當爲警察所制止。波那動亂未已縱火案與搶刦案層出不窮，警察迭事開搶，傷者二十餘人，內兩人係受彈傷，波那迤南一百六十公里處柯拉坡邦首邑柯拉坡城馬哈薩巴及印度義勇隊員之房屋被刦及被焚者不少，損失達數萬鎊。自夜十時起，已宣布三十六小時之封鎖，馬特拉斯省貝資華達共產黨人一羣與印度軍事組織RSS之團員起衝突，傷者及被捕者各若干名。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社亞姆里蔡卅一日電〕印度總理尼赫魯今日在錫克敎徒之聖城亞姆里蔡向民衆發表演說，抨擊好戰份子，據稱：「戰事與新事變將拙毁印度在國際間的聲譽，好戰份子　欲爭取政權，亦應以合法方式爲之」。</p>
<h3>改革國大黨　甘地生前計劃　主張爲農村民衆服務</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里一日電〕甘地被刺前歡小時所完成之改革國大黨計劃草案，現由國大黨某領袖保管中，其中之意見，或將由國大黨工作委員會之下屆會議提出討論，全文長共兩頁，內容甚爲急進而革命化。權威方面透露，甘也主張國大黨應為人民公樸所組織之國體，信仰非暴力之原則，甘地雖不反對現存國大黨繼構之解散，但在由人民公僕組成的新機構得以繼承其位時，現存國為印度之七十五萬座村落忠實服為專為人民服務之信徒，由彼等組成團體推舉領袖，再由各領袖互推全印並之國大黨領袖一人。甘地力主忠實爲人民服務之同志，必須穿着土布戒酒，尊重一切宗敎之神聖及平等，對階級血統性別無所歧視，更須以提高村民文化，改進農村衛生，爲農村服務為宗旨。</p>
<h3>印巴可能和解　自行解決喀什米爾之事</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓卅一日電〕印度大使館發言人稱，參加安理會喀什米爾案辯論之印代表團，不久可能撤回新德里，此舉實際上等於表示印度之自安理會之議程上撤回關於喀什米爾爭端之抗議，同時亦所以表示印度之願與巴基斯坦自行覓取解決。　〔聯合社喀拉基卅一日電〕巴基斯坦政府官吏今日參加印度敎徒之行列直至海濱，注視印度敎徒舉行之浸水禮，以示對甘地示敬。同時巴基斯坦全境戒備，以防甘地暗殺可能引起之暴動。</p>

<h3>西歐五國盟約草案　法外部在研究中　內容與鄧扣克盟約相近</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎州一日電〕據悉法國外交部已在研究英國所起草將由英法個別向荷比盧三國提出之同盟條約草案，其內容與英法在鄧扣克簽訂之盟約極相近似。料法國對此一草案，不致有重大異議。</p>
<p>下一行動將爲由法國政府對英國政府所擬之草案提出意見，然後草成最後草案，向荷比盧三國政府提出研究。倫敦觀察家相信在最後草案之內容決定以前，荷比盧三國當不致有皎前此正式歡迎英法建議時更進一步的表示。熟悉此事內幕之倫敎觀察家相信，英國所提之五國盟約草案，有一點與鄧扣克之盟約有重要之出入，英法盟約以實行互防，以防德國再侵略爲其主要性質，而五國盟約關於此點，當較英法盟約缺乏强調性。其理由蓋在西德之併入馬歇爾方案範圍以內，以及西德之可能於最後參加西歐聯盟，在五國盟約中不得不予鄭重計及故也。</p>

<h3>蘇聯新預算龐大　軍費達六百六十億盧布</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科卅一日電〕最高蘇維埃於今日在克里姆林宮舉行第四屆會議，史達林元帥親自蒞塲。，元帥穿灰色軍服，當步入會塲時，精神殊爲飽滿，全塲議員均熱烈鼓掌歡迎。外交部長莫洛托夫及政治局內閣要員亦均列席，財政部長施佛萊夫發表本年度預算案之演說時，述及「在明智的領袖史達林元帥領導之下，蘇維埃人民經向共產主義之途積極進展」之際，全塲掌聲雷動。施氏嗣報告蘇聯軍費支出，本年較去年減少廿五億盧布，計六百六十億盧布，佔總預算百分之十七。公共衛生及敎育費則較去年有激增，本年度全國小學生當達三千三百萬人，中學生七十二萬二千人，均已超過一九五〇年之預定目標，衛生研究工作費用，已較去年增加百分之七。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓卅一日電〕莫斯科宣佈之蘇聯新預算，似表示蘇聯在軍費方面已超過美國。但此問意見認爲數字之比較無大意義，因盧布與美元之關係，甚難確定也。如以五，三盧布對一美元計算，則蘇聯軍費達一百廿一億八千八百六十萬美元。杜魯門總統建議由七月三日起本年度國防費爲一百十億二千五百萬美元，較蘇聯約少二十億美元。蘇聯估計盈餘可達九十億美元。杜魯門估計美國盈餘達四億八千七百萬美元。</p>

<h3>北美報業聯合會版權所有</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>眞實的論據最後說服總統</p>
<p>對貿易協定最大的威脅，並非來自外國，亦非來自共和黨方面，亦非來自若干製造商或種植家，知來自羅斯福政府內部；以農業調節局前局長庇克（George　N.　Peek）為代表。</p>
<p>一九三四年三月，總統任命他做國外貿易顧問。假如羅斯福先生用大鐵鎚當面打我一記，那麼使我暈眩的程度也不會比這個任命來得更厲害。單就做人講，庇克和他人相處的關係，是最可親可喜的。他在見解方面很忠實，抱定之後決不放鬆。但是我相信他的經濟觀念是不健全的。假如把它們來代替我們貿易協定所依據的健全經濟政策，勢必造成最深刻的悲劇。他和他同道所作的努力，時而獲得總統的協助，結果，幾乎排擠掉我的整套國際經濟政策和實施計劃。在我，是想靠了這些政策和計劃推行到全世界去，從而改善經濟幸福與和平的。</p>
<p>庇克時常帶了整籃的統計材料到白宮去，總統支持他對報界的聲明。他給總統一個備忘錄，力促總統把管理全部國外貿易政策和談判的權力交給他。假如如此做去，他將把國務院以及商務，農業，財政各部對國外貿易任何方面的眞正發言權，剝奪殆盡。幸而我能够阻止這種發展。</p>
<p>繼而，庇克就去和外國談判物物交換協定—這種辦法，歐洲正在行使，而我們就希望經由根據平等待遇原則的貿易協定而最後加以消滅的。他的出發點，無疑是忠實的，因爲當時的確有美國的剩餘物資，必須在國外加以處置。但是他完全沒有看到此類物物交換協定，是和貿易協定不能同時並存的。</p>
<p>貿易協完法案以廣泛的政策和廣泛的貿易方法爲對象，並不是以個別的物物交易為對象。我們的貿易協定政策的一個基本要點——就是商業待遇平等以及反對各種各樣的歧視和優先　——勢將被庇克的物物交換建議公開加以破壞。我們的計劃，是想經由减少國外的歧視和優先權以及促進貿易待遇平等的辦法，廣泛地提供輸出上的便利，尤其是輸出這些剩餘過多的東西，像棉花，烟草，猪油，小麥，汽車之類。依我看來，在世界各地維持這種政策是極端重要的。</p>
<p>在一九四三年整個夏季中，國務院的同事和我曾費去許多時簡去反駁庇克的理諭。在一九三四年十一月和十二月中，庇克和德國談判一項物物交換協定，於是矛盾達到了頂峯。德國一方面公開延宕對美國已經到期的二十億元債務，因此對美國的債權人維持着最惡劣的信用，而另一方面它却裝着要和我們成立一個公平的貿易協定。同時，它又設法去撫慰別的國家，暫時償付它的債務以及貿易方面的欠款。</p>
<p>希特勒的經濟魔術家派了一個代表團到美國來，庇克和他們談判，護得了一項協議。道項協議，具有總國待人接物的一切標準特色，猶如希特勒和沙赫特握住了別國的咽喉强迫它們接受的一樣。我們應經由進出口銀行以棉花八十萬包售予德國，德國則以全部代價中的四分之一用美元付給進出口銀行。至於其餘的四分之三，則以德國通貨償付，外加利息百分之廿二·五·進出口銀行可以把這筆通貨打一折扣，售予採辦德國貨物的美國進口商，以便用以償付這些貨物。</p>
<p>當這筆交易正在進行談判的時候，我竭盡力之所能跟總統爭辯，表示反對。我覺得總統對於國外貿易政策的興趣，已經大不如前，猶如他在競選和受任總統之前所表現的。在他致力硏究國內改革之後，他已經極少時間去研究國際經濟關係了。從我和他的接觸中看來，我不相信他正在密切注意國外經濟關係這一方面。</p>
<p>十一月十九日，我從他那裏接到一個非正式通知，共中說</p>
<p>「猶如許多年中你和我曾經辦理過的大多數問題一樣，論據總是有兩方面的。在純粹的理論方面，你和我意見一致，但是有些時候，我們必須修改一項原則，以便應付一樁硬性而沒有辦法的事實！且看在過去六個月中大批的日本棉布湧到菲律賓去。　「我心裏想，假如你，和從極現實角度看待貿易問題的庇克，能够在某一晚上費去一二小時的時間，就最惠國條款這個問題商談一下，在許多方面一定是極有助益的。」</p>
<p>照一切實際的意義講，遺種辦法無異要我把庇克請來，事實上放棄我的計劃，讓他在經濟領導方面取我而代之。我澈底相信總統和庇克對這個極端重要問題的見解，是錯誤的。在待遇平等這一點上，決無妥協辦法。或者你獲得平等，不然你就獲得不平等。你不能使兩者同時行得通，容易協定法案爲貿易協定奠定了平等待遇的原則。假如這個原則被修正了，那麽總統所說起的「硬性而沒有辦法的事賞」，勢將成爲更硬性和更沒有辦法。</p>
<p>我的確請庇克來了。但是，猶如我早就完全料到的，我們就他所提出的建議而進行的談話，完全沒有結果。一九三四年十一月廿八日，我寫一封信到喬治亞州的溢泉去給總統，送給他有關商務政策的三個備忘錄。我說，「據我所知，政府者干部門對於此中所說明的見解，完全和諧一致，唯有我們的好友庇克是例外。報界方面，一般是支持我們的，猶如我在火車上向你說過的。」</p>
<p>幾天之後，我離開華盛頓到田納西州的那希維爾城去，預備在那裏發表一篇有關晨業和貿易協定的演說。當我在返歸華盛頓時，我的助手麥克勃雷特在浮吉尼亞州的夏洛丹斯維爾城和我會面，帶來副國務鄉費里普於十二月十三日所發出的一封緊急函件。這封信開頭就說：「在過去二天中，以一種出人意料的突兀姿態，發生了變化，這種變化，據我所知，對你一定是很難受的。」他把事實再叙述一番，說在十二月十二日庇克和總統進行會商，之後，白宮就通知國務院，聲稱總統已經核准了和德國商定的物物交換協定。費里普和白宮通電話，從總統那裏獲得了一個保護，就是說在我回來之前，暫不作最後的決定。</p>
<p>在我一回到國務院之後，我的同事和我立即把反對和德國進行物物父易的論據，搜集在一起，由我呈送給總統。我吿訴他我們的貿易協定計劃將遭受嚴重的危險。目前我們正在和巴西談判協定，現在已經接到巴西的抗議了。巴西也是一個棉花輸出國，它說假如我們和德國成立了這種　有優先權性質的協議，它將被迫採取同樣措施，並且延緩和我們簽訂協定。</p>
<p>我指出這種交易，等於補貼德國輸入美國的貨物。由於用打折扣的辦法把德國通貨售予採辦德國貨物的進口商　讓他們用以償付輸入的德國貨物，結果他們可以從德國以較低的價格獲得貨物，較從其他國家獲得同樣的貨物爲廉。</p>
<p>這筆交易，規定按照舊的金元匯率把馬克折台成美元，如此，無異推翻了美元的貶値，至少牽涉德國的一部份是這樣</p>
<p>我說我們的棉花輸出商事實上可能不能够因爲向德國出售貨物而獲得美元外匯。他們不致於被迫出售棉花以致蒙損失一點，並無保證。美國政府可能經由進出口銀行而蒙受其他損失。</p>
<p>我還說，物物交換辦法是以庇克的一種信念爲根據，就是他以爲我們除此以外別無辦法把棉花售予德國。實際上是適得其反。我覺得德國需要棉花如此之般，它至少要買五十萬包，而將設法　致美元外匯來償付它們的。</p>
<p>除了這一切論據的細則之外，還有一樁事實尤爲重要，那就是這筆交易是歧視性的，而不是平等待遇性質的。德國輸往美國的每一種貨物，因此獲得了一種特殊的利益，每一個向美國輸出這一類產物的國家，必然會提出抗議，可能採取報復措施。智利大使對我們說過，假如德國的肥料在我們市塲上事有優先待遇，猶如這個協定中所規定的，那麼智利將被迫把硝化物，到這裏來傾銷了。</p>
<p>我說：「這筆交易對美國人是極大的歧視，對于德國却是一筆極好的物物交換生意；美國收穫極少，而冒險極大……建議中的計劃，在激烈定對無特勒政權的美國大部份民衆中，幾乎一定會引起極端的憎恨。」</p>
<p>幸而總統看到了這些諭據的眞實性。他撤回了對庇克這筆交易的核准。這也就是庇克意圖和別國談判類似交易的終結。從那時候起，包含于貿易協定原則和計劃中的新建議，不斷地剝弱庇克的計劃，終於使它粉碎。我不斷向總統說明我們這個計劃的健全性，尤其是平等待遇的非常必要這一點。一九三五年二月十五日，我在致　統的一個備忘錄中說：「我國可以和其他國家採取舊辦法，把它的貿易活動僅限於極狹窄的範圍之內，祗做一些物物交換和兩邊買賣的交易，但是明白了在過去幾年中，我們的輸出增加了四億五千萬美元，而歐洲全體國家，運用了這種狹窄性物物交換協定和兩邊買賣條約由數以百計的方法和措施來增加　出，所獲也不過如此，明白了這一點，我們就不能這樣做。」</p>
<p>我向羅斯福先生指出，我們第一個步驟，就是要悄滅或减低過份的稅率，凡足以完全或者實際上消滅競爭的稅率，或者是實行了相當時期結果並沒有使國內生產量能够滿足國內總消費量百分之十至十五以上的稅率都在其內。同時，凡是適用于極無效能的商業或工業的稅率，或者對各色各樣的斯奇製品，奢侈品，半奢侈品，實質上和本國生產品不同的東西，或者用途上不同的商品所課的稅率，祗要不致於對美國產品引起嚴重的競爭，都應該消滅或者减低。</p>
<p>兩個月之後，庇克的辦事處被取消了。貿易協定得了救，而以後的結果充份地證實了我們反對庇克的思想，是確有根據的。</p>

<p>前晚混亂中受傷之舞女職工及警負等，經分送南洋，廣慈醫院急治，一部份略事句　後即吿離去，一部份傷勢較重者已於當晚移送警察議院，昨有舞客多人曾携帶鮮花及水英往南洋廣慈探視，結果得悉舞女業已離去，悵悵而返。</p>
<p>市長局長派員慰問受傷員警</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日舞女及職工搗毀社會局時，在塲維持秩序，嵩山警察分局長宋廷鈞及警員數十人皆吿受傷，吳市長昨特派交際科長前往慰問。社會局第四處長袁文彰及人事室主任沈星藩亦代表吳局長於昨農十一時赴警察醫院慰間受傷住院之摩托車隊分隊長盧渤浪，五一九二號魏連魁，飛行堡壘五九五三號馮若愚，機動車隊五〇五四號李慶，五二九三號劉雲廷及在家療養之嵩山分局第一股股長熊爲超。每人致送慰勞金一百萬元及糖菓等物。此外並擬致送獎金，數額尙未決定。其中熊股長因係內傷，袁處長特往吳局長私邸取贈雲南白藥。</p>
<p>搗毀社局禍首方主委主嚴懲</p>
<p>市黨部方主委爲舞廳職工及舞女請願搗毀社局事，發表談話謂：「社會局吳局長對禁舞一事，幾次晋京請示，其愛護舞業同人，委曲求全，有目共睹。今請願不出於正當行動，而公然搗毀機關，忤辱官吏，目無政府，無法無天，莫此爲甚。吾人確知上海近來發生之數次事件，均爲野心份子之預謀，是以得次行動，均有不明身份之份子參加，同濟之騷亂如是，社局之搗毁亦然，而口號標語，光怪離奇，極反動之能事，此決非一般爲解決生活有理智之舞廳職工及舞女所爲。此種埋藏上海之大批奸徒，害羣之馬，一日不去，則上海社會一日不安。深盼軍政當局從嚴處理，澈査禍首，繩以國法，處以極刑，使妖魔露形，打風絕跡，則市民幸甚。至於舞女轉業，本人當盡爲民衆服務之責，與當局共商善後」云。</p>
<p>宣司令發表談話決撲滅暴行惡風</p>
<p>上海四十八小時內接迎發生兩大驚人事件，一月廿九日由同濟學潮變質爲毆打吳市長之暴行，及卅一日請願舞女與舞廳職工三千餘人搗毁社會局，洽安當局深爲痛心。淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾一日對中央社記者稱：此種惡風，現爲開端之時，必須嚴厲予以撲滅，以儆效尤，過去兩事件之爲首者，決予嚴辦，其幕後主使人，尤需追查，絕不放過。宣氏對記者所詢搗毁社會局事件中被捕之舞業團體三負責人，作何處置答稱，被捕之舞廳業公會理事長孫洪元，舞廳職工會理事長庸宗傑，與理事相運源，刻由警局詳密偵訊中，赴社會局請願之羣衆中，勞資雙方皆有參加，結果發生搗毁之暴行，彼等爲勞資雙方之負責人，當然應該負責。然彼等開會時作何決議，赴社局原意何在，是否有搗毁社局之存心，以上各點爲判定彼等罪行輕重之重要關鍵云。</p>
<h3>舞廳不即刻禁絕　仍分爲兩期淘汰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳局長經畫夜勞頓，精神頗感疲乏，昨晚吿記表稱：中央方面對於此事之處置尙無指示到來。禁舞問題決仍本原定辦法分期淘汰，並不因昨日舞業之越軌行動而即刻禁絕。至社會局被毀後之損失究屬若干，目前尙無法估計，惟已將詳情呈報市政府核辦。</p>
<h3>金美虹之母　哭鬧公會　持本報作證代女兒呼屈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舞女代表之一金美虹，前晚被逮，暫押嵩山分局。其母昨曾往舞業公會哭鬧，並持本報刋出之照片對人稱：照片上她明明搖手制止別人搗毀，怎麼可以說她參加領導？聞金在偵訊時亦否認曾參預搗毀。大多數在押中之舞女昨竟日痛哭啜泣，均謂受逼參加，不料身羈囹圄，念及家屬生活無依，悔恨交集。</p>
<h3>刦後社局滿目瘡痍　屋角滿堆斷椅破桌職工含怨收拾殘餘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕被搗毁之社會局，昨雖値星期日，各部門人員仍到局辦公，從事艱鉅之「善後」工作。林森中路之正門大鐵門禁閉，往來行人對此被損之建築物，均駐足張望，投以關切之月光。局內各部門職員則在吳局長李副局長及各處科長督導下，帮同工役收拾破　凌亂之局面。被　衆衝入搗毁之各室，窗戶洞穿，暫以木板紙張等糊遮，以避冷風·各角落堆滿斷足殘缺之桌椅，或被撕碎丟擲之文件紙片。整理至晚，始稍有頭緒。但各辦公室桌椅用其短缺甚多，今日祗能因陋就簡，準備以進餐用之長桌等拚凑辦公。雜物用具得陸續添置補充。</p>
<p>各室之損失，除桌椅用具雜物外，第一處工商登記科之全市工商登記卡，被傾覆於地，差幸尙能收拾整理，無多大損失。但糧食科內之文卷簿册單據則全被撕毁，其中有實施全面配糧資料，配米名册，政府拋售食米賬册及有關糧食統計數生等重要文件。工作職員於滿地紙堆中，欲一一找尋整理，頗感煩惱，怨艾之餘，對搗毁者切齒痛恨。</p>
<h3>私人物件薪金　同告失踪</h3>
<p>各室之損失除公物外，尙有甚多職員之私人物件亦遭遺失。其中公敎人員實物配售設五聯單及薪金剛發下未久，同人多隨手置於抽屜中，或壓於　玻璃下，紛亂由皆吿失踪。李副局長因於會議室中出席勞資評斷會議，置放辦公室由之美國　子呢帽，鋼筆，及勞資評斷　發下之車金，亦遭損失。</p>
<p>該局昨日特通知各處科室，卅一日舞女職工搗毁時所有遺留各種證件如旗幟臂章等，請各同仁於即日一律檢送文書股，以憑彙案辦理。如有能認明姓氏面貌者，亦請一律報吿。</p>
<h3>黃首檢親來履勘</h3>
<p>地檢處首席檢察官黃亮，於昨晨十時左右親赴社會局察勘受損情形，由該局職員陪往被搗毁各室視察，並報吿常時情形。</p>
<h3>各界首長紛致慰問</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日舞業請願搗毁社會局事件發生後，昨日中央方面特派洪蘭友氏向吳局長慰問，本市各界首長如杜月笙·徐寄廎·吳紹澍·楊管北·陳保泰·曹俊等亦均先後至吳局長私邸紛致慰問。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕社會部谷部長，聞悉本市舞廳職工舞女搗毁社會局，至爲震怒，昨特由京來長途電話，向社會局吳局長慰問云。</p>
<h3>藉口請願實行暴動　舞業三團體社局令解散</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舞女及舞廳職工前因請願將於局搗毁後，吳局長以其行動越規，不法已極，決定下令解散上海市舞廳商業同然公會·舞廳業職業工會·及職業音樂師協會三體，着即停止活動，兩　警察局派警執行，並請從嚴究辦。解散訓令可於今日發出，除呈報吳市長及社會部谷部長外，並分令市商會總工會知照。訓令今文如下：「查該會藉口請願，率領會員於本年一月卅一日下聚衆前來木局實行暴動，搗毁公物，妨害公務，擾亂社會秩序，殊屬不　已極。依照非常時期人民國體組織法第十八條第一項第四款之規定，應予解散，另候派員整理。除兩請上海市警察局執行外，仰即　遵毋　，此令。」</p>
<h3>一紙清單　物質損失五十萬萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局被搗毁之損失，至今尙無法統計。除文件外，物質損失據佔計在五十億左右。毁壞器物初步登記，計為福特汽車二輛，拖爾卡車一輛，腳踏車七輛，扶手椅一九只，單人椅一一九只，雙人沙發三只，下班　面九只，電燈五九盞，電鐘四只，玻璃文具盤一只，熟水瓶二六只痰盂二六只，方　三只，皮椅二只，宗卷櫥三只，玻璃鏡架三只，茶杯一三五只，呌人鈴一三只，烟灰缸二〇只，檯布五條，玻璃果盤六只，墨水缸三一只，花瓶三只，花碗二只，綱窗帘六塊，檯燈一三只，電話機一八具，玻璃板七四塊，記事牌一八塊，花盆架二只，小檯三只，小　鐘一只，沙濾缸一只，印泥七四只，打印台五七只，算盤三五只，密達尺三六根，釘書機一六只，水盂五九只，硯台三九只，墨三九錠，大玻璃櫉一座，玻璃佈吿牌一槐，卡箱四只，佈吿牌二塊，索引箱二只，圓檯二只，磅秤一架，皮轉椅一只，　匙箱十只，衣架二只，雙人靠椅四只，長櫃四只，破沙發三只，吊電扇六架，方櫈七只，掛鐘二只，鋼板四塊，油印機三架，玻璃公文櫉四只，中文打字機五架，西文打字機二架，木椅一只，打字　七只，四人寫字檯三只，長　二只，封信口機一只，轉椅一〇只打洞機七只，木靠椅八只，窗帘鋼梗一根，鉛桶六只，茶几八只，單人沙發一〇只，雙人寫字　二二只，單人寫字　三七只，鐵公文櫉一只，十二抽屜公文櫥一只，筆架一五只，墨盒六只，四門大木櫉二只，火灰缸二只，面盆三只，茶盤四只，黑板一塊，小寫字　一只，屛風五塊，衣櫉一只。</p>
<p>以上尙祇全部被毀器物三分之二，且玻璃門窗等皆不在內。以被毀門窗玻璃論，即有數百塊。</p>
<h3>東長治路火燒　燬一商舖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長洽路九三八至九四○號裕昌鍋磁號三層樓，昨日下午七時四十五分許，不戒於火，　穿屋頂，後經消防處　皮帶車馳往灌救，約一小時許始熄，計焚去三樓房屋一間，損失殊鉅，火首經　　警帶入提　橋警分局詢問起火原因。</p>
<h3>浦江中貨船失慎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕停泊於黃浦江永安紗廠附近之雲和木　馬達貨船，昨晚七時發生火警，經江海關護寗消防艇趕往施救，二小時後始吿撲滅，全船設備損毁無遺。</p>
<h3>流亡來滬學生　宣傳共匪暴行</h3>
<p>上海流亡學生實傳大隊，爲自匪區流亡來滬之大中學生所組織，彼等均曾身歷其境，不堪共匪蹂躪之痛苦，將目睹共匪暴行事實，宣掦於社會，提高後方人士之警惕。該大隊隊員九十餘人，昨晨首次出發本市各區舉行宣傳，在各戲院舞廳宣傳時，聲淚俱下，聽衆莫不感動，並一致高呼剿滅共匪之口號，情緒至爲緊張。</p>
<p>黨部宣傳大隊冒雨化裝宣傳</p>
<p>國民黨上海特別市黨部官傳工作大隊，自成立以來，對戡亂建國宣傳工作，積極開展，頗爲緊張。該大隊昨晨在育才中學舉行第二次隊員大會，到隊員百餘人，談處長主席，除檢討各區隊工作槪况外，並對今後工作進行，有詳盡之研討。會後該大隊全體隊員，復冒雨分赴龍華，漕河涇，及南市等處，舉行化裝宣傳，觀衆達千餘人，情緒頗爲熱烈。</p>
<p>瑟縮在小蓆棚中　幾十萬窮苦同胞正和死亡捕　着　僻靜的弄口不時發現一包包的死孩</p>
<p>上海住在棚戶中的窮苦同胞們，居住的地區，大體上可分爲滬南·滬西·滬北·滬東·浦東五區。</p>
<p>打開上海的地岡來看，滬南方面從大東門向南開始，從小九華街後面的篾竹街筷竹弄，便進入棚戶區了。向南到蓬萊區公所王家碼頭，西南的南倉街，張家弄，靑龍橋街，公館街，多稼路等地都是。再向南，沿着陸家浜路兩側，由外馬路經過裏馬路，草對　，池河頭，海潮路，跨龍路，直到普育東西兩路，這中問都是又髒又擠的棚戶，再從滬閔南柘路向西北到　　路，南邊尙不到　質人路，西到製造局路，這一個小方塊內，也住了很多在汚泥潭中掙扎着的人們。</p>
<p>壞到不可想像</p>
<p>再向西進入嵩山區，北起斜徐路，南面也是直到郊野而還不到　眞人路，在這一塊內除了東北和中間不大多而外，其餘都是密集的，以魯班路餘　里，局門路垣宋村，斜土路第八十三弄，第二七五弄，斜橋路二四五號旁弄等地最多。</p>
<p>在盧家灣區內，北達也是以斜徐路爲界，南也是一樣，向西過了打浦路便不甚集中了，只有到日暉路斜土路口的平陰橋四周，才又稍微比校密一點，以魯班路祥大里，斜徐路定香禪寺兩側，斜土路，打浦路等最多。在魯班路斜徐路口的棚戶和魯班路麗園路口的棚戶，可以說是上海情形最壞的棚戶，簡直壞到不可想像，再西邊的常熟區內棚戶比較稀少。</p>
<p>滬南棚戶的分佈，像一把橫放着的小洋刀，東西長，南北短，北邊大體以徐家匯路的河浜爲界，南邊直到曠野，大半拉軍子做小工，大約共有一萬五千戶，八萬多人。</p>
<p>又髒又亂又窮</p>
<p>再向西只有沿着徐家匯路的河浜上，有一些零星的棚戶，過了徐家匯，由徐鎭路向西在和慈佑路快會合的地方，呌做平民村，這裏棚戶很多。再向西然後轉向東北，沿着虹橋的兩旁一直到虹橋路的電台旁，都是草棚子，由番禺路向北從上海西站沿着長　路到江蘇路，在中山公園的周圍，如西新街，蘇家角，南北豬毛廠，盧薛宅，姚家角，孫家宅等地也都是他們匯集的所在。</p>
<p>向東北進入江舞區，江　區是個棚戶非常集中的區域。自膠州路以西全是中小工廠和棚戶交錯的地方，南邊如梵皇渡西側的太平里，北側的金家巷，康定路的南姚，延平路的康家橋。北邊從餘姚路向東，差不多每個弄堂裏面都是草棚子。面積大人口多的如北姚，六八一弄，六四一弄，六〇七弄，五〇一弄，四八八弄，四八七弄，四六八弄，四六七弄，共和里等。南通康定降，梵王渡路，北通長壽路，安遠路，面積很大，又髒，又亂，又窮。</p>
<p>密集閘北方面</p>
<p>普陀區較少，除了安遠路六二四弄，和西康路底的藥水弄，草鞋浜，集中的草棚子外，其餘都很零散。另外一些平民瓦房的住戶，雖然比草棚十要好些，不過也都是生活在水平錢以下的，如長壽路的興隆坊，梅芳里，南北櫻華里，東京路的東京里等是。滬西區的棚戶，大槪也有一萬五千戶。</p>
<p>在閘北方面，也是很密集的，一般稱之爲浜北。這塊棚戶區的地面很大，北面到郊野的靑雲路，西面到滬太長途汽車路一帶，南到鐵路，東到止園路，量爲集中。在中興路，永興路，虬江路，太陽廟路，交通路，京江路，大統路一帶，簡直我不到一座小洋房，甚至通瓦平房都很稀少，地也廣，人也密，在鐵路南邊的新疆路，共和路一帶也有不少。這裏合計大槪將近八千戶約有五萬人。</p>
<p>在北四川路區內，棚戶不太多，然都集中在香烟橋一帶。北到全家庵路。西到其美路，溧陽路。南到天　路。東到河浜。在這個區域裏面全是。從任何一個弄堂進去都可以見到。另外由其美路朝北，在其美路的西側以及其美路橋附近，也有不少。</p>
<p>提籃橋區特多</p>
<p>由香烟橋過去，便是提籃橋區的棚戶。這裏也是十分集中的。西邊到河浜，東北以沙虹路爲界，東南以岳州路梧州路爲界。在這個三角形的地區內，舉凡沙虹路，虹鎭街，臨平路，物華路，庫倫路，通州路，天寳路，張家巷路，海拉爾路，如　路，高陽路等路的弄內亦一概都是道區大家都擠在一塊，而在楡林區和楊樹浦區，則是一塊一塊分散開來的。由周家嘴路向東，在要和塘山路會合的地方，這裏有幾小塊，在遼陽路五三六號旁弄內，這是一大塊。過了昆明路再南又是一大塊。再南在霍山路通北路口有一塊。在霍山路向西，還不到荆州路，又是一大塊，再一直南下，福祿路的兩側，龍江路七五弄，一六三弄對面，小木橋，齊齊哈爾路中紡一廠前面，中紡十六廠對面及右側，蘭州路檢林路口，及齊齊哈爾路長陽路，昆明路口，高郞橋北等地，每地都在三四百戶以上。</p>
<p>這一帶工廠碼頭很多，所以棚戶也特別多，總共約有二萬戶十餘萬人。</p>
<p>他們的無辜的</p>
<p>從楊樹浦過江，沿浦東向西，兩旁只有一點零星的棚戶。如馬橋浜路，洋涇港，賈家橋，民生路口，乍浦路，姚家宅等地，有的很壞，有的尙可，戶數並不太多。到楊家宅轉入向南的浦東南路，在小石橋和普善山莊附近有百餘戶。從警局路向東南，東到浦東南路，西到黃浦江邊的碼頭堆棧，南到謝家宅，浦東電氣公司。</p>
<p>在這個區域內，除了陸家波，謝家宅兩個缺口外，其餘是非常密集的。如浦東南路靈修小學附近，楊家波，俞家廟，洋涇中學前後，老白渡南街，協昌里，榮昌路，東昌路，六九弄，一七〇弄，一八八弄，三一六弄，二二八弄，五五一弄，爛泥渡，北獲塘路等處，共約六千戶，三萬多人。以上是上海棚戶分佈的大槪情形。</p>
<p>當此天寒地凍的時候，這幾十萬人，却正戰抖在小　棚裏和死亡搏鬥。假如到一些僻靜的弄堂口轉一下，你便會發現一包一包的死小孩，或凍僵的老人，他們是無辜的，然而這正是他們的命運和歸宿，筆者謹把調査所得，寫將出來，提供主辦救濟常局以及慈善機關參考。同時這些材料，上海兒童福利促進會已搜集來作爲辦理兒童福利站的根據了。</p>
<h3>嚴重社會問題女監也患人滿　余愛珍手工做得很好郁香嚴脾氣有點傲慢</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕參觀過女監之後，所得的印象，是整潔而有秩序。</p>
<p>女監位於提籃橋上海監獄的一角，是一座四層樓的洋房，地方不大，可是裏面容納女犯二百四十餘人，顯得異常擁擠。原來法院方面分配　房的初意，以爲女犯不會太多，不料在兵荒馬亂的時候，女人犯罪的也漸漸的多起來了。據說　地院看守所合計已連千餘名女犯，將來判決犯陸續住女監裏移送，已有無法容納之苦。</p>
<p>進去參觀的時候，每一個女犯正在埋頭編結絨綫衫，這是該監裏最大的生產事業之一。　世　的妻子佘愛珍，李士　的妻子葉吉卿，都在靜靜的做活。據李梅魂課長說，余愛珍的手工做得很好，性情也柔順，葉吉卿做的比較差些，至於兩路局材料處貪汚案中女主角郁香　，則脾氣不大好，顯得有點傲慢，對於做工也不感興趣。除了編結絨綫之外·其他工作有綫級，做鞋，做西裝童裝，刺繡，洗濯，做牙刷，粉撲，手套，糊火柴盒等。</p>
<p>大都貪喫懶做　施以適當敎育</p>
<p>去年十二月純益金一千五百餘萬元，做工的人有賞金，依其工作動惰優劣分爲四等，提出所得百分之二十五，百分之二十，百分之十五，和百分之十。據林曉明課長說，這此女犯在家庭裏大都是懶惰異常，不會　　，入獄以後經過敎導，現在只有四個女犯能做細質的衣服，可見她們平常好喫　動之一斑了。除了做工之外，每日施以敎育，依智職程度深淺分爲八班，課程有國語，算術，常識，音樂。智識程度較高的則命其做日記，以覘其思想品行如何。</p>
<p>八個天真嬰孩　同過　　生涯</p>
<p>對於精神的感化，駭　亦特別注意。出慕爾堂婦女佈道團朱小姐，天主敎潘姆姆，基督敎李小姐，曁救世軍輪流宜講　經，希望以基督的敎義來感化這些女犯，將來出獄以後做一個善良的人。</p>
<p>有許多女犯入　之前已經懷孕，在女監裏生產，現在女監裏已有八個小寳寳，另　乳媽撫　，最大的嬰兒不足一歲，最小的僅有兩月，這些小天使們看到人張開小嘴嘻笑，不知道他們的母親正過着鐵窗生活。兒童福利促進會前次來參觀，看見這些人　的嬰兒可憐，送去牛乳五箱，魚肝油一大瓶。</p>
<p>為了生活　　不畏法</p>
<p>犯人每星期由家屬送菜一次，兩星期接見家屬一次，犯罪種類以烟毒居第一位。據李課長說，在這些烟毒犯接見家屬時，從他們的談話的語氣中，可以窺知她們雖然坐監，但是家屬仍然做着販賣運輸烟毒的勾當，並不因爲她們吃官司而有所戒懼。這的確是一個嚴重的社會問題，爲了生活，許多人在挺而走險，看到社會上犯罪的人一天天增加，我們懷疑法律與監獄究竟有多少力量了。</p>

<h3>靈糧堂房屋糾紛　社局前福利處長率衆驅逐住戶　敎友憤慨紛向各方呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市虹口溧陽路天同路口靈糧堂曁附設靈糧小學及該堂趙世光牧師所居之房屋，突於上月廿六日晨，被自稱爲凱納房屋經租處祭殿榮者，率領十餘人，强行佔住。並携帶　篋被舖等件，留宿不法，將會客室敎窒等一一强行改爲「辦公室」及「職員宿舍」，而將趙牧師之公私物件，抛擲門外。次日，靈糧小學舉行休業禮，彼等即以白漆在牆上塗寫「房屋收回自用」，「此處房屋已經牧回」等字樣。同時將自來水管切斷，致使數十人發生飮料恐慌，常話機亦被破壞。又次日復侵入三樓女職員宿苦加以佔據，該室正有一下姓女敎員臥床患病，彼等置之不顧，趙牧師有岳母　老病篤，受此驚恐，病勢趨危。而堂內所居者，皆敎會老弱婦女，經此擾嚷，　哀哭焦慮，狀殊可憐，雖經趙牧師與彼等交涉，並報吿警局，均無結果。該堂敎友　此莫不憤慨異常，紛向各方呼籲。昨日為做禮拜日，趙牧師僅能在露天向信徒講道。</p>

<h3>軍工路庇寒所繼續收容難民</h3>

<h3>新疆問題　卅年間影事與今後展望　本報特約記者</h3>
<p>— 馬次伯</p>
<p>新疆問題應該有一個整體的看法，一切問題的發端，都有互爲因果的關係，欲求澈底解決，不能支離破碎的從局部着手，必須顧全大勢之趨向，作整個改造，才能收到實效。根據和平統一民主團結的精神寫成的新疆施政　　，將會永遠得到新疆人民的擁護，他是解決整個新疆問題的一部法典。張治　將　在新疆大刀關斧的推行他的新政，他吐出諾　，要在新疆實行總理真正的民族主義，使國內民族一律平等。自道個新政實施以後，漢人在新疆的地位，將由統治者身分一降而爲平民，只能以一個普通民族的姿態，出現於新疆的社會，這對富有優越感的大漢族思想，是一個打擊，也是一個諷刺，因爲向來新疆的政權，都　在漢族人手裏，上自邊防督辦省長，下至縣政府三等押役，都是滿族人一手包辦。他們對待新疆土　同胞的手段，有句口頭禪，「三句好話不如一馬棒」，意思就是說：新疆的人民，只有　打的自由」沒有說話的自由。這種壓迫的政洽傳統，造成新疆無數次的變亂。還要說變亂是新疆人民的嗜好，有三十年一小反，六十年一大反的公式。統治階級永不　認自己　錯，造一次反，來一次征服，美其名曰「弔民伐罪」。</p>
<p>抱定民主態度　寬大沉着應付</p>
<p>張治由將軍不忍心讓這種歷史循環的罪惡，繼續演繹下去，決心創造歷史的新頁，開闢一條政治的新路。新疆就這樣的乾坤旋轉，頑石翻身了。大批的漢族行政幹部被淘汰，盡量引用土著民族的優秀人才，參加行政工作，張將軍對突厥語系的各族同胞，真個是恩惠備至，優禮　加，他們要求什麼，就批准什麼。例如减輕人民的負擔，頒佈免稅命令，釋放歷年所羈押的政治犯，批准發還前督辦公署沒收的人民財產等。重申保障人民身體自由的明令，通令禁止漢維人民通婚，撤消醫務處，解散貿易公司，縮編國軍，調整各行政專員的人事，民選縣長等等，無一不是應人民的要求，一板一眼的在推行民主政治。但是新疆四百萬同胞，心理上只有兩條出路，不是打算做統治階級，便是準備做被統治階級，除此以外，再沒有第二個政治的習慣。一旦出現了一個有超時代精神的民主政府，這使毫無民主經騐的新疆同胞，在心理上激起了很大的矛盾，似乎是完全誤解了民主精神的真實意義。少數自稱爲進步份子的維族同胞，在伊寗方面支持之下，組成了反國家，反國軍，反漢人的集團，在各地囂張起來，首先於卅五年七月五日，在南極殺害航空員金學勤，而兇手及嫌疑犯，在審訊的時候又被　　衆刧持而去，使法律的尊嚴也受到威脅。同時，又將嫁與漢族的婦女，拉入禮拜寺迫其改嫁，使迪化市面發生騷擾，他們認以親漢派的民族敗類，常常被羣衆毆辱，接着省府派往阿山區監選的小組組長，哈族優秀份子涂禹則，在中途即被殺害，和平後自蘇聯歸國的難民，在塔城大批的遭受屠殺與汚辱，伊寗的交通也時斷時續，軍隊不聽改編，行政不歸統轄，而迪化的暴烈份子氣燄仍高漲無已，曾一度包圍公路局，水利局，衛生處，省府會議，提出了四十八條無理要求，而造成二二五的流血事件。省參議會破裂以後，又有北塔山事件，吐魯番變亂相繼發生，以至阿哈麥提江副主席的不辭而去，這一連串的不幸事件，張　中將軍始終採取寬大，和平民主的態度，希望大事化小，小事化無，今天　阿副主席還在書信往還，希望他早日歸來，再作商量。凡是精神脆弱的人，都受不了這種政治的壓迫，而感到和平的危機，以至懷疑到張治　將軍政策的正確性。</p>
<p>新疆的和平，能維持多少時候，誰也不敢保證，但多一天總比少一天好，一般關切新疆問題而不十分明瞭新疆情形的人士，當然會疑惑現行的政策，認爲張治中將軍寬大民主的作風，實足以增長反國家反漢人者的氣燄，似乎軟弱無力。其實新疆有反國家反漢人的思想與言論，一方面是歷史的遺產，一方面是外力的引誘，不是自和平民主的政治下產生的，我們不能因此認爲和平就算絕望，這正是我們努力爭取和平的目標。同時，新疆的環境與內地不同，雖然沒有黨派的紛爭，但受一種看不見的力量直接控制，情形相當複雜，我們要認淸支特新疆問題的力源，不在新疆，廣大的新疆各族同胞是我們爭取與同情的對象，不是鬥爭的對象，所以寬大的和平民主政策，足以增長四百萬人民內向的作用，加強和平的安定力，造成我們政治上的優勢。所以張治中將軍和平民主寬大忍耐的政治作風，不是向伊寗方面示弱，而是討好新疆的四百萬同胞為國家收入心。</p>
<p>最有利的局勢　和平就是把握</p>
<p>新疆對我們最有利的局勢是和平。多一天和平，多一分準備，多一分凖備，就多一分把握，今年的情形就比去年好得多，假若再維持一年，明年當然比今年更爲樂觀了。</p>
<p>凡事作一時打算，與作百年打算，根本不能同日而語。我們讀到馬關條約商談的筆錄，李合肥相國在日本帝國主義的威脅之下，在滿　貴族腐敗王公的牽掣之下，在全國人民的咀咒反對之下，他審時度勢，毅然決然的簽定了那喪權處國的不平等條約，退而作改革進步，力謀復興的準備，今天我們才知道李相國眼光的遠大，胸被的廣闊，氣魄的雄渾，足够當得起是歷史不朽的人物。此次伊寗事件的和平解決，與馬關條約的性質，實在不可同日而語，因爲馬關條約是國恥史上最羞辱的一頁，伊寗事件的解決，不但搪塞了一個嚴重的外交攻勢，而且解決了內部的民族糾紛。是中國政治建設的一個重要工作，但談判中所遭受的困難，比馬關條約不過少一刺客而已。在忍辱負重的觀點上君來，李合肥與張朝縣，實在沒有什麼分別。</p>
<p>新疆問題雖不能因和平商談的成功，而全部澈底解決，但我們國家自和平談判以後，才算正式顧問新疆領土的主權，這是事實。一年多來，靠張治中將軍一人的運　折衝，有此初步安定的局面，今後欲謀長治久安，必須要有實際表現，開展各項建設，這不是新疆本身的力量所能做到，人力物力都須要國家各部門的協助，只要國家肯用錢，新疆的前途就有希望。李合肥所以不能復興中國，是他的理想與計劃，不能得到宮庭的支持與同僚的合作，乃至抑鬱莫申，我們希望新疆的前途不要踏上這個覆轍。</p>
<p>伊　力量微薄　螳臂決難當車</p>
<p>阿哈麥提江自迪化出走，並未引起任何一個新疆人的注意，這證明他在新疆的政治上已經失去舉足輕重的作用，一年來，把所有的政治資本都消耗完了，事實上並無多大成就，他的　衆瓦解了，他操縱的人民暴動失敗了，他想控制省參議會，假借民意來淸算漢人政權的計劃也成了泡影，最後，他只好像一頁鴻毛似的悄悄地飄回伊寗，這是他政治的末路。說他離開迪化對新疆的時局有什麼影響，我們實在看不出來，因爲他在迪化主持省政的時候，伊塔阿三區照樣的保特特殊化，他離開迪化以後也不過如此。說他回去發動戰爭罷，事實並不簡單，伊寗如果要發動戰爭，就祗有國際戰，否則伊寗小小的力量，絕不足以螳臂當車，因爲現在我們新疆的士氣民氣，非一年前可比，大家對於應付時局，似乎都胸有成竹了。至於是不是在此時有人來新疆發動國際性的戰爭，從各方面觀察，時候還嫌過早。只有在第三次世界大戰爆發的前夕，才有這種顧慮。所以我對新疆問題的看法，不必奢望以和平方式收復伊寗，縱然阿哈麥提江肯回頭，但也不能代表伊寗的歸附祖國，伊塔阿三區的特殊化問題，只有留待整個世界問題澄淸以後再看分曉。</p>
<p>任何恐怖政策　不合人民需要</p>
<p>阿哈麥提江飛回伊寗以後，迪化有許多謠傳，有的說他積極備戰，徵調壯丁，有的說他意志消沉，沒有什麽活動，有的說他行動受限制，失掉充分的自由。更有一種傳說，東北的共匪已有一部運到伊寗。關於阿哈麥提江的情形如何，我們且擱在一邊。但關於中共滲入伊寗的事，確有闢謠的必要。中國共匪雖然是一羣赤色漢奸，無孔不入，但他活動的範圍也受主人的限制，新疆是國際共產黨直接控制的區域，絕沒有中共活動的餘地。盛世才時代，中共派了大批幹部到新疆，但只能以個人的資格協助新疆政府，推行六大政策，絕不能在新疆發展中共的組織，不是中共不願在新疆活動，而是他的主人不許可活動。新疆是一個落伍的封建社會，伊斯蘭敎最多的地方。一切問題離不開宗敎，民族，政治，政治策動反國家，民族策動反漢人，宗敎趨向突厥伊斯蘭主義，東土爾其斯坦人民共和國的號召，係帶有宗敎民族政治三位一體的作用。由共雖然是反國家，但他總脫不了漢人的皮子，假若今天利用由共帮助伊寗，是以新漢人趕走老漢人，在新疆人民看來，老漢人雖然討厭，尚有留戀之處，新漢人帶來恐怖政策，盛世才股鑒不遠，實在不合新疆人民的需要，事實上決不可能。謠言終究是謠言，這種謠言或許是某方有意的製造，順便加以說明。</p>
<p>民選主席決定　政局自趨開朗</p>
<p>目前新疆的重要工作，在提高行政效率，加强各種建設，爭取和平的機會，把七區的政治弄上軌道，是爲上策。至於新疆政局的開朗，還要看未來的民選主席，麥斯武德先生受伊　的反對，是不是想得全疆人民的擁護，還得要加以測驗，完全要君他爲政這一段時間的成績如何。其他可能競賽的人，漢族方面，或者新疆省黨部的主任委員陳希豪先生會參加。陳先生在新疆多年，對於新疆問題的癥結及其困難，都能充分瞭解，我們相信陳先生的意思，絕不是僅僅想做新疆的主席。至於回族與哈薩克同胞似乎沒有這種準備，塔塔爾方面有鮑爾漢先生，是新疆唯一的一個學者，雖然不習慣政治生活，但除此以外，更無適當的人選了，還有伊敏與艾沙先生，頗有朝氣，只要不忘記新疆有十四個民族，而能爲十四個民族謀幸福，也無妨試試看。假　讓　疆四百萬人民自由選舉，我們相信大家會一致的擁護張治中將軍，因爲人民已經感覺只有張將軍才會有力地幫助新疆人民謀取幸福。（全文續完）</p>
<h3>全國司法行政　檢討會議決定　設立累犯監獄肅清龍頭積弊</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州一日電〕司法行政部以邇來各地監獄，時有鬧監情事發生，究其原因，實由於少數品性惡劣囚犯，雖身　囹圄，依然怙惡不悛，在監內以龍頭自居，欺侮新犯，惹是生非，領導起鬨，實有失監獄羈押人犯冀其悔過自新之本旨。經全國司法行政檢討會議決定，設立累犯監獄，以肅清龍頭積弊，每一省區　置一所，將全省監獄中所有累犯及惡性人犯，概移該　執行，監內　加　別，分房監禁。頃悉：此間蘇高院近已接獲是項通令，決指定鎭江監獄於本年度添建獨居監房，收容江蘇全省監內累犯，於未落成前，由各監　將所押累犯先行分別監禁。</p>
<h3>黃田港口　長江下游一商港</h3>
<p>〔本報江陰一月卅日訊〕本縣黃田港口，自從蘇北有了匪患，為進　船隻的大動脈。參議會　新江港建設計劃中對港口改進展望很高，要在沿江建築　船，建　倉庫，將來錫楡鐵路成功，溝通京滬綫，　　為長江下　唯一現代化商港。自從勝昌德商　　運麵粉失敗，一月十五日　　巨大貨船，爲未曾査驗，不准進港，遭風浪激翻五大艘，損失六七十億一案，商旅　視此港爲畏途，本縣居長江咽喉，</p>
<p>江面最狹</p>
<p>便於查緝工作，向來就有　卡設立。在上年十月間，成立江海支關，他們對內港船隻，幷不重視，主要是江面緝私工作，無論本國及外洋商輪，經過都要停泊港口，等候驗關，他們祇加査驗，幷不收稅，因爲已在滬鎭關口稅過，祇須照票，如果漏稅，査出後照章處罰，海關權過去在外人之手，俗呼洋關名目，一切文件，都寫英文，關單上都是中西合璧，因爲遭人反對，現在已改用巾文了。有了海關，港口報關行林立，達十數家之多，他　業務，每一船進出口貨船，都需要向　　　將　　吿物品名數量，運往及　　地點，詳細說明，　　驗證件，請求代辦　問手續，　關行方面，取些手　費，但沒有一定，每船少　數萬，多至數十萬不等。</p>
<p>冬令水淺</p>
<p>港口狹小，每天與對江靖江航運，輪渡有江靖，江利，大同，江順，五和等五家，共有渡輪六艘，都可容萬人左右，每客渡資三千元，現在水小，渡輪不能進港，停　在江邊，中問登岸，還要划子擺渡，每客需要五六千元，如果負有貨物，還要加倍，渡輪係輪流班次，每半小時一班，尙有揚子建中兩航商，係專運貨物至京鎭間，義渡局係救濟院管理，舊江陰靖江兩縣合作組織。現有義渡兩艘，亦挨班渡客，也收渡資，戰前是不取渡資的，事實上已沒有「義渡」意義存在了。此外，擺渡船從河東到河西，從港內到港外，共有七八十雙，渡資沒有一定，本港人和外帮人有不同價目，普通對河擺渡三四千，到港口兩萬元，他們最歡迎大商輸，因爲過港時抛錯登岸，報關請驗，從江心一個來　，起碼數十萬，海關支關門口一艘擺渡船，專渡　關的，每次五千元，而且是一家　營的，一家　關行每個月有數于一萬至百餘萬，收入相當可觀。爲了船隻擁擠，設有淸理河道服務員，</p>
<p>專司　擋</p>
<p>維持港內船隻秩序，但船隻　再先迅　進出，就需金錢運動，有錢排　先行，沒錢讓　停着，　致一艘猪船要數十萬，自從發生空前覆船慘禍，各方注重港口秩序，經孔司　嚴加取締後，港內船隻進出，已見良好，大小船隻魚貫而行，但恐不能持久，日久玩生。</p>
<p>糾紛最多的是起卸業組織，中間分成若干組，各組營業，分得很淸，互不侵犯，各組都有想當勢力，港口一組資力最厚，如果六越俎卸貨，馬上發生武劇，雖經黨政機關迭次開會規定，但尙未澈底解決，最近期內，縣府又須召開會議，切實定一辦法，以免糾紛之重演。此外尙有港口的黃包車夫，是「漫天討價落地還價」的，他們</p>
<p>主要顧客</p>
<p>是來往南北渡客，很多車夫　　　查所，擠到江邊，等到渡輪　岸，不　危險，蜂擁上船，在艙　軋來軋去，如有主顧，見有行李貨物，　　斤　，港口至北城汽車站，要　萬　萬，天雨要加倍。前天有一個女旅客，因有行李港口到北外小橋，化去十一萬兀，而且車夫打成一片，倘使乘客與　車夫講價不成，嫌價太貴，乙車夫會討得更高，使你不會有便宜可　，如果到普惠橋，就無此現象了。</p>
<p>澄邑與蘇北靖江，僅</p>
<p>一江之隔</p>
<p>，為防止　究起見，港口設檢查所，駐有軍警，檢査分旅客無船隻兩稱，對過往人身份檢査，最爲注意，船隻所　貨物，概須登記，但不收費用，自從覆船慘禍後，當局對港口情形，曾派員督導一切，都較前改進，査驗迅速完成。還有船舶管理所第機構，在港口實施其職務，地方人士，都希望此港繁榮，則新江陰建設計劃，庶有實現之希望。（醉）</p>

<h3>戰後中等學校分區計畫設置　敎育部發表施行成效</h3>
<p>〔大華社南京航訊〕敎育部前以戰時各省市中等學校或已停閉，或已歸併，或已內遷，亦有新增設者，變更頗多，中等學校之設置，大都已失平衡，故於戰事結束後，即令飭各省市，亟應利用復員機會，對於各類中等學校予以計劃設置，以期合理。頃據敎育部就兩年來實施情形，加以歸納整理，發表施行成效如下：　各省市大體均能依人口面積經濟交通及文化事業發展之程度，分別劃定中學區，師範學校區，職業學校區。　中學區，師範學校區，及職業學校區內各類學校，在地理上配合，尙能勻稱，無過分疏密之弊。其不同類之中等學校及初級之中等學校與中心國民學校之距離，亦能參照當地需要情形，予以適當之配置，以期盡量取得聯繫及升學之便利。　中學師範職業三類學校，除照中等學校區之規定設置外，其設校增班，均以左列比例爲目標，漸次推進：（一）初級中等學校：初中簡師初職三類學校班級總數之比例爲六·三·二。（二）高級中等學校：高中師範高職三類學校班級總數之比例爲二·一·一。　各省市設置各類中等學校之地點，類多依據下列各項原則：一。高中初中，設在人口較密，經濟較裕，交通較便利區。二·簡師師範，設在鄕村鎭市。三·初職高職：（A）各　農業職業學校設在農村；（B）各種工業職業學校，設在有是項職業可資發展及改良之地方，或富有是項原料可供製造，或有是項工廠可供實習之地方；（C）各種商　職業學校，設在商業較繁盛之都市；（D）其他各科職業學校之校址，均以適合所設學校科別之環境而便於實習者爲　則。　初級中學簡易師範初級職　，以由縣設立爲原則。各省集中力量，辦理高初中合設之中學或高級中學，師範學校，及高級聯業學校。　各省市各中學區內，如僅設有省立初級中學者，多已改辦省立高級中學或高初中合設之省立中學。如區內已設有高初中合設之中學或高級中學，同時並設有省立初級中學者，已酌量將省立初級中學逐漸改辦師範學校或高級職業學校，該區內如省立高初中合設之中學或高級中學師範學校高級職業學校，均已設立，多已將省立初級中學逐漸改歸縣立。　各省市於戰後遷移及新設之各類中等學校，均已於復員時，依照實際需要情形，令飭遷回原址，或留設現址，或遷至指定地點，妥爲調整。　中學數量過多之地區，已斟酌情形，指定改辦職業學校，並扶助與獎勵私人設立職業學校。　各縣增設縣立中等學校，均能儘先設立簡師，以應國民敎育師資之急需。</p>

<h3>兵工工程學院　名經四易　地已三遷　現正走向新生之路</h3>
<p>「兵工工程學院」這個名字，新近問世，恐怕有好多朋友們見了，一定感覺到陌生，吿訴你，朋友，其實並不陌生，牠的前身就是漢陽兵工專門學校，創辦於民國六年。那時附屬於漢陽兵工廠，後來因了經費支細停辦。等到民國十六年，改隸國民政府，才復校招考新生，嗣改稱軍政部兵工專門學校，於民國二十一年遷至南京中華門外。後抗戰軍興，西遷車慶楊公橋。民國二十八年，又更名爲軍政部兵工學校。勝利復員以後，舊校舍不敷應用，暫遷上海吳淞，於三十六年十月初，又奉令更名爲「兵工工程學院」。三十年問，名經四易，地已三遷，將來的永久校址，則決定在南京中山門外的白水橋。那裏山水優美，環境宜人，校舍現已興工趕建，俟完工後，即可遷往。兵工學院，現正走向新生之路。院內原僅「造兵」與「應化」兩系，今又增添了「戰車製造工程」，共計三系。所謂「造兵」，就是硏究各種武器的設計和製造。所謂應化，就是硏究各種應用化學工業及毒氣的製造和發展。至於戰車製造工程，從字面看來，即可了解。要之三系鼎立而並重，期在建立一健全國防工業人才訓練的基礎。</p>
<p>兵工工程學院的設備，向極充實，有理化館，有圖書館，有印刷所，也有兵器室和實習工廠，可供同學們的實地硏討，除此以外，署假時，同學們還可進國內各兵工廠，住廠實習，作進一步的研究。</p>
<p>說到敎授，全是海內敎育界名流，如楊公橋時代，在校任敎的樓光來，陸志鴻，張洪沅，高濟宇，孫光遠，張江樹，趙國華，丁觀海，嚴演存諸氏，無一不是博學之士，今由趙國華會石處等主持系政之下，敎授的陣容，異常堅强。</p>
<p>吾人深知國防的重要，作育國防人才自不容敷衍。而兵器理諭的研究，非程度較好的學生，更不可能登堂入室，所以兵工錄取新生，水準得高，往往數千人投考，而錄取的不　　　　人。因之，每次錄取的新生，　度　　整齊，更兼以學校環境優美，敎授敎課認真，加以設備完善，養成同學們濃厚的硏究空氣。料想有好多重慶的朋友們，常還記得：走近楊公橋，進了兵工學校，就正像踏進了和尙廟般，四境寂寂無聲，假如步近圖書館或自修室時，則又都坐得濟濟一堂，個個都在會精聚神地細細精研。正因爲如此，同學們經了四五年緊張生活的磨練，慢慢地淘冶出來，對於畢業以後所担任的工作，也就能應付裕如。兵工學院自開辦迄今，總共畢業同學雖不過三百四十五人，而目前在國內兵工界担任重要職務的，確實不少。說得具體些，一般認爲最最難考的敎育部公費留學，而兵工同學也能名列金榜，如民國二十八年趙國華同學的庚款留英，與去年徐階蘇同學的公費留美，即其一例。至於其他公私費留學或被派往國外考察與實習的，更不計其數，據個人所知：民國二十八年造兵系畢業的十五位同學中，就有十四位是到過美國的。老實設，凡是兵工畢業的老同學，很少是沒喝過海水的。</p>
<p>此外還可以奉吿的，就是在求學期問，同學們所用的書無儀器與服裝，概由學校供給，並且還有零用津貼，畢業後，由兵工署分發各兵工廠工作。因此同學們在校，沒有衣食之虜，自可安心求學，而畢業後亦無須自己去找尋工作，所以人家都說這是「鐵飯碗」。</p>
<p>兵工學院通常是暑假招生，本年度以正値遷校期間，所以直挨到最近才有招生的措施。此次招生，全國共分　陽，北平，西安，重慶，貴陽，武昌，上海，南京，台灣，廣州等十處進行，我竭誠歡迎錄取的新同學們，共同參加兵工的硏究工作。</p>

<h3>七戰七勝　華聯大勝大公　五二比三四相差十八分　情緒過緊大公表演失常</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三　　球聯賽甲組第一循環，華聯大公兩　昨晚爭覇戰之結果，華聯一路居先，以五十二比卅四獲得絕對之勝利，相差共計十八分，上半時爲十八比十一。華聯七戰七勝，大公則巳二遭敗績，冠軍已吿絕望，前途如無變化，行見第三屈錦標，仍將田華聯蟬聯。</p>
<p>昨晚決戰，吸引觀衆達六千餘人，體育館擠得水洩不通，門票收入達二億餘元，爲聯賽從來未有之盛况。憲警實軍，協力維持秩序。上海及勝利兩電台，同時播送戰塲實况。第一循環即吿結束，大公報復，須待來週。</p>
<p>華聯較勝大公一籌</p>
<p>因情緖之惟有時亦有同聲贊好之表演。全局競爭，相常劇烈。大公似失常態，蔡文華被李震中看煞，始終未擲中一球，僅罰得三點，爲昨晚大公慘敗之一點。上塲起用詹琛，戰略値得考慮。屠文龍，蔡忠强，較弱，未能與羣聲三將配合。擲籃機會不少，但失的累累，籃下落球，皆入華聯之手，此皆爲大公之弱點。</p>
<p>華聯始終居上風，亦較大公鎮定，大李包松圓最爲出色，陳學崇亦時有傑作，吳成章籃下搶球獨步，僅劉福善任相成較差耳。全局概觀，華聯人材平均，確勝大公一籌也。</p>
<p>自始至終追隨局面</p>
<p>蔡文華先開紀錄，罰中得分。開始即陷於優局，華聯十二分，大公尙祗罰得三分。費柏齡替出詹琛，文章文龍才見得中，大李球方脫手，笛聲已起，球入籃圈，上半時華聯以十八比十一佔先。</p>
<p>下半時華聯任相成入替劉福善，蔡文章連中二球，追成十八比十五，大公似有轉機希望，呼聲四起，惜乎未能抓住此黃金機會，再進一步，吳成章包松圓又見得中，大公仍以四五分落後，蔡忠强易出黃柏齡，分數愈去愈遠。最高時爲四十九比二十八，相差達廿一分。蔡文華五次犯規出塲，草草完成殘局，結果爲五十二比三十四分。</p>

<h3>預選隊長表演平平四比二小勝西聯　下半時連中二次十二碼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海區參加世運足球預選代表隊，爲試練合作，活動脚頭，昨日下午與本市西聯隊作練習賽於逸園。隔夜天雨，雖已放晴，但觀衆因之裹足，僅得球　約計五千人。西聯隊攻勢殊猛，上半時預選隊以各一平手，下半時西聯又中一球，二比一佔先，預選隊迎中三球，反敗爲勝，結果四比二。</p>
<p>世運隊精神欠佳，姍姍來遲，比賽直至二時五十五分開始，代表隊祗九人登塲，嚴士鑫離滬，李義臣誤卯，費春華開賽方來。先拉陳家萬入局，陳見義勇爲，拔刀相助，形勢趨於平均，費春華來後，才凑十一人。</p>
<p>精彩不多西聯活躍</p>
<p>全局精彩甚少，吳祺祥最穩，孟義良看住小黃毛勞勃斯托夫，打三後衛，因此常見中衛綫與前鋒脫節，益以韓龍海未能出人頭地，更見奄奄無生氣。孫錦順寳刀未老，一般看來，未能迎合觀衆希望，到香港尙須努力。西聯氣力甚足，後衛稍差，中衛前鋒俱出色，鐵伏尼　住孫鐵腿，勞勃司托夫始終爲危險人物，其得中一球，美妙無匹，擦門木而下，F愛德華衝刺之速度可畏，格里那司亦可讚美，其第三四兩球之失，皆為十二碼，不足論英雄也。兩隊陣容如次：</p>

<h3>經濟部長接見記者　暢談當前經濟問題　紗花布管理必須官商合作增產通運後燃料可以敷用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部陳部長昨在寓邸接見記者，就記者所提問題，分別作答，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>化　　管理問題：政府對花紗布之管理，目標有二：一在　此穩定花紗布價格，二在促進　　工業之發展。管理辦法，在實施統購統銷，代紡代織。並擬訂有關之實施細則六種，刻已全部由經部核定，正待次第公布施行。新辦法訂定後，　在必行。上海各民營紗廠，　　法廳為實行有困難，在辦法未實行前，實係揣測之詞。蓋辦法實行究竟有無困難，　須待實行後方知。實行後如遭遇困難，可再提請紗管會袁主委及經濟部考慮克服困難之辦　。惟最重要者，即目前各紗廠命運，實與政府同一途徑。故務必開誡合作，方能挽救目前危局。</p>
<p>原棉供應問題　原棉來源，可從下列三方面收得：（甲）儘量搶購全國產區原棉。（乙）以外銷紗布，易取外棉。（丙）自　貸中劃撥一部份，購買外棉。除上述三種來源外，再加現有存棉，則相信原棉之供應，在半年內不致發生問題。</p>
<p>燃料問題　京滬區燃料之供應，過去側重仰給於東北開　。後積極注意：（甲）在上海陸續積煤廿萬至卅萬噸。（乙）工廠用煤自給自足。（丙）促進各區煤礦增產。上海去年十二月十日起，至本年一月廿日間，因北煤米源受阻，即係依存煤維持。增產方面，淮南華東各礦半年前產量月僅八九萬噸，刻已增加至十六萬噸。長江流域各省產煤，經半年來之努力，產量已足敷長江各省自身之需用。惟運輸工具較缺，故本人正設法實現各省分區自給計劃。茲者淮南華東　興各礦存煤共達十八萬噸，再加台煤調劑供應，而開　煤運最近亦已好轉，故燃料不致發生根本問題。</p>
<p>物價問題　政府對物價問題，始終注意，花紗布之管理，金融管理局之設置，全面配售計劃之實施，收購定貨政策之施行，凡此種種，均係爲全面穩定物價而來。檢査倉庫之舉，如有需要，當斟酌實行。農曆年前，如物價有異動，中樞當有特殊辦法以應付。</p>
<p>美國援華問題　我國復興當首求自力更生。惟我國　八年抗戰，兩年內亂，復興時　自力更生外，能再獲外援，則復興過程，當可較　。且美對我援助，半亦爲　自助。今日對我援助愈大，可减輕美國將來對遠東問題之負祖。今日援助少，將來負担愈大。就客觀情形　，美援總額，需美金卅億元。內十億爲軍事援助，十億爲平衡財政及幣制整理，十億爲經濟復興建設。該項款額，當可視需要緩急，分期撥貸。</p>
<p>漢行觀感　最近漢口之行，主要任務，在視察經部在當地附屬機構及一般情形。深覺漢地工業情况，已無戰前之繁榮。蓋抗戰時期，後方主要之紡縱鋼鐵等工業，均係自漢遷去。戰時對後方紗布鋼鐵之供應，　功殊偉。勝利後雖無法全部遷回，惟鄂省仍不乏可發展之工業，舉其犖犖大者，有二棉紡，鋼鐵，機器，油脂，化學，等工業。燃料問題，鄂省戰前向仰給於六河　及焦作兩　，刻本省烟白煤增產結果，已有餘裕，可供外省。漢口工商界一般之苦痛有三：（甲）時局不靖，（乙）資金短絀，（丙）工廠設備，未能恢復戰前狀態。政府當於可能範圍內，設　協助解決。惟本人亦深望漢口工商界，除致力於農商業外，更應注重於工業之發展，俾增加武漢之重要性。</p>
<h3>六區棉紡公會代表　繼續商討細則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會遵照紗管會袁主委之囑，推定劉丕基·童潤夫·唐嘩如·韓志明·部實虎代表五人，定今日繼續與紗管會劉處長文騰，高處長炳泰等，商討細則云。</p>
<h3>魯豫治安不靖　菸商採購滇菸</h3>
<p>本市菸葉商行，採辦菸葉，向以山東河南安徽三地爲最主要。茲以山東情勢混亂，使靑州菸葉南來受極大之阻撓。河南許昌，近月共匪滋擾，致來源亦陷於斷絕。至安徽一帶，又以交通運輸之　滯，菸葉商前往採購，難免有增高成本及種種不便之感。爲此菸業商人近均轉移目標，重視滇省菸葉之採購。各菸業商行多派專員改道往滇，以西南省區時局平靜，對商業及行旅，能有更大之安全與把握。設山東河南等各地時勢迄未澄淸，則不久之後，滇省之菸葉，將成爲本市捲烟工業原料之主要來源云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕吾國美種　菸，向以山東河南安徽三省爲種植地區，範圍最廣，成績亦最佳。出產之菸業，品質勝於州土菸倍蓰。故歷年來國產之　菸，亦足取一部分入口之美菸而代之，成爲我國捲烟工業重要來源之一。抗戰期間，大部工商業隨政府而遷入內地，捲烟工業亦在西南各地積極發展。爲便於取給原料起見，雲南省之各地亦大事種植美種之菸葉，經各有關機關之銳意倡導，極著成效。品質甚爲優良，且產量亦甚豐盛，除供銷當地捲烟工廠外，後外銷於全國各地，旗省美種菸之種植，已成爲我國美菸盛產區之一云。</p>
<h3>易燃液體廠商　月底截止登記</h3>
<p>警察問接市商會函，以易燃液體廠商登記，原展限期，祗有一月，仍覺過促，請再酌予放長。現經警察局考慮結果，認爲易燃液體，申請登記手續甚簡，與核發許可證，須査勘審核者不同，允展限至三十七年二月底止云。</p>
<h3>論暹羅橋匯問題　暹羅僑匯的演變與投機</h3>
<p>— 劉佐人</p>
<p>暹羅每年的僑匯數目，雖有如此的鉅額，但因我國政府銀行在暹羅各地均無分支機構，且對吸收僑匯，又無適常的政策，故均係由私家銀號所寄出，加以官價匯率，與黑市匯率相距日遠，更加甚僑匯逃避之風。私家銀號批局旣均係個人或私人集團所組織，自然均唯利是圖，以賺錢爲目的。以前潔身自愛的批業，尙能以匯撥業務作其專業，但因國幣無法逃避逐步下跌的厄運，逐漸地轉向於金融投機。在家醉心於期匯交易，本來期匯交易亦是華僑匯款，不過它不像寄批款頻的幾乎百分之九十以上，是瞻養家屬的費用而是大額匯返家鄕建置產業，或匯往汕頭作高利貸的款額，另含有生產作川。但因匯批業本身均唯「期」是尙，其他游資更同時加入作戰，形成爲金融的投機，「打空」成風，只要是便宜的期票，大家都樂於下手，對信用反不顧及，因之危機便在這種情形下孕育了。</p>
<p>所謂期匯交易，即在暹羅收若千暹幣，規定十日內在汕頭交國幣若干。譬如一月份平均批價價格，是每萬元國幣合暹幣四十二銖，亦就是在暹羅交暹幣四十二銖，在汕頭可收國幣一萬元，因爲批價之日漸梯形下　，煽動了一般批業的投機心理，商塲眼光也均集　於此一門，一般心理是「每收必賺，靑盲也像放盤」，根本不需要什麼內行與見識。於是張三李四都來組織銀信局，匯兌莊，均誇「信用保家」或「回批快捷」，盤價無須知行情，橫豎後市看跌就是了。</p>
<p>尤其是去年六月下旬，正是期匯交易的狂熱時期當時以遠洋公司之吐量最鉅，而且價格又每每在一般民營匯業界的前頭，以爲吸收的法寶。譬如六月下旬民營匯業期盤結價，是四銖五十至四銖六寸，遠洋公司即僅收四銖至四銖二十五，故當時該公司放出的期盤，便以同業票佔絕對多數，一般批業向遠洋公司或其他次等字號大量吸入，然後轉而放出，扣取微利，這樣無異把本身信譽作爲下賭的本錢，担當了全部「風火」的責任。遠洋公司和其他空頭家的無限空頭主義，以前也嘗有一個時期是得心應手的，可是因七月廿二日魏特邁抵華之後，上海美元迅速下降，暹羅汕匯逐漸攀升，汕匯即時回漲至六銖之外，於是放盤者焦頭爛額。遠洋公司等相繼倒閉，其總額約計四百億元，內遠洋公司一家即達二百億元以上，折合暹幣約爲二千禽銖，幾佔全部羅暹僑匯的二十分之一。</p>
<p>故說起來，暹羅橋匯去年所以遭受空前不幸之倒風，實是因爲暹羅批業自相戕伐，互相以盲目的瀉價爲競爭手段，所造成的險惡的結果，實是値得我們警惕的敎訓。</p>
<p>爭取邏　僑匯的途徑</p>
<p>綜觀上述，可見　羅的僑匯雖鉅，但因政府對僑匯無正確適當的政策，使僑匯不但流入黑市，且因僑匯流入投機之道，造成倒風，使僑胞更受切身的損害，影響今後僑匯的吸收，所以必須針對目前的情形，作適當的改進，其急待改進的，主要的有下列幾個問題：</p>
<p>第一：儘量接近黑市外匯價，以消滅官價與黑市匯價的差異，使僑匯不致因官價結匯引起鉅額的損失，而逃避於黑市。匯率的高低，決於國家的金融政策，與貨幣制度，尤有密切的關係。這雖爲國家整個經濟金融貨幣政策問題，但因有黑市的存在，政府似不能不顧及僑胞的利益，即對僑胞收解兌換國幣的數額，應該盡可能地照市價折算。否則利之所在勢必令僑匯逃避香港，如果牌價無法任意更變時，亦應採取補貼政策，對補差的數額，且須隨時提高，以接近於或不低過黑市匯價爲原則。</p>
<p>第二：普設吸收僑匯機構，及加強與批信局之聯繫。因爲居留暹羅之華僑，不像南北美洲華僑均集中於大城市，而係分散於各鄕村及小城鎭，所以不但應在暹羅大城市如曼谷等地，設立國家銀行之分支機構，且應在其他重要城市如靑邁·合文，等四五城市，設立國家銀行機構，以普遍吸收僑匯。更爲全部掌握全部僑匯，以免僑匯流入黑市，及　機之途計，仍須與暹羅各地批信局密切聯繫，其方法即凡批局所受之匯款，由我國銀行按照黑市匯價悉數代爲匯出。或在香港代爲轉匯，使外匯能全部落我國銀行手上，則不但政府可能支配僑匯，且因僑匯不致流入黑市，減少黑市外匯對國家經濟金融所發生之不良影饗。</p>
<p>第三：對於國外吸收僑匯的機構，固應普遍設立，在國內僑胞故鄕之地，如汕頭海口等處，亦匯）增設解款機構，並應盡量多準備現鈔，使僑胞能就地得現款，不致發生覓舖擔保，及無法取得現鈔等困難。並對僑胞舉辦各項服務事項，如代寫郵信，傳達消息，代爲設計，解答疑問，及僑眷小額放款等，以便與僑胞聯絡感情，僑匯必可日增。（完）</p>

<h3>原子能在和平時期的貢獻</h3>
<p>— 癯叟譯</p>
<p>在世界的原子能管制間題尙未獲得解決時許多人曾談論到將原子能使用在和平的工作上。本文爲紐約時報之著名科學編輯甘福特（Waccemar　Kaempffert）氏所著對於原子能在和平上的貢獻和使用的可能性作一詳盡的檢討。原文載於十月份Survey　Graphic雜請－譯者</p>
<p>爆發於廣島和長崎上空的原子彈，已是兩年多前的事；原子彈威力之大，莫說一般門外漢爲之咋舌，即造成這炸彈的科學家們當時也驚異不置。萬能的人類終於達到了釋放原子能的境地，一般富於幻想的人們，便推測在不久之後，衍道上來往的車輛和天空中翱翔的飛機，都將用原子能來推動，即整個城市所需的動力亦將從一兩磅鈾中取得，好像一個使用原子能的大同世界就在眼前，人類可以不再斤斤於燃料的價格而能使用極便宜的原子能了。</p>
<p>但是市塲上各種燃料的價格却並未因此而劇跌，許多電力廠中反而訂聯新的蒸氣鍋爐和發電機來代替舊有的機器，也許有人要問這究竟是怎樣一回事？</p>
<p>原子能在和平的用途上究有多大的貢獻？使用原子能是否會造成人類另一次工業革命？這是許多人亟欲知道的問題。在一般機械學家看來，在大城市中，使用原子能的工廠，將可作爲正規的工廠；或者在燃料特別缺乏，特別昂貴的區域中，用來產生動力，但不致取今日煤和油的地位而代之。因爲今日工廠中所用的新式燃煤機，已達到極高的效率，要產生每小時一匹馬力的能量，平均祇要使用一磅煤，因此在美國許多大城市中，每一小時使用一瓩的電力，祇需三分至五分美金，而實際上發電廠製出每小時一瓩電力所需的燃料，祗要二匣牛　元，最多亦不過五厘，其他的大部份費用，都化在電力的傳佈，公司的管理，抄義的工作，和另件，會計等項目上，這些開支，即使在我們達到了使用原子能的時代，亦不能免去。所以任何新的能產生動力的原料，要和煤與油競爭，那末祇能在這燃料費用的五厘美元之內競爭。至於在使用水力發電的區域內，原子能更絕無用武之地，因爲大自然所供給的水，旣不需分文，而且取之不盡用之不竭，而純淨的「鈾二三八」至少要二十美元一磅，另一種用來製造原子彈的稀有的「鈾二三五」至少要七千美元于磅，甚至高至一萬餘美元一磅。一部份對原子能樂觀的人士則說，鈾的價格雖高，但是像哥爾天球一般大小的一磅純淨的鈾二三五，所能發出的能力要抵到一千五百噸煤，或二十五萬加侖汽油，或是八千萬立方呎煤氣，或四千禽立方呎天然氣體所能發出的能力，但是計算起來，其利益仍微乎其微。</p>
<p>一般不明隙原子能原理的人，常認爲我們可以很容易地直接使用原子能來供給家庭中的電和熟，其實這種車情之不易辦到，正像我們不能川閃電的力量來行駛火車一樣。現在讓　們先簡略地一述使用原子能的原理，再提到它的困難。</p>
<p>稀有的鈾二三五的原子，一定要受到　子（Neutron）的衝擊然後分裂，分裂後使有更多的中子散開來，衝擊其他的鈾二三五和鈾二三八的原子。鈾二三五受到衝擊以後裂開，鈾二三八則獲得中子而成爲鎮（Ptutonium），這　可以作為爆炸品，亦可以作爲發電廠中電力的來源。這種連索恤擊反應之能够產生熱，正和我們用鎚子不斷地鎚一塊鐵能够產生熱屬於同一原理。在美國橡嶺（Oak　Ridge）製造原子彈的工廠中，這種熱力都任它放散在空氣中，另一個在漢福特（Hanford）的原子彈工廠，便將道熱通到哥侖比亞河中去，雖然祗使河水增加了極少的溫度，但是這熱力已足驚人了。許多美國的機械學家對於這種大量的浪費，曾屢次表示不滿；美國陸軍部方面對此表示非常抱憾，因為在戰事進行時，他　將全部精力集中於製造原子彈的工作上，沒有兼顧到這一方面。目前在橡嶺已有一家飛機零件工廠在試用這種原子衝擊時所放出的熱力。在還沒有正式的專實與所需的費用發表時，科學家所作一切關於使用原子能來產生動力發電的言論，都祗是推測而已，其中有不少都不免想像太過。</p>
<p>若是我們竟能將原子衝擊時所發出的熱力，直接導往蒸汽汽輪中，或用來作燃水　熱力，發出蒸汽來推動機器，那末我們的發電廠中的鍋爐裝置，常然要與現在的不同；不渦在鍋爐間以外，其他一切都仍完全一樣，我們的傳電綫，傳常分站，和電表，電燈，電車，種種電具都無需改變。所以第一個可以肯定的問題便是在使用原子能以後，我們的生活習俗等社會要素並不會有改變，不會造成一社會革命。</p>
<p>在經濟方面言，據聯合國原子能委員會的調査和統計，目前要在美國東部建立一個能發電七萬五千瓩的原子能發常廠，需要二千五百萬美元。而在同一地點建立一同樣力量的燃煤的發電廠，最多祗要一千萬美元。並且原子能發電廠中所用的鈾也需要一筆大資本，也許要幾百萬美元之多。</p>
<p>原子能委員會之作這種比較還沒有包括使用原子能發電時一切技術上的困難問題在內，其中最重要的便是幅射性的問題。我們都知道　錠所發出的光綫，具有極大的力量，人類不能受到它的直接照射。但是在用原子能發電時所用的一個「鈾堆」——一根根的鈾棒置於石墨中成一方格形——所發出的半綫，其力量之大更是不可思議。所以即使在最小型的原子發電廠內，亦需要用五十噸鋼鐵與水泥來築一個具有五　厚壁的火爐。在這「　堆」發生作用時，沒有一個人可以接近，而使用過的　棒，必需用間接控制的方法移去，換進新的。在橡嶺和漢福特兩地的原子彈工廠中，這種工作已做得極爲周密，所以至今沒有一個人受到損傷。但是要在每一個普通的原子發電廠中辦到這一點，那又是另一件事了。</p>
<p>除此以外，還有許多問題　要解決，而且必須化費巨大的　本先作研究的工作。最重要的，是要使　發出的光綫不波及所要加熱的水。在使用原子能作燃料加熱時，用一種液體從管子由經過原子分裂所發出的高熱，再將這管子通往管子一定要用某種適合的原料製成某一適當的厚度，而且要絕對緊密，如果有一絲水蒸氣從管子中漏了出來，那末其危險性已不堪設想了。廣島長時上空爆發的原子彈使許多日本人民喪生，其中有不少並未直接炸死，乃是受到了放射性光綫的照射，白血球被殺害，血液從皮膚下滲透出來，因而致死。所以在一個使用原子能的工廠中工作，若無極度慎密的管制與檢査，便有很大的危險性。受到放射性光綫的水，便不能再通到普通的水道中去，否則整個河流中的水便都要被波及。運一隻被放射綫殺死的老鼠，也不能立刻埋葬，若是埋葬在泥土裏，何要使這塊泥土受到影響，如不幸而被其他動物扒鬆了泥土掘出這老鼠，那末危險更大了。</p>
<p>總之，這防禦放射綫的問題首先需要解決，人類才能利用原子能。也就因爲這個問題，使我們理想中所有的原子能推動的汽車與飛機不易實現。祗有在大郵船中，才能有利地使用鈾作動力。因爲在大郵船上可以裝置五十噸重的大鍋爐而無不良的影響。如果船隻竟然使用鈾作燃料的話，那末在裝了一次鈾以後，便可以航行百萬哩而無需再加，因此船上放置油或煤等燃料的地位，可以作其他用途。所以使用原子能，對於海軍造船家極爲有利，他們可以在船上裝置更大的汽輪，獲得更高的航行速率，且能在戰艦上裝更厚的　甲。英美兩國現在已考慮建造使用原子能的大戰艦；若是聯合國原子能管制委員會能允許的話，那末航行太平洋大西洋的船公司，亦將計劃建造比今日的伊麗莎白皇后號和曼　皇后號更快的原子能大郵船了。（未完）</p>
<h3>單雌生殖之子裔性別決定</h3>
<p>— 謝冶英</p>
<p>（一）緖論</p>
<p>凡是有兩性分化的生物，受精彷彿是產生後嗣所必不可少的條件如果旣經成熟的卵子，得不到受精　機會，結果便不免衰萎而消滅。一般情形，固然是如此，但却並不能一概而論。動植物中，有若干種類的卵子，可以無須徑愛精作用，即能產生子嗣的。這種生殖法，在生物學上稱之爲　雌生殖（Parthenogeneiis）。亦稱處女生殖。詳言之，所謂單雌生殖，乃是有性生殖之一種，其卵子不須經受精作用即可演發的。（Parthenogenesis　in　a　mode　of　sexual　reoroduction　in　which　ova　cevelop　without　leinge　ferilixed）此種演發，雖屬無性，實際却由已　性的分化之雌性生殖細胞所發生的，因此就不能和無性生殖混爲一談了。</p>
<p>單雌生殖，無論在動物或植物方面，都巳發見很多實例。在植物方面，如水生菌（Saplolegniae），輪藻（Cnara），蕨類植物，臘梅，白花涌公英，黃瓜菜，茄科之曼陀羅花，烟草，以及禾本科之小麥等。在動物方面，則更爲普　如輪虫類之輪虫，　殼類之水蚤，昆蟲類之密蜂，蚜虫，竹簡虫等。如果　加　察，在各種動植物之單雌生殖，情形實非常複雜。就動物方面說：動物的單雌生殖，普通可分別爲　假兩類：</p>
<p>真單雌生殖（True　parthenogenseis）：營單雌生殖之卵，或徑减數分裂而染色體成爲單組（Haploid）的，例如蜜蜂，壁蟲等類，或不徑减數分裂而染色體爲雙組的，（Diploir）如介殻虫，竹節虫，輸虫，　虫等。</p>
<p>假　雌生殖（False　parthenogenesis：這是冒牌的單雌生殖，卵子雖不受精，可是卵核往往與其他　胞的核（例如極體）相合以後，才開始分裂。或則卵核逕裂爲二再互相融合。</p>
<p>至於植物的單雌生殖，普通可別爲三類。</p>
<p>單雌生殖（Parthenogeneois）：卵子不經受精而發育爲胞子代植物體的，如曼陀羅花，烟草，剪夏羅黃瓜菜，置等，這一類裏，卵子或經减數而染色體爲單組，或不經减數而染色體爲雙組。</p>
<p>無配生殖（Apogamy）：卵細胞以外的細胞，如助胎細胞反足組胞等，不與其他細胞融合，有時亦能成胚，如　及齒類植物中嘗見之。</p>
<p>無胞子生殖（Aposporr）：由胞子以外的細胞；發育成爲其有藏精器及藏卵器的原葉體，嘗見於　類及蕨類。</p>
<p>嚴格的說的單雌生殖，應該只限於由卵子不經受精而能單獨發育後嗣的一類講。不消說：動物的假單雌生殖，植物的無配生殖與無胞子生殖，均不在範圍本題討論範圍之列。而且在植物方面，胞子世代無性世代，要利用她來解釋單雌牛殖子裔之性別，不是合適的模式，因此就不得不徧重於動物方面來討論，這是應當在此先行聲明的。</p>
<p>時至今日，我們不僅知道在動物界裏，有若干種類行　雌生殖是一種天然生殖法。（　一）且曾經許多生物學者的實際硏究，發現用人爲的方法，利用理化的刺激，也可使未受精的卵子行　雌生殖。前者稱爲天然單雌生殖（Natural　parthenogenesis），後者無爲人工　雌生殖（Artificial　parthenogenesis）。天然　雌生殖，多見于節足動物之田穀類及昆虫類，輪虫動物之輪虫類。而在　體動物，環節動物，棘皮動物等，用人爲的方法，可使其卵子單獨發育，（註二）但其結果則遠比不上天然單雌生殖的良好。</p>
<p>單雌生殖的子裔，有無性別的分化？是雄體還是雄體？其所以生成雌體或雄體的原因是什麼？這些正是下文所要詳加討論的。</p>
<p>（二）天然單雌生殖及其子裔之性別</p>
<p>天然單雌生殖之後嗣，均有性別的分化，但此種子裔之性別，恒視動物之種類而異，有些種類只能產生雄性的子裔，有些只能產生雌性的子裔；有些旣能產生雌性的子裔，也能產生雄性的子裔。所以就產生之子裔的性別論。單雌生殖又可別爲三類。</p>
<p>雄裔單雌生殖：產生之子裔盡屬雄性，如蜜蜂，螞蟻，　　之類。</p>
<p>雌裔　雌生殖：產生之裔，盡　雌性，如介殼虫，竹節虫，結　虫（Solenobia）輪虫之中Bcelloicesi以及柳葉蜂中之Cimbax　connata，oimtax　ovata等。</p>
<p>兩性裔單雌生殖：產生之子裔，可為雄性，亦可為雄性。如　蜂，蚜虫，水蚤輸虫等。</p>
<p>未受精卵單獨發育的結果，何以有些種類產生雄裔有些種類產生雌裔，有些種類，旣可產生雄裔，也可產生雄裔呢？這不僅是設生學上的問題，也是細胞學，還傳學上的問題。我們不僅要在發生學上找到牠們的事實根據，還得在細胞學上遺傳學上去根究其原因。（未完）</p>
<h3>無聲之音</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>聲音在我們的腦海中不外是美妙的歌唱，悅耳的談吐，悲壯的號角以及喧鬧的市聲……但是科學家却說聲音可以用來殺　，滅菌，消烟去霧，探索潛艇，促進化學變化，代替外科手術等。眞是不可思議！</p>
<p>超級聲波</p>
<p>原來聲音不過是物體的振動而已，人類的耳　可以感受每秒十六次至一萬六千次振動。超過這限度的聲音就聽而不聞了。然而大蝙蝠及鴿等動物都有較高的感受機能，牠們可以聽到一部分我們所不聞的聲音。</p>
<p>利用了電流或磁力去振　石英結晶，可以產生這種每秒在一萬六十次以上的振動，就是所謂超級聲波。</p>
<p>死音</p>
<p>瑪納博士（Dr.Mantner）爲著名的超聲波　家，博士以電波石英振盪器產生每秒千萬次振　的聲波，以抛物綫鏡集中射出，直達一百五十碼外的兎籠，五秒鐘後，兎子即完全麻痺，知覺毫無。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞大學試驗滅菌能力，測得鏈球菌極易爲超聲波所振斃。所以本來必須加熟半小時消毒的牛乳，只須通入超聲波數秒鐘，即消毒淨盡了。</p>
<p>探索潛艇</p>
<p>早在二十年前，博士已爲法國的潛艇裝置第一架探索儀。利用超聲波　反射而探測暗礁，敵艦和油岩等。這次大戰中發明的雷達完全根據同一原理，不過是利用無綫電波代替超聲波而已。</p>
<p>美國最近出品的金屬測厚儀可以在金屬板的一面（另一面看不到或觸不着）即可測知其厚度和堅硬度簡單便捷一如透視奇術。在金屬品，機械和鍋爐等製造和檢査上，頗有用途，這種測厚儀（Sonigage）也是超聲波的利用。</p>
<p>撥開雲霧</p>
<p>空氣受超聲波的振盪，細粒的塵埃和水氣被激動而集合起來，凝成大粒，終於烟消霧散。所以飛機塲和工業區可以大規模地在屋頂上裝置超聲波機，驅開濃霧和淨淸空氣，保障航行的安全和居民的健康</p>
<p>割除腦瘤</p>
<p>據哥倫比亞大學研究室的報告，傷寒感冒及小兒麻痹症的病菌可以超聲振斃後，作爲疫苗施種。不溶解於水的荷爾蒙可以利用超聲波的振　而製成乳劑，即可注射入人體，發揮藥力。頗有希望的一點是超聲波可以代替外科手術，割除腦瘤。地位測定以後，用二條聲波交射其上，或可消滅癌細胞或限制其活動，假如實驗成功的話，超聲波的貢獻將日益光大。</p>

<h3>數字分節的補充意見</h3>
<p>— 黃白虹</p>
<p>本刋廿三期孔繁淸君關於數字分節問題，他是對廿一期周實民君數字分節漢化一文提出的商榷，主張應該採用國際通行的三位分節法，我於廿一期周君文字未曾見着，可是我對於孔君的主張，是表示贊同的。</p>
<p>實則三位分節已成仳界通例，現在一切學術制度無不傾向國際化，各國已通行的，我們祗有適應時代無法與人立異，也不必與人立異，這也與歷法採用陽歷一樣，度量衡改用公升公斤一樣，公文上加用標點一樣，數目字一致用阿拉伯的12345…一樣，這不是洋化，是求我們自己的便利。不過　　所在，孔君尙未予以　明的，茲特爲補充申說一下：</p>
<p>按西法記數是以「千」（第四位）為常用最高單位，而我國民間却是以「萬」（第五位）為常用最高單位，（西法祗有十千，而無萬。）所以他們向以三位分節，而我國則似應以四位分節方爲合理，（周君所見，也許在此。）可是試査關國內各種書報表册，凡於數字的排列，「大多數是照三位分節的，於是筆下的記數，與口頭的念數，不能一致，每看一個數目，必須一十百千的轉數，才能呼讀出來，這實在是失却分節的意義。三位分節旣是事實上已經採用，那末對於常用最高單位·勢非改用三位的上一位，（第四位數）或三位倍數的上一位（第七位數）不可，但取消禽位（第五位數）不合我國習俗，於是祗有上升到億，兆，兆是第七位，便提升以兆爲常用最高單位。惟同時必須確定萬億兆爲十進，即十萬爲億，十億爲兆·　如四萬萬五千萬同胞，應改稱爲四百五十兆同胞，上海市三百五十萬人口，應該稱三兆五億人口，如此這般，豈不簡便？如是三位分節起來，第一節是個位起，二節是千位起，三節是兆位起，一望即可呼出，根本無須再一位一位的默數，這不是什麼問題都解決了嗎？</p>
<p>至於兆以上的數位，因爲不是常用單位，如果還是一個一個採用十進，則名數太多，反難記憶，所以仍應用國際通行的千進法，即每至千位始另提一命名，如兆以上爲十兆，百兆，京，十京，百京垓，……等，這自然仍是切合三位分節制。</p>
<p>本人曾於世界月刋第一卷六期，發表「算數命名及分節我見」一文，又曾於新民晚報去年十一月十七日，發表「億兆的處理」一文，均係如此主張，希望海內專家進而敎之。</p>

<h3>說陷遯</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>聖如孔仲尼，也不諱言「學而優則　」的話，不爲作官諱；無怪乎後代的讀書種子，十九莫不兢兢業業於「寒窗十載」之中，痛下「磨穿　硯」的苦工，以期實現其「學得經世術，售與帝王家」的願望。於是作官乃成爲古今文人視所當然之事，不做官倒是「例外」了。</p>
<p>自然，不願作官或是不敢作官的人，大都在其無可奈何的苦衷在。尤其在專制的王朝時代，皇帝頭子一手操着生殺予奪的大權，因此，少數愛好自由或不爲衣食所迫的文人，便反視作官爲畏途了。如晋之陶靖節，不願爲五斗折腰，寗可回家去吃老米，過着「采菊東籬下，悠然見南山」的閑散生活。漢之嚴光，縱然和劉秀的交情與關係都算不淺，可也寗願呆在富春江邊釣他一輩子的魚。還有更幽默的，如侯鯖錄記宋人楊朴不願作官的故事云：</p>
<p>「真宗東封，訪天下隱者，得杞人楊朴，能爲詩。召對，自言不能。上問：「臨行有人作詩送卿否？」朴言：「獨臣妻有詩一首云：「更休落魂貪杯酒，亦莫猖狂愛詠詩；今日提將官里去，這回斷送老頭皮。」上士笑，放還山。」</p>
<p>若楊朴竟認作官爲斷送老頭皮之事，可見官亦是可爲而不可爲的。無如熱中的人都認此爲「榮祖耀祖，增光門楣」的大業，因此，認爲「斷送老頭皮」的人就更寥寥可數，而被後來人當作高風亮節的隱士崇拜起來了。</p>
<p>時至今日，國爲民有，作官的已經成爲人民的「公僕」；而且，作官的黃金時代也已成爲過去，放眼看看那班在飢寒之中掙扎的窮公務員的實際生活，就不難知道作官者的可憐相了。可是，話雖如此，而傳統遺留下來的「學而優則仕」的風氣，似乎並沒有隨時代改變了多少。因之官之一途，仍爲多數知識份子逐鹿之地，官的圈子里，也大有人滿之患。有官可做而不願或不敢作的，自然仍可被視作「例外」的人的。筆者就有這樣二個不願作官或不敢作官的朋友：</p>
<p>一位是學文科的，原來以敎書爲生，後來被另一個朋友拉去帮忙，一度作了某省轄市的區長。這是親民之官，這位老兄幹了不滿三個月便悄然引退，仍幹他的老本行去了。事後探問他掛冠的原由，他却感慨萬千的說道：那還幹得！無論識與不識的人，一碰頭不問你的政績，或是困難如何，却總是翹起大姆指或是拍拍你的肩膀，說道：「這遭老兄可有辦法哪！」這個所謂「有辦法」也者，乃「撈上一票」之謂也。如此下去，樹大招風，貪汚固非所長，不貪汚又被惡名！思前想後，還是不幹拉倒。</p>
<p>另一位是高考榜上有名的角色。某省的主席不知怎樣對他很　青，一再的示意給他揀一個最優的縣份去當縣太爺。可是他經過再三的思慮，結果還是謝絕某主席好意的「栽培」。據他自己說：這年頭，控制自己個人不腐化，倒還容易；控制他人，却是大難。要幹，　果非出毛病不可！</p>
<p>據此以　，我這二個朋友的不願或不敢作官的動機，當然都與做「隱士」和沽名釣譽無關。只是，他們的話都値得玩味。固然，「淸者自淸」，「濁者自濁」的人格與操守，是涇渭分明的，更何况「蓮出汚泥而不染」的硬漢也並非沒有。可惜是在濁流的波濤汹湧下，淸流欲作中流的砥柱，乃是不容易的事情。於是有些人便只有望而却步，退避三舍了。</p>
<h3>親身體會</h3>
<p>— 季水</p>
<p>記得梁啓超先生在「最苦與最樂」一文中，末後一段有勸人去一嚐冬天的冷水，究竟冷到如何程度的話，這就是所謂「親身體會」。</p>
<p>祗有親身體會，才是最眞切的。偉大的同情，也就產生在這四個平淡的字裏·這次申報爲淸寒學生呼籲而發起的「讀者助學金」徵募捐款，有一位無名氏就深深感動，據他說他就因為親身體會到失學的痛苦，便特地送來五千萬元，一筆很可觀的數目，作爲「讀者助學金」了。也就說明了「親身體會」四字偉大的作用。</p>
<p>至於那些「脫下破棉襖，忘記討飯棒」的傢伙，那是別具心腸　，不能一概而流了。</p>
<h3>豈有此理</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>據柳南隨筆載：陳在之學詩於馮　遠，（均常熟人）盡得其指授，學問日進，而背　毁定遠，不造餘力。定遠恨甚，徧訴於邑中士大夫，在之反因此得名，於是邑中後進之士，從定遠遊者，或因聲名未立，遂有効在之故事者矣云云。可見風俗澆薄，歷代皆然。我以爲此種人簡直是瘋狗，雖然也算得「名」，其人格如何，已可見一斑。本來，青出於藍，亦事所常有，但這是以後用功的進步，飲水思源，你不該忘記你得到學問的起點，即使力學能勝，也不該背後詆毀師長，勝母之里，曾參不入，可以為鑒，何況陳在之的才藻終不及馮定遠呢！但我們平心而論，馮定遠懲窒工夫，猶尙未足，這種小子，本不値一駡，駡之，徒汚口舌，一笑置之可也。語云：「見怪不怪，其怪自敗，」此與古人在燈下觀書，突見鬼臉，由小而大，其人將燈吹滅云：「恥與魑魅爭光」是一樣的意思，而馮定遠却不能忍受，徧訴之於邑中士大夫，使此小子，反因此僥倖得名，眞給這小子便宜不少</p>
<h3>談罩子</h3>
<p>— 介丁</p>
<p>小時候最愛看武俠小說，刀來槍去的塲面，解數的使法等等，眞會敎人要上峨嵋山學武藝去。那些書裏所寫的「金鐘罩」「鐵布衫」之類的本領更顯得出色，功夫到家的人只要一運氣，渾身上下就會鐵一樣地結實，刀劍劈到身上反而彈開去，豎脚的刀就會折口，力小的人也會震裂了「虎口」這些本領倒真是防身第一法寶，只要有了它，嘿，就不會任何人來傷害我，而自己倒可以隨意去打人家。</p>
<p>只是一樣不滿意：小說作者往往在「金鐘罩」上安下一個「罩門」，或在脇下，或在喉底，或在頸後，總是有一個地方，只要用手指輕輕一戳，就馬上可以把「罩」的功夫全部破了，而本領大的人也就一命嗚呼，一個有「金鐘罩」功夫的俠客，往往就喪命在「罩門」上，可見罩子也決不能眾得天衣無縫的。</p>
<p>年歲略大些，才知道專在自己身上做功夫以防挨打是最笨的辦法。眞會耍本領的人就專把罩給人家，把別人罩住，譬如老虎獅子之類的猛獸，抓了來用鐵柵一罩，它們的威風就毫無舒展餘地了。連小孩子們都可以隔了柵欄拿香蕉皮粟子壳去擲它，胆大的還可以對準它吐唾沫。把人家罩住，常然自已決不會被害了。</p>
<p>獅虎之類究竟還是獸王，把它關起來了也就忘了它過去的兇暴，而且人們只能遠遠地招惹它幾下，却不敢真的去捋虎鬚拍蒼蠅的。那些慣做奴隸的牛馬却用不着鐵籠：街上拖車子的馬，要上兩個眼罩，使得它只能從限定的空隙中看着脚前的一方路面，決不能左顧右盼；一匹磨豆腐的驢子，一頭牽水車的牛，却用眼罩把眼睛全部蒙住了，使它們看不見地面和旁邊任何東西，才能敎它乖乖地打圈兒。如果把它們的眼罩除了，那會成什麽世界啊！馬看到了路邊熙熙攘攘的人羣，吼呌着飛快地從身邊擦過的汽車，會駭得跳起來，即使不驚慌吧，爲了馬眼可以自由斜視，走路也不會那樣莊嚴端雅了。如果是打轉的牛去了眼罩；看見整天轉來轉去只是那一點點地方，走上幾年也沒有走開一步，一定會發瘋的，又是不斷地團團轉打圈子，君見旁邊的事物不斷在眼前搖幌，也得暈厥過去。它們的東家當然也不願要它們犯了常規，也就非在牛馬眼睛上牢牢地安上眼罩不可。</p>
<p>罩子的用處當然不見得就這樣簡單，譬如防蒼蠅竄擾就得用紗罩，抵禦「病從口入」的口罩，防風的風翠，儀器上的玻璃罩，貴婦人臉上的面眾……各式各樣，用法也自然不同，說也說不完。</p>
<p>不幸事情並不那麽簡單，罩子雖可以代表隔閡歧視，而堅硬的罩子正如小說家所說的金鐘罩和天羅地網，都有被戳破的可能，祗要找出了「罩門」——有的罩只要在任何地方一擊——輕輕地打一下，就什麽罩都失去了效用。</p>
<h3>第三次世界大戰以後（下）</h3>
<p>— 伍必熙譯</p>
<p>乙：　位，我們決不能讓這衝突來形成另一次戰爭</p>
<p>丙：你別脅制我！難道你有了世界上唯一的手槍我便怕你不成？</p>
<p>甲：好了，好了，別再鬧了。我們是僅有的三個了，像這樣鬧下去好像世界之大還不能容納我們三個人。</p>
<p>乙：假使世界之大可以容納我們，那末你爲什麼不肯放棄一個澳洲？</p>
<p>甲：哦——那世界之大不是這個意思。</p>
<p>丙：你看，你還要呌我　北美一洲呢！</p>
<p>乙：我有一個提議，因爲我們對土地的要求意見不能一致，所以不如將這事延緩討論，先作一個調査再說。</p>
<p>甲：我附議。</p>
<p>丙：贊成的舉手。好，這過，我提議現在討論分配火柴的問題。</p>
<p>乙：這火柴必須作爲人類共有的財產，我提議由我們三人平分。</p>
<p>甲：這提議簡直荒謬！第一，火柴是我尋着的，爲什麽要作爲人類共有的財產？第二，八根火柴三個人如何能平均分配？</p>
<p>乙：那末你的意見怎樣？</p>
<p>甲：我主張給你們每人兩根火柴，我拿四根和那隻火柴盒子。</p>
<p>丙：這提議絕對不能接受，我使用否決權否決！</p>
<p>乙：請各位別意氣用事，　慢地商議。</p>
<p>甲：唉，這眞是可恥的事，將寶貴的時間化在無聊的辯論上，對於重建世界的工作反而置之不顧！</p>
<p>丙：（對乙）這話你認爲如何？他掌握着火柴但是却不主張辯論。別担心，祗要你給我們火柴，我們立刻便開始重建的工作！（少停）</p>
<p>甲：請諸位原諒……我提議暫時休會片刻。（甲走出，乙注目視之，然後興奮地與丙耳語）</p>
<p>丙：這個辦法使得，（拿起一根木棍）來吧！</p>
<p>乙：是不是要先給他一個措詞强硬的字條呢？</p>
<p>丙：我們可以在事後再給他，先給他一個出其不意！（乙，丙兩人下，頃刻後槌擊之聲作，憤怒呼呌之聲繼之，然後爲甲埀死時之呌駡聲。少許乙，丙回。）</p>
<p>丙：我們已剷除了人類的公敵，這一下子眞功勞不小。好吧，給我四根火柴吧！</p>
<p>乙：四根？爲什麽要四根</p>
<p>丙：一人一半分贓，不是最公平的事嗎？</p>
<p>乙：你這人一點沒有良心，這一下子是誰出的主意？</p>
<p>丙：不錯，不過第一個下手的是我啊！</p>
<p>乙：這簡直不成其爲理由。這裏祗有三根火柴，要不要隨你！（丙憤而舉起木棍，乙掏出手槍射之，丙倒於地，乙靜靜地坐下，取出香烟燃火柴吸之。）</p>

<h3>犬與貓</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>我對養狗有特別的愛好，回到鄕下後想養一頭，覔了一個多月仍不得「佳種」。鄉下多的是癩皮蛻毛的野狗，都不大討人歡喜。</p>
<p>最近在上海看了「義犬尋主」的影片，竟使我十分感動，十餘年前看了「狗明星」琳丁丁的表演，至今猶未忘懷。</p>
<p>一位有名的英國作家，在他的一篇「論犬與貓」的大文章里道：「貓只在坐下不久的學步的時期是可愛的，法國人說：女人應該在十七歲上誕生，到三十歲就死掉；貓應該生下不久不等它長大就死掉」！接着他又掉轉筆鋒對狗大大讚頌一番，因為那位作家原是狗的「偏愛者」！</p>
<p>狗是馴良的忠實的僕人，你撫摸它，它搖搖尾巴表示歡迎，効忠。同樣，你撫摸一頭貓，它只閉着眼睛不加理睬，冷冷淡淡，絕少「反應」和親熱的表示。彷彿它們的靈魂是詭秘莫測的，無須倚賴別人而能生存，頌揚也罷，贊美也罷，它們一律表示無關痛　而處之漠然。這就是法國人所以把貓看作絕然逈異於狗的靈魂與精神的原因了。</p>
<p>對狗與貓這兩種動物，我們不必存什麼偏見，且看一下偉大的法國人巴斯加的褒辭吧：「人類我看得太多，我最喜歡的是狗」！在文學上更有不少贊美狗的文字可讀，拜倫的贊頌忠誠的人類的諛辭贊頌忠誠的狗，「紐芬蘭犬之墓銘」末兩句道：</p>
<p>「紀念一個長眠於石下的朋友，</p>
<p>我僅知－他臥居在此地」。狗是忠誠熱情的伙伴，爲你工作，爲你奔走，甚且爲你而死。因此文學史上乃有不少英勇的事　的記載了。</p>
<p>貓呢？自私，詭詐，陰險，神秘，正如「化身博士」日間爲善夜則作惡的二重性格。他謐靜地躺在熊熊而燃的壁爐旁蜷伏在地毯上像一個瞎了眼的巫婆，從它的身上發散出蠱惑，詭譎，恐怖的氣息！</p>
<p>然而狗却把它的心擎握在掌中，他的生命如白晝，沒有蔭蔽，沒有秘密，是那麼一個率直淳樸的傢伙！貓遠離人的生活，而狗却像你自己的影子緊緊追隨，須臾不離，成了你生活中不可缺少的一部份。却爾斯里特（Charles　Reade）批評一個人道：「他不過是一個人，但他却忠心如犬」。這是他贊美一位英雄的話－「他却忠心如犬」。看看它們的勞績；牧羊，狩獵，守門，偵緝，傳令，……它是永遠虔誠爲你服務的一位忠實的朋友！</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第九章　洩漏機密（六〇）</p>
<p>肖柏看了喜道：「好了，你再唱。」雲卿又把「　陽天，春光好，百鳥歡喧」重唱了兩遍，那鸚鵡把兩翼一振，在架上跳了兩下，似已覓到聲音所在。　柏又道：「右門了，　　　再唱。」雲卿又唱了兩句，那鸚鵡果然也學了起來，　　不　大笑。　柏　：「不要笑，一　　完了。」雲卿又唱兩句，那鸚鵡只在架上，跳來跳去，不唱了。肖柏笑道：「這　西就是這樣討厭，愛唱時一逗就唱，不愛唱時，怎樣逗他都不唱，現在不用逗他，地不會　唱了！你來屋裏坐吧。」雲卿跟他走進屋內，肖柏躺在短榻上，把足一曉，指着窗外鸚鵡道：「我每日總要逗牠一兩次，開開心，從前渚齋最愛逗牠，他最有耐性，敎他幾句　，總要叫他學會了，他才走。最近渚　總不見面，不知他整天忙些什麽，你有見着他沒有？」雲卿見肖柏提及渚齋，正是一個機會，忙趁勢說道：「他很忙，近來又鬧出一宗事，和他太大離婚呢！」肖柏驚異道：「爲什麽和他太太離婚？」雲卿道：「我也不大淸楚，據他太太說，渚齋要娶顧綺紈，才和她離婚。」肖柏道：「渚齋這孩子太胡鬧了，他家裏老太爺，能答應嗎？」雲卿道：「大槪還瞞着老太爺呢！」肖柏道：「他老子絕不會贊成的。」雲卿道：「現在靑年人，那顧得許多！要想幹，用盡法子，達到他的目的，那怕家庭如何反對，他是不顧慮的。」肖柏道：「渚齋這一着弄得大錯特錯，他那能娶綺紈呀：綺紈也不能嫁給渚齋的，等我把他呌來，問個明白。我要指點他，別入迷途。」雲卿道：「這是表伯的熱心，可是說時，別提是我說的。」肖柏道：「我何必提到你。我要以正義勸導他，呌他回頭，他娶綺紈有稀種害處，沒有一點好處。綺紈嫁他，將來也要後悔，並且渚齋是有婦之夫，那能嫁給他。這事我不知道，那不用說，我旣知道，便要挽回他，免他家裏鬧出風波。」說着便打電話到銀行裏，請渚齋就來。雲卿覺得肖柏立刻要把渚齋呌來質問，自己在這裘不便，談了一會話，便託辭忙忙走了。雲卿離開費宅不久，渚齋也就來到，肖柏一見渚齋，含着滿臉笑容道：「渚齋你好久沒來，你快辦喜事，我要喝你的喜酒，你怎麽也不通知我一聲？」渚齋聽了，心裏不由卜通一跳，强行鎭定說道：「姑丈說什麼喜酒？」肖柏道：「這樣大喜，你還想瞞我，外面誰不知道你快和綺紈結婚？」渚齋道：「姑　聽誰說的？」肖柏道：「我祇問你有這事沒有？」</p>
<h3>報銷述異</h3>
<p>— 雷</p>
<p>作家福胡勒在開始寫作之前，是當通訊記者的。某次，奉報社命，到加拿大北部荒野中去打聽幾個失踪飛行員的下落。他想用的是　館裏的錢，多費一點何妨；但一切費用，忘掉了記好一篇細賬。</p>
<p>常他回國覆命時，他發現自己已經化了三千元美金。爲了報銷，他只得求助於回憶和想像。他把北極區所有需要用的設備與衣服都開出來：雪鞋雪橇羊毛內衣，毛皮衣服，耳罩等等。經過了一小時的思索，用心費力，總數只有二千八百元。</p>
<p>他又絞了一小時腦汁，於是想起了他帶到冰地中去，不幸死掉的一隻獵狗。他派了兩個人另外去弄了一隻狗來代替—費用一百三十元，不－一百五十元。尙有五十元沒有開明用途。</p>
<p>福胡勒在搜索枯腸之後，寫出了最後的用途，這是一種情感的用費。賬表上最後一項這樣寫着：「死狗前面供獻的鮮花－五十元。」</p>

<h3>方望溪誣李風主</h3>
<p>— 鄭過官</p>
<p>理學之名，肇自宋儒，然朱陸異同之見，畛域難泯，於是「支離」「空疎」遂為考亭（朱矢）象山（陸九淵）兩派學說集　之的。（呂東萊祖　邀考亭亭九淵互會於鵝湖，各證所學，意欲融貫而一之，而朱以陸為空疎，陸以朱為支離，其說終不能合而罷。）自來其於朱陸之外而能自立赤幟者，惟清代顏習齋（元）而已。習齋弟子中，以李剛主（塨）最能守其師說。昌大之功為巨。風主與方望溪（苞）友善，苞嘗命子道章從剛主學，然不以風主之非程朱為然，（其與剛主論學之書，備載望溪集中，讀之可知。）及剛主歿，望溪為作墓志，謂剛主晚年終因方說而改其師法。顧讀風主之怨谷集，其詆程朱，固始終未嘗回意，望溪所云云者，殆出門戶之見，未必果屬事實。是以劉調贊撰恕谷年譜，力辯其罔，且謂望溪純構虛詞，誣及死友，其言曰：「宰相謀徵先生，而靈皋（方苞）以老病阻之，時先生年六十五，米嘗老病也。或曰：靈皋與先生至厚，知先生必不出也。然先生一生志在行道，非石隱之流也。……竊觀靈皋與先生交至厚，而學術不相合，每相與辯學，先生侃侃正論，靈皋無能置詞，則　遁詞以免。曁先生歿，為先生作墓志，於先生道德學業，一　序及，僅樓陳其與先生及　繩先生（王源）相交始末，巧論　　曰：以剛主之　信師傅，聞余一言而　然改其意。固欲　先生之學以自見者，此豈能有朋友相關之意乎？」竊意以李剛主之尊信習齋，不　七十子之服　孔子，謂其聞望溪一言而翻然改意，誠不可信。至謂風主之不獲用，由於望溪之阻，則似未免深文周內，望溪宜不至此。矧望溪亦何所畏慮而必忌其出仕哉？惟　望溪生平，初「南山集」之序，實其所撰，及戴名世　作，望溪對簿，堅不自承，雖倖免戳，有愧高令公（允）多矣。及此之誣李剛主，皆足為其一代文宗（桐城派始祖）立身之玷耳。</p>

<h3>US-China Negotiations Becoming More Concrete: Aid Loan to China to be Decided by Month's End, Remaining Supplies to be Transferred According to Contract</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] US aid loans to China are gradually becoming more concrete. According to reliable sources, a concrete outcome for this loan is expected before the 20th of this month. This is a major achievement after several days of discussions between Ambassador Stuart and Advisor Chuan Jingwu with Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang Qun. The main reason is that after Zhang Qun proposed an economic plan, he demonstrated that China already has a strategy for self-reliance. Additionally, Mr. Bei Yizhi's negotiations in the United States have also been quite successful. US aid is now an inevitable trend. However, this loan is not a new allocation of US aid to China, but rather a portion of the Marshall Aid to China plan. The amount may not be less than what outsiders speculate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Hamilton, a New York Times reporter covering the United Nations, interviewed our representative Jiang Tingfu today. According to reports, Mr. Jiang stated that he believes that if China can obtain US$500 million in foreign aid annually for the next three to four years, the Chinese government will definitely be able to establish peace and economic order. Mr. Jiang did not indicate that China would propose this aid plan to the United States but emphasized that the problems caused by internal strife and inflation are interrelated. Mr. Jiang also discussed the issues of Japan and Korea. Regarding the latter, Mr. Jiang believes that although the Soviet Union refused the UN delegation to Korea to enter North Korea, the delegation should still strive to hold elections in South Korea and establish a provisional government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st, United Press] A report sent to Congress by the US Foreign Liquidation Commission stated that the main task currently in handling US surplus materials in the Far East is to transfer the materials that should be provided to China and the Philippines according to the US-China and US-Philippines wholesale contracts. The cooperation and working conditions of the Chinese, American, and Philippine representatives are currently excellent, and the various plans formulated are being advanced in an orderly manner. Japan and Korea can continue to select and purchase various materials from the US upcoming list of publicly auctioned items and surplus materials. The report also stated that China often has difficulties in receiving US ships at Subic Bay. This work may not be completed until 1949. If the US Navy Department cannot provide the assistance China needs, or if China's original plans change, the United States will take measures to cancel the contract with China, transport the ships back to the United States, and hand over the sale of these ships to the Congressional Liquidation Commission for handling. As of December 31, 1947, the original value of surplus materials sold by the United States in the Pacific China area was US$4,082,700,000, of which 76% (approximately US$3,512,000,000) had already been sold. The report also stated that the United States earned US$632 million from the sale of surplus materials in the Pacific and China areas, approximately 18% of the original value.</p>
<h3>Draft of Provincial and County Autonomy Under Review by National Government Subcommittee; Yu Jiaju Advocates Partial Implementation First</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The implementation of provincial and county autonomy after the implementation of the Constitution has attracted considerable attention from the general public. Some people previously believed that, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the popular election of provincial and county governors should be launched immediately. However, given that some areas are amidst prolonged warfare, it is practically impossible to universally launch popular elections for provincial and county governors. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Chapter 2 of the draft Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules regarding implementation procedures, counties implementing county autonomy should meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>- The security and defense are well managed.</p>
<p>- The finances are well organized.</p>
<p>- Household registration is completed.</p>
<p>- Land registration is completed.</p>
<p>Provincial autonomy can only be implemented after more than half of the counties within a province have completed autonomy. Regarding this issue, the reporter inquired with Government Commissioner Yu Jiaju. Mr. Yu believes that if these regulations are fully adhered to, the implementation of provincial and county autonomy will be delayed for a very long time. Therefore, this point seems to be worthy of considering amendments. Mr. Yu's opinion is that it may be considered to temporarily not implement provincial and county autonomy in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>- Areas in wartime.</p>
<p>- Fortress areas.</p>
<p>- Economically depressed areas.</p>
<p>- Provinces and counties with sparse populations.</p>
<p>The above points are all based on facts. However, this draft is currently still under review and discussion by the National Government Committee subcommittee, and there is no conclusion yet. Regarding Premier Zhang Qun's statement that the implementation of provincial and county autonomy should be after the downsizing of provinces, Mr. Yu said that many people's concerns about downsizing provinces are based on the past evils of warlord separatism and the difficulty of organizing the people's power to resist the enemy in combat. In fact, downsizing provinces is an academic opinion, and if it is immediately implemented, there will inevitably be some difficulties in practice, and the aforementioned concerns are unlikely to reappear now. Mr. Yu believes that some large provinces can be slightly divided, but full implementation may not be necessary. Mr. Yu also believes that today, after the implementation of the Constitution, since provincial and county autonomy cannot be implemented immediately, a transitional method can be used to replace it. How the form of provincial and county governments should be stipulated in this transitional method remains to be studied.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison, Sun Lianzhong, officially took office at the headquarters on the morning of the 1st. The handover ceremony began at 10:00 AM, personally presided over by the former concurrent Commander Zhang Zhen. More than 500 officers from the Garrison Headquarters participated. The Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, and the Chief of Police, Huang Zhenwu, also attended the ceremony. At the beginning of the ceremony, Zhang Zhen gave a brief introductory speech, stating that General Sun Lianzhong is a famous general, and now that he is taking office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison, he believes that he will definitely be able to further strengthen the capital garrison work in the future. Mr. Zhang also traced the security situation in the capital since he took office, saying that several unfortunate incidents had occurred in Shanghai, but fortunately, no similar incidents had occurred in Nanjing. He expressed his gratitude to the officers of the headquarters for their assistance during his tenure. Subsequently, Sun Lianzhong gave a speech to his officers, putting forward three points:</p>
<p>- The responsibilities of the Garrison Headquarters are quite extensive. He hopes to ensure that everyone in the jurisdiction can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>- Regarding personnel matters, he will not make changes lightly.</p>
<p>- Everyone must be responsible at each level to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun also stated that he has now taken on the capital garrison work and will work hard based on the Chairman's instructions and the foundation laid by Commander Zhang in the past. At 10:20 AM, after the speech was over, Zhang Zhen accompanied him to the Commander's office to take charge of affairs. At 10:30 AM, Zhang Zhen shook hands with Mr. Sun and bid farewell. Mr. Sun personally escorted him to the outside of the Commander's office, and Mr. Zhang got into the car and left.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Reviewing Administrative Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] With the establishment of the new government after the implementation of the Constitution imminent, the Control Yuan discussed the overall review of recent supervisory work at the Yuan meeting on the 31st. Control Yuan members He Hanwen, Fan Zhengbo, and others proposed to conduct a thorough review of the current government's administrative measures over the years and provide opinions as a reference for the new government after the implementation of the Constitution. The proposal has been approved in principle and handed over to He Hanwen and others to collect information and conduct detailed research. There is no concrete decision on how to present it.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Prominently Publishing Li Zongren's Election News</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 1st] The New York Times recently published Li Zongren's news about running for vice president in a prominent position and included a photo. The newspaper stated that China will produce the first popularly elected president and vice president in mid-March of this year. Chairman Chiang's election as president is foreseeable, and General Li Zongren, one of the six military leaders in China who has openly campaigned for vice president, has a high probability of being elected.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Correspondent, 31st] Cheng Qian has decided to participate in the vice presidential election and has sent personnel to various provinces to campaign. Liu Zhenqun, Director of the Military Law Department of the Governor's Headquarters, came to Jiangxi for Cheng's affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 1st] The delayed election of the Guizhou Provincial Legislature has been finally resolved. The Provincial Election Office received a telegram from the General Office yesterday, stating that all candidates who had already been announced with voter signatures registered but were not nominated by political parties would have their qualifications revoked. The list of remaining qualified candidates was also re-announced today. Among them, the two signed registrants, Long Songnan and Xie Zhongfu, and the remaining fifteen people were all proposed by political parties. Ballot papers are being rushed to be printed, and the entire province will vote simultaneously on February 21st, 22nd, and 23rd.

<h3>Establishment of Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the Border Area of Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces; Guangdong Construction Department Re-plans the Province's Highway Main Lines</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 1st] It is learned that the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the border area of Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces will be established on the 1st. The headquarters will be located in Nanxiong County, Guangdong. Ye is appointed as the Commander-in-Chief, with Song Zhongying and Guo Siyuan as deputies. In the future, matters related to bandit suppression and the command of teams in the three provinces will be the responsibility of the Headquarters. In addition, after the closing of the Guangdong Provincial Police Security Department's reorganization meeting on the 31st, Song Ziwen gave instructions on the bandit suppression plan to representatives of the commanders in each region. According to Hu Changqing, Commander of the 64th Division, who has just returned to Guangzhou from northern Guangdong to report on his duties: Since the launch of bandit suppression in northern Guangdong, 72 attacks have been launched successively, killing more than 700 bandits, capturing 1,000, and many bandits have surrendered. The bandit forces in northern Guangdong have gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 1st] In order to cooperate with military and political progress, the Guangdong Construction Department has decided to re-plan the province's highway main lines, including 17 provincial loop lines and 16 branch lines, covering the entire province.</p>
<h3>National Economic Commission Discusses and Approves in Principle: Our Government Has Not Yet Made a Decision on Tariff Reductions in Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The National Economic Commission discussed the method of adopting an import-export linked system for international trade on January 30th and approved it in principle. However, the government is still studying and considering it. Although this method can compete for foreign exchange, its implementation will inevitably have both advantages and disadvantages. It is learned that the relevant authorities are considering this matter in approximately two aspects: Regarding its advantages:</p>
<p>- When the official exchange rate is too far from the black market rate, exports are obstructed. At the same time, the government has to reduce import quotas due to the reduction of foreign exchange sources, which will inevitably fail to meet the legitimate needs of the domestic production sector. The adoption of this system can invigorate import and export trade.</p>
<p>- The linked system subsidizes exporters with a portion of the profits earned by importers, without the need to increase the burden on the national treasury.</p>
<p>Regarding its disadvantages, there are also several points:</p>
<p>- Currently, China's export value is far less than its import value. After adopting this system, exports can be expected to increase, but the increased amount will still be used for imports. Therefore, imports will also inevitably increase proportionally. Importers will compete to purchase linked foreign exchange from exporters. In the case of supply falling short of demand, the black market foreign exchange will be stimulated.</p>
<p>- Since the import value is much greater than the export value, the government's abandonment of all export exchange settlement income is still not enough to balance imports and exports. It only reduces the government's foreign exchange sources and still has to bear most of the foreign exchange required for imports.</p>
<p>- There are two types of linked systems: individual and comprehensive. Individual linking is suitable for industrialized countries, where manufacturers import raw materials and export finished products, which is difficult for China to imitate due to its backward industry. As for the comprehensive linked system, although it can export bristles and silk in exchange for machinery, etc., it is bound to allow them to be resold because they are not needed for export. Linked foreign exchange will cause speculation and arbitrage.</p>
<p>- The foundation of China's exporters has always been weak, and most of them still have to go through the hands of foreign merchants. After import-export linking, exporters may not be able to obtain real benefits and only create opportunities for foreign merchants to profit. Therefore, the government is unlikely to adopt this system in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] Zhang Tianze, Director of the International Trade Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who went to Geneva to attend the second preparatory meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment and the tariff reduction consultation meeting, returned to the country and arrived in Beijing a few days ago. According to his statement to reporters, the result of the Geneva meeting on tariff reduction was the agreement on the Geneva Agreement tariff rates. Representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries attending the meeting have submitted applications to their respective governments for approval and have been implemented since January of this year. China has not yet approved it. According to the Geneva Agreement tariff rates, the tariffs of various countries will be generally reduced compared to before. Taking carpets as an example, the old tax was 60% per square foot, while the new tax is only 40%. However, China is a backward industrial country and advocates maintaining protective tariffs. Therefore, it is not yet known whether this new agreement tariff rate will be implemented. In addition, the issue of foreign exchange control was also discussed for a long time at the meeting. Some countries advocated that countries should open up foreign exchange and not impose controls. However, countries that have suffered the pain of war advocated controlling foreign exchange. The United States strongly advocated opening up foreign exchange and proposed that countries should control foreign exchange until 1950. It was not passed at the meeting, but it was decided that after a certain time limit, countries could negotiate and relax foreign exchange control measures.</p>
<h3>Report on the Investigation of the North China Petition Delegation; Three Control Yuan Members Returned to Beijing After Completion; Huo Baoshu Asks to Increase Official Foreign Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] Control Yuan members Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting, who went to Shanghai to investigate the report submitted by the North China Petition Delegation, have completed their tasks. Yu Shude returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the evening of the 1st. After the two Control Yuan members Miao and Li return to Beijing on the 2nd, the three will draft a report based on the results of the investigations in Beijing and Shanghai. It is learned that Yu and others visited Zhang Jiaao and Huo Baoshu in Shanghai. According to Zhang Jiaao's statement to the three Control Yuan members, the control of Shanghai foreign exchange has now been relaxed. In the past, the foreign exchange rate for Shanghai foreign exchange was too high, reaching as high as 25% at its peak. Now it is only about 10%. For the purchase of flour in Shanghai by the Pingjin Municipal Government, the Central Bank can adopt a foreign exchange mortgage method. It only needs to pay the money to the Central Bank in Pingjin and can be used in Shanghai. Huo Baoshu stated that too much Tianjin export goods are stockpiled and cannot be exported because the difference between the foreign exchange rate and the official price is too large. If the official foreign exchange rate can be increased to gradually approach the black market rate, and merchants can profit from it, export goods can be circulated. Zhang and Huo both expressed their willingness to provide relevant information to the Control Yuan members.</p>
<h3>Our Ambassador to Bolivia Has Submitted His Credentials</h3>

<h3>Guo Chan Returns to Beijing; Will Visit the Chairman Today to Report</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] Guo Chan, Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Command, returned to Beijing by car from Xuzhou on the 1st, after attending the joint defense meeting of the four provinces of Henan, Anhui, Shandong, and Jiangsu on the orders of Chairman Chiang.

<p>[Our Zongjiang Correspondent, 1st] It is learned that the focus of this four-province joint defense meeting, in addition to strengthening joint defense in the enclosed bandit areas, was to follow Chairman Chiang's instructions, earnestly purify officialdom, alleviate the people's difficulties, and handle relief work. In the future, if the military and political chiefs of the pacification districts and counties are ineffective in their execution, negligent in their defense, they will be removed from their posts for minor offenses, and severely punished for major offenses, and the first batch of graduates from the suppression and construction training class will be given priority in distribution to fill vacancies based on their experience.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits Implement the Three Checks; Many Cadres Are Killed</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 1st] A senior military officer told reporters: The Communist bandits have decided to intensify the bloody struggle this year. Their "revolutionary budget" this year will cause 150 million people to lose their lives, because the ideal population of China for the Communist bandits is 120 million. Dong Shaocheng, Section Chief of the 12th Military Sub-district of the Communist Bandit Jidong Military Region, surrendered to the National Army on January 24th. According to him, the Communist bandits have two central tasks this year: The first is the party purification and three checks movement, that is, checking the position, checking the ideology, and checking the class origin. The class origin check traces back to the grandparents, parents, and the person themselves. Those from landlord, capitalist, or intellectual class backgrounds are all considered speculators and are killed. Many cadres who have worked for many years have been killed. He has worked for the Communist bandits for six years, and he escaped and surrendered because his life was threatened by the three checks. Along with this cruel policy of the Communist bandits, he brought a large number of documents. The purpose of this terrorist action by the Communist bandits is to eliminate the middle cadres and directly control the ignorant masses in order to consolidate their violence. Another central task this year is land reform, the content of which is nothing more than further destruction of rural stability.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st] The killing of Communist bandit cadres in the Three Checks movement is heard daily. It is learned that Zhang Wenang, the liaison minister of the Communist Bandit Luliang Military Region, was labeled as a class enemy and killed. Zhang Bandit once served as the Administrative Inspector of the Sixth District of Jin Province. In 1939, he rebelled and served as the Deputy Commander of the New Army of the Jin-Sui Border Region and the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Jin-Sui Administrative Office.</p>
<h3>Completion of Two Buildings in Wuhan: Reconstruction of the Telecommunications Bureau and the Municipal Hospital</h3>

<h3>The Pingyu Railway is Restored and Open to Traffic; The Situation in Eastern Hebei Turns Stable; Remnants of the Nie Bandit Flee to the Hebei Border</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] After the National Army swept the area along the Beining Railway between Ping and Yu, the security has become tranquil. The railway, which was damaged on the 29th, has been restored and opened to traffic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 1st] General Lin Weiyun recently came to Tianjin from eastern Hebei and went to Ping to report on his duties to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. According to him, the situation in eastern Hebei is stable. There are very few bandit tracks south of the Beining Railway, and very few bandit troops north of the railway. The railway has been spared major damage, but minor damage is still inevitable. Most of the damage is done by children driven by the Communist bandits. Nearly 300 people who broke the road in groups of three or five have recently been captured east of Changli. Most of them are ignorant children and have been sent to Ping for education.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] A strong force of the National Army recently attacked the four regiments of the Liu Bingyan Department of the 10th Military Sub-district of the Communist Bandit Jizhong in the Yongqing and Baxian area. The bandits suffered heavy losses and fled to the south bank of the Daqing River. The National Army is pursuing the victory. In addition, a certain unit of the National Army in the Hebei-Chahar border area launched a sweep against the remnants of the Nie Bandit Second Independent Division, which had been wandering in the area, on the 28th of last month. A lot of chopping and protection was done, and two grain and fodder warehouses and one gunpowder warehouse of the bandit army were destroyed. A large number of materials were captured and are being cleared. The remnant bandits are fleeing to the Rehe border, and the National Army continues to pursue them.</p>

<h3>Regulations for the Evaluation of Taxable Goods: Revised and Promulgated by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Ministry of Finance has revised the regulations for the evaluation of taxable goods for commodity tax, which were officially promulgated on January 31st and circulated to all provinces and cities to be implemented from February 1st. The provisions of the regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 These regulations are enacted in accordance with Article 5 of the Commodity Tax Ordinance, Article 4 of the National Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Ordinance, Article 5 of the Mineral Product Tax Ordinance, and Article 16 of the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of the Commodity Evaluation Committee of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Article 2 The duty-paid price of each type of taxable goods shall be assessed separately by region according to the circumstances within the jurisdiction of the commodity tax sub-bureau.</p>
<p>Article 3 After the duty-paid price is determined, the tax payable shall be calculated according to the statutory tax rate. For the sake of convenience in affixing stamps and other collection techniques, odd fractions may be waived in the calculation of the aforementioned tax amount.</p>
<p>Article 4 The duty-paid price and the tax payable shall be assessed once a month and reviewed comprehensively every three months. All calculations shall be based on the average wholesale price of the market for one month, from the 21st of the previous month to the 20th of the current month, according to the statutory formula and tax rate, and shall be publicly announced and implemented on the 1st of the following month. The months of January, April, July, and October each year are designated as comprehensive review periods. After evaluation by the Evaluation Committee, the results shall be submitted to the Taxation Department for approval by the Ministry of Finance and then issued to the tax authorities in each district for public announcement and implementation. In the eight months of February, March, May, June, August, September, November, and December each year, the tax prices and amounts shall be assessed and reported by each district bureau or directly subordinate bureau to the Taxation Department for record. However, if the tax price and amount are lower than the previous period, the tax shall temporarily continue to be levied according to the tax amount approved for the previous period until approval is received, and then the revised levy shall be publicly announced.</p>
<p>Article 5 When directly subordinate bureaus assess the monthly tax price and amount, they shall consult with designated district bureaus.</p>
<p>Article 6 When assessing the duty-paid price of each type of taxable goods, the following methods shall be used separately: For taxable goods that have been registered with the Taxation Department using a legal trademark, the duty-paid price shall be determined on a brand-by-brand basis in principle. However, under appropriate circumstances, the price may be determined by grade according to value. For goods without trademarks or local products, the actual sales situation in the market shall be carefully considered, and the duty-paid price shall be assessed and classified according to their quality and wholesale price. If the quality and wholesale price of the same type of goods are too disparate and it is necessary to classify them by grade, the number of grades shall not exceed four.</p>
<p>Article 7 The duty-paid price determined according to the price limit or negotiated price of government agencies shall be adjusted immediately by the district bureaus or directly subordinate bureaus if the price limit or negotiated price changes and implemented first, while reporting to the Taxation Department for record.</p>
<p>Article 8 Each district commodity tax bureau shall adopt a key point approach based on the actual distribution of all taxable goods in the district, formulate a survey market for each type of taxable goods, and report it to the Taxation Department for record. The wholesale price of the main taxable goods in that market shall be used as the main basis for assessing the duty-paid price of that type of taxable goods in that district, and the wholesale prices of other secondary producing areas shall be used as reference materials. The aforementioned regulations on survey markets shall be based on proximity to the producing area in principle.</p>
<p>Article 9 If taxable goods have seasonality or other reasons that make it impossible to find continuous market prices for reference, the most recent wholesale price may be used as the basis for calculation. If they are newly manufactured goods without a formal market wholesale price, the ex-factory price may be used temporarily as the duty-paid price. When there is a wholesale price in the market, it shall be adjusted according to the wholesale price. If the price is limited or negotiated by government agencies, the price limit and negotiated price shall be used as the basis for assessing the duty-paid price.</p>
<p>Article 10 If it is difficult to accurately survey the actual wholesale price of various types of taxable goods in the market, the Taxation Department may be requested to assess it separately according to the retail price.</p>
<p>Article 11 Each commodity tax sub-bureau shall designate a special person to be responsible for surveying the market wholesale prices of various types of taxable goods produced within the jurisdiction of the bureau, recording them daily, filling them in the prescribed survey form, and calculating their average wholesale price. They shall be submitted to the Taxation Department and the district bureau in charge every five days. The district bureau shall also designate a special person to be responsible for reviewing and statistically analyzing the price data reported by each sub-bureau, and shall submit it to the Taxation Department every ten days. Each directly subordinate bureau shall report the price to the Taxation Department daily. The various form styles and form filling instructions shall be determined separately by the Taxation Department.</p>
<p>Article 12 When each bureau surveys the market wholesale price of taxable goods, it shall pay attention to the market conditions registered by the industrial and commercial groups in each place and the market prices published in local newspapers. The price survey publications of local public and private institutions shall also be collected for reference. Other relevant government agencies' price limits or negotiated price methods and implementation status shall be reported at any time.</p>
<p>Article 13 If merchants in various industries have objections to the duty-paid price assessed in the comprehensive review or monthly assessment, they may state their reasons, submit supporting documents, and send them to the industry association for submission to the Taxation Department for review by the Evaluation Committee. Merchants who have not formed an association may directly submit the request.</p>
<p>Article 14 If the Evaluation Committee reviews the opinions submitted by the association or merchant and considers them unreasonable, it shall send them to the Taxation Department for clear reply.

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On the Reynolds Expedition to China</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>Mr. Milton Reynolds, known as the "Ballpoint Pen King," and his party recently came to China from the United States, passed through Shanghai to Beijing, and declared that they would go to western China for high-altitude exploration with five objectives: to use radar to measure the height of the main peak of Mount 積石 (Amunemaqin in Tibetan); to investigate glaciers; to study topography; to explore the source of the Yellow River; and to take photographs. The budget is estimated at US$155,000, with specially equipped aircraft. Chinese scientists are welcome to participate, and a base will be set up in Chengdu, etc. Here, we would like to express our views in order to urge the relevant scientific authorities in our country to pay attention to exploration and development, survey nature, increase human knowledge, and broaden our horizons. This is the noble purpose of scientific research, and advanced scientific countries in the world are mostly doing this, such as the Soviet Union in the Arctic and the United States in the Antarctic, both of which have actively carried out such explorations, achieving remarkable results and making great contributions. In the past, our country felt the lack of manpower and financial resources, resulting in very little exploration of the high mountains, great rivers, border areas, and hinterland within the country, which was regretted by those in the know. Therefore, whenever foreign scientific groups come to China for exploration, they have never failed to express welcome. Examples in the past include the Asian Expedition organized by the American Museum of Natural History, the Swedish Central Asian Expedition, and the French Haardt-Citroen Trans-Eurasian Motor Expedition to Peiping.</p>
<p>However, the Reynolds expedition to China this time is quite abrupt. Its organization, nature, purpose, itinerary, timing, team members, etc., have not been heard of beforehand. There is no record in Chinese and foreign newspapers either. It is said that they are currently in negotiations with the authorities of the Academia Sinica. Mr. Reynolds only received reporters and made a statement after arriving in Nanjing, explaining the five objectives and introducing three or five team members. It can be seen that there is no thorough preparation. It is important to know that exploration work has a dangerous nature. If it is not planned in detail and prepared properly in advance, it is inevitable that things will go wrong and difficulties will be encountered temporarily. Not only that, but exploration activities are outdoor scientific research, and even more so not an act of seeking fame and fortune by individuals. The goals must be determined in advance, with sufficient preparation and expert planning, in order to ensure success. For example, if high-altitude surveys are to be carried out, there must be experts in meteorology, geography, geology, zoology, botany, and surveying and physics to work together. In terms of work, part of it is aerial surveying and photography, using radar to measure the height of mountain peaks, and part of it is ground exploration to determine the location of high peaks and the direction of nearby mountain ranges, and to draw maps. If glaciers are to be investigated and topography studied, glacier geology experts (Glacial Geologist) and geomorphology experts (Seomorphologist) must participate in the work. Among the Reynolds expedition team members, in addition to pilots, photographers, and mechanics, there are only two or three scientific experts. It can be seen that there is no comprehensive plan or proper arrangement for the scope of work and the selection of team members in advance. Suddenly coming to China for high-altitude exploration, we have a profound feeling of the true purpose of the team.</p>
<p>Furthermore, modern exploration is not comparable to ordinary travel. It involves national defense secrets; this is related to sovereignty and cannot be ignored. At present, few European and American countries allow people from other countries to freely enter the hinterland and conduct exploration work of unclear nature. Mr. Reynolds is the owner of a ballpoint pen company and has not heard of any exploration experience. Leading the team eastward, part of the funding comes from donations from the American Life magazine. It can be seen that the expedition has a strong commercial advertising color, rather than purely scientific exploration. According to international practice, exploration of a non-scientific nature is generally not allowed to enter the country, let alone be sponsored. If there is exploration of a military reconnaissance nature, it must be strictly rejected.</p>
<p>According to a Chicago cable a few days ago, another important mission of the Reynolds expedition is to explore the reserves of uranium (Ura-nium) ore in the major mountain ranges of western China, using secret instruments for systematic exploration and estimating their reserves. Uranium is the main raw material for the manufacture of atomic weapons, and the great powers are making every effort to explore and investigate it. The United States and the Soviet Union have already ordered a ban on exports in order to strengthen national defense. If the rumors are true, then the mission of the Reynolds expedition is indeed not what it seems. It is hoped that our national defense authorities will pay close attention to it!</p>
<p>Also, scientific exploration teams coming to China often have disputes due to non-compliance with agreements or our country's laws. For example, the aforementioned Asian Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, under the leadership of Chapman Andrew, did not comply with the Sino-American cooperation agreement after reaching its destination and clashed with the local government, eventually leading to negotiations. The French Trans-Eurasian Motor Expedition, led by Andri Haardt as the chief leader, adopted a Sino-French cooperation method in our country, led by a certain French military officer, who was domineering and did not respect our country's sovereignty, ignoring the opinions of our country's team members, causing a major dispute. Other examples include the Sino-Swedish Scientific Exploration Team, led by the famous explorer Sven Hedin, which inevitably ended in personal friction and discord. What is even more unbearable is that the Englishman Auriel Stein's archeological work in Xinjiang did not comply with Chinese laws, causing unanimous opposition from our country's academic and cultural circles, and he was eventually expelled by our government. All the examples cited, the distant ones are more than twenty years ago, and the recent ones are more than ten years ago, and those who have experienced them still have fresh memories. Learning from past mistakes, the Reynolds expedition to China this time is the first time that foreigners have come to our country for exploration after the war. Strict regulations should be adopted, and negotiations on participation and cooperation should be based on the principle of mutual benefit and mutual respect. Our country now has outstanding talents in meteorology, geography, geology, zoology, botany, archaeology, and high-altitude surveying, who are capable of high-altitude exploration work. Therefore, we must not be as perfunctory as we were twenty years ago, resulting in being scolded and ridiculed by others, humiliating the national prestige, and violating our original intention of supporting scientific exploration. This is what we hope from the relevant scientific authorities in our country who are negotiating with the Reynolds expedition, to be cautious in handling matters and not to repeat the same mistakes!</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Formulate Measures for Using Real Estate to Offset Inheritance Tax, to be Implemented After Approval by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Ministry of Finance has already formulated provisional measures for using real estate to offset inheritance tax and will soon submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The contents of the measures are as follows: These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of the revised Inheritance Tax Law (hereinafter referred to as this Law). The ownership of real estate used to offset inheritance tax in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of this Law shall be transferred to the local government where the aforementioned real estate is located. When local governments accept the real estate prescribed in the preceding article, they shall pay 30% of the tax payable to the collecting agency. The 30% tax payable by the local government in the preceding paragraph may be deducted from the portion of the inheritance tax allocated by the central government to the local government. If the inheritance tax payable by the taxpayer is to be distributed to two or more counties, the local government that accepts the real estate used to offset the tax in full shall pay cash according to the amount to be distributed to that county. The cash to be paid in the preceding paragraph shall be deducted from the 70% of the tax to be allocated by the central government in the current year by the collecting agency according to the amount to be distributed. After local governments accept the real estate used to offset inheritance tax, its use shall be mainly for local education, culture, public welfare, and relief undertakings. The use shall be reported to the competent authorities at each level by the inheritance tax collecting agency for verification. After local governments accept the real estate used to offset inheritance tax, they shall promptly register the ownership of the property and shall not change it without approval. When indivisible or difficult-to-divide real estate is used to offset the tax, if its final appraised price exceeds the tax payable, the portion of the price exceeding the tax shall be paid by the local government that accepts the ownership to the taxpayer for receipt. After the inheritance tax taxpayer completes the procedures for using real estate to offset the tax, the inheritance tax collecting agency shall still issue an inheritance tax payment certificate, but it shall indicate the circumstances of the real estate offset for reference. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Peiping Held a Memorial Service Yesterday for Lu Yinglin and Li Mingding</h3>
<p>Chairman Inscribed a Eulogy "Heroic Spirit Lives On" [Our Peiping Dispatch on the 1st] Peiping held a memorial service today for the late Army Commander Lu Yinglin and the late Division Commander Li Mingding, who died in the Laishui battle. More than 200 eulogies and poems were sent from all sides. Chairman Chiang inscribed a eulogy "Heroic Spirit Lives On." Chen Cheng's eulogy read, "The setting sun illuminates the military gate, and the sacrifices and flags will be immortal; the great star sinks in the Ji wilderness, and the drums and trumpets of the generals have remaining grief." Fu Zuoyi's eulogy read, "The country raises soldiers, originally expecting them to serve on the battlefield, not hesitating to die calmly, generously becoming benevolent. The blue blood shows loyalty; ten thousand hardships are only one death. The Jise summons the soul, bearing to mourn the comrades-in-arms for many years, and feeling more pain in relying on the limbs, placing them as confidants. Dan Chen Zhaozu Dou, a thousand autumns of grandeur should be like life." The presiding officer was Xu Huidong, the speaker of the Peiping Municipal Council, and He Siyuan and Ding Shuijin and others were the attendees. The Director of the Executive Headquarters Li Zongren, and the Commander of the Suppression Headquarters Fu Zuoyi both attended and delivered speeches.

Speaker Xu and Director Li delivered speeches, stating that the deaths of Generals Lu and Li in the Laishui battle had created great achievements, consolidated the outer encirclement of Peiping and Tianjin, and reversed the war situation in North China. Their merits were great. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi said in his speech that the Laishui battle was the most important one among all the fronts of the Beining, Jinpu, and Ping Sui fronts that the Communist bandits launched when the suppression headquarters was established. The Communist bandits' goal was not achieved, and more than 40,000 people were annihilated, wounded, and killed, and more than 4,000 people were captured, and more than 3,000 guns were seized. Our army lost 1,100 people killed and 1,800 wounded. Two regiments of Lu's army and Li's division had four battalion commanders killed, one regimental commander, and one division commander. Fu continued: The families of the two generals lived in hardship, not as good as the primary school teachers in Peiping. Such sacrifice for the sake of doctrine, for the people, and for the country is truly inspiring and admirable. Fu called out, "Those who worship money and power in the city today should look at the soldiers fighting on the front lines and in the mountains." Fu also said: Although the Communist bandits have reached the end of their rope, it is necessary for every compatriot to do their best to defeat and annihilate their rebellious forces.</p>

<h3>Construction of Tanggu New Port Progressing Smoothly - Three-Year Project Plan Enters Second Year</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent] After the resumption of work at Tanggu New Port, the first achievement was the completion of the ship lock project, which the Japanese had completed 80% of, on December 15, 1946, and its opening to navigation was announced. Since then, passenger and cargo ships have continuously entered and exited Tianjin through the ship lock. From August to December 1947, it was temporarily closed for dredging the channel. During the eight-plus months of navigation, according to New Port statistics, a total of 1,143 ships passed through the ship lock, including 168 paying passenger and cargo ships, 35 free ships, and 940 passages by the port's own vessels. The total tonnage of the ships was 299,508 tons, and the total tonnage of cargo carried was 195,250 tons. This number is far from the ideal annual throughput of 6 million tons for the New Port, but it symbolizes the practical value of the ship lock.</p>
<p>Last Year's Project To complete the port construction project with an annual throughput of 6 million tons, New Port began its three-year plan in 1947. The first year's project has now been completed on schedule. The main projects include six items: Breakwater Project. This project is divided into three sub-items: 1. Rock dumping project: The original plan for the first year was to dump 150,000 tons of rock. Due to transportation difficulties and insufficient rock supply, the actual amount of rock dumped was 100,050 tons. 2. Adding concrete block project: This project involves adding concrete blocks weighing 22 tons each on top of the breakwater rocks to prevent erosion by seawater. A total of 90 blocks were added in 1947. 3. Adding concrete ring project: This project is similar to the concrete block project. Each ring weighs 13.5 tons, and a total of 28 rings were added in 1947. Dredging Project: The planned amount of dredging in 1947 was 2.8 million cubic meters. This work actually exceeded the planned amount, with a total of over 3 million cubic meters of mud dredged. The channel depth has now been dredged to 4 meters below the Dagu level, and the first and second wharves have been dredged to a depth of 6 meters. Dock Project: A dock with a length of 100 meters and a width of 11.6 meters has been completed. The bottom of the dock is 3.5 meters below the Dagu level, and the top of the dock is 4.7 meters above the Dagu level. Power Plant and Substation: One of each has been completed. 1,300 wooden piles ranging from 13 to 40 feet and 88 steel sheet piles ranging from 9 to 11 feet were driven for the construction of the plant and substation. 1,100 cubic meters of concrete foundation work was completed. The power plant now has two 2,000-kilowatt generators and has begun supplying power. Three wharf warehouses with an area of 3,000 square meters have been completed. 6.2 kilometers of railway have been built. In addition, the incidental projects for 1947 include: First, the repair of a coal loading machine that can load 300 tons of coal per hour. Second, the completion of three 650-foot water wells with a total water supply of 1.5 million gallons. Third, a total of 38 sunken ships were salvaged from the water.</p>
<p>This Year's Plan According to the New Port Engineering Bureau's work plan for the 1948 project, the important works are divided into seven items: Breakwater Project: It is planned to dump 300,000 tons of rock, extending the southern breakwater from its current 9.5 kilometers into the sea to 10.5 kilometers, and extending the northern breakwater from its current 7.9 kilometers into the sea to 10.5 kilometers. In this way, the southern breakwater is still 5.1 kilometers short of the planned total length of 16.8 kilometers, and the northern breakwater is 3.3 kilometers short of the planned total length of 13.8 kilometers. Dredging Project: The planned total amount of dredging is 6.5 million cubic meters. Among them, the channel depth will be deepened by 3.5 meters from the current 4 meters below the Dagu level, and the channel width will be expanded from the current 50 meters to 70 meters. The depth from the first wharf to the main channel will be dredged to 6 meters below the Dagu level, the depth from the second wharf to the main channel will be dredged to 8 meters, and a 9-meter deep water berth will be completed in the middle. In addition, the barge wharf will be dredged to a depth of 3 meters. Wharf Project: In addition to continuing the unfinished work on the first and second wharves, it is also decided to complete a barge wharf with a total length of 370 meters. In addition, a 200-meter long and 6-meter deep repair wharf will be built. Road Repair Project: Including adding 8 kilometers of railway and 37,000 square meters of highway. Warehouse and Factory Project: Including adding five 3,000-square-meter warehouses to the first wharf, adding a 2,000-kilowatt power plant, a carpentry factory, a foundry, a forge, and a shipyard each. Loading and Unloading Equipment: A floating crane with a lifting capacity of 150 tons, two cranes with a lifting capacity of 25 tons will be added, in addition to the construction of another coal loading machine that can load 300 tons per hour. Shipbuilding: It is decided to purchase a self-propelled dredger and a powerful icebreaker. Special attention is paid to the self-propelled dredger because the existing fixed dredgers are not suitable for dredging channels. In 1947, the ship lock was closed for four months due to channel dredging.</p>
<p>The Value of New Port The authorities' expectations for Tanggu New Port have made it a substitute port for the northern port in Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan. However, whether it is sufficient to undertake the task of the ideal northern port is a matter of opinion among Chinese and foreign experts, and they have different views. From the perspective of a certain period in the future, the Japanese have already laid a foundation for the construction of New Port, so continuing construction to completion and seeking its utilization is a relatively economical plan. However, port construction is a century-long plan, and New Port has many weaknesses. Li Shutian said: "Port construction should be viewed with a telescope, not with a microscope." Li is making a long-term calculation. He pointed out that the basic weaknesses of New Port are, first, that New Port is too far from the deep-water line, almost 40 li, while the Qinghe Estuary is only a few li from the deep-water line; secondly, New Port is a dead water bay, and the problem of winter freezing is particularly serious; and most importantly, dredging work will require a large amount of manpower and financial resources to maintain. Before the Hai River can be clarified, this work will inevitably be a heavy burden. However, with constant wars and national construction progressing like a snail, it would still be a great achievement if the New Port project could be completed on schedule.</p>

<h3>Attempt to Overthrow Nehru's Moderate Regime - Indian Extremist Conspiracy Exposed - Police to File Public Prosecution Against Godse Within a Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 1st Day] Police Headquarters announced that Godse, the murderer of Gandhi, could be publicly prosecuted for murder within the week. The police have also arrested five other suspects related to the case, including two of Godse's brothers.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 1st Day] Defense Minister Patel announced tonight that a dangerous plot to assassinate Nehru has been uncovered, and many people have been arrested. Patel and Education Minister Karan were also on the assassins' target list. However, he did not state whether Gandhi's recent assassination was part of this plot, only saying that the case is currently being tried in court, and it is not convenient to comment at this time, but there is no doubt that it was a conspiracy. Earlier, the police announced that the secretary-general of the Mahasabha, Tai Xi Pant, had been arrested, but the charges were not announced. The group is a militant Hindu organization whose aim is to make India a religious country. Its doctrines are based on ancient Indian law, and it propagates hatred of Islam in its ideology.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 31st Day] The New Delhi police authorities are investigating the assassination of Gandhi and have arrested fifteen people in Mumbai. They said that the assassination was part of a conspiracy to carry out exploratory actions near New Delhi. The fifteen people arrested are accused of being related to Godse, the assassin of Gandhi. Godse is a Hindu extremist and editor of the newspaper Vadna. According to the police, Godse admitted that he and five others conspired to assassinate Gandhi. The bombing of the Bela Temple on January 20 was also their responsibility. Godse said that after the bombing failed, they decided to assassinate Gandhi individually, the police believe that they came here from Mumbai's most reactionary Hindu district, Buna, carefully formulated a plan, first assassinated Gandhi, then assassinated Nehru and other moderates, and then assassinated Muslim leaders such as Mu Zha Na, in order to overthrow Nehru's moderate regime. The police said that the conspiracy was organized by members of the Mahayana Buddhist Society, a secret Indian organization, which attempts to drag India backwards and restore the Middle Ages. They advocate that Hindustan belongs to the Hindus, impose bloodshed or change of faith on Muslims, cancel Pakistan by force, and restore the ancient beliefs of Hinduism. The Mumbai police believe that the fifteen people arrested are directly related to the assassination. It is said that they drew lots to decide who would assassinate Gandhi. It is said that Godse is a madman in Mumbai. He edited an extremist newspaper in Buna, opposing Gandhi and the National Congress. [Agence France-Presse, Mumbai, 31st Day] It has long been heard that members of the Hindu Mahasabha Party are trying to assassinate all the important members of the Congress Party. It is reported that the Mumbai police have now found conclusive evidence and arrested five people. A thorough investigation is still in progress. Yesterday, when the crowd learned that the assassin of Gandhi was a member of the Mahasabha Party, their anger was directed at the party's organizations in Mumbai and Buna. The thugs in Buna attacked public buildings related to the party and planned to set them on fire. The police repeatedly tried to repel them with batons. The residence of the chairman of the Mahasabha Party and the residence of the assassin's brothers were destroyed by the thugs. There were accidental incidents such as shootings and knife wounds in Mumbai, and the situation here is still extremely tense this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Mumbai Situation Has Eased - Police Claim the City Has Returned to Normal - Arson and Looting Still Occurring in Buna</h3>
<p>[United Press, Mumbai, 1st Day] The police bureau claimed today that after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the violence in the city which lasted for twenty-four hours, has now returned to normal, street cars and buses, which were suspended for thirty-six hours, have resumed operation as usual this morning.

<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st Day] A large conflict occurred between crowds in northern Mumbai and supporters of the Indian Mahasabha (Hindu political group). Police suppressed the conflict, firing their guns ten times, resulting in widespread looting of shops, and five people injured. A large crowd in central Mumbai attempted to burn down the dormitories of Indian Volunteer Corps members, but were stopped by the police. The unrest in Buna has not ended, with arson and looting occurring frequently. The police have repeatedly opened fire, injuring more than 20 people, two of whom were shot. The homes of members of the Mahasabha and the Indian Volunteer Corps in Kolhapur, the capital of Kolhapur State, 160 kilometers south of Buna, have been robbed and burned, with losses amounting to tens of thousands of pounds. A thirty-six-hour lockdown has been announced since 10 p.m. A group of communists in Bezwada, Madras Province, clashed with members of the Indian military organization RSS, with some people injured and arrested.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Mumbai, 1st Day] Angry crowds continued to gather in northern Mumbai this morning, determined to destroy the homes of Indian Mahasabha leaders and sympathizers.

<h3>Nehru Speech - Criticizes Militants</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Amritsar, 31st Day] Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech to the people in Amritsar, the holy city of the Sikhs, today, criticizing militants. It is said: "The war and new events will destroy India's reputation in the international arena. Militants who want to seize power should also do so in a legitimate manner."</p>
<h3>Reforming the Congress Party - Gandhi's Pre-Death Plan - Advocate for Serving Farmers and People</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 1st Day] The draft plan for reforming the Congress Party, completed by Gandhi just hours before his assassination, is now in the custody of a Congress Party leader. Some of the opinions in the plan may be submitted for discussion at the next meeting of the Congress Party Working Committee. The full text is two pages long, and its content is very radical and revolutionary. Authoritative sources revealed that Gandhi also advocated that the Congress Party should be a national body organized by servants of the people, believing in the principle of non-violence. Although Gandhi did not oppose the dissolution of the existing Congress Party structure, when the new institution composed of servants of the people could inherit its position, the existing Congress Party should be composed of faithful followers serving India's 750,000 villages, with the sole purpose of serving the people. The people would form groups to elect leaders, and then the leaders would elect one all-India Congress Party leader. Gandhi insisted that comrades who faithfully serve the people must wear homespun cloth, abstain from alcohol, respect the sacredness and equality of all religions, and not discriminate against class, bloodline, or gender. They must also take improving rural culture, improving rural sanitation, and serving the rural areas as their purpose.</p>
<h3>India and Pakistan May Reconcile - Resolve the Kashmir Issue Themselves</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 31st Day] A spokesman for the Indian Embassy said that the Indian delegation participating in the Security Council's debate on the Kashmir issue may soon withdraw to New Delhi. This move is effectively equivalent to India withdrawing its protest regarding the Kashmir dispute from the Security Council's agenda, and at the same time, it shows India's willingness to seek a solution with Pakistan themselves. [United Press, Karachi, 31st Day] Pakistani government officials today joined the ranks of Hindus, watching the immersion ceremony held by Hindus on the beach, to show respect for Gandhi. At the same time, all of Pakistan is on alert to prevent riots that may be caused by Gandhi's assassination.</p>
<h3>U.S. Warships Dock in Italian Ports - Italian Approval Obtained - Italy Responds to Soviet Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 31st Day] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Italian government has ordered its ambassador to Moscow to inform the Soviet government that the visit of U.S. warships to Italian seaports had been approved by the Italian government in advance. The Soviet government had protested to the U.S. government last week regarding the U.S. warships' use of Italian ports. The Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that before the U.S. warships arrived in Italy for a visit, the Italian government had been contacted through diplomatic channels and obtained the permission of the Italian government. Naval ships from other countries are also welcomed by the Italian government to visit Italian ports. The spokesman also said that only the Italian government has the right to decide whether any protests are reasonable.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg and Connally Support European Aid Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 1st broadcast: Washington report, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee continued to hear opinions today. Senators Vandenberg and Connally unanimously expressed their support for the European Recovery Program. They attached particular importance to the second year of the implementation of the plan, believing that the success or failure of the entire plan depends on it. As for the first year, assistance should focus on "food, fuel, and fertilizer" to lay the foundation for recovery.</p>
<h3>Draft of the Five-Nation Western European Treaty; French Foreign Ministry Studying; Content Similar to Dunkirk Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] It is understood that the French Foreign Ministry is studying a draft treaty of alliance drafted by Britain, to be proposed individually by Britain and France to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Its content is very similar to the alliance treaty signed by Britain and France in Dunkirk. It is expected that France will not have major objections to this draft.</p>
<p>The next step will be for the French government to offer opinions on the draft proposed by the British government, and then draft a final version to be submitted to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg for study. Observers in London believe that until the content of the final draft is determined, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will not express further opinions than when they formally welcomed the Anglo-French proposal. Those familiar with the matter believe that the British proposal for a five-nation alliance treaty differs significantly from the Dunkirk treaty in one respect: the Anglo-French alliance treaty emphasizes mutual defense against future German aggression as its main characteristic, while the five-nation alliance treaty is less emphatic on this point. The reason is that the inclusion of West Germany within the scope of the Marshall Plan, and the possibility of West Germany eventually joining the Western European Union, must be carefully considered in the five-nation alliance treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Luxembourg, 1st] During a meeting of the foreign ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on the 1st, an agreement was reached on a "framework for economic posture," and a joint plan for Germany was agreed upon, marking a further step forward in the plan for a Western European alliance. The specific details of the economic posture were not specified in the meeting's communiqué.</p>
<h3>Soviet Suggestion to Cancel Four-Power Military Government in Austria</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] Radio Moscow broadcast today that Soviet General Verassov, commander of the Soviet occupation zone in Austria, suggested at the Allied Control Council that the four occupying powers unanimously abolish the military government, withdraw the military police, and grant greater powers to the government. Mr. Verassov suggested the following six points: Abolish civil administrative organs under the jurisdiction of the government and the military government. Transfer judicial power to Austrian courts, except in cases detrimental to the occupying powers. Abolish the military police organization, or at least limit the judicial power of the military police to crimes involving opposition to the Allied powers. Transfer urban traffic control to Austrian police. Before repatriation is completed, those awaiting repatriation should be managed by Austrian government law, and the Austrian government should be allowed to establish bilateral repatriation agreements with relevant governments. Transfer all radio stations controlled by the military government to Austrian hands without compensation.</p>
<h3>Deep-Sea Exploration Postponed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 1st] Professor Piccard and Mr. Coxins planned to conduct deep-sea tests in the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa, originally scheduled to dive to 14,000 feet below sea level. Professor Piccard told the United Press on the 1st that due to an accident involving the ship and the fact that the Gulf of Guinea has entered the storm season, the diving has been postponed indefinitely.</p>
<h3>French Free Exchange Market Scheduled to Open Today</h3>

The official opening of the market will be from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM. All transactions must be conducted in cash, and must be at least US$2,000 or 25,000 Escudos (Portuguese currency).</p>
<h3>Soviet Attempt to Establish Red Base in the Middle East; Large Numbers of Jews Migrate to Holy Land from Soviet-Controlled Areas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 31st] The secret news that about 20,000 Jews from the Soviet-controlled regions of Ukraine and the Balkans have migrated to Palestine since October of last year has now been partially revealed. Among them, 5,000 people each hold two official passports, one from the Balkans and the other an official passport issued by the Soviet Union. This secret news was revealed by the "Latest News" newspaper. The newspaper stated that this clearly shows the Soviet Union's extreme desire to gain a foothold in Palestine and establish a Red base in the Middle East.</p>
<h3>Huge New Soviet Budget; Military Spending Reaches 66 Billion Rubles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 31st] The Supreme Soviet held its fourth session in the Kremlin today, with Marshal Stalin personally in attendance. The marshal, wearing a gray military uniform, was in high spirits when he entered the hall, and all the deputies warmly applauded and welcomed him. Foreign Minister Molotov and key members of the Politburo were also present. When Finance Minister Shverev delivered his speech on this year's budget, he mentioned that "under the wise leadership of Marshal Stalin, the Soviet people are actively progressing towards communism," which triggered thunderous applause throughout the hall. Mr. Shverev subsequently reported that Soviet military spending this year decreased by 2.5 billion rubles compared to last year, totaling 66 billion rubles, accounting for 17% of the total budget. Spending on public health and education has increased sharply compared to last year. This year, there will be 33 million elementary school students and 722,000 middle school students nationwide, both exceeding the planned targets for 1950. Funding for health research has increased by 7% compared to last year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] The new Soviet budget announced by Moscow seems to indicate that the Soviet Union has exceeded the United States in military spending. However, it is believed that comparing the figures is of little significance because the relationship between the ruble and the dollar is very difficult to determine. If calculated at 5.3 rubles per dollar, Soviet military spending would reach $12.1886 billion. President Truman has proposed a defense budget of $11.025 billion for the current year starting July 3rd, which is about $2 billion less than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union estimates a surplus of $9 billion. Truman estimates a U.S. surplus of $487 million.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] A spokesman for the Jewish defense force Haganah said that another 400 to 500 Syrian Arabs, in 35 trucks, have entered Palestine from Syria to join Arab guerrilla forces. Many Palestinian Arab leaders are waiting to welcome them at the border. These troops are then dispersed into small groups and stationed near Nablus.</p>
<h3>General Cunningham Likely Dead; Search for Missing British Plane Underway</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hamilton, Bermuda, 31st] Thirty aircraft were dispatched today to expand the search for the missing British plane, which is feared to have crashed in the storm-swept Atlantic. The plane carried 29 people, including Air Marshal Cunningham.</p>
<h3>New Indonesian Cabinet Formed; Hatta Appointed Prime Minister; Sjahrir and Others Not Included</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 31st] Officials in Yogyakarta announced tonight that the new cabinet of the Republic of Indonesia has been formed. The new cabinet has a total of 16 members, with no leftists. Most of the important positions are held by members of the Islamic Party and the Nationalist Party. Former Prime Minister Sjahrir and Mr. Shariffuddin both declined to join the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Tokyo International Tribunal; Rebuttal Phase Ends; I Present Confidential Documents on Japanese Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] The rebuttal phase of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal ended this afternoon. The most confidential documents submitted to the court as evidence in the prosecution of Tojo and the other 24 major war criminals totaled more than 160. According to these documents, most of them are excerpts from the hotly debated and highly publicized Saionji diaries. These diaries are documents that reveal the inside news of some important Japanese political affairs to the world. Mr. Xiang Zhexun, the Chinese prosecutor, presented some confidential documents from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, proving Japan's crimes in China. Most of the documents were used to prove that Kenji Doihara and Seishiro Itagaki planned the "Manchurian Incident" and that they subsequently implemented heinous policies in controlling the three northeastern provinces. A secret document from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted by the Chinese prosecution team to the court stated that on August 7, 1937 (one week before August 13), the Japanese cabinet had decided to send a large army to Shanghai to begin hostile actions against China, placing Shanghai in the same situation as Japan's invasion of North China. The Chinese prosecutors also read out several resolutions from the meetings of the five Japanese cabinet ministers during the court hearing on the crimes committed by the defendants in North China. These records show that the Japanese government had formulated a secret policy to force President Chiang to step down and to place China under Japanese control.</p>
<h3>New Federation of Malaya Established; Singapore Workers Strike in Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 1st] Thirty thousand workers belonging to the British Commercial and Industrial Workers' Union, under the call of the communist-controlled General Federation of Trade Unions, went on strike today, bringing the port and urban transportation system to a standstill. This strike was in protest of the establishment of the new Federation of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. Many places throughout the city were decorated with left-wing "People's Flags" to mark this "day of grief." At the inauguration ceremony of the Federation of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, Gent, the former Governor of Malaya, formally took office as the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya. The Federation of Malaya is composed of the nine Malay states and the two colonies of Malacca and Penang. Singapore did not join the Federation of Malaya and remains a British Crown colony.</p>
<h3>Sacred Gandhi Ashes Entombment Ceremony; Gandhi's Relatives and Friends Barefoot Reciting Scriptures; Three-Hour Ceremony Moving</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 1st] Hindus today held prayers around the sacred ashes of Mahatma Gandhi on the banks of the sacred Jamuna River, and the ashes were then placed in a brick altar. According to Gandhi's sons, Davidas and Ramdas, it has yet to be decided whether to scatter the ashes in the Jamuna River or the Ganges, or to keep a portion. Indian industrialist Bolar stated that he has decided to donate the Bolar Mansion, where Gandhi was assassinated, to the nation, and its use will be decided by Indian leaders. The entire ceremony of entombing Gandhi's ashes lasted three hours and was held inside a barbed wire fence set up by the military. The scene was moving and in stark contrast to the chaotic order of yesterday's cremation ceremony. Inside the barbed wire were Gandhi's relatives and friends, all barefoot, reciting Hindu and Islamic scriptures and singing Christian hymns, while the audience was outside the wire. The brick altar was decorated with flowers, and relatives and friends formed a circle, walking slowly around the cremation pyre three times, finally kneeling in front of the pyre, with some people touching their foreheads with ashes, symbolizing that the Mahatma had left the mortal world.</p>

<h3>Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance</h3>
<p>— Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The True Arguments Finally Convinced the President</p>
<p>The greatest threat to trade agreements did not come from foreign countries, nor from the Republican Party, nor from certain manufacturers or planters, but from within the Roosevelt administration itself, represented by George N. Peek, former director of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration.</p>
<p>In March 1934, the President appointed him as a foreign trade advisor. If Mr. Roosevelt had hit me in the face with a sledgehammer, I don't think I would have been more stunned than by this appointment. Just as a person, Peek was the most affable and likeable. He was very loyal to his views and never let go once he held them. But I believed that his economic views were unsound. If they were to replace the sound economic policies upon which our trade agreements were based, it would inevitably lead to the most profound tragedy. His efforts, and those of his colleagues, sometimes with the President's assistance, almost crowded out my entire international economic policy and implementation plan. I wanted to promote these policies and plans throughout the world in order to improve economic prosperity and peace.</p>
<p>Peek often brought whole baskets of statistics to the White House, and the President supported his statements to the press. He gave the President a memorandum urging him to hand over the power to manage all foreign trade policies and negotiations to him. If this were done, he would deprive the State Department and the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, and Finance of any real say in any aspect of foreign trade. Fortunately, I was able to prevent this development.</p>
<p>Then, Peek went to negotiate barter agreements with foreign countries—a method that Europe was using, and which we hoped to eliminate through trade agreements based on the principle of equal treatment. His starting point was undoubtedly sincere, because there were indeed surplus American goods at the time that had to be disposed of abroad. But he completely failed to see that such barter agreements could not coexist with trade agreements.</p>
<p>The Trade Agreements Act was aimed at broad policies and broad trade methods, not at individual barter transactions. A basic point of our trade agreement policy—that is, equality of commercial treatment and opposition to all kinds of discrimination and preferences—would be openly undermined by Peek's barter proposal. Our plan was to broadly provide export facilities, especially for these surplus items such as cotton, tobacco, lard, wheat, and automobiles, by reducing foreign discrimination and preferences and promoting equal trade treatment. In my opinion, maintaining this policy around the world was extremely important.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer of 1943, my colleagues at the State Department and I spent a great deal of time refuting Peek's theories. The contradiction reached its peak in November and December 1934, when Peek negotiated a barter agreement with Germany. On the one hand, Germany openly delayed the payment of $2 billion in debt to the United States that had already matured, thus maintaining the worst credit with American creditors, while on the other hand, it pretended to want to establish a fair trade agreement with us. At the same time, it tried to appease other countries by temporarily repaying its debts and trade arrears.</p>
<p>Hitler's economic magician sent a delegation to the United States, and Peek negotiated an agreement with them. This agreement had all the standard characteristics of Hitler's way of dealing with people, just as Hitler and Schacht grabbed other countries by the throat and forced them to accept it. We should sell 800,000 bales of cotton to Germany through the Export-Import Bank, and Germany would pay the Export-Import Bank in US dollars for a quarter of the total price. As for the remaining three-quarters, it would be paid in German currency, plus interest of 22.5%. The Export-Import Bank could sell this currency to American importers who purchased German goods at a discount in order to pay for these goods.</p>
<p>While this transaction was being negotiated, I argued against it with the President to the best of my ability. I felt that the President's interest in foreign trade policy was much less than it had been before he ran for and was elected President. After he devoted himself to studying domestic reforms, he had very little time to study international economic relations. From my contact with him, I didn't believe he was paying close attention to foreign economic relations.</p>
<p>On November 19, I received an informal notice from him saying:</p>
<p>"As with most of the problems that you and I have dealt with over the years, there are always two sides to the argument. In purely theoretical terms, you and I agree, but sometimes we have to modify a principle in order to deal with a rigid and helpless fact! Look at the large amount of Japanese cotton cloth that has flooded into the Philippines in the past six months." "I think it would be very helpful in many ways if you and Peek, who sees trade issues from an extremely practical point of view, could spend an hour or two one evening discussing the issue of the most-favored-nation clause."</p>
<p>In all practical terms, this method was tantamount to asking me to invite Peek and, in effect, abandon my plan and let him replace me in economic leadership. I was thoroughly convinced that the President and Peek were wrong about this extremely important issue. There is no room for compromise on the point of equal treatment. Either you get equality, or you get inequality. You cannot make both work at the same time. The Trade Agreements Act established the principle of equal treatment for trade agreements. If this principle were amended, then the "rigid and helpless facts" that the President mentioned would become even more rigid and helpless.</p>
<p>I did invite Peek. But, as I had fully expected, our conversation about his proposals was completely unproductive. On November 28, 1934, I wrote a letter to the President in Warm Springs, Georgia, and sent him three memoranda on commercial policy. I said, "To the best of my knowledge, all government departments are in complete harmony with the views expressed herein, with the exception of our friend Peek. The press, in general, is supportive of us, as I told you on the train."</p>
<p>A few days later, I left Washington for Nashville, Tennessee, to prepare to give a speech on agriculture and trade agreements. When I returned to Washington, my assistant, McBerrett, met me in Charlottesville, Virginia, and brought an urgent letter issued by Undersecretary of State Philipp on December 13. The letter began: "In the past two days, a change has occurred with an unexpected abruptness, and I know that this change must be very difficult for you." He reiterated the facts, saying that Peek and the President had a meeting on December 12, after which the White House notified the State Department that the President had approved the barter agreement negotiated with Germany. Philipp telephoned the White House and obtained a guarantee from the President that no final decision would be made until I returned.</p>
<p>As soon as I returned to the State Department, my colleagues and I immediately gathered the arguments against bartering with Germany, which I presented to the President. I told him that our trade agreement plan would be in serious danger. We are currently negotiating an agreement with Brazil, and we have now received a protest from Brazil. Brazil is also a cotton exporter, and it said that if we concluded this preferential agreement with Germany, it would be forced to take the same measures and delay signing an agreement with us.</p>
<p>I pointed out that this transaction was equivalent to subsidizing German imports into the United States. By selling German currency to importers who purchased German goods at a discount and allowing them to use it to pay for imported German goods, they could obtain goods from Germany at a lower price than they could obtain the same goods from other countries.</p>
<p>This transaction stipulated that the mark should be converted into US dollars according to the old gold standard exchange rate, thus overturning the devaluation of the US dollar, at least as far as Germany was concerned.</p>
<p>I said that our cotton exporters might not actually be able to obtain US dollar foreign exchange by selling goods to Germany. There was no guarantee that they would not be forced to sell cotton at a loss. The US government may suffer other losses through the Export-Import Bank.</p>
<p>I also said that the barter method was based on Peek's belief that we had no other way to sell cotton to Germany. In reality, the opposite was true. I felt that Germany needed cotton so much that it would buy at least 500,000 bales and would try to find US dollar foreign exchange to pay for them.</p>
<p>In addition to the details of all these arguments, there was one fact that was particularly important, and that was that this transaction was discriminatory rather than based on equal treatment. Every type of goods that Germany exported to the United States therefore gained a special benefit, and every country that exported this type of product to the United States would inevitably protest and possibly take retaliatory measures. The Chilean ambassador told us that if German fertilizer had preferential treatment in our market, as stipulated in this agreement, then Chile would be forced to dump nitrates here.</p>
<p>I said: "This transaction is extremely discriminatory against Americans, but it is an extremely good barter deal for Germany; the United States gains very little and takes great risks... The proposed plan will almost certainly arouse extreme hatred among most Americans who strongly oppose the Hitler regime."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the President saw the truth of these arguments. He withdrew his approval of Peek's deal. This also marked the end of Peek's attempts to negotiate similar transactions with other countries. From then on, the new proposals contained in the trade agreement principles and plans constantly weakened Peek's plan, eventually crushing it. I kept explaining the soundness of our plan to the President, especially the extreme necessity of equal treatment. In a memorandum to the President on February 15, 1935, I said: "Our country can adopt the old methods with other countries, limiting its trade activities to an extremely narrow scope, only doing some barter and bilateral trade transactions, but it is clear that in the past few years, our exports have increased by 450 million US dollars, while all European countries, using this narrow barter agreement and bilateral trade treaty with hundreds of methods and measures to increase exports, have only gained so much. Understanding this, we cannot do this."</p>
<p>I pointed out to Mr. Roosevelt that our first step was to eliminate or reduce excessive tax rates, including those that completely or virtually eliminated competition, or those that had been in place for a considerable period of time and had not resulted in domestic production being able to satisfy more than 10% to 15% of total domestic consumption. At the same time, tax rates applicable to extremely ineffective commercial or industrial goods, or to various kinds of fancy goods, luxury goods, semi-luxury goods, things that are substantially different from domestic products, or commodities that are different in use, should be eliminated or reduced as long as they do not cause serious competition with American products.</p>
<p>Two months later, Peek's office was abolished. The trade agreement was saved, and the subsequent results fully proved that our opposition to Peek's ideas was well-founded.</p>

<h3>Suspected of Detaining Dancers and Employees, Interrogated Overnight, Released on Bail in Batches; Sun Hongyuan and 107 Others Escorted to General Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The second day after the dance industry crowd vandalized the Social Bureau, the police bureau announced that 642 men and women were arrested on the spot the previous day. Subsequently, more than a hundred suspected individuals were arrested, totaling 797 people, who were detained separately in various branch bureaus. Starting at 2:00 PM yesterday, the police bureau, after obtaining approval from the mayor, transferred 107 men and women who were identified with evidence to the General Bureau for strict interrogation. The rest were interrogated overnight, recorded their statements, and then released on bail in batches. All dance halls were closed for business on the previous two days, with deserted entrances. Weekend and holiday dance patrons felt greatly at a loss, and some even went to inquire about the whereabouts of the dancers. The families of the arrested dancers and employees brought clothes to various police bureaus to visit and deliver supplies yesterday. Some gathered in the dance halls to discuss and inquire about news. They were overjoyed to learn late at night about the news of early release after interrogation. As for the 797 arrested dancers and employees, 91 were detained in the Songshan Branch Bureau, including 71 dancers and 20 employees. 205 were at the Penglai Branch Bureau, including 50 dancers and 155 employees. 27 dancers were at the Jiangning Branch Bureau. 106 employees were at the Huangpu Branch Bureau. 110 employees were at the Lujiawan Branch Bureau. 41 employees were at the Jing'an Branch Bureau. 30 employees were at the Xincheng Branch Bureau. 96 employees were at the Laozha Branch Bureau. Employees were at the Tilanqiao Branch Bureau. 30 employees were at the Changshu Branch Bureau. 43 employees were at the Ninth Branch Bureau. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the police bureau, together with staff from the Social Bureau, motorcycle team members, Flying Fortress team members, security police general team police officers, and transferred personnel from the Songshan Branch Bureau, went to various branch bureaus to identify nearly a hundred suspected individuals. This group of suspected individuals, along with Sun Hongyuan, chairman of the Dance Industry Association, Tang Zongjie, chief executive of the Workers' Union, Hu Haiyuan, executive, and He Hai of the Musicians Association, a total of 107 people, were escorted to the General Bureau at 7:30 PM. Formal strict interrogation is scheduled to begin today. In the future, depending on the severity of the circumstances, they will be sent to the District Attorney's Office or the Garrison Command. Apart from the 107 people, the rest were interrogated overnight, with the Mayor's approval from Director Yu, recording their statements and then releasing them on bail successively. It is expected that all will be released by this morning.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Resume Business Today</h3>
<p>It is heard that in addition to having retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to continue filing an appeal with the Executive Yuan according to law, the Dance Industry Association is also trying every means to bail out Sun Hongyuan and other relevant personnel. Meanwhile, they are preparing to resume business today.</p>
<p>The dancers, employees, and police officers who were injured in the confusion the night before were sent to Nanyang and Guangci Hospitals for emergency treatment. Some left after brief treatment, while those with more serious injuries were transferred to the Police Hospital that night. Yesterday, many dance patrons brought flowers and fruit to Nanyang Guangci to visit, but learned that the dancers had already left, and they returned disappointed.</p>
<p>Mayor and Bureau Director Send Representatives to Console Injured Police Officers</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] When the dancers and employees vandalized the Social Bureau the day before, Song Tingjun, the chief of the Songshan Police Branch Bureau, and dozens of police officers were injured while maintaining order on the scene. Mayor Wu specially sent the chief of the Public Relations Section to express condolences yesterday. Yuan Wenzhang, director of the Fourth Division of the Social Bureau, and Shen Xingfan, director of the Personnel Office, also represented Director Wu and went to the Police Hospital at 11:00 AM yesterday to console Lu Bolang, the squad leader of the motorcycle team, Wei Liankui, number 5192, Feng Ruoyu of the Flying Fortress, number 5953, Li Qing of the Motor Vehicle Team, number 5054, Liu Yunting, number 5293, and Xiong Weichao, the section chief of the First Section of the Songshan Branch Bureau, who was recuperating at home. Each person was given a consolation money of one million yuan and candies. In addition, it is planned to give bonuses, but the amount has not yet been determined. Among them, Director Xiong suffered internal injuries, so Director Yuan specially went to Director Wu's private residence to obtain Yunnan Baiyao as a gift.</p>
<p>The Mastermind of Vandalizing the Social Bureau, Chairman Fang, to be Severely Punished</p>
<p>City Party Headquarters Chairman Fang, regarding the petition and vandalism of the Social Bureau by dance hall employees and dancers, issued a statement saying: "Director Wu of the Social Bureau has repeatedly petitioned in Nanjing for the ban on dancing. His care for colleagues in the dance industry and his efforts to seek a compromise are obvious to all. Now, the petition is not based on proper action, but openly vandalizes government agencies, insults officials, disregards the government, and is utterly lawless. We are certain that the several incidents that have occurred in Shanghai recently were premeditated by ambitious elements. Therefore, in each action, unidentified elements participated. The disturbances at Tongji University were the same, and the vandalism of the Social Bureau was the same. The slogans and banners are bizarre and reactionary to the extreme. This is definitely not what rational dance hall employees and dancers who are trying to solve their livelihood would do. These large numbers of traitors hidden in Shanghai, the scourge of the people, will not be removed for a single day, and Shanghai society will not be peaceful for a single day. We deeply hope that the military and political authorities will deal with this matter strictly, thoroughly investigate the masterminds, bring them to justice, and punish them with the most severe penalties so that the demons will be exposed and the evil winds will be eradicated. Then the citizens will be fortunate. As for the dancers' transfer to other professions, I will do my best to serve the people and discuss the aftermath with the authorities."</p>
<p>Commander Xuan Issues a Statement Resolving to Suppress Violence and Evil Trends</p>
<p>Shanghai has experienced two major shocking events within 48 hours: the transformation of the Tongji student unrest into violence against Mayor Wu on January 29, and the vandalism of the Social Bureau by more than 3,000 petitioning dancers and dance hall employees on January 31, which deeply grieved the security authorities. Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu told a Central News Agency reporter one day that this kind of evil trend is just beginning and must be strictly suppressed to deter others from following suit. The leaders of the past two incidents will be severely punished, and the masterminds behind them must be investigated and never let go. When the reporter asked Xuan about the disposition of the three responsible persons of the dance industry groups who were arrested in the vandalism of the Social Bureau, he replied that Sun Hongyuan, chairman of the Dance Hall Owners Association, Yong Zongjie, chairman of the Dance Hall Workers Union, and Xiang Yunyuan, director, are currently being thoroughly interrogated by the police bureau. Both labor and management participated in the crowd petitioning the Social Bureau, resulting in the act of vandalism. They are the responsible persons of both labor and management, and of course, they should be held responsible. However, what resolutions they made during the meeting, what their original intention was in going to the Social Bureau, and whether they intended to vandalize the Social Bureau are all important keys to determining the severity of their crimes.</p>
<h3>Dance Halls Not Immediately Banned; Still to be Eliminated in Two Phases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Director Wu, after working tirelessly day and night, felt quite exhausted in spirit. He told reporters last night that no instructions have yet been received from the central government regarding the handling of this matter. The dance ban issue will still be based on the original plan to eliminate dance halls in phases and will not be immediately banned because of the dance industry's inappropriate actions yesterday. As for the extent of the damage to the Social Bureau, it is currently impossible to estimate, but the details have been reported to the municipal government for verification.</p>
<h3>Jin Meihong's Mother Cries and闹s at the Association, Using This Newspaper as Evidence to Plead for Her Daughter's Injustice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jin Meihong, one of the dancer representatives, was arrested the night before and is temporarily detained at the Songshan Branch Bureau. Her mother cried and闹ed at the Dance Industry Association yesterday, and showed people the photo published in this newspaper, saying: "She clearly waved her hand in the photo to stop others from vandalizing, how can you say she participated in the leadership?" It is heard that Jin also denied participating in the vandalism during the interrogation. Most of the dancers in custody cried bitterly all day yesterday, all saying they were forced to participate and regretting being imprisoned, thinking of their families having no means of support, and feeling remorseful.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau in Ruins After Looting; Broken Chairs and Tables Piled in Corners, Employees Resentfully Clean Up the Remnants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Although yesterday was Sunday, staff from all departments of the vandalized Social Bureau still went to the bureau to work, engaging in arduous "aftermath" work. The main iron gate on Linsen Middle Road was closed, and passersby stopped to look at the damaged building, casting concerned glances. Inside the bureau, staff from all departments, under the supervision of Director Wu, Deputy Director Li, and various section chiefs, helped the workers clean up the broken and chaotic scene. The windows of the rooms that were broken into and vandalized were pierced with holes and temporarily covered with wooden boards and paper to avoid the cold wind. Broken and incomplete tables and chairs were piled in every corner, or documents and pieces of paper that had been torn up and thrown away. It was not until late at night that some order was achieved. However, there was a shortage of desks and chairs in each office, so today they can only make do and prepare to piece together long tables for dining to use as offices. Sundries and utensils will be gradually added and replenished.</p>
<p>The losses in each room, in addition to tables, chairs, utensils, and sundries, included the city-wide business registration cards of the Industrial and Commercial Registration Section of the First Division, which were overturned on the ground. Fortunately, they could still be collected and sorted out without much loss. However, the documents, books, and receipts in the Grain Section were all torn up, including important documents such as the data for the implementation of the comprehensive grain allocation, the rice allocation roster, the government's sales of rice accounts, and relevant grain statistics. Working staff felt annoyed trying to find and sort through the piles of paper on the ground one by one. In addition to resentment, they hated the vandals with a passion.</p>
<h3>Personal Belongings and Salaries Also Missing</h3>
<p>In addition to public property, many employees' personal belongings were also lost in each room. Among them, the five-part form for the in-kind allocation to public school employees and the salaries that had just been issued not long ago were often placed in drawers or under glass tops, and were all reported missing amidst the chaos. Deputy Director Li's American wool hat and fountain pen, which he had placed in his office because he was attending a labor-management evaluation meeting in the conference room, and the travel expenses issued for the labor-management evaluation were also lost.</p>
<p>The bureau specially notified all divisions and sections yesterday that all kinds of certificates, such as flags and armbands, left behind when the dancers and employees vandalized on January 31, should be submitted to the document section immediately for filing and handling. If anyone can identify names and faces, please report them as well.</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor Huang Personally Comes to Inspect</h3>
<p>Huang Liang, the chief prosecutor of the District Attorney's Office, personally went to the Social Bureau at around 10:00 AM yesterday to inspect the damage. Staff from the bureau accompanied him to inspect the vandalized rooms and reported on the situation at that time.</p>
<h3>Leaders from All Walks of Life Send Condolences</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the incident of dancers petitioning and vandalizing the Social Bureau the day before, Hong Lanyou was specially sent by the central government to express condolences to Director Wu yesterday. Leaders from all walks of life in the city, such as Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilu, Wu Shaoshu, Yang Guanbei, Chen Baotai, and Cao Jun, also went to Director Wu's private residence one after another to express condolences.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs was greatly angered upon learning that the dance hall employees and dancers in the city had vandalized the Social Bureau. He specially made a long-distance phone call from Nanjing yesterday to express condolences to Director Wu of the Social Bureau.</p>
<h3>Using Petition as an Excuse to Carry Out Riots; The Social Bureau Orders the Dissolution of Three Dance Industry Organizations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the dancers and dance hall employees vandalized the bureau during the petition, Director Wu believed that their actions were extreme and illegal, and decided to order the dissolution of the Shanghai Dance Hall Business Association, the Dance Hall Workers' Professional Union, and the Professional Musicians Association, ordering them to cease activities immediately. The police bureau will dispatch police to execute the order, and request a strict investigation. The dissolution order will be issued today. In addition to reporting to Mayor Wu and Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, it will also be sent to the City Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union for notification. The text of the order is as follows: "It is found that the association used the excuse of a petition to lead members to gather at this bureau on January 31 of this year to carry out riots, vandalizing public property, obstructing official duties, and disrupting social order, which is extremely inappropriate. According to Article 18, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the People's Organization Law During the Extraordinary Period, it should be dissolved, and personnel will be sent to reorganize it. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Police Bureau to execute this order, it is hereby ordered to comply without delay."</p>
<h3>A List of Material Losses Totalling 500 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is still impossible to calculate the losses from the vandalism of the Social Bureau. Apart from documents, material losses are estimated at around 500 million. A preliminary list of damaged items includes two Ford cars, one Thor truck, seven bicycles, 19 armchairs, 119 single chairs, three double sofas, nine desks, 59 light bulbs, four electric clocks, one glass stationery tray, 26 thermos bottles, 26 spittoons, three square tables, two leather chairs, three file cabinets, three glass mirror frames, 135 teacups, 13 call bells, 20 ashtrays, five tablecloths, six glass fruit plates, 31 inkwells, three vases, two flower bowls, six steel window curtains, 13 table lamps, 18 telephones, 74 glass plates, 18 memo boards, two flowerpot stands, three small tables, one small alarm clock, one sand filter, 74 inkpads, 57 printing tables, 35 abacuses, 36 metal rulers, 16 staplers, 59 water bowls, 39 inkstones, 39 inksticks, one large glass cabinet, one glass bulletin board, four card boxes, two bulletin boards, two index boxes, two round tables, one scale, one leather swivel chair, 10 key boxes, two coat racks, four double reclining chairs, four long cabinets, three broken sofas, six hanging electric fans, seven square stools, two wall clocks, four steel plates, three mimeograph machines, four glass document cabinets, five Chinese typewriters, two Western typewriters, one wooden chair, seven typewriter desks, three four-person writing desks, two long tables, one letter sealing machine, 10 swivel chairs, seven hole punchers, eight wooden reclining chairs, one steel window curtain rod, six lead buckets, eight coffee tables, 10 single sofas, 22 double writing desks, 37 single writing desks, one steel document cabinet, one twelve-drawer document cabinet, 15 pen holders, six ink boxes, two four-door large wooden cabinets, two ash trays, three wash basins, four tea trays, one blackboard, one small writing desk, five screens, and one wardrobe.</p>

<h3>Fire on East Changzhi Road Destroys One Shop</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yuchang Pot and Porcelain Shop, a three-story building at numbers 938 to 940 Changzhi Road, was accidentally set on fire at approximately 7:45 PM yesterday. Flames pierced the roof. The Fire Department rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It was extinguished after about an hour. One room on the third floor was destroyed, resulting in significant losses. The fire starter was taken by police to the Tilanqiao Police Branch for questioning about the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3>Careless Accident on Cargo Ship in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Yunhe wooden motor cargo ship, docked near the Yongan Yarn Factory in the Huangpu River, caught fire at 7:00 PM last night. The Jianghai Customs Protection Ning fire boat rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was put out after two hours. The entire ship's equipment was completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Students in Shanghai Escaping from Communist Areas Publicize the Atrocities of the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Student Propaganda Brigade is organized by middle and high school students who have escaped from the Communist-controlled areas. Having personally experienced the suffering of being ravaged by the Communist bandits, they will publicize the facts of the Communist bandits' atrocities to society to raise the vigilance of people in the rear. The brigade members, numbering more than 90, set out for the first time yesterday morning to carry out propaganda in various districts of the city. They spoke with tears in their eyes when promoting their cause in various theaters and dance halls, which moved the audience. Everyone shouted slogans to exterminate the Communist bandits, and the atmosphere was extremely tense.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Propaganda Brigade Bravely Promotes Propaganda in Disguise in the Rain</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Propaganda Work Brigade of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang has been actively carrying out propaganda work for suppressing rebellion and building the nation, and has been quite busy. The brigade held its second members' meeting at Yucai Middle School yesterday morning, attended by more than a hundred members. Director Tan presided over the meeting. In addition to reviewing the work of each district team, there was a detailed discussion on the future work. After the meeting, all the brigade members braved the rain and went to Longhua, Caohejing, and the Southern District to carry out propaganda in disguise. More than a thousand spectators attended, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Shrinking in Small Sheds, Hundreds of Thousands of Poor Compatriots are Wrestling with Death; Packages of Dead Children are Found from Time to Time in Secluded Alleyways</p>
<p>The poor compatriots in Shanghai who live in shantytowns can be roughly divided into five districts: South Shanghai, West Shanghai, North Shanghai, East Shanghai, and Pudong.</p>
<p>Looking at the map of Shanghai, in South Shanghai, starting from Dadongmen to the south, the shantytown area begins from Mietu Street and Kuaitu Alley behind Xiao Jiu Hua Street. Further south to Wangjia Wharf of the Penglai District Office, the southwest Nancang Street, Zhangjia Alley, Qinglong Bridge Street, Gongguan Street, Duojia Road, and other places are all there. Further south, along both sides of Lujiabang Road, from Waima Road through Lima Road, Caodui, Chihetou, Haichao Road, Kualong Road, to Puyu East and West Roads, the middle of this area is all dirty and crowded shantytowns. Then, from the Hu Min Nan Zha Road to the northwest to Hualang Road, not even reaching the Jinren Road to the south and to the Zhizaoju Road to the west, this small square block also houses many people struggling in the mud.</p>
<p>Unimaginably Bad</p>
<p>Further west into the Songshan District, north starting from Xie Xu Road, and south also reaching the wilderness and not even reaching the Zhenren Road, in this block, except for the northeast and the middle, which are not very large, the rest are densely packed, with Luban Road Yu She Li, Jumen Road Yuan Song Village, Xie Tu Road Lane 83, Lane 275, and No. 245 Xieqiao Road next to the most.</p>
<p>In the Lujiawan District, the north also reaches Xie Xu Road as the boundary, and the south is the same. After passing Dapu Road to the west, it is not very concentrated. Only around the Pingyin Bridge at the intersection of Rihui Road and Xie Tu Road is it slightly denser, with Luban Road Xiangda Li, both sides of Dingxiang Zen Temple on Xie Xu Road, Xie Tu Road, and Dapu Road being the most. The shantytowns at the intersection of Luban Road and Xie Xu Road and the shantytowns at the intersection of Luban Road and Liyuan Road can be said to be the worst shantytowns in Shanghai, simply unimaginably bad. Shantytowns are relatively sparse in the Changshu District to the west.</p>
<p>The distribution of shantytowns in South Shanghai is like a small pocketknife lying horizontally, long from east to west and short from north to south. The north is roughly bounded by the river on Xujiahui Road, and the south reaches the open countryside. Most of the coolies do odd jobs, with a total of about 15,000 households and more than 80,000 people.</p>
<p>Dirty, Chaotic, and Poor</p>
<p>Further west, there are only some scattered shantytowns along the river on Xujiahui Road. After passing Xujiahui, from Xuzhen Road to the west, at the place where it is about to meet Ciyou Road, it is called Pingmin Village, where there are many shantytowns. Further west and then turning northeast, the sides of Hongqiao all the way to the radio station on Hongqiao Road are all straw sheds. From Fan Yu Road to the north, from the Shanghai West Railway Station along Changde Road to Jiangsu Road, around Zhongshan Park, such as West New Street, Sujiajiao, North and South Pig Bristle Factories, Lu Xuezhai, Yaojiajiao, and Sunjiazhai are also where they gather.</p>
<p>Entering the Jiangwan District to the northeast, the Jiangwan District is a very concentrated area of shantytowns. West of Jiaozhou Road is all a mix of small and medium-sized factories and shantytowns. To the south are Taiping Li on the west side of Fanhuangdu, and Jinjia Xiang on the north side, Kangjia Bridge on Yanping Road. To the north, from Yuyao Road to the east, almost every alley has straw sheds. The large areas with large populations include North Yao, Lane 681, Lane 641, Lane 607, Lane 501, Lane 488, Lane 487, Lane 468, Lane 467, and Gonghe Li. South to Kangding Jiang, Fanwangdu Road, and north to Changshou Road and Anyuan Road, the area is very large, dirty, chaotic, and poor.</p>
<p>Dense Zhabei Area</p>
<p>The Putuo District has fewer shantytowns. Apart from Lane 624 on Anyuan Road, and Yaoshui Alley and Caoxiebang at the end of West Kang Road, concentrated straw sheds are rare, while the rest are very scattered. In addition, some residents in ordinary tile houses, although better than straw sheds, still live below the poverty line, such as Xinglongfang, Meifangli, North and South Yinghuali, and Tokyo Li on Tokyo Road in Changshou Road. The West Shanghai District roughly has about 15,000 households.</p>
<p>The Zhabei area is also very dense, generally referred to as "Hamabei." The ground in this shantytown area is very large, reaching Qingyun Road in the suburbs to the north, the area near the Hu Tai long-distance bus road to the west, the railway to the south, and Zhiyuan Road to the east, and is concentrated. In the areas of Zhongxing Road, Yongxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Taiyangmiao Road, Jiaotong Road, Jingjiang Road, and Datong Road, it is almost impossible to find a small Western-style house, or even ordinary tile houses are rare. The land is wide, and the people are dense. There are also many in the Xinjiang Road and Gonghe Road areas south of the railway, totaling nearly 8,000 households and about 50,000 people.</p>
<p>Not Many in the North Sichuan Road District</p>
<p>There are not too many shantytowns in the North Sichuan Road District, but they are all concentrated in the Xiangyan Bridge area. North to Quanjiaan Road, west to Qimei Road and Liyang Road, south to Tianai Road, and east to the river. They are all in this area. They can be seen from any alley. In addition, north from Qimei Road, on the west side of Qimei Road and near the Qimei Road Bridge, there are also many.</p>
<p>Extra in the Tilanqiao District</p>
<p>Past Xiangyan Bridge is the shantytown of the Tilanqiao District. This is also very concentrated. The west reaches the river, the northeast is bounded by Sharong Road, and the southeast is bounded by Yuezhou Road and Wuzhou Road. In this triangular area, all the lanes on roads such as Sharong Road, Hongzhen Street, Linping Road, Wuhua Road, Kulun Road, Tongzhou Road, Tianbao Road, Zhangjia Xiang Road, Hailar Road, Ruyi Road, and Gaoyang Road are also crowded together. In the Yulin District and the Yangshupu District, they are scattered in blocks. East from Zhoujiazui Road, at the place where it meets Tangshan Road, there are several small blocks here. There is a large block in Lane 536 on Liaoyang Road. South across Kunming Road is another large block. Further south, there is a block at the intersection of Huoshan Road and Tongbei Road. West on Huoshan Road, before reaching Jingzhou Road, is another large block. Continuing south, both sides of Fulu Road, Lane 75 Longjiang Road, opposite Lane 163, Xiaomuqiao, in front of the Zhongfang No. 1 Factory on Qiqihar Road, opposite and on the right side of the Zhongfang No. 16 Factory, at the intersection of Lanzhou Road and Jianlin Road, and at the intersection of Changyang Road and Kunming Road on Qiqihar Road, and Gaolangqiao North, each location has more than three or four hundred households.</p>
<p>There are many factories and wharves in this area, so there are also many shantytowns, totaling about 20,000 households and more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Their Innocence</p>
<p>Across the river from Yangshupu, along Pudong to the west, there are only some scattered shantytowns on both sides, such as Maqiaohang Road, Yangjing Port, Jiajiaqiao, the intersection of Minsheng Road, Zhaopu Road, and Yaojiazhai. Some are very bad, and some are okay. The number of households is not too many. Turning from Yangjiazhai to the Pudong South Road to the south, there are about a hundred households near Xiaoshi Bridge and Pushan Villa. From the police bureau road to the southeast, east to Pudong South Road, west to the wharves and warehouses on the Huangpu River, and south to Xiejiazhai, Pudong Electric Company.</p>
<p>In this area, except for the two gaps of Lujiabo and Xiejiazhai, the rest are very dense. Such as near the Lingxiu Elementary School on Pudong South Road, Yangjiabo, Yujiamiao, before and after Yangjing Middle School, Lao Baidu South Street, Xiechangli, Rongchang Road, Dongchang Road, Lane 69, Lane 170, Lane 188, Lane 316, Lane 228, Lane 551, Lan Nidu, Beihutang Road and other places, there are a total of about 6,000 households and more than 30,000 people. The above is a rough description of the distribution of shantytowns in Shanghai.</p>
<p>At this time of freezing cold, these hundreds of thousands of people are trembling in small sheds and wrestling with death. If you turn into some secluded alleyways, you will find packages of dead children or frozen old people from time to time. They are innocent, but this is their destiny and destination. I hereby write down what I have investigated to provide reference for the sponsoring relief agencies and charitable organizations. At the same time, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association has collected this material as a basis for running children's welfare stations.</p>
<h3>Serious Social Problem: Female Prison Also Suffering from Overcrowding; Yu Aizhen's Handiwork is Excellent; Yu Xiangyan's Temper is Somewhat Arrogant</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The impression gained after visiting the female prison is that it is clean and orderly.</p>
<p>The female prison is located in a corner of the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. It is a four-story Western-style building. The space is not large, but it houses over 240 female prisoners, which makes it appear extremely crowded. Originally, the court allocated space with the initial assumption that there wouldn't be too many female prisoners. Unexpectedly, in times of war and chaos, the number of women committing crimes has gradually increased. It is said that the detention center of the District Court alone holds over a thousand female prisoners. As sentenced prisoners are successively transferred to the female prison, there is already a problem of being unable to accommodate them.</p>
<p>When we visited, each female prisoner was engrossed in knitting woolen sweaters, which is one of the largest production activities in the prison. She Aizhen, the wife of Shi , and Ye Jiqing, the wife of Li Shi, were both quietly working. According to Section Chief Li Meihun, Yu Aizhen's handiwork is excellent and she has a gentle disposition, while Ye Jiqing's work is relatively poor. As for Yu Xiangyan, the female protagonist in the embezzlement case of the Two-Roads Bureau Materials Department, she has a bad temper, appears somewhat arrogant, and is not interested in working. In addition to knitting woolen sweaters, other work includes threading, making shoes, making Western-style children's clothing, embroidery, laundry, making toothbrushes, powder puffs, gloves, and pasting matchboxes, etc.</p>
<p>Mostly Gluttonous and Lazy; Appropriate Education is Provided</p>
<p>Last December's net profit was over 15 million yuan. Workers receive bonuses, which are divided into four grades according to their diligence and skill: 25%, 20%, 15%, and 10% of their earnings. According to Section Chief Lin Xiaoming, these female prisoners were mostly extremely lazy at home and did not know how to do anything. After receiving instruction in prison, only four female prisoners can now make fine-quality clothing, which shows how much they usually enjoyed eating and disliking work. In addition to working, they receive daily education, which is divided into eight classes based on their level of knowledge, with courses in Mandarin, arithmetic, common knowledge, and music. Those with higher levels of knowledge are instructed to keep diaries to observe their thoughts and conduct.</p>
<p>Eight Innocent Babies Living the Same Prison Life</p>
<p>Special attention is also paid to spiritual transformation. Miss Zhu from the Moore Memorial Church Women's Evangelistic Band, Sister Pan from the Catholic Church, Miss Li from the Christian Church, and the Salvation Army take turns giving sermons, hoping to transform these female prisoners with Christian teachings so that they can become good people after their release.</p>
<p>Many female prisoners were already pregnant before entering prison and gave birth in the female prison. There are now eight little babies in the female prison, who are cared for by wet nurses. The oldest baby is less than one year old, and the youngest is only two months old. These little angels smile and open their little mouths when they see people, unaware that their mothers are living behind bars. The Children's Welfare Promotion Association visited recently and, seeing the pitiful babies of these prisoners, sent five cases of milk and a large bottle of cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Not Afraid of the Law For the Sake of Survival</p>
<p>Prisoners are allowed to receive food from their families once a week and visit with their families once every two weeks. Drug-related offenses are the most common type of crime. According to Section Chief Li, during these drug offenders' family visits, it can be seen from their tone of conversation that their families are still engaged in selling and transporting drugs, and they are not deterred by the fact that they are facing charges. This is indeed a serious social problem. For the sake of survival, many people are taking risks. Seeing the number of criminals in society increasing day by day, we wonder how much power the law and prisons really have.</p>

<h3>Quarrel Over Debt Leads to Secret Revelation; Investigation Traces Back to Yangjiazhai, Anren Street, Nanshi; Counterfeit Money Operation Busted</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Han Lao Zhong, Chen Zhi Cai, Wang Xiao Qing, and Ju Ling Zhi, four trainee patrol officers from the Putuo Road Police Station, were patrolling Changshou Road around 8:00 PM on the 30th of last month when they heard a quarrel near the entrance of Da De Cloth Store at No. 88. They entered the store and learned that Zhang Asheng was ordered by his cousin Ju Zhongda to return 1 million yuan in cash to the store. A partner discovered that each bill was a 5,000-yuan counterfeit note. Zhou, who resides at No. 85 Tokyo Lane, Tokyo Road, was arrested by Patrol Officer Han and others. Six million seven hundred and fifty thousand yuan in counterfeit notes were found at the home of his neighbor, Xu Baowang. Zhou confessed that the counterfeit notes were purchased from Lu Huanrong in the thatched shed of Bai Guocao on Jiangpu Road for 4.5 million yuan in legal tender in exchange for 10 million yuan in counterfeit notes. They then went to the aforementioned location and arrested Lu, who confessed that he bought them from Fang Qiao at No. 65 Yangjiazhai, Anren Street, Nanshi. The officers then went to Nanshi, arrested Fang, and seized counterfeit printing plates, manufacturing machinery, and a stack of printed and unprinted counterfeit notes at his home. They were taken to the station for strict interrogation, but they refused to confess fully. The case was periodically submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Student Aid Application Forms; All Issued for University and Middle School Groups</h3>
<p>The 37th Annual Spring "Reader Student Aid Fund" organized by this newspaper has been proceeding smoothly since fundraising began on January 12, thanks to the enthusiastic support and constant donations from caring readers. As the winter vacation has ended and the spring semester is approaching, this newspaper has been working diligently on investigation and registration work in recent days. As for the application method, the previous year's method of school recommendation will continue to be used in order to simplify procedures and improve efficiency.

Application forms for middle schools were also issued yesterday, with a total of 320 copies to 70 schools such as Huxin. It is hoped that the school authorities will distribute them to outstanding students from poor families as soon as they receive the application forms, and submit them to this newspaper for preliminary review after they have been filled out in accordance with the instructions. They will then be forwarded to the Municipal Student Aid Unified Review Committee for final review, and the student aid will be distributed on a regular basis.

Students applying should take note.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute at Ling Liang Church; Former Director of Social Affairs Bureau Welfare Department Leads Crowd to Evict Residents; Church Members Indignant and Appeal to All Parties</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Ling Liang Church and affiliated Ling Liang Elementary School at the intersection of Liyang Road and Tiantong Road in Hongkou, as well as the house where Reverend Zhao Shiguang of the church resides, were suddenly forcibly occupied by Zhai Dianrong, who claimed to be from the Kaina Housing Rental Office, and a dozen others on the morning of the 26th of last month. They brought suitcases, bedding, and other items, stayed overnight unlawfully, and forcibly converted the reception room and classrooms into "offices" and "staff dormitories," throwing Reverend Zhao's personal belongings out the door. The next day, Ling Liang Elementary School held a closing ceremony, and they wrote in white paint on the walls, "Housing Recovered for Own Use" and "The Housing Here Has Been Returned." At the same time, they cut off the water pipes, causing dozens of people to panic over drinking water, and the telephone was also damaged. The next day, they invaded and occupied the female staff dormitory on the third floor. One of the female teachers surnamed Xia was bedridden with illness, but they disregarded her. Reverend Zhao's mother-in-law is old and seriously ill, and her illness was aggravated by this fright. Those living in the church are all elderly women, weak women, and children. They wailed and were anxious due to this disturbance, making a pitiful sight. Although Reverend Zhao negotiated with them and reported it to the police, there were no results. The church members are all extremely indignant about this and are appealing to all parties. Yesterday was Sunday worship, and Reverend Zhao could only preach to the believers in the open air.</p>
<p>It is reported that the building at No. 1040 Shenyang Road was originally the police dormitory of the Japanese consulate, and there was also a church in it. After the victory, it was taken over by the Bureau of Social Affairs and allocated to the staff of the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Central Trust Bureau. The church portion was allocated to Reverend Zhao Shiguang for the establishment of the Ling Liang Church. Originally, it was considered enemy property, and the residents paid safekeeping fees to the Central Trust Bureau. In February of last year, the property rights of the above-mentioned building were approved by the agency handling enemy property to be returned to the original owner, Kenna, a Czech citizen, and the original residents continued to rent the property. At that time, Kenna was eager to go to the United States and asked the residents to elect a representative to sign a contract with him. All the rent would be collected from the residents by the representative and paid at once. At that time, Cai Dianrong was the director of the Welfare Department of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. Without being publicly elected by the residents, he acted as a representative and signed a rental contract with Kenna, starting from June 1 of last year. Since then, he has acted as a sub-landlord. Reverend Zhao has now received a letter from Robbie Gike, Kenna's trustee, stating that no one may occupy the Ling Liang Church property until Kenna returns to Shanghai, and Reverend Zhao has full authority to reside there. Please inform Cais that he must wait until Kenna returns to Shanghai in May of this year before the shareholders make a decision . Cai's actions are illegal.</p>

<h3>Hai Zhe Ship Arrives This Morning; Delayed by Heavy Fog Outside the Yangtze River Estuary</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Hai Zhe ship, carrying the second batch of Japanese reparations materials returning to the country, arrived at the Yangtze River estuary on the 31st. However, due to heavy fog, it was unable to enter the port. The small wheel carrying personnel from the China Merchants Bureau and Customs returned to the city at around 3:00 AM. According to a reporter from Shen Wan, the ship is expected to enter the port at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Various Factories Request to Purchase the First Batch of Japanese Reparations Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The first batch of Japanese reparations materials arriving in Shanghai, including those available for private enterprises, have been concentrated in the warehouse at the China Merchants Bureau's No. 7 Wharf under the custody of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office and have not yet been unpacked. The application period for private factories to purchase them is set from January 8 to March 15 of this year. The Guidance Office has prepared various forms and guidelines, priced at 100,000 yuan per copy, to facilitate applications from factories. It is reported that a considerable number of factories have applied. Some are going through the procedures with the Guidance Office, while most are directly contacting the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Although this batch of materials was dismantled from Japanese military factories, they consist of small machine tools that can be used by various industries. Therefore, the industries that applied last month were mainly cotton mills and coal mining companies. The allocation price of the reparations materials still awaits a decision from the Price Evaluation Committee. Factories that moved inland previously requested preferential treatment, but there have been no results to date.</p>

Seventeen directors and supervisors were elected in succession, and Ma Yunlong was elected as the director-general. The establishment of the branch was repeatedly opposed by the company authorities, who believed that the Public Transportation Company is a municipal enterprise and that automobile drivers have civil servant status and should not join the union. However, the drivers' union stated that the number of Public Transportation Company drivers who voluntarily wished to participate accounted for two-thirds of the total, and a branch could be established in accordance with the law. It will file with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs today. As for the rumored brewing strike, it is absolutely untrue. The union also stated that it is willing to cooperate with the company authorities in the future to resolve any problems. It also stated that Huang Bingfang, a union director (who is a driver for the Transportation Company), was fired for participating in the preparatory work of the ninth branch, and the union is now legally demanding reinstatement, but it will not use a strike as a threat.</p>

<h3>Xinjiang Problems: Thirty Years of Shadows and Future Prospects - Special Correspondent for this Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Ma Cibo</p>
<p>The Xinjiang problem should be viewed holistically. The origins of all problems have a cause-and-effect relationship. To seek a thorough solution, one cannot approach it piecemeal from a local perspective. It is necessary to consider the overall trend and make a complete transformation to achieve practical results. The Xinjiang governance plan, written based on the spirit of peaceful unification, democracy, and solidarity, will forever be supported by the people of Xinjiang. It is a legal code for resolving the entire Xinjiang issue. Zhang Zhizhong will vigorously promote his new policies in Xinjiang. He has pledged to implement the true nationalism of the Premier in Xinjiang, ensuring equality for all ethnic groups within the country. Since the implementation of this new policy, the status of Han people in Xinjiang will be reduced from rulers to ordinary citizens, appearing in Xinjiang society only as a regular ethnic group. This is a blow and a satire to the superior Han Chinese mindset, because the Xinjiang regime has always been in the hands of Han people, from the Border Defense Commissioner and Provincial Governor to the third-class bailiffs in the county government, all monopolized by Han people. Their method of treating Xinjiang compatriots has a catchphrase: "Three kind words are not as good as one horsewhip," meaning that the people of Xinjiang only have the freedom to be beaten, not the freedom to speak. This oppressive political tradition has caused countless disturbances in Xinjiang. They also say that disturbances are a hobby of the Xinjiang people, with a formula of a minor revolt every thirty years and a major revolt every sixty years. The ruling class never admits their own mistakes, creating a revolt, followed by a conquest, beautifully named "punishing the people for their crimes."</p>
<p>Adopting a Democratic Attitude, Dealing with it Generously and Calmly</p>
<p>General Zhang Zhizhong could not bear to let this historical cycle of evil continue to unfold and decided to create a new page in history and open up a new political path. Xinjiang has thus undergone a complete transformation. A large number of Han administrative cadres have been eliminated, and outstanding talents from indigenous ethnic groups are employed as much as possible to participate in administrative work. General Zhang has truly shown utmost kindness and courtesy to compatriots of the Turkic language family. Whatever they asked for, he approved. For example, reducing the burden on the people, issuing tax exemption orders, releasing political prisoners detained over the years, and approving the return of people's property confiscated by the former Commissioner's Office. Reaffirming the decree protecting the people's personal freedom, ordering the prohibition of marriage between Han and Uyghur people, abolishing the medical office, disbanding the trading company, reducing the size of the National Army, adjusting personnel of various administrative commissioners, and electing county chiefs, etc., all are implementing democratic politics in a step-by-step manner according to the demands of the people. However, the four million compatriots in Xinjiang only have two paths psychologically: either planning to be the ruling class or preparing to be the ruled. There is no second political habit besides these. The sudden appearance of a democratic government with a spirit of the times has aroused great psychological contradictions among the Xinjiang compatriots who have no democratic experience, seemingly misunderstanding the true meaning of the democratic spirit. A small number of Uyghur compatriots who call themselves progressives, with the support of Yining, formed a group that is anti-national, anti-National Army, and anti-Han Chinese, becoming rampant in various places. First, on July 5, 1946, they murdered aviator Jin Xueqin in Antarctica, and the murderers and suspects were forcibly taken away by the crowd during interrogation, threatening the dignity of the law. At the same time, women married to Han Chinese were dragged into mosques and forced to remarry, causing disturbances in the city of Dihua. Those who were considered pro-Han ethnic traitors were often beaten and humiliated by the masses. Then, the leader of the group sent by the provincial government to the Ashan area to supervise the election, Tu Yuze, an outstanding member of the Kazakh ethnic group, was killed on the way. Refugees who had returned from the Soviet Union after the peace were massacred and humiliated in Tacheng. Transportation in Yining was intermittent, the army refused to be reorganized, the administration refused to be unified, and the arrogance of the violent elements in Dihua remained high. They once surrounded the Highway Bureau, the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Health Department, and provincial government meetings, proposing 48 unreasonable demands, causing the February 25th bloodshed incident. After the breakup of the Provincial Senate, the Beitashan incident and the Turpan unrest occurred one after another, leading to the resignation of Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang. Throughout this series of unfortunate events, General Zhang Zhizhong has always adopted a generous, peaceful, and democratic attitude, hoping to turn big problems into small ones and small problems into nothing. Today, Vice Chairman A is still corresponding by letter, hoping that he will return soon to discuss further. Anyone with a fragile spirit cannot withstand this kind of political pressure and feels the crisis of peace, even doubting the correctness of General Zhang Zhizhong's policies.</p>
<p>No one dares to guarantee how long peace in Xinjiang can be maintained, but one more day is always better than one less day. People who are concerned about the Xinjiang issue but do not fully understand the situation in Xinjiang will certainly doubt the current policy, believing that General Zhang Zhizhong's generous and democratic approach is sufficient to increase the arrogance of those who are anti-national and anti-Han Chinese, seeming weak and powerless. In fact, the thoughts and remarks against the country and against the Han Chinese in Xinjiang are partly a legacy of history and partly the temptation of external forces. They are not produced under a peaceful and democratic political system. We cannot therefore think that peace is hopeless. This is precisely the goal of our efforts to strive for peace. At the same time, the environment in Xinjiang is different from that in the interior. Although there are no party disputes, it is directly controlled by an invisible force, and the situation is quite complicated. We must recognize that the force supporting the Xinjiang issue is not in Xinjiang. The vast number of Xinjiang compatriots of all ethnic groups are the object of our struggle and sympathy, not the object of our struggle. Therefore, a generous, peaceful, and democratic policy is sufficient to increase the internal role of the four million people, strengthen the stability of peace, and create our political advantage. Therefore, General Zhang Zhizhong's peaceful, democratic, generous, and patient political style is not a show of weakness to Yining, but to win over the four million compatriots in Xinjiang and bring them into the heart of the country.</p>
<p>The Most Favorable Situation, Peace is the Grasp</p>
<p>The most favorable situation for us in Xinjiang is peace. One more day of peace, one more minute of preparation, one more minute of preparation, the more grasp we have. This year's situation is much better than last year's. If we maintain it for another year, next year will certainly be more optimistic than this year.</p>
<p>Dealing with things on a temporary basis and dealing with things on a long-term basis are fundamentally different. When we read the notes of the negotiations of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Li Hongzhang, under the threat of Japanese imperialism, the constraints of corrupt Manchu nobles and princes, and the condemnation and opposition of the people of the whole country, assessed the situation and decisively signed the unequal treaty that humiliated the country. He retreated to prepare for reform, progress, and strive for rejuvenation. Today, we realize that Li Hongzhang's vision was far-sighted, his chest was broad, and his spirit was magnificent, enough to be an immortal figure in history. The peaceful resolution of the Yining incident this time cannot be compared with the nature of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, because the Treaty of Shimonoseki is the most humiliating page in the history of national humiliation. The resolution of the Yining incident not only dealt with a serious diplomatic offensive, but also resolved internal ethnic disputes. It is an important task of China's political construction, but the difficulties encountered in the negotiations were only one assassin less than the Treaty of Shimonoseki. From the point of view of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhizhong are really no different.</p>
<p>Although the Xinjiang issue cannot be completely resolved due to the success of peaceful negotiations, our country has officially consulted on the sovereignty of Xinjiang territory since the peaceful negotiations. This is a fact. For more than a year, relying on General Zhang Zhizhong's efforts, there has been a preliminary stable situation. In the future, if we want to seek long-term peace and stability, we must have practical performance and carry out various constructions. This cannot be done by the power of Xinjiang itself. Human and material resources must be assisted by various departments of the country. As long as the country is willing to spend money, the future of Xinjiang is hopeful. The reason why Li Hongzhang could not revive China was that his ideals and plans could not get the support of the court and the cooperation of his colleagues, and he was depressed. We hope that the future of Xinjiang will not follow this path.</p>
<p>Yining's Power is Weak, it is Difficult for a Mantis to Stop a Cart</p>
<p>Ahemaitijiang's departure from Dihua did not attract the attention of any Xinjiang people. This proves that he has lost a pivotal role in Xinjiang politics. In the past year, he has exhausted all his political capital and has not achieved much. His followers have disintegrated, his manipulated people's riots have failed, and his plan to control the Provincial Senate and use public opinion to liquidate the Han Chinese regime has also failed. In the end, he could only quietly float back to Yining like a feather. This is the end of his political career. Saying that his departure from Dihua has any impact on the situation in Xinjiang, we really cannot see it, because when he was in charge of the provincial government in Dihua, the three districts of Yita and A were still protecting their special status, and it was just the same after he left Dihua. Saying that he went back to launch a war, the facts are not simple. If Yining wants to launch a war, it can only be an international war, otherwise Yining's small power is absolutely not enough to stop a cart with the arms of a mantis, because the morale and public support of our Xinjiang are not comparable to what they were a year ago. Everyone seems to be confident in dealing with the situation. As for whether someone will launch an international war in Xinjiang at this time, from all aspects, it is still too early. This kind of concern will only arise on the eve of the outbreak of the Third World War. Therefore, my view on the Xinjiang issue is that there is no need to expect to recover Yining in a peaceful way. Even if Ahemaitijiang is willing to turn back, he cannot represent Yining's return to the motherland. The special status of the three districts of Yita and A can only be clarified after the entire world issue is cleared up.</p>
<p>Any Terror Policy Does Not Meet the Needs of the People</p>
<p>After Ahemaitijiang flew back to Yining, there were many rumors in Dihua. Some said that he was actively preparing for war and conscripting young men, some said that he was depressed and had no activities, and some said that his actions were restricted and he had lost full freedom. There is also a rumor that a part of the Communist bandits in the Northeast has been transported to Yining. Let's put aside the situation of Ahemaitijiang for now. However, it is indeed necessary to refute the rumors about the infiltration of the Chinese Communists into Yining. Although the Chinese Communist bandits are a group of red traitors who are ubiquitous, their scope of activities is also restricted by their masters. Xinjiang is a region directly controlled by the International Communist Party, and there is absolutely no room for the activities of the Chinese Communists. During the Sheng Shicai era, the Chinese Communists sent a large number of cadres to Xinjiang, but they could only assist the Xinjiang government in their personal capacity to promote the six major policies, and they were absolutely not allowed to develop the organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang. It was not that the Chinese Communists were unwilling to carry out activities in Xinjiang, but that their masters did not allow them to carry out activities. Xinjiang is a backward feudal society, the place with the most Islam. All problems are inseparable from religion, ethnicity, and politics. Political instigation is anti-national, ethnic instigation is anti-Han Chinese, and religion tends to be Turkic-Islamicism. The call of the East Turkestan People's Republic has a trinity effect of religion, ethnicity, and politics. Although the Communists are anti-national, they cannot get rid of their Han Chinese skin. If we use the Communists to help Yining today, it is to drive away the old Han Chinese with the new Han Chinese. In the eyes of the Xinjiang people, although the old Han Chinese are annoying, there are still places to miss them. The new Han Chinese bring a terror policy, and the lessons of Sheng Shicai are not far away. It really does not meet the needs of the Xinjiang people, and it is actually impossible. Rumors are just rumors after all. This kind of rumor may be intentionally manufactured by someone, so I will explain it along the way.</p>
<p>The Election of the Chairman by the People Will Naturally Lead to a Bright Political Situation</p>
<p>At present, the important task of Xinjiang is to improve administrative efficiency, strengthen various constructions, strive for peace opportunities, and get the politics of the seven districts on the right track. As for the brightness of the political situation in Xinjiang, it depends on the future elected chairman. Whether Mr. Maisiwude, who is opposed by Yining, wants to gain the support of the people of the whole Xinjiang, he has to be tested. It depends entirely on his performance during this period of governance. Other possible competitors, on the Han side, perhaps Mr. Chen Xihao, the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Department, will participate. Mr. Chen has been in Xinjiang for many years and can fully understand the crux of the Xinjiang issue and its difficulties. We believe that Mr. Chen's intention is definitely not just to be the chairman of Xinjiang. As for the Hui and Kazakh compatriots, they do not seem to be prepared. On the Tatar side, there is Mr. Bao Erhan, who is the only scholar in Xinjiang. Although he is not used to political life, there is no suitable candidate other than him. There are also Mr. Yimin and Mr. Aisha, who are quite energetic. As long as they do not forget that there are 14 ethnic groups in Xinjiang and can seek happiness for the 14 ethnic groups, it is okay to try it. If we let the four million people of Xinjiang freely elect, we believe that everyone will unanimously support General Zhang Zhizhong, because the people have already felt that only General Zhang can effectively help the people of Xinjiang to seek happiness.

<h3>National Judicial Administration Review Conference Decides to Establish Recidivist Prisons to Eliminate the Accumulation of Bullying</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou on the 1st of this newspaper] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has learned that prison riots have occurred frequently in various places recently. After investigating the reasons, it is actually due to a small number of prisoners with bad character. Although they are in prison, they still refuse to repent. They bully new prisoners, cause trouble, and lead riots, which is a loss of the original purpose of prisons to detain criminals in the hope that they will repent and reform themselves. After the National Judicial Administration Review Conference decided to establish recidivist prisons to eliminate the accumulation of bullying, one will be set up in each province. All recidivists and criminals with bad character in the province's prisons will be transferred to that prison for execution. Distinctions will be made within the prison, and they will be imprisoned in separate rooms. It is learned that the Suzhou High Court has recently received this notice and has decided to designate Zhenjiang Prison to add single prison cells this year to house recidivists from the entire Jiangsu Province. Before it is completed, the prisons will first imprison the recidivists they are holding separately.</p>
<h3>Huangtiangang Port, a Commercial Port in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Report from Jiangyin on January 30th of this newspaper] Huangtiangang Port in this county has become the lifeline for ships entering and exiting since the bandits appeared in northern Jiangsu. The Council has high hopes for the port improvement plan in the Xinyang Port construction plan. It wants to build wharves along the river and build warehouses. In the future, when the Xiyu Railway is successful and connects to the Beijing-Shanghai line, it will become the only modern commercial port in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Since the failure of the Shengchangde German business to transport flour, on January 15th, a huge cargo ship was not allowed to enter the port without inspection, and five large ships were overturned by wind and waves, resulting in a loss of 6-7 billion. Merchants and travelers regard this port as a dangerous place. This county is located at the throat of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The Narrowest River Surface</p>
<p>It is convenient for investigation work, and has always had a checkpoint set up. In October last year, a Jianghai sub-customs was established. They do not pay much attention to ships in the inner harbor. The main thing is anti-smuggling work on the river. Regardless of domestic and foreign merchant ships, they have to stop at the port to wait for customs inspection. They only add inspection and do not collect taxes, because the tax has already been paid at the Shanghai Zhenguan Port. They only need to check the tickets. If there is tax evasion, they will be punished according to the regulations after the inspection. In the past, the customs power was in the hands of foreigners, commonly known as foreign customs. All documents were written in English, and the customs declarations were a combination of Chinese and Western. Because they were opposed, they have now been changed to Chinese. With the customs, there are many customs declaration offices in the port, as many as a dozen. Their business is that every ship entering and exiting needs to report the name, quantity, destination, and location of the goods to the customs office, explain in detail, and verify the documents to request help with customs procedures. The customs office charges some handling fees, but there is no fixed price. Each ship costs tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Shallow Water in Winter</p>
<p>The port is small. Every day, there are five ferry companies operating between Jiangyin and Jingjiang across the river, including Jiangjing, Jiangli, Datong, Jiangshun, and Wuhe, with a total of six ferries, each of which can accommodate about 10,000 people. Each passenger ferry fee is 3,000 yuan. Now the water is shallow, and the ferries cannot enter the port. They stop on the river bank, and you have to row a boat to get ashore, which costs 5-6,000 yuan per passenger. If you have cargo, you have to pay double. The ferries operate in shifts, one every half an hour. There are also two shipping companies, Yangzi and Jianzhong, which specialize in transporting goods between Jing and Zhen. The Yidu Bureau is managed by the relief center and is jointly organized by the old Jiangyin and Jingjiang counties. There are now two Yidu boats, which also ferry passengers in shifts and charge ferry fees. Before the war, no ferry fees were charged. In fact, there is no "Yidu" significance anymore. In addition, there are 70-80 ferry boats from the east bank to the west bank, from the inner harbor to the outer harbor. The ferry fee is not fixed. There are different prices for local people and foreigners. The ordinary ferry to the other side of the river costs 3-4,000 yuan, and to the port costs 20,000 yuan. They are most welcome by large merchant ships, because when they drop the anchor to go ashore, report to customs for inspection, and come from the center of the river, it costs at least hundreds of thousands. A ferry boat at the entrance of the customs sub-customs specializes in ferrying customs officers, costing 5,000 yuan each time, and it is operated by one family. Each customs office has an income of several thousand to more than a million yuan a month, which is quite considerable. Because of the congestion of ships, there are river cleaning service personnel,</p>
<p>Specially in Charge</p>
<p>Maintain the order of ships in the port, but if you want your ship to advance first, you need to use money. Those with money are arranged to go first, and those without money are left to stop. It costs hundreds of thousands for a pig boat. Since the unprecedented shipwreck tragedy occurred, all parties have paid attention to the order of the port. After Kong Siling strictly cracked down, the entry and exit of ships in the port has improved. Large and small ships are proceeding one after another, but I am afraid it will not last long and will become boring over time.</p>
<p>The most disputes are the loading and unloading industry organizations. They are divided into several groups, each group operates, and they are very clear and do not infringe on each other. Each group has considerable influence. The port group has the most capital. If someone exceeds the line to unload goods, a martial arts drama will happen immediately. Although the party and government organs have held meetings many times to stipulate, it has not been completely resolved. In the near future, the county government will have to hold another meeting to formulate a practical method to avoid the recurrence of disputes. In addition, there are rickshaw pullers at the port who "ask for prices everywhere and settle on the ground". They</p>
<p>Main Customers</p>
<p>Are passengers traveling to and from the north and south. Many rickshaw pullers gather at the checkpoint and squeeze to the river bank. Ignoring the danger, they swarm onto the ship. They jostle back and forth in the cabin. If there is a customer with luggage, they grab it. From the port to the North City Bus Station, it costs tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, and the price is doubled in the rain. The day before yesterday, a female passenger spent 110,000 yuan to get from the port to the Xiaobei Bridge outside the North City because she had luggage, and the rickshaw pullers fought with each other. If the passenger cannot agree on the price with the rickshaw puller and thinks the price is too expensive, other rickshaw pullers will ask for even higher prices, so you will not be able to get a bargain. If you go to Puhui Bridge, there is no such phenomenon.</p>
<p>Chengyi and Northern Jiangsu Jingjiang are Only</p>
<p>Across the River</p>
<p>To prevent and investigate, a checkpoint is set up at the port, with military police stationed. The inspection is divided into two categories: passengers and ships. The most attention is paid to the identity of the passengers. The goods carried by the ships must be registered, but no fees are charged. Since the shipwreck tragedy, the authorities have sent personnel to supervise everything at the port, which has improved compared to before, and the inspection is completed quickly. There is also a ship management office, which performs its duties at the port. Local people hope that this port will prosper, and then the Xinyang Yin construction plan will have hope of realization.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Announces to Citizens to Pay Taxes in Full</h3>
<p>[Report from Zhenjiang on February 1st of this newspaper] The provincial government has recently announced to the citizens of the province, stating that during the period of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, the expenses for important policies such as self-defense and autonomy are huge. It sincerely hopes that the public will pay all taxes in full and share the difficulties. If tax officials are found to be engaged in corruption, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Good News from Nantong's Conscription: Hu Hanyun Draws the First Lot, and his Elder Brother Voluntarily Enlists in Place of his Younger Brother</h3>
<p>[Report from Nantong on January 31st of this newspaper] The emergency conscription work in this county has already been launched. There is even a good story about two brothers competing to enlist in the Tangzha Shiyan District of the county. Hu Hanyun, a young man from the Seventh Jia of the Eleventh Bao of Shizhun Township in the district, was drawn in the first lot and immediately volunteered to enlist. When his brother Hu Han-cheng learned about this, he stepped forward and was willing to enlist in place of his younger brother, resulting in the two brothers arguing with each other. In the end, the brother Hu Han-cheng enlisted. The public believes that this brother, who understands the righteousness of suppressing the rebellion and building the country and competes to join the army, is a model for young men of the appropriate age.</p>
<p>[Report from Wuxing on January 31st of this newspaper] The County Conscription Association held its sixth meeting on the afternoon of the 30th and decided to conscript half of the full quota before February 10th, with the principle of sending one recruit from each Bao first. However, it is the time of the strict New Year's Day, and the traffic is cut off. It was requested to the provincial government to approve a one-month extension. It was reported by Section Chief Wang of the County Government that he was ordered to participate in the military section chief conscription conference of twelve counties to discuss important cases: This year's conscription must be done by lottery, and the principle is not to buy volunteers. The living expenses for new recruits are stipulated as follows: Shop households, Class A 600,000 yuan, Class B 500,000 yuan, Class C 400,000 yuan, Class D 300,000 yuan, Class E 100,000 yuan, Resident households, Class A 100,000 yuan, Class B 80,000 yuan, Class C 50,000 yuan, Class D 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Report from Haining on the 1st] The county government held a conscription association on the 31st, and the conscription quotas for each township have been determined and announced, and the lottery method will be adopted. The conscription will be launched from February 1st.</p>
<p>[Report from Wujin on January 31st of this newspaper] The emergency conscription in this county, as of the 30th, has a large shortage. The people in the townships feel that it is difficult for the young men to enlist at the end of the year. Most of the people who handle it draw lots urgently and transmit them at night, which inevitably harasses them. It is difficult to blame them. The South Jiangsu Garrison District telegraphed the county to speed up the conscription to meet the quota, otherwise the conscription would be delayed, and the officials in charge of the conscription would be severely punished.</p>
<p>[Report from Changshu on January 31st of this newspaper] The county government is handling emergency conscription, and the townships have decided to meet the quota within the time limit. County Magistrate Zhang issued a special order on the 31st, stating that it is illegal to allocate the standing self-defense force of the security team to fill the conscription quota, and it will affect the public security. It will definitely not be implemented and strictly orders each township to send enough troops.</p>
<h3>Fengxian Raises and Distributes Living Rice for Young Men</h3>

<h3>Communist Bandits' Atrocities in Lingyuan, Rehe</h3>
<p>[Report from Chengde on January 28th] Recently, the Communist bandits in Lingyuan, Rehe, were afraid that the middle peasants in the Lingyuan bandit area would respond to the establishment of the Lingyuan Homecoming Team by our province, so the Communist bandits' county government secretly sent six instructors to various districts to carry out activities. Each village sent several turned-over members to secretly monitor the middle and rich peasants, and notified each middle peasant family to send one person to the bandit government to attend a meeting to discuss public grain. The middle peasants were all tricked into attending the meeting, and then they were colluded with us. Their names were all detained. At this time, the turned-over members also reported one after another. For example, Nanlu Yi reported more than 80 people. According to incomplete statistics, more than 600 people have been reported in the whole county. If anyone is found to be disobedient, they will be killed by being tied to a dog, a high tree and strangulation. At night, the people were not allowed to close their doors, and they could enter and leave people's homes at night to listen and investigate. During the reporting, the people were strictly forbidden to pass.</p>
<h3>Recent News on "Double Gun" Wang Ba-mei</h3>
<p>[Report from Pinghu, this newspaper, January 30th] The movements of "Double Gun" Wang Ba-mei have long been widely discussed. However, recent rumors circulating outside have been largely inaccurate. According to recent news received by this newspaper: the Pinghu Self-Defense Third Brigade she led was reorganized into the Pinghu County Self-Defense Third Company in December of the 30th year of the Republic of China. Later, it was reorganized again into the Security Police. She retired to farming at that time and has not held any positions as commander of armed forces since. Furthermore, in the 35th year of the Republic, she was elected as a Pinghu County Councilor by the members of the Pinghu County Farmers' Association, and her work is quite demanding. The rumors of a mutiny among her former troops are clearly unfounded.</p>

<h3>Huang Shao-hong Returns to Guangxi and Writes a Poem</h3>
<p>[Report from Guilin, this newspaper, January 28th] National Government member Huang Shao-hong returned to his hometown after many years to participate in the Legislative Yuan election. He stayed in his home village in Rong County for a few days, then passed through Liuzhou and arrived in Guilin. He carefully investigated the situation along the way and expressed great satisfaction with the province's recovery and reconstruction. Huang is skilled in poetry and prose. In Liuzhou, he was moved by the scenery and wrote a "Lang Tao Sha" poem, titled "Feelings on Returning to Guangxi":</p>
<p>"Returning after ten years away, children line the road, laughing as they look, pointing out the differences from the past, hair graying at the temples.</p>
<p>The road is difficult and arduous, the flames of war have left devastation. Destruction comes easily, but reconstruction is difficult. What survives the calamity, its true face unchanged? Only the green mountains."</p>
<p>These few lines truly express the vicissitudes of the past decade. The homeland's mountains and rivers, new sorrows and old hatreds, fill the spaces between the words.</p>

<h3>15th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society Opened Yesterday Morning in the Capital Wu Cheng-luo Hopes the Government Will Support Pure Scientific Research Zhou Hongjing Emphasizes Research Publications Must Improve Standards</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, February 1st] The 15th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society opened at 9 AM on the 1st in the capital, chaired by Wu Cheng-luo, Chairman of the Society. More than 100 members attended, including Gao Jiyu, Li Jingsheng, and Chen Yuguang. Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi, Secretary-General Xue Cixin, Director Zhou Hongjing of the Higher Education Department representing Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, and Counselor Zheng Ruogu representing the Ministry of Social Affairs were also present. Chairman Wu Cheng-luo delivered a speech, stating that this was the second annual meeting after the recovery. The overall situation has been unstable in recent years, and the lives of scholars have been very difficult. Although the research results still include more than 30 papers, it is barely satisfactory. However, compared to the past, when each meeting had more than 100 papers, it is indeed inferior. In the future, it is hoped that society and the government can pay more attention to and support pure scientific research such as chemistry, and all members should also encourage each other to intensify research in the face of all difficulties. The Board of Directors has also decided to reprint the Society's journal to inspire research enthusiasm with the glorious historical records of the past. Regarding the implementation of research results, the lack of equipment and funding makes scholars feel powerless. It is hoped that all members and opinion leaders will find ways to bring this to the attention of the government. In addition to considering manufacturers, do not forget the pure scientific research that is the foundation of this industry when it comes to import foreign exchange and low-interest loans. After Wu's speech, Director Zhou Hongjing delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Zhu Jiahua, hoping that the annual meeting would provide opinions on the practical design of research funding allocation, the standards of chemistry courses in universities and middle schools, and the nature of graduate students in domestic colleges and universities. He especially emphasized the need to improve the standards of research publications to a certain level and establish authority. As for the Ministry of Education's subsidies, it will do its best to help. Subsequently, Counselor Zheng Ruogu, representing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and member Chen Yuguang delivered speeches. The meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, at 2 PM, the discussion of papers began. On the morning of the 2nd, the affairs of the society were discussed. In the afternoon, at the invitation of the Ministry of National Defense and the National Defense Science Commission, a National Defense Science Symposium was held, followed by continued discussion of papers and proposals. On the 3rd, the Yongli Chemical Plant was visited, and unfinished matters were concluded. In the evening at 6 PM, all attending members had an annual banquet, and the conference closed.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University President Cheng Xiao-gang Resigns The Shanghai Alumni Association Cables the Ministry of Education to Retain Him</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Announces the Effectiveness of the Post-War Regional Planning and Establishment of Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing Airmail] In the past, the Ministry of Education announced that during the war, secondary schools in various provinces and cities had either been closed, merged, relocated inland, or newly established, and there were many changes. The establishment of secondary schools has mostly lost its balance, so after the end of the war, it ordered various provinces and cities to seize the opportunity of repatriation to plan and establish various types of secondary schools in order to be reasonable. According to the Ministry of Education's summary and compilation of the implementation situation over the past two years, the implementation results are as follows: In general, all provinces and cities can divide middle school districts, normal school districts, and vocational school districts according to the degree of development of population area, economic transportation, and cultural undertakings. The various types of schools in the middle school district, normal school district, and vocational school district are geographically coordinated and can be balanced without excessive density. The distance between different types of secondary schools and junior secondary schools and the central national school can also be properly configured with reference to local needs in order to obtain as much contact and convenience for further education as possible. In addition to the establishment of middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools in accordance with the regulations of the secondary school district, the establishment of schools and the addition of classes are gradually advanced with the following ratios as the goal: (1) Junior secondary schools: The ratio of the total number of classes in the three types of schools, junior middle schools, simple normal schools, and junior vocational schools, is 6:3:2. (2) Senior secondary schools: The ratio of the total number of classes in the three types of schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and senior vocational schools, is 2:1:1. The locations where various provinces and cities set up various types of secondary schools are mostly based on the following principles: 1. Senior high schools and junior high schools are located in areas with a dense population, prosperous economy, and convenient transportation. 2. Simple normal schools and normal schools are located in rural towns and cities. 3. Junior vocational schools and senior vocational schools: (A) All agricultural vocational schools are located in rural areas; (B) All industrial vocational schools are located in places where such occupations can be developed and improved, or are rich in such raw materials for manufacturing, or have such factories for internships; (C) All commercial vocational schools are located in more prosperous commercial cities; (D) The school sites of other vocational schools of various subjects are selected with an environment suitable for the subjects of the schools and convenient for internships. Junior middle schools, simple normal schools, and junior vocational schools are established by the county in principle. The provinces concentrate their efforts to run high schools or senior high schools, normal schools, and senior vocational schools jointly established by high schools and junior high schools. If only provincial junior high schools are set up in each middle school district in each province, they have mostly been changed to provincial senior high schools or provincial middle schools jointly established by high schools and junior high schools. If a senior high school or a senior high school jointly established by a high school and junior high school is already set up in the district, and a provincial junior high school is also set up at the same time, the provincial junior high school has been gradually changed to a normal school or a senior vocational school in consideration. If the provincial high school or the senior high school jointly established by the high school and junior high school, the normal school, and the senior vocational school have been established in the district, the provincial junior high school has mostly been gradually transferred to county management. The secondary schools of various types that were relocated and newly established by various provinces and cities after the war have been ordered to move back to their original locations, or remain at their current locations, or move to designated locations for proper adjustment in accordance with actual needs at the time of repatriation. In areas with too many middle schools, vocational schools have been designated to be converted in consideration of the circumstances, and private vocational schools have been supported and encouraged. Each county can first establish simple normal schools when adding county-run secondary schools in order to meet the urgent need for teachers in national education.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Middle School Stipulates Measures for Recommending Overseas Chinese Students</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News Agency] The Overseas Chinese Middle School affiliated to the Overseas Chinese College of Arts and Sciences in this city is a memorial school founded by overseas Chinese leaders in response to the offering of schools to celebrate birthdays. After the establishment of the school board, under the long-term planning of Chairman Liu Bo   , all school building internal equipment and filing matters have been completed one after another, and education expert Jiang Zhiyong, the former dean of the College of Science of National Jinan University, has been appointed as the principal of the school. Enrollment will begin immediately, and the school will officially open at the end of February. It is learned that in order to give preferential treatment to overseas Chinese students returning to China to study, it is stipulated that all overseas Chinese organizations in our country can recommend 10 students each for the junior and senior high school departments, and should have a transfer certificate, transcript, and certificate of recommendation from the school they attended abroad.</p>
<h3>Jieshou Establishes Parents' Association</h3>

<h3>The Ordnance Engineering College The Name Has Changed Four Times The Location Has Moved Three Times Now Is Heading Towards A New Life</h3>
<p>The name "Ordnance Engineering College" has only recently appeared, and many friends may feel unfamiliar when they see it. Let me tell you, friends, it is not unfamiliar at all. Its predecessor was the Hanyang Ordnance Vocational School, founded in the sixth year of the Republic of China. At that time, it was affiliated to the Hanyang Ordnance Factory, but it was suspended due to lack of funds. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China that it was transferred to the National Government before it reopened and recruited new students. It was later renamed the Ordnance Vocational School of the Ministry of Military Affairs and moved to outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China. Later, during the War of Resistance, it moved west to Yanggong Bridge in Chongqing. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Ordnance School of the Ministry of Military Affairs. After the victory of the war, the old school buildings were insufficient, and it was temporarily moved to Wusong, Shanghai. In early October of the thirty-sixth year, it was ordered to be renamed "Ordnance Engineering College". In thirty years, the name has changed four times, and the location has moved three times. The future permanent school site will be determined at Baishui Bridge outside Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing. There, the mountains and rivers are beautiful, and the environment is pleasant. The school buildings are currently under construction and will be moved there after completion. The Ordnance Engineering College is now heading towards a new life. Originally, there were only two departments, "Weapons Manufacturing" and "Applied Chemistry", but now "Tank Manufacturing Engineering" has been added, totaling three departments. The so-called "Weapons Manufacturing" is the study of the design and manufacture of various weapons. The so-called Applied Chemistry is the study of various applied chemical industries and the manufacture and development of toxic gases. As for Tank Manufacturing Engineering, it can be understood from the literal meaning. In short, the three departments stand together and attach equal importance to them, aiming to establish a solid foundation for the training of national defense industry talents.</p>
<p>The equipment of the Ordnance Engineering College has always been very complete, with a physics and chemistry building, a library, a printing house, and also an armory and a practice factory for students to conduct practical research. In addition, during the summer vacation, students can also enter domestic ordnance factories to live in the factory for internships and conduct further research.</p>
<p>Speaking of professors, they are all famous figures in the domestic education field. For example, during the Yanggong Bridge era, Lou Guanglai, Lu Zhihong, Zhang Hongyuan, Gao Jiyu, Sun Guangyuan, Zhang Jiangshu, Zhao Guohua, Ding Guanhai, Yan Yancun, and others who taught at the school were all knowledgeable scholars. Now, under the leadership of Zhao Guohua, Hui Shichu, and others, the lineup of professors is exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>We deeply know the importance of national defense, and the cultivation of national defense talents cannot be perfunctory. Moreover, the study of weapons theory cannot be entered by students with better grades, so the admission standards for ordnance are high, often thousands of people take the exam, but the number of admitted is not so numerous. Therefore, the new students admitted each time are of a high degree of tidiness. In addition, the school has a beautiful environment, professors teach seriously, and the equipment is complete, which cultivates a strong research atmosphere among the students. It is expected that many friends in Chongqing often remember: approaching Yanggong Bridge and entering the Ordnance School is like stepping into a monastery, with silence all around. If you approach the library or self-study room, they are all sitting together in a crowded hall, each one focused on studying carefully. Because of this, after four or five years of hard work, the students are slowly tempered, and they can cope with the work they take on after graduation. Since the Ordnance Engineering College was opened, although a total of only 345 students have graduated, there are indeed many who are currently holding important positions in the domestic ordnance industry. To be more specific, the most difficult public-funded study abroad program of the Ministry of Education is also listed among the graduates of Ordnance, such as Zhao Guohua's Boxer Indemnity for studying in the UK in the 28th year of the Republic of China, and Xu Jiesu's public-funded study in the United States last year. There are countless others who have been sent abroad for public or private study or inspection and practice. As far as I know, 14 of the 15 graduates of the Weapons Manufacturing Department in the 28th year of the Republic of China have been to the United States. Frankly speaking, few old alumni who graduated from ordnance have not drunk seawater.</p>
<p>In addition, it can also be informed that during the study period, all books, instruments, and clothing used by students are provided by the school, and there are also pocket money allowances. After graduation, the Ordnance Bureau distributes them to work in various ordnance factories. Therefore, students at the school do not have to worry about food and clothing, and can study with peace of mind. They also do not have to look for work themselves after graduation, so people say that this is an "iron rice bowl".</p>
<p>The Ordnance Engineering College usually recruits students during the summer vacation, but this year it is in the middle of the school relocation period, so it has only recently taken recruitment measures. This time, recruitment will be conducted in ten places across the country, including Guiyang, Wuchang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Taiwan, and Guangzhou. I sincerely welcome the admitted new students to participate in the research work of the ordnance industry together.</p>

<h3>Seven Battles, Seven Victories: Hua Lian Decisively Defeats Da Gong; 52 to 34, a Difference of 18 Points; Overly Tense, Da Gong's Performance is Subpar</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the first cycle of the Group A Basketball League, the championship battle between Hua Lian and Da Gong last night resulted in Hua Lian leading the entire way, achieving an absolute victory with a score of 52 to 34, a total difference of 18 points. The score at halftime was 18 to 11. Hua Lian has won seven battles and seven victories, while Da Gong has already suffered two defeats, and their hopes for the championship are dashed. If there are no changes in the future, it appears that Hua Lian will continue to hold the third championship trophy.</p>
<p>Last night's decisive battle attracted over 6,000 spectators. The gymnasium was packed, and ticket revenue reached over 200 million yuan, an unprecedented event in the league. Military police and constables worked together to maintain order. Shanghai and Victory Radio simultaneously broadcast the battlefield situation. The first cycle has come to an end, and Da Gong's revenge must wait until next week.</p>
<p>Hua Lian is a Notch Better than Da Gong</p>
<p>Due to emotional tension, there were times when [the audience] cheered in unison for both sides. The overall competition was quite fierce. Da Gong seemed to perform abnormally. Cai Wenhua was closely guarded by Li Zhenzhong and never managed to make a single basket, only earning three points from free throws, which was a reason for Da Gong's miserable defeat last night. The use of Zhan Chen at the start is a strategic decision worth considering. Tu Wenlong and Cai Zhongqiang were relatively weak and failed to coordinate with the three main players. There were many opportunities to shoot, but there were numerous misses. Rebounds under the basket all went to Hua Lian. These were all Da Gong's weaknesses.</p>
<p>Hua Lian maintained the upper hand throughout and was also more composed than Da Gong. Da Li Baosongyuan was the most outstanding, and Chen Xuechong also had occasional masterpieces. Wu Chengzhang was unparalleled in rebounding under the basket. Only Ren Xiangcheng and Liu Fushen were relatively weaker. Overall, Hua Lian's talents were well-rounded, and they were indeed a notch better than Da Gong.</p>
<p>Following the Situation From Beginning to End</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua opened the scoring with a successful free throw. From the start, they were at an advantage. Hua Lian had twelve points, while Da Gong had only three from free throws. Fei Boling replaced Zhan Chen, and only then did [Cai] Wenzhang and [Tu] Wenlong show some success. As Da Li's ball left his hand, the whistle blew, and the ball went into the basket. At halftime, Hua Lian led with 18 to 11.</p>
<p>In the second half, Hua Lian's Ren Xiangcheng replaced Liu Fushen. Cai Wenzhang scored two consecutive baskets, bringing the score to 18 to 15. It seemed that Da Gong had a chance to turn things around, and cheers erupted. Unfortunately, they failed to seize this golden opportunity to take it a step further. Wu Chengzhang and Bao Songyuan again scored, and Da Gong still trailed by four or five points. Cai Zhongqiang was replaced by Huang Boling, and the score gap widened. At the highest point, it was 49 to 28, a difference of 21 points. Cai Wenhua fouled out for the fifth time and left the field, hastily completing the remaining game. The final result was 52 to 34.</p>

<h3>Pre-Selection Team Captains Perform Plainly; Narrowly Defeat Western United 4-2; Two Penalty Kicks Scored in the Second Half</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai District team participating in the World Games football pre-selections, in order to test cooperation and warm up, played a practice match against the city's Western United team at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. Although the rain from the previous night had cleared, spectators were deterred, with only about 5,000 fans attending. Western United's attacks were particularly fierce. In the first half, the pre-selection team tied 1-1. In the second half, Western United scored another goal, taking a 2-1 lead. The pre-selection team scored three goals, turning defeat into victory, with a final score of 4-2.</p>
<p>The World Games team's morale was lacking, and they arrived late. The match only started at 2:55 PM. Only nine players from the representative team took the field. Yan Shixin had left Shanghai, Li Yichen missed the sign-in, and Fei Chunhua arrived only after the game started. Chen Jiawan was pulled into the game first, and Chen Jianyi bravely helped, making the situation even. Only when Fei Chunhua arrived were there eleven players.</p>
<p>Few Highlights, Western United Active</p>
<p>There were few highlights throughout the game. Wu Qixiang was the most stable. Meng Yiliang marked the small yellow-haired Roberts, playing three defenders, so the midfield line and the forwards were often disconnected. Adding to this, Han Longhai failed to stand out, further making the game lifeless. Sun Jinshun's skills were still sharp, but overall, he failed to meet the audience's expectations and still needs to work hard before going to Hong Kong. Western United had plenty of energy, with slightly weaker defenders, but excellent midfielders and forwards. Tiefu Ni marked Sun Tie Tui, Roberts remained a dangerous figure, and his goal was incredibly beautiful, glancing off the goalpost before going in. F. Edwards's speed was formidable, and Grinas was also commendable. The loss of their third and fourth goals were both from penalty kicks, and are not worth discussing. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>World Games Pre-Selection Team</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, Chen Jiawan, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Li [blank], Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Xia Tiguang, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Western United Team</p>
<p>Wen Ganno, Xu Erz, Lesbao, Hannipo, Tiefu Ni, Kapustin, Nogolov, F. Edwards, Roberts, Grinas (replaced by Salachin), Carlo Liequ</p>
<p>One Goal Each, Tie at Halftime</p>
<p>Referee: Wu Shouheng. The pre-selection team wore East China red jerseys, and Western United wore green, white, and blue jerseys. Lining up in the center circle, the pre-selection team had nine players. Gao Baozheng moved forward, taking the left wing. After the kickoff, a melee ensued. At six minutes, Sun Jinshun tried a shot in front of the goal, but it was saved by Wen Nuogan. Soon after, Long Hai did an overhead kick, but it was also unsuccessful. At fourteen minutes, Chen Jiawan entered the field in full gear, playing left back, and the pre-selection team's momentum surged. At fourteen minutes, Sun Jinshun received support from General Han and shot from close range, the ball going into the net, 1-0 to the pre-selection team. Two minutes later, Fei Chunhua arrived and joined the battle. At twenty minutes, Roberts went on a solo run, tying the score at 1-1. Halftime ended with the score tied at one goal each.</p>
<p>Two Penalty Kicks Missed</p>
<p>After halftime, the sides switched ends and the lineups remained unchanged. At six minutes, Roberts received a pass from Nogolov and scored with a powerful shot from close range, 2-1 to Western United. Frustrated, the pre-selection team concentrated their firepower, attacking fiercely on the front line. At nineteen minutes, Fei Chunhua took a corner kick from the right, and Li [blank] was in the right spot, striking with his foot and leveling the score at 2-2. Western United were unwilling to accept defeat and launched a major attack, but failed to score. At twenty-seven minutes, Salachin replaced Grinas. Two minutes later, Hannipo committed a handball in the penalty area, and Sun Jinshun took the penalty kick, successfully scoring and putting the pre-selection team back in the lead at 3-2. Afterwards, both sides were locked in a bitter struggle until one minute before the end of the game, when Xu Erz committed a handball 30 yards out. Old Sun tried his skills again, and again he was successful. Shortly afterwards, time ran out, and the pre-selection team narrowly defeated Western United 4-2.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Gangguang to Face Shantou Team Today; Match Tomorrow Changed to Jiaotong University</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Gangguang basketball team arrived in Shanghai last week, and the Basketball Committee scheduled five matches. Three matches have already been held, resulting in defeats to Green Forest, Chen You, and Topika. Today's fourth match will be against the Shantou team at 5 PM at the City Gymnasium, with tickets costing 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. Referees will be Wang Yiqiao and Yu [blank] Lu. The team's final match was originally scheduled to be against Hua Lian or Da Gong tomorrow, but at the request of the Jiaotong University basketball team, it was decided to change the match to Jiaotong University, with the consent of the Basketball Committee. The entire team will depart for Hangzhou on the 5th and return to Jiangxi Province. The trip to Nanjing was cancelled due to time constraints.</p>
<p>In the past three matches, the visiting team has suffered defeats due to relatively backward skills, but their performance has been improving daily. In the match against Topika the night before last, they led twice with 8-2 and 11-4. Today, facing the Shantou team, they will surely perform even better. Cai Yanxiong is returning to serve for the Shantou team today, adding to the original lineup of Ma Canxi, Chen Qingjiang, and He Lide. Victory is assured.</p>

<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Meets with Reporters; Discusses Current Economic Issues; Official-Merchant Cooperation Necessary for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management; Fuel Supply Adequate After Increased Production and Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs met with reporters at his residence yesterday and answered the questions raised by the reporters. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Issues: The government's goals for managing cotton yarn and cloth are twofold: first, to stabilize the prices of cotton yarn and cloth, and second, to promote the development of the [blank] industry. The management method is to implement unified purchase and unified sales, and substitute spinning and weaving. Six implementation rules have been drafted and have all been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and are awaiting promulgation and implementation. After the new method is formulated, it is bound to be implemented. The Shanghai private yarn factories, [blank] Department of Justice believes that it is difficult to implement, before the method is implemented, it is just speculation. Whether there are difficulties in implementing the method will only be known after implementation. If difficulties are encountered after implementation, the Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, Yuan, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs can be asked to consider ways to overcome the difficulties. However, the most important thing is that the fate of the yarn factories is the same as that of the government. Therefore, sincere cooperation is necessary to save the current crisis.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Supply Issue: Raw cotton can be obtained from the following three sources: (A) Purchase as much raw cotton as possible from production areas across the country. (B) Exchange raw cotton for export of cotton yarn and cloth. (C) Allocate a portion from US loans to purchase raw cotton. In addition to the above three sources, plus existing cotton stocks, it is believed that the supply of raw cotton will not be a problem for half a year.</p>
<p>Fuel Issue: The supply of fuel to the Beijing-Shanghai area has relied heavily on coal from the Northeast. We are now actively paying attention to: (A) Accumulating 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal in Shanghai. (B) Factories achieving self-sufficiency in coal. (C) Promoting increased coal production in various regions. From December 10th to January 20th of last year, when the supply of coal and rice from the north was disrupted, it was maintained by relying on existing stocks. In terms of increased production, the monthly output of Huainan and East China mines half a year ago was only 80,000 to 90,000 tons, but has now increased to 160,000 tons. After half a year of efforts, the coal production in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin is sufficient to meet the needs of the Yangtze River provinces themselves. However, there is a shortage of transportation, so I am trying to implement a regional self-sufficiency plan for each province. Currently, the coal reserves in Huainan, East China, and Xing coal mines total 180,000 tons, plus the adjustment and supply of Taiwanese coal, and the coal transportation from Kaiping has recently improved, so there will be no fundamental problem with fuel.</p>
<p>Price Issue: The government has always paid attention to the price issue. The management of cotton yarn and cloth, the establishment of the Financial Administration, the implementation of the comprehensive distribution plan, and the implementation of the procurement and ordering policy are all aimed at comprehensively stabilizing prices. The inspection of warehouses will be implemented if necessary. If there are price fluctuations before the Lunar New Year, the central government will have special measures to deal with them.</p>
<p>US Aid to China Issue: China's revival should first seek self-reliance. However, China has suffered eight years of war of resistance and two years of civil war. In addition to self-reliance during the revival, if we can obtain foreign aid, the revival process can be faster [blank]. Furthermore, US aid to us is also half [blank] self-help. The more aid we receive today, the lighter the burden on the United States regarding Far East issues in the future. Less aid today will mean a greater burden in the future. Objectively speaking, the total amount of US aid should be US$3 billion. US$1 billion for military aid, US$1 billion for balancing finances and currency system reform, and US$1 billion for economic reconstruction and construction. This amount can be allocated in stages according to needs and urgency.</p>
<p>Impressions of Hankou: The main task of my recent trip to Hankou was to inspect the affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the general situation in the local area. I deeply feel that the industrial situation in Hankou is no longer as prosperous as before the war. During the War of Resistance, the main industries in the rear, such as textiles, steel, etc., were all moved from Hankou. During the war, the supply of yarn, cloth, and steel to the rear was very significant. Although it is impossible to move them all back after the victory, Hubei Province is still not short of industries that can be developed. The most prominent ones are cotton spinning, steel, machinery, oil, and chemical industries. Regarding the fuel issue, Hubei Province relied on the Liuhe [blank] and Jiaozuo [blank] before the war. As a result of increased production of anthracite coal in the province, there is a surplus that can be supplied to other provinces. The general pain of the industrial and commercial circles in Hankou is threefold: (A) Unstable situation, (B) Shortage of funds, (C) Factory equipment has not been restored to its pre-war state. The government should provide assistance within its means to help solve these problems. However, I also deeply hope that the industrial and commercial circles in Hankou, in addition to focusing on agriculture and commerce, should also pay attention to the development of industry to increase the importance of Wuhan.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Cotton Spinning Associations from Six Districts Continue to Discuss Details</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Complying with the instructions of Chairman Yuan of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, the Cotton Spinning Associations of the six districts have appointed five representatives, Liu Piji, Tong Runfu, Tang Huaru, Han Zhiming, and Bu Shihut, to continue discussing the details with Director Liu Wenteng and Director Gao Bingtai of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee today.</p>
<h3>Unrest in Lu and Yu; Tobacco Merchants Purchase Yunnan Tobacco</h3>
<p>Tobacco merchants in this city mainly purchase tobacco leaves from Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Due to the chaotic situation in Shandong, the southward transportation of Qingzhou tobacco leaves has been greatly hindered. In Henan, Xuchang has been harassed by communist bandits in recent months, resulting in the interruption of supply. As for the Anhui area, the stagnation of transportation has made it inevitable for tobacco merchants to increase costs and face various inconveniences when purchasing. For this reason, tobacco merchants have recently shifted their focus to purchasing Yunnan tobacco leaves. Many tobacco merchants have sent special personnel to Yunnan, as the situation in the southwestern provinces is stable, providing greater safety and certainty for business and travel. If the situation in Shandong, Henan, and other places does not clear up, Yunnan tobacco leaves will soon become the main source of raw materials for the cigarette industry in this city.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] American tobacco in our country has been planted in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces, with the widest range and best results. The quality of the tobacco produced is several times better than that of local tobacco. Therefore, the domestic American tobacco produced over the years has been able to replace part of the imported American tobacco and has become an important source for our country's cigarette industry. During the War of Resistance, most of the industrial and commercial enterprises moved to the interior with the government, and the cigarette industry also actively developed in various parts of the southwest. In order to facilitate the supply of raw materials, various parts of Yunnan Province also extensively planted American tobacco. With the keen advocacy of various relevant agencies, great results have been achieved. The quality is excellent, and the output is abundant. In addition to supplying local cigarette factories, it is also sold to various parts of the country. The planting of American tobacco in Yunnan Province has become one of the major American tobacco producing areas in our country.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Registration of Flammable Liquid Manufacturers at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The police department received a letter from the city Chamber of Commerce stating that the original extension period for the registration of flammable liquid manufacturers was only one month, which was still too short, and requested that it be extended further. After consideration, the police department believes that the application registration procedure for flammable liquids is very simple and differs from the issuance of permits, which requires investigation and review. It has agreed to extend the deadline to the end of February 1937.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Siamese Remittances; The Evolution and Speculation of Siamese Remittances</h3>
<p>By Liu Zuoren</p>
<p>Although the amount of remittances from Siam each year is so large, due to the lack of branches of our government banks in Siam and the lack of appropriate policies for absorbing remittances, they are all remitted by private banks. In addition, the gap between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate has widened, which has intensified the trend of remittance evasion. Private banks are organized by individuals or private groups, so they naturally only seek profit. In the past, self-respecting banks were able to specialize in remittance business, but because the national currency could not escape the fate of gradual decline, they gradually turned to financial speculation. Being keen on forward exchange transactions is also a way for overseas Chinese to remit funds, but unlike remittances, which are almost 90% or more used to support families, forward exchange transactions are large amounts remitted back to the hometown to build properties or to Shantou for high-interest loans, which also contain productive operations. However, because the banks themselves only value "forward," other hot money also joins the battle, forming financial speculation. "Shorting" becomes a trend. As long as the forward bill is cheap, everyone is happy to take action, regardless of credit. Therefore, the crisis is bred in this situation.</p>
<p>The so-called forward exchange transaction means receiving a certain amount of Siamese baht in Siam and stipulating that a certain amount of national currency will be delivered in Shantou within ten days. For example, the average forward price in January was 42 baht per 10,000 yuan of national currency, which means that paying 42 baht in Siam can receive 10,000 yuan of national currency in Shantou. Because the forward price is gradually decreasing, it has stimulated the speculative psychology of the general banks, and the market vision has also focused on this one industry. The general psychology is "every receipt will make a profit, even a blind man can place an order," and there is no need for any expertise or insight. Therefore, Zhang San and Li Si come to organize silver credit bureaus and exchange shops, all boasting "credit guarantees" or "fast remittances." The price does not need to know the market, anyway, the outlook is bearish.</p>
<p>Especially in late June of last year, it was the peak period of forward exchange transactions. At that time, the Ocean Shipping Company had the largest trading volume, and the price was often ahead of the general private exchange industry, thinking it was the secret to absorption. For example, in late June, the settlement price of the forward exchange of the private exchange industry was 4.50 to 4.60 baht, while the Ocean Shipping Company only received 4.00 to 4.25 baht. Therefore, at that time, the forward orders released by the company were mostly interbank bills. The general banks absorbed a large amount from the Ocean Shipping Company or other second-rate brands, and then transferred and released them, deducting a small profit. This is tantamount to using its own reputation as a gambling stake, bearing the responsibility for all "fire." The unlimited short-selling of the Ocean Shipping Company and other short-sellers used to be successful for a period of time, but because after Weitmeyer arrived in China on July 22, the US dollar in Shanghai quickly fell, and the Siamese Shantou exchange rate gradually rose. The Shantou exchange rate immediately rebounded to above 6 baht, so the sellers were desperate. The Ocean Shipping Company and others went bankrupt one after another, with a total amount of about 40 billion yuan, of which the Ocean Shipping Company alone reached more than 20 billion yuan, equivalent to about 20 million baht, accounting for almost one-twentieth of the total Siamese remittances.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be said that the unprecedented unfortunate collapse of Siamese remittances last year was actually due to the self-destruction of Siamese banks, using blind price cuts as a competitive means, which resulted in a dangerous result. It is a lesson worth our vigilance.</p>
<p>Ways to Fight for Siamese Remittances</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that although the remittances from Siam are huge, the lack of correct and appropriate policies for remittances has led to the inflow of remittances into the black market, and the inflow of remittances into speculation has caused the collapse, which has caused direct damage to overseas Chinese and affected the absorption of remittances in the future. Therefore, appropriate improvements must be made in response to the current situation. The main problems that need to be improved urgently are the following:</p>
<p>First: Get as close as possible to the black market exchange rate to eliminate the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate, so that remittances will not be evaded into the black market due to the huge losses caused by the official exchange rate. The level of the exchange rate is closely related to the country's financial policy and monetary system. Although this is a matter of the country's entire economic, financial, and monetary policy, because of the existence of the black market, the government seems to have to take into account the interests of overseas Chinese, that is, the amount of national currency collected and exchanged from overseas Chinese should be converted at the market price as much as possible. Otherwise, the profit will inevitably lead to remittances evading Hong Kong. If the list price cannot be changed arbitrarily, a subsidy policy should also be adopted, and the amount of the subsidy should be increased at any time to approach or not be lower than the black market exchange rate.</p>
<p>Second: Widely establish remittance absorption agencies and strengthen contact with remittance bureaus. Because the overseas Chinese residing in Siam, unlike the overseas Chinese in North and South America, are concentrated in big cities, but are scattered in various rural areas and small towns, branches of national banks should be established not only in large cities in Siam such as Bangkok, but also in other important cities such as Chiang Mai and Hepu. In four or five cities, establish national banking institutions to universally absorb remittances. In order to fully grasp all remittances, so as to prevent remittances from flowing into the black market and the [blank] calculation of the machine, it is still necessary to closely contact the remittance bureaus in various parts of Siam. The method is that all remittances received by the bureau are remitted by our banks at the black market exchange rate, or transferred to Hong Kong by the bank. In this way, all foreign exchange can fall into the hands of our banks. Not only can the government control the remittances, but also because the remittances will not flow into the black market, it will reduce the adverse effects of the black market foreign exchange on the country's economy and finance.</p>
<p>Third: For institutions that absorb remittances abroad, they should be widely established. In the hometowns of overseas Chinese in China, such as Shantou and Haikou, remittance agencies should also be added, and cash should be prepared as much as possible, so that overseas Chinese can obtain cash on the spot without having to find a guarantor and fail to obtain cash. And to provide various services to overseas Chinese, such as writing letters, transmitting news, designing, answering questions, and small loans to overseas Chinese families, so as to connect with overseas Chinese, remittances will inevitably increase day by day.

<h3>Central Trust Bureau Announces Recent Tung Oil and Bristle Market Conditions: Bristle Prices Stable, Tung Oil Prices Suppressed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Trust Bureau announced yesterday the tung oil and bristle market conditions from January 26th to the [blank] day as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Oil: Due to the announcement of new warehousing rules in New York and the US government's investigation into China's dumping of tung oil in the US, the foreign market price was affected. US buyers have hesitated because the US government's investigation may result in tariffs. The New York spot price has fallen from US$0.2575 per pound to US$0.25. On the other hand, domestic cargo owners are eager to sell due to the need for capital turnover, and prices have also been suppressed. Currently, loose oil CIF New York is only US$0.2425 per [blank], and barrel oil CIF London is GBP 182.5 per long ton, with very few transactions. Domestic oil prices: In Shanghai, due to tight credit, although the US exchange rate has increased by 6,000 yuan, it is still stuck at around 2.95 million yuan per city dan. Chongqing: 1,975,000 yuan. Hankou: 2,800,000 yuan. Wanxian: 2,010,000 yuan. [Blank] Zhou: 2,6000,000 yuan. Guangzhou: 2,975,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bristles: This week, foreign bristle prices are still [blank]. Chongqing No. 27 black mixed bristles CIF New York is US$2.20 per pound, London is 14 shillings and 6 pence. Han No. 17 black mixed bristles CIF New York is US$3.2 per pound, Shanghai bristles are 2.20 yuan, and Tianjin small No. 55 black mixed bristles are 5.05 yuan. There have been slight transactions. Domestic prices: Chongqing bristles are 38 million yuan per [blank] dan. Hankou bristles are 50.5 million yuan. Shanghai bristles are 40 million yuan. Tianjin small No. 55 bristles are 81.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Direct Tax Bureau Urges Payment of Income Tax for Qian Industry</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Finance had previously set the deadline for reporting the special business income tax for the second half of the 36th year of the Republic of China for the city's silver, money, and trust industries to be the end of January of this year. It is now reported that some firms in the industry have not yet submitted their reports completely. Therefore, a responsible person from the Direct Tax Bureau recently contacted the Bankers Association, hoping they would urge their members to report as soon as possible to facilitate collection. It is said that the industry association has already notified its members accordingly.</p>
<h3>Revision of Internal Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The internal exchange rates for the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be adjusted separately from February 2nd as follows: Quanzhou, Fujian, 140 yuan (originally 120 yuan). Guangzhou, 50 yuan (originally 70 yuan). Hankou-Wuchang, 30 yuan (originally 50 yuan). Shashi-Yichang, 60 yuan (originally 100 yuan). Jiujiang, 30 yuan (originally 40 yuan). Ji'an, 40 yuan (originally 50 yuan). Ganzhou, 50 yuan (originally 60 yuan). Wenzhou, 60 yuan (originally 70 yuan). Chongqing-Chengdu, 10 yuan (originally 5 yuan). Yunnan, 8 yuan (originally 2 yuan).</p>
<h3>Review of Manufacturers' Finished Products for Purchase Begins Today</h3>
<p>The national banks and bureaus, under orders to purchase finished products from manufacturers, have begun accepting applications. Many have been obtaining application forms and inquiring about procedures in recent days. Dozens of firms, including cotton textile businesses, have formally submitted applications. After initial review by each bank and bureau, the applications will be forwarded to the Shanghai branch of the Joint Board of Four Banks for final review and decision. Then, the bank or bureau handling the purchase will issue a check from the Central Bank as payment. It is reported that the Shanghai branch of the Joint Board of Four Banks will begin reviewing the first batch of application forms today, aiming to purchase some finished products before the Lunar New Year to alleviate the financial difficulties of manufacturers. The Joint Board of Four Banks has specially dispatched the head of the loan department, Mr. Qiang, to Shanghai to assist in the process.</p>

<h3>The Contributions of Atomic Energy in Peacetime</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qu Sou</p>
<p>While the issue of international atomic energy control remains unresolved, many have discussed the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. This article, written by Waccemar Kaempffert, the renowned science editor of the New York Times, provides a detailed review of the contributions and potential uses of atomic energy in peacetime. The original article was published in the October issue of Survey Graphic magazine. - Translator</p>
<p>It has been over two years since the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The immense power of the atomic bombs astonished not only the general public but also the scientists who created them. Humanity, with its boundless capabilities, had finally reached the point of releasing atomic energy. Imaginative individuals predicted that vehicles on roads and airplanes in the sky would soon be powered by atomic energy, and that entire cities could obtain their power from a pound or two of uranium. It seemed as though a utopian world powered by atomic energy was just around the corner, where humanity would no longer be concerned about fuel prices and could use extremely cheap atomic energy.</p>
<p>However, the prices of various fuels in the market have not plummeted as a result, and many power plants are instead ordering new steam boilers and generators to replace their old machines. One might ask, what is going on?</p>
<p>What is the extent of atomic energy's contribution to peaceful applications? Will the use of atomic energy trigger another industrial revolution for humanity? This is a question many are eager to know. From the perspective of most mechanical engineers, factories using atomic energy in large cities could serve as regular factories, or be used to generate power in areas where fuel is particularly scarce and expensive, but they are not likely to replace coal and oil altogether. This is because modern coal-burning machines used in factories today have already achieved very high efficiency, requiring only an average of one pound of coal to generate one horsepower per hour. Therefore, in many large cities in the United States, it costs only three to five cents (USD) to use one kilowatt-hour of electricity. In reality, the fuel needed for a power plant to produce one kilowatt-hour of electricity costs only two to five tenths of a cent (USD) at most. The majority of other expenses are related to electricity transmission, company management, meter reading, accounting, and other items. These expenses cannot be avoided even in the age of atomic energy. Therefore, any new raw material that can generate power must compete within the five-tenth-of-a-cent (USD) range of fuel costs to compete with coal and oil. In areas where hydroelectric power is used, atomic energy is even less viable, because the water provided by nature does not cost a single cent and is inexhaustible. Meanwhile, pure "Uranium-238" costs at least twenty dollars a pound, and the rare "Uranium-235," used to make atomic bombs, costs at least seven thousand dollars a pound, or even over ten thousand dollars a pound. Some optimistic proponents of atomic energy argue that although the price of uranium is high, one pound of pure Uranium-235, about the size of a golf ball, can produce the equivalent energy of 1,500 tons of coal, 250,000 gallons of gasoline, 80 million cubic feet of coal gas, or 400 million cubic feet of natural gas. However, even with this calculation, the benefits are minimal.</p>
<p>People who do not understand the principles of atomic energy often think that we can easily use atomic energy directly to provide electricity and heat to homes. In reality, this is as difficult as trying to power a train with lightning. Let's briefly describe the principle of using atomic energy before mentioning its difficulties.</p>
<p>The atoms of rare Uranium-235 must be bombarded by neutrons to split, and after splitting, more neutrons are released, bombarding other atoms of Uranium-235 and Uranium-238. Uranium-235 splits after being bombarded, while Uranium-238 gains neutrons and becomes Plutonium, which can be used as an explosive or as a source of electricity in power plants. The heat generated by this chain reaction is based on the same principle as the heat generated by constantly hammering a piece of iron. In the atomic bomb factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, this heat is simply released into the air. Another atomic bomb factory in Hanford, Washington, releases the heat into the Columbia River, increasing the river's temperature by only a small amount, but the heat is still astonishing. Many American mechanical engineers have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with this massive waste. The U.S. Department of War has expressed great regret about this, as they focused all their efforts on manufacturing atomic bombs during the war and did not consider this aspect. Currently, an aircraft parts factory in Oak Ridge is experimenting with using the heat released during atomic bombardment. Until official reports and required costs are published, all statements made by scientists about using atomic energy to generate power are merely speculations, many of which are overly imaginative.</p>
<p>If we could directly channel the heat released during atomic bombardment to steam turbines, or use it to heat water and generate steam to power machines, then the boiler equipment in our power plants would naturally be different from what it is today. However, everything else outside the boiler room would remain the same. Our transmission lines, substations, meters, lights, streetcars, and various electrical appliances would not need to be changed. Therefore, the first thing we can be certain of is that our lifestyles and other social elements will not change after using atomic energy, and it will not create a social revolution.</p>
<p>In terms of economics, according to surveys and statistics from the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, it would currently cost 25 million USD to build an atomic power plant with a generating capacity of 75,000 kilowatts in the eastern United States. Building a coal-fired power plant with the same capacity in the same location would cost at most 10 million USD. Furthermore, the uranium used in the atomic power plant would also require a large capital investment, perhaps several million USD.</p>
<p>This comparison by the Atomic Energy Commission does not yet include all the technical difficulties in using atomic energy to generate electricity. The most important of these is the issue of radioactivity. We all know that the rays emitted by X-rays have great power, and humans cannot be directly exposed to them. However, the radiation emitted by a "uranium pile"—a square arrangement of uranium rods placed in graphite—used in atomic power generation is even more unimaginably powerful. Therefore, even the smallest atomic power plant would need a furnace with five-foot-thick walls made of fifty tons of steel and concrete. No one can approach this "pile" while it is in operation, and used rods must be removed and replaced with new ones using remote control methods. This work has been done very carefully in the atomic bomb factories in Oak Ridge and Hanford, so no one has been injured so far. However, doing this in every ordinary atomic power plant is another matter.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are many other problems that need to be solved, and huge capital investments must be made for research. The most important thing is to prevent the radiation from affecting the water that needs to be heated. When using atomic energy as fuel for heating, a liquid is passed through a pipe that is heated by the high heat produced by atomic fission. This pipe must be made of a suitable material of appropriate thickness and must be absolutely leak-proof. If even a trace of water vapor leaks from the pipe, the danger is unimaginable. The atomic bombs that exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed many Japanese people, many of whom were not directly killed by the blast but died from exposure to radioactive rays, which destroyed their white blood cells and caused blood to seep out from under their skin. Therefore, working in a factory that uses atomic energy is very dangerous without extremely careful control and inspection. Water contaminated by radioactive rays cannot be discharged into ordinary waterways, otherwise the entire river will be affected. Even a rat killed by radiation cannot be buried immediately. If it is buried in the soil, it will affect the soil. If, unfortunately, other animals dig up the rat after loosening the soil, the danger is even greater.</p>
<p>In short, the problem of defending against radiation must first be solved before humanity can utilize atomic energy. It is because of this problem that our ideal of cars and airplanes powered by atomic energy is difficult to realize. Only in large ocean liners can uranium be used advantageously as a power source, because a large boiler weighing fifty tons can be installed on a large ocean liner without adverse effects. If a ship were to use uranium as fuel, it could travel millions of miles after being loaded once, without needing to refuel. Therefore, the space used to store oil or coal could be used for other purposes. Therefore, the use of atomic energy is extremely beneficial for naval architects, who can install larger turbines on ships to achieve higher speeds and install thicker armor on warships. The United Kingdom and the United States are now considering building large warships powered by atomic energy. If the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission allows it, shipping companies operating in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans will also plan to build faster atomic-powered ocean liners than the Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary of today.

<h3>Sex Determination of Offspring from Single-Female Reproduction</h3>
<p>— Xie Yeying</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>In organisms with sexual differentiation, fertilization seems to be a necessary condition for producing offspring. If a mature egg does not have the opportunity to be fertilized, it inevitably withers and disappears. While this is generally the case, it is not absolute. In plants and animals, there are some species whose eggs can produce offspring without fertilization. This reproductive method is biologically termed parthenogenesis, also known as virgin birth. Specifically, parthenogenesis is a type of sexual reproduction in which eggs develop without being fertilized. (Parthenogenesis in a mode of sexual reproduction in which ova develop without leinge ferilixed) Although this development is asexual, it actually originates from the female reproductive cells of sexually differentiated organisms. Therefore, it cannot be confused with asexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Many examples of parthenogenesis have been found in both animals and plants. In plants, these include water molds (Saprolegniae), stoneworts (Cnara), ferns, wintersweet, dandelion, sow thistle, Datura of the Solanaceae family, tobacco, and wheat of the Gramineae family. In animals, it is even more common, such as rotifers, water fleas of the Cladocera order, honeybees, aphids, stick insects, etc. Upon closer observation, the conditions of parthenogenesis in various animals and plants are actually very complex. In animals, parthenogenesis can be broadly divided into two categories:</p>
<p>True parthenogenesis: The eggs that undergo parthenogenesis either undergo meiosis, resulting in a haploid chromosome number (e.g., honeybees, scale insects), or do not undergo meiosis, resulting in a diploid chromosome number (e.g., armored scale insects, stick insects, rotifers, water fleas).</p>
<p>False parthenogenesis: This is a sham form of parthenogenesis. Although the egg is not fertilized, the egg nucleus often fuses with the nucleus of another cell (e.g., a polar body) before it begins to divide. Alternatively, the egg nucleus divides into two and then fuses back together.</p>
<p>In plants, parthenogenesis can be broadly divided into three categories:</p>
<p>Parthenogenesis: The egg develops into a sporophyte plant without fertilization, as seen in Datura, tobacco, sow thistle, etc. In this category, the egg may undergo meiosis, resulting in a haploid chromosome number, or not undergo meiosis, resulting in a diploid chromosome number.</p>
<p>Apogamy: Cells other than the egg cell, such as synergid cells or antipodal cells, can sometimes form an embryo without fusing with other cells, as is often seen in ferns and clubmosses.</p>
<p>Apospory: Cells other than spores develop into prothallia with archegonia and antheridia, as is commonly seen in mosses and ferns.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, parthenogenesis should be limited to cases where the egg can develop into offspring independently without fertilization. Needless to say, animal false parthenogenesis and plant apogamy and apospory are not within the scope of the discussion in this article. Moreover, in plants, the sporophyte generation (asexual generation) is not a suitable model for explaining the sex determination of parthenogenetically produced offspring. Therefore, we must focus on the animal aspect of the discussion, which should be stated beforehand.</p>
<p>Today, we not only know that some species in the animal kingdom naturally reproduce through parthenogenesis (Note 1), but also, through the actual research of many biologists, we have discovered that unfertilized eggs can be induced to undergo parthenogenesis using artificial methods and physical and chemical stimuli. The former is called natural parthenogenesis, and the latter is called artificial parthenogenesis. Natural parthenogenesis is commonly seen in field mites and insects of the Arthropoda phylum, and rotifers of the Rotifera phylum. In echinoderms, annelids, and other animals, artificial methods can be used to induce the development of eggs (Note 2), but the results are not as good as those of natural parthenogenesis.</p>
<p>Do offspring produced through parthenogenesis have sexual differentiation? Are they male or female? What are the reasons for the formation of female or male offspring? These are the questions that will be discussed in detail below.</p>
<p>(II) Natural Parthenogenesis and the Sex of Offspring</p>
<p>Offspring produced through natural parthenogenesis exhibit sexual differentiation, but the sex of these offspring always varies depending on the animal species. Some species can only produce male offspring, some can only produce female offspring, and some can produce both female and male offspring. Therefore, based on the sex of the offspring produced, parthenogenesis can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p>Arrhenotoky: The offspring produced are all male, such as honeybees, ants, and wasps.</p>
<p>Thelytoky: The offspring produced are all female, such as armored scale insects, stick insects, Solenobia, Bcelloicesi among rotifers, and Cimbax connata and Cimbax ovata among sawflies.</p>
<p>Deuterotoky: The offspring produced can be either male or female, such as gall wasps, aphids, water fleas, and rotifers.</p>
<p>Why do some species produce male offspring, some produce female offspring, and some produce both male and female offspring as a result of the independent development of unfertilized eggs? This is not only a question of developmental biology but also a question of cytology and genetics. We must not only find the factual basis for them in developmental biology but also delve into the causes in cytology and genetics. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Soundless Sound</h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>Sound in our minds is nothing more than beautiful singing, pleasant conversations, heroic bugle calls, and noisy market sounds... However, scientists say that sound can be used to kill germs, sterilize, dissipate smoke and fog, explore submarines, promote chemical changes, and replace surgery. It's truly incredible!</p>
<p>Supersonic Waves</p>
<p>Originally, sound is simply the vibration of objects. Human ears can perceive vibrations from sixteen to sixteen thousand times per second. Sounds exceeding this limit are inaudible. However, animals like bats and pigeons have higher perceptual functions, and they can hear some sounds that we cannot hear.</p>
<p>By using electric current or magnetism to vibrate quartz crystals, we can produce these vibrations of more than sixteen thousand times per second, which are called supersonic waves.</p>
<p>Deathly Sound</p>
<p>Dr. Mantner is a famous expert in supersonic waves. The doctor used a wave-quartz oscillator to generate sound waves vibrating at ten million times per second, which were focused and emitted through a parabolic mirror, reaching a rabbit cage 150 yards away. After five seconds, the rabbit was completely paralyzed and lost all sensation.</p>
<p>Sterilization experiments at the University of California found that streptococci are easily killed by supersonic waves. Therefore, milk that originally needed to be heated for half an hour to sterilize only needs to be exposed to supersonic waves for a few seconds to be completely sterilized.</p>
<p>Exploring Submarines</p>
<p>As early as twenty years ago, the doctor had already installed the first exploration instrument on a French submarine, using the reflection of supersonic waves to detect reefs, enemy ships, and oil rocks. The radar invented during this war is completely based on the same principle, except that it uses radio waves instead of supersonic waves.</p>
<p>The metal thickness gauge recently produced in the United States can measure the thickness and hardness of a metal plate from one side (the other side cannot be seen or touched) simply and conveniently, like X-ray magic. It is quite useful in the manufacturing and inspection of metal products, machinery, and boilers. This thickness gauge (Sonigage) is also a use of supersonic waves.</p>
<p>Clearing Clouds and Fog</p>
<p>When air is vibrated by supersonic waves, fine particles of dust and moisture are stimulated and gather together, condensing into large particles, and finally smoke dissipates and fog disperses. Therefore, airports and industrial areas can install supersonic wave machines on roofs on a large scale to drive away thick fog and purify the air, ensuring the safety of navigation and the health of residents.</p>
<p>Removing Brain Tumors</p>
<p>According to a report from the Columbia University Research Laboratory, germs of typhoid fever, colds, and polio can be killed by supersonic waves and then used as vaccines for inoculation. Hormones that do not dissolve in water can be made into emulsions using the vibration of supersonic waves and then injected into the human body to exert their medicinal power. A promising point is that supersonic waves can replace surgery to remove brain tumors. After determining the location, two sound waves can be crossed and directed onto the tumor, which may eliminate the cancer cells or limit their activity. If the experiment is successful, the contribution of supersonic waves will become increasingly significant.</p>
<p>Scientific Discussion</p>
<h3>Supplementary Opinions on Digital Segmentation</h3>
<p>— Huang Baihong</p>
<p>In the 23rd issue of this publication, Mr. Kong Fanqing discussed the issue of digital segmentation, and he raised questions about Mr. Zhou Shimin's article on the Sinicization of digital segmentation in the 21st issue. I have not seen Mr. Zhou's article in the 21st issue, but I agree with Mr. Kong's proposal.</p>
<p>In fact, three-digit segmentation has become a global convention. Now all academic systems tend towards internationalization. What is already popular in various countries should be adopted by us, and we cannot and should not be different from others. This is the same as adopting the Gregorian calendar, changing weights and measures to the metric system, adding punctuation marks to official documents, and consistently using Arabic numerals 12345... This is not Westernization, but seeking our own convenience. However, there are points that Mr. Kong has not clarified, and I would like to supplement them:</p>
<p>According to Western numbering methods, the common highest unit is "thousand" (the fourth digit), while in Chinese folklore, the common highest unit is "ten thousand" (the fifth digit). (Western methods only have ten thousand, but no ten thousand.) Therefore, they always use three-digit segmentation, while in China, it seems that four-digit segmentation should be more reasonable (perhaps this is what Mr. Zhou saw). However, after checking various domestic books, newspapers, and forms, the arrangement of numbers is "mostly according to three-digit segmentation. As a result, the notation and the pronunciation are inconsistent. Every time one sees a number, one must silently count one-ten-hundred-thousand to pronounce it, which really loses the meaning of segmentation. Since three-digit segmentation has already been adopted in fact, then it is necessary to change the commonly used highest unit to the upper digit of three digits (the fourth digit) or the upper digit of the multiple of three digits (the seventh digit). However, canceling ten thousand (the fifth digit) does not conform to Chinese customs, so we can only rise to hundred million, trillion, and trillion is the seventh digit, so we will promote trillion as the commonly used highest unit. At the same time, we must determine that ten thousand, hundred million, and trillion are decimal, that is, ten ten thousands are one hundred million, and ten hundred millions are one trillion. For example, four hundred and fifty million compatriots should be renamed four hundred and fifty trillion compatriots, and Shanghai's three million and five hundred thousand population should be called three trillion and five hundred million population. Wouldn't this be simpler? If three-digit segmentation is done in this way, the first section starts with the ones digit, the second section starts with the thousands digit, and the third section starts with the trillion digit. You can call it out at a glance without having to silently count digit by digit. Isn't this a solution to all problems?</p>
<p>As for digits above the trillion, because they are not commonly used units, if we still adopt a decimal system, there will be too many names and it will be difficult to remember. Therefore, we should still use the internationally accepted thousand system, that is, every thousand digits start a new naming, such as ten trillion, hundred trillion, quadrillion, ten quadrillion, hundred quadrillion, quintillion, etc. This is naturally still consistent with the three-digit segmentation system.</p>
<p>I published an article entitled "My Views on Arithmetic Naming and Segmentation" in the sixth issue of the first volume of World Monthly, and also published an article entitled "Handling Hundred Millions and Trillions" in the New People's Evening News on November 17 last year, both advocating this view. I hope that domestic experts will further educate us.</p>

<h3>On Retreating from Office</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Even a sage like Confucius did not shy away from saying, "He who excels in learning can become an official." He did not consider it shameful to seek office. No wonder that later generations of scholars, almost without exception, diligently toil through "ten years of cold window," enduring the hardship of "grinding through inkstones," hoping to realize their ambition of "learning the art of governing the world and selling it to the emperor." Thus, becoming an official has become a matter of course for scholars throughout history, and not becoming an official is an "exception."</p>
<p>Naturally, those who are unwilling or afraid to become officials mostly have unavoidable reasons. Especially in autocratic dynasties, the emperor held the power of life and death in his hands. Therefore, a small number of scholars who loved freedom or were not forced by poverty regarded becoming an official as a dangerous path. For example, Tao Yuanming of the Jin Dynasty was unwilling to bow for five pecks of rice and would rather go home to eat old rice, living a leisurely life of "picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence and leisurely seeing the Southern Mountain." Yan Guang of the Han Dynasty, even though his friendship and relationship with Liu Xiu were not shallow, would rather stay by the Fuchun River fishing for the rest of his life. There is also a more humorous story, as recorded in the "Hou Qing Lu," about Yang Pu, a Song Dynasty man who was unwilling to become an official:</p>
<p>"When Emperor Zhenzong performed the eastern sacrifice, he sought out hermits from all over the country and found Yang Pu from Qi, who could write poetry. He was summoned to an audience and claimed he could not. The emperor asked, 'Did anyone write a poem to send you off before you left?' Pu said, 'Only my wife had a poem: "Stop getting drunk and indulging in wine, and stop being wildly fond of writing poetry; today you are being taken to the government office, this time you will lose your old head." ' The emperor laughed and let him return to the mountain."</p>
<p>If Yang Pu considered becoming an official as losing his old head, it shows that becoming an official is something that can be done or not done. Unfortunately, those who are enthusiastic consider this a great undertaking of "honoring ancestors and brightening the family," so the number of people who think of it as "losing their old head" is even fewer, and they are worshiped by later generations as hermits with lofty character.</p>
<p>Today, when the country is owned by the people, officials have become the people's "public servants." Moreover, the golden age of being an official has passed. Looking at the actual lives of those poor civil servants struggling in hunger and cold, it is not difficult to know the pitiful situation of officials. However, even so, the traditional atmosphere of "he who excels in learning can become an official" does not seem to have changed much with the times. Therefore, the path of becoming an official is still a place where the majority of intellectuals compete for. In the circle of officials, there is also a great surplus of people. Those who can become officials but are unwilling or afraid to do so can naturally still be regarded as "exceptional" people. I have two friends who are unwilling or afraid to become officials:</p>
<p>One is a liberal arts student who originally made a living teaching. Later, he was pulled by another friend to help and once served as the district chief of a municipal city. This is an official close to the people. This brother quietly resigned in less than three months and went back to his old profession. Afterwards, when asked about the reason for his resignation, he said with great emotion: "How could I continue! Whether people know me or not, whenever they meet me, they don't ask about my political achievements or how difficult things are, but always raise their thumbs or pat my shoulder and say, 'This time, brother, you must have a way!' " This so-called "have a way" means "make a fortune." If this continues, a big tree attracts the wind. Corruption is not my forte, and not being corrupt will give me a bad name! After thinking it over, I decided to quit."</p>
<p>The other is a top scorer in the college entrance examination. The chairman of a certain province somehow favored him and repeatedly hinted that he should choose the best county to be a county magistrate. However, after repeated consideration, he still declined the chairman's kind "cultivation." According to him, in this era, it is still easy to control oneself from being corrupt, but it is very difficult to control others. If I do it, there will inevitably be problems!"</p>
<p>Based on this, the motives of my two friends for being unwilling or afraid to become officials are certainly not related to being "hermits" or seeking fame and reputation. However, their words are worth pondering. Of course, "the pure are naturally pure" and "the impure are naturally impure." A person's character and integrity are clearly defined. Moreover, there are certainly "tough guys" who "emerge from the mud without being stained." It is a pity that under the turbulent waves of the muddy current, it is not easy for the pure current to be the pillar of the river. Therefore, some people can only step back and retreat.</p>
<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
<p>— Ji Shui</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Liang Qichao in his article "The Most Painful and the Most Joyful," the last paragraph has persuaded people to taste the cold water in winter, and how cold it is, this is the so-called "personal experience."</p>
<p>Only personal experience is the most real. Great sympathy is also produced in these four plain words. This time, the Shen Bao launched a "Reader Scholarship Fund" to solicit donations for poor students, and an anonymous person was deeply moved. According to him, he was deeply moved, because he personally experienced the pain of dropping out of school, so he specially sent 50 million yuan, a very considerable amount, as a "Reader Scholarship Fund." It also illustrates the great role of the four words "personal experience."</p>
<p>As for those guys who "take off their torn cotton-padded jackets and forget their beggar's sticks," they have different intentions and cannot be generalized.</p>
<h3>Unreasonable</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>According to Liu Nan Sui Bi: Chen Zai studied poetry with Feng Dingyuan (both from Changshu), fully received his instructions, and his learning improved day by day, but he secretly slandered Dingyuan and did not exert any more effort. Dingyuan hated him very much and complained to the local gentry. Zai gained fame because of this. Therefore, later scholars in the town who followed Dingyuan, some because their reputation had not been established, imitated Zai's story, etc. It can be seen that the customs are frivolous, and this has been the case throughout the ages. I think this kind of person is simply a mad dog. Although they can be considered "famous," their character can be seen at a glance. Originally, it is common for students to surpass their teachers, but this is due to later diligence. When drinking water, one should think of the source. You should not forget the starting point of your learning. Even if your talent can surpass your teacher, you should not slander your teacher behind their back. Zeng Shen did not enter the village of Shengmu, which can be taken as a warning. Moreover, Chen Zai's talent is ultimately not as good as Feng Dingyuan's! But if we are fair, Feng Dingyuan's efforts to correct and block him were still insufficient. This kind of kid is not worth scolding. Scolding him would only pollute your mouth. It is better to laugh it off. As the saying goes, "If you are not surprised by strange things, the strangeness will disappear." This is the same as the ancient people reading books under the lamp and suddenly seeing a ghost face, growing from small to large. The person blew out the lamp and said, "I am ashamed to compete for light with demons." But Feng Dingyuan could not bear it and complained to the local gentry, causing this kid to gain fame because of this, which gave this kid a lot of advantages.</p>
<h3>Talking about Covers</h3>
<p>— Jie Ding</p>
<p>When I was a child, I loved to read martial arts novels. The scenes of swords and spears clashing, the methods of using skills, etc., really taught people to go to Mount Emei to learn martial arts. The skills like "Golden Bell Cover" and "Iron Shirt" written in those books are even more outstanding. People whose skills are proficient will become as solid as iron all over their bodies as long as they exert their energy. Knives and swords will bounce off their bodies, and the knives standing upright will break their edges. People with little strength will also crack their "tiger's mouth." These skills are really the best magic weapon for self-defense. As long as you have it, hey, no one will hurt me, and I can beat others at will.</p>
<p>There is only one thing I am not satisfied with: the authors of the novels often put a "weak spot" on the "Golden Bell Cover," either under the ribs, at the throat, or behind the neck. There is always a place where you can easily break all the "cover" skills with a light poke of your finger, and people with great skills will die immediately. A hero with "Golden Bell Cover" skills often loses his life on the "weak spot." It can be seen that the cover can never be seamless.</p>
<p>When I got a little older, I realized that it is the stupidest way to work hard on yourself to prevent being beaten. People who are really good at showing their skills specialize in giving covers to others, covering others. For example, ferocious beasts like tigers and lions are caught and covered with iron fences, and their power has no room to stretch. Even children can throw banana peels and chestnut shells at them across the fence. The brave can even spit at them. Covering others, of course, you will never be harmed.</p>
<p>Lions and tigers are still the kings of beasts after all. If you lock them up, you will forget their past ferocity. Moreover, people can only provoke them a few times from a distance, but they don't dare to really stroke the tiger's whiskers or swat the flies. The cattle and horses who are used to being slaves do not need iron cages: the horses pulling carts on the street need to wear two blinders, so that they can only look at the road in front of them from a limited gap, and they must not look around; a donkey grinding tofu and an ox pulling a waterwheel wear blinders to cover their eyes completely, so that they cannot see the ground and anything beside them, so that they can be taught to turn obediently. If their blinders are removed, what kind of world would it be! If the horse sees the bustling crowd on the side of the road, the cars roaring and passing by quickly, it will be frightened and jump up. Even if it is not panicked, the horse's eyes can freely look sideways, and it will not walk so solemnly and gracefully. If the ox turning around goes without blinders; seeing that it has been turning around all day in just that little bit of space, and has not moved a step after walking for several years, it will definitely go crazy. Moreover, constantly turning around in circles, you will see things beside you constantly shaking in front of you, and you will have to faint. Their owners certainly don't want them to violate the rules, so they have to firmly install blinders on the eyes of the cattle and horses.</p>
<p>The use of covers is certainly not that simple. For example, to prevent flies from disturbing, you have to use a gauze cover, a mask to resist "disease entering from the mouth," a windshield to protect from the wind, a glass cover on instruments, a face cover on noble ladies... all kinds of covers, and the usage is naturally different, and you can't finish talking about them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things are not that simple. Although covers can represent separation and discrimination, and hard covers are just like the Golden Bell Cover and the Net of Heaven and Earth mentioned by novelists, they all have the possibility of being pierced. As long as you find the "weak spot" - some covers only need to be hit lightly anywhere - all the covers will lose their effectiveness.</p>
<h3>After the Third World War (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Bixi</p>
<p>B: You, we must not let this conflict lead to another war.</p>
<p>C: Don't threaten me! Do you think I'm afraid of you just because you have the only gun in the world?</p>
<p>A: Alright, alright, stop arguing. We are the only three left. Arguing like this makes it seem like the world is not big enough to accommodate the three of us.</p>
<p>B: If the world is big enough to accommodate us, then why don't you give up one Australia?</p>
<p>A: Oh - that's not what the world being big enough means.</p>
<p>C: Look, you still want me to call North America a continent!</p>
<p>B: I have a suggestion. Since we can't agree on the demand for land, we might as well postpone the discussion of this matter and conduct a survey first.</p>
<p>A: I second that.</p>
<p>C: Those who agree, raise your hands. Okay, that passes. I propose that we now discuss the distribution of matches.</p>
<p>B: These matches must be the common property of mankind. I propose that we divide them equally among the three of us.</p>
<p>A: This proposal is simply absurd! First, I found the matches. Why should they be the common property of mankind? Second, how can eight matches be divided equally among three people?</p>
<p>B: Then what is your opinion?</p>
<p>A: I propose to give each of you two matches, and I will take four matches and the matchbox.</p>
<p>C: This proposal is absolutely unacceptable. I veto it!</p>
<p>B: Please don't act impulsively. Discuss it slowly.</p>
<p>A: Alas, it is really a shameful thing to waste valuable time on meaningless debates, while neglecting the work of rebuilding the world!</p>
<p>C: (To B) What do you think of this? He has the matches but does not advocate debate. Don't worry, as long as you give us the matches, we will immediately start the work of rebuilding! (Pause)</p>
<p>A: Please forgive me... I propose to adjourn the meeting temporarily. (A walks out, B watches him, then excitedly whispers to C)</p>
<p>C: This is a good idea. (Picks up a wooden stick) Come on!</p>
<p>B: Shouldn't we give him a strongly worded note first?</p>
<p>C: We can give it to him afterwards. Let's give him a surprise! (B and C exit. After a while, the sound of hammering is heard, followed by angry shouts, and then A's screams as he dies. After a while, B and C return.)</p>
<p>C: We have eliminated the public enemy of mankind. This time we have done a great service. Okay, give me four matches!</p>
<p>B: Four? Why four?</p>
<p>C: Isn't it the fairest thing to divide the spoils in half?</p>
<p>B: You have no conscience at all. Who came up with the idea this time?</p>
<p>C: True, but I was the first to strike!</p>
<p>B: That's simply not a reason. There are only three matches here. Take it or leave it! (C angrily raises the wooden stick. B takes out a pistol and shoots him. C falls to the ground. B quietly sits down, takes out a cigarette, lights a match and smokes.)</p>
<p>C: (Dying) Heavens! Do you know what a terrible disaster you have caused!</p>
<p>B: Who said that? I have achieved eternal peace for all mankind!</p>
<p>(Curtain falls.)</p>
<h3>Dog and Cat</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>I have a special love for raising dogs. After returning to the countryside, I wanted to raise one, but I could not find a "good breed" after searching for more than a month. The countryside is full of mangy, molting wild dogs, which are not very pleasing.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw the movie "A Dog's Way Home" in Shanghai, and I was very moved. More than ten years ago, I saw the performance of the "dog star" Rin Tin Tin, and I still have not forgotten it.</p>
<p>A famous British writer said in his long article "On Dogs and Cats": "Cats are only cute in the early stages of walking after sitting down. The French say: women should be born at the age of seventeen and die at the age of thirty; cats should be born soon and die before they grow up"! Then he turned his pen and greatly praised the dog, because the writer was originally a "lover" of dogs!</p>
<p>Dogs are docile and loyal servants. You stroke it, and it wags its tail to show welcome and loyalty. Similarly, you stroke a cat, and it only closes its eyes and ignores you, coldly and indifferently, with very little "reaction" and affectionate expression. It seems that their souls are mysterious and unpredictable, and they can survive without relying on others. Whether they are praised or admired, they all show indifference and indifference. This is why the French regard cats as completely different from dogs in soul and spirit.</p>
<p>We don't need to be prejudiced against these two animals, dogs and cats. Let's take a look at the commendation of the great Frenchman Pascal: "I have seen too much of mankind, and what I like most is dogs"! There are also many texts praising dogs in literature. Byron's praise of loyal humans is also a praise of loyal dogs. The last two lines of "Epitaph to a Newfoundland Dog" say:</p>
<p>"To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;</p>
<p>I never knew but one - and here he lies." Dogs are loyal and enthusiastic companions, working for you, running for you, and even dying for you. Therefore, there are many records of heroic deeds in literary history.</p>
<p>What about cats? Selfish, cunning, insidious, and mysterious, just like Dr. Jekyll's dual personality of doing good during the day and evil at night. He lies quietly by the burning fireplace, curled up on the carpet like a blind witch, emitting a bewitching, treacherous, and terrifying aura!</p>
<p>However, the dog holds its heart in its hand, its life is like daylight, without shadows or secrets, it is such a frank and simple fellow! Cats are far away from human life, while dogs follow closely like your own shadow, never leaving for a moment, becoming an indispensable part of your life. Charles Reade criticized a person: "He is only a man, but he is as loyal as a dog." This is what he praised a hero - "he is as loyal as a dog." Look at their achievements: herding sheep, hunting, guarding doors, detecting, transmitting messages... It is a loyal friend who always serves you devoutly!</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (60)</p>
<p>Xiao Bai looked at it and said happily, "Good, sing it again." Yun Qing repeated "The sun is shining, the spring is beautiful, and the birds are singing happily" twice. The parrot shook its wings and jumped twice on the shelf, as if it had found where the sound was. Xiao Bai said again, "Right, sing it again." Yun Qing sang two more sentences, and the parrot really learned it, laughing non-stop. Xiao Bai said, "Don't laugh, let it finish." Yun Qing sang two more sentences, and the parrot only jumped around on the shelf and did not sing. Xiao Bai laughed and said, "This thing is so annoying. It sings when you tease it, but it doesn't sing no matter how you tease it when it doesn't want to. Now you don't need to tease it, and it won't sing anymore! Come and sit in the room." Yun Qing followed him into the room. Xiao Bai lay on the short couch, shook his foot, and pointed to the parrot outside the window and said, "I always tease it once or twice every day to be happy. Zhu Zhai used to love to tease it the most. He was the most patient. He always made it learn a few sentences before he left. Recently, Zhu Zhai has not been seen. I don't know what he is busy with all day. Have you seen him?" Yun Qing saw that Xiao Bai mentioned Zhu Zhai, which was a good opportunity. She quickly took the opportunity to say, "He is very busy. Recently, something happened. He is divorcing his wife!" Xiao Bai was surprised and said, "Why is he divorcing his wife?" Yun Qing said, "I don't know very well. According to his wife, Zhu Zhai wants to marry Gu Qiwan, so he is divorcing her." Xiao Bai said, "Zhu Zhai is too reckless. Can his old man at home agree?" Yun Qing said, "He is probably still hiding it from his old man!" Xiao Bai said, "His father will never agree." Yun Qing said, "Young people nowadays don't care so much! If they want to do it, they will use all means to achieve their goal, no matter how opposed the family is, they don't care." Xiao Bai said, "Zhu Zhai has made a big mistake. He can't marry Qiwan: Qiwan can't marry Zhu Zhai either. Wait for me to call him and ask him clearly. I want to point him out, don't go astray." Yun Qing said, "This is your good intentions, but don't mention that I said it when you talk to him." Xiao Bai said, "Why should I mention you. I want to persuade him with justice, call him back, it has many harmful effects for him to marry Qiwan, no good at all. Qiwan will regret marrying him in the future, and Zhu Zhai is a married man, how can she marry him. I didn't know about this, not to mention, since I know it, I will try to save him, so that there will be no storms in his family." As he spoke, he called the bank and asked Zhu Zhai to come. Yun Qing felt that Xiao Bai was going to call Zhu Zhai to question him immediately, and it was inconvenient for her to stay here. After talking for a while, she excused herself and left in a hurry. Not long after Yun Qing left the Fei residence, Zhu Zhai also arrived. As soon as Xiao Bai saw Zhu Zhai, he said with a face full of smiles, "Zhu Zhai, you haven't come for a long time. You are going to hold a happy event soon. I want to drink your wedding wine. Why didn't you inform me?" Zhu Zhai heard this, and his heart couldn't help but jump, he forced himself to calm down and said, "What wedding wine is uncle talking about?" Xiao Bai said, "Such a big happy event, you still want to hide it from me, who doesn't know outside that you are going to marry Qiwan soon?" Zhu Zhai said, "Who did uncle hear it from?" Xiao Bai said, "I just ask if you have this matter or not?"</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Reimbursement</h3>
<p>— Lei</p>
<p>The writer Fuhu Le was a correspondent before he started writing. Once, he was ordered by the newspaper to go to the Canadian wilderness to inquire about the whereabouts of several missing pilots. He wanted to use the money from the fund, so what if he spent a little more; but he forgot to keep a detailed account of all the expenses.</p>
<p>When he returned home to report, he found that he had spent $3,000. In order to get reimbursed, he had to rely on memory and imagination. He listed all the equipment and clothes needed in the Arctic region: snowshoes, sleds, wool underwear, fur clothes, earmuffs, etc. After an hour of thinking, with painstaking effort, the total was only $2,800.</p>
<p>He racked his brains for another hour, and then he remembered the hunting dog he had brought to the ice field, which unfortunately died. He sent two people to get another dog to replace it - the cost was $130, no - $150. There was still $50 for which the use was not clear.</p>
<p>After searching his brains, Fuhu Le wrote out the final use, which was an emotional expense. The last item on the statement read: "Flowers offered in front of the dead dog - $50."</p>

<h3>No Place to Live, Persuading to Stay Temporarily, Refusing to Move Out After the Deadline, Extorting Huge Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Luo Juezhen asked: I rent the front building in Lane X, News Road. In the second year of the Republic of China, there was a Mr. Zhi, who, due to lack of housing, repeatedly asked someone to plead with me to rent the pavilion room in the north. Because his words were sincere, I reluctantly lent it to him. Later, in July of the thirty-fifth year, he moved out as agreed, but requested to temporarily borrow the pavilion room to allow a relative, Mr. Yu, to handle his wedding. Because Mr. Yu and I get along very well, I also accommodated him. Now that Mr. Yu's wedding is over, he left in December of last year. However, Mr. Zhi still has some scattered items left in the pavilion room, which have not been moved away. I have repeatedly urged him, but he ignored it, and even threatened to take back the house, unless I pay three taels of gold. He is extorting and demanding, reversing his past attitude. Because I do not understand the law, I do not know how to deal with it. Please advise me.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied] If the house has indeed been moved out and the household registration has been reported as moved, you can ask the local Baojia chief to certify the remaining scattered items, keep them in custody on your behalf, and immediately notify him to collect them. It is not allowed by law to collect tips.</p>

<h3>Fang Wangxi Wrongfully Accuses Li Fengzhu</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoguan</p>
<p>The name of Neo-Confucianism originated from the Song scholars, but the differences in views between Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuyuan were difficult to eliminate. Thus, "fragmented" and "empty" became the epitomes of the academic schools of Kao Ting (Zhu Xi) and Xiangshan (Lu Jiuyuan). (Lü Donglai invited Kao Ting and Jiuyuan to meet at Goose Lake, each to prove their learning, intending to integrate and unify them, but Zhu considered Lu to be empty and Lu considered Zhu to be fragmented, and their theories ultimately failed to converge.) Since then, the only one who could establish his own banner outside of Zhu and Lu was Yan Xizhai (Yuan) of the Qing Dynasty. Among Xizhai's disciples, Li Gangzhu (Gong) was the most capable of upholding his teacher's teachings. His contribution to propagating it was immense. Fengzhu was friendly with Fang Wangxi (Bao), and Bao once ordered his son Daozhang to learn from Gangzhu, but he did not agree with Fengzhu's opposition to Cheng-Zhu. (His letters discussing learning with Gangzhu are fully recorded in Wangxi's collected works, which can be read to understand.) After Gangzhu's death, Wangxi wrote his epitaph, stating that Gangzhu ultimately changed his teacher's method in his later years due to Fang's teachings. However, reading Fengzhu's "Grievance Valley Collection," his criticism of Cheng-Zhu never wavered from beginning to end. What Wangxi said was probably out of sectarian bias and may not have been factual. Therefore, Liu Diaozan wrote the "Chronological Biography of Shugu," strongly refuting his claims, and also said that Wangxi purely fabricated falsehoods, slandering a deceased friend. His words were: "The Prime Minister planned to recruit Mr. Li, but Lingao (Fang Bao) obstructed it due to old age and illness. At that time, Mr. Li was sixty-five years old, and it was not true that Mr. Li was old and sick. Some said: Lingao was very close to Mr. Li and knew that Mr. Li would definitely not accept the offer. However, Mr. Li's lifelong ambition was to practice the Way, not to live in seclusion like Shi Yin... I observe that Lingao's relationship with Mr. Li was very close, but their scholarship did not agree. Every time they discussed learning together, Mr. Li spoke eloquently and with righteous arguments, and Lingao could not interject, so he evaded the topic to avoid confrontation. After Mr. Li's death, he wrote an epitaph for him, briefly mentioning Mr. Li's morality and scholarship, only extensively recounting the beginnings and ends of his interactions with Mr. Li and Mr. Wang Yuan. He cleverly argued: 'With Gangzhu's respect for his teacher, he readily changed his mind after hearing my words.' He certainly wanted to highlight his own learning by diminishing that of Mr. Li, how could this be the intention of a friend?" I believe that Li Gangzhu's respect for Xizhai was comparable to the seventy disciples' reverence for Confucius, and it is unbelievable that he would readily change his mind after hearing Wangxi's words. As for the statement that Fengzhu was not employed because of Wangxi's obstruction, it seems like an overinterpretation and distortion, and Wangxi should not have gone that far. Furthermore, what did Wangxi have to fear or worry about that he had to prevent him from entering officialdom? However, looking at Wangxi's life, he was indeed the one who wrote the preface to the "Nanshan Collection" in the beginning, and when Dai Mingshi was incriminated, Wangxi faced interrogation but firmly denied it. Although he was spared execution by chance, he was more ashamed than Gao Linggong (Yun). And this slander of Li Gangzhu is enough to tarnish the reputation of a great literary master of his generation (the founder of the Tongcheng School).</p>
