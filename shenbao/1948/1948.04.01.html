<h3 id="c1">范登堡力主支持我國　美參院通過援華案　滬各界促美國會速批準 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓卅日電〕本日參院以口頭表決方式通過在一年內以四億六千三百萬美元援助中國之立法。此一行動之採取，乃在外交委員會主席范登堡敦促通渦該法案之後。范氏希望在本週末能使參院與衆院所通過之各援外法案中意見不一一點，獲致最後解決。</p>
<p>〔又電〕當本日參院通過援華議案時，范登堡在參院中發表演辭，略稱：「在第二次世界大戰中，中國爲備受最重大打擊之一國，在此一大戰中，中國永遠為吾人反對軸心之忠實盟邦，在日本之進攻與佔領中，首當其衝，但始終拒絕一切單獨媾和之機會，然而對軸心之勝利，並未終止中國之危險，勝利之果並未使中國享得益處，中國仍受內戰之患，其政府備受武裝中共之不斷攻擊，而成為侵略陰謀之受害人，此種侵略之陰謀破壞世界之和平。</p>
<p>「在此一切重大之負担與累積之困難下，中國瀕於危境，固不足爲異。所可異者，乃一切危機未能擊破中國繼續努力之勇敢精神。吾人不得不坦白承認目前局勢之危急。但依余之見，此時吾人若不竭力支持與鼓勵中國政府及中國人民抵抗侵略與維持獨立，則吾人將爲不忠於吾人自己之目標」。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕滬市參議會潘議長曁滬各界領袖等上月廿九日函司徒雷登大使，請轉美國會領袖及全體議員，敦促通過四億六千三百萬元援華法案，以阻赤色侵略。該電由潘議長領銜並有各大學校長等簽名。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅一日電〕民主黨參議員馬格努生，今日在參院提議，在依照對華救濟法案裝運之小麥內，麵粉至少應占百分之七十五。據稱，西北太平洋目前運往中國之小麥內百分之六十五爲小麥而非麵粉，此舉將使銅用之粉屑稀少且價格高漲，以致减少牛奶與家禽產物。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕國大第一二次預備會議，卅一日晨九時廿分舉行，仍由胡適任臨時主席，秘書處宣讀第一次預備會紀錄後，秘書長洪蘭友報告首次預備會中各代表對選舉主席團辦法所發表口頭及書面意見，經整理後之要點共分五部份，第一部份主張增加主席人數。第二部份主張維持原議。第三部份爲增加人數之數額，第四部份爲選舉方式。第五部份爲婦女名額，洪氏報告畢　，臨時主席胡適提出，應首先討論國大組織法是否修改問題，如續有新意見者亦可提出。自十時半至十時五十分，會場空氣達於爭執之最高峯，至十時三刻後，即進入表決階段。綜合今日各代表所提出之新意見，約有下列數點：（一）按國大組織法之規定，選主席團二十五人，另設特種委員會，由每單位產生一人爲委員，輔佐主席團處理行政，主席團開會時，特飄委員會委員得列席。（二）原草案文字上維持原草案，但需平均分配，同時在條文末加但書，即限制現任官吏當選主席團之名額，（三）應根據憲法，遵守憲法，國大預備會無權修改任何章則，故必須立即選出主席團，再行討論。且使吾人立即提案請立院修改國大組織法，立院恐亦不得立即工作，在時間上有所延誤，（四）婦女名額應佔總額百分之廿。以上數點意見中，第三點說明係現任立委林彬之主張，渠之强調遵守憲法精神及無權修改組織法等意見，均有法理根據，惟當時未獲得多數之同情，旋付表決，首先以維持原案者付表決，次採反表決，結果多數贊同修改。王寵惠代表乃提議一面將國大組織法移送國府交立法院迅速完成修正之立法程序，一面大會仍進行提名選舉之手續，至各代表所提人數之意見，均作附件，隨提案移送國府轉立院參考。有人並主張立院如修改該案條文，必須不作硬性規定，僅以「若千人」之彈性規定即可，當經一併通過。至提名選舉主席團事，以時間關係，未能討論。</p>

<h3 id="c17">兩個上午·一項決議 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>本報特寫——（三月卅一日於南京）</p>
<p>國大召開，原是民意的考騐，民主政治更需要長時間的努力，從錯誤經騐中換取敎訓，走上進步。胡適今天又被「拉夫」，坐上臨時主席的位子。當他爲表決器糾紛而煩惱時，他說：「今天得到一個敎訓，以後誰作主席，一定要記取使用表決器時先試用一次」。這就是進步。由這觀點來看大會，兩個上午勉强換來的一項決議，不過是許許多多的經驗中的一個罷了。</p>
<p>卅一日上午，整個會塲充滿了呌囂的聲浪，發言者爭先恐後，次序漸亂，迎胡校長也雞於控制。本來這第二次預備會是請于右任代表任臨時主席的，開會前，于院長來了，又走了，改推于斌，會塲上却找不到主敎，祇好又拉胡適代理。今天的會是繼續昨天的議議題，討論主席團選舉辦法，本來秘書處歸納昨天的意見已經很完善了，但今天又枝節橫生，除去爲絕食的簽署代表而有人大聲疾呼外，甚至連表決器——最科學的工具——也成了討論的對象，成了懷疑的目標，胡適確已盡到他的才能，至少有三次是表現出來了。第一次是在會衆情緒激昂時宜布休息十分鐘，遂緩和下來，第二次是尊重反表決的結果，雖然反表決未必眞是代表大多數，亦使大家情緒平定，第三次是通過慰問絕食代表後，有人還想發言，胡主席「快刀斬亂麻」，一聲「散會」，代表們紛紛起立，誰也不能再說下去。</p>
<p>決議之所以順利完成，應備功於一項報告和一項提議，洪蘭友奉命宣讀秘書處所整理昨天各代表意見的結果，條理分明，所有主要的意見都包括進去，再發言者便無什麼新意見了。王寵惠提議，一面送請國府轉立院修改國大組織法，一面進行主席團的推選，俾便迅速進入議程，爭取時間，則成爲討論的根據。在報告後，提議前，胡適主席曾先就（一）維持原辦法，（二）決定修改選舉辦法，（三）另外一項建議，主席團仍爲廿五人，另設特種委員會，每單位推代表一人參加，列席主席團，付表決。但，表決時却引起意想不到的糾紛。</p>
<p>表決前後，爭取發言的代表很多，意見却少新穎，以致嘶聲四起。林彬上台發言，他的意見頗値得重視。他說：我們應遵守憲法，主席團問題不解決，無法開大會，而預備會的決定不能修改任何法律，祇要推出主席團，開成大會，以後盡有機會修改。但他的話太長了，在激昂的情緒中，也被嘶下。女代表章繩以要求增加主席團婦女名額比例到百分之二十，却獲得同情的堂聲。這時，終於表決了，胡適先以維持原辦法付表決，表決器上電燈亮了，一共有九百卅三人贊成，在塲代表一八六二人，多數。主張修改者中，有人對表決器表示懷疑。大喊「假的」，嚇得管表決器的小姐不敢關機器，胡適宣布可以推代表去檢查，沒有人去，葫適祗好來一次反表決，結果贊成修改的竟是九百八十一人，兩面意見加起來，超過在塲代表數額，很明顯，有人是掀了兩次表決器。這時會塲更亂起來，胡適說：一定有人好奇，所以掀了兩次，爲了平靖會塲，於是宣布休息十分鐘。</p>
<p>繼續開會時，情緒安定多了，胡適宣布尊重反表決的多數意見，通過修改案，同時提出王寵專等代表的提議，有幾位代表繼續發言，主張注意邊疆民族代表加入主席團，主席團人數不作硬性規定等等。這時，纔算製定了兩個上午的一項決議，將國大組織法送請國府轉立法院迅速修正，並將兩次大會各代表的意見附送，作修改的參考。王寵惠提議中還有即時進行推選主席團，因爲時間關係，祗奸等待明天再說。</p>
<p>討論到慰問絕食的簽署代表時，雖然也很嘈雜，也不斷有噓聲，也還有些意見，可是胡適的意見却順利通過，胡適說，請授權本次大會主席，就提議之代表中指定五人至十人，前往慰問，並勸進食，以候政府解決。馬文傳呼，一面慰問，同時解決，有人噓他，於是便沒有下文。胡適說。這不是我們能解決的。</p>
<p>第二次預備會議迅速地散了，希望明天的「民主之課」更能有更多的進步。</p>

<h3 id="c20">社論　看義國四月選舉 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>義大利議會定於四月十八日舉行改選，離今尙有十幾天，不特　國國內左右兩派的政黨競爭已到了白熱化的程度，而且國際上兩大集團所從事的「冷戰」，也已將其重心移至義大利半島了。這幾天來，世界的視綫正集中在四月十八日的義大利。在義國當局決定議會改選的日期的時候，國際上早就充滿了駭人聽聞的謠言，不是說蘇聯企圖將其共產勢力侵入義大利半島，就是說義國共黨在國內活躍異常，對於四月普選獲勝可操左券，使世界各國對於義國政局今後的發展，莫不予以密切的注視；因爲義國普選的結果如何？不僅足以決定義國的命運，而且足以左右整個歐洲的局勢。美國爲防範共黨勢力侵入義大利半島起見，首由馬歇爾國務卿發表演說，在口頭上向義共提出嚴重警告，謂義共如若控制了義國政府，即爲義國退出歐洲復興計劃的明證，美國自當不再予以經濟的援助。其後美國又與英法二國，發表一種聯合宜言，提出修改對義和約的建議，主張將特里雅斯特港歸還義大利。美國對義國採取這種剛柔兼施的外交攻勢，其用意是卯常明顯的，乃在爭取義大利的人心，當能發生非常重大的作用，甚至足以左右四月普選的結果；但是在另一方面，却也引起了嚴重的反響。</p>
<p>第一是蘇聯，她對於美國這種外交攻勢，決不會「無動於中」的；蘇聯代表退出柏林盟國管制委員會，就是蘇聯在「冷戰」中的一記有力「還擊」今後外交戰上的鬥智鬥力，一定是要層出不窮的。第二是南斯拉夫，因爲關係太密切的緣故，南國外長　米克貫先向英美法　國提出强硬抗議，頓使特港的局勢趨於緊張，南國陸軍巡避隊曾一度侵入特港英美防區，　當地警察發生衝突，這雖然是小規模的意外事件，但誰能担保不致擴大？英美已調至大批生力軍增强防務，同時在外交上，又有南國要求與義國直接談判，索取義國的戈星齊里港，作爲特港歸還義國的交換條件；但是義國外交部發言人已聲明堅決拒絕。所以今日的義大利半島，在事實上已成爲「冷戰」的戰塲，且已到了攤　的階段；這次普選的結果如何，實爲歐洲局勢的決定因素，甚至也爲整個世界和平所　！</p>
<p>自從捷克政變建立共產政權之後，歐洲似乎已經有了一道楚河漢界，把一個歐洲劃分爲東西兩個歐洲，西歐五國聯盟的盟約也已在巴黎簽字成立；但是西歐聯盟能否實現其預定的目標及發揮其最大的作用，義大利是否參加，也是一個十分重大的關鍵，故以英·法·荷·比·盧五國而論，她們是非拉牢義大利擴大西歐聯盟的範圍不可的。又義大利半爲適爲伸入地中海的一隻脚，以軍略的觀念而言，美國是決不讓共產勢力侵入義大利的；何况義國在四月普選之後，法國也將在五月內舉行普選，義國普選的結果，自能直接影響到法國的普選，所以美國對於義國普選，決不願義共獲勝的。此在蘇聯；她的重親義國，有如其重視芬蘭，初無二致。蘇聯鞏固其在鐵幕以內的地位之後，早就有將其鐵幕繼續西移的企圖，但是在東南歐洲，仍要受到土耳其和希臘的牽制，不能為所欲爲；若義大利一且為共產勢力所控制，則不僅希士兩國不得不受其支配，使蘇聯在東南歐洲的地位益形鞏固；而且蘇聯的勢力也隨之伸入地中海。足以左右法國五月普選，屆時所謂西歐聯盟，也就無意義可言了。道就是義大利成爲冷戰戰塲的主因。</p>
<p>但是放眼看看義大利國內的情形，黨爭的劇烈，也已到了白熱化的　度；義大利本是一個地瘠民貧的島國，戰前靠了海外的殖民地，衣食所需尙能自給自足；但是在戰後，所有的殖民地旣被剝奪，衣食所需的物資來源也就中斷了；再加上義國人民在大戰中曾受重大損失，所以戰後的義國，不論國計或是民生，均瀕於破產的邊緣；誰也不能否認，這種經濟的社會的背景，徒然有利共產黨的興起。姑以去年普選的結果而論，基督敎民主黨獲得七百八十七萬票，而社會黨與共產黨各得四百萬票，其他各黨合得四百萬票，總計右派及第三方面所得票數，只比左派多一百萬票。但是一年以來，義大利的經濟情形，每况愈下，共產黨的勢力反面有增無减。參加這次普選的政黨，已不下九十九個，將來的結果如何？雖然還是一個「未知數」；但據權威人士的猜測，共產黨與社會黨，可能得票百分之三十五至四十，而某督敎民主黨僅能獲得百分之三十至三十五；由此可知喀斯貝里內閣的前途，是朱可樂觀的。美國朝野的焦慮，就是一個絕好的證明；義國豪富紛紛準備逃亡，與國內各地競選的情形，恰成了一個顯著的對照，喀斯貝里總理前大發表競選演說，要求人民「對自己的良心投一信任票」，以其宗敎的熱誠向國人呼籲，能不能喚起義人訴諸良知，憑其常識的判斷，投其神聖的一票，也只有等待至四月十八日揭曉了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕我國出席聯合國安全理事會軍事代表團團長何應欽將軍，應主席電召，已於昨日午後四時十分乘泛美公司飛剪號巨型機飛抵龍華機塲。吳國楨，宣鐵吾，方治，潘公展代表項員權，俞大維，蔣經國，錢大鈞，杜聿明夫婦，蔣鼎文，劉峙，傅正模，邵伯昌，莊禹靈等三時左右已到塲歡迎，何氏舊部頗多自南京趕來迎迓者，綜計歡迎者在二百人以上，並有警備司令部靑年軍憲三營公訓同學會等儀仗隊列隊受檢閱，歡迎陣容之盛，打破龍華機塲歷來記錄。何氏着上將制服，面貌豐腴，下機時容光煥發，於接受女童子軍代表及杜聿明十齡女公子獻花後，即步出機塲，檢閱儀仗隊，並與歡迎代表一一握手。陳誠總長亦於四時前趕到，惟因體弱之故，未進機塲，僅在汽車中坐候。何氏步出機塲，至陳氏座車前握手致意後，即驅車赴官邸休息。　本市參議會，市黨部，市政府各局及工商界人士爲表示敬意起見，特於午後五時假逸園飯店舉行盛大茶會歡迎。何氏於五時十分於熱烈掌聲中蒞會，主席方治致辭，對何氏過去之豐功偉績，備加贊揚，並對日前來滬之蔣豐文將軍一併表示歡迎。市參議會秘書長項昌權繼之發言，謂今日赴機塲歡迎人數之多，具見國人對何將軍期望之殷，希望何氏發揮過去之精神，平定國家之禍亂。市參議會潘議長因赴京出席國大，不能趕回歡迎，順表歉意。主席隨即請何氏致辭，何氏首對各界歡迎盛情深表感謝，隨即報告在國外之工作，（詳見書面談話）尋即論及美軍事援華，認爲近數月來美國朝野對此均表關切，援華方案預計下月中旬時美國會亦能有決定，援華款項數字雖不大，但可表示美國之關懷。本人認爲：一切要本身有辦法，如此則外援方能源源增加。對於美國之觀感，認爲美國之富力不僅表現於大都市，尤見之於農村，美國農村之生產，幾已完全機械化及電氣化。普通之農家中，均有無綫電，電氣冰箱及一切衛生設備，其生活水準之高，絕非其他國家所能比擬。推原其故，爲美國人民守法，秩序安定，建設易於收效，對於現代之科學技術，亦善於利用。惟美于國各方面之突飛猛晉，尙爲近二十年來之事，中國如能恢復和平，深信埋頭建設三十年後，亦能有此成就。何氏最後對英國今日之堅苦奮鬥，亦備致頌揚，謂英國今日物資之缺乏，尤過於我國，惟人民有民主及守法之傳統，一切統制均澈底而公平，皇室與庶民同甘苦，故生活雖苦而民無怨言，此種精神，値得國人效法。何氏辭畢，掌聲雷動。蔣　　鼎文繼之被邀發言，亦推頌何氏之勳蹟，並謂「國事至此，非總長回來不可」。大會至六時正結束。何氏定一日晨晉京出席國大。</p>
<p>書面談話</p>
<p>闡述軍參團工作</p>
<p>茶會後何氏隨即於逸園飯店休息室內招待記者，發表書面談話如下：</p>
<p>「本人於民國卅五年七月奉派赴美，出席聯合國軍事參謀團會議，此次返國，係向中樞述職，請示有關軍事參謀團工作各項問題，並出席國民代表大會。</p>
<p>「軍事參謀團，係根拽聯合國憲章第四十七條而設，由安全理事會五常任理事國即中，英，美，法，蘇五國之軍事代表所組成，爲安全理事會之軍事顧問機構，一九四六（民卅五）年二月在倫敦成立，三月遷至紐約，軍參團成立後，即奉安全理事會訓令，飭依軍事觀點，研究憲章第四十三條；簡言之，即研究組織聯合國軍及其有關軍事各問題，軍參團爲進行此項研究，計先後設立五個小組委員會（亦由五國代表組成）進行研討，每一問題，均經小組作初步討論，然後再經軍參團會議討論，其中以「聯合國軍組織一般原則「暨」此軍隊」之「總兵力及編成之估計」最爲繁複。「聯合國軍組織」般原則」，已於去年四月底討論完畢，「呈送聯合國安全理事會，現尙在安全理事會核議中。該原則計四十一條，其中尙有十六條，在軍參團并未獲得五國一致同意。其進行之困難，可想而知矣。軍參團將一般原則呈出後，即繼續商討總兵力及編成之估計。所謂佔計，即研究聯合國軍究需多大之兵力及如何編成，此吏係一極困難之問題。經過八個月之長時間，始經小組將陸海空軍總兵力之估計，討論完畢，而五國意見亦大多未趨一致。此項估計，現尙在軍參團會議討論中。此種國際武力組織，因史無前例，且國際關係綜錯複雜，牽涉甚多，故歷時二年，開會幾達二百次，而商得結果者，僅如上述，但各國代表確已費盡心力。關於軍參團工作詳細情形，因團內辦事細則第十三條規定，不得單獨對外發表，故過去甚少公開向國內報導。其經軍參團同意發表者，如一般原則之全文及各代表團所提總兵力估計等，前已先後見諸報端，茲不贅述。</p>
<p>「聯合國軍，係備供安全理事會用以維持或恢復國際和平及安全之實際力量，故世界人士，咸望其早日組成。我國對聯合國之竭誠擁獲，已明載憲法，我政府對軍參團工作，自極願盡力贊助，應欽個人尤願繼續努力，以觀其成也。」</p>
<p>答記者問</p>
<p>無意競選副總統</p>
<p>記者旋紛紛提出問題，經何氏一一答覆，誌其要者如下：（一）外傳何將軍回國後將競選副總統，確否？答：爲國家服務，不計職位，本人無意競選。（二）馮玉祥在美活動如何？將軍對其活動有何感想？答：馮先生初至美時曾一度遇見，渠曾在T．V．A．考察五六日，馮氏持反對政府態度後，即未晤面。美國爲民主國家，各種意見均可自由發表，馮之活動美人並不重視。本人認爲國家多難，除共產黨之外，一切人士應共同努力。（三）何將軍認爲蘇聯之野心是否會造成第三次世界大戰？答：聯合國參謀團中頗多蘇聯朋友，此問題不便答覆，請原諒。（四）美國人對中國政府素持批評態度？何將軍對此有何高見？答：美人終認爲我國政府之改革尙不够，但究應如何革新，亦未具體明言，關於此點，本人亦未問過馬歇爾。（五）美人對馬歇爾之政策持何態度？答：大多數人贊成馬歇爾之援歐援華政策。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕私人使用汽車限制辦法公佈後，施行時發生若干困雞，因原則上規定過嚴，各方提出改進意見甚冬。美大使館亦提備忘錄一件稱：以滬市府及公用局先後公佈公私汽車登記及過戶審核標準，並停止辦理私人汽車之登記及核發牌照，對於汽車進口商及個人自購汽車與汽車轉售等，勢將引起種種困難問題，盼中國政府有關機關對節約實施方案有關私人汽車使用之規定重行考慮，宜從汽油分配方法·車輛·稅類·牌號加以限制，以期公允。又滬市府呈擬「運用節約使用汽油方法，以控制使用汽車方案。」其理由以私人自國外携車進口，已明令停止，汽車商每月輸入汽車亦已訂有限額，凡此業已進口之汽車，如必對其使用人加以嚴格限制，則將使車輛停擱，機件損壞，淪爲廢物，而准用車限於合乎規定之私人或私法人，則將來車輛實買賣登記勢將發生冒名頂替情事，且英美商人對我國限制汽車之辦法，亦一再表示異議，故認為有變更必要。現悉：政院節約督導委會經將原案重加審查後，業加修訂，改爲限制私人使用汽車辦法，其中對需要汽油加以規定限制，如小型車每輛每月以六十加侖爲限，大型汽車以一百加侖爲限等。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通部長俞大維曾在浙贛路復路紀念碑上寫道：「湘贛產米，浙江產鹽，浙贛路實通有無，關係平民生計至鉅」。我們從杭州循浙贛路前進，在蕭山，金華，衢州，江山等地，還看見遠近不同的山巒，而一踏入江西境界，慢慢地便發現一大片，一大片的平原，不過荒地多於熟地，有些地，可以看得出多年沒有施肥，地的底層已暴露在外面，紅的顏色，在紅土上躺着尙未復甦的枯草。由於這些平原，我們可以瞭見若干年以前，江西一定是相當富庶的。江西省，她有十七萬三千五百一十三方公里，每方公里以一千五百市畝計，則有兩億六千〇二十六萬九千五百市畝，已墾的據調查有三千八百四十八萬六千五百十三市畝。顯然的，這是個先天的雛型榖倉，在老百姓同心合力的開發之下，豐碩的收穫是可以期待的。</p>
<p>江西榖倉有名無實</p>
<p>我們以客觀的眼光看江西省，覺得江西省確是產米之區，但可惜沒有開發，沒有開發的原因，當然因爲人口少，人口旣少，糧貪也不可能產得特別多。不過現在各地均認爲江西是穀倉，湘米是濟粵，桂的，而贛米當然有餘，所以連最近上海也要放棄購鍚米而要購贛米了，則江西人士又要大起一番恐慌了。</p>
<p>四大名鎭關係深切</p>
<p>在這有名無實的穀倉中，另外還有四個大名鼎鼎的鎭　，一即樟樹，以藥材爲聚散地，俗謂「藥不到樟樹不齊」，而該鎭又爲米糧的吐納口之一，一即景德，爲磁器的產地，淸乾隆時產五十萬擔，民二十五年產四十七萬餘擔，現在則僅產三十萬擔，也並不頂興盛，一即河口，爲江西紙十萬〇五千擔的集散地現在因為成本及銷路問題，出產减少，市面也衰落。一爲吳城，是木材的集散地，據稱：江西年產一千七百餘萬株，大半都經此由水路運走，戰後也並不興盛，規在浙贛路通車，要將减少他的價値。這四大名鎭實在也與穀倉有密切關係的，因爲農村富庶，才會使這四大名鎭益發興旺，人口繁多，才會企圖於另種特產事業的經營。今天江西省第一件重要的事，莫如把江西的荒地全面開墾，滋長繁榮，則百廢始得俱舉。而開墾之前，當還要有待農田水利之擾良先決條件。</p>
<p>計劃完美經費難籌</p>
<p>現在江西省比較遠大的計劃有關於農田水利者，莫如「K．V．A．」計劃，即是治理贛江之水，以求其在洪水泛濫時蓄以發電或灌溉農田。這當然是一個很好的計劃，但是談何容易，現在雖已全部測量完竣，而開始整治的經費實在沒有辦法。據贛財廳長洪軌告記者：贛省財政，百分之五十以上賴中央撥補，惟中央借贛穀一千萬餘担，將來如能償還五百萬祖，也能舉辦「K．V．A．」計劃。</p>
<p>十萬水庫蓄水防旱</p>
<p>其次，是贛省的十萬水庫，蓄水以防乾旱，而水多之時，也可將餘水注入庫內，這當然也是一個好計劃。建廳長胡嘉詔告記者：現在正慢慢在着手辦，當然一時不會有極大的效果。再次，爲整治鄱陽湖，鄱湖四週均爲沃土，如能整治好，當可大量增產，現在贛省也在着手舉辦。這些農出水利的計劃，一時肖難見到實效。</p>
<p>修築溝塍利便墾殖</p>
<p>在計劃沒有實現之前，我們最好能把田塍溝渠簡單的爲他們修築好，這樣使移來的老百姓或是還鄉的老百姓易於墾殖。再如果我們更進一步，建築或特約一部份模範農村，澈底改進農村的生活，使耕者得安息遊樂，使耕者有其山，眞正的實現民生主義，則恐怕討壓城市煩亂的人也會因此而回到鄉村中去，那麼江西的農村該是最爲理想的了。</p>
<p>荒蕪殘敗的地方容易建設，但我們希望在建設時要把基礎打得堅實，同時要做得澈底，趕快把這華中的穀倉完成充實起來！（三月廿八日。南昌）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約卅一日廣播：華盛頓訊，參衆兩院對六十二億〇五百萬美元之對外援助一法案，當能獲致妥協，而於本週中送呈總統。但參院對於將西班牙包括於歐洲復興計劃之內一點，表示反對。此在歐洲方面，英法義三國對美衆院決定准許西班牙加入歐洲復興計劃一節，深感震驚憤慨，尤其是義國方面，認爲此舉足以增强共黨在四月十八日選舉中之地位，而使英美法建議將特港歸還義大利之意義减少。馬德里官方表示「欣慰」。莫斯科方面尙未發表評論，惟各方均認爲美衆院此一行動將有助於蘇聯進行外交「冷戰」。</p>

<p>〔路透社紐約卅日電〕婦女家庭雜誌頃發表前陸長史汀生之回憶錄，題日「時代與危機。」透露史氏曾於一九四五年夏波茨坦會議時，向杜魯門總統建議以原子彈之秘密爲工具，使蘇聯秘密警察國民主化。蓋史氏認爲世界組織若包含一警察國，決不能使該新組織得有有效的控制。數月以後，史氏亦承認該一建議爲不可用史氏日，史達林在波茨坦曾對蘇聯之在地中海及其他蘇勢力圈外之地獲得基地，表示强力之興趣。當美國開始準備太平洋方面之攻勢時，紅軍在歐洲逐日擴張勢力，以爲蘇聯非份要求之支援，當時史氏已知美蘇之間不能有永久安全的國際關係存在。一九四五年九月渠乃上書羅斯福，表示已知不能以原子彈之秘密，使蘇改變態度。渠並向羅斯福提出備忘錄，指出美國若繼續與蘇談判，而一方面握有原子彈之秘密，適足增加蘇聯對美之懷疑。因此渠建議由美國在英國一國之支持下，與蘇直接接洽，成立原子彈管制之協定，結果其建議並未被採用。一九四七年渠雖知直接向蘇接洽原子管制之成功希望，已較一九四五年爲减，然猶以爲不妨一試。迨至是年九月渠八十誔辰時，渠已確認與目前之共產主義，實已不能爲同一目標而並立。史氏不以爲蘇聯將發動戰爭，渠囑願作蘇聯媾和之美人，充分參加西歐復興之工作，迅速建立世界和平而非美國和平，一方面則從事於美國國內自由與繁榮之建立。</p>

<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有　本報編輯室譯</p>
<p>（五）政策執行者史迪威</p>
<p>戰時美國對華政策主要執行者史迪威將軍，在他與中國中央政府相周旋的整個三年中，一直以美國的租借供應品作爲控制的手段。</p>
<p>他用租借作爲一種法寳，企圖最後能統治中國—但是結果失敗了。</p>
<p>史迪威在處理中美合作關係方面，缺乏友好的敬意和坦白。他幾乎一直和蔣委員長不相協調，似乎不把他和其他中國領袖作爲同事看待，而把他們當做要加以克服的障礙看待。威脅是他在勸誘他人時最熟練的方法。</p>
<p>史迪威及其僚屬或則施用壓力要求擴大在華的權力，或則在華盛頓方面不准其放手做去的時候，就批評華盛頓「柔弱無能」。官方的記錄顯示他曾　次要求華盛頓給予權力，俾以停止供應品作爲對付重慶的手段。他這種行動在中國方面早爲人所熟知。</p>
<p>根據我所知道的關於他在一九四四年被召回的種種情形，我相信他最後的威脅乃是除非他可以自由控制中國的作戰實力，不然一切對華援助將予停止，或者較此爲尤甚。—至於羅斯福總統是否支持這種主張，則不得而知。</p>
<p>雖然由種種不同理由，這個歷史性的哀的美敦書爲中美兩國政府所嚴守秘密，但是我對於它可能發生的影響却毫不懷疑—那就是由史迪威委員長來代替蔣委員長。</p>
<p>在史迪威擔任中緬印戰區司令及蔣委員長參謀長的整個時期中，這是決定他行動的一個目標。所以，自從一九四二年間史迪威走出緬甸建議將中國軍隊置於美國軍官管理之下之日起，直至一九四四年被迫自重慶被召回的戲劇性攤牌爲止，這一百標控制着美國的對華關係。</p>
<p>載至那時候爲止，史迪威的作爲並無推薦他擔任這樁巨大任務的資格，而造成他提出這個重大要求的中國在軍事上的失利，其過失由於他自己的缺點和短視者，與由於中央政府者同樣多或者更其多。以後，我將分析其間的因果關係。</p>
<p>但是除了其他一切考慮之外，史迪威對蔣委員長的最後要求苟予准許，則我相信這將召致美國對華政策最黑暗的失敗，其結果，祇能造威一個國家的瓦解，而該國的友誼和實力，不論我們怎樣時常判斷錯誤，一向是並且依然是我們在東半球最大的資產。</p>
<p>我深知中國人的情緒和個性，確信不論是史迪威或者任何外國人，都不能統治他們，除非經由武力並且靠了中國傀儡的帮助。可是，猶如史迪威的繼任人魏德邁將軍不久之後很明白加以表現的，和中國政府相處另有一種合理而有效的方法，而史迪威却從沒有嘗試過。</p>
<p>在最近幾個月中，美國又在堅持「改革」爲援助中國反抗共產主義的先決條件，這使我不得不懷疑華盛頓是否已經回復到史迪威這種不可取辦法的精神。我們是不是能够再度要求中央政府作實際上的退讓，作爲我國對華援助的代價？</p>
<p>顯然的，在史迪威被召回很久之後，甚至在他逝世之後，他對中央政府的錯誤估計，對於我國戰後的對華政策，依然具有一種微妙的和引起偏見的影響。這不是不自然的，因爲史迪威對於中國的觀念，曾有一個很長的時間左右着華盛頓的能度。</p>
<p>我覺得史迪威任務失敗的眞芷原因，華盛頓方面從未正式加以承認，那就是：一個人被派去擔任一樁超過他能力和不合他個性的任務，猶如我想在這些回憶中加以指出的。</p>
<p>由於深恐人家以爲我在對一個已經無法爲自己辯護的人加以歧視之故，我應該說明早在史迪威逝世之前，我就曾把這種批評置於他的面前。據我所知，這並未引起他的反應。</p>
<p>縱使是如此，假如我不能確定我這種公開講述其經過能辯明第二次世界大戰史中最爲人誤解的幾章中之一這個健全的目的，我是不願意這樣做的，而這一章，對於適切理解我國的對華關係，現在是非常重要的。</p>

<p>國米方面，除三月份剩餘之配米十餘担外，尙有食米一萬餘噸，係聯總於去年擬運往華北共匪區者，後以交通陰梗無法裝運，而由政府收買者，爲時較久，品質低劣，且各種米互相混雜，當局本月份配售時，決仍維三月份原價每斗廿四萬元，目前所以定爲每人廿五萬元者，因其數量較三舟月份增加十兩之故。至四月份配米期限，定自今日（一日）起，至廿五日截止。</p>
<p>配油售價分兩種</p>
<p>又計口配油已定於本月份起實施，每人每月配油十二兩，照配米成規自由買賣，配油價格：菜汕，豆油，蔴油，每人五萬元，生油每人五萬五千元。自本月十一日起開始，至廿五日截止。</p>

<p>癥結在巨額財產</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕無錫人嚴培興，指其妻爲覬覦財產，將其强當瘋人，送至普慈療養院幽禁一事，自經無錫同鄉會揭露，並延聘周孝庵等律師登報聲明後，其妻嚴袁寳英昨亦延請顯文光等律師，刋登辯駁啓事，並於下午三時，招待記者，提出種種證件，一方面無錫同鄉會亦於昨晚再度招待記者，雙方各執一詞，內情極爲撲朔迷離。</p>
<p>嚴培興究竟有無精神病，這是本案焦點之一。嚴培興本人，無錫同鄉會以及他這一方面的親屬說是絕對沒有，袁寳英則說他確有精神病。袁在昨天招待會中提出許多文件和照片，這些文件都是嚴培興以「嚴倜」具名，親筆寫的荒店言語，例如「全世界各國開年一月一日起，實行天主元年，天主政府，皇帝制度，最高領袖爲皇帝上天王嚴倜，天國皇帝蔣中正，美國皇帝杜魯門，英國皇帝喬治五世，蘇聯皇帝史丹林，四大强國，六月一日」。「天欲娶中國優秀女子二位，能知各國言語，欲娶美國優秀女子二位，欲娶英國優秀女子一位，欲娶蘇聯優秀女子一位，均能知國際世界大局；以上六　，同時舉行婚禮，由中國，美國，英國，蘇聯大總統介紹證婚，四月二十日」。　全世界各國文武大臣，每月天歷初一日十五日上午九時至十時，均向皇帝上朝敲金鐘爲號，有事奏事，無事午飯之後退　，七月念九日」。「全世界國民黨，革民黨，共匪黨，社會黨，勞工黨，靑年黨，靑年團，靑年會，藍衫黨，靑衣黨，老頭子流亡黨，拆白然，職工會，基督敎，佛敎，回敎，及其餘團黨敎派等等，一概取消，祗准服從天主敎爲限，六月一日」……等等。類似這一種可笑的文字。</p>
<p>荒唐文字之外一張怪異照相</p>
<p>據說共有一兩百張之多。除文字之外，又有兩張照片，其中嚴培興披髮而坐，身前擺一供桌，桌上蠟燭一副，袁寳英則跪在桌前（見圖），據說這是嚴培興自稱上天皇，要他妻子服從的照相。又有一大幅房龍畫的一條龍，一個太陽，畫上寫「天龍主大正眞」。關於這些荒唐的文字照相與圖畫，昨天嚴培興本人如此解釋：文字有一部份是他偶然寫來玩玩的，一部份是袁寳英敎他寫的。照片則說來話長，三十五年年底，他因受妻子的氣，憤而回到無錫家鄉，　備帶雙仃，後來經族人的勸解，他妻子到無錫來向他跪求悔過，這張照片是當時他妻子說要留一個紀念而拍攝不料竟是「預蓄的陰謀一，拿來作爲他患精神病的證據；至於那幅　，他是預備用作廠內出品的商標。</p>
<p>神情稍呆滯　說話還正常</p>
<p>那末，嚴培興究竟有無精神病呢？從他的外表看來，除了神情稍見呆鈍以外，看不出什麼異常的徵象，在昨天晚上的招待會裏，他在麥克風前報告經過（見圖），口齒雖然　緩而不很淸楚，講話還可以說正常。他在出普慈療養院以後，曾到仁濟醫院驗過、據說是「驗得並無精神異常」，又到怡和醫院住過幾天，該院黃種强醫師川了一張此人「患心臟擴大及血壓過高」的證明書。這樣說來，普慈療養院為何當他是精神病人而收容呢？記者爲此昨天特地去訪問普慈療養院負責診治嚴培興的主任醫師黃英邦氏。</p>
<p>普慈療養院　黃醫師談話</p>
<p>黃醫師認爲嚴培興確有精神病，在醫學上這種病稱爲「譫妄症」，西文名是Paranoia，病人時有不安靜失眠及心臟衰弱症狀，在外表上及生理上並無什麼特殊變化，在腦力方面，逐漸的衰退，長久以後，必變爲痴狂。嚴培興這次送進院去，有衛生局的介紹信，（關於衛生局介紹信的來源後文另有叙述）並根據家屬哀寳英的病情報告。嚴在進院以後四十餘天中，曾打强心劑一針，嗎啡一針，安眠藥一針及補腦劑五針，所謂打毒性麻醉劑八針者實係如此。至於嚴培興手腕上的傷痕，黃醫師解釋說，凡是精神病人送到醫院來的，其本人大都不承認有病，而吵着要出院，因此院方在有必要時，可以用一種皮手套將病人雙手套住，這種皮手套在腕間用帶縛住。嚴培興手腕上的傷痕，就是因爲用手套後掙扎而起的。又嚴培興所說院方索價十億元將他釋放。黃醫師說事實是這樣的：嚴在進院後，最初對黃說：「請你帮帮忙，軋一個朋友，等我出去後，廠裏給一大位置你做。」後來又常常對他說：「來來來，不要給別人聽見，你要錢也可以，三億四億怎樣？」這種話嚴對醫院裏的茶房護士也講。黃英邦爲安慰他，像安慰大多數精神病人一樣，總是這樣說：「我一定同你想法子好了。」索十億元則絕無其事。「如果我眞的要敵他竹槓，」黃醫師又說，「老早可以放他出去了。」</p>
<p>一封衛生局介紹信</p>
<p>關於衛生局的一封介紹信，其內容如下：「查本市北河南路桃源坊三十九號市民嚴培興，現患精神病，其家屬親友願自費送入該院療治，相應通知收容爲要。右通知普慈療養院。局長張維。」記者昨天往訪張維局長未遇，據曹主任秘書說，在二月七日，袁寳英帶了嚴培興寫的怪字倏及照片等面見張局長申請，二月八日張局長在公事上批「可介紹入普慈療養院」，於是衛生局就發出那封介紹信了。</p>
<p>一連串的復雜矛盾</p>
<p>指嚴培興有精神病的袁寳英，昨天又說嚴的精神病是有遺傳性的，他祖母有精神病，他妺妹亦有精神病，二十一嵗病發時，會赤身露體，但嚴培興則說絕無其事。還有他們的女兒，最大的一個十五歲，記者昨天問她爸爸究竟有沒有神經病，她說有是有一點的，進醫院後她還時常去探望。後來記者把這事問嚴培興，嚴說他女兒幫母親，他的圖章等就是被女兒來偷去。袁寳英文說她爲嚴培興的病，曾在身上割過一塊肉給他吃。嚴培興在記者問他有無此事時，笑笑說，「過去的不必說了」。而此時在嚴旁邊的親屬，則說起嚴背上有一刀痕，是袁寳英所刺，嚴聽了也笑笑，好像不願意宣露。這一連串的複雜，矛盾，眞是一個大大的謎—嚴培興究竟有沒有精神病？（未完接右下角）</p>

<h3 id="c91">楊虎太太證明信　為侯參議員辯白 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>（本文接自左上角）嚴培興送進醫院時，究竟有沒有武裝同志挾持？這是本案的第二個焦點。袁賣英昨天說，當時曾請虹口警察分局警察兩人協助，武裝軍人則並無其事。記者昨天又曾問普慈療養院中人，嚴送到醫院時有沒有武裝人物，他們說是已經記不淸楚了。據嚴袁的大女兒說，當去時一共兩輛汽車，一輛中坐的她爸爸，媽媽，與表兄（即袁寳英的內姪），另一輛坐些汗麼人則不知道。</p>
<p>嚴培興進療養院後，他開設的華興五金廠如何改了東南五金廠，又如何侯寄遠做了總經理？這是本案的第三個焦點。昨天袁寳英的招待會中，有一封楊虎太太田淑君於三十日在南京寫後當夜夜車帶滬的證明書，原文內容如下：「茲爲證明侯寄遠君絕無侵佔嚴氏廠屋生財事，緣三十五年底，嚴師母因廠中生財冬被其姪兒搬走一事，相求董竹君協助，董竹君女士即以此項不平之事告予本人，並求竭力協助，本人遂託侯參議員向警局報請追回嚴氏廠內被搬去物件，後經警局查獲，將原件一一搬回，交予嚴君收執，此時嚴君因受其姪欺侵，急成神經病，未能到廠工作，廠內事皆交由嚴師母執掌，故是嚴君因急成疾，遂入普慈醫院診治，至今猶在院中，而廠中事務繁重，即聘侯寄遠爲該廠總經理，僅爲名義職，其實際責任由嚴師母之內姪掌管，不意嚴君之姪兒復又聳恿工人搬走生財物件，且誣告侯君與嚴師母有曖昧侵佔等情，實屬謠言惑衆，該姪兒如此揑造，令八髮指，本爲持正義，不容此歹徒歪曲事實，故予證明侯君爲人正直熱心，絕無侵佔等事，而嚴氏姪兒實應負違法欺侵毀譽等過失」云云。</p>
<p>錦江的女老闆承認「抱不平」</p>
<p>担任中問介紹的董竹君女士，是錦江川菜館的老闆，在戰前經營紗布生意而與嚴培興夫婦認職的朋友；昨天她在招待會中一口承認這事完全是她「激於義憤」，因袁寳英爲廠中財產被丈夫的姪兒侵佔，到她那裏來哭訴，求她幫忙。她「抱不平」，才轉請田淑君楊虎，而由侯寄遠來代爲「整理」，僅担任名義而已。『侯先生還貼了很多錢。」董女士說，「所以現在發生這種事，我眞覺得對不起他。」華興廠爲什麼改名爲東南，袁寳英說，這是因爲他丈夫發神經病，廠內攪得一塌糊塗，對外開出去的支票退票極多，信譽掃地，所以把她丈夫送到醫院去診治，同時請別人來改名整理。</p>
<p>然而，嚴培興方面與無錫同鄉會就理直氣壯的指出：即使聘侯寄遠爲經理，嚴培興又沒有死，他的華興廠如何可以改名爲東南？侯寄遠又如何可以出面向社會局登記？侯寄遠用市參議會公事箋在廠中寫的通告，已由他們攝成照片，作爲證據之一。</p>
<p>這一件複雜的家處糾紛，牽涉到軍人醫院，市參議員，極盡光怪陸離之至，而探索其根源，則是一筆鉅大財產的作祟。嚴培興的五金廠財產價値，據說約三百億元，雖然他與她的親屬或外人都絕對否認有覬　他財產的企圖，但這件案子在不久的將來勢必見之於法庭。</p>
<p>且待法醫鑑定</p>
<p>嚴培興與袁寳英兩人，從外表上看來，都是忠厚老實的相貌，但兩人的情感竟破裂到如此地步。這一件案子的結果，將視四月十二日法醫來鑑定嚴培興是否有精神病而定，因爲袁寳英已經向法院方面聲請「禁止嚴培興治產」，法院原已定期四月十二日上午十時派法醫會同普慈療養院的鑑定醫生共同鑑定。這一件轟動上海的「瘋人」之謎，到那時候當可大白了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自軍政機關公款存匯辦法實施後，中央銀行爲推行庫政，協助同業對於各代庫行局代解軍政公款之頭寸，歷經儘量代爲調撥，予以便利。並經訂定「三行兩局，依照軍政機關公款存匯辦法，轉匯庫款，向中央銀行申請，免費調撥頭寸辦法」，通函各分行處查照辦理。惟以往調撥地點，漫無標準。例如在四川代解款項，有指定在廣州調還者，旣與事實不符，且亦有違政府金融管制政策之意旨。茲悉：財政部新訂國庫出納會計制度，已定自三十七年起實行，各地庫款收支報解程序，一槪採用分區承轉制度。所有各區內之庫款調撥事宜，均責由各代區分庫之中央銀行分別辦理。嗣後各行局代庫轉匯庫款之頭寸，當由各代區分庫辦理，並儘量予以便利。然調撥地點，自亦應以匯款到達行所在地所屬區域範圍內爲限，不得越區調撥，藉顯事實，而符政府對金融管制政策之旨。</p>

<p>本年度我國對外易貨，中央信託局仍奉令織續加强推進中。我國對外各國之易貨，以對日本，美國，及蘇聯等爲最多。目前對日易貨，仍以輸入人造絲及枕木爲主；輸出則以大豆糖爲主。日本急需之鹽，因鹽政總局至今尙未核准本年度可供易貨之數量，故本年度尙無鹽輸出。據關係方面表示，若對日食鹽易貨無法恢復，前途則難望樂觀。且去年度我欠日本之易貨賬，目前亦急待償還淸算。至對美易貨，本年度尙未見有大量輸出或輸入，所易者大部份茶葉桐油及猪鬃。惟美國方面常批評我國現有之輸出貨物，其品質較前爲差，往往以同等之價格，無法購得同等之貨物，此點係有關國際貿易之信譽，甚盼各經管當局及貸款當局嚴格管理，使其提高品質，以利輸出。對蘇易貨，大部份均爲輸出，而少輸入。本年度因政府尙未核准其物資名單及數量，故尙未正式展開。至其他各國之易貨數量均極少，最近輸出當局鼓勵以我國之特產瓷器及爆竹向國外推銷，如銷路旺盛，換回之外匯及物資亦頗可彌補外匯開支云。</p>

<h3 id="c136">「國民大會制度論述」評介 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 黃鴻昌</p>
<p>陳玉祥著　商務印書館印行　三百十五頁　定價七元</p>
<p>國民大會是中國未來的新政府中特有的一個機構，是憲政時期代表全國國民行使政權的機構；又因中華民國的憲法係田其制定的，所以又爲訓政時期進入憲政時期的唯一橋樑。國民大會因而也有「制憲的」和「行憲的」之別。對於這樣一個機構的理論和制度我們早渴望有一本有系統的著作來加以分析，前數月購到陳玉祥君所著「國民大會制度論述」一書，研讀之餘，覺得陳君此書頗有相當價値。</p>
<p>制憲的國民大會方於三十五年召開，但對於這一問題的紛爭，却自從有了孫中山先生的建國大綱以後便已存在，國民大會的籌備舉行，也已有了十多年的歷史。坊間所出「國民大會參老資料」「國民大會問題」或「國民大會特輯」一類的書籍，雖已　見不鮮，然而這些都不外是些法規或片斷論著的搜集，若要找一本有體糸的較深刻的專門著述，就筆者的見聞，却不得不推陳君此書。</p>
<p>本害共分九章，第一章「民主政治之原理與方式」，在這約一萬字的篇幅中，說明了很抽象的民主政治的一般原理，及紛雜的民主定義和觀念，以近代代議政治的流弊，進而解答：一現在我們不在民治政體的應否採用，而在於它究竟應該採用何種方式使最能避免它特有的各種弊病。」第二章「中國實行民主政治之進程，」從訓政體制的確立說起，一直到憲法的制定，說明了中國如何進入於民主政治。第三章「中國民主政制之特性，」對於整個中國憲法的精神及新政府的中央政制有很重要的闡發。這最初的三章可說是本書的第一部份。</p>
<p>第四章「國民大會之籌開」，第五章「國民大會組織法之演變。」這兩章都是指制憲的國大而言。制憲的國大雖然開過一次會就算完了，其任務的重大則是空前的，其召開的經過，組成份子的演變，情節却又極其複雜。著者在這兩章中，不特將國民大會召開的史實和它的組織法加以叙述和分析而已。最値得稱許的，是著者將國民大會歷次延期舉行的背景，政治協商會議召開的因果，制憲的國民大會組織法代表選舉法的立法意旨，技術上的問題，及其與五五憲草的關聯或抵觸之處都提示給讀者。我們讀這兩章，可見著者對這一問題研究的透澈。這兩章是本書的第二部份。</p>
<p>從第六章到第九章是本書的第三部份，也是本書最主要部份，佔全書篇幅的二分之一。第六章述國民大會制度的設計歷程，十多年來國人對國民大會制度的各種研討和擬議，在本章中都加以簡扼的介紹和評論。第七章是純理論的研究，主旨在闡發國民大會性質的細微。在這一童中，著者把政權。治權。統治權。主權……等等名詞的界限和岐異說得很透澈，對於國民大會爲什麼是政權機關一點尤其有獨到的見解，道人之所未道。第八九章是國民大會代表的選舉罷免和他們在開會時的職權。中華民國憲法國民大會章共計倏文十條，在第七·八·九章中中都有詳細的析述，有關的行憲法規亦常加以必要的引述。</p>
<p>這本書的體系大致如此。從整個來講，這本書把國民大會的史實，組織，職權……一句話，理論和制度的各方面都有相富的論述了。在每一章之後並有附註數十條，或對正文作必要的註釋，或列出參名資料的來源，凡此具徵著者著述此書頗爲負責。全書的文字亦很流利，以寫述這樣一本硬性的書，而能有這樣不感枯燥的文字已是很不容易的了。只可惜需名反沒有內容容易引起人的注意，因爲論述兩字容易被人誤會爲述而不作之意，所以我希望著者索性就稱爲「國民大會制度」或其他更適當的書名，不知著者以爲然否？</p>
<p>有一點，我們期望著者的，就是這本書是去年五月中完成的，而國大代表配額的決定却是以後的事。所以有些選舉法規及選舉技術上的問題未及加以論列。這一點，我們自可原諒著者，著者在校後記中亦已說及將來如有再版機會，當加以增訂和修正。我們覺得這本書很完美，値得學術界的注意，但爲更臻完善起見，我們希望它即有再版本問世。</p>
<h3 id="c137">十字路上的進步教育 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>Progressive　Education　at　the　Crossroads　Boyd　H．Bode原著。</p>
<p>秦希廉譯</p>
<p>三十六年十月正中書局初版</p>
<p>「十字路上之進步教育」是現代敎育哲學的名著，作者波特（Boyd　H．Bode）是美國聲名卓著的哲學敎授．他的著作如「敎育哲學大意」（Fundamentals　of　Education）「現代教育學說」（Modern　Educational　Theories）「學習心理辨歧」（Conflicting　Psychlolgy　of　Learning）均有中譯本，傳誦一時。這本書顧名思義，是敍說徬徨在歧路上的各種敎育思想，和進步敎育的本質。在敎育思想上爭辯很久的許多觀念，作者均加以客觀的闡述，指出敎育的新路。書中給我們指出進步思想所依據的哲學。這種哲學的內容，誠如波氏所說是由於進步遝動所注重的「尊重個性」和「最大限度的發展」的含義內引伸出來的。</p>
<p>進步敎育是一種哲學思想，也是一種泛行於社會的遝動，它是基於自由主義和民主理想而生長，而形成。它的顯著的含義是「兒童中心」，也就是說，它包括着「興趣」「自動」以及「自由」這些概念。在心理方面，進步敎育傾向於「由做中學」（Learning　by　doing）的原則；在社會方面，它着重個性發展，强調協作互助的價值。</p>
<p>作者在序文中說：「若要把敎育當作成人的一種有價值的職業，它必須以一種社會組織的哲學爲基礎。」他堅持尊重個性與最大限度之發展，爲一個戰鬥的學說。波氏認爲進步敎育的實踐主要的是使敎育活動能代表一種正確的生活方式，這觀論是很對的。</p>
<p>開始便討論進步敎育和民主主義的關係。進步敎育尊重自由，然而也重視指導；看重方法，然而不泥於傳統的課程；注意個性發展，然而也看重社會制度。因爲重視個性，所以極反對「强施」（Imposition），敎育在充分發展個人運用智慧的自由的能力。一切足以阻礙個性與智慧發展的傅統信仰和態度，均須加以改造修正。</p>
<p>對於自由敎育（Liheral　education）和專技敎育(Technical　education），彼氏認爲並不對立，二者的分別，不是說前者專事追求眞理；後者純粹尋求實際結果。這中間不啻說明了藝術與職業的調和。專技敎育的過於趨向於機械的訓練是錯誤的，它也可能發展學生的欣賞能力。作者說：「專技敎育若達到使學生覺得它是包括一種整個生活方式的地步時，它便成爲自由化了。」</p>
<p>興趣學說衆說紛紜，作者從進步敎育的心理親點·他認興趣大半由環境所決定，不是完全內在的。努力與興趣有關，環境的誘力包括敎師的啓發，良好敎學動境的利川，都是培養興趣的要素。我們常誤解興趣爲無限度的茫然投其所好，看了波氏的論斷，我們也會明瞭糖衣式的敎育不能代表進步敎育。興趣的眞義應該是「　敎　成爲一種向着總括範型以不斷地改造經驗爲中心的程序。……並不是由外面强施的權　而得，乃是由學生運用其本身的智力而得。」</p>
<p>在「一個美國的文化範型」一節中，作者說美國的文化着重在培養智力而非服從權威·這種敎育制度是不承認某些絕對的或最後的眞理，因爲它們對於社會進步以及對於經　不斷改造和充實都有限制。進　　思想和敎育，純視是否爲　社會全體生活的目標依照互惠或合作的關係而定。他有兩句極中肯的話：「我們的敎育理論，必須變爲一種社會關係的理論，或是一種民主主義的理論。」</p>
<p>杜威博士早已闡發過「敎育即生長」的意義，波特更參以新近的研究，進一步發揮此中眞意，他就「敎育爲不斷地改組經驗的程序，詮釋何謂生長以及生長的方向。生長或指那主動力全由學生內發；或指學生對於敎師所作提示之滿意的反應。作者警告敎師不要完全迷信「內心生長」而不予適當的指導；也不能全憑敎師一己的偏見而進行不正確「外在指導」强制學生肓目接受。</p>
<p>作者怵於一般敎師的過分重視敎材，而忽略敎育的眞義，提出「要敎兒童不要敎學科」這個原理。他指出固定的課程和敎材如何阻塞學生思想的發展和心智的生長。的確，敎材只是達到敎育目的的一種手段，一種方法，一種工具，敎育的目的仍在行爲的改變。各種學科和敎材必須眞能達到「敎化」和陶鑄品格的目的才有價値之可言。「傳統敎育」不顧兒意的天性。……指定功課當作定量學習的材料，並不顧及心理生長的法則或原理。整個程序變成機械化，犧牲了精神或態度。」是的，受敎育和受敎材是判然不同的，前者是精神的感悟，態度的改變；後者則只是形式的訓練，外力的强制。</p>
<p>最後歸納到「敎育的社會性」的討論，波氏認爲進步敎育的理想應符合民主社會的理想，因此一種解釋正確的社會關係的社會哲學也便成爲研究敎育者所不能忽視的了。</p>
<p>本書內容雖不能說怎樣充實，但却代表一種進步敎育的看法。譯筆似稍欠流暢，如果能取直譯方法，或者可以更中國化一些，比較更易了解其思想的底蘊。但是譯哲理的書籍本非易事，在譯者確已費過相當的心力，爲了「力求正確」自然不能不直譯。我想，對敎育學已具根基，平日習於閱讀英文書或翻譯本的人也決不致感到多少困難。繆天瑞著萬葉書店印行</p>

<p>— 培元</p>
<p>記得在福建音專的時候，常常接到外間要音樂敎材和詢問各種　　敎材敎法的信，那時　零零碎碎的寄一些講義出去，敎學上的困難，除了作些　略的解答外，也指導他們找幾本書看看，但是戰時的出版界，速那僅有的幾本勉强可用的書，也是絕版似的，無處可買。最近兩年，輾轉台浙，和音樂敎師及未來的音樂敎師接觸尤多，這一方面書籍的需要也就更加急切起來，月前到金華旅行，在書店裏發現一本繆天瑞先生著的小學音樂敎材及敎學法，看看這書寫到得那樣周詳新穎，眞是喜出望外，所以願意執筆來向全國音樂敎師和師範學校學生介紹：</p>
<p>這書本文一百十三面，分爲儿章，第一章唱歌敎材選擇法中，提出歌詞應當口語化，不可永遠唱一二人的作品，免使兒實音樂趣味變狹，這都是經驗之談，第三章視唱敎學法中，提出寫譜法與指譜歌唱，這是一般敎師所忽視的，第四章唱歌一般敎學法中，提出坐位能力分組，這是對學習和管理極有帮助的一件事，同一章中起唱呼拍，也是一般敎師是常犯的毛病，第五章發聲法與高度矯正法中，鄭重指出兒童唱歌發聲，第一要務是用頭聲發聲，小聲歌唱，與向高音發展，目前的小學校中，不知有多少敎師選些音域很低的歌，敎兒童拼命喊，弄得他們的聲帶損壞，一生不能再發美妙的歌聲！同一章中提出變聲期怎樣唱歌的問題，普通的敎師，只知道變聲期不宜唱歌，但是沒有樂器或其他設備的學校，兒童在變聲期不唱歌，對音樂因此疏遠陌生，這豈不是一個很大的損失　第七章其他音樂活動，這是小學音樂敎學上最需要而又是一般音樂敎本中最少提及的材料，本章作者提出唱歌遊嬉，音樂家故事，聽音寫譜，音樂會等，讀者不難舉一反三，得到許多提高兒童興趣和學習效能的種種方法的啓示吧！第九章設備及其他，有風琴修理法，這是給小學敎師最實惠的指導了，同一章又提及美國的音樂督導制度，這在我國，無疑還是一種奢望，但是願意促起教育行政當局的注意，在不久的將來，有輔助音樂敎師發展音樂敎育的這種良好制度的設立！</p>
<p>此外，全書的文字簡明流暢，附有唱歌敎材很多，這也都是本書的時點，美中不足的地方，是種種說明及歌曲都用簡譜，然而有印刷經驗和知道現在大多數小學音樂敎師還只能看簡譜的朋友，當不難同情作者在自序中「方便於印刷，只得暫用簡譜」和「有機會再版時，將悉數改爲五綫譜」的話！</p>

<p>一個人的靈魂和生命的活力是煆煉而俞能堅强的。我之　讀傳記，便是可以從他人的經歷中、發現了這一個眞理；在寂寞的時候，它給我精神上的依偎，在受着不斷的挫折時，它給我伸出援手，使我市新爬起來。因爲人是有一種很强的憎晉庸俗的本能，而傳記是以簡單的現實的叙述，使我們和人類數千年的歷史裏所有最不平凡的人得以親近，給我們種種精神的響應，使我們的生活有色彩，使我們的心有力量，這就是　　　　記的原因。</p>
<p>俄國的大詩人尼古拉梭夫，他的生平和著作，被介紹到我國來的，直到現在仍似很少，現在出版他這本傳記，是値得我們一讀的。</p>
<p>繼普式庚和萊蒙托夫之後，俄國的大詩人便是尼古拉梭夫了。其實他的地位並不亞於他們，它斯妥也夫斯基後來在追念尼古拉梭夫時會說：「尼古拉梭夫是可以和普式庚，萊蒙托夫居於同列的詩人。」他的輝皇的成就和留給文學上的遺產，在之都使他獲得崇高的地位。詩人的家庭　中外古今的詩人，不幸的都不能擺脫窮愁潦倒的厄運，但是以尼古拉梭夫這樣的才華橫逸，刻苦自勵的詩人，竟曾渝爲乞丐，這也許是較其他詩人的際過，更爲悽慘的了。他是一八二一年十二月四日生於柏德里·斯加郎縣的一個小郡猶茲維那。他的父親是一個地主，退伍眾人，生活放蕩，嗜酒好賭，性情暴戾，尼古拉梭夫在他的詩中，把他的父親呌做一倔强的無敎育者」，「暴君」，「虐殺者」，和「刑吏」。他的母親是愛好音樂和文學的婦人。因此尼古拉梭夫在這樣不同的性格的雙親影響下，使他自然地走向憎惡虐待，反抗暴戾，藉文學為發揮自己意志的工具了；少年的時代他便成了「區衆的呻吟興淚的歌手」。</p>
<p>一八三八年，他十七歲，這時他離開家庭到首都去，然而他除了帶有長篇小說的原稿和一些詩稿在身邊外，袋子裏遭一個戈比也沒有，以這樣的勇氣進身文壇，他弄到沒有東西吃，沒有地方住的情景，外套也沒有便挨過冬天。祗有像他這樣不屈不撓的人，才能够忍受得起和極度貧困作艱苦的鬥　。</p>
<p>兩年的工作　八四一的兩年中，他寫了幾乎可以和其他作家終身的創作量相比的短歌，論文，雜感，詩，短篇中篇小說和評論。這成就是驚人的，從這裏已可想見他在艱苦中的工作毅力是多歷的偉大。以後他還是以同樣的精神繼續寫作，到晚年時他回憶過去的生活情形寫道：「好幾次徹夜沒有休息地寫着，差不多是一分一秒的間斷都沒有，終於兩脚麻痺起來，失去感覺了。燈點着，或晝或夜，在我完全沒有區別。時間到的時候，去幹別的工作，過後又回到這工作上來了。」</p>
<p>尼古拉梭夫和著名批評家培林斯基的相識，是詩人生活最重要的轉換期。培林斯基用最高的誠摯扶植他，使他拋棄了從前華麗的詩句，開始爲作被虐待被苦鍊的人們生活了。本傳記的作者說：「他的詩的基調，爲了憂鬱的節奏，直情的哀哭及涕泣的緣故，而成爲極少見的咒咀與怨言。柔靱的韻律，成爲緩和的音響與言辭的不斷的流動。這些詩幾乎是由寒凍，飢餓，壓制，病苦和貧困所產生的人間的苦惱的證據。」這是尼古拉梭夫的詩的本色，但是這全是受到培林斯基所影響的。</p>
<p>後進的作家　尼古拉梭夫晚年收買了由普式庚創刋的雜誌「現代」的發行權，以後他的工作便集中在編輯雜誌上了。由於編輯這雜誌的關係，他培植了不少優秀新進的作家，像它斯妥也夫斯基，岡察洛夫，和托爾斯泰等，都是由他替他們開拓了道路的。這是値得大書特書的事。直到一八七七年十二月二十七日這一生爲藝術而苦鬥英勇的詩人病逝了。</p>
<p>這本傳記是叙述，詩人一生奮鬥的經歷和他的偉大成就。展開在我們面前的是發揮了對於美善的材幹，建造高貴的人格，和境遇奮鬥以期達到生活最後的目的。外國的藝術家中，有許多人讀了文斯Leonard　da　Vinci）的傅記而奮起的。現在我們的生活和環境正陷入無氣力的，倦怠的憂鬱的情緒之中，我們正想要趕快從這種感情的東縛中脫身出來。這時候我們若讀了人家的傳記至陷進了和我們自己一樣的試練之中的地方，便曾感到輕鬆不少；同時讀我們所景仰的先進如何經過了憂鬱期的奮鬥，這自然是可以做我們一種警惕和鼓舞。尼古拉梭夫傳就是給我們在向窮困抗爭中的一本很好的傳記。</p>

<h3 id="c140">說萬愚 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>西洋人創萬愚節，大槪屬於歐美上流社會的文人雅事之一，其屬炫奇鬥智，同於中國的詩鐘文虎，不過情趣上略有東西流風的差別。自從歐風東漸之後，萬愚節也移植到中國來，尤其是近年來的新聞版面上，每遇四月一日，因被緊張的政局刺激着人們的「新聞頭腦」，記　們爲要鬆懈讀者的情緒，常是排幾段「愚人」新聞來調劑下，使讀卡在被「愚」之後，引起一陣哈哈。這也許是合乎「一張一弛，文武之道，」原屬無可厚非。</p>
<p>鄙人每天讀報，深感到生長在今日的中國，最好年年過的是四月一日，好使我們讀到某幾條令人沮喪的消息，只當是新聞社的「愚人」消息，而感到事實也許不盡然的安慰。四强管制德國的協定破裂了嗎？不是，一個愚人消息而已。日本想援養大利的後塵，要討回冲繩島嗎？不是的，是東京放送過來的「愚人」新聞。諸如此類，說也難畫，假若盡是玩的「愚人」手腕，豈非世界之幸？本來「人生於世」，除了惡意的欺騙之外，也是你騙騙我，我騙騙你，用善意的欺騙，來减少相互之間的爭執，以及維特紳士型的和善而已。因此明明是出洋游玩，偏說是患病就醫，或者研究地理；明明是一隻鹿，可以指成一隻馬；明明是討厭小孩生氣蓬勃的玩鬧，偏偏要嚇孩子以「老虎來了，要　最量吵鬧的孩子吃掉」……從這一點看來，好弄詭譎的西洋人還不及中國人的善用「萬愚」的手腕。他們只是定了一個節日，規定僅是在四月一日可以愚人，而中國人却是無時無刻不想用愚人的方法，來彌補一個破落紳士的塲面，或者是完成一個自私的目的。我們只看見四月一日報紙上登載着某某幾段的愚人消息，却已被無刻時無不在製造中的「愚人」言行所麻木，豈是創造萬愚節的西洋人所能始料及哉？</p>
<p>再想一想，萬愚節的愚人消息，又豈是眞的「愚」人嗎？大部份製浩出來的故事，在表面上看來是「愚人」的，但其內在的含義也許就代表了一種意向，一個眞理。例如假定今日報上有人刋載一段愚人新聞，說是定於四月十六日將要發行種幣値固定的硬幣，以代替今日的法幣。這一種消息是迎合讀者的心理，也是表示一般人的意向是歡喜幣値固定的通貨。還有假定今日有人製造一段消息，說是某某影星因情變自殺，這果然使關心某某影星者爲之侷促不安，同時利用了某某影星的號召力，吸引讀者去細看「愚人」的報導，其實却說明了一個近世玩弄戀愛者的一條悲慘的途徑。</p>
<p>製造愚人新聞的人自以爲是鈎心鬥角，掉弄了一枝彩筆在愚騙人家，殊不知他自己並不「聰明」到如何地步，因爲他自己處於一個大圈子的愚人世界中。而嘔心嚦血製造出來的愚人新聞呢，也許不足以愚人，倒是用另一種方法洩露了一點自然的「天機」—即說偈曰：</p>
<p>堪笑愚人者，</p>
<p>人亦在愚你，</p>
<p>茫茫天地間，</p>
<p>愚人即愚已！</p>
<p>其實非愚人，</p>
<p>此中有眞理。</p>
<p>西洋萬愚節，</p>
<p>中國小玩意。</p>
<h3 id="c141">說謊萬歲 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 易楚</p>
<p>曾見到過這樣一個故事：一家人家生了一個男孩，合家高興透頂，滿月的時候抱出來給客人看，大槪自然想　一點好兆頭。</p>
<p>一個說：「這孩子將來要發財的。一他於是得到一番感謝。</p>
<p>一個說：「這孩子將米要做官的。」他於是收回幾句恭維。</p>
<p>一個說：「這孩子將來是要死的。」他於是得到一頓大家合力的痛打。</p>
<p>孩子要死是必然的眞實的，但說出來却受了痛打。至於發財做官，還是渺茫得很，但不着邊際的虛僞的話，反而得到人家歡喜。說話的藝術，前二位客人是懂得的，他們巧妙地應用了。</p>
<p>推而廣之：一個娶有五個姨太太的假道學，他也會大駡世道淪亡，人心不古，居然組織起「風俗整頓會」來。一個囤積投機的奸商，他也會痛駡奸商沒有良心，要求政府嚴属取締。至於貪官汚吏，那當然說起來他是最廉潔的，兩袖淸風，愛民如子。有時候—一個多月不剃頭，穿一件灰布皺長衫的時候—偶然碰到了闊朋友，我連寒喧話都不曾開口，他就嘆起窮來，好像他特地找我米訴苦似的。而且，聽他的口氣，窮得家裏幾乎要不能生火，非別人周濟不可，雖然他不曾向我伸手，我倒反而嚇得提早與他分別了。老媽子們逢着女主人給她們賞錢，也會一只手儘往後藏，口裏不住的說：「不要不要。」但如果眞的另一只手沒上來接錢，那一定是還嫌着少罷了。女太太們閒談來，你聽她們說：「張太太眞漂亮，一天要費去三個鐘頭去化裝，我是媽媽虎虎算了。李太太私房錢有幾十億，我是一個錢也積不起。」好像在自嫌不會打扮和沒有私房。共實實在告訴你：她是天生美貌不用化裝；丈夫的錢由她管制，毋用私藏。如果不像孔老夫子那樣「聽其言而觀其行」，那你一定要受　了！</p>
<p>說話如果也有藝術的話，那就是說謊話。</p>
<h3 id="c142">「報銷政治」 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>我常覺得中國官僚有二大絕技，決非外國人所能及到。這二大絕技就是：（一）辦報銷；（二）做工作報告。至於是否能够令出必行，或者「工作」曾否澈底做好，却彷彿都是次要的事。祗要整整齊齊的報銷上去，把整筆的公款領到，便算是工作業已推動；等到大疊的工作報告自下而上一層層的一個圈子兜完，塵封在某一官衙的某一個冷僻的角落時——好，「工作」業已完成，考績就可以有所根據了。</p>
<p>無以名之，名之謂「報銷政治」。</p>
<p>「報銷政治」的最標準的一個例子，就是最近上海電信局之忽然又要舉辦全市無綫電收音機登記，而且限期在三月底截止。剛發表這件事情的時候，口氣是相當嚴厲的。三月底已經到了，登記的成績如何呢，我昨天碰到一位在電信局工作多年的老同學，便問他倒底怎樣。他不禁哈哈大笑，說：「外國人登記的倒不少！」至於中國人呢，他說就是電信局本身的職員們，也大多不加理踩——連住在電信局宿舍裏面的職員的收音機也沒有登記。</p>
<p>我聽了也笑起來，就問他：「如果過了三月底還不去登記，電信局有什麼處分罷？」</p>
<p>他說：「恐怕不至於。」</p>
<p>事實上電信局如果竟要爲了遺漏登記而處分用戶的話，我們倒很願意聽一聽他們有什麼法律根據。而且，電信局又有什麼辦法可以知道用戶遺漏登記呢？派調查員出來調查嗎？那麼我們倒還要問一句：如果我偏關起門來不准他進來調查又怎麼樣？電信局又根據了那一條法律才有權來搜查人民的住宅？値此憲政肇始之際，政府機關是絕對應當率先倡導守法之風的！</p>
<p>上海的老百姓一天到晚爲了衣食奔走，已經忙得不可開交，在公事完畢之後，不賭錢，不跳無，回到家裏安安份份的坐在沙法襄抽支香烟聽聽無綫電，可說是再循規蹈矩沒有的最起碼的享受了，照我看是政府應當獎勵之不迭的，而現在偏要從平安無事中想出些毫無必要的花樣出來麻煩人民，難道眞的是惟恐不能取壓於人民麼！</p>
<p>今日政府如要洗刷「無能」之議，第一樁事情便是亟需養成一種樸樸實實脚踏實地做事的風氣。無綫電收音機登記這件事情，我看一先是來一個「辦理不及，展期一月」，到一個月後便像戲館挽留名角似的來一個「再展一月」，大槪到　、次展期一月後，根本大家已對這件事情漸漸淡忘，而電信局就也乘此收蓬，就此算數——又可以開始起草「工作報告」了。以雷厲風行始，以虎頭蛇尾終，這是「報銷政治」的一套公式，大槪不大會有例外。但「報銷政治」却正是「樸樸實實脚踏實地的作風」的反面，收音機登記的事情雖小，我們却從中又淸楚地看到了「無能」兩個大字！</p>

<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>社會上的任何事情，逃不了人與事的關係。有些人御下甚嚴，而辦事媽虎；有些人對人與對事，一貫嚴厲的作風，言出必行，稍一拖延，扑責隨之，這些人不但使人肅然起敬，而且使人望而生畏。在我的回憶中，小學時代好用敎鞕「打手心」的算術敎師，差堪作這一型的代表·</p>
<p>誠然，人與事的關係，異常密切，二者不易劃分。辦事嚴格，免不了遭人之忌，或得罪人家。而八面玲瓏，左右逢源的人，往往對事敷衍塞責了事。因此，社會上不少辦事業的人，常常想在對人與對事間，找出一條兩全其美的中庸之逍，旣可將事情辦好，在人事上也不致　出別扭。這自然是一樁很不容易的工作，因爲處理稍一不愼，也許拂逆甚多，適得相反的結果。</p>
<p>不久前，我從某出版家那裏却得到了一些啓發。他將稿件交給印刷所付排後，約定交件日期，不准遲延。但是平時對於印刷所如有資金局轉不靈情事，酌加接濟，恩威並用，結果各印刷所都願意替他效勞。此公所採用的方法，簡言之，就是：「對人寬厚，對事認眞」。引伸其義，他對於平日接觸的人，絕未疾言厲色，而對於一件事，在規定日期內，却非辦好不可。與他相知有素的人，摸熟他的脾氣，也不敢托詞延宕了。我想上文所述的八個字，至少足抵半部人事管理學吧。</p>

<p>齋又想父親年齡已大，母親又多病，姊姊又　在漢口，要離開老人家是很不放心的，並且老人家也未必能答應。要是在老人家面前撒謊，說銀行派出去，幾天就回來，他當然沒什麼不贊成了，可是自己一走，老不回來，老人家一定不放心。渚齋爲了這事，躊躇竟日，不能解決。到得晚上，接到雲鄉的一封信，打開一看，上面寫道：「渚：今天你所說的話，我考慮半天，一切環境都不許可的。我的意志，前天晚上已經和你澈底表示過，始終不會搖動，我又不願意你爲我頹喪，貽誤前途，思維再三，只有你回家去，在萬分失望之中，還可以得一絲的安慰。你的精神，要寄託在事業上，名譽上，不要像以前，顛倒在情海裏。你一向聽我的話，這是我最後的供獻，我想你一定要採納的。我已經寫信給鳳笙，我想你回家去，一定能得到鳳笙的諒解。這樣一來，你得了安慰，你父母得了安慰，我也得了安慰了。卿。」渚齋看完了這封信，縐着眉頭，自言自語道：「繞來繞去，還是這主張，不去呢？辜負她一番好意，去呢？實在是沒意思。」拿了這封信，在屋內繞來繞去，想了好一會，才決定了，若不去，雲卿知道了一定會見怪的，不如去一趨。鳳笙再有拒絕的表示，我在雲卿面前，更有材料報告。渚齋想定主意，立刻穿好衣服，出去雇車，立時趕到北新橋，到了門口，見大門虛掩，輕輕推開進去。走到院內，剛碰見鳳笙，拿了一把茶壺從屋裏出來，一見渚齋，大聲問道：「你來幹什麼？」渚齋心裏本很委曲，見鳳笙這種能度，很想韓頭就走，後來一想，這次事情，原是我對不住她，今天受她一點氣，也是應當。如此一想，反對鳳笙一笑，走進屋內。鳳笙仍板着面孔，把茶壺送進廚房，重走出來，渚齋含着笑臉站在屋內相迎，鳳笙連理也不理，一直走進裏間屋內。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Vandenberg Strongly Advocates Supporting Our Country, US Senate Passes Aid to China Bill, Shanghai Circles Urge US Congress to Approve Quickly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Washington, 30th] Today, the Senate passed legislation to aid China with $463 million over one year through a voice vote. This action was taken after Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vandenberg urged passage of the bill. Vandenberg hopes that by the end of this weekend, a final resolution can be reached on the disagreements between the Senate and House versions of the various foreign aid bills.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] When the Senate passed the aid to China bill today, Vandenberg delivered a speech in the Senate, stating in brief: "During World War II, China was one of the countries that suffered the most significant blows. In this great war, China was always our loyal ally against the Axis powers, bearing the brunt of Japan's attacks and occupation, but always refusing any separate peace opportunities. However, the victory over the Axis powers has not ended China's dangers. The fruits of victory have not benefited China. China is still suffering from civil war, and its government is constantly attacked by armed Communists, becoming a victim of aggressive conspiracies that undermine world peace.</p>
<p>"It is not surprising that China is on the brink of danger under all these significant burdens and accumulated difficulties. What is surprising is that all the crises have failed to break China's courageous spirit to continue its efforts. We must frankly admit the urgency of the current situation. But in my opinion, if we do not make every effort to support and encourage the Chinese government and the Chinese people to resist aggression and maintain independence at this time, we will be disloyal to our own goals."</p>
<p>[This City News] Speaker Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, along with leaders from all sectors of Shanghai, sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart on the 29th of last month, requesting him to forward it to the leaders of the US Congress and all its members, urging the passage of the $463 million aid to China bill to prevent the Red invasion. The telegram was led by Speaker Pan and signed by university presidents and others.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Democratic Senator Magnuson proposed in the Senate today that at least 75 percent of the wheat shipped under the China Relief Act should be flour. It is claimed that currently, 65 percent of the wheat shipped from the Pacific Northwest to China is wheat rather than flour. This move will make bran used for copper scarce and expensive, thereby reducing milk and poultry production.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Second Preparatory Meeting of the National Assembly Passes Amendments to Organizational Law, Transferred to the National Government for Submission to the Legislative Yuan for Discussion <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The first and second preparatory meetings of the National Assembly were held at 9:20 AM on the 31st, with Hu Shih continuing to serve as temporary chairman. After the secretariat read the minutes of the first preparatory meeting, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported on the key points of the oral and written opinions expressed by various representatives at the first preparatory meeting regarding the method of electing the presidium. These key points were divided into five parts: the first part advocated increasing the number of members in the presidium; the second part advocated maintaining the original proposal; the third part concerned the number of members to be added; the fourth part concerned the method of election; and the fifth part concerned the quota for women. After Hong's report, temporary chairman Hu Shih proposed that the issue of whether to amend the National Assembly Organizational Law should be discussed first, and new opinions could also be put forward. From 10:30 AM to 10:50 AM, the atmosphere in the meeting hall reached its highest point of contention, and after 10:45 AM, it entered the voting stage. The new opinions put forward by the representatives today can be summarized into the following points: (1) According to the provisions of the National Assembly Organizational Law, 25 members are to be elected to the presidium, and a special committee is to be established, with one member from each unit serving as a committee member to assist the presidium in handling administrative matters. Members of the special committee may attend presidium meetings. (2) The original draft should be maintained in the text, but it should be evenly distributed, and a proviso should be added at the end of the article, restricting the number of incumbent officials elected to the presidium. (3) The Constitution should be followed, and the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly has no right to amend any rules. Therefore, the presidium must be elected immediately before discussion. Moreover, if we immediately propose to the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organizational Law, the Legislative Yuan may not be able to start working immediately, which will cause delays in time. (4) The quota for women should account for 20 percent of the total. Among the above points of view, the explanation of the third point is the proposition of incumbent legislator Lin Bin. His emphasis on observing the spirit of the Constitution and not having the right to amend the Organizational Law is based on legal principles, but it did not receive the sympathy of the majority at the time. It was then put to a vote. First, the motion to maintain the original plan was put to a vote, followed by a negative vote. As a result, the majority agreed to the amendment. Representative Wang Chonghui then proposed that the National Assembly Organizational Law be transferred to the National Government to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for the rapid completion of the legislative procedure for amendment, while the assembly would continue the nomination and election procedures. The opinions of the representatives on the number of people were all attached as annexes and transferred to the National Government for reference by the Legislative Yuan. Someone also suggested that if the Legislative Yuan amends the clauses of the case, it must not make rigid regulations, but only use "a certain number of people" as a flexible regulation, which was passed together. The nomination and election of the presidium could not be discussed due to time constraints.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Legislative Yuan to Meet and Discuss Within Days <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The case decided by the second preparatory meeting of the National Assembly to transfer the National Assembly Organizational Law to the National Government for submission to the Legislative Yuan to amend the clauses and complete the legislative procedure was compiled by the Secretariat of the National Assembly on the 31st and submitted to the National Government at 4 PM. It is also heard that the Legislative Yuan will convene a general assembly within days to discuss this case.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Lou Tongsun, Acting Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, told this newspaper's reporter on the 31st noon, after learning that the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly had passed a resolution requesting the National Government to order the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organizational Law (regarding the number of chairmen in the National Assembly Presidium) as soon as possible, that if the Legislative Yuan receives the order from the National Government, it will convene a temporary meeting in the shortest possible time to discuss and decide on this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Third Preparatory Meeting Today to Discuss Representative Seats <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The third preparatory meeting of the National Assembly is scheduled to be held at 9 AM on the 1st, with Chairman Yu Bin. In addition to continuing to discuss the method of electing the presidium, the method of arranging representative seats will be studied to facilitate the rapid determination of representative seats.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Ju Zheng Decides to Run for President, Advocates Laissez-Faire Governance and Stability First, and Supports Yu Youren for Vice President <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] As the capital is filled with an atmosphere of competition for the vice presidency, and Chairman Chiang is still about to announce that he will participate in the presidential election, President Ju Zheng declared to this newspaper's reporter one afternoon: He has decided to run for this year's presidency, but he said in an extremely humble tone: "This is just a matter of accompanying the election. I still hope that Chairman Chiang will be elected." When the reporter asked about his campaign platform and political views, Ju avoided answering. After repeated inquiries, Ju finally said: "I have always advocated laissez-faire governance. Recently, I gave a speech in Taiwan on 'Seeking Construction in Stability,' which can be regarded as my campaign platform and political views. According to the Constitution, the president is only the head of state, so the president actually has not much to do. It is best to adopt laissez-faire governance. At present, the bandit disaster is in full swing, and with the destruction of the Communist bandits, all construction is out of the question. My current advocacy is still 'stability first,' first suppressing the rebellion to seek stability, and then seeking construction in stability." When the reporter asked that everyone has been calling for the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the vice presidential candidates are also using the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood as a slogan, what are the president's opinions on this? Ju replied: "It is only right to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, but it is too late to implement it now, even saying it is too late. We have been carrying out the revolution for decades, what have we done in the past? Only now do we think of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood!" When talking about the tasks of this year's National Assembly, Ju said that this year's National Assembly should be limited to electing the president and vice president. It is best not to amend the Constitution, because whether the Constitution is good or bad, it is not yet known without implementation. It can only be decided whether it needs to be amended after implementation. The reporter asked him which of the four vice presidential candidates he would support.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense recently issued a statement on the National Army's future strategic actions, stating: (1) At present, in the Jiaodong area, because the National Army already has the cooperation of the navy and air force to monitor the Bohai Sea surface, especially the Changshan Islands outside Longkou and Penglai and Liugong Island outside Weihaiwei, all are under the control of the National Army. Therefore, Longkou, Penglai, Weihaiwei, and other places that have lost their military value will be abandoned so that the army can concentrate its forces to attack the main force of the bandits and launch mobile attacks. (2) The National Army's successful withdrawal strategy from Yongji in the Northeast has proven that concentrating forces can seize the initiative. Therefore, secondary strongholds without military strategic value will still be abandoned when necessary in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Two Mornings, One Resolution <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper - (March 31st in Nanjing)</p>
<p>The convocation of the National Assembly is originally a test of public opinion, and democratic politics requires even longer efforts to learn lessons from past mistakes and move towards progress. Hu Shih was "drafted" again today to sit in the position of temporary chairman. When he was troubled by the voting machine dispute, he said: "I learned a lesson today. In the future, whoever is chairman must remember to test the voting machine before using it." This is progress. Looking at the meeting from this point of view, the one resolution barely obtained in two mornings is just one of many experiences.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 31st, the entire meeting hall was filled with shouts. Speakers were vying for the floor, and the order gradually became chaotic, making it difficult for Principal Hu to control. Originally, this second preparatory meeting was to invite Representative Yu Youren to serve as temporary chairman. Before the meeting, President Yu came and then left, and Yu Bin was nominated instead. However, the bishop could not be found in the meeting hall, so Hu Shih had to be pulled in again as a temporary chairman. Today's meeting continued yesterday's agenda to discuss the method of electing the presidium. Originally, the secretariat's summary of yesterday's opinions was already very complete, but today, more branches were born. In addition to someone shouting loudly for the signing representatives on hunger strike, even the voting machine—the most scientific tool—became the object of discussion and the target of suspicion. Hu Shih had indeed done his best, and he had shown it at least three times. The first time was when he announced a ten-minute break when the emotions of the audience were agitated, which eased the situation. The second time was to respect the result of the negative vote, even though the negative vote did not necessarily represent the majority, it also calmed everyone's emotions. The third time was after passing the motion to comfort the representatives on hunger strike, someone still wanted to speak. Chairman Hu cut the Gordian knot and announced "adjournment," and the representatives stood up one after another, and no one could speak anymore.</p>
<p>The smooth completion of the resolution should be attributed to one report and one proposal. Hong Lanyou was ordered to read the secretariat's summary of the results of the opinions of the representatives yesterday. The reasoning was clear, and all the main opinions were included. There were no new opinions from speakers after that. Wang Chonghui proposed that the National Assembly Organizational Law be sent to the National Government to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for amendment, while the election of the presidium should be carried out to quickly enter the agenda and save time, which became the basis for discussion. After the report and before the proposal, Chairman Hu Shih first voted on (1) maintaining the original method, (2) deciding to amend the election method, and (3) another suggestion that the presidium should still have 25 members, and a special committee should be established, with one representative from each unit participating and attending the presidium. However, the vote caused unexpected disputes.</p>
<p>Before and after the vote, many representatives strove to speak, but there were few new opinions, so there were shouts everywhere. Lin Bin took the stage to speak, and his opinion was quite valuable. He said: We should abide by the Constitution. Without solving the issue of the presidium, we cannot hold the National Assembly, and the decision of the preparatory meeting cannot amend any laws. We only need to elect the presidium and hold the National Assembly, and there will be plenty of opportunities to amend it later. But his words were too long, and he was shouted down in the agitated emotions. Female representative Zhang Sheng called for increasing the proportion of women in the presidium to 20 percent, which received sympathetic applause. At this time, the vote was finally taken. Hu Shih first voted on maintaining the original method. The light on the voting machine turned on, and a total of 933 people agreed. There were 1,862 representatives in the hall, a majority. Among those who advocated amendment, some expressed doubts about the voting machine, shouting "fake," which frightened the lady in charge of the voting machine from turning off the machine. Hu Shih announced that representatives could be sent to inspect it, but no one went. Hu Shih had to do a reverse vote, and as a result, 981 people agreed to the amendment. Adding the opinions of both sides together exceeded the number of representatives in the hall. Obviously, someone had flipped the voting machine twice. At this time, the meeting hall became even more chaotic. Hu Shih said: Someone must be curious, so they flipped it twice. In order to calm the meeting hall, he announced a ten-minute break.</p>
<p>When the meeting continued, the emotions were much calmer. Hu Shih announced that he respected the majority opinion of the reverse vote and passed the amendment. At the same time, he put forward the proposal of representatives such as Wang Chongzhuan. Several representatives continued to speak, advocating paying attention to the participation of representatives of border ethnic minorities in the presidium, and that the number of members in the presidium should not be rigidly stipulated, etc. At this time, a resolution was finally formulated after two mornings, sending the National Assembly Organizational Law to the National Government to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for rapid amendment, and attaching the opinions of the representatives of the two conferences as a reference for the amendment. Wang Chonghui also proposed to immediately proceed with the election of the presidium, but due to time constraints, he had to wait until tomorrow to say.</p>
<p>When the discussion came to comforting the signing representatives on hunger strike, although it was also noisy and there were constant boos, there were also some opinions, but Hu Shih's opinion was successfully passed. Hu Shih said, please authorize the chairman of this conference to appoint five to ten people from the proposed representatives to visit, comfort, and advise them to eat, pending a government solution. Ma Wen called out, comforting them at the same time as solving the problem. Someone booed him, so there was no follow-up. Hu Shih said, this is not something we can solve.</p>
<p>The second preparatory meeting was quickly adjourned. Hopefully tomorrow's "democracy lesson" will have even more progress.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Editorial: On Italy's April Elections <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Italian parliament is scheduled to hold re-elections on April 18th. With only a dozen days remaining, the competition between the left and right-wing parties within Italy has reached a fever pitch. Furthermore, the "Cold War" being waged by the two major international blocs has shifted its focus to the Italian peninsula. In recent days, the world's attention has been concentrated on Italy's April 18th election. When the Italian authorities decided on the date for the parliamentary re-election, the international community was already rife with alarming rumors. These rumors included claims that the Soviet Union was attempting to infiltrate the Italian peninsula with its communist forces, and that the Italian Communist Party was exceptionally active domestically and confident of winning the upcoming general election. This caused countries around the world to closely monitor the future development of the Italian political situation. The outcome of the Italian general election will not only determine Italy's fate but also influence the entire European situation. To prevent the intrusion of communist forces into the Italian peninsula, the United States, initially through a speech by Secretary of State Marshall, issued a serious verbal warning to the Italian Communist Party. It stated that if the Italian Communist Party controlled the Italian government, it would be clear evidence of Italy's withdrawal from the European Recovery Program, and the United States would no longer provide economic assistance. Subsequently, the United States, along with Britain and France, issued a joint statement proposing amendments to the Italian peace treaty, advocating for the return of the port of Trieste to Italy. The United States' diplomatic offensive, employing both hard and soft tactics towards Italy, has a clear purpose: to win over the hearts of the Italian people. This will likely have a significant impact, potentially even influencing the outcome of the April general election. However, on the other hand, it has also triggered serious repercussions.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Soviet Union will not remain "indifferent" to this diplomatic offensive by the United States. The Soviet representative's withdrawal from the Allied Control Council for Berlin is a powerful "counterattack" by the Soviet Union in the "Cold War." In the future, there will be endless intellectual and strategic battles on the diplomatic front. Secondly, Yugoslavia, due to its close relationship, had its Foreign Minister, Mr. Mikunovic, issue a strong protest to Britain, the United States, and France, immediately increasing the tension in the Trieste region. Yugoslavian army patrol teams briefly intruded into the Anglo-American defense zone of Trieste, resulting in clashes with local police. Although this was a small-scale incident, who can guarantee that it will not escalate? Britain and the United States have deployed large numbers of reinforcements to strengthen their defenses. Simultaneously, on the diplomatic front, Yugoslavia has demanded direct negotiations with Italy, seeking the Italian port of Gorizia as a condition for returning Trieste to Italy. However, the Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman has stated a firm rejection. Therefore, the Italian peninsula has, in fact, become a "battlefield" of the "Cold War," and it has reached a critical stage. The outcome of this general election is a decisive factor for the European situation and even for the peace of the entire world!</p>
<p>Since the Czech coup established a communist regime, Europe seems to have a clear dividing line, separating it into Eastern and Western Europe. The treaty of the Western European Union has also been signed and established in Paris. However, whether the Western European Union can achieve its intended goals and play its greatest role depends heavily on Italy's participation. Therefore, from the perspective of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, they must firmly pull Italy into expanding the scope of the Western European Union. Furthermore, the Italian peninsula is strategically located, extending into the Mediterranean Sea. From a military perspective, the United States will never allow communist forces to intrude into Italy. Moreover, after the Italian general election in April, France will also hold its general election in May. The outcome of the Italian general election will directly affect the French general election. Therefore, the United States does not want the Italian Communist Party to win the Italian general election. As for the Soviet Union, its focus on Italy is like its focus on Finland, with no difference. After consolidating its position within the Iron Curtain, the Soviet Union has long had the intention of continuing to move its Iron Curtain westward. However, in Southeastern Europe, it is still constrained by Turkey and Greece and cannot do as it pleases. If Italy is controlled by communist forces, not only will Greece and Turkey be subject to its dominance, further consolidating the Soviet Union's position in Southeastern Europe, but the Soviet Union's influence will also extend into the Mediterranean Sea. This would be enough to influence the French general election in May, and the so-called Western European Union would become meaningless. This is the main reason why Italy has become a battlefield of the Cold War.</p>
<p>However, looking at the situation within Italy, the intensity of party strife has reached a fever pitch. Italy is inherently a barren and impoverished island nation. Before the war, it relied on its overseas colonies to be self-sufficient in food and clothing. However, after the war, all its colonies were stripped away, and the sources of food and clothing were cut off. In addition, the Italian people suffered significant losses in the war. Therefore, the post-war Italy, whether in terms of national economy or people's livelihood, is on the verge of bankruptcy. No one can deny that this economic and social background only benefits the rise of the Communist Party. Taking last year's general election results as an example, the Christian Democratic Party received 7.87 million votes, while the Socialist Party and the Communist Party each received 4 million votes, and other parties combined received 4 million votes. In total, the right-wing and third-party votes only exceeded the left-wing votes by 1 million. However, over the past year, Italy's economic situation has deteriorated, and the Communist Party's influence has increased rather than decreased. There are no fewer than 99 political parties participating in this general election. What the future result will be remains an "unknown," but according to authoritative sources, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party may receive 35% to 40% of the votes, while the Christian Democratic Party may only receive 30% to 35%. From this, it can be seen that the future of the De Gasperi cabinet is hardly optimistic. The anxiety of the US government and public is excellent proof of this. Italy's wealthy are preparing to flee, which contrasts sharply with the election campaigns across the country. Prime Minister De Gasperi recently gave a campaign speech, asking the people to "cast a vote of confidence according to their conscience," appealing to the people with his religious fervor. Whether he can awaken the Italian people to appeal to their conscience and cast their sacred vote based on their common-sense judgment will only be revealed on April 18th.</p>
<h3 id="e21">He Yingqin Returns Home, Arrives in Shanghai, and Will Go to Nanjing This Morning to Attend the National Assembly. It is Said that Increased Foreign Aid Requires One's Own Efforts. <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] General He Yingqin, head of the Chinese military delegation to the United Nations Security Council, returned to Shanghai on a Pan American Clipper at 4:10 PM yesterday at Longhua Airport, due to a telegram from the chairman. Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Yu Dayue, Jiang Jingguo, Qian Dajun, Du Yuming and his wife, Jiang Dingwen, Liu Zhi, Fu Zhengmo, Shao Bochang, Zhuang Yuling, and others arrived around 3:00 PM to welcome him. Many of He's former subordinates came from Nanjing to greet him, with a total of over 200 people. There were also honor guards from the Garrison Command's youth military police's third battalion and public training student association lined up for inspection. The scale of the welcome broke all previous records at Longhua Airport. He, wearing a general's uniform, looked well-nourished and radiant. After receiving flowers from representatives of the Girl Scouts and Du Yuming's ten-year-old daughter, he stepped out of the airport to review the honor guard and shook hands with each of the welcoming representatives. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng also arrived before 4:00 PM, but due to his poor health, he did not enter the airport and waited in his car. He walked out of the airport, shook hands with Chen in front of his car, and then drove to his official residence to rest. In order to express their respect, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Department, various bureaus of the Municipal Government, and business representatives held a grand tea party at Yiyuan Hotel at 5:00 PM. He arrived at the meeting at 5:10 PM amidst warm applause. Chairman Fang Zhi delivered a speech, praising He's past achievements and welcoming General Jiang Fengwen, who had recently arrived in Shanghai. Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, then spoke, saying that the large number of people who went to the airport to welcome him today showed the people's high expectations for General He, and hoped that He would display his past spirit to quell the country's turmoil. Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council could not return to welcome him due to attending the National Assembly in Nanjing, and expressed his apologies. The chairman then invited He to speak. He first expressed his deep gratitude for the warm welcome from all walks of life, and then reported on his work abroad (see the written statement for details). He then discussed US military aid to China, believing that the US government and public have been concerned about this in recent months. The aid plan is expected to be decided by the US Congress in mid-April. Although the amount of aid is not large, it can show US concern. He believed that everything must be done by ourselves, so that foreign aid can be continuously increased. Regarding his impressions of the United States, he believed that the wealth of the United States is not only reflected in large cities, but also in rural areas. The production in American rural areas is almost completely mechanized and electrified. Ordinary farmhouses have radios, electric refrigerators, and all sanitary facilities. Their high standard of living cannot be compared with other countries. The reason for this is that the American people abide by the law, order is stable, construction is easy to achieve results, and they are also good at using modern science and technology. However, the rapid progress of the United States in all aspects has only occurred in the last 20 years. If China can restore peace, he believes that after 30 years of dedicated construction, it can also achieve such achievements. Finally, He praised Britain's arduous struggle today, saying that Britain's lack of materials today is even greater than China's, but the people have a tradition of democracy and law-abiding, all controls are thorough and fair, and the royal family and the common people share weal and woe, so although life is hard, the people have no complaints. This spirit is worthy of the Chinese people to learn from. After He finished his speech, there was thunderous applause. Jiang Dingwen was then invited to speak, also praising He's achievements, and saying that "the country has come to this point, and the Chief of Staff must return." The meeting ended at 6:00 PM. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing in the morning to attend the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>Elaborates on the Work of the Military Advisory Group</p>
<p>After the tea party, He immediately received reporters in the lounge of the Yiyuan Hotel and issued the following written statement:</p>
<p>"I was sent to the United States in July 1946 to attend the meetings of the United Nations Military Staff Committee. This time I returned to China to report to the central government, ask for instructions on various issues related to the work of the Military Staff Committee, and attend the National Assembly.</p>
<p>"The Military Staff Committee was established under Article 47 of the United Nations Charter, composed of military representatives from the five permanent members of the Security Council, namely China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. It is a military advisory body to the Security Council. It was established in London in February 1946 and moved to New York in March. After its establishment, the Military Staff Committee was instructed by the Security Council to study Article 43 of the Charter from a military perspective; in short, to study the organization of the United Nations army and related military issues. To carry out this research, the Military Staff Committee established five subcommittees (also composed of representatives from the five countries) to conduct discussions. Each issue was first discussed by the subcommittee, and then discussed by the Military Staff Committee. Among them, the most complicated were the 'General Principles for the Organization of the United Nations Army' and the 'Estimates of the Total Strength and Composition' of this army. The 'General Principles for the Organization of the United Nations Army' were completed at the end of April last year and submitted to the United Nations Security Council, where they are still being considered. The principles consist of 41 articles, of which 16 have not yet been unanimously agreed upon by the five countries in the Military Staff Committee. The difficulty of the process can be imagined. After submitting the general principles, the Military Staff Committee continued to discuss the estimates of total strength and composition. The so-called estimate is to study how much force the United Nations army needs and how it should be composed, which is an extremely difficult issue. After eight months, the subcommittee completed the discussion of the estimates of the total strength of the army, navy, and air force, but the opinions of the five countries were still mostly not consistent. This estimate is currently under discussion in the Military Staff Committee. This kind of international armed force organization is unprecedented in history, and international relations are complex and involve many factors. Therefore, it has taken two years and nearly two hundred meetings to achieve the above results, but the representatives of all countries have indeed made great efforts. The detailed situation of the work of the Military Staff Committee has rarely been reported to the country in public in the past because Article 13 of the internal rules of procedure stipulates that it should not be released to the outside world alone. Those that have been approved for publication by the Military Staff Committee, such as the full text of the general principles and the total force estimates submitted by each delegation, have been reported in the newspapers one after another, and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>"The United Nations army is a practical force for the Security Council to maintain or restore international peace and security, so people all over the world hope that it will be formed as soon as possible. My country's sincere support for the United Nations has been clearly stated in the Constitution. My government is very willing to do its best to assist the work of the Military Staff Committee, and I personally hope to continue to work hard to see it succeed."</p>
<p>Answering Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>No Intention to Run for Vice President</p>
<p>Reporters then raised questions one after another, which He answered one by one. The main points are as follows: (1) It is rumored that General He will run for vice president after returning to China. Is this true? Answer: Serving the country is not about position. I have no intention of running for election. (2) What is Feng Yuxiang doing in the United States? What are your thoughts on his activities? Answer: I met Mr. Feng once when he first arrived in the United States. He inspected the T.V.A. for five or six days. After Feng took an anti-government stance, I did not meet him again. The United States is a democratic country, and all kinds of opinions can be freely expressed. Americans do not value Feng's activities. I believe that the country is in distress, and all people, except the Communist Party, should work together. (3) Does General He believe that the Soviet Union's ambitions will cause a third world war? Answer: There are many Soviet friends in the United Nations Staff Committee. This question is inconvenient to answer. Please forgive me. (4) Americans have always been critical of the Chinese government. What are General He's views on this? Answer: Americans still believe that the reforms of our government are not enough, but they have not specifically stated how to reform. I have not asked Marshall about this. (5) What is the American attitude towards Marshall's policy? Answer: Most people support Marshall's policy of aiding Europe and China.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Wang Yunwu and Three Others Reply to He Yingqin Regarding the Special Donation for Relief <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Wang Yunwu and others from the Supervisory Committee of the Special Relief Donation of the Executive Yuan previously received a letter from He Yingqin, solemnly denying that he was one of the richest men in the country, which was reported in domestic newspapers, and that he would be the main target of the special relief donation. He only wished to take the lead in donating according to the regulations based on the actual value of his property, in order to promote it. The committee stated that it had always been advocated that government officials should take the lead in the special relief donation, but no decision had been made so far, and the rumors were quite different from the truth. The reply from Wang et al. is recorded as follows: Brother Yingqin of the Military Order, upon receiving your gracious message, I learned everything. I checked the list of the richest people in the country, which this country has not released. The rumors in the newspapers are not credible. However, the special relief donation is an initiative. At a time when bandits are rampant and victims are everywhere, and the country's finances are extremely difficult, general opinion hopes that government officials will take the lead in donating to show their advocacy. My brother feels deeply concerned and has a public spirit. If you can raise your voice and donate generously for the sake of the country, I would be grateful. I will await your reply, and I wish you good health. Wang Yunwu, Gu Zhenggang, Yu Hongjun, and Jiang Yong jointly started.</p>

After leasing, the Philippine side guarantees that Chinese merchants can continue to operate, and will not make things difficult when renewing their licenses every year.

It is now known that as of March 27, more than 2,000 overseas Chinese merchants have applied to lease vacant stalls in the vegetable markets to resume their old businesses.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 30th] The Canadian Senate Immigration Committee recently expressed its support for all overseas Chinese living in Canada, regardless of whether they are Canadian citizens, to be allowed to bring their wives and children to live in Canada.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 31st] Food prices in Sichuan province have soared. The price of rice in Chengdu on the 31st was 5.12 million for a double stone. The increase was caused by rumors of a reorganization of the provincial government, which caused unrest.

The provincial government will send people to thoroughly investigate and strictly suppress prices.</p>

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 31st] The Jishi Mountain exploration plane was preparing to depart at 8:55 this morning at Nanyuan Airport when it crashed less than half a minute later, fortunately without injuring anyone. The four-engine behemoth slowly moved out of the parking area. When it was moving to the runway, the right wheel sunk into the mud, and the wheel pin broke. The fuselage then tilted to the right, causing the rightmost propeller to also sink into the mud. The nose wheel broke, and the belly of the fuselage touched the ground and could not move. Although the damage was not great, even if there were parts to match, it would take several weeks to repair. After inspecting the damage to the fuselage, Reno told reporters: "The exploration is over. Everest is still the highest peak in the world." The pilot, Oden, smiled and said: I don't believe the plane was sabotaged. This unfortunate incident was all caused by the loose soil between the parking area and the runway, which could not support it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lanzhou, 31st] Scientists from the Jishi Mountain exploration team have expressed impatience because the large team from their country has not yet arrived. American scientists Goswell and Ross and three Chinese scientists arrived here as early as last Thursday. Goswell and Professor McKay must return to the United States within days. Provincial government officials here have also expressed disappointment after waiting empty-handed at the airport for a long time.</p>

<p>[Our Jiading Dispatch, 30th] A murder case occurred in the home of Qin Genyuan in Meituan, Northwest Corner, on the evening of the 28th. According to this reporter's investigation: Qin Genyuan was a tax collector during the enemy and puppet regime. Because he extorted donations and oppressed the villagers, he was killed before the victory. His wife, Zhu, nicknamed A Xiao, is now 34 years old. After Qin's death, she met Zhang Shanlin, who worked at the Fuda Flower Shop in Ximen, and with the consent of his aunt, Tang, they began living together. Shanlin tried his best to maintain the Qin family's livelihood. Later, Shanlin partnered with someone to open a rice mill, but the business failed, and he owed Tang 30 dans of wheat. He was unable to repay it for a while, which caused constant quarrels within the family. Recently, the relationship between Zhu and Shanlin deteriorated further, and Shanlin suspected Zhu of improper behavior, leading him to consider killing her out of jealousy. At about 7 p.m. on the 28th, Shanlin lured Zhu away from her home. When they reached a small bamboo bridge dozens of steps away, Shanlin, seeing that no one was around, pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed Zhu directly in the throat, hitting the lower jaw. Zhu immediately fainted to the ground, and Shanlin fled without a trace. The police have issued strict orders to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice. Zhu's injuries were discovered, and doctors were immediately called for treatment. Due to excessive bleeding, she is still in critical condition.</p>

<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch, 31st] Lu Zhiren, the boss of Zhiren Tinfoil Shop on Nanda Street in our county, has recently been sued by his abandoned wife, Yuan Jinjin, for forcibly seizing someone else's wife and colluding with the enemy and puppet authorities to kill her former husband, Gu Wencan. She is demanding that Lu be arrested and severely punished. Lu Zhiren is fond of women and originally had an affair with Yuan Jinjin, but after a long time, he became tired of her and made a new love. Yuan was very angry at being abandoned and sued him to the court for abandonment and inflicted violent injuries on her, which were verified as scars. Lu was once imprisoned, but he used his wealth and was released soon after. Yuan disregarded everything and revealed all the past secrets. Originally, Yuan Jinjin was married to Gu Wencan, and she was only eighteen years old at the time. Lu lured her in many ways, and she fell into his trap. First, they rented a house to live together, and then he tricked her into taking everything she owned and running away with Lu, who then became rich overnight. Lu initially used the power of the enemy and puppet forces to lure Gu Wencan into the city, forcing him to sign an unconditional divorce, and Lu and Yuan openly lived together. Later, when he heard that Gu had joined the underground work, Lu feared retaliation and conspired with Commander Teng, an enemy and puppet official with whom he had close ties, to lure Gu into prison, where he was tortured and beaten to death. The father of the deceased, Gu Huansheng, also committed suicide by hanging himself because of this. This happened in 1942. The process was very cruel and poisonous. Yuan Jinjin only revealed it today, and those who spoke said that the wheels of heaven turn slowly but surely, and Lu Zhiren will not escape the law.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Revised Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Private Cars: Stipulating the Limited Amount of Gasoline Required <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] After the promulgation of the regulations on restricting the use of private cars, some difficulties arose during implementation. Because the principles were too strict, various parties put forward many suggestions for improvement. The US Embassy also submitted a memorandum stating that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Utilities Bureau had successively announced the standards for the registration and transfer of public and private cars and stopped processing the registration and licensing of private cars, which would cause various difficulties for car importers and individuals who purchased cars and resold them. It is hoped that the relevant Chinese government agencies will reconsider the regulations on the use of private cars in the austerity implementation plan and that restrictions should be imposed on gasoline allocation methods, vehicles, taxes, and license plates in order to be fair. The Shanghai Municipal Government also submitted a proposed "Method for Using and Conserving Gasoline to Control the Use of Cars." The reason is that it has been clearly ordered to stop individuals from bringing cars into the country from abroad, and car dealers have also set a limit on the number of cars imported each month. If strict restrictions are placed on the users of these imported cars, the vehicles will be left idle, the parts will be damaged, and they will become waste. If the permitted cars are limited to individuals or private legal entities that meet the regulations, then there will be cases of impersonation in future car sales and registration. Furthermore, British and American merchants have repeatedly expressed objections to our country's restrictions on cars. Therefore, it is considered necessary to change the regulations. It is now known that the Executive Yuan's Austerity Supervision Committee has re-examined the original plan, revised it to restrict the use of private cars, and stipulated restrictions on the gasoline required, such as limiting small cars to 60 gallons per month and large cars to 100 gallons per month.</p>

<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 31st] The tragic death of Deng Meikui in Yiyang has been highly valued by all sectors of the provincial party and government. Li Zhonghuai, the secretary-general of the Yixian County Party Headquarters, has been dismissed by the provincial party headquarters. Tian Zhi, the county magistrate, came to Changsha from Yiyang on the 30th to attend the National Assembly in Nanjing and expressed remorse for the Deng case. (According to County Magistrate Tian's initial statement, Deng was a member of a secret society and his killing had nothing to do with the rent reduction movement.) In addition to raising one dan of grain to compensate Deng's bereaved family, he has also resigned out of guilt.</p>
<h3 id="e45">The Unfinished Granary <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei wrote on the memorial stele of the reopened Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: "Hunan and Jiangxi produce rice, and Zhejiang produces salt. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is essential for trade and commerce and is of great importance to the livelihoods of ordinary people." We traveled along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Hangzhou and saw mountains of varying distances in Xiaoshan, Jinhua, Quzhou, and Jiangshan. As soon as we entered the Jiangxi border, we slowly discovered large expanses of plains, but barren land outnumbered cultivated land. Some of the land had clearly not been fertilized for many years, and the bottom layer of the land was exposed outside, the red color, with withered grass that had not yet recovered lying on the red soil. Because of these plains, we can understand that Jiangxi must have been quite prosperous many years ago. Jiangxi Province has 173,513 square kilometers, with 1,500 mu per square kilometer, which means there are 260,026,950 mu. According to surveys, there are 38,486,513 mu of cultivated land. Obviously, this is a congenital prototype granary, and with the united efforts of the common people, a fruitful harvest can be expected.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Granary is Nominal</p>
<p>Looking at Jiangxi Province with an objective eye, we feel that Jiangxi Province is indeed a rice-producing area, but unfortunately it has not been developed. The reason why it has not been developed is of course because of the small population. With a small population, it is impossible to produce a particularly large amount of grain. However, now all places believe that Jiangxi is a granary. Hunan rice is used to supply Guangdong and Guangxi, and Jiangxi rice certainly has a surplus. Therefore, even recently Shanghai wants to give up buying锡米 and buy赣米, then the people of Jiangxi will be in a panic again.</p>
<p>The Four Famous Towns are Closely Related</p>
<p>In this nominal granary, there are also four famous towns, namely Zhangshu, which is a distribution center for medicinal materials, and is commonly known as "medicine is not complete without Zhangshu." This town is also one of the outlets for rice. The second is Jingde, which is the place of origin for porcelain. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, it produced 500,000 dans. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, it produced more than 470,000 dans. Now it only produces 300,000 dans, which is not very prosperous. The third is Hekou, which is the distribution center for 100,500 dans of Jiangxi paper. Now, due to cost and sales problems, production has decreased, and the market has also declined. One is Wucheng, which is the distribution center for timber. It is said that Jiangxi produces more than 17 million trees a year, most of which are transported by water from here. It has not been prosperous after the war. The value of the Zhezhan-Jiangxi Railway will be reduced. These four famous towns are actually closely related to the granary, because the prosperity of the countryside will make these four famous towns more prosperous, and the large population will attempt to manage other special industries. Today, the most important thing in Jiangxi Province is to fully reclaim the wasteland in Jiangxi and promote prosperity, so that all waste can be carried out. Before reclamation, we should still have the prerequisites for disturbing the good farmland and water conservancy.</p>
<p>The Plan is Perfect, but Funding is Difficult to Raise</p>
<p>Now Jiangxi Province has a relatively long-term plan for farmland water conservancy, such as the "K.V.A." plan, which is to manage the water of the Gan River in order to store it during floods for power generation or irrigation of farmland. This is certainly a good plan, but it is easier said than done. Although all the surveys have now been completed, there is really no way to get the funding to start the renovation. According to Hong Gui, Director of the Gan Finance Department, 50% or more of Jiangxi's finances rely on central government allocations. However, if the central government borrows more than 10 million dans of grain from Jiangxi, and if 5 million ancestors can be repaid in the future, the "K.V.A." plan can also be carried out.</p>
<p>100,000 Reservoirs Store Water to Prevent Drought</p>
<p>Secondly, Jiangxi Province has 100,000 reservoirs to store water to prevent drought, and when there is too much water, the excess water can also be injected into the reservoirs. This is certainly a good plan. Hu Jiazhao, Director of the Jiangxi Construction Department, told reporters: We are now slowly starting to do it, and of course there will not be a very large effect in a short time. Again, it is to renovate Poyang Lake. The area around Poyang Lake is fertile land. If it can be renovated well, it can greatly increase production. Jiangxi Province is also starting to do it. These agricultural water conservancy plans are difficult to see the effect in a short time.</p>
<p>Repairing Ditches and Ridges Facilitates Cultivation</p>
<p>Before the plan is realized, we had better simply repair the fields, ridges, and ditches for them, so that the relocated people or the returned people can easily cultivate. If we go one step further and build or specially contract a model village, thoroughly improve the life of the countryside, so that farmers can rest and have fun, so that farmers can have their mountains, and truly realize the Principle of People's Livelihood, then people who suppress the city and are troubled will also return to the countryside because of this, then the countryside of Jiangxi should be the most ideal.</p>
<p>It is easy to build a desolate and ruined place, but we hope to build the foundation firmly and thoroughly, and quickly complete and enrich this granary in Central China! (March 28. Nanchang)</p>

<h3 id="e46">United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission Declares Indefinite Recess: The United States Increases Funding to Study Atomic Secrets <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] New York, 31st Broadcast: Washington News, Members of Congress today stated that the United States has a sufficient number of atomic bombs and is still constantly manufacturing them. They said that this news came from Mr. Lilienthal, Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission. Lilienthal made a secret testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on February 28 this year.</p>
<p>[Success Lake, Reuters, 30th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission, which was ordered to draft an international atomic energy control agreement, collapsed completely today. The commissioners successively stated that it was meaningless to continue the discussion due to the stubborn position of the Soviet Union. With the support of the United States in England, Belgium, France and Canada, a motion was made to dissolve the Atomic Energy Control Commission. Professor史戈培尔钦, the Soviet representative and chairman of the committee, with the support of Ukraine, tried to keep the discussion going. He said that the Soviet Union's previous view that any international atomic energy control agency should not interfere with the sovereignty of the country, he said that the discussion was deadlocked, not because of a small number of members, but because the majority of members firmly supported the views of the United States. He also believed that the Soviet Union's proposal was a concrete opinion and could be used as a practical basis for atomic energy control. Finally, the chairman announced an indefinite recess of the Atomic Energy Control Commission. The Working Committee (Technical Committee) of another atomic energy organization, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, will also be declared dead on Monday, and then the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission will report the failure of its mission to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Washington, United Press Agency, 30th] The US House Appropriations Committee passed an additional $150 million for atomic research on the 30th and urged federal officials to step up the research program. It is said that the committee will advise the Atomic Energy Commission to conduct a full study of the peacetime and wartime uses of newly discovered atomic energy secrets. After this proposal is put forward, it will bring this year's atomic research funding to US$659,090,000.</p>

<p>[This newspaper reports] New York, 31st Broadcast: Washington News, the Senate and the House of Representatives will be able to reach a compromise on the US$6.25 billion foreign aid bill and send it to the President in the middle of this week. However, the Senate expressed opposition to including Spain in the European reconstruction plan. In Europe, England, France, and Italy were shocked and indignant at the decision of the US House of Representatives to allow Spain to join the European reconstruction plan, especially Italy, which believes that this move will strengthen the position of the Communist Party in the elections on April 18 and reduce the meaning of the British, American, and French proposals to return the special port to Italy. Madrid officials expressed "gratification." Moscow has not yet commented, but all parties believe that this action by the US House of Representatives will help the Soviet Union carry out a diplomatic "cold war."</p>
<p>[Paris, French News Agency, 30th] The Spanish Republican side here was furious when it heard of the resolution of the US House of Representatives and said that if it decides to sacrifice Spanish democracy, it will be impossible to solve the Spanish problem by peaceful means.</p>
<p>The Western imperialists also expressed disappointment at this decision by the US House of Representatives, saying that the tension of the international situation led to it.</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 30th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office recently stated that the decision of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee to allow Spain to participate in the Marshall Aid Program to Europe will not affect Britain's attitude towards Spain. Observers here also believe that the United States' decision allows Spain to obtain economic assistance on the same conditions as the other sixteen countries. Although it cannot be prevented, if such assistance is placed under the management of the歇尔 Plan, it will inevitably require the consent of the sixteen European countries for Spain to join the European Economic Cooperation Committee. This resolution must be established by the European Economic Cooperation Committee at its next plenary meeting, which will be held in mid-April, when the chief representatives of the sixteen countries will meet to review the recommendations of the working committee on the establishment of a permanent institution for the purpose of managing US aid and coordinating self-help cooperation measures among the sixteen countries. At that time, if it is proposed to allow Spain to participate, Britain will still oppose Spain under the rule of the Franco regime based on its established policy.</p>

<h3 id="e50">"Times and Crisis": Stimson's Memoir Published <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[New York, Reuters, 30th] Women's Home Magazine recently published the memoir of former Army Chief Stimson, entitled "Times and Crisis." Stimson revealed that he had suggested to President Truman at the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 to use the secret of the atomic bomb as a tool to democratize the Soviet secret police state. Stimson believed that if the world organization contained a police state, the new organization would not be able to effectively control it. A few months later, Stimson also admitted that the suggestion was unusable. Stimson said that Stalin at Potsdam expressed a strong interest in obtaining bases in the Mediterranean and other areas outside the Soviet sphere of influence. When the United States began to prepare for the offensive in the Pacific, the Red Army expanded its power in Europe day by day, believing that support for the Soviet Union's excessive demands. At that time, Stimson knew that there could be no permanent and secure international relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. In September 1945, he wrote to Roosevelt, expressing that he knew that the secret of the atomic bomb could not be used to change the Soviet Union's attitude. He also submitted a memorandum to Roosevelt, pointing out that if the United States continued to negotiate with the Soviet Union while holding the secret of the atomic bomb, it would be enough to increase the Soviet Union's suspicion of the United States. Therefore, he suggested that the United States, with the support of the United Kingdom, should directly contact the Soviet Union to establish an agreement on the control of the atomic bomb. As a result, his suggestion was not adopted. In 1947, although he knew that the hope of directly contacting the Soviet Union for atomic energy control was less than in 1945, he still thought it was worth a try. By the time of his eightieth birthday in September of that year, he had confirmed that it was impossible to stand side by side with the current communism for the same goal. Stimson did not think that the Soviet Union would launch a war. He urged Americans who were willing to make peace with the Soviet Union to fully participate in the work of Western European reconstruction, quickly establish world peace rather than American peace, and at the same time engage in the establishment of freedom and prosperity within the United States.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] Today, the United States submitted two resolutions to the Security Council requesting an immediate armistice in Palestine and the convening of a special session of the UN General Assembly. The former states, "The Security Council, recognizing that the maintenance of international peace and security is its primary responsibility, is deeply concerned about the increasing violence and disorder in Palestine. It believes that an immediate armistice in Palestine is a matter of urgency. The Security Council specifically requests the Jewish Agency and the Arab Higher Committee to nominate representatives to the Security Council to negotiate an armistice between the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine." The latter resolution states, "The Security Council, having received the resolution passed by the General Assembly on November 29, 1947, regarding Palestine on December 9, 1947, and subsequently having received the first and second monthly reports of the United Nations Palestine Commission and its hundredth special report on security issues, and having instructed the permanent members of the Security Council on March 5, 1948, to engage in discussions, hereby requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 20 of the Charter, to convene a special plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly to consider the future government of Palestine."

<p>Insists on Partition, Opposes Trusteeship</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke next, opposing the US proposal to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue. It is claimed that the US wants to overturn the Palestine partition plan in order to save its oil rights and military interests in the Middle East. There is no reason to convene a special session of the General Assembly. The US proposal for a UN trusteeship is merely an excuse to maintain order and turn Palestine into an American and British military base. The United States should bear full responsibility for the cancellation of the Palestine partition plan. Gromyko's attitude foreshadows his use of the veto in the Security Council, at which point the US will have to consult with member states individually. If it obtains the statutory majority of twenty-nine votes, it can convene a special session of the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 31st] The Committee on Transmission of News of the International Conference on Freedom of Information has passed the suggestion proposed by the United States. The suggestion stipulates that the government must encourage the most possible freedom of movement for foreign reporters and must not implement discriminatory restrictions on their entry into a country, residence or travel. The committee also passed two resolutions from France in order to ensure: (1) the broadest possible access to sources of information, both public and private, without discrimination; (2) the elimination of unreasonable or discriminatory taxes levied on foreign news agencies or reporters. The Soviet Union and its supporters opposed both resolutions.</p>

<p>Copyright by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance Translated by Our Editorial Office</p>
<p>(5) Stilwell, the Implementer of the Policy</p>
<p>General Stilwell, the main implementer of the wartime US policy toward China, used American lend-lease supplies as a means of control throughout his three years of dealing with the Chinese central government.</p>
<p>He used lend-lease as a magic weapon, attempting to eventually rule China - but failed as a result.</p>
<p>Stilwell lacked friendly respect and candor in handling Sino-American cooperative relations. He was almost always uncoordinated with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, seemingly not regarding him and other Chinese leaders as colleagues, but treating them as obstacles to be overcome. Threats were his most proficient method of persuasion.</p>
<p>Stilwell and his staff either used pressure to demand expanded powers in China, or when Washington did not allow him to do so, they criticized Washington for being "weak and incompetent." Official records show that he repeatedly requested Washington to grant him the power to use the cessation of supplies as a means to deal with Chongqing. This action was well known in China.</p>
<p>Based on what I know about the circumstances of his recall in 1944, I believe that his final threat was that unless he could freely control China's combat power, all aid to China would be stopped, or even worse. Whether President Roosevelt supported this claim is unknown.</p>
<p>Although, for various reasons, this historic "ultimatum" has been kept secret by both the Chinese and American governments, I have no doubt about its possible impact - that is, replacing Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek with General Stilwell.</p>
<p>Throughout Stilwell's tenure as commander of the China-Burma-India Theater and chief of staff to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, this was the goal that determined his actions. Therefore, from the time Stilwell walked out of Burma in 1942 and suggested placing the Chinese army under the administration of American officers, until the dramatic showdown in 1944 when he was forced to be recalled from Chongqing, this goal controlled US relations with China.</p>
<p>Up to that time, Stilwell's actions did not qualify him for this huge task, and the military defeats in China that led him to make this major demand were due as much to his own shortcomings and short-sightedness as to those of the central government, or even more so. Later, I will analyze the causes and effects of this.</p>
<p>But aside from all other considerations, if Stilwell's final request to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had been granted, I believe that this would have led to the darkest failure of US policy toward China. The result could only have been the disintegration of a country whose friendship and strength, no matter how often we misjudge, has always been and still is our greatest asset in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>I know the emotions and personality of the Chinese people deeply, and I am certain that neither Stilwell nor any foreigner can rule them unless through force and with the help of Chinese puppets. However, as Stilwell's successor, General Wedemeyer, soon made clear, there is another reasonable and effective way to get along with the Chinese government, which Stilwell never tried.</p>
<p>In recent months, the United States has again insisted on "reform" as a prerequisite for helping China resist communism, which makes me wonder if Washington has reverted to the spirit of Stilwell's undesirable method. Are we able to once again demand practical concessions from the central government as the price for our aid to China?</p>
<p>Obviously, long after Stilwell was recalled, even after his death, his misjudgment of the central government still had a subtle and prejudicial influence on our country's post-war policy toward China. This is not unnatural, because Stilwell's view of China had been influencing Washington's attitude for a long time.</p>
<p>I feel that the real reason for the failure of Stilwell's mission has never been officially acknowledged by Washington: that is, a person was sent to perform a task that exceeded his ability and was incompatible with his personality, as I would like to point out in these memoirs.</p>
<p>For fear that people might think I am discriminating against someone who is no longer able to defend himself, I should explain that I had placed this criticism before him long before Stilwell's death. As far as I know, this did not elicit a response from him.</p>
<p>Even so, I would not be willing to do so if I could not be sure that my public account of what happened could clarify the sound purpose of one of the most misunderstood chapters in the history of World War II, and this chapter is now very important for properly understanding our country's relationship with China.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Two Types of Rice Rationed This Month: Allocation Increased, Price Determined; Sales Begin Today and End on the 25th <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of rice rations in the city for April has been decided by the three-person committee. The rice price is divided into two types: high-quality US rice costs 310,000 yuan per person, and lower-quality domestic rice costs 250,000 yuan per person. Each person can get 15 catties and 10 taels of rice, which is 10 taels more than the 1 dou (approximately 12.5 catties) per person in March.</p>
<p>The three-person committee held a meeting at 5 pm yesterday in the mayor's office at the city government. In addition to Mayor Wu, representatives from the Food Department, Ye Shifu, and the Administrative Yuan's US Aid China Relief Material Handling Committee, Pan Guanghui, the chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, Ren Xianqun, attended. According to Ren's report after the meeting: the April rice ration is divided into two types, US rice and domestic rice. The US rice comes from twelve different regions in the United States and can be divided into three types based on its color: (1) Deep yellow: Its characteristic is that it does not spoil after long storage. Even after being cooked, it will not deteriorate within a week. Moreover, this kind of rice is particularly rich in nutrients because it was steamed under high pressure before milling, so all the nutrients in the husk are penetrated into the rice. It is said that it only needs to be poured with boiling water to turn raw rice into cooked rice, so it is very precious in India and the price is very high. (2) White: The quality of the rice is equivalent to China's second-grade second-quality japonica rice, which is very expansive. (3) Light yellow: The rice is sticky and expansive. In addition to the above three types of US rice, there is also good quality Siamese rice and Burmese rice purchased by the government. The material is excellent and it is decided to be included in the US rice category. Its price is the same as US rice, set at 310,000 yuan for 15 catties and 10 taels per person.</p>
<p>Regarding domestic rice, in addition to the remaining 10 or more dan (approximately 1000-1200 catties) of rice from the March ration, there are also more than 10,000 tons of rice that the United Nations planned to transport to the Communist areas in North China last year. Later, due to traffic obstructions, it could not be shipped, and the government bought it. It has been a long time, the quality is poor, and various types of rice are mixed together. When the authorities distribute it this month, they will still maintain the original price of 240,000 yuan per dou in March. The reason why it is now set at 250,000 yuan per person is because the quantity has increased by 10 taels compared to March. The deadline for the April rice ration is set from today (the 1st) to the 25th.</p>
<p>Two Types of Cooking Oil Prices</p>
<p>In addition, the rationing of cooking oil per person has been set to be implemented this month. Each person will be rationed 12 taels of oil per month, which can be freely bought and sold according to the rice rationing rules. The price of cooking oil is: vegetable oil, soybean oil, and sesame oil cost 50,000 yuan per person; raw oil costs 55,000 yuan per person. It will start from the 11th of this month and end on the 25th.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Liangxin" ship of the Zhongyuan Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Keelung the day before yesterday, carrying 4,600 tons of coal for the Fuel Commission. At about 3 pm, it docked at the Kaiyuan Coal Wharf in Pudong. At that time, several wooden barges were docked at nearby piers, including two that had been loaded with about 100 tons of coal, which was fuel for the Pudong Electric Company. When the "Liangxin" ship was docking, it was during the high tide and the current was rapid. It dropped anchor to assist docking, but when it raised the anchor, the engine malfunctioned and the ship retreated, damaging the two coal barges. The two coal barges immediately sank. The employees of the wooden barges all escaped to the pier, and fortunately no one was injured. The coal carried by the "Liangxin" ship was originally scheduled to be unloaded in the city. After arriving in Shanghai, it was ordered by the Fuel Commission to be transported to another port for unloading, so it was exported at about 2 pm yesterday.

<p>Chen Lingya, the representative of the Xuzhou Eight Counties and Cities Relief Association, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. According to what he told reporters: "Last year, Xuzhou suffered hail disasters in the wheat crop and flooding in the autumn, resulting in reduced food production. In addition, Communist bandits disturbed the area, looting everywhere, causing the countryside to be devastated and impoverished. Moreover, in the thirty or forty counties in southern Shandong and eastern Henan, the Communist bandits conducted liquidations, and good farmers fled to Xuzhou. Displaced people died at a rate of thirty or forty people per day, and groups of people come south to Beijing and Shanghai, reaching several thousands per day. Therefore, the speakers of the Xuzhou Eight Counties and Cities councils went to Beijing to appeal to the relevant authorities. Foreigners in Xuzhou also elected representatives Peng Yongen and Rong Shiqian, along with myself, to come to Shanghai to request assistance from the US Government's China Relief Group. They have obtained the sympathy of the group and instructed Peng and others to draft an urgent relief plan and submit it to the association for discussion, hoping that part of the funds from the food and sales items in the five major cities can be allocated to handle relief in Xuzhou. In addition, the Ministry of Social Affairs has also promised to allocate funds for relief, intending to use work as relief and assist local construction."</p>

<h3 id="e88">Gasoline Sources Are Scarce and Supply Reduced; Gasoline and Diesel Allocation Committee Implements Monthly Reduction of Quotas <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is learned that the prices of gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, etc. in this city have been rising recently due to export restrictions in the United States and a one-fifth increase in transportation costs compared to the past. Fortunately, 80% of the various liquid fuels imported by our country come from the Near East, and most of the gasoline used for aircraft and automobiles comes from the United States. It is said that although the United States restricts the export of oil, it will still provide a certain amount for essential consumption. In today's situation where oil sources are becoming increasingly scarce, it is said that the authorities are considering reducing the supply of gasoline to various vehicles and industries in this city. As far as the allocation of various oil materials by the Transport Control Committee's Gasoline and Diesel Allocation Committee is concerned, it is also being reduced month by month in order to conserve. The quota for January of this year was allocated at 80% of the original approved quota for each household, the quotas for February and March were allocated at 75%, and the quota for April has been decided to be allocated at 70%.</p>

<h3 id="e90">The Mystery of the Madman: Yan Peixing and His Wife Each Hold Their Own Views; Confusing and Unpredictable Family Dispute <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The crux of the matter lies in the huge fortune</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Peixing, a native of Wuxi, accused his wife of coveting his property, forcibly declaring him insane, and sending him to the Puji Sanatorium for confinement. Since the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association exposed the matter and hired lawyers such as Zhou Xiaoan to publish statements in the newspaper, his wife, Yan Yuan Baoying, also hired lawyers such as Xian Wenguang to publish rebuttal notices yesterday, and hosted reporters at 3:00 PM, presenting various documents. On the other hand, the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association also hosted reporters again last night. Both sides held their own views, and the inside story was extremely confusing.</p>
<p>Whether Yan Peixing has a mental illness is one of the focuses of this case. Yan Peixing himself, the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association, and his relatives on his side said that he absolutely does not. Yuan Baoying, however, said that he definitely has a mental illness. Yuan presented many documents and photos at yesterday's reception. These documents were all written by Yan Peixing under the name "Yan Ti," with absurd and nonsensical language. For example, "Starting from January 1 of the year of each country in the world, implement the first year of the Lord, the government of the Lord, the imperial system, the supreme leader is the Emperor, the Heavenly King Yan Ti, the Heavenly Kingdom Emperor Chiang Kai-shek, the American Emperor Truman, the British Emperor George V, the Soviet Emperor Stalin, the four great powers, June 1." "Heaven wants to marry two outstanding Chinese women who can understand the languages of various countries, wants to marry two outstanding American women, wants to marry one outstanding British woman, wants to marry one outstanding Soviet woman, all of whom can understand the international world situation; the above six , hold a wedding ceremony at the same time, introduced and witnessed by the great presidents of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, April 20." "All civil and military ministers of all countries in the world, every month on the first and fifteenth day of the Heavenly Calendar, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, shall all go to court to the Emperor to strike the golden bell as a signal, to report matters if there are any, and to retire after lunch if there are none, July 29." "All Kuomintang, Revolutionary Party, Communist Bandit Party, Socialist Party, Labor Party, Youth Party, Youth League, Youth Association, Blue Shirt Party, Green Shirt Party, Old Man's Refugee Party, Cheaters, Trade Unions, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and other groups and parties, etc., are all abolished, and only obedience to Catholicism is permitted, June 1"... and so on. Similar kinds of ridiculous texts.</p>
<p>A bizarre photograph in addition to absurd text</p>
<p>It is said that there are about one or two hundred of them. In addition to the text, there are also two photos, in which Yan Peixing is sitting with his hair disheveled, with a memorial table in front of him, with a pair of candles on the table. Yuan Baoying is kneeling in front of the table (see photo). It is said that this is a photo of Yan Peixing claiming to be the Emperor of Heaven and demanding that his wife obey him. There is also a large painting by Fang Long of a dragon and a sun, with the words "The True Lord of the Heavenly Dragon." Regarding these absurd texts, photos, and paintings, Yan Peixing himself explained it this way yesterday: part of the text was written by him casually for fun, and part of it was taught to him by Yuan Baoying. As for the photos, it's a long story. At the end of the thirty-fifth year, he was angry with his wife and returned to his hometown of Wuxi. He prepared to bring weapons, but later, after persuasion from his family, his wife came to Wuxi to kneel and beg him to repent. This photo was taken at that time because his wife said she wanted to leave a memento, but unexpectedly it was "a premeditated conspiracy" to use it as evidence of his mental illness; as for that , he was preparing to use it as a trademark for his factory's products.</p>
<p>Slightly Dull Expression, Speech Still Normal</p>
<p>So, does Yan Peixing have a mental illness? From his appearance, apart from a slightly dull expression, there are no unusual signs. At yesterday evening's reception, he reported on his experience in front of the microphone (see photo). Although his speech was slow and not very clear, it could still be considered normal. After leaving the Puji Sanatorium, he went to Renji Hospital for an examination, which, it is said, "showed no mental abnormalities." He also stayed at Yihe Hospital for a few days, where Dr. Huang Zhongqiang issued a certificate stating that he "suffered from cardiac enlargement and high blood pressure." That being said, why did the Puji Sanatorium accept him as a mental patient? To this end, the reporter specially visited Huang Yingbang, the director doctor of the Puji Sanatorium who was responsible for treating Yan Peixing, yesterday.</p>
<p>Puji Sanatorium, Dr. Huang's Speech</p>
<p>Dr. Huang believes that Yan Peixing definitely has a mental illness. In medicine, this disease is called "delirium," and its Western name is Paranoia. Patients sometimes have symptoms of restlessness, insomnia, and heart weakness. There are no special changes in appearance or physiology. In terms of mental capacity, it gradually declines, and after a long time, it will inevitably become dementia. Yan Peixing was sent to the hospital this time with a letter of introduction from the Health Bureau (the source of the Health Bureau's letter of introduction will be described later) and based on the disease report from his family member, Ai Baoying. During the more than forty days that Yan spent in the hospital, he was given one injection of cardiotonic, one injection of morphine, one injection of sleeping pills, and five injections of brain tonics. The so-called eight injections of toxic anesthetics were actually like this. As for the scars on Yan Peixing's wrists, Dr. Huang explained that all mental patients sent to the hospital generally do not admit that they are sick and clamor to be discharged. Therefore, the hospital can use a leather glove to cover the patient's hands when necessary. The leather gloves are tied with straps between the wrists. The scars on Yan Peixing's wrists were caused by struggling after wearing the gloves. Also, Yan Peixing said that the hospital demanded 1 billion yuan to release him. Dr. Huang said that the fact is this: After Yan entered the hospital, he initially said to Huang: "Please help me and connect me with a friend. After I get out, the factory will give you a big position." Later, he often said to him: "Come, come, don't let others hear. You can ask for money, how about 300 million or 400 million?" Yan also said this kind of thing to the tea boys and nurses in the hospital. Huang Yingbang always said, "I will definitely find a way to help you," to comfort him, just like comforting most mental patients. The demand for 1 billion yuan is absolutely not true. "If I really wanted to extort money from him," Dr. Huang said, "I could have let him out long ago."</p>
<p>A Letter of Introduction from the Health Bureau</p>
<p>The content of the letter of introduction from the Health Bureau is as follows: "This Bureau has learned that citizen Yan Peixing, No. 39 Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, is currently suffering from mental illness. His family and friends are willing to send him to your hospital for treatment at their own expense. Please accept him. To the Puji Sanatorium. Director Zhang Wei." The reporter went to visit Director Zhang Wei yesterday but did not meet him. According to Chief Secretary Cao, on February 7, Yuan Baoying brought the strange characters and photos written by Yan Peixing to meet with Director Zhang and applied. On February 8, Director Zhang wrote "Can be introduced to Puji Sanatorium" on official business, so the Health Bureau issued the letter of introduction.</p>
<p>A Series of Complex Contradictions</p>
<p>Yuan Baoying, who accused Yan Peixing of having mental illness, also said yesterday that Yan's mental illness is hereditary. His grandmother had mental illness, and his younger sister also has mental illness. When she was 21 years old, she had an attack and was naked, but Yan Peixing said that this was absolutely not the case. Also, their daughters, the eldest of whom is fifteen years old, was asked by the reporter yesterday if her father had a mental illness. She said that he had a little bit. She often went to visit him after he entered the hospital. Later, the reporter asked Yan Peixing about this. Yan said that his daughter was helping her mother, and that his seals were stolen by his daughter. Yuan Baoying said that she had cut a piece of meat from her body for Yan Peixing to eat for his illness. When the reporter asked Yan Peixing if this was true, he smiled and said, "There is no need to talk about the past." At this time, the relatives next to Yan said that there was a knife mark on Yan's back, which was stabbed by Yuan Baoying. Yan smiled when he heard this, as if he was unwilling to reveal it. This series of complex contradictions is truly a big mystery—does Yan Peixing have a mental illness? (To be continued in the lower right corner)</p>
<p>Bizarre Photo of Yan Yuanbaoying Kneeling and Bowing to Yan Peixing</p>
<p>Yan Peixing's Expression When Reporting (Photo by This Newspaper)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Mrs. Yang Hu's Letter of Testimony: Defending Senator Hou <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from the upper left corner) When Yan Peixing was sent to the hospital, were there armed comrades escorting him? This is the second focus of the case. Yuan Maiying said yesterday that she had asked two policemen from the Hongkou Police Station for assistance at the time, but there were no armed soldiers involved. The reporter also asked people at the Puji Sanatorium yesterday if there were armed individuals when Yan was sent to the hospital, and they said they couldn't remember clearly. According to Yan and Yuan's eldest daughter, there were two cars in total when they went; her father, mother, and cousin (i.e., Yuan Baoying's nephew) were in one car, and she didn't know who was in the other.</p>
<p>After Yan Peixing entered the sanatorium, how did his Huaxing Hardware Factory change to Southeast Hardware Factory, and how did Hou Jiyuan become the general manager? This is the third focus of the case. At Yuan Baoying's reception yesterday, there was a letter of testimony written by Mrs. Yang Hu, Tian Shujun, in Nanjing on the 30th and brought to Shanghai by overnight train. The original text is as follows: "This is to certify that Mr. Hou Jiyuan absolutely did not embezzle Mr. Yan's factory or property. At the end of the thirty-fifth year, Mr. Yan's mother sought assistance from Dong Zhujun because her nephew had moved away the factory's assets. Ms. Dong Zhujun informed me of this injustice and asked for my utmost assistance. I then entrusted Senator Hou to report to the police station to recover the items that had been moved from Mr. Yan's factory. Later, the police station investigated and recovered all the original items and handed them over to Mr. Yan. At this time, Mr. Yan, due to being deceived and infringed upon by his nephew, suddenly became mentally ill and was unable to work in the factory. All matters in the factory were managed by Mr. Yan's mother. Therefore, Mr. Yan became ill and was admitted to Puji Hospital for treatment, where he remains to this day. Due to the heavy workload in the factory, Hou Jiyuan was hired as the general manager of the factory, but it was only a nominal position, and the actual responsibility was managed by Mr. Yan's mother's nephew. Unexpectedly, Mr. Yan's nephew again incited the workers to move away the property and falsely accused Mr. Hou and Mr. Yan's mother of having an ambiguous relationship and embezzlement, which is a rumor to mislead the public. This nephew's fabrication is outrageous. In order to uphold justice and not allow this villain to distort the facts, I testify that Mr. Hou is an upright and enthusiastic person and absolutely did not embezzle anything, and that Mr. Yan's nephew should be held responsible for illegal deception, infringement, defamation, and other misconduct."</p>
<p>The Female Boss of Jinjiang Admits to "Intervening for Injustice"</p>
<p>Ms. Dong Zhujun, the owner of Jinjiang Sichuan Cuisine Restaurant, who served as the intermediary, was a friend of Yan Peixing and his wife before the war, having been in the yarn business. At the reception yesterday, she readily admitted that this matter was entirely due to her "righteous indignation" because Yuan Baoying came to her crying and asking for help because the factory's property had been embezzled by her husband's nephew. She "intervened for injustice" and then asked Tian Shujun and Yang Hu for help, and Hou Jiyuan came to "organize" it on her behalf, only serving in a nominal capacity. "Mr. Hou even put in a lot of money," Ms. Dong said. "So now that this has happened, I really feel sorry for him." As for why Huaxing Factory was renamed Southeast, Yuan Baoying said that it was because her husband developed a mental illness and made a mess of the factory. There were many bounced checks issued to the outside world, and the reputation was ruined, so she sent her husband to the hospital for treatment and asked someone else to rename and reorganize the factory.</p>
<p>However, Yan Peixing's side and the Wuxi Fellow Association righteously pointed out: Even if Hou Jiyuan was hired as the manager, Yan Peixing is not dead, so how could his Huaxing Factory be renamed Southeast? How could Hou Jiyuan register with the Social Affairs Bureau? The notice written by Hou Jiyuan in the factory using the official stationery of the Municipal Council has been photographed by them as one of the pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>This complicated family dispute, involving military hospitals and municipal councilors, is extremely bizarre. Exploring its root cause reveals the manipulation of a huge fortune. Yan Peixing's hardware factory property is said to be worth about 30 billion yuan. Although his relatives or outsiders absolutely deny any attempt to covet his property, this case is bound to be seen in court in the near future.</p>
<p>Await Forensic Identification</p>
<p>Yan Peixing and Yuan Baoying, from their appearances, both look honest and kind, but their feelings have broken down to such an extent. The outcome of this case will depend on whether the forensic doctor comes on April 12 to identify whether Yan Peixing has a mental illness, because Yuan Baoying has already applied to the court to "prohibit Yan Peixing from managing his property." The court had originally scheduled a forensic doctor to conduct a joint identification with the鉴定医生 of the Puji Sanatorium at 10:00 a.m. on April 12. The mystery of this sensational Shanghai "madman" will be revealed at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Owners Eager to Sell, Sales Stagnant: Rice Prices Continue to Fall in North and South Markets; Edible Oil, Flour, and Miscellaneous Grains Decline Across the Board <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market continued its downward trend from the previous day, with prices in both the north and south markets falling by about 100,000 yuan. Due to further short selling in Wuxi's quotations, owners had no choice but to depreciate prices, and sellers followed suit, but sales were stagnant. Rice shops on this street, due to the imminent distribution of rice for the second phase of household registration, were reluctant to replenish their stock, so owners were eager to sell, but there were few buyers. Transactions were sluggish, and morale was low. White japonica rice in the South Market has fallen to 3.4 million yuan. Inferior Wuxian rice has fallen below the 3 million mark, at 2.9 million yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan each fell by 100,000 yuan. The People's Food Allocation Association sold spoiled white japonica rice and early rice in the South Market at several different prices, totaling 1,020 shi. The total amount of rice arriving in the north and south markets was 6,572 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>All brands have retreated to within 1.4 million yuan. The reason is nothing more than the decline in rice prices and the sluggish prices in Suzhou and Wuxi, so the market has fallen into a long period of fatigue. Owners are eager to sell as quickly as possible, while buyers are hesitant. Lao Che flour opened at a low price of 1.38 million yuan. Bingchuan was briefly as low as 1.37 million yuan. The market rallied slightly at the close. Lao Che closed at 1.39 million yuan, and Bingchuan closed at 1.385 million yuan, still down 40,000 yuan from the previous day. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and other miscellaneous brands of flour all fell by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Wheat bran first fell, then was picked up by some at a low price, resulting in an increase of 10,000 yuan. Wheat was at 2.05 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Morale is low. Those who hold goods are eager to sell, while those who want to buy are hesitant. Soybeans, although barely supported yesterday, plummeted by 150,000 yuan yesterday. Zhadou fell to 1.65 million yuan. Corn sales remained sluggish, falling another 50,000 yuan. Red beans and green beans each fell by 50,000 yuan. Qingping was sluggish. Sesame seeds were not taken by Tianjin dealers, falling by 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were not touched by Guangdong dealers, falling back by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The downward trend has expanded. Soybean oil plummeted by 400,000 yuan due to the continuous supply from factories and the return of retail investors. Factory soybean oil was mostly at 7 million yuan. Datong and Tongfeng soybean oil once retreated to within 7 million yuan. Raw oil also fell sharply by 400,000 yuan. Owners were eager to sell, but actual sales were sluggish. Qingdao Jiton raw oil was at 8.35 million yuan. Dade New Oil Factory opened raw sesame oil at a low price of 7 million yuan, falling by 600,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil also fell by about 400,000 yuan. Other edible oils all fell across the board. Owners of small car sesame oil were less willing to sell, with the smallest decline, only 280,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were stagnant, falling another 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 31st] The rice market in Suzhou today, due to the unanimous decline in prices in Wuxi and Shanghai, morale softened, and trading sharply decreased. The highest price for brown japonica rice was 2.95 million yuan, white rice was 3.39 million yuan, and the price of upper-grade white rice sold at stores was around 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Report from Fuzhou, this newspaper, 31st] The rice market remains stable, at around 3.5 million per shi.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Wuxi Rice and Wheat Downstream <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi, this newspaper, 31st] Today, prices of goods both rose and fell. Rice and wheat are still downstream, while yarn and oil are rising.

<h3 id="e94">Sugar Falls Again <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw sluggish sales and a further decline. The association's assessment of spot prices for 24 crude white sugar was 4.5 million to 4.45 million yuan, down 150,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half white sugar in bags was 4.9 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan. Sugar in straw sacks was 4.7 million yuan, and 20 medium sand white sugar was 4.2 million to 4.15 million yuan, down 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

<p>Local Shantou Qing sugar was 2.953 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan, with about 200 bags traded. Xingbai sugar was 4.45 million to 4.4 million yuan, with little fluctuation. Xingchi sugar was 2.95 million yuan, down 50,000 yuan. Diaoging sugar was 2.7 million yuan, with few transactions. Hainan Chi sugar was 1.95 million to 1.9 million yuan, down 50,000 yuan, with less than 100 bags traded.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Tea Market Appears Flat but Actually Rising <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, red and green tea dealers continued to hoard and hold onto their goods, and buyers, feeling that domestic sales were good and foreign demand was urgent, continued to seek out goods at good prices. Prices rose across the board, but some varieties did not show significant gains because the quality of the goods was uneven compared to before, resulting in a situation that appeared flat but was actually rising. It is also learned that the French North African branch of Concorde Foreign Firm has telegraphed Shanghai, requesting to purchase a large quantity of green tea, but due to the limited inventory, it may be difficult to ship smoothly for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="e97">China-Korea Trade to be Restored Soon: Tianjin and Shanghai Designated Temporarily <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Beiping, this newspaper, 31st] China-Korea trade will soon be officially realized through the designated ports of Tianjin and Shanghai. However, restrictions will be quite strict to avoid exchanging daily necessities for consumables, which would affect the supply of major materials in our country.</p>
<p>It is learned that although private trade between China and Korea has not been opened since the victory, it has never actually stopped. Most of the smugglers are Koreans, and a few are Chinese. The smuggling vessels are all hundred-ton sailboats. There are about 30 such ships traveling between Tianjin and Korea. The goods traded from Tianjin to Korea include glass, glue, belts, chili peppers, food, white spirits, and Chinese medicine. The goods traded from Korea to Tianjin include rayon, caustic soda, wood, seafood, ginseng, and glass sand. The smuggling method is for ships carrying goods to Korea to declare to the Tianjin Customs and open to Qingdao and Yantai. After being released, they change course to Korea. When returning to Tianjin with goods, they repaint the ship and use the name of returning ships of Chinese citizens to declare customs and pay taxes. In addition, there are many who avoid customs and smuggle through detours. In the future, if the opening of China-Korea trade is restricted too strictly, smuggling between China and Korea may still be unavoidable.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Collection and Payment of Treasury Funds in Various Regions: Adoption of Zonal Transfer System <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] Since the implementation of the Measures for the Deposit and Remittance of Public Funds by Military and Political Agencies, the Central Bank, in order to promote treasury administration and assist the industry in dealing with the position of treasury funds remitted by various treasury agents on behalf of military and political agencies, has made every effort to transfer funds and facilitate the process. It has also formulated the "Three Banks and Two Bureaus to Apply to the Central Bank for Free Transfer of Funds When Transferring Treasury Funds in Accordance with the Measures for the Deposit and Remittance of Public Funds by Military and Political Agencies," and circulated it to various branches for reference. However, in the past, there was no standard for the allocation locations. For example, for the remittance of funds in Sichuan, some designated to be repaid in Guangzhou, which was inconsistent with the facts and violated the government's financial control policy. It is learned that the new treasury receipt and payment accounting system formulated by the Ministry of Finance has been scheduled to be implemented from 1948. The procedures for the collection, payment, and reporting of treasury funds in various regions will all adopt the zonal transfer system. All treasury fund transfer matters within each zone will be the responsibility of the Central Bank of each sub-treasury for each zone. In the future, the position of treasury funds transferred by various treasury agents will be handled by each sub-treasury and facilitated as much as possible. However, the allocation location should also be limited to the area where the bank where the remittance arrives is located, and cross-regional allocation is not allowed, in order to reflect the facts and comply with the government's financial control policy.</p>

<p>[News from this newspaper] It is learned that since the promulgation of the Banking Law, the ordinary deposit reserve and savings deposit guarantee reserve that each bank should pay have been uniformly changed to the deposit guarantee reserve.

<h3 id="e101">The Central Trust Bureau is Ordered to Promote Barter Trade <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>This year, the Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to continue to strengthen the promotion of China's foreign barter trade. China's barter trade with foreign countries is most extensive with Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At present, barter trade with Japan is still mainly based on importing rayon and sleepers, and exporting soybeans and sugar. Salt, which is urgently needed by Japan, cannot be exported this year because the Salt Administration has not yet approved the amount available for barter this year. According to sources, if barter trade with Japan for salt cannot be restored, the future is unlikely to be optimistic. Moreover, China's outstanding barter accounts with Japan from last year are currently in urgent need of repayment and settlement. As for barter trade with the United States, there has been no large-scale export or import this year. The items bartered are mostly tea, tung oil, and pig bristles. However, the United States often criticizes that the quality of China's existing export goods is worse than before, and it is often impossible to purchase the same goods at the same price. This concerns the reputation of international trade, and it is hoped that the relevant management authorities and loan authorities will strictly manage to improve the quality of goods to facilitate exports. Barter trade with the Soviet Union is mostly export and less import. Because the government has not yet approved its list of materials and quantities this year, it has not been officially launched. The quantity of barter trade with other countries is very small. Recently, the exporting authorities have encouraged the promotion of China's specialty products, porcelain and firecrackers, to foreign countries. If sales are strong, the foreign exchange and materials exchanged can also greatly compensate for foreign exchange expenditures.</p>

The Ministry has now requested that they be increased. The application will be made after approval. (5) The hourly wage for teaching staff is paid according to the one-tenth index, which is handled in accordance with the old case and is not considered low. The request to increase it is difficult to approve. (6) All technicians established by each school should be统筹 (tǒngchóu, make overall plans) and allocated within the total number of approved workers. If there is an insufficient supply, a special request should be submitted for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Electronic Gun Starts, Electric Clock Times: The Scientific Equipment of the World Games, Venue Layouts Rely Heavily on Science <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>[News from the British Information Service in London on the 31st] When the Olympic Games open in London on July 29th of this year, it will be seen that every effort has been made to ensure that there are no disputes caused by chance luck in the competition, such as competitors at the starting point gaining unexpected advantages due to "the luck of the draw", or at the finish line due to hasty decisions. Where human power is insufficient, scientists and technicians will make it as flawless as possible. In the past, there was a lot of debate about the starting position of the players, because it was thought that the person farthest from the starter would hear the gunshot some fraction of a second later than the person closest to the starter. This criticism can be avoided in this session, because the gun will be fired by remote control. This gun is sixty yards away from the starter and equidistant from each player. This starting gun also makes the timing accurate to a degree. At the finish line, there will be a specially made camera to take pictures of the exact situation when the first six finishers arrive. This photo can be developed in one minute.</p>
<p>There is another strange problem on the venue that must be solved by scientists, that is, what kind of fuel should be used for the Olympic flame so that it can burn continuously in any climate. This flame will be placed in a three-holed earthen basin six feet in diameter, standing on top of an eighty-foot height in the venue. The torch will be lit from the torch relayed from Olympia, Greece, to England. Compressed gas will be continuously injected into this basin so that it can burn regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>The resident engineers of Wembley Stadium also encountered many particularly complex problems. The original activities of the stadium will continue until July 10th, and the opening date of the conference is July 29th. In this short period of time, it is necessary to work day and night to reproduce the track and field course originally built in 1924 from the dog and car racing tracks and level it. Then the conference track must be accurately measured without an inch of difference, and its slope must not have an error of one thousandth of an inch.</p>
<p>Wembley Swimming Pool is the location for swimming and boxing competitions. The ice rink needs to be converted into a swimming pool first. This work includes removing ten miles of salt water pipes and eighteen hundred feet of tubular stands. The entire pool must be repainted, and electrical lines must be reinstalled. Accurate measurement is also essential. After the swimming competition is over, the swimming pool must be converted into a boxing venue again, which is done by building an eighty-foot bridge sign over the pool.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Review of "A Discourse on the National Assembly System" <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Hongchang</p>
<p>Written by Chen Yuxiang, published by Commercial Press, 315 pages, price 7 yuan.</p>
<p>The National Assembly is a unique institution in China's future new government. It is an institution representing the national people in exercising political power during the constitutional period. Furthermore, because the Constitution of the Republic of China was formulated by it, it is also the sole bridge for transitioning from the period of political tutelage to the constitutional period. The National Assembly, therefore, also has a distinction between being "constitution-making" and "constitution-implementing." Regarding the theory and system of such an institution, we have long desired a systematic work to analyze it. A few months ago, I purchased "A Discourse on the National Assembly System" written by Mr. Chen Yuxiang. After studying it, I feel that Mr. Chen's book has considerable value.</p>
<p>The constitution-making National Assembly was convened in the 35th year, but the dispute over this issue has existed since Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction. The preparation and holding of the National Assembly has also had a history of more than ten years. Books such as "Reference Materials for the National Assembly," "The National Assembly Problem," or "Special Issue on the National Assembly" that have been published on the market are not uncommon. However, these are nothing more than collections of laws, regulations, or fragmentary essays. If one wants to find a specialized work with a more systematic and in-depth study, in my experience, one has to recommend Mr. Chen's book.</p>
<p>This book is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter, "Principles and Methods of Democratic Politics," explains the general principles of very abstract democratic politics, as well as the complex definitions and concepts of democracy, in a span of about 10,000 words. It then addresses the drawbacks of modern representative politics, ultimately answering: "The question now is not whether we should adopt a democratic polity, but rather what method should be adopted to best avoid its unique shortcomings." The second chapter, "The Process of Implementing Democratic Politics in China," explains how China entered democratic politics, starting from the establishment of the political tutelage system to the formulation of the Constitution. The third chapter, "The Characteristics of China's Democratic Political System," provides a very important exposition on the spirit of the entire Chinese Constitution and the central political system of the new government. These first three chapters can be said to be the first part of this book.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, "The Preparation for the Convening of the National Assembly," and the fifth chapter, "The Evolution of the Organizational Law of the National Assembly," both refer to the constitution-making National Assembly. Although the constitution-making National Assembly only convened once and then concluded, its mission was unprecedentedly significant, and the process of its convening and the evolution of its constituent members were extremely complex. In these two chapters, the author not only describes and analyzes the historical facts of the convening of the National Assembly and its organizational law. The most commendable thing is that the author presents to the reader the background of the repeated postponements of the National Assembly, the causes and consequences of the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, the legislative intent of the organizational law and representative election law of the constitution-making National Assembly, technical issues, and its relationship to or conflict with the May 5th Constitutional Draft. Reading these two chapters, we can see the author's thorough research on this issue. These two chapters are the second part of this book.</p>
<p>Chapters six through nine are the third part of this book, and also the most important part of this book, accounting for one-half of the entire book. The sixth chapter describes the historical process of designing the National Assembly system, and various studies and proposals by the Chinese people regarding the National Assembly system over the past ten years are briefly introduced and commented on in this chapter. The seventh chapter is a purely theoretical study, the main purpose of which is to elaborate on the subtleties of the nature of the National Assembly. In this chapter, the author explains very thoroughly the boundaries and differences between the terms political power, governing power, ruling power, sovereignty, etc., and has unique insights into why the National Assembly is an organ of political power, expressing what others have not expressed. Chapters eight and nine are about the election and recall of National Assembly representatives and their powers during meetings. The National Assembly chapter of the Constitution of the Republic of China has a total of ten articles, which are analyzed in detail in chapters seven, eight, and nine, and relevant constitution-implementing laws and regulations are often cited as necessary.</p>
<p>The structure of this book is roughly like this. Overall, this book provides a relatively substantial discussion of all aspects of the National Assembly's historical facts, organization, powers, in a word, theory and system. Each chapter is followed by dozens of footnotes, either providing necessary annotations to the main text or listing the sources of reference materials, all of which demonstrate that the author was quite responsible in writing this book. The writing throughout the book is also very fluent. It is not easy to write such a rigid book and have such un-dry writing. It is only a pity that the name is the opposite of the content and easily attracts people's attention, because the word "discourse" is easily misunderstood to mean "describing without creating," so I hope the author will simply call it "The National Assembly System" or some other more appropriate title. I wonder if the author agrees?</p>
<p>One point we expect from the author is that this book was completed in mid-May of last year, while the decision on the allocation of National Assembly representative quotas was made later. Therefore, some election laws and regulations and technical issues of elections have not been discussed. This point, we can forgive the author, and the author has also said in the postscript that if there is an opportunity for a reprint in the future, it will be added and revised. We feel that this book is very perfect and worthy of attention from the academic community, but in order to make it even more perfect, we hope that a revised edition will be published soon.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Progressive Education at the Crossroads <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Progressive Education at the Crossroads by Boyd H. Bode.</p>
<p>Translated by Qin Xilian</p>
<p>First edition, October, 36th year, Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>"Progressive Education at the Crossroads" is a famous work of modern educational philosophy. The author, Boyd H. Bode, is a well-known American philosophy professor. His works such as "Fundamentals of Education," "Modern Educational Theories," and "Conflicting Psychology of Learning" have Chinese translations, which were widely circulated for a time. As the name suggests, this book describes various educational thoughts that are hesitating at the crossroads, and the essence of progressive education. The author objectively elaborates on many concepts that have been debated for a long time in educational thought, and points out the new path of education. The book shows us the philosophy on which progressive thought is based. The content of this philosophy, as Bode said, is derived from the meanings of "respect for individuality" and "maximum development" emphasized by the progressive movement.</p>
<p>Progressive education is a philosophical thought and also a movement that is widespread in society. It is based on liberalism and democratic ideals, and grows and takes shape. Its most prominent meaning is "child-centered," which means that it includes the concepts of "interest," "initiative," and "freedom." In terms of psychology, progressive education tends to the principle of "learning by doing." In terms of society, it emphasizes the development of individuality and stresses the value of cooperation and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>The author says in the preface: "If education is to be treated as a valuable vocation for adults, it must be based on a philosophy of social organization." He insists that respect for individuality and maximum development are a fighting doctrine. Bode believes that the practice of progressive education is mainly to make educational activities represent a correct way of life. This view is very correct.</p>
<p>He begins by discussing the relationship between progressive education and democracy. Progressive education respects freedom, but also values guidance; it values methods, but does not rigidly adhere to traditional curricula; it pays attention to the development of individuality, but also values social institutions. Because it values individuality, it is extremely opposed to "imposition." Education should fully develop the individual's ability to use the freedom of intelligence. All traditional beliefs and attitudes that hinder the development of individuality and intelligence must be transformed and revised.</p>
<p>Regarding liberal education and technical education, Bode believes that they are not opposed. The difference between the two is not that the former is solely engaged in the pursuit of truth, while the latter is purely seeking practical results. This implicitly illustrates the harmony between art and profession. It is wrong for technical education to be too inclined to mechanical training; it can also develop students' ability to appreciate. The author says: "When technical education reaches the point where students feel that it includes a whole way of life, it becomes liberalized."</p>
<p>There are many different theories about the theory of interest. The author starts from the psychological standpoint of progressive education. He believes that interest is mostly determined by the environment and is not entirely internal. Effort is related to interest, and the attractiveness of the environment, including the inspiration of teachers and the favorable conditions of a good teaching environment, are all factors in cultivating interest. We often misunderstand interest as an unlimited and vague pandering to likes. After reading Bode's argument, we will also understand that sugar-coated education cannot represent progressive education. The true meaning of interest should be "education becomes a program centered on constantly transforming experience towards a general pattern... It is not obtained by external imposition, but by students using their own intelligence."</p>
<p>In the section "An American Cultural Paradigm," the author says that American culture emphasizes cultivating intelligence rather than obeying authority. This educational system does not recognize certain absolute or final truths, because they limit social progress and the constant transformation and enrichment of experience. Progressive thought and education depend entirely on whether the goals of the entire life of society are in accordance with reciprocal or cooperative relationships. He has two very pertinent sentences: "Our educational theory must become a theory of social relations, or a theory of democracy."</p>
<p>Dr. Dewey had already elaborated on the meaning of "education is growth." Bode further elaborates on the true meaning of this, with the addition of recent research. He uses "education is a program of constantly reorganizing experience" to interpret what growth is and the direction of growth. Growth can refer to the motive power originating entirely from the student internally, or it can refer to the student's satisfactory response to the teacher's suggestions. The author warns teachers not to completely believe in "internal growth" without providing appropriate guidance; nor can they rely entirely on their own prejudices to carry out incorrect "external guidance" and force students to blindly accept.</p>
<p>The author, fearing that teachers in general overemphasize teaching materials and neglect the true meaning of education, puts forward the principle of "teach children, not subjects." He points out how fixed curricula and teaching materials block the development of students' thinking and the growth of their minds. Indeed, teaching materials are only a means, a method, a tool to achieve educational goals; the purpose of education is still to change behavior. Various subjects and teaching materials must truly achieve the purpose of "edification" and shaping character in order to have value. "Traditional education" disregards the child's nature... It assigns homework as a fixed amount of learning material, regardless of the laws or principles of psychological growth. The whole program becomes mechanized, sacrificing spirit or attitude. Yes, being educated and being taught materials are clearly different. The former is the spiritual realization and the change of attitude; the latter is only formal training and external coercion.</p>
<p>Finally, he concludes with a discussion of "the sociality of education." Bode believes that the ideals of progressive education should conform to the ideals of a democratic society. Therefore, a social philosophy that correctly explains social relations becomes something that researchers of education cannot ignore.</p>
<p>The content of this book cannot be said to be very substantial, but it represents a view of progressive education. The translation seems to be slightly lacking in fluency. If a more literal translation method is adopted, it may be more Sinicized and easier to understand the underlying meaning of the ideas. However, translating philosophical books is not easy in the first place. The translator has indeed put in considerable effort, and in order to "strive for accuracy," a literal translation is naturally necessary. I think that people who have a foundation in pedagogy, and who are used to reading English books or translations, will certainly not find it too difficult.

<h3 id="e138">Elementary School Music Teaching Materials <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>I remember when I was at the Fujian Conservatory of Music, I often received letters from outside asking for music teaching materials and inquiring about various teaching methods. At that time, I would send out some lecture notes piecemeal, and besides giving some rough answers to teaching difficulties, I would also guide them to find a few books to read. However, during the war, the publishing world, and the few barely usable books that existed, were out of print and unavailable for purchase. In the past two years, I have been traveling in Taiwan and Zhejiang, and have had a lot of contact with music teachers and future music teachers. The need for books in this area has become even more urgent. A month ago, while traveling in Jinhua, I found a book in a bookstore written by Mr. Miao Tianrui called Elementary School Music Teaching Materials and Teaching Methods. Seeing how detailed and innovative this book was written, I was really pleasantly surprised, so I am willing to write to introduce it to music teachers and normal school students across the country:</p>
<p>The text of this book is 113 pages, divided into nine chapters. In the first chapter, "Methods of Selecting Singing Teaching Materials," it is proposed that the lyrics should be colloquial, and that the works of only one or two people should not be sung forever, so as to avoid narrowing the children's musical interests. These are all based on experience. In the third chapter, "Sight-Singing Teaching Method," it is proposed that the method of writing music notation and singing with the finger score are neglected by general teachers. In the fourth chapter, "General Teaching Methods for Singing," it is proposed that seating arrangements should be grouped according to ability, which is extremely helpful for learning and management. In the same chapter, the starting pitch and calling beat are also common problems that general teachers often make. In the fifth chapter, "Vocalization Method and Height Correction Method," it is solemnly pointed out that when children sing, the first priority is to use head voice to sing, sing in a low voice, and develop towards high notes. In elementary schools today, I don't know how many teachers choose songs with very low ranges and teach children to shout desperately, damaging their vocal cords and making it impossible for them to produce beautiful singing for the rest of their lives! In the same chapter, the question of how to sing during the voice change period is raised. Ordinary teachers only know that singing is not suitable during the voice change period, but in schools without instruments or other equipment, children do not sing during the voice change period, and therefore become alienated and unfamiliar with music. Isn't this a great loss? The seventh chapter, "Other Musical Activities," is the material that is most needed in elementary school music teaching and is least mentioned in general music textbooks. In this chapter, the author proposes singing games, musician stories, dictation, concerts, etc. Readers will not find it difficult to draw inferences from one instance to another and gain inspiration for many ways to increase children's interest and learning efficiency! The ninth chapter, "Equipment and Others," has a method for repairing organs, which is the most practical guidance for elementary school teachers. The same chapter also mentions the American music supervision system, which is undoubtedly still a luxury in our country, but I would like to urge the attention of educational administrative authorities to establish such a good system that can help music teachers develop music education in the near future!</p>
<p>In addition, the writing of the whole book is simple and fluent, and there are many singing teaching materials attached, which are also the highlights of this book. The only drawback is that all the explanations and songs use numbered notation. However, friends who have printing experience and know that most elementary school music teachers today can only read numbered notation should not find it difficult to sympathize with the author's words in the preface, "In order to facilitate printing, I have to temporarily use numbered notation" and "If there is an opportunity for a reprint, I will change all the notation to staff notation"!</p>
<p>This publication welcomes submissions, but due to space limitations, each article should be limited to 1,000 characters. Royalties are settled at the end of the month and issued at the beginning of the following month. Inquiries are welcome, but if they are not claimed after three months, it will be considered as automatic waiver of remuneration. We hope you will understand. ——The Editor</p>
<h3 id="e139">Nikolai Nekrasov <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>Written by Chukovsky, translated by Yu Hongmo, published by Haiyan Bookstore</p>
<p>A person's soul and vitality are strengthened through tempering. The reason why I read biographies is that I can discover this truth in the experiences of others. In times of loneliness, it gives me spiritual support. When I am suffering from constant setbacks, it reaches out a helping hand and makes me climb up again. Because people have a strong instinct to hate mediocrity, and biographies use simple and realistic narratives to allow us to get close to all the most extraordinary people in thousands of years of human history, giving us various spiritual responses, making our lives colorful, and giving our hearts strength. That is the reason for biographies.</p>
<p>The life and works of the great Russian poet Nikolai Nekrasov have been introduced to our country very little until now. Now the publication of his biography is worthy of our reading.</p>
<p>After Pushkin and Lermontov, the great Russian poet was Nikolai Nekrasov. In fact, his status is no less than theirs. Dostoevsky later said in memory of Nikolai Nekrasov: "Nikolai Nekrasov is a poet who can be ranked with Pushkin and Lermontov." His brilliant achievements and the legacy he left in literature have earned him a lofty position. The families of poets, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, have unfortunately been unable to escape the fate of poverty and frustration. However, it is perhaps even more tragic for a poet of such talent and self-encouragement as Nikolai Nekrasov to become a beggar. He was born on December 4, 1821, in Yuzvina, a small county in the Podolia Governorate. His father was a landlord, a retired military officer, who led a dissolute life, addicted to alcohol and gambling, and had a violent temper. In his poems, Nikolai Nekrasov called his father "a stubborn uneducated man," "tyrant," "abuser," and "executioner." His mother was a woman who loved music and literature. Therefore, under the influence of such different parents, Nikolai Nekrasov naturally moved towards hating abuse, resisting violence, and using literature as a tool to express his will. In his youth, he became the "singer of the groans and tears of the masses."</p>
<p>In 1838, at the age of seventeen, he left home for the capital. However, in addition to the manuscript of a novel and some poems, he did not have a single kopeck in his pocket. Entering the literary world with such courage, he ended up with nothing to eat and no place to live, and spent the winter without a coat. Only an indomitable person like him could endure the arduous struggle with extreme poverty.</p>
<p>In the two years of work in 1840 and 1841, he wrote short songs, essays, miscellanies, poems, short stories and novellas, and reviews that could almost be compared with the lifetime creative output of other writers. This achievement is amazing, and from this we can imagine how great his perseverance was in the midst of hardship. Later, he continued to write with the same spirit. In his later years, he recalled his past life and wrote: "Several times I wrote all night without rest, almost without a second's interruption, until my legs became paralyzed and lost feeling. The lights were on, day or night, there was no difference to me. When the time came, I would go and do other work, and then return to this work."</p>
<p>Nikolai Nekrasov's acquaintance with the famous critic Belinsky was the most important turning point in the poet's life. Belinsky supported him with the utmost sincerity, enabling him to abandon his former gorgeous verses and begin to write about the lives of the abused and suffering people. The author of this biography says: "The keynote of his poems, because of the melancholy rhythm, the straightforward crying and weeping, has become a rare curse and complaint. The supple rhythm becomes a constant flow of soothing sounds and words. These poems are almost evidence of the human suffering caused by cold, hunger, oppression, disease, and poverty." This is the true color of Nikolai Nekrasov's poems, but it was all influenced by Belinsky.</p>
<p>Nekrasov bought the publishing rights to the magazine "The Contemporary", which had been created by Pushkin, in his later years, and after that his work was concentrated on editing the magazine. Because of editing this magazine, he cultivated many excellent new writers, such as Dostoevsky, Goncharov, and Tolstoy, all of whom he paved the way for. This is something worth emphasizing. The brave poet, who had struggled for art all his life, died of illness on December 27, 1877.</p>
<p>This biography describes the poet's lifelong struggle and his great achievements. What unfolds before us is the development of a talent for beauty and goodness, the building of a noble personality, and the struggle with circumstances in order to achieve the final purpose of life. Many foreign artists were inspired by reading the biography of Leonardo da Vinci. Now our lives and environment are falling into a state of lethargy and weary melancholy, and we are trying to get out of the bondage of this feeling as soon as possible. At this time, if we read the biographies of others to the point where they have fallen into the same trials as ourselves, we will feel a lot lighter. At the same time, reading about how our admired predecessors have struggled through the period of melancholy can naturally be a kind of warning and encouragement to us. The Nikolai Nekrasov biography is a good biography for us in the struggle against poverty.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Saying of All Fools <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Why Bother</p>
<p>The Westerners' creation of April Fool's Day likely belongs to the elegant pastimes of the upper classes in Europe and America. Its essence lies in showing off ingenuity and competing in intelligence, similar to Chinese poetic riddles and literary puzzles, although there is a slight difference in the sentiments of Eastern and Western cultures. Since the eastward spread of European customs, April Fool's Day has also been transplanted to China. Especially in recent years, the news pages, whenever April 1st arrives, stimulated by the tense political situation, awaken people's "news brains." Reporters, in order to relax the readers' emotions, often arrange a few "fooling" news items to provide a bit of relief, causing the readers to burst into laughter after being "fooled." Perhaps this is in accordance with the principle of "a balance of tension and relaxation, the way of civil and military affairs," and there is originally nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>I read the newspapers every day and deeply feel that living in today's China, it would be best if every year was April 1st, so that when we read certain depressing news, we could just consider it the news agency's "fooling" news and feel the comfort that the facts may not be entirely true. Has the four-power agreement on the control of Germany collapsed? No, it's just a fool's message. Does Japan want to follow in Italy's footsteps and demand the return of Okinawa? No, it's "fooling" news broadcast from Tokyo. Things like this are hard to describe. If it were all just playing "fooling" tricks, wouldn't that be the world's fortune? Originally, "life in this world," apart from malicious deception, is also a matter of you deceiving me and me deceiving you, using well-intentioned deception to reduce mutual disputes and maintain a gentlemanly demeanor of kindness. Therefore, even though it is clearly going abroad for pleasure, one insists on saying it is for illness and medical treatment, or to study geography; even though it is clearly a deer, it can be pointed to as a horse; even though one clearly hates the lively play of children, one still scares them with "the tiger is coming to eat the loudest child"... From this point of view, the Westerners who like to play tricks are not as good as the Chinese in their skillful use of "fooling" tactics. They only set a holiday, stipulating that one can only fool people on April 1st, while the Chinese are constantly thinking of using fooling methods to make up for the face of a fallen gentleman, or to achieve a selfish goal. We only see a few "fooling" news items published in the newspaper on April 1st, but we are already numb to the "fooling" words and deeds that are being created at all times, which the Westerners who created April Fool's Day could never have foreseen.</p>
<p>Thinking further, are the April Fool's Day news stories really "fooling" people? Most of the fabricated stories, on the surface, seem to be "fooling" people, but their inherent meaning may represent an intention, a truth. For example, suppose today someone publishes a fooling news item in the newspaper, saying that on April 16th, coins with a fixed value will be issued to replace today's legal tender. This kind of news caters to the readers' psychology and also expresses the general public's desire for a currency with a fixed value. Also, suppose today someone creates a news item saying that a certain movie star committed suicide due to a love affair. This would indeed make those who care about the movie star uneasy, and at the same time, it would use the movie star's appeal to attract readers to take a closer look at the "fooling" report, which in fact illustrates a tragic path for modern lovers.</p>
<p>The people who create fooling news think they are scheming and playing with a colorful pen to fool people, but they don't realize how "smart" they are, because they themselves are in a large circle of a fooling world. And the fooling news that they painstakingly create may not be enough to fool people, but it reveals a bit of natural "divine secrets" in another way—that is, a verse saying:</p>
<p>It is laughable that the fooler,</p>
<p>Is also being fooled by others,</p>
<p>In this vast world,</p>
<p>Fooling others is fooling oneself!</p>
<p>In fact, it is not fooling,</p>
<p>There is truth in it.</p>
<p>Western April Fool's Day,</p>

<p>— Yi Chu</p>
<p>I once saw such a story: A family had a boy, and the whole family was overjoyed. At the one-month celebration, they brought him out for the guests to see, naturally wanting some auspicious omens.</p>
<p>One said: "This child will be rich in the future." He then received a lot of thanks.</p>
<p>Another said: "This child will be an official." He then received a few compliments.</p>
<p>Another said: "This child will die in the future." He then received a beating from everyone.</p>
<p>That the child will die is inevitable and true, but saying it out loud resulted in a beating. As for becoming rich and an official, it is still very uncertain, but these irrelevant and false words, on the contrary, pleased people. The first two guests understood the art of speaking, and they applied it skillfully.</p>
<p>Extending this further: a hypocrite who has five concubines will also scold the world for being depraved and morals for being in decline, and even organize a "Society for Rectifying Customs." A speculative profiteer will also condemn profiteers for having no conscience and demand that the government strictly prohibit them. As for corrupt officials, of course, they say they are the most honest, with clean sleeves and loving the people like their own children. Sometimes—when I haven't shaved for more than a month and am wearing a wrinkled gray cloth gown—if I happen to run into a wealthy friend, before I can even say hello, he starts lamenting his poverty, as if he specifically sought me out to complain. Moreover, judging from his tone, he is so poor that he can barely afford to light a fire at home and needs someone else to help him. Although he doesn't ask me for money, I am so scared that I leave him early. When old maids receive tips from their mistresses, they also hide one hand behind their backs and keep saying, "No, no." But if the other hand doesn't actually come forward to take the money, it must be because they think it's too little. When ladies chat, you hear them say, "Mrs. Zhang is so beautiful, it takes her three hours a day to put on makeup. I'm just so-so." "Mrs. Li has billions of private money, I can't save a penny." It's as if they are complaining that they don't know how to dress up and don't have private money. But in fact, they are telling you: she is naturally beautiful and doesn't need makeup; her husband's money is managed by her, so there's no need to hide it. If you don't "listen to their words and observe their actions" like Confucius, then you will definitely be fooled!</p>
<p>If there is an art to speaking, it is lying.</p>
<h3 id="e142">"Reimbursement Politics" <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>I often feel that Chinese bureaucrats have two great skills that foreigners cannot match. These two great skills are: (1) filing reimbursements; (2) making work reports. As for whether orders can be carried out, or whether the "work" has been thoroughly done, these seem to be secondary matters. As long as the reimbursement is filed neatly and the full amount of public funds is received, it is considered that the work has already been promoted; when a large stack of work reports has been completed in a circle from bottom to top, layer by layer, and is covered with dust in a remote corner of a certain official office—well, the "work" has been completed, and the performance evaluation can have a basis.</p>
<p>For lack of a better term, let's call it "reimbursement politics."</p>
<p>The most standard example of "reimbursement politics" is the recent sudden announcement by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau that it would again be holding a city-wide registration of wireless radios, and that the deadline was the end of March. When this matter was first announced, the tone was quite stern. The end of March has already arrived. What is the result of the registration? Yesterday, I ran into an old classmate who has worked in the Telecommunications Bureau for many years, and I asked him what was going on. He couldn't help but laugh and said, "There are quite a few foreigners registered!" As for the Chinese, he said that even the staff of the Telecommunications Bureau themselves mostly ignore it—even the radios of the staff living in the Telecommunications Bureau's dormitory have not been registered.</p>
<p>I laughed too, and asked him, "If you don't register after the end of March, will the Telecommunications Bureau take any action?"</p>
<p>He said, "I'm afraid not."</p>
<p>In fact, if the Telecommunications Bureau were to punish users for failing to register, we would be very willing to hear what legal basis they have. Moreover, what methods does the Telecommunications Bureau have to know that users have failed to register? Send investigators to investigate? Then we would also like to ask: what if I just close the door and don't allow them to come in to investigate? What law does the Telecommunications Bureau have the right to search people's homes? At the beginning of this constitutional government, government agencies should absolutely take the lead in advocating the spirit of abiding by the law!</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai are busy all day long running around for food and clothing. After finishing their public affairs, if they don't gamble or dance, but go home and sit on the sofa to smoke a cigarette and listen to the radio, it can be said to be the most basic enjoyment of being law-abiding. In my opinion, the government should reward this repeatedly. But now they insist on thinking of some unnecessary tricks out of peace and stability to trouble the people. Is it really because they are afraid that they cannot oppress the people!</p>
<p>If today's government wants to wash away the criticism of "incompetence," the first thing to do is to cultivate a down-to-earth and practical work style. As for the matter of wireless radio registration, I think they will first come up with "insufficient processing, extended for one month," and then, after one month, they will come up with "extended for another month," like a theater retaining a famous actor. Probably after two or three extensions of one month, everyone will have gradually forgotten about this matter, and the Telecommunications Bureau will take this opportunity to put away the awning and call it quits—and they can start drafting "work reports" again. Starting with thunderous speed and ending with a whimper, this is the formula for "reimbursement politics," and there are probably not many exceptions. But "reimbursement politics" is precisely the opposite of "a down-to-earth and practical work style." Although the matter of radio registration is small, we can once again clearly see the two big words "incompetence" in it!</p>

<p>For "daylight saving time," all clocks must be moved forward one hour; for "youth saving," many ladies slow down the clock of their lives by a few years. — The same kind of saving, the hours and years are inversely proportional, is it because developing new resources and reducing expenditures each have their own merits?</p>
<p>On the street, there are no French parasol trees and lawns, so we can't gather; how can we lack a trash can?</p>
<p>There are people in the world who jump from childhood to old age in one go, never having been young. But there are also people who spend their whole lives living young days.</p>
<p>People who are unreasonable are abnormal madmen; people who are deeply knowledgeable about the world are so well-balanced that they have no human touch. This is what is called it is difficult to be a person, and it is difficult to do things.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Dealing with People and Dealing with Things <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>Any matter in society cannot escape the relationship between people and things. Some people are very strict with their subordinates, but they are sloppy in handling affairs; some people have a consistent strict style in dealing with people and things, their words must be followed, and any delay will be followed by punishment. These people not only inspire awe, but also make people fear them. In my memory, the arithmetic teacher in elementary school who liked to use a teaching whip to "slap the palm" can be regarded as a representative of this type.</p>
<p>Indeed, the relationship between people and things is extremely close, and the two are not easy to separate. Being strict in handling affairs inevitably leads to jealousy or offending people. And those who are all-rounders and get along well with everyone often do things perfunctorily. Therefore, many people who are engaged in business in society often want to find a golden mean between dealing with people and dealing with things, so that they can handle things well and not cause any trouble in personnel matters. This is naturally a very difficult task, because if handled carelessly, it may offend many people and have the opposite result.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I received some inspiration from a publisher. After he handed over the manuscripts to the printing house for typesetting, he agreed on a delivery date and did not allow delays. But usually, if the printing house had a problem with the circulation of funds, he would provide some assistance, using both kindness and power. As a result, all the printing houses were willing to work for him. The method adopted by this gentleman can be summarized as: "Be generous to people and be serious about things." Extending its meaning, he never spoke harshly to the people he contacted on a daily basis, but for a thing, it had to be done well within the specified date. People who knew him well and understood his temper did not dare to delay. I think the eight words mentioned above are at least worth half a textbook on personnel management.</p>

<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen Remediation ()</p>
<p>Zhai also thought that his father was old, his mother was often ill, and his sister was still in Hankou, so he was very uneasy about leaving the old people, and the old people might not agree. If he lied to the old people, saying that the bank sent him out and he would be back in a few days, he would certainly not disapprove of anything. But if he left and never came back, the old people would definitely be uneasy. Zhu Zhai hesitated all day about this matter and could not resolve it. In the evening, he received a letter from Yunxiang. He opened it and saw that it read: "Zhu: I have been thinking about what you said today for a long time, and all the circumstances do not allow it. My will, I have thoroughly expressed to you the night before yesterday, and it will never waver. I do not want you to be frustrated for me and delay your future. After thinking again and again, the only thing is for you to go home, and in the midst of great disappointment, you can still get a trace of comfort. Your spirit should be placed in your career and reputation, not like before, immersed in the sea of love. You have always listened to me, this is my last contribution, I think you must adopt it. I have already written a letter to Fengsheng, I think you will be able to get Fengsheng's understanding when you go home. In this way, you will get comfort, your parents will get comfort, and I will get comfort too. Qing." After Zhu Zhai finished reading this letter, he frowned and said to himself, "Round and round, it is still this idea. If I don't go, I will disappoint her kindness, if I go, it really has no meaning." He took this letter and walked around the room, thinking for a long time before he decided that if he didn't go, Yun Qing would blame him, so he might as well go. If Fengsheng has any more signs of rejection, I will have more material to report to Yun Qing. Once Zhu Zhai had made up his mind, he immediately put on his clothes, went out to hire a car, and immediately rushed to Beixinqiao. When he arrived at the door, he saw that the gate was ajar, so he gently pushed it open and went in. Walking into the courtyard, he just met Fengsheng, who was holding a teapot and coming out of the house. When he saw Zhu Zhai, he asked loudly, "What are you doing here?" Zhu Zhai was very aggrieved in his heart. Seeing Fengsheng's attitude, he wanted to turn around and leave, but then he thought that this matter was originally my fault to her, and it is right for me to be angry with her today. With this thought, he smiled at Fengsheng and walked into the house. Fengsheng still had a stern face, sent the teapot into the kitchen, and walked out again. Zhu Zhai stood in the house with a smiling face to greet her, but Fengsheng ignored him and walked straight into the inner room.</p>
