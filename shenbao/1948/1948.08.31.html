<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕總統於頒布財經緊急處分令後，頃復就配合施行方面着令有關當局彙擬全面節約辦法，期得雙管齊下，迅速達到預期目的，而完成當前經濟改革任務。總統此項意見，首於廿九日召見翁文灝予以指示，並即指定翁文灝，王雲五，李惟果三氏負責草擬該項辦法，聞此辦法之主要原則，在仿照英國之節約辦法，實施全面管制。又關於節約方案之推進，政院節約督導委會亦將從事宣導。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕工商部長陳啓天，卅日下午曾召集穦司及有半各司長舉行會議，就財政經濟緊急處分令公布後，配合執行問題有所商討。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕全國銀行公會聯合會，全國錢業公會聯合會，上海錢業公會，上海信託業公會等四團體，頃電呈總統，擁護財政緊急處分令。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕各行局及商業行莊所有之外應，政府統盼於短期內繳存中央銀行，上週六翁院長除召集滬商業行莊領袖舉行座談會外，並會於四聯理事會散會後屢即在政院一號官邸約各國家行局首長談話說明政府意旨，各國家行局對此均表擁護，聞已決定一二日內由央行在滬召集其他行局商討繳存之技術問題。</p>
<h3 id="c2">行莊增資限期不變　商號最低資本額標準決定 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕銀行。錢莊·託公司提高資本額問題，除滬金融界領袖於日前翁院長召集之座談會中提出意見外，滬銀行·錢莊·信託三同業公會頃復呈文財部，請放寬「兩個月增達最低資本額」之期限，並認爲報載滬區銀行最低資本額原定爲一百萬金圓非大多數銀行所能負担，財部對於滬金融界及銀錢等業公會之意見，現正進行研究中。財長王雲五，財次徐柏園及部內主管高級人士，連日已數度商討，聞對於限定兩個月內增達最低資本額一點，決定不予變更，因此係總統頒布之財政經濟緊急處分令所規定，如輕易變更，將影響整個方案之尊嚴，惟對於最低資本額之數目因尚在擬訂中，尚未經政院核准，故已決定重行考慮，將來訂定辦法時，可能將銀行最低資本額改訂爲一百萬金圓以下。又財部卅日晨舉行會議，並無其事。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕根據財政經濟緊急處分令之規定，全國各公司，商號之資本額，均應折合金圓劵，重行釐訂，並應于六個月內爲變更之登記，工商部爲研討資本額之計算標進及最低資本額之數額，特於三十日上午邀財政部·資委會·主計部等機關舉行會議，由工商部商業司長鄧翰良主持，就上述各項問題交換意見。關於公司·商號最低資本額，已決定公司之最低資本額爲一千五百金圓，商號爲五百金圓，每股以一金圓爲標準。至資本額之計算方法，決定不重估資產，折合金圓時，將於下述兩種方法中任擇其一：一爲將公司成立時之資本額，按照當時之物價折合至卅七年八月十九日時物價倍數所值之法幣，再折合成金圓券。一爲將公司成立時之資本額折合至戰前時物價所值之法幣，再折合成金圓券，而後者折算時一圓金圓券應等於一元御二元金圓券始折合成一元，亦尚未決走，將請主計部提出抗載前至本年八月十九日之物價上漲倍數作爲計算標準，再談開會商討，預計於本週內將辦法擬訂，提出於下週之政務會議討論。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕四聯總處將於二日舉行三七一次理事會議，繼續討論上週六討論未完之貸款對象及範圍，並討論貸款審核及事後考核等事項。該會原係每兩週舉行例會一次，本週舉行例會，係上週六會上口頭約定者，目的在早日將貸款對象及範圍確定，現各國家行局負責人巳在滬就此問題專案研究中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕據四聯總處息；自財政經濟緊急處分令公布後，國家行局舉令停止辦理新放款，迄今仍朱開放，本月廿八日四聯總處理事會並未討論貸款案件，報載該會通過新貸款四筆說，非事實。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕杜月笙·王志莘等請求准許證交恢復營業事，政府對此尚未作決定。據某有關之主管人士卅日語記者，證交恢復營業，現有兩點值得顧慮，一爲自財政經濟緊急處分令公布後，一切物價及勞務價格均限定以八月十九日之價格爲準，如證交恢復營業，股票上市，將破壞限價之政策。一爲公司增資問題尚未決定，股票如仍以法幣面值上市，似有未妥，故證交之恢復，當在十一月廿一日法幣完全停止使用時爲止，催國營事業出一售時，將爲證交恢復之一時機，一但現在政府並未作恢復之決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交總經理王志莘，日前爲證交復業問題，會晋京向財政工商兩部有所請示，現已公畢返滬。據表示：當局認爲原則上復業無問題，惟日期現尚不一能確定。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕幣制改革後，政府歷年發行之法幣公債及外幣債券如何處理，亟爲一般人士所注意，玆據財政部公債司負責人面告，該部正就此問縝密研擬中，至所有本年八月底各種法幣公債到期應還付之本息，業經該部電請中央銀行並轉知各經理銀行一律暫緩兌付，靜候處理辦法施行。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州三十日電〕宋十文三十日下午三時乘機返抵穗，宋氏在港於廿九日會與港督葛量洪會晤，並共進午餐。衆信中港協定實施問題已獲具體結果，蓋該協定雙方原早已簽字，惟因港立法手續及種種技術問題，至由四月延至現在。宋氏返穗後，立即召開配糧及物價座談會，察份，霍賓樹等均被邀參加。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕立法院程序委會，卅日晨開會，決定九月七日開第二會期第一次會議，由孫院長致詞宣布正式復會後，即進行議程所列各事項，事先不另舉行復會式，各委員本會期席次，則將於報到時抽籤排定。據悉：第一次會議議程中，除報告事項外，將集中有關修改立院組織法及議事規則之議題，儘先提出討論，是類議題之要點約爲：（一）修改組織法第五條各委會召集委員產生辦法，第一會期之暫行辦法爲由志顧担任者抽籤決定，試行以結果，議事效率頗受影響，本會期擬仍改爲由各該委會委員互選推定。（二）修改組機法第八條，議案由立委提出者，原規定應先提出院會討論，事實上初步在院會中廣泛討論，取決費時，擬修改爲一切議案均應先付審查。（三）修改議事規則第年四條，原定每週星期二·五舉仃例會兩次，第一會期之經驗，多認爲過頻，擬修改爲每週舉行例會一次，如議案過多，可連續舉行數日。</p>

<h3 id="c27">如何塡補限價的漏洞？ <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>新幣制實行以來，一般反應，均甚良好，物價尤爲平穩，這固然是各地官廳奉行的努力，亦是一般民衆眞誠的擁護。如此上下相維，始終不懈，敢信新幣的成功，是確實可以把握得住的。</p>
<p>關於穩定物價這一點；小小的漏洞，並不是絕對沒有。這些漏洞，在目前，雖尚無關大局，但星星之火，可以燎原，我們爲防微杜漸，迅籌補救起見，不得不據實指出，以喚起大衆的注意。</p>
<p>第一，長沙物價普漲，以八一九爲標準，已漲起百分之七〇，最高者竟超過一倍以上，而地方當局迄今尚無動作。粗看起來，這是局部分的事，似乎無足輕重，其實各地物價的波動，是互爲表裹的，眞所謂銅山西崩，洛鐘東應，再敏戚也沒有。過去少數都市物價管制之失效，其主因卽在於是。試拿米價來做個例，上海實施限價，而各產區未能同時並進，便不得不卽予放棄，以免阻塞來源。米價如是，其他各種物價，亦何嘗不如是？所以限價這個制度，如果要求其維持不敝，非全面推動不爲功。</p>
<p>第二，據傳桐油一項，在本市雖已厲行限價，輸管會爲避免抬價競購起見，並已規定爲每磅兩角，而某產區以別有藉口，已任令漲價，且遠過八月十九日的市價以上。古人說得好，「牽一髮則動全局，」這種例外，是否要影響到其餘的物價，和他埠的物價，這是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>第三，就上海而論，有許多物資，還是來是匪區的，例如豬隻一項，大都來自蘇北。他們不會同時執行限價，自不必說。其接近匪區的地帶，據說也還有許多名目的捐稅和臨時費用，非但漫無限制，而且隨時調整，那自然要影饗到它的成本和限價。要解决這種困難，事實上確極棘手，但爲維持本市的供應和限價起見，卻也不得不設法予以克服。</p>
<p>第四，有許多商店和攤販，爲避免限價賣出起見，往往提早收市，或以次貨供應，這在菜市塲上，已是習見不鮮的事實。進本太高，虧本不願，他們也容有其不得已之苦衷。但須知此次普徧地執行限價，不是由於地方官一時權宜的措置，而是由於中央既定的國策，斷非暫時搪塞可以敷衍得了的事情。所以當業者應於進貨時共同努力，求其抑低，以謀合法的生存，不可因循瞻望，希冀寬假。我們這種建議，並不單是爲消費人脫法，亦不單爲穩定物價，擁議幣制，同時實亦爲維護他們的營業起見。</p>
<p>第五，成都電訊，以市府強制復業，厲行限價之故，商店存貨大多爲市民搶購一空，限價貨幾於絕跡，物價再揚云云。這事反映着好幾件事：批發市價，似乎沒有同時限得住，否則隨進隨出，限價貨决不會絕跡，此其一；商店藉端拒售，並不是良好的應付辦法，因爲愈拒售，愈易引起民衆的競買，此其二：執行限價，除掉運用政治的力量以外，同時不得不顧到經濟上的原則，卽再生產之維持，與來源之疏通是，此其三。自幣制改革令公佈以來，各部會所頒各項補充法令，爲數已不在少，但大都仍側重在管制的加強，與戰前底碼的恢復，而於生產的發展，和工業的促進，除掉行文之便，偶爾附帶一二句外，還沒有見到何等設施，這實在是一件失望的事。觀於上述成都限價貨搶購一空的故事，應該明白，經濟問題，總未可單靠政治手段來解央的了。</p>
<p>第六，整理財政的補充辦法，已經公佈，其中所定的新稅率和費用，頗多按戰時標準調整的，其他按照這個標準，尚在擬議中的，似也不在少數。這項標準。在目前統通恢復起來，到底是一否適宜，那是另一問題。不過現行的限價水準，卻與戰前並不完全一致。如果現價已經提高，而再按戰前標準予以抽稅，這是否會影響成本，其與當局維持限價的方針，又是否相符，這却值得注意。傳捲烟業以貨物稅將提高到戰前標準，成本既高，勢難維持八月十九日之限價，已推代表晋京睛顧，這便是一個實例。尤其是公教人員的待遇，比戰前削低得甚鉅，而仍要他們肩荷着戰前一樣的負担，這在情理上，是否可算平允，也未可加以漠視。我們也知道，平衡預算，是鞏固新幣制的主要條件之一，但維持限價的重要，決不在平衡預算之下，限價倘被衝破，恐怕沒有適當的辦法可資補救。所以任何收入，凡足以增加貨物的成本的，我們以爲，在目前，至少應暫從緩議。</p>
<p>總而言之，穩定物價，在目前是最重要的工作，大家應當急其所急，共向這個目標邁進。政府負有督導與促進的職責，尤應標本兼施，掃除一切障礙，以利金圓的推行·至於一切舉措，凡足以刺激物價，影響幣值的，在人民方面，固應由各地主管機關切實取締，隨時糾正，在政府本身，尤應以身作則，極力避免，以提高人民的信心。</p>

<p>〔合衆社莫斯科三十日電〕西方三國使節于今日下午二時（標準時間，上海節約時間下午十一時）赴克林姆宮，與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫作第八次會談。一般相信，關干談判之公報，將于三十日深晚發布。美國大使史密斯·英國專使羅伯茲及法國大使夏台岳在赴克林姆宮以前，會在法大使館作簡短會商，渠等無疑已對發布公報之詳細計劃，完全同意。史達林總理不致出席三十日之會談。一般認爲會談幾乎將全部集中于公報之計劃工作，可望宣布統一柏林通貨及蘇聯有效解除柏林地面封鎖問題，業已獲得協議。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎八月三十日電〕歐禮和總統今日會請前總理兼財政專家許曼出而組織新內閣。歐禮和此舉在賴瑪迪謝絕出任總理之後。總統於昨日午夜接獲賴瑪迪之拒絕書，旋即召見許曼，指示目下極左與極右派均欲掌權，故必須採取迅速行動。衆觀察家認爲馬里內閣之辭職，造成戰後法國政治方面之最嚴重危機，共黨與戴高樂之右派均欲爭取政權。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎三十日電〕前總理人民共和然許曼，今晨按受總統之請求，現正加速進行組閣嘗試，俾能獲得國民議會多數支持之足夠力量而組成聯合內閣。按許曼屬人民共和黨，在一九四七年十一月廿二日出任總理，至今年七月十九日，因議會投不信任票而辭職。賴瑪迪在許曼之前任總理。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三十日電〕巳黎報紙之評論，一致認爲許曼組閣之困難甚多。所有各報之評論皆一致認爲成立一項能爲各黨接受之財政經濟計劃，仍將爲許曼組成新閣之障礙物。接近戴高樂之保守派報紙「巴黎報」在其社論中稱，許曼將遭遇其前任總理之同一困難，渠首先須覓取一項可爲其閣員接受之經濟方案，然後再須覓取一執行此項方案之人員。該報對於許曼成功之機會，抱悲觀態度，其結論稱，如許曼組閣失敗，則祇有一人能挽救此項局勢，此人即國民議會之議長赫里歐是也。保守派之「法國晚報」預測許曼組閣之絕大困難稱，即使許曼獲得大多數人之擁議組成新閣，渠將對閣員之職位分配問題，遭遇嚴重困難，在此以外，尚有經濟復興計劃問題。解決此一問題之任務，其重要性實在其他一切問題之上。</p>

<p>〔合衆社香港三十日電〕左傾之「遠東公報」社論頃載稱，目前馬來亞叛亂之直接原因，在於英國之拒不遵守憲法上改革之諾言。該文特別指控馬來亞聯邦之新憲法，將中國居民置於「政治人被忽視之地位，而不國及中國居民之人數「幾佔馬來亞及新加坡全部人口之半數」。</p>
<p>該文繼稱，英國工黨政府在戰後於內閣聲明及白皮書中，會揭糜馬來亞之頗具「進步與改良性質」之政治制度。此等聲明會英政府已決定：（一）廢棄馬來亞統治者之特權；（二）建立以民主爲原則之馬來亞聯邦；（三）不論宗族，凡居住於馬來者均賦予公民權。「最後一項規定將使二百七十萬左右華人在英國所允許成爲自治聯邦中，得享受全部政治權利。」但「在一九四六年七月廿六日故總督眞德任命制憲組織時，遂顧與上述政策背道而馳。此一制憲組識計有官方代表五人，當地諸統治者之代表四人，及馬來亞凱旋堂之代表二人」。</p>

<p>在這風雲變幻的時代中，執政了五十年的荷籣威廉明娜女王，現在即將退休，由其女兒　麗安娜公主接位了。</p>
<p>有兩個原因將使咸廉明娜女王與歷代偉大的女王一同名垂青史，第一，她登基之早與在位之入，與偉大的英國維多利亞女王相似；第二，在其執政期間，政續之輝煌及果敢明斷，直可媲美英國另一位著名的女王伊麗莎白。所以有人說女王心目中以伊麗莎白女王爲模範，這種猜想是很合理的。在女王剛二十歲論及婚姻問題時，她說：「我難道不能像英國伊麗莎白女王般的淵習自執政嗎」？</p>
<p>但是話雖如此，女王到底和她自己選擇的人結了婚，有了承繼人，並且和伊麗莎白女王一樣把國家治理得興盛繁榮，使將來的歷史家將以一八九八年至一九四八年這一段時期命名爲「咸廉明娜時代」了。</p>
<p>女王生於一八八〇年八月三十一日。她父王威廉第三在一八九一年駕崩時，女王尚祗十一歲，在這樣小的年紀，她就做了一國之尊，由其母后攝政。</p>
<p>當時威廉明娜雖是正式的女王，但是她到底是個稺氣愛玩的女孩子，在酬酢塲上她有時也會開個小小的玩笑。母后很賢明的任她儘量快樂，當小女王有牴觸禮法的危險時，母后總能很機巧的設法消弭。小女王那種自然而稺氣的行爲，使大衆對她發生好感。一八九五年春女王訪問英國，其時歐洲最年青的女王威廉明娜與最年老的女王維多利亞在一起會晤了。在一八八九年前她遊歷各國時，總是儘可能的不和成人們在一起，而找年齡相仿的一起玩。</p>
<p>這遊歷實在是她在受教育以外所必需的消遺。她所學的課程是很廣泛的，包括世界史·荷蘭史·地理·德國文學·英法文·宇宙學·荷屬東印度政府·藝術史·宗教·軍事知識等·此外對未來的君王事務亦有指導練習，使她參加官塲宴會，後來並得自己舉行沙龍舞會，她並且常常有機會處理各種政治上的糾葛。</p>
<p>一八九八年八月三十日，藹瑪太后正式退休，次日女王就位，即發表其對人民之祝詞及第一次公告。女王該日之演詞中稱，「我將以我母親爲前例，並將終身奉行之，如我奧倫琪皇室公主所應該的那麼秉政。我將忠於我們的憲法，在我們荷籣國的名稱與國旗下，我至誠地說，我願維持在我國本土及東西殖民地的法治精神，並且儘我所能，爲此等地城謀精神及物質上的福利」。</p>
<p>女王與其丈夫在她父王死的那一年，在法國肯司地方已經見過。此後他們之間就沒有斷過聯繫。在女王及母后一同訪問了歐培克·勛堡伯爵夫婦，接着再訪問海斯·唐斯德大公爵之後，一切就都決定了。在這年的十月十六日就正式公佈了威廉明娜女王與梅克倫堡·許惠靈·享利公爵的訂婚。在一九〇一年三月五日，這位小女王就亳無政治性的遂了她的心願，正如她所說的：「我祗和我所愛的人結婚」。</p>
<p>八年之後，女王生了裘麗安娜公主，於是多年來對女王沒有孩子而將致奧倫琪皇系終止的恐懼已經消滅。在荷蘭人民的心目中，裘麗安娜·露慧·藹瑪·瑪利亞·威廉明娜公主的誕生，是一九〇九年的一件大事。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰中，女王堅決的態度給國內外與論界以深刻的印象。在這艱難的四年中，荷蘭始終維持中立，是爲其在經濟及軍事上堅定·自主·明斷及獨立熊度之例證。即使在最困難的情形下，荷蘭亦未會如比利時之被捲入世界大戰的漩渦中去。在這四年中，她不時振作其人民，促使他們團結一致，訓示他們忍受上帝給他們的負担，並在危急嚴重的關頭，給他們以鼓勵。最後人民到底不負女王的期望，這嚴重的浩劫終於是渡過了。</p>
<p>她的執政實在不是一件輕鬆的事，她必須克服經濟困難，促使國家的繁榮，並且還要抵抗軍事的侵略，尤其在最近的十年中，眞是艱難萬分。在她近六十歲時，希魔的納粹軍隊不宣而戰地進犯荷蘭，女王斷然下令全國軍民抵抗。雖然雙方實力懸殊，荷籣終於暫時被德軍所佔領，但是女王抵抗到最後一分鐘纔撤退至英國，不會屈服在納粹鐵蹄之下。她的勇毅不屈，使她更爲衆心所歸。</p>
<p>女王流亡在英國的五年中，仍舊規劃指揮國內的地下工作人員，作反納粹的努力，靜候重返故土。國內的人民也永遠把他們的希望和自由，寄託在女王身上。這一段時期中，她眞是備嘗艱辛，但是她的願望畢竟在戰爭末期實現了。盟軍一進荷境，她就駕返本土，著手推進荷籣的復興工作。</p>
<p>女王在荷蘭有史以來最黑暗的時代，表現出如此輝煌的成就，使她成爲荷蘭歷來最偉大的統治者之一。女王現年六十八歲，五十年來憂心國事，這偉大的女英雄實在巳經心力交瘁，需要一個休息的機會。所以已經決定把她已經發軔的艱鉅的復興工作，交給她的女兒裘麗安娜公主去繼續，去完成。</p>

<p>社會局長吳開先，昨日下午四時，召集本市各商業同業公會負責人，舉行談話會。上海區經濟督導員蔣經國氏亦應邀參加，說明政府管制物價及改革幣制政策。出席本市市商會·五金·南貨·北貨·米·雜糧·食油·粉麩·酒菜·紗業·棉布·綢布·百貨·橡膠·絲商·煤油·皮革·旅社·新藥·國藥·銀樓等八十一商業同業公會負責人共三百餘人。首由社會局吳局長報吿，略謂：此次政府頒佈財政經濟緊急處分令，改革幣制，穩定物價，上海區經濟督導員蔣經國先生將向各位報吿政府對此次新政之措施，幷希望聽取各位意見，以供參考。吳氏幷勉勵各商人協助政府，推行政策，尤望各同業公會負責人，轉吿各會員，一致遵行。吳氏詞畢，即由蔣督導員報吿稱：此次頒佈新經濟政策，改革幣制，穩定物價，期將過去物價天天上漲，生活指數月月加高，法幣日日增多，經濟危機日益嚴重之現象消滅，此事關係之大，等於前方勦匪，蓋目前政府之兩大任務，厥爲一面軍事戡亂，一面穩定經濟，以保障人民之生活，上海爲全國經濟重心，一週以來，全國人民均一致注視上海市塲動象，幸本市商界均能明瞭政府措施，一致協助政府執行政策，物價雖有極小波動，但大致尙屬安定。、</p>
<p>三委員會　各有任務</p>
<p>蔣氏幷謂：此次管制物價政策，係全國性的，先從安定市塲做起，對於物價決予澈底管制，嚴格執行八月十九日價格，不許變更，爲補救各業實際困難問題，將實施下列步驟：(一）設立物資供應委員會，專門供應本市市塲物資，包括工業原料等等，不致使供求發生問題。（二）設立物價審議委員會，執行八月十九日訂價，務使物價减低，但仍求訂價之合理，使零售商批發商均能得合法利潤。（三）經濟檢査委會負責檢査倉庫，嚴禁囤積居奇。蔣氏繼謂：商人良莠不齊，最近檢査倉庫，査出所存棉紗棉布，其中尙有勝利後堆存者，爲時已近三載。渠丹表示：以後對於棉紗棉布堆存逾時三月者，一律沒收，此舉幷非與商人爲難，而是執行命令，至對正當商人之困難，決予合法合理的解決，但對非法商人，決不顧一切情面，予以嚴懲。總之，渠希望做到：政府儘量供應物資，物價合理審議，嚴格檢査囤積。蔣氏以誠懇態度，希望上海商界予以協助，幷勸導各商人，勿存觀望態度，政府對新經濟政策，抱破釜沉舟之決心，決予澈底貫澈，希望爲整個國家人民着想，求得安定。蔣氏指出本市若干米商，以戶口配給米　　碎米，新藥及國藥價格，漫無標準，不特有違商業道德，且亦應受良心譴責．</p>

<p>蔣氏希望上海商界樹立良好風氣，以爲全國商業之模範。渠幷擬與社會局吳局長硏究，印製各項日用品價目表小冊，人民可憑規定價格購買，藉以安定人心。蔣氏最後希望各業提供意見。</p>
<p>至此吳局長特提出二點希望：（一）各商店貨物應一律標價，（二）售貨一律開發票。繼由酒菜業，西菜業，樹柴業，棉布業，酒醬業，紗商業，火油零售業，牛奶業，南貨業，鮮猪業等同業公會負責人陳述意見，要點爲（一）游資應設法導入正途，免致走向搶購物資。（二）劃分各業零售商與批發商之價格。（三）協助運輸。嗣經將氏最後結論：關於游資問題，最近將實施一具體辦法，使游資得有歸宿，一般物價決不能超過八月十九日價格，但必須做到合法·合理·合情。蔣氏並指出：最近渠曾獲悉，若干商店，竟雇用人員專門負責吃官司，但以後各商號如有違法情事，決拘捕老闆。渠對撿査人員之操守，極爲注意，如發現有舞弊貪汚情事，一經査出，決予嚴懲。渠相信如政府人員能與人民打成一一片，上下溝通，則新經濟政策必可順利推行，物價亦必可臻於穩定。</p>

<p>上海區經濟督導員蔣經國氏爲澈底執行抑平物價，打擊奸商，貫澈新經濟措施，昨日上午八時半特蒞市警察局，召集全體員警訓話。到各分局正副局長經檢大隊工作人員及其他單位共五百餘人，蔣氏首對經檢工作之重要性加以闡述，略謂：吾人欲使戡亂成功，前方固屬重要，而後方之經濟問題亦不可疏忽，二者必須加以配合，方可收成功之效，因之經檢工作，關係整個局勢甚鉅，故吾人執行經檢工作，必須澈底。蔣氏認爲執行此偉大艱鉅的工作人員，必須做到『不講情面，自身淸白」，公正嚴肅，方可完成使命。蔣氏繼對警察與人民之關係，喻爲魚之與水，警察如魚，人民如水，警察不可離人民，人民亦應協助警察。蔣氏最後希望全體警員與管制金融當局密切合作，使本市經濟得以平　，人民生活可以安定.九時許　氏始詞畢離去。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕判處無期徒刑之中央銀行竊盜金磚案要犯陳元盛與盜犯姜吉祥王海良三人，於本月廿四日晨大風雨中由上海監五樓越獄逃出後，治安當局偵騎四出，至昨晚十一時許始吿全部弋獲。</p>
<p>此案發生後，警察總局首先提同囚未逃之盜犯劉阿六訊究，並將所遺鋼鋸條棉紗帶等證物詳加硏究，劉供，曾聞陳姜等竊議越獄計劃預備於逃出後至白運涇乘姜叔自有之木船，駛往句容。警局人員急趨浦東，將白蓮涇一帶封鎖，査無所獲，遂折至陸家渡三一三號石灰行姜之父處，探問得姜所有之親友住所，逐家搜索，終在趙家宅泥牆圈五號姜之表妹夫奐雲祥家中，將姜拘獲。</p>
<p>同時警局獲悉王海良之住址爲泰興路同安里七三號，及往，祗遇王之母與妻，詢究無頭緒，旋至閘北談家宅十五號王之舅父江龍龍處探問，江言王曾來過，現或住在建國東路四五五弄二五號其妻小姊妹之夫楊榮林家中，楊係阪賣毒品者，警員於廿八日按址趕往，則王果在，據說來僅一小時，於是束手就擒。</p>
<p>以上情形本報均曾紀載，至陳元盛之踪跡，以其素工心計，警務人員早亦料到，偵獲必難，但經數晝夜合力研究探訪之結果，終亦成擒。據悉，偵査陳犯所到之地點，竟達十六處之多，乍浦路一一九號美泰印務局主粤人楊熾棠處，係其中之一處。陳與楊最友善，故警員對此處亦最注意。豈知陳犯狡黠異常，竟不一至。警局方面於是印就陳犯照相，大批分發各茶肆酒寮各公共塲所，令各隨時注意。旋據警員馬秉璋之友人報吿，謂照上之人極面熟，似嘗出沒於中正南二路金谷邨一帶，行動詭秘。昨晚六時許，逢派大批員警在金谷邨附近守候。至深夜十一時許，在黯淡路燈之下，果在金谷邨弄内遇見與陳相似者一人，股長馮起山返上前喝令出示身份證，其人謂證在家中，馮股長即出照片對視，則確爲陳犯。至此，陳亦謂你是馮起山否，答然。陳即曰「無話可說，是亦數也。」遂就縛帶局。陳被獲時，身穿淺藍香港衫，舊黄色長西裝褲，白皮鞋，髮已花白，蓄短髭，態度自然。據稱，逃出後，曾在社美看過電影一次，因無資力，不能遠走，每夜露宿街頭云。據一般估料，陳犯原處無期徒刑，此番或不免改判死刑也。</p>
<p>又當捕獲時，在塲警員除馮股長外，尙有巡官秦伯良，警員馬秉璋，幹警郭玉平，劉兆龍，陳光榮等，皆以破獲巨案而相互稱慶。</p>

<p>會中首審議英商上海自來水公司，由瞿鉞·邵永生·李文杰等詢問公司攤虧數字，資產負債狀况，管理費。折舊及股息等問題。經公司負責人逐一解答，大意謂：(一）攤虧數字內包括股息欠數，實際上攤虧不如賬面上龐大。（二）管理費除薪津外，尙列入若干業務費用。（三）折舊費用，因五·六月份外匯調整倍數甚大，故影響折舊。（四）股息方面，實際上公司自民國卅年起即無形停止付息，此種情形依戰前設息付息標準言，相差懸殊。英商上海自來水公司審　畢，即審議決商自來水公司，由尤巽照。姜　等詢問公司之復員費及薪津待遇等項，據答。公司復員費爲數甚微，營業情况自民卅四年起即較好轉。職工待遇去年與今年因基數提高後，故比例不同。繼即審議內地·閘北·華商等各自來水公司，對薪津，公益費，福利費，消毒費等有所詢問，會議迄六時餘始散。五次會議決定九月六日舉行，將審議各煤氣公司，上海電話公司，及公共交通公司等。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕林王，三慰，大中華三公司私營黑市金鈔及套匯嫌疑案，昨上午十時在特刑庭再度審理。開庭前王震南庭長諭稱，三公司因當初逮捕審訊，均併合一處，故數次開庭亦未分開，茲因三慰公司部份調査尙未竣事，且公司方面亦呈請傳處如慰到案偵訊，故昨日先就林王，大中華二公司，先行辯論。繼即傳大中華公司張延盛，林王公司王春哲，鄭禮恭，林同識四被告，傳訊一過。當時大中華公司會計員袁鈺生亦到庭陳述記賬情形，並請筳上將該公司與香港辦事處之往來賬目，祥細核對。</p>
<p>林王公司負責人王春哲，承認用人不當，一切罪責應由在逃之該公司代經理鄭嘉裕担負。林同識稱：十餘年來從事化學方面之硏究，故爲盛聯進出口所羅致從事經營化學原料進口之業務，並未參預林王公司之業務。鄭禮恭亦稱，薪水僅支四十元，按四月份指數實得八百四十四萬元，有賬可稽，故本人地位實非林王公司襄理。</p>

<p>旋委屛藩律師爲林同識辯護稱，社會局已有公函證明林非林王公司之合夥人，同時根據王春哲供詞筆錄，亦證明林非該公司汕頭負責人，至林同識所兼職之聯盛進出口行，內老闆係王春哲一人，故林亦有極少數款項存入該公司套取利息，有賬可稽，絕非經營黑市金鈔買賣。</p>
<p>下午一時，辯論始吿一段落。旋庭諭關於大中華公司部份，當再行調査，如無疑問，即作辯論終結，不再改期，候期宣判。至林王公司部份，昨日辯論終結，定期宣判。</p>

<p>〔本報靑浦廿九日訊〕轟動全縣之黄渡鄕婦沈龐桂英被靑龍區署拘押暴斃案，昨由蘇高院派法醫宣方來靑，於北外壇基開棺騐屍，茲誌該案詳情如下：</p>
<p>黄渡鎭第四保塘灣人沈偉之囊沈龐桂英，「廿七歲」，於上月十六日因與乃嫂徐氏細故爭吵，互至靑龍區署報請公斷，結果龐桂英被區署非法拘押，事後徐氏反悔，由保甲長等請保龐氏朱果，十七日晨龐氏突然暴斃區署中，當時區署稱渠係自縊身死，命家屬收屍，死者丈夫沈偉，在滬西曹家渡某地貨行謀生，聞此變故，趕返家中，檢親乃妻屍體，發覺龐氏陰戶浮腫，翻出如榴，小陰唇內表皮破裂，子宮道内貯滿白色液體外流，頸·腰·肋·腹，各部，均有靑色傷痕，喉間，胸部指甲痕纍纍，厥狀殊慘。當時隣里咸集，以龐氏死狀離奇，僉認可能爲强姦致死，羣情憤慨，沈偉更痛不欲生，乃向各界呼籲，並向縣司法處狀訴靑龍區長徐濟武傷害致死，於同月十九日經司法處派員，並由審判官廖斌，縣長姚鏡涵先後下鄉察勘後，於上月廿九日庭訊。據被吿區長徐濟武及涉嫌重大之常備隊分隊長羅占雲供稱：龐氏爲自縊身死，司法處派往之檢驗吏關祖懋報稱亦爲自縊。沈偉及保甲長應訊人等，將目睹實情供述後，沈偉並提出檢騐吏蘭某前往驗屍，只驗上身，不驗下體，有舞弊情形，妄斷自縊，並以死者身上脫下血汚斑斑之穢褲一條呈證，要求復驗，司法處乃電話蘇高院專派法醫來靑驗斷，以明究竟。當時出庭人員分別飭回，徐濟武等犯罪部份，由該處繼續偵査。此案發生後，輿論一致認爲區署無權濫押人民，難卸罪責，廖審判官表示：「强姦部份，靜候檢驗，即使自縊，區署亦當負妨碍自由，致人於死之法律責任。」旋省政府督導團於本月十三日蒞靑，沈偉乃將經過訴請辦理，經董團長命令縣府將罪嫌重大之分隊長羅占雲先行拘押，（羅爲省派轉業軍官）案發迄今四十餘日，週前蘇高院復電到縣派法醫宣方來靑檢驗，不意曾往驗屍之司法處檢驗更顯祖懋突於本月中旬潛逸無蹤，又承辦該案之書記官陳光冲亦於法醫到靑前數日，忽搜離職守，不知去向，（原任審判官廖斌亦於本月十八日由高院調派新任王積元接充），外界人言嘖嘖。新任王審判官表示當一本司法精神，徹究案情，務使大白，潛離員吏經報請高院免職。廿五日法醫到靑，定期廿八日命沈偉將其妻棺柩運靑相驗，各方矚目之此一大公案，乃於昨日上午十時在北門外理基開棺檢驗，一時圍觀者人山人海，龐氏住所鄉鄰，自黄渡徒步來城看驗者甚衆，開棺後臭氣四溢，令人掩鼻，屍體已吿腐爛，遂由法醫出骨驗，見者鼻酸。驗視結果：右耳根骨有傷痕一道長一寸七分，寬六分，呈深紅色，右左肱骨呈紅色，左右臂骨脾骨呈紅色，左右手指骨指尖頭呈紅色，左右肋骨廿四條左右腿骨呈紅色，左脛骨，右行骨亦呈紅色，均有傷印，結喉骨已腐化無存，下齒十六隻，内十四隻呈紅色，顯係死前曾有掙扎重壓，致有傷印如上。（陰門皮肉腐化，僅現架骨），至下午檢畢，宣法醫當日返蘇，據稱：以屍體下身各骨皆呈紅色推斷，可能假定爲自縊，但腰，肋，頭骨亦呈顯傷痕，具見死因並不簡單。檢定書於法醫返蘇後書定，案情即可分曉，據沈偉稱：渠伉　情篤，遭此不白，誓必爲乃妻伸雪會</p>

<p>— 本報記者　陳劍雄</p>
<p>〔本報嘉興廿九日訊〕在增加生產，改良農產品種，硏究農業技術的口號下之，嘉興的八字鄕因對這次推廣的新品稱六五〇六純系早秈收獲量的增加，表示十分滿意和信仰，所以在廿八日那天舉行了一個盛大的「田間展覽會」，這一個新鮮的展覽會，够醒人耳目，尤其在到處呼籲災歉的聲浪中舉行。</p>
<p>會中陳列着各種豐收的農產品，和新型的農具，舉行了一個隆重的儀式，長官們除了慰問以外，並說明政府隨時隨地在設法「增加農村生產，改善農民生活」，勸導農民注重水利，冬耕，禁止賭博，和協助政府消滅共匪，才有「好日子過」！農民聽了很興奮，鼓掌如雷。</p>
<p>六五〇六純系稻種的產量，與一般同樣施肥的土種稻比較，據農民自己說要增收每畝五斗以上，記者在田內將二種不同的早稻稻穗比較，的確使人驚異，相差之大小，簡直超出一倍以上，純系稻種的稻穗結實，每穗有二百粒以上的顆粒，土種早稻二穗也抵不過它，何怪農民極度的興奮，政府人員也莫不引爲欣慰。</p>
<p>六五〇六號稻種，他的特性是秋苗强壯，生長迅速，耐肥，本田生長期約一百〇五天，如在五月一日插秧，八月十五日可成熟，植科高度平均約三尺七寸，分糜力不强，稻桿粗大不易倒伏，葉闊，穗長平均六寸七分，通常每株小穗數在二百粒以上，穀壳淺黄，腹白適中，千粒重約廿三克，穀子折合糙米約八成，所以可以避免風水虫等災歉損害。</p>
<p>它的產量在松陽連經五年試驗，每畝平均產量在五一八斤以上，與當地土種老鼠牙比較，增產百分之十七以上，在金華試驗每畝產量五九三·二斤，較土種增產百分之廿四，在常山七三六·六斤，增產百分之廿一，這次嘉興的產量，每畝平均六〇〇斤，增產百分之廿五。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭海廿九日訊〕鎭海東管西管前緒三鄕公益堂，以創辦公益事業，復興農村，增加生產，改良風俗爲宗旨，成立以來，前後修復海塘，橋樑，道路，疏濬河道等，雖爲時未久，而成效卓著，鄉人受惠者莫不銘感，若他日棉紡生產計劃，能予以實現，前途正未可限量。</p>
<p>地方現况</p>
<p>三鄉地小人衆，生產短絀，鄉民多出外謀生，不但田地荒蕪，且遍地爲墳厝所佔據，耕地日漸縮小。戰時三鄕受創甚鉅，非短期可恢復舊觀，故外出者更衆，農村經濟愈更貧乏，因果相循，農民已臨破產邊緣，欲挽救此經濟危機惟有擴大耕地面積，設立工廠，增加生產方可充份就業，故早有計劃將鎭海招寳山至虎蹲山，虎蹲山至裏游山之兩缺口，築堤放淤，則沿萬弓塘一帶漲塗，伸漲至游山之外。沿海自招寳山，虎蹲山，游山，七里嶼向北經蟹浦，伏龍山直達餘姚之庵東（乍浦對面），全長一百八十華里，廣闊十餘里，環築海塘，二三年後最低限度可得一百五十餘萬畝之廣大平原，若加以人工蓄淡法則，不難化爲肥沃之地，將來設立農塲，輔以機械科學耕種方法，人人樂業棉花麥豆，大量生產可期，若再能逐步不斷建設，十年之後，不難成爲一新興繁榮之工農商城市，貢獻於地方國家當甚鉅大。</p>
<p>美棉試種</p>
<p>姚·慈·鎭·三縣，共試種脫字棉·德字棉廿三萬餘畝，該堂於後施自辦實騐棉塲，設立於海濱新沖積之鹹土上，開墾試種德字棉，僅三年其收獲成績已極可觀。數字如後：</p>
<p>第一年，三十斤籽棉。第二年，一百斤籽棉。第三年，一百五十斤籽棉。第四年，二百斤籽棉（預測數）。</p>
<p>餘姚原有棉田六十萬畝，慈谿鎭海二十萬畝，鎭海至庵東計劃築堤成功後，最少可增加一百五十萬畝，與原有合計，爲二百三十萬畝，至鎭海外穿山，梅山，桃花：六横及各島嶼附近漲塗，近年大量種植棉花，年收五萬担此數未列入。按照目前試種美棉成績推算：棉田總數二百三十萬畝，每畝產籽棉二百斤計，籽棉總產額四億六千萬斤或四百六十萬担。</p>
<p>增加生產</p>
<p>茲爲發揚先賢睿智，兼顧產銷配合，擬於姚·慈·鎭三縣建立紡紗廠三十所，每廠一萬綻，照最新紡機效率每綻日需棉花一磅强，就地取材，則本區總產額足供三十所紗廠全年之用，尙有富餘，至織布印染發電，機械，榨油，打包等附屬工業大小工廠在千數以上，棉花收穫後，尙可佈種一季豆麥蔬菜，其利益尙未計算入內。三鄕生產除自給外，復可供應隣省之不足，一旦本鄕工業發達，工人勢必增加，所缺食糧可以庵東之鹽交換，贛省之米互易有無，兩受其利。對內生產增加，失業减少，對外推廣紗布輸出，增加外匯收入，富國利民，有關全國經濟，豈祗三鄕受益而已哉。日本大阪並無半株棉花生產，紡織事業尙能稱雄於世，今三鄕地方地能盡其利原料俯拾即是，若能按照計劃次第實施，豈不能並駕而超越之？</p>

<p>食米繼續上漲，因其他各地價格均高，貨主心思甚堅，加之銀根鬆濫益甚，執貨者極少售意，况價格尙未到限價，進戶見低納取，去路甚爲活絡。北市薄稻二十一元六角，白粳南北二市均爲二十元零五角，各漲五六角，低檔貨升一元，至收市仍堅俏，糙秈米甚爲俏利，收市價更喊高，昨日到貨南北二市共計三五四四石。</p>
<p>麵粉轉降，謠傳棧單在三個月以上者，亦將如紗布一般充公，人心大爲恐慌，執有老棧單者，紛紛乘機售脫，供慼驟增，價乃步降，老車兵船及雜牌粉一致跌進限價，各降四角至五角。兵船粉退入七元以內，爲六元八角。紅蜂·建成一致跌入七元內。麩皮亦削五分，小麥廠盤十元零三角。</p>
<p>雜糧市勢仍堅，惟仍守住限價，交易因供應不多而轉稀，以銀根甚鬆，貨主不欲脫售也。黃豆仍按限成交，苞米有烟台帮採納，升五六角。紅糧九元原盤，元麥略有交易，市亦趨堅。蠶豆供少交稀，芝蔴貨主少脫，市堅定。生仁按限價成交甚多。</p>
<p>食油略見下挫，因禁止出口之辦法公佈，人心甚感空虛，散戶回籠吐售者甚多。豆油初市曾開五十一元，收市退爲五十元零五角，計降一元。生菜油亦挫一元，爲四十六元，吉桶生油六十三元八角限價成交，小車蔴油亦爲五十五元之限價。豆餅大致站住限價，雜牌四元五角八分。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市立江灣·虹口兩游泳池暨市體協會游泳委員會聯合主辦之本市公開游泳賽，昨午經三小時之比賽，完滿結束。全部成績，尙稱滿意。惟七項決賽，四項冠軍落入西人手中，深爲可惜，不無游泳人才寥落之嘆。男子組除跳水表演臨時取消外，各項節目，均順利舉行。女子組方面，報名參加　者原僅三人，劉天春滯留香島，未能及時趕返；龍惠霞又突染微恙，僅趙勤英一人到塲，遂上主辦當局照章宣佈，將甩有女子項目，一律取消。使滿懷勢忱，求一睹美人魚浴姿之觀衆，掃興不淺。江灣全運游泳池看台上，男女老幼，約計千餘人，尙稱熱鬧。</p>
<p>比賽較原定時間延遲廿分鐘開始，第一項千五百米自由式，中靑名將許守強始終前導，以廿八分十三秒四游畢全程，拋落第二名達七十五米。吳鼎鑑在前半段中，居第三位，第九百米時，應臂超出側泳之林祺，獲第二名。</p>
<p>五十公尺自由式爲昨賽最緊張之一項，長人徐亨與黑人却利勃脫，俱屬個中能手，分別於兩組預中輕易取得頭名。決賽之役，各傾僵務相拼，徐亨入水較遲，故前三十米勃脫領前一籌，此後徐科陸電子埋頭苦追，逐漸趕上，抵終點時幾乎難分先後，但徐亨錯估手指與池階間距離，在手指尙距終點三數寸時，即已停止劃水動作，竟被勃脫搶先觸及終點。分寸之差，鏡標拱手讓人，數百觀衆，同聲惋惜。</p>
<p>四百米自由式與一百米仰泳，許守强原有包辦希望，但以參加項目過多，氣力不繼，致俱以些微之差，屈居人下，亦屬可惜，最後水球表演賽，黑白兩隊鏖兵，黑隊藝高一籌，結果以六比四小勝。茲將男子七項決賽成績錄下：</p>
<p>項目　第一名　第二名　第三名　第四名　成績</p>
<p>五十公尺自由式　勃脫　徐亨　格里菲斯　吳華　廿八秒三</p>
<p>一百公尺自由式　勃脫　戚忻　王紅生　丁同如　一分九秒八</p>
<p>四百公尺自由式　樸納丁　許守强　陳玉泉　曾德惠　六分五十五秒</p>
<p>千五公尺自由式　許守强　吳鼎鑑　林祺　吳子芳　廿八分十三秒四</p>

<p>昨日觀衆達五六百人，半數係看客而兼游客，所以池邊滿坐浴裝人魚。比賽前報吿員竭力嘶昔，始將池中「觀衆」請出，五時許，二百米俯泳最後一人甫達終點，即聞水聲澎澎，浪花四濺，四岸觀衆紛紛入池，膽仰了三小時泳術的觀衆，都躍躍欲試了</p>
<p>五十米自由式預賽時，邱雲光因神經過份緊張，屢屢偸槍，勃脫適在此鄰，因而大受影響，不能自持，追隨入池者達二次。邱雲光被取消資格後，勃脫大起恐慌，槍聲響處，勃脫呆若木鷄，俟所有賽員供已出發後，始敢入池，但仍輕易取得決賽權。</p>

<h3 id="c156">我願意當教員 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>我曾當過一年半的小學教員，半年的中學教員，一年的民衆學校教員，幾個月的家長老師。我在大學讀的是教育系，四年級時担任本大學兼辦民衆學校教員，一天到晚，再歡談談教育的理論，吹吹教育的牛，因此同學們都呼我爲「窮敎授一，我得到了這一個頭銜，心裏也感到十分舒服得意。</p>
<p>本年暑期，我大學畢業。爲了找一個中學教員的位置，各方奔走，也跑二三十條門路，當時得到的答　都很滿意，如「我一定盡力幫忙」，「有機會通知你」，我想不成問題」等語。但直到今天，依然還沒找到一個中學教員的位置，這不但出乎我自己意料之外，就是許多同學也表示驚異；「怎麼，連你也沒有辦法？」</p>
<p>老實說，我平常在同學輩中，還不是一個十分無辦法的人，現在之所以如此出人意外，一半是由於自己大意了一點，常常覺得麼有把握似的，不大着急；一半是由於臉皮嫩了一點，不適於鑽營。我去求某人謀職，總覺得是一件難爲情的事，所以找過他一次兩次，就不再去找他了，不若那些喜鑽營者天天去可住那被請託者，機會一來，便一手抓住。</p>
<p>但我現在却並不是眞正的失業，我現在在國防部所屬的一個機關裏服務（也算是當官），待遇是不下於一個窮教員的，而乘公共汽車，電車時，可以免費或减費，可是我不愜意，我還是想當窮教員。蓋我學了四年的教育，看了數百册的教育書籍，寫過不少的粉筆字，接觸過成千上萬的靑年與兒童，現在一旦要同這些人，事，物脫離關係，我是無論如何不甘願的。</p>
<p>有一位同學勸我：「你且把目前這個工作幹着吧，何必一定要當教員？你當了教員，一輩十是個教員，有何發展！」我對於他的善意的勸吿，一點也不以爲然，難道當一輩子的教員，就是沒有發展嗎？一定要一級級地升宮，才算發展？須知一個當教員的，今年比去年教得好，便是發展；今年比去年更得學生的歡迎，便是發展，自己的道德學問長進了，便是發展；社會的風氣改良了，便是發展；國民的品性增進了，便是發展；類此種種，怎麼說沒有發展呢？再說句教育學上的術語：教育就是生長，教育就是發展。</p>
<p>因此，當一輩子的教員，以教育爲終生的事業，不僅不是件沒出息的事，根本是神聖偉大高尙的功業！</p>
<p>根據此一認識，我決心當一輩子的教員。</p>
<p>上海無我插足之地，那就「三十六計走爲上計」，我打算去台灣了。</p>

<p>談及金少山之死，妙香言：「少山逝世，報載其身後蕭條，北平譚富英等爲唱義務戲救濟之。此間天蟾在唐韻笙上台之前，由黃挂秋數人唱一齣紅鬃烈馬，所得票款，除開銷外，全部匯平，交與少山之家屬。最近有人自平來，言少山死後，雖無現款，然所藏鼻烟數瓶，可値許多億，又有烟壺，亦可値許多億，不過皆爲冷貨，不易售得善價。」</p>
<p>余友譽其羣英會之佳妙，妙香言：「羣英會以徐小香爲第一，小香約五十幾歲回蘇州，不出一來，無人敢唱此戲。一日大老板（程長庚）慫恿王楞仙（桂官）試唱之，人皆贊好，有老票友孫十爺（春山）者，言：「這不過是香灰罷了。」我未趕上徐小香，僅能揣摩王楞仙，你們稱贊我的羣英會，王楞仙唱得那麼好，尙有人譏之爲香灰，以我比徐小香，只好算脚下泥了。一以上一段話，眞是語妙天下。</p>
<p>我等吿辭時，妙香言我吊一吊嗓，遂由其子拉胡琴，妙香唱飛虎山一長段，眞是過足戲癮。今天孔子誕辰，得聽姜聖人吊嗓，不可以不記，　　，廿七，燈下）</p>

<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>二十年來，美國的醫術有突飛猛晋的進展，但是，相傳多年的一件醫界陋規迄未能够制止。這陋規就是「拆帳」——內科醫生和外科醫生之問對病人所付的開刀手術費的秘密分肥。</p>
<p>最普通的拆帳的形式是這樣的：甲醫生，一個普通的內外科醫生，對他的病人說：「我怕這是盲腸炎。我將請乙醫生來照顧你。我把我的外科病人都介紹給他。他是我所知道的最好的外科醫生。「乙醫生替病人動了手術，經過良好。</p>
<p>甲醫生向病人收取五塊錢或十塊錢的診費，乙醫生則向病人收取鉅額的手術費—譬如說一百五十塊錢。等到乙醫生收到了錢，他便分七十五元給醫生。</p>
<p>有時候則是由內科醫生向病人收取全部費用，然後再與外科醫生分拆。</p>
<p>有時拆帳以某種託辭爲掩護。最常見的一種是外科醫生於動手術時藉辭請一位內科醫生來協助，而後者的實際工作可能祗限於在一旁拿着牽引器或者麻醉劑口罩而已—這根本是一種「擺架子」的工作。有時候，外科醫生爲答謝內科醫生的介紹生意起見，便呌病人於動手術後到內科醫生處騐血壓數次—每次取費二十五元到五十元之多！</p>
<p>美國有十五州認爲醫生之間的拆帳是不合法的，違犯者要處罰鍰，監禁，或者吊銷執照，但是，執法者即使心知某醫生犯此法規，也難對之起訴，因爲這種犯法行為的證據是不易獲得的。</p>

<p>袁世凱任直隸總督時，撥公款派她籌辦天津北洋女子公學，先任總教習，後升任監督（即今之校長）。那時她只有廿一歲，是民國前八年的事。她未辦學之前，曾一度任大公報撰述。秋瑾很欽慕她，後來秋瑾出版「「國女報」，發刊詞就是出於她的手筆。</p>
<p>她好遊歷，兩度赴歐美，如美國，法國，英國，意大利，瑞士等都有她的蹤跡，尤其是住在日內瓦的時候最久。在美國，曾入哥倫比亞大學習美術。在歐洲和各國慈善家發起護生戒殺運動，同時用英文繙譯佛經，傳播佛學。她爲了信佛，實行茹素戒殺。爲了這，她在民廿四年在香港購屋居住，搬入不久，發現梁柱白蟻叢生，如果把它消滅，便遠背殺生之旨；不然，白蟻蛀爛梁柱　，屋宇傾圯，人物遭殃，不得已索性平價的把住屋讓給別人。</p>
<p>她生平的著作很多，除了中西文的論著外，詞集先後印過數次，如信芳詞，曉珠詞。她在自序裏說明自己定稿付印的原因，如云：「予慨世事艱處，家難奇劇。凡有著作，宜及身而定，隨時付梓，庶免身後湮沒。」從這幾句話，便知道她自行編印詞集的目的了。她的詞，樊雲門最爲推重，信芳詞付印時，樊氏逐首有評語，如：「南唐二主之遺，」「鬆於梅溪，細於龍洲，」「陳君衡所不能到，」「稼軒寳釵分桃葉渡，不能專美於前，」「淸深蒼秀，不减樊榭山房，」「此詞居然北宋」等，都可以見到她的詞學的造詣與成就。</p>
<p>他飽經憂患，獨身終老，平生起居服用，過的是豪華生活。後來感悟，專研內典，傳揚佛伕以終身。所遺下的只有生平著述的詩文詞，一代才人，死於亂世期問，寂寞無聞，不禁的使人感慨系之！無怪她最後的詩有「我到人問只此回」的悽音了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Coordinating the Completion of Economic Reforms: The President Orders Comprehensive Austerity, Designating Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and Li Weiguo to Draft Measures; Foreign Exchange of Firms and Banks to be Deposited in the Central Bank in the Short Term <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Following the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the President has again instructed the relevant authorities to draft comprehensive austerity measures to coordinate implementation, aiming for a two-pronged approach to rapidly achieve the intended goals and complete the current economic reform task. The President first conveyed this idea to Weng Wenhao during a meeting on the 29th and immediately designated Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and Li Weiguo to be responsible for drafting the measures. It is heard that the main principle of these measures is to implement comprehensive controls, modeled after the austerity measures of the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the Executive Yuan's Austerity Supervision Committee will also engage in promotion for the advancement of the austerity plan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian convened a meeting with the heads of various departments and bureaus on the afternoon of the 30th to discuss issues related to coordinating implementation after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The National Federation of Banking Associations, the National Federation of Native Banks, the Shanghai Native Bank Association, and the Shanghai Trust Association have jointly telegraphed the President in support of the Emergency Financial Measures.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The government hopes that all foreign exchange held by various banks, bureaus, commercial firms, and banks will be deposited in the Central Bank in the short term. Last Saturday, Premier Weng convened a symposium of leaders of commercial firms and banks in Shanghai. Following the adjournment of the meeting of the Joint Board of Directors, he immediately met with the heads of various national banks at the Premier's No. 1 residence in the Executive Yuan to explain the government's intentions. All national banks expressed their support for this. It is heard that the Central Bank has decided to convene other banks and bureaus in Shanghai within a day or two to discuss the technical issues of depositing the foreign exchange.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Deadline for Capital Increases for Firms and Banks Unchanged; Standards for Minimum Capital of Businesses Determined <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Regarding the issue of increasing capital for banks, native banks, and trust companies, in addition to the opinions expressed by leaders of the Shanghai financial community at the symposium convened by Premier Weng a few days ago, the three Shanghai industry associations for banks, native banks, and trust companies have jointly submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance requesting an extension of the "two-month deadline to reach the minimum capital" and stating that the reported minimum capital of one million gold yuan for banks in the Shanghai area is beyond the capacity of most banks. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying the opinions of the Shanghai financial community and the banking and native banking industries. Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan, and senior officials in charge within the Ministry have discussed this matter repeatedly in recent days. It is heard that the decision has been made not to change the requirement to reach the minimum capital within two months, as this is stipulated in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures promulgated by the President. Any easy change would affect the integrity of the entire plan. However, the specific amount of the minimum capital is still being drafted and has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan, so it has been decided to reconsider it. When drafting the measures in the future, the minimum capital for banks may be revised to below one million gold yuan. Furthermore, there was no meeting held by the Ministry of Finance on the morning of the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] According to the provisions of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the capital of all companies and businesses nationwide should be re-determined in terms of gold yuan, and registration of the changes should be completed within six months. In order to study the standards for calculating capital and the amount of the minimum capital, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially invited the Ministry of Finance, the Resources Commission, and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to a meeting on the morning of the 30th, presided over by Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commerce Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, to exchange opinions on the above issues. Regarding the minimum capital of companies and businesses, it has been decided that the minimum capital for companies is 1,500 gold yuan, and for businesses, it is 500 gold yuan, with each share valued at one gold yuan. As for the method of calculating capital, it has been decided not to re-evaluate assets. When converting to gold yuan, one of the following two methods will be chosen: One is to convert the company's capital at the time of establishment to the value of legal tender based on the price multiple as of August 19, 1937, and then convert it to gold yuan. The other is to convert the company's capital at the time of establishment to the value of legal tender based on the pre-war price level, and then convert it to gold yuan, with one gold yuan being equal to one or two legal tender yuan before converting to one gold yuan. A final decision has not yet been made. The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics will be asked to provide the price increase multiple from before the war to August 19 of this year as a calculation standard, and then a meeting will be held to discuss the matter. It is expected that the measures will be drafted this week and submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion next week.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Joint Board to Continue Discussions; Scope of Loan Recipients; Rumors of Four New Loans Being Approved are Inaccurate <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The Joint Treasury will hold its 371st Board of Directors meeting on the 2nd to continue discussions on the scope and recipients of loans, which were not completed last Saturday, and to discuss loan review and post-loan evaluation and other matters. The meeting was originally held once every two weeks, but this week's meeting was verbally agreed upon at last Saturday's meeting, with the aim of determining the scope and recipients of loans as soon as possible. The persons in charge of the various national banks are already in Shanghai conducting special studies on this issue.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] According to information from the Joint Treasury; Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the national banks have been instructed to suspend the issuance of new loans, and this has not yet been lifted. The Board of Directors of the Joint Treasury did not discuss loan cases on the 28th of this month. The report that the board approved four new loans is not factual.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Resumption of Stock Exchange; Authorities Have Not Yet Made a Decision <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The government has not yet made a decision on the requests from Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhixin, and others to allow the stock exchange to resume operations. According to a relevant person in charge on the 30th, there are two points worth considering regarding the resumption of stock exchange operations. One is that since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, all prices of goods and labor have been limited to the prices as of August 19. If the stock exchange resumes operations and stocks are listed, it will undermine the price limit policy. The other is that the issue of company capital increases has not yet been decided. If stocks are still listed at their legal tender face value, it seems inappropriate. Therefore, the resumption of the stock exchange will be postponed until November 21, when the use of legal tender is completely discontinued. The sale of shares in state-owned enterprises will be an opportunity for the stock exchange to resume operations. However, the government has not yet made a decision to resume operations.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Stock Exchange, visited Nanjing a few days ago to consult with the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce regarding the resumption of the stock exchange. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. He stated that the authorities believe that there is no problem in principle with the resumption of operations, but the date cannot yet be determined.</p>

<p>Legal Tender Government Bond Interest Payments Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] How to handle the legal tender government bonds and foreign currency bonds issued by the government in past years after the currency reform is a matter of great concern to the general public. According to a responsible person from the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry is carefully studying this issue. All principal and interest on various legal tender government bonds due at the end of August this year have been telegraphed by the Ministry to the Central Bank and relayed to the various managing banks to be temporarily postponed for payment, pending the implementation of the handling measures.</p>

After returning to Guangzhou, Song immediately convened meetings on food rationing and prices. Cai Fen, Huo Binshu, and others were invited to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e10">First Meeting of the Second Session of the Legislative Yuan; Discussing Amendments to the Organic Law; Draft General Principles for Provincial and County Self-Government Will Also Be Submitted as Soon as Possible <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The Procedural Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the morning of the 30th and decided to hold the first meeting of the second session on September 7. After Speaker Sun delivers a speech announcing the formal resumption of the session, the items listed on the agenda will be carried out. A resumption ceremony will not be held separately beforehand. The seating arrangement for the members for this session will be determined by drawing lots during registration. It is reported that the agenda for the first meeting, in addition to reporting items, will focus on issues related to amending the Organic Law and Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan and will be submitted for discussion as soon as possible. The main points of these issues are approximately as follows: (1) Amend Article 5 of the Organic Law regarding the method of selecting the convening members of each committee. The provisional method for the first session was to determine the conveners by drawing lots among the Zhi Gu (Senior Advisor) members. The results of the trial implementation showed that the efficiency of the proceedings was significantly affected. It is planned to change it back to the committee members electing each other in this session. (2) Amend Article 8 of the Organic Law. The original provision was that motions submitted by members of the Legislative Yuan should first be submitted to the Yuan (Legislative Yuan) for discussion. In fact, broad discussions in the Yuan during the initial stage are time-consuming. It is planned to amend this so that all motions should be submitted for review first. (3) Amend Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure. The original provision was to hold regular meetings twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays. The experience of the first session showed that many believed this was too frequent. It is planned to amend this to hold regular meetings once a week. If there are too many motions, meetings can be held for several consecutive days.</p>

The draft will be submitted for discussion as soon as possible during the second session. Once it is adopted, the comprehensive completion of our country's constitutional work can be realized soon.</p>

<h3 id="e27">How to Plug the Loopholes of Price Controls? <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency system, the general response has been very positive, and commodity prices have been particularly stable. This is certainly due to the efforts of local authorities and the sincere support of the general public. With such mutual support from above and below, and persistent effort, we can confidently believe that the success of the new currency can indeed be grasped.</p>
<p>Regarding the stabilization of commodity prices, there are indeed some minor loopholes. Although these loopholes do not currently affect the overall situation, a single spark can start a prairie fire. To prevent problems before they arise and to promptly remedy them, we must point out the facts to call public attention.</p>
<p>First, commodity prices in Changsha have generally risen. Compared to the benchmark of August 19th, they have already increased by 70%, with the highest exceeding more than double. However, the local authorities have taken no action to date. At first glance, this seems to be a local issue, perhaps insignificant, but in reality, the fluctuations in commodity prices in different regions are interconnected. It is truly a case of "when the copper mountain collapses in the west, the bell in Luoyang answers in the east," no matter how insensitive one may be. The main reason for the failure of price controls in a few cities in the past was precisely this. Taking rice prices as an example, Shanghai implemented price controls, but the producing areas failed to proceed simultaneously, so it had to be abandoned to avoid blocking the source. If the price of rice is like this, how can the prices of other commodities be any different? Therefore, if this system of price control is to be maintained without failing, it must be promoted comprehensively to be effective.</p>
<p>Second, it is said that although price controls on tung oil have been strictly enforced in this city, the Transportation Control Committee, to avoid price increases and competitive purchasing, has stipulated a price of two jiao per pound. However, a certain producing area, using various excuses, has allowed the price to rise, far exceeding the market price of August 19th. As the ancients said, "Move one hair and the whole body is affected." It is obvious whether this exception will affect the remaining commodity prices and the prices in other ports.</p>
<p>Third, as far as Shanghai is concerned, many goods still come from bandit-controlled areas, such as pigs, which mostly come from northern Jiangsu. Needless to say, they will not implement price controls simultaneously. In the areas close to the bandit-controlled areas, it is said that there are also many taxes and temporary expenses under various names, not only without any restrictions, but also adjusted at any time, which will naturally affect the cost and the price control. It is indeed extremely difficult to solve this difficulty in practice, but in order to maintain the supply and price control in this city, we have to find ways to overcome it.</p>
<p>Fourth, many shops and vendors, in order to avoid selling at the controlled price, often close early or supply inferior goods. This is a common occurrence in the vegetable market. The purchase price is too high, and they are unwilling to lose money, so they may have their own unavoidable difficulties. However, it must be known that this widespread implementation of price control is not due to a temporary expedient measure by local officials, but due to the established national policy of the central government, which cannot be perfunctorily dealt with temporarily. Therefore, those in the industry should work together to suppress the purchase price to seek legal survival, and should not procrastinate and look forward to leniency. Our suggestion is not only for the benefit of consumers, nor only for stabilizing commodity prices and supporting the currency system, but also for maintaining their business.</p>
<p>Fifth, according to a Chengdu dispatch, due to the city government's forced resumption of business and strict implementation of price controls, the stores' inventory was mostly snapped up by citizens, and price-controlled goods were almost nowhere to be found, causing prices to rise again. This reflects several things: the wholesale market price does not seem to have been controlled simultaneously, otherwise, with goods coming in and going out, price-controlled goods would never disappear; this is one. Stores using pretexts to refuse sales is not a good way to deal with the situation, because the more they refuse to sell, the easier it is to cause the public to compete to buy; this is two. The implementation of price controls, in addition to using political power, must also take into account economic principles, that is, the maintenance of reproduction and the unblocking of sources; this is three. Since the currency system reform order was announced, the number of supplementary decrees issued by various ministries and commissions has been quite large, but most of them still focus on strengthening control and restoring pre-war bottom lines. As for the development of production and the promotion of industry, aside from the convenience of official documents and the occasional mention of one or two sentences, no facilities have been seen. This is really a disappointing thing. Looking at the story of the price-controlled goods in Chengdu being snapped up, it should be understood that economic problems can never be solved solely by political means.</p>
<p>Sixth, supplementary measures for consolidating public finances have been announced. Many of the new tax rates and fees set therein are adjusted according to wartime standards. There seem to be quite a few others that are still under discussion according to this standard. Whether this standard is appropriate to restore completely at present is another question. However, the current price control level is not entirely consistent with the pre-war level. If the current price has already been raised, and then taxed according to the pre-war standard, whether this will affect the cost and whether it is consistent with the authorities' policy of maintaining price control is worth noting. It is said that the cigarette industry will raise the commodity tax to the pre-war standard. The cost is high, and it is difficult to maintain the price control of August 19th. Representatives have been sent to Beijing to seek consideration. This is an example. In particular, the treatment of public and teaching staff is much lower than before the war, but they still have to shoulder the same burden as before the war. Whether this is fair in terms of reason and emotion cannot be ignored. We also know that balancing the budget is one of the main conditions for consolidating the new currency system, but the importance of maintaining price control is definitely not lower than balancing the budget. If price control is broken through, I am afraid that there is no appropriate way to remedy it. Therefore, we believe that any income that is sufficient to increase the cost of goods should be temporarily postponed, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>In short, stabilizing commodity prices is the most important task at present, and everyone should be anxious about what is urgent and move towards this goal together. The government has the responsibility of supervising and promoting, and should especially address both the symptoms and the root causes, and remove all obstacles to facilitate the implementation of the gold yuan. As for all measures that are sufficient to stimulate commodity prices and affect the value of the currency, on the part of the people, the competent authorities in various places should resolutely crack down and correct them at any time. On the part of the government itself, it should set an example and try its best to avoid them to increase people's confidence.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's Baoding dispatch on the 30th] Since the currency reform, the authorities have only stipulated prices for major daily necessities.

Tian remained silent, saying that he had not received the verdict from the Criminal Court. The Land Court did not immediately publish the reasons for the verdict in the Han case due to insufficient manpower. Han Wenhuan, while serving as the Chief of Police of the Capital Police Department, asked himself to be innocent. Therefore, every time the Land Court summoned him, he appeared in court for questioning in accordance with the law to show his spirit of respecting national laws. Han's new position was rumored to be the chief of public security in a certain province. He could have gone to take up the new position, but he did not make the trip because he was waiting for the Land Court's acquittal. After this verdict is announced, if the prosecutor does not appeal within the statutory period, he can go to take up the new position.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 30th, Moscow broadcast: The Kremlin meeting continued for another two hours and ten minutes, ending at 7:10 PM. Molotov and Vyshinsky both participated in the meeting. According to US Ambassador Smith: No communiqué was issued on the evening of the 30th, and talks will continue. It was previously reported that a communiqué would be issued after this meeting, but since the issuance has been delayed, it is generally believed that difficulties must have arisen in the consultation regarding the drafting of the communiqué.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 30th] Envoys from the three Western powers went to the Kremlin at 2:00 PM today (standard time, 11:00 PM Shanghai savings time) for the eighth meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It is generally believed that a communiqué regarding the negotiations will be released late in the evening on the 30th. US Ambassador Smith, British Envoy Roberts, and French Ambassador Chataigneau held a brief consultation at the French Embassy before going to the Kremlin, and they undoubtedly fully agreed on the detailed plan for issuing the communiqué. Premier Stalin will not attend the meeting on the 30th. It is generally believed that the talks will focus almost entirely on the planning work for the communiqué, which is expected to announce that an agreement has been reached on the unification of the Berlin currency and the effective lifting of the Berlin ground blockade by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 30th, Berlin broadcast: The Berlin City Council voted on the 30th to postpone the meeting until the four powers issue a communiqué on the Kremlin negotiations and the Soviet Union agrees to provide police protection.

<h3 id="e51">Former French Premier Marie Resigns After Recognizing the Difficulty; Schumann Appointed to Form New Cabinet; Currently Consulting with Leaders of Various Parties <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, August 30] President Auriol today requested former Premier and financial expert Schumann to come forward and form a new cabinet. Auriol's move came after Marie declined to serve as Premier. The President received Marie's letter of refusal at midnight yesterday and immediately summoned Schumann, instructing him that since both the extreme left and the extreme right factions want to seize power, swift action must be taken. Observers believe that the resignation of the Marie cabinet has created the most serious political crisis in France since the war, with both the Communist Party and de Gaulle's right-wing faction vying for power.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, August 30] Former Premier Schumann of the Popular Republican Movement accepted the President's request this morning and is now accelerating efforts to form a cabinet in order to gain sufficient strength of majority support in the National Assembly to form a coalition cabinet. Schumann belongs to the Popular Republican Movement and served as Premier from November 22, 1947, until July 19 of this year, when he resigned due to a vote of no confidence in the Assembly. Marie served as Premier before Schumann.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, August 30] Commentaries in Parisian newspapers unanimously believe that Schumann will face many difficulties in forming a cabinet. Commentaries in all newspapers unanimously agree that the establishment of a financial and economic plan acceptable to all parties will remain an obstacle to Schumann forming a new cabinet. The conservative newspaper "Parisien Libéré," close to de Gaulle, stated in its editorial that Schumann will encounter the same difficulties as his predecessor, and that he must first find an economic program acceptable to his cabinet members, and then find personnel to implement this program. The newspaper is pessimistic about Schumann's chances of success, concluding that if Schumann fails to form a cabinet, there is only one person who can save the situation, and that is the President of the National Assembly, Herriot. The conservative "France Soir" predicts Schumann's great difficulty in forming a cabinet, stating that even if Schumann obtains the support of the majority to form a new cabinet, he will encounter serious difficulties in the allocation of cabinet positions, in addition to the issue of the economic recovery plan. The task of solving this problem is truly of greater importance than all other problems.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th] The "Sunday Observer" here reports that when Franco met with Don Juan, who is seeking to inherit the Spanish throne, on a yacht near San Sebastian on the 25th, he offered the Spanish throne to the latter's eldest son. This secret meeting was planned at the suggestion of the US State Department.

According to the newspaper, Franco expressed his willingness to recognize Don Juan's eldest son, Carlos, as the heir to the Spanish throne, on the condition that Don Juan himself renounce his own claim. However, Don Juan has not yet given a definite answer, as he needs to consult with his advisors.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Main Cause of Malayan Insurgency Lies in British Breach of Promise; British Once Promised Overseas Chinese Full Rights <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 30th] A left-leaning editorial in the "Far East Bulletin" recently stated that the direct cause of the current Malayan insurgency lies in Britain's refusal to abide by its promise of constitutional reforms. The article specifically accuses the new constitution of the Malayan Union of placing Chinese residents in a "politically neglected position," while the number of overseas Chinese and Chinese residents "accounts for almost half of the entire population of Malaya and Singapore."</p>
<p>The article continued, stating that the British Labor government, in cabinet statements and white papers after the war, revealed political systems in Malaya with "progressive and improved characteristics." These statements stated that the British government had decided to: (1) abolish the privileges of the Malayan rulers; (2) establish a Malayan Union based on democratic principles; and (3) grant citizenship rights to all residents of Malaya, regardless of ethnicity. "The last provision would allow approximately 2.7 million Chinese to enjoy full political rights in the autonomous federation allowed by Britain." However, "when then Governor General Gurney appointed a constitutional organization on July 26, 1946, he went against the above-mentioned policies. This constitutional organization included five official representatives, four representatives of local rulers, and two representatives of the Malayan Ex-Services League."</p>

<p>Commentary by British Correspondent in Tokyo</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] British Conservative "Sunday Observer" correspondent in Tokyo, Trassey, today wrote an article criticizing US policy toward Japan, stating: The purpose of American policy is no longer to establish democracy in Japan, but to increase Japan's economic strength as quickly as possible to reduce the burden on American taxpayers, and to use Japan as an American strategic base in the event of a war against the Soviet Union. American policy has gradually lost the trust of various allied nations. Under the guise of security, the United States is working to support reactionary politics and industry, and is hostile to those who are more popular with the people. And most intolerable is that the pre-war Japanese secret thought police have gradually revived under the guise of the communist threat.</p>

<p>In this era of turbulent changes, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who has reigned for fifty years, is now about to retire, and her daughter, Princess Juliana, will take over.</p>
<p>There are two reasons that will make Queen Wilhelmina as famous in history as the great queens of all dynasties. The first is that the beginning of her reign and the length of her reign are similar to that of the great Queen Victoria of England; second, the splendor of her political achievements and her decisive judgment during her reign can be compared to another famous Queen Elizabeth of England. Therefore, it is very reasonable to guess that the Queen is modeling herself after Queen Elizabeth. When the Queen was just twenty years old and talking about marriage, she said, "Can't I govern myself like Queen Elizabeth of England?"</p>
<p>But despite all this, the Queen finally married the person she chose and had an heir, and like Queen Elizabeth, she governed the country to prosperity, so that future historians will name the period from 1898 to 1948 as the "Wilhelmina Era".</p>
<p>The Queen was born on August 31, 1880. When her father, King William III, died in 1891, the Queen was only eleven years old. At such a young age, she became the head of a country, and her mother acted as regent.</p>
<p>At that time, Wilhelmina was the formal Queen, but she was still a childish and playful girl, and she would sometimes play small jokes at social gatherings. Her mother wisely allowed her to be as happy as possible. When the young Queen was in danger of violating etiquette, her mother was always able to cleverly find a way to eliminate it. The young Queen's natural and childish behavior made the public feel fond of her. In the spring of 1895, the Queen visited England, when the youngest Queen of Europe, Wilhelmina, and the oldest Queen, Victoria, met together. Before 1889, when she traveled to various countries, she always tried as much as possible not to be with adults, but to play with those of similar age.</p>
<p>This trip was really the recreation she needed in addition to her education. The courses she studied were very extensive, including world history, Dutch history, geography, German literature, English and French, cosmology, the Dutch East Indies government, art history, religion, military knowledge, etc. In addition, there were also guidance and practice for future royal affairs, allowing her to participate in official banquets, and later to hold salon dances herself. She also often had the opportunity to deal with various political disputes.</p>
<p>On August 30, 1898, Empress Emma officially retired, and the Queen took office the next day and issued her wishes to the people and her first announcement. In her speech on that day, the Queen said, "I will follow the example of my mother and will follow it for the rest of my life, as I, Princess of the House of Orange, should govern. I will be loyal to our constitution. In the name and flag of our Netherlands, I sincerely say that I am willing to maintain the rule of law in our homeland and in the eastern and western colonies, and I will do my best to seek spiritual and material welfare for these places."</p>
<p>The Queen and her husband had met in Kempten, France, in the year her father died. Since then, there has been no break in their contact. After the Queen and her mother visited the Earl and Countess of Oberg-Schönburg, followed by a visit to Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, everything was decided. On October 16 of that year, the engagement of Queen Wilhelmina and Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was formally announced. On March 5, 1901, the young Queen politically fulfilled her wish, as she said, "I only marry the person I love."</p>
<p>Eight years later, the Queen gave birth to Princess Juliana, and the fears of many years that the Queen had no children and that the House of Orange would end were dispelled. In the eyes of the Dutch people, the birth of Princess Juliana Louise Emma Maria Wilhelmina was a major event in 1909.</p>
<p>During the First World War, the Queen's firm attitude made a deep impression on domestic and foreign public opinion. During these difficult four years, the Netherlands remained neutral throughout, which is an example of its economic and military steadfastness, autonomy, judgment, and independent attitude. Even in the most difficult circumstances, the Netherlands was not drawn into the vortex of world war as Belgium had been. During these four years, she constantly inspired her people, urged them to unite, instructed them to endure the burdens God gave them, and gave them encouragement in times of danger and seriousness. In the end, the people did not disappoint the Queen's expectations, and this serious catastrophe was finally overcome.</p>
<p>Her reign was not an easy thing. She had to overcome economic difficulties, promote national prosperity, and resist military aggression, especially in the last ten years, which were very difficult. When she was nearly sixty years old, Hitler's Nazi army invaded the Netherlands without a declaration of war, and the Queen resolutely ordered the national army and civilians to resist. Although the strength of the two sides was very different, the Netherlands was temporarily occupied by the German army, but the Queen retreated to Britain until the last minute, and would not succumb to the Nazi iron heel. Her courage and perseverance made her even more popular.</p>
<p>During her five years of exile in Britain, the Queen continued to plan and direct the underground workers in the country, making efforts against the Nazis and waiting for her return to her homeland. The people of the country also forever placed their hopes and freedom on the Queen. During this period, she really endured all kinds of hardships, but her wish was finally realized at the end of the war. As soon as the Allied forces entered the Netherlands, she returned to her homeland and began to promote the reconstruction work of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Queen's performance during the darkest era in Dutch history was so brilliant that she became one of the greatest rulers in Dutch history. The Queen is now sixty-eight years old, and she has been worried about national affairs for fifty years. This great heroine is really exhausted and needs a chance to rest. Therefore, it has been decided to hand over the arduous reconstruction work that she has already begun to her daughter, Princess Juliana, to continue and complete.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Chiang Ching-kuo Sternly Instructs Various Sectors: The Government Is Determined to Stabilize the Economy With a Do-or-Die Resolve; Advises Merchants Not to Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a discussion meeting with responsible individuals from various commercial trade associations in the city. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor for the Shanghai District, also attended by invitation to explain the government's policies on price controls and currency reform. Over three hundred responsible individuals from eighty-one commercial trade associations in the city attended, including those from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, hardware, southern goods, northern goods, rice, grains, edible oil, bran, wine and dishes, yarn, cotton cloth, silk fabric, general merchandise, rubber, silk merchants, kerosene, leather, hotels, new medicines, traditional Chinese medicines, and silverware. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau began by reporting, stating briefly: "The government has issued an emergency decree on financial and economic matters, reformed the currency system, and stabilized prices. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor for the Shanghai District, will report to you on the government's measures for this new policy, and we also hope to hear your opinions for reference." Wu also encouraged the merchants to assist the government in implementing the policies, and especially hoped that the responsible individuals of each trade association would convey to their members to comply unanimously. After Wu finished speaking, Supervisor Chiang reported, stating: "The new economic policy has been promulgated this time to reform the currency system and stabilize prices, with the aim of eliminating the phenomenon of prices rising daily, the cost of living increasing monthly, the amount of legal tender increasing daily, and the economic crisis becoming increasingly serious. The significance of this matter is equivalent to suppressing bandits on the front lines, because the government's two major tasks at present are to suppress the military rebellion on one hand and stabilize the economy on the other, to safeguard the people's livelihood. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. For a week, the people of the whole country have been paying close attention to the movements of the Shanghai market. Fortunately, the business community in this city has been able to understand the government's measures and unanimously assist the government in implementing the policies. Although there have been very small fluctuations in prices, they are generally stable."</p>
<p>The Three Committees Each Have Their Own Tasks</p>
<p>Chiang also said: "This price control policy is nationwide, starting with stabilizing the market. We will thoroughly control prices and strictly enforce the prices of August 19th, without allowing any changes. To remedy the actual difficulties of various industries, the following steps will be implemented: (1) Establish a Materials Supply Committee to specifically supply materials to the city's market, including industrial raw materials, so as not to cause supply and demand problems. (2) Establish a Price Review Committee to implement the pricing of August 19th, striving to reduce prices, but still seeking a reasonable price so that retailers and wholesalers can obtain legitimate profits. (3) The Economic Inspection Committee is responsible for inspecting warehouses, strictly prohibiting hoarding and speculation." Chiang continued: "Merchants are of varying quality. Recently, when inspecting warehouses, we found cotton yarn and cotton cloth that had been stored since after the victory, almost three years ago." He clearly stated: "In the future, any cotton yarn and cotton cloth stored for more than three months will be confiscated. This is not to make things difficult for merchants, but to enforce orders. As for the difficulties of legitimate merchants, we will definitely provide legal and reasonable solutions, but for illegal merchants, we will resolutely disregard all personal feelings and severely punish them." In short, he hoped to achieve: the government supplies materials as much as possible, prices are reviewed reasonably, and hoarding is strictly inspected. Chiang sincerely hoped that the Shanghai business community would assist and advised all merchants not to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The government is determined to implement the new economic policy with a do-or-die resolve and will thoroughly implement it, hoping to seek stability for the entire country and its people. Chiang pointed out that some rice merchants in the city sell rice for household rations that include broken rice, and the prices of new and traditional Chinese medicines lack standards, which not only violates commercial ethics but should also be condemned by conscience.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Researching and Printing Price Booklets: People Can Purchase Goods at the Specified Prices; Business Owners Will Be Arrested for Violations; Severe Punishment for Inspection Fraud <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Chiang hoped that the Shanghai business community would establish a good atmosphere to serve as a model for the national commerce. He also planned to research with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to print price lists for various daily necessities so that people could purchase at the specified prices, thereby stabilizing people's minds. Chiang finally hoped that various industries would provide opinions.</p>
<p>At this point, Director Wu specifically put forward two points of hope: (1) All stores should uniformly mark the prices of goods, (2) Sales should uniformly issue receipts. Subsequently, responsible individuals from the wine and dish industry, Western food industry, firewood industry, cotton cloth industry, wine and sauce industry, yarn business, kerosene retail industry, milk industry, southern goods industry, and fresh pork industry trade associations expressed their opinions, the main points being: (1) Efforts should be made to channel idle funds into legitimate avenues to avoid the rush to purchase goods. (2) Differentiate prices for retailers and wholesalers in various industries. (3) Assist with transportation. Afterwards, Chiang made a final conclusion: Regarding the issue of idle funds, a concrete method will be implemented soon to provide a home for idle funds. Generally, prices cannot exceed those of August 19th, but it must be done legally, reasonably, and with consideration. Chiang also pointed out: Recently, he had learned that some stores even hired personnel specifically responsible for taking legal action, but in the future, if any business commits illegal acts, the owner will be arrested. He paid close attention to the conduct of inspection personnel, and if any acts of fraud or corruption are discovered, they will be severely punished once discovered. He believed that if government personnel can connect with the people as one and communicate from top to bottom, the new economic policy will surely be implemented smoothly, and prices will surely be stabilized.</p>

<p>In order to thoroughly implement the suppression of prices, crack down on unscrupulous merchants, and implement new economic measures, Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor of the Shanghai District, especially visited the Municipal Police Bureau at 8:30 AM yesterday to give instructions to all police officers. Over five hundred people attended, including the heads and deputy heads of various branch bureaus, staff of the Economic Inspection Brigade, and other units. Chiang first elaborated on the importance of economic inspection work, stating briefly: "If we want to make the suppression of the rebellion successful, the front line is certainly important, but the economic problems in the rear cannot be neglected. The two must be coordinated in order to achieve success. Therefore, economic inspection work is of great importance to the overall situation, so we must thoroughly implement economic inspection work." Chiang believed that personnel performing this great and arduous work must achieve "no favoritism, clean themselves," and be impartial and serious in order to complete their mission. Chiang then compared the relationship between the police and the people to that of fish and water. The police are like fish, and the people are like water. The police cannot be separated from the people, and the people should also assist the police. Chiang finally hoped that all police officers would cooperate closely with the monetary control authorities so that the economy of the city can be stabilized, and the people's lives can be secured. Mr. Chiang finished speaking and left at around 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Chiang Ching-kuo recently issued a handwritten order to the Sixth Team of the National Defense Ministry's Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade, which had just been transferred to Shanghai from Tangshan, to dispatch one company quickly to station in Wuxi in order to coordinate and strengthen the implementation of the emergency decree on financial affairs in the Beijing-Shanghai area, and to strike at the unscrupulous merchants concentrated there. The company has now left Shanghai for Wuxi yesterday morning under the command of Company Commander Li Shoujun. According to Mr. Li speaking to a reporter: after they arrive in Wuxi, they will also establish several people's service stations to encourage the people to report, and thoroughly eliminate unscrupulous merchants, bandits, and corrupt officials. In the future, in addition to contacting the Wuxi military and political organs, they will also maintain close contact with Beijing and Shanghai, and will continue to listen to the instructions of the Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday was the second day that the People's Service Stations of the Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade began work. The citizens of each district went to submit confidential letters with great enthusiasm. The opening of a portion of the confidential report boxes at noon resulted in more than one hundred letters, but most of them were reporting retailers raising prices, with very few revealing those who were speculating and hoarding. Chiang Ching-kuo went to the Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade to look over these letters and instructed that minor cases be sent to the Economic Police Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau for handling, while major cases be sent to the office of the Economic Supervisor. Because the confidential report boxes are distributed across a vast area, the second opening time each day is still at midnight. The staff of the Rebellion Suppression and Construction Brigade, in addition to investigating based on confidential letters, are not responsible for enforcement. However, starting today, the team will dispatch another fifty team members to cooperate with the economic police to assist in inspection work.</p>
<p>Also, in order to encourage people to submit confidential reports, in addition to the confidential report boxes set up at the people's service stations in each district accepting letters from citizens as usual, citizens who do not wish to reveal their identity by submitting letters can send confidential reports with accusations or suggestions directly to "Shanghai Shen Zi No. 7009 Post Office Box".</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the police bureau uncovered a total of eleven cases of various business establishments exceeding the price limits: (1) The Yingfa pharmacy at No. 87 Yunnan Road was selling Kefa white pine sugar at a marked price of 7 million yuan per bottle. Cui Dechang, an employee of the Tianzhang Department Store on Fujian Road, discovered that the Zhengweihua pharmacy was selling it for only 4.5 million yuan per bottle, and reported it to the Laoza Police Branch. After an investigation was conducted, the person in charge of the pharmacy was detained and transferred to the General Bureau for investigation. (2) The Jinxiangfu fashion shop at No. 22 Nanjing West Road changed the price of a raincoat from the old price of 54 million legal tender to 19.5 Gold Yuan. (3) The Yakai silk and cloth store at No. 68 on the same road increased the selling price of Hong Kong hemp cloth. (4) The Jinmen store at No. 80 Zhou Road was selling fleece at a price exceeding the limit. (5) The Tianlong Company at No. 246 on the same road was selling ribbon for 17.1 million yuan per yard, up from the previous price of 15 million yuan. In addition, the Xinli shoe company, Lida shoe company, Buyun shoe store, and Xinle Department Store in the Jingu Commercial Market, as well as the Shengji Commercial Firm at No. 304 Zhengzheng North Road and the Luolan store on the same road, were all found to have exceeded the price limits. The people in charge of each business were taken to the bureau by the police for questioning and will be punished according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Social Affairs Bureau's Price Review Meeting Reduced Interest Rates for Pawnshops, and Ordered Various Industries to Comply With Price Limits <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau continued to convene various industries in the city to hold a price review meeting: (1) For the pawnshop industry, the original interest rate was as high as 5 to 8 jiao per month, and there were so-called warehouse rent fees and handling fees. Section Chief Zhang of the Social Affairs Bureau instructed that the interest rate should be reduced after the currency reform, and ordered it to be reduced to 2.1 jiao per month. The warehouse rent and handling fees remained the same, and they would be ordered to reduce them month by month in the future. (2) For the sauce and wine industry, there are about 2,000 members of this industry in the city. In the past, prices were set freely, so the prices on August 19th varied from store to store. The Social Affairs Bureau instructed that they should first sell at the prices set by each store on August 19th and not exceed the limit. As for unified prices, another meeting will be held within the next few days to discuss them. (3) For the stationery industry, the pencil manufacturer increased the price on August 18th, but the store front did not change the code on August 19th. If the store front sells at the old price, the retail price will be too low. After the Social Affairs Bureau decided, the pencil front sale will still be at the August 19th price, and the factory price will be at the August 8th price. (4) For Chinese and foreign mixed cloth merchants, in the past, retailers were used to paying with checks when purchasing cloth from the factory, so the price was higher. Retail sales were all in cash, so the price was lower. If the retail price is lower than the wholesale price according to the August 19th price, after the currency reform, all wholesale sales will require cash. If the retail price is not increased, there will be a loss. The Social Affairs Bureau still rigidly stipulates that the August 19th price limit should be followed. If there are any problems, they will be resolved later. (5) For the theater industry, some Yue Opera or Shanghai Opera theaters adjusted ticket prices after the cost-of-living index was released on August 15th, while others did not adjust them in time. For example, the Nine Stars Theater only increased the price after August 19th, and requested permission to add the increase. The Social Affairs Bureau feared that opening this example would have a great impact, so it instructed them to strictly abide by the August 19th price limit and not exceed it. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau scheduled a meeting with theater industry leaders on September 2nd, and will invite representatives from the police and finance bureaus to participate at that time.</p>

<p>Some citizens sent confidential letters to the Social Affairs Bureau, reporting that many famous Chinese and Western doctors in the city increased the gold yuan equivalent of the registration fee for outpatient visits after the currency reform, without following the August 19th price list, and requested that this be stopped. The Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to thoroughly investigate separately.</p>

<p>The Supervisory Yuan previously sent two Supervisory Committee members, Sun Yulin and Tang Honglie, to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate some special figures who engaged in securities speculation after learning of the currency reform in advance. The two have been working actively in Shanghai for several days and have gained a lot. Yesterday, Supervisory Committee Member Sun told reporters that although a lot of information has been obtained on this case so far, the investigation work still needs to be carried out. After the investigation work comes to an end, before colleagues return to Nanjing to report, they will definitely announce the truth about this case.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Yu Peihou, Ni Bi, and Qing Shen'an, the members of the Supervisory Committee Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang District, which will be established tomorrow, also attach great importance to this case and have decided to dispatch personnel from the Office to investigate within the next few days, so that the truth of this case can be revealed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e79">All Three Escapees From Shanghai Prison Captured: Chen Yuansheng Escaped For Six Days But Could Not Escape Death <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Chen Yuansheng, a major criminal sentenced to life imprisonment in the Central Bank gold brick theft case, and two other thieves, Jiang Jixiang and Wang Hailiang, escaped from the fifth floor of Shanghai Prison in the morning of the 24th of this month during a heavy rainstorm. After the prison break, the security authorities sent out detectives in all directions, and finally announced that all of them had been captured by 11 p.m. last night.</p>
<p>After this case occurred, the Police Bureau first interrogated Liu Aliuyi, a thief who was in the same prison but did not escape, and carefully studied the evidence left behind, such as the hacksaw blade and cotton yarn belt. Liu confessed that he had heard Chen and Jiang discussing their escape plan, preparing to go to Baiyun Jing and take Jiang's uncle's own wooden boat to Jurong. Police officers rushed to Pudong and blockaded the Bailian Jing area, but found nothing. They then went to Jiang's father's lime shop at No. 313 Lujia Ferry and inquired about the residences of Jiang's relatives and friends, searching each one. Finally, they captured Jiang at Huan Yunxiang's house, Jiang's cousin-in-law, at No. 5 Niqiangquan, Zhao Jiazhai.</p>
<p>At the same time, the police bureau learned that Wang Hailiang's address was No. 73 Tongan Lane, Taixing Road, and went there, only encountering Wang's mother and wife. After questioning, they had no clue. Then they went to Jiang Longlong, Wang's uncle, at No. 15 Tan Jiazhai, Zhabei, to inquire. Jiang said that Wang had been there, and now he may be living in Yang Ronglin's house, the husband of his wife's younger sister, at No. 25, Lane 455, Jianguo East Road. Yang is a drug dealer. Police officers rushed to the address on the 28th and found Wang there. It is said that he had only arrived an hour earlier, so he was caught without resistance.</p>
<p>The above situation has been recorded in our newspaper. As for Chen Yuansheng's whereabouts, because he is usually scheming, police officers had long expected that it would be difficult to detect him, but after several days and nights of joint research and visits, he was finally captured. It is reported that the locations visited by Chen reached as many as sixteen. The Meitai Printing Bureau at No. 119 Zhapu Road, owned by Yang Chichang, a Cantonese, is one of them. Chen and Yang are very friendly, so police officers paid the most attention to this place. However, Chen was unusually cunning and did not go there even once. The police bureau then printed a photo of Chen and distributed it in large quantities to various teahouses, wine shops, and public places, ordering everyone to pay attention at any time. Soon, a friend of police officer Ma Bingzhang reported that the person in the photo looked very familiar and seemed to frequent the Jingu Village area on Zhengzheng South Second Road, and his actions were secretive. Around 6 p.m. last night, a large number of police officers were dispatched to wait near Jingu Village. At around 11 p.m. late at night, under the dim street lights, they encountered a person similar to Chen in Jingu Village Lane. Section Chief Feng Qishan returned and ordered him to show his ID card. The man said that the card was at home. Section Chief Feng immediately took out the photo for comparison, and it was indeed Chen. At this point, Chen also said, "Are you Feng Qishan?" He answered yes. Chen immediately said, "There is nothing to say, it is also destiny." So he was bound and taken to the bureau. When Chen was captured, he was wearing a light blue Hong Kong shirt, old yellow long suit pants, and white leather shoes. His hair was already gray, and he had a short beard, with a natural attitude. According to reports, after escaping, he had seen a movie once in Shemei. Because he had no money, he could not go far and slept on the streets every night. According to general estimates, Chen was originally sentenced to life imprisonment, and this time he may inevitably be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>In addition to Section Chief Feng, patrol officer Qin Boliang, police officer Ma Bingzhang, police officer Guo Yuping, Liu Zhaolong, and Chen Guangrong were also at the scene when he was captured, and they congratulated each other for solving the major case.</p>

<p>The seventh general assembly of the first session of the Municipal Council has been decided by Chairman Pan to convene on September 9th. The Secretariat of the General Assembly notified the Municipal Government yesterday to expedite the re-compilation of the budget for the 37th year and submit it to the relevant groups for preliminary review. The detailed agenda of the conference is being compiled by the secretariat of the council and will be announced within the next few days. It is reported that the conference was originally scheduled to be held in early October. The advance of the conference should be due to the need to address certain temporary problems arising after the currency reform. It is widely believed that the issue of rent standards is closely related to local tax revenue and must be resolved quickly, which will be the focus of discussion in this session of the conference. The tuition standards for public and private primary and secondary schools in the current semester, which were announced a few days ago, far exceed the central government's regulations, and will also cause expected fierce debate. However, the issue of public utility prices will be uniformly formulated by the Executive Yuan after the currency reform, and the competent authorities can stay out of this session of the conference.</p>

Method 5 should be revised to "It is proposed that the government pay attention to factory equipment to avoid disasters."</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The literary writer Zhang Aiqing sued the famous writer Yao Fengzi for borrowing the manuscript of "Seeking Dreams in Studying" for a long time without returning it. The District Court opened a court session a few days ago. The defendant confessed to borrowing the plaintiff's manuscript, but he did not find where to find it at the moment, so he was late to return it. There was no intention of fraud or embezzlement. After both parties were willing to settle outside the court, the court adjourned the trial to another date.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Public Utility Investigation Committee: Reviews the Waterworks Section; Various Companies Answered Depreciation and Other Issues <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Public Utility Price Public Investigation and Review Committee held its fourth meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 4:30 PM yesterday. In addition to the various committee members present, Laurent from the French Water and Electricity Company, Locke from the British Water Company, Zhao Wenxiang from the Mainland Water Company, and Cheng Xu from the Pudong Water Plant were also present. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting and first explained that the purpose of this meeting was to review the waterworks section and asked the various committee members to express their opinions.</p>
<p>The British Shanghai Waterworks Company was first reviewed. Qu Yue, Shao Yongsheng, Li Wenjie and others inquired about the company's amortization loss figures, asset and liability status, management fees, depreciation, and dividends. The person in charge of the company answered one by one, with the general meaning: (1) The amortization loss figure includes the number of dividends owed, and the actual amortization loss is not as large as it appears on the books. (2) Management fees include some operating expenses in addition to salaries. (3) Depreciation expenses were affected by the large exchange rate adjustment in May and June. (4) In terms of dividends, the company has actually stopped paying dividends invisibly since the 30th year of the Republic of China. This situation is very different from the pre-war standard of setting interest rates and paying interest. After the British Shanghai Waterworks Company's review was completed, the commercial waterworks company was reviewed. You Xun zhao, Jiang, and others inquired about the company's restoration costs and salary benefits, and the company replied that the company's restoration costs were very small and that its business situation has been better since the 34th year of the Republic of China. The salary benefits of employees last year and this year are different because the base has been raised. Then, the Mainland, Zhabei, and Chinese Waterworks Companies were reviewed, and inquiries were made about salaries, public welfare expenses, welfare expenses, and disinfection fees. The meeting did not break up until after 6 p.m. It was decided that the fifth meeting will be held on September 6 to review the various gas companies, Shanghai Telephone Company, and public transportation companies.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The police bureau's economic police brigade cracked a black market gold trading case yesterday, seizing four large gold bars on the spot. The suspect, Tang Jiye, was arrested and interrogated and will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for legal proceedings today. Tang is a well-known gold speculator, and his usual business contact address is supposedly inside the Dahua Company at 149 Sichuan Road. The police bureau learned of this three days ago and immediately dispatched officers to investigate. Yesterday morning, team leader Lou Chenghan disguised himself as a customer and negotiated to purchase ten gold bars, at a black market price of 2,020 Gold Yuan per bar, agreeing to complete the transaction at 4:00 PM in room 348 of the Oriental Hotel. When Tang arrived carrying only four gold bars, the police officers already stationed in the room saw that the time was right, revealed their identities, and arrested him.</p>
<p>In addition, three Chinese and foreign gold black market offenders, Wei Boxiang, Mei Ji, and Ai Qier, who were recently arrested by the brigade, have been detained and investigated, and the case is nearing completion. It is expected that they will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court today after the confession records and investigation reports are organized.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Three Companies' Currency Exchange Case; Two Companies' Arguments Concluded; Investigation of Sanwei's Portion to be Handled Separately <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of suspected private operation of black market gold and currency exchange involving Lin Wang, Sanwei, and Dahua companies was heard again at the Special Criminal Court at 10:00 AM yesterday. Before the hearing, Presiding Judge Wang Zhennan stated that because the three companies were arrested and interrogated together initially, the hearings had not been separated. As the investigation into Sanwei Company's portion has not yet been completed, and the company has requested that Ru Wei be summoned for questioning, the arguments would proceed for Lin Wang and Dahua companies first. Zhang Yansheng of Dahua Company, and Wang Chunzhe, Zheng Ligong, and Lin Tongshi of Lin Wang Company were then summoned as defendants and questioned. At that time, Yuan Yusheng, an accountant from Dahua Company, also appeared in court to explain the accounting situation and requested that the company's accounts with the Hong Kong office be carefully verified in court.</p>
<p>Wang Chunzhe, the person in charge of Lin Wang Company, admitted to hiring the wrong person and stated that all responsibility should be borne by Zheng Jiayu, the company's deputy manager, who is currently at large. Lin Tongshi stated that he has been engaged in chemical research for more than ten years, so he was recruited by Shenglian Import and Export to engage in the import of chemical raw materials and did not participate in the business of Lin Wang Company. Zheng Ligong also stated that his salary was only 40 yuan, which was actually 8.44 million yuan according to the April index, as can be seen from the accounts, so his position was not actually the assistant manager of Lin Wang Company.</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM, the court ordered the start of the arguments. Ji Hemen, the lawyer for Zhang Yansheng, requested that the court summon the accountant from Dahua Company's Hong Kong office and a Nanyang film merchant to testify in court. Du Kaoxiang, the defense lawyer for Wang Chunzhe, argued on behalf of the defendant that all of Lin Wang Company's vouchers were signed by the manager, Zheng Jiayu, and Wang should not be responsible for Zheng's personal actions.</p>
<p>Lawyer Wei Pingfan, appointed to defend Lin Tongshi, stated that the Social Bureau had already issued an official letter proving that Lin was not a partner of Lin Wang Company. Also, according to Wang Chunzhe's confession record, it was proved that Lin was not the person in charge of the company's Shantou branch. Lin Tongshi also worked part-time for Liansheng Import and Export, whose real boss was Wang Chunzhe, so Lin also deposited a small number of funds into the company to earn interest, as can be seen from the accounts, and he was definitely not engaged in black market gold trading.</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the arguments concluded. The court then ordered that the Dahua Company's portion be investigated further, and if there were no doubts, the arguments would be concluded without rescheduling, and a verdict would be issued at a later date. The arguments for Lin Wang Company's portion concluded yesterday, and a date was set for the verdict.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yi Feng Jin Rice Shop, located at 119 Nanhui Street, Penglai District, was reported for suspected malpractice in rice distribution. After receiving the report, the People's Food Allocation Committee approved the request from Section Chief Cai of the committee's management section to Director Lu of the allocation office to suspend rice distribution as a penalty. The shop was previously reported by nearby residents for allegedly obtaining a large number of rice ration coupons through illegal means and then reselling the rice obtained from the People's Food Allocation Committee for profit. After investigation by Zhao Bingwen, chairman of the district people's representative assembly, more than 300 completely new blank rice ration coupons were found in the shop's cash register drawer. These coupons did not have the district, bao, or jia households written on them and were all serially numbered, indicating that they were not owned by residents but were obtained from the agency responsible for issuing the rice ration coupons. The district people's representatives then invited Si Pu, a commissioner from the People's Food Allocation Committee stationed in Penglai District, to conduct an inspection on the spot. Commissioner Si then confirmed that the shop had also illegally sold household rice past the deadline. The People's Food Allocation Committee stipulated that the distribution date should end on the 25th of each month and that extensions should not be granted without special reasons and approval. The shop continued to sell rice after the 26th without permission, violating the committee's regulations and showing suspicion of malpractice. Commissioner Si then reported the situation to the People's Food Allocation Committee. When the reporter visited Section Chief Cai of the committee's management section yesterday, he said that he had already signed a request to Director Lu yesterday to suspend the shop's distribution of household rice starting from this period as a penalty.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tian Yongchou, director of the Finance Bureau, returned to Shanghai by train on the night of the 29th, having gone to the central government in Beijing to consult on the city's financial problems. Yesterday, he reported to reporters on his trip to Beijing, saying that the central government's recently promulgated supplementary measures for reorganizing finances did not mention local finances. He went to Beijing to consult on tax rates and other issues. Minister Wang informed him that they were still being drafted, and there would be no major changes to the tax rates, but there would be slight changes to the penalty rules. Local governments would have the authority to adjust tax rates.</p>
<p>The city government is unable to bear the employees' salaries for the second half of August, and the central government does not intend to provide subsidies. The Finance Bureau is very concerned about this and has decided to borrow the shortfall from the Central Bank in advance, and the funds will be distributed to employees within two or three days.</p>

<p>According to reliable sources: Director Tian has formally submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu. Director Tian has repeatedly requested to resign due to the city's extreme financial difficulties, but his requests have not been approved. This is his fifth resignation request. He believes that the city's finances may improve slightly after the currency reform, so he intends to take the opportunity to retire.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Case of Sudden Death of Woman in Huangdu Township; Coffin Opened for Autopsy; Officials Flee <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Qingpu, 29th] The case of Shen Pang Guiying, a woman from Huangdu Township, who died suddenly while detained by the Qinglong District Office, has caused a sensation throughout the county. Yesterday, a forensic doctor, Xuan Fang, was dispatched from the Jiangsu High Court to Qingpu to open the coffin and conduct an autopsy at the cemetery outside the North Altar. Details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Shen Pang Guiying, "27 years old," wife of Shen Wei, a resident of Tangwan, Fourth Bao, Huangdu Town, had an argument with her sister-in-law, surnamed Xu, on the 16th of last month over a trivial matter. Both went to the Qinglong District Office to request a ruling. As a result, Pang Guiying was illegally detained by the District Office. Afterward, Xu regretted her actions, and the Baojia chief and others guaranteed Pang's release. On the morning of the 17th, Pang suddenly died in the District Office. At the time, the District Office claimed that she had hanged herself and ordered her family to collect the body. Shen Wei, the deceased's husband, was working at a cargo company in Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Upon hearing of the incident, he rushed home and examined his wife's body. He discovered that Pang's vulva was swollen and everted like a pomegranate, the inner skin of the labia minora was ruptured, and the uterine canal was filled with a white fluid that was flowing out. There were blue bruises on her neck, waist, ribs, and abdomen, and numerous fingernail marks on her throat and chest. The situation was extremely tragic. At that time, the neighbors gathered, and because of the bizarre circumstances of Pang's death, everyone believed that she may have been raped to death. The public was indignant, and Shen Wei was in extreme grief. He appealed to all sectors and filed a complaint with the county's judicial office, accusing Xu Jiwu, the Qinglong District Chief, of causing death by injury. On the 19th of the same month, the judicial office dispatched personnel, and Judge Liao Bin and County Chief Yao Jinghan went to the township to investigate. On the 29th of last month, a court hearing was held. According to the statements of the accused District Chief Xu Jiwu and Luo Zhanyun, the squad leader of the standing team, who was heavily suspected, Pang hanged herself. Guan Zumao, the judicial office's coroner, also reported that it was a suicide. Shen Wei and the Baojia chiefs and other people who testified gave their accounts of what they had seen. Shen Wei also presented a pair of soiled pants stained with blood, which had been removed from the deceased's body, as evidence, and requested a re-examination, pointing out that the coroner, Lan, who had examined the body only examined the upper body and not the lower body, which was a sign of malpractice, and wrongly determined that it was a suicide. The judicial office then telephoned the Jiangsu High Court to dispatch a forensic doctor to Qingpu for an examination to determine the truth. The personnel appearing in court at the time were ordered to return separately, and the criminal portion of Xu Jiwu and others was to be investigated further by the office. After this case occurred, public opinion unanimously believed that the District Office had no right to illegally detain people and could not escape responsibility. Judge Liao stated, "The rape portion will be determined pending examination. Even if it was a suicide, the District Office should be held legally responsible for obstructing freedom and causing death." Later, the Provincial Government Supervision Group came to Qingpu on the 13th of this month. Shen Wei told them about the incident and requested that it be handled. Group Leader Dong ordered the county government to detain squad leader Luo Zhanyun, who was highly suspected of committing the crime (Luo was a retired military officer dispatched by the province). More than 40 days have passed since the incident. A week ago, the Jiangsu High Court telegraphed the county to dispatch forensic doctor Xuan Fang to Qingpu for examination. Unexpectedly, Guan Zumao, the judicial office's coroner who had previously examined the body, suddenly fled without a trace in the middle of this month. Furthermore, Chen Guangchong, the clerk handling the case, also suddenly left his post a few days before the forensic doctor arrived in Qingpu, and his whereabouts are unknown (Liao Bin, the original judge, was transferred by the High Court on the 18th of this month, and Wang Jiyuan was appointed to replace him). People outside were talking about it. The new Judge Wang stated that he would uphold the spirit of the judiciary and thoroughly investigate the case to make the truth clear. The Provincial High Court has been asked to dismiss the fleeing officials. On the 25th, the forensic doctor arrived in Qingpu and scheduled Shen Wei to transport his wife's coffin to Qingpu on the 28th for examination. This major case, which had attracted attention from all sides, was opened and examined at the cemetery outside the North Gate at 10:00 AM yesterday. For a time, the onlookers were a sea of people. Many neighbors from Pang's residence in Huangdu walked to the city to watch the examination. After the coffin was opened, a foul odor filled the air, causing people to cover their noses. The corpse had already decomposed. The forensic doctor then removed the bones for examination, which caused those who saw it to feel sad. Examination results: There was a 1.7-inch long, 0.6-inch wide, deep red wound on the root bone of the right ear; the right and left humerus were red; the right and left arm bones and spleen bone were red; the fingertips of the right and left hand bones were red; the right and left 24 ribs and leg bones were red; the left tibia and right tibia were also red, all with traces of injury. The hyoid bone had rotted away, and 14 of the 16 lower teeth were red, indicating that there had been struggle and heavy pressure before death, resulting in the above-mentioned injuries. (The skin and flesh of the vulva had rotted away, leaving only the skeletal frame). The examination was completed in the afternoon. Forensic doctor Xuan returned to Suzhou that day. According to him, based on the fact that the bones of the lower body were red, it could be presumed that it was a suicide, but the waist, ribs, and skull also showed obvious signs of injury, indicating that the cause of death was not simple. The examination report will be written after the forensic doctor returns to Suzhou, and the facts of the case will then become clear. According to Shen Wei, he and his wife were deeply in love, and he swore that he would seek justice for his wife who had suffered such a wrong.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nantong, 28th] Zhu Jingming, the town chief of Shigang Town in this county, recently came up with a bizarre idea and secretly sent his subordinate, Bao Chief Geng Bin, and others, carrying guns, to the Liuyuan Township area, disguised as bandit soldiers, to carry out robberies.

Later, the leader of the Shigang Volunteer Patrol Team mediated, and the weapons were returned.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Zhenjiang, 29th] The case of Dr. Gao Enpei killing Han Qing, the director of the Zhongzhou Barber Shop, with a needle, which caused a sensation throughout the province, has been investigated by Section Chief Shi of the Health Department. The major case of reckless disregard for human life was finally not pursued. The deceased's wife, Ren Weishi, is destitute and has two children and is also pregnant. She is extremely pessimistic about her future life, so she filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Gao of negligent homicide. The District Prosecutor's Office opened a special investigation court on the 28th. After the arguments, the court ordered that the witnesses had not arrived, and scheduled a continuation of the hearing. In addition to paying a cash bail of 10,000 yuan, the accused, Gao Enpei, also provided a shop as a guarantor.</p>

<p>— Our Correspondent Chen Jianxiong</p>
<p>[Our Jiaxing dispatch, 29th] Under the slogan of increasing production, improving crop varieties, and researching agricultural technology, the Bazixiang area of Jiaxing expressed great satisfaction and confidence in the increased yield of the newly promoted 6506 purebred early indica rice. Therefore, on the 28th, a grand "Field Exhibition" was held. This novel exhibition was truly eye-opening, especially as it was held amidst calls for disaster relief everywhere.</p>
<p>Various bountiful agricultural products and new types of agricultural tools were displayed at the meeting. A solemn ceremony was held. In addition to offering condolences, the officials explained that the government was constantly trying to "increase rural production and improve the lives of farmers," urging farmers to focus on water conservancy, winter plowing, and prohibiting gambling, and assisting the government in eliminating the communist bandits, only then could they have "good days to live!" The farmers were very excited and applauded thunderously.</p>
<p>According to the farmers themselves, the yield of the 6506 purebred rice seeds, compared with the local rice varieties with the same fertilization, increased by more than five dou per mu. The reporter compared the two different early rice ears in the field, and it was indeed surprising. The difference in size was more than double. The purebred rice ears were solid, with more than two hundred grains per ear. Two ears of local early rice could not match it. No wonder the farmers were extremely excited, and the government officials were all gratified.</p>
<p>The 6506 rice variety is characterized by strong seedlings in autumn, rapid growth, and tolerance to fertilizer. The growth period in the paddy field is about 105 days. If the seedlings are transplanted on May 1st, they can mature on August 15th. The average height of the plants is about 3 feet 7 inches. The tillering ability is not strong, the rice stalks are thick and not easy to lodge, the leaves are broad, and the average length of the ears is 6 inches 7 minutes. Usually, each plant has more than 200 spikelets. The grain husks are light yellow, the ventral white is moderate, and the thousand-grain weight is about 23 grams. The grain conversion to brown rice is about 80%, so it can avoid damage from wind, water, and insect pests.</p>
<p>Its yield has been tested in Songyang for five consecutive years, with an average yield of more than 518 jin per mu, an increase of more than 17% compared with the local old rat tooth variety. In Jinhua, the yield per mu was 593.2 jin, an increase of 24% compared with the local variety. In Changshan, it was 736.6 jin, an increase of 21%. This time, the yield in Jiaxing averaged 600 jin per mu, an increase of 25%.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Prospects for Cotton Textile Production in Three Townships of Zhenhai <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[Our Zhenhai dispatch, 29th] The Gongyitang of Dongguan, Xiguan, and Qianxu Townships in Zhenhai, with the aim of establishing public welfare undertakings, revitalizing the countryside, increasing production, and improving customs, has repaired seawalls, bridges, roads, dredged rivers, etc. since its establishment. Although it has not been long, the results have been remarkable. The villagers who have benefited are all grateful. If the cotton textile production plan can be realized in the future, the future is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Current Local Situation</p>
<p>The three townships have a small area and a large population, and production is insufficient. Many villagers go out to make a living, not only is the land barren, but it is also occupied by graves everywhere, and the cultivated land is shrinking day by day. During the war, the three townships suffered greatly, and it will not be possible to restore the old appearance in the short term. Therefore, even more people go out, and the rural economy becomes even poorer. As a result, farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy. To save this economic crisis, it is necessary to expand the cultivated land area, establish factories, and increase production to provide sufficient employment. Therefore, there has long been a plan to build dikes and silt up the two gaps from Zhaobao Mountain to Hutun Mountain and from Hutun Mountain to Liyou Mountain in Zhenhai, so that the area along the Wanggongtang will be filled with silt, extending beyond You Mountain. Along the coast from Zhaobao Mountain, Hutun Mountain, You Mountain, and Qiliyu to the north through Xiepu, Wolong Mountain, and directly to Andong (opposite Zhapu) in Yuyao, the total length is 180 li and the width is more than 10 li. By building seawalls around it, at least 1.5 million mu of vast plains can be obtained in two or three years. If artificial freshwater storage methods are added, it will not be difficult to turn it into fertile land. In the future, establishing farms and using mechanical and scientific farming methods, everyone can happily work, and large-scale production of cotton, wheat, and beans can be expected. If construction can be gradually and continuously carried out, in ten years, it will not be difficult to become a new and prosperous industrial, agricultural, and commercial city, making a great contribution to the local area and the country.</p>
<p>American Cotton Trial Planting</p>
<p>Yao, Ci, and Zhen counties have jointly trial-planted 230,000 mu of Tuozi cotton and Dezi cotton. The Gongyitang has established a self-operated experimental cotton field on the newly alluviated saline soil on the coast, and has been trial-planting Dezi cotton. In just three years, the harvest results have been very impressive. The figures are as follows:</p>
<p>First year: 30 jin of seed cotton. Second year: 100 jin of seed cotton. Third year: 150 jin of seed cotton. Fourth year: 200 jin of seed cotton (estimated).</p>
<p>Yuyao originally had 600,000 mu of cotton fields, and Cixi and Zhenhai had 200,000 mu. After the planned dike construction from Zhenhai to Andong is successful, at least 1.5 million mu can be added, totaling 2.3 million mu. In addition, a large amount of cotton has been planted in recent years in the siltation near Chuanshan, Meishan, Taohua, Liuheng, and various islands outside Zhenhai, with an annual harvest of 50,000 dan, which is not included in this number. According to the current trial planting results of American cotton, the total number of cotton fields is 2.3 million mu, and the yield of seed cotton per mu is 200 jin, the total output of seed cotton is 460 million jin or 4.6 million dan.</p>
<p>Increase Production</p>
<p>In order to promote the wisdom of the sages and take into account the coordination of production and sales, it is planned to establish 30 spinning mills in Yao, Ci, and Zhen counties, each with 10,000 spindles. According to the efficiency of the latest spinning machines, each spindle requires more than one pound of cotton per day. By using local materials, the total output of this area is sufficient for the annual use of 30 spinning mills, with a surplus. There are more than a thousand large and small factories for weaving, printing, dyeing, power generation, machinery, oil extraction, and packaging, as well as affiliated industries. After the cotton harvest, one season of beans, wheat, and vegetables can be planted, and the benefits of this have not been calculated. In addition to self-sufficiency, the production of the three townships can also supply the needs of neighboring provinces. Once the industry in this township is developed, the number of workers will inevitably increase. The lack of food can be exchanged for salt from Andong, and rice from Jiangxi can be exchanged to supply what is needed, benefiting both sides. Internally, production is increased and unemployment is reduced. Externally, the export of yarn and cloth is promoted, increasing foreign exchange income. Enriching the country and benefiting the people is related to the national economy, and it is not just the three townships that benefit. Osaka, Japan, does not produce half a cotton plant, but its textile industry can still dominate the world. Now, the land in the three townships can be fully utilized, and the raw materials are readily available. If it can be implemented step by step according to the plan, can it not keep pace with and surpass it?</p>

<p>The price of rice continues to rise, because the prices in other places are high, the cargo owners are very firm, and the money supply is very loose. There are very few sellers. Moreover, the price has not yet reached the price limit. Buyers are taking advantage of the low prices, and the sales are very active. The price of early rice in Beishi is 21.6 yuan, and the price of white japonica rice in both the north and south cities is 20.05 yuan, each rising 5 or 6 jiao. The price of low-grade rice has risen by 1 yuan, and the market is still bullish at the close. Coarse indica rice is very popular, and the closing price is even higher. Yesterday, a total of 3,544 shi arrived in the north and south cities.</p>
<p>The price of flour has turned down. It is rumored that warehouse receipts for more than three months will be confiscated like yarn and cloth, and people are very panicked. Those who hold old warehouse receipts are taking the opportunity to sell them, and the supply has increased sharply. The price has fallen. Old Chebing ship and miscellaneous brand flour have all fallen to the price limit, each falling 4 to 5 jiao. Bing ship flour has fallen below 7 yuan, to 6.8 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng have all fallen below 7 yuan. Wheat bran has also been reduced by 5 fen, and wheat mills are trading at 10.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market is still firm, but it is still holding the price limit. Transactions are becoming rare due to the lack of supply. Because the money supply is very loose, cargo owners do not want to sell. Soybeans are still traded at the price limit. Corn is being purchased by the Yantai gang, rising 5 to 6 jiao. Red sorghum is trading at 9 yuan, and naked barley has a few transactions, and the market is also trending firm. Broad beans are in short supply and transactions are rare. Cargo owners are reluctant to sell sesame seeds, and the market is firm. Raw peanuts are traded at the price limit.</p>
<p>The price of edible oil has declined slightly, because the ban on exports has been announced, and people feel very empty. Many retail investors are returning to the market to sell. The initial price of soybean oil was 51 yuan, and the closing price fell to 50.05 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan. Rapeseed oil also fell by 1 yuan to 46 yuan. Jilong raw oil is traded at the price limit of 63.8 yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil is also at the price limit of 55 yuan. Soybean cake is generally holding the price limit, and miscellaneous brands are at 4.58 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the trend of the foreign tea market has repeatedly shown signs of improvement. Green tea has benefited greatly from the government's announcement of currency system reform and the redefinition of foreign exchange, which has greatly benefited exports. Unfortunately, the current inventory of various goods is limited, and the production price has been rising all the way. Therefore, transactions have not been active, but the price can be said to be stable. According to general opinion, the foreign tea market is not in danger. As for domestic sales of fancy tea, although the holders are firm in selling, the stores in this street feel that the inventory is still abundant, and the authorities are strictly controlling prices these days, so they are not eager to purchase more. The process is characterized by little buying or selling, and a quiet bullishness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was sluggish. Because it was reported that yarn and cloth were banned from being transported to the south, people became skeptical. Although the bulls wanted to devalue and sell, there was a lack of buyers. The Textile Construction Company continued to sell in the market, with 10-count Red Fortune priced at 478 yuan, 16-count Fairy priced at 578 yuan, and 20-count Five Sons and Golden Double Chicken priced at 645 yuan each, for a total of four types.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was initially weak due to the news of the ban on transportation to the south and the investigation of warehouses. However, due to the loose money supply, new buyers were secretly absorbing goods. Xianghan and Changjiang gangs were very strong in their demand for autumn sales of colored cloth and Yuan Bizhi, and the price rose to the limit. However, the brokers in the market strictly followed the authorities' advice and stopped calling out prices when they reached the limit. Therefore, after 10 o'clock, the market was closed. The initial price of Longtou fine cloth was squeezed by a small triangle, and the noon closing price was 29.5 yuan, which had reached the limit. Other cloths were similar.</p>

<p>Refused Entry, They Reside Under the Corridors</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] Over two thousand middle school students from Shanxi Province who are temporarily residing in the Temple of Heaven, more than six hundred of them, entered the Taimiao (Imperial Ancestral Temple) yesterday. It is claimed that this was due to being unable to endure the rain and mosquito bites. The management authorities, fearing the loss of cultural relics, books, and documents within the temple, refused to open the doors. The students spent last night residing under the corridors of the various halls. The Taimiao has been closed to tourists, and local authorities have repeatedly advised them to move out, but due to the lack of suitable housing, there has been no effect. The students also know that breaking into the temple would carry too much responsibility, and the situation remains at a standstill. The students claim that several of them fall ill and are taken to the hospital every day, and they only have four steamed buns a day to fill their stomachs. Furthermore, the Shanxi Provincial Government has requested that the Ministry of Education establish a temporary middle school in Beiping, and they have come to Beiping via Nanjing.

<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Saigon, 29th] Jinan University in Shanghai recently sent Professor Liu Xianwei to Saigon to recruit overseas Chinese students. This is the first time a domestic university has sent a representative to Nanyang to recruit overseas Chinese students. The local Chinese community warmly welcomes Mr. Liu. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Saigon hosted a tea reception this morning, and various difficulties encountered by overseas Chinese students returning to China for education were discussed during the meeting. There are three main points: (1) Most overseas Chinese high school graduates who wish to return to China for further education have no relatives or friends in the country. The Chinese community believes that special organizations should be established in major cities in China to receive overseas Chinese students and inform them of the necessary knowledge for their continued education. (2) Overseas Chinese high school graduates are generally less proficient than domestic students. To encourage them to return to China to study, domestic universities should reserve a quota for overseas Chinese first-year students who are exempted from entrance examinations. If examinations are required, the admission standards should also be set separately. Even if they do not pass the examination, remedial classes should be set up to accommodate them. (3) Due to domestic inflation and difficult student living conditions, and some universities lack adequate facilities, all overseas Chinese hope that the current currency reform will be successful. The government should provide all possible conveniences for remittances for those with children studying in China.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Public Swimming Competition - Chinese and Western Athletes - Fierce Competition - Xu Heng Loses 50-Meter Race to Burt - Westerners Grab Four of Seven Championships <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Open Swimming Competition, jointly organized by the Jiangwan and Hongkou Municipal Swimming Pools and the Swimming Committee of the Municipal Sports Association, concluded successfully yesterday afternoon after three hours of competition. The overall results were satisfactory. However, it is a pity that four of the seven finals were won by Westerners, prompting concerns about the lack of swimming talent. Except for the temporary cancellation of the diving performance in the men's group, all events proceeded smoothly. On the women's side, only three participants originally registered. Liu Tianchun was stranded in Hong Kong and could not return in time, and Long Huixia suddenly fell slightly ill. Only Zhao Qinying arrived at the venue, so the organizers announced in accordance with the regulations that all women's events would be canceled. This greatly disappointed the audience who were hoping to see the "mermaid" in action. The stands of the Jiangwan National Games Swimming Pool were quite lively with approximately one thousand men, women, and children.</p>
<p>The competition started twenty minutes later than originally scheduled. In the first event, the 1500-meter freestyle, Xu Shouqiang, a well-known middle-aged athlete, led from start to finish, completing the course in 28 minutes and 13.4 seconds, leaving the second-place finisher 75 meters behind. Wu Dingjian was in third place in the first half, surpassing Lin Qi in the sidestroke at 900 meters to take second place.</p>
<p>The 50-meter freestyle was one of the most intense events of the competition. The tall Xu Heng and the black athlete Kelly Burt are both experts in this event and easily took first place in their respective preliminary groups. In the final, they both gave it their all. Xu Heng was slower to enter the water, so Burt was ahead by a margin for the first 30 meters. Xu then buried his head and chased hard, gradually catching up. It was almost impossible to tell who was ahead when they reached the finish line. However, Xu Heng misjudged the distance between his fingers and the edge of the pool. When his fingers were still a few inches from the finish line, he stopped stroking, allowing Burt to touch the finish line first. The difference of an inch caused the championship to be handed over, to the regret of hundreds of spectators.</p>
<p>Xu Shouqiang originally hoped to win both the 400-meter freestyle and the 100-meter backstroke, but due to participating in too many events, he lacked the strength and narrowly missed out on both, which was also a pity. In the final water polo exhibition match, the black and white teams fought fiercely, with the black team being slightly better and winning 6-4. The results of the seven men's finals are recorded below:</p>
<p>Event First Place Second Place Third Place Fourth Place Time</p>
<p>50-meter Freestyle Burt Xu Heng Griffiths Wu Hua 28.3 seconds</p>
<p>100-meter Freestyle Burt Qi Xin Wang Hongsheng Ding Tongru 1 minute 9.8 seconds</p>
<p>400-meter Freestyle Parkerding Xu Shouqiang Chen Yuquan Zeng Dehui 6 minutes 55 seconds</p>
<p>1500-meter Freestyle Xu Shouqiang Wu Dingjian Lin Qi Wu Zifang 28 minutes 13.4 seconds</p>
<p>100-meter Backstroke Sterling Xu Shouqiang Sun Guang'er Chen Yuntai 1 minute 16 seconds</p>
<p>200-meter Breaststroke Zhang Jia Sun Guangyi Zhong Shoujun Zhu Genbao 3 minutes 16.9 seconds</p>
<p>150-meter Individual Medley Zhuo Zongyi Wu Dingjian Zhong Shoujun Wu Hua 2 minutes 29.7 seconds</p>

<p>Yesterday, the audience reached five or six hundred people, half of whom were spectators and tourists, so the poolside was full of bathers. Before the competition, the announcer tried his best to shout and get the "spectators" out of the pool. At around 5:00 PM, just as the last person in the 200-meter breaststroke reached the finish line, splashes could be heard, and the audience on all sides entered the pool. The audience, who had admired swimming skills for three hours, were eager to try it themselves.</p>
<p>During the 50-meter freestyle preliminary, Qiu Yunguang repeatedly false started due to excessive nervousness. Burt happened to be next to him, and was greatly affected, following him into the pool twice. After Qiu Yunguang was disqualified, Burt was very panicked. When the starting gun went off, Burt remained frozen, and only dared to enter the pool after all the other competitors had already started. However, he still easily qualified for the final.</p>
<p>The giant of the Chinese Youth team, Xu Shouqiang, participated in three events: the 1500-meter and 400-meter freestyle, and the 100-meter backstroke. He was busy with registration, drawing lots, competing, and receiving awards.</p>
<p>The daughter of Director Li of the Education Bureau, Ms. Yuehua, is familiar with Zhejiang swimming and attends and presents awards at every competition. Yesterday, after arriving at the pool, she asked the ticket collector to pay attention to anyone entering the venue with a certain ticket number, and detain them and send them to the police for investigation. It turned out that after Ms. Li attended the Liangjiang Open Competition the day before, her purse was snatched by a cyclist near Tongren Road. The purse contained several complimentary tickets for yesterday's competition. Ms. Li hoped to use this clue to catch the thief, but the thief did not take the bait.</p>
<p>Someone discovered that all the top four medals for yesterday's competition were the same as those awarded in the Hongkou Swimming Competition. The organizers explained that they were leftover materials from the previous competition. (Quan Quan)</p>

<h3 id="e156">I Want to Be a Teacher <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>I have been an elementary school teacher for one and a half years, a middle school teacher for half a year, a public school teacher for one year, and a tutor for several months. I studied education in university. In my fourth year, I served as a teacher at the public school run by the university. All day long, I would talk about educational theories and boast about education, so my classmates called me "Poor Professor." I felt very comfortable and proud to receive this title.</p>
<p>This summer, I graduated from university. In order to find a middle school teaching position, I ran around and took many routes, twenty or thirty, but the answers I received were very satisfactory, such as "I will definitely do my best to help," "I will let you know if there is an opportunity," and "I think it will be no problem." But until today, I still haven't found a middle school teaching position. This is not only beyond my own expectations, but many classmates are also surprised: "How come even you can't do it?"</p>
<p>To be honest, I am usually not a very helpless person among my classmates. The reason why I am so unexpectedly unsuccessful now is partly because I was a little careless, often feeling like I was not sure, and not very anxious; and partly because I am a little thin-skinned and not suitable for ingratiating myself. When I go to ask someone for a job, I always feel embarrassed, so after looking for him once or twice, I don't go to him anymore, unlike those who like to ingratiate themselves and go to the person they are asking every day, seizing the opportunity when it comes.</p>
<p>But I am not truly unemployed now. I am currently serving in an organization affiliated with the Ministry of National Defense (you could say I am an official), and the salary is no less than that of a poor teacher. And I can ride public buses and trams for free or at a reduced fare, but I am not satisfied. I still want to be a poor teacher. I have studied education for four years, read hundreds of books on education, written a lot of chalk characters, and come into contact with thousands of young people and children. Now that I have to break away from these people, things, and matters, I am unwilling no matter what.</p>
<p>One classmate advised me: "Why don't you just keep doing your current job? Why do you have to be a teacher? If you become a teacher, you'll be a teacher for life. What kind of development is that!" I don't agree with his well-intentioned advice at all. Is it that there is no development in being a teacher for life? Do you have to rise through the ranks to be considered development? You should know that a teacher who teaches better this year than last year is developing; a teacher who is more popular with students this year than last year is developing; a teacher who improves their own morality and knowledge is developing; a society where the atmosphere improves is developing; a nation where the character improves is developing; how can you say there is no development in all of this? To use a term from education: education is growth, education is development.</p>
<p>Therefore, being a teacher for life, taking education as a lifelong career, is not only not an unambitious thing, but a sacred, great, and noble undertaking!</p>
<p>Based on this understanding, I am determined to be a teacher for life.</p>
<p>If Shanghai has no place for me, then "the best of the thirty-six stratagems is to leave," and I plan to go to Taiwan.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Old Mountain Villa <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>The Zhao family of Old Mountain Villa are a great book-collecting family from Yushan. The villa is located in Bao Ci Li (now called Bao Ci Bridge, at the foot of the northern Yushan mountain). It was formerly the other residence of Wu Wenke, Duke Ne of the Ming Dynasty. It occupies several acres of land and is famed for its white pine and red bean trees. Later, a plum garden of dozens of acres was added, but it is now abandoned. The Zhao family's ancestors moved from Jiangyin to Changshu. A man named Kui Chang, courtesy name Manhua, first managed the gardens and named them "Half Acre Garden." His son, Zongjian, courtesy name Cihou, also known as Cigon, protected the local area with a militia during the Red Sheep Rebellion. He was a close friend of Grand Tutor Gong Weng, Uncle Ping. He enjoyed entertaining guests, was fond of drinking, and possessed a rich collection of bronze and stone inscriptions, illustrations, and historical books. Xu Kang lived in his house for a long time, and Kang's "Before the Dreams End" was written in this villa. After Cigong passed away, the Grand Tutor wrote an epitaph for his tomb, saying: "Others are busy, but I am free, my heart holds armor and my will is stern." From this, his interests and ambitions can be seen. Cigong's son, Zhongju, was skilled in poetry and painting and also enjoyed collecting books. When Ye Jushang visited Yushan, he often went to see his rare books. When Jushang wrote "Poems on Book Collecting," he called him a small book collector, perhaps because he had not seen even a tenth of his collection.</p>
<p>Cigong's great-grandson, Bu Qi, courtesy name Junqian, also known as Guchun, was proud of his talent and fond of wine, not bound by convention. As a child, he was fond of playing and joking with other children. He once used a red gold landscape fan by Cheng Mengyang as armor, and in a moment, he would make butterfly pieces to dance with. He also once exchanged a fragment of a Song Dynasty handwritten copy of the "Veritable Records of Emperor Taizong of Song" for a cricket from a woodcutter. Eventually, it was passed on to Shanghai. Most of the books in this villa were later acquired by the local resident, Ding Chuwuo. One of them was dozens of volumes of Yuan Dynasty Zaju dramas, originally collected in the garden, which were also owned by Chuwuo, who kept them secret. It was not until the Dingchou Rebellion that they were dispersed and became widely known. Sun Kaidi wrote a long article of 200,000 words to praise them. The name of the Old Mountain Villa became known far and wide. However, Kaidi did not provide detailed information about the Zhao family's genealogy, and he did not fully understand the history of the book's circulation. I plan to write another article to describe it in detail.</p>
<p>Junqian loved learning in his adulthood, and was adept in poetry and art, also understanding epigraphy. He deeply regretted his childish fondness for mischief and became cautious in making friends, having the closest relationship with Mr. Yang Wuyang. During the Dingchou Rebellion, he encountered Japanese pirates, fought bravely, and died. He was not yet forty years old. After Junqian's death, his family declined further. The year before last, I visited this villa with Mr. Wuyang. Fortunately, the white pine and red bean trees were still intact. His family's livelihood was becoming increasingly difficult, and they hinted at the intention to sell the villa. Even the grass and trees of Pingquan cannot be permanently preserved. The Zhao family has owned this villa for several generations, and it is a great fortune to have such a high reputation in the country! How can a famous person be found to continue to own this villa and maintain its elegance and culture?</p>

<p>Feeling moved by the disaster of the times, I composed this poem:</p>
<p>Gold and swords destroy demons,</p>
<p>Overthrowing all living beings into the net.</p>
<p>Bitter change turns noble wine into poison,</p>
<p>Who can save the moths from the red flames?</p>
<p>The Nine Hells forever mourn flowers like the sea,</p>
<p>A myriad of eons know the moon is not a wave.</p>
<p>Disaster fills the land, the people are sick,</p>
<p>The disease of Vimalakirti startles all demons.</p>
<p>Written for Lu Xiaodan on Zhang Daqian's Painting of Entering Sichuan</p>
<p>Five Ding opened the road like Can Cong,</p>
<p>The mountain passes of Qin are in his palm;</p>
<p>Today, the rivers and mountains are returned to his control,</p>
<p>Opening the mountains still seems like a success.</p>
<p>Daqian's brush is ingenious and spiritual,</p>
<p>Modeling mountains and rivers, he has learned from the masters;</p>
<p>Alas, I am old and cannot enter Sichuan,</p>

<h3 id="e159">Visiting Sage Jiang on Confucius' Birthday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>In recent years, the Peking Opera world has produced a sage and a virtuous man. The virtuous man is Yu Shuyan, known as Great Virtuous Yu. Miaoxiang is kind and approachable, with the best relations, and is known as a beautiful sage. In "Silang Visits His Mother", the Yang Zongbao he plays has eight lines of lyrics, known as Jiang's tune, unmatched in the north and south. Today is Confucius' birthday, and all government agencies are on holiday. In the afternoon, a friend came to my residence to talk about opera. We happened to mention Miaoxiang, and I said that his new residence is on Dagu Road, not far from here, so we went to visit him together. Upon entering the door, his wife came out to greet us first and said, "Sixth Master (Miaoxiang is the sixth child) will go to Xujiahui Xinhua Factory tonight to film "Life and Death Hate", and he may have to work all night. He is resting now to conserve his energy and will come out in a while." About ten minutes later, Miaoxiang came out and exchanged casual greetings. I saw a new photo on the wall. Miaoxiang was standing in the middle in Chinese costume, with Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang on his left and right, wearing Western suits. I asked when it was taken. Miaoxiang said, "This picture was taken recently. Mr. Mei and Mr. Zhou both belong to the horse zodiac, and I belong to the tiger, so they wanted me to stand in the middle."</p>
<p>Talking about the death of Jin Shaoshan, Miaoxiang said, "After Shaoshan passed away, reports said that he was destitute. Tan Fuying and others in Beiping sang charity performances to help him. Before Tang Yunsheng came on stage at Tianchan, Huang Guaqiu and others sang a "Red Mane Horse", and the proceeds from the tickets, after deducting expenses, were all sent to Beiping to Shaoshan's family. Recently, someone came from Beiping and said that although Shaoshan had no cash after his death, his collection of snuff bottles was worth many millions, and he also had smoking pipes that were worth many millions, but they were all 'cold goods' and difficult to sell at a good price."</p>
<p>My friend praised his performance in "The Gathering of Heroes," and Miaoxiang said, "Xu Xiaoxiang was the best in 'The Gathering of Heroes.' Xiaoxiang returned to Suzhou at about fifty years old, and no one dared to sing this opera. One day, the big boss (Cheng Changgeng) encouraged Wang Lengxian (Guiguan) to try singing it, and everyone praised it. An old amateur opera fan, Master Sun (Chunshan), said, 'This is just ash.' I didn't catch up with Xu Xiaoxiang and can only learn from Wang Lengxian. You praise my 'Gathering of Heroes,' but Wang Lengxian sang it so well that some people still ridiculed it as ash. Compared to Xu Xiaoxiang, I can only be considered dirt under his feet." The above passage is truly the height of artful expression.</p>
<p>When we were saying goodbye, Miaoxiang said that he would warm up his voice. So his son played the erhu, and Miaoxiang sang a long passage from "Flying Tiger Mountain," truly satisfying his love for opera. Today is Confucius' birthday, and it is worth recording that I heard Sage Jiang warm up his voice. (Night under the lamp, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e162">American Doctors' Dirty Secrets <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, American medical technology has made rapid progress, but one dirty secret of the medical world that has been passed down for many years has not been stopped. This dirty secret is "fee-splitting"—the secret division of surgical fees paid by patients between internists and surgeons.</p>
<p>The most common form of fee-splitting is this: Dr. A, a general internist and surgeon, says to his patient: "I'm afraid this is appendicitis. I will ask Dr. B to take care of you. I introduce all my surgical patients to him. He is the best surgeon I know." Dr. B performed the surgery on the patient, and it went well.</p>
<p>Dr. A charges the patient a consultation fee of five or ten dollars, while Dr. B charges the patient a huge surgical fee—for example, one hundred and fifty dollars. When Dr. B receives the money, he divides seventy-five dollars to Dr. A.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the internist charges the patient the full fee and then splits it with the surgeon.</p>
<p>Sometimes fee-splitting is disguised under some pretext. The most common is that the surgeon uses the excuse of asking an internist to assist during the surgery, while the latter's actual work may be limited to holding a retractor or an anesthetic mask—this is fundamentally a "showing off" job. Sometimes, in order to thank the internist for referring business, the surgeon asks the patient to have their blood pressure checked at the internist's office several times after the surgery—charging twenty-five to fifty dollars each time!</p>
<p>Fifteen states in the United States consider fee-splitting between doctors illegal, and violators are subject to fines, imprisonment, or license revocation. However, even if law enforcement officials know that a doctor has violated this law, it is difficult to prosecute them because evidence of such illegal behavior is not easy to obtain.</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Record of Miss Lü Bicheng <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>"To become the top scholar in women's studies is also sad,</p>
<p>My lifelong achievements are buried again;</p>
<p>After hastily speaking the Dharma and discussing the scriptures,</p>
<p>I have only returned to the human world this once!"</p>
<p>This is the final poem by Ms. Lü Bicheng of Jingde at her deathbed in Hong Kong on January 24, 1943. Looking at this poem, it seems that she understood the principle of death and had no worries at all.</p>
<p>At that time, Hong Kong was in a period of occupation, and the country was also in the midst of the War of Resistance. News was blocked. Therefore, even a few years after her death, people still often inquired about her whereabouts.</p>
<p>When she was twelve years old, her father (Ruitian) passed away. On one occasion, her mother, Madam Yan, was kidnapped by bandits. She immediately wrote a letter to her uncle, Fan Yunmen, requesting assistance. At that time, Fan was the Jiangsu Provincial Administration Commissioner and arranged for rescue, and she was safely released.</p>
<p>When Yuan Shikai was the Governor-General of Zhili, he allocated public funds to send her to prepare for the establishment of the Tianjin Beiyang Women's Public School, first as the chief teacher and then promoted to supervisor (now known as the principal). At that time, she was only twenty-one years old, which was eight years before the Republic of China. Before she ran the school, she once served as a writer for the Ta Kung Pao. Qiu Jin admired her very much. Later, Qiu Jin published the "Chinese Women's News," and the inaugural speech was written by her.</p>
<p>She liked to travel and went to Europe and America twice. She had been to the United States, France, England, Italy, Switzerland, and other countries, especially staying in Geneva for the longest time. In the United States, she studied art at Columbia University. In Europe, she initiated a movement to protect life and abstain from killing with philanthropists from various countries, and at the same time translated Buddhist scriptures into English to spread Buddhism. She practiced vegetarianism and abstained from killing for her belief in Buddhism. Because of this, she bought a house in Hong Kong in 1935 and moved in. Not long after, she discovered that the pillars were infested with termites. If she eliminated them, it would go against the principle of not killing; otherwise, the termites would rot the pillars, the house would collapse, and people would suffer. She had no choice but to let the house go to others at a low price.</p>
<p>She wrote many works in her life. In addition to Chinese and Western essays, her collections of ci poems were printed several times, such as "Xin Fang Ci" and "Xiao Zhu Ci." In her preface, she explained the reasons for setting the drafts and printing them, saying, "I sigh at the difficulties of the world and the strange dramas of the family. All writings should be finalized in one's lifetime and printed at any time, so as to avoid being forgotten after death." From these words, we can know the purpose of her self-edited and printed ci poem collection. Her ci poems were most highly praised by Fan Yunmen. When "Xin Fang Ci" was printed, Fan commented on each poem, such as: "The legacy of the two masters of the Southern Tang," "Looser than Mei Xi, more delicate than Long Zhou," "Chen Junheng could not reach," "Jiaxuan's treasure hairpin and Fen Tao Ye Ferry cannot monopolize the beauty in front," "Clear, profound, and ancient, no less than Fan Xie Mountain House," "This ci is indeed from the Northern Song Dynasty," etc. From these, we can see the depth of her attainments and achievements in ci poetry.</p>
<p>She experienced many hardships and remained single to the end. In her life, she lived a luxurious life in terms of food and clothing. Later, she was enlightened and devoted herself to studying the inner scriptures and spreading Buddhism until the end of her life. All that remains are her poems and ci poems, a generation of talented women who died in a chaotic world, lonely and unheard of, which cannot help but make people feel sentimental! No wonder her last poem had the sad sound of "I have only returned to the human world this once."</p>
