<h3>社論　柏林危機的的訴諸聯大</h3>
<p>舉世囑目的莫斯科談判，經過一個多月的持續，終因蘇聯的堅持管制柏林的交通而告失敗了。英美法三國外長於接獲蘇聯答覆三強的「最後照會」之後，便在法國外交部舉行緊急會議，對於蘇聯的最後答覆，一致認爲蘇聯已拒絕解除對柏林的封鎖，而封鎖柏林已造成足以「威脅國際和平與安全」的局勢，因此乃决定將此一嚴重的柏林危機訴諸聯合國安全理事會。此舉雖為世人意料所及，聯合國秘書長賴伊早就在那裏考慮「要求安全理事會討論柏林危極」的一項問題，但安全理事會處理五强之間的紛爭，這還是第一次，而且它能否解决這個問題，又是聯合國的威信與存亡之所繫。現在聯合國第三屆大會正在巴黎的夏樂宮舉行，雖仍為世人視為世界和平的象徵，人類唯一的希望；但在它的四週却環繞着一片陰霾，顯示出它前途的黯淡，而今英美法三國將柏林危機訴諸聯大，又使聯合國面臨一大空前未有的嚴重考騐。</p>
<p>我們平心而論，在過去的三年之中，聯合國確曾替戰後的世界，消滅了不少仇恨，歧視，爭議和戰禍，尤其是安全理事會的成功多於失敗。例如調處印尼印荷衝突，印度印回之爭，巴勒斯坦猶阿戰爭，不能不說均已獲得相當的成就，使億兆人民避免戰禍；但又不能不指出聯合國的特質，它的生命完全寄托在「五强一致」的原則上，所以安全理事會的五個常任理事國均有行使「否决權」的特權，安理會欲作任何决議，只要有五强的任何一國表示異議，行使它的否决權，任何决議就不能成立。因此使安全理事會只能解決與五强關係較淺的問題，而不能解决與五强有直接利害關係的嚴重問題，三年以來，安全理事會處理國際問題的經過，就是一個絕好的明瞪。現在英美法三國外長不問安全理事會的本質，竟將柏林危樓訴諸聯大，控訴蘇聯違背憲章，除了引起聯合國大會的軒然大波而外，安全理事會能否解决此一問題，誰都知道，是漫無把握的。；</p>
<p>事實放在我們眼前，是非常明顯的，英美法三國果將柏林危機提請安全理事會處理，則蘇聯勢必行使其享受的否决權，使安全理事會欲通過任何决議均不能成立；卽使這次聯大對於否决權决定任何限制行使辦法，蘇聯必以去就力爭，堅决反對到底。萬一各國不顧蘇聯的反對，通過修改聯合國憲章的决議，測其結果所屆，勢必引起蘇聯的退出聯合國。所以我們從任何一個角度去觀察，英美法三國將柏林危機訴諸聯合國，在實際上並無意義可言，徒然增加聯合國一大難關，迫令東西兩集團在聯合國大會內攤牌而已。</p>
<p>至於柏林危樓的造成，在英美法方面說，共產勢力向西默步步緊迫，蘇聯又復封鎖柏林與西德之間的交通，實在忍無可忍，故非迫令蘇聯解除封鎖不可；此在蘇聯方面說，英美法三佔領區的合併，西德協定的締結，以及西德幣制的改革，都是反蘇防共的表示，不得不以封鎖柏林來抵銷它的作用·我們站在第三者的立塲，平心而論，也不能不謂「公說公有理，婆說婆有理」，問題的癥結乃雙方的思想不同與利害衝突，莫斯科談判一月餘終歸於失敗，也在於雙方的名執一辭，不能互忍互讓，只要雙方大家都有誠意，打開談判的僵局，並不是不可能的。所以我們認為柏林的危機，與其要訴諸聯合國母寗仍循由外交談判的途徑覓取和平解決的方案·現在，國際局勢正是危急的時候，西方民主國家的政治外交家還須要更大的毅力與耐心，尤其對於至今猶不失為世界和平象徵的聯合國，更要特別愛護，非至萬不得已，决不可迫令蘇聯退出，使聯合國僅成為西方集團的國際組織。所以英美法決將柏林問題訴諸聯合國，是値得重行玫慮的。</p>

<h3>貝文演說答覆維辛斯基　育斥蘇危害和平　擁兵三四百萬居心安在</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿七日電〕外相貝文廿七日在聯合國大會中，向蘇聯挑戰，要求蘇聯「為證明其誠意起見」，說出蘇聯武裝軍隊之實力，貝文指斥蘇聯一方面信誓旦且，自稱渴望和平，然其在德國之一切作爲，表明其語言悉屬子虛。又稱，「神經戰之威脅正懸於吾人頭上。」貝文隨卽要求蘇聯「拿出事實來，給我們看誠意之佐證。」貝文　詞大部係針對蘇代表　辛斯基上週之聯大演說。按難氏稱，西方國家團對蘇發動原子戰，又堅稱蘇聯眞意完全旨在和平。貝文大呼「蘇聯之一切行動拆穿蘇聯之言論」時，卽轉身面向維辛斯基。貝文演說之時，恰在西方以戰後最强硬之外交　文致蘇聯，宣佈西方已決定將柏林危機提交安理會之後數小時·員文提及德國時，雖未特別指出柏林危機，然對蘇聯於一九四六年拒絕美國所提締緒四十年協定永久解除德國武裝一舉，表示遺憾。渠並答　維氏所提五强一年內裁减軍備三分之一之提案稱，無人能知蘇聯三軍之實力，公有安全及信心，始可促進單縮。「維辛斯基先生顯然與太人意見相左，故且由渠明吿吾人以蘇聯武裝力量之眞相。」貝文稱，「吾人獲悉蘇聯三軍目前至少有三四百萬人，本人相信在戰前此數不足百萬，今者一國不願向世界宣佈其作為，而欲吾人將安全信賴該國，又烏乎可，依本人羣來，蘇聯之建議宛如要求全世界解除武裝，而蘇聯則仍秘不宣示其軍力。」英外相堅決支持西歐聯盟及復與歐洲計劃，並否認此二協定係針對蘇聯者。「如吾人不能根據理想以舉世為一家，不得已而求其次，應着眼於地區。吾人應與同心者協議，並興相互了解信賴者及願意與吾人了解信賴者合作。」貝文認為舉世所仰望之世界政府，或可從地區了解中產生。對　氏所稱西方準備對蘇作戰一節，貝文斥之為「悉屬虛構」及「了無意識」。渠稱，「然則蘇聯之神經戰用意究安在？維辛斯基先生固無庸答覆。盡人皆知蘇方欲希腦陷入其蛛綱，取守勢者厥爲吾人，莫斯科所發動「冷戰」之犧牲者亦厥為吾人。」</p>
<h3>原子戰浩劫一旦降臨　唯一負責者厥爲蘇聯</h3>
<p>貝文向蘇聯保證不必懼西方之攻擊蘇聯土地而可安享和平，「吾人永不致進攻蘇聯。另一方面，蘇聯於安定國內後，如利用他國之土地而準備進攻吾人，則必將產生艱鉅之局勢，而吾人不得不為本身之國防打算。」渠鄭重警吿全球稱，如世界籠罩於原子戰爭中，唯一負責者厥為蘇聯。論及聯合國對管制原子能一無成就時，貝文稱，「本人願以最嚴正之立塲聲明，如原子彈之浩刦降臨世間，人類所受一切災難，悉應由一國負其全責，蓋該國拒絕為為人類幸福上與他國合作管制及發展原子能。貝文又質詢蘇聯是否仍恪邀馬列主義之見解，卽非共產及共產國家間無最後協定之可言。是否蘇聯政府一切作為，僅係一種策略，是否蘇政府應在過程中言論動人，而其宗旨仍不變。</p>
<p>援引列寗言論</p>
<p>至是肥碩之英外相乃引列寗之言稱，最後勝利者非共產主義，卽係「資本主義國家」，「在終局未臨前，蘇維埃共和國及布爾喬亞國家間必將發生一連串可怕之衝突。」貝文詢問，「吾人對蘇聯之國際合作言論，遲遲未依票面價値接受，維辛斯基先生鑑於上述列寗之言，當可知其所以然矣。」貝文提起維氏所謂西方企圖對蘇發動原子戰一節時，不禁情緒激動，手指維氏大呼：「此乃歷史上亘古不變之老花樣。指斥他人者必定本身有此企圖而將責任諉諸他人」。</p>
<p>四座掌聲發雷</p>
<p>貝文演說旣畢，四座掌聲殷股如雷。老於聯大者稱一般演辭以受人歡迎者以此為最。維氏於貝氏演說後，卽離座而起，首席代表多人亦繼起效尤。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿七日廣播：預料英美法三國將於廿七日以三國致蘇聯有關德國問題之照會副本遞交聯合國，附帶　急請求將本案於數日內列入安理會議程·該項照會於廿六日夜送交蘇聯駐美及駐法大使，並於骨七日最送至倫敦，交蘇駐英大使。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕英美法三國廿六日午夜（巴黎時間）將一項長達十二頁之照會送致蘇聯駐法大使鮑格荳洛夫，該照會共包括下列十三點：（一）蘇聯在柏林所採取之阻擾西方三强接濟佔領軍措施，實足以使柏林居民感受飢餓及經濟破產之威脅。（二）西方三强不能接受妨害渠等在柏林權利之辦法，但準備接受與其在柏林權利義務相符合之實際辦法。</p>
<p>（三）在莫斯科談判中，柏林封鎖解除及蘇聯馬克直於四强管制之下已獲致協議。（四）史達林曾表示六月十八目前所　述之限制均將解除，四强財政委員會有權管制蘇區之德國銀行，因此銀行係與柏林全市之業務有關也。（五）四强政府致其在柏林四軍事長官之訓令，係以與史達林會見之結果為根據者，蘇駐德軍司令對此項訓令並未遵守。渠要求對柏林空運予以限制，並拒不承認財政委會對銀行發行鈔票有管制權利，渠並要求柏林與他區之貿易置於蘇聯管制之下。（六）蘇聯當局允許目的在推翻柏林市政之示威遊行。（七）九月十四日西方三强代表促蘇政府注意此一事實，卽蘇聯駐柏林軍司令並未對莫斯科協定注意及之。（八）九月十四日蘇聯致三强之照會中，對於空運貿易及財政委會之權力，仍擁護蘇聯駐柏林章司令之立塲。（九）九月廿二日三强詢問蘇政府是否準　除柏林對鎖稱如蘇聯對前次之協定漫不注意，而決意損害西方三强在柏林之權利，則繼織談判亦很何益。（十）蘇聯於九月廿五日對此之薇文三强認為不能滿意，蘇聯對於柏林管制有條件讓步，四張管制及貿易許可證之加以承萬，皆屬出於欺騙。蘇聯政府欲從新控制空中客運與貨運，此舉係表示蘇聯對柏林與西區之空運有權加以限制，如空運在蘇聯任意處置之下，則將來蘇聯如欲實行封鎖隨時皆可為之。（十一）蘇駐柏林軍同令最近鼓勵推翻柏林市政府及對於談判之態度，證明蘇聯政府並未將協定加以實施，而欲損害西方三强在柏林之權利。（十二）柏林問題並非一技術問題此證明蘇聯政府企圖以非法手段，達到其政治目的，換言之，企圖攫得柏林經濟政治及社會命脈之全部控制，將之合併於蘇佔區之內。（十三）在此種情形下，蘇聯應對目前不能援用聯合國憲章第卅三條加以解決之局勢負全部責任，此項局勢造成威脅和平及國際安全之不良後果，職斯之故，英美法三國政府為保持渠等在柏林之權利，目前有採取築等認為必要之手段，以維持其在柏林之地位，深覺渠等有將蘇聯政府此項行動提出聯合國安理會之義務。</p>

<h3>美國務院發表白皮書　揭露談判失敗經過　蘇違反諾言岡顧外交信義</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國國務院二十七日公佈長達二萬四千字之「白皮書」，對四强關於柏林問題的毫無結果的談判，以及蘇聯如何撕毀史達林總理解除封鎖的保證的情形，逐點說明。同時，美·英·法三國已將柏林問題提出聯合國，並聯合照會蘇聯，認為柏林問題係對世界利平的一種肯定性的威脅。</p>
<p>「美國白皮書」是美國與蘇聯任何談判中最長及最完全的紀錄，渠强調蘇聯在原則上曾同意解除對鎖的事實，但蘇聯在柏林的軍事長官，却「採取與史達林在莫斯科所提出的明白的保證的相反態度。」關於蘇聯的突然改變態度，官方未作解釋。但此事如非史達林打消其保證，卽為總攬全權的蘇聯政治局推翻史達林的命令，則甚為明顯。</p>
<p>國務院白皮書內稱，美駐蘇大使史密斯與英·法使節在八月二日與史達林的第一次會議中，强調「柏林局勢的極度危險性」。在四小時的會議結束後，西方三强認為柏林爭端可能獲得解決，因為史達林曾明白說明，蘇聯無意「將盟軍逐出柏林」。但此項樂觀則在與蘇外長莫洛托夫的幾次會議中消失。當談判瀕於失敗時，西方强國再度設法與史達林會商，此項會議因於八月甘三日在克林姆宮舉行。在此次會議中，談判頗獲進展，一星期後，乃能獲得在原則上解除封鎖的協議，而將「技術問題」交由在柏林的四强軍事長官研究。</p>
<p>白皮書中對此次會議中史達林提出上項協議時的情形，叙述謹愼而詳細。文中稱，在史達林退出前，史密斯大使特別利用此一機會，提出明白而肯定的問題，希望能獲得關於蘇聯地位的確切的說明。史達林乃同意對在柏林的蘇聯軍事長官發出指令，解除對西方强國的一切限制，「由於此項經過史達林親自證實的諒解，最後乃對柏林的四强軍事長官發出指令，俾擬定技術上的協議。</p>
<p>談判移至柏林以後，西方强國立卽發現蘇軍事長官索柯洛央斯基元帥並不準備實現莫斯科會談中達成的諒解，而且他不但不减少對於陸上還輸的限制，却更進一步對現存的空中運輸，增加了新的限制。因此在柏林的索柯洛夫斯基元帥對於輸限制·通貨·以及貿易三項問題，完全採取與史達林在莫斯科提出的明白的保證的相反態度。而且，他還不斷地表示了許多對談判的成功，或失敗無足輕重的態度，在柏林的一星期技術討諭，其至比在莫斯科的一個月談判，更加無益。</p>
<p>在以後數度更無成功希望的莫斯科會談後，美英法三國政府乃於九月廿二日分別在三國京城向蘇聯大使提出照會，要求蘇聯答覆「是否準備立卽解除封鎖措施」。但蘇聯在廿五日的答覆中却避不作答，反而譴實西方强國應負談判失敗之責，並聲稱，「建立蘇聯佔領軍司令對空中貨運及客運的管制，實與鐵道水路及公路運輸的管制同屬必須」。四强間在七月三十日卽開始舉行的秘密談判，終吿失敗，此舉實已顯示西方希望藉秘密外交而减輕東酉間緊張關係的企圖，業已宣吿結束。</p>
<p>白皮書中所舉四强關於柏林問題的談判過程如次：</p>
<p>七月廿日　美駐蘇大使史密斯訪問克林姆宮，建議與史達林及莫洛托夫「坦白並公開檢討」解除柏林對鎖的可能性。</p>
<p>七月廿一日　西方使即分別會見莫洛托夫，以設法與史達林當面會商。</p>
<p>八月二日　與史達林作第一次會談，史密斯指出柏林形勢「極度嚴重」，但西方國家「不願」相信蘇聯意欲將盟軍逐出柏林。史達林力稱此非蘇聯之目的，但認為西方國家已無佔領柏林之法權。渠指稱封鎖為必須者，因為西方國家計劃建立西德政府，並將西德通貨引入柏林。史達林建議將西方通貨移出柏林，並逐步解除一切柏林的交通限制。美英法三國認為柏林危機可望解除。</p>
<p>八月六日·九日·十二日·十六日西方國家在與莫洛托夫舉行數度會議，企圖根據與史達林討論之原則以草擬協議後，樂觀的希望日趨消失。</p>
<p>八月廿三日　與史達林作第二次會談，在原則上達成協議。史達林稱，蘇聯不反對西方盟國留駐柏林，西方盟國當可與蘇聯分担管制柏林德國政府，在柏林四强軍事長官研究技術問題後，對鎖當可解除。史達林並同意指令索柯洛夫斯基元帥，解除一切對西方國家的限制。</p>
<p>尺月卅一日　技術討論在柏林開始，賡續一星期，但索柯洛夫斯基顯然不願實現在莫斯科達成的諒解。在會商進行中，渠不但未减少交通限制，且反而增加，此外，渠更取消四强管制通貨。</p>
<p>九月十四日三國政府在致史達林及莫洛托夫的輔助備忘錄中，抱怨頗烈。備忘錄中特別指出，在莫斯科會議及指令中，均絕未提及限制空運，備忘錄中並以識剌之語氣照會蘇聯，「指令的目的在解除限制而非增加新限制」。</p>
<p>九月十八日蘇聯政府答覆西方國家，認為彼等「曲解」指令，索柯洛大斯基則完全準確。蘇聯政府並引證所謂柏林管制委會一九四五年十一月三十日的決議，以支持其管制柏林空運的要求。</p>
<p>九月廿二日　西方國家堅決聲明，彼等不能接受任何加諸空運的限制，並要求蘇聯說明其是否準備解除封鎖，俾能「造成繼續談判的可能條件」。</p>
<p>九月廿五日　蘇聯答覆三國，認為在莫斯科達成的協議，必須實現，並堅稱，「空運不能不加管制」。</p>
<p>九月廿六日　西方國家通知蘇聯，彼等已將柏林問題提交聯合國安理會，傳「國際和平及安全可能免於進一步之危機。」</p>

<h3>當局嚴防金鈔出境　突撃普查火車乘客　廠經理帶三萬美元扣留送金管局訊究　共獲三十餘起均令出兌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兩路局為配合經檢工作，防止金鈔外移，昨晨由檢査站站長李如河率領路警百餘人，會同駐站憲兵及戡建大隊駐站人員，對凱旋號及飛快車旅客，實施突擊普遍檢査。當査獲携帶美鈔出境案卅餘件，總數達三萬餘美元。其中最大一起達美鈔三萬元，係於飛快車中一衣淡藍色西裝旅客所携之手提皮箱中抄獲，路警以其數量鉅大，當將該旅客扣留，帶警務處訊問。據供：名魏家修，山東濟南人，為本市寳興麵粉廠徐州分廠副經理，該批美鈔係由上海廠帶往蚌埠分廠者。詢其用途，則支吾不能答。路局以其嫌疑重大，向督導員辦公室請示後，於下午一時半將人鈔連同案卷一併解送中央銀行督導員辦公室，並經蔣督導員批交金管局訊究。其他携有數十元成言餘元美鈔旅客，均遵檢査人員勸導，將所携外幣向中央銀行兌換金圓劵，路局並給予退票優待。（按凱旋號飛快車等對號座車規定不准退票）。另有乘車返京之交通部第二區電訊管理局下關材料廠職員唐文畊，亦身邊藏有美鈔二元，因數量過小，不願因此而躭誤旅程，請路警將此二元美鈔代兌金圓券後，捐贈慈善機關，路局警務處於下午卽將此款代送漕河涇難童難民敎養所。另有一駐國外某高級外交官亦出美鈔二百廿元，交檢査人員託代兌金圓券，當由警務處出給收據，他日憑此領款。事後據路局警務處發言人談稱：路局對旅客實施普遍檢査，向無前例，此次經警務處王處長與各負責檢査人員迭次商討後，始決定採用突擊檢査，在不妨碍旅客旅行便利之前提下，此項突擊檢査今後將隨時實施，下月一日起，如再査獲私帶金鈔出境，除金鈔沒收外，携帶之旅客一律移送督導員辦公室嚴懲不貸。</p>
<h3>私運美金出境嫌疑　胡好離滬飛港　當局不及逮捕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市經管督導員辦公處於昨日午後七時，證實胡好（卽胡為之）已於淸晨搭機遠走香港。該處人員表示：「督導員辦公室於上午十時下令逮捕胡好，其罪狀為有私運美金赴港之重大嫌疑，但胡好已於淸晨飛港，致被兎脫，此中情節，頗為複雜，現有關當局正設法使胡好歸案」。</p>
<p>赴港曾得許可</p>
<p>氫悉：胡好之離滬飛港，在手續方面，事前曾由已遭逮捕之虎標永安堂上海辦事處代理經理鄭源貴向警備部聲請許可證，其理由為「茲有本堂總經理胡好先生在滬工作完畢返港」，經該部審核後，於本月廿日批准，而其有效期至昨日為止，故胡昨晨上機前，雖由駐機塲檢査人員盤問檢査，卒因手續完備，仍得從容而去。胡離滬後，中航公司卽將此項存根送交警備部註銷。迄十時許警局方面接獲逮捕命令，派員擬將其拘捕偵訊，此時胡已離去二小時矣。事後警局方面曾傳中航公司售票處副處長秦叔賢訊問。</p>
<p>旅客單上無名</p>
<p>又此項消息傳出後，曾有人去電中航公司訊問胡好是否已離滬。但據該公司聲稱：令日赴港旅客名單中，並無胡好其人。是否胡好另用其他名字登機，抑或許可證另有問題，又成為一謎。</p>
<p>原贓並未短少</p>
<p>（又訊）昨日報載代經理鄭源貴盜竊之美鈔，在吊出原贓檢點數目時，曾發覺缺少美鈔一八五元，昨晨經蔣股長解交浙江實業銀行複點總數，則並無短缺，方知是當初倉卒間檢點之誤。至鄭則於供認行竊後，業由該分局當日下午移送地檢處究辦。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕據有關方面透露，據密吿，胡好之弟胡蚊，於廿四日乘機飛港時，卽擬將二萬九千元美鈔携港，當時以軍警檢査嚴密，而未予携去。未幾該項美鈔卽以失竊聞。經過情節，頗多啓人疑　之處。據該有關方面指出，可能係一預佈之疑陣云。但昨據永安堂方面表示：廿四日飛港之人並非胡蛟，而為胡好之最小兄弟胡一虎，且亦並未有携鈔出境之企圖。</p>

<h3>標售敵僞房地產　第一批明日公布　何浩若闡明政府加速處理決心　原居住人限十天以內優先承購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院敵偽產業處理姿員會主任委員何浩若，刻為督導加速處理敵偽產業，特於廿六日自京來滬，昨晨十時在中央銀行會議室邀集各關係當局蔣經圓·劉藝芸·程遠帆·駱美中·李立俠·沈冠亞·張茲闔等，舉行會議，當決定：（一）明日（廿九）公佈標售第一批敵偽房地產七十九所，共一百餘幢，原住人限十天內，可優先承購，逾期卽公開標售，原住人須於雙十節前讓出。如旣不購買，又不讓出，卽强制執行。（二）標售次序：（甲）花園洋房，（乙）倉庫大樓，（丙）里弄房屋。又何氏於昨日下午三時，復在國行會議室招待本市新聞界，並於昨晚返京。何氏於談話中列舉五點，摘錄如次：</p>
<p>替游資謀出路</p>
<p>（一）加速出售敵偽產業，便是替游資謀出路之一種經濟方法。（二）出售敵偽物資，能收縮游資，穩定物價。以上海一區說，撥作金圓準備的敵偽產業，共値四一，一〇八，八九〇·九四美元。如全部出售，可收回一六四·四三五，五六三·七二金圓。</p>
<p>先賣花園洋房</p>
<p>（三）現在政府處理的辦法。己由九月廿五日行政院第九次臨時會議決定：1敵偽房地產一律按市價估價後，通知住戶，限十日內承購。光交保證金半數，其餘自通知日起，一個月內繳淸。逾期不繳，沒收保證金。如十日內不來承購，作放棄論，卽行公開招標。2敵偽房地產一經標售，住戶須於一個月內遷讓，以便交付得標人，遠者由經濟督導員辦公處强制執行。依照此辦法，決先從大戶鉅室的花園洋房辦起。人民在法律前雖是一律平等，但一定要從有力量的和在上的做起。我們相信沒有人會旣不承購，又不遷讓。果有其人，無論他是軍政長官，豪强互賈，社會名流，我們一定按照政府規定的辦法，派軍警把他們的舖蓋像俱，丟到街上，把他們的家眷，趕出去，換句話說，這就呌做强制執行。這是政府的法令，幷不是執行機關要做惡人。在處理敵偽產業的時候，我們一定要顧到克勤克儉為國犧牲現在毫無辦法，住在敵偽產業房屋裏面的公務人員，和一般窮苦的平民。我們希望合理合法的來處理。</p>
<p>是良好的投資</p>
<p>（四）購買敵偽產業，是良好的投資，並且帮助了政府收縮游資，使物價平穩，惠及一般平民。（五）政府決心合法合理的，公開的，迅速處理敵偽物資。本人率命督導處理此項業務，一定不顧任何困難，來完成任務。現已決定於十月一日在京召集各地負責人開會，並約集各有關機關派員參加，公開檢討。本人徐須赴平津靑島等地薔導外，並定每兩星期來滬一次，聽取各方意見，希望民意機開予以監督，與論界予以協助。</p>

<h3>法幣公債持有人　呼籲提高清償率</h3>
<p>本市法幣公債持有人以法幣公債與外幣公債同為國債，而政院處理辦法中，待遇大分軒輊，殊失公允合理。除聯合推定代表向立法，行政兩院請願改善外，幷於昨日下午招待新聞界公開呼籲。據債券持有人代表主席宋謝銘玖稱：行政院公佈之國債處理辦法中，規定法幣公債，巳中籤各價之本息，一律以法幣一還一折合金圓劵償還，未中籤各債之本金，一律以倍數提前債淸，未中　之息票，與已中籤之本息，同樣辦法，此種辦法，凡持有法幣公債者，莫不認為太不合理．最後渠幷表示：對當局此項經濟改革政策，絕對擁護，但希望政府在仍以五萬五千億金圓整理國債之原則下，對各項外幣公債，改依「八·一九」國行掛牌兌換率（卽法幣四八七，〇〇〇元對一美元）淸償，以此項减少支出都份，提高法幣公債之淸償率，以維民信而昭公允云。</p>

<h3>紗布等業議定　登記成品原則</h3>
<p>棉紡織業，紗商公會，染織公業公會，棉布業公會等四公會，因存貨登記，執行上彼此有關，特於昨日下午，假有業公會舉行聯席會議，討論存貨登記共同辦法：</p>
<p>（一）棉紗棉布棧單，均以持有人登記為限，如遇出單多日而未能提貨者，登記人塡報時，應斟酌字面，塡寫待派或待提字樣。</p>
<p>（二）棉紗棉布定單，由廠商登記。</p>
<p>（三）委託加工染色應塡報委託廠商，所決定加工染色之色彩名稱。</p>
<p>現登記單業於昨日全部發出，今日交回，將於二十九日下午五時截止</p>
<h3>棉紗市況疲弱</h3>
<p>棉紗昨市仍因催辦存貨登記，人心虛怯，各方納意益淡，檯面帮多靜觀趨勢，惟本街去化仍熱，市况平庸。</p>
<p>四十二支四十支卅二支各級細紗，市上供售不旺，價仍堅硬。廿一支雙馬開做七八三元，中間吐售甚多，市况轉軟，跌勢甚健，臨收以七六〇元了結，挫落二三元。廿支各檔未見榮辱，十六支亦站原盤，十支童子軍跌勢亦勁，收市以五八三元結束，較上週六低落十七元。</p>
<h3>布疋去銷暢旺</h3>
<p>棉布在限期登記存貨聲中，市况轉疲，喊價較週六多吿盤挫。</p>
<p>龍頭細布自二六圓六角步退至廿六圓一角，臨收又回好至二六圓四角，較週六價軋低三角。五福福及喇叭童細布均各挫四角。龍頭B細布自二四圓八角退至二四圓五角。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰在穩檔盤旋，終以二七圓六角午收，軋低一角。跳鯉，雷峯塔，一一等品，金蓮妙舞，四君子白印嗶嘰等，均有交易，全市總共成交額計三千七百疋。</p>
<h3>聯購國棉資金</h3>
<p>民營認繳二千五百萬</p>
<p>蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會，昨召開民營會員代表會議，商討國棉聯購有關事宜。議決民營認繳資金二千五百萬金圓，已擬定按錠分担辦法。唯各廠以周轉資金均不甚完裕，對上項聯購資金繳付日期太促，頗感困難，擬請酌予展延云。</p>
<h3>人絲交易平庸</h3>
<p>人絲市况，昨日交易淸稀，走勢平庸。本街絲織業因配貨供源充足，納胃甚淡，絲號門銷，去路仍感熟絡，日貨熟門各檔，塲上供售不多，客帮進意亦淡。一二〇號天橋金三馬東洋均無做開，雜牌各檔，依限略有交易。</p>
<h3>銀錢業存放　國外外匯資產</h3>
<p>限九月底前申報登記</p>
<p>市政府昨准財政部代電開：「奉行政院訓令，査中華民國人民存放國外外匯資產登記管理辦法第五條規定，中華民國人民，除其經常生活，本居在國外應視為華僑者外，均應將截至民國三十七年八月廿日為止，存放國外之外匯資產，於民國三十七年十二月卅一日以前，依照規定表格，向中央銀行或其委托之銀行申報登記。其在民國三十七年八月廿一日以後，所獲得之外匯資產，應自獲得之日起，兩個月內，申報登記。</p>
<p>茲以國內銀錢業所有外匯資產；有機前申報登記之必要，特規定鎭儀業對其存放國外外匯資產之申報登記，限於民國三十七年九月三十日以前為之。其應甲報而不申報，或申報不實者，一經査明，卽以違反經濟管制法令論，吊銷其營業執照，或予以停業處分。</p>
<p>其有違反同辦法第八條之規定，自民國三十七年八月二十日起，意圖避免申報登記，將外匯資產移轉於國外任何自然人法人，成其他社團者，一經査明，並依同辦法第十一條第一項之規定，依妨害國家總動員法懲罰暫行條例第五條之規定，嚴予懲處，除分令外，合行令仰轉飭遵照等因到部，自應遵辦，相應電請貴市政府查照，督促當地各行莊，切會遵照辦理為荷」，聞市政府已訓令有關各局，分別督促，本市各行莊，切實遵行。</p>
<h3>食米價格平定　麵粉市場仍陷停頓</h3>
<p>昨日米市仍平定，價格幾無上落。市上秈米供應較多，惟高貨粳米仍感缺乏，做價殊為平穩。昨日到貨，南市塲二千二百〇三石，北市一千一百十九石，二市合計三三二二石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>交易難以展開，因廠方祇有配售予零售商，批發商無貨可得，致亦無貨供應市塲，市塲交易陷於停頓。又配粉辦法改為每三日配一次，為六十包，等於每日每戶二十包。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>堅消，到貨日見稀少，致供者寥寥，黃豆價站限度，交易淸淡，生仁稍有做開。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>趨堅，因各糧俱達限度，人心轉堅，出戶轉稀。豆油廠方稍有開出，價升五角，生菜油最高為四十六元，亦升五角，生油始終平定。豆餅客帮有去化，廠開四元六角，每戶百片。</p>
<h3>收兌金銀外幣統計</h3>
<p>八月廿三至九月廿五日</p>
<p>自八月二十三日起，至九月二十五日止，本市中央銀行及其所委託各銀行，收兌金銀外幣數量，計：（一）黃金七十九萬六千零五十兩三錢四分五厘，（二）白銀七十三萬五千零七十三兩二錢二分六匯，（二）銀元二百三十一萬三千八百三十三元五角，（四）銀角二百三十四萬一千零七十一萬枚雙毫，（五）美鈔二千零五十二萬八千八百七十五美元零一角九分，（六）港幣六百八十六萬零五百二十一元六角七分，（七）非鈔六千零二十七比索。</p>
<h3>僑資是否僑匯　需有兩種證明</h3>
<p>當地領事館及僑委會</p>
<p>據輸管會副秘書處長孫中岳氏語記者，自備外匯輸入物資辦法三種，已由輸管會擬具完竣，正呈政院核准中。（一）關於已付價款之國外訂貨申請轍入辦法，其主要者卽在八·一九以前價購之物資，可以允許進口。（二）至僑資及國人在外資金投資國內生產事業辦法，因經濟緊急處分令的頒佈，前項辦法正在修訂。現在祇有僑資一項，如何證明是僑匯，為嚴密計，經決定不僅需當地領事館的設明，並須經僑務委員會的核准。其投資於國內的生產事業，並須有國內相關機關核准的生產計劃。由於以上手續，故目前申請的僑資，尙不甚多。（三）至中央銀行外幣外匯支付辦法輸入實施細則，經過兩次開會討論，方法力求簡單嚴密，以便外幣外匯所有人申請云。</p>
<h3>食糖微升</h3>
<p>昨日糖市止跌微升，市况平穩，走勢榮辱互見，價格先軟後挺，市上供求甚平，臨收微見升騰。</p>
<p>二十期台赤棧單承上週六疲勢，人心仍軟，開後未見挺秀。嗣以本街去化仍熱，擾面因聞本期合糖公司配售，均係粗砂，塲上現貨不多，於是人心稍緊，喊價微步挺升。收市以二十四元七角結束，中砂粗砂亦見帶升。</p>

<h3>詩的看法</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>「橫看成嶺側成峯，遠近看山了不同」，這話雖然說一個人容易迷惑，但畢竟還有點標準，大約橫着成嶺的，側了就未必是，眼睛看客觀事實，多少有點準兒。說到了詩，可就比這個更麻煩了，如果你橫看他成嶺，我也許就偏偏看成峯，而且可以站在我的立塲跟你抬槓，駡你。假設你說是嶺我也說是嶺呢，人家又要駡我，像蒼蠅似的，隨着人家的垃圾亂嗡嗡。你看，「李杜詩篇萬古傳，至今已覺不新鮮」，「預支五百年新意，到了千年又覺陳」！這還了得！這份「新意」，就使我們平庸的人毫無辦法。</p>
<p>你作詩的有沒有新意是另一個問題，事實上你的東西如果「不新鮮」恐怕就沒有主顧，那麼只好糊在毛厕墻上了。我這裏要說的乃是對於別人乃至古人詩的看法，能够瞧出一點新意來，不管這個新意是不是眞是古人的或者別人的「本意」，但是你能說的頭頭是道，讓別人心服口服，那可就老大不容易。我讀了一二十年中國文學史，說來說去老是那一套，「郊寒島瘦」，「杜陵詩史」，陳穀子爛芝蘇，隔夜油條，一點「新味兒」都沒有！就是作文學批評史的，也只是亂抄文苑傳，儒林傳，詩話，詞話，文評。過去中國詩人或學人，又都喜歡於政事之餘學術之餘寫那麽一兩卷××軒××齋的詩話之類，作為自己文集的「集屁股」，這裘面太半是抄了人云亦云的話充數，要不，就是捧同門，擰朋友，捧親戚。鼎鼎大名的隨園詩話，裏面誠然有若千可取的觀點，可是捧女弟子的東西也敎人肉麻。甚至還有專門替自己鼓吹的，那就更加不成話，我們搞文學史或文藝批評，要是只把這些東西作實藏，一定不會弄出什麼好玩意來！</p>
<p>最近我請聞一多的唐詩雜論，覺得滿足了我多年不滿足的慾望。他絕對不人云亦云的胡扯一套，凑足字數算文章；或者，抄引一大篇舊書，加上個頭尾，扯兩句淡話，也就算自己的名山之業。我們在他所作的「宮體詩的自贖」裏，看出六朝到唐代詩風到底是怎麽演變的？劉希夷·張若虛·盧照鄰在初唐的詩風裏有了什麽樣的作用？道比開口陳子昂閉口魏徽那麼講初唐時可是大有分別了，就是初唐四傑，他也看出其間的分別和硬把性格不同的兩組揑到一塊的不對來。這種議論，全不是用傳統的方法吿訴你，像敎科書似的一·二·三·四往你腦袋裏塞知識，他是用了帶領你的感情的方法，讓你不由得不跟着他的路子走。詩文評作到這個程度，可以說本身就是一首好詩。還有那個說孟浩然和賈島的兩個短篇，我們好像看見「風神散朋」的孟老先生在襄陽的鹿門山過着隱士生活一般，我想聞先生與他是湖北同鄉，也許格外有好感，所以把這位「不才明主棄」的詩人，弄得仙人化了罷？賈島這一篇一開頭就是很有趣的，把中晚唐的詩派分析成了一個私塾房的幾個先生幾個學生，有的在駡街，有的在拼命用功預備大考，有的在發牢騷，好不熱　。這個前身是釋子的賈浪仙，</p>
<p>讓這些熱得頭昏腦脹的傢伙們　陰暗處休息休息，於是他勝利了。</p>
<p>在傳統的文學史裏我們非當遺憾的，總看不到這樣的「勝義」。我想中國文學的研究幾乎也到了令人熱昏的時候了，我們該當摘下大帽子來風凉風凉，打開過去詩文評家給我們糊的高麗紙窗十透一口氣，看看天上到底有什麽色的雲霞，地上有什麼樣的花木，不要再矮子看戲，隨人短長吧——可是有一樣，要幹這種偉大的工作，起碼得自己先是一個有理想會分析的詩人，而且得大大的用一陣子功。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會在巴黎</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>第三屆聯合國會　全體大會業已於九月廿一日在巴黎的夏變宮博物院原址揭幕。以過去三年中的經驗言，世人對於聯合國組織最初所蘊蓄的理想是失望了，就是本屆會議，以眼前的國際背景言，恐怕結果仍不外在一塲唇槍舌劍之後，大家不歡而散。不過一種理想的實現，尤其是關於人類大同的理想，自有重重困難與阻礙，祗要人類一日不喪失對世界永久和平的信念，則聯合國組織目前雖有許多缺點，它畢竟仍是値得為人類所追求的一個理想。</p>
<p>夏樂宮博物院是巴黎全市最大也是最新型的建築，佔地十英畝，恰和著名的厄飛爾士塔遙遙相對。戰後法國雖然民窮財困，但為佈置會塲，在今年五月中卽開始動員了三千名工人，日夜從事裝修改造的工作。全部會址可以容納各國代表一千五百人，秘書及其他職員一千三百人，以及較之更多的各國新聞記者與攝影記者。</p>
<p>國人對於這偉大的國際會議在其境內舉行，自然感到興奮與光榮。他們根據聯合國會議法文的第一字縮寫，稱之謂「和能夏國」（Onusia），而事實上確視聯合國為一巴黎城內的獨立國。</p>
<p>在「和能夏國」一國境」內的秩序，悉由來自成功湖的五十名聯合國警察負維持之責，法國的警察祇在「境」外維持交通及一般秩序，除與會的法國代表和法國來賓外，其唯一能以法國公職人員身份駐入「和能夏國」「境」內的，僅有廿名救火員。法國警察僅在奉聯合國安全理事會緊急召喚時始能入「境」。這批警察都是事先經過特別挑選，每人至少須懂一二種外國語言。</p>
<p>在會議期間，「和能夏國」有它自設的銀行，郵局，旅行社，新聞處，甚至有一所小規模的臨時醫院。在會議議塲的兩廂，一邊是譯員室，他們能將每一個人的演詞當塲譯成各國言，轉為廣播，另一邊則為廣播·電話·及電氣打字室。</p>
<p>電話室中有廿三名接綫生，管理二千四百隻的電話，且可與各國代表的本國通話。在會塲的地下室中是印刷所，每天能印二噸紙，卽相當一萬册書。會塲中每天並留出八百隻坐位供給前在參觀的來質。</p>
<p>對於這樣一個規模宏大的會議，吃的問題自然十分重要。巴黎當局特地在特洛卡杜廣塲建築了一所能容一千座上客的餐館，內更附設四個酒吧間，所有各種名烟夫酒，無一應有盡有，法國著名的香檳，當然更不在話下了。</p>
<h3>東西爪鱗</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>美國政府因為建築材料價値昂貴，曾在威斯康辛州試造紙屋二幢，所用材料全屬紙質代用品，係經科學家多人悉心研究而成。現在這二幢房子已經造了四年，經過　霜雨　各種天氣，毫無損壞</p>
<p>國科學　試用牛奶作為肥料，大獲成功，據說用過牛奶的土壤大有進步，所產的洋山芋及洋葱遠較未曾用過牛奶施肥的土壤為多。美國農村中有若干區域產牛奶太多，因遝費太貴，輸出時不能　　，將來頗有用作肥料的可能。</p>
<p>警犬們的嗅覺　靈，但也常犯錯誤，所以現在美國法院中調査證據時，凡警犬的指示必須輔以其他證據，否則不予採納。</p>
<p>一九三〇年，紐約市內某兩座相距頗遠的大厦中，曾裝置一種新的設備，凡在這兩幢房子內通電話時，打電話的人可以籍無棧電等影而看見對方的面部。這種設備費用甚鉅，所以至今未能普及</p>
<h3>史記無奇氣</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>前人似曾說司馬遷因遨遊過名山大川，受其感召，故為文有奇氣。這話似近情，然與事理不符。名山大川事關地理，司馬遷寫的是歷史，二者似並無牽涉。名山大川縱然壯觀，何能使史書有奇氣？</p>
<p>史記之奇，非奇於　，更非奇於為文之人，而是奇於所記之人之事。歷史本是記人記事；所記之人之事不奇，記人記事之文又如何能奇？——除非是說史記一書听記事蹟都是謊語，全出於作者之幻想。謂司馬遷文章有奇氣，是偏重記人記事的人，而忽略了所記之人之事；是認為太史公是個奇人，而不驚歎人事之光怪陸離。這種看法對於太史公是很不利的。</p>
<p>或謂太史公若非奇人，何以漢時獨有這麼許多奇人奇事？這仍是疑太史公所記非實的另一種說法。別朝何嘗沒有奇人奇事，只是別朝的史家大都不肯或不敢坦白直率的記下來罷了。故太史公與其他史家之不同處只是：他有比一般人更豐富的正義感，於有所感，不吐不快，雖因而招禍事，亦在所不計。史記之被月為有奇氣者，原因在此；這同時也就解答了我國這類性質的所謂奇書何以只此一部。觀乎今日美國出版界「奇文」「奇書」之多遠非我國所能及，我們更可了然於一切。美國寗有如許能寫奇文的奇人？</p>
<p>故史記縱有奇氣，亦是得諸於人事之審察，是受世間奇人奇事之恩賜，非神秘地從賞玩名山大川而來。我們直可以這麼說：司馬遷之橫遭腐刑是天下一等奇事，令他遭腐刑的人纔是天下一等奇人！</p>

<p>病中偶翻報紙，見馮玉祥焚斃消息，不覺回憶此君數十年翻雲覆雨及於歷屆時局之影饗。因胃疾疲臥，每日僅稀粥一甌，神體俱困，不能執筆，近改延西醫，稍見淸爽，力疾醫之。</p>
<p>馮氏一生最驚人之表演，為民國十三年倒戈捉曹之一幕，以此留一「怖物」之印象於人間。而尤為意外者，演畢「困曹府」（兵屯九門，將曹錕禁鋼於新華宮內）之後，緊接一齣「逼淸宮」，派大隊兵士，突入故宮，將廢帝溥儀並一切宮眷全行驅遂。所以謂之意外者，溥之久居舊紫禁城，巍然高拱於民國都城之中央，對其舊臣及服官民國仍不忘情前淸榮典者，依然號令賞卹，本屬不妥，故淸除此「癌塊」，未嘗不是。惟遷溥之事，有兩個最適宜之時機，皆未舉行。一為辛亥鼎革之後，民國之初，當時所訂退位之約，原有卽令移居頤和園一條；一為丁已復辟之役，張勳以兵力擁之復位，雖可解釋為被動，然旣登其「賓座」，發布「上論」，則賣以僭妄，加以驅除，亦是名正言順。至於甲子年之奉直二次戰爭，為十一年之首次奉歡戰爭之第二幕，馮氏先則霾直討奉，繼乃反曹和率，總不外軍閥搗亂之圈子，與淸室實是風馬牛不相及，忽然被逐，倉皇狼狽，在淸帝眞有「閉門家中坐，禍從天上來」之奇突的感愴。</p>
<p>至於此舉之影響後來大局之明徵，則為九一八後之偽」滿洲國」。原來民初老袁之把溥儀留在宮中，不無深意，其時淸室舊人及宗社黨徒蠢然謀變者，不在少數，若放出城去，不啻縱虎出柙，不如圈在內外城之中心，層層城郭，不能越雷池一步。前淸之「禁城」，乃禁臣民擅入，以表皇帝之尊嚴，故曰「禁禦」。民初之「禁城」，乃禁溥氏之私出，以防架弄利用，故同於「牢禁」。旣安反側，且防後患，政治作用，頗非感情用事者所能比。</p>
<p>馮氏驅溥出宮，並不謀慮善後，　其所之。而日人則眼明手快奇貨可居，先由舊醉府迎人　交民巷，更由北京護送到津日租界，代為安置「行宮」式之居宅，使一般遺老照舊朝見外，日本領事及官僚亦照前淸兩國儀注，年節覲賀。溥氏昔在宮中之皇帝風光，僅能及於遺老，在日租界則並受日本之尊崇。如此手段，如此陰謀，局外或可看淸，當局焉得而不迷惘。日本之運動成立「滿州國」巳非一日，後朦新平氏所著鄭家屯中已詐叙資助肅王製造偽國失敗之經過。溥儀資格遠在善耆之上，故九一八事變後，土肥原卽就日租界挾之而東，直是順手牽羊，不費吹灰之力了。</p>
<p>「偽滿」成立，及於中國大局及國際之波動，為世所能詳，故不繫叙。</p>

<h3>No More Fighting in Jinan, Inside or Out; President Declares a Deadline for Recapture; He Yingqin Reports on the War Situation at the Kuomintang Central Political Committee; Air Force Fleets Continue to Bomb the Periphery of Jinan City</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] President Chiang personally presided over the Kuomintang Central Political Committee on the morning of the 27th. After Minister He Yingqin reported on the war situation, the President spoke impromptu, expressing regret over the loss of Jinan, considering it a significant loss in the suppression of the rebellion, but one that would not affect the overall military situation in the suppression campaign. The President also declared that he would immediately issue an order to recapture Jinan by a specific deadline. He's report focused on the Jinan and western Liaoning battlefields. The Jinan campaign resulted in substantial losses due to Wu Huawen's unexpected defection as the primary cause. General Wang Yaowu's loyalty and bravery were extraordinary, but news is currently cut off, and his fate is unknown. However, based on the circumstances, it is believed that Wang may have committed suicide to die for his cause. Fierce fighting continues on the western Liaoning battlefield. In addition to the military report, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shishun reported on Foreign Minister Wang's attendance at the United Nations General Assembly and China's position.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, dispatch from Xuzhou, 27th] According to an Air Force reconnaissance report, there has been no fighting inside or outside Jinan City since the afternoon of the 26th, and the city appears to have fallen into the hands of the bandits after a bloody battle. However, according to observers here, the fall of Jinan is merely the prelude to a major battle in central Shandong. National troops are currently advancing towards central Shandong in multiple directions according to prearranged plans, and a major battle may break out in early next month. It is widely believed that Chen Yi's bandit forces will suffer even more severe blows than in the Yellow River flooded area.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 27th] The Air Force's Huanghai fleet flew to Jinan in batches on the 27th, severely damaging the arsenal, Jingyi Road, ammunition depots, commercial port, and Daxin Pharmaceutical Factory in the northern part of Jinan City. All bombs hit their targets, sending up thick smoke.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 27th] The Huanghai Air Force fleet scouted the area around Jinan on the 27th, discovering a concentration of over 500 bandits at the Changqing County airfield and over 300 bandit handcarts on the Changqing-Feicheng highway, which were strafed and bombed, destroying more than half. Six hundred bandits were discovered east of Tushikou, and a low-altitude bombing and strafing run was conducted, with excellent results.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, dispatch from Xuzhou, 27th] National troops in the border area of Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, and Anhui launched a wide-ranging sweep in the southeastern region of Dangshan yesterday, with excellent results, killing or wounding over 300 bandits. There are currently no traces of bandits between Huangkou and Dangshan.</p>
<h3>Fierce Overall Battle in Western Liaoning; Focus on Jinzhou and Jinxi; Nationalist Elite Troops Airlifted for Reinforcement</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 27th] The fighting in the suburbs of Jinzhou has intensified. Air Force formations here frequently conduct reconnaissance and bombing missions to assist in the battle. An elite unit from Shenyang has been airlifted from a certain location to Jinzhou for reinforcement and has already arrived and entered its position. A bloody battle is raging north of Jinzhou. National troops are relying on hilltop fortifications to fiercely attack the invading bandits and are succeeding. The weather was clear on the 27th, and the Air Force was particularly active.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 27th] Intense fighting is taking place across western Liaoning, with the focus on Jinzhou and Jinxi. Fierce battles have broken out to the north, west, and east of Jinzhou. At Erlangdong and Daziying, seven kilometers north of the suburbs, National troops are attacking the invading bandits with combined land and air forces. The battle situation is unprecedentedly fierce, and the bandits have suffered heavy casualties. Fighting was still ongoing in this area throughout the 27th. To the east, fighting is taking place 22 kilometers away. The Shuangyangdian station on the Beining Railway is under the control of high-ground artillery fire, and casualties are also high. To the west, fighting is taking place at Sifangtai and Wanghutai, 13 kilometers away. The bandits are attempting to pass through the mountains from here to threaten the Jinzhou southwestern airfield. National troops are fiercely attacking the invading bandits, and airplanes can still take off and land freely. A major battle broke out north of Jinxi on the 27th. Several thousand bandits attacked Gaoqiao Station and Qingduizi in the morning. Another large group of bandits attacked Tasha Mountain, ten kilometers northwest of Jinxi, and a fierce battle raged all day. Although fighting has not stopped between Jinxi and Xingcheng, there have been no major changes. Naval artillery fire continues to bombard areas where bandits are concentrated. The bandit's Fourth Column, with over 10,000 troops, attacked Dangjiatun and Haojiatun, northeast of Xingcheng, at dawn on the 26th, and fighting was still ongoing on the 27th. In the Suizhong area, the fighting at the station has been the fiercest since the 25th. Most of the fortifications have been destroyed by bandit artillery fire, and the defending troops are fighting bitterly against the bandits. As for the bandits in the Yixian area northwest of Jinzhou, they have been constantly shelling the southern gate since the 26th to cover their advance, making some small progress. There are many bandits roaming in the Zhenshishan area northeast of the Daling River, possibly the main force of the First, Sixth, and Eighth Columns newly arrived from northern Liaoning, which is noteworthy. The bandits have an attempt to seize the Liaoxi Corridor with all their strength. The bandits currently fighting in the Jinzhou and Jinxi areas include the Third, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Columns, as well as the Sixth and Eighth Independent Divisions, and the Eighteenth and Twenty-First Military Subdistricts, totaling about 100,000 troops.</p>
<p>[Our Jinzhou Dispatch, 27th] The military released a statement at midnight on the morning of the 27th: (1) On the 25th and 26th, the bandit's Seventh and Ninth Columns, and bandits of unknown number, totaling approximately 30,000, launched fierce attacks on the defending troops around Jinzhou from the Jin-Yi Highway, all of which were repelled, with heavy casualties. (2) On the 25th and 26th, the outskirts of Jinzhou City were repeatedly bombed by the Air Force and continuously shelled by artillery, killing 5,000 to 6,000 bandits. (3) On the 26th, under the cover of air and artillery fire, National troops actively attacked the bandits entrenched north of Jinzhou City, capturing a large number of weapons and prisoners, including fifteen light and heavy machine guns, three hundred rifles, and over six hundred bandits. More than a thousand bandit corpses were left behind. National troops also suffered casualties. (4) The bandits in the Yixian area have made no progress since the siege began until the 26th. The garrison launched an attack on the 26th, achieving some gains. (5) In the Jinxi area, bandits harassed the defending troops twice on the 26th, but were repelled each time. (6) There was no fighting in Xingcheng and Suizhong on the 26th, and the defending troops are strengthening fortifications. (7) On the 26th, the naval fleet opened fire on the bandits entrenched in Yue Station (phonetic) east of the city, killing many bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 27th] Due to the tense situation in western Liaoning, commercial aviation operations here are being considered for temporary suspension to facilitate military aircraft takeoffs and landings.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Personnel from the Civil Aviation Corporation's Jinzhou office under the Ministry of Communications have all withdrawn to Shenyang, but air transport has not been interrupted. Officials at the temporary airfield are commuting back and forth by plane. It is possible that the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation have already withdrawn in advance.</p>
<h3>Bandits Active Again in Eastern Hebei; Pinggu Line Also Not Peaceful</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Bandits are attacking eastern Hebei again. According to the North China剿匪 Headquarters: Two bandit regiments moved from the Sanhe border area towards Yan Jiao (east of Tongxian) in the afternoon of the 26th. Contact was made around 12:00 midnight northeast of Yan Jiao. The fierce battle continued until 5:00 this morning, with many bandits killed. The fighting has temporarily ceased, and reinforcements from the National troops are arriving one after another, and will launch a pincer attack on the bandits from the north and south. Further news: A group of bandits was also discovered east of Hebei Village, southeast of Shunyi on the Pinggu Line, on the evening of the 26th. As of 11:00 this morning, fighting is still continuing.</p>
<h3>Guo Zongfen Arrives in Beiping from Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Military Reorganization Committee Changed to Military Construction Committee</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Guo Zongfen, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army Group of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, flew to Beiping from Taiyuan on the 26th. He will meet with Fu Zuoyi within days for discussions, and is scheduled to fly back to Taiyuan before the 1st of next month. It is reported that the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, in response to the current situation, has changed the Military Reorganization Committee to the Military Construction Committee, with five departments established under it: Personnel, Logistics, Political Security, Political Training, and Military Training. Yang Aiyuan is the chairman of the committee, and Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, and Guo Zongfen are members.</p>
<h3>Fighting East of Jingjiang City</h3>
<p>A Brigade Commander Under Bi Shuwen Defects to the Bandits</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 27th] Fighting broke out at Baimuqiao, four li east of Jingjiang City, from morning to evening on the 27th, and has not yet stopped. National troops have rushed to reinforce the area. Jingjiang City is safe.</p>
<p>[Our Jingjiang Dispatch, 27th] Nie Tingbin, a brigade commander of the 23rd Division stationed here, attempted to lead his troops to defect to the bandits during a troop rotation and bandit attack on Baimuqiao. His troops, fully understanding righteousness, did not obey the illegal order. Regiment Commander Cui, acting on the orders of Division Commander Bi Shuwen, disarmed the brigade headquarters. Only about 200 soldiers followed Nie Tingbin. Order has been restored in the city. Division Commander Bi has rushed over from Huangqiao to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 27th] Military sources: Reports of the fall of Yong'an Sha in Rugao have not yet been confirmed. However, all ports in Shazhou are very quiet.</p>
<h3>100,000 Japanese in Northeast; Used by the Bandits for Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch, 27th] According to Japanese recently returning from the Northeast, it is estimated that there are still 100,000 Japanese in the Northeast who are being used by the Chinese Communists, including 20,000 Japanese soldiers, who are being used by the Communist Party to fight against government troops. It is said that half of these people are already working for the Communist Party, while the other half of the Japanese are placed in harsh and isolated conditions to fend for themselves. As for skilled workers, specialized technicians, engineers, nurses, and doctors, approximately 30,000 are employed by the Communist Party, who treat them better than ordinary soldiers.</p>
<h3>War in Sui Province Nears the Provincial Capital; Bandit Army Heavily Attacks Jining, Suffering Heavy Losses; People's Armed Forces Fight Bravely, Achieving Excellent Results</h3>
<p>[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 27th] Nie Rongzhen's First and Second Columns have now crossed the Dahei River, ten kilometers south of Gui Sui, and are confronting the defending troops on the northern bank of the Xiaohei River, five kilometers south of Gui Sui. The battle for Gui Sui will begin tonight. With Deng Baoshan and Feng Qinzaizhen in charge of Baotou, morale is stable, and strong reinforcements will arrive on the evening of the 27th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The future war situation in Sui Province is worthy of attention. The bandits who have invaded Sui territory are now harassing the south of Sui in groups. Bandit leader Kang Jianmin led four cavalry and infantry regiments towards Jining on the night of the 25th, and fighting has already broken out near Jining.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] The North China剿匪 Headquarters announced: On the afternoon of the 26th, Nie Rongzhen's First, Sixth, and Second Columns, with artillery, launched a fierce attack on Jining.

<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 27th] General Zhang Zhizhong talked about his impressions of the Hexi Corridor, saying: (1) The folk customs in Hexi are simple and honest, and local leaders are united and cooperative, with excellent military-civilian cooperation. (2) The people's self-defense forces have been established, and training results and organizational spirit are good. (3) Education at all levels has shown good performance.

(5) The hardship, creativity, and democratic spirit of the employees of the Yumen Oil Mine can serve as a model for the entire country in nation-building. It is hoped that this spirit can be promoted throughout the country. (6) The people's livelihood outside the pass is difficult, and transportation is inconvenient, requiring more effort.

<h3>Guangdong Province Proceeds with Hong Kong Exchange to Purchase Rice; Song Ziwen Explains the Process; Declares That Everything Is Done with Public Funds for Official Purposes; If Any Acts of Using Public Office for Private Gain Are Found, The Death Penalty Will Be Applied</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th] Before the currency reform, the Guangdong Provincial Bank successively entered more than 590,000 Hong Kong dollars to purchase Siamese rice for allocation and sale, which caused some misunderstandings. Especially recently, people in Nanjing and Shanghai did not understand the truth, and spread rumors. Chairman Song Ziwen specifically issued an important statement, stating: Guangdong is a rice-deficient province. Last year, it suffered a flood that had not been seen in sixty years, and production was sharply reduced. This year, there is a risk of famine. Since he took office, he has purchased a large amount of grain from Hunan and Guangxi, and cooperated with US aid and grain allocated by the Ministry of Food to safely overcome the province's serious food crisis. However, there is still a shortage of food next year, and Hunan Province also suffers heavy flooding and prohibits the export of rice. In August, when he went to Nanjing, he was granted by the Ministry of Food to allocate 20,000 tons to this province within the 100,000-ton quota of rice purchased by our government from 暹. However, the central government could not provide foreign exchange, and Guangdong Province had to prepare its own foreign exchange for procurement, and it had to be purchased before the end of October this year. After he returned to Guangzhou on August 10, the Grain and Economic Committee entrusted the Guangdong Provincial Bank to successively replenish the foreign exchange entering Hong Kong. During the initial replenishment, the currency reform decree was announced, so only more than 590,000 Hong Kong dollars could be replenished, equivalent to 720 billion legal tender, which has been verified by the Guangzhou Gold Management Bureau. This is all done with public funds for official purposes. If there are any acts of private gain, which are not purchased by the Provincial Bank with grain loans, any acts of using public office for private gain, once found to be true, will be punished according to law with the death penalty.</p>

After research, it was considered inappropriate to purchase short-term Treasury bills, which will be changed to only purchasing Gold Yuan public bonds. In addition, the use of these funds for production enterprises will be limited to direct production and may not be used for loans. When there is an urgent need for turnover, the funds should still be deposited in the Central Bank after the turnover is completed. This use will only require the approval of the Central Bank. In addition, the Shanghai Silver Association's request for a flexible handling of the matter has been sent to the Ministry of Finance.

<h3>Editorial: The Berlin Crisis's Appeal to the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>The world's attention has been focused on the Moscow negotiations, which, after more than a month of continuation, finally failed due to the Soviet Union's insistence on controlling traffic to Berlin. After receiving the Soviet reply to the three powers' "final note," the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held an emergency meeting at the French Foreign Ministry. They unanimously believed that the Soviet Union had refused to lift the blockade of Berlin, and that the blockade of Berlin had created a situation that "threatened international peace and security." Therefore, they decided to appeal this serious Berlin crisis to the United Nations Security Council. Although this move was expected by the world, and UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie had already been considering "requesting the Security Council to discuss the Berlin crisis," this is the first time that the Security Council has handled a dispute between the five major powers, and whether it can resolve this issue is related to the prestige and survival of the United Nations. The third session of the United Nations General Assembly is currently being held at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, and although it is still regarded by the world as a symbol of world peace and the only hope of mankind, it is surrounded by a haze, indicating the dimness of its future. Now, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have appealed the Berlin crisis to the General Assembly, putting the United Nations to an unprecedented and severe test.</p>
<p>In our honest opinion, in the past three years, the United Nations has indeed eliminated a lot of hatred, discrimination, disputes, and wars from the post-war world. In particular, the Security Council has been more successful than it has failed. For example, the mediation of the Indonesian-Dutch conflict, the Indian-Pakistani dispute, and the Palestinian-Arab war must be said to have achieved considerable success, saving billions of people from the scourge of war. However, it must also be pointed out that the nature of the United Nations, its life, is entirely entrusted to the principle of "unanimity of the five powers." Therefore, the five permanent members of the Security Council all have the privilege of exercising the "veto power." If any one of the five powers expresses dissent and exercises its veto power, any resolution cannot be established. Therefore, the Security Council can only resolve issues that are less related to the five powers, and cannot resolve serious issues that are directly related to the interests of the five powers. The Security Council's handling of international issues over the past three years is an excellent demonstration of this. Now, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, regardless of the nature of the Security Council, have actually appealed the Berlin crisis to the General Assembly, accusing the Soviet Union of violating the Charter. Apart from causing a great uproar in the United Nations General Assembly, whether the Security Council can resolve this issue is, as everyone knows, uncertain.</p>
<p>The fact before our eyes is very clear. If the United Kingdom, the United States, and France bring the Berlin crisis to the Security Council for handling, the Soviet Union will inevitably exercise its veto power, making it impossible for the Security Council to pass any resolution. Even if this General Assembly decides on any method to restrict the exercise of the veto power, the Soviet Union will inevitably fight to the end to oppose it. In the event that the countries disregard the Soviet Union's opposition and pass a resolution to amend the United Nations Charter, the resulting outcome will inevitably lead to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the United Nations. Therefore, from any perspective, it is meaningless for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to appeal the Berlin crisis to the United Nations. It only adds a major difficulty to the United Nations, forcing the East and West blocs to face off in the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>As for the creation of the Berlin crisis, from the perspective of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the communist forces are increasingly tightening their grip to the west, and the Soviet Union has also blockaded traffic between Berlin and West Germany, which is really intolerable, so it is necessary to force the Soviet Union to lift the blockade. From the Soviet Union's perspective, the merger of the three occupation zones of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the conclusion of the West German agreement, and the reform of the West German currency system are all expressions of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism, and the blockade of Berlin must be used to counteract its effects. Standing in the position of a third party, we cannot help but say, "Each has its own reasons." The crux of the problem is the difference in thinking and the conflict of interests between the two sides. The Moscow negotiations failed after more than a month because the two sides insisted on their own positions and could not tolerate or concede to each other. As long as both sides have sincerity, opening the deadlock in negotiations is not impossible. Therefore, we believe that instead of appealing the Berlin crisis to the United Nations, it is better to seek a peaceful solution through diplomatic negotiations. Now, the international situation is critical. Western democratic countries still need greater perseverance and patience, and they must especially cherish the United Nations, which is still a symbol of world peace. Unless it is absolutely necessary, they must not force the Soviet Union to withdraw, making the United Nations only an international organization of the Western bloc. Therefore, the decision of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to appeal the Berlin issue to the United Nations is worth reconsidering.</p>

<h3>Qingdao's Grain Rationing Measures Are Improper</h3>
<p>Creating Black Market and Panic Buying</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 27th] The Qingdao Citizens' Survey Committee changed the monthly ration card to a semi-annual four-part form, resulting in the failure to distribute flour in September, even though the flour arrived early, creating a rampant black market for flour.

<h3>Bevin's Speech Responds to Vyshinsky, Denouncing Soviet Harm to Peace, Questioning the Motive Behind a Three to Four Million Strong Army</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 27th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, on the 27th, challenged the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly, demanding that the Soviet Union "show its sincerity" by revealing the true strength of its armed forces. Bevin accused the Soviet Union of professing a desire for peace while everything it did in Germany showed that its words were empty. He added, "The threat of psychological warfare is hanging over our heads." Bevin then demanded that the Soviet Union "produce the facts, give us proof of sincerity." Bevin's speech was mostly aimed at Soviet representative Vyshinsky's speech to the General Assembly last week, in which the latter claimed that the Western nations were plotting an atomic war against the Soviet Union and insisted that the Soviet Union's intentions were entirely peaceful. Bevin, turning towards Vyshinsky, exclaimed, "The Soviet Union's actions belie its words!" Bevin's speech came just hours after the West issued its strongest post-war diplomatic note to the Soviet Union, announcing that the West had decided to submit the Berlin crisis to the Security Council. Although Bevin did not specifically mention the Berlin crisis when discussing Germany, he expressed regret that the Soviet Union had refused the U.S. proposal in 1946 to sign a forty-year treaty to permanently disarm Germany. In response to Vyshinsky's proposal to reduce the armed forces of the five major powers by one-third within a year, Bevin said that no one knows the true strength of the Soviet Union's armed forces, and that only common security and confidence could promote reductions. "Mr. Vyshinsky obviously disagrees with me, so let him tell us the truth about the Soviet Union's armed forces." Bevin said, "We have learned that the Soviet Union's armed forces currently number at least three to four million people. I believe that before the war, this number was less than one million. Now, a country that is unwilling to declare its actions to the world and wants us to trust it with our security is simply not credible. In my opinion, the Soviet Union's proposal is like asking the whole world to disarm while the Soviet Union continues to conceal its military strength." The British Foreign Secretary firmly supported the Western European Union and the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan), and denied that these two agreements were aimed at the Soviet Union. "If we cannot unite the world as one family based on ideals, we must seek the next best thing, focusing on regional cooperation. We should consult with those who share our views and cooperate with those who understand and trust each other and are willing to understand and trust us." Bevin believed that a world government, which is what the world yearns for, could emerge from regional understanding. Regarding Vyshinsky's claim that the West was preparing to wage war against the Soviet Union, Bevin denounced it as "pure fiction" and "completely unfounded." He said, "What then is the purpose of the Soviet Union's psychological warfare? Mr. Vyshinsky need not answer. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union wants to trap our minds in its web. We are the ones taking a defensive stance, and we are the victims of the 'Cold War' launched by Moscow."</p>
<h3>If Atomic Catastrophe Descends, the Soviet Union Will Be Solely Responsible</h3>
<p>Bevin assured the Soviet Union that it need not fear Western attacks on Soviet territory and could enjoy peace. "We will never attack the Soviet Union. On the other hand, if the Soviet Union, after stabilizing its own country, uses the territory of other countries to prepare to attack us, a difficult situation will arise, and we will have to make plans for our own defense." He solemnly warned the world that if the world is engulfed in atomic war, the Soviet Union will be solely responsible. Regarding the United Nations' lack of achievement in controlling atomic energy, Bevin said, "I wish to state in the most solemn terms that if the catastrophe of the atomic bomb descends upon the world, all the disasters suffered by mankind should be borne entirely by one country, because that country refuses to cooperate with other countries for the sake of human happiness in controlling and developing atomic energy." Bevin also questioned whether the Soviet Union still adheres to the Marxist-Leninist view that there can be no final agreement between communist and non-communist countries. He asked whether all the actions of the Soviet government are merely a tactic, whether the Soviet government's words are appealing during the process, but its ultimate goal remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Citing Lenin's Words</p>
<p>At this point, the stout British Foreign Secretary quoted Lenin as saying that the ultimate victor would be either communism or the "capitalist countries," and that "before the end comes, there will be a series of terrible clashes between the Soviet Republic and the bourgeois states." Bevin asked, "We have been slow to accept the Soviet Union's rhetoric of international cooperation at face value. Mr. Vyshinsky should understand why in light of Lenin's words." Bevin became emotional when mentioning Vyshinsky's claim that the West was plotting an atomic war against the Soviet Union, pointing his finger at Vyshinsky and exclaiming, "This is an age-old trick. Those who accuse others must themselves have this intention and shift the responsibility to others."</p>
<p>Thunderous Applause</p>
<p>Bevin's speech was met with thunderous applause. Veterans of the General Assembly said that this was the most well-received speech in recent memory. Vyshinsky left his seat immediately after Bevin's speech, and many other chief delegates followed suit.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Should Bear Sole Responsibility for Creating the Serious Situation in Berlin: The Three Western Powers Jointly Send a Note to the Soviet Union and Simultaneously Submit a Copy to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 27th Broadcast: It is expected that the United States, Britain, and France will submit a copy of their note to the Soviet Union regarding the German question to the United Nations on the 27th, along with an urgent request to include the case on the Security Council's agenda within a few days. The note was delivered to the Soviet ambassadors to the United States and France on the night of the 26th and was sent to London on the 27th to be delivered to the Soviet ambassador to Britain.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Paris, 27th] The United States, Britain, and France delivered a twelve-page note to Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov at midnight on the 26th (Paris time). The note includes the following thirteen points: (1) The Soviet Union's measures in Berlin to obstruct the Western powers' supply of occupation forces are sufficient to threaten Berlin residents with starvation and economic ruin. (2) The Western powers cannot accept measures that infringe on their rights in Berlin but are prepared to accept practical measures that are consistent with their rights and obligations in Berlin.</p>
<p>(3) During the Moscow negotiations, an agreement was reached on lifting the Berlin blockade and placing the Soviet mark under four-power control. (4) Stalin stated that all restrictions mentioned on June 18 would be lifted, and the Four-Power Financial Committee would have the right to control the German banks in the Soviet zone, as these banks are related to the business of the entire city of Berlin. (5) The instructions given by the four-power governments to their four military governors in Berlin were based on the results of the meeting with Stalin, but the Soviet commander in Germany did not comply with these instructions. He demanded restrictions on the Berlin airlift and refused to recognize the Financial Committee's right to control the issuance of banknotes. He also demanded that trade between Berlin and other areas be placed under Soviet control. (6) The Soviet authorities allowed demonstrations aimed at overthrowing the Berlin municipal government. (7) On September 14, the representatives of the three Western powers drew the Soviet government's attention to the fact that the Soviet commander in Berlin had not paid attention to the Moscow agreement. (8) In its note to the three powers on September 14, the Soviet Union still supported the position of its commander in Berlin regarding the powers of the airlift, trade, and financial committee. (9) On September 22, the three powers asked the Soviet government whether it intended to remove the Berlin blockade, stating that if the Soviet Union disregarded the previous agreement and decided to harm the rights of the three Western powers in Berlin, then continued negotiations would be pointless. (10) The three powers considered the Soviet Union's reply on September 25 to be unsatisfactory. The Soviet Union made conditional concessions on the control of Berlin, and its promises to control air transport and trade permits were deceptive. The Soviet government wanted to regain control of air passenger and cargo transport, which indicated that the Soviet Union had the right to restrict air transport between Berlin and the Western zones. If air transport was at the Soviet Union's disposal, then the Soviet Union could implement a blockade at any time in the future. (11) The recent encouragement by the Soviet commander in Berlin to overthrow the Berlin municipal government and his attitude towards negotiations proved that the Soviet government had not implemented the agreement and wanted to harm the rights of the three Western powers in Berlin. (12) The Berlin problem is not a technical problem. This proves that the Soviet government is attempting to achieve its political goals by illegal means, in other words, attempting to seize complete control of Berlin's economic, political, and social life and merge it into the Soviet occupation zone. (13) In this situation, the Soviet Union should bear full responsibility for the situation that cannot be resolved by invoking Article 33 of the United Nations Charter. This situation is creating adverse consequences that threaten peace and international security. Therefore, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in order to maintain their rights in Berlin, are currently taking measures that they deem necessary to maintain their position in Berlin. They feel obligated to submit this action by the Soviet government to the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department Publishes White Paper, Revealing the Breakdown of Negotiations; Soviet Union Violates Promises and Disregards Diplomatic Credibility</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department released a 24,000-word "White Paper" on the 27th, detailing the fruitless four-power negotiations on the Berlin problem and how the Soviet Union broke Premier Stalin's guarantee to lift the blockade. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and France have submitted the Berlin problem to the United Nations and jointly sent a note to the Soviet Union, believing that the Berlin problem is a definite threat to world peace.</p>
<p>The "U.S. White Paper" is the longest and most complete record of any negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. It emphasized the fact that the Soviet Union had agreed in principle to lift the blockade, but the Soviet military governor in Berlin "took a position contrary to the clear assurances given by Stalin in Moscow." No official explanation has been given for the Soviet Union's sudden change of attitude. However, it is obvious that this was either because Stalin rescinded his guarantee or because the all-powerful Soviet Politburo overturned Stalin's order.</p>
<p>The State Department's White Paper stated that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and the British and French envoys emphasized "the extreme danger of the Berlin situation" at their first meeting with Stalin on August 2. At the end of the four-hour meeting, the three Western powers believed that a solution to the Berlin dispute could be reached because Stalin had made it clear that the Soviet Union had no intention of "driving the Allies out of Berlin." However, this optimism disappeared during several meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. When negotiations were on the verge of failure, the Western powers again sought a meeting with Stalin, which was held on August 23 at the Kremlin. At this meeting, progress was made in the negotiations, and an agreement in principle to lift the blockade was reached a week later, with the "technical issues" being left to the four-power military governors in Berlin to study.</p>
<p>The White Paper described the circumstances of Stalin's proposal of the above agreement at this meeting carefully and in detail. The document stated that before Stalin withdrew, Ambassador Smith specifically used this opportunity to raise a clear and definite question, hoping to obtain a precise explanation of the Soviet Union's position. Stalin then agreed to issue instructions to the Soviet military governor in Berlin to lift all restrictions on the Western powers. "Based on this understanding, which was personally confirmed by Stalin, instructions were finally issued to the four-power military governors in Berlin to draft a technical agreement.</p>
<p>After the negotiations moved to Berlin, the Western powers immediately discovered that Soviet military governor Marshal Sokolovsky was not prepared to implement the understanding reached in the Moscow talks. Moreover, he not only did not reduce the restrictions on land transport, but also added new restrictions to the existing air transport. Therefore, Marshal Sokolovsky in Berlin took a position completely contrary to the clear assurances given by Stalin in Moscow on the three issues of transport restrictions, currency, and trade. Moreover, he constantly expressed many attitudes that were insignificant to the success or failure of the negotiations. The one-week technical discussion in Berlin was even more fruitless than the one-month negotiations in Moscow.</p>
<p>After several subsequent Moscow meetings that had no hope of success, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France sent notes to the Soviet ambassadors in their respective capitals on September 22, asking the Soviet Union to answer "whether it is prepared to immediately lift the blockade measures." However, the Soviet Union evaded the question in its reply on the 25th and instead blamed the Western powers for the failure of the negotiations, claiming that "establishing the Soviet occupation forces' control over air cargo and passenger transport is as necessary as controlling railway, waterway, and highway transport." The secret negotiations between the four powers, which began on July 30, finally failed. This showed that the West's attempt to ease tensions between East and West through secret diplomacy had come to an end.</p>
<p>The process of the four-power negotiations on the Berlin problem as cited in the White Paper is as follows:</p>
<p>July 20: U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith visited the Kremlin and suggested "a frank and open review" with Stalin and Molotov of the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade.</p>
<p>July 21: Western envoys met with Molotov separately to attempt to meet with Stalin in person.</p>
<p>August 2: First meeting with Stalin. Smith pointed out that the situation in Berlin was "extremely serious," but the Western countries "did not want" to believe that the Soviet Union intended to drive the Allies out of Berlin. Stalin asserted that this was not the Soviet Union's purpose but believed that the Western countries no longer had the legal right to occupy Berlin. He claimed that the blockade was necessary because the Western countries planned to establish a West German government and introduce West German currency into Berlin. Stalin suggested removing the Western currency from Berlin and gradually lifting all traffic restrictions in Berlin. The United States, Britain, and France believed that the Berlin crisis could be resolved.</p>
<p>August 6, 9, 12, 16: After holding several meetings with Molotov, attempting to draft an agreement based on the principles discussed with Stalin, optimistic hopes faded.</p>
<p>August 23: Second meeting with Stalin. An agreement was reached in principle. Stalin said that the Soviet Union did not object to the Western Allies remaining in Berlin, and the Western Allies could share the control of the German government in Berlin with the Soviet Union. After the four-power military governors in Berlin studied the technical issues, the blockade could be lifted. Stalin also agreed to instruct Marshal Sokolovsky to lift all restrictions on the Western countries.</p>
<p>July 31: Technical discussions began in Berlin and continued for a week, but Sokolovsky was clearly unwilling to implement the understanding reached in Moscow. During the consultations, he not only did not reduce traffic restrictions but also increased them. In addition, he also canceled the four-power control of currency.</p>
<p>September 14: The three governments complained bitterly in a supplementary memorandum to Stalin and Molotov. The memorandum specifically pointed out that there was no mention of restricting air transport in the Moscow meeting and instructions. The memorandum also notified the Soviet Union in an irritating tone that "the purpose of the instructions was to lift restrictions, not to add new restrictions."</p>
<p>September 18: The Soviet government replied to the Western countries, claiming that they had "distorted" the instructions and that Sokolovsky was completely accurate. The Soviet government also cited the so-called resolution of the Berlin Control Committee of November 30, 1945, to support its demand to control Berlin air transport.</p>
<p>September 22: The Western countries firmly stated that they could not accept any restrictions imposed on air transport and asked the Soviet Union to clarify whether it was prepared to lift the blockade in order to "create possible conditions for continued negotiations."</p>
<p>September 25: The Soviet Union replied to the three countries, believing that the agreement reached in Moscow must be implemented and insisting that "air transport cannot but be controlled."</p>
<p>September 26: The Western countries notified the Soviet Union that they had submitted the Berlin problem to the United Nations Security Council to "prevent further crises of international peace and security."</p>

<h3>Authorities Strictly Prevent Gold and Dollar Flight, Conduct Surprise Checks on Train Passengers, Factory Manager Detained with $30,000 USD, Sent to the Gold Control Bureau for Interrogation, Over 30 Cases Uncovered, All Ordered to Exchange</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] To cooperate with economic inspection work and prevent the outflow of gold and US dollars, yesterday morning, station master Li Ruhe led more than a hundred railway police officers, along with stationed military police and stationed personnel of the Suppression and Reconstruction Brigade, to conduct surprise general inspections of passengers on the Victory and Express trains. They uncovered over 30 cases of carrying US dollars out of the country, totaling more than 30,000 US dollars. The largest case involved 30,000 US dollars, found in a suitcase carried by a passenger wearing a light blue suit on the Express train. Due to the large amount, the railway police detained the passenger and took him to the police station for questioning. He claimed to be Wei Jiaxiu from Jinan, Shandong, the deputy manager of the Xuzhou branch of the Baoxing Flour Mill in Shanghai, and that the US dollars were being brought from the Shanghai factory to the Bengbu branch. When asked about their purpose, he was evasive and unable to answer. Considering the significant suspicion, the railway bureau consulted the supervisor's office and, at 1:30 PM, transferred the person, the money, and the case file to the supervisor's office of the Central Bank. Supervisor Jiang approved the transfer to the Gold Control Bureau for interrogation. Other passengers carrying dozens or hundreds of US dollars were persuaded by the inspectors to exchange their foreign currency for gold yuan at the Central Bank, and the railway bureau provided them with ticket refund benefits. (Note: Regulations for reserved-seat trains such as the Victory and Express trains do not allow ticket refunds.) Tang Wengeng, an employee of the Nanjing Materials Factory under the Second District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, who was returning to Nanjing by train, was also found to have two US dollars hidden on his person. Because the amount was too small and he did not want to delay his journey, he asked the railway police to exchange the two US dollars for gold yuan and donate them to a charity. The railway bureau police station immediately sent the money to the Caohejing Orphan and Refugee Relief Center in the afternoon. Another high-ranking diplomat stationed abroad also presented 220 US dollars, entrusting the inspectors to exchange them for gold yuan, and the police station issued a receipt, allowing him to claim the funds in the future. Afterwards, according to a spokesperson for the railway bureau police station, the railway bureau had never previously conducted general inspections of passengers. This time, after repeated discussions between police station chief Wang and the inspection personnel in charge, it was decided to adopt surprise inspections. Under the premise of not hindering the convenience of passenger travel, these surprise inspections will be carried out at any time in the future. Starting from the first of next month, if anyone is found to be carrying gold or US dollars out of the country, in addition to the confiscation of the gold and US dollars, the carrier will be transferred to the supervisor's office for severe punishment without leniency.</p>
<h3>Suspicion of Smuggling US Dollars Out of the Country, Hu Hao Flees Shanghai to Hong Kong, Authorities Unable to Arrest</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Economic Management Supervisor's Office in this city confirmed at 7:00 PM yesterday that Hu Hao (i.e., Hu Weizhi) had already flown to Hong Kong in the early morning. Personnel from the office stated, "The supervisor's office issued an arrest warrant for Hu Hao at 10:00 AM, on suspicion of smuggling US dollars to Hong Kong. However, Hu Hao had already flown to Hong Kong in the early morning, allowing him to escape. The circumstances are quite complex, and the relevant authorities are now trying to bring Hu Hao to justice."</p>
<p>Permission Obtained for Trip to Hong Kong</p>
<p>It is learned that Hu Hao's departure from Shanghai to Hong Kong, in terms of formalities, had been previously applied for a permit from the Garrison Headquarters by Zheng Yuangui, the acting manager of the Shanghai office of Tiger Balm Wing On Tong, who has been arrested. The reason given was "Mr. Hu Hao, the general manager of this company, has completed his work in Shanghai and is returning to Hong Kong." After review by the headquarters, it was approved on the 20th of this month, with a validity date until yesterday. Therefore, although Hu was questioned and inspected by the inspectors stationed at the airport before boarding yesterday morning, he was still able to leave calmly due to having complete paperwork. After Hu left Shanghai, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) immediately sent the stub of the permit to the Garrison Headquarters for cancellation. At about 10:00 AM, the police station received an arrest warrant and sent personnel to arrest him for interrogation. By this time, Hu had already left for two hours. Afterwards, the police station summoned Qin Shuxian, the deputy director of the CNAC ticket office, for questioning.</p>
<p>No Name on Passenger List</p>
<p>Furthermore, after this news spread, someone called CNAC to inquire whether Hu Hao had left Shanghai. However, according to the company, there was no person named Hu Hao on today's passenger list to Hong Kong. Whether Hu Hao used another name to board the plane, or whether there was another problem with the permit, has become another mystery.</p>
<p>Original Stolen Goods Not Missing</p>
<p>(Another report) Yesterday's newspaper reported that when the original stolen US dollars were counted after being retrieved from the custody of acting manager Zheng Yuangui, it was discovered that 185 US dollars were missing. Yesterday morning, after section chief Jiang handed over the total amount to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for a second count, there were no shortages, indicating that the initial count was done in haste and was incorrect. After confessing to the theft, Zheng was transferred by the branch office to the District Prosecutor's Office in the afternoon for investigation.</p>
<p>[Another report] According to sources, it was reported that Hu Hao's younger brother, Hu Wen, intended to bring 29,000 US dollars to Hong Kong when he flew to Hong Kong on the 24th. However, due to strict military and police inspections at the time, he did not take them. Soon after, the US dollars were reported stolen. The circumstances are quite suspicious. According to the relevant source, this may be a pre-arranged diversion. However, according to Wing On Tong yesterday, the person who flew to Hong Kong on the 24th was not Hu Jiao, but Hu Hao's youngest brother, Hu Yihu, and he had no intention of taking money out of the country.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Retailers Request Direct Delivery</h3>

On the 14th of this month, the Changshu Road police branch received a report and went to investigate. After being handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation, Zhou claimed that he was indeed a merchant formally engaged in the flour business.

<h3>Yi Da Chang Money Exchange Operates Illegally, Ordered to Close and Revoke License, Managing Director and Manager Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>According to news from the Gold Control Bureau, Yi Da Chang Money Exchange in this city was found to have established secret accounts and concealed income during the bureau's previous audit, violating regulations. The bureau reported this to the Ministry of Finance, which ordered the board of directors of the exchange to replace the responsible personnel and imposed a fine of 2,106,000 yuan. The exchange then replied that the deputy director of operations and the accountant had been replaced, and the fine had been submitted. The Ministry of Finance then ordered the bureau to continue to pay attention to the exchange's operations at any time to see if there were any further illegal operations. On the 19th of this month, the bureau secretly sent personnel to seize all the evidence of illegal activities, including more than 16 taels of gold, one gold bracelet, two diamond rings, eleven secret ledgers, and a written statement from Yan Dayou, the managing director of the exchange, and He Jinyuan, the manager, guaranteeing the operation of secret accounts. After detailed review by the bureau, it was found to have violated Articles 17 and 43 of the Banking Law, Articles 6 and 10 of the Measures for Strengthening Financial Operations, and Article 29, Paragraph 2 of the Measures for Streamlining Finances and Strengthening Economic Control, as well as Article 1 of the Regulations on Punishment for the Purchase and Sale of Gold and Foreign Currency. The bureau reported this to the Economic Control Supervisor for approval, ordering the exchange to close immediately, suspending its clearing of checks from the 28th of this month, revoking its exchange number, setting a deadline for clearing creditor and debtor rights and obligations, and reporting to the ministry to revoke its business license. The responsible parties in this case, Yan Dayou, the managing director of the exchange, He Jinyuan, the manager, and Chen Renben, an employee, have been sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action.</p>
<p>Serious Circumstances, Severe Investigation</p>
<p>According to Director Lin of the bureau, the simultaneous punishment and closure of the three banks of Datong, Dagong, and Nongshang and the Tongyi Trust Company was unprecedented in Shanghai. This was considered several times beforehand, because the economic control policy was just beginning. In order to prevent chaos, management had to be strict, but the licenses were not immediately revoked. A decision on whether to resume operations will be made depending on the severity of the illegal circumstances determined by the court and the quality of the liquidation. The Yi Da Chang Money Exchange case is serious, especially since it continued to violate the law after the currency reform. Therefore, it was decided to investigate severely and report to the Ministry of Finance to revoke its business license.</p>

<h3>The Zhoushan Islands Campaign, Nine Warships Deployed, Clearing and Suppressing Each Island, Many Plunder Captured, Hospitals and Factories Discovered on the Mountains</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The bandits' weapons and local forces of the Second Security Corps colluding with the bandits captured during the campaign by Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing to personally suppress the bandit dens in the Zhoushan Islands have been escorted to Shanghai by the Zhonghai and Zhongji warships. The Headquarters of the First Naval District specially invited the press to visit yesterday. Most of the captured bandits are local natives. Among them, Wang Hesheng, the deputy commander of the bandit maritime defense brigade, Diao Quanyou, the company commander, and Huang Weiluan, the instructor, were in higher positions. When asked how they became bandits, they either claimed that they had no means of living or falsely claimed that they were forced to participate. According to the bandit documents seized, their designation was "Zhoushan Islands Guerrilla Detachment Headquarters, East Sea Guerrilla General Team." The commander was Xu Xiaoyu, the deputy commander was Li Zhaoxiang, the general team leader was Jiang Zhiming, and the political director was Xiao Hua. All four of these bandit leaders had already fled to other places about 20 days before the suppression. The bandit maritime defense brigade commander Wang Rongxuan below the general team level was executed on the spot after being arrested. He Xiangchen, a colonel battalion commander of the 3rd Guard Battalion of the Naval Headquarters who commanded the landing and suppression of the bandits, reported the process of the suppression, stating that the forces participating this time included two platoons of the naval guard battalion, one company of the Marine Corps, and one battalion of the Army's 202nd Division. Nine warships and landing craft participated, including the Zhongji, Zhonghai, Yongxing, Liangguang, Xinyang, Meisheng, and small gunboats Fang 1, Fang 4, and Hai 7. They departed from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 8th of this month and arrived at Dongfushan, where the main force of the bandits was located, at dawn on the 9th. They immediately surrounded it and, under the cover of naval artillery fire, forcibly landed. The bandits stubbornly resisted from high ground, and after fierce fighting, the island was completely occupied at 3:50 PM. Hospitals, small factories, and large amounts of stored food were discovered on the mountain. Then, the bandits on the Changtushan, Daishan, Qushan, Waiheng, Changbaishan, Xiushan, and Dayushan islands in the Zhoushan Islands, which were occupied by the bandits, were successively suppressed, and all were occupied by the 25th. In this campaign, 185 bandits were captured, along with 3 light machine guns, 131 rifles, 19 pistols, and 1,216 rounds of ammunition. Many documents relating to communication with the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu and the "Shao" character flag that could be used to travel to northern Jiangsu were also seized. In addition to Wang Rongxuan, the company commander Fang Pengcheng, Mei Chengfei, Zhang Chenghu, and the platoon leaders Zhang Ziqiang, Lin Jiexin, and the secretary Dai Aifu were executed on the spot. In addition, because the local Second Security Corps was suspected of colluding with the bandits, Staff Officer Pang from the Ministry of National Defense was dispatched to investigate and verify the facts. They were disarmed and resolved, capturing 244 people, 86 rifles, 2 light machine guns, 6 pistols, and 950 rounds of ammunition. The 202nd Division of the Youth Army is now stationed there, and a Marine Corps unit is stationed in Dinghai Shenjiamen for defense. The local county government is ordered to implement the Baojia system effectively in order to eradicate the bandit scourge.</p>

<h3>Sale of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate: First Batch to be Announced Tomorrow; He Hao Ruo Clarifies Government's Determination to Expedite Handling; Original Residents Given 10-Day Priority Purchase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] He Hao Ruo, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 26th to oversee and expedite the handling of enemy and puppet properties. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, he convened a meeting at the Central Bank conference room, inviting relevant authorities including Jiang Jingyuan, Liu Yiyun, Cheng Yuanfan, Luo Meizhong, Li Lixia, Shen Guanya, and Zhang Zihe. The following decisions were made: (1) The first batch of 79 enemy and puppet real estate properties, totaling over 100 buildings, will be announced for sale tomorrow (29th). Original residents will have a 10-day priority purchase period, after which the properties will be openly auctioned. Original residents must vacate before Double Tenth Day (October 10th). Failure to purchase or vacate will result in enforcement. (2) The order of sale will be: (a) Garden villas, (b) Warehouses and buildings, (c) Lane houses. Furthermore, Mr. He hosted a reception for the local press at the National Bank conference room yesterday afternoon and returned to Nanjing last night. Mr. He listed five points during the discussion, excerpts of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Finding an Outlet for Idle Capital</p>
<p>(1) Expediting the sale of enemy and puppet properties is an economic method to find an outlet for idle capital. (2) Selling enemy and puppet materials can reduce idle capital and stabilize prices. In Shanghai alone, enemy and puppet properties allocated as reserve for the Gold Yuan are valued at US$41,108,890.94. If sold entirely, it could recover 164,435,563.72 Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>Selling Garden Villas First</p>
<p>(3) The government's current handling method, as decided by the Executive Yuan's 9th temporary meeting on September 25th, is as follows: 1. Enemy and puppet real estate will be valued at market price, and residents will be notified and given 10 days to purchase. They must pay half of the guarantee deposit, with the remainder to be paid within one month from the date of notification. Failure to pay on time will result in forfeiture of the guarantee deposit. Failure to purchase within 10 days will be considered a waiver, and the property will be put up for open bidding. 2. Once enemy and puppet real estate is sold, residents must relocate within one month to allow for handover to the winning bidder. Those who delay will be forcibly evicted by the Economic Supervisory Office. According to this method, we will start with the garden villas of large and wealthy households. Although all people are equal before the law, we must start with those who are powerful and in high positions. We believe that no one will neither purchase nor relocate. If there is such a person, whether they are a military or government official, a powerful merchant, or a social celebrity, we will follow the government's regulations and have military police throw their belongings onto the street, evict their families, and enforce the order. This is a government decree, and it is not the intention of the enforcement agency to be malicious. When dealing with enemy and puppet properties, we must consider civil servants and ordinary poor people who are currently living in enemy and puppet properties with diligence and frugality, sacrificing for the country, and who are helpless. We hope to handle this in a reasonable and lawful manner.</p>
<p>It's a Good Investment</p>
<p>(4) Purchasing enemy and puppet properties is a good investment and helps the government to reduce idle capital, stabilize prices, and benefit the general public. (5) The government is determined to handle enemy and puppet materials legally, reasonably, openly, and quickly. I am ordered to oversee the handling of this business and will complete the task regardless of any difficulties. It has been decided to convene a meeting of responsible persons from various regions in Nanjing on October 1st, and invite personnel from relevant agencies to participate in an open review. In addition to visiting Pingjin, Qingdao, and other places for guidance, I will also come to Shanghai every two weeks to listen to opinions from all parties. I hope that public opinion organs will supervise, and the media will assist.</p>
<h3>City Council Cash Group Revises Transportation Company Share Offering Method</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Public Law and Regulations Committees of the City Council held a joint meeting yesterday. Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue attended. The meeting immediately revised and passed the share offering method for the Public Transportation Company.

<h3>Huang Zongyi and Other Traitor Cases: Suzhou High Court Investigates Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou 27th Dispatch] The case of Huang Zongyi, Huang Baozhen, Zhang Qiangsheng, Ning Yupei, Chen Jusheng, and other traitors from the Shanghai Pudong Huazhong Alcohol Factory was investigated by the Shanghai High Court for over a year, but no conclusion was reached. Recently, the Ministry of Justice ordered the transfer of jurisdiction to the High Court here for continued investigation. This afternoon, Prosecutor Li Shudong summoned the defendants and related individuals Li Pengqing, Liu Niangu, Luo Weilian, Chen Fuzeng, Qu Qingqiu, and Yu Zhikuan to court for the first hearing, which lasted three hours. The defendants were released on bail pending trial.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender Bondholders Call for Higher Redemption Rate</h3>
<p>Legal tender bondholders in this city believe that legal tender bonds and foreign currency bonds are both national debts, but the Executive Yuan's handling methods treat them very differently, which is unfair and unreasonable. In addition to jointly appointing representatives to petition the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan to improve the situation, they also hosted a press conference yesterday afternoon to make a public appeal. According to Song Xiemingjiu, chairman of the bondholder representatives, the Executive Yuan's announced handling method for national debts stipulates that the principal and interest of legal tender bonds that have already been drawn will be redeemed at a rate of one legal tender to one Gold Yuan. The principal of bonds that have not been drawn will be redeemed in advance at a multiple, and the interest coupons of bonds that have not been drawn will be handled in the same way as the principal and interest of bonds that have already been drawn. All legal tender bondholders believe that this method is too unreasonable. Finally, he also expressed absolute support for the authorities' economic reform policies, but hoped that the government would continue to use 5.5 trillion Gold Yuan to reorganize the national debt and improve the redemption rate of legal tender bonds based on the principle of reorganizing national debt, by changing all foreign currency bonds to be redeemed according to the "August 19th" National Bank exchange rate (i.e., 487,000 legal tender to one US dollar) to maintain public confidence and show fairness.</p>

<p>The registration forms were all issued yesterday and will be returned today. The deadline is 5:00 PM on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Weak Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was still weak due to the urging of inventory registration, and people were apprehensive. Most platform traders watched the trend, but local demand was still hot, and the market was mediocre.</p>
<p>Various grades of fine yarn, such as 42-count, 40-count, and 32-count, were not actively supplied in the market, and prices remained firm. 21-count Double Horse opened at 783 yuan, and many intermediate sales occurred. The market turned soft, and the downward trend was very strong. It closed at 760 yuan, a decrease of 23 yuan. Various grades of 20-count did not show any gains or losses, 16-count also remained at the original level, and the downward trend of 10-count 童子軍 was also strong, closing at 583 yuan, 17 yuan lower than last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Brisk Cloth Sales</h3>
<p>In the midst of the inventory registration deadline, the cloth market turned weak, and quotations were generally lower than on Saturday.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth retreated from 26 yuan 6 jiao to 26 yuan 1 jiao, and recovered to 26 yuan 4 jiao at closing, a decrease of 3 jiao compared to Saturday. Wu Fu 福 and Laba Tong fine cloth each decreased by 4 jiao. Longtou B fine cloth retreated from 24 yuan 8 jiao to 24 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Sijunzi Yuan Biji revolved in a stable range and finally closed at 27 yuan 6 jiao, a decrease of 1 jiao. Products such as Tiao Li, Leifeng Pagoda, Yi Yi, Jinlian Miaowu, and Sijunzi white printed Biji were all traded. The total turnover of the city was 3,700 pieces.</p>
<h3>Joint Purchase of National Cotton Funds</h3>
<p>Private Sector Subscribes 25 Million</p>
<p>The Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai held a meeting of private sector member representatives yesterday to discuss matters related to the joint purchase of national cotton. It was resolved that the private sector would subscribe 25 million Gold Yuan and a distribution method based on the number of spindles was drafted. However, each factory felt that the turnover funds were not very complete and that the payment date for the joint purchase funds was too urgent, so they planned to request an extension.</p>
<h3>Mediocre Rayon Trading</h3>
<p>The rayon market saw sparse trading and a mediocre trend yesterday. The local silk weaving industry had sufficient distribution of goods, so their appetite was very weak. Silk shops' retail sales were still familiar, and goods were still going well. There were not many Japanese goods from familiar channels offered on the market, and customers' intentions were also weak. No trading was opened for 120-count Tianqiao Jin Sanma Dongyang, and limited trading was made for various miscellaneous brands as limited.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry's Deposits and Foreign Exchange Assets Abroad</h3>
<p>Deadline for Declaration and Registration by the End of September</p>
<p>The Municipal Government approved the Finance Ministry's telegram, stating: "Following the Executive Yuan's instructions, Article 5 of the Regulations for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Stored Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China stipulates that citizens of the Republic of China, except for those who habitually live and reside abroad and should be regarded as overseas Chinese, should declare and register their foreign exchange assets stored abroad as of August 20, 1948, with the Central Bank or its entrusted banks before December 31, 1948, in accordance with the prescribed form. For foreign exchange assets acquired after August 21, 1948, they should be declared and registered within two months from the date of acquisition.</p>
<p>Now, it is necessary to declare and register all foreign exchange assets owned by domestic banks and money shops; it is specifically stipulated that the banking industry must declare and register its foreign exchange assets stored abroad before September 30, 1948. Those who fail to declare when they should, or who make false declarations, will be deemed to have violated economic control laws, and their business licenses will be revoked or suspended.</p>
<p>Those who violate the provisions of Article 8 of the same regulations, and who, from August 20, 1948, intend to avoid declaration and registration by transferring foreign exchange assets to any natural person, legal person, or other organization abroad, will be severely punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the same regulations and Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing the National Mobilization Law, in addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered to forward and comply," It is heard that the municipal government has instructed the relevant bureaus to supervise separately, and the various banks and firms in the city must strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Stable Rice Prices, Stalled Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market remained stable, with almost no fluctuations in prices. There was a relatively large supply of indica rice on the market, but there was still a lack of high-quality japonica rice, and prices were very stable. Yesterday's arrivals were 2,203 stones in the South City Market and 1,119 stones in the North City Market, totaling 3,322 stones in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Trading is difficult to develop because factories only allocate sales to retailers, and wholesalers have no goods to obtain, resulting in no goods being supplied to the market, and the market is at a standstill. In addition, the flour allocation method has been changed to once every three days, for 60 bags, which is equivalent to 20 bags per household per day.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Firm sales, arrivals are becoming scarcer, resulting in few suppliers. Soybean prices stand at the limit, trading is quiet, and raw peanuts have slightly increased trading.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Trending firmer because all grains have reached their limits, people's minds have turned firm, and supplies from households are becoming scarcer. Soybean oil factories have slightly opened up, and prices have increased by 5 jiao. Raw vegetable oil is at its highest price of 46 yuan, also up 5 jiao. Raw oil remains stable throughout. Soybean cake customers are purchasing, and factories are opening at 4 yuan 6 jiao, 100 pieces per household.</p>

<h3>Whether Overseas Chinese Investment is Overseas Remittance Requires Two Types of Proof</h3>
<p>Local Consulate and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</p>
<p>According to Mr. Sun Zhongyue, Deputy Secretary of the Import Control Commission, the three methods for importing materials with self-provided foreign exchange have been drafted by the Import Control Commission and are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (1) Regarding the method for applying to withdraw foreign orders with paid prices, the main point is that materials purchased before August 19 may be allowed to be imported. (2) As for the methods for overseas Chinese capital and domestic investment in domestic production businesses, the previous methods are being revised due to the issuance of the Economic Emergency Decree. Currently, only the overseas Chinese investment item, how to prove that it is an overseas remittance, is being determined. For strict consideration, it has been decided that not only the local consulate's explanation is required, but also the approval of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Its investment in domestic production businesses must also have the approved production plan from the relevant domestic authorities. Due to the above procedures, there are not many applications for overseas Chinese investment at present. (3) After two meetings and discussions, the Central Bank's method for foreign currency payment and the implementation rules for import are designed to be simple and strict to facilitate the application of foreign currency holders.</p>

<p>The 20th term Taiwan Red Warehouse receipt inherited the weak trend of last Saturday, and people's minds were still soft. It did not see any improvement after opening. Later, due to the continued hot sales in the local area, and due to rumors that the current term of the combined sugar company was selling only coarse sand, and there was not much spot goods on the market, people's minds tightened slightly, and quotations increased slightly. It closed at 24 yuan 7 jiao, and medium and coarse sand also saw an increase.</p>

<h3>On the View of Poetry</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>"Seen horizontally, it's a ridge; seen sideways, it's a peak; the view of a mountain differs from near and far." Although this saying points out how easily one can be misled, it still offers some standard. Something that appears as a ridge from one perspective might not necessarily be so from another. The eye's perception of objective reality holds some degree of accuracy. However, when it comes to poetry, the matter becomes far more complex. If you see a ridge, I might insist on seeing a peak, and I could argue with you from my own standpoint, even scolding you. And if we both agree on "ridge," others might scold us for simply buzzing around like flies following someone else's trash. Look, "Li and Du's poems have been passed down for ages, yet now they feel stale," "forecasting five hundred years of novelty, by a thousand years it feels old!" That's the limit! This "novelty" leaves us ordinary people utterly helpless.</p>
<p>Whether your own poetry possesses novelty is a separate issue. In fact, if your work lacks "freshness," you're unlikely to find patrons and might as well plaster it on the outhouse wall. My point here concerns our perception of other people's, even ancient, poetry. To discern a glimmer of novelty, regardless of whether that novelty genuinely reflects the "original intention" of the ancients or others, and to articulate it convincingly enough to win others over—that's a real challenge. I've studied Chinese literary history for a couple of decades, and it always boils down to the same old stuff: "Jiao Han and Dao Shou," "Du Ling's poetic history"—stale grains and rancid oil, day-old fried dough sticks, utterly lacking in "new flavor"! Even literary critics merely copy passages from Biographies of Literary Figures, Biographies of Confucians, Poetry Talks, Lyric Talks, and Literary Criticisms. In the past, Chinese poets or scholars often wrote a volume or two of ××Xuan ××Zhai Poetry Talks on the side, as a kind of "tailpiece" to their collected works. These mostly consist of rehashing what others have said, or of praising fellow disciples, flattering friends, or promoting relatives. The renowned Suiyuan Poetry Talks, while containing some worthwhile points, are also sickeningly effusive in their praise of female disciples. Some even promote themselves, which is even worse. If we, in literary history or criticism, treat these works as definitive sources, we're bound to produce something of little value!</p>
<p>Recently, I read Wen Yiduo's Miscellaneous Essays on Tang Poetry, which finally satisfied my long-felt craving. He absolutely refuses to parrot clichés, just to fill space and count the words as an essay. Nor does he copy and quote extensively from old books, add a beginning and end, say a few trivial things, and then consider it his own monumental work. In his "The Self-Redemption of Palace Style Poetry," we can see how poetry evolved from the Six Dynasties to the Tang. What role did Liu Xiyi, Zhang Ruoxu, and Lu Zhaolin play in the early Tang style? Saying it this way is vastly different from Chen Zi'ang and Wei Zheng's usual way of teaching early Tang poetry. Even among the Four Paragons of the Early Tang, he discerns differences and points out the inappropriateness of lumping together two groups with different personalities. These discussions don't use the traditional method of stuffing knowledge into your head like a textbook, but rather lead you with emotion, compelling you to follow his train of thought. When poetic criticism reaches this level, it can be said to be a good poem in itself. And in his two short pieces on Meng Haoran and Jia Dao, we seem to see the "untamed spirit" of old Mr. Meng living the life of a recluse on Deer Gate Mountain in Xiangyang. I suspect Mr. Wen, being a fellow Hubei native, feels a special affinity for him, and thus transforms this poet "discarded by an unwise monarch" into something of a celestial being? The Jia Dao piece begins with great humor, analyzing the poetic schools of the mid- and late Tang as a private school with several teachers and students, some cursing in the streets, others diligently preparing for the big exams, and still others grumbling, all in a heated state. The former Buddhist monk Jia Langxian allows these dazed fellows to rest in the shadows, and thus he triumphs.</p>
<p>In traditional literary history, we always regret never seeing such "superior meaning." I think the study of Chinese literature is almost reaching a point of feverishness. We should take off our hats, let the breeze cool us, open the high-quality paper windows that past poets and critics have pasted for us, take a breath of fresh air, and look at what color the clouds are in the sky and what kind of flowers and trees are on the ground, instead of being like dwarfs watching a play, simply echoing the lengths of others—but one thing: to do this great work, you must at least be a poet with ideals and analytical abilities, and you must put in a great deal of effort.</p>
<h3>Xie Die Shan's Fortune-Telling Booth</h3>
<p>— Lü Mengjiao</p>
<p>After the defeat at Anren, Mr. Xie Die Shan retreated to Jianyang, selling fortunes to support his mother, but he always placed a hemp banner and cried facing east, for he never for a moment forgot revenge. The city stele still exists, this poem is a record of this.</p>
<p>Deep the years of resentment in the southern sky,</p>
<p>His hair dishevelled as he faced east,</p>
<p>Each day torrents of tears fall,</p>
<p>The city hides one who does not know their grand ambitions.</p>
<h3>Magpie Bridge Fairy - Night at Xuanwu Lake</h3>
<p>— Huang Shaohong</p>
<p>Orchid oars like scissors, lotus leaves like covers, seagulls float in the green ripples in pairs. Riding the wind halfway to the sky, lightly, do not enter the cold Guanghan palace. Songs and flutes in the clouds, human tears, who awakens to the rise and fall? The courtyard is already unbearable to hear, let alone singing in the quiet back courtyard.</p>
<h3>The United Nations General Assembly in Paris</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>The Third United Nations General Assembly was officially opened on September 21st at the former site of the Chaillot Palace Museum in Paris. Based on the experience of the past three years, the world has been disappointed in the ideals initially embodied by the United Nations organization. Even this session, given the current international backdrop, will likely end with everyone leaving in disharmony after a battle of words. However, the realization of an ideal, especially an ideal of human harmony, naturally involves many difficulties and obstacles. As long as humanity does not lose its belief in lasting world peace, then, despite the many shortcomings of the United Nations organization today, it is still an ideal worth pursuing for humanity.</p>
<p>The Chaillot Palace Museum is the largest and most modern building in Paris, covering ten acres and directly facing the famous Eiffel Tower. Although France was impoverished after the war, it mobilized 3,000 workers in mid-May to work day and night on renovations and remodeling to prepare the venue. The entire venue can accommodate 1,500 delegates from various countries, 1,300 secretaries and other staff, as well as an even larger number of journalists and photographers from various countries.</p>
<p>The French people are naturally excited and proud that this great international conference is being held in their country. Based on the acronym of the United Nations conference in French, they call it "Onusia," and in fact, they regard the United Nations as an independent country within the city of Paris.</p>
<p>The order within the "territory" of "Onusia" is maintained by 50 United Nations police officers from Lake Success. French police only maintain traffic and general order outside the "territory." Apart from the participating French delegates and French guests, the only French public officials allowed to reside within the "territory" of "Onusia" are 20 firefighters. French police can only enter the "territory" when urgently summoned by the United Nations Security Council. These police officers are specially selected in advance, and each must know at least one or two foreign languages.</p>
<p>During the conference, "Onusia" has its own bank, post office, travel agency, press office, and even a small temporary hospital. On both sides of the conference hall are interpreter rooms, where they can translate each person's speech into various languages and broadcast it. On the other side are broadcast, telephone, and electric typing rooms.</p>
<p>The telephone room has 23 operators managing 2,400 telephones and can connect with delegates' home countries. In the basement of the venue is a printing house that can print two tons of paper per day, equivalent to 10,000 books. The venue also sets aside 800 seats each day for visitors.</p>
<p>For such a large-scale conference, the issue of food is naturally very important. The Paris authorities have specially built a restaurant on the Trocadéro Square that can accommodate 1,000 guests, with four bars attached, offering all kinds of famous cigarettes and wines, and of course, the famous French champagne is indispensable.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from East Java</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>The US government, due to the high cost of building materials, built two paper houses in Wisconsin, using paper substitutes for all materials, which were carefully researched by many scientists. These two houses have now been built for four years, and have been through frost, rain, and various weathers without any damage.</p>
<p>US science is trying to use milk as fertilizer and has achieved great success. It is said that the soil after using milk has improved greatly, and the produced yams and onions are far more numerous than the soil that has not been fertilized with milk. Some areas in the US countryside produce too much milk, and because the freight is too expensive to export, it may be used as fertilizer in the future.</p>
<p>Police dogs have a keen sense of smell, but they often make mistakes. Therefore, when investigating evidence in US courts now, the instructions of police dogs must be supplemented by other evidence, otherwise they will not be adopted.</p>
<p>In 1930, a new device was installed in two widely separated buildings in New York City. When making telephone calls in these two buildings, the caller could see the face of the other party by wireless electricity. The cost of this equipment is very high, so it has not been popularized to this day.</p>
<h3>The Historical Records Possesses No Extraordinary Spirit</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Previous people seemed to have said that Sima Qian, because he had traveled over famous mountains and great rivers and was inspired by them, thus his writing possessed an extraordinary spirit. This saying seems plausible, but it does not conform to reason. Famous mountains and great rivers are related to geography, Sima Qian wrote history, the two seem to have no involvement. Even if famous mountains and great rivers are spectacular, how can they make historical books possess extraordinary spirit?</p>
<p>The extraordinary nature of the Historical Records does not lie in the scenery, nor does it lie in the person who wrote it, but rather in the extraordinary events of the people recorded. History is essentially recording people and events; if the people and events recorded are not extraordinary, how can the writing recording people and events be extraordinary? — unless it is said that the events recorded in the Historical Records are all lies, entirely from the author's imagination. Saying that Sima Qian's writing possesses extraordinary spirit places emphasis on the person who records people and events, while neglecting the people and events recorded; it is to think that the Grand Historian was an extraordinary person, and not to marvel at the brilliance and strangeness of human affairs. This view is very unfavorable to the Grand Historian.</p>
<p>Or someone might say, if the Grand Historian was not an extraordinary person, how could there have been so many extraordinary people and events in the Han Dynasty? This is still another way of doubting that what the Grand Historian recorded was not true. What dynasty did not have extraordinary people and events, it is just that historians of other dynasties were mostly unwilling or dared not honestly and directly record them. Therefore, the difference between the Grand Historian and other historians is only this: he had a richer sense of justice than ordinary people, and when he felt something, he had to speak his mind, even if it meant inviting disaster, he would not care. The reason why the Historical Records is considered to have an extraordinary spirit is this; this also answers why, among books of this kind of nature in our country, there is only this one. Looking at the number of "extraordinary articles" and "extraordinary books" published in the American publishing industry today, which is far beyond what our country can reach, we can understand everything. Does America have so many extraordinary people who can write extraordinary articles?</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the Historical Records possesses an extraordinary spirit, it is derived from the scrutiny of human affairs, it is bestowed by the grace of extraordinary people and events in the world, it does not come mysteriously from appreciating famous mountains and great rivers. We can say this directly: Sima Qian's being subjected to castration was a first-class extraordinary event in the world, and the people who subjected him to castration were first-class extraordinary people in the world!</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>During my illness, I casually flipped through the newspaper and saw the news of Feng Yuxiang being burned to death, and I couldn't help but recall this man's decades of turning clouds and overturning rain and the influence on past situations. Because of stomach illness and fatigue, I only have a bowl of thin porridge every day, and my mind and body are both exhausted. I cannot hold a pen. Recently, I changed to Western medicine and felt a little refreshed, so I force myself to write.</p>
<p>Feng's most amazing performance in his life was the scene of defecting and capturing Cao in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, leaving an impression of "dread" on the human world. And what was even more unexpected was that after performing "Trapping Cao's Mansion" (stationing troops in the Nine Gates and imprisoning Cao Kun in Xinhua Palace), he immediately put on a show of "Forcing the Qing Palace," sending a large group of soldiers to break into the Forbidden City and drive away the deposed Emperor Puyi and all the palace members. The reason why it is called unexpected is that Puyi's long residence in the old Forbidden City, towering high in the center of the capital of the Republic of China, and still issuing orders of reward and pension to his old officials and those who served the Republic but still remembered the Qing Dynasty's glory, was inappropriate. Therefore, clearing this "cancer" was not a bad thing. However, there were two most appropriate timing to relocate Puyi, both of which were not carried out. One was after the Xinhai Revolution, at the beginning of the Republic of China, when the abdication agreement originally contained a clause immediately ordering the relocation to the Summer Palace; the other was the Ding Si Restoration, when Zhang Xun used force to support him to restore the throne. Although it can be explained as being passive, since he ascended the "throne" and issued an "edict," he could be accused of usurpation and driven out, which would also be righteous. As for the Feng-Zhi Second War in the Jiazi year, which was the second act of the Feng-Huan First War in the eleventh year, Feng first punished the direct faction and then reconciled with Cao and the rate, which was nothing more than a circle of warlord disturbances, and had nothing to do with the Qing Dynasty. Suddenly being expelled, hastily and embarrassed, the Qing Emperor truly had a "calamity comes from the sky while sitting at home."</p>
<p>As for the clear signs of the impact of this move on the later general situation, it was the "Manchukuo" after the September 18th Incident. Originally, old Yuan's keeping Puyi in the palace in the early Republic had deep meaning. At that time, there were not a few Qing Dynasty old people and clan association thugs who were stupidly plotting a coup. If they were released out of the city, it would be tantamount to letting a tiger out of its cage. It is better to circle them in the center of the inner and outer cities, with layers of city walls, unable to cross the thunder pool for one step. The "Forbidden City" of the former Qing Dynasty forbade subjects from entering without permission, in order to express the emperor's dignity, so it was called "forbidden." The "Forbidden City" of the early Republic was to prohibit Puyi from going out privately, in order to prevent manipulation and utilization, so it was the same as "imprisonment." This both settled dissent and prevented future troubles. The political effect cannot be compared with emotional use.</p>
<p>Feng's expulsion of Puyi from the palace did not consider the aftermath and where he would go. The Japanese, with their keen eyes and quick hands, saw him as a rare commodity and welcomed him from the old Zui Mansion to the Legation Quarter in the first place. Then, they escorted him from Beijing to the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, and arranged a "palace" style residence for him, so that the old ministers could still visit him as before, and the Japanese consuls and bureaucrats also paid their respects on New Year's Day according to the Qing Dynasty's two-nation etiquette. Puyi's emperor's style in the palace in the past could only reach the old ministers, while in the Japanese Concession, he was also respected by the Japanese. With such means and such a conspiracy, outsiders can see clearly, how can the authorities not be confused. The Japanese movement to establish "Manchukuo" has not been a day or two. Later, Mr. Xinping's book "Zhengjiatun" has fraudulently narrated the failure of the Su Prince to manufacture a pseudo-country with assistance. Puyi's qualifications are far above Shanqi's, so after the September 18th Incident, Doihara immediately kidnapped him to the east from the Japanese Concession. It was simply taking advantage of the situation without any effort.</p>
<p>The establishment of "Manchukuo" and its impact on the overall situation in China and international fluctuations are well known in the world, so I will not elaborate.</p>
