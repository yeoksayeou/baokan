<h3>管制經濟物價　具體實施辦法</h3>
<p>財政工商兩部草擬中</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法執行時之若十具體實施補充辦法，財部及工商部正積極趕擬中，財部廿日起已恢復全日辦公制，晨間王雲五會召集有關各單位首長集會，報吿改革幣制之要點，並說明對若干補充辦法應速擬具，傳加强教行。工商部長陳啓天亦於廿日上午召集童季齡·張子柱兩次長及管制司長費劍揚，商業司長鄧翰良舉行會議，商討根據財政經濟緊急處分令擬具具體之實施辦法問題。陳氏除報吿幣制改革方案之內容外，並飭有關各司速於一二日內即擬具方案中有關之具體實施辦法，同時作如下之指示：（一）緊急處分令中規定物價凍結以八月十九日之物價折合金元，關於物價之調査及限價，議價之具體實施辦法，由管制司擬具。（二）禁止進口物品銷售辦法，（三）取締囤積居奇辦法，過去工商部曾擬訂有辦法，呈政院核示，應由管制司重加修正，予以加强。至天津·上海兩證券交易所奉令暫停營業，將來復業之辦法，以及公司變更登記辦法，其資本額應如何折算，由商業司與財部錢幣司會同擬訂。</p>
<h3>全國行荘資本　最高金劵百萬</h3>

<h3>王外長談話</h3>
<p>改革辦法嚴格執行　可使美援計劃收效</p>
<p>〔本報甫京廿日電〕外交部長王世杰廿日發表書面談話稱：「政府於數月前曾宣布自助方案，此次新法令則係實施該自助方案之主要部份，七月三日本人代表政府與美國簽訂經濟援助雙邊協定後，曾聲明本人將盡全力使中國政府以最大誠意，實行我方本身之責任。八月十九日總統令所頒布之改革，在此美援計劃實施期內，應更易成功，因爲國際收支不平衡，乃我國改革幣制的重大困難之一，美援計劃之執行，可以保證若干重要進口物資供給，於是此一重大困難在現時已大部份解除，在另「方面，此次新改革辦法之採取與嚴格執行，應可使美援計劃收得較爲充分之效果」。</p>
<h3>王雲五談金圓劵基金　以自力更生為主　國營事業準調整價格係避免膨脹</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕財長王雲五二十日下午六時招待中外記者，首宣布在此次改革幣制之前曾電吿國際貨幣基金會議執行委員會，說明中國已決定改革幣制及改革簡略要點，現已收到回電，對我國之改革幣制表示敬佩，並認爲措施甚爲適當，預祝改革之成功。繼即由王氏答復各報記者之詢問，茲擇誌其要點如下：（一）國營事業仍准按戰前之標準調整票價，係爲避免新幣之膨脹。同時對國營事業不再貼補，亦爲立法院之決議，幣制改革後，人民之收入雖未如戰前，甚至較戰前减一半，但國營事業之加價亦僅係參酌戰前之標準，並非完全按戰前之標準。（二）增加稅收，亦並非依戰前標準，將較戰前之標準略低，惟奢侈品稅則應多加。（三）公務員待遇不及戰前之標準，係因目前財政困難，故打一折扣，但至國家財政好轉時，再改善，月此次改過後，事實上已較過去法幣時代爲高。　輔幣決無于限制流通，有外記者曾詢其幣制改革後政府是不是要向美國借款，王氏笑稱：此爲我們之希望，在最初時，我們當然希望自力更生，但必要時自然也希望友邦之援助。王氏並以堅定之語氣稱：此次改革幣制，一定貫澈到底，無論任何人對此方案加以破壞，決予嚴懲。</p>

<h3>行政院內設置　經濟管制委會　派大員常駐滬津穗</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕行政院爲加强管制物價，取締投機囤積，調節物資供應，節約消費，以切實執行財政經濟緊急處分命令，已於行政院內設置經濟管制委會，負責策劃督導管制有關安定經濟之事項，並於上海一天津·廣州三區派定經濟管制督導大員，常駐督導，以期貫澈，而收成效。</p>
<h3>新幣制下物價必可穩定　平衡預算有把握　惟盼舉國一致遵守規定</h3>
<p>俞總裁招待記者</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行兪總裁鴻鈞昨晨自京返滬後，十一時於央行招待記者，強調幣制改革為平衡財政收支之必要措施。其報吿全文如下：</p>
<p>「我們都知道物價上漲，與預算不能平衡是互爲因果的；若想等到預算平衡再改幣制，必將受到這種循環作用的影響而不知拖延到什麽時候。一切財政經濟措施都有賴於幣値的穩定，所以政肘毅然下了最大的決心，改革幣制，利用新幣制下物價的穩定，來幫助預算的平衡，預算接近平衡，即可得到長期的穩定，因此這次的緊急處分令，以改革幣制與整理財政爲中心措施，而輔以當制經濟等的穩定物價方案。金銀外幣處理辦法與外匯資產登記管理辦法，一方面可以除去擾亂國內金融物價的一個重要因素，一方面也可以將這些資產予以充分利用，使其可以幫助國內的生產與建設。這次的緊急處分令，與以前改革方案不同的地方，就是從最基本方面着手這點可以看見政府已經下了最大的決心，期在必成。由王部長的談話中，我們可以看見政府不獨有平衡預算的決心，而且有平衡預算的辦法。在改革幣制之後，國家財政定可以大爲改善，但是各條款中的措施是互相關連，全盤配合的，其中有許多方面需要社會人士與工商金融界的合作，希望舉國一致遵守各項規定，以達到穩定經濟，增加生產與發展貿易的目的」。</p>
<p>新幣自週一起　全國普遍發行</p>
<p>兪氏繼答覆記者詢問稱：金圓劵於即日起正式發行，惟以廿。廿一兩日銀錢業臨時休息，廿二日爲星期日，故事實上新幣將於週一（廿三日）開始流通。國行於本月十五日起，已將各種金圓劵秘密運達全國各地分行，兪氏並出示各種金圓券之樣張，一元，五元，十元，五十元，一百元等五種，均係一九四五年（卅四年）美國鈔票公司所承印，元以下角分等劵則係一九四六年（卅五年）德納羅印刷公司所承印，視新幣之印製年份，可知政府於抗戰勝利後，即已着手幣制之改革工作。（金圓券樣張銅圖刋六版）</p>
<p>關於如何澈底執行財政經濟緊急處分令中各項辦法，兪氏透露蔣經國氏於廿日晨曾訪渠有所商談，渠已定廿一日邀集吳市長·宣司令·潘議長·方主委·徐副議長·及林局長崇墉等，舉行會議，就此作具體之研討。</p>
<p>希望銀行利率　恢復戰前標準</p>
<p>兪氏又答覆如下詢問稱：（一）金圓劵是管理金本位之一種，（二）銀樓飾金買賣，已有明文規定，但不得以金塊熔化飾金。（三）銀行利率，政府當使逐漸低减，希望恢復至戰前標準。（四）新幣發行後，其折合率決不變更。（五）外匯平衡基金委員會將予撤銷，但金管局及輸管會則仍有存在必要。</p>
<p>派員分赴各地　指示發行技術</p>
<p>〔又訊〕兪總裁廿日午十二時召集該行各局處負責人舉行會議，討論執行幣制改革之技術上各項問題。俞氏曾有詳收指示，幷聽取報吿。例如如何轉賬及估計市塲頭寸之需要，均當塲予以決定。此外，為使外埠各重要分行明瞭執行技術起見，幷經決定派冀朝鼎（西安）高方（平津）王錘（東北）林維英（穗）方善桂（漢口）即日分赴各分行，加以指導。幷悉；因公留氾之重慶分行經理楊曉波·厦門分行經理吳本景。亦於即日啓程就道。會議至下午二時始畢。</p>
<h3>鑄造輔幣　滬造幣廠將恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕輔幣之鑄造，財部將恢復上海造幣廠主特其事，將分爲三種，（一）銀幣，分一元與五角者兩種，（二）鎳幣，分二角一角，五分者三種。（三）銅幣，僅一分者一種，上述三種輔幣，銀幣及鎳幣，多係原存於重慶·貴陽及成都等地者，已運至京·氾，銅幣則必須新鑄。</p>
<h3>樓桐孫談改革幣制　今後赤字應公開　希望國民依期兌換金鈔</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕經濟學專家樓桐孫談：此次改革幣制所採之辦法，足證當局具有面對現實，企求澄淸目前通貨紛亂現象之勇氣。方案中規定之金元券對於法幣·金·銀·美鈔之比率，採取接近事實之比例，而此一比例與戰前法幣實行時之比率，已至相當接近之程度，如此之改革，國內外所可因改革幣制而發生之市塲變動將减至最低限度，尤其公開發行，設立監理機構，並規定發行之最高額，此爲一大進步並爲本人多年所主張者，此番能實行，本人深引爲慰，惟亦不無遺憾者，法幣及金·銀·外幣兌換金元劵時，並眾相當採用去年八月羅馬尼亞及去年十二月蘇聯改革幣制時之精神，於改革幣制時，萬有調節各階層購買力之美意。至此次辦法中提及國家預算之平衡，依先進國家之先例欲求國家預算之眞正平衡，應該確定國庫與發行機構之法定關係，今後赤字應完全公開，一面可以收發行監督之實效，一方面可以喚起國民對於國家財政之注意。關於人民所存之金，銀及外幣，應於九月三十日以前向央行兌換一點，樓氏希望國民發揮高度之愛國心，遵照政府頒布之辦法，依期兌換，而政府對於銀樓業之管理，亦希望研究更強之辦法。關於國人在國外資產之申報登記，樓氏亦望能認真執行。最後，樓氏並對於方案中加强管制金融機構一點，認爲特別重要，表示特別擁護，主張政府應具更大決心，逐步推行。</p>
<h3>物價改算金圓劵　一律照八月十九日為準　凡奸商私抬價格者嚴懲</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕政府對於此次財政經濟繫急處理辦法，視爲安定國民經濟，貫澈戡亂國策之關鍵，當此實旋伊始，難保無少數人民不明改革幣制之意義及效用，或有奸商不顧大局，私抬價格，擾亂市塲，行政院於昨夜院會決定各案呈准總統公布之後，立即通令全國各省市政府，依據加强經濟管制辦法之規定，對於各地物品及勞務之金圓劵價格，應一律照本年八月十九日當地價格爲最高改算標準，不得再行抬高，此後物價，並應照取締違反限價議價條例辦理，違者即依法嚴懲。</p>
<h3>張羣今飛往東京　逗留二週後赴南韓　麥帥明午為張氏洗塵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕張羣夫婦與外交部顧問邵毓麟氏定廿一日晨八時廿分搭西北航空公司班機逕飛東京，預定以兩週以上之時間，在日本各部份作廣泛之考察。如時間許可，並擬赴南韓一行。麥帥對張氏之赴日，甚表歡迎，已通知駐日代表團商團長，於本星期日設宴爲張氏夫婦洗塵。而各盟國留駐東京之代表，亦亟盼與張氏晤談。又張氏自抵滬後，此間亞東協會曾於昨日上午十時，由該會理事長賀耀組邀集日本問題專家多人，舉行座談茶會。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕記者以幣制改革徵詢立委簡貫三氏意見，承答：幣制改革及經濟措施之重大目的，在打擊少數人藉通貨膨脹及巧取豪奪，以維護大多數人之生活安定。此次公佈之方案，大體上尙稱滿意，惟亦有不無遺憾者，約言之，可如下列數點：（一）未按平民與富戶經濟大之懸殊，規定新舊幣兌換率之差異；（二）未凍結大量游資，而容許無限制以新幣兌換舊幣；（三）黄金美元之比價均顯較高，銀元之比價則規定略低；（四）對於富人在國外之外匯資產，未予凍結；（五）對於士兵及公敎人員薪餉之基數規定太低。以上各項，希當局能加以補救，以慰輿望。至黄金國有，爲本人多年之主張，今竟實現，頗爲欣慰。</p>

<h3>我穩定通貨措施　華爾街表示歡迎　國際貨幣基金會已接獲我通知</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日電〕中國政府發行新通貨一舉，使此間消息經常極爲靈通之華爾街銀行及貿易界人士至爲驚詫，彼等對此態度極爲謹愼。記者所訪問之多人，均稱：中國政府關於穩定通貨之任何措施，均將令人歡迎。但彼等就幣制改革，提出多端問題，並指出彼等未獲閱幣制改革方案全文以前，不能加以評論。貿易界人士均認爲價値穩定之中國新幣，將有補中美貿易，但彼等並未獲悉中國政府除改革幣制外，是否將取消貿易限制，使中美貿易更爲流暢。記者曾詢問華爾街人士，中國將金元與美元之兌率定爲四比一，此是否須經國際貨幣基金會批准？某銀行家答調：中國目前並非該基金會之指定會員國，故可自由規定新通貨與美元之兌率，但中國一且成爲指定會員國，則非待基金會許可，不得輕易將其通貨貶値或復値。中國幣制改革消息，係於本晨傳抵此間，頓成爲關切中國人士之談話主題，具有大批中國人士存款之美國各銀行，渴欲獲悉中國政府收兌人民所有美鈔之條例是否亦適用於此間中國人民存款，如確係如此，則又將如何實行，此間一般印象，俱認爲關於中國發行新幣情形，至少須在一週後方能明朗化。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日電〕中央社記者今探悉：國際貨幣基金會已接獲中國政府之正式通知，吿以中國之幣制改革，與建立中國「金元」諸事。聞國際貨幣基金之理事會今日下午曾集會討論中國改革幣制之報吿，對於中國新幣制，基金會方面，並無承認或採取任何行動之問題，故會後並未發表芷式聲明，說明基金會之立塲。該會某官員强調稱：中國之行動，固不必獲得國際貨幣基金會認可或否決。中國雖未被要求須以其所欲採取之步驟，事先通知基金會，但今竟有此表示，是足以證明中國與國際貨幣基金會間之密切合作。</p>

<h3>安定秩序首應消除亂源</h3>
<p>最近各地的工潮學潮迭起，大有「一波未平，一波又起」之勢，致使社會秩序混亂，人心動盪不安；在人民言，根本談不到「安居樂業」，無不渴望國家能變混亂爲安定；在國家言，社會秩序的安定與否，是國家治亂的象徵，决不能聽其自然演變下去。</p>
<p>但據各方面的報道，共匪作亂變本加厲，不顧人民的死活，竟在我後方各地潛佈間諜，從事「地下工作」，企圖開闢其所謂「第二戰綫」，俾與前綫匪軍相呼應。其所採取的手段，除了鼓動工潮及其他足以妨害生產的行爲而外，並利用各校的職業學生，在口頭上文字上爲匪宣傳，散發謠言，搖動人心，並凖備將來罷課，遊行，請願等大規模的運動。目前各校，雖然還在暑假之中，但仍爲職業學生所槃踞，視學校爲「租界」，公然作各種反政府的行動。凡是熟悉敎育界內情的人，莫不認爲一俟秋季開學，大規模的學潮卽將爆發，對於社會秩序必有嚴重影響。這種預測，决非危言聳聽之詞，實有其可靠的根據；政府當局爲防患於未然計，乃由行政院通令各地行政治安機關，妥爲預防；並頒佈戡亂時期後方應行注意之四大事項。不論爲安定民生社會秩序計，或爲維護國家命脈計，行政院採取此項措置，是値得全國人民一致擁護的。</p>
<p>我國目前的情勢，一方面是共匪的稱兵作亂，企圖以武力奪取政權；而在另一方面，則政府早已動員戡亂，期於最短期內剿淸匪徒，前綫戰爭雙方正打得火熱，政府豈能聽任共匪間諜在後方從事「地下工作」？但是要政府淸除匪諜安定後方秩序，則勢必要採取有損人民基本權利的措置，似乎不是行憲政府所應爲的，所以戡亂建國雖已爲當前的國是，但政府總不免有「投鼠忌器』的顧慮，不願放手去幹，以致姑息養奸，造成今日匪諜横行後方的局面。社會上竟有若干人士滿以爲行憲與戡亂是不能並行不背的，過去政府當局也犯着這種錯誤的見解，始終沒有「壯士斷腕」的精神：但時至今日，共匪間諜在憲政的掩雜之下，更加横行無忌，政府實迫處此，對於淸除後方匪諜，才採取緊急措置，凡是善良愛國的人民，自必能忍痛於一時的。</p>
<p>政治的民主化，是中華民國唯一的出路，只有實行三民主義，實施民主憲政，才能使中國成爲强大，統一，和平，民主的新中國，所以我們對於勝利後政治協商會議力求政治民主化軍隊國家化，以及後來政府召開國民大會制定民主　法，再依照憲法之規定，組織民主新政府，無不竭誠表示擁護。但是回過頭來看看共產黨，它稱兵作亂，旣不顧國家民族的命脈，也不顧念人民的死活，它爲了要奪取政權，竟不擇任何手段，爲了達到其目的，就是亡國滅種，它也毫無所惜。除了喪心病狂的人，願爲共匪間諜而外，大多數善良的老百姓，英不把共匪視爲人民的公敵；尤其是一般頭腦淸楚思想正礦的學生，深知匪亂一天不敉平，人民的生活一天不能安定。回想勝利以還人民的生活，有如「水益深，火益熱」，人民若不願償付重大的代價，暫時犧牲個人的基本權利，則就不能脫雖水火而登袵席的。政府的措置從表面看，似乎要損及人民的某本權利的，但是按之實際，政府的措置乃在安定社會秩序。好敎後方的人民能够安居樂業，好比是醫生替病人施用手術，忍痛於一時，就可以化險爲夷了。</p>
<p>不過，我們還要向政府說幾句話，近年來各地學潮工潮的迭起，除了匪諜的操縱和煽動而外，還有其他客觀的因紫，决非偶然的，所謂「物必自腐而後蟲生」，如果社會本身絕無問題，縱使匪諜有高人一等的手法，也不能無風生浪，更不能推波助瀾。所以我們希望各地的行政治安機關，除了切實執行行政院頒佈的辦法而外，並應正本淸源，預防一切亂源，務使匪諜無隙可乘。</p>

<h3>藏內部磨擦日甚　榮增將色拉寺荘田查封</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶慶二十日電〕記者頃獲自西藏十九日電訊：藏內部磨擦日甚，若干世家以後藏色拉寺之莊田爲戰利品，相互爭奪。攝政榮增打札，爲和緩色拉寺流亡僧徒與哲蚌寺僧徒之聯合陣綫，已將前奪色拉寺莊田之各世家產業全部査封。按：色拉寺爲前任攝政熱振學經寺院，已爲現任攝政榮增打札砲燬。又，去年哲蚌寺晴派僧徒往西寗貿易，當返至黑河時，遭藏方防軍誣認爲色拉商人，加以毒害，致引起哲蚌寺七千餘僧徒不滿，復經色拉寺流亡僧徒鼓吹，乃有共同反對榮增行爲。聞此次反榮增運動，曾得西寗塔爾寺班禪喇嘛在靑人員之支持。</p>

<h3>三國使節接獲新訓令　再與蘇外長晤談　索柯洛夫斯基重返柏林</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿日廣播莫斯科訊：英美法三國使節已自各該國政府接獲新訓令，希望於二十日與蘇外長莫洛托夫作第六次會晤</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科二十日電〕美英法三國駐蘇專使二十日曾舉行一連串會議，職是之故，似有若干基礎可相信，三國專使可能於今晚前會晤莫洛托夫。美駐蘇大使史密斯今日上午十時四十五分在美使館中與英國專使羅伯茲會議，列席者尙有美國公使科蘭及英外交參贊哈里遜。彼等商議九十分鐘後，史羅兩使即於十二時一刻驅車赴法大使館會晤法大使夏臺岳。三大使進行會議歷半小時後，史羅兩使又復返美大使館再度會議。美法英三國大使延期會晤莫洛托夫之原因，可能爲彼等獲取三國政府答覆困難所致。據可靠方面認爲此次會議，可能將公佈內容，除非三國專使認爲再須進行會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十九日電〕此間美方發言人今日表示保留性之把握稱，西方使節下次於莫溶　夫會議時，可望成立對德之東西協定。發言人稱，「我很樂觀。不過我們現在已經討論到牠的核心，故此次會議非到最後一分鐘，是很難說肯定話的。」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二十日電〕泰晤士報柏林訪員在該報撰文引證蘇方消息稱，蒙信駐德蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基業已返柏林，關於將西方列强排除於德國首都之外一事，携有蘇政府之正確訓令。該訪員繼稱，如莫斯科會商不能獲得最後協定，預料蘇聯將日漸使用壓力，使柏林封鎖達到百分之百之程度，此事目前已露端倪。該訪員結論稱，自莫斯科談判以及柏林所發生之一切事件觀之，皆顯示蘇聯在可能時，力岡獲得柏林之完全控判權。事實上在一週以內，蘇聯已兩度企圖越過其柏林區之界綫，控制西區之警權，不問其追捕黑市商之眞實用意爲何，然此事已暗示蘇聯此項目的，在算奪取西方列强權利之政策已日在增强中。</p>

<h3>聯合國決定在亞洲　設立防泛局</h3>
<p>經社理事會通過我提案</p>
<p>〔合衆社日內瓦十九日電〕聯合國經社理事會十九日通過中國提案，決定在亞洲及遠東設立聯合國防泛局。美國反對稱，該局侵及聯合國秘書長之職權，中國代表張彭春據理力爭，卒吿勝利。美代表索普主張設立「直屬秘譽處之技術組，由防泛專家充任之。」至於防泛局事則應由遠東經委會硏究之，而向經社會下次會議提報吿。蘇戰及其他十一國一致贊成中國提案，英美紐西蘭加拿大投反對票。張彭春氏否認防泛局有干涉秘書處職權之處，又稱，美國懼該局之成爲「半目主」，實係無稽之談。「我們不能再躭擱了幾百萬人在等着我們的決定。」</p>

<h3>蘇譴責美刧持蘇教師案　美拒絕蘇聯抗議　正式提出照會要求召回蘇領事</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十日電〕美國二十日要求蘇聯召回總領事洛茂金，因渠在三蘇籍敎師案中，採取「非常不礦當」之行動。照會內譴責洛茂金曾拒絕紐約警局官員與高遜基娜夫人會晤，以阻撓警局之調査工作，並强逼高夫人作願意返國之虛僞聲明，照會內稱：「美國政府認爲洛茂金總領事之行動，賞濫用其職位之特權，及破壞關於外交官員行動之一般所承認之標準」。</p>
<p>關於高遜基娜夫人及桑馬林夫婦案，美國照會內稱：據適當之美國當局調査報吿：不但表示蘇聯「劫持」之譴責毫無根據，而且顯出蘇聯政府官員曾參加非常不確當之行動。」照會內繼稱：美國「必須無條件拒絕蘇聯照會內之一切譴責及暗示，因其完全與事實不符。」照會係由副國務卿羅維特簽字，於十九日晚送達蘇聯大使館，此係美國政府在該案中第一次採取之外交攻勢。</p>

<h3>霍浦金回憶錄發表　故羅斯福曾在德黑蘭會議中　違反我意旨允蘇使用大連港</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕霍浦金回憶錄今日發表，故羅斯福總統於德黑蘭會議中，首先向史達林表示，蘇聯於戰後可能取得大連，以應蘇聯對不凍港一需。</p>
<p>名劇作家薛伍德加强說明，羅斯福此事，第」次發表是在德黑蘭而非雅爾達。（據一般傳說，當時羅斯福甚爲虛弱乃致不察其所爲有何重要性。）史達林即表示意見，認爲此建議必爲中國所反對，但羅斯福稱，渠認爲渠等可同意使大連成爲一自由港。薛伍德稱，「依我個人所了解，羅斯福並非僅僅揣測而已—事實上數天前羅氏已在開羅與蔣總統討論此一問題。」</p>
<p>此後，霍浦金吿史達林·邱吉爾·艾登。及莫洛托夫稱，盟軍戰後太平洋基地並不難於安排。霍浦金稱，「我美國人民不欲在脫離日本而獲得自由之任何島上取得主權。聯合國對它們或將採取保護手段。至於獲得獨立後之菲律賓我們仍認爲應有美國之海軍及空軍基地，而不受聯合國之控制。</p>
<p>薛伍德稱，數天後，羅斯福邱吉爾及兩國參謀總長於開羅會議時，「羅斯福覺得應對蔣總統實行諾言。按十天前羅氏曾允在東南亞戰國發動兩次激讓，蓋史達林之突然在德黑國自動發表蘇聯願意加入對日作戰，已使整個戰爭局勢改變。</p>
<p>薛氏稱：德黑蘭會戰中，羅斯福告史達林謂。渠所計劃之戰後聯合國，包括：第一，一世界性的大會討論世界問題。第二，一執委會，包括中英美蘇及數小國，執行非軍事的問題。第三，「國際警察」之組織，包括中英美蘇四國，此機構有權立即處理任何威脅和平之事件。史達林以爲此四國警察機構之建議，不會爲歐洲各小國甘心接受，理由就是，他不相信中國於戰爭結束後，會十分強盛，而且即使中國埂分強盛，歐洲國家亦不願中國作為強制他們的權力機關。渠乃提出一折衷辦法，建議在歐洲與遠東各設一委員會。羅斯福稱，渠雖然十分淸楚中國目前之衰弱情形，但渠堅持中國必須參加莫期科之四强宣言，因爲他是在爲將來打算，認爲中國四萬萬人民都是朋友而不是可能的仇敵。」</p>
<h3>史達林與狄托的鬥爭（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（原文載七月九日「美國新聞與世界報吿」雜誌）</p>
<p>接着狄托來了一個反擊，於四月間以措詞强硬的覆函拒絕蘇聯的指責。他竭力辭護他的政策最適合南國國情，並不和馬克斯·列密主義相牴觸。同時爲了避免反對者的口實起見，狄托下令小工業和零售業立即實行國營，同時對自耕農徵收一項新的穀物稅，迫使邊際農民加入南國集體農塲的代替物合作社。</p>
<p>南領袖不願屈膝</p>
<p>可是反對派却轉移陣地，違抗這些命令，聲言南國尙無充分準備，如果强制實行，國內的分配制度將遭破壞。這回莫斯科方面又支持反對派。</p>
<p>接着是反對派領袖的被肅淸，五月六日佐傑維契和海勃朗同時被開去內閣職務，並被拘押起來。六月初佐氏復被剝除中將官銜。據未證實的報吿，海勃朗被秘密審訊，並於六月底被處死刑。</p>
<p>同時，貝爾格勒於五月四日及廿二日先後接到莫斯科方面措詞更加强硬的函牘。這兩封信被狄托拒絕以後，共產國際情報局即於六月下旬在布加勒斯特召集會議，討論蘇聯對狄托的指控。</p>
<p>於是南期拉夫就和共產國際情報局斷絕關係了。狄托拒絕派遣代表出席布加勒斯特會議。共產國際情報局通過一條決議，確定了莫斯科的控吿，責備他不接受蘇聯的意見。一面慫恿南國「思想健全」的共產黨員把他的政策改革一下，否則就索性把他和他的領袖黨徒一齊推翻而另選他人代之。</p>
<p>結果來了一個反擊。狄托元帥不願屈膝，否認共產國際情報局有對他頒發命令之權。他維護他的共產黨員的立塲，堅持要和蘇聯發生更密切的關係，並擬直接向史達林呼籲，以推翻共情局的決議。但是他依舊拒絕蘇聯對於他的政府的一切指責，南國的政府領袖們，包括副總理卡臺爾奇在內，和總理聯合一起，反抗莫斯科。</p>
<p>蘇南衝突的後果</p>
<p>這件事情的結果是；西方國家知道蘇聯集團裏面已經發生了裂痕；衛星國知道反抗莫斯科而離開它是可能的事；克林姆宮知道它已經對大局處置失當，將危及其第二次世界大戰的最大收穫，即合併東歐以形成蘇聯的安全地帶。</p>
<p>現在莫斯科和貝爾格勒雙方均感進退維谷，但雙方談判之門尙未關閉。他們堅持雙方的爭執是共黨間的爭執，不是蘇南政府間的爭執。兩國的外交關係仍舊不絕如縷，蘇南聯明依然有效。</p>
<p>美國目前有兩條路綫可擇一而行：它可以藉貸款與貿易鼓勵狄托繼續和莫斯科分道揚鑣，或者犧牲南斯拉夫的利益和蘇聯做一筆買賣，因爲在蘇聯支持下的南國要求，至今成爲對奧和約及解決特港問題的最大障礙。</p>
<p>可是美國當局的行動異常審慎，並沒有遽下結論，斷定莫斯科和貝爾格勒間的分裂是永久的。但是在西方各地，不管蘇聯對柏林怎樣施用壓力，戰爭的恐懼是漸漸消散了。一般人覺得蘇聯在東歐方面已經大忙特忙，在令後若干時期內，決無餘暇對歐洲其他部分施用壓力了。</p>

<h3>公用事業價格　難照戰前標準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據公用局負責人表示：改革幣制後，公用事業價格恐仍難恢復至戰前原價，蓋公用事業所用燃料價格上漲過鉅，如煤油已較戰前漲六倍，而柴油亦漲五倍，其他五金指數等亦難平衡，故公用事業價格難與戰前相接近。</p>

<h3>幣制改革後　房租新標準　地政局下週會商　當不致高於戰前</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕幣制改革後，關於本市房租計算標準如何，記者昨訪晤地政局負責人，據談稱：幣制改革消息公佈後，地局對房租改訂辦法尙在考慮中，惟本市可能發生兩種情形即房東要求依戰前租金額以金圓券計算，房客則要求以現繳房租額折合金圓券計算，倘依前者，則一般市民無力負担，倘依後者，則房租可低至僅値金圓券幾角，故新房租標準之訂定，當視一般市民之收入情形，使房客力能負祖，同時亦須顧及房東之合理收入，使其有投資建築新屋之興趣，惟無論如何，新租金當較戰前租額爲低。</p>

<h3>對整理財政新措施　本市各界表示樂觀　希望切實執行博取民眾信用</h3>
<p>政府頒佈財政經濟緊急處分命令，實行幣制改革後，本市各方反應均極良好，中央社記者爲明瞭各界領袖人物對此項揹施之反響，特分訪徵詢意見，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>邱良榮</p>
<p>中國國際貿易協會總幹事邱良榮氏稱：任何經濟活動，祗有在貨幣穩定之下，才能健全，國際貿易當然不能例外，今後幣値穩定，物價穩定，市塲利息抑低，國內金融活潑，進出口均可望有合理利潤，不再如過去之成爲投機性交易，然後國際貿易自能健全，向上發展，吾人在欣奮之餘，深望政府對於輸出入貿易政策，予以改善，確定一切設施，應以協助外銷，獎勵生產爲目的，凡不合此種需要的機構和手續，應予淘汰。同時今後人民所有金銀外幣以及國外資產，依法均須移入政府掌握之下，政府所需外匯不虞無給，希望國家行局祗注意如何以金融力量扶助人民經營有利貿易，不再直接參加購銷業務，對於次要轍出物資，以及商人不易經營之物資，政府應以種種方法，協助商民經營，期能推廣貿易，增加外匯收入，裨益於幣制之穩定。</p>
<p>吳蘊初</p>
<p>全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初稱：八月十九日總統頒佈財政經濟緊急處分命令，制定各項辦法，在應付囤積投機及黄金美鈔之猖獗，此確爲一種對症之治標良藥，而折合法幣的數字亦尙適當，現經毅然施行，在我國經濟史上，誠値得大書特書的一件大事。就本人忽促之間所感到的簡略意見，以爲：（一）目前國家社會現狀，痼疾已深，病源太多，是否一貼猛烈藥石所能立起沉疴，似不可太存奢望。（二）政府方案旣經公布確定施行，必須切實百分之百來執行，以博取一般民衆的信用，如信用失去，便將重蹈法幣　覆轍。（三）尙有許多小節，如（甲）滬上工人指數已在三百萬以上，廢除指數，實行時恐不免發生糾紛；（乙）各地生活指數不同，亦即法幣的幣値不同，現一律以三百萬倍折合，其盈虛調劑方式似應多所顧及；（丙）貸款利息改低，則短期庫劵之利息是否可以改低；（丁）昨夜此項消息傳播後，今日零售日用品及菜塲食物價格無不飛漲，此或爲一時現象，然亦頗値注意，其他類似之事恐或尙多。</p>
<p>朱斯煌</p>
<p>銀行學會秘書處復旦銀行系主任敎授朱斯煌稱：這次所用的新幣，名稱為金圓，但如何長期維持此金圓券的幣價，關於整理財政加强管制經濟辦法所規定的各項辦法，如平衡財政收支，節約消費等，如何能使其完全辦到，均爲先決問題。這次改革與二十四年實行管理通貨時的改革，完全不同，該時之所以能穩定幣値者，因法幣可無限制買賣外匯，眞正虛金本位的本質也在於此，而根本的基礎尙在消耗的减少，生產的增加，和國信的樹立。</p>
<p>宋秉倫</p>
<p>上海市進出口商業同業公會常務理事宋秉倫稱：（一）按照人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法第四條第二項及外匯資產登記管理辦法第十條第二項之規定，金銀外幣依照兌換率折合美金，存儲於中央銀行之款，得憑輸入許可證支付輸入物品之貨價，如是則等於部份自備外匯之開放，如輸入許可證能配合發給，則今後工廠所需之重要生產器材及工業原料之恐慌，已得到補救。（二）出口貿易目前之困難，厥爲國外價格低落，現當局正謀對付之策，如有補救辦法，再配以幣制改革後新情勢，物價如能長期穩定則出口貿易自有其前途。</p>
<p>孫俶仁</p>
<p>上每市銀行商業同業公會秘書長孫俶仁稱：改革幣制最大的優點，爲一切符合實際的市塲情形，於人民毫無損失，譬如法幣三百萬元兌金圓劵一元，金圓券四元兌美鈔一元，而美鈔時價適爲法幣一千二百萬元，相互兌換，並無增損。又黄金每兩兌金圓券二百元，亦與市價法幣六億元相符。至於發行總額限定二十億元，而「金圓劵發行準備監理委員會」之職權，特別加大，如每月「檢査」，一報吿」，一公吿」等事，格外認眞辦理，其前途當可無慮。所希望者，「平衡國家預算」，「平衡國際收支」兩端，若能把握得定，則「管理經濟」，「穩定物價」諸事，亦可順利完成。</p>
<p>水祥雲</p>
<p>總工會理事長水祥雲稱：此次改革幣制，全國人民自應一致擁護，如今後物價確能臻於穩定，工人當感受無上福利，若物價仍有波動而工人指數已遭凍結，則將感不安。</p>
<h3>工業界一般意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工業界對改革幣制之意見，約可綜合爲下列谷點：（一）政府今後必須控制更多量之物資大量拋售，供應市塲，價格規定後，不宜隨時調整，如台糖公司之糖，紡建公司之紗，中植公司之油，戶口配給米，工業用煤斤等國營事業物資，應持久平價供應市塲，然後始能收抑平物價之效。（二）公用交通事業應維持現價。（三）銀行貸款利息亦應抑低至戰前一分，八厘，與六厘之標準。（四）工業界所感困難者，以資金折合金幣後，必須重行調整增資，如此則股息開支必大增。（五）生活指數取消後，若物價仍不能如理想之穩定，則後患無窮，希政府及早注意。</p>
<p>政府須大量拋售物資　銀行貸款利息應抑低</p>
<h3>嚴禁遊行請願　總工會奉令後　轉飭所屬知照</h3>
<p>市參議會第一屆六次大會時，曾爲小學敎師多次向該會及敎育局請願，而其代表旣不表示身份，復不肯依照規定簽名，其行動顯有妨害秩序之跡象，設任其一味放任，不僅有碍治安，足可影響戡亂，經大會決議，並決定辦法三項，函請市府嚴予禁止，以平亂源。昨市總工會已接奉上項訓令，並已轉飭各業工會一體知照，茲錄本集原辦法三項如下：（一）請願團體應切實遵照中央規定，其代表不得超過十人。（二）請願代表必須携帶國民身份證，職業證明文件，及所代表之團體證明文件。（三）如再聚衆請願，應由警局嚴加制止。</p>
<h3>輪業今日討論　調整運價問題</h3>
<p>政府公佈改革幣制及整理財政加强管制經濟辦法後，本市各交通事業機關，一致對前途表示樂觀。招商局所有各綫客貨輪，照常來往，唯銀行休業，各部門均感現鈔需用缺乏，幸有一部份客票售款收入，乘客購票亦均早於日前備妥，故客票並未因銀行休業而减少出售。另據該局初步估計：現在客貨運之價格，均較戰前運價爲低，是否需要調整及如何調整，刻正在詳細統計研究中。同時靜待交部指示。船聯會及上海輪船業公會定廿一日上午八時半，舉行理監事聯席會議，以商討一切。</p>

<h3>市場巡禮　菜場價格　略呈混亂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕改革幣制公布實施後本市小菜塲肉類蔬菜等，昨晨價格參差不一，蒼大部份菜販肉舖對改革幣制內容尙欠明瞭。淸晨各菜塲初設攤時，頗多不知適從，往往以一二攤販之意見而影響全菜塲之價格大致在熱鬧區之菜塲，價格較有標準，偏僻住宅區附之菜塲價格，較爲混亂。惟近二一月來小菜塲魚，肉，蔬菜價格，幾無日不漲，近數日上漲尤烈，故昨晨之波動，可視爲賡續前數日之趨勢而來者。鮮猪肉每斤最高有達三百萬元者，但亦有仍售二百廿萬元者，大多數小菜塲均在二百四十萬，二百六十萬與二百八十萬元之闐。牛肉每斤最高二百萬元，最低一百四十萬元，較前日平均普加一成至二成，鷄蛋每枚自十四萬元起至十八萬元，價格因大小而異，鴨蛋大者二十萬元，約較前日每枚漲二萬元，靑菜，豆芽菜，毛豆均廿萬元一斤，亦有廿五萬元一斤者，餘者均較前日行情略爲提高。</p>

<h3>對蚜蟲作戰</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　趙展</p>
<p>〔本報　陽十九日航訊〕七月底，記者訪問遼中農村時，農民就指出蜜虫（蚜虫）爲害，那時災情還輕，大家切盼老天賜雨，農民最可愛，受自然之害，又希望自然拯救他。</p>
<p>不到半月，嚴重的蚜虫災害釀成了，瀋陽外圍七縣均被波及，災情之重，實爲罕見。估計各縣被災農作面積，約五百萬畝，僅高粱受損害，平均可有百分之五十的收成。豆·穀幸無影響。但高燙是東北的主要農作物，蚜虫與人爭食的災象旣成，對於瀋陽的小康之局的確是一種打擊。本來，農民眼望一片靑青的高粱，做着美妙的夏夜夢，現在是眼望着被蚜虫侵蝕的高粱穗而澘然流淚了。</p>
<p>繁殖力特別强</p>
<p>據專家談：小形昆虫種類繁多，此種害虫名蚜虫，屬雙翅目，繁殖力極强，一年中可繁殖十代至廿代以上。各世代之形態及習性均不同，以形能及習性分別，可分有翅蚜虫及無翅蚜虫，有翅者常常移動，無翅者定居一處，依季節可分爲夏季生及冬寄生兩種，夏寄生於禾木科植物，冬寄生於薔薇科植物。因其性喜羣集，分泌黏質液體，使寄生植物之組織衰弱萎縮，發育不良，影響結實。</p>
<p>四種藥治蚜蟲</p>
<p>小小的蚜虫使此間的人們大爲煩惱，於是開始研究滅虫之術，由政委會農田水利處擬就「蚜虫治除簡法」，其中列舉：（一）地力粉皂液，（二）地力斯皂液，（三）烟草水，（四）肥皂液，四種有效藥品，說明其製法，此項化合肥皂水的預算為流通券廿億。市參議會也發揮民意，電請政院即立撥運大批蕎麥種子，空運來瀋，並提倡農民種菜補救。另外試驗用DDT殺虫，打算由靑島空運大量DDT粉來瀋，以飛機向附近各縣噴射。這一塲與昆虫的戰爭顯見是十分緊張。</p>
<p>高粱田災情重</p>
<p>殺滅蚜蟲工作已在市郊區展開，據市府統計；市郊高粱種植面積爲二萬六千八百六十三畝，受災最重，現均呈枯黄色，市府已購買噴射器四十台分赴各區發動農民噴射液體地力斯殺蟲。</p>
<p>抓時機補糧荒</p>
<p>遼寗建設廳長郭克悌，九日赴瀋陽四鄕調査蟲災，據談：初步調査高梁受蟲災之損失爲十分之三，仍有收穫希望，並不十分悲觀，當局正力謀補救。但據一位硏究農業的朋友吿訴我：噴殺蚜蟲時機已遲，收效甚微，補救之法，應下種蕎麥，可是　麥種子還沒有來，恐怕錯過時機，最好種白菜蘿葡，庶幾稍補糧荒。</p>

<h3>鄭州新鄕之間</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報新鄕十六日航訊〕隴海路被支解後，豫北變成了鄭汴孤島的後方，由於豫北的控制區域反較黄河以南要大，所以軍差供應，豫北替河南祖負了較大的責任。</p>
<p>當流綫型的冷氣列車昂揚於京滬路上的現在，可憐這一節不滿一百公里的平漢路中段，爲了要担任鄭汴與豫北間聯絡的任務，依然在抱殘守闕地牢守着幾個早已不能使用的機車和幾列破破爛爛的敞車，蹀蹊於大河南北。</p>
<p>可是，請別小覷了它，里程雖短，然而路方所化費於這一段鐵路上的精力，並不比平時處理整段平漢路的要少，拿鐵軌說吧：從八公斤，十六公斤的輕便軌到四十二公斤，四十三公斤的正軌，長度方面從六米突到十點九米突差不多四十多種的鐵軌，這段路全都具備，算得上一個鐵軌展覧會。拿枕木說吧，從黄河北岸到小冀站的這一段，枕木早已腐朽生菌，經過車輛不斷的輾壓，露出鐵軌兩旁的一端，都已翹了起來。要換，不但沒錢，並且無料。目前新焦段搶修所用的枕木，還是想的變通方法，即以最平常的石子而論，都有困難。新鄭段向北，原只通到新鄕，然而爲了石子，於是再向北延長了二十公里通到路王墳，這才先解除了石荒，否則，今年秋汎黄河水位增高時，黄河橋橋基沒有石子保護，通車決不可能。可是新鄕而北，治安不太好，列車時常遭受「八路」匪軍的冷槍。鄭安機務段的司機領班孟仁山君指點着機車上的縈纍彈痕給我看，這是半個月前的事，機車險些兒打垮。這一下鐵路工人傷亡了五個。</p>
<p>最大的問題還是煤。豫西諸鑛，大的丢了，小的無法供應，新焦路斷後，沁河決口，洪永遍溢於新鄕焦作間，煤塊出不來，隴海東段路還沒有修通，賈江煤也供應不上，所存的一些有限的賈江煤，限制了新鄭間每週只能對開三次列車。路方時時刻刻注意煤的存量，搯着指頭計算着還能維持多久？</p>
<p>我和平漢路鄭州辦事處李學詒處長的十分鐘談話，換來了這許多問題。第二天我乘車北上，苦難的車廂，裝滿了無數的苦難的乘客。</p>
<p>車子走到黄河南岸，駐軍要檢査旅客，一檢査就是一兩個鐘點。勝利以後，軍方爲了保護這一座過了保險期已有三十多年的大橋，確實費了不少心力。我希望能照一個相，經過車站站長轉向駐軍某團團長請示，結果是不准，我下了車，禿頭的邙山正對着我，山下的銅骨水泥碉堡，陪伴着住在窰洞裏，終年生活於泥土氣息中的居民，一兩家窰洞的門前，還貼着褪了色的春聯，上面寫着：「時和世泰，人壽年豐」。</p>
<p>我和楊鴻樞稽査，黄河北峯站長何紀斌及李國珍工程司等在南峯站長室內小息。他們一口同聲地在報吿他們的生活的淸苦，老婆孩子都搬下鄉，可以節省些開支，飲食方面，據說他們已三月不知肉味。</p>
<p>車子於誤點一小時三十五分後駛抵新鄕。</p>
<p>新鄕，自道淸路興修後，顯然已增加了它的重要性，敵人的野心更大，他修建了汴新支綫，簡直想把鄭州的位置，以新鄉取而代之，原因是那時新鄕是他們的直對太行山的一個西進基地。新鄕的幾條闊大的馬路，都是敵人所開闢的，幾座高大洋房，都是敵人建築的。因此，D·D·T。已經銷遍全國，而新鄉人終還是用敵人發明的「蠅必立死」來驅除蚊蠅，雖然是僞造的。</p>
<p>我到新鄉，正値縣長李奎光被綏區撤職査辦不久，這是實施總體戰後，河南綏區使用職權第一砲。李縣長之被撤職，據說是因爲縣府的一個科長販運軍火資匪，而縣長有通謀的嫌疑。新鄕參議會列舉八大罪狀，照那上面說，李奎光簡直是罪不容誅。接任的夏治英縣長，是十二綏區行政公署的經濟處長，新鄕人，他吿訴我：一上任，先裁去縣屬機關的冗員一千五百餘人，另外，他澈査城廂四保的帳目，有一個保長上任未及兩月，舞弊了一萬三千五百斤的小麥，按現價折合，達二百四十餘億。保中帳目中，正常支出部份，包括他們的香烟，洗澡，請客等費。</p>
<p>保鎮長的貪汚，成爲新鄕人於負担政府徭役之餘的一個更大的創痛。有一位店舖中的老闆和我談：他有一些地在鄕間，保辦公處派到糧款，都有些還價。從去年秋季到今年春季，他的田上應攤糧五百六十七斤，結果保長答應以四百二十斤了事。他問保長：少繳的一百多斤，你怎辦？保長答得妙：因爲顧慮到每家繳不齊，只有多攤一些，留個退步。</p>
<p>我去新鄉，商會和裝會，正爲攤派閙着蹩扭，過去的一切省公糧，縣公糧，代購軍糧差價……等，按成例由商界負担百分之二十五，由田地負祖百分之七十五。可是現在大商店都關了，商會請求調整比率，三個月的磋商，決定商會負担百分之十五，農會負祖百分之八十五。於是本年一月到五月的公糧軍糧，商會照規定攤出八千石。忽然，農會又不承認新比率，要推翻前議，商店方面則以罷市表示抗議。專員公署則忙着請客，張敬忠專員折衝於樽俎之間，來解決這一塲糾紛。</p>
<p>在新鄉，碰到一位同業，他忙着吿訴我一句話：新鄉暗殺多。果然，第二天報紙上刊出了汲縣</p>
<p>街總隊副總隊長王協和，二十九日於由新返汲途中被害。</p>
<p>暗殺風氣的盛行，與論界也受到了威脅。新鄉僅有的一家用土紙印的報紙，上月底爲了刋載一件讀者投書，牽涉了鎭保長貪汚的事，第二天便有一羣人找報館講斤頭，大打記者，並以危言恐嚇。我看到現在大中報社的大門裏，築起一座碉堡，添了一個衛兵。</p>
<p>這次沁河決口，加上大雨數日，山洪暴發，造成豫北空前的水災，新鄕災况，雖不頂嚴重，但是秋收已經打了一個折扣，小麥漲到近四百萬一斗，新焦路斷了一年多，大炭已漲到十萬元一斤，逢到一堆人談話，少不了一聲：「日子怎過？」秋天快來了，冬天也自不遠，新鄕人日來互相先以新焦段搶修的消息，加上聽說河南的軍糧已經政府豁免，他們正期待着一個溫飽的冬天！</p>

<h3>美國大選前奏曲（二）　范登堡的憤怒</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>〔本報紐約七月廿五日航訊〕杜魯門在民主黨的全國代表大會席上，接受黨員推舉爲總統候選人時作過一次相當嚮亮的演講，他說：他執政期內，遭逢的最大的困難，是共和黨國會的阻難。聯邦政府對敎育發展的不够重視，全美國「房荒」問題，到現在沒有完全解決，物價上漲和通貨膨脹，沒有辦法制止，都因爲共和黨控制着的國會，處處阻難。他說，他自始至終，反對塔虎脫的勞工法案，因爲損害勞工的權益，但是共和黨國會堅持通過又通過。他說他仍然將爲民主黨的旣定政綱政策而鬥爭。</p>
<p>杜魯門的詞意，和巴克萊的演講貫連一氣。巴克萊，這位七十高齡的肯塔基老參議員，是七月中旬費城民主黨大會表演最精彩的一個。巴克萊那篇長演講，振振有詞，頗對民主黨本身，出了一口氣。他痛斥共和黨對民主黨在宣傳上的「惡意攻擊」，他替羅斯福總統當年的「新政」翻案。他說到一九三二年胡佛時代的美國的悲慘的境况，「幸虧有羅斯福總統的高明的新經濟政策，才把美國的大局挽救過來」。他說：「今天共和黨人昧着良知，處處造成宣傳，駡我們做新政派，使美國人聽了，彷彿新政派就是洪水猛獸。我們民主黨人和美國的愛國國民，不要爲這種惡意攻擊所纏誤。我國就是新政派，因爲美國有羅斯福的新政，才有今天的局面」！</p>
<p>巴克萊拿今天和一九三二年相比擬，也替杜魯門政府做了辯護。當天，杜魯門從白宮電賀他演講成功。那時候，正是副總統問題爭特不決的刹那，杜魯門原想請大理院的一大法官一道格拉斯出馬，道格拉斯原先很受人擁戴「出任總統候選人，以替代庸懦的杜魯門」。道格拉斯住在西岸，他謝絕一切擁戴。參議員麥弘男，傳說當副總統候選人最早，但他是「中西部」人，跟杜魯門一樣。杜魯門自己的意思，是要找一位東部或四海岸的副總統，做他的競選搭當，這原是根據民主常軌的想法。</p>
<p>但是，巴克萊一篇演講以後，陡然博得羣衆的無限擁戴，副總統候選人，沒有經過爭持，就落到巴古萊身上。就民主黨本身說，巴克萊出馬做杜魯門的『競選伴侶』。是有百害而無一利的。原因是，（一）巴克萊是肯塔基州人，來自中部，與東西海岸無關。就地域觀點看，東西海岸人口較密，選民較衆，民主黨將因而喪失選票。（二）巴克萊今年七十高齡，做副總統候選人，殊嫌過份年高，固然巴克萊的老當益壯，和法國的萊翁勃倫不相上下，但究竟前年萊翁勃倫的嘗試『組閣』，在法國國會中還是失敗。這次巴克萊決定接受推選以前，民主黨若干『黨務老闆』（在美國統稱鮑斯），像新澤西州的海格，芝加哥的阿維，都勸巴克萊『三思而行』。他們的意見是：七十高齡再不該擋住『賢路」，把機會讓給年靑後進。但結果仍然無效。</p>
<p>就大體論，如果民主黨的十一月大選必將失敗，則『競選伴侶』的年青或年邁，都無喪大雅。據杜魯門自己表示，他對十一月大選的『勝利』，甚有信心，因爲他認爲他在內政上不能大刀闊斧的做，不是他行政機構的過失，而是共和黨第八十屆國會的不給他順利通過。他自信美國國民應該明瞭他這種苦衷，而仇視共和黨。因此，他從費城回到白宮以後，第一項措施，　是下令召開國會上下兩院特別會議，商討內政緊急方案。</p>
<p>白宮新聞處告訴記者們：民主黨大會結束那天，總統從費城趕回華盛頓，他晚上十二點半到達，淸晨五點鐘，已經看見總統坐在白宮的辦公室裏，許多人猜想大槪總統整晚沒有睡覺，他現在要開始『如臨大敵』一樣，跟堅强的共和黨陣容決鬥。</p>
<p>按照美國的慣例，每年夏季國會上下兩院都得休假，和中國現在的立法院一樣。美國憲法規定總統如遇必要時，有權在國會休會期間，召集特別會議，以急商國家之要政。據紐約時報首都特派員諾爾斯的報導：「一個正在競選下屆總統的現任總統，於國會休會期間，突然召集特別會議，在美國歷史上還是破天荒第一次。但是，杜魯門總統居然做了」！</p>
<p>共和黨對總統的國會特別會議召集令，起了强烈的反感。華盛頓的共和黨人士，稱杜魯門這一手，是耍『小權術』『小陰謀』，有人稱杜魯門在玩『低級的政治把戯』。尤其感到憤慨的，是正在密歐根度夏的范登堡。范登堡告訴合衆社的記者說：『杜魯門這一個召集令，是一個埀亡政權臨終以前的歇斯的里的喘息』，他說：『我不相信有什麼天大的緊急事件，要召集那末一次特別會議來討論！』</p>
<p>像范登堡那樣有聲望，有份量的老政治家，從來不發牢騷，不開口駡人，這回對杜魯門的『小權謀』，大槪是我看到他第一次憤慨。但是他還是要去華盛頓出席，他們決不放鬆自己　有的資任。</p>
<p>國會特別會議，明天就要開幕，距離杜魯門下的召集令，僅十一天，杜魯門在七月十四日民主黨費城代表大會上，接受推戴的演講中，痛駡了共和黨控制的國會。他還說：今天蒙民主黨全黨同志仍然推選他競選下屆總統，他一定要貫澈黨的主張，他要在十五天之內，實現這些主張，而且完成立法手續。</p>
<p>黨的決策運川到政治上來，杜魯門在七月十四日半夜回華府，十五日一大早就下令召集國會特別會議。巴克萊那時候還留在費城，他聽到這召集令，高興萬分，他翹起大姆指：「好勇敢的總統，做得對！』</p>
<p>當然　，杜魯門在特別會議裏，會張起喉嚨，表現最精彩的一手。增加敎育經費囉，撥款建造房屋囉，救濟歐洲難民囉，開放移民限制　，制止通貨膨脹囉，厲行物價管制　，凡是美國人民今天要求政府的話，統統將要由杜魯門嘴上傳佈到國會，國會不肯通過，那是國會的資任。誰是國會的多數黨？誰操縱著國會？美國人民都知道是共和黨！杜魯門這一手當然很『辣』，但也很厲害！</p>
<p>共和黨怎樣應付呢！當然要費相當的腦筋。杜魯門的召集令頒佈那天，塔虎脫會見杜威，他們當然有一個密談。外面傳說：共和黨議員將在聽完杜魯門演說以後，立刻提議『休會』，給杜魯門來一個冷臉，冷臉對杜魯門的法案到無所謂，但美國的每一個納說公民，要分攤負祖二十二萬二千美金的一筆大旅費。據紐約每日新聞的報導！旅費包括參議院和衆議院，參議院九十六位議員，來回旅費共計五萬一千元。衆議員四百三十五人，來回旅費十七萬一千元。</p>
<p>二十二萬多塊錢，在美國國庫支出中，眞是微不足道。問題在於這次『特別會議』，可能使民主，共和兩黨的競選更尖銳化，再加上華萊士的第三黨，南方的第四黨，使美國十一月競選的畫面，更生動，更緊張起來了！</p>

<h3>新煙葉已登塲　煙商紛往採辦</h3>
<p>本市煙葉行，近以各地新煙陸續登塲，為供應本市各捲煙　所需原料，並爲自身營業進展計，已紛紛派員向各產區採辦薰烟土烟等上品烟葉。其路綫幾遍及全國。過去執國內烟葉市塲牛耳之河南訐昌，因迭遭戰火，產量及聲譽已大不如前。目前所能裝運來滬者，尙係過去漢口等地之有貨。而雲南昆明一帶烟葉，由於栽培得宜，所產烟葉品質佳良，今已駕於許昌葉之上，其售價亦最昻貴。除昆明許昌兩地烟葉外，其次當推靑州鳳隔所產。再次採辦目標多集中於蚌埠鳳陽葉，截至目前，已有二十餘家商行先後派遣採辦員採辦新烟，惟因收購接洽及交通運輸關係，預期新烟當在二個月後方可抵滬。</p>
<h3>東北匯款激增</h3>

<p>輸管會爲配合政府改革幣制，於昨日下午召集本市各出口業領袖，舉行談話會，由該會輸出推廣處長陳　人主持，中央銀行等亦派員出席。會議內容，爲討論配合政府整理財政及加緊管制經濟之具體步驟。</p>
<p>據稱：政府此次實行幣制改革，對於出口業大有裨益，我國各項出口物資，將可大量輸出。但政府爲避免出口商彼此效爭傾銷起見，決實施出口限價辦法，以穩定國外市塲，而爭取外匯，並維持出口商之利益。至出口限價辦法，將以本月十九日之國外行情爲限價標準，例如天津五五號長鬃，每磅CIF美金九元六角，桐油每磅CIF美金二角，黄荳每噸上海FOB三十七英碎等。席間出口商要求當局以後結匯價格，依新幣四元對一美元，扣除原有之外匯基準價（舊法幣四十七萬四千元），並對於出口貸款利息，要求减低，依戰前利息計算，開當局對此均已有決策，日內即可公佈云。</p>
<h3>輸管會發表　上週出口情形</h3>
<p>國內外行市繼續上漲</p>
<p>輸管會昨發表，八月八日至十四日一週間，出口及結匯情形如下：八日至十四日，出口貨國內行市仍承上週漲勢步升，平均較上週漲百分之二十七，國外行布一般均平穩，僅天津廿六號及漢口十七號猪鬃。羽毛等稍漲，大豆桐油則跌。結匯證價市氣仍秀，週杪達七七〇萬，全週平均約爲六，六五五，〇〇〇元，較上週增百分之十七。如以週初國內外行市與當時結匯證計算，滬漢猪鬃·羽毛·腸衣·蛋品·輸出可獲利，生牛皮尤高，至天津　·食油·紗布·中藥·五棓子等，因國內漲價過鉅，各有虧損。茲將主要出口品，本週僵出市况，略誌於下：</p>
<p>桐油　國外行市穩，紐約C．I．F．每磅上落於美金一角九分五與二角之間，上海F．O．B．每磅僅美金一角七分又四分之一，週初外銷虧損約二成，但因內地及華南等處市價遠低於上海，本埠桐油出口商多有向各處採購者，聞每日運滬達四千担，七月份經港出口亦增加。</p>
<p>豬鬃　國外行情稍好，漢十七號及津廿六號短貨均漲，週一C．I．F．紐約價格，每磅分別爲美金四元四角及六元六角，其他無變化。外銷漢鬃獲利校較高，約百分之廿五，滬鬃略敷成本，餘均有虧損。七月份經港出口尙活躍，並有輸往日本易貨者。</p>
<p>茶葉　　到貨少，市價挺秀，珍眉針眉特真等貨，海外需求甚殷，但給價吝嗇，市况仍停頓。台茶近聞有大戶收購運　，價亦勁升，運港者轉稀。</p>
<p>生絲　國外市況平靜，D級貨每磅C．I．F．紐約美金三元，上海F．O．B．價格二元八角，輸出稍有虧損，惟因結匯證看好，輸出已開始活動，市塲仍在美國，成交量甚微。</p>
<p>豬腸衣　週初十三碼半每副國內價格較上週漲二成，國外平穩，爲上海F．O．B．B．價格美金一角八分又四分之三，因　匯證價升高，輸出獲利仍達百分之二十二。</p>
<p>羽毛　國內外價格均升，鴨毛及鵝毛上海F．O．B．，每磅分別漲爲美金三角七分五及五角三分五，出口獲利約一成左右。</p>
<p>紗布　及紡織品，國內軋漲雖烈，國外則平穩，南洋方面如印尼等需要甚切，但以原棉漲價供應困難，國內工廠維持甚感威脅，出口難望樂觀</p>
<p>礦砂　外銷情形轉趨活潑，蓋美對我錫銻需要增加之故，官商均有裝運赴港者，南洋印席等地商人前往港埠辦貨者頗多，我遷港工廠亦有需要，故在港實銷轉暢。</p>

<h3>世運籃球隊得意作　一分勝韓國記</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鐘震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕倫敦自昨天大雨後，天氣已變得非常凉爽，猶如深秋一般。據久居英國的人說，這是標準英倫三鳥的天氣。</p>
<p>吾國籃球隊自昨日（八月二日）戰勝比利時隊後，今天晚上九時，又在哈林蓋健身房與韓國隊作首次循環賽。該隊聯絡迅速純熟，射籃準確，若論球藝，實勝中華隊一籌，故自開塲迄最後一秒鐘，高麗隊始終佔先，終於天佑吾軍，在最後一秒鐘中，左鋒世僑以神出鬼沒之神射，在十碼外以翻身單手擲入，球剛離手，時間吿終，遂判定吾國中華隊勝利。如此驚心動魄之比賽，實爲本屆世運籃球賽所未有。吾國籃球隊以二次獲勝，異邦人仕，刮目相視，亦可爲吾國出席世運代表團吐氣揚眉，吿幫國人。今將比賽經過錄次：</p>
<p>吳成章　李世僑</p>
<p>蔡文華</p>
<p>李震中　黃天錫　　志軍　包松圓</p>
<p>韓國隊一路領先</p>
<p>開球後，韓隊聲勢極盛，以迅速傳遞之姿態，連進二球。吾軍蔡文華犯規，又復被罰進一球，高麗隊在三分鐘內，即以五比〇佔先。吾軍急起反攻，李世僑遙射，擦的入網，黄天錫躍起折擲，扳回二球。高麗隊回攻，連以美妙技術，投進數球，吾軍仍以六比十四，相差八分之多。此後中華滕員略形慌張，陣勢更鬆，罰球屢次不進。加以蔡文華在上場時，社中即略有隱痛，故素有把握之遙射，竟告失常。雖經李世僑吳成章之竭力支持，無濟於事。上半時結束時，高麗隊以二十八對十六遙遙佔前。休息時。吾國觀衆與隊員均懊喪不堪。但平心而論，吾中華隊之敗績，應無怨言。高麗隊隊員非但體力充分平均，而聯絡亦極默契，加以投籃準確，吾軍實無獲勝之可能。</p>
<p>李震中老將全塲</p>
<p>下半時易地後，吾軍攻勢仍疲莫能興。指導宋君復，即調遣老將李震中上塲，以易黄天錫，局勢果形好轉。李震中遙射中的，指揮得當，不愧籃球元老。右鋒吳成童又以迅速姿態，以一口氣連進二球，局勢漸見轉佳。但終因實力懸殊，欲求戰勝，實無把握。至最後一刻鐘時，黄天錫重復進塲，賈志軍替代包松圓。吾軍再度奮力反攻，誓志欲戰勝高麗，爲吾國爭光，終於天從人願，在最後五分鐘時，三十九對四十一祗相差一球。此時二旁看台上中外觀衆，一致狂喊「中國隊加汕」。但頃刻間，曇花一現，高麗隊又以四十七比四十一佔前。此時老將李震中又復上塲，努力指揮，一舉反攻，在最後三分鐘時，李世僑吳成章相繼建功，分數扶搖直上，又以四十七比四十八祗有一分之差。</p>
<p>李世僑起死回生</p>
<p>終局時間頃刻即到，千鈞一髮之際，左鋒李世僑，忽然在距籃十碼之地，躍起翻身單手一擲，竟告中的，而球剛離手，記錄員之秒針，正指十二時，鐘聲一響，時吿終塲，判定中華隊以四十九比四十八戰勝高麗隊。此時觀衆掌聲雷動，采聲不絕，觀衆球員之熱烈情况，實非筆墨所能形容。吾國籃球隊員李世僑，以此神射，使異邦人仕大加激賞，高呼爲「中國神童」，因其年稚而身材亦小。但右鋒吳成章及中鋒蔡文華之功勞，亦不容抹然。明日下午七時將與勁敵菲列賓對抗。菲列賓實力雄厚，但以今日下午以六十八比三十九大敗於智利之手，看來明日戰局，或有希望。若能三勝他國，我國可進入決賽，當爲我世運隊之空前收穫。</p>
<h3>公開綱球　高級單打</h3>
<p>蔡國衡今戰周冠軍</p>
<p>公開網球錦標賽，今爲第八日，高級單打已剩最後八人，今日起展開半複賽，第一塲爲陶冠球對謝兆良，第二塲爲蔡國衡對周冠軍，下午四時起在舉山路六七六號（舊四五四號）靑年網球塲舉仃，門票每劵二百萬元。今明秋序如下：</p>

<h3>世運五彩片　加國語說明</h3>
<p>九月底可來中國</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦二十日電〕英國所攝世運會五彩影片，由前負責攝製伊麗莎伯公主婚禮影片之奈依特專司其事，約於九月底可銷至遠東國家。說明亦在印製中，用英文說明者，送往香港新加坡兩地，銷至中國者則用國語說明，該片約可放映一小時之久，各國觀衆均可見及本國選手之動態。倫敦方面定於九月三日首輪放映，九月一日美國海外航空公司將携此片若干拷貝，運往紐約，並將空運至美國七十七城市內放映。英國航空公司則携加有十七國語言說明之拷貝，運往海外三十國。</p>

<p>小貓藍—粤東（乙組）下午五時</p>
<h3>世運籃球隊　在曼谷受挫　三五對四一敗於華僑隊</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷十九日電〕過份自信之中國世運籃球隊，今日在此以四十一對三十五敗於華僑選手隊。本日適爲廢曆七月十五日中元節，觀衆空前擁擠。世運隊第一節以十一對八領先，第二節終了，華僑隊反以十八對十七佔優。大多數觀衆認爲世運隊太客氣，主隊球遝過佳。第三節包松圓入塲，華僑隊仍獲十三分，客隊僅獲六分。世運隊於驚詫之餘，第四節以蔡忠强入替，與包松圓合作，比數曾一度接近至三十五比三十三，然主隊仍佔先，終賴其好運以四十一對三十五擊敗世運隊。世運隊昨日下午抵此，旅程勞頓，李世僑黃天錫二將又缺席，此乃失敗主因。</p>

<h3>朱自清的散文</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>因爲朱氏之死，不免又把朱氏的散文拿來重讀。我覺得朱氏的文軍早年與晚年顯有差異，這恐怕不只朱氏一人如此，也不只敵文一部門如此，任何作家，少作和成名以後的作品，往往都有極大的不同，若是思想，甚至更會前後判若兩人。</p>
<p>初期散文的作家，大約都是有過長期寫作文言文歷史的，一如初期新詩作家全是舊詩詞家一樣。所以，那時的散文，總像不能脫略文言的胎息，達到「用筆如舌」的地步（這是朱氏在「說話」一文中的主張）。最顯明的是朱氏與兪氏在一九二三年所作的「槳聲燈影裏的秦淮河」，那不但是舊式散文的餘息，而且更飄搖着舊詩詞的餘味。請看有下面的句子，可是今日散文中常見的嗎？</p>
<p>「……但燈光究竟奪不了那邊的月色燈光是渾的，月色是淸的，在澤沌的燈光裏，滲入一派淸輝，却眞是奇蹟！那晚的月兒已瘦削了兩三分，她晚粧才罷，盈盈的上了柳梢頭；天是藍得可愛，彷彿一汪水似的，月兒便更落得精神了。……但燈與月竟能】並存着，交融着，使月成了纏綿的月，燈射着渺渺的靈輝，這正是天之所以厚秦淮河，也正是天之所以厚我們了。」</p>
<p>這種句子竟比永州八記的彎子轉得還多，也頗像宋人慢詞。若與朱氏最流行的「背影」一篇相比較，顯然是兩個類型。而老實說，朱氏是並不喜歡和接近此一型的，所以我們感覺他這一篇文草寫的並不理想。譬如後來所寫的歐游雜記就不是這個調子。原來自新的散文初興即有兩派路子，若即以朱氏的作品爲例，正是一爲背影型，一爲秦淮月型，屬於背影型者極多，屬於後者的，除兪平伯氏之外，又有廢名，何其芳諸位，實在有些由澀味而入於隱晦，使人不能明白了。</p>
<p>兪平伯近來已極少寫散文，不敢懸斷其作風有何轉變，反正初期是受舊詩詞影響頂深的，看與朱氏同作的秦淮一題自明；至於朱氏，說是絢綱之極歸於平淡也可以，說是愈來愈近於他的本色也可以，總之，近些年的作品，眞可以說是作到了由博反約，由造作趨於純任自然的形式。氏在「說話」一文中云：</p>
<p>「說話即使不比作文難，也決不比作文易，有些人會說話不會作文，但也有些人會作文不會說話。說話像行雲流水，不能够一個字一個字的推敲，因而不免有疏漏散漫的地方，不如作文的謹嚴；但那行雲流水般的自然，却又非一般文章所及——文實有能到這境界的，簡直當以說話論，不再是文章了，但這是怎樣一個不易到的境界！……」</p>
<p>這幾句話不啻他的創作理論，也可以說是他最近寫作的指標，行雲流水的境界固不易到，然而朱氏的淸新流走，確是可以達到此一境界。我很同意他在「飛」裏邊的兩段話：</p>
<p>「不錯，海洋裏可以看日出和日落，但是得有運氣，日出和日落全靠雲霞烘托才有意思，不然，一輪呆呆的日頭簡直是大傻瓜！雲霞烘托雖也常有，但往往淡淡的，懶懶的，那還是沒意思。得濃，得變，一眨眼一個花樣，層出不窮，才有看頭，這是可遇而不可求的。……天空跟海一樣，也大，也單調，日月星的，雲叢的文學和藝術似乎不少，都是下之視上，說到整個兒天空的却不多。星空，夜空，還有點兒，畫空除了『靑天』『明藍的晴天』或『陰沉沉的天』一類詞兒之外，好像再沒有什麽說的。但是初次坐飛機的人雖無多少文學華術的背景帮助他的想象，却總還有那『天空任鳥飛』的想象，加上別人的經驗，上之視下，似乎不只是蒼蒼而已，也有那翻騰的雲海，也有那平舖的錦　，這就够揣摩的。</p>
<p>軾拿此種境界形容朱氏的作品，你道是個呆呆的優瓜似的太陽嗎？不是不是，沒有那麼狂熱和刺眼；你道他是一片藍天嗎？不是不是，不像那麽停滯而靜默；他正是飛機上所看的雲海，一眨眼一個花樣的初陽，不懂的人只覺得很平常，有點文學夙養的人却覺得出那「翻騰的雲海」和「平舖的錦繡」供給了我們無窮的意象。（你再比比那筆調，和前面所引的一樣嗎？）</p>
<p>朱氏剛五十歲就長逝了，其未來的成就絕不止此。希望靑年們在散文這方面有以繼續先哲的餘緒，不要像南京某報似的，弄一篇一竅不通的文言祭文來祭他，如果他的「學生」全像這樣，朱氏死也不會瞑目了！</p>
<h3>談考試作弊</h3>
<p>— 蔣宗禹</p>
<p>在科舉式的考試制度之下，進大學的確不是一件容易事，加之近十年來社會經濟的崩潰，爲了减輕家庭的担負，國立大學的門檻更顯得森　可畏了。我們每每有到靑年們自己甚至其父兄們常常挖空了心思想　種種方法使自己或子弟可以「金榜題名」。最普通的方法當然是「請託」之風，所以每年入學考試的前後，校長，敎務長以及敎授們都可以收到積案盈尺的「小兒，苦親×××有志深造，苦於不得其門」之類情殊可憫的介紹信。然而正因爲介紹者的衆多，取　實在不易，結果就只有被「可能範圍之內，盡量帮忙」而擱置一邊了。因此，請託之風雖盛，恐怕效力却很少。自從這個最簡易最堂皇的方法失效之後，隨着時代的進步，繼之而起的花樣更日新月異了。什麽夾帶，儉看別人，翻書本，都已陳腐不堪，而且並無把握，危險性太大，雖然考試塲中仍可見到這些花樣，但都是些「可憐」的「後知後覺」者，早爲「前進的」「發明家」們所不齒了。</p>
<p>第一稱新方法是「改良的代考」。這種手法的關鍵是在報名時核對報名單與證書上相片的時候能否混過。只要所請的代考者面貌無顯著的歧異，或是通過照相的技術之後，在報名擁擠人多手雜的情形之下，職員先生更疲於那種機械的工作，常常會忽略過去的。此關若過，考試時便可毫無顧慮了。但錄取之後，有許多學校是要騐筆跡的，然而大都是個形式而已，即使有點小問題，都能以考試時心情不同，鋼筆不同等等理由混過去的。筆者是個進入大學尙不甚久的學生，所見到的這種事實，已有多次。</p>
<p>第二種是交換試卷。這是所謂「陪考」方法中的一種。兩個人報考同一個學系，將來考試時一的坐位縱有間隔，相去亦不甚遠。當分配試卷時，他們老早守候在試塲進口的第一棧，等到鐘聲初響，兩人便很快的互相跑到另一人釣坐位，在衆人如潮湧一般走進試塲的時候，便可在混亂中互携換過的試卷走到自己原定的位置。這種情形常在數百人以上的大試塲中發生。</p>
<p>另外更有最進步的「護航」，預先請好兩三個甚至五六個「名手」同時報名，大規模的「陪考」。雖然考試時的坐號不能究全在一起，只要其中有一人能在左右，則目的已達。在目前地狹人多的試塲中，坐位與坐位之間，幾乎沒有距離，所以如交換試卷，側目照抄，無不稱心如意，可謂集各種舞弊方法的大成。</p>
<p>考試的作弊，恐怕自古而然，於今尤烈吧！筆者見識有限，收羅未盡，自所難免，不過這已足够使人驚異了。這都是時代和制度下的產物。負責敎育的先生們，你們如果認爲考試制度仍有存在的價値，則此種現象應當注意。否則，就應當在根本加以商酌了。</p>
<h3>美國點滴</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>美國存在海外的剩餘物資已經賣掉了百分之九十八，這些物資原來的價値是一百零五億四千七百八十四萬五千美元，美政府以二折出售，可得款十九億六千二百八十萬零四千美元。美國的農塲在種植樹苗前，現在都先把樹苗通渦振動率極高的超音波，據說可以使樹的成長加速。凡曾通過超音彼的洋山芋，成熟都比普通的山芋爲早，而且這種洋山芋特別大，</p>
<p>美國亦實施日光節約時間，本年定於九月二十六日終止。但加利福尼亞和尼伐大二州則爲了要節省電力，準備一直延長到明年正月才恢復正常時間。</p>
<p>美國退伍軍人的犯罪率激增。目前聯邦監獄中的罪犯們有四分之之一以上都是參加過第二次世界大戰的退伍軍人，而州立監獄中，這些退伍軍人所佔的比率竟有超過半數者。</p>
<p>美國近年來頗感皮革恐慌，最近特從暹羅和印度空運了三萬張蛇皮，供製造婦女們的鞋子，手袋，腰帶……等物之用。</p>
<h3>護鬚套</h3>
<p>— 安如</p>
<p>小時候讀三國演義，有一段至今還能記得，就是關雲長的鬍子套。</p>
<p>據演義上說：漢獻帝看見了關公奇長無比的美髯，大爲發生興趣，問長問短，關公就說，他每夜陲覺的時候，常常在胸口掛一個長袋，把鬍子放在裏面，以資保護。</p>
<p>我當時常想，倒不知道這種鬍子袋是什麽樣子的—太寬闊了就並不能保護鬍子，太狹小了那就放鬍子時不大方便。不過，總覺得這件事情的本身倒極有意思。</p>
<p>不想，在四十五年以前（一九〇四），有一個美國人大槪聽見過別人講三國演義，竟抄襲了關公的老文章，居然攘爲己有，說是自己新發明了「護鬚套」，特地向美國專門登記新發明和辦理專利權的機關（專利局）去註了册—可惜至今無人賞識，他的發明終於落了空。</p>
<h3>靜坐經騐談（四）</h3>
<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>靜坐法的科學解釋</p>
<p>靜坐法原是中國古代道家所謂「內功」，是不是可以用近代科學的說法來解釋呢？我說是可以的。自然我的科學知識極淺陋，未必眞正能說出道理來，但也不妨粗淺的說一說看。</p>
<p>人的身體本來是有兩種神經系統，一爲動物性神經系，一爲植物性神經系，動物性神經司人的知覺和運動，植物性神經則分佈於內部諸　及血管，與動物性相聯屬，故又稱交感神經。動物性的神經中樞是腦部，如是用腦過度，一定要感到疲勞；如要安慰勞，一定要休息。休息的方法，在一般人看，當然是睡眼了。假使不用睡眠，另外還有一種特殊方法，可以使腦神經中樞以及全部　　皆能得到休息，並且是眞正休息，（因爲睡眠時，還有夢，不能算眞正休息。）此種休息，能每天有一次，每次有五十分鐘乃至一小時，推想起來，對於人體健康的恢復及增進，一定有很大的帮助，這是可以由常識來斷定的。靜坐法的擯絕思慮，萬念俱空，一時使全部鉀經，內不起一點念慮，外與事物接觸斷絕，這不是最好的一個休息方法麼？但是，僅僅休息使神經作用暫停，那還是消極的，比如一個國家的政治機能，暫時停止外交工作，是可以的，但不能不修治內政，並且內政眞正修治得好，將來辦起外交來一定也是格外順利，格外有益，所謂修治內政，那便是深細呼吸的腹部運動了。</p>
<p>原來腹部內臟的神經，是屬於植物性的，牠平時和外界很少直接的接觸，但牠和腦神經是具有密切關聯的，且分佈在各處血管。再以國家政治機構來作比喩吧：牠在人體內的作用，如同國家的交通運輸，當然對於國內一切政治，關係是異常重要。要修治內政，無疑的先應該把全部交通運輸，整理得十分健全，十分靈活。人體在腹部有所謂內臟動脈軸叢，（Plexus　coeliacuss　colore），在骨盤部有所謂下腹叢（Plekus　bypoqostvicus），其交感神經的分佈，最多亦最密，可說是人體中最重要的交通遝輸樞紐。可是，平常人們對於牠的整理鍛鍊，工夫郤用得很少，那也就是無異乎國家修治內政，對於交通運輸機關，未能十分注意加功了，這當然是不對的。我們練習體操以及從事各種健身運動，自然是很要緊，但牠所鍜鍊的，還是外部的皮膚，筋肉，骨骼，很少直接影響到內臟，可見這種修治內政的工夫，似乎還嫌不大够吧。假使另有一種特殊方法，能不斷的對於交感神經予以刺激，予以鍛鍊，使牠的機能增進，活力加强，自然可以促進全部新陳代謝，可以增加全體生活動力，那末，用深細呼吸，以進行腹部的內臟運動，那就是爲完成這種功用了。可以說，習體操及從事各項運動，工夫是「外鑠」的，不妨稱牠做「外功」，而此種腹部內臟運動，工夫是「內發」的，所以中國自古以來，即稱做「內功」。自然外功也是極重要，而且是極有價値的，他不但有健身的功能，附帶的還有德育，羣育，美育的效用包含在內。不過「外功」已爲一般人所熟知，而「內功」則是一種極古老的方法，多不爲人所重視所確信，我所以於自己經騐以後，還不嫌詞費，且自忘淺陋，特地再用粗疏的科學說法，把牠證明出來。當然所說的不完不備之處很多，說不定還有些錯誤地方，甚盼科學專家有以敎我。</p>

<h3>Currency Reform Only Allows Success: The President's Earnest Explanation of Essential Points, Instructing Mutual Trust and Cooperation Between the Government and the People</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The President, considering the great impact of the promulgated Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy on the lives of the nation and its people, and to ensure its smooth implementation and the complete achievement of its intended goals, held a tea party at the Lizi Society in the capital at 4:30 PM on the 20th. He invited figures from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of Beijing and Shanghai, earnestly explaining the importance of these measures and his hopes for these individuals. The President began by stating: "The reform of the currency system was something we discussed at the beginning of our victory and recovery. However, it was not implemented due to certain issues. Now, with the determination and thorough preparations of Premier Weng and Finance Minister Wang, it is being officially announced and implemented today. This measure has a great impact on the lives of the people. Once implemented, it must succeed and cannot fail. The most important thing is that the government and the people can trust and cooperate with each other. We also hope that the financial sector can lead and assist, so that the government's policies can be assisted and the task completed." The President also stated: "The maximum amount of the new currency to be issued is 2 billion, equivalent to 500 million US dollars. The reserves are 40% in gold, silver, and foreign currency, totaling over 300 million, and 60% in goods, totaling 300 million. The subsidiary currency can be backed by the copper from Japanese reparations, which is also worth 100 million US dollars. Therefore, the guarantee is undoubtedly sufficient. We hope that the industrial and commercial sectors can lead and cooperate." After the President's speech, Xu Jiyu, Qin Hanqing, and Pan Gongzhan each delivered speeches. Xu and Qin expressed their determination to support the government's policies and work together to achieve success. Finally, Pan Gongzhan, as a representative of public opinion, delivered a speech offering suggestions, emphasizing the establishment of a psychological foundation. There must be mutual trust between the government and the people, working as one, which will surely lead to success. Secondly, there should be a cyclical system for prices, wages, and interest rates. To stabilize prices and wages simultaneously, it is essential to suppress interest rates. Pan also stated: "The implementation of this measure is the key to the survival of the people and the government. We hope that the government will especially trust legitimate industry and commerce, especially trade associations, so that the promotion of the new currency system will be successfully achieved." Pan also emphasized that the responsibilities of the Currency Reform and Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee must be taken seriously. Its decisions should be respected, and its inspection and supervision should be carried out with a detached and independent attitude, ensuring openness and impartiality. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Premier Weng Convenes a Discussion Meeting, Encouraging All Sectors to Jointly Promote Major Decisions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, invited responsible persons from national agencies and bureaus, as well as figures from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors of Beijing and Shanghai, and representatives of public opinion, to discussion meetings on the 20th, both in the morning and afternoon. He explained the key points of the implementation of the measures and what he hoped from these individuals. The discussion meeting with figures from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors of Beijing and Shanghai was held at 3 PM on the 20th. Weng, along with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu and Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian, attended. Weng delivered a speech first, followed by reports from Ministers Wang and Chen. All were promoting the decision-making of the emergency measures for finance and economy, hoping that everyone could unite and assist in promoting this major government decision, believing that it would surely succeed. Subsequently, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, spoke, raising concerns about the issues of prices and wages after the currency reform, and hoping that the government would have a thorough plan to assist in successfully achieving the mission. The meeting adjourned around 4 PM. It is learned that the participants in the meeting included Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Jiang Jingguo, Lin Chongyong, Xu Jiyu, Qin Runqing, Dai Mingli, and over thirty others. The key figures from Shanghai all rushed to Beijing on the 20th after receiving a telegram from Weng and returned to Shanghai that evening.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Premier Weng delivered a speech at the discussion meeting with figures from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, first explaining the important significance of the various measures in the emergency measures for finance and economy. He stated that since our victory and recovery, we have been listed as one of the five great powers, and the people should be able to share in peace and happiness. However, due to the disturbances caused by the Communist Party, industry and commerce have been hindered, leading to rising prices and making it difficult to control national treasury expenditures. This situation has shaken monetary credibility. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has formulated the emergency measures for finance and economy with the greatest determination, focusing on currency reform, aiming to strictly control the budget, balance national treasury revenue and expenditure, strengthen economic controls, stabilize market prices, and achieve the goal of stabilizing the economy and the people's livelihood. Secondly, Weng explained that the method of currency reform prioritizes restoring people's confidence in the currency. At the same time, a Currency Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee will be established to conduct monthly inspections and announcements to the whole country. Weng then emphasized the strict control of the national treasury budget, hoping that the people of the whole country would make joint efforts, firstly by strictly streamlining personnel and saving expenses in state-owned enterprises, and secondly by recognizing the current financial difficulties and actively paying taxes, assisting the government in eliminating concealment and leakage, ensuring that every penny goes to the public treasury. Finally, Weng reiterated that this emergency measure is a major reform for the government, which must be thoroughly implemented with all efforts. He hoped that everyone could work together with one heart and one mind to implement it, which is what he deeply hopes for.</p>
<h3>Responsible Persons of National Agencies and Bureaus Discuss Technical Issues of Currency Reform</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Premier Weng invited senior responsible persons from various national banks to a discussion meeting at the Executive Yuan at 9 AM on the 20th. Those present included Song Hanzhang, Xi Demao, Cheng Yuanfan, Shou Miancheng, Li Shuming, Zhao Dihua, and over ten others. Wang Yunwu and Xu Baiyuan also participated. Weng first reported on the progress of the currency reform, hoping that the responsible persons of the various national banks would jointly support and fully cooperate, so that the currency reform could be completely successful. Subsequently, the responsible persons of the various national agencies and bureaus exchanged views, expressing their support for the government's currency reform measures and raising some technical issues in implementation. They exchanged views on the methods of remittance rates, interest rates, loans, and the distribution of gold yuan certificates among the banks. No conclusions were reached at the adjournment, and it was decided that the Central Bank would reconvene a meeting with the various national agencies and bureaus on the 21st to discuss and decide. Xi Demao, Li Fusun, Zhao Dihua, Song Hanzhang, Cheng Yuanfan, Li Shuming, Shou Miancheng, Xu Baiyuan, and others all went to Shanghai on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Specific Implementation Measures for Controlling the Economy and Prices</h3>
<p>Being Drafted by the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are actively drafting some specific implementation and supplementary measures for the implementation of the measures for organizing finance and strengthening economic control. The Ministry of Finance has resumed a full-day office system starting on the 20th. In the morning, Wang Yunwu convened a meeting of the heads of relevant units to report on the key points of the currency reform and explain that some supplementary measures should be drafted quickly to strengthen implementation. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian also convened a meeting on the morning of the 20th with Vice Ministers Tong Jiling and Zhang Zizhu, as well as Director of the Control Department Fei Jianyang and Director of the Commerce Department Deng Hanliang, to discuss the issue of formulating specific implementation measures based on the emergency measures for finance and economy. In addition to reporting on the content of the currency reform plan, Chen also instructed the relevant departments to quickly formulate the specific implementation measures related to the plan within one or two days, and made the following instructions: (1) The emergency decree stipulates that prices are frozen at the gold yuan equivalent of the prices on August 19th. The specific implementation measures for price investigation and price limits/negotiations should be drafted by the Control Department. (2) Measures for prohibiting the sale of imported goods. (3) Measures for cracking down on hoarding and speculation. In the past, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had drafted measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. The Control Department should revise and strengthen them. As for the temporary suspension of business of the Tianjin and Shanghai Stock Exchanges, the measures for future resumption of business, and how to convert the registered capital of companies, the Commerce Department should jointly draft with the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>National Bank Capital: Maximum of One Million Gold Certificates</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] According to Article 30 of the measures for organizing finance and strengthening economic control in the emergency measures for finance and economy, the minimum capital amount of banks in various regions of the country should be drafted by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. It is learned that the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance has completed this measure and will submit it to Minister Wang for forwarding to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. This measure had been drafted earlier, but because the currency system has now been reformed, it is being drafted separately. It is reported that according to the conversion of gold yuan certificates, the maximum capital amount of banks is 1 million gold yuan certificates (before the war, it was 500,000 yuan, with 2 gold yuan certificates only equivalent to 1 yuan of legal currency before the war). Banks in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which belong to the first tier, must make up this amount of capital before they can continue to operate. The lowest area also requires 100,000 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Talk</h3>
<p>Strict Implementation of Reform Measures Can Make US Aid Plan Effective</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued a written statement on the 20th, saying: "The government announced a self-help plan a few months ago. The new decree is the main part of implementing this self-help plan. After my representative signed the bilateral economic aid agreement with the United States on July 3, I stated that I would do my best to make the Chinese government implement its responsibilities with the greatest sincerity. The reforms promulgated by the President's order on August 19th should be more successful during the implementation of this US aid plan, because the imbalance of international payments is one of the major difficulties of our country's currency reform. The implementation of the US aid plan can guarantee the supply of some important imported materials, so this major difficulty has been largely resolved at present. On the other hand, the adoption and strict implementation of this new reform measure should make the US aid plan more effective."</p>
<h3>Wang Yunwu Talks About the Gold Yuan Certificate Fund, Mainly Relying on Self-Reliance, Adjustment of Prices of State-Owned Enterprises is to Avoid Inflation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at 6 PM on the 20th, first announcing that before this currency reform, he had telegraphed the Executive Committee of the International Monetary Fund meeting, explaining that China had decided to reform the currency system and the brief key points of the reform. He has now received a reply, expressing admiration for our country's currency reform and believing that the measures are very appropriate, and wishing the reform success. Wang then answered questions from reporters. The main points are as follows: (1) State-owned enterprises are still allowed to adjust ticket prices according to pre-war standards in order to avoid inflation of the new currency. At the same time, no more subsidies will be given to state-owned enterprises, which is also a resolution of the Legislative Yuan. After the currency reform, although the people's income is not as good as before the war, or even half less than before the war, the price increase of state-owned enterprises is only based on the pre-war standard, not completely according to the pre-war standard. (2) Increasing tax revenue is also not according to the pre-war standard, which will be slightly lower than the pre-war standard, but the luxury tax should be increased more. (3) The treatment of civil servants is not up to the pre-war standard because of the current financial difficulties, so a discount is given, but it will be improved when the national finances improve. After this reform, it is actually higher than the past legal currency era. There is absolutely no restriction on the circulation of subsidiary currency. A foreign reporter asked whether the government was going to borrow money from the United States after the currency reform. Wang laughed and said: "This is our hope. In the beginning, we certainly hope to rely on self-reliance, but when necessary, we also hope for the assistance of friendly countries." Wang also said in a firm tone: "This currency reform must be implemented to the end. Anyone who destroys this plan will be severely punished."</p>
<h3>The Gold Yuan Certificate Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee: Nine Members Have Been Appointed, Organization Regulations Formulated and Promulgated by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] In order to consolidate the credit of the gold yuan certificate, the Executive Yuan has formulated and promulgated the organization regulations of the Gold Yuan Certificate Issuance Supervisory Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The Gold Yuan Certificate Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee is about to be established. A total of nine members have been appointed, including four government representatives: Vice Minister of Finance Li Tang, Deputy Director-General of the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics Pang Songzhou, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, and Vice Minister of the Audit Department Cai Pingfan. The five representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors and various industries are Xu Jiyu, Wang Xiaolai, Li Ming, Qin Runqing, and Xi Yushu.</p>
<h3>Economic Control Committee Established Within the Executive Yuan, Sending Senior Officials to be Permanently Stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] In order to strengthen price control, crack down on speculation and hoarding, regulate the supply of materials, and save consumption, so as to effectively implement the emergency measures for finance and economy, the Executive Yuan has established an Economic Control Committee within the Executive Yuan, responsible for planning and supervising matters related to stabilizing the economy, and has appointed senior economic control supervisors to be permanently stationed in the three regions of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou to supervise and guide, in order to implement and achieve results.</p>
<h3>Prices Under the New Currency System Will Definitely Be Stable, Balancing the Budget is Guaranteed, Only Hope That the Whole Country Will Abide by the Regulations</h3>
<p>President Yu's Reception of Reporters</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After President Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning, he hosted reporters at the Central Bank at 11 o'clock, emphasizing that currency reform is a necessary measure to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. The full text of his report is as follows:</p>
<p>"We all know that rising prices and the inability to balance the budget are mutually cause and effect; if we want to wait until the budget is balanced before reforming the currency system, we will inevitably be affected by this cycle and not know when to delay it. All financial and economic measures depend on the stability of the currency value, so the government resolutely made the greatest determination to reform the currency system, using the stability of prices under the new currency system to help balance the budget. Approaching budget balance can achieve long-term stability, so this emergency decree takes currency reform and financial reorganization as the central measures, supplemented by a plan to stabilize prices by controlling the economy. The handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency, and the registration and management of foreign exchange assets can eliminate an important factor disrupting domestic finance and prices on the one hand, and can also fully utilize these assets to help domestic production and construction. The difference between this emergency decree and previous reform plans is that it starts from the most basic aspects, which shows that the government has made the greatest determination and is determined to succeed. From Minister Wang's talk, we can see that the government not only has the determination to balance the budget, but also has a way to balance the budget. After the currency reform, the national finances can definitely be greatly improved, but the measures in each clause are interconnected and fully coordinated. Many aspects require the cooperation of people from all walks of life and the industrial and financial sectors. It is hoped that the whole country will abide by the various regulations to achieve the goals of stabilizing the economy, increasing production, and developing trade."</p>
<p>New Currency to Be Generally Issued Nationwide Starting Monday</p>
<p>Yu then answered reporters' questions, saying: "The gold yuan certificate will be officially issued starting today, but because the silver and money industry will be temporarily closed on the 20th and 21st, and the 22nd is Sunday, the new currency will actually begin to circulate on Monday (the 23rd). Starting from the 15th of this month, the National Bank has secretly transported various gold yuan certificates to branches all over the country." Yu also showed samples of various gold yuan certificates, including five denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan, all of which were printed by the American Bank Note Company in 1945 (34th year of the Republic). The certificates of yuan and below, such as jiao and fen, were printed by the De La Rue Printing Company in 1946 (35th year of the Republic). The printing year of the new currency shows that the government had already started currency reform work after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. (Copperplate illustration of gold yuan certificate published on page six)</p>
<p>Regarding how to thoroughly implement the various measures in the emergency measures for finance and economy, Yu revealed that Jiang Jingguo had visited him in the morning of the 20th to discuss this matter. He has decided to convene a meeting on the 21st with Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Deputy Speaker Xu, and Director Lin Chongyong to conduct specific research on this.</p>
<p>Hoping that Bank Interest Rates Will Return to Pre-War Standards</p>
<p>Yu also answered the following questions: (1) The gold yuan certificate is a type of managed gold standard. (2) There are clear regulations for the sale of gold ornaments in silver shops, but gold blocks must not be melted into ornaments. (3) The government should gradually reduce bank interest rates, hoping to return to pre-war standards. (4) The exchange rate will never change after the issuance of the new currency. (5) The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will be abolished, but the Gold Management Bureau and the Export Management Committee still need to exist.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Various Places to Instruct on Issuance Techniques</p>
<p>[Another Report] President Yu convened a meeting of responsible persons from various bureaus and departments of the bank at 12 noon on the 20th to discuss various technical issues related to the implementation of currency reform. Yu gave detailed instructions and listened to reports. For example, how to transfer accounts and estimate the needs of the market were decided on the spot. In addition, in order to clarify the implementation techniques for the important branches in other locations, it was decided to send Ji Chaoding (Xi'an), Gao Fang (Tianjin), Wang Chui (Northeast), Lin Weiying (Guangzhou), and Fang Shangui (Hankou) to the branches immediately to provide guidance. It is also learned that Yang Xiaobo, manager of the Chongqing branch, and Wu Benjing, manager of the Xiamen branch, who are staying in Shanghai on official business, will also depart on the same day. The meeting did not end until 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Minting of Subsidiary Currency: Shanghai Mint to Be Restored</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] For the minting of subsidiary currency, the Ministry of Finance will restore the Shanghai Mint to take charge. It will be divided into three types: (1) Silver coins, divided into one yuan and five jiao; (2) Nickel coins, divided into two jiao, one jiao, and five fen; (3) Copper coins, only one fen. Most of the above three types of subsidiary currency, silver coins and nickel coins, were originally stored in Chongqing, Guiyang, and Chengdu and have been transported to Beijing and Shanghai. Copper coins must be newly minted.</p>
<h3>Lou Tongsun Talks About Currency Reform: Deficits Should Be Publicly Disclosed in the Future, Hoping that Citizens Will Exchange Gold Notes on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Economist Lou Tongsun said: The measures adopted in this currency reform prove that the authorities have the courage to face reality and seek to clarify the current chaotic currency situation. The ratio of the gold yuan certificate to legal currency, gold, silver, and US dollars specified in the plan adopts a ratio close to the facts, and this ratio is quite close to the ratio when the legal currency was implemented before the war. Such reforms will minimize the market changes that may occur domestically and abroad due to currency reform. In particular, the public issuance, the establishment of a supervisory agency, and the stipulation of the maximum amount of issuance are a major progress and what I have advocated for many years. I am deeply gratified that this can be implemented, but there are also some regrets. The spirit of currency reform adopted by Romania in August last year and the Soviet Union in December last year was not used when legal currency, gold, silver, and foreign currency were exchanged for gold yuan certificates, with the good intention of adjusting the purchasing power of various levels during currency reform. As for the balance of the national budget mentioned in this measure, according to the precedents of advanced countries, to seek the true balance of the national budget, the statutory relationship between the national treasury and the issuing agency should be determined, and deficits should be fully disclosed in the future, which can both supervise the issuance and arouse the nation's attention to national finances. Regarding the gold, silver, and foreign currency stored by the people, Lou hopes that citizens will demonstrate a high degree of patriotism, abide by the measures promulgated by the government, and exchange them on schedule. Lou also hopes that the government will study stronger measures for the management of the silver industry. Regarding the declaration and registration of assets of Chinese citizens abroad, Lou also hopes that it can be earnestly implemented. Finally, Lou also believes that strengthening the control of financial institutions in the plan is particularly important, expresses special support, and advocates that the government should have greater determination and gradually implement it.</p>
<h3>Prices Converted to Gold Yuan Certificates: All Based on August 19th, Severe Punishment for Dishonest Merchants Who Raise Prices Privately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The government regards this emergency measure for finance and economy as the key to stabilizing the national economy and implementing the suppression of the rebellion, 當此實旋伊始, it is difficult to guarantee that a few people do not understand the meaning and effect of currency reform, or that there are dishonest merchants who disregard the overall situation and raise prices privately, disrupting the market. After the Executive Yuan approved the cases at the cabinet meeting last night and submitted them to the President for promulgation, it immediately issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments across the country, stating that according to the provisions of the measures for strengthening economic control, the gold yuan certificate prices of local goods and services should all be based on the local prices on August 19th of this year as the highest conversion standard, and no further increases are allowed. Thereafter, prices should be handled in accordance with the regulations on cracking down on violations of price limits and negotiated prices, and violators will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Flies to Tokyo Today, Stays for Two Weeks Before Going to South Korea, MacArthur Hosts a Reception for Zhang Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>

<h3>The Plan is Generally Satisfactory, But There Are Still Some Regrets</h3>
<p>Jian Guansan Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] A reporter consulted Legislative Yuan member Jian Guansan on the currency reform and received the following answer: "The major purpose of currency reform and economic measures is to combat the inflation and exploitation of a small number of people and to maintain the stable living of the majority of people. The plan announced this time is generally satisfactory, but there are also some regrets. Briefly speaking, they can be summarized as the following points: (1) The difference in the exchange rate between the new and old currencies was not stipulated according to the huge economic differences between ordinary people and wealthy households; (2) A large amount of floating capital was not frozen, but unlimited exchange of old currency for new currency was allowed; (3) The ratio of gold to US dollars is significantly higher, while the ratio of silver dollars is stipulated to be slightly lower; (4) The foreign exchange assets of the wealthy abroad were not frozen; (5) The base for the salaries of soldiers and public school staff is stipulated too low. It is hoped that the authorities can remedy the above items to comfort public opinion. As for the nationalization of gold, which has been my advocacy for many years, I am quite gratified that it has now been realized."</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Goes to Washington, Will Meet with the US Secretary of the Treasury</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] Chen Lifu, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, is scheduled to leave here tonight for Washington, where he will meet with the US Secretary of the Treasury tomorrow afternoon, and then go to the Moral Re-Armament Conference in Truto to deliver a speech.</p>
<h3>Wang Lingji Summoned by the President, Will Fly to the Capital for Duty in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch on the 20th] Wang Lingji was summoned by President Chiang Kai-shek on the 20th and will fly to Beijing in the coming days for duty. He will also consult with the Central District on issues such as Sichuan defense, construction, and conscription, and will discuss and decide on the annual Sichuan requisition and allocation quota, which is currently in dispute between the Sichuan Provincial Assembly and the Ministry of Food.</p>
<h3>Saving Changchun, Preparing a Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 20th] The specific plan for saving Changchun has been formulated by the local authorities and transferred to the central government for adoption. It is learned that the central government's position on Changchun is extremely firm, and it is extremely concerned about the food of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<h3>My Currency Stabilization Measures Welcomed by Wall Street; International Monetary Fund Has Been Notified by Us</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] The Chinese government's issuance of new currency has greatly surprised the Wall Street banking and trade circles here, which are usually extremely well-informed. They are taking a very cautious attitude toward this. Many people interviewed by reporters said that any measures taken by the Chinese government to stabilize the currency would be welcome. However, they raised many questions about the currency reform and pointed out that they could not comment on it until they had read the full text of the currency reform plan. Trade circles believe that a Chinese new currency with a stable value will help Sino-US trade, but they have not learned whether the Chinese government will remove trade restrictions in addition to currency reform to make Sino-US trade smoother. When reporters asked Wall Street figures whether China's exchange rate of four gold yuan to one US dollar needed to be approved by the International Monetary Fund, a banker replied that China is not currently a designated member of the Fund, so it is free to set the exchange rate between the new currency and the US dollar. However, once China becomes a designated member, it must obtain the Fund's permission before it can easily devalue or revalue its currency. The news of China's currency reform reached here this morning and immediately became the topic of conversation among people concerned about China. American banks with large deposits from Chinese people are eager to learn whether the Chinese government's regulations on redeeming US dollars held by the people also apply to the deposits of Chinese people here. If so, how will it be implemented? The general impression here is that the situation regarding China's issuance of new currency will not be clear until at least a week later.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] A Central News Agency reporter learned today that the International Monetary Fund has received formal notification from the Chinese government informing it of China's currency reform and the establishment of the Chinese "gold yuan." It is heard that the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund met this afternoon to discuss the report on China's currency reform. The Fund has no issue of recognizing or taking any action on China's new currency system. Therefore, no formal statement was issued after the meeting to explain the Fund's position. An official of the Fund emphasized that China's actions do not need to be approved or rejected by the International Monetary Fund. Although China was not required to notify the Fund in advance of the steps it intends to take, this expression now is sufficient to prove the close cooperation between China and the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Eliminating the Source of Chaos Should Be the Priority for Stabilizing Order</h3>
<p>Recently, labor unrest and student unrest have occurred one after another, with a great momentum of "one wave not yet subsided, another wave rises again," causing social order to be chaotic and people's minds to be turbulent and uneasy. For the people, there is no possibility of "living and working in peace and contentment." Everyone is longing for the country to turn chaos into stability. For the country, whether social order is stable or not is a symbol of the country's governance, and it must not be allowed to evolve naturally.</p>
<p>However, according to reports from various sources, the communist bandits are increasingly intensifying their disturbances, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, and secretly planting spies in various places in our rear areas to engage in "underground work" in an attempt to open up their so-called "second front" to echo the bandit troops on the front lines. The means they have adopted, in addition to instigating labor unrest and other behaviors that are sufficient to hinder production, also use vocational students in various schools to promote bandit propaganda verbally and in writing, spread rumors, shake people's hearts, and prepare for large-scale movements such as strikes, marches, and petitions in the future. Currently, although the schools are still in summer vacation, they are still occupied by vocational students, who regard the schools as "concessions" and openly engage in various anti-government activities. All those who are familiar with the inside information of the education circles believe that once the autumn semester begins, a large-scale student unrest will break out, which will inevitably have a serious impact on social order. This prediction is by no means an alarmist statement, but has a reliable basis. For the sake of preventing problems before they occur, the government authorities have issued a general order from the Executive Yuan to the local administrative and security agencies to make proper preparations and promulgated four major matters that should be paid attention to in the rear areas during the period of suppressing the rebellion. Whether it is for the sake of stabilizing people's livelihood and social order, or for the sake of safeguarding the lifeline of the country, the Executive Yuan's adoption of this measure is worthy of unanimous support from the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The current situation in our country is that, on the one hand, the communist bandits are launching a rebellion and attempting to seize power by force; while on the other hand, the government has long mobilized to suppress the rebellion, hoping to quell the bandits in the shortest possible time. The war on the front lines is raging fiercely on both sides. How can the government allow the communist spies to engage in "underground work" in the rear areas? However, if the government wants to eliminate bandit spies and stabilize the order in the rear areas, it will inevitably have to take measures that harm the basic rights of the people, which does not seem to be what a constitutional government should do. Therefore, although suppressing the rebellion and building the country has already been the current national policy, the government cannot avoid having the concern of "throwing a stone at the rat for fear of breaking the vase," and is unwilling to let go and do it, resulting in tolerating evil and creating the current situation where bandit spies run rampant in the rear areas. Some people in society are full of the idea that constitutionalism and suppressing the rebellion cannot coexist without contradicting each other. In the past, the government authorities also committed this kind of mistaken view and never had the spirit of "a brave man cutting off his wrist." However, as of today, communist spies have become even more rampant and unscrupulous under the cover of constitutional government. The government is indeed in a predicament, and has only taken emergency measures to eliminate bandit spies in the rear areas. All kind and patriotic people will certainly be able to endure the pain for a while.</p>
<p>The democratization of politics is the only way out for the Republic of China. Only by implementing the Three Principles of the People and implementing constitutional democracy can China become a strong, unified, peaceful, and democratic new China. Therefore, we have sincerely expressed our support for the political consultation conference after the victory to strive for political democratization and the nationalization of the army, as well as the later government's convening of the National Assembly to formulate a democratic constitution, and then to organize a democratic new government in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. However, looking back at the Communist Party, it is launching a rebellion, disregarding the lifeline of the country and the nation, and disregarding the lives and deaths of the people. In order to seize power, it will stop at nothing. In order to achieve its goals, even if it means the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race, it will not hesitate at all. Except for the insane who are willing to be communist spies, most kind ordinary people regard the communist bandits as the public enemy of the people. In particular, students who have clear minds and correct thoughts deeply know that if the bandit rebellion is not quelled for a day, the people's lives cannot be stable for a day. Recalling the people's lives since the victory, it is like "the water is getting deeper and the fire is getting hotter." If the people do not want to pay a heavy price and temporarily sacrifice their basic personal rights, then they cannot escape the water and fire and ascend to a comfortable seat. The government's measures, on the surface, seem to harm the people's rights, but in reality, the government's measures are to stabilize social order so that the people in the rear areas can live and work in peace and contentment, just like a doctor performing surgery on a patient. Enduring the pain for a while can turn danger into safety.</p>
<p>However, we also want to say a few words to the government. In recent years, the frequent occurrence of student unrest and labor unrest in various places, in addition to the manipulation and instigation of bandit spies, also has other objective factors, which is by no means accidental. The so-called "things must rot before worms are born." If there is absolutely no problem in the society itself, even if bandit spies have superior methods, they cannot create waves out of nothing, let alone add fuel to the fire. Therefore, we hope that the administrative and security agencies in various places, in addition to earnestly implementing the measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan, should also address the root causes, prevent all sources of chaos, and ensure that bandit spies have no opportunity to take advantage of.</p>
<h3>People Place Eager Hopes on the New Currency System; Positive Responses Nationwide; Price Fluctuations Are Only Temporary Phenomena</h3>
<p>Capital</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The government's swift and decisive measures to reform the currency system have been valued by the citizens. The sales of newspapers have increased sharply. The two batches of newspapers flown and transported by train to Nanjing were quickly snapped up. Currency reform has become a topic of conversation, and can be heard everywhere, but people's hearts are calm and there is no fear. Salaried people calculate the amount of their income based on the exchange rate. Low-level civil servants are quite satisfied. Employees of state-owned enterprises are slightly uneasy. Those who rely on wages for a living are taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that the government and employers can formulate reasonable measures. On the 20th, the Nanjing market was calm and tranquil all day long. Transactions were light. The prices of various goods mostly remained unchanged, and no one changed to using the new currency for pricing. Silver shops continued to operate as usual. Except for bar silver, which was unavailable, decorated gold was still sold for 595 million and bought for 545 million per tael. There were a large number of customers asking for prices. The silver dollar market was desolate. Since early morning, silver dollar dealers have been making their final struggles, initially shouting out 65,000, then buying in at 64,000, but only offering, not buying. Later, it fell to 56,000 for selling and 54,000 for buying, only selling, not buying. By the evening, it went up again, but very few transactions were made. Silver dollar dealers reversed their usual momentum and were all dejected. The source of rice was smooth and abundant. The Wuyang Market was noisy, but most were spectators. The market price did not fluctuate. All banks and credit cooperatives in the city have been ordered to close. Some agency employees who were originally scheduled to receive their salaries on the 20th were greatly disappointed. The value of the legal tender is expected to increase. Shops are eager to sell goods, and the prices of all things have a downward trend.</p>
<p>Hankou</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 20th] When the news of the currency reform came, the people here were very excited. Today, hard currency fell back, and cotton yarn and rice remained stable. Public and educational personnel especially congratulated each other.</p>
<p>Changsha</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Changsha, 20th] The citizens of Changsha learned about the news of the currency reform after reading the newspaper on the morning of the 20th. Here, silver dollars were only worth 4.8 million legal tender on the 19th. Because the regulations on the issuance of gold yuan notes stipulated that each silver dollar was equivalent to 2 yuan in gold notes, the value of silver dollars was 6 million legal tender. Therefore, the value of silver dollars rose sharply. Price fluctuations in Hunan depended on the rise and fall of silver dollars. As a result, the prices of various goods rose by more than one-third, and the situation was very chaotic. Until noon, all shops refused to sell goods, and the market was virtually at a standstill. All banks were closed on the 20th in compliance with orders, and all twenty or so money shops in the city also stopped trading.</p>
<p>Guangzhou</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] After the news of the currency reform was released, there was a brief commotion in the market.

<h3>Fu Sinian on the Overall Situation at Home and Abroad: The Time for a US-Soviet War Is Not Yet Ripe</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The well-known political commentator Fu Mengzhen (Sinian) arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 20th. When reporters visited him, Mr. Fu, looking tired from his journey, briefly discussed the ever-changing domestic and international situation of the past year, but rarely expressed his opinions. Because Mr. Fu was in the United States for medical treatment and did not see Chinese newspapers, he was aware of but not familiar with the domestic situation. He avoided commenting on matters such as the election of the president and vice president, and the Legislative Yuan's enthusiastic desire to elect Mr. Fu as the vice president. When reporters asked him whether he would meet the president or whether he would be willing to take any position in the Legislative Yuan, he answered "no" to all, and said that due to his health, he needed to rest for half a day every day, so he could not take on heavy responsibilities. He also specifically stated that he had never made such preparations. The reporter then asked for his views on the inevitable war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Mr. Fu said that under this contradictory and delicate relationship, a war would inevitably occur in the future, but certain issues, such as the US's inability to deploy 200,000 troops abroad for combat, and the Soviet Union's navy, would not allow the war to break out before the end of this year or within the next year. Mr. Fu also said that the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the Soviet Union, wanted to seize the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, which was like a grandfather waiting for the birth of his grandson, quite difficult. When the reporter asked about the American attitude towards Feng Yuxiang, Mr. Fu said that the Americans would politely ask him to leave because he was involved with the Communist Party, which was unacceptable to the United States. Finally, when the reporter asked for his opinions on student activists and currency reform, Mr. Fu did not comment.</p>
<h3>Disaster in Various Embankments Around Xiangbin Lake, Accounting for Half of All Lake Fields; Relief Funds Have Not Yet Reached the Hands of the Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 20th] According to reports received by the provincial government from various counties regarding the disaster situation around Xiangbin Lake, out of a total of 661 embankments, 306 embankments collapsed, accounting for nearly half of all lake fields. Among them, Feng County suffered the most embankment collapses, with only one embankment remaining out of the county's 63 embankments, and even that was flooded, resulting in a 100% disaster rate. In other counties such as Nan County, Yuanjiang, and Anxiang, many embankments also collapsed, and all the uncollapsed embankments were also flooded, also resulting in a 100% disaster rate. In Hanshou, Huarong, Changde, Yueyang, Linxiang, Xiangyin, and Yiyang, some reclaimed land was not affected by the floods, so the disaster rate was only considered 90%. Farmers in the disaster area are gathered together, making a living by selling their family property. As a result, the prices of pork, chicken, and beef are particularly cheap. Currently, pork is selling for 480,000 per catty, which is three-quarters cheaper than the price in Changsha. Those who cannot make a living are leading the old and carrying the young to beg for food in other places. The central government's 40 billion emergency relief fund, after distribution, amounted to a maximum of 600,000 for a large family and 300,000 for a small family. The disaster victims in Yuanjiang only received 150,000, which is not enough to buy half a liter of rice. Moreover, even this small amount has not yet reached the hands of the disaster victims after passing through the province, county, and township levels.</p>

<h3>Internal Friction Increasing in Tibet; Rongzeng Seals Up Serası Monastery's Estates</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 20th] Our reporter has just received a telegram from Tibet dated the 19th: Internal friction in Tibet is increasing. Some noble families are fighting over the estates of Serası Monastery in Rear Tibet as spoils of war. Regent Rongzeng Dagzhag, in order to appease the united front of exiled monks from Serası Monastery and monks from Drepung Monastery, has sealed up all the properties of the noble families who previously seized the estates of Serası Monastery. Note: Serası Monastery is the monastery where the former Regent Reting studied, and it has been shelled by the current Regent Rongzeng Dagzhag. In addition, last year, monks from the Qingpa sect of Drepung Monastery went to Xining to trade.

<h3>Envoys from Three Nations Receive New Instructions; To Meet Again with Soviet Foreign Minister; Sokolovsky Returns to Berlin</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 20th Radio Moscow Dispatch: Envoys from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have received new instructions from their respective governments, hoping to hold a sixth meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 20th] The special envoys of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France held a series of meetings on the 20th, due to which, it seems there is some basis to believe that the three envoys may meet with Molotov before this evening. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith met with British Special Envoy Roberts at the US Embassy at 10:45 this morning. Also present were US Minister Coulan and British diplomatic counselor Harrison. After discussing for 90 minutes, Smith and Roberts drove to the French Embassy at 12:15 to meet with French Ambassador Chattay. The three ambassadors held a meeting for half an hour, after which Smith and Roberts returned to the US Embassy for another meeting. The reason for the postponement of the meeting between the ambassadors of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom with Molotov may be due to the difficulty in obtaining replies from the governments of the three countries. Reliable sources believe that the content of this meeting may be announced, unless the three envoys believe that further meetings are necessary.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 19th] An American spokesperson here stated today with reserved confidence that at the next meeting of Western envoys with Molotov, an east-west agreement on Germany is expected to be established. The spokesperson said, "I am optimistic. However, we have now discussed it to its core, so it is difficult to say for sure until the last minute."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The Times of London's Berlin correspondent wrote in the newspaper, citing Soviet sources, that Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, has returned to Berlin, carrying the Soviet government's correct instructions regarding the exclusion of Western powers from the German capital. The correspondent continued, "If the Moscow consultations cannot reach a final agreement, it is expected that the Soviet Union will gradually use pressure to make the Berlin blockade 100% effective, and this is already showing signs. The correspondent concluded that, judging from the Moscow talks and everything that has happened in Berlin, it shows that the Soviet Union is trying to gain complete control of Berlin whenever possible. In fact, within a week, the Soviet Union has tried twice to cross the border of its Berlin zone to control the police power in the Western zone. Regardless of the true intention of their pursuit of black market merchants, this matter has hinted that the Soviet Union's policy of seizing the rights of Western powers is increasing day by day.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] Officials from the US Public Safety Bureau stated that at least five German police officers from the US zone of Berlin were kidnapped by Soviet troops at the border between the US and Soviet western zones, including the chief of the police station in the area, Hoppe. Three of the five have escaped and returned to the US zone. They were captured by Soviet troops in the Kreuzberg district on the morning of the 20th when German police in the Soviet zone shot at black market traders. However, according to later reports from the German police station, a total of six police personnel were missing, three of whom had escaped. Hoppe and the other two were taken to the Soviet zone.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] It is reported that Campoja, the Berlin coal allocation director, was kidnapped by German police in the Soviet zone at his municipal government office.

<h3>Account of the Clash at the Border Between the British and Soviet Zones</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 19th] A gunfight occurred between German police at the Potsdam Square intersection of the British and Soviet occupation zones in Berlin at around 6:00 pm on the 19th, resulting in the deaths of at least four German civilians. According to British sources, during a search for black marketeers by Soviet-occupied police in the square, they chased them into the adjacent British-occupied zone. It is said that they fired shots. The German police in the British zone, who had been watching the search, immediately returned fire. An angry crowd of about 4,000 people rushed into the square when the two sides opened fire and began throwing bricks at the police on both sides. They then poured into the Soviet zone, tore down the party flags of the Socialist Unity Party (Communist Party) district branch and the Soviet flag, and burned them.

<h3>Soviet Union Owes US Debt; Interest Payment Not in Full</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] US officials recently announced that the interest payment made by the Soviet Union on its US debt is not acceptable to the United States, and the Soviet Union has been asked to make up the remainder. The Soviet Union owes the United States a total of $225 million. The United States issued an invoice to the Soviet Union on July 1, demanding $5 million in interest. Six weeks later, the Soviet Union sent a check for more than $3.34 million. The Soviet debt is based on the price of equipment shipped to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act before the victory over Japan. The original contract stipulated that the United States should ship $250 million worth of goods to the Soviet Union, but Congress later ordered the shipments to stop. The Soviet Union claimed that some of the shipped goods were useless and that the debt should be "adjusted."</p>

<h3>United Nations Decides to Establish a Flood Control Bureau in Asia</h3>
<p>Economic and Social Council Passes Our Proposal</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 19th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council passed a Chinese proposal on the 19th, deciding to establish a United Nations Flood Control Bureau in Asia and the Far East. The United States opposed it, saying that the bureau infringed on the powers of the United Nations Secretary-General. Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun argued reasonably and won the victory. US representative Thorpe advocated establishing a "technical team directly under the Secretary's Office, staffed by flood control experts." As for the Flood Control Bureau, it should be studied by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and a report should be submitted to the next meeting of the Economic and Social Council. The Soviet Union and other eleven countries unanimously supported the Chinese proposal, while the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand, and Canada voted against it. Zhang Pengchun denied that the Flood Control Bureau would interfere with the powers of the Secretariat, and also said that the US fear that the bureau would become "semi-dominant" was unfounded. "We cannot delay any longer, millions of people are waiting for our decision."</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Condemns US for Abducting Soviet Teachers; US Rejects Soviet Protest; Formally Submits Note Demanding Recall of Soviet Consul</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The United States demanded on the 20th that the Soviet Union recall Consul General Lomakin because he took "extremely inappropriate" actions in the case of the three Soviet teachers. The note condemned Lomakin for refusing to allow New York police officers to meet with Mrs. Kasenkina to obstruct police investigations, and for forcing Mrs. Gao to make a false statement that she was willing to return to her country. The note stated: "The United States Government believes that Consul General Lomakin's actions abused the privileges of his position and violated generally accepted standards regarding the actions of diplomatic officials."</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Mrs. Kasenkina and the Saumarins, the US note stated: "According to the investigation report of the appropriate American authorities, not only does it show that the Soviet Union's condemnation of 'abduction' is completely unfounded, but it also shows that officials of the Soviet Government participated in extremely inappropriate actions." The note continued: "The United States 'must unconditionally reject all condemnations and insinuations in the Soviet note, because they are completely inconsistent with the facts.'" The note was signed by Deputy Secretary of State Lovett and delivered to the Soviet Embassy on the evening of the 19th. This is the first diplomatic offensive launched by the US government in the case.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The State Department will explain on the 20th the reasons for rejecting the Soviet Union's various accusations and demands regarding the case of the three Soviet teachers. The government sent a note rejecting the Soviet protest to the Soviet Embassy on the evening of the 19th. This is the first diplomatic offensive launched by the government in the case of Mrs. Kasenkina and the Saumarins. The content of the note will be released at 10 pm, which is equivalent to 11 am Shanghai time. State Department Press Officer McDermott said that the note only answers three of the Soviet Union's four protests. He said that the fourth point of the Soviet protest, regarding the issuance of a subpoena to Lomakin, does not actually require an answer.</p>

Officials declined to comment on this. However, officials admitted that the Burmese government had requested British assistance in dealing with the rebellion. The British side has made it clear that they cannot assist Burma militarily, as Burma has become an independent country through universal suffrage. The only thing Britain can do is send troops to Burma to protect British citizens and property, which must be considered.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Yangon, 20th] As Burmese government forces are intensifying their attacks on the besieged rebels in the suburbs of Yangon, communist propagandists distributed leaflets on the streets of the city on the 20th, warning people that Yangon will soon be occupied by communist troops.

<h3>Publication of Hopkins' Memoirs Reveals Roosevelt Violated My Wishes at the Tehran Conference and Agreed to the Soviet Use of Dalian Port</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] Hopkins' memoirs were published today, revealing that President Roosevelt first indicated to Stalin at the Tehran Conference that the Soviet Union could obtain Dalian after the war to meet the Soviet Union's need for an ice-free port.</p>
<p>The famous playwright Sherwood further clarified that this was Roosevelt's first statement on the matter, made in Tehran, not Yalta. (According to general rumors, Roosevelt was so weak at the time that he did not realize the importance of what he was doing.) Stalin immediately expressed the opinion that this suggestion would be opposed by China, but Roosevelt said that he believed they could agree to make Dalian a free port. Sherwood stated, "From my personal understanding, Roosevelt was not merely speculating - in fact, Roosevelt had discussed this issue with President Chiang in Cairo a few days prior."</p>
<p>Afterwards, Hopkins informed Stalin, Churchill, Eden, and Molotov that post-war Pacific bases for the Allies would not be difficult to arrange. Hopkins stated, "We, the American people, do not want to acquire sovereignty over any island liberated from Japan. The United Nations may adopt protective measures for them. As for the Philippines after achieving independence, we still believe that there should be American naval and air bases without the control of the United Nations."</p>
<p>Sherwood stated that a few days later, at the Cairo Conference with Roosevelt, Churchill, and the chiefs of staff of both countries, "Roosevelt felt he should fulfill his promise to President Chiang. Ten days prior, Roosevelt had promised to launch two vigorous campaigns in the Southeast Asian theater, because Stalin's sudden declaration in Tehran that the Soviet Union was willing to join the war against Japan had changed the entire war situation.</p>
<p>Sherwood stated: During the Tehran Conference, Roosevelt told Stalin that his planned post-war United Nations would include: First, a world assembly to discuss world problems. Second, an executive committee, including China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and several small countries, to handle non-military issues. Third, an organization of "international police," including China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which would have the authority to immediately deal with any event threatening peace. Stalin believed that the suggestion of a four-nation police force would not be willingly accepted by the smaller European countries, because he did not believe that China would be very strong after the end of the war, and even if China became stronger, European countries would not want China to be a coercive power over them. Therefore, he proposed a compromise solution, suggesting that a committee be established in both Europe and the Far East. Roosevelt said that although he was very clear about China's current weakness, he insisted that China must participate in the Moscow Four-Power Declaration, because he was planning for the future and believed that China's 400 million people were friends and not potential enemies."</p>
<h3>The Struggle Between Stalin and Tito (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated by this newspaper's editorial office</p>
<p>(Original article published in the July 9th issue of "U.S. News &amp; World Report" magazine)</p>
<p>Then Tito launched a counterattack, rejecting the Soviet accusations in a strongly worded reply in April. He strenuously defended that his policies were best suited to the national conditions of Yugoslavia and did not contradict Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, to avoid giving ammunition to opponents, Tito ordered the immediate nationalization of small industries and retail businesses, and imposed a new grain tax on independent farmers, forcing marginal farmers to join cooperatives, a substitute for Yugoslav collective farms.</p>
<p>Yugoslav Leaders Unwilling to Yield</p>
<p>However, the opposition shifted its ground, defying these orders, arguing that Yugoslavia was not fully prepared, and that if forcibly implemented, the domestic distribution system would be disrupted. This time, Moscow supported the opposition.</p>
<p>What followed was the purge of opposition leaders. On May 6th, Zorgevic and Hebrand were simultaneously dismissed from their cabinet posts and detained. In early June, Zorgevic was further stripped of his lieutenant general rank. According to unconfirmed reports, Hebrand was secretly tried and executed in late June.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Belgrade received increasingly strongly worded letters from Moscow on May 4th and 22nd. After these two letters were rejected by Tito, the Cominform convened a meeting in Bucharest in late June to discuss the Soviet accusations against Tito.</p>
<p>Thus, Yugoslavia broke off relations with the Cominform. Tito refused to send a representative to the Bucharest meeting. The Cominform passed a resolution, affirming Moscow's accusations, blaming him for not accepting Soviet opinions, and encouraging "ideologically sound" Yugoslav communists to reform his policies, or else simply overthrow him and his leading party members and elect others to replace them.</p>
<p>The result was a counterattack. Marshal Tito was unwilling to yield, denying the Cominform's authority to issue orders to him. He defended the position of his communists, insisted on maintaining closer relations with the Soviet Union, and planned to appeal directly to Stalin to overturn the Cominform's resolution. However, he still rejected all of the Soviet Union's accusations against his government. The leaders of the Yugoslav government, including Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, united with the Prime Minister to resist Moscow.</p>
<p>The Consequences of the Soviet-Yugoslav Conflict</p>
<p>The result of this matter is: Western countries know that a crack has occurred within the Soviet bloc; satellite states know that it is possible to resist Moscow and break away from it; the Kremlin knows that it has mismanaged the situation and will endanger its greatest gain from World War II, namely the annexation of Eastern Europe to form the Soviet Union's security zone.</p>
<p>Now, both Moscow and Belgrade are in a dilemma, but the door to negotiations between the two sides has not yet closed. They insist that the dispute between the two sides is a dispute between communist parties, not a dispute between the Soviet and Yugoslav governments. Diplomatic relations between the two countries are still tenuous, and the Soviet-Yugoslav alliance remains in effect.</p>
<p>The United States currently has two courses of action to choose from: it can encourage Tito to continue to part ways with Moscow through loans and trade, or sacrifice Yugoslavia's interests and make a deal with the Soviet Union, because Yugoslavia's demands, supported by the Soviet Union, have so far become the biggest obstacle to the Austrian peace treaty and the resolution of the Trieste issue.</p>
<p>However, the US authorities are acting with extreme caution and have not rushed to the conclusion that the split between Moscow and Belgrade is permanent. But throughout the West, no matter how much pressure the Soviet Union exerts on Berlin, the fear of war is gradually dissipating. People generally feel that the Soviet Union is already very busy in Eastern Europe and will have no time to exert pressure on other parts of Europe for some time to come.</p>

<h3>Mayor Calls Meeting of Various Industries Today to Discuss Coordination with the Currency Reform Policy; Prices of Daily Necessities Must Not Be Raised</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu, in order to coordinate with the currency reform policy, has scheduled a meeting with relevant industries in the city at 10:00 AM today. Invitees include the city's Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, Money Exchange Association, Rice Industry Association, Flour Industry Association, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Vegetable Industry Association, Department Store Association, Grain Industry Association, Global Goods Industry Association, Rice and Silk Industry Association, Xinle Industry Association, China Vegetable Oil Factory, Fresh Meat Industry Association, Pig Trade Association, and the current chairmen and standing directors of the Import and Export Medicine Association.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mayor Wu convened the responsible persons of the rice business, grain business, flour and noodle business, oil business, and North and South Rice Markets, including Zhang Xichao, Shan Wenjun, Yang Wenxiong, and Xu Songren, in the City Hall conference room at 11:00 AM yesterday morning for discussions. Mayor Wu inquired about whether there were any problems with the supply of retail outlets during the holiday period for businesses. Each representative reported that the retail business was in a normal state and that citizens would not suffer from having nowhere to buy goods. Mayor Wu also instructed the representatives of each industry that, starting next week, the prices of daily necessities for people's livelihood must not exceed the original prices of August 19th.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Speaks: Prices Can Definitely Be Stabilized</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The reporter visited Mayor Wu at his City Hall office at 5:00 PM yesterday to inquire about the measures taken by the municipal government to coordinate with the currency reform. According to him: After the announcement of the currency reform policy, the market situation today is still relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations in retail prices. The reason for this is likely the shortage of cash circulation after the closure of the businesses. Mayor Wu has already convened the responsible persons of various industries for discussions yesterday, instructing them to uniformly convert prices to gold yuan currency units according to the prices of August 19th when they reopen next Monday, and strictly prohibiting price increases during the opportunity. Then, prices will definitely stabilize starting next week.</p>
<h3>Restoring Pre-War Standards: Two Railways Discuss Fares</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau convened a temporary bureau affairs meeting yesterday to review the issue of passenger and freight fares after the currency reform. According to Article 3 of the "Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls," the fees for state-owned public utility and transportation enterprises that are lower than pre-war standards are allowed to be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency. If so, the fares of the two railways will generally increase by about one time, because the first-class ticket price from Beijing to Shanghai before the war was 11 yuan and 8 jiao, and the current ticket price converted to gold currency is only more than 6 yuan. The bureau is currently awaiting instructions from the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<h3>Public Utility Prices: Difficult to Meet Pre-War Standards</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau: After the currency reform, it is feared that the prices of public utilities will still be difficult to restore to pre-war original prices, because the prices of fuels used by public utilities have risen too much. For example, kerosene has risen six times compared to before the war, and diesel has also risen five times. It is also difficult to balance other metal indexes, so the prices of public utilities are difficult to approach pre-war levels.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Reducing Automobiles</h3>
<p>Regarding the Central Government's announcement today that one-quarter of automobile licenses will be cancelled in the future, relevant persons from the Public Utilities Bureau stated that it is very difficult to implement in Shanghai, because most of the automobiles in the city belong to the privileged class. If strict implementation is desired, it is inevitable to offend people, so it is expected that it will be difficult to implement.</p>
<h3>Military Police Ordered to Catch Speculators: Proceeding According to Drafted Blacklist</h3>
<p>It is reported that: The military medical authorities were ordered to convene a joint meeting at 7:00 PM on the 19th, deciding to launch actions related to prices today. According to the drafted blacklist, a large number of speculators will be arrested. This work of arresting speculators must be completed before Sunday of this week, in order to curb speculators from making waves when businesses reopen next Monday.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau divided into 20 groups at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, and went to the city's major markets to monitor and investigate general price reactions, and to severely crack down on stores that raise prices without reason and illegal silver dollar trading. The Gold Management Bureau also dispatched 15 inspection teams, two people per team, to various banks and money exchanges yesterday morning to monitor and prohibit any deposit and storage behavior.</p>
<h3>Yuegu Bonnie Nylon Stockings: Economic and Social Bureau Marks for Return</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The nylon stockings (i.e., glass stockings) seized by the Social Bureau in conjunction with the Police Bureau at the Dahua Department Store on Lin Sen Middle Road were certified by the Yuegu Bonnie Factory in the city as being manufactured by the factory, and the factory was registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs as a manufacturer in Shanghai. The director of the Textile Department of the Social Bureau went to the factory to investigate and confirmed that it was true. The nylon stockings seized yesterday were returned. However, the Social Bureau will pay attention to the following two items of the factory in the future: (1) Prevent the smuggling of imported goods, (2) The products manufactured by the factory should have a special trademark for identification.</p>
<h3>China Airlines Passenger Tickets: Method of Attaching Photos Canceled</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] China Airlines previously attached photos to passenger tickets sold by the company when purchasing tickets, and verified them upon boarding to prevent profiteering through black market resales after being purchased in bulk. It is now learned that: This method has been notified by the company to all stations across the country to be canceled from today. The reason is said to be that the general public believes that the procedure is too cumbersome and there are many complaints. The company had to announce the cancellation of this method, and passengers who purchase tickets will no longer need to attach photos.</p>
<h3>Printing Office Manager Jumps from Building: Five Workers Involved in Incident Dismissed, Three Each Receive One Major Demerit</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Workers at the Shanghai Kuiji Printing Office previously surrounded Zou Chengyi, the manager of the office, due to a dispute over the calculation of wage indexes. Zou was accustomed to this and jumped from the building to commit suicide. He was rescued but not killed, but suffered serious injuries. After the Social Bureau investigated this matter, it decided yesterday to dismiss the five workers involved in the incident at the office, including Wang Bingquan, Shen Jinrong, Chen Quancun, Zhao Qiquan, and Zhang Nianxin, and Shen Xueming, Mei Jinhai, and Wang Lisheng each received one major demerit.</p>
<h3>After Currency Reform: New Standard for Rent: Land Administration Bureau to Discuss Next Week: Likely Not Higher Than Pre-War</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the currency reform, regarding how to calculate the rent standard in the city, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday. According to him: After the announcement of the currency reform news, the Land Bureau is still considering the rent revision method. However, two situations may occur in the city, that is, the landlord requests to calculate the rent amount in gold yuan currency according to the pre-war rent amount, and the tenant requests to calculate the rent amount in gold yuan currency according to the current rent amount paid. If the former is followed, then the general public cannot afford it. If the latter is followed, then the rent can be as low as only worth a few jiao in gold yuan currency. Therefore, the determination of the new rent standard should be based on the income situation of the general public, so that the tenant can afford the rent, and at the same time the landlord's reasonable income must also be taken into account, so that they have the interest in investing in building new houses. However, in any case, the new rent amount should be lower than the pre-war rent amount.</p>
<p>The Land Administration Bureau will invite relevant parties in the city to hold a symposium next week to discuss the rent issue after the currency reform. After the principles are decided in the meeting, a method will be drafted and submitted to the municipal government for approval before implementation. Therefore, the rent for this month will still be calculated according to the current standard.</p>

After this incident occurred, the head of Qixia Mountain Station urgently telegraphed Nanjing and the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory for assistance. The Qishuyan Locomotive Factory urgently dispatched a 45-ton crane to the scene to rescue. At that time, the 54th passenger train of the 3rd and 4th class also arrived at Qixia Mountain. It immediately used the locomotive to drag all the carriages that had not derailed behind the 58th train back to Qixia Mountain at 11:40 AM. After the repairs, traffic was restored at 3:45 PM. Yesterday, due to the accident of the 58th train near Qixia Mountain, the 15th express train of the first, second and third class from Beijing to Shanghai (departing at 1:05 PM), the 86th passenger train of the second and third class from Zhenjiang to Beijing (departing at 1:00 PM), and the 87th intercity train of the second and third class from Beijing to Zhenjiang (departing at 12:15 PM) were all suspended.

He originally planned to decide and announce them within a few days, but now it will have to be redetermined. The method of converting school fees into food rice will be cancelled from now on. Director Li also said: The charging standard for the next semester will be based on the pre-war school fees as a principle.</p>
<p>The cost of living index for the second half of this month in the city will no longer be published in accordance with the government's order. Regarding the wage calculation method for each factory, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Bureau, went to Beijing yesterday to request a reasonable method from the government.</p>
<p>According to Zhao Banfu, deputy director of the Social Bureau, when he met with reporters yesterday morning, the Social Bureau has started to draft a method for calculating workers' wages after the currency reform. This method is expected to be announced around the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Land Appreciation Tax to Be Levied Starting September 1st</h3>

<h3>Songhu Garrison Command Vigorously Rectifies Military Discipline</h3>

<h3>Fell and Died in Cooling Off on Riverbank Iron Railing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the iron railing along the Suzhou River at the west end of the old garbage bridge on North Zhejiang Road, there were many people cooling off due to the hot weather. At about 9:00 PM last night, a person named Lu Changfa, 42 years old, residing at No. 7, Changkang Lane, Qufu Road, was cooling off on the iron railing with neighbors.

<h3>Inmates Call for Amnesty: Investigation Shows Communist Party Involvement: Strict Precautions Taken in Various Prisons of the District Court</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently found that inmates in prisons in Taicang, Changshu, Songjiang, Yuyao in Zhejiang, and Yibin in Sichuan even jointly printed and distributed documents calling for amnesty. After investigation, it was found that they were Communist Party traitors who, during the period of suppressing the rebellion, used the crime of committing ordinary crimes as a cover to illegally carry out activities in prison on the chance. The various prisons of the District Court in the city have also recently discovered the above situation. The court has strictly isolated them and taken proper precautions, and has carefully examined the daily words and deeds and correspondence of the detained prisoners and conducted serious inspections.</p>
<h3>Optimism Expressed by Various Circles in This City Regarding the New Fiscal Consolidation Measures; Hope for Sincere Implementation to Earn Public Trust</h3>
<p>Following the government's promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs and the implementation of currency reform, reactions from all quarters in this city have been extremely positive. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the reactions of leading figures from various sectors to these measures, specifically conducted interviews to solicit opinions, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Qiu Liangrong</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu Liangrong, Secretary-General of the China International Trade Association, stated: "Any economic activity can only be healthy under currency stability, and international trade is no exception. In the future, with stable currency values, stable prices, and lower market interest rates, domestic finance will be active, and imports and exports can be expected to have reasonable profits, no longer becoming speculative transactions as in the past. Only then can international trade be sound and develop upwards. While we are delighted, we deeply hope that the government will improve its import and export trade policies and ensure that all facilities are aimed at assisting exports and encouraging production. All institutions and procedures that do not meet these needs should be eliminated. At the same time, all gold, silver, foreign currencies, and foreign assets owned by the people must be transferred under the government's control according to law. The government will not worry about a lack of foreign exchange. I hope that national banks will only focus on how to use financial power to help people engage in profitable trade, and no longer directly participate in purchasing and selling businesses. For secondary export materials and materials that are difficult for merchants to operate, the government should assist merchants in various ways to promote trade, increase foreign exchange income, and benefit the stability of the currency system."</p>
<p>Wu Yun Chu</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Yun Chu, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, stated: "The Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs promulgated by the President on August 19, and the various methods formulated to deal with hoarding, speculation, and the rampant trading of gold and US dollars, are indeed a symptomatic remedy. The conversion rate of the legal tender is also appropriate. The resolute implementation is truly a major event worthy of special mention in our country's economic history. Based on the brief opinions I have at the moment, I believe that: (1) The current state of the country and society, chronic diseases are deep-rooted, and there are too many sources of disease. It seems unwise to expect a single dose of drastic medicine to cure chronic illnesses. (2) Since the government's plan has been announced and determined to be implemented, it must be implemented effectively and 100% to gain the trust of the general public. If trust is lost, it will repeat the mistakes of the legal tender. (3) There are still many minor details, such as: (A) The worker index in Shanghai has already exceeded three million. Abolishing the index may inevitably lead to disputes during implementation; (B) Living indexes vary in different regions, meaning the value of the legal tender also varies. The current uniform conversion at a rate of three million times should consider the ways of adjusting surpluses and deficits; (C) If loan interest rates are lowered, should the interest rates on short-term treasury bills also be lowered; (D) After this news spread last night, the prices of daily necessities and food in the vegetable markets have soared today. This may be a temporary phenomenon, but it is worth noting. There may be many other similar matters."</p>
<p>Zhu Si Huang</p>
<p>Professor Zhu Si Huang, Head of the Banking Department at Fudan University and Secretary of the Banking Association, stated: "The new currency used this time is called the Gold Yuan. However, how to maintain the value of this Gold Yuan in the long term, and how to fully implement the various measures stipulated in the measures for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic control, such as balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and saving consumption, are all prerequisites. This reform is completely different from the reform when managed currency was implemented in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). The reason why currency value could be stabilized at that time was that legal tender could buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. The true essence of a pseudo-gold standard lies in this. The fundamental foundation still lies in reducing consumption, increasing production, and establishing national credibility."</p>
<p>Song Binglun</p>
<p>Mr. Song Binglun, Executive Director of the Shanghai Import and Export Chamber of Commerce, stated: "(1) According to Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People, and Article 10, Paragraph 2 of the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets, gold, silver, and foreign currency are converted into US dollars at the exchange rate, and the funds deposited in the Central Bank can be used to pay for imported goods with import permits. This is equivalent to partially opening up self-provided foreign exchange. If import permits can be issued in coordination, the panic over important production equipment and industrial raw materials needed by factories in the future has been remedied. (2) The current difficulty in export trade is the low prices abroad. The authorities are currently seeking countermeasures. If there are remedial measures, coupled with the new situation after the currency reform, if prices can remain stable in the long term, export trade will naturally have a future."</p>
<p>Sun Churen</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Churen, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, stated: "The greatest advantage of currency reform is that everything conforms to the actual market situation, and there is no loss to the people. For example, 3 million legal tender is exchanged for 1 Gold Yuan, and 4 Gold Yuan is exchanged for 1 US dollar, while the market price of a US dollar is exactly 12 million legal tender. There is no gain or loss in mutual exchange. Also, 200 Gold Yuan is exchanged for each tael of gold, which is also in line with the market price of 600 million legal tender. As for the total issuance amount being limited to 2 billion yuan, and the powers of the 'Gold Yuan Currency Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee' being particularly expanded, such as monthly 'inspections,' 'reports,' and 'public announcements,' if these matters are handled particularly conscientiously, the future should be worry-free. What is hoped is that if the two ends of 'balancing the national budget' and 'balancing international payments' can be firmly grasped, then 'managing the economy' and 'stabilizing prices' can also be successfully completed."</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun</p>
<p>Mr. Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, stated: "The people of the whole country should unanimously support this currency reform. If prices can truly become stable in the future, workers will feel supreme welfare. If prices still fluctuate and the worker index has been frozen, they will feel uneasy."</p>
<h3>General Opinions of the Industrial Sector</h3>
<p>[Our News] The opinions of the industrial sector on currency reform can be summarized into the following points: (1) The government must control more quantities of materials for large-scale sales and supply to the market. Once prices are set, they should not be adjusted at any time. State-owned enterprise materials such as sugar from Taiwan Sugar Corporation, yarn from Textile Construction Corporation, oil from China Plantation Corporation, household rationed rice, and coal for industrial use should be supplied to the market at stable prices for a long time. Only then can the effect of suppressing and stabilizing prices be achieved. (2) Public transportation should maintain current prices. (3) Bank loan interest rates should also be reduced to the pre-war standard of 1.8% or 0.6%. (4) The difficulty felt by the industrial sector is that after converting funds into gold currency, it is necessary to readjust and increase capital again. In this way, dividend expenses will greatly increase. (5) If prices cannot be stabilized as desired after the cancellation of the living index, there will be endless troubles. It is hoped that the government will pay attention to this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Government Must Sell a Large Quantity of Materials; Bank Loan Interest Rates Should Be Reduced</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Parades and Petitions; The General Labor Union Notifies Its Subordinates After Receiving Orders</h3>
<p>During the sixth general meeting of the first session of the Municipal Council, elementary school teachers repeatedly petitioned the council and the Education Bureau. However, their representatives neither declared their identities nor were willing to sign according to regulations. Their actions clearly showed signs of disrupting order. If they were allowed to continue unchecked, it would not only hinder public security but also affect the suppression of the rebellion. After the council's resolution, and the determination of three measures, a letter was sent to the municipal government to strictly prohibit such actions in order to quell the source of the chaos. Yesterday, the Municipal General Labor Union received the above instructions and has notified all industry unions accordingly. The original three measures are recorded as follows: (1) Petitioning groups must strictly comply with central regulations, and their representatives must not exceed ten people. (2) Petitioning representatives must carry their national identity cards, professional certificates, and proof of the group they represent. (3) If there are any more mass petitions, the police局 should strictly stop them.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry to Discuss Adjustment of Freight Rates Today</h3>
<p>After the government announced the currency reform and measures to strengthen economic control and consolidate finances, all transportation agencies in this city expressed optimism about the future. All passenger and cargo ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are operating as usual. However, with banks closed, all departments feel a lack of cash. Fortunately, there is some income from passenger ticket sales, and passengers purchased tickets in advance, so ticket sales have not decreased due to the bank closures. According to the initial estimate of the company, the current prices of passenger and cargo transport are lower than the pre-war freight rates. Whether adjustments are needed and how to adjust them are currently being studied in detail. At the same time, they are awaiting instructions from the Ministry of Communications. The Shipowners Association and the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association are scheduled to hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 8:30 am on the 21st to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Zhang Renyou's Case of Being Reported for Falsely Reporting Oil Consumption</h3>

<h3>District Chief Jin Dehuan Not Prosecuted in Embezzlement Case</h3>

This was discovered by the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, which transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office. At the same time, residents Jin Shuqin and Zhang Yitang also filed lawsuits. After the court opened for investigation, the case has now been concluded. District Chief Jin Dehuan has been acquitted due to insufficient evidence. As for Wang and the other two, they have been prosecuted on charges of embezzlement.</p>
<h3>Public Education Subsidy for This Month Will Still Be Announced the Day After Tomorrow</h3>

Therefore, the in-kind subsidy and rice allowance for public education personnel for this month will still be announced on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Re-investigation and Prosecution of Three Defendants for Obstructing Freedom in Shanghai Guang Middle School Lease Dispute</h3>
<p>[Our News] In January of this year, Qin Weibin, the person in charge of Shanghai Guang Middle School, intended to restore the school. Through the introduction of his friend Liang Zhishen, he leased all twelve rooms on the three floors of No. 527 Haifang Road in this city from Yin Zhiling. It was agreed that the monthly rent would be 25 stones of white rice, a three-month security deposit, and a guarantee of 350 million yuan. Both parties signed a draft lease agreement. On February 14, Yin verbally agreed that Qin could advertise for enrollment and start working on the second floor of the building first, stating that the entire third floor could be vacated by the 23rd at the latest. On February 16, Qin moved in some school equipment and started working on the second floor. On the afternoon of the same day, he delivered 180 million legal tender, which was the equivalent of 100 stones of glutinous rice (25 stones of glutinous rice plus three months of deposit), to Yin. The next day, due to a sudden and drastic fluctuation in prices, Yin wanted Qin to convert the 350 million yuan guarantee into three and a half gold bars, but Qin refused. Yin was unhappy. On the 20th, Yin refused to allow Qin to move in school equipment and called Yin Xiaolong and Liu Jun to help block Qin from entering. As a result, a lawsuit was filed in court. The High Prosecutor's Office has recently issued an order to the District Prosecutor's Office to conduct an investigation. The investigation has now been completed, and Yin and the other two have been prosecuted on charges of obstructing freedom.</p>
<h3>Jiang Renlin Upheld Original Verdict; Hou Aichang Declared Not Guilty After Retrial in Embezzlement Case of Xingzong Staff</h3>
<p>[Our News] In the embezzlement and fraud case of Hou Aichang, former manager of the Xingzong Material Purchasing and Sales Office, and Jiang Renlin, head of the Welfare Section, the District Court's initial verdict sentenced Hou and Jiang to three years and six months of imprisonment each. Both refused to accept the verdict and applied for a retrial in the High Court. After the High Court remanded the case to the District Court for a retrial, Judge Wu Xiangzu concluded the retrial and announced the verdict yesterday: Jiang Renlin embezzled public property and was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, with deprivation of civil rights for four years. Hou Aichang was found not guilty. The reasoning stated that Jiang Renlin had used 178,080 yuan from the 5 million yuan of working capital under his custody, which was not approved for reimbursement. The handling clerk Chen Tingchang concealed the facts and could not be brought to court to provide evidence favorable to the defendant. His defense was untenable. The defendant clearly had embezzled public property and should be sentenced in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. However, after investigation, the amount of embezzlement was not large, and the circumstances were pitiful. His sentence should be reduced by one-half. For Hou Aichang, the High Court remanded the case with the intention of investigating how much wool was allocated to Anle and Zhanghua during the defendant's management period and what specific facts benefited Anle. After inquiring about the contracts signed by the defendant with the factory, the prices, and the allocation methods, there were no benefits. Therefore, he was declared not guilty.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Bureau to Convene Conscription Task Force Research Conference Today</h3>

At that time, the bureau's recently drafted "Shanghai Implementation Regulations for Regular Conscription and Family Support Plan" will be carefully reviewed and discussed. The Regiment Management District and the North Station District Office have already provided written opinions. Because the new preferential plan has a significant impact on future conscripted soldiers and their families, there will be heated debates and discussions today. After the task force decides on the principles of the plan, the revised draft will be submitted to the municipal conference's military association standing committee for discussion and approval before being promulgated and implemented.</p>
<h3>Zhang Mingyuan's Drug Trafficking Case Changed to Lengthy Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Market Tour: Vegetable Market Prices Slightly Chaotic</h3>
<p>[Our News] After the currency reform was announced and implemented, the prices of vegetables, meat, and other items in the small vegetable markets of this city yesterday morning varied greatly. Most vegetable vendors and butchers were still unclear about the content of the currency reform. Many were at a loss when setting up stalls in the early morning, and the opinions of one or two vendors often influenced the prices of the entire vegetable market. In general, prices were more standardized in the vegetable markets in bustling areas, while prices were more chaotic in the vegetable markets attached to remote residential areas. However, the prices of fish, meat, and vegetables in small vegetable markets have been rising almost every day for the past two or three weeks, and the rise has been particularly severe in recent days. Therefore, yesterday morning's fluctuations can be seen as a continuation of the trend from the previous few days. The highest price for fresh pork was 3 million yuan per catty, but some still sold it for 2.2 million yuan. Most small vegetable markets were priced between 2.4 million, 2.6 million, and 2.8 million yuan. The highest price for beef was 2 million yuan per catty, and the lowest was 1.4 million yuan, an average increase of 10% to 20% compared to the previous day. Eggs ranged from 140,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan each, depending on size. Large duck eggs were 200,000 yuan, an increase of about 20,000 yuan per egg compared to the previous day. Green vegetables, bean sprouts, and edamame were all 200,000 yuan per catty, and some were 250,000 yuan per catty. The prices of other items were slightly higher than the previous day's market prices.</p>
<p>Grain and Oil Shops: Supply Remains Normal</p>
<p>Although the food, cloth, grain, and oil cake markets in this city were ordered to close for two days, rice, oil, grain, and flour shops remained open as usual. Moreover, the supply of food in shops throughout yesterday was normal.</p>
<p>Jewelers Say Business Affected</p>
<p>Jewelers believe that the conversion rate of 200 Gold Yuan for one tael of gold, that is, 100 Gold Yuan for one tael of gold, is in line with the pre-war standard. They strongly agree with the government's decision to nationalize gold and the special laws prohibiting the sale and circulation of gold and silver. However, they believe that it will have a great impact on their future business. They are eagerly awaiting the government to promptly make regulations on whether people can freely purchase gold jewelry without restriction in the future, and where they can obtain the gold and silver on which their business depends. They believe that the turnover of the industry in the future may be less than one-tenth of the pre-war level.</p>
<p>Entertainment Industry Revived: Can Restore Prosperity</p>
<p>In the entertainment industry, cinemas were the first to express their excitement about the currency exchange news. They believe that, calculated according to the conversion rate, the current general price of the industry is lower than the pre-war level. They believe that after the currency exchange, the purchasing power of the audience will tend to stabilize, so the entertainment industry can gradually reach the pre-war prosperity standard.</p>

<h3>Mediator of Direct Tax Bureau Layoffs: Finance Ministry Commissioner Returns to Nanjing to Report; Individually Interviewed Laid-off Staff</h3>
<p>The Direct Tax Bureau's layoffs dispute has gradually subsided. Dou Menglin, the Finance Ministry Commissioner who came to Shanghai to mediate the dispute, and Zhao Peixian, the Director of Personnel, interviewed the laid-off staff individually a few days ago, asking in detail about the layoffs. However, regarding the laid-off staff's request that "the authorities revoke the order," they solemnly explained that it was an order from the central government and could not be done. The methods for reinstatement have been determined as follows: (1) Those who have passed the special examination will be allowed to be transferred to other positions. (2) The performance of transferred military officers who score below 70 points will be reviewed. If their performance is indeed excellent, they will be allowed to be reinstated. Laid-off staff are also welcome to publicly report those who should be laid off but have not been laid off in each unit. The two officials have now returned to Nanjing to report on the 18th.</p>

<h3>War Against Aphids</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yang Village, 19th Dispatch] At the end of July, when this reporter visited the rural areas of Liaozhong, farmers pointed out the harm caused by honeybugs (aphids). At that time, the disaster was still minor, and everyone eagerly hoped for rain. Farmers are most endearing, suffering from natural disasters yet hoping for salvation from nature.</p>
<p>In less than half a month, a severe aphid disaster has brewed, affecting all seven counties surrounding Shenyang. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. It is estimated that the affected agricultural area in each county is about five million mu. Only sorghum has been damaged, with an average yield of only about 50 percent. Beans and millet are fortunately unaffected. However, sorghum is the main crop in the Northeast, and the disaster of aphids competing with humans for food has become a reality, which is indeed a blow to Shenyang's goal of a moderately prosperous society. Originally, farmers dreamed beautiful summer night dreams while looking at fields of green sorghum. Now, they are watching the sorghum ears being eroded by aphids and shedding tears of sorrow.</p>
<p>Exceptionally Strong Reproduction</p>
<p>According to experts, there are many kinds of small insects. This pest is called aphid, belonging to the order Diptera. Its reproductive capacity is extremely strong, and it can reproduce more than ten to twenty generations in a year. The morphology and habits of each generation are different. Based on the shape and habits, they can be divided into winged aphids and wingless aphids. Winged aphids often move, while wingless aphids settle in one place. According to the season, they can be divided into summer parasites and winter parasites. Summer parasites live on gramineous plants, while winter parasites live on rosaceous plants. Because they like to congregate and secrete viscous liquid, they weaken and shrink the tissues of the host plants, causing poor development and affecting fruiting.</p>
<p>Four Medicines to Treat Aphids</p>
<p>The small aphids have caused great trouble to the people here, so they began to study methods of killing the insects. The Agricultural and Water Conservancy Department of the Political Committee drafted "Simple Methods for Treating and Eliminating Aphids," which listed four effective medicines: (1) Dilifensu soap solution, (2) Dilisi soap solution, (3) Tobacco water, and (4) Soap solution. It explains the method of preparation. The budget for this compound soap solution is 2 billion circulation coupons. The Municipal Council also expressed public opinion, telegraphing the Executive Yuan to immediately allocate and transport a large batch of buckwheat seeds, airlifting them to Shenyang, and advocating that farmers grow vegetables as compensation. In addition, experiments are being conducted to use DDT to kill insects, and it is planned to airlift a large amount of DDT powder from Qingdao to Shenyang to spray on nearby counties by plane. This war against insects is clearly very intense.</p>
<p>Severe Sorghum Field Disaster</p>
<p>The work of killing aphids has already begun in the suburbs of the city. According to statistics from the municipal government, the area planted with sorghum in the suburbs of the city is 26,863 mu, which has been the most severely affected and is now withered and yellow. The municipal government has purchased 40 sprayers and sent them to various districts to mobilize farmers to spray Dilisi insecticide solution.</p>
<p>Seize the Opportunity to Alleviate the Food Shortage</p>
<p>Guo Keti, Director of the Liaoning Construction Department, went to the four rural areas of Shenyang on the 9th to investigate the insect disaster. According to him, preliminary investigations showed that the loss of sorghum due to the insect disaster was 30%, and there was still hope for a harvest, so he was not very pessimistic. The authorities are trying to find remedies. However, an agricultural research friend told me that the time to spray aphids has passed, and the effect is minimal. The remedy should be to sow buckwheat, but the buckwheat seeds have not yet arrived, and I am afraid the opportunity will be missed. It is best to plant cabbage and radishes, so as to slightly alleviate the food shortage.</p>
<h3>Tragic Incident of a Poor Student in Haikou City - Save the Children!</h3>
<p>Tuition Fees Are Too High - He Suddenly Had Suicidal Thoughts - He Jumped Off a Building and His Brain Splattered - Lin Riyue Composed Two Suicide Notes with Tears</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Haikou, 17th Dispatch] At about 5:00 a.m. on the 11th, a corpse was found in the garden of the Qiongya Bookstore on Deshengsha Road. The back of the head was broken, the right hand was fractured, the right leg bone protruded from the knee, all the bones in the body were broken, and the abdomen was swollen, which was extremely frightening. After investigation, it was learned that the deceased jumped from the sun deck of the Hainan Travel Agency on the fifth floor. Next to the sun deck railing, a few empty wine bottles and peanut shells were found, indicating that the deceased had undoubtedly drunk heavily before committing suicide. Upon further inspection of the deceased's room, two suicide notes were found, one addressed to Shi Jiande, a student in the Mandarin Conversation Class of the Moral Education Association, and the other to his father, Lin Tingjing. The contents of the two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Letter to Mr. Shi Jiande:</p>
<p>"Teacher Shi Jiande: A student's intention is to achieve future goals through studying. Now that I cannot continue my studies, my future prospects are truly unimaginable. A young person must have great ambition to have hope for further studies in the future. A young person like this who cannot achieve the goal of studying can only commit suicide, which can also serve as an example for the average young person. Your student, Lin Riyue."</p>
<p>(2) Letter to Father Lin Tingjing:</p>
<p>"Dad: I never imagined that I would end my life like this. Please forgive my unfilial behavior. I am saying goodbye forever with tears in my eyes. Your son, Lin Riyue."</p>
<p>In addition, there was a note that read, "Ambitious young people! If you cannot achieve your goals of seeking knowledge, you must have such courage to be worthy of being a modern young person. I am forced by circumstances and have no choice but to commit suicide."</p>
<p>According to this reporter's investigation, the deceased was Lin Riyue, also known as Lin Minglong, over 20 years old, from Wenchang County. He was a student in the Mandarin Conversation Class of the Deyu School on Xinxing Road in this city. Recently, he had asked his father, Lin Tingjing, to continue his studies, but his father was a salaried worker with a meager monthly income, and the tuition fees for the next semester were too high, so he did not agree. The deceased was extremely discouraged by this. He had returned to his hometown a few days ago, spending a lot of money. His father reprimanded him harshly for wasting his studies and money. Unexpectedly, he had suicidal thoughts. At about 10:00 p.m. on the 8th, he went to Room 508 on the fifth floor of the Hainan Travel Agency, and stayed with a woman. The next morning, he sent the woman away and did not go out all day. On the evening of the 10th, he dressed up and went out. After a while, he returned with a bottle of wine. He walked in the corridor, seemingly lost in deep thought. At about 9:00 p.m., he went back to his room to sleep. At about 11:00 p.m., the tea attendant saw that his room door was still not closed, so he entered the room to check. At that time, the deceased was already fast asleep. Little did he know that the tragedy would happen in the early morning.</p>
<h3>Good News from the Allied Banner's Suppression of Bandits - General Manager Sa Encountered Danger Awaiting Rescue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] Information from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. The Commission received a telegram from the Chahar Provincial Government yesterday, reporting on the bandit situation in the Left Banner of Taipusi and the victorious situation of the Allied Banner Security Team in suppressing the bandits. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (1) According to Baoligeler, the head of the security team of the Duolun Lama Printing Office, in a report from Zhangjiakou on the 12th of this month: "At 12:00 on the 8th of this month, more than 200 bandits suddenly surrounded the camp of General Manager Teng of the Left Banner of Taipusi. A part of the banner's security team near the banner government had gone to Ming'an Banner with Team Leader Wen Gai last month to suppress the bandits, leaving only about 30 people. They engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits for two hours. In the end, due to the disparity in numbers, General Manager Sa and the team leader were captured. General Manager Sa's wife was stabbed in two places and seriously injured. One soldier was killed and two were injured, and all property was looted." In addition to ordering Bao Lengnamjile, the deputy commander of the first district security force of the League Banner stationed in Baochang, and Wen Gai, the captain, to quickly investigate the whereabouts of General Manager Sa and others and find a way to rescue them, an pacification payment of 100 million yuan was also issued to General Manager Sa. We have the honor to telegraph and request your review. (2) After reorganization and replenishment, the League Banner troops of this province were led by Bao Lengnamjile, the deputy commander of the first district security force of the Chahar League Banner, and Hu Turenga, the deputy commander of the first route of the Mongolian border bandit suppression, on June 20th. They were concentrated in Baochang County, northern Chahar. On the 22nd, Hu, the deputy commander, and Wen Gai, the commander of the first battalion of the first district security command of the League Banner, and Luo Buzeng, the commander of the second battalion, commanded more than 800 elite team members from various banners to penetrate into Ming'an.

In addition, the provincial people's representative body is planning to send personnel to the front line to offer condolences and improve the morale of the various units and strengthen Mongolian-Han unity. In addition to telegraphing the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Ministry of National Defense, we have the honor to report to you for review.</p>
<h3>Bumper Harvest in Hengyang - Rice Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hengyang, 14th Dispatch] (1) After the autumn harvest in Hengyang, the climate is hot like fire, and typhoid fever and dysentery are prevalent, with more children suffering. (2) Hengyang is celebrating a bumper harvest, and a large amount of new rice is on the market. Rice prices are falling daily, with top-quality rice at 240 million yuan per stone and brown rice at 160 million yuan per stone.</p>
<h3>Between Zhengzhou and Xinxiang</h3>
<p>— Our Special Reporter, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 16th Dispatch] After the Longhai Railway was dismantled, northern Henan became the rear of the isolated islands of Zhengzhou and Bianliang. Since the controlled area of northern Henan is larger than that south of the Yellow River, northern Henan has shouldered a greater responsibility for supplying the military.</p>
<p>While streamlined, air-conditioned trains are advancing victoriously on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, it is pitiful that this section of the Pinghan Railway, less than 100 kilometers long, still clings to a few locomotives and dilapidated open cars that can no longer be used to carry out the task of connecting Zhengzhou and Bianliang with northern Henan, staggering north and south of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>However, please do not underestimate it. Although the mileage is short, the energy spent on this section of railway is no less than that spent on the entire Pinghan Railway in peacetime. Take the rails, for example: from light rails of eight kilograms and sixteen kilograms to standard rails of forty-two kilograms and forty-three kilograms, in terms of length, from six meters to ten point nine meters, almost more than forty kinds of rails are all available on this section, which can be considered a rail exhibition. Take the sleepers, for example: on the section from the north bank of the Yellow River to Xiaoji Station, the sleepers have long been decayed and grown bacteria. After being constantly crushed by vehicles, the ends on both sides of the rails have been raised. To replace them, there is not only no money, but also no materials. The sleepers used for the emergency repairs on the Xin-Jiao section are still a stopgap measure, that is, even the most common stones are difficult to obtain. The Xin-Zheng section originally only went north to Xinxiang, but for the sake of stones, it was extended another twenty kilometers north to Luwangfen, which only solved the stone shortage. Otherwise, when the water level of the Yellow River rises this autumn, the bridge foundation of the Yellow River Bridge will not have stone protection, and traffic will be impossible. However, north of Xinxiang, the security is not very good, and trains are often attacked by the "Eighth Route" bandits with cold guns. Meng Renshan, the driver foreman of the Zheng'an Locomotive Depot, pointed out the bullet marks on the locomotive to me. This happened half a month ago, and the locomotive was almost destroyed. This time, five railway workers were killed or injured.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is still coal. The major mines in western Henan have been lost, and the smaller ones cannot supply enough. After the Xin-Jiao Road was cut off, the Qin River breached its banks, and the flood spread throughout Xinxiang and Jiaozuo. Coal cannot be transported out, and the eastern section of the Longhai Road has not yet been repaired. The limited amount of Jiajiang coal that is available restricts the number of trains between Xinxiang and Zhengzhou to only three round trips per week. The railway authorities are constantly paying attention to the coal reserves, counting on their fingers how long they can last.</p>
<p>My ten-minute conversation with Li Xueyi, the director of the Zhengzhou Office of the Pinghan Railway, revealed these many problems. The next day I took a train north, and the miserable carriages were filled with countless miserable passengers.</p>
<p>When the train reached the south bank of the Yellow River, the garrison had to inspect the passengers, and the inspection took one or two hours. After the victory, the military did indeed spend a lot of effort to protect this bridge, which was over thirty years old and had passed its insurance period. I hoped to take a picture, and after the stationmaster asked the regimental commander of a certain garrison for instructions, the result was not allowed. I got off the train, and the bald Mang Mountain was facing me. The concrete bunkers under the mountain accompanied the residents who lived in the cave dwellings and lived in the smell of earth all year round. In front of one or two cave dwelling doors, there were still faded spring couplets, which read: "The times are peaceful and prosperous, and people live long and healthy lives."</p>
<p>I took a short rest with Yang Hongshu, an inspector, He Jibin, the stationmaster of the North Peak Station of the Yellow River, and Li Guozhen, an engineer, in the stationmaster's office of the South Peak Station. They all reported in unison on the hardship of their lives. Their wives and children had all moved to the countryside to save some expenses. In terms of food, they said that they had not tasted meat for three months.</p>
<p>The train arrived in Xinxiang after a delay of one hour and thirty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Xinxiang has obviously increased its importance since the construction of the Daoqing Road. The enemy's ambition was even greater, and he built the Bianxin branch line, simply wanting to replace Zhengzhou's position with Xinxiang, because at that time Xinxiang was their direct westward base to the Taihang Mountains. The several wide roads in Xinxiang were all opened up by the enemy, and the several tall Western-style buildings were all built by the enemy. Therefore, DDT has been sold all over the country, but the people of Xinxiang still use the "Fly-B-Dead" invented by the enemy to drive away mosquitoes and flies, even though it is counterfeit.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Xinxiang, it was just after County Magistrate Li Kuiguang was removed from his post and investigated by the Sui District. This was the first shot of the Henan Sui District using its powers after the implementation of total war. County Magistrate Li was said to have been removed from his post because a section chief of the county government trafficked military supplies to bandits, and the county magistrate was suspected of collusion. The Xinxiang Senate listed eight major crimes. According to what was said above, Li Kuiguang was simply guilty of capital punishment. The incoming County Magistrate Xia Zhiying was the director of the Economic Department of the Twelfth Sui District Administrative Office, a native of Xinxiang. He told me that as soon as he took office, he first laid off more than 1,500 redundant employees of county-level agencies. In addition, he thoroughly investigated the accounts of the four security districts in the urban and rural areas. One of the district chiefs had embezzled 13,500 jin of wheat in less than two months in office, which, at the current price, was equivalent to more than 24 billion yuan. The normal expenditure in the district accounts included their cigarettes, bathing, and entertainment expenses.</p>
<p>The corruption of the district and town chiefs has become an even greater trauma for the people of Xinxiang on top of the burden of government corvée. A shop owner talked to me. He had some land in the countryside, and the district office sent food and money, all of which were negotiable. From the autumn of last year to the spring of this year, his fields should have been taxed 567 jin of grain, but the district chief promised to settle the matter with 420 jin. He asked the district chief: What will you do with the more than 100 jin that are paid less? The district chief replied wonderfully: Because I was worried that each household would not be able to pay enough, I had to levy more and leave a way out.</p>
<p>When I went to Xinxiang, the Chamber of Commerce and the Guild were arguing over the apportionment. In the past, all provincial public grain, county public grain, and military grain purchase price differences were traditionally borne by the business community by 25% and by the land by 75%. But now the big stores are closed, and the Chamber of Commerce requested an adjustment of the ratio. After three months of consultation, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would bear 15% and the Farmers' Association would bear 85%. As a result, the Chamber of Commerce apportioned 8,000 shi of public grain and military grain from January to May of this year according to regulations. Suddenly, the Farmers' Association did not recognize the new ratio and wanted to overturn the previous agreement. The stores protested by closing the market. The Commissioner's Office was busy entertaining guests, and Commissioner Zhang Jingzhong mediated at the banquet to resolve this dispute.</p>
<p>In Xinxiang, I met a colleague who hurriedly told me one sentence: There are many assassinations in Xinxiang. Sure enough, the next day the newspaper published that Wang Xiehe, the deputy chief of the Street Corps of Jixian County, was killed on the way back to Ji from Xin on the 29th.</p>
<p>The prevalence of assassinations has also threatened public opinion circles. The only newspaper printed on local paper in Xinxiang published a letter from a reader at the end of last month, involving the corruption of a town and district chief. The next day, a group of people came to the newspaper office to argue, beat the reporter severely, and threatened them with dangerous words. I saw that a bunker had been built inside the gate of the Da Zhong Newspaper Office, and a guard had been added.</p>
<p>This time, the breach of the Qin River, coupled with several days of heavy rain and flash floods, caused an unprecedented flood in northern Henan. Although the disaster in Xinxiang was not the most serious, the autumn harvest has already been discounted. Wheat has risen to nearly 4 million per dou, and large coal has risen to 100,000 per jin. Whenever I encounter a group of people talking, there will inevitably be a voice: "How can we live?" Autumn is coming soon, and winter is not far away. The people of Xinxiang are now first sharing the news of the emergency repair of the Xin-Jiao section, plus they heard that the government has exempted Henan's military grain. They are looking forward to a warm and well-fed winter!</p>
<h3>Resumption of Flights Between Taiwan and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Via Xiamen and Shantou Three Times a Week</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 18th Dispatch] Due to the closure of Tainan Airport, flights between Taiwan and Hong Kong were suspended. The China Airlines Corporation has now decided to resume the above-mentioned flights from this week, changing the departure point to Taipei. Flights will operate every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, via Xiamen and Shantou, directly to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Black Yi in Western Sichuan - No Expected Results Achieved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] Long-distance telephone from Shaping, Ebian County, Western Sichuan, on the 18th: Min Xiancun, section chief of the Chongqing Pacification Office, who was sent to Ebian to investigate the aftermath of the Heiyi Muganer incident, recently held a meeting in Shaping. More than 20 people attended, including National Representative Ge Chengzhi, County Senate Speaker Jia Shangling, and Councilor Zhang Taojun. During the meeting, they bitterly complained that the suppression of the Muyi had not yielded good results. Although the Muyi had surrendered, they still maintained their full military force. The 50 rifles and 2 machine guns they surrendered to the National Army were all useless. The Heiyi considered the formal guns among the treasures, and not a single one was surrendered. After the complete victory of the National Army's military operations, they still relied on force to retaliate against the Yi people, Gan Ziqing and A Niu, who helped the government during the war. In addition, they presented 140 seals of silver to the National Army, all collected from the Baiyi Wazi under their jurisdiction. Because Wang Lingji ordered that they not be accepted, they are still with the surrendered Yi representative Yasheer, and may have been embezzled by the Muyi to purchase guns and ammunition, which is a disaster for the local area.</p>
<h3>An Old Woman in Qingpu - Died of a Sneeze - Revived for a Day and Died Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingpu, 19th Dispatch] A 76-year-old woman surnamed Ren in Xiwai died suddenly on the morning of the 17th. While her family was holding a funeral, she suddenly revived. She died again suddenly in the evening of the 18th. An hour before her death, she was still talking and laughing as usual. She died with just a sneeze, and her hands and feet became stiff and cold.</p>
<h3>Tragic Scenes of Flooding in Northern Henan - Victims Wade Through Water to Other Villages to Beg for Black Noodle Soup - If Floods Don't Recede, a Spring Famine Next Year Is Inevitable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 18th Dispatch] This reporter walked dozens of miles on foot through water to Huojia and Xiuwu counties to inspect the flood situation of this unprecedented flood in northern Henan. Starting from west of Huojia City, a vast expanse of water stretches on both sides of the Xin-Jiao Railway. Huojia County is isolated in the water. To the west of Xiuwu County, the water depth on the former Xiu-Bo Highway reaches more than eight feet, making it navigable by boat. When this reporter traveled to Yangchang Village, west of Xiuwu County, the flood victims all knelt before the reporter, pleading with the government to provide relief quickly, with tears streaming down their faces. They mentioned that the greatest pain today is that, in addition to having no food to eat, a small number of illegal troops are forcibly requisitioning military grain. According to them, they are now relying on wading through water to other villages to beg for black noodles to cook soup to fill their stomachs, or picking up vegetables and discarded melon rinds to supplement their diet. This reporter has traveled hundreds of miles back and forth in the disaster area, and the autumn crops seen in the fields have almost all been drowned. There is still no definite decision on closing the breach in the Qin River. If the floods do not recede again, it will affect the planting of wheat, and the spring famine next year will be impossible to survive.</p>
<h3>Stock Bandits Roaming in Yuyao - What Are the Local Authorities Doing About It?</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yuyao, 18th Dispatch] The newly appointed County Magistrate Ying Huaizong comes from the military, but he has not made active preparations for security, resulting in the increasingly rampant and rapidly spreading trend. Recently, the Communist bandits in northern Yao responded to the call of the bandits in Siming Mountain and have become active again. On the evening of the 17th, they kidnapped the eldest son of Sun Xuetai, the chairman of the Rural Farmers' Association in Longnan Township, and Sun Jiemei, the principal of the Hujingdian Village Bao School in Pengjing Township. It is also rumored that Sun has been murdered. In the Yandang Lake Village of Fengting Township in the southern township, more than 20 Communist bandits armed with modern weapons were discovered at about 11:00 p.m. the night before. After staying on a ridge, they fled towards Shengzhuling. The Communist bandits roaming in Mojia Lake forced the Jia chiefs to hold a meeting. The Jia chiefs were forced to attend due to their power. The bandit leader Xia Jilin preached resistance to conscription and grain collection, and the severance of intelligence. Afterwards, they fled to various districts, holding propaganda meetings in return, which made the masses feel more uneasy.</p>
<h3>Eight People Died of Sleeping Sickness in Chengdu</h3>

<h3>A Tragic Love Affair and Murder in Yuqian: Meeting a New Paramour and Plotting to Harm the Old Lover; Li Tinggen Poisoned</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Yuqian dispatch on the 18th] Lan Jinhua, the 31-year-old wife of Zhong Jianwen from Zhulinwu, Thirteenth Bao, Qianyang Town, became romantically involved with Li Tinggen from the same village due to her husband working in the Northeast. They became deeply attached and lived together. Zhu Yugen, a prisoner held at the Yuqian Detention Center, was sentenced to six years for a previous murder case. Last year, his sentence was reduced by three years, and he was soon to be released. He was serving his sentence outside of prison under the guarantee of a certain oil merchant. Zhu was young and handsome and also became passionately involved with Lan Jinhua. The affair between Zhu and Lan intensified to the point where they conspired to poison Li Tinggen's food. Li suffered from severe stomach pain after being poisoned and desperately sought a quick death by running around in confusion and attempting to hang himself from the roof beam. His condition was extremely distressing. Li's wife discovered the plot and immediately reported the incident to the county's judicial office for an autopsy. An examination was conducted by the public hospital, confirming that he had indeed been poisoned and that his life was in danger. The judicial office immediately arrested Lan Jinhua and Zhu Yugen, and they are currently under strict interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Coal Mine in Jiaozuo Paralyzed: Triple Difficulties of Security, Transportation, and Economy; Daily Output of Over a Hundred Tons for Retail Only</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Xinxiang airmail dispatch on the 18th] Our newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch: Your correspondent, under the heavy guard and amid the sparse gunfire of the communist bandits along the way, crossed the area where communist bandits roamed between Xiuwu and Jiaozuo and arrived in Jiaozuo, and visited the Wangfeng and Lifeng mining areas separately. Currently, due to security and transportation issues, the mine is in a state of semi-shutdown, with a daily coal output of only a hundred and several tens of tons, only enough for retail sales. A month ago, the highest quality Yuhe coal produced by the mine was selling for only 5.5 million per ton, but now it only sells for 18 million. According to Liu Xiangshan, the director of the mine's general management office, the mine has been struggling to maintain continuous coal production since the Xin-Jiao railway was cut off last July. Currently, the most difficult problems for the mine to solve, besides security, are economic ones. Workers' wages for July and staff salaries for June and July have not been paid. Many workers are supporting themselves by setting up small stalls. Furthermore, the mine is finding it difficult to deal with unreasonable demands from certain quarters. According to investigations, the amount of coal lost each month due to these demands exceeds 4,000 tons. Mr. Liu concluded by saying that the mine's only hope lies in the reopening of the Xin-Jiao railway and the stability of the area around Jiaozuo; otherwise, if this situation continues, the mine will inevitably be forced to shut down after struggling with great difficulty.</p>
<h3>Prelude to the American Election (II): Vandenberg's Anger</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's Special Correspondent in America Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's New York airmail dispatch on July 25th] When Truman accepted the Democratic Party's nomination as presidential candidate at the National Convention, he made a rather resounding speech. He said that the biggest difficulty he faced during his term was the obstruction of the Republican Congress. The federal government's insufficient emphasis on educational development, the nationwide "housing shortage" that has not been completely resolved, and the inability to curb rising prices and inflation were all due to the Republican-controlled Congress obstructing him at every turn. He said that he had always opposed the Taft-Hartley Labor Act because it harmed the rights of workers, but the Republican Congress insisted on passing it. He said that he would continue to fight for the Democratic Party's established platform and policies.</p>
<p>Truman's words were consistent with Barkley's speech. Barkley, the 70-year-old senior senator from Kentucky, gave one of the most brilliant performances at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia in mid-July. Barkley's long speech was eloquent and vented a lot of frustration for the Democratic Party itself. He denounced the Republican Party's "malicious attacks" on the Democratic Party in its propaganda, and he defended President Roosevelt's "New Deal." He spoke of the tragic situation in America during the Hoover era in 1932, saying, "Fortunately, President Roosevelt's brilliant new economic policy saved the overall situation in America." He said: "Today, Republicans are defying their conscience and creating propaganda everywhere, scolding us as New Dealers, making Americans think that New Dealers are monsters. We Democrats and patriotic citizens of America should not be misled by such malicious attacks. We are New Dealers because America has the Roosevelt's New Deal, that's why we have today's situation"!</p>
<p>Barkley defended the Truman administration by comparing today with 1932. That day, Truman sent a telegram from the White House congratulating him on the success of his speech. At that time, the question of the vice-presidency was still undecided. Truman originally wanted to invite Justice Douglas of the Supreme Court to run. Douglas was originally widely supported "to run for president to replace the mediocre Truman." Douglas lived on the West Coast and declined all support. Senator McConaughey was rumored to be the earliest candidate for vice president, but he was from the "Midwest," like Truman. Truman himself wanted to find a vice president from the East or from either coast to be his running mate, which was originally based on the idea of democratic convention.</p>
<p>However, after Barkley's speech, he suddenly won the infinite support of the masses, and the vice-presidential nomination fell on Barkley without contention. For the Democratic Party itself, Barkley's candidacy as Truman's "running mate" had more disadvantages than advantages. The reasons were: (1) Barkley was from Kentucky, in the middle of the country, and had no connection to the East or West Coast. From a geographical point of view, the East and West Coasts have denser populations and more voters, and the Democratic Party would therefore lose votes. (2) Barkley was 70 years old this year, which was excessively old to be a vice-presidential candidate. Although Barkley's vigor was comparable to that of Léon Blum of France, Blum's attempt to "form a cabinet" still failed in the French parliament the year before. Before Barkley decided to accept the nomination, several Democratic Party "bosses" (generally called bosses in the United States), such as Hague of New Jersey and Avey of Chicago, advised Barkley to "think twice." Their opinion was that at 70 years old, he should no longer block the "path of virtue" and give the opportunity to younger successors. But the result was still ineffective.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if the Democratic Party is bound to fail in the November election, then whether the "running mate" is young or old will not make much difference. According to Truman himself, he is very confident of "victory" in the November election because he believes that his inability to make sweeping changes in domestic affairs is not the fault of his executive branch, but rather the failure of the Republican 80th Congress to smoothly pass his proposals. He is confident that the American people should understand his plight and hate the Republican Party. Therefore, after returning to the White House from Philadelphia, his first action was to order a special session of both houses of Congress to discuss emergency domestic programs.</p>
<p>The White House press office told reporters: The day the Democratic Convention ended, the President rushed back to Washington from Philadelphia, arriving at 12:30 at night. At 5:00 in the morning, the President was already seen sitting in his office in the White House. Many people suspected that the President had not slept all night, and that he was now beginning to "face the enemy" and fight against the strong Republican lineup.</p>
<p>According to American practice, both houses of Congress take a vacation every summer, just like the Legislative Yuan in China now. The American Constitution stipulates that the President has the power to convene a special session during the congressional recess to urgently discuss important national policies if necessary. According to a report by Knowles, the New York Times' correspondent in the capital: "A sitting president who is running for the next presidential term suddenly convening a special session during the congressional recess is unprecedented in American history. But President Truman actually did it!"</p>
<p>The Republican Party strongly opposed the President's order to convene a special session of Congress. Republicans in Washington called Truman's move a "petty trick" and a "small conspiracy," and some called Truman's move a "low-level political game." The person who was particularly outraged was Vandenberg, who was in Michigan. Vandenberg told reporters for the Associated Press that "Truman's call is the last gasp of a dying regime." He said: "I don't believe there is any earth-shattering emergency that requires convening such a special session to discuss!"</p>
<p>A senior politician like Vandenberg, who has prestige and weight, never complains or swears at people. This time, his indignation at Truman's "petty tricks" is probably the first time I have seen him angry. But he still had to go to Washington to attend, and they would never shirk their responsibilities.</p>
<p>The special session of Congress is to open tomorrow, only eleven days after Truman issued the call. In his speech accepting the nomination at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia on July 14, Truman lashed out at the Republican-controlled Congress. He also said: Today, since all the comrades of the Democratic Party still nominated him to run for the next presidential term, he must implement the party's agenda, and he must realize these propositions and complete the legislative procedures within fifteen days.</p>
<p>Applying the party's decisions to politics, Truman returned to Washington in the middle of the night on July 14 and ordered a special session of Congress early on the 15th. Barkley, who was still in Philadelphia at the time, was overjoyed when he heard the call. He gave a thumbs-up: "Good brave president, did the right thing!"</p>
<p>Of course, Truman will raise his voice in the special session and put on his most brilliant performance. Increase education funding, allocate funds to build houses, relieve European refugees, open immigration restrictions, curb inflation, strictly control prices – all the things that the American people are asking the government for today will all be spread from Truman's mouth to Congress. If Congress refuses to pass them, that is Congress's responsibility. Who is the majority party in Congress? Who controls Congress? The American people all know it is the Republican Party! Truman's move is certainly very "spicy," but also very powerful!</p>
<p>How will the Republican Party respond? Of course, it will take considerable thought. The day Truman issued the call, Taft met with Dewey, and they certainly had a secret discussion. Outside reports said that Republican senators would immediately propose "adjournment" after listening to Truman's speech, giving Truman a cold shoulder. Giving a cold shoulder to Truman's bill is of no consequence, but every tax-paying citizen in America has to share a huge travel expense of 222,000 US dollars. According to a report in the New York Daily News! The travel expenses include the Senate and the House of Representatives. The travel expenses for the 96 senators amount to 51,000 yuan. The travel expenses for the 435 representatives amount to 171,000 yuan.</p>
<p>More than 220,000 dollars is truly insignificant in the US Treasury's expenditure. The problem is that this "special session" may make the election competition between the Democratic and Republican parties more acute. Add to that Wallace's third party and the South's fourth party, making the picture of the American election in November more vivid and tense!</p>

<h3>After the Implementation of the New Currency System, Banks and Financial Institutions Should First Rectify Themselves</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the news of the currency system reform reached the city the night before, most banks and financial institutions spent the night sorting out their accounts. Yesterday morning, Chen Duoru, the representative of the banking industry in the city, and Shen Rixin, the representative of the Money Industry Association, visited Bi Delin, the deputy director of the Financial Control Bureau, to consult on certain matters. According to Mr. Shen Rixin, the new measures include a six-month period to eliminate banks and financial institutions with insufficient capital. In addition to banks and financial institutions rectifying themselves first, it is hoped that the government can be more cautious in setting the required capital amount. According to general observations, after the opportunities for speculation are reduced with the issuance of the new currency, banks and financial institutions with unsound contents will inevitably be naturally eliminated. It is reported that the Financial Control Bureau dispatched 15 inspection teams yesterday to supervise various banks and financial institutions, prohibiting any deposit or lending activities.</p>
<p>Further News: Lin Chongyong, the Director of the Financial Control Bureau, took the night train to Nanjing the day before to attend the talks held by the Executive Yuan yesterday (20th), and took the opportunity to request instructions from the Ministry on the control measures during the transition period, and will return to Shanghai soon.</p>

<h3>Gasoline, Diesel, and Fuel Oil Prices: The Import and Export Control Committee Re-approves Adjustments; The Second Adjustment This Month, Up 40 Percent</h3>
<p>The prices of gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil were adjusted and increased again yesterday by the Import and Export Control Committee as follows: (1) Gasoline was adjusted to 4.96 million per gallon, an increase of 1.61 million compared to the previous price. (2) Light diesel oil with a kerosene content of 80% or more was adjusted to 811.892 million per ton, an increase of 217.772 million compared to the previous price. (3) Light diesel oil with a kerosene content of less than 80% was adjusted to 632.714 million per ton, an increase of 174.459 million compared to the previous price.

The main reason for the adjustment, according to the person in charge of the Import and Export Control Committee, is due to the increase in the price of import exchange settlement certificates and the sharp increase in the cost of living for workers, with an average increase of 40%. The various oil companies in this city have been selling at the new prices since yesterday. It is heard that all these oils will be sold at Gold Yuan prices starting next week.</p>
<h3>New Tobacco Leaves Have Arrived on the Market; Tobacco Merchants Are Buying</h3>
<p>Recently, with new tobacco leaves arriving on the market from various places, the tobacco leaf companies in this city, in order to supply the raw materials needed by the various cigarette factories in this city and for the sake of their own business development, have sent people to various production areas to purchase high-quality tobacco leaves such as smoked tobacco and native tobacco. Their routes have spread almost all over the country. Xuchang, Henan, which used to be the leader in the domestic tobacco leaf market, has suffered repeated wars, and its output and reputation are not as good as before. Currently, what can be shipped to Shanghai is still goods from Hankou and other places in the past. However, the tobacco leaves in the Kunming area of Yunnan, due to proper cultivation, produce high-quality tobacco leaves, which are now superior to Xuchang leaves, and their prices are also the most expensive. In addition to the tobacco leaves from Kunming and Xuchang, the next best are those produced in Qingzhou and Fengge. The next purchasing target is mostly concentrated on the Bengbu and Fengyang leaves. As of now, more than 20 merchants have successively dispatched purchasing agents to purchase new tobacco leaves. However, due to purchase negotiations and transportation relations, it is expected that the new tobacco leaves will arrive in Shanghai in about two months.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Remittances from Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] Remittances to Tianjin from Northeast China have surged in August. According to statistics from the Tianjin Financial Management Bureau, from the 1st to the 10th, they reached 71 trillion yuan, more than double the 23 trillion yuan for the entire month of July.</p>
<h3>Implementing Emergency Economic Measures - Great Benefits for Export Businesses - Government to Implement Export Price Limits</h3>
<p>To cooperate with the government's currency reform, the Export Control Committee convened a discussion meeting yesterday afternoon with leaders from various export industries in the city. The meeting was presided over by Chen, the director of the Export Promotion Department of the committee, with representatives from the Central Bank and other institutions also in attendance. The meeting's content focused on discussing concrete steps to coordinate with the government's efforts to streamline finances and tighten economic controls.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the government's current currency reform is of great benefit to the export industry, and China's various export goods will be able to be exported in large quantities. However, to avoid exporters competing with each other and engaging in dumping, the government has decided to implement export price limits to stabilize overseas markets, earn foreign exchange, and maintain the interests of exporters. The export price limit will be based on the overseas market conditions of the 19th of this month as the price standard. For example, Tianjin No. 55 long bristles will be priced at US$9.60 per pound CIF, tung oil at US$0.20 per pound CIF, and soybeans at 37 British shillings per ton FOB Shanghai, etc. During the meeting, exporters requested that the authorities settle foreign exchange at a rate of 4 new yuan to 1 US dollar, deducting the original foreign exchange benchmark price (474,000 old legal tender yuan). They also requested a reduction in export loan interest rates, calculated according to pre-war interest rates. The authorities have reportedly already made decisions on these matters and will announce them soon.</p>
<h3>Export Control Committee Announces Last Week's Export Situation</h3>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Market Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>The Export Control Committee announced yesterday the export and foreign exchange settlement situation for the week of August 8th to 14th: From the 8th to the 14th, domestic market prices for exported goods continued to rise, increasing by an average of 27% compared to the previous week. Foreign market prices were generally stable, with only Tianjin No. 26 and Hankou No. 17 pig bristles and feathers showing slight increases, while soybeans and tung oil fell. The exchange certificate price market remained strong, reaching 7.7 million at the end of the week, with a weekly average of approximately 6,655,000 yuan, an increase of 17% compared to the previous week. Based on the domestic and foreign market prices at the beginning of the week and the exchange certificate rate at that time, exports of Shanghai and Hankou pig bristles, feathers, casings, and egg products could generate profits, with raw cowhide being particularly profitable. However, Tianjin products, edible oil, gauze, Chinese medicine, and gallnuts incurred losses due to excessive domestic price increases. The current export market conditions for major export products this week are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Tung Oil: Foreign market prices were stable, with New York C.I.F. fluctuating between US$0.195 and US$0.20 per pound, and Shanghai F.O.B. only US$0.1725 per pound. At the beginning of the week, export losses were approximately 20%. However, because market prices in the mainland and South China were much lower than in Shanghai, many local tung oil exporters purchased from these areas, reportedly transporting up to 4,000 dan per day to Shanghai. Exports through Hong Kong also increased in July.</p>
<p>Pig Bristles: Foreign market prices were slightly better, with short bristles of Hankou No. 17 and Tianjin No. 26 both rising. On Monday, the C.I.F. New York prices were US$4.40 and US$6.60 per pound, respectively. There were no other changes. Exports of Hankou bristles were more profitable, at approximately 25%, while Shanghai bristles barely covered costs, and the rest incurred losses. Exports through Hong Kong remained active in July, with some being bartered to Japan.</p>
<p>Tea: Arrivals were few, and market prices were strong. Precious eyebrow, needle eyebrow, and special grade goods were in high demand overseas, but offers were stingy, and the market remained stagnant. It was recently heard that large merchants were purchasing Taiwan tea for transport, and prices also rose sharply, reducing shipments to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Raw Silk: Foreign market conditions were calm, with D-grade goods priced at US$3 per pound C.I.F. New York, and Shanghai F.O.B. at US$2.80. Exports incurred slight losses. However, due to the favorable exchange certificate rate, export activity has begun, with the market still in the United States, but the volume of transactions is minimal.</p>
<p>Pig Casings: At the beginning of the week, the domestic price for 13.5-yard casings increased by 20% compared to the previous week. Foreign prices were stable, with Shanghai F.O.B. prices at US$0.1875. Due to the increase in the exchange certificate price, export profits still reached 22%.</p>
<p>Feathers: Domestic and foreign prices both rose. Duck and goose feathers Shanghai F.O.B. rose to US$0.375 and US$0.535 per pound, respectively, with export profits of approximately 10%.</p>
<p>Gauze and Textiles: Although domestic prices rose sharply, foreign prices remained stable. Demand from Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia, was very strong. However, with the rising price of raw cotton and the difficulty in supply, domestic factories were facing a severe threat, and exports were unlikely to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Mineral Ores: Export conditions have become more active, mainly due to the increased U.S. demand for tin and antimony. Government and private businesses are both shipping to Hong Kong. Merchants from Southeast Asia and India are going to Hong Kong to purchase goods. Factories that relocated to Hong Kong also have demand, so sales in Hong Kong have become smoother.</p>

Their telegram to the Ministry of Education, in addition to reiterating the province-wide consensus on the careful selection of talented individuals, also stated, "A sporadic incident caused by a shortage of food among a small number of students cannot be regarded as a student movement. If this is grounds for dissolution, then why can't the schools involved in the 109 student movements across the country be dissolved?" Furthermore, the students of the college have also written to Wang Wenjun, opposing the reorganization committee's measures for re-registration.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Yucai Middle School Issues Statement: Students' Ideologies are Pure</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Principal's Office of Shanghai Yucai Middle School issued a statement yesterday stating: On the 18th and 19th of this month, various newspapers in the city published an article released by the relevant authorities in Nanjing entitled "Ironclad Evidence of Communist Spies Inciting Pure Students to Create Student Movements," which included a passage stating that "Yucai Middle School is one of the Communist Party's strongholds for student movements in Shanghai, and some of the school's graduates have been sent to Communist-controlled areas this summer." There are three "Yucai Middle Schools" in Shanghai. One is "Yucai School," founded by Tao Xingzhi, located in Dachang. The second is "Private Yucai Middle School," located on Shanzhong Road in the city. Our school was founded by the former Municipal Council and was originally named "Yucai Public School." After the war, it was transferred to the city and is now called "Shanghai Municipal Yucai Middle School," located at the intersection of Shanhai Pass Road and Carter Road. The students of our school have pure ideologies and are dedicated to their studies. They have never been involved in external affairs. The graduates of this summer were all busy applying to famous universities in Beijing and Shanghai in order to pursue further studies. In order to avoid any misunderstanding of our school by the outside world, in addition to investigating the truth of the matter with the relevant authorities, we hereby issue this statement to clarify the facts.</p>

<h3>Thrilling Victory by the World Games Basketball Team - A One-Point Win Over Korea</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent for this newspaper, Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper from London by airmail] After yesterday's heavy rain, the weather in London has become very cool, like late autumn. According to people who have lived in the UK for a long time, this is the standard British weather.</p>
<p>After defeating the Belgian team yesterday (August 2nd), our national basketball team played its first round-robin match against the Korean team at the Harringay Arena at 9:00 PM tonight. The Korean team's coordination was quick and skillful, and their shooting was accurate. In terms of skill, they were better than the Chinese team. Therefore, from the beginning of the game to the last second, the Korean team was always in the lead. Finally, our army was blessed. In the last second, the left forward Shi Qiao made an incredible shot from ten yards away with a backward single-handed throw. The ball had just left his hand when time ran out, and the Chinese team was declared victorious. Such a thrilling game was unprecedented in this World Games basketball tournament. Our national basketball team has won twice, and foreigners are looking at us with new respect. This can be considered a triumph for our country's delegation to the World Games and a victory for the people of the country. The progress of the game is recorded below:</p>
<p>Wu Cheng Zhang Li Shi Qiao</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong Huang Tianxi Zhi Jun Bao Songyuan</p>
<p>Korean Team Led All the Way</p>
<p>After the tip-off, the Korean team was very aggressive and scored two consecutive goals with quick passes. Cai Wenhua of our army committed a foul and was penalized with another goal. The Korean team took a 5-0 lead in three minutes. Our army quickly counterattacked. Li Shiqiao shot from afar and brushed the net, and Huang Tianxi jumped up and rebounded, pulling back two goals. The Korean team responded with several well-executed shots, and our army was still behind 6-14, a difference of eight points. After this, the Chinese players were slightly flustered, and the formation became looser. Free throws were repeatedly missed. In addition, Cai Wenhua had a slight pain when he entered the court, so his normally reliable long-range shots failed. Despite the best efforts of Li Shiqiao and Wu Chengzhang, it was to no avail. At the end of the first half, the Korean team was far ahead with a score of 28-16. During the break, the Chinese spectators and players were very frustrated. But in all fairness, there was no reason to complain about the Chinese team's defeat. The Korean team members were not only physically fit and well-rounded, but also extremely well-coordinated. In addition, their shooting was accurate, so it was impossible for our army to win.</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong, the Veteran in the Whole Field</p>
<p>After the change of ends in the second half, our army's attack was still weak. Coach Song Junfu immediately sent the veteran Li Zhenzhong onto the field to replace Huang Tianxi, and the situation improved. Li Zhenzhong's long-range shot was successful, and his command was appropriate. He was worthy of being a basketball veteran. Right forward Wu Chengtong also scored two consecutive goals with a quick movement, and the situation gradually improved. But in the end, due to the disparity in strength, there was no certainty of victory. Until the last quarter, the score was 39-41, only one goal behind. At this time, the Chinese and foreign spectators on both sides of the stands shouted "China Team Go!". But in an instant, the fleeting opportunity disappeared, and the Korean team took the lead again with a score of 47-41. At this time, the veteran Li Zhenzhong came on the field again, worked hard to command, and launched a counterattack. In the last three minutes, Li Shiqiao and Wu Chengzhang made successive contributions, and the score soared. The score was 47-48, only one point behind.</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao Brought a Comeback</p>
<p>The end of the game was imminent. At this critical moment, left forward Li Shiqiao suddenly jumped up and made a single-handed shot from ten yards away, and it was successful! Just as the ball left his hand, the recorder's second hand pointed to twelve o'clock, and the bell rang, signaling the end of the game. The Chinese team was declared the winner with a score of 49-48 over the Korean team. At this time, the audience burst into thunderous applause and cheers, and the enthusiastic scene of the spectators and players was beyond words. Li Shiqiao, a member of the Chinese basketball team, was greatly appreciated by foreigners for this incredible shot, and was hailed as a "Chinese Prodigy" because he was young and small. But the contributions of right forward Wu Chengzhang and center Cai Wenhua should not be ignored. Tomorrow afternoon at 7:00 PM, they will face the formidable opponent, the Philippines. The Philippines is very strong, but they were defeated by Chile 68-39 this afternoon. It seems that there is hope for tomorrow's game. If we can win three games against other countries, our country can enter the finals, which would be an unprecedented achievement for our World Games team.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Team Suffers Defeat in Bangkok - Loses to Overseas Chinese Team 35-41</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 19th] The overconfident Chinese World Games basketball team lost to the Overseas Chinese team here today by a score of 41 to 35. Today happened to be the Ghost Festival on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month, and the audience was unprecedentedly crowded. The World Games team led 11 to 8 in the first quarter, but by the end of the second quarter, the Overseas Chinese team had taken the lead 18 to 17. Most of the audience felt that the World Games team was too polite and that the home team played exceptionally well. In the third quarter, Bao Songyuan entered the game, and the Overseas Chinese team scored 13 points while the visiting team only scored 6 points. Surprised, the World Games team substituted Cai Zhongqiang in the fourth quarter, who cooperated with Bao Songyuan. The score once came close to 35 to 33, but the home team still maintained the lead and ultimately defeated the World Games team 41 to 35, thanks to their good fortune. The World Games team arrived here yesterday afternoon, and the journey was tiring. The absence of Li Shiqiao and Huang Tianxi was also a major reason for the defeat.</p>

<h3>Summer Vacation Tutors Awaiting Employment</h3>
<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Answered by Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</p>
<p>(Tang Wendong, of Shuimin Road, asks) Our household received a telephone bill, and the number of calls did not match the actual number and was much higher. Averaging five calls per day, the total for the month should not exceed two hundred. However, our household has never exceeded five calls per day. Please investigate and reply.</p>
<p>(Answer) The Bureau's call counting is based on automatic machine records, which rarely have errors. After inspecting the machine lines, there were no obstacles. It is presumed that your records are inaccurate, as it is unreasonable for there to be overcounting.</p>
<p>(Li Guangbin, of Renji Road, asks) What is the procedure for canceling a long-distance call? Under what circumstances can a "free cancellation" be made?</p>
<p>(Answer) After registering for a long-distance call, you can apply for cancellation yourself. A "free cancellation" can be made if one of the following four situations occurs: (1) A line or machine suddenly malfunctions, preventing connection to the called party's exchange; (2) The called party has been reached, but the line suddenly breaks down; (3) The line is congested after registration; (4) The called party has already called first.</p>

<h3>Zhu Ziqing's Prose</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Because of Zhu's death, I can't help but reread Zhu's prose. I feel that Zhu's writing style differs significantly between his early and later years. This is probably not unique to Zhu, nor is it unique to the literary field. Any writer's early works and works after becoming famous often have significant differences. In terms of thought, they can even be completely different.</p>
<p>Early prose writers generally had a long history of writing classical Chinese prose, just like early new poetry writers were all classical poets. Therefore, the prose of that time always seemed unable to escape the influence of classical Chinese, unable to reach the point of "using the pen like a tongue" (Zhu's advocacy in his article "Speaking"). The most obvious example is "The Qinhuai River in Paddle Sounds and Lantern Shadows," which Zhu and Yu jointly wrote in 1923. It not only contains remnants of old-style prose but also floats with the lingering charm of old poetry. Please see the following sentences; are they common in today's prose?</p>
<p>"... But the lamplight ultimately could not overshadow the moonlight over there. The lamplight was muddy, and the moonlight was clear. It was truly a miracle for a stream of clear brilliance to seep into the turbid lamplight! The moon was already two or three parts thinner that night; she had just finished her evening makeup and gracefully ascended the willow tips. The sky was a lovely blue, as if it were a pool of water, making the moon even more energetic... But the lamplight and moonlight could coexist and blend together, making the moon a lingering moon, and the lamplight shooting out faint spiritual brilliance. This is precisely Heaven's favor to the Qinhuai River, and it is precisely Heaven's favor to us."</p>
<p>These kinds of sentences have even more twists and turns than Yongzhou's Eight Records and are quite like Song Dynasty slow-paced lyrics. If compared with Zhu's most popular "Back View" essay, they are clearly two different types. To be honest, Zhu did not like or approach this type, so we feel that he did not write this essay ideally. For example, his later travel notes about Europe are not in this tone. Originally, there were two paths at the beginning of the new prose era. If we take Zhu's works as an example, one is the "Back View" type, and the other is the "Qinhuai Moon" type. There are many who belong to the "Back View" type, and those who belong to the latter, in addition to Yu Pingbo, also include Fei Ming and He Qifang. They are somewhat obscure, making it difficult for people to understand.</p>
<p>Yu Pingbo has written very little prose recently, so it's difficult to definitively say how his style has changed. In any case, he was deeply influenced by old poetry in his early years, as seen in the Qinhuai essay he wrote with Zhu. As for Zhu, it can be said that he went from extreme magnificence to plainness, or that he became closer and closer to his true nature. In short, his recent works can be said to have achieved the form of moving from broad to concise, from artificial to purely natural. Zhu said in his article "Speaking":</p>
<p>"Speaking is not necessarily more difficult than writing, but it is definitely not easier. Some people can speak but cannot write, but some people can write but cannot speak. Speaking is like flowing clouds and flowing water, and it is impossible to scrutinize it word by word. Therefore, there are inevitably omissions and looseness, which is not as rigorous as writing. However, the naturalness of flowing clouds and flowing water cannot be reached by ordinary articles—if an article can reach this state, it should simply be regarded as speaking and no longer as writing. But what a difficult state this is to reach!..."</p>
<p>These words are not only his creative theory but can also be said to be an indicator of his recent writing. The realm of flowing clouds and flowing water is indeed not easy to reach, but Zhu's freshness and fluency can indeed reach this realm. I very much agree with two paragraphs in his "Flying":</p>
<p>"Indeed, you can watch the sunrise and sunset in the ocean, but you have to be lucky. The sunrise and sunset are meaningful only with the setting off of clouds and rosy clouds; otherwise, a dull sun is simply a fool! Although clouds and rosy clouds are often present, they are often faint and lazy, which is still meaningless. They must be rich and change, with a new pattern emerging in the blink of an eye to be worth watching. This is something that can be encountered but not sought... The sky is like the sea, also large and monotonous. There seems to be no shortage of literature and art about the sun, moon, stars, and clouds, but they are all looking up from below. There is not much said about the entire sky. There is a little bit about the starry sky and the night sky, but apart from words like 'blue sky,' 'bright blue sky,' or 'gloomy sky,' there seems to be nothing else to say about the sky. However, even if a person sitting on an airplane for the first time has little background in literature or art to help his imagination, he still has the imagination of 'letting the birds fly in the sky.' Coupled with the experience of others, looking down from above, it seems that it is not just vast but also has the churning sea of clouds and the flat brocade. This is enough to ponder."</p>
<p>If you use this kind of realm to describe Zhu's work, do you think it is a dull, melon-like sun? No, no, it is not so fanatical and dazzling. Do you think he is a blue sky? No, no, it is not as stagnant and silent. He is precisely the sea of clouds seen on an airplane, the early sun with a new pattern emerging in the blink of an eye. Those who do not understand only feel that it is very ordinary, but those who have some literary cultivation feel that the "churning sea of clouds" and "flat brocade" provide us with endless images. (Compare the writing style with the one quoted earlier, is it the same?)</p>
<p>Zhu passed away at the young age of fifty, and his future achievements would have been far more than this. I hope that young people will continue the legacy of their predecessors in prose and not, like a certain newspaper in Nanjing, produce an incomprehensible classical Chinese eulogy to mourn him. If all his "students" are like this, Zhu will not rest in peace even in death!</p>
<h3>Talking about Cheating on Exams</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zongyu</p>
<p>Under the examination system of imperial examinations, getting into university is indeed not an easy task. Coupled with the collapse of the social economy in the past ten years, the threshold of national universities has become even more daunting in order to reduce the burden on families. We often see that young people themselves, or even their fathers and brothers, often rack their brains to think of various ways to enable themselves or their children to "succeed in the imperial examination." The most common method is, of course, the practice of "seeking help," so before and after the annual entrance examination, principals, deans, and professors can receive piles of "introductions" that are full of pitiful situations such as "My child, suffering from ×××, is determined to pursue further education but cannot find the door." However, precisely because there are so many introducers, it is really not easy to be accepted. As a result, one can only be shelved aside with "help as much as possible within the possible range." Therefore, although the practice of seeking help is prevalent, I am afraid that it is of little effect. Since this easiest and most dignified method has become ineffective, with the progress of the times, the tricks that have followed have become increasingly innovative. Things like smuggling notes, peeking at others, and flipping through books are outdated and unreliable, and the risk is too great. Although these tricks can still be seen in the examination hall, they are all "pitiable" "latecomers" who are disdained by the "advanced" "inventors."</p>
<p>The first so-called new method is "improved proxy examination." The key to this technique is whether one can get through when checking the photo on the registration form and certificate during registration. As long as the appearance of the hired proxy examiner does not have obvious differences, or after passing through photographic technology, the staff is often too tired of that kind of mechanical work in the crowded and messy situation of registration, they will often overlook it. If this barrier is passed, you can take the exam without any worries. However, after admission, many schools require verifying handwriting, but most of them are just a formality. Even if there are some minor problems, they can be explained away with reasons such as different moods during the exam, different pens, etc. The author is a student who has not been in university for long, and I have seen this kind of thing happen many times.</p>
<p>The second type is exchanging exam papers. This is one of the so-called "escort examination" methods. Two people apply for the same department, and the seats during the exam, even if there is a gap, are not very far apart. When the exam papers are distributed, they have been waiting at the first stack at the entrance of the examination hall. When the bell rings for the first time, the two quickly run to each other's seats. When everyone walks into the examination hall like a tide, they can take the exchanged exam papers to their original positions in the chaos. This situation often occurs in large examination halls with hundreds of people or more.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the most advanced "escort," in which two, three, or even five or six "masters" are hired in advance to register at the same time for a large-scale "escort examination." Although the seat numbers during the exam cannot be completely together, as long as one of them is on the left or right, the goal has been achieved. In the current examination halls with limited space and a large number of people, there is almost no distance between seats, so exchanging exam papers, glancing at each other and copying, are all as desired. It can be said that it is the culmination of various cheating methods.</p>
<p>Cheating on exams has probably been around since ancient times, and it is even worse today! The author's knowledge is limited, and I have inevitably failed to collect everything, but this is enough to surprise people. These are all products of the times and the system. Gentlemen in charge of education, if you think that the examination system still has value, then this phenomenon should be noted. Otherwise, it should be fundamentally considered.</p>
<h3>American Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>The United States has sold 98% of its surplus materials overseas. These materials originally had a value of $10,547,845,500. The U.S. government sold them at 20% of their value, receiving $1,962,800,400. Before planting seedlings, American farms now pass the seedlings through ultrasonic waves with extremely high vibration rates, which are said to accelerate the growth of the trees. Potatoes that have passed through ultrasonic waves mature earlier than ordinary potatoes, and these potatoes are particularly large.</p>
<p>The United States also implements daylight saving time, which is scheduled to end on September 26 this year. However, California and Nevada are preparing to extend it until January next year to save electricity.</p>
<p>The crime rate among American veterans has surged. More than a quarter of the criminals in federal prisons are veterans who participated in World War II, and the proportion of these veterans in state prisons is more than half.</p>
<p>The United States has been feeling a leather panic in recent years and recently airlifted 30,000 snake skins from Siam and India for the manufacture of women's shoes, handbags, belts... and other items.</p>
<h3>Mustache Cover</h3>
<p>— An Ru</p>
<p>When I was a child, reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms, there was a passage that I can still remember today, which is Guan Yu's mustache cover.</p>
<p>According to the novel, Emperor Xian of Han saw Guan Gong's extraordinarily long and beautiful beard and became very interested, asking questions. Guan Gong said that he often hung a long bag on his chest every night when he slept, putting his beard inside for protection.</p>
<p>I often wondered at the time what this kind of beard bag looked like - if it was too wide, it would not be able to protect the beard, and if it was too small, it would not be convenient to put the beard in. However, I always felt that the matter itself was very interesting.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, forty-five years ago (1904), an American probably heard someone talk about Romance of the Three Kingdoms and plagiarized Guan Gong's old article, actually claiming it as his own, saying that he had newly invented a "mustache cover" and specially registered it with the U.S. agency specializing in registering new inventions and handling patents (Patent Office) - unfortunately, no one has appreciated it to this day, and his invention has finally failed.</p>
<h3>A Discussion of Meditation Experiences (4)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>A Scientific Explanation of Meditation</p>
<p>Meditation was originally the so-called "inner work" of ancient Chinese Taoism. Can it be explained using modern scientific terms? I say it can. Of course, my scientific knowledge is extremely shallow, and I may not be able to truly explain the reasoning, but it doesn't hurt to say a few words in a simple way.</p>
<p>The human body originally has two types of nervous systems, one is the animal nervous system, and the other is the autonomic nervous system. The animal nervous system controls human perception and movement, while the autonomic nervous system is distributed in the internal organs and blood vessels and is connected to the animal system, so it is also called the sympathetic nervous system. The nerve center of the animal system is the brain. If the brain is overused, it will definitely feel tired. If you want to relieve the fatigue, you must rest. In the eyes of ordinary people, the way to rest is, of course, to sleep. If you don't use sleep, there is another special method that can allow the brain nerve center and all the organs to get rest, and it is true rest (because there are still dreams when you sleep, so it can't be considered true rest). If this kind of rest can be had once a day, for fifty minutes to an hour each time, thinking about it, it will definitely greatly help restore and improve human health. This can be determined by common sense. The meditation method eliminates thoughts, making all thoughts empty, temporarily making all nerves not have a single thought inside, and cutting off contact with things outside. Isn't this the best way to rest? However, simply resting and temporarily stopping nerve function is still passive. For example, if the political function of a country is to temporarily stop diplomatic work, it is possible, but it cannot fail to repair internal affairs. And if internal affairs are truly repaired well, then it will definitely be particularly smooth and beneficial in the future when dealing with diplomacy. The so-called repairing internal affairs is the abdominal movement of deep and fine breathing.</p>
<p>Originally, the nerves of the abdominal viscera belong to the autonomic nervous system. It usually has very little direct contact with the outside world, but it has a close relationship with the brain nerves and is distributed in various blood vessels. Let's use the national political institutions as an analogy: its role in the human body is like the country's transportation and transportation, and of course, the relationship with all domestic politics is extremely important. To repair internal affairs, there is no doubt that the entire transportation and transportation system should be sorted out to be very sound and very flexible. In the human body, there is a so-called visceral arterial plexus (Plexus coeliacuss colore) in the abdomen and a so-called hypogastric plexus (Plekus bypoqostvicus) in the pelvic region. The distribution of its sympathetic nerves is the most and the densest, and it can be said to be the most important transportation and transportation hub in the human body. However, people usually spend very little effort on sorting out and exercising it. That is no different from the country repairing internal affairs, failing to pay much attention to the transportation and transportation agencies, which is certainly not right. We practice gymnastics and engage in various fitness exercises, which is naturally very important, but what it exercises is still the external skin, muscles, and bones, with very little direct impact on the internal organs. It can be seen that this kind of effort to repair internal affairs seems to be not enough. If there is another special method that can constantly stimulate and exercise the sympathetic nerves, so that their function is enhanced and their vitality is strengthened, and naturally can promote the entire metabolism and increase the overall life force, then using deep and fine breathing to carry out abdominal visceral movement is to complete this function. It can be said that the effort of practicing gymnastics and engaging in various sports is "external smelting," so it can be called "external work," while this kind of abdominal visceral movement is "internal development," so China has called it "internal work" since ancient times. Naturally, external work is also extremely important and extremely valuable. It not only has the function of fitness but also has the effects of moral education, group education, and aesthetic education included incidentally. However, "external work" is already well known to the general public, while "internal work" is a very ancient method, and is often not valued or believed by people. That is why, after my own experience, I still do not mind using more words and forgetting my shallow knowledge to specially prove it with crude scientific terms. Of course, there are many incomplete places in what I have said, and there may even be some wrong places. I sincerely hope that scientific experts will teach me.</p>
