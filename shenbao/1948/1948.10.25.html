<h3>總統宴平各院校長教授　徵詢對經濟意見　翁文灝今日可能飛返京</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕蔣總統廿四日晚八時在行邸宴翁院長文灝，張副院長厲生及平各院·校長教授·胡適·陳垣·梅貽琦·陸志葦·袁敦禮·趙逎搏·蔣碩傑·周作仁·陳岱蓀·吳景超·劉大中·戴四光·趙守愚·賀麟·朱光渭等曾就目前經濟問題詢問各學者意見，以備採擇。</p>

<h3>臺灣光復三週年</h3>
<p>今天是臺灣光復節三週年紀念日，臺省博覽會亦定本日揭幕。臺北冠董雲集，慶祝此一盛典。在三年前的今天，臺灣舉行受降大典，日本總督安藤利吉，當塲恭簽降書，並經陳儀長官廣播宣吿中外，至是淪陷五十一年的臺灣，重見光明，返歸祖國。今天　灣省各界舉行盛大祝典，中央要員曁工程師年會出席人員，均蒞臺參加，熱烈空前。吾人謹以無限威奮之誠，祝臺省同胞之幸福，臺省建設之成功，並預祝臺灣前途隨光復的光輝而發揚光大！</p>
<p>臺灣為我國位於東海與南海之間的一省，著名島嶼有三部：臺灣本島·澎湖列島，及新南軍島，合而稱之曰臺灣省，形似芭蕉葉。其地東瞰太平洋，西望福建省，東北接琉球軍島，南與菲律賓相對，形勢險要，物產豐隆。土地面積有三萬五千九百六十一方公里，人口約六百六十餘萬人。主要方言屬閩南語系，居民之祖先墳墓，多在閩粵之漳泉潮惠各州，風俗習慣以及各地農村生活形態，全係國粵兩省權型。</p>
<p>由於臺灣形勝之重要，故在歷史上時遭外族侵擾·明萬曆卅二年（公元一六〇四），先有有蘭人入據澎湖，旋卽佔據臺灣本島，從事開發，大肆榨取；這是臺灣第一次遭遇外患。天啟六年（一六二六）有西班牙人侵臺；淸道光廿一年（一八四一）有英人的覬覦行動；光緒九年（一八八三）又有法軍窺臺。雖然這多次侵略都被粉粹，但已暗示臺灣在帝國主義的爭逐中，早已捲入了世界政治的漩渦。日本垂涎臺灣，起自明代中葉，實際上據有臺灣，則在佔領琉球（光緒元年公元一八七五）之後。甲午戰後，馬　條約（光緒廿一年公元一八九五）始正式將臺灣割讓日本，被獨占統治五十一年。當臺灣為列强爭逐時期，中國曾努力恢復統治權。例如；荷蘭人入主臺灣後，鄭成功曾光復之，成功之子鄭經治臺凡廿三年。鄭經死後，其子克墺始　送了廿三年的光榮歷史。其後繼續從事光復運動之臺人，有朱一貴，朱爽文等。馬關簽約，臺胞先烈邱逢甲宣佈獨立，組織民主國，宋　為日軍所敗、然民族正氣，彪炳史乘。故五十年以來，臺灣不甘屈服，反抗日寇，前仆後繼，血戰在百次以上。世界第二次大戰時，開羅會議宣言，昭示臺灣仍將屬我。勝利後，我國於民國卅四年十月廿五日接受日本總督降書，自此日起，全省版圖重返祖國，六百萬臺胞初見靑天白日，歡騰大地，熱望無涯。吾人今天慶祝臺灣光復，情景如在目前，是何等令人興奮的事。</p>
<p>吾人重視臺灣地理形勢，及臺胞奮鬥歷史之重要，愈益珍視臺灣光復意義的重大，自然對臺灣的政治和經濟建設，寄予了無限的希望。臺灣的政治，三年來似無多大進步，去歲「二二八」慘禍，實為臺灣最不愉快之事，至今回思，尤覺歉對臺胞。然而僕份憤事，决不等諸兄弟閱牆。吾人曾對臺胞寄以深厚同情，對地方政府之措施也曾表示異常惋惜。現在臺灣同胞對他省同胞關係，多良好圓滿，各縣市秩序亦極安定，足徵臺省不乏明達之士。今年三月，國大代表集會首都，臺灣國代曾提請中央明令規定臺灣為地方自治實施示範區，吾人深感臺灣自治條件具備，應助臺胞充分接受憲政精神，早日實施地方自治，俾納臺灣政治於正軌。關於臺灣經濟問題，可說是六百萬人的生計問題，關係綦重·臺灣昔日在日本統治下，祇有剝削和掠奪，人民多貧苦無吿，生活水準迫近飢餓，無所謂「充分就業」之說。三年以來，國內經濟不安的浪潮，襲擊着臺灣，使臺灣經濟建設發生波動，幸而臺省「在安定中求繁榮」之努力，尙能抗拒在浪，故臺灣還能够維持小康之局。如果政府能於經濟上，切實推動臺省建設，活潑臺省經濟，更於政治上推動地方自治，則臺灣必充滿光明的前程。此為吾人慶祝臺灣光復節之最大願望。</p>
<p>最後必須指出：吾人紀念臺灣光復節，深覺光復的意義可貴，希望臺灣地方政府和臺省同胞，珍視光復的歷史意義，努力團結，一心一德，共同創造，使臺灣成為中國最美麗的花園，而洗滌臺胞多年的苦難，早登幸福康樂之境。臺灣博覽會和全國工程師年會在此盛會期中先後揭幕，這是象徵幸福康樂　臺灣卽將到來。吾人謹祈臺灣同胞和各界人士努力創造，使光明燦爛的遠景早日來臨！</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕據廿四日探悉；在美國大選舉行以後，加拿大可望卽致力草擬與西方聯盟之防衛公約，該項條約將類似里亞熱內慮公約，並非束縛美國參戰，而規定在可能之戰爭措施中，必須互加磋商。一般希望在明年春季，北大西洋公約及承平時期軍事計劃均可完成。</p>

<h3>聯合國日　全市懸旗　各界舉行慶祝大會　殷切期望世界和平　市長致詞強調尚賴合作努力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲聯合國日，晨起全市一律懸旗慶祝。各界慶祝大會於上午九時假震旦大學禮堂舉行，出席吳國楨，潘公展，方治，李璜，李石曾夫婦，聯合國同志會張鈞海，及各機關團體代表數百人。會場四週懸全體會員國國旗，主席台上懸聯合國國旗及中美英法蘇五國國旗及「團結國際力量阻止侵略野心」，「發揚國際正義確保世界安全」等巨幅標語。大會開始，首由吳市長致詞，略謂：「人類全部歷史之演進，在把握理想，不斷進步，使理想卒成爲事實。聯合國之組織，在理想人類和平世界大同之極致，此一高大神聖目標，頃已深印吾人腦中，如何促其實現，則尚賴全世界人民合作努力。首次大戰後，曾產生國際聯盟，此次大戰後又產生聯合國，按之歷史，人類每逢大戰後，益覺和平之可貴，若干國際間之和平性聯盟，往往因此產生，足見人類實在不斷進步，目下之聯合國，較過去國際聯盟雖已進步，但組織尚達離吾人理想之健全，如聯合國並無國際警察以保障世界和平秩序，並無法限制會員國濫用否決權。吾人今日慶祝聯合國憲章成立三週年紀念，並非對目下之聯合國歌功頌德乃希望根據其高大神聖理想，不斷進步，促其實現，以達世界永久和平之一日」。</p>
<p>李璜報告當年憲章簽字情形</p>
<p>繼由我國出席聯合國代表李璜報告聯合國憲章討論經過及簽字情形。李氏稱：「聯合國憲章經二月之討論，會議往往自且至暮，工作極爲慎重。中國代表團十人，每人出席一小組委員會，同人間幷於每晨開會一次，共同檢討工作情形。憲章締定簽字時，儀式極爲隆重，我代表團經商討後決定在以五種文字同時公佈之憲章上，用中文簽署。代表團各代表中，王寵惠以法學專家立場，對憲章條文決不放鬆。顧維鈞·吳貽芳亦發言甚多，均有可貴貢獻。李氏最後并提出聯合國大會與第一次戰後若干國際會議，情形頗有不同，過去流行之秘密會商等外交手段，在聯合國大會中已被摒棄。各國代表間爭議雖烈，尚能以誠相見，坦白提出其本身要求，故締定之憲章，在原來理想外，并繼　顧事實。中委李石曾氏致詞時，強調其本人一貫主張之「社會化」原則。渠表示，聯合國組織，雖爲國際和平社會化表現，但社會化仍屬一部份，爲積極維持世界和平，必須使社會化擴大深入各階層，以合作力量，制止野心份子挑動國際戰爭。</p>
<p>潘公展表示須建立心理基礎</p>
<p>議長潘公展氏致詞稱：本市各界今慶祝聯合國日，實爲聯合國理想深入之表現，吾人爲保持聯合國憲章永久常存，必須建立心理基礎，蓋所有人類之偉大建設，均自一念出發。憲章開首稱：「我聯合國人民」而不分國界，實爲心理基礎之最好說明，吾人必須時時以「聯合國人民」爲觀念，人類和平，始能希望實現。吾人相信以聯合國全體人民之力量，協力弭戰，保障世界和平，決能成功，孟子謂：「天下懸乎定，定於一，不嗜殺人者能一之」，聯合國即爲「定於一」之具體表現，而世界和平，亦決非嗜殺之戰爭販子所得破壞也。</p>
<p>方治希望鞏固團結永保和平</p>
<p>國民黨上海市黨部主委方治氏致詞時，認爲保障世界和平，必須增強聯合國本身之力量，希望五十七會員國間，發揮「共信互信，共助互助」之合作精神，鞏固團結，確保永久和平。最後由聯合國遠東經濟社會理事會秘書長陸納賡森博士代表聯合國致詞，渠表示聯合國之理想在促進人類和平，以人民力量消弭戰禍，推進社會，經濟等建設，此項理想，爲吾人共同爭取之目標，相信發揚人類仁愛精神，加強團結，必可獲得成功。至十一時許散會。</p>

<p>其他慶祝紀念節目有：民航大隊飛機散發各國國旗及總統文告，公建電台廣播聯合國日特別節目，西藏路慕爾堂及貝當路美國教堂特別禮拜。下午四時至六時，聯合國駐滬辦事處假南昌路法國文化協會舉行雞尾酒會，到中外各界首長百餘人，賓主盡歡。</p>
<h3>火柴業供應減少　要求重訂廠盤價</h3>
<p>本市火柴廠業公會，以目前火柴原料缺乏，收購困難，且火柴之「八一九」限價，適該業銷路較稀廠盤價格低落之際，正欲調整之時，突受財經緊急處分令凍結，致生產供應，漸趨減少，而該業原料，如棉楊木及若干化學品之類，向來仰給於輸入限額者，又以外匯比率提高，使成本備受影響，該業公會爲此分函呈請社局及經管督導員辦公處，要求廠房實際成本重新核定各牌火柴廠盤價格，並附呈各項原料生產成本表請予核辦。</p>

<h3>海粵輪上青年失蹤　其父招尋忽接怪函</h3>
<p>被害抑自殺尚待偵查</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕青年張培賢，（見圖）字育德，廿三歲，河北磁縣人，本年六月十日乘海粵輪由津至滬，三月有餘，杳無音訊。其父張文林，現爲河南安陽地方法院書記官，追蹤來滬，寓浙江南路寶安坊十六號，在滬四出找尋，終無下落，曾於本月七日至十日登報招尋，其廣告稱：「張培賢，字育德，係河北磁縣（磁州）人，年二十三歲，於本年六月十日乘海粵輪由津至滬，三月有餘，永無音信，仁人君子，知其下落因而尋獲者，酬謝金圓一百圓，浙江南路寶安坊十六號張文林啓。」又附啓云：「培賢兒覺：父已到滬，一切本爾之意，絕不勉強，可來浙江南路寶安坊十六號一談，或來一信亦可，張文林啓。」該項廣告連登四天，仍音信杳然。至十五十六兩日，續登報兩天，距十七日晨張文林忽接一函，係永鋼筆繕寫，內容謂「培賢君業已被謀殺，希文林先生今天即往申報社查詢上海社鄧君住址，即可水落石出」云云。下署靜夫二字，並無地址。當時張文林接信後，猶豫不決，嗣來本館詢問，後疑上海社為上海通訊社，續至該社查詢，則並無鄧姓其人。遂折至黃浦警分局報告。經李股長加派警員李？明復至上海通訊社詳詢，亦無眉目，又來本館查詢姓鄧者，亦不得要領。記者昨日走訪張文林於其寓所，據謂，培賢由家赴津，在前年春間。緣勝利後原籍磁縣一帶不靖，不能居住，培賢隻身逃來滬上寓浙江南路寶安坊十六號豫慶公公寓中，約一週後乘輪赴津粬店街大樓胡同十四號內功泰雜貨莊營生，歷二年之久。去冬有同鄉人至津，告彼家鄉遭擾亂慘況，以及先祖父嬸母遇害之經過，培賢頓時呆如木雞，隔數日發病，曾臥牀半月，神經似有變態。旋忽失蹤，事後在各報懸賞，在電台廣播，並四出找尋，經尋獲後送入醫院療治，精神漸復常態。嗣後其叔星林獲悉斯情，特由漢口乘機赴津探視，並加安慰，其精神恢復如初。今夏五月夕，其叔星林由津來滬，被其所悉，曾徵求星林意見後，於六月五日搭招商局海粵輪來滬，詎該論於十日抵滬，而培賢即不知去向。是否蹈海自盡，或被人謀殺，終成一謎。張文林末稱，本人爲一公務員，不克分身，始於月初簽請給假一月，親來追究，瞬已兼句，而所得結果已如上述，實令人心酸。如能借貴報披露經過，得能珠還合浦，俾父子重圓，則感激無己云。</p>
<p>慶祝聯合國日舉行之雞尾酒會中外各界來賓</p>
<h3>國行撥紗萬件　分運各地易棉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國棉聯購處自成立以來，以普遍實施限價收花，故各地分處分站收花數量，極爲有限。據悉：各地棉價，普遍較限價高出一倍至一倍半，而棉紗成品價格，則更較限價普遍高出二倍至二倍半，故自本週起，收花時之價款，半數以棉紗折充，半數仍爲現鈔，當能克服限價收花之困難。聞中央銀行爲易棉花所撥出棉紗一萬件，即將由該處分運各地云。</p>

<h3>各界首長籌商　米煤來源問題　鼓勵商人　踴躍採購</h3>
<p>當局爲解決本市食米等各項物資來源問題，連日由吳市長，潘議長，方治，吳開先，楊綽庵等各機關首長，數度磋商，茲據潘議長談稱：目前上海最緊要而亟待解決之問題爲米及煤之來源，全市每月所需食米數量，除配給來外，尚需米商供應二十萬担，惟因最近產區價高，米商不願運滬，照限價售出，在此種情形之下，政府應設法如何鼓勵商人踴躍採購食米來滬。至於煤觔，因爲津浦路交通梗阻，中與煤不能運來，北方煤更因船隻缺乏，亦告斷檔，現祗靠淮南煤及台北煤，公用事業甚至已動員安全煤，本人在去年即主張能在產區儘量買到煤觔之時，應鼓勵煤商儘量採購儲存，惜當初主管機構並未顧及，故目前應速謀解決辦法，否則工業生產，亦將大受影響云。</p>
<h3>滬難民移墾江西　袁文彰在贛商洽</h3>

<p>一週經濟　中國工商協會主編　　　南京西　　　　　　　六六○</p>
<h3>一般物價　搶購現象表面比較靜止　各方面似均在伺機待變</h3>
<p>本週市場的狀況，承前週之後，並沒有什麼好轉，停市的仍舊停市，未做開的仍舊未做開，看趨勢好像在等待政府新的措施，未扭轉這個局面，在政府未有新措施前，短時內似尚不會有大的變化。搶購物資的現象比較靜止了，這是一方面由於商人把物資藏匿了，一方面由於憑身份證購買種種的限制，但我們絕不能認爲大家搶購物資的心理就巳息滅。金融市場在上週也逐漸有了新的反應，銀根趨緊，暗息頻頻高升，約站二角以上，客戶紛紛提現，行莊存款頓減，據估計九月底行莊存款總額約達二億五千萬元，目前存款總額，減至五千萬元左右。全國其他各大都市物價，均一致猛升，若干地方政府，爲顧及事實上的困難，對少數重要商品，已有將八一九限價，准予調整者。此外中樞當局曾令輸出入管理委員會，爲推廣輸出，爭取外匯起見，決定取消桐油限價，而在產地實行議價，至於讓價標准，則根據國外價格，減去各種費用，與合法利潤，以議定產地應售價格。連日當局對於物價問題，迭有重要會議召開，惟出席人員，對於會議內容，均　莫如深，限價的前途究竟如何，現尚在不可知之列！</p>
<p>至於當局對目前物價問題的看法及上漲原因的分析，我們可以借翁文　王雲五兩氏在立法院的報告作說明。翁文　氏稱目前之反常情形，係由四種因素所造成：（一）軍事關係對人心影響甚大，（二）共匪之破壞，（三）若干地區限價過低，（四）漩資作崇。王雲五氏的報告，將各地物價漲落的情形，分爲三個時期說明：（一）八一九以前之物價爲瘋狂上漲。（二）八一九至九月底，由於金圓劵的發行，一般物價穩定，甚且部份下落。（三）九月底開始波動，至十月間而波動更爲明顯，以致造成今日之現象。王氏認爲物價波動的原因甚多。如共匪之擾亂，軍事局勢之變化，物資供應一時失靈，人民心理不安等。最後王氏提出針對目前情況的補救辦法四點：（一）增加生產，（二）節約消費，（三）疏導物資，（四）控制游資。</p>
<p>在前述的四點之下，王氏爲彌補財政經濟緊急處分令之若干漏洞，以穩定當前的經濟局勢，進而擬訂一個整套的實施方案，據聯合　信所訊，該方案之內容包括下列部份：（一）緊縮金圓劵之發行，並設法使其回籠。（二）善爲利用所收兌之金融外匯。（三）合理調整物價，但仍嚴格執行限價政策。（四）國營交通公用事業價格恢復戰前標凖，政府停止貼補。（五）改善公敎人員待遇。（六）吸收游資。（七）擴大配給及憑證配售。（八）控制物價，調節產區與市場之供需。（九）加強全面經濟管制，並澈底取締黑市存在。（十）取締走私及資金南流。（十）（一）開放貸款，加強生產等。</p>
<p>這個尚在擬定中的王氏新方案，包括內容很廣，我們姑就這幾條綱領看，它內在的困難和自相矛盾之處理是在所難免。</p>
<p>本市方面，自搶購星期發生，市上物資供應短缺後，當局對於推行定量分配制度，益見積極，現決定實施戶口經濟查將發給新國民身份證，并附發配購證一百四十四張，每月可買米，油，煤球，糖等約十二種，一年買完。配購證每張印有號碼，准購貨物名稱，將來隨時發表，以何號於何時購何物。至對象方面，聞公敎人員爲配給，市民爲配購。物資的數量，規定米每月配給一斗，油每月配給一斤，糖每月配給半斤，煤球每月配給二担，布每六個月配給一丈五尺。我們知道定量分配制度是實施節約最有效的辦法，這辦法尤以英國行之最著成績。不過它也有若干先決條件，應當加以解決的，如大量物資的控制及源源供應；配給物資價格的決定，對於生產成本及消費者的負擔必須兼顧；社會組織的嚴密，戶口調查的詳　；辦事人員的高度工作效率等等。實施定量分配制度是一個艱鉅的工作，假設這一次能辦得好，那是使國家向現代化的路上大跨了一步。</p>
<p>上週滬區經管當局爲加強物資調節供應，邀集蘇浙皖京滬三省兩市代表在滬舉行擴大會議，商討三省兩市物資交流辦法，經討論結果，瀘市方面允將布，紗，糖，皂及火榮分運各省。蘇省允供滬市者爲棉花，米及小麥，浙省允供麻與桐油，皖省允供食米及　菜副產品。</p>
<p>工商動態</p>
<h3>好事多磨的　擴大原料供應問題</h3>
<p>上週本市工商界原料與燃料恐慌，仍無顯著減輕之跡象。就煤斤一項而論，據估計京滬兩區月需共卅五萬噸，冬季因熱量關係，需要量增加一倍，但目前各供應產區的產量，充其量每月爲廿一萬四千噸，再加上戰區擴大，交通阻梗，自然在運輸上更發生問題了。原料燃料恐慌一日無順利的解救，工商業生產的减縮也一日無止境。</p>
<p>爲積極推行調節物資供應的工作，上海區物質調節委員會於上周二舉行會議，並決定儘速成立工業原料燃料及日用必需品等三小組，俾使推進各項業務。</p>
<p>本來，要解除原料燃料的恐慌，不外有幾個途徑，第一爲積極向國內各有關產區採購，例如對於原棉的採購，國棉聯購處已於本月十六日在全國各地分支機構。全面展開收購工作。但據悉此項工作。由於限價關係，頗難進展。於是國棉聯購處只能採取搭配紗布至棉區作價交換的方法，以解決限價下收購的困難。同時，爲維持聯購政策以避免競購起見，該處又呈請行政院通令產棉區省政府，請嚴禁各紗廠單獨以紗易花等辦法，從事收購。這可以說是維持一種托辣斯的組織，所謂「搭配紗布作價交換」，假如其「作價」仍遠在原棉的再生產成本以下，那未就長期來說，顯然是損傷原棉的生產力的，這一點當局不能不注意到。此外，原棉的收購工作困難仍多，據華東社報導，據悉在國棉的收購聲中，關於已收得棉花之運輸問題，至今仍無法澈底解決，這確是採購工作的致命傷，顯而易見，戰事愈擴大，運輸愈有問題，可見原棉的供應亦決不是單純解決經濟問題就能擴展的。</p>
<p>第二種解除原料燃料恐慌的方法，是擴大國外的輸入。例如最近經政院公佈的已付貨款物資的開放辦法卽爲具體的步驟之一，據估計，此項辦法如能生效，則留存香港達五千萬美金價值的物資，可以進口，對解救原料的恐慌，不無裨益，不過另據金融界方面消息，遺存香港的自備外匯物資，其能否進口，端視國內金融情況是否益趨平稱爲定，顯然，假如進口的原料，必須當被限價收購的風險，那末所謂部份開放自備外廠的　力仍是不太大的。至於燃料的擴大輸入，似乎當局也在設法，據本市公用局長報告，市財政當局已商得中央銀行同意，託中央信託局訂購國外煤斤五萬噸，以解決多季公用事業用煤問題，但這一辦法決不能看作政府已作貼補公用事業的凖備，因爲上週三物資調節委會工業小組開會的時候，央行列席代表，對於輸入工業原料所需外匯一點，卽表示當局缺乏外匯，故督導處擬撥外匯二千萬美元，由中信局輸入原料一節，「央行尚未奉到命令」云云，可見假如認爲政府最近收入金銀外匯甚多，故可以移用於原料物資的輸入，顯然是太天真的一種想法。</p>
<p>第三種解除原料燃料恐慌的方法，只有要工商界「自力更生」了，「羊毛出在羊身上」，這也是最輕而易舉的辦法，因此上週四物資調節委會工業小組會議的結果，卽決定橡膠及造紙等所需原料，應根據本市各行商號所報貨品數量，優先供應橡膠造紙業。依此類推，特別是稍有加工的原料，大槪政府將大規模採用「得之左手，去之右手」的辦法，擔當一下各業的「介紹人」，但是問題仍未澈底解決，僅僅靠這個辦法來應付原燃料的恐慌，恐慌仍舊要來的。在無可奈何的局勢下，節約運動就必然要被提出了，例如就燃煤一項而論，據大公社訊，當局正擬實施多令節煤運動，請市民對取暖用煤加以節制，並對大樓辦公室，公共場所，舞廳，戲院等，禁止施用熱水汀；自然，與星期二不准肉食一樣，這不過是一個開始，冬天—一個不平凡的冬天，看來五百多萬市民都要咬緊牙關去忍受飢寒交迫的磨折哩！</p>

<h3>大餅及其他</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>因為節約，而且又限於經濟，大餅油條便成為我每天的主要早餐。但今早照例去買時，買不到。問理由，回答是：麵粉無着，無法製造。看情形，那餅攤老闆並不像說謊，便只好怏怏的打回票。</p>
<p>正因為有點怏怏，所以想到的都是不愉快的事；又因為這怏怏的所以發生，是沒有買到大餅，所以又聯想到前幾天偶然看到的一則某餅攤主人因無法購買麵粉，無法營業，又因妻病憤而自殺的新聞。（姓名地點已忘記，因為那時自己還有大餅可啃，所以頗「等閒視之」；好在是無關宏旨。）</p>
<p>這新聞當然只是頂小的標題，排印在報紙的角落里，注意看的人自然不多，看到的也不會當他一回事。但現在却因和本身有點關切了，不僅沒有當時看報時的飄飄然之感，更認為這問題有點嚴重，雖說這一問題的所以嚴重還是自己的感覺。</p>
<p>其實，從遠處大處看，這何嘗不是嚴重的社會問題！</p>
<p>某餅攤老闆的自殺，其動機固由於「妻又患病」。但「又」字是緊接着「無法營業」的上文的。因此，如果麵粉「有」着，「有」法營業，則「其妻」雖病，某老闆決不致於自殺，顯而易見。據此，則某老闆的自殺，當然是為了無法營業。</p>
<p>無法營業，也就等於失業。大餅攤的無法營業，因為範圍小，而且也不一定用伙計，失業的大概僅老闆一人，受影響的只不過如筆者一類的啃大餅的人們。因而想哼一句「民亦勞止」來發洩一點牢騷，想也是當然的。</p>
<p>可是，如果無法營業的範圍萬一擴大，則問題倒不如此簡單了。冷眼旁觀，這一傾向却似乎並非絕無實現的可能。</p>
<p>現在本市大大小小的商店，真可說得上門庭若市，但所陳列的貨物不只是寥寥無幾嗎？搶購固然是形成這景象的一個原因，但他總懷疑除搶購之外，還有人在搶藏。搶購的是顧客，搶藏的則是老闆，而後者則比前者搶得更兇。由於雙「搶」同進，於是許多商店便都變成張開大口的怪物了。</p>
<p>例如香烟，在加稅前是到處缺貨的，價格一經調整，貨物馬上便又「湧到」，求無不應；但最近幾天，又是到處缺貨。當局調查的結果，不是廠家與批發商在互相推諉嗎？舉一反三，我懷疑許多商品都有人在設法來「無法營業」。</p>
<p>如果這樣的「無法營業」一經擴大，則將來大發其「無法財」（因為我們過去有國難財和勝利財，現在不妨杜撰「無法財」這一名稱，湊成鼎立之勢，倒也頗覺堂皇）的自大有其人。不過這「大有其人」只是少數的人。大多數的薪水階級恐怕將由少數老闆的假裝無法營業，進而變為不願營業，再進一步而來一個關門大吉而失業；這一來，便沒有大餅攤的無法營業的簡單了。</p>
<p>如果將來真不幸而增加了這一大批的失業羣，怎麼辦？</p>
<p>因為一天沒有啃到大餅而說出上述一大堆廢話，不免使樂天派的逍遙份子目為「歇斯底里」，我也極願意這確是自己的「歇斯底里」。因為單是自己的「歇斯底里」，則感覺恐慌的只不過自己個人。杞人憂天，憂死了還不是自作自受！</p>
<p>語云：星星之火，可以燎原。我盼望大餅攤的無法營業只是極短時期的一點偶然的泡沫，不但說不上星星之火，而且根本不是火。</p>
<h3>排隊</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>我生平曾經受過一次嚴重的排隊的考驗，那是在敵偽時代乘火車回鄉的時候。其時買一張車票，須要挽托熟人，出以高出於票價若干倍的價目，才可以弄到手。當然你拿了這張車票，想踏上火車，在經過軋票處的關口，這非得排隊不可。那時冒了十二月的寒風，大清早趕到車站，早已看見一隊長蛇陣排得如銅踏鐵壁一般，我擠在人叢最後列，不消五分鍾，回頭看看，又是一大堆人擠在我的背後了。</p>
<p>這時軋票處還沒有開始工作，長蛇陣愈擠愈緊，推着，擁着，幾乎連呼吸都難以舒暢。其間還雜着巡警的吆喝。藤鞭在空中揮動的威脅聲—確乎很難受。等到我軋過票，衝出這小小的軋票處罅口時，居然在寒風中擠出一身大汗，從內衣汗濕到棉襖，滿頭汗珠，幾如盛夏相等。生平所吃排隊的苦頭，以那一次印象最深刻，永遠不會忘記；對於排隊的痛恨，也在那一次開始種下了根，—因為這不像排隊，簡直是生死搏鬥。</p>
<p>其實對於排隊一件事，原是無可厚非。為了要使擁擠的人羣，維持秩序，除了排隊沒有別的方法。只是今日世亂荒荒，排隊成為一種事態惡劣化的象徵。譬如說我們先前拿戶口米，憑票配給，儘可從從容容在規定的有效日期中去領購，但降至近日，米店裏無米應市，戶口米也要用搶購的方式去獲得，於是勢非排隊不可了。</p>
<p>米解決了之後，菜蔬也要排隊，買肉，買魚……只要是屬於葷腥的東西，就得排隊，主婦們為了解決一天的伙食，就非得排隊不可，真是一粥一飯，當思來處不易了。等而下之，連購買珠寶獎券也要排隊，也要搶購，亦可見今日人民的生活，是怎樣的處於徬徨之境！</p>
<p>排隊既是無可厚非，我們不得不在其中加以選擇，何必隨波逐流，跟了一般人到處作排隊的生涯？例如家無擔石之儲的，為戶口米而排隊是必要的，但魚肉不吃，尚有蔬菜，何必為了一斤肉，一條魚而從黎明一直守候到日哺？珠寶獎券的頭獎誠屬令人艷羨，但是想到了六十萬份之一的機會，不惜排隊而去買一張獎券，就覺得是生命力的浪費了。我想這種議論不致影響到獎券的推銷，因為到我執筆時為止，聽說獎券已經全部售罄了。</p>
<p>我情愿費了無謂的排隊的氣力來作一次運動，因為有許多排隊的結果是徒然的。有一次我親眼看見一對情侶或夫婦到影院去排隊買戲票，輪到他們將要達到窗口的時候，已經掛出「票已售罄，明日請早」的牌子，這對情侶或夫婦只得廢然而返。你看這種排隊掃興不？</p>
<h3>說酒</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>政府為增加奢侈品稅起見，首先增加香烟及酒稅百分之七十以上，因之香烟及酒，准其漲價至一倍多，打破八一九固定價格。香菸及酒，皆具激刺性，而且含有微毒，然世人癖好者多，不知不覺入其彀中，不能自拔。香烟不具論，至於酒，古人所謂「掃愁帶」「釣詩鈎」，一般人以酒為「掃愁帶」，文人則以酒為「釣詩鈎」，李太白斗酒詩百篇，即是「釣詩鈎」的詩人代表。</p>
<p>天氣漸漸冷下去，酒又漸漸抬頭，酒價雖增至一倍，耽飲者絕對不覺得。我的左近有一家酒鋪，什麼玫瑰燒，五茄皮，葡萄酪，佛手燒，楊梅燒，老枯之外有新枯，花雕之外有太雕，并且還有各種外國酒，黑色瓶上，粘有花花綠綠的廣告紙，陳列在玻璃櫥內，煞是好看。有許多酒人走過，免不了垂涎三尺，假如身邊有錢，就在櫃檯上，倒了一杯，站着斟酌起來，一杯盡後，再來一杯，儘他面紅耳赤，心中飄飄蕩蕩，什麼國家，什麼世界，好像與他全無關係。即使走出來，倒在馬路旁邊，也無所謂，反正就地埋我，古人也有成例的，依例照做一番，有何不可。還說這種時代，活着也無大味，我們又不能貪污，發財無路，一生廉潔，也無人稱讚，醉生夢死，醉死夢生，都是一般的。做這種　　的人，我倒常常見着，當他酒酣耳熟的時候，就走過去與他談談，外國人也有，中國人也有，外國話我却不懂，中國人如若上了年紀，多半有一種閱歷與沉痛悲哀，發掘起來，倒也着實有些感慨淋漓。</p>
<p>因之他是借酒作「掃愁　」，我倒不免借那酒人的話，作了我的「釣詩鈎」。我友木居士說：「半是詩狂半酒狂，一回歌詠一飛觴，消寒避暑皆如意，沈醉高吟有別腸。」又說：「有時有酒終非計，有酒無詩也不聊，詩出性情乘醉寫，酒逢　　倚聲澆。」我說：「千古誰知李白狂，百篇斗酒擁壺觴，將詩下酒詩添味，偕酒談詩酒潤腸。杜牧登樓醺更酌，陶潛策杖醉相忘。由他地覆天翻去，一　奇文滿錦囊。」畢竟有些酸溜溜的，就此擱筆。</p>
<h3>話楓橋</h3>
<p>— 侯細</p>
<p>許多名勝，從流傳的文字上給我們的印象，比實地風光還可愛得多。往往身歷其境，才覺到並非什麼可取，常不免暗怪前人太會用文詞，渲染得那麼出色。像「姑蘇城外寒山寺」，從唐人張繼的那首楓橋夜泊詩裏傳達給我們的光景是如何幽美！慕名前往的大不乏人，而十九認為不值一游，只落得一幅張繼詩碑的拓片而歸。</p>
<p>其實，張繼的詩題是「楓橋夜泊」，描寫周遭的景物，透露內在的情緒，並非題寒山寺的。當月已落，鳥正啼，霜氣滿天，對着楓林漁火，含愁不寐，寺鍾到枕，悄然成吟，羁旅之感，滲透詩骨，只用「愁眠」二字點醒全篇。小時曾見什麼書上解「愁眠」為石名，最為奇突。又有人指摘夜半無鍾聲，別人又出來舉例反駁，也覺得很無味。</p>
<p>一個詩人捉着一時一境的興感，完成一首創作，我們從各個不同的角度去領會，悟解，只求相去不遠，又何用再穿　附會！張繼詩中表現的情景意境，以及詩的音節色澤，都能給我們一種感染。因這詩而嚮往寒山寺，也算是欣賞者的會心。至失望而返，那就怪自家太過拘泥，不能錯怪唐人已在替寒山寺和尚做招攬遊客的廣告詩了。而且浮光掠影地去進廟訪碑，固得不到什麼佳境，即使雇一隻船，撐到楓橋過夜，眼前雖正值霜天時候，怕也未必能實踐詩境，結果贏得通宵失眠，倒是極可能的。</p>
<p>記得十五年的秋天，有事從水路赴蘇，舟過楓橋，推篷一望，荒榛蔓草，殘陽亂鴉，水次生愁，橋陰無語。曾特地上岸看了看寒山寺，聊舒困悶，却沒有做詩，大約「崔顥題詩在上頭」的壓迫之感也不無關係。及至定居蘇州，數度出　門，過楓橋，往天平山去，也順道寒山寺息脚；遊人入寺，並不為聽鐘，却都是來看鐘的。但是唐代古鐘早被弄往日本，目前尚在搜訪下落哩。</p>
<p>小杜詩有云：「惟有別時今不忘，暮烟秋雨過楓橋。」這又是一位唐人筆下的楓橋。後來人題詠的頗多，似乎下筆太經意了，反少可觀。</p>
<p>楓橋自有它的幽美，且莫抱着「月落烏啼霜滿天」的「成竹」去驗收詩料就好。所以我有時還想着楓橋，可惜沒有在橋邊夜泊，那年路過，當晚就趕到橫塘。但又何必一定夜泊呢，我疑心自己也犯了「刻舟求劍」的毛病了。</p>
<p>叔範屬題黃晦木先生澄泥硯　姚　雛</p>
<p>汾流　　萬钧力，撞折　牙割蛟脊，獨留一片　魚黃，來配先生水坑赤。書生蹈義起倉卒，　婦園僮爭赴敵，白雲莊外沸繁紛，九死餘生尚腰笛。自來忠義本情性，慷慨從容原一脉，大洲拜疏星窺牖，　羽招魂竹裂石，想見道嚴結寨時，刳肝為紙血為壘，晚貯　淚寫殘山，誰識軍前曾草檄？明亡及今三百載，　　幽光終不熄，亦如囊絹出澄泥，浪汨沙埋不可蝕；太行萬疊與同體，鎮覆四方真有德，策　倘許過管城，戊已將軍號堪錫·三吳當日奮魁傑，窮走幽并悲秀麥，栖栖一代將母同，古貌惟傳瞳子白。欲將遺物傲餘姚，試向茜墩尋故鳥。（崑山茜墩亭林先生故居遺履猶存）</p>
<h3>說菊</h3>
<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>儘管菊花為雅人文士所樂道，而一般自認為隱逸之流的人物，也恒以採菊賞菊而自鳴清高，其實現今城市中的菊花盆景兒，早經人們的擺弄，而失去偕人隱居的故態了。</p>
<p>真正陪野人山居的菊花乃是山野間的黃花野菊之類，它們的花形小而簡單，品種不一，通常能由夏末開花到冬末，從平地分佈到高山，從溫帶分佈到寒帶，不但不怕風霜，而且能耐冰雪，甚至有些倔強的種類能棲居乾燥異常的荒崖或沙漠中，忍耐氣候的差異，而隨時掙扎起來，表現出它的韌力。這方才是我們理想中的黃花，也方能代表在黑暗社會中不聲不嚮埋頭苦幹的君子們。拿這些不大出名的菊科族類來加以表揚，方才合乎今日賞菊之道。也只有那些無名的黃花才是真正的點綴了秋天的原野，使大地增加了美麗，使大衆們有了秋的感覺。</p>
<p>此外也不禁連想到那田圃中經專家們培植的除虫菊。他們雖有菊名，但並非徒供清賞，而且有除虫之效。這恰恰像似那黑暗時期中努力抨擊逆流掃除羣醜的烈士君子，他們之被專家重視，也如同歷代的君子被歷史家重視一樣。也多虧有他這一類，特具防除害虫的魄力，才在無形中為整個生物界減少了不少的損害，因而對於他不但值得「賞」，而且值得重視，值得加以培植。特此提出這和正人君子相配的除虫菊，以和賞菊家們商榷，不知今後能對他加以品評否？</p>

        <h1>1948.10.25</h1>
<h3>Victory on Both Sides of Southern and Western Liaoning: Yingkou and Heishan Recovered Simultaneously; Final Battle Deployment Completed in the Jinzhou-Huludao Area</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 24th] The Li Yuzhang Corps of the Southern Liaoning Assault Force, after capturing Haicheng on the 23rd, recaptured Dashiqiao and Yingkou Port within 24 hours on the 24th, opening up the Shenyang-Yingkou railway. The reopening of the port has significant implications. The Liu Corps marched in under the cover of night on the 23rd, and at 6:00 AM on the 24th, they first seized Dashiqiao, the connection point between Yingkou and Dalian. The search troops then advanced towards Yingkou. After a fierce battle, Yingkou was declared recovered at 9:00 AM. Yingkou fell on February 26th of this year when Wang Jiashan, the commander of the newly formed defending troops, surrendered to the bandits. The city was under bandit control for eight months less two days. The bandit's Third Independent Division and the Fifth Military Sub-district, totaling about three regiments, along with the Yangtze River troops and the Gaiping Security Regiment, numbered about five to six thousand men. After four or five attacks by the Liu Corps, they suffered heavy losses, and the remnants fled towards Niuzhuang and areas east of Anshan. After the complete defeat of the bandits in Southern Liaoning, the damage to the China Changchun Railway and the section between Dashiqiao and Yingkou was not severe. The China Changchun Railway authorities are expected to be able to quickly repair it. The port of Yingkou has about one and a half months left in the shipping season. If the opportunity can be seized, there is much that can be accomplished. At dawn on the 24th, two naval vessels arrived off the coast of Yingkou to support the attacking forces. After the bandits retreated, troops landed. More ships are expected to arrive, which will greatly contribute to the next major battle in Western Liaoning.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 24th] The Shenyang Western Advancement Corps arrayed outside Heishan and Dahu Mountain. The bandits in Dahu Mountain, Hanbangzi, Luyangyi, and Beizhen mostly fled westward. The National Army entered Heishan city on the morning of the 24th. Other units are attempting to capture the main force of the bandits. A major battle is brewing in the Jinzhou-Huludao area. Both sides have completed their deployments, and a battle is imminent. The bandits are using a portion of their forces to move towards Suizhong, possibly attempting to control the transportation inside and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass and to block the National Army from entering Manchuria. The National Army has deployed in a pincer formation for the decisive battle between Jinzhou and Huludao, and the bandits will be attacked from both sides. The recovery of Yingkou further strengthens this force, which shows the government's determination towards the Northeast. Currently, warships and transport ships are continuously moving on the Liaodong Bay.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] Our Southern Liaoning Corps captured Dashiqiao at 6:00 AM on the 24th and then recaptured Yingkou, the maritime gateway to the Northeast, at 9:00 AM. The good news has greatly excited the million residents here. The Liaoning Provincial Government has announced Liao Chuangui as the Mayor of Yingkou. Liao has already entered the urban area with the troops on the morning of the 24th and is carrying out relief work for the returning refugees.</p>
<h3>Another Brilliant Victory in Northern Chahar; New Sweep Begins in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced: (1) The Chahar North Sweep Force achieved another brilliant victory on the west bank of the Danqing River. On the night of the 22nd, the force completely annihilated Wu Guangyi's 13th Brigade of over 1,500 bandits near Dashinao. (2) Scattered bandits who fled northeast of Xiaoying in Pinggu County and southwest of Shixia were routed by the National Army on the 23rd and fled to the western mountainous area of the Heng River.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 24th] It is reported that the victory in Eastern Chahar will promote the development of the Hebei war situation. The Pingbao Line may be reopened in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Military News: (1) A new sweep has begun in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. Strong forces have crossed Zhuoxian County, recovered Songlindian, and are advancing in separate routes towards Xincheng and Gaobeidian. It is reported that they have controlled the above two locations. (2) The National Army sweeping Northern Ping recovered Gaoliying.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 24th] The large-scale annihilation battle of the remnants of the bandits fleeing to the mountainous areas of Eastern Chahar is about to begin. On the morning of the 24th, the National Army surrounded the bandit's columns in the areas of Nanchadao in the south of Zhuolu and Taipingbao in the south of Panshanbao. The battle is still fiercely underway. Furthermore, the annihilation battle in Dukoubao east of the Xiyang River in Western Chahar ended on the 24th. The bandit corpses were scattered everywhere, and the remnants fled eastward.</p>
<h3>Bandits Retreat from the Outskirts of Gui Sui; Major Battle Brewing on the Plain Between Sui and Baotou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guisui, 24th] The Suiyuan National Army has been continuously searching for scattered bandits in the suburbs for days. Under the pressure of our elite troops, the bandits have been retreating across the board since the 23rd. According to military news, the bandits harassing the outskirts of Suiyuan, including Hun Jinqiao, Taohua Slope, and Banting Camp, retreated towards the Helin mountainous area on the 23rd. The bandits at Taobuqi Baitat on the railway line fled towards Xigoumen. The National Army is in pursuit. The bandits who invaded Tuosa are still wandering within the territory, looting civilian food. The National Army's elite cavalry and local militias are encircling and suppressing them.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] A major battle is brewing on the Sui-Baotou Plain. An aerial reconnaissance report on the morning of the 24th indicated that a portion of the bandit army attacking Baotou has begun to retreat eastward, seemingly to increase the pressure on Guisui. The National Army's Sun Lanfeng Corps is also rushing to Guisui for reinforcement. The bandit army outside Guisui is constructing fortifications in the area of the Dahei River. Military authorities have stated that if the Nie bandits linger in the Sui-Baotou area and do not retreat, it will provide an opportunity for the National Army to fight an annihilation battle. The speaker pointed out that the Communist bandits are far from their base areas, and the Sui-Baotou area is a simple plain with very few villages and trees, making it extremely unfavorable for the Communist bandits to fight.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Regarding the withdrawal from Baotou, it is learned here that the garrison troops in Baotou also safely withdrew to the mountainous area 30 to 40 li northwest, waiting for an opportunity to fight the bandits. Deng Baoshan and Feng Qinzhai reported the withdrawal situation to the military authorities in Beiping from their new post on the 23rd. It is reported that the order to withdraw from Baotou was issued by a certain place at 4:00 AM on the 23rd. The headquarters and troops began to withdraw at dawn, and merchants also left Baotou with the army. The forces attacking Baotou were the bandit's 1st and 8th Columns, with a cavalry unit, totaling over 20,000 men. After capturing Tuoxian County, they moved upstream along the Yellow River and briefly engaged with the National Army militia near Dengkou. The highest military authorities in North China made the decision to withdraw due to the small number of garrison troops in Baotou.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced: A major battle outside Guisui has not yet occurred. The bandits who fled to Taohua Slope south of Guisui and the Zhao Jun Tomb seem to be constructing fortifications. The bandits who fled to Taigemu, Chasu Cha, and Maidamin west of Guisui have partially damaged the railway and telegraph lines. Another report: A unit of the National Army's mobile suppression force captured the bandit's Guisui County Magistrate and 47 district chiefs and lower-level officials in Xixiaojia, 50 li north of Helin, on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>The Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Political Committee to Hold its First Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Political Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Xuzhou on the 25th. More than half of the committee members have arrived in Xuzhou. Chairman Ding Zhipan of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Director Zhao Zili of the Yudu East Administrative Office of the Henan Provincial Government, and Acting Director Wang Pingyi of the Xuzhou Office of the Shandong Provincial Government have also come to Xuzhou to participate.</p>
<h3>Shi Jue Returns to Chengde from Beiping; National Army Smoothly Conducts Mobile Suppression Operations to Protect Mines at Damiao</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chengde, 23rd] Commander Shi Jue flew to Beiping on a special plane on the 20th upon the summons of the President and returned to Chengde at 3:00 PM on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chengde, 24th] The National Army units protecting the mines at Damiao have made smooth progress in their mobile suppression operations in recent days. Today, they defeated the 18th and 19th bandit regiments, totaling about 700 men, who were lurking and harassing the area, killing over 100. The remnants of the bandits fled north. The National Army pursuit units have crossed Longhua.</p>
<h3>New Deployment Completed in Northern Henan; Bandit Troops Reach the Outskirts of Xinxiang and Engagement Has Occurred; National Army in Northern Jiangsu Recaptures Zhangdian and Xin'an</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] The National Army, which shifted its offensive direction from Zhengzhou, has now completed a new deployment in Northern Henan and is operating on the north bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 24th] The 14th Bandit Column in Northern Henan reached the outskirts of Xinxiang on the 24th. Its 36th Division fled to Xiaoji Town in the southwest and is currently engaged with the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 24th] The war in Northern Jiangsu is still in the area north of the Liutang River. The National Army on the Tongjian Line has completed a north-south coalition. The bandits besieging Jiancheng and Funing were compressed and fled west to Linze and other places northeast of Yougao. There was some engagement on the 24th. Furthermore, the National Army moving south from Guanyun recovered Zhangdian on the 23rd and continued south. At dawn on the 24th, they continued to capture Xin'an. The bandits fled north to Binhai and Lianshui, and the National Army split into two routes to pursue them to Shunheji and Yunshuikou.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Military, Government, and People's Representatives Hold a Symposium on Suppressing the Rebellion; Seven Articles of Civil Regulations are Established</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 24th] Over a hundred military, government, and people's representatives from Qingdao City held an expanded symposium on mobilizing to suppress the rebellion today, presided over by Commander Liu Anqi, Mayor Jiang Xuesui, and Speaker Li Daifang. Representatives from all sectors expressed their opinions on the current situation with great enthusiasm. Participants had the same understanding: Loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, and bandits and we cannot stand together. They are willing to be in the same step, share the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion, transform social customs, sacrifice their lives and wealth, and promote the unity of over one million citizens to exert infinite popular power and eliminate the bandit scourge. They also established civil regulations to be jointly observed, as follows: (1) Everyone participates in self-defense organizations, (2) Everyone receives wartime training, (3) Everyone fulfills the task of suppressing the rebellion, (4) Everyone donates military supplies and wealth, (5) Everyone assists in economic blockade, (6) Everyone is responsible for arresting bandit spies, (7) Everyone fulfills the thrifty movement.</p>

<h3>President Hosts Banquet for Presidents and Professors of Various Colleges and Universities in Beiping, Soliciting Opinions on the Economy; Weng Wenhao May Fly Back to Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] President Chiang hosted a banquet for President Weng Wenhao, Vice President Zhang Lisheng, and presidents and professors of various colleges and universities in Beiping, including Hu Shi, Chen Yuan, Mei Yiqi, Lu Zhiwei, Yuan Dunli, Zhao Naibo, Jiang Shuojie, Zhou Zuoren, Chen Daisun, Wu Jingchao, Liu Dazhong, Dai Siguang, Zhao Shouyu, He Lin, and Zhu Guangwei, at his residence at 8:00 PM on the 24th. He inquired about the opinions of various scholars on the current economic problems for consideration.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] Premier Weng Wenhao believes that it has been two months since the implementation of currency reform and emergency economic measures. It is urgent to gather wisdom and seek expert opinions as a reference for future decisions. He took the opportunity of coming to Beiping to meet with the President and seek instructions and invited professors, scholars, and economic experts from various universities in Beiping to hold a symposium to exchange views. The symposium was held on the afternoon of the 24th and did not end until 8:00 PM. It is learned that the symposium had a broad discussion on the general situation after the reform of the currency system and the implementation of emergency economic plans. The professors and experts actively spoke and expressed their opinions. They focused on discussing the following issues: (1) banks stopping loans, (2) freezing deposits, (3) stopping the clearing of bills, believing that in the current situation, it is necessary to tighten credit funds in order to determine effective measures to stabilize the currency system and prices. Although the symposium broadly exchanged views on various issues, no specific decisions were made. Premier Weng will invite several experts from the professors to accompany him to Nanjing and then work with the heads of government agencies to jointly study the actual situation and refer to academic theories to determine measures that meet actual needs. According to authoritative sources, the current price problem is hovering on the edge of price limits and negotiated prices. If the price limits are lifted for a part of the goods, then the prices of all goods will be affected. Only the allocation of essential consumer goods can stabilize general prices. The prices of other goods should also be adjusted appropriately in order to strive for the source of materials. Therefore, to stabilize the currency system and prices, we should seek a solution through the allocation of essential consumer goods and the appropriate adjustment of the prices of other goods. At 8:00 PM, the President hosted a banquet for celebrities and scholars in the education field at his official residence to listen to their opinions. Those invited to participate included university presidents Lu Zhiwei, Chen Yuanchun, Yuan Dunli, and Mei Yiqi, as well as several professors who participated in Premier Weng's symposium in the afternoon. During the banquet, Premier Weng reported to the President the exchange of views at the symposium and the invitation of experts to go to Nanjing to conduct further research with the competent authorities. The presidents and professors also expressed their opinions to the President separately, which the President greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Weng Wenhao hosted a luncheon for Fu Zuoyi, Chu Xichun, Liu Yaozhang, and Zheng Daoru on the 24th. Before the banquet, he held a symposium to discuss political and economic issues in North China. Weng may return to Nanjing on the 25th. When asked by reporters whether the price limits would be lifted or changed, Weng replied that the price limit issue was under study and would be announced as soon as there were results and asked the press to help more.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] Mayor Du Jianshi of Tianjin was summoned and went to Beiping at 9:00 AM on the 24th to meet Premier Weng.</p>

<h3>Vice President Li Presides over the United Nations Day Celebration; Reads the President's Message, Reaffirming Confidence and Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Presidential Palace solemnly commemorated "United Nations Day" on the morning of the 24th. President Chiang issued a message, reaffirming his confidence in the United Nations organization and reiterating his enthusiasm for international peace and cooperation. This message was read by Vice President Li on his behalf at the commemorative meeting. On the 24th, the United Nations flag was hung high at the entrance of the Presidential Palace, with colorful colors fluttering in the wind. At 10:00 AM, the commemorative ceremony began. Vice President Li presided over the meeting. Zhonggui civil and military officials Yu Youren, Jia Jingde, Liu Zhe, Wu Dingchang, etc. all attended the grand ceremony. After Vice President Li led the ceremony, he read the President's message on the spot, and then the ceremony was completed. The original text of the President's message is as follows:</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution at its second regular session, declaring October 24th as "United Nations Day." People of all countries in the world will reaffirm their confidence in the United Nations organization on this day every year and reiterate their enthusiasm for international peace and cooperation.</p>
<p>The designation of October 24th as "United Nations Day" has a profound significance. Three years ago on this day, the Charter of the United Nations came into effect, giving infinite hope to the people of the world. From this day on, the greatest organization in history to promote peace, the United Nations organization, began its mission, in accordance with the principles established in the Charter, to achieve the purposes it proclaimed. All peace-loving people share a determination to seek its success.</p>
<p>In the past three years, the United Nations organization and its member states have made significant achievements in achieving the purposes of the United Nations organization. Countries have submitted various international disputes to the United Nations organization for peaceful resolution and have promoted international cooperation in economic and social aspects. In addition, measures have been properly formulated for the development of underdeveloped areas of the world in order to promote the well-being of the local people. In short, its scope of activities extends to all parts of the world and is closely related to human life.</p>
<p>However, the purposes and principles of the United Nations have not been fully realized. The success of the United Nations organization still depends on the joint efforts of the people of all countries. The Chinese people are peaceful by nature, and not long ago, they suffered from the scourge of aggression. They have long vowed to assist the achievement of the goals of the United Nations organization with their power. This effort will not be relaxed.</p>
<p>On this "United Nations Day," the Chinese people reiterate their confidence and enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Yang Aiyuan Visits the President to Request Instructions on Military Assistance to Taiyuan; Highlands of Sucun in Northwest Shanxi Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] After Xu Yongchang was summoned by the President and arrived in Beiping to meet the President, he met with Yang Aiyuan to discuss matters related to assistance to Taiyuan.

<h3>Price Increases for State-Owned Public Utilities and Transportation are Inevitable; Part of the Postal Rate Plan Has Been Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] After the currency reform, in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on Organizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control, the postal rate portion of the fees for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises was adjusted based on the pre-war standard rate. The plan proposed by the Ministry of Transportation has been reviewed and approved by the Executive Yuan and has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, requesting that the legislative procedures be completed as usual. It is learned that the adjustment principle is to collect the Gold Yuan for all postal rates in 1937, that is, 5 cents for ordinary letters (equivalent to 150,000 Legal Tender, which is 10 times higher than the current price), 13 cents for single registered letters (equivalent to 390,000 Legal Tender, which is about 8.67 times higher than the current price), 21 cents for double registered letters (equivalent to 630,000 Legal Tender, which is about 8.67 times higher than the current price), and 17 cents for express letters (equivalent to 510,000 Legal Tender, which is about 8.5 times higher than the current price). It is also learned that telegram fees will also be adjusted according to the same principle, that is, 10 cents per word for ordinary Chinese telegrams and 2.5 cents per word for news telegrams. However, in accordance with the law, it does not need to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and may be announced and implemented at the same time as the prices of other state-owned enterprises.</p>
<h3>Content of the Executive Yuan's Message Answering the Legislative Yuan's Inquiry</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] Price increases for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises are inevitable. Postal rate increases have also been drafted. In its message answering the Legislative Yuan's inquiry on the proposal to stop state-owned enterprises from raising prices individually and immediately, the Executive Yuan explained that Article 3 of the Regulations on Organizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control clearly stipulates that the fees for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises whose fees are lower than the pre-war standard should be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard. It is a policy decided at the same time as the currency reform and is not a self-destruction of the law. The message also pointed out that the fees of various public and transportation enterprises are indeed too low due to the increase in fuel prices. In order to continue to maintain them, it is impossible not to consider the actual costs and make appropriate adjustments. As for the adjusted prices, they are still under close study, and those that should go through the Legislative Yuan procedures will be handled as usual. For example, the postal rate adjustment plan has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The content of the Executive Yuan's message is as follows: (1) Consolidating the value of the new currency is not only effective by maintaining the value on August 19th. If the government's revenue and expenditure gap is also frozen to the state on August 19th without seeking improvement, then the new currency will continue to inflate, and the value of the currency will still not be stable. Therefore, the government's currency reform must balance the treasury's revenue and expenditure in order to reduce the issuance of the new currency. Therefore, state-owned enterprises should strive to be self-sufficient, and areas that are not militarily damaged should no longer be subsidized. This was stipulated in Article 3 of the Regulations on Organizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control, which stipulated that the fees for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises whose fees are lower than the pre-war standard should be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard. Article 4 stipulates that all such enterprises should strive to save expenses so as not to increase too much when adjusting prices. This is actually a policy decided at the same time as the currency reform and is not a self-destruction of the law. (2) The issue of price increases for state-owned enterprises is currently under close study. Items such as postal rate adjustments, which should go through the Legislative Yuan procedures, have been submitted for review. (3) The fees of various public and transportation enterprises are indeed too low due to the increase in foreign exchange and fuel prices. It is not enough to only reduce personnel and tighten business expenses. In addition to the business that has been considered to be discontinued, it seems impossible not to consider its actual costs and make appropriate adjustments in order to maintain it.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance to Formulate Measures for Capital Increase of Provincial and County Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Finance has formulated measures for the capital increase of provincial and county banks in stages. The minimum capital of county banks nationwide, regardless of region, is 50,000 Gold Yuan. Provincial banks will refer to the measures for capital increase of commercial banks. Provincial banks in various provinces nationwide are divided into several levels. The banks in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces are the first level, with a minimum capital of 1 million Gold Yuan. The deadline for capital increase is the same as for commercial banks.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance is Properly Reviewing Loan Policies and Measures; Grain Loans are also Being Considered Together</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] According to the Ministry of Finance, since the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Order and the suspension of loans by national banks and treasuries, the Ministry of Finance is now sending a letter to the Central Bank to carefully review the cases of loan requests from various provinces and cities for the purchase of grain. The Ministry of Finance is also properly reviewing the entire loan policy and measures. Grain loans are a major item of loans and will also be considered together.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Retrocession Third Anniversary</h3>
<p>Today marks the third anniversary of Taiwan Retrocession Day, and the Taiwan Provincial Exposition is also scheduled to open today. Dignitaries from Taipei have gathered to celebrate this grand occasion. On this day three years ago, the surrender ceremony was held in Taiwan, where Japanese Governor-General Ando Rikiichi respectfully signed the surrender document on the spot. Chief Executive Chen Yi then announced it to China and abroad via broadcast. Thus, Taiwan, which had been occupied for 51 years, regained its light and returned to the motherland. Today, all sectors of Taiwanese society are holding a grand celebration. Key central government officials and attendees of the National Engineers' Annual Meeting have come to Taiwan to participate, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere. We sincerely wish the people of Taiwan happiness, the success of Taiwan's construction, and we foresee Taiwan's future flourishing and growing, illuminated by the glory of its retrocession!</p>
<p>Taiwan is a province of our country located between the East and South China Seas. The famous islands comprise three parts: Taiwan Island itself, the Penghu Islands, and the New Southern Islands, collectively known as Taiwan Province. Its shape resembles a banana leaf. The region faces the Pacific Ocean to the east, Fujian Province to the west, the Ryukyu Islands to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Its terrain is strategically important, and its products are abundant. The land area is 35,961 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 6.6 million people. The main dialect belongs to the Southern Min language family. The ancestors of the residents are mostly buried in the Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Chaozhou, and Huizhou prefectures of Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The customs, habits, and rural lifestyles throughout the region are all based on the models of Guangdong and Fujian provinces.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of Taiwan's strategic location, it has historically been subjected to foreign invasions. In the 32nd year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1604 AD), the Dutch first entered and occupied the Penghu Islands, and then occupied Taiwan Island itself, engaging in development and extensive exploitation; this was Taiwan's first encounter with foreign aggression. In the sixth year of the Tianqi reign (1626 AD), the Spanish invaded Taiwan. In the 21st year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1841 AD), the British harbored covetous intentions. In the ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1883 AD), French troops also eyed Taiwan. Although these multiple invasions were crushed, they foreshadowed Taiwan's entanglement in the whirlpool of world politics amidst the imperialist scramble. Japan's coveting of Taiwan began in the mid-Ming Dynasty. Its actual possession of Taiwan began after the occupation of the Ryukyu Islands (first year of Guangxu, 1875 AD). After the Sino-Japanese War, the Treaty of Shimonoseki (21st year of Guangxu, 1895 AD) formally ceded Taiwan to Japan, resulting in 51 years of exclusive rule. During the period when Taiwan was contested by the great powers, China made efforts to regain sovereignty. For example, after the Dutch entered Taiwan, Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) recovered it. Zheng Chenggong's son, Zheng Jing, ruled Taiwan for 23 years. After Zheng Jing's death, his son Zheng Kezang ushered in the end of that 23-year glorious history. Subsequently, Taiwanese people continued to engage in restoration movements, such as Zhu Yigui and Zhu Shuangwen. After the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, Taiwanese patriot Qiu Fengjia declared independence and organized the Republic of Formosa, which was defeated by Japanese troops. However, the nation's integrity shines brightly in history. Therefore, for 50 years, Taiwan refused to submit, resisting the Japanese invaders with wave after wave of courageous fighters, engaging in over a hundred bloody battles. During World War II, the Cairo Declaration proclaimed that Taiwan would still belong to us. After the victory, our country accepted the surrender document from the Japanese governor-general on October 25, 1945. From that day on, the entire province's territory returned to the motherland. Six million Taiwanese compatriots saw the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag for the first time, rejoicing across the land and filled with boundless hope. Today, as we celebrate Taiwan's retrocession, the scene is as if it were happening before our eyes. What an exciting thing it is!</p>
<p>We value the importance of Taiwan's geographical location and the history of the Taiwanese people's struggle. We cherish the great significance of Taiwan's retrocession all the more. Naturally, we place infinite hope in Taiwan's political and economic construction. Taiwan's politics do not seem to have made much progress in the past three years. The "February 28th Incident" of last year was truly the most unpleasant event in Taiwan. Even now, thinking back on it, we feel particularly sorry for the people of Taiwan. However, domestic strife must not be treated like brothers quarreling within the walls. We have always felt deep sympathy for the people of Taiwan and have expressed great regret for the measures taken by the local government. Currently, the relationship between Taiwanese compatriots and those from other provinces is mostly positive and satisfactory, and order in various counties and cities is extremely stable, indicating that Taiwan Province is not lacking in enlightened individuals. This March, national assembly representatives gathered in the capital, and Taiwanese national representatives requested the central government to issue a clear decree designating Taiwan as a demonstration zone for the implementation of local autonomy. We deeply feel that Taiwan possesses the conditions for autonomy and should assist Taiwanese compatriots in fully embracing the spirit of constitutionalism, implementing local autonomy as soon as possible, and bringing Taiwan's politics onto the right track. The economic problem in Taiwan can be said to be the livelihood problem of six million people, and it is of utmost importance. In the past, under Japanese rule, there was only exploitation and plunder. The people were mostly poor and helpless, with living standards close to starvation, and there was no such thing as "full employment." In the three years since then, the waves of domestic economic instability have struck Taiwan, causing fluctuations in Taiwan's economic construction. Fortunately, Taiwan's efforts to "seek prosperity amidst stability" have been able to resist the waves, so Taiwan has been able to maintain a relatively comfortable situation. If the government can truly promote provincial construction economically and invigorate the provincial economy, and further promote local autonomy politically, then Taiwan will surely be filled with a bright future. This is our greatest wish for celebrating Taiwan Retrocession Day.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that as we commemorate Taiwan Retrocession Day, we deeply feel the preciousness of the meaning of retrocession. We hope that the local government of Taiwan and the compatriots of Taiwan Province cherish the historical significance of retrocession, work hard to unite, be of one heart and one mind, and create together, making Taiwan the most beautiful garden in China. They should wash away the years of suffering of the Taiwanese people and attain a state of happiness and well-being as soon as possible. The Taiwan Exposition and the National Engineers' Annual Meeting will successively open during this grand event, symbolizing the happiness and well-being that Taiwan is about to reach. We sincerely pray that the compatriots of Taiwan and people from all walks of life will work hard to create and bring about a bright and splendid future as soon as possible!</p>

<p>(1) President's Admonitory Speech "Chairman Wei forwards to the Taiwan Retrocession Third Anniversary Commemoration Conference for review: Taiwan washed away the shame of being occupied for fifty years and returned to the motherland, it has already been three years since then. People who have been away from their homeland for a long time, once they are able to return to their homeland and reunite with their elders and brothers, their joy in their hearts is self-evident. Now that we have been reunited for a long time, the connections are even closer. Regarding the happiness of the entire family, we must think about how to contribute and fulfill our responsibility as a member. Taiwan has superior geographical conditions and abundant products. The results of construction in the past relied on the active efforts of the compatriots of the entire province. It is also outstanding and ranks among the best in the provinces of the country. Now that constitutional government has been implemented and the suppression of bandits is becoming increasingly tense, the maritime barrier and the pillar of reconstruction are even more important. All levels of agencies and compatriots throughout the province should be vigilant during these difficult times, recognize their responsibilities, strive to improve themselves, and pledge their loyalty together, so that Taiwan's construction will advance to a new stage and become a model for the whole country, spreading its blessings without limit. There are great hopes. Chiang Kai-shek"</p>

<h3>Only by Forming an International Army Can the World Have Peace: He Yingqin's Remarks to Reporters Upon Arrival in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Minister of National Defense He Yingqin stated at a press conference in Taipei on the afternoon of the 24th, "Today is United Nations Day. I sincerely hope that the United Nations will have the power to promote world peace. I worked in the United States for a long time. At first, I hoped to form an international army within a year or two, but things did not go as planned. Our work has not achieved anything, and the contradictions between countries have increased even more. I still believe that only by forming an international army can the world have peace." When talking about the Japan issue, he said, "Japan's economic recovery cannot be completed in a short period of time. This requires assistance from China and the United States, especially from China. We certainly hope to sign a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, but so far the major powers have different opinions, and it is hoped that it will be difficult to achieve in the short term." He came to attend the Retrocession Day celebration and will return to Nanjing in two or three days. Chen Cheng, who is recuperating in Caoshan, visited He Yingqin in Taipei at 4:00 PM. Afterwards, Chairman Wei Daoming and Commander Peng Mengji accompanied him to visit the exposition preview. In the crowded exposition venue, He and Chen were both figures of great attention.

<h3>Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly Huang Chaoqin Discusses Two Missions to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, went to Nanjing on official business earlier this month and returned to Taipei on the 23rd. He stated in a speech that the purpose of his trip to Nanjing was: (1) to request the central government to change the exchange rate between Taiwan dollars and gold yuan and to restore the flexibility of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate. Premier Weng was very clear about Taiwan's economic situation and expressed considerable sympathy, promising to find a way to remedy the situation when the opportunity arises, but did not mention the method or date. (2) The assets and deposits of the province's commercial banks all exceed their capital by more than 100 times, so there is no need to increase capital. Premier Weng and Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance said that the matter concerned laws and regulations and could not be handled unilaterally, but they agreed that the banks would still use Taiwan dollars as capital and increase the capital of branch offices at the county level, without increasing the capital of each branch office by 10,000 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Limits Exchange of Gold Yuan; Merchants Refuse to Use Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[Report from Qingdao, This Newspaper, 24th] After the Central Bank limited the exchange of gold yuan notes to ten yuan, the phenomenon of merchants refusing to use legal tender has spread throughout the city in recent days.</p>
<h3>Rushes, Controls, and Rations: Collection of Market Conditions and Economic Trends in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The lack of materials is a common phenomenon throughout the county. There are prices but no goods in various markets, which intensifies the rush to buy, resulting in a serious "shortage of goods." Although there is a supply of rice, it is only a drop in the bucket. On the 24th, thousands of people lined up in Huihe Town to compete for purchases, causing great chaos. Fortunately, order was maintained properly, and no incidents occurred. In addition, on the 24th, the police station seized more than 60 large bags of white rice that were being smuggled out of the country at the Xihulu intersection.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The county's Materials Regulation Office was formally established on the morning of the 24th, and food rice and other major daily necessities in the urban area will be rationed. In order to maintain the people's food supply, the county government stipulates that any public or private firm that does not have a unified pass from the Shanghai Economic Supervision Commissioner's Office or purchases beyond the limited price will have all their goods deducted and used as public grain for the towns and villages. Those with permits must copy and verify the document number on the permit before allowing them to pass, so that they can go to Shanghai to exchange for daily necessities based on the purchase figures and transport them to Changshu for public sale.</p>
<p>Kunming</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The new negotiated prices for 83 industries in Kunming were originally under review, but the Executive Yuan ordered the provincial government to not allow self-negotiated prices in various places, and the new prices ended up being a fleeting moment. The trend of closing doors and refusing to sell has risen again. Although the authorities ordered businesses to open, the shelves are mostly empty, and the people's psychology of rushing to buy is extremely strong. The rice market is subject to price increases and decreases, and negotiated prices have completely failed.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>

<h3>Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the United Nations Founding, Grand Ceremony Held at the Palais de Chaillot, Evatt's Speech Explaining the Achievements of the General Assembly in the Past Three Years, President Chiang's Telegram to the General Assembly Expressing Congratulations</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly held a ceremony this afternoon at the Palais de Chaillot to celebrate the third "United Nations Day" anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter. The crowd was extremely dense, with representatives from various countries seated on the podium, while the representatives' seats were given to guests. United Nations representatives in attendance included General Assembly President and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, British Deputy Prime Minister McNeil, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, French Foreign Minister Schuman, and others. The flags of the 58 member states were hung on the podium, and two United Nations guards in blue-gray uniforms, adorned with the UN earth and grain emblem, stood beside the podium. Congratulatory telegrams were received from Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek and heads of state from various countries. At the opening of the celebration, the preamble to the United Nations Charter was first read in complete silence by the chairman. Afterwards, French Foreign Minister Schuman delivered a speech, expressing his deep confidence in the United Nations organization and hoping that morality could replace force in the future.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] During the United Nations Day celebration, when representatives from various countries spoke, some touched upon the failures of the United Nations. General Assembly President Evatt gave a final "general response," emphasizing the achievements of the United Nations in the economic, social, and cultural fields, as well as the success in halting the fires of war in Palestine, Indonesia, and India.</p>
<p>[Taiwanese Mass News Agency, Paris, 23rd] United Nations General Assembly President Evatt delivered a speech on the 23rd at the Palais de Chaillot, the temporary headquarters of the United Nations in Paris, during the ceremony commemorating the third anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, strongly condemning pessimism, cynicism, lack of vitality, laziness, and "professionalized specters" unwilling to fight for principles. He pointed out that these people were trying to undermine the United Nations. In his vigorous defense of the United Nations, Mr. Evatt asked the world to try to close their eyes and think about "what would have happened" in the past three years if the United Nations had not been established. Mr. Evatt said: "We should close our eyes and think about what would have happened if the United Nations had not been established. Our great goal is peace. Our greatest enemy is war. But unfortunately, pessimism about the United Nations, especially about maintaining peace, has become a habit among some people. Cynicism is unwilling to accept new ideas, lacks vitality, is lazy and unwilling to fight for the principles of establishing the United Nations Charter. All of these are forces that claim that our difficulties will overcome us and lead people to undermine the United Nations." Evatt pointed out the existence of disputes in Palestine, Indonesia, and Kashmir, and said that the United Nations had either prevented them in the above-mentioned events or had strictly limited the combatants.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Americans today enthusiastically celebrated United Nations Day, holding gatherings to discuss the goals of the United Nations, holding educational exhibitions of joint work, and praying for the success of the Paris Assembly. National leaders appealed to the American people in broadcasts to be patient with the three-year-old United Nations. American public opinion generally stated that the enthusiasm for the ideals of the United Nations in those years has gradually disappeared due to reality. Without the support of the member states, the United Nations itself cannot maintain peace. Furthermore, the United States should maintain its strong national power for the sake of ensuring its own security and should form alliances with friendly countries.</p>
<h3>Solution to the Berlin Crisis, Rumor Has It That the Soviets Will Veto, Political Committee Subgroup, the United States Refutes Soviet Disarmament Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd, United Press] Authoritative sources recently predicted that the Soviet Union will overturn the neutral countries' solution to the Berlin crisis in the Security Council with its veto power. It is reported that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky told Security Council President Bramuglia that Moscow rejected the so-called "compromise solution." Latin American sources also stated that Vyshinsky invited Bramuglia for a long talk this afternoon, implying that he would overturn the above proposal with a veto. However, commentators emphasized that Vyshinsky did not express the Soviet Union's decision to overturn the proposal. Vyshinsky's attitude has always been cautious, and he never shows all his cards until the time is right.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] When the United Nations Political Committee's special subcommittee discussed the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal today, U.S. Representative Osborne objected, saying: "According to French newspapers, even after the Soviet army has been reduced by one-third, it still has 150 divisions. There are also 66 divisions in the satellite countries, while the United States only has six divisions in its own country, and only 14 divisions of U.S. troops in Western Europe. If these figures are correct, they are truly astounding." Soviet Representative Malik immediately replied: "He would like to know how many atomic bombs the United States has, and how many divisions of troops are equivalent to these atomic bombs." Subsequently, after representatives from El Salvador and Belgium spoke one after another, the subcommittee adjourned and was scheduled to reconvene on Monday.

<h3>East German People's Council Demands Withdrawal of Troops</h3>
<p>Convening a Meeting of Foreign Ministers to Build a Sound German Government</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 24th] The Communist-backed "People's Council" on the 24th, following the Soviet Union, demanded the convening of a foreign ministers' conference to discuss the entire German issue. The council passed a resolution demanding that the victorious nations fulfill their promises to rebuild a economically and politically unified Germany and establish an all-German government. The resolution also demanded the withdrawal of occupying forces.</p>
<h3>British, American, and French Military Governors Scheduled to Meet at the End of the Month to Discuss the New Situation in West Germany</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Frankfurt, 23rd] The military governors of British, American, and French occupied Germany, Robertson, Clay, and Koenig, are scheduled to meet on October 30 to discuss the new situation in West Germany and study the form of occupying government proposed by the constitutional drafting committee.</p>
<h3>Soviets Demand Replacement of Important Berlin Officials, Including the Mayor, Speaker, and Councilors</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] The Soviet Union formally accused the Mayor of Berlin and five other officials on the 23rd of violating the Four Power Berlin Agreement and demanded their dismissal and punishment. The Soviet News Bureau claimed that Soviet courts accused them of giving "fascist" speeches that the Allied Control Council had explicitly prohibited. This accusation has now been submitted to the "appropriate military authorities" for the punishment of these officials. The Soviet Union's so-called "appropriate authorities" are presumably the Soviet military government and the military governments of the three Western powers. Those accused include Acting Mayor Friedensburg, unrecognized Mayor Reuter, City Council Speaker Suhr, and City Councilors Naumann, Mattick, and Markewitz.</p>
<h3>British King to Preside Over the Opening Ceremony of Parliament Tomorrow, Nationalization of Steel Industry Bill to Cause Controversy</h3>
<p>[Taiwanese Mass News Agency, London, 24th] British King George will wear the crown, which is already ten years old, to preside over the opening ceremony of Parliament on the 26th. When he returns, the royal procession will once again feature grand scenes. This ceremony is solemn and complete. The King will depart from Buckingham Palace, passing through streets lined with red-uniformed guards, and enter the House of Lords. On this day, he will wear parliamentary robes of red and black. This session will be a do-or-die battle between the Conservative and Labour parties over the Labour government's steel industry nationalization bill before the general election. Its nature is far superior to the reappearance of old official rituals. The opposition party admits that it cannot prevent the bill from becoming law, but hopes to use the excuse that the Labour Party's state control will bankrupt the country to attack the socialists in the general election 14 months later. In the House of Lords, it will obstruct the passage of the bill with delaying tactics. The Labour Party has proposed an amendment to the Parliamentary Act to reduce the effective period of the House of Lords' veto from two years to one year, so that the nationalization bill will become a legal part of the law before the general election.</p>
<h3>The French Miners' Strike is Increasingly Treacherous, Miners and Soldiers in a Standoff, Situation in the Central Mining Area is Most Critical</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] The unexpected incidents of the French coal miners' strike are still limited to the central coal area. In Montceau, 88 miles north of Lyon, government troops reinforced and attacked the Arowa mine. Everything in the Firmini area of Saint-Étienne has been shut down due to the general strike, and the situation is now becoming increasingly tense. In the north, which has always been known as a communist belt, the government only strengthened its military strength and did not launch an attack to recover the mines occupied by the strikers. The strike in the central region, especially in the Arowa mine, where 2,000 soldiers are surrounding the miners, remains the most critical. The strikers are asking for help with factory sirens. It is reported that thousands of miners are concentrated on the roads leading to the mine. The military police are fully armed and blocking the roads. On the morning of the 24th, the police took down the Saint-Louis and Morgue mines in the Montceau area in a lightning action and arrested 25 armed people.</p>
<h3>The Five Foreign Ministers of the Western European Alliance Are Scheduled to Meet in Paris Today, The Main Agenda Will Discuss the Issue of Europe's Entry into a Federal Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] French Foreign Minister Schuman, with the full support of the U.S. government, will attempt this week to persuade the five foreign ministers of the Western European Alliance that Europe must unite or perish together. The quarterly meeting of the Western European Alliance will begin here on the 25th. The main topics will be the European Union and the prospects for the Western European Union and the United States and Canada to sign the North Atlantic Collective Defense Treaty. British Foreign Secretary Bevin can come here from London on the evening of the 24th to participate in the meeting. Although the Western European Union is loudly advocating its intentions, Bevin and the British Labour Party are the main obstacles to this plan. Britain believes that it is currently unrealistic to talk about a federal union. It is reported that once the U.S. election is over, the U.S. and Canada are expected to begin preparing extensively for the conclusion of the North Atlantic Collective Defense Treaty with the Western European Alliance. The treaty will be established in accordance with the norms of the Rio de Janeiro Western Hemisphere Collective Defense Treaty of September 1948. When the treaty is underway, the United States is also expected to complete its plan to provide military assistance to the Western European Alliance. The prerequisite for U.S. aid is that the West must first help itself, so the five foreign ministers of the alliance will work hard to promote the self-help plan. The Western European Alliance's regular meeting will begin on the morning of the 25th, with a second meeting in the afternoon and a final meeting on the morning of the 26th. The meeting place is in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the banks of the Seine, about one mile from the Palais de Chaillot, the venue of the United Nations General Assembly. Schuman, as the host, will serve as chairman. In addition to Schuman and Bevin, those present will include Luxembourg Foreign Minister Huet and Dutch Foreign Minister Stijkel. The agenda includes: (1) Approval of the agreement of the five countries' defense ministers, such as the establishment of the military organization led by Marshal Montgomery. (2) Proposing recommendations for the initial work of the five countries' economic alliance. (3) Studying the possibility of the United States and Canada concluding a Transatlantic Collective Defense Treaty due to the election of the new U.S. Congress. (4) Discussing the motion proposed by France to convene a preparatory committee to organize a pan-European parliament. (5) Other committee routine reports. The most important item on the agenda is the federal issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] It was learned on the 24th that after the U.S. elections, Canada is expected to immediately devote itself to drafting a defense treaty with the Western Alliance. The treaty will be similar to the Rio de Janeiro Convention. Instead of committing the United States to participate in the war, it stipulates that mutual consultations must be held in possible war measures. It is generally hoped that by the spring of next year, the North Atlantic Treaty and the peacetime military plan can be completed.</p>
<h3>Martial Law in Bolivia, Revolutionaries Arrested</h3>
<p>Assassination Plot Discovered in Cuba</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, La Paz, 24th, United Press] The Bolivian government has announced martial law throughout the country, and the masterminds of the attempted revolution, twelve people, have been arrested. The president ordered martial law throughout the country because public order was under serious threat. The conspirators planned to infiltrate trade unions to create incidents similar to the riots that occurred when the Pan-American Conference was held in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cuban Capital, 24th] Authoritative sources reported on the 24th that many leftist conspirators were plotting to assassinate the U.S. and Mexican ambassadors to Cuba, as well as important Cuban officials. Their main members could be arrested at any time. It is reported that President Socarras and Minister of Education Alencourt were also on the list of those to be assassinated.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Southern Korea is Chaotic, Rumor Has It That Government Troops Recaptured Sil City and Suncheon, Part of the Rebel Army Infiltrated the Zili Mountain Area</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 24th] Minister of the Interior Yoon Chi-young is scheduled to go to Suncheon on the 24th. According to his announcement on the evening of the 23rd, the rebel army was surrounded in five places and gradually resolved by the security forces. He firmly believed that the rebellion could be completely quelled on the morning of the 25th. However, the U.S. military headquarters' report did not fully support Yoon's optimistic conclusion. The security forces' recapture of Yeosu, the source of the rebellion, has not been confirmed by U.S. officials in the area. At the same time, rebels are still very active in the southern coastal area. It is reported that another branch of the rebel army has infiltrated the Zili Mountain area and occupied Baoyouzhen.</p>
<p>According to the report of Cenard, a neutral observer who returned to Seoul from the U.S. Temporary Military Advisory Group Office in Gwangju on the 23rd, it confirms the Korean side's news that the security forces have recovered Yeosu and Suncheon. Cenard left Yeosu one day before the rebellion occurred, and his report can be regarded as a first-hand report of what he saw.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 24th] The Security Forces Command reported on the 24th that the Security Forces had penetrated Yeosu from both land and sea on the morning of the 23rd to test the strength of the rebel army, and then withdrew to the ships in the port. The Security Forces suffered six deaths and injuries. There is no report on the number of deaths and injuries of the rebel army. In Suncheon, a total of 86 civilian and detective corpses were found by American observers, some of whom were executed by the rebel army. They estimated that the total number of deaths was around 150. The Security Forces Headquarters also reported that Baocheng was recovered at noon on the 24th, and the situation in Guangyang is still unclear.</p>

At the same time, the party claimed that the recent rumors spread by some saboteurs were nothing more than attempts to incite regional views in Korea, where they could not bear to kill each other.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Indochinese People's League here telegraphed the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on the 24th, appealing to the United Nations to liberate the two million people of Indochina from French oppression. The telegram requested that the United Nations urge France to allow the true independence of Indochina, condemning the autonomy that France has now allowed as "empty." Indochina still has no right to handle foreign affairs, military affairs, and economic affairs. In addition, the League also opposed the negotiations between King Bao Dai and France, believing that the negotiations could only establish a puppet government. The people of Indochina will continue to fight for independence. The telegram warned that the instability of the situation will make Indochina a fertile ground for communism.</p>

The organization of the United Nations represents the ideal of human peace and the ultimate goal of global harmony. This lofty and sacred goal is now deeply imprinted in our minds. How to promote its realization still depends on the cooperative efforts of people around the world. After the First World War, the League of Nations was created. After this war, the United Nations was created. Historically, humanity has felt the preciousness of peace more acutely after each major war, and several peaceful international alliances have often emerged as a result. This shows that humanity is indeed constantly progressing. Although the current United Nations is more advanced than the previous League of Nations, its organization has not yet reached the soundness of our ideal. For example, the United Nations does not have an international police force to safeguard world peace and order, nor does it have a way to limit member states from abusing their veto power. Today, as we celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the United Nations Charter, we are not simply praising the current United Nations but hoping that it will continue to progress based on its lofty and sacred ideals, promote their realization, and reach the day of permanent world peace."</p>
<p>Li Huang Reports on the Charter Signing Situation That Year</p>
<p>Following this, Li Huang, our country's representative to the United Nations, reported on the discussion process and signing of the United Nations Charter. Mr. Li stated: "The United Nations Charter was discussed for two months, and the meetings often ran from morning to evening. The work was extremely careful. The ten members of the Chinese delegation each attended a subcommittee, and they held a meeting every morning to jointly review the work. The signing ceremony when the Charter was concluded was extremely solemn. After discussions, our delegation decided to sign the Charter, which would be published simultaneously in five languages, in Chinese. Among the delegates, Wang Chonghui, as a legal expert, never relaxed his scrutiny of the Charter's articles. Gu Weijun and Wu Yifang also spoke extensively, making valuable contributions." Mr. Li concluded by pointing out that the United Nations General Assembly and the post-World War I international conferences were quite different. The diplomatic tactics of secret consultations that were prevalent in the past have been abandoned in the United Nations General Assembly. Although the disputes among the representatives of the various countries were fierce, they were still able to meet each other with sincerity and frankly present their own demands. Therefore, the concluded Charter, in addition to the original ideals, also took into account the facts. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, emphasized the "socialization" principle that he has consistently advocated in his speech. He stated that although the United Nations organization is a manifestation of international peaceful socialization, socialization is still only a part. To actively maintain world peace, it is necessary to expand and deepen socialization into all levels, using cooperative forces to stop ambitious elements from inciting international wars.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan Expresses the Need to Establish a Psychological Foundation</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan stated in his address: "Today's celebration of United Nations Day by all circles in this city is truly a manifestation of the deep penetration of the United Nations ideal. To keep the United Nations Charter permanently alive, we must establish a psychological foundation, for all great human constructions start from a single thought. The Charter begins with 'We the peoples of the United Nations' without distinguishing borders, which is the best illustration of the psychological foundation. We must always view ourselves as 'the peoples of the United Nations' for the hope of human peace to be realized. We believe that with the strength of all the peoples of the United Nations, working together to end wars and safeguard world peace, we will surely succeed. Mencius said, 'The world hangs on being settled. Being settled depends on unity. He who does not delight in killing can unify it.' The United Nations is a concrete manifestation of 'being settled depends on unity,' and world peace will certainly not be destroyed by warmongers who delight in killing."</p>
<p>Fang Zhi Hopes to Consolidate Unity and Permanently Preserve Peace</p>
<p>Fang Zhi, chairman of the Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Party Department, stated in his address that to safeguard world peace, it is necessary to strengthen the United Nations itself. He hoped that the 57 member states would demonstrate a spirit of cooperation based on "mutual trust, mutual belief, mutual assistance, and mutual aid," consolidate unity, and ensure permanent peace. Finally, Dr. Lu Nagen Sen, Secretary-General of the United Nations Far East Economic and Social Council, delivered a speech on behalf of the United Nations. He stated that the ideal of the United Nations is to promote human peace, eliminate war through the power of the people, and advance social, economic, and other constructions. This ideal is the goal we are jointly striving for, and we believe that by promoting the spirit of human benevolence and strengthening unity, we will surely achieve success. The meeting adjourned around 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Celebratory Commemorations and Other Programs</p>
<p>Other celebratory commemoration programs included: Civil Aviation Brigade aircraft scattering national flags and presidential messages, the Public Works Radio Station broadcasting special United Nations Day programs, and special services at Moore Memorial Church on Xizang Road and the American Church on Avenue Petain. From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, the United Nations Shanghai Office held a cocktail reception at the French Cultural Association on Nanchang Road, attended by over a hundred leaders from various circles, both Chinese and foreign, who enjoyed themselves thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Reduced Supply of Matches - Request to Re-determine Factory Wholesale Price</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Match Factory Industry Association states that due to the current shortage of match raw materials, procurement is difficult. Moreover, the "August 19th" price limit on matches coincided with a period when sales were relatively weak, and the factory wholesale price was low. Just as they were about to adjust it, they were suddenly frozen by the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree, resulting in a gradual decrease in production and supply. The industry's raw materials, such as cottonwood and certain chemicals, have always relied on import quotas, and the increased exchange rate has significantly impacted costs. The industry association has sent letters to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Economic Management and Supervision Office, requesting a re-determination of the actual production costs of the factories and the wholesale prices of each brand of matches, and has attached a table of raw material production costs for review.</p>
<h3>Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Industry Representatives - Request Release of Detained Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Over seventy dyeing and weaving factories in Wujin County purchased 1,130 bales of cotton yarn in Shanghai last month, which were detained by the Railway Bureau. This has led to the shutdown of many dyeing and weaving factories in the county, and workers have lost their jobs. The county's General Labor Union sent several representatives to Shanghai yesterday to visit Supervisor Jiang at the National Bank and petition him. Secretary Cai Baili received them and inquired about the details, promising to find a solution. If it is verified that the cotton yarn is genuine, he will send a letter to the Railway Bureau to release it.</p>
<h3>Black Market Chicken and Duck Dealers Discovered - Attempted Bribery Leads to Detention</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Xixiang, the group leader of the 39th Squad of the 8th Brigade of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps, and team members Yin Wenxi, Chen Wanggen, and Zheng Minghua, at 6:35 PM yesterday, saw Wu Zhongquan and Xue Songliu, who were trading chickens and ducks on the black market at the intersection of Baoyu Lane on South Zhejiang Road, acting suspiciously. The four team members noticed and went forward to question them. According to the two chicken buyers, the chickens and ducks were purchased on the black market at a price of 5.8 yuan per jin from Xinde Feng Chicken and Duck Shop at No. 37 Baoyu Lane. The four team members immediately went to the Xinde Feng Chicken and Duck Shop to inquire. The shop, realizing that its black market dealings had been discovered, attempted to bribe them, offering 100 gold yuan. The four team members, seeing that the shop admitted to buying and selling on the black market, immediately sent the witnesses to the Chenxiangge Squad Headquarters to request instructions.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Daily Necessities Registration - Spot Checks to Replace General Inspections</h3>
<p>After the deadline for the second phase of daily necessities registration, which was ordered to be handled by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the registered materials will no longer be subjected to general inspections because this work requires an uneconomical amount of manpower. Instead, spot checks will be used.</p>
<h3>Youth Missing on Haiyue Ship - Father Searches, Suddenly Receives Strange Letter</h3>
<p>Whether Victim of Homicide or Suicide Awaits Investigation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Peixian (see photo), alias Yude, 23 years old, from Cixian County, Hebei, boarded the Haiyue ship from Tianjin to Shanghai on June 10 of this year. For over three months, there has been no news. His father, Zhang Wenlin, currently a clerk at the Anyang District Court in Henan, came to Shanghai in pursuit and is staying at No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road. He has been searching everywhere in Shanghai, but without success. He advertised in the newspaper from the 7th to the 10th of this month, which stated: "Zhang Peixian, alias Yude, is from Cixian (Cizhou) County, Hebei Province. He is 23 years old. He boarded the Haiyue ship from Tianjin to Shanghai on June 10 of this year. For over three months, there has been no news. Kind-hearted individuals who know his whereabouts and can help find him will be rewarded with 100 gold yuan. Zhang Wenlin, No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road." Another notice stated: "Peixian, my son: Father has arrived in Shanghai. Everything is according to your wishes, and there will be no compulsion. You can come to No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road, for a talk, or send a letter. Zhang Wenlin." The advertisement ran for four days, but there was still no news. On the 15th and 16th, the advertisement was continued for two more days. On the morning of the 17th, Zhang Wenlin suddenly received a letter, written in a Wing-style fountain pen, which stated, "Mr. Peixian has already been murdered. I hope that Mr. Wenlin will go to the Shen Bao office today to inquire about the address of Mr. Deng from the Shanghai branch. Then the truth will come to light," signed Jingfu, with no address. At that time, Zhang Wenlin was hesitant after receiving the letter. Later, he came to this office to inquire. Afterwards, he suspected that the Shanghai branch was the Shanghai News Agency. He went to that agency to inquire, but there was no one named Deng. So he went to the Huangpu Police Branch to report. Chief Li then dispatched police officer Li ?ming to the Shanghai News Agency for detailed inquiry, but there were still no clues. He also came to this office to inquire about someone named Deng, but he could not find any information. Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhang Wenlin at his residence. According to him, Peixian went to Tianjin from his home in the spring of the year before last. Because after the victory, the original Cixian County area was unstable and uninhabitable, Peixian fled alone to Shanghai and stayed at the Yuqing Apartment at No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road. About a week later, he took a ship to Tianjin to work at the Gongtai Grocery Store at No. 14 Daliu Hutong, Qudian Street, for two years. Last winter, a fellow villager came to Tianjin and told him about the tragic situation in his hometown, including the murder of his grandfather and aunt. Peixian was immediately stunned. A few days later, he fell ill and was bedridden for half a month, and his nerves seemed to have become abnormal. Suddenly he disappeared. Afterwards, rewards were offered in various newspapers and broadcast on the radio, and searches were conducted everywhere. After he was found, he was sent to the hospital for treatment, and his mental state gradually returned to normal. Later, his uncle, Xinglin, learned about this and took a flight from Hankou to Tianjin to visit him and comfort him, and his mental state recovered as before. On the evening of May this summer, his uncle Xinglin came to Shanghai from Tianjin, which he found out about. After soliciting Xinglin's opinion, he took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyue ship to Shanghai on June 5. It was unexpected that the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, and Peixian disappeared. Whether he jumped into the sea or was murdered by someone remains a mystery. Zhang Wenlin concluded that he himself is a civil servant and unable to spare the time. He initially applied for a month's leave at the beginning of the month to investigate in person, but it has already been exhausted, and the result is as described above, which is truly heartbreaking. If he can borrow your newspaper to disclose the process and recover his son, he will be endlessly grateful.</p>
<p>Guests from Chinese and Foreign Circles at the Cocktail Reception Celebrating United Nations Day</p>
<h3>National Bank Allocates 10,000 Bales of Yarn - To Be Transported to Various Places for Cotton Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the establishment of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office, it has universally implemented fixed-price cotton collection, so the amount of cotton collected by the various branches and stations is very limited. It is reported that cotton prices in various places are generally one to one and a half times higher than the fixed price, while the finished cotton yarn prices are generally two to two and a half times higher than the fixed price. Therefore, starting this week, half of the payment for cotton collection will be in the form of cotton yarn, and half will still be in cash, which should overcome the difficulty of fixed-price cotton collection. It is heard that the Central Bank has allocated 10,000 bales of cotton yarn for cotton exchange, which will soon be transported to various places by the office.</p>
<h3>Popularizing Postal Knowledge - Holding Prize Quizzes</h3>
<p>In order to popularize postal knowledge and increase public interest, the Shanghai Postal Administration will hold postal prize quizzes on Shanghai Radio. There will be a total of five questions. The first five people who answer all questions correctly will each receive a model of a mailbox and two sets of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company commemorative stamps. Those who answer four questions correctly will receive small gifts. The quiz questions will be reported by Chen Shu on Shanghai Radio from 7:00 PM to 7:20 PM tonight and will be broadcast continuously for a week. The station's call sign is XORA, with a frequency of 900 KC. The public is welcome to listen.</p>
<h3>Tricycle Odometer - Huang Pinfa Requests Patent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The tricycle odometer invented by engineer Huang Pinfa of the Xiangfeng Machinery Iron Factory was previously submitted to the Economic Management and Supervision Office for adoption, but there has been no concrete response. Yesterday, Huang submitted separate requests for adoption and trial use to relevant agencies such as the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Municipal Government, attaching a detailed description and a photo of the odometer. At the same time, he entrusted a lawyer and an accountant to apply for a patent with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Leaders from All Walks of Life Discuss - Rice and Coal Supply Problems - Encourage Merchants - To Actively Purchase</h3>
<p>In order to solve the problem of the source of rice and other materials in the city, leaders of various agencies, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, and Yang Chuoan, have repeatedly consulted in recent days. According to Speaker Pan, the most important and urgent problems to be solved in Shanghai at present are the source of rice and coal. In addition to the rationed rice, the city needs rice merchants to supply 200,000 dan per month. However, due to the high prices in the producing areas recently, rice merchants are unwilling to transport it to Shanghai and sell it at the fixed price. Under this circumstance, the government should find ways to encourage merchants to actively purchase rice and transport it to Shanghai. As for coal, because of the traffic obstruction on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, coal from central China cannot be transported. Due to the lack of ships, coal from the north is also in short supply. Currently, it only relies on Huainan coal and Taipei coal, and even public utilities have mobilized safety coal. Last year, I advocated that when coal can be purchased as much as possible in the producing areas, coal merchants should be encouraged to purchase and store as much as possible. Unfortunately, the competent authorities did not consider this at the beginning, so we should quickly seek solutions now, otherwise industrial production will also be greatly affected.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Military Officers to Purchase Oil and Extort - Two Defendants Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment Each - Gu Xiangjiu and Chen Dequan Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Jin Henghong and Shen Yunlong jointly established Hengfeng Firm on Fuzhou Road. They were previously suspected of privately selling allocated diesel. Tao Tongfu and Gu Xiangjiu learned about this in a conversation and conceived a plan to blackmail them. Together with Peng Bingquan, who is still at large, they went to the telephone switchboard room of the Cangzhou Hotel where they were staying and falsely claimed to be borrowing several million yuan, obtaining a blank check from Zhejiang Industrial Bank from Chen Dequan. Then, Peng, using the alias Wang Li, went to Jin Henghong's place to pretend to buy diesel and agreed on a price. He then filled out the aforementioned check with an amount of 488 million yuan and gave it to Jin Henghong on May 31 of this year, obtaining a delivery note for eight tons of diesel from Hengfeng Firm. Although he knew that the check he paid would be dishonored, he believed that Jin Henghong would not dare to make a fuss because he knew that selling oil was illegal. He then gave the delivery note to Wang Tianjian, who went to Hengfeng Firm to pick up the goods on June 21. Jin stated that since the check he received had been dishonored, the original buyer had to be present before the goods could be delivered. Wang insisted in various ways, but without success. He then threatened, "Tomorrow I will invite honored veterans to make trouble," but without success. The next day, Wang and Tao indeed brought several wounded soldiers and went there. Tao, wearing a military uniform and carrying a handgun, threatened Jin in every possible way and threatened to smash up the office, insisting on picking up the goods. Jin politely explained, and Tao also knew that he could not escape achieving his goal and took the initiative to compromise, saying that the delivery note held by Wang was a pledge received for a loan of 60 million legal currency. If Jin was willing to compensate for the loss of 60 million yuan, the delivery note could be returned. He agreed to meet Jin at No. 1000 Lanzhou Road again that afternoon. When Jin arrived as agreed, Wang again wore a military uniform, put on the rank of colonel, and insisted that Jin should compensate for the loss of 60 million yuan before returning the delivery note. Jin insisted that the buyer had to be present before he would compensate for the loss. The two sides insisted, but without success. They agreed to talk on the phone again on the 23rd. On that day, Wang and Tao invited several wounded soldiers and pre-arranged them on the seventh floor of No. 264 Jiangxi Road, and invited Jin to talk again by phone. Jin was frightened and reported to the Songhu Garrison Command, which dispatched plainclothes officers to accompany him. Wang and Tao and several wounded soldiers were arrested on the spot. Then Gu Xiangjiu and Chen Dequan were arrested. Apart from the wounded soldiers who had military status and were to be tried by military law, the rest were transferred by the Municipal Police Department to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against Tao and the other three on charges of intimidation and other crimes. The case was recently concluded and sentenced by Judge Cao Zuzhao of the District Court: Tao Tongfu and Wang Tianjian, with the common intention of illegally obtaining property for themselves, attempted to cause others to deliver property by intimidation, and were each sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Gu Xiangjiu and Chen Dequan were both found not guilty. Tao and Wang, the two defendants, were taken into custody in court.</p>

Therefore, they were specially granted amnesty. Sun and others also bribed military police, but because the crime was minor, the prosecutor, in consideration of Sino-Korean relations, officially ruled that the entire case would not be prosecuted yesterday.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Liu Rulin from Xinghua, who lives on a boat in Tushanwan, Xujiahui, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., Liu's eight-year-old son, Du Erxiaozi, and seven-year-old daughter, Liu Xiuyun, went ashore to pick up old things nearby. They happened to go to the bottom of the electric pole numbered 52714 in the south of the Pudong Road District Office. The electric wire above had fallen down. The two children, unaware of the danger, took the wire with their hands, resulting in electric shock. Erxiaozi died on the spot, and Xiuyun suffered burns on her arms and right foot. After someone reported to the Xujiahui Police Branch, which has jurisdiction over the area, they sent officers to transport the injured girl to the nearby Baoning Hospital for treatment and sent the boy's body to the Tongren Fuyuantang for examination.</p>

<h3>General Prices The Phenomenon of Panic Buying is Superficially Relatively Quiet All Parties Seem to Be Waiting for an Opportunity to Change</h3>
<p>The market situation this week has not improved since the previous week. Those who have stopped trading are still stopping, and those who have not started are still not starting. The trend seems to be waiting for new government measures to reverse this situation. Before the government has new measures, there does not seem to be any major change in the short term. The phenomenon of panic buying has been relatively quiet. This is partly because merchants have hidden goods and partly because of various restrictions on buying with ID cards, but we must never think that everyone's psychology of panic buying has subsided. The financial market has also gradually had new reactions this week. Credit has tightened, and black market interest rates have frequently risen, reaching more than two jiao. Customers have been withdrawing cash, and deposits in banks have plummeted. It is estimated that the total amount of deposits in banks at the end of September was about 250 million yuan, and the current total amount of deposits has been reduced to about 50 million yuan. Prices in other major cities across the country have risen sharply. To take into account the actual difficulties, some local governments have allowed adjustments to the August 19th price limits for a few important commodities. In addition, the central authorities ordered the Import and Export Management Committee to abolish the price limit for tung oil in order to promote exports and earn foreign exchange, and to implement price negotiations at the place of production. As for the price reduction standards, the selling price at the place of production should be negotiated based on foreign prices, minus various expenses and legal profits. In recent days, the authorities have held several important meetings on the price issue. However, the attendees are all tight-lipped about the content of the meetings. The future of price limits is still unknown!</p>
<p>As for the authorities' views on the current price problem and the analysis of the reasons for the rise, we can use the reports of Mr. Weng Wenhao and Mr. Wang Yunwu in the Legislative Yuan for explanation. Mr. Weng Wenhao said that the current abnormal situation is caused by four factors: (1) Military relations have a great impact on people's hearts, (2) Communist bandits' sabotage, (3) Price limits in some areas are too low, (4) Speculation. Mr. Wang Yunwu's report divides the price fluctuations in various places into three periods for explanation: (1) Prices before August 19th rose wildly. (2) From August 19th to the end of September, due to the issuance of gold yuan coupons, general prices stabilized, and even partially fell. (3) Fluctuations began at the end of September, and the fluctuations became more obvious in October, resulting in today's phenomenon. Mr. Wang believes that there are many reasons for price fluctuations, such as the disturbances of communist bandits, changes in the military situation, temporary failures in the supply of goods, and people's psychological anxiety. Finally, Mr. Wang put forward four remedial measures to address the current situation: (1) Increase production, (2) Economize consumption, (3) Dredge materials, (4) Control floating capital.</p>
<p>Under the aforementioned four points, Mr. Wang, in order to make up for some loopholes in the emergency financial and economic measures and stabilize the current economic situation, further formulated a complete implementation plan. According to United News Agency, the content of the plan includes the following parts: (1) Tighten the issuance of gold yuan coupons and find ways to bring them back. (2) Make good use of the financial foreign exchange collected. (3) Reasonably adjust prices, but still strictly implement the price limit policy. (4) The prices of state-owned transportation and public utility businesses will be restored to pre-war standards, and the government will stop subsidizing them. (5) Improve the treatment of public school teachers and staff. (6) Absorb floating capital. (7) Expand rationing and coupon sales. (8) Control prices and regulate the supply and demand between production areas and markets. (9) Strengthen comprehensive economic control and thoroughly eliminate the existence of the black market. (10) Crack down on smuggling and the outflow of funds to the south. (11) Open up loans and strengthen production.</p>
<p>This Mr. Wang's new plan, which is still being formulated, includes a wide range of content. Judging from these few outlines, the inherent difficulties and self-contradictory handling are inevitable.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, since the panic buying week occurred and the supply of goods on the market was short, the authorities have become more active in promoting the quantitative distribution system. It has now been decided to implement a household economic survey to issue new national ID cards, along with 144 purchase coupons, which can be used to buy about 12 kinds of goods such as rice, oil, briquettes, and sugar per month, and will be used up in one year. Each purchase coupon is printed with a number and the name of the goods that can be purchased. The goods that can be purchased at what time will be announced at any time. As for the targets, it is said that public school teachers and staff are for rationing, and citizens are for purchase. The quantity of goods is stipulated as one dou of rice per month, one catty of oil per month, half a catty of sugar per month, two dan of briquettes per month, and one zhang and five chi of cloth every six months. We know that the quantitative distribution system is the most effective way to implement thrift. This method has been most successful in the UK. However, it also has several prerequisites that should be resolved, such as the control of a large amount of goods and the continuous supply; the determination of the price of rationed goods must take into account the production costs and the burden of consumers; the strictness of social organizations, the detailed household survey; the high work efficiency of the staff, and so on. Implementing a quantitative distribution system is an arduous task. If this time it can be done well, it will be a big step for the country towards modernization.</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai district management authorities, in order to strengthen the regulation and supply of goods, invited representatives from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai to hold an enlarged meeting in Shanghai to discuss the exchange of goods between the three provinces and two cities. After discussion, the Shanghai city side agreed to transport cloth, yarn, sugar, soap, and Huorong to various provinces. Jiangsu Province agreed to supply Shanghai with cotton, rice, and wheat, Zhejiang Province agreed to supply hemp and tung oil, and Anhui Province agreed to supply food rice and vegetable by-products.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Dynamics</p>
<h3>The Troublesome Issue of Expanding the Supply of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Last week, the shortage of raw materials and fuel in the industrial and commercial circles of this city did not show any significant reduction. Taking coal as an example, it is estimated that the monthly demand in the Beijing and Shanghai regions is 350,000 tons. In winter, due to heat, the demand doubles, but the current output of each supply area is at most 214,000 tons per month. In addition, the war zone has expanded, and transportation has been blocked, which naturally causes more problems in transportation. If the shortage of raw materials and fuel is not smoothly resolved one day, the reduction in industrial and commercial production will also have no end.</p>
<p>In order to actively promote the work of regulating the supply of goods, the Shanghai District Commodity Regulation Committee held a meeting last Tuesday and decided to establish three small groups as soon as possible, including industrial raw materials, fuel, and daily necessities, so as to promote various businesses.</p>
<p>Originally, there are only a few ways to resolve the shortage of raw materials and fuel. The first is to actively purchase from relevant production areas in the country. For example, for the purchase of raw cotton, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office has branches in various parts of the country on the 16th of this month. Fully launch the purchase work. But it is said that this work is quite difficult due to the price limit. Therefore, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office can only take the method of matching yarn and cloth to the cotton area for price exchange to solve the difficulty of purchase under the price limit. At the same time, in order to maintain the joint purchase policy and avoid competitive purchase, the office also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order the provincial governments of the cotton-producing areas to strictly prohibit various yarn factories from engaging in the purchase by exchanging yarn for cotton alone. This can be said to be maintaining a trust organization. If the "price" of the so-called "matching yarn and cloth for price exchange" is still far below the reproduction cost of raw cotton, then in the long run, it is obviously damaging the productivity of raw cotton. This point must be noticed by the authorities. In addition, there are still many difficulties in the purchase of raw cotton. According to the East China News Agency, it is learned that in the sound of national cotton purchase, the problem of transporting the cotton that has been collected has not been thoroughly resolved so far, which is indeed a fatal injury to the purchase work. Obviously, the more the war expands, the more problems there are in transportation. It can be seen that the supply of raw cotton is by no means simply solved by economic problems.</p>
<p>The second method to resolve the shortage of raw materials and fuel is to expand imports from abroad. For example, the method of opening up goods that have been paid for recently announced by the Executive Yuan is one of the specific steps. It is estimated that if this method can take effect, then goods worth 50 million US dollars left in Hong Kong can be imported, which will help alleviate the shortage of raw materials. However, according to news from the financial community, whether the self-prepared foreign exchange goods left in Hong Kong can be imported depends on whether the domestic financial situation becomes more balanced. Obviously, if the imported raw materials must face the risk of being purchased at a price limit, then the so-called partial opening of self-prepared foreign plants is still not very strong. As for the expansion of fuel imports, it seems that the authorities are also trying to find ways. According to the report of the director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the municipal finance authorities have agreed with the Central Bank to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to order 50,000 tons of foreign coal to solve the problem of coal for public utilities in many seasons. However, this method must not be regarded as the government's preparation to subsidize public utilities, because when the Industry Group of the Commodity Regulation Committee held a meeting last Wednesday, the representatives attending the Central Bank stated that the authorities lacked foreign exchange for importing industrial raw materials. Therefore, the Supervisory Office plans to allocate 20 million US dollars in foreign exchange for the China Trust Bureau to import raw materials. "The Central Bank has not received an order," etc. It can be seen that if it is believed that the government has recently received a lot of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, so it can be used for the import of raw materials, it is obviously a too naive idea.</p>
<p>The third method to resolve the shortage of raw materials and fuel is only for the industrial and commercial circles to "rely on their own efforts". "Wool comes from the sheep's back," which is also the easiest way. Therefore, the result of the meeting of the Industry Group of the Commodity Regulation Committee last Thursday was to decide that the raw materials needed for rubber and papermaking should be preferentially supplied to the rubber and papermaking industries based on the quantity of goods reported by the commercial firms in this city. By analogy, especially for raw materials that are slightly processed, the government will probably adopt the method of "getting it from the left hand and taking it away from the right hand" on a large scale, acting as an "introducer" for various industries. However, the problem has not been thoroughly resolved. Relying solely on this method to deal with the shortage of raw materials and fuel, the panic will still come. In a helpless situation, the thrift movement will inevitably be proposed. For example, taking coal as an example, according to the Dagong News Agency, the authorities are planning to implement a more stringent coal-saving campaign, asking citizens to restrain the use of coal for heating, and prohibiting the use of hot water heaters in large buildings, offices, public places, dance halls, theaters, etc. Naturally, just like not allowing meat on Tuesdays, this is just the beginning. Winter—an extraordinary winter, it seems that more than five million citizens will have to grit their teeth and endure the torment of hunger and cold!</p>

<h3>Various Provinces Increase the Number of Universities; Order Issued to Stop Requests to Change to National Status; Boycotts and Petitions to Protect Schools are Extremely Harmful</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Masses News Agency] The Ministry of Education recently noted that in recent years, various provincial governments and public opinion organizations, often disregarding the financial resources of their respective provinces, have requested to increase the number of higher education institutions under the guise of promoting education and cultivating talent, as well as providing relief to unemployed youth. Once the Ministry of Education approves their proposal, they then request to change the institution to national status, without considering the true purpose. Consequently, staff and students rise up in protest, even boycotting classes and petitioning to protect the school. This has become a common practice, which is extremely harmful. The ministry has specially requested the Executive Yuan to issue an order to stop this practice.</p>

<h3>The Large Pancake and Other Things</h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>Because of thrift and economic limitations, the large pancake and fried dough sticks have become my main breakfast every day. But when I went to buy it as usual this morning, I couldn't buy it. When asked why, the answer was: there is no flour, so it cannot be made. Judging from the situation, the pancake stall owner didn't seem to be lying, so I had to return home disappointed.</p>
<p>Because I was a little disappointed, I thought of unpleasant things. Also, because this disappointment happened because I couldn't buy a large pancake, I also thought of the news I accidentally saw a few days ago that a certain pancake stall owner committed suicide because he couldn't buy flour, couldn't do business, and his wife was sick. (I have forgotten the name and location, because at that time I still had large pancakes to eat, so I "regarded it indifferently"; fortunately, it was not important.)</p>
<p>This news was of course just a very small headline, printed in the corner of the newspaper. Naturally, not many people paid attention to it, and those who saw it didn't take it seriously. But now, because it is a bit related to myself, I not only don't have the fluttering feeling I had when I read the newspaper at that time, but also think that this problem is a bit serious, although the reason why this problem is serious is still my own feeling.</p>
<p>In fact, from a distance and a big picture, isn't this a serious social problem!</p>
<p>The suicide of a certain pancake stall owner was motivated by "his wife's illness." However, the word "again" immediately follows the previous sentence "unable to do business." Therefore, if there "was" flour and he "could" do business, even if "his wife" was ill, the owner would not have committed suicide. It is obvious. Based on this, the suicide of the owner was of course because he was unable to do business.</p>
<p>Unable to do business is the same as being unemployed. The inability to operate a pancake stall affects only the owner, since the scale is small and doesn't necessarily employ workers, and only affects people like me who eat large pancakes. It is natural to want to hum a line of "the people are exhausted" to vent a little bit of complaint.</p>
<p>However, if the scope of inability to operate expands, the problem will not be so simple. Watching with a cold eye, this trend does not seem to be impossible to realize.</p>
<p>Now, the large and small shops in this city can be said to be bustling with customers, but aren't the goods displayed very few? Hoarding is certainly one reason for this phenomenon, but I always suspect that in addition to hoarding, some people are also hiding. Customers are hoarding, and owners are hiding, and the latter are hoarding more fiercely than the former. Because of the simultaneous "hoarding," many shops have become monsters with gaping mouths.</p>
<p>For example, before the tax increase, cigarettes were in short supply everywhere. Once the price was adjusted, goods immediately "poured in" and everything was available. But in the past few days, they have been in short supply everywhere again. The result of the authorities' investigation is that manufacturers and wholesalers are shrugging off responsibility? Taking one example as a lesson, I suspect that many commodities are being manipulated so that they "cannot be operated."</p>
<p>If this kind of "inability to operate" expands, there will definitely be people who will make a fortune from "inability" (because we had war fortunes and victory fortunes in the past, so now we might as well invent the name "inability fortune" to form a three-legged situation, which is quite grand). However, these "people" are only a minority. The majority of salaried people will probably be unemployed due to the pretense of inability to operate by a few bosses, which will further turn into unwillingness to operate, and then a complete closure. This is not as simple as the inability of a pancake stall to operate.</p>
<p>If, unfortunately, this large group of unemployed people increases in the future, what will happen?</p>
<p>Because I didn't get to eat a large pancake for a day, I said a lot of nonsense above, which inevitably makes the carefree people of the optimistic school see me as "hysterical," and I am very willing that this is my own "hysteria." Because if it's just my own "hysteria," only I will feel panic. A杞人憂天 person is worried about everything, and it is all self-inflicted suffering!</p>
<p>As the saying goes: A single spark can start a prairie fire. I hope that the inability of the pancake stall to operate is just a very short-term accidental bubble, not only not a single spark, but not even fire at all.</p>
<h3>Lining Up</h3>
<p>— Tong Tuo</p>
<p>I have experienced a severe test of lining up once in my life, when I took the train back to my hometown during the enemy-puppet period. At that time, to buy a train ticket, you had to ask someone you knew for help and offer a price several times higher than the ticket price to get it. Of course, if you took this ticket and wanted to get on the train, you had to line up to pass through the ticket gate. At that time, braving the cold wind of December, I rushed to the station early in the morning and saw a long line like a copper wall. I squeezed in at the end of the line. In less than five minutes, I looked back and saw a lot of people squeezing behind me.</p>
<p>At this time, the ticket gate had not yet started working. The long line was getting tighter and tighter, pushing and shoving, and it was almost impossible to breathe comfortably. There were also shouts from the police and the threatening sound of rattan whips waving in the air—it was really uncomfortable. When I passed through the ticket gate and rushed out of the small gap, I actually squeezed out a body of sweat in the cold wind, from the inner shirt soaked with sweat to the cotton-padded jacket, with sweat beads all over my head, almost like midsummer. The most profound impression of the suffering of lining up in my life was that time, which I will never forget. The hatred for lining up also took root at that time—because this is not like lining up, it is simply a battle of life and death.</p>
<p>In fact, there is nothing wrong with lining up. In order to maintain order among the crowded people, there is no other way but to line up. It's just that today's world is in chaos, and lining up has become a symbol of a deteriorating situation. For example, we used to get household rice by rationed tickets and could go to buy it calmly within the specified validity period. But recently, there is no rice in the rice shops, and household rice also has to be obtained by looting, so it is inevitable to line up.</p>
<p>After the rice is solved, vegetables also have to be lined up, buying meat, buying fish... as long as it belongs to meat, you have to line up. Housewives have to line up in order to solve the day's meals. It is true that one bowl of porridge and one meal should be thought of as hard-won. Lowering the standard, even buying jewelry lottery tickets also requires lining up and looting, which shows how people's lives are in a state of panic today!</p>
<p>Since lining up is无可厚非, we have to choose among them. Why follow the crowd and spend our lives lining up everywhere? For example, those who have no food at home need to line up for household rice, but if they don't eat fish and meat, they still have vegetables. Why wait from dawn until sunset for a pound of meat and a fish? The top prize of the jewelry lottery ticket is indeed enviable, but thinking of the one in 600,000 chance, I feel that it is a waste of life to line up to buy a lottery ticket. I don't think this argument will affect the sales of lottery tickets, because as of the time I am writing, I heard that the lottery tickets have been sold out.</p>
<p>I would rather waste the effort of meaningless lining up to exercise, because many lining up results are futile. Once I saw a couple going to the cinema to line up to buy movie tickets. When it was their turn to reach the window, a sign had already been hung out saying "Tickets are sold out, please come early tomorrow." The couple had to return in disappointment. Don't you think this kind of lining up is disappointing?</p>
<h3>Talking About Wine</h3>
<p>— Old Man Semi-Dream</p>
<p>In order to increase luxury goods taxes, the government first increased the taxes on cigarettes and alcohol by more than 70%, so cigarettes and alcohol were allowed to increase in price by more than double, breaking the August 19th fixed price. Cigarettes and alcohol are both stimulating and contain slight toxins, but many people are addicted to them and unconsciously fall into their trap and cannot extricate themselves. Cigarettes are not discussed here. As for alcohol, the ancients called it "掃愁帶" [belt to sweep away sorrow] and "釣詩鈎" [hook to fish for poetry]. Ordinary people use alcohol as a "belt to sweep away sorrow," while writers use alcohol as a "hook to fish for poetry." Li Bai's hundred poems with a斗 [unit of dry measure] of alcohol is a representative of a poet who "fishes for poetry."</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting colder, and alcohol is gradually raising its head. Although the price of alcohol has doubled, those who indulge in drinking do not feel it at all. There is a liquor store near me that sells all kinds of wines, such as rose wine, Wujiapi wine, grape wine, Buddha's hand wine, bayberry wine, old wine and new wine, Huadiao wine and Taidiao wine, and also all kinds of foreign wines, with colorful advertising paper stuck on black bottles, displayed in glass cabinets, which is very beautiful. Many drinkers can't help but salivate when they pass by. If they have money on them, they pour a glass on the counter and start to taste it while standing. After one glass is finished, they come for another glass, no matter if their face is red and their heart is fluttering, as if the country and the world have nothing to do with them. Even if they come out and fall on the side of the road, it doesn't matter, anyway, bury me on the spot. The ancients also had precedents, so what's wrong with following the example? They also say that living in this era is meaningless. We can't be corrupt, and there is no way to get rich. No one praises us for being honest all our lives. It's all the same to live drunk and dream of death, and to die drunk and dream of life. I often see people like this. When they are drunk, I go over and talk to them. There are foreigners and Chinese. I don't understand foreign languages, but if the Chinese are old, they often have a kind of experience and deep sorrow. Digging it up is really full of emotion.</p>
<p>Therefore, he uses alcohol as a "belt to sweep away sorrow," and I can't help but use the words of the drinker as my "hook to fish for poetry." My friend Mu Jushi said: "Half is poetry crazy and half is alcohol crazy, one song and one toast, both eliminating cold and avoiding heat are as desired, drunk and high-pitched chanting has a different heart." He also said: "Sometimes having alcohol is not a good plan, having alcohol without poetry is also boring, poetry comes from nature and is written drunk, alcohol meets friendship and pours out feelings." I said: "Who knows Li Bai's madness throughout the ages, a hundred poems with a斗 of alcohol holding a pot, using poetry as a side dish to add flavor to poetry, talking about poetry with alcohol to moisten the intestines. Du Mu climbed the tower and drank more, Tao Qian supported his staff and forgot each other in drunkenness. Let the earth be turned upside down, one song is full of brocade bags." After all, it's a bit sour, so I'll stop writing here.</p>
<h3>Talking About Fengqiao</h3>
<p>— Hou Xi</p>
<p>Many famous places give us a more lovely impression from the words that have been passed down than the actual scenery. Often, when you are there, you feel that there is nothing to be gained, and you can't help but secretly blame the predecessors for being too good at using words to exaggerate so well. Like "Hanshan Temple outside Gusu City," how beautiful is the scene conveyed to us from Zhang Ji's poem "Night Mooring at Fengqiao" from the Tang Dynasty! There are many people who admire it and go there, but 19 out of 10 think it is not worth a visit, and only get a rubbing of Zhang Ji's poem stele and return.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang Ji's poem title is "Night Mooring at Fengqiao," which describes the surrounding scenery and reveals the inner emotions, not the Hanshan Temple. When the moon has set, the birds are crowing, and the frost is all over the sky, facing the maple forest and fishing lights, unable to sleep with sorrow, the temple bell reaches the pillow, and a quiet chant is formed. The feeling of being a guest permeates the bones of the poem, and only the two words "sorrowful sleep" wake up the whole poem. When I was a child, I saw in a book that "sorrowful sleep" was interpreted as the name of a stone, which was the most peculiar. Some people also pointed out that there was no bell ringing in the middle of the night, and others came out to give examples to refute, which also felt very tasteless.</p>
<p>A poet captures the emotion of a moment and a place to complete a creation. We understand and interpret it from different angles, only seeking to be not far away, so why bother to wear凿附会! The scenes and artistic conception expressed in Zhang Ji's poem, as well as the rhythm and color of the poem, can give us a kind of infection. It is also a knowing appreciation for those who admire Hanshan Temple because of this poem. As for returning in disappointment, then blame yourself for being too stubborn and not blaming the Tang Dynasty for doing a tourist advertising poem for the monks of Hanshan Temple. Moreover, going to the temple to visit the stele in a superficial way will certainly not get any good results. Even if you hire a boat and support it to Fengqiao for the night, although it is the time of frost, I am afraid that you may not be able to practice the artistic conception of the poem, and as a result, it is most likely that you will win a sleepless night.</p>
<p>I remember in the autumn of the 15th year, I had something to do and went to Suzhou by water. The boat passed Fengqiao, and I pushed the cabin to look at it. There were wild bushes, weeds, and the setting sun was in a mess. The water was sad, and the bridge was silent. I made a special trip to the shore to see Hanshan Temple to relieve my depression, but I didn't write a poem. Perhaps the sense of oppression that "Cui Hao wrote a poem on top" was not without reason. When I settled in Suzhou, I went out several times, passed Fengqiao, went to Tianping Mountain, and also took a break at Hanshan Temple; tourists enter the temple, not to listen to the bell, but to see the bell. But the ancient bell of the Tang Dynasty was taken to Japan long ago, and its whereabouts are still being searched for.</p>
<p>Du Mu's poem says: "I will never forget the time of parting, the evening smoke and autumn rain pass Fengqiao." This is another Fengqiao in the writing of a Tang Dynasty person. There are many poems written by later generations, but it seems that the writing is too intentional, and there are few that are worth seeing.</p>
<p>Fengqiao has its own beauty, so don't hold on to the "成竹" [ready-made plan] of "the moon has set, the crows are crowing, and the frost is all over the sky" to check the poetic materials. So I still think of Fengqiao sometimes, but unfortunately I didn't moor by the bridge at night. I rushed to Hengtang that night when I passed by that year. But why do you have to moor at night? I suspect that I have also made the mistake of "carving a boat to seek a sword."</p>
<p>Shu Fan asks for the title of Mr. Huang Huimu's Chengni Inkstone Yao Chu</p>
<p>The Fen River flows with thousands of pounds of force, breaking the dragon's teeth and cutting the dragon's spine, leaving only a piece of fish yellow to match Mr.'s water pit red. The scholar stepped up for righteousness in a hurry, and the women and children in the garden rushed to the enemy. Outside the White Cloud Village, there was a lot of noise, and after nine deaths, he still had a flute around his waist. Since ancient times, loyalty and righteousness are inherent in human nature, and generosity and calmness are originally a single line. Dazhou's memorial to the stars peeks through the window, and the feather summons the soul with bamboo splitting stone. It is conceivable that when Dao Yan built the camp, he carved his liver as paper and blood as a barrier. In the evening, he stored tears and wrote about the remnant mountains. Who knew that he had drafted a declaration before the army? Three hundred years have passed since the fall of the Ming Dynasty, and the secluded light has never gone out, just like the silk bag coming out of the Chengni, which cannot be eroded by the waves. Taihang is the same body as Wan Die, and it is really virtuous to suppress the four directions. If you are allowed to pass through Guan Cheng, the Eji general can be given the title. In the past, Wu was determined to be a hero, and he ran to Youbing in despair. He lived with his mother for a generation, and the ancient appearance was only passed down with white pupils. If you want to use relics to be proud of Yuyao, try to find the old bird in Qiandun. (The abandoned shoes of Mr. Tinglin's former residence in Qiandun, Kunshan, still exist.)</p>
<h3>Talking About Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>Although chrysanthemums are talked about by elegant literati and scholars, and ordinary people who consider themselves to be hermits always praise themselves for their noble feelings by picking and appreciating chrysanthemums, in fact, the potted chrysanthemums in today's cities have long been manipulated by people and lost the old state of living in seclusion with people.</p>
<p>The real chrysanthemums that accompany wild people in the mountains are the yellow wild chrysanthemums in the mountains and fields. Their flower shape is small and simple, and the varieties are different. They can usually bloom from the end of summer to the end of winter, distributed from the plains to the high mountains, from the temperate zone to the cold zone. They are not only not afraid of wind and frost, but also resistant to ice and snow. Even some stubborn species can live in extremely dry barren cliffs or deserts, enduring climate differences, and struggling at any time, showing its toughness. This is the yellow flower in our ideal, and it can also represent the gentlemen who work hard silently in the dark society. It is only appropriate to praise these not very famous members of the chrysanthemum family to conform to the way of appreciating chrysanthemums today. Only those nameless yellow flowers are the real ones that decorate the autumn wilderness, making the earth more beautiful and giving the public the feeling of autumn.</p>
<p>In addition, I can't help but think of the pyrethrum cultivated by experts in the fields. Although they have the name of chrysanthemum, they are not only for pure appreciation, but also have the effect of removing insects. This is just like the martyrs and gentlemen who worked hard to criticize the adverse currents and eliminate the masses of ugly people in the dark period. Their being valued by experts is just like the gentlemen of the past dynasties being valued by historians. It is also thanks to him that he has the courage to prevent and eliminate pests, which invisibly reduces a lot of damage to the entire biological world. Therefore, he is not only worthy of "appreciation," but also worthy of attention and cultivation. I hereby propose this pyrethrum that matches the upright gentlemen to discuss with chrysanthemum appreciators. I wonder if he can be commented on in the future?</p>

<h3>Legal Q&amp;A: Question on Redemption of Pawned House</h3>
<p>[Question from Mr. Zhang Yangzhi] I have a house (in Shaoxing) that was pawned in the 27th year of the Republic of China for a term of ten years, which has now expired. However, the pawnee lives in Hangzhou and I do not know his detailed address. What kind of procedures should I use to obtain the property rights? Please give me an answer in your column!</p>
<p>[Answer from Mr. Ying Mingshi] According to Article 923 of the Civil Code: If the pawnor does not redeem the pawn at the original pawn price after two years from the expiration of the pawn term, the pawnee will obtain ownership of the pawned property. According to the question, the house was pawned in the 27th year and the ten-year term has now expired, so you must not be negligent and suffer losses. Since you know that the pawnee is in Hangzhou, you can announce the redemption; if it is still invalid, you can deposit it with the court. If you proceed according to the usual procedure, you can file a lawsuit for redemption and serve it by public announcement.</p>
