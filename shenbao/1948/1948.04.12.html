<p>暢談兩種主義的鬥爭</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕廣西大學旅京校友會於十一，日在靑年一部大禮堂舉行茶會，招待李宗仁一主任，到黃旭初，李運華，雷殷一，陳劍條等百餘人。李氏即席發表演講，略稱廣西大學係艱苦困難之中創立長成，但未達到理想的程度。渠稱：「本人對敎育事業，夙極注重；民十七年在武漢政治分會主席任內，在財政極度困難中，曾撥二十萬元作爲武漢大學之開辦費，湘·鄂兩省銀行，亦爲當時設法籌撥款項乃得成立者。由此足證明本人從來對敎育文化及經濟之建設事業，決不忽視。」李氏繼述廣西對北伐抗之貢獻後，關於今後中李氏認定應以軍事爲治標，以政治經濟之改革爲治本，並謂；「此項改革必須中央做起，因此中央負責者，不僅應具有改革之決心，更應有正確適宜之方案。本人參加副總統競選之動機，一爲倡導民主風氣，同時爲基於對國家之責任感，願以個入三十餘年從事軍政工作之經驗，輔助元首，由中央着手，來從事澈底之改革。本人如能獲選副總統，即願作爲人民與政府之橋樑，使各方面之意見，能轉達元首，以供採擇。」李氏繼稱：「對共匪之鬥爭，非單純之軍事鬥爭，而爲一種政治鬥爭，亦即三民主義與共產主義之門爭，因之吾人如不能實行三民主義，則雖戰勝共匪亦不能獲取有發一致之支持；如以民生主義而論，平均地權，節制資本兩事，今日不特未能實行，豪門資本乘機崛起，積成巨富，使中國社會由大貧小貧之分，變為貧者益貧，富者愈富之現象，故今天非清算豪門資本，不足以平民憤，不足以表示政府改革經濟之決心。本人並相信此種政治與經濟之改革運動，旣爲全國一致之要求，則必然可以成功，必然可以由政治經濟之改革，而達到戡亂建國之目的。」最後李氏分析今後國際局勢謂，中國今後對外之方針，必須把握住獨立自主之原則，對內必須肅淸共匪，保持中國之不赤化，進而作爲保障亞洲安全之中流砥柱。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　楊炳森</p>
<p>〔本報保定八日航訊〕在今天河北是一個非常局面，省政工作實在是千頭萬緒，可是現在已有了一點曙光，知道如何着手工作。河北省主席楚溪春，認淸了省政的癥結所在，才敢於有自信，即知即行。記得兩個多月前楚氏就職之際，他自先就宣佈了一個最低限度的最切實扼要的省政實施鋼領。第一件中心省政工作，是以政治全力來配軍事開展，並曾强調的說：行政設施的目標是人民，權利應屬於人民，利益應歸於人民，我們要以軍事推動政治，以政治鞏固人民力量　而以人民力量求面的開展，以面的　　養　點綫，再以點綫支持全面，分途並進。</p>
<p>軍政配合</p>
<p>軍政配合的主要課題，是以正規軍支持地方團隊，以地方團隊支持人民自衛組織，即以人民自衛力量配合地方團隊，以團隊支持正規軍，相互循環配合，來消滅共匪，在組訓民衆方面，要作到有事皆兵，無事皆民的地步．在行政無條件全力配合軍事的原則下，除正規軍外，省府計劃全省成立廿二個保安團，其中經費三分之二由中央補給，三分之一由地方自籌，此外在督察專員區內成立游剿隊，負責指揮保安團隊實行游擊剿匪任務，在各縣中成立淸剿隊，担任縣區內部淸除殘匪工作，不予游動。至於鄕村基層組織中，則成立人民自衛隊，但不使其脫離生產，目前的冀省行政正在全力積極向這方面展開工作·</p>
<p>土地檢討</p>
<p>為了針對共匪的「土地政策」，「總虫政策」，冀當局以組織對組織，而運用人民與方法展開了「耕者有其田」及「難民墾荒運動」的土地政策。日前冀軍政檢討會上決定收復區逐步實行民生政策，首先從分配土地着手，刻已在各縣普遍設立「地權平均委員會」負責執行但該會係完全由自耕農及佃農組成，辦理曾經非法處理之土地東予分配雖在原則上保留地主所有權，但除有自耕能力者外，其他均分配予佃農，幷發行土地債券，由政府擔保，佃農於十五年或廿年內償淸地價，但無利息，惟未參加剿匪工作的地主，則不再承認其所有權，而收歸公有，工礦亦將由工人參加管理，幷取得利潤，確實要做到保陣中層，扶植下層，限制上層，俾使貧者富，富者安，而共同致力於生產。</p>
<p>難民懇荒</p>
<p>同時，冀省府為了澈底救濟流亡難民，消滅共匪的「蝗虫政策」而促使難民從事生產，巳決定發勸難民墾荒運動，日來　救濟協會，竊社會處己與河北墾業農塲，及冀省農田局洽妥，決分別在津東茶淀，軍　城　地，各指撥熟荒一萬畝。凡省轄各縣流亡難民，而具有農業生產技術的良民，均可參加此項懇荒工作，并在北平。天津·保定·唐山·四地，擇定三千戶，分批運往兩地，交由難民組成合作農塲。其辦法（一）難民到達地點後，主管方面即借撥廟宇·學校·空房居住，（二）難民請領地畝，暫以每人五畝，或每戶十畝爲限，（三）請領耕地者，可獲得永佃權，惟必須參加自力耕作，不得倔工或轉租他人，此外更貨給農具，配發需用生產原料。</p>
<p>春荒挽救</p>
<p>連年的匪患，冀省農村普遍鬧着嚴重的春荒，日前冀臨參會議長劉瑤章曾視察平漢·北寗兩路及平郊視察，地公開的說：如果今年的春耕問題（包括壯丁·牲畜，農具·肥料·種籽·及生產費用）不設法解決，相信明年的糧食恐慌必然加倍嚴車，人民生活要不堪設想。他認爲目前正應該趕快把集中都市或縣城的壯丁疏散回去從事生產，幷且中央與地方應共同設法在牲畜·農具·肥料·種籽及生產費用各方面儘量予以救濟或補助，此外，再利用工賑方式從事掘并及開渠工作。</p>
<p>冀省府為澈底挽救春荒，刻正積極辦理農貸棉貸，本年度全省農貸已經核准由農行貸款二三〇五億，另由中央合作金庫發放一〇一五億，內以七五〇億作為食糧生產貸款，一千億為棉貸，小型水利一四〇億，其他農業生產及土地放款等，共四一五億。</p>
<p>動力把握</p>
<p>傅作義將軍最近會很剴切的說：目前河北局勢，雖甚嚴重，但我們幷不悲觀，從另一方面看，也正是一個發展的機會，只要我們能把握住新發展的動力。新發展的力量在那裏呢？那就是人民，在匪區，要俠着軍政配合的力量去拯救民衆，在國軍地區，要力求地方安定，省府必須基於人民的要求，人民的利益來求發展，所以目前的河北省政，莫不以全力爭取人民的信愛，發動人民的一切力量，來從事戡亂剿匪的工作。</p>

<h3 id="c24">專論　論自力探險的重要 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 劉咸</p>
<p>自實諾潛逃返美的滑稽演出之後，我國學術界對此均表示憤慨，而主張自力完成積石山的探險工作；中央航空公司亦願無代價由上海或南京派專機一架至蘭州，載運探險人員及探測器材飛往積石山，藉以完成雷諾探險隊的未覺工作。但終因事實上的困難，自行探測的計劃，不得不暫時放棄，我國探險團團員也已陸續自　州返抵南京，吾人對於此事，不得不表示遣憾；而希望我們科學界繼續努力。筆者對於自力探險，早有所主張；並希望以後能擴大自力探險的範圍，願就此一問題向中國科學界進一言。</p>
<p>當本年一月下旬，所謂「雷諾探險隊」來華之初，筆者以事出突兀，行徑不類，曾本科學家之立塲，作一「論雷諾探險隊之來華」一文，刋載於本報二月二日之星期論壇，首先指陳該隊組織之不健全，性質目的欠明瞭，行程日期之朱確定，隊員配合，物資取給，均無妥善準備，倉卒東來，大言不慚，早料其「難免不臨時價事」。次論雷諾爲一筆商，素無探險經歷，來華之後，交接所及，處處爲「原子筆」作宣傳，因而確認「該隊實具有濃厚之商業廣吿色彩，而非純粹之科學探險可知」。最後，更例舉以前外人來華之探險隊，以「不邀守協定，或我國法律，發生糾紛」者，比比皆是，杜漸防徵，愼之於始。管　之見，未免杞憂，亦冀藉此喚起我國科學當局之注意，一得之愚，別無作用，乃未蒙明察，轉承朋好傳言，謂「事關中美科學合作，不悉內容者，幸毋妄評」云云。竊以當茲民主時期，言論自由，載在憲章，人之愛國，誰不如我，「不許百姓點燈」，惟有遺憾而已。</p>
<p>茲者此宜傳已久，舉世矚目之「中美積石山探測團」，幾經遲延，已令人不耐，而四月一日復因當諾之不遵守「約文」，片面撕毀探險計劃，我方幾經籌備之合作探險企圖，至是無疾而終，不僅耗費鉅款，更予我國團負以重大之精神打擊，宜激起國人之憤概。雷諾復藐視我國法令，破壞主權，及國際航空公法，私自駕機脫逃，種種不法行動，層出不窮，直如傳奇式之戲劇，幕幕演出，姑無論雷諾之不名譽行徑，騰笑中外，將受其本國之裁制，而此種騙局，實滑天下之大稽，探險其名，走私其實，對於吾國，尤其科學界，實爲一莫大之侮辱，同時對於美國科學界，亦係一重大之汚點，吾國科學界　宜有嚴正之表示，以免再有類似霍諾事件之出現。上海美國商會會長歇蓋氏本月五日所發表之公正談話，吾人殊有　　　社事發展至此，已非一純粹科學合作探險問題，關於破壞法令，侵犯主權，應循正當之外交途徑解決。至一於如何交涉？如何善後？當局想能善處，吾人「朱悉內容」，不容毓舌，否則徒增「不幸而言中」之感。</p>
<p>前事不忘，後事之師，吾人經此欺騙，啼笑皆非，以後再遇此類國際合作事件，允宜「愼重將事，母蹈覆轍」。復次，吾人更深感獨立自力之重要，合作有時不可恃。今偽貫澈積石山探測起見，吾人應再接再厲，擴大組織，重新部署，繼續進行，仍由中央研究院統籌領導，敎育·國防·農林·水利·經濟·資源各部會，協力贊助，更動員科學團體，如中國科學社，中華自然科學社，中央地質調查所，靜生生物調查所，以及中國地質·地理·氣象·物理·動物·植物·礦物·民族各學會，有關機關，一體參加，並商請國防部空軍總司令部借用探險專機，並駕駛人員，集中需用之科學儀器，如雷達之類，如此通力合作，舉行一大規模之西部山區探險，必可成功，且屬需要，而此時此地意義之重大，則逈異尋常，蓋一則所以表現中自科　之　立性　不必定須外力；一則可　此次之恥辱　　正國際之視聽；三則可作眞正之學術貢獻，確定積石山主峯之高度，永保原有之名稱。一舉數善，不容躊躇，蘭州十二個學術團體，亦有自力探測之建議，可知科學界有識人士，所見略同，甚盼科學當局，積極進行，及時舉辦，企予望之！</p>
<p>不寗唯是，科學探險所以增進人類之知識，開發天產之資源，舉凡天文氣象之觀測，山川地質之考察，海洋之航探，動植礦物之搜　，人種民俗之採訪，皆科學探險家所有事，故上極穹蒼，下臨無地，海角大涯，無遠弗屆，用能探奇尋勝，啓發秘奧，科學先進國家，多優爲之，而近三百年來，成績尤著，南北兩極，無不有探險家之足跡。吾國人素行穩重，少年老成，缺乏冒險精神，遠且弗論，即國境以內之名山大川，邊疆腹地，亦多未經探測，以致大好資源，委棄於地，民生匱乏，有由來矣。</p>
<p>吾國得天獨厚，處寒·溫·熱三帶，地大物博，由用縱橫，氣候攸殊，民族繁多，科學晚典，研究未備，爲今之計，首應組織各種勘測·考察·探險·採集·訪問·調查幽隊，分赴各地，尤其邊疆，作詳細之野外研究。至於高山探險，在吾國未之前聞，允宜提倡，獎勵靑年科學家，加以專門訓練，分向帕米爾，喜馬拉耶，阿爾泰，天山，興安諸高山，作各種有關科學之研究，固不僅區區之積石山而已。惟是統籌策劃，專賴有中心機構，總理其事，而中國探險協會之組織，亟有成立之必要，所以集中人力財力，謀衆擊之易舉。筆者有鑒於此，自愧棉薄，曾作「探險開發與科學研究」（載「科學」第二十九卷第八期三十六年八月中國科學社出版）一文，藉當呼籲。所望政府當局，社會賢達，科學專家，了然於探險開發對於建國大業之重要，共同發起，迅速促成，不僅科學之幸，亦國家之福，而此次雷諾之毀約失信，不但不足為吾人病，韓可促進吾國探險事業之發展，「塞翁失馬，安知非福」。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>代表喧囂·主席擊椎</p>
<p>〔本報日內瓦一日訊〕新聞自由會議進行在中途，像疲勞轟炸」的滋味一樣，許多國家的代表，開始感覺到壓倦，單調和索然寡味。對於那些缺乏新聞意義，而徧重於「兩條陣綫」的外交性質的辯論，程滄波先生第一個感覺壓煩，他每天開會，步行十分鐘回到旅館，一邊吃飯，一邊大叫「Nonsense。」。美國同業：威廉，亭斐琍，紐約前鋒論壇報歐洲版特派員，也口口聲聲講「無聊，無聊。」我看見他發回巴黎去的電報這樣說：「兩條陣綫分得太明顯，像其他千千萬萬次的國際會議一樣，對成就很少希望」</p>
<p>年經代表發牢騷</p>
<p>但是，儘管會塲的興趣並不緊張，辯論的舌劍唇槍，始終未見讓步，彼蘭的大砲放過以後，羅馬尼亞的年輕代表，也跟着在第一委員會大發牢騷，他大駡紐約前鋒論壇報的荒謬絕倫的記載，侵害羅馬尼亞的國家利益，他說：「英美記者一到羅馬尼亞，從來就不懷好意，」他說美國基督科學箴一位記者叫做馬根，他寫的通訊，盡是對羅馬尼亞的侮辱，不但反動，而且是資本家的走狗，是職爭販子。他說：英美報紙從來沒報導過東南歐的經濟復興與經濟建設，他們的記者在羅馬尼亞，享有充份的自由與保障，但他們從來就不揀好的方面寫，而專門我當地反對政府的人做朋友，由他們供給謠傳與謊言，作爲新聞題材。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的代表還說：由政府控制新聞事業，並不一定是壞事，主要的，還是要看那個政府是民主的？還是法西斯的？希臘代表認爲羅馬尼亞有意公然侮辱，他說：「希臘政府是經過人民投票合法產生的，它是民主的政府·」他籲請會塲注意誰是和平的愛好者？誰是侵略者？羅馬尼亞席上故意大笑，生席敲木錐，一片嘈雜，捷克代表大聲站起來叫：「希臘代表提出秩序問題，他本身就是一個妨礙秩序者！」南斯拉夫的代表說：「如果希臘代表認爲被侮辱，那麼，請主席注意第一天美國代表對捷克的侮辱！」另外有好幾個代表想參加「混戰」，聰明的小組委員會主席，就在那舉世滔滔中宣佈了「休會」。</p>
<p>誰絞殺新聞自由</p>
<p>第二天，英國的首席代表麥克男，作了一篇非常生動的演講，他把「斯拉夫集團的國家」，他們絞殺新聞自由，駡得體無完膚，另一方面，他講了許多英國爭取新聞的歷史，然後他說到英國人對於新聞自由的墾念，他說；英國社會把辦報作爲自由企業之一種，報館老闆，編輯，訪員，等於一個公司的老闆，店員，職工一樣，彼此都有公會的關後，他們講名譽，講信用，愛惜自己的聯業·報紙可以自由報導，自由表示意見，政府從不加以控制，從不加以指導，但因爲報紙不祗一家，彼此之間，有互相改正，互相辯駁的機會，他說：「譬如倫敦的保守黨的每日郵報，新聞報道錯誤了，或者言論誇張過份了，勞工黨的倫敦每日前鋒報，一定會指責它或辯駁它，相反的，如果每日前鋒報錯了，每日郵報也一定會指責它！」他按着滑稽地說；「縱然兩家報紙都沒有錯，共產黨的每日工人報，也一定會駁斥他們的！」全塲爲之捧腹。</p>
<p>基本概念與分野</p>
<p>「但是」，麥克男激昂慷慨地說：「假如莫斯科的眞理報記載錯誤了，有誰來糾正它？有誰來指責它？」他說：這就是新聞自由與不自由的基本分野，他要斯拉夫集團的代表，平心靜氣來檢討這一個基本觀念。</p>
<p>麥克男和美國代表團的意見一樣，主張大會把新聞自由的概念，簽訂一個世界共同信守的公約。</p>
<p>護照簽證的提案</p>
<p>美國代表團在第二委員會提出一個大提案，關於外國記者的護照簽證以及自由旅行，自由採訪的問題，引起非常激烈的辯論，南斯拉夫的代表戴迪傑，說美國代表在自己打自己耳光，「爲什麼美國政府一再拒絕共產黨報紙記者的簽證請求？」戴迪傑舉巴黎「人道報」（共產黨報紙）記者簽證被拒絕的故事爲證。跟着參加辯論的有波蘭·英國·印度。捷克。丹麥。法國的代表，第二委員會的中國代表鄧友德，贊成美國的提議，並且說明中國政府一向給予外國記者以最大方便出入國境。因爲他用中國話發言，在疲勞的辯論中，相當地引起了全塲的普遍興趣。（於斯屈拉斯堡飯店）</p>

<p>〔合眾家社羅馬十日電〕義大利政界對蘇聯否決該國加入聯合國之反響，旣迅速又悲憤，無疑義共在選舉前夕又遭嚴重之打擊。政府方面稱，「此事早在意料中，然吾人仍以爲蘇聯不致在大選前夕第三度拒絕義國，且由共黨自圖其說可也」。共黨早已表示將支持蘇聯之否決，除非蘇聯之衛星國亦同時蒙允參加。政治觀察家指出，因蘇聯之否決，各方面羣起譴責義共，愛國情緒已達戰後之高峯，人民均不願聽取爲蘇聯辯護之言論。</p>

<p>巴克蒂爾率衛隊拒捕已有一星期之久，卒於週四屈服。警察昨在德黑蘭近郊辛姆倫捕獲參加亞塞爾拜然自治政權事敗後逃入蘇聯之前陸軍上尉魯斯培。伊斯法漢省省長傳素與蘇聯有聯絡。據右翼報紙載稱，共黨有於五月初在伊舉事之計劃，參加者仍爲上次參加亞塞爾拜然自治運動之舊部及若干新人。若干親蘇人物於亞塞爾拜然運動失敗後即失蹤，其實均已逃入蘇聯，準備再起。據云，此番舉事地點爲馬森特倫省東沿裏海岸之高根平原，而馬森特倫，伊斯法漢，及伊朗南部中部之若干土著區，均爲共黨政變之戰略區。杜台黨人在伊斯法漢省殊爲活躍，已在積極從事煽動羣衆，蘇聯同時並利用寇時族之巴薩尼部落，已有不少此等部落自蘇潛入伊朗密謀舉事。該報總括共黨授意的「一三二七計劃」（本年爲伊朗曆一二二七年）謂其步驟在加緊宣轉輔以蘇聯之一再向伊朗提出抗議，以資脅迫，同時加派間課入伊，煽動土著反抗政府，然後在預定的日期同時在全國各地舉事。該報謂此等消息係接近政府之人士所透露。</p>

<p>（十六）保衛衡陽大挫日寇</p>
<p>在對日戰爭中，負責對華軍事供應的美國人，把大部份的供應品用於重行開放緬甸，而當一九四四年間中國局勢成爲危急之時，他們的帮助已經是太少和太晚了。</p>
<p>一九四四年日軍的一個目標，就是要從滿洲經中國到東南亞開闢一條內陸交通綫，這一點最後終吿實現。日方成功的記錄，也就是美方不聽警吿和不接受請求的記錄。　在五月裏，中國的局勢已經惡化到如此程度，假如不使用經駝峯運入以供成都附近基地方面日二九型機在未來作戰中應用的燃料——同時假如不使用超空堡壘以打擊日軍在揚子江南岸的攻勢根據地漢口的話——簡直沒有阻止日軍攻勢的機會。</p>
<p>遵照聯合參謀部的指令，戰區司令吏迪威握有宣佈緊急狀態以及對第二十轟炸大隊和戰區司令部的其他資源作緊急使用的權力。在五月中旬，我電吿史迪威說，緊急狀態已經迫在目前了。</p>
<p>我建議他規定一個宣佈緊急狀態的限度，藉使事前還有一些策劃的時間對於這一點，他用一種暗示來答覆，說這將使中國人完全俠賴我們。在危機成爲「的的確確」之前，他不預備宣佈緊急狀態。　這個電訊是於一九四四年五月二十五晶發出的，恰巧在日軍自揚子江南岸的湖南岸發動攻勢的前一天。攻勢的前一天。</p>
<p>我沒有其他辦法，祗能使第十四航空隊和中美混合空軍大隊傾其所能，實行攻擊，而同時重申災禍迫近的警吿和重提撥付更多供應品的要求，藉使這少數的飛機還能繼續作戰。我的警吿和請求並沒有產生具體的結果。直到六月中旬，戰區司令部也不得不承認災禍已迫在眉睫了。　四月下半月和五月上半月，揚子江北岸的河南省已爲日軍所攻破，作爲揚子江南岸湖南省攻勢的前奏。六月五日湖雨省省會長沙遭日軍攻擊，而於兩星期陷落。長沙是上一次日軍較弱的攻勢碰壁的地方。　要在河南阻止日軍是沒有辦法的，但在湖南則不然·在湖南，我們有堅强空軍部隊可以支持中國軍隊。祗要有少量的武器和供應，中國軍隊就可以有很好的表現的。此點對於自長沙南至衡陽駐守的薛岳都隊，尤爲準確。　我相信祗要在四月和五月中每月增加空軍的供應二千噸，就可挽回揚子江南岸的局勢。這個數量，祗比因發動怒江——緬甸作戰而使我們失却的空中供應，稍爲多一些。</p>
<p>日方在湖南方面使用的軍隊，大部份先調到揚子江方面，然後從漢口區向南發動攻勢。漢口是他們的主要根據地，揚子江是他們的供應綫，兩者都易於遭遇空中攻擊。四五兩月每月如能用去二千噸的燃料和軍火於空中攻擊方面，即可在攻勢開始之時，使敵人的力量削弱，使它步驟零亂，銳氣頓挫，對於武裝欠佳的中國軍隊是很有利益的。</p>
<p>薛岳部隊保衛衡陽四十七天的情形，支持這種信念。但是戰區司令部方面於日軍第一次發動攻擊的時候，就把衡陽當做已經失却的，而的確以隨便的失敗主義看待中國東部的戰事。</p>
<p>當日軍的砲隊於六月五日開始針對長沙的時候，史迪威離開緬甸，親自來注意一下中國方面的局勢，原來史迪威爲了打通緬甸公路之故，已經留在緬甸有幾個月了。他到昆明時，避不與我舉行會議，而即飛到重慶去和蔣委員長會商。</p>
<p>在重慶，史迪威最後同意增加第十四航空隊的供應到我所建議的程度。他在返歸緬甸途中在昆明逗留一刻，把這個決定吿訴我。他逗留的時間這樣短促，致使我們無法考慮和增加對華空運供應同樣重要的問題，那就是怎樣把供應品沿失修的交通綫向東運送到我們的空軍基地去。</p>

<p>「按非常時期人民團體組織法第十八條第一項規定，人民團體　反法令，妨害公益，怠忽任務時，主管官署得分別以左列處分：（一）警吿。（二）撤銷其登記。（三）整理。（四）解散。是本案所應審究者厥為訴願人有無違反法令，妨害公益或怠忽任務之情事。查本年一月廿四日，訴願人公會座談會議錄，載出席舞廳代表孫洪元等廿五人為職工舞女樂師代表卅四人，由孫洪元主席報告延長抽籤礙難照准。禁舞抽籤問題，已非常緊迫，請共同討論，當議決定一月卅一日上午九時假新仙林舞廳舉行第三次全體同人大會。又一月廿九日訴願人公會臨時座談會議錄，載出席舞廳代表孫洪元等廿一人及職工舞女從業員樂師代表廿五人，仍由孫洪元主席，討論事項第四案，卅一日大會之後，赴社會局請願案，議決全體前往，舞女備卡車送往。第七案卅一日大會及請願如有不到者，應否予以懲戒案，議決凡全體從業員如有不到者，一律處以停職，舞女不到者，處以二百萬元至三百萬元之罰款。又一月三十一日第三次同人臨時緊急大會第八案全體職工舞女等一致要求大會赴社會局請願案，決議全體一致通過。所有以上開會情形及議決案均有當時記錄存案可據，由上項記錄參互以觀，足證一月三十一日之集體請願純由訴願人策動，彰彰明甚。而備專車載舞女到社會局與如不到社會局便一律處以停職處分及二百萬至三百萬元等決議，其係蓄意强暴脅迫糾衆搗亂，無可諉卸，查上年五月十八日國民政府公佈維持社會秩序臨時辦法第二條載：凡人民團體或學校學生　　時，　派代　　　　　　　述意見，其代表人數以十人　限，不得聚衆脅迫，違者依　法一四九條之規定予以解散。此項法律應為訴願人所關知。乃　一再為前項決戰，於法已屬不合。況據調查訴願人策動請願到達原處分官署時，迄未遵照規定推派代表向原處分官署陳述意見，遽　實施暴動，搗毀公物，妨書公務，尤屬不法。縱令訴願人最初策動請願之目的或不在於實施暴動，然鼓動成千成萬之羣衆集體請願，即可能讓成任何不幸事件。訴願人職責所在，旣不能防範於前，當暴動發生之際，又不能及時為有效之勸阻，具見平時組織鬆懈，領導無方，怠忽任務之咎，無可解免。是本案訴願人旣違反法令策動集體請願於前，臨事復不能妥為領導？致引起暴行，影響社會治安，核其情節，顯非通常事件可比，從而由原處分官署予以解散，另行派員整理，綜上論結，本案訴願應認為無理由，爰依訴願法　　第八條第一項前段之規定，決定如主文」。</p>

<p>該訴狀所陳之事實與理由如次：緣本案被吿前於民國十九年六月間起，使用種種方法與手段，興原吿發生夫妻關係，翌年春間，由被吿租得本市受福里三十二號前樓一間，作為幽會同居之所。二十一年九月間受孕，當時原吿丈夫華顯平在金華任職，至廿二年廢曆五月十三日，即生一子，因被吿棄喜「覇王別姬」戲劇，逐為題名「霸信」嗣又遷住同里卅五號，情好日深，至廿五年九月間，又復受孕，是時原吿之夫在海門任職，廿六年廢曆六月十九日，復生一女，亦由被吿題名「小妹」。</p>
<p>迭向被告索夫</p>
<p>時因戰爭風雲日急，原吿丈夫自海門辭職返家，以上兩事，幸均巧言瞞過。被吿與原告之夫，原係友好，但常居家中，總多不便，該被吿力勸顯平前往汕頭代渠接盤鴻茂肥皂廠業務，原告及顯平均不知是計，毅然就道，被吿派有方姓等人跟隨，詎竟一去不歸，原吿乃起疑心，迭向索去，嗣聽被吿聲言「恐怕已死在香港」等語，含糊其詞。原吿身為弱女子，無計可施。洎自顯平離家之後，被吿公然往來原吿家中，且令覇信呼其為父，生活等費用，亦全由被告供給。</p>
<p>聲音形貌相同</p>
<p>是時被吿家中妻室已亡，要求原吿進宅，以正名分，原吿因此更起疑心，深疑顯平已為被告預謀加害，被吿見原吿追問日急，至民國三十年乃竟因情虛不來，對於子女亦竟棄而不顧。後幷串通舊捕房包打聽，假造恐嚇信，企岡陷害原告以滅口，訟爭迄茲已六年之久，尙無結果，原吿丈夫至今亦幷未歸家，前曾訴請確認，以「當事人不適格」駁回。按本案利害關係人，明明為被吿與原吿所親生，聲音形貌，一模一樣，安容被吿昩心遺棄，關於原吿丈夫生死不明部份除另案訴究外，為特陳明上述眞情，請求依法判決。</p>
<p>開庭審間否認</p>
<p>惟該案前經法醫研究所鑑定血型所得結論：奚潤耕，華王氏均為〇形血簇，而霸信及小妹則均為A形血簇，根據血簇遺傳之統計公式，是霸信及小妹之A形血簇，應非由兩個〇型血簇配合所產生，</p>
<p>地院日前曾開庭審訊一次，原吿華王氏供稱奚昩良遺棄，並有害死伊丈夫陰謀，奚則供稱誣吿，堅不承認　華王氏有發　　　係</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「瘋人之謎」案主角嚴培與，昨日下午四時在無錫同鄉會再度招待記者。嚴精神較上次招待會為佳，起立報吿時口齒清哳，頭頭是道。他首先將以往與他妻子糾葛及被押送瘋人院經過重述一邊。他的報告中又提出兩點新材料，一為去醫院時共乘汽車兩輛，一輛為祥生公司出差汽車，一輛為私人出差汽車，號嗎最後三字為「六一六」。二為普慈醫院中會有人顯明對他說：他所以被送進醫院來是某某人起意。　關於出院後的進行控訴情形，他說巳向警察局請求澈查。警察局已傳他訊問七次，刑事處孫處長曾勸他和解，但他鑒於妻子手段毒辣，即最近在警察局對質時還是說他有神經病，說他不能處理廠務，並說本來廠中請侯寄遠來做經理很好。他覺得妻子眞是毫無良心，所以不願意隨便和解。如果要和解第一先要收回失物，但前日雙方會同律師及警察局人員至各廠接收時，檢點貨物短少五金零件三四十箱，後來嚴將廠門下鎖後，他妻子又派人將鎖鍊銼斷，嚴所派看守的工人被驅逐，又將他張貼的佈吿撕去。大西路分廠昨天並有侯寄遠派人一姓宋一名趙金偉的去探視，所以民事部份仍未解決，刑事部份決請警察局加緊偵查。最後嚴又說：「請各位看看，我的確並無神經病！」</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕勝利後有幾家影片公司，曾經舉辦過好多次臨時演員的考試，在擁擠得發在的許多應微者，異口同聲的說是對電影藝術有特殊愛好，後來經各公司他細研究，發覺所謂「愛好電影藝術」云云，完全是一種飾詞，實在他們不過想做一做「明星」，享受一下萬千觀衆對他的那種無聲的艷羡而已。　但是，這些胸懷大志的人不幸都失望了，兩三年來，我們很難得在銀幕上看到幾個陌生的面貌。縱有少數「客串明星」出現，像謝家驊，袁雪芬，衣雪艷，華香琳等等，那是因為她們備有「小姐」，「皇后」之類的頭銜，或竟是拍片由於「自費」的緣故。現在影片公司的發行收入大部份依賴南洋，南洋的僑胞到目前止，　熱烈地迷　着幾個老脾明星的聲容笑貌，同時也憧憬着國內素負時譽的「名媛」們的舉止動態，她們的躍登銀幕當然正是際會風雲。一個新人倘使單憑一點演技，要想在銀幕上去向南洋觀衆大獻殷勤。其結果是一定不會太理想的；現在一部影片成本，至少在百億以上，影片公司不能為着幾個新人的登庸，去做這種冒險的投資。</p>
<p>明星生活未必舒適</p>
<p>其實即使眞正做到了「明星」，生活方面也未必像一般人想像中的那樣富麗舒適。影片事業目前尙無人供給貸款，上海各外商影院又不肯經常上映國片，雖然上海以外的許多小都市中，國產影片賣座很好，便票價極但，在高物價下生產的影片向低物價的農村都市傾銷，總收入當然有限，現在除了幾個有數的熠熠紅星以外，整個電影從來員的生活都很淸苦，底薪仍滯留在六十五元以下，時代的苦難所加諸於影片業肩上的，和我們身受的並無二致；從業員無法進修、電影藝術要達到國際水準，自然更屬渺茫了還有近</p>
<p>影響到心理上拘束</p>
<p>年來國產影片在社會上引起的風波，也使製片業受了不少打擊，「甦鳳記」中的空軍「一江春水向東流」中的醫生，「假鳳虛凰」中的理髮師，「玉人何處」中的司機，都曾在這幾個職業階層中惹下莫大的反感。這種反感的釀成，一方面固然影響到編劇者心理上的拘束，他方面更使管理影片檢查的人，對任何一部影片都不肯輕易放過；譬如說他們要求國產影片製作因果意識，壞人一定立刻到法庭前受裁判，到監獄裏去渡歲月，不能像美國影片那樣；一個兇手犯罪後鴻飛冥冥，結果在數年後被情婦謀害，或是在酗酒和格鬥中被手刃了。壞人旣然作惡，就不應再有財富或艷遇，連打架也祗應吃拳頭，立下風的。他們又要求國產影片對一切職業和宗敎不能侮　，像美國影片「神鎗手」「翡翠谷」中那樣開始背叛宗敎而終又皈依宗敎的人，或是寄身在宗敎的掩護下為非作歹的人，都不可能出現。</p>
<p>設備簡陋改善困難</p>
<p>繼劇者把一切的人都寫成　調，善良，把所有的事都寫為圓滿，這還是可以辦到的，但攝影器材的低劣却實在無法改進，補充要錢，從國外購進要外匯；現在各公司的燈光設備簡陋，影片感光過慢，派員面部的化裝常常縱微畢露，使觀衆看來與平劇無異。好萊塢老明星克勞黛考爾白，安秀麗丹等人，在鏡頭中猶是荳蔻年華，欺騙觀衆，風靡觀衆，數十年如一日，這在國產影片是絕對不敢企想的。據影片業中人說，即使黃宗霑回到上海，有意在祖國一顯身手，但在這積「開麥拉」前，保護他也定有用武無地之感。</p>
<p>這些，足够說明縱是一部最低級最無聊的西片，也能在國內暢銷不表的原因。</p>

<h3 id="c88">一般物價　銀根轉進鬆弛時期　物價漲風又被掀起 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>本刋上期已經指出按照通貨膨脹後期物價升降互現銀根鬆緊交替的必然法則來觀察，上週銀根又到一個鬆弛的時期。事實的表現與理論的推測並無多大距離，上週銀根的鬆弛實爲一月來未有的現象。過一起，承前週末的鬆勢，依舊鬆濫異常。暗息比前週末再降一分，計爲二角六分，行莊普遍多單，甚至有拆不出之苦。這種鬆弛的銀根對物價有何影響當然不言可喻。但上週物價漲風之再起尙有比較特殊的三項因素，爲以前幾週所無。這些因素的影響並不限於上週爲止，對今後一週仍將發生深刻的影響，這是値得注意的一點。甚至市塲人很多商人心理認爲本年度第二次物價大波動將從上週起開始，雖然這是商人的看法，並無學理上的根據，但市塲上商人若多數對物價看漲，其對物價的影響是不難想像得到的。上週物價之重起漲風除了銀根鬆濫的原因之外其他三種特殊因素是：</p>
<p>第一，停止證券遞延交割交易之命令於前週六由行政院指令財經二部，前週日財經二部駐證交監理負辦公處接奉部令後立即轉知證交當局，證交當局即遵照辦理。此舉在政府當局固爲取締投機性交易，不無理由，但從其有關物價的方面看，對物價自有很大影響。一方面，每期遞交中套利炎金現巳達一萬餘億，遞交停止活動後，此項資金豈不又將成爲社會上的游資。另一方面，存入國行的遞交證金及追加證金，爲數亦甚巨。遞交取消後這一筆證金將從國行流出，社會游資豈不又將多一來源。道些游資至少有一部份將走入吸收物資之途。　第二，上週二外匯平衡基金委員會又將各種外匯提高約百分之二十五左右。美匯基準價升爲三十二萬四千元，計漲六萬九千元；英匯九十七萬二千元，計漲二十萬七千元；港匯印匯無不提升。其影響當然顯而易見。當日華股市塲即起漲風，現貨竟有十三種漲停，外股亦同樣趨堅，會德豐竄出五百萬大關·紗布市塲亦授其影響，市氣重振。週三華股現貨再現滿堂紅，外股高升二成。紗布市塲漲勢轉烈。這些都是外匯提升後立刻表現的影響，但其影響並不以上週爲限。此外對金鈔黑市的影響更不言可喻，港申電匯上週四竟縮爲八角五分合法幣十萬元，這是破紀錄的新價，當然這也免不了受外匯基準價提升的影響。</p>
<p>第三，上週五本市四項公用事業電話電燈自來水等一致漲價，均漲百分之六十至七十不等，這次漲價百分率之高爲歷次所僅見。其影響之甚當詭亦非以上週爲限。</p>
<p>上週物價以上數項因素影響之下頗多上升，尤以後半週爲甚（但請注意本會所編各項物價指數僅以週一至週四之材料爲限，此歟完全係因出版時間限制使然）。尤以建築材料，棉紡織品及食糧上升較甚。上週四紗布市塲都現新高價。四十二支藍鳳每件高達二億四千萬，二十一支雙馬高達一億六千萬，十二磅龍頭細布高出五百萬大關。這都是以往未見的新紀錄。週末雖略見回落，但各項棉紡織品比前過末仍高出一成以上。絲織品上漲較少。食糧市塲因市府配糧價格提高，且因上週初謠傅民食調配委員會因糧市不振，有收購食米之說，後雖經該會否　但市塲已受其影響。上白粳每石上週五再見四百萬高價，特高粳最高曾達四百十五萬。兵船麥粉每袋亦再接近百五十萬之高峯，其他食油雜糧亦均同時跟升。建築材料中之木料磚瓦上升更速。化學品，金屬等較平穩，如六九三硫化元每桶由前週末之五千萬元到上週末不過升二百萬。但可慮者是外匯調整及公用事業漲價之影響將在今後數週絡續顯現，而遞交停止後如政府無新出路以疏導此項遞交吸收之資金，市上游資又將多一來源，此歟或許金融常局已有成竹在胸。</p>
<p>此外市塲上各項謠傳尤不一而足，如外匯市塲將重行開放，進出口貿易將准予實施部份聯鎖制，外匯基準價將再度調整等無不刺激物價上升。這些謠言之如何平息自然也是平抑物價的一項主要標的。</p>

<p>上週本市銀根，全面鬆弛至濫。自前週週末以後，國行爲應付短期庫券的兌換及其他支付，曾　續發行大批新鈔，於是市塲籌碼爲之充塞。上週週一部令停止華股遞交交易並限定七日爲最後了結期，雖說行莊嗣後得舉辦利息與國行同業存款相等的星期儲蓄信託存款，以吸</p>
<p>收因遞交停止而自套利市塲撤離的資金，但由於此種信託存款之利息不若套利息之高昂，仍可能有一部份爲數頗巨的資金變成游資，上週後半週以後本市銀根的益見鬆濫或與此有關。除此而外，一週來國家行局的連續差出及外埠游資的紛紛擁至亦爲決定上週銀根全面鬆濫的主因。</p>
<p>自上週週一至週五五天以內，國家行局的交換差額除週四有三百四十九億的眞實差進外，其他幾天，一致實出，在扣除國行的同業定存以後，四天內國家行局的實際差出高達六千七百餘億。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，一週來普遍多單，頭寸壅積異常，同業拆放幾瀕於停頓。自週一至週五，，六十號以後行莊交換結果共差出七千三百卅三億。其間週三一天，竟差進三百七十二億，亦可測行莊存底之豐厚。</p>
<p>上週洋商銀行交換結果，自週一至週五共差進五千九百八十二億，其間包括週三一百九十一億之差出，按洋商銀行之差出，並不多見，聞與北資南來有關。</p>
<p>銀根鬆濫的另一現象爲暗息繼續跌落，上週前半週的暗息大致在二角七分與四分之間，後半週有低做二角二分半及二角一分落入銀行業欠息脾價以內者。至於證券帮白紗對敲貼息，週三以前，大致故二角四五分，週四則昂至四角左右，當係受股市煥發人心樂觀的影響。</p>
<p>內外匯率</p>
<p>上週本市商業銀行內匯率行市，一般說來，均見提高。津匯貼水週初爲五十元，週三至週五巳升至三十元。漢口匯水亦自週一之三十元續升至週五之一百元，重慶匯水至週四五亦已自二十元增爲三十元，厦門匯水週初爲一百卅元，週五巳提高至二百元，穗匯匯水一週來大抵在一百七八十元左右盤旋，各地匯率之提高，顯示本市資金外流之加劇，穗匯之所以獨見平疲，可能係受本市短期庫券代替匯資南流的影響。</p>
<p>上週外匯行市基準率美匯於週二又見掛高爲一美元合國幣三十二萬四千元，計上升百分之二十七，英美套匯率未變，折合爲每英鎊合法幣儿十七萬二千元。香港申匯行情續見緊縮，至週三已走進一元大關。週四再縮，法幣十萬僅値港幣八角五分，與基準率掛高不無關係，香港美鈔市價在港幣五元七角二三分左右，港匯不斷報縮，可見資金外逃俠舊劇烈。</p>

<p>上週華股，猛升疾退，波動堪稱劇烈。週一部令停止華股遞交交易，規定四月五日前市起停止一切新遞交交易，如有了結交易，亦只能做到七日止。這不啻在股海中吹起了一陣驚濤駭浪，致現遞十八種股票均吿跌停。永紗現期跌入一千四百關。但週二忽受外匯掛高利買之刺激，大戶逢低猛吸，現期十四種復紛達漲限，一出一進，起伏幾達三成。週三港匯縮進一元大關，銀根鬆馳，華股現期廿一種均達漲限，週四前市永紗更高叩二千元大關，但以大戶穫利吐售，收盤稍見回挫。週五銀根鬆濫依舊，再加上公用事業突提價七成左右，股市受此刺傲，亦隨而普升一成。永紗臨收竟再叩二千元關。如以上週週五華股收價與週一牧價比，永紗計軋漲四成，景綸軋漲百分之三十三，中絲漲率竟在五成以上。此次漲風之劇烈，頗屬罕見，本市游資實力之强亦可見一般。</p>
<p>外股一週來起伏波動較微，外匯掛高，銀根搬濫，港匯報縮，公用事業擬價，均足予以利買之刺澈，故行情除週一週四稍挫外，餘一致軋漲，如以週五午後買價與週一相比，其間怡紗軋漲百分之三十七，怡　約漲三成，英聯漲百分之二十六，會德豐漲二成半，一般說來，波動不若華股之烈。</p>

<p>凍結生活指數問題</p>
<p>一週來爲了生活指數逐月上升的爭執，勞資雙方的對立關係，好像益見其表面化了。但是廠商方面的內心非常明白：第一，工人階級有組織的力量，碍難與之作正面衝突。第二，就貨幣的購買力說，生活指數不過一般物價指數的半數，在物價不停上漲，貨幣購買力不斷跌落的渦程中，欲明目張胆底凍結生活指數，不但工人階級本身無法忍受，以至會激起怠工罷工一迎串的反抗，即在一般的道義上言，凍結生活指數，亦屬不義且非社會與論所讚許，於是廠商的矛頭就不得不轉向當今的政府當局，要求政府增加工人的實物配給來變相的凍結生活指數。</p>
<p>但是政病爲了負担沉重的戰費，已將公敎人員的生活，降至最低的水準以下，但在今日公敎人員的生活指數已非加以解凍不可的局面之下，還要附加一筆數目不太小的工人實物配給，的確是一個非常不易處理的難題。雖說問題意外困難，但政府當局究非採取應付這一問題的步驟不可，因此社會局方面即表示今後工廠所有一切配給物資均須通過合作社辦理，並表示一俊全市各重要工廠合作社普遍成立後即將擴大工人配給，而届時編製生活指數，即可以配給品價計算，這正如該局合作科長所說明者，全市合作工作之積極推行，在减免中間人之盤剝漁利，籍收穩定物價之實效，以達變象凍結生活指數之目的云。</p>
<p>另據報載社會局爲普　　理工人配給而擬具之計劃，　致寫：（一）原料工廠應以成本價供給成品工廠參加配給，（二）直接製造成品工廠，政府應以一部份物資配給藉以减輕製造成本，（三）國家銀行對成品工廠，應給予貸款，　各工廠從事大規模生產，（四）配　辦法，將來仍以合作方式辦理。</p>
<p>上列擬具中計劃之第一項顯然對原料工廠不利，故如，其他補救，此類工廠之處境將益感困難。二三兩項乃變相的恢復工貸，工貸恢復後，假定其他情况不變，能否使生產如期增加而達到穩定物價的目的，尙待事實證明。</p>
<p>假如生產量未因各項有利條件之供給而如期增加，又如生產量增加後因其他因素之繼續惡代（如通貨仍膨脹等）而物價未能穩定，則所謂以合作方式辦理配合云云，無非是變相的一種事先囤積而已，這樣，對於一般物價的剌激可能更爲劇烈，一切惡劣的影響也未始不能加深與普遍呢！</p>
<p>「穀賤傷農」「榖貴傷民」歟？</p>
<p>正當大多數的市民額手相慶食米價格日見下跌的時候，米舖的標價却又逐日掛高了。上週之初，本市雜糧界人士表示極盼配米當局注意兩件事：（一）爲食米之儲藏問題，據說米倉中已有部份食米霉爛，霍節將届，特堪注意。（二）產米區米價反較本市爲高，可能造成本市存米倒流現象。至於政府當局，從不同之觀點，亦表示爲米價日跌，銷路呆滯作無限的憂慮！同時爲預防起見，民調會將計劃收購到埠食米辦法（見社會局糧食科長談話）。計劃冲的辦法爲各米商如有存貨不能脫手者，由民調會照市塲成交價收購，先付百分之八十價款，其餘百分之二十交貨後再付。同時，據說爲穩定本市糧價，民調會特將自蕪湖漢口等處採購之食米轉讓九萬担與南京市府。社局糧食科長認爲民調會收購到埠食米措施，不可能刺激米價上升，因爲據說民調會除每月計口授糧外，並可隨時準備應付市塲需要，一旦米價上漲，民調會即可將收購之食米無限制拋售，以調節供求。但事實恰恰與某科長所理解的完全相反，八日報載『食米漲風擴大，因民食調配會欲定市塲收米，致使甫吿穩定之米市，重起波瀾，死灰復燃」，民調會對『擴大食米漲風』的資任，當然負担不起，因此否認收購食米之詞復見於九日之報端，同時以三日來米價上漲一成半的原委，歸諸運價高漲及外匯牌價提升之刺激上。但是，平心而論，所謂無風不起浪，三日來米價上漲一成半，果然與外匯掛高等不無關係，但與有關當局對米價日跌表示憂慮並披露民調會收購計劃以及九萬担食米轉讓京市等事實亦「不謀而合」，其中微妙關係，明眼人自不消細說。「收購到埠食米旣不可能刺激米價上升」，於是在「甫吿穩定之米市」上相機收購之，如果因此而米市「重起波瀾，死灰復燃」，則「一旦米價上漲，民調會即可將收購之食米無限制拋售，以調節供求」，低價收進，高價拋售，一進一出之問自有盈利，且均有理論以爲根據，收購時之理論爲「穀賤傷農」，拋售時之理論爲「穀貴傷民」，但究竟此項理論根據能否成立，政府當局似還値得老慮。</p>

<p>以上所有易貨交易，槪由中央信託局易貨處統籌辦理。今年對日易貨物資，仍將以食鹽爲主，尤以畏蘆鹽爲大宗，現已決定輸日六士萬担。台灣方面亦有餘鹽二萬餘噸候船裝運。上週又有東北大豆一萬八千噸，由天津運去。漢口方面則運出豆餅，落花生等雜糧一萬四千噸。前日首批台糖七萬一千包，計重七千噸，亦已運抵日本，是爲根據合同運日之第一批台糖。其他尙有海南島之二十萬噸鑛砂輸日，曾使日人欣喜若在。最近更有日本三位工程師抵達海南島勘測。所有貨物，除交換人造絲等物外，更擬換取紡錘十二萬錠，蓋日本棉織工業極具有潛在力量，日本目前每月能製造紡錘三萬至四萬錠，而我國一年中始能製造此同等數目，且我國迄今猶缺乏一個大規模之製造紡錘工廠。日本本年度棉織工業之生產目標，爲棉布九億五千五百十萬七千碼，將大量傾銷遠東各地，其對象不但包括南洋朝鮮等處，以與我國紡建公司競爭，即我國本土亦列在其中。綜觀年來中日間易貨情况，仍不脫「工業日本，農業中國」之範疇，展望未來，實足令人警惕萬分！</p>

<p>科學高空探險  劉達德　　平流層探險家，健皮卡特（Jeanpiccard），現任美國明尼蘇達大學航空學敎授，目前正計劃着一次十九英里的高空旅行。他曾遭遇過無數次的困難和打擊，諸如有關空氣的，新聞界的，大學管理人的或是純粹科學方面的，但皆能一一克服。這位贏弱的化學工程師努力昇高他的氣球，只是為了欲對宇宙綫（Cosmic　rays）作更進一步的探討。他現在有一個最大的願望，想使一組七十五個範塑物（Plaslics）製成的氣球，昇到眞正可以研究宇宙綫的高度。　　第一次的昇空——笑談的資料　　皮卡特原定去年夏天再作一次平流層的旅行，計劃着乘一組不下於七十五個範塑物製成的氣球昇上高空，每個氣球的直徑為六十五呎，這個計劃却因故延遲到今年才會舉行。　　過去許多人都把他看作一個奇怪的人，報紙上也常常把他和他的氣球當作笑料，以為境在還乘着氣球去作高空飛行的冒險，簡直是一件愚笨可笑的舉動。可是皮卡特不管這些，雖然可能他是最後一個還在幹這種「可笑工作」的人，却仍是堅持的繼續下去。　　他的第一次昇空曾於一九三四年十月在第爾波能（Dearborn，Michigan）舉行，氣球和艀艇（Gondola）全由他和他的雙生兄弟奧格斯特（Auguste）親自設計，製造的費用—五千美金，由朋友和商人們零星凑集的，製成後到從芝加哥百年進步博覽會中得到了一筆獎金。這次航行的同伴就是他的太太——珍納莉偷（Jeannette　Ridlon）。早晨六點五十八分鐘，五千人在鵠候着他們初次的昇上天空，熱心的汽車大王亨利福時（Hrnry　Ford）就是內中的一個，為了守候他竟一個晚上沒有睡覺。　　這次航行昇高達57，579呎(約合十一英里），橫過了愛里湖（Lake　Erie），八個鐘點以後，他們在加的斯城（Codiz，Ohio）附近一座樹木茂盛的山腹上降落，在着陸的前一剎那，他們還很沉着的將足球帽好好的帶上。過了不久有一個胆大的人跑進樹林，在那消了氣的氣球中間，發現他們躺在那裏，皮卡特的踝骨也跌壞了。可是他們毫不以為意，却為一些事情慶幸着：（一）那隻吉祥的烏龜，名叫Fieurde－lis的，仍然好好的活着。（二）所有的儀器都未損壞。（三）一袋為集郵家所保留的信依然無恙。　　第二次的昇空——科學的研究　　一九三七年七月，為了試驗一束氣球較一個單獨的大氣球更適合於平流層飛行的理論，皮卡特坐在一個浴盆式的艀艇之中，上面有八十個白橡皮的氣球繫住它，在羅徹斯特（Rochester　Minnseota）昇上高空。這次他的太太雖未同行，她却隨時用短波無綫電和她的丈夫通話，而這些話的內容差不多全是勸吿他不要飛得太高。六小時後，離出發地已有一百一十英里，皮卡特為了避免掉在密西西比河內，在一萬一千呎的高空，他設法放掉了許多的氣球始得下降，最後掉在一棵樹上，他從樹上爬了下來，目睹他的浮艇慢慢燒完，他趕快跑到附近一個可以拍發電報的地方，拍一電給他的太太：「安全着陸，氣球控制極佳，設備全毀。　　不過無論如何，經過了這次飛行之後，人們對他的精神，漸漸有了認識，皮卡特下次的昇空，再不會給人們當作笑料，而會被當作一種科學研究看待了。這正是很久以來他和許多人所熟切盼望的。　　工作的重心—宇宙綫　　皮卡特希望能够打破現在已有的昇空紀錄（72，394呎），而達到十萬呎（約合十九英里）的高度。美國海軍當局對這樣一個重要航行的費用，已表示願意資助。皮卡特計劃停在高空八小時，以備有充分的時間來作許多有關科學的測量。這決非火箭或是無人駕駛的氣球所能作到的。　　最重要的，他希望能藉此對有關宇宙綫的問題得到更多的了解，譬如宇宙綫到底是什麼？為什麼它們能重疊（Duplicaed）？它們能够增加些什麼到我們現在所有的原子能知識中來？事實上，我們可以說皮氏是首先利氣用球來研究宇宙綫的人。同時，像他這樣一個具有如此廣泛興趣和天才的人，若是問什麼是他最專心研究的呢？那我們立刻可以說宇宙綫的研究，是他最主要的工作。　　家庭的興趣—輕氣球　　每個星期日的晚間，他們夫婦便請了許多客人來歡聚，待客人去後，皮卡特親自來做淸潔的工作，他用科學的方法洗凈碟子—用他的化學知識，決定什麼食物最好用肥皂水洗而什麼要用淸水來洗。　　他的全家對氣球部熱心異常，一九三四年，皮夫人成為第一個駕着氣球到單流層的女子。在下一次的航行中，雖然海軍部不准她隨丈夫同往，她還是熱心的飲一個助手的工作。他們最小的兒子—唐（Don），前年二月獨目駕着氣球上昇，在年靑人來說他也是第一個如此做的人。皮卡特的雙生兄弟，我們知道也是一個有名的氣球家，他較皮氏更早開始平流層的探險；一九三一年他昇高至51，793呎，一九三二年至54，120呎，可是現在，他却計劃着從相反的方向發展—海底裏去。他將乘一個球形的自由浮動的潛水艇，在大西洋由靠近赤道的地方深入海底，來研究他所看見的一切。若是計劃成功，他可以沉下潤一萬三千呎，　乎是五倍於他人所會下去過的深度。　　至於健。皮卡爾特呢，他的眼睛仍然凝視着天空，想着上昇到任何人所不曾去過的高空。他嘲笑一些人的說法，說是氣球的航行為危險或太緊張，因為他自己毫無這種感覺。　　他說：「有人告訴我說老年人不適宜於這樣的航行，那完全是胡說。旣然替我準備了這樣的工作，我就應該好好的幹去　。」　　從他身上，我們可以看出真正科學家的精神了。秘密墨水  劉遂生　　軍事情報，男女戀書，每利用秘密墨水通訊，以防洩漏。予於研究化學之餘，收集多種，以供參考：　　（一）糊或米湯—用筆沾稀漿糊或米湯，寫字於紙上，乾後不見痕跡。酒以碘酒，即顯藍色字跡，非常淸楚。再浸於大蘇打中，字即消失。　　（二）三氯化鐵—用三氯化鐵稀液，寫字於紙上，待乾不見字跡。噴以硫　酸鉀液，則字顯血色。若噴以黃血鹽液，則字呈藍色。　　（三）苯酚——苯酚譯名非諾爾夫他林（Phenolphthalein），溶於酒精中，沾此液寫信，不見顏色。塗以石鹼水，即現紅色；若塗以橘汁，紅色隱去，或洒以氨水，字顯紅色；置火上微烘，字又隱去。　　（四）膽礬—膽礬學名硫酸銅，溶於水中。沾此液寫字，不露痕跡。噴以氨水，即現淺藍色；若洒以黃血鹽液，即顯褐色。　　（五）硝酸鈷或氯化鈷—上用液寫信於粉紅紙上，不顯字跡。噴以黃血鹽液，則現紅棕色。或置火上烘之，即顯藍字；呵氣或濕以水，字又隱去，故又名隱顯墨。　　（六）昇汞—昇汞又名猛汞，學名氯化汞，有大毒。沾此液寫信，不顯字跡。噴以稀鹼液，即呈明亮的黃色。或洒以碘化鉀液，顯深紅色；若多噴洒，紅色盡褪。　　（七）綠礬—綠礬學名硫酸亞鐵，能溶於水，用以寫字，不露字跡。浸於赤血鹽液中，即現籃字。　　（八）溴化鉀與硫酸　—　　種藥品網溶於水中，寫字於紙上，不見字踐。用火燒之，顯金黃色。　　（九）石炭酸—用上液寫信，不見字跡，噴射三氯化鐵，則字呈萬色。　　（十）硫酸鐵—用上液寫字，不顯字跡。若用　酸俗名單寗酸液噴射，字現黑色。安濃茶亦可有效。　　（十一）硝酸銀—用上液寫字於藍紙或黑紙上，乾後不見字跡，浸紙於食鹽水中，則字呈白色。噴以氰化鉀液，亦顯白字；但噴射過量，字又不見。　　（十二）鉛粉或鉛糖—用鉛粉液寫字後，吹以硫化氫（硫化鐵加鹽酸）氣，則字現黑色。用鉛糖（學名醋酸鉛有大毒）液寫字，嗜射鉻酸鉀液，則字呈明黃色。　　（十三）氯化鋇或硝酸鋇—沾上液寫字於黑紙上，不見字痕。噴以稀硫酸或芒硝又或瀉鹽液，則呈白色　　（十四）雜例—任取明礬水，汽水，水菜汁，稀鹽酸等寫字，均不見字跡。置火上烘之，黑色之字立現　　秘密墨水種類頗多，不克盡述；無非依據化學原理而發生。至若秘密傳遞照片，亦有妙法：法將欲寄往對方的照片，浸於赤血鹽和溴化銨的混合液中，則黑色盡褪，即以此白色紙片寄去。對方得之，投於硫化鈉液中，則像復現，色呈黃褐。　　參考書：劉遂生：化學幻術（中華）。科學娛樂與實驗（商務）。皮卡特  漪（Jean　Piccard）道六十四歲的高空探險家，眼睛仍然凝視着天雲在人計劃如何能使他的氣球上昇的高度，打破記　無聲勝有聲  葦妮　　那人走過草地，跑來跑去，推着一個小小像箱子的物件在他前面。他也許是用着一個探礦器吧！但無論他走到那裏，靑草全都被割短了。　　隣人們都跑過來看——他是否在割草？他們互相疑問，但為什麼他的割草器沒有吵聲？但在牠前面二三吋位置的草總是倒下來，像被人觸倒一般。　　那主婦把她的衣服放在洗衣機裏，一按電紐。水並沒有移動，但馬上變得汚穢和起泡沫像已完成一次洗滌一般。事實上，一剎那間，衣服變成雪白。　　目　的人都說工作是在完全靜默中進行。這點他們弄錯了，這也許是世界最吵鬧的機器，不過吵聲都是高音人類聽不到吧！　　這是人類最新的科略在工作，這科學是超聲波，是關於超過我們耳朶範圍的聲音，頻率甚高。最好的例證是狗的火哨，狗主發出無聲的哨音，但狗能在幾條街遠聽到。　　今日，在戰爭和平時，超聲波有顯明的實際利用。華盛頓國家標準局裏的科學家己利用超聲波來割草，英國很多的洗衣店也用超聲波來洗衣。　　那些一「高調」的聲音猛烈地激動草莖，使牠們折斷了。在洗衣店或乾洗作裏，聲昔把汚穢震齜衣服。‘　　超聲波在一盆水裏有用，有利用在海洋裏工作，效果更是偉大——拯救海中失事的生命。加利福尼亞大學一位科學家已發展這方法。　　超聲波，常在水中進行時，受溫度及密度的影響，由水面向下屈折，又由水底向上曲。因此在某一滴中的深度，牠可沿直綫進行。這平面大約在水面下三千呎。這一點知識便被用來做成求救彈。一艘蔣沉的船把彈投在水裏，牠會在三千呎的深度爆炸。收訊站都設在海島和沿岸上，不斷地接收求救彈發出的訊號。這些收訊站同時收到聲波，在數秒鐘之內便可決定失事的情况。　　這並不是初次把超聲波利用在海裏，在戰時，海軍的「桑納」把潛艇獵獲，就是了。「桑納」的作用是：在船底裝置一個超聲發生器，不斷的向各方面旋轉。每發出二度「脈搏」後，發生器同時用作接收器，在水中任何阻礙把聲反射回來，潛艇便是。回聲到達的時間，計算出潛艇距離多遠。發生器的方向指示位置。　　今日，超聲波更可用以測出冰山的位置，鐵達尼號　悲劇不能再重演了。牠是在一九一二年與冰山相碰於北大西洋。　　把超聲波發生器指向水底，可以量度水的深度，很是準確。將「脈動」波埀直地送下去，因回聲到達的時間，自動計便可正確地指出水的深度。　　此外，超聲波可指出合金中不均勻之點，這對於做火箭投射器有很大的帮助，新的合金也可究成。　　最後，超聲波能把重油變成汽油，將來這也許會成為最新最便宜煉油的方法。　　對於人體方面，牠能帮助抵抗細菌，牠能致若干種細菌於死命，因此能用以消毒或潔凈食水。在醫學上，超聲波極有希望，德國科學家指出超聲波能溫暖骨骼而不使牠受傷　　但如超聲波可以救人，說不定也可用以殺人，像喬治依金尼將軍提出的死聲問題。楊白，一位灰髮瘦削的發明家，他底奇異的經驗對這問題有極大的重要性，他製造了一個「高調」的汽笛。雖然這笛沒有鬧鐘大，但可以發出二萬五千瓦特的聲波（普通無綫電收音機只有一至十瓦特。）有一次，在他未懂得牠的功效時，他把汽笛的調提至高於聽覺範圍內，又把音量增大。他並沒有聽見什麼，只覺得臉部肌肉很是軟弱鬆弛。他再把這「默」緊加大，他的乎指疆硬了，他忘記自己在做什麼，呆坐着，感覺麻痺，達五分鐘之久。室中的助手也有同樣情形。後來一位來客走進房裏，把汽笛關上。楊白們在好幾分鐘後才恢復過來。　　一位加利福尼亞的科學家那達博士把一個年靑的女數學家曝露在超聲波發生器之前。雖然她並不知道聲波對她有什麼影響，她只覺腦力陣陣消失。這婦人，正常時能做最複雜的數題，現在迎簡單的加法也不會，二加二是多少也不曉得。但在幾分鐘後她算是恢復過來了。　　一個化學家，天天對着超聲波發生器工作。他底平衡力竟喪失到連坐脚踏車也不能，直至他的研究工作完了才恢復。　　超聲波可能用晶體集中於一點，正如放大鏡把太陽光焦聚一般，有同樣結果。一張紙放在射綫中會起火。　　雖然這些舉例似乎够危險足以製造死聲。但事實上將來超聲波必被用來活人多於殺人。德國人曾想用聲波製成武器，但他們的結論也是說不實用。因為超聲波在空氣　進仃時很快地喪失效能成力。頻率一萬週一秒的聲波在空氣中行了七百呎後减少一半。但在水裏則要走二百四十哩後才少一半。因這個道理，超聲波不能用來殺死對方軍士或擊落敵機。「犧牲品」只有在和發生器同一室內才能受嚴重的影響。因為這波浪被牆壁和任何障碍物所阻。楊白的汽笛足够使他們在室內麻痺。但隔壁的隣人不覺到這騷擾。　　超聲波在死聲方面已證明不可能，那末對人類將來，牠有很大的發展，作為「生」的射綫。自由談旅程零拾  白永　　近來人事匆迫，幾天都在火車上度日，幸虧沒有趕上百分之八十五的加價，不然荷包更要空空了。從蘇州回上海，人總是那麼擠，據說下午有一班車，專門從蘇州開，掛在由無錫來的短程車後面，自然這不會沒有座位了，偏偏這天是星期日，據火車站的紅帽子講，這加軍週末兩天沒有。眞弄不淸是什麼緣故，週末是假期，人都要出外，為什麼反而沒有加車，剛好與外國的規矩相反，實在使人糊塗。於是我們買了二等票，擠上三等車，已是費了九牛二虎的力氣。更怪的是，朋友帶了幾斗米，因上海米貴，想藉此减少一點開支，不料車上不允許，說是貨物，必須按貨運交費。上海米價這兩天忽然漲了幾十萬，據說是受運費影營，難道國營的鐵路，就非得從這上面賺錢來維持嗎？　　車到外跨塘，上來幾個賣甘蔗和豆腐乾的，賣甘蔗是一大人一小孩，起先是大人兜售，每萬元四段，小孩來了，每萬三段，因小孩子的長些，剎那間，大人把價錢貶到每萬五段，小孩也隨之增到四段，並加說明道：「看貨色啊，介長也是一段，那長也是一段！」一面喃喃吶吶的駡，不料大人再貶價，小孩子也不示弱，於是在半點鐘之內，由每萬三四段一直跌到七八段，總算都賣光了。這回就輪到賣豆腐乾的，他們得一面賣一面注意車上的員司，如果有一個路警過來，立即捲起貨物坐在椅子上充旅客，其迅速簡直出乎我們想象。當然，也如式作着營業競爭，一霎時賣光了，便在車上點起鈔票來，一堆一堆的萬元票從全身口袋中掏出，理好，許多人目不轉睛的看着他倆，結果是每人的收人都在百萬以上，又到了一小站，分別作個鬼臉，跳下去了。這是我所看到的最切實的减價比賽，如果米店布店也有這麼一天，豈不大好？　　四月四日兒童節，我從南京回上海，居然有帶了小孩子白相鎭江金山寺的，幸而那天尙沒起火，不然可眞殺風景了。南京站上，距開軍還有一小時，坐位早已滿了，後來的只好站立，有一個公務員模樣的傢伙，看見一位中年母親帶了三個小孩坐一只椅子，便堅强的要求小孩子讓一座位給他，小孩自是不願意，他便嘻皮笑臉的說：「我只要到丹陽，你讓給我，下軍給你買東西吃。」小孩仍然不肯，並且哭了，那母親却和氣，强迫孩子下來，坐在皮箱上，丹陽客人洋洋自得的坐下去，一臉聲駑笑，拿出香烟來悠然吸上，再也不理孩子及其母親了。　　我一旁的坐位一直在變換着，最後是　一位到無錫的先生和他的同伴，不知為什麼，別人都在「爭坐位」，他們却互讓，在這種場合，虛情客氣只有使人厭煩，於是旁邊一位男客乘虛而入，同時一位女客也把提句放在這位子下面，無錫一到，男女就互搶，結果當然男人勝利，女人氣得一聲不響的立在一邊。到蘇州，男客又下去，不料位子又被一個彪形大漢坐下去，算是佔給他的女朋友的，那位女客敢怒而不敢言，就一直站到上海北站。這是什麼表現呢？—大槪這便是中國式的優勝劣敗，適者生存。至於Ladies　First，大約只有在空曠的客　中，三個客人而有十只沙發的時候，才可以應用罷？錢祠回溯  半夢老人　　「滿堂化醉三千客，一劍霜寒十四州。」此貫休僧送錢武肅王詩。當時武肅意氣不可一世，東南半壁，亦復倚苦長城。余來西湖，豔羡「柳浪聞鶯」四字之佳，瞻仰錢王祠勝蹟，惜乎柳色全無，啼鶯不再，祠中住滿武裝勇士，饗堂改作飯堂，俎豆馨香，舉行絕少。　　嗣余友人廣德錢文選士靑，為武肅第三十二世孫，發意重修，構桷丹朱，煥然一新，曾有自述詩云：「家聲武肅澤延綿，世變滄桑晚節堅，皓月不為雲霧蔽，好留清影照山川。安民保境溯前因，都是先王撫宇仁，千載西湖新廟貌，微文咸冀獄生申。」廟前遍植楊柳，漸可恢復　觀，從此燕語鶯啼，得與萬古英雄，同為湖山生色。　　武肅生於臨安，誕時聞甲馬聲，父欲棄於井，祖母不許，故井名「婆留」。幼與羣兒戲，端坐石上指揮，如佈陣勢，錢君云：「茅山池內久潛龍，天挺賢豪問氣鍾，甲馬聲喧光繞戶，華樞誕降彩雲濃。王考驚看欲棄遺，主持留養賴重慈，報劉異日償宏願，井號婆留勝蹟埀。綺年樹下戲　兒，指晝居然是導師，後日登壇軍令肅，豈知石上植初基。」皆詠此事。錢君久綰榷符，曾為歐洲留學生監督，學貫中西，功業　滇冀浙皖鄂閩各省，繩武濟世，相得益彰。　　顧武肅生性至孝，其母喜游三層　，常負母以登，　時，用　木作小枕，綴鈴其上，睡熟則　，　響而　，謂之警枕，大有臥薪嘗膽之意。張船山詩云：「我聞　越當年兵馬雄，覇才獨守錢江東，坐看五代等兒戲，干戈纂亂殊怱怱。父子祖孫史及弟，四王三世傳忠懿，虎視耽耽不負嵎，迎周歸宋知天意。」自來雄峙江左，虎負一隅，而能以民命為重，識機順大，如　　一家，　　史中　　有也。　　余生平崇拜英雄，西湖上除岳鄂王顧外，當推錢王祠，曾有詠武肅詩云：「一片紅光照九霄，天生奇彥挺中朝，吳山立盡驍雄雄，之水飛餘大海　，十四方州橫寳劍，三千强弩射寒潮，只今浩劫東南滿，屛陣人豪久寂寥。」鑒於外患內憂，相續不泯，顧瞻廟貌，景仰前　，不禁神往久之。賞櫻會  俞劍華　　四月六日，上海黨政團當局以靑年團部中櫻花盛開，特柬邀各界作賞櫻之會。余不見櫻花已十有餘年，遂亦欣然而往。團部位於復興中路中正南二路之隅，原係日人三井別墅，園佔地頗廣，所有布置除中間紅樓為西式外，俱係中國舊式園亭風度，並無小巧玲瓏之日本式點綴品，曲徑迴環，松柏蒼翠，綠草如　，楊柳吒金，一泓春水，小橋通焉。其幽邃蓊茂處之，望之無窮，林問路旁雜植櫻花數十百本，燦若列錦，微風一吹，落英繽紛，膏髮沾袖，遊人為之悠然神往。時天氣淸和，士女雜遝，申報攝影記者俞創碩君在櫻花樹下，將皤然老叟，紅顏少女，盡攝入鏡頭　　櫻之為花，不紅不白，色極平淡，開則萬朶齊放，毫無含蓄，不及十日，便已敗殘，若遇狂風暴雨，則頃刻可盡，所謂「其興也暴，其亡也忽」，日人尊為國花，其性固相近也。若以花品論，則梅之孤高，杏之富麗，梨之潔白，海棠之秀雅，皆較櫻為勝。梅與櫻其形相去一間耳，而雅俗之別，不可以道里計，中日國民性之不同，亦可於此見之。　　徘徊園中，一片昇平氣象，儼如世內桃源，不知有生活之艱苦，不知有內戰之烽火，更無論日本之行將復興，第三次大戰之行將開幕，一切塵瀉俱為自然美景所淘洗，但「不知明年今日又在何處」，而此賞櫻盛會，能幾回開耳！談相人  止齋　　上月廿六日本刊「相人術」一文，提出相人的十二個標準，雖然有助於「知人之明」，但近於一種心理測驗，與普通所謂相人術者不同。普通所謂相人之術是只憑一副形相，就可以確定一個人屬於那個類型，從而預斷他的一生休咎的。並不需要從言語行動上去審察。晚淸官塲流行的相人「八字格」，是「同，田，貫，日。由，乃，發，身」。以人的整個形體的相狀，來配合這八個字形。「同」代表穩重，圓渾，魁偉，大度。「田」代表蹈實，剛毅，堅決，平正。「貫」代表秀拔，英挺，正直，敏銳。「日一是短小，精幹，玲瓏，剔透。「由乃發身」代表相反的劣相，「由」字形容獐頭鼠目一流人；「乃」是像曲腰拱背，「發」是膽腫肥滿，類似飯館掌櫃的。「身」則是代表虛弱歪邪的人。　　據說高等考試掄選縣長，最後決定時嘗有請幾位元老「看相」的事。憑人世經驗，從人相上看出個性的誠正奸邪，厚重刁猾，原是可能的事。因為人的精神變化，是一一記救在面貌上的。只是我們人類的知識，似乎還不够準確的了解自己罷了。美國監獄黑幕  毛毅　　在全美有四千多座州郡監獄，它們的任務相當於我國的拘留所，專門覊押待判的囚犯，關係重大的證人，和監禁輕罪的犯人。雖然如此，這類監獄却大多設備簡陋，黑幕重重。大部份的郡獄都是氣息難聞，光綫黯淡，囚房狹小，擁擠不堪；妓女，酒徒，烟犯，瘋子和兒童都雜居在一起。　　郡獄的主任常是一個祗曉得剝削囚犯的汚吏。尅扣口糧是郡獄主任的生財之道。有一個主任，習以為常的買進兩角錢一隻的不新鮮的饅頭，再以五六角的高價買給半飢餓的囚犯。　　美國郡獄之中也有「龍頭」，他們稱之為「法官」。因為監獄之內還有一個違法的法庭，名為「袋鼠法庭」，由龍頭操縱用來控制其他的囚犯，所以龍頭居然成了「法官。」通常龍頭都是最老最兇的囚犯，他們代理獄吏「管理」難友。　　新犯人剛進監房不久，便要再上「公堂」—袋鼠法庭。每一個新犯人都必需獻出一筆「孝敬」，金額從美金二元到二十五元不等。如果拿不出來，他就要「以役代鍰」來抵補，替龍頭做下賤的工作，而每一天所折合的工資低至一角錢，要做到「孝敬」的金額，才能停止服役。　　除此以外，還有許多陋規，龍頭的手中執有一把鞭子，使他有强制執行的威嚴。普通的囚犯如果犯了「打擾同獄者的交談」或者「未得允許而擅入囚屋」這類的「罪名」，挨龍頭二十或者五十鞭並不罕見。　　最近，曾有三千一百二十七所美國郡獄受過觀察，而被認為適於拘留囚犯的僅有五百所，還不到全數的六分之一。美國監獄情形之糟，可以想見。針鋒相對  公孫羊　　有一位藝術家，蓄有一頭愛犬，視同至寳。某日，發現它一足微跛，便專請某著名外科醫生診視。外科醫生到達後，發現病人竟是一頭犬，心中頗覺不平，但是外表上不露聲色，將犬檢視後，開立藥方，照出診例收費而去。　　幾天以後，這位藝術家從外科醫生那　接到一個電話，叫他立刻前去。他以為這一定與他愛犬的足疾有關，頓時丟開他的工作，匆匆趕到醫生的家中。醫生迎接他進去後，指着一把椅子，很斯文的說道：「我想請你把這一把椅子，作一幅畫像。驢肉絲  筱彭　　白水先生前「談吃」文內，談到吃火磚上的炙鴨掌，桌洞上的活猴腦，和數十口生猪脊等之珍品，這些吃法，不但是奢侈，實覺得太殘忍。但還有吃生割驢肉一塊，切成肉絲，炒而食之者。茲錄淸炯城姚伯昂（元之）竹葉亭離記一則如下：「朱孝廉雲錦，客揚州，同一庖人，王姓，自言幼時隨其師役於山西王中丞亶望署中，王喜食驢肉絲，廚中有專侗驢者，蓄數驢，肥而健，中丞食時，若傳言　驢肉絲，則審視驢之腴處，刲取一　，烹以獻。驢刲處血淋漓，則以燒鐵焰之，血即止。」這種吃法，和吃炙鴨掌，生猴腦等，可以列入同類。小雨點  施濟美　　後生小子，嫌他乳臭未乾，不足與道也。、　　漸漸的，後生小子長成了大人先生，乳臭乾了，—乾得連人味兒也沒有了。　　一張報，一年能出幾次號外？　　一個人，一生之中能有幾次大笑？又幾次痛快的大哭？　　一滴水，滴入大海裏，沒有了，但它還是水。　　一滴水，落在石頭上，有一塊水跡子，太陽出來，把它晒乾了。　　用衣飾和化妝品打扮自己的是第二流美容家；第一流美容家，他們用虛偽的誠擎，做作的天眞，殘毒的慈悲，狠惡的仁愛，狡猾的忠厚……作他的裝飾。　　冬天去了，太陽說：「從今天起，我要被人類憎嫌了……」它還依依於那曾被寵愛的日子。　　人類是奇異的生物，在這種生物的心中：天下沒有比愛過的東西更可恨可惡的了。　　「當你看見任何一個人的時候，不要忘記了要對他笑一笑……」這是一處世哲學」的第一章，成人教育中最精彩的一節。清明過松隱弔陳陶遺  白蕉　　長憶無言歎式微，靜觀盤錯願多違，破空一塔昏鴉繞，松隱先生去不歸—　　古木紅牆小院深，談經人去圍玄音。洞橋植杖看雲黑，賸覺江湖萬里心！　　雜句　　席暖耽醫坐雨時，閒麼客椀有遐思，唐梅洛盡山前路，只是頻年未入詩。　　紹黃瀘白味堪尋，杯底曾銷一寸心，野老何須驚世路，十年小樹尙成林。逍遙花  陳慎言　　第十四章　逍遙海上　（一二三）　　徐老太太一聽這話，發急道：「她怎麼不許你回去呀？這是什麼道理？把她叫回來問問。」毓如忙阻住道：「你別着急，其中原因我可想像的出來，一定是渚齋有對不住她的地方，才會如此。」說着又向渚齋道：「這次你總算受了一番敎訓了，時髦女子，非我寒素之家所能供養得起，要了這樣女子，要為終身之累。鳳笙雖然不大時髦，却是舊家子女，持家相夫，必能克盡厥職，有這樣內助，你無內顧之憂，可以放膽在外面創造事業，你要明白這一點。至你心裏還有一人，就是章雲卿，你得想明白，雲卿見你已經娶親了，那能再嫁給你，你打算先和鳳笙離婚，然後她嫁給你，她是名門閨秀，必不肯出此下策，你快把這妄想打消了罷！現在你只盡你的心，幹你的事，一步一步向上邁進，機會來時，自會發展，不要想到外埠去，目前外埠也沒有好機會。你母親又多病，你也不宜離開。鳳笙現在氣頭上，不允許你回去，我聽說你早已住在銀行宿舍，一時又何必回去！家庭中必須把意氣消除，才能和陸，她不贊成你回去，你就暫住在宿舍，等到她意氣平復，自會來接你。」渚齋恭聽老父一番敎訓，此時在重大剌激之後，也深自後悔，當下說道：「父親說的話，我都記得，我以後絕不會再作軌外的事，埋頭幹我應幹的事。」毓如道：「如此我就放心了，但是你也不能因一時失意，把興致消滅，公餘之暇，仍要找點娛樂消遣，怡養心神，你不是愛唱戲嗎？可以常到肖柏姑丈家裏請敎，或是請他介紹一位名師指點你，不過這是一種業餘消遣，不要沈測其中。」渚齋唯唯答應，這一天渚齋在父母跟前，依營一天，吃過晚飯才回宿舍去。那晚上躺在牀上，靜靜想一想，覺得老父這一番敎訓，很有道理，一向專憑自己感情作用，不曾為他人設想，第一對父母方面就未曾略盡孝道，自撫養而至成立，只有累父母操心，自己何曾幹過一宗好事，博得父母歡顏？絲粉  何島　　第二次大戰前，義大利有一位名字叫做何滋的科學家，在米蘭的實騐室中進行着一項試騐，他用絲的織維磨成極細的粉末，想把它做成一種可以用來祛除化學藥品臭味的藥劑。　　忽然他的一位女助手的一綹鬈　給一陣風吹得掉在額前，她順手把頭髮一撫，無意中乎上的「絲粉」沾到了臉上，她祇覺得那種粉輕軟非凡，搽在臉上十分潤滑舒服，便爽性把它當作「乾粉」，大大的搽了起來。　　何滋靈機一動，結果是發明了一種理想的「乾粉」！　　他說，這種「絲粉」比普通化粧用的香粉高明得多：第一，牠的分量比普通粉輕一倍；第二，粉末極細，決不會阻塞皮膚上的毛孔；第三，牠的吸水性特强，吸汗極易，能够袪除人體出汗時不愉快的氣味。而且牠很容易粘在皮膚　，所以在搽用前用不着先搽冷　之類的「粉底」。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Vice Chairman Sun and his wife hosted a banquet for all the women National Assembly representatives on the 11th, delivering a speech on the women's issue in China. He first recounted the women's movements in countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, and France, as well as the legislative process for women's equality under the law after the establishment of the Republic of China. He then stated that the women's rights in our country today have surpassed those of advanced countries such as Britain and the United States. The number of female members in the US Federal Congress and the British Parliament is very small, while our National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution both have more than one-fourth of female National Assembly representatives and legislators. In this regard, Sun advocated that the number of women in various departments such as the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Examination Yuan should also be stipulated by law. He also believed that it is not enough for women to only strive for political rights at the central level. He advocated that when each province formulates its own autonomous provincial constitution in the future, there should also be clear regulations on women's participation in local political power. Finally, Sun proposed in an impassioned tone that if women were to rule the country and the world, the country would be peaceful and the world would have peace. He said that during World War I, US President Wilson proposed a slogan for the US's participation in the war: "To end war with war," believing that after the end of World War I, the world could achieve peace from then on. But the result was not as Wilson imagined. World War II broke out not long after. Therefore, he said that if the world is still ruled by men in the future, the world will never have peace. Only when women are in power can the country be stable and the world have peace, because women do not like to fight wars, they love their families, they love their children, and they love peace most. Governing the country with this kind of mentality will naturally prevent the recurrence of war. After Sun's speech, the women representatives spoke one after another, expressing their support and hoping for his success in the vice presidential election, in order to realize his vision of women governing the country and saving world peace.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] President Yu Youren hosted National Assembly representatives from Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and overseas tonight. Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, Gan Naiguang, Liu Weizhi, and over 220 others attended. President Yu first gave a speech, outlining his views on the prospects of the new China, stating that there is a great hope for political transformation, but it must be completed with intensified efforts to suppress the rebellion under the Constitution.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Guangxi University Alumni Association in Beijing held a tea party on the 11th in the auditorium of the Youth Corps Headquarters, inviting Li Zongren. Huang Xuchu, Li Yunhua, Lei Yinyin, Chen Jiantiao, and over a hundred others attended. Li gave a speech, briefly stating that Guangxi University was founded and grew up in hardship and difficulty, but has not reached the ideal level. He said: "I have always attached great importance to education. When I was the chairman of the Wuhan Political Branch during the 17th year of the Republic [1928], I allocated 200,000 yuan from extremely difficult financial circumstances as the start-up funding for Wuhan University. The Xiang and E Provinces banks also helped to raise funds at that time in order to establish it. This is enough to prove that I have never neglected the construction of education, culture, and economy." After Li recounted Guangxi's contributions to the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance, he stated that for the future of China, he believes that military affairs should be the short-term solution, and political and economic reforms should be the fundamental solution. He also said: "This reform must start from the central government, so those responsible for the central government should not only have the determination to reform, but also have correct and appropriate plans. My motives for participating in the vice presidential election are to advocate for a democratic atmosphere and to fulfill my sense of responsibility to the country. I am willing to use my experience of over 30 years in military and political work to assist the head of state and start from the central government to engage in thorough reform. If I am elected vice president, I am willing to be a bridge between the people and the government, so that the opinions of all parties can be conveyed to the head of state for adoption." Li continued: "The struggle against the Communist bandits is not a simple military struggle, but a political struggle, that is, the struggle between the Three Principles of the People and Communism. Therefore, if we cannot implement the Three Principles of the People, even if we defeat the Communist bandits, we will not be able to obtain unanimous support. As for the Principle of People's Livelihood, the equalization of land ownership and the regulation of capital have not only failed to be implemented today, but powerful families and capital have taken the opportunity to rise, accumulating vast wealth, turning the Chinese society from a division of large and small poverty into a phenomenon where the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. Therefore, today, it is not enough to clear out the capital of powerful families to appease public anger and to show the government's determination to reform the economy. I also believe that this political and economic reform movement is a unanimous demand of the whole country, so it will inevitably be successful, and it will inevitably achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country through political and economic reforms." Finally, Li analyzed the future international situation and said that China's future foreign policy must adhere to the principle of independence and autonomy, and internally it must eliminate the Communist bandits and maintain China's non-Communist status, and then serve as the mainstay for safeguarding Asian security.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Panyang, 11th] The Northeast bandits are frequently maneuvering, and there are clear signs that a great battle will break out in late April. In the month since the bandits captured Siping, they have been quickly reorganizing and replenishing their forces, and the strength of the Guomindang troops is also increasing day by day. North and south of Shenyang, bandits are roaming again within 100 li. Fierce fighting has been taking place since the 10th in the areas of Hualiuqibao, Jiumen, and Sanmianpan on the north bank of the Liao River. The First Division of the Eighth Column of the bandits invaded from Faku and was severely beaten by the Guomindang troops.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the issue of the use of US$463 million in US aid, it is still awaiting decision. In addition to the US$125 million to be used entirely for the purchase of military supplies, the remaining US$338 million will be used to formulate a list of materials to be purchased based on the needs of economic construction. However, the quotas of the relevant agencies are still to be agreed upon. According to government officials on the 11th, it is still under consideration whether this step will be completed before the Executive Yuan is handed over, or whether the funds will be transferred directly to the cabinet after the implementation of the constitution. It is learned that the initial negotiations on the bilateral agreement on which the use of this loan is based are underway in Washington. Ambassador Gu and Bei Zuyi's visit to US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett on the 9th was also for this purpose. Even if the completion of this agreement can be realized soon, the submission of our country's application plan may still need to be submitted by the new cabinet after the implementation of the Constitution, because Zhang Qun has repeatedly stated that he does not intend to lead the first Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution, and it is not appropriate for him to preemptively handle the use of funds related to this major economic plan.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the illness of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, all parties are very concerned. The reporter specially visited Lin Kesheng, director of the Military Medical Department of the Ministry of National Defense, who told him that Chen had suffered from duodenal ulcer in the past. After being ordered to go to the Northeast in September last year, he overworked himself due to the heavy responsibility and cold climate. In less than three weeks, his old illness relapsed. Later, due to overwork while ill, the illness worsened. Lin continued that when Chairman Chiang personally inspected the Northeast in January this year, he witnessed Chen's illness and knew that it was impossible to recover without moving to another place for recuperation, so he decided to reassign Wei Lihuang to take over and ordered Chen to return south. Chen returned to Beijing in early February and went to the US military hospital for examination. The results showed that it was impossible to fully recover without a longer period of recuperation. Chen then went to Shanghai at the end of February for intermittent treatment. Lin also said that the results of Chen's illness examination have been reported to Chairman Chiang at any time. Chairman Chiang has approved his short-term trip to the United States for treatment. The reporter then asked about Chen's trip abroad for treatment, which has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers and is of concern to all parties, and wondered when it would be possible to go. He was told that Chen had previously been too weak to endure the hardship of long-distance travel. Now, after more than a month of recuperation, his physical strength has improved considerably. He plans to go to the United States for fundamental treatment. Before going to the United States, he also plans to return to Beijing to ask the Chairman for instructions and it is heard that he has earnestly resigned from his current position.</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Main Trend of Hebei Politics <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yang Bingsen</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Baoding Eighth Dispatch] The situation in Hebei today is quite unusual, with provincial affairs presenting a multitude of complexities. However, a glimmer of hope has emerged, indicating how to start the work. Chu Xichun, the Chairman of Hebei Province, clearly understands the crux of the provincial administration and thus dares to have confidence, acting as soon as he knows. I remember that when Mr. Chu took office more than two months ago, he first announced a minimum and most practical and essential provincial administration implementation outline. The first central task of provincial administration is to fully support military development with political power, and he emphasized: The goal of administrative facilities is the people, rights should belong to the people, benefits should accrue to the people, we must promote politics with military force, consolidate the people's power with politics, and seek comprehensive development with the people's power, nurturing points and lines with the comprehensive, and then supporting the comprehensive with points and lines, advancing in different ways.</p>
<p>Military-Political Coordination</p>
<p>The main task of military-political coordination is to support local teams with regular troops, to support people's self-defense organizations with local teams, that is, to coordinate the people's self-defense forces with local teams, and to support regular troops with teams, in a mutually cyclical coordination, to eliminate the communist bandits. In terms of organizing and training the masses, it is necessary to reach the point where everyone is a soldier in times of trouble and everyone is a civilian in times of peace. Under the principle of unconditional full administrative cooperation with the military, in addition to regular troops, the provincial government plans to establish 22 security regiments throughout the province, two-thirds of the funds for which will be provided by the central government and one-third by local resources. In addition, guerrilla suppression teams will be established in the inspectorate commissioner districts to be responsible for directing the security teams to carry out guerrilla suppression tasks. Clean-up teams will be established in each county to undertake the task of clearing out remaining bandits within the county area, without moving. As for the grassroots organizations in the countryside, people's self-defense teams will be established, but they will not be allowed to break away from production. The current administrative work in Hebei Province is fully and actively unfolding in this direction.</p>
<p>Land Review</p>
<p>In order to counter the communist bandits' "land policy" and "locust policy," the Hebei authorities are using organization against organization, and using the people and methods to launch the land policy of "land to the tillers" and the "refugee reclamation movement." At the recent Hebei military-political review meeting, it was decided to gradually implement livelihood policies in the recovered areas, starting with the distribution of land. "Land Rights Equalization Committees" have been universally established in various counties to be responsible for implementation, but the committee is entirely composed of owner-farmers and tenant farmers, handling the distribution of land that has been illegally handled. Although the ownership of landlords is preserved in principle, except for those with self-cultivation ability, all others are distributed to tenant farmers, and land bonds are issued, guaranteed by the government, for tenant farmers to pay off the land price within fifteen or twenty years, but without interest. However, landlords who do not participate in the bandit suppression work will no longer have their ownership recognized, but will be confiscated and made public. Factories and mines will also be managed by workers, who will also receive profits, to ensure that the middle class is protected, the lower class is supported, and the upper class is restricted, so that the poor can become rich, the rich can be at peace, and everyone can work together for production.</p>
<p>Refugee Reclamation</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to thoroughly relieve the refugees and eliminate the communist bandits' "locust policy" and to encourage refugees to engage in production, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided to launch a refugee reclamation movement. Recently, the Relief Association and the Social Affairs Department have reached an agreement with the Hebei Reclamation Farm and the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Field Bureau, deciding to allocate 10,000 mu of cultivated wasteland in Chadian, east of Tianjin, and Junchang. All good people from the counties under the province who are refugees and have agricultural production skills can participate in this reclamation work, and three thousand households will be selected in Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, and Tangshan and transported to the two places in batches to form cooperative farms composed of refugees. The methods are: (1) After the refugees arrive at the destination, the responsible party will borrow temples, schools, and empty houses for them to live in; (2) Refugees apply for land, temporarily limited to five mu per person or ten mu per household; (3) Those who apply for cultivated land can obtain permanent tenancy rights, but must participate in self-cultivation and must not hire workers or sublet to others. In addition, agricultural tools will be provided and the necessary production materials will be distributed.</p>
<p>Spring Famine Relief</p>
<p>Due to years of banditry, the rural areas of Hebei Province are generally experiencing a serious spring famine. Liu Yaozhang, the Speaker of the Hebei Provisional Council, recently inspected the Pinghan and Beining roads and the suburbs of Pingjin, and said publicly: If this year's spring cultivation problem (including able-bodied men, livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, and production costs) is not solved, I believe that next year's food panic will inevitably double, and people's lives will be unimaginable. He believes that we should quickly disperse the able-bodied men concentrated in cities or county towns back to engage in production, and the central and local governments should jointly find ways to provide relief or subsidies in terms of livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, and production costs as much as possible. In addition, we can use work relief methods to engage in well digging and canal opening.</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly relieve the spring famine, the Hebei Provincial Government is actively handling agricultural loans and cotton loans. This year, the province's agricultural loans have been approved for 230.5 billion yuan from the Agricultural Bank, and another 101.5 billion yuan will be distributed by the Central Cooperative Treasury, of which 75 billion yuan will be used as food production loans, 100 billion yuan will be used as cotton loans, 14 billion yuan will be used for small-scale water conservancy projects, and a total of 41.5 billion yuan will be used for other agricultural production and land loans.</p>
<p>Grasping the Driving Force</p>
<p>General Fu Zuoyi recently said very sincerely: Although the current situation in Hebei is very serious, we are not pessimistic. On the other hand, it is also an opportunity for development, as long as we can grasp the driving force of the new development. Where is the power of new development? That is the people. In the bandit areas, we must rely on the power of military-political coordination to save the people. In the national army areas, we must strive for local stability. The provincial government must seek development based on the demands of the people and the interests of the people. Therefore, the current Hebei provincial administration is doing everything possible to win the trust and love of the people and mobilize all the people's strength to engage in the work of suppressing bandits and restoring order.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Special Article: On the Importance of Independent Exploration <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>Since Renault's farcical escape back to the United States, academic circles in our country have expressed indignation and advocated completing the exploration of the Jishi Mountains independently. The Central Aviation Corporation is also willing to send a special plane from Shanghai or Nanjing to Lanzhou at no cost to carry exploration personnel and exploration equipment to the Jishi Mountains to complete the unfinished work of the Renault expedition. However, due to practical difficulties, the plan for independent exploration had to be temporarily abandoned, and members of our country's exploration team have successively returned to Nanjing from Lanzhou. We cannot help but express our regret for this matter and hope that our scientific community will continue to work hard. I have long advocated independent exploration and hope to expand the scope of independent exploration in the future. I would like to say a word to the Chinese scientific community on this issue.</p>
<p>When the so-called "Renault Expedition" came to China in late January this year, I, based on the standpoint of a scientist, wrote an article entitled "On the Arrival of the Renault Expedition in China" because the matter was abrupt and the behavior was unlike a scientific expedition. It was published in the "Weekly Forum" of this newspaper on February 2. First, it pointed out that the organization of the team was unsound, the nature and purpose were unclear, the itinerary date was uncertain, the team members were uncoordinated, and the supply of materials was not well prepared. It was predicted early that "it is inevitable to be unprepared." Second, it was argued that Renault was a businessman with no exploration experience. After coming to China, he promoted "atomic pens" everywhere. Therefore, it was confirmed that "the team has a strong commercial advertising color, rather than a purely scientific exploration." Finally, it cited previous foreign expeditions to China, where "they did not abide by the agreement or our country's laws, and disputes arose." Be cautious from the beginning. My humble opinion may be alarmist, but I also hope to arouse the attention of our country's scientific authorities. I have no other purpose, but I was not clearly understood. Instead, friends spread rumors that "the matter is related to Sino-US scientific cooperation, and those who do not know the content should not make wild comments." I believe that in this democratic era, freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution. Everyone loves their country, just like me. "Only officials are allowed to light lamps" is regrettable.</p>
<p>Now, this long-publicized "Sino-US Jishi Mountain Exploration Team," after several delays, has become unbearable. On April 1, Renault unilaterally tore up the exploration plan due to his non-compliance with the "agreement." Our side's attempt to cooperate in the exploration, after several preparations, ended without success, not only costing a lot of money but also giving the Chinese team members a major mental blow, which should arouse the indignation of the Chinese people. Renault also disregarded our country's laws, undermined sovereignty, and violated international air law by privately flying away, with various illegal actions emerging one after another, like a legendary drama, scene after scene. Regardless of Renault's dishonorable behavior, which has become a laughingstock at home and abroad and will be subject to sanctions in his own country, this kind of scam is a great joke. It is exploration in name, but smuggling in reality. For our country, especially the scientific community, it is a great insult. At the same time, it is also a major stain on the American scientific community. Our country's scientific community should express a solemn statement to avoid the recurrence of similar Renault incidents. The fair remarks made by Mr. Shekai, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, on the 5th of this month are greatly appreciated. The development of the incident to this point is no longer a purely scientific cooperation and exploration issue. Regarding the destruction of laws and the infringement of sovereignty, it should be resolved through proper diplomatic channels. As for how to negotiate and how to deal with the aftermath, the authorities should be able to handle it well. We "do not know the content" and do not dare to say more, otherwise, it will only increase the feeling of "unfortunately, the prediction came true."</p>
<p>Learning from the past, we should be careful in the future. After being deceived in this way, we don't know whether to laugh or cry. In the future, when we encounter similar international cooperation incidents, we should "be cautious in our actions and avoid repeating the same mistakes." Furthermore, we deeply feel the importance of independence and self-reliance. Cooperation is sometimes unreliable. Now, in order to implement the Jishi Mountain exploration, we should make persistent efforts, expand the organization, redeploy, and continue to proceed. The Academia Sinica should still take overall leadership, and the Ministry of Education, National Defense, Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, Economy, and Resources should cooperate and assist. Mobilize scientific organizations such as the Science Society of China, the Chinese Society of Natural Sciences, the Central Geological Survey, the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute, and the Chinese Geological, Geographical, Meteorological, Physical, Animal, Botanical, Mineral, and Ethnic Societies, and related agencies should participate as one. Request the Air Force Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense to borrow special exploration planes and pilots, and concentrate on the scientific instruments needed, such as radar. Such a large-scale exploration of the western mountainous area through concerted efforts will surely be successful and is necessary. The significance of this time and place is extraordinary. First, it can show the independence of Chinese science and technology and that external force is not necessary. Second, it can wash away the shame of this incident and correct the international perception. Third, it can make a real academic contribution, determine the height of the main peak of Jishi Mountain, and permanently preserve its original name. It is beneficial in many ways and should not be hesitated. Twelve academic groups in Lanzhou also have suggestions for independent exploration, which shows that people of insight in the scientific community have similar views. I hope that the scientific authorities will actively carry out and organize it in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Not only that, scientific exploration can increase human knowledge and develop natural resources. All observations of astronomy and meteorology, investigations of mountains, rivers, and geology, exploration of the oceans, searches for animals, plants, and minerals, and interviews of races and customs are the responsibility of scientific explorers. Therefore, the sky is the limit, and the sea is boundless, reaching far and wide, exploring the strange and seeking the new, and inspiring the mysterious. Scientifically advanced countries have done this for the most part, and the achievements have been particularly remarkable in the last three hundred years. The North and South Poles have been visited by explorers. Our country's people are usually cautious and mature at a young age, lacking a spirit of adventure. Not to mention distant places, even the famous mountains and rivers, border areas, and hinterland of our country have not been explored, so that great resources are abandoned on the ground, and the people's livelihood is scarce.</p>
<p>Our country is blessed by nature, located in the cold, temperate, and tropical zones, with vast land and abundant resources, varying from north to south, with different climates and many ethnic groups. Science is developing late, and research is not yet complete. For the current plan, we should first organize various survey, inspection, exploration, collection, visit, and investigation teams to go to various places, especially the border areas, to conduct detailed field research. As for mountain exploration, which has not been heard of in our country before, we should encourage and reward young scientists, provide them with specialized training, and send them to the Pamirs, Himalayas, Altai, Tianshan, and Hinggan Mountains to conduct various scientific studies, not just the Jishi Mountains. However, overall planning depends on a central agency to manage the matter, and the organization of the Chinese Exploration Association is urgently needed to concentrate manpower and financial resources to make it easier to achieve the goal. In view of this, I am ashamed of my insignificance and wrote an article entitled "Exploration, Development, and Scientific Research" (published in "Science," Volume 29, Issue 8, August 1947, published by the Science Society of China) to call for it. I hope that government authorities, social elites, and scientific experts will understand the importance of exploration and development for the great cause of nation-building, jointly launch it, and quickly promote it.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Yang Zishou and four other reporters from Chongqing set off from Chongqing on the 6th and arrived in Wanyuan, the main peak of the Daba Mountains, on the 9th. The mission of the reporter group is to investigate the defense situation of the Daba Mountains on the spot, and the scheduled trip is two weeks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wanyuan, 10th] The reporter arrived in Wanyuan by car with Division Commander Fang in the afternoon of the 9th. The county is an important city connecting the Daba Mountains, surrounded by high mountains, and the terrain is dangerous. In 1935, the communist bandit Xu Xiangqian occupied the county for more than a year. The county originally had more than 300,000 residents, but after the massacre by Xu's bandits, there are now only more than 100,000 residents, and most of them are people who moved from Shaanxi and Hubei. The county residents have tasted the brutality of the communist bandits in the past and hate them to the bone. Therefore, the anti-communist consciousness is very strong. In order to prevent the intrusion of the communist bandits, a self-defense committee has been established. Wanyuan has a vast area and sparse population, and there is more wasteland than cultivated land, so there are very few disputes between tenant farmers and landlords. This reporter traveled from the Yu-Han Highway through Linshui and Dazhu to Wanyuan and deeply felt that the closer to the Daba Mountains, the more stable the people's hearts became.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Penghu, 11th] The Penghu Scientific Investigation Team is currently divided into groups to conduct investigations on various islands and is scheduled to return to Kaohsiung on the 15th. The Penghu County Government recently sent a memorandum to the team, outlining the three major difficulties in the county and requesting them to appeal on their behalf: (1) Penghu produces no rice. Even in good years, agricultural products such as sweet potatoes and sorghum are only enough for four months of consumption. Last year, there was both drought and typhoon, making the shortage even more severe, and cries of hunger are heard everywhere. The total population of Penghu County is over 34,000 people. Calculating a minimum ration of 15 catties per person per month, over 1 million catties of rice are needed. With a grain shortage for eight months of the year, 9 million catties of rice are needed annually, which must rely on supplies from Taiwan Island. (2) Penghu's transportation relies solely on four small vessels with a load capacity of 20 tons. In winter, the winds are fierce, and often transportation is cut off for a month. Among the county's 64 islands, transportation to each island is also hindered by a lack of ships, and official documents and government orders cannot arrive for over a month. The Penghu Motor Company originally provided land transportation, but due to a lack of gasoline, all routes are currently suspended. (3) The Penghu ice factory, fish market, fishing port oil depot, and shipyard were damaged during the war and have not yet been restored. Furthermore, fishing boats and fishing gear are difficult to replace, leading to a stagnant fishing industry. Although there is a vocational school for fisheries, most graduates are unemployed.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Recently, a beautiful wedding invitation suddenly appeared in the city, stating that Feng Yunchu's son, Guoliang, was to marry Ms. Qian Sujuan on April 8th at the Kangle Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai. The return addresses on the envelopes included the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shen Bao editorial department, the Central Trust Bureau, the China Transportation Company, and No. 133 Xinsheng Road, Wuxi. Various factories, shops, and those acquainted with Mr. Feng in the city received these invitations and sent gifts. By the evening of the 7th, Mr. Feng received news in Shanghai and immediately telegraphed the Wuxi Daily to request the publication of an advertisement denying the event, exposing this fraudulent scheme to extort money, and informing relatives and friends not to be deceived. However, because Mr. Feng has a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, friends, relatives, and heads of institutions in Wuxi had already sent gifts on the 6th and 7th, and were left both laughing and crying upon seeing yesterday's advertisement. As this case has attracted considerable attention from the community, the reporter made a special trip to Xinsheng Road yesterday to investigate. It is understood that the case was perpetrated by a "heroin gang." The person in charge is Qian Zixin, the landlord of the premises, whose father, Qian Hemei, was previously detained by the county government due to a drug case. Fortunately, the discovery was made early, and the police have already arrested the perpetrators. However, the main culprit and his accomplices have all fled.</p>

<h3 id="e48">United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information - A Chaotic Scene <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Representatives Shouting, Chairman Gaveling</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Geneva, 1st] As the Conference on Freedom of Information progressed, many national representatives began to feel fatigue, monotony, and boredom, like the feeling of "fatigue bombing." Mr. Cheng Cangbo was the first to feel annoyed by those debates that lacked news value and focused on the diplomatic nature of the "two fronts." He walked ten minutes back to the hotel from the meeting every day, eating while shouting "Nonsense." William Tyferry, a colleague from the U.S., special correspondent for the European edition of the New York Herald Tribune, also kept saying "Boring, boring." I saw that his telegram back to Paris said: "The two fronts are too distinct, like thousands upon thousands of other international conferences, with little hope of achievement."</p>
<p>Young Representatives Complaining</p>
<p>However, although the interest in the conference hall was not intense, the verbal jousting never subsided. After the artillery fire from the Netherlands, the young representative from Romania followed suit and complained in the First Committee. He strongly criticized the absurd and outrageous reports in the New York Herald Tribune, which he said infringed on Romania's national interests. He said: "British and American journalists never arrive in Romania with good intentions." He said that an American Christian Science Monitor reporter named Magen wrote reports that were full of insults to Romania, not only reactionary but also capitalist running dogs and war profiteers. He said: British and American newspapers have never reported on the economic recovery and construction of Southeast Europe. Their reporters in Romania enjoy full freedom and protection, but they never pick the good aspects to write about, and only make friends with people who oppose the government, using their rumors and lies as news material.</p>
<p>The Romanian representative also said: Government control of the news media is not necessarily a bad thing; the main thing is to see whether the government is democratic or fascist. The Greek representative believed that Romania intended to openly insult them. He said: "The Greek government was legally elected by the people. It is a democratic government." He urged the conference to pay attention to who are the lovers of peace and who are the aggressors. The Romanian delegation deliberately laughed loudly, and the chairman banged the gavel, creating a chaotic scene. The Czech representative stood up loudly and shouted: "The Greek representative has raised a point of order; he himself is a disruptor of order!" The Yugoslav representative said: "If the Greek representative feels insulted, then please, Chairman, pay attention to the insult the American representative made to the Czech Republic on the first day!" Several other representatives wanted to join the "melee." The clever chairman of the subcommittee announced a "recess" in the midst of the uproar.</p>
<p>Who Strangles Freedom of Information</p>
<p>The next day, the British chief representative, McLean, gave a very vivid speech in which he thoroughly condemned the "Slavic bloc countries" for strangling freedom of information. On the other hand, he spoke extensively about the history of the British struggle for freedom of information. Then he spoke of the British idea of freedom of information. He said that British society regards newspapers as a kind of free enterprise. Newspaper owners, editors, and reporters are like the owners, clerks, and workers of a company. They all have union relations with each other. They value their reputation and cherish their profession. Newspapers can report freely and express opinions freely. The government never controls or guides them, but because there is more than one newspaper, there is an opportunity for mutual correction and mutual rebuttal. He said: "For example, if London's conservative Daily Mail makes a mistake in its news reporting or exaggerates its opinions excessively, the Labour Party's London Daily Herald will definitely criticize or rebut it. Conversely, if the Daily Herald is wrong, the Daily Mail will also criticize it!" He said humorously: "Even if neither newspaper is wrong, the Communist Daily Worker will definitely refute them!" The whole venue burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Basic Concepts and Distinctions</p>
<p>"But," McLean said passionately, "If Moscow's Pravda makes a mistake in its reporting, who will correct it? Who will criticize it?" He said: This is the fundamental distinction between freedom of information and lack of freedom. He wanted the representatives of the Slavic bloc to calmly examine this fundamental concept.</p>
<p>McLean and the U.S. delegation shared the view that the conference should sign a convention on the concept of freedom of information that would be jointly observed by the world.</p>
<p>The Proposal on Passport Visas</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation put forward a major proposal in the Second Committee regarding the issue of passport visas for foreign journalists, as well as freedom of travel and freedom of access to information, which sparked a very heated debate. The Yugoslav representative, Dedijer, said that the U.S. representative was slapping himself in the face. "Why does the U.S. government repeatedly refuse visa requests from reporters for Communist newspapers?" Dedijer cited the story of the refusal of a visa to a reporter from the Paris "Humanité" (Communist newspaper) as evidence. The debate was then joined by representatives from Poland, the United Kingdom, India, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and France. Deng Youde, the Chinese representative to the Second Committee, supported the U.S. proposal and stated that the Chinese government has always given foreign journalists the greatest convenience in entering and leaving the country. Because he spoke in Chinese, he aroused considerable interest from the entire venue amid the weary debate. (At the Strasbourg Hotel)</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Chen Peide, the owner of Chen Xingji Meat Shop in Qiangou Town, Xixiang, had a conflict with a retired soldier stationed there over the purchase of lard on the morning of the 8th. Unexpectedly, not long after, he was suddenly beaten to death by dozens of burly men wielding iron rods and other weapons. His ribs were also broken. The manner of his death was extremely tragic. After this incident occurred, the town's merchants and residents were all indignant and went on strike collectively. They also sent representatives to the county government to petition, resolving to report the matter to the command headquarters for a thorough investigation. On the morning of the 10th, the local court specially dispatched Prosecutor Zhu to lead a coroner to the village for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased was covered in injuries, his ribs were broken, and his lower back was the most severely injured. It was determined that he had been beaten to death. After the autopsy, the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and await further investigation. Also, when her husband was being beaten, the deceased's wife saw a large man strike down with an iron rod. She used her right hand to block it, but unfortunately, it struck the tiger's mouth between her index finger, causing it to split open on the spot, with blood flowing freely. It is reported that the military authorities will severely punish the troublemakers.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Soviet Union Uses Veto Again - Blocks Italy from Joining United Nations - Has Caused Profound Reaction in Rome - Burma's Application for Membership Unanimously Approved by Security Council <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] After the Security Council voted nine to two today to approve Italy's application for membership, the Soviet Union exercised its veto power to cancel it. This is the 23rd time the Soviet Union has used its veto power in the Security Council, and the third time it has used its veto power to block Italy's application for membership. This move occurred just one week before Italy's general election on the 18th of this month, and is worthy of serious attention. The Security Council has decided not to continue voting on the applications for membership of Ireland, Portugal, Jordan, Finland, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Outer Mongolia, and will report the situation to the United Nations General Assembly, explaining that although the Security Council has re-examined the matter, the members have not changed their position from last year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] After Soviet representative Gromyko vetoed Italy's application to join the United Nations in the Security Council, U.S. representative to the Security Council Austin said afterwards that he would propose a system to give countries that have applied to join the United Nations and have already obtained the necessary majority support in the General Assembly and the Security Council the status of "associate members," allowing them to attend discussions on matters related to their country, but without the right to vote. Austin also stated that although this proposal arose because of the "unfair" treatment of Italy, it could still be applied to Portugal, Austria, Ireland, Jordan, and Finland, which have received the support of a large majority of members of the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] The reaction in Italian political circles to the Soviet Union's veto of Italy's accession to the United Nations was both swift and indignant, and undoubtedly a serious blow to the Communists on the eve of the election. The government said, "This was expected, but we still thought that the Soviet Union would not reject Italy for the third time on the eve of the general election, and let the Communists explain it themselves." The Communist Party had already indicated that it would support the Soviet veto unless the Soviet satellite states were also allowed to join at the same time. Political observers pointed out that because of the Soviet veto, all parties condemned the Italian Communist Party, and patriotic sentiment had reached a post-war peak. People were unwilling to listen to arguments in defense of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 10th] The Security Council today passed a resolution, with ten votes in favor and one abstention from Argentina, allowing Burma to become the 58th member state of the United Nations organization. Burma's application to join the United Nations was proposed by Chinese representative Xia Jinlin and was unanimously and enthusiastically supported by France, Britain, Belgium, Syria, Canada, and other countries. When submitting the proposal, the Chinese representative strongly stated that the economic and cultural ties between China and Burma are becoming increasingly strong. The Argentine representative stated that he was willing to abstain because he had not received instructions from his government.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Italian Election Battle - Enters Final Week - Nation Steps Up Security to Prevent Incidents <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 11th] Italy, amidst an atmosphere of nervous anticipation, has entered the final week of the heated election campaign. Small-scale violence has occurred sporadically in a wide range of areas, and the general fear that small sparks can start a prairie fire has made the situation even more tense. At the same time, it is generally believed that both the communist and non-communist sides will do their best to make surprising moves at the last minute before the general election next Sunday to win votes. The communist front is also planning two major national events that could cause disputes. The Communist Party, on the pretext of mourning the 36 union leaders who were assassinated in Sicily in the past two years, ordered a one-hour nationwide work stoppage on the 11th. The communist front also decided to convene a general meeting of representatives of unemployed workers from trade unions across the country on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The 11th is the last Sunday before Italy's general election on April 18th. Both the communist and anti-communist parties will hold meetings in major cities that day to make final campaign preparations. Military and police have been ordered to step up security to prevent incidents. The conference at the Milari Lego Theatre on the morning of the 11th will be addressed by Foreign Minister Sforza. In the afternoon, the Communist Party will hold a mass meeting in the cathedral square in the city, with addresses by General Cardona, commander of the Italian partisans during the war, and Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti. Three months ago, the Communist Party was in great momentum, with frequent strikes, and communist armed personnel even set up roadblocks and controlled grain transportation. This situation is now rare, and the Communist Party's power has gradually weakened. The main reason for this is that the Marshall Plan has had a psychological effect. [Reuters, London, 10th] Rome Radio reported that the British, French, and American Standing Bureau in Germany has issued special exit permits to Italians in Germany to enable them to return to their country to participate in the general election.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Prague, 10th (United Press)] The police authorities here have accused 46 former members of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party of engaging in underground activities and treason. They have separately issued public announcements listing the names of three groups of those arrested and the indictments. Two of the groups are accused of printing illegal newspapers and pamphlets. It is reported that this is the first time since the February Czechoslovak coup that the existence of an underground organization in the country has been acknowledged.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Since the Czechoslovak Communist Party seized power, thousands of democratic fighters have risked crossing the tightly guarded borders to escape abroad, including former Communist Minister of Health Beruhaste, Slovak Cabinet Prime Minister Lertiks, four Secretaries-General, and 19 Members of Parliament.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 11th] It is reported that when general elections are held in the U.S. military-occupied area of South Korea on May 10, two U.S. warships will be stationed in Korean ports. It is expected that all U.S. ground forces will be on alert and air force exercises will be conducted. The purpose of the U.S. military's show of force is to eliminate disturbances caused by leftists during the voting. The two warships will be dispatched from the U.S. Pacific Fleet; one, a cruiser, will be stationed in Seoul harbor, and the other, a destroyer, will be stationed in Busan. A radio station controlled by the North Korean Communist Party has demanded that all left-wing elements fight against the "general election" until "death." U.S. authorities have expressed fear that a riot may be brewing. To prevent serious incidents during the election, U.S. occupation officials are establishing their own power plants to supply electricity to South Korea.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Czechoslovakia has refused the Security Council's request for it to attend the Council's debate on the Czechoslovakian situation and to answer questions about the Communist Party's seizure of power in that country.

<h3 id="e56">Martial Law Declared in Northern Iran, Large Numbers of Communists Arrested, Conspiracy to Stage Coup in Early May Discovered <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 10th] The Iranian government today suddenly took security measures, arresting nearly 300 communists in the northern province of Mazandaran and declaring martial law in three cities in the area. An army spokesman confirmed the arrests and the declaration of martial law but declined to say whether all those arrested were members of the Tudeh Party (Communist Party) or to reveal the exact number of those arrested. The governor of Isfahan province in the south, Bakhtiar, was also among those arrested, indicating the seriousness of the situation in Iran.</p>
<p>Bakhtiar, leading his guards, resisted arrest for a week and finally surrendered on Thursday. Police arrested former army captain Rousbeh, who had fled to the Soviet Union after participating in the failed autonomous government of Azerbaijan, in Simrun, a suburb of Tehran, yesterday. It is rumored that the governor of Isfahan has connections with the Soviet Union. According to right-wing newspapers, the Communist Party had a plan to stage an uprising in Iran in early May, with participants being former members of the previous Azerbaijan autonomy movement and some new recruits. Some pro-Soviet figures disappeared after the failure of the Azerbaijan movement, having actually fled to the Soviet Union to prepare for a resurgence. It is said that the location for this uprising is the Gorgan Plain on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea in Mazandaran Province, and that Mazandaran, Isfahan, and some indigenous areas in southern and central Iran are strategic areas for the Communist coup. Tudeh Party members are particularly active in Isfahan Province, actively engaging in inciting the masses, while the Soviet Union is also utilizing the Basseri tribe of the Qashqai people. Many of these tribes have secretly entered Iran from the Soviet Union to plot an uprising. The newspaper summarized the Communist-directed "Plan 1327" (this year is 1227 in the Iranian calendar), saying that its steps involve intensifying propaganda, coupled with repeated Soviet protests to Iran as a form of coercion, while simultaneously sending more agents into Iran to incite the indigenous people to rebel against the government, and then staging uprisings simultaneously across the country on the predetermined date. The newspaper said that this information was revealed by people close to the government.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 10th] The new Siamese Prime Minister, Field Marshal Luang Phibunsongkhram, expressed concern at a press conference today about possible incidents between China and Siam. However, he said that the Siamese government is studying the immigration laws of other countries and other laws to resolve the issue of Chinese in Siam. Mr. Pibun also revealed that his new cabinet of twenty-five people is almost complete and hopes that all countries in the world will recognize his government. Regarding the organization of the new cabinet, retired foreign affairs elder Prince Phiriabhiban has agreed to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he expects the parliament to give the cabinet a vote of confidence. Speaking of Sino-Siamese relations, he said that one thing in the current situation that concerns him is the possibility of incidents occurring between China and Siam. He said that even a slight mistake by the government could trigger unrest, as the Chinese were once very unfavorable towards him. However, the Siamese government certainly does not intend to infringe on the rights of the Chinese in Siam. The government is now studying the laws of other countries regarding immigration and other matters to resolve the problem of Chinese in Siam.</p>

<p>(16) Defending Hengyang Greatly Frustrated the Japanese Invaders</p>
<p>In the war against Japan, the Americans responsible for military supplies to China used most of the supplies to reopen Burma, and by the time the situation in China became critical in 1944, their help was too little and too late.</p>
<p>One of the Japanese goals in 1944 was to open an inland transportation line from Manchuria through China to Southeast Asia, a goal that was eventually achieved. The record of Japanese success is also a record of American warnings unheeded and requests unfulfilled. In May, the situation in China had deteriorated to such an extent that without using the fuel flown over the Hump to supply the B-29s based near Chengdu for future operations—and without using the Superfortresses to strike at the Japanese offensive bases on the south bank of the Yangtze River, Hankou—there was simply no chance of stopping the Japanese offensive.</p>
<p>In accordance with the instructions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Theater Commander Stilwell had the authority to declare a state of emergency and to make emergency use of the 20th Bomber Group and other resources of the Theater Command. In mid-May, I telegraphed Stilwell that a state of emergency was imminent.</p>
<p>I suggested that he set a limit for declaring a state of emergency, so that there would be some time for planning beforehand. He replied to this with an insinuation, saying that this would make the Chinese completely dependent on us. He was not prepared to declare a state of emergency until the crisis became "absolutely certain." This telegram was sent on May 25, 1944, just one day before the Japanese launched their offensive from the south bank of the Yangtze River in Hunan Province. One day before the offensive.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to use the full strength of the 14th Air Force and the Sino-American Composite Wing to launch attacks, while reiterating warnings of impending disaster and reiterating requests for more supplies, so that these few aircraft could continue to fight. My warnings and requests did not produce concrete results. It was not until mid-June that the Theater Command had to admit that disaster was imminent. In the second half of April and the first half of May, Henan Province on the north bank of the Yangtze River had been breached by the Japanese, as a prelude to the offensive in Hunan Province on the south bank of the Yangtze River. On June 5, Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, was attacked by the Japanese and fell two weeks later. Changsha was where the previous, weaker Japanese offensive had been blocked. There was no way to stop the Japanese in Henan, but in Hunan it was different. In Hunan, we had strong air force units that could support the Chinese army. With just a small amount of weapons and supplies, the Chinese army could perform very well. This was especially true for Xue Yue's troops stationed from Changsha south to Hengyang. I believed that just increasing the air force's supplies by 2,000 tons per month in April and May could have reversed the situation on the south bank of the Yangtze River. This amount was only slightly more than the air supplies we lost due to the launch of the Nujiang-Burma operation.</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese troops used in the Hunan area were first transferred to the Yangtze River area, and then launched an offensive southward from the Hankou area. Hankou was their main base, and the Yangtze River was their supply line, both of which were easily vulnerable to air attacks. If 2,000 tons of fuel and ammunition could have been used for air attacks in April and May, the enemy's strength could have been weakened, its steps disrupted, and its morale dampened at the beginning of the offensive, which would have greatly benefited the poorly armed Chinese army.</p>
<p>The fact that Xue Yue's troops defended Hengyang for forty-seven days supports this belief. However, the Theater Command regarded Hengyang as already lost when the Japanese launched their first attack, and indeed viewed the battles in eastern China with careless defeatism.</p>
<p>When the Japanese artillery began targeting Changsha on June 5, Stilwell left Burma to personally pay attention to the situation in China. Stilwell had been staying in Burma for several months in order to open up the Burma Road. When he arrived in Kunming, he avoided holding a meeting with me and immediately flew to Chongqing to meet with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>In Chongqing, Stilwell finally agreed to increase the 14th Air Force's supplies to the level I had recommended. He told me of this decision during a brief stopover in Kunming on his way back to Burma. His stopover was so short that we were unable to consider the equally important issue of how to transport the supplies eastward along the dilapidated transportation lines to our air force bases.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency] Since Soochow University student Wang Zongyi admitted to being a pre-Party member of the Communist bandits and expressed his willingness to surrender himself to the authorities, based on leads, the city's security authorities continued to interrogate three Soochow University students, Wang Zongshu, Zheng Jingqu, and Yin Zhenmin, on the evening of the 10th. According to Wang Zongshu's confession, he is a member of the Communist Party, and Wang Zongyi is his younger brother, who was introduced to the Communist Party by him. Zheng and Yin are both key members of the Communist Party in the school and are highly suspected and have been taken to the police station for interrogation. In addition, Soochow University student Wang Zhijian read the newspaper on the morning of the 11th and learned that "the authorities have decided to be lenient and not hold people accountable for the past, and to provide them with security guarantees." He went to the North Station Police Station to surrender himself and has a confession stating: "Therefore, I have decided to repent and am willing to fundamentally break away from the past, seek a new beginning, and step up the suppression of bandits to complete the great task of nation-building."

<h3 id="e69">Dance Industry's Appeal Rejected, Full Text of the City Government's Decision, Appellant's Failure to Perform Duties is Irredeemable <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] In the case of the dance industry workers petitioning and vandalizing the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the dissolution of the Dance Hall Business Association, the Vocational Union, and the Professional Musicians Association in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the People's Organization Law during Extraordinary Times. The Dance Hall Business Association expressed disagreement with the Bureau of Social Affairs' decision and, through lawyer Chen Rui, filed an administrative appeal with the City Government. The City Government ruled that the reasons were insufficient and rejected the appeal. The decision has already been delivered to the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>"If the Dance Hall Business Association does not agree with this decision, it may file a further appeal with the Ministry of Social Affairs within 30 days from the day of delivery." The reasons for the ruling are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>"According to Article 18, Paragraph 1 of the People's Organization Law during Extraordinary Times, when a people's organization violates laws and regulations, endangers public interests, or neglects its duties, the competent authority may take the following actions: (1) Warning. (2) Revocation of registration. (3) Reorganization. (4) Dissolution. Therefore, what should be investigated in this case is whether the appellant has violated laws and regulations, endangered public interests, or neglected its duties. It has been found that the meeting minutes of the appellant association on January 24 of this year record that 25 dance hall representatives, including Sun Hongyuan, and 34 employee, dancer, and musician representatives were present. Chairman Sun Hongyuan reported that the extension of the lottery was difficult to approve. The issue of banning the dance lottery is very urgent, and it is requested that everyone discuss it together. It was decided that the third plenary session of all colleagues would be held at New Xianlin Dance Hall at 9:00 a.m. on January 31. Also, the meeting minutes of the appellant association on January 29 record that 21 dance hall representatives, including Sun Hongyuan, and 25 employee, dancer, employee, and musician representatives were present. Item 4 of the discussion items was a proposal to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs after the general meeting on the 31st. It was decided that everyone would go together, and dancers would be transported by truck. Item 7 was a proposal on whether to punish those who did not attend the general meeting and petition on the 31st. It was decided that all employees who did not attend would be suspended, and dancers who did not attend would be fined 2 million to 3 million yuan. Also, the eighth proposal of the third temporary emergency meeting of colleagues on January 31 was that all employees and dancers unanimously requested the congress to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs. It was decided that everyone would unanimously pass the motion. All of the above meeting situations and resolutions are supported by the records at the time and can be used as evidence. Looking at the above records in comparison with each other, it is sufficient to prove that the collective petition on January 31 was purely initiated by the appellant, which is very clear. The resolutions to prepare special vehicles to transport dancers to the Bureau of Social Affairs and to suspend or fine 2 million to 3 million yuan to those who do not go to the Bureau of Social Affairs are intended to intentionally use violence, coercion, and instigation to cause trouble, which cannot be denied. Article 2 of the Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order, promulgated by the National Government on May 18 of last year, states: All people's organizations or school students may send representatives to express their opinions, but the number of representatives is limited to ten people, and they may not use coercion by gathering crowds. Those who violate this will be dissolved in accordance with Article 149 of the law. This law should be known to the appellant. However, they have repeatedly made the aforementioned decisive battle, which is legally inappropriate. Moreover, according to the investigation, when the appellant instigated the petition to reach the original office, they did not follow the regulations to send representatives to the original office to express their opinions. They immediately carried out a riot, vandalized public property, and obstructed public affairs, which is even more illegal. Even if the initial purpose of the appellant's instigation of the petition was not to carry out a riot, instigating thousands upon thousands of people to collectively petition may allow any unfortunate incident to occur. Since the appellant's responsibility is to prevent this from happening, but they were unable to do so in advance. When the riot occurred, they were unable to provide effective dissuasion in time, which shows that the organization was loose, the leadership was lacking, and the failure to perform duties is irredeemable. Therefore, the appellant in this case violated laws and regulations by instigating a collective petition, and then failed to lead properly, causing a riot and affecting social security. The nature of the situation is obviously not comparable to ordinary incidents. Therefore, the original office dissolved the organization and sent personnel to reorganize it. Based on the above discussion and conclusion, the appeal in this case should be considered unreasonable. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the first section of Article 8 of the Administrative Appeal Law, the decision is made as stated in the main text."</p>

<h3 id="e73">Workers' Education Investigation Committee's Work in Progress; Believes China Textile's Various Facilities Are Worth Learning From <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Workers' Education Investigation Committee of the Teachers College of National Central University, led by the director, has recently launched a comprehensive investigation of the various factories in Shanghai affiliated with the China Textile Construction Company. On the morning of April 5th, the first discussion meeting of the investigators was held at the China Textile General Company. At that time, based on the scope of the investigation, it was decided to proceed in three groups: one group for the education of employees' children, one group for general training, and one group for technical training. Since the afternoon of April 5th, the various members and investigators have been following the scheduled agenda, departing collectively for visits every day while also conducting separate investigations in groups and implementing individual interviews. During the first week of investigation, until the afternoon of the 9th, they visited more than twenty units, including the technical training classes, research classes, workers' supplementary classes, children's primary schools, hospitals, and employee welfare facilities affiliated with the various China Textile factories. At each unit, a discussion meeting was first held with the responsible personnel to conduct a detailed review of the entire facility, and then an on-site visit and investigation was conducted, filling out detailed forms. Opinion surveys for students in specialized research classes, technical training classes, and training classes were filled out separately by the students due to their higher level of education. As for the individual worker survey form, the listed survey items, ranging from gender, place of origin, and age to family economic status, social life and psychological status, beliefs, hobbies, and aspirations, numbered as many as eighty-two items. The investigation method was for the investigators to record the answers based on the questions asked item by item. Each interview with a worker required at least one hour.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 9th, the Investigation Committee held its first work review meeting. In addition to reviewing the work of the past week, it was also decided to conduct rigorous investigations and facility unit investigations in groups starting this week. The investigation work is expected to be completed by April 20th. From April 21st to May 31st, the data will be sorted, compiled, and reports will be written, with Zhao Mian and Yi Qichang serving as the chief and deputy editors, respectively. At the first work review meeting, after careful study, Chairman Zhao officially announced to reporters that there were three points: (1) Technical Education: China Textile has a method of training apprentice workers for raw workers. For the cultivation of lower-level basic cadres, there are artisan training classes. For the cultivation of middle and lower-level technicians, there are technical training classes. For the advanced studies of on-the-job personnel, there are advanced study classes. For the improvement of factory technology, there are specialized technical research classes. These facilities demonstrate China Textile's emphasis on worker technical training classes. Moreover, its training spirit is quite conducive to the mutual coordination of technical training and actual production processes. The intention is very good and worth learning from. (2) General Education: Most factories have established worker supplementary classes, and their importance has been recognized by the responsible persons of each factory. However, workers are physically and mentally exhausted after working ten hours a day, and enrollment is not very enthusiastic, so the results are not significant. The way to improve is to pay attention to all aspects of teaching materials, teaching methods, teachers, and working hour systems at the same time. Movie, broadcasting, and other non-formal education facilities should also be fully utilized. (3) Employee Welfare: In employee welfare undertakings, medical facilities and employee children's schools are of considerable scale.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Paint Merchant Xi Rungeng Accused of Abandoning His Illegitimate Children; Legal Wife Missing, Life or Death Unknown; Request to Acknowledge Biological Children; Blood Type Test Does Not Conform to Genetic Statistical Formula <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xi Rungeng, the owner of the Grand Shanghai Hotel and Ruirun Paint Company, has recently been sued in court by a Ningbo woman, Hua Wangshi, for abandoning his illegitimate children. Mediation failed, and she requested a legal judgment. The object of the lawsuit is to request a judgment acknowledging Xi Baxin and Xi Xiaomei as the biological children of the defendant Xi Rungeng and the plaintiff. The defendant should acknowledge Baxin and Xiaomei as his biological children, and the defendant should bear the litigation costs.</p>
<p>The facts and reasons stated in the complaint are as follows: In June 1930, the defendant in this case used various methods and means to establish a marital relationship with the plaintiff. In the spring of the following year, the defendant rented a room on the front floor of No. 32, Shoufu Lane in this city as a place for secret rendezvous and cohabitation. In September 1932, she became pregnant. At that time, the plaintiff's husband, Hua Xianping, was working in Jinhua. On the 13th day of the fifth lunar month of 1933, she gave birth to a son. Because the defendant loved the drama "Farewell My Concubine," he named him "Baxin." Later, they moved to No. 35 in the same lane, and their relationship deepened. In September 1936, she became pregnant again. At that time, the plaintiff's husband was working in Haimen. On the 19th day of the sixth lunar month of 1937, she gave birth to a daughter, who was also named "Xiaomei" by the defendant.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Asked the Defendant About Her Husband</p>
<p>At that time, the war situation was becoming increasingly urgent. The plaintiff's husband resigned from his job in Haimen and returned home. Fortunately, both matters were cleverly concealed. The defendant and the plaintiff's husband were originally friends, but it was always inconvenient for him to live in the house. The defendant strongly urged Xianping to go to Shantou to take over the business of the Hongmao Soap Factory on his behalf. The plaintiff and Xianping did not know it was a trap and resolutely went on the trip. The defendant sent people with the surname Fang to follow. Unexpectedly, he never returned. The plaintiff became suspicious and repeatedly asked about him. Later, she heard the defendant say vaguely, "I'm afraid he's already dead in Hong Kong." The plaintiff was a weak woman with no way out. After Xianping left home, the defendant openly came and went to the plaintiff's house, and ordered Baxin to call him father. The defendant also supplied all living expenses.</p>
<p>Same Voice and Appearance</p>
<p>At that time, the defendant's wife had died, and he asked the plaintiff to move into his house to formalize their relationship. The plaintiff became even more suspicious, deeply suspecting that Xianping had been harmed by the defendant's premeditation. The defendant, seeing that the plaintiff's questioning was becoming increasingly urgent, stopped coming in 1941 and abandoned his children. Later, he colluded with the old patrol room to fabricate threatening letters in an attempt to frame the plaintiff and silence her. The lawsuit has been going on for six years without any results. The plaintiff's husband has not returned home to this day. She had previously filed a lawsuit for confirmation, which was rejected for "lack of standing." According to the case, the parties with a clear stake are the biological children of the defendant and the plaintiff. Their voices and appearances are exactly the same. How can the defendant abandon them? In addition to filing a separate lawsuit regarding the unknown whereabouts of the plaintiff's husband, she specially states the above true facts and requests a legal judgment.</p>
<p>Denial During the Hearing</p>
<p>However, the conclusion obtained from the blood type test conducted by the Institute of Forensic Medicine was that Xi Rungeng and Hua Wangshi were both blood type O, while Baxin and Xiaomei were both blood type A. According to the statistical formula of blood type inheritance, the blood type A of Baxin and Xiaomei should not have been produced by the combination of two blood type O's.</p>
<p>The court previously held a hearing once. The plaintiff Hua Wangshi testified that Xi abandoned her and had a conspiracy to harm her husband. Xi testified that he was being falsely accused and firmly denied that he had a romantic relationship with Hua Wangshi.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yan Peiyu, the protagonist of the "Mystery of the Madman" case, once again hosted reporters at the Wuxi Fellow Association at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yan's spirit was better than at the previous press conference. He spoke clearly and logically when he stood up to report. He first retold the past entanglements with his wife and the experience of being sent to a mental hospital. He also presented two new pieces of evidence in his report: first, when going to the hospital, they rode in two cars, one was a business car from Xiang Sheng Company, and the other was a private business car, the last three digits of the license plate number were "616." Second, someone in Puji Hospital clearly said to him: The reason he was sent to the hospital was because someone instigated it. Regarding the situation of filing a lawsuit after being discharged from the hospital, he said that he has requested the police bureau to investigate thoroughly. The police bureau has summoned him for questioning seven times. Chief Sun of the Criminal Division once advised him to reconcile, but he felt that his wife's methods were vicious. Even during the confrontation at the police bureau recently, she still said that he had mental illness, that he could not handle the factory affairs, and that it was originally very good to invite Hou Jiyuan to be the manager of the factory. He felt that his wife had no conscience at all, so he was unwilling to reconcile casually. If they want to reconcile, the first thing to do is to recover the lost items. However, when both parties, along with lawyers and police bureau personnel, went to the factories to take over the goods the other day, the inventory showed that thirty to forty boxes of metal parts were missing. Later, after Yan locked the factory doors, his wife sent someone to cut off the chains. The workers Yan sent to guard the factory were driven away, and the notices he posted were torn down. Yesterday, Hou Jiyuan sent someone with the surname Song, named Zhao Jinwei, to visit the Daxi Road branch factory, so the civil part has not yet been resolved, and the criminal part requests the police bureau to step up the investigation. Finally, Yan said again: "Please take a look, I really don't have any mental illness!"</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM this morning, the local court will hold a hearing in Court No. 11 to summon Yan Peiyu for questioning in order to decide on the issue of prohibiting the management of property applied for by his wife Yuan Baoying.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] After the victory, several film companies held many temporary actor examinations. The many applicants, who were crowded together, said in unison that they had a special love for film art. Later, after careful research by the companies, they found that the so-called "love for film art" was completely a euphemism. In fact, they just wanted to be "stars" and enjoy the silent envy of thousands of audiences for them. However, these ambitious people were unfortunately disappointed. In the past two or three years, it has been difficult to see a few unfamiliar faces on the screen. Even if a few "guest stars" appear, such as Xie Jiahua, Yuan Xuefen, Yi Xueyan, Hua Xianglin, etc., it is because they have titles such as "Miss" and "Queen," or even because the filming is "self-funded." Currently, most of the distribution income of film companies depends on Southeast Asia. To date, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are enthusiastically fascinated by the voices and smiles of a few old movie stars, and at the same time, they are also longing for the manners and movements of the domestically renowned "socialites." Their leap to the screen is of course a timely event. If a newcomer relies solely on a little acting skill, trying to show courtesy to the Southeast Asian audience on the screen, the result will definitely not be too ideal. Now the cost of a film is at least tens of billions or more. Film companies cannot make such a risky investment for the promotion of a few newcomers.</p>

<p>In fact, even if you really become a "star," life may not be as rich and comfortable as most people imagine. The film industry currently has no one to provide loans. The Shanghai foreign-owned cinemas are unwilling to regularly show domestic films. Although domestic films sell very well in many small cities outside of Shanghai, the ticket prices are extremely low. Selling films produced at high prices to rural and urban areas with low prices, the total income is of course limited. Now, except for a few glittering red stars, the lives of the entire film industry staff are very poor. The base salary is still stagnant below 65 yuan. The suffering of the times imposed on the shoulders of the film industry is no different from what we have experienced. Employees cannot study and improve. It is naturally even more difficult for film art to reach international standards. There are also recent</p>
<p>Impact on Psychological Restraints</p>
<p>In recent years, the storms caused by domestic films in society have also dealt a lot of blows to the film industry. The air force in "Su Fengji," the doctor in "A Spring River Flows East," the barber in "Fake Phoenixes," and the driver in "Where is the Jade Beauty" have all caused great resentment in these occupational classes. The formation of this resentment, on the one hand, affects the psychological constraints of the screenwriters. On the other hand, it makes the people who manage film censorship unwilling to let go of any film easily. For example, they require domestic films to have a sense of cause and effect. Bad people must immediately be tried in court and spend their years in prison, unlike American films. After a murderer commits a crime, he disappears without a trace, and as a result, he is murdered by his mistress years later, or is killed in a drunken fight. Since bad people do evil, they should no longer have wealth or love affairs, and they should only eat fists and be struck by the wind even when fighting. They also require domestic films to not insult all occupations and religions. People who begin to betray religion and eventually convert to religion, or those who are sheltered by religion and do evil, like in the American films "The Gunfighter" and "How Green Was My Valley," cannot appear.</p>
<p>Simple Equipment is Difficult to Improve</p>
<p>It is still possible to write all the characters as harmonious and kind, and to write all the things as satisfactory, but the low quality of photographic equipment is really impossible to improve. Replenishment requires money, and purchasing from abroad requires foreign exchange. Now the lighting equipment of each company is simple, the film is too slow to sense light, and the facial makeup of the crew is often fully revealed, making the audience look no different from Peking opera. Hollywood old stars Claudette Colbert, Ann Sheridan, and others are still in their youthful years in the lens, deceiving the audience and fascinating the audience for decades. This is absolutely dare not to be expected in domestic films. According to people in the film industry, even if Huang Zongzhan returns to Shanghai and intends to show his skills in his motherland, but in front of this pile of "cameras," he will definitely have a feeling of being unable to use his skills.</p>
<p>These are enough to explain why even the lowest-grade and most boring Western films can sell well in the country.</p>

<p>Xuan Tiewu Expresses His General Resignation as Commander</p>
<p>Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday: He has resigned twice to the central government from concurrently serving as the Shanghai Air Defense Commander, and it is still under consideration. He believes that it is more appropriate for the current Air Force general to take up this position. He served as the Air Defense Commander of Zhejiang Province during the Anti-Japanese War, and he knows the burden of this position. Now the affairs of the garrison commander are already extremely busy, so he is afraid that it will be difficult to take care of both. He talked about air defense, saying that air defense is not because there is war, but a necessary equipment for modern national defense, which can be regarded as a type of national defense business. However, active air defense should be more important than passive defense. Active air defense is to enrich the strength of the air force. As for the Shanghai Air Defense Command, it is being organized, and the address has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>Children Sitting in Cars and Living in Foreign-Style Houses: "Mayor Cai" Neither Envies Nor Hates Them</p>
<p>In response to the United Nations Children's Relief Fund's fundraising campaign, the Caohejing Municipal Refugee Children's Education Center specially held a grand parade yesterday. According to the team leader, Zhang Jingyan, 430 refugee children participated in the parade. In the morning, they took a bus to the Social Bureau, and from there, they proceeded to the Great World, turned to Nanjing Road and the Bund, and then took a short rest in the Bund Garden. The reporter, introduced by the team leader Zhang Jingyan, interviewed Cai Zhongde, the "Mayor of Shanghai" of the suffering children. An excerpt of the conversation is as follows: Asked, "Mayor Cai, what are your thoughts on the children begging on the streets?" He replied, "Yes, I dare to represent all the citizens of Shanghai (referring to the refugee children) and say that we really want to help the children who are begging, but we don't have the strength because we are still being helped by others." Asked, "Mayor, are you envious when you see children sitting in cars, living in foreign-style houses, and wearing beautiful clothes?" He replied, "I neither envy nor hate them, but it is indeed wrong for such a thing (referring to rich and poor children) to exist in a country. They are all children, so why do some enjoy too much and some enjoy too little?" The conversation ended, and when the team was returning, Mayor Cai led the team, followed by a decorated car with three-dimensional figures representing the contrasting lives of poor and rich children, including a boy with "tattered clothes and a dirty face" and a girl with clear eyes and delicate features, standing there, giving a deeper performance.</p>

<h3 id="e88">General Commodity Prices: Monetary Conditions Transition to a Period of Relaxation, Price Increase Trend Is Stirred Up Again <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In the previous issue, this publication pointed out that according to the inevitable law of alternating price increases and decreases and alternating monetary tightening and loosening in the late stage of inflation, monetary conditions entered a period of relaxation again last week. The actual performance was not far from the theoretical prediction. The relaxation of monetary conditions last week was an unprecedented phenomenon in a month. Continuing the loose trend of the previous weekend, it was still exceptionally loose and excessive. The black market interest rate dropped by another 0.1 from the previous weekend, amounting to 0.26, and the banks generally had more funds than they needed, even suffering from the difficulty of lending out money. The impact of such loose monetary conditions on commodity prices is self-evident. However, there were three relatively special factors in the resurgence of commodity price increases last week, which were not present in the previous few weeks. The impact of these factors is not limited to last week but will continue to have a profound impact in the coming week, which is worth noting. Many merchants in the market even psychologically believe that the second major price fluctuation of this year will start from last week. Although this is the merchants' view and has no theoretical basis, it is not difficult to imagine the impact on commodity prices if the majority of merchants in the market are bullish on prices. In addition to the loose monetary conditions, the other three special factors for the rebound in commodity prices last week are:</p>
<p>First, the order to suspend deferred settlement transactions of securities was issued by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Finance and Economics on the previous Saturday. The resident securities exchange supervision office of the Ministry of Finance and Economics received the order on the previous Sunday and immediately notified the securities exchange authorities, which complied. Although this measure is justified in cracking down on speculative transactions from the government's perspective, it has a significant impact on commodity prices from the perspective of its relationship to commodity prices. On the one hand, the arbitrage funds in each deferred settlement have now reached more than 1 trillion. After the suspension of deferred settlement activities, will these funds not become floating capital in society again? On the other hand, the deferred settlement margin and additional margin deposited in the National Bank are also very large. After the cancellation of deferred settlement, this amount of funds will flow out of the National Bank, will the source of floating capital in society not increase again? At least some of these floating funds will enter the path of absorbing materials. Second, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee raised various foreign exchange rates by about 25% again last Tuesday. The benchmark price of US dollars rose to 324,000 yuan, an increase of 69,000 yuan; the British pound rose to 972,000 yuan, an increase of 207,000 yuan; the Hong Kong dollar and Indian rupee also increased. The impact is of course obvious. The stock market immediately rebounded that day, with as many as 13 spot stocks reaching the limit up. Foreign stocks also tended to be strong, with Jardine Matheson surging past the 5 million mark. The cotton cloth market was also affected, and the market sentiment was revived. Spot stocks reappeared across the board on Wednesday, and foreign stocks rose by 20%. The cotton cloth market's upward trend intensified. These are all immediate effects of the foreign exchange increase, but its impact is not limited to last week. In addition, the impact on the black market for gold and banknotes is self-evident. The telegraphic transfer rate for Hong Kong dollars shrank to 8.5 cents per 100,000 legal currency on Thursday, which is a record high. Of course, this is also inevitably affected by the increase in the foreign exchange benchmark rate. Third, the prices of four public utilities in the city, including telephone, electricity, and tap water, increased uniformly last Friday, all by 60% to 70%, which is the highest percentage increase in previous times. The impact of this increase is of course also not limited to last week.</p>
<p>Under the influence of the above factors, commodity prices rose quite a lot last week, especially in the second half of the week (but please note that the various commodity price indices compiled by this association are limited to the materials from Monday to Thursday, which is entirely due to publication time constraints). In particular, building materials, cotton textiles, and food rose more sharply. The cotton cloth market reached new highs last Thursday. 42-count Blue Phoenix reached 240 million per piece, 21-count Double Horse reached 160 million, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth exceeded the 5 million mark. These are all new records that have never been seen before. Although there was a slight decline at the weekend, various cotton textiles were still more than 10% higher than the previous weekend. Silk fabrics rose less. The food market was affected by the increase in the city government's rationed food prices, and because of rumors at the beginning of last week that the People's Food Allocation Committee was considering purchasing food rice due to the sluggish food market, although the committee denied it, the market had already been affected. Superior white japonica rice reached a high price of 4 million per picul again last Friday, and extra-high japonica rice once reached a maximum of 4.15 million. Military vessel wheat flour also approached the peak of 1.5 million per bag again, and other edible oils and miscellaneous grains also rose at the same time. The rise in wood and bricks among building materials was even faster. Chemicals, metals, etc., were relatively stable, such as 693 vulcanized metal, which only increased by 2 million from 50 million per barrel at the end of the previous weekend to the end of last week. But what is worrying is that the impact of foreign exchange adjustments and public utility price increases will continue to appear in the next few weeks, and if the government has no new outlets to divert the funds absorbed by deferred settlements after the suspension of deferred settlements, there will be another source of floating capital in the market. Perhaps the monetary authorities already have a plan in mind.</p>
<p>In addition, there are various rumors in the market, such as the foreign exchange market will be reopened, import and export trade will be allowed to implement a partial linked system, and the foreign exchange benchmark rate will be adjusted again, all of which stimulate price increases. How to quell these rumors is naturally also a major goal of stabilizing commodity prices.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Currency and Finance: Excess Liquidity and Loose Monetary Conditions, Ample Funds and Lower Black Market Interest Rates <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the city's monetary conditions were fully relaxed to the point of being excessive. Since the weekend before last, the National Bank continued to issue large amounts of new currency to cope with the exchange of short-term treasury bills and other payments, so the market was flooded with funds. Last week, the Executive Yuan ordered the suspension of deferred settlement transactions of Chinese stocks on Monday and set a deadline of seven days for final settlement. Although it was said that banks could subsequently hold weekly savings trust deposits with interest equal to interbank deposits of the National Bank to absorb the funds withdrawn from the arbitrage market due to the suspension of deferred settlement, because the interest on such trust deposits was not as high as the arbitrage interest, a portion of the funds, which may be quite large, may have become floating capital. The increasingly loose monetary conditions in the city after the second half of last week may be related to this. In addition, the continuous outflow of funds from national banks and the influx of floating capital from other places were also the main reasons for the overall loosening of monetary conditions last week.</p>
<p>Within five days from Monday to Friday last week, the exchange balance of national banks, except for a real net inflow of 34.9 billion on Thursday, was consistently a net outflow for the other days. After deducting the interbank time deposits of the National Bank, the actual net outflow of national banks reached more than 670 billion in four days.</p>
<p>On the commercial bank side, the general trend was long last week, and funds accumulated abnormally. Interbank lending was almost at a standstill. From Monday to Friday, the exchange results of banks after No. 60 showed a net outflow of 733.3 billion. Among them, the net inflow on Wednesday alone was 37.2 billion, which can also measure the abundance of bank reserves.</p>
<p>The exchange results of foreign banks last week showed a net inflow of 598.2 billion from Monday to Friday, including a net outflow of 19.1 billion on Wednesday. The net outflow of foreign banks is not common, and it is said to be related to the inflow of northern capital.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon of loose monetary conditions was the continued decline in black market interest rates. The black market interest rate in the first half of last week was generally between 0.27 and 0.24, and in the second half of the week, it was as low as 0.225 and 0.21, falling within the overdue interest parity of the banking industry. As for the interest on security firms' back-to-back transactions of white yarn, it was generally around 0.245 before Wednesday, but it rose to around 0.4 on Thursday, which was probably affected by the optimistic sentiment in the stock market.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the domestic exchange rates of commercial banks in the city rose last week. The discount for Tianjin exchange was 50 yuan at the beginning of the week, and it rose to 30 yuan from Wednesday to Friday. The discount for Hankou exchange also continued to rise from 30 yuan on Monday to 100 yuan on Friday. The discount for Chongqing exchange also increased from 20 yuan to 30 yuan from Thursday to Friday. The discount for Xiamen exchange was 130 yuan at the beginning of the week, and it rose to 200 yuan on Friday. The discount for Guangzhou exchange generally hovered around 170 to 180 yuan throughout the week. The increase in exchange rates in various places shows the increasing outflow of funds from the city. The reason why Guangzhou exchange was relatively flat may be due to the impact of short-term treasury bills replacing exchange funds flowing south.</p>
<p>The benchmark rate for foreign exchange in the city was raised again on Tuesday, with the US dollar at 324,000 yuan per dollar, an increase of 27%. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar remained unchanged, equivalent to 972,000 yuan per British pound. The exchange rate for Hong Kong telegraphic transfers continued to tighten, and it entered the 1 yuan mark by Wednesday. It shrank again on Thursday, with 100,000 legal currency only worth 8.5 cents in Hong Kong dollars, which is related to the increase in the benchmark rate. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was around 5.723 Hong Kong dollars. The continuous decline in the Hong Kong exchange rate shows that capital flight is still severe.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese stock market rose sharply and retreated quickly, and the volatility was quite drastic. On Monday, an order was issued to suspend deferred settlement transactions of Chinese stocks, stipulating that all new deferred settlement transactions would be suspended from April 5, and that any concluded transactions could only be completed within seven days. This was tantamount to blowing a storm in the stock market, causing the current 18 stocks to fall to the limit. The current month of Yongsha fell into the 1,400 mark. However, on Tuesday, stimulated by the favorable buy of the higher foreign exchange rate, major investors aggressively bought at low prices, and 14 current stocks recovered to the limit up, with ups and downs reaching almost 30%. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank to the 1 yuan mark, and monetary conditions were relaxed. The current 21 Chinese stocks reached the limit up. In the morning session on Thursday, Yongsha even knocked on the 2,000 yuan mark, but it rebounded slightly as major investors sold to cash in their profits. On Friday, loose monetary conditions remained, and the stock market rose by 10% as a result of the sudden 70% increase in public utility prices. If the closing price of Chinese stocks on Friday is compared with the holding price on Monday, Yongsha increased by 40%, Jinglun increased by 33%, and the increase rate of China Silk was more than 50%. The severity of this price increase was quite rare, and the strength of floating capital in the city can also be seen in general.</p>
<p>The fluctuations in foreign stocks were relatively small last week. The increase in foreign exchange rates, the overflow of monetary conditions, the shrinking of Hong Kong exchange rates, and the intended increase in public utility prices all provided incentives for favorable buying, so the market generally increased except for slight setbacks on Monday and Thursday. Compared with the afternoon buying price on Friday and Monday, Yisha increased by 37%, Jardine Matheson increased by about 30%, British American Tobacco increased by 26%, and Jardine Matheson increased by 25%. Generally speaking, the fluctuations were not as drastic as those of Chinese stocks.</p>

<p>The Problem of Freezing the Cost of Living Index</p>
<p>In the past week, due to the dispute over the monthly increase in the cost of living index, the opposing relationship between labor and management seems to have become more apparent. However, manufacturers are very clear in their hearts: First, the organized power of the working class makes it difficult to have a direct conflict with them. Second, in terms of the purchasing power of money, the cost of living index is only half of the general commodity price index. In the process of constantly rising commodity prices and constantly falling purchasing power of money, openly freezing the cost of living index is not only unbearable for the working class itself, which will incite a series of resistance such as strikes and work stoppages, but also unjust and not approved by social opinion in general. Therefore, the manufacturers' spearhead has to turn to the current government authorities, demanding that the government increase in-kind rations for workers to freeze the cost of living index in disguise.</p>
<p>However, due to the heavy burden of war expenses, the government has reduced the living standards of public servants to the lowest level. However, in today's situation where the cost of living index for public servants must be unfrozen, adding a not-so-small amount of in-kind rations for workers is indeed a very difficult problem to deal with. Although the problem is unexpectedly difficult, the government authorities must take steps to deal with this problem. Therefore, the Social Bureau has stated that all rations in factories must be handled through cooperatives in the future, and that once cooperatives are generally established in major factories throughout the city, the workers' rations will be expanded. At that time, the cost of living index will be calculated based on the price of rations. As the head of the cooperative section of the bureau explained, the active promotion of cooperative work throughout the city aims to reduce exploitation and profit-seeking by middlemen, and to achieve the practical effect of stabilizing commodity prices to achieve the goal of freezing the cost of living index in disguise.</p>
<p>According to another report, the plan prepared by the Social Bureau for providing rations to workers in general is as follows: (1) Raw material factories should supply finished product factories with rations at cost price; (2) For direct manufacturing factories, the government should provide part of the material rations to reduce manufacturing costs; (3) National banks should provide loans to finished product factories, and each factory should engage in large-scale production; (4) The ration method will still be handled in a cooperative manner in the future.</p>
<p>The first item in the above proposed plan is obviously unfavorable to raw material factories. Therefore, if there are other remedies, the situation of such factories will become more difficult. Items 2 and 3 are a disguised form of restoring industrial loans. After the restoration of industrial loans, assuming that other conditions remain unchanged, whether production can increase as scheduled to achieve the goal of stabilizing commodity prices remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<p>If the production volume does not increase as scheduled due to the supply of various favorable conditions, and if commodity prices fail to stabilize due to the continued deterioration of other factors (such as continued inflation) after the production volume increases, then the so-called cooperative handling of rations is nothing more than a disguised form of hoarding in advance. In this way, the stimulation of general commodity prices may be more drastic, and all adverse effects may not be deepened and widespread!</p>
<p>"Cheap Grain Harms Farmers" and "Expensive Grain Harms the People"?</p>
<p>Just when the majority of citizens were congratulating each other on the daily decline in the price of food rice, the listed prices in rice shops were rising daily. At the beginning of last week, people in the city's miscellaneous grain industry expressed their hope that the rice allocation authorities would pay attention to two things: (1) the storage problem of food rice. It is said that some of the food rice in the rice warehouses has become moldy, and the Huo Festival is approaching, which deserves special attention; (2) the price of rice in the rice-producing areas is higher than that in the city, which may cause the phenomenon of reverse flow of rice in the city. As for the government authorities, from a different perspective, they also expressed infinite worries about the daily decline in rice prices and sluggish sales! At the same time, for precautionary reasons, the People's Allocation Committee will plan to purchase rice arriving at the port (see the conversation of the head of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau). The planned method is that if any rice merchants have inventory that cannot be sold, the People's Allocation Committee will purchase it at the market transaction price, paying 80% of the price first, and the remaining 20% after delivery. At the same time, it is said that in order to stabilize rice prices in the city, the People's Allocation Committee specially transferred 90,000 dan of food rice purchased from Wuhu, Hankou and other places to the Nanjing Municipal Government. The head of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau believes that the measures taken by the People's Allocation Committee to purchase rice arriving at the port will not stimulate rice price increases, because it is said that in addition to providing grain according to the number of people every month, the People's Allocation Committee can also prepare to meet market needs at any time. Once rice prices rise, the People's Allocation Committee can sell the purchased food rice without restriction to regulate supply and demand. But the fact is exactly the opposite of what a certain section chief understands. The newspaper reported on the 8th that "the trend of rising food rice prices has expanded, because the People's Food Allocation Committee wants to set the market to collect rice, which has caused the rice market, which has just stabilized, to rise again and rekindle." The People's Allocation Committee, of course, cannot bear the responsibility for "expanding the trend of rising food rice prices." Therefore, the denial of the purchase of food rice reappeared in the newspaper on the 9th. At the same time, the reasons for the 15% increase in rice prices in the past three days were attributed to the high transportation costs and the stimulation of the increase in foreign exchange rates. However, in all fairness, the so-called no wind, no waves, the 15% increase in rice prices in the past three days is indeed related to the increase in foreign exchange rates, but it is also "coincidentally" related to the concerns of the relevant authorities about the daily decline in rice prices and the disclosure of the People's Allocation Committee's purchase plan and the transfer of 90,000 dan of food rice to the Beijing Municipal Government. The subtle relationship in between is self-evident to discerning people. "The purchase of food rice arriving at the port cannot stimulate rice price increases," so purchase it opportunistically in the "rice market that has just stabilized." If the rice market "rises again and rekindles" as a result, then "once rice prices rise, the People's Allocation Committee can sell the purchased food rice without restriction to regulate supply and demand." Buying in at low prices and selling at high prices, there is profit between one in and one out, and there is a theoretical basis for both. The theoretical basis for purchase is "cheap grain harms farmers," and the theoretical basis for sale is "expensive grain harms the people." But whether this theoretical basis can be established, it seems that the government authorities still need to consider it carefully.</p>

<p>Ginseng 35,009 taels</p>
<p>Caustic Soda 466 piculs</p>
<p>Quantity of Chinese Exports to Japan</p>
<p>Salt 636,935 piculs</p>
<p>Refined Salt 100,000 piculs</p>
<p>Soybeans 29,000 piculs</p>
<p>Tung Oil 8,076 piculs</p>
<p>Soybean Cake 7,500 piculs</p>
<p>Sugar 1,129 piculs</p>
<p>All of the above barter transactions are managed by the Barter Division of the Central Trust Bureau. This year's barter materials to Japan will still be mainly salt, especially Weilu salt. It has now been decided to export 600,000 dan to Japan. Taiwan also has more than 20,000 tons of surplus salt waiting to be loaded onto ships. Last week, another 18,000 tons of soybeans from Northeast China were transported from Tianjin. Hankou transported 14,000 tons of soybean cake, peanuts and other miscellaneous grains. The first batch of 71,000 bags of Taiwan sugar, weighing 7,000 tons, also arrived in Japan the day before yesterday, which is the first batch of Taiwan sugar transported to Japan according to the contract. In addition, the export of 200,000 tons of ore sand from Hainan Island to Japan once made the Japanese rejoice. Recently, three Japanese engineers arrived in Hainan Island to survey. In addition to exchanging rayon and other materials, it is also planned to exchange for 120,000 spindles, because the Japanese cotton textile industry has great potential. Japan can currently manufacture 30,000 to 40,000 spindles per month, while China can only manufacture the same number in one year, and China still lacks a large-scale spindle manufacturing plant. Japan's production target for the cotton textile industry this year is 955,510,700 yards of cotton cloth, which will be dumped in large quantities in various parts of the Far East, including not only Nanyang and Korea, but also China itself. Looking at the situation of barter trade between China and Japan over the years, it still does not deviate from the scope of "industrial Japan and agricultural China." Looking to the future, it is truly alarming!</p>

<p>Self-Paying Students at Central University Demand Food Subsidies; Over a Hundred Students Fasted for a Day Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Several hundred self-paying students at Central University fasted for one day on the 11th to demand public funding. The university only approved one subsidized position for every six guaranteed students applying to the Ministry of Education. The students hoped to receive a subsidy of one million yuan per month for all meals, but the university did not agree.</p>
<p>A Repository of Knowledge about the "Sea": Maritime Academic Data Center in Xiamen</p>
<p>Our country's coastline stretches over 8,600 kilometers, from the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to the mouth of the Beilun River in the south. The "sea" is too closely connected to the lives of Chinese people, yet Chinese people's understanding of the "sea" is insufficient. May I ask how many institutions in China, which should be considered a maritime nation, are dedicated to studying the "sea"? We pay so little attention to the "sea."</p>
<p>Xiamen is a major port for overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country, and most of the people here rely on the sea for a living. They are thirsty for knowledge about the sea. In response to this need, a research institution dedicated to collecting data about the sea was established – the Maritime Academic Data Center. It was established just over a year ago, and its location is on the beautiful island of Gulangyu, in what was originally a villa owned by an overseas Chinese. It is surrounded by the sea on three sides, the buildings are high and airy, the scenery is beautiful, and the waves are vast. It is truly a scenic maritime location, and there could be no better place to study and conduct research!</p>
<p>Inside the data center, there are two departments: data and research. The data department has three sections: books, clippings, and cultural relics. Currently, there are over ten thousand reference books, over a hundred cultural relics, two hundred thousand clippings, and over ten thousand photographs. The most interesting are the clippings, which are collected from over two hundred newspapers, classified and pasted. The era covered extends back to the late Qing Dynasty, and the region covered spans Southeast Asia. Those shelves upon shelves of clippings are practically a living encyclopedia, and have become good friends to journalists, university students, professors, and experts here.</p>
<p>The research department is currently engaged in investigation, research, collation, and translation work. The books they have compiled include "Indonesian National Movement," and several others have been completed and are awaiting funding for publication. The goals of the center's activities are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Research on coastal provinces and cities, especially Fujian, Guangdong, Taiwan, and Hainan, in terms of history and geography.</p>
<p>(2) Research on national defense, economy, and culture in coastal areas.</p>
<p>(3) Research on various maritime industries.</p>
<p>(4) Research on overseas Chinese issues.</p>
<p>(5) Research on Southeast Asian issues and Pacific issues. The collection and research of data are based on the above five items, and relevant reference materials are also considered as much as possible.</p>
<p>This kind of work should have been done on a large scale by the government, but it seems that not many people are paying attention to it today. The center is just a few poor scholars burying themselves in their work, and they have managed to establish a certain scale in just over a year. It can be said to be a rising star in the academic world, and the reporter sincerely wishes it to shine even brighter.</p>
<p>Principal Liu of Northeastern University to Go to Beijing Soon</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Liu Shu, the principal of Northeastern University, is scheduled to go to Beijing soon to report the difficulties to the Ministry of Education.

<p>Mistakenly Conscripting Soldiers Sparks Student Unrest; Northwest Institute of Technology Incident; Hu Zongnan Has Handled It</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 11th] National Northwest University began a three-day strike yesterday in support of the "4/7 Student Unrest" at Northwest Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, Airmail Dispatch, 9th] Two students from the National Northwest Institute of Technology in Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, were forcibly conscripted by a recruitment company of the 167th Brigade passing through Xianyang Station on April 7, who mistook them for conscripted soldiers. The students immediately sent people to negotiate, which led to further conflicts. All students at the institute have now gone on strike to protest, and have elected representatives to come to Xi'an to petition the authorities and hold a press conference to report the truth.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 11th] The "4/7 Student Unrest" occurred at the National Northwest Institute of Technology in Xianyang. The two injured students, Yao and Xu, have been transferred to the Northwest University Hospital in Xi'an for treatment and are expected to recover. Director Hu Zongnan of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters quickly handled the matter, sending representatives and Chief of Staff Sheng Wen to express condolences and concern. The perpetrator, Shen, has been detained by his direct commander and will be handed over to the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters for court-martial. The student unrest is expected to be resolved quickly, and classes will resume soon.</p>
<p>Peaceful City Residents March in Protest Against Striking Students</p>

<p>Scientific High Altitude Exploration by Liu Dade</p>
<p>The stratospheric explorer, Jean Piccard, currently a professor of aeronautics at the University of Minnesota in the United States, is currently planning a nineteen-mile high-altitude trip. He has encountered countless difficulties and setbacks, such as those related to air, the press, university administrators, or purely scientific matters, but he has been able to overcome them one by one. This frail chemical engineer strives to raise his balloon, just to further explore cosmic rays. He now has a great desire to get a group of seventy-five Plaslics balloons up to the height where cosmic rays can really be studied.</p>
<p>The First Ascension – A Joke for Information</p>
<p>Piccard had originally planned another stratospheric trip last summer, planning to ascend to high altitude on a group of no less than seventy-five plastic balloons, each sixty-five feet in diameter, but this plan was delayed until this year.</p>
<p>In the past, many people regarded him as a strange person, and newspapers often treated him and his balloons as jokes, thinking that it was simply a stupid and ridiculous act to take the risk of high-altitude flight by balloon. But Piccard ignored these things, and although he may be the last person still doing this "ridiculous work," he still insisted on continuing.</p>
<p>His first ascension was held in October 1934 in Dearborn, Michigan. The balloon and gondola were designed and manufactured by him and his twin brother Auguste. The cost of manufacturing – $5,000 – was raised by friends and businessmen, and a bonus was obtained from the Chicago World's Fair of Progress. His companion on this voyage was his wife, Jeannette Ridlon. At 6:58 in the morning, 5,000 people were waiting for their first ascent into the sky, including the enthusiastic automobile tycoon Henry Ford, who stayed up all night to watch him.</p>
<p>This voyage rose to 57,579 feet (approximately eleven miles), crossed Lake Erie, and eight hours later, they landed on a wooded hillside near Codiz, Ohio. Just before landing, they calmly put on their football helmets. Soon after, a bold man ran into the woods and found them lying among the deflated balloons. Piccard's ankle was also broken. But they didn't take it seriously, but rejoiced for some things: (1) The lucky turtle, named Fieurde-lis, was still alive and well. (2) All instruments were undamaged. (3) A bag of letters reserved for philatelists was still intact.</p>
<p>The Second Ascension – Scientific Research</p>
<p>In July 1937, in order to test the theory that a cluster of balloons was more suitable for stratospheric flight than a single large balloon, Piccard sat in a bathtub-like gondola, which was tied to eighty white rubber balloons, and ascended into the sky in Rochester, Minnseota. Although his wife did not accompany him this time, she kept in touch with her husband via shortwave radio, and the content of these words was almost entirely to advise him not to fly too high. Six hours later, 110 miles from the starting point, Piccard, in order to avoid falling into the Mississippi River, managed to drop many balloons at an altitude of 11,000 feet to descend, and finally fell on a tree. He climbed down from the tree and watched his float slowly burn out. He hurried to a nearby place where he could send a telegram and sent a telegram to his wife: "Safe landing, excellent balloon control, equipment completely destroyed.</p>
<p>But in any case, after this flight, people gradually gained an understanding of his spirit. Piccard's next ascension would no longer be regarded as a joke, but as a scientific study. This is what he and many others have been looking forward to for a long time.</p>
<p>Focus of Work – Cosmic Rays</p>
<p>Piccard hopes to break the current ascent record (72,394 feet) and reach a height of 100,000 feet (approximately nineteen miles). The US Navy authorities have expressed their willingness to fund the cost of such an important voyage. Piccard plans to stay at high altitude for eight hours to allow ample time to make many scientific measurements. This is by no means something that rockets or unmanned balloons can do.</p>
<p>Most importantly, he hopes to gain a better understanding of the issue of cosmic rays, such as what cosmic rays are, why they can be duplicated, and what they can add to our current knowledge of atomic energy. In fact, we can say that Piccard was the first to use balloons to study cosmic rays. At the same time, if we ask a person with such broad interests and talents what he is most focused on, then we can immediately say that the study of cosmic rays is his main work.</p>
<p>Family Interest – Light Balloons</p>
<p>Every Sunday evening, they invited many guests to gather, and after the guests left, Piccard personally did the cleaning work. He used scientific methods to wash the dishes – using his chemical knowledge to determine which foods were best washed with soapy water and which should be washed with clean water.</p>
<p>His whole family is extremely enthusiastic about balloons. In 1934, Mrs. Piccard became the first woman to drive a balloon into the single-stream layer. On the next voyage, although the Navy Department did not allow her to accompany her husband, she was still enthusiastic about the work of an assistant. Their youngest son—Don—rose alone in a balloon in February of the year before last, and he was also the first to do so for young people. Piccard's twin brother, we know, is also a famous balloonist. He began stratospheric exploration earlier than Piccard. In 1931, he rose to 51,793 feet, and in 1932 to 54,120 feet, but now, he is planning to develop in the opposite direction—into the seabed. He will ride a spherical, free-floating submarine and dive into the seabed in the Atlantic Ocean near the equator to study everything he sees. If the plan is successful, he can sink 13,000 feet, which is almost five times the depth that others have gone to.</p>
<p>As for Jean Piccard, his eyes are still gazing at the sky, thinking about rising to a height that no one has ever been to. He mocks some people's claim that balloon travel is dangerous or too stressful, because he himself has no such feeling.</p>
<p>He said, "Some people tell me that old people are not suitable for such voyages, which is complete nonsense. Since this job has been prepared for me, I should do it well.</p>
<p>From him, we can see the spirit of a true scientist.</p>
<p>Secret Ink by Liu Suisheng</p>
<p>Military intelligence and love letters often use secret ink for communication to prevent leaks. In my spare time from studying chemistry, I have collected various types for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Paste or Rice Water – Use a brush dipped in diluted paste or rice water to write on paper. After drying, there are no traces. Sprinkle with iodine, and blue lettering will appear, very clear. Immerse in baking soda again, and the lettering will disappear.</p>
<p>(2) Ferric Chloride – Use a diluted solution of ferric chloride to write on paper. Wait until it dries, and there are no traces. Spray with potassium thiocyanate solution, and the lettering will appear blood-red. If sprayed with potassium ferrocyanide solution, the lettering will appear blue.</p>
<p>(3) Phenol – Phenolphthalein is dissolved in alcohol. Dip this solution to write a letter, and there is no color visible. Apply soap solution, and it will appear red; if you apply orange juice, the red color disappears, or sprinkle with ammonia, the lettering appears red; place on the fire and slightly bake it, and the lettering disappears again.</p>
<p>(4) Chalcanthite – Chalcanthite's scientific name is copper sulfate, dissolved in water. Dip this solution to write a letter, and it leaves no traces. Spray with ammonia, and it will appear light blue; if you sprinkle with potassium ferrocyanide solution, it will appear brown.</p>
<p>(5) Cobalt Nitrate or Cobalt Chloride – Write a letter on pink paper using the above solution, and the lettering will not be visible. Spray with potassium ferrocyanide solution, and it will appear reddish-brown. Or bake it over a fire, and blue lettering will appear; breathe on it or moisten it with water, and the lettering disappears again, so it is also known as invisible ink.</p>
<p>(6) Mercury Sublimate – Mercury sublimate is also known as mercuric chloride, which is highly poisonous. Dip this solution to write a letter, and the lettering is not visible. Spray with dilute alkaline solution, and it will appear bright yellow. Or sprinkle with potassium iodide solution, which will appear dark red; if you spray too much, the red color will fade completely.</p>
<p>(7) Green Vitriol – Green vitriol's scientific name is ferrous sulfate, which is soluble in water. Use it to write, and there are no traces. Immerse in potassium ferricyanide solution, and blue lettering will appear.</p>
<p>(8) Potassium Bromide and Sulfuric Acid – Dissolve the above-mentioned medicinal products in water and write on paper, and no lettering will appear. Burn it with fire, and it will appear golden yellow.</p>
<p>(9) Carbolic Acid – Write a letter with the above solution, and there are no traces. Spray with ferric chloride, and the lettering will appear various colors.</p>
<p>(10) Ferrous Sulfate – Use the above solution to write, and the lettering is not visible. If sprayed with tannins (commonly known as tannic acid) solution, the lettering will appear black. Strong tea can also be effective.</p>
<p>(11) Silver Nitrate – Write with the above solution on blue or black paper. After drying, there are no traces. Immerse the paper in salt water, and the lettering will appear white. Spray with potassium cyanide solution, and white lettering will also appear; but if sprayed in excess, the lettering will disappear again.</p>
<p>(12) Lead Powder or Lead Sugar – After writing with lead powder solution, blow hydrogen sulfide gas (ferrous sulfide plus hydrochloric acid), and the lettering will appear black. Write with lead sugar (scientific name lead acetate, highly poisonous) solution, and after spraying with potassium chromate solution, the lettering will appear bright yellow.</p>
<p>(13) Barium Chloride or Barium Nitrate – Dip the above solution to write on black paper, and there are no traces. Spray with diluted sulfuric acid or mirabilite, or Glauber's salt solution, and it will appear white.</p>
<p>(14) Miscellaneous – Take alum water, soda water, vegetable juice, diluted hydrochloric acid, etc. to write, and no lettering will appear. Place on the fire and bake it, and black lettering will appear immediately.</p>
<p>There are many types of secret inks, which cannot all be described; they are all based on chemical principles. As for secretly transmitting photos, there is also a clever method: the method is to immerse the photo you want to send to the other party in a mixed solution of potassium ferricyanide and ammonium bromide, and the black color will fade completely. Then send this white piece of paper. When the other party receives it, throw it into sodium sulfide solution, and the image will reappear, with a yellowish-brown color.</p>

<p>Soundless Is Better Than Sound by Wei Ni</p>
<p>The man walked across the grass, running around, pushing a small box-like object in front of him. He may be using a prospecting device! But wherever he went, the green grass was cut short.</p>
<p>The neighbors ran over to see – was he mowing the lawn? They questioned each other, but why was his lawnmower silent? But the grass two or three inches in front of it always fell down, as if it had been touched.</p>
<p>The housewife put her clothes in the washing machine and pressed the power button. The water did not move, but immediately became dirty and foamy, as if a washing cycle had been completed. In fact, in an instant, the clothes became snow-white.</p>
<p>Eye-witnesses said that the work was carried out in complete silence. They were wrong. This may be the noisiest machine in the world, but the noise is all high-pitched and inaudible to humans!</p>
<p>This is the newest scientific strategy at work. This science is ultrasound, which is about sounds that exceed the range of our ears and have very high frequencies. The best example is a dog whistle. The dog owner makes a silent whistle, but the dog can hear it several blocks away.</p>
<p>Today, in war and peace, ultrasound has obvious practical uses. Scientists at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington have used ultrasound to mow lawns, and many laundries in the UK also use ultrasound to wash clothes.</p>
<p>Those "high-pitched" sounds violently agitate the grass stems, causing them to break. In laundries or dry cleaners, the sound waves vibrate the dirt off the clothes.</p>
<p>Ultrasound is useful in a basin of water, and even greater when used at sea – saving lives lost at sea. A scientist at the University of California has developed this method.</p>
<p>Ultrasound, when often performed in water, is affected by temperature and density, and refracted downward from the water surface and upward from the bottom. Thus, at a certain depth in a drop, it can proceed in a straight line. This plane is approximately three thousand feet below the water surface. This knowledge has been used to make rescue bombs. A sinking ship throws a bomb into the water, and it will explode at a depth of three thousand feet. Receiving stations are set up on islands and along the coast, constantly receiving signals from rescue bombs. These receiving stations also receive sound waves and can determine the situation of the accident in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>This is not the first time ultrasound has been used at sea. During the war, the Navy's "Sonar" hunted submarines. The function of "Sonar" is: install an ultrasound generator on the bottom of the ship, constantly rotating in all directions. After each two-degree "pulse" is emitted, the generator is also used as a receiver. Any obstruction in the water reflects the sound back, and the submarine is located. The time it takes for the echo to arrive is used to calculate the distance of the submarine. The direction of the generator indicates the location.</p>
<p>Today, ultrasound can also be used to detect the location of icebergs, and the Titanic tragedy will never be repeated. It collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic in 1912.</p>
<p>Pointing an ultrasound generator to the bottom of the water can measure the depth of the water very accurately. Sending "pulsed" waves vertically downward, and the time it takes for the echo to arrive, can automatically and accurately indicate the depth of the water.</p>
<p>In addition, ultrasound can indicate uneven points in alloys, which is of great help in making rocket launchers, and new alloys can also be developed.</p>
<p>Finally, ultrasound can turn heavy oil into gasoline, which may become the newest and cheapest method of oil refining in the future.</p>
<p>For the human body, it can help resist bacteria. It can kill certain types of bacteria, so it can be used to disinfect or purify drinking water. In medicine, ultrasound is very promising. German scientists have pointed out that ultrasound can warm bones without injuring them.</p>
<p>But if ultrasound can save people, it may also be used to kill people, like the death sound problem proposed by General George E. Kini. Yang Bai, a gray-haired, thin inventor, whose bizarre experience is of great importance to this problem, manufactured a "high-pitched" whistle. Although the whistle is not as big as an alarm clock, it can emit 25,000 watts of sound waves (ordinary radio receivers only have one to ten watts). Once, before he understood its effects, he raised the tone of the whistle to a range higher than the auditory range and increased the volume. He didn't hear anything, only felt that the muscles on his face were very weak and loose. He increased this "silent" even more, and his fingers stiffened. He forgot what he was doing, sat there blankly, feeling numb, for five minutes. The assistants in the room had the same situation. Later, a visitor walked into the room and turned off the whistle. Yang Bai and the others did not recover for several minutes.</p>
<p>A California scientist, Dr. Nada, exposed a young female mathematician to an ultrasound generator. Although she didn't know what effect the sound waves had on her, she only felt her brain power disappear in bursts. This woman, who could do the most complex math problems normally, now couldn't even do simple addition and didn't know how much two plus two was. But she recovered in a few minutes.</p>
<p>A chemist works in front of an ultrasound generator every day. He lost his sense of balance to the point where he couldn't even ride a bicycle until his research was over.</p>
<p>Ultrasound may focus crystals at one point, just as a magnifying glass focuses sunlight, with the same result. A piece of paper placed in the radiation will catch fire.</p>
<p>Although these examples seem dangerous enough to make death sounds, in fact, ultrasound will certainly be used to save people more than to kill people in the future. The Germans had tried to make weapons from sound waves, but their conclusion was also that they were impractical. Because ultrasound loses its effectiveness very quickly in the air. Sound waves with a frequency of 10,000 cycles per second decrease by half after traveling 700 feet in the air. But in the water, it takes 240 miles to lose half. For this reason, ultrasound cannot be used to kill enemy soldiers or shoot down enemy planes. The "victim" can only be seriously affected in the same room as the generator. Because these waves are blocked by walls and any obstacles. Yang Bai's whistle was enough to paralyze them in the room. But the neighbors next door didn't feel this disturbance.</p>
<p>Ultrasound has proven impossible in terms of death sounds, so for the future of mankind, it has great development as a "living" ray.</p>
<p>Free Talk: Scraps from a Journey by Bai Yong</p>
<p>Recently, things have been rushed, and I have spent several days on the train. Fortunately, I did not catch up with the 85% price increase, otherwise my wallet would be even emptier. From Suzhou back to Shanghai, people are always so crowded. It is said that there is a train in the afternoon that specifically departs from Suzhou and is hung behind the short-distance train coming from Wuxi. Naturally, there will be seats on this train. However, this day happened to be Sunday. According to the red-hat at the train station, the military did not add trains for the weekend. It is really unclear why. Weekends are holidays, and people want to go out. Why are there no extra trains added, which is the opposite of foreign regulations? It is really confusing. So we bought second-class tickets and squeezed into third-class cars, which took a lot of effort. Even stranger, a friend brought several pecks of rice because rice is expensive in Shanghai and wanted to reduce expenses a little. Unexpectedly, it was not allowed on the train and was said to be cargo, which must be paid for as freight. The price of rice in Shanghai has suddenly risen by several hundred thousand in the past two days. It is said to be affected by freight. Does the state-owned railway have to make money from this to maintain itself?</p>
<p>When the train arrived at Waikuatang, several people selling sugar cane and dried tofu came up. One selling sugarcane was an adult and a child. At first, the adult peddled, 10,000 yuan for four sections. When the child came, it was 10,000 yuan for three sections, because the child's were longer. In an instant, the adult devalued the price to 10,000 yuan for five sections, and the child also increased to four sections, adding that: "Look at the goods, that long one is also a section, and that long one is also a section!" He cursed as he muttered. Unexpectedly, the adult devalued the price again, and the child was not to be outdone. So in half an hour, it fell from 10,000 yuan for three or four sections to seven or eight sections. Finally, they were all sold out. This time it was the turn of the people selling dried tofu. They had to sell while paying attention to the crew on the train. If a railway policeman came over, they immediately rolled up their goods and sat on the chair as passengers. Their speed was simply beyond our imagination. Of course, they also engaged in business competition as usual, and they sold out in a flash. Then they started counting banknotes on the train, piles of 10,000 yuan bills were taken out from pockets all over their bodies, and they were sorted out. Many people stared at them intently. In the end, each person's income was over a million. They arrived at a small station, made a face at each other, and jumped off. This is the most realistic price reduction competition I have ever seen. If rice shops and cloth shops had such a day, wouldn't that be great?</p>
<p>On April 4th, Children's Day, I was returning to Shanghai from Nanjing. Unexpectedly, there were people who took their children to Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang for fun. Fortunately, there was no fire that day, otherwise it would have been really disappointing. At Nanjing Station, there was still an hour before the train departed, and the seats were already full. Those who came later had to stand. A guy who looked like a civil servant saw a middle-aged mother sitting on a chair with three children, so he strongly demanded that the children give him a seat. The children naturally didn't want to, so he said with a grin: "I'm only going to Danyang. If you give it to me, I'll buy you something to eat." The children still refused and cried. The mother was kind and forced the children to come down and sit on the suitcase. The Danyang passenger sat down triumphantly with a smug smile, took out a cigarette and smoked leisurely, ignoring the children and their mother.</p>
<p>The seat next to me was constantly changing. Finally, it was a gentleman going to Wuxi and his companion. For some reason, while others were "fighting for seats", they gave way to each other. In this kind of situation, false politeness only annoys people. So a male passenger next to him took the opportunity to enter, and at the same time a female passenger also put her bag under this seat. When Wuxi arrived, the man and woman fought for it, and of course the man won. The woman stood aside silently in anger. When the Suzhou arrived, the male passenger got off again. Unexpectedly, a burly man sat down, claiming it for his girlfriend. The female passenger was angry but dared not speak, and stood all the way to Shanghai North Station. What does this show? – Roughly, this is Chinese-style survival of the fittest. As for Ladies First, it can only be applied when there are three guests and ten sofas in a spacious carriage?</p>

<p>[Our Report] In the third match of the Java-China football team, yesterday's game against Tung Wah ended in a 3-3 draw. Java-China took the lead in the first half with a score of 2-0, ending the half at 2-1. Java-China showed improvement, while Tung Wah seemed to have a loose formation, underestimating their opponent. The audience at Yih Yuen exceeded 16,000, even more crowded than the second match, with ticket revenue exceeding 700 million. Tung Wah attacked fiercely but to no avail. At 17 minutes, Chen Hongyun flicked the ball in, giving Java-China the first point. Later, Long Hai committed a handball, and Huang Shuangquan took a free kick from the center line. Bang Lun rushed out, and Luo Tianxi headed the ball into the empty net, making it 2-0. Fortunately, Xia Ti made a header pass, and Li Yao scored, ending the first half at 2-1. In the first fifteen minutes of the second half, Long Hai and Xia Ti scored successively, putting Tung Wah ahead 3-2. However, due to a relaxed attitude, Long Hai acted irregularly, and at 27 minutes, Han Nibo was penalized with a penalty kick. Luo Tianxi took the kick, but Bang Lun pushed it away only slightly. Tianxi added another kick, ending the game in a 3-3 draw. Many players from Java-China were injured.</p>
