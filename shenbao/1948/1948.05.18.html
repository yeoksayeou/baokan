<h3>安定物價首宜安定金融</h3>
<p>上星期的最後四天，由於銀根突然抽緊的結果，本市物價漸見回落，以米·油·糖·紗·布，肥皂等大宗貨物爲例，除米價所跌無幾而外，十五日的市價已比十一日低落一成至二成不等。可是昨天外匯牌價忽又靜　思動，　高百分之四十六，美滙四十七萬四千元，掛高十五萬元；英滙一百四十二萬元，掛高四十五萬元；港涵八萬八千五百零四元，掛高二萬八千零七元。物價稍稍安定，而金融却又不安定起來了。所以不問物似今後能否繼續渡落。以及此項疲勢尙能延續多久，假如抑平物價，單靠這些抽緊銀根以及壓迫證券市塲等等突擊手段，而不從限制發行，利導游資，穩定外滙，扶權生產這些根本辦法設想，那未我們覺得似乎總欠正常，而且也太不澈底了。</p>
<p>這理由是很淺顯的。銀根抽緊以後，如能捏住不放，使市塲能保持相當的安定狀態，則在沒有其（他新因素的條件之下，物價的漲風，或不致乘隙再燃。若一暴十寒，時緊時鬆則一時抽緊的功效，未必全屬有效。</p>
<p>現在內滙和運現的限制，雖沒有放鬆，但在私運夾帶，和物資移動等方式之下，各地遊資流滬的數目，仍極可觀。自從東北流通劵准許交流，華北華中匪患益深，而華南物價又以通貨過剩，其上漲率竟超過上海，致形成了資金的倒流。在這種形勢之下，縱使回籠之法幣不再放出新法幣不再增發，本市的銀根，亦未必能長此抽緊；何况這點起碼的希望、事實上亦未必能做倒？</p>
<p>工商事業之發展，其最主要的條件爲安定，而金融上的安定，尤爲促進事業的樞紐。因爲融通，利息，滙兌等項，如果變化　常？不可捉摸，則一初損益，均將無從計算，而惟是東奔西波，以勉　其日常之難關，當然談不到甚麽發展了。如果應付失當，周轉不靈，則星星之火，可以燎原，更有引起或大或小的風波之可能。故金融當局的唯一職能，端在默察機先，酌盈劑虛，以求市面之安定，斷沒有反其道而行之，故使金融市塲多所波動或甚至釀成騷亂的道理。</p>
<p>所謂抽緊銀根，其意在抑平物價，亦未嘗不可以力謀安定自　。不過未漲以前，旣沒有鑒往知來，逐漸收縮，以爲綢繆未雨之計，而徒於事後，張皇補草，實施突擊，使許多工商家措手不及，齊陷於非常困難之境，這　是維護工商之正當辦法？况道種手法，以前也嘗一再試過，並未能把物價確實安定起來。其短期庫券的發行，原說是吸收遊資，抑平物價的有效方法，却又沒有審時度勢，充分地加運用，而依舊要仗這突擊的手段來，於漲風異常熾烈以後，施以迎頭的痛；這在打擊投機，痛　囤積這一點上說，雖未嘗不是痛快的舉動，但在整個的經濟上看來，其代價也未免太重了。</p>
<p>當然，我們並不顧爲與風作浪的抬價奸商作辯護，但亦不願見正當的工商業，在這種突擊式的作風下，一再飽　人爲的痛苦，致加深他們的危機。換句話說：抑平物價，是人間此心的，抽緊銀根，亦是心　比理的。但游資充斥，由來已久，並不是突發的急症，亦不輩是臨時　敎所能奏效。當局如真爲賺收遊資和抑平物價着想，應該拿定方針，從多方面不斷地努力；在漲風旣起以後，固不應袖手旁觀，讓它奔騰澎湃，漫無止境，而在比較的緩和時期，亦應當釜底抽薪，標本兼施，以免積久汜濫，一發而不可收拾。</p>
<p>大漲之後，必有小回。這幾日漲風稍稍回平了，抽緊銀根的人們，或者要躊躇滿志，認爲馬到成功了吧，我們却以爲一般正當的工商家帶累太重，而照過去幾度的成例看來，所謂夾　式的抽緊銀根，其效益亦復有限。所以盼望他們更進一步，作持久性與有計劃的措施，毋使漲風與突擊一再重演，新　工商界的元氣。</p>
<p>現在實銷依　朱動，內地有許多勢，其物價尙落在本埠之後，就本埠論，許多批發行盤，亦遠落在廠盤之後，足證最近這次五月漲風，與銀根鬆濫，的確有因果關係。所以安定金融，應是安定物價的重大前提。但短時間的偶發的突然抽緊，毋寗說是擾亂的成分居多，還談不上眞正的安定，何况在物價小回而稍平之際，又來一次外匯牌價掛高的刺激呢？</p>

<h3>華北水泥工業王座</h3>
<p>— 本報記者李紹林</p>
<p>啟新洋灰公司唐山廠近貌</p>
<p>〔本報天津航訊〕最近有一個機會去唐山，得以實地參觀了華北最大水泥工業啓新洋灰公司唐山工廠，這個擁有工人三千餘人的大規模水泥工業，目前產量每日爲五百噸，最高產量可以達到一千噸。戰亂阻碍了建設，洋灰無用武之地、華北方面壓根沒有鉅大銷塲、華南方而雖有相當需要，而運輸却有不可克服的困難，各種因素，造成這建設的基本工業之减產，這現象今日正普遍反映於各地輕重工業，是一幕無比的悲劇。啓新的負責人一如其他工業的主持者，他們迫切的喊出需要安定。在啓新工廠，現在存有製成的洋灰二萬餘噸，已燒妥待磨的熟料十餘萬噸，時價總計在一萬二千億元以上，如此鉅量成品的堆積，不斷增加着資金週轉的困難最近他們正努力於拓展</p>
<p>南洋市場</p>
<p>希望闖出一條生路。</p>
<p>洋灰工業之出現於唐山，　在光緒十五年，當時粵人唐景星氏首創士敏土廠於該地，設備簡陋，技術亦不佳，而尤其不可思議的，是燒製洋灰所需的灰石，竟是遠自廣東採運，由於成本過高，成品滯銷，此士敏土廠到光緒十九年即告關閉。光緒二十六年周致德氏重辦此廠，並且聘請德人昆德爲工程師，綱昆德發現工廠附近的石山，整　是洋灰原料石灰石，不過這工廠開工不久，就遭逢拳匪之亂　又告停工。亂平繼續恢復，光緒三十二年才正式註册爲唐山啓新津灰公司，光緒三十三年改稱啓新洋灰股份有限公司，直到現在，昆德發現的石山，數十年來不斷開掘，石山由頂到底已被掘成一條鴻溝，　今仍然是啟新洋灰的來源。</p>
<p>燒製洋灰的主要原料是石灰石，另外遷要加入紅土，黃砂以及鐵石，牠們的成份，完全要經過化驗，作適當的配合，</p>
<p>燒制程序</p>
<p>並不太複雜，第一步是把石灰石，紅土或黃砂，鐵石加以摻合，磨碎，次一程序便是送入溫度攝氏一千四百度的窑內加熱，最後一步程序是把燒好的熟料摻以適量石膏（百分之三十至三十五），再加水，在攝氏一百度以下的溫度中磨碎成粉，就成了用途廣泛的洋灰。此一工業，技術方面，完全在化學成份的控制，其中石膏是一項大量的消耗，每出洋灰五百噸，約需要石膏一百七十五噸，啓新所用的石膏，戰前多從太臣購來，以後也向湖北顧城採買，現在交通阻塞，國內已不能大量購到，幾乎完全仰給國外了。啓新的是原料燃料的供</p>
<p>絕大優點</p>
<p>應極爲便利，靠着開　煤礦，燃料從不會發生問題，至於主要原料石灰石，產地距工廠不滿一里，有軌距十八吋的小鐵路自石山直達工廠，完全利甩山的坡度修築，往程空軍以騾馬拖引，返　遝料進廠則不需要任何動力。廠內設備，第一步是強力鋼磨，將原料　爲細粉，其次就進入摻合廠加以調和，然後被送入旋窖加熱，在一千四百度的旋窰內加熱四十分鐘，即成爲灰塊熟料，熟料加石膏再入鋼磨碾磨，就是洋灰成品。從石料磨碎到成品入倉，完全是整套聯繫的設備，其中旋窖是最主要設備，煤粉在軸心燃燒，石粉在外圍活動烘烤，自進口至出口所經的時間，恰是需要烘烤的時間，啓新現在有旋窰八個，最大的日產二百五十噸，爲美國製品，最小的日產八十噸，是啓新修機廠所自護的。</p>
<p>華北的水泥工業，除啓新以外，還有華北水泥公司，太原西北洋灰公司，東北方面另有工廠，現在西北公司成品無法輸出，華北水泥公司及東北工廠則已在砲火逼迫下停工，僅祗啓新還能維持</p>
<p>生產不輟</p>
<p>而現在正是在苦難中掙扎着，當年的盛况直如黃梁夢境，諸如靑島碼頭，津浦路黃河橋，淮河橋，廣州海珠橋，上海市政府，南京中山陵，中央體育塲，在戰前都是以啓新洋灰修建的，而今却難得再嗅到大規模建設的氣息，這資格最老規模最大的民族工業，看看要有癱瘓的危險了。</p>
<p>戰時後方由於水泥缺乏，在四川　江曾有一灰土代水泥製造廠的成立，當時產量每日一百桶，各方視同瑰寳，目前這規模龐大的水泥工業，却在受着戰亂不安的識嘲，豈不是一個對民族的諷刺。</p>

<h3>日本政府昨政式公布　經濟復興五年計劃　提高生產求達戰前水準　屈拉普力主扶植日本使能自給自足</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播：美國陸次屈拉普十七日向世界協會演說稱，美國如不無盡期救濟日本，則應　揩日本經濟復興計劃，使日本能臻於自給自足之境。屈氏要求立即解決賠償問題，增加日本出口至少每年爲十四億元，以償付食糧及原料。渠稱，不然美國必須每年　　償付四億美元，以供佔領及供給日人糧食之用。屈氏並謂，茍欲使遠東　榮，因日本發動殘暴戰爭而引起之憎恨與仇視，必須逐漸予以放棄。此在歐洲方面，饒恕前敵國之思想已漸抬頭，德國西部已被參加歐洲復興計劃各國視爲不應漠視之一部份。屈氏力言賠償問題必須迅予解決，俾使日人有所適從。</p>
<p>〔路透社束京十七日電〕日本政府頃公布經濟安定部所擬之復興經濟五年計劃預定於一九五二年恢復日本經濟至戰前之水準。該計劃強調日本之經濟復典，有賴於外國資本之協助，目前之通貨膨脹，在五年計劃施行之上半期內，即以减輕而不致對經濟安定有所威脅。復認日本目前之危機已屬根深蒂固，不僅爲表面觀象。該計劃穩定經濟之目標在（一）使人民有合理的生活標準，不慮日用必需品之匱乏。（二）日本之輸出足以抵付其輸入；（三）勞工之效能及生產能力右顯著的提高，該計劃並估計日本之人口至一九五二年約將達八千三百萬人，該計劃並謂限制日本經濟復興之因素有下列數點：（一）燃料電力之供應；（二）原料之輸入及（三）運輸工具之缺乏。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十七日電〕日政府今晨公佈日本經濟安定本部官員九個月來苦心擬定之五年計劃草案，此項計劃之重要目的，係將日工業恢復戰前水準，生活標準恢復至一九三四年水準。根據此項計劃，預料至一九五二年時出口將增加九倍，礦業及製造工業生產　加三倍，勞動生產力及國民收入增加二倍。以一九三〇至三四年時期之水準來作比較，關於礦業及製造工業之歡字，係增加至百分之一百卅而非百分之百，換言之，即煤產量達四千四百萬一噸而非三千一百萬噸，組鋼三百十四萬噸而非二百七十二萬二千二百噸，普通鋼鐵二百卅萬噸而非二百十九萬五千噸，棉紗價値九億九千萬美元而非十一億五千七百萬美元。每年出口將　十六億四千六百萬美元，每年進口亦達與進口相同之數字。關於生活標　每日以加羅里計算之，食糧消費單位估計將達二千一百十一，而戰前則爲二千二百四十二加　里。此一五年計劃之主要形態，係着重於外資之　入。據消息靈通方面稱，此項計劃之首次草案中，本欲定自美國輸入十六億美元，但佔領軍當局由於深恐美與論對此有不利之反響，故命令在該項計劃內，不必提起此一龐大之數字。</p>

<h3>美對蘇政策目標求歐洲均勢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕據可靠方面權威息，美國在上週向蘇聯關閉之「洞開之門戶」，此後將繼續關閉，直至歐洲恢復其勢力均等。現興奮時期已過，美蘇「和平」談判亦已消逝，而下列各因素將成爲視綫之中心：</p>
<p>（一）美國目前不擬進行於蘇結束「冷戰」之任何談判，在若干時期內亦不擬如此。（二）歐洲均勢將於西歐在經濟與政治上穩定以前不能恢復，而經濟與政治之安定，須於長期實施馬歇爾計劃之後。（三）目前如與蘇聯進行任何談判，僅發覺蘇聯握有最多權力，而此爲對武力政治佔優勢之舉。（四）西方強國在目前已放棄根據集體安全之原則，成立世界統治機構之希望，而急於恢復彼等所謂之「均勢」，均勞實即西方佔優勢力量之謂。</p>

<h3>華萊士建議蘇報表示歡迎</h3>
<p>〔路邊社列期科十六日電〕蘇聯報紙討論美蘇關係之際，歡迎美第三黨總統候選人華萊士上週致史達林公開信中所提之若干建議，認華氏之建議，切實而合選輯，顯示其有覓取方法以解決兩國異見之誠意。蘇報對華氏所建議各點中表示贊成之數點，乃普　裁軍，禁止具有集團破壞力威的武器，禁止任何國對任何他國　出武器，不得干涉他國內政，放乘在他國境內之軍事基地，外國軍隊自朝鮮撤退，不得干涉中國內部事件，增加貿易，發展文化關係，及設立國際救濟機構等。　理報之評論，曾節述史達林最近所稱之語，「蘇美　國當然可以互相合作，此兩制度既能在戰時合作，何以不能在水平時期合作」　日，美政府代表所發表之和平言論，於估計國際局勢之際，故作悲觀論調，因此在美人民中造成戰爭　覺的心理，國際局勢乃每况愈下。華萊士君却已提出別的建議，他請美國恢復羅斯福的政策，他的實力即因此而得。經驗　示在羅斯福時代，反希特勒諸強間的異見，固莫不能迎刃而解。華萊士君的具體建議與美蘇政府代表的官方言論並不抵　，然美政府代表的行爲，則一再與其言論相脫離。美外交官之所謂堅決外交，及報紙之所謂冷戰，意在迫使蘇聯接受美國對於一切任何問題的意見，其實此等手段決不能有何結果，惟華萊士所稱史密斯莫洛托夫換文之公布，爲對於美蘇雙方認爲美蘇不能和平相處的宣傳家之重大打擊，則非吾人所能茍同，蓋蘇聯境內固從無亦決不致有此等宣傳家故也。</p>

<p>辛氏稱，每聞有人談稱三年後必有另一次世界大戰，實屬不幸，「吾人應向國內外人土明白宣佈，吾人身爲勞工社會運動之一份子，不希望再有戰爭。然善意不是單方面的，吾人希望他人亦即戰時元老盟友，在相互尊視及容忍之基礎上，能够合作無間」。渠駁斥美援將淪歐洲爲美國奴隸之論調。渠稱，國內政策上，（一）不能回到無限制之自由企業。（二）工黨不擬與保守黨合組緊急聯合內閣，蓋「吾人不願爲保守黨之入幕賓而取悅反對社會主義之反動派」。（三）工業設備應全部改革，以期精益求精而提高產額。（四）工黨不能容忍其黨員有不逞行爲，蓋英國人民甚至世界之前途，皆在工黨手中。</p>

<p>（一）公用事業價格計算公式，自本年度施行以來，尙能使各項公用事業價格循合理軌道，溫和上漲，自四月份起，始見上漲較多。計算公式中若千基數，容或因情勢變遷，有待於擬訂者，應由地方政府斟酌實際情形，擬具意見，送主管機關硏究。若干公用事業基數有因核算不嚴，以致過高者，應由地方政府對於民營公用事業從嚴審核。各地參議會可提供意見，備供參酌，最後呈由中央主管機關核定。國營或公營之公用事業，則由主辦機關從嚴審核，呈由中央主管機關核定。</p>
<p>（二）地方政府審核各項價格如在各種指數跳動太劇之時，地方政府得斟酌情形，予以核减，並得不受百分之十之限制。</p>
<p>（三）各公用事業由中央及地方主管機關責成各該　業提高工作效率，减低成本，並由本會參酌各地情形，硏擾基數之修訂。</p>
<p>（四）各地方政府應會同各地軍政機關及民意機構，協助各地公用事業，防止　電　水及違章無票乘軍等情事，以利經營。</p>
<p>（五）工廠用煤爲提高品質，减少浪費，建議先在礦塲設法洗煤。</p>

<h3>適應出口業之需要　平衡會昨調整匯價　美匯提高十五萬元英匯提高四十五萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕平準會昨晨調整外匯掛牌價格，各指定銀行之外匯牌價基準率如次：（一）獎匯四十七萬四千元，計提高十五萬元，（二）英匯一百四十二萬二千元，計提高四十五元，（三）印匯十萬六千四百六十四元八角四分，計提高三萬三千六百九十一元四角，（四）港匯八萬入千五百〇四元六角九分，計提高二萬八千〇七元八角一分。指定銀行之丰續費亦有調整，美匯提高爲六千元，英匯爲二萬元。</p>
<p>據向有關方面探悉：此次外匯掛牌價格之調整，完全爲適應出口之需要，惟調整之數字殊不如一般預期之大。又昨日外匯掛高後，　機及日用品市塲雖受刺激，終以銀根之緊，均甚穩定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於匯價與物價的關係，記者昨特　訪　負責當局，據稱：匯價的決定，是由各指定銀行代表與本會委員，每天上午九時開會商討決定，在九點半以前，用電話通知各指定銀行。所以外間傳說，可以預先先知道，是絕不可能的事。</p>
<p>匯價調整的標準，原則上是根據物價。但是由於一般人對於外匯牌價與物價的關係多有誤解，以爲匯價有刺激的作用，所以牌價常常不能充分調整。計自去年八月十九日至最近止，上海物價上漲十倍，外匯牌價僅上漲七倍，至於黑市外匯，則上漲十五倍，所以本會的匯價，是落在一般物價之後的。所以牌價的調整，只要不超過黑市外匯，就不能影響進口貨物的售似。同樣出口雖按牌價結匯，但是因爲政府的收購與出口貨款等，出口物價也是超過牌價外匯的，一般國內貨物的價格與牌價外匯的關係，　　微淺。所以牌價的調整，只要不超過一般物價與黑市外匯，就沒有提高物價的作用。</p>
<h3>銀根尚未松弛　紗布欲漲無力</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開受美滙掛高刺激，人心一度振奮，更以上週末下跌過鉅，一部業外商趁低吸納。嗣因銀根仍緊，紡建公司配售頻繁，欲振乏力。四十二支藍鳯細紗開後，同業頭寸軋緊，逢高斬售，跌至二億八千五百萬元。迨至臨收，浮空有補，稍見回上，卒以二億九千二百萬元收盤，比週末續跌一千萬元。水月及金城亦挫九百萬至一千萬元。四十支各牌亦降五六七百萬元，二十一支雙馬紗套利交易旺盛，散戶拉抬，回漲一千萬。其餘三十二支及二支十六支等粗細紗，較前軋升三四五百萬元不一。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况外滙雖然掛高，但紡建公司臨時懸牌開售，銀根續見抽緊，市氣欲振乏力。十二磅龍頭細布初開五百八十八萬，步小八十五萬有成交，嗣得外滙之惠，各方抬似爭吸，市盤哄上至六百十八萬元，人心混亂，漢口帮逢高有拋售，山西帮買進居多，染廠頗鮮進出，號家取捨不一，臨收時回低至五百九十五萬元結束，終較週末再降十萬元。最後散戶斬結甚夥，價竟再低至五百八十五萬元有售出。其他各細布漂布粗布　嘰等亦都軋降十餘萬元不一、</p>
<p>又訊紡建公司十點半掛牌，特配布疋卅五種，十二磅龍頭細布價爲五百九十四萬元，四君子元嗶嘰五百八十三萬，雷峯塔元直貢六百三十萬，跳魚精元府綢六百二十萬，一定如意漂布六百九十萬，申請者甚稀。</p>
<h3>自備外匯車輛輪胎　價購限期寬放一月</h3>
<p>中信局處理無證自備外匯貨品內，稅則第四八一號西藥，第二五六甲號卡車，第二五六乙號吉普車，第六四四丁號輪胎四項，聽候政府價購貨品，依照行政院核定原案，進口商應自承購之日，於一個月內，聽候價購不得自由運銷，除經公告外，並與原進口商簽訂之優先承購合約內訂明，一面通知國防部，指定代表，逕向原進口商洽購。茲以此項貨品，由　進口商承購後，辦理報關提貨手續所需時間，往往超出一個月限期，而國防部方面洽購此項貨品，必須在貨色提出騐明品質後，方能決定，是否需要，勢實在原限期內洽妥價購。現聞經由國防部代表商請將限期延長，以應事實需要，即自承購之日起，於兩個月內聽候政府價購</p>
<h3>貼放第四次委員會　通過收購武漢煤斤</h3>

<h3>行局到期借款　四聯嚴令催收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四聯總處有鑒於以往核定各行局庫承辦之放款，近常有到期後申請展期者，按新貸款業務方針之規定，四聯總處及各分支處對業務貸叔案件不再直接核辦，故已通知各行局庫凡到期借款，應一律嚴予催收清結。如借款人必須續借時，應向原承放行局另案由請，轉呈總同核辦</p>

<h3>華股供源雖盛　臨收已有反動</h3>
<p>華股昨中途不脫疲境，外匯之調整，不敵銀行帮代大戶斬多之供源，但逢低已呈一拉鋸，助買因素及銀根轉鬆，臨一收已起反動。</p>
<p>晨初仍疲，永紗開二五七〇元低盤，開後牌價見改，人心一振。進至二七一〇元高價。代辦費開高爲三三元及三七元，銀根迫使明暗愈拔愈開，又跌至二五九五元。紗布見穩，午收升爲二六四〇元。較前收計信誼火柴均平中泥升半成，　　跌半成，餘股榮辱俱見。</p>
<p>後市永紗先穩，開二六八〇元，曾進至二七〇〇元，脫手不少，再退至二六四〇元。國行　進不若理想之多，圈外亦已回穩，臨收盤漲到二七二〇。銀行帮及大戶逢高力拋，收市二七一〇元。收後續穩，較晨收計中法新光升半成，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票漲跌甚徽</p>
<p>公債昨略堅挺，成交三百萬。統丙晨開二一萬八，自二一萬四盤升至二三萬四，而後小回。較前收計甲乙升四千元，丙丁戊各漲七千元。</p>
<p>外股昨未免不振，成交因中途査帳而見滯。怡紗晨開四六八萬，自四七二萬起盤低至四四五萬左結束。無甚特殊變化，不過屈服於銀根耳。較上週六計業廣怡　鋼業各跌半成左右，紙版平平，餘股俱告小挫。</p>
<h3>臺幣匯率掛低</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十七日電〕台幣與法幣匯率，合灣銀行十七日掛牌爲一比三三四元，校十五日掛低十四元。</p>
<h3>絲綢由疲轉堅</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市盤旋徽升，一二〇號金三馬有光上午開盤即期價在三億六千七百萬元左右，外匯牌價掛高，終因銀根全面緊俏，欲漲無力。午收即期做七千萬元，隔日期套利高達七千九百萬元，下午最大曾做八千一百萬元。旋悉銀根又告抽緊，被迫下降至七千萬元關內，最後做七千二百萬元賣出價，比上週六大起五百萬元之譜。</p>
<p>廠經昨日疲軟，因業內外人受銀根緊迫影響，俱告束手，故交易奇寂。各級五担有單十貨均乏成交，喊價較上週六略軟。高零担五天期款做四億八千萬元，即期款六千萬元，亦有成交。干經普通　担仍在三億五千萬元左右</p>
<p>經貨昨市先疲後堅、華強眞絲被面，上午開市即期價在一億六千七百萬元左右，後聞外匯掛高，人心稍振遂告上揚，收市即期做七千五百五十萬元，隔日套利高至三百萬元。大誠格子　　棧單交易甚稀，行情未見起色，昨市五十九萬元有成交。</p>
<h3>食糧市況堅定</h3>
<p>米市初市平線，後因外匯掛高，人心頓堅，本　納胃遂見開暢。去化活潑，貨主乃趁機扳價，市况即轉首回升，收市時更見堅俏，終較上週六收市升十萬元。市塲報價雖照上週原盤，然收市價格須加十萬元。北市塲白粳及薄稻均呈平定，碾埠秈則漲五萬至十萬元。昨日二市塲到貨共四千八百三十五石。</p>
<p>麵粉價又下挫，北帮因感銀根緊，靑島價小，反在市上回出，而中信局續聯合各廠拋售，價爲一百八十萬送到，惟因實銷呆，祗售出千包之譜。兵船粉由一百八十萬開市，最低至一百七十七萬，收市一百七十八萬。老車亦以一百七十八萬收市，各跌七萬元。紅蜂建成各小五六萬，雜牌本街尙有納取，交易略有做開。麩皮初升後小，軋跌萬元。小麥再低十五萬。</p>
<p>雜糧回升，黃豆本街及油廠供有納取，漲十五萬元。乍　最後二百九十萬元，苞米靑島帮雖有納取，但數量不多，略加十萬。紅糧內地酒坊去化，漲二十萬。菉豆高貨本街化活，挺二十萬。芝蔴平穩。生仁廣帮少胃，略加一二十萬元、</p>
<p>食油　開漲尙不多，豆油棧單爲一千二百二十萬，後投機散戶活動，買氣大盛。大有豆油一千三百萬，漲八九十萬。生菜油亦挺七八十萬，生油到貨少，市更昻。吉桶生油一千五百萬，軋漲一百七十萬。小車蔴油漲五十萬，豆餅亦隨之而活，長字餅一百三十四萬生仁記在一百三十二三萬，漲起七八萬。</p>

<h3>津區世運籃球隊　友誼賽首遭敗北　大公以七四比五一苦戰告捷</h3>
<p>全運結東後第一次籃球友誼賽，天津區世運預選代表隊對本市大公籃球隊，昨晚七時在陜西南路市體育館交鋒，觀衆近千，錢旭滄發明之電動計時機開始應用，成績殊佳。</p>
<p>賽前大公獻旗客隊，由隊長劉學錡接受，津區出塲者傳金聲，唐振聲，王琦，王文麒，張長　。大公以蔡文華，蔡忠強，黃柏齡，屠文龍，蔡迎科應戰，裁判鄭志芳，宣鶴　。鳴笛開賽，津區唐振聲籃下托入，先開紀錄，連率罰中後，津傳金聲中的，以四比一前導，柏齡雙手抓入，津王元祺亦告破籃，三對六大公呼停。津唐振聲再建一功，大公柏齡文華連科三元迎中，九比八初度超出。但津區竟肯示弱，張長　　金聲各中紅心，大公二次呌停，文龍單手擲入文華籃下托進，十四對十四，十六對十六，兩度平等。　大公蔡文章入代蔡忠強，津區亦以李漢亭替出王元祺，文華一投，大公超出，然津區王琦傳金聲迎珠砲發，廿一對十八又告超出，大公三停，蔡忠強入代黃柏齡，文華奮發，一氣呵成五分，再加文章一隻，廿七對廿六再度超出，津區以趙振綿調傳金聲，不久前半　了，卅一對卅一，平分秋色。</p>
<p>休息再戰，大公以詹　換文華，律區傳金聲劉學琦王元祺進塲，調出張長祿李漢亭趙振綿。接觸後，詹琛先中，　科文章二罰頻添數分，津區亦有所獲，卅八對卅七後，文章破籃，王琦擲　供入，各四十又成平手。大公文龍文章接連　中，大公抬頭，津區呼停，大調人馬，大公亦以黃柏齡替　文章，大公氣勢益盛，文龍有投必中，瞬以五十六對四十三遙領，天津又呌停，而以王元祺代李漢亭，但仍無起色，反觀大公更見猖獗，六十三對四十六時，文華文章重入，使出混身解數，津區一籌莫展，迨時問告終，津區以五十一對七十四首遭失利，雙方戰績如下：</p>

<p>菲島黑白籃球隊此次來滬未曾參加全運角　，故爲觀摩並聯絡起見，特由領隊　　發與此　籃　會　　　　滄洽商，決定　各友隊比賽數塲，今晚第一仗定七時半起在體育館與津區世運預選隊對壘，賽前另有女子籃球賽一　雲南水質隊與前綫交兵，門票樓上十萬，樓下廿萬，對號座四十萬，下午三時開始發售，仍由四維童子軍到塲維持秩序。</p>

<p>黑白—津區（男）七時半劉荷生金伯陶</p>
<p>按黑白乃菲島勁旅，前年首次來滬，因天寒影響，作戰未能盡量發揮，此次捲土重來，必能一新球迷耳目，應下　雄若老將蕭華陀，以及傳永信，葉克熙，莊玉　輩，胥屬菲島苜流名手，鬥力之強，不下於　聲。津區昨首次漏臉，雖告失利，惟上半　能與大公分　抗體，足證亦非弱者，其快速戰術極　觀衆　于今與菲將會師、勢有一番精彩表演。</p>
<p>賽前女子友戰，本市前綫　戰雲南之水　隊，客軍此次不遠千里而來，未獲代表　省出席全運，深以爲憾，故決與滬上娘中軍周旋，前曾在全運會塲中與湖北南京二度會仗，獲得勝利，可見並非　下阿蒙之流，前綫乃本市新興勁旅，擁有全運代表王務　朱敏等好手，與　　　英並　海壖娘子軍中鐵軍，此番對客隊定有發揮，屆時鹿死誰手，難以　料。</p>

<h3>全運新聞　在一秒鐘之間　可繞地球數周　少數人在會場播送　千萬人靜靜地收聽</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「黃婉貞打破全國紀錄！……二百公尺接力賽馬華，廣州兩隊都打破全國紀錄……」無綫電中傳出游泳比賽的緊張情况。</p>
<p>在數日前，當台灣短　名將張立郞奪二百公尺第一名之後，無綫電中傳出他的聲普：「二百公尺賽跑結果，我跑了第一，很數喜。」不過，這幾句話是台灣田徑指導敎他說的，他　跑好，氣喘喘地不知該對話　說甚麽好。記者適在他的身傍，所以知道這點「内幕」。</p>
<p>當你走進全運會的　徑塲，就看見西司令台兩側，豎立着兩個白色的亭子上面漆　「上海電台」和XORA等字樣，這就是播送體育新聞的樞紐。</p>
<p>在中國體育消息的大規模廣播，還是創舉。同時，不僅上海市區的無綫電聽衆可以收聽，還由國內各地，中央廣播事業委員會所屬各電台轉播。</p>
<p>在田徑塲上，或游泳池畔，手中拿了一個話筒、定來走去的，是話劇演員陳述他們身邊，還有一位工友，背了一個匣子，旁邊插着　悍天棧、這就是超短波發射機。</p>
<p>陳述君把他當時看到的情形報告出來，由超短波傳到西司令台傍的電訊站、再　對講電話綫送到大西路上海電臺，播送給　綫聽衆們。</p>
<p>聽起來好像步驟很煩，事實上，報告員請出來以後，差不多立即在無綫電中聽到。因爲無綫電波的速度。是不能用普通標準來衡量的，它一秒鐘，就可以繞地球數週。</p>
<p>除了對講電話綫以外，電訊站中還裝置新進口的F.M.超短波定向發射機，它傳出的聲音決不會改變，也不會受到雜普的騷擾。</p>
<p>這次全運廣播是　全運　告委員會和上海電台合辦的。全運廣告委員會時請了許電多影明星和話劇演員參加廣播，但由於興趣和時問，僅有陳述一人參加，其餘報告員，都是上海電台自行派定的。</p>
<p>報告的工作是緊張的，一秒鐘也不能停止，陳述一會兒趕到四百公尺跳攔的終點，一會兒又到擲標槍的塲子上，到處來去，報告當時比賽情形。</p>
<p>不論田徑賽塲，籃球塲和游泳池都有報告　在那裏活動，不斷報告比賽情形，分別在九〇〇KC和一二九〇KC播送</p>
<p>這種廣播工作，區吃力但這些廣播員們，都利用這個機會學習，爲中國廣播事業開　一條新路。</p>

<h3>「父敎育母實業」的學園　南通學院近貌</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>四十年來，爲中國造就了大批實習人才的南通學院，它於華路藍襖中起家，經過千磨萬刦，到現在還在荆棘重重的環境中。爲了建設新中國而作育一羣有力的第二代，並且高據在蘇北敎　的寳座上，成爲這一塊有待於開發的沃土上的曳引機。</p>
<p>張季直先生喊出「父敎育，母實業」的口號，當光緒末葉，他的實業基礎已告穩定的時候，於是農科·醫科·和紡織三個專家，便在他「實業所以　敎育之本。敎育所以儲實業之才」的原則下，先后創辦，而形成了今日南通學院的雛形。</p>
<p>南通學院承受着幾十年來一貫的傳統作風，到現在還是分紡織·農·醫三科。這三科的由分而合，由草創而擴展，有着一頁艱辛的奮鬥史。</p>
<p>農科創自光緒卅二年，是三科中歷史最久的一科，起初稱爲師範農科，爲通州師範的一部份。宣統元年，添設監　科，二年改爲初高兩等農業學校。改大學是民國八年的事，到了十七年，正式併入南通學院。醫科於民國元年創辦，名義是醫科專門學校。以後光後增設南通醫院，產科傳習所，中醫科，助產護士講習班等。直到民國十六年，改稱醫科大學。次年，即併到南通學院。在南通學院所有的科系中，紡織科該是最値得驕傲的一個學科。它的前身「紡織染傳習所」，是中國第一座創辦的紡織學校，而經過創辦者，以及歷屆的主持者數十年來之慘淡經營，已經使南通學院的紡織科成爲遠東的設備完善，成績優良的一個學府。前後二十九屆畢業的八百多位學生，每一位都是中國紡織界有力的幹部。勝利後，政府接收敵僞數百萬紗錠而成立的中紡公司，其中一半以上的工程人員，都是從南通學院紡織科黨陶出來的學生。「紡織染傳習所」自民國元年創校後，到了第二年自己才有了固定的校舍，幷改爲紡織專門學校，民國十六年和醫科同時改稱爲紡織大學，併入南通學院，是改大後次年的事。</p>
<p>經過無限的曲折，紡織，醫，農三科，總算於乎民國十七年在同一個名義下，合併成爲一個具體的高等學府。不過，由於種種關係，眞正地統一管理，還是開始於民國二十五年　亦同先生接長院務的時候。</p>
<p>改組的事，告一段落。南通學院正開始向新的道路上邁進。廿六年戰事忽起。南通地近戰區，不得不暫停上課。一年以後，才遷移到上海復課。醫科則隨軍西撤到湖南，奉部令和江蘇醫政學院合併而成江蘇醫學院。南通學院的醫科，在抗戰期問算是一度中斷。</p>
<p>勝利歸來　重建學府</p>
<p>勝利後，於三十五年秋，開始復校工作。一方面呈准敎育部恢復醫科，一方面把在上海苦撐八年的紡·農兩科整頓，其間當然又經歷了不少的艱辛。</p>
<p>南通學院的原址，經過八年多敵僞的盤據，校舍，設備，損失的很多。然而經過一年多來學校當局的說意經營，已經漸漸地恢復舊規。當你經過南通城南的啓秀路的時候，看到那分列在東西南北，四面的四座大廈，和弦誦洋洋之聲，一定會體念到明日的南通學院，該有一個如何美麗的遠景</p>
<p>南通學院現有的三科中，計分農　，農藝化學，畜牧獸醫，農業經濟（農科），紡織工程，染化工程（紡織科）等六系。醫科暫不分系。總計學生八百五十餘人。敎授大部份是本院的校友。上課的地址紡織，染化，和畜牧獸醫三系的三·四年級在上海；紡織科兩系的一·二年級在南通城南的唐家鎭，其餘都在南通的校本部。對於全部遷同南通，集中授課的計劃，一直在南通學院當局的計劃中。可是爲了遷就敎授的關係，染化，紡織，和畜牧獸醫三系的高年級，不得不留在上海。至於紡科之在唐家閘，純係因爲靠近大生紗廠，如談遷回南通，那就必得添購紡織機械，以作學生實習之用，這在目前學校的經濟上，是不可能的事。</p>
<p>當前困難　籌措經済</p>
<p>南通學院當前的困難是經濟問題。規定的學費，比上海一般私校的學費要少。因此，一學期的學費收入，僅敷兩個月的開支。共餘四個月的支出，都要仰給於校董會——也就是大生紗廠，基於張季直先生的「實業所以　敎育之才」的理想，這原是當年沓公經營實業的初衷，可是學校一味地依賴着實業，則學校之興褻，每易隨實業之降替而爲轉移。當目前經濟瀕於崩潰的邊綠，工業界充　着不景氣的時候，南通學院實在應當有一個自給自足的計劃才行。</p>
<p>前面曾經提到農·醫·紡織三科於十七年合併爲南通學院的事，其實當時南通學院校方的計劃是改爲南通大學，其後敎部以科系尙欠完備，於十九年准以南通學院的名義備案。二十年來，南通學院的每一位師生，一直在惦念着這個問題。復員以後，學校中又開始澎　着這改大的狂瀾。當然，改大以後，有很多地方會獲得不少的方便，然而，復員伊始，在各方面的條件下，要想增設科系，的確有許多困難之處。</p>
<p>其實，改大與否，是形式上的事情。而今日南通學院在作育下一代人才，以爲新中國建設而努力的責任和使命，初不比國內那一座大學爲輕。南通學院所在的地區，是江淮三角洲，在這個地區中間，有數百萬可耕的田畝，還滯留在人工耕種時代，需要改進；有數百里長的濱海地區，還是斥鹵不毛之地，需要繁殖。它又是一塊最標準的產棉區，而濱海地帶一經開墾，則棉產的增進，更是必然的事實，所以就紡織上說，也是一塊最理想的硏究對象。</p>
<p>重點敎育　建國儲才</p>
<p>張季直先生之創南通學院的理想，也就是希望敎育與實業配合，以開發蘇北的富源爲重心。南通學院尤其是紡科，過去有一段光榮的歷史，在今後建國的過程當中，南通學院當然還是以蘇北這塊地區建立一個學術中心爲其最高目標。這正和目前政府的大學分散，與重點敎育兩個方針相適合。</p>
<p>戰亂未　，建國艱巨。農村凋蔽，中國需要農業人材，紡織工業幼稚，　都已起，中國需要紡織人才。張淵掦校長說：「南通學院在先天上具有創辦人之創造精神與優良傳統，而瞻望未來，更有事業上之重大使命。這幾句話，正是今南通學院千百位學生的精神所寄託的地方。</p>

<h3>柏克談民主</h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>國民大會閉幕了，總統和副總統也選出來了。不管與論界對第一次大會的感想如何，形式上這是民主政治的開端。今後的問題是實質的問題，是內容的問題，也是精神的問題。什麽是民主政治的精神？怎樣才能符合這種精神？這是我們得時加討論的。英儒柏克氏（Ernest　Barker）是政治學上的權　。他對於民主政治的觀點很値得我們加以注意。</p>
<p>柏克氏認爲民主政治主要的是一種自由討論的政治。民主的本身『乃是一種自由討論觀念的性情和習慣』。沒有這種性情和習慣，便不會有民主政治。政府是自由討論的政府，人民是自由討論的人民。一切政治上的興革，都籍自由討論的方式去尋求結論。這種討論是自由的，忍耐的，也是合理的。、</p>
<p>自由討論的表現，自民主政治言，是經由政黨，選舉團，國會及內閣等政治機構而表現。這些政治機構是必要的，否則，自由討論的效力無從表現。所以柏氏說：「當一羣自由的人民，自由思索其不同的思想，自由表現在不同的政黨上，而在自由選舉的國會內自由的辯論，及在這樣的國會內，各黨各派—政府和反對派，內閣和反內閣—經過自由商談與台作而自由的妥協，這我認爲是民主政治的最高形式。」這一段話裏表現了民主政治的要件：一要有自由的人民，二要有自由的思想，三要有自由組織及自由加入的政黨，四要有自由選舉的國會，五要有自由辯論的可能。沒有這些自由，則這便不是民主政治。例如，有政黨，而政黨不始人民自由組織及自由加人的，這等於沒有政黨。或有國會，而國會不是自由選舉的，這也等於沒有國會。一切須以自由爲基礎。沒有自由，即無民主。</p>
<p>但自由討論的性情和習慣，是需要培養，需要訓練，一言以蔽之，需要敎育才能造成的。因此柏氏認爲民主政治，除了需要上述各種政治機構外也需要其他非政治性的機構。各種俱樂部，工會，社會團體，鄕村組織，敎會，學校等等，可說都是訓練人民自由討論的機關。人民自由討論的性情和習慣，必得先在這些機關內養成。敎育的一個主要目的，即在　成人民這種自由，討論的習慣。人民有了這種自由討論的習慣，然後政府可能是自由討論的政府。</p>
<p>末了，柏氏認爲民主政治是偏重手段而非偏重目的的政治。這是民主政治和獨裁政治間的主要區別。獨裁政治可說是偏重目的，是爲目的而不擇手段的政治。在實現某一目的的名義下，一切壓迫人民的手段都可採用。這樣，不管目的如何崇高，自手段言，總是獨裁的。獨裁只表現在手段上，決不表現在目的上。任何獨裁者所宣稱的目的，也就是表面上的目的（心內目的是難知的），必然是崇高的。這目的的本身必很　和民主政治所宣稱的目的有什麽區別。譬如說：謀人民的福利，這是獨裁者所喜言的。我們能說這種目的錯誤嗎？能說這種目的不也是民主政治的目的嗎？就目的論目的，我們無法區別民主和獨裁。所能區別的是手段。手段錯誤，或這種手段是獨裁的，這只能說是獨裁的政治。古代聖君賢相的政治，目的崇高，無可諱言，即實際上，對於人民，也許是有益的，也許是爲人民所謳歌的，可是手段專制，我們也只能說他是獨裁的政治。目的藉手段而實現。手段不正當，雖可實現某一目的，却也常常破壞其他的目的。古人所謂，殺一不幸，而得天下，有所不爲者，就是重視手段的意思。現代民主政治所以自別於獨裁者，也就在手段的重視上。所以柏氏認爲自由的民主政治，「乃是較注意政府的方法而不是其目的——較注意政府經歷程而不是其目標的。」</p>
<p>以上幾點是柏氏關　民主政治的意見。作者認爲這此意見是很可珍貴的。如果國家的政策，不論是內政或外交，沒有自由討論的餘地或不容許相反意見的流行，不容許反對黨提出　議，則這種政治必不是民主政治。什麽政治民主或經濟民主，這一條件不滿足，即不是民主。這是高一談民主的人所應注意的。</p>
<p>間　論之，老子之人生觀，一言以蔽之，曰明道以守道而已。物與我皆道體之著於用。物我俱出於道，其形雖異，厥體則同。形隔於時間空間，有彼此之分；道一而已，其發用流行於人物之問，超時空而　此。形者「器」也，在人之軀幹肢體，在物之塊然　然者，是已。人物所同秉於道以爲人若物者，曰「德」；德者，道之在人若物，假其軀幹肢體，及其塊然　然者，以爲器，而見其用者也。明道之功，在能破時空之限，泯人物彼己之分，通於一本之道，而識萬有之同源焉。守道之事，則本萬有之同源，各保其德，各安其分，不相侵凌殘害，以共存於運化之中。運化之中，物有成毀，人有死生，成毀死生，運化之大流中，區波之起伏耳。道之發用流行而爲運化也。常因相反相成之勢，則成毀死生，亦相反相成之事，自然而必然者也。人物之死生成毀，無害於道體之常，亦猶　波之平陂起伏，無損於海水之全。明乎此，斯生無可喜，死不足惡。不喜生惡死，則死生一矣；死生一，則立身行已，　所掛礙，樂天安命，而生暢矣。識萬有同源，泯彼己之分，保德守分，不相侵害，則人物齊矣；人物齊，則待人接物，有以相容相劑矣。立身行已樂天安命，待人接物相容相劑，斯人情洽而物理順，天下可臻於郅治焉。</p>
<p>人物死生成毀，萬化流遷不息，是道即用以爲變也。願此變動不居之中，有其不變常行少勢，則相反相成是已。相反相成之中，反者不終爲反，所反不終爲所反，互爲起伏更代；起伏更代之中，無人物事爲常住不變，常住不變者，唯道之本體，及其發用流行之途術（即相反相成之勢）耳。道之本體，及其發用流行之術，皆自然而必然，明乎是，守乎是，因乎是，則立身行己，待人接物，無所親疏愛憎，斯無所用於仁，無所利害宜否，斯無所用於義，無所貴賤厚薄，斯無所用於禮，無所造作施爲，斯無所用於智，故曰，仁義禮智，「道」「德」之　疣，守道保億者所不取也。</p>
<p>惟老子之人生觀：於立身行已，則一死生而樂天安命，故內常自足；（足於道也）而無假於外求；於待人接物，則齊人物而泯彼己之分，故智恒內斂，而鄙夷夫逐物之末學。今夫所求於外者，濟生之具耳；唯喜生惡死，乃求濟生之具；生死不喜不惡，則弗趨生避死，復何所須於濟生之具？是以不求。人皆不求濟半之具，斯天地有餘財，無所用於爭奪矣。齊人物而泯彼己，則我與人物同體，（謂，同本體）而　主客之分。我即人物，主即是客，明我之體即所以明人物之體，知主即所以知客，斯「萬物皆備於我，反身而誠」，無待於逐物以爲學，此智之所以內斂，無一所用於外溢爲也。且夫主觀客觀之分，今人所謂理智之樞紐也。主觀客觀云者，以己爲「知者」，以物爲「所知」；以知者觀所知，猶主臨客，主客判而爲二矣。老子泯人物彼己，故主客之觀不分；主客之觀不分，理智之用莫由起。由斯而言，以謂老子反今人所謂理智，無不可也。</p>
<p>雖然老子自有其智之用，　用何之？則以體認其在我之道體而已。「體認」云者，即體以明體，非以體爲「所知」而求知之也。體認，老子謂之「玄覽」。「玄」者縣也，道體之謂；道體懸不著物，著物乃分彼此，縣則一矣。即道之懸以覽道體，乃見道體爲一；見道體爲一，則破我執，我之道體同夫人物之道體矣。顧道兼體用，體以爲用，用以見體，二者相待相須，不可離也。然而體隱用顯，明道之功，唯卽用以識體耳。萬化之流遷，若人之思慮云爲，若物之動靜成毀，皆道體之發用；則明道之爲，亦唯於萬化流遷之中，騐其人物思慮云爲，動靜成毀，之迹，以見人物之同源，其思慮云爲，動靜成毀，俱此　體之發用流行也。然則體認之事實　體騐之功，騐所以爲認，認存於騐之中，認與騐，二而一，一而二也；「認」者「知」義，「　」者「行」義，於斯可見「知」「行」之合一焉。易辭言之，體騐之事唯於立身行己，待人接物，之間行之，騐之眞，然後認之審，亦即行之熟，而後知之詳，—是即用（道之用）以明體（道之體）之功也。</p>
<p>即用以明體，則體不空不寂；明體以達用，則用弗迷弗亂。體。常也，用·變也；體·靜也，用。動也。知常守靜，然後處變靡惑，應變不屈，迹變而體常，外動而內靜，身勞而心逸，修爲之功，此其至矣。故曰，老子之人生觀，一言以蔽之，明道守道而已；——明道守道，知常守靜也；知常所以應變，守靜所以御動，變得其所，動合其宜，立身行己無不貞，待人接物靡不利矣。</p>
<h3>懷黑德敎授：論中國科學</h3>
<p>— 佐禹</p>
<p>英哲懷黑德敎授（Prol.A.N.Whitehead）已于最近逝世，本刊曾有文章紀念他。他沒有到過中國，所以他在中國，不像杜威和羅　二人的知名。可是他對於中國文化卻有相當認識，尤其是對於中國科學不發達的原因，更有深刻的了解。</p>
<p>懷氏在「科學與近代世界」（Science　and　The　ModernWorld）一書上，曾提到中國文化。他說：「科學所需要的一種特殊的心靈均勢，曾在許多偉大的文化上僅偶爾不規則的發現過，且產生了極微弱的結果。例如，我們愈知道中國的藝術，中國的文學，中國的人生哲學，我們便愈崇拜這種文化所達到的高峯。數千年來在中國曾有不少思想敏銳而有學問的人們畢生致力於研究工作。以歷史的悠久，及人口的衆多言，中國構成了世界所曾見的範圍最廣的文化。我們沒有理由可以懷疑個別的中國人關於硏究科學的內在能力。可是中國科學却實際上是不足道的。我們也沒有理由可以相信，如中國任其自然，中國會產生任何科學上的進步」。在這一段話裏，　氏的啓示是，中國人有研究學問的精神，也有硏究科學的內能在力，然中國科學所以不發達，即因爲中國人缺乏科學所需要的一種心靈或心態。中國所以缺乏這種心態的原因，懷氏在另一書上，復有說明。</p>
<p>在「理性的職能」（TheFunction　of　Reason）一書上，懷氏又談到中國科學不發達的原因。他認爲科學最需要的是一種「玄想」（Specnlation）。不過，這種玄想是受方法控制的玄想，而不是不受控制的玄想。我們可以說，科學所需要的是玄想和方法，却不光是玄想。希臘人富於玄想，中國人也富於玄想。可是田希臘人的玄想，產生了科學，由中國人的玄想，不能產生科學。理由何在呢？這是因爲希臘人的玄想，受方法的控制，知道注意觀察，注意事實，因而可以產生重要的結果。反之，中國人的玄想，便不受方法的控制，其玄想猶如無　之馬，任意馳騁，結果玄想流爲幻想或空想，產生不出什麽結果來。希臘人的玄想是眞正的玄想，中國人的玄想却太半是幻想或空想。其區別在，一知注重方法，及有方法的自覺，一則不知注重方法，及沒有方法的自覺。力法是科學的要素。科學所需要的心態，就是有方法的自覺的心態。這種心態的養成，則在以方法訓練之。方法的訓練是造成科學所需要的心態的主要途徑。中國要謀科學的進步，不能不注重方法。（以上不是　氏書的原語，是作者根據懷氏之意，推演而成　）。懷氏的覲點，我想沒有人能加以否認。</p>
<p>我國傳統學者不矩注重方法，至低限度，是沒有方法的自覺。這是我國科學不發達的主因。現在我國科學家口頭上艱知道方法的重要，却並不視方　爲一門學問而加以硏究，所以理工學院中沒有方法　或　　的一門課程，作者認爲這仍是忽視方法的傳統，</p>
<h3>鮑桑克論不完善的自我</h3>
<p>— 質如</p>
<p>（二）樸素的自我，就是一個天價，簡單，而無染汙習氣的自我。他這種德性是他可以爲善的基礎，所以原則上不能說他壞，或者還可以說他是善的；但是他缺少經驗，所以沒有應世接物，而過高等文明生活的能力，這就是他底缺陷式不完善之處了。但是一個樸素的一不識不知的可能是善的，一個很有知識的心可能是惡的。所以樸素的自我可以比之一於一篇僅有基本原則而無詳明的理論，嚴整的系統，豐富的內容的文章。</p>
<p>（三）壞的自我　上兩種自我都還沒有堅定而顯明的個體性，所以與無限或絕對，或全體旣　顯著而積極的一致，也無顯明而積極的衝突；同時內部旣無和順博雅的內容，也無矛盾卑劣的機括；所以旣不能說他們完善，也不能說他們質惡。所謂壞自我便和他們不同了，因爲壞的自我可以有堅定的性格，一貫的行爲，豐富的知識，甚深的理解。單獨一的看，他是一個很完一整的個體，他自成一格，可以引起人底歎賞，他有他底理論和主張。你若承認了他底理論和主張，你也許承認他是好的。但若超出他個人底立塲，站在更高的層次，以更大的眼光去看他時，你就發見他是與全體衝突，爲人類所不能容的一個眞正的壞人了。所以壞人底壞，並非他個人毫無所長，而是他與善—全體—衝突的，不相容的。這種自我譬如一篇持之有故言之成理的文章，但不能與整個的經驗相容，所以統體是假。（續完）</p>
<h3>學林禁話　（廿二）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>西哲論華北　（中）</p>
<p>試以中國與歐洲來比較，便覺得有大相逕庭之處。中國的版圖比歐洲全洲稍大。外人之論中國者，往往忽略這一點。要知道，中國並非如歐洲的一國，而是相當於整個歐洲。中國現分三十左右省區，歐洲則分三十左右國家。他們疆塲之間，一彼一此，壁壘森嚴，糾紛時起，且經這次大戰以後而仇恨愈深。在昔羅馬帝國時，歐洲頗有統一的趨勢，但自羅馬亡後，始終未能統一，這是什麽原故呢？今日的歐洲不過是一個地理名詞，而中國乃是同一語言同一文化的同一民族。數千年來雖迭經戰亂，而中國終能憑藉其固有文化以建立一民族國家。倫敦大學敎授湯南（R.H.Fowney）有言曰，一以我遊歷所得的印象，深感覺中國不僅是一個地理單位，　有其活潑潑的國格。」中國之統一性實爲其特殊文化經過悠久發展以後的自然結果。</p>
<p>已故英國北岩勳爵（LordNorthciilf）爲倫敎泰晤士報的主人，曾發表其旅美感想有曰，「凡異國人士遊歷美國，覺其風光和風格，處處從同，從外表上觀察，幾無從分　其爲何州何城。早餐的食譜，女孩束髮的樣式，如此之類，舉國同風。人民的儀容和舉止，彼此互相酷肖。只有中國人民亦是知此一道同風。」北岩於一九二一年來游中國，曾自北平致書於其家人曰，「人人都說和日本人在一起，感覺得不舒服，可是與中國的讀書人相結識，便覺得意氣相投。這種說法我也具有同感。此由於中英兩國民性茶爲近似之故。」北岩勳爵的話，好象是老生常談，實際含有深意，因爲他所講的是多數人所知道的，所以不覺平淡無奇了。</p>
<p>在美國林肯總統任內，浦安臣（Anson　Borlingame）奉命出使中國。他在北平當了六年公使之後，以一個美國人而受中國之命、充中國聘問西洋各國的使臣。蒲氏於一八六八年抵美國，是年波士頓各界晉設宴歡迎中國使臣及其隨員。艾默生代表主人致歡迎辭，這一席話他充分發表了頃慕中國的意思？他所特別重視的一點便是敎育在中國政制上所佔的重要性。艾氏以爲孔子的人格可以作爲人類努力向上的榜樣。大人物便是能把最高尙的道德身體力行的人，而道德乃是宇宙的生命力。</p>
<p>孔學　義以修身爲至要。從自立自達去做工夫，方可達到精神上的尊嚴。哥倫比亞大學校長白特勒（Butler）曾謂「個人的身體智　與心力實爲任何眞正文化的原動力。」孔子敎育哲學的中心觀念即爲人格的完成，具有智仁勇三德者謂之君子。惟有君子方能成爲一政治家惟有君子能成爲良方善的世界公民。</p>
<p>孔子之言曰，「政者正也」，正義不但以之治國，且以之平天下。正義　是解決國內問題和國際問題的鎖　。艾默生有一次演說　　林肯總統的　放黑奴官言。他以爲林肯的作風合於孔學的大義。艾氏相信孔子學說可作爲衡量近代歷史的準繩。國父中山先生的三民主義，表面上是取材於林肯總統的葛茨堡演說實則中國民治思想在固有哲學中已有深厚的根基。目前世界大戰的狂瀾，係起因於十九世紀以來若干偏激的思想，由因推果，顯然可見。這些足以釀成戰禍的思想，我們對它的注意，應不下　戰事的本身。在我們看來，偏激的思想就是一種最厲書的武器。美　約　霍普金大學校長鮑曼（Isaiah　Bo）wman）有云，「保障世界和平之道有二，一爲人權之學說，一爲擁護正義之各國聯合力量。人類倘非力該自由，即將淪爲奴隸」。中國古來素以親仁善鄰爲立國之方針，且非爲徒託空言，而常能見諸　事。</p>

<h3>打開天窗</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>想來大家都還記得吧，在戰後不久的一個時期，上海美貨「殺到」，一磅的克寗奶粉祇售一千五百塊錢一聽，玻璃皮包，背帶，梳子，以及尼隆絲襪，都祇是幾　萬塊錢至幾百塊錢的東西，金套的派克也祗四五萬元一枝，現在三十萬元一瓶的派克墨水，那時地攤上滿坑　谷，最廉的時候僅需五六百塊錢一瓶。</p>
<p>根據那個時候一般薪給勞働者的收入言，自然不能說是頂便宜，但至少克寗奶粉與玻璃甚麼之類，尙在一般人的購買力之內。而那些略帶霉味的巧格力糖，更是阿毛阿狗人手一塊，比五百塊錢一根的廉價榨冰猶爲普遍。</p>
<p>但就在這個時期的前後，一輩所謂代表「民族資本家」的政客和經濟學者出來說話了，認爲外貨充斥，不僅消耗外匯，且將危及「民族工業」的生存。於是主張，外貨輸入應先限於本國所不能製造的生產工具與原料。結果是花旗橘子首遭開刀，繼之便是尼隆，口紅，花粉等一類的奢侈品。至於奶粉罐頭食物之類，也因受外匯的限制，秖能走入黑市途徑。</p>
<p>站在發展「民族工業」的觀點言，這一切措置自然是無可非議的，因爲國際貿易不能祗進不出，國家旣窮，而猶須消耗巨額的外匯於輸入不必要的奢侈品，無異是促民族經濟自殺。花旗橘子與克寗奶粉雖然可口而滋　，然而對於一個米麵猶須仰求外國施捨的國家，這終究不免是太那個了。</p>
<p>退而求其本，大家自然希望我們的所謂「民族資本家」與「民族工業」能利用政府限制舶來品轍入的機會，來轟轟烈烈的幹一番，至少先讓老百姓們能穿一件廉價的布衣，吃一碗廉價的米飯。說一句窮酸氣的實在話，這幾年來老百姓肚子早已餓得不剩半點油水，例如有些地方曾蒙聯總的好意去散發過奶粉，把奶粉當做熟天路上的施茶那樣供給災區的窮人，然而他們不是吃了就嘔，就是害了肚瀉（這不是筆者杜撰，「生活」雜誌上曾經刊載過這類事情的照片和文字）。這也足見我們還沒有享受如此「補品」的福氣，能有口苦飯吃吃，大家便覺得已經是犬下太平了。</p>
<p>可是最近却忽又聽見我們的「民族資本家」們躱在現在尙不能算是我們「民族」領土的香港，在大聲喊叫「民族工業」的「危機」了。不過這一次不是事關「外匯」的美國貨，而是東洋貨。據說現在的廣州市塲上，已是日貨充斥，且價格之廉，花色之多，使我們「南遷」後的「民族」資本家不得不發極喊叫了。</p>
<p>要不是由這一喊，我們還不知道所謂「民族資本家」者，已經喬遷到大英帝國殖民地的香港去了。當然，我們也曾在報紙上看到過「資金南移」的消息，但以中國之大，早已有人把我們的國家　分成「華北」，「華中」，一華南」等區域，所以資金南遷，本也無所謂。不過香港雖也屬於「華南」，究竟還說不上是「民族」的，則「民族」資本之南遷，究竟有幾分是爲「民族工業」打算，就是我不說，大家也是明白的。</p>
<p>略懂些經濟學的人，當然知道資本主義這個東西，在其發展的某一階段，確是具有十分濃厚的民族色彩的，不過時至今日，「利之所趨」，便是「資本主義」的同義語。爲了追求利用，民族不民族早不在考慮之下了。打開大窗說句亮話，現在市塲上充斥的黑市美貨，以及大規模的日貨走私，要不是擁有雄厚資本的實力者，就誰也不能幹這一手。因爲走私的利用人盡皆知遠超過正當生產事業的利益，所謂民族資本的南遷，究其實，又豈非爲的是那邊走私方便？</p>
<p>書至此，我不禁對那一千五百塊錢一聽克寗奶粉的時代神往，對那「民族」工業的危機呼聲，祗有冷笑的份兒！如果沒有便宜的布穿，便宜的東西吃，我又何愛於在外國殖民地上高喊「民族工業」危機的「民族資本家」哉！</p>
<h3>名人與狀</h3>
<p>— 玎玲</p>
<p>大詩人彌爾頓愛在床上苦吟成篇，一到黃昏便上床作詩。後來雙目全盲，每晚八時進晚餐後，吸一會烟，喝一杯開水就去睡了。睡在床上，詩興大發，由他的女兒或書記筆錄他的口述，就這樣完成了偉大的「失樂園」。</p>
<p>英哲學家與算學家何勃，一生時光大半在床上消磨。他喜歡在潔白的被褥上畫滿數學圖綫，否則不能工作，且不能入睡。</p>
<p>法國哲學家狄卡爾因身體孱弱，在床上消磨了不少時光，在床上窮思極想，完成了不朽的傑作。</p>
<p>伏爾泰的辛辣的文章，表現他超人的心智，而他的大作也是從床上培植出來的·他睡時文思潮湧，完成腹稿，翌日一早便記述下來。</p>
<p>英國文壇怪傑約翰生博士一生　　，雖　次想改而未果·</p>
<p>路易十六在短短一生中睡過四百一十三張床。</p>
<p>狄更司睡的床舖一定要朝北方才認爲合意，所以當他不在家睡覺時，身邊總帶着一副指南針，以便安排鋪位。</p>
<h3>穴居的羅馬</h3>
<p>— 章礝石</p>
<p>羅馬人民因爲缺乏住屋，現在他們都在度着「穴居野宿」的太古時代的生活。</p>
<p>意大利在大戰的時候，所遭到的損失相當嚴重，難民們爲了謀生，他們便聚集到羅馬去。大戰結束之後，退伍軍人紛紛歸家，當局沒有能力去安排他們，他們爲了要生存，於是有很多都落草爲　。比較有智識的就紛紛另找職業。</p>
<p>因爲整個的意大利在遭受着苦難的打擊，所以他們的出路都很狹窄。於是那些一時找不到正當職業的人，便一擁而至羅馬，經營着投機事業，</p>
<p>現在羅馬的人口已倍於戰前，而住屋却是有限。於是地窖，防空洞，屋簷下，大樹邊，乾枯的河牀，紀念塔，牌坊脚下等，就成了臨時的住所。</p>
<p>可是，富有的人們呢？他們却在房荒聲中依然住得很適意，有公寓，有別墅，有花園，衛生設備一應俱全。</p>
<p>就依住屋的情形看，羅馬地方是天堂，却也是地獄。</p>
<h3>張南皮一怒斃婦之謎</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>予　著人物品　　錄一書，曾記：「南皮張之洞與婦伉儷素篤，旣生子矣，某晚，忽因小兒事，互起爭執，南皮一時憤怒，失足將婦踢倒，急行扶起，已人事不知，鼻中流血不止，迨延醫診治，已屬不及，翌日殞命，乃買棺安殮，一切如禮、運柩回里。其內兄子祥，欲興問罪之師，幸子祥乃南皮尊人之及門弟子？碍於老師情面，未便生波折，乃以葬禮必須從豐爲要求，南皮尊人允之，始未成訟，然南皮不敢回家者年餘，蓋甚愧對子祥也。旣而南皮尊人又爲南皮定婚高氏，以備　娶，南皮猶以爲於心未安，調此雖與例無禁，於理無傷，而於必情則似乎難言，乃展緩至三年後，始成嘉禮，且時時懷念前婦，久未釋懷云。」南社名宿景梅九見拙作，謂確有其事，且吿南皮官山西，一日親審某案，主犯爲一婦人，甫上堂，南皮猝然昏倒，吏卒大驚，急扶之入內，經時始醒，蓋主犯婦人，面貌絕類其被斃之婦，南皮神經遽受刺激，不覺身不由主而傾仆焉。不意頃接廣州江世堯來函，有云：「先生博聞强識，目解高超，素所心折，大著人物品藻錄，珍奇可貴，確可供史乘之采，惟記述旣多，難免無一二傳聞失實之處。如書內張南皮一怒斃婦文，疑非事實。僕於近百年來中國各方面略有建樹之人物，極喜硏求其生平事跡，故右關人物之傳記年譜等書，收藏頗多，査張文襄於咸豐四年娶妻石氏，咸豐六年，文襄尊翁張鍈病逝貴陽，同年，其內兄石均殉都勻之雖。同治四年，其妻石氏病逝京師，是年文襄散館，列一等一名，同治六年，充浙江鄉試副考官。文襄於妻石氏逝後，繼娶唐，並無與高氏女婚娶之事，大作云南皮斃其婦後，其內兄欲興問罪之師，爲南皮尊人婉阻，南皮家　有設無大人庇蔭，則兒此刻或縲絏加身，安得此衡文秉學，進退人才云云，按諸年月，均不符合：（一）南皮第一位夫人石氏，浙於其父及其內兄後十年；（二）南皮於其父逝世後，始充浙江考官，烏能於家　中有秉學衡文進退人才等語。凡此都可證此事之子虛。先生得他人之傳聞，一時未及檢考南皮年譜傳記，致有此誤，然無碍於先生之廣　也。」按予曾見坊間出版之張之　家書，禀其父云云，皆家書中所詳載，非子虛構，然江君根據年譜傳記，亦屬可靠，則一虛一實，二者必居一於其間，豈坊間出版之張之洞家書爲　鼎耶？殊覺令人懵然不解也。</p>
<h3>花間小語</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>煮鶴焚琴，古謂殺風景之事，面松間喝道，花下晒褌，同樣使人難堪！今試涉足公園，每見蔗渣滿地，觸目刺心，亦殊使人不耐也。宋若齋居士堂疏「花宜稱」，「花憎嫉」，「花榮寵」，「花屈辱」四事，總五十八條，揭之堂上，使來者有所警省，護花心情，溢於毫素，誠所謂雅人深致者矣。</p>
<p>夫花以天時人事之培護，愈極其妍，亦以主人好事，名筆傳神益增其寵，「宜稱」「榮寵」二事，茲不且錄；獨將「花憎嫉」與「花屈辱」各條表而出之，俾世之傖夫與所謂「雅得俗」之君子，知所警省焉·</p>
<p>（一）「花憎嫉」：在風，連雨，烈日，苦寒，醜婦，俗子，老鴉，惡詩，談時事，論差除，花徑喝道，對花張緋冪，賞花動鼓板，作詩用調羹驛使事。</p>
<p>（二）「花屈辱」：俗徒　折，主人慳鄙，種富家園內與　　命名，蟠結作屛，賞花草命猥妓，庸僧窗下種，酒食店插瓶，樹下有狗屎，枝上晒衣裳，靑紙屛粉畫，生猥巷　溝邊。</p>
<p>晚近科學發達，園　進歩，人力可奪天工，巧思爭衡　物，在風，連雨，烈日，苦寒，類皆可以人工方法使之避免，惟轉移自然之環境易，而醫治人類之庸俗難辦，可嘆也。</p>
<h3>裝飾誌</h3>
<p>— 奔天</p>
<p>遠在三千年以前，埃及女　已經在刻意打扮了。有人在金字塔內發掘出一個靑綠色的孔雀型石墜，和一只緊閉着的串金綫小篋，這些都是古代蘇勃特王后　物。手篋僅二寸餘長，裏面藏有一只小匙，犬概是掬胭脂用的，還有一對細巧的拔毛鉗，用以去除眉毛。</p>
<p>在非洲，各部落裝飾不同。弗拉塔族女子用花葉子包裹手指和足趾，造成美麗耀目的紫色。又將頭　染成藍色，把牙齒　成藍，黃，紫各色，用銻的硫化物塗眼皮。</p>
<p>荷托克族女子，爲了要使他們的男人認爲美麗起見，用奶油，煤油和一種有氣味的樹葉遍塗其身，造成一種奇怪的氣味和奇異的顏色來吸引男人。</p>
<p>菲洲土人頗喜文身，他們把身上劃成鱗痕，用泥土塞入傷痕中，形成高出的疤瘢，以爲美麗。亦有土人以白漆遍　其身，來顯托皮膚的棕黑色。更有以羚羊血漆身體，於頭髮上佈滿雲母粉，以爲裝飾的。</p>
<p>在澳洲某一區域，祗有男子可用化粧品，婦女祗准裝飾面部，否則就是犯法。武士們將紅，黃，白，藍各色染料裝飾其皮膚，故商人以高價出售顏料，可獲巨利。相反的，在紐西蘭，化粧品是女人的專用品，鼻上都染有色素。</p>
<p>在南洋島嶼上的土人，用人骨磨尖的針在人身上刺出各種花紋，以椰子灰與水混合成的藍色顏料嵌入皮膚中，常有人因忍受不了這慘無人道的彫刺，竟致死去。在墨西哥土人中，文身亦頗流行，此外他們有的還將牙齒銼成尖形，有的則鑽進去，塡入一片翡翠和絲寳石。</p>

<h3>President Sun's Remarks: Hoping for the Participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] Sun Ke, who served as President of the Legislative Yuan for 16 years, was re-elected as the first President of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution on the 17th with the largest number of votes. This reporter recently visited Mr. Sun and asked him to express his feelings about being elected President of the Legislative Yuan. Mr. Sun said: "The Legislative Yuan was an institution that practiced democratic politics in the past, and it will follow this path in the future. Everything will be decided after discussion at the meeting." Mr. Sun's attitude and expression were very calm when he spoke. The reporter then asked him about his opinions on the participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties in the Legislative Yuan and the future new cabinet. Mr. Sun said: "If we look at the politics of European and American countries, there are many examples of minority parties occupying a very small position in the group. The determination of political views is not determined by the number of people. Especially the number of Democratic and Youth Parties in the Legislative Yuan, even if we talk about the original negotiated number, is not a majority. Furthermore, if we increase it to 200 or 300, it is still not a majority when voting. But if one person participates, his opinion can still be expressed." Mr. Sun expressed his hope that the two parties can participate in the Legislative Yuan immediately. Finally, the reporter asked about the organization of the National Construction Society hosted by Mr. Sun. He said: "It is being actively prepared and will be formally established soon."</p>
<h3>Vice President Chen Expresses Pleasure About Being Elected</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] After Chen Lifu was elected Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, he spoke to the surrounding Chinese and foreign reporters in the auditorium at the end of the meeting. "I am very happy that I was elected with more than half of the votes in the election of the Vice President. I had no intention of running for Vice President in the past. Since the party has proposed it, I can only obey the party's decision. Some people have attacked me. For the sake of the party's unity, I am not willing to argue too much, because the party's unity is more important than voting, and the voting issue cannot affect unity." The reporter asked whether Mr. Wai Da was planning to go abroad after being elected Vice President. Mr. Chen replied: "Before I had a position, it was very free to go abroad or not. Now that I have been elected Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, I must first obtain the government's approval to go abroad." The reporter then asked if he had plans to go abroad before the election. Mr. Chen smiled and said: "I didn't even plan to run for election at first, so naturally I didn't plan to be elected or go abroad after being elected." After being elected, Mr. Chen went to the stage to shake hands with the temporary chairman Wu Tiecheng. Some legislators in the waiting area surrounded Mr. Chen and congratulated him. Mr. Chen also expressed his gratitude for the support of the legislators.</p>

<h3>Chairman and Wife Tour Taihu Lake; Enjoying the Beautiful Scenery and Appearing Very Content; Particularly Concerned About the Rising Prices in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 17th] The Chairman and his wife temporarily resided in the Liyuan Lakeside Villa in the suburbs on the evening of the 16th. They got up at dawn on the 17th and strolled through the gardens, enjoying the natural scenery. After a while, they had breakfast with their wife and read the Kyoto-Shanghai newspapers of the day. At 10:15, they took the "Pingxiang" yacht with their wife to cruise Taihu Lake. The minesweeper was towed by the "Xiangsheng" wheel, and the gunboat "Minghu" led the way in front. The attendants took another "Pingzong" steamboat and waited behind. The four ships were lined up in a row and slowly moved east. The weather was clear today and the lake was pleasant. After arriving at Hengyun Mountain, they abandoned the boat and climbed the mountain, walking very vigorously, straight to the Xuelang Temple and Jiangzi Pavilion on the top of the mountain. Jiangzi Pavilion is the study of Song Xiangxian Jiang Yimei. The Chairman lingered in front of the pavilion for a long time, appearing very content. The old farmer in charge of the pavilion offered fragrant tea. After gazing for a while, he changed to a rattan sedan chair and went down the mountain to return to the boat, and then wandered on the lake, enjoying the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains. He had lunch at Zhongdu Mountain Lake. At 2:40 pm, he returned to the Lakeside Villa. The nearby people heard that the Chairman had returned from a lake tour and gathered on the opposite bank across the river, wanting to see the Chairman and his wife's demeanor. The Chairman heard the report and ordered the boat to dock at the dock on the right side of the gate. He abandoned the boat and landed, nodding to the people on the opposite bank. Mrs. Chiang led the way, and the Chairman entered the gate of the Lakeside Villa to rest. The people on the opposite bank, feeling the Chairman's amiable expression, waited until late without dispersing. Last night, the Chairman and his wife lived in the Turtle Garden Lakeside Villa. Because the house was not connected to electricity in the urban area, it generated its own electricity, but the sound of the engine was disturbing and they could not sleep well. The Chairman felt that it was a pity that such a quiet and peaceful scenic area was disturbed by the noisy engine sound. He had ordered the local government to find a way to repair the circuit between the area and the urban area as soon as possible. Today, a small generator has been moved from Qitingyan, which can supply hundreds of lights. The sound of the engine is no longer disturbing. It is expected that the Chairman and his wife will be able to get a full rest tonight. Today is the late spring weather, and there is still a chill on the lake. When traveling, the Chairman wore a long robe and a black cloak, while his wife wore a western-style suit and trousers, a black spring coat, and a large straw hat woven with white grass. After visiting the scenic spots of Toutouzhu and Dushan, they returned at dusk at 8:00 pm. Also, when the Chairman went out at 5:00 pm, the Jiangsu Provincial Tenant Association sent many representatives to wait at the gate of the villa, wanting to petition the Chairman. Later, the representative Mao Fengming conveyed the intention to Deputy Adjutant Liu before leaving. Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, arrived in Xi at noon at 12:00 on the Qiantang ship this morning to meet with the Chairman. He resigned after a brief conversation. Tonight, the Chairman and his wife will still stay overnight in Wuxi and will return to the capital before the presidential inauguration ceremony on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 17th] After returning to Liyuan at 2:40 pm on the 17th, the Chairman received Wang Gong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, Xu Yuanruo, Magistrate of Wuxi County, Li Tiping, Speaker of the County Council, Peng, Chief of Staff of the Kyoto-Shanghai Garrison Command Wuxi Command Post, and the team leader of the 1st Gendarmerie Team during the break. The Chairman immediately inquired in detail about the situation of public security, agriculture, industry and commerce in Wuxi. At the same time, he was very concerned about the fact that the prices in Wuxi were even higher than those in Kyoto and Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 17th] After arriving at Dushan at 5:50 pm, the Chairman and his wife walked up to Wan'an Chan Temple. Magistrate Xu followed. The Chairman turned his head from time to time and told him that the scenic area of Yingshan should be cultivated more, especially afforestation, and hoped that local gentry and wealthy households could donate money to launch this work. In addition, he revisited the trees that Ai Dan planted in the abbot of Chan Temple. Afterwards, he and his wife and attendants walked around the mountain for a week and returned by boat, boating on Taihu Lake. As the sun was setting in the west, the blue waves were like a mirror. The Chairman frequently held on to the railings and looked into the distance, showing his gentle and pleasant smile from time to time, appreciating the surrounding lake and mountain scenery until he returned in the evening. Also, when the Chairman went out at 5:00 pm, the Jiangsu Provincial Tenant Association sent many representatives to wait at the gate of the villa, wanting to petition the Chairman. Later, the representative Mao Fengming conveyed the intention to Deputy Adjutant Liu before leaving. Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, arrived in Xi at noon at 12:00 on the Qiantang ship this morning to meet with the Chairman. He resigned after a brief conversation.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Commodity Prices Requires First Stabilizing Finance</h3>
<p>Due to the sudden tightening of credit in the last four days of last week, commodity prices in the city have gradually fallen. Taking major commodities such as rice, oil, sugar, yarn, cloth, and soap as examples, except for the rice price which fell only slightly, the market price on the 15th was 10% to 20% lower than on the 11th. However, yesterday, the foreign exchange rate suddenly became restless, rising by 46%, with the US dollar at 474,000 yuan, a rise of 150,000 yuan; the British pound at 1,420,000 yuan, a rise of 450,000 yuan; and the Hong Kong dollar at 88,504 yuan, a rise of 28,007 yuan. Commodity prices have stabilized slightly, but finance has become unstable again. Therefore, regardless of whether commodity prices can continue to fall in the future, or how long this weak trend can last, if suppressing commodity prices relies solely on these sudden measures such as tightening credit and suppressing the securities market, without considering fundamental solutions such as restricting issuance, guiding floating capital, stabilizing foreign exchange, and supporting production, then we feel that it is not normal and not thorough enough.</p>
<p>The reason for this is very simple. After credit is tightened, if it can be held firmly without being released, so that the market can maintain a considerable state of stability, then under the condition of no (other) new factors, the rising trend of commodity prices may not reignite. If it is erratic, tight at times and loose at others, then the effectiveness of the temporary tightening may not be fully effective.</p>
<p>Although the restrictions on domestic remittances and cash transport have not been relaxed, the amount of floating capital flowing into Shanghai from various places through private smuggling and material movement is still quite considerable. Since the Northeast circulating currency was allowed to circulate, the banditry in North China and Central China has intensified, and the price increases in South China, due to excessive currency in circulation, have even exceeded Shanghai, resulting in a reverse flow of funds. Under this situation, even if the recovered legal currency is not released again and no new legal currency is issued, the credit in this city may not be able to remain tight for long; moreover, this minimum hope may not be realized in fact.</p>
<p>The most important condition for the development of industry and commerce is stability, and financial stability is particularly the pivot for promoting development. Because if financing, interest rates, and exchange rates change (missing character) frequently and unpredictably, then all initial gains and losses will be impossible to calculate, and one will only be running around trying to cope with daily difficulties, and there will naturally be no talk of development. If handled improperly and turnover is inflexible, then a single spark can start a prairie fire, and there is even the possibility of causing major or minor storms. Therefore, the sole function of the financial authorities lies in quietly observing the situation in advance, appropriately adjusting surpluses and deficits, in order to seek stability in the market. There is absolutely no reason to go against this, deliberately causing fluctuations in the financial market or even creating unrest.</p>
<p>The so-called tightening of credit is intended to suppress commodity prices, and it can also be said to be striving for stability. However, before the rise, there was no learning from the past to gradually contract as a precautionary measure, but only afterwards, rushing to make amends, implementing sudden attacks, making many industrialists and merchants caught off guard, all falling into a very difficult situation. Is this (missing character) a legitimate way to protect industry and commerce? Moreover, this kind of method has been tried repeatedly before, and it has not been able to stabilize commodity prices effectively. The issuance of short-term treasury bills was originally said to be an effective way to absorb floating capital and suppress commodity prices, but it was not used fully after assessing the situation, and it still relied on this sudden method to inflict a painful blow after the rising trend became unusually fierce; although this is indeed a gratifying move in combating speculation and (missing character) hoarding, the price is too high in the overall economic picture.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not trying to defend the unscrupulous merchants who stir up trouble and raise prices, but we also do not want to see legitimate industry and commerce repeatedly enduring artificial pain under this kind of blitzkrieg approach, thereby deepening their crisis. In other words, suppressing commodity prices is the heart of the people, and tightening credit is also (missing character) reasonable. However, the abundance of floating capital has been around for a long time, and it is not a sudden acute illness, nor can it be cured by temporary (missing character) measures. If the authorities are truly considering earning floating capital and suppressing commodity prices, they should set a course and work continuously from multiple directions; after the rising trend has begun, they should not stand by and let it surge endlessly, and in relatively moderate periods, they should also remove the fuel from under the cauldron and treat both the symptoms and the root causes, in order to avoid accumulation and flooding, making it impossible to control once it breaks out.</p>
<p>After a big rise, there will inevitably be a small correction. The rising trend has subsided slightly in the past few days, and those who tighten credit may be complacent, thinking that they have achieved immediate success. However, we believe that the general legitimate industrialists and merchants are bearing too heavy a burden, and judging from the precedents of the past few times, the so-called (missing character)-style tightening of credit has limited effectiveness. Therefore, we hope that they will go further and take sustained and planned measures, so as not to allow the rising trend and the blitzkrieg to recur, (missing character) the vitality of the industrial and commercial sector.</p>
<p>Now, actual sales still (missing character) move slowly, and in many (missing character) in the interior, commodity prices are still behind those in this city. In this city, many wholesale merchants are also far behind the factory prices, which proves that the recent May rising trend is indeed causally related to the loose credit. Therefore, stabilizing finance should be a major prerequisite for stabilizing commodity prices. However, a short-term, occasional, and sudden tightening is more of a disturbance than a real stabilization, not to mention the stimulus of another rise in the foreign exchange rate when commodity prices have slightly subsided and become relatively stable.</p>

In the 36th fiscal year, the surplus paid to the treasury was more than 1.1 billion yuan, accounting for 25% of the provincial treasury's revenue. This year, it is estimated that 2 billion yuan will be paid, and there is confidence in achieving this goal. This year's production is 3.2 billion cigarettes, 600,000 kilograms of shredded tobacco, 240,000 cigars, and more than 410,000 hectoliters of wine. The area planted with tobacco leaves is more than 5,500 mu. Cai did not mention that the distribution targets were resellers, resulting in price gouging and excessive profits, and the people were unable to benefit. The bureau is currently working to prevent this.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] According to the regulations of the Cocoon Collection Coordination Association and the Senate this spring, cooperative cocoon drying centers are only allowed to purchase cocoons from members. Non-member cocoons should be sold to cocoon trading companies established by silk merchants, taking into account both parties' interests, which is quite fair. There are two cocoon trading companies in Xieqiao Town, this county. Minsheng Xingji in the eastern market belongs to the cooperative cocoon drying center. Jinglun in the western market has signed a contract with Fuhua Company to collect cocoons. Unexpectedly, in this assessment, both trading companies were assigned to the cooperative cocoon drying center. The company had no choice but to terminate the contract and give up. When silkworm farmers heard about this, public sentiment was in an uproar. The Xieqiao area is vast and rich in silk production. If all cocoon trading companies in the town are monopolized by the cooperative cocoon drying center, it would not only have the suspicion of manipulation, but also the number of cocoons produced by non-member silkworm farmers in this vast area is several times more than that produced by members. With no way to sell their cocoons, they are very indignant. It is reported that local gentry and township chiefs have jointly petitioned the competent authorities to assign Jinglun back to the silk factory to collect cocoons, so that large-scale production can have an outlet, and to prevent high-quality silkworm cocoons from flowing into native silk, which violates the government's overall plan to improve silk. It is hoped that the主管者 will consider the facts, adopt public opinion, and avoid causing major disputes.</p>

<h3>The Throne of the North China Cement Industry</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Li Shaolin</p>
<p>Recent Appearance of the Qixin Cement Company's Tangshan Factory</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin Air Mail] Recently, I had the opportunity to go to Tangshan and was able to visit the Qixin Cement Company's Tangshan factory, the largest cement industry in North China. This large-scale cement industry, which employs more than 3,000 workers, currently produces 500 tons per day, and the maximum production can reach 1,000 tons. The war has hindered construction, and cement has no use. There is no large sales market in North China. Although there is considerable demand in South China, there are insurmountable transportation difficulties. Various factors have caused a reduction in the production of this basic construction industry. This phenomenon is now widely reflected in light and heavy industries across the country and is an unparalleled tragedy. The people in charge of Qixin, like the directors of other industries, urgently call for stability. At the Qixin factory, there are now more than 20,000 tons of finished cement and more than 100,000 tons of clinker that has been fired and is waiting to be ground, with a total value of more than 1.2 trillion yuan at current prices. The accumulation of such a large amount of finished product is constantly increasing the difficulty of capital turnover. Recently, they have been working hard to expand the</p>
<p>Southeast Asian Market</p>
<p>hoping to find a way out.</p>
<p>The appearance of the cement industry in Tangshan dates back to the 15th year of Guangxu's reign. At that time, Tang Jingxing, a Cantonese, first established the Cement Factory in the area. The equipment was simple, and the technology was poor. What was especially unbelievable was that the limestone needed to make cement was transported from Guangdong. Due to high costs and poor sales, the Cement Factory closed in the 19th year of Guangxu's reign. In the 26th year of Guangxu's reign, Zhou Zhide reopened the factory and hired the German, Kunde, as the engineer. Kunde discovered that the stone mountain near the factory was entirely cement raw material, limestone. However, the factory encountered the Boxer Rebellion shortly after its opening and was suspended again. After the rebellion, the restoration continued, and in the 32nd year of Guangxu's reign, it was formally registered as the Tangshan Qixin Cement Company. In the 33rd year of Guangxu's reign, it was renamed Qixin Cement Co., Ltd. and has remained so until now. The stone mountain discovered by Kunde has been constantly excavated for decades. The stone mountain has been excavated from top to bottom into a chasm, and it is still the source of Qixin Cement.</p>
<p>The main raw material for making cement is limestone. It is also necessary to add red soil, yellow sand, and iron ore. Their composition must be tested and appropriately proportioned.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process</p>
<p>is not very complicated. The first step is to mix limestone, red soil or yellow sand, and iron ore and grind them. The next step is to send them to a kiln with a temperature of 1,400 degrees Celsius for heating. The final step is to mix the fired clinker with an appropriate amount of gypsum (30% to 35%), then add water and grind it into powder at a temperature below 100 degrees Celsius, which becomes widely used cement. In this industry, the technology is entirely controlled by chemical composition, and gypsum is a large consumption item. Every 500 tons of cement requires about 175 tons of gypsum. Before the war, most of the gypsum used by Qixin was purchased from Taicheng. Later, it was also purchased from Gucheng, Hubei. Now that transportation is blocked, domestic purchases cannot be made in large quantities and are almost entirely dependent on foreign countries. Qixin's raw materials and fuel supply have</p>
<p>great advantages.</p>
<p>With its own coal mine, there is never a problem with fuel. As for the main raw material, limestone, the production area is less than one mile from the factory. There is a small railway with a gauge of 18 inches running directly from the stone mountain to the factory. It is built entirely using the slope of the mountain. Empty trucks are pulled by mules and horses on the way to the mountain. Returning trucks carrying raw materials into the factory do not require any power. The first step in the factory's equipment is a powerful steel mill, which grinds the raw materials into fine powder. Next, they enter the mixing plant for blending and are then sent to a rotary kiln for heating. In the 1,400-degree rotary kiln, they are heated for 40 minutes to become gray clinker. The clinker is mixed with gypsum and then ground in a steel mill to become the finished cement. From stone grinding to finished product storage, it is a complete set of continuous equipment. The rotary kiln is the most important piece of equipment. Coal powder burns in the center, and stone powder moves around the outside for baking. The time taken from entry to exit is exactly the time required for baking. Qixin now has eight rotary kilns. The largest one produces 250 tons per day and is made in the United States. The smallest one produces 80 tons per day and was self-built by Qixin's repair shop.</p>
<p>In addition to Qixin, the cement industry in North China also includes the North China Cement Company and the Taiyuan Northwest Cement Company. There are also factories in Northeast China. Now, the products of the Northwest Company cannot be exported. The North China Cement Company and the Northeast factory have stopped operating under the threat of artillery fire. Only Qixin can maintain</p>
<p>continuous production</p>
<p>and is now struggling in hardship. The prosperity of the past is like a dream. Qingdao Wharf, the Jinpu Railway Yellow River Bridge, the Huai River Bridge, the Guangzhou Haizhu Bridge, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Nanjing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, and the Central Stadium were all built with Qixin cement before the war. Today, it is difficult to smell the atmosphere of large-scale construction. This oldest and largest national industry is facing the danger of paralysis.</p>
<p>During the wartime rear, due to the lack of cement, a cement factory using gray soil instead of cement was established in Sichuan. At that time, the output was 100 barrels per day, which was regarded as a treasure. Today, this massive cement industry is being ridiculed by the turmoil of war. Is this not an irony to the nation?</p>

<h3>The Japanese Government Formally Announces a Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan; Increase Production to Reach Pre-War Levels; Kratt Advocates Supporting Japan so it Can Be Self-Sufficient</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Radio: Kratt stated on the 17th in a speech to the World Association that if the United States does not indefinitely aid Japan, then it should endorse Japan's economic recovery plan to enable Japan to achieve self-sufficiency. Kratt demanded an immediate resolution of the reparations issue and an increase in Japanese exports to at least 1.4 billion yuan annually to pay for food and raw materials. He stated that otherwise, the United States must pay 400 million yuan annually to cover the occupation and supply the Japanese with food. Kratt also said that if the Far East is to prosper, the hatred and animosity caused by Japan's brutal war must be gradually abandoned. In Europe, the idea of forgiving former enemies is gradually gaining ground, and western Germany has been regarded by the countries participating in the European Recovery Plan as an integral part that should not be ignored. Kratt strongly argued that the reparations issue must be resolved quickly so that the Japanese can have something to follow.</p>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese government has just announced a five-year plan for economic recovery drafted by the Economic Stabilization Board, which aims to restore Japan's economy to pre-war levels by 1952. The plan emphasizes that Japan's economic recovery depends on the assistance of foreign capital. The current inflation will be reduced during the first half of the five-year plan without threatening economic stability. It further recognizes that Japan's current crisis is deep-rooted and not merely a superficial phenomenon. The plan's goals for stabilizing the economy are: (1) to provide the people with a reasonable standard of living, without worrying about the shortage of daily necessities; (2) Japan's exports are sufficient to cover its imports; and (3) the efficiency and productivity of labor are significantly improved. The plan also estimates that Japan's population will reach approximately 83 million by 1952. The plan also states that the factors limiting Japan's economic recovery are: (1) the supply of fuel and electricity; (2) the import of raw materials; and (3) the lack of transportation tools.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese government this morning released a draft of a five-year plan carefully formulated by officials of the Economic Stabilization Board over the past nine months. The main purpose of this plan is to restore Japanese industry to pre-war levels and the standard of living to 1934 levels. According to this plan, it is expected that exports will increase nine times by 1952, mining and manufacturing production will increase three times, and labor productivity and national income will double. Compared to the levels of the 1930-34 period, the mining and manufacturing figures will increase to 130% instead of 100%. In other words, coal production will reach 44 million tons instead of 31 million tons, group steel will be 3.14 million tons instead of 2,722,200 tons, ordinary steel will be 2.3 million tons instead of 2,195,000 tons, and cotton yarn value will be 990 million U.S. dollars instead of 1,157 million U.S. dollars. Annual exports will reach US$1,646 million, and annual imports will also reach the same figure as imports. Regarding the standard of living, the estimated food consumption unit will reach 2,111 calories per day, calculated in calories, while the pre-war figure was 2,242 calories. The main form of this five-year plan focuses on the entry of foreign capital. According to well-informed sources, the initial draft of this plan intended to import 1.6 billion U.S. dollars from the United States, but the occupation forces ordered that this huge figure should not be mentioned in the plan for fear that American public opinion would have an unfavorable reaction to it.</p>

<h3>US Policy Toward the Soviet Union Aims for a Balance of Power in Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] According to authoritative sources, the United States will continue to keep the "Open Door" that was closed to the Soviet Union last week closed until Europe restores its balance of power. The current period of excitement has passed, and US-Soviet "peace" talks have also disappeared. The following factors will become the focus of attention:</p>
<p>(1) The United States does not currently intend to engage in any negotiations with the Soviet Union to end the "Cold War," nor does it intend to do so for some time. (2) A balance of power in Europe cannot be restored until Western Europe is economically and politically stable, and economic and political stability requires the long-term implementation of the Marshall Plan. (3) Any negotiations with the Soviet Union at this time would only reveal that the Soviet Union holds the most power, and this is a sign of the dominance of power politics. (4) The Western powers have currently abandoned the hope of establishing a world governing body based on the principle of collective security and are eager to restore what they call a "balance of power," which in reality means the dominance of Western forces.</p>
<h3>French President Discusses the International Situation, Emphasizing Peace, Not Empty Words</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] French President Auriol delivered a speech today at the wine festival in Mâcon, Burgundy, calling on responsible politicians to hold frank talks to stop discussions on procedures. Cunning diplomatic notes and backstabbing, he said, have not benefited anyone's reputation or power and are particularly detrimental to peace. The sincerity of words must be measured by actions, and the best way to test the loyalty of a partner is to pay attention to whether their words and actions are consistent. Declarations of peace without concrete proposals have made people feel tired, and the terror of force continues to exist. All actions seem to be approaching the terrible danger of war. Now is the time to restore the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. Auriol, referring to the recent exchange of letters between the United States and the Soviet Union on the situation, expressed the hope that this opportunity would prove the joy felt by the people. Referring to the Western Alliance, he said that this is a major step in establishing an orderly, free, prosperous, and secure small island.

<p>[Reuters, [City Unknown] 16th] As Soviet newspapers discuss US-Soviet relations, they welcome several suggestions made by US Third Party presidential candidate Wallace in his open letter to Stalin last week, considering Wallace's suggestions to be practical and appropriate, showing his sincerity in seeking ways to resolve differences between the two countries. The Soviet newspapers expressed approval of several points suggested by Wallace, including general disarmament, banning weapons with group destructive power, banning any country from exporting weapons to any other country, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, abandonment of military bases in other countries, withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, non-interference in China's internal affairs, increased trade, development of cultural relations, and establishment of international relief organizations. [Newspaper Name]'s commentary quoted Stalin's recent statement, "The Soviet Union and the United States can certainly cooperate with each other. If these two systems can cooperate during wartime, why can't they cooperate during peacetime?" Recently, peace remarks made by representatives of the US government have taken a pessimistic tone when assessing the international situation, thus creating a sense of war among the American people, and the international situation is deteriorating. Wallace has made other suggestions, asking the United States to restore Roosevelt's policies, and his strength comes from this. Experience shows that during the Roosevelt era, the differences between the anti-Hitler powers could be easily resolved. Wallace's concrete suggestions do not contradict the official statements of the US and Soviet government representatives, but the actions of the US government representatives repeatedly deviate from their words. The so-called resolute diplomacy of US diplomats and the so-called Cold War of newspapers are intended to force the Soviet Union to accept the United States' views on all issues. In fact, these methods cannot have any results. However, we cannot agree with Wallace's statement that the publication of the Smith-Molotov exchange of letters is a major blow to the propagandists on both the US and Soviet sides who believe that the US and the Soviet Union cannot coexist peacefully, because there have never been and will never be such propagandists in the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Hope Major Powers Cooperate Sincerely to Eliminate the Crisis of War; British Secretary of War Issues an Appeal at the Labour Party Annual Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Scarborough, Yorkshire, 17th] The National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party held its annual conference here today, attended by more than 1,100 delegates, which is said to be the largest gathering in history. Prime Minister Attlee, Morrison, and other leaders were present. Secretary of War Shinwell, in his capacity as national chairman, delivered a speech stating that although all countries are tired of war, a new war may come. "The current suspicions and misunderstandings are multifaceted, and we must eliminate this crisis in time."</p>
<p>Shinwell said that it is unfortunate to hear people talk about another world war in three years. "We should declare clearly to people at home and abroad that we, as part of the labor and social movement, do not want another war. However, goodwill is not one-sided. We hope that others, that is, the veteran allies of wartime, can cooperate closely on the basis of mutual respect and tolerance." He refuted the argument that US aid would turn Europe into a slave of the United States. He said that in terms of domestic policy: (1) We cannot return to unlimited free enterprise. (2) The Labour Party does not intend to form an emergency coalition cabinet with the Conservative Party, because "We do not want to be the advisors of the Conservative Party and please the reactionaries who oppose socialism." (3) Industrial equipment should be completely reformed to improve quality and increase production. (4) The Labour Party cannot tolerate misconduct by its members, because the future of the British people and even the world is in the hands of the Labour Party.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing Public Utility Prices; the National Economic Council Sets Five Other Measures; the Suggestions Made by the City Council in its Reply Have Not Been Adopted</h3>
<p>In order to fix public utility prices, the City Council previously sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan based on the opinions drafted by its special committee, requesting that the formula for calculating public utility prices be suspended from May onwards and that the subsidy system be restored. If the subsidy system cannot be restored, then the foreign exchange required for public utilities should be allowed to be settled three months in advance, and the allocation of coal at parity prices should be restored. It is now learned that after the Executive Yuan issued this case to the National Economic Council to convene representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Resources Commission, as well as the Nanjing and Shanghai municipal governments, for joint discussion, five other remedial measures have been drafted and telegraphed to the Executive Yuan for approval. The City Council received a reply from the National Economic Council yesterday, and the five measures it drafted are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Since the implementation of the public utility price calculation formula this year, it has been able to keep the prices of various public utilities on a reasonable track and increase moderately. If some base numbers in the calculation formula need to be drafted due to changes in circumstances, the local government should formulate opinions based on the actual situation and send them to the competent authority for research. If the base numbers of some public utilities are too high due to inaccurate accounting, the local government should strictly review the privately-run public utilities. Local councils can provide opinions for reference, and finally submit them to the central competent authority for approval. The state-owned or publicly-run public utilities shall be strictly reviewed by the organizers and submitted to the central competent authority for approval.</p>
<p>(2) If local governments review various prices and find that various indexes fluctuate too sharply, the local government may, depending on the situation, reduce them and may not be subject to the 10% limit.</p>
<p>(3) The central and local competent authorities of various public utilities shall be responsible for urging the industries to improve work efficiency and reduce costs, and this council shall refer to the situation in various places to study the revision of the base number.</p>
<p>(4) Local governments should work with local military and political organs and public opinion organizations to assist local public utilities in preventing theft of electricity and water and unauthorized fare evasion, so as to facilitate operation.</p>
<p>(5) In order to improve the quality of coal used in factories and reduce waste, it is recommended that coal washing be carried out at the mines first.</p>

After discovering this, she was rushed to the hospital for treatment and was saved. However, Ren refused to reveal the reason for the suicide and also refused to say who the woman was. Outsiders then speculated that it was the spirit of the former wife. Ruan then took precautions and had his daughter and a relative accompany Ren to sleep. Unexpectedly, on April 24th, it was suddenly reported that Ren had taken advantage of a moment of inattention and committed suicide with scissors. When she was discovered, she was already dead. However, suspicious points were found after her death. There were hemp rope marks on her neck, and the knife wound on her throat was very large, with the trachea severed. The police suspected that it was murder and transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office detained Ruan Bingfa, his daughter, and the relative who were sleeping with her, as they were suspected of being involved, and the investigation is ongoing. Ren's brother, Ren Muyuan, a journalist from Yuhang County, rushed to inquire and also petitioned the court for a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Exchange Rates to Adapt to Export Industry Needs: Stabilization Board Raises Exchange Rates Yesterday. U.S. Dollar Raised by 150,000 Yuan, British Pound Raised by 450,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Exchange Equalization Fund adjusted the listed foreign exchange rates yesterday morning. The base rates for foreign exchange quotations by designated banks are as follows: (1) Incentive rate of 474,000 yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan; (2) British pound at 1,422,000 yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan; (3) Indian rupee at 106,464.84 yuan, an increase of 33,691.40 yuan; (4) Hong Kong dollar at 85,504.69 yuan, an increase of 28,007.81 yuan. Service fees for designated banks have also been adjusted, with the U.S. dollar raised to 6,000 yuan and the British pound to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to inquiries with relevant parties: This adjustment of foreign exchange quotation is entirely to adapt to the needs of exports. However, the amount of the adjustment is far less than generally expected. Furthermore, although the market for aircraft and daily necessities was stimulated after the foreign exchange rate was raised yesterday, it remained very stable due to tight credit.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the relationship between exchange rates and commodity prices, the reporter made a special visit to the responsible authorities yesterday. It was stated that the determination of exchange rates is decided by representatives from designated banks and members of the Stabilization Board who meet every morning at 9:00 AM for discussion, and the designated banks are notified by telephone before 9:30 AM. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for outside rumors to know in advance.</p>
<p>The standard for adjusting exchange rates is, in principle, based on commodity prices. However, due to common misunderstandings about the relationship between foreign exchange quotations and commodity prices, believing that exchange rates have a stimulating effect, quotations often cannot be fully adjusted. From August 19th of last year to the present, Shanghai commodity prices have risen tenfold, while foreign exchange quotations have only risen sevenfold. As for the black market exchange rate, it has risen fifteenfold, so the Board's exchange rate lags behind general commodity prices. Therefore, the adjustment of quotations, as long as it does not exceed the black market exchange rate, cannot affect the sales of imported goods. Similarly, although exports are settled at the official rate, export commodity prices also exceed the official rate due to government purchases and export proceeds. The relationship between general domestic commodity prices and official exchange rates is very minor. Therefore, the adjustment of quotations, as long as it does not exceed general commodity prices and the black market exchange rate, will not have the effect of raising commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Credit Tightness Persists: Yarn and Cloth Struggle to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market initially opened with a boost from the higher U.S. dollar exchange rate, and sentiment was once encouraged. Furthermore, due to a significant drop at the end of last week, some outside traders seized the opportunity to buy at low prices. However, due to continued credit tightness and frequent allocations from spinning and construction companies, it lacked the strength to rise. After opening, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was sold off at higher prices due to tight positions among traders, falling to 285 million yuan. Towards the close, positions were covered, showing a slight rebound, ultimately closing at 292 million yuan, continuing to fall by 10 million yuan compared to the weekend. Water Moon and Jincheng also declined by 9 million to 10 million yuan. 40-count various brands also fell by 5 to 6.7 million yuan. Arbitrage transactions for 21-count Double Horse yarn were active, with retail investors pushing up the price, rebounding by 10 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns, such as 32-count and 2/16-count, rose by varying degrees of 3 to 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, although the foreign exchange rate was raised, the spinning and construction companies temporarily announced the opening of sales, and the credit tightness continued, and the market atmosphere was unable to rise. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened at 5.88 million yuan, and there were transactions at 5.85 million yuan. Benefiting from the foreign exchange rate, various parties scrambled to buy, and the market surged to 6.18 million yuan. Amidst the chaos, the Hankou merchants sold at higher prices, while the Shanxi merchants bought more. Dye factories had little activity, and brokers had mixed attitudes. At the close, it fell back to 5.95 million yuan, a further decrease of 100,000 yuan compared to the weekend. Finally, many retail investors cut losses, and the price even fell to 5.85 million yuan. Other fine cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and jiji cloth also declined by varying degrees of over 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Further news: The spinning and construction companies announced at 10:30 AM that they would specially allocate 35 types of cloth. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 5.94 million yuan, Four Gentlemen Yuan serge was 5.83 million yuan, Lei Feng Pagoda Yuan straight tribute was 6.3 million yuan, Jumping Fish Essence Yuan poplin was 6.2 million yuan, and Ding Ru Yi bleached cloth was 6.9 million yuan. There were very few applicants.</p>
<h3>The Deadline for Government Purchase of Vehicles and Tires with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange is Extended by One Month.</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of goods with self-provided foreign exchange but without licenses by the Central Trust of China, four items, namely, Western medicine under tariff code 481, trucks under 256A, jeeps under 256B, and tires under 644D, are subject to government purchase. According to the original plan approved by the Executive Yuan, importers should, within one month from the date of purchase acceptance, await government purchase and are not allowed to freely transport and sell the goods. In addition to being announced, it should also be specified in the priority purchase agreement signed with the original importer, and the Ministry of National Defense should be notified to designate representatives to negotiate the purchase directly with the original importer. As the time required for importers to complete customs declaration and cargo retrieval procedures often exceeds the one-month deadline after purchasing these goods, and the Ministry of National Defense must determine whether they are needed only after the goods are presented and the quality is verified, it is practically impossible to negotiate the purchase within the original deadline. It is now reported that representatives from the Ministry of National Defense have requested that the deadline be extended to meet the actual needs, that is, awaiting government purchase within two months from the date of purchase acceptance.</p>
<h3>Fourth Meeting of the Discount and Loan Committee: Approval to Purchase Coal from Wuhan Mines</h3>

<h3>Despite Abundant Supply of Chinese Stocks, Rebound Seen at the Close</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to be sluggish yesterday. The adjustment of the exchange rate could not withstand the supply from banks helping major clients to sell off. However, a saw-tooth pattern emerged at lower levels. Factors such as buying assistance and easing credit conditions led to a rebound at the close.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the market was still sluggish. Yong Yarn opened at a low of 2570 yuan. After opening, the exchange rate changed, and sentiment was boosted. It advanced to a high of 2710 yuan. Agency fees opened high at 33 yuan and 37 yuan. Credit constraints forced open increasing visible and invisible fee amounts, and it fell again to 2595 yuan.

<p>Foreign stocks were inevitably sluggish yesterday, with trading lagging due to mid-day accounting checks. Ewo Yarn opened at 4.68 million in the morning, rising from 4.72 million before declining to 4.45 million at the close. There were no special changes, merely succumbing to credit tightness. Compared to last Saturday, Ye Guang Yi and Gangye each fell by about half a percent, paper boards were flat, and the rest of the stocks saw slight declines.</p>

It was then learned that credit tightened again, forcing a decline to within the 70 million yuan range. The final selling price was 72 million yuan, a significant increase of 5 million yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>Factory silk was weak yesterday. Affected by the tight credit, both insiders and outsiders were at a loss, so trading was unusually quiet. Transactions for all grades of five-dan even cargo were scarce, and asking prices were slightly softer than last Saturday. High-grade zero-dan five-day payment was 480 million yuan, and spot payment was 60 million yuan, with some transactions. Ordinary silk was still around 350 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Alarming Number of Returned Checks: Financial Supervision Bureau Sends Personnel for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to the Central Bank's massive tightening of credit in recent days, the market is extremely tight, and the exchange situation in various commercial banks is very chaotic. The number of returned checks at the exchange office on the 14th and 15th was particularly alarming. According to inquiries from the Financial Supervision Bureau: The amount of returned checks on the 14th reached over 900 billion. Among them, the banks with the highest percentage of returned checks were Da Gong Commercial Savings Bank, Pu Hai Commercial Bank, Yuanyuan Changzhen Bank, Qiankang Money Exchange, Tongxin Bank, Fuxing Industrial Bank, Jiachang Money Exchange, Youde Money Exchange, Tonghui Trust Company, and Tongyi Trust Company.

<p>As the Philippines Black and White basketball team did not participate in the National Games, the team leader Sun Yifa decided to arrange several matches with local teams for observation and liaison purposes, after negotiating with this local basketball association. The first match will be against the Tianjin District World Games preliminary team at the Gymnasium at 7:30 PM tonight. There will be a women's basketball game between the Yunnan Water Quality Team and the Frontline before that. Tickets are 100,000 yuan for upstairs seats, 200,000 yuan for downstairs seats, and 400,000 yuan for reserved seats. Sales will start at 3 PM, and the Siwei Boy Scouts will be on site to maintain order.</p>
<p>Also, the Basketball Referees Association announced that the referees have been assigned but have not been notified. They are requested to report to the venue on time after seeing the newspaper. The service order is as follows:</p>
<p>Water (Women) — Frontline 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Wu Zibin Yu Ju</p>
<p>Black and White — Tianjin (Men) 7:30 PM Liu Hesheng Jin Botao</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Black and White team is a strong team from the Philippines. When they came to Shanghai for the first time two years ago, their performance was affected by the cold weather. They will be returning with renewed vigor this time and are sure to impress the fans. Players such as Xia Huituo, Chuan Yongxin, Ye Kexi, and Zhuang Yulan are all top-notch players in the Philippines. Their fighting strength is no less than that of Chuan Jinsheng. Although Tianjin lost for the first time yesterday, they were able to match Dagong in the first half, proving that they are not weak either. Their fast tactics are very popular with the audience. Their meeting with the Philippine players tonight is sure to be a wonderful performance.</p>
<p>Before the game, there will be a women's friendly match between the local Shanghai Frontline and the Yunnan Water Quality Team. The visiting team has come from afar but was not able to represent their province at the National Games, which they deeply regret. Therefore, they have decided to compete with the Shanghai women's team. They have previously played twice against Hubei and Nanjing in the National Games, winning both times, proving that they are not to be underestimated. The Frontline is a rising team in Shanghai, with good players such as National Games representatives Wang Wuhua and Zhu Min, and are the iron army among the Shanghai women's teams along with Yu Ying and Jin Zhong. They are sure to give a good performance against the visiting team, and it is difficult to predict who will win.</p>

<h3>National Games News: Can Circle the Earth Several Times in One Second, Few People Broadcast at the Venue, Millions Listen Quietly</h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] "Huang Wanzhen breaks the national record! ... Both the Malaysian and Guangzhou teams break the national record in the 200-meter relay..." The tense situation of the swimming competition is transmitted from the radio.</p>
<p>A few days ago, after Zhang Lilang, a famous sprinter from Taiwan, won first place in the 200-meter race, his voice came from the radio: "The result of the 200-meter race is that I came in first, very happy." However, these words were what the track and field instructor from Taiwan told him to say. He ran well, but was panting and didn't know what to say. The reporter happened to be by his side, so he knew this "inside story".</p>
<p>When you enter the National Games track and field stadium, you see two white pavilions erected on both sides of the west command platform, with the words "Shanghai Radio Station" and XORA painted on them. This is the hub for broadcasting sports news.</p>
<p>Large-scale broadcasting of sports news in China is still a pioneering effort. At the same time, not only can radio listeners in the Shanghai area listen, but it is also rebroadcast by radio stations across the country affiliated with the Central Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p>On the track and field or by the swimming pool, holding a microphone in his hand and walking around is the actor Chen Shu. Next to him is a worker carrying a box with an antenna inserted in it. This is the ultra-shortwave transmitter.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Shu reports the situation he sees at the time, which is transmitted by ultra-shortwave to the telecommunications station next to the west command platform, and then sent to the Shanghai Radio Station on Daxilu Road via telephone line to be broadcast to radio listeners.</p>
<p>It sounds like the steps are complicated, but in fact, after the reporter comes out, you can almost immediately hear it on the radio. Because the speed of radio waves cannot be measured by ordinary standards, it can circle the earth several times in one second.</p>
<p>In addition to the telephone line, the telecommunications station is also equipped with a newly imported F.M. ultra-shortwave directional transmitter, which transmits a sound that will never change and will not be disturbed by noise.</p>
<p>This National Games broadcast is co-organized by the National Games Advertising Committee and the Shanghai Radio Station. The National Games Advertising Committee initially invited many movie stars and actors to participate in the broadcast, but due to interest and time constraints, only Chen Shu participated. The remaining reporters were all appointed by the Shanghai Radio Station itself.</p>
<p>The reporting work is intense, and cannot be stopped for even a second. Chen Shu rushed to the finish line of the 400-meter hurdles, and then to the javelin throwing field, going everywhere to report the situation of the competition at the time.</p>
<p>Whether it is the track and field stadium, the basketball court, or the swimming pool, there are reporters active there, constantly reporting the competition situation, broadcasting on 900KC and 1290KC respectively.</p>
<p>This kind of broadcasting work is hard, but these broadcasters are taking this opportunity to learn and open up a new path for the Chinese broadcasting industry.</p>

<h3>A School of "Father Education, Mother Industry": A Recent View of Nantong College</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ling Songshou</p>
<p>For forty years, Nantong College has cultivated a large number of practical talents for China. It started from humble beginnings and has endured countless hardships. Even now, it is still in an environment full of thorns. It is dedicated to nurturing a powerful second generation for the construction of a new China and stands high on the educational pedestal of northern Jiangsu, becoming a tractor on this fertile land waiting to be developed.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jian shouted the slogan "Father Education, Mother Industry." When his industrial foundation became stable at the end of the Guangxu reign, he successively founded three specialties: agriculture, medicine, and textiles, under his principle of "Industry is the foundation of education; education is the means to store talent for industry," forming the prototype of today's Nantong College.</p>
<p>Nantong College inherits the consistent tradition of decades, and it is still divided into three departments: textile, agriculture, and medicine. The separation and combination, the creation and expansion of these three departments have a page of hard struggle history.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture, founded in the thirty-second year of Guangxu, is the oldest of the three departments. Initially, it was called the Normal School of Agriculture and was part of the Tongzhou Normal School. In the first year of Xuantong, a sericulture department was added, and in the second year, it was changed to a two-level agricultural school of primary and secondary levels. The change to a university was in the eighth year of the Republic of China. In the seventeenth year, it was officially merged into Nantong College. The Department of Medicine was founded in the first year of the Republic of China, nominally as a medical specialty school. Later, the Nantong Hospital, the Obstetrics Training Center, the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Midwifery Nursing Training Class were added one after another. Until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Medical University. The following year, it was merged into Nantong College. Among all the departments of Nantong College, the Department of Textile is the most worthy of pride. Its predecessor, the "Textile Dyeing Training Institute," was the first textile school established in China. Through the painstaking efforts of the founder and successive administrators over the decades, the Textile Department of Nantong College has become a school in the Far East with complete equipment and excellent achievements. More than 800 students who have graduated in the past 29 sessions are all powerful cadres in the Chinese textile industry. After the victory, the China Textile Corporation, established by the government with millions of spindles seized from the enemy and puppets, had more than half of its engineering personnel from the Textile Department of Nantong College. The "Textile Dyeing Training Institute" was established in the first year of the Republic of China. By the second year, it had its own fixed school building and was renamed the Textile Specialty School. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Textile University at the same time as the Medical Department and merged into Nantong College in the following year after the renaming.</p>
<p>After infinite twists and turns, the three departments of textile, medicine, and agriculture were finally merged into a concrete institution of higher learning under the same name in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. However, due to various reasons, true unified management began when Mr. Yi Yitong took over as president of the college in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The reorganization came to an end. Nantong College was beginning to move towards a new path. In the twenty-sixth year, the war suddenly broke out. Nantong was close to the war zone and had to suspend classes temporarily. A year later, it moved to Shanghai to resume classes. The Department of Medicine withdrew westward with the army to Hunan and merged with the Jiangsu Medical Administration College to form the Jiangsu Medical College. The Department of Medicine of Nantong College was interrupted during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Victory Returns, Rebuilding the University</p>
<p>After the victory, in the autumn of the thirty-fifth year, the work of restoring the school began. On the one hand, the Ministry of Education was requested to restore the Department of Medicine, and on the other hand, the two departments of textile and agriculture, which had been struggling in Shanghai for eight years, were reorganized. During this period, of course, many hardships were experienced.</p>
<p>The original site of Nantong College, after more than eight years of occupation by the enemy and puppets, suffered a lot of damage to the school buildings and equipment. However, after more than a year of intentional management by the school authorities, it has gradually returned to its former scale. When you pass Qixiu Road in the south of Nantong City and see the four buildings arranged on the east, west, north, and south sides, and the sound of reading aloud, you will surely realize how beautiful the future of Nantong College will be.</p>
<p>The existing three departments of Nantong College are divided into six departments: agronomy, agrochemical, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, agricultural economics (Department of Agriculture), textile engineering, and dyeing and chemical engineering (Department of Textile). The Department of Medicine is temporarily not divided into departments. There are more than 850 students in total. Most of the professors are alumni of the college. The teaching addresses for the third and fourth grades of the three departments of textile, dyeing and chemical engineering, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine are in Shanghai; the first and second grades of the two departments of textile in Tangjia Town in the south of Nantong City, and the rest are at the main campus in Nantong. The plan to move all of them to Nantong and concentrate on teaching has always been in the plan of the Nantong College authorities. However, in order to accommodate the professors, the senior grades of the three departments of dyeing and chemical engineering, textile, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine have to stay in Shanghai. As for the Department of Textile in Tangjia Town, it is purely because it is close to the Dasheng Yarn Factory. If we talk about moving back to Nantong, we will have to purchase textile machinery for students to practice, which is impossible in the current economic situation of the school.</p>
<p>Current Difficulties, Raising Funds</p>
<p>The current difficulty of Nantong College is the economic problem. The prescribed tuition fee is less than that of general private schools in Shanghai. Therefore, the tuition income for one semester is only enough to cover two months of expenses. The remaining four months of expenses must be supported by the board of directors—that is, the Dasheng Yarn Factory. Based on Mr. Zhang Jian's ideal of "Industry is the foundation of education," this was originally the original intention of Mr. Zhang Jian's management of industry. However, if the school relies solely on industry, the prosperity or decline of the school will easily change with the rise and fall of industry. When the current economy is on the verge of collapse and the industrial world is filled with depression, Nantong College should have a self-sufficient plan.</p>
<p>It was mentioned earlier that the three departments of agriculture, medicine, and textile were merged into Nantong College in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. In fact, the original plan of Nantong College was to be renamed Nantong University. Later, the Ministry of Education approved the registration under the name of Nantong College in the nineteenth year because the departments were not yet complete. For the past twenty years, every teacher and student of Nantong College has been thinking about this issue. After the restoration, the school began to surge again with the frenzy of this change to a university. Of course, after the change to a university, many places will gain a lot of convenience. However, at the beginning of the restoration, under the conditions of all aspects, it is indeed difficult to add departments.</p>
<p>In fact, whether to change to a university or not is a matter of form. Today, Nantong College's responsibility and mission to cultivate the next generation of talents and strive for the construction of a new China are no less than those of any university in the country. The area where Nantong College is located is the Yangtze River Delta. In the middle of this area, there are millions of acres of arable land that are still stagnant in the era of manual cultivation and need to be improved; there are hundreds of miles of coastal areas that are still barren land and need to be propagated. It is also a most standard cotton-producing area, and once the coastal area is developed, the increase in cotton production is an inevitable fact, so in terms of textiles, it is also the most ideal research object.</p>
<p>Focus Education, Store Talent for National Construction</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jian's ideal of founding Nantong College is to hope that education and industry will be coordinated, with the development of the rich resources of northern Jiangsu as the focus. Nantong College, especially the Department of Textile, has had a glorious history. In the future process of national construction, Nantong College will certainly take the establishment of an academic center in the northern Jiangsu region as its highest goal. This is in line with the current government's two policies of university decentralization and focus education.</p>
<p>The war is not over, and national construction is difficult. The countryside is depressed, and China needs agricultural talents. The textile industry is immature, and everything has just started. China needs textile talents. President Zhang Yuanyang said: "Nantong College has the creative spirit and excellent tradition of the founder in the innate, and looking forward to the future, there is a major mission in the cause." These few words are exactly where the spirit of thousands of students in Nantong College today is placed.</p>

<h3>Burke on Democracy</h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>The National Assembly has closed, and the President and Vice President have also been elected. Regardless of how the commentators feel about the first assembly, it is formally the beginning of democratic politics. The question now is the question of substance, the question of content, and the question of spirit. What is the spirit of democratic politics? How can we conform to this spirit? This is what we must discuss. The British scholar Ernest Barker is an authority in political science. His views on democratic politics are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Barker believes that democratic politics is primarily a politics of free discussion. Democracy itself "is a disposition and habit of free discussion of ideas." Without this disposition and habit, there will be no democratic politics. The government is a government of free discussion, and the people are a people of free discussion. All political reforms seek conclusions through free discussion. This discussion is free, tolerant, and reasonable.</p>
<p>The expression of free discussion, from the perspective of democratic politics, is expressed through political institutions such as political parties, electoral colleges, parliaments, and cabinets. These political institutions are necessary; otherwise, the effectiveness of free discussion cannot be expressed. Therefore, Barker said: "When a group of free people freely think about their different ideas, freely express themselves in different political parties, freely debate in a freely elected parliament, and in such a parliament, each party and faction—the government and the opposition, the cabinet and the anti-cabinet—freely compromise through free consultation and cooperation, this, I believe, is the highest form of democratic politics." This passage expresses the essentials of democratic politics: first, there must be free people; second, there must be free thought; third, there must be political parties that are freely organized and freely joined; fourth, there must be a freely elected parliament; fifth, there must be the possibility of free debate. Without these freedoms, this is not democratic politics. For example, if there are political parties, but the political parties do not allow people to freely organize and freely join, it is the same as having no political parties. Or if there is a parliament, but the parliament is not freely elected, it is also the same as having no parliament. Everything must be based on freedom. Without freedom, there is no democracy.</p>
<p>However, the disposition and habit of free discussion need to be cultivated, need to be trained, and, in short, need education to be created. Therefore, Barker believes that democratic politics, in addition to the above-mentioned political institutions, also needs other non-political institutions. Various clubs, labor unions, social groups, rural organizations, churches, schools, etc., can be said to be organs for training people to discuss freely. The disposition and habit of free discussion must first be cultivated in these organs. A major purpose of education is to cultivate this habit of free discussion. When people have this habit of free discussion, then the government may be a government of free discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, Barker believes that democratic politics emphasizes means rather than ends. This is the main difference between democratic politics and dictatorial politics. Dictatorial politics can be said to emphasize ends, a politics that chooses means for the sake of ends. In the name of achieving a certain end, all means of oppressing the people can be adopted. In this way, no matter how noble the end, from the perspective of means, it is always dictatorial. Dictatorship is only expressed in means, never in ends. The end claimed by any dictator, which is also the surface end (the inner end is difficult to know), is bound to be noble. Is there any difference between this end itself and the end claimed by democratic politics? For example, saying: seeking the welfare of the people, this is what dictators like to say. Can we say that this end is wrong? Can we say that this end is not also the end of democratic politics? When we consider the end as an end, we cannot distinguish between democracy and dictatorship. What we can distinguish is the means. If the means are wrong, or the means are dictatorial, we can only say that it is dictatorial politics. The politics of ancient wise rulers and virtuous ministers had noble ends, undeniably, and in practice, it may have been beneficial to the people, or it may have been praised by the people, but the means were autocratic, and we can only say that it was dictatorial politics. Ends are achieved through means. If the means are improper, although a certain end can be achieved, it often destroys other ends. The ancients said that killing one innocent person to gain the world is not something to be done, which is to emphasize the meaning of means. Modern democratic politics distinguishes itself from dictators in its emphasis on means. Therefore, Barker believes that free democratic politics "pays more attention to the methods of government than to its ends—more attention to the process of government than to its goals."</p>
<p>The above are a few of Barker's opinions on democratic politics. The author believes that these opinions are very valuable. If the country's policies, whether domestic or foreign, do not have room for free discussion or do not allow the circulation of dissenting opinions, do not allow the opposition party to raise objections, then this kind of politics must not be democratic politics. Whatever politics, democratic or economic, if this condition is not met, it is not democratic. This is what anyone talking about democracy should pay attention to.</p>
<p>In short, Lao Tzu's view of life can be summed up in one sentence: understanding the Way and abiding by the Way. Things and self are both manifestations of the Way in action. Things and self both come from the Way. Although their forms are different, their essence is the same. Forms are separated by time and space, with distinctions between self and other. The Way is one and only one. Its expression and circulation in people and things transcends time and space without distinction. Form is a "vessel," referring to the trunk and limbs of humans, and the solid, substantial form of things. What people and things share from the Way to become human or thing is called "virtue" (de). Virtue is the Way within people or things, using their trunk and limbs, and their solid, substantial form, as vessels, to manifest its function. Understanding the Way lies in breaking the limits of time and space, dissolving the distinctions between people, things, self, and others, connecting to the one root of the Way, and recognizing the common source of all existence. Abiding by the Way means that, based on the common source of all existence, each preserves its virtue, each remains in its place, without invading or harming each other, coexisting in the process of transformation. In the process of transformation, things have formation and destruction, and people have birth and death. Formation, destruction, birth, and death are merely the ripples and undulations in the great flow of transformation. The expression and circulation of the Way is transformation. Transformation often depends on the force of opposition and complementation, so formation, destruction, birth, and death are also events of opposition and complementation, natural and inevitable. The birth, death, formation, and destruction of people and things do not harm the constancy of the essence of the Way, just as the uneven undulations of waves do not diminish the wholeness of the sea. Understanding this, then birth is not to be rejoiced and death is not to be hated. Not rejoicing in birth and hating death means that birth and death are one. When birth and death are one, there is no impediment to establishing oneself and conducting oneself. Being content with fate and enjoying life to the fullest. Recognizing the common source of all existence, dissolving the distinction between self and others, preserving virtue, and abiding by one's place without harming each other means that people and things are equal. When people and things are equal, there is a way to accommodate and interact with others. Establishing oneself and conducting oneself with contentment, treating others with accommodation and harmony, then human feelings will be harmonious and the principles of things will be smooth, and the world can reach perfect order.</p>
<p>The birth, death, formation, and destruction of people and things, the constant flow of all transformations, are the Way acting as transformation. It is hoped that in this ever-changing state, there is an unchanging and constant force, which is opposition and complementation. In opposition and complementation, the opposite does not always remain the opposite, and what is opposed does not always remain the opposed. They rise and fall, and replace each other. In the midst of rising and falling, no person, thing, or event remains constant and unchanging. What remains constant and unchanging is only the essence of the Way, and the path of its expression and circulation (the force of opposition and complementation). The essence of the Way, and the path of its expression and circulation, are both natural and inevitable. Understanding this, abiding by this, following this, then in establishing oneself, conducting oneself, and treating others, there is no partiality, no love or hate. Thus, there is no need for benevolence, no need for what is advantageous or disadvantageous, no need for righteousness, no need for what is noble or base, thick or thin, no need for rituals, no need for creation or action, no need for wisdom. Therefore, it is said that benevolence, righteousness, rituals, and wisdom are the excrescences of the Way and virtue, not what those who uphold the Way and preserve its essence would take.</p>
<p>Only Lao Tzu's view of life: in establishing oneself and conducting oneself, it treats birth and death as one and enjoys life contentedly, so the inner self is always sufficient (sufficient in the Way) and does not rely on external seeking. In treating others, it equalizes people and things and dissolves the distinction between self and others, so wisdom is always inwardly focused, and it despises those who pursue the superficial learning of things. Now, what is sought externally is the means of sustaining life. It is only because one rejoices in life and hates death that one seeks the means of sustaining life. If birth and death are neither rejoiced nor hated, then one does not rush to seek life and avoid death, and what need is there for the means of sustaining life? Therefore, one does not seek it. If people do not seek the means of sustaining life, then the world will have abundant wealth, with nothing to be used for contention. Equalizing people and things and dissolving the distinction between self and others means that I and things are of the same essence (the same essence) without distinction between host and guest. I am things, the host is the guest, understanding my essence is understanding the essence of things, knowing the host is knowing the guest. Thus, "all things are complete in me, reflect on oneself and be sincere" without the need to pursue things as learning. This is why wisdom is inwardly focused, with nothing to overflow externally. Moreover, the distinction between subject and object is what modern people call the hinge of reason. Subject and object mean that one takes oneself as the "knower" and things as the "known." The knower observes the known, just as the host faces the guest. The host and guest are distinguished into two. Lao Tzu dissolves the distinction between people and things, so the view of host and guest is not distinguished. When the view of host and guest is not distinguished, the use of reason cannot arise. From this, it can be said that Lao Tzu opposes what modern people call reason, and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Although Lao Tzu has his own use of wisdom, what is that use for? It is only to embody and recognize the essence of the Way in oneself. "Embodying and recognizing" means using the essence to illuminate the essence, not taking the essence as the "known" and seeking to know it. Lao Tzu calls embodiment and recognition "mysterious contemplation" (xuan lan). "Mysterious" (xuan) means suspended, referring to the essence of the Way. The essence of the Way is suspended and does not cling to things, for clinging to things creates distinction. When it is suspended, it is one. Using the suspended Way to contemplate the essence of the Way reveals that the essence of the Way is one. Seeing the essence of the Way as one dissolves the ego-attachment, for my essence of the Way is the same as the essence of the Way in people and things. However, the Way encompasses both essence and function. Essence is for function, and function is for seeing essence. The two depend on and require each other, and cannot be separated. However, essence is hidden and function is manifest. The task of understanding the Way lies only in recognizing the essence through its function. The flow of all transformations, like people's thoughts and actions, and things' movement, stillness, formation, and destruction, are all the expression of the essence of the Way. Therefore, the task of understanding the Way lies only in examining the traces of people's thoughts and actions, movement, stillness, formation, and destruction, in the midst of the flow of all transformations, in order to see the common source of people and things, and that their thoughts and actions, movement, stillness, formation, and destruction, are all the expression and circulation of this essence. Then the fact of embodiment and recognition is the task of essence and experience. Experience is for recognition, and recognition exists in the midst of experience. Recognition and experience are two and one, one and two. "Recognition" (ren) means "knowing," and "experience" (yan) means "doing." From this, the unity of knowing and doing can be seen. In the language of the Book of Changes, the matter of embodiment and experience is carried out only in the midst of establishing oneself, conducting oneself, and treating others. When the experience is true, then the recognition is thorough, just as when the action is skilled, then the knowledge is detailed. This is the task of using function (the function of the Way) to illuminate the essence (the essence of the Way).</p>
<p>Using function to illuminate essence means that the essence is not empty or silent. Illuminating essence to attain function means that function is not lost or chaotic. Essence is constant, function is change. Essence is stillness, function is movement. Knowing the constant and preserving stillness, then one can handle change without confusion, respond to change without yielding. The trace of change reveals the constancy of essence, the exterior moves while the interior remains still, the body labors while the heart is at ease. This is the highest attainment of cultivation. Therefore, it is said that Lao Tzu's view of life can be summed up in one sentence: understanding the Way and abiding by the Way. Understanding the Way and abiding by the Way means knowing the constant and preserving stillness. Knowing the constant allows one to respond to change, preserving stillness allows one to control movement. Change attains its place, movement accords with its appropriateness. Establishing oneself and conducting oneself are always upright, and treating others is always beneficial.</p>
<h3>Professor Whitehead: On Chinese Science</h3>
<p>— Zuoyu</p>
<p>The British philosopher Professor A.N. Whitehead recently passed away, and this magazine had an article commemorating him. He had never been to China, so he is not as well-known in China as Dewey and Russell. However, he had a considerable understanding of Chinese culture, especially a deep understanding of the reasons for the underdevelopment of Chinese science.</p>
<p>In his book "Science and the Modern World," Whitehead mentioned Chinese culture. He said: "The special balance of mind required for science has only occasionally and irregularly been discovered in many great cultures, and has produced very weak results. For example, the more we know about Chinese art, Chinese literature, and Chinese philosophy of life, the more we admire the peaks reached by this culture. For thousands of years, many keen-minded and learned people in China have devoted their lives to research. Considering the length of history and the size of the population, China constitutes the broadest culture the world has ever seen. We have no reason to doubt the inherent ability of individual Chinese to conduct scientific research. But Chinese science is actually insignificant. We also have no reason to believe that if China were left to its own devices, it would produce any scientific progress." In this passage, Whitehead's revelation is that the Chinese have the spirit to study and also have the inner ability to study science, but the reason why Chinese science is underdeveloped is that the Chinese lack a certain mind or mentality required for science. Whitehead further explained the reasons why the Chinese lack this mentality in another book.</p>
<p>In his book "The Function of Reason," Whitehead also talked about the reasons for the underdevelopment of Chinese science. He believed that what science needs most is "speculation." However, this speculation is speculation controlled by method, not uncontrolled speculation. We can say that what science needs is speculation and method, not just speculation. The Greeks were rich in speculation, and the Chinese were also rich in speculation. But the speculation of the Greeks produced science, while the speculation of the Chinese could not produce science. What is the reason? This is because the speculation of the Greeks was controlled by method, and they knew to pay attention to observation and facts, so it could produce important results. On the contrary, the speculation of the Chinese was not controlled by method, and their speculation was like an unbridled horse, running arbitrarily. As a result, the speculation turned into fantasy or delusion, and produced no results. The speculation of the Greeks was genuine speculation, while the speculation of the Chinese was mostly fantasy or delusion. The difference is that one knows to pay attention to method and has methodological awareness, while the other does not know to pay attention to method and has no methodological awareness. Method is an element of science. The mentality required for science is the mentality of methodological awareness. The cultivation of this mentality lies in training with method. The training of method is the main way to create the mentality required for science. If China wants to seek scientific progress, it must pay attention to method. (The above is not the original language of Whitehead's book, but the author's extrapolation based on Whitehead's meaning). I don't think anyone can deny Whitehead's point of view.</p>
<p>Traditional scholars in our country do not pay attention to method, or at least they have no methodological awareness. This is the main reason for the underdevelopment of science in our country. Now, scientists in our country know the importance of method in words, but they do not regard method as a discipline and study it. Therefore, there is no course on method in science and engineering colleges. The author believes that this is still the tradition of neglecting method.</p>
<h3>Bosanquet on the Imperfect Self</h3>
<p>— Zhiru</p>
<p>(2) The simple self is a naive, simple self without contaminated habits. This virtue is the basis for his ability to do good, so in principle it cannot be said that he is bad, or it can even be said that he is good. However, he lacks experience, so he does not have the ability to deal with the world and lead a highly civilized life, which is his defective imperfection. But a simple self that does not know anything may be good, and a very knowledgeable heart may be evil. So the simple self can be compared to an article that only has basic principles but no detailed theories, rigorous systems, or rich content.</p>
<p>(3) The bad self. The above two kinds of self do not yet have a firm and clear individuality, so there is neither a significant and positive consistency with the infinite or absolute, or the whole, nor a clear and positive conflict. At the same time, there is neither harmonious and elegant content within, nor contradictory and base mechanisms. So it cannot be said that they are perfect, nor can it be said that they are qualitatively evil. The so-called bad self is different from them, because the bad self can have a firm character, consistent behavior, rich knowledge, and deep understanding. Viewed individually, he is a very complete individual, he has his own style, which can arouse people's admiration, he has his theory and proposition. If you acknowledge his theory and proposition, you may acknowledge that he is good. But if you go beyond his individual stance, stand at a higher level, and look at him with a broader perspective, you will find that he is in conflict with the whole and is a truly bad person who cannot be tolerated by mankind. Therefore, the badness of a bad person is not that he personally has no merit, but that he is in conflict and incompatible with good—the whole. This kind of self is like an article that has a reason and is logically consistent, but cannot be compatible with the entire experience, so the whole is false. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Forbidden Words from the Academy (22)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Western Philosophers on North China (Middle)</p>
<p>Comparing China and Europe, one immediately notices significant differences. China's land area is slightly larger than the entire continent of Europe. Foreigners often overlook this point when discussing China. It's crucial to understand that China isn't like a single European country but is equivalent to the whole of Europe. China is currently divided into approximately thirty provinces, while Europe is divided into around thirty countries. Their territories are distinct, with fortified borders, frequent disputes, and deepened animosities after the recent Great War. In the past, during the Roman Empire, Europe showed some tendency toward unification. However, it has failed to unify since the fall of Rome. What is the reason for this? Today, Europe is merely a geographical term, whereas China is a single nation with a shared language and culture. Although it has experienced repeated wars over thousands of years, China has consistently relied on its inherent culture to establish a nation-state. R.H. Tawney, a professor at the University of London, stated, "Based on my travels, I deeply feel that China is not just a geographical unit but possesses a vibrant national character." China's unity is, in fact, the natural result of its unique culture undergoing long-term development.</p>
<p>The late Lord Northcliffe, owner of The Times of London, once expressed his impressions of traveling in America, saying, "Foreigners traveling in America find its scenery and style to be uniformly consistent. Observing from the outside, it's nearly impossible to distinguish which state or city one is in. The breakfast menus, the hairstyles of girls, and so on, are all uniform throughout the country. The people's appearances and manners are strikingly similar to each other. Only the Chinese people also share this sense of unified style." Lord Northcliffe visited China in 1921 and wrote to his family from Beijing, "Everyone says that being with the Japanese feels uncomfortable, but when one gets to know Chinese scholars, one feels a sense of camaraderie. I share this sentiment. This is because the national characteristics of China and Britain are quite similar." Lord Northcliffe's words may seem like a truism, but they contain deep meaning, because he is talking about something that most people know, so it feels plain and unremarkable.</p>
<p>During President Lincoln's term in the United States, Anson Burlingame was appointed as the U.S. envoy to China. After serving as minister to Beijing for six years, he, as an American, received a commission from China to serve as its envoy to Western countries. Burlingame arrived in the United States in 1868, and that year, various circles in Boston hosted a banquet to welcome the Chinese envoy and his entourage. Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the hosts, expressing his admiration for China. The point he particularly emphasized was the importance of education in the Chinese political system. Emerson believed that Confucius's personality could serve as a model for human endeavor. Great figures are those who can put the highest morality into practice, and morality is the life force of the universe.</p>
<p>Confucianism regards self-cultivation as paramount. Only by working on self-reliance and self-achievement can one attain spiritual dignity. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University, once said, "The physical, intellectual, and mental strength of the individual is the driving force behind any true culture." The central concept of Confucius's educational philosophy is the completion of personality, and those who possess the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage are called "gentlemen." Only gentlemen can become statesmen, and only gentlemen can become good and benevolent global citizens.</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Governance is about rectitude," and rectitude is used not only to govern the state but also to bring peace to the world. Rectitude is the key to solving domestic and international problems. Emerson once gave a speech praising President Lincoln's emancipation of slaves. He believed that Lincoln's actions aligned with the great principles of Confucianism. Emerson believed that the teachings of Confucius could serve as a yardstick for measuring modern history. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, drew inspiration from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on the surface, but in fact, the concept of civil governance in China has deep roots in its inherent philosophy. The current global war is caused by some extreme ideas since the nineteenth century. The connection between cause and effect is clear. We should pay as much attention to these ideas that can cause war as to the war itself. In our view, extreme ideas are the most powerful weapon. Isaiah Bowman, president of Johns Hopkins University, said, "There are two ways to ensure world peace: one is the doctrine of human rights, and the other is the combined strength of nations upholding justice. If humanity is not free, it will become slaves." China has always adhered to the policy of being kind and friendly to its neighbors, and this is not merely empty talk but is often put into practice.</p>

<h3>Opening the Skylight</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>I believe everyone still remembers that in the period shortly after the war, American goods "flooded" Shanghai. A pound of Klim milk powder sold for only 1,500 yuan per can, and glass handbags, straps, combs, and nylon stockings were only tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. A gold-plated Parker pen was only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Parker ink, which now costs 300,000 yuan per bottle, was readily available on the streets at that time, costing only 500 to 600 yuan per bottle at its cheapest.</p>
<p>Based on the income of the average wage earner at that time, it certainly cannot be said to have been very cheap, but at least Klim milk powder and glass products were still within the purchasing power of the general public. And those slightly moldy chocolate candies were in the hands of everyone, more popular than the cheap squeezed ice that cost 500 yuan per stick.</p>
<p>But around this period, a group of politicians and economists, so-called representatives of "national capitalists," came out and argued that the influx of foreign goods not only depleted foreign exchange reserves but also threatened the survival of "national industries." Therefore, they advocated that the import of foreign goods should first be limited to production tools and raw materials that the country could not manufacture. As a result, Florida oranges were the first to be targeted, followed by luxury goods such as nylon, lipstick, and face powder. As for milk powder and canned food, they could only enter the black market due to foreign exchange restrictions.</p>
<p>From the perspective of developing "national industries," all these measures were naturally beyond reproach, because international trade cannot only involve imports without exports. If a country is poor and still spends huge amounts of foreign exchange on importing unnecessary luxury goods, it is tantamount to promoting national economic suicide. Although Florida oranges and Klim milk powder are delicious and nourishing, for a country that still relies on foreign aid for rice and flour, it is ultimately too much.</p>
<p>Going back to the basics, everyone naturally hoped that our so-called "national capitalists" and "national industries" could take advantage of the government's restrictions on imported goods to make a great effort, at least to allow the common people to wear cheap cloth clothes and eat a bowl of cheap rice. To put it bluntly, the common people have long been so hungry that there is not even a drop of oil left in their stomachs. For example, some places had the kindness of the UNRRA to distribute milk powder, providing milk powder to the poor in disaster areas like tea on a familiar road. However, they either vomited after eating it or suffered from diarrhea (this is not fabricated by the author; "Life" magazine once published photos and texts about this). This also shows that we are not yet blessed to enjoy such "supplements." If we can have a mouthful of rice, everyone will feel that the world is at peace.</p>
<p>However, recently, we suddenly heard our "national capitalists" hiding in Hong Kong, which cannot yet be considered our "national" territory, shouting loudly about the "crisis" of "national industries." However, this time it is not about American goods related to "foreign exchange" but about goods from the East. It is said that the markets in Guangzhou are now flooded with Japanese goods, and their low prices and wide variety have forced our "relocated" "national" capitalists to cry out in alarm.</p>
<p>If it were not for this outcry, we would not have known that the so-called "national capitalists" had already moved to Hong Kong, a colony of the British Empire. Of course, we have also seen news of "capital moving south" in the newspapers, but given the size of China, some people have long divided our country into regions such as "North China," "Central China," and "South China," so there is nothing wrong with capital moving south. However, although Hong Kong also belongs to "South China," it cannot be said to be "national" after all, so how much of the "national" capital's move south is for the sake of "national industries" is something that everyone understands even if I don't say it.</p>
<p>Anyone with a little knowledge of economics naturally knows that capitalism, at a certain stage of its development, does have a very strong national character. However, today, "where the profit lies" is synonymous with "capitalism." In pursuit of profit, whether something is national or not is no longer a consideration. To speak plainly, the black market American goods and large-scale Japanese smuggling that are flooding the markets now cannot be done by anyone who does not have strong capital. Because everyone knows that the profits from smuggling far exceed the profits from legitimate production, is the so-called southward movement of national capital not actually for the convenience of smuggling over there?</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I cannot help but yearn for the era of 1,500 yuan per can of Klim milk powder, and I can only sneer at the cries of crisis from the "national" industry! If there is no cheap cloth to wear and cheap food to eat, why should I care about the "national capitalists" who are shouting about the crisis of "national industries" in foreign colonies!</p>
<h3>Celebrities and Beds</h3>
<p>— Ding Ling</p>
<p>The great poet Milton loved to compose poems in bed, going to bed every evening to write poetry. Later, when he became completely blind, he would have dinner at eight o'clock every night, smoke for a while, drink a glass of water, and then go to sleep. While lying in bed, his poetic inspiration would surge, and his daughters or secretaries would record his dictation, which is how he completed the great "Paradise Lost."</p>
<p>The English philosopher and mathematician Thomas Hobbes spent most of his life in bed. He liked to draw mathematical diagrams on his clean white sheets, without which he could not work or fall asleep.</p>
<p>The French philosopher René Descartes spent a lot of time in bed due to his weak health, pondering deeply in bed and completing his immortal masterpiece.</p>
<p>Voltaire's sharp articles showed his extraordinary intellect, and his great works were also cultivated from bed. His thoughts would surge while he slept, completing his drafts, which he would then write down early the next morning.</p>
<p>The British literary eccentric Dr. Samuel Johnson was a lifelong heavy sleeper, although he tried to change it many times without success.</p>
<p>Louis XVI slept in 413 beds in his short life.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens insisted that his bed must face north, so when he slept away from home, he always carried a compass with him to arrange his bed.</p>
<h3>Cave-Dwelling Rome</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huangshi</p>
<p>Because of the lack of housing, the people of Rome are now living in the ancient times of "cave-dwelling and wilderness lodging."</p>
<p>Italy suffered considerable damage during the war. Refugees gathered in Rome in order to make a living. After the war ended, veterans returned home one after another, but the authorities did not have the ability to arrange for them, so many of them turned to banditry in order to survive. The more educated people found other jobs.</p>
<p>Because all of Italy was suffering from hardship, their opportunities were very limited. So those who could not find legitimate jobs for a while flocked to Rome and engaged in speculative businesses.</p>
<p>The population of Rome is now double what it was before the war, but the housing is limited. As a result, cellars, air-raid shelters, under eaves, beside large trees, dry riverbeds, memorial towers, and the foot of arches have become temporary residences.</p>
<p>But what about the rich? They still live comfortably in the midst of the housing shortage, with apartments, villas, gardens, and all kinds of sanitary facilities.</p>
<p>Judging by the housing situation alone, Rome is a paradise, but it is also a hell.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Zhang Nanpi Killing His Wife in a Fit of Rage</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In my book "Records of Personal Objects," I wrote: "Zhang Zhidong of Nanpi and his wife were deeply devoted to each other. After they had a son, one evening, they suddenly had an argument over the child. Zhang Nanpi, in a fit of rage, accidentally kicked his wife down. He rushed to help her up, but she was unconscious, with blood flowing from her nose. By the time a doctor was called, it was too late, and she died the next day. So he bought a coffin and buried her with all the proper rites, transporting the coffin back to his hometown. Her brother, Zixiang, wanted to launch a punitive expedition, but fortunately, Zixiang was a student of Zhang Nanpi's respected father. Out of respect for his teacher, he was reluctant to cause trouble, so he demanded that the funeral be lavish. Zhang Nanpi's respected father agreed, and a lawsuit was averted. However, Zhang Nanpi did not dare to go home for more than a year, as he was very ashamed to face Zixiang. Later, Zhang Nanpi's respected father arranged for him to marry a Miss Gao in preparation for remarriage. Zhang Nanpi still felt uneasy about it, thinking that although it was not forbidden by custom and did not violate reason, it seemed difficult to justify his feelings. So he postponed it until three years later before finally completing the marriage, and he often missed his former wife and remained uneasy for a long time." Jing Meijiu, a famous figure in the Nanshe literary society, saw my work and said that it was indeed true, and he also said that Zhang Nanpi was an official in Shanxi. One day, he personally tried a case in which the principal offender was a woman. As soon as she came to court, Zhang Nanpi suddenly fainted. The officials were shocked and quickly helped him inside. He only woke up after a while. It turned out that the woman in the main crime was the criminal woman, whose appearance was very similar to the wife he had killed. Zhang Nanpi's nerves were suddenly stimulated, and he could not help but fall to the ground. Unexpectedly, I recently received a letter from Jiang Shiyao in Guangzhou, which said: "Sir, you are knowledgeable and have extraordinary insight, which I have always admired. Your book "Records of Personal Objects" is precious and valuable and can indeed be used for historical records. However, because there are so many descriptions, it is inevitable that there are some rumors that are not true. For example, the article in the book about Zhang Nanpi killing his wife in a fit of rage is suspected of being untrue. I have a great interest in studying the life stories of people who have made slight achievements in various aspects of China in the past hundred years. Therefore, I have collected many biographies and chronologies of related figures. According to the records, Zhang Wenxiang married Shi in the fourth year of Xianfeng. In the sixth year of Xianfeng, Zhang Ying, the respected father of Wenxiang, died in Guiyang. In the same year, his brother-in-law Shi Jun died in Duyun. In the fourth year of Tongzhi, his wife Shi died in Beijing. In that year, Wenxiang graduated and was ranked first class. In the sixth year of Tongzhi, he served as the deputy examiner of the Zhejiang provincial examination. After the death of his wife Shi, Wenxiang remarried Tang, and there was no marriage with a Miss Gao. The book said that after Nanpi killed his wife, his brother-in-law wanted to launch a punitive expedition, which was tactfully blocked by Nanpi's respected father. If Nanpi's family had not had the shelter of adults, then the son would have been imprisoned, how could he have been able to learn and advance in officialdom. According to the years, they do not match: (1) Nanpi's first wife, Shi, died ten years after her father and brother-in-law; (2) Nanpi only served as an examiner in Zhejiang after the death of his father, so how could there be any words about learning and advancing in officialdom in his family. All this proves that this is a fabrication. Sir, you have heard rumors from others and did not have time to check Nanpi's chronology and biography, which led to this error, but it does not affect your wide learning." According to what I have seen in the published letters of Zhang Zhidong, it is said that he reported to his father, all of which are detailed in the family letters and are not fabricated. However, Jiang Jun's account based on the chronology and biography is also reliable, so one is false and one is true, and one of them must be true. Could the published letters of Zhang Zhidong be forged? It is very confusing and incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>Small Talk Among Flowers</h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>Boiling cranes and burning zithers are ancient metaphors for spoiling the scenery, just as shouting on a pine-covered path or drying underwear under flowers is equally embarrassing! Now, if you try to set foot in a park, you will often see sugarcane residue all over the ground, which is offensive to the eye and unbearable. Song Ruozhai, a lay Buddhist, had a manifesto in his hall with four subjects: "Flowers Should Be Praised," "Flowers Resent Jealousy," "Flowers Receive Honors," and "Flowers Suffer Humiliation," totaling fifty-eight articles. He posted it in the hall so that visitors would be warned and enlightened, and his love for flowers was evident in his writing. He was truly a refined and thoughtful person.</p>
<p>Flowers, with the cultivation of the seasons and human effort, become increasingly beautiful. They are also praised by their owners and immortalized by famous writers, further enhancing their honor. The two subjects of "Flowers Should Be Praised" and "Flowers Receive Honors" will not be repeated here. Only the articles on "Flowers Resent Jealousy" and "Flowers Suffer Humiliation" will be presented to enlighten the vulgar and so-called "refined-yet-vulgar" gentlemen of the world.</p>
<p>(1) "Flowers Resent Jealousy": In wind, continuous rain, scorching sun, bitter cold, ugly women, vulgar people, crows, bad poems, discussing current affairs, discussing official positions, shouting on flower paths, unfurling scarlet curtains in front of flowers, appreciating flowers with drums and gongs, composing poems with tableware and messengers.</p>
<p>(2) "Flowers Suffer Humiliation": Vulgar people plucking and breaking them, stingy owners, planting them in rich people's gardens and giving them obscene names, coiling and knotting them into screens, appreciating flowers with vulgar prostitutes, planting them under the windows of mediocre monks, inserting them into bottles in restaurants and wine shops, having dog feces under the trees, drying clothes on the branches, painting blue paper screens with powder, growing in vulgar alleys and ditches.</p>
<p>In recent times, with the development of science and the advancement of gardening, human power can rival nature, and clever ideas compete with natural creations. Wind, continuous rain, scorching sun, and bitter cold can all be avoided by artificial means. However, it is easy to change the natural environment, but it is difficult to cure the vulgarity of mankind, which is lamentable.</p>
<h3>Ornamentation Notes</h3>
<p>— Bentian</p>
<p>As far back as three thousand years ago, Egyptian women were already deliberately dressing up. A blue-green peacock-shaped stone pendant and a tightly closed small gold-threaded box were excavated from a pyramid. These were all the belongings of Queen Sobekneferu of ancient Egypt. The hand box was just over two inches long and contained a small spoon, probably for scooping rouge, and a pair of delicate tweezers for removing eyebrows.</p>
<p>In Africa, different tribes have different decorations. Women of the Fulata tribe wrap their fingers and toes with flower leaves to create a beautiful and dazzling purple color. They also dye their hair blue, paint their teeth blue, yellow, and purple, and apply antimony sulfide to their eyelids.</p>
<p>Women of the Hottentot tribe, in order to be considered beautiful by their men, smear their bodies with butter, kerosene, and a fragrant leaf, creating a strange smell and strange color to attract men.</p>
<p>African natives are fond of tattoos. They scar their bodies with lines, fill the wounds with soil, and form raised scars, which they consider beautiful. Some natives also paint their bodies with white paint to highlight their brown-black skin. Still others paint their bodies with antelope blood and cover their hair with mica powder for decoration.</p>
<p>In one area of Australia, only men can use cosmetics, and women are only allowed to decorate their faces, otherwise it is against the law. Warriors decorate their skin with red, yellow, white, and blue dyes, so merchants can make huge profits by selling pigments at high prices. Conversely, in New Zealand, cosmetics are exclusively for women, and they dye their noses with pigments.</p>
<p>On the islands of the South Pacific, natives use needles sharpened from human bones to pierce various patterns on their bodies. They embed a blue pigment made of coconut ash and water into the skin. Often, people die because they cannot bear the inhumane carving. Tattoos are also popular among Mexican natives. In addition, some of them file their teeth into sharp shapes, while others drill into them and fill them with jade and silk gems.</p>
<p>American Indians paint their bodies with dyes, especially when going hunting or preparing for war.</p>
<p>Egyptian priests burned incense to fumigate the body. This incense was made from a mixture of several spices and used to coat the body to protect the skin.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Zhao Jianqiu (Chunnian) of Wujin and Dong Shoujing (Kang) were from the same hometown, passed the provincial examination together, held office together, lived in the same residence, and had a very deep friendship. Zhao's wife, Ms. Lu Tonghua, was a talented woman from Changzhou. She wrote "Qingsheng Pavilion Lyrics" and had it printed into a large and exquisite book. Dong Kang wrote the preface for it, saying: "Kang was in Beijing and lived with Jianqiu in the old residence of Pan Wengong (Wengin) in Mishi Hutong. I often heard Ms. Lu sing new songs, and flowers bloomed beautifully. Chun Ting's happiness and longevity complemented my research, and Gao Zhai's joy continued my records of epigraphy. (There is a plaque in the living room that says "Happiness and Longevity Courtyard" and a plaque in the study that says "Pangxi Zhai," both of which are Pan Gong's old relics.) Jianqiu is a talented scholar, elegant and refined. He loves and cherishes his virtuous wife, and people praise them, saying that they are no less than Wei Gong and Zhong Ji, or Hanshan and Qingzi." The middle section says: "Ms. Lu is influenced by fragrant customs and draws from worldly learning. She is skilled in writing and has long been proficient in literature. She also dabbles in slow and soft tunes. In addition, she understands the six scripts and is particularly good at seal script. In the late spring, the green shade is sparse. In the deep autumn, the yellow flowers make people thin. She is as talented as Yutai in poetry and loves the music of Jinlian. She has made a pact to retreat together in joy, and she looks like a fairy." He elegantly and meticulously portrays the friendship between Dong and Zhao, the harmony of Zhao and Lu, and the clear talents and beautiful writings of Ms. Lu, which also shows the extraordinary talent of old Dong's writing.</p>
<p>Dong and Zhao both passed the provincial examination in the year of Wuzi, but Zhao passed the imperial examination several years later. Dong passed the palace examination in the year of Jichou, while Zhao only passed the provincial examination in the year of Wuxu. However, in the year of Jichou, Zhao had already passed the examination to become a drafter, while Dong was a judge in the Ministry of Justice. Although they were not in the same yamen, they were both officials in Beijing. Zhao had been in the cabinet for many years and had been recommended to be a prefect. After passing the imperial examination, he was appointed to his original position and assigned to Jiangxi, where he served as the acting prefect of Ruizhou. At the end of the Guangxu reign, he was promoted by Tang Wenzhi to walk in the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, and then served as a member of the National Assembly. Dong was promoted to judge and then to senior judge in the Supreme Court. Both of them were qualified for the position of a high-ranking official in Beijing. After the Republic of China, Zhao served as a counselor in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and as the vice minister of finance, never leaving the fields of industry and economy. Although he was in retirement for twenty years, he was still able to maintain his livelihood. Dong served as a specially appointed official in the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Justice for the longest time. He also served as the minister of finance for a very short period of time. During the period of Japanese occupation, Zhao was able to live in seclusion and preserve himself. Because he had no card to sell, Wang Kemin and others, although old friends, troubled him with positions such as director and secretary-general. Zhao naturally did not accept, and he only enjoyed poetry and wine with old friends of the same generation. I and Dong and Zhao were both friends of the Wuzi year. I was often invited by old man Jianqiu to drink in Pangxi Zhai. Old Dong lived in Xizhuan Hutong, which was only one alley away from Zhao's Mishi Hutong, very close to each other, but even at Zhao's place, Dong was rarely seen, which shows that he lived in seclusion and rarely went out, and had his own difficult reasons to say that he was old and sick. Zhao Jian died in the thirty-first year of the Republic of China at the age of seventy-five. The night before, he went to the theater and drank alone in a small restaurant. When he returned, he slept soundly all night. The next noon, there was still no sound from him. The family thought he had gotten up late, but when they checked on him, he had already passed away without any illness. He can be called a man of complete happiness.</p>
