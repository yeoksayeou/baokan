<h3 id="c27">論傳聞中的幣制改革 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 載世允</p>
<p>勝利之初，在後方昆明，重慶各地的物價平均爲戰前者六千倍左右。日本請降消息傳來，社會心理爲之一變，後方物價在短時期內曾下降至三千倍；八年繼續貶值的法幣，居然臺花一現，增值百分之五十，可以視爲抗戰勝利的重要點綴。其後，內亂繼續，並逐漸擴大，稅收不振，軍費支出與日俱增，通貨膨脹的現象變本加厲，物價上漲更爲兇猛。屈指至今，爲時不過兩年零十個月，不足三年，北平市的批發物價指數已爲戰前的一百萬倍以上了。共他京，滬，漢，穗各地物價增加的倍數雖有略低於北平者，實則所差有限。以此爲準，物價在不足三年的時間內，竟上漲了三百借，速度可爲駭人聽聞。法幣貶值如此之甚，對經濟社會的影響當然是非常之惡劣的。因此，政府近來爲表示新的作風起見，居然又間接的宣稱將改革幣制了。</p>
<p>目下傳聞中的改革幣制計劃頗爲具體，政府發言人對之也並未作肯定的否認，至少已公開聲明改革幣制的計劃勢在必行，僅實施期限朱定而已。關於改革幣制計劃的內容，大致的包括下列各點：（一）對內恢復銀本位；（二）對外採虛金本位；（三）銀幣單位重庫平四錢二分，美金一元折合銀幣五元，每元銀幣折合法幣二十萬元；（四）實施後四個月內計劃收回現在流通的法幣。一種傳聞的幣制改革居然如此具體，頗能使我們相信這至少是醞釀中計劃的藍本，我們應該提出討論。</p>
<p>首先容我們說明傳聞中計劃中的法定比率問題。如果美金一元折合銀幣五元，這是屬於虛金本位下國內貨幣與美金聯繫的規定。按理，虛金本位應該規定若干含金量的虛設本位，以爲國際貿易計算的單位。但是，實際上金銀比價時時變動，這由於銀子的需要相對的减少，過去銀價業已逐漸跌落。因此，一元美金折合五元銀幣的折合率是無從維持的。至於一元銀幣折合法幣二十萬元的規定，則更欠妥當。即以六月份的物價而言，均計爲職前的一百萬倍；法幣一百萬元略等於戰前一元的購買力。目下在黑市中，戰前銀元（重庫平七錢二分）售價約爲七十五萬元左右，如按物價，則重庫平四錢二分的銀幣應折合五十八萬元左右，如按戰前銀元的現在價格，則銀幣也要折合四十二三萬元。所以，以銀幣一元折合二十萬元法幣的規定，可以看作將物價壓低，也可以看作把銀幣價值壓低。實際上，商人或生產者多半對銀價沒有具體的概念，恐怕會將物價按二十萬對一，折合銀幣數量，結果將等於把物價抬高了。由上述兩方面來看，希望只是一種傳聞，否則，這種規定的比率是很有問題的。</p>
<p>其次，再論傳聞中的貨幣改革計劃。「對內採銀本位，對外採虛金本位」的辦法實即戰前凱末爾爲我國所擬的虛金本位的貨幣改革計劃。不過凱氏計劃中的銀幣並非本位幣，只是一種代表幣；或者銀輔幣；代表幣的實值與面值並不相等，面值高於實值。覬氏之所以如此，乃爲了免除當銀價貴的時候，銀幣曾被人民收集熔毀而產生貨幣缺乏的情形。發近傳聞的幣制則係對內採用銀本位，規定銀幣單位的庫平重量；並且由於與美金的聯繫，銀幣的面值與實值是一致的。這一點與凱氏計劃的重要區別即在國內物價計算單位上：如果銀幣只居輔幣地位，則計算單位仍以虛金本位的單位爲準；如果以銀幣爲本位則一切計算均以銀幣爲準，虛金本位另屬國際貿易方面的一種單位。以後者言，等於金銀兩種貨幣並用，屬於貨幣制度中的複金本位。複金本位的害處極爲明顯，其主要關鍵即在於銀價的變動，換言之，將由世界銀市塲的銀價不穩定而影響我們的幣制不穩定。不論銀價降低或者銀價上漲，對國內都產生不利的影響的。固然銀價趨賤可以增加輸出的貿易；銀價貴則在國外的購買力增加，利弊似乎不能一概而論，實則，就貨幣的本質言，價值務必以穩定爲主；貨幣價值穩定也就是物價相對的穩定。所以，虛金本位之外，在國內另採銀本位，殊欠妥當，原則上，仍以採單純的虛金本位爲佳，銀幣只應居於代表或輔幣的地位。此外還有一點與本問題有關係的，就是虛金本位與外匯本位的區別。嚴格的講，傳聞中的幣制屬於外匯本位而非虛金本位。因爲，虛金本位固然不必鑄造金幣流通，但須規定一種含若干金量的虛設本位；以這種含金量與某一個國家幣制的含金量相比，來決定外匯平價。如今，以國內銀本位幣與美金直接發生聯繫，將來美元價值的波動將直接影響國內物價，這樣將更增加一種幣制不穩定的因素。所以在原則上傳聞中的幣制本位也是有問題的。</p>
<p>最擭，我們要論到改革的條件·以目下的情形而言，這一方面的問題建比前兩層爲重要。就首段所論，我國物價在不足三年的時間內上漲三百倍，幣值貶值如此之甚，其基本原者由於政府財政收支不能平衝，以印鈔票來代　財政收入；後者則由於內戰繼續擴大，交通寸斷，和社會不安。這兩種基本因素若不能消除，幣制改革是沒有意義的。我們目前所採用的貨幣制度並非制度不好，而是政府運用的不當，尤其錯誤的是把財政政策和貨幣制度不加分別，把關係全國公私經濟活動的貨幣當作財政的工具。戰前兩三年物價比較穩定，更足見近來的物價問題並不是貨幣制度的罪惡。今後如果戰事不停止則生產和交通都難以改善，物資必然缺乏；如果政府財政收支不能平衡，支出依然超出收入甚多，即設改換幣制，大量鑄造，銀幣使用，結果物價問題還是存在的。人民對具有實值的銀幣固然有信心，但是，唯其如此，人民必然盡可能的將之窖藏起來。同時政府財政收支不能相抵，白銀數量有限，政府必然發行兌換券，結果，窖藏銀幣之風更爲擴大，兌換券的實值必然减低。輾轉之下，最後政府將被迫而放棄銀本位，通貨繼續膨脹，物價上漲又將重演。所以，幣制改革的條件如果不够，改幣制將徒勞而無功。</p>
<p>總之，爲了挽救我國經濟的危機，幣制是必須改革的。但是，在目前實際上恐怕作不到。最重要的，必須先具備改革幣制的條　件，同時須研究合乎國情，針對國際環境的一種貨幣制度。</p>

<p>— 吳嘉棠</p>
<p>本報採訪室主任吳嘉棠，此次游日歸來，陳述聞見，昨已於本報專論中刊登第一篇，茲自本日起於第二版繼續連載。吳君此行，以時日匆促，所得甚微，僅憑個人印象，抒寫觀感，然其客觀報道，或足爲關心日本政情者之一助，尚希讀者注意爲幸。（編者）</p>
<p>美國扶植日本成爲遠東兵工廠的論調，甚囂塵上，但自記者親身赴日考察後，深感這種看法，在極淺近的軍事常識上不能成立。因爲如果美國俱有這個企岡，其唯一之假想敵人，必然是蘇聯，可是大戰一且發生，日本是站在第一綫。蘇聯可以隨心所欲，以雷霆萬鈞的空中威力，隨時粉碎美國在日本建立的兵工廠。所以美國決不會笨到連這一點亦想不到，而會把兵工廠和戰時生產機構放在第一綫的。由此我們可以明白這種說法，不過是一種欺人之談，或者是別含用意吧了。</p>
<p>發展日本成爲遠東兵工廠的論調，僅是一種巧妙的宣傳，有其確定的目標。他們希望盟總因此而受到世界與論的壓迫，使其無法改蕃日本的生產水準到自給的最低的程度，進一步說他們的陰謀是加速日本全部經濟的崩潰。此點如能實現，日共勢力將乘隙而入使日本全部赤化。事實上，這是蘇聯對全球的基本打算，在中國·捷克·日本·都是如此。在冷靜的研究日本問題時，這一點是必須考慮到的。</p>
<p>盟軍總部之重建日本經濟秩序，實爲阻止共黨赤化日本之唯一辦法。我們可以根據事實，證明其途徑之正確。日本今天已經喪失其國外殖民地，原料來源及市塲亦隨之喪失。戰前散佈於各地的人口集中於本土三島，人口因之成爲日本的嚴重問題。根據一九四五年十月一日至一九四八年二月廿九日間的統計，日本的人口增加了七百十萬。因此，日本政府必須在盟總指導之下，去設法解決這七百多萬人的糧食問題。日本在一九四七年的糧食生產量是一千三百萬噸，現在必須要增加二百萬噸，來維持人民的最低食物水準。以目下日本人口增加之速，糧食增產率決定追不上人口增加率。因此，這二百萬噸的食物，必須用外匯向海外購買。目前這批食糧正由美國以實物或款項供給，日本每年要對美國負四億美金的債務。不但如此，日本今日又是物價高漲，人民的實際所得日益减少。以米價而論，去年二月，東京的黑市米價是每公斤四〇·二七日圓，到今年二月已漲到每公斤一三〇·四九日圓。在一般物價水準上，情勢亦同樣的嚴重。去年三月的物價指數是一三七·一，到今年三月上漲到三一〇·六，上漲在一倍以上。</p>
<p>在這種嚴重的經濟局勢下，如果不設法提高一般的生產水準，很可能因此造成社會和政洽的擾動，再加以第三國際勢力的支持，終能造成暴風雨的來臨。</p>
<p>我在日本的時候，曾比較和研究過他們的工業生產水準。今年三月份日本的生產水準，是戰前標準的百份之四十九。所謂「戰前標準」，是指一九三〇—三四年間的平均數字，一九三七年後的作戰時期，並不包括在內。一九四一年是日本生產力的最高峯，是「戰前水準」的210.5％。去年的生產數字是百分之四〇·九，費了一年的努力，才提高百分之九，達到百分之四九的水準。今年三月，日本的紡織生產，僅是戰前生產的21.7％，三月份棉紗生產是戰前水準的百分之二一·四，同月絲的產量是戰前水準的百分之一六·九，三月份棉織品的產量，僅合戰前水準的百分之二六·七，而人造絲織品的生產數字，亦僅是戰前水準的百分之一九·四。在金屬工業部門，本年三月份的產量，是戰前水準的百分之五十，三月份生鐵產量，僅是一九三〇—三四年戰前水準的百分之四二·九，而珍珠港事變前夕的生產水準，高達百分之三三八·三，蘆溝橋事變時，亦達百分之一八四·七。精鋼本年三月份的產量，合戰前水準的百分之四八·九，而一九四三年高峯時，達百分之二八七·三，一九三七年時，亦達百分之二一三·一。事實上，如以噸數來計算，日本現在的鋼鐵產量，尚遠在遠東委員會的限量之下，日本理在的鋼塊年產量是一百五十萬噸，而遠東委員會的最高限量是三百五十萬噸。在化工業部門，今年三月份的生產指數是戰前水準的60.3％；如以噸數來計算，亦遠在遠東委員會限量之下。例如今年日本的硫酸產量，估計可達一百九十四萬噸，而遠東委員會的限額是三百五十萬噸，今年燒碱的產量，估計可達九萬六千噸，但是遠東委員會的限量高至六十三萬噸·這種數字的對比，應該最可以說明日本今日工業水準的眞相。至於這些數目字的正確性，一位中國駐日代表團的人員告訴我：大體皆可靠。這些數字可以表示日本工業的生產水準離自給之日尚遠，而以目下之進度言，更談不上搆成成脅。我認爲盟總預計在一九五三把日本工業提到自給的標準，實在是過於樂觀，即以全力去做，恐怕連達到目標的可能性也極少。</p>
<p>我認爲如果供給日本以原料和市塲的接近地區，長期陷於經濟混亂和不景氣，日本的工業和整個經濟亦不能單獨的達到穩定的目標，甚至可能因之亦走下坡路。即使有盟總及日本人自己的努力，其經濟情勢的進步，亦必遲緩而艱苦。如果美援突然中止，而留下一個中國及其他遠東委員會不能填補的眞空，情勢必然惡化。蘇聯對這點看得最淸楚，他們亦知道盟總亦無意把日本造成一個兵工廠，如果眞有事實的話，蘇聯代表早會在遠東委員會開砲了，但她迄今毫無表示。</p>
<p>至於史揣克瓊期登報，與此更難相提並論，要認淸的是，這兩個檢討是「個報告而不一定搆成遠東委員會的政策，即是在美國方面馬歇爾，麥克阿瑟及盟總高級人員亦未必對兩個報告的建議全部同意，我這種說法，並非空中樓閣，確有事實的根據，惟目前尚未到發表的階段而已。</p>
<p>美國爲使佔領日本政策合理化，而派遺專家赴日實地調查，其動機在解決問題，未可厚非。而在民主方式下，這個調查報告自必公諸遠東委員會各會員國。倘使一旦這稱報告性檢討性的文字一公佈，就被誤會曲解而遭抨擎，無異是變相鼓勵不公開和單面獨斷行動了</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林廿三日電〕蘇聯當局宣布：蘇聯佔區及大柏林市之幣制改革，決定於廿四日實施，同時並通知西方佔領國，彼等並無行政上經濟上或政治上之理由，使彼等留在柏林。彼等必須接受蘇佔區之幣制，不然將受經濟或行政的制裁。紫柯洛夫斯基之下令柏林四區須同時接受東德之幣制改革，不啻爲向英美法三强眾政府長官直接挑戰。三强長官於本星期一已曾個別致函案柯洛夫斯基，聲明彼等之堅決拒絕承認大柏林市爲蘇聯區之一部，或大柏林市之須受蘇方任何片面命令之束縛。在此種局面下最受窘者當爲柏林市政府，索柯洛夫斯某已令柏林市府在全市執行蘇價局之幣制改革令，然西方三軍政府長官亦已通知柏林市府，囑其不須遵從蘇當局命令，在英美法三區內執行蘇當局之幣制改革令。索柯洛夫斯基致西方三長官之函，聲明由於西方强國之於上週末在其佔區內實施幣制改革，因而破壞德國之統一，故蘇聯當局亦已決定在整個蘇聯區及大柏林市全部實施幣制改革。在蘇當局作實施幣制改革之先，四强專家曾於廿二日下午起開會討論在柏林實施四强基礎的幣制改革之可能性。談判至昨日深夜卒無結果而散。蘇軍政府參謀長魯坎眞祠遂於今晨函致柏林代理市長，內稱，加蓋特別戮記之馬克券，決於六月廿四日起通用，自廿六日起未有戳記之舊馬克券及盟國軍政府發行之馬克券，在蘇聯區及大柏林市一概禁止流通。索柯洛夫斯基分別致英美法軍政府長官之函有云，英美法佔領當局之宜布在西德實施單獨的幣制改革，已使蘇佔區處入困難的地位，使本人不得不採取措施以保獲編人民，蘇佔區及柏林市經濟之利益，防免因西德舊幣流入蘇區而引起之紊亂，因此本人已決定在蘇聯區及大柏林市之實施幣制改革，希望閣下勿在柏林閣下之管轄區內，妨礙此一幣制改革之施行。</p>

<p>三區當局已令區內各銀行商店，除出售糧食藥品之商店外，於廿四日起一律停業，直到另發通告之日止。三區當局之佈告並曰，目前在三區通行之舊馬克網續有效，所有一切物價亦繼續維持不變．西德之德意志馬克將在柏林西區通行，西區之價務在續發通告前暫時停止支付，在續有命令前，東德通行之貨幣輸入柏林西區將被視爲非法，有違背此令者決予嚴懲。關於兌換新德意志馬克之詳細情形，不久即可宣布，此項命令由三强總司令聯署，由美軍區內之電台廣播，對於何時施用德意志馬克並未規定確期。同時柏林居民鑒於「柏林之戰」已屆揭幕前夕，莫不驚恐萬分，彼等深知索柯洛夫斯基通函內所稱之「經濟制裁」，將使柏林西方三區之德人最受痛苦。聞蘇聯當局頒佈之新幣制，亦爲以新幣一換舊幣十馬克，實細之細則預料即可宣布。</p>

<p>〔路透社費城廿三日電〕共和黨候選總統諸競選人中，以杜威之當選呼聲爲最高。芝加事論壇報主筆要考密克向記者表示，除非有意外的一面倒形勢，杜威殆將必定當選無疑。</p>
<p>〔合衆社費城廿三日電〕阻止杜威當選之聯合陣綫二十三日晨已解體，使杜威對一九四八年之共和黨總統提名，已穩握勝利左券。但渠仍必須擊敗參議員塔虎脫，塔虎脫在二十三晨接見俄亥俄州代表團時，仍稱，彼將抗戰到底。</p>
<p>一般相信：阻止杜威當選之領袖，廿三日仍將計劃集曾，再圖勞力，如彼等再不能產生公開之妥協，則杜威在二十四日投票時，已無敵手，本雪凡尼亞州長特夫，係杜威之有力障礙，但杜威已擊破其防綫，在本雪凡尼亞州之七十三票中，最少渠已能得二十八票。許多州代表團在二十三日舉行預選會，若千主要代表團可能公開其立塲，杜威可能自彼等獲得可貴之選票。聯合塔虎脫，史泰遜及范登堡之實力以打擊杜威之努力，於二十二二日晚及二十三日晨之一連串會議中失敗，但預料史泰遜及塔虎脫仍將於二十三日晤談，其他之會議亦將接蹤而至，當二十三日晚本雪凡尼亞代表團舉仃預選會時，阻止杜威當選之運動可能有新發展，如特夫能控制相當多數，則阻杜運動仍有一綫生機，如特夫失敗，則此龐大之代表團將立即瓦解，轉而支持杜成。</p>

<p>任主委之報告三點：（一）該會業務。略以該會奉中央命，本年三月至六月間四個月，試辦配米。業務甚爲繁雜，以經收米款而論，六月份即達二萬五千億元，平均每日將收千億元，而全體工作人員，僅三百餘。（二）配米繼續問題，七月份起，中央決定，決仍繼續配米。中華救濟團因滬市配米成績好，特允在中美雙邊協定簽訂前，准許滬市先動用美援米。此外糧部亦撥到糙米三萬噸，同時，又續向仰光等地及國內產區收購。七月份之配米證昨已分發各區，各區市民可於廿八廿九兩日取得配米證。該證不發則已，有發必配，配價一個月內亦不變動。現正積極籌劃本年七月至明年九月間之來源，俾使配米繼續不斷。（三）個人對配米制度，尚具信心。配米制度之繼續，配米額能增加，使市民獲得各人應得之米，才是根本之辦法。拋米政策雖未盡完善，惟至少亦足以安定產區米價。</p>
<h3 id="c56">質詢民政方面 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>民政局方面，有黃振世，陳培德兩人質，所提問題：（一）保甲長同屬公職人員詢有義務，無權利，徒失事理之平，應有同樣享受公教人員配給物資之權權利。（二）自衛隊究竟何時可組成。（三）各保甲辦理合作社進度如何。</p>

<p>五時十五分，質詢警局完畢，休息十分種，質詢社會局之節目登塲。提出質詢者有張志韓·張中原·王宗灝·范錫品·嚴謬聲·費樹聲·丁善明·周學湘等八人。質詢要點有如後開：（一）舞潮案迄已近拖延五月，尚未判決。社局可否網開一面，勿再窮究。（二）油商業公會理事長張超配油舞斃罪　，請查明答覆。（三）配油品質氣味不佳，亦請查明原因。（四）勞資糾紛，已有筆錄仲裁後，勞方如有遠反情事，即遭拘辦，而資方違反時則否，何故。（五）爲何單獨執行旅館業之限價。（六）獎光火柴廠之勞資糾紛拖延已達一年有五個月，何以始終未作評斷，內幕究竟如何。（七）銀棋業依法納稅，何以無法復業。京·漢·穗·津各地銀樓均經營金飾交易，獨滬市禁止，何故。（八）聞業登記證由公會彙轉反遭遇困難，何故（九）生活指數之編製，是否確切。上月工人指數卅三萬七千倍職員廿八萬倍，而批發物價指數已達一百廿四萬倍，兩者成四與一之比，生活指數落後太甚，深覺有人爲控制之嫌疑。，同時，公教人員指數，亦謂市長應向中央力爭調整。（十）戶口糖何以必須向指定糖店購買，今後可否仿配油米辦法，由市民任擇配售之商店。</p>
<h3 id="c58">醫生不顧道德應請注意糾正 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>衛生局方面，有處舜·范守淵·姜豪·嚴諤聲·傅曉峰·陳保泰等六人提出質詢，問題有：（一）許多公立醫院無錢不救命，請調查。（二）少數醫生不顧職業道德，不負資任，應注意糾正。（三）第一宰牲塲員工太多，是否可裁縮。（四）宰牲塲所收費用，遠在宰牲所需費用之上，何故。（五）行總結束後移交於衛生局之物資，係爲分配病人之用，衛生局何竟配予局方職員。（六）本年兒童節時，物資供應局拍賣大批霉爛糖果，衛生局是否注意及之，又發現霉爛是否取締。</p>
<h3 id="c59">吳局長自信氣度夠對舞潮案無心報復 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>社會局吳局長答復質詢謂：自信尚具氣度，對舞潮案，決不存心報復。工人不服裁定時，因常釀成工潮，影響社會秩序，應急之計，遂不得不由警局先行維持秩序。資方違反時則批送法院核辦。承認於勞方不無吃虧，以後仍當設法，力求公平。美光事件，處理經過，自問於心無愧。銀樓業無法復業，個人並未硬性規定。惟如照黑市買賣金飾，茍遭法令干涉，則個人實無法負責。承辦戶口糖之商店須先繳款後領糖，與油米之先領貨後付款不同，故有指定糖店購買之規定，容再與台糖公司洽商改進辦法。</p>
<h3 id="c60">俞叔平答覆質詢金鈔案奉命辦理 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>警察局兪局長首先登台作簡要之答復。渠稱：警察局與警備部職權之劃分，現尚乏專門條文規定，金鈔案件較重大者，中央均有令着警備部直接辦理。林王及三慰兩案，均由中央指令移交特別法庭辨理。衆發事件，現監察使署及地檢處正偵查中。爲預防計，分令各區切實調查區內堆存危險物品情形，俾飭令改善。經濟警察，係就內政部動員戡亂條例而設置。成立後，至少可使物價不暴漲。經警負責人，多係飽學經騐之士，警員亦均係高中畢業程度，瞭解經濟法令，故素質尚高。飛行堡壘取義於FlyingstUabron，確有相當功效。榮軍事件，係屬憲兵與警備部主管。對警士風紀，個人素極注意。對任後查辦處份之部屬，數不在少，可見個人整飭風紀之決心。</p>

<p>三時五十分起，質詢警察局首先開始。參議員吳正燧·趙君豪·邵永生·嚴諤聲·馬君碩·陳伯艮·潘介眉·黃振世·童襄·韋雲靑·謝大荒·楊撫生等十二人依次提出質詢。茲歸納質詢要點如次：（一）查禁金鈔烟毒，警察局與警備部職權如何劃分。（二）衆發堆棧事件，主管人員何以不送司法機關辦理，偵查有無凟職嫌疑，又類此案件，今後有無預防計劃。（三）若干大規模經營黑市金鈔案件，雖經破獲，結果雷聲大，雨點小，是何原故。林王三慰兩公司一案，請公佈辦理經過。（四）經濟警察常因搜查黑市金鈔，苛擾市民，以後對告密案件，是否可先行密查後，再付行動。（五）街頭流動銀洋攤，何故置若罔開。（六）有自稱榮軍之軍人，騷擾各商店，何不查緝。（七）經濟警察大隊之成立，於法何據。對穩定物價，有何助益，人員素質又如何。（八）楊樹浦閘北區等打風甚盛，聞該區等警士有與地痞勾結情事，小民商店，備受騷擾，應請調查整飭部屬。（九）勞資糾紛中，警士有利用機會，勾結資方，壓迫勞方之事實。（十）乞丐搶奪卡車所載棉花雜物，警察多不問不聞，何故。</p>

<p>十三爲不祥之數，已成慣例，參議員席中之第十三席，本次會議中臨時出空。</p>
<p>大會開到下午五時卅分前後，每人配給饅頭一客（二隻），據說：參會每天定二八〇客，五次大會時饅頭每隻一萬二千元，這次已漲到三萬五千元。</p>
<p>吳正　質詢警局時說，許多金鈔案消息的末尾，總說牽涉甚廣，又說與某要人有關，結果常常就此沒有下文，眞是神龍見首不見尾，大案都成漏網之魚。</p>
<p>邵永生質詢說，經濟警察裏有許多是交通警，拿管制紅綠燈的慣技，跑到股市紗市，就說祗許跌，不許漲，物價管制，似乎決不如此簡單。</p>
<p>他又說：飛行堡壘，顧名思義，應該是在天上飛的，而實際却是在地上爬的幾輛吉普車，純是標新立異的新名詞。</p>
<p>新雅飯店小便斗中忘記放置樟腦丸，就遭警局罰款，而且必須店主親到警局應訊，嚴諤聲說，這是跡近苛擾。</p>
<p>大家說，上海目前正過着光明前的黑階，而馬君碩却說，上海近來白天黑夜都遭遇着可怕的光明——就是那接一連二的火災。</p>
<p>有些警局，常有人到各商店關照說，有事時需跟某人「聯絡聯絡」，這是何緣故。昨天有幾位參議員都在質詢中提到。</p>
<p>謝大荒大套質詢之後，又說兪局長爲標準長官，溫文爾雅，弄得俞局長祇有搖頭苦笑。</p>
<p>張中原高喊，現在祇要一包三砲臺，就可開一天旅館房間，旅館業再要限價下云，不出一個月，上海一千餘家旅館只好關門大吉了。</p>
<p>配油氣味難聞，開過磨坊的參議員王宗灝說：這氣味活像死人棺材上剛上的漆。</p>
<p>上海要買十條廿條的大金條，儘有辦法可想，可是小民想買一兩二兩的金飾，倒是求購無門，這是什麽現象，嚴諤聲爲銀樓業的復業問題，力爭理由。</p>
<p>費樹聲說，現在的生活指數是　，實際物價是兎，越追距離越遠。</p>
<p>各地楊妹型人物層見迭出聲中，姜豪問衛生局，滬市聞有不食之人，是否有檢查之價偵。</p>
<p>兪局長答復質詢時說：經濟警察「吃力不討好」，參議諸公如果一定認爲存在無用，局方可考慮取銷。</p>
<p>社會局吳長自稱老實人，結果總吃虧。本市銀樓業無法復業，就是他太奉行中央命令的結果。</p>
<p>他說：生活指數他願以人格担保，絕對準確。生活指數之低，吃虧在房租標準限定爲七千倍，而房租在生活指數中却佔有舉足輕重的比率質詢拾零。</p>

<p>本市物價自上月份起，波動更烈，全市各業工會，咸以五月份生活指數距離物價甚遠，紛向總工會具呈指責，建議改善，經該會生活指數研究會商討，並經提交四十六次理事會議決洽本治標辦法多種，於昨日正式具文市政府，市社曾局，請予採納施行。要旨如下：</p>
<p>（甲）治標力面：（一）此次政府普遍配米，市民所食者每斗五十萬元，其與市價相差部份，實爲政府惠施於人民福益，工人亦屬本市市民，自當同受此項福利。惟編製生活指數，概以配價計算，且達五斗之鉅，無異已向工人扣還配米之差金，是則此項戶口配米，僅及農商學各界人士，工人無與焉，故擬請以一斗照配價計算，餘則照市價。（二）煤球請照市價計算，緣工人旣未領得配物，而生活指數又以配價計算，實難緘默。（三）每星期調查物價一次，必須改善，因邇來物價轉週性縮短，波動甚烈，大有早晚市價不同之慨，如欲近乎公平合理，應改每日調查一次。（四）生活指數應改爲半個月發表一次，緣各廠例有半月發薪，俾工人所得，能任本月應用，而目前發給之工資，概依上月之指數計算。（乙）治本方面：（二）應即重新舉行家計調查，以切實際。（二）凡指數所列各項實物品質權數，務宜合理調整，以符工人實際需要。</p>

<p>詢至此，庭諭改期，並將筆錄交四被告當庭閱讀後，更正簽字。復以四被告罪嫌較重，除在地檢處所交保證外，另諭劉安平，蔣能祥兩被告加繳二十億元，徐鑫，鄧誥章兩被告加繳三十億元之書面舖保。</p>

<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>今日接到報館方面的通知，以本報實行縮張，篇幅分配，發生困難，決定自七月一日起將七種周刋，均予停刋。因之我們便祗有和讀者告別了。「出版界」在本報周刋中是籌命最長的一種，這一方面是表示本報編輯部提倡學術的精神，一方面也是因爲讀者和作家熱烈的愛戴。這次實因受紙張篇幅的限制，而不能不將周刋停止，事非得巳，希望讀者原諒本報的苦衷。</p>
<p>編者本人今年暑間，計劃赴美。一方面想充實自己的內容，在西方的文化思想方面多多的用功學習；一方面應他們那邊幾個大學的邀請，講述中國的學術思想，希望在宣揚中華民族精神，溝通東西文化方面，有一點小小的貢獻。對於「出版界」的編輯工作正在担心如何繼續的時候，聽到周刋停刋的消息，這在編者本人如釋重載。</p>
<p>但是我對於本刋的讀者和投稿的先生們却要表示十分的歉意。在今日中國物質條件貧乏，精神糧食飢荒的時候，一般有志的靑年和好學的成年們希望用各種經濟的方法來滿足他們學習和求進步的慾望，而根據讀者的報告，本刋在這一方面確曾略盡其棉薄，而我們對於這一點棉薄的努力現因受着物質的限制以致不能繼續，這是我們應該向讀者道歉的。國家對於這些好學深思之土更應該抱愧。</p>
<p>本刋的稿件除極少數特約者外，大多數都是投稿，而且來稿的水準多是相當的高。可見這都是各位作家精心之作。我們自已也是寫稿的，所以對於它們都很珍愛。諸位的投稿無論用與不用。我從不拋棄。有許多要用的稿子往往因爲篇輻的關係延擱數目之久。再加以近來投稿擁擠。我們便　集了許多的好文章。現在本刋停止，勢必劇愛，這又是我個特別要向投稿諸君歡歉的。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於許多不用的投稿，　有一點聲明。本人選擇的標準第一是書本身的價值，第二是評介文的優美，自信相當客觀。有幾次的來稿是介紹編者本人的著譯，因爲避免自我宣傳之嫌，都未採用，深以爲歉。有許多讀者詢問本人的著譯，平日亦均未致合，現在可以奉告諸位本人著譯偏重於哲學和心理學方面，在商務，中華和世界均有出版，欲知書名，請查各書店目錄。諸承埀愛，統此致　。再會！</p>

<p>— 明</p>
<p>趙曾玨著　中華書局出版</p>
<p>英國生物學家華廷暨（C．H．Wadington）在臨所著「科學態度」（Sceintific．Attitude）一書中，將科學家分爲兩類，一爲技術專家，一爲科學地思考的人土。依照他的說法，枝術是包括在科學之內的；這可以說是廣義的科學。最近讀到趙曾玨先生新著書「科學與技術」，從其命名及內容，可知他之所謂科學是指純粹自然科學，故以之與技術並列。</p>
<p>本書雖是討諭科學技術諭文的結集，然而它的理論則是前後一貫的。著者認定我們中國苟欲競存於現代國際之林，舍工業化外，別無途徑，而工業化的基礎則在於技術，技術的基礎又在於科學。這眞是一個顚撲不破的眞理。他又說技術的目的是「利用厚生」。引申言之，就是技術的目的在於「民生」，在於「公共福利」，蓋著者的意見，認爲我們中國工業化應當以民生爲中心。雖然著者同時强調國防的建設，但與民生的建設並不衝突，因爲他的國防論也是以民生爲中心的。很顯然的，如果沒有國防，民生便不能建設起來。所以我們要「買犁」，以建設民生，同時要「買刀」，以建設國防。他們英國科工協會正在討諭「賣刀買犁」，但是我們與他們不同，因爲我們根本無刀可賣，而且根本沒有備過足可抵抗敵人的刀，因此過去吃了大虧，所以我們今日不得不在買「犁」之外，更買一柄「刀」來。同時更需要自已能製造新「犁』和新的「刀」。二十年前，吳稚暉先生說，人家以機關槍打進來，我們應該以機關槍把他們打出去。在二十年後的今日，此話仍然是有價值的。其實，如果那些想以機關槍打人的人一日不消滅，此話是永遠有價值的。所以筆者對於趙先生的國防論完全同意。誰能保證我們今後永不這到第二次大考呢？</p>
<p>著者非但認定技術爲工業化之基礎，同時更注意組織與管理的重要性。很明顯的，技術需要「效率」，而組織與管理則是獲致高度效率」的方法，但是組織與管理究爲形式的，而最緊要者在於心理基礎之奠定，否則使是一種機械，而不是一價有機體，僅有消極的作用，而不起積極的作用。所以著者除注意「組織」與「管理」之外，更注意工作情緒的培養。關於此點，著者認爲一個優秀的技術家，尤其是我們中國的，對於哲學，文藝以至體育都需要相當修養，然後絻能得到勇猛精進和活潑愉快的工作情緒，面此種工作情緒即是「組織」與一管理」的心理基碮，其理論具見本書第四編各文，此處不另稱引。我們固然知道科學與按術都貴乎專精，但是一種學問的成功常需要他種學問的輔助和啓發，所以學問的縱的發　與橫的發展是相輔相成的。如果一個科學家或技攏家單單在「專精」上做工夫，其流弊爲性情偏執，生活枯燥，愛迪生說，事業的成功，百分之九十九是「苦功」，百分之一是「靈感」。這告訴我們：縱有百分之九十九的苦功，而缺少百分之一的靈感，則仍然不能得到百分一百的成功。但是道「靈感」決不是枯燥與單調的生活所能孕育出來的。所以趙先生主要工作情緒的培養，實在有其至理。</p>
<h3 id="c119">和平？強權乎？ <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>

<p>Peace　or　Power　by　H．Butler</p>
<p>Faber　and　Faber　Ltd，London．</p>
<p>書價十五先令，共二七〇頁。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰的血跡未乾，而第三次世界大戰的危機，又潛伏在仳界各處，隨時有爆發的可能了，因此在世界各國人民的心頭，都有着兩個迫切的問題：一個是如何以一個「和平世界」來代替現在這個「强權世界」？另一個是如何調和東方與西方之間的衝突？這兩個問題的解決，要靠全世界愛好和平的人士，以大家的智慧來探索出世界的前途，白特勒先生的「和平乎？强權乎？」一書，對於這些問題的解決，實有重大的貢獻。因此在此時介紹白特勒先生的巨著，格外覺得意義重大。</p>
<p>白特勒先生是英國第一流的國際政論家，曾在日內瓦担任國際勞工局局長達十八年之久，一直到一九三八年國際聯盟解體，始辭職返國，故對於歐洲各國的實情，比任何人認識得淸楚；後至第二次大戰期間，白特勒先生奉外務部之命，前往美國，在駐美大使館內，負責辦理情報的工作，深知世界各國的實情，且其足跡到過加拿大，南美洲以及亞洲。所以他寫國際論文，不像理諭家處處以理想來憶測，而是一個實際的外交家，政論家，一字一句，都有事實的根據。尤其是本書，是他在一九四六年遊歐回來後寫成的。此外，他並撰有「失去了的和平」（The　Lost　Peace）一書，他有一個獨特的見解，就是他認爲今日東方與西方的衝突，並非完全是共產主義與民主主義的衝突，而其發生衝突的根源，仍在歷史之中。所以他主張，目前最重要的工作，乃在使世人完全諒解過去所發生的事實以及明瞭目前正在發生的事實。這一個主張，是值得我們重視的。茲將該書內容，作簡略的介紹如下：</p>
<p>第一章「未能締成的和平」，從國際聯盟成立說起，講到第二次大戰爆發的經過，把二十年內的國際關係，解釋得淸淸楚楚，同時並指出第二次大戰爆　發的原因。</p>
<p>第二章「强權的因果」，作者目睹歐洲各國的情形，最初德義英法人民對於戰爭，均無狂熱參加的情緒；尤其是中立團口以寫納粹　　，必能遵守　際公法，因此相信自己的中立與和平，可以獲得尊重，但後來均遭到德國的侵犯，而捲入戰爭的漩渦·</p>
<p>第三章「東方與西方」，指出西方國家的民主政治崩潰之後，而在德義的反民主的思想，便應運而生，一般勞工階級均傾向蘇聯。他們雖不知蘇維埃政體的實情，但對於外界所有的反蘇宣傳，均抱着懷疑態度，若能聰任其在法西斯主義與共產主義之間，抉擇其一；那末他們都寗願選擇共產主義。</p>
<p>第四章「西歐各國的艱苦」</p>
<p>第五章「機國的打算」，作者認爲德國人民是不幸的，在最近的三十年內，遭遇到兩次不幸的浩劫，其根本原因，乃在一九一八年的戰敗，並未能消除了德國人民好戰的心理。後來希特勒以民族主義來煽動德人，也就一發不可抑制了。</p>
<p>第六章「東歐的曙光」，第七軍斯拉夫的復興，把戰後東歐各國的情形，作一綜合的報道，世人對於鐵幕內的東歐各國，向來不明其實際情况，這兩章是格外値得注意的。</p>
<p>第八章　。「蘇聯在歐洲」，指出戰後的蘇聯在歐洲已處於領導地位，東歐各國均以蘇聯馬首是瞻；第九章英國爲勝利所償付的代價，第十章英國聯邦的不一致處處表示出英國的悲哀，今日英國對於歐洲，巳不復能保持其戰前的地位，英國與歐洲各國所有的傳統關係，均已不復存在了。第十一章美國的長驅直入，作者說蘇聯的勢力雖已深入歐洲的心臟，推翻了歐陸所有一切的舊制度；但是在美國，卻也英勇地向歐洲長驅直入，以致造成美蘇兩國的衝突，使歐洲各國的命運格外微妙與複雜。</p>
<p>最後一章是結論，和平乎？強權乎？作者很感慨地說，第二次大戰雖已成爲歷史，但和平尚未締造成功，而在歷次國際會議中，東方與西方總不能獲致妥協，因此雙方的「目的不同，思想不同，」日見露骨，雙方的衝突更由暗鬥變爲明爭。實爲人類的一大不幸。（二四八頁）所以今日的世界，仍是强權世界，締造和平的努力旣已失敗，欲使聯合國機構不蹈國聯覆轍的努力，也已流產。不過在世人的心裏，仍保有一種信念，認爲有效的國際組織，實爲保全現代文明所不可缺少的。所以和平與强權的鬥爭，誰勝誰敗，今日還在未定之天呢！</p>
<h3 id="c120">申報地圖編印記瑣 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 曾世英</p>
<p>本文所稱申報地圖包括中華民國新地圖，中國分省新圖等，凡爲該報發行之地圖而言。此項地岡的編印，常時在技術及事業方面，都可說是一種嘗試。筆者祗知在技術方面埋首工作，對　事情的後果，初未計及，即發動計劃的幾位先進，對於此圖的信心，當初恐亦無十二分的抱負，僅在勉力爲之而巳。現在且舉編慕中華民國新地圖合約中的一節於下：</p>
<p>「…以上各圖應歸出版人印刷銷售，定價至少每冊四圓…</p>
<p>這項限定最低售價條文的含義，可有多種解釋。當時則預計銷行不會太多，顧慮印刷的草率，所以有此一條君子協定。不意事實適得其反，申報以發行的經驗，把中華民國新地圖，定價每冊二十五圓，即其縮本中國分省新聞，亦定了三元一冊。</p>
<p>我們都知　申　的發行地　，在紀念其六十週年，就是筆者一向也是這樣想法，但最近有人說起，當時丁在君先生的友人中，看到他淞滬督辦下台以後的經濟拮据情形，想贈送一筆生活費用，但又深知在君先生一介不取一介不予的個性，如果說送錢，一定被拒絕，所以想了一個委宛的辦法，要求他領導製圖，那知他把這筆經費，完全交給筆者支配，眞正用在製圖方面。這一段傳說的是否可信，祇有詢諸當事諸人，但合約上有這樣一條：</p>
<p>「出版人應於十九年入月一日付薯作人銀一千　，以後每月一日付銀六百元，至二十年十一月止，合計共付銀一萬圓，爲編製以上各圖費用」。</p>
<p>到了二十年十一月，編製工作尚未完畢，但申請並不因合約規定而停止經費。後來我們一算，到工作完畢，尚可剩二千餘元，乃自動通知申報停止付款這　餘的二千元，也捐給了中國地質學會。由此說來，上面的傳說，也未始無蛛絲馬跡之可尋了。</p>
<p>申報地圖的成就，不能不說是它的得天獨厚。一個事業的成就，不僅要得機會，還需而領導者得人，工作者努力。翁詠霓先生在中華民國新地圖序文裏，開卷就說；</p>
<p>「……丁文江先生創其計劃，申報諸君助其成功，……參考材料，大半藉助於地質調查所圖書館歷年之所收藏，余不過從旁參贊而已……」</p>
<p>「從旁參贊」這幾個字，無疑是謙遜的說法。實際上，他是始終熱心站在指導的地位。許多詠霓先生的舊友常說，他在地質調查所方面，事無巨細，靡不躬親。但筆者參與申報地圖編製工作時，除了編製的方針，事先請敎外，其餘技術方面，以及日常事務，並不去麻煩他。譬如說經費的開支，一開始將原則規定以後，筆者沒有想到應當每月去請示，也無人來過問，這樣省了許多機關式的表報工作，各方都得騰出工夫來做有益的事。但即至今日，遇有有關學術的問題，他還是親臨指導，遇到需要他帮助的事情，他也樂於親筆寫信或起稿，鼓勵我們。</p>
<p>申報地圖發行以後，因爲中外學術界的鼓吹，　起各方的重視，而坊間互相仿效起來。仿效不僅限於地岡的內容，且更見於封面的設計及圖冊的名稱。此種商業化的行爲，本不值提出，但其中右關係學術，不容　默下去的，略舉數例於下：</p>
<p>地形分層設色，原爲小比例尺圖上尋求醒目方法的一種，甚少用於中等或大比例尺的地圖，乃見某種大比例大城市　上，將附　的邱陵，分層設色，本來一幅很簡單明瞭的地形圖，弄得非驢非馬。又如省區的面積，迄今仍無精確數字，乃於戰前讀某種地圖的說明，其所舉面積數字，無一不與筆者在申報月刋發表的數字相同，亦無一不於最末一位，更易一字。一個五六位的統計數字，要在頭上四五位元全相同，而僅差最未一位，來表示另有原委，這是不可思議的事。我們從事編製申報地圖的目的，本是推行我們的見解，故於坊問諸圖的仿警仃爲，一向取不干涉態度，對於統計式的數字，更希望有人引用。</p>
<p>日人小川琢治說：中國地岡向來由日人編纂，送到中國印刷，「中華民國新地圖」却由中國人編纂，送至日本來印刷，　爲是我國在圖學上的進歩，我們却認爲是一種侮辱。爲什麼不能自己印刷？，所以中國分省新地圖，就在上海托中華書局承印了。後來詠霓先生告訴我，吾友吳半農兄說起，有一次在美國某一會議席上，親自聽到前海軍部長貝克君於說明他對於中國進步的觀點，舉　其　　之中華民國新地圖作證，譽爲中國進步的表現，與會諸人，莫不興奮，但經前滬江敎授克萊賣指出，係由日人印刷，衆人鬨堂大笑起來。所以筆者於前年在美國發起組織中國圖書出版公司，後來因登記名稱重複，改稱華夏圖書出版公司，並鑒於印刷工廠的絕難做到萬能，決定先由印圖開始。希望完全由國人工作，出版一本够得上國際標準的地岡。此次出版的中國分省新圖戰後訂正本，即由該公司的印刷工廠承印，雖然是一個處女作，成續還不差。希望他們能够在印岡方而，精益求情，能媲美瑞士或者德國印製的地圖。</p>
<p>中國地理上龍脈蜿蜓的說法，由來已久，申報地圖取消了「筆架式」的表示以後，敎學方面觀念一變，這不能不歸功於地理敎學上的勇於改進。因爲地形分層設色方法，在歐美早已採用，在君先生說：「我們三人都不是地理專家，都不是中學敎員，不過懂得地圖，測過　過地岡」，當時大胆的嘗試了這個方法，圖後旣宋附表解，圖外亦無敎授法，正恐敎育方面認爲生疏，不加採用，豈知却正適合了敎授的口胃。</p>
<p>我們現在正從事另一新圖的編纂，這也許又是一個嘗試，中國地質學會的方俊先生將另有說明。這項工作是由申報預付版稅來支持員司薪支及材料的開支，但實際上因爲預付的版稅，將來並不計利息，幣值日貶，一年以後，九將所值無幾了。當時筆者請方先生來共同工作時，適當某部計劃設立一個研究所，請他去主持。筆者勸他不如來做這個小事，至少可以做出一些成績，方先生當時接受了。現在，這個新圖原稿果已入成完竣了。（三七·六·二十一於南京）</p>

<h3 id="c126">「楊妹狂」 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>近來楊妹的事，鬧得天翻地覆，而且上海也有楊妹，寗波也有楊妹，上海人所謂一窩風，在此種事情上面也表現無遺。在科學上講，固然是值得研究，然而研究了這麼多天，到底有什麼結果？即使有結果，能否使中國四萬萬人都辟穀長生？在國事　　的今日，我感覺這簡直有點近於玩笑，然則與其說是研究，母寗說是「好奇」了。</p>
<p>漢書五行志，專記非常的天變人變，本來中國自古有天人一致的見解，以爲人事可以上感天心，而天垂象所以示不吉凶，故春秋特別重視日食隕星，以爲是非常之變，五行志中這些事更是不一而足，水旱冰雹，黃龍，瑞草，靈芝，實鼎，一產三男，枯木自生，死人復活之類，充塞篇幅，可以充分代表漢儒的險陽五行思想，大約像楊妹這樣的事，一定曾收入志中，只是究當視爲禎祥還是看作妖孹，可眞不易判定；因爲若勉强解作禎祥，米價是這樣漲，戰火是這樣凶，好像興實際太不符了，若看作妖孹呢，我們又有不忍言者！幸而如今已不是陰陽怪氣的時代，大家是在研究，不是在定吉凶，倒也不必追究。</p>
<p>中國古詩，有「服食求神仙，多爲藥所誤」的話，漢武泰皇，那樣英明獨斷，免不了感受生命的威脅，非得派童男女入三仙山，建承露盤，合金丹藥，從造化手中奪取有限的壽命不可，這所謂「不食人間烟火」，是成仙作祖的第一步。不料古代聖王求之而不得者，如今却竟實有其人，張良若在，豈不要拜之爲師嗎？然而事實勝於雄辯，方士大丹終於不能奪命，唐代的末期帝王，幾無一人不是餌丹藥以死，今人之豔羨楊妹者，萬一不幸而存有此種妄念，是應該猛省的了。</p>
<p>這種推想也許是神經過敏，姑不其論；另外一個動機，便出不了解決民生問題。吃飯延長生命，在今日科學家的能力之下，還不能加以否定；米價誠然太貴，生活也眞困難，可是責任不是因爲人們食量增加或是吃飯的人數量增加，而另有其實際的原因；寗波·常州·重慶都鬧搶米風潮，人人都在心神不定，尤其是重慶，絕不會因爲有楊妹的研究作保證，米價便停住不漲。好像以搶米的數量來比較，軍慶倒反而比較別處更大更凶，這不又是一個諷刺嗎？</p>
<p>然後再說好奇。奇人奇事，確可以使人驚異惶惑，可是目下的奇事未免太多，也許是司空見慣渾閒事，居然沒有一個人把他當作奇了。這是什麼？就是每天在漲的物價。遍查歷史，古今中外可曾有過一千幾百萬一石的食米嗎？可曾有過幾百萬一尺的布疋嗎？「萬」之一字，在十數年前，是我們齊民黔首永遠用不到的，即用，也不過形容詞罷了，如今呢，我們聽到市塲上的消息，也不過搖搖頭嘆口氣而已，絕不會像研究楊妹那麼煞有介事的誇張。楊妹即使九年不食，也僅是極少數的特例，比不上這物價的瘋狂，如海濤，如暴風雨，任何人都難躱閃。所以，我希望當局不必唯怪之欲聞，還不如多研究一下大餅油條的價錢與大小，多計劃一下流亡的撫輯與救濟，實在比把精神貫注到這一方而更有用些。况且，有一個敎訓，我們尤當記取，便是抗戰以前山東當豪梁作友詐欺我們行政院院長的故事。這種年頭兒，我們不能完全以君子之腹，度小人之心，—雖然我們也不見得多麼君子。不信請看上海的楊妹，不是業已見首不見尾了嗎？</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>室內養金魚之缸，以宜興出品爲最，惟自抗戰以還，余屢託友探詢，據說宜興審已無新貨應市。或改用木桶亦得，木桶養魚，平津盛行，須注意者，即口寬暢，受陽光足則可矣。其他磁缸，凡口暢底平者均可。室內供魚，用玻璃缸之大號者，僅可作片時之供養。</p>
<p>盛水更換，須視水分天氣而定，如果魚兒不上水面喞喞噴沫，能安居缸底，可不必換，水換得過勤，魚身能起向點，即受病矣。</p>
<p>角在缸中，一缸可放幾尾，茲有一比例，凡一寸長魚四尾至六尾，可在徑一尺的缸中飼養，超過此比例，則水中養分不够，魚兒即要浮面不寗，非換水或分缸不可。</p>
<p>飼食以每大晨問爲最相宜，日僅可給一次，以餵飼活水蛆後，在一小時內吃盡爲最上。如多給而它吃不盡，在給食後二小時後即須設法去除之，因春·秋·冬三季，多給食吃不盡尚無大礙，若在夏令，則水蛆易死，水易變臭，而魚亦受不住，因水壞而致魚死，比比也。至於水蛆有時無從覓處，可代以粥粒，惟以先去除粥粒之膩液，然後放下。他如水藻（俗名狗尾草）它也愛食，惟亦以少給爲是。</p>
<p>井水，自來水，天落水，均可養魚，以質潔，勿臭，而含有氧氣爲要。</p>
<h3 id="c128">小鎭一日 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>對都市發生了疲倦的人們，往往憧憬於鄕居的樂趣。淸靜的環境，素樸的生活，頗能緩和緊張的神經。筆者就在這樣的心境下，乘週末例假，在故鄉M鎭上盤桓了一天。</p>
<p>M鎭是坐落在一處風景區內。那裏，收拾得一塵不染的廟宇，選用原料與烹調手腕俱臻上乘的菜看，嚼來不膩口的棗泥蔴餅（據說以一家在斜橋堍的喚做乾生元的糖食號，開設最久，製作最精）等都很有名。這一切，我都知之有素。我却承不久前在我家中修繕房屋的一家水木作主人楊君的好意，到他的家中，小作勾留。</p>
<p>楊君的寓所，是自置的產業。穿過刷着黑粉的墻門間，是一個小院落，接着是三間正屋。後面再是一個用水泥澆成的天井。這以後還有一個園，從園的一扇後門推出去，更有一處兼作數用的大園子。</p>
<p>大園子的一隅，種着一叢竹子，覆在圍着石欄杆的半圓形的的樹蔭下，水池中反映出重重的說在楊君承購這屋子前，園子中不時有穿了馬蹄袖的鬼魂在晚上出現。理智告訴我決無此事，言者諄諄，却使我半信半疑。</p>
<p>園子的另一隅，在木槪欄中，養了三頭綿羊，冲着人　　的呌着。我在地上想找一些雜草給它們吃，偏地只有開着白花的野生的益母草。據說這是有苦味的，者熱加黃糖後，即俗稱「苦草湯」者是。但是我走到綿羊的身旁，它們却甘之如飴。</p>
<p>我再走到大園子的後面，打開後門一看，正是阡陌縱橫的一處田地，說是專收租米的「棧」上的，一個穿了短衣的農夫，捲起褲子，路在水深齊膝的泥漿內，趕着一頭茁壯的牛在犂田。聽說，沒有種田經驗的人，兩腿沒在泥淖內，就無法動彈。</p>
<p>M鎭的表面，像過去一樣的平靜，安詳，與樸實。但是物價的波動，同樣在人們的心田上攪起了不小的波瀾。一千萬元的限價米，還只是些黃糙米，猪肉價却意外便宜，每斤只售二十萬元，較上海便宜三分之一以上。這是有幾種原因的。第一，近來幾天農家的穀麥等都已售完了，等着要錢用，不得不忍痛出售。第二，餵給猪吃的豆餅等猪食，漲起甚多，有些養猪的農民，頗有不勝負擔之苦，只好乘早宰去了。</p>
<h3 id="c129">小雨點 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>

<h3 id="c130">變戲法 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>「窮則變」已經耳熟能詳了，且看怎樣「變」法。</p>
<p>「變」是一種有方向的動作。因之，往好的方向變去便可以打開「窮」境，所謂「變則通」；否則，旣沒有摸着「窮」的癓結，却亂變花樣，其結果便祗有反而把弱點暴露了出來。</p>
<p>譬如說，米價飛漲，當局便採取了拋售的措施，這是從不管「變」到管。繼之以限價，自然也無可非議。接着，大概因爲米市太穩定了罷，又取消了限價，又是一變。無巧不成書，限價一取消，却正好來了個大漲風漲到七百萬，八百萬，九百萬，一千萬了，却又要限價了，就限一千萬，又是一變。不到一個禮拜，忽然說又不要限價了，結果是白粳限價取消，秈米要有限賈了，又是一變—不過這一變中却有一個特徵，原來米的品質雖有不同，限價的數字倒仍舊是一千萬。</p>
<p>可謂善變者矣，然而米價却以「不變應萬變」，隨便你來什麼花樣，牠總是：漲！</p>
<p>再變下云，秈米的限價也可以取消了，到那個時候，爲了「减輕本市大多數消費者生活負擔一起見，應當實施苞米限價樹皮草根限價了罷？</p>
<p>「變」來「變」去，其如這種「戲法」祗能騙騙小孩子何！</p>

<p>自淸未接受時代文明，大開風氣，報業漸興，以至民國之初，發展倍速。有一口號謂之「有聞必錄」，並無正確根據，而人云亦云，衆口成碑，嚴如信條。近二三十年，報界進步，新聞學家又詳愼考究，彙集中外專家，於「新聞」News樹立精當之定義，並將「有聞必錄」改爲「有聞必察」，聽到一種消息，必儘可能的調查其詳情與眞相。有了一新聞價值」News　Value，乃成其爲「新聞」，現在已成爲極普遍之常識，而在彼時，則文人主報，一切茫然，大多數暗中摸索。草創時期，亦無怪共麻麻胡胡。</p>
<p>彼時報界所信奉之「有聞必錄」，有人說舊時之御史們的「風聞言事」，可以援例，而實則似是而非。</p>
<p>御史稱爲「言官」，又呌做「朝廷耳目」，關於內外大小官史之貪污非法行爲，旣有所聞，即可上奏彈劾。上頭另派大員查辦，查實了，就把被劾的人懲處。如所奏全虛，近於捕風捉影，被彈劾者無罪，彈劾者亦無罪，除非御史有事前受賄或持摺訛詐的凟職劣行，照例辦罪，不是因爲他說話不實而辦罪。（言官偶有措詞太過或不敬而受處分者，那是特別情形，是例外）。</p>
<p>新聞記者職在立言，所謂「輿論」，又彷彿當年之所謂「淸議」，故在一種立塲，頗似當年之言官。言官的話縱然失實，亦不爲罪，一則以糾彈爲本分，二則他們的「言」只是參考的資料，須經別方面之查辦覆奏，裁決是非，並非即以其言爲定論。新聞記者亦復如是，批評儘可能的求其平實，記載儘可能的求其確當，自然頂好，即便有些學識不够，感情用事，對於時事及要人有過火之語（像從前的御史參摺，往往肆意抨擊，使被劾之大員看了不堪其辱），只要問心無他，亦沒有私罪（即凟職一類）。所不同者，御史的奏摺，是直接送達「大內」，由內派員查辦時及查覆之奏摺及上諭明白宣布，是非虛實，只刋於所調黃皮京報，印刷極劣，乾燥的文件，只少數官員購閱，並不普及士民。故被彈劾之情節縱然虛誣，而本人之名譽在社會上並無多大影響。現代報紙則不然，並非少數官員之讀物，乃以社會多方而大多數讀者爲對象，一經誣衊，印象已普，損失超乎形迹，故「有聞必錄」斷不能與言官之「風聞言事」相提並諭，不能引以爲例。（彼時又有「紀載若虛，可以更正」之流行語，固是一法。但「如自染皂」之古訓，亦不可不知。）</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] According to a dispatch from the Military News Agency in Xuzhou on the 23rd: The National Army's powerful western advance force has been clearing obstacles in its path for days, attacking the enemy's flanks and rear. The central column captured Minquan in one fell swoop on the 21st, with the remnants of the bandits fleeing south. The right-wing forces have already crossed Yejigang (east of Neihuang) today, and the left-wing forces are advancing on the bandits in the Zhaolaojia area northwest of Liuhe. At the same time, the Lu-Xi pursuit force is fiercely suppressing the fleeing bandits in the northeast of Lanfeng, and also dispatching troops to advance on the periphery of Kaifeng.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] According to a dispatch from the Military News Agency in Zhengzhou on the 23rd: National Army forces on the outskirts of Kaifeng are launching a capture campaign. Chen Geng's 9th Column has been repeatedly attacked by the National Army's eastward advance forces in the area between Baisha Town and Zhongmu in recent days, with approximately 2,000 bandits killed. During the tense Kaifeng battle, Chen's Guangdong Columns, the Rapid Columns, and Liu's 1st and 11th Columns all drew main forces to reinforce the outskirts of Bian. Chen's 3rd and 8th Columns estimated that after five days and nights of bloody battle in Kaifeng, the bandit casualties exceeded 20,000. At this moment, National Army forces from all directions are encircling the bandits on the outskirts of Kaifeng, aiming to deal a severe blow to the bandit main force and seize the opportunity to clear the situation south of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The Kaifeng siege and defense battle lasted six days and nights. The bandits gathered the 1st, 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns, launching fierce attacks day and night. The National Army, in a joint land and air effort, eliminated more than 20,000 bandits. At noon on the 22nd, having achieved the mission of eliminating bandits, they retreated to favorable areas on the outskirts of the city and continued to cooperate with the powerful air force to strike the remaining bandits inside the city. Part of the bandits were forced to flee south to Zhuxian Town yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Huanghai Squadron flew today to the area of Qixian, Tongxu, and Zhuxian Town in eastern Henan to conduct extensive sweeps. On both banks of the Yellow River north of Bian, they bombed and strafed bandit vehicles, mules, horses, and boats used to loot supplies. The Air Force's East China Unit (Goddess Planes) discovered more than ten bandit ships and over ten vehicles at the Lanfeng crossing of the Yellow River, with more than 1,000 bandits, and immediately launched a fierce bombing. They also bombed and strafed bandits hindering the National Army's advance at Yejigang.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 23rd] The Jinan National Army launched a counteroffensive along both sides of the Jinpu Railway from the evening of the 22nd. By noon on the 23rd, they had crossed Zhangxia, and at 3 PM, they recovered Wande, and are currently continuing their attack and advance.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The siege and defense battle in Yanzhou is still ongoing on the 23rd. Chen's 1st, 6th, and 2nd Columns, and parts of the 3rd and 8th Columns, which fled south across the Longhai Road from southwestern Shandong, and the main force of Liu Neng's 1st Column, have been surrounded by the National Army near Li County and are being annihilated.</p>

Otherwise, if the difference is too great, the burden will be subsidized by the government. However, this kind of expense where the majority pays for the enjoyment of the minority is particularly unfair.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Executive Yuan will submit the national budget for the second half of the year to the Legislative Yuan for review at the end of this month. According to relevant sources, although the total budget for the second half of the year will reach 8 trillion to 10 trillion yuan, the possible rise in prices in the second half of the year has been estimated in the preparation of this budget, so even if prices continue to rise, efforts will be made to avoid further budget increases. In addition, it is learned that the total expenditure for the first half of this year amounted to more than 2 trillion yuan, an increase of more than 1 trillion yuan compared with the total budget for the second half of last year.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When Auditor General Xu Kan attended the political affairs meeting on the 23rd, he specifically proposed resigning from his concurrent position as chairman of the Budget Committee, believing that it should be concurrently held by the Deputy Premier. Zhang Lisheng immediately stood up and said: The Deputy Premier does not have real power, so he cannot hold this position concurrently, and there is no such provision in the Constitution. He hoped that Xu would work harder. Xu then said: If he could not clearly resign, he would submit his resignation in writing on the 24th. After Xu finished speaking, he left his seat. Secretary-General Li Weiguo urged him to stay, but to no avail. In the evening, Weng hosted a banquet at his official residence to persuade him. According to reporters, Xu's reason for firmly resigning from his concurrent position was that the number of times the cost of living for civil servants and teachers this month, as proposed by Xu, was 530,000 times in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, but it was later revised by Weng to 420,000 times, which was dissatisfied by some people afterwards. In order to avoid taking the blame for others, Xu resigned.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] Xia Jinxiong, Li Lixia, and Wang Zhong hosted reporters at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, explaining their mission to Beiping, saying: The main purpose is to study the diversion and absorption of idle capital in the Northeast and North China. A plan has been drafted before the trip, and after consultation with various parties in Beiping and Tianjin, it will be implemented immediately after returning to Shanghai. There are three measures: (1) To relax the standards for remittance and allow cash transportation, the limit of which is about one-quarter of the idle capital flowing south. Li estimated that about 400 billion yuan flows to Shanghai every day. (2) To transport a large amount of grain, cloth, and sugar to the north for sale based on the needs of the north. Some have already been shipped. (3) To issue short-term treasury bills, using high interest rates close to the black market to absorb idle capital. 10 trillion has been sold in Tianjin. The flow of idle capital from the Northeast into the pass will be dispersed as much as possible to avoid causing trouble exclusively in Beiping and Tianjin. The rumor that they came north to prevent the southward flow of idle capital is absolutely not true. The three are scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 25th, and after researching with various parties, they will fly to Shenyang if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="e27">On Rumored Currency Reform <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Zai Shiyun</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, the average price level in Kunming and Chongqing was about six thousand times that before the war. When the news of Japan's surrender came, the social psychology changed drastically. Prices in the rear once dropped to three thousand times the pre-war level within a short period; the legal tender, which had continued to depreciate for eight years, actually had a brief moment of appreciation, increasing in value by 50%. This could be considered an important embellishment to the victory of the War of Resistance. Subsequently, the internal turmoil continued and gradually expanded. Tax revenues declined, military expenditures increased day by day, and the phenomenon of currency inflation intensified, with prices rising even more sharply. Counting the time until now, it has only been two years and ten months, less than three years. The wholesale price index in Beijing has already reached more than one million times that before the war. Although the multiple increase in prices in other cities like Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou is slightly lower than in Beijing, the difference is actually limited. Based on this, prices have increased three hundredfold in less than three years, a rate that is alarming. The devaluation of the legal tender has had a very negative impact on the economy and society. Therefore, in order to show a new style, the government has recently indirectly announced that it will reform the currency system.</p>
<p>The rumored plan for currency reform is quite specific at present. The government spokesperson has not explicitly denied it, and has at least publicly stated that the plan to reform the currency system is imperative, with only the implementation date yet to be determined. The content of the currency reform plan generally includes the following points: (1) Restoring the silver standard internally; (2) Adopting a managed gold standard externally; (3) The silver coin unit weighing 0.42 taels (Treasury Standard), with one US dollar equivalent to five silver coins, and each silver coin equivalent to 200,000 legal tender; (4) Planning to recall the legal tender currently in circulation within four months after implementation. A rumored currency reform is so specific, which makes us believe that this is at least a blueprint for a plan that is being brewed. We should discuss it.</p>
<p>First, allow us to explain the statutory ratio problem in the rumored plan. If one US dollar is equivalent to five silver coins, this is a provision for linking the domestic currency with the US dollar under the managed gold standard. In theory, the managed gold standard should stipulate a nominal standard with a certain gold content as a unit for international trade calculation. However, the actual gold-silver ratio fluctuates from time to time. This is because the relative demand for silver has decreased, and the price of silver has gradually fallen in the past. Therefore, the conversion rate of one US dollar to five silver coins cannot be maintained. As for the provision of one silver coin equivalent to 200,000 legal tender, it is even more inappropriate. Even based on June's prices, which are considered to be one million times the pre-war level, one million legal tender is roughly equivalent to the purchasing power of one pre-war yuan. Currently, on the black market, pre-war silver dollars (weighing 0.72 taels Treasury Standard) sell for about 750,000 legal tender. If calculated according to the price level, a silver coin weighing 0.42 taels Treasury Standard should be equivalent to about 580,000 legal tender. If calculated according to the current price of pre-war silver dollars, a silver coin should be equivalent to 420,000 to 430,000 legal tender. Therefore, the provision of one silver coin equivalent to 200,000 legal tender can be seen as either suppressing prices or suppressing the value of silver coins. In fact, most merchants or producers do not have a specific concept of the price of silver, and they may convert prices into the number of silver coins based on the ratio of 200,000 to one, which would result in raising prices. From the above two aspects, it is hoped that this is just a rumor; otherwise, this prescribed ratio is very problematic.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's discuss the rumored currency reform plan. The method of "adopting the silver standard internally and the managed gold standard externally" is actually the managed gold standard currency reform plan proposed by Kemmerer for China before the war. However, the silver coins in Kemmerer's plan are not the standard currency, but only a representative currency or silver subsidiary currency; the actual value of the representative currency is not equal to its face value, and the face value is higher than the actual value. Kemmerer did this in order to avoid the situation where silver coins were collected and melted by the people when the price of silver was high, resulting in a shortage of currency. The currency system rumored to be implemented soon adopts the silver standard internally, stipulates the Treasury Standard weight of the silver coin unit; and because of its connection with the US dollar, the face value of the silver coin is consistent with its actual value. The important difference between this and Kemmerer's plan lies in the domestic price calculation unit: if silver coins only occupy the position of subsidiary currency, then the calculation unit is still based on the managed gold standard unit; if silver coins are the standard, then all calculations are based on silver coins, and the managed gold standard is just a unit for international trade. The latter is equivalent to using both gold and silver currencies, which belongs to the bimetallic standard in the monetary system. The disadvantages of the bimetallic standard are very obvious. The main key lies in the fluctuation of the price of silver. In other words, the instability of the world silver market will affect the instability of our currency system. Whether the price of silver decreases or increases, it will have an adverse effect on the country. Of course, the cheapening of silver can increase export trade; the more expensive the silver, the greater the purchasing power abroad. The advantages and disadvantages seem not to be generalized. In fact, in terms of the nature of currency, value must be stable; the stability of currency value is also the relative stability of prices. Therefore, in addition to the managed gold standard, it is not appropriate to adopt the silver standard domestically. In principle, it is better to adopt a simple managed gold standard, and silver coins should only occupy the position of representative or subsidiary currency. In addition, there is another point related to this issue, which is the difference between the managed gold standard and the foreign exchange standard. Strictly speaking, the rumored currency system belongs to the foreign exchange standard rather than the managed gold standard. Because, although the managed gold standard does not necessarily require the minting of gold coins for circulation, it must stipulate a nominal standard containing a certain amount of gold; the foreign exchange parity is determined by comparing this gold content with the gold content of a certain country's currency system. Nowadays, the domestic silver standard currency is directly linked to the US dollar. In the future, the fluctuation of the US dollar value will directly affect domestic prices, which will add an unstable factor to the currency system. Therefore, in principle, the standard of the rumored currency system is also problematic.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to talk about the conditions for reform. In the current situation, the problem in this aspect is more important than the previous two. As discussed in the first paragraph, prices in my country have increased 300 times in less than three years, and the currency value has depreciated so much. The basic reason is that the government's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and printing banknotes is used to replace financial revenue; the latter is due to the continuous expansion of the civil war, the disruption of transportation, and social unrest. If these two basic factors cannot be eliminated, currency reform is meaningless. The currency system we are currently using is not a bad system, but the government's improper use of it. In particular, the mistake is that the fiscal policy and the monetary system are not distinguished, and the currency that is related to the country's public and private economic activities is regarded as a fiscal tool. Prices were relatively stable two or three years before the war, which is enough to show that the recent price problem is not the fault of the monetary system. In the future, if the war does not stop, it will be difficult to improve production and transportation, and materials will inevitably be scarce; if the government's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and expenditure still exceeds revenue by a large amount, even if the currency system is changed and a large number of silver coins are minted and used, the price problem will still exist. People certainly have confidence in silver coins with real value, but, precisely because of this, people will inevitably hoard them as much as possible. At the same time, the government's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be offset, and the amount of silver is limited. The government will inevitably issue convertible notes. As a result, the trend of hoarding silver coins will expand, and the actual value of the convertible notes will inevitably decrease. After twists and turns, the government will eventually be forced to abandon the silver standard, currency will continue to inflate, and price increases will be repeated. Therefore, if the conditions for currency reform are not sufficient, currency reform will be in vain.</p>
<p>In short, in order to save my country's economic crisis, the currency system must be reformed. However, in reality, it may not be possible at present. The most important thing is to first have the conditions for reforming the currency system, and at the same time, study a currency system that is in line with national conditions and is targeted at the international environment.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Strange or Not Strange; A Five-Year-Old Boy He Chunzu "Gives Birth" to a "Love Child"; Surgery Performed at Nanjing Central Hospital <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] A five-year-old boy had a caesarean section at the Central Hospital in Nanjing on the 23rd, two years after becoming "pregnant", to remove a 5-inch-long male infant, becoming a world-shaking wonder. However, when the reporter interviewed Dr. Wu Zaidong, director of the Examination Department of the Central Hospital, on the 23rd, Wu explained that the factors for the boy's pregnancy should include the following three points: (1) After conception, cell division and development, sometimes a part of the cells suddenly remain in the body of another developing fetus, which makes the retained cells grow in the body at any time after the fetus is born and grows up, and become deformed. (2) If several organic cells remain in the abdomen of another fetus within one month of conception, they will become a monster after biochemical changes. (3) Twins, but after division, one becomes a formed infant, and the other becomes a parasitic fetus in the body, which may cause two feet to grow on the two arms, or a tumor to grow on the two hands, all of which are abnormally developed twins. The boy in the Central Hospital today may belong to the second category. Wu instructed the reporter to visit the boy's "love child" during the explanation. At first, only a fleshy ball was seen. The reporter thought it was strange. Then, Dr. Wu turned it over and immediately saw the objects hidden in the foreskin, with two feet, toes, a very small number of hairs, and teeth. Two intestines also grew, but hair only grew on a small piece of meat, and there was no shape of head, face, or body. In the eyes of people outside the medical field, it is not enough to recognize the shape of the fetus. The strange cell relies on the blood of the five-year-old boy to absorb nutrients. The boy is from Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, named He Chunzu. The boy discovered a hard mass in his abdomen when he was two years old, and it has been three years. The reporter specially visited this "postpartum male mind" on the 23rd. His face was yellow and black, his eyes were big and dull, and he was afraid when he saw strangers coming and being photographed. The abdomen is being bandaged. His mother is a young woman in her thirties, taking care of him by the bed. The boy has recovered to a normal state and will not affect his growth and development.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd] The entire province of Fujian has recently suffered severe flooding. According to the brief reports received from various counties in the past few days, more than 40 counties have been affected, which is the most seen in a century. Nearly 30 cities in the Min River basin have been affected, and at least 10 in the Jiulong River basin have suffered the same severe disaster. Houses everywhere have been reduced to ruins, people and animals have died, and fields have been flooded. The magnitude of the loss will be astronomical and cannot be estimated at present. In addition to Fuzhou, the counties that have reported disasters to the province and requested assistance include Yong'an, Shaxian, Lianjiang, Minqing, Gutian, Changtai, and Linsen. Jingshan, Fenggang, Shuanghu, and Xiaonan townships in Linsen County suffered the most severe losses, with 80% of the early rice harvest lost and 50% of the late rice harvest lost. The dikes along the river in Tongyu and Jiufeng townships were completely washed away, and the water submerged the roofs, and livestock were also extinct. The flood in Lianjiang County reached three feet high on the evening of the 18th, and all fields and houses were washed away. The flood in Yong'an entered the city on the 17th, and the entire city became a swamp. The severity of the damage in Shaxian has not been seen in 70 years.

<h3 id="e39">Will Japan Become the Arsenal of the Far East? <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>Wu Jiatang, the director of this newspaper's interview room, recently returned from a trip to Japan. He presents his observations and experiences, with the first installment already published in this newspaper's special commentary yesterday. Starting today, the second part will be serialized on page two. Mr. Wu's trip was brief, and his findings are limited. He only expresses his personal impressions and feelings. However, his objective reporting may assist those concerned about the political situation in Japan. We hope readers will pay attention. (Editor)</p>
<p>The argument that the United States is supporting Japan to become the arsenal of the Far East has been widely circulated. However, after the reporter personally went to Japan for investigation, he deeply felt that this view cannot be established based on very basic military common sense. Because if the United States has this intention, its only hypothetical enemy must be the Soviet Union. However, once a war breaks out, Japan is on the front line. The Soviet Union can arbitrarily use its powerful aerial power to destroy the arsenal established by the United States in Japan at any time. Therefore, the United States will never be stupid enough to not even think of this point, and will put the arsenal and wartime production mechanism on the front line. From this, we can understand that this statement is just a deceptive talk, or it has other hidden meanings.</p>
<p>The argument of developing Japan into the arsenal of the Far East is just a clever propaganda with a definite goal. They hope that the Allied Headquarters will be pressured by world opinion, so that it cannot change Japan's production level to the minimum level of self-sufficiency. Furthermore, their conspiracy is to accelerate the collapse of Japan's entire economy. If this can be realized, the Japanese Communist forces will take the opportunity to infiltrate and make Japan completely communist. In fact, this is the Soviet Union's basic plan for the world, in China, Czechoslovakia, and Japan, it is the same. This point must be considered when calmly studying the Japanese issue.</p>
<p>The Allied Headquarters' reconstruction of Japan's economic order is the only way to prevent the communist redification of Japan. We can prove the correctness of its path based on facts. Today, Japan has lost its overseas colonies, and the source of raw materials and the market have also been lost. The population scattered in various places before the war is concentrated on the three islands of the mainland, and the population has become a serious problem for Japan. According to the statistics from October 1, 1945 to February 29, 1948, the population of Japan increased by 7.1 million. Therefore, the Japanese government must, under the guidance of the Allied Headquarters, try to solve the food problem of these more than 7 million people. Japan's food production in 1947 was 13 million tons, and now it must increase by 2 million tons to maintain the minimum food level of the people. At the current rate of population increase in Japan, the rate of food production increase is destined to not keep up with the rate of population increase. Therefore, these 2 million tons of food must be purchased from overseas with foreign exchange. Currently, this batch of food is being supplied by the United States in kind or in funds, and Japan owes the United States 400 million US dollars every year. Not only that, Japan today is also experiencing high prices, and the actual income of the people is decreasing day by day. Taking the price of rice as an example, in February of last year, the black market price of rice in Tokyo was 40.27 yen per kilogram, and by February of this year, it had risen to 130.49 yen per kilogram. The situation is equally serious in the general price level. The price index in March of last year was 137.1, and it rose to 310.6 in March of this year, an increase of more than double.</p>
<p>Under this severe economic situation, if we do not try to improve the general level of production, it is likely to cause social and political disturbances. With the support of the Third International forces, it will eventually cause the arrival of a storm.</p>
<p>When I was in Japan, I compared and studied their industrial production level. The production level in Japan in March of this year was 49% of the pre-war standard. The so-called "pre-war standard" refers to the average figure between 1930 and 1934. The war period after 1937 is not included. 1941 was the peak of Japan's productivity, which was 210.5% of the "pre-war level." Last year's production figure was 40.9%, and it took a year of effort to increase by 9% to reach the 49% level. In March of this year, Japan's textile production was only 21.7% of the pre-war production. The production of cotton yarn in March was 21.4% of the pre-war level. The output of silk in the same month was 16.9% of the pre-war level. The output of cotton fabrics in March was only 26.7% of the pre-war level, and the production figure of rayon fabrics was only 19.4% of the pre-war level. In the metal industry sector, the output in March of this year was 50% of the pre-war level. The output of pig iron in March was only 42.9% of the pre-war level of 1930-1934, while the production level on the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident reached 338.3%, and it also reached 184.7% during the Lugouqiao Incident. The output of refined steel in March of this year was 48.9% of the pre-war level, while it reached 287.3% at the peak in 1943, and it also reached 213.1% in 1937. In fact, if calculated in tons, Japan's current steel production is still far below the limit of the Far Eastern Commission. Japan's current annual steel ingot production is 1.5 million tons, and the maximum limit of the Far Eastern Commission is 3.5 million tons. In the chemical industry sector, the production index in March of this year was 60.3% of the pre-war level; if calculated in tons, it is also far below the limit of the Far Eastern Commission. For example, this year's sulfuric acid production in Japan is estimated to reach 1.94 million tons, while the limit of the Far Eastern Commission is 3.5 million tons. This year's caustic soda production is estimated to reach 96,000 tons, but the limit of the Far Eastern Commission is as high as 630,000 tons. This comparison of figures should be able to best explain the truth of Japan's industrial level today. As for the accuracy of these numbers, a member of the Chinese delegation to Japan told me: they are generally reliable. These figures can show that Japan's industrial production level is still far from the day of self-sufficiency, and in terms of the current progress, there is no question of constituting a threat. I think the Allied Headquarters' expectation of raising Japan's industry to the standard of self-sufficiency in 1953 is too optimistic. Even if we do our best, I am afraid that the possibility of achieving the goal is very small.</p>
<p>I believe that if the regions that supply Japan with raw materials and markets are trapped in economic chaos and depression for a long time, Japan's industry and the entire economy cannot achieve the goal of stability alone, and may even decline as a result. Even with the efforts of the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese themselves, the progress of the economic situation will be slow and difficult. If US aid is suddenly stopped, leaving a vacuum that China and other Far Eastern committees cannot fill, the situation will inevitably deteriorate. The Soviet Union sees this most clearly. They also know that the Allied Headquarters has no intention of turning Japan into an arsenal. If there were any facts, the Soviet representative would have opened fire at the Far Eastern Committee long ago, but she has not made any statement so far.</p>
<p>As for the Strake-Jones report, it is even more difficult to compare with this. What must be recognized is that these two reviews are "individual reports and do not necessarily constitute the policy of the Far Eastern Commission." Even in the United States, Marshall, MacArthur, and senior officials of the Allied Headquarters may not all agree with the recommendations of the two reports. My statement is not an ivory tower, and there is indeed a factual basis, but it has not yet reached the stage of publication.</p>
<p>It is understandable that the United States sent experts to Japan for field investigation to rationalize the policy of occupying Japan, and its motive is to solve the problem. In a democratic way, this investigation report will inevitably be made public to the member states of the Far Eastern Commission. If these so-called reports and review texts are misinterpreted and attacked once they are published, it is tantamount to encouraging opaque and one-sided actions.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Soviet Union Openly Challenges Western Allies East Germany Implements New Monetary System Announces that Greater Berlin is also Included Four-Power Experts Meeting Ends Late at Night Without Results <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] London, 23rd broadcast: Berlin news, today, Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union launched a fierce cold war in Berlin. After the Soviet Union announced the reform of the monetary system in East Germany, the three Western countries decided to issue new Deutsche Marks in their occupied areas in West Berlin. This situation will allow two different currencies to circulate in Berlin at the same time.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] The Soviet authorities announced: The reform of the monetary system in the Soviet occupation zone and Greater Berlin will be implemented on the 24th. At the same time, they notified the Western occupying powers that they have no administrative, economic or political reasons to stay in Berlin. They must accept the monetary system of the Soviet occupation zone, or they will be subject to economic or administrative sanctions. Sokolovsky's order that the four districts of Berlin must accept the reform of the monetary system in East Germany at the same time is tantamount to a direct challenge to the heads of government of the three Western powers. The heads of the three powers had individually sent letters to Sokolovsky on Monday, stating their firm refusal to recognize Greater Berlin as part of the Soviet zone, or that Greater Berlin must be bound by any unilateral orders from the Soviet side. In this situation, the most embarrassed will be the Berlin municipal government. Sokolovsky has ordered the Berlin municipal government to implement the Soviet price bureau's monetary system reform order throughout the city. However, the heads of the three Western military governments have also notified the Berlin municipal government, instructing it not to comply with the orders of the Soviet authorities, and to implement the Soviet authorities' monetary system reform order in the three British, American and French districts. Sokolovsky's letter to the three Western chiefs stated that due to the monetary system reform implemented by the Western powers in their occupied areas last weekend, the unity of Germany was destroyed. Therefore, the Soviet authorities have also decided to implement the monetary system reform in the entire Soviet area and Greater Berlin. I hope that you will not obstruct the implementation of this monetary system reform in your jurisdiction in Berlin.</p>
<p>Before the Soviet authorities implemented the monetary system reform, the four powers experts met on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss the possibility of implementing the four-power-based monetary system reform in Berlin. The negotiations ended late last night without results. Colonel-General Lukan Zhinei, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Government, then sent a letter to the Acting Mayor of Berlin this morning, stating that the marked Deutsche Marks will be in general use from June 24. From the 26th, old Deutsche Marks without stamps and Deutsche Marks issued by the Allied military government will be prohibited from circulation in the Soviet area and Greater Berlin. Sokolovsky separately sent letters to the British, American and French military government chiefs, saying that the announcement by the British, American and French occupying authorities to implement a separate monetary system reform in West Germany has put the Soviet occupation zone in a difficult position. I have to take measures to protect the interests of the people, the Soviet occupation zone and the economy of Berlin, and prevent the chaos caused by the influx of old currencies from West Germany into the Soviet area. Therefore, I have decided to implement the monetary system reform in the Soviet area and Greater Berlin. I hope that you will not obstruct the implementation of this monetary system reform in your jurisdiction in Berlin.</p>
<h3 id="e41">US, Britain and France Form a Strong Front to Jointly Resist Soviet Pressure The New Currency of East Germany Shall Not Circulate in West Berlin <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] After an emergency meeting at the Robertson headquarters this morning, the heads of the three British, American and French occupation zones decided to reject the Soviet decision to implement the monetary system reform in the Western Allied occupation zones of Berlin tomorrow. Generals Robertson, Clay and Koenig decided to form the strongest possible front to resist Soviet pressure. The three generals solemnly announced that the monetary system reform announced by the Soviet authorities is completely invalid for the British, American and French occupation zones of Berlin.</p>
<p>The authorities of the three districts have ordered all banks and shops in the districts, except for shops selling food and medicine, to close down from the 24th until further notice. The announcement of the three districts also stated that the old Deutsche Marks currently circulating in the three districts will continue to be valid, and all prices will continue to remain unchanged. The German Marks of West Germany will circulate in West Berlin. The prices in the West Berlin area will be temporarily suspended until further notice. Until further orders, the import of currency circulating in East Germany into West Berlin will be regarded as illegal, and those who violate this order will be severely punished. Detailed information on the exchange of new Deutsche Marks will be announced soon. This order was jointly signed by the three commanders-in-chief and broadcast by the radio station in the US military area. No specific date was specified for when to use the German Mark. At the same time, the residents of Berlin are terrified because the "Battle of Berlin" is about to begin. They know that the "economic sanctions" mentioned in Sokolovsky's circular will cause the most suffering to the Germans in the three Western districts of Berlin. It is heard that the new currency system promulgated by the Soviet authorities is also to exchange 1 new currency for 10 old Deutsche Marks. The detailed rules are expected to be announced soon.</p>

<p>[This newspaper] London, 23rd broadcast: Warsaw news, communist authoritative sources here reveal: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the foreign ministers of six Eastern European countries are meeting here today to draft a reply to the six-nation conference in London, saying that it has nothing to do with the International Communist Information Bureau.

<p>[This newspaper] London, 3rd broadcast: Warsaw news, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and its seven satellite countries are meeting here, and the foreign minister of Albania is also present.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] Warsaw Radio reported: The delegations from Eastern European countries arrived in Warsaw today, and three hours later, they held a meeting in the old Polish palace outside Warsaw under tight security. The radio station said that this meeting is the largest meeting of Eastern European democracies.

<p>[Reuters London, 22nd] Warsaw telex, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has arrived in Warsaw. Since yesterday, there have been rumors that the foreign ministers of Eastern European countries have left their capitals to attend a meeting of the Communist Information Bureau somewhere in Eastern Europe, but the meeting place has not been specified. Molotov's arrival in Warsaw confirms that the meeting of the Communist Information Bureau is being held in Warsaw. Diplomatic observers attach great importance to the time when this meeting of the Communist Information Bureau is convened. The communique to be issued after the meeting is expected to condemn the Western allies for destroying the unity of Germany, and will announce the unanimous unity of the Eastern European countries to resist the European Recovery Program. The participation of the leaders of the German Communist Party in this meeting is also worthy of attention. The communist parties of France and Italy are also members of the Communist Information Bureau. The Italian communist leader Togliatti and the leader of the French communist members of Parliament, Duclos, are expected to participate in the meeting in Warsaw. The two have reportedly left Rome and Paris a few days ago.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Soviet Union Uses Veto on International Control of Atomic Energy Program The Case Will be Handled by the UN General Assembly This Autumn <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Lake Success, 22nd] The Soviet Union today used its 26th veto in the Security Council to veto the US proposal to transfer the atomic energy control issue to the General Assembly. The US proposal included the Atomic Energy Commission's proposals based on the implementation of the Baruch Plan. When the Security Council voted on the US proposal, nine countries voted in favor, and the Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against. The Soviet Union's negative vote had veto power. At this point, the Canadian representative suggested submitting the report of the Atomic Energy Commission to the General Assembly. Soviet representative Gromyko opposed it, calling it procedural, but the Canadian suggestion was finally passed at the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Dewey Holds Absolute Advantage on the Eve of the Republican Presidential Nomination The Line Preventing Dewey's Election Has Collapsed <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Philadelphia, 23rd] Among the Republican presidential candidates, Dewey has the highest voice for election. McCormick, the editor of the Chicago Forum, told reporters that unless there is an unexpected one-sided situation, Dewey will definitely be elected.</p>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia, 23rd] The joint front preventing Dewey's election collapsed on the morning of the 23rd, making Dewey hold the victory for the Republican presidential nomination in 1948. But he still has to defeat Senator Taft, who, when meeting with the Ohio delegation on the 23rd morning, still said that he would fight to the end.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the leaders who prevented Dewey's election will still plan to meet on the 23rd and try to work hard. If they cannot produce an open compromise, Dewey will have no opponent when voting on the 24th. Pennsylvania Governor Duff is a strong obstacle to Dewey, but Dewey has broken through his defense line. In the 73 votes in Pennsylvania, he can get at least 28 votes. Many state delegations held primary meetings on the 23rd, and some major delegations may make public their positions. Dewey may obtain valuable votes from them. The effort to unite the strength of Taft, Stassen and Vandenberg to attack Dewey failed in a series of meetings on the evening of the 22nd and the morning of the 23rd, but it is expected that Stassen and Taft will still meet on the 23rd, and other meetings will follow. When the Pennsylvania delegation holds a primary meeting on the evening of the 23rd, there may be new developments in the movement to prevent Dewey's election. If Duff can control a considerable majority, the movement to prevent Dewey will still have a glimmer of hope. If Duff fails, this huge delegation will immediately collapse and turn to support Dewey.</p>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia, 22nd] The competition for the Republican presidential nomination is in full swing. New York Governor Dewey has gained three major advantages today: (1) Persuading Pennsylvania's "darling" Martin to withdraw from the competition; (2) Advising Martin to nominate Dewey; (3) Trying to list Dewey first on the list of candidates at tomorrow's conference. It is also heard that at least four of the nine representatives from Wisconsin who support MacArthur are also preparing to change to supporting Dewey.</p>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia, 21st] Senator Martin (not Speaker of the House Martin) announced on the 22nd that he would give up the Republican presidential nomination and declare that he would deliver a nomination speech for Dewey. This sudden statement will certainly increase Dewey's advantageous position in this competition.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Before US-Soviet Relations are Clear, the Japanese Peace Conference is Postponed Straight Four-Power Opinions Still Differ Greatly <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd] Authoritative sources claimed that the United States has decided to temporarily postpone the issue of convening a Japanese peace conference until the general relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can be closer. Therefore, the US government will not make efforts to convene a peace conference this year. Action for the next year does not depend on Japan, or even other Far Eastern countries, but will depend on the general situation of great power politics at that time. The decision of the US top authorities is based on the following two factors. If the Soviet Union participates in the peace conference, there will be no results. But if the Soviet Union does not participate in the peace conference, it is dangerous. Therefore, the United States is not prepared to obtain a compromise on the procedural difficulties between the United States and Britain. Britain advocates that all related countries participating in the peace conference should have equal status and abolish the veto power of the great powers. But the Soviet Union insisted that the peace treaty should be drafted by the four powers alone, and the veto power should be applied during the drafting. US officials believe that even if the procedures of the peace conference can be resolved, and the United States, China, Britain and the Soviet Union can all agree, the peace conference will still not achieve constructive achievements, or it will cause new frictions between the allies.</p>

<p>[Reuters Tel Aviv, 23rd] Under the fierce fighting between the Irgun warriors and the Israeli regular army, they have occupied the entire coast north of Tel Aviv this morning.</p>
<p>[United Press Rhodes, 22nd] Four Jewish experts have recently arrived here by plane, and four Arab experts arrived on the 21st. UN Mediator Bernadotte is drafting a proposal for consideration by both parties. Mr. Bei declared that he decided to set up a truce monitoring headquarters in Haifa, and he stayed in the mediation headquarters on Rhodes.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 22nd] UN Palestinian truce observers have conducted an on-the-spot investigation into the conflict between the Israeli regular army and the Irgun personnel. The Irgun radio station in Tel Aviv said that when Irgun personnel were unloading weapons from Europe on the coast of Tel Aviv yesterday, they were interfered with by the Israeli army, resulting in several deaths and injuries. However, the Jewish official gazette did not report the details of the conflict. The Israeli Command had known in advance that a ship of the Irgun would dock on the coast of Palestine with weapons, so it had already been engaged in a blockade at the landing site. An Israeli gunboat first met the ship and told it that landing in Palestine would cause serious consequences, but the captain of the ship did not allow Israeli naval personnel to board the ship for inspection. When the conflict broke out, the Israeli army immediately began to be on alert in Tel Aviv, and the government announced that it would suppress any attempt to defy its authority. When the ship unloaded the weapons at noon, 20 Irgun commandos wearing steel helmets forcibly landed on the Tel Aviv coast to establish a beachhead. The landing site was only 50 meters away from the UN office here. They also used loudspeakers to ask the Israeli army not to shoot, but shortly after the Irgun personnel landed, the Israeli army shot. The machine gun in the munitions on the ship then exploded. The apartments and hotels near the coast have been evacuated to prevent danger. The radio report received by the London Naval Department said that the Israeli army was bombarding the munitions ship with artillery fire. The ship was on fire, and the people in the ship wanted to escape to the shore, but were blocked by machine gun fire on the shore. It is expected that other Irgun troops on land may attack the Israeli army.</p>
<h3 id="e50">US Republican National Convention Passes New Foreign Policy Platform: Vandenberg Internationalist Faction Achieves Victory <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 22nd] The US Republican National Convention today passed the foreign policy section of its platform, the main purpose of which is to maintain a "peace of justice," engage in international cooperation, abandon "appeasement," reaffirm its support for a "bipartisan foreign policy," and assist all peace-loving nations in restoring and guaranteeing their political and economic freedom. Its passage is widely regarded as a victory for internationalism under the leadership of Vandenberg. It is noted that the passage of the United Nations Charter, the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the China Aid Act, and the extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in the United States Congress was largely due to Vandenberg's efforts. The passage of the platform also represents a defeat for the conservative faction led by House Speaker Martin and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber. To clearly demonstrate the United States' deep concern for the stability, security, and freedom of other independent nations, the platform includes an item related to China, the original text of which states: "We will foster and uphold the historical policy of friendship toward China. We have a profound interest in maintaining China's integrity and freedom." Republicans are confident in their party's prospects in the general election and invite Democrats to cooperate with them in formulating future foreign policy, avoiding partisan strife in this area.</p>

<p>[United Press, Philadelphia, 22nd] After assuming the position of permanent chairman of the Republican National Convention, House Speaker Martin delivered a speech strongly urging the Democrats to step down first. He stated that if the Republican Party is to further control Congress, it must seize the White House, and he predicted a victory in November. At the same time, he strongly refuted President Truman's attack on the Eightieth Congress as "the second worst Congress in history." Martin, due to his neutral position as chairman of the convention, avoided mentioning his personal ambitions but criticized the failures of the Democratic administration. Martin said: "The Republican members of Congress have done their utmost to give the American people a 'unified and harmonious' government. The bravest and most effective blow the American people can contribute is to elect a Republican president in November."</p>

<h3 id="e53">Seven Cases of Illegal Foreign Exchange and Gold Speculation Uncovered, Involving 139 Businesses; Remittance Funds Reach Over 350 Billion <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Investigation Office, in conjunction with the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade, recently conducted a large-scale inspection of the gold and foreign currency black market and private Hong Kong dollar exchange institutions based on a blacklist. The inspected establishments included 16 businesses such as Cai Mingshan at 160 Zhongzheng East Road. Among them, nine cases, including Zhenchang Jewelry at 452 Hankou Road, Xinkang Pen Shop at 100 Central Building, Central Road, Feisheng Tobacco Shop at 887 Linsen Middle Road, Yingfan Store at 645 Xiafei Road, 142 Hengde Lane, 633 Changde Road, 43 Nanhui Road, Yuanda Store at Room 431, 131 Huqiu Road, and Xu Liping at 288 Dongchangzhi Road, 457 Ningbo Road, were deemed to lack sufficient evidence and are still under investigation. The remaining seven cases, after review by the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Office and relevant agencies such as the Gold Control Bureau, were deemed to be of significant suspicion and have been transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation. According to the Garrison Headquarters' announcement, the related companies, businesses, or individuals involved in remittance in these seven cases, for which evidence has been found, number 139, and the funds remitted by these companies, businesses, and individuals amount to over 350 billion yuan. The list of the seven cases uncovered is as follows: (1) Gantai Flower Shop, Room 421, 160 Zhongzheng East Road, was caught on the spot reporting gold prices and illegally exchanging Hong Kong dollars, with a remittance amount of 5.2 billion yuan. (2) Li Huifeng of Dachang Shop, No. 5, Lane 107, Henan Road, was found to be engaged in gold and foreign currency speculation. The shop's transaction records were detected in advance, and three taels of gold and two gold rings were seized on the spot. (3) Li Kecheng of Sanyu Elementary School, 183 Wujin Road, illegally exchanged Hong Kong dollars. The suspect used teaching as a cover to engage in illegal Hong Kong dollar exchange. Telegrams, remittance receipts, letters, and codes related to the illegal exchange were seized on the spot. (4) He Zhanyun, Room 7, 3rd Floor, 304 Jiangxi Middle Road, illegally exchanged Hong Kong dollars and operated a gauze and grain business without a license, admitting to a single illegal exchange of 2 billion yuan. The individuals and businesses involved in the entrustment in this case include Wang Qingchang, Zhang Tongxing, Cheng Yongming, Xinhua West, Tao Zhenquan, and Chen Xiru. (5) Tu Zijin of Jinshan Company, 190 Beijing Road, ostensibly engaged in the paint business as a cover, secretly engaging in gold and foreign currency transactions. One large gold bar and ledgers of receipts and dispatches related to gold and foreign currency transactions were seized on the spot. (6) Tang Yunzhong, also known as Tang Yaoan and Huang Guocheng, using the alias Tang Yunzhong at 987 North Sichuan Road, engaged in Hong Kong dollar exchange. Letters related to illegal exchange sent from Hong Kong and 82 original and duplicate remittance receipts, totaling 45 billion yuan, were seized on the spot. In addition, 8,221,114,600 yuan in bills were seized.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Three Sessions of the Senate Assembly; Inquiries to Five Bureaus and One Committee Mostly Related to Real-World Issues <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The sixth session of the Municipal Senate held its third meeting yesterday. Starting at 3:30 p.m., the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee first reported on the rice distribution situation. Subsequently, the inquiry began, with senators successively questioning the Police, Social Affairs, Land Administration, Civil Affairs, and Health Bureaus, as well as the People's Food Adjustment Committee. A total of 33 people were involved. The focus of the inquiry was on urgent and realistic difficult issues such as the black market for gold and foreign currency, harassment by economic police, rising rice prices, and the accuracy of the cost of living index. The inquiry concluded at 6:55 p.m., and was extended by half an hour. The directors of the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus provided preliminary oral responses, while the remaining responses were converted to written form. The meeting ended smoothly at 7:40 p.m.</p>
<p>A total of 161 senators attended yesterday's meeting. The deadline for collecting proposals was also yesterday afternoon, with a total of 128 proposals received. Today and tomorrow will be devoted to review meetings by each group. Starting at 9:00 a.m. today, the Finance, Social Affairs, and Public Utilities groups will meet, and starting at 3:00 p.m., the Education, Police Affairs, Autonomy, and Public Works Urban Planning Review Committees will separately review the relevant proposals from each group.</p>
<p>At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, the Secretariat reported that the Senate had dispatched Jiang Hao, Zhu Yiyong, and Cheng Zhong as representatives to participate in the Municipal Government's gasoline meeting on the morning of the 23rd, and that preliminary exchanges of views had taken place, pending submission to the Executive Yuan for review. Subsequently, the Chairman reported that the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Chairman Ren was invited to attend due to the Senate's concern about the people's food situation, and to provide a 15-minute report on the committee's rice distribution methods and policies.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Chairman Ren Reports on the Business of the Adjustment Committee <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Ren's report covered three points: (1) The committee's business. Briefly, the committee, under central government orders, conducted a pilot rice distribution program for four months from March to June of this year. The business was very complex. Taking rice revenue as an example, it reached 2.5 trillion yuan in June alone, averaging nearly 100 billion yuan per day, while the total number of staff was only over 300. (2) The continuation of rice distribution. Starting in July, the central government decided to continue rice distribution. The China Relief Mission approved Shanghai's early use of US aid rice before the signing of the Sino-US bilateral agreement because of Shanghai's good rice distribution performance. In addition, the Ministry of Food also allocated 30,000 tons of brown rice, and continued to purchase from Yangon and domestic producing areas. The rice distribution certificates for July have been distributed to each district yesterday, and citizens in each district can obtain their rice distribution certificates on the 28th and 29th. If the certificates are issued, distribution is guaranteed, and the distribution price will not change within one month. Currently, active planning is underway for sources from July of this year to September of next year to ensure continuous rice distribution. (3) Personally, I still have confidence in the rice distribution system. The fundamental solution is to continue the rice distribution system and increase the amount of rice distributed so that citizens can obtain the rice they are entitled to. Although the rice disposal policy is not perfect, it is at least sufficient to stabilize rice prices in the producing areas.</p>

<p>Regarding the Civil Affairs Bureau, Huang Zhenshi and Chen Peide raised questions: (1) The head of the Baojia system is a public official, with obligations but no rights, losing the balance of affairs. They should have the same right to enjoy the allocation of materials as public education personnel. (2) When will the self-defense force be formed? (3) What is the progress of the cooperative societies being operated by each Baojia?</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Disconnection Between the Cost of Living Index and Prices Is Too Great, and There Seems to Be a Suspicion of Artificial Control <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>At 5:15 p.m., after the inquiry to the Police Bureau was completed, a ten-minute break was taken, and the inquiry to the Social Affairs Bureau began. Those who raised questions included Zhang Zhihan, Zhang Zhongyuan, Wang Zonghao, Fan Xipin, Yan Miaosheng, Fei Shusheng, Ding Shanming, and Zhou Xuexiang. The main points of the inquiry were as follows: (1) The dance hall case has been delayed for nearly five months and has not yet been adjudicated. Can the Social Affairs Bureau open the net and not pursue it further? (2) The president of the oil business association, Zhang Chao, was convicted of oil allocation corruption. Please investigate and reply. (3) The quality and smell of the allocated oil are poor. Please investigate the cause. (4) In labor disputes, if the labor side violates the arbitration after the record is made, they will be detained, but the capital side is not when they violate. Why? (5) Why is the price limit for the hotel industry implemented alone? (6) The labor dispute at the Jianguang Match Factory has been delayed for one year and five months. Why has no judgment been made? What is the inside story? (7) The silverware industry pays taxes according to law. Why can't it resume business? Silver shops in Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin and other places all deal in gold jewelry, but Shanghai alone prohibits it. Why? (8) Why is it difficult to submit business registration certificates through the association? (9) Is the compilation of the cost of living index accurate? The workers' index last month was 337,000 times higher, the staff's index was 280,000 times higher, and the wholesale price index has reached 1.24 million times higher. The ratio between the two is four to one. The cost of living index is too far behind, and I deeply feel that there is a suspicion of artificial control. At the same time, it is said that the mayor should strive for adjustments from the central government for the public education personnel index. (10) Why must household sugar be purchased from designated sugar stores? Can the method of allocating oil and rice be followed in the future, allowing citizens to choose the stores that distribute it?</p>
<h3 id="e58">Doctors Disregard Morality, Attention Should Be Paid to Correction <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Health Bureau, Chu Shun, Fan Shouyuan, Jiang Hao, Yan Esheng, Fu Xiaofeng, and Chen Baotai raised questions, including: (1) Many public hospitals do not save lives without money. Please investigate. (2) A few doctors disregard professional ethics and are irresponsible. Attention should be paid to correction. (3) There are too many employees in the First Slaughterhouse. Can it be reduced? (4) The fees collected by the slaughterhouse are far above the costs required for slaughter. Why? (5) The materials transferred to the Health Bureau after the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ended were for the distribution of patients. Why did the Health Bureau allocate them to the staff of the bureau? (6) During Children's Day this year, the Materials Supply Bureau auctioned off a large batch of moldy candies. Has the Health Bureau paid attention to it? And if mold is found, will it be banned?</p>
<h3 id="e59">Director Wu Is Confident and Has Enough Tolerance; No Intention of Retaliation for the Dance Hall Case <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau replied to the inquiry, saying: I am confident that I have enough tolerance and will never intend to retaliate for the dance hall case. Because workers often cause labor disputes and affect social order when they disagree with the ruling, as an emergency measure, the police bureau had to maintain order first. When the capital side violates, they are sent to the court for review and handling. Admitting that the labor side is not without loss, we should still find ways to seek fairness in the future. I am clear in my conscience about the handling of the American Radiator Standard Sanitary incident. I did not rigidly stipulate that the silverware industry cannot resume business. However, if gold jewelry is sold in the black market and is subject to legal interference, I cannot be responsible. Shops that handle household sugar must pay first and then receive the sugar, which is different from the oil and rice that are received first and paid later. Therefore, there are regulations for purchasing from designated sugar stores, and I will discuss improving the method with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Yu Shuping Responds to Inquiries; Gold and Foreign Currency Case Handled Under Orders <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Director Yu of the Police Bureau was the first to take the stage and give a brief reply. He said: The division of powers between the Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters is currently lacking specific provisions. For more serious gold and foreign currency cases, the central government has ordered the Garrison Headquarters to handle them directly. The Lin Wang and Sanwei cases have been transferred to the special court for handling under the instructions of the central government. The Public Development Warehouse incident is currently being investigated by the Supervisory Commissioner's Office and the District Procuratorate. As a precautionary measure, orders have been issued to all districts to conduct a thorough investigation of the storage of dangerous goods in the district, and to order improvements. Economic police were established based on the Internal Affairs Ministry's Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion Regulations. After the establishment, it can at least prevent prices from soaring. The people in charge of economic police are mostly well-educated and experienced people, and the police officers are all high school graduates and understand economic laws and regulations, so the quality is still high. The Flying Fortress takes its meaning from Flying Squadron, and it does have considerable effect. The Rongjun incident is under the jurisdiction of the military police and the Garrison Headquarters. I have always paid great attention to the discipline of police officers. I have investigated and punished many subordinates after taking office, which shows my determination to rectify discipline.</p>

<p>Starting at 3:50 p.m., the inquiry to the Police Bureau began. Senators Wu Zhengshi, Zhao Junhao, Shao Yongsheng, Yan Esheng, Ma Junshuo, Chen Bogan, Pan Jamei, Huang Zhenshi, Tong Xiang, Wei Yunqing, Xie Dahuang, Yang Fusheng and other twelve people raised questions in turn. The key points of the inquiry are summarized as follows: (1) How is the division of powers between the Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters in investigating and banning gold and foreign currency and opium? (2) Why were the responsible personnel of the Public Development Warehouse incident not sent to the judicial organs for handling? Is there any suspicion of dereliction of duty? And what are the prevention plans for similar cases in the future? (3) Although some large-scale black market gold and foreign currency cases have been uncovered, the result is all bark and no bite. What is the reason? Please announce the handling process of the Lin Wang Sanwei case. (4) Economic police often harass citizens because of searching for black market gold and foreign currency. In the future, for reporting cases, can we secretly investigate first before taking action? (5) Why are the mobile silver dollar stalls on the streets allowed to exist? (6) Some soldiers who call themselves Rongjun harass various shops. Why not investigate and arrest them? (7) What is the legal basis for the establishment of the Economic Police Brigade? What is the benefit to stabilizing prices, and what is the quality of the personnel? (8) Smuggling is rampant in Yangshupu, Zhabei and other districts. It is said that the police officers in these districts collude with local ruffians, and small shops are harassed. Please investigate and rectify your subordinates. (9) In labor disputes, police officers use the opportunity to collude with the capital side and suppress the labor side. (10) Why do the police often turn a blind eye to beggars robbing cotton and miscellaneous goods loaded on trucks?</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Cost of Living Index and Prices Are Like a Tortoise and Hare Race: Director Wu Said the Loss Is in the Rent Standard <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Thirteen is an unlucky number, which has become a convention. The thirteenth seat in the Senate was temporarily vacant at this meeting.</p>
<p>The congress opened until about 5:30 p.m., and each person was given a steamed bun (two). It is said that the Senate sets 280 guests every day. At the fifth congress, each steamed bun was 12,000 yuan, and this time it has risen to 35,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Wu Zhengshi said when questioning the Police Bureau that the end of many gold and foreign currency cases always says that it involves a wide range, and also says that it is related to a certain important person, and as a result, there is often no follow-up. It is really a dragon that sees its head but not its tail, and the big cases have become fish that slip through the net.</p>
<p>Shao Yongsheng questioned that many of the economic police are traffic police. They take the usual skills of controlling traffic lights and run to the stock market and yarn market, saying that they are only allowed to fall, not to rise. Price control does not seem to be that simple.</p>
<p>He also said: The Flying Fortress, as the name suggests, should be flying in the sky, but in reality, it is a few jeeps crawling on the ground, which is purely a new term to be creative.</p>
<p>The New Asia Hotel forgot to put camphor pills in the urinal, and was fined by the police bureau, and the owner must go to the police bureau in person to be interrogated. Yan Esheng said that this is close to harassment.</p>
<p>Everyone said that Shanghai is currently living through the dark steps before the light, but Ma Junshuo said that Shanghai has recently encountered terrible light day and night - that is, the fires that are one after another.</p>
<p>Some police bureaus often have people go to various shops to tell them that they need to "contact" someone when something happens. What is the reason for this? Several senators mentioned it in the inquiry yesterday.</p>
<p>After Xie Dahuang's long series of inquiries, he said that Director Yu is a standard officer, gentle and elegant, which made Director Yu only shake his head and smile wryly.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyuan shouted that now you only need a package of three forts to open a hotel room for a day. If the hotel industry wants to limit prices again, in less than a month, more than 1,000 hotels in Shanghai will have to close down.</p>
<p>The smell of the allocated oil is unbearable. Senator Wang Zonghao, who used to run a mill, said: The smell is like the fresh paint on a dead man's coffin.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to buy large gold bars of ten or twenty in Shanghai, but small people who want to buy one or two taels of gold jewelry have no way to buy them. What is this phenomenon? Yan Esheng strongly argued for the resumption of business in the silverware industry.</p>
<p>Fei Shusheng said that the current cost of living index is a tortoise, and the actual price is a rabbit. The farther you chase, the farther the distance.</p>
<p>In the voices of various Yang sisters emerging one after another, Jiang Hao asked the Health Bureau whether there were people in Shanghai who did not eat, and whether there was an inspection of the price.</p>
<p>Director Yu said when replying to the inquiry that economic police are "doing a lot of work without getting any credit." If the senators think that their existence is useless, the bureau can consider canceling it.</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau claimed to be an honest man, and as a result, he always suffered losses. The reason why the silverware industry in this city cannot resume business is because he is too obedient to the central government's orders.</p>
<p>He said: He is willing to guarantee the absolute accuracy of the cost of living index with his personality. The low cost of living index is due to the fact that the rent standard is limited to 7,000 times, and rent accounts for a pivotal proportion in the cost of living index.</p>

<p>Those who questioned the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee included Chu Shun, Xia, and Lu Yinchu. The main issues were: (1) The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee's work report in March stated that the total number of employees was over 400, which is quite different from the 300 reported by Chairman Ren. So how many employees are there? (2) What are the monthly expenses of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee? (3) What are the expenses for each dan of rice distributed by the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee? (4) Why have rice prices continued to rise after rice distribution? (5) The rice distribution certificate has two-part tickets for allocation and purchase. The purchase part is now completely useless. Why not save it? (6) Where is the rice disposal going? What is the effect of the rice disposal?</p>

<p>Only Zhang Zhongyuan and Jiang Hao questioned the Land Administration Bureau.

<h3 id="e65">Index Compilation; The General Labor Union Suggests Improvements; Reasonable Adjustment of Weights and Quality Should Be Published Every Half Month <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Since last month, the price of goods in this city has fluctuated more violently. The labor unions of various industries in the city believe that the cost of living index in May is far from the price of goods, and they have successively reported to the General Labor Union to accuse them and suggest improvements. After the Cost of Living Index Research Association discussed and submitted it to the 46th Board Meeting, it was decided to discuss various methods to treat this symptom, and officially submitted it to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting adoption and implementation. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Symptomatic treatment: (1) This time, the government generally distributed rice, and the citizens eat 500,000 yuan per dou. The difference between it and the market price is actually a benefit that the government bestows on the people, and workers are also citizens of this city and should enjoy this benefit. However, the cost of living index is calculated at the distribution price, and it is as high as five dou, which is tantamount to deducting the difference in the rice distribution from the workers. Therefore, this household rice distribution is only for people in agriculture, commerce and academia, and workers are not involved. Therefore, it is proposed to calculate one dou according to the distribution price, and the rest according to the market price. (2) Please calculate coal balls according to the market price, because workers have not received the allocated goods, and the cost of living index is calculated at the distribution price, so it is difficult to remain silent. (3) The weekly survey of prices must be improved, because the turnover of prices has been shortened recently, and the fluctuations are very violent, with the market prices being different in the morning and evening. If you want to be fair and reasonable, you should change the survey to once a day. (4) The cost of living index should be changed to be published once every half month, because each factory usually pays wages every half month, so that the workers' income can be used for the current month, and the wages currently paid are calculated based on the index of the previous month. (B) Fundamental treatment: (1) A household survey should be conducted immediately to be practical. (2) The quality weights of the items listed in the index should be reasonably adjusted to meet the actual needs of the workers.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] According to Zhang Yongnian, the Chief of the Jianghai Customs, the go-slow incident at the customs, which lasted for several days, has been formally resolved because all employees have accepted persuasion. Therefore, all work inside and outside the customs has returned to normal. However, according to customs employees, they are not satisfied with the three points of the Standing Committee's reply, especially the request to increase treatment has not been specifically concluded, so they are not very interested in resuming work. Although the customs work proceeded as usual yesterday, the employees' emotions seemed very lazy.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Texaco Kerosene Company workers and the company had a dispute due to issues such as requesting the distribution of kerosene. It is reported that two of the most important points raised by the employees have been resolved: (1) The employees requested that the company distribute three cans of kerosene per month, and the company has accepted it after Mayor Wu's mediation. (2) The company has agreed to weekly holidays, stipulating that employees can take one day off after working six days, and wages will be paid as usual. If they need to work as usual, wages will be paid in parts according to the provisions of the Factory Act. The labor and capital parties will seek to resolve the remaining trivial issues themselves within a few days.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Senators Propose Expanding Stock Market Trading <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>City Senators Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Yiqu, Yao Baozhen, Yu Shun, Yan Esheng, Zhao Junhao, Zhou Chengxiang, Wang Guoxian, Gao Shuan, Zhu Liangcai, and others submitted a proposal to the Senate yesterday, requesting the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, instructing the Shanghai Stock Exchange to strengthen its internal structure and expand stock market trading. The rationale is as follows: It is a well-known fact that the city is awash in idle capital. Apart from the small number of unscrupulous individuals who engage in black market currency speculation and adopt an "escape" abroad, the remainder of this idle capital is invested either in the stock market or in the commodity market. Consequently, holders of idle capital are either buying commodities and selling stocks, or buying stocks and selling commodities. However, weighing the relative importance of the two, it seems that channeling idle capital into the stock market is a better strategy. Directing idle capital to the commodity market can cause prices to rise wildly. For example, after the Gold Control Bureau implemented the policy of not allowing same-day checks to be used as collateral on June 1st of this year, holders of idle capital immediately bought commodities and sold stocks, causing the stock market to decline universally while prices soared. This is one example. Therefore, if the government wishes to stabilize prices and prevent idle capital from disrupting the commodity market, it should immediately strengthen the stock exchange and expand stock market trading to absorb large amounts of idle capital and prevent it from becoming a widespread problem. This proactive channeling is more effective in the long run than the passive tightening of credit.</p>

<h3 id="e78">"Newly Revised Map of China by Provinces" to be Published Post-War <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The "New Map of China by Provinces" published by Shen Bao was first conceived in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic [1930] and the first edition was published in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. The compilers, Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Zeng Shiying, used the latest measurement materials and cartographic methods of the time. After its publication, it was highly praised in cultural and educational circles. Universities and middle schools adopted it widely, and it was repeatedly revised and reprinted. By the 28th year of the Republic [1939], it had reached its fourth edition. Later, due to the escalating war, revision work had to be temporarily suspended, making it difficult to find on the market. Shen Bao, recognizing that the wartime military operations led to a wealth of new information about topography and geography not found in previous maps, and that significant changes have occurred in geographical divisions, including the restoration of Taiwan, the recovery of the Northeast provinces, provincial divisions, the construction of highways and transportation, and the addition of railways and seaports, has made a correct and up-to-date map an urgent necessity. After the victory, Shen Bao commissioned Weng Wenhao, Zeng Shiying, and Fang Jun to re-compile the map based on actual measurement data, with assistance from the National Defense Ministry's Survey Bureau and the Central Geological Survey, and with reference to numerous books. After more than two years of effort, the newly revised fifth edition, named "Newly Revised Map of China by Provinces Post-War," will be published soon. Not only is the content rich and accurate, but the printing is also exquisite, far exceeding pre-war standards. The map is available in both hardcover and paperback editions. The hardcover edition is a 16mo volume with a hard cover, containing 29 sheets of 8vo maps, totaling 39 maps, printed in seven colors on 100-pound art paper, with a glued spine. When opened, it can be laid flat. In addition to provincial maps, it also includes a general topographic map, a general political region map, a map of important mineral distribution, a climate map, a soil distribution map, a map of important cities and population distribution, and a linguistic region map, providing detailed coverage of all aspects. An index of over eighty pages is included at the end of the map for easy lookup of place names. The paperback edition is an 8vo volume with a saddle-stitch binding, containing 16 pages and 35 maps. The paper and printing are identical to the hardcover edition. The only difference is that the hardcover edition is printed on one side of the page, while the paperback edition is printed on both sides. The index is omitted, which saves paper and makes the price more affordable, making it ideal for students.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Zunjia, the 34-year-old only son of two families, was riding his bicycle on Dongchangzhi Road, near Tanggu Road, on the 17th of last month when he was struck by a ten-wheeled truck belonging to the Materials Supply Bureau. The bicycle was destroyed and Lu was injured. He was taken to the hospital for treatment but ultimately died from excessive blood loss. The driver, Gu Shoushan, was handed over by the police to the District Prosecutor's Office. It was discovered that the driver did not have a driver's license, so he was prosecuted for negligent injury resulting in death. Yesterday morning, the Third Criminal Court of the District Court held a hearing. The victim's mother, Lu Cai, who is 60 years old, and his four-year-old son, Zhao Di, who is too young to understand, were represented in court by his wife, Lu Yan, who filed a civil claim seeking compensation. They argued that the director of the Bureau, Jiang Biao, should be held jointly liable for the compensation because he did not exercise due diligence in hiring the driver. The victim's family requested a total of 5 billion yuan for support expenses, funeral expenses, and consolation money. Jiang Biao did not appear in court yesterday and was represented by lawyers Yan Fangfu, Hu Cansan, and Zhao Jintang, who argued in his defense. After the hearing, the court adjourned the case for further proceedings at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Airline Company Case: Four Defendants Required to Pay Additional Bail <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case against China and Central Airlines for allegedly increasing fares without authorization and colluding with merchants for fraudulent purposes was heard for the first time by Judge Lian Zhenbang of the District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday. All defendants except the three who are fugitives and Yan Duzhou were present in court with their lawyers. After confirming their names and origins, they were questioned separately. Liu Anping of China Airlines stated, "Zhou Peiran of Huamao Company was the former director of the Gui Sui office of China Airlines. He was suspended from his position due to suspected smuggling and I have not met him since. Zhou chartered planes from the company using the name of Jinshan Company. The high freight rate of 21,200 yuan per catty was entirely voluntary. As a commercial enterprise, the company was happy to accept it, but I never received any 'benefits.' My role is in the business department, and the allocation of aircraft is the responsibility of the flight operations group. Both Jinshan Company in Shanghai and Huamao Company in Peiping have verifiable addresses." Jiang Nengxiang stated, "The company is a commercial enterprise, and anyone can apply for cargo transportation. The company was unaware that Zhou had increased the freight rate to more than 50,000 yuan outside and solicited passengers and cargo." Xu Xin stated, "The company uses a bidding system, and a higher freight rate is beneficial to the company. The Peiping office was instructed by the Shanghai head office to handle the matter." Xu firmly denied ever refusing cargo shipments from various companies. Finally, Deng Gaozhang of Central Airlines testified that he did not know Qi Nianzu of Dabe Company, etc. Because the company was willing to pay a high price, the company had a profit motive, and the flight operations group also agreed to allocate aircraft for transportation. He then received a telegram from Peiping asking whether to suspend other cargo shipments until Dabe Company had delivered its cargo. Shanghai instructed them by telegram to continue loading as usual, but the price should be calculated at Dabe's freight rate of 21,200 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>At this point, the court adjourned the hearing and instructed the four defendants to read the transcripts, make corrections, and sign them. Furthermore, because the four defendants were suspected of more serious crimes, in addition to the bail already paid to the District Prosecutor's Office, the court ordered Liu Anping and Jiang Nengxiang to pay an additional 2 billion yuan each, and Xu Xin and Deng Gaozhang to pay an additional 3 billion yuan each, in the form of written security.</p>

<p>The special relief donation drive in this city, advocated by the Department Head, has so far raised a total of 616.625 billion yuan, as well as 100 boxes of high-efficiency internal combustion engine parts newly arrived from the United States. In addition to the Mayor's donation of 500 million, Jiang Huaisu donated 10 million, Dao Yousheng donated 500,000, an anonymous donor donated 300 billion, the Motion Picture Producers Association donated 100 billion, the Banking Industry donated 100 billion, Lin Wenji donated 10 million, the Textile Industry donated 300 billion, Gu Qianlin donated 3 billion, the Shangbao donated 100 million, and the Tobacco Industry donated 200 billion. The donations from the industrial and commercial sectors have been relatively substantial, but the so-called wealthy tycoons have yet to make any donations. However, the amount pledged so far is far short of the original target of 8.5 trillion yuan, and the government has stipulated that the special donations from all regions must be fully collected by the end of this month. With only one week remaining in the donation period, the Relief Donation Solicitation Committee of this city hopes that all citizens will actively pledge donations to fulfill their national duty.</p>

<p>The National Bank and the Yarn Control Committee held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon in President Yu's office to review the recent policy of selling off cotton yarn and cloth. The meeting was presided over by Liu Gongyun, Vice President of the National Bank. Wang Lanseng, Gao Bingtai, and Liu Wenteng, the Acting Chairmen of the Yarn Control Committee, also participated. At the meeting, the Yarn Control Committee presented a written report summarizing the amount sold in recent days and the amount of currency absorbed.

<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 22nd] An upset occurred in the second week of the Wimbledon men's singles today. Italian player Cuselli, after a dramatic five-set match, defeated Czech player Trolobergni, the fifth seed who was generally considered to be a potential winner of this year's championship. Trolobergni's elimination has made American player Park's hope of winning the championship even stronger. Cuselli, 32 years old, from Milan, is the Italian national champion. He battled Trolobergni in five sets for two and a half hours, finally winning 6-4, 16-14, 1-6, 2-6, 6-3. Cuselli won the first set easily, and the second set was the most competitive, lasting an hour, with Cuselli still having the upper hand. Overall, Trolobergni performed well, but there were occasional simple errors. Cuselli had the advantage with several net interceptions, while Trolobergni relied entirely on long shots from the baseline to win. Other seeded players advanced smoothly to the third week.

<h3 id="e117">Farewell <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Traditional First</p>
<p>Today I received a notice from the newspaper stating that due to the implementation of reductions in scope and the difficulty in allocating space, the decision has been made to discontinue all seven weekly publications starting July 1st. Therefore, we can only bid farewell to our readers. "Publishing World" has been the longest-running of the weekly publications in this newspaper. This on the one hand shows the spirit of academic promotion of the editorial department of this newspaper, and on the other hand is due to the enthusiastic love and support of readers and writers. This time, due to the limitations of paper and space, it is necessary to stop the weekly publication, which is unavoidable, and I hope readers will forgive the newspaper's difficulties.</p>
<p>This editor plans to go to the United States this summer. On the one hand, I want to enrich my own knowledge and work hard to learn more about Western culture and thought; on the other hand, I will respond to the invitations of several universities there to talk about Chinese academic thought, hoping to make a small contribution to promoting the spirit of the Chinese nation and communicating Eastern and Western cultures. When I was worrying about how to continue the editorial work of "Publishing World," I heard the news that the weekly publication would be discontinued, which relieved me of a great burden.</p>
<p>However, I must express my sincere apologies to the readers of this publication and the gentlemen who contribute. At a time when China's material conditions are poor and there is a famine of spiritual food, general aspiring youths and eager adult learners hope to use various economical methods to satisfy their desires for learning and progress. According to readers' reports, this publication has indeed made a small effort in this area, and we regret that this small effort cannot be continued due to material constraints. This is what we should apologize to our readers for. The country should be even more ashamed of these eager and thoughtful scholars.</p>
<p>The manuscripts of this publication, with the exception of a very small number of specially invited ones, are mostly contributed, and the standard of the manuscripts is generally quite high. This shows that they are all carefully crafted by the writers. We ourselves are also writers, so we cherish them very much. I never discard any of your manuscripts, whether they are used or not. Many manuscripts that I want to use are often delayed for a long time due to space limitations. In addition, the recent influx of submissions has caused us to [missing character] many good articles. Now that this publication is ceasing publication, it is bound to be [missing character], and this is another thing I must especially apologize to the contributors for.</p>
<p>Finally, we have [missing character] a statement regarding many unused submissions. The standard I choose is first the value of the book itself, and second the beauty of the review article. I am confident that it is quite objective. A few of the submissions introduced the editor's own writings and translations. In order to avoid the suspicion of self-promotion, they were not used, and I am deeply sorry. Many readers have inquired about my writings and translations, but I have not replied to them on weekdays. Now I can tell you that my writings and translations focus on philosophy and psychology and are published in Commercial Press, Zhonghua Bookstore, and World Book Company. To find out the titles of the books, please check the catalogs of the bookstores. Thank you for your support, and I will [missing character] you. Goodbye!</p>
<h3 id="e118">Science and Technology <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>By Zhao Zengjue, published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>In his book "Scientific Attitude," British biologist C.H. Waddington divides scientists into two categories: technical experts and those who think scientifically. According to him, technology is included within science; this can be considered science in a broad sense. Recently, I read Mr. Zhao Zengjue's new book "Science and Technology." From its title and content, it is clear that his understanding of science refers to pure natural science, and thus he lists it alongside technology.</p>
<p>Although this book is a collection of essays discussing science and technology, its theoretical framework is consistent throughout. The author believes that if China wishes to compete in the modern international arena, there is no alternative but industrialization. The foundation of industrialization lies in technology, and the foundation of technology lies in science. This is truly an irrefutable truth. He also states that the purpose of technology is "to utilize and enrich life." In other words, the purpose of technology is to serve the "people's livelihood" and "public welfare." The author believes that China's industrialization should be centered on the people's livelihood. Although the author also emphasizes national defense construction, it does not conflict with the construction of people's livelihood, because his defense theory is also centered on the people's livelihood. Obviously, without national defense, the people's livelihood cannot be built. Therefore, we must "buy plows" to build the people's livelihood, and at the same time "buy swords" to build national defense. The British Science and Industry Association is discussing "selling swords to buy plows," but we are different from them because we have no swords to sell, and we have never had enough swords to resist the enemy. Therefore, we have suffered greatly in the past. Today, we must not only buy "plows" but also buy "swords." At the same time, we also need to be able to manufacture our own new "plows" and new "swords." Twenty years ago, Mr. Wu Zhihui said that if others use machine guns to attack us, we should use machine guns to fight them back. Even twenty years later, this statement still holds value. In fact, if those who want to attack others with machine guns are not eliminated, this statement will always be valuable. Therefore, I completely agree with Mr. Zhao's national defense theory. Who can guarantee that we will never face a second major test in the future?</p>
<p>The author not only believes that technology is the foundation of industrialization but also pays attention to the importance of organization and management. Obviously, technology requires "efficiency," and organization and management are ways to achieve "high efficiency." However, organization and management are formal, and the most important thing is to lay a psychological foundation. Otherwise, it is merely a machine, not a living organism, only having a passive effect, and not playing an active role. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to "organization" and "management," the author also pays attention to the cultivation of working mood. Regarding this point, the author believes that an excellent technologist, especially in China, needs considerable cultivation in philosophy, literature, art, and even sports. Only then can they obtain a courageous and vigorous, and lively and happy working mood. This kind of working mood is the psychological foundation of "organization" and "management." The theory is elaborated in the articles in the fourth section of the book, which will not be cited here. We certainly know that both science and technology value specialization, but the success of one field of learning often requires the assistance and inspiration of other fields. Therefore, the vertical development and horizontal development of learning are complementary. If a scientist or technologist only focuses on "specialization," the drawback is that their personality becomes biased, their life becomes monotonous. Edison said that 99% of the success of a career is "hard work" and 1% is "inspiration." This tells us that even with 99% of hard work, if we lack 1% of inspiration, we still cannot achieve 100% success. But this "inspiration" can never be nurtured by a boring and monotonous life. Therefore, Mr. Zhao's emphasis on cultivating working mood is indeed profound.</p>
<h3 id="e119">### Peace? Or Power? <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Peace or Power by H. Butler</p>
<p>Faber and Faber Ltd, London.</p>
<p>Price: Fifteen shillings, totaling 270 pages.</p>
<p>The bloodstains of the First World War have not yet dried, and the crisis of the Third World War is lurking in all parts of the world, with the possibility of breaking out at any time. Therefore, the people of all countries in the world have two urgent questions in their minds: one is how to replace the current "world of power" with a "world of peace"? The other is how to reconcile the conflict between East and West? The solution to these two problems depends on the peace-loving people of the world, using everyone's wisdom to explore the future of the world. Mr. Butler's book "Peace? Or Power?" makes a significant contribution to the solution of these problems. Therefore, it is particularly meaningful to introduce Mr. Butler's masterpiece at this time.</p>
<p>Mr. Butler is a first-class British international commentator. He served as the Director of the International Labor Bureau in Geneva for eighteen years until the League of Nations dissolved in 1938. He then resigned and returned to his country. Therefore, he knows the real situation in European countries more clearly than anyone else. Later, during the Second World War, Mr. Butler was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to go to the United States and was responsible for intelligence work in the Embassy in the United States. He knows the real situation in all countries of the world, and his footprints have been to Canada, South America, and Asia. Therefore, his international papers are not like theoreticians who speculate with ideals everywhere, but a practical diplomat, a commentator. Every word has a factual basis. Especially this book, which he wrote after returning from a trip to Europe in 1946. In addition, he also wrote "The Lost Peace." He has a unique view that he believes that the conflict between East and West today is not entirely a conflict between communism and democracy. The root cause of the conflict still lies in history. Therefore, he argues that the most important task at present is to make the world fully understand the facts that have happened in the past and understand the facts that are happening now. This proposition deserves our attention. The contents of the book are briefly introduced as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1, "The Peace That Failed to Be Made," starts with the establishment of the League of Nations and talks about the process of the outbreak of the Second World War, explaining the international relations within 20 years clearly, and pointing out the reasons for the outbreak of the Second World War.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, "The Cause and Effect of Power," the author witnessed the situation in European countries. Initially, the people of Germany, Italy, Britain, and France did not have the enthusiasm to participate in the war; especially the neutral groups thought that Nazi Germany would definitely abide by international law. Therefore, they believed that their neutrality and peace could be respected, but later they were all invaded by Germany and were involved in the whirlpool of war.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, "East and West," points out that after the collapse of democratic politics in Western countries, anti-democratic ideas in Germany and Italy emerged. The general working class tended to the Soviet Union. Although they did not know the real situation of the Soviet regime, they were skeptical of all the anti-Soviet propaganda from the outside world. If they could choose between fascism and communism, they would rather choose communism.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, "The Hardships of Western European Countries"</p>
<p>Chapter 5, "Germany's Plans," the author believes that the German people are unfortunate. In the recent 30 years, they have encountered two unfortunate disasters. The fundamental reason is that the defeat in 1918 failed to eliminate the German people's warlike mentality. Later, Hitler used nationalism to incite the Germans, which became unstoppable.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, "The Dawn of Eastern Europe," Chapter 7, "The Revival of the Slavs," comprehensively reports on the situation of Eastern European countries after the war. The world has always been unclear about the actual situation of Eastern European countries behind the Iron Curtain. These two chapters are particularly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Chapter 8. "The Soviet Union in Europe" points out that the Soviet Union has been in a leading position in Europe after the war, and all Eastern European countries follow the Soviet Union's lead; Chapter 9, "The Price Paid by Britain for Victory," Chapter 10, "The Inconsistencies of the British Commonwealth" everywhere express Britain's sadness. Today, Britain can no longer maintain its pre-war status in Europe, and all the traditional relations between Britain and European countries no longer exist. Chapter 11, "The American Long Drive In," the author said that although the Soviet Union's power has penetrated deep into the heart of Europe, overthrowing all the old systems on the European continent, the United States has also bravely driven into Europe, resulting in a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, making the fate of European countries more subtle and complex.</p>
<p>The last chapter is the conclusion, Peace? Or Power? The author said with great emotion that although the Second World War has become history, peace has not yet been made. In previous international conferences, the East and the West have always failed to reach a compromise. Therefore, the "different purposes and different ideas" of both sides have become more and more exposed, and the conflict between the two sides has changed from secret struggles to open struggles. It is a great misfortune for mankind. (Page 248) Therefore, the world today is still a world of power. The effort to create peace has failed, and the effort to prevent the United Nations from following the footsteps of the League of Nations has also failed. However, people still maintain a belief that an effective international organization is indispensable to preserve modern civilization. Therefore, the struggle between peace and power, who will win and who will lose, is still uncertain today!</p>
<h3 id="e120">### Random Notes on the Compilation and Printing of the Shenbao Map <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Shiying</p>
<p>The Shenbao maps mentioned in this article include the New Map of the Republic of China, the New Provincial Maps of China, etc., all referring to the maps issued by the newspaper. The compilation and printing of these maps can be said to be an attempt in terms of both technology and career at the time. I only knew how to bury myself in technical work, and I did not consider the consequences of things at the beginning. Even the few advanced figures who launched the plan probably did not have full confidence in this map at the beginning, but only tried their best to do it. Now, let me cite a section from the contract for compiling the New Map of the Republic of China:</p>
<p>"...The above maps shall be owned by the publisher for printing and sales, and the price shall be at least four yuan per volume..."</p>
<p>This clause limiting the minimum selling price can have multiple interpretations. At the time, it was expected that sales would not be too high, and there were concerns about careless printing, so there was this gentlemen's agreement. Unexpectedly, the facts were the opposite. Shenbao, based on its publishing experience, set the price of the New Map of the Republic of China at 25 yuan per volume, and even its abridged version, the New Provincial Maps of China, was set at three yuan per volume.</p>
<p>We all know that Shenbao's issuing land is to commemorate its 60th anniversary, and I have always thought so, but recently someone said that among Mr. Ding Zaijun's friends, they saw his economic difficulties after stepping down as the Songhu Governor, and wanted to give him a sum of living expenses, but they also knew that Mr. Zaijun would not take or give anything. If they said they were giving money, they would definitely be rejected. So they came up with a tactful way to ask him to lead the map-making, but he handed over the funds entirely to me for distribution, truly using it for map-making. It is only up to those involved to say whether this legend is credible, but there is such a clause in the contract:</p>
<p>"The publisher shall pay the author 1,000 yuan on the first day of the ninth month of the nineteenth year, and 600 yuan per month thereafter, until the eleventh month of the twentieth year, totaling 10,000 yuan, as the cost of compiling the above maps."</p>
<p>By the eleventh month of the twentieth year, the compilation work had not yet been completed, but the application did not stop the funding because of the contract provisions. Later, we calculated that when the work was completed, there would still be more than 2,000 yuan left, so we automatically notified Shenbao to stop paying the remaining 2,000 yuan, which was also donated to the Geological Society of China. From this point of view, the above legend may not be entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>The success of the Shenbao map cannot but be said to be its unique advantage. The success of a career not only requires opportunity but also requires the leader to be competent and the workers to work hard. Mr. Weng Yongni said in the preface to the New Map of the Republic of China:</p>
<p>"...Mr. Ding Wenjiang created the plan, and the gentlemen of Shenbao helped its success...Most of the reference materials were borrowed from the collections of the Geological Survey Institute's library over the years. I was only involved in assisting from the side..."</p>
<p>The words "assisting from the side" are undoubtedly a humble statement. In fact, he has always been enthusiastic and stood in a guiding position. Many old friends of Mr. Yongni often say that he personally took care of everything, large and small, at the Geological Survey Institute. But when I participated in the compilation of the Shenbao map, in addition to consulting him in advance on the compilation policy, I did not bother him with other technical matters and daily affairs. For example, regarding the expenditure of funds, after the principles were set at the beginning, I did not think that I should report every month, and no one came to inquire. This saved a lot of agency-style reporting work, and all parties were able to free up time to do useful things. But even to this day, when there are academic questions, he still personally guides us, and when he needs to help us, he is happy to write letters or drafts to encourage us.</p>
<p>After the publication of the Shenbao map, it attracted attention from all parties due to the promotion of academic circles at home and abroad, and other publishers began to imitate it. The imitation was not only limited to the content of the map but also to the design of the cover and the name of the atlas. This kind of commercial behavior is not worth mentioning, but there are some that involve academics and cannot be kept silent. I will cite a few examples below:</p>
<p>Topographic layer coloring was originally a method to seek eye-catching on small-scale maps and was rarely used on medium or large-scale maps. However, it was seen on a certain large-scale city map, where the attached hills were colored in layers, making a very simple and clear topographic map look like neither a donkey nor a horse. For another example, there are still no accurate figures for the area of provinces and regions. However, in the description of a certain map read before the war, the area figures cited were all the same as the figures I published in the Shenbao Monthly, and without exception, the last digit was changed. It is an incredible thing that a statistical figure of five or six digits can have the first four or five digits all the same and only differ in the last digit to indicate that there is another origin. Our purpose in compiling the Shenbao map was to promote our views. Therefore, we have always taken a non-interference attitude towards the imitations of other maps, and we hope that someone will cite statistical figures.</p>
<p>Japanese scholar Ogawa Takuji said: Chinese maps have always been compiled by the Japanese and sent to China for printing. However, the "New Map of the Republic of China" was compiled by the Chinese and sent to Japan for printing, which is a progress in cartography in our country. However, we believe it is an insult. Why can't we print it ourselves? Therefore, the New Provincial Maps of China was printed by the Zhonghua Book Company in Shanghai. Later, Mr. Yongni told me that my friend Wu Bannong mentioned that he personally heard former Secretary of the Navy Baker explaining his views on China's progress at a conference in the United States, citing the New Map of the Republic of China as evidence of China's progress. Everyone present was excited, but Professor Kremer, formerly of Shanghai University, pointed out that it was printed by the Japanese, and everyone burst into laughter. Therefore, I initiated the organization of the Chinese Book Publishing Company in the United States two years ago. Later, because the registered name was repeated, it was changed to Huaxia Book Publishing Company. Considering that it is extremely difficult for printing factories to be all-powerful, it was decided to start with map printing first. I hope that it will be entirely done by the Chinese and publish a map that meets international standards. The post-war revised edition of the New Provincial Maps of China published this time was printed by the company's printing factory. Although it is a maiden work, the results are not bad. I hope that they can strive for excellence in map printing and be comparable to the maps printed in Switzerland or Germany.</p>
<p>The theory of the dragon veins winding in Chinese geography has a long history. After the Shenbao map canceled the "pen holder style" representation, the concept of teaching has changed. This cannot but be attributed to the courage to improve geographical teaching. Because the topographic layer coloring method has long been adopted in Europe and the United States, Mr. Zaijun said: "None of us three are geography experts, nor are we middle school teachers, but we understand maps and have surveyed and mapped maps." At that time, we boldly tried this method. There was no table of explanations attached to the map, nor was there a teaching method outside the map. We were afraid that the education field would find it unfamiliar and not adopt it. Unexpectedly, it just suited the taste of the professors.</p>
<p>We are now engaged in the compilation of another new map, which may be another attempt. Mr. Fang Jun of the Geological Society of China will have another explanation. This work is supported by Shenbao's advance payment of royalties to support the staff's salaries and material expenses. But in reality, because the pre-paid royalties will not be calculated for interest in the future, and the currency value is depreciating daily, the value will be negligible after one year. At that time, when I asked Mr. Fang to work with me, it was appropriate that a certain ministry planned to establish a research institute and asked him to preside over it. I advised him that it would be better to do this small thing, at least he could achieve some results. Mr. Fang accepted at that time. Now, the original manuscript of this new map has been completed.

<h3 id="e126">"Yang Mei Craze" <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Recently, the Yang Mei affair has caused a great uproar. Moreover, there are Yang Meis in Shanghai, and there are Yang Meis in Ningbo. The Shanghai people's so-called "mass frenzy" is fully demonstrated in this kind of matter. From a scientific point of view, it is certainly worthy of research. However, after so many days of research, what is the result after all? Even if there is a result, can it enable all 400 million Chinese people to practice abstinence from grains and achieve longevity? In today's national crisis, I feel that this is almost a joke. However, rather than saying it is research, it is better to say it is "curiosity."</p>
<p>The "Treatise on the Five Elements" in the Book of Han specializes in recording extraordinary celestial and human changes. Originally, China had the view of unity between heaven and man since ancient times, believing that human affairs could move the heart of heaven, and celestial phenomena were displayed to indicate auspiciousness or misfortune. Therefore, the Spring and Autumn Annals particularly valued solar eclipses and meteorites, considering them to be extraordinary changes. The matters in the "Treatise on the Five Elements" are even more numerous, such as floods, droughts, hailstorms, yellow dragons, auspicious herbs, lingzhi mushrooms, cauldrons appearing, a single birth of three sons, withered trees reviving, and the resurrection of the dead, filling the pages. It can fully represent the ominous yin-yang and five-element thinking of the Han scholars. Perhaps an event like Yang Mei would definitely have been included in the treatise. However, it is truly not easy to determine whether it should be regarded as an auspicious sign or as an evil omen; because if we force it to be interpreted as an auspicious sign, the rice price is rising like this, and the war is so fierce, it seems that it is too inconsistent with reality. If we regard it as an evil omen, we are reluctant to say it! Fortunately, now is not the era of strange yin and yang, everyone is researching, not determining good or bad luck, so there is no need to pursue it.</p>
<p>There is a saying in ancient Chinese poems, "Seeking immortals by taking medicine, often misled by drugs." Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, so wise and decisive, could not avoid feeling the threat of life. He had to send young boys and girls to the Three Immortal Mountains, build dew collecting platforms, and mix elixirs to seize limited life from the hands of creation. This so-called "not eating human food" is the first step to becoming an immortal and ancestor. Unexpectedly, what the ancient sage kings sought but could not obtain, now there is actually such a person. If Zhang Liang were alive, wouldn't he worship her as a teacher? However, facts speak louder than words. The alchemist's elixir ultimately could not seize life. Almost none of the late Tang Dynasty emperors did not die from taking elixirs. Those who admire Yang Mei today, should they unfortunately harbor this kind of delusion, should wake up quickly.</p>
<p>This kind of speculation may be nervous overreaction, let us leave it aside for now. Another motive comes from the failure to solve the problem of people's livelihood. Extending life by eating is something that even today's scientists cannot deny; the rice price is indeed too expensive, and life is really difficult, but the responsibility is not because people's food intake has increased or the number of people eating has increased, but there are other actual reasons. Ningbo, Changzhou, and Chongqing have all experienced rice riots, and everyone is in a state of anxiety. Especially Chongqing, it will never stop rising just because there is a guarantee from Yang Mei's research. Comparing it to the amount of rice that was plundered, Chongqing is even greater and fiercer than other places, isn't this another irony?</p>
<p>Then let me talk about curiosity. Strange people and strange things can indeed make people surprised and bewildered. However, there are too many strange things at the moment. Perhaps it is a common sight, and no one actually regards it as strange. What is this? It is the price of goods that rises every day. Looking through history, has there ever been a stone of rice worth one or several tens of millions, whether in ancient times or today, in China or abroad? Has there ever been a foot of cloth worth millions? The word "million," a few decades ago, was something that we common people would never use. Even if we used it, it was just an adjective. Now, when we hear the news from the market, we just shake our heads and sigh, and we will never exaggerate with such solemnity as when researching Yang Mei. Even if Yang Mei does not eat for nine years, it is only a very small special case, which cannot compare with the madness of this price increase, like sea waves, like storms, which are difficult for anyone to avoid. Therefore, I hope that the authorities do not only want to hear strange things, but rather study the price and size of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks more, and plan more for the resettlement and relief of refugees, which is really more useful than focusing their energy on this one thing. Moreover, there is a lesson that we should particularly remember, which is the story of Shandong Dang Hao Liang deceiving our Executive Yuan President before the War of Resistance. In these years, we cannot completely judge the hearts of small people with the belly of a gentleman—although we may not be that much of a gentleman either. If you don't believe me, look at the Yang Mei in Shanghai, isn't she already seen at the beginning but not at the end?</p>
<h3 id="e127">Raising Goldfish Indoors <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Among the tanks for raising goldfish indoors, those produced in Yixing are the best. However, since the War of Resistance against Japan, I have repeatedly asked friends to inquire, and it is said that Yixing has no new goods on the market. Alternatively, wooden buckets can also be used. Raising fish in wooden buckets is popular in Tianjin and Beijing. What must be noted is that the mouth should be wide and spacious, and sufficient sunlight is required. Other porcelain tanks, all those with a wide mouth and a flat bottom, are acceptable. For indoor fish keeping, large glass tanks can only be used for a short period of time.</p>
<p>The frequency of adding and changing water depends on the water quality and weather. If the fish do not come to the surface to spit bubbles and can stay peacefully at the bottom of the tank, there is no need to change the water. Changing the water too frequently can cause white spots to appear on the fish's body, which means they are getting sick.</p>
<p>Regarding how many fish can be placed in a tank, here is a ratio: for every four to six fish that are one inch long, they can be raised in a tank that is one foot in diameter. Exceeding this ratio will result in insufficient nutrients in the water, and the fish will float to the surface restlessly, requiring either a water change or a division into separate tanks.</p>
<p>Feeding is most suitable in the early morning. It should only be given once a day, and it is best if they eat all the live water fleas within an hour after feeding. If too much is given and they cannot finish eating it, it must be removed by any means two hours after feeding, because in spring, autumn, and winter, it is not a big problem to give too much food that they cannot finish eating. However, in summer, water fleas easily die, the water easily becomes smelly, and the fish cannot withstand it. Fish deaths due to water spoilage are common. As for water fleas, if they are sometimes difficult to find, they can be replaced with rice porridge, but the greasy liquid in the rice porridge must first be removed before putting it in. They also love to eat other things, such as algae (commonly known as foxtail grass), but it should also be given in small amounts.</p>
<p>Well water, tap water, and rainwater can all be used to raise fish, as long as they are clean, not smelly, and contain oxygen.</p>
<h3 id="e128">A Day in a Small Town <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>People who are tired of the city often long for the joys of rural life. A quiet environment and a simple life can greatly soothe tense nerves. With such a mindset, I took advantage of a weekend holiday and spent a day in my hometown, Town M.</p>
<p>Town M is located in a scenic area. There, spotless temples, dishes made with excellent ingredients and cooking skills, and jujube paste sesame cakes that are not greasy to chew (said to be made best by a confectionery shop called Gan Shengyuan at the end of the inclined bridge, which has been open for the longest time) are all very famous. I knew all of this very well. However, I accepted the kindness of Mr. Yang, a carpenter who had recently repaired my house, and stayed at his home for a short time.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's residence is his own property. Passing through the wall gate painted with black powder is a small courtyard, followed by three main rooms. Behind it is another courtyard made of cement. After that, there is also a garden, and pushing out a back door from the garden leads to a large garden that serves multiple purposes.</p>
<p>In one corner of the large garden, there is a clump of bamboo, covered under a semicircular shade surrounded by stone railings. The pool reflects the heavy greenery. It is said that before Mr. Yang bought this house, ghosts in mandarin sleeves would appear in the garden at night from time to time. Reason tells me that this is not the case, but the speaker's earnestness makes me half believe and half doubt.</p>
<p>In another corner of the garden, there are three sheep in a wooden fence, bleating at people. I wanted to find some weeds on the ground to feed them, but the ground was only covered with wild motherwort plants with white flowers. It is said that this has a bitter taste, and when sugar is added after boiling, it is commonly known as "bitter herb soup." But when I walked to the sheep, they ate it with relish.</p>
<p>I then walked to the back of the large garden and opened the back door. It was a field of crisscrossing paths. It was said to belong to the "warehouse" that specializes in collecting rent rice. A farmer in short clothes, rolled up his pants, and was walking in the mud that was knee-deep in water, driving a sturdy ox to plow the field. It is said that people without farming experience cannot move once their legs are submerged in the mud.</p>
<p>The surface of Town M is as calm, peaceful, and simple as in the past. However, the fluctuations in prices have also stirred up considerable waves in people's hearts. Rice with a limited price of ten million yuan is only some yellow rough rice, but pork is surprisingly cheap, selling for only two hundred thousand yuan per catty, which is more than one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. There are several reasons for this. First, the farmers' grains and wheat have all been sold out in the past few days, and they are waiting to use the money, so they have to sell it painfully. Second, bean cakes and other pig feed, which are used to feed pigs, have risen a lot, and some pig farmers are suffering from the burden and have to slaughter them early.</p>

<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>A person who does not give others a little happiness all day long will inevitably have no happiness himself.</p>
<p>The fallen red petals floating on the water envy the withered flowers falling in the mud, and the withered flowers in the mud envy the petals in the wind.</p>
<p>A person should preferably have two fans: a beautiful goose feather fan with an ivory handle, used in the midst of fragrant clothes and graceful shadows; and a large banana leaf fan, which is also indispensable at home.</p>
<p>Isn't "90% new" just "10% old"?</p>
<p>A glass diamond ring worth 150,000 yuan will also be priceless as long as it is worn on the slender hand of a noble lady.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Conjuring Trick <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>"When poverty strikes, change is needed" has been heard countless times. Let's see how to "change" things.</p>
<p>"Change" is a directed action. Therefore, changing for the better can break the "poverty" situation, as the saying goes, "change brings success"; otherwise, if you don't touch the root of "poverty" and change the pattern randomly, the result will only be to expose your weaknesses.</p>
<p>For example, when rice prices soared, the authorities took the measure of selling off reserves. This is from no control to control. Following it with price limits is naturally also unquestionable. Then, probably because the rice market was too stable, the price limit was cancelled again, another change. Coincidentally, as soon as the price limit was cancelled, there was a big price increase, rising to seven million, eight million, nine million, and ten million, and then they wanted to limit the price again, to limit it to ten million, another change. In less than a week, they suddenly said they didn't want to limit the price again. The result was that the price limit on white rice was cancelled, and there was a price limit on indica rice, another change—but there was one characteristic in this change, the quality of rice may be different, but the price limit was still ten million.</p>
<p>It can be said that they are good at changing, but the rice price responds to all changes with "no change." No matter what tricks you play, it always: rises!</p>
<p>Changing it again, the price limit on indica rice can also be cancelled. At that time, in order to "reduce the living burden of the majority of consumers in this city," should we implement price limits on corn and price limits on tree bark and grass roots?</p>
<p>"Changing" back and forth, how can this kind of "trick" only deceive children!</p>

<p>Mr. Shilinhao's virtue is extraordinary, and the letters convey new ideas. He lies in the south of heaven, nourishing his virtue, and silently observes the current situation, cherishing the people alone. The friendship between the two worlds is as deep as the sea, and the poetic thoughts are wonderfully divine in his life. The strings and bamboo are not old in Dongshan, and I wish you to take care of your old age.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Dynasty accepted the civilization of the times and greatly opened up the social atmosphere, the newspaper industry gradually flourished, and in the early years of the Republic of China, it developed at an accelerated pace. There was a slogan called "record everything heard," which had no correct basis, but people repeated it, and the consensus became a monument, as strict as a creed. In the last two or thirty years, the newspaper industry has made progress, and journalism scholars have carefully studied and compiled experts from China and abroad to establish an accurate definition of "news" and changed "record everything heard" to "observe everything heard," hearing a piece of news, you must investigate its details and truth as much as possible. When there is "news value", it becomes "news". This has now become extremely common knowledge, but at that time, literati presided over newspapers, and everything was at a loss, with most people groping in the dark. In the early stages, it is no wonder that there was a lot of muddling through.</p>
<p>The "record everything heard" that the newspaper industry believed in at that time, some people said that the "reporting of hearsay" of the old imperial censors could be cited as an example, but in reality, it seemed right but was not.</p>
<p>The censors were called "speaking officials" and also called "the ears and eyes of the court." Regarding the corruption and illegal behavior of officials inside and outside the government, they could impeach them as soon as they heard about it. The court would send senior officials to investigate, and if it was verified, the impeached person would be punished. If the report was completely false, close to catching shadows, the impeached person was innocent, and the impeacher was also innocent, unless the censor had prior bribery or held a memorial to extort money, the dereliction of duty was punished according to the rules, not because he spoke untruthfully. (Censors were occasionally punished for using excessive or disrespectful wording, which was a special case, an exception).</p>
<p>The duty of a news reporter is to establish words, the so-called "public opinion," which is similar to the so-called "pure discussion" of that year. Therefore, in a certain position, it is quite similar to the speaking officials of that year. Even if the words of the speaking officials were untrue, they were not considered a crime, one is because impeachment was their duty, and the second is that their "words" were only reference materials, which had to be investigated and reported by other parties to determine right and wrong, and were not immediately regarded as the final conclusion. News reporters are also like this, criticism should be as objective as possible, and records should be as accurate as possible. Naturally, it would be best, even if some have insufficient knowledge and are emotional, there are excessive words about current affairs and important people (like the former censors' memorials, often wantonly criticized, making the impeached senior officials feel unbearably humiliated), as long as the conscience is clear and there is no other motive, there is no private crime (that is, dereliction of duty). The difference is that the censors' memorials were sent directly to the "inner court," and the investigation and reply memorials sent by the inner court and the imperial edicts clearly announced whether it was right or wrong, true or false, and were only published in the so-called yellow-skinned Beijing News, which was poorly printed, and the dry documents were only purchased and read by a few officials, and were not popularized among the gentry and people. Therefore, even if the circumstances of the impeachment were false, the reputation of the person concerned had no great impact on society. Modern newspapers are different. They are not reading material for a few officials, but are aimed at a wide range of readers in society, and once they are slandered, the impression has been spread, and the loss exceeds the appearance. Therefore, "record everything heard" cannot be compared with the "reporting of hearsay" of the speaking officials and cannot be cited as an example. (At that time, there was also a popular saying that "if the record is false, it can be corrected," which is certainly a method. But the ancient lesson of "like dyeing oneself black" must also be known.)</p>
