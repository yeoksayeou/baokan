<h3>中美換文成立協定　復興農村工作廣泛　逐步改進經濟教育衛生</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕關於成立中國農村復興聯合委員會中，經中·美兩方代表根據美國援華法案及中·美雙邊協定之規定磋商結果，取得協議，並已於五日在京以換文方式成立協定。換文儀式於五日上午十一時在外部二樓客應中舉行，簡單而隆重，司徒大使代表美方，與我國王外長並肩落坐於渠等早已習慣之長案前，分別簽署來往照會後，並各簡短致詞，旋熱烈握手，交換收執照會後即吿禮成。王外長並於禮成後與司徒大使及賴普漢氏三人小談片刻，狀頗歡愉，參加儀式者美國方面有大使館公使克拉克，商務參贊鮑麟哲，農務專員陶遜及美國經濟合作署中國分署南京辦事處主任顧希伯等。我國方面爲外交部條約司長胡慶育，美洲司長董霖，帮辦陳世材，禮質司長沈昌煥，交際科長劉汀業，情報司長時昭瀛，帮辦周書楷及行政院美援運用委員會委員嚴家淦等多人。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處南京五日電〕爲中·美雙方交換照會規定成立中國農村復興中美委員會事，司徒雷登大使本日發表聲明如下：</p>
<p>本人懇切希望研究中國社會及經濟問題之學生，將視本日爲中國農村地區狀况趨向健全改進之途之里程碑。本日，王世杰博士閣下與本人所交換之照會，規定成立中國農村復興中美委員會。此一委員會之設立，係由于承認農村地區之改進對于中國全體人民之甫要性，並由于承認一項明顯之事實，此即此項復興工作應以改進此等地區之經濟，社會及文化狀況爲宗旨，本人對該委會之工作，將具深刻之興趣。本人確信該委會成立之消息，在美國聆悉之下必具重大與趣也。該委會之工作條件，猶如在本日交換之照會中所包括之協定中所規定者，範圍頗爲寬廣，准許該委會在農村復興方而從事極爲重要之工作。本人對干該委會之成立，尤感滿意之一點，乃由于此舉爲中，美兩國在該方面長期密切合作之另一章，至于中·美在該方面合作最近之實例之一，即爲一九四六年間之中—美聯合農業代表團。據本人所知，該代表團所搜集之材料及建議，大部份將被用作該委會工作之基礎。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕王外長關於農村復興換文於五日舉行簽字儀式時發表談話如下：</p>
<p>今日所簽訂之換文，祗是本年七月三日簽訂之中，美雙邊協定之一種補充。中國農村經渦長期抗日戰爭及共產黨之破壞，需待改進至爲迫切，此一農村復興計劃，即係適應此種迫切需要而議定。此一計劃可使中國農村在農村經濟，農村敎育及農村衛生等方面得到中美專家之技術的協助。此計劃實施之後，必可陸續使大量曾受敎育之靑年加入農村改進工作，因此，此一計劃不僅爲一農村工作計劃，並可演爲農村領袖人才訓練計劃。在協定中對此項計劃分配之經費，誠非甚鉅，但農村復興聯合委員會旣將利用現成政府及其他機構以執行其計劃，其所有經費當可爲其殼經濟之運用。本人熱盼此一計劃所用之款其產生的成績，決不亞於同數之款用於他途所得之結果，這就是我們對美國人民友誼的最好答覆。</p>

<h3>正視公用事業漲價問題</h3>
<p>從七月中旬起，上海一般物價勉强平穩，有的且在回跌。升斗小民方以爲物價漲勢也許可望稍止，欣欣然有喜色；但有遠見的人早在憂慮這個漲價的「小休」狀態究能維持多久。不出我們所料，與人民日常生活最有密切關係的公用事業，却突然公佈八月份的新價：自來水較上月約漲三倍，電燈約漲一倍半至三倍，煤氣約漲一倍半至二倩半，電話約漲一倍半到四倍，電車公共汽車也各約漲三倍。公用事數漲價的倍數，實在太　人了！員體些說：在自裝的電話，打一次電話，要二三十萬元，外面借打一次則需五十萬元，甚至有高達百萬元的；跳上電車或公共汽車，最近也要十四萬元，遠一些就要二三十萬元。試想在一般小民，如何掙扎下去？這次公用事業新價的暴漲，自然會影響一般生產的物價和職工的生活指數，因而不幸恐將釀成未來的「八月漲風」，亦未可知。在市政當局固然自問已經盡了他們的心力，而在一般市民的心理當然都感到受不了，市參議員們要求召開市參議會臨時大會來討論這個大問題，或亦實過處此，不能不為市民呼籲罷。</p>
<p>可是，我們討論一個問題，總得平心靜氣的想一想，尤其負責當局應該放大眼光為全局打算。今天公用事業所以鬧昨如此漲價，影響到個個人民的生活，其責任似乎不在市政當局。誰都知道，公用事業是人民日常生活所必需的，一般人民的衣·食·住·行，無一不與公用事業有關，每次漲價，即等於加重人民日常生活的負担。世界各國的公用事業，均視爲爲社會人群服務的事業，當非普通純以營利爲目的之企業可比，故每次調整價目，應該顧及人民是否負擔得起。上海市參議會於今年二三月間舉行大會時，爲安定社會穩定物價起見，對於公用事業曾經通過若干決議，並且建議組設公用事業調査委員會，調査各公司的收支實況及經營情形，以爲是否應許漲價之參考，而在積極方面則更協助市政府爲公共事業設法减低其成本，如主張公用事業所需的油類燃料等等，三個月結匯或購儲一次，於必要時並請中央採取貼補政策。誠以此項事業之漲價與否，可以牽一髮而動全身，乃有此種呼籲。然而調査公用事業之舉，中央旣一再指爲參議會無此權力，責其不必過問，而貼補政策則又堅持不應恢復；在這期間，外匯制度更改，結匯證明書的市價一月數跳，甚至一週數跳，雖然中央銀行已盡力贊助，貸以鉅款，而枝枝節節，究竟何補於事？况在中央則更於各業並未實行成本基數調整價格制度以前，偏又堅持公用事業必須首先實行，視爲「科學化調整物價」的至寳，一若別種事業可聽其不合「科學」，而公用事業則爲出類拔萃的事業。在此情形下，公用事業價格又安得而不漲？</p>
<p>我們絕對不願爲公用事業漲價作辯護，本市公用事業若干公司中，誠有或者開支過大，或者管理鬆懈，或者計算成本未盡合理，種種有需改良之處必不在少；而且此次市府核定的新價，究竟是否合理，也的確尙有硏討之餘地。不過我們願乘市參議會開會審査之際，不能不請市民，政府和各公司正視一個現實問題，然後共謀補救之方。</p>
<p>現實問題是什么？即是此次漲價主要的原因何在？我們以為此次公用事業漲價之所以甚大，其主要原因乃在政府外匯政策的變更。政府在五月底以前，採用平準基金價結匯。而自六月初起，改用結匯證明書了。故五月底的美匯價爲四七四（千元），而六月底則昇爲二四七四（千元），七月底又一躍而爲四八七九（千元）。換言之，六月底較五月底增四·二四倍，七月底又較六月底增〇·九七倍，亦即較五月底增了一〇·三倍。公甩事業開支所需燃料及材料需用外匯的，聞達百分之四十，則其必受此外匯在兩月間暴騰十倍之影響無疑。其次爲員工生活費指數之增高，七月底較五月底亦增加四倍有奇，必使公用事業開支中百分之二十受其影響。如果將此兩種上漲率與公甩事業在兩個月間之上漲率一加比較，則討論時庶幾可以比較接近現實的問題了。</p>
<p>但，無論如何，中央和地方當局，如果還是只知道提高一般外匯，而又不肯為一切生產事業所繫的公用事業列　補救之道，我們可以料到此種惡性循環上漲的趨勢或竟無由遏止，不獨公甩事業爲然，而人民的生活亦必更趨於水深火熱之中。大家千萬不要小覷這個公用事業的漲價問題，倘仍漢親現實，讓它自生自滅，很可釀成更大的惡果！</p>

<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕董顯光局長五日在記者招待會，答復詢問如次：</p>
<p>（問）總統與高級將領舉行會議，有何決策？關於新訓練之軍隊，曾討論及決定其任務之分派否？會議之時或會議結果，曾在指揮方面，有所更張否？</p>

<p>（問）岡村寗次何時審理？由何種法庭審理？檢察官所提之罪狀如何？岡村被列入戰犯偵察起訴之經過如何？此事係出於何人之命令？</p>
<p>（答）岡村寗次將由國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭審理，其審訊時間，將由該法庭宣佈，八月二日軍事法庭檢察官發佈之起訴書，對岡村寗次之罪狀及偵察起訴經過，均有詳盡說明，岡村寗次係於戰事結束後，即由國防部列入戰犯，發交軍事法庭檢察官偵察起訴。</p>
<p>（問）共匪誣指國軍破壞河堤，其眞相究屬如何？</p>
<p>（答）共匪誣指國軍破壞黃河提防搶修工程，顚倒是非，淆亂聽聞，水利部發言人已列舉事實，予以駁斥。查黃河南岸國軍雲集，萬一決口，不僅關係沿河人民之安全，且予國軍損害至鉅，故國軍非但無破壞堤岸之事，反之，國軍刻正在高莊集一帶，掩護修築河堤。</p>

<h3>聯勤總部財務署發表軍費領發情形　擬訂發餉新辦法核準後實施</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕聯勤總部財務署，以自本年四月份起，文武職人員生活指數逐月調整，官員薪餉不能一次淸發，以致時有官兵提出質詢。爲使全體官兵明瞭軍費領發情形，及薪餉分次發放原因，該署特發表軍費領發情形如左：</p>
<p>一，國軍部隊發放薪餉日期，原規定爲每月月底，至遲須於次月五日前發淸。新制部隊，則規定每月十五日至卅日，兩次發放。</p>
<p>二，軍費由財務署向財政部具領轉發各補給單位，再轉發到各部隊。須經過繁複手續和甚長時期。同時因財部須顧慮國庫所準備的頭寸，來應付浩大的經費，所以向例軍費均由財政部提前撥發，同時又不能不分數期撥發。</p>
<p>三，官兵待遇，逐月按生活數調整後，因其指數標準須於每月月底始能核定發表，財政部擬發經費也不能不拿過去的幾個指數分期來撥。拿七月份經費來說。第一次根據六月份原來指數四十二萬倍計算撥發（事實上這一批又分四次分撥），第二次因六月份核定指數過低，奉令借發薪餉半個月，約合指數廿一萬倍，財政部在七月十九日將支付書發出，再送請審計部核章後，財務署於七月十九日匯撥各補給機關轉發。第三次俟七月份生活指數一六〇萬倍確定後，除了已發的六十三萬倍外，還得補發九十八萬倍。這指數是七月卅一日行政院臨時會議決定的，院令發出到達財政部是八月二日。財務署於八月三日向財政部領到支付命令，即行送請審計部核章，八月四日核好章，即送中央銀行國庫局進賬，預定八月五日可全部匯撥各地補給機關轉撥。</p>
<p>四，救國日報七月卅一日登載各部隊僅領到六十三萬倍的薪餉，而沒有領到一五五萬倍。事實上各部隊確僅領到六十三萬倍，因行政院通令在新指數未確定前，均只能照舊指數六十三萬倍借給。至於新指數一六〇萬倍的經費，四日才領到進賬。該報七月卅一日登載時，指數還沒有正式確定，故誤爲一五五萬倍。當時財政部因尙未奉令，不能撥發，財務署日亦無從具領轉發。</p>
<p>五，本署對於官兵薪餉曾力求依限迅速發放，茲經依據財政部撥款時期，及每月生活指數核定情形，擬訂部隊薪餉發放辦法如下：（一）八月十日以前，按上兩個月即（八月照六月份）核定指數發給本月份借支一次。（二）本月底以前，照上月核定指數補發一次。（三）次月二十日以前，照本月份核定指數，淸發本月份薪餉。</p>
<p>上項辦法對以前規定每月月底發餉一次，已有很大改進。在當月底可以把上月指數補發淸楚，在下月廿日以前，又把本月指數補發。如上下月連貫起來，每十天官兵可將應得指數領到，毫無拖延。正由本署報請國防部核准後，通令實施。</p>
<h3>四聯總處理事會通過貸款案數件</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕四聯總處於五日上午舉行第三六九次理事會議，由翁文　主席，各理事均出席。通過：戰區各地部隊官兵，向郵局匯寄贍家費匯款，原則上應予减免匯水，以示優待，惟郵局求做此項匯數，賠累甚鉅，應由央行予以調撥之便利，以資貼補。詳細辦法，將由秘書處會同央行及郵匯局等另行呈擬核定。此外並通過　務貸款，各地鐵路路局工程貸款，及太原濟南民糧運銷貸款等案。</p>
<h3>陳立夫抵法</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕中國立法院副院長陳立夫，五日晨目倫敦抵達此間，渠將在巴黎勾留兩日。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京五日電」立委·監委歲費·公費支給暫行條例，總統五日以命令公布，條文如下：（一）立委·監委之歲費，定爲八千七百六十元，按月照調整文武職人員待遇實施辦法支給。（二）立委。監委之公費，定爲每月一百元，按公務員生活費指數核算支給。（三）立法院院長，監察院院長除　支委員歲費·公費外，月支特別辦公費二百元，按公務員生活費指數核算支給。立法院副院長，監察院副院長除照支委員歲費·公費外，其特別辦公費照前項規定八成支給。（四）本條例自公布日施行。</p>

<h3>國防部發表一週戰局　除太原外僅有零星接觸</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國防部頃發表自七月二十九日至八月四日一週戰局如下：</p>
<p>這一週的戰事，除了太原國軍因向外圍展開反擊，與匪仍在繼續戰鬥外，其餘各地，僅有零星接觸。匪在東北及保定，濟南外圍雖均有調動，然實際作用在掩護　主力喘息整補，短期內尙無大舉蠢動的力量。茲將各情分述於後：</p>
<p>一·華北戰地</p>
<p>太原方面：國軍正對匪逐漸展開反擊，外圍重要據點如聶家山（太原西三十華里），南屯（太原西南二十華里），小店鎭（太原南四十華里）等地，均經國軍一一收復。聶家山以北的白家莊煤廠，頃已恢復生產，所受匪軍威脅，業已完全解除。我空軍連日飛往平遙·祁縣·太谷等地，向匪軍各司令部及刧掠物資囤積地，予以猛烈轟炸，匪損失甚重。刻犯幷垣匪因補給困難，戰力已大爲削弱。在我陸空協同猛擊下，受創匪軍已有後撤跡象。</p>
<p>冀東方面：匪在豐潤，遷安間調動頻繁，一度曾向唐楡段作試探性之竄擾。但國軍部署嚴整，除派空軍轟炸遵化·玉田·遝安三角地帶在移動中之聶匪主力外，並派大軍向豐潤進攻，當於三日中午克復該城。目下冀東地區，並無新戰事發生。</p>
<p>冀中方面：平保沿綫近日無甚戰事，惟聶匪二·三縱隊各一部，及六·七縱隊主力，流竄在保定外圍，揚言將進犯保垣。惟國軍預有佈置，如匪妄圖一逞，必將遭遇冀東匪八·，十一縱隊同樣被痛擊的命運。</p>
<p>二·華東戰塲</p>
<p>魯中方面：濟南外圍，匪之兵力爲第六·第七·第八·第九·第十三渤海等縱隊，及新七·新十一兩個師，匪雖故作即將蠢動模樣，然在我陸空軍監視下，迄今尙未敢貿然進犯。</p>
<p>皖北方面：陳毅匪三·四·八·十一·兩廣快速等縱隊主力，仍徘徊在亳縣，太和，渦陽三角地區。週前因受我宿縣，永城方面國軍壓迫，匪一部流竄至早陽境內。阜陽守軍及民團因奉令爲適應戰略上需要以打擊匪之軍力，乃空室淸野，掩護人民，安全移動指定地，配合追擊國軍，徐岡對匪進攻。至津浦綫南段之散匪，則已完全被我軍逐退，此外蘇北方面：殘留蘇北之陳匪二·十二縱隊，一度擬偸越睢寗外圍，向皖境靈璧，宿縣方面移動，後以我津浦綫大軍出動邀擊，該匪又倉皇向洋河（宿遷東南）方向回竄，一部則竄至錢集（沭陽以南）附近滋擾。刻我南北兩路大軍，正向該匪股展開夾擊中。陳匪第十一縱隊殘部，現在東台以南喘息整補，最近無顯著活動。至一度陷匪的豐，沛兩縣，均經我軍先後收復。</p>
<p>三·華中戰塲</p>
<p>鄂北方面：我各路國軍，目的在打擊從襄樊地區敗退的匪軍，故未急於收復襄陽城，而以「捕捉戰」在襄樊外圍地區進行，追尋劉匪主力。該匪現除半數以上逃竄至豫西南外，餘分散各處，將被我軍痛擊。襄陽西南之南漳，現正被我軍圍攻，旦夕即可收復。襄陽城早已在我軍控制中。至竄擾鄂中安陸爲匪中原獨立旅，業被我軍擊潰，安陸亦於三日爲我軍克復。</p>
<p>豫西方面：我有力團隊一部，曾深入洛陽近郊奇襲，以偵察匪後敵情，結果達成任務，全師而還，沿路且多斬獲。至於宛西民團壯勇有爲，雄風猶昔，刻正配合國軍，向西峽口等地搜勦殘匪，俾使宛西四縣的西部山區也重新光復。現我平漢南段國軍，正不斷向舞陽附蚯展開掃蕩戰，已使竄踞該地之劉匪二·三·六縱隊等，無喘息整補之餘裕。</p>
<p>此外陜中國軍，已深入黃龍山區搜勦，東北國軍正在遼南遼西等地擴大面的控制，以無重要戰鬥，不再贅述。</p>
<p>海總政工處發表週來江海防情況</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕海總政工處頃發表：近一週來江防海防情况如下：近周來江防方面，長江下游龍梢港匪軍集結地帶，經我砲艇轟擊後，擊斃匪至少在二百人以上，同時掩護陸軍及地方團隊攻佔龍梢港匪軍陣地，殘匪不支潰退，竄抵天星橋。不明數目之匪，經我艦進剿後，立即潰退，匪臨退時，並鹵去地方保長等七人。我機動艇隊配合陸軍，由兩翼攻擊蘇北簡亭以西陶家林以東地帶之匪軍，經激戰數小時後，匪軍不支，紛紛潰竄，當被我鹵獲匪軍三十名，步槍二十支，木船十艘，斃匪百人，傷匪五十人。我機動艇隊於完成任務後，復轉攻湖垜建陽鎭匪軍，該鎭附近匪軍據點經我軍一一掃蕩，已無匪踪，除捕匪幹事十名外，並搜獲木船二十艘，物資一部份。至海防方面，威海衛戚家莊竹島及石島一帶匪軍岸上陣地，遭我砲艦連日不斷轟擊，將其澈底破壞焚燬，我巡弋金山港一帶之艦艇，於港外捕獲帆船一艘，上載不明番號便衣軍人二十名及步槍手槍手溜彈甚多，後該巡艦至劉公島外二十里時，亦突現類似前項汽艇一艘艇內載有便衣軍人三十人，因無法證明其身份，爲免魚目混珠之匪乘機騷擾，已令予以逮捕。烟台八角口及石島一帶，已同時捕獲接濟匪軍物資之匪船三艘，計匪物資五十六箱，另麻包十四袋，柴油一百桶。</p>

<p>〔中央社巴黎五日電〕法國外交部一如英外交部及美國務院，對四國談判內容亦嚴守秘密。一般人士認爲除非西方國家撤銷其倫敦會議，關於於法蘭克福成立西德政府之協議，蘇聯方能允許解除柏林之封鎖狀態。美國與論對一向堅定不移之政策的可能轉變，似不甚驚訝，法外交部人士認爲蘇聯謀求協議之切實，不下於西方國家，故前途尙可樂觀。據非官方消息，莫斯科及倫敦方面可能於兩日內發表會議之一部情形。</p>
<h3>在東德發行之新貨幣　蘇同意予以解凍　柏林至萊比錫間準許通車</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約五日廣播：據傳蘇聯已同意解凍蘇方發行之貨幣。據稱五日下午柏林市參議會與蘇聯支持下之德國經濟委員會舉行會議，已成立協議，此項協議特別表明係「臨時辦法」。英美金融界人士提出警吿，勿對此事過於樂觀。西方國家深恐蘇聯自覺讓步太多，結果將於未來會議中採取更堅强之態度。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林五日電〕柏林市政府當局五日拒絕蘇聯之要求。按蘇聯要求市政府宣佈，爲蘇聯所發行之東部馬克，爲市政府及柏林整個經濟生計之唯一合法通貨，若然則柏林之經濟將悉在蘇聯控制之下矣。西方佔領國家業已同意西方部份七十五萬職工工資，發給百分之七十五蘇聯發行之馬克及百分之廿五西方發行之馬克。市政府拒絕蘇聯要求之理由，爲此事將舉柏林全市授諸蘇聯，蘇當局更以凍結市政府及西方部份工商業之蘇系通貨基金爲手段，以遂其控制柏林金融之要求，結果使七十五萬職工七月份下半月之薪給均不能發出。德人要求西方國家儘量供應西幣，以對付蘇聯之行動，然西方在莫斯科談話尙在繼續中，對此項直接行動，頗有難色。此外僉信蘇聯解除柏林封鎖之交換條件，爲經濟上控制柏林，故局勢更形複雜。蘇聯五日准許西區火車可通往萊比錫展覧會，使人懷疑封鎖是否仍屬有效。蘇系「柏林日報」承認，柏林至海姆斯德鐵道雖因「技術理由」不准西方交通已有四十七日之多，郝仍可應用。又稱：將以專車四十三輛運輸西區遊人至萊比錫。美系「日報」載某鐵道發言人稱：自西區赴萊比錫之專車將經過海姆斯德而入蘇區。</p>
<h3>蘇聯封鎖柏林已自食其果</h3>
<p>蘇區糧食匱乏貿易停頓</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林四日電〕蘇方封鎖柏林之結果，已影響蘇區本身之經濟，佔全德百分之三十之蘇區工商業已因區間貿易之停頓而大受打擊。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕泰晤士報之柏林訪員今日稱，德境孫區聞發生嚴重食糧缺乏問題，該處已有數次禾威運動發生，甚多禾威者已遭逮捕。食糧貯藏不足之原因，一部分係由於徵收食糧輸往柏林之結果。該消息並證實外間以前對蘇聯邦是否有能力供應柏林全市食糧之懷疑。　克遜尼邦之柴資市及杜林吉亞邦之魯道爾斯坦特城暴動已發生，又在西陀城面已有人越過捷克境覓食。</p>

<p>〔合衆社貝爾格勒五日電〕美國今日在多瑙河會議中，指斥蘇聯之龔斷該河，並建議在聯合國下成立一國際權威機構</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒四日電〕蘇代表維辛斯基今日在多瑙河會議中，堅持自由航行並尊重多瑙河國家主權之原則。南斯拉夫代表貝伯勒以及捷克代表克萊門蒂斯均予以支持。維辛斯基力言蘇聯之建議，可加强多瑙河各國間在經濟與文化上之團結。渠嚴詞指斥英法堅持一九二一年公約之不當，渠稱，「在一九二一年公約下所設立之兩委員會中，其一爲非多瑙河國家所組織，另一亦僅羅馬尼亞一國參加，如何能保障多瑙河國家之主權。蘇聯主張多瑙河委員會僅能由全體多瑙河國家組成」。貝伯勒亦攻擊西方國家利用多瑙河各國本身之分裂，而將多瑙河霸佔。渠宣布完全支持蘇聯之建議，克萊門蒂斯亦支持蘇聯之建議，以結束非多瑙河國對多瑙河之控制。</p>
<h3>英美對特港問題駁斥南指責</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖四日電〕不顧共產國際情報局對狄托之譴責，蘇聯似仍將支持南斯拉夫對英美在特里埃斯特港行政之控訴。今日安理會中烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基支特南斯拉夫之立塲，認爲南斯拉夫有充分權利對英美在特港之破壞國際義務提出控訴。美代表傑塞普與英代表賈德幹則力言均稱南斯拉夫之指責並無根據，並指出特港盟軍政府曾按期向安理會提出報吿，而南斯拉夫則從未對其神秘之管制區行政提出報吿。南代表維爾芬指斥英美破壞特港之統一，支持破壞英美佔領區與南佔區關係之份子，並將英美佔區之經濟與義大利相聯繫，渠稱，保障特港獨立爲安理會之責任。至此在法代表巴洛迪建議下，安理會延會至下星期繼續討論。</p>
<h3>美國會特會通過休會建議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓四日電〕南部民主黨員反對人頭稅法案，作爲期五日之疲勞演說，已於今日下午四時卅五分結束。在結束之前，共和黨承認失敗，並同意拋棄此一具有政治爆炸性之法案，而開始僅對杜魯門總統反通貨膨脹計劃中一小部份準備採取行動。人頭稅問題之剔出參院議程，乃由於休會表決，並非今日休會明日重開之表決。此舉消滅任何在討論中之提案，故人頭稅問題現仍在提出建議使成爲立法案之過程中。休會表決係六十九票對十六票，政府派民主黨議員力爭無效。</p>
<h3>美報攻擊居里曾袒護中共</h3>
<p>居氏指間諜案爲攻訐行爲</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約五日電〕最近在美國會審査會中備受指斥，認爲有助共黨機密活動嫌疑之美前總統羅斯福之行政助理居里，今發表聲明稱：此項指斥「純係一種不確之攻訐與譏刺。」居氏稱：渠迄今未被違反美國利益行動諷查委會所傳訊，但渠極盼爲該委會所召見，「俾能立留否謀」．紐約每日新聞發行人及其專欄作家奧唐納，今在其專編中討論共黨間諜之實據時，亦攻擊居氏影響戰時美國對華政策左袒中共謂，自居氏及華萊士赴華以後，白宮首腦即開始援助中共，而對蔣主席冷淡。華氏赴華時，曾由居氏所僱用之拉鐵摩爾及國務院官員范宣德偕行，嗣後范氏曾被公開指責謂渠使美國對華左翼政策見諸施行。</p>

<h3>瞻望柏林的前途（下）</h3>
<p>— 章礝石譯</p>
<p>柏林，目前是分爲蘇，英，美，法四佔領區，在大戰結束之初，無論如何，柏林還可以算是統一的。那時，德人皆在四國軍政府代表指揮下工作着。現在市政府可分裂了，其原委自然就是蘇聯的拒絕承認西方列强在柏林的權限。</p>
<p>由於雙方意見的歧異，造成了柏林的危機。柏林的事件，使西方列强佔領區中的公共事業頗受威脅。因爲蘇聯持有大量的地下通道設備，這使西方列强佔區中的地下甬道陷入不正常的狀况下，因爲蘇聯切斷了來自蘇佔區的電力，這就使西方列强佔區中的電力减少了百分之七十五，現在所應用的電力，僅及平時百分之廿五。</p>
<p>柏林的實業，大部分集中於西區，而在西區工作的工人多住在蘇佔區內。該區工廠的出品，電器設備相當於全國之半，衣服相當於全國百分之四十，而現在，因爲原料缺乏，電力供應不足，兼之運輸不便，以致柏林的實業，便陷入麻痺狀態。</p>
<p>柏林的食物供應，以前是由盟國委員會指配予零售商發售的，而現在也已分裂了。蘇佔區由蘇聯供應，西方佔區由西方國家供應。因爲蘇聯的不供給新鮮牛奶和新鮮菜蔬，復斷截了西方國家對柏林食物·煤斤和其他物品的供應通道，這就使柏林的食物供應也就生問題了。</p>
<p>運輸，無疑是控制柏林的「鑰匙」。蘇聯當局就利用了這一點，就行施它的權力來控制西方與柏林的水陸交通。雖然蘇聯用了一連串種種的「理由」以說明「封鎖」的原因，但是柏林地方的人民都明白，這封鎖的目的，無非是蘇聯想把西方列强的勢力驅逐出柏林而已。</p>
<p>假如柏林西區沒有蘇聯的供應，那末該區就每日需要外界供給六千噸的物資，其中包括二千噸的食物，二千噸的煤，和二千噸的其他物資。到一九四八年六月爲止，在柏林西區倉庫中和店舖的食物，估計尙可維持三個星期的需要。</p>
<p>因爲水陸交通受控制，西方列强爲了應付需要，乃實行大規模空運。但是二百架的美國C五十四型運輸機，每日最多只可以運輸二千噸的食物和其他物資。西方列强的計劃，是希望能有四百架運輸機參加此一空運組織，但是預料在這四百架之中，只有一部分才是巨型運輸機。所以當嚴冬來臨的時候，柏林需要大量的煤和其他物資，縱使西柏林的二個機塲全供運輸之用，恐怕亦難保持「供求」的平衡。</p>
<p>蘇聯與西方列强協議而訂立一個新的約定以管制柏林，在不久的將來，又未始是不可能的事。但是這協議，對於西方列强軍隊駐留柏林的希望仍是很微。雖然，目前雙方都在想避免戰爭，但是這柏林事件在「縮短」與三次大戰的距離是無疑的。（譯自七月份美國世界新聞）</p>

<h3>花紗布管理委員會儘本月底前結束　今後廠商採購棉花完全自由</h3>
<p>花紗布管理委員會取消命令，已於該會主委王風僧氏昨晨由京抵滬時親自攜帶來此。據王氏表示：該會現督策各部門趕辦結束中，於月底前辦竣。今後商廠對國內棉花採運購銷等事宜，悉聽自由，將不受政府任何管制。至於外銷方面，如簽證核准，以及運用美棉代紡代織等工作，則將由政府另擬方案，交工商部籌設機構處理之。王氏並表示，推動紗布出口，爭取外匯，使國際市塲不致冷落問題，實為當務之急。政府早已計及，前有於本會結束後，組設花紗布進出口公司之議，其主旨即在於斯。一且實現，其行政管理則應屬諸政府，至業務聯繫則應官商合作。但紡建公司已有外銷機構之附設，是則民營似仍有單獨組織之必要。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據外鉗會息：因該會係花紗布管理委員會附屬機構之一，花紗布管理委員會。已奉令于本月底結束，該會當亦隨之辦理結束。惟目前成為問題者，即美援棉花，前經議定由紗管會與外銷會各佔其事。紗管會用以分配各廠商，外銷會用以製成紗布外銷。而該項計劃，亦經美援會之同意，今報載美棉第一枇緊急配棉，一千三百七十萬美元，業經美國經濟合作總署批准，可以動用，日內並即可取出棧單辦理報關，預計十日內即可開始提貨，則新機構之設，更為刻不容緩之事。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆濫異常　華股盤旋小升</h3>
<p>華股昨屢圖大振，但買氣因有經濟新計劃之顧忌，不能暢所欲為，過程平庸而多盤，終以銀根空前大濫，以小秀姿態結束。</p>
<p>晨初以經濟對策未經決定，並多助買證券傳說，而開高盤。永紗以一二二五〇元登塲，八九號一八三號一五四號二一八號一一號六五號進至一二五五〇元，一七九號九九號五五號一五三號二〇五號二一六號三〇號一〇二號一八五號賣出，退至一二三〇〇元。二一三號九八號一四三號一八七號二〇六號雖進，三號八三號六五號一八五號八九號一三四號一六九號賣意仍濃，退至一二二七〇元紗布回好，八九號一二六號七六號一三號二〇六號一六三號一五六號七六號一四五號進至一二六〇〇元二二二號一五四號五六號一一六號一四八號一三五號二一三號六一號二〇七號均出，而仍不支，近午五六號六九號二二八號六五號一一六號八九號三〇號一五四號九八號再行脫手，午收降為一二三三〇元。除聯華漲停，中法新華火柴統益信誼尙平，華豐中絲微挫外，餘均微漲。</p>
<p>後市永紗上場一二七〇〇元，七六號二〇五號五四號先賣到一二五八〇元，一三四號一四五號八五號九五號八九號一〇四號一六九號一七六號進至一二八三〇元，一八〇號一五二號一二號九九號一六九號八九號九五號了結，復低至一二六八〇元。塲內要求暫停後市之聲浪甚盛，交易無形中斷者甚久，一三七號一九〇號一四三號七二號吸收，升至一二八二〇元一六九號一七九號一四五號了結，收市一二七五〇元。新光則力自振作，形勢頗俏。較晨收除聯地永業漲停，統益中絲閘北漲半成，恒豐平，餘均小升，塲外各未上市股票以華商大生華成中華見秀，各升半成，餘僅穩健。</p>

<h3>解除現鈔缺乏恐慌　五百萬大鈔將問世</h3>
<p>央行當局向銀錢業表示　十日左右即可正式發行</p>
<p>自大鈔通吿發行後，至今流通市面者為一萬·二萬五千·五萬關金三種。惟二萬五千及五萬元者，發行數量甚少，致市上現鈔缺乏。數日來因各地匯滬遊資增多，更感恐慌。目前現鈔貼水，已達每十億元需八千萬元，國行對於每一家大行莊領取現鈔配額為二百億元，致無法週轉。大都開發本票，應付客戶，是以連日來各行莊開出之本票為數頗多。一部份大商店對大行莊之本票，亦已照常收受。茲據記者探悉，國行對於現鈔缺乏，極為注意，正在竭力設法解除，並正在趕印各項大鈔。原定月底問世之廿五萬票面關金，亦在加緊趕印中。聞決可於十日左右開始發行，國行副總裁劉攻芸已正式向銀錢業表示，謂現鈔缺乏之象，決可於十日以後解除云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來市而又發生現鈔缺乏之現象，銀錢業為此特舉行會議，有請央行設法解除困難之決議。據央行方面表示：行莊取現，國行均盡力設法解決，從未限制，惟以現鈔較少，不敷支配；且以目前通貨票面數額，與物價對比之下，顯已過小，而各項支付數額則隨物價之變化而激增，現鈔缺乏之眞因在此。一俟五百萬大鈔發行後，此項問題即可解決。</p>
<h3>銀根趨勢極鬆　行局昨大差出</h3>
<p>昨日銀根走勢鬆弛，惟現鈔仍極感缺乏。四行兩局一庫於票據交換中，因支付結匯及各地匯兌，有空前鉅額差出，總數共四七·九二〇億。其中以中央銀行差出二〇·九九一億，為數最鉅。中國銀行差出一一·三七七億，交通銀行差出一四·七三四億，農民銀行差出二九三六億，中信局差進二九九八億。郵匯局差出一三三億，中央合作金庫差出七四七億。商業行莊大交換差進一〇三五一億，小交換差進五七六八億，外商銀行共計差進三一八〇一億。</p>
<h3>結匯證書市價又升　與美匯黑市已接近</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來外匯結匯證明書市價激升，昨日已出六百萬關，與美匯黑市接近，出口業亦因之轉趨活動。以桐油而論，紐約市價折合為每担一億四千萬元，而織內價格為侮担一億三千禽元。豬鬃紐約市價折合國幣，侮司馬担為二十三億，國內價格侮祖懂十八億，尙有利可圖，故日來出口物資之交易，已轉趨活躍。聞結匯證明書之漲價，主因為近來輸管會發出各種油類進口許可證甚多，需要轉多，行情亦因之而好轉。進出口業中人士估計：如能使結匯證書之市價與美匯黑市之距離不超過20％，出口即無問題，出口走私之現象亦可消滅。</p>
<h3>人心轉堅去化活絡　食米一致回漲　白粳又出四千萬元大關</h3>
<p>食米回漲，銀根鬆濫未已，公用事業之鉅額漲價，使疲頽之人心，一轉而為堅秀。米店見低檔頻收，去化見活，開市後步升，南市塲挺升一百五十至三百萬，白粳復出四千萬外。秈米·糯米一致挺升二百萬元，北市塲上漲較少，粳薄秈各加一百萬，特高粳平定。昨日到貨南北二市塲共計二千七百五十二石。</p>
<p>麺粉由於公用事業之漲價，使成本加重，且輪運費亦見漲價，銀根鬆濫未已，散戶納胃頓濃，老車粉由一千三百二十萬升至一千三百七十五萬元，兵船交易較多，收市一三二五萬。前者升五十萬，後者挺七十五萬。雜牌粉一致挺三四十萬元不等，大包麩皮升五十萬。</p>
<p>雜糧一致吐秀，銀根極鬆，客胃增加，又因輪運費漲價等原因，黃豆挺升一百萬，苞米及元麥各在北帮之納取下，挺升二一百萬。蠶豆到貨不多，加砌一百萬，菉豆走銷活絡，上升二三百萬。芝蔴本街去化較多，亦加二三百萬，生仁少數做開，徐州生仁六千五百萬元。</p>
<p>食油轉漲，由於銀根甚鬆，散戶逢低納多，更因原料黃豆上漲，公用事業之漲價均加重成本，廠方大都以八千七百萬開售豆油，收市復高至九千萬回籠貨，生菜油收市八千三百萬，各漲七八百萬，生油漲一千萬，吉桶生油一億一千七百萬，小車蔴油挺五百萬元。豆餅散戶吸取，市轉上揚，軋升六七十萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市行情上展</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，潛勢鋒芒愈甚，行情各不示弱，相繼爭向前進。分析其上漲因素：（一）銀根鬆濫，跟蹤一般物價走勢而向榮。（二）公用事業與輪船運費均實行新價。（三）出口結斷證高做六二〇萬，迨後雖破入六二〇萬內，但人心仍未稍餒。線　此種情形，前途尙有　升之望。</p>
<p>又悉：當局為協助出口，爭取多量外匯，特由四聯總處，舉辦出口箱茶，抵押貸款，當時核定每担法幣一千萬元，但邇因幣值關係，根本已失實際需用，故日前本市茶輸出業同業公會唐理事長等，曾晋謁央行總裁兪鴻鈞，陳訴苦衷，兪氏深表同情，並允於下週初開會時討論一切云。</p>
<h3>退票又漸增多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕太市行莊退票數額，週一（二日）較高，合計四〇四一票，較上週最高數目三七八九張之紀錄，尙超過二五二張之多。退票金額為八千八百三十三億，亦較士週退票之最高金額六千六百二十七億三千九百九十二萬元之數，超過二千零五億八千零八萬元。週二退票張數及金額，均見减少，惟總金額仍較上週為高，計退票共二八二八張，共七千四百十一億元。週三退票二五〇三張金額為八千三百六十六億元。</p>
<h3>大批木材運滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華綸洋行經理之菲輪西北號，由菲律濱運來木材，計一百五十餘萬呎，前日（四日）抵滬，現泊三十三·三十四號浮筒起卸。又招商局海魯輪，昨自福州返滬，運來木料一萬六千餘件，現泊三號四號浮筒起卸。</p>
<h3>棉紗喊價砌升</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以紡管會繼續拋紗四種，但價格普升一億餘，因此開市人心步秀。四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開明日出即躍高一億一千萬元，現出亦好五六千萬，中途稍見回小。近收以津粤等帮採辦蟬聯，本街納胃亦健，貨主扳價頗堅。最後現出為二十億零五千萬，明日出二十一億，比上日續挺五六千萬元。至其他各支粗細紗，亦普高七八千萬，一億一二千萬，及二億三四千萬不等，成交僅四十三件。</p>
<h3>棉布緊俏</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開時以傳說之新經濟政策於下週公佈施行，市塲人心忐忑不定，喊價倐升倐降。十二磅龍頭細布初開因零星吸納不寂，市盤狂跳四百三十萬元，嗣以隔日浮多趁高出籠，至十時許回落七八十萬元，斯時難有空方壓力，但以央行大額差出，銀根步鬆，津漢等帮補進甚殷，更以公用事業費用激漲，廠方成本加重，並聞紡建公司祗開龍頭B字細布及三A彩球細有二種，塲內買氣復盛，人心異常堅昂。龍頭細布回高至五千九百二十萬結束，較上日回漲五百七十萬元。收後再度喊高至九百三五十萬有受主，其餘漂布粗布細斜嗶嘰等，亦均回升自一二百萬至四五七百萬元不一，成交一千六百疋。</p>
<h3>香港實行結匯辦法後紗布外運受影響</h3>
<p>〔香港專訊〕自修正出口證明書辦法，開始實行後，規定出口貨品除運往中國及英鎊區域者外，均須向政府結匯。此法實行後，首受影響者，厥為暹羅及越南兩地。按該結匯辦法，無異聯鎖制。凡轉出貨物往該兩地者，須向財政司作記帳式結匯，同時必須由暹羅輸入貨物來港，而中雙方撥帳，支付貨款。換言之，即辦貨往暹者，須由暹辦回貨物來港，以資抵償。此法實行後，最先受到影響者，厥為棉紗布疋行商。蓋目前各暹羅辦莊，多數尙未明瞭結匯辦法，故多暫時未取入貨。速日棉紗市因此沉靜，暢銷一時之四十支單子紗，亦不能避免。布疋市中，以扣布白布甲黑布銷暹較多。因上述之關係，亦稍受影響。查荷印方面，最近採貨意態頗慢，香港棉紗只靠荷印暹羅兩途外銷，現兩地均無採辦，市自不能不跌也。至於布疋市，仍有星洲方面支持，故所跌尙徵，據關係方面悉，平日採辦棉紗布疋之暹羅莊，均屬代辦性質，甚少由暹羅辦同貨物來港，此法實行後，各該莊將受相當影蠻云。</p>

<p>本年錫銻兩物在港銷路甚活，除銻由資源委負會經營外，純錫則官商均有裝運赴港，同時均由雲南，廣西產區直接逕運廣州轉港，且由南洋·加爾各答·印度等商埠前往採購，而香港本埠實銷原甚稀少，惟年來我國工廠遷港後，實銷已較以前為多。現滬市純錫價，同行交易，則為每噸一百廿億，而大量價格為一百十五億。銻價每噸為三十二億。又悉：香港來滬進口較多者，則為黃銅角及百分之九二紅銅，前者每担售港紙一百元，後者侮担售港紙七十四元。以上市價降落，均係依港匯升縮為依歸。</p>

<h3>籃球賽重要一關　我隊敗於菲律賓　進入決賽週希望微弱</h3>
<p>〔中央肚倫敦五日電〕我出席世運籃球隊昨夜於哈林蓋球塲與菲律賓隊比賽，結果五十一比三十二敗於該隊，此為本組戰中之重要一關，今巳失去。四十分鐘內，我隊雖始終興奮作戰，然對菲律賓之敏捷行動，則難以應付，臨此勁敵，我隊已不能得取主動。初賽時，我隊採防衛戰略，菲隊乃未獲逞，包松圓於此時獲得八分，並力阻敵隊來犯。十五分鐘之拉鋸戰後，菲隊話鋒，忽趨活躍，上半時以十三分領先。下半時菲隊合作緊凑，投籃準確，氣燄愈盛，我隊諸鋒不能深陷敵陣，除包松圓一人外，其餘諸隊員表演均不如平常。我隊數度易將，然均鉀助，我隊失此一戰，晋入決賽級之希望甚微。因第二組中，（我隊屬本組）二領先隊智利及菲律賓，均僅敗一塲，唯此二隊再戰失敗，中韓兩隊積點，則可能與智菲兩隊積點相平。據世運會籃球競賽規程，如積點相等，則用得分平均法決定名次。較字較大者佔先，迄今我隊得一百五十五分，菲律賓得二百廿七分，智利隊得二百四十八分，韓國隊得二百卅分，（各隊均减去負分）如積點相等，我隊與伊拉充隊比賽時，即需得約一百五十分，其他三隊，均予勝伊拉克隊一百餘分。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦四日電〕今日世運籃球中國對菲律賓之比賽中，中國隊員因體力疲憊，不幸以三二分對五一分敗北。中國籃球隊今日雖敗於菲律賓之手，然中國球員尤其為蔡文華與李震中之球藝，仍贏得觀衆之喝彩，比賽時雙方急進疾退，速度之快，使裁判員亦感應付不及。</p>
<p>〔合衆社哈林蓋四日電〕籃球賽第二組中，「急起直追」的中國隊，四日晚不能再創造一次奇續，以五十一比三十二分，向菲列賓隊低頭。昨晚菲隊勝中國及比利時勝智利後，今後中國隊之前途繫於今晚智朝及菲比之戰果而定。下列幾種可能的發展：（一）若智利勝朝鮮，菲列賓勝比利時，則智利與菲將各以九分，稱冠第二組。中國可得八分與第三，比利時及朝鮮可得七分，分列第四五。（二）若智利勝朝鮮，菲列賓敗於比利時，則智利將以九分稱冠，中菲比三隊各得八分，並列第三。（三）智利敗於朝鮮，菲列賓勝比利時，則菲隊將以九分稱冠，中·智·朝鮮各八分，列第二名。（四）朝鮮勝智利，比利時勝菲列賓，則第二組中·菲·朝·智·比·五國，皆為八分，不分上下。</p>

<h3>世運籃球賽我隊勝韓　狂歡一幕</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦五日電〕此間一致認為除昨晚中國對韓國之一戰外，其他籃球預賽，均未呈驚人戰績。中國籃球隊之優良比賽精神，乃為此次四十九對四十八分而榮獲勝利之要素。按上半時韓國以二十八對十六分領先，於下半時中國隊雖竭力反攻，但迄第三段終了。華僑觀衆大部均認為勝利機會渺少，尤以比賽終了以前，韓國隊仍列前茅，但於最後五分鐘，中國隊拼命「打氣」，尤以第八號李世僑之遠射，令人欽佩不至。渠之勝利，深切感動其他隊員，故於五分鐘內，連得十六分之多。在最後一分鐘內中國隊得一罰球機會，但未入網，被韓國隊搶去，直衝至中國方面，此時李世僑即將球搶下，立赴敵方陣綫，以百米穿楊妙術，於比寳終結之前一秒鐘，擲入球網。英國觀衆對於李世僑之球藝極為欽慕，渠之不時驚人動作，常使觀衆呼喊「矮子」不至。尤以最後數分鐘，呼躍之聲，連續不斷，英國廣播公司國語粵語播音員，亦因而大聲疾呼，使該公司之調節室內，技術員驚奇不置。比賽後，中國隊員高抬李世僑，有時竟將渠之雙脚抬高至頭部以上，在英華僑亦均羣集鐵網邊，求先睹為快。</p>

<h3>閒話美國大選</h3>
<p>— 綠滿</p>
<p>生活畫報（Life）的編者是一個刻薄的人，他用大半頁的篇幅刋載了一張杜魯門競選演說的照片，那禮堂容積極大，然而聽衆却祗坐滿了前面寥寥幾排。那張照片上大半的地位全是空座。編者還不肯放鬆，在說明中輕輕的說道，杜魯門這次競選演說倒產生了一件令人難以置信的事實，就是：他居然還有沾沾自喜的勇氣！</p>
<p>事實上，我們不妨說杜魯門今日叫座的能力，竟已連華萊士都不如，華萊士發表演說時聽衆須買門票，而居然常常擠得滿坑滿谷，立着聽他演說的人佔滿了會塲中的隙地。</p>
<p>但是，這並不是說華萊士會在這次大選中創造什麽奇跡。儘管他口若懸河，須知樹敵已多，這正是美國大選傳統中最大的禁忌。以塔虎脫的門閥聲望，處心積慮籌備競選業已多年，而終至在共和黨大會中敗下陣來，主要的原因，也就是為了人綠不好。</p>
<p>每一個美國人心底都是想做總統的，但那些少數眞正在活動競選的人，却眞是無孔不入，吃力非凡。根據美國憲法，美國大總統祗要年在三十五歲以上，生在美國本土，居住美國在十四年以上。但實際上的條件却苛刻得多：他必須是一個「大」州出身，白種，相信新敎，在家庭中是一個賢夫良父，必須極規矩，必須愛好農民生涯，必須會釣幾條魚，還要在牀上有耐心看幾頁偵探小說。</p>
<p>具備了這些條件之後，還要能够認認眞眞的競選。競選是很不容易的，「到白宮之路並無捷徑。」一個候選人必須在幾年前就開始耐心地計劃一切，他要懂得討價還價的訣巧，要有切實的「幹勁」。</p>
<p>躱在總統候選人後面策劃一切的，是他的「助選主任」·此人必須有極高超的組織力，有宣傳天才，能够在遭受失敗的時候使大家反而覺得是佔了上風。最緊要的是：他必須密切注意選民們的愛憎，然後覷準「苗頭」，對症發藥，務使那位競選人的一舉一動，都能博得民衆的好感。</p>
<p>在候選人出發競選的時候，他整大的行動都須事前詳訂計劃。助選主任先派人出去做準備工作，等候選人到達時，助選的人就先吿訴他在這個地方那些事情特別要緊，說話時應當如何說法。他演講時，他們助選人早已三三兩兩散座在聽衆席上，一等他講完就提出一兩個捧塲性質的問題，有時就率先拍手，以引起大家的附和。</p>
<p>候選人本身當然也懂得一看那一等人說那一等話」的訣竅，自相矛盾，勢所難免。這次競選中史泰遜就吃了這個虧，他的敵人把他的演說唱片收集起來，偏偏把有一點矛盾的兩張同時在電台廣播，史泰遜狼狽不堪。</p>
<p>杜威在尼布拉斯加州演說時，忽然講台上來了一隻狗。據聯台社說，那時杜威就吩咐把那只狗趕出去。這一下可急壞了杜威的助選主任—全美國無數愛好養狗的男女豈不要對杜威大起反感嗎—於是他急急忙忙要求更正，他們說，杜威見了那條狗之後所說的話是這樣幾句：「喂，你也來和我們在一起，好不好？—牠眞像我童年時在密希根州奧和索故鄉所養的一只獵狗。</p>
<p>此外，杜威不肯戴印第安人那種插滿了羽毛的頭飾，也使他的助選主任頗表不安，他躭心着兮秋他會因此損失一點印第安土著的選票。</p>
<p>塔虎脫在德克撒斯州競選時，為了表示愛好運動起見，特地去看賽球，這塲球踢得精彩百出，而塔虎脫却在衆目昭彰之下，在看台上呼呼入睡！這一下失着使他失掉的選票一定不少。</p>
<p>一位美國大總統還需要一個條件—杜威是及格的，他就獲得了初步的勝利；馬丁，塔虎脫，史泰遜，麥克阿瑟都不及格，他們就失敗了。</p>
<p>什麼條件呢？</p>
<p>第一，現在無綫電傳影已經應用得很普遍了；第二，大家都在爭取美國數量可觀的女選民—因之，總統候選人竟必須長得相當漂亮！</p>
<p>在共和黨提名時失敗的衆院議長馬丁摸摸自己的下巴說：「不知怎樣，我的鬍子總是像幾個禮拜沒有剃的樣子。」而這也許正就是他落選的原因之一。</p>
<h3>記饒漢祥</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>民初文壇，長才輩出，而以一介寒士，置身靑雲者，允首推饒漢祥。漢祥字苾生，或作宓生，隸籍湖北，晚淸癸卯舉人，早歲從樊樊山游，詩文閎麗，筆札精妙，乃師深器異之。平生尤熟漢書，終日手執一卷，諷誦自得，人有質以疑難，靡不應答如流，與馮君木姻丈之專史記，章太炎光生之嫻漢書，堪鼎足而三。</p>
<p>饒氏貌奇　。食頃，吐沫四濺，肴核狼藉，喜覆餘羹於湯碗。初為福建候補鹽大使，學務公所總務科科員，同僚胥憎其齷齪，視共餐為苦事，遂見落落寡儔，悒悒失志。時提學使姚文倬，積學士也，知其異衆，禮遇稍隆；惟所屬多天下賢士，若陳寳琛江春霖等，皆一手延聘之議長，氏雖淹雅，亦難獨邀靑睞。居所內，終蠖屈莫伸，因是一怒求去。</p>
<p>歸鄂後，衣衫襤褸，百無聊賴。　緣獲識黎元洪，元洪一見莫逆，譽為當世江郞，委以　室之重。及任總統，復擢漢祥為秘書長，繼湯化龍之後。其間黎氏數度通電，文筆佳妙，至今膾炙人口；世傳咸出漢祥手筆。此事據予所知，泰半失實，蓋其曩在舊京時，嘗謂家父曰：「始發數電，實樊山師手稿。彼遣老，雅不欲顯名，顧於漢祥誼屬師生，願為代庖。世人不察箇中源委，致所據事實，適相逕庭。」綠家父嘗充學務公所科長，與漢祥最稔，刮目相待，漢祥亦引為知己，故語無攸隱，悉露秘辛也。</p>
<p>憶氏旣躋顯宦，即屢訪家父於舊京旅邸，深致拳拳之忱。家父絕意仕途，無所冀求，答拜之後，遽返滬濱。不旋踵，漢祥復來翰，稱前承枉顧，有失逆迓，嗣訪已南旋為悵，來書不譴，足見舊情云云。其絕無絲毫官架，由茲可覩。世之好為着朱交態者，觀此能無愧乎。後投關外大將郭松齡，松齡敗，漢祥亦鬱鬱終，遺一女，無子。倘所謂盈虛倚伏。福禍參半者耶？</p>
<h3>聯話</h3>
<p>— 任以</p>
<p>聯有用疊字者，前本刋載健秋君聯語雜談一則，引西湖平湖秋月聯，固佳，西湖另有一聯，一字一疊，更見其妙。聯云：「翠翠紅紅，處處鶯鶯燕燕；風風雨雨，年年暮暮朝朝。一十字耳，寫盡西湖景色矣。</p>
<p>偶檢故紙，得舊雜誌數册，長夏無事，以之消遺。見有巧對一，曰：「天上月圓，人間月半，月月月圓逢月半。今朝年尾，明日年頭，年年年尾接年頭。」</p>
<p>吾邑宜興南門外里許，有長堤跨荆溪，傳係宋岳武穆追金兵，築此通行，故名「岳堤」。堤旁有小亭一角，三面環水，風景絕佳，邑人有撰聯以記勝跡者。周組園聯：「關情水月疑無路，閒話春波曲水亭。」程蟄庵聯：「南渡小朝庭，獨有長堤千古。東鄰舊禪院，時聞淸磐一聲。」亭之東隅為泗水庵舊址，有儲簡翁聯「風雨四時了無障礙，谿山萬古仰此精忠。」抗戰中岳亭燬於砲火，亭中各聯已成廣陵絕調，大可惜也。</p>
<p>有一財神廟聯，每字皆從「　」，頗別緻。聯云：「遠近達道逍遙過，進退連還遇運通。」</p>
<h3>記阿益</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>涂鴉字未成，手指忽已黑，不見小皮球，縱聲淚沾臆，拭却變淚乾，顯得雙圈墨。</p>
<p>吃菜愛肥肉，無事頗鹿鹿，翦刀每在手，碎紙忽滿屋，走路無好步，開口有歌曲，有時提爺鼻，有時遮爺目，要爺快透氣，要爺不能讀。</p>
<p>出門學梳妝，對鏡殊喜懌，點額焉支紅，敷髮香粉白，忽然作鬼臉，自笑復自惜。</p>
<p>書聲暫覺停，側首臥已熟，上床忽又醒，手脚頗栗六，泥姐說故事，問娘要飲啄，探囊出花生，滿床花生效。</p>
<h3>紫羅半盦雜碎</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>故波蘭大音樂家柏特魯斯基氏，夙以鋼琴聖手蜚聲於世，歐洲第一次大戰時，不復與琴鍵親，或以為間，則慨然曰：「當此世亂紛紛之日，我安有心緒復事聲樂哉！」愚今歲情懷，亦正類此，竊欲如君苗焚硯，不復為文字役，顧心有所觸，有不能已於言者，則悼亡之痛，迄猶未能釋然也。溯自亡婦鳳君之喪，倐逾兩載，干戈未戢，生事日艱，脫使渠而猶在世者，亦且憂傷憔悴而死，翻不若一瞑不視之為愈耳。兩年以還，愚除珍藏其生前日用之遺物外，復搜求動植物之與鳳有關者，致之鳳來儀室中，俾覩物思人，藉慰相思之苦。畏友趙子雲蔡震淵張企賢諸君，各惠我鳳仙花佳種，有白鶴頂，紅鶴頂，紫鶴頂，妃色鶴頂，及噴砂灑金諸品；范子明兄則以鳳尾竹及月季大鳳相餽，拳拳之意，彌可感　！惜斯世聖人不出，苦不能生致一鳳，為憾事耳。文友吳吉人兄，去歲嘗以么鳳二頭見貽，愛如拱譬，詎不數月而破籠飛去，惋惜之餘，賦詩寄恨，而其所處之白銅圓籠一事，遂亦虛懸至今，蓋吳中不易致此也。日者老友蔣保釐兄自滬來，攜有新生么鳳一雙，云為吳吉人兄斥重金購以相貺，託彼轉致者，隆情稠疊，感何可言！爰以三絕句寄之：「人天一訣苦分歧，悼鳳情懷百不宜；誰分鳳仙花放日，雕籠重見鳳來儀。（么鳳來時，鳳仙花方爛開如錦。）」「非魚亦自知魚樂，天相吉人樂少年；（吉人兄善蓄金魚，樂此不疲。）雙鳳遙頒嬌好甚，脩條豐羽似藍天。（鳳羽絕美，作天藍色。）」「年時舊恨如春草，日夜滋生不可芟；好烏多情能慰我，未須飛夢到靈巖。（亡婦葬於靈巖之繡谷公墓中。）」</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>松立中學，仗收畫維持，故取於學生者不能不隨時增漲，以免賠累，或博盈餘亦不外人情。辦學敎學，亦當以各人生計為念，並不同於慈善事業。率直言之，學費之必須按生活指數遞漲，與商家貨品少按市價行情而增價，性質相似，而貧寒子弟之焦慮無力繳費，人學為雖，與平常人戶之為物價高昂，生活不易而發愁，正是一　。</p>
<p>商家隨時漲價，百物高昂，超乎多數人之購買力，結果是蕭條閉歇。私校之收費加重，超乎多數生之繳納力，結果是投考人少，退學者多，門可羅雀，而國立及市立之中小學暑期招考，則戶限為穿，十倍擁擠，但取錄名額，限於定章，私校惟恐來者不勇，而公校則惟恐來者太多，雖有大力請　，亦難應付，榜發下第者紛紛，不免望門乘涕，「安得廣厦千萬間」乎？次代國民之敎育，誠不堪設想。</p>
<p>僅舊都一市，已是如此。而關外之「難生」，又與「難民」源源而來，於是九城內外空閑房室，不是臨時學校，就是難民收容所。此情形頗與當年「九一八」事變後相似，惟「九一八」時，關外完全陷於敵手，士民不甘奴居偽都偽市，奔避於平津，今則灌長仍在國軍掌握，全區皆在本國治下。若云遼瀋各都市已是「孤島」，則舊都又何嘗不四郊多壘各路被「扒一乎？且山西亦遷校於平，已有數批西方「難生一駕空而至，足見各方面認此問為「樂土」。而實際是否有餘裕以廣厦大庇各方之來者，抑增加此間之負担，則觀於一般之情形及紀載，自能了解，不待繁言。各方面人來得多，隨之而來的「游資」亦來得多。昔語謂「人旺財旺」，郤像是應在今之北平。前淸及民初，此地為都城，各省人士雲集，匯款所聚，市面繁呂，因為那時的錢，是「錢」不是「楮」。眞錢實貨，能使工商茂暢，血脈流通，「褚」幣游資，則使物價昂騰，物資益缺。昔之舊都五條鐵路四通八達，水陸物品，無不流通，今之舊都交通多阻，物產稀微，而大鈔大券，郤要時時增漲其流通，故結果適得其反。</p>
<p>來平之難民，住的問題，比之食的問題，較有辦法，即因「物」雖不「博」，「地」却不失其為「大」，有些大壇大宇，大廟大寺，如安定門內國子監，西便門外白雲觀，永定門內天壇，都做了收容所。</p>
<p>國子監即古之「太學」，內有全國第一莊嚴的孔子聖廟，有祭酒司業博士助敎之講堂，及各肄業生之課室，宏闊蒼深的庭院，而今為數千難民擁住，天氣暑熱，汗氣薰蒸，已有時疫發現。白雲觀是所謂長春眞人邱處機所留的「蓬壺閬苑」，廟址極大，院多神多，前淸時香火之盛，氣派之大，無與倫比。而今一派荒凉，自火燒老道大案後，更面目全非，指作「收容」，尙不失為廢物利用。天　是明淸兩代皇帝郊天之所，規模之闊，建築之精，尤異尋常，今為一部份大兵營舍，其中情形，則不堪言狀。</p>

<h3>Agreement Established Between China and the United States Through Exchange of Notes: Extensive Rural Reconstruction Work to Gradually Improve Economy, Education, and Health</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Regarding the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, agreement has been reached by representatives from both China and the United States after consultations based on the U.S. Aid to China Act and the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement. The agreement was established today, the 5th, in Nanjing through an exchange of notes. The exchange ceremony took place at 11:00 AM today in the guest hall on the second floor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ceremony was simple yet solemn. Ambassador Stuart represented the U.S. side, and Foreign Minister Wang of our country sat shoulder to shoulder with him at the long table they were accustomed to. After signing the incoming and outgoing notes respectively, they each delivered brief remarks, then shook hands warmly, and the ceremony concluded after exchanging and receiving the notes. After the ceremony, Foreign Minister Wang had a brief conversation with Ambassador Stuart and Mr. J. Lossing Buck, and appeared quite cheerful. Participants from the American side included Minister Clark of the embassy, Commercial Counselor Pauling, Agricultural Attaché Dawson, and Mr. Joseph L. Buck, director of the Nanjing office of the China branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, among others. From the Chinese side were Hu Qingyu, Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Dong Lin, Director of the American Affairs Department; Deputy Director Chen Shicai; Shen Changhuan, Director of the Protocol Department; Liu Tingye, Chief of the Social Affairs Section; Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department; Deputy Director Zhou Shukai; Yan Jiagan, a member of the Executive Yuan's Committee on the Use of U.S. Aid; and many others.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the exchange of notes between China and the United States for the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, Ambassador Stuart issued the following statement today:</p>
<p>It is my earnest hope that students of Chinese social and economic problems will regard this day as a milestone in the trend toward sound improvement of conditions in rural China. Today, the notes exchanged between Dr. Wang Shijie and myself provide for the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. The establishment of this commission is due to the recognition of the importance of rural improvement for all the people of China, and due to the recognition of an obvious fact, namely that the purpose of this reconstruction work should be to improve the economic, social, and cultural conditions of these areas. I have a deep interest in the work of the commission. I am convinced that news of the commission's establishment will be of great interest when heard in the United States. The terms of reference for the commission's work, as stipulated in the agreement included in today's exchange of notes, are quite broad, allowing the commission to engage in extremely important work in the area of rural reconstruction. One aspect of the commission's establishment that I am particularly pleased with is that it represents another chapter in the long-term close cooperation between China and the United States in this area. As for one of the most recent examples of Sino-American cooperation in this area, that would be the Sino-American Joint Agricultural Mission of 1946. To my knowledge, the materials and recommendations collected by the mission will largely be used as a basis for the commission's work.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Foreign Minister Wang made the following remarks at the signing ceremony for the exchange of notes on rural reconstruction held on the 5th:</p>
<p>The exchange of notes signed today is merely a supplement to the Sino-American bilateral agreement signed on July 3rd of this year. Chinese rural areas have suffered greatly from the long War of Resistance against Japan and the destruction by the Communist Party, and there is an urgent need for improvement. This rural reconstruction plan is agreed upon in response to this urgent need. This plan will allow Chinese rural areas to receive technical assistance from Chinese and American experts in rural economics, rural education, and rural health. After this plan is implemented, a large number of educated young people will surely join the work of rural improvement. Therefore, this plan is not only a rural work plan, but can also evolve into a rural leadership training plan. The funds allocated to this plan in the agreement are certainly not very large, but since the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction will utilize existing government and other institutions to implement its plans, all its funds can be used in the most economical way. I earnestly hope that the results produced by the funds used in this plan will be no less than the results obtained from using the same amount of funds in other ways. This is the best response we can give to the friendship of the American people.</p>
<h3>Main Text of the U.S. Ambassador's Note</h3>
<p>"Greetings: Whereas Section 407 of the U.S. Aid to China Act of 1948 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), enacted by the Government of the United States of America, provides, inter alia, for the conclusion of an agreement between China and the United States of America to establish the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, I hereby submit the following recommendations regarding the organization of the Joint Commission and related matters in accordance with the general principles stipulated in the Act, especially Section 407 of the Act:</p>

<h3>Navigation on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze Resumes Night Navigation Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 5th] Navigation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was once banned due to instability on the river surface. Now that the situation on the river surface has improved, the above ban has been lifted, and night navigation resumed on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Successive Capture of Strongholds in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Passenger Boat Between Taixian and Dongtai Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 4th] (1) After the National Army in northern Jiangsu recovered Peixian, they continued to advance north. From July 31 to August 3, they successively captured strongholds such as Liu Wharf, Anguoji, Weilou, and Zuo etc. They have now advanced to areas such as Toudaowei, Zhuwangzhuang, Sanhejian, and Longguj, and the 7th and 8th District Core Regiments of the bandits have been defeated, and are fleeing in the direction of Luxi, Yutai Lao Zhai Township, and Liu Zhai. (2) A passenger boat between Taixian and Dongtai recently sailed east from Shikang to Dongtai. When it passed Yeye, it was attacked by 50 to 60 bandits. Soldiers from our escort gunboat boarded the east bank to provide cover. Unexpectedly, 300 more bandits attacked us from the Zhang Jizhuang area, and the Maloulou Township Joint Defense Team also rushed to reinforce.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 5th] The main force of the Communist bandits east of Taiyuan is moving eastward, and there is a trend of gathering in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th] The National Army advancing south from the periphery of Taiyuan captured the villages of Xiwenzhuang and Beiyangzhuang east of Xiaodian Town on the morning of the 4th. A fierce battle is underway in Xiwenzhuang North. The bandits mobilized more than a thousand reinforcements from Mingli to counterattack. By dusk, the bandits had suffered many casualties, and their position was shaken. In addition, the new airport located about ten li south of the Shanxi Barrier began to be used on the 5th. It is now known that civilian flights traveling between Ping and Shanxi will land here.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 5th] A spokesman for the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters said on the 5th that there was no news to be released about eastern Hebei. The Suppression Headquarters has not received official reports about the external reports of the recovery of cities such as Lulong, Qian'an, and Fengrun. The spokesman also said that the military judged that the rumors circulating in Tianjin and Tangshan were not based on actual facts, and that the above-mentioned areas are currently mostly vacuum zones.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] There is no change in the bandit situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway.

<p>Sketch Map of Northern Hubei and Southern Henan</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 5th] Military News: It is confirmed that the National Army entered Xiangyang and Nanzhang at about 3:00 PM on the 5th.

<h3>Railway Freight Rates Adjusted Today; Handled by Region According to the Business Situation of Each Railway; Appropriate Discounts Given for Third and Fourth Class Passenger Tickets</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Ministry of Transportation News: The Ministry of Transportation is studying the formula for adjusting railway freight rates in accordance with Article 5 of the Implementation Regulations of the General Budget for the Second Half of the Year passed by the Legislative Yuan: "The fees of state-run transportation enterprises, unless otherwise stipulated by law, may be appropriately increased with reference to costs, but the percentage of the increase shall be lower than the general price index, and the state treasury may provide subsidies if necessary, all of which must be approved by the Executive Yuan." However, before the formula is approved, the price of coal has recently skyrocketed. The purchase price of Kailuan coal in Shanghai in July was 32,984,000 yuan per ton, and it will rise to 81,500,000 yuan starting in August. In July, the salaries of employees were also greatly increased according to the regulations of the central government, and the losses of various railways are extremely large. The Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting has passed a temporary adjustment starting from the 6th of this month. However, this adjustment of freight rates is handled by region according to the business situation of each railway, and in order to reduce the burden on the people, appropriate discounts are given for the freight rates of daily necessities and third and fourth class passenger tickets. The adjustment method for each railway is based on the average pre-war base number of passengers and goods, multiplied by the following multiples: passenger tickets, a minimum of 500,000 times and a maximum of 1,000,000 times; freight, a minimum of 1,250,000 times and a maximum of 2,500,000 times. (Ticket prices for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways are published on page 4)</p>
<h3>Domestic Airmail Rates Adjusted from the 9th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Directorate General of Posts is now adjusting domestic airmail rates from the 9th due to the increase in air freight rates by 34%.

<h3>Regarding the Issue of Public Utilities Price Hikes</h3>
<p>Since mid-July, the general price level in Shanghai has barely stabilized, and some prices have even started to decline. Ordinary citizens initially thought that the surge in prices might finally come to a halt, and were pleasantly surprised. However, those with foresight were already worried about how long this "short break" in price increases could last. As we expected, public utilities, which are most closely related to people's daily lives, suddenly announced new prices for August: water prices rose approximately threefold compared to the previous month, electricity prices rose by about one and a half to three times, gas prices rose by about one and a half to two and a half times, telephone prices rose by about one and a half to four times, and tram and bus fares also rose by about three times. The magnitude of these public utility price hikes is truly shocking! To put it plainly: for those with installed telephones, a single phone call costs 200,000 to 300,000 yuan; using a borrowed phone costs 500,000 yuan, and can even reach one million yuan. A ride on a tram or bus now costs at least 140,000 yuan, and longer distances cost 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. How can ordinary citizens survive this? This sudden surge in public utility prices will inevitably affect the prices of general goods and the cost of living for workers, and unfortunately, it may trigger a future "August price storm." While the municipal authorities may believe they have done their best, the general public naturally feels overwhelmed. The city councilors' request to convene a special session of the city council to discuss this major issue is, in fact, a necessary appeal on behalf of the citizens.</p>
<p>However, when discussing an issue, we must remain calm and objective. Especially those in charge should take a broad view and consider the overall situation. The current price hikes in public utilities, which affect the lives of every citizen, do not seem to be the responsibility of the municipal authorities. Everyone knows that public utilities are essential for people's daily lives. People's clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all related to public utilities. Every price increase is equivalent to increasing the burden on people's daily lives. Public utilities in all countries are regarded as services for the community and the public, and should not be compared with ordinary profit-making enterprises. Therefore, every price adjustment should consider whether the people can afford it. During the general meeting of the Shanghai City Council in February and March of this year, in order to stabilize society and prices, several resolutions were passed regarding public utilities. It was also suggested that a public utility investigation committee be established to investigate the revenue and expenditure and operating conditions of various companies, as a reference for whether to allow price increases. On the proactive side, it was suggested assisting the municipal government in finding ways to reduce the costs of public utilities, such as advocating for quarterly foreign exchange settlements or storage of oil and fuel required by public utilities, and requesting the central government to adopt subsidy policies when necessary. This call was made because whether or not these services raise prices can affect the whole situation. However, the central government repeatedly stated that the City Council did not have the authority to investigate public utilities, and ordered them not to interfere. The subsidy policy was insisted to not be restored. During this period, the foreign exchange system changed, and the market price of foreign exchange certificates fluctuated several times a month, even several times a week. Although the Central Bank has tried its best to provide assistance and lend huge sums of money, these piecemeal measures ultimately do not solve the problem. Moreover, the central government insisted that public utilities must be the first to implement the cost-based price adjustment system, regarding it as the "treasure" of "scientific price adjustment," as if other industries could be unscientific, while public utilities are exceptional. Under these circumstances, how can public utility prices not rise?</p>
<p>We absolutely do not want to defend the price increases of public utilities. It is true that some companies among the public utilities in this city may have excessive expenses, lax management, or unreasonable cost calculations, and there must be many areas that need improvement. Moreover, whether the new prices approved by the municipal government this time are reasonable is indeed still open to discussion. However, while the City Council is reviewing this issue, we cannot help but ask the citizens, the government, and various companies to face a realistic problem, and then jointly seek solutions.</p>
<p>What is the realistic problem? That is, what is the main reason for this price increase? We believe that the main reason for the large increase in public utility prices this time is the change in the government's foreign exchange policy. Before the end of May, the government used the exchange equalization fund rate for foreign exchange settlements. Since the beginning of June, foreign exchange certificates have been used. Therefore, the exchange rate for US dollars at the end of May was 474 (thousand yuan), but it rose to 2,474 (thousand yuan) at the end of June, and then jumped to 4,879 (thousand yuan) at the end of July. In other words, it increased by 4.24 times at the end of June compared to the end of May, and increased by 0.97 times at the end of July compared to the end of June, which is an increase of 10.3 times compared to the end of May. It is said that 40% of the fuel and materials required for public utility expenditures need foreign exchange, so it will undoubtedly be affected by this tenfold surge in foreign exchange in two months. The second reason is the increase in the cost of living index for employees. At the end of July, it was more than four times higher than at the end of May, which will inevitably affect 20% of public utility expenditures. If we compare these two increases with the increase in public utilities in the two months, then the discussion may be closer to the real problem.</p>
<p>However, in any case, if the central and local authorities only know how to raise the general foreign exchange rate, and are unwilling to provide remedial measures for public utilities that are related to all production industries, we can expect that this vicious cycle of rising prices will be difficult to contain. Not only will public utilities suffer, but the lives of the people will also become more and more difficult. Everyone should not underestimate the problem of public utility price increases. If we continue to ignore reality and let it run its course, it may lead to even greater consequences!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Director Dong Xian Guang responded to inquiries at a press conference on the 5th as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What decisions were made at the meeting between the President and high-ranking generals? Was the assignment of tasks for the newly trained troops discussed and decided? Were there any changes in command during or as a result of the meeting?</p>
<p>(Answer) High-ranking generals did not hold a meeting. Currently, the Ministry of National Defense's military education conference is being held in Nanjing.</p>
<p>(Question) When will Neiji Okamura be tried? What kind of court will try him? What are the charges brought by the prosecutor? How was Okamura listed as a war criminal for investigation and prosecution? Whose order was this based on?</p>
<p>(Answer) Neiji Okamura will be tried by the War Criminals Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The date of his trial will be announced by the tribunal. The indictment issued by the military tribunal prosecutor on August 2 contains detailed explanations of Okamura's crimes and the process of investigation and prosecution.

<p>(Question) The Communist bandits falsely accused the National Army of destroying river dikes. What is the truth?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Communist bandits falsely accused the National Army of destroying the Yellow River dike repair project, distorting the truth and confusing the public. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources has listed the facts to refute this. The National Army is gathered on the south bank of the Yellow River. If a breach were to occur, it would not only affect the safety of the people along the river, but also cause huge damage to the National Army. Therefore, the National Army not only did not destroy the dikes, but is currently protecting the construction of river dikes in the Gaozhuangji area.</p>

<h3>Quartermaster General Headquarters Finance Department Announces Status of Military Expenditure Distribution; New Method for Salary Distribution to be Implemented After Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Since April of this year, the Finance Department of the Quartermaster General Headquarters has adjusted the cost-of-living index for civil and military personnel on a monthly basis. However, official salaries could not be paid in full at once, which led to inquiries from officers and soldiers from time to time. In order to make all officers and soldiers aware of the status of military expenditure distribution and the reasons for distributing salaries in installments, the department has issued the following statement regarding the status of military expenditure distribution:</p>
<p>1. The original regulation for the date of salary distribution to the National Army units was the end of each month, and the distribution had to be completed by the 5th of the following month at the latest. For the new system troops, the regulation was to distribute salaries twice a month, from the 15th to the 30th.</p>
<p>2. The military expenditures are requested by the Finance Department from the Ministry of Finance and transferred to the various supply units, and then transferred to the various troops. This requires complicated procedures and a long period of time. At the same time, because the Ministry of Finance must consider the funds prepared by the national treasury to meet the huge expenditures, the military expenditures have always been allocated in advance by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, the payments cannot be made all at once, and are paid in installments.</p>
<p>3. After the treatment of officers and soldiers is adjusted monthly according to the cost-of-living index, the index standard must be approved and announced at the end of each month. The funds that the Ministry of Finance intends to issue also have to be allocated in installments based on the previous indices. Take the July expenses as an example. The first allocation was calculated based on the original index of 420,000 times for June (in fact, this batch was allocated in four installments). The second time, because the approved index for June was too low, an order was received to borrow half a month's salary, equivalent to an index of 210,000 times. The Ministry of Finance issued the payment order on July 19, and after sending it to the Ministry of Audit for approval, the Finance Department transferred the funds to the various supply agencies on July 19 for distribution. The third time, after the July cost-of-living index was determined to be 1.6 million times, in addition to the 630,000 times that had already been issued, another 980,000 times had to be paid. This index was decided at the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on July 31. The Executive Yuan's order was issued and reached the Ministry of Finance on August 2. The Finance Department received the payment order from the Ministry of Finance on August 3, sent it to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank for deposit, and planned to transfer all the funds to the local supply agencies on August 5.</p>
<p>4. The Jiuguo Daily published on July 31 that the troops had only received 630,000 times the salary, and had not received 1.55 million times. In fact, the troops only received 630,000 times, because the Executive Yuan ordered that before the new index was determined, they could only borrow the old index of 630,000 times. As for the 1.6 million times the cost of the new index, we had to wait until the Ministry of Finance received the money on the 4th before we could deposit the money and issue it. The newspaper mistakenly reported 1.55 million times because the index had not been officially determined when it was published on July 31. At that time, the Ministry of Finance could not allocate the funds because it had not received the order, and the Finance Department could not request and transfer the funds.</p>
<p>5. This department has strived to distribute the salaries of officers and soldiers on time and quickly. Now, based on the Ministry of Finance's allocation period and the monthly cost-of-living index, we have formulated the following measures for the distribution of salaries to the troops: (1) Before August 10, a one-time loan will be issued based on the approved index for the previous two months (August according to June). (2) Before the end of this month, a one-time supplement will be issued based on the approved index for the previous month. (3) Before the 20th of the following month, the salary for this month will be issued based on the approved index for this month.</p>
<p>The above measures are a great improvement over the previous regulation of issuing salaries once a month at the end of each month. By the end of the current month, the index for the previous month can be supplemented and clearly issued, and by the 20th of the following month, the index for this month can be supplemented and reissued.

<h3>Council of the United Relief Headquarters Approves Several Loan Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The United Relief Headquarters held its 369th council meeting on the morning of the 5th, chaired by Weng Wenhao. All council members attended. It was approved that postal remittances of family support funds by officers and soldiers of troops in the war zones should, in principle, be exempted from remittance fees to show preferential treatment. However, as the postal service incurs significant losses from these remittances, the Central Bank should provide convenience for allocation to subsidize these losses. Detailed measures will be proposed by the Secretariat in conjunction with the Central Bank and the Postal Remittance Bureau for approval. In addition, proposals for shipping loans, engineering loans for various railway bureaus, and loans for the transportation and sale of civilian grain in Taiyuan and Jinan were also approved.</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly Battle Situation: Only Sporadic Contact Except for Taiyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the weekly battle situation from July 29th to August 4th as follows:</p>
<p>During this week of fighting, apart from the National Army in Taiyuan, which is still engaged in combat with the bandits due to launching counterattacks against the periphery, only sporadic contact occurred in other areas. Although the bandits have made movements in the Northeast and around Baoding and Jinan, their actual purpose is to cover the main force's recuperation and replenishment. They do not yet have the strength for large-scale reckless actions in the short term. Details of the situation are described below:</p>
<p>1.  North China Battlefield</p>
<p>Taiyuan Area: The National Army is gradually launching counterattacks against the bandits. Important strongholds on the periphery, such as Niejiashan (30 li west of Taiyuan), Nantun (20 li southwest of Taiyuan), and Xiaodianzhen (40 li south of Taiyuan), have all been recovered by the National Army one by one. The Baijiazhuang coal mine north of Niejiashan has recently resumed production, and the threat from the bandit army has been completely lifted. Our air force has been flying to Pingyao, Qixian, and Taigu for several days, launching fierce bombardments against the bandit army's headquarters and areas where looted materials are stockpiled, causing heavy losses to the bandits. The bandits attacking Bingyuan are facing supply difficulties, and their combat power has been greatly weakened. Under the fierce attacks of our coordinated land and air forces, the bandit army has shown signs of retreat.</p>
<p>Eastern Hebei Area: The bandits are frequently moving between Fengrun and Qian'an, and once made a probing raid on the Tangyu section. However, the National Army's deployment is strict. In addition to dispatching the air force to bomb the main force of the Nie bandits moving in the Zunhua, Yutian, and Qian'an triangle area, it also sent a large army to attack Fengrun, which was recaptured at noon on the 3rd. Currently, no new battles are occurring in the Eastern Hebei area.</p>
<p>Central Hebei Area: There have been no significant battles along the Pingbao line recently. However, parts of the 2nd and 3rd Columns of the Nie bandits, and the main force of the 6th and 7th Columns, are roaming around Baoding, claiming that they will attack Baoyuan. However, the National Army has made preparations. If the bandits recklessly attempt to succeed, they will inevitably suffer the same fate as the 8th and 11th Columns of the Eastern Hebei bandits, being severely defeated.</p>
<p>2. East China Battlefield</p>
<p>Central Shandong Area: The bandit forces around Jinan consist of the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 13th Bohai Columns, and the New 7th and New 11th Divisions. Although the bandits are deliberately feigning an imminent reckless action, they have not dared to rashly attack under the surveillance of our land and air forces.</p>
<p>Northern Anhui Area: The main forces of the Chen Yi bandit's 3rd, 4th, 8th, 11th, and Liangguang Rapid Columns are still wandering in the triangle area of Boxian, Taihe, and Guoyang. A week ago, due to pressure from the National Army in the Suxian and Yongcheng areas, part of the bandits fled to Zaoyang. The Fuyang garrison and militia, following orders to adapt to strategic needs and strike the bandits' military strength, cleared the area, protecting the people and safely moving to designated locations, and cooperated with the pursuing National Army to attack the bandits in Xugang. As for the scattered bandits on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, they have been completely driven back by our army. In addition, in the Northern Jiangsu area, the remnants of the Chen bandits' 2nd and 12th Columns once planned to sneak through the outskirts of Suining and move towards Lingbi and Suxian in Anhui Province. Later, when our large army of the Jinpu Railway launched an attack, the bandits fled back in panic towards the Yanghe (southeast of Suqian) direction, and part of them fled to the vicinity of Qianji (south of Shuyang) to cause disturbances. Currently, our large armies from the north and south are launching a pincer attack on the bandit forces. The remnants of the Chen bandits' 11th Column are recuperating and replenishing in the area south of Dongtai, with no significant activity recently. As for Feng and Pei counties, which were once occupied by the bandits, they have been successively recovered by our army.</p>
<p>3. Central China Battlefield</p>
<p>Northern Hubei Area: The purpose of our various National Army units is to strike the bandit army that retreated from the Xiangfan area, so they did not rush to recover Xiangyang City, but conducted a "capture battle" in the periphery of Xiangfan, searching for the main force of the Liu bandits. Currently, more than half of the bandits have fled to southwestern Henan, and the rest are scattered everywhere and will be severely attacked by our army. Nanzhang, southwest of Xiangyang, is currently being besieged by our army and will be recovered soon. Xiangyang City has long been under our army's control. As for the Central Plains Independent Brigade of bandits that disturbed Anlu in Central Hubei, it has been defeated by our army, and Anlu was also recaptured by our army on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Western Henan Area: A part of our powerful units penetrated deep into the suburbs of Luoyang for a surprise attack to scout the enemy's rear situation. As a result, the mission was accomplished, and the entire force returned, with many gains along the way. As for the local militia in Western Wan, they are brave and capable, with their heroic spirit undiminished. They are currently cooperating with the National Army to search and suppress the remaining bandits in areas such as Xixiakou, so that the western mountainous areas of the four counties in Western Wan can also be restored. Currently, our National Army on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway is continuously launching sweeping battles towards Wuyang Fuqiu, leaving the Liu bandits' 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns, etc., who are entrenched in the area, with no time to recuperate and replenish.</p>
<p>In addition, the National Army in Shaanxi has penetrated deep into the Huanglong Mountain area to search and suppress bandits, and the National Army in the Northeast is expanding its control over areas such as southern and western Liaoning. As there are no major battles, no further details will be given.</p>
<p>General Political Department of the Navy Announces Situation of Coastal and River Defenses in the Past Week</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The General Political Department of the Navy recently announced the situation of coastal and river defenses in the past week as follows: In the past week, in the river defense aspect, the bandit army assembly area at Longshaogang in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was bombarded by our gunboats, killing at least 200 bandits. At the same time, it covered the army and local teams to capture the bandit army's position at Longshaogang. The remnant bandits were unable to resist and collapsed, fleeing to Tianxingqiao. An unknown number of bandits were immediately routed after being attacked by our ships. When the bandits retreated, they abducted seven local Baozhangs. Our motorized boat team cooperated with the army to attack the bandit army in the area west of Jianting and east of Taojialin in Northern Jiangsu from both wings. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandit army was unable to resist and fled in disarray. Thirty bandits, 20 rifles, and 10 wooden boats were captured, 100 bandits were killed, and 50 bandits were wounded. After completing its mission, our motorized boat team turned to attack the bandit army at Hudu Jianyangzhen. The bandit army strongholds near the town were cleared one by one by our army, and there were no traces of bandits. In addition to arresting 10 bandit cadres, 20 wooden boats and some materials were seized. As for the coastal defense aspect, the bandit army's onshore positions in the Weihaiwei Qijiazhuang Zhudao and Shidao areas were continuously bombarded by our gunboats, completely destroying and burning them. Our ships patrolling the Jinshan Port area captured a sailboat outside the port, carrying 20 plainclothes soldiers of unknown units and many rifles, pistols, and grenades. Later, when the patrol ship was 20 li outside Liugong Island, a similar speedboat suddenly appeared, carrying 30 plainclothes soldiers. As their identities could not be verified, to prevent the bandits from taking the opportunity to harass, they were ordered to be arrested. In the areas of Bajiangkou and Shidao in Yantai, three bandit ships supplying materials to the bandit army have been captured, totaling 56 boxes of bandit materials, 14 sacks of hemp bags, and 100 barrels of diesel.</p>

<h3>British, American, and French Governments to Send Notes to the Soviet Union, Agreeing to Hold Four-Power Conference; Three Special Envoys Ordered to Meet Molotov Again to Determine Location, Date, and Agenda</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] London, 5th (Broadcast): According to news from diplomatic circles in Paris, the French government has sent instructions regarding the Four-Power negotiations in Moscow to the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chataigneau. This news proves that the Western countries have decided to take the next diplomatic step regarding the Berlin issue. It is said that the French government's instructions indicate that the Western Three-Power envoys will hold new negotiations with Molotov, the content of which is related to the time, location, and agenda of the possible Four-Power conference.</p>
<p>[News from this newspaper] San Francisco, 5th (Broadcast): It is rumored that the British, American, and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union have received new instructions to continue negotiations with the Soviet side. The U.S. State Department neither confirms nor denies this.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] Sources with access to information claim that the Western Three-Power special envoys may send notes to the Soviet government tonight, stating that the Three-Power governments agree to hold a Four-Power conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Sources with access to information claim that British Foreign Secretary Bevin received a report from the British special envoy to Moscow, Roberts, this morning. This is his second report since arriving in Moscow. In the report, Roberts described the meeting he held yesterday with French Ambassador Chataigneau and U.S. Ambassador Smith. According to informed sources, the Three-Power representatives convened the meeting last night after receiving Bevin's telegram requesting the meeting. After receiving the report, Bevin immediately held discussions with the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, and the French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, this morning. It is heard that Bevin will send another telegram to Roberts tonight. Furthermore, the British Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Robertson, recently came to London to confer with Bevin and will return to Germany today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, like the British Foreign Office and the U.S. State Department, is also strictly guarding the secrets of the Four-Power negotiations. In general, it is believed that unless the Western countries withdraw their agreement on the establishment of a West German government in Frankfurt from the London Conference, the Soviet Union will allow the lifting of the blockade of Berlin. American public opinion does not seem surprised by the possible change in the consistently firm policy. Officials at the French Foreign Ministry believe that the Soviet Union's desire for an agreement is no less than that of the Western countries, so the future is still optimistic. According to unofficial sources, Moscow and London may release some details of the conference within two days.</p>
<h3>New Currency Issued in East Germany; Soviet Union Agrees to Unfreeze It; Traffic Allowed Between Berlin and Leipzig</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] New York, 5th (Broadcast): It is reported that the Soviet Union has agreed to unfreeze the currency issued by the Soviet side. It is said that the Berlin City Council and the German Economic Commission, supported by the Soviet Union, held a meeting on the afternoon of the 5th and reached an agreement. This agreement specifically stated that it was a "temporary measure." Financial figures in Britain and the United States warned against being too optimistic about this matter. Western countries fear that the Soviet Union feels it has made too many concessions, and as a result, will adopt a stronger attitude in future meetings.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 5th] The Berlin municipal government refused the Soviet Union's demand on the 5th. According to the Soviet Union's demand, the municipal government should announce that the Eastern Mark issued by the Soviet Union is the only legal currency for the municipal government and the entire economic livelihood of Berlin. If so, the economy of Berlin would be entirely under Soviet control. The Western occupying countries have agreed that 750,000 workers in the Western sector will be paid 75% of their wages in Soviet-issued Marks and 25% in Western-issued Marks. The reason the municipal government refused the Soviet Union's demand is that this matter would hand over the entire city of Berlin to the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities further used the freezing of the Soviet-system currency funds of the municipal government and Western industries and commerce as a means to achieve their demand to control Berlin's finances. As a result, the salaries for the second half of July for 750,000 workers could not be issued. Germans are asking the Western countries to supply as much Western currency as possible to counter the Soviet Union's actions. However, as the talks in Moscow are still continuing, it is difficult to take this direct action. In addition, it is believed that the Soviet Union's condition for lifting the Berlin blockade is economic control of Berlin, so the situation is even more complicated. The Soviet Union allowed trains from the Western sector to pass through to the Leipzig Exhibition on the 5th, raising doubts about whether the blockade is still effective. The Soviet-system "Berlin Daily" admitted that the Berlin-Helmstedt railway had been closed to Western traffic for 47 days due to "technical reasons", but it is still available. It also said that 43 special trains will be used to transport Western tourists to Leipzig. The American-system "Daily" reported that a railway spokesman said that special trains from the Western sector to Leipzig will pass through Helmstedt and enter the Soviet zone.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Blockade of Berlin Has Backfired</h3>
<p>Food Shortages and Trade Stagnation in the Soviet Zone</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 4th] The result of the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin has affected the economy of the Soviet zone itself. The industries and commerce of the Soviet zone, which account for 30% of all of Germany, have been severely hit by the stagnation of inter-regional trade.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The Berlin correspondent for The Times said today that serious food shortages have been reported in the Soviet zone of Germany. Several food riots have occurred there, and many rioters have been arrested. One of the reasons for the insufficient food storage is the result of collecting food to transport it to Berlin. The message also confirmed earlier external doubts about whether the Soviet Union has the ability to supply the entire city of Berlin with food. Riots have occurred in Chemnitz in Saxony and Rudolstadt in Thuringia. Furthermore, in the city of Westerode, people have crossed the Czech border in search of food.</p>
<h3>Truman Denies Saying Clay Will Be Removed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman met with Marshall today to review the latest developments in East-West talks during the Berlin crisis. At 10:30 this morning, he frankly denied to reporters the news instigated by the Soviet Union that U.S. Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Lieutenant General Clay, would be dismissed. At the same time, Army Secretary Royal also made the same denial.</p>
<h3>United States Proposes Counter-Proposal on Danube River Navigation Management Issues, Advocating Establishment of International Organization Under United Nations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 5th] U.S. Chief Representative Cannon today proposed a counter-proposal to the Danube River Treaty at the Danube River Conference being held here, to counter the Soviet Union's proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 5th] The United States today accused the Soviet Union of monopolizing the Danube River at the Danube River Conference, and suggested establishing an international authority under the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 4th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky insisted on the principles of free navigation and respect for the sovereignty of Danube River countries at the Danube River Conference today. Yugoslav Representative Bebler and Czech Representative Clementis both supported him. Vyshinsky strongly stated that the Soviet Union's proposal can strengthen the economic and cultural unity between the countries of the Danube River. He strongly criticized the inappropriateness of Britain and France insisting on the 1921 Convention. He said, "Of the two committees established under the 1921 Convention, one is organized by non-Danube River countries, and the other is only attended by Romania. How can the sovereignty of Danube River countries be guaranteed? The Soviet Union maintains that the Danube River Committee can only be composed of all Danube River countries." Bebler also attacked the Western countries for taking advantage of the division of the Danube River countries themselves to occupy the Danube River. He announced full support for the Soviet Union's proposal. Clementis also supported the Soviet Union's proposal to end the control of the Danube River by non-Danube River countries.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Refute Yugoslav Accusations Regarding Trieste Port Issue</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Success Lake, 4th] Ignoring the Cominform's condemnation of Tito, the Soviet Union seems to still support Yugoslavia's complaints against Britain and the United States regarding the administration of the Port of Trieste. Today, Ukrainian Representative Manuilsky at the Security Council supported Yugoslavia's position, believing that Yugoslavia has full rights to file complaints against Britain and the United States for violating international obligations at the Port of Trieste. U.S. Representative Jessup and British Representative Jebb strongly stated that Yugoslavia's accusations were unfounded, and pointed out that the Allied Military Government of the Port of Trieste has submitted reports to the Security Council on a regular basis, while Yugoslavia has never submitted reports on its mysterious administrative region. Yugoslav Representative Vilfan accused Britain and the United States of undermining the unity of the Port of Trieste, supporting elements that undermine the relationship between the British and American occupation zones and the Yugoslav occupation zone, and linking the economy of the British and American occupation zones to Italy. He said that ensuring the independence of the Port of Trieste is the responsibility of the Security Council. At this point, under the suggestion of French Representative Parodi, the Security Council adjourned the meeting to continue discussions next week.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Special Session Passes Adjournment Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Southern Democrats' five-day filibuster against the poll tax bill ended at 4:35 PM today. Before the end, the Republicans admitted defeat and agreed to abandon this politically explosive bill, and began to take action only on a small part of President Truman's anti-inflation plan. The removal of the poll tax issue from the Senate agenda was due to an adjournment vote, not a vote to adjourn today and reopen tomorrow. This move eliminates any proposals under discussion, so the poll tax issue is still in the process of being proposed to become legislation. The adjournment vote was 69 votes to 16 votes, and the efforts of government-sent Democratic congressmen were ineffective.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Attacks Currie for Favoring the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>Currie Says Espionage Case is an Act of Aggression</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Currie, a former administrative assistant to U.S. President Roosevelt, who has recently been severely criticized in U.S. Congressional hearings for allegedly assisting Communist secret activities, issued a statement today stating that the accusations are "purely inaccurate acts of aggression and sarcasm." Currie said that he has not yet been summoned by the Commission on Un-American Activities, but he sincerely hopes to be summoned by the Commission "so that he can immediately deny the allegations." O'Donnell, publisher of the New York Daily News and its columnist, also attacked Currie's influence on wartime U.S. policy toward China, favoring the Chinese Communists, in his special edition discussing evidence of Communist espionage, saying that after Currie and Wallace went to China, White House leaders began to aid the Chinese Communists while being cold to Chairman Chiang. When Wallace went to China, he was accompanied by Lattimore, who was hired by Currie, and State Department official Vincent, who was later publicly accused of implementing America's leftist policy toward China.</p>

<h3>American Sunbathing Club Holds Nude Convention; All 400 Members Stark Naked</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] People in the United States who believe in the "Return to Nature Movement" are holding their first national convention since 1939. They call themselves "Sunbathers", but are usually referred to as "Nudists". They are connected by membership in the American Sunbathing Association. It is heard that 400 members of the association, "stark naked", are gathering in a broadly expressed 2,000-acre park surrounded by high walls in New Jersey to jointly discuss strategies on how to win over comrades who believe in nudism. The conference lasts for five days, and in addition to holding two meetings each day, various sports competitions are also held. Foreigners are unable to explore the situation due to the ban of "Anyone wearing any clothing is not allowed to enter without special permission". According to Dr. Boone, a 69-year-old pioneer of the American nudist movement and the association's public relations director, everyone's clothing must be reduced to the bare minimum.</p>
<h3>Hiroshima Mayor Issues Peace Declaration</h3>

This declaration will be read at the memorial meeting tomorrow. The letter said, "Our only enemy on the third anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima is war. Anyone who has experienced the atomic bombing knows that the use of atomic power in future wars will undoubtedly annihilate mankind." Attached to the letter is a peace declaration, which states: War is an inhumane and destructive act, and its harm to human life is greater than everything else, and one war often leads to another, more vicious war. We believe that the phrase "survival of the fittest" is not the truth.</p>

<h3>Looking to the Future of Berlin (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Yanshi</p>
<p>Berlin is currently divided into four occupied zones: Soviet, British, American, and French. At the end of the war, Berlin could still be considered unified. At that time, the Germans all worked under the direction of the representatives of the four-power military government. Now, the municipal government is split, and the reason for this is naturally the Soviet Union's refusal to recognize the Western powers' jurisdiction in Berlin.</p>
<p>The differences in opinion between the two sides have created the Berlin crisis. The Berlin events have greatly threatened public services in the Western powers' occupied areas. Because the Soviet Union holds a large number of underground tunnel facilities, the underground passages in the Western powers' occupied areas are in an abnormal state, because the Soviet Union cut off the electricity from the Soviet occupied area, which reduced the electricity in the Western powers' occupied area by 75%. The electricity currently used is only 25% of the normal level.</p>
<p>Most of Berlin's industries are concentrated in the Western sector, while most of the workers in the Western sector live in the Soviet occupied sector. The output of factories in this area, electrical equipment accounts for half of the country's total, and clothing accounts for 40% of the country's total. Now, due to the lack of raw materials, insufficient power supply, and inconvenient transportation, Berlin's industries are in a state of paralysis.</p>
<p>The food supply in Berlin used to be allocated to retailers by the Allied Commission, but now it has also been split. The Soviet occupied sector is supplied by the Soviet Union, and the Western occupied sector is supplied by Western countries. Because the Soviet Union does not supply fresh milk and fresh vegetables, and has cut off the Western countries' supply routes for food, coal, and other goods to Berlin, the food supply in Berlin has become a problem.</p>
<p>Transportation is undoubtedly the "key" to controlling Berlin. The Soviet authorities used this point to exercise their power to control Western land and water transportation to Berlin. Although the Soviet Union used a series of "reasons" to explain the cause of the "blockade," the people of Berlin understand that the purpose of the blockade is nothing more than the Soviet Union wanting to drive the Western powers out of Berlin.</p>
<p>If the Western sector of Berlin does not have Soviet supplies, then the area will need 6,000 tons of supplies from the outside every day, including 2,000 tons of food, 2,000 tons of coal, and 2,000 tons of other materials. As of June 1948, the food in warehouses and shops in West Berlin was estimated to be able to maintain the needs of three weeks.</p>
<p>Because land and water transportation are controlled, the Western powers have implemented large-scale airlift operations to meet the needs. However, 200 American C-54 transport aircraft can only transport a maximum of 2,000 tons of food and other materials per day. The Western powers plan to have 400 transport aircraft participate in this airlift organization, but it is expected that only a portion of these 400 aircraft will be large transport aircraft. Therefore, when severe winter comes, Berlin will need a large amount of coal and other materials, and even if the two airports in West Berlin are used for transportation, it may be difficult to maintain the balance of "supply and demand."</p>
<p>It is not impossible for the Soviet Union and the Western powers to reach a new agreement to govern Berlin in the near future. However, this agreement still offers very little hope for the Western powers' troops to remain in Berlin. Although both sides are currently trying to avoid war, there is no doubt that this Berlin event is "shortening" the distance to a third world war.

<h3>Passenger and Freight Fares Increased; Maximum of Five Times Higher, Effective This Morning; Current Billing Method Cancelled, All Fares Calculated Based on Mileage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, effective from midnight today, to adjust passenger and freight fares. Passenger fares will be calculated by multiplying the pre-war fare of 1.5 li per kilometer by 900,000, and the current zone-based billing method will be cancelled, with ticket prices calculated based on the actual mileage between stations. Therefore, the new ticket prices are approximately three to five times the current prices. Freight fares will be calculated by multiplying the pre-war fare of 2 fen per kilometer per 10 kilograms by 2,000,000, which is approximately twice the current price.

<h3>Labor-Management Dispute at China Machinery Plant; No Results After Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Workers at the No. 1 Manufacturing Plant (formerly Toyota Plant) of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company in this city, and the workers at the No. 1 Manufacturing Branch Plant (formerly Donghua Plant) of the same system, went on strike on the 3rd due to a dispute over treatment.

The workers put forward four requests: (1) Pay salaries two days in advance, on the 2nd and 17th of each month, (2) Provide lunch, otherwise, the plant should subsidize the food cost by a minimum base of 2 yuan per table, (3) All wages above the index of 30 north should be calculated at 90%, and (4) Request the plant to build worker dormitories and provide housing subsidies before construction. The plant responded to the above requests as follows: (1) The salary payment date can be advanced to the 3rd and 18th, (2) The supply of lunch must be requested from the head office, (3) Cannot be accepted, and (4) It will be considered after the plant has a surplus at the end of the year.

<h3>Trams and Buses Raise Prices on the First Day; Passenger Volume Decreases on All Lines; Forced to Get Off the Bus; Transportation Company is Calculating Passengers Without Tickets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The new bus and tram fares for August in this city were implemented yesterday. Due to the excessive increase in multiples, the citizens complained a lot, and some passengers did not know the new prices were so high beforehand. The fare they brought was not enough to buy a ticket, so many people were forced to get off the bus. Since yesterday afternoon, the passenger volume on each line has generally decreased, and it is expected that this situation will become more obvious today and tomorrow. In order to accurately calculate the ratio of passengers without tickets to the total transportation volume, the Public Utilities Bureau's Public Transportation Company has been using four types of free tickets since yesterday: "military," "police," "public," and "seasonal." All soldiers, police officers, public school staff, and monthly and seasonal ticket passengers who do not buy tickets will be given free tickets separately after boarding the bus. This method is intended to be used for a week to collect statistics. However, according to an expert who has studied public transportation, based on past experience, after a fare increase, there will inevitably be a period of reduction in ordinary passengers, and it will have no impact on passengers without tickets. Moreover, the multiple of this increase is very high. Before ordinary passengers get used to the high fares in the short term, there will be a significant decrease, and passengers without tickets will definitely remain the same. Therefore, if you want to count passengers without tickets during this period, the result will be an alarming percentage, and this percentage is not absolutely accurate.</p>
<h3>Special Broadcast; Father's Day the Day After Tomorrow; Fundraising for Tuition Assistance</h3>
<p>The 8th is the fourth Father's Day. In order to expand the commemoration, the Father's Day Promotion Committee of this city will hold a special broadcast at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, inviting the leaders of all sectors of the city to give speeches, broadcast famous songs, dramas, and musical programs. At the same time, it will also solicit donations for tuition assistance from all sectors of society to help poor students. Who does not have parents, who does not have children? On this Father's Day, everyone should be more self-conscious, celebrate the health of their fathers or cherish the kindness of their fathers. The most meaningful thing to do is to donate tuition assistance to help out-of-school youth. This newspaper sincerely hopes that thoughtful readers will generously donate in a timely manner, and can also set their own team names, arrange them in order, and publish them daily. As children, they will feel more meaningful.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Mr. Ying Yongyu, a reader, has been working at the Four Banks Savings Association for 20 years. On August 1, the bank was renamed the United Commercial Reserve Trust Bank, and Mr. Ying was promoted to the accounting section of the general management office. Friends and relatives of Mr. Ying sent congratulations. In order to express his gratitude, Mr. Ying specially spent 20 million yuan on banquets and sent it to this newspaper to subsidize tuition assistance, benefiting all relatives and friends.</p>

<h3>Reporting the Shipment of Flour; Suspicious Export Certificate Discovered; Customs Detains Goods; Urgent Telegram to the Ministry of Food for Investigation</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month, Ding Xingwu from the Yongfengli Customs Brokerage in this city, along with grain merchants Ge Chengqi (from Shandong, residing at Room 461, Garden Hotel, this city) and Wu Jianqi (from Shandong, residing at No. 15 Sijing Road, this city), went to the Jianghai Customs with two export approval certificates from the Ministry of Food to complete the export procedures for a large quantity of flour. When the anti-smuggling section was processing the procedures, it was found that the customs had not received a telegram from the Ministry of Coarse Grains notifying them of the certificates. When the certificate was inspected, it was discovered that the seal of the Ministry of Food printed on it was smaller than the original, and the handwriting was slightly different. Although the seal of the supervisor on the certificate was the same as the certificates previously issued, it was discovered that a character in the name on the seal was different from the original. It was immediately recognized as a forgery. The section dispatched port police to detain Ge and Ding for further interrogation. According to their statements, Ge Chengqi applied to the Qingdao Municipal Government for permission to import 40,000 bags of flour a month ago. The Qingdao Municipal Government approved the import permit for 12,000 bags. Wu Jianqi also applied to the Yantai Municipal Government at the same time for an import permit for 5,000 bags of flour. The two of them jointly entrusted a Sun Zhongyi to work on the export certificate from the Ministry of Food in Nanjing. Sun then entrusted a well-known Western doctor in Nanjing, Tao Youxin, to find a way. Tao then entrusted someone to work on two senior officials in the Ministry of Food's Control Department, and finally obtained this export certificate. As to whether it was a forgery, they did not know the truth. After the customs received the confession, they arrested Sun Zhongyi and sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Food yesterday to investigate the truth of the matter, whether it was a forgery or was indeed issued by the ministry. In addition, because the inside story of the case is complicated, it has been reported to the relevant authorities, and it is expected that the case will be clarified within days.</p>

<h3>A Group of Swindlers Arrived by Plane; Switch Goods to Swindle a Large Quantity of Pens; Case Cracked in Hankou and Sent to Shanghai for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Hankou police authorities recently cracked a major case in Shanghai involving the swindling of a large number of fountain pens. This newspaper has reported on the matter. It is now learned that the arrested suspects have been sent to Shanghai, and the detailed details are as follows.</p>
<p>At around 2:50 PM on the 20th of last month, three customers suddenly came to the Huguang Fountain Pen Shop at No. 704 Hankou Road and selected 152 Parker fountain pens with gold caps, 34 with silver caps, 19 pairs of gold cap pens, 154 vacuum Parker pens, and 12 Waterman pens, totaling 24 billion yuan. The three customers helped with the packing at the time, but secretly switched the goods and declared that the disguised goods would be temporarily stored in the shop. They also asked someone to accompany them to the house of a relative named Jinghua New Village, Julu Road, to collect the money. The shop owner, Zhu Tingjie, went there in person. On the way, two of the three suddenly excused themselves and left. Then he went to the destination with the other person. The man said a few perfunctory words and left without saying goodbye. At this time, Zhu realized that he had been tricked and hurriedly returned to the store to check the goods in the package, only to find that they were all counterfeit goods, completely different from the originals. He immediately reported the matter to the Laozha Police Sub-Bureau for investigation. After receiving the report, Zhao Zhaoding, the chief of the sub-bureau, ordered Director Jiang to start the investigation. It was learned that the group of merchants who talked about the batch of goods were staying at Room 68, Anshang Hotel, Yunnan South Road. Director Song Shaomei led police officers Li Junkun and Ma Xishu to the hotel to search, but found nothing. That night, the case officers guarded at various wharves and stations, and also conducted various investigations, but found nothing. Two days later, a confidential report was suddenly received, saying that the group of criminals, together with the goods, had all fled to Hankou. Director Jiang immediately dispatched police chiefs Sun Zhiliang, Liu Zongjian, and Li Junkun to Hankou by plane to meet with the local police authorities. The male and female criminals Huang Fusheng, Xiao Yuan, Guan Ruiting, Huang Lian (female), Chen Sheng, He Lu, and Chen Zhen (female) were successively arrested at the Central Hotel on Minsheng Road and the Guanshengyuan on Jianghan Road. All the stolen goods were recovered. Yesterday, all the criminals were taken to Shanghai by plane and are now being interrogated. It is also learned that the Zhonghua Fountain Pen Factory at No. 517 Xujiahui Road was recently cheated out of 44 dozen No. 51 fountain pens of this factory, worth a great deal of money, and were also cheated by the same group of criminals using the same method.</p>

Mayor Wu agreed to provide a reasonable solution after the investigation, and the workers withdrew.</p>

Later, to avoid disaster, they came to Shanghai from their hometown. Yuexian's husband, Qin Guangzhong, found out and followed them to Shanghai. He reported the case to the police, who transferred it to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. They were prosecuted on suspicion of disrupting the family. The District Court ruled yesterday that Qin Zhang Yuexian and Hu Jianping each received a sentence of four months of imprisonment, suspended for two years.</p>
<h3>Thirteenth Route Bus: Two Drivers Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at approximately 5:00 PM, a Route 13 bus was traveling from Fenglin Bridge towards the South Wharf. While passing the intersection of Xieqiao and Lujiabang Road, suddenly, over two hundred workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department, who had been lying in wait, arrived in ten trucks, including military trucks numbered 88044 and 88045. Spotting the bus, they rushed forward and stopped it. The driver of bus number 566, Zhou Jinsheng, and another driver, Li Jinpeng, number 963, were dragged off and brutally beaten. Some of the workers were armed with iron bars and other weapons. After the two drivers were beaten and fell to the ground, the workers boarded the trucks and fled in different directions. The two injured drivers were later taken to the hospital for treatment. According to Zhao Fuqi, a ticket inspector from the Route 20 bus company, who testified at the Penglai Police Station, the workers' attack was likely due to previous disputes over fares during bus rides.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters: Opinions on Reforming Party Affairs</h3>
<p>In response to the central government's movement to reform party affairs, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang recently convened several meetings of executive and supervisory committee members, as well as cadres from various district party branches. They have now compiled a written opinion summarizing the various viewpoints, which was submitted to the President and the Central Executive Committee yesterday for consideration. The main points are outlined below: (1) To thoroughly reform party affairs, it is essential to solicit the opinions of the party's extensive grassroots cadres. Therefore, a national representative assembly should be convened, as a small number of senior central cadres are insufficient to bear this responsibility. (2) To revitalize the party's revolutionary spirit, the party should be renamed the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Party, and its political program and policies should be revised. (3) The number of Central Standing Committee members should be limited to a maximum of thirty, elected by the national representative assembly, and a rotating five-member monthly duty system should be established to assist the President in handling party affairs. (4) The center of activity for provincial (municipal) party affairs should be shifted to the county (district) party branches. (5) Party discipline should be strictly enforced, and party members in government should be managed. Anyone found organizing factions within the party should have their initiators identified, expelled from the party, and their organizations dissolved. (6) Firmly pursue the revolutionary tasks of the current stage: completing the suppression of the rebellion, implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood, and establishing a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3>Afflicted by Illness and Misfortune: Ding Guitang's Son Dies</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th] Qu, the daughter-in-law of Ding Guitang, who unsuccessfully attempted suicide by jumping from a building in Kuling, previously went to Jiujiang for treatment.

It has now been learned that Qu's illness has not yet healed, while Ding's son, due to the fatigue of traveling up and down the mountain, suffered a worsening of his condition and passed away in his lodgings in Nanchang.</p>
<h3>Shareholders of Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory Accuse Chairman and Others of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Jin Songcheng, chairman of the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory; Qu Wansheng, the current general manager; and Zhang Diesheng, the former general manager, have recently been sued in court by shareholders Dan Hengjin, Dan Lingyi, Dan Qiuhong, and three others, who accuse them of embezzling equity. According to the plaintiffs, after the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance, they were all in the rear areas, but Guangzhong's business flourished. The defendants, however, used the pretext of increasing capital to deprive the shareholders of their rights and seize company assets. During the occupation period, they also colluded with the Japanese to seize the company's equipment and the shareholders' rights. The defendant Zhang Diesheng has already been indicted by the High Procuratorate on charges of treason, and Zhang has fled to evade punishment. The Guangzhong Factory then appointed Qu Wansheng as the successor manager, who sold the factory's machinery and cloth to newly formed companies such as Xinzhong, Lianzhong, Xingzhong, Hezhong, and Fuzhong, which were established by the defendants themselves, at a price of one-tenth of their value, and embezzled the profits that should have been earned by the company. The case was publicly heard yesterday by Judge Zhong. According to defendant Qu, "Guangzhong Factory established the Erzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the Sanzhong Printing and Dyeing Factory in 1929. On October 15, 1938, the three factories were merged, which required an increase in capital. Later, the company was oppressed by the enemy and puppet regime, and Jin withdrew. The factory affairs were then entirely maintained by Zhang Diesheng. After the victory, the enemy property administration sealed up Guangzhong. After Jin came forward to request the unsealing, it was approved after review. Therefore, the allegations made by the plaintiffs should be the responsibility of Zhang Diesheng and have nothing to do with them," and so on. As a result, the court ordered the case to be adjourned for further review.</p>

<h3>Special Criminal Court Indicts Thirteen Defendants in the Lin-Wang and Other Three Companies' Foreign Exchange Racketeering Case; Zhou Zhendong Not Indicted Due to Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The case of illegal foreign exchange trading and black market gold speculation by Lin-Wang, Sanwei, and Dazhonghua and other three companies has been concluded by Prosecutor Li Yulong of the Special Criminal Court. He believes that the defendants Wang Chunzhe (manager of Lin-Wang Commercial Firm), Lin Tongshi (person in charge of the Shantou branch of Lin-Wang), Zheng Ligong (manager of Lin-Wang), Huang Yuanjue (manager of the foreign trade department of Sanwei Company), Zhang Yansheng (manager of Dazhonghua Film Enterprise Co., Ltd.), and the thirteen fugitives Chu Shunwei, Jiang Boying, Zheng Jiayu, Lin Mingjian, Zheng Tingjiao, Chen Yanquan, Zheng Xianting, and Ke Hai are to be publicly prosecuted. Defendant Zhou Zhendong (employee of Dazhonghua Film Enterprise Co., Ltd.) is not being prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. The following is a record of the facts of the crimes committed by the indicted defendants and the relevant legal provisions:</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime:</p>
<p>Lin-Wang (A) The Lin-Wang Commercial Firm was established by Wang Chunzhe and Lin Tongshi, named after their surnames, at 131 Beijing Road in Shanghai (formerly named Lin-Wang Company). It has a subsidiary, Liansheng Import and Export Company. Wang Chunzhe is the manager, and Zheng Jiayu and Zheng Ligong serve as deputy manager and manager, respectively. Ke Hai is an employee. There is a branch in Shantou, managed by Lin Tongshi and Lin Mingjian. There is also an affiliate in Hong Kong, which commissions Taikun Company Chen Yanquan, Zheng Tingjiao, and Zheng Xianting to act as agents, using the export of gauze and lace as a cover to apply to the government for foreign exchange allocations, engaging in the buying and selling of black market gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, and using telecommunications to operate various foreign exchange transactions. They maintain private black market account books, using classified account names such as "Xiongji," "Zheji," "Yutuo," "Taikun," "Tongrong" (referring to joint operations), and "Lianfa" (referring to the Hong Kong affiliate) to record the amount of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange transactions. They use various codes such as "beans," "sugar," "rice," "flour," and "You" to represent gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, and create coded numbers as methods for transaction settlement, communication, and accounting. Wang Chunzhe maintains checkbooks under the name of Wang Xiong (alias) at the Ruikangcheng Exchange and the Datong Bank, which have the same handwriting, specifically for the purpose of purchasing gold and paying funds. He also assigns Ke Hai to be responsible for purchasing gold, and establishes rooms at the Shanghai YMCA and the Cathay Hotel as secret trading venues. The business area extends to Washington and London. From September 1, 1947, to May 6, 1948, they bought and sold gold and foreign currency and operated foreign exchange business. The verifiable income included a total of HK$1,532,882.07 in Hong Kong dollars and Hong Kong foreign exchange, and a total of HK$1,894,612.06 in Hong Kong dollars and Hong Kong foreign exchange was paid out. The illegal Hong Kong foreign exchange amounted to HK$453,196.3. The income from US dollars and US foreign exchange totaled US$147,666.26, and the payments for US dollars and US foreign exchange totaled US$153,295.26. The illegal US foreign exchange was US$359,075, the illegal British foreign exchange was £10,052, and 196.895 taels of gold were purchased and 196.544 taels were sold. Among them, 1,754 US dollars were exchanged for 30 taels of gold, and 10.325 taels of gold were exchanged for 557 US dollars. Wang Chunzhe also used the foreign currency earned from business to privately purchase linen, refrigerators, tires, and other imported goods in the United States, Britain, Belgium, and other places, which were imported without the approval of the Import and Export Management Committee, in an attempt to make profits.</p>
<p>Sanwei</p>
<p>(B) Sanwei Company: It has been found that the company was solely funded by Chu Shunwei, who hired Huang Yuanjue as the manager of the foreign trade department, responsible for managing import and export business. There is also a branch in Hong Kong. Since February 17, 1947, and then July 18, December 18, and December 25 of the same year, the Central Bank's Provisional Measures for Managing Foreign Exchange, the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion, and the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management were promulgated and implemented. They successively applied to the Transportation Management Committee for approval of foreign exchange totaling US$10,406.71 in the name of the company to engage in foreign trade. The two discussed and deliberately violated the regulations on foreign exchange management with a huge amount of foreign currency earned from usual business, failing to report the purchases to the bank designated by the government, and separately deposited it in the London branch of Chartered Bank, totaling £6,947 9 shillings and 8 pence; the Bombay branch of Chartered Bank, 202 rupees, 14 annas, and 5 pies; the Bombay branch of the Central Bank of China, 5 rupees, 9 annas, and 2 pies; and the Hong Kong branch of Chartered Bank, HK$33,487.88 and 5,970 rupees, plus HK$11.34. They then withdrew the full amount on October 31, 1947, and collected the Hong Kong branch's accounts of Sanwei Company in December of the same year. There are no legal proofs of how the company's remaining HK$30,000 was paid out from February 1 to 15, 1948. Huang Yuanjue also opened a current deposit account in the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of Shanghai under the name of Huang Ansheng. On February 29, 1948, the balance was HK$23,213.86, and HK$703 was paid out with check number (11.315). As of April 30 of the same year, the balance was HK$22,550.86, and the receipt and payment were not handled in accordance with the regulations on foreign exchange management. Afterwards, Chu Shunwei fled with the relevant important account books to avoid review.</p>
<p>Dazhonghua</p>
<p>(C) Dazhonghua Film Enterprise Co., Ltd.: Jiang Boying is the general manager of the company, and Zhang Yansheng is the manager, responsible for accounting. The head office is located in the Central Building on Central Road in Shanghai, and there are offices in Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. According to regulations, foreign exchange is not provided for the import of films, but they remitted funds privately. From May to December 1947, the total amount of funds remitted from Chongqing to Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong was 2,008,200,000 national currency. From April 1947 to March 1948, the amount of "application for foreign exchange" reached 7,718,765,132.95 legal currency, equivalent to HK$324,202.51. The company concealed the head office's account books for the entire year of 1947 in the hope of avoiding investigation.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Lin-Wang, Sanwei, and Dazhonghua commercial firms and companies, buying and selling gold and speculating in foreign exchange, were detected by the Oriental Economic Research Institute, which sent personnel to infiltrate the Lin-Wang Commercial Firm for investigation and conducted a trial gold trading transaction with Ke Hai. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau sent teams to Lin-Wang Commercial Firm and Room 611 of the Hua Ma Hotel, where they seized black market account books, telegrams, checks, receipts, various imported goods, and a pistol. In Sanwei and Dazhonghua companies, many account books related to foreign exchange business were seized. The relevant responsible persons Wang Chunzhe, Zheng Ligong, and Huang Yuanjue, along with the suspect Zhou Zhendong, were reported to the National Government and ordered to be sent to this court for investigation. Zheng Jiayu and others fled upon hearing the news. Lin Tongshi and Zhang Yansheng were successively summoned by this court.</p>
<p>Relevant Legal Provisions:</p>
<p>In summary, except for Zhou Zhendong, whose crime is insufficient, the defendants Wang Chunzhe, Lin Tongshi, Zheng Ligong, Zheng Jiayu, Chen Yanquan, Lin Mingjian, Zheng Tingjiao, Zheng Xianting, and Ke Hai, with a common overarching intention, continuously and jointly bought and sold gold and foreign currency and operated foreign exchange business. In accordance with Article 6 and Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion, Article 4, Paragraph 3, Article 16, and Article 17 of the National General Mobilization Law, they should be punished in accordance with Article 11 and Article 56 of the Criminal Law, Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 1 of the Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency, and Article 33 of the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Huang Yuanjue and Chu Shunwei jointly operated illegal foreign exchange business. In accordance with Article 6 and Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion and Article 17 of the National General Mobilization Law, they should be punished in accordance with Article 11 and Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 56 of the Criminal Law, and Article 33 of the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Zhang Yansheng and Jiang Boying jointly operated illegal foreign exchange. In accordance with Article 6 and Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion and Article 16 and Article 17 of the National General Mobilization Law, they should be punished in accordance with Article 11 and Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 33 of the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Combined with Article 9 and Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Crimes Endangering the State During the Period of Rebellion and Article 2 of the Special Criminal Court Trial Regulations and Article 230, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they are being prosecuted.</p>

<h3>Hu Mengrou, Chief of the Materials Section of the China Textile Northeast Branch, and Others Interrogated in Peiping for Embezzling 80 Billion; Jin Gongyu Prosecuted in the Same Case</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 5th] A huge corruption case involving 80 billion current circulating banknotes has occurred at the Northeast Branch of the China Textile Company. The main culprits are Hu Mengrou, Chief of the Materials Section of the company, and clerk Jin Gongyu. They were arrested in Peiping in May after fleeing and are currently being tried in the Peiping Special Criminal Court. A verdict has not yet been reached. The criminals took advantage of the opportunity to purchase coal at official prices, engaging in fraud for a year. According to investigations, they embezzled over 43 million in cash, inflated coal purchases by 3,000 tons, and stole and sold 1,700 tons of coal, totaling 80 billion.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Retries Wang Wuquan, a Traitor</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] Wang Wuquan, the great traitor of Hangzhou during the enemy puppet regime, was initially sentenced to death after being tried by the court.

Wang made all sorts of sophistry in an attempt to escape punishment, but the public opinion circles demanded that he not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>Yunnanese Smugglers Illegally Transport Tungsten and Tin into Burma</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 5th] Yunnanese merchants smuggling tungsten and tin into Burma is becoming increasingly rampant. According to a report from the Wan-ting warehouse of the Foreign Affairs Office of the National Resources Commission: Tusi (chieftains) from Longling, Mangshi, and Zhefang have indeed seized tungsten and tin that was hidden. Tin can be easily smuggled and sold in Burma at any time, while many people do not recognize tungsten. More than ten tons of tungsten, previously stored by the commission 13 kilometers from Wanting, had been scattered for more than a year. It was not until it was handed over in August 1946 that it was stolen by the Yi people of Longdao. It is estimated that there are approximately 30 tons of tungsten hidden in Mangshi and in the Longling warehouse. There is more private tin in the Jiazhong area of Zhefang Longdao, and most of it is hidden on the Burmese side of the river across from Jiazhong, which is 17 kilometers from Wanting. Tin transported privately from Longling is mostly transported north along the Longling Highway and enters Burma from Longzhou Bamo. Tin from Zhefang is transported along Longdao by bamboo raft downstream, and Moxai has become a gathering place for tungsten and tin smugglers. It is said that each piece of tin can be sold for 120 shields from Yunnan to Burma, and each ton of tungsten is worth about 800 shields. It is also reported that the office stationed in Kunming dispatched Fan Maoxian to western Yunnan to supervise and urge the purchase of tin because tungsten merchant Zhang Qingaog was unable to deliver the tin as agreed. Zhang then purchased the tin from Longdao. It is confirmed that the central government has ordered the Yunnan Police Headquarters to instruct the transportation security authorities to conduct strict inspections at the Yunnan-Burma border.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>Questions Regarding Supreme Court Civil Litigation Judgments</h3>
<p>Asked by Gao Liwu (1) Is there any legal provision regarding the length of time for the Supreme Court to issue a civil litigation judgment? (2) If a Supreme Court case has not been judged for a long time, if an application is made to the Ministry of Judicial Administration or the Control Yuan for remedy, will the "Ministry" or "Yuan" accept it, or is there another Supreme Court-affiliated ministry or yuan that can be appealed to by the party concerned, or a lawsuit filed with the Supreme Court? (3) If the judicial filing procedures are cumbersome, do people need to submit petitions to the "Ministry" or "Yuan" through local administrative or judicial institutions? (4) The Jiangsu Higher Court's judgment in the thirty-fifth year on the debt repayment rate, the other party has not yet fulfilled it. Now that the ratio has changed, can an application be made to change the precedent? Is the application institution still the Higher Court or can the local court also do it?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) There are indeed no time limits for the Supreme Court to accept and judge third-instance civil litigation. (2) The Supreme Court's civil division accepts third-instance civil litigation cases from all provinces, counties, and cities in the country. The urgency of handling cases depends on the speed of the second instance's case files being sent, that is, the second instance's case files have been sent for a considerable period of time. And it must be assigned to various courts for handling by the chief clerk of the court, and after a considerable period of time, if it has not been judged for a long time, the only thing to do is to submit a statement stating the year and number of the case to urge the Supreme Court. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has no right to intervene, and the Control Yuan does not involve illegal or derelict officials, so it is inconvenient to interfere. (3) There is no need to submit it through a lower court, but directly submit a written petition. (4) Reasons can be added to apply for increased payment.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee will be dissolved by the end of this month; manufacturers will have complete freedom to purchase cotton in the future.</h3>
<p>The order to abolish the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee was personally brought here by Chairman Wang Fengseng yesterday morning when he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. According to Mr. Wang, the committee is currently urging various departments to rush to complete the dissolution process, which will be completed before the end of the month. In the future, merchants and factories will be completely free to handle domestic cotton picking, transporting, purchasing, and selling matters, and will not be subject to any government control. As for exports, such as visa approval, and the use of U.S. cotton for substitute spinning and weaving, the government will formulate another plan and hand it over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to set up an institution to handle it. Mr. Wang also stated that promoting the export of yarn and cloth, earning foreign exchange, and preventing the international market from becoming deserted are urgent matters. The government has long considered this issue. There was a proposal to establish a cotton yarn and cloth import and export company after the dissolution of this committee, the main purpose of which is to do just that. Once it is realized, its administrative management should belong to the government, and business contacts should be carried out through official-business cooperation. However, the Textile Construction Company already has an export agency attached to it, so it seems that private companies still need to be organized separately.</p>
<p>[Further News] According to the Foreign Clamp Association, because the association is one of the affiliated institutions of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee has been ordered to be dissolved by the end of this month, and the association will also be dissolved accordingly. However, the current problem is the U.S. aid cotton. It was previously agreed that the Yarn Management Committee and the Foreign Sales Committee would each take charge of it. The Yarn Management Committee uses it to allocate to various manufacturers, and the Foreign Sales Committee uses it to produce yarn and cloth for export. This plan has also been approved by the U.S. Aid Committee. Now, it is reported that the first batch of emergency allocation of U.S. cotton, worth 13.7 million U.S. dollars, has been approved by the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and can be used. The warehouse receipt can be taken out for customs declaration within days, and it is expected that the goods can be picked up within ten days. Therefore, the establishment of a new institution is a matter of great urgency.</p>
<h3>Abnormally Loose Monetary Conditions, Shanghai Stock Market Fluctuates and Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Shanghai stocks repeatedly tried to rally yesterday, but buying interest could not be fully realized due to concerns about the new economic plan. The process was mediocre and mostly sideways, and ended in a slight show of strength due to unprecedentedly loose monetary conditions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the market opened high due to the indecision of the economic countermeasures and many rumors of helping securities purchases. Yong Yarn opened at 12,250 yuan, and No. 89, No. 183, No. 154, No. 218, No. 11, and No. 65 advanced to 12,550 yuan. No. 179, No. 99, No. 55, No. 153, No. 205, No. 216, No. 30, No. 102, and No. 185 were sold, and the price retreated to 12,300 yuan. Although No. 213, No. 98, No. 143, No. 187, and No. 206 advanced, the selling interest of No. 3, No. 83, No. 65, No. 185, and No. 89 was still strong, and the price retreated to 12,270 yuan. Yarn and cloth rebounded, and No. 89, No. 126, No. 76, No. 13, No. 206, No. 163, No. 156, No. 76, and No. 145 advanced to 12,600 yuan. No. 222, No. 154, No. 56, No. 116, No. 148, No. 135, No. 213, No. 61, and No. 207 were all sold, but the price still could not be supported, and the midday close fell to 12,330 yuan. Except for Lianhua's limit up, China-France Xinhua Match, Tongyi, and Xinyi remained flat, and Huafeng and China Silk slightly declined, the rest all rose slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn opened at 12,700 yuan. No. 76, No. 205, and No. 54 first sold to 12,580 yuan. No. 134, No. 145, No. 85, No. 95, No. 89, No. 104, No. 169, and No. 176 advanced to 12,830 yuan. No. 180, No. 152, No. 12, No. 99, No. 169, No. 89, and No. 95 closed out, and the price fell back to 12,680 yuan. There were very strong calls in the market for suspending the afternoon market, and trading was virtually interrupted for a long time. No. 137, No. 190, No. 143, and No. 72 absorbed the selling pressure and rose to 12,820 yuan. No. 169, No. 179, and No. 145 closed out, and the market closed at 12,750 yuan. Xinguang worked hard to rally on its own, and the situation was quite good. Compared with the morning close, in addition to Liandi and Yongye's limit up, Tongyi and China Silk Zhabei rose by half, Hengfeng remained flat, and the rest all rose slightly. In the over-the-counter market, Huashang, Dasheng, Huacheng, and Zhonghua saw a good performance, each rising by half, while the rest were only stable.</p>
<p>Government bonds showed fatigue again yesterday. Unified bonds opened at 1.22 million in the morning, then fell to 1.03 million, and then closed at 1.18 million. Room 500 bought in, while Room 550 and Chengde sold out. Room 360 bought in first and then sold out, while Room 552 sold out first and then bought in. Compared with the previous close, A, B, and D bonds were 60,000 yuan lower, C bonds fell 70,000 yuan, and E bonds fell 40,000 yuan. The turnover was 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Alleviate the Panic of Cash Shortage 5 Million Yuan Banknotes to be Issued</h3>
<p>Central Bank Authority Tells Banks and Money Shops that they will be officially issued around the 10th.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the issuance of large banknotes, the only ones circulating in the market so far are 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000 gold standard notes. However, the number of 25,000 and 50,000 yuan notes issued is very small, resulting in a shortage of cash in the market. In the past few days, due to the increase in funds flowing into Shanghai from various places, the panic has increased. Currently, the cash premium has reached 80 million yuan for every 1 billion yuan. The National Bank's cash allocation quota for each major bank is 20 billion yuan, making it impossible to circulate. Most banks issue bank drafts to pay customers, so the number of bank drafts issued by various banks has been quite large in recent days. Some large stores have also begun to accept bank drafts from major banks as usual. According to reporters' investigation, the National Bank is paying close attention to the cash shortage and is doing its best to find a solution, and is rushing to print various large banknotes. The 250,000 yuan face value gold standard, which was originally scheduled to be issued at the end of the month, is also being rushed to print. It is said that it can be officially issued around the 10th, and Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the National Bank, has officially stated to the banks and money shops that the cash shortage can be resolved after the 10th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] A phenomenon of cash shortage has occurred in the market these days, and the banking and money industry has held a special meeting to resolve the difficulty. According to the Central Bank, the National Bank is doing its best to solve the problem of cash withdrawal for banks, and has never restricted it, but the cash is relatively small and insufficient for allocation. Moreover, the current face value of currency is obviously too small compared with the price, and the amount of various payments has increased sharply with the changes in prices. This is the real reason for the cash shortage. Once the 5 million yuan banknote is issued, this problem can be solved.</p>
<h3>Extremely Loose Monetary Conditions, Banks Showed Large Deficits Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's monetary conditions were loose, but cash was still in short supply. In the check exchange of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury, there was an unprecedentedly huge deficit due to the payment of foreign exchange settlement and remittances from various places, totaling 47.92 billion. Among them, the Central Bank's deficit of 20.991 billion was the largest. The Bank of China's deficit was 11.377 billion, the Bank of Communications' deficit was 14.734 billion, the Farmers Bank's deficit was 2.936 billion, and the China Trust Bureau's surplus was 2.998 billion. The Postal Remittance Bureau's deficit was 133 million, and the Central Cooperative Treasury's deficit was 747 million. The commercial banks' large exchange had a surplus of 10.351 billion, the small exchange had a surplus of 5.768 billion, and the foreign banks had a total surplus of 31.801 billion.</p>
<h3>The Market Price of Exchange Settlement Certificates Rose Again, Close to the Black Market Rate of U.S. Exchange</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The market price of foreign exchange settlement certificates has risen sharply in recent days, reaching 6 million yesterday, close to the black market rate of U.S. exchange. As a result, the export industry has also become more active. Taking tung oil as an example, the New York market price converted to 140 million yuan per dan, while the internal price is 130 million yuan per dan. The New York market price of hog bristles converted to national currency is 2.3 billion per sima dan, and the domestic price is 1.8 billion per zu dong, which is still profitable. Therefore, the transaction of export materials has become more active in recent days. It is said that the rise in the price of exchange settlement certificates is mainly because the Export Management Committee has recently issued a large number of import licenses for various oils, and the need for conversion has increased, so the market has also improved. People in the import and export industry estimate that if the distance between the market price of exchange settlement certificates and the black market rate of U.S. exchange can be kept below 20%, there will be no problem with exports, and the phenomenon of export smuggling can also be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Public Sentiment Turned Strong, Sales Became Active, Rice Prices Rose Consistently, White Rice Exceeded the 40 Million Yuan Mark Again</h3>
<p>Rice prices rebounded, monetary conditions remained loose, and the huge price increases of public utilities turned the depressed public sentiment into strength. Rice shops saw frequent purchases at low prices, and sales became active. The market rose after opening, and the Nanshi market rose by 1.5 million to 3 million, with white rice exceeding 40 million again. Indica rice and glutinous rice rose by 2 million uniformly. The Beishi market rose less, with japonica and indica rising by 1 million each, and premium japonica remaining flat. Yesterday's arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 2,752 shih.</p>
<p>The price increase of public utilities increased the cost of flour, and the transportation cost also increased. The loose monetary conditions increased the appetite of retail investors. Old car flour rose from 13.2 million to 13.75 million, and there were more transactions of military vessel flour, closing at 13.25 million. The former rose by 500,000, and the latter rose by 750,000. Miscellaneous brand flour rose by 300,000 to 400,000 uniformly, and large bags of wheat bran rose by 500,000.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains showed a unified upward trend. Monetary conditions were extremely loose, customer appetite increased, and due to reasons such as increased transportation costs, soybeans rose by 1 million, and corn and yuan wheat rose by 1 million to 2 million each under the acquisition of the northern gang. The arrival of broad beans was not much, and the price increased by 1 million. Green beans were actively sold and rose by 2 million to 3 million. There was more disposal of sesame seeds on this street, and the price also increased by 2 million to 3 million. A small number of shelled peanuts were traded, with Xuzhou shelled peanuts at 65 million.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices rose due to very loose monetary conditions, retail investors bought more on dips, and the rising prices of raw material soybeans and public utilities increased costs. Most factories opened for sale of soybean oil at 87 million, and the closing price rose to 90 million for returned goods. Vegetable oil closed at 83 million, with each rising by 7 million to 8 million. Raw oil rose by 10 million, and a barrel of raw oil was 117 million. The market for bean cake, which was absorbed by retail investors, turned upward, rising by 600,000 to 700,000.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market showed even greater potential, with prices rising across the board. The factors contributing to this rise include: (1) relaxed monetary policy and an oversupply of money, leading to a general increase in commodity prices; (2) increased costs for public utilities and shipping; (3) export settlement certificates initially reaching 6.2 million, and although later falling slightly below that, market confidence remains strong. Therefore, there is hope for further price increases in the future.</p>
<p>It is also reported that to assist exports and secure more foreign exchange, the authorities, through the Four Joint Banks, are offering mortgage loans for exported tea. Initially, the loan amount was set at 10 million 法幣 per dan (a unit of weight), but due to currency value fluctuations, this amount is no longer practically sufficient. Recently, Tang, the chairman of the Tea Exporters Association of this city, and others met with Yu Hongjun, the governor of the Central Bank, to express their concerns. Yu expressed sympathy and promised to discuss the matter at a meeting early next week.</p>
<h3>Increase in Returned Checks</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The number of returned checks at Taishi banks was higher on Monday (the 2nd), totaling 4,041, exceeding the previous week's high of 3,789 by 252. The total amount of the returned checks was 883.3 billion, exceeding the previous week's high of 662.73992 billion by 200.58008 billion. On Tuesday, both the number and total amount of returned checks decreased, but the total amount was still higher than the previous week, with 2,828 returned checks totaling 741.1 billion. On Wednesday, 2,503 returned checks totaled 836.6 billion.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Timber Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Philippine vessel "Northwest," managed by Wah Lun &amp; Co., arrived in Shanghai on the 4th with over 1.5 million feet of timber. It is currently berthed at buoys 33 and 34 for unloading. Additionally, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hailu" vessel returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou yesterday, carrying over 16,000 pieces of timber, and is currently berthed at buoys 3 and 4 for unloading.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw the Cotton Yarn Control Committee continue to release four types of yarn, but prices generally increased by over 100 million, boosting market confidence at the opening. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped 110 million immediately upon opening for tomorrow's delivery. Current delivery prices were also good, rising by 50 to 60 million. There was a slight pullback in the middle of the day. Recently, buyers from Tianjin and Guangdong continued to purchase actively, and local traders were also keen, causing sellers to hold firm on prices. The final price for current delivery was 2.005 billion, and tomorrow's delivery was 2.1 billion, up 50 to 60 million from the previous day. Prices for other coarse and fine yarns also generally increased by 70 to 80 million, 110 to 120 million, and 230 to 240 million, respectively. Only 43 lots were traded.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with uncertainty due to rumors of a new economic policy being announced next week, causing prices to fluctuate. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened strong, with prices jumping 4.3 million due to occasional purchases. Later, some sellers took profits on the higher prices from the previous day, causing prices to fall by 700,000 to 800,000 around 10 a.m. At that time, there was little downward pressure, but due to the Central Bank's large-scale lending and easier monetary policy, buyers from Tianjin and Hankou were actively replenishing their stocks. In addition, public utility costs had increased sharply, raising factory costs, and it was rumored that the Spinning &amp; Weaving Company was only producing Dragon Head B-grade fine cloth and 3A 彩球细布. Market sentiment was revived, and confidence was exceptionally strong. Dragon Head fine cloth closed at 59.2 million, up 5.7 million from the previous day. After the market closed, prices rose further to 9.35 million with buyers accepting that price. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, and 哔叽 cloth also rose by 1 to 2 million to 4 to 5.7 million, with 1,600 bolts traded.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Exchange Control Measures Affect Yarn and Cloth Exports</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Special Report] Since the revised export certificate measures were implemented, all exported goods, except those shipped to China and the Sterling Area, must be exchanged with the government. The first to be affected by this measure are Siam and Vietnam. According to these exchange control measures, it is equivalent to a linked system. All goods exported to these two regions must be accounted for with the Financial Secretary, and at the same time, goods must be imported from Siam to Hong Kong, and both parties must offset their accounts to pay for the goods. In other words, those who ship goods to Siam must ship goods back from Siam to Hong Kong to offset the cost. Cotton yarn and cloth merchants were the first to be affected by this measure. Most Siamese firms are not yet clear on the exchange control measures, so many have temporarily stopped taking in goods. As a result, the cotton yarn market has been quiet, and even the once-popular 40-count single yarn has been affected. In the cloth market,扣布, 白布, and 甲黑布, which are mostly sold to Siam, have also been slightly affected due to the aforementioned reasons. It is reported that recent purchasing interest from the Dutch East Indies has been slow. Hong Kong's cotton yarn relies on exports to the Dutch East Indies and Siam, and with neither region purchasing, the market is bound to fall. As for the cloth market, it is still supported by Singapore, so the fall is less significant. According to related sources, Siamese firms that usually purchase cotton yarn and cloth are mostly acting as agents and rarely ship goods from Siam to Hong Kong. These firms will be significantly affected by this measure.</p>
<h3>Bank of Taiwan Announces June Issuance Amount</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Taipei, 5th] The Bank of Taiwan recently announced that the total issuance amount for June was 35 billion, of which 70% was for agricultural, industrial, mining, and water conservancy projects.</p>
<h3>The Import Control Committee Corrects Fuel Import Quantities</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Import Control Committee recently issued a message correcting the diesel import figures it released for the period from July 1, last year, to June 30 this year. The corrected figures are as follows:</p>
<h3>Quota Import Quantities</h3>
<p>Light diesel: 76,543.913 tons</p>
<p>Medium diesel: 195,230.196 tons</p>
<p>Heavy diesel: 26,776.308 tons</p>
<p>Fuel oil: 640,655.385 tons</p>
<p>Extra-Quota Import Quantities</p>
<p>Light diesel: 74,265.729 tons</p>
<p>Medium diesel: 68,705.866 tons</p>
<p>Fuel oil: 33,804.101 tons</p>
<p>In total, diesel imports for the past year amounted to 441,522.013 tons, and fuel oil imports amounted to 774,459.486 tons.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Reeling Loan</h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang reach over 750 billion</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoon reeling loan, started by the Farmers Bank of China, has reached 76 manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with a loan amount of over 750 billion. Jiangsu accounts for over 550 billion, and the rest is from Zhejiang. According to the regulations, there are 86 qualified loan factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year, including 5 in Shanghai and Suzhou, 50 in Wuxi, and the rest are in various parts of Zhejiang. It is also stipulated that loans will only be given to manufacturers who can prove that they have started production after the cocoon collection loan is completed. The loan amount per reeling machine, after deducting a waste fee of 135 million, is provisionally set at 440.4 million in Shanghai, 440 million in Suzhou and Wuxi, 390 million in Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou, and 373 million in Sheng County. It is also reported that the amount of raw silk reeled by various factories and submitted to the Farmers Bank of China has reached over 1,000 bales as of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Deposit Reserve Interest Rate Changed to 1.5 Jiao Per Month</h3>
<p>[Report] It was recently learned from the National Bank that the interest rate on deposit reserves paid by commercial banks to the National Bank has been increased from 1.2 Jiao per month to 1.5 Jiao per month starting in August.</p>
<h3>Tin and Antimony Sales in Hong Kong are Active</h3>
<p>This year, the sales of both tin and antimony in Hong Kong have been very active. Except for antimony, which is managed by the Resources Commission, both official and private merchants ship pure tin to Hong Kong. At the same time, they are directly shipped from Yunnan and Guangxi production areas to Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong. Merchants from Nanyang, Calcutta, and India also come to purchase. The actual sales in Hong Kong itself were originally very scarce, but in recent years, with the relocation of Chinese factories to Hong Kong, the actual sales have increased compared to before. Currently, the price of pure tin in the Shanghai market is 12 billion per ton for transactions among peers, and 11.5 billion for large quantities. The price of antimony is 3.2 billion per ton. It is also reported that the imports from Hong Kong to Shanghai are mainly brass angles and 92% red copper. The former sells for 100 Hong Kong dollars per dan, and the latter sells for 74 Hong Kong dollars per dan. The fall in these market prices is mainly due to fluctuations in the Hong Kong exchange rate.</p>

<h3>Important Match in Basketball Tournament: Our Team Loses to the Philippines, Weakening Hopes of Reaching the Final Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th] Our basketball team participating in the Olympics lost to the Philippines last night at the Harringay Arena with a score of 51 to 32. This was an important match in this group, and the loss significantly diminishes their chances. Although our team fought hard throughout the 40 minutes, they struggled to cope with the Philippines' agility. They could not take the initiative against such a strong opponent. In the preliminary round, our team adopted a defensive strategy, which prevented the Philippines from succeeding. Bao Songyuan scored eight points at this time and worked hard to stop the enemy team from attacking. After a 15-minute tug-of-war, the Philippines suddenly became active and took a 13-point lead in the first half. In the second half, the Philippines' teamwork became tighter, their shooting became more accurate, and their momentum increased. Our forwards could not penetrate the enemy's defense, and except for Bao Songyuan, the performances of the other players were not as good as usual. Our team made several substitutions, but they did not help. With this loss, our team's hopes of reaching the finals are slim. Because in the second group (our team belongs to this group), the two leading teams, Chile and the Philippines, have only lost one match each. Only if these two teams fail again can the points of the Chinese and Korean teams be equal to the points of the Chilean and Philippine teams. According to the Olympics basketball competition rules, if the points are equal, the ranking will be determined by the scoring average. The team with the higher score comes first. So far, our team has scored 155 points, the Philippines has scored 227 points, Chile has scored 248 points, and Korea has scored 230 points (the negative scores of each team have been deducted). If the points are equal, our team will need to score about 150 points in the match against the Iraqi team, while the other three teams will give Iraq over 100 points.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] In today's Olympic basketball match between China and the Philippines, the Chinese team was unfortunately defeated by a score of 32 to 51 due to physical fatigue. Although the Chinese basketball team lost to the Philippines today, the skills of the Chinese players, especially Cai Wenhua and Li Zhenzhong, still won the applause of the audience. The speed of both sides was so fast that the referees also had difficulty keeping up.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Harringay, 4th] In the second group of the basketball tournament, the "rapidly rising" Chinese team could not create another miracle on the evening of the 4th and bowed to the Philippines with a score of 51 to 32.

<h3>Our Team Wins Against Korea in the Olympic Basketball Tournament; A Scene of Jubilation</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 5th] It is generally believed here that, apart from last night's game between China and Korea, no other basketball preliminary games have produced surprising results. The Chinese basketball team's excellent sportsmanship was the key to their victory with a score of 49 to 48. In the first half, Korea led with a score of 28 to 16. Although the Chinese team tried their best to counterattack in the second half, it was until the end of the third quarter. Most of the overseas Chinese spectators thought there was little chance of victory, especially since the Korean team was still in the lead before the end of the game. However, in the last five minutes, the Chinese team desperately "boosted" their morale. Li Shiqiao, number eight, made some admirable long shots. His success deeply moved the other team members, so they scored as many as sixteen points in five minutes. In the last minute, the Chinese team had a free throw opportunity, but it did not go into the net and was snatched by the Korean team, who charged straight to the Chinese side. At this time, Li Shiqiao immediately grabbed the ball, rushed to the enemy line, and with the superb skill of hitting the target from a hundred paces away, threw the ball into the net one second before the end of the game. The British spectators were extremely admiring of Li Shiqiao's ball skills, and his occasional amazing moves often made the audience shout "Shorty" incessantly. Especially in the last few minutes, the sound of cheering was continuous. The Mandarin and Cantonese announcers of the British Broadcasting Corporation also shouted loudly, surprising the technicians in the company's control room. After the game, the Chinese team members lifted Li Shiqiao high, sometimes raising his feet above their heads. The overseas Chinese also gathered at the edge of the iron net to get a glimpse of him.</p>

We must follow what he said, review the past, and encourage the future. Here, I temporarily set a few of the most basic and easiest to implement points as follows: (1) Students in the school dormitory may not allow outsiders to stay unless specially approved. (2) After the school has designated the addresses of boarding students and social organizations, they may not move privately or forcibly occupy houses.

<h3>Idle Talk About the American Election</h3>
<p>— Green Man</p>
<p>The editor of Life magazine is a sarcastic person. He used most of a page to publish a photo of Truman giving a campaign speech. The auditorium was very large, but the audience only filled the first few rows. Most of the space in the photo was empty seats. The editor did not let up, and in the caption, he lightly said that Truman's campaign speech produced an unbelievable fact: he still had the courage to be complacent!</p>
<p>In fact, we might as well say that Truman's ability to attract an audience today is not even as good as Wallace. Wallace's speeches required tickets, but they were often packed, with people standing to listen to his speech filling the gaps in the venue.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that Wallace will create any miracles in this election. Although he is eloquent, it should be noted that he has made many enemies, which is the biggest taboo in American election traditions. With Taft's aristocratic reputation and years of careful preparation for the election, he still lost in the Republican National Convention. The main reason was that he was unpopular.</p>
<p>Every American secretly wants to be president, but those few who are actively campaigning are truly pervasive and extremely hardworking. According to the U.S. Constitution, a U.S. President only needs to be over 35 years old, born in the U.S., and have resided in the U.S. for more than 14 years. But the actual conditions are much more demanding: he must be from a "large" state, be white, believe in Protestantism, be a good husband and father in the family, be extremely proper, love farming life, be able to catch a few fish, and have the patience to read a few pages of detective novels in bed.</p>
<p>After meeting these conditions, he must also be able to campaign seriously. Campaigning is not easy. "There is no shortcut to the White House." A candidate must start planning everything patiently several years in advance. He must know the art of bargaining and have real "drive."</p>
<p>Planning everything behind the presidential candidate is his "campaign manager." This person must have extremely high organizational skills, be a propaganda genius, and be able to make everyone feel that they have gained the upper hand even when suffering a defeat. The most important thing is: he must pay close attention to the likes and dislikes of voters, then seize the "opportunity" and prescribe the right medicine to ensure that every move of the candidate can win the favor of the public.</p>
<p>When a candidate sets out to campaign, his entire course of action must be planned in detail in advance. The campaign manager first sends people out to prepare, and when the candidate arrives, the campaign workers tell him what things are particularly important in this place and how he should speak. When he gives a speech, the campaign workers have already been scattered in the audience, and as soon as he finishes speaking, they will ask one or two questions to praise him, and sometimes take the lead in applauding to arouse everyone's agreement.</p>
<p>Of course, the candidate himself also understands the trick of "saying the right things to the right people," and contradictions are inevitable. Stetson suffered this loss in this campaign. His enemies collected his speech records and deliberately broadcast two contradictory ones on the radio at the same time, putting Stetson in an awkward position.</p>
<p>When Dewey was giving a speech in Nebraska, a dog suddenly came onto the stage. According to the United Press, Dewey then ordered the dog to be driven out. This made Dewey's campaign manager anxious - wouldn't countless men and women who love dogs in the United States become disgusted with Dewey? So he hurriedly asked for a correction. They said that what Dewey said after seeing the dog was: "Hey, you came to be with us too, didn't you? - It's just like the hunting dog I had in my hometown of Owosso, Michigan, when I was a child."</p>
<p>In addition, Dewey's refusal to wear the Indian headdress full of feathers also made his campaign manager quite uneasy. He was worried that he would lose some Native American votes because of this.</p>
<p>When Taft was campaigning in Texas, he went to watch a ball game to show his love for sports. The game was wonderful, but Taft fell asleep on the platform in full view of everyone! This one wrong move must have cost him many votes.</p>
<p>A U.S. President also needs a condition - Dewey passed, and he won the initial victory; Martin, Taft, Stetson, and MacArthur failed, and they failed.</p>
<p>What condition?</p>
<p>First, wireless image transmission is now very common; second, everyone is vying for America's considerable number of female voters - therefore, presidential candidates must be quite handsome!</p>
<p>Martin, the Speaker of the House who failed in the Republican nomination, touched his chin and said, "I don't know why, my beard always looks like it hasn't been shaved for a few weeks." And this may be one of the reasons for his defeat.</p>
<h3>Remembering Rao Hanxiang</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, the literary world was full of talented people, and Rao Hanxiang can be said to be the first among them who rose to prominence from humble beginnings. Hanxiang's courtesy name was Bisheng, or Misheng, and he was from Hubei. He was a successful candidate in the late Qing Dynasty Guimao imperial examination. In his early years, he studied with Fan Fanshan, and his poetry and prose were grand and beautiful, and his calligraphy was exquisite. His teacher admired him deeply. He was especially familiar with the Book of Han, and he held a volume in his hand all day long, reciting it with self-satisfaction. If someone questioned him with doubts, he would answer fluently. He, Feng Junmu, who specialized in Records of the Grand Historian, and Zhang Taiyan Guangsheng, who was proficient in the Book of Han, could be regarded as a tripod standing on three legs.</p>
<p>Rao had an unusual appearance. He spoke quickly, spitting everywhere, and the dishes were a mess. He liked to pour the remaining soup into the soup bowl. He was initially a waiting-for-appointment salt commissioner in Fujian and a member of the General Affairs Section of the Education Affairs Office. His colleagues all hated his messiness and regarded eating with him as a misery, so he was lonely and felt depressed. At that time, Yao Wenzhuo, the education commissioner, was a scholar with extensive learning. He knew that he was different from the crowd and treated him with some respect. However, most of his subordinates were virtuous scholars from all over the world, such as Chen Baochen and Jiang Chunlin, who were all chairmen of committees appointed by one hand. Although he was elegant, it was difficult for him to win favor alone. In his residence, he was always unable to stretch himself, so he angrily sought to leave.</p>
<p>After returning to Hubei, he was poorly dressed and bored. He had the opportunity to meet Li Yuanhong, and Yuanhong immediately became friends with him, praising him as the Jiang Lang of the day and entrusting him with the important task of [illegible character] chamber. When he became president, he promoted Hanxiang to secretary-general, succeeding Tang Hualong. During this period, Li sent several telegrams, and the writing was excellent, and it is still widely praised today. It is said that they were all written by Hanxiang. According to what I know, this is mostly untrue. When he was in the old capital, he once said to my father: "The first few telegrams were actually drafts by my teacher Fan Fanshan. He is old and does not want to show his name, but because Hanxiang is his student, he is willing to do it for him. The world does not understand the source of this matter, so the facts are contrary to reality." My father was once the section chief of the Education Affairs Office and was very familiar with Hanxiang, treating him with great respect. Hanxiang also regarded him as a confidant, so he revealed all the secrets without hiding anything.</p>
<p>I remember that after he became a high official, he visited my father many times at his residence in the old capital, expressing his heartfelt sincerity. My father had given up his career and had no expectations, so after returning the visit, he returned to Shanghai. Before long, Hanxiang sent a letter again, saying that he had missed the opportunity to welcome him before and was disappointed that he had already returned south. The letter was not reproachful, showing his old friendship, and so on. It can be seen from this that he had no official airs at all. Those in the world who like to change their attitude with their position, can they not be ashamed when they see this? Later, he joined Guo Songling, a great general outside the customs. When Songling was defeated, Hanxiang also died in depression, leaving a daughter but no son. Is this what is meant by the waxing and waning, and the mixture of good and bad fortune?</p>
<h3>Linking Talk</h3>
<p>— Ren Yi</p>
<p>Some couplets use repeated characters. In a previous issue, Mr. Jianqiu's "Miscellaneous Talk on Couplets" mentioned the "Pinghu Autumn Moon" couplet in West Lake, which is indeed excellent. There is another couplet in West Lake, with one character repeated, which is even more wonderful. The couplet says: "Green, green, red, red, everywhere orioles and swallows; wind, wind, rain, rain, year after year, dawn after dusk." Only ten characters, but it captures all the scenery of West Lake.</p>
<p>I occasionally looked through old papers and found a few old magazines. With nothing to do in the long summer, I used them for entertainment. I saw a clever antithetical couplet that said: "The moon in the sky is full, the moon on earth is half, every month the full moon meets the half. Today is the end of the year, tomorrow is the beginning of the year, year after year the end of the year connects the beginning of the year."</p>
<p>About a mile outside the south gate of my hometown, Yixing, there is a long embankment across the Jingxi River. It is said that General Yue Wu Mu of the Song Dynasty built it to pursue the Jin soldiers, so it is named "Yue Embankment." There is a small pavilion on the side of the embankment, surrounded by water on three sides, with excellent scenery. Some Yixing people have written couplets to commemorate the scenic spot. Zhou Zuyuan's couplet: "The caring water moon makes you suspect there is no road; leisurely talk about the spring waves at the Curved Water Pavilion." Cheng Zhe'an's couplet: "The small court that crossed south, only the long embankment remains for thousands of years. The old Chan monastery in the east neighborhood, sometimes hears the sound of clear chimes." The east corner of the pavilion is the site of the former Sisui Nunnery. There is a couplet by Chu Jianweng: "Wind and rain all year round are unobstructed; the rivers and mountains for ten thousand years admire this loyalty." During the War of Resistance, the Yue Pavilion was destroyed by artillery fire, and the couplets in the pavilion have become a lost melody of Guangling, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>There is a couplet for a God of Wealth temple, where each character comes from "　", which is quite unique. The couplet says: "Far and near, the Tao reaches for carefree passage; advancing and retreating, the connection returns when fortune is met."</p>
<h3>Remembering A Yi</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>The child's writing is not yet finished, his fingers are suddenly black, the small ball is not to be seen, his loud voice is filled with tears, wipe away the tears, and the double circles of ink are revealed.</p>
<p>He loves fatty meat when eating vegetables, and he is quite foolish when there is nothing to do. Scissors are always in his hand, and shredded paper suddenly fills the room. He does not walk well, he has songs when he opens his mouth, sometimes he pulls grandpa's nose, sometimes he covers grandpa's eyes, he wants grandpa to breathe quickly, he wants grandpa not to read.</p>
<p>Going out to learn to dress up, he is especially happy in front of the mirror, dabbing rouge red on his forehead, and applying fragrant powder white to his hair. Suddenly he makes a funny face, laughs at himself and cherishes himself.</p>
<p>The sound of books is temporarily stopped, he tilts his head and sleeps soundly, he suddenly wakes up again when he gets into bed, his hands and feet are quite stiff, the nanny tells stories, he asks his mother for food and drink, he takes out peanuts from his bag, and peanuts fill the bed.</p>
<h3>Random Musings from Ziluoban'an</h3>
<p>— Shoujuan</p>
<p>The late great Polish musician, Mr. Paderewski, was known throughout the world as a virtuoso pianist. During the First World War in Europe, he no longer associated with the keys. When asked why, he said with emotion, "In these times of such chaos and unrest, how can I have the heart to continue with music!" I, too, feel similarly this year. I secretly wish to burn my inkstone like Jun Miao, no longer to be a slave to writing. However, when my heart is touched, I cannot help but speak, for the pain of mourning my late wife has yet to be relieved. Counting from the passing of my late wife, Feng Jun, it has already been over two years. Wars rage on, and life becomes increasingly difficult. Even if she were still alive, she would be worried and withered to death. It would be better if she had never seen this at all. In these two years, besides treasuring her daily belongings, I have also sought out plants and animals associated with the phoenix, placing them in the Fenglaiyi room, so that seeing these objects may ease the pain of longing. My close friends, Zhao Ziyun, Cai Zhenyuan, and Zhang Qixian, have each gifted me with fine varieties of balsam, including the White Crane Top, Red Crane Top, Purple Crane Top, Pink Crane Top, and speckled and powdered gold varieties. Brother Fan Ziming has also gifted me with phoenix-tail bamboo and large phoenix monthly roses, their sincere intentions deeply appreciated! It is a pity that a sage has not appeared in this world, for I deeply regret not being able to acquire a real phoenix. My literary friend, Brother Wu Jiren, once gave me two phoenix chicks last year, cherishing them like precious jewels. Who knew that after only a few months, they would break out of their cage and fly away. In regret, I wrote poems to express my sorrow. The white copper round cage where they were kept has remained empty to this day, as it is not easy to acquire such birds in Wu. Recently, my old friend, Brother Jiang Baoli, came from Shanghai, bringing a pair of newborn phoenix chicks, saying that Brother Wu Jiren had spent a great deal of money to acquire them as a gift, entrusting him to pass them on. His deep affection is beyond words! Thus, I wrote three quatrains to express my feelings: "Separated by heaven and earth, we are bitterly apart, my mourning for the phoenix is improper in every way; who knows that when the balsam blooms, the carved cage will once again see the Fenglaiyi (When the chicks arrived, the balsam flowers were blooming brightly like brocade)." "Not a fish, yet knowing the fish's joy, heaven blesses the fortunate with youthful happiness (Brother Jiren is fond of raising goldfish, finding endless joy in it). The pair of phoenixes, bestowed from afar, are exceptionally lovely, their graceful bodies and abundant feathers resembling the blue sky (The phoenix feathers are exquisitely beautiful, the color of the blue sky)." "Old grievances of the past are like spring grass, growing day and night, impossible to eradicate; the affectionate bird is capable of comforting me, no need to dream of flying to Lingyan (My late wife is buried in the Xiugu Cemetery of Lingyan)."</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Songli Middle School relies on tuition fees to maintain its operations, so it is inevitable that student fees must be increased from time to time to avoid losses. To seek surplus is also not against human nature. Running and providing education should also consider everyone's livelihood, and is not the same as charity. Frankly speaking, the necessity of increasing tuition fees according to the cost of living index is similar in nature to merchants increasing the price of goods slightly according to market conditions. The anxiety of poor students who are unable to pay tuition fees, however, is similar to the worries of ordinary households who are troubled by high prices and difficult living.</p>
<p>Merchants increase prices at any time, and all goods are expensive, exceeding the purchasing power of most people, resulting in economic depression. Private schools increase their fees, exceeding the ability of most students to pay, resulting in fewer applicants, more dropouts, and deserted gates. In contrast, the summer entrance examinations for national and municipal primary and secondary schools are extremely crowded, with ten times more applicants than positions available. Private schools fear that applicants will not be brave enough to apply, while public schools fear that there will be too many applicants, making it difficult to cope even with strong efforts. The list of those who fail is long, and they cannot help but lament, "Where can we find thousands upon thousands of spacious rooms?" The education of the next generation of citizens is truly unthinkable.</p>
<p>This is only the case in the old capital. And the "difficult births" of the Northeast are also coming with "refugees" in a continuous stream. As a result, vacant rooms inside and outside the nine gates are either temporary schools or refugee shelters. This situation is quite similar to the aftermath of the "September 18th" Incident. However, during the "September 18th" Incident, the Northeast was completely occupied by the enemy, and the people were unwilling to be slaves in puppet cities, fleeing to Pingjin. Now, Changguan is still under the control of the National Army, and the entire area is under the governance of our country. If it is said that the cities of Liaoning and Shenyang are already "isolated islands," then why is the old capital not surrounded by enemies on all sides? Moreover, Shanxi has also moved its schools to Ping, and several batches of Western "difficult births" have arrived by air, indicating that all parties recognize this place as a "land of happiness." However, whether there is actually enough space to provide shelter for all those who come from all directions, or whether it will increase the burden here, can be understood by observing the general situation and records, without the need for lengthy explanations. The more people who come from all directions, the more "floating capital" comes with them. The old saying goes, "When people prosper, wealth prospers," which seems to apply to present-day Beiping. During the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, this place was the capital, with people from all provinces gathering here, and remittances pouring in, making the market prosperous. This was because the money at that time was "money," not "paper." Real money and goods could make industry and commerce flourish, and blood circulation flow smoothly, while "paper" currency and floating capital would only make prices soar and resources become more scarce. In the past, the old capital had five railways extending in all directions, and goods from land and water were all flowing. Now, the old capital has many obstacles to transportation, and scarce resources. Large denominations of paper money must constantly increase their circulation, so the result is the opposite.</p>
<p>The problem of housing for refugees coming to Ping is more manageable than the problem of food, simply because although "things" are not "abundant," "land" is still "large." Some large altars, large courtyards, large temples, such as the Guozijian inside Andingmen, the Baiyunguan outside Xibianmen, and the Temple of Heaven inside Yongdingmen, have all become shelters.</p>
<p>The Guozijian is the ancient "Imperial College," with the most solemn Confucius temple in the country, the lecture halls of the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Doctoral Instructors, and Assistant Instructors, and the classrooms of various students. Its vast and deep courtyards are now occupied by thousands of refugees. In the hot weather, the air is filled with the stench of sweat, and outbreaks of epidemics have already been discovered. The Baiyunguan is the "Fairyland" left behind by Qiu Chuji, the so-called Changchun Zhenren. The temple is very large, with many courtyards and many gods. Its incense was at its peak during the late Qing Dynasty, and its grandeur was unparalleled. Now, it is in a state of desolation. After the arson case of the old Daoist, its appearance has changed even more. Using it as a "shelter" can be considered making use of waste. The Temple of Heaven is where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties performed sacrifices to heaven. Its scale is vast and its architecture is exquisite. It is now used as barracks for some large troops, and the situation inside is indescribable.</p>
