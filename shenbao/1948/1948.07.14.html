<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕立院十三日院會，接受該院敎育文化委會關於譒譯官，公費留學生請願案之審査意見，認爲政府旣有遣送彼等留學之諾言，且經公開考試榜示錄取，自不應遲不撥給外匯，徒耗各生寳貫光陰，有損政府信譽，決議以該會委員名義，向政院提出書面質詢。</p>

<h3 id="c18">辦理農貸的幾個問題 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>自四　總感於三月中旬，決定恢復農貸之後，迄今已逾四月；國內各方對此項工作之推行，均極重觀，咸以爲此一問題，若能處理得當，固有利於國計民生；否則反足以加深農村財富的集中，助長物價的高漲，賞不應稍加忽視。茲提出關於辦理農貸的幾個現實問題，以喚起當局的注意，並供國人的硏究</p>
<p>第一是農貸的數量問題。照目前農貸每畝廿萬元，不足晨民實際需要的三十分之一。關於糧食生產貸款，每畝貸額僅規定廿萬至卅萬元；目前一張豆餅，卽需七八百萬元；而每畝最低需要豆餅一張，充作肥料，眞是杯水車薪，何濟於事！而且最近各地糧貸平均每畝貸額，祗有十餘萬元，僅及實際需要三十分之一。試問此種有名無實的農貸，如何能减輕農民經濟上的困難？而農貸的主要目的乃在增加糧食生產，區區之數，又怎樣能够希望它發生效果？所以大多數的農民，對於農貸，均不甚感覺興趣，甚至自願放棄的，也頗不乏人。</p>
<p>第二是發放農貸的時期問題。以農作的時今而言，糧貸在七月上旬貸出，方可不失時效。因爲在七月初，是農民靑黃不接最感困難的時候；以農作而論，那時田多已插秧，據農民談，至七月半以後施肥，卽不免失之太遲；而各地農貸機構，辦理糧貸，多係實物貸放，訂貨交貨運輸，均需要相當的時間。所以今夏辦理糧貸，必需於七月上旬前撥到各地，迅速訂貨，方可不失時效。但各地糧貸，現在有的僅撥到配額一半左右，貸款手續雖已辦齊；而款仍撥不到；如若長此遷延，很可能失掉稻田施肥時效，影響及今年的秋收，此種責任應由誰負？實在是不言可喩的。</p>
<p>第三是糧貸個別貸與農民的問題。最近農貸方面，大部份貸款，均係個別貸與農民，由農民自行經營處理；以京滬沿綫一帶而言，個別貸與農民的，卽佔百分之九十以上。但是個別貸款的數額，旣屬有限，發生的作用自不能大；農民零星經營，更不易見貸款的具體成果。社員與合作社僅發生貸款與還款的關係，與合作組織接觸機會，依舊不多，對合作之認識尤淺；而且目前由各鄕鎭保社，自行集資的，更不多見。此項貸款各社，僅收加息若干，有些合作社尙不够開又，對於增加社內公有財產一點，亦殊少貢獻。萬一　災荒或其他意外，貸款收回亦成問題。所以我們主張，嗣後各農貸機構，應嚴督各地分支行處，積極獎勵各社團，從事集體經營業務，其中如農產加工之機具，新式農具之購置，農村副業之設備等，尤爲重要。此項貸款成果旣易見，合作社收益情形，亦較明顯。</p>
<p>第四是辦理農貸的方式問題。我們認爲應該集中人力財力，避免資金的分散。現在各地農貸，幾乎究全是被動性質。地方士紳及各機關，多主張按鄉，鎭，保平均分配，不問組織健全與否，不管治安情形如何，均須貸放。但是合作事業，並非慈善事業，農貸更不是賑款。此項貸款，自有其特殊使命與必備條件。合則放，不合則不貸。故現在有些地方，東鄉申請貸東鄉，西鄉申請貸西鄉，事先毫無整個計劃，以致有限資金，零星分散於各地，監督旣不方便，流弊又極易發生。我們以爲嗣後各地農貸機構，於配額確定後，即應根據當地的主要作物產區的情形：合作事業是否發達？交通是否便利？治安是否良好？　農中農是否衆多等等條件，選定若干地區，據訂切實可行之分期實施計劃，集中人力財力，處處爭取主動，逐步按照計劃推行。貸款方式，儘可能採取集體經營，必可爲當地合作事業，樹立相當基礎，發揮合作之成果！</p>
<p>第五是改變帮助少數人發財之作風問題。不可否認的，過去各級農會及合作組織，除了小數健全者而外，大部份均操縱在土劣手中。故在農貨發放時，稍有疏忽，監督不嚴，此少數書寫之屬，即會將貸款任意轉移用途，營私舞弊。大多數的農民朱受其利，反而爲少戴人所利用。所以我們認爲，凡是辦理農貸的地方，如若發現此種現象，必須請當地行政機構，嚴加　處，殺一歡百，以免此　風蔓延到不可收拾。據我們調査所得，此類社團，大半賬目不公佈，會議經常不舉行，任意操縱業務，隨便揮霍，農貸若貸給此種社團，無非帮助少數人發財，間接促成農村財富的集中。所以我們要求當局，嗣後辦理農貸，應該特別重視貧農和中農，務使貸款能送到眞正迫切需要者之手中，千萬不能再聽任少數人利用農貸，作爲個人發財的資本。</p>
<p>要而言之，我國農材經過八年的抗戰，遵受敵僞的摧殘，勝利後共匪叛亂接踵而起，農村又受到共匪的荼毒，以致千孔百瘡，破爛到不可言狀。農村經濟已在那裏崩漬，勞苦的農民大衆無異置身於水深火熱之中，需要政府的救濟，是非常迫切的。這種情形也是政府當局所認知的，每年舉辦農貸，無非在解除農民在經濟上的困難，協助他們多施一點肥料，可以增加糧食的生產。二三年來辦理農貸的情形，雖然未能盡如理想，但是我們決不可「因噎廢食」，我們不但要求政府應該繼續辦理農貸，而且還希望主辦農貸者，隨時改進，俾使農貸眞正能發生其效果。不僅要减輕農民在經濟上的困難，而且還要達到增加糧食生產的目的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：聯合國調解人貝那多特今在安理會緊急會議中，請求安理會堅決干涉巴勒斯坦戰事，並宣佈採取各種阻止戰爭步驟之決心。貝氏籲請安理會立卽頒發停戰命令，違反命令者，將予制裁。言明此種命若能頒發，則阿猶之間，必又可休戰一個時期。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十三日電〕貝那多特向安全理事會提出報吿，以最有力之辭句，聲言巴勒斯坦衝突之擴大將引起世界戰爭，非由聯合國武力干涉，不能遏止聖地之劇變。貝那多特指出渠之斡旋任務係因分治，以色列國及移民等三大德結而擱淺。渠並鄭重表示，時間愈來愈侷促，猶阿如繼續堅持其立塲，戰爭即將擴大。渠建議安理會即派武裝部隊前往聖地，不然戰爭之狂潮將吞沒世界各部份，固不僅猶阿兩族而已。關於休戰期間聖地之局勢，貝氏謂，無論猶方或阿方均未因休戰而取得軍事上之利益，整個而論，渠之休戰監察團，因雙方前綫司令之大致均能恪遵休戰令而深感滿意。貝氏承認在目前交戰雙方意見懸殊的情形下，渠尙不知如何可以成立妥協辦法，但渠生張先使用每一外交上之方法，使猶阿恢復理智不果，將當由安全理事會採取行動。貝氏並未說明需要由聯合國派遣幾許軍隊始克濟事，亦朱說明此一國際軍將如何組織是否得包括蘇聯部隊，此等細則悉將由安理會決定。英駐安理會代表賈德幹詢問貝氏，是否仍持樂觀，貝氏未示可否，但曰：此事視安理會處置此一緊急局勢之實力而定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十三日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦戰事調解員貝那多特向聯合國安全理事會之報吿書已於昨夜分發各理事國代表。貝氏報吿書結論稱，聖地立即停戰不過爲第一步。「現在必須解決之問題則爲舉世是否願意聽任武力爲解決巴勒斯坦問題之方法。若然，則近東全部以及更大區域之和平必有許多危險」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十二日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦戰事調解員貝那多特今夜親自籲請英美兩國，力促安全理事會通過決議應付巴勒斯坦局勢。美代表傑索普與英代衷賈德幹均允一致行動促成停戰，惟其提案細則尙待調整。</p>

<p>台拉維夫之公報，文曰：據前綫報吿，北綫阿拉伯軍全面瓦解，猶軍追逐潰逃之叙利亞軍，前鋒已進入叙利亞境。聖地之戰况，已影響到開羅之棉花及證券市塲，今晨開市即一路疲軟，雖有埃機轟炸台拉維夫之訊，至午猶無起色。觀察家於指出阿拉伯無論在軍事上或政治上之躊躇狀態後，表示相信黎巴嫰之緊急會議，或將決定如果安理會於聆取貝那多特之報吿後，正式提出延長休戰之建議，即將予以接受。以色列公報報吿台城耶城公路綫上之戰况，謂猶軍業已完全控制該路自馬日台爾至拉特期之一段。並曰，猶軍已在從事準備以進攻阿拉伯之堅强據點拉特朗，打通至耶路撒冷之路綫。猶方前綫報吿復謂，猶軍在台拉維夫南二十七哩處，與埃及軍激戰竟夜，將埃軍完全擊潰。開羅報吿謂，埃及空軍殊爲活躍，埃轟炸機曾襲耶城西之猶軍陣綫，噴火式機則分襲台拉維夫及里達西南八哩處之阿基爾飛機塲。</p>

<p>（七）爲了關心南共內部所發生的情况，並爲了使南共領袖可能找一條路，走出這種情况起見，蘇共和其他各友黨的中委會決定在共產情報局的會議中，討論南共內部的情形。這種討論是根據正式的爲原則，因爲在共產情報局首次開會時，其他各國共黨的活動也曾被檢討過。各友黨雖有各種建議，以便在共產情報局討論南共的情形，但是南國領袖的答覆却是一個拒絕。他們藉口「沒有平等的權利」而拒不出席共產情報局的會議，用以避免各友黨正當的批評。</p>
<p>但是必須聲明，南國領袖這種話完全是假的，因爲人都知道，各國共黨在組織共產情報局的時候，曾訂下一個不容置辯的原則，就是每一黨都須將其活動向共產情報局報吿，而每一黨也都有權批評其他各黨。在九國共黨召開第一次會議時，南共曾廣泛地行使此項權利。南斯拉夫的拒絕在共產情報局面前淸算他們的活動，指示了該國違反各國共黨權利平等的原則，此舉無異於南國要求在共黨情報局中處於特權的地位。</p>
<p>（八）鑒於上述種種，共產情報局同意對南共局勢的再估價，同意對南共中委會錯誤行動的批判，並且同意蘇共中委會於本年三月至五月間致南共中委會函件中所述關於甫共錯誤行動的政治分析。共產情報局業已獲得一致的結諭，卽由於南共領袖們的反對自黨，反對蘇聯的意見，違背了馬克斯，列寗主義，以及拒絕參加共產國際情報局的態度，他們業已將自身列入反對南共的隊伍，他們脫離了反對帝國主義的社會主義聯合陣綫，走上了背叛勞工羣衆的國際團結的道路，並且走上了趨向國家宅義的過渡路綫。</p>
<p>共產情報局認為上述種種的結果，證明了南共中委會不惜將其自身和整個共黨脫離了國際共黨家庭，脫離了共黨聯合陣綫，就是說，脫離了共產情報局的行列。共產情報局認爲南共領導者所作的一切錯誤，係基於一項無可爭辯的事實，卽在該黨領導下的最近五至六個月以來，國家主義派公然活躍無所顧忌。南共的領導者業已遠離該黨的國際路綫傳統，而走上了國家主義的道路。南斯拉夫的領袖們在國際局勢上走上了錯誤的方向，並且因爲受到帝國主義的威脅而驚惶失措。他們以爲如果對帝國主義國家不斷讓步，必能得到到恩施，和帝國主義國家締結關於南斯拉夫獨立的協定，並且逐漸影響南斯拉夫人民使走上帝國主義國家所走的方向，卽資本主義的路綫。</p>
<p>同時，他們不聲不響地採取了布爾喬亞—國家主義的論題，卽資本主義對南斯拉夫獨立的禍害，要比較蘇聯來得少。南斯拉夫的領袖們並不知道，或者至少假裝不知道類似上述的國家主義意識，將要領導南國走上通常布爾喬亞共和國的道路，並且使南國在帝國主義者的面前喪失了國家的獨立。共產情報局並不懷疑在南共的中心，存在着充分健全的份子，他們是眞實効忠馬克斯，列寗主義的，他們忠於南共的國際路綫的傳統，同時對社會主義聯合陣綫忠心不貳。</p>
<p>這些南共的健全份子有一種目的，他們將迫使他們現在的黨領袖公開而忠實地承認所犯的錯誤，並且加以糾正，同時和國家主義脫離，以及種種方法佈置反抗帝國主義的社會主義聯合陣綫。或者，如果證明南共現在的領袖們不能够擔當這一工作，那麼健全份子起而代替他們的地位，從下層中崛起，建設南共新國際路綫的領導權。共產情報局毫不疑惑地確信南斯拉夫共黨能够達成這一任務。</p>

<h3 id="c96">Finch　FRS—140C　傳眞電報機 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 易曉東</p>
<p>Finch　FRS—140C傳眞電報機係專爲傳送公文信件而設計，其收發報部份同裝於一機壳內，外表美觀，機件精巧，電路雖繁，因接綫緊凑，且採用小型眞空管，故所佔地位不大，整個機件因此亦不過如一打字電報機般大小，至於使用方法，以機械多係自動，故甚簡便，値機者毌需特殊技術，唯如發生障礙，以機件裝置過於緊密，則頗惑不易迅速修復，茲就其電路與機械各部分略加叙述於次，並與本局現用西聯公司傳眞電報機稍加比較。</p>
<p>此傳眞電報機收報與發報兩部分同裝於一機壳內，各有一轉筒，由同步電動機帶動，同以每分180轉之速率旋轉；發報部分之光源，光電管及放大器同裝於一載箱上，發報轉筒旋轉105次時，載箱平行轉筒軸向右移動一吋，故掃描綫數爲每吋105條，而本局現有西聯公司傳眞機，其轉筒速率亦爲每分180轉，掃描綫爲每吋100條，故就收報精細程度及傳報速率比較，二者相差至微。</p>
<p>此機之收報方法，係在收報轉筒面上，裝有一突起之螺旋紋，螺距卽等於轉筒之長，而轉筒長度則與發報轉筒之圓週相等，另有一平行轉筒軸之印棒，壓於轉筒上，當轉筒旋轉時，印棒與轉筒之接觸點卽螺旋紋上之各點，收報紙經印棒轉筒之間向上移動，轉筒每轉一週，接觸點卽在紙上掃描一綫，使轉筒轉105次，收載紙向上移一吋，則接觸點在紙上掃描次數完全與原件被光源掃描之次數相等，收報紙爲一種特製之電化學紙，信號電流施於轉筒，由螺旋紋上流經收報紙，印棒而返電源，收報紙上凡有電流流過之處卽變成黑色，其變黑程度且與電流强弱約成正比，故亦可接收濃淡不同之照片，圖畫，經試驗結果，其成績似較西聯公司所用接收方法爲佳，所用收報紙爲8　吋寬之紙捲，連續經轉筒印棒之間向上移動，故每收報一張之後，無須換紙手續，且工作者可於收報時間內觀察收報情形是否良好，隨時通知對方調節或重新再發，唯此種收報紙必須保持適當之濕度，為其不便之處。</p>
<p>發報原稿之裝置與取下，都係自動，但發報紙之寬，必須爲8　吋至2　吋，長則在／1吋以下均可，發報原稿裝於轉筒上係由二排小釘釘住，致使紙上兩邊釘有釘眼，自動裝置機件稍有失靈時，可能將原報損壞，而不能發出；自動取下之機件失靈時，也可能損壞原報，實爲此機器之缺點。</p>
<p>光電方面係採用一集焦之光源點，照於原件上，其反光則射於光電管上，此時光電管之輸出爲一直流脈動電流，經直流放大器6AG5而得反相之轍出—光源掃照黑色部分時，輸出最大；掃照白色部分時則最小—另有一相同之放大器6AG5，其輸出與前者之輸出平衡，作用在使輸出不致發生畸變。</p>
<p>此機之調變方法爲利用一平衡調變器，兩6BE推挽相聯，由一振蕩器6AG5產生所需要之副載波—1700週—·利用反相管（Phase　inverter）6AG5得二振幅相同而相位相反之載彼，分別輸入二平衡調變管之第二柵極；由平衡放大器輸出之信號電壓則同時輸至二管之第一柵極，板路內乃產生一調幅波，而原來之脈動信號電壓在輸出中並無存在，故瞬變電壓均吿消除。</p>
<p>西聯公司傳眞機之調變方法，係採用機械之斬波器，故其光電管之輸出卽爲支流，可利用音頻放大器，是其優點，惟斬波器裝於光路系統中頗覺笨重，其載波頻率旣不穩定，又難得對稱，不及Einch用振蕩器者好。</p>
<p>經調變後之信號，最後經6J6管放大而接至輸出綫，此處同時引一部分送入本機器之收報部分，俾發端値機人員能監察傳送情形之良否。</p>
<p>至收報部分之電路則較簡單，經6BE66AG5與兩6V6並聯放大，硒整流器整流後，卽得原有之直流脈動電流，接至收報轉筒，流經收報紙而描繪出原件之複製。</p>
<p>另一部分爲自動同相設備，此機爲在收端電動機與電源之間聯一繼電器，因繼電器之作用斷絕電源，同步電動機產生滑動現象，使收報轉筒改變其與發報轉筒相對之位置而得同相，控制繼電器之關鍵，爲在發端轉筒每轉一週後發出一同相信號，發報轉筒軸上裝有四不同形狀之偏突輪，第一輪與第二輪並聯接於發報電路最後一級放大器之板路，平常時第一輪接通板路電壓，因此信號電流得輸出，但當光源掃照發報一綫完畢與二綫開始之間，相當於轉筒旋轉45度之時間內——因發報紙較轉筒圓週爲短，故在此時間內，無信號電流輸出一—第一輪斷絕放大管之板壓，但在此45度中之25度，第二輪接通板壓，此時第三輪已將光電管之陽極電壓斷絕，其斷絕時間相當於45度中之35度，故放大管所輸出者實爲一相當於25度長之完全黑色信號，在此黑色信號前後則各有相當於10度之白色信號，轉筒每轉一週，卽光源每掃照一綫後，皆有此一信號輸出，此卽同相信號。</p>
<p>收端接收此同相信號後，與信號電流同經6BE6與6AG5二級放大，然後經陰極藕合器而輸入至自動同相電路：此電路內有二同相管（2—6AG5），其屏柵極電壓由轉筒軸上第四偏突輪控制，平常無電壓，僅當光源掃照於兩綫之間相當於轉筒一週之7度時——卽上述45度之中間7度——接通電壓，若同相信號適於此時輸入，經二剪波管（雙二極管6AL5之兩部分）與此二同相管之電路後，對多諧振動器（Multivibrator）6J6無作用，繼電器亦無作用，電動機照原來情形帶動轉筒旋轉，此種情形表示發端與收端二轉筒之相對位置無誤，卽所謂同相。但當同相信號輸入同相電路，而同相管屛柵極並無電壓時——由於二轉筒相對位置不同——，第二同相管輸出電流，使多諧振動器有扳機trigger）作用，聯於此管之放大器6AG5）產生板路電流，此種電流經繼電器綫圈，使繼電器作用，斷絕電動議電源，其斷絕時間適使電動機滑動一電極矩離，因此使收報轉簡停頓一下；若停頓後之轉筒位置仍與發報轉筒不同，同相信號之時間仍與同相管施有屏柵極電壓之時間不符合，繼電器再作用，直俟二轉筒相對位置正確時方吿停止，此時乃得到同相，以後兩電動機卽照正常狀態帶動轉筒旋轉。</p>
<p>此種同相設備，在此簡小之傳眞機內，似覺太繁，蓋當收發二機之電源相同時，只須開機之始得到同相，以後卽可保持同相不變，若二端電源不同，勢必另加同步電源設備，故亦只須開始得到同相卽可，而此種設備爲每一週發出同相信號，除開始數信號外，其餘信號似無何作用，局用西聯公司之傳眞機卽爲在每報開始時自動同相，所用電路較爲簡單，但當輸送電路情形有改變時，仍須人工調節，二者似各有利弊。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，Finch式傳眞機較爲新式，試騐成績，尙稱滿意，唯機械方面，若能更求精確靈活，經久不損，則頗可採用也。</p>
<h3 id="c97">電報掛號的故事 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 洪鼎華</p>
<p>故事的開始</p>
<p>一天，一張樸實而誠摯的臉，向着公衆服務檯的小姐問：</p>
<p>「小姐，請問打電報在那裏掛號？」</p>
<p>「打電報……那裏掛號？」小姐驚詫的目光，停留在陌生人的臉上，心裏暗忖着，這位客人一定弄錯了，於是，本營業員應有的禮貌與責職，不嫌繁冗地加以解釋：</p>
<p>「先生，你弄錯了，打電報不用掛號。」她拉開抽屜，檢出一張紙來：「這是電報紙，請你拿去，寫好了交給四號窗口便行了。」</p>
<p>什麼叫「電報掛號」</p>
<p>打電報要掛號，那是誤會，原來有一種叫「電報掛號」的東西在那人的腦海裏作祟。那麼究竟什麼是「電報掛號」呢？這裏我們先替它下一個定義。</p>
<p>「電報掛號」是用戶在電信局裏掛的一個號碼字，代表他戶名和地址的所在，利用這個掛號，用戶可以取得拍發電報上的便利和節省不必要的報費支出。</p>
<p>現在先說它的第一個好處——便利，迅速。</p>
<p>在電信掛到了電報掛號後，你的外埠分處往來行莊或朋友們便可利用它來發電報。（當然你已讓他們先知道了你「掛」的什麼「號」。電信局對於掛號戶的來報，處理起來比一般來得簡捷，用一個現成的木戳（關於這戳子下面會談到），蓋在電報信封上來代替人工書寫的麻煩和避免錯誤，並且可以達到迅速的目的</p>
<p>再說它第二個好處——省報費。</p>
<p>假使你要拍一個電報給「重慶林森路一百三十五號大華企業公司」，數「數字，除了重慶兩字依照規定祗作一字計算外，連同其他的字單是收報人地址就有十六個字。（就是你把一百三十五寫在括號裏變成（135）仍須十二字。）現在假定那家大華公司在當地電信局的掛號是1129，那麼這撈什子的長達十六個字的地址變成了簡單的1129重慶，祗算兩個字，比原來要省十四個字，依尋常電一萬元一字算，一次可省十四萬，加急則省廿八萬，平均一日一封，一月累積，要八百多萬，一年呢，一億出關，再加上拆息，不是吃虧更大嗎？</p>
<p>怎樣去掛你的「電報掛號」？</p>
<p>電信局爲大衆服務，不但要使電報迅速，而且處處替用戶作經濟打算。「電報掛號」便是顯明的例子。</p>
<p>究竟怎樣去弄一個掛號呢？下面告訴你一些辦法：</p>
<p>電報掛號分華文與洋文兩種，華文以四個阿拉伯字組成，洋文以四個以上不超過十個英文字母祖成，但是上海因爲情形特殊，從0000到9999的一萬個華文掛號不够用，今年一月七日起破例採用了六字掛號，這樣定額可以擴充，用戶便不致向隅了。</p>
<p>諸位大概還記得以前每逢月之一日，老淸早電信局門口一字長蛇陣的在軋掛號，有的甚至遠道趕來，軋不到而空手回去的，自從採用六字掛號後，這種情形現在已沒有了，用戶們可以隨時掛到一個掛號。</p>
<p>電報掛號的期限，分爲長期一年和短期三月兩種。掛號費一年一百二十萬元，三月三十萬元，一次付淸。</p>
<p>明白了這些，現在你可以到電信局掛號組（長治路廿五號）去要一張電報掛號聲請書，把上面的掛號字樣，戶口，地址，電話號碼，掛號期限一一塡上，簽名蓋章後，連同掛號費一併交與裏面的辦事員。</p>
<p>這裏有一點要請注意，假使你掛的是華文掛號，「掛號字樣」一欄讓它空着，電信局會根據你地址的屬於那一區域而給你一個適當的號頭，並不是任你挑選或指定的，因爲上海用戶實在擁擠，你所選定的掛號很容易早被人掛去。</p>
<p>假使你掛的是洋文掛號，請不要用國名省名或城市街道一類的專門名詞（PROPER　NOUN），以及其他普通名詞COMMON　NOUN）。最理想的是行名各字的INITIAL加上一個CO，例如遠東淸潔公司（FAR　EASTERN　SANITARY　CO）的掛號是FESCO。</p>
<p>當你從掛號組辦事員的手裏取到一張電報掛號的憑照後，三天後便可以開始使用了。</p>
<p>爲了加速投送你的電報起見，須要你備一個長1　吋，闊　吋的橡皮木戳，把你的「掛號字樣」，「戶名」，「地址」，「電話」各項刻在上面，交給掛號組備用。</p>
<p>幾件注意事項</p>
<p>一，關於遷移——遇到你的地址有遷移的時候，請你備函通知掛號組，以便更改後按照新址投遞。你的新址如果在另一區域時（電信局的投遞區和郵局的不同），並須將原有掛號惡照逕送掛號組註銷，另給新掛號及新憑照。</p>
<p>二，關於期滿——掛號期滿的前三天，掛號組有一張「電報掛號期滿通知卡」寄給你。你若繼續掛用，請於收到通知後，依式塡寫，簽名蓋章，連同應繳掛號費送交掛號組另給新憑照；假使不打算續掛，在期滿翌日，掛號便失去效用。但是，爲便利用戶起見，長期掛號在期滿後二月短期掛號在期滿後一月，如仍有來報，予以試送一次，逾期則停止投送。</p>
<p>三，關於轉讓——電報掛號不能轉讓他人，以免混淆，但是碰到公司改組或其他原因而須要更改戶名時，可以備函申請，詳述理由，另行繳費後繼續使用，否則即予註銷。</p>
<p>今日的電報掛號</p>
<p>電報掛號在今天，已被普遍利用着，據掛號組最近的統計，華文掛號已超過一萬三千個，洋文掛號亦在六千個以上，申請新掛號的也日有數十起。</p>
<p>電報掛號會給你許多便利，間接帮助你事業的發展，收費又不貴，那麼，朋友，請到電信局去掛一個號吧！</p>
<h3 id="c98">電碼的革新 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 張斌恢</p>
<p>—介紹成語電碼書</p>
<p>近幾年來，國內使用電報的人爲了要减少電報的字數，常常把相連的字或通俗的成語編纂成電碼，這雖然是一個好方法，但多半只是限於某一個單位，或某種專門事業所適用。不但應用範圍太狹窄，同時也未臻盡善，不能普遍的使用。有時候電信局方面因爲電文字意不明，作了密碼計費，對於發電報人亦所省無幾。</p>
<p>交通部有鑒於這些缺點，便指派了若干電信方面的專家，分別硏究收集了各種材料，包括各種機關名稱和各種事業方面在電報內常用的辭句，以及和日常生活有關的各種名詞，編成一本能使大衆所適用的成語電碼書。用新頴的分類方法，以便於檢字。這本電碼新編的優點，有：</p>
<p>第一，節省報費，一個字碼，就可代替一組字。</p>
<p>第二，因爲一碼代替一組字，在電報傳遞的效率上也增進不少，無論在翻譯的手續上，或電報的傳遞上，都將時間縮短，電信的效率因之提高。</p>
<p>第三，在物質上講，也省了不少工料。</p>
<p>第四，在人力上講，電碼的翻譯，電報的處理，都可省出不少手續。</p>
<p>第五，莵集的成語範圍廣大，可以普遍的適用。</p>
<p>第六，分類與編排新穎，無論譯碼或譯字均非常便利</p>
<p>第七，內容充實，正編之後，尙附有註音字母，英文字母各種常用符號，代日韻目，時人姓名，外國地名等，以備參考。</p>
<p>成語電碼的創始，的確是電信界一個新的貢獻。全書分上下二册，共十萬碼，凡電碼新編中之單字，均已包括在內，故應用非常方便，該書於十月中可望出版，自即日起開始預約，預約每部（二册）暫收成本費一百五十萬元，預約期至本年八月底截止，辦理預約地點爲福州路上海電信局業務稽査室。</p>

<p>電信常識講話（十二）　張家鈺</p>
<p>第五講寫在電文裏的文字（續）</p>
<p>華文密語電文，雖則也用中文寫成，但在譯成電碼發送時，却幷不根據交通部所編的電碼新編譯出而是按照發報人與收報人雙方互相訂定的另一種密碼本譯出，因此，除非備有同樣的密碼本，就無法明瞭電文的內容，卽使經辦這張電報的電局職員也不例外，所以，密碼電文的特點是容易保持機密。按照交通部的章程，華文密語限用四個或五個數目字搆成一組</p>
<p>講到這裏，或許有些讀者有到利用密碼可以增進通信撥密的特點而有意試用密碼發電，那末，筆者可以順便吿訴你一個好消息：交通部爲顧客的利益打算，從戰前開始，早已聘請專家，從事編製華文成語密碼，這種密碼每組最多可以代替十四個字，不但機密而且省費，現在已在排印，不久就可出版發售。</p>
<p>洋文明語電文，是用某一種外國文字寫成的電文，必須意義明顯，詞句連貫，不失字面的原來解釋。洋文明語電文裏，也准酌用不含秘密意義的字母或數目字組合，電報掛號，商務標識，滙兌行市，以及尋常或商業通信上習慣使用的各種縮寫字樣例如FOB，CIF，CAF，SVP，LBS，YD，DR，DORS，STLG等等。</p>
<p>洋文暗語規定用五個字母搆成一組，根據收發報人雙方約定的密本譯出，它的特點是不但機密，而且省費，歐美各國都有編纂完備的洋文成語密本發行，上海各西書店或舊書舖有時也有出售。國際暗語電報的報價，照同類明語電報便宜百分之四十，所以平日國際電報較多的機關商行，大都利用暗語發報。</p>
<p>洋文綴字語包括：（一）單個或成組的洋文字母，旣不用五個字母搆成一組（如洋文暗語），又沒有明確的解釋，或（二）表面上雖是完整的洋文字，但詞句幷不連貫，不合字面的原來意義，或（三）寫有秘密意義的單個數目字或數目字組合。</p>
<p>凡用華洋文或明密語很合寫成的電報，電局也能收受；唯一的例外是：凡含有秘密意義的數目字和字母的混合組合，或字母，數目字，和標點符號混寫的組合，一律不准行用。（第五講完）</p>
<p>第六講　怎樣計算字數</p>
<p>「知其然而不知其所以然」，這是我們時常聽到的一句俗語，它準確的指出，凡事單靠經驗是不够的；就拿撰擬電稿來說，筆者因爲職務上的關係，有時需要翻査電底，發覺平日來去電報比較多的發報人，大多都懂得怎樣把電稿寫得簡單扼要，可是，就我們內行的人看來，不但「字數愈少，報費愈低」算不得是絕對的定律，卽使就照電稿原文書寫，也宋始沒有更其叨打的辦法可想，祗要讀者們能熟習電信章則，隨時靈活運用，定能確切達到「以最小的代價換取最大的效果」的終極目的。</p>
<p>在一張電報裘面，收報人名址和電文是佔居字數最多的兩個主要部份，而且除開一些特殊的例外，一般的說，後者所包含的字數，大都比較前者爲多，更且有關節省收報人名址的字數的各種方法如像前面所講的採用電報掛號。電話號數。郵箱號數替代收報人名址等等辦法，雖則手續都很簡易，但必須通渦收報人的合作，纔能做到，換句話說，如果收報人並不向收報當地電局聲請掛號，或者收報人沒有裝用電話，或則並不租用郵箱，那末，發報人意圖减少收報人名址部份的字數的願望，也就無從實現；所以，我們也可以說：能够讓發報人握有主動權的，也祗有從想法節省電文字數着手。下面所需介紹的是各種電文字數的計算方法，正因爲節省電文字數可以從電稿裏找到的實例俯拾卽是，所以筆者不準備消極的從電稿去找尋實例，而願積極的把電局計算電文字數的基本方法作一廣泛的介紹，也惟有這樣，纔能帮助諸信譯　　得澈底的瞭解。</p>

<p>世界各地的時間，因爲太陽光綫角度差別，並不一致，而時間在電信交通的傳輸上是一個極重要的因素。有時爲了發報地方和收報地方時間的不同，使收報人對於電報傳遞所需的時間發生疑惑，認爲電信局在電報的傳遞上誤了點，其實全是時差的關係，現在願將我國各地的時差列表如下：</p>

<h3 id="c103">國行決大量拋售物資　物從昨略見下挫　當局抽緊銀根行局有鉅額差進 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲澈底平抑物價，已決定大量拋售物資。昨日特撥慶豐·華陽·兩廠細布提單一萬六千一百疋，交請紗管會，迅即轉發紡建儘量拋售。昨日本市米市穩定，物價略見下跌，此與當局執行之檢査倉庫及拋售物資政策，有密切關係。</p>
<p>另據商界人士表示：立法院會議中，除堅決反對發行大鈔外；復在審査預算時，決定以出售美援物資款項，平衡國家財政收支；凡此對市塲心理，均有好影響。惟目前因游資集滬，銀根仍鬆，除非拋售政策能持久實行，否則物價情形仍難樂觀。</p>
<p>又訊：滬市物價狂濤未見消滅，總統特表關切，連日午後曾致電國行劉攻芸，垂詢一切，幷作指示。聞當局爲平定物價，決定從根本上着手，大量拋售物資，抽緊銀根，昨日行局之鉅額差進，乃抽緊銀根之開始。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日本市銀根，先鬆後緊，四行兩局一庫，於銀錢業票據交換中，因昨日拋售棉紗解款，有空前之差進，總額達三二八七三億之鉅。就中以中國銀行差進一一七〇一億爲數最鉅，中央銀行差進一一〇四五億，交通銀行差進四五六七億，農民銀行差進一九四九億，郵匯局差進二〇八七億，中合作金庫差進一五六六億，中信局差進四二億，商業行莊大交換差出一七二一一億，小交換差出二七六九〇億。外商銀行差進亦創空前紀錄，總額爲一二〇二八億。</p>
<p>據中央銀行方面估計，日來因現鈔缺乏，商業行莊大都以本票應付提現客戶，故預計若千行莊經此抽緊後，應付將較困難，至今日銀根，該行估計，將再趨緊俏云。</p>
<h3 id="c104">國行恢復拋棉工作　幷搬出大量布疋交中紡拋售 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>停頓已久之拋棉工作，昨又行開始。中紡昨日掛牌，代中央銀行開售棉花，幷規定辦法八項：（一）請購棉花，暫以第六區棉紡工業同業公會會員廠之急需補充原料者爲限。請購者自行塡寫請購單，開明願購數量（單位市担），及每祖單價，加蓋紗廠及負責人圖章投入箱內。（三）請購單收至十一時止。（四）貸款限本日繳淸，（十一時前可繳支票，十二時繳本票，十二時後須以現鈔解交）。（五）貨存交通銀行倉庫。（六）最低標價二億三千萬元。（七）售棉花爲棧交，籽什水份按規定標準。（八）本日售棉爲陜西棉。</p>
<p>昨日共售出棉花三百担，收回國幣六百九十億，今日照常拋售。又中央銀行爲澈底平抑物價，已決定大量拋售物資，昨特撥慶豐華陽兩廠細布提單一萬六千一百疋。交請紗管會迅即轉發中紡，盡量拋售。</p>
<p>紗市砌高</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市況，以隔日下跌過暴，引起客帮及複製廠商乘低收吸，喊價至爲堅昂。最後四十二支藍鳳爲十五億五千萬，軋升一億。四十二支寳光明日出價爲十四億，卅二支銀月初做隔日出十二億五千萬，嗣因紗管會配價較低。最後當日出十二億　二十支雙馬現交十一億，後以同業受銀根緊迫，見高吐售者多，低至十億關邊，結果十億零七百萬，明日出十一億有成交。其餘各級粗細紗亦均軋升五千萬至七八千萬不一，全日成單六十四紙，計成交二百三十七件。</p>
<p>棉布堅挺</p>
<p>昨日棉布市況，晨開因有檯面帮吸納，市盤步秀，嗣以紡建公司標售，染廠絀於頭寸，吐售坯布，布商獲利亦賣，價乃下瀉，迨至收時，浮空抵補又轉堅挺。塲外龍頭細布初喊三千九百五十萬，曾高至四千二百萬，後以獲利了售，卒爲三千七百五十萬有成交，市塲喊三千六百五十萬結束，軋升一百五十萬元。其餘各細布及嗶嘰漂布士林布等，亦一致捉俏。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司標售彩球細布，自塡價爲三千三百萬至三百五十萬，陽光細布價爲三千三·四百萬元，金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰三千五白五十萬至六百五十萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡繼續拋布，昨日拋出共一七四五〇疋，被單五二〇條，總金額爲五七二一九〇百萬元。又代紗管會標售八八〇疋，金額爲二九，一六八百萬元。拋紗仍舊共二八八件，金額爲二九一六八百萬元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市毛紡織業代表程年彭·唐嘩如·楊立人·等，爲該業特種外幣存單事，於昨日上午赴央行訪謁兪總裁。該業之外幣存單共三百萬美元，代表等要求將五月三十日以前者，抵用四五兩期之進口限額，五月三十日以後者，按央行之牌價結算。兪氏當時之答覆爲：此事雖由毛紡織業提出，但與其他各業有關，須先加以研究調査後，方能決定辦法。毛紡織業代表擬於一二日後，再度赴央行請願。</p>
<p>又訊：關於無證到埠物資之外匯存單，進出口業已屢次與央行兪總裁洽商發放技術問題。此批外幣存單爲數極鉅，央行過去爲一時權宜，不惜拋售遠期外匯，但今日顯已遭遇重大困難，因以目前央行外幣頭寸之短缺，支付大成問題。過去曾有按牌價支付之說，但進口商方面堅決反對，要求央行履行契約，勢成價局。現悉此事仍在金融當局詳細研究中，日內可望有具體決定。</p>

<p>本市敎育局舉辦大規模的中學自然科學成績展覽會，筆者按期分別前往參觀，費了竟日的時間，竟有樂此不惓之意。</p>
<p>第一，科學是枯燥無味的，不容易引起大衆興趣，這次展覽會中各校能有生動的表演，出人意料。尤其第一會塲中，格致陳列室動的怖目更多，如飛機模型的試飛，大山模型的噴發，電動火車模型的開動，變色廣吿屛顏色變化，各種袖珍小馬達的開動，分子模型的活用，幻燈的表演，短波無綫電操縱的飛機模型，都是由敎師們設計，學生們自製。開幕時當塲表演，頗得各方讚許。李敎育局長並對自製操縱機之學生林鶴嗚，鼓勵備至，允將私人短波無綫電之器材，設法贈予，以資勸勉，於是格致陳列室之參觀者，眞是萬頭攢動，濟濟一堂。又大德產科學校自製受精模型一座，說明受精之理。再緝槼中學裝有收音機一具，終日開放，音樂悠揚，爲會塲生色不少。第二會塲中法中學陳列室關於無綫電製品規模較大，有無綫電發達史模式，繪成簡單岡解，由敎師表演機構撥動聲光電卽迎續發生，目不睱接，堪稱壯觀。另有聖芳濟初中學生所製平裝七燈收音機，綫路分明，製造精美，亦屬不可多得。</p>
<p>第二，各校所製的模型均爲儀器公司所未有，而對於敎學確有極大的供獻。在第二會塲中淸心女中分子構造結晶模型合價模型，使學生容易明瞭分子中原結搆情形，帮助敎學功用頗大。中國中學全套立體幾何模型，有百餘種之多，洵稱盡善盡美。第一女中各項化工製造之步驟，結搆精緻，說明淸晣，亦屬極有價値之出品。</p>
<p>綜合各校師生成絞表演部份，都極生動，設計部份尤富敎學價値，當此社會極不安定，生活難以維持之時，各校校長師生，孜孜不惓，埋頭苦幹，實屬科學界前途之光榮。（心平）</p>

<p>民國卅五年夏，花旗橘子滿街飛，千元可購四枚至五枚，民族工業家悚然憂之，以爲外貨不可任其汎濫，如今果然不汎濫了，一個月前，花旗蜜橘已賣到六十萬一只，而民族工業凋蔽如故，我輩當時食花旗橘子者，如今連本國橘子也吃不起了。</p>
<p>同年春，筆者在馬路旁購新到之派克墨水一瓶，計八百元，後來賤到過六百元，時爲文取稿酬，每千字四千元，計可購墨水五瓶，然已不及戰前最低千字兩元之數遠矣。前日購派克墨水一瓶，計一百二十萬元，不知以此墨水作稿，能値多少元千字？而領到此千字多少元之稿費時，墨水又値多少元一瓶矣！</p>
<p>際此亂世，富者益富，蔚爲豪門與準豪門，貧者益貧，輾轉溝壑，要說利害相共，痛癢相關，戞戞乎難哉！當人人想作楊妹的時候，自然會發現楊妹。楊妹不食蓋已九年，而其名獨彰於九年之後，某故安在？可以思過半矣。</p>
<h3 id="c140">高橋海濱 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>在戰前，每當炎夏天氣晴朗的時候，高橋海濱浴場是一個極誘人的消夏塲所。在那交混着自然與人工的美感和享樂的」天堂」之中，曾使多少人留戀不捨；衣香鬢影裏，也曾造成多少悲歡離合的故事………歲月在烽火與動盪中逝去，刦後餘生，在這黄浦江畔不禁又想起了它。</p>
<p>一個初夏的日子，間歇的微雨阻擋不住我們對高橋海濱的懷　，一行三人興冲冲地踏上了市輪渡的甲板。倚欄遠眺，江風拂面，前塵往事，又兜上了心頭。</p>
<p>到高橋，又微微地下了陣細雨，公共汽車只有到鎭上的，幸而我們帶有脚踏車，看看雲層中尙隱有陽光，再因惦念海濱心濃，便不顧雨點，上車前進。通海濱的是一條頗平坦的煤屑路，兩旁綠色的田野，牧童懶坐牛背上，小橋流水，全是鄕村情味。二十五分鐘後，我們到達了海濱。</p>
<p>一切都變了！</p>
<p>海濱旅館祗留下個殘破的大門，寂寞地矗立在風雨之中。進門，就是一個大水潭，四周雜草叢生。後進的樓房下層還好，也許有人居住那兒，然而抬頭一望，樓上却空無所有，殘破不堪。</p>
<p>海濱浴塲的大門外表看來還無恙，踏上了數十級的石級，抬頭還可看見「高橋海濱浴塲」幾個黑字，可是到了上面，却又不免倒抽了口氣。前後的牆都沒有了，窗也沒有了，只有十幾個工人在那兒躱雨，　大了好奇的眼睛對我們凝望着、</p>
<p>我們看見海了，是一片浩闊黄色的海水。沿岸疏疏地留了幾株小樹，搖曳在微風細雨中。可是，擺在我們前面的，却還是一大塊高低不平充滿着水窪和亂生着野草的泥地。它的傾斜度很大，加上雨中泥濘，我幾次想越過，總因太滑不敢嘗試。最後，揀了條石子舖成的小道，繞到海邊</p>
<p>雨水已漸漸地由細小而停了，不一會，陽光已照在我們的身上；但是我們的心裏却有一種說不出的失望和惆悵。海塘塌了下去，除去沿岸的一部份還平整地存在外，其餘的大塊石塊都零亂地堆在下而，木樁也陷入了水中，祗露出了一排頭在水面。一片混濁的海水，就這樣地伸展到無限的天際，沒有沙灘，也沒有標誌。</p>
<p>包圍蒲我們的是無比的寗靜，祗有海潮拍岸，發出了有節奏的單調的聲音。遠處海天相連，帆影點點，一隻客船悠悠地開過，一縷輕烟淡淡地劃破了晴空。</p>
<p>我們回顧四周，聞無一人，整個海濱就祗我們三個遊客。回憶起昔年此處曾陶醉了多少美麗快樂的靈魂，盪漾過多少笑聲歡語，誰想到而今只落得如此的寂寞和懷涼！</p>
<p>爲了把念起見，我們依然以海爲背景，拍了幾張照。滄海桑田，一種落漢之感充滿心頭。</p>
<p>暮色中歸來，像是失去了什麽似的，祇覺得空虛。昔日往事祗成夢痕，此去除了算是憑弔之外，還能算什麽呢！</p>

<p>美國的書市塲中，往往有整套的私家藏書出售，其中不乏名貴的古本，售價頗爲昂貴，年來因銷路呆滯，轉形不振。例如一八六五年版的「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」，由作者題署贈於湯麥斯·配尼氏者，在一九四〇年售至美金一萬五千三百元的高價，最近市價爲美金三千四百元。又如狄更斯所著一八四三年版的「骨董肆」，上有狄氏的題字，在一九四一年售至四百五十元，現售二百元。査爾斯·蘭姆所撰劇本「約翰·伍特維」原稿，在一九四一年售三千六百元，現售一千四百元。華盛頓的一千七百九十七年日記抄，在一九四一年售一萬元，現售五千二百元。</p>
<p>美國書市慘淡的情形，蓋由於買賣兩稀，書業中人鑒於前途黯淡，裹足不前，書價乏人支持，更呈每况愈下之勢。本來，在過去七十五年中，紐約書市塲的許多初版英國文藝作品，一向比倫敦高昂，現在却反而比倫敦便宜。論者謂此或係英國採用嚴格外匯統制下的暫時現象，一俟恢復常態後，美國書市塲與英國書市塲的定價，當可趨於一致也。</p>

<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>虛霩園者，俗稱曾園，曾孟樸先生晚年息影之所也。園在常熟之西城，面對城牆，廣可數十畝，假山曲折，池荷萬柄，舊爲吾家侍御公（諱岱）之「小輞川」，屠隆爲之記。後荒廢幾三百年。迨孟樸之祖退　先生，（名熙文，清道光庚辰舉人，選用敎論。）以喪其次子日章（字闇谷），因大興土木，構築園林，以遣悲懷。先已在西山塘涇岸其宅之西，構明瑟山莊，李越縵爲之記。乃復在九萬圩建築園林，號日「虛霩邨居」，先成「歸耕課讀廬」，其北水閣曰「水天閒話一。</p>
<p>退　先生卒，其三子君表先生（孟樸之父，名之撰，光緒乙亥恩科舉人，官刑部郞中，著述極富。）繼承先志，乃吿厥成。一時名士，趨之若驚，若李越縵吳淸卿趙惠甫輩，均嘗作客其間。孟樸先生所著「魯男子」一書中所稱魯園者，卽指此園也。風華旖旎，草木增輝，其韶事流傳，虞山耆舊類能言之。後孟樸先生奉母居此，更添築洋樓。復於夏日廣設茶座，延游客，名流以詩投贈無虛日。孟樸先生卽卒於此園。歿後，海內文學家羣集「逍遙遊」開會追悼，議在此園闢室紀念，復欲爲刻銅像。不幸倭亂旋作，常熟淪陷，此園遂蕪壞不治，藏書盡散，先生譯著書若「囂俄全集，一雪曇夢傳奇」，「後漢書藝文志考證」等竟論斤出；號爲天下孤本之初板法文本「茶花女遺事一亦不知去向。園中藏汚納穢，無所不有。樹木斬伐一空，窗櫺戶牖，半爲薪料，屋瓦亦揭去其半，是皆孟樸先生之甥某所爲也。楊无恙光生湖海歸來，稅居於此，爲補植垂柳，因賦一詩曰：「平仲樓桑與匠期，亭榱廊檻廖廖炊。羊甥乞墅淸陰减，折柳人來補一枝」。孟樸賢嗣虛白先生輩，爲國宣勞，久客不歸，敦重親誼，雅不忍問訊於此也。然游斯園者，風景逈異，舉目全非，則不無今昔之感耳！虞山名園，若「燕谷」「壺隱」「靜圃」「之園」等，自經倭亂，無不崩榛塞路，興復無期，是則一園之興廢，有繫於一國之盛衰也。予大母爲孟樸先生從女兄，少日朝夕過斯園，目擊其盛時，夏秋之交，每折得荷花面歸。今大母歿已十一年，乃仍偕吾友祁君時造此園，共无恙先生談詩於「水天閒話」，无恙先生贈詩所謂：「溪橋勃　有祁錢，逐日于喁到水天」者也。低徊家國，黯然殊難爲懷，則不第爲斯園傷感已耳。</p>

<p>讀十一日大成君戒烟難一文，　有同感，於是也來一談。</p>
<p>大槪文人戒烟，類多迫於經濟，所謂基礎不固，生活動搖，不能開源，惟有節流一途。日暮途窮，亦大可哀也。</p>
<p>筆者抽烟，垂十七年的歷史，當初因爲涉世應酬，不可一日無此君，尤其是禮尙往來，少它不得。慢慢地成了嗜好，替自己找出了許多理由，譬如飯後一支成仙也，車廂人擴防疫也，看報邊抽一樂也…名目繁多，不克備載。其後批課卷，開會議，寫文稿，塗漫畫，無往而不宜，在在皆需要。手頭落空，中心搖搖，即子夜出門購買，不能謂爲小題大做也。</p>
<p>近來收入有限，支出無窮，於是決心戒之，已有七日。初則硬硬頭皮，尙無所謂。人來敬我，一槪謝絕，即理髮店學徒遞來，亦含笑不納。烟缸烟盒却不曾毁棄，（原因是生平戒過好多次，常常徒然損失了一些東西，不多時還仍舊重起爐灶。）却是朝夕對此，觸景生情，三朝而心癢，五朝而在宴會中接受二支，而今七日矣！此時也，自某醫院探病出來，那香烟攤又似乎專向我挑撥，我終於屈服了，「決心」從眼前幻滅，忙不迭地擦上了柴梗，仰望天空，長吁一縷，頓覺世界又恢復到美化，不再那麽懶洋洋一點沒得勁了。奇怪！幾天來昏骨欲睡的感覺，幾乎立刻就消失殆盡；幾天來怕見而想見的香烟標價，索性如熟讀唐詩般隨時可以　答　流了。</p>
<p>同到妻的面前，又吃了這幾句：「早說別戒它，少吸點不也行嗎？你這個人，眞是！」</p>
<p>於是又燃了第二支，大胆地抽，却是卑怯地笑。不免給她一個很可憐很可恥的印象，可是我還有什麽方法把這印象消滅於無形呢？</p>
<p>經濟基礎還是不固，問題還是問題。經第五支攷慮的結果，決心（它又來了！）每天就「煞住」在這個限度。可笑的一個限度！</p>

<p>成都入署，華氏表最高爲九十餘度，吾嘗居其地兩夏，今猶念之不已。談者每謂成都夏季情景最與北平相近，實亦不盡然。北平天高無雲，卓午暘光，曝人如炙，且雨量稀少，如延續晴燥若干日，華表即溢百度，成都則溫度平均，無大酷烈，蒸發量低，而多雨，雨後易秋衣，巡行河阪，其情味殆不下於「含鄱口之黄昏」也。</p>
<p>北平人口，多至一百八十萬，成都僅及其什之四而弱，又以經濟之體系異，成都爲足以自給之農城，貧民所占之「百分比」較少；北平則旣非工業城，又非農業城，復不成其爲政治城，極大多數之居民，皆需奔走喘息，爭取當日之生活料於市　。故兩地民情，一躁動而一恬謐，入夏，所表現者尤深刻。北平市上，天愈熱，則賣冰棒小兒之嘶喊聲，愈覺有悲凉味；此成都所無也。吾嘗於成都靜安別墅度過半夏，門外即鬧市，而如住文殊院憎房，有　　愔情之感。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The 19th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 13th, with Sun Ke presiding. After the meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, the first item was the report of previous matters. The minutes of the previous meeting and the administrative Yuan's submission regarding the agreement and exchange of notes between the Chinese and American governments on economic aid were passed without objection and were approved for record. It was also decided that the proposal by Yang Zhonghua and others to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Education to change "National Frontier School" to "National Frontier College" would be referred to the Frontier Affairs and Education &amp; Culture Committees for reference, according to the procedures committee's recommendation. Regarding the proposal by Duanmu Jie and others to grant amnesty to encourage self-renewal, it was also decided, according to the procedures committee's recommendation that, as there were no clear legal provisions on whether the Legislative Yuan could propose amnesty, the matter would be discussed after the Judicial Yuan's interpretation. Subsequently, the Procedures Committee's report on improving the efficiency of meetings and the Education &amp; Culture Committee's report on the review of petitions from subsidized students studying abroad were heard and accepted by the assembly. At 10:15 AM, the discussion of items began, continuing the discussion of the draft Supervisory Law. By noon, each article of the third chapter and subsequent chapters had been revised and passed in the second reading.</p>
<p>The meeting resumed at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, and the draft Supervisory Law was submitted for third reading. After textual amendments were made, it was passed without objection. It was also decided that the three old laws related to the Supervisory Yuan during the period of political tutelage, namely the "Impeachment Law", the "Provisional Measures for Exercising Supervisory Power during Extraordinary Periods", and the "Implementing Rules for the Provisional Measures for Exercising Supervisory Power during Extraordinary Periods", should all be abolished. This point will be stated in the letter accompanying the bill to the President. Then, the report of the Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the review of the postal rate increase was discussed. The committee members held different opinions on whether to increase rates and by how much. After heated debate, a vote was taken, and with the approval of 99 people (out of 192 committee members present), the review opinion was passed, namely to uniformly double the current postal rates, increasing the rate for ordinary letters to 15,000 yuan, with other rates increased accordingly. Subsequently, the Foreign Affairs Committee's report on the study of Qiu Youzhen and others' proposal to form a delegation from the Legislative Yuan to Japan for observation was discussed. After Sun Guiji, the convener of the committee, explained the reasons for the review opinion to retain the proposal, several members expressed their opposition. The result of the vote was that only 20 members (out of 173 members present) opposed, and the review opinion was thus established. In addition, the Education &amp; Culture Committee's report on the review of proposals by Liu Zhen, Long Wenzhi, and others to find ways to solve the employment problem of graduates from colleges and above, and the proposal by Huang Tong and others to negotiate with friendly countries to strictly investigate funds fleeing abroad and ensure they fulfill their tax obligations, were handled according to the procedures committee's recommendations, or were referred for review. The report of the 21-member committee on drafting the organizational rules for the Legislative Yuan's war zone military and civilian condolence delegation, requesting a public decision, and the proposal by Wang Zhaorong and others to request the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to all provincial and municipal governments to effectively protect the personal freedom of the people, and to telegraph the Shanghai Municipal Government to immediately release the students arrested on June 6 to safeguard human rights, were not discussed. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM in the evening.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 13th, it was decided that the proposal by Quan Shao-xian and others to "formulate various methods for freezing issuance, balancing the budget, and restoring the pre-war living standards of public educators, requesting that it be transferred to the Executive Yuan for effective implementation, and be set as the standard for budget review by the Legislative Yuan, requesting a public decision" would be referred to the Finance and Banking Committee for review, in addition to the budget committee's review and attention. The methods related to restoring the pre-war living standards of public educators in the entire proposal are: (1) Starting from July, the salaries of public educators will be fully adjusted based on the cost of living, implemented in phases, with 70% of the total amount adjusted in July, increasing monthly to 100% in October. (2) All agencies will be responsible for thoroughly investigating and registering the family population and economic status of their personnel, and based on this, a mandatory savings system will be determined for a portion of the personnel, with a portion of the adjusted salaries paid in kind or bonds, to be repaid by the state in installments with interest after the suppression of the rebellion is completed. (3) The Legislative Yuan will jointly form a cost of living index review committee with the Supervisory Yuan and the Executive Yuan to strictly implement this. Quan's proposal has attracted the attention of public educators in the capital. When the Legislative Yuan staff met on the 13th, they distributed a letter from all staff to all committee members, expressing their excitement about the proposal and appealing to all committee members for unanimous support to ensure its smooth passage. The letter also included four specific recommendations: (1) Promptly implement the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. (2) The cost of living index should be calculated based on the prices for the current month. (3) The cost of living index should be announced every half month. (4) All staff salaries should be paid in full on the day following the announcement of the index. Most committee members attached great importance to this.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee held a convener's meeting on the morning of the 13th. Because the preliminary review of the general budget by groups revealed that there were many matters pending resolution during the comprehensive review stage, it was decided to change the agenda to ensure that all work could be carried out thoroughly. On the 14th, the plenary session of the Budget Committee will be held according to the original agenda to begin the comprehensive review. The comprehensive review will continue on the 15th, the 16th is a regular meeting day, and on the 17th, a joint meeting of all committees of the Legislative Yuan will be held for the final review. The overall report will be discussed and decided no later than the last regular meeting of the session on the 20th. In addition, the fifth group of the preliminary review subgroup meeting resumed at 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th to continue secretly discussing the budget proposals for which it was responsible for reviewing.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 13th, the Legislative Yuan passed the Education and Culture Committee's report on the proposals by Liu Zhen and others and Long Wenzhi and others to find ways to solve the employment problem of graduates from colleges and above. The review resolved two points: (1) The Legislative Yuan will submit a written inquiry to the Executive Yuan, asking it to take responsibility for resolving the issue promptly. (2) Regarding the fundamental methods for nurturing, employing, and reserving talents at the national level, the Ministry of Education should jointly draft a plan with the relevant competent authorities. The Procedures Committee's opinion was that the content of the report was an inquiry, so it proposed that the Legislative Yuan, in accordance with the provisions of Article 58, Paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure, directly transfer it to the person being questioned by the President, which was accepted by the assembly without objection.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 13th, the review opinions of the Education and Culture Committee on the petitions of translators and subsidized students studying abroad were accepted. It was believed that since the government had made a promise to send them abroad for study, and they had been publicly examined and admitted, foreign exchange should not be delayed, wasting the precious time of the students and damaging the government's credibility. It was decided to submit a written inquiry to the Executive Yuan in the name of the committee members.</p>

After the report items listed on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan meeting were completed, President Sun announced this news, and the assembly responded with enthusiastic applause. It is reported that the remaining eight people will also go to Nanjing to report for duty and attend the meeting within days. As for the five Youth Party legislators, they are currently scattered in various places, and the party has notified them separately that they can also come to Nanjing to report for duty one after another in the short term. In addition, about ten Youth Party candidates who failed to win the election for legislators may serve as special committee members of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our City News] The Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement yesterday (13th) as follows: Since before the election of the National Assembly legislators last year, our colleagues believed that after many years of political tutelage, public elections between minority and majority parties would inevitably lead to unrest among the people. Therefore, there was an agreement on the number of people elected. During the election, whether it was a party recommendation or a local signature, the expected result was not achieved. Although the number of National Assembly representatives did not match the original number, the difference was not too great. As for the number of legislators, the ruling party suddenly changed to the "standard of election based on the number of votes" on the day of announcing the list. Our party's public activities have not been long, and if we focus on the number of people agreed upon, we cannot avoid betraying our party's original intention of promoting constitutional government regardless of its own interests. According to the political parties in Western democratic countries, their first election may get one or three or four seats, and they can attend the meeting in the same way as the majority party. However, because the government's promise on the number of people is not entirely consistent, there has been a delay in the back-and-forth negotiations. Now that the Legislative Yuan has been in session for two months, in addition to the greatest confidence in the government to fulfill its final promise, all legislators elected by our party have decided to attend the meeting from the 13th of this month. According to the established practice of opposition parties in various countries, regardless of the number of members, all attend the meeting, and our party's legislators should fulfill the people's trust and contribute to legislation for the people and supervision of the government, so as to lay the foundation for the beginning of constitutional government. The foundation of democratic politics lies in public opinion. The process of the Legislative Yuan election is known to the world. Now that it is a public law institution, it should fulfill the obligations and responsibilities that both the majority and minority parties should fulfill, and be able to handle itself accordingly. In other words, the majority party is the ruling party, fulfilling its responsibility to preside over national affairs, and the minority party is the opposition party, fulfilling its responsibility to assist and supervise in the meeting. Once this principle is established, both sides will not interfere with each other, and each will be able to fulfill its responsibilities. This statement is made specifically for the attention of the people of the country.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] According to the Xinhua News Agency's English broadcast from northern Shaanxi on the 12th, "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has resolved to endorse the resolution of the Communist International Intelligence Bureau Congress on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia" (see the third edition of yesterday's newspaper). A certain authoritative observer here believes that this is another resolution of the Chinese Communist Party appearing as an echo of the Communist International and a follower of the Soviet Union. It also criticized speculators, the so-called "middle road line" people. It is said that based on the content of the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it can be seen that the Chinese Communist Party is following the Communist International and the Soviet Union step by step, and there is virtually no objection. However, there are still some speculators and reactionary groups who dream of holding a so-called "new political consultative conference" with the Communist Party and establishing a so-called "coalition government." They do not know that, in the Communist Party's view, they have long regarded them as the bourgeois class of counter-revolutionaries.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Supervisory Yuan is scheduled to hold its eighteenth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th to exercise its right of consent to the candidates for Grand Justice nominated by the President. In accordance with the Supervisory Yuan's consent right exercise method, the full committee review meeting was first held on the 13th to review the candidates for Grand Justice and Examination Committee members nominated by the President. The meeting was conducted in secret. Liu Pingjiang chaired the morning session, and Mao Yiheng chaired the afternoon session. In the morning session, opinions were widely expressed, and it was decided that the principle was that each province should have one Grand Justice or Examination Committee member. When sending the results of the vote to the President, it was requested that attention be paid to the regional distribution of candidates and personnel from the Mongolian and Tibetan regions when making supplementary nominations. When re-nominating candidates, those who have already been nominated do not need to be nominated again. In the afternoon, the list of Grand Justices was individually reviewed. It was reported that there were many opinions from the committee members. However, by the time the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, fifteen of the seventeen people had been agreed upon. It seems that two of them were not supported by some people, but it will not be determined until the consent right vote is exercised on the 14th.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Among the various efforts of the government to stabilize the current economic situation from many aspects, close attention has recently been paid to the adverse impact of Hong Kong on China's economic situation. The diplomatic and related authorities have discussed countermeasures and plan to negotiate with the Hong Kong government to eliminate this factor that is causing China's economic situation to deteriorate. According to a certain authoritative person who spoke to reporters on the afternoon of the 13th, since the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement was signed on January 15, the trade part of the agreement has not been implemented by the Hong Kong government because the Hong Kong Council refused to approve it. Although the financial part of the agreement has been approved and implemented, the Hong Kong government is not serious in its implementation, so it has not had a real effect. The Sino-Hong Kong agreement originally stipulated that it should be implemented within one month after signing. The trade agreement has been delayed until now, and the Chinese government has urged it repeatedly, but the Hong Kong side has not given a concrete reply. Therefore, even if the Chinese government makes efforts to stabilize the economy in many ways in the future, if the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement cannot be implemented, the factors of smuggling and disrupting the financial market will still exist, and the economic situation will still be adversely affected. The authoritative person also said: According to what he knows, the Chinese government has paid close attention to this, and will discuss with the Hong Kong side in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Several Issues in Handling Agricultural Loans <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Since the Fourth Session, deeply concerned in mid-March, decided to restore agricultural loans, it has been more than four months; all parties in the country attach great importance to the implementation of this work, all believing that if this issue can be handled properly, it will be beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; otherwise, it will only deepen the concentration of rural wealth, fuel the rise in prices, and not be slightly ignored. Now, we put forward several practical issues concerning the handling of agricultural loans to arouse the attention of the authorities and for the research of the people.</p>
<p>The first is the issue of the amount of agricultural loans. At present, the agricultural loan of 200,000 yuan per mu is less than one-thirtieth of the actual needs of the morning people. Regarding food production loans, the loan amount per mu is only stipulated to be 200,000 to 300,000 yuan; at present, a single soybean cake requires seven to eight million yuan; and each mu requires at least one soybean cake to be used as fertilizer, which is really a drop in the bucket, what good is it! Moreover, recently, the average loan amount per mu of food loans in various places is only more than 100,000 yuan, which is only one-thirtieth of the actual needs. May I ask, how can this kind of agricultural loan, which is famous but not real, reduce the economic difficulties of farmers? And the main purpose of agricultural loans is to increase food production, so how can we expect it to be effective with such a small amount? Therefore, most farmers are not very interested in agricultural loans, and there are quite a few who even voluntarily give up.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of the timing of issuing agricultural loans. In terms of the time of agricultural work, food loans must be issued in early July to be effective. Because in early July, it is the most difficult time for farmers when they are in between harvests; in terms of farming, most of the fields have been planted at that time. According to farmers, fertilizing after mid-July is too late; and agricultural loan institutions in various places mostly issue food loans in kind, and ordering, delivering, and transporting goods all require a considerable amount of time. Therefore, this summer, food loans must be allocated to various places before the beginning of July and ordered quickly to be effective. However, some food loans in various places have only allocated about half of the quota, and although the loan procedures have been completed, the funds have not yet been allocated; if this continues to be delayed, it is very likely that the time for fertilizing rice fields will be missed, affecting this year's autumn harvest. Who should be responsible for this? It is self-evident.</p>
<p>The third is the issue of individual food loans to farmers. Recently, in terms of agricultural loans, most of the loans are individually loaned to farmers for farmers to operate and manage themselves; taking the area along the Jinghu line as an example, individual loans to farmers account for more than 90%. However, the amount of individual loans is limited, and the effect that occurs cannot be great; it is even more difficult to see the specific results of loans for farmers' scattered operations. Members and cooperatives only have a relationship of borrowing and repaying loans, and the opportunity to contact cooperative organizations is still not much, and the understanding of cooperation is even shallower; moreover, at present, there are not many cases where various townships, towns, and baos raise funds by themselves. These loan associations only collect a small amount of interest, and some cooperatives are not even enough to open, and there is little contribution to increasing the public property of the association. In the event of disasters or other accidents, the recovery of loans is also a problem. Therefore, we advocate that agricultural loan institutions in various places should strictly supervise branches in various places in the future, actively encourage various communities to engage in collective management business, among which, agricultural product processing machinery, new agricultural tools, and rural sideline equipment are especially important. The results of this loan are easy to see, and the profit situation of the cooperative is also more obvious.</p>
<p>The fourth is the issue of the way agricultural loans are handled. We believe that human and financial resources should be concentrated to avoid the dispersion of funds. At present, agricultural loans in various places are almost completely passive. Local gentry and various agencies mostly advocate average distribution by township, town, and bao, regardless of whether the organization is sound or not, regardless of the public security situation, loans must be issued. However, cooperative business is not a charitable business, and agricultural loans are not relief funds. This loan has its own special mission and necessary conditions. If it fits, it is loaned, if it does not fit, it is not loaned. Therefore, in some places now, the eastern township applies for loans to the eastern township, and the western township applies for loans to the western township, with no overall plan in advance, so that limited funds are scattered in various places, supervision is not convenient, and malpractices are very likely to occur. We believe that after the quotas are determined, agricultural loan institutions in various places should select several areas according to the conditions of the main crop producing areas in the area: whether the cooperative business is developed? Is the transportation convenient? Is the public security good? Are there many poor farmers? And other conditions, formulate a practical and feasible phased implementation plan, concentrate human and financial resources, strive to take the initiative everywhere, and gradually implement it according to the plan. Loan methods should be as collective management as possible, and it will be possible to establish a considerable foundation for local cooperative business and give full play to the results of cooperation!</p>
<p>The fifth is to change the style of helping a few people get rich. It is undeniable that in the past, most agricultural associations and cooperative organizations at all levels, except for a small number of sound ones, were manipulated by local tyrants. Therefore, in the distribution of agricultural goods, with a little carelessness and lax supervision, this small number of writing staff will arbitrarily transfer the use of loans for their own benefit and practice corruption. Most farmers did not benefit from it, but were used by a small number of people. Therefore, we believe that in places where agricultural loans are handled, if this phenomenon is found, the local administrative agency must be strictly punished, killing one to warn a hundred, so as not to allow this trend to spread to an unmanageable level. According to our investigation, most of these groups do not announce their accounts, meetings are not held regularly, they arbitrarily manipulate business, and spend money at will. If agricultural loans are loaned to these groups, they will only help a few people get rich and indirectly promote the concentration of rural wealth. Therefore, we require the authorities to pay special attention to poor farmers and middle peasants when handling agricultural loans in the future, and must ensure that loans can be sent to those who are in real and urgent need, and must never allow a small number of people to use agricultural loans as capital for personal enrichment.</p>
<p>In short, after eight years of resistance against the war, our country's rural areas were devastated by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the communist bandits' rebellion followed one after another, and the rural areas were poisoned by the communist bandits, resulting in a thousand holes and a hundred sores, broken to an indescribable degree. The rural economy is collapsing there, and the hard-working farmers are no different from being in deep water and fire, and the government's relief is very urgent. This situation is also recognized by the government authorities. The annual agricultural loans are nothing more than to relieve farmers' economic difficulties and assist them in applying a little more fertilizer to increase food production. Although the situation of handling agricultural loans in the past two or three years has not been as ideal as we would like, we must not "give up eating because of choking." We not only require the government to continue handling agricultural loans, but also hope that the organizers of agricultural loans will improve at any time so that agricultural loans can truly have their effect. Not only should it reduce the economic difficulties of farmers, but it should also achieve the purpose of increasing food production.</p>

<p>North China Bandits Suppression Headquarters Announces</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 13th] The spokesman of the North China Bandits Suppression Headquarters announced on the 12th: Commander-in-Chief Fu was extremely saddened by the "July 5th" unfortunate incident that occurred in Peiping this time. He was deeply grateful for the concern, assistance and opinions provided by people from all walks of life. Regarding the aftermath, the headquarters has instructed relevant agencies to handle it quickly and carefully: (1) For the resettlement of students from the Northeast who came to Peiping, in addition to Lin Da and Lin Zhong, which are accommodated as much as possible, temporary tutorial classes will be set up, and students from private schools in the Northeast can register their student status and make up for the curriculum, so that they can transfer to Lin Da and Lin Zhong separately when the school starts. In addition to the funds allocated by the Department of Education, the Headquarters will first advance 10 billion yuan. This matter will be handled by the Municipal Government assisting Vice Minister Tian of the Ministry of Education to invite the persons in charge of universities and colleges in the Northeast to discuss. In addition to the current occupied school land and class land, the troops and supply agencies will borrow the Huang Temple in Peiping and the racecourse in Tianjin with complete equipment that can accommodate 5,000 people (formerly the Japanese Yamato School), etc., which can first accommodate all the students from the Northeast. As for the allocation of houses, each university and college will discuss and handle it, and it will be done as soon as possible within five days so that students have a room to live in, food to eat, and books to read in the shortest period of time. (2) The Municipal Government will assist relevant parties in allocating funds to repair the destroyed Municipal Council House, and handle the burial and consolation of the dead, and the treatment and condolences of the injured? (3) Investigate the Dongjiaominxiang unfortunate incident and the actual situation of the shooting, severely punish the perpetrators, and the initial instigators who destroyed the Municipal Council will also be investigated.

<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 13th] A shocking incident occurred in Baoding. Students from the private Sizcun Middle School and Social Education Normal School, organized by Zhang Yinwu, wanted to demolish the school site because Baoding was strengthening city defense works. In addition, the County Government recently sealed the three cooperatives run by the school, and on the 12th, they gathered a crowd to destroy the residence of Wang Wenquan, the Speaker of the Qingyuan (Baoding) Senate, and beat and injured the Speaker Wang Wenquan and his wife. Yesterday morning at 5:30, when the curfew in Baoding was lifted and the city gates had just opened, 100 students from the two schools entered the city from Caokun Park in the South Gate to the Southwest Gate to reach Wang Wenquan's residence at An 27, the former site of the Shi family. Along the way, they posted slogans and shouted slogans such as "Down with the standard local tyrant Wang Wenquan who rapes public opinion" and "Down with Qingyuan County Chief Liu Liyuan." After arriving at Wang's residence, the crowd rushed in, and without saying a word, they beat Speaker Wang to the ground. Bricks, tiles, wooden sticks fell together, and he suffered a serious head injury and immediately passed out. His wife, Liu, who was the only one at home, was also severely beaten. The doors, windows, furniture, lights and telephones were completely destroyed, and then they returned to school. Speaker Wang and his wife were sent to the hospital and are no longer in danger. After the case occurred, in addition to explaining the facts to all sectors, the Senate also sent a letter to the local military, government and police agencies, saying that the Sizcun Middle School had recently sheltered the three flower shops of merchants Deji, Minfeng, and Yongxin, falsely using the name of the Sizcun Cooperative to collect flowers and draw commissions, infringing on local tax revenue, and the Qingyuan County Government had sealed them up for investigation, and both parties had filed a lawsuit. In addition, the stationed troops strengthened city defense works and set a time limit to demolish the houses within the moat that obstructed the line of fire, and Caokun Park, which was occupied by the Sizcun Middle School, could not be an exception. In the above two points, the rights and wrongs are self-evident. The Senate only bears the responsibility for suggesting and part of the responsibility for the above two measures, but Principal Zhang Yinwu was angry with the Senate, which led to this unfortunate incident. The Senate also made three requests: (1) Severely punish the perpetrators, (2) Investigate the principals behind the scenes, (3) Compensate Speaker Wang for his personal losses. The military and political leaders jointly received reporters and said that they were determined to prevent the expansion of the situation and avoid similar incidents. Sizcun students were also prohibited from entering the city on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 13th] Baoding is strengthening city defense works and demolishing obstacles in the moat. Ordinary people have lost their homes and have no houses to live in.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce News: Private trade with Japan has gradually started. In the early stage of this Sino-Japanese trade, in order to enable merchants to earnestly fulfill contracts and establish foreign credit, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has recently approved "Six Points for Reviewing the Observations of Merchants Trading with Japan", which have been distributed for implementation. The above-mentioned precautions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When a merchant applies to change the trade plan, the categories of imports and exports to be added or changed must be within the scope of the government-approved list of goods imported and exported to Japan in that year. (2) When a merchant applies to change the trade plan, if the categories of imports and exports to Japan are not limited in quantity in the list of goods imported and exported to Japan, the commercial commissioner may approve and report it for verification; if the categories are limited in quantity, the Ministry must be consulted for approval in advance. (3) When a merchant applies to add or change the categories of imports and exports, if the quantity or value exceeds the original plan, the commercial commissioner should first telegraph the Ministry for approval. (4) For the categories listed with a limited amount in the original plan, if both parties agree to give each other, and the total amount after the concession does not exceed the sum of the original amount of both parties, and does not affect the interests of third parties, the commercial commissioner may approve it and report it to the Ministry for verification. (5) When a merchant exports goods in accordance with the approved plan, if the total selling price stipulated in each contract is less than 50,000 US dollars, the commercial commissioner may review and approve it to the head of the representative group in Japan before signing the contract. If it exceeds 50,000 US dollars, the situation of the existing goods preparation must be checked before approving it; as for the amount of the contract that has been signed but not fulfilled, it should be calculated together when renewing the contract. If the newly signed contract and the contract of the original unfulfilled part total more than 50,000 US dollars, the situation of the existing goods must be checked before handling it. (6) The commercial commissioner should directly telegraph the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Guidance Office for the responsible investigation and reply for contracts exceeding 50,000 US dollars. If the preparation of existing goods for the exceeded part is more than 60%, the merchant should be allowed to sign the contract according to the number. If it is less than 60%, the Ministry should be consulted in advance for instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Bernadotte Recommends to the Security Council Armed Intervention in the Holy Land Conflict and Requests the Issuance of an Emergency Ceasefire Order <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 13th Broadcast: UN Mediator Bernadotte, at an emergency meeting of the Security Council today, requested that the Security Council resolutely intervene in the Palestine war and declare its determination to take various steps to stop the war. Bernadotte urged the Security Council to issue a ceasefire order immediately, and those who violate the order will be sanctioned. He stated that if such an order could be issued, there would be another period of truce between the Arabs and Jews.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th dispatch] Bernadotte submitted a report to the Security Council, stating in the strongest terms that the expansion of the Palestine conflict would cause a world war and that only armed intervention by the United Nations could stop the dramatic changes in the Holy Land. Bernadotte pointed out that his mediation mission was stalled due to three major factors: partition, the State of Israel, and immigration. He also solemnly stated that time is running out, and if the Jews and Arabs continue to adhere to their positions, the war will expand. He suggested that the Security Council immediately send armed forces to the Holy Land, otherwise the raging tide of war will engulf parts of the world, not just the Jews and Arabs. Regarding the situation in the Holy Land during the truce, Bernadotte said that neither the Jewish side nor the Arab side had gained any military advantage due to the truce. On the whole, his truce monitoring team was very satisfied because the frontline commanders of both sides were generally able to abide by the ceasefire order. Bernadotte admitted that in the current situation where the opinions of the warring parties are vastly different, he still does not know how a compromise can be reached, but he intends to use every diplomatic method to restore reason to the Jews and Arabs. If it is unsuccessful, the Security Council will take action. Bernadotte did not specify how many troops the United Nations needs to send to solve the problem, nor did he specify how this international army would be organized or whether it would include Soviet troops. These details will be decided by the Security Council. British representative to the Security Council, Cadogan, asked Bernadotte whether he was still optimistic. Bernadotte did not indicate whether he was, but said: "This depends on the Security Council's ability to deal with this emergency situation."</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 13th dispatch] The report of the United Nations Palestine War Mediator Bernadotte to the United Nations Security Council was distributed to the representatives of the member states last night. Bernadotte's report concluded that an immediate ceasefire in the Holy Land is only the first step. "The problem that must be solved now is whether the world is willing to allow force to be the method of solving the Palestine problem. If so, the peace of the entire Near East and a larger area will be in great danger."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th dispatch] United Nations Palestine War Mediator Bernadotte personally urged Britain and the United States tonight to strongly urge the Security Council to pass a resolution to deal with the situation in Palestine. US representative Jessup and British representative Cadogan both agreed to take concerted action to promote a ceasefire, but the details of their proposals have yet to be adjusted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th dispatch] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to discuss the situation in Palestine. Mediator Bernadotte first met with UN Secretary-General Lie and Security Council President, Ukrainian representative Manuilsky. Shortly afterwards, US representative Jessup and British representative Cadogan were also invited to the meeting. Bernadotte then told reporters that he had drafted a 21-page report describing the negotiations with the Arab and Jewish sides, and the Security Council meeting tomorrow will use this as a basis for discussion. Bernadotte also said that both the Arab and Jewish sides have asked me to continue to mediate. If I thought reconciliation was hopeless, I would have given up long ago. I will return to Rhodes Island on Friday to continue mediating. In short, I hope to restart the ceasefire on the one hand and negotiate a permanent solution on the other.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Arab League Military Steadily Losing Ground: May Accept Another Ceasefire. Emergency Meeting Being Held in Lebanon. <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th dispatch] The war after the end of the Holy Land ceasefire order seems to have been dominated by the Jewish army. The Arab League Political Committee held an emergency meeting today in a mountain area in Lebanon. After the Jewish army occupied the important towns of Lydda and Ramle, the Israeli army's bulletin today said: "The Jewish army has advanced 15 miles east along the Har Aviv-Jerusalem highway from Ramle."</p>
<p>The bulletin from Tel Aviv stated: "According to frontline reports, the Arab army on the northern front has completely collapsed, and the Jewish army is pursuing the fleeing Syrian army. The vanguard has entered Syrian territory." The situation in the Holy Land has affected the cotton and stock markets in Cairo. The market opened weak this morning, and there was no improvement even after the news of Egyptian aircraft bombing Tel Aviv. Observers, after pointing out the hesitation of the Arabs in both military and political aspects, said that they believe that the emergency meeting in Lebanon may decide that if the Security Council formally proposes an extension of the ceasefire after listening to Bernadotte's report, it will be accepted. An Israeli bulletin reported the battle situation on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway, saying that the Jewish army had completely controlled the section of the road from May Tai Er to Latron. It also said that the Jewish army is preparing to attack the Arab stronghold of Latron and open the route to Jerusalem. A Jewish frontline report also said that the Jewish army fought fiercely with the Egyptian army 27 miles south of Tel Aviv overnight, completely defeating the Egyptian army. A Cairo report stated that the Egyptian Air Force was very active. Egyptian bombers attacked the Jewish army front line west of Jerusalem, and Spitfire aircraft attacked the Aqir airfield 8 miles southwest of Tel Aviv and Lydda.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Panama City, 12th Associated Press dispatch] The Parliament of Panama recently resolved to remove President Jiménez by a vote of one vote and elected Barrio as President for a term of four years, with Sucley as First Vice President and Marules as Second Vice President. Barrio will take office on August 1. During the transition period, Panama will be managed by the parliament's leadership. The parliamentary resolution declared that Jiménez had failed to ensure the country's stability and that the recent unrest and political struggles had caused "the people of Panama to suffer more."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] The Panamanian Ambassador to the United States, Fan Larina, issued a statement saying that the Panamanian Parliament's dismissal of President Jiménez was an unusual and illegal move. Fan continued, "There have been no new disturbances in Panama, and the country is absolutely peaceful."</p>
<h3 id="e48">US Democratic Party Convention Begins Voting Today to Elect Presidential Candidate; Pepper is Truman's Only Opponent <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Philadelphia, 12th dispatch] The Democratic National Convention opened today to select the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates in the November election and to formulate the 1948 party platform on domestic and international issues. It is generally believed that President Truman will be nominated as the presidential candidate, serving a full four years in the White House, but one of the major issues is who will be elected as the vice-presidential candidate. The delegates will begin voting on Wednesday to elect the presidential candidate. To win the nomination, at least 618 votes are needed.</p>
<p>In the presidential nomination, Truman's only opponent is Florida Senator Pepper, who suddenly entered the race on Wuqi Day. Pepper admitted that he could not get more than six and a half of the 20 votes in his hometown of Florida.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 13th dispatch] Senator Barkley's nomination as the vice-presidential candidate was almost a certainty on the 13th. However, President Truman seems to lack enthusiasm for Barkley because he believes that having a person from neighboring Kentucky, Missouri, run at the same time as him is a disadvantage in political strategy. However, after listening to Barkley's opening speech to the conference as the temporary chairman, the delegates expressed great support for this 70-year-old senator, and their enthusiasm far exceeded that for Truman.</p>

<p>Foreign Policy Platform May Have No Major Disputes</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 12th dispatch] The Democratic Party's 1948 presidential campaign platform is almost completely passed except for the civil rights program. Due to the deadlock on the civil rights issue, the rift between the party's Southern conservatives and Northern liberals is likely to widen. This civil rights issue, in essence, is the black issue. The two factions have fought repeatedly for this. Senator Myers, the chairman of the proposal committee responsible for drafting the Democratic platform, told reporters: "There is no dispute over the foreign policy network, and the domestic policy program will largely follow the New Deal policy, which is why it represents the plans in the minds of Roosevelt and Truman." Myers said: "The platform has included the important proposals Truman has made to Congress." Myers believes that the detailed content of the platform is a secret that should be kept, but he claims that the Democratic Party's platform will be more detailed and specific than the Republican Party's. The issues of aid to China and the extension of the Sino-US Reciprocal Trade Agreement, which are disputes between the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress, still depend on whether the Democratic platform will refute the accusations of Republican candidate Dewey, saying that the US government's attitude towards China is stingy, and whether it will accuse the Republican congressmen of "hindering" the reciprocal trade agreement plan.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, New York, 12th dispatch] The National Tuberculosis Association held its annual meeting here today, and a paper was read on the spot to prove that the latest treatment for tuberculosis is to use a new-style iron lung to allow it to get complete rest. This rest is an important step in the recovery of tuberculosis. The iron lung is a round, long steel tube with plastic windows that allow a person to freely enter, lie down, talk, read, and breathe as usual. The patient's lungs do not expand or contract, but if a button is pressed, the movement of the lungs and muscles can be stopped completely.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th dispatch] The most tense stage of the Berlin crisis has begun with the return of the British and Soviet Commanders-in-Chief to Berlin from London and Moscow with new instructions. British Commander-in-Chief Robertson stayed in London for two days and visited Foreign Secretary Bevin, Minister of Defense Alexander, Chief of the External Affairs Office Styphen, and Chiefs of Staff, respectively. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky met with Stalin and Molotov in Moscow for four days.</p>
<p>After Robertson arrived in Berlin, he revealed that he had requested reinforcements from the government during his trip to London, and British Air Force Minister Huntenson, who was investigating the state of the British airlift in Berlin, revealed for the first time that the British and American Dakota aircraft that were responsible for the airlift between West Germany and Berlin were armed aircraft. He also said that the Soviet side will cause shooting incidents in order to obstruct the airlift. Earlier, the old military government issued a statement this morning, saying that the Soviet aviation authorities could no longer tolerate the repeated violations of Berlin aviation regulations by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th dispatch] A spokesman for the British War Office solemnly denied that Britain has decided to increase its troops in Berlin or the British-occupied area of Germany. Political figures here believe that the increase in troops must be approved by the cabinet.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Communist International Information Bureau Issues Statement Condemning Yugoslavia (Continued) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(7) In order to be concerned about the situation within the Yugoslav Communist Party (CPY) and to enable the CPY leaders to find a way out of this situation, the Central Committees of the Soviet Communist Party and other fraternal parties decided to discuss the internal situation of the CPY at a meeting of the Communist Information Bureau. This discussion was based on formal principles, as the activities of other countries' communist parties had also been reviewed at the first meeting of the Communist Information Bureau. Despite various suggestions from fraternal parties to discuss the CPY's situation in the Communist Information Bureau, the Yugoslav leaders' response was a refusal. They refused to attend the Communist Information Bureau meeting under the pretext of "not having equal rights," in order to avoid legitimate criticism from fraternal parties.</p>
<p>However, it must be stated that this statement by the Yugoslav leaders is completely false, because everyone knows that when the communist parties of various countries organized the Communist Information Bureau, they established an indisputable principle: that each party must report its activities to the Communist Information Bureau, and each party has the right to criticize other parties. At the first meeting convened by the communist parties of nine countries, the CPY extensively exercised this right. Yugoslavia's refusal to settle its activities before the Communist Information Bureau indicates that the country violated the principle of equal rights for communist parties of all countries, which is tantamount to Yugoslavia demanding a privileged position in the Communist Information Bureau.</p>
<p>(8) In view of the above, the Communist Information Bureau agreed to re-evaluate the CPY's situation, to criticize the CPY Central Committee's erroneous actions, and to agree with the political analysis of the CPY's erroneous actions described in the letters sent by the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee to the CPY Central Committee from March to May this year. The Communist Information Bureau has reached a unanimous conclusion that due to the CPY leaders' opposition to the party, opposition to the Soviet Union, violation of Marxism-Leninism, and refusal to participate in the Communist International Information Bureau, they have placed themselves in the ranks of opposition to the CPY. They have deviated from the socialist united front against imperialism, embarked on a path of betraying the international solidarity of the working masses, and embarked on a transitional path toward national egoism.</p>
<p>The Communist Information Bureau believes that the above results prove that the CPY Central Committee is willing to separate itself and the entire communist party from the international communist family, from the communist united front, that is, from the ranks of the Communist Information Bureau. The Communist Information Bureau believes that all the mistakes made by the CPY leaders are based on an indisputable fact: that in the last five to six months under the leadership of the party, nationalists have been openly active and unscrupulous. The CPY leaders have moved far away from the party's international line tradition and embarked on the path of nationalism. The Yugoslav leaders have taken a wrong direction in the international situation and are panic-stricken by the threat of imperialism. They believe that if they continue to make concessions to imperialist countries, they will be able to obtain grace, conclude agreements with imperialist countries regarding Yugoslavia's independence, and gradually influence the Yugoslav people to take the path taken by imperialist countries, that is, the capitalist path.</p>
<p>At the same time, they tacitly adopted the bourgeois-nationalist argument that capitalism is less harmful to Yugoslavia's independence than the Soviet Union. The Yugoslav leaders do not know, or at least pretend not to know, that similar nationalist consciousness will lead Yugoslavia onto the path of a typical bourgeois republic and cause the country to lose its national independence in the face of imperialists. The Communist Information Bureau does not doubt that in the center of the CPY, there are sufficiently sound elements who are truly loyal to Marxism-Leninism, who are loyal to the CPY's international line tradition, and who are loyal to the socialist united front.</p>
<p>These sound elements of the CPY have a purpose: they will force their current party leaders to openly and faithfully admit the mistakes they have made and correct them, while separating from nationalism and arranging various methods to resist the socialist united front of imperialism. Or, if it proves that the current leaders of the CPY are unable to undertake this work, then sound elements will rise up and take their place, rising from the lower levels to build the leadership of the CPY's new international line. The Communist Information Bureau has no doubt that the Yugoslav Communist Party can accomplish this task.</p>

The results, as passed by the general assembly, are as follows: (1) Mayor's proposal: The quota for the first and second conscription periods in this city is 10,000, with a proposed allocation of 6,000 to the garrison brigade. Resolution: The city's volunteers, currently being recruited by the New Recruit Conscription Office of the Civil Affairs Bureau, will be temporarily halted after recruiting 3,000 volunteers due to funding constraints. The lottery conscription system will be implemented immediately, drafting 6,000 individuals, who will be uniformly assigned to the garrison brigade to ensure local public safety in this city. The city government, the council, the conscription association, the general labor union, and other relevant agencies and organizations will jointly guarantee that those conscripted will be permanently stationed in this city, responsible for defense work, and will absolutely guarantee that they will not be transferred to other locations for expeditions. However, those volunteers joining the National Defense Force will still be approved. Therefore, a large-scale publicity campaign will be launched to enable eligible young citizens in this city to understand the greater good and actively participate in the work of safeguarding local security in this city. The preferential treatment measures will be determined by the Civil Affairs Bureau, which will convene a "Conscription Task Force Study Group" within days, including the Conscription Association, the General Labor Union, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the Farmers' Association, and other relevant organizations, to study and decide on a plan. (2) When to commence the application review work for the 37th year? Resolution: Commence on August 1st. (3) Should the order prohibiting young men from moving out before the end of June remain in effect? Resolution: Remain in effect. The general assembly adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<p>The second batch of Japanese reparations supplies, totaling a relatively small amount of over 15,000 tons, of which 3,000 tons have already been shipped to Shanghai, with the transportation of the remaining 12,000 tons again reaching an impasse. The reason is that the freight rates for transporting Japanese reparations supplies were too low for the private shipping companies in this city, and their request for adjustment has not yielded satisfactory results. Therefore, at present, all private shipping companies are uniformly refusing to transport Japanese reparations supplies. Currently, only the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is solely responsible for transportation, and it is expected that the completion date for transporting the second batch of Japanese reparations supplies will be delayed by about two weeks. Furthermore, the quantity and types of materials in the third batch of Japanese reparations supplies have not yet been approved by the Allied Headquarters, so the date for commencing their transportation to China is also difficult to determine.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The long-brewing postal and telecommunications price increase has not been approved by the Legislative Yuan, and the finances of the postal and telecommunications bureaus in this city are in extreme difficulty. It is rumored that the Telecommunications Bureau is unable to cope with the payroll period of the 16th of this month and applied for a loan of 200 billion yuan from the Bank of Communications, but the Bank of Communications only approved half. Director Yu has been running around trying to find a solution for this matter. The Postal Bureau has always been a loss-making institution, and in today's era of constantly rising prices, its economic hardship can be imagined. According to a spokesman for the bureau: before the war, the postage for a regular letter was five cents, equivalent to five large pancakes or two newspapers, while today, each large pancake costs 30,000 yuan (yesterday's price), which is a far cry from the 5,000 yuan postage for a regular letter. The application to increase postage to 20,000 yuan per regular letter months ago has not been quickly approved by the Legislative Yuan, and with the current high rate of price increases, 5,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan are only fifty steps and a hundred steps apart, he said with great emotion.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's pricing and allocation of Japanese reparations machines, in addition to the 1,602 units whose parts have been repaired and for which the review and allocation of manufacturers has been completed, pending approval by the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee before contracts can be signed, there are also 300 machine tools whose parts are missing. Originally, it was intended to postpone acceptance, but since they have already arrived in Shanghai, it has been decided to allocate them for the second batch of distribution, with the 320 manufacturers who submitted compliant applications to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce before the April 15th deadline as the distribution targets. The distribution time will begin after the first batch is completed.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Supply Bureau previously entrusted 20 retailers in this city to distribute a large number of surplus materials. Due to the limited distribution quantities stipulated by each retailer and the recent severe inflation, most of the materials flowed into the black market, especially the cold drinks such as ice cream powder and lemon powder that are urgently needed in summer. "Scalpers" selling at stalls are everywhere on Albert Road, Tongfu Road, Haining Road, and Yu Qiaqing Road, and their black market prices are often more than double the distribution prices. Citizens who go to the designated retailers to buy them line up early in the morning, but in a short time, they mostly claim that they are sold out, which further creates the phenomenon of "scalpers" holding onto the goods and not selling them, and the black market prices rising step by step. At a time when the government is trying to suppress prices and determined to sell off supplies, the general public hopes that the Supply Bureau can quickly improve the allocation methods and strictly manage or restrict the retailers.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 13th] The Ministry of Food previously received a telegram from the Mayor of Shanghai requesting a thorough investigation into the hoarding of rice in Wuxi. In addition to telegraphing the Wuxi County Government to conduct a thorough investigation, it also sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi for an on-site investigation. It is learned that the Wuxi County Government has submitted the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Food, stating that the current reserves are not large, and due to recent high demand and brisk sales, half of the reserves have been depleted in several days. According to the situation before the war, the reserves in Wuxi were around 3,000,000 shi, which is far from the current reserves. Furthermore, the Mayor of Shanghai telegraphed Premier Weng requesting a thorough investigation into the hoarding of large quantities of grain in Wuxi under the guise of tax grain. It is learned that the amount of tax grain purchased and stored in Wuxi by various counties is only 70,000 to 80,000 dan. Due to the lack of grain for price stabilization sales, it is also planned to add a commission for price stabilization sales. Furthermore, the price of goods in Wuxi City continues to rise amid the investigation, and the market still lacks opening. White japonica rice is sold for 30,000,000 yuan, Yangxian rice for 29,500,000 yuan, Buxian rice for 29,000,000 yuan, wheat for 20,500,000 yuan, and soybean oil for 65,000,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A fire broke out at the Mei Hua Celluloid Factory at No. 200, Lane 296, Changning Road, West Shanghai, at 10:10 AM yesterday, resulting in as many as fifteen casualties. The Mei Hua Celluloid Factory is located on the outer layer of the premises, and the inner section of the house is rented to the Shanghai Machine-Made Button Factory. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out in the Mei Hua Factory. The raw materials stored were all flammable materials such as waste film, collodion, and alcohol. Therefore, once ignited, the flames soared into the sky, becoming a prairie fire. In an instant, it affected the warehouses of the Shanghai Button Factory, etc. A total of more than ten houses were burned down, including the entire warehouse, two machine rooms, two drying rooms, a building behind the Zhongxing Wood Company, the floors of the buildings at No. 232 where the Jin He Shang lived, No. 234, the Qinglong Noodle Cooking Factory at No. 244, the Bean Sprout Workshop at No. 242, and a resident at No. 240. The Shanghai Button Factory had more than 40 tons of raw materials "tree fruit" and 15 barrels of film, which were also all destroyed.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau was led by Sub-Bureau Chief Shao and Section Chiefs Lu Xui Rui and Shi Jairen, officers Zhu Yingzhang and plainclothes police to maintain order on the scene. At the same time, fire brigades from Jing'an Temple, Huashan Road, and Yichang Road districts drove to the scene, and vehicles from private Zhenru and Caojiadu fire brigades also dispatched one after another. Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Chief of Staff of the General Team Ye Binyong, personally arrived on the scene to direct operations, until the fire was brought under control at 11:00 AM and extinguished by noon. Afterwards, the police officers took the arsonist, Wang, to the sub-bureau for interrogation. It is learned that the cause of the fire was a damaged motor in the sawing room, sparks flying out and landing on a pile of raw materials, resulting in a major disaster.</p>
<p>When the fire broke out, some workers from both factories could not escape and were buried in the fire, including: Su Zhongliang (plasterer, 22 years old, from Suzhou), Ye Yihai (22 years old, from Xuzhou). The injured included Shen Chengkang (34 years old, burns to hands, back, and feet), Yao Awu (female worker, 42 years old, injuries to back and left arm), Wang Lanzhen (female worker, 14 years old, injured left leg), Wang Xiaomei (female worker, 50 years old, injuries to hands and feet), Lai Qifu (male worker, 26 years old, injured right arm), Cheng Hengcai (25 years old, injured right arm), Zhang Yunan (23 years old, injured back), Chen Modao (26 years old, injured neck), Lu Binfu (injured neck and right palm), Zong Baoqing (injured north arm), Li Binghe (19 years old, injuries to hands and back), Ju Yuanxing (18 years old, injured head and face, in critical condition), Gu Xiangjuan (45 years old, injuries to left and right elbows), and 13 others.

<h3 id="e75">The Two Banks' Staff and Workers Employ a Hunger Strike, Proposing Adjustments to Their Remuneration and Continuing to Work While Awaiting a Resolution. <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Approximately 600 employees of the Siming Bank Shanghai Branch at 240 Beijing Road, its five sub-branches at Nanjing Road, Lin Sen Central Road, Hongkou, Carter Road, and Minguo Road, and the bank's warehouses have initiated a hunger strike as of yesterday. In the afternoon, reporters visited and observed that the employees continued to work as usual, but did not eat lunch. According to bank employees, "Colleagues collectively signed a request to the bank for a reasonable minimum living wage. The bank has yet to provide a formal response, only stating that it has been submitted to a board of directors meeting without a scheduled date. Colleagues are enduring skyrocketing prices, with rice already costing over 30 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), making each day feel like a year, and we can no longer wait. Moreover, we understand that other banks' minimum wages for clerks in July, for example, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank has already exceeded 100 million yuan, the 'Four Banks and Two Bureaus', the Central Industrial Bank, and the National Products Bank are above 90 million yuan, and the 'Four Banks and One Association', the China Trust Bank, are above 80 million yuan. Looking back at what our colleagues received in June, only 22.2 million, which, based on the June cost of living index of 560,000 times, means our base salary is only about 40 yuan, how can we cope with the continued rise in July? Furthermore, considering that the bank's administrative expenses are higher than personnel expenses, it is even clearer how meager our colleagues' remuneration is. Today, in order to request the bank to consider the difficult lives of our colleagues and immediately agree to our demand to use a base salary of 100 yuan based on the current month's cost of living index as the basis for calculation, we have decided to fast starting from noon today, awaiting a response." After the employees implemented the hunger strike yesterday, the bank convened a meeting of the standing directors at the 240 Beijing Road branch to discuss the employees' demands. As of 8:00 PM last night, there was still no resolution, and negotiations will continue today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the employees of the China &amp; South Sea Bank Shanghai Branch at 7 Zhongzheng East 1st Road have also initiated a hunger strike due to remuneration issues since the day before. Yesterday, employees of the five sub-branches at Henan Road, Lin Sen Central Road, Jing'an Temple, 16 Pu, and Yushichang successively responded, but the employees continued to work as usual.</p>

<p>In addition, the military and police authorities have also obtained a list of more than 100 major dealers suspected of hoarding, which they are also preparing to thoroughly investigate, including (1) 27 cotton yarn companies, (2) 26 cotton cloth companies, (3) 17 companies engaged in arbitrage, (4) 20 black market gold and banknote dealers, (5) 19 rice companies, and (6) more than 10 securities companies.</p>
<p>Another Report: According to the "blacklist" investigation of the actions of various speculators, the inspectors of the Garrison Headquarters and the economic police of the Municipal Police Bureau continued to conduct secret operations yesterday. According to the responsible authorities, this work will continue for several days, and the targets of the investigation are very broad. Those who are found to have definite evidence will be arrested.</p>
<p>Eliminate Smuggling by Sea, Land, and Air: A Joint Inspection Agency Is Established.</p>
<p>Commander Xuan of the Songhu Garrison Command, in order to strengthen the unified security forces of the military, police, and gendarmerie and to meet the current needs, has decided to establish a joint military, police, and gendarmerie inspection agency in this city, which will be established in the coming days. The agency will be divided into three groups: (1) a joint maritime inspection group, (2) a joint land inspection group, and (3) a joint aviation inspection group. Each group will include 20 inspectors from the Garrison Headquarters, a platoon of police officers from the Police Bureau, and a platoon from the 9th Regiment of the Gendarmerie. The candidates for the heads of each group have already been internally decided and will be officially announced soon. After the agency is established, its mission will be to control the key routes on the sea, land, and air lines in this city, eliminate smuggling, and prevent criminals from posing as porters to infiltrate Shanghai. Therefore, it will have a significant impact on the city's economic, political, military, and public security.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Finch FRS—140C Facsimile Telegraph Machine <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Xiaodong</p>
<p>The Finch FRS—140C facsimile telegraph machine is designed specifically for transmitting official documents and letters. Its sending and receiving components are housed within a single casing, offering an aesthetically pleasing appearance and precise mechanisms. Although the circuitry is complex, the wiring is compact, and small vacuum tubes are used, minimizing the space it occupies. As a result, the entire machine is about the size of a teletype machine. The operational method is mostly automated, making it very convenient. The operator does not need special skills. However, if a malfunction occurs, the closely packed components may make it difficult to quickly repair. A brief description of its circuit and mechanical parts is provided below, along with a comparison to the facsimile telegraph machines currently used by our bureau from Western Union.</p>
<p>This facsimile telegraph machine has both its receiving and sending components housed in the same casing, each with a rotating drum driven by a synchronous motor, rotating at the same speed of 180 revolutions per minute. The light source, photocell, and amplifier of the sending component are all mounted on a carriage. For every 105 rotations of the sending drum, the carriage moves one inch to the right, parallel to the drum's axis. Therefore, the scanning density is 105 lines per inch. Our bureau's existing Western Union facsimile machine also has a drum speed of 180 revolutions per minute and a scanning density of 100 lines per inch. Therefore, in terms of receiving detail and transmission speed, the two are only slightly different.</p>
<p>The receiving method of this machine involves a raised helical groove on the surface of the receiving drum, with the pitch equal to the length of the drum, and the drum length equal to the circumference of the sending drum. There is also a printing bar parallel to the drum's axis, pressed against the drum. As the drum rotates, the contact point between the printing bar and the drum represents the various points on the helical groove. The receiving paper moves upwards between the printing bar and the drum. Each rotation of the drum scans one line onto the paper. After 105 rotations, the receiving paper moves one inch upwards, so the number of times the contact point scans the paper is exactly equal to the number of times the original document is scanned by the light source. The receiving paper is a special electrochemical paper. The signal current is applied to the drum, flows from the helical groove through the receiving paper and the printing bar, and then returns to the power source. The areas of the receiving paper where the current flows turn black, and the degree of blackening is approximately proportional to the strength of the current. Therefore, it can also receive photographs and drawings of varying shades. Testing has shown that its performance seems to be better than the receiving method used by Western Union. The receiving paper used is an 8-inch wide paper roll that moves continuously upwards between the drum and the printing bar. Therefore, there is no need to change the paper after each receipt, and the operator can observe the receiving process to see if it is good and notify the other party to adjust or resend at any time. However, this type of receiving paper must be kept at an appropriate humidity, which is an inconvenience.</p>
<p>The loading and unloading of the original document for sending are both automatic, but the width of the sending paper must be between 8 inches and 2 inches, and the length can be up to /1 inch. The original document for sending is attached to the drum by two rows of small nails, which leave nail holes on both sides of the paper. If the automatic mechanism malfunctions slightly, it may damage the original document and prevent it from being sent. A malfunction of the automatic unloading mechanism may also damage the original document, which is a drawback of this machine.</p>
<p>In terms of photoelectric components, a focused light source is used to illuminate the original document, and the reflected light is directed onto a photocell. At this time, the output of the photocell is a direct current pulsating current, which is amplified by a DC amplifier 6AG5 to obtain an inverted output - the output is greatest when the light source scans a black area, and the smallest when it scans a white area - another identical amplifier 6AG5 has an output that balances the output of the first one, the purpose of which is to prevent distortion of the output.</p>
<p>The modulation method of this machine uses a balanced modulator, with two 6BE tubes connected in a push-pull configuration. An oscillator 6AG5 generates the required subcarrier - 1700 Hz - using a phase inverter 6AG5, two carriers with the same amplitude but opposite phases are obtained and input to the second grids of the two balanced modulator tubes. The signal voltage output from the balanced amplifier is simultaneously input to the first grids of the two tubes, and an amplitude modulated wave is generated in the plate circuit. The original pulsating signal voltage is not present in the output, so transient voltages are eliminated.</p>
<p>The modulation method of the Western Union facsimile machine uses a mechanical chopper, so the output of its photocell is direct current, which can use an audio amplifier. That is its advantage, but the chopper is installed in the optical system and feels quite bulky. Its carrier frequency is neither stable nor easy to be symmetrical, not as good as Finch's using an oscillator.</p>
<p>After modulation, the signal is finally amplified by a 6J6 tube and connected to the output line. At the same time, a portion is sent to the receiving component of this machine, so that the sending end operator can monitor the quality of the transmission.</p>
<p>The circuit of the receiving component is relatively simple. After amplification by 6BE6, 6AG5, and two 6V6 tubes in parallel, and rectification by a selenium rectifier, the original direct current pulsating current is obtained, which is connected to the receiving drum and draws a copy of the original document on the receiving paper.</p>
<p>Another part is the automatic phasing equipment. This machine connects a relay between the receiving end motor and the power supply. The action of the relay cuts off the power supply, causing the synchronous motor to slip, changing the relative position of the receiving drum with respect to the sending drum to achieve phasing. The key to controlling the relay is to send a phasing signal after each rotation of the sending drum. The sending drum axis is equipped with four cams of different shapes. The first and second cams are connected in parallel to the plate circuit of the last stage amplifier of the sending circuit. Normally, the first cam connects the plate voltage, so the signal current is output. However, when the light source finishes scanning one line of the sending and starts the second line, corresponding to a time of 45 degrees of drum rotation - because the sending paper is shorter than the circumference of the drum, so there is no signal current output during this time - the first cam cuts off the plate voltage of the amplifier tube, but during 25 degrees of this 45 degrees, the second cam connects the plate voltage. At this time, the third cam has cut off the anode voltage of the photocell, with the cut-off time corresponding to 35 degrees of the 45 degrees. Therefore, the output of the amplifier tube is actually a completely black signal corresponding to 25 degrees long, with a white signal of 10 degrees before and after this black signal. Each rotation of the drum, i.e., each time the light source scans a line, has this signal output. This is the phasing signal.</p>
<p>After the receiving end receives this phasing signal, it is amplified together with the signal current by the 6BE6 and 6AG5 stages, and then input to the automatic phasing circuit through a cathode coupler. This circuit has two phasing tubes (2-6AG5), and their screen grid voltages are controlled by the fourth cam on the drum axis. Normally, there is no voltage, only when the light source scans between the two lines, corresponding to 7 degrees of one drum rotation - i.e., the middle 7 degrees of the above 45 degrees - the voltage is connected. If the phasing signal is appropriately input at this time, after the circuit with the two clipping tubes (the two parts of the dual diode 6AL5) and the two phasing tubes, it has no effect on the multivibrator 6J6, and the relay also has no effect. The motor drives the drum to rotate as before. This situation indicates that the relative positions of the two drums at the sending and receiving ends are correct, i.e., they are in phase. However, when the phasing signal is input to the phasing circuit, and the phasing tube screen grid has no voltage - due to the different relative positions of the two drums - the second phasing tube outputs current, causing the multivibrator to have a trigger effect, and the amplifier (6AG5) connected to this tube generates a plate current. This current passes through the relay coil, causing the relay to act and cut off the motor power supply. The duration of the cut-off is sufficient to cause the motor to slip a small angular distance, thus causing the receiving drum to pause for a moment. If the position of the drum after the pause is still different from the sending drum, and the timing of the phasing signal still does not match the time when the phasing tube is applied with the screen grid voltage, the relay acts again, until the relative positions of the two drums are correct before stopping. At this time, phasing is achieved, and then the two motors drive the drum to rotate in the normal state.</p>
<p>This kind of phasing equipment seems too complicated in this small facsimile machine. Because when the power supplies of the sending and receiving machines are the same, it is only necessary to obtain phasing at the beginning of the start-up, and then phasing can be maintained. If the power supplies at the two ends are different, it is necessary to add a synchronous power supply equipment, so it is only necessary to obtain phasing at the beginning. This equipment sends out phasing signals every week, in addition to the initial few signals, the rest of the signals seem to have no effect. The bureau's Western Union facsimile machine automatically phases at the beginning of each report, and the circuit used is simpler, but when the transmission circuit conditions change, manual adjustment is still required. The two seem to have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>In summary, the Finch facsimile machine is more modern, and the test results are satisfactory. However, if the mechanical aspects can be made more precise, flexible, durable, and undamaged, it would be quite adoptable.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Story of Telegraph Registration <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Dinghua</p>
<p>The Beginning of the Story</p>
<p>One day, a simple and sincere face asked the lady at the public service desk:</p>
<p>"Miss, where do I register for a telegraph?"</p>
<p>"Send a telegraph... register where?" The lady's surprised gaze rested on the stranger's face. In her mind, she thought that this customer must have made a mistake. Thus, with the politeness and responsibility that a salesperson should have, she explained, not fearing the tediousness:</p>
<p>"Sir, you're mistaken. You don't need to register to send a telegraph." She opened the drawer and took out a piece of paper: "This is a telegraph form. Please take it, fill it out, and hand it in at window number four."</p>
<p>What is "Telegraph Registration?"</p>
<p>Sending a telegraph requires registration; that was a misunderstanding. It turned out that something called "Telegraph Registration" was at play in that person's mind. So, what exactly is "Telegraph Registration"? Here, let's first give it a definition.</p>
<p>"Telegraph Registration" is a number that a user registers with the telecommunications bureau, representing the user's name and address. By using this registration, the user can obtain convenience when sending telegrams and save unnecessary telegraph costs.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about its first benefit—convenience and speed.</p>
<p>After you have registered a telegraph registration number, your branch offices, business associates, or friends in other locations can use it to send you telegrams. (Of course, you must first let them know what "number" you've "registered.") The telecommunications bureau handles telegrams for registered users more simply than for general telegrams, using a ready-made wooden stamp (which will be discussed below) to stamp on the telegram envelope to replace the trouble of manual writing and to avoid errors, and also to achieve the purpose of speed.</p>
<p>Let's talk about its second benefit—saving telegraph costs.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to send a telegram to "Dahua Enterprise Company, No. 135 Linsen Road, Chongqing." Counting the words, apart from "Chongqing," which is calculated as one word according to regulations, the recipient's address alone has sixteen words. (Even if you write 135 in parentheses as (135), it still requires twelve words.) Now, suppose the registration number of that Dahua Company at the local telecommunications bureau is 1129. Then, this messy, long address of sixteen words becomes simple, with just "1129 Chongqing," which is counted as two words. It saves fourteen words compared to the original. Assuming that an ordinary telegram costs one million per word, you can save fourteen million at a time. If it's urgent, you save twenty-eight million. If you average one telegram per day, you'll accumulate more than eight million in a month. What about in a year? More than one hundred million will be spent, plus the interest. Isn't it an even bigger loss?</p>
<p>How to Register Your "Telegraph Registration?"</p>
<p>The telecommunications bureau serves the public by not only speeding up telegrams but also planning for the economic benefits of its users everywhere. "Telegraph Registration" is a clear example.</p>
<p>So, how do you get a registration number? Here are some ways to do it:</p>
<p>Telegraph registrations are divided into two types: Chinese and foreign. Chinese registrations consist of four Arabic numerals. Foreign registrations consist of four or more, but no more than ten, English letters. However, because the situation in Shanghai is special, the 10,000 Chinese registrations from 0000 to 9999 are not enough. Starting from January 7th of this year, six-digit registrations have been exceptionally adopted. This way, the quota can be expanded, and users will not be turned away.</p>
<p>You probably still remember that in the past, on the first day of each month, there was a long line of people at the entrance of the telecommunications bureau early in the morning, all squeezing to register. Some even came from far away, but went back empty-handed because they couldn't get a registration. Since the adoption of six-digit registrations, this situation no longer exists. Users can register for a number at any time.</p>
<p>The validity period of a telegraph registration is divided into two types: long-term for one year and short-term for three months. The registration fee is 1.2 million for one year and 300,000 for three months, paid in full at one time.</p>
<p>Having understood these things, you can now go to the registration group (No. 25 Changzhi Road) of the telecommunications bureau to get a telegraph registration application form. Fill in the registration number, household, address, telephone number, and registration period on the form, sign and seal it, and submit it to the clerk inside along with the registration fee.</p>
<p>Here is a point that you need to pay attention to. If you are registering for a Chinese registration number, leave the "registration number" column blank. The telecommunications bureau will give you an appropriate number based on which area your address belongs to. It's not up to you to pick or designate, because Shanghai users are really crowded and your chosen registration number might already be taken.</p>
<p>If you are registering for a foreign registration number, please do not use proper nouns such as the names of countries, provinces, or cities, or other common nouns. The ideal is to use the initials of the company's name plus a CO. For example, the registration number of Far Eastern Sanitary CO. is FESCO.</p>
<p>After you receive a telegraph registration certificate from the registration group clerk, you can start using it after three days.</p>
<p>To speed up the delivery of your telegram, you need to prepare a rubber stamp that is 1 inch long and ½ inch wide, and have your "registration number," "name," "address," and "telephone" engraved on it, and hand it over to the registration group for use.</p>
<p>Several Points to Note</p>
<p>1. Regarding relocation—when your address is relocated, please notify the registration group in writing so that it can be changed and delivered according to the new address. If your new address is in another area (the telecommunications bureau's delivery area is different from the post office's), you must send the original registration certificate to the registration group for cancellation and receive a new registration number and a new certificate.</p>
<p>2. Regarding expiration—three days before the registration expires, the registration group will send you a "Telegraph Registration Expiration Notice Card." If you want to continue using the registration, please fill it out as instructed, sign and seal it, and send it to the registration group along with the registration fee payable to receive a new certificate. If you do not intend to renew, the registration will be invalid on the day after the expiration date. However, for the convenience of users, long-term registrations will be tried once within two months after expiration, and short-term registrations will be tried once within one month after expiration. After the expiration date, delivery will be stopped.</p>
<p>3. Regarding transfer—telegraph registrations cannot be transferred to others to avoid confusion. However, if the company is reorganized or for other reasons and needs to change the name, you can apply in writing, stating the reasons in detail, and continue to use it after paying another fee, otherwise it will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Telegraph Registration Today</p>
<p>Telegraph registration is now widely used. According to the latest statistics from the registration group, there are more than 13,000 Chinese registrations and more than 6,000 foreign registrations. There are also dozens of new applications for registration every day.</p>
<p>Telegraph registration will give you many conveniences, indirectly help the development of your career, and the cost is not expensive. So, friends, please go to the telecommunications bureau to register a number!</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Innovation of Telegraph Codes <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Binhui</p>
<p>—Introduction to Idiom Code Book</p>
<p>In recent years, in order to reduce the number of words in telegrams, people in China who use telegrams often compile consecutive words or common idioms into telegraph codes. Although this is a good method, it is mostly limited to a certain unit or a certain specialized business. Not only is the scope of application too narrow, but it is also not perfect and cannot be used universally. Sometimes, because the meaning of the telegraph words is unclear, the telecommunications bureau calculates the fees as if they were codes, so there is not much saving for the person sending the telegram.</p>
<p>In view of these shortcomings, the Ministry of Communications appointed several experts in the field of telecommunications to study and collect various materials, including the names of various agencies and commonly used phrases in telegrams in various businesses, as well as various nouns related to daily life, to compile a book of idiom codes that can be used by the public. Using a new classification method to facilitate character retrieval. The advantages of this newly compiled code book are:</p>
<p>First, it saves telegraph costs. One code can replace a group of words.</p>
<p>Second, because one code replaces a group of words, the efficiency of telegraph transmission is also greatly improved. Both the translation process and the telegraph transmission are shortened, and the efficiency of telecommunications is improved.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of materials, it also saves a lot of labor and materials.</p>
<p>Fourth, in terms of manpower, the translation of codes and the processing of telegrams can save a lot of procedures.</p>
<p>Fifth, the collection of idioms is extensive and can be widely applied.</p>
<p>Sixth, the classification and arrangement are novel, making it very convenient to translate codes or words.</p>
<p>Seventh, the content is substantial. After the main text, it is also accompanied by phonetic symbols, English letters, various commonly used symbols, calendar rhyme titles, contemporary names, foreign place names, etc., for reference.</p>
<p>The creation of idiom codes is indeed a new contribution to the telecommunications industry. The book is divided into two volumes, upper and lower, with a total of 100,000 codes. All single characters in the newly compiled code are included, so the application is very convenient. The book is expected to be published in mid-October, and reservations are now being accepted from today. The cost of each book (two volumes) is temporarily set at 1.5 million for reservations. The reservation period ends at the end of August this year. The location for making reservations is the Business Inspection Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau on Fuzhou Road.</p>

<p>Telecommunication Knowledge Talk (12) Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Fifth Lecture: Writing in Telegrams (Continued)</p>
<p>Although Chinese cipher telegrams are written in Chinese, when translated into code for transmission, they are not newly translated according to the Ministry of Transportation's new codebook. Instead, they are translated according to a different codebook mutually agreed upon by the sender and receiver. Therefore, unless one possesses the same codebook, the contents of the telegram cannot be understood. Even the telegraph office staff handling the telegram are no exception. The characteristic of cipher telegrams is that they easily maintain confidentiality. According to the Ministry of Transportation's regulations, Chinese ciphers are limited to groups of four or five numerals.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, perhaps some readers, recognizing the confidentiality benefits of using ciphers, intend to try sending telegrams in code. Then, the author can conveniently tell you some good news: for the benefit of customers, the Ministry of Transportation has long hired experts since before the war to compile Chinese idiom ciphers. Each cipher group can replace up to fourteen characters, which is not only confidential but also cost-effective. It is currently being typeset and will soon be published for sale.</p>
<p>Plain language telegrams in foreign languages are telegrams written in a certain foreign language. The meaning must be clear, the sentences must be coherent, and the original interpretation of the words must not be lost. The use of letters or numeral combinations without secret meanings is also permitted in plain language telegrams, such as telegraphic registered addresses, business logos, exchange rates, and various abbreviations commonly used in general or commercial correspondence, such as FOB, CIF, CAF, SVP, LBS, YD, DR, DORS, STLG, and so on.</p>
<p>Foreign language code is stipulated to be formed of five letters in a group, translated according to a secret codebook agreed upon by the sender and receiver. Its characteristic is not only confidentiality, but also cost-effectiveness. Various countries in Europe and America have complete foreign language idiom codebooks for distribution. Shanghai bookstores or used bookstores sometimes sell them. The rate for international code telegrams is 40% cheaper than for similar plain language telegrams, so most agencies and businesses with more international telegrams usually send telegrams in code.</p>
<p>Foreign language composed words include: (1) single or grouped foreign language letters, not in groups of five letters (as in foreign language code), and without a clear explanation, or (2) superficially complete foreign language words, but with disjointed sentences that do not conform to the original meaning of the words, or (3) single numerals or numeral combinations with secret meanings.</p>
<p>Telegraph offices can accept telegrams written in a combination of Chinese and foreign languages, or plain and cipher languages. The only exception is that any mixed combination of numerals and letters containing secret meanings, or a combination of letters, numerals, and punctuation marks, is strictly prohibited. (End of Lecture 5)</p>
<p>Lecture 6: How to Calculate the Number of Words</p>
<p>"Knowing how, but not knowing why" is a common saying that accurately points out that relying solely on experience is insufficient in everything. Taking the drafting of telegrams as an example, due to my professional duties, I sometimes need to review old telegrams and have found that senders who frequently send telegrams usually know how to write the draft simply and concisely. However, in our professional opinion, not only is the saying "fewer words, lower cost" not an absolute rule, even if the original telegram draft is written as is, there is no more economical way to write it. As long as readers are familiar with telegraph regulations and use them flexibly at any time, they can certainly achieve the ultimate goal of "obtaining the greatest effect at the smallest cost."</p>
<p>On a telegram form, the addressee's name and address and the telegram text are the two main parts that occupy the most words. Except for a few special exceptions, the latter generally contains more words than the former. Various methods of saving words in the addressee's name and address, such as using telegraphic registered addresses, telephone numbers, and PO box numbers as mentioned earlier to replace the addressee's name and address, are simple procedures, but require the cooperation of the addressee to achieve. In other words, if the addressee does not apply for registration at the local telegraph office, or does not have a telephone installed, or does not rent a PO box, then the sender's wish to reduce the number of words in the addressee's name and address cannot be realized. Therefore, we can also say that the sender can only take the initiative to save on the number of words in the telegram text. What follows is an introduction to various methods of calculating the number of words in telegrams. Precisely because examples of saving words in telegrams can be found everywhere in the draft, I do not intend to passively search for examples in the draft, but rather to actively introduce the basic methods used by telegraph offices to calculate the number of words in telegrams in a comprehensive way. Only in this way can I help all of you thoroughly understand.</p>

<p>The time in various parts of the world is not consistent due to differences in the angle of sunlight. Time is an extremely important factor in telecommunications transmission. Sometimes, due to the difference in time between the sending and receiving locations, the recipient may have doubts about the time required for the telegram's transmission, believing that the telegraph office made a mistake in the telegram's transmission. In fact, it is entirely due to the time difference. I would now like to list the time differences in various parts of our country as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e103">The National Bank Decides to Massively Sell Off Supplies The Market Saw a Slight Decline Yesterday The Authorities Tighten Credit, and Banks Have Huge Clearing Deficits <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] In order to completely suppress prices, the Central Bank has decided to massively sell off supplies. Yesterday, it specially allocated 16,100 bolts of fine cloth bills of lading from Qingfeng and Huayang Factories and requested the Yarn Control Commission to quickly forward them to the Textile Construction Company for sale as much as possible. The rice market in the city was stable yesterday, and prices slightly declined, which is closely related to the authorities' policy of inspecting warehouses and selling off supplies.</p>
<p>According to business circles, in the Legislative Yuan meeting, in addition to firmly opposing the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, when examining the budget, it was decided to balance national fiscal revenue and expenditure by selling US aid materials. All of this has a positive impact on market sentiment. However, due to the concentration of speculative capital in Shanghai, credit remains loose. Unless the selling policy can be implemented persistently, the price situation is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the President is particularly concerned that the storm of prices in Shanghai has not disappeared. He has telegraphed Liu Gongyun of the National Bank in recent afternoons to inquire about everything and provide instructions. It is heard that the authorities have decided to start from the root to stabilize prices by massively selling off supplies and tightening credit. The huge clearing deficits of banks and financial institutions yesterday mark the beginning of tightening credit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the money market in the city was loose first and then tight yesterday. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had an unprecedented clearing deficit of 328.73 billion due to the sale of cotton yarn to settle payments yesterday. Among them, the Bank of China had the largest clearing deficit of 117.01 billion, followed by the Central Bank with 110.45 billion, the Bank of Communications with 45.67 billion, the Farmers Bank with 19.49 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau with 20.87 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury with 15.66 billion, and the China Trust Bureau with 42 billion. Large commercial banks and financial institutions had a clearing deficit of 172.11 billion, and small clearing deficits of 276.9 billion. Foreign banks also set an unprecedented record with a total clearing deficit of 120.28 billion.</p>
<p>According to estimates from the Central Bank, due to the lack of cash recently, most commercial banks and financial institutions have been using cashier's checks to meet customer withdrawals. Therefore, it is predicted that some banks and financial institutions will have more difficulty coping after this tightening. The bank estimates that the money market will become tighter again today.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The National Bank Resumes Cotton Selling Work And Moves Out a Large Amount of Cloth for Sale by China Textile <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The long-suspended cotton selling work started again yesterday. China Textile listed prices yesterday, selling cotton on behalf of the Central Bank, and stipulated eight measures: (1) Purchase requests for cotton are temporarily limited to member factories of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association that urgently need to replenish raw materials. (2) Purchasers should fill out the purchase request form themselves, stating the quantity they wish to purchase (unit: city dan) and the unit price per dan, and affix the seal of the yarn factory and the person in charge before dropping it into the box. (3) Purchase requests will be accepted until 11:00 AM. (4) Loans must be paid off today (checks can be paid before 11:00 AM, cashier's checks before 12:00 PM, and cash must be delivered after 12:00 PM). (5) The goods are stored in the Bank of Communications warehouse. (6) The minimum bid price is 230 million. (7) The sale of cotton is ex-warehouse, and the seed impurity and moisture content are in accordance with the regulations. (8) The cotton sold today is Shaanxi cotton.</p>
<p>A total of 300 dan of cotton were sold yesterday, recovering 69 billion national currency. Sales will continue as usual today. In addition, in order to completely suppress prices, the Central Bank has decided to massively sell off supplies. Yesterday, it specially allocated 16,100 bolts of fine cloth bills of lading from Qingfeng and Huayang Factories and requested the Yarn Control Commission to quickly forward them to China Textile for sale as much as possible.</p>
<p>The Yarn Market is Strengthening</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market yesterday rose strongly because the sharp decline the day before aroused the customer gang and reproduction factories to absorb at low prices, and prices were very firm. The final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 1.55 billion, up 100 million. The price of 42-count Bao Guang for delivery tomorrow was 1.4 billion, and 32-count Silver Moon initially quoted 1.25 billion for delivery the day before. Later, because the price allocated by the Yarn Control Commission was lower, the final price for same-day delivery was 1.2 billion. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 1.1 billion. Later, due to the tight credit situation of the industry, many sellers sold at high prices, and the price dropped to the 1 billion mark, resulting in a transaction at 1.007 billion. The price for delivery tomorrow was 1.1 billion. The prices of other grades of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 50 million to 70 million or 80 million, with a total of 64 contracts and 237 transactions.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth is Firm</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market yesterday started firm due to absorption by counter gangs, and the market gradually showed strength. Later, due to the bidding by the Textile Construction Company, dyeing factories were short of funds and sold gray cloth, and cloth merchants also sold to make profits, so the price fell. By the time of closing, the floating space to make up positions turned firm again. The initial price of Longtou fine cloth outside the market was 39.5 million, which once rose to 42 million. Later, due to profit-taking sales, the final transaction price was 37.5 million, and the market closed at 36.5 million, up 1.5 million yuan. Other fine cloths, such as drill, bleached cloth, and Shilin cloth, were also consistently in short supply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Textile Construction Company's bid price for Caiqiu fine cloth was 33 million to 3.5 million, the price of Sunshine fine cloth was 33.4 million, and the price of Jinlian Miaowu Yuan drill was 35.5 million to 6.5 million.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that China Textile continued to sell cloth, selling a total of 17,450 bolts yesterday, 520 bed sheets, with a total amount of 572.19 billion yuan. It also sold 880 bolts on behalf of the Yarn Control Commission, with an amount of 29.168 billion yuan. The sale of yarn remained the same, with a total of 288 pieces, with an amount of 29.168 billion yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Silk is Weakening <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The artificial silk market was stable in the morning yesterday but plummeted in the afternoon. The opening price of 120-count Jin San Ma bright silk in the morning was 1.85 billion, which once fell to 1.78 billion. The closing price in the afternoon rose again to 1.83 billion for spot price, and the price for delivery the day before was quoted at 1.92 billion. The opening price in the afternoon rose to as high as 1.98 billion. Suddenly, news of huge clearing deficits of banks and financial institutions caused people's hearts to become weak, and the market plummeted, closing as low as 1.76 billion. Finally, the price outside the market fell further to 1.7 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The factory warp market started firm but then weakened yesterday, with the quoted prices of each grade decreasing by about 150 million yuan compared to the previous day. The high scattered price of 1.95 billion had a few transactions in the morning, and the selling price fell to 1.85 billion in the afternoon, but there were no transactions. The high scattered price of dry warp had a transaction at 1.55 billion in the morning, and the final quoted price also decreased by about 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market fell yesterday. The spot price of pure silk quilt cover had a maximum transaction of 1.003 billion in the morning, and the closing price fell to 980 million. The price for delivery the day before was 1.002 billion, and the price outside the market in the afternoon fell to around 960 million. The quoted price of checkered crepe de Chine in the morning was 3.4 million, which decreased by about 100,000 yuan in the afternoon, but there were no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e106">New Qihong Tea Will Arrive Soon <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The new Qimen black tea of this year has not yet been officially launched on the market. It is learned that some of it has been completed and will soon arrive in Shanghai to present new tea. It is also heard that tea merchants there have sent samples to the Anhui Tea Company in the city. It is said that the goods are still not bad, but the asking price is surprisingly high, reaching as high as 100 million yuan per dan. The reason is that the price of tea in our country is roughly based on the price of rice. Now, every 100 jin of tea is worth about two shi of white rice, and the cost of processing and all payments is extremely large, so the seller cannot bear to part with it easily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the tea market, which has been rising for many days, has been slightly dampened by the tight credit situation of buyers. The process finally felt weak and unable to rise. As a result of the closing, the market showed a hovering state, and some varieties were still slightly firm due to the scarcity of supply and demand.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Wool Textile Industry Asks for Permission to Offset Unexpired Foreign Currency Deposit Slips <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Representatives of the wool textile industry in the city, Cheng Nianpeng, Tang Hua Ru, Yang Li Ren, etc., visited President Yu of the Central Bank yesterday morning regarding the industry's special foreign currency deposit slips. The industry's foreign currency deposit slips total 3 million US dollars. The representatives requested that those before May 30 be used to offset the import quotas for the fourth and fifth periods, and those after May 30 be settled according to the Central Bank's exchange rate. Mr. Yu's reply at the time was that although this matter was raised by the wool textile industry, it is related to other industries and needs to be studied and investigated before a decision can be made. Representatives of the wool textile industry plan to go to the Central Bank again in one or two days to petition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the import and export industry has repeatedly negotiated with President Yu of the Central Bank on the technical issue of issuing foreign exchange deposit slips for goods arriving at the port without a license. This batch of foreign currency deposit slips is extremely large. In the past, the Central Bank sacrificed selling forward foreign exchange for temporary expediency, but today it has clearly encountered major difficulties because the current shortage of foreign currency holdings of the Central Bank makes payment a major problem. In the past, there was talk of paying at the exchange rate, but the importers firmly opposed it, demanding that the Central Bank fulfill the contract, resulting in a stalemate. It is now learned that the matter is still under detailed study by the financial authorities, and a concrete decision is expected in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Whether the Transport Management Committee Will Be Abolished A Decision Can Be Made in a Short Time <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] It is learned that during the current Legislative Yuan meeting, many legislators advocate abolishing the Transport Management Committee, believing that the committee's functions actually belong to the Central Bank and the Customs. After the division, due to the lack of specialization of functions, many delays are caused. Therefore, they advocate abolishing the committee or moving it to South China. A decision on this matter can be made in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Rice Prices Rise Sharply and Then Retreat Slightly Yesterday's Rice Prices Dropped by 500,000 to 1 Million <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The rice market has stopped rising and is weakening. Due to the tightening of credit, various non-industry commodities have seen a decline, and people's hearts have turned weak. Although the cargo owners are still trying to raise prices, they already feel weak. Only early rice and indica rice are on the market, and the price is about 1 million lower. White japonica rice outside the market has retreated to within 30 million, at 29.5 million. Thin rice is still standing at the 30 million mark due to its scarcity. Early rice is traded at the limit price, and medium and lower indica rice are mostly within the limit price. All rice has dropped by 500,000 to 1 million, with 3,052 shi arriving yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour is rising. Wheat is scarce and the price is high, so factories sell very little. In addition, the price was lower the previous day, and the cargo owners have the intention to hold up the price, so the market is firm. The early opening price of Lao Che flour once reached 9.4 million, but later retreated to 9.2 million, up 300,000. Bingchuan flour closed at 9.05 million, up 250,000. Red Bee and other miscellaneous brands are unanimously firm by 200,000 to 300,000. Bran is flat, and wheat has not been traded.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains have unanimously turned flat. The rise the previous day was too high, and people's hearts are themselves weak. In addition, the tightening of credit has stopped the rising trend. Hankou Zhazadou opened at 14.9 million, but high-quality goods were traded at 15.5 million. Corn is scarce, rising by 1 million. Red sorghum has fallen back by 1 million. Green beans are flat and weak. Sesame supply is comparable, and the market is flat. Raw peanuts are slightly weak, falling by 1 million across the board.</p>
<p>Edible oil saw a small retreat yesterday. Because the price is at a high peak, people's hearts are cold. Moreover, all grains are showing weakness, and credit is tight, so the market is hovering and weak. Soybean oil still struggled at 66 million at the early opening, but finally retreated to 65 million at the close due to more sales. Rapeseed oil was 63 million, down 1 million each. Raw oil and small cart sesame oil were flat. The former was 78 million for pure raw oil, and the latter was 74 million for Jitung small cart oil. Soybean cake is cautious at high levels, and the drop is the largest, falling by 700,000 to 800,000. Raw Renji fell to the 7 million mark.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that due to the scarcity of rice sources in the city in recent days, the price has been rising. In Wuxi and other areas, a large amount of rice hoarding has been discovered, which has aroused close attention from the central authorities. The Ministry of Food has sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Market Conditions in Various Places <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang [Our Reporter in Zhenjiang, 13th] Rice prices have risen again. The black market price of rice is now 32 million. The Provincial Department of Land and Food has received confidential reports that the Soviet rice plate is now avoiding inspections on the banks of the Yangtze River and is mostly exported from the Jinshan River area. The numbers are very large, and there are suspicions of aiding bandits. The Provincial Security Command has been telegraphed to instruct its subordinates to pay attention.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Our Reporter in Suzhou, 13th] Credit in Suzhou is extremely tight today, and prices of all commodities have been forced to fall back. Only rice prices are still rising. The price of early polished japonica rice is 26 million, the price of secondary white rice is 29 million, and the negotiated price for door sales is 29.9 million, which is an increase of 2.5 million compared to the previous day. The Su County Government has presented a report to the Provincial Government, which has approved the sale of 5,000 shi of tax grain from tomorrow to try to suppress the rising trend.</p>
<p>Mingguang [Our Reporter in Mingguang, 13th] Prices of all grains have risen sharply: rice is 26 million, wheat is 17 million, tea beans are 25 million, and soybeans are 19 million.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter in Nanjing, 13th] The Ministry of Finance is currently considering whether to abolish or modify the method of limiting remittances and carrying cash to Shanghai and Guangzhou to 200 million yuan. According to a certain authoritative person from the Ministry of Finance, this limit of 200 million yuan is no longer reasonable today. However, whether to completely open up or to relax the limit is still under study, and there is currently no concrete decision.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Zhejiang Tea Exports are Weak and are Eagerly Awaiting Loans for Relief <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 13th] Zhejiang Province's tea exports are weak. The total amount of tea exported from the province in three years is only over 60,000 dan, which is only one-third of the pre-war level. Among them, about 30,000 dan were transported to North Africa, about 12,000 dan were transported to the United States, and about 19,000 dan were transported to England and various places in Europe and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The reason is that manufacturers have weak capital, so many abandon picking. This year's tea is approaching its peak season, and the price of raw tea in the producing areas has increased by 20 times compared to last year. Manufacturers are unable to reach it, so manufacturers are eagerly awaiting improvements in the tea loan policy so that the loan method can be adapted to the actual cost of the producing areas.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Credit is Tight and Hearts are Weak Chinese Stocks Show a Rebound and then Tend to Weaken <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were forced by the tight credit situation yesterday, and the opening and closing could not avoid weakness. Halfway through, the rebound fluctuated repeatedly. Yongsha first soared to a new high of 10,400 yuan. Due to rumors and huge clearing deficits, it plummeted to 9,200 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>The morning opening was low at 9,350 yuan due to the severe shortage of funds in financial institutions the day before, and people's hearts were inevitably affected. Shares such as 226 and 145 were sold to 9,050 yuan. Shares such as 180 and 148 came in and immediately rebounded to 9,750 yuan. After entering, shares such as 60 and 173 were settled at high prices, and it was easy to return after the high. Halfway through, the struggle between 9,300 yuan and 9,600 yuan continued. However, near noon, shares such as 206 and 8 were purchased, pulling the price from 9,250 yuan to 9,870 yuan at the close. Shanghai Mud once again rose to the limit. Matches rebounded after falling to the limit. Meiya Lilian Zhongsi Jingfu rose by 10%, and Xinguang Huafeng Yonggong Jinglun Zhabei rose by 5%. Huaxin Xinyi fell by 5%. The rise and fall of the remaining shares were very small.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yongsha first entered the market at 10,300 yuan, and shares such as 761 and 157 rose to a new high of 10,400 yuan. Meiya Shanghai Mud rose to the limit. Unexpectedly, along with rumors, shares such as 76 and 157 turned from buying to selling. Shares such as 71 and 88 were sold one after another, falling to 9,500 yuan. Although shares such as 183 and 148 entered to 9,650 yuan, shares such as 176 and 197 were sold again. Due to the huge clearing deficits of the National Bank, the price fell to 9,150 yuan. Matches, China-France, Qinxing, Jinglun, Zhongsi, and Xinhua fell to the limit. Shares such as 196 and 95 were purchased. The closing price was 9,200 yuan. Compared with the morning close, Zhongsi and matches fell to the limit. Underwear was flat. Guohuo Jinglun Jingfu fell by 5%. The rest rose and fell by only 5% to 10%. The unlisted cultural shares outside the market rose by another 5%, and the rest were mediocre.</p>
<p>Government bonds were slightly stable yesterday. Tongbing rose from 1.21 million at the early opening to 1.26 million, retreated to 1.09 million, and then rebounded slightly. Compared with the previous close, Jia and Yi rose by 20,000 yuan, Bing Zhang rose by 60,000 yuan, Ding rose by 30,000 yuan, and Wuhao rose by 50,000 yuan. The turnover was about 3.4 million.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The allocation of rice for teachers in private primary and secondary schools in this city for August should be distributed by the Civil Food Allocation Committee after each school compiles a roster certified by the Bureau of Education, according to the special rice allocation implementation rules. Currently, the Bureau of Education lacks data on the number of employees in each school for August, making it difficult to review the rosters. As a result of negotiations between the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation with the Civil Allocation Committee and the Bureau of Education, special rice allocation certificates can be issued based on the July roster. However, student rice allocation will be temporarily suspended in August. If schools have any changes in the number of personnel, they must still be certified by the Bureau of Education and transferred for verification. Furthermore, special rice allocation certificates for July can be collected by schools from their respective district offices starting today.</p>

<h3 id="e125">A Demonstration of Teacher-Student Collaboration: Natural Science Exhibition; Radio-Controlled Airplane; Gezhi Products Receive Praise <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education is holding a large-scale natural science achievement exhibition for middle schools. The writer visited the exhibition on schedule and spent the whole day there, finding it endlessly fascinating.</p>
<p>Firstly, science is often considered dry and uninteresting, making it difficult to arouse public interest. However, the various schools at this exhibition have managed to put on lively performances, which is quite unexpected. In particular, the Gezhi exhibition hall in the first venue had many more animated displays, such as test flights of model airplanes, eruptions of large mountain models, operation of electric train models, color changes in variable color advertising screens, operation of various miniature motors, practical use of molecular models, lantern slide shows, and radio-controlled model airplanes. These were all designed by teachers and made by students. They were demonstrated on the spot during the opening ceremony, earning praise from all sides. Director Li of the Bureau of Education also highly encouraged Lin Hewu, the student who made the self-made control machine, and promised to find a way to donate his personal shortwave radio equipment to him as encouragement. As a result, the Gezhi exhibition hall was truly crowded with people. In addition, the Dade Obstetrics School produced a self-made fertilization model, explaining the principles of fertilization. Furthermore, the Jigui Middle School installed a radio, which was open all day, providing pleasant music, adding much color to the venue. In the second venue, the French Middle School exhibition hall had a larger scale of radio products, with models of the history of radio development, drawn into simple diagrams, and the teacher demonstrated the mechanism, which triggered sound, light and electricity in succession, which was dazzling, it can be called spectacular. Also, the St. Francis Elementary School students made a flat-pack seven-tube radio, the circuit is clear, the manufacturing is exquisite, it is also a rare thing.</p>
<p>Secondly, the models made by the schools are not available from instrument companies, but they do have a great contribution to teaching. In the second venue, the Qingxin Girls' Middle School molecular structure crystal model and price model made it easy for students to understand the original structure of molecules, which greatly helped the teaching function. The complete set of three-dimensional geometry models from China Middle School, with more than a hundred kinds, can be called perfect. The steps of various chemical manufactures in the First Girls' Middle School, with sophisticated structures and clear explanations, are also very valuable products.</p>
<p>Overall, the parts performed by teachers and students in various schools are extremely vivid, and the design part is especially rich in teaching value. At a time when society is extremely unstable and life is difficult to maintain, the principals, teachers, and students of various schools are working tirelessly and burying themselves in hard work, which is truly the glory of the future of the scientific community.

<p>— Xuanxuan</p>
<p>At the end of August in the 34th year of the Republic of China, victory had just arrived, and Huang Xiangmao soap was sold everywhere. 50 Legal Tender could buy two blocks (four bars). Today, I went to the cigarette paper store to buy two bars of soap, also Huang Xiangmao, totaling 1,080,000 Legal Tender. Today is July 10th, less than three years from the day of victory, and the price of soap has risen more than 20,000 times. At that time, a news reporter made 50,000 Legal Tender per month, but today they make less than 50 million Legal Tender per month, an increase of less than 1,000 times. In other words, twenty or so people now are only equivalent to one person at that time.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 35th year of the Republic of China, Sunkist oranges flew all over the streets, and 1,000 Legal Tender could buy four to five oranges. National industrialists were worried, thinking that foreign goods should not be allowed to flood the market. Now they really don't flood the market anymore. A month ago, a Sunkist orange was sold for 600,000 Legal Tender, and the national industry is still declining. Those of us who ate Sunkist oranges at that time can't even afford domestic oranges now.</p>
<p>In the spring of the same year, the author bought a bottle of newly arrived Parker ink by the roadside, costing 800 Legal Tender. Later, it became as cheap as 600 Legal Tender. At that time, I was paid 4,000 Legal Tender per thousand words for writing articles, which could buy five bottles of ink, but it was still far less than the pre-war minimum of 2 Legal Tender per thousand words. The other day I bought a bottle of Parker ink, costing 1.2 million Legal Tender. I don't know how many Legal Tender per thousand words I can get for writing with this ink? And when I receive the fee for these thousand words, how much will a bottle of ink be worth?</p>
<p>In this chaotic world, the rich become richer, becoming wealthy and quasi-wealthy families, and the poor become poorer, rolling around in ditches. It is difficult to say that we share the same interests and feel the same pain! When everyone wants to be Yang Mei, they will naturally discover Yang Mei. Yang Mei has not eaten for nine years, and her name is uniquely highlighted after nine years. Where is a certain reason? You can think about more than half of it.</p>

<p>Before the war, on clear summer days, the Takahashi Seaside Bathing Resort was an extremely enticing place to escape the summer heat. In that "paradise" that blended natural and man-made beauty and enjoyment, it had caused many people to linger and be reluctant to leave; amidst the fragrant clothes and elegant hairstyles, it had also created countless stories of joy and sorrow… As time passed in the flames of war and turmoil, surviving the aftermath, I couldn't help but think of it again on this bank of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>One early summer day, intermittent light rain couldn't stop our longing for Takahashi Seaside. A group of three of us excitedly stepped onto the deck of the city ferry. Leaning on the railing and gazing into the distance, the river breeze brushed our faces, and memories of the past flooded our minds.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Takahashi, it drizzled again. The public bus only went to the town. Fortunately, we had brought bicycles. Seeing that the sun was still faintly hidden in the clouds, and because we were so eager to see the seaside, we ignored the raindrops and rode forward. The road to the seaside was a fairly flat cinder path, with green fields on both sides. Cowherds lazily sat on the backs of cattle, and small bridges spanned flowing streams, all exuding a rural charm. Twenty-five minutes later, we arrived at the seaside.</p>
<p>Everything had changed!</p>
<p>The seaside hotel was reduced to a dilapidated gate, standing lonely in the wind and rain. Entering the gate, there was a large pool of water, surrounded by weeds. The lower floor of the building behind it was still in good condition, perhaps someone lived there, but looking up, the upper floor was empty and dilapidated.</p>
<p>The gate of the seaside bathing resort seemed intact from the outside. Stepping up dozens of stone steps, we could still see the black characters "Takahashi Seaside Bathing Resort," but when we got to the top, we couldn't help but gasp. The front and back walls were gone, and the windows were gone. Only a dozen workers were there, sheltering from the rain, staring at us with curious eyes.</p>
<p>We saw the sea – a vast expanse of yellow seawater. A few sparse trees remained along the coast, swaying in the gentle breeze and drizzle. However, what lay before us was still a large, uneven expanse of muddy ground, filled with puddles and overgrown with weeds. Its slope was very steep, and with the mud made slippery by the rain, I tried several times to cross it, but was too afraid of slipping. Finally, I chose a small path paved with pebbles and detoured to the seaside.</p>
<p>The rain gradually stopped, and soon the sun was shining on us, but we felt an unspeakable disappointment and melancholy in our hearts. The seawall had collapsed. Except for a section along the coast that still existed in its original form, the rest of the large stones were piled up in a mess below, and the wooden stakes had sunk into the water, only exposing a row of heads above the surface. A turbid sea stretched out to the boundless horizon, with no beach and no markers.</p>
<p>Surrounding us was unparalleled tranquility, with only the sound of the tide lapping against the shore, emitting a rhythmic, monotonous sound. In the distance, the sea and sky were connected, with sails dotting the horizon. A passenger ship slowly sailed by, and a wisp of light smoke faintly cut through the clear sky.</p>
<p>We looked around and saw no one. The entire seaside only had the three of us as tourists. Recalling how many beautiful and happy souls had once been intoxicated here, how many laughs and cheerful voices had echoed, who would have thought that it would now be so lonely and desolate!</p>
<p>To commemorate our visit, we still took some photos with the sea as the background. Like a sea change, a sense of loss filled our hearts.</p>
<p>Returning in the twilight, it was as if we had lost something, and we only felt empty. The past was just a dream. What else could this trip be considered besides a memorial service!</p>

<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>In the American book market, there are often entire sets of private collections for sale, among which there are many valuable old books, and the prices are quite expensive. In recent years, due to sluggish sales, the market has been depressed. For example, a copy of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" from 1865, inscribed by the author and gifted to Thomas Penny, was sold for as high as US$15,300 in 1940, but its current market price is US$3,400. Another example is Charles Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" from 1843, with Dickens' inscription, which sold for $450 in 1941, but now sells for $200. The original manuscript of Charles Lamb's play "John Woodvil" sold for $3,600 in 1941, but now sells for $1,400. Washington's 1797 diary sold for $10,000 in 1941, but now sells for $5,200.</p>
<p>The bleak situation in the American book market is due to the scarcity of both buying and selling. People in the book industry, seeing a dark future, are hesitant to move forward. The lack of support for book prices is causing them to decline further. Originally, for the past 75 years, many first editions of British literary works in the New York book market have been more expensive than in London, but now they are cheaper than in London. Commentators say that this may be a temporary phenomenon under Britain's strict foreign exchange control. Once normality is restored, the pricing of the American and British book markets should tend to converge.</p>

<p>— Zhou Chao</p>
<p>There are four kinds of people:</p>
<p>He who knows not, and knows not he knows not: he is a fool – shun him.</p>
<p>He who knows not, and knows he knows not: he is simple – teach him.</p>
<p>He who knows, and knows not he knows: he is asleep – wake him.</p>
<p>He who knows, and knows he knows: he is wise – follow him. (Borden)</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Xu Kuo Garden <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>The Xu Kuo Garden, commonly known as the Zeng Garden, is where Mr. Zeng Mengpu spent his later years in retirement. The garden is located in the west of Changshu, facing the city wall. It covers dozens of acres, with winding artificial mountains and tens of thousands of lotus flowers in the pond. It was formerly my family's "Little Wangchuan" of Imperial Censor Gong (諱岱), for which Tu Long wrote a record. Later, it was abandoned for nearly three hundred years. It was not until Mr. Tui An, the grandfather of Mengpu, (named Xiwen, a juren in the Qing Dynasty, Daoguang gengchen, selected for educational theory.) because of the loss of his second son, Rizhang (字闇谷), that he greatly expanded the construction, building gardens to dispel his sorrow. He had already built the Mingse Villa to the west of his house on the bank of the Xishan Tangjing, for which Li Yueman wrote a record. He then built gardens in Jiuwan Xu, named "Xu Kuo Village Residence", and first completed the "Returning to Farming and Reading Cottage", with the water pavilion to the north called "Idle Talk of Water and Sky".</p>
<p>After the death of Mr. Tui An, his third son, Mr. Junbiao (Mengpu's father, named Zhizuan, a juren in the Guangxu Yi Hai Enke, an official in the Ministry of Justice, with extremely rich writings.) inherited his father's will and announced its completion. For a time, famous scholars flocked to it like startled geese, and people like Li Yueman, Wu Qingqing, and Zhao Huifu all stayed there as guests. The Lu Garden mentioned in Mr. Mengpu's book "A Rude Man" refers to this garden. With its beautiful scenery and flourishing plants and trees, the elders of Yushan can all tell stories of its glory. Later, Mr. Mengpu lived here with his mother, and further added a Western-style building. He also set up tea seats in the summer, inviting tourists, and famous people gave poems as gifts every day. Mr. Mengpu died in this garden. After his death, literary figures from all over the country gathered at "Xiaoyao You" to hold a memorial meeting, and discussed opening a room in this garden for commemoration, and also wanted to carve a bronze statue. Unfortunately, the Japanese invasion soon began, Changshu fell, and this garden was destroyed and never repaired. The collection of books was completely dispersed. The books translated and written by the gentleman, such as "Complete Works of Xiao E, Legend of Yi Xue Tan Dream", "Textual Research on the Art and Literature Records of the Later Han Dynasty", etc., were even sold by the pound; the first edition of the French book "La Dame aux Camélias", known as the only copy in the world, is also unknown. The garden is full of filth and dirt, with everything imaginable. The trees were all cut down, and half of the windows and doors were used as firewood, and half of the roof tiles were also removed, all done by a nephew of Mr. Mengpu. Yang Wuyang, who had returned from the lakes and seas, settled here and planted weeping willows, and wrote a poem: "Ping Zhong's tower sang and the craftsman were expected, the pavilions and corridors were few and far between. The sheep's nephew begged for a villa to reduce the shade, and the willow planter came to add a branch". Mr. Mengpu's virtuous sons, Mr. Xubai and others, have been working hard for the country and have been away from home for a long time, respecting family ties and not bearing to inquire about this. However, those who visit this garden find that the scenery is very different, and everything they see is different, so there is no lack of feelings about the past and the present! The famous gardens of Yushan, such as "Yan Gu", "Hu Yin", "Jing Pu", and "Zhi Yuan", have all been destroyed and blocked since the Japanese invasion, and there is no hope of restoration. The rise and fall of a garden is related to the prosperity and decline of a country. My grandmother was a younger cousin of Mr. Mengpu. When she was young, she spent her days in this garden, witnessing its glory. Every summer and autumn, she would pick lotus flowers and return home. Now that my grandmother has been dead for eleven years, I still visited this garden with my friend, Qi Junshi, and talked about poetry with Mr. Wuyang in "Idle Talk of Water and Sky". Mr. Wuyang gave a poem saying: "The stream bridge is full of Qi Qian, and they go to the water and sky every day". Lingering over the country and the family, I am saddened and difficult to express, and it is not just for the sake of this garden that I feel sad.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Also Talking About Quitting Smoking <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wo</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Dacheng's article on the difficulty of quitting smoking on the 11th, I have the same feeling, so I also come to talk about it.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, many literati quit smoking due to economic pressure. The so-called unstable foundation and shaky life mean that they cannot increase income and can only reduce expenses. It is also very sad to be at the end of the road.</p>
<p>I have been smoking for seventeen years. At first, because of social interactions, I couldn't live without it for a day, especially when it came to reciprocity. Gradually, it became a habit, and I found many reasons for myself, such as a cigarette after a meal makes you feel like an immortal, it's a prevention against epidemics in the carriage, and it's a pleasure to read the newspaper while smoking... There are many reasons, too many to list. Later, whether it was grading papers, attending meetings, writing drafts, or drawing comics, it was always appropriate and necessary. If I was empty-handed, my heart would shake, and even going out to buy cigarettes in the middle of the night could not be said to be making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p>Recently, my income has been limited and my expenses have been endless, so I decided to quit. It has been seven days. At first, I gritted my teeth and it wasn't a problem. When people came to offer me cigarettes, I refused them all, even when an apprentice from the barber shop handed me one, I smiled and declined. I didn't destroy the ashtray and cigarette case (the reason is that I have quit many times in my life, and I have often lost some things in vain, and it doesn't take long to start again). However, I face them morning and night, and I am touched by the scene. My heart itched after three days, and after five days, I accepted two cigarettes at a banquet. Now it has been seven days! At this time, coming out of a hospital after visiting a patient, the cigarette stand seemed to be deliberately provoking me. I finally succumbed, and my "determination" vanished before my eyes. I hurriedly struck a match, looked up at the sky, took a long puff, and suddenly felt that the world had returned to beauty, and was no longer so lazy and lacking in energy. Strange! The feeling of drowsiness that I had felt for the past few days almost disappeared immediately; the cigarette prices that I had been afraid to see but wanted to see for the past few days were as familiar as if I had memorized Tang poems.</p>
<p>When I got to my wife, I heard these words again: "I told you not to quit. Wouldn't it be okay to smoke less? You are really something!"</p>
<p>So I lit a second cigarette and smoked it boldly, but smiled cowardly. She couldn't help but get a very pitiful and shameful impression of me, but what method did I have to eliminate this impression invisibly?</p>
<p>The economic foundation is still not solid, and the problem is still the problem. After considering the fifth cigarette, I decided (it's coming again!) to "stop" at this limit every day. What a ridiculous limit!</p>
<h3 id="e145">Lin's Translation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>In Lin Yutang's book "Moment in Peking", many Chinese words are transliterated. "Lao ye" and "Xiao jie", like the English words "amah" and "taren", are not surprising. "Jie jie" and "Yi ma" have no other way to be translated besides transliteration. As for "Zong zi" and "Zan men", both nouns and pronouns can be transliterated. As for "Tong jia peng you", "Tian sheng you wu", "peng you" and "tian sheng" are in English, and "tong jia" and "you wu" are in Chinese. However, "帮" in "Qing bang" is written as "Gangs", which I am afraid the people in that gang would not want to accept. This word has two meanings, one is "a group of workers or slaves or prisoners", and the other is "a combination of like-minded people, especially those who engage in illegal activities". Lin likes the Oxford Dictionary, so he cites it as above. If we look at the first meaning of this word in the American Webster's Dictionary, it is still good, only saying that it is "a group of people" combined for a special purpose, and Lin must have taken this meaning. Also, "Wang ba", "Wang guo nu", and "Yi liao bu de" are all in Chinese. It is truly new and strange to have these words in an English book. English already has "Kowtow", and now it has "Ding hao". I wonder when the English and Americans will start to adopt Lin's words into their dictionaries.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Fighting <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>The famous historian Lorid Lewis took his nine-year-old daughter Nancy to see military exercises.</p>
<p>The child asked, "Father, why are those people walking around together?"</p>
<p>"They are training, preparing to go to war when they are well trained," Lewis said.</p>
<p>The child didn't understand. She said, "Fighting? Father, what is 'fighting'?"</p>
<p>Lewis said: "This matter is not easy to explain. Many people put on uniforms, like these soldiers; in another country, many people also put on uniforms. Everyone takes guns and cannons to a certain place and kills each other, which is called fighting."</p>
<p>Nancy was silent for a while. She said, "Father, do you know what? One day something will happen."</p>
<p>Lewis asked, "What will happen?"</p>
<p>Nancy said, "Well, let me tell you. One day, even if some people want to fight, no one will be willing to fight." (Translated from the Christian Proverb Newspaper)</p>

<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>Thinking of Chengdu in the Summer (Part 1)</p>
<p>In the summer, those who have surplus in life often move their families to a cool place, called "avoiding the summer heat", and they especially praise Guling and Moqian. In fact, places deep in the mountains and forests, based on natural conditions, must have low temperatures. Which mountain is not like that? Why must it be Guling and Moqian?</p>
<p>Avoiding the summer heat by staying far from the city is no different from disconnecting from real life, which I suspect is not the best method. Therefore, I think of Chengdu.</p>
<p>In Chengdu in the summer, the highest Fahrenheit reading is over ninety degrees. I have lived there for two summers, and I still think about it endlessly. Speakers often say that the summer scenery in Chengdu is most similar to that in Beijing, but that is not entirely true. Beijing has high skies and no clouds. At noon, the sun scorches people like roasting, and the rainfall is sparse. If there are several consecutive days of clear and dry weather, the Fahrenheit reading will exceed one hundred degrees. Chengdu, on the other hand, has an average temperature without great extremes, low evaporation, and frequent rain. After the rain, it is easy to wear autumn clothes and walk along the riverbank. Its charm is hardly less than "the dusk of the Hanpo Estuary."</p>
<p>Beijing has a population of as many as 1.8 million, while Chengdu is only about four-tenths of that. Also, because of the different economic systems, Chengdu is a self-sufficient agricultural city, and the "percentage" of the poor is relatively small; Beijing is neither an industrial city nor an agricultural city, nor is it a political city. The vast majority of residents need to run around and gasp for breath, fighting for the daily necessities of life in the market. Therefore, the folk customs of the two places are one restless and one tranquil, and what is manifested in the summer is particularly profound. In the market of Beijing, the hotter the weather, the more the cries of the ice cream vendors feel sad; this is something that Chengdu does not have. I once spent half a summer in Chengdu Jing'an Villa. Outside the door was the bustling market, but it was like living in a monk's room in Wenshu Monastery, with a quiet and peaceful feeling.</p>
