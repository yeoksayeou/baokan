<p>〔本報南京七日電〕行憲首屆立法院委員報到總數，迄七日晚十時止達三百七十人，超出法定人數代表總額五分之一多多。孫科，吳鐵城，陳立夫，賴　等亦均報到。八日合法集會，殆決不致爲其他因素所影響。開幕式定晨十時舉行，集會籌備處已分別向各報到委員發出通知，並假報端刋露公吿，國民政府首長多人及首都外交使節，亦將應邀列席觀禮。記者座位設於樓上，選舊立法院旁聽證或臨時出入證入席，委員亦須佩帶臨時出席證進出。備處於會塲之接收靑查及守衛，已嚴密注意，故集會前並無任何意外麻煩。</p>
<p>〔本報南京日電〕行憲第一屆立法院，決於八日上午十時假國民大會堂自行集會，宣告正式成立，集會開幕典禮之秩序爲：（一）典禮開始，（二）全體肅立，（三）主席就位（先推選臨時主席），（四）奏樂，（五）唱國歌，（六）向國旗及國父遺像行三鞠躬禮，（七）主席報告，（八）國民政府主席致詞，（九）來賓致詞，（十）奏樂，（十一）禮成，（十二）謁陵。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕立院副院長候選人，前經國民黨中央提名陳立後，一部份國民黨籍立委表示意見，其所持之見解乃在副院長均南方人，將失卻地域上制平衡性，故有黃宇人等推　傅斯年出任，但中央認爲此事業經確定，不便更易，當決以監察院長仍請于右任氏担任，副院長亦仍由劉哲氏出任，則南方人主特立院，北方人主特監院，當仍可獲得南北平衡之效。另新閣人選由張羣繼長之說，迄至七日晚止，業已確定，何應欽氏則專主軍事。</p>
<p>「本報南京七日電〕行憲立院集會前夕，民。靑兩黨復以兩黨立委當選名額問題發生波折，國民黨方面亟欲謀得補救辦法，使兩黨提名未獲當選之人士得參加政府行政部門工作，繼續合乍。七日由張羣，雷震等分別奔走，謀轉團之途徑。晚九時張於政院官邸邀國民黨人士陳立夫，雷震等商談對民·青兩黨立委候選人，解決辦法，至十一時由雷氏首訪民社黨徐傳霖，蔣勻田，談廿分鐘後，訪青年黨左舜生，惟尚未至最後階段，國民黨方面正竭力就立委名額部份設法，同時對兩萬在行政方面之合作，尤盼能予繼續，故此項折衝雖已臨集會前夕，　尚在進行之中。</p>

<h3 id="c2">美國會多數議員　均主張積極援華　陳納德談返美作證經過 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕飛虎將軍陳納德於前日偕夫人陳香梅女士由美返滬，昨日上午十時在外灘民航空運大隊招待記者，報吿渠此次返美向衆院外交委會提供美援華意見之經過，並答覆記者所詢各項問題。</p>
<p>據陳將軍談，當其在外交委會作證後，多數國會議員均贊成其意見，即認為美援華款項應較四億六千三百萬元之數更多。陳氏又稱，渠曾與魏德邁將軍，麥克阿瑟將軍及蒲立特等私人討論援華事，彼等均支特援華，並主張不僅經濟援華，且當軍事援華。但從未聞及馬歇爾將軍贊成援華之說。至陳將軍之意見發表後，在美一般反應均極良好。記者詢以美援以後是否可能繼續增加？陳將軍客謂，余相是可能的，余不信此批款項即是最後一次。但增加援華款項必須有新的議案在國會中通過。目前渠尚未聞有人擬提出關於此事之議案。</p>
<p>關於新任對華經濟合作團長賴普漢氏，陳將軍稱渠深知賴氏資望，認為足以勝任此職，尤因渠對於遠東問題極有研究，實為一種優秀之人選。但陳氏在美始終未聞此事，直至抵滬後始悉。陳氏表示援華款項應作善後復興之用，如修築粵漢鐵路，復興工業等，但應在黄河下游區內。陳將軍對於我國改革幣制一點亦認為可爲，並謂在華盛頓時，有人提議美國以白銀六億兩貸華以作此用。但此項議案尚須在國會中正式提出，將來是否能通過，不能預測。提及馮玉祥在美情形，陳氏吿稱，其在美毫無地位，一般有地位之美國人七從不注意此人，亦極少人與之往來。至美國一般人民對於中國情形不甚感覺興趣，亦缺乏認識。但彼等對於共產黨皆竭力主張排斥。美國報紙刋載中國情形之消息甚少，以紐約時報之言論為最同情中國。又美國人民對於中國政府腐敗官吏貪汚印象頗深，其實彼等所得消息常不正確。陳氏本人認為貪官極少。而有甚多賢明長官美人均不悉。問以何人為中國最能辦事之行政長官？陳氏笑曰，余所接觸之能辦事長官極多，但說何人最能幹，則無從答覆。陳將軍復答某記者所詢，謂渠不主張美國軍隊加入國軍與共軍作戰，除非係屬必要。但美政府極願帮助中國，派員訓練國軍。渠又認爲國軍在戰略上之要點以前應以瀋陽為最，目前情形不知。陳氏最後並稱，美國本身經濟情况亦甚困難，現今負債已達二千六百億美元（包括公債等），國內稅捐極高。有外籍記者當即問其美國應否犧牲本國軍費以之援華，陳氏答以「否」字，美國應一方面訓練本身軍隊，而同時將其費用撥一部份分援助歐洲及中國。</p>

<h3 id="c24">首屆立法院自行集會 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>民選的首屆立法院今晨在首都自行集會了，這是我國政治跨開大步走上民主憲政的又一步驟。因為首屆行憲的國大選出了總統副總統就算完成了它的基本任務，於五月一日閉幕，而民選政府的組成，尚有待總統提出行政院長的人選，徵求立法院的同意，然後始能由新任行政院長組成面目一新的民選政府，與民更始；從此以後，不論是關於內政外交的決策，或是中央地方的制度，都要依照新憲法的規定而實施；同時行政院採取任何措置，都要向立法院負其責任；所以首屆立法院今天在首都自行集會，在我國民主憲政史上，實為一劃時代的轉捩點，今天全國四億五千萬同胞，都翹首瞭望着首都，期待新政治新政風的展開，莫不懷着愉快的心情，祝首屆立法院自行集會的成功。我們極願乘此時機，一述我們對於首屆立法院的願望。</p>
<p>第一，今天自行集會的首屆立法院，與過去立法院的性質，是截然不同的，不僅所有立法委員均出自民選，而且立法院在憲法上乘有祟高的權力，總統任命行政院長旣要徵得立法院的同意，政院對於國家重要決策也要向立法院負責，故共地位相當於採取責任內閣制各國的衆議院。而我國民主政治尚在學習的階段，代表人民行使立法權的立法委員所負責任自然格外重大，尤其在今日戡亂期間，政治，經濟，軍事曁社會的危機日益深刻，對於行政院的施政方針，更應從大處着眼，切勿可夾難絲毫的意氣與私見，在立法院內興風作浪，使政局動蘯不定，加深當前的危機。</p>
<p>第二，民主憲政的精義，首重法治精神，在民主政治之下，不論是政府或是人民的一舉一動，都要以國家的根本大法（憲法）以及一切普通法律爲準繼。我國憲法一百七十五條，為全國上下所共知，簡單明瞭，自可爲全國朝野一致遵行的法典；但是普通法律，自國民政府設立立法院以來，不知制定了多少法律，不要說我們老百姓犒不淸楚，就是立法者與執行法律者，也不知究有多少種，有的朝行夕改，有的有名無實，等於具文，根本失去了立法的意義。其實法律不在多，而貴於切實易行，所以我們希望首屆立法院要本着「簡化法律」的精神，整理過去立法院所制定的法律，應剔除的要加以剔除，應合併的要加以合併，務使老百姓對於國家法律一目瞭然，知有所遵循；但若立法院認為有增訂新法律的必要，也應該注意其是否切實易行，好敎政府與人民共同遵守，以貫澈立法的精神。</p>
<p>第三，憲政學者一致承認，民主政治就是民意政治，立法委員均出自民選，代表人民行使立法權，可謂來自民間，深知民間的疾苦；扒是我們仍希望來自民問的立法委員能常在民問，庶不致與人民脫節。依照英美民主先進各國的先例，在衆議院中設有各種調查委員會，對於某種特殊問題，必須先調查淸楚，然後再付諸討論；同時還有民意測驗所之類的組織，每遇有重大問題發生時，必先徵求民意，以知其向背，然後決定自己應採取的熊度。所以我們希望立法院自行集會之後，在院內應多設各種調查委員會及民意測驗所；各位民選的立委，除經常在京開會而外，尤應當到民問，探求民意，作為發言立論的根據。</p>
<p>最後，關於立委選舉糾紛問題，民靑兩黨已在立法院自行集會的前夕發表聯合聲明，一方面表示反對中央的最後決定，以得票多者當選；另一方面又鄭重聲明，此一問題若不能謀得合理解決，則民靑兩黨將不出席立法院。看情勢，立悉選舉糾紛問題又將引起政治上的風波，使我們不能不認為遺憾。保證名額原屬政治性質，在法律上旣無根據，在人情也講不通，任何一國的政黨決不能强調選民投某一政黨候選人一票，不過國民黨旣然提供諾言前，為道義計，也應該多讓民靑兩黨的候選人當選。政務會議決議增加名額，原是一種補救辦法，可惜未為立法院所採納，同時民靑兩黨也不甚贊成。這一個事實上的困難，民靑兩黨也應該體諒政府的應付不易，現在政府決定循着法律的途徑，謀得合理的解決，民靑兩黨自無反對的理由。　社　主席張君勱氏對於副總統選舉問題發表談話，也曾談到法治的可貴，他說：「所謂法律，猶匠人之有規矩，憑之成方圓，不能絲毫夾難情感意氣，要有以法律懸諸國門不能易一字之精神，若憑一己之好惡，任意上下其手，不足以言法治。』民靑兩黨於四月廿六日發表聯合聲明，也以「維護憲法之尊嚴？為無可旁貨之天職」為言。所以立委選舉糾紛問題，唯有從立委選罷法裏求得合理解決。民靑兩黨千萬不可趨於極端，以「退出立法院」為要挾。好在立法院是國家的最高立法機關，自可在法理的範圍以內，修改立委選罷法，或增加立委名額，或在補缺選舉時另立補救辦法，均無不可。首屆立法院因時機的迫切，依法非於今天自行集會不可，我們希望民靑兩然的當選立委，均能同時參加，而把這個問題，留待新立法院從長計識，在法律上謀得合理解決。再觀於國大代表選舉糾紛所獲得的敎訓，强令得票多者退讓，必然引起意外的糾紛，而對於問題的本身仍無法謀得合理的解決。我們應該特別重視這個教訓。</p>

<p>高欄決賽　男子十高欄決賽，毫無意外，預賽成績最佳之馬華黄兩正，複賽決賽，同為十六秒正，均破林紹洲十六秒二之大會紀錄。跨欄姿勢美妙，步法正確而富有彈力，成績較預賽大爲‘進步。第二北平徐寳臣相差僅半欄，成績當亦甚作。馬華陳進吉第三，台灣賴有德第四，上海李震中後勁不足，得第五名，廣東孫鈞列第六。高欄決賽，亦為昨日成績佳美之一項。</p>
<p>千五公尺異程接力決賽　千五異　接力決賽，台灣又獨佔鰲頭，接刀給分，加倍計算，台灣頻添十四分，聲勢更形浩大，上海隊努力奮鬥，　第二名，落後約十公尺。八隊參加決賽、第一棒海軍王競武一馬當先，上海談淸，台灣許通，追隨於後，第二棒上海容承彪，脫願而出，其次為台灣張星賢，海軍王德智，及第三棒四百公尺，台灣陳文炎超出上海林燦然，距離漸遠，海軍張之淸仍居第三。最後一棒八百公尺，台灣大將陳英郞，疾馳而去，大勢已完，上海吳仲海遠非其敵，落後十五公尺，得第二名，第三海軍，第四甘肅，第五警察第六空軍，成績三分三十四秒五分之三。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕女子跳高決賽，於昨日下午二時許，開始舉行。實際出塲參加預賽者，共廿七名，角逐將近尾聲時，忽大雨傾盆而下，半小時後，雨勢漸煞，繼續舉行，結果不出本報昨日所料，河北吳樹森，以一米四〇之優異成績，打破朱天眞所保持之一米三五五全國舊紀錄，奪得冠軍。第二名粵穗黄藏平，亦以一米三三，刷新唐瑞容所保持之一米三二〇大會舊紀錄。雨天中有此優異成績，誠屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>昨日女跳高，自一九二〇米起跳，個個輕便跳過，其後逐步加高至一米二七，能跳過者不足十人。復加高至一米三〇，吳樹森·黄藏平·王鴻蘭·均一跳而過。林振基·陳瀛振·兩跳始過。邱月嬌三跳未過，乃屈居六名中之末座。橫竿加高至一米三三時，僅吳樹森·黄藏平二人從容跳過，餘子均先後失格。加至一米三六時，吳樹森仍一跳即過，惟黄藏平三跳未過，即吿失格。此時僅存吳樹森一人跳成績。橫竿再加至一米四〇時，逆風細雨，吳樹森兩跳未渦，最後拼足吃奶氣力，一跳而過，此跳離橫竿尚有若干距離。再加至一米四二時，吳樹森二跳未過，三跳時已奔至橫竿相近，大致因步數失誤，故衝到後，又未起跳，乃以一米四〇作最高成績。昨日女跳高，除首二名外，第三，第四，第五名成續，均屬一米三〇。結果以各人跳過次數多寡，而計算位次。第四名南京林振基，短小精悍，跳時採用西方之滾式過竿，　勢準確美觀，惜跳至一米二四時，臀部不愼跌傷，致最高成續僅止於一米三〇。假以時日前途正未可限量。茲探結前六名名次成績如次：</p>
<p>第一名　吳樹森（冀）一米四〇（破全國紀錄）</p>
<p>第二名　黄藏平（粵）一米三三（破大會紀錄。）</p>
<p>第三名　王鴻關（靑）一米三〇</p>
<p>第四名　林振基（京）一米三〇</p>
<p>第五名　陳瀛振（滬）一米三〇</p>
<p>第六名　邱月嬌（臺）一米二七</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕男子田賽，昨有標槍跳遠兩項決賽。標槍於三時起賽，跳遠於三時四十分起賽，惟賽至中途，均因雨停土。標槍數擲經過，竟無人出五十米關。出四十米者，亦不過六七人。其中以空軍之王瑞，較佔優勢，約有四十六米之成績。海軍王學武，腰傷未　，成績難期振作。渠稱：近因疏於練習，而大會所用之標槍，槍竿太軟，影饗成績尤鉅。海軍王瑞，對槍竿太軟，亦有同感。王瑞身高力大，現年僅蕙五歲，渠標槍有五十一米二之成績，惟渠以昨日下午，天氣陰曇，亦足影響渠眞正之成績。</p>

<p>〔本報訊」昨為足球賽第三日，上午田徑場與逸園各有兩場，下午逸園兩場。結果香港以二比一挫海軍，浙江以二比一勝空軍，大連三對一擊敗廣東，陸軍七對〇輕取貴州，馬華以五比一勝南京，上海則以三比一退湖北。其中除大連特別賣力，竟在延長時間內壓倒廣東外，其餘均不出本報昨日之預料。昨上午氣候甚佳，會塲與逸園觀衆甚多，惟下午四時後忽降驟雨，陸軍與貴州兩隊即在大雨中完成會戰。至廣東對大連一役，曾因下半時之時間縮短問題，大連向裁判張樂提出頁問，指為徧袒廣東，經解釋後糾紛旋即平息。</p>
<p>足球廿一隊人馬，經三日來之激戰，已有十三隊自今日起陸續轉入落選賽。錦標賽中之最後八隊為：馬華，陸軍，大連，上海，香港，浙江，暹華，警察。明日起即將分四組會師，決奪最後四名。</p>

<p>香港對海軍一塲，為昨足球賽中最精彩之節目。雙方實力堅强，踢來緊張萬分。九時正開球後未逾兩分鐘，海軍隊謝錦川即一脚射中，打破港門，港隊曾以三對一擊敗世運代表隊，英名甚感，不料開塲即居下風，乃奮力反攻，兩隊來回惡戰，海軍隊强遠智，經桂林俱負傷下塲，但仍堅强抗守，上半時港隊毫無所獲，下半時兩隊擊戰更酣，港隊在終塲前兩分鐘，左翼李碩友中綫輕輕一蹴，球竟慢慢滾入網中，造成和局。延長時間後，港隊得一角球機會，李碩友挑與鐘燦光，頭頂破的，港隊後來居上，反以二對一力挫海軍。</p>

<p>浙江對空軍一塲於十一時開始，兩方勢均力敵，戰况亦緊張異常。上半時浙隊吳炳浩射中一球，下半時浙隊張傑又進一只，空軍雖曾回敬一球，但終以一球之差敗績。距終塲後之瞬間，空軍隊忍紛起追擊浙隊球員，浙隊中鋒陸炳生當被毆重傷，經急送市立第四醫院醫治，迄晚仍在診療中。浙隊隊員以無端被辱，極為憤慨。擬羣起向空軍隊理論，看台上觀衆亦鼓嗓吶喊，一時秩序大亂，幸經空軍總隊領隊胡偉克，警衛組及時趕到排解，雙方始轉向塲外交涉。</p>

<p>馬華對南京之戰，九時正於逸園展開。南京隊以中大健兒為主體，而輔以金大及首都諸强旅好手，衛綫尚佳，中綫及鋒綫則過軟弱。馬華集南海精英，雖台柱星散，實力巳不若前番征滬時雄厚，然尚非首都設將之所能敵。戰幕揭起後，混戰至廿分鐘，李司達踢起一腳，將球送入綱底，一比〇馬華先開紀録。廿五分鐘，南京胡志綏在陲弔中，郭秉嚴候個正着。頂上開花，扳成平手，上半時一比一。</p>

<p>上海戰湖北，十時半開始。上半塲〇比〇，汽水過後，林根離防遠出，竟被計海滔乘虛直入，先拔頭　，上海忘命反攻，幼良右路輕傳龍海，龍海挑交阿孫，鐵腿起處，　門為破，追成平手。滬軍士氣大掁，三分鐘內連得二球，平反敗局。第廿七分，龍海破關直人，范希文擺下絆馬索，觸犯天條，被罰十二碼。李垚執法，自是脚起球入，終塲滬隊即以三比一勝。</p>
<p>大連擊敗廣州</p>

<p>女子跳高破全國紀錄之吳樹森及其姿勢（本報攝）</p>
<h3 id="c113">女子跳高四名手　冠軍吳樹林每天練跑　亞軍黃藏平摔倒直追第三王鴻蘭秀麗文雅　第四林振基臀不碰竿 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　洪絮才</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕昨日女子跳高北平奧樹森，打破了全國紀錄，粵穗黄藏平，打破了大會紀錄，都是不可得的人材。冠軍吳樹森，自小生長北平，現在北平師範學院體育系一年級　業。據稱運動項目中，最喜歡跳高。過去的成續，是一米三六半，得北平先農壇體育塲決選時冠軍。這次參加全運，達一米四〇，實已創個人新紀錄。她每天淸早必練五十公尺速度短矩離跑步，目的在於增加彈力，數年以來，從不間斷，則今日驚人的成績，決不是輕易獲得的。決饗中輪到她跳高時，態度非常鎭靜，跑步極緩慢，待到架前，縱身一躍，輕鬆地跳過了。吳小姐芳齡二十，長得較一般為高，裝飾擈素，架着一副近視眼鏡，恐怕還是個用功的好學生呢！</p>
<p>亞軍黄藏平，適中身材，瓜子臉型，小腿極為發達，外貌伶俐過人。除參加跳高榮　亞軍外，還參加了女子低欄競賽。昨天起跳時，黄小姐連度特快，一路領先，滿以為可望得分，不幸於跳最後一欄時，不愼摔倒，趕緊起來直追，可惜已經晚了一步，黄小姐只好再等下次機會重新來過了。</p>
<p>跳高第三名王鴻蘭，二九年華，瘦長個子，梳着兩根小辮兒秀麗文雅。她是靑島文德女中的高材生，這還是第一次到上海來。據談跳高到現在，還不過一年的歷史，一共參加過兩次全市運動會，那是由於敎師的慫恿，第一次出馬，獲得第三名，於是對跳高發生了興趣，第二次參加時，便榮勝冠軍。看樣子，王小姐是相當有天才的，如能假以時日，努力訓練，不難創造更光輝的成績。</p>
<p>値得一提的是屈居第四名的南京選手林振基，年紀最輕，個子最矮，但是跳高姿態絕佳。身輕如燕，每一次跳過竿架後，便滾倒在沙坑裏，其臀部決不碰竿，顯係受過基本訓練的。林振基完全男孩子打扮，短褲襯衫之外，戴上紅白相間西瓜皮型壓髮帽一頂。在有一次跳高時，全身越瘦，單留那頂小帽兒在竿架上　動，引得滿塲大笑。林振基不巧當跳過一米二四時，小腿突吿曲筋，但搽此松油，略加按摩後，繼續再跳。不幸又因沙坑過，竟摔倒沙坑外硬地上，致臀部受傷、半天爬不起來，由童子軍擔架隊抬出塲外就治。她的最高紀錄，就到一米三〇為止了。林板基年輕力壯，動作上軌道，只要能不斷訓練，前途正未可限量。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕女子排球賽參加者共九個單位，昨日複賽結果，巳產生最後四名，為上海，台灣，湖南，廣州。四隊將於九日起舉行循環賽，決定第一二三四名。昨日之戰，江西棄權，上海不戰而勝；其他三塲，湖南克浙江，臺灣取靑島，廣州挫河南。</p>
<p>湘女驃悍大捷</p>
<p>湘浙兩隊娘十軍於昨晨儿時展開搏鬥，湘隊大捷，比數二對零　輪實力，湘浙兩隊相差尚不懸殊，只因湘隊前挑擁有猛將鄭培坤，殺球扣球　　　手，且善於乘虛攻弱，而浙隊前排鎖網乏人，第二排疲於奔命，形成挨打　勢，年局中因此而喪失之分數，達十分以上，此為浙隊　致命傷。一局之比數為：廿一比十二，廿一比十。</p>
<p>友誼賽一插曲</p>
<p>湖南·浙江之虎完畢，上海隊邀浙江隊作友誼賽一塲，籍資觀摩。臺灣隊全體隊員亦蒞場參觀。第一局結果為廿一比十二，上海勝。旋浙江隊要求終止比賽，此一幕女排友誼觀戰賽　吿一段落。</p>
<p>臺灣勝來不易</p>
<p>前日一戰而克安東之台灣女兒軍，昨下午以二比一再勝靑島。戰幕揭開，雙方均以志在必勝之信心，英勇出擊，實為昨日最熱烈緊張之一幕排球決鬥。臺灣固善取攻勢，而青島並非坐而挨打，每一球員均發揮最大戰鬥力，奈以出師不利而靠敗北。其比數為：十八對廿一，廿一對九，廿一比五。</p>
<p>粵豫拼命交鋒</p>
<p>廣州對河南之役，前者以二比〇致勝。廣州原可穗操左券，惟演出失常，故賽情驚險萬分。兩局比數爲廿一比十九，廿一比十八。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全運會七日籃球賽已入第三週賽，聯勤勝香港，上海勝廣東，瀋陽勝南京，天津勝江蘇，空軍勝貴州，內以空軍興貴州前半塲至為精采。昨日尚有菲律濱對陸軍，馬華對海軍，福建對警察，均為堅强之戰鬥，惜以大雨滂沱，中途祇得改至今日續賽。</p>
<p>聯勤勝香港</p>
<p>上午九時舉行，香港李卓民首開紀錄，即為聯勤曹志吉追上，卜彥适又加兩分，廖滌航錦上添花，成六比二，以後一路領先，銳不可當，香港亦不示弱，始終沉着應變。此役聯勤採五人聯防打法，王士選為全隊靈魂，賈志軍專事傳球與前鋒投籃，合作精神實為各隊少有。該隊打法已煥然一新，必要時也有假動作，惟較上海隊為少。香港採區域防衛制，亦頗不弱，但因聯勤動作迅速敝捷，又加氣力充沛，自非敵手。香港張樹榮投籃較準，昨戰渠一人即投入十六分，終以聯勤快速度切入，故以五十八對卅六，香港敗北。</p>

<p>上海勝廣東</p>
<p>上午九時，在第六球塲舉行。上海以大李·文華·成章·松圓·迎科·五人上塲，成章兩罰俱中，趙斌擲中，二比二平手。連科·震中·先後破籃，上海遂脫穎而出，廣東投籃欠準，高空遠傳又盡被上海截獲，上海控制兩隻籃下球，十二比二後，廣束乘對手氣力不加，投中數球，前半結束，上海以二十三比十佔優。下半時，上海全部人員出場，發動車輪大戰，廣東隊趁勢急起直追，迫成三十一比二十二，上海復以最理想陣容出戰，文華·成章·松圓·運用巧妙之傳遞，分數又扶搖直上，終場爲五十八三十二。</p>
<p>瀋陽勝南京</p>
<p>十時在原塲地舉行，南京先盛後袞，上半佔先六分，以長力不繼，下半時瀋陽藉體力之優勢，運用排球式之派傳，收獲頗多，旋即超出南京，結果為五十九此四十二。上半時二十五比十九，南京領前。瀋陽於下半時，竟連奪四十分之多，遂吿反敗為勝。</p>
<p>天津勝江蘇</p>
<p>下午三時舉行。天津於對浙江之役，未見表演其生動之才能，今日對江蘇發揮得淋漓盡緻，成一面倒之局，以七十二對廿六大勝。</p>
<p>空軍勝貴州</p>
<p>下午三時舉行，空軍貴州兩隊，均以力氣硬打作賭注，貴州　時，　分，後衛犯規則判罰，空軍罰分兩次，以後即角逐甚烈。貴州隊長郭建東眼角負傷流血出塲，易以宋建中，宋以快速姿能　與前鋒，擲未中的，宋追至躍起一彈，球已落網，引得滿塲堂聲。斯時空軍强烈攻勢開始，而貴州亦稱驍勇，不屈不撓，頑强抵抗。惟以貴州體力不及空軍，於下半塲最後之十分鐘內，頻頻失城，致遭六十八對川九之挫欺。查此戰貴州個人技術均臻上乘，惟不講求戰略戰術，亦為失敗之主因。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行與輸出入管理委員會昨通吿指　銀行，對　進口結匯辦法，略有　改。記者特趨訪負責當局，據云過去　進口，　　　進口許可證以後，即可按照當時牌價結購外匯。但進口物品到達後之售價，並非按照匯率成本，而大都超過黑市匯率。最近黑市　價暴漲，遠超過一般物價之上，至不合理。進口貨價迫隨黑市之情形，勢所難免。今為减除此種不合理現象起見，進口商人於接到允許進口許可證之通知時，先按照當時匯率折合國幣，交納百分之五十之保證金。於貨物到達時，再結外匯。但爲取信外商計，得先由中央銀行以外匯貸與指定銀行，其數額不得超過所繳納之保證金。　指定銀行尚欲借取更多之外匯，亦可付給，但須補足保證金之數。此舉完全為　進貨物　市塲銷售之價格，與進貨成本相較，不至相差過遠，以期利益分配之公允。日前報　指定銀行建議改革外匯制度，送交貝祖詒氏，種種傳聞。徵之此次進口結匯辦法之修改，更可證明與事實不符云。中央銀行業務局與輸出入管理委員會昨以　一三一號通兩致　旨　銀行，關於輸入許可證結匯辦法，通知各行照下列規定，即日實施：</p>
<p>（一）進口商當接到輸出入管理委員會通知該商之申請書業經核准發給輸入許可證時，須即將該許可證之外匯數額百分之五十，按當日之市價，折合國幣，繳存中央銀行。此項存款可作指定銀行所開具之信用狀或委託購買證項下之定金。</p>
<p>（二）進口商憑以提供繳存中央銀行之正式存款收據，向輸出入管理委負會領取輸入許可證。</p>
<p>（三）自本年五月七日及以後所發之輸入許可證，指定銀行於結售許可證項下之外匯與進口商時，須繳騐有關貨物業已運抵本國口岸之證件，始予照結外匯。</p>
<p>（四）中央銀行對於指定銀行將給予外匯貸款，以支付指定銀行所發信用狀及（或）委託購買證項下之匯票。其數額以所繳國幣存款照貸款日所値之數為度。如指定銀行需要較己繳存國幣數値更多之外匯時，得增加繳存國幣，按照增加貸款日之市價計算。</p>
<p>（五）中央銀行之外匯貸款，祗貸與有關之指定銀行，並由該行負完全責任。</p>

<p>（一）聖敎十二時　二卷　伯二九一八　二七三四</p>

<p>（十）十二時普勸四衆依敎修行　四卷　伯仁七一四　二〇五四　三二八六　三〇八七</p>
<p>請先試言一日分爲十二時，和十二時配十二支與配「夜半」「鷄鳴」等十二名稱的由來。</p>
<p>把一日一夜分成十二時，比把一夜分成五更的時代不應該晚。把一日一夜分成了十二時，就用十二支的名字來代表他們，也是一件很自然的事情。這件事情的起源，茲假定是在西漢，大致不曾錯誤的。至於把「夜半」「鷄鳴」十二名稱與十二支名配合來記十二時，在西漢的時代，好像還沒有確定出一個系統來，不過各自獨立使用，來代表片斷的時間。就顧炎武日知錄卷二十「古無一日分爲十二時」一條所舉的例子，可以知道在先秦和西漢的時候，非常紊亂。如顧氏所舉的易和春秋有「日中」，詩則有「日之方中」；春秋有「鷄鳴」，詩經有「會朝」，禮又有「昧爽」，「質明」，「朝時」，「晏朝」和「鷄初鳴」。淮南子天文訓述說日出到日沒，太陽經過十五個地方，映出了十五個時辰，——從「晨明」到「定昏」，很顯明的沒有把「夜半」和與夜半相鄰的時辰算入。所以淮南子的十五時，不能代表一個整天。不過他把紊亂的名稱，依據太陽的運轉排出一個次序來，實在是第一次大整理。</p>
<p>淮南子和他同時代的著述裏，好像都沒有把十二支名和「夜半」「鷄鳴」等十二時名配合使用的，因爲在那時候，十二時名還沒有確定，也沒有排定；可是他們的排定與確定，大概就在西漢末年。王充論衡卷二十三　時篇已經說：</p>
<p>「一日之中分爲十二時，平旦寅，日出卯也。」在王充（二七——）以前，十二支名和十二時名是顯然的曾經配合運用，而且已經把次序排定確定了！杜預（一三二—二八四）生在王充的兩百年以後，以社會上久已通用了的十二時來註左氏昭公五年傳文裏的「十時」，自然要柄緊不相合了！</p>
<p>自從有了這樣形式的確定和通行，纔能有十二時歌產生的可能！</p>
<p>又在杜預的兩百年以後，王融（四六八—四九六）作了法樂辭十二章，講說悉達太子一生的事蹟，正和敎煌本聖敎十二時的體裁和故事一樣。所以我說王融的法樂辭，已經有了十二時的風格，只是沒有十二時的標題。那十二韋法樂辭載在廣弘明集卷三十上。</p>
<p>王融稍後，有寳誌和尙的十二時頌。十二時頌的最早出處是景德傳燈錄卷二十九。明代臧懋循詩所卷五十六，仰山乘卷二並有轉載，題作「十二時歌」。誌公的時代，可能已經有了十二時歌在傳唱，但這個十二時歌，一不見朱代以前書裏稱引過；二誌公時代不會有三三七式的歌辭，也不會有這樣好的白話；三誌公的年歲比菩提達摩略長一點，不應該反歌頌達摩以後的禪學。因此我疑猜傳燈錄裏題名寳誌的那篇十二時有點靠不住。但我自己對於佛學是外行，所以向周一良先生去請敎。周先生覆了我一封長信，說傳燈錄裏的誌公十二時是僞託的，並且說明何以要偽託誌公的原因。我又向胡適之先生請敎，胡先生也以爲不眞，又舉出了一些晚出的證據。</p>
<p>隋書卷十五音樂志下云：</p>
<p>「煬帝不解音律，略不關懷。後大製豓篇，辭極淫綺。令樂正白明達造新聲：剏萬歲樂藏鈎樂七夕相逢樂（中略）及十二時等。掩抑催藏，哀音斷絕，帝悅無已。」</p>
<p>白明達是龜茲人，隋志把這一一些新聲列在龜茲部樂曲裏。我一們看了這些曲名，便能想到這些一曲子都是依照舊有的歌辭，呌白一明達另譜上一個新調。日本人林一謙三作了一篇「隋唐燕樂調研究，」他的結論說：「俗樂諸調可以說是穿着中國衣裳的胡樂調」）郭沫若譯本頁一二〇）我認爲是對的。所以那些豓篇，不是是把調子胡化了，那些歌辭仍是隋煬帝時代所舊有的。</p>
<p>我校定的敦煌十二時第十種題：「普勸四衆依敎修行」，是最長的一篇。全篇都是用三三七的句子，每時少的重疊九次，多的到十六次，共一百三十五首，兩千三百來個字，所以我把他呌作「大十二時」。伯卷二七一四號有云。「中和年，閏三月，飢餓人民遞相殺」，極容易呌我們聯想到秦婦吟的「中和癸卯春三月」，並且應該是同一時代的作品。考癸卯是中和三年，不閏三月；中和五年（八八五）纔閏三月。這篇「大十二時」，便應該是中和五年或者稍後風年所作的。又伯卷二〇五四號是同光二年（九二四）寫本，却沒有「中和年」這一首。想因後來與時事沒有關係了，演唱的人便把那一首刪去。這篇「大十二時」在敦煌石窟裏竟保存了四個寫本，是由於唐末五代的寺院裏，多用他來作講唱讀本的原故。從最末一首可以看出來：</p>
<p>「敬疑講，日將西，</p>
<p>計想門徒總大歸。</p>
<p>念佛一時歸舍去，</p>
<p>明日依時莫交遲。」</p>
<p>這篇「大十二時」的四個寫本，有三個不著撰人姓氏，惟伯二〇五四卷背，記「智嚴大師十二時一卷」。道個智嚴大師應該是誰呢？</p>
<p>若確定這篇「大十二時」是中和五年（八八五）或稍後的作品，這個智嚴大師便不應該是金陵牛頭山的智嚴大師，（六〇〇—六七七）更不應該是佛大先的弟十智嚴大師，也不像是終南山至相寺譯經的智嚴大師。只好說這位智嚴大師是唐代中和年間一位不大有名的和尙。這樣說法，在論理上是對的，在事實上未必便對。因爲景總傳燈錄裏的誌公十二時，我們已經辨明出於僞託，敦煌出來的白侍郞十二時行孝文，白侍郞是指的白居易，不待辨就知道是僞託。那兩篇都是出於無名作家之手，經過了長期的傳誦，纔歸在誌公和白居易名下的。我們明白了這一點，對於這一篇「大十二時」，說是託之誌公以前的智嚴是對的，說是託之牛頭山的智嚴大師也是對的。</p>
<p>第四到第八五種十二時都呌作「行孝文」，第八種伯卷三八二一號是講了十二個歷史上的故事，我另有專篇的討論和考證。</p>
<p>陳振孫直齋書錄解題卷十二神仙類有許先生十二時歌一卷，解云：「不知其名」。又宋釋曉瑩的羅湖野錄卷三載寳峯湛堂準禪師的十二時頌。他們的時代，應比敦煌出的略晚一點。（三十六年十一月十八日寫，三十七年三月二十六日改稿。）</p>
<h3 id="c130">書陸善經事　向宗魯先生遺著 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>日人所傳文選集注百二十卷本，其殘卷羅叔言印行之，今又有倭方新印本。其中多引陸善經說，楊惺吾所抄古卷于三十卷本，其首卷亦錄陸善經說於眉端。而善經兩唐書無傳，仕履莫詳。森立之經籍訪古志云：「陸善經注文選事，篇檢史志，不哉其目。」知其垂意於此者久矣。</p>
<p>今考唐開成石經刻集賢院學士宰相李林甫等進月令注表，稱同撰注人有直學士河南府倉曹參軍陸善經。新唐書藝文志，載御刋定禮記月令一卷，其子注列集賢院學士李林甫諸人注解，其中有直學士三人，善經其一也。其結銜詳略不同者，蓋善經本官爲河南府倉曹參軍，以修書故入集賢爲直學十。唐六典卷三十云：「河南府倉曹參軍正七品下。」卷九云：「集賢殿畫院，五品以上爲學士，六品以下爲直學士。」善經官在六品以下，故爲直學土，史志省略其本官耳。日本古鈔卷子本蒙求載李良薦蒙求表，後有題識云：「天寳五年，（年疑載，時已改年爲載也。）八月一日，饒州刺史李良上表，令國子司業陸善經爲表。」（見日本訪書志。利器謹按：巴黎藏敦煌殘卷李氏蒙求P.2710李良進表，有「良令國子司業陸善經造表，表未行而良授替，事因寢矣。」題識一行。）唐六典卷二十一云：「國子司業，從四品下。」蓋善經前爲河南府倉曹參軍，入爲集賢院直學士，至天寳五年，始累遷至司業也。</p>
<p>新唐書藝文志子部，有陸善經注孟子七卷，亦見崇文總目，云「陸善經刪趙注。」孫宜公孟子音義多引其說，其序云：「爲之注者，則有趙岐陸善經。」又云：「自陸善經已降，其所訓詁，雖小有異同，而共宗趙氏。」僞孟子孫疏，於題辭下亦云：「至於皇朝崇文總目，孟子獨存趙歧注十四卷，陸善經注七卷。」近代馬竹吾輯善經注孟佚說，乃謂「善經不詳何人」，疏矣。</p>
<p>善經所著，又有新字林，廣韻多引之，近代有黃右原漢學堂輯本。任幼植字林考逸亦附於每部之末，書尾載丁小山籤記云：「廣韻十虞樹下引作陸該，字林黃輯本櫥字下注云：「疑該是名，善經其字也。』」案唐人多以字行，善經名該，而表文仍稱善經，蓋以比歟？</p>
<p>其所注他書，見於日本滕原佐世見在書目者，有：周易八卷，古文尙書十卷，周書十六卷，（在詩類，疑毛詩之誤。）三禮三十卷，三傳三十卷，詩語六卷，又列子八卷。（亦載孟子七卷。）其著述又有續梁元帝古今同姓名錄，（四庫總目類書類著錄永樂大典本，函海中有此書。）可謂富矣。</p>
<p>善經注文選事，見玉海五十四引集賢注記云：「開元十九年三月，蕭嵩奏王智明李元成陳居注文選。先是馮光震奉敕入院校文選，上疏以李善舊注不精，請改注，從之；光震自注得數卷，嵩以先代舊業，欲就其功，奏智明等叻之。明年五月，令智明元成陸善經專注文選，事竟不就。」案蕭嵩罷相，在開元廿一年，李林甫初相，在開元廿二年，通典卷廿一云：「集賢殿書院，每以宰相爲學士者知院事。」唐志同。校文選事，蕭嵩主之，時蕭嵩以宰相知院事也。注月令事，李林甫主之，時林甫以宰相知院事也。以此推之，則善經奉命注文選，當在開元二十一年蕭嵩罷相以前，其參與汪月令事，當在開元二十二年林甫旣相之後，天寳五年爲國子司業，則其河南府倉曹參軍，爲集賢院直學士，自在天寳五年之前矣。集賢注記稱「事竟不就」，而集注多引其說，則陸氏固有成書；豈善經初受命與王李同注，事旋中輟，善經本發憤獨成之耶？</p>
<h3 id="c131">鼓吹與鐃歌 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 汪世清</p>
<p>鼓吹饒歌，是二是一，史乘所載，頗見紛紜。爲着使之較易淸明，我想約略地把它們分析一下。</p>
<p>（一）後漢書禮儀志註引蔡邕體樂志：「漢樂四品：一曰大予樂，典郊廟上陸殿諸食舉之樂。……二曰周頌雅樂，典辟雍　射六宗社稷之樂。……三曰黃門鼓吹，天子所以宴樂羣臣，詩所謂坎坎鼓我，蹲蹲舞我者也。其短簫鐃歌，軍樂也。其傳曰：黃帝歧伯所造，以建威揚德，風勸士也」。漢樂體系，具見於此；但流傳後世的，却只有短簫鐃歌朱　等二十二曲。晋書樂志：「漢時有短簫饒歌之樂，其曲有朱鷺，思悲翁，艾如張，上之回，雍離，戰城南，巫山高，將進　，君馬黃，上陵，有所思，雉子班，聖人出，芳樹，上邪，臨高臺，遠如期，石留，務成，玄雲，黃爵行，釣竿等曲，列於鼓吹，多序戰陣之事。」魏，吳，晋也曾相繼傲造，諸曲篇名，離各有更代，而總稱還沿用着短蕭鐃歌。按蔡文鼓吹係宴樂，而鐃歌却　軍衆；且晋書亦稱「多序戰陣之事」，則與蔡文更屬相符。以此，鼓吹與鐃歌在應用上顯有分別，從原始上看來，無疑地是兩種不同的漢樂。所以，後來引用蔡文的，極多於「短簫饒歌」之上，標着號數，給它和前三者並列着以表示有所區分了。（見宋書和文獻通考等。）</p>
<p>（二）但蔡文語氣，終覺含糊。如果在前面沒有明示蒲「四品」字樣，則把鐃歌看做鼓吹的一種也很通順而自然。且短簫饒歌最早見於晋書。東京大亂，諸樂散亡，這些恐怕也還是漢以後掇拾而成。故所收篇數，後代相傳，多不相同。晋書載爲二十二篇，宋書爲十八篇，而唐柳宋元却又考證爲十二篇。不僅如此，其中各篇也不全是軍中之樂。如上之回述巡幸，上陵述祭祀，朱鷺述祥瑞，可見鐃歌內容實際已很廣泛。至於務成，黃爵，玄雲，遠如期，則據建初錄又多係騎吹曲，今也屬於鐃歌。魏晋製作，因此就與原義相違，而趨於以叙述功德爲主。這是鐃歌一個很大的轉變。到了南北朝便逕直把短簫鐃歌之名改稱爲鼓吹曲了。宋書：「漢鼓吹曲曰鐃歌」。通典：「鼓吹者，蓋短簫鐃歌。」通志要註明着：「漢晋謂之短簫鐃歌，南北朝謂之鼓吹曲。」這些，不是顯明地吿訴着鼓吹與鐃歌正是合而爲一了嗎？</p>
<p>然而區別還應該有的，那却在它們之間的從屬關係上。關於道，有着兩種不同的說法：</p>
<p>（三）崔豹占今注「漢樂有黃門鼓吹，天子所以宴樂羣臣也。短簫鐃歌，鼓吹之一章爾，亦以賜有功諸侯。然則黃門鼓吹，短簫鐃歌與橫吹曲得通名鼓吹，但所用異耳。」通典：「漢鼓吹曲有鐃歌。」楊愼詞品：「鼓吹者，諸樂之總名也。其所施用亦別。用之朝會宴　者曰黃門鼓吹，用之道路從行者曰騎吹，其師行而奏之馬上者曰橫吹，其旋師而奏之社廟者曰短簫鐃歌。」他們大概斟酌了蔡文的語氣，而且都就着鼓吹的廣義上的一種看法。實際上，正是由於他們一方面把鐃歌還原到原始的涵義，他方面却又把鼓吹擴張到諸樂的總稱，於是他們就要把鐃歌給從屬於鼓吹了。依這一說法，鐃歌便給叫做鼓吹鐃歌曲。（樂府詩集在有些鼓吹曲上即標着此名。）</p>
<p>（四）如果從饒歌的實際內容上去看，却又可以說鐃歌實在是諸樂的總和。駕端臨曾說過：魏晋以來之短簫鐃歌即古之雅頌。是的，天子宴享之樂，在古即爲雅，而祭祀之樂，在古即爲頌；鐃歌不就包含着鼓吹在內嗎？這種看法，到了南宋，便由姜　正式地予以提出。據白石道人歌曲聖宋鐃歌鼓吹曲小序：「饒歌者，漢樂也。殿前謂之鼓吹，軍中謂之騎吹。」這兒，鼓吹與騎吹並刋，且各爲鐃歌的一部，便恰好與崔豹等的意見針鋒相對着。他採用了柳宗元的命名而給叫做鐃歌鼓吹曲，對照看來，却也別饒興味。</p>
<p>總之，鼓吹與鐃歌在漢代製樂的當初，原該是兩種不同的樂章；但後來演變的結果，却已經是一而二二而一了。</p>

<h3 id="c134">一日之計在於夜 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>最近給學生出了一個「夜讀」的題目，居然有一個學生寫道：「一日之計在於晨這句話，照我看起來是不十分合理的，因爲我不慣於一早讀書，中午又太熱，當然夜　最適合了。早晨的聲音實在太嘈雜了：『黃媽，替我拿一瓶開水來！』『搭我晾幾碗粥！』『搭我梳頭，梳二條小辮子呀！……」『搭我……』你想還能讀書嗎？下午又要做三角英文，……根本不可能看書。」這位同學，將來一定是林語堂先生的同志，我已經給他批了「企予望之，拭目以待」了。</p>
<p>其實一加細想，我們什麼計畫是早晨才做的？雖然「計」字也可以解作「有順利的開始，一定便會有圓滿的未來」，但早晨在都市完全是担糞桶賣靑菜的世界，就是上辦公廳和寫字間的大人大亨之流，也是非九點以後不會懶洋洋動身的，除了那此號稱普羅階級的工人。反過來，如果你在每晚七時以後到舞場，酒吧間，飯店，歌塲，戲院去看看，那豈不眞的可以代表都市生活之裝面？這裏面還不算核心，核心又在大亨們的「分廠」，老闆們的「秘窟」，或者聞人們的「小公館」裏，這些地方，在夜深人靜之後，算盤與腦筋同動，人肉與金鈔齊吃，這才是支配都市的中心地帶，使每個人的精神和物質感受威脅的主力。</p>
<p>所以古人才要主張衾影無慚，不欺暗室。</p>
<p>然而凡是格言口號總都代表一種缺點與失敗，任何人全會在塲面上大吹大擂，却沒有不問後門玩花樣的，關西夫子楊震的四知主義我想一定是寓言罷，如果目下眞有那種人，我保險他是百分之百的白痴，其不被人所嗤笑者幾希！蓋在此時此地，人格的分寸，即是金錢財產的分寸，只消有了錢，並沒有人敢追問其來源如何也。</p>
<p>孟子却有更妙的話，說什麼存夜氣，存平旦之氣。平旦猶可說也，這個夜氣，除了使我們打冷戰之外，還有何用！夜氣儘管有點鮮凉之感，無非使那些吃人的傢伙頭腦更銳敏些，更周密些，絕不會使他們有半點省覺，可斷言也。也許就因爲這個，才有「平生不做虧心事，夜半敲門鬼不驚」的說法，實際上因爲人總是作虧心事，而且黑夜作的特別多—風高才放火，月黑可殺人。——所以黑夜才會生出鬼來，一似入了夜間，宇宙便不爲人所統治，而是一種專門與人作對的怪物所管轄。不知此種鬼怪，不在荒山野墓，也不在戰塲陰陬，而千眞萬確的長在人們的心裏，或者更進一步，怕鬼者的本人，就是一個最凶最惡的鬼也。</p>
<p>如此說來，夜是鬼的世界，亦即不必置疑。我們所看到的紳士大人，衣冠縉笏之流，全可作如是觀。他們全是白天萎頓如死人，到夜裏却在歡如瘋顚的，羅兩峯畫鬼趣圖，恐怕少不了這一種寳貨。我們讀聊齋志異，看見多少夜問的浪漫故事，眞有點令人樂與鬼狐爲鄰，無怪「蓮香」上的桑生很自豪的說：「雄來吾有利劍，雌來當款關而納之」，這裏面的鬼比人要有味的多，此輩大可以不必專事「夜遊」，不妨於光天化日之下，與生人來一比賽也。</p>
<p>焚油膏以繼　，本是古人獎勵人努力之語，其實這裏面不一定要你作書呆子，眞去兀兀窮年，大約也包括了及時行樂之意，此李白的春夜宴桃李圜序所以成爲千秋佳作也。何况今人亦如古人一樣，讀書的最後目的是什麼？有了今朝之「夜以繼日」，才有將來的「俾夜作畫」，不見夫那些年意氣如雲的健者，而今全成了長期在大飯店開房間過夜生活的主要角色乎？</p>
<p>夜，夜，夜，有「苗頭」的夜，黃金的夜！我不惜歌而誦之云。</p>
<h3 id="c135">郁達夫的詩 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 茂仁</p>
<p>自由談常刊舊詩，每次讀後總是莫知其所以然的憶起郁達夫先生的舊詩來。郁氏作舊詩不少，我手頭僅有其手寫靑島雜事詩之一，係友人所轉贈者，詩曰：</p>
<p>萬斛濤頭一島淸，正因死士義田橫，而今劉豫稱齊</p>
<p>帝，唱破家田飾太平。</p>
<p>又記其另一詩曰：</p>
<p>擾攘中原苦未休，安危連擊小瀛洲，諸娘不改唐裝束，父老猶思漢冕旒。忽報秦關懸赤幟，獨愁大刧到淸流，景升兒子終豚犬，帝豫當年亦姓劉。</p>
<p>愛郁氏詩者，世不乏人，近讀二十六年辛報，五月二十七日有吳奠君記「鄭子瑜編印達夫詩詞集」一文，略謂厦門靑年詩人鄭子瑜，與自台灣過厦門的郁達夫在一家咖啡店會談結果，打算編輯一部中國現代作家舊詩集。後來因爲材料的不易搜集，只編成一本達夫詩詞集。此書出版處郁達夫本來介紹鄭君與日本帝國大學的一位中國文學專家神田敎授，但鄭君因爲考慮到銷路問題，所以又打算在國內出版，現正寫信與上海某書屋的某編輯，北平某大學的某敎授接洽云。到六月十六日的辛報，復有鄭子瑜君一文，談郁氏舊詩，而不及他所編輯的達夫詩詞集的接洽出版，已經有了結果沒有。</p>
<p>鄭君此文中有一極有趣味的地方，說：「自去年他（郁氏到福建來做官，上海的小報都駡他『失節」。」這裏所說的小報是那一張無從查考，但若所言不虛，可知竟有人對於郁達夫的做本國領士之內的一名參議，就已視爲「失節」。尤有意思者，編郁氏詩詞的鄭君，好像也很怕郁氏的眞個「失節」，說郁氏的步釣合題壁原韻詩是「再三辯白」失節之作，並引詩中「坑灰未冷待揚塵」句，說：「這句話說的如果是眞，則郁達夫先生尙有希望！」現在郁氏身死異域，不再「失節」做官，大概總能不負鄭氏之望了罷！原詩據鄭君所錄，爲：</p>
<p>歲暮窮極，有某府憐其貧，囑爲撰文，因步釣台題壁原韻以作答：</p>
<p>萬刧艱難病廢身，姓名雖在已非眞，多慚鮑叔能憐我，只怕灌夫要駡人。泥馬縱驕終少骨，坑灰未死待揚塵，國門呂覽應傳世，何必臣雄再劇秦。</p>
<h3 id="c136">黃園之鶴 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>日前本刊載有半夢老人之鶴舞詩紀，筆墨華　，誦之飲遲無已。老人謂與錢濛與同訪黃園，一覘鶴舞，今不知鶴尙左在否云云，錢濛叟是否即士靑先生？果爾，固予之忘年交也。黃園爲予常遊之地，每逢休沐日，輒往看花品茗，與園主岳淵翁作半日淸談，蓋藉以一滌塵襟也。鶴靈砂滿頂，羽白似雪，見客往往翩翩起舞，或疾或徐，或俯或仰，或如烟　，或如雲浮，且拍翅作聲，間以清唳，翁日飼以鱸鰍等物，量極宏，日耗二斤餘，月計之所費不貲也。聞是鶴本爲滬北徐園家禽，後爲白龍山人所獲，山人居南市芷園，蓄鶴雌雄凡二，作松鶴圖，常對之以寫生，不意某年隆冬，雌鶴忽病，不治死，雄鶴失伴，爲之飲食銳减，不啻奉倩之傷神焉。山人不忍覩其頹喪之狀，遂以雄鶴贈貧民習藝所飼養，但習藝所以求生產者，今蓄一鶴，非但無生產之足云，且多鶴俸之支出，大有難乎爲繼之勢，岳淵知之，詢其代價，執事者謂公物不能出售，君眞愛好者，請捐米十石，以易之可也。其時米每石十圓，所費凡百金，岳淵囑一園丁籠之以歸，籠載於人力車，鶴展翅出籠外，車輪轉動，翅乃受傷，園丁粗魯，不之知也，故直至近今，一翅猶垂欹，未能愈，引爲憾事云。釣台題壁一律是：</p>
<p>不是尊前愛惜身，佯狂</p>
<p>難免假成眞，曾因酒醉鞕名馬，生怕情多累美人。刧數東南天作孽，鷄鳴風雨海揚塵，惡歌痛哭終何補，義士紛紛說帝秦。</p>
<p>郁氏的舊詩這實在覺得甚好，索性再抄鄭君所錄的一苜：</p>
<p>亂擲黃金買阿嬌，窮來吳市再吹簫，簫聲遠渡江淮去，吹到揚州廿四橋。</p>
<h3 id="c137">垃圾堆中的石頭 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 孺子</p>
<p>有一天，意大利藝術大家米凱郞琪羅在佛羅郞斯城的馬路上閒步，看見街旁垃圾堆中，有一塊著名產大理石地喀垃垃所出的大理石，不知是被那一位雕刻家或工人雕壞了棄置不用的。米凱郞瑛羅對這塊潔白的大理石發生了興趣，走上前去仔細端詳，尋思了一會，覺得這塊石頭雖已被雕壞了，但是棄之可惜，於是就吩咐工人把這塊石頭搬回去。不久以後，米凱郞琪羅的轟動藝壇的傑作「少年大衛」出世，原來就是用這一塊垃圾堆中的石頭雕成的。</p>
<p>「良工無棄材」，由此可見。吃進去的是草，擠出來的是奶，這是藝術家的偉大處。物質條件相同，然而從手法與技巧上，可以見出藝術的高低。</p>

<p>英國製造無綫電收音機，最近已有飛躍的進步。在泰姆士河畔的華爾登城中，有一家無綫電收音機製造廠，目前已能全部機械生產，絕對不需人力。廠裏有一長達七十英尺的管狀機器，由電子管理，這「管子」的一端「呑進」了由另機器上「送來」的各項另件，於是一架架整整齊齊的無錢電收音機就在這「管子」的另一端不絕地「吐」出來——祗要二十秒鐘，便可以製成一具品質很好的收音機。（如意）</p>

<p>當十六世紀，歐洲新旧兩敎之鬥爭劇烈，牽及政治，牽及國際，殘殺動亂，至極慘酷。法蘭西全境騰沸，歲無寗日，國無靜土，英亦屢涉漩渦，伊麗沙白當國，獨特以鎭定以和平綏靖國內，復以堅壁自守，杜絕外擾，故能休養生息，百業振興，工商俱發展，造成多數中當階級Wealthby　middlle　class，奠定國基。因以申張海運，無數航海家，向全球各處進　，浸及西班牙之航權，屬地，取而代之。內外相維，愈强愈富，雖小農遭受兼併之苦，卒得法律之保護，不爲大害。同時文藝昌明，沙士比亞Shakespeare倍根Bacon斯賓賽爾Spencer之戲曲，文學，哲學，科學，皆於此時期出世。所以她的任期內，任何方面，風雲際會，共同放出燦爛之花。至於她個人之容華絕代，地位優崇，足資豔羨，乃餘事耳，豈現在之伊麗沙白所能比擬萬一！惟最近倫敦消息，英王將出巡澳洲，道遠期長，須以公主攝政，惟此一點略彷彿前人。英人傳統的典範，太子與公主皆有Heir資格，且不乏實例也。</p>
<p>英國為現在大邦中惟一之君主國，其君主除王冕儀從虛榮外表外，一切權利義務，實綽有平民風度。世謂「德模克拉西」之眞義，乃在君主國之英國，信非虛語。此其君主制度所以永存，而無礙於民主精神，固與日本之天皇具有神式信仰者不同。其歷史上著名之君主，一伊麗沙白，一維多利亞Queen　Vctoria（始兼印度，稱大不列顚皇帝），各有千秋。以視中國史上豔稱周之成康，漢之文景，淸之康乾，有過之無不及，而皆是女性，其爲國家光榮，竟非其他男性國君所能比，可稱奇蹟。中國歷史上之公主，無參加帝統之可能，蓋緣宗法制度，逈異泰西，所謂「女生外向」，雖爲皇帝血胤，終屬外姓耳。因此皇帝若發生問題，（或年幼或因他故不能執行政權）則太后出頭攬政，漢之呂雉，唐之武則天，淸之那拉氏，姑無論劣蹟昭彰，難與赫赫功德之英國女主共論，其來歷亦根本不同。蓋皆因「有君主之夫」而爲Queen，非繼統常國之Queen也。故其政權，乃乘主少國疑之際，以攫取之，那拉氏則一再立幼，以便「垂　」，終致淸運於衰亡。</p>
<p>僞滿皇溥儀，則前淸之宣統，辛亥遜國後仍居故宮十餘年，請英人莊士敦敎授英文，兼研西學，漸染歐風，起一英文名曰Henry，所娶之榮女士亦饒有女學生之風格，其英名即Elizabeth。事變前上海出版之逸經雜誌，曾載彼夫婦之英文署名小簡，頗風趣，雖慕英國亨利及伊麗沙白之大名，似未明白二人之事蹟。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Inauguration of the Legislative Yuan Session This Morning; Number of Seats for the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Still Under Negotiation; Zhang Qun's Continued Leadership of the Executive Yuan Reportedly Confirmed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] As of 10:00 PM on the 7th, the total number of legislators registering for the first session of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution reached 370, exceeding the legal total number of representatives by more than one-fifth. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Lai Lianying, and others have also registered. It is almost certain that the legal assembly on the 8th will not be affected by other factors. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 10:00 AM. The Assembly Preparatory Office has issued notifications to all registered legislators and published a public announcement in the newspapers. Many heads of the National Government and diplomatic envoys in the capital will also be invited to attend the ceremony. Reporter seats are located upstairs. Old Legislative Yuan observers' passes or temporary entry/exit passes are required for seating. Legislators must also wear temporary attendance passes for entry and exit. The Preparatory Office has paid close attention to the inspection and guarding of the assembly venue, so there have been no unexpected troubles before the assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] The first session of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution will convene independently at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM on the 8th to declare its formal establishment. The order of the assembly opening ceremony is as follows: (1) Ceremony begins, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Chairman takes his seat (a temporary chairman is elected first), (4) Music plays, (5) National anthem is sung, (6) Bow three times to the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, (7) Chairman reports, (8) Chairman of the National Government delivers a speech, (9) Guests deliver speeches, (10) Music plays, (11) Ceremony concludes, (12) Visit the Mausoleum.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the candidates for Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, after Chen Lifu was nominated by the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, some Kuomintang legislators expressed their opinions. Their view is that if the Vice President is also from the South, it would disrupt the geographical balance. Therefore, Huang Yuren and others have promoted Fu Sinian for the position. However, the Central Committee believes that this matter has been decided and is not easy to change. It has been decided that Yu Youren will continue to serve as President of the Control Yuan, and Liu Zhe will continue to serve as Vice President. In this way, Southerners will lead the Legislative Yuan, and Northerners will lead the Control Yuan, which should still achieve a North-South balance. Regarding the selection of new cabinet members, the rumor that Zhang Qun will continue as Premier has been confirmed as of the evening of the 7th, while He Yingqin will focus on military affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] On the eve of the Legislative Yuan assembly under the Constitution, the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties once again encountered complications regarding the number of seats for their elected legislators. The Kuomintang is eager to find a remedy to allow those nominated by the two parties who were not elected to participate in government administrative work and continue their cooperation. On the 7th, Zhang Qun, Lei Zhen, and others traveled separately to find a way to resolve the situation. At 9:00 PM, Zhang invited Kuomintang figures Chen Lifu, Lei Zhen, and others to his official residence in the Executive Yuan to discuss solutions for the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties' legislative candidates. At 11:00 PM, Lei first visited Xu Chuanlin and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party, followed by Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, for 20 minutes each. However, the matter has not reached the final stage. The Kuomintang is making every effort to find a way to address the number of legislative seats, while also hoping to continue cooperation with the two parties in administrative matters. Therefore, although this negotiation is taking place on the eve of the assembly, it is still in progress.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Mo Dehui visited Xu Chuanlin and others in the afternoon of the 7th to discuss the issue of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties' participation in the Legislative Yuan and offered his opinions. He left for Shanghai by night train on the 7th, reportedly to visit Zhang Junmai and make some suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Majority of US Congress Members Support Active Aid to China; Chennault Discusses Testimony in the US <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Flying Tiger General Chennault returned to Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday with his wife, Ms. Anna Chennault. At 10:00 AM yesterday, he met with reporters at the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) on the Bund to report on his trip to the United States to provide the House Foreign Affairs Committee with his views on US aid to China and to answer various questions from reporters.</p>
<p>According to General Chennault, after he testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee, the majority of Congress members supported his opinion that US aid to China should be greater than the amount of $463.3 million. Chennault also said that he had private discussions with General Wedemeyer, General MacArthur, and Bullitt about aid to China, and they all supported aid to China and advocated not only economic aid but also military aid. However, he had never heard that General Marshall supported aid to China. The general reaction in the United States to Chennault's statement was very positive. When asked by a reporter whether US aid could continue to increase in the future, General Chennault replied, "I think it is possible. I don't believe this appropriation is the last one. But increasing aid to China requires a new bill to be passed in Congress. I have not heard of anyone planning to propose a bill on this matter."</p>
<p>Regarding the new head of the Sino-American Economic Cooperation Administration, Mr. Lapham, General Chennault said that he knew of Mr. Lapham's qualifications and believed that he was fully capable of this position, especially because he was very knowledgeable about Far Eastern issues, making him an excellent choice. However, Chennault had not heard of this matter in the United States until he arrived in Shanghai. Chennault said that aid to China should be used for postwar reconstruction, such as repairing the Yuehan Railway and reviving industry, but it should be focused in the lower Yellow River region. General Chennault also said that he believed that China's currency reform could be done, and that in Washington, someone had proposed that the United States lend China 600 million taels of silver for this purpose. However, this bill still needs to be formally proposed in Congress, and it is impossible to predict whether it will pass. Regarding Feng Yuxiang's situation in the United States, Chennault said that he had no status in the United States. Most Americans of high standing never pay attention to this person, and very few people interact with him. In general, the American people are not very interested in the situation in China and lack understanding. However, they all strongly advocate rejecting the Communist Party. American newspapers publish very little news about the situation in China, with the New York Times being the most sympathetic to China. The American people have a strong impression of corrupt Chinese government officials. In fact, the information they receive is often inaccurate. Chennault himself believes that there are very few corrupt officials. There are many wise officials that the American people do not know about. When asked who is the most capable administrative leader in China, Chennault laughed and said, "I have come into contact with many capable officials, but it is impossible to say who is the most capable." General Chennault also replied to a reporter's question, saying that he does not advocate that the US military join the National Army in fighting the Communist Army unless it is necessary. However, the US government is very willing to help China by sending personnel to train the National Army. He also believes that the strategic focus of the National Army used to be Shenyang, but he does not know the current situation. Finally, Chennault said that the United States itself is also facing economic difficulties, with its current debt reaching $260 billion (including public debt), and domestic taxes are very high. A foreign reporter immediately asked him whether the United States should sacrifice its own military spending to aid China. Chennault replied "No." The United States should train its own army while allocating some of its expenses to aid Europe and China.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened some key members of the Kuomintang at his official residence on the morning of the 7th for an important discussion. At 3:40 PM, he summoned Wang Fenggang, Commissioner of the Tenth District of Hebei Province, at his official residence to inquire about the administrative situation in the Tenth District and the general situation of the pacification work in the area, and gave Wang much encouragement. The conversation lasted for fifteen minutes. Wang also visited Chen Guofu and Chiang Ching-kuo on the 7th.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Military News Agency reports: Our navy repair ship "Xingan," which recently returned from the United States, captured two Japanese fishing vessels, "Tokusei No. 1" and "Tokusei No. 2," at 6:00 PM on the 6th at 28 degrees North latitude and 122 degrees 30 minutes East longitude, for intruding into our fishing zone to fish. Our authorities had previously publicly announced that the navy would patrol and seize Japanese vessels that intruded into our fishing zones. It has been decided to handle these first two vessels caught seriously as a warning to others.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the issue of Japanese fishing vessels intruding into our fishing zones, although diplomatic channels have been used to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters for years, no solution has been reached. In order to ensure our fishing rights and effectively prevent Japanese fishing vessels from intruding into our fishing zones again, our authorities have ordered the coastal navy to seize any Japanese fishing vessels found intruding into our fishing zones in the future.</p>

Other costs such as loading, unloading, storage, insurance, custody, and transportation are not preferential and should be handled in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the Yuan's Payment Measures.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Amid intense fighting in western Henan, our reporter recently met with Commander Ding Shuheng, a team leader from Deng County, in the capital. During the Deng County campaign last winter, Ding led the local people to defend the city for nine days and nights, killing and wounding 10,000 bandit troops, for which he was commended by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. During his attendance at the National Assembly in the capital this time, he also met with Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense several times and made many suggestions on the issue of establishing local armed forces. His view on the current war situation in western Henan is that the bandit troops are attempting to eliminate their worries before coveting Sichuan and then forcing their way to the Yangtze River line. The situation in western Henan is important. If the bandits unfortunately succeed, then the Qinling, Wudang, Tongbai, Dabie, and Funiu mountain areas in all four directions will have no peaceful days. The bandit troops have long resented the local team in western Henan, and the people's sentiment of self-defense is extremely high and they will never accept the bandit troops' "transformation." Currently, the offensive and defensive battles in Nanyang and other counties are being fought fiercely. However, the team's weapons and ammunition are all inferior. He has suggested to the authorities that in order to maintain the strategic area of western Henan and to encourage the people to defend their homeland, the government should not only provide rapid reinforcements to resolve the crisis, but should also actively support the teams, strengthen the militia in each county by equipping them according to the standards of the National Army, and provide ammunition at any time. The team's supplies should be used as military rations. In addition, after the situation has stabilized somewhat, a command agency for the people's bandit suppression and self-defense should be established in Henan Province to achieve significant results.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] The Xi'an Pacification Headquarters announced at 8:00 PM on July 7th: The battle in eastern Gansu is expected to conclude by the evening of the 7th or the morning of the 8th. Remnants of bandits, numbering over 20,000, who were routed by the National Army from areas including Bin County, Fengxiang, and Niangniangtai in Xiantai, fled into eastern Gansu. They were ambushed in Xiaojin Town (between Zhenyuan and Ning County) and heavily besieged. Fierce fighting has raged for two days and nights since the 5th, with the bandits suffering over half casualties and the remainder completely溃散. Preliminary estimates indicate 9,000 bandit casualties and 3,600 captured, along with countless military supplies, marking a major victory in bandit suppression in recent years. Sources close to Hu Zongnan revealed that General Hu had been listening to reports of victories from all sides in daily military briefings, his face beaming with joy. All newspapers in Xi'an rushed out extra editions on the night of July 7th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] Between Zhenyuan and Jingchuan in eastern Gansu, the National Army has achieved substantial gains in recent days, capturing 3,600 bandits. Currently, the National Army is advancing north from Zhenyuan, Pingliang, Changwu, and Jingchuan, tightening the encirclement to annihilate Peng's bandits in eastern Gansu. North of Zhao Village Town in Qian County and south of the Jing River, there are over a thousand bandits. The National Army is also cooperating with local militias in their search and suppression efforts.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] Bandits who fled north from Hedaoxian and Dangyuan Townships to Tunzi Township (all three locations are between Zhenyuan and Jingchuan) in eastern Gansu have been mostly annihilated. The bandits located 15 kilometers west of Ning County have largely fled north along the main road into Xifeng Township in Qingyang County, and there is a possibility that they will continue north to attack Qingyang and Heshui County towns. Another smaller group has fled east into the county of Ning County.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, July 7] The local militias in western Henan have inflicted heavy casualties on the bandits in recent days, achieving brilliant results. However, the bandits besieging Xichuan, Deng County, and Xixiakou are still launching fierce attacks with all their might, and the situation has not eased. In addition to sending reinforcements along different routes, we are also using air transport to supply the local militias.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, July 7] The defense of Xichuan has reached its climax, with the local militias fighting valiantly amidst extreme hardship. Piles of bandit corpses have reached over 2,000, and the local militias have also suffered numerous casualties. Fierce fighting continues in the suburbs of Deng County.</p>

Fierce fighting is ongoing as the local militias bravely resist. A telegram from the radio station in the mountains south of Xixiakou received by this reporter on the afternoon of the 7th stated: (1) The defense of Xixiakou entered a state of mixed combat on the afternoon of the 6th. The residents defending the north and south camps are determined to coexist or perish with the stronghold. Last night, there were more than five back-and-forth clashes, with bullets flying everywhere and a tragic scene.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] The National Army in Neixiang withdrew on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xinyang, July 7] The bandits besieging Zhengyang launched a fierce attack throughout the night, repeatedly charging the city walls. The southeast and west gates were particularly intense. The defending troops fought valiantly, and elite units of the National Army rushed to their aid, arriving 11 li north of Zhengyang on the 7th. Zhengyang is expected to be relieved soon. Last night, this reporter visited Deputy Commander Zhu of the Fifth Pacification Zone to inquire about his views on the war situation. He replied with a smile: The fortifications in Nanyang are solid, the troops' morale is high, and their combat power is extremely strong. The bandits will not advance an inch without sacrificing 100,000 men.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e24">The First Legislative Yuan Convenes on Its Own <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The first Legislative Yuan elected by the people convened on its own in the capital this morning. This is another step forward for our country's politics towards democratic constitutionalism. Because the first National Assembly elected under the constitution has completed its basic task by electing the President and Vice President and adjourned on May 1st, the formation of a democratically elected government still awaits the President's nomination of a candidate for Premier, seeking the consent of the Legislative Yuan, before the new Premier can form a new democratically elected government and start afresh with the people. From now on, all decisions regarding domestic and foreign affairs, as well as central and local systems, will be implemented in accordance with the new constitution. At the same time, the Executive Yuan will be responsible to the Legislative Yuan for any measures taken. Therefore, the first Legislative Yuan's independent convening in the capital today is truly a watershed moment in the history of our country's democratic constitutionalism. Today, all 450 million compatriots across the country are looking towards the capital, anticipating the unfolding of a new politics and a new political atmosphere. Everyone is filled with joy, wishing success to the first Legislative Yuan's self-convening. We would very much like to take this opportunity to express our hopes for the first Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>First, the first Legislative Yuan that convenes on its own today is of a completely different nature from the Legislative Yuan of the past. Not only are all legislators elected by the people, but the Legislative Yuan also enjoys supreme power under the constitution. The President's appointment of the Premier requires the consent of the Legislative Yuan, and the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan for important national decisions. Therefore, its status is equivalent to the House of Representatives in countries that adopt a responsible cabinet system. As our country's democratic politics are still in the learning stage, the responsibility borne by the legislators who represent the people in exercising legislative power is naturally even greater. Especially during this time of suppression, when the political, economic, military, and social crises are deepening, the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines should be viewed from a broader perspective, and there should be no petty emotions or personal biases that cause trouble within the Legislative Yuan, causing the political situation to fluctuate and deepening the current crisis.</p>
<p>Second, the essence of democratic constitutionalism emphasizes the spirit of the rule of law. Under democratic politics, all actions of both the government and the people must be based on the country's fundamental law (the constitution) and all ordinary laws. Our country's Article 175 of the Constitution is known to everyone and is simple and clear, which can serve as a code of conduct for the entire nation. However, since the establishment of the Legislative Yuan by the National Government, it is unknown how many laws have been formulated. Not to mention that ordinary people do not understand them clearly, even legislators and law enforcers do not know how many kinds there are. Some are changed in the morning and evening, and some are nominal and have no practical effect, which is equivalent to empty words and fundamentally loses the meaning of legislation. In fact, laws are not about quantity, but about being practical and easy to implement. Therefore, we hope that the first Legislative Yuan will adhere to the spirit of "simplifying laws," sort out the laws formulated by the previous Legislative Yuan, eliminate those that should be eliminated, and merge those that should be merged, so that the people can have a clear understanding of the country's laws and know what to follow. However, if the Legislative Yuan believes that it is necessary to add new laws, it should also pay attention to whether they are practical and easy to implement, so that the government and the people can jointly abide by them in order to implement the spirit of legislation.</p>
<p>Third, constitutional scholars unanimously acknowledge that democratic politics is public opinion politics. Legislators are elected by the people and represent the people in exercising legislative power. It can be said that they come from the people and deeply understand the sufferings of the people. However, we still hope that legislators who come from the people can often be among the people, so as not to be separated from the people. According to the precedents of democratic advanced countries such as Britain and the United States, various investigation committees are established in the House of Representatives. For certain special issues, they must first be investigated clearly before being submitted for discussion. At the same time, there are also organizations such as public opinion polls. Whenever a major issue arises, public opinion must first be solicited to know its support, and then decide on its own attitude. Therefore, we hope that after the Legislative Yuan convenes on its own, it should establish various investigation committees and public opinion polls within the Yuan. In addition to frequently holding meetings in the capital, all elected legislators should also go to the people to explore public opinion as the basis for their speeches and arguments.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the election disputes of legislators, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have issued a joint statement on the eve of the Legislative Yuan's self-convening, on the one hand expressing their opposition to the central government's final decision to elect those with the most votes; on the other hand, they solemnly stated that if this issue cannot be resolved reasonably, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party will not attend the Legislative Yuan. Judging from the situation, the election disputes of legislators will again cause political turmoil, which we cannot but find regrettable. Guaranteed quotas are originally of a political nature, and there is no legal basis for them, and they are not logical. No political party in any country can emphasize that voters vote for a candidate of a certain party, but since the Kuomintang has provided a promise, for the sake of morality, it should also allow more candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to be elected. The decision of the Political Affairs Conference to increase the number of seats was originally a remedial measure, but unfortunately it was not adopted by the Legislative Yuan, and the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party did not quite agree. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party should also understand the government's difficulty in coping with this factual difficulty. Now the government has decided to seek a reasonable solution through legal channels, and the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have no reason to object. Mr. Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party, also talked about the value of the rule of law when he made a speech on the issue of the Vice President election. He said: "The so-called law is like a carpenter who has rules and regulations to make squares and circles. It cannot be mixed with emotions and feelings in the slightest. There must be a spirit of hanging the law at the gate of the country and not changing a single word. If you rely on your own likes and dislikes and arbitrarily manipulate it, you cannot talk about the rule of law." The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party also issued a joint statement on April 26, saying that "maintaining the dignity of the constitution is an unavoidable duty." Therefore, the election disputes of legislators can only be resolved reasonably from the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party must not go to extremes and use "withdrawing from the Legislative Yuan" as blackmail. Fortunately, the Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body of the country and can modify the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators within the scope of legal principles, or increase the number of legislators, or establish other remedial measures in the by-elections, all of which are possible. Due to the urgency of the situation, the first Legislative Yuan must convene on its own today according to law. We hope that the elected legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party can all participate at the same time and leave this issue to the new Legislative Yuan to consider it carefully in the long run and seek a reasonable solution in law. Looking back at the lessons learned from the election disputes of National Assembly representatives, forcibly ordering those with more votes to step down will inevitably cause unexpected disputes, and the problem itself cannot be reasonably resolved. We should pay special attention to this lesson.</p>

It is heard that after the Guangdong-Hankou Railway obtains US aid materials, the Ministry of Transportation intends to dismantle the rails, locomotives, and other equipment currently used on that line and transport them to Chongqing. However, this move is bound to affect the psychology of the people of Sichuan and does not meet their requirements for engineering standards. Therefore, it is still under consideration and no final decision has been made. According to Deputy Chief Engineer Hu Maokang, Feng Ban from the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was also sent to the United States, but no concrete results were negotiated. The equipment ordered in France before the war was stranded due to some reason and has not yet been signed. The biggest difficulties for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway today are materials and construction funds. Currently, 13 of the 68 major bridges along the entire line have been completed, including the Neijiang Bridge with a total length of seven holes and 350 meters, which is only waiting for the installation of steel beams. 15 of the 28 tunnels have been completed. The Guide River Bridge, Wang'erxi Bridge, and Shigaobridge, which recently started construction, are determined to be completed before the heavy rains in early July. In addition, the earthwork for approximately 130 kilometers of the entire line has been largely completed.</p>

Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, she developed a high fever, shaking all over, and was accompanied by her husband, Wang Xiangxi, to see Dr. Wang Chengwen, a nearby doctor, for diagnosis. After receiving a prescription, she bought medicine from the Sanhetang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store on Dapu Road and took it after decocting it. Around 3 a.m. the next morning, she suddenly got up, put on her clothes, and went to Min Zhenhua's door, where she began to curse loudly. After a while, she fell to the ground and died. Afterwards, her husband, Wang Xiangxi, reported the situation to the Songshan Police Precinct, which dispatched police officers to transport the body to the coroner's office for an autopsy. Whether it was caused by a dog bite or by taking medicine, is still under investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Report from Nanjing on the 7th] The Ministry of Education recently convened relevant individuals to discuss distribution standards for this year's local basic education funds, which amount to a substantial 800 billion yuan, and a decision has now been reached. It is understood that the principle is to concentrate the use of funds and strive for effectiveness. The distribution will be as follows: 77% will be used to generally subsidize various provinces and cities, totaling 616 billion yuan; 20% will be used for demonstration expenses for basic education, totaling 160 billion yuan. In accordance with the resolutions of the Far East Basic Education Conference, Nanjing and Beiping have been designated as basic education demonstration areas, and efforts will be made to complete universal education within two years to serve as models for the entire country and to enhance international perceptions. The remaining expenses will be raised by the two cities themselves. The remaining 3% will be used for expenses such as experimental research and compiling teaching materials, totaling 24 billion yuan. It is also understood that the Ministry of Education previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, ordering that 20 billion yuan of youth training expenses be allocated from the basic education subsidy funds, which has been handled as a separate case. Secondly, regarding the proportional distribution of funds to various provinces and cities, 73% will be used for basic education expenses, 17% will be used for remedial expenses, and the remainder will be used for basic education teacher training. At the same time, the funds should be concentrated on central national schools. The subsidy funds that the northeastern provinces and cities and the pacification zones of various provinces should receive will be distributed according to the proportion.</p>

<h3 id="e96">New Records Set in Athletics at the National Games: Taiwan and Beiping Score Most, All Top Four in Weightlifting Lightweight Class Break Games Records, Weather from Last Night's Wind and Rain May Impact Today's Events: Athletic Association to Decide Temporarily <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday was the third day of the National Games. The preliminary and final rounds of men's and women's athletics continued, with three new records being set, one breaking the national record and two breaking the Games record: (1) In the women's high jump, Hebei's Yu Shusen cleared 1.40 meters, breaking Zhu Yaozhen's national record of 1.355 meters. Guangdong's Huang Zangping, who came in second with 1.33 meters, broke the Games record. (2) In the high hurdle final, Malaysia's Huang Liangquan finished in 16 seconds flat, breaking Lin Shaozhou's Games record of 16.2 seconds. (3) In the 1500-meter final, the Air Force's Yu Xiwei finished in 4 minutes and 17 seconds flat, breaking Zheng Sen's Games record of 4 minutes and 21.4 seconds. In the men's athletics scoring, Taiwanese athletes have taken the lead, ranking first in track events with 29 points, followed by Shanghai with 21 points. Next were Malaysia, the Navy, and the Air Force. In field events, the finals were not completed yesterday due to rain, so the scores have not increased or decreased. In women's athletics, Beiping City is currently in first place with 11 points, followed by Hebei with 8 points, Taiwan with 6 points, and Guangzhou with 5 points. Today is the third day of athletics, and the competition will be even more intense.</p>
<p>The ball games are gradually entering the tense stage. Football, men's and women's basketball, and men's volleyball have been narrowed down to the final eight teams, while women's volleyball has only the final four teams remaining. The consolation matches will all begin today. The first round of men's singles tennis and men's singles table tennis began yesterday and were successfully completed. The preliminary rounds of women's singles tennis and men's and women's softball are all scheduled to begin today.</p>
<p>The weightlifting competition has achieved particularly outstanding results. Yesterday was the second day, and the top four in the lightweight class and the top six in the light featherweight class all broke the previous Games records. Yesterday, the weather was gloomy, but the audience was still quite enthusiastic. The weather station has reported that the climate will change, so the reporting platform frequently urged the competition to be expedited. At 4:25 p.m., heavy rain suddenly fell, forcing the athletics and basketball competitions to be suspended. When the rain subsided slightly, the women's high jump and the men's 400-meter relay preliminary rounds were completed in the rain. The men's long jump and javelin finals had to be rescheduled for this afternoon, and the three men's basketball games that had not been completed were also rescheduled for today.</p>
<p>The schedule for today's Games was announced as usual last night by the Registration Group and will proceed according to the original program. The games that were not completed yesterday will be made up today. However, due to the wind and rain last night, whether the outdoor competitions can proceed today will be decided temporarily by the organizing committee.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Overview of Men's Track Finals: Xu Tiande's Powerful Sprint; Huang Liangzheng's Correct Footwork; Chen Yinglang Sole Champion; Yu Xiwei Leads from Start to Finish <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Men's 100-meter Final: The men's 100-meter final started after three false starts. Xu Tiande, having the earliest start, jumped out first and took the lead. Shanghai's Wang Songtao and Rong Chengbiu, along with Taiwan's famous general Xu Tong, advanced shoulder to shoulder, vying fiercely. Initially, Xu Tong held an advantage, but after running 50 meters, Wang Songtao vigorously surpassed him, and Rong Chengbiu followed closely behind. By this time, Xu Tong was gradually falling behind. Towards the final ten meters, Xu Tiande sprinted powerfully, breaking the white line first with a time of 11.1 seconds. Following him, Shanghai's Wang and Rong surpassed Xu Tong, ranking second and third respectively, with times around 11.2-11.3 seconds. Taiwan's Lin Qiujiang finished fifth, and Malaya's Yang Chunmei finished sixth. Guangdong's Zhong Yiyan and the Air Force's Leng Peishu were both eliminated.</p>
<p>1500-meter Final: The 1500-meter final started with twelve participants. Among those participating in this event were veteran Yu Xiwei and excellent athletes like Yang Liansheng and Liu Jingxian. As expected, the veteran Yu secured the championship. After starting for twenty meters, Yu Xiwei seized the inner lane and took the lead. At that time, Liaoning's Cao Daojian, the Navy's Liu Jingkun, and Zhejiang's Wu Jianhao, full of spirit, followed closely behind, while Hubei's famous general Yang Shusheng lingered in fifth or sixth place. Thus, after eight hundred meters, Yu Xiwei still led, but Yang Liansheng had already surpassed the others and began competing with Liu Jingxian for second place. Simultaneously, Henan's Fu Yanwen, the Army's Ni Qiu, and the Air Force's Xue Pengkui gradually emerged, while Cao Daojian and Wu Jianhao, who had initially followed closely behind the old Yu, fell behind due to insufficient stamina. Towards the final hundred meters, Hubei's Yang Liansheng had already surpassed Liu Jingkun, closely pursuing Yu Xiwei. In the approximately twenty-meter stretch in front of the West Command stage, Yang Liansheng was seen sprinting fiercely, competing fiercely alongside the old Yu. However, in the final five meters, Yu Xiwei ultimately broke the white line by a step, maintaining his past reputation. The time was four minutes and seventeen seconds, breaking Zheng Sen's previous meet record of four minutes and twenty-one seconds.</p>
<p>High Hurdles Final: In the men's ten high hurdles final, unsurprisingly, Malaya's Huang Liangzheng, who had the best time in the preliminary rounds, achieved the same time of exactly sixteen seconds in both the semi-finals and finals, breaking Lin Shaozhou's previous meet record of sixteen point two seconds. His hurdling posture was beautiful, his footwork correct and elastic, and his performance greatly improved compared to the preliminary rounds. Second place went to Beiping's Xu Baochen, only half a hurdle behind, and his time was also very good. Malaya's Chen Jinji was third, Taiwan's Lai Youde was fourth, Shanghai's Li Zhenzhong lacked stamina in the later stages and finished fifth, and Guangdong's Sun Jun finished sixth. The high hurdles final was also one of yesterday's best-performing events.</p>
<p>1500-meter Medley Relay Final: In the 1500-meter medley relay final, Taiwan once again took the sole lead. Baton passes were calculated with double weight, adding fourteen points to Taiwan's score, further boosting their momentum. The Shanghai team fought hard and finished second, about ten meters behind. Eight teams participated in the final. In the first leg, the Navy's Wang Jingwu took the lead, followed by Shanghai's Tan Qing and Taiwan's Xu Tong. In the second leg, Shanghai's Rong Chengbiu broke away, followed by Taiwan's Zhang Xingxian and the Navy's Wang Dezhi. In the third leg, the 400-meter leg, Taiwan's Chen Wenyan surpassed Shanghai's Lin Canran, widening the distance, while the Navy's Zhang Zhiqing remained in third place. In the final 800-meter leg, Taiwan's general Chen Yinglang sped away, sealing the victory. Shanghai's Wu Zhonghai was no match for him, finishing fifteen meters behind in second place. Third place went to the Navy, fourth to Gansu, fifth to the police, and sixth to the Air Force, with a time of three minutes, thirty-four and three-fifths seconds.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Women's High Jump Final: Wu Shusen Takes the Top Spot, Breaking the National Record with 1.40 Meters <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The women's high jump final began yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:00 PM. A total of twenty-seven athletes actually participated in the preliminary rounds. As the competition neared its end, a heavy downpour suddenly began. After half an hour, the rain gradually subsided, and the competition continued. As predicted by this newspaper yesterday, Hebei's Wu Shusen, with an outstanding performance of 1.40 meters, broke Zhu Tianzhen's previous national record of 1.355 meters and won the championship. Second place went to Guangdong's Huang Zangping, who also broke Tang Ruirong's previous meet record of 1.320 meters with a height of 1.33 meters. Achieving such excellent results in rainy weather is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's women's high jump started at 1.20 meters, which everyone cleared easily. Subsequently, the bar was gradually raised to 1.27 meters, which fewer than ten people were able to clear. When the bar was raised to 1.30 meters, Wu Shusen, Huang Zangping, and Wang Honglan all cleared it on their first attempt. Lin Zhenji and Chen Yingzhen cleared it on their second attempt. Qiu Yuejiao failed to clear it in three attempts and finished last among the six finalists. When the bar was raised to 1.33 meters, only Wu Shusen and Huang Zangping cleared it with ease. The remaining competitors were eliminated one after another. When the bar was raised to 1.36 meters, Wu Shusen cleared it on her first attempt, while Huang Zangping failed to clear it in three attempts and was eliminated. At this point, only Wu Shusen remained to jump for the record. When the bar was raised again to 1.40 meters, against the wind and light rain, Wu Shusen failed in two attempts. Finally, summoning all her strength, she cleared it on her third attempt, with some distance to spare between her and the bar. When the bar was raised again to 1.42 meters, Wu Shusen failed in two attempts. On her third attempt, she had already run close to the bar, but likely due to a miscalculation of her steps, she charged forward but did not jump. Thus, her highest recorded height was 1.40 meters. In yesterday's women's high jump, the results for third, fourth, and fifth place were all 1.30 meters. The final rankings were determined based on the number of successful clearances. Fourth place went to Nanjing's Lin Zhenji, who was short and agile. During her jumps, she used the Western roll style, which was accurate and aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, she injured her hip when jumping 1.24 meters, limiting her highest result to 1.30 meters. Given time, her future potential is limitless. Here is a summary of the rankings and results for the top six finishers:</p>
<p>First place: Wu Shusen (Hebei) 1.40 meters (breaks the national record)</p>
<p>Second place: Huang Zangping (Guangdong) 1.33 meters (breaks the meet record)</p>
<p>Third place: Wang Hongguan (Qingdao) 1.30 meters</p>
<p>Fourth place: Lin Zhenji (Beijing) 1.30 meters</p>
<p>Fifth place: Chen Yingzhen (Shanghai) 1.30 meters</p>
<p>Sixth place: Qiu Yuejiao (Taiwan) 1.27 meters</p>

<p>Air Force's Wang Rui Holds Advantage in Javelin</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In yesterday's men's field events, there were finals for both javelin and long jump. The javelin competition started at 3:00 PM, and the long jump competition started at 3:40 PM. However, both events were halted midway due to rain. After several throws in the javelin competition, no one managed to exceed the 50-meter mark. Only six or seven people exceeded 40 meters. Among them, the Air Force's Wang Rui held a relative advantage, with a result of approximately 46 meters. The Navy's Wang Xuewu was still recovering from a waist injury, and his performance was unlikely to improve. He stated that due to recent lack of practice and the softness of the javelin shafts used at the meet, his results were significantly affected. The Navy's Wang Rui also shared the same sentiment regarding the softness of the javelin shafts. Wang Rui is tall and strong, and only twenty-five years old. He has achieved a javelin throw of 51.2 meters, but he believes that the overcast weather yesterday afternoon also negatively impacted his true potential.</p>

Regarding the selection of track and field and swimming athletes, Xia proposed dividing the selection into preliminary and final rounds. Due to the pressing time constraints, it was originally planned to use the results of the All-China Games as the final selection. After discussion, the proposal was unanimously approved. Training was scheduled to begin on May 20th and end at the end of June, with departure in early July. The training location was changed to Shanghai.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The men's middleweight weightlifting competition continued at the Guoshu Field at 2:00 PM yesterday. The results saw Malayan weightlifting expert Koo Rong Tang overwhelming the remaining Shanghai and Guangzhou athletes with absolute dominance. However, all four athletes broke the national record of 502.5 pounds from the 6th National Games, making it a truly valuable achievement for this year's games. The light heavyweight weightlifting competition was halted midway due to rain and has been rescheduled to continue at the same location at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The middleweight weightlifting results are listed below:</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the football competition. There were two matches each at the Athletics Field and Yiyuan in the morning, and two matches at Yiyuan in the afternoon. The results saw Hong Kong defeat the Navy 2-1, Zhejiang defeat the Air Force 2-1, Dalian defeat Guangdong 3-1, the Army easily defeat Guizhou 7-0, Malaya defeat Nanjing 5-1, and Shanghai defeat Hubei 3-1. Except for Dalian's particularly spirited performance in overpowering Guangdong in extra time, the rest were within this newspaper's predictions yesterday. The weather was very good yesterday morning, and there were many spectators at both the Athletics Field and Yiyuan. However, a sudden downpour occurred after 4:00 PM, and the Army and Guizhou teams completed their match in the heavy rain. During the Guangdong vs. Dalian match, Dalian questioned the referee Zhang Le regarding the shortening of the second half, accusing him of favoring Guangdong. After an explanation, the dispute was quickly resolved.</p>
<p>After three days of intense competition involving twenty-one football teams, thirteen teams will gradually enter the elimination matches starting today. The final eight teams in the championship are: Malaya, Army, Dalian, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Zhejiang, Siam, and Police. Starting tomorrow, they will be divided into four groups to compete for the final four spots.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Hong Kong vs. Navy Thriller Most Exciting; Navy Loses in Extra Time <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong vs. Navy match was the most exciting event in yesterday's football competition. Both sides were strong and played with great tension. Less than two minutes after the kickoff at 9:00 AM, the Navy's Xie Jinchuan scored a goal, breaking the Hong Kong goal. The Hong Kong team, having defeated the World Games representative team 3-1, felt greatly renowned. Unexpectedly, they were at a disadvantage from the start and fought back vigorously. The two teams engaged in fierce back-and-forth battles. The Navy's Qiang Yuanzhi and Jing Guilin were injured and left the field, but they continued to defend strongly. The Hong Kong team achieved nothing in the first half. In the second half, the two teams fought even more fiercely. Two minutes before the end of the match, Hong Kong's left winger Li Shuoyou lightly tapped the ball from the halfway line, and the ball slowly rolled into the net, resulting in a tie. After extra time, the Hong Kong team got a corner kick opportunity. Li Shuoyou passed to Zhong Canguang, who headed the ball into the goal. The Hong Kong team came from behind, defeating the Navy 2-1.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang-Air Force soccer match began at eleven o'clock, with both sides evenly matched and the situation extremely tense. In the first half, Wu Binghao of the Zhejiang team scored a goal, and in the second half, Zhang Jie of the Zhejiang team scored another. Although the Air Force team responded with one goal, they ultimately lost by a one-goal difference. Moments after the end of the match, the Air Force team players began chasing and attacking the Zhejiang team players. Lu Bingsheng, the center forward of the Zhejiang team, was seriously injured in the beating and was rushed to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment, where he remained under care until late in the evening. The Zhejiang team members were extremely indignant at being humiliated for no reason and intended to confront the Air Force team as a group. The spectators in the stands also shouted and cheered, causing temporary chaos. Fortunately, Hu Weike, the leader of the Air Force team, and the security team arrived in time to mediate, and both sides then turned to off-field negotiations.</p>
<p>Yesterday's lineups for both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang</p>
<p>Liao Xiong</p>

<p>Malaya Lightly Defeats Nanjing</p>
<p>The match between Malaya and Nanjing started at 9:00 AM at Yiyuan. The Nanjing team was mainly composed of strong athletes from National Central University, supplemented by good players from Jinling University and other strong teams in the capital. Their defense was good, but their midfield and forward lines were too weak. The Malaya team gathered elites from the South Seas. Although their main players were scattered, their strength was not as great as when they conquered Shanghai before, but they were still not a match for the capital's setup. After the match began, the game was a melee until the 20th minute when Li Sida kicked the ball into the net, putting Malaya ahead 1-0. In the 25th minute, Nanjing's Hu Zhisui crossed the ball, and Guo Bingyan got a perfect header, tying the score in the first half at 1-1.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Malaya headed in a goal after more than nine minutes, making it 2-1. In the 22nd minute, Huang Jinbi lofted a high ball from midfield, and with the momentum of the ball and the wind, it hit the bullseye. Three minutes later, Liang Kaiming took a corner kick, and in the ensuing chaos, the Nanjing defender accidentally scored an own goal. In the last minute, Li Sixuan once again outmaneuvered the defense, went in alone, and added another goal, resulting in a 5-1 victory for Malaya.</p>
<p>Shanghai Forces Back Victory Over Hubei</p>
<p>The match between Shanghai and Hubei started at 10:30 AM. The first half ended 0-0. After the refreshment break, Lin Gen left his defense far out, and Ji Haitao took advantage of the opening, rushing straight in and scoring the first goal. Shanghai launched a desperate counterattack. You Liang lightly passed to Long Hai on the right wing. Long Hai lobbed the ball to Ah Sun, who unleashed a powerful kick, breaking through the goal and tying the score. The morale of the Shanghai team soared, and they scored two goals in quick succession within three minutes, reversing the defeat. In the 27th minute, Long Hai broke through the defense and went straight in, but Fan Xiwu tripped him, violating the rules and resulting in a penalty kick. Li Yao officiated, and with a powerful kick, the ball went into the goal. The Shanghai team ultimately won 3-1.</p>
<p>Dalian Defeats Guangzhou</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, Guangdong played against Dalian. Less than five minutes into the game, Dalian took the lead with a goal. Guangdong counterattacked and, after a series of attacks, in the tenth minute Dalian conceded a penalty, which was taken by Hou Chengtuo, who scored with one kick. However, the Guangdong forward was offside, and Zhang Le ordered a retake. He Chi still shot to the left corner, hitting the bullseye again and forcing a tie. For the next sixty minutes, neither side could score. In the seventh minute of extra time, Yan Chengkuan scored with a powerful shot from 30 yards out, demoralizing the Lingnan athletes. Before the end of the match, Chengkuan lobbed another goal into the empty net, leading to a 3-1 defeat for Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Army Heavily Defeats Guizhou</p>
<p>The match between the Army and Guizhou was held in torrential rain. Guizhou's strength was weak and could not withstand the attack. The Army freely entered Guizhou's defense and scored at will, winning 7-0.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Football Match Incident: Zhejiang Team Withdraws Protest, Navy Reports Events <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Two incidents occurred during yesterday's football match:</p>
<p>(1) After the Air Force team beat Zhejiang team player Lu Bingsheng, the Zhejiang provincial delegation expressed their determination to lodge a protest with the organizing committee. Upon learning of this, Hu Weike, the leader of the Air Force team, personally went to the Zhejiang team to formally apologize to the entire team. He stated that before the match, he had repeatedly warned the Air Force team to strictly abide by the rules, but the incident still occurred. He expressed regret over the team members' disregard for sportsmanship and the injury to the Zhejiang team player, and he was willing to bear all medical expenses. Li Chaoqing, the leader of the Zhejiang team, recognizing Hu's acceptance of responsibility and his efforts to quell the situation, found his sincerity touching and immediately expressed his willingness to withdraw the protest. However, to uphold the spirit of the games, he will submit a separate report to the organizing committee.</p>
<p>(2) In the Navy vs. Hong Kong match, the Hong Kong team won 2-1. According to the Navy team representative, the Navy team scored one goal in the first half. In the second half, more than three minutes had passed beyond the regulated time, but referee He Chunhui did not announce the end of the game. The Hong Kong team scored at that moment, leading to an extension of the game and an erroneous result. The Navy team believed that the referee was at fault. To comply with the spirit of the games, they obeyed the decision during the match, but after the match, they reported the facts to the chief football referee and lodged a protest.</p>

After the Guangdong team announced its forfeit, Shanghai played a friendly match against the US Military Police to entertain the hundreds of spectators who had come with anticipation.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, both male and female Kung Fu athletes continued their weapons competition at the National Martial Arts Stadium.

<h3 id="e113">Four Female High Jumpers: Champion Wu Shulin Trains Runs Every Day, Runner-Up Huang Zangping Fell But Continued To Chase, Third-Place Wang Honglan Is Elegant and Refined, Fourth-Place Lin Zhenji's Buttocks Don't Touch the Bar <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Hong Xucai</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, Wu Shusen from Beiping broke the national record in the women's high jump, and Huang Zangping from Guangdong and Guangzhou broke the National Games record. Both are rare talents. Champion Wu Shusen grew up in Beiping and is currently a freshman majoring in physical education at Beiping Normal University. She says that among all sports, she likes high jump the most. Her past achievement was 1.365 meters, winning the championship at the Beiping Xiannongtan Sports Field trials. This time participating in the National Games, she reached 1.40 meters, setting a new personal record. She practices 50-meter sprints every morning to increase her explosiveness. For many years, she has never stopped, so today's amazing achievements were not easily obtained. When it was her turn to high jump in the finals, she was very calm, running very slowly, and when she got to the bar, she jumped lightly and easily over it. Miss Wu is twenty years old, taller than average, dresses plainly, and wears a pair of glasses, probably a good student.</p>
<p>Runner-up Huang Zangping has a moderate build, an oval face, and very developed calves, with an exceptionally smart appearance. In addition to participating in the high jump and winning second place, she also participated in the women's low hurdles race. Yesterday, when starting the jump, Miss Huang was very fast, leading all the way. She thought she could score, but unfortunately, she accidentally fell when jumping the last hurdle. She quickly got up and chased, but it was already too late. Miss Huang had to wait for the next opportunity to try again.</p>
<p>The third-place high jumper, Wang Honglan, is twenty-nine years old, tall and slender, with two braids, looking elegant and refined. She is a top student at Qingdao Wende Girls' High School and this is her first time in Shanghai. She said that she has only been high jumping for a year, participating in two city games, encouraged by her teacher. The first time she won third place, and then became interested in high jump. The second time she participated, she won the championship. It seems that Miss Wang has a lot of talent. If she can work hard and train, it will not be difficult to create more brilliant achievements.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning the Nanjing athlete Lin Zhenji, who came in fourth place. She is the youngest and shortest, but her high jump posture is excellent. Her body is as light as a swallow. Every time she jumps over the bar, she rolls into the sandpit, and her buttocks never touch the bar, which shows that she has received basic training. Lin Zhenji is dressed like a boy, wearing shorts and a shirt, as well as a red and white watermelon-shaped hat. Once, when high jumping, her whole body passed over the bar, leaving only the little hat dangling on the bar, causing everyone to laugh. Unfortunately, when Lin Zhenji jumped over 1.24 meters, her calf suddenly cramped, but after applying turpentine and massaging it slightly, she continued to jump. Unfortunately, because the sandpit was too hard, she fell outside the sandpit and injured her buttocks, and was unable to get up for a long time. She was carried out of the stadium by the Boy Scout stretcher team for treatment. Her highest record stopped at 1.30 meters. Lin Zhenji is young and strong, and her movements are on the right track. As long as she can continue to train, her future is limitless.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Women's Volleyball Semifinals Revealed: Shanghai, Taiwan, Hunan, and Guangdong Named as Final Four, Victory Determined Through Thrilling Battles <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A total of nine teams participated in the women's volleyball competition. Yesterday's semifinal results produced the final four teams: Shanghai, Taiwan, Hunan, and Guangdong. The four teams will compete in a round-robin tournament starting on the 9th to determine the first, second, third, and fourth places. In yesterday's game, Jiangxi forfeited, and Shanghai won without a fight. In the other three games, Hunan defeated Zhejiang, Taiwan defeated Qingdao, and Guangdong defeated Henan.</p>
<p>Hunan's Fierce Women Achieve Great Victory</p>
<p>The Hunan and Zhejiang teams fought fiercely yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The Hunan team won a great victory, with a score of two to zero. In terms of strength, the Hunan and Zhejiang teams are not very different. However, Hunan's front row has a strong player, Zheng Peikun, who is good at smashing and blocking. She is also good at taking advantage of weaknesses, while Zhejiang's front row lacks blockers, and the second row is busy defending, forming a defensive posture. The points lost in this way in each set reached more than ten points, which was Zhejiang's fatal blow. The scores of the two sets were: 21-12 and 21-10.</p>
<p>Interlude in a Friendship Match</p>
<p>After the Hunan-Zhejiang match, the Shanghai team invited the Zhejiang team for a friendly match for observation. All the Taiwan team members also came to watch. The result of the first set was 21-12, with Shanghai winning. Then the Zhejiang team requested to end the match. This friendly women's volleyball viewing match came to an end.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Hard-Won Victory</p>
<p>The Taiwan women's team, which defeated Andong the day before, defeated Qingdao again 2-1 yesterday afternoon. As soon as the match began, both sides showed their confidence in winning and launched heroic attacks. It was the most intense and thrilling volleyball duel of the day. Taiwan is good at offensive tactics, but Qingdao is not passively beaten. Each player gave their best, but they were defeated due to an unfavorable start. The scores were: 18-21, 21-9, and 21-5.</p>
<p>Guangdong and Henan Fight Desperately</p>
<p>In the match between Guangzhou and Henan, the former won 2-0. Guangzhou could have won easily, but they performed abnormally, making the game very thrilling. The scores of the two sets were 21-19 and 21-18.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Men's Basketball Third Week: Air Force vs. Guizhou, Both Sides Play With Hard-Line Style, Guizhou is Brave But Lacks Strategy and Falls Short <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The basketball games of the 7th National Games have entered the third week. United Logistics won against Hong Kong, Shanghai won against Guangdong, Shenyang won against Nanjing, Tianjin won against Jiangsu, and Air Force won against Guizhou. The first half of the Air Force vs. Guizhou match was the most exciting. Yesterday, there were also matches between the Philippines vs. Army, Malaya vs. Navy, and Fujian vs. Police, all of which were strong battles. Unfortunately, due to torrential rain, the matches had to be postponed to today.</p>
<p>United Logistics Wins Against Hong Kong</p>
<p>The match started at 9:00 AM. Hong Kong's Li Zhuomin scored first, but was immediately caught up by United Logistics' Cao Zhiji. Bu Yanshi added two more points, and Liao Dihang added the finishing touch, making it 6-2. After that, United Logistics took the lead and was unstoppable. Hong Kong also did not show weakness and remained calm. In this match, United Logistics adopted a five-man zone defense. Wang Shixuan was the soul of the team, and Jia Zhijun specialized in passing and shooting for the forwards. Their spirit of cooperation was rare among the teams. The team's tactics have been completely renewed, and they also have feints when necessary, but fewer than the Shanghai team. Hong Kong adopted a zone defense, which was also not weak, but because United Logistics' movements were fast and agile, and they were also full of energy, Hong Kong was no match for them. Hong Kong's Zhang Shurong was more accurate in shooting. He scored sixteen points in yesterday's match, but United Logistics' quick penetration led to a 58-36 defeat for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>United Logistics Team (Fouls) (Points)</p>
<p>Wang Shixuan 4 1</p>
<p>Jia Zhijun 0 9</p>
<p>Bu Yanshi 0 7</p>
<p>Liao Dihang 3 21</p>

<p>Shanghai Wins Against Guangdong</p>
<p>The match was held at the sixth court at 9:00 AM. Shanghai started with Da Li, Wenhua, Chengzhang, Songyuan, and Yingke. Chengzhang made both free throws, and Zhao Bin scored a goal, tying the score at 2-2. Lianke and Zhenzhong then broke through, and Shanghai took the lead. Guangdong's shooting was inaccurate, and long-range passes were intercepted by Shanghai. Shanghai controlled the ball under both baskets. After 12-2, Guangdong took advantage of their opponent's lack of energy and scored several goals. At the end of the first half, Shanghai led 23-10. In the second half, all of Shanghai's players came on the field, launching a wheel war. The Guangdong team took the opportunity to catch up, forcing the score to 31-22. Shanghai then put their best lineup back on the field. Wenhua, Chengzhang, and Songyuan used skillful passing, and the score soared again, ending at 58-32.</p>
<p>Shenyang Wins Against Nanjing</p>
<p>The match was held at the original venue at 10:00 AM. Nanjing started strong but then weakened. In the first half, they led by six points, but due to a lack of stamina, Shenyang took advantage of their physical advantage in the second half, using volleyball-style passing to great effect. They quickly surpassed Nanjing, and the result was 59-42. In the first half, Nanjing led 25-19. Shenyang scored as many as 40 points in the second half, reversing the defeat.</p>
<p>Tianjin Wins Against Jiangsu</p>
<p>The match was held at 3:00 PM. Tianjin did not show their lively talent in the match against Zhejiang, but they played to the fullest against Jiangsu, resulting in a one-sided game, winning 72-26.</p>
<p>Air Force Wins Against Guizhou</p>
<p>The match was held at 3:00 PM. Both the Air Force and Guizhou teams wagered on physical strength. At first, Guizhou scored, and the defenders fouled, resulting in penalties for the Air Force. After that, the competition was fierce. Guizhou captain Guo Jiandong was injured in the corner of his eye and left the field. He was replaced by Song Jianzhong, who used his speed to assist the forwards. When a shot missed, Song chased after it and jumped up for a rebound, and the ball went into the net, drawing cheers from the crowd. At this time, the Air Force's strong attack began, but Guizhou was also brave, unyielding, and resisted stubbornly. However, because Guizhou's physical strength was not as good as the Air Force's, they frequently lost ground in the last ten minutes of the second half, resulting in a 68-49 defeat. This battle showed that Guizhou's individual techniques were excellent, but they did not pay attention to strategy and tactics, which was the main reason for their failure.</p>

<p>Yesterday's basketball game was the third week, so it was unusually tense and exciting.</p>
<p>The audience arrived at the stadium at 7:00 AM and did not leave until 12:00 PM, showing no signs of fatigue. The game started at 3:00 PM, and the basketball stadium was full by 12:00 PM, demonstrating the large number of basketball fans in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It started raining at 4:00 PM, and the rain gradually increased, but the audience refused to leave. Some hid under the footboards of the stands, and even though they were soaked, they still wanted to see the athletes in action.</p>
<p>The audience's favorite players were Liao Dihang of United Logistics, Huang Longsheng of Guizhou, You Jianxing of the Air Force, and Chen Jinzhi and Chen Jinde of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Miss You loves basketball, and about four out of ten female audience members were there to see the game. Some men who may not love basketball were only accompanying their girlfriends.</p>
<p>The most nervous people in the stadium were the fans, especially the female fans. Every time a player shot, they were anxious for them. When a player shot the ball and it rolled on the rim of the basket, the female fans shouted "Oh no!" And when the ball went in, they shouted "Good!"</p>
<p>Some fans were betting on the outcome of the game, which added to the excitement.</p>
<p>Even though it was still early before the start of the game, airplanes soared in the sky, distributing promotional materials, but the fans were unmoved, because if they went to get the promotional materials, they would lose their seat.</p>
<p>Some players brought their girlfriends, and the girlfriends would clap when the players scored. When it was a tense moment, they would clench their teeth, hold their hands, and watch with bated breath. It is said that Miss ×'s handkerchief was completely soaked from the start to the end of the game.</p>
<p>Guizhou and the Navy, many of the Navy players were trained in Guiyang during the war, and most of the Air Force players were also trained in Guiyang, so even though the battle was very tense, the atmosphere was always harmonious.</p>
<p>When it rained, the matches between the Philippines vs. Army, Malaya vs. Navy, and Police vs. Fujian had just begun. The rain poured down, and the audience and players all went to take shelter from the rain, but after more than twenty minutes, they still had not left the stadium, waiting for the referee's decision on whether to continue the game. The news reporters standing in the rain were the most miserable. (Yusheng)</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the basketball games of Malaya vs. Navy and Police vs. Fujian were played at the same time. Malaya faced the Navy, and the Police faced Fujian. The two sides were evenly matched, and it was expected that there would be exciting performances, so the audience was particularly crowded. Unfortunately, because the two games were held at the same time, people felt like they had to choose between "fish and bear's paw."</p>
<p>It was drizzling at the opening ceremony, and the games were played in the rain. Within five minutes, the rain poured down, and the referees had no choice but to announce the suspension of the games. At that time, the score of the Malaya vs. Navy game was 13-10, with the former leading. The score of the Police vs. Fujian game was 4-3, with the Police in the lead. The two exciting games will have to be rescheduled.</p>

<p>In the third match, Li Dongfen (Hong Kong) faced Su Juncai (Police). After the bell rang, both sides adopted a defensive posture for one minute, and the audience booed loudly. They hesitated for more than ten seconds before officially starting to fight. As a result, Su Juncai was unable to resist and automatically gave up, so Li Dongfen won effortlessly.</p>
<p>In the last match, Yang Jinlai (Guangdong) faced Hong Qinmao (Taiwan). The two sides were evenly matched and fought to a stalemate. The winner was decided by points. As a result, Yang Jinlai won with 20 points to 18 and one-third points.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Central Bank Notifies Designated Banks of Changes to Import Exchange Settlement Methods: Settlement Based on Exchange Rate When Goods Actually Arrive at Port <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Central Bank and the Import and Export Control Commission yesterday notified designated banks of some changes to import exchange settlement methods. A reporter specifically visited the responsible authorities, who stated that in the past, after obtaining an import license, foreign exchange could be purchased at the current exchange rate. However, the selling price of imported goods after arrival was not based on the exchange rate cost, but mostly exceeded the black market exchange rate. Recently, the black market price has skyrocketed, far exceeding the general price level, which is unreasonable. It is inevitable that the price of imported goods will follow the black market situation. To reduce this unreasonable phenomenon, when importers receive notification of an approved import license, they must first convert the foreign exchange amount into local currency at the current exchange rate and deposit 50% as a security deposit. Foreign exchange will then be settled when the goods arrive. However, to gain the trust of foreign merchants, the Central Bank may first lend foreign exchange to designated banks, with the amount not exceeding the security deposit paid. Designated banks may also borrow more foreign exchange, but must make up the amount of the security deposit. This measure is entirely to ensure that the market sales price of imported goods is not too far from the import cost, in order to achieve a fair distribution of profits. Recent reports of designated banks suggesting reforms to the foreign exchange system, submitted to Mr. Bei Zuyi, are merely rumors. The modification of the import exchange settlement method proves that it does not accord with the facts. The Central Bank's Business Bureau and the Import and Export Control Commission yesterday issued Notification No. 131 to designated banks, notifying each bank to implement the following regulations regarding the exchange settlement methods for import licenses, effective immediately:</p>
<p>(1) When an importer receives notification from the Import and Export Control Commission that their application has been approved for the issuance of an import license, they must immediately deposit 50% of the foreign exchange amount stated on the license with the Central Bank, converted into local currency at the current market price. This deposit can serve as a deposit for letters of credit or purchase orders opened by designated banks.</p>
<p>(2) Importers must present the official deposit receipt issued by the Central Bank to the Import and Export Control Commission to obtain the import license.</p>
<p>(3) For import licenses issued on or after May 7 of this year, designated banks must verify that the relevant goods have already arrived at a domestic port before settling the foreign exchange under the license with the importer.</p>
<p>(4) The Central Bank will provide foreign exchange loans to designated banks to pay for drafts under letters of credit and/or purchase orders issued by the designated banks. The amount will be limited to the value of the local currency deposit on the date of the loan. If designated banks require more foreign exchange than the value of the local currency deposit, they may increase the local currency deposit, calculated at the market price on the date of the increased loan.</p>
<p>(5) The Central Bank's foreign exchange loans will only be provided to the relevant designated banks, and the banks will bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>(6) When applying for foreign exchange loans, designated banks must specify in detail: (A) letter of credit and/or purchase order, (B) import license, (C) loan term. Extensions of this loan must be approved by the Central Bank in advance.</p>
<p>(7) If the amount of the letter of credit and/or purchase order opened by the designated bank is increased due to customer needs, the local currency deposit paid to the Central Bank may be used to purchase foreign exchange in accordance with Section 3.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Rice Price Yesterday Exceeded Previous Closing Price; People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Sells Off Large Quantities; Over 18,000 Stones Sold in North and South Markets Combined <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The price of rice rose sharply again yesterday. In the South Market, the highest price for Japanese rice reached 5.1 million yuan. The authorities immediately began unlimited supply in both the North and South markets at 9:30 AM, setting the price of white rice at 4.6 million yuan in the South Market and 4.65 million yuan in the North Market, and early rice at 4.45 million yuan in both markets. Each merchant in the South Market could purchase 50 stones of white rice and early rice each, while merchants in the North Market could purchase 40 stones. Public sentiment stabilized, and many adopted a wait-and-see attitude. A total of 13,500 stones of rice were sold in the South Market and 4,880 stones in the North Market. The South Market closed with white rice at 4.6 million yuan, thin rice at 4.65 million yuan, and early rice at 4.5 million yuan, with 2,774 stones arriving. The North Market's closing price was similar to the previous day, with 2,826 stones arriving.</p>
<p>Flour prices opened above the price limit, with off-market trading occurring secretly. Old "Che Bing Chuan" brand once reached 1.76 million yuan, but later retreated to 1.72 million, still up 70,000-80,000 yuan. "Red Bee" and "Jiancheng" brands both closed at 1.68 million yuan. Bran was scarcely traded, with prices quoted as high as 1.2 million yuan. In the afternoon, small bags of bran were priced at 780,000 yuan, and flour mills added 100,000 yuan to the price.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains generally rose, with soybeans being purchased by Shantou merchants. "Zha" beans and others surged by more than 200,000 yuan. Corn was further absorbed by Qingdao merchants, rising by 100,000 yuan, and red sorghum increased by more than 100,000 yuan. Green beans were also intermittently traded by Hakka merchants, rising by 200,000-300,000 yuan. Selected green beans were rarely traded, and the market also rose. Raw peanuts were not sold at all, so no price was opened, but the quoted price rose by a huge 1 million yuan. Raw peanuts from Qinhuangdao reached the 10 million mark, rising by 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil trading came to a standstill because the authorities notified that transactions could not exceed the previous day's closing price, causing sellers to be unwilling to sell. Later, the opening price for old-barrel raw oil was quoted at 13.5 million yuan, and soybean oil at 11.5 million yuan, an increase of about 1 million yuan. Small-cart sesame oil was quoted as high as 1.53 million yuan, an increase of 1.8 million yuan. Soybean cake also did not open, with a quoted price of 1.2 million yuan, but it was impossible to buy.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Market Conditions in Various Places <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin [Reported by our newspaper, Tianjin, 7th] The rising tide swept the Tianjin market, with rumors of all kinds. On the 7th, flour already showed a high price of 3.1 million yuan, rice 5.7 million yuan, 20-count "Three Ding" yarn 172 million yuan, and "Five Blessings" cloth 6.34 million yuan, with prices of all goods rising firmly.</p>
<p>Beiping [Reported by our newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The rising tide hit the ancient capital fiercely, and the gold standard also rose several levels. The black market price of gold was rumored to have reached 5,600, American dollars 115, top-quality flour 250,000,000,000 per catty, and "Haichang" blue cloth 7.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Wuhu [Reported by our newspaper, Wuhu, 7th] Rice prices soared. Today, machine-milled rice is 4.8 million yuan, and brown rice is also 4.2 million yuan. Prices of all goods are also rising.</p>
<p>Taiyuan [Reported by our newspaper, Taiyuan, 7th] Shanxi finance was affected by fluctuations in other areas, and prices have risen dramatically in the past three days. Grain prices, which had been stable for many days, have risen sharply again. Millet has risen by about 5 million yuan per stone, breaking the 20 million mark. Bagged flour is over 7 million yuan, and sorghum has risen again to 100,000 yuan per catty. Silver dollars reached a new high.</p>
<p>Hefei Prices here have been led by gold in recent days, rising in a straight line. Today, gold is selling for 66 million "old taels," and top-quality rice is 4 million yuan, up 30%. Pork is 100,000 yuan, up 40%, and there are no sales. "Five Oceans" cloth is also rising.</p>
<p>Jinan [Reported by our newspaper, Jinan, 7th] Price fluctuations here are unprecedentedly fierce. Gold rose to 65 million yuan per tael at noon on the 7th, 20-count "Spider" yarn 172 million yuan per piece, and kerosene rose to 25 million yuan per large barrel.</p>
<p>Wuxi [Reported by our newspaper, Wuxi, 7th] This morning, prices continued to soar. After the authorities arrested a large number of speculators, the soaring trend eased in the afternoon. White rice was 5.226 million yuan, "Bai Yuan" rice 5.386 million yuan, "Yang Xian" rice 5.076 million yuan, "Bu Xian" rice 5.106 million yuan, wheat 4.8 million yuan, white wheat 510,000 yuan, flour 1.735 million yuan, soybean oil 11.05 million yuan, and cotton yarn 178 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Yarn and Cloth Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was lively due to various favorable rumors. Merchants from Tianjin, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other regions continued to purchase actively, and merchants outside the industry strongly boosted prices. The market was filled with buying sentiment, and the market soared. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn opened at a jump of 21 million yuan. When news spread of rising cloth prices, a wave of buying occurred, and the market rose again to a new high of 314 million yuan. Around 10:30 AM, the authorities suddenly posted a notice, accepting applications from the industry, and public sentiment turned uncertain. Merchants sold off their holdings, and the market price fell back to a closing price of 304 million yuan, still a substantial increase of 20 million yuan compared to the previous day. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn also reached a peak of 220 million yuan, but there were not many buyers, and it ultimately rose by 13 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of fine yarn also continued to rise by 8-9 million to 14.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with prices appearing stable but secretly firm. The market was flooded with speculative capital, and merchants purchased actively. Dyeing factories, having sold off a significant amount of colored cloth in the previous two days, also showed strong demand for gray cloth. Cloth merchants and retailers seized the opportunity to boost prices, and speculative sentiment soared, leading to new high prices. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose sharply by 280,000 yuan at the opening, breaking the 6 million yuan mark. With demand exceeding supply, the market rose all the way to 6.45 million yuan. Near the close, there were profit-taking sales, and prices fell back to close at 6.32 million yuan, a jump of 540,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other fine cloths, rents, twills, and serges also generally rose sharply. Shilin cloth dyeing factories temporarily suspended sales, and very little trading occurred. The final transaction price for "Dragon Head" fine cloth was 6.3 million yuan. Purchase orders for "Laba" children's fine cloth supplied by the previous day's textile mills increased to 400,000 yuan, and the market sentiment was increasingly strong.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Hong Kong, 7th] Following a weekend of decline, Hong Kong's financial and gold markets opened weak on the 7th, except for the British pound. The main reason was a lack of buying interest in various parts of China. The fall in gold prices was due to the fact that 50,000 ounces of gold came from Macau this week, while sales in China were only 20,000 ounces. The opening and closing prices on the 7th are listed below (unit: Hong Kong dollars):</p>
<p>Opening Closing</p>
<p>Gold per tael 332.00 332.50</p>
<p>US dollar per dollar 5.45 5.46</p>
<p>National currency per million 6.00 6.50</p>
<p>British pound per pound 13.70 13.85</p>

<p>The newly appointed Chairman of the Bank of China, Mr. Song Hanzhang, and the General Manager, Mr. Xi Demao, are scheduled to take office today (8th). Mr. Song and Mr. Xi will also address all bank employees at 8:30 AM today and will hold a public reception for various sectors at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e128">"Yong Yarn" Reaches 3,000 Yuan Mark; Sudden Reversal and Plunge Near the Close <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Driven by financial stocks, materials, and Hong Kong Electric, "Yong" yarn saw a new high price of 3,020 yuan. However, those in the industry, under the surveillance of the multilateral forces, once Guangdong merchants made a secret sale, immediately reversed the trend and plunged near the close. The morning began uncertainly, with yarn and cloth still popular. "Yong" yarn opened at 2,900 yuan and "Xinghe" opened high at 1,120 yuan. After the opening, people were anxious about the foreign exchange rate's prolonged absence, and prices fluctuated, returning to 2,870 yuan. With no change in the exchange rate, prices fell to a low of 2,855 yuan. External stimulation was strong, rising to 2,960 yuan. Brokerage fees opened high at 31 yuan and 35 yuan, then retreated to 2,870 yuan. Guangdong merchants purchased actively, rising to a new high of 2,975 yuan. Near noon, it fell to a low of 2,865 yuan, closing the morning at 2,890 yuan. Except for "Hengfeng" rising to the limit, "China Cement" rising by half a percent, "Yong" yarn, "Huaxin," "Xinyi," "Jinglun," and "Commercial Press" rising slightly, "China-France," "America-Asia," "Xinghe," "Huafeng," "Tongyi," "China Silk," "Xinhua," and "Zhabei" falling by half a percent, the rest experienced slight declines.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at 2,960 yuan and once retreated to 2,920 yuan. The national banks made only a few purchases, buyers rose, and Hong Kong Electric also contracted, rising to a new high of 3,020 yuan. After 3:15 PM, the wind began to change, with reports of authorities intensifying countermeasures. The reaction began and could not be sold off, and mixed stocks became difficult to trade. Prices suddenly fell to a low of 2,820 yuan, closing at only 2,830 yuan. Compared to the last close, "Datong" and "China Cement" were flat, "Zhabei," "Lianan," and "China Silk" rose slightly, "China-France," "Xinyi," "Xinghe," "Xinhua," "Jinglun," and "Hengfeng" fell by half a percent, and the rest declined slightly. Among the unlisted stocks traded off-market, bank stocks rose the most, increasing by one percent, and the rest ranged from slightly higher to half a percent.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Yesterday saw a minor rally. "Tong Bing" opened at 187,000, falling from a high of 200,000 to 183,000 before stabilizing slightly. Compared to the previous day, all bonds rose by 1,000 to 4,000 yuan. 6 million yuan were traded.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Yesterday continued to be stimulated by Hong Kong Electric. "Yi" yarn rose from a new high of 5.1 million yuan, briefly retreating to 4.97 million, and remaining stable near the close. Banks and money houses offered supply, while securities and foreign houses entered. As a result, compared to the previous close, rubber stocks and plantations rose by one percent, and the rise and fall of other stocks were slight.</p>

<h3 id="e129">On the Twelve Times of the Day <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Chongmin</p>
<p>I have seen nineteen manuscripts of the Twelve Times of the Day from Dunhuang, which, after removing duplicates and collating, amount to ten types.</p>
<p>(1) *Sacred Teachings for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 2 scrolls, Pelliot 2918, 2734</p>
<p>(2) *Dharma Body for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 3 scrolls, Pelliot 4028, 2813, 3113</p>
<p>(3) *Learning the Way for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 2943</p>
<p>(4) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 3 scrolls, Pelliot 3604, 3116, scroll collected by Luo Zhenyu</p>
<p>(5) *Written by Secretary Bai, Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 3821</p>
<p>(6) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day Throughout the World*, 1 scroll, collected by Luo Zhenyu</p>
<p>(7) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 2 scrolls, Pelliot 3821, Stein 4129</p>
<p>(8) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 3821</p>
<p>(9) *"Vimalakirti" for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 3141</p>
<p>(10) *General Exhortation for the Four Assemblies to Practice According to the Teachings for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 4 scrolls, Pelliot 2714, 2054, 3286, 3087</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the division of the day into twelve times, and the origins of matching the twelve times with the twelve branches and the twelve names such as "Midnight" and "Cockcrow."</p>
<p>Dividing the day and night into twelve times should not be later than the era of dividing the night into five watches. Using the names of the twelve branches to represent the twelve times is also a natural thing. I assume that this practice originated in the Western Han Dynasty, and this is likely not wrong. As for matching the twelve names such as "Midnight" and "Cockcrow" with the twelve branch names to record the twelve times, it seems that a system had not yet been established in the Western Han Dynasty, but they were used independently to represent segments of time. As shown by the examples given in Gu Yanwu's *Records of Daily Knowledge*, Volume 20, in the article "Anciently, There Was No Division of a Day into Twelve Times," things were very chaotic in the pre-Qin and Western Han periods. For example, as Gu mentioned, the *Book of Changes* and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* have "Midday," and the *Book of Poetry* has "The Sun is Just at Midday"; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* has "Cockcrow," the *Book of Poetry* has "Morning Meeting," and the *Book of Rites* has "Dawning," "Early Morning," "Morning Time," "Late Morning," and "Cockcrowing at Dawn." The *Huainanzi* chapter "Astronomical Training" describes the sun's journey from sunrise to sunset, passing through fifteen places and reflecting fifteen times of the day—clearly not including "Midnight" and the times adjacent to midnight. Therefore, the fifteen times of the *Huainanzi* cannot represent a whole day. However, he arranged the chaotic names into an order based on the sun's movement, which was truly the first major reorganization.</p>
<p>Neither the *Huainanzi* nor other works of the same era seem to have combined the twelve branch names with the twelve time names such as "Midnight" and "Cockcrow," because at that time, the twelve time names had not been determined or arranged. However, their arrangement and determination probably occurred in the late Western Han Dynasty. Wang Chong's *Discourses Weighed in the Balance*, Volume 23, "Times," already says:</p>
<p>"The day is divided into twelve times, dawn is Yin, sunrise is Mao." Before Wang Chong (27-?), the twelve branch names and the twelve time names were clearly used in combination and had already been arranged and determined! Du Yu (132-284) lived two hundred years after Wang Chong and used the twelve times of the day, which had long been commonly used in society, to annotate the "Ten Times" in the text of the fifth year of Duke Zhao in the *Zuo Zhuan*, naturally holding tightly to what did not fit!</p>
<p>Only after such a form was determined and popularized could the possibility of the Twelve Times Song arise!</p>
<p>Furthermore, two hundred years after Du Yu, Wang Rong (468-496) composed twelve *Dharma Music Lyrics*, telling the story of Prince Siddhartha's life, just like the style and story of the *Sacred Teachings for the Twelve Times of the Day* from Dunhuang. Therefore, I say that Wang Rong's *Dharma Music Lyrics* already had the style of the Twelve Times, but without the title of Twelve Times. The twelve *Dharma Music Lyrics* are recorded in *Collected Works for the Propagation and Illumination of Buddhism*, Volume 30.</p>
<p>Shortly after Wang Rong, there was Abbot Baozhi's *Twelve Times Praise*. The earliest source of the *Twelve Times Praise* is the *Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp*, Volume 29. Zang Maoxun's *Poems Collected*, Volume 56, and Yangshan Cheng's Volume 2 also reprint it, titled "*Twelve Times Song*." It is possible that the Twelve Times Song was already being sung in the time of Zhi Gong, but this Twelve Times Song has never been cited in books before the Zhu Dynasty; secondly, there would not have been a 3-3-7 style of song lyrics in the time of Zhi Gong, nor would there have been such good vernacular language; thirdly, Zhi Gong was slightly older than Bodhidharma and should not have praised Zen Buddhism after Bodhidharma. Therefore, I suspect that the Twelve Times attributed to Baozhi in the *Record of the Transmission of the Lamp* is somewhat unreliable. However, I am an amateur in Buddhism, so I consulted Mr. Zhou Yiliang. Mr. Zhou replied with a long letter, saying that Zhi Gong's Twelve Times in the *Record of the Transmission of the Lamp* is a forgery and explaining why Zhi Gong was forged. I also consulted Mr. Hu Shih, who also thought it was not genuine and cited some evidence of later origin.</p>
<p>The *Book of Sui*, Volume 15, "Treatise on Music," says:</p>
<p>"Emperor Yang did not understand music and did not care about it. Later, he made a large number of flamboyant pieces with extremely licentious lyrics. He ordered the music director Bai Mingda to create new sounds: the *Ten Thousand Years of Joy*, the *Hidden Hook Joy*, the *Meeting on the Seventh Evening Joy* (omitted) and the *Twelve Times*, etc. Suppressed and concealed, the mournful sounds were cut off, and the Emperor was endlessly pleased."</p>
<p>Bai Mingda was from Kucha. The *Book of Sui* lists these new sounds in the Kucha music section. Looking at these song titles, we can imagine that these songs were all based on existing song lyrics, and Bai Mingda was ordered to compose a new tune. The Japanese scholar Hayashi Ichizo wrote an article titled "Research on the Tunes of Sui and Tang Yanyue Music," and his conclusion was that "the various tunes of popular music can be said to be Hu music tunes wearing Chinese clothes" (Guo Moruo's translation, page 120). I think that's right. Therefore, those flamboyant pieces were not only the Hu-ization of the tunes, but the lyrics were still those that existed in the time of Emperor Yang of Sui.</p>
<p>The tenth type of the Twelve Times of the Day that I have collated from Dunhuang is titled "General Exhortation for the Four Assemblies to Practice According to the Teachings," which is the longest piece. The entire piece is written in 3-3-7 sentences, with each time repeating nine times at the least and sixteen times at the most, totaling one hundred and thirty-five verses and about two thousand three hundred words, so I call it the "Great Twelve Times." Pelliot scroll 2714 says, "In the Zhonghe year, leap March, hungry people kill each other," which easily reminds us of Qin Fu Yin's "In the Zhonghe Guimao, spring in March," and should be works of the same era. Examining the records, Guimao is the third year of Zhonghe, without a leap March; only in the fifth year of Zhonghe (885) was there a leap March. This "Great Twelve Times" should have been written in the fifth year of Zhonghe or slightly later. Furthermore, Pelliot scroll 2054 is a manuscript written in the second year of Tongguang (924), but it does not have the verse "In the Zhonghe year." This is probably because it was no longer relevant to current events, so the performers deleted that verse. The fact that this "Great Twelve Times" was preserved in four manuscripts in the Dunhuang caves is due to the fact that in the temples of the late Tang and Five Dynasties period, it was often used as a lecture and chanting text. This can be seen from the last verse:</p>
<p>"Respectfully ask, the day will set,</p>
<p>Calculate all disciples should return.</p>
<p>Chanting Buddha, go home,</p>
<p>Tomorrow on time, do not be late."</p>
<p>Three of the four manuscripts of this "Great Twelve Times" do not list the author's surname. However, on the back of Pelliot scroll 2054, it is recorded as "Grand Master Zhiyan's Twelve Times, one scroll." Who should this Grand Master Zhiyan be?</p>
<p>If it is determined that this "Great Twelve Times" is a work from the fifth year of Zhonghe (885) or slightly later, this Grand Master Zhiyan should not be Grand Master Zhiyan of Niu Tou Mountain in Jinling (600-677), and even less likely to be the tenth disciple of Buddha Dashi, Grand Master Zhiyan, nor does it seem like Zhiyan of the Xiang Temple on Mount Zhongnan, who translated scriptures. We can only say that this Grand Master Zhiyan was a not-very-famous monk of the Zhonghe era of the Tang Dynasty. This statement is logically correct, but it may not be correct in fact. Because we have already identified the Zhi Gong Twelve Times in the Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp as a forgery, and the White Secretary's Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day that came out of Dunhuang, the White Secretary refers to Bai Juyi, and it is obvious that it is a forgery without needing to be identified. Both of those pieces were written by unknown authors and were attributed to the names of Zhi Gong and Bai Juyi after a long period of circulation. If we understand this point, it is correct to say that this "Great Twelve Times" is attributed to Zhiyan before Zhi Gong, and it is also correct to say that it is attributed to Grand Master Zhiyan of Niu Tou Mountain.</p>
<p>The fourth to eighth types of the Twelve Times are all called "Filial Piety Text." The eighth type, Pelliot scroll 3821, tells twelve historical stories, and I have a separate article discussing and researching them.</p>
<p>Chen Zhensun's *Annotations and Explications of Books from the Straight Studio*, Volume 12, "Immortals," has a *Master Xu's Twelve Times Song*, one scroll, explaining: "His name is unknown." Furthermore, Song Shi Xiaoying's *Luo Lake Field Records*, Volume 3, records Master Zhantang Zhun of Bao Feng's *Twelve Times Praise*. Their era should be slightly later than the ones that came out of Dunhuang. (Written on November 18, 1947, revised on March 26, 1948.)</p>
<h3 id="e130">Matters Concerning Lu Shanqing's Deeds: Mr. Xiang Zonglu's Posthumous Works <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese-circulated "Selections of Refined Literature with Collected Annotations," in one hundred and twenty volumes, had its fragmented scrolls printed by Luo Shuyan. Now, there is also a newly printed Japanese edition. It quotes extensively from Lu Shanqing's explanations. Yang Xingwu's copied ancient scroll in thirty volumes also records Lu Shanqing's explanations at the top margins of the first volume. However, both the "Old Book of Tang" and "New Book of Tang" do not include a biography of Shanqing, and his official career is unknown. Sen Ritsushi's "Record of Visiting Ancient Classics" states, "Regarding Lu Shanqing's annotation of the 'Selections of Refined Literature,' I have searched through historical records, but I cannot find it listed." This shows that he had long been interested in this matter.</p>
<p>Now, examining the Tang Kai Cheng Stone Classics, the memorial presented by Li Linfu, Scholar of the Jixian Academy and Chancellor, concerning the annotation of the "Monthly Ordinances" (Yue Ling), mentions that Lu Shanqing, Attendant Academician and Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary, co-authored the annotation. The "New Book of Tang, Record of Literature" contains one volume of the imperially revised "Record of Rites, Monthly Ordinances," and lists the annotations by scholars of the Jixian Academy, including Li Linfu, among whom are three Attendant Academicians, with Shanqing being one of them. The varying degrees of detail in their titles are because Shanqing's original official position was Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary, and he entered the Jixian Academy as an Attendant Academician due to his involvement in compiling books. Volume thirty of the "Tang Liudian" states, "The Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary is of the lower seventh rank." Volume nine states, "In the Jixian Academy Painting Institute, officials of the fifth rank and above are Academicians, and those of the sixth rank and below are Attendant Academicians." Shanqing's official rank was below the sixth rank, so he was an Attendant Academician. The historical records omit his original official position. The ancient Japanese manuscript of the "Meng Qiu" records that after Li Liang's memorial recommending the "Meng Qiu," there is an inscription that reads, "In the fifth year of Tianbao (the year is suspected to be 'zai'; the era name had already been changed to 'zai'), August 1st, Li Liang, Prefect of Raozhou, presented the memorial, ordering Lu Shanqing, Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy, to write the memorial." (See "Record of Visiting Books in Japan." Li Qi respectfully notes: The Paris-preserved Dunhuang fragmented scroll of Li's "Meng Qiu," P.2710, Li Liang's presented memorial, has the inscription "Liang ordered Lu Shanqing, Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy, to create the memorial. The memorial was not acted upon because Liang was replaced, and the matter was shelved.") Volume twenty-one of the "Tang Liudian" states, "The Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy is of the lower fourth rank." Shanqing was formerly Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary, entered the Jixian Academy as an Attendant Academician, and by the fifth year of Tianbao, had been promoted to Director of Studies. Therefore, his tenure as Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary and as Attendant Academician of the Jixian Academy was before the fifth year of Tianbao.</p>
<p>The "New Book of Tang, Record of Literature, Philosophical Works" contains Lu Shanqing's seven-volume annotation of "Mencius," also found in the "Chongwen General Catalogue," which states, "Lu Shanqing deleted Zhao's annotation." Sun Yigong's "Sounds and Meanings of Mencius" frequently quotes his explanations, and the preface states, "Those who annotated it include Zhao Qi and Lu Shanqing." It also states, "Since Lu Shanqing, although their interpretations may have minor differences, they all adhere to Zhao's school." In the false "Mencius" with Sun's commentary, under the title, it also states, "As for the 'Chongwen General Catalogue' of the Imperial Dynasty, 'Mencius' only preserves Zhao Qi's fourteen-volume annotation and Lu Shanqing's seven-volume annotation." In recent times, Ma Zhuwu compiled scattered fragments of Shanqing's annotation of "Mencius," and then said, "Shanqing's identity is unknown," which is careless.</p>
<p>Shanqing also authored the "New Character Forest" (Xin Zi Lin), which is frequently cited in the "Guangyun" (Expanded Rhyme Dictionary). In modern times, Huang Youyuan of the Hanxue Hall compiled an edition. Ren Youzhi's "Textual Research on the Character Forest" is also appended to the end of each section. The end of the book contains a note by Ding Xiaoshan stating, "In the 'Guangyun,' under the tenth Yu rhyme, it is cited as Lu Gai. The annotation under the 'Chu' character in Huang's compiled edition of the 'Character Forest' states: 'It is suspected that Gai is the given name, and Shanqing is the courtesy name.'" It is the case that people of the Tang Dynasty often used their courtesy name. Shanqing's given name was Gai, but the memorial still refers to him as Shanqing, perhaps as a comparison?</p>
<p>His annotations of other books are listed in the "Catalogue of Books Seen" by the Japanese Fujiwara Sukeyo: "Book of Changes" in eight volumes, "Ancient Script of Documents" in ten volumes, "Book of Zhou" in sixteen volumes (in the poetry section, suspected to be a mistake for "Mao's Book of Poetry"), "Three Rites" in thirty volumes, "Three Commentaries" in thirty volumes, "Sayings on Poetry" in six volumes, and "Liezi" in eight volumes. (Also listed is "Mencius" in seven volumes.) His writings also include "Continuation of the Liang Dynasty's Record of Common Surnames and Given Names" (recorded in the "Siku General Catalogue, Class of Encyclopedic Works," with a "Hanhai" edition containing this book), which can be considered abundant.</p>
<p>Shanqing's annotation of the "Selections of Refined Literature" is mentioned in the "Jade Sea" (Yu Hai), volume fifty-four, quoting the "Notes of the Jixian Academy," which states, "In the third month of the nineteenth year of Kaiyuan, Xiao Song memorialized that Wang Zhiming, Li Yuancheng, and Chen Ju should annotate the 'Selections of Refined Literature.' Previously, Feng Guangzhen received an imperial order to enter the academy to proofread the 'Selections of Refined Literature.' He memorialized that Li Shan's old annotations were not precise and requested a revision, which was approved. Guangzhen himself wrote several volumes of annotations. Song, considering the old work of previous generations, wished to continue their efforts and instructed Zhiming and others to compile them. In the fifth month of the following year, he ordered Zhiming, Yuancheng, and Lu Shanqing to focus on annotating the 'Selections of Refined Literature,' but the matter was not completed." Xiao Song was dismissed from the chancellorship in the twenty-first year of Kaiyuan. Li Linfu first became chancellor in the twenty-second year of Kaiyuan. Volume twenty-one of the "Comprehensive Institutions" (Tongdian) states, "The Jixian Academy Writing Institute always had a chancellor as a scholar to oversee the academy's affairs." The "Tang Zhi" agrees. Xiao Song oversaw the matter of proofreading the "Selections of Refined Literature" because he was the chancellor in charge of the academy at the time. Li Linfu oversaw the matter of annotating the "Monthly Ordinances" because he was the chancellor in charge of the academy at the time. From this, it can be inferred that Shanqing received the order to annotate the "Selections of Refined Literature" before Xiao Song's dismissal from the chancellorship in the twenty-first year of Kaiyuan. His participation in annotating the "Monthly Ordinances" must have been after Linfu became chancellor in the twenty-second year of Kaiyuan. In the fifth year of Tianbao, he was the Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy, so his tenure as Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary and as Attendant Academician of the Jixian Academy was before the fifth year of Tianbao. The "Notes of the Jixian Academy" state that "the matter was not completed," but the collected annotations extensively quote his explanations, which means that Lu did have a completed book. Could it be that Shanqing initially received the order to co-annotate with Wang and Li, but the matter was suspended, and Shanqing became determined to complete it on his own?</p>
<h3 id="e131">Ceremonial Music and Military Marches <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shiqing</p>
<p>Ceremonial music and military marches are one and the same, but historical records are quite confusing. To make things easier to understand, I would like to roughly analyze them.</p>
<p>(1) The annotation to the "Rites and Ceremonies" section of the "Book of Later Han" quotes Cai Yong's "Treatise on Music": "There are four types of Han music: first, the Great Yu Music, which is used for sacrifices at the suburban altars, banquets in the imperial halls, and feasts. ... Second, the Zhou Hymns and Elegant Music, which are used for ceremonies at the Imperial Academy, archery competitions, and sacrifices to the Six Venerables and the Gods of Soil and Grain. ... Third, the Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music, which the emperor uses to entertain his ministers. The poetry says, 'The drums resound, and we dance.' The short flute and military marches are military music. It is said that it was created by the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo to establish majesty, promote virtue, and encourage the soldiers." The Han music system is fully illustrated here, but only the twenty-two tunes of short flute and military marches, such as "Zhu Lu" (The Egret), have been passed down to later generations. The "Treatise on Music" in the "Book of Jin" states: "During the Han Dynasty, there was the music of short flute and military marches, and its tunes included 'Zhu Lu,' 'Thinking of the Sorrowful Old Man,' 'Ai Ru Zhang,' 'Return to the Emperor,' 'Yong Li,' 'Battle South of the City,' 'Mount Wu is High,' 'General's Advance,' 'The Emperor's Horse is Yellow,' 'Ascending the Mausoleum,' 'Something to Think About,' 'Pheasant Class,' 'The Sage Emerges,' 'Fragrant Tree,' 'Wickedness Above,' 'Approaching the High Terrace,' 'As Far as Expected,' 'Stone Remains,' 'Wu Cheng,' 'Black Cloud,' 'Yellow Sparrow's Flight,' 'Fishing Rod,' etc., which are listed under Ceremonial Music, mostly describing battle scenes." The Wei, Wu, and Jin dynasties also successively made adjustments, and the titles of the tunes were changed, but the general term "Short Flute and Military Marches" was still used. According to Cai's text, Ceremonial Music is for banquets, while Military Marches are for the military; and the "Book of Jin" also states that it "mostly describes battle scenes," which is more consistent with Cai's text. Therefore, Ceremonial Music and Military Marches have clear distinctions in application and were undoubtedly two different types of Han music from the beginning. As a result, later references to Cai's text often place numbers above "Short Flute and Military Marches" to distinguish it from the first three types. (See the "Book of Song" and the "Comprehensive Examination of Documents," etc.)</p>
<p>(2) However, the tone of Cai's text still seems ambiguous. If the word "four types" were not clearly stated in the front, it would be quite natural and reasonable to regard Military Marches as a type of Ceremonial Music. Moreover, the earliest appearance of Short Flute and Military Marches is in the "Book of Jin." During the great chaos in Tokyo, various types of music were scattered and lost. These were probably collected after the Han Dynasty. Therefore, the number of tunes collected varies greatly in later generations. The "Book of Jin" records twenty-two tunes, the "Book of Song" records eighteen tunes, while Liu Zongyuan of the Tang Dynasty and others in the Song and Yuan dynasties have verified twelve tunes. Not only that, but not all of the tunes are military music. For example, "Return to the Emperor" describes imperial tours, "Ascending the Mausoleum" describes sacrifices, and "Zhu Lu" describes auspicious omens. It can be seen that the content of Military Marches is actually very broad. As for "Wu Cheng," "Yellow Sparrow," "Black Cloud," and "As Far As Expected," according to the "Jianchu Records," they are mostly cavalry music and now also belong to Military Marches. Therefore, the productions of the Wei and Jin dynasties deviated from the original meaning and tended to focus on describing meritorious deeds. This is a major shift in Military Marches. By the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the name "Short Flute and Military Marches" was directly changed to "Ceremonial Music Tunes." The "Book of Song" states: "Han Ceremonial Music tunes are called Military Marches." The "Comprehensive Institutions" states: "Ceremonial music is short flute and military marches." The "Comprehensive Records" clearly notes: "In the Han and Jin dynasties, it was called Short Flute and Military Marches; in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, it was called Ceremonial Music Tunes." Do these not clearly tell us that Ceremonial Music and Military Marches are precisely united as one?</p>
<p>However, there should still be a distinction, and that lies in their subordinate relationship. Regarding the Way, there are two different views:</p>
<p>(3) Cui Bao's "Annotations on Current Affairs" states: "Han music has Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music, which the emperor uses to entertain his ministers. Short Flute Military Marches is one part of Ceremonial Music and is also bestowed upon meritorious lords. Therefore, Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music, Short Flute Military Marches, and Cavalry Music are collectively called Ceremonial Music, but their uses are different." The "Comprehensive Institutions" states: "Han Ceremonial Music tunes include Military Marches." Yang Shen's "Critiques of Lyrics" states: "Ceremonial Music is the general name for all music. Its application is also different. That which is used for court assemblies and banquets is called Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music; that which is used for processions is called Cavalry Music; that which is played on horseback during military campaigns is called Cavalry Music; and that which is played at ancestral temples during the return of the army is called Short Flute Military Marches." They probably considered Cai's tone and adopted a broad view of Ceremonial Music. In reality, precisely because they restored Military Marches to its original meaning on the one hand and expanded Ceremonial Music to the general term for all music on the other hand, they had to subordinate Military Marches to Ceremonial Music. According to this view, Military Marches would be called Ceremonial Music Military Marches Tunes. (The "Collection of Music Bureau Poetry" marks some Ceremonial Music tunes with this name.)</p>
<p>(4) If one looks at the actual content of Military Marches, one can say that Military Marches is actually the sum of all music. Jia Duanlin once said: "The Short Flute Military Marches since the Wei and Jin dynasties are the ancient Elegance and Hymns." Indeed, the music of imperial banquets was called Elegance in ancient times, and the music of sacrifices was called Hymns in ancient times; doesn't Military Marches include Ceremonial Music? This view was formally put forward by Jiang Kui of the Southern Song Dynasty. According to the "Preface to the Ceremonial Music and Ceremonial Music Tunes" in Baishi Daoren's "Songs": "Ceremonial music is Han music. That which is played in front of the palace is called Ceremonial Music, and that which is played in the military is called Cavalry Music." Here, Ceremonial Music and Cavalry Music are listed together and each is a part of Ceremonial Music, which is exactly the opposite of Cui Bao's opinion. He adopted Liu Zongyuan's naming and called it Ceremonial Music Ceremonial Music Tunes, which, when viewed in comparison, is quite interesting.</p>
<p>In short, Ceremonial Music and Military Marches were originally two different musical chapters when the Han Dynasty created music, but as a result of later evolution, they have become one and two, and two and one.</p>

<h3 id="e134">The Plan for the Day Lies in the Night <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Recently, I gave my students the topic of "Night Reading," and one student actually wrote: "The saying 'The plan for the day lies in the morning' doesn't seem very reasonable to me, because I'm not used to reading in the morning, and it's too hot at noon. Of course, night is the most suitable time. The sounds in the morning are really too noisy: 'Huang Ma, bring me a bottle of boiled water!' 'Help me dry a few bowls of porridge!' 'Help me comb my hair, comb two small braids!' 'Help me...' Do you think I can still read? In the afternoon, I have to do trigonometric functions in English... It's simply impossible to read." This student will definitely be a comrade of Mr. Lin Yutang. I have already written "I look forward to it, I will wait and see."</p>
<p>In fact, upon further thought, what plans do we make in the morning? Although the word "plan" can also be interpreted as "having a smooth beginning will surely lead to a complete future," the morning in the city is completely a world of carrying dung buckets and selling green vegetables. Even the big shots and tycoons who go to office buildings and writing rooms won't lazily get up until after nine o'clock, except for those workers who claim to be of the proletariat. Conversely, if you go to dance halls, bars, hotels, theaters, and cinemas after 7 p.m. every night, wouldn't that really represent the facade of urban life? This doesn't even include the core. The core is in the "branch factories" of the tycoons, the "secret lairs" of the bosses, or the "small residences" of the celebrities. In these places, after the night is deep and quiet, the abacus and the brain move together, and human flesh and gold banknotes are eaten together. This is the center of power that dominates the city, the main force that threatens everyone's spiritual and material feelings.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ancients advocated having a clear conscience in the darkness and not deceiving oneself in a dark room.</p>
<p>However, all maxims and slogans represent a kind of shortcoming and failure. Everyone will boast on the surface, but no one doesn't play tricks behind the scenes. I think Guanxi Master Yang Zhen's doctrine of "four knows" must be a fable. If there really is such a person right now, I guarantee that he is 100% an idiot, and few people would not laugh at him! Because at this time and in this place, the measure of a person's character is the measure of their money and property. As long as you have money, no one dares to ask how it was acquired.</p>
<p>Mencius had an even more wonderful saying, saying something about preserving the night qi, preserving the morning qi. Morning is still debatable, but what is the use of this night qi besides making us shiver? Although night qi has a slight sense of coolness, it only makes the brains of those cannibals sharper and more meticulous. It will never make them have the slightest bit of reflection, I can say for sure. Perhaps because of this, there is the saying "If you have never done anything wrong in your life, you won't be startled by a knock on the door in the middle of the night." In reality, because people always do wrong, and they do it especially at night—"Set fires when the wind is high, and kill people when the moon is dark"—so that is why ghosts are born at night. It's as if when night falls, the universe is no longer ruled by humans, but by a monster that specializes in opposing humans. I don't know if these kinds of ghosts are in desolate mountains and wild graves, or in the shady corners of battlefields, but they definitely live in people's hearts. Or even further, the person who is afraid of ghosts is himself the fiercest and most evil ghost.</p>
<p>In this case, it is undeniable that night is the world of ghosts. We can view the gentlemen and adults, the officials in ceremonial attire, in this way. They are all withered like dead people during the day, but at night they are happy like madmen. Luo Liangfeng's "Pictures of Ghosts for Fun" probably includes this kind of treasure. When we read "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," we see so many romantic stories of the night that it makes us want to be neighbors with ghosts and foxes. No wonder the "mulberry student" on "Lotus Fragrance" proudly said: "If a male ghost comes, I have a sharp sword; if a female ghost comes, I will open the door and welcome her." The ghosts in these stories are much more interesting than people. These ghosts may not need to specialize in "night tours" and might as well have a competition with living people in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Burning oil to continue studying is originally an encouragement to people to work hard. In fact, this doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be a bookworm and really devote yourself to it. It probably also includes the meaning of enjoying yourself in time. This is why Li Bai's "Spring Night Banquet at the Peach and Plum Garden" has become a masterpiece for thousands of years. Moreover, what is the ultimate goal of studying for people today, just like the ancients? Only with today's "using the night to continue the day" can there be tomorrow's "using the night to paint." Haven't you seen those vigorous individuals who were once like clouds in their youth, but now they have all become the main characters who open rooms in big hotels for overnight stays?</p>
<p>Night, night, night, the night with "promising signs," the golden night! I will sing and praise it without reservation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Yu Dafu's Poems <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Maoren</p>
<p>The "Free Talk" section often publishes old-style poems, and every time after reading them, I inexplicably recall Mr. Yu Dafu's old-style poems. Mr. Yu wrote quite a few old-style poems, but I only have one of his handwritten "Miscellaneous Affairs in Qingdao" poems, which was given to me by a friend:</p>
<p>A clear island in ten thousand tons of waves, precisely because of the righteousness of the dead soldiers,</p>
<p>Now Liu Yu calls himself Emperor of Qi, singing of peace to cover up the despoiling of their homes.</p>
<p>I also remember another poem of his:</p>
<p>The disturbances in the Central Plains have not yet ceased, and safety and danger are linked to the small island of Yingzhou.</p>
<p>The women have not changed their Tang attire, and the elders still think of the Han crown and robes.</p>
<p>Suddenly it is reported that the red flag is hung on the Qin Pass, and I alone worry that a great calamity is coming to the clear stream.</p>
<p>The son of Jing Sheng will end up as a pig or dog, and Emperor Yu also had the surname Liu that year.</p>
<p>There is no lack of people in the world who love Yu's poems. Recently, I read Wu Dianjun's article "Zheng Ziyu Compiles and Prints Dafu's Collection of Poems and Lyrics" in the "Xin Bao" of the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic], May 27th, which briefly states that Zheng Ziyu, a young poet from Xiamen, and Yu Dafu, who came to Xiamen from Taiwan, discussed in a cafe the possibility of compiling a collection of old-style poems by modern Chinese writers. Later, due to the difficulty in collecting materials, only a collection of Dafu's poems and lyrics was compiled. Yu Dafu originally introduced Zheng to Professor Kanda, a Chinese literature expert at the Japanese Imperial University, but Zheng considered the sales problem and planned to publish it domestically. He is currently writing letters to an editor at a certain bookstore in Shanghai and a certain professor at a certain university in Peiping to discuss this. On June 16th, the "Xin Bao" again had an article by Zheng Ziyu, discussing Yu's old-style poems, but not mentioning whether the publication of the Dafu's collection of poems and lyrics he edited had been finalized.</p>
<p>There is an extremely interesting point in Zheng's article, saying: "Since he (Yu) came to Fujian last year to become an official, the Shanghai tabloids have all scolded him for 'losing his integrity.'" It is impossible to investigate which tabloid is mentioned here, but if what he said is true, it can be known that some people have already regarded Yu Dafu's position as a councilor within the territory of his own country as "losing his integrity." Even more interesting is that Zheng, who compiled Yu's poems and lyrics, seems to be very afraid that Yu will truly "lose his integrity," saying that Yu's poem "Following the Rhyme of the Inscription on the Fishing Terrace" is a work of "repeatedly defending" his loss of integrity, and citing the line "The ashes in the pit have not yet cooled, waiting to raise dust," saying: "If this sentence is true, then Mr. Yu Dafu still has hope!" Now that Yu has died in a foreign land and no longer "loses his integrity" to become an official, he will probably not disappoint Zheng's expectations! The original poem, according to Zheng's recording, is:</p>
<p>At the end of the year, I am extremely poor, and a certain government official took pity on my poverty and asked me to write an article, so I followed the rhyme of the inscription on the Fishing Terrace to answer:</p>
<p>After ten thousand calamities, I am frail and ill, and although my name is still there, it is no longer real.</p>
<p>I am ashamed that Bao Shu can take pity on me, and I am only afraid that Guan Fu will scold me.</p>
<p>The mud horse is proud but ultimately lacks bones, the ashes in the pit have not yet died, waiting to raise dust.</p>
<p>The "Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals" should be passed down in the country, why must Chen Xiong play Qin again?</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Crane of Huang Garden <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Recently, this publication carried Half-Dream Old Man's "Poetic Record of Crane Dance," with splendid writing. Reciting it, I cannot stop for a long time. The old man said that he and Qian Meng visited Huang Garden together to observe the crane dance. Now I don't know if the crane is still there, etc. Is Qian Meng the same as Mr. Shi Qing? If so, he is indeed a friend of my youth. Huang Garden is a place I often visit. Every time I have a day off, I go to see the flowers and taste tea, and have a half-day of pleasant conversation with the garden owner, Yue Yuan. I use it to wash away the dust of the world. The crane has a head full of spiritual sand, and its feathers are as white as snow. When it sees guests, it often dances gracefully, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes bending over, sometimes looking up, sometimes like smoke rising, sometimes like clouds floating, and it claps its wings to make a sound, occasionally interspersing with clear cries. The old man feeds it things like perch and loach every day, in a very large quantity, spending more than two catties a day, and the monthly cost is considerable. It is said that this crane was originally a domestic bird of the Xu Garden in northern Shanghai. Later, it was captured by the Hermit of White Dragon Mountain. The Hermit lived in Zhizhi Garden in the southern city and kept two cranes, male and female, to use as models for painting "Pine and Crane" pictures. Unexpectedly, in a certain cold winter, the female crane suddenly fell ill and died. The male crane lost its partner, and its diet decreased sharply, no less than Feng Qian's grief. The hermit couldn't bear to see its decline, so he gave the male crane to the Poor People's Vocational Training Center to raise. However, the Vocational Training Center sought production. Now raising a crane not only did not contribute to production, but also had a large expense of crane feed, which was difficult to maintain. Yue Yuan knew this and asked about the price. The person in charge said that public property could not be sold. If you truly love it, please donate ten dan of rice to exchange for it. At that time, rice was ten yuan per dan, costing a total of one hundred gold. Yue Yuan instructed a gardener to carry it back in a cage. The cage was carried on a rickshaw. The crane spread its wings out of the cage, and as the rickshaw wheels turned, its wings were injured. The gardener was rude and did not know it, so to this day, one wing is still drooping and has not healed, which is a regrettable matter. The poem about the fishing terrace is:</p>
<p>It's not that I cherish my body before the wine, pretending to be crazy inevitably becomes real.</p>
<p>Once I whipped a famous horse while drunk, I fear that too much affection will burden beautiful women.</p>
<p>The disasters in the southeast are the sins of heaven, the cocks crow, the wind and rain stir up dust in the sea.</p>
<p>What is the use of singing evil songs and crying in pain? Righteous men all talk about Emperor Qin.</p>
<p>Yu's old-style poems are really very good. I simply transcribe another poem recorded by Zheng:</p>
<p>I recklessly threw gold to buy A Jiao, when poor, I blew the xiao again in Wu Market.</p>
<p>The sound of the xiao travels far across the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, blowing to the Twenty-Four Bridges in Yangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e137">A Stone in the Garbage Heap <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Ruzi</p>
<p>One day, the great Italian artist Michelangelo was strolling on the streets of Florence when he saw a piece of famous Carrara marble from the Carrara quarry in a garbage heap beside the street. It was discarded and unused by some sculptor or worker because it was damaged. Michelangelo became interested in this white marble, walked over and carefully examined it. After thinking for a while, he felt that although the stone had been damaged, it was a pity to discard it, so he ordered the workers to move the stone back. Not long after, Michelangelo's masterpiece "David" that caused a sensation in the art world was born. It turned out that it was carved from this stone in the garbage heap.</p>
<p>"A good craftsman does not waste material," as can be seen from this. What is eaten is grass, what is squeezed out is milk, this is the greatness of the artist. Material conditions are the same, but the height of art can be seen from the method and technique.</p>

<p>British wireless radio manufacturing has seen rapid progress recently. In the city of Walden on the River Thames, there is a wireless radio factory that can now produce everything mechanically, requiring absolutely no human labor. The factory has a 70-foot-long tubular machine, managed by electronics. One end of this "tube" "swallows" the various components "sent" from another machine, and then rows of neatly assembled wireless radios are constantly "spit out" from the other end of this "tube"—it only takes twenty seconds to produce a high-quality radio. (As you wish)</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>During the 16th century, the struggle between the old and new religions in Europe was fierce, involving politics and international affairs, resulting in extremely cruel killings and unrest. All of France was in turmoil, with no peaceful days throughout the year and no tranquil land. England was also repeatedly caught in the whirlpool. Queen Elizabeth I, however, uniquely pacified the country with calmness and peace, and guarded it with a firm defense, blocking external disturbances, thereby enabling the nation to recuperate, revitalize all industries, and develop both industry and commerce, creating a large middle class (Wealthy middle class) and laying the foundation for the country. As a result, she expanded maritime transport, with countless navigators advancing to all parts of the globe, encroaching on Spain's maritime rights and territories, and replacing them. With internal and external affairs supporting each other, the country became stronger and wealthier. Although small farmers suffered from annexation, they were ultimately protected by law, preventing major harm. At the same time, literature and art flourished. Shakespeare, Bacon, and Spencer's plays, literature, philosophy, and science all emerged during this period. Therefore, during her reign, in every aspect, talents and opportunities converged, collectively unleashing brilliant flowers. As for her personal unparalleled beauty and superior status, which are worthy of envy, they are merely secondary matters. How can the current Queen Elizabeth compare to even a fraction of her? Only recently, news from London has indicated that the British monarch will tour Australia, a long and distant journey, requiring the princess to act as regent, and only this point slightly resembles the former. The traditional British model dictates that both the prince and princess have "Heir" qualifications, and there is no shortage of examples.</p>
<p>England is the only monarchy among the major powers today, and its monarch, apart from the crown and ceremonial vanity, actually possesses the demeanor of an ordinary person in all rights and obligations. It is often said that the true meaning of "democracy" lies in the monarchy of England, which is indeed no exaggeration. This is why its monarchical system has endured and does not hinder the spirit of democracy, which is fundamentally different from the divine belief held by the Japanese Emperor. Among its historically famous monarchs, Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria (who also became Empress of India) each have their own merits. Compared to the Chinese historical figures renowned as the reigns of Cheng and Kang of Zhou, Wen and Jing of Han, and Kang and Qian of Qing, they are unsurpassed. Moreover, they were all women, and their glory for the country surpassed that of other male monarchs, which can be called a miracle. Chinese historical princesses had no possibility of participating in the imperial succession, because the patriarchal system was vastly different from the West. The so-called "daughters born outward," although being imperial blood, ultimately belonged to other surnames. Therefore, if problems arose with the emperor (either due to youth or other reasons preventing them from exercising political power), the empress dowager would come forward to seize power. Whether it was Empress Lü Zhi of Han, Empress Wu Zetian of Tang, or Empress Dowager Cixi of Qing, regardless of their notorious deeds that are difficult to compare with the illustrious merits of the British female rulers, their origins were also fundamentally different. They all became Queen because they "had a husband who was a monarch," not because they inherited the throne as a normal Queen. Therefore, their political power was seized during times of young rulers and national doubt. Cixi repeatedly established young emperors in order to "rule from behind the curtain," ultimately leading the Qing Dynasty to decline.</p>
<p>The puppet Manchu emperor Puyi, also known as Emperor Xuantong of the former Qing Dynasty, remained in the Forbidden City for more than ten years after abdicating in the Xinhai Revolution. He hired the English professor Reginald Johnston to teach him English and study Western learning, gradually becoming influenced by European customs. He adopted an English name, Henry, and the Lady Rong he married also possessed the style of a female student, and her English name was Elizabeth. Before the incident, the Shanghai-published "Yi Jing" magazine once featured their English-signed short notes, which were quite humorous. Although they admired the great names of Henry and Elizabeth of England, they seemed not to understand their deeds.</p>
