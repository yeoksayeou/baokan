<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕新行政院長人選問題，各方積極重視，首都廿一日之政治活動，顯亦以此爲中心，然迄深夜十二時止，院長人選尙未能作最後決定，就廿一日趨勢觀之，何應欽出任行憲政院首任院長之可能性頗大，惟何氏本人仍表堅辭，各方正敦勸中。張羣廿一日午離京飛渝，即係表示無意出任新行政院長之決心，然此尙不能謂張氏無被提名之可能，惟廿一日晨國民黨立委假投票之結果，證實何應欽已獲較多數立委之支持。何氏寓邸廿一日竟日冠蓋雲集，若干立委亦紛往訪晤，敦勸何氏出組新閣，惟廿一日下午何氏仍遵醫囑往遊中山陵，迄晚始返，記渚於廿一日夜十一時往訪，何氏仍表禾未考慮及此，其意志似甚堅決。等待總統提出政院長人選，俾討論是否能予同意之立法院，廿一日竟日休會，廿二日上午亦未規定會期，如總統任命政院長之咨文能於廿二日午前提出，立院即準備於廿二日下午舉行全院委員會議，俾能迅速通過。據悉：張羣在渝將勾留一週左右，俟新政院長人選提出通渦後，仍將返京辦理政院交代事宜。</p>

<h3 id="c24">反對屈拉普的不賠償論 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>美國陸長西雅爾於五月十九日發表陸次屈拉普視察日韓的報告；內客要點如次：其一建臘將日本賠款减至一億六千五百萬美元；其二：要求對日本立即予以大規模之經濟援助，使日本生產活潑，貿易發展；特別强調中日貿易。此項報告書發表之後，除了日本各界一致表示熱烈歡迎外，遠東有關各國均加以攻擊，我駐日賠償組長吳半晨，於廿日發表談話，嚴斥其內容的荒謬。據新亞社東京消息：美國務院可能不採取該項報告書之意見。但無論美國務院的態度如何？「屈拉普報告書」的明目張膽扶植日本，却爲一種事實；且爲美國扶植日本一聯串的事實中最惹人注意的一串，我們中國對此，自不能緘默。</p>
<p>先說屈拉普報告書的由來。戰後美國的對日政策，是由陸軍部和國務院分別決定的。年來陸軍部比較佔上風，取得相當的決定力。有一個時期，陸軍部與國務院的對日政策，略有差異，本年二月廿六日國務院忽宣佈派遣政策委員會凱南飛往東京，調查日本情勢。凱南調查返國後，對日的觀感如何，報紙隻字未提；接着陸軍部便派陸次屈拉普帶了顧問團，飛往日本若干企業家在內，於三月廿日抵東京，廿八日去漢城，四月二日離日返美。屈拉普在日本活動，其聲勢之浩大，議論之驚人變成「亞洲的工廠」的計劃，致蘆田均一千人物，歡喜如狂，，現任調查團秘書）起草報告書，約輪司敦係「海外踏詢訽協會」的一系人物，他同史特萊克的觀點一樣：美國必須扶植日本，减少日本賠償，發展日本工集與實易。我們雖未問及屈拉普報告書全文，但察其人，觀其言，可以判斷這個報告書，不過是史特萊克報告賽的延長和擴大罷了。</p>
<p>屈拉普報告書係由陸長羅雅爾公佈的，論事權，陸軍部是沒有公佈此項文件的職權。羅雅爾既斷然予以公佈，使世界週知，此項報告書的精神，完全代表美國政府的，至少是代表美國陸軍部的意向。至於此項報告賽的要義，第一是减少日本賠償至一億六千五百萬美元，並主張「日本在國外之資產，如東北，台灣及其他地區中資產已入蘇聯及中國之手中，則應正式眾認及勾銷之。」以言日本兵工廠內之機器與工業設備，在有限制的情况下，移作賠償之用。第二，報告書主張大規模的經濟援助日本，因爲日本現感原料缺乏，食糧缺乏，如日本工業水準能提高，（報告書指出現在日本工業水準，不及一九三〇—三四年平均額之百分之四十五）各國均與之貿易，一最後不僅與日本有利，且與美國及其他國家有利。日本解除武裝後經濟生活的更生，有裨於增進太平洋及其他各地保持和平的機會。」第三，報告書力主中日恢復貿易，他說；「中日兩國倘能恢復積極貿易，則美國對該兩國的財政援助可極有效的運用。中國可出售多種原料嘉惠日本，日本亦有多種商品與設備爲中國所需」。第四，報告書說明援助南韓的重要，及日韓的一體。無疑的，屈拉普報告書的範圍比「史特萊克職告書」還要深入，還要廣泛。它充滿了强烈的政治意味。</p>
<p>再說我們對屈拉普報告書的觀感。從本項報告書的要點看來，美國扶植日本的政策，顯然有了劇烈的轉變，如果國務院也採取完全同一的步驟，則聯合國對日作戰的努力與失戰後遠東委員會決議的精神，將要完全付諸東流了，遠東各國所要求的賠償，如依據此項報告書執行，即將立刻變成鳥有；日本祗要付出一億六千五百萬美元的現金，或以東北台灣的「資產」作抵償，即可安然無事；這比史特萊克的反賠償論，可進一步。此不僅與波茨坦宣言的「實物賠償」精神不符，並且將一歸還物資」移充賠償，指鹿爲馬，完全消失了賠償的政治意義。我們不贊成史特萊克（的反賠償論；拒絕「屈拉普報告書」的不賠償論。我們認爲：在和約未締結前，片面扶植日本，是很不妥當的事。遠東有關各國對美國單獨管制日本的政策，月下正感覺焦慮，今後美國政府對日政策，如果以「屈拉普報告書」作中心，遠東各國即將由焦慮變成恐懼了。現在遠東各國對於此項報告書，所以一致予以攻擊，就是基於這種戒懼的心理</p>
<p>總之，「屈拉普報告書」所建議的賠償，工業水準，貿易話問題，多是不合理的意見，它比史特萊克報告書的建議，更不合理。故日來外界也有美國務院將拒絕接受此項報告書之說，我們相信美國政治家外交家，大半明智果敢，對於這種荒謬的意見決不會輕易採納的。我們爲中國本身的安全着想，伺時也爲美國在遠東的地位打算，仍盼望美國務院深加攷慮！</p>

<p>〔中央社東京廿一日電〕日首相蘆田均本日告中央社記者稱：蔣總統就任演辭中，所揭示之中國對日政策，重申中國對日決不採取報復主義之崇高意見，日本人民，極爲感激。產田稱：蔣總統之聲明，顯露中日兩國共同合作之希望。渠指出日本企求恢復正常貿易關係，日本刻正派遺商務代表團赴法·印·美及南美諸國，若在中國有歡迎此類代表團之任何表示，將願派遺一類似之商務代表團赴華。蘆田並謂：若中國政府當請日本文化界及科學界人十赴華訪問，並與中國之科學家及文化界領袖合作，則日本將立可派遣代表團。蘆田稱：蔣主席在戰事結束時之聲明，曾在日本全體人民間造成一種深刻印象，但最近中國報紙相反之言論，迄已引起日本國內之不安。蔣總統此時重申此項政策，正值日本人民對於此項政策最表惑激之時。記者詢以日本是否預期中國進口貨物，在最近所宣佈之五年經濟復興計劃中，佔據重要地位。蘆田答稱：即使無五年計劃，日本亦將歡迎中國之鐵砂·焦煤·工業用壟，及其他原料。渠並稱：同時中國或亦願輸入日本之某若干種工業成品。</p>
<p>〔路透社東京廿一日電〕日首相蘆田告眾院外交委員會稱：日本政府已在從事準備以便於和約簽訂後，即得重樹外交關係及自田貿易，目前雖尙不知和約將於何時締結，但日本必須有所準備以便隨時恢復外交關係及自由貿易。然在外國設立領事館以保護日人利益一事，則在相當時期內諒不致實現。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕遠東委員會今日開始討論日本戰後工業水池問題，以便訓令麥帥執行。據負責方面所知，訓令草案與委員會數月前臨時訓令實際相同，即指定工廠約一千家作爲賠償。惟臨時訓令並未執行，僅搬移少數毋機而已。新訓令與一年前美國之種種建議，亦實際相同。新訓令在委員會各小組討論已歷一年之久，但直至今日始交到全體會議討論。各代表稱，曾於數月前請示本國政府，一部份代表尙待答復，問新訓令規定之日本工業水準，低於美國歷次獨查團考察日本後所建議者。大抵美國頃向於贊成較高水準，使日本保留更多毋關，以供工業復與。其也太平洋盟國則贊成低水準，確保日本不能在軍事上復活並延擱日本之商業復興，以免日本經濟復興危及各國本身工業發展。</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京廿一日電〕此間各報就我國新總統就職演說中之對日政策，雖均將原文披露，但均未作批評。惟有數報同時刊載一合眾社華雄頓電訊稱，中國將在對日和約中要求下列數項：（一）廢除天皇制度；（二）組織國際警察監督對日和約之實行；（三）中國應得日本賠償總額之半數；（四）取締日本重建金屬工業化學工業等；（五）日本領土應限於本州·四國·九州反北海道；（六）琉球歸返中國；（七）限制可供軍事工業之原料輸日。該電訊末段則稱，此類要求在恢復日工業及國際貿易之觀點上，已爲美國及歐西各國所反對。惟美佔領當局在對日和約尙未締行以前，各種對日和約上之意見均將予以攷慮。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦二十電〕倫敦外交界人士相信，英國之不欲在安理會中支持美國之決議案，以宣在巴勒斯坦局勢已構成破壞和平的狀態，係爲不願對阿拉伯國停止供給軍事援助之故，而此等軍事援助之供給，固爲英國對埃及·伊拉克，外約但諸國之條約義務。英外交部於兩日前即巳聲明，在經聯合國宣布爲非怯前，英國當繼續本於條約以武器軍官及經費供給阿拉伯國，安理會如通過美國之決議案以採取憲章三十九條下的行動，由安理會以軍事行動制止巴勒斯坦之戰，則在採取此等行動之先勢必宣布英國之以武器供給阿拉伯國爲非法，外交界人士並相信，安理會茍不下令禁止以武器供給巴勒斯坦交戰雙方，則美國必將撤銷對中東之軍火林運令。紐約州之猶太人固已發動運動要求撤銷禁令，而猶太公會政治部長馬逸生夫人，亦已抵華盛頓，促請美政府下令解除禁令。</p>

<p>〔路透社合拉維夫廿日電〕哈迦那今日宣布，猶軍飛機初次出動，在東北綫之迦列里區轟炸阿拉伯軍之砲隊及裝田車隊，各機於完成任務後安然返防。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿日電〕巴勒斯坦整個局勢可能受目前在迦列里海南島進行中的猶阿大戰之影響，此乃猶阿兩軍第一次正而接戰。參戰之伊拉克·外約但及敘利亞軍，茍能在此戰中取得決定性的勝利，則自巴勒斯坦南部挻進的埃及軍，即可對台拉維夫週圍的猶軍主力展開全面攻勢。猶軍苟能支持伊拉克·外得但·敘利亞聯軍之攻勢，則埃及陸軍是否敢於貿然進攻集於台城附近之五萬猶軍，自尙須審維考慮。迦列里迤南阿拉伯聯軍之進攻，以飛機反裝甲車爲掩護，正傾師南下，進犯約但河流域各猶太移民區，並以巴勒斯坦東北之交通樞紐貝森城爲主要前標，貝森城如被佔領，則阿馬格登平原富庶的猶太移民區屏障盡失，阿拉伯聯軍更可與在約但山待命的其他外約但軍會師。巴勒斯坦其他各綫最近形勢如下：南綫埃及軍：埃軍已自迦薩迤北埃軍司令部所在的貝特哈隆，分兩翼推進左翼佔領迦薩北十哩之狄爾史奈，右翼佔領南部大城通至耶城公路上之皮爾許巴，東北綫：敘利亞軍於佔領迦列里海南端之薩馬格後，復向南推進佔領三哩外之西猶太村；東綫：猶軍自員森向北以扇形姿態推進迎戰伊拉克及外約但軍：北綫：黎巴嫩軍未聞有進展。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿一日廣播：耶路撒冷舊城區之百分之八十巳爲阿軍佔領，戰事已接近尾聲，刻阿軍已向猶軍之最後據點猛攻中。</p>
<p>〔合眾社聖城隨軍記者廿一日電〕阿拉伯軍廿一日談稱：衝過耶路撒冷古城之阿軍，業已佔領鄒山門，陷古城內之四千猶軍於孤立無援之境。猶軍發出案緊急電訊，向台拉維夫方面求援，謂除非援軍立即開到，彼等將被迫投降。此項訊息，巳爲阿軍截獲。聖城戰爭，僅在古城內進行。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教廿一日電〕阿拉伯軍已向被困舊城內之猶軍提出限於廿一日下午以前投降之最後通牒。猶軍公報謂，繳戰繼續在耶城舊城內進行，而同時，外約但軍則已安置砲位，揚言猶軍拒絕投降，即將總攻。聞耶城之中立國領事，已急電外約但王及台拉維天，籲請保全聖地。一般相信目前唯有由杜魯門直接致電以色列外長薛托克，令猶軍接受阿拉伯軍之最後通牒，始可免除聖蹟之厄運。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海一百零三家戲院劇場，近以不堪非法份子之騷擾，場地屢遭搗毀，甚至職工亦常有被歐打死傷情事，特聯合向當局呼籲，要求予以切實保障。據戲劇業公會理事長周劍唾宣稱：上海各戲院劇場每月所負擔之營業稅印花稅及代收娛樂捐，為數頗巨，彼等祇有盡義務而無被保障之權利，認為太不公平。現公會方面議決，按例每月廿三日各戲院應解繳財政局之稅款，決自本月份起暫存上海市銀行，在未獲當局切實保障辦法以前，不擬轉解財局。但彼等不認為此係「抗稅」之表示。再如月內此事不能獲有圓滿解決辦法，各戲院之下一步驟，並決定下月份起不再代收娛樂捐，將以「不合作」方式作為抗議。聞天蟾舞　與共舞　之對號座位，常有座位被強佔後，定票觀眾臨時無法入場，因而引起之糾紛，幾日必數十起。且有若干僅可容納觀眾四百人之小型劇場，看白戲者恒佔三百人之多，如稍不如意，則毆打繼至，戲場頓可變成戰場云。</p>

<p>遊園會於樂聲悠揚中開始，當由方治以主人地位致詞，略謂：「國民黨自始至終，即抱着還政於民的決心，因為本黨不能常此為諸葛亮，我們必須使四萬萬五千萬個阿斗，能够早日自立自主。可是在另外一方面，我們今後對國家所負的責任格外重大，而我們每一個同志應如何來加倍努力以完成這個建國重任，這確是我們每個同志目前應有的認識。今天　　在　　祝總統副總統就職的大會中，兄弟另有三點意思，提出貢獻，共同勉勵力行。</p>
<p>方治貢獻三點意見</p>
<p>第一，我們應為主義而奮鬥，我們大家都看到總統在昨天就職的訓示中，一再諄諄的提及要改革政治，穩固經濟，和安定社會三大問題，凡是本黨的忠實同志，必須要在總裁這個改革政治穩固經濟安定社會偉大的號召，努力奮鬥，以求其實現。第二，我們　　民眾而奮鬥本黨的基礎在民眾，黨員要站在民眾的立場，代表民眾說話，為民眾解除痛苦，為民眾謀福利，隨時隨地替民眾服務，為民眾奮鬥。第三，我們要為政府而奮鬥，各位要知道我們的政府，締造艱難，是本黨黨員與全國民眾流血流汗犧牲奮鬥得來的。現在的政府，就是人民的政府，為全國人民所一致擁護的政府，所以本黨同志擁護行憲政府，一面要積極推行政令，協助建設，另一方面要加強戡亂剿匪的工作，一德一心，矢忠矢勇，為政府而奮鬥。</p>

<h3 id="c149">佛教對于宋代理學的影響 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 季羨林</p>
<p>這確是一個「大題」；但我却只能「小做」。佛教對宋代理學有很大的影響，這幾乎已經成了一個公認的事實現在沒有那一個哲學史家亦會再否認了。但一般人注意到的差不多全是思想方面的影響。馮芝生（友蘭）先生在他的中國哲學史下册第十二童（頁八〇〇—）裏討論韓愈和李翱的思想，結論說；</p>
<p>「由上所言，則宋明道學之基礎及輪廓在唐代已由韓愈李翱確定矣；而李之所貢獻尤較韓爲大，其學說所受佛學之影響尤爲顯然」。謝無量中國哲學史第三編上頁一也說：</p>
<p>「宋之大儒，多與進門往還，其討論性命之說，故宜有相契發者；惟於人事倫理，所持各異耳。」都說的是宋代理學在思想方面受了佛學的影饗。蔣維喬楊大膺中國哲學史綱要卷下頁四說：</p>
<p>「自來學者都說宋明理學和佛學的深切關係在乎根本思想，我們則認爲祗在乎方怯。由方法的相同，所以外表上彼此有些類似；其實兩家的思想雖有一二相通的地方，而根本上，一是世間怯，一是出世間怯，實在是永火不相容的。」</p>
<p>我不明白，他所謂「方法」究竟是指的什麼。此外中外學者討論佛教和理學的關係的遠非常多，幾乎都是從大處着眼，研究兩家思想方面的關係。我在這裏不能一一列舉了。</p>
<p>在這篇小文裏，我不能，而且也不敢，討論思想方面的大問題。我只想指出一件過去似乎還沒有人注意到過的小事情，讓大家注意。中國理學家除了討論哲學問題以外，多半還都用一番實踐的工夫，克治私慾就是這實踐的工夫之一。淸尹銘綬學規舉隅卷上入德之方在呌做「克治」的」段裏引朱子的話說：</p>
<p>「朱子曰：前輩有欲澂治思慮者，於坐處置兩器。每起一善念，則投白豆一粒於器中；每起一惡念，則投黑豆ｇ　粒於器中。初時黑豆多，白豆少，後來隨不復有黑豆，最後則雖白豆亦無之矣。然此只是個死法，若更加以讀書窮理底工夫，則去那般不正當底思慮，何難之有？」</p>
<p>我不知道這方怯究竟有多少人實行，只記得在別的書裏也看到過實行這方法的理學家，可見實行這方法的人不在少數。我們初看這方怯，恐怕沒有人會想到這不是「國貨」，我最初也以爲，只有中國，而且只有中國的理學家，纔能發明這一個滑稽而笨拙的「死法」。但我後來竟然在中詳大藏經裏找到牠的來源。賢愚經卷第十在，（六七）優波毱提品第六十講到一個故事，說阿難的弟子耶貫韃，奉持佛法。他聽說某一個居士生了一個孩子，於是他就去向居士索要，「欲使爲道」。居士不肯。後來他又生了一個孩子，仍然不肯讓他當和尙。</p>
<p>「此耶貫錡是阿羅漢，三明具足，能知人根。觀此二兒，興道無緣，亦自息意，不殷懃求。時彼居士復更生男，顏貌端妙，形相殊特。時耶貫鞄復往從索。其公報口：「兒今猶小，未能奉事，又復家貧，無以餉送。且欲停之，須大當與。」年漸長大，才器益盛。父付財物，居肆販賣。時耶買韃往到其邊，而爲說法。教使繫念。以白黑石子，用當籌算。善念下白，惡念下黑。優波匈提奉受其教，善惡之念，輒投石子。初黑偏多，白者甚少。漸漸修習，白黑正等。繁念不止，更無黑石，純有白者。善念已盛，逮得</p>
<p>初果。」（大正新修大藏經，第四卷，頁四四二下）</p>
<p>這個「繫念」的方法，伺宋代理學家所用的那個方法，除了黑白豆子和黑白石子一點區別外，完全一樣。倘若宋代理學家根本沒同佛經接觸過的話，我們或者還能說，這是偶合；但事實上他們却同佛經的關係非常深切，所以我們只能說，這是有意的假借。這個貌似地道中國貨的方法原來也是跟佛教從印度傳過來的。從這個小例子，我們可以看出來，宋代理學不但在大的思想方面受了佛教的影響，迎許多人們平常不注意的末節也居然受到佛教的影響了。（三十七年五月十一日於北京大學）（中）</p>
<h3 id="c150">印度文法理論的根本問題 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 金克木</p>
<p>追問這理論，我們就得溯到波你尼以前去。波你尼雖然往後來說是不祧之祖，但往以前說，他也只是集大成的殿軍。依印度文籍流傳習慣，一種學說累積到成了定型之後，便有一書將以前的層次全抹去，代替所有前身而自爲一「經」。在這種情形下，「波你尼經」便成了這一類書中獨存的一部，無怯再灘其源。然而在文怯學之外，古印度還有字源學也是正統學問的「六吠陀支」之一。字源學即所謂「尼祿多」，現在也存有一部同名的書。雖然那書和「波你尼經」一樣，都不必是原有「六吠陀支」中的典籍，而且那也只是另一部殘缺的吠陀難字彙，所謂「尼堪都」，的註，但其中却保有一段討論這根本文怯理論問題的紀錄。」尼祿多」一書的作者耶斯迦（Yaska）又是在波你尼以前，所以這是關於這問題的現存的最古的材料。</p>
<p>耶斯迦在「尼祿多」第一章的討論中承認詞類共有四種：「名」詞，「述」詞，「助」詞，「投」詞。（「助」詞用玄奘「成唯識論」卷六所譯，餘係暫擬。）「述」詞又可分六種：生，存，變，增，减，滅。但這是一人一派之說，只有四種詞類似乎是當時通行的意見。四類中自然是「助」「投」本身不再變，而「名」「述」還得再有變化。這兩者的變化是文法的主要內容，而兩者的關係，即一切字的本原問題，便成爲文法理論的基本討論題目。</p>
<p>耶斯迦先下定義說：（一九四〇年浦那校刋本，有的解釋用校者Rajavade說，下同。）</p>
<p>「凡此〔諸字〕皆四「句類」：名，述，助，投。此中且禾名及述相。以「作」爲本。即是述「相」。以「有」爲本，乃是名「相」。此中二者兼在，以「作」爲本。前後所「作」是名爲「作」，以述而示，〔如〕行及烹，以開始起，以完畢終。既定爲「有」，以「有」名〔示〕，〔如〕行及烹。「此」者乃示諸「有」〔同相〕。牛，馬，人，象，〔乃示分相〕。「作」者〔乃示）「作」之〔同相〕。坐，臥，行，立，〔乃示分相〕」。（一章一節。方括弧中字譯文增，下同。「作」依鳩摩羅什「中論」譯怯，是「聖人不作」「大雅不作」之「作」，在此與「有」對照。實則在中文這字也是「有」，但在梵文中是兩字根，所指有很大區別。這「有」的問題很有趣味，另有拙文論之。「同相」「分相」本可作「共相」「殊相」，此處避用，以免混淆。）</p>
<p>「作」與「有」同指存在，但前者指一件行爲的過程，後者指一件行爲的完成。前者分觀其變化之動，後者綜觀其整體之靜。所以前者用「述」詞表現，而後者用「名」詞。如果一件行爲有前後階段的分別，那便是動作，就要用「述」詞表現。一件動作是有起頭有結尾的。如果固定了，完成了，那便是一件事，而不是動作，要籠括全體，要用「名」詞表現了。前面的「行」及「烹」是動詞形式，後面的「行」及「烹」是名詞形式。「此」也算名詞，實是代名詞，能代一切。「牛馬」等便是分別指定。「作」也是一切動作行爲總名，「坐臥」等才加以分別。「有」是Being「作」是Becoming是兩種存在。</p>
<p>現在我們看「述」出於一名」的原理，及其反對方面。聖斯迦說：</p>
<p>如是所列四種「句類」，名，述，助，投。此中名者皆是述生，是娑迦吒衍說，亦尼縣多家說。非謂一切，是伽嚇伽說亦有文典家如是說。」（一章十二節）</p>
<p>這兩方面爭論的話，爲明白起見，我且讓他們自己用容易的現代話來說。耶斯迦先紀錄下伽聲伽的反對理由：</p>
<p>「由音與形（增音）依文法規則變出來的有意義的字，如果與由根變出的意議相符合，便是公認的字。〔不符合字義的字根便不能認爲來源。〕如牛，馬，人，象。假如一切「名」詞都出於「述」詞，那駛，有同樣行爲的，便該有同樣的名字了。凡是佔了路的都照呌做馬了。凡是能刺的都該呌做草了。假若「名」詞都出於「述」詞，那麼，有多少種行爲便該有多少個名字了。那麼，柱子應該也可以呌做「臥洞」（立於洞中故）或「緊連」（支持樑故）了。而且由行爲依文怯造出的「名」詞應該明白表示其意義，人，馬，草，都該改換字形了。（例略）而且在巳經通用（公認）的〔字〕上還得仔細想一想。「地」據說是「展開來的」。誰來展開它？什麼東西支持着〔那展開它的人〕？而且意義不相符合的字，娑迦吒衍又從這些字與那些字各取一半來雜凑。（例略）而且大家說存在是在行動以前的。把後來的行爲去呌先存在的東西是不合道理的。因此這種說法不合道理。」（一章十二節十三節）</p>
<p>尼祿多家的答辯：</p>
<p>「鳴呼，是何言哉哉！你說：「由音與形依文法規則變出來的有意義的字，如果與由根變出的意義相符合，便都是由根變出來的字」。照這樣說，這不算駁倒〔我們的理論〕。例如，你說：「有伺樣行爲的便該有同樣的名字」。我們看到做同樣事的人有些有同樣的名字，有些却沒有。（例略）由此一說，你後來的駁論也答覆了。例如，你說：「由行爲依文法造出的「名」詞應該明白表示其意義」。有一些字雖只由一字變出，而且用直接字尾，却很少應用。（例略）例如，你說：「在已經通用的（字）上還得仔細想一想」，〔本來是〕在已經通用的字上研究它的構成的。你說：「地」，據說是「展開來的」。誰來展開它？什麼東西支持着〔那展開它的人〕？」看見它是展開在那兒，〔便呌它做展開的〕，即使沒有另外展開〔它〕的人。照你這樣，凡看見了東西以後起名字的都該受責備了。例如，你說：一從這些字與那些字各取一半來雜凑。」那個不顧字義不合而雜浸的人才該受批許呢。這就是那種人的批評。例如，你說：「把後來的行為去呌先存在的東西是不合道理的」。我們看到有一些光已生下的東西由後來的行爲得名的，也有些不是。（例略）」（一章十四節）</p>
<p>反對派畢竟失敗了。字源學家征服了文法學家。「名」詞出於「述」詞，一切物得名都由於行爲。這種原則成了文法家的信條。「波你尼經」以動詞語根爲基本，而且「助」詞已不獨立，「投」詞只算「名」飼落掉了尾巴。所以由傳統的一千九百四十三個語根，照三千九百九十六句「經」來變化，便包括了標準梵語的全部現象乃至吠陀語的）例外</p>
<p>（下）</p>
<p>這種文怯理論的得失，以及對其前後文怯學及字源學研究的因果歷史關係，不必在此討論，我所想指出的只是這種理論中所埋伏的印度思想的一點根苗。</p>
<p>「名」出於「述」，語根都是動詞，存在的究竟是行動的綜合。文法理論家把紛紜的語言現象，就實際活在口頭的聲音，加以層層剖析之後，並沒有得到抽象的概念，却只得到變動不居的行爲。靜止的只是覆在上面的綜合，或則是動作的完成與不可解析的整體。沒有形式的，數學的，邏輯的思考，只有具體現象的分析與綜合。動是可分，靜是綜合而不可分。以動爲本，若向分析方面發展，可以到不可再分的多元的「極微」等，也可以再破去而得一極端無常的動，乃至超乎動。若向綜合方面發展，便可以在無常之上見常，可分中見有超越的不可分。由於見動，才重求「寂」。不過無論怎樣發展都是由具體的動的現象出發的，不是概念的，數學的，形式邏輯的。雖然後來的所謂文怯家的哲學理論只是在別的方面，但由這早期所爭論的根本問題上，已可看出與整個印度思想血脈相關的思路，因而與西方邏輯觀念下的出發點恰相對比。若對中國來說，也許可以戲言，印度相信口語的咒音和手指動作的訣印，而中國道家相信筆畫的符錄。中國舊日的字源學也許正是印度的反對方向罷？（重音重形之分鄭樵巳說到。）</p>
<p>不過我的話已經說遠了。再論下去，牽涉太大，是非難定，不免貽笑於通人大雅。便把這點拋開不論，能知道我們常說的語根在開始討論時是怎麼回事，是在什麼樣的系統下才有可能成爲基幹，而這種系統又與基於抽象概念及邏輯的系統如何有所不同，天概也不是無益的罷？（完）</p>
<h3 id="c151">關於「王韜的卒年」 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 彭澤益</p>
<p>申報「文史」週刋第十五期發表徐光摩的「王韜的卒年」一文根據繆少初梅墅吟草序考證王韜卒于光結二十三年丁酉冬季。胡適之先生特在編輯後記裏說，曾經也有人告訴他與此相同的一個考蹬。但因忘記是何人考訂的，希望有人指出，並望申報館方面能查查當日的舊報，替王韜的卒年「作一個最後的定論」。經查申報，似乎亦無結果。</p>
<p>去年九月間，羅香枓先生從廣州到南京來，承他送我一本「國父之大學時代」書中的考證有幾處小誤，即如其中論到到王韜與孫中山先生的關係，有一段說：</p>
<p>「王韜在光組初葉，雖以深通洋務著稱，據陳少白先生「興中會革命史要」，亦謂國父于光緒二十年至上海時竹與相值，上李鴻章書曾紉王氏修故……據「逸經」第三十三期陳國松著「長毛狀元王韜」，韜早干光緒十六年病卒。國父曾否與王氏相值，實成問題。疑國父在鄭觀應家所見而介紹赴津見羅豐祿者爲另一友人，朱必即爲王韜。果爾則上李鴻章書更與王韜無涉矣。」</p>
<p>我告訴羅先生，王韜死于光緒二十三年，書中引據的材料謂死于光緒十六年是錯的。羅先生表示此書寫干戰時重慶，史料搜集不易，無法詳加考證。這倒是實在的情形。伺時我又人對他說，中山先生上李鴻章書王韜代爲修改事，陳少白的記戲可信，事實如此並無損於中山先生的偉大。</p>
<p>當時我說王韜死於光緒二十三年，是根據蕭一山先生的「淸代學者著述表」，和吳靜山的「王韜事蹟考略」（載於「上海研究資料」民國二十五年中華版），這是徐光摩先生和胡先生的朋友RoswellS．Britton所沒有見及的材料。吳靜山替王韜一生事略編了一個年表，謂生於道光八年戊子十月初四日，一光緒二十三年丁酉，七十歲。夏四月卒於城西草堂。」案姚文枬等纂「上海縣續志」卷三十「雜記」謂王韜「晚購屋西城，顏曰城西草堂。」可見他是在光緒二十三年四月間死於上海的寓中。</p>
<p>可督的是，上海縣續志修於州民國初年，民國七年五月刊行，記事「斷自同治十年以後，迄穴統三年，以完全結束一代之文獻」（吳馨序中語）。書中對王韜的記載，竟如此節略，主稿人之所以在卷末「雜記」中提他一筆，期然是著有「瀛瓀雜志六卷，敘述滬事極稱詳略」的原故。民國曹允源纂的吳縣志中也未見被述及，僅在卷五十七藝文考三中列舉其書目若干種而巳。</p>
<p>吳靜山記王韜去世年月，調據「蔡爾康鑄鐵港讀書應事隨筆稿本」，這是一種不經見因而頗爲珍貴的史料。稿本的作者是上海人，中西文字修養不壞，早期廣學會的出版物，大多是他所迻譯，常署名為「樓署仙史蔡爾康」，為滬上的有名文人。光結元年申報仿聚珍版印行王韜的「甕關餘談」（八卷），蔡爾康曾替他作了一篇長序，字裏行間，顯見他們交誼頗深。所以他所說的王韜去世的年月必極可靠。</p>
<p>據上所說，王韜的生年是道光八年十月初四日，即西曆一八二八年十一月十日，此與胡先生所提到恒慕義主編的「淸代名人傳略一中Rosmell　S．Britton的記載（Ibld．，11，P．836）相合。至於卒年與徐光聖先生引蹬梅墅吟草序謂死於光緒二十三年丁酉亦相符合，當無問題。惟月份不同，一在夏季四月，一在冬季。這兩說源頭雖然都是出自王韜的朋友，無論如何總有一說是錯的。我願把這個考證結果告訴徐先生，希望能作進一步的研討。</p>
<p>（三七年三月二十夜，南京）。</p>
<p>後記</p>
<p>本刋第十五期登出徐光豐先生的「王韜的卒年」一文，當時我曾寫一段後記，說我在前年聽脫上海已有人考定王韜死在光緒二十三年，亨年七十歲，並曾將此項老證結果記在一本世界年表上，但沒有註出來源，也沒有說是何人考定的，因此我很希望有人指出此說的來源與根據、給王韜的死年作一個最後的定論，後來我在南方旅行，收到張天松，譚正豐，彭澤益諸先生寄來文章，都指明最先考定王韜生卒的是吳靜山先生的「王韜事蹟考略」，載在「上海研究資料」上。今將彭先生的文章刊布於此，並向譚正豐張天松兩先生敬致謝意。</p>

<h3 id="c152">商君精神 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>最近國內有一個公務機關的合作社（？）職員，以貪污牙膏三管，襯衫一件，計值已趨過「貪污」「千元以上」，依法判處無期徒刑。</p>
<p>許多人認爲這是墨守十年以前的成法，而在人情上是有些「過份」的。</p>
<p>但我覺得未可厚非。法治的精神是「信」。爲了取信於民而稍稍不近人情的，有商君對於人民移動一根太頭而實踐千金重賞，以表未立法之嚴正的史例。同樣是矯枉過正，但在未習慣於法治的國家，而欲厲行法治，倒的確必須做幾件矯枉過正不大近人情的事，表示怯治精神的硬性，神聖不移，表示大事小事一樣的鐵面無私，才能收廉頑立懦的宣傳效果。</p>
<p>因之我們雖然同情這位三管牙膏一件襯衫的貪污犯的不幸，一面覺得倘若因此而收到怯治精神之貫激的效果，未嘗不是一件可喜的事，倒也不必爲一二人惜的。</p>
<p>但商君精神也不是無保留的可以師怯的，例如「太子犯法刑其師傳一在當時已經覺得是商缺的了不起的不茍不徇，而在今天以來，仍然是「刑不上大夫」的意思，充此意思至極，仍不免於竊鈎者誅，竊國者依然是候。而對於中國今天的厲行法治——懲治貪污的需要恰恰是大忌，差以毫厘，往往便會謬以千里，不免收到相反的效果。表示不持虎鬚，即是替老虎長了咸風。「殺鷄嚇猴子」則可，嚇老虎却不可也</p>
<h3 id="c153">我也一談施肇基 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>前幾天，凌霄漢閣主曾談到老外交家施肇基，施氏在外交界的作風是和其他的不同，趁此機緣，便一談施氏在外交界的略歷。</p>
<p>近代浙江外交界的人才極盛。如汪大爕，孫寶　，胡惟德，沈瑞麟，黃郛與施肇基，王正廷等，便是鐵中錚錚的。</p>
<p>施肇基，別字植之，係浙江的杭縣人，現年六十九歲，是前淸舉人施則敬的兒子。在上海聖約翰書院畢業後，即到美國留學，初入華盛頓高等學校，繼入康乃爾大學，在美十年，得碩士學位。光緒二十九年歸國，任兩湖總督張之洞的洋務文案。第二年，任留美學生監督到美國去。無何，任考察各國政治大臣一等參贊官，那時淸廷正派載澤，戴鴻慈，徐世昌，端方，紹英等分赴東西洋各國考察憲政。不久，施氏返國，歷任郵傳部王事，京漢鐵路行車正監督，濱江關道等職。到了宣統三年，他轉任吉林交涉使，外務部左右丞。不久，任駐美·墨·祕·古公使，但因辛亥年秋武漢起義，他就沒有出國。</p>
<p>民國元年，唐紹儀任第一任內閣總理，他任交通總長，可是因爲部裏多屬郵傳部的老吏，他指揮不靈，只得辭職，轉任總統府大禮官。民國三年六月，出任駐英公使，在職六年多，民九的十月，轉任駐美公使。民十二的一月，張紹　標　和平統一政策，提出施氏任外交總長，因爲沒有得到國會的同意，他就沒有到任，而由黃郛署理。過了些時，張閣因天津保定兩派，想着推倒黎元洪，說張閣裏而還有黎系的閣員，倡言打倒張閣。故沒有多時，張閣也倒了。施氏因政潮關係，再度出任駐美公使。民十四，他任關稅會議的全權代表。民十五，直系勢刀恢復，顏惠慶出任外交總長，而且攝行大總統職務，施氏曾被任爲外交部長，但也沒有到任。及到國民政府成立，他纔出任駐英公使。</p>
<p>「九一八」藩陽事件發生，日閥佔踞東北，我國向國際聯盟會伸訴，他任國聯會我國代表，聲訴日本的佔踞東北。是破壞國際公法，侵奪中國主權，請會員國主張公這，加以援助，深得國際的同情。</p>
<p>民二十年的十月，政府又任他爲外交部長，也沒有到任。二十二年一月，任駐美公使，二十四年陞爲駐美全權大使，民二十六卸職，由王正廷繼任。</p>

<p>他個性很老實，觸於穩健一派，不冒險，不給功，所謂脚踏實地的幹，他就是這樣的人物。</p>
<h3 id="c154">關於「慈母」 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 念新</p>
<p>世俗通以「嚴父」及「慈毋」爲父母之別稱，如家嚴令慈云云。前者書無異議，獨慈母之稱，實非嫡母或生母之謂。顧亭林日知錄卷五，「慈母如母」項云：「慈母者何，子幼而母死，養於父妾，父卒，爲之三年所以報其鞠育之恩也。」蓋慈母之於嫡子，因其長之育之之勞，故服喪應「如母」，且其服亦必待父命，不可自專其報也。其次，王壬秋「與祥故事」，有云：「恭忠王母，文宗（咸豐）慈母也。全太后以託康慈貴妃，貴妃舍其子而乳文宗，故與王如親昆弟。　是慈母云云，本有實際內容，而世所以慈代母之稱者，或以女性多慈祥之故。然李令伯（密）陳情表中，有「生孩六月，慈父見背」之語，則「慈」字尙可用之於父，與嚴父適相反，豈李父亦非其生父歟？鄙意就今日流行已久之習慣言之，單用一「慈」字或無不可（如先怒令慈），若逕以「慈母」代嫡母或生母則乘矣。</p>
<h3 id="c155">西點的新作風 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 糾糾</p>
<p>首先讓我來一下註解：這「西點」是美國歷史最悠久的西點軍官學校，並非「奶油西點」的「西點」。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰引起了戰略與戰術上的大革命，因之，負責訓練軍隊幹部的西點也就採取了全新的教授法。美國的軍隊，不久也言京會全部改觀，一掃舊式軍人的習氣，而成爲一個更强大的，更科學化的，更脚踏實地的隊伍。</p>
<p>譬如，在第二次大戰中有許多受過高等教育的年靑將校常以溫文和易而又極堅毅勇敢的口氣指揮作戰，決不像售式軍官那樣大呌「命令是命令，軍人祗應當服從！」但事實上那些年靑將校往往極能博得十卒愛戴，而那些專門直着嗓子擺長官架子的舊式軍官却常使得部隊中怨聲載道，效率大爲减少。美軍當局對於這稱情形是很淸楚的，於是西點的教育方怯也就朝對了新的方向走去。</p>
<p>以前，西點的高年級學生可以對低年級生頤指氣使，差不多當他們傭人一樣，現在，這個一百四十多年來的傳統，已經完全打破。西點整個的軍事教育中，巳揚棄了以前那些祗朮形式的作風。西點的學監泰勒　將說：「我們的軍官中不　容　那些濫竿充數的人們存在。我們軍人的任務，已一年一年地更趨艱難盤復。我們所需要的軍官，必須是第一流的領袖；更要緊的，是他們必須深諳人情世故，善於應付人事問題。我們現在就要訓練出這一種軍官來。」</p>
<p>這種話，在舊式軍官看來是完全胡鬧，他們祗知道硬幹—爲了維持自己的威信，不惜博剛愎自用之名。但是，時代燮了，老頑固已無容身之地。西點目前最重要的一門學科，就是「軍事領袖心理學」。負責教授這一、門學科的教官明白地告訴學生：在戰鬥中，無論是誰，心裏總是有些恐懼的，在這種時候，做長官的人必須竭力抑制自己的恐懼，而以鎭靜出之；如果能使士兵們有事可做，就多少可以减輕一些他們的恐懼。</p>
<p>那位教官再三諄囑他的學生，在發佈命令的時候，措詞必須精確，絕對不能有一絲一亳的含糊，不能誇張，不能躁急。</p>
<p>有一次上課時，教官出了一個問題，呌學生回答。問題是：如果你是一個營長，明大有幾位要人來參觀你駐紮的陣地，也許要檢閱。而你的一營中有一個士兵名呌哈里斯的，平常還肯努力，而每逢受檢閱時，總是神絕過份緊張，步伐不能整齊。現在要想法子呌哈里斯不參加這次檢閱，而又使他不失面子，你應當如何處置？</p>
<p>接着，他指定一個學生出來做營長，他自己做那個哈里斯，他說：「假定你是營長，剛把我呌進來—現在開始。」</p>
<p>那位「營長」躊躇了好久，說：「告訴你—關於這次檢閱的事情—團長說你可以免予參加，反正有幾部卡軍也要集合候檢的，你就坐在卡車上照看照看罷。」</p>
<p>接淸就是討論。同學們對這位「營長」大表不滿。照他這樣辦怯，第一，哈里斯的心裘一定不高興，第二，把不要哈里斯參加的責任推到團長身上去，也不見高明。</p>
<p>第二個「營長」却不同了。他先對哈里斯說「請坐」，然後給他一支香烟。於是誠懇地說：「哈里斯，你大概已經知道明天有幾位要人要來。我現在派你做他們的副官，代表我們的部隊招待他們。這是一種光榮，我想也無須我多說了。他們巡閱的時候，你就隨侍在旁。我相信你一定會給他們一個很好的印象。」</p>
<p>這個做怯立刻得到了大家的贊美。</p>
<p>你說在這種細枝末節上做功夫未免不大值得嗎？等到一旦兵臨危地的時候，你就會知道這些「哈里斯」們是何等的重要了！西點的二千學生大多都已紉在二次大戰中身歷我行，他們一致認爲這種「爭取士兵愛戴」的教育是最有價值的一門學科！</p>

<p>— 章礝石</p>
<p>賣買汽軍，在德國是項容易賺錢的商業。在柏林，有些美國官員因爲奉命返國在即，旅途上攜帶不便，往往把自備汽車出讓，倒獲得了意外的收入。</p>
<p>一個美軍翻譯員，他在六個月之前買進一輛輕便的美國式汽車，價值一千五百元（美金）。在這六個月之中，道汽車共替他代步約一萬哩，目前他因回國在即，便決定將這汽車出讓，結果以二千三百五十元成交，他不但白乖了一萬哩路程，又賺到了入百五十元。</p>
<p>一個美軍聯絡官，在一年前以二千二百元的代價購進一輛大客軍，在這一年中行駛了三萬哩的路程，而月前他在出讓時，除掉二千二百元的本錢之外，他還獲利一千五百五十元。</p>
<p>一位美國軍曹在六個月前購進一輛一九三九式的二門輕便汽軍（德國製的），當時價值三百七十五元，而現在他却售得了一千元。</p>
<p>當戰爭結束的時候，在德國曾經有過「香烟換汽車Cigaret—te　Automobile」的奇聞。當時，五十盒美國香烟可以換得一輛流綫型的輕便汽車。</p>
<p>近來，美國駐軍當局有鑒於德國汽車的缺乏嚴重，乃實施進口大量美國汽車的策略。同時更嚴禁美軍官佐的販買汽車，並禁止返國美軍於出讓自備汽車時獲得非當利潤。凡返國之美軍出讓自備汽車時，獲利達一千二百元以上者，如被查出，當罰其將全部利潤歸還汽車的得主。</p>
<p>有一位名呌約翰生的美軍少尉，他就是觸霉頭的一個。他在返國前將自備汽車出讓，獲利達一千五百元，超出了當局所規定的限額，結果是被調查出來了，結果他只得依法將一千五百元不折不扣地歸還給汽車的受主。自制法以來，他還是第一位被懲罰的人。</p>

<p>於是銀行便因此發明了旅行支票，而郵局也因而仿效，結果匯票·本票及支票簡直是三位一體，用起來便利得多了。</p>
<p>可惜我們所用的鈔票和郵票却沒有採用支票式的空白，否則隨用隨塡，豈不是更加省力麼？</p>

<h3 id="e1">He Yingqin Possibly to Head the Executive Yuan; Intense Persuasion Continues Late into Last Night; Zhang Qun Takes Ten Days Leave and Flies from Nanjing to Chongqing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The selection of the new Premier of the Executive Yuan is receiving active attention from all sides. Political activities in the capital on the 21st also appeared to center on this issue. However, as of midnight, the selection of the Premier had not yet been finalized. Judging from the trends on the 21st, He Yingqin has a high possibility of assuming the post of the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the constitutional government. However, Mr. He himself continues to express firm refusal, and various parties are currently engaged in intense persuasion. Zhang Qun's departure from Nanjing for Chongqing at noon on the 21st indicates his determination not to assume the post of the new Premier of the Executive Yuan. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mr. Zhang has no possibility of being nominated. Nevertheless, the results of the informal vote among Kuomintang legislators on the morning of the 21st confirmed that He Yingqin has already gained the support of a larger number of legislators. Mr. He's residence was crowded with visitors throughout the day on the 21st, and some legislators also visited him to urge him to form the new cabinet. However, Mr. He still followed his doctor's orders on the afternoon of the 21st and visited Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, only returning in the evening. When a reporter visited him at 11 p.m. on the 21st, Mr. He still stated that he had not considered this matter, and his will seemed very firm. The Legislative Yuan, which is awaiting the President's nomination of candidates for Premier so that it can discuss whether to agree, adjourned throughout the day on the 21st. No session has been scheduled for the morning of the 22nd. If the President's message of nomination for Premier can be submitted before noon on the 22nd, the Legislative Yuan will prepare to hold a plenary committee meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd so that it can be quickly approved. It is understood that Zhang Qun will stay in Chongqing for about a week. After the nomination of the new Premier is proposed and passed, he will still return to Nanjing to handle the handover of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke paid respects to the President three times on the 21st. When he paid respects at noon, he was accompanied by Wu Tiecheng to report on the opinions of the Kuomintang legislators' discussion meeting regarding the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Mr. Sun was also extremely busy throughout the day, and he was still meeting with Wu Tiecheng at midnight. The activities of Chen Lifu were all centered on the formation of the cabinet when he visited He Yingqin at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Kuomintang legislators gathered at the Central Party Headquarters at 10 a.m. on the 21st to exchange views on the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Sun Ke presided over the meeting and immediately reported that the President believed that the exercise of the right of consent approved by the Legislative Yuan on the 20th might be difficult to implement and hoped that the party members would make some remedies. Regarding the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the President had solicited the opinions of Zhang Qun and He Yingqin. Both Zhang and He expressed humility, so he also hoped that the party legislators could provide candidates for Premier for reference. Subsequently, the legislators spoke one after another. Some legislators believed that Article 55 of Chapter 8 "Exercise of the Right of Consent" of the Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan stipulates that "If the plenary committee meeting deems it necessary, it may request the President to notify the nominee to submit policy opinions," which can also be interpreted as not necessarily requiring the submission of policy opinions. In case of difficulty, the original provisions can still be used flexibly. As for the candidate issue, the legislators did not have strong objections to the two candidates, Zhang and He, proposed by the President. Sun Ke then proposed conducting a secret ballot to determine the opinions of each legislator. The legislators then proceeded with the vote. The results were not announced, but it was rumored that He Yingqin received the most votes, followed by Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng. This result will be reported by Sun Ke to the President for reference.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Zhang Qun, accompanied by Zhou Junliang, flew from Nanjing to Chongqing at 5 p.m. on the 21st. The purpose of his trip was to visit his 85-year-old mother, who has a leg condition. She recently broke her leg and came to Chongqing from Chengdu for treatment. Before leaving Nanjing, Mr. Zhang paid respects to President Chiang, who approved his ten-day leave. Executive Yuan affairs will be handled by Vice Premier Wang Yunwu. He firmly declined to organize the new cabinet and hopes that General He Yingqin will assume this important responsibility. Whether he will go to Chengdu is currently undecided.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Zhang Qun answered reporters' questions on the 21st regarding his return to Chongqing and the nomination of the first Premier of the Executive Yuan during the constitutional period: "I left Chongqing in February of last year and it has been 15 months since then. During this period, I am very pleased that the construction of the city has progressed rapidly due to the efforts of all parties. Over the past year, the Executive Yuan has had heavy tasks, and I feel physically and mentally exhausted. Three months ago, I suffered from tracheitis, which interfered with my sleep. Because I could not rest, it has not healed yet. Now that the constitutional government is about to begin and the Executive Yuan is about to be reorganized, my mother has arrived in Chongqing, and I very much hope to return home to visit her. Therefore, I asked the President for ten days of leave to return to Sichuan Province to visit my mother and rest briefly. After the leave, I will still return to Nanjing. During my absence from Nanjing, Executive Yuan affairs will be handled by Vice Premier Wang. Now that the country is undergoing a period of great change and the government is being reorganized, the people of the country are seeking new ideas and changes. The country's politics should adapt to this requirement and seek progress through change. The future tasks of the Executive Yuan will become increasingly heavy. I have felt very tired over the past year and my health has declined. I have firmly declined the nomination for Premier of the Executive Yuan."</p>

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 21st] Communist Radio quoted a report from The New York Times on the 20th, broadcasting that the U.S. military advisory group stationed in China has made extensive "demands" to the central government, including the right to design overall guidance and to send U.S. military liaison agencies to the battlefield to supervise operations.

<h3 id="e24">Opposing Draper's Non-Reparations Theory <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Royal issued a report on May 19th regarding Draper's inspection of Japan and Korea. The key points are as follows: First, Draper proposed reducing Japanese reparations to 165 million U.S. dollars. Second, he requested immediate large-scale economic aid to Japan to revitalize its production and develop its trade, especially emphasizing Sino-Japanese trade. After the release of this report, in addition to unanimous warm welcome from all sectors in Japan, it was attacked by relevant countries in the Far East. Wu Banchen, the head of our reparations team in Japan, issued a statement on the 20th, severely criticizing its absurd content. According to the New Asia News Agency in Tokyo, the U.S. State Department may not adopt the opinions in the report. However, regardless of the U.S. State Department's attitude, the blatant support for Japan in the "Draper Report" is a fact, and it is the most noticeable in a series of facts about the U.S. support for Japan. We in China cannot remain silent about this.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the origin of the Draper Report. After the war, U.S. policy toward Japan was decided separately by the Department of the Army and the State Department. In recent years, the Department of the Army has been more dominant and has gained considerable decision-making power. For a period of time, the Japan policies of the Department of the Army and the State Department differed slightly. On February 26th of this year, the State Department suddenly announced the dispatch of policy committee member Kennan to Tokyo to investigate the situation in Japan. After Kennan returned home from his investigation, the newspapers did not mention a word about his views on Japan. Then, the Department of the Army sent Under Secretary of the Army Draper with a delegation, including some Japanese entrepreneurs, and they arrived in Tokyo on March 20th, went to Seoul on the 28th, and left Japan for the U.S. on April 2nd. Draper's activities in Japan, its grand scale and shocking discussions, turned into the "Factory of Asia" plan, causing Hitoshi Ashida and a thousand others to be overjoyed. The secretary of the current investigation team) drafted the report. Roundston is a member of the "Overseas Survey Association," and his views are the same as those of Strack: the United States must support Japan, reduce Japanese reparations, and develop Japanese industry and trade. Although we have not seen the full text of the Draper Report, we can judge by observing his person and his words that this report is nothing more than an extension and expansion of the Strack Report.</p>
<p>The Draper Report was released by Secretary of the Army Royal. In terms of authority, the Department of the Army does not have the authority to release this document. Since Royal resolutely released it, making it known to the world, the spirit of this report fully represents the intentions of the U.S. government, at least the intentions of the U.S. Department of the Army. As for the essence of this report, first, it is to reduce Japanese reparations to 165 million U.S. dollars, and it advocates that "Japanese assets abroad, such as assets in the Northeast, Taiwan, and other regions that have fallen into the hands of the Soviet Union and China, should be formally recognized and written off." It also states that machines and industrial equipment within Japanese military factories should be transferred for reparations under limited conditions. Second, the report advocates large-scale economic aid to Japan, because Japan currently lacks raw materials and food. If Japan's industrial level can be improved (the report points out that Japan's current industrial level is less than 45% of the 1930-34 average), all countries will trade with it. In the end, it will not only benefit Japan, but also benefit the United States and other countries. The recovery of Japan's economic life after disarmament will help increase opportunities to maintain peace in the Pacific and other regions." Third, the report strongly advocates the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade. It says: "If China and Japan can resume active trade, U.S. financial aid to the two countries can be used very effectively. China can sell various raw materials to benefit Japan, and Japan also has various commodities and equipment needed by China." Fourth, the report explains the importance of aid to South Korea and the unity of Japan and South Korea. Undoubtedly, the scope of the Draper Report is more in-depth and broader than the "Strack Report." It is full of strong political implications.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about our views on the Draper Report. Judging from the main points of this report, the U.S. policy of supporting Japan has obviously undergone drastic changes. If the State Department also takes completely the same steps, then the efforts of the United Nations in the war against Japan and the spirit of the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission after the war will be completely in vain. The reparations requested by various countries in the Far East will immediately become nothing if implemented according to this report. Japan only needs to pay 165 million U.S. dollars in cash or use "assets" in the Northeast and Taiwan as compensation, and it can be safe and sound. This is a further step than Strack's anti-reparation theory. This not only violates the "in-kind reparations" spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, but also transfers "returned materials" to be used as reparations, misrepresenting the facts and completely eliminating the political significance of reparations. We do not agree with Strack's anti-reparation theory; we reject the "Draper Report's" non-reparation theory. We believe that it is very inappropriate to unilaterally support Japan before the peace treaty is concluded. The relevant countries in the Far East are feeling anxious about the U.S. policy of solely controlling Japan. If the U.S. government takes the "Draper Report" as the center of its policy toward Japan in the future, the countries in the Far East will turn from anxiety to fear. The reason why the countries in the Far East are unanimously attacking this report now is based on this cautionary psychology.</p>
<p>In short, the reparations, industrial level, and trade issues suggested in the "Draper Report" are mostly unreasonable opinions. It is more unreasonable than the suggestions in the Strack Report. Therefore, there have been rumors recently that the U.S. State Department will reject this report. We believe that most American politicians and diplomats are wise and decisive, and they will not easily adopt such absurd opinions. For the sake of China's own security, and also for the sake of the United States' position in the Far East, we still hope that the U.S. State Department will consider it carefully!</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The Economic Cooperation Administration on the 20th appointed Stillman, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Time Magazine, to lead a group of industrialists and economists to China to investigate construction plans to be funded by U.S. aid. Other representatives are still being sought for the inspection team and will be selected at a later date. This inspection team will make recommendations to ECA Administrator Hoffman on the use of 60 million U.S. dollars in aid. It is reported that the internal guideline is to focus on increasing power equipment in the Shanghai area, building the Yuehan Railway, and developing coal mines along the route. Stillman and his party are expected to depart within two weeks and plan to stay in China for three months. Lai Pu Han, director of the China Aid Department of the ECA, is also scheduled to depart for Shanghai around June 1 to preside over the use of the entire 463 million U.S. dollars in U.S. aid. The purpose of the Stillman inspection team is not to decide on any construction plans, but only to contact Chinese and American personnel, collect information, and provide it to Hoffman for decision-making. In addition, the material aid portion, with a budget of 275 million U.S. dollars, is progressing rapidly. Of this, 75 million U.S. dollars will be used to purchase grain, and shipments to China have already begun.</p>

Ashida said: Chairman Chiang's statement at the end of the war had created a profound impression among the entire Japanese people, but recent contrary remarks in Chinese newspapers have caused unease in Japan. President Chiang's reiteration of this policy at this time is when the Japanese people are most impressed by this policy. The reporter asked whether Japan expects Chinese imports to occupy an important position in the recently announced five-year economic recovery plan. Ashida replied: Even without the five-year plan, Japan would welcome Chinese iron sand, coking coal, industrial waste, and other raw materials. He also said: At the same time, China may also be willing to import certain kinds of industrial products from Japan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that the Japanese government is preparing to re-establish diplomatic relations and free trade immediately after the signing of the peace treaty. Although it is not yet known when the peace treaty will be concluded, Japan must be prepared to restore diplomatic relations and free trade at any time. However, the establishment of consulates in foreign countries to protect the interests of the Japanese people is unlikely to be realized for quite some time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission today began discussing the problem of Japan's post-war industrial water pond in order to instruct MacArthur to implement it. According to responsible sources, the draft instruction is virtually the same as the committee's temporary instruction several months ago, which designated approximately 1,000 factories for compensation. However, the temporary instruction was not implemented, and only a few mother machines were moved. The new instruction is virtually the same as the various suggestions made by the United States a year ago. The new instruction has been discussed in the committee's small groups for a year, but it was not submitted to the plenary meeting for discussion until today. The representatives said that they had consulted their respective governments several months ago, and some representatives are still awaiting replies, asking whether the Japanese industrial level stipulated in the new instruction is lower than that recommended by the US inspection teams after their independent inspection of Japan. Generally speaking, the United States tends to favor a higher level, allowing Japan to retain more mother machines for industrial recovery. The other Pacific allies favor a lower level to ensure that Japan cannot be militarily revived and to delay Japan's commercial recovery, lest Japan's economic recovery endanger the industrial development of their own countries.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] In his speech at the Labor Party's annual conference today, Foreign Secretary Bevin stated that in order to show its sincerity, the Soviet Union should immediately hold a Japanese peace conference with all related countries, and should not insist that the task of drafting the Japanese peace treaty can only be undertaken by the four powers. Bevin said that there is currently a test of whether it is sincere or not, that is, whether the Soviet Union, Britain, and other countries immediately agree to hold a Japanese peace treaty conference with fourteen or fifteen related countries, believing that then the Far East problem can be resolved. This is an extremely important matter. The fourteen or fifteen countries referred to by Bevin are probably the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission plus Pakistan, South Africa, Myanmar, and so on.</p>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Although the local newspapers have disclosed the full text of the new president's inaugural speech in China regarding the policy toward Japan, none of them have made criticisms. However, several newspapers simultaneously published a United Press International news report from Washington stating that China will require the following in the Japanese peace treaty: (1) Abolish the emperor system; (2) Organize an international police force to supervise the implementation of the Japanese peace treaty; (3) China should receive half of the total amount of Japanese reparations; (4) Ban Japan from rebuilding the metal industry, chemical industry, etc.; (5) Japanese territory should be limited to Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido; (6) Return the Ryukyu Islands to China; (7) Restrict the export of raw materials that can be used for military industries to Japan. The last paragraph of the news report stated that such demands have been opposed by the United States and Western European countries from the perspective of restoring Japanese industry and international trade. However, the US occupation authorities will consider various opinions on the Japanese peace treaty before the Japanese peace treaty is concluded.</p>

<p>Considering Banning Communists from Holding Public Office</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida announced in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that Japan may ban communists from holding public office. This statement was released on the same day as the news that the US House of Representatives passed the anti-communist bill. According to the new Japanese constitution, communists are not prohibited from holding public office. The Japanese government is currently considering this matter, but no decision has been made. Observers speculate that Ashida may be attempting to advance in line with the US anti-communist policy and secretly show foreign investors that as long as he is the prime minister, he will keep the government free of communists. Ashida also announced to the Foreign Affairs Committee at the same time that Japan is prepared to resume diplomatic relations with other countries immediately after the establishment of the peace treaty.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Saigon, 21st] The three-celebrity conference in Vietnam was held here and elected Nguyen Van Xuan as the chairman of the Vietnamese Provisional Central Government. The candidate for chairman was originally decided in Hong Kong, so today's election was purely formal, and the result was expected by all parties. The ancient royal city of Hue has been selected as the future capital of the central government, but in order to appease special elements, central government offices will be established in Saigon and Hanoi. The provisional government of southern Vietnam will be replaced by an administrative committee.</p>
<p>Bao Dai's Restoration; Rumors Rampant</p>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 20th] The new provisional government of Vietnam has been established, with the pro-French Nguyen Van Xuan set to become the prime minister. The new government's announcement calling Annam's deposed King Bao Dai "Your Majesty" has made the rumors that Bao Dai will be restored to the throne even more credible. The new government is opposed to the Republic of Vietnam led by Ho Chi Minh, and Ho's troops have been fighting the French army for two years.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 21st] It was recently reported by Vietnamese republican sources that the Chinese government will conduct informal contacts with Ho Chi Minh's Republic of Vietnam. Ho's representative, Nguyen, has arrived in Nanning and is en route to Nanjing. Nguyen denied the claim that the Vietnamese Republican Army participated in the Chinese Communist Party's disturbances in the Chinese border and hopes that Vietnamese right-wing leader Nguyen Hai Than will cooperate with Ho Chi Minh. Since the French side cannot suppress the Vietnamese army by force, it is urging Annam's deposed King Bao Dai to be restored to the throne.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 21st Radio: Lake Success News, The United Nations Truce Committee, which is currently withdrawing from Jerusalem, today appealed to the Security Council to send neutral troops from the Allied powers to the Holy Land to enforce the Jewish-Arab ceasefire order in the Holy City. The committee warned that otherwise, they would have to let them fight to the end. According to a telegram sent by the committee from Paris, staff members of the committee were injured while inspecting the ceasefire work in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st] The Security Council continued to discuss the US proposal on the 21st to declare that the situation in Palestine has constituted a threat to peace and should take action in accordance with Article 39 of the Charter. Britain has submitted an amendment to this proposal, requesting the deletion of the section "threat to peace" and advocating that the issue of the Security Council imposing sanctions should not be considered. Most other council members have also expressed opposition to the original US proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st] China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided today after a seven-minute meeting to appoint Swedish Red Cross President Bernadotte as the United Nations mediator in Palestine.

<p>Unwilling to Stop Military Aid to Arab Countries</p>
<p>So Oppose the US Proposal in the Security Council</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] London diplomatic sources believe that Britain's unwillingness to support the US resolution in the Security Council, to declare that the situation in Palestine has constituted a state of disruption to peace, is because it is unwilling to stop supplying military aid to Arab countries. And the supply of such military aid is originally Britain's treaty obligation to Egypt, Iraq, and other countries besides Jordan. The British Foreign Office declared two days ago that before being declared illegal by the United Nations, Britain would continue to supply Arab countries with weapons, officers, and funds based on the treaty. If the Security Council passes the US resolution to take action under Article 39 of the Charter, and the Security Council takes military action to stop the war in Palestine, it will inevitably declare Britain's supply of weapons to Arab countries as illegal before taking such action. Diplomatic sources also believe that if the Security Council does not order a ban on the supply of weapons to both sides warring in Palestine, the United States will revoke the arms embargo on the Middle East. The Jews in New York State have already launched a movement to demand the revocation of the ban, and Mrs. Ma Yisheng, the political minister of the Jewish Public Association, has also arrived in Washington to urge the US government to order the lifting of the ban.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Officials recently announced: The families of US military personnel have begun to withdraw in preparation for the possible full withdrawal of the US occupation forces. A spokesperson said that all personnel may leave Korea before August 1. According to statistics, the total number of families of occupation forces personnel is currently 2,310. According to the recommendations of the United Nations, the occupation forces must withdraw within 90 days after the establishment of the new government. This preparation will make the withdrawal of the US military after the formal establishment of the government organized based on the South Korean election on May 10 more smooth. The Communist Party has been chanting the slogan of the US military's withdrawal for a long time. In the open letters exchanged between Wallace and Stalin this week, it was also said that the withdrawal of the occupation forces in Korea can promote world peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 20th] It has been confirmed that Kim Ku, the leader of the Korean independence movement, has retired from political activities and will go to Magok Temple to recuperate.</p>

<p>[United Press International, London, 20th] The American delegation here announced late tonight that the four-power talks on the Austrian treaty between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France have completely collapsed. For two years, the four countries have been discussing the Austrian treaty, but the disputes between the U.S., Britain, and France on one side and the Soviet Union on the other have proved irreconcilable. The talks were recently suspended for two weeks. Until yesterday, the chief representatives of the U.S. and the Soviet Union held private talks to explore whether there was any hope of breaking the deadlock. The Soviet representative stated that he had received instructions from Moscow to insist on Yugoslavia's territorial and compensation claims against Austria, prompting the U.S. to decide to suspend negotiations indefinitely. Yugoslavia is claiming about 800 square miles of territory in the southern Austrian provinces of Carinthia and Styria.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 20th] Haganah announced today that Jewish military aircraft were deployed for the first time, bombing Arab artillery positions and armored vehicle convoys in the Galilee area of the northeast. All aircraft safely returned to base after completing their missions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The entire situation in Palestine may be affected by the major Jewish-Arab battle currently underway in the Galilee Sea area. This marks the first time that Jewish and Arab forces have engaged in direct combat. If the participating Iraqi, Transjordanian, and Syrian forces can achieve a decisive victory in this battle, the Egyptian forces advancing from southern Palestine will be able to launch a full-scale offensive against the main Jewish forces around Tel Aviv. If the Jewish forces can withstand the offensive by the Iraqi, Transjordanian, and Syrian forces, the Egyptian army's willingness to rashly attack the 50,000 Jewish troops concentrated near Tel Aviv will require careful consideration. The offensive by the Arab allied forces south of Galilee, under the cover of aircraft and armored vehicles, is advancing southward to attack Jewish settlements in the Jordan River Valley, with the strategically important city of Beisan in northeastern Palestine as the main target. If Beisan is captured, the prosperous Jewish settlements in the Plain of Armageddon will lose their shield, and the Arab allied forces will be able to join forces with other Transjordanian forces waiting in the Jordan Mountains. The recent situation on other fronts in Palestine is as follows: Southern Front - Egyptian Forces: The Egyptian forces have advanced from Beit Hanoon, north of Gaza, where the Egyptian command is located, in two wings. The left wing has occupied Deir Suneid, ten miles north of Gaza, and the right wing has occupied Beersheba, a major southern city on the road to Jerusalem. Northeastern Front - Syrian Forces: After occupying Samakh, at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee, the Syrian forces have advanced further south, occupying a Western Jewish village three miles away. Eastern Front: Jewish forces are advancing in a fan-shaped formation north from Allenby Bridge to confront the Iraqi and Transjordanian forces. Northern Front: There have been no reports of advances by the Lebanese forces.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 21st Broadcast: Eighty percent of the Old City of Jerusalem has been occupied by Arab forces. The fighting is nearing its end, and the Arab forces are currently launching a fierce assault on the last Jewish strongholds.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Correspondent with Troops in the Holy City, 21st] Arab forces stated on the 21st that the Arab forces that broke through the Old City of Jerusalem have already occupied the Zion Gate, trapping the 4,000 Jewish troops within the Old City without any hope of rescue. The Jewish forces have sent an urgent telegram to Tel Aviv requesting assistance, stating that they will be forced to surrender unless reinforcements arrive immediately. This message has been intercepted by the Arab forces. The battle for the Holy City is only taking place within the Old City.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The Arab forces have issued a final ultimatum to the Jewish forces trapped in the Old City, demanding surrender by the afternoon of the 21st. A Jewish communique stated that fighting continues within the Old City of Jerusalem, while at the same time, Transjordanian forces have positioned their artillery and are threatening a full-scale attack if the Jewish forces refuse to surrender. It is reported that neutral consuls in Jerusalem have urgently telegraphed the King of Transjordan and Tel Aviv, appealing for the preservation of the Holy Land. It is generally believed that only a direct telegram from Truman to Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok, ordering the Jewish forces to accept the Arab forces' final ultimatum, can avert the disaster befalling the Holy Sites.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] More than 300,000 Republican voters in Oregon (the largest number ever registered in the state's history) voted today in the Republican primary to choose between Dewey and Stassen. The Oregon Republican primary will be the last major political battle before the Republican National Convention, scheduled to be held in Philadelphia on June 21st. Both sides are trying to win Oregon's delegation of twelve representatives who will vote at the Republican National Convention. In other words, either Dewey or Stassen will win all twelve delegates, or neither will win any. There has never been such an intense campaign in Oregon's history. Both candidates have traveled thousands of miles by plane and car, and have visited most of the cities and towns in Oregon. These places have never before seen a visit from a presidential candidate. The winner of today's primary will undoubtedly increase their chances of winning at the National Convention.</p>
<h3 id="e64">X-Ray Telescope Magnifies Brightness 500 Times; Can See Heart's Activity <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 20th] The Christian Hauck Institute announced today that 32-year-old physicist Courtland has discovered an X-ray telescope that guides X-rays into the human body, projecting an X-ray image onto a fluorescent screen that is 500 times brighter than current ones, allowing doctors to see the internal organs of the human body in detail. Dr. Chamberlain, the original designer, believes that this will make it easier to quickly locate cancer and tuberculosis, study heart activity, and diagnose kidney disease early. This X-ray device is called a telescope because it can magnify brightness. After passing through the human body, the X-rays are converged by a mirror tube and converted into electrons, which strike the fluorescent screen at a speed of 5,000 miles per second, producing a bright image. The images produced by current X-rays are only one-30,000th as bright as white paper under ordinary light, and hundreds of photos must be taken to show the activity of organs. The new mirror tube can see objects down to 5,000th of an inch. Although the method of increasing brightness by 500 times has been invented, it will still take several months to actually manufacture the mirror tube. Currently, only brightness can be increased by five times. Once realized, the exposure time for the human body and the observation time for doctors can be shortened to avoid harming the human body and reduce the inconvenience of doctors peeping in the dark. In addition, it may be possible to see three-dimensional images, and to transmit them electronically, so that experts in distant places can easily make diagnoses based on them.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] One hundred and three theaters in Shanghai recently jointly appealed to the authorities, requesting that they be given effective protection because they could not stand the disturbances of illegal elements, their venues were repeatedly vandalized, and even their employees were often beaten to death or injured. According to Zhou Jianchou, chairman of the Theatrical Industry Association, the business tax, stamp tax, and entertainment tax collected on behalf of the government that Shanghai theaters pay each month are quite substantial, and they believe that it is unfair to only have the obligation to pay taxes without the right to be protected. The association has now resolved that the tax payments that each theater should pay to the Bureau of Finance on the 23rd of each month will be temporarily deposited in the Shanghai Municipal Bank starting this month, and that they do not intend to transfer the payments to the Bureau of Finance until effective protection measures are obtained from the authorities. However, they do not consider this to be an act of "tax resistance." Furthermore, if this matter cannot be satisfactorily resolved within the month, the theaters have decided that their next step will be to no longer collect entertainment tax on behalf of the government starting next month, and will use a "non-cooperation" approach as a protest. It is reported that in theaters such as the Tianchan Theater, where reserved seats are sold, there are often dozens of disputes every day because seats are forcibly occupied and ticket holders cannot enter temporarily. In addition, in some small theaters that can only accommodate 400 spectators, those watching free shows often occupy as many as 300 seats, and if they are slightly dissatisfied, beatings ensue, and the theater can become a battlefield.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Municipal Council authorities stated that they deeply sympathize with the industry's current difficult situation and intend to seek a reasonable solution to improve the business environment of the theaters, but they believe that the measure of suspending tax payments is inappropriate.</p>

Therefore, it was decided that after the three civilian villages planned to be built by the Municipal Relief Association are completed, the Bureau of Land Administration will survey any remaining land, and then the Bureau of Public Works will design and build houses.

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The payment of enlistment settlement fees in this city began to be issued by the Conscription Service Association the day before yesterday.

The checks issued must be signed by the new recruit himself before they can be cashed. If they are lost, they can be reported to the Municipal Bank. Furthermore, in order to prevent new recruits from gambling, issuing checks is better than issuing cash. This decision was based on the experience of last year's handling. The best thing is that it can avoid accidental harassment and numerical errors, and new recruits can get real benefits. As for the lack of comfort items, it is because there is no such expenditure in this year's meeting and it has not yet been handled.</p>

When the bad news came, the Kirk family was heartbroken and decided to leave an eternal memory for their only son in the most appropriate way. After the Japanese enemy surrendered, Mrs. Kirk, with her son always thinking about the Xu family before his death, immediately wrote to Xu Guifu, asking him to send Xu to the United States for further study, and they were willing to fund all educational expenses. However, due to passport application procedures, it took years without results.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] To celebrate the inauguration of the first President and Vice President under the Constitution, the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters held a garden party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Youth Movement Committee, hosting leaders from all sectors and cadres from all levels of party organizations. Over 800 guests attended, along with several hundred middle and elementary school students. The garden was filled with bright sunshine, and the United Nations flags suspended throughout the area fluttered in the breeze, creating a lively atmosphere and an unprecedented spectacle.</p>
<p>The garden party began with the sound of music. Fang Zhi delivered a speech as the host, stating: "From beginning to end, the Kuomintang has held the determination to return power to the people, because our party cannot always be Zhuge Liang. We must enable our 450 million A'dous to stand on their own two feet as soon as possible. However, on the other hand, the responsibility we bear for the country in the future is even greater, and each of our comrades should work harder to complete this important task of nation-building. This is what each of our comrades should currently recognize. Today, in the celebration of the inauguration of the President and Vice President, I have three additional points to offer for our common encouragement and practice."</p>
<p>Fang Zhi Offers Three Points of Advice</p>
<p>"First, we must fight for our ideology. We have all seen that in yesterday's inaugural address, the President repeatedly mentioned the three major issues of reforming politics, stabilizing the economy, and stabilizing society. All loyal comrades of our party must strive to realize the President's great call to reform politics, stabilize the economy, and stabilize society. Second, we must fight for the people. The foundation of our party lies in the people. Party members must stand on the side of the people, speak for the people, relieve the suffering of the people, seek the welfare of the people, and serve the people and fight for the people at all times and in all places. Third, we must fight for the government. You must know that our government was created with great difficulty, through the bloodshed, sweat, and sacrifice of the party members and the people of the whole country. The current government is the people's government, supported by all the people of the country. Therefore, the comrades of our party must support the constitutional government, actively promote government orders, assist in construction, strengthen the work of suppressing rebellions and bandits, unite as one, and be loyal and brave to fight for the government."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Yuan Shiyong and Zhu Kezhe falsely accusing innocent people of being bandits was previously transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Qi Zhaowu summoned the defendants for questioning and then returned them to custody. Zhang Baogen had gone to work in England after the Anti-Japanese War, and his wife was at home. Yuan Shiyong seduced her into adultery, and they lived together for five years. When Zhang returned to the country after the victory, Zhang's wife returned to Zhang's home, which made Yuan quite unhappy. At the same time, Yuan had a friend, Zhu Shipu, who had a feud with Huang Zhongzhi, the owner of the Yongda Salt Store in this city, due to business relations. Yuan then falsely used Zhu Shipu's name to report to the Garrison Headquarters, which was submitted by Wang Kezhe. It alleged that Huang Zhongzhi had participated in the work of the puppet government's secret service during the enemy puppet period and had recently colluded with the bandit Ding Xishan, often providing materials to the bandits, and that Zhang Baogen was his henchman, and the salt stored in his store came from the bandit area. After investigation by the Garrison Headquarters, it was learned that it was a malicious accusation, and Yuan Shiyong and Wang Kezhe were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office and detained in the Sinan Road detention center.</p>

As for Xian rice, the Shanghai market price was 5.9 million yuan for Yangxian and 5.6 million yuan for Duxian. The Hankou market price on the 20th was 6.2 million yuan.

However, the import quota for wool for the fourth, fifth, and sixth quarters is only US$2 million per quarter, which is 15% of the actual demand. In the past, although the situation of the wool textile industry was difficult, it was still able to utilize some black market wool. However, the situation is different now, and the number of smuggled wool has been drastically reduced, and it is not easy to purchase even at high prices. Some manufacturers have gone to western Zhejiang and Shandong to purchase domestic wool, but the quality and quantity are problematic. Existing factories have been forced to reduce prices due to the lack of wool raw materials.</p>

The first installment should be 50%, and the second installment should be settled 30 days later, or settled when the goods arrive. Please issue the permits for the third quarter before the end of May. (2) For the fifth quarter, the quota for factories should still be settled at 50% of the value of the goods at the then-current exchange rate when the permit is issued, and the remainder should be settled at the exchange rate at the time the goods arrive at the port. (2) In case the government must adopt a guarantee method, please use a bank guarantee instead of a cash guarantee. It is heard that the authorities of the National Bank and the Foreign Exchange Control Committee expressed sympathy for the suggestions and promised to decide on a proper solution after further discussions.</p>

<p>— Ji Xianlin</p>
<p>This is indeed a "big topic," but I can only "make it small." The influence of Buddhism on Neo-Confucianism in the Song Dynasty is significant; this has almost become a universally recognized fact, and no historian of philosophy would deny it anymore. However, almost all the attention is focused on the influence in terms of thought. Mr. Feng Zhisheng (Youlan), in his "A History of Chinese Philosophy, Volume Two," twelfth chapter (page 800), discusses the thoughts of Han Yu and Li Ao, concluding:</p>
<p>"From what has been said above, the foundation and outline of Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism were established in the Tang Dynasty by Han Yu and Li Ao; and Li's contribution is even greater than Han's, and the influence of Buddhism on his doctrines is even more evident." Xie Wuliang, in his "A History of Chinese Philosophy, Third Part, Volume One," page one, also says:</p>
<p>"The great Confucian scholars of the Song Dynasty often interacted with Buddhist monks, and their discussions on the nature of life and destiny were bound to find common ground; only in matters of human affairs and ethics did they hold different views." Both are talking about the influence of Buddhism on Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism in terms of thought. Jiang Weiqiao and Yang Daying, in their "An Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy, Volume Two," page four, say:</p>
<p>"Scholars have always said that the deep relationship between Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism and Buddhism lies in their fundamental ideas, but we believe it lies only in their methods. The similarity in methods leads to some superficial resemblances; in reality, the two schools of thought, one being a worldly philosophy and the other a transcendent philosophy, are fundamentally incompatible."</p>
<p>I do not understand what he means by "methods." Furthermore, numerous scholars, both Chinese and foreign, have discussed the relationship between Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism, almost always focusing on the relationship between the two schools of thought from a broad perspective. I cannot list them all here.</p>
<p>In this short essay, I cannot, and dare not, discuss the major issues of thought. I only want to point out a small matter that seems to have gone unnoticed in the past, to draw everyone's attention. Chinese Neo-Confucian scholars, in addition to discussing philosophical issues, mostly practiced a certain amount of self-cultivation, and one of these practices was to conquer selfish desires. In the "Selected Sayings on Learning Regulations" by Yin Mingshou of the Qing Dynasty, Volume One, "Ways to Enter Virtue," in the section called "Conquering and Rectifying," he quotes Zhu Xi as saying:</p>
<p>"Zhu Xi said: 'Those who wished to purify their thoughts in the past would place two containers in their sitting place. Every time a good thought arose, they would throw a white bean into one container; every time a bad thought arose, they would throw a black bean into the other container. At first, there would be many black beans and few white beans, but later there would be no more black beans, and finally, there would be no more white beans either. However, this is just a rigid method. If one were to add the effort of reading and investigating principles, then it would be easy to get rid of those improper thoughts.'"</p>
<p>I do not know how many people actually practiced this method, but I remember seeing Neo-Confucian scholars practicing this method in other books, which shows that there were quite a few who practiced it. When we first see this method, probably no one would think that this is not a "domestic product." I also initially thought that only China, and only Chinese Neo-Confucian scholars, could have invented this comical and clumsy "rigid method." But later I actually found its origin in the Chinese Tripitaka. In the tenth chapter of the "Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish," (67) "Chapter Sixty: Upagupta," there is a story about Ananda's disciple Yequian Datuo, who upheld the Buddhist Dharma. He heard that a certain layman had a child, so he went to ask the layman for the child, "wanting him to enter the Way." The layman refused. Later, he had another child, and he still refused to let him become a monk.</p>
<p>"This Yequian Datuo was an Arhat, possessing the three clarities, able to know the roots of people. Seeing that these two children had no affinity with the Way, he stopped his intention and did not diligently ask. Later, that layman had another son, whose face was beautiful and whose appearance was extraordinary. Then Yequian Datuo went again to ask for him. The layman said: 'The child is still young and cannot serve yet, and the family is poor and cannot afford to send him gifts. Let's wait and give him to you when he is older.' As he grew older, his talent and ability increased. His father entrusted him with wealth and had him sell goods in the market. Then Yequian Datuo went to his side and preached the Dharma to him, teaching him to maintain mindfulness, using white and black stones as counters. Place white stones for good thoughts, and black stones for bad thoughts. Upagupta received his teachings, and whenever good or bad thoughts arose, he would throw the stones. At first, there were many black stones and very few white ones. Gradually, through cultivation, the white and black stones became equal. When the bad thoughts ceased, there were no more black stones, only white ones. As good thoughts increased, he attained the first fruit." (Taisho Tripitaka, Volume 4, page 442, bottom)</p>
<p>This method of "maintaining mindfulness" is completely the same as the method used by Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian scholars, except for the slight difference between black and white beans and black and white stones. If Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian scholars had never come into contact with Buddhist scriptures at all, we might still be able to say that this was a coincidence; but in fact, their relationship with Buddhist scriptures was very deep, so we can only say that this was an intentional borrowing. This method, which looks like an authentic Chinese product, was originally transmitted from India along with Buddhism. From this small example, we can see that Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism was not only influenced by Buddhism in terms of major ideas, but also in many minor details that people usually do not pay attention to.

<h3 id="e150">Fundamental Problems in Indian Grammar Theory <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Kemu</p>
<p>To trace the theory, we have to go back before Panini. Although Panini is regarded as an unrivaled ancestor by later generations, he was only the rear guard who compiled previous achievements. According to the custom of circulating Indian texts, once a doctrine accumulates and becomes a fixed form, there is a book that wipes out all the previous levels and replaces all the predecessors as a "Sutra." In this situation, the "Panini Sutra" has become the only surviving book of this type, and there is no way to trace its origin. However, in addition to grammar, ancient India also had etymology, which was one of the "Six Limbs of the Vedas," the orthodox learning. Etymology is the so-called "Nirukta," and there is a book of the same name that still exists today. Although that book, like the "Panini Sutra," does not necessarily belong to the original "Six Limbs of the Vedas," and it is only another incomplete glossary of difficult Vedic words, the so-called "Nighantu," which is a commentary on it, it still preserves a record of the discussion on the fundamental problem of grammar theory. The author of the "Nirukta," Yaska, was before Panini, so this is the oldest extant material on this issue.</p>
<p>In the discussion in the first chapter of "Nirukta," Yaska acknowledges that there are four types of words: nouns, verbs, particles, and interjections. (The term "particle" is translated using Xuanzang's translation in the sixth volume of "Vijnaptimatrata-siddhi," the rest are tentative.) Verbs can be divided into six types: birth, existence, change, increase, decrease, and destruction. But this is the view of one person and one school; only four types of words seem to have been the common opinion at the time. Among the four categories, "particles" and "interjections" naturally do not change themselves, while "nouns" and "verbs" still have to have changes. The changes of these two are the main content of grammar, and the relationship between the two, that is, the problem of the origin of all words, becomes the basic topic of grammatical theory.</p>
<p>Yaska first gives a definition, (Punna edition of 1940, some explanations are based on the commentator Rajavade, the same below.) saying:</p>
<p>"All these [words] are four 'classes of sentences': nouns, verbs, particles, interjections. Among these, nouns and verbs resemble each other. 'Action' is the basis, which is the verb 'likeness'. 'Existence' is the basis, which is the noun 'likeness'. Among these, the two are combined, with 'action' as the basis. The 'action' done before and after is called 'action', which is shown by verbs, [such as] walking and cooking, starting at the beginning and ending at the end. Once fixed as 'existence', it is named [shown] as 'existence', [such as] walking and cooking. 'This' is to show all 'existence' [same likeness]. Cow, horse, person, elephant, [showing different likenesses]. 'Action' [showing] the 'action' [same likeness]. Sitting, lying, walking, standing, [showing different likenesses]." (Chapter 1, Section 1. Words in square brackets are added to the translation, the same below. "Action" is translated according to Kumarajiva's translation of the "Madhyamaka-karika," which is the "actionlessness of the sage" and the "actionlessness of great elegance," which is contrasted with "existence" here. In fact, this word is also "existence" in Chinese, but in Sanskrit, they are two different word roots, with very different meanings. The problem of "existence" is very interesting, and I have another article discussing it. "Same likeness" and "different likeness" could have been translated as "common likeness" and "unique likeness," but I avoid using them here to avoid confusion.)</p>
<p>"Action" and "existence" both refer to being, but the former refers to the process of an action, and the latter refers to the completion of an action. The former observes the movement of change, while the latter views the static state of the whole. Therefore, the former is expressed by "verbs," and the latter is expressed by "nouns." If an action has distinct before and after stages, then it is a movement, and it must be expressed by "verbs." A movement has a beginning and an end. If it is fixed and completed, then it is a thing, not a movement, and it must encompass the whole, expressed by "nouns." The "walking" and "cooking" in the former are verb forms, and the "walking" and "cooking" in the latter are noun forms. "This" is also considered a noun, but it is actually a pronoun, which can replace everything. "Cow and horse" are specific designations. "Action" is also a general name for all actions and behaviors, and "sitting and lying" are used to distinguish them. "Existence" is Being, and "Action" is Becoming, which are two types of existence.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the principle that "verbs come from nouns" and its opposing aspects. Saint Saska said:</p>
<p>"The four 'sentence classes' listed as such are: nouns, verbs, particles, and interjections. Among these, all nouns are produced from verbs, according to Sakatayana and Nighantuka. Not all, according to Gargya and some grammarians." (Chapter 1, Section 12)</p>
<p>To clarify this debate, I will let them speak for themselves in easy modern language. Yaska first records Gargya's reasons for opposing:</p>
<p>"Meaningful words derived from sounds and forms (augmentations) according to grammatical rules, if they are consistent with the meanings derived from the roots, are recognized words. [Roots that do not conform to the meaning of the word cannot be considered the source.] Such as cow, horse, person, elephant. If all "nouns" come from "verbs," then those with the same behavior should have the same names. All those occupying the road should be called horses. All those that can sting should be called grass. If "nouns" come from "verbs," then there should be as many names as there are actions. Then, the pillars should also be called "sleeping holes" (standing in holes) or "tight connections" (supporting beams). Moreover, "nouns" created from actions according to grammar should clearly express their meanings, and the forms of person, horse, and grass should be changed. (Examples omitted.) Moreover, we must carefully consider [words] that are already in common use (recognized). It is said that "earth" is "spread out." Who spreads it out? What supports [the person who spreads it out]? Moreover, words whose meanings do not match, Sakatayana mixes and matches halves from these words and those words. (Examples omitted.) Moreover, everyone says that existence precedes action. It is unreasonable to call something that existed first by a later action. Therefore, this argument is unreasonable." (Chapter 1, Sections 12 and 13)</p>
<p>The reply from the Nirukta school:</p>
<p>"Alas, what are you saying! You say: 'Meaningful words derived from sounds and forms according to grammatical rules, if they are consistent with the meanings derived from the roots, are all words derived from the roots.' According to this, this does not refute [our theory]. For example, you say: 'Those with the same behavior should have the same names.' We see that some people who do the same things have the same names, and some do not. (Examples omitted.) From this argument, your later refutation is also answered. For example, you say: ''Nouns' created from actions according to grammar should clearly express their meanings.' Some words, although derived from only one word and using direct suffixes, are rarely used. (Examples omitted.) For example, you say: 'We must carefully consider [words] that are already in common use (recognized).' [We] originally study the structure of words that are already in common use. You say: 'Earth' is said to be 'spread out.' Who spreads it out? What supports [the person who spreads it out]?' Seeing that it is spread out there, [we call it spread out], even if there is no one else who spreads [it]. According to you, everyone who names things after seeing them should be blamed. For example, you say: 'Someone mixes and matches halves from these words and those words.' It is the one who mixes and matches without regard for the meaning of the words who should be criticized. This is the criticism of that kind of person. For example, you say: 'It is unreasonable to call something that existed first by a later action.' We see that some things that are already born are named after later actions, and some are not. (Examples omitted.)" (Chapter 1, Section 14)</p>
<p>The opposition ultimately failed. The etymologists conquered the grammarians. "Nouns" come from "verbs," and everything is named because of action. This principle became the creed of the grammarians. The "Panini Sutra" takes verb roots as the basis, and "particles" are no longer independent, and "interjections" are only considered "nouns" with dropped endings. Therefore, from the traditional 1,943 verb roots, changing according to 3,996 "sutras," it includes all the phenomena of standard Sanskrit (and even the exceptions of Vedic language).</p>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>The merits and demerits of this grammatical theory, and the causal historical relationship between it and the study of grammar and etymology before and after it, need not be discussed here. What I want to point out is just a little seed of Indian thought lurking in this theory.</p>
<p>"Nouns" come from "verbs," and all roots are verbs. What exists is ultimately the synthesis of action. After the grammatical theorists analyzed the confusing language phenomena layer by layer, based on the sounds actually living in the mouth, they did not obtain abstract concepts, but only obtained the ever-changing behavior. What is static is only the synthesis covering it, or the completion of the action and the inseparable whole. There is no formal, mathematical, or logical thinking, only the analysis and synthesis of concrete phenomena. Movement is divisible, and static is synthesized and indivisible. Taking movement as the foundation, if it develops in the direction of analysis, it can reach the multiple "atoms" that cannot be further divided, etc., or it can be broken again to obtain an extremely impermanent movement, and even go beyond movement. If it develops in the direction of synthesis, it is possible to see permanence above impermanence, and to see the transcendental indivisible in the divisible. Because of seeing movement, we emphasize seeking "quietude." However, no matter how it develops, it starts from the concrete phenomena of movement, not from conceptual, mathematical, or formal logic. Although the philosophical theory of the later so-called grammarians is only in other aspects, from this fundamental problem that was debated in the early stages, we can see a line of thought that is related to the entire Indian thought, and thus is in direct contrast to the starting point under the Western logical concept. As for China, perhaps we can jokingly say that India believes in the mantra of spoken language and the secret signs of finger movements, while Chinese Taoists believe in the talismans of brushstrokes. Perhaps the old Chinese etymology was in the opposite direction of India? (Zheng Qiao mentioned the distinction between emphasizing sound and emphasizing form.)</p>
<p>However, I have already spoken too far. To discuss further would involve too much, and it would be difficult to determine right and wrong, and I would inevitably invite ridicule from experts. So, I will leave this point aside. To know what we often say about verb roots was like at the beginning of the discussion, what kind of system made it possible to become the foundation, and how this system differs from systems based on abstract concepts and logic, may not be without benefit.

<h3 id="e151">Regarding "Wang Tao's Death Year" <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Zeyi</p>
<p>Xu Guangmo's "Wang Tao's Death Year," published in the fifteenth issue of Shen Bao's "Literature and History" weekly, based on the preface of Miao Shaochu's Meishu Yin Cao, contends that Wang Tao died in the winter of the twenty-third year of Guangxu, Ding You. Mr. Hu Shi specifically stated in the editor's postscript that someone had also told him of a similar contention. However, because he had forgotten who made the contention, he hoped that someone would point it out and that the Shen Bao office could check the old newspapers of the time to "make a final conclusion" on Wang Tao's death year. After checking the Shen Bao, there seemed to be no result.</p>
<p>Last September, when Mr. Luo Xianglin came to Nanjing from Guangzhou, he kindly sent me a copy of "Sun Yat-sen's University Days." There were several minor errors in the textual research of the book, such as the section discussing the relationship between Wang Tao and Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which stated:</p>
<p>"Although Wang Tao was known for his deep understanding of foreign affairs in the early years of Guangxu, according to Mr. Chen Shaobai's 'Essential History of the Revive China Society,' it is said that when Sun Yat-sen went to Shanghai in the twentieth year of Guangxu, he met Wang Tao and presented a letter to Li Hongzhang, which Wang Tao helped him revise... According to Chen Guosong's 'The Taiping Scholar Wang Tao' in 'Yi Jing' issue 33, Tao died of illness as early as the sixteenth year of Guangxu. Whether Sun Yat-sen ever met Wang Tao is questionable. It is suspected that another friend, Zhu Bi, whom Sun Yat-sen met at Zheng Guanying's house and introduced to Luo Fenglu in Tianjin, was mistaken for Wang Tao. If so, then the letter to Li Hongzhang has nothing to do with Wang Tao."</p>
<p>I told Mr. Luo that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, and the material cited in the book, which stated that he died in the sixteenth year of Guangxu, was incorrect. Mr. Luo said that the book was written in Chongqing during the war, and it was difficult to collect historical materials in detail. This was the actual situation. At the time, I also told him that Chen Shaobai's account of Wang Tao's revision of Sun Yat-sen's letter to Li Hongzhang was credible and that the facts were so and did not detract from Sun Yat-sen's greatness.</p>
<p>At that time, I said that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, based on Mr. Xiao Yishan's "Register of Writings by Qing Dynasty Scholars" and Wu Jingshan's "A Brief Study of Wang Tao's Deeds" (published in the Republic of China twenty-fifth year edition of "Shanghai Research Materials"), which were materials that Mr. Xu Guangmo and Mr. Hu's friend Roswell S. Britton had not seen. Wu Jingshan compiled a chronicle of Wang Tao's life, stating that he was born on the fourth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the eighth year of Daoguang, Wu Zi, and died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, Ding You, at the age of seventy. He died in April at his Caotang (thatched cottage) west of the city. "According to Yao Wenxuan et al.'s 'Supplementary Shanghai County Records,' volume 30, 'Miscellaneous Records,' Wang Tao 'bought a house in the western city in his later years, naming it Caotang west of the city.'" It can be seen that he died in his Shanghai residence in April of the twenty-third year of Guangxu.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that the Supplementary Shanghai County Records were compiled in the early years of the Republic of China and published in May of the seventh year of the Republic of China, with events "ending completely with the documents of one era from the tenth year of Tongzhi to the third year of Xuantong" (as stated in Wu Xin's preface). The record of Wang Tao in the book is so brief, and the reason why the chief editor mentioned him in the "Miscellaneous Records" at the end of the volume is that he wrote "Ying Huan Zhi Lue in six volumes, which describes the events of Shanghai in great detail." The Wuxian County Records compiled by Cao Yunyuan in the Republic of China also did not mention him, only listing some of his books in volume 57, the literary examination section.</p>
<p>Wu Jingshan recorded the year and month of Wang Tao's death, drawing on "Cai Erkan's Zhutiegang Reading and Writing Jottings Manuscript," which is a rare and valuable historical material. The author of the manuscript was a native of Shanghai with good Chinese and Western literacy. Most of the publications of the early Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge in China were translated by him, often under the name "Lou Shu Xian Shi Cai Erkan," who was a famous writer in Shanghai. In the first year of Guangxu, Shen Bao imitated the Jujin edition and published Wang Tao's "Weng Guan Yu Tan" (eight volumes), and Cai Erkan wrote a long preface for him, showing their deep friendship between the lines. Therefore, what he said about the year and month of Wang Tao's death must be extremely reliable.</p>
<p>According to the above, Wang Tao's birth year was the fourth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the eighth year of Daoguang, which is November 10, 1828 in the Western calendar. This is consistent with Roswell S. Britton's record in Arthur W. Hummel's "Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period" (Ibld., 11, P. 836). As for the year of death, it is also consistent with Mr. Xu Guangmo's contention based on the preface of Meishu Yin Cao that he died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, Ding You, which should be no problem. However, the months are different, one in the summer (April) and one in the winter. Although the sources of these two claims are both from Wang Tao's friends, one of them must be wrong. I would like to tell Mr. Xu about the results of this research and hope to conduct further discussions.</p>
<p>(March 28th, 37th year, Nanjing).</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>In the fifteenth issue of this journal, Xu Guangmo's article "Wang Tao's Death Year" was published. At that time, I wrote a postscript, saying that I had heard in Shanghai the year before last that someone had determined that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, at the age of seventy, and had recorded the results of this research in a world chronology, but had not noted the source or who had determined it. Therefore, I very much hoped that someone would point out the source and basis of this claim and make a final conclusion on Wang Tao's death year. Later, while traveling in the South, I received articles from Mr. Zhang Tiansong, Tan Zhengfeng, and Peng Zeyi, all of whom pointed out that the first person to determine Wang Tao's birth and death was Mr. Wu Jingshan's "A Brief Study of Wang Tao's Deeds," published in "Shanghai Research Materials." Now, Mr. Peng's article is published here, and I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Tan Zhengfeng and Zhang Tiansong.</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Spirit of Shang Yang <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>Recently, an employee of a cooperative (？) in a domestic government agency was sentenced to life imprisonment according to law for embezzling three tubes of toothpaste and one shirt, with a value approaching "more than 1,000 yuan" for the crime of "embezzlement".</p>
<p>Many people believe that this is adhering to the old laws of ten years ago and that it is somewhat "excessive" in terms of human sentiment.</p>
<p>But I don't think it's indefensible. The spirit of the rule of law is "trust". In order to gain the trust of the people, Shang Yang practiced the implementation of a heavy reward of one thousand gold for the people's movement of a stick to show the strictness of the unwritten law. Similarly, it is overcorrection, but in a country that is not accustomed to the rule of law, and wants to implement the rule of law strictly, it is indeed necessary to do a few things that are overcorrected and not close to human sentiment to show the rigidity and inviolability of the spirit of the rule of law and to show the iron fist for both big and small matters, so as to achieve the propaganda effect of reforming the stubborn and establishing the timid.</p>
<p>Therefore, although we sympathize with the misfortune of this toothpaste and shirt embezzler, we also feel that if it has the effect of thoroughly arousing the spirit of the rule of law, it is not necessarily a joyful thing, and it is not necessary to feel sorry for one or two people.</p>
<p>However, the spirit of Shang Yang cannot be imitated without reservation. For example, "The crown prince commits a crime, and his teacher is punished" was considered to be an incredible impartiality at the time, but even today, it still means "the noble is not punished," and to the extreme, it is still not exempt from punishing those who steal hooks, while those who steal countries are still lords. And for the need to strictly implement the rule of law in China today - punishing corruption is exactly what is taboo, a slight difference, and it will often be wrong by a thousand miles, inevitably receiving the opposite effect. Showing that one does not dare to touch the tiger's whiskers is to help the tiger grow its power. "Killing the chicken to scare the monkey" is okay, but scaring the tiger is not.</p>
<h3 id="e153">I Also Talk About Shi Zhaoji <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>A few days ago, Ling Xiaohan, the owner of the pavilion, talked about the old diplomat Shi Zhaoji. Shi's style in the diplomatic circle is different from others. Taking this opportunity, I will talk about Shi's brief history in the diplomatic circle.</p>
<p>In modern times, Zhejiang has a great number of talents in the diplomatic circle, such as Wang Daxie, Sun Baoqi, Hu Weide, Shen Ruilin, Huang Fu, Shi Zhaoji, Wang Zhengting, etc., who are the best of the best.</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji, alias Zhi Zhi, is a native of Hangxian, Zhejiang, and is currently 69 years old. He is the son of Shi Zejing, a former Qing scholar. After graduating from St. John's University in Shanghai, he went to the United States to study, first entering Washington High School, and then Cornell University. He studied in the United States for ten years and obtained a master's degree. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, he returned to China and served as the foreign affairs secretary of Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Huguang. The following year, he served as the supervisor of students studying in the United States and went to the United States. Soon after, he served as the first-class counselor to the minister for inspecting the political affairs of various countries. At that time, the Qing court was sending Zaize, Dai Hongci, Xu Shichang, Duanfang, Shaoying, etc., to various countries in the East and West to inspect the constitution. Soon after, Shi returned to China and successively served as Wang Shi of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, Chief Supervisor of the Jinghan Railway, and Binjiang Customs Daotai. In the third year of Xuantong, he was transferred to the post of Jilin Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and Zuo You Cheng of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Soon after, he was appointed as the ambassador to the United States, Mexico, Peru, and Cuba, but he did not go abroad because of the Wuchang Uprising in the autumn of the Xinhai year.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, Tang Shaoyi served as the first prime minister of the cabinet, and he served as the Minister of Transportation. However, because most of the officials in the ministry were old officials from the Ministry of Posts and Communications, he was unable to control them and had to resign and was transferred to the post of Grand Master of Ceremonies of the Presidential Palace. In June of the third year of the Republic of China, he was appointed as the ambassador to the United Kingdom, where he served for more than six years. In October of the ninth year of the Republic, he was transferred to the post of ambassador to the United States. In January of the twelfth year of the Republic, Zhang Shaozeng promoted the policy of peaceful reunification and proposed that Shi serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Because he did not receive the approval of the National Assembly, he did not take office and was replaced by Huang Fu. After a while, Zhang's cabinet thought about overthrowing Li Yuanhong because of the Tianjin and Baoding factions, saying that there were still members of the Li faction in Zhang's cabinet, and advocated overthrowing Zhang's cabinet. Therefore, Zhang's cabinet fell after a short time. Due to the political turmoil, Shi once again served as the ambassador to the United States. In the fourteenth year of the Republic, he served as the plenipotentiary representative of the Tariff Conference. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Zhili faction restored its power, and Yan Huiqing served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and also acted as the President of the Republic. Shi was once appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but he did not take office. When the National Government was established, he took office as the ambassador to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>When the "September 18th" Incident in Shenyang occurred, the Japanese seized the Northeast, and our country appealed to the League of Nations. He served as the representative of our country to the League of Nations, accusing Japan of occupying the Northeast. It is a violation of international law and infringes upon Chinese sovereignty. Please ask the member states to advocate justice and provide assistance, which has won international sympathy.</p>
<p>In October of the twentieth year of the Republic, the government appointed him as the Minister of Foreign Affairs again, but he did not take office. In January of the twenty-second year, he was appointed as the ambassador to the United States, and in the twenty-fourth year, he was promoted to the ambassador plenipotentiary to the United States. He resigned in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, and Wang Zhengting succeeded him.</p>
<p>In summary, he spent the most time as a diplomat in the United Kingdom and the United States, and he did not take office for several times as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in China. Comparatively speaking, it can be said that he was both fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>He is very honest and belongs to the steady faction. He does not take risks or claim credit. He is the kind of person who is down-to-earth.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Regarding "Loving Mother" <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Xin</p>
<p>It is common in the world to use "strict father" and "loving mother" as different names for parents, such as "my late father" and "your esteemed mother". There is no objection to the former, but the term "loving mother" is not actually referring to the legal wife or biological mother. Gu Tinglin's Daily Knowledge Records, Volume 5, item "Loving Mother Like Mother" says: "What is a loving mother? When the child is young and the mother dies, the child is raised by the father's concubine. When the father dies, the child mourns for three years to repay the kindness of raising him." The reason why a loving mother mourns for the legal son is because of the labor of raising and nurturing him, so the mourning should be "like a mother", and the mourning must be ordered by the father and cannot be decided by himself. Secondly, Wang Renqiu's "Stories with Xiang" says: "The mother of Prince Gongzhong was the loving mother of Emperor Wenzong (Xianfeng). Empress Dowager Quan entrusted her to Concubine Kangci, and Concubine Kangci gave up her son to breastfeed Emperor Wenzong, so she was like a close sibling with the Prince." The term "loving mother" originally had practical content, but the reason why the world uses "loving" to replace "mother" may be because women are often kind and amiable. However, in Li Lingbo's (Mi) "Memorial of Emotions," there is a phrase "Six months after giving birth to a child, the loving father passed away," then the word "loving" can still be used for the father, which is the opposite of "strict father". Could it be that Li's father was also not his biological father? In my opinion, based on the long-standing habit of today, it may be okay to use a single word "loving" (such as "your late loving mother"), but it would be wrong to directly replace the legal wife or biological mother with "loving mother".</p>
<h3 id="e155">West Point's New Style <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Jiu Jiu</p>
<p>First, let me give a note: This "West Point" is the United States Military Academy, the oldest military academy in the United States, not the "West Point" of "cream West Point".</p>
<p>World War II caused a major revolution in strategy and tactics, so West Point, which is responsible for training army cadres, has adopted a completely new teaching method. The American army will soon undergo a complete transformation, sweeping away the habits of old-fashioned soldiers and becoming a stronger, more scientific, and more down-to-earth team.</p>
<p>For example, in World War II, many young officers with higher education often commanded combat in a gentle, easy, and extremely firm and brave tone, unlike old-fashioned officers who shouted, "An order is an order, and soldiers should only obey!" But in fact, those young officers were often able to win the love of their soldiers, while those old-fashioned officers who specialized in putting on airs were often complained about in the troops, greatly reducing efficiency. The American military authorities are very clear about this situation, so West Point's education method has also taken a new direction.</p>
<p>In the past, West Point's upperclassmen could order around underclassmen, almost as if they were servants. Now, this tradition of more than 140 years has been completely broken. The entire military education at West Point has abandoned the formalistic style of the past. West Point Superintendent Taylor said: "We will not tolerate those who are unqualified among our officers. The task of our soldiers is becoming more and more difficult year by year. The officers we need must be first-class leaders; more importantly, they must have a deep understanding of human nature and be good at dealing with personnel problems. We are now going to train this kind of officer."</p>
<p>In the eyes of old-fashioned officers, this is completely nonsense. They only know how to work hard - at the expense of gaining a reputation for being arbitrary and self-willed in order to maintain their prestige. But times have changed, and there is no place for old diehards. West Point's most important subject right now is "Military Leadership Psychology." The instructors responsible for teaching this subject clearly tell the students: In battle, no matter who it is, there is always some fear in their hearts. At this time, the commander must try to suppress his own fear and deal with it calmly; if he can give the soldiers something to do, he can reduce some of their fear.</p>
<p>The instructor repeatedly urged his students that when issuing orders, the wording must be precise, and there must be absolutely no ambiguity, exaggeration, or impatience.</p>
<p>Once in class, the instructor asked a question and asked the students to answer. The question was: If you are a battalion commander, several important people are coming to visit your stationed position, and maybe they will inspect it. And one of the soldiers in your battalion, named Harris, is usually willing to work hard, but whenever he is inspected, he is always overly nervous and his steps cannot be uniform. Now, you need to find a way to keep Harris from participating in this inspection, but also save his face. How should you deal with it?</p>
<p>Then, he assigned a student to be the battalion commander, and he himself played Harris. He said: "Suppose you are the battalion commander and just called me in - start now."</p>
<p>The "battalion commander" hesitated for a long time and said: "Tell you - about this inspection - the regimental commander said that you can be exempted from participating. Anyway, several trucks will also be assembled for inspection, so you can sit in the truck and take a look."</p>
<p>Then there was a discussion. The students expressed great dissatisfaction with this "battalion commander". According to his method, first, Harris's mood must not be happy, and second, it is not smart to push the responsibility for not wanting Harris to participate onto the regimental commander.</p>
<p>The second "battalion commander" was different. He first said to Harris, "Please sit down," and then gave him a cigarette. Then he sincerely said: "Harris, you probably already know that several important people are coming tomorrow. I am now assigning you to be their adjutant and represent our troops to entertain them. This is an honor, and I think I don't need to say more. When they inspect, you will be by their side. I believe you will give them a good impression."</p>
<p>This method was immediately praised by everyone.</p>
<p>Do you say that it is not worth the effort to work on these minor details? When you are in danger, you will know how important these "Harrises" are! Most of West Point's 2,000 students have experienced battles in World War II, and they unanimously believe that this education of "winning the love of soldiers" is the most valuable subject!</p>

<p>— San Mu</p>
<p>Singing at the Summit of the Misty Peak</p>
<p>In the past, climbing and visiting cost a lot of candle wax, and I always hated that mountains and waters were difficult to combine. The Yandang Mountain Xiangyan Lake is truly amazing, and the Taiwan Sun Moon Lake is also described. Is it possible to use mountains and waters as a means? As if making a cup from the flexible willow. Stone Man Mountain is like a towering hungry tiger, with a peak rising straight into the clouds. Braving thorns and new thorns, passing through the steep slope, I tried to imitate the snake's winding body. Pressing my eyebrows and lowering my head for more than a hundred steps, suddenly my breath was clear to the blue sky. The chaotic rocks are densely arranged and steep, the strong wind shakes the stone, and the thunder roars. People are like mice lying down, and the stone people stand. At this time, the wonderful fun is hard to express. Looking up at the primordial chaos, and looking down at the universe, the vast smoke fills the air. The lake waves are thirty-six thousand acres, rippling and swirling around each other. Seventy-two peaks are all crawling, like lying dragons and crouching toads. A touch of distant green connects the sky, and the sails are clearly arranged like stars. Climbing high and enjoying the scenery is enough to satisfy, and sitting down, I regret the past years of barren travel. Now the armor is full of heaven and earth, and the world looks to the empty clouds and mountains. Is this question suitable for a place to avoid Qin? People say that the hidden grass is deep in the dust! Alas! I want to return now, but I can't return. Even if I return, I am afraid that there will be many mistakes. The Lingwei Sushu cannot be seen, and there is no way to dry the hot tears of mourning.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Automobiles in Germany <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Lianshi</p>
<p>Selling and buying cars is a business that is easy to make money in Germany. In Berlin, some American officials often sell their own cars because they are ordered to return home soon, which is inconvenient to carry on the journey, and they often get unexpected income.</p>
<p>An American military interpreter bought a light American-style car for 1,500 yuan (US dollars) six months ago. During these six months, the car traveled about 10,000 miles for him. Now that he is about to return home, he decided to sell the car, and as a result, it was sold for 2,350 yuan. Not only did he ride 10,000 miles for free, but he also made 850 yuan.</p>
<p>An American liaison officer bought a large bus for 2,200 yuan a year ago. During this year, he traveled 30,000 miles. When he sold it a month ago, in addition to the capital of 2,200 yuan, he also made a profit of 1,550 yuan.</p>
<p>An American sergeant bought a 1939 two-door light car (made in Germany) for 375 yuan six months ago, but now he sold it for 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>When the war ended, there was a strange story of "Cigarette Automobile" in Germany. At that time, 50 boxes of American cigarettes could be exchanged for a streamlined light car.</p>
<p>Recently, the US military authorities, in view of the serious shortage of German cars, have implemented a strategy of importing a large number of American cars. At the same time, it is strictly forbidden for US military officers and soldiers to sell cars, and it is forbidden for returning US military personnel to obtain undue profits when selling their own cars. If a returning US military personnel sells his own car and makes a profit of more than 1,200 yuan, if it is found out, he will be fined to return all the profits to the owner of the car.</p>
<p>An American second lieutenant named Johnson was one who had bad luck. Before returning home, he sold his own car and made a profit of 1,500 yuan, which exceeded the limit stipulated by the authorities. As a result, he was investigated and had to return 1,500 yuan in full to the buyer of the car in accordance with the law. Since the law was enacted, he was the first person to be punished.</p>

<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>The popularity of checks did not start today, but it is most popular today. Just look at the so-called upper class, which person's pocket does not have a checkbook?</p>
<p>Ask the merchants, they are very welcome to creditworthy checks, because that can reduce a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>So the bank invented traveler's checks because of this, and the post office imitated it, and as a result, drafts, bank drafts, and checks are simply three in one, and it is much more convenient to use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the banknotes and stamps we use have not adopted the check-style blank, otherwise, wouldn't it be more labor-saving to fill in them as you use them?</p>
<h3 id="e159">Supplement to the Old People of this Newspaper <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The previous article recorded the old people of this newspaper in the past, but there are still some pearls left behind. Now I will collect them again to supplement the talk.</p>
<p>Liu Shipei from Yizheng, Jiangsu, alias Shenshu, flaunted national studies, recited the revolution, and once founded the National Studies Preservation Association in Shanghai with Huang Huiwen, Deng Dimei, and others, publishing the National Essence Journal. Shenshu lived in the association and also served as the pen government of this newspaper. He had a broken old bus to travel back and forth, writing an essay every day without signing his name. What he discussed was to the point, and people spread it widely. Jin Jianhua, alias Yongliu, was good at writing lyrics and served as the pen government of this newspaper for a long time. It is said that he is still alive today. Sun Dongwu and I were friends of the year. He was thin and long, spoke the light Wu dialect, and traveled all over the north and south of the Yangtze River. He was in charge of the editorial of this newspaper, writing fluently and freely, relying on the horse to wait. He was versed in old learning, and his words were carefully considered, and his writing was particularly elegant and readable. He also signed his name as Dongwu Old Sun. In his later years, he was addicted to opium, and his body became weaker and weaker. He died during the Anti-Japanese War. Wu Juemi was good at writing humorous articles and was the editor-in-chief of Freedom Talk for more than a year. Chen Diexian was in charge of Freedom Talk and the Home Knowledge column, which was very popular among readers. When Diexian solicited articles for Freedom Talk, he divided them into A, B, C, and D for remuneration. Someone copied a relatively unpopular and unfamiliar article from Liu Hedong's anthology, signed a name at will, and sent it to Diexian. It was published the next day and classified as C. Someone wrote a letter saying that this was an article by Liu Liuzhou, and deliberately did it as a test of the judge's judgment. Liu Liuzhou's article was C, then who is worthy of A? Diexian forcibly blamed himself and cancelled the grade. In addition, the illustrator was Qian Binghe from Wuxing. Binghe was first the director of the pictures of the three newspapers Min Hu Min Yu Min Li. The Three People's Daily advocated revolution, and its sharpness was unparalleled. Therefore, he was known as the old revolutionary painter. He entered this newspaper to make satirical paintings for many years. Because of his difficult situation, he believed that the name was unlucky, so he changed Binghe to Zhenhe. How could he know that the situation was even worse? In his later years, he also changed his name to Shichao, and ended up in poverty, which is very pitiful.</p>
