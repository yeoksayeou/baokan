<h3>總統巡視渤海要港　曾蒞葫蘆島昨已返抵平　東北大軍按照計劃停擊</h3>
<p>〔本報天津七日電〕總統於五日午由平飛蒞天津，徐永昌，兪濟時，曹聖芬等隨行，下機後，卽乘汽車赴塘沽，登軍艦東巡，桂永淸一日先抵塘，亦隨行，視察渤海沿岸葫蘆島各要港。各地官兵聞總統蒞止，莫不興奮萬狀，士氣百倍。七日下午一時，總統巡視完畢，返抵大沽口，即由塘沽換乘火車過津赴平，專車四時過津站稍停。總統戎裝立車中，精神奕奕，面露欣悅，車開行時，猶向外垂視。津軍政首長僅杜建時，陳長捷赴塘沽迎候，隨車返津。</p>

<h3>長春守為出擊進展　鄧文儀認撤守之說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕國防部發言人鄧文儀七日下午在記者招待會席上，對長春國軍之出動，僅證實爲「出擊」。並謂：詳細情形正電詢中，其活動範團為攻擊大房身機場。報戰長介撤守，國軍已南下至四平街以南之昌團，鄧氏認爲不確。渠稱：長春外圍有匪軍約十七個師，六萬餘人，惟係新改編奢，戰鬥力較弱，出擊之國軍，正與之對戰中。鄧氏拒絕證實長春已決定撤退或決定不撤退。參加招待會之外藉記者，對長春問題興趣頗濃，其發問幾悉以此爲中心。此外，對錦北發現「七六二俄式砲彈」事亦提出詢問，鄧氏未能確予解答，惟稱：該砲彈有未爆炸者，被我檢獲。某外記者稱：蘇聯如知其砲彈不爆炸，當亦認爲「可恥」！衆哄堂。</p>
<p>〔本報北平七日電〕北平電報局六日仍與長春電報局通報，官軍電亦照常收發，長春市府平辦事處四日曾收到尚傳道市長來電，長春國軍開始轉進之說尚待證實。</p>

<p>〔中央社長春七日電〕長出擊國軍，今續有進展，兵團司令親至前綫督導戰，寬城子機場匪已被我肅清，並已進佔長西楊家粉房南高地之匪陣地。昨夜收復小房身之國軍，今繼續前進，正向東大房身，回教義地之匪陣地進擊中。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春七日電〕今日此間天氣晴朗，上下午陸續有大批空軍運輸機來此空投。昨出擊國軍今續有進展，與匪交戰之槍爽快聲雖歷歷可聞，但一向每有飛機空投時即行盲身之匪爽砲則未鳴一響，大批物資乃得由較低之高度安全投下。</p>
<h3>陜東烽火復燃　朝邑澄城大荔平民均有戰鬥爭　汴國軍展開外圍掃蕩</h3>
<p>〔本報西安七日電〕關中東部戰事再起，匪酋王震親率第二縱隊，自郃陽以北地區南犯朝邑，戰况甚烈，國軍已由某地馳往迎擊，澄城·大茘·平民等地亦有戰事，傳匪首蕭克·韓鈞·已自晋南竄至黄龍山區，此間空軍昨今大批出動助戰。又，西安至華陰及咸銅支路之貨車，今起暫停運貨。</p>

<h3>彭國棟離徐晋京　報告濟陷匪經過</h3>
<p>吳化文被調佳太斯受訓　本報記者范式之已突圍</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州七日電〕魯民廳長彭國棟七日晨離徐赴京，向政院報吿濟南陷匪經過。行前吿記者，濟南戰役失利，全受吳化文叛變之影響，吳逆與毛匪勾結歷時已久，經常指定電台向毛匪報吿軍情，此次毛匪以山東主席爲酬，嗾使吳逆陣前叛變，吳逆利慾薰心，竟上其圈套，不料吳逆過去以後，僅編爲匪華東野戰軍第一軍軍長，吳逆本人且須先調佳木斯受訓半年，所謂山東主席僅一紙空頭支票。吳逆在濟南防守戰中，担負濟南西部及機塲守備任務，吳逆旣叛，使濟南西方門戶洞開，情勢岌岌可危，王兼司令官沉着機警，部署新陣綫，尙能支持一星期之久。王兼司令官在濟南未陷前腿部負傷，行動不便，突圍係由其衛士撐扶。同時匪方官兵對王兼司令官志在必得，每人均發有王之照片，王之被俘殆爲勢所難免。彭廳長係於九月卅日化裝逃出濟南内城者。彭廳長並吿記者，若干忠貞之新聞記者如中央社沈琢吾·申報范式之·新聞報王太諸君，均已突圍。以渠判斷，安全當無問題。按中央社濟南分社主任沈琢吾，已於本月六日安抵天津。</p>

<h3>立委注視經濟情勢　提議增強幣信·防止搶購·激勵生產　今第九次院會將勢烈討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕立法院第二會期第九次會議，定八日舉行，列入議程之報吿事項者，爲政院咨送審議之工商部附屬機關之組織條例案多件，至討論事項則僅列四案，悉爲有關當前財經緊急情勢之委員提案。値此游資泛濫，搶購風氣瀰漫之際，各立委咸亦集中目光於此一嚴重之現象，不約而同紛提議案，雖着重點各異，目標則一，八日院會必將有熱烈討論，茲誌各案要點如次</p>
<p>一·連謀等六十二人提議，速咨請行政院制止國營事業卽時單獨加價案（已刊六日本報）。</p>
<p>二·沈重予等一百廿六人提議補充穩定金圓價値辦法，以增强幣制之信用，而利施行案。其案由以爲，金圓價値之能否維持基於兩事：其一爲信用之有無，而非管制之疏密，故需創造信用，培養信用，其二爲生產力之大小，而非發行之多寡，故需增加生產，擴大社會容幣量，故據以擬提補充穩定金圓劵價値辦法如次：甲，關於培養發行信用者：（一）增加名額，擴充改組發行監理委會使能參加掌管並應用發行凖備及把握發行數量。（二）政府應卽制定並公布收支平衡之財政具體計劃，以消除人民對新幣膨脹之疑慮。（三）應將發行凖備基金，與八月十九日以後所收兌之金銀外幣，全數集中爲有計劃之運用，掌握民生必需物資，分區出售，以維護生產，供應民用，穩定物價，鞏固幣値。（四）停止發行五角之銀轉幣，所有一元以下之角輔幣，悉用鎳質，一角以下之分輔幣，悉用銅質。乙，關於增加生產者：（一）規定改制以前，生產事業之所有資　，折合金圓抵充資本之辦法。（二）由政府訂立提倡及維護生產事業之有關各項辦法，以發展生產，增進民生，培發稅源，包括生產事業資金融通辦法，生產事業技術人員由政府培養儲備辦法，生產事業保本保息辦法，生產事業擴充時之免稅减稅辦法等。</p>
<p>三，劉士篤等四十六人提議防止搶購，激勵生產，疏導游資，促進國民就業，以充裕物產，穩定物價，而宏經濟改革實效案，提供辦法八項如後（一）國營銀行局庫對於生產事業缺乏資金時，應景予放貸，但應盡量以定貨貸款方式收回物資，政府掌握足量之物資，藉以平定物價。（二）對於必需之機器及原料，國內無法取得或產量不足者，政府應鼓勵人民以自備外匯進口，或用進出口聯鎖方式准其進口，必要時並得酌量核給外匯。（三）市面游資充斥，尤以改革幣制收兌金·銀·外幣後，游資陡增，更有泛濫之虞，亟應引導從事生產，但人民對投資生產每懷戒心，政府應對投資人保證，使其本息不致遭受損失，一面使國營及民營事業之主持人提出群明計劃，對政府保證可以獲利，凡因政府保設而獲集資或增資之生產事業，應受政府主管機關之嚴密監督。（四）政府應於較有威績之農塲，工礦附設學校，招收失學或中途輟學靑年，半工半讀，硏習援術，造就生產人才。（五）政府應招集專科以上學校畢業而朱就業之靑年及政府各機關裁汰之冗員，開班訓練，講習安定地方，發展生產之方策，並使各就所長分別研討專門技術，政府應聘專家為講師，著有領導能力之通才爲指導員。（六）每期訓練卒業時，卽由各指導員率領學生分赴地方工作，政府應斟酌人地之宜，任命各指導員爲行政督察專員或縣長，使其於學員中自行尋找幹部，率領前往担負各種工作，其舊任職員因交代而失業者，應繼續入班受訓。（七）行政督察專員或縣長率領幹部到達地方，應卽發動地方人力，肅清奸匪，保衛治安，並舉辦生產事業。辦事前項事業，應擬具祥實之計劃，呈經上級政府核准，負責舉辦其計劃，在有民意機關之縣份，應取得民意機關同意，在綏靖區内應與軍事需要相配合。（八）各大都市實行憑證定量配購制度，以防市民搶購，政府一面以所掌握之物資調飾市塲，穩定物價。</p>
<p>四，吳幹等八十八人提義促進經濟合理化法案，本案以我國經濟由於長期通貨膨脹之影響，舉凡生產交換與分配之各種秩序紊亂已極，加以過去財政金融政策之錯誤，致使問題愈趨繁複嚴重，當此新幣建立之初，爲糾正此等種種不合理現象，並補充財經緊急處分令之疏漏，以確保新幣制之成功，乃擬提此「促進經濟合理化條例」，草案內容計分：「總則」，「財政上之措施」，「安全物價」，「疏導游資增加生產」，「改善金融政策配合全面經濟之合理化」等五章，共六十八條，合理化改革之範圍至爲廣泛。</p>

<h3>社論　論遼西走廊之戰</h3>
<p>濟南撤守以後，戰局重心移轉於遼西走廊。攻遼西，是共匪旣定的策略，所謂「秋季攻勢」，其目的就是要打通遼西走廊，與關內呼應，並與山東半島呼應。而守遼西，是國軍旣定的計劃：數月以來，國軍死守長瀋，其目的就是要牽制林彪，不讓他下錦州，取遼西。這是東北門戶之爭，整個東北存亡的命運也就决定在遼西走廊之得失。據本報瀋陽專電稱：共匪現正以全力冀奪遼西走廊，致國軍死命，國軍亦在加緊調動，已佈好大殱滅戰陣勢，誓在使匪軍整個崩潰。査共匪攻錦州錦西之兵力，共有五個縱隊，並有傾巢來犯的模樣。國軍方面，除范漢傑兵團外，海軍和陸戰隊，已開始在葫蘆島作緊急佈置，並傳孤守長春的軍隊亦有突圍南下援錦之說。看態勢，八方風雨會遼西，目前全盤戰局的重心將完全移轉於此。這是値得我們深切注意的。</p>
<p>現代化的戰爭，在戰役上，是爭點爭綫，並不重面；在戰略上，是爭門戶，爭港口。國軍過去在東北的頹勢，爭面顧不了綫，爭綫而又失去了點，似乎把棋子走死了，幸好遼西在握，阻截了林彪的大軍：長瀋固守不放，牽制了匪軍的流動。國軍守長瀋，固然費力氣，而匪軍不能長驅直入，甚至連鐵路也不能貫通，是更顯得費力。所以東北之戰，完全是一塲消耗戰。林彪何嘗不想輕取長瀋？祗是自度力量不够，他又不願多付較大的賭本。長瀋的國軍何嘗不能轉守爲攻？祇是全局轉守爲攻的時機未成熟，需要沉着忍耐以觀變。在形勢上，國軍握有遼西走廊，錦州仍能與藩陽遙相呼應，瀋陽仍不失爲長春的支撐點。如果遼西力量增加，錦瀋的打通不僅有可能說不定能把長春這顆死子也救活來。反之，匪軍如能佔領遼西走廊，不僅在東面完成了對瀋陽的包圍，並且能向西發展，逐漸縮小對平津的包圍圈。所以匪軍時時想取錦州及其附近地區，扼死長瀋國軍於進退失據之地。</p>
<p>遼西走廊爲東北的門戶，並且是華北內陸和海洋的門戶。現在的遼西走廊，受旅大的威脅，已成瓦全之勢，尙未臨玉碎之局。國軍，爲何要固守這個瓦全之局。並不惜陸續投下生力軍呢？與其是說是鞏固長瀋，毌寗說是確保華北。這是遼西走廊在地勢上决定了的，不能不於窮中求變。顧祖禹著「讀史方輿紀要」，縱論天下兵略地略，對東北西北邊陲相當忽視，而獨對遼西走廊寄予重視：這是由於歷史發展的事實决定了的。所以今日保天下者，不能不確保遼西走廊。顧祖禹分析遼西走廊的重要性有言：「控取戎貉，限隔海島，憑恃險遠，足以自封。契丹據有其地，以侵擾中華。金人亦啟疆於此，用以滅遼弱宋。蒙古取遼東西，而金人根本撥矣。自昔並有遼東者，常藉以蠶食幽薊，爲中原禍。」足見遼西不僅爲東北門戶，而且爲華北內陸的門戶。東北之戰，爭綫爭面的階段過去了，現已臨到爭重點爭門戶的階段。這一戰爭，非但要决定東北在戰略上最後的命運，抑且對華北大陸的形勢也要發生重大影響的。</p>
<p>東北是中華民國的東北，故東北之得失，關係中華命運至大。爲了固守遼西，確保華北，從而打通東北，是需要全國的人，費力氣的。所以說東北之爭，是全國家命運之爭。我們注視遼西走廊之戰，應以緊張的心情和脈膊，考慮如何根本澄淸東北之道：如果單是坐觀一城一地之得失，萬萬不可的。</p>

<h3>「浮動病」「一窩風」「享樂狂」　不正常心理造成社會畸形現象　上海人自尋煩惱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕各處搶購風氣、昨已漸趨緩和。綜觀數日來各商店門前之所謂「搶購行列」，如稍加分析，卽可發現一般市民心理上多染有「浮動病」，而此種社會性病症，實爲今後經管當局所應注意，且須妥籌對策。所謂「搶購行列」中，除一部份意圖乘機牟利之「黄牛」外，大部市民並非急需其所欲搶購之物資，如呢絨布疋等。在一中等家庭中消費數量原極有限，此次所以逾量購儲，甚且有將已存入銀行之存款（據記者調査結果，該項存款十分之七以上係八一九後新開戶，似均爲調換舊藏金鈔後所得之餘資）提出購買，皆因惑於人言，往往某里弄中有一戶購物方歸，對人談及某種物資價格極賤，現各店存貨將屠、今冬恐無法購得等等，於是卽輾轉相吿，雖其事毫無根據，然衆口流傳，演擇成理，同里弄之各戶遂亦紛紛競往爭購。</p>
<p>此種心理浮動現象，在排隊時尤易見到。記者曾親見有主婦數人，淸晨在絨綫店前排隊，因不耐擠軋久候，竟相率退出，並頻謂「將來總可以買到的」，可見渠等原無預定計劃，亦足證上海社會「一窩風」風氣爲害之烈。</p>
<p>至娛樂業方面，近週來亦充分表現「浮動病」到處流佈：影院戲館生涯鼎盛，卽開映舊片之二三輪影院，亦常吿客滿；各舞廳座無隙地，舞池中幾至不能轉身；鄰近本市之風景區都市，「上海客」充斥載途，各旅館莫不利市十倍。揆厥原因，仍係一般昔日從事投機商業者爲之倡導，渠等因各種市塲俱受管制，用武無地，而又不願遽以遊資投向生產，遂呼朋引類，自我享樂，風氣所趨，稍與渠等有關之親友屬僚，一時俱感確應及時行樂，心理上浮動之結果，娛樂業遂呈空前繁榮。</p>
<p>各舞廳由於經常客滿，座位不敷，一部舞客在茶舞時間結束後，卽在内進餐，籌待晚塲開始，始終固守不去，惟恐座位被佔。其他較小舞廳，平日緊乏豪客光顧者，近日門前汽車排列成行，已屬數見不鮮。據多數舞女談稱：渠等最近亦供不應求，收入突增，姿色較爲平庸者，其每日進益亦較前增至數倍。當局雖曾一再規定舞客須購舞票付給舞資，但目前情形，則幾全部係現鈔交易，尤以茶舞時間爲尤甚，舞廳當宣稱渠等營業並不如外傳之盛，舞票不多，卽爲其所引證之最大理由。</p>
<p>此外「浮動病」表南於酒樓菜館中者，亦至為咨刻。各酒菜館自經上次決定拒購黑市蔬菜後，較珍貴之鷄·翅·參等已漸小供應，惟仍有豪客向菜館預定，請設法以黑市價購進，祗求肴饌精美，渠等亦不惜照黑市價格付給。現全市各酒菜館每日不能客滿者，竟被人目爲奇事，據堂倌告人：食客中近來特喜徵妓侑酒，詢之妓院方面，渠等亦承認近一月來「堂差」突增，普通六百元一席之「花頭」，平均每日均有客預定。根據渠等觀察，近來顧客中似多帶有一種「享樂狂」，實則此種狂態仍係根源於「浮動病」症。如何使此病症歸於寗靜，實爲疏導社會經濟秩序經管當局目前一大要務。</p>

<h3>傷害國代夫人案　李笑侯供極含混　還押之前索閱筆錄良久始退</h3>
<p>本報訊〕本年八月八日晨，寄寓本市之江西國大代表王冠英夫人閔彬如，在寓所被李笑侯（又名李崇光）以鐵管猛擊傷害一案，前經地檢處以傷害及殺人未遂罪嫌，對李提起公訴，地院昨晨初審，被吿李笑侯着灰呢西服，未結領帶，面目瘦削。審訊前渠連口供稱：渠與王閔彬如及伊之弟媳間，關係極爲複雜，現正向各處搜集證件，要求庭上延期開審，庭諭不准。</p>
<p>據李供稱：渠現年卅八歲，民卅三年在渝時，與王冠英認識，勝利後來滬，因許多複雜關係，渠因被動不得不審寓王家，閔之年輕弟媳，亦在王寓另屋居住，閔夫離滬到京，常藉故與渠談話，渠力求設法避免與伊接近。八月七日晚（卽出事前夕），渠在外宴請新由美返國之友人，返寓甚遲，及抵寓則見閔與汪姓房客在亭子間內對談，注見渠吿稱，王太太願代渠墊付宴友所費之款，渠當卽辭謝。旋脫除襯衫長褲，出屋納凉，迨回屋欲睡之際，閔之弟媳，突入內代閔要求與渠談話。至此，庭上以其所供與渠謀害閔彬如事實，似無直接關係，且所供關係複雜一節，亦極含混，當問渠是否有神經病。渠以堅定。吻供答「否」，繼供當時係閔先動手，渠乃以鐵管還擊，絕無將伊殺害之意。至於檢察官起訴書內所稱渠常濫發空頭支票，致閔對渠時加諷剌，因而懷恨傷害一節，渠稱係閔事後飾詞，絕非事實。旋傳訊原吿閔彬如及證人王冠英均未到，庭上庭諭改期再審。被吿還押前，當庭索閱書記官之口供筆錄，良久始退。</p>

<h3>卅六年美金公債　本息兌付辦法　公債本息應存中央銀行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自財經緊急處分令頒佈後，關於卅六年美金公債償付本息辦法有無變更，以及（一）已到期而尙未付訖之本息特票人前來兌付，是否在有效期間，仍無限制照付美匯。（二）上項本息持票人，如願以金圓兌付，可否由經理銀行照開央行抬頭美金匯票，交特票人轉售中央銀行。（三）本年九月底到期本息應如何兌付各節，已由經理銀行呈請財部解釋，業由財部簽奉政院核示如次：</p>

<h3>糖市徵軟</h3>

<h3>絲市平靜　綢緞仍俏</h3>
<p>人絲來源日呈枯竭，交易冷落，市况呆鈍，絲號要求中信局配絲，但磋商結果，仍未許可，人心頗爲　唐。公會委託配售存量，亦日見减少，每日限配一百包，昨日仍申購一空。生絲日來因綢緞銷路盛旺，人心堅穩，絲織業吸胃不弱，惟執戶脫意甚懈，交易轉冷，業中未聞成交。</p>

<h3>棉布交易　轉移地點</h3>

<h3>錢業交換保證金　增資前先繳一半</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國錢業聯合會代表秦潤卿。沈日新。王繹齋等十餘人，昨晨赴央行請願，當由業務局李副局長接見。各代表一致要求交換保證金於增資完成後，再按各地情形分級核减繳納。並請通知各地央行，於規定限期前，不再拒收法幣滙款。李副局長表示：交換保證金已准於增資前先繳一半，增資後再收五成。法幣滙款於十一月二十日限期後，絕對不得拒收，將通函各分行遵辦。</p>
<p>要求减低增資數額</p>
<p>又各地代表將於明日晋京，向財部請願，要求减低增資額，並將期限展至六個月，增資現金部份不予凍結，存放利率亦不予硬性抑低等。據秦潤卿表示：增資標凖太高，非普通行莊所能負担，而合併經營亦有事實上之困難。以存款而論，帳面雖有增加，但均屬浮存性質，毫不穩定，難作有計劃之運用。且因目前搶購商品之風潮，存款已見减少。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>履歷片</h3>
<p>— 明虛</p>
<p>晚飯方罷，靠在沙發裏和家人談天，妻似乎想起了什麽似的，忽然立起身來，在梳妝合的玻璃板下拿出了一張紙片，走過來吿訴我說：</p>
<p>「剛才程太太來過了，她說她們那位今年剛剛大學畢業的大少爺想找一個事情做做，無論如何要請你帮一個忙。」</p>
<p>她手裏拿的自然就是那位程大少爺的履歷片了，滿紙都是扭揑作態的鋼筆字，據他們說這呌做「花體」，不過在我們業已落伍的人們看來，却祗覺得每一個字都欹肩側身，像在跳Jitterbug舞的神氣。</p>
<p>「好，瞧機會罷。」我一面回答，一面就順手把履歷片放在茶儿上。</p>
<p>老實說，看見了這種字體我就已經頗有惡感，卽使我自己主管的那個部門裏要添人，我也不麒呌這樣一個人進來的，公文上全是東倒西歪難以辨識的字，這還成什麽體統！</p>
<p>我抽了一口烟，不禁脫口而出：</p>
<p>「這種怪字是大學畢業生寫出來的麽！」</p>
<p>妻倒笑了，「我看現在大學生寫的字倒是這樣子的居多。難道現代的大學裏，還要逼牢了學生呌他們練書法麼？」</p>
<p>我一想，前幾天還有任職某國家銀行的一個朋友談起，他負責的一部裏要添人，要能辦稿，字要漂亮，要精神充沛，然而我了幾個月，仍舊祗得用了一位年逾花甲的老夫子。他們也曾招考過幾次大學畢業生，竟然沒有一個能合格的。</p>
<p>在今天，大學敎育和現實脫節，已經是人人都知道的事實。在大學裏讀西洋文學的人，跑出學校來做中學英文敎師彷彿就算是用其所學的了，但是他在成爲一個好敎師之前，大概已經把大學中孜孜硏習的喬叟，密爾頓，莫里哀，席勒……等等全部付之腦後，倒重新捧起了納氏文法之類一條條地記那些定義定則來了。中國文學系畢業出來的人做一個機關裏的秘書，也算是「對工」的，可是照現在大學裏的課程看看，他也許對楚辭或易經頗有硏究，懂一點文字音義嬗變之跡；但是，若要呌他辦一件内容相當複雜的文稿，却十有八九是弄不淸的。呌他管檔案罷，事情好似容易，却也須有周密敏捷的頭腦才能迅速分出子目。譬如我上文提起的某國家銀行，規模極大，可是檔案却就極亂，有時要査一件半個月前的舊案，竟就會査了兩三天還沒有查出來—甚至於常常會根本查不着。這種事情，銀行的當局是極明白的，他們何嘗不想振作一下，添些精明幹練年當力壯的靑年？可是，這些技能却正是大學所不屑一敎的！於是腐氣沉沉的那些所謂「老公事」者，就成爲各機關的　寳，昔年書吏包攬之弊，竟已經常見於今日！</p>
<p>有沒有補救之道呢？當然有。治本之道，是要等到天下承平之後的，無非是要政府保障學人的生活，獎勵各種學術研究等等，和今天的現實所能許可者相差太遠，我們不談。若說要針對目前實際情形的治標的辦法，那麽，我主張在大學裏要有兩套敎育，非添出若干實用科目不可。</p>
<p>譬如說，文學院中，除掉現在所敎的文學史，作家研究，名著研究等功課仍舊不妨開班之外，必須增加的課理，應當有：（一）編輯技巧，（二）公文程式，（三）檔案管理，（四）寫作技巧（不是大學一年國文中的作文，而是「刀筆」），（五）書法及中英文打字，（六）國語粤語滬語……等等。讀政治的人除應當學上面所述公文程式檔案管理之外，還須學習：（一）禮儀，務求儀表好，卽使長得不漂亮也須落落大方，進退中節，不可鬼鬼祟祟，寒傖取厭；（二）姑且名之爲「官學」罷，例如批公文如何輕重得當，還有本談前幾天談得很熱鬧的如何辦報銷辦移交等等；不是呌你學作弊，是呌你知道如何防範別人作弊。理工科的學生除掉必須學習工廠管理之外，也必須學學如何處理勞資糾紛等等實際的問題。此外，最好大家學一點敎書術，學學如何維持敎室秩序，如何引起學生注意等等，以便必要時還可以敎敎書。我決不是看不起敎書，但我認爲敎書應當是師範大學畢業生的職業，普通大學畢業生應當另尋出路。</p>
<p>你說我是空想嗎？其實我的建議是眞正切合實際的。否則，你看，就在我這沙發旁邊的茶几上，就又來了這麼一張命運不佳的履歷片……</p>
<h3>題月雁圖</h3>
<p>— 張不渠</p>
<p>極天關塞月三更，寒雁呌羣萬里程；又是稻榮謀未定，江南草木已秋聲！</p>
<h3>入秋頻醉有感</h3>
<p>愁城日日酒兵攻，未許醉翁萬念空，近宅呢喃別巢燕，遙天嘹唳避燴鴻；西風楊葉凋殘綠，暮爾　花滴碎紅，百尺高枝秋寂寞，更難回首北牕桐。</p>
<h3>賭局</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>最近在一次朋友家的宴會裏，看到一次規模並不怎樣大的沙蟹博局。僅僅憑了一張底牌的秘密，大家聚精會神，爭奪着桌中心的一大疊金圓券。這在各人的表情上可以看出事態的嚴重性。A覽緊着肩頭，面部肌肉缺少彈性，眼神一直注視着別人的「面牌」，細細揣摩着，B的嘴角裏斜着一枝烟捲，爍灰已積至半寸許長，還沒有掉下來的可能，不住翻翻自己的底牌，想從自己的實力來與敵人作孤注一擲……等到C把身邊所有的鈔票全數往桌中一推時，其他幾個人的眼睛全部都呆住了，考慮着要不要和他拱一下。</p>
<p>這眞是一種亡命式的賭博，圍繞着圓桌周邊的一羣賭客，在其時的小墨子裏，大都有赴湯蹈火的精神，無怪參加博局中的D君，當他放棄了那一次的最後攤牌戰局時，以閑適的姿態笑着對旁觀的筆者說，賭「蟹」有如作戰，兩者都需要懂得「兵法』的</p>
<p>賭「蟹」有如作戰，我想，新聞記者是早已參透此意了。翻開今日的報章，常常在頭條新聞裏可以看到「攤牌」這一屬於沙蟹的術語。考攤牌一辭，在上海俗語中所謂「甩沙蟹」，把渾身解數和盤托出，若要和他較量，就非憑着你自己的實力來硬拚不可！</p>
<p>從近日的社會形勢看，似乎人生也在從事沙蟹的博局了。有許多人把金銀外幣所換來的金圓，轉換到奢侈的享受這一方面去，大者買屋置產，中者搜羅珍寳，添置衣飾，小也者游山玩水，流連聲色—據說今年秋天杭州的旅館全部客滿，原因就是爲了上海一批股票商作爲「游資」宣洩的罅隙之一。</p>
<p>大家似乎以「一沙了之」來排遣低氣壓的季節，以盡情享受，抱今日有酒今日醉的態度來把生命作孤注之一擲，這一塲賭博進出之大，可以想見一般。</p>
<p>提倡勤儉來校正奢侈，當然是對症下藥，問題是在怎樣把人心轉捩過來，使他們自趨於儉約的順流中去。這轉捩點應該是「安定」。生活安定，才能惜物如金，因爲現在已經不是徒用口號的時代了。</p>
<h3>記青卡隱居圖</h3>
<p>— 彭谷聲</p>
<p>淸同治年間，贛省有兩大收藏家呂狄曼農（學耕）以收藏金石書畫名，繆芷汀（德棻）以收藏版本名。曼農卽狄平子先生之尊人，精鑑賞，收藏甚富，其平生所最寳貴之畫有二，一爲宋人所畫五老圖册，後歸盛希伯者；一爲王蒙所作靑卞隱居圖，此圖山用枯筆，樹用濃墨，神氣淋漓，縱横蕭散，純法巨然，其荒率峭逸，則有靑出於藍之妙。上有董香光行書「天下第一王叔明」題識，並錄倪雲林詩云：「筆精墨妙王右軍，澄懷觀道宗少文，王侯筆力能扛鼎，五百年來無此君。」其爲倪董推重如此。</p>
<p>是圖向爲眞賞齋天籟閣遞藏，曼翁游宦江西得之，如獲至寳，不肯輕易示人。時贛臬王某，亦有書畫癖，偶訪見之，竟欲豪奪去，狄則誓以身殉，決不割愛，幾演淸明上河圖故事，幸經某道斡旋，以五老圖歸王，事始得解，平等閣筆記，嘗述其梗槪。</p>
<p>平等閣皮藏名畫不下百數十件，獨以此圖爲壓軸之神品。平子在日，珍同球璧，雖至好如王子展（卽王克敏之父），倩觀多次，僅得一見，日本愛好書畫者，亦多覬覦此圖，屢欲重金收買，卒以平子不爲所動，幸免臨川四寳之續。後値日皇壽誕，日本皇族，挽人邀倩平子赴日鑑別日宮所藏金石書畫，並以六十萬金保險，此圖携往展覽，其名貴可知也。摹本有五，以潤州　君石摹現歸東瀛者爲最佳。有正書局亦有影印本，刦後不易購到矣。</p>
<h3>皮肖學</h3>
<p>「食無肉」的風光，今甚普遍，閱本報所載，知上海亦然，蓋此種現象有限價及缺貨爲總因，自有營遍性，無地域之別。惟北平無肉之苦悶，與他處不同，普遍性又有其特殊性。遠自石晋割棄燕雲十六州於契丹，以至蒙元建都，皆以游牧之族，爲此大都市之主宰，上行下效，風行草偃，故北平街名多「羊肉胡同」，「豬市口」（今改珠市口），牛血胡同（今改留學路），馬市街，羊觕角胡同，牛尾巴胡同，歸馬市大街，如此以牛羊豬馬各式名目大街小巷，多不可數，猶可想見遼金元淸時代，滿城羊肉牛乳，劃腥啗羶，屠門大嚼，無時不肉，每餐必肉之塞外紮象，如在目前。至如近代之有淸皇室，更有「吃肉」之大典，大臣以得賞「宮中吃肉」爲至榮，敍宦途緩歷及訃聞中，以此與「賞坐轎」「賞珍寳」各榮典同列。「吃肉」時，御座前，及各大臣案几前，各置肉一大盤，列刀箸，無別味，各臣謝恩領賞，自割自吃，有將食餘之肉出時掛在輿後，以爲誇耀者。各旗籍王公大臣家庭遇祭祀，遇家慶，亦仿宮庭，大猪大羊，烹以　客，不到或到而不多吃，即對主人爲不敬。漢人中久居此地，亦染旗俗，如紀曉嵐（昀）每餐不用米麵，只以肉爲主食。以上均見姚氏「竹葉亭」，梁氏「歸田瑣記」，及各家筆記。</p>
<p>市肆間及民間之「肉」業及式樣名額之多，尤爲舊都之特色。如專以「肉」爲業者，除菜市之生肉案外，有醬肘舖，（名爲　肘，實則鹹腿香腸，豬身各部，除豬頭尾外，無不庖製，並兼賣生肉。）有醬羊肉舖，牛肉舖，或牛羊並售，惟與豬肉店則劃若鴻溝，謂之「隔敎」。其熟製品與生肉並售，則與醬肉舖同。有專以肉味供餐之飯舖，如西城之白肉館（即沙鍋居，以全豬身之各部分製爲種種名式，不用菜蔬及別味。）及羊肉館。（如西來順，一畝園，正陽樓，烤肉陳等，不可數計，專以羊身各味供饌，有烤刷烹調各式吃法。）又有專賣烤羊肉，醬羊肉，牛肉之小舖小攤，有專賣豬頭肉，羊頭肉，猪腸（名日炒肝），羊腸（名曰霜腸），羊肚（名日爆肚）及牛筋，羊雜之各攤，各提籃小　或在各市塲或沿巷呌賣，直至深夜。際此秋高氣爽，北風漸勁，以迄冬季，正是爐火熊熊，肉香四溢。其在南來之食物舖，如福建之肉鬆舖，廣東之臘肉香腸舖，以及鷄鴨各舖，皆飩然以「肉」爲業，無肉則無業。無此等業，則城市繁榮卽太半消失了。</p>
<p>不專賣「肉品」而肉仍爲要棄者，如各中西菜館，各南味店（「稻香」之類），以及葷食舖（餛飩，餃子，肉餅之類），亦何可一日無肉。乃自上月中旬以來，市面之肉，由缺而絕，生肉，熟肉，肉製品，大起恐慌。有些止　上門，有些臨時改業（如賣肉食之攤改爲炸豆腐之類），市而蕭索異常。至九月下句又漸呈活無，除生肉店依然空冷外，凡熟製肉及肉料食品各舖各攤，忽復貨色充盈，各中西菜館之肉亦源源不絕，說是直接買自屠宰塲，其實還不是黑市大余嗎？他們大價買來，大價賣出。種類多，名式雜，「八一九」是何標準，原無法査淸，况熟製肉又有作料，製法不同，可以措詞，大有伸縮之餘地。</p>
<p>惟菜市之生肉案子，不論牛羊猪，仍然空空如也。因之家庭主婦一廚役買肉，做菜或做包子餛飩等，毫無辦法，而凡欲過肉　者，只可去舖子買醬肉，燻肉，就小攤或呌賣者買香腸，買猪頭肉羊頭肉。生羊肉尚有少數售者，猪肉則非熟人絕不可得。</p>

        <h1>1948.10.08</h1>
<h3>The President Inspects Important Coastal Ports of Bohai Sea, Visited Huludao and Returned to Beiping Yesterday, Northeast Army Ceases Fire According to Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 7th] The President flew from Beiping to Tianjin at noon on the 5th, accompanied by Xu Yongchang, Yu Jishi, Cao Shengfen, and others. After disembarking, he took a car to Tanggu, boarded a warship, and sailed east to inspect important ports along the Bohai Sea coast, including Huludao. Gui Yongqing arrived in Tanggu a day earlier and accompanied the President. Local officers and soldiers were extremely excited to hear of the President's arrival, and their morale was boosted a hundredfold. At 1:00 PM on the 7th, the President completed his inspection and returned to Dagu Port, where he transferred to a train to Tianjin and then to Beiping. The special train stopped briefly at Tianjin Station at 4:00 PM. The President, in military uniform, stood in the train car, looking energetic and cheerful, gazing outwards as the train departed. Only Du Jianshi and Chen Changjie, the top military and political officials in Tianjin, went to Tanggu to greet him and returned to Tianjin with the train.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] The President returned to Beiping by train at 6:30 PM on the 7th.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] On the 6th, the President visited Huludao by warship to inspect the area, summoned generals from Jinzhou and Jinxi to listen to their reports, and offered comfort and guidance before leaving Huludao. The President is determined to secure a superior position in the Northeast war.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The various Northeast armies on the offensive continue to advance according to the planned schedule. The bandits have been forced to change their plan to seize western Liaoning, and appear to be urgently withdrawing their main forces. For example, the bandit Fourth Column in Xingcheng seems to be retreating eastward across the Daling River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] National troops have entered the urban area of Anshan. On the 7th, they actively began providing relief to the returning refugees. Zhao Jie, the mayor of Anshan, is scheduled to depart from Shenyang for his post on the morning of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Tangshan Dispatch, 7th] The bandits who attacked Shanhaiguan have retreated to their previous positions, and the situation at Yuguan has stabilized.</p>
<p>[Our Chengde Dispatch, 7th] It is reported that the powerful mobile units of the 13th Army, in order to support the Liaoxi campaign, reinforced the eastern offensive on the night of the 6th. On the 7th, the vanguard had already approached Pingquan and is continuing to advance. Another unit of the National Army is still cooperating with the Self-Defense Force, maneuvering and suppressing bandits between Chengde and Pingquan. The southwest area of Pingquan is about to enter the clearing stage. The Rehe Provincial Government is actively strengthening rural organizations, preparing to recover Pingquan when the opportunity arises.</p>
<h3>The Defense of Changchun Develops into an Offensive, Deng Wenyi Claims Reports of Withdrawal Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] At a press conference on the afternoon of the 7th, Deng Wenyi, the spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed only that the National Army's movement in Changchun was an "offensive." He stated that detailed information was being requested by telegram, and that its operational scope was an attack on the Dafangshen Airport. Reports of the National Army withdrawing from Changchun and retreating south to the area south of Sipingjie were deemed inaccurate by Deng. He claimed that there were approximately seventeen divisions, or more than 60,000 bandits, on the outskirts of Changchun. However, these were newly reorganized units with weaker combat capabilities. The attacking National Army is currently engaged in battle with them. Deng refused to confirm whether a decision had been made to withdraw from Changchun or not. Foreign journalists attending the press conference showed great interest in the Changchun issue, focusing almost all their questions on it. Additionally, inquiries were made about the discovery of "762 Russian-made artillery shells" north of Jinzhou. Deng was unable to provide a definitive answer, but stated that some of the shells had not exploded and were recovered by our forces. One foreign journalist remarked that if the Soviets knew their artillery shells were not exploding, they would also consider it "shameful!" The audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] On the 6th, the Beiping Telegraph Bureau was still communicating with the Changchun Telegraph Bureau, and official telegrams were still being received and sent as usual. The Changchun Municipal Government Office in Beiping received a telegram from Mayor Shang Chuandao on the 4th. Reports of the National Army beginning to withdraw from Changchun still need to be confirmed.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] The Changchun garrison has recently been developing towards the southwest, but has not taken any active action. Furthermore, a portion of the bandit Twelfth Column around Changchun has moved south, appearing to be attempting to flee towards Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The National Army's offensive from Changchun continues to make progress today. The corps commander personally supervised the battle at the front line. The bandits at the Kuanchengzi Airport have been cleared, and the bandit positions on the southern high ground of Yangjiafenfang, west of Changchun, have been occupied. The National Army, which recovered Xiaofangshen last night, continues to advance today, attacking the bandit positions in Dongdafangshen and the Hui Nationality Cemetery.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The weather here was clear today, and large numbers of Air Force transport planes arrived in succession throughout the morning and afternoon to airdrop supplies. The offensive National Army continued to make progress today. Although the sound of gunfire in the battle with the bandits could still be heard clearly, the bandits, who usually panic and fire wildly whenever planes airdrop supplies, did not fire a single shot this time. As a result, large quantities of supplies were safely dropped from a lower altitude.</p>
<h3>Flames of War Reignite in Shaanxi, Civilians in Chaoyi, Chengcheng, and Dali All Involved in Fighting, National Army in Bian (Kaifeng) Launches Outer Perimeter Sweeps</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 7th] The war in eastern Guanzhong has reignited. Bandit chief Wang Zhen personally led the Second Column southward from the area north of Heyang, attacking Chaoyi with great intensity. The National Army has rushed from a certain location to intercept them. Fighting has also broken out in Chengcheng, Dali, Pingmin, and other places. It is rumored that bandit leaders Xiao Ke and Han Jun have fled from southern Shanxi to the Huanglong Mountains. The Air Force has dispatched large numbers of aircraft yesterday and today to assist in the battle. Furthermore, freight trains from Xi'an to Huayin and the Xiantong Branch Line have temporarily suspended freight transport starting today.</p>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 7th] Liu Ruzhen, the commander of the 68th Army stationed in Bian (Kaifeng), believing that the city is suffering from a severe shortage of food and firewood, and to expand the security zone and secure food sources, has specially dispatched his troops to launch autumn sweeps in nearby counties in the rain. The various elite units have been reporting victories every day. Ge Kaixiang's 81st Division completely suppressed most of the local Communists in the Tongxu area on the 6th. One platoon of that division even annihilated nearly 200 bandits in Sisuolou, Tongxu, on the 6th, capturing 25 alive through clever tactics.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 7th] A major battle is brewing in southern Henan. Liu's 10th and 12th Columns fled from Wangkuandian, northeast of Tongbai, to the Huyangzhen area southwest of Tanghe County yesterday. Furthermore, Liu's 11th, 3rd, and 6th Columns moved south from Jiudianbao and Anzhen, northwest of Biyang, through Yuanzezhen, northeast of Tanghe County. Chen Geng's 4th Column fled to the vicinity of Yuxian, and the 9th Column fled to Yuekoupu, northeast of Yuxian, and Ludian, east of Dengfeng.</p>
<p>[Our Xinxiang Dispatch, 7th] The county seat of Yangwu in northern Henan was captured by bandits on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 7th] On the 7th, the National Army in western Shandong launched extensive sweeps in the area north of Fengxian (Jiangsu Province).</p>
<h3>Peng Guodong Leaves Xuzhou for the Capital, Reports on the Fall of Jinan</h3>
<p>Wu Huawen Transferred to Jiamusi for Training, Our Reporter Fan Shizhi Has Broken Through the Siege</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 7th] Peng Guodong, the Commissioner of the Shandong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, left Xuzhou for the capital on the morning of the 7th to report to the Executive Yuan on the fall of Jinan to the bandits. Before his departure, he told reporters that the defeat in the Jinan campaign was entirely due to Wu Huawen's defection. Wu had been colluding with Mao Zedong for a long time, frequently using radio stations designated to report military intelligence to Mao. This time, Mao offered him the chairmanship of Shandong as a reward, enticing Wu to defect before the battle. Wu, blinded by greed, fell into Mao's trap. Unexpectedly, after Wu's defection, he was only incorporated into the Communist East China Field Army as the commander of the First Army, and Wu himself had to be transferred to Jiamusi for six months of training first. The so-called chairmanship of Shandong was merely an empty promise. During the defense of Jinan, Wu Huawen was responsible for defending the western part of Jinan and the airport. Wu's defection opened the western gateway to Jinan, making the situation extremely precarious. Commander Wang Yao-wu was calm and alert, deploying a new line of defense that was able to hold out for another week. Commander Wang Yao-wu was wounded in the leg before the fall of Jinan, making it difficult for him to move. His escape was assisted by his guards. At the same time, the Communist officers and soldiers were determined to capture Commander Wang, with each person being issued a photograph of him. Wang's capture was almost inevitable. Commissioner Peng escaped from the inner city of Jinan on September 30th in disguise. Commissioner Peng also told reporters that several loyal journalists, such as Shen Zhuowu of the Central News Agency, Fan Shizhi of Shen Bao, and Wang Tai of Xinwen Bao, had all broken through the siege. In his judgment, their safety should not be a problem. It is noted that Shen Zhuowu, the director of the Central News Agency's Jinan branch, arrived safely in Tianjin on the 6th of this month.</p>

<h3>Legislators Focus on Economic Situation, Propose Strengthening Currency Confidence, Preventing Panic Buying, and Encouraging Production, Heated Discussions Expected at Today's Ninth Session of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The ninth session of the second term of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 8th. The agenda includes multiple draft organization regulations for affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce submitted by the Executive Yuan for review. The discussion items include only four proposals from legislators related to the current urgent financial and economic situation. Amid the current flood of speculative capital and widespread panic buying, legislators are focusing on this serious phenomenon. They have submitted proposals with different emphases but the same goal. Heated discussions are expected at the session on the 8th. The key points of each proposal are summarized below:</p>
<p>1.  A proposal by Lian Mou and 62 others, urging the Executive Yuan to stop state-owned enterprises from unilaterally raising prices immediately (already published in the 6th issue of this newspaper).</p>
<p>2.  A proposal by Shen Chongyu and 126 others to supplement measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan, to enhance the credibility of the currency and facilitate its implementation. The proposal argues that the ability to maintain the value of the Gold Yuan depends on two factors: the existence of credibility, not the strictness of controls, so it is necessary to create and cultivate credibility; and the size of productivity, not the quantity of issuance, so it is necessary to increase production and expand the social capacity for the currency. Accordingly, the following measures are proposed to supplement the measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan: A. Regarding cultivating the credibility of issuance: (1) Increase the number of members, expand and reorganize the Issuance Supervisory Committee so that it can participate in managing and applying the issuance reserves and control the quantity of issuance. (2) The government should immediately formulate and announce a concrete fiscal plan for balancing revenue and expenditure to eliminate public concerns about the inflation of the new currency. (3) The issuance reserve fund and all the gold, silver, and foreign currency collected after August 19th should be concentrated for planned use, controlling essential goods for people's livelihoods, selling them by region to maintain production, supply civilian use, stabilize prices, and consolidate currency value. (4) Stop issuing the 5-cent silver-converted currency; all auxiliary coins under one yuan should be made of nickel, and auxiliary coins under one cent should be made of copper. B. Regarding increasing production: (1) Stipulate a method for converting all assets of production enterprises before the currency reform into Gold Yuan to offset capital. (2) The government should formulate relevant measures to promote and maintain production enterprises to develop production, improve people's livelihoods, and cultivate tax sources, including measures for financing production enterprises, measures for the government to train and reserve technical personnel for production enterprises, measures for guaranteeing the principal and interest of production enterprises, and tax exemption and reduction measures when production enterprises expand.</p>
<p>3.  A proposal by Liu Shidu and 46 others to prevent panic buying, encourage production, channel speculative capital, and promote national employment, to enrich material resources, stabilize prices, and realize the practical effects of economic reform. It provides eight measures as follows: (1) State-owned banks and treasuries should provide loans to production enterprises when they lack funds, but they should recover materials as much as possible through order-based loans. The government should control sufficient materials to stabilize prices. (2) For necessary machinery and raw materials that cannot be obtained domestically or whose output is insufficient, the government should encourage people to import them with their own foreign exchange or allow them to import them using import-export linking methods, and if necessary, also approve the allocation of foreign exchange appropriately. (3) There is a glut of speculative capital on the market, especially after the currency reform and the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency, and speculative capital has increased sharply, with an even greater risk of flooding. It is urgent to guide it to engage in production, but people are wary of investing in production. The government should guarantee investors to prevent their principal and interest from suffering losses. At the same time, the heads of state-owned and private enterprises should propose comprehensive plans, guaranteeing the government that they can make profits. All production enterprises that have raised funds or increased capital due to government guarantees should be subject to close supervision by the government authorities. (4) The government should establish schools affiliated with agricultural fields and industrial and mining enterprises with relatively high achievements, recruiting out-of-school or dropout youth to study skills through part-time work and part-time study to cultivate production talents. (5) The government should recruit youths who have graduated from colleges and universities but are unemployed and redundant personnel dismissed from various government agencies, opening training classes to teach strategies for stabilizing localities and developing production, and allowing each person to study specialized technologies according to their strengths. The government should hire experts as lecturers and generalists with leadership abilities as instructors. (6) At the end of each training period, each instructor should lead the students to work in the localities. The government should appoint each instructor as an administrative supervisory commissioner or county magistrate, according to the suitability of the person and the location, allowing them to find cadres among the students themselves and lead them to assume various tasks. Those former employees who lose their jobs due to the handover should continue to attend training classes. (7) When administrative supervisory commissioners or county magistrates arrive in the localities with their cadres, they should immediately mobilize local manpower to eliminate bandits, protect public security, and carry out production enterprises. Before undertaking the aforementioned enterprises, they should prepare detailed plans and submit them to the higher-level government for approval, responsible for carrying out the plans. In counties with representative bodies, they should obtain the consent of the representative bodies, and in pacification areas, they should coordinate with military needs. (8) Large cities should implement a rationing system based on certificates to prevent citizens from panic buying. The government should stabilize the market by adjusting the market with the materials it controls and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>4.  A proposal by Wu Gan and 88 others to promote the Economic Rationalization Law. This proposal argues that due to the impact of long-term inflation on the Chinese economy, various orders of production, exchange, and distribution have become extremely chaotic. In addition, the past errors in fiscal and financial policies have made the problems increasingly complex and serious. At the beginning of the establishment of the new currency, in order to correct these unreasonable phenomena and supplement the loopholes in the emergency financial and economic measures, to ensure the success of the new currency system, this "Economic Rationalization Ordinance" is proposed. The draft content is divided into five chapters: "General Provisions", "Fiscal Measures", "Secure Prices", "Channel Speculative Capital to Increase Production", and "Improve Financial Policy to Cooperate with the Comprehensive Economic Rationalization", with a total of 68 articles. The scope of the rationalization reform is very broad.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Area Economic Control Conference Opens in the Capital, Three Themes Discussed in Detail, Financial Management of Five Provinces and Cities Decided to be Strengthened</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The Economic Control Conference of three provinces and two cities convened by the Economic Control Supervisor of the Shanghai Area was held at the Central Bank in the capital at 3:00 PM on the 7th. Yu Hongjun presided over the meeting, and President Weng Wenhao also attended and delivered a speech, explaining the necessity of economic control and the need for close coordination and cooperation in the economic control work of the three provinces and two cities to achieve effective economic control. He hoped that effective measures would be studied to prevent the current phenomenon of material collection. After President Weng finished his speech, he spoke with Chen Qitian, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, in the venue for a short time before leaving. Then, Yu Hongjun and Jiang Jingguo respectively explained the main purpose of convening the economic control conference of three provinces and two cities. There are three themes discussed in the meeting: (1) Strengthen the economic control mechanism and contact methods in the Shanghai area; (2) Adjust the supply and demand of important materials in the area; and Strengthen the financial management of the five provinces and cities.

The three provinces and two cities will send members to participate. At the same time, the same agencies can also be established locally in the provinces and cities. In principle, the economic control work of the provinces and cities will still be responsible by the provincial and municipal governments, but the Shanghai Supervisor can send members to inspect various places at any time. At the same time, if necessary, inspectors can be sent to various places to carry out work to achieve familiarity. Regarding the second proposal, it was decided to hand it over to the subcommittee to hold a meeting in the capital on the morning of the 8th for review. Liu Gongyun, the person in charge of the Material Adjustment Committee, and Li Lixia will convene the meeting. The construction directors of the three provinces and the social bureau directors of the two cities will all attend. The decision of the subcommittee will be submitted to the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisor for approval before implementation. Regarding the third proposal, it was decided to strengthen the supervision and implementation at any time according to the powers of the Shanghai Economic Supervisor, and all staff can be transferred by the Shanghai Economic Supervisor at any time.

<h3>Draft Property Tax Regulations Passed with Amendments by the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee; State-Owned Enterprises Must Now Use Examinations for Hiring</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee convened a meeting on the morning of the 7th, chaired by Zhang Jingyu, to discuss the draft amendment to the Provisional Property Tax Regulations proposed by the preliminary review subcommittee. The draft was passed with amendments, the key differences from the original draft being threefold: (1) Property tax payments should be made in national currency as a general rule, but when insufficient, payments can be made with securities or in kind. (2) The tax threshold is set at 200,000 Gold Yuan or more, with a flat tax rate of 5%. A progressive tax system is adopted, reaching a maximum of 63% on the amount exceeding 20 million Gold Yuan. Those who fail to pay within the time limit stipulated in the regulations will be penalized 10% (originally 30%) of the unpaid tax amount per ten-day period, starting from the due date. If the delay exceeds three months, enforcement will be compulsory. Separately, the Joint Economic and Resources Committee, along with the Transportation, Education, and Culture Committees, also held a joint meeting in the morning to review the proposal by Liu Youchen and others that "all state-owned enterprises should, in accordance with the Constitution, promptly adopt a district-based examination system with provincial quotas for hiring, so that talent from all provinces have the opportunity to participate."

<h3>Four Joint Offices to Close; Applications for Loan Documents to Be Suspended Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Four Joint Offices held its 372nd board meeting on the morning of the 7th, chaired by President Weng. He first announced the Executive Yuan's decision on the 6th, based on the Legislative Yuan's resolution, to abolish the Four Joint Offices and close them by the end of October. Regarding the overall planning for financial management operations in the future, the Ministry of Finance should develop concrete measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. Weng continued, stating that the Four Joint Offices were established at the beginning of the War of Resistance to aggregate the strength of national banks, take unified steps, implement national policies, and assist production as its main tasks. In the future, relevant administrative and operational matters should be handled separately by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Subsequently, it was decided that the office would cease accepting applications for loan documents from October 8th. All outstanding loan cases will be transferred to the Central Bank for review and processing. Files and documents belonging to the administrative management section will be transferred to the Ministry of Finance for takeover, with the closure scheduled before the end of this month. Furthermore, the production loan policy for the future was also discussed at today's meeting. However, since the decision to abolish the Four Joint Offices has already been made, various principles and articles should be amended accordingly. It was decided to first have the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank jointly invite the heads of various banks, bureaus, and treasuries to discuss amendments before submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>Editorial: On the Battle of the Western Liaoning Corridor</h3>
<p>After the retreat from Jinan, the focus of the war shifted to the Western Liaoning Corridor. Attacking Western Liaoning is a strategy long planned by the Communist bandits. Their so-called "Autumn Offensive" aims to open the Western Liaoning Corridor, coordinate with the interior, and connect with the Shandong Peninsula. Defending Western Liaoning is a plan long established by the National Army. For months, the National Army has resolutely defended Changchun and Shenyang to contain Lin Biao and prevent him from moving south to Jinzhou and seizing Western Liaoning. This is a struggle for the gateway to the Northeast, and the fate of the entire Northeast depends on the success or failure in the Western Liaoning Corridor. According to a special dispatch from our newspaper in Shenyang, the Communist bandits are currently exerting all their strength to seize the Western Liaoning Corridor, forcing the National Army to fight to the death. The National Army is also intensifying its troop movements and has prepared a massive annihilation battle formation, vowing to completely collapse the bandit army. It is learned that the Communist bandits have deployed a total of five columns to attack Jinzhou and Jinxi, appearing to be launching a full-scale attack. On the National Army side, in addition to Fan Hanjie's corps, the Navy and Marine Corps have begun making emergency deployments in Huludao. There are also reports that the troops defending Changchun in isolation may break through and move south to reinforce Jinzhou. Judging from the situation, all forces are converging on Western Liaoning, and the focus of the overall war situation will completely shift here. This is something that deserves our deep attention.</p>
<p>In modern warfare, in terms of battles, the focus is on seizing key points and lines, not surfaces; in terms of strategy, the focus is on seizing gateways and ports. The National Army's past decline in the Northeast was due to its inability to secure surfaces while trying to defend lines and losing key points while trying to defend lines, seemingly trapping itself in a dead end. Fortunately, Western Liaoning is held, blocking Lin Biao's army. The resolute defense of Changchun and Shenyang has contained the bandit army's movements. While the National Army's defense of Changchun and Shenyang requires effort, the bandit army's inability to advance directly and even connect the railways demonstrates even greater effort. Therefore, the battle in the Northeast is entirely a war of attrition. Why wouldn't Lin Biao want to easily capture Changchun and Shenyang? It's just that he assessed his strength as insufficient and unwilling to pay a higher price. Why couldn't the National Army in Changchun and Shenyang shift from defense to offense? It's just that the time for a shift in the overall situation has not yet matured, requiring calm patience to observe the changes. In terms of the situation, the National Army holds the Western Liaoning Corridor, allowing Jinzhou to still echo Fanyang remotely, and Shenyang remains a supporting point for Changchun. If the strength in Western Liaoning increases, not only will the connection between Jinzhou and Shenyang become possible, but it may even be possible to revive the "dead piece" that is Changchun. Conversely, if the bandit army can occupy the Western Liaoning Corridor, it will not only complete the encirclement of Shenyang in the east but also be able to develop westward, gradually shrinking the encirclement of Pingjin. Therefore, the bandit army constantly wants to seize Jinzhou and its surrounding areas, trapping the National Army in Changchun and Shenyang in a situation where it cannot advance or retreat.</p>
<p>The Western Liaoning Corridor is the gateway to the Northeast and also the gateway to North China's interior and the ocean. The current Western Liaoning Corridor is threatened by Lushun and Dalian, resulting in a fragmented situation, but it has not yet reached the point of complete collapse. Why does the National Army insist on defending this fragmented situation and continues to invest fresh troops? Rather than saying it is to consolidate Changchun and Shenyang, it is more accurate to say it is to secure North China. This is determined by the geographical position of the Western Liaoning Corridor, forcing a change in dire circumstances. Gu Zuyu, in his book "Reading History and Geography," discussed the strategic importance of various regions, overlooking the Northeast and Northwest frontiers but placing particular emphasis on the Western Liaoning Corridor. This is determined by historical developments. Therefore, those who protect the world today must secure the Western Liaoning Corridor. Gu Zuyu analyzed the importance of the Western Liaoning Corridor, saying, "It controls and captures the Rong and He tribes, isolates the islands, relies on dangers and distance, and is sufficient to seal itself off. The Khitans occupied this area to harass China. The Jurchens also started their expansion here to destroy the Liao and weaken the Song. The Mongols took eastern and western Liaoning, and the Jurchens' foundation was destroyed. Since ancient times, those who have possessed Liaodong have often used it to encroach on You and Ji, causing disaster for the Central Plains." This shows that Western Liaoning is not only the gateway to the Northeast but also the gateway to North China's interior. The stage of fighting for lines and surfaces in the Northeast war has passed, and it has now reached the stage of fighting for key points and gateways. This war will not only determine the ultimate fate of the Northeast strategically but also have a significant impact on the situation in mainland North China.</p>
<p>The Northeast is the Northeast of the Republic of China, so the success or failure in the Northeast is of utmost importance to the fate of China. To resolutely defend Western Liaoning, secure North China, and thereby break through the Northeast, requires the effort of the entire nation. Therefore, the struggle in the Northeast is a struggle for the fate of the entire nation. We should pay attention to the battle of the Western Liaoning Corridor with a sense of urgency and consider how to fundamentally clarify the path for the Northeast. It is unacceptable to simply observe the gains and losses of one city or one area.</p>
<h3>Raymond P. Brandt and Others Arrive in Beiping, Meet Separately with Fu Zuoyi and the Ambassador; Yen Chia-kan Discusses Trip to the US with Reporters in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Raymond P. Brandt, Cleveland, Stuart, and Griffin arrived in Beiping from Qingdao at 1:00 PM on the 7th and immediately held separate meetings with Fu Zuoyi and Ambassador Stuart. Brandt is scheduled to return to the US next Sunday to report on the first phase of ECA's work in China. This trip to Beiping was to consult with the Ambassador before leaving China. Those who participated in the meeting between the Ambassador and Brandt at the US Consulate General at 6:30 PM included Griffin, Cleveland, and Stuart. Brandt is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 8th. In addition, White, commander of the US Navy's Western Pacific Fleet, arrived in Beiping with Brandt and others.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] Mr. Qu Lang, the US advisor to the Executive Yuan representing President Weng Wenhao, came to Shenyang a few days ago to inspect industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast. He left Shenyang for Beiping by plane on the afternoon of the 7th. Before his departure, Qu said that he would meet with Raymond P. Brandt and Ambassador Stuart in Beiping to provide concrete suggestions on the importance and difficulties of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Yen Chia-kan, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee, told reporters on the afternoon of the 7th that in addition to exchanging views with the ECA on relevant issues regarding US aid during his trip to the US, he also exchanged many views specifically on industrial parts and construction plans. The allocation of 70 million US dollars in special funds for industrial construction was also a topic of discussion. Among them, in addition to 35 million US dollars for industrial parts, another 35 million US dollars has been decided to be used in part for rural reconstruction, and the rest for construction and engineering design. Regarding the allocation of industrial parts, in addition to the more than ten institutions that have been successively agreed upon to receive industrial parts assistance, there are also some preliminary principles being discussed, which will be reviewed and announced successively after returning to China. For those that have been decided, funds will be allocated only after the engineering design is completed, and the actual amount of funds allocated will be based on the amount approved by the actual design. Yen went on to talk about the US's attitude towards aiding China, saying that at least economically, progress has been quite smooth, and its progress is definitely no less than that of any other European country receiving aid. As for the prospects for future aid, Yen said that the general sentiment in the US is that on the one hand, it hopes that China can help itself, and on the other hand, it also hopes to aid China. Therefore, before the next US Congress, it is hoped that China can make good use of US aid and also complete self-help plans. In the future, 30% of US aid to China will be in the hands of the US, and 70% will still be in the hands of China. At the same time, the US's understanding of China's crisis has also become more sufficient than before, so everything still depends on our country being able to do well for itself.</p>

<h3>New Turning Point in Atomic Energy Dispute, Six Countries to Reopen Negotiations, Political Committee Passes New Zealand Proposal, Subcommittee Established to Draft Resolution</h3>
<p>[News Report] Paris, 7th (Broadcast): A new turning point was reached on the 7th regarding the dispute over atomic energy control. The Soviet Union proposed to restart negotiations on atomic energy control. At the same time, the Western powers changed their attitude and agreed to spend at least another year seeking a satisfactory solution. Previously, the New Zealand representative suggested to the Political Committee that the five major powers, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and France, and Canada reopen negotiations to seek a satisfactory solution for international control of atomic energy, which was supported by the US representative. According to the New Zealand proposal, a subcommittee composed of the five major powers and Canada will be organized to study whether an agreement on atomic energy control is possible between the East and the West. Some representatives believe that reorganizing the subcommittee will invalidate the work of the Atomic Energy Commission for the past two years and start from scratch. The Soviet representative Malik disagreed, arguing that reopening negotiations could lead to satisfactory results. The Ukrainian representative also advocated for a new discussion to seek a comprehensive agreement. The Western representatives abandoned their proposal to end negotiations with the Soviet Union on atomic energy. The Canadian representative suggested that the two-year atomic energy negotiations, which had yielded no results, be completely stopped and requested the Political Committee to submit the US control plan to the UN General Assembly for approval. The subcommittee organized according to the New Zealand proposal will re-examine the atomic energy issue, decide whether and when the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission should resume work, and consider the Soviet Union's proposal at this General Assembly, namely, to simultaneously ban atomic bombs and establish an international control organization. The New Zealand representative suggested (1) request the six permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission to discuss whether there is a basis for reaching an agreement on international control; (2) when a basis is found, suggest that the six-nation subcommittee reopen the Atomic Energy Commission meeting; (3) order the six permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission to report the results of the discussions to the 1949 General Assembly. Finally, the Political Committee submitted the case to a vote. As a result, the organization of the subcommittee was passed with 47 votes to 0 (5 abstentions) to review various suggestions related to atomic energy and draft a resolution for submission to the General Assembly for approval.</p>

At the same time, regarding the wage increase issue between electricity, lighting, and gas workers and employers, the two sides have not been able to reach an agreement that is sufficient to resolve the problem. Therefore, workers in these areas, plus workers in the post office and public utilities, are also likely to strike.</p>
<h3>Two Factions of Laborers Clash</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 6th] Communists and non-Communists clashed in the striking mining areas on the 6th. At the same time, labor disputes are spreading to state-owned railways and docks, further paralyzing France's already crippled industry. In the Faubourg mining area in the west, mobile guards quelled an attempt by 600 workers, mostly women, to march to the city hall, and beatings occurred. In the town of Cenave, in the Maubeuge district in the north, a small clash occurred when non-Communist workers attempted to cross the picket lines of the Communist trade union.</p>
<h3>Philippine Finance Minister Opposes US Aid to Japan's Recovery at Far East Trade Conference; Chinese Representative Hopes Japanese Goods Will Not Flood the Chinese Market</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] Walter S. Robertson, Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs of the US State Department, stated this morning at the Far East and India Trade Conference that the greatest threat to the situation in Asia today is the organized nature of the Communist Party, which is creating political turmoil. He pointed out that since the victory over Japan, the political currents and vacuums in the Far East have made the situation in Asia extremely volatile and unpredictable. Liu Dachun, Commercial Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the United States, also delivered a speech. Before adjourning this morning, the Far East and India Trade Conference raised the issue of Japan's industrial recovery and its ultimate impact on China and Africa. Mr. Lee, Director of the Far East Division of the US Department of Commerce, expressed the US's view on the above issue, stating that in order to relieve the burden on US taxpayers, Japan's industrial machinery must effectively recover to pre-war standards, and arrangements must be made between Japan, the United States, and other Asian countries to ensure that Japan regains economic security, maintains friendly relations with all countries, and does not fall into the "Soviet embrace." Liu Dachun expressed China's view, stating that China does not oppose Japan's economic recovery, but it must be conditional on Japanese cheap products no longer flooding the Chinese market. The Philippine Finance Minister criticized the US for assisting Japan in regaining its economic power, arguing that the premature realization of Japan's economic recovery would have an adverse impact on the development of the Philippine post-war industry.</p>

The resolutions on major cases and the results of the re-election are as follows: (A) Budget Committee: (1) The Municipal Government's letter requesting review of the revised general budget for income and expenditure for September to December 1948 was submitted for discussion.

<h3>Fire on Fuxing East Road: Multiple Houses Destroyed; Impacting the Water and Wood Industry Welfare Association; Loss of Over 700 Dan of White Rice</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 6:15 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out at the Shengtailai Clothing Store at 325 Fuxing East Road (intersection of Zhonghua Road). A apprentice, Xu Renxing, was cooking breakfast when he went out to chop firewood, and the firewood in the stove fell into a pile of rags, causing a fire. The shops in the area were all made of wooden boards and bamboo fences, so the fire spread quickly. The Nanshi Fire Brigade arrived and made every effort to extinguish the fire. It took more than an hour to put out the fire completely. In addition to the complete destruction of the Shengtailai Clothing Store, the fire also spread to the neighboring Hexing Roundwork at 327, the Yuantongxing Laundry at 321 and 323, and the Zhenwu Tobacco and Wine Store at 315. The most severely damaged was the Water and Wood Industry Welfare Association at 317 and 319. Workers' rationed goods stored in the three buildings behind, including 2,000 dozen towels, over 700 dan of white rice, and over 30 application materials, were all burned or damaged by water, resulting in heavy losses. Afterwards, the fire starter Xu Liansheng fled without a trace. The apprentice Xu Renxing who caused the accident and the housewife Xu Zhang Wenqin were both taken to the Yimiao Police Branch for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ticket Scalpers' Skills Exhausted; Order Restored in Stores; New Fashion Goods 50% Higher</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the authorities issued an order requiring the presentation of a national identification card of this city to purchase retail goods and restricted the quantity of purchases, the "ticket scalpers'" skills have been exhausted, and the trend of panic buying has also weakened. Most stores are now organizing their inventory and continuing to supply retail sales as usual in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, so order has returned to normal. However, fashion stores had the best business during this round of panic buying, and almost all of their inventory of wool fabrics was sold out. As a result, the current prices of new goods in the industry are quite expensive, generally about 50% higher than the "August 19th" prices. For example, a long-haired velvet women's coat that sold for 120 yuan two weeks ago now sells for 180 yuan. Other fur goods are even more expensive. The cheapest yellow wolf fur coat costs 1,500 yuan, an otter fur coat costs about 3,000 yuan, and a gray-backed coat costs at least 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Holds Emergency Meeting; Once Causing Fierce Dispute; Agreed on Quotas for Procuring Food; Wan Molin in Charge of 15,000 Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of rice supply, Supervisor Jiang summoned Wan Molin, Chairman of the Rice Industry Association, and Yin Fuxiang and Xu Songren, the persons in charge of the North and South markets, the day before yesterday, ordering them to guarantee a monthly supply of 250,000 dan of rice to the city. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Rice Industry Association convened an emergency industry meeting at the South Market to discuss how to effectively procure the rice. Most of the rice merchants who attended the meeting stated that they should comply with the order to procure and transport rice for the country's people. However, there was a fierce dispute over the allocation of responsibilities. The board of directors initially proposed that each rice store be responsible for procuring 60 dan of rice per month. With over 2,000 rice stores in the city, the total could reach 150,000 dan. The remaining 100,000 dan would be borne by rice mills and distributors, totaling about 300 to 400 households. However, the rice stores, due to their small capital and traditionally retail nature, do not directly procure rice. They have recently made efforts to directly purchase from the production areas to help solve the food problem. Now, the allocation of responsibilities is more than that of the rice mills and distributors with strong capital, which is considered extremely unfair, and they have spoken out and argued. Later, at the suggestion of an official from the Bureau of Social Affairs, representatives from rice mills, distributors, and rice stores discussed and negotiated, and finally decided on the following allocation of responsibilities: Rice mills are responsible for procuring 105,000 dan of rice per month, rice mills are responsible for 45,000 dan per month, distributors are responsible for 30,000 dan per month, and rice stores are responsible for 55,000 dan per month. Chairman Wan Molin is also personally responsible for 15,000 dan, for a total of 250,000 dan. If there are practical difficulties during procurement and transportation, they should report to Supervisor Jiang for assistance in solving them. Also, no rice arrived at the North Market yesterday, and about 400 dan of goods arrived at the South Market.</p>
<h3>Prosecution of Sun Yuankui and Others for Setting Up Private Radio Station for Profit</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Sun Yuankui from Rugao, starting in April of this year, colluded with Wu Liangzhi from Taizhou and Hu Zhongmin from Zhuji to set up a private radio station in a shack at 1237 Jujiazui Road. They reported commercial information on cotton yarn and grain to Nantong, Taixian, Rugao, and Qidong daily, charging merchants for radio fees for profit. Sun was responsible for maintenance, Wu was responsible for receiving and sending messages, Hu was responsible for liaison, and Zhang Xisheng, who delivered newspapers, was responsible for sending messages. Another resident of Zhenhai, Wu Zhaorui, assisted from the side. The profits were divided as follows: Sun and Wu received 35% each, Hu received 35% alone, and Zhang received 30%. The police bureau received a report and went to arrest them at 7:00 p.m. on the 3rd of last month, confiscating three-lamp radio receivers and other equipment. The thousand suspects were handed over to the Songhu Garrison Command. After questioning, it was clarified that Sun and others did not have military status or pro-Communist suspicions, so they were transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. It is learned that the investigation by the District Attorney's Office has concluded, and Sun and others have been prosecuted according to law for the crime of setting up a private radio station.</p>
<h3>"Floating Sickness," "Herd Mentality," "Hedonistic Mania": Abnormal Psychology Creates Distorted Social Phenomena; Shanghai People Seek Their Own Troubles</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The panic buying trend in various places has gradually eased yesterday. Looking at the so-called "panic buying queues" in front of various stores in the past few days, a little analysis reveals that the general public is psychologically infected with "floating sickness." This social disease is what the managing authorities should pay attention to in the future and should develop appropriate countermeasures. In the so-called "panic buying queues," in addition to a portion of "ticket scalpers" intending to profit from the opportunity, most citizens do not urgently need the materials they want to buy, such as wool fabrics. The consumption quantity in a middle-class family is originally very limited. The reason for over-purchasing and storing this time, and even withdrawing deposits that have been deposited in the bank (according to the reporter's investigation, more than 70% of these deposits are new accounts opened after August 19th, and seem to be the surplus funds obtained after exchanging old gold bills), is because they are misled by what others say. Often, a household in a certain neighborhood returns from shopping and tells people that the price of a certain material is extremely cheap, and that stores will soon be out of stock and may not be able to buy it this winter. Then, they tell each other, even though it has no basis, the rumors spread and evolve into reason. The households in the same neighborhood then rush to compete for purchases.</p>
<p>This psychological floating phenomenon is especially easy to see in the queues. The reporter personally saw several housewives lining up in front of a woolen thread store in the early morning. Because they could not stand the crowding and waiting for a long time, they withdrew one after another, and frequently said, "We can always buy it in the future." It can be seen that they originally had no predetermined plan, and it is also sufficient to prove the harm of the "herd mentality" in Shanghai society.</p>
<p>In terms of the entertainment industry, the "floating sickness" has also been fully demonstrated in recent weeks: cinemas and theaters are thriving, and even second and third-run cinemas showing old films are often full. There are no vacant seats in the dance halls, and it is almost impossible to turn around in the dance floor. The scenic cities near this city are filled with "Shanghai guests," and the occupancy rate of each hotel has increased tenfold. The reason for this is still that the general former speculators are initiating it. Since various markets are controlled and there is no place to use force, they are unwilling to invest their idle funds in production, so they call friends and associates to enjoy themselves. As the trend spreads, relatives and subordinates slightly related to them feel that it is time to enjoy themselves. As a result of the psychological floating, the entertainment industry has experienced unprecedented prosperity.</p>
<p>Because dance halls are often full and there are not enough seats, some dancers eat inside after the tea dance time is over, waiting for the evening session to start, and always stay there for fear of losing their seats. Other smaller dance halls, which usually lack the patronage of wealthy guests, have rows of cars parked in front of them recently, which is already a common sight. According to most dancers, their services have also been in short supply recently, and their income has increased sharply. Those with more mediocre looks have also increased their daily income several times compared to before. Although the authorities have repeatedly stipulated that dancers must purchase dance tickets to pay dance fees, almost all transactions are now done in cash, especially during tea dance time. The dance halls claim that their business is not as prosperous as rumored, and that the small number of dance tickets is the biggest reason they cite.</p>
<p>In addition, the "floating sickness" is most clearly expressed in restaurants and eateries. After the last decision to refuse to purchase black market vegetables, more valuable items such as chicken, fins, and ginseng have gradually decreased in supply, but there are still wealthy customers who make reservations with restaurants, asking them to find ways to purchase them at black market prices, only to ensure that the dishes are exquisite, and they are willing to pay at black market prices. It is considered a miracle that restaurants and eateries in the city cannot be full every day. According to waiters, diners have recently been particularly fond of hiring prostitutes to serve wine. When asked about the prostitute houses, they also admitted that "hall assignments" have increased sharply in the past month, and customers book an average of 600 yuan per table every day. According to their observations, many customers recently seem to have a "hedonistic mania," which is actually rooted in the "floating sickness." How to calm this disease is a major task for the managing authorities in guiding social and economic order.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Manufacture Artificial Diamonds and Defraud $20,000 USD; Two Soviet Suspects Arrested in Tianjin and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Karl Hoff, a stateless diamond merchant currently residing in Room 917 of the International Hotel, was recently defrauded of a substantial sum of $20,000 USD by his Soviet friend, Baoliya Gaofu, in collusion with Jidisi (formerly a chemist), an employee of the Soviet International Refugee Office, under the pretext of testing artificial diamonds. Hoff promptly reported the incident to the police, and Zhu Mengwei and Tao Genrong, section chiefs of the Criminal Investigation Department, launched an investigation. They successively apprehended Ji and Bao at Room 11, No. 195 Changde Road, and No. 38 Datong Road in Tianjin. After thorough interrogation, both confessed to the crime. They are scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today. The case unfolded as follows: Bao and Ji, claiming to be able to manufacture artificial diamonds, solicited $20,000 USD from Hoff as an experiment fee. In the laboratory, they seized an opportunity when Hoff was not paying attention and switched his bag of cash with a fake paper package. They then pretended to accidentally burn it to ashes with a chemical liquid. Afterwards, Bao and Ji feigned a quarrel. Finally, Bao pretended to agree to compensate $10,000 USD and scheduled a meeting at the Didisi Cafe the next day to hand over the money. However, they disappeared without a trace on the appointed day. Only then did Hoff realize he had been deceived and reported the matter to the police, leading to the eventual resolution of the case.</p>
<h3>Health Exhibition to Open on Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Health Exhibition, organized by the Municipal Health Bureau, is now ready and will grandly open on Double Tenth Day (October 10th) at Aurora University on Chongqing South Road.

<h3>Proposal to Construct a Dedicated Warehouse for Dangerous Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a spokesperson for the Municipal Warehouse Industry Association, regarding the storage of dangerous goods in warehouses, although the authorities have taken active preventative measures since the Zhongsheng Warehouse fire, ordering the relocation of dangerous goods to suburban warehouses, the warehouses in the city are concentrated in the central district. Even if the dangerous goods are ordered to be moved, the result is that they remain within the central district. Furthermore, the frequent relocation of dangerous goods increases the risk. Recognizing this, the association has petitioned the Municipal Government, suggesting that the city allocate public land to construct a dedicated warehouse for the storage of dangerous goods. The construction cost would be partially loaned by the municipal bank, with the remaining half raised by the association through inviting merchants to subscribe to shares. It is reported that the authorities are sympathetic to this proposal and are considering it.</p>
<h3>Brewers Illegally Procuring Broken Rice Prosecuted After Being Intercepted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Lu Qizhong and Yang Jugen, winemakers from Wuxi, transported over eighty containers of homemade spirits to Shanghai in September of this year and sold them to Cheng Linsheng, the owner of the Tongtaiyuan Wine and Rice Store. They agreed to exchange the spirits for rice. Cheng then successively purchased over two hundred dan (a unit of weight) of broken rice obtained by deducting and reselling allocated rice for food rations from the rice stores of Xu Rongsheng, Tang Jibin, Luo Puzhang, Huang Side, Chen Jinchu, Gong Hongxing, Cui Yao, Zhao Xiaobo, Wu Dianwen, and others. The broken rice was used to offset the payment for the spirits. Subsequently, they hired a boat to transport all the rice back to Wuxi. However, they were intercepted by the Yangjing Police Sub-bureau.

<h3>Military Drama Erupts on Streetcar: Several Air Force Officers Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 8:10 PM last night, five or six Air Force 20th Brigade, 2nd Squadron officers, including lieutenants and second lieutenants, accompanied by several female companions, boarded streetcar No. 193 on Route 1 from the Gongyuan Bazichang (park shooting range), intending to get off at the Bund on Nanjing Road. However, upon reaching their destination, they forgot to disembark. When the streetcar passed the station and continued moving, they ordered the driver to stop. At that time, conductor Chen Zhiqing, No. 2474, rang the bell to open the door but grumbled, causing one of the last Air Force officers to snatch his ticket board. Chen immediately pursued, intending to retrieve it. Driver Xu Hongchun, No. 281, also rushed up to help, assisting in demanding it back. During the commotion, Xu was slapped twice in the face, and a gunshot was heard amidst the chaos. At that moment, streetcars on Routes 1, 2, 7, 8, etc., arriving one after another, all came to a halt. The incident caused a standstill from the Bund along Nanjing Road to Henan Road, and as far as Yangjingbang, involving over fifty streetcars. Conductors and drivers from various streetcars swarmed to the scene. As a result, several Air Force officers were injured in the brawl, including Yan Kairen, Wu Pengnian, Ma Shiquan, and Yun Hang. In addition, a soldier of the Northeast Military Region Citizens' Team, wearing a yellow uniform, who was watching from the sidelines, was mistakenly identified as an Air Force member and suffered severe chest and abdominal injuries, coughing up blood. Upon receiving the report, military and police authorities dispatched Yan Zi, the first battalion commander of the Garrison Command, and his personnel to the scene. Feng, the Huangpu Branch Bureau Chief, along with Section Chief Li, also arrived and urgently summoned ambulances to transport the injured officers to hospitals such as Gongji and Renji. Driver Xu Hongchun, conductor Chen Zhiqing, and others were taken to the Huangpu Branch Bureau. The Garrison Command's Commander Yan, together with police officers and Air Force investigators, interrogated them to ascertain the cause of the incident, which took approximately two hours. Simultaneously, they worked diligently to restore traffic. By 11 PM, streetcars on all routes resumed normal operation. The assault incident is currently being handled impartially.</p>
<h3>In the Case of Assaulting the Wife of a National Representative, Li Xiaohou's Testimony is Extremely Vague, and He Asked to Review the Record for a Long Time Before Being Returned to Custody</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the case of Min Binru, the wife of Wang Guanying, a National Representative from Jiangxi residing in this city, who was violently attacked with an iron pipe by Li Xiaohou (also known as Li Chongguang) at her residence on the morning of August 8th of this year, the District Prosecutor's Office previously prosecuted Li on charges of assault and attempted murder. The District Court held its initial hearing yesterday morning. The defendant, Li Xiaohou, wore a gray wool suit, did not tie his tie, and appeared emaciated. Before the interrogation, he repeatedly stated that the relationship between him, Wang Guanying, Min Binru, and her sister-in-law was extremely complicated. He stated that he was currently collecting evidence from various sources and requested the court to postpone the trial, which the court denied.</p>
<p>According to Li's testimony, he is currently 38 years old. He met Wang Guanying in Chongqing in 1944. After the victory, he came to Shanghai. Due to many complicated reasons, he had no choice but to reside at Wang's home. Min's younger sister-in-law also lived in another house in Wang's residence. After Min's husband left Shanghai for Nanjing, she often used excuses to talk to him, and he tried his best to avoid getting close to her. On the evening of August 7th (the night before the incident), he entertained a friend who had just returned from the United States and returned to his residence very late. Upon arriving, he saw Min and a tenant named Wang talking in the pavilion. Min told him that Mrs. Wang was willing to pay for his expenses for entertaining his friend. He immediately declined. He then took off his shirt and trousers and went outside to cool off. When he returned to the room to sleep, Min's sister-in-law suddenly entered and requested to speak with him on Min's behalf. At this point, the court considered that his testimony seemed to have no direct relationship to the fact that he plotted to harm Min Binru, and the complicated relationship he mentioned was also extremely vague. The court then asked him if he had any mental illness, to which he firmly replied "No." He continued to testify that Min was the first to attack, and he retaliated with an iron pipe, with absolutely no intention of killing her. As for the prosecutor's indictment that he often issued bad checks, causing Min to constantly satirize him, leading him to harbor resentment and commit the assault, he claimed that it was Min's post-event embellishment and not the truth. Subsequently, neither the plaintiff, Min Binru, nor the witness, Wang Guanying, appeared. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing. Before being returned to custody, the defendant requested to review the clerk's record of his testimony in court, which he did for a long time before leaving.</p>

<h3>Method for the Payment of Principal and Interest on the 1947 U.S. Dollar Bonds; Principal and Interest on Bonds Should Be Deposited in the Central Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures, inquiries have been made regarding any changes in the method for paying principal and interest on the 1947 U.S. Dollar Bonds, as well as the following questions: (1) Whether holders of special coupons for principal and interest that have matured but not yet been paid can still receive U.S. dollars without restrictions during the effective period. (2) Whether holders of the aforementioned principal and interest coupons can exchange them for Gold Yuan and have the managing bank issue a U.S. dollar draft payable to the Central Bank, which the coupon holder can then sell to the Central Bank. (3) How to pay the principal and interest due at the end of September of this year. The managing bank has submitted these questions to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation. The Ministry of Finance has submitted the following instructions to the Executive Yuan for approval:</p>
<p>(1) Principal and interest on the bonds that have matured but not yet been paid before August 19th of this year should still be paid in U.S. dollars during the effective period. However, the foreign exchange obtained by the bond's special coupon holder should be exchanged by the managing bank for a U.S. dollar draft payable to the Central Bank, which the coupon holder deposits into the Central Bank or its authorized bank, and then utilized according to the "Central Bank's Regulations on the Payment of Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Deposits."</p>
<p>(2) Whether the holders of these bonds are domestic or foreign, if they wish to exchange the matured principal and interest for Gold Yuan, they can all sell the U.S. dollar drafts issued by the managing bank to the Central Bank to exchange for Gold Yuan, and the service fee will be waived.</p>
<p>(3) The principal and interest due at the end of September of this year and thereafter will be handled in accordance with the above two provisions.</p>
<p>Regarding the above points, the Central Bank has informed all its branches and offices to investigate and implement them in accordance with the instructions from the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Rice Arrivals Slightly Increased; Oil Market Temporarily Suspended Yesterday by Order</h3>
<p>The arrival of rice increased slightly yesterday, totaling 453 shi (a unit of volume) and 5 dou (a smaller unit of volume), all arriving at the Nanshi market. The arrival in the Beishi market remained at zero. The majority of the arrivals in the Nanshi market were indica rice, with 30 shi of white japonica rice. Sales were conducted at the limited price, but there was too much demand and not enough supply, making it difficult to purchase. Transactions were virtually at a standstill. Because there were no arrivals in the Beishi market, it remained closed.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market remained suspended. Although retailers received allocations from factories, it was not enough to meet demand.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>There were slight transactions in the sluggish market. Over 100 packages of Poyang yellow soybeans opened at a price of 13.8 yuan. Over 300 packages of Poyang black soybeans were acquired by oil factories, opening at 12 yuan. Over 200 packages of sesame seeds were traded. Over 100 packages of raw kernels opened, mostly ungraded.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The market was ordered to temporarily suspend trading yesterday. Businesses still gathered as usual, so the first day of the suspension did not seem deserted. Most people left after idle talk. Retailers on this street are waiting for allocation to meet market demand.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Softens</h3>
<p>The sugar market trended weaker yesterday. Supply exceeded demand, and morale was scattered. To thoroughly implement the limited price, the association will adopt a distribution method for free trading. As a result, businesses rushed to sell, but the appetite on this street was still strong, and sales were not weak. The market closed softer and then leveled off. The 22nd-period sugar white remained unopened. The 20th-period middle sugar, the native factory cotton white, slightly rose by one jiao (a tenth of a yuan). The remaining transactions were conducted according to the limit, and the price remained unchanged. Xinghua white, Gaozhang red, and Hainan red were abundant in the market, but the appetite was not strong, and the market situation saw further contraction.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Industry Requests Interest Increase</h3>
<p>The Pawnshop Industry Association, because the authorities reduced the interest rate to 1.3 fen (a hundredth of a yuan) per month, dispatched representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to petition for an increase. The Social Affairs Bureau considered that 1.3 fen per month was not too low and planned to further reduce it. Regarding the maintenance of the pawnshop industry, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene relevant agencies to discuss the possibility of obtaining loans from the municipal bank in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Insurance Industry Association Discusses Increasing Capital</h3>
<p>The Insurance Industry Association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, presided over by Chairman Luo Beichen.

(2) All foreign exchange of the industry should be transferred to the national bank in accordance with government regulations, but hoping that the national bank would not freeze the industry's application for use. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Quiet; Silk Fabrics Still Popular</h3>
<p>The source of raw silk is becoming increasingly scarce, transactions are sluggish, and the market situation is dull. Silk companies are requesting the China Trust Bureau to allocate silk, but the result of the negotiations has not been permitted, and morale is quite uneasy. The amount of stock entrusted by the association for distribution is also decreasing daily. The daily limit of 100 packages for distribution was still fully subscribed yesterday. Due to the strong sales of silk fabrics in recent days, morale is firm, and the appetite of the silk weaving industry is not weak. However, businesses are very reluctant to sell, and transactions have turned cold. No transactions have been heard in the industry.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics are still selling well in the market, and the market situation is sharp. Demand for the latest patterned goods is still strong, morale is buoyant, and current goods in the market are extremely scarce.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Transactions Shift Location</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn and cotton cloth markets continue to be closed, and news is quiet. However, the general cloth businesses have lost their point of transaction. The Leyuan Teahouse on Jiujiang Road in this city has a cotton cloth tea party, which is small in scale and a place for piecemeal cloth trading. Since the closure of the cloth market, the transactions at the tea party have suddenly become lively. The prices are still within the limit, hovering on the limit line. In addition, the textile construction company distributed cloth as usual yesterday.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Industry Exchange Margin; Half to Be Paid Before Capital Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Representatives from the National Money Exchange Industry Association, Qin Runqing, Shen Rixin, Wang Yizhai, and over ten others, went to the Central Bank yesterday morning to petition. They were received by Deputy Director Li of the Business Bureau. The representatives unanimously requested that the exchange margin be paid according to the situation in various regions after the completion of the capital increase. They also requested that the Central Bank notify the local central banks not to refuse legal currency remittances before the specified deadline. Deputy Director Li said that the exchange margin has been approved to be paid half before the capital increase, and the remaining 50% will be collected after the capital increase. He will issue a circular to all branches to comply with the rule that legal currency remittances must not be refused after the November 20th deadline.</p>
<p>Request to Reduce the Amount of Capital Increase</p>
<p>In addition, the representatives from various regions will go to Nanjing tomorrow to petition the Ministry of Finance, requesting a reduction in the amount of capital increase and extending the deadline to six months, so that the cash portion of the capital increase will not be frozen, and the deposit interest rate will not be forcibly lowered. According to Qin Runqing, the capital increase standard is too high and cannot be borne by ordinary businesses, and there are also practical difficulties in merging operations. In terms of deposits, although the book value has increased, they are all floating and unstable, making it difficult to plan their use. Moreover, due to the current rush to purchase goods, deposits have decreased.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Reporting Student Records; Ministry of Education Order Prompting Relevant Matters for Junior College and Above Schools; Student Numbers as Data for Next Year's Budget</h3>
<p>[From Our Correspondent in Nanjing on the 7th] The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 7th to all junior colleges and above, stating: The dates, procedures, and form formats for new students, transfer students, and graduates are detailed in the Student Record Regulations. The previously issued forms to be reported by affiliated agencies and schools also had additional regulations. On June 10th of this year, the Higher Education Department of the Ministry also issued a circular for printing. Now that the 1948 academic year has begun, the following matters related to the reporting of student records by schools are hereby re-emphasized: (1) The student number table for each department, subject, and group must be reported to the Ministry within ten days after the registration deadline of each semester. If there are any changes in the student number after reporting to the Ministry, a supplementary report can be made. When the Ministry compiles the budgets of various schools for the coming year, this type of report will be important data. (2) The name lists of new students, transfer students, graduate students, special students, and special students who have become regular students, since the 1948 academic year, should be written in ink in duplicate. After being reported to the Ministry for review, the original will be kept by the Ministry, and the duplicate will be returned to the original school for preservation to save procedures and speed up efficiency. (3) The name lists of new students, transfer students, graduate students, and special students should be reported to the Ministry within two months after the start of the semester, and the name list of graduates should be reported to the Ministry within three months after the graduation examination is completed. When reporting, the names of all new students (or graduates) in that semester should be listed in full. If the admission documents of new students are not complete, they can be reported in batches later to avoid hindering the early approval of the records of most students due to a few students whose documents are incomplete. When making a supplementary report, a name list should still be sent in duplicate, stating the year and numbering the name list according to the order of reporting to the Ministry (i.e., the first report to the Ministry is Name List No. 1, the second supplementary report is Name List No. 2, and so on) for easy reference. (4) Supplementary reports on the admission documents of new students or supplementary reports on the qualifications of graduates should be listed in separate volumes according to the year and reported as special cases. Also, the previous case number and the date of the Ministry's reply should be filled in detail. Students with the same academic year and semester should be compiled into one volume each month for reporting, and it is not advisable to report one document per student to save manpower and resources. (5) The size and items of each name list must comply with the regulations and be printed in accordance with the format attached to the letter issued by the Higher Education Department of the Ministry on June 10th of this year. (6) A reporting number should be compiled separately for the names of new students and graduates according to the year. When replying later, the original number should still be indicated in the name list. (7) The admission documents and photos of new students and transfer students should be separately bound into volumes, along with the statistical table and the name list of new students and transfer students, and reported together. The past academic results, photo albums, statistical tables, and graduation certificates of graduates should be reported together with the name list of graduates.</p>
<h3>Judicial Graduation Examination; Results Announced for the First Time Within Days</h3>

<p>[From Our Correspondent in Hankou, 7th] Hu Shi and Li Ji flew to Nanjing together at 9 AM this morning. The two gentlemen gave three public lectures in Hankou, which greatly guided the academic atmosphere in Wuhan. Hu's speech implied political meaning more than academic meaning, which inevitably surprised people, but his hint that the countercurrents of anti-democracy and anti-freedom would eventually be overwhelmed by the mainstream of the times was still praised by most intellectual youths. The two gentlemen did not stay here for long due to attending the establishment of the China Asian Relations Association in Nanjing on the 8th.</p>

<h3>First Basketball Game of the New Season: Mixed Team Narrowly Defeats Warrior Team, Sixty-One to Sixty, a One-Point Difference, the Entire Game Thrilling, Tense, and Spectacular</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The first basketball game of the new autumn season, a basketball exhibition game hosted by the Municipal Sports Reporters Association, featuring the Warrior team versus the Mixed team, was held yesterday at 7:00 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. It was a grand and enthusiastic event, filled with tension and excitement. In the end, the Mixed team came from behind in the final minutes to narrowly defeat the Warrior team by a score of sixty-one to sixty, a one-point victory. In the first half, the Warrior team led by twenty-eight to twenty-four, a lead of two baskets. The game was extraordinarily thrilling, and the audience of over a thousand was in high spirits. During halftime, Miss Chen Meizhen, a representative of the Association, presented each team with a Ginza, a gift from Mr. Ji Zhizhong, a patron of sports, as a memento. Referees were Liu Hesheng and Xuan Zhijie.</p>
<p>Warrior Team Takes the Lead</p>
<p>The Warrior team is a rising force, initially fielding players such as Zhi Ji, Yongfang, Fuhai, Baokang, Zhang Pu, and Linzhen. The Mixed team, a joint force from the Hualian and Chenyou teams, initially fielded Fushen, Chengzhang, Zhenzhong, and Bingfu. The first half saw back-and-forth action, with the score differing by only one point at times, and ties occurring as many as four times, highlighting the tension of the game. Later, Zhenzhong of the Mixed team was substituted, and Jin Gu Jianjiang, Fu Jinsheng, entered the game. Xiangcheng took his place, and the battle became even more intense. The Warrior team gradually took the lead, with the first half ending at twenty-eight to twenty-four, the Warrior team ahead by two baskets.</p>
<p>One-Point Defeat</p>
<p>In the second half, after a break, the battle resumed, with the Chenyou players taking the lead. The Warrior team's momentum surged, with star player Cao Zhiji particularly active, driving straight into the opponent's territory. Fushen, Xiangcheng, and Jinsheng worked together, and the Warrior team led by as many as fifteen points, with a score of fifty-six to forty-three. However, the situation soon changed dramatically, and the Mixed team made a series of successful shots, staging a comeback. They ultimately won by a score of sixty-one to sixty, a reversal of fortune. It was a pity that the Warrior team could not hold onto their lead.</p>
<p>The Sports Reporters Association would like to express its deep gratitude to the Basketball Committee, the Gymnasium, the Hualian, Warrior, and Chenyou teams, as well as the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, the Xiexing Sports Equipment Factory, and the Siwei Boy Scouts for their enthusiastic support of this exhibition game.

<h3>Résumé</h3>
<p>— Mingxu</p>
<p>Just finished dinner, leaning back on the sofa chatting with my family, when my wife seemed to remember something. She suddenly got up, took a piece of paper from under the glass of her dresser, walked over, and told me:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Cheng just came by. She said that her eldest son, who just graduated from university this year, is looking for a job. She's begging you to help him out."</p>
<p>The piece of paper in her hand was naturally the résumé of that young Master Cheng. It was filled with pretentious, affected penmanship, which they say is called "flourishing style." But to us old-fashioned folks, it just looked like every character was leaning and tilting, like dancing the jitterbug.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll see if there's an opportunity," I replied, casually placing the résumé on the tea table.</p>
<p>Honestly, I already felt a sense of dislike when I saw that handwriting. Even if there were a position opening up in my department, I wouldn't want to bring in someone like that. Official documents filled with tilted, illegible characters? What kind of system is that!</p>
<p>I took a puff of my cigarette and couldn't help blurting out:</p>
<p>"Is that kind of strange handwriting what university graduates write these days!"</p>
<p>My wife laughed. "I think most university students write like that now. Are universities supposed to force students to practice calligraphy?"</p>
<p>I thought about it. A few days ago, a friend who works at a certain national bank mentioned that his department was looking to hire someone who could draft documents, with beautiful and energetic handwriting. But after searching for several months, they had to settle for an old gentleman over sixty. They had also recruited university graduates several times, but none of them qualified.</p>
<p>Today, the disconnect between university education and reality is something everyone knows. People who study Western literature in university, finding work as English teachers in middle school seems to be using what they've learned. But before they become good teachers, they've probably already forgotten all the Chaucer, Milton, Molière, Schiller... etc., that they studied so diligently in university, and instead, they're picking up Nesfield's grammar again, memorizing those definitions and rules. People who graduate from Chinese literature programs and become secretaries in organizations are also considered to be "doing relevant work." But looking at the current university curriculum, they may have some research on the Songs of Chu or the Book of Changes, understanding a bit about the evolution of characters and sounds; however, if you ask them to handle a fairly complex document, there's an eighty or ninety percent chance they won't be able to figure it out. And if you ask them to manage archives, the task seems easy, but you still need a meticulous and quick mind to quickly categorize items. For example, the national bank I mentioned above is very large, but its archives are extremely disorganized. Sometimes, trying to find an old case from just half a month ago can take two or three days – or it might not be found at all. The bank authorities are well aware of this. They certainly want to rejuvenate the workforce and add some smart, capable, and energetic young people. But these skills are precisely what universities disdain to teach! So, those so-called "old hands" who exude a musty air become treasures in various organizations. The old practice of clerks monopolizing power has already become common today!</p>
<p>Is there a way to remedy this? Of course. The fundamental solution will have to wait until the world is at peace. It's nothing more than the government guaranteeing the lives of scholars, rewarding various academic research, etc., which is too far removed from what's possible in today's reality. We won't discuss it. If we're talking about a temporary solution that addresses the current situation, then I propose that universities have two sets of education, and must add some practical subjects.</p>
<p>For example, in the liberal arts college, in addition to the literature history, author studies, and masterpiece studies that are currently offered, the courses that must be added should include: (1) editing skills, (2) official document formats, (3) archive management, (4) writing skills (not the composition in freshman Chinese, but rather "penmanship"), (5) calligraphy and Chinese and English typing, (6) Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese... etc. Those studying politics should also learn official document formats and archive management, as well as: (1) etiquette, striving for a good appearance, even if you're not good-looking, you must be generous and poised, with appropriate deportment, not sneaky, stingy, and annoying; (2) let's call it "officialdom studies" for now, such as how to handle official documents with appropriate weight, as well as how to handle expense reports and transfers of responsibilities, which have been discussed very heatedly recently; not to teach you how to cheat, but to let you know how to prevent others from cheating. In addition to having to learn factory management, science and engineering students must also learn how to deal with practical problems such as labor disputes. In addition, it's best for everyone to learn some teaching skills, to learn how to maintain classroom order, how to attract students' attention, etc., so that they can still teach when necessary. I'm not looking down on teaching at all, but I believe that teaching should be the job of graduates from normal universities, and ordinary university graduates should find other outlets.</p>
<p>Do you think I'm fantasizing? In fact, my suggestion is truly practical. Otherwise, look, right here on the tea table next to my sofa, there's another unlucky résumé...</p>
<h3>Inscription for a Painting of a Wild Goose by the Moon</h3>
<p>— Zhang Buqu</p>
<p>At the edge of the sky, the frontier pass, the moon is three watches late; the cold geese call to their flock across ten thousand miles; the plan for the rice harvest is still undecided; the plants and trees of Jiangnan already echo the sounds of autumn!</p>
<h3>Feeling Intoxicated Frequently in Autumn</h3>
<p>Day after day, the soldiers of wine attack the city of sorrow, but the drunkard will not allow his ten thousand thoughts to become empty; near the house, the departing swallows chirp to their nests; in the distant sky, the migrating swans shriek to avoid calamity; the western wind carries the withered leaves, fading to green, and the twilight flowers drip with broken red; the hundred-foot-high branches are lonely in autumn, and it is even harder to turn back to the northern window Paulownia.</p>
<h3>Gambling Game</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>Recently, at a friend's banquet, I saw a not-so-large-scale sand crab gambling game. Relying only on the secret of a single hidden card, everyone was focused and vying for the large stack of gold yuan notes in the center of the table. The seriousness of the situation could be seen in everyone's expressions. A hunched his shoulders, the muscles on his face lacking elasticity, his eyes constantly watching the "face cards" of others, carefully trying to figure them out. B had a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, the ash already accumulated to half an inch long, yet still not falling, constantly flipping his hidden card, wanting to make a desperate bet based on his own strength... When C pushed all the banknotes he had on him into the center of the table, the eyes of the others were all stunned, considering whether or not to raise him.</p>
<p>This is truly a reckless gamble. A group of gamblers around the round table, in that moment, mostly had the spirit of rushing through fire and water. No wonder Mr. D, who participated in the game, when he gave up the final showdown of that battle, said to the observing writer with a relaxed posture, gambling "crab" is like war, both need to understand "military strategy."</p>
<p>Gambling "crab" is like war, I think news reporters have long understood this meaning. Opening today's newspapers, you can often see the term "showdown" in the headline news, a term belonging to sand crab gambling. Examining the term "showdown," in Shanghai slang it's called "flipping sand crab," revealing all your skills and tricks. If you want to compete with him, you have to rely on your own strength to fight hard!</p>
<p>Looking at the current social situation, it seems that life is also engaged in a sand crab gambling game. Many people are converting gold yuan, obtained from gold, silver, and foreign currencies, into extravagant enjoyment. The larger ones buy houses and properties, the middling ones collect treasures and add clothing and decorations, and the smaller ones travel and enjoy themselves, lingering in sensual pleasures – it is said that the hotels in Hangzhou are fully booked this autumn, the reason being a vent for Shanghai stockbrokers as "hot money."</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be using "a sand game" to dispel the low-pressure season, indulging in enjoyment, holding the attitude of "drink today while you have wine today" to stake their lives on one throw of the dice. The magnitude of this gamble can be imagined.</p>
<p>Promoting diligence and frugality to correct extravagance is certainly the right medicine, the problem is how to turn people's hearts around and make them voluntarily tend towards the smooth current of frugality. This turning point should be "stability." Only with a stable life can people cherish things like gold, because now is no longer an era for empty slogans.</p>
<h3>A Note on the Painting "Dwelling in Qingbian"</h3>
<p>— Peng Gusheng</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, Gan Province had two major collectors: Lü Dimannong (Xuegeng), known for collecting bronze inscriptions and paintings, and Miao Zhiting (Defen), known for collecting editions. Mannong was the esteemed father of Mr. Di Pingzi. He was a refined connoisseur and had a rich collection. The two paintings he most treasured in his life were the Album of Five Elders painted by a Song Dynasty artist, which later belonged to Sheng Xibo, and Wang Meng's "Dwelling in Qingbian." This painting uses dry brushstrokes for the mountains and thick ink for the trees, with a vivid and unrestrained spirit, purely following the style of Ju Ran. Its wildness and ruggedness surpass its origins. It has an inscription in running script by Dong Xiangguang: "The greatest Wang Shuming under heaven," and also records a poem by Ni Yunlin: "Wang Youjun's brush is refined and his ink is exquisite; he contemplates the Dao with a pure heart, following Zong Shaowen. The power of Wang Hou's brush can lift a tripod; for five hundred years, there has been no one like him." Such was the high regard that Ni and Dong had for him.</p>
<p>This painting was successively collected by the Zhenshangzhai and Tianlaige. Mannong obtained it while traveling as an official in Jiangxi and regarded it as a supreme treasure, unwilling to easily show it to others. At the time, a certain Wang, a high-ranking official in Gan Province, also had a passion for calligraphy and painting. He happened to see it during a visit and wanted to seize it by force. Di vowed to die rather than part with it, nearly reenacting the story of the Qingming Scroll. Fortunately, a certain Taoist intervened, and the Five Elders painting was given to Wang, resolving the matter. The Notes from the Pingdeng Pavilion once described its outline.</p>
<p>The Pingdeng Pavilion's collection of famous paintings numbered no fewer than one hundred and several dozen, but this painting alone was the most prized masterpiece. Pingzi cherished it as a priceless treasure during his lifetime. Even his close friend Wang Zizhan (i.e., Wang Kemin's father) requested to see it many times and was only granted one viewing. Japanese art lovers also coveted this painting and repeatedly offered large sums of money to buy it, but Pingzi remained unmoved, fortunately avoiding the continuation of the Four Treasures of Linchuan. Later, on the occasion of the Japanese Emperor's birthday, a member of the Japanese Imperial family invited Pingzi to Japan to appraise the bronze inscriptions and paintings in the Japanese palace collection, with an insurance of 600,000 gold. This painting was taken along for exhibition, showing how valuable it was. There are five copies, with the one copied by Runzhou Junshi, now belonging to Japan, being the best. The Youzheng Bookstore also has a photoprint, but it is difficult to purchase after the robbery.</p>
<h3>Pi Xiaoxue</h3>
<p>The fashion of "no meat" is now very common. Reading what is published in this newspaper, I know that it is the same in Shanghai. Generally, this phenomenon is caused by price limits and shortages. There is universality, without regional differences. However, the pain of no meat in Beiping is different from elsewhere. This universality also has its particularity. Since the Stone Jin ceded the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun to the Khitans, and even when the Mongols established their capital, they were all dominated by nomadic tribes. Those above imitated what those above did, and those below followed like grass in the wind. Therefore, many street names in Beiping are "Mutton Alley," "Pig Market Entrance" (now changed to Pearl Market Entrance), Ox Blood Alley (now changed to Study Abroad Road), Horse Market Street, Mutton Horn Alley, Ox Tail Alley, Guima Market Street. There are countless streets and alleys with various names of oxen, sheep, pigs, and horses. You can still imagine the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties, with the city full of mutton and milk, reeking of meat and grease, and the gluttonous feast of the slaughterhouse, with meat at all times and in every meal. As for the modern Qing imperial family, there was even a grand ceremony of "eating meat." Ministers considered it a great honor to be rewarded with "eating meat in the palace." In the narration of the slow progress of officialdom and in the obituaries, this was listed together with the honors of "being rewarded with a palanquin" and "being rewarded with treasures." During the "meat eating," a large plate of meat was placed in front of the throne and in front of the desks of each minister, with knives and chopsticks provided. There were no other flavors. The ministers thanked the emperor for the reward and cut and ate the meat themselves. Some hung the leftover meat behind their palanquins when they left, as a way to boast. When the princes and ministers of each banner family encountered sacrifices or family celebrations, they also imitated the court, cooking large pigs and sheep with 　guests. Not attending or not eating much was disrespectful to the host. Han Chinese who had lived here for a long time also adopted the banner customs. For example, Ji Xiaolan (Yun) did not use rice or noodles in every meal, but only meat as the main food. The above are all found in Yao's "Bamboo Leaf Pavilion," Liang's "Return to Field Miscellany," and various notes.</p>
<p>The number of "meat" businesses and the types of names in the market and among the people are even more characteristic of the old capital. For example, those who specialize in "meat" include raw meat stalls in the vegetable market, sauce elbow shops (named 　elbow, but in fact, salty legs, sausages, and all parts of the pig's body, except the pig's head and tail, are prepared, and raw meat is also sold), sauce mutton shops, beef shops, or both beef and mutton are sold, but they are separated from pork shops as if by a gulf, called "separate religions." Those who sell both cooked products and raw meat are the same as sauce meat shops. There are rice shops that specialize in meat flavors for meals, such as the White Meat Restaurant in the west of the city (i.e., Shaguoju, which uses all parts of the whole pig's body to make various styles, without vegetables and other flavors) and mutton restaurants. (Such as Xilaishun, Yimuyuan, Zhengyanglou, Roasted Meat Chen, etc., countless, specializing in various flavors of mutton, with various cooking and preparation methods.) There are also small shops and stalls that specialize in selling roasted mutton, sauce mutton, and beef, and there are stalls that specialize in selling pork head meat, mutton head meat, pig intestines (named fried liver), mutton intestines (named frost intestines), sheep tripe (named burst belly), and beef tendons and lamb offal. Each carries a small basket and sells them in various markets or along the alleys, until late at night. At this time of high autumn, with the north wind gradually strengthening, until winter, it is the time when the stove fire is burning brightly and the fragrance of meat is overflowing. In the food shops that come from the south, such as Fujian's meat floss shops, Guangdong's preserved meat and sausage shops, as well as chicken and duck shops, they are all based on "meat" as their business, without meat there is no business. Without these industries, most of the city's prosperity is lost.</p>
<p>Meat is still essential in places that do not specialize in selling "meat products," such as Chinese and Western restaurants, southern-flavored shops (like "Daoxiang"), and savory food shops (wonton, dumplings, meat pies, etc.). How can they do without meat for a day? However, since the middle of last month, the city's meat has gone from shortage to extinction. Raw meat, cooked meat, and meat products have caused great panic. Some stopped selling on the door, and some temporarily changed industries (such as stalls selling meat changed to fried tofu). The market was unusually desolate. By the last sentence of September, it gradually became active again. Except for raw meat shops, which were still empty and cold, cooked meat and meat-based food shops and stalls suddenly filled with goods. The meat in Chinese and Western restaurants was also endless, saying it was bought directly from the slaughterhouse, but isn't it still a black market? They buy at high prices and sell at high prices. There are many types and miscellaneous styles. "August 19th" is what standard? There is no way to check it clearly. Moreover, cooked meat has different seasonings and preparation methods, which can be worded, and there is plenty of room for flexibility.</p>
<p>However, the raw meat stalls in the vegetable market, whether beef, mutton, or pork, are still empty. As a result, housewives and cooks have no way to buy meat, cook dishes, or make buns and wontons. Those who want to get a meat 　 can only go to the shop to buy sauce meat, smoked meat, and buy sausages, pig's head meat, and mutton head meat from small stalls or sellers. There are still a few sellers of raw mutton, but pork is absolutely unavailable without acquaintances.</p>
