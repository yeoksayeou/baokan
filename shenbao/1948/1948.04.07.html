<h3>國大進入正式議程　昨首次會討論議事規則　主席團請準備選舉總統</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國民大會六日上午開第一次會議，進入正式議程，主席團第一組輪値主持，于右任主席，九時廿五分宣告開會，秘書長洪蘭友報告主席團輪流担任主席辦法及分組名單後，第一組主席團各主席相繼登台，洪氏亦於全塲鼓掌聲中就職。旋全體起立爲革命先烈暨抗戰戡亂陣亡將士與死難同胞默哀，繼即分章討論大會議事規則草案案，各代表依次發言，草案第一章「總則」中，關於未經發表文件代有保密義務一點，若干代表認爲應隨時確定須保守秘密事項。且大會職員亦應規定保密義務，關於開預備會議之第五條認爲宜改列第三章。而於第一章中增列一條，規定國大開會時應聽取政府施政報告並提出建議。第二章「代表資格審查」一事，若干代表認爲報到時已查驗證書，核對照片，應即爲合格，無再度審查必要，此章須加删除。第三章「開會」時不足法定人數延長等待次數已規定二次，然若千代表認爲每次延長時間亦須規定，至會議中途退席不影饗法定人數計算一點亦認應加限制。第四章爲「提案」，第十七條「提案範圍以有關憲法第廿七條之規定者爲限」一點，復遭遇多數代表反對，咸認國大之職權憲法有明確列舉，不應以議事規則妄加限制，有主將提案範圍予以擴大者，亦有主張將之删除者，然其目標均在使國大有權過問政務國事，會議至十時五十分稍停休息，主席團在後臺集犧後，十一時廿五分續會，適此際首都電廠藉大會休息調換供電綫路，全塲內部僅有小燈數盞，光綫暗澹，于主席乃徵詢會衆意見後宣布散會，唯以事出倉卒，一部代表不明散會理由，羣集主席合質問，秩序又一度小亂，直至正午各代表始盡離會塲。（圖爲于右任報告情形）</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國大第一次會議，將於七日竟日開會，第二·三兩次大會，分別於上午九時。下午三時舉行，主席國六日決定第二·三兩組輪値，由谷正綱·張鈁·賀衷寒寒分別主持，預定之議事日程，除秘書處報告文件外，主席團六日決定之大會提案，定十日中午截止，將提出報告。討論事項除繼續討論六日未了之議事規則外，代表資格審齊委會，紀律委會之組織規程及提案審查委會組織通則，亦準備提出討論。</p>

<h3>民航機被襲事件　我將提最後抗議</h3>
<p>蘇方覆文外部硏究中</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕外交部發言人六日證實，蘇聯關於於空運大隊飛機一架在渤海上空受蘇機侵襲事對我抗議之二次覆文，已於三日晚由蘇聯大使館送達外部，其內容與莫斯科宜布者相同，是項覆文於外部渡過週末，五日始爲高級官員閱及，故該部未能於五日證實此事。發言人並稱：現外部正將該覆文硏究，可能再予阪覆，提出最後之抗議。另據記者獲悉：雙方爭執難決之處，約有數端：（一）蘇聯硬說被襲飛機標誌不明，此乃强詞奪理。（二）蘇聯硬說被襲飛機曾兩度飛越旅順海軍基地領空，我方則以該機確未飛越基地上空，且即使曾飛越基地上空，亦係在我主權區領空內應有之自由。（三）蘇聯認爲根據中·蘇條約中關於旅順口之協定，蘇軍司令部有權迫降標誌不明之飛機，然我方則認爲在我國主權區領空，我國飛機有自由航行權，空運大隊飛機機身標誌分明，尤無接受蘇機迫降檢查命令之理。（四）蘇聯覆文中更要求以後我機飛臨旅順基地上座，應事先通知駐港蘇軍司令部一節，我方認爲除非兩國對日有戰事進行，爲技術必須外，平時民航機並不降落，尤無必要。</p>

<h3>火燒鎮江金山寺　財產損失五千億　僧人跳火殉寺達廿餘名</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江六日電〕名震宇內，家喩戶曉，被譽爲東南唯一佛教勝境之鎭江金山寺，於今下午三時發生大火，燃燒達五小時，金寺殿宇被焚燬約百餘間，藏經樓所貯珍貴經典，盡付一炬，火勢燎原，後捨身殉寺，跳火自焚的僧人，約有二十餓名，公私財產，損失約達五千億，誠爲空前浩刧。當經該寺庫房火起時，本報記者正陪同京滬記者團諸同業在山遊覽，正擬訪問該寺方丈，適報火整，遂羣趨寺前視察，目擊火起時，黑烟冉冉上升，三點五十分第一架用人力拖曳之救火車（小白龍）到塲時，火舌已高及大雄寳殿，俄頃，火勢燎原，未及五點，該寺之水陸堂，寳光樓，自由堂，大雄寳殿，妙高台，雄華堂，留玉閣，均化刦灰。火勢蔓延時，雖經該管河橋警所派　押同卡車，各處接應大批兩條腿之水龍到塲救火時，火燄已無法壓制。迄晚諸救火員，均口咬乾糧，手握汽油燈，努力救火，當萬家燈火齊燃時，此一代古刹，泰半已成灰燼。差可告慰於世人者，即上窮碧落之七級古塔以及神話猶傳之法海洞猶聳立江濱，幸告無恙。據該寺常家師太滄告本報記者云：自晋梁以迄於今，祝融降於該寺者，已歷七次，然過去每次被焚後均能重建，特不知今日被災後，何日方能修復。又太滄和尚今會圖跳火殉寺，經人攔阻，未得葬身火坑。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　正式議程第一天！</h3>
<p>本報特寫　（四月六日於南京）</p>
<p>國民大會的里程碑，已經告訴我們，今天是進入大會正式議程的第一天。上午第一次大會，爲了等候滿足法定人數，爲了會場電燈臨時發生故障，遲開早散，一共開了八十五分鐘的會。其中因爲宣讀第六次預備會會議紀錄，報告了一連串主席團選舉結果的人名及票數和例行公事祝賀電，代表請假電，以及秘書長報告主席團會議的結果等，又佔去了廿分鐘的時間，所以今天正式用在討論提案上的時間，是一小時又五分鐘，開會時是九時廿五分，休息時是從十一時欠十分開始。主席宣布繼續開會後，馬上宣布散會的時間是十一時廿五分。其後則因散會問題，引起了騷動，有人認爲大會堂幾乎成了火藥庫，極易失事爆炸，今天不過是一點小小的引線。幸而暴風雨祗是來時猛烈，不久風靜雨止，也就過去了。</p>
<p>大會開始討論議事規則草案，全案共分十三章計六十六條，于右任先請代表們廣泛發表意見，先後有廿二人發言，前三章意見不多，進行到第四章却觸了礁。代表們集中注意的是國民大會戰禮，在第一章總則裏有人提出應該增列「國大開會期問，得聽取政府施政報告，並提出質詢及建議等事項。」第四章提案部份，第十七條是「提案範圍以有關憲法第廿七條之規定者爲限」，大部份發言者都覺得限制太苛。余籍傳大聲疾呼，我們是人民的代表，我們應當對常前各種問題都要明瞭，都能發表意見，凡是政洽。社會·文化·軍事·經濟的提案，都可以討論。林彬認爲第十七條應該删除，因爲憲法第廿七條已規定了修改憲法的職權，凡是與行憲有妨碍的，我們都可以提案討論修正。但是第廿七條並沒有能把整個國大職權包括在內，因此有若干問題如根據第十七條之規定，就無法提附來。比如會期問題，憲法規定可以召開臨時大會，　　訂定日期，如果我們不能在大會裏提案討論，就會因召集之困難而舉行無期，因此林彬說，這成爲職權雖有而施行無時，這一次會是第一次大會，也成了第末次大會，他的結論是十七條應該删去，他的說明層次分明博得幾次熱烈掌聲。因爲他的談話裏，第一是取消了議事規則對提案的限制，第二還提醒了大家在大會裏應行規定的臨時會日期。</p>
<p>發言者繼續對第十七條對提案所加之限制作反面，不同意的抨擊。華壽崧說，這一條的規定，無異是對我們的意見和提案的約束，如在疆土變更，我們就不能在大會討論？所以我認爲應修改爲「以憲法賦予國大之職隨爲限」。</p>
<p>其次又有認爲當前國是大會應提出討論，而第十七條却不能包括。黃一鳴說，動員戡亂的問題，應在討論之列。更有人說，如照第十七條之規定，幾成爲「免談國事」了。最後東北代表郭鴻祥又慷慨陳詞，他說：我們要聽取國是的報告，我們要對戡亂救亡的問題付諸討論。要知我們今日在這裏開會，東北却是怎樣的局面？郭代表的話，充滿了熱情和力量，會塲的空氣都被他拉得緊緊的。最後他大呼，「國家要亡了，這一次會應該是一次戡亂建國大會」。他一邊大呼，一面拍桌子，引起了不少同情黨聲。　廣泛發表意見今天是第一天，大致的意見，就是擴大國大職權，和放寬提案限度。</p>
<p>大會於十一時欠十分宜布休息。這裏忽然發生了意外的枝節，會塲電燈在休息時間裏，發生故障而失明，全塲只憑幾個小燈的光亮照耀着，自然與大會的進行有礙。因此休息時問一再延長，直至十一時廿五分復會時，燈還沒有亮。於是主席于右任一開始就報告電燈失明，是不是可以提早散會？只因右老聲浪稍低，全塲代表沒有聽淸，以至大多數是採取旣不同意也不反對的態度，右老認爲大家默認，於是宣布散會。誰知惡作劇的電燈就在宣布散會後復明，全塲通亮，樓上下二千餘代表立時騷動，責問：「爲什麼散會」？一部份代表擁上主席合，聲勢洶洶，「爲什麼散會」？「一定是故意的，認爲我們要討論一些案子，就草率從事」，「太隨便」。林紫貴代表尤其激昂，跳上發言合大呌：「我們自己開會，另選主席」，大部份代表是旣不明白爲什麽提早散會，更不知道林代表爲什麼這麼激動？於是樓上下都混亂起來。主席因爲已經宣布了散會，沒有臨時變更的必要，先行退席，留下了一團紛亂。洪秘書長把嘶啞的喉嚨來說明「爲什麼散會」，可是沒有人能聽出他的聲音，嘈雜一片，最後還是張壽賢的勸導，林紫貴大呼：「好，提到明天大會討論」，這一點小引綫，只是「聽不到」，可是林代表的話也沒錯，「一天開了一個多鐘點的會，老百姓不知道我們在幹什麼」？</p>

<h3>社論　韓國南北分合的關頭</h3>
<p>聯合國朝鮮委員會在漢城的工作，可以說是完全失敗了。委員會主席梅魚和秘書長胡世澤旣已聯袂　韓，加拿大和澳洲的代表也堅決反對委員會監督五十選舉，並批評小型聯大作此項建議是「不智而且違背憲章」。正當委負會陷於分崩離析之際，北韓蘇聯佔領軍司令部，對南韓右派左派及中間派各黨領袖發出邀請，促於四月十四日在北韓舉行全韓政黨會議，商討設立韓國政府問題。現在南韓各政黨，紛紛集會，舉行測驗，除李承晚和金成洙所領導的民主黨，願意參加五十選舉外，其餘各政黨無論左右派或中問派，均一致反對單獨選舉。至於四月十四日北韓主持的政黨會議，南韓各政黨是否參加，或參加後是否協調一致，此際尚難判斷。不過韓國這一新局勢的發展，說明了聯合國朝鮮委員會工作的失敗，和美國軍　進行南韓選舉政策的失策。</p>
<p>聯合國朝鮮委員會的組織，是根據聯大決議，而這決議又根據美國提議而來。委員會以九國代表爲中心，烏克蘭拒絕參加，其他八國參加的動機，是想以中立的態度，促進美蘇協調，，合理解決韓國問題，從而解除朝鮮人民的桎梏。委員會到了漢城，理想成了泡影，對於南韓美軍統治政策感到失望，對於南韓若干政黨領袖的印象也欠佳；而北韓的政黨，在蘇聯控制之下，不僅不願同南韓合作，甚且拒絕與委員會合作，梅農要求到北韓觀察，探測各政黨的意向，北壤電合也拒絕了。梅農感此行究全無功，二月廿四日小組聯大開個，乃返成功湖覆命，希冀另關途徑打開僵局。美國態度相當堅決，向小型聯大建議單獨進行南韓選舉，在南韓選出三分之二的國民代表，保留三分之一的代表，以待北韓參加。這個建議案於廿六日通過，仍未獲得蘇聯及其五衛星國的支持。値得注意的，是加漢兩委員國的反對，大約加渙很躭心：單獨選舉容易激成韓國的分裂，加速促成美蘇的衝突，似乎對於李承晚輩的人望也很懷疑。漢城的美軍司令霍奇，於小型聯大決議通過後，即宣佈五月九日（後改爲五月十日）爲南韓選舉期，並要求委員會負監督之責。在小型聯大決議通過前，委員會各國的意見尚一致，決議通過後便發生了分歧，加渙兩國表示失望，中印代表更悄然離去，委員會也就無形停頓了。</p>
<p>韓國的悲劇，是美蘇造成的。韓國弱小，可憐三千萬人民，迄今尚受北緯卅八度　綫的隔離，互不往來，不通有無。我們同情韓國的遭遇，對於委員會工作的失敗，並不予以重視，如果南韓各政黨眞正的堅持拒絕參加五十選舉，蘇聯自然不會遽爾宣佈北韓獨立，則南北韓人民應該爭取此一時機，自動自覺，突破美蘇的桎梏，大家伸出和平友愛的手來，共同合作與統一，莫讓希臘的悲劇在韓國出現。我們屢次論說，韓國問題應由韓人自己解決，現在時機已至，南北韓的政治家，不應再徘徊「事齊乎事楚乎」的觀念，失去了自强圖存的機運。最近漢城「韓國與論協會」，舉行韓人民意測騐，贊成南韓單獨選舉的，僅有百分之五，贊成南北韓各政黨要人協商統一辦法的，竟佔百分之七十一，比足以明顯表示南韓人民熱望南北統一之意向。北韓在蘇軍控制下，自無眞正的民意表示，但不用判斷而明白，富有智慧和創造力的韓人，他們的血緣關係決定了他們的生存意志是共同的。韓人獨立的思想，原無南北之分，除了少數人的不良傾向外，相信廣大韓人的良知是熱烈統一的。</p>
<p>中韓關係密切，爲了遠東未來的和平，我們煞　的贊成韓國，作統一。現在韓國和平團結的曙光在　，希冀南北韓政治家，在漢城平壤不自由的氣氛之外，聚首協商統一的辦法，英讓　鄰和廣大的人民失望。中國歷史哲學曾指出了小會的命運，唯一的途徑是自强不息的奮鬥，纔能生存於天地之問。「　小國也，　泰乎？事楚乎？」這是小國的疑問，事秦事楚均有被兼併的危險；如不爲　楚所欺，應該努力自强爲義國·孟子曰：「今勝絕長補短，將五十里也，猶可以爲美國。」今韓國有地二二萬平方公里，佔日本總面積三分之一以上，六倍我們的臺灣省；人口三千萬，秉賦厚於日人，富潦大於台灣，如果獨立自强，對於遠東的和平與安定，必有良好的貢獻。我們因此要喚起美蘇兩强的警覺：韓國和平獨立，可以作為美蘇的緩衝，如果美蘇要避免遠東的戰爭，應該退出朝鮮，坐觀韓國的獨立統一，使牠成爲遠東和平的走廊，不要使牠變成火藥庫。美蘇的軍事家根據地緣政治的理論，爭相控制朝鮮半島，此非避免戰爭的作法，這是自焚，而非焚人，望强權政治愼之。</p>

<h3>國際新聞自由會議制止不善意報道　葛羅茨大發雷霆</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>〔本報日內瓦三月三十日航訊〕新聞自由會議進入了第二個階段，大會開過了，以後的重點，移轉到小組委員會。中國代表團對於小組委員會的處理，也有了「分工」的辦法，首席代表張彭春，自己担任出席總務委員會，在聯合國大會機構中，通常呌做「指導委員會」，相當於中國習慣用的「主席團」總務委員會決定議事程序，法規，以及其他不屬於新聞自由的技術問題，辯論的多半是外交性質的事項。總務委員會以外，有四個討論新聞自由的小組委員會：第一委最會討論新聞自由的原則與理論，中國代表團推程滄渡出席。第二委員會、討論新聞自由之採　及傳達，由鄧友德出席。第三委員會，討論自由出版及自由　告，由　　　出席。第四委員會討論　合國新聞自由之久久　構及組織，由馬星野出　。</p>
<p>威廉倍頓發言　強調理性道德</p>
<p>代表威廉倍頓。在第一委員會上，作了一次爲大家賞識的演講。這位雷過助理國務卿，也當過美國新聞處華盛頓總處處長的新聞老手，講話非常溫文，得體，有力。他最初說了一大段開於美國對新開自由的提倡成長和貢獻，然後說到美國人民對於新聞自由的基本觀念，他說：美國人民崇奉理性，美國人民相信新聞自由是美國的道德標準之一，做一個神聖的新聞工作者，他們有不變的道德上的信心，在第二次世界大戰中，美國發揮着這一股最高的道德力量，像摧枯拉朽一擊敗了法西斯。「但是，今日我們最引爲遺憾的，是世上仍然　强　，有用能力來摧毀新聞自由主義家」。他又義：這一次會議，不容　們太　　，但無論如何，　然沒有一條　議案，我們來到日內瓦，我們的努力不是白費的。我們要集合全世界的代表，把那些薪聞自由的莊嚴的字句，用白紙黑字，寫在我們人類的經典上，這種努力，決不是徒勞無功的。然後他作結論說：</p>
<p>反對暴力專制　發揮新聞自由</p>
<p>幾天以前，美國大總統杜魯門先生，在國會演講，總統說了幾句非常沉痛的話：「捷克的自由死亡了，捷克的新聞自由也死亡了！」今天多少國家在暴力和專制之下，犧牲了他們國民的自由！讓我們一致振奮起來，我們要發揚新聞自由這一個威理，使這一個眞理，成爲國家獨立，世界和平，以及人類尊嚴的標識。</p>
<p>熱烈的堂　，報答給威廉倍頓。當他的演講進行中途，全塲鴉雀無聲，美·英·法·蘇·中·五强的代表團都到，蘇俄代表團　比竊竊耳語，顯現得非常緊張。許多小國都漠不關心，甚至有很多國家的零次，全　空著。我曾經檢點整個代表　上，一共　九十二人。</p>
<p>更請　的　目，是無天下午的波蘭演說，波蘭首席代表葛羅茨將軍，去年在華沙認識的「老朋友」，葛羅茨是波蘭的新聞局長，過去是他，現在還是他。葛羅茨將軍是波蘭共產黨政府中的了不起的人才，而且是唯一的人才。不但他的英文·俄文·法文設得流利驚人，而且思想細密，口齒玲琍。這次新聞會議，他是波蘭的首席代表，他站起來用英文講，說得很慢，一個字一個字，打到聽衆的心坎裏。</p>
<p>葛羅茨的見解　請勿痛罵波蘭</p>
<p>他說：波蘭政府及人民，始終信奉新聞自由和正確報道的原則，因爲新聞自由可以促成國際合作並剷除彼比的誤解。自從一九四四年波蘭從納粹法西斯的鐵路之下解放出來，到現在不過三年多，波蘭現在已經有七百卅五種出版物，包括報紙，雙誌及期刋。波蘭政府允許任何宗敎信仰的　紙發刋，因爲尊重要　自由，一但是不幸的，是外國記者到波蘭來，　作的報道，大大的妨礙了波蘭的國家利益。</p>
<p>葛羅茨路軍　　到極點，他說：從一九四六年三月到一九四八年三月，兩年之間，一共有四百個外國記者來到波蘭，其中有二百五十個是美國記者，他們在波蘭享受一切的便利，優待和自由，他們可以儘情的看，儘情的問，在外國記者招待會上，他們像最精明的審判官，問所有一切要問的疑慮，波蘭政府尊重他們的新聞自由，總算仁至義盡了，但是，他們寫的，記載的，盡是滿紙痛駡波蘭，他們眼光中，從不把一個擁有二千五百萬人民的波蘭，放在眼裏。</p>
<p>尊重各國利益　促成國際聯合</p>
<p>他列舉實例之後，又說：波蘭政府絕對信奉新聞自由，但有接受嚴酷的歷史敎訓的必要。波蘭政府對於這一次新聞自由會缺，主張討論下列幾點。（一）新聞自由要尊重各國彼此間的國家利益。（二）剷除漫駡挑撥與戰爭販十。（三）要末全人類的進步生活，掃除反動的新聞報導。（四）在聯合國中設立永久機構，監督管理上面所講的越軌行動。葛羅茨的最後結論是：新聞自由不是要促使世界分裂，而要造成國際間的聯合。</p>
<p>他在許多掌聲中坐下來，我聽完葛羅茨的演講，步行到艾登飯店，我告訴馬星野先生，關於葛羅茨的演講內容，馬老師拍着大腿說：「講得對，講得對！」</p>
<p>如果我們撇開國際政治的立塲不談，站在一個純粹中中新間記者的崗位上，每天在紐約看美國記者們在中國發回美國來的電報，通訊或照片，我無限地　情　羅茨的憤　，一個純新聞工作者的憤　！</p>

<h3>美增強極化防務　阿留申羣島建戰略基地　海軍艦隊月杪訪問挪威</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕美國軍事當局通告繼在阿留申羣島劃出大　軍用公地，當局僅稱此舉爲例行公事。但該羣島距蘇聯最近，其在第二次世界大戰中之任務，證明軍略上之重要性，日軍曾用以襲擊美國本地，美軍亦曾利用該威基地，向日本千島列島作報復攻擊。千島列島現已劃　蘇聯。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕美陸海空軍撥將阿留申羣島甲之一連事島嶼限供軍用，以直接增强北冰洋方面之防禦。又據海軍部宣布，美機動艦隊將於四月廿九日至五月二日赴挪威貝爾根港作親善訪問，官方雖稱此兩者爲　例之事，但皆具有背景。國防部長福萊斯特曾於兩星期前發表阿拉斯加防軍僅七千，戰鬥機不足一百架，且前計劃擬將兵力增至一萬五千人，此後並將續行擴張。杜魯門總統對斯坎的那維亞半島之發展會公開表示關切，蘇聯官方報紙則於十日後向挪威發動攻擊，此間外交家認爲係實施新壓力之信號。猶憶一年以前，莫斯科電台會宣布挪威已同意將斯畢資伯根島之軍事基地讓與美國，經挪威與以否認。斯華資伯根島處於俗自美國經北極至蘇聯烏拉爾山脈空運最短路綫一上之戰略地位，由一九二〇年國際協定廢除軍備，歸挪威管理。美國務部曾於去年表示該島地位如有變更，當與美國協商。此次美艦隊之訪問挪威港口，將間接增强其保持北極戰略島嶼之權力。</p>

<p>（十一）改進內陸軍運輸問題</p>
<p>當史迪威將軍想從他的北緬作戰中爲他個人找尋辯護，以及爲中國的疾病找尋萬應藥的時候，他的重慶司令部完全忽視了中國內部的運輸問題。</p>
<p>中國內部的局勢是如此，就是縱使緬甸公路暢通了，可能依然一無效果。戰區司令部三年來一直在想從緬甸闢一條通路到中國來，但是對於中國內部的運輸，却未能注意及之或者拒絕注意及之。</p>
<p>當戰區司令部專心於經由緬甸開闢一條通路的時候，它對於改進中國內陸運輸却一無作爲，對於便利分配飛越駝峯而來日益增多的供應品，以及對於卡車運輸的準備，都未注意，雖然卡車運輸是戰區司令部所熟烈期待的。</p>
<p>一九四四年當日本的攻勢突入中國東部之時，中國軍隊不能獲得陸上的供應，雖然戰區司令部是想給予這種供應的。</p>
<p>戰區司令部對於中國內部公路運輸的容易引爲滿意，可由一點見之，即在一九四二年時公路運輸幾不存在，供應處在那年年底祗僱用了一個民間工作人員泰勒來解決那個問題。</p>
<p>泰勒幾無任何協助，而須處理一椿其嚴重性不次於世界上其他工作的任務，他的失敗是注定了的。</p>
<p>一九四三年間，遝輸方面曾獲若干進展，但是此乃戰區司令部以外人員努力的結果。中國國防供應委員會和租借代表帮助泰勒，替中國機關，所使用的卡車覓致零件，這些卡車在中國不堪應用的公路上担任大部份的載運工作。中國國防供應委員會的二個民間工作人員替泰勒完成了第一個完全的公路調查，後者後來成爲戰區司令部的一個基本指導。</p>
<p>當中國國防供應委員會的一個代表交出這個硏究的時候，中緬印戰區的運輸主任頗表欣賞，但是在未看報告之前，先說他希望知道中國內部的運輸間題，是鐵路問題還是公路問題。　一九四四年一月，中國內部的運輸情形是如此令人震驚，結果我就飛到中緬印後防司令部所在地的印度新德里，並要求由空中服務司令部負責此項工作。我並不想自己來管理此事，但是我不知道用其他方法來使供應處指派有資格處理此項重大工作的人員。</p>
<p>結果，在二月間，希漢上校被派到中國來。鑒於其沒有充份人員，缺乏供應以及在他權力範圍之外的其他因素，希漢可以說頗有成就。但是當史迪威將軍於一九四四年下半年即緬甸公路開放的幾個月前被召返國時，仍舊沒有獲得完全的解決。</p>
<p>希漢爲一運輸專家，祖任供應處中國區的運輸主任。他把從雲南省到中國東部航空基地的主要交通綫的運輸量，從每月二千五百噸左右增至六千噸以上，雖然戰區司令部方面曾造成種種障礙。</p>
<p>從一九四三年年底起，人家曾獎次對史迪威講，就是中國人如不獲得物質援助，就不能有適當的運輸。事實上祗有兩種辦法，或則是把新卡車從空中運到中國來，或則在雲南省以東實行空運。</p>
<p>但是在一九四四年中，當史迪威承認第十四航空隊應獲得供應品俾能抵抗當時日軍在中國東部發動的攻勢之時，他把運輸責任交給中國政府辦理，而不願聽取相反的意見。</p>
<p>戰區司令部在中國方面的失敗，係與其對緬甸公路的估計相關。對於這個重大計劃的估計，戰區司令部方面一開始就是很膚淺的。</p>
<p>當緬甸公路問題予以充份考慮之時，運輸專家希漢上校對我說，爲了給羅斯福與邱吉爾參考，他佔計緬甸公路的運輸量每月決不能超過一一萬噸。他是出席過第一次魁見克會議的，結果證明這一數字還是太高。</p>
<p>可是在魁貝克會議中，對緬甸公路却產生了一個甚至更高的官方佔計。這是把希漢所提出表面上是保守的二萬五千噸至三萬噸的佔計，和另一個人隨便提出的十萬噸的數字折衷而得的。</p>
<p>史迪威對干增加飛越駝峯空運工作並不發生興趣，直到一九四三年春季之後。那時候，華盛頓的聯合參謀部准許我的空軍首先注意每月由駝峯運入貨物四千七百噸。</p>
<p>後來有一點成爲很明顯，就是唯有在第十四航空隊達到了每月運載四千七百噸的水準之後，怒江作戰始成爲可能。史迪威對于飛越駝峯的運輸工作，態度已稍有轉變。</p>
<p>但是我對于執行怒江作戰計劃的故事，暫時不講，留待在下一章中叙述。這是一個令人遺憾而至今還沒有人講過的故事。</p>

<h3>穩定指數擴大配給　各業同意互配出品　成立小組研究技術問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局召集之生活指數編制問題研究會，昨日下午四時在該局會議室舉行，出席市商會。中華國產廠商聯合會。及內衣織造工業·調味粉工業·第四區肥皂工業·手工棉織工業·六區紡織工業·毛巾被毯工業·捲烟皂燭業·樹柴業·醬園業等公會代表。社會局經濟行政處長顧炳元及勞工處長沈　，亦出席參加。會議由吳局長主持，說明上海市工業協會前因生活指數增漲，廠商不堪負擔，要求政府統一規定工資依上月份生活指數發給。此一建議，經政府考慮後未予實現。現生活指數編制中有數項日用必需品如米煤油糖等，已由政府配給，目前欲穩定指數，即在如何擴大配給品之範圍。目前政府負擔已重，再欲增加配給，實不勝負擔，故望各工廠相互合作推行配給制度，即除米煤油糖之外，各廠商均能以編製生活指數所列之日用必需產品參加配給，依照成本配售予全市職工。出席代表對此一原則均表贊同，決定組織推行日用必需品配給制度小組，於本月十二日下午三時召開第一次會議，商討技術問題，詳細硏究。小組人選經推定爲社會局經濟行政處長顧炳元，勞工處長沈鼎，工業協會田和卿，市商會金潤庠，造紙業葛傑臣，六區棉紡汪竹一，皂燭業梁嵩齡，染織業潘士浩，樹柴業張文學，針織業陸菊生，內衣織造業倪庚年第十一人。</p>
<p>吳局長昨日在會中提及，如機器·水泥等廠不能供應日用必需產品，但生活指數祗定一種，各業皆需採用，如此乃有祗享權利而不盡義務之情形發生。此一困難須待解決。經與會者交換意見後，決定交小組討論。據吳局長告記者：政府現爲穩定指數，一而推進配給政策，一面擴展合作社制度，互相呼應，相輔而行。此事爲地方政府之事，不需請示中央。</p>
<h3>總工會表示態度　配給須普遍完善</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於穩定生活指數，擴大日用品配給制度問題，昨日市總工會發言人表示態度，據談稱；總工會甚希望穩定物價，因生活指數係根據物價而產生，物價穩定，指數自然穩定。擴大日用品配給，總工會極表歡迎，惟配給必須普遍而完善。本市產業工人，職業工人凡依據生活指數計薪者，皆應享有配給權利，不可稍有偏廢，若日用品之配給僅及一部份產業工人或職業工人，而生活指數已受配給價格之影響降低，則未受配給物品者未免吃虧，且亦容易因此引起糾紛，故總工會希望當局對此事愼重考慮。又總工會今日召開理監事聯席會議，商討五一勞働節籌備事宜。</p>

<h3>社會局長返滬談話　本市全面配糧決定長期辦理　還須依賴洋米待向國外訂購</h3>

<p>市府決定　收購政策</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府爲收食米之供求平衡，俾農民之生活得以維持，而生產不受影響起見，決定實行收購政策。昨據吳市長向記者表示：食米收購政策，業經民食調配會於上週中擬具辦法，今後將視米市塲價格之高低，配合運用，蓋當食米供過於求時，米價必形低落，農民售米所得不足以維持生活，則勢將造成農村不景氣現象，其後果實不堪設想。爲求供求平衡起見，政府擬及時加以收購，若米市波動價格高漲時，則實行拋售，深信上項政策，可收穩定米價方實效。</p>
<p>配米價格　調整原因</p>
<p>記者當詢以本月份配米價格上漲原因，據吳市長表示：美方對救濟米援華一點，認爲有一一個原則：（一）非純粹救濟性質，而以穩定米價爲鵠的，（二）售米所得款項，充作全國慈善救濟之用，其救濟範圍，固不僅限於配米之五市。且中美雙方，對於救濟美米價格，竹制定比例，即不能低於自由米價之百分之五。爲此，配米價格乃不得不略作調整。又據吳市長表示：配米制度若不及時實施，則本市米價，今日可能已跳出五百萬大關。日前救濟美米正陸續運　，最低限度可能維持至新穀上塲時節，市民自毋須恐慌。</p>

<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>兵役釋疑（一）　上海市民政局第三科撲述</h3>
<p>今年本市征兵，經兵役會議議決，實施正規征集，這種辦法，就是按照扦號先後次序征集，一切手續都要依照法令規定辦理。</p>
<p>征兵的正規程序是；（一）身家調査（包括免遴役緩征召壯丁申請），（二）體格檢査，（三）抽扦，（四）征集。本市抽扦已在三月廿三日舉行，開征亦即將辦理，免禁役及綏征召壯丁申請審査，大致己吿完竣。其中尙有一部份因去年征集志願兵關係，市民對此不知注意，等到曉得本市要按號抽征，才着忙起來，紛紛來函詢問有關兵役法令之解釋，以及役政辦理之手續與程序。茲爲便利起見，總括各方之詢問，作一總答覆如下。</p>
<p>一，身家調査：</p>
<p>（一）先就調査說，調査的對象是現役及齡男子，依兵役法的規定，年滿二十歲之翌年，經征兵體格檢査合格，征集入營者服現役。今年征兵的年次是根據去年的調査，去年調査的年次是自民十六年至十二年出生的五個年次，此次抽托，亦根據去年的調査。</p>
<p>（二）上海因爲是我國最大的工商區，市民大都自各地遷來寄居，多數市民均有二個戶籍，依照兵役法規定，征集是要在本籍舉行，如寄居他籍的，經呈報核准後，亦可在寄居地服役。有許多壯丁，因爲有二個戶籍，兩地均參加抽扦，一個人沒有分身術，怎能二地服役？這個錯誤，必須糾正，辦法也很簡單，如在原籍履行兵役義務的，就請原籍鄕鎭公所出目原籍服役證明書，請寄籍地的區保長在調査名册裏面予以注銷，以免重複。</p>
<p>（三）征兵即將開始，有許多及齡男子，想法在戶籍册上報出，實際上壯丁並未遷出，仍在原處服務或營業。近來遷徙頻繁，此種逃避本身對國家所賦義務之懦怯行爲，影響役政很爲巨大。現政府已與民意機關及有關各機關代表會商結果，已於三月　句，通令在規定征兵處理期間，停止還徙。至於已在戶　上遷出而人仍在的一批壯丁，已電國防部以漏丁及逃役壯丁名義優先征送服役。根據報吿，漏丁，避役壯丁爲數甚多，這一批壯丁均有妨害兵役嫌疑，希望漏扦逃避兵役的壯丁，趕快向該管區保申報，不然將來要受到　　的。</p>
<p>二，免役禁役及緩召壯丁申請</p>
<p>審査；</p>
<p>凡是有正當理由，可以免役禁役或緩服兵役的，都是按照兵役法第四條第五條二十四條及二十六條規定審査，分別情形準予免役禁役及緩召。至於各條款所具原因，申請手續，應繳附證件和審査情形，分述如下：</p>
<h3>郵政問答</h3>
<p>本局茲收到（一）廣州莫慶楡君（二）本市何全源君來函詢問，特就所提各點，簡答如下：</p>
<p>（答）（一）（甲）本局對於權重郵件辦法，已設有郵件權重窗口，專司答復公衆交寄郵件所需郵資數。收寄郵件窗口人員，僅複核所貼郵票是否相符，手續至爲簡捷。（乙）本局收取窗口信箱郵件，約每隔半小時一次，日戳則每小時更換一次。若於廿一時卅分投入信箱之郵件，而於廿二時收取者，其日戳應爲廿三時。（丙）信件延誤，請將原信皮檢寄過局，俾便澈査。</p>

<p>—揚州續夢之二十八</p>
<p>吾揚辛補芸前輩所著小遊船詩，其稱道揚州搜西湖的昔時情况，眞不勝令人神往；筆者已於另文述及。繼辛先生之後，更有惺庵居士的揚州好百調。居士姓黃，名鼎銘，字錄奇。江都縣新志上說他「工文章，有聲庠序」。又說他「書法北朝，得其逸越。能詩，所作多隨手棄于去，揚州好及四書詩尙存」。這揚州好百調，調寄望江南，其抒寫的對象比之小遊船詩要廣闊得多，舉凡揚州的古跡，風物，習俗以及土宜等等都說到，大可當爲一部揚州小志讀。先大外祖臧詒孫題詞四絕，其第一首云：「冊載光陰一擲梭，吾鄉風物近如何？得名百調詞翻出，才覺揚州好處好！」第四首云；「小遊船泛夕陽時，曾和辛郞湖上詩；辜負藕花好天氣，不如黃九善塡詞。」其推崇揚州好百調，實非阿其所好。</p>
<p>揚州好中所寫的一切，時隔數十年，已有很大變異，但因寫得極親切有味，還可引起筆者若干舊夢。譬如說：</p>
<p>揚州好！盛典舉迎春。熊軾八抬瞻綵服，牛鞭三尺動香慶，隨後有芒神。</p>
<p>揚州好！神會出城隍。泥膝拜香痴婦女，貼肩隨駕俏兒郞，一一一次利孤忙。</p>
<p>揚州好！勝會出都天。茉莉萬花穿織扇，笙簫兩部導踿韆，台閣矗雲烟。</p>
<p>揚州好！水會夜深過。桂楫迎來都土地，荷燈放滿護城河，施食市僧多。</p>
<p>這許多迎神賽會之事，時至今日，幾已絕跡，而在淸末民初還是很爲熱閙。筆者過去雖未扮過「芒神」，也未「跕肩隨駕」，更未照料「合閣」或放燈施拿之類，却曾多次的隨着家人在羣衆中鑽進鑽出，手舞足蹈的譁笑着。當時又有瞎子賽會，尤饒風趣。</p>
<p>揚州好！賽會號雙盲。白眼橫加憐贖歵，紅旗分執共嚙蹌，隕越傎提防！</p>
<p>便是寫的此事。所惜如今揚州的瞎子幷不少而這樣的賽會之事却再難飽人眼福了。</p>
<p>此外揚州好上說：</p>
<p>揚州好！花局試徘徊。繞屋淸陰蘆箔護，分行濃艷瓦盆栽，雅意比憐才。</p>
<p>花局之多，使因時花愛花的人之多。鄭板橋曾說揚州「十里栽花當種田」，雖是夸讎其詞，但揚人過去多愛花草，却是事實。於此可見過去揚人之「雅」。又說：</p>
<p>揚州好！書廠破愁魔。說到飛跎回味美，聽來皮聞發科多，四座笑呵呵。</p>
<p>「飛跎」是指「飛跎子傳」，「皮　」是指「淸風閘」，這是道地的揚州評話，非土著是不會澈底了解其中許多俗語的，揚人都樂於去聽，兒童們聽到或談到飛跎或皮籤，則更眉飛色舞。於此又可見過去揚州之「閒」。「閑」與「雅」原是過去揚人的典型生活。可惜現時揚州花局甚少，已是花事闌珊，無復常年絢爛，而說淸風閘的還有，說飛跎子傳的已不可復得，就揚州評話界說，尤令人有老成彫謝之感。</p>
<p>末了，關於揚州淸末辦理敎育情形，揚州好中也曾說到，如：</p>
<p>揚州好！幾等學堂開。名別官私分敎育，課兼中外植英才，一歲一班來！</p>
<p>揚州好！廣闢體操塲。人比蝦蟆跳足走，羣如獅子搶球忙，從此國民强！</p>
<p>揚州好！女學集瑤姬。黑面書編懷裏挾，黃皮包裹手中携，眞個賽男兒！</p>
<p>大約黃先生是看得很不順眼，因而辭句之間，便充滿了謁侃的成分。又說：</p>
<p>揚州好！南北戲分台。名角兩班排日演，學員半票似潮來，旋閉又旋開！</p>
<p>這正是過去時髦靑年之時髦舉動。筆者在幼小時，對於此等舉動，也曾懷着無限艷羨的情懷，可是現在讀到黃先生這首詞，却祗引起無限的悵惘，即使筆者能够年光倒流，兒時可再，恐再無艷羨的勇氣，且任他放置在舊夢中罷！</p>
<h3>獨語</h3>
<p>— 郭天</p>
<p>在沒有陽光的幽徑，躑躅又躑躅，竹叢在沙沙地低泣；橋下流水在嘆息，古寺莊嚴的木魚，夾着一個生命的希望，在傍晚的晴空響着，一下又一下……</p>
<p>竹林的邊緣，接着一片枯黃的山野。我打從陰暗的竹徑，向光亮的山野走去，慢慢地，用手扶敲着草地。</p>
<p>碧藍的天，遠遠的山，應隼在高空飛翔，盤旋。我想，有翅膀多麽自由呵！飛越過重重關山，去作萬里的長征；衝破那海濤的滔滔，去迎接黎明的朝陽。……然而，人，人只有自由的思想……</p>
<p>——思想，是人的自由的翅膀呵！</p>
<p>展開了人的翅膀，旅行在那蒼凉的沙漠，白雪皚皚的西北高原，原始的荒野，未來的美麗的世界，神奇的國度裏的神奇的事物……。</p>
<p>病中的日子，在這深山的古寺，我遺忘了黯淡的家，生活在破舊的村莊野的人們。我鼓着生命的翅膀，飛翔在彩色的陽光裏。</p>
<h3>答</h3>
<p>— 鐵名</p>
<p>昨夜，她</p>
<p>爲我啜泣—</p>
<p>說我</p>
<p>緣何</p>
<p>如此消瘦，</p>
<p>不知覺惜。</p>
<p>我的心</p>
<p>好像</p>
<p>寒風裏的殘荷，</p>
<p>破碎，枯澀；</p>
<p>幾曾有綫</p>
<p>補織，</p>
<p>但我不願—</p>
<p>不願說。</p>
<h3>昆明之憶</h3>
<p>— 李朴園</p>
<p>天已經快黑，同往的幾位先生都不在家，馬路上儘管車聲不絕，在這小樓一角，却靜得聽得到耗子的脚步，我，伏在桌子上，該着姜額爾文底姜佛格森。</p>
<p>「請問你，有位李先生在家嗎」？</p>
<p>猛回頭，是劉獅！</p>
<p>說起來也快要十年了！在昆明，兩個不得意的人初次碰頭，一見如故，同發過牢騷，同吃過東西，同玩兒過釣台，也同演過小仲馬底茶花女。二十八年冬季，我被迫離開這四季如春的福地，此後就音訊隔絕。</p>
<p>如今快十年了，想不到在這寂寞的黃昏碰到他。</p>
<p>他，還是那樣精神，還是那樣熱情，也還是那樣議論風生；看到他，引起我許多許多往事的回憶，許多許多昆明的回味—呈貢的菓園，西山的峻峯，華亭寺茶花，翠湖旅館的冰結凌……</p>
<p>往事，一件跟着一件，終於，又談到了繪畫。</p>
<p>「我現在專畫魚」，他說。</p>
<p>「那不很好嗎？我相信，以你的聰明，畫的魚一定是不同凡響的」。這是眞話，在許多繪畫界的朋友中間，我一向佩服着他底聰明的。</p>
<p>「可是，我可給人駡死嘍」！最後兩個字還帶着昆明腔。</p>
<p>「爲什末呢」？我瞪着眼。</p>
<p>「還不是那一套」？他輕篾地一笑小鬚子歪向一邊，可，立即又恢復了，變得非常正經，「人家駡我想把西洋畫應用到中國畫上來，弄得不中不西！天知道，繪畫還不就是繪畫嗎？你瞧—」說着，他把手裏的一張五尺對開的單宣放開來，那上面是一枝芙蓉同十多條氽條魚，「這魚是我畫的，你能說有多少是西洋畫，有多少是中國畫嗎」？</p>
<p>我扭亮了燈，從他那激動得微微有點紅的臉，轉到這十多條魚：這是用透明的色彩，輕快的筆觸，以非常熟練的技巧，一揮而就地表現出來的；那些魚，正在很淸的水裏聚喋着一點什末。他底輕快活潑，自然的作風，在這類魚同他個人之間，是自然同他自己底產物。</p>
<p>「那有什末呢？你不很有把握地，把你直覺感到的自然底性靈表現出來了嗎？你所求的不也正是這個囑』。</p>
<p>他笑了。從他這笑裏，我又看到昆明，同時也看窓外正在開放的櫻花。</p>

<h3>題劉獅魚戀圖</h3>
<p>— 馬公愚</p>
<p>邂逅</p>
<p>依蒲生小兩潛英，驀見紅裳眼爲明，我比靑郞自更美，浣紗丙穴却逢卿。</p>
<p>追求</p>
<p>空潭育育一相於，知爾高書未化初，咫尺乘流羞避面，寗煩靑島寄丹書。</p>

<p>雙戲凌波此墊巾，笑他縮項有仙人，桃花千尺情千礨，占盡風光水底春。</p>
<p>成就</p>
<p>不須錦水羨鴛鴦，比目輕浮藻亦香，合體忽驚王室燬，江湖甲子豈相忘。</p>
<h3>大地之歌</h3>
<p>— 青果</p>
<p>花</p>
<p>大地富有着情感，大地開繁了花朵。</p>
<p>大地愛戰鬥，愛目由，愛生活，……</p>
<p>而花朶呢，便開着紅的，黃的，藍的……</p>
<p>如今到處都是紅的黃的藍的花朶啊重</p>
<p>年靑的人們喲，扔掉插在你胸前的那兩枝憂繼的悲傷的黑的白的花朶吧！</p>
<p>因爲，這醜惡的花朵就快要枯謝，而美麗的花朶已經榮茂起來了。</p>
<p>林</p>
<p>到處是忽　的林子。</p>
<p>大地有太多的林子：大地有綠油油的林子，有紅通通的林子；大地有黎明的林子，有太陽的林子；大地有年靑而結實的林子；大地有愛說愛笑的林子；……</p>
<p>當我走進任何一個林子時，我覺得牠們是那樣地奧秘而又神奇，深邃而又遼闊。</p>
<p>我覺得林子裏每一株樹簡直就是從大地的胸裏抽出來的一根根的思想。</p>
<p>所以，大地是最聰明不過的呵！</p>
<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭的自</p>
<p>最近紐約出了一種「哲學　書」，其中有羅曼羅蘭（Romain　Rolland）的自傳「內心的經歷」（Journey　Within）。這本自傳的斷片是給那些對於羅曼羅闌已經有興趣的人看的，不是給那些願意認識羅曼羅蘭的人看的。也就是說，這不是一本初步的常識書，這些斷片是印象的，有時且是神秘的，譯者配爾（Elsie　Pell）費了很大的氣力。</p>
<p>作者寫他的兒時，感覺到彼生活所囚禁。他說到他自己的多病，又說到他小妹之死給他很深的刺激，又說到他信仰斯實諾莎（Spinoza）的哲學，失去傳統的天主敎的信仰，說到他的祖先和他與父母的關係，他早年創作的嘗試，他畢生對於音樂的熱愛，他與羅馬的交涉，他對於約翰克利斯多夫這人物的創造，他與馬薇達（Malwida　von　Meysenburg）最後的友誼，他文學上的成功，第一次世界大戰對於他的影響等等。</p>
<p>馬薇達對於華格湼和尼采，馬志尼和赫爾岑頗爲熟悉，她舉起她那嚴冷而又平靜的手給年輕的羅涸，用她那知熱的眼睛熱情地望着他，他受了她很大的影響。他說：「馬薇達的戀愛給了我幫助。她那知慧的心讓你信賴你自己。光輝閃耀着，給你溫暖。我的精神因此有了新生的力量。她是了解你的朋友，創造你的朋友。」</p>
<p>這情形與他觀察羅馬是一樣的：「她不隱瞞她的秘密；也許她沒有秘密。但她顯示了你自己給你。凡知道她的，都不知道她，却發現了自己。」</p>
<p>，　曼　　的作品「白留格儂」（Colas　Breugnon）比那冗長笨重的「約翰克利斯多夫」要好。不過，後者即使是笨重的，可怕的，缺乏文體的優雅的，但這部鉅著的各部分，以及各部分的總和，用最大的忍耐以赴的，却是非常偉大的。作者除此書外，不再有這樣的創作力，也不再有這樣戰後的痛苦經驗。而當時巴里斯（Barres）和托馬斯曼都是反對他的。巴里斯吐出他的憤恨。托馬斯曼則根據德國文化來反對文明，甚至說：「人類因和平而退化。「懶惰的休息」是「勇敢」的墳墓。法律是弱者的朋友，法律的目的是使得世界平衡，戰爭即是力量。』</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭的力量是英勇的，他所受的壓力也特別的大。「約翰克利斯多夫」將使他永遠存在。</p>
<p>莫里雅克的兩部小說</p>
<p>法國大小說家莫里雅克（Francois　Mauriac，1885—）新近有兩部小說譯成英文：一部名叫「眭麗思」（Therese），還有一部名叫「毒蛇的繩結」（Vipers’Tangle）。</p>
<p>「眭麗思」是由四個故事合成的，兩籍較長，兩篇較短，同寫眭麗思這一位女主人公，寫作的時期各有先後，約從一九二七到一九三三，法文原本是分開來發行的，現在由譯者霍卜金斯（GerardHopkins）合在一起。</p>
<p>眭麗思的故事可說是罪與罰的故事。莫里雅克所研究的是他所深知的法國西南部。在第一個故事裏，開始於眭麗思被控有毒死丈夫白那德（Bernard）的企圖，剛被法庭官吿無罪，釋放出來。她正在途中計畫怎樣回家毒死她的丈夫。</p>
<p>後兩個故事中，她已經比以前長大了十一二歲。前者她幾乎發瘋，後者她向一個比她年靑的人求愛。前者寫得較差，後者較好，最好的該是最後的長篇小說「長夜的盡頭」（The　End　of　the　Night　1935）。她一生求愛，似乎都不成功。她很早就說過：「我不知道什麼叫做愛。這只是我時常願望的目的。這種目的佔有了我，蒙昧了我，讓我的腿放在廢地上，把我衝到牆壁上，逼我到泥淖裏去，讓我力竭在泥潭裏。」現在講到她女兒的生活。她的女兒也愛上了一個靑年，這正是她痛苦的考驗。這是殘酷的審判，重大的打擊，她的身心都崩潰了。後來她在監獄裏住了許多年。只有死能够使她解脫。她等待死，故事也就結束了。</p>
<p>這是否是莫里雅克最好的小說呢？按他在現代法國文壇的地位來說，這部作品雖很精緻，究竟不是純粹無疵的。第一部分寫女主角還有興趣，而且動人。最後的部分就不大使人滿意了。整個的結構缺乏人稱興和諧。</p>
<p>「毒蛇的了結」在法國出版於於一九三三，是一個瘋人的故事，大部分用日記體裁寫出。標題尤象徵的，總結的毒蛇象徵家庭目的互相嫉恨和主人公內心的錯綜情緒。像杜思退益夫斯基一樣，莫里雅克所寫的人物是複雜，含糊，不合邏輯的。一九三九年沙爾德（Jean—Paul　Sartre）尙未知名，就攻擊他所寫的人物只是被動的象棋中的傀儡。新近他又受到抗閔主義者的攻擊，說他是當吃飯的保守派的代言人。</p>
<p>小說家的他，受了杜思退益夫斯基的影響；詩人的他，受了波特萊爾的影響。他不愧爲世界最大的作家之一，他的兩本著作被譯成英文是値得慶幸的一件事。</p>

<h3>說「士」</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>不久之前，姜國曾有人呼籲中國的智識階級在動發的時局之中挺身而出，担當些責任，發生些作用。這事一方面是表示美國人的關切中國，另一方面是反映美國人的重視智識階級。</p>
<p>「智識階級」乃是一個新名調，我們原有類似的稱謂，叫做「士人」，或更通俗些，便是叫做「讀書人」。我國往昔也頗看重讀書的士人，但看「士農工商」四業，「士」竟高居首位。古盡里說的什麽「士可殺，不可辱」，也予「士」以特別崇高的地位，彷彿是說：屬於其他階級的人們是可以侮辱的，對於士人，即有差處，亦須予以特別老慮，不能隨便資罰。大槪也是爲了這種觀念所產生的結果吧，前淸秀才見官不必下跪行大禮，官亦不能隨便打秀才的屁股。</p>
<p>據筆者個人的意見，那樣的看重讀書的士人，未免有把士人的身份估計得太高之嫌。須知士人只是社會上許多階級中的一個階級，其所享地位不應較其他階級來得特別的高超。我國經過十年戰亂之後，事實上「士人」在社會上的地位也已經反了向，發生了大大的轉變。向之崇敬士人者，今日却頗有輕視士人的趨向；老其原因，不外於戰亂期中，人們最重生計，吃飯問題顯得分外的緊要，而士人對於生計問題最爲外行，於生存競爭的過程中，不免表演得毫無生氣；於幣値變動聲中，社會上大部分的人或囤貨，或投機，其中頗不乏發國難財勝利財的人士，而士人因爲「不事生產」的結果，自然不免淪爲窮讀盡人。査勢利乃是人類的天性，人們目擊那些暴發戶的榮華富貴，衣錦還鄕，對於那些窮讀書人自必譏之爲「窮酸」，心存看他不起之念了。愚意這也未免把士人的地位降落得過於低微，雖說此乃向昔過份重視士人的反動，可是矯枉過正却也是不必要的。</p>
<p>只是時至今日，我國的士人確實是面臨重大的危機，對於自身的立塲大有予以重新考慮的必要了。實在說來，往昔國人對於讀書人的崇敬，多少也包含些勢利的作用，因爲從前只有讀書的士人才可入朝做官，享受榮華富貴。其次，我國的讀書人乃是少數階級，「物以希爲貴」，士人乃被目爲社會上的特權份子。所以今日士人的降爲平民，喪失了原有的特殊地位，正也是社會自然進展的結果。</p>
<p>在這個大動盪時代，社會正在向前演進着，演進的路綫竟是採取什麽方向，我們雖然無法預言，可是有一點是毫無疑義的，那就是：只吃飯不做事，只知享受不知盡應盡之義務的時代終歸是要消逝的。而我國的所謂士人階級，大體說來，却正是享受多於工作的有閑階級。社會演進的最高理想是「各盡所能，各取所需」，我們試問我國的士人，除了少數的博學鴻儒還能著些不切實際的書，立些虛無空洞之說之外，究竟有些什麽「德」，有些什麽「能」呢？和尙念念經，打打佛坐，自知只是社會上的消費者，故而茹素，穿百枘衣，一切力求簡約，而我國的十人雖說並非眞的「手無縛鷄之力」，可是他們之中的大多數對於社會的供獻却正與出家的和尙相等，而所要求的享受却有十百倍於和尙者。其不合理，灼然可見。這點是我們士人階級所應該自省的。</p>
<p>固然，古人對於士人在社會上的功用有一套動人的解辯，說是士人一方面享受了人民所供給的衣食住，同時也在席不暇暖地替人民興利除害，人民因而可以安居樂業，下必再爲政治上的事操心；準此而論，士人之與其他階級，乃是一種分工合作的關係。此說在理論上固然講得通，可是我們要知道：士人之所以自成一個階級，只是敎育不普及的結果；將來一旦敎育普及，人們都有讀書的機會，人們都將成爲士人；到了那時，又是一個怎樣的局面呢？據筆者看來，將來的士人如果不另謀發展，純粹以士人的地位爲出發點，其主要的出路不外二種，第一是以其所學敎後學，這便是執敎，往昔叫做坐館；第二便是「學而優則仕」，此即是做官。可是事實上那裏會有這麽許多執敎或做官的空額呢？</p>
<p>是故時至今日，士人必須另謀出路，只憑空洞的士人名義，在將來的社會里是絕對不會有發展的希望的，因爲士人階級將來必歸消滅。在理想的社會里，農工商學兵都將是士人，因之士人必須同時或農或工或商或學或兵，方可不致成爲社會上的寄生蟲。</p>
<h3>葡人經商</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>在淸代，葡萄牙一人每年用大帆船和圓形船，結隊航行至里斯本，滿載毛織物，玻璃精製品，英國及佛　德出產的鐘錶，以及葡萄牙本國出產的葡萄酒；然後遍訪各地海港，換取各種物品。</p>
<p>船從哥亞航行至愛琴，換取香料和寳石；自愛琴到麻六甲，換取香料和白檀；續航至中國澳門，換取絲織品；再轉往日本，換取金銀塊；於是折返澳門，接着就滿載金，銀，麝香，珍珠，象牙精製品，細工木器，漆磁器，以及絲織品等，回到歐洲。</p>
<h3>漲價好</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>明天是四月一日，聽說照像要加價了，我把這驚人的消息在家里一說，隨即湊了三十萬元，當夜趕到照像館，爲我自己並兩個妹妹各洗照片半打。這件事郤是「人同此心」，照像館里生意興隆，熱鬧非凡。</p>
<p>今晚做了這一件事，明天漲價讓他漲，干我甚事，歸家途中，我心中感到一種「討了便宜」的安慰。</p>
<p>仔細想來，我們平常對任何物價的波動不也是如此麼？每當聞悉了某物要漲價的消息後，總是拼命購買，唯恐後人，於是這種商品立刻銷售一空，向隅者自認晦氣。</p>
<p>試思世界上有什麽廣吿的效力能够比得上「漲價」二字？只要喊一聲「漲價」的預備口令，或是作一個「漲價」的預備態勢，保險你的貨品很快地傾銷一空，鈔票堆積如山，不但消極方面可省郤大筆的廣吿費，並目積極方面，其招徠顧客的效力猶勝過普通花錢的廣吿萬倍。這就老闆的立塲說，當然是「漲價好」。而在顧客方面呢？買了漲價前的貨，算是佔了便宜，若並不漲價，反而覺得自己並沒有佔便宜，故就買者的立塲說，也是覺得「漲價好」。至於那些「緩足後登」的向隅者們呢？不要緊，暫且把漲了價的貨品買來吧，不久貨品價格再漲，則你前此員下來的彼時的漲了價的貨，此時又是便宜的了，這時的你，豈不感到一種「佔了便宜」的愉快！這樣說來，漲價總是好的。</p>
<p>反之，跌價便怎樣呢？商店老闆吃了　不用說，而買主也不見得舒服。買主爲什麽不舒服呢？我也可舉出一個身歷其境的實例來說明：昨夭學校開始補發公賣回學二月份的食米每人二斗三升，許多公費同學因現是在學校寄膳的，故大都把此二斗三升米賣掉，我也收買了一份，價五十七萬五千元，合每石二百五十萬元，我得意洋洋，覺得佔了便宜。那知今天同學們賣出，都是每份五十萬元，竟比昨天跌價了，我便感到昨天吃了虧，心里的確有點不舒服。假如今天他們賣六十萬元，那我一定要慶幸自己買了便宜貨了。這一件事，也可反證「漲價好」。</p>
<p>漲價旣有如許之好，爲什麼不好漲呢？</p>

<p>— 霜</p>
<p>美國的外交只重頭腦不重脚，——道威斯計劃作者C·G。道威斯——</p>
<p>坦白而明瞭——哄人與惑人之術盡在於此。——英國名相B·狄斯拉里</p>
<p>世界上有三種動物，當他們似乎要來的時候，其實是去了，當他們似乎要去的時候，其實是來了。一種是外交家，一種是女人，還有一種是螃蟹。——首創門戶開放政策的海·約翰</p>
<p>一個大使便是一個被派到外國去爲了他國家的利益面專門說謊的老實人。——H·伍頓爵士</p>
<p>我發現了欺騙外交家的藝術了。我只要說實話，他們便永遠不會相信我。——C·。凱諾</p>
<p>當一個外交說「是」的時候，他的意思是「也許」，當他說「也許」的時候，他的意思是「不」，而會說「不」的人便決非外交家。</p>
<p>最緊要的是：（一）勿設不豪華之宴，（二）多多留意女人。——拿破崙任米恩大主敎爲駐英大使時的訓辭</p>
<p>外交家幸而都有長鼻子，因爲他們的眼光常不能超過鼻子以外。——前法國駐美大使P·克勞台</p>
<h3>從理想到實踐</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>差不多每一種重大的發明都受過思想保守的人們的阻礙。萊特兄弟第一次架機昇空之後六個月，一個著名的美國科學家還大言不慚的說飛行是不可能的。愛迪生的第一次電燈一試驗，被「斯蒂文司工藝硏究院」的院長喝了倒采，說那次試臉是「失敗的」。……當德國建築第一條鐵路的時候，醫生們莊重的說：火車的每小時十五哩的快速度會使乘客的血從眼睛，嘴巴和耳朶迸出來。</p>
<p>這種反對改變的偉為見常是由那些認爲改變會使他們花錢的人們所堅持的。資方和勞方同等的反對新的機器和新的方法。英國的馬車行主人們用可笑的法律排斥掉第一輛蒸汽汽車。在義大利佛羅蘭斯，當一部份商人初次採用阿拉伯數字記服的時候，其他的商人認爲這種節省時間的記數方法，對自己大爲不利，他們沒有想到放棄不便的羅馬數字也去學阿拉伯數字，却於一二九九年制定了法律，禁止使用阿拉伯數字。</p>
<p>在一種新思想的產生與被廣泛的使用之間當有一大段時間的距離。有人分析一八八八年與一九一三年之間的十九樣主要的發明的結果，平均是：從觀念的產生到具體的模型的造成相隔一百七十六年。第一次實地的應用又落後了二十四年。眞正的成為商品還在一百七十四年之後，而要變成社會上的必需品還得十二年的時間。</p>
<p>這一大段時間上的距離，是社會上大多數的人所造成的。人類早已養成了惰性，不但絆住了自己的脚，也妨礙了少數的先知先覺者。</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>

<p>天氣——某種人談話的惟一素材。俗云「靠天吃飯」，「聽天由命」，誰曰不然？</p>
<p>如果向日葵是親日派，那麽雁來紅，楓樹，和月月紅必係赤黨無疑，埀楊柳不知「左傾」，柳係「右傾」？尙有待證實。牡丹乃花中之王，帝國主辦是也，幽蘭有王者之香，顯係封建之餘毒猶存。——「人能解語誠多事」，花在嘆息了。</p>
<p>樹枝上的蟬，三不管的整天喊着「知了，知了」，明明不知道的，牠還拼命「知了」；—唱高調。</p>
<p>驕傲的兎子，在賽跑的途程中，睡了一覺，結果被烏種勝利了。</p>
<p>其實，假使牠早一點醒來，或許還來得及的。——不，一定來得及的。</p>
<p>花謝了，香氣就沒有了；人死了，他的芬芳却仍在，並且永在。——假使他果有芬芳的話。</p>
<p>簾外的桃花特別美，隔着一段距離去看人，也特別可愛。</p>

<p>渚齋知道鳳笙向來沒有主張，一定聽了韓玉的話，所以才能如此堅決，今天前來所得的結果，可說仍等於零，雲卿認爲她那封信，是有力量的，現在仍是沒效果，我不如再到雲卿家裏，把經過情形吿訴她，求她想法子，雲卿是心熱面冷的人，我再三求她，她一定能諒解我。渚齋默默坐在椅上，靜想了好一會，覺得這事，除了向雲卿麻煩外，沒有別的辦法，當下嘆一口氣道：「你們如此決心，我也沒話可說了。鳳笙你能自立，我非常贊成，將來你需要我帮忙的地方，我仍盡我的義務。」鳳笙道：「我不需要你帮忙。」韓玉忙插嘴道：「不是這麼說，彼此都應該帮忙，徐先生帮忙鳳笙，鳳笙也帮忙徐先生，你們二位，表面上各奔前途，精神上仍是共同合作的。我希望你們二位，各鼓起精神來，努力前進，預祝你們成功。」鳳笙和渚齋的僵局，總算給韓玉這幾句話打破，二人心中雖然都含着悲楚，可是經韓玉這樣一說，都勉强現出一點笑容，答謝她的好意。渚齋趁此時機站了起來，向韓玉點點頭道：「承你好意，很感謝你！」又對鳳笙點點頭道：「我希望你自己保重，我離開北平以前，還要來看你，就是我離開北平以後，也要寫信給你。」鳳笙只木木站在那裏，一句話不說，不知她心裏是難過，還是怨恨。渚齋見她毫無表示，只好說聲再見，辭了出去，心裏很惆悵，覺得鳳笙這人平日是毫無主張，很容易打動她的熱情，改換她的觀念，不想她會認識這位韓小姐，給她出主意，現在她已給韓玉抓住了，要想再改變她的心理，是不可能的，我且把這情形，吿訴雲卿，看她還有何妙計，她若束手無策，我再麻煩她，最後她總不能拒絕我，她對我情感很深，總不能置之不顧。渚齋想定主意，便僱一輛三輪車，一直趕到雲卿家裏。</p>
<h3>薩公大慶（上）</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>關老將軍一副慈祥和隅像南海音薩的尊容（見三月廿一申報第二版），又與吾人相見。他幾乎被世人遺忘了，而實在是最値得記憶的一位老人。他是武人，比文人還溫文爾雅，他是貴宦，比平民選樸素，一切都來得別致！</p>
<p>老人今年九十大慶，「人生七十古來希」，七十已是「古希」，何況八十？何況九十？真乃希而又希。官場老資格就眼前可指者而言，居住上海的前淸直隸總督陳夔龍氏，今年九十二歲，這一文一武，可算是兩顆老人星，，都是前淸的一品大員。（陳氏於勝利後，尙有通電爲其舊主溥君緩頰，此人似尙健在。）</p>
<p>老人是上將是老帥，當年威風八面，三軍司命。但一世不留鬍鬚。所以徐世昌總統任內命老薩代理國務總理，報上有打油詩曰：「老且登台薩鎭冰」，言其如戲劇中楊老令婆（余太君）之登台點將也。即如此間已九秩大老矣，而唇邊頷下，依然濯濯牛山，假使不註明「薩公鎭冰」未必不以爲誰家的一位老太太。（彼時北方政界以「沒鬍子」著名者二人，一即薩翁，一爲王式通書衡氏，即王蔭泰的父親。又以「大鬍子」著名者二人，一爲孫寳琦慕韓，曾任袁時外交總長，曹錕時之國務總理；一即王捐唐王大鬍子。）</p>
<p>老人於十餘年前，忽有北游壯舉，時人以其退讓故里多年，或於舊京不無依戀，但出人意外的是他於平津無所勾留，却到長城以外西北荒寒之地，兜了一個大圈子。常日寇肆擾「滿蒙」之際，或疑其有何調査使命，而與其閒冷之身世亦不相符。後來會到陳翁幼庸（亦閩人，亦海軍界耆宿），談起原來老人是專爲修墓於紫台期漠之區。薩氏在閩一大姓，而在全國姓氏譜錄則爲一冷姓。蓋最初是成吉斯汗所部，因忽必賚之統一中原，分地駐伍，同化於閩，遂爲漢人。歷史上此例正自不乏，亦不止此一姓爲然也。（三國有薩摩柯，元代大臣有薩敦，皆是譯音，薩姓原文當不止一字。）</p>
<p>從前北洋諸將，老段老馮等等，都是飛揚跋扈，一團火氣。而老薩則長是一團和氣，一臉善氣，雖是武人的魁首，比文人還來得溫文爾雅。徐世昌所以命他爲總理，亦因其時政潮澎湃，那些鋒芒無比的政客官僚們獲奪不休，閙得幾乎全面坍台，只好請他暫支局面。別人搶奪政權的時候，老薩不聞不問，老徐請他出馬，他亦不讓不推，說好便好，無可無不可，各方面對他無惡感無妬意，都認爲好好先生，和事老人。按舊式官僚出個好好先生原不足奇，而在海軍大將則不能不認爲特別了。楊小樓是武行泰斗而台風文雅過於文生，時人謂之武戲文做，老　的作風亦頗彷彿。</p>

<h3>National Assembly Enters Formal Agenda: First Meeting Yesterday Discussed Rules of Procedure; Presidium Requested to Prepare for Presidential Election</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Assembly held its first meeting on the morning of the 6th, entering its formal agenda. The first group of the presidium took turns presiding, with Chairman Yu Youren presiding. At 9:25 AM, he announced the opening of the meeting. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported on the method of the presidium taking turns as chairmen and the group lists. The chairmen of the first group of the presidium successively took the stage, and Hong also took office amidst applause. The entire assembly then stood up to observe a moment of silence for revolutionary martyrs, fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance and Suppression of Rebellion, and deceased compatriots. The assembly then proceeded to discuss the draft rules of procedure, chapter by chapter. In the first chapter, "General Principles," regarding the confidentiality obligation for unpublished documents, some representatives believed that it should be determined at any time which matters must be kept secret, and that confidentiality obligations should also be stipulated for assembly staff. Regarding Article 5 concerning the holding of preparatory meetings, it was considered appropriate to move it to Chapter 3 and add a new article to Chapter 1, stipulating that the National Assembly should listen to government policy reports and make recommendations when it convenes. Regarding Chapter 2, "Review of Representative Qualifications," some representatives believed that since certificates had already been verified and photos checked upon registration, they should be deemed qualified, and there was no need for a second review, so this chapter should be deleted. In Chapter 3, "Meetings," the number of extensions of waiting time due to insufficient quorum had already been stipulated as two, but some representatives believed that the length of each extension should also be specified, and that there should also be restrictions on the point that mid-meeting departures do not affect the calculation of quorum. Chapter 4 was "Proposals." Article 17, "The scope of proposals is limited to matters related to the provisions of Article 27 of the Constitution," was again opposed by a majority of representatives, who generally believed that the National Assembly's powers are clearly enumerated in the Constitution and should not be arbitrarily restricted by the rules of procedure. Some advocated expanding the scope of proposals, while others advocated deleting it, but their goal was to empower the National Assembly to inquire into political and national affairs. The meeting paused briefly at 10:50 AM for a break. After gathering backstage, the presidium resumed the meeting at 11:25 AM. At this moment, the capital's power plant took advantage of the assembly's break to switch power supply lines, and there were only a few small lights inside the entire venue, making the light dim. Chairman Yu then consulted the opinions of the assembly and announced the adjournment. However, due to the suddenness of the matter, some representatives did not understand the reason for the adjournment and gathered to question the chairman, causing a minor disturbance again. All the representatives finally left the venue at noon. (The picture shows Yu Youren reporting the situation.)</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The first meeting of the National Assembly will be held all day on the 7th. The second and third sessions will be held at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM respectively. The presidium decided on the 6th that the second and third groups would take turns presiding, with Gu Zhenggang, Zhang Fang, and He Zhonghan respectively presiding. In addition to the secretariat's report of documents, the presidium decided on the 6th that the deadline for proposals to the assembly would be noon on the 10th, and a report would be submitted. In addition to continuing the discussion of the rules of procedure that was not completed on the 6th, the organizational regulations of the Representative Qualification Review Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the general rules for the organization of the Proposal Review Committee are also prepared for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] After the National Assembly enters its formal agenda, the election of the President and Vice President will proceed. The presidium of the assembly has prepared to submit a motion requesting the assembly to decide on the dates for the election of the President and Vice President and the deadline for joint nomination of candidates, so as to prepare in advance. According to the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the President should be elected first, followed by the Vice President, and the names of the candidates should be announced three days before the election.</p>

<h3>Civil Aviation Aircraft Attack Incident: We Will Lodge Final Protest</h3>
<p>Soviet Reply Under Study by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on the 6th that the Soviet Union's second reply to our protest regarding the attack on an Air Transport Corps aircraft over the Bohai Sea by a Soviet aircraft was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Soviet Embassy on the evening of the 3rd. Its content is the same as that announced by Moscow. The reply was reviewed by senior officials on the 5th after spending the weekend at the Ministry, so the Ministry was unable to confirm this matter on the 5th. The spokesperson also said: The Ministry is currently studying the reply and may issue a further reply, lodging a final protest. According to reporters, there are several points of contention that are difficult to resolve: (1) The Soviet Union stubbornly insists that the markings of the attacked aircraft were unclear, which is a sophistry. (2) The Soviet Union stubbornly insists that the attacked aircraft flew over the airspace of the Lushun Naval Base twice, while we assert that the aircraft did not fly over the base, and even if it had, it was within our sovereign airspace and should have the freedom to do so. (3) The Soviet Union believes that according to the agreement on Lushun Port in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet military command has the right to force down aircraft with unclear markings, but we believe that our aircraft have the right to free navigation in our sovereign airspace, and the aircraft of the Air Transport Corps have clear markings, so there is no reason to accept the Soviet aircraft's order to force down for inspection. (4) The Soviet reply further requires that in the future, if our aircraft fly over the Lushun base, we should notify the Soviet military command stationed in Hong Kong in advance, which we believe is unnecessary for civilian aircraft during peacetime unless there is a war between the two countries against Japan, in which case it is technically necessary, and it is especially unnecessary to land.</p>

After repeated consideration, we respectfully suggest to the conference that, in accordance with the unanimous expression of yesterday, the President should still be invited to be the candidate for the first President, and we hope that all our party comrades will abide by the President's instructions, support the President's decisions, and work together sincerely. No matter in politics or society, we will not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves to carry out the party's spirit of saving the country and complete the great cause of suppressing rebellion and building the country. We respectfully ask the conference to adopt this opinion and make a resolution, so that all party comrades can follow it consistently. Whether it is appropriate, please decide."</p>
<h3>Fire at Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang: Property Loss of 500 Billion; Over 20 Monks Jumped Into the Fire to Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 6th] Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang, which is famous throughout the universe, known to every household, and praised as the only Buddhist holy site in the southeast, suffered a major fire at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The fire burned for five hours, destroying more than 100 halls and buildings of the Jinshan Temple. The precious scriptures stored in the Sutra Repository were completely destroyed. The fire spread rapidly. About twenty monks who gave their lives to the temple and committed suicide by jumping into the fire. Public and private property losses amounted to about 500 billion, which is an unprecedented disaster. When the fire started in the temple's warehouse, this newspaper's reporter was accompanying colleagues from the Beijing-Shanghai reporters' group on a tour of the mountain, preparing to interview the abbot of the temple. The fire was reported, so they rushed to the front of the temple to inspect. They witnessed black smoke rising slowly when the fire started. When the first manually pulled fire truck (Xiaobailong) arrived at the scene at 3:50 PM, the flames had already reached the Grand Hall. In a moment, the fire spread rapidly. Before 5:00 PM, the Water and Land Hall, Baoguang Building, Ziyou Hall, Grand Hall, Miaogao Terrace, Xionghua Hall, and Liuyu Pavilion of the temple were all turned to ashes. When the fire spread, although the Heqiao Police Station in charge sent police officers to requisition trucks and respond to a large number of two-legged water dragons to the scene to put out the fire, the flames could not be suppressed. Until late at night, all the firefighters were biting dry food and holding gasoline lamps, trying to put out the fire. When thousands of lights were lit, most of this ancient temple had been reduced to ashes. It is comforting to the world that the seven-story ancient pagoda that reaches to the sky and the Fahai Cave, whose mythology is still passed down, still stand tall on the riverbank and are fortunately unscathed. According to Master Taicang of the temple, since the Jin and Liang Dynasties, the god of fire has visited the temple seven times. However, each time it was burned in the past, it was rebuilt. But I don’t know when it will be repaired after the disaster today. Furthermore, Monk Taicang tried to jump into the fire to commit suicide, but was stopped by someone and did not get to bury himself in the fire pit.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of the National Assembly: First Day of Formal Agenda!</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper (Nanjing, April 6th)</p>
<p>The milestone of the National Assembly has informed us that today marks the first day of entering the formal agenda of the Assembly. The first session this morning, waiting to meet the legal quorum, and due to a temporary malfunction of the lights in the venue, opened late and adjourned early, totaling eighty-five minutes. Among them, reading the minutes of the sixth preparatory meeting, reporting a series of names and votes of the presidium election results, routine congratulatory telegrams, delegates' leave requests, and the Secretary-General's report on the results of the presidium meeting took up another twenty minutes. Therefore, the time officially spent on discussing proposals today was one hour and five minutes. The meeting started at 9:25 AM and the recess started at 10:50 AM. After the chairman announced the continuation of the meeting, he immediately announced the adjournment time as 11:25 AM. Subsequently, the adjournment issue caused a commotion. Some people believed that the Assembly Hall had almost become a powder keg, which could easily cause an accident and explosion. Today was just a small fuse. Fortunately, the storm was only fierce when it came, and soon the wind subsided and the rain stopped, and it was over.</p>
<p>The Assembly began to discuss the draft rules of procedure, which were divided into thirteen chapters with sixty-six articles. Yu Youren first asked the delegates to express their opinions extensively. Twenty-two people spoke successively. There were not many opinions on the first three chapters, but the fourth chapter hit a snag. The delegates focused on the national courtesy of the National Assembly. In the general rules of the first chapter, some people proposed that "During the National Assembly, the government's policy reports should be listened to, and inquiries and suggestions should be made." Article 17 of the fourth chapter on proposals stated, "The scope of proposals is limited to those related to the provisions of Article 27 of the Constitution." Most speakers felt that the restriction was too harsh. Yu Jichuan cried out loudly, "We are representatives of the people. We should understand all kinds of problems before us and be able to express our opinions. All proposals related to politics, society, culture, military affairs, and economy can be discussed." Lin Bin believed that Article 17 should be deleted because Article 27 of the Constitution has already stipulated the power to amend the Constitution. Anything that hinders the implementation of the Constitution can be proposed for discussion and amendment. However, Article 27 does not include the entire power of the National Assembly. Therefore, some problems, such as the issue of the session, cannot be submitted according to the provisions of Article 17. For example, the Constitution stipulates that an extraordinary session can be convened to set a date. If we cannot propose a discussion in the Assembly, it will be difficult to convene and will be held indefinitely. Therefore, Lin Bin said that this becomes a situation where the power exists but there is no time to implement it. This Assembly is the first Assembly and will also become the last Assembly. His conclusion was that Article 17 should be deleted. His clear explanation won several rounds of warm applause. Because in his speech, first, he removed the restrictions on proposals in the rules of procedure, and second, he reminded everyone to stipulate the date of the extraordinary session in the Assembly.</p>
<p>The speakers continued to criticize the restrictions imposed on proposals by Article 17, expressing disagreement. Hua Shousong said that the provisions of this article are tantamount to restraining our opinions and proposals. For example, if there is a change in the territory, we cannot discuss it in the Assembly? So I think it should be amended to "limited to the powers conferred on the National Assembly by the Constitution."</p>
<p>Secondly, some people believed that the current National Assembly should be discussed, but Article 17 could not include it. Huang Yiming said that the issue of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion should be included in the discussion. Others said that according to the provisions of Article 17, it would almost become "no discussion of national affairs." Finally, Guo Hongxiang, a representative from the Northeast, spoke generously. He said, "We want to listen to the report on national affairs, and we want to submit the issue of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country for discussion. We must know what the situation is in the Northeast when we are meeting here today?" Representative Guo's words were full of enthusiasm and power, and the atmosphere of the meeting was tightened by him. Finally, he shouted, "The country is about to perish. This Assembly should be an Assembly to suppress the rebellion and build the country." He shouted and slammed the table, arousing a lot of sympathy. The extensive expression of opinions is only the first day, and the general opinion is to expand the power of the National Assembly and relax the limits of proposals.</p>
<p>The Assembly adjourned for a break at 10:50 AM. Here, an unexpected episode suddenly occurred. The lights in the venue malfunctioned and went out during the break. The entire venue was illuminated only by the light of a few small lamps, which naturally hindered the progress of the Assembly. Therefore, the break was repeatedly extended until the meeting resumed at 11:25 AM, but the lights were still not on. So Chairman Yu Youren began by reporting that the lights were out. Could the meeting be adjourned early? Only because Elder Yu's voice was slightly low, the delegates did not hear clearly, so most of them adopted an attitude of neither agreeing nor opposing. Elder Yu believed that everyone acquiesced, so he announced the adjournment. Who knew that the mischievous lights came back on after the adjournment was announced, and the entire venue was brightly lit. More than two thousand delegates upstairs and downstairs immediately rioted, questioning, "Why was the meeting adjourned?" A group of representatives rushed to the chairman's platform, with a menacing momentum, "Why was the meeting adjourned?" "It must be intentional, thinking that we want to discuss some cases, so we acted rashly." "Too casual." Representative Lin Zigui was particularly agitated, jumping on the podium and shouting, "We will hold our own meeting and elect another chairman." Most of the representatives did not understand why the meeting was adjourned early, and even less why Representative Lin was so excited. So the upstairs and downstairs were in chaos. Because the chairman had already announced the adjournment, there was no need to make a temporary change, so he left the meeting first, leaving behind a mess. Secretary-General Hong used his hoarse voice to explain "Why was the meeting adjourned," but no one could hear his voice, and it was a noisy mess. Finally, Zhang Shouxian's persuasion led Lin Zigui to shout, "Okay, bring it up for discussion at the Assembly tomorrow." This little fuse was only "unheard," but Representative Lin's words were not wrong, "After holding a meeting for more than an hour, the people don't know what we are doing?"</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Crossroads of Division and Reunion in Korea</h3>
<p>The work of the United Nations Commission on Korea in Seoul can be said to have completely failed. Commission Chairman Menon and Secretary-General Hu Shih-tse have already left Korea together. Representatives from Canada and Australia also firmly opposed the Commission's supervision of the May 10th elections and criticized the Little General Assembly for making this suggestion as "unwise and contrary to the Charter." Just as the Commission was on the verge of disintegration, the Soviet occupying forces command in North Korea issued invitations to leaders of various parties, right-wing, left-wing, and centrist, in South Korea, urging them to hold a pan-Korean political party conference in North Korea on April 14th to discuss the establishment of a Korean government. Currently, various political parties in South Korea are holding meetings and tests. Except for the Democratic Party led by Syngman Rhee and Kim Seong-soo, which is willing to participate in the May 10th elections, all other political parties, whether left-wing or centrist, unanimously oppose separate elections. As for whether the political parties in South Korea will participate in the political party conference hosted by North Korea on April 14th, or whether they will coordinate and unite after participating, it is still difficult to judge at this time. However, the development of this new situation in Korea illustrates the failure of the work of the United Nations Commission on Korea and the miscalculation of the US military's policy of conducting elections in South Korea.</p>
<p>The organization of the United Nations Commission on Korea is based on the resolution of the General Assembly, and this resolution came from the US proposal. The Commission, with representatives from nine countries as its core, was joined by eight countries after Ukraine refused to participate. Their motivation was to promote US-Soviet coordination with a neutral attitude, to reasonably solve the Korean issue, and thereby lift the shackles of the Korean people. After the Commission arrived in Seoul, the ideal became a bubble. They felt disappointed with the US military's ruling policy in South Korea and also had a poor impression of the leaders of some political parties in South Korea. And the political parties in North Korea, under the control of the Soviet Union, were not only unwilling to cooperate with South Korea, but even refused to cooperate with the Commission. Menon's request to go to North Korea to observe and explore the intentions of various political parties was also rejected by North Korea. Menon felt that this trip was completely useless, so he returned to Lake Success on February 24th to report to the Little General Assembly, hoping to open the deadlock through other routes. The United States' attitude was quite firm, suggesting to the Little General Assembly that separate elections be held in South Korea, electing two-thirds of the national representatives in South Korea, and reserving one-third of the representatives to wait for North Korea to participate. This proposal was passed on the 26th, but still did not receive the support of the Soviet Union and its five satellite states. It is worth noting the opposition of the two Committee countries, Canada and Australia. Canada is very concerned that separate elections will easily lead to the division of Korea and accelerate the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. They also seem to be very suspicious of the popularity of Syngman Rhee and his colleagues. Hodge, the commander of the US military in Seoul, announced May 9th (later changed to May 10th) as the election date for South Korea after the Little General Assembly resolution was passed, and asked the Commission to be responsible for supervision. Before the Little General Assembly resolution was passed, the opinions of the Committee countries were still consistent, but after the resolution was passed, differences arose. Canada and Australia expressed disappointment, and the representatives from China and India quietly left, and the Committee was virtually suspended.</p>
<p>The tragedy of Korea was caused by the United States and the Soviet Union. Korea is weak, and the pitiful 30 million people are still separated by the 38th parallel, without any contact with each other. We sympathize with the plight of Korea and do not attach importance to the failure of the Commission's work. If the political parties in South Korea truly insist on refusing to participate in the May 10th elections, the Soviet Union will naturally not suddenly declare North Korea's independence. Then, the people of North and South Korea should seize this opportunity, be self-conscious, break through the shackles of the United States and the Soviet Union, and extend hands of peace and friendship to cooperate and unite together, so that the tragedy of Greece will not appear in Korea. We have repeatedly argued that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Now the time has come. Politicians from North and South Korea should no longer linger on the idea of "serving Qi or serving Chu" and lose the opportunity to strengthen themselves and survive. Recently, the "Korean Public Opinion Association" in Seoul conducted a Korean public opinion test. Only 5% of the people supported South Korea's separate elections, while 71% of the people supported negotiations between the key figures of the political parties in North and South Korea to unify the country, which is enough to clearly show the intention of the people of South Korea to eagerly unify the North and South. Under the control of the Soviet army in North Korea, there is no genuine expression of public opinion, but it is clear without judgment that the intelligent and creative Koreans, their blood relationship determines their common will to survive. The idea of Korean independence was originally undifferentiated between North and South Korea. Except for the bad tendencies of a few people, it is believed that the conscience of the vast majority of Koreans is to be united.</p>
<p>China and Korea have close relations. For the future peace of the Far East, we strongly support Korea to be united. Now the dawn of peace and unity in Korea is near. We hope that the politicians of North and South Korea, outside the unfree atmosphere of Seoul and Pyongyang, will gather to negotiate a way to unify the country and not disappoint the neighbors and the vast number of people. Chinese historical philosophy has pointed out the fate of small states. The only way is to constantly strive for self-improvement in order to survive in the world. "Serving Qi or serving Chu?" This is the question of a small state. Serving Qin or serving Chu has the risk of being annexed. If they are not deceived by Qi or Chu, they should strive to strengthen themselves as a righteous country. Mencius said, "Now, if a small state wins by extending its strengths and making up for its shortcomings, and becomes fifty li long, it can still become a large state." Today, Korea has 220,000 square kilometers of land, which is more than one-third of the total area of Japan, and six times our Taiwan Province; a population of 30 million, with thicker endowment than the Japanese and a greater wealth than Taiwan. If it is independent and self-reliant, it will definitely make a good contribution to the peace and stability of the Far East. Therefore, we must awaken the vigilance of the United States and the Soviet Union: a peaceful and independent Korea can serve as a buffer between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the United States and the Soviet Union want to avoid war in the Far East, they should withdraw from Korea, watch Korea's independent reunification, and make it a corridor of peace in the Far East, not a powder keg. The military experts of the United States and the Soviet Union are vying to control the Korean Peninsula according to the theory of geopolitics. This is not a way to avoid war. This is self-immolation, not burning others. The powerful political power should be cautious.</p>

<p>China Trust Bureau will Devote Efforts to Make Up</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 6th Electric] Since the war, the total trade between the Chinese and Japanese governments is estimated at 400,000 US dollars.

<h3>The Mystery of Mount Jishi</h3>
<p>Rumor that American Pilots Secretly Explored it, Height Approximately 23,500 Feet</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 6th Electric] Hua Peng, director of the Boston Museum of America, one of the American founders of the "Mount Jishi Exploration Team," arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th and visited Dr. Sa Benlian of the Central Research Institute. The Chinese scientists currently stranded in Lanzhou include Luo Kaifu, Xu Jinzhi, and Sun Dian. There are also one reporter and three liaison officers. Reynolds' absurd behavior has aroused unanimous dissatisfaction and condemnation from all walks of life in China and the United States. According to reports from authoritative sources, the reason why Reynolds hurriedly left China twice was because since Reynolds advocated "taking risks," an American pilot from the Central Air Transport Corporation flew a plane from Lanzhou to Dihua and secretly explored Mount Jishi, which is approximately 23,500 feet high, while Mount Everest is 29,918 feet high. Reynolds and his driver Orton have heard about this rumor. Reynolds still intends to try. His first secret departure from China may have been intended to fly to Mount Jishi for exploration, using flying to India as a cover. His second use of "test flight" as a pretext was to escape long ago.</p>

<h3>What is He Wuwang Dezhen? The Wife of a Village Head Was Frightened to Death. Self-Government Personnel in Changzhou Demand Reasonable Protection</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Wujin dispatch on the 5th] Jiu Bao in Jianhu Township, Qishuyan District, in response to the second phase of conscription, Zheng Chao was introduced to serve as a volunteer soldier. After the family allowance was collected, including guarantor Liang Shufen's share, and was about to be handed over, at about 10:00 AM on the 30th of last month, Wang Dezhen, who claimed to be the platoon leader of the search company of the 48th Regiment of the Second Reserve Brigade of the Army stationed in Tangshan, Nanjing, suddenly arrived at the Jianhu Township Office with a squad leader, carrying a Thompson submachine gun. He claimed that he was ordered to arrest Zheng Chao, a deserter. His tone was fierce, so Township Head Wu clarified the situation and sent someone with a note to find Liu Guoliang, the village head of Jiu Bao. As Liu was not at home, his wife, Zhou, received them. Unexpectedly, Wang Dezhen acted rudely, and without asking for details, he roared loudly and led the squad leader into the house to search everywhere. After about an hour, nothing was found, so he declared that he would take Zhou and He, the wife of the Jia (neighborhood) head of the Bao, to Nanjing.

<h3>International Conference on Freedom of the Press Prevents Malicious Reporting. Grotowski's Rage</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent of this newspaper, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Geneva airmail dispatch, March 30th] The Conference on Freedom of the Press has entered its second stage. The plenary session has ended, and the focus has shifted to the subcommittees. The Chinese delegation also has a "division of labor" method for handling the subcommittees. Chief representative Zhang Pengchun himself serves on the General Committee, which is usually called the "Steering Committee" in the United Nations General Assembly mechanism, equivalent to the "Presidium" commonly used in China. The General Committee decides on the rules of procedure, regulations, and other technical issues that do not belong to freedom of the press. Most of the debates are diplomatic in nature. In addition to the General Committee, there are four subcommittees discussing freedom of the press: the First Committee discusses the principles and theories of freedom of the press, and the Chinese delegation recommends Cheng Cangbo to attend. The Second Committee discusses the collection and dissemination of freedom of the press, and Deng Youde attends. The Third Committee discusses free publication and free [blank space] announcement, and [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] attends. The Fourth Committee discusses the long-term [blank space] structure and organization of freedom of the press of the United Nations, and Ma Xingye attends.</p>
<p>William Benton Speaks, Emphasizing Rationality and Morality</p>
<p>Representative William Benton gave a speech in the First Committee that was appreciated by everyone. This veteran of journalism, who was once the Assistant Secretary of State and also the Director of the Washington Headquarters of the United States Information Service, spoke very gently, appropriately, and powerfully. He initially said a long passage about the United States' promotion, growth, and contribution to the new freedom, and then talked about the basic concepts of the American people regarding freedom of the press. He said: The American people revere rationality, and the American people believe that freedom of the press is one of the moral standards of the United States. As sacred journalists, they have unwavering moral confidence. In World War II, the United States exerted this highest moral force, defeating fascism like sweeping away fallen leaves. "However, what we regret most today is that there are still [blank space] strong [blank space] people in the world who have the ability to destroy freedom of the press activists." He also said: This conference does not allow [blank space] them to be too [blank space] [blank space], but in any case, [blank space] there is no [blank space] bill, we came to Geneva, our efforts are not in vain. We want to gather representatives from all over the world and write those solemn words of freedom of the press in black and white on the classics of our humanity. This effort is by no means fruitless. Then he concluded:</p>
<p>Oppose Violence and Despotism, Promote Freedom of the Press</p>
<p>A few days ago, US President Truman, in a speech to Congress, said a few very painful words: "The freedom of the Czech Republic has died, and the freedom of the press of the Czech Republic has also died!" How many countries today sacrifice the freedom of their citizens under violence and despotism! Let us all be uplifted, we must promote the power of freedom of the press, so that this truth becomes a symbol of national independence, world peace, and human dignity.</p>
<p>A warm hall [blank space] repaid William Benton. When his speech was in progress, the whole place was silent. The delegations of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China were all present. The Soviet delegation [blank space] whispered, showing great tension. Many small countries were indifferent, and even the zero seats of many countries were all [blank space] empty. I once inspected the entire representative [blank space], a total of [blank space] ninety-two people.</p>
<p>Even more [blank space]'s [blank space] target was Poland's speech on a noon afternoon. General Grotowski, the chief representative of Poland, an "old friend" whom I met in Warsaw last year, Grotowski is the director of the Polish News Bureau, he was in the past, and he is still now. General Grotowski is a remarkable talent in the Communist government of Poland, and indeed the only talent. Not only are his English, Russian, and French fluent and amazing, but also his thinking is meticulous and his speech is smooth. This time, he is the chief representative of Poland at the news conference. He stood up and spoke in English, speaking very slowly, one word at a time, hitting the hearts of the audience.</p>
<p>Grotowski's Viewpoint: Please Do Not Scold Poland</p>
<p>He said: The Polish government and people have always adhered to the principles of freedom of the press and accurate reporting, because freedom of the press can promote international cooperation and eliminate mutual misunderstandings. Since Poland was liberated from the iron road of Nazi fascism in 1944, it has only been more than three years. Poland now has 735 publications, including newspapers, bi-monthly magazines, and periodicals. The Polish government allows [blank space] paper publication for any religious belief, because it respects [blank space] freedom, but unfortunately, foreign journalists come to Poland, and the reports they [blank space] write greatly hinder the national interests of Poland.</p>
<p>Grotowski [blank space] [blank space] to the extreme, he said: From March 1946 to March 1948, in the two years, a total of 400 foreign journalists came to Poland, of which 250 were American journalists. They enjoy all the conveniences, preferential treatment, and freedom in Poland. They can watch to their heart's content, ask to their heart's content. At foreign journalists' receptions, they are like the most shrewd judges, asking all the doubts they want to ask. The Polish government respects their freedom of the press, and has done its best, but what they write and record is full of scolding Poland. In their eyes, they never put Poland, with 25 million people, in their eyes.</p>
<p>Respect the Interests of All Countries and Promote International Unity</p>
<p>After listing examples, he said: The Polish government absolutely adheres to freedom of the press, but has the need to accept harsh historical lessons. The Polish government for this time news freedom meeting missing, advocates discussing the following points. (1) Freedom of the press should respect the national interests of all countries with each other. (2) Eliminate insults, instigations, and war profiteering. (3) To end the progressive lives of all mankind, eliminate reactionary news reports. (4) Establish a permanent institution in the United Nations to supervise and manage the above-mentioned transgressions. Grotowski's final conclusion is: Freedom of the press is not to promote the division of the world, but to create international unity.</p>
<p>He sat down amid much applause. After listening to Grotowski's speech, I walked to the Eden Hotel. I told Mr. Ma Xingye about the content of Grotowski's speech. Teacher Ma patted his thigh and said, "Well said, well said!"</p>
<p>If we put aside the international political position and stand in the position of a purely neutral journalist, watching the telegrams, communications, or photos sent back to the United States by American journalists in China every day in New York, I infinitely [blank space] love [blank space] Grotowski's anger [blank space], the anger [blank space] of a pure journalist!</p>

<h3>Anglo-Soviet Aircraft Collision Incident: Soviet Union Expresses Apology to Britain; Anglo-American Armed Escort Order Rescinded</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today that a swift investigation would be conducted regarding the incident where a British transport plane was shot down by a Soviet fighter jet over Berlin, resulting in the deaths of fifteen people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 5th] British military headquarters announced tonight that the Soviet Union had responded to British protests over the Soviet fighter jet colliding with the British transport plane. The British side deemed the response satisfactory and rescinded the order to dispatch fighter jets for protection. The United States followed suit, and on the 6th, aircraft from both countries entered and exited Berlin without fighter jet escorts.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] The Soviet Union has formally apologized for the collision between Soviet and British aircraft over Berlin. Initially, Britain and the United States indicated their intention to deploy fighter jets to protect transport planes flying in German airspace. Britain had also formally protested to the Soviet Union regarding the plane collision. A communique issued today by the Soviet military government stated, "The Soviet military government, with deep regret, announces the unfortunate news of a British passenger plane en route from Hamburg to Berlin colliding with a Soviet fighter jet preparing to land at the Soviet-controlled Dallov airfield. Both planes were completely destroyed, and all personnel on board perished." The Dallov airfield is near the edge of the British sector in Berlin, approximately five miles from the British Gatow airfield. The British plane carried ten passengers and four crew members, all of whom perished. The Soviet fighter pilot also died. Following the collision, both planes immediately caught fire and crashed. The U.S. military government announced that all its planes would be grounded on the 5th, and starting on the 6th, unless the British authorities had obtained a satisfactory explanation from the Soviet side, all planes would be escorted by fighter jets. According to eyewitnesses, as the British plane was turning left to land at the Gatow airfield, the Soviet fighter jet suddenly dove towards the British plane, leading to the collision.</p>

<h3>News Conference Passes Resolution on Freedom of Thought and Expression; Chinese Amendment to Principles of Freedom of the Press Passed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 5th] The International Conference on Freedom of the Press recently passed, by a vote of 30 to 5, a U.S.-proposed resolution guaranteeing freedom of thought and expression. A Soviet amendment calling for sanctions against defeated nations was rejected. The overall passage of the U.S. resolution is the first major achievement of this session. The resolution guarantees the broadest participation in news sources.</p>
<p>The assembly also passed an Indian resolution encouraging the establishment of one or more non-official journalists' organizations in each country. A French proposal to issue international press cards will be discussed after considering whether to establish an international press commission to issue such credentials.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 5th] The First Committee of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press continued its discussion this afternoon of the Indian amendment to Article 7 of the U.S. draft resolution on principles of freedom of the press. The chief delegate from China, Chang Peng-chun, regarding the phrase "to prevent the continued dissemination of false or distorted reports that are likely to increase hatred or promote prejudice against nations, individuals, or groups of different races, languages, religions, or philosophical beliefs," believed that the dissemination of false or distorted reports itself was already undesirable and deliberately deleted the word "continued." Zhang's amendment was ultimately passed. Furthermore, Radio Geneva tonight praised the proposals submitted by the Chinese delegation to the First Committee regarding improving the quality of journalism during its broadcast of the assembly's opening.</p>
<h3>U.S. Strengthens Arctic Defenses: Strategic Base Built in Aleutian Islands; Naval Fleet to Visit Norway at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] U.S. military authorities announced that they would set aside large areas of public land for military use in the Aleutian Islands. Authorities only stated that this was a routine matter. However, these islands are closest to the Soviet Union, and their role in World War II proved their strategic importance. The Japanese military used them to attack the U.S. mainland, and the U.S. military used the base to launch retaliatory attacks on the Kuril Islands of Japan. The Kuril Islands have now been incorporated into the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force will designate a series of islands in the Aleutian Islands solely for military use, directly strengthening defenses in the Arctic region. Additionally, the Navy Department announced that the U.S. Mobile Fleet will visit Bergen, Norway, from April 29th to May 2nd for a goodwill visit. While officials state that both events are routine, they each have a context. Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated two weeks ago that the garrison in Alaska consisted of only 7,000 troops and fewer than 100 fighter jets, and that plans were underway to increase troop strength to 15,000, with further expansion to follow. President Truman publicly expressed concern over developments in Scandinavia. Ten days later, a Soviet official newspaper launched an attack on Norway, which diplomats here believe to be a signal of renewed pressure. It is recalled that a year ago, Moscow Radio announced that Norway had agreed to cede military bases on Spitsbergen Island to the United States, which Norway denied. Spitsbergen Island occupies a strategic position on the shortest air route from the U.S. across the Arctic to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union. It is governed by Norway under a 1920 international treaty abolishing military installations. The U.S. State Department stated last year that the U.S. should be consulted if the status of the island were to change. The U.S. fleet's visit to Norwegian ports will indirectly strengthen its ability to maintain control over strategic islands in the Arctic.</p>
<h3>Japan Determined to Stop Strikes to Secure U.S. Aid</h3>
<p>Ashida Delivers Important Speech</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida stated in his address to the Governors' Conference on the 6th that the recent suspension of discussions in the U.S. Congress regarding the $180 million aid package for Japan's reconstruction due to the strikes by Japanese civil servants is a fact that we cannot ignore. It is only natural that the government take appropriate measures to prevent illegal strikes.</p>
<h3>United Nations Atomic Energy Commission Rejects Soviet Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission's working group rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for world atomic control today by a vote of nine to two. The proposal was deemed impractical and unworkable. This decision has put the United Nations' two-year effort to find an agreement between the East and West to establish a structure to prevent atomic war on indefinite hold. The Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against the proposal. The majority of nations, led by the United States, as well as China, Britain, France, and Canada, stood together. The commission is scheduled to hold a plenary session again in the second half of the month. The work of the control and operational groups has reached a standstill. The future situation will be determined by the committee or even the UN General Assembly this fall.</p>
<h3>Riots in Alexandria Worsen; Authorities Announce Curfew</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Alexandria, 6th] The riots in Alexandria entered their second day. Gunfire on the main streets leading to Mohammed Square was even more intense than on the 5th. Looting and arson continued to occur. More than a dozen fires broke out throughout the city last night. A curfew was announced, and up to 5,000 troops were deployed to maintain order. Premier Nokrashy ordered citizens not to go out after 7:00 PM on the 5th and 6th, and that anyone found on the streets after 7:00 PM would be shot on sight. Nokrashy also asked representatives of the striking police to meet with him, but the police refused.</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative Proposes Temporary Trusteeship for the Holy Land to the Security Council; Soviet Union and Ukraine Refuse to Attend Discussion</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, New York, 5th] U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Austin today outlined a proposal for a temporary trusteeship for Palestine to the other member states of the Security Council. Austin held a closed-door meeting in his Manhattan office. The Soviet and Ukrainian representatives on the Security Council did not accept Austin's invitation. The experimental approach to resolving the Palestine issue is to place the region under the United Nations Trusteeship Council, on which the Soviet Union has no representative and where no other nation wields absolute veto power. According to U.S. officials, the temporary trusteeship would not prejudice the final political agreement between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. The temporary trusteeship would end once a future government is established.</p>
<h3>General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyrighted by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance</p>
<p>Translated by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>(11) Improving Inland Military Transportation Problems</p>
<p>When General Stilwell wanted to find justification for his operations in northern Burma and a panacea for China's ills, his Chongqing headquarters completely ignored the internal transportation problems in China.</p>
<p>The internal situation in China was such that even if the Burma Road were open, it might still be ineffective. For three years, the theater headquarters had been trying to open a route to China through Burma, but had failed to pay attention to, or refused to pay attention to, internal transportation in China.</p>
<p>While the theater headquarters was focused on opening a route through Burma, it did nothing to improve internal transportation in China. It paid no attention to facilitating the distribution of the increasing supplies flown over the Hump, or to preparing for truck transport, even though truck transport was what the theater headquarters fervently hoped for.</p>
<p>In 1944, when the Japanese offensive broke into eastern China, Chinese troops could not obtain overland supplies, even though the theater headquarters wanted to provide such supplies.</p>
<p>The theater headquarters was easily satisfied with the state of internal highway transport in China, as evidenced by the fact that in 1942, highway transport barely existed. The supply department only hired one civilian staff member, Taylor, at the end of that year to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Taylor had little assistance and had to handle a task whose importance was second to none in the world. His failure was certain.</p>
<p>Some progress was made in transportation in 1943, but this was the result of efforts by people outside the theater headquarters. The China Defense Supplies and Lend-Lease representatives helped Taylor find parts for the trucks used by Chinese agencies, which did most of the hauling on China's unusable highways. Two civilian staff members of the China Defense Supplies Committee completed the first complete highway survey for Taylor, which later became a basic guide for the theater headquarters.</p>
<p>When a representative of the China Defense Supplies Committee handed over this study, the transportation director of the China-Burma-India Theater expressed appreciation, but before looking at the report, he said he wanted to know whether the internal transportation problem in China was a railway problem or a highway problem. In January 1944, the internal transportation situation in China was so appalling that I flew to New Delhi, India, where the rear echelon headquarters of the China-Burma-India Theater was located, and requested that the Air Service Command be responsible for this task. I did not want to manage this matter myself, but I did not know of any other way to get the supply department to assign personnel qualified to handle this major task.</p>
<p>As a result, Colonel Sheehan was sent to China in February. Given his lack of adequate personnel, lack of supplies, and other factors beyond his control, Sheehan can be said to have accomplished quite a bit. However, when General Stilwell was recalled in the second half of 1944, a few months before the opening of the Burma Road, a complete solution had still not been found.</p>
<p>Sheehan was a transportation expert and served as the transportation director for the China region of the supply department. He increased the volume of transport on the main transportation lines from Yunnan Province to the air bases in eastern China from about 2,500 tons per month to over 6,000 tons, despite various obstacles created by the theater headquarters.</p>
<p>From the end of 1943 onwards, Stilwell was repeatedly told that the Chinese could not have adequate transportation without material assistance. In fact, there were only two options: either airlift new trucks to China, or implement air transport east of Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>However, in mid-1944, when Stilwell acknowledged that the Fourteenth Air Force should receive supplies to resist the Japanese offensive then underway in eastern China, he handed over the responsibility for transportation to the Chinese government and refused to listen to contrary opinions.</p>
<p>The theater headquarters' failure in China was related to its assessment of the Burma Road. The theater headquarters' assessment of this major project was superficial from the beginning.</p>
<p>When the Burma Road problem was being given full consideration, transportation expert Colonel Sheehan told me that, for the reference of Roosevelt and Churchill, he estimated that the volume of transport on the Burma Road could never exceed 11,000 tons per month. He had attended the first Quebec Conference, and this figure proved to be too high.</p>
<p>However, at the Quebec Conference, an even higher official estimate for the Burma Road was produced. This was obtained by compromising between Sheehan's seemingly conservative estimate of 25,000 to 30,000 tons and another person's casual figure of 100,000 tons.</p>
<p>Stilwell did not become interested in increasing the Hump airlift until after the spring of 1943. At that time, the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington authorized my air force to prioritize the delivery of 4,700 tons of cargo per month over the Hump.</p>
<p>Later, it became clear that the Salween campaign would only be possible after the Fourteenth Air Force reached the level of carrying 4,700 tons per month. Stilwell's attitude toward the Hump airlift had changed slightly.</p>
<p>But I will postpone the story of the execution of the Salween campaign plan and narrate it in the next chapter. This is a regrettable story that has not yet been told.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing Index; Expanding Rationing: Various Industries Agree to Mutually Ration Products; Subcommittee Established to Study Technical Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Research Committee on the Compilation of the Cost of Living Index, convened by the Social Affairs Bureau, was held in the bureau's conference room yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China National Products Manufacturers Association, and various industry associations, including the underwear knitting industry, the flavoring powder industry, the soap industry in the Fourth District, the handmade cotton weaving industry, the textile industry in the Sixth District, the towel and blanket industry, the cigarette and candle industry, the firewood industry, and the soy sauce industry, attended. Gu Bingyuan, director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department, also attended. The meeting was chaired by Bureau Director Wu, who explained that the Shanghai Industrial Association had previously requested the government to uniformly set wages based on the cost of living index for the previous month because manufacturers could not bear the increase in the cost of living index. After considering this suggestion, the government did not implement it. Currently, several daily necessities, such as rice, kerosene, oil, and sugar, are rationed by the government. To stabilize the index, the goal is to expand the scope of rationed items. The government already bears a heavy burden, and further increasing rationing would be unsustainable. Therefore, it is hoped that the factories will cooperate to implement a rationing system, where in addition to rice, kerosene, oil, and sugar, all manufacturers can participate in the rationing of daily necessities listed in the cost of living index, and sell them to all employees at cost. The attending representatives all agreed to this principle and decided to form a subcommittee to promote the daily necessities rationing system, to hold its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 12th of this month to discuss technical issues and conduct detailed research. The elected members of the subcommittee are Gu Bingyuan, director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau; Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department; Tian Heqing from the Industrial Association; Jin Runxiang from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Ge Jichen from the paper industry; Wang Zhuyi from the cotton spinning industry in the Sixth District; Liang Songling from the soap and candle industry; Pan Shihao from the dyeing and weaving industry; Zhang Wenxue from the firewood industry; Lu Jusheng from the knitting industry; and Ni Gengnian from the underwear knitting industry, totaling eleven members.</p>
<p>Director Wu mentioned in the meeting yesterday that if factories producing machinery, cement, etc., cannot supply daily necessities, but the cost of living index is only set at one level, and all industries must adopt it, then there would be a situation where some enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations. This difficulty needs to be resolved. After the attendees exchanged opinions, it was decided to hand the matter over to the subcommittee for discussion. According to Director Wu, the government is currently promoting rationing policies on one hand and expanding the cooperative system on the other to stabilize the index, both complementing and supporting each other. This matter is for the local government and does not require instructions from the central government.</p>
<h3>Federation of Trade Unions Expresses Attitude: Rationing Must Be Universal and Comprehensive</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Regarding the issue of stabilizing the cost of living index and expanding the daily necessities rationing system, a spokesperson for the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions expressed their attitude yesterday, stating that the Federation of Trade Unions greatly hopes to stabilize prices, as the cost of living index is based on prices, and if prices are stable, the index will naturally stabilize. The Federation of Trade Unions greatly welcomes the expansion of daily necessities rationing, but the rationing must be universal and comprehensive. All industrial workers and professional workers in the city who are paid according to the cost of living index should have the right to rationing, and there should be no partiality or neglect. If the rationing of daily necessities only reaches a portion of industrial workers or professional workers, and the cost of living index has been lowered due to the impact of rationing prices, then those who have not received rationed items will inevitably suffer losses, and this can easily cause disputes. Therefore, the Federation of Trade Unions hopes that the authorities will carefully consider this matter. Furthermore, the Federation of Trade Unions convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors today to discuss preparations for the May Day Labor Day celebrations.</p>

According to Wu himself, when speaking to reporters yesterday, he has recently been suffering from a cough and has been advised by his doctor to quit smoking, otherwise, he risks developing asthma and suffering adverse consequences. As such, he resolved to quit smoking starting last week. Reportedly, he felt empty, lonely, and extremely pained at the beginning, but after a week, he has grown accustomed to it.

<h3>Conspiracy to Sabotage Power Plant: Iron Filings Found in Generator; Detailed Investigation Yields Clues</h3>
<p>[Shanghai News Agency Report] At the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Electricity Company, a large quantity of iron filings and broken porcelain pieces were discovered inside the No. 3 horsepower engine in the workshop at midnight on the 1st of this month, causing the internal machinery to overheat, resulting in a serious situation. The No. 1 engine was immediately switched on to continue generating electricity, but the same situation recurred. Investigation revealed that the iron filings were remnants from the plant's lathe. It is suspected that a villain placed the iron filings and other debris under the oil filler cap, allowing them to flow into the axle with the oil, with the intention of sabotaging power generation. On that day, the workshop staff included British engineer Thorne and assistants Sun Zucheng and Chen Jiahua on the middle shift (3 PM to 10 PM), and American Jewish engineer Kobert and assistants Qu Jiongming and Wang Feiyun on the night shift (10 PM to 8 AM the next morning). A thorough investigation has been conducted by the plant, yielding initial clues and a highly advantageous piece of material evidence. The case has been jointly studied with the police局, and personnel have been dispatched to closely protect the generators.</p>

In addition to those arrested, over two hundred are still at large, and the Police Bureau will continue its search. The documents regarding the Communist Party's plot for insurrection, obtained by the Police Bureau, will be publicly released once they have been fully organized.

<h3>Family Tragedy in a Property Grab: Pregnant Woman Beaten to Death in Chuansha, Pudong</h3>
<p>Ding Zhenlin (25 years old), the wife of Zhang Shuntao (a mute) from Zhangshuntao's family in Wu Jia Nong, Heqing North, Chuansha, Pudong, had been raised in the Zhang family as a child bride since she was young. Her mother-in-law, Zhang Jinshi, was known for her domineering and cruel treatment. The second son, Zhang Kuntao, and son-in-law, Gu Quansheng, conspired to seize the mute's property. Seeing that Ding Zhenlin was an obstacle, they plotted to harm her. On the morning of the 29th of last month, at 10 AM, Zhang Jinshi beat Ding Zhenlin in the fields over a trivial matter. Zhang Kuntao and Gu Quansheng seized the opportunity to join in the assault. Ding Zhenlin, who was pregnant, could not withstand the beating and fainted on the spot. Gu Quansheng and others dragged her back home, claiming she was feigning death. They kicked her abdomen repeatedly with their leather shoes and inserted a wooden cudgel into her lower body, causing her labia minora to protrude, resulting in excessive bleeding and death. Seeing the tragedy that had unfolded, Zhang Jinshi immediately used a rope to hang Ding Zhenlin from a beam, falsely claiming the next morning that she had committed suicide. The truth was uncovered by Gu Chengxiang, the village chief of Qingxiang Township, who detained Zhang Jinshi and sent her to the judicial authorities for investigation.

Ruan had purchased Dasheng shares, Yao had handled the sales, and the other stockbrokers were all related to the case. However, due to the passage of time and multiple transfers of ownership, they could not recall details. As a result, they were all dismissed. The District Prosecutor's Office also sent letters to relevant authorities to investigate. The Bankers Association replied that they had purchased Dasheng shares, but due to the long period that has passed, it is difficult to examine the archives.

<h3>Arrest Made in Draft-Dodging Scheme: Job-Seeking Youths Fall Prey; Four Suspects Arrested After Reporting to Police</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the North Station Branch of the HaiNing Road Police uncovered a case involving the sale of conscripted soldiers, and four principal offenders were apprehended. The main offender, Liu Beixiang, a native of Wuxi, residing at No. 44, Lane 510, Anqing Road, claimed to have found a job for Hu Wenbiao (18 years old), the son of his neighbor Hu Shaozu at No. 61 in the same lane, on the 11th of last month, and lured him out.

It was not until the 5th of this month that Hu's father received a letter from his son, informing him of the truth and stating that he had already been deployed to Shanghai with his unit and was serving in the 8th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Zhejiang North Garrison District at the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road.

<h3>Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Returns to Shanghai to Talk: City-wide Grain Rationing to Be Implemented Long-Term; Still Dependent on American Rice, Which Needs to Be Ordered from Abroad</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, returned to Shanghai the night before last after official business in Nanjing. Yesterday, he met with reporters and answered questions on various issues, including grain rationing: (1) The plan for the Civil Food Allocation Committee to purchase arriving food grains has been jointly submitted by him and the director of the Allocation Committee to Mayor Wu. (2) The city-wide grain rationing, originally scheduled to be implemented for four months starting in March, has been decided to be continued long-term after discussions with Minister Yu of the Grain Department in Nanjing. The source of grain still relies on American rice, which needs to be ordered in large quantities from abroad. (3) The supplementary issuance of grain to workers for February is not being discussed at this time due to the issue of whether there is sufficient grain available.</p>
<p>City Government Decides on Purchase Policy</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To balance the supply and demand of food grains and to maintain the livelihood of farmers without affecting production, the municipal government has decided to implement a purchase policy. Yesterday, Mayor Wu stated to reporters: The food grain purchase policy was drafted by the Civil Food Allocation Committee in the middle of last week and will be used in conjunction with the price fluctuations in the grain market in the future. When the supply of food grains exceeds demand, the price of grain will inevitably fall, and farmers' income from selling grain will not be enough to maintain their livelihoods, which will inevitably lead to an economic recession in rural areas, the consequences of which are unimaginable. To achieve a balance between supply and demand, the government plans to make timely purchases. If the grain market experiences price fluctuations and high prices, it will implement sales. It is firmly believed that the above policy can achieve the practical effect of stabilizing grain prices.</p>
<p>Reasons for Adjusting Grain Rationing Prices</p>
<p>When reporters inquired about the reasons for the increase in grain rationing prices this month, Mayor Wu stated: The United States has one principle regarding relief grain aid to China: (1) It is not purely for relief but aims to stabilize grain prices, and (2) the proceeds from the sale of grain are used for charitable relief throughout the country, and the scope of relief is not limited to the five cities with grain rationing. Furthermore, the United States and China have jointly established a ratio for the price of relief American rice, which cannot be lower than 5% of the free market price of rice. For this reason, the price of grain rationing had to be slightly adjusted. Mayor Wu also stated that if the grain rationing system had not been implemented in a timely manner, the price of grain in this city might have already exceeded the 5 million mark today. Relief American rice is currently being shipped continuously, and at a minimum, it can likely be maintained until the new grain comes on the market, so citizens do not need to panic.</p>
<p>Over Four Million Grain Ration Coupons Issued</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to an announcement by the Municipal Civil Survey Committee: In April, the committee issued 4,346,906 large-portion grain rationing coupons and 701,464 small-portion coupons, totaling 5,048,370 coupons. 281,298 coupons were returned and were verified and destroyed yesterday morning together with representatives from various agencies. The actual number of coupons issued was 4,767,072. The remaining uncollected coupons will be processed together with the already retrieved ones once they are collected. In April, 182,360 shi of American relief rice, 3,520 shi of white Xian rice, plus 103,435 shi and 7 dou and 3 sheng of rice from the remaining stocks from rice shops from March, a total of 289,215 shi and 7 dou and 3 sheng, had been distributed. As of April 4, a total of 49,011,694,325 yuan of grain sales revenue had been collected for the month (excluding the 5% profit that rice shops deduct as commission).</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Involving Gold Bars for Land Purchase: Two Women Fooled for Profit, Broker Accused of Fraud, Case Dismissed but Returned for Re-Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of real estate brokers Chen Jisheng and Chen Chunsheng, accused of fraud, was originally dismissed by the District Prosecutor's Office, but was returned by the High Prosecutor's Office yesterday for re-investigation. It originated with Xu Xuying, wife of Zhuang Lihui of China Investment Company, and Zhou Xiujuan, owner of Xingxing Candy Company, who knew Mrs. Zhu. Mrs. Zhu had four mu of land at the intersection of Lin Sen West Road and Changshu Road, two mu of which had previously been bought by Yan Qingling, owner of Guangyu Real Estate Company, leaving two mu. In March of the 35th year [1946], Chen negotiated with Xu and Zhou, saying that Yan intended to buy the remaining two mu of land at a high price to build garden houses. Xu and Zhou then negotiated with Mrs. Zhu. Mrs. Zhu asked for 80 gold bars, plus four gold bars as a middleman fee. Chen advised Xu and Zhou to invest in purchasing it first, and then resell it to Yan to make more profit, and if they lacked funds, he could help them find a way. Xu and Zhou thought this was a good idea, so they borrowed 20 gold bars from Yongda Bank to pay Mrs. Zhu as a deposit. In addition to raising some funds themselves, they also borrowed 50 gold bars from Chen, with a monthly interest rate of 12%. Under the pressure of high-interest loans, Xu and Zhou wanted to sell the land, so they entrusted Chen to negotiate with Yan. However, according to Chen, Yan was only willing to pay 70 gold bars. At this point, Xu and Zhou realized they had been deceived, losing 25 gold bars including interest. Xu and Zhou then sued Chen for fraud in court.</p>

<h3>Local and Out-of-Town Buyers Boost the Market, Cotton Yarn Market Thrives, 42-Count Blue Phoenix Re-Enters the 200 Million Yuan Mark</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Recently Received Letter from the Ministry of Food: Distribution of Grain to Public School Teachers and Staff in Beijing and Tianjin, Situation of Pay for Teaching Staff, Employees, and Police in Various Colleges and Universities has Improved Compared to the Past</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Report, 6th] Regarding the request from teaching staff, employees, and police in colleges and universities in Beijing and Tianjin for higher pay, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated: "The government has always been concerned about the lives of educators and will do everything possible to improve their lives. Pay in Beijing and Tianjin is currently at the second level, higher than in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, in the past, it was adjusted every three months, and by the end of March, there was inevitably a large gap with prices. Starting this month, it has been changed to monthly adjustments. Although this month's index has not yet been set, Beijing and Tianjin have already made advance payments based on 230,000 times the previous amount, so the situation is generally better than last month. Also, in the past, public school teachers and staff in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai were allocated eight dou of rice per month. Since January, it has been changed to a free allocation of three dou of rice per month for public school teachers and staff nationwide. Those who receive flour are changed in proportion. This is a general policy, not just for educators. A letter was received from the Ministry of Food stating that the distribution of public school grain and student grain in Beijing and Tianjin has been scheduled to begin this month and will be completed before the 15th of next month. The grain has been fully distributed and transported, so there should be no shortages.

Referrals submitted after the deadline will not be distributed. (2) The referral of overseas Chinese students is limited to high school graduates from overseas Chinese schools within the past two years. A high school diploma and academic transcript must be submitted at the time of referral.

Academic performance must be above 80 points, and conduct should be A grade. Each school may not exceed five students.

Alumni from various places, such as Ling Hongxun and Zhou Xiangxian, will come to Shanghai to participate. Zhang Gongquan, president of the Central Bank, Chen Bozhuang, director of the two-way bureau, and Xu Xueyu, manager of the China Merchants Bureau, will be invited to attend and deliver speeches. Various ball games will be held in the afternoon, and students from the university and the Drama Academy Yicai and other schools will perform entertainment and dance programs in the evening. Due to financial difficulties, the university can only allocate 5 million yuan for celebration expenses. In addition, 500 alumni will each pay 200,000 yuan as a subsidy. Principal Cheng Xiaogang smiled and told reporters yesterday: "Jiaotong University is even poorer this year than last year. Although it is the 52nd anniversary, we can only have a 'poor birthday.' However, the enthusiasm of teachers, students, and alumni for celebration has not diminished because of this."</p>

<h3>Answers to Questions About Military Service (1); Described by the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>This year's conscription in the city, as decided by the military service conference, will implement formal conscription. This method involves conscripting according to the order of the lottery numbers. All procedures must be handled in accordance with the provisions of the law.</p>
<p>The formal procedure for conscription is: (1) Background investigation (including applications for exemption from military service, deferment of conscription, and substitute service), (2) Physical examination, (3) Lottery drawing, (4) Conscription. The lottery drawing in the city was held on March 23rd, and conscription will also be carried out soon. The examination of applications for exemption from military service and substitute service has largely been completed. Some citizens were not aware of this due to the recruitment of volunteers last year. They only became anxious when they learned that the city was going to conscript by lottery number. They have sent letters asking for explanations of the relevant military service laws, as well as the procedures and processes for handling military service matters. For the sake of convenience, a general answer is given below, summarizing the inquiries from all parties.</p>
<p>1.  Background Investigation:</p>
<p>(1) Firstly, regarding the investigation, the target of the investigation is men of conscription age. According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, those who reach the age of twenty and pass the conscription physical examination in the following year are conscripted into active service. This year's conscription is based on last year's investigation. The age range investigated last year was five years, from those born in the 16th to the 12th year of the Republic. This lottery drawing is also based on last year's investigation.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai, being the largest industrial and commercial area in China, has many citizens who have migrated from various places. Most citizens have two registered residences. According to the Military Service Law, conscription is to be carried out in the place of origin. If residing in another area, service may be performed in the place of residence after reporting and approval. Many men of conscription age have two registered residences and participate in the lottery in both places. How can one person serve in two places? This error must be corrected. The solution is simple. If fulfilling military service obligations in the place of origin, please obtain a certificate of service from the township or town office in the place of origin and ask the district chief in the place of residence to cancel the registration in the investigation roster to avoid duplication.</p>
<p>(3) Conscription is about to begin, and many men of conscription age are trying to report departures in the household registration, but in reality, the men have not moved out and are still working or operating in their original location. In recent times, migration has been frequent. This cowardly behavior of evading one's obligations to the country has a significant impact on military service administration. The government has consulted with representatives from public opinion organizations and relevant agencies and has issued a notice in March to suspend resettlement during the prescribed conscription period. As for the group of men who have moved out on the household registration but are still in the area, the Ministry of National Defense has been notified by telegram to give priority to conscripting and sending them to serve in the military as unregistered men and draft evaders. According to reports, the number of unregistered men and draft evaders is very large. This group of men is suspected of obstructing military service. It is hoped that men who have missed the lottery or evaded military service will quickly report to the district chief in charge, otherwise they will be subject to punishment in the future.</p>
<p>2. Examination of applications for exemption from military service, disqualification from military service, and deferment of conscription:</p>
<p>Those who have legitimate reasons to be exempt from military service, disqualified from military service, or defer military service are examined in accordance with Articles 4, 5, 24, and 26 of the Military Service Law, and are granted exemption from military service, disqualification from military service, and deferment of conscription, respectively, depending on the circumstances. The reasons for each clause, application procedures, required documents, and examination procedures are described below:</p>
<h3>Postal Service Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>The bureau has received inquiries from (1) Mr. Mo Qingyu from Guangzhou and (2) Mr. He Quanyuan from the city. Brief answers to the points raised are given below:</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) (A) The bureau has a postal weight window to answer public inquiries about postage rates for postal weight. The window staff only check whether the postage affixed is in line with requirement, and the procedure is simple. (B) The bureau collects the mail from the window mailbox approximately every half hour, and the date stamp is changed every hour. If mail is put into the mailbox at 9:30 PM and collected at 10:00 PM, the date stamp should be 10:00 PM. (C) If the mail is delayed, please send the original envelope to the bureau for detailed investigation.</p>
<p>(2) (A) Mail to Suzhou arrives fastest on the same day, or one day later. (B) The city's mail delivery zone chart can be obtained from the bureau by written request. (C) In addition to being faster than regular mail, air express is numbered and easier to track. If it is lost due to the fault of the post office, compensation can be claimed, but not for regular mail. (D) Stamp catalogs can be obtained from the bureau's philatelic group, and they have already been sent. (E) Postage rates for mail to Hong Kong, except for airmail fees and regular mail calculated according to domestic rates, are generally calculated according to international rates.</p>
<h3>Scientific Research Results Show Women Are More Easily Startled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] China Natural Science Society News: Research institutions in the United States, using a group of brave young girls as test subjects, proved that women are more easily startled by unexpected sounds than men. However, they recover quickly, while men do not. This proves that nerve strain from work and overexertion in men is one of the main causes of stomach ulcers.</p>

<h3>"Yangzhou is Good"</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>—Continuation of Yangzhou Dreams, No. 28</p>
<p>The poems on small pleasure boats written by the late Yangzhou Senior Xin Buyun, praise the past condition of searching the West Lake in Yangzhou, and truly makes one yearn for it. I have already mentioned it in another article. Following Mr. Xin, there is also the Yangzhou Hao Hundred Tunes by Layman Xing'an. The layman's surname is Huang, given name Dingming, styled Luqi. The Jiangdu County Chronicle says that he "was skilled in writing and had a reputation in the local school." It also says that his "calligraphy was in the Northern Dynasties style, obtaining its elegance. He was able to write poetry, and most of his works were discarded at will, but the Yangzhou Hao and Four Books poems still exist." These Yangzhou Hao Hundred Tunes, the tune borrowed from "Longing for the South of the River," its writing object is much wider than the small pleasure boat poems, and everything such as Yangzhou's historical sites, customs, habits, and local products are mentioned, which can be read as a small Yangzhou gazetteer. My late maternal great-grandfather Zang Yisun wrote four quatrains of poems for the title, and the first poem said: "The book records the fleeting time like a shuttle, what is the local customs like in my hometown? The hundred tunes are cleverly written, and only then do I realize how good Yangzhou is!" The fourth poem says: "When the small pleasure boat floats in the setting sun, I once wrote poems on the lake with Xin Lang; I have failed to live up to the good weather of the lotus flowers, not as good as Huang Jiu's good lyrics." His praise of Yangzhou Hao Hundred Tunes is truly not to flatter his own preferences.</p>
<p>Everything written in Yangzhou Hao has undergone great changes after decades, but because it is written very intimately and meaningfully, it can still evoke some old dreams in me. For example, it says:</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Grand ceremonies are held to welcome spring. The bear sedan is carried by eight people to admire the colorful clothes, the ox whip moves three feet to activate the incense celebration, followed by the Mang God.</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Divine gatherings parade the City God. Women with muddy knees worship incense devoutly, charming young men and girls stick shoulder to shoulder to follow the procession, all at once benefiting the widows and orphans.</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Grand festivals parade the Dutian God. Jasmine thousands of flowers woven into fans, two parts of sheng and flute lead the swings, and the pavilions tower into the clouds.</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Water gatherings pass by in the deep night. Cinnamon oars welcome the City God, lotus lanterns are released to fill the moat, and many monks from the market perform alms giving.</p>
<p>These many activities of welcoming gods and temple fairs have almost disappeared today, but they were still very lively in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. Although I have never played the "Mang God," nor have I "stuck shoulder to shoulder to follow the procession," nor have I taken care of the "gege" or released lanterns for alms giving, I have often followed my family in and out of the crowd, dancing and laughing gleefully. At that time, there were also blind men's temple fairs, which were especially interesting.</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Temple fairs are called double blinds. White eyes are added horizontally to pity and redeem vows, red flags are held together to stumble and fall, and unexpected events must be guarded against!</p>
<p>This is what is written about this matter. It is a pity that there are not few blind people in Yangzhou now, but such temple fairs are no longer eye-opening.</p>
<p>In addition, Yangzhou Hao says:</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Flower markets tempt you to linger. Clear shade surrounds the house, protected by reed screens, and rows of dense and colorful plants are planted in tile pots, showing elegant intentions to pity the talented.</p>
<p>The number of flower markets shows that there are many people who love flowers when they are in season. Zheng Banqiao once said that Yangzhou "plants flowers for ten miles as farming," although it is an exaggeration, it is true that Yangzhou people loved flowers and plants in the past. From this, we can see the "elegance" of Yangzhou people in the past. It also says:</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Storytelling workshops break the melancholy. Talking about Fei Tuo, the aftertaste is beautiful, listening to Pi Qian, the knowledge is broad, and everyone laughs heartily.</p>
<p>"Fei Tuo" refers to "The Biography of Fei Tuo Zi," and "Pi Qian" refers to "Qingfeng Gate." This is authentic Yangzhou storytelling, and non-natives will not fully understand many of the slang terms in it. Yangzhou people are happy to listen to it, and children's eyebrows dance when they hear or talk about Fei Tuo or Pi Qian. From this, we can see the "leisure" of Yangzhou in the past. "Leisure" and "elegance" were originally the typical life of Yangzhou people in the past. Unfortunately, there are very few flower markets in Yangzhou now, and the flower affairs are declining, no longer as splendid as in the past. There are still people who tell stories about Qingfeng Gate, but there are no longer any who tell stories about Fei Tuo Zi. As far as the Yangzhou storytelling world is concerned, it is especially sad to see the passing of the old generation.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the educational situation in Yangzhou in the late Qing Dynasty, Yangzhou Hao also said, such as:</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Several levels of schools have opened. Names distinguish official and private education, courses combine Chinese and foreign to cultivate talents, and there is one class per year!</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Broad exercise fields have been opened. People jump and run like toads, and groups grab balls like lions, and from now on the nation will be strong!</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Girls' schools gather fairy ladies. Black-faced books are tucked in their arms, and yellow bags are carried in their hands, truly competing with the boys!</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Huang sees it very unpleasantly, so the words and sentences are full of satirical components. It also says:</p>
<p>Yangzhou is good! Northern and Southern operas share the stage. Famous actors perform in two groups every day, and students swarm in with half-price tickets, closing and opening again and again!</p>
<p>This is precisely the fashionable behavior of fashionable young people in the past. When I was young, I had infinite envy for such actions, but now when I read this poem by Mr. Huang, it only arouses infinite melancholy. Even if I could go back in time and relive my childhood, I am afraid I would no longer have the courage to envy, and I would let it be placed in the old dreams!</p>
<h3>Soliloquy</h3>
<p>— Guo Tian</p>
<p>In the sunless, secluded path, pacing back and forth, back and forth, the bamboo grove sobs softly; the water under the bridge sighs, the solemn wooden fish of the ancient temple, with the hope of a life, resounds in the evening clear sky, once and again...</p>
<p>The edge of the bamboo forest is connected to a desolate, yellow field. I walked from the dark bamboo path to the bright field, slowly, tapping the grass with my hand.</p>
<p>Blue sky, distant mountains, the eagle soars, circling in the high sky. I think, how free it is to have wings! To fly over mountains after mountains, to make a long march of ten thousand miles; to break through the roaring waves, to greet the dawn's rising sun... However, people, people only have the freedom of thought...</p>
<p>--Thought, is the free wings of man!</p>
<p>With the wings of man unfolded, traveling in that desolate desert, the snow-covered Northwest Plateau, the primitive wilderness, the beautiful world of the future, the magical things in the magical country....</p>
<p>In these sick days, in this ancient temple in the deep mountains, I have forgotten the dim home, the people living in the dilapidated village and the wilderness. I flap my wings of life, flying in the colorful sunshine.</p>
<h3>Reply</h3>
<p>— Tie Ming</p>
<p>Last night, she</p>
<p>Sobbed for me—</p>
<p>Said I</p>
<p>Why</p>
<p>So thin,</p>
<p>Unaware of cherishing.</p>
<p>My heart</p>
<p>Is like</p>
<p>A withered lotus in the cold wind,</p>
<p>Broken, astringent;</p>
<p>How often have I</p>
<p>Weaved</p>
<p>But I don't want to—</p>
<p>Don't want to say.</p>
<h3>Memories of Kunming</h3>
<p>— Li Puyuan</p>
<p>It was getting dark, and the several gentlemen who came with me were not at home. Although the sound of cars on the road was endless, in this corner of the small building, it was so quiet that I could hear the footsteps of the rats. I was lying on the table, writing about Jiang E'erwen and Di Jiang Fogerson.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, is there a Mr. Li at home?"</p>
<p>Turning my head sharply, it was Liu Shi!</p>
<p>It has been almost ten years! In Kunming, two frustrated people met for the first time, hit it off right away, complained together, ate things together, played together at the fishing platform, and also performed Dumas' "La Dame aux Camélias." In the winter of 1939, I was forced to leave this blessed land where it is like spring all year round, and since then, there has been no news.</p>
<p>Now, almost ten years have passed, and I never thought I would meet him in this lonely dusk.</p>
<p>He was still so energetic, still so enthusiastic, and still so eloquent. Seeing him brought back so many memories, so many flavors of Kunming—the orchards of Chenggong, the steep peaks of the West Mountain, the camellias of Huating Temple, the ice crystals of the Cuihu Hotel...</p>
<p>Memories, one after another, and finally, we talked about painting again.</p>
<p>"I now specialize in painting fish," he said.</p>
<p>"Isn't that great? I believe that with your intelligence, the fish you paint must be extraordinary." This is the truth. Among the many friends in the painting world, I have always admired his intelligence.</p>
<p>"But I'm going to be scolded to death!" The last two words were still in the Kunming accent.</p>
<p>"Why?" I stared at him.</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same old thing?" He smiled contemptuously, his little beard tilted to one side, but it immediately recovered and became very serious. "People scold me for wanting to apply Western painting to Chinese painting, making it neither Chinese nor Western! Heaven knows, painting is just painting, isn't it? Look--" As he spoke, he unfolded a five-foot-long single Xuan paper in his hand, on which was a hibiscus branch and more than ten dace fish. "These fish were painted by me. Can you say how much is Western painting and how much is Chinese painting?"</p>
<p>I turned on the light and turned from his excited face, which was slightly red, to the more than ten fish: they were expressed with transparent colors, light brushstrokes, and very skilled techniques, and finished in one go. Those fish were gathering and chattering about something in the clear water. His light, lively, and natural style, in this type of fish and in his personal style, is a natural product of himself.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with that? Didn't you express the nature and soul that you felt intuitively with great confidence? Isn't that what you were seeking?"</p>
<p>He laughed. From his smile, I saw Kunming again, and at the same time, I saw the cherry blossoms blooming outside the window.</p>
<h3>Carp</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<h3>Inscription on Liu Shi's Fish Love Picture</h3>
<p>— Ma Gongyu</p>
<p>Encounter</p>
<p>Leaning on reeds, two small fish lie in ambush, suddenly seeing a red dress, eyes bright, I am more beautiful than Qing Lang, washing gauze at the Bing Cave, but meeting you.</p>
<p>Pursuit</p>
<p>The empty pool raises a thousand ripples, knowing that you are a high scholar but have not yet been transformed, inches away from flowing water, shy to avoid face, willing to bother Qingdao to send a letter of love.</p>
<p>Traveling Together</p>
<p>Playing in pairs on the waves, this is an ordinary towel, laughing at those who shrink their necks, there are immortals, peach blossoms are thousands of feet long, love is thousands of feet deep, occupying all the scenery in the spring at the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>Achievement</p>
<p>No need to envy mandarin ducks in the Jin River, flounder float lightly and the algae are fragrant, surprised to find the royal family destroyed, how can the jianghu jiazi forget each other.</p>
<h3>Song of the Earth</h3>
<p>— Qingguo</p>
<p>Flowers</p>
<p>The earth is rich in emotions, and the earth opens into繁[繁]花朵[朵]。</p>
<p>The earth loves fighting, loves freedom, loves life……</p>
<p>And the flowers bloom red, yellow, blue……</p>
<p>Now there are red yellow and blue flowers everywhere ah</p>
<p>Young people yo throw away those two branches of black and white flowers of grief and sorrow that are inserted in your chest!</p>
<p>Because these ugly flowers will soon wither and beautiful flowers are already flourishing.</p>
<p>Forest</p>
<p>Everywhere are dense forests.</p>
<p>The earth has too many forests: the earth has green forests, red forests; the earth has dawn's forest, the sun's forest; the earth has young and robust forests; the earth has forests that love to talk and laugh……</p>
<p>When I walk into any forest I feel that they are so mysterious and magical deep and vast.</p>
<p>I feel that every tree in the forest is simply a thought that has been drawn from the earth's chest.</p>
<p>So the earth is the smartest after all!</p>
<h3>Recent World Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Romain Rolland's Autobiography</p>
<p>Recently, a "Philosophy Book" was published in New York, containing Romain Rolland's autobiography, "Journey Within." This fragment of autobiography is for those already interested in Romain Rolland, not for those who want to get to know him. In other words, this is not an introductory book of common knowledge; these fragments are impressionistic and sometimes mysterious, requiring great effort from the translator, Elsie Pell.</p>
<p>The author writes about his childhood, feeling imprisoned by that life. He talks about his own illnesses, the deep impact of his little sister's death, his belief in Spinoza's philosophy, the loss of his traditional Catholic faith, his ancestors and his relationship with his parents, his early creative attempts, his lifelong love of music, his dealings with Rome, the creation of the character Jean-Christophe, his final friendship with Malwida von Meysenburg, the impact of World War I on him, and so on.</p>
<p>Malwida was quite familiar with Wagner and Nietzsche, Mazzini and Herzen. She raised her cold but calm hand to the young Rolland, and looked at him passionately with her wise eyes. He was greatly influenced by her. He said, "Malwida's love helped me. Her wise heart makes you trust yourself. Brightness shines, giving you warmth. My spirit thus gained new strength. She is a friend who understands you, a friend who creates you."</p>
<p>This situation is similar to his observation of Rome: "She does not hide her secrets; perhaps she has no secrets. But she shows yourself to you. All who know her do not know her, but discover themselves."</p>
<p>Rolland's work "Colas Breugnon" is better than the lengthy and cumbersome "Jean-Christophe." However, even though the latter is cumbersome, terrible, and lacks stylistic elegance, each part of this monumental work, as well as the sum of all parts, approached with the greatest patience, is truly great. Apart from this book, the author had no such creative power, nor such painful post-war experiences. At that time, Barrès and Thomas Mann were both against him. Barrès spat out his resentment. Thomas Mann opposed civilization based on German culture, even saying: "Humanity degenerates through peace. 'Lazy rest' is the tomb of 'courage.' Law is the friend of the weak, the purpose of law is to balance the world, war is strength.'"</p>
<p>Romain Rolland's strength is heroic, and the pressure he endured was particularly great. "Jean-Christophe" will ensure his eternal existence.</p>
<p>Two Novels by Mauriac</p>
<p>Two recent novels by the great French novelist François Mauriac (1885—) have been translated into English: one called "Thérèse" and the other called "Vipers' Tangle."</p>
<p>"Thérèse" is composed of four stories, two longer and two shorter, all writing about the same protagonist, Thérèse. They were written at different times, from about 1927 to 1933. The original French versions were published separately, but now the translator, Gerard Hopkins, has combined them.</p>
<p>The story of Thérèse can be said to be a story of crime and punishment. Mauriac studies the southwest of France, which he knows well. In the first story, it begins with Thérèse being accused of attempting to poison her husband, Bernard, and having just been acquitted by the court. She is on her way home, planning how to poison her husband.</p>
<p>In the latter two stories, she is already eleven or twelve years older than before. In the former, she is almost insane; in the latter, she seeks love from a younger man. The former is written worse, the latter is better, and the best should be the last long novel, "The End of the Night" (1935). She seeks love throughout her life, but seems to be unsuccessful. She said very early on: "I don't know what love is. It is just the goal I often desire. This goal possesses me, blinds me, makes my legs stand on wasteland, throws me against walls, forces me into the mud, and exhausts me in the mire." Now it talks about her daughter's life. Her daughter also falls in love with a young man, which is a painful test for her. This is a cruel trial, a major blow, and her body and mind collapse. Later, she spent many years in prison. Only death can free her. She waits for death, and the story ends.</p>
<p>Is this Mauriac's best novel? According to his position in the modern French literary scene, although this work is very delicate, it is not entirely flawless. The first part makes the reader interested in the heroine and is touching. The last part is not very satisfying. The overall structure lacks a sense of harmony.</p>
<p>"Vipers' Tangle" was published in France in 1933 and is the story of a madman, mostly written in diary form. The title is particularly symbolic; the knotted vipers symbolize the family's mutual jealousy and the protagonist's complex emotions. Like Dostoevsky, Mauriac's characters are complex, ambiguous, and illogical. In 1939, Jean-Paul Sartre, still unknown, attacked him for writing characters who were merely passive puppets in a chess game. More recently, he has been attacked by anti-Manicheans, saying that he is a spokesman for conservative diners.</p>
<p>As a novelist, he was influenced by Dostoevsky; as a poet, he was influenced by Baudelaire. He is worthy of being one of the greatest writers in the world, and it is fortunate that his two books have been translated into English.</p>

<h3>On "Scholars"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone in Jiang Guo called on China's intellectual class to step forward in the turbulent times, shoulder some responsibility, and play a role. This matter, on the one hand, shows the American people's concern for China, and on the other hand, reflects the American people's emphasis on the intellectual class.</p>
<p>"Intellectual class" is a new term. We originally had similar terms, called "scholars," or more popularly, "reading people." In the past, our country also valued reading scholars, but looking at the four professions of "scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants," "scholars" ranked first. The ancient saying "Scholars can be killed, but not humiliated" also gave "scholars" a particularly lofty position, as if to say that people belonging to other classes can be insulted, and that scholars, even if there is a difference, must be given special consideration and cannot be punished casually. Probably also as a result of this concept, the Qing scholars did not have to kneel down and perform great salutes when they saw officials, and officials could not casually beat the scholars' buttocks.</p>
<p>According to the author's personal opinion, such emphasis on reading scholars may overestimate the identity of scholars too much. It must be known that scholars are only one class among many classes in society, and their status should not be particularly superior to other classes. After ten years of war in our country, in fact, the status of "scholars" in society has been reversed and has undergone a great change. Those who used to respect scholars are now quite inclined to despise scholars. The reason is nothing more than that during the war, people valued livelihood the most, and the problem of eating was particularly important, while scholars were most ignorant of livelihood problems. In the process of survival competition, they inevitably performed lifelessly. In the midst of currency fluctuations, most people in society either hoarded goods or speculated, and there were quite a few people who made a fortune from the national crisis. As a result of "not engaging in production," scholars naturally became poor reading people. Greed is human nature. People witnessed the glory and wealth of those nouveau riches, returning home in brocade, and inevitably ridiculed those poor reading people as "poor and sour," and harbored the idea of looking down on them. In my humble opinion, this also lowers the status of scholars too much. Although this is a reaction against the past excessive emphasis on scholars, it is also unnecessary to overcorrect.</p>
<p>It is just that today, the scholars of our country are indeed facing a major crisis, and there is a great need to reconsider their own position. In fact, the respect of the Chinese people for reading people in the past also contained some snobbish effects, because only reading scholars could enter the court to become officials and enjoy glory and wealth. Secondly, the reading people in our country are a minority class, "rarity is valued," and scholars are regarded as privileged members of society. Therefore, today's scholars have been reduced to civilians, losing their original special status, which is also the result of the natural progress of society.</p>
<p>In this era of great upheaval, society is evolving forward. Although we cannot predict in which direction the evolution is taking, one thing is certain: the era of only eating and not working, only knowing how to enjoy and not knowing how to fulfill one's due obligations, will eventually disappear. And the so-called scholar class in our country, generally speaking, is a leisure class that enjoys more than it works. The highest ideal of social evolution is "each according to his ability, each according to his needs." We ask the scholars of our country, apart from a few learned scholars who can still write some impractical books and establish some empty theories, what "virtue" do they have, what "ability" do they have? Monks chant scriptures and meditate, knowing that they are only consumers in society, so they eat vegetarian food, wear simple clothes, and strive for simplicity in everything. However, the majority of the ten people in our country, although not really "unable to restrain a chicken," their contribution to society is equal to that of monks who have become monks, and the enjoyment they demand is ten or a hundred times that of monks. Its unreasonableness is obvious. This is something that our scholar class should reflect on.</p>
<p>Of course, the ancients had a set of moving explanations for the role of scholars in society, saying that scholars, on the one hand, enjoy the food, clothing, and shelter provided by the people, and at the same time, they are busy eliminating harm for the people, so that the people can live and work in peace, and do not have to worry about political affairs anymore; according to this, the relationship between scholars and other classes is a relationship of division of labor and cooperation. Although this theory makes sense in theory, we must know that the reason why scholars have become a class of their own is only the result of the lack of universal education. In the future, once education is universal, people will all have the opportunity to read, and people will all become scholars; what will the situation be like at that time? In the author's opinion, if future scholars do not seek other developments and purely take the position of scholars as a starting point, their main outlets will be no more than two: the first is to teach future generations with what they have learned, which is teaching, which was called sitting in a hall in the past; the second is "learning to be excellent then serving as an official," which is becoming an official. But in fact, where would there be so many vacancies for teaching or becoming officials?</p>
<p>Therefore, today, scholars must seek other ways out. Relying solely on the empty name of scholars, there will be absolutely no hope of development in future society, because the scholar class will inevitably be eliminated in the future. In an ideal society, farmers, artisans, merchants, scholars, and soldiers will all be scholars. Therefore, scholars must simultaneously be farmers, artisans, merchants, scholars, or soldiers in order not to become parasites in society.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Businessmen</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, Portuguese individuals sailed in fleets of large sailing ships and round ships to Lisbon every year, fully loaded with wool fabrics, fine glass products, clocks produced in England and the Netherlands, and wine produced in Portugal; then they visited various seaports to exchange for various goods.</p>
<p>The ships sailed from Goa to the Aegean Sea, exchanging for spices and gems; from the Aegean Sea to Malacca, exchanging for spices and sandalwood; then sailed to Macau, China, exchanging for silk fabrics; then turned to Japan, exchanging for gold and silver ingots; then returned to Macau, and then fully loaded with gold, silver, musk, pearls, ivory products, fine woodwork, lacquer porcelain, and silk fabrics, and returned to Europe.</p>
<h3>Price Increase is Good</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Tomorrow is April 1st, and I heard that the price of photography is going to increase. I told this shocking news at home, and immediately gathered 300,000 yuan, and rushed to the photo studio that night to wash half a dozen photos each for myself and my two sisters. This matter is indeed "people are of one mind." The photo studio was booming and lively.</p>
<p>Having done this thing tonight, let him increase the price tomorrow. What does it have to do with me? On the way home, I felt a kind of "cheap" comfort in my heart.</p>
<p>Thinking carefully, isn't that how we usually react to fluctuations in any commodity price? Whenever we hear news that a certain commodity is going to increase in price, we always buy desperately, for fear of being behind others. As a result, this commodity is immediately sold out, and those who are left out consider themselves unlucky.</p>
<p>Think about it, what kind of advertising in the world can compare with the words "price increase"? As long as you shout the preliminary command of "price increase" or make a preliminary gesture of "price increase," you are guaranteed that your goods will be sold out quickly and the banknotes will pile up like mountains. Not only can you save a lot of advertising fees in a passive way, but also, in an active way, its effect of attracting customers is ten thousand times better than ordinary paid advertising. From the perspective of the boss, of course, "price increase is good." And on the customer side? Buying goods before the price increase is considered to have taken advantage. If the price does not increase, they feel that they have not taken advantage. Therefore, from the perspective of the buyer, they also feel that "price increase is good." As for those who "slowly follow and climb later" and are left out? It doesn't matter. Let's buy the goods that have increased in price for the time being. Soon, the price of the goods will increase again, then the goods that you bought at the increased price before will be cheap again at this time. At this time, wouldn't you feel a kind of "taking advantage" pleasure! In this way, price increases are always good.</p>
<p>Conversely, what about price drops? It goes without saying that the store owner suffers a loss, but the buyer is not necessarily comfortable. Why is the buyer uncomfortable? I can also give an example of a personal experience to illustrate: Yesterday, the school began to reissue the public sale of rice for February to each student, 2.3 dou. Many publicly funded students sold this 2.3 dou of rice because they are now boarding at the school. I also bought one share, priced at 575,000 yuan, equivalent to 2.5 million yuan per stone. I was triumphant, feeling that I had taken advantage. Who knew that the students who sold it today all sold it for 500,000 yuan per share, which was a price drop compared to yesterday. I felt that I had suffered a loss yesterday, and I was indeed a little uncomfortable. If they sold it for 600,000 yuan today, then I would definitely be happy that I had bought a cheap product. This matter can also indirectly prove that "price increase is good."</p>
<p>Since price increases are so good, why not increase them?</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Language</h3>
<p>— Shuang</p>
<p>American diplomacy only emphasizes the brain and not the feet. — C.G. Dawes, author of the Dawes Plan —</p>
<p>Frank and clear — the art of deceiving and confusing people lies in this. — British Prime Minister B. Disraeli</p>
<p>There are three kinds of animals in the world. When they seem to be coming, they are actually gone, and when they seem to be going, they are actually coming. One is a diplomat, one is a woman, and one is a crab. — Hai John, the originator of the open door policy</p>
<p>An ambassador is an honest man sent to a foreign country to lie specifically for the benefit of his country. — Sir H. Wotton</p>
<p>I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I just have to tell the truth and they will never believe me. — C. Carnot</p>
<p>When a diplomat says "yes," he means "maybe," when he says "maybe," he means "no," and a person who says "no" is definitely not a diplomat.</p>
<p>The most important thing is: (1) do not set up non-luxurious banquets, (2) pay more attention to women. — Napoleon's instructions when he appointed Archbishop Mien as the ambassador to England</p>
<p>Diplomats are fortunate to have long noses, because their vision often cannot extend beyond their noses. — Former French Ambassador to the United States P. Claudel</p>
<h3>From Ideal to Practice</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Almost every major invention has been hindered by people with conservative ideas. Six months after the Wright brothers first flew a plane, a famous American scientist shamelessly said that flying was impossible. When Edison's first electric light was tested, the president of the "Stevens Institute of Technology" poured cold water on it, saying that the test was a "failure." … When Germany built the first railway, doctors solemnly said: The train's fast speed of fifteen miles per hour would cause the passengers' blood to gush out of their eyes, mouths, and ears.</p>
<p>This opposition to change is often insisted upon by those who believe that change will cost them money. Capital and labor are equally opposed to new machines and new methods. The owners of British carriage firms used ridiculous laws to exclude the first steam cars. In Florence, Italy, when some merchants first adopted Arabic numerals to record payments, other merchants believed that this time-saving counting method was greatly detrimental to themselves. They did not think of abandoning the inconvenient Roman numerals to learn Arabic numerals, but in 1299, they enacted laws to prohibit the use of Arabic numerals.</p>
<p>There must be a long period of time between the emergence of a new idea and its widespread use. Someone analyzed the results of nineteen major inventions between 1888 and 1913, and the average was: 176 years from the generation of the idea to the creation of a concrete model. The first actual application was another 24 years behind. It took another 174 years for it to truly become a commodity, and it took another 12 years for it to become a necessity in society.</p>
<p>This long period of time is caused by the majority of people in society. Human beings have long developed inertia, which not only hinders their own feet, but also hinders the few prophets and pioneers.</p>
<h3>Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Weather — the only material for some people's conversations. As the saying goes, "relying on the sky for food" and "leaving it to fate," who says otherwise?</p>
<p>If sunflowers are pro-Japanese, then goosefoot, maple trees, and monthly red roses must be red party members without a doubt. Does the weeping willow not know "left-leaning," or is the willow "right-leaning"? Still needs to be confirmed. Peony is the king of flowers, and the imperialist is the host. Orchid has the fragrance of a king, and it is obviously a remnant of feudalism that still exists. — "If people can understand words, there will be a lot of things to do." The flowers are sighing.</p>
<p>The cicadas on the branches, regardless of everything, shout "I know, I know" all day long. Obviously they don't know, but they still desperately "know." — singing a high tune.</p>
<p>The proud rabbit took a nap during the race, and as a result, the tortoise won.</p>
<p>In fact, if it had woken up earlier, it might have been in time. — No, it would definitely have been in time.</p>
<p>When the flower withers, the fragrance is gone; when a person dies, his fragrance is still there, and forever. — if he really has fragrance.</p>
<p>The peach blossoms outside the curtain are particularly beautiful, and it is also particularly cute to look at people from a distance.</p>
<h3>Xiaoyao Hua</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Xiaoyao at Sea (210)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai knew that Feng Sheng had never had any opinions and must have listened to Han Yu's words, so she could be so resolute. The result of coming today can be said to be still zero. Yun Qing believes that her letter has power, but it is still ineffective. I might as well go to Yun Qing's house again and tell her what happened, and ask her to think of a way. Yun Qing is a warm-hearted but cold-faced person. If I ask her repeatedly, she will definitely understand me. Zhu Zhai sat silently in the chair and thought quietly for a while. He felt that there was no other way but to bother Yun Qing. Then he sighed and said, "Since you are so determined, I have nothing to say. I very much agree that Feng Sheng, you can be independent. If you need my help in the future, I will still fulfill my obligations." Feng Sheng said, "I don't need your help." Han Yu hurriedly interjected, "That's not how you should say it. You should help each other. Mr. Xu helps Feng Sheng, and Feng Sheng also helps Mr. Xu. You two, on the surface, are each going your own way, but in spirit, you are still cooperating together. I hope you two can cheer up and work hard to move forward. I wish you success." Feng Sheng and Zhu Zhai's stalemate was finally broken by Han Yu's words. Although both of them were sad in their hearts, they reluctantly showed a little smile after hearing Han Yu's words and thanked her for her kindness. Zhu Zhai took this opportunity to stand up, nodded to Han Yu and said, "Thank you for your kindness! I am very grateful to you!" Then he nodded to Feng Sheng and said, "I hope you take care of yourself. I will come to see you again before I leave Beiping, and even after I leave Beiping, I will write to you." Feng Sheng just stood there woodenly, without saying a word. I don't know if she was sad or resentful in her heart. Seeing that she had no expression, Zhu Zhai had to say goodbye and left, feeling very melancholy in his heart. He felt that Feng Sheng was usually a person with no opinions and was very easy to be moved by her enthusiasm and change her views. He did not expect that she would know this Miss Han and have her give her ideas. Now that she has been caught by Han Yu, it is impossible to change her psychology again. I will tell Yun Qing about this situation and see if she has any good ideas. If she is at a loss, I will trouble her again. In the end, she cannot refuse me. She has deep feelings for me and cannot ignore me. After Zhu Zhai decided on his idea, he hired a rickshaw and rushed straight to Yun Qing's house.</p>
<h3>Celebrating Grandfather Sa (Part 1)</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Old General Sa's benevolent and amiable image, resembling the compassionate appearance of Guanyin of the South Sea (see page 2 of the March 21st Shen Bao), meets us again. He has been almost forgotten by the world, but he is truly an old man most worthy of being remembered. He is a military man, yet more gentle and refined than scholars; he is a noble official, yet more simple and unpretentious than commoners. Everything about him is unique!</p>
<p>The old man is celebrating his ninetieth birthday this year. "Few live to seventy since ancient times," seventy is already a "rare age," let alone eighty? Let alone ninety? Truly rare indeed. Speaking of senior officials in the political arena that can be pointed to at present, there is Chen Kuilong, the former Governor-General of Zhili under the Qing dynasty, residing in Shanghai, who is ninety-two years old this year. This one representing the civil and the other representing the military can be considered two elder stars, both high-ranking officials of the first rank during the Qing dynasty. (After the victory, Mr. Chen even sent a telegram to intercede for his former master, the Pu Emperor; this person seems to be still alive.)</p>
<p>The old man is a general, a veteran commander, who commanded great power in his time, holding the fate of the three armies. But he never grew a beard in his life. Therefore, when President Xu Shichang appointed old Sa as acting Prime Minister, there was a doggerel in the newspaper saying, "Old and yet ascends the stage, Sa Zhenbing," meaning he was like the old Lady Yang (Yu Taijun) in a play, mounting the stage to appoint generals. Even at this venerable age of ninety, his lips and chin are still as bare as Ox Mountain. If it were not clearly stated that it was "Sa Gong Zhenbing," people might mistake him for someone's grandmother. (At that time, there were two people famous for being "beardless" in the northern political circles, one was Sa Weng, and the other was Wang Shitong Shuheng, the father of Wang Yintai. There were also two people famous for having "big beards," one was Sun Baoqi Muhun, who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs during Yuan Shikai's time, and the Prime Minister during Cao Kun's time; and the other was Wang Dantang, "Big Beard" Wang.)</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, the old man suddenly had the grand idea of touring the north. People thought that since he had retired to his hometown for many years, he might have some lingering affection for the old capital. But, unexpectedly, he did not linger in Tianjin or Beijing, but instead made a big circle in the desolate and cold areas outside the Great Wall, in the Northwest. When the Japanese invaders were rampaging in "Manchuria and Mongolia," some suspected that he had some investigative mission, which was inconsistent with his idle status. Later, when talking with Elder Chen Youyong (also from Fujian, also a senior figure in the naval circles), it was revealed that the old man was specifically there to repair the tomb in the Zi Tai Mo area. The Sa family is a large clan in Fujian, but in the national genealogy, it is a rare surname. It is said that they were originally part of Genghis Khan's troops, and due to Kublai Khan's unification of the Central Plains, they were assigned land to garrison and assimilate in Fujian, thus becoming Han Chinese. Historically, this is not uncommon, and it is not limited to this one surname. (In the Three Kingdoms period, there was Samo Ke; in the Yuan Dynasty, there was the minister Sa Dun; both are transliterations, and the original text of the Sa surname should have been more than one character.)</p>
<p>In the past, the generals of the Northern Warlords, such as Old Duan and Old Feng, were all arrogant and hot-tempered. But old Sa was always amiable and had a kind expression. Although he was the leader of the military, he was more gentle and refined than scholars. Xu Shichang appointed him as Prime Minister because at that time, the political tides were turbulent, and those sharp-edged politicians and bureaucrats were constantly vying for power, causing almost a complete collapse. He had no choice but to ask him to temporarily maintain the situation. When others were seizing power, old Sa remained indifferent. When old Xu asked him to come forward, he did not decline or push back, saying that it was fine if it was fine, and there was nothing he could not do. All parties had no ill will or jealousy towards him, and all regarded him as a "Mr. Nice Guy" and a peacemaker. According to the old-style bureaucracy, it is not surprising to have a "Mr. Nice Guy," but in the case of a naval admiral, it must be considered special. Yang Xiaolou was a leading figure in martial arts, but his demeanor was more refined than a male lead in civil plays. People called it "performing martial arts in a civil manner," and old Sa's style was quite similar.</p>
