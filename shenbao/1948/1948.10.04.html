<h3>遠東馬歇爾計劃　美官員起草完畢　總額數十億美元以中印菲爲對象　擬自美投資家獲得援款</h3>

<h3>彌補財政赤字　節約外匯提案　立院列入明日第八次會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕立院第二會期第八次會議，定五日舉行，議程中列入報吿事項之政府提案，有政院咨請審議之修正民用航空局組織條例草案，墾殖法草案，修正復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例條文案等。討論事項中除前次會議未議及各案外，新列者計有四案：（一）法制委會報吿草擬委員資格審委會組織規程案，（二）社會委會報吿審查公務員保險法草案案，（三）黃統等提議土地國有，大　公耕，計資給息，計勞給酬，餘力作工，合作分享，工農一體，社會一家案。（四）楊保東等提議，為擬具彌補財政赤字及實行節約，减少外匯辦法，以穩定經濟，而固國本案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕立委楊保東，姚廷芳等卅一人，頃向立院提出「擬具彌補財政赤字及實行節約，减少外匯辦法，以穩定經濟，而固國本案」，業經列入議程，定五日例會中討論，該案指出：幣制改革月餘，經濟漸趨穩固，物價亦形安定，實為抗戰迄今前所未有之良好現象，唯國家財政仍有困難重重，戡亂戰事未能完成，由於（一）軍費浩大，（二）行政機構組織龐大，開支巨繁，（三）各機構習於奢侈，不惜公務，濫行耗用，因擬具彌補財政赤字及節約外匯辦法七點，（一）軍隊空額過多，影響作戰及軍風紀甚大，茲擬請政府組織軍風化考察團，立·監委參加組織，分別考察其作戰是否努力，人數是否充足，紀律是否嚴明，據實報吿，以定賞罰，並令將所有空名補足或掃數歸於國庫。（二）所有與戰亂建國無重大關係及重複可併之行政機構，應一律予以分別裁撤或合併之。（三）各機構人員應照戰前數目不得增加。（四）政府收支不符，據估計約為百分之三十至百分之四十，而政府組織疊床架屋，冗員充斥，效率减低，故應一律裁减人員百分之三十，以期收支適合。所裁減人員似以能力薄弱與有家可歸而不致資者爲宜。（五）因戰區擴大，鄉村動蕩，人才均集中於都市，以致都市人浮於事，而地方人才缺乏，政令難於推行，所有被裁人負，應分發地方機關，以期充實地方建設。（六）除食糧·棉紗等必需品外，其餘不必要之貨物及烟類。化裝品應絕對禁止進口或予以相當限制。（七）汽油一項尤為消耗國家大宗外匯，而各級官僚以及殷商富戶每出入娛樂塲所，遊玩山水及接送學生等，皆用汽車，如此消耗，數目龐大，極應取締，故規定在戡亂時間，除機關正副首長及郵務·醫務·警務·建築公司因公務業務上之需要，得用專車·交通車與人民乘坐公共汽車外，其餘全國所有之公私汽車，應一律不發執照，禁止使用。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二日電〕幣制改革後以金圓券改編之卅七年下半年度中央政府普通預算及特別預算，業經行政院擬妥，並經咨送立法院請予審議，以便照案執行。據記者向可靠方面探悉：改編金圓預算、並非按照原案所列數字折合金圓數額，由於財政經濟緊急處分令之實施，政府之收入及支出均有甚大之增加，其增收增支之比例，亦因實際情形不同，而有若干差別，收入方面依照整理財政及加强管制經濟辦法之規定，政府稅收激增，尤以國產烟酒類稅，所得稅，鹽稅，印花稅，貨物稅，關稅之增收為甚。印花稅收入新預算，較原案增收幾達十三倍，國產烟酒類稅及所得稅增收為十借左右，特別預算歲入項下之美軍剩餘物資，租借物資，敵偽產業物資及日本賠償物資出售所得，且係按美金計值，由於美金折率提高，故收入數字亦大為提高。另有出售國營事業股票一項，為原預算中所無者，現亦一併列入，就整個數字估計，政府之收入在本年下半年度內改編預算所列者，約為原預算之四倍左右。普通預算之歲入歲出，仍能保持平衡，特別預算歲入歲出之差額，約為百分之廿左右，政府當另行籌劃抵補之策，以上各項收入中，美援四億美元並未列入，故特別預算中之差額，如以善為運用美援，節省開支，以資抵補，卽屬綽有餘裕。支出方面，基於同樣理由，亦有同樣之增加，其中最大之支出，為依照整理財政及加强經濟管制辦法之規定，公敎人員及軍官佐土兵之薪餉，己大為增加，約為愿預算案之四倍，各機關辦公費以折合金圓後為數甚小，難於支應，自九月份起，亦經分別調整，一般均增加七成左右，大致為按職員人數作計算標準，每人每月為十圓左右，超過者核减，不足者核增，依此計算，約增加五倍左右，在該改編預算案中，普通預算收入最多者為貨物說，佔百分之廿九强，次為鹽稅及關稅，各佔百分之十七强，所得稅佔百分之十强，印花稅佔百分之八强，國產菸酒類稅佔百分之五强。支出最多者為國防部主管，佔百分之三十强，價務支出佔百分之十八强，財政敎育支出均佔百分之九强，糧食及司法行政支出各佔百分之五强·特別預算收入最多者為國有財產及物資售價收入，約佔百分之四十七强，價務收入（其中一部須彌補者）約佔百分之四十六强，支出最多者為國防部主管，佔百分之六十七强。糧食部主管佔百分之十一强。交通部主管佔百分之七强，改編預算較原預算案雖有甚大之變動，然由於收入劇增，支出節减，普通預算且有盈餘，特別預算之差額亦比例减少，整個預算，較原案更為接近平衡，如年內物價無大波動，此項　　預算可望照案執行，不再追加。</p>

<h3>社論　訴諸世界與論乎？</h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會從今夭起，開始處理英美法三國對柏林危機的控訴，聞蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，美國務卿馬歇爾曁英國外相貝文，均將親自出馬，參加柏林危機的「公開討論」。西方國家雖要求安全理事會對於此一巳造成「和平威脅」的柏林問題，採取有效的行動，但蘇聯卽使不退出聯合國或拒絕安全理事會處理其事，也必將行使其「否決權」，使安全理事會討論不出什麽結果來。凡稍有國際常識的人都知道英美法三國決將柏林危機訴諸安全理事會，是沒有實際效用可言的，就是在英美法三國外交當局，也明白此舉不過一種外交攻勢而巳，未必抱着過奢的期望。</p>
<p>但從另一角度去觀察，英美法三國將柏林危機訴諸聯合國，公然指責蘇聯封鎖柏林的行動，是一種違背憲章的暴行，足以威脅世界和平，在最近的三年來，聯合國安全理事會處理五强之間的糾紛，這還是第一次，格外顯示出柏林危機的嚴重性，確已到了雙方非攤牌的階段，故其意義是非常重大的。尤其是這幾天，巴黎巳成了世界政治的重心，從那裏廣播出來的新聞，似乎都充滿了火藥味使戰後未滿三年的世界，好像又到了戰爭的邊緣，自始至終參與莫斯科談判的美國駐蘇聯大使史密斯也說：「美蘇關係已至非常危急的境內。」</p>
<p>史密斯大使的這句話，決非危言聳聽，而是對雙方各趨極端的一種警吿。我們在華麗的夏樂宮中，除了聽到蘇聯代表維辛斯基的拍案大駡「戰爭販子」而外，並聽到英國外相貝文譴責蘇聯無和平誠意的呼聲，甚至公然主張區域聯盟，他說：「因為我們無法預期聯合國在世界的基礎上進行，所以我們只得在區城的基礎上進行了。」至於法國外長許曼和比利時外長史巴克，也異口同聲的為西方國家的奧援。足見各國代表情緒的緊張，對蘇採取「綏靖政策」，已經是絕不可能的事實了。再看西歐五國外長舉行緊急會議，毅然決定設立聯防總部，並推舉英國陸軍參謀總長蒙哥梅萊元帥為五國聯軍最高統帥，顯然西歐已走上準備戰爭以防萬一的道路，怎不使人心頭蒙上一層戰爭的暗影？</p>
<p>但柏林危機果將引起新的戰爭嗎？這個問題，我們只有從兩方面去觀察：以蘇聯而論，我們實有充分的理由可以相信，蘇聯決不願以柏林事件作為戰爭的起點，不過欲利用此一事件為外交的工具而已。第一，此時尙無跡象，足資證明蘇聯紅軍已準備採取非常行動，也沒有現象可以指出，蘇聯派大軍及軍需品前往西歐；而且自蘇聯前往西歐的各種交通綫，迄今尙未修復，此時作戰對蘇絕對不利。第二，蘇聯若欲進攻西歐，則必須用大批軍隊及配備，此時蘇聯對於此一條件，尙朱具備。不僅重整軍備尙未完成，而且軍火工業尙嫌不足。第三，據華府所得情報，蘇聯積極備戰，並非準備採取攻勢，而是準備採取守勢的。第四，鐵幕以內各國的情形，尙未穩定，蘇聯不論從何處進攻西歐，其後方都是不安全的。南斯拉夫的情勢固巳袋面化，就是波蘭捷克也是不可靠的。所以不論從何角度去看，天時，地利，人和，都不宜蘇聯於此時對美作戰的。</p>
<p>回首看看美國，雖也充滿了「預防戰爭」的呼聲，好戰者一致認為原子戰爭「愈早愈佳」，但主張這種行為的人總屬少數。因為第二次大戰的血跡未乾，大多數的人民都渴望和平，美國對蘇聯不再採取綏靖政策，雖為民主與共和兩黨共同一致的主張，但決不會在此際卽先發制人，向蘇聯挑戰的。所以馬歇爾國務卿主張將柏林事件訴諸安全理事會，未必眞要聯合國對蘇聯威脅和平的行動有所作為，按其實際，也不過是一種外交攻勢而已。但將此事訴諸世界與論，能否收其預期的結果，挽回世界的逆流，實為現代文明的一大攷驗。</p>

<h3>經合中國分署宣布　執行援華工作情况　米麵·棉花·工業配件·石油　核定撥款一億一千八百餘萬美元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據美經合總署中國分署三日宣布，該分署自成立迄今，在執行援助中國人民經濟的二億七千五百萬美元計劃上之工作狀况詳情如次：</p>
<p>業已運抵中國之米與麵粉，共計一〇五，〇〇〇噸。</p>
<p>業已運抵中國或已裝船之棉花，共計三〇五，〇〇〇包。</p>
<p>擬撥工業配件款項二二，二五〇，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>石油撥款二二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>以上各部共計一一八，九五〇，〇〇〇美元，包括需用外匯購辦之物資與材料，俾此項應付之外匯中國得以節省之。</p>
<p>經合分署對於物資及款項運用，至為關切，深盼能得物盡其用之效率，以期於中國人民之經濟復興與自助能有最大之貢獻，幷擬採取適當步趨以免運華之物資擱置腐銹於倉庫。</p>
<p>上述之原則，該署凝在其下列工作上一一實踐之。</p>
<p>（一）糧食：經合署迄今業已支用二千萬美元採辦米麵，此數包括本週內自曼谷運華之七千噸食米，所有全部稻米均來自暹羅，麵粉則均來自美國。</p>
<p>自本年七月一日起，上項糧食卽作補充中國政府儲糧，以維持京·滬·穗·平·津·汕六市之配售制度。截至九月廿七日止，經合署分配之米共計七一，六四五長噸，同月廿五日止，該署分配之麵粉共計一〇，一五〇長頓，其餘業已運抵中國之糧食正在分發配售中</p>
<p>經合署以配售計劃之途徑，保證遝華糧食在受配各城市中得合理分配與全體市民，同時該署幷望能在協助之各市穩定物價，經合署計劃擔任在明年四月三日前供給配售米百分之四十，其餘數量由中國糧食部擔任籌劃之</p>
<p>（二）工業配件：配件項下現已擬撥款二二，二五〇，〇〇〇美元，協助下列十四項計劃：粵漢鐵路，平津鐵路，台灣鐵路，揚子電力公司，開　煤礦，台灣糖業公司，資委會華中華南電力廠，冀北電力廠，重慶電廠，漢口電廠，台灣電力公司，北平瀋陽太原及靑島電力廠，及海關緝私工作。</p>
<p>上述各計劃，皆經經合署司徒立門氏率領之工業調查團詳細考察後選定，幷經中美兩國政府及工業專家之縝密考察始能核准，以期每一計劃，均能增進中國之經濟自足力量及中國人民之福利也。</p>
<p>該配件計劃包含數百千萬美元價值之材料，與龐大之經濟設置，其運用自需有計劃管理之制度，俾使一切皆依科學程序進行，因此在援外方案之歷史上，一獨特之制度由是產生，以保本計劃之成功</p>
<p>每一配件計劃必須在　合署之同意下，雇用一適當之工程公司，以最經濟的費用及最短之時間內負責完成計劃」。該工程公司為指定之計劃事業遞交一服務誓約書與經合署，此項誓約書並須經申請計劃之執行人副署，保證該項計劃基於充分之技術調查，幷可望在最高之效率及最低之費用條件下，產生預期之效果。</p>
<p>該誓約書須送交一由中國政府任用之顧問及監督工程公司審核，此顧問及監督工程公司對於美援會與經合署之工業建設與配件計劃聯合委員會担任顧問及監督工程之責，並將與各計劃工程師討論有關各項工程之購料方法及其他問題。</p>
<p>上述之種種程序，其旨在保證所有計劃，皆得由經騐豐富之專家認眞辦理。</p>
<p>（三）石油：經合署之計劃，旨在資助石油產品廣續不斷之進口，以供中國民生切要之需，此項產品來源如發生阻礙，則中國之工業與公用事業，皆受影響，結果足以窒息城市及其附近鄕村之經濟生活。</p>
<p>經合署在第一·二期石油撥款上業已支付二二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，此款將用以償還中央銀行在本年四月三日至十月三日間資助五三〇，〇〇〇噸石油進口所耗去之外匯。</p>
<p>上開之二二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，包括採辦下列運華之石油（單位以公噸計）：</p>
<p>航空用汽油　二三，八四二</p>
<p>汽車用汽油　四四，八六八</p>
<p>潤滑油　八，〇八一</p>
<p>機油　五九〇</p>
<p>未煉油　九八，二六一</p>
<p>火油　三三，五一四</p>
<p>燃料油　一九四，三六七</p>
<p>（四）棉花：經合署已經運華及裝船之三〇五，〇〇〇包棉花，總值五四，七〇〇，〇〇〇美元，該署與美援會經過十二星期之商討，始議妥七萬包棉花分配紗廠辦法，關係方面深以運華之棉花，務須惠及中國全體人民，而不致為任何一部份人壟斷獲利，因此美棉自運離倉庫以迄製成紗布供給最後消費者之過程上，處處均受美援會及經合署之嚴密監督。</p>
<p>棉花之分配，以在中國使用中之全部紗錠數額為準，受配之紗廠，必須在生產之方法與標準上合乎中國政府之規定，而經經合署認可者。</p>
<p>該署等經過廣泛的調查各紗廠之製造成本後，擬定一棉花易紗布之比率，據此在合理之利潤條件下，由主管機關分配足量之原棉與各紗廠，以之交換製成之紗或布，此項交換比率，隨時在嚴密審察之下，如有需要，卽可修改。</p>
<p>棉花之分配及紗布在國內外之推銷，均由紡織品聯合管理委員會處理之，經合署經常推派代表駐會，凡棉花之撥給，製成品之分配及交換比率之修訂等皆須得經合署同意行之。</p>
<p>目前之辦法，以百分五十之製成品（紗或布）作為外銷換取外匯採購原棉之用，其餘則供國內消費。</p>
<p>經合署在暫定的七千萬美元棉花計劃下，將在本年度供給中國仰賴外棉部份之半數以上，該署此項計劃於協助中國增產與經濟復興途上，洵較其他尤屬重要。</p>

<h3>安理會討論柏林事件前夕　蘇表示願重開談判　索帥解釋柏林實際未封鎖　西方分裂德國政策爲造成「危機」主因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎三日廣播：安理會於四日開會時，將討論具有爆炸性之柏林問題，屆時各國代表均將抖擻精神，面對此嚴重之試煉。同時政治委會將繼續滋潤論原子能問題，經濟委會將開始討論社經理事會之報吿，故下星期將為聯大最緊張嚴重之一週。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林二日電〕德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基二日宣稱，蘇聯政府準備依八月卅日與西方三强在莫斯科商妥之協議，績開柏林事件之談判。索氏稱，「實際之解決」全視美英法三國是否願意解決而定。索氏概述一萬餘字白皮書中蘇聯對柏林之立塲，西方權威方面認為此乃蘇聯將在星期一開會之安理會中對柏林問題作為理由之前奏曲。索氏斥責西方國家之「分裂德國」政策，乃柏林冷戰之禍首。渠特別斥責西方盟軍之幣制改革，乃「所謂柏林危機」之近因。索氏又强調構，事實上並無對鎖柏林之事但渠又再度建議以糧食煤斤供給柏林西區之居民。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林二日電〕索柯洛夫斯基元帥今晚招待蘇區各報編輯時稱：「西方盟國對柏林問題不願有一協義，彼等欲利用「柏林危機』分散世人對其分裂德國政策之注意力。」索帥繼稱：「如西方盟國不欲使柏林成為進攻社會主義與民主主義之前哨，則柏林問題早已解決。目前柏林已經成為西方盟國攻擊蘇區經濟政治生活之基地，西方盟國曾企圖瓦解柏林之幣制，並曾採取其他種種侵略措置。三月間倫敦三國會議分髮德國之決策，乃「柏林危機」眞正之原因，西方盟國決定建立分裂之西德政府，乃盟管委會決裂之直接原因，且亦為柏林四國行政機構之重大打擊。而六月間西德之單獨幣制改革，此後並企圖將西區馬克在柏林通用，乃立卽引起所謂「柏林危機」。索帥續謂：西方盟國堅持蘇聯應解除柏林與西德間之交通限制，然又不願遵守莫斯科會談之協議，卽交通之恢復應與西區馬克停止在柏材流通同時并進。索帥特別指出在九月七日四國駐德總司令會談決裂時，蘇當局建議：（一）解除一切對鐵路交通與公路交通之限制；（二）海姆斯達特與柏林間每日通車十六次，其中三次供軍用。索帥之結論稱：其實根本無有所謂「柏林之封鎖」，柏林居民可自蘇佔區獲得一切，包括冬季用煤在內，然由於西方盟國控制下之柏林市議會之反對，遂使柏林居民不能獲得東區之供應。在談話中索帥又指出九月七日四國駐德總司令談判之決裂，實由於美軍總司令克萊將軍之間執，與會者要求有四日時間草擬一聯合報吿，向各本國政府提出，而克萊則不欲有此種報吿。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕美高級軍事當局頃已草成五十年國防計劃，此項計劃乃根據一項信念，卽蘇聯將於一九五二年可造成原子彈，及在一九七七年蘇聯可完成　越大陸之原子火箭。美聯合參謀部領袖二日警吿稱，彼等相信原子時代之防衛需要，將在今後五十年中分三個階段發展之。彼等將向下屆國會要求撥款一百五十億，為一九五〇會計年度國防第一階段之經費，</p>
<p>分三階段進行</p>
<p>設三階段如下；（一）美聯合總部預料，蘇聯在一九五二年之前，不致有原子彈，在此期內美國能發展壓倒性之原子優性，但不能與蘇聯競爭陸上軍力，據估計蘇聯武裝人員超過三百萬名。（二）自一九五二年至一九七七年，此將為最嚴軍階段，屆時蘇聯與其他國家可能製造原子武器及長距離之戰略性空軍，足以轟炸美國城市。（三）自一九七七年以後，在此一階段中，聯合參謀總部預料，橫跨大陸之原子火箭，毒氣雲層，死光其他驚人武器將出現，軍事領袖相信文明在此時期中，將有被毀滅之虞。目前美參謀總部計劃之目的有二：第一，備有足够立卽動員之軍事力量，以支持美國與蘇聯談判之外交。第二，建設第二階段蘇聯擁有原子彈時之武裝都隊。</p>
<h3>張彭春演說　支持人權宣言</h3>
<p>蘇聯加以抨擊指為反動</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎二日電〕中國代表張彭春，今繼王外長演講後，再度以中文發表演講，張氏今晨於第三委會中講述中國對人權宣言草案之立塲，張氏宣稱：中國支持在現在一般形式中之人權宣言草案，但强調此項宣言，應僅為一般人之簡單文件，而非法學家之冗長文件。張氏以流暢之中國官話及學者口吻發表此一演講</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎三日電〕蘇聯三日攻擊聯合國之人權宣言，踐之為「反動及壓制奴隸」。波蘭及白俄羅斯支持蘇聯。按本屆聯大中該項宣言將付表決。</p>
<h3>近東與中東國家　組集團障礙重重</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎二日電〕接近埃土希三國代表團之人士答覆中央社記者之問題稱，聯合社報導近東與中東十二國（包括阿富汗，埃及，阿比西尼亞，希臘，伊拉克，伊朗，黎巴嫩，巴基斯坦，沙地阿拉伯，敍利亞，土耳其及葉門）正採取步聚，在聯合國範團內建立東方集團，言之殊嫌過早。又稱，建立此種集團，前途障礙尙多，</p>
<p>（一）英美乃此種集團計劃之幕後主使者，今有關十二國對英美分治聖地之政策皆表反對，且僅阿拉伯方面之激烈反對，卽為無法克服之障礙。（二）英美之急於鼓勵成立東方集團，乃欲利用集團為在中東之反蘇堡壨，在目前保護其石油利益，將來戰時則引為軍事盟友。但消息靈通之埃及人士指陳，「吾人旣不擬為英美石油利益作工具亦不欲對蘇作戰」。</p>
<h3>社會黨拒絕支持蘆田均　日內閣大勢已去　社會黨今會議將決定政府命運</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京三日電〕日政局變化，近日來已顯示急轉直下，前次三黨會議中決定之四日舉行第二次三黨會議，現巳無形取消。將代以社會黨內部出身閣僚與黨幹部之聯絡會議，現內閣中社黨出身之加　，野溝及社黨國會對策會長采窪，均堅持內閣總辭職論。社黨方面重要幹部表示，縱令下屈政權轉落於極端保守派之民主自由黨之手，亦將不顯。因產田內閣中發生栗栖事件，實無顏以對國人。據料在四日之聯絡會議中，內閣總辭職論派將獲勝利。</p>
<p>至於總辭職之時期，一般預測必在社黨舉行中執會（七日舉行）以前，目前蘆田及民主黨已處於極端困難且屬被動之地位，對於政局之轉變將無能為力矣。</p>
<p>〔又電〕日民主黨於二日在國會議事室舉行緊急幹部會議，蘆田及犬養等均出席，對於今後如何收拾政局問題交換意見。多數人仍主張將栗栖個人之犯罪行為與民主黨政府問題分開。並極力鼓勵蘆田繼續鼓起勇氣負起政府之責任。惟據傳蘆田氏態度似已表示消極，但是否因恐栗栖犯罪問題將與蘆田氏發生關聯，則尙未敢過早預測，總之最大友黨之社會黨力量，現已不願繼續支持蘆田內閣，則其大勢巳去，固係顯明之事實。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京三日電〕今日東京各報之社鐘，皆一致要求蘆田辭職。</p>

<p>〔法國新開社馬德里二日電」西班牙官方今日承認弗朗哥與美軍事委員會主席葛萊在此所作之會談，以西班牙軍事潛能力為商討之主要問題。西班牙各報皆載長文，謂美英兩國將領連蒙帥在內，均贊同西班牙加人西歐集團，美軍事專家之意，歐洲防綫須沿庇里尼斯（法西間之山脈）而設。據接近西外部之某報今晨載稱，美英陸軍參謀部現均不信任法國，以為法國永不能有抵抗侵略之偉大軍力。</p>

<h3>暹政府鎮壓政變　軍官五十人被捕</h3>
<p>內有前軍區司令兵工廠長</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社曼谷三日電〕此間暹羅政府當局今日破獲一項陰謀推翻鑾披汶政府案，約有暹邏軍界五十各要人被捕，在被捕之軍人中，有遏第一軍區之前司令長官郁興將軍，及曼谷兵工廠長薩坦坦農。在搜查期間，國防部之四週曾互相開火，惟幸未傷人。同時還國內局勢亦屬平靜，此次事件似祗限於軍界。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社曼谷三日電〕二日夜此間警察當局曾逮捕二十名犯有發動政變推翻鑾披汶政府之文武官員，此輩被捕官員之姓名極端保持秘密。據悉，其中有數人係一九四七年十一月政變時被推翻之潘諾榮內閣中之官員。此次陰謀領袖之一，係陸軍運輸隊隊長宋格萊上校，其他嫌疑犯數名業巳逃定。</p>

<h3>南共公開斥責　蘇聯對南橫施壓迫</h3>
<p>强使走不合國情路綫</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒二日電〕南共機關報今日開始刊載共產情報局與南共間互相攻訐之文件。該報稱，匈羅政府對在各該國之南斯拉夫少數人民開始壓迫，而南國政府對在南境之匈羅少數人民決不歧視。南共機關報指斥蘇聯故意低估南斯拉夫社會主義建設之成就，開解南斯拉夫革命之性質，並傳佈對南斯拉夫國家主義之指控。南共機關報，稱「實際上彼等欲壓迫南斯拉夫在其革命過程中，採取不台於南斯拉夫國情之方式，欲使南斯拉夫不向前進，而向後退一步」。該報否認狄托事件與波蘭戈繆爾卡事件間，有任何相同之點。按戈繆爾卡為波共領袖之一，亦被指為背離馬克思路綫。南共機關報之結論稱，共產情報局與南共間之糾紛，由於情報局不願瞭解南國革命之眞正性質而致然。</p>

<h3>輕幣重貨心理　亟待矯正　搶購風氣空前熾烈　綱布莊全部拉鐵門　藥材店出定單十日之後交貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自當局實行限價政策後，正式市塲交易，已趨寥落，而各另售商店，則莫不顧客盈門，戶限為穿。究其原因，不外銀根鬆濫，且過去市民藏有之美鈔及小黃魚為數驚人，經遵當局限令兌換金圓券後，由於數年來重物輕幣觀念之牢不可破，乃羣以八一九限價為空前未有之賤價，爭相購存，其中若干物品如藥品，絨綫，肉類，布疋，或以存貨短缺，或以時令需要，乃更成為黃牛黨及單帮集團爭購之目標，利之所在，趨之若驚，於是大街小巷到處可見渠等之一字長蛇陣。昨為星期，街頭益見熱鬧，熙攘往來之行人，手中莫不持有大包小裏，滿載而歸。一般綢緞棉布莊，全部緊拉鐵門，貼出「今日售完，明日請早」之字樣，絨綫店則改以皮貨應市。烟店箔莊因加稅關係，停業已有兩日，癮君子紛紛光顧美貨攤販，購吸軍用食盒內之香烟。生涯最盛者則推百貨及鞋帽兩業，店員大汗淋漓，均有應接不暇之勢。最可笑者莫如一般專售點心之館子，一過上午九時，竟連麵點亦無法供應。再如較著名之中藥舖，因今日係廢曆初一之故，所有藥酒丸丹，亦被擠購一空，若干店家竟稱不及製作，而向顧客開出定單，十日後再行交貨。此種一窩風之搶購作風，由來雖久，近則變本加厲，此固為一般市民之心理作崇，但如何能使供應平衡，俾適應空前未有之市民購買力，實有待經管當局之詳密檢討，從速設法。</p>
<h3>戡建隊舉行茶會　招待警局長區長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戡建大隊昨日下午三時半，假麗都飯店招待本市各區區長及各警察局局長，舉行茶會，聯絡感情，並交換意見。出席賓主百餘人，警察總局長兪叔平亦撥冗光臨。戡建大隊長王昇首先表示感謝各區及各局之合作，並謂戡建隊係協助各位基層政治實際負責者建設新上海，請多予指敎。繼請各局長及區長發言，除讚頌戡建隊之工作成就外，並分別提出意見若干，或認為應多注重宣傳，轉變商人心理，並增加生產，以解救近日貨荒情形，或提出工作配合問題，應求其妥善，或建議戡建大隊，應多注意根本問題，小枝節不必太傷腦筋。或覺得「戡」的工作現已頗有成績，今後應多努力於「建」的方面。兪叔平局長表示，自戡建大隊蒞滬以來，在警局方面獲得許多同志協助經撿工作，解除不少困難，並由於戡建隊員工作精神之表現，使警局人員亦提高熱誠，嚴肅風氣，希望永遠保持密切合作。繼由王大隊長致答詞。茶會至五時許始散。</p>

<h3>投資者目標轉移　房地產欣欣向榮　房地產業公會策應廣廈萬間運動　集哮購置惇信路空地五畝餘建屋</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕八一九幣制改革，不啻替本市癱瘓已久的房地產業，注下了一針興奮劑。從客觀的環境看，各業市塲在重重的控制下，波動已縮到及小的幅度。然而從股票市塲和收兌金鈔方面溢出來的游資，終得找個歸宿，於是，房地產又重為一般投資者的寵兒了。</p>
<p>不過，作為投資者寵兒的房地產，依然祗限於下述的兩種：（一）可以居住的空屋，（二）可以建築房屋之空地。據估計，合於這種條件的房地產，不過佔全市房地產總額五分之一左右，籌碼有限，而供售者少，搜求者多，那就母怪價格要愈抬愈高了。八一九後，這類房地產價格之增漲率，已自初期的二三成，以達於最近的一倍。除了這類房地產之外，其他像工廠或棚戶區的空地，佔用了的里弄住宅公寓之類，非但價格沒有起色，連交易也稀零得可憐。</p>
<p>滬西最俏漲起一倍</p>
<p>據保守的估計，最近地價的增漲率，以滬西區最俏，平均漲起四成至一倍。例如滬西愚園路最好地段的空地，目前市價每畝約八萬元，折合四十根大條子。連嚴次的每畝也在四萬元左右。大西路靠近靜安寺的一段，每畝價也要七萬元，再向西的稍廉，但最低的也快要三萬元一畝。其他像惇信路一帶，每畝約自四萬至六萬元。安和寺路一帶每畝約自三萬至六萬元。據說，連到龍華機塲必經的謹記路，兩旁的空地，刻亦喊到三萬元一畝了。</p>
<p>其他各區的地價，挨着增漲率的大小論次序，該是虹口區，南市區，閘北區，滬東區了。這些區域裏的空地，增漲率雖不及滬西區的凶猛，但就地段的好壞論，最好的也有漲達一倍的，最次的至少漲二成，至於中區一帶，房屋早已櫛比鱗次，空地如鳳毛麟角，物色最難，價也最貴，自又當別論了。</p>
<p>半年以內建屋萬幢</p>
<p>地價日增，交易當然也欣欣向榮。據地政局祝局長談，八一九前，該局承辦房地產過戶的案件，每天不到十件。八一九後，過戶案件與日俱增，最近每天過戶的案件，已增加到二十件以上。所以單從地政局過戶案件的多寡，來衡量八一九後房地產的交易額，說他增加一倍，當也不為多。至交易的對象，以一二畝的空地為大宗。</p>
<p>地政當局，為了配合財政經濟緊急措施，最近施策，亦在鼓勵游資投向房地產，特別是興建房屋，地政局祝局長曾表示，最近成立的本市房屋興建策淮委員會，決定在半年之內，促成「廣厦萬間」運動。這個運動，預備在半年內，在本市各區落成新屋一萬幢。對興建房屋的業主，決予種種優遇，例如：（一）免地價稅三年，（二）免房捐一年，如果購地後在半年內造屋，一年內出售者，更免征土地增值稅。同時，對新屋水電設備，交通條件，均將盡市政府的力量，予以種種的便利。最近更擬在滬西，南市，閘北，滬東，浦東五區劃分新的住宅區，這些住宅區，都將限期興建房屋。如果在限期內不予興建的話，就要開征空地稅。這種空地稅，是按地價稅三倍起征，一年半之內，就將遞加到十倍，這對地主是一種壓迫，逼使他向興建新屋的一條路走，倒也是解決本市房荒的一助。祝局長表示對這個「廣厦萬間」運動，有充份的把握使他完成。</p>
<p>房地產業的新組織</p>
<p>現在首先策應這個「廣厦萬間」運動的，有本市房地產業同業公會，由該會同業集體主力房屋建設委會，現在巳組成第一投資集團，已經購就惇信路空地五畝五分，成交價約在二十萬元之譜。這個集團預備在這塊空地上，再投資造本四十萬元，計劃建築單幢住宅四十幢，或雙幢住宅二十幢，房崖的式樣正在研究設計中，預期在三個月內全部落成。這可說是整個運動的一個序幕，希望投資者能羣起響應，解救一下本市的房荒問題。</p>
<p>照目前有利的客觀環境看，蟄伏多年的房地產業，必將有他復蘇的前途。充其量，當局祗要把與民生有關的房租管制住，此外房地產本身的價格，在百物限價唯我無限的情形下，當有充份活動的餘地，自然更易使房地產成為游資費集的目標了。</p>

<h3>難民移懇江西　已屆實施階段　首批三千五百人即將開始登記</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政當局為救濟流亡來滬難胞，組織移墾隊，前往江西墾殖荒地，此項計劃，現已臻實施階段。上海市救濟委員會原計劃第一期移住家屬五千戶，每戶以四人計，共計二萬人，經與江西省府接洽後，先送三千五百人。救濟委員會已造具預算，包括到達目的地後建棚，購買耕牛·傢具·工具與六個月之主副食費等，共需十八萬另四百二十金圓，六個月後所植之番薯等成畏，已可自力更生。救濟會現正在籌措該項經費，並將於最近派員赴江西部署一切，返滬後卽開始辦理登記遣送出發。</p>
<p>可容難胞七萬</p>
<p>據調查江西全省現有荒地達七十八萬八千九百畝之多，如以一人墾殖十畝計，可能容納難胞七萬人。首批遣送之三千五百人，預定分配墾殖地點如下：德興二百人，德安一百人，永修五百人，資溪一百人，黎川一百人，崇仁一百人，樂安二百人，吉口水三一百人，安福一千一百人，泰如三百人，萬安二百人，南豐一百人，廣昌二百人。</p>
<p>施行普遍調查</p>
<p>救濟會因移墾江西為本市救濟事業主要決策之一，為防止少數職業難民意圖留滬度其依賴生活，對不參加之難胞將施行普遍調查，凡（一）經醫生檢定其身心健全而能操勞作業者，（二）曾經務農在三年以上而經證明者，（三）凡年在十六以上四十五歲以下無特殊或顯著病象者，均應參加移墾，否則將限期遣送返籍。</p>

<p>一週經濟</p>
<h3>一般物價　物價由疲回堅　大多漲限度</h3>
<p>自財政經濟緊急處分頒行以來，截至上週末止，巳經過約四十天。人民持有金銀外幣的兌換限期，原規定為九月底，本可吿一段落，現又延展一月，至十月底截止。我們看看新經濟方案實施後這一　多月來的情况，亟應改進的地力還是不少。大體言之：</p>
<p>（一）據佔計目前滬市游資　積達四億圓以上，幷聞東北匯款入關辦法已予取消，預料將有大量資　流至平津，轉入滬市。當局對於游資迄木能有效的疏導，這對　方案始終是一個大威脅。</p>
<p>（二）實施限價以來，因為規定於硬性，以致若干成品與原料間的　係，得不到合理的調整，對於　加　置頗有影響。同時本埠與　埠之間，因為物價水準不同，本埠物資企圖向外逃避，外埠原料土產部長縮不來，</p>
<p>（三）當局對於國人在外資產的管理與運用，似乎顯得行動很遲緩，而對國內人民金銀外幣的兌換，執行甚為積極，相形之下，不僅顯得處理有失公平，且在需用外匯急迫的今日，政府放鬆了這個對象，令人不無本末倒置之感。</p>
<p>上週市塲物價走勢，初因懾於當局的管制，舉辦物資總登記，人心虛軟，略露疲態，但隨卽紛紛回升，多站漲限，若千貨品，又陷停市或半停市狀態。</p>
<p>棉紗市塲，藍鳳紗仍無行情，廿一支雙馬週初因登記存貨關係，價低見七百六十元，但自週二以至週五，屹立七百八十三元。觀頭細布較有起伏，以週一二之廿六元四角為最低，週四之廿八元為最高。</p>
<p>糧食市塲，食米因產區價格上漲，形成倒掛現象，來源稀少，市上高檔貨絕跡，南北兩市塲上白粳行情，始終為二十元七角八分與二十元九角。粉市全停頓，雜糧僅少數做開，多種陷入半停狀態。食油市勢堅挺，靑島凈生浊價一週來均站五十九元九角未動。日用品走勢，亦頗露秀色，週五固本皂站廿六元八角，較前週末之廿五元六角漲一元二角，美麗火柴週末站一百一十九元，較前週末之一百一十七元漲二元，捲烟因派貨稀少，供不應求，市上雜牌貨見多。</p>
<p>當局為加强經濟管制起見，經行政院會議決議通遇，將已設之上海·平津·廣州·三督導區域範圍擴大，並增設華中區一處。計（一）上海區：京滬兩市暨蘇浙皖三省，（二）廣州區：廣州市及粵閩兩省。（三）平津區；平津靑三市及冀魯兩省。（四）漢口：漢渝兩市及鄂湘川贛四省。至對於加强經濟管制，控制物資及舉辦全面配售事宜，曾由翁院長召集有關官員，舉行談話會，交換意見，認為各地情形均極良好，惟尙有下列現象：</p>
<p>（一）目前上海一地嚴格執行經濟管制，致造成上海若干重要工業原料價格反較產地為低，因而有斷絕來源之趨勢，對於生產事業影響頗大，故有全面在各主要地區間時加强實行經濟管制必要。</p>
<p>（二）全國各主要地區之物價，因八一九各項限價高低不一，有超過當時合理價格者，亦有不足維持成本之價格者，兩者均將根據其實際情形，予以調整，以謀平衡，並免物資逃避。</p>
<p>（三）各地人民對新幣雖極愛護，然銀行存款數字之增加，並未達到理想。為加强人民對金圓券信心，應特別緊縮金圓券之發行，卽對過去以發行彌補赤字措施，決予根絕。至對控制物資及配售問題，認為供應方面決定由經管會擬定加强控制物資辦法，由政府向產區收購，分配方面則繼續實行非全面之配售制度，於各大都市就主要民生日用品作合理之配售。但收購物資以分區收購，並核定適常價格，而不刺激產區價格為主，同時配合貸款政策，鼓勵商民收購，俾使物資來源充裕。</p>
<p>關於滬市經管當局，舉辦物資總登記一案，已於九月廿九日下午六時截止。據發表登記物品種類及數量如次：</p>
<p>（一）食油商業公會計會員四八四家，登記豆油·生油·生菜油·熟生油·蔴油·靑油·普通油·共計一〇一，三五七市擔十四斤</p>
<p>（二）雜糧業公會各會員三百十九家，所存黃豆，總共計八三，八三七包。</p>
<p>（三）人浩絲二一八〇餘箱，生絲八〇〇餘擔，棉紗各支紗綫四二〇餘件，</p>
<p>（四）蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會所屬國營紡建公司本市各廠，所存棉花二十二萬餘市擔，羊毛一百廿五萬餘磅，各種棉布一百五十餘萬疋，棉紗一萬四千餘件，其中半製成品尙未在內。至於該業公會所屬本市民營紗廠所存花紗布數量未發表。</p>
<p>（五）棉布商商業公會截至九月二十九日止，共收到各會員行號登記表一四八二份，總額計棉布一，四六五，二六七疋。五二一，〇八三段。又一七五，五〇八碼。二，四〇二公尺。一六，一六二磅。及被單八三九條，約合疋額二百萬疋。</p>
<p>繼物資總登記後卽開始物資總檢查，檢查辦法照上海市警區劃分為三十二區，總檢查之物品決定為米·食油·麵粉·布·紗·紙·慶·及工業原料中之棉·煤·及機動油，（指汽油與柴油言）。檢查日期原定三日，現決議儘量縮短，可能於二日內完畢。至當局前准許旅客機帶禁運物資之規定，現因單帮客活躍，結夥携運出境，物資偸　非淺，乃決定將該項規定暫行停止適用。</p>
<p>照人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法規定，收兌黃金白銀外幣限期，原定九月三十日截止·現經政院決定，收兌黃金外幣決展至十月底，收兌白銀·銀元·銀角展期至十一月底·上週在延期兌換公布前，人民兌換金鈔者，異常踴躍，國行每日兌出金圓券均在二千餘萬至三二千餘萬元。據統計滬市一地，自八月二十三日起至九月三十日止，收兌之金銀外幣數字，共為三億七千二百四十八萬二千七百一十五圓八角。</p>
<h3>貨幣金融　上週銀根鬆勢依然加故　金銀外匯兌換激增金圓券流出　業內業外多單如毛外拆感困難</h3>
<p>上週本市銀根，依舊鬆濫逾恒。在改幣以前，銀根尙有一鬆一緊的週期性現象表現，但改革以後，資金供需失調，供給源源而來，需求却踟躕不前，於是游資的泛濫，竟有日積月累之勢。決定上週銀根繼續鬆濫的因素，約有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）金銀外幣之兌換，已屆九底截止之期，一般人民間尙捉摸不到當局竟決定以原限再延長一個月，因之兌換者大為增加，金圓券的供給又多添一批生力軍。</p>
<p>（二）國家行局，一週來雖有糖稅等收款，但另一面因大量收購物資等支出，致票據交換結果，仍是無日無差出，至上週週五止，行局已經連續廿天的差出了，差出總額，亦已達四千萬金圓以上，這樣長時期的差出，在勝利以後，也是初次，對市塲資金的供源，當然起了很大的作用。</p>
<p>（三）北方戰事吃緊，游資又紛紛南流，週一當局已決定東北匯款，取消限額，自然，在安全第一的原則下，北方匯款解訖本市，其數量之鉅，可以意想。</p>
<p>（四）時屆九底十初，各業雖因發薪等支出，需現股切，又因金圓券携帶方便，日來現鈔南流，其勢亦甚洶湧，但終以本市籌碼底存豐厚，毫未顯露絀象。</p>
<p>（五）自前週以來，短期國庫券售出者，為數雖頗可觀，總額已達五千萬元以上，但與本市為數四五億以上之游資相比，不啻小巫見大巫，籌碼得以回籠者，不過十分之一强，對銀根之抽緊，作用至微。</p>
<p>（六）上週週一，本市益大昶錢莊，奉令停業，又週三，雲南礦業銀行本市分行，亦以業務淸淡等原因，自動結束，並退出票據交換所。不難推測，加强金融管制之結果，資金之需求者，多踟躕不前，這也就阻滯了游資一部份的去路，銀根之長見鬆濫，自與之不無關聯</p>
<p>使銀根鬆濫的若干原因，旣無法根本剷除，於是乎游資形成暗流，有隙便鑽；利息頻降，持單者每有不易外拆之苦。上週銀錢業掛牌利息，於週五（十月一日）起，再見抑低，計存息為一分五（原為一分八，）欠息為四分八（原五分七，）同業拆息為三分（原三分九。）上週暗息，大致站四分半至六分之間，最低甚至有三分者，普遍已降至銀錢業牌息以下。惟其間時期較長之放就，月息較高，如半”期者約做一角五分，一月以上者，可做一角八分，這裏亦可反映出一般對金融前途的看法，並不樂觀·上週貨帮貼息，亦續見降低，大致為日拆二元，週三甚至有一度低至一元者，僅合息三分而已。</p>
<p>上週國家行局仍見速績差出，自週一至週五，計共差出一千〇九十三萬圓，較前週同期內僅减出二十餘萬元。</p>
<p>洋商銀行交換結果，每日或進或出，頗有差次，其間如週三週五為差出，週一週二週四幾天有差進，但五夭合計，尙軋進二百卅九萬元，較前週同期內减進一百六十九萬餘元。</p>
<p>商業行莊，一週來頭寸寬裕如前，多單普遍，同業拆放停頓，本市六十號以後行莊交換結果，自週一至週五，計共差進六百十六萬元，但其間尙包括合灣銀行同期內十七萬元的差出。故商業行莊間接交換，實際當為差進六百三十三萬元，較前週同期內尙增進一百七十餘萬元</p>
<p>至於上週商業銀行之內匯率，無甚波動，廣州匯水始終為二十四元，厦匯匯水為二十元，漢匯匯水為十元，渝匯匯水週一為十元，週三加二元為十二元，昆明匯水為十二元，天津匯水五元。</p>
<p>又香港黃金行市稍有起伏，週一每華兩金價為三百〇八港元又七角五分，週二突升至三百十五元半，週三週四回落，價為三百〇九元五角。香港美鈔市價，勢呈下游，週一週二為五元二角三分，週三週四則縮至五元一角九分。</p>
<h3>紐約中國現代畫展　介紹找民族優秀傳統及創造精神　雙十節在都城美術館開幕</h3>
<p>〔本報紐約航訊〕中國現代繪畫展覽會，經六個月之籌備，將於今年雙十節在紐約都城美術館開幕。此一國際性之美術展覽會，將連續舉行兩月。都城美術館乃全美最著名之第一美術陳列館，收藏東方及歐洲美術作品旣富且精，堪與巴黎羅佛館及倫敦大不列顛美術館媲美。此次我國畫展在該館舉行，必將鬨動全美，引起彼邦朝野人士之注意，自屬意料中事。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「盛世」與「危言」</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>從前曾經看過一本呌做「盛世危言」的書，原著者是一位什麽道台，是提倡實業救國的。這本著作是甲午之後寫的，那時中國的紙老虎早已揭穿，因而雜新的口號喊得特別響，這位作者當然也是「應運而起」的一位。至於其寫作的動機，是純粹的愛護祖國，或者含有取巧的作用，這裏不預備多作探討。不過他倡導的若千計劃，現在看起來固不免是老生常談，但在當時卻也頗「切中時弊」，而尤使我注意的，則是「盛世危言」這一書名。</p>
<p>甲午之後的中國而稱「盛世」，當然是書生的機警，但在專制時代却不能不如此「取巧」。而「危言」的來源，雖則似乎出於「居安思危」這一句成語，有預防危機於萬一和鞏固「盛世」的酒義，但在人人自以為「安」的「盛世」中，居然育發「危言」，這一點作者似乎足以自豪，而亡淸的專制也有點天眞的可愛了。</p>
<p>拿現在情形說，抗戰之後繼以戡亂，烽火連天，災黎遍週，而國際方面，旣有冷戰，又有熱戰，我們卽再能閉關自守，也不足以稱「盛世」，是不能諱言的。然而我們的「危言」呢？。</p>
<p>把自己能看到的書報（當然，為了經濟和時間，我看得很少）歸納起來，不外乎；</p>
<p>（一）一味瞎捧的歌功頌德；（二）另有作用的謗毀謾罵；（三）自以為幽默的冷嘲熱諷；（四）百無聊賴的翻弄古董；這還是上焉者的。此外，如：女人的大腿，歌星或明星的起居注，黃色新聞的渲染，更充滿在若干刊物的篇幅裏。</p>
<p>在專制時代還有「危言」，而我們幸而生在民主時代的今日，則只有好聽的話，含有毒素的話，無聊的和肉麻的話；這是一個多殘酷的對照。居安尙且怕危，而我們在危如累卵的局勢下，尙優哉游哉，自得其樂，這又是一個多麽可恥的麻木！</p>
<p>當然整天地哭喪着臉或靠在沙法上大聲疾呼，是不能挽救危局的，卽使是前綫剿匪的士兵，不是也要休息和娛樂嗎？然而萬不能放棄本位工作，卻是最要緊的一着。時勢如此，難道居於領導社會地位的文化人，今日的本位工作，是：瞎攻瞎捧，是應聲虫，是造謠亂罵，是翻掘陳死人，是陶醉於歌星的櫻唇，女人的紛腿？</p>
<p>魯迅先生似曾在香港發表過一篇「無聲的中國」的演詞，這在今天還是一個有力的敎　，因為他希望的不是上述的那些亂糟糟地無聊的聲音，而是眞正的人的聲音。我們現在也眞確切需要眞正的人的聲音！</p>
<p>「危言」是不大好聽的名詞，但「危言」的作用却能促進「盛世」的實現，倒是事實。「忠言逆耳」的涵義，在此不在彼。</p>
<h3>怪遺囑</h3>
<p>— 帆</p>
<p>一個古怪的英國人在他的遺囑中吩咐他的家屬要把他好好地埋葬在一座堅固的陵墓裏。理由是他不願意讓他的親戚們來吃他。他的理由是：「泥土里的蟲會先將我吃掉，然後趨子會將蟲吃掉，然後我的親戚會將鴨子吃掉。」</p>
<h3>「晚食當肉」</h3>
<p>— 售牛</p>
<p>自從八一九限價以來，小菜塲猪肉已幾乎絕跡，牛肉也不易買到，如今要想吃肉也不是一件容易事了，不禁想起了古人「晚食當肉」的話來。初一想，這個辦法確是很聰明，但再仔細一想，再實際做一下試試看，便會使你啼笑皆非了。先餓上半天再吃，雖然沒有肉，但飢不擇食，吃起來自然會感到比平常有肉的還有味。姑不論其生理上的許多問題，先說這句話是出於一國大臣之口—「安步當車，晚食當肉。」以一國大員而自奉如此儉樸，在今日中國的情形來說，總不能算不好，但問題就在自己旣然不坐車，不吃肉，又何必心中存着一個以吃肉為最高標準的念頭？可見還是想吃。這便好像是說我並不是不喜歡吃肉，但是我偏不吃，而又想出這樣一個聰明的辦法來，證出來讓皇帝聽聽，這其中多少含有點媚上的意思，還帶點阿Q的精神，而不知不覺的便露出馬脚來了。不吃肉，何不痛痛快快的提倡素食養生—何必「當肉」呢？如果此公生於現在，當了甚麼委員，提倡節約的話，一定要大顯身手，說不定玩出甚麼更可笑的把戲來。</p>
<p>孔子似乎很注重營養，覺得吃肉好，便高唱「七十非肉不飽」，絕無不好意思，而自己「三月不知肉味」，便刺刺不休，大發牢騷，這樣不怕難為情，天眞誠實，倒是可愛的。</p>
<h3>次奉和姚監察雛寄詩</h3>
<p>— 散木</p>
<p>人生無百年，盈冲况居半，嗟此霹靂手，老猶抱秃翰，將非媚世人，豈曰自怡玩？酒酣　得喪，明月照我腕。姚侯今公榮，念茲襟髮散，新詩遠寄將，激辭資共歎。吾儕守窮骨，肯隨人事換？出門向西笑，警紱胡璀璨，本非午金珠，焉用綠　鍛？季世值　　，秋氣更　澹，斫殺遍九土，羣有苦奔竄，濟濟匡時士，空言紛條段，吾自任吾眞，掩耳謝理亂，一醉忘魏晋，於何更有漢！</p>
<h3>一烟之微</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>一年到頭我只買兩樣東西：烟與書，故米價柴價我可不問不聞，烟價却「市面靈通」。當物價波動之際，我常說我的壽命要給烟價的日升夜漲减去幾年。貴還仕其次，譬如說前門牌要買幾百萬一包，祗要一年半載不波動，要吃的買去，不要的不買可也。可怕的是早晚市價不同，上午十點鐘百萬一包，下午三點鐘一百二十五萬：給你神經或心理上一個早晚不安，我想可以短我壽命。現在好了，某種烟有一定價錢，上月如此，本月亦然，下月仍舊。我袋裏如有三角金圓，隨便什麼時候就可得前門一包，心定神安，一定延年益壽。</p>
<p>不過聽說較好之烟或熱門之烟不易購得了。這個我尙未身受，只從簡接知之。原來我今天購前門五包，隨便問了一句店員：「　不霉？」誰知引笑了一個在旁購某種烟四條的顧客，說：「買也買不大到，還要問霉不霉。」我也笑了，說：「你的意思是買不大到的烟雪了也好的？」</p>
<p>「自然　。」</p>
<p>「部麽我有雪烟你要不要？」</p>
<p>「要呀，有多少要多少。」</p>
<p>裏邊另一個店員也笑了，對我說：「你是買去吸的，所以要問霉不霉；他是買去做生意的，故只要有貨不問霉爛。」</p>
<p>唔，原來如此。我不想責備這位烟販子的不道德，只知賺錢不顧買客的健康，因為我知道堂堂行政院物資供應局也以大量霉烟供應着國人，且獲德政之口碑。我只責備我自己的胡塗：物稀之秋還論好壞。</p>
<p>但這不僅是我個人如此，四萬萬同胞之中恐莫不如此。物價平定是大家揭望歡迎的，但怨聲也就截道了：五十一型派克筆買不到了，鷄只有雄鷄應市，遲去了一點就沒得了，等等。這怨聲原亦人情之常，只是有一點大家不大想到，就是在非常時期，欲求物價平定，物必稀少；欲在非常時期買便宜東西而應有盡有，事實上決無可能。何以故？理由甚簡單：我們是只靠洋貨，單帮，或走私而才有美皆備無麗不臻的國家，現在不能漫天漲價，也就無利可岡，於是做進口生意的單帮客人走私鉅子一一改行，而百物於是乎皆缺。把好東西藏起來不賣還在其次，而且　下去藏者必吃其虧，吿訴做筆生意朋友一聲：美國最流行的派克，已經不是五十一型而是一〇二型了。</p>
<p>又便宜又應有盡有的國家世界上朱嘗沒有，但中國人却要這樣想一想，誰呌你自己不會造一百零二型自來水水　　？</p>
<h3>寫給美國議員的信</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>美國國會議員們不時收到各種人民寫給他們的信。這些信件，隊了正經的以外，亦不乏妙趣盎然者，現摘譯數則，以饗本刋讀者。（收信人及發信人姓名均從略。）</p>
<p>我知道你有免費寄信的特權。</p>
<p>現奉上我的全部賀年片，請你替我將它們寄掉如何？</p>
<p>謝謝。</p>
<p>我投過你三次票，我認為你是可欽佩的。請立卽送給我九百塊錢，讓我買一隻冰箱，把我的車子也重新漆一下。</p>
<p>附言：我是在一九四六年的選岑中投你三次票的。</p>
<p>我的朋友們全都收集電影明星的照片，但我却要與衆不同，因此，請你送給我十二位議員的照片。請細心的選擇，以滑稽的面孔最佳。</p>
<p>請爲我的房子做點事情龍——我的屋頂漏了。</p>
<p>當昨夜暴風雨的時候，我正在吃晚飯，屋頂漏得糟不可言，我的湯竟連滿三次。</p>
<p>請提出一條法案，或者發表一次演說，或者做一點什麽事情·再這樣下去，我眞不能記得你是誰了。</p>
<h3>鑑別珠寶</h3>
<p>— 冀雲</p>
<p>本報載鑽寳獎券卽將發行，逆產各寳，已經專家詳為鑑別，並評定價格。偶有友人論及鑑別寳物，殊為不易，時有汪君在座，謂鑑評價值，固非熟悉市情者不能，若僅辨眞偽，則尙簡易，因述辦別之法。汪君老於典業者也，其言或當不謬，略記於左：</p>

<p>翡翠：用金器磨之，能磨出金屑者為眞，否則為偽。</p>
<p>瑪瑙：以瑪瑙研末，不熱者為眞，發熟者為偽。</p>
<p>琥珀：以琥珀在手心磨熱，能黏拾芥子者為眞，否則為偽。</p>
<p>珍珠：將珠置暗室內，遠立視之，能發竇光者為眞，暗而作灰色者為偽。</p>

<p>以上各節，質之當代鑑別家，以為然否。</p>
<h3>由三輪車想起</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>我對「三輪車光生」（按卽駕駛者的流行尊稱）的不怕死精神，素極欽佩；在前後左右車輛四面園攻的形勢下，「三輪先生」大都能奮不顧身地，伸肘一攔，便大轉其灣。其視死如歸，英勇服務的精神，確也不易，可惜這精神一經「推己及人」，則身為乘客者，便往往被弄得驚魂不定，性命交關。譬如說，當一個大卡車的「虎口」，「三輸先生」「死人不管」地把三輪車前半段穿越而過，而乘客性命所寄的後半段，好像與他無關，由是首遭犧牲者是乘客。不久前，西摩路上一輛橫衝直撞的「三輪」，以突然煞車，車一震動，女客一名剛好跌進無軌電車輪下，身首異處！</p>
<p>雖然如此，三輪車之紅　却歴久不衰，一度並有「鴛鴦事」之別稱，足見上海正多勇敢的乘客。因此，改幣以後什麽物價都被凍結，唯獨三輸車一躍數倍，原為四十萬元的，今則非四角莫辦，稍遠，討價一元以上者也不希奇，更有甚者，此輩『三翰先生』裏情嚴　，鐵面無私，與小菜場的肉販同工異曲。我最不喜歡看他們的「面孔」，尤其當下大雨，括大風的時候。所以我偶爾坐三輪車，也都在晴天；大風雨的時候，我情願犧牲衣服候電車，因為我痛恨「乘人之危」的敲竹楓！</p>
<p>以前，「三輪先生」的口頭轉是：大餅贊多少錢了？米賣多少錢了？而現在大餅仍然六萬法幣一隻，戶口米價二月未動，車租也未更動，為什麽車錢還要這樣漲呢？以前三輪車價約比公共汽車或電事高一情餘，電車汽車漲價，他們跟　漲；而現在：不特電車汽車原價未勳，三輪軍却遭高數債！尤場注意者：此漫天呌價的現觀至今尙未停止，近週以來，每過二三天，三輪車價必比前二三天又高出若干。</p>
<p>這是什麽道理呢？「三輪先生」的唯一理由是：警局罰款加了，但難道天天遭罰？頃閱報載：警局已因此而减低罰款了，然而是否足使他們己漲得成習慣的高價壓低呢？恐怕未必。</p>
<p>其實問題是在：「你不乘，自有乘的人。」正和小菜塲一樣，只要藏起來不賣，主顧們便屈服了：「好，好，價錢照你說好了。」</p>
<p>造成這現象的是少數富有的消費者，他們滿不在乎，不加計較。於是「漫天討價」旣百無禁忌；黑市也就應運而發生了。</p>

<h3>Xu Water Recovered, National Armies of North and South Joined Forces. Pingbao Highway Fully Opened. Intense Fighting Erupted Again in the Qinhuangdao-Shanhaiguan Area. The Liaoxi Wind and Rain Calmed the Jinzhou Area.</h3>
<p>[Our Bao Ding Correspondent, 3rd] Military authorities announced: The Pingbao line war situation took a sharp turn. Zheng Tingfeng's southward advance force recovered Xushui County at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. At 12:00 PM, they joined forces with Li Shilin's National Army, which had moved north from Baoding, at Jing Tangpu on the north bank of the Caohe River. Baoding city celebrated wildly. The Pingbao Highway, which had been cut off for more than three months, was completely opened. At 3:00 PM, a rapid deployment force had already arrived in the provincial capital.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] After the North and South National Armies joined forces on the Pingbao line, they immediately divided their forces to encircle and suppress the main force of the bandit's 7th Column on both the east and west sides of the highway. The bandits fled at the sight of the advancing armies. The eastern National Army was pressing toward Da Yin Town east of Xushui, and the western army had reached Suicheng Town north of Mancheng. The prelude to the annihilation battle in western Hebei has begun.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] All the bridge works on the Beihe Great Iron Bridge section of the Pingbao line and between the Xushui Caohe River, as well as the damaged highways, were repaired on the 3rd. Automobiles on the Pingbao line can resume operations within one or two days. Prices in Baoding turned sluggish on the afternoon of the 3rd. Another report: The highest military and political authorities in North China are preparing to use more than 100 trucks daily to transport coal and grain to Bao Yuan, which will take a month.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 3rd] Fighting erupted again in the Qinhuangdao-Shanhaiguan area. This morning at midnight, the telephone line between Shanhaiguan and Xiaomaoshan was suddenly cut off. Shanhaiguan was attacked by a unit of communist bandits. The defending troops engaged in fierce fighting with the attacking communist bandits. Yesterday and today, remnant communists have also been causing disturbances on the periphery of Qindao.</p>
<p>[Our Tangshan Correspondent, 3rd] The war situation in western Liaoning is developing subtly. The communist bandits seem to be redeploying. The National Army is seizing time to gain the initiative. The situation around Yuguan is becoming more stable. A unit of the National Army's Lin Corps was ordered to re-enter Changli on the afternoon of the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 3rd] In the Jinzhou area of western Liaoning, the war was quiet on the 3rd due to wind and rain. There were only engagements five kilometers south of the southern suburbs at Han Wangdian and seven kilometers northeast. Communist bandits were harassing in small groups, but they were all repelled.</p>
<p>[Our Jinzhou Correspondent, 2nd] (1) The bandits besieging Qiansuo (between Yu and Sui) suffered heavy casualties when National Army reinforcements arrived and attacked from both inside and outside. Fierce fighting continued on the 2nd. (2) Communication between Xingcheng and the outside world has been cut off. The National Army may have shifted to a favorable area to continue fighting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] The battle of Yixian, which has been fought bitterly for over ten days, has now lost contact.</p>
<h3>The President Decides to Temporarily Sit in Beiping, Encouraging Military and Political Personnel in Shenyang to Cooperate Practically. Overall Planning for Military Affairs in Northeast and North China.</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 3rd] President Chiang Kai-shek left Shenyang by plane at 11:15 AM on the 3rd and arrived safely in Beiping at 1:00 PM. The President visited the Summer Palace in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 3rd] It has been learned here that the President flew from Beiping to Shenyang at 12:10 PM on the 2nd. Zhou Zhirou, Guo Chan, and Yu Jishi accompanied him. Wei Lihuang also accompanied him to Shenyang. Zhao Jiaxiang returned to Shenyang first to make arrangements. Wang Tiehan, Dong Wenqi, Liao Yaoxiang, Gao Xibing, and others greeted him at the airport. The President wore a military uniform with a yellow cloak with five-star badges. After getting off the plane, he nodded frequently to those welcoming him and said, "Good, good." He then took a car to the Lizhi Society residence to rest and met with Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Dong Yingbin, Wang Tiehan, Dong Wenqi, Xu Liang, Liao Yaoxiang, and others. After a brief inquiry, the leaders excused themselves. After lunch, the President rested for an hour. At 3:00 PM, he personally presided over a military conference at the Suppression Headquarters. All military leaders in Shenyang participated. It lasted for two hours. The President left the Suppression Headquarters at 5:00 PM to return to his residence for rest. At 6:00 PM, he visited the Suppression Headquarters again and summoned members of the Political Committee and senior officials from various provinces to hear reports on the political situation. At 7:00 PM, he hosted a dinner at the Suppression Headquarters, and all military and political leaders were invited to attend. After dinner, the President met with each leader individually, inquiring in great detail. The meeting ended late at night. This was the President's fourth visit to Shenyang. There were slight security precautions on the streets. Citizens were aware of the President's visit to Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiyang, 3rd] President Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech to the members of the Political Committee, heads of provinces and cities, and commanders of various units at 6:00 PM on the 2nd, hoping that the party, government, and military would be of one heart and one mind, cooperate with the military, and complete the great task of suppressing the rebellion. He instructed armed comrades to have the spirit of sacrificing their lives for the sake of righteousness, and to work hard to suppress the bandits. After the speech, there was a dinner. During the dinner, the President repeatedly urged the military and government to cooperate practically and defeat the bandits. He also emphasized that the military and government must obey the orders of Commander-in-Chief Wei and launch a total war effort. The President praised Commander-in-Chief Wei's achievements in turning the situation in Northeast China from danger to safety over the past six months. At 8:00 PM, he summoned the commanders of various units for another speech. At 8:30 AM on the 3rd, he met with Liao Yaoxiang and Zhou Fucheng at his residence. At 9:00 AM, he met with Wang Tiehan, Dong Wenqi, and others, instructing them on everything. At 10:00 AM, he summoned the responsible persons of the Shenyang press to listen to the actual situation of the Shenyang news industry and instructed them to work hard to cooperate with the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, and to strengthen reporting work. At 10:15 AM, he summoned Wei Lihuang, Ju Zhizhi, Guo</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Outer Defenses of Xu. The Fourth Pacification Zone Sets Up a Command Post in Shangqiu. National Army in Western Shandong Continues to Advance Northward and Expand Gains.</h3>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Correspondent, 3rd] After the fall of Jinan, in order to strengthen the outer defenses of Xuzhou, the National Army's Fourth Pacification Zone has established a command post in Shangqiu and abandoned Heze in western Shandong. A certain unit originally stationed there has been transferred to the vicinity of Shangqiu. A certain army corps originally reinforcing Jinan is now stationed again along the Xushang line, closely monitoring the bandits' next move.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Correspondent, 3rd] The front line in western Shandong has been experiencing continuous autumn rain for the past two weeks. Today, the weather has cleared, and the sun is shining brightly. The air force has also begun to take action. The great battle in western Shandong will unfold as the weather clears.

<h3>The Far East Marshall Plan. The US Officials have Finished the Draft. The Total Amount is Several Billion US Dollars, Targeting China, India, and the Philippines. It is Planned to Obtain Aid Funds from US Investors.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] According to the Washington Forward Times here, some members of Congress have secretly learned about the so-called Far East Marshall Plan of several billion US dollars, which has been drafted by a dozen government officials. This plan will be implemented with US funding. It is reported that the main steps of the plan are targeting China, India, and the Philippines, while Japan is not included. The current plan does not want Japan to obtain actual funds for production. The goal of the plan is to triple steel and electricity production, double cement and textile production, increase coal production by 5%, and cotton production by 25% in the East within ten years. The entire plan is quietly proceeding as a result of three economic conferences held by the United Nations in Shanghai, Baguio, and Ootacamund in the past two years. However, it is noteworthy that when the designers of the plan formally contacted the US State Department about the Far East aid plan not long ago, it is said that the State Department advised them not to think about submitting an appropriation request to Congress but indicated that American private investors and banks might be interested in the plan. The Forward Times also stated: The most annoying problem is how to obtain American assistance. Since most of the money taken from American citizens has already been promised to the European aid plan, internationalist factions in Congress are feeling distressed, fearing that the new Republican government will be indifferent to this new plan of tens of billions of US dollars used for the future of Asia. However, the designers of the plan are still hoping to obtain aid funds directly from American investors.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Make up for the Financial Deficit and Save Foreign Exchange. The Legislative Yuan Will Include it in the Eighth Meeting Tomorrow for Discussion.</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The eighth meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 5th. The government proposals included in the agenda for reporting matters include the draft revised Organic Law of the Civil Aviation Administration submitted by the Executive Yuan for review, the Colonization Law draft, and the proposed revision of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Demobilization. In addition to the cases not discussed at the previous meeting, the newly listed discussion items include four cases: (1) The Legal Committee's report on the draft regulations for the organization of the Committee for Reviewing the Qualifications of Drafters. (2) The Social Committee's report on the review of the draft Civil Servants Insurance Law. (3) Huang Tong and others' proposal for nationalizing land, common farming, calculating capital for interest, calculating labor for remuneration, using spare capacity for work, cooperative sharing, integrating workers and farmers, and uniting society as one family. (4) Yang Baodong and others' proposal to formulate measures to make up for the financial deficit, implement savings, and reduce foreign exchange in order to stabilize the economy and strengthen the foundation of the country.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] Legislative members Yang Baodong, Yao Tingfang, and 31 others recently submitted to the Legislative Yuan a "Proposal to formulate measures to make up for the financial deficit, implement savings, and reduce foreign exchange in order to stabilize the economy and strengthen the foundation of the country," which has been included in the agenda and is scheduled to be discussed at the regular meeting on the 5th. The proposal pointed out: More than a month after the currency reform, the economy is gradually stabilizing, and prices are also stabilizing, which is a good phenomenon unprecedented since the Anti-Japanese War. However, the country's finances still face many difficulties, and the task of suppressing the rebellion has not been completed due to (1) huge military expenditures, (2) a large and costly administrative organization, and (3) the extravagance of various institutions, which are extravagant and waste public funds. Therefore, it is proposed to formulate seven points of measures to make up for the financial deficit and save foreign exchange: (1) There are too many vacancies in the army, which greatly affects combat and military discipline. It is now proposed that the government organize a military discipline inspection team, with members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan participating in the organization, to separately inspect whether their combat is diligent, whether the number of people is sufficient, and whether the discipline is strict, and report truthfully to determine rewards and punishments, and order all vacancies to be filled or all funds to be returned to the national treasury. (2) All administrative institutions that are not significantly related to the war and national construction and that are duplicative should be abolished or merged. (3) The number of personnel in each institution should not be increased beyond the pre-war number. (4) The government's income and expenditure are inconsistent, estimated at about 30% to 40%, and the government organization is layered and redundant, with many redundant personnel and reduced efficiency, so all personnel should be reduced by 30% in order to match income and expenditure. Those who are laid off should be those with weak abilities and those who have families to return to and will not cause poverty. (5) Due to the expansion of the war zone and the turmoil in the countryside, talents are concentrated in the cities, resulting in an oversupply of people in the cities, while there is a lack of talents in the local areas, and government orders are difficult to implement. All laid-off personnel should be assigned to local agencies in order to strengthen local construction. (6) Except for necessities such as food and cotton yarn, the import of other unnecessary goods such as tobacco and cosmetics should be absolutely prohibited or significantly restricted. (7) Gasoline is a major consumer of the country's foreign exchange, and officials at all levels and wealthy merchants use cars to go to entertainment venues, travel to scenic spots, and transport students. Such consumption is huge and should be strictly prohibited. Therefore, it is stipulated that during the period of suppressing the rebellion, except for the heads and deputy heads of agencies and the post, medical, police, and construction companies due to official business needs, they may use official cars and transportation cars, and the people may ride public buses. All other public and private cars in the country should not be issued licenses and prohibited from use.</p>
<h3>Completion of Revised Budget for the Second Half of the Year; Revenue and Expenditure Approaching Balance; No Additional Budget Needed if Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 2nd] Following the currency reform, the revised central government ordinary and special budgets for the second half of the 37th year, using the Gold Yuan, have been drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and execution. According to reliable sources, the revised Gold Yuan budget was not simply a conversion of the original figures into Gold Yuan. Due to the implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Matters, the government's revenues and expenditures have significantly increased. The ratio of increased revenue to increased expenditure varies depending on the actual circumstances. On the revenue side, in accordance with the regulations for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic controls, government tax revenues have surged, particularly from national tobacco and alcohol taxes, income tax, salt tax, stamp tax, commodity tax, and customs duties. Stamp tax revenue in the new budget is almost thirteen times higher than in the original plan. National tobacco and alcohol taxes and income tax revenue have increased by about tenfold. Revenue from the sale of U.S. military surplus materials, lend-lease materials, enemy and puppet industry materials, and Japanese reparations materials under the special budget revenue item is calculated in U.S. dollars. Due to the increased U.S. dollar exchange rate, the revenue figures are also significantly higher. In addition, the sale of shares in state-owned enterprises, which was not included in the original budget, is now included. Based on the overall figures, the government's revenue in the revised budget for the second half of this year is estimated to be about four times the original budget. The ordinary budget's revenue and expenditure can still maintain balance, while the difference between special budget revenue and expenditure is about 20%. The government will devise other ways to compensate for this difference. U.S. aid of $400 million is not included in the above revenue items. Therefore, the deficit in the special budget can be covered with ease if U.S. aid is used effectively and expenses are reduced. On the expenditure side, for the same reasons, there has been a similar increase. The largest expenditure is the increased salaries for civil servants, teachers, and military officers and soldiers, which are about four times the original budget, in accordance with the regulations for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic controls. The operating expenses of various government agencies, after conversion to Gold Yuan, are very small and difficult to cover. Starting from September, these have also been adjusted separately, generally increasing by about 70%. Generally, the calculation standard is based on the number of employees, about ten yuan per person per month. Those exceeding this amount will be reduced, and those below will be increased. According to this calculation, it will increase by about five times. In the revised budget, the largest source of revenue for the ordinary budget is commodity tax, accounting for over 29%. Salt tax and customs duties are next, each accounting for over 17%. Income tax accounts for over 10%, stamp tax accounts for over 8%, and national tobacco and alcohol taxes account for over 5%. The largest expenditure is managed by the Ministry of National Defense, accounting for over 30%. Debt service expenditure accounts for over 18%. Finance and education expenditures each account for over 9%. Food and judicial administration expenditures each account for over 5%. The largest source of revenue for the special budget is revenue from the sale of state-owned property and materials, accounting for over 47%. Debt service revenue (part of which needs to be compensated) accounts for over 46%. The largest expenditure is managed by the Ministry of National Defense, accounting for over 67%. The Ministry of Food manages over 11%. The Ministry of Communications manages over 7%. Although the revised budget has undergone significant changes compared to the original budget, due to the sharp increase in revenue and the reduction in expenditure, the ordinary budget even has a surplus, and the deficit in the special budget has also decreased proportionally. The overall budget is closer to balance than the original plan. If prices do not fluctuate greatly during the year, this budget is expected to be executed as planned without any additional budget.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Appealing to World Opinion?</h3>
<p>Starting today, the United Nations Security Council will begin to address the accusations made by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France regarding the Berlin crisis. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin will all personally participate in the "public discussion" of the Berlin crisis. Although Western countries have requested the Security Council to take effective action on the Berlin issue, which has created a "threat to peace," even if the Soviet Union does not withdraw from the United Nations or refuse the Security Council to handle the matter, it will certainly exercise its "veto power," preventing the Security Council from reaching any results. Anyone with a little international knowledge knows that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France's appeal to the Security Council regarding the Berlin crisis is of no practical use. Even the diplomatic authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France understand that this move is merely a diplomatic offensive and do not hold excessive expectations.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France's appeal to the United Nations regarding the Berlin crisis, publicly accusing the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin as an act of violence that violates the Charter and threatens world peace, marks the first time in the past three years that the United Nations Security Council has handled disputes between the five powers. This particularly demonstrates the seriousness of the Berlin crisis, which has indeed reached a point where both sides must show their cards, making its significance very significant. Especially in recent days, Paris has become the center of world politics. The news broadcast from there seems to be filled with gunpowder, making the world, less than three years after the war, seem to be on the brink of war again. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, who participated in the Moscow negotiations from beginning to end, also said: "U.S.-Soviet relations have reached a very critical state."</p>
<p>Ambassador Smith's words are by no means alarmist, but a warning to both sides, who are moving toward extremes. In the magnificent Palais de Chaillot, in addition to hearing Soviet representative Vyshinsky's slamming of the table and cursing of "warmongers," we also heard British Foreign Secretary Bevin's condemnation of the Soviet Union's lack of sincerity for peace. He even openly advocated regional alliances, saying: "Because we cannot expect the United Nations to operate on a world-wide basis, we must proceed on a regional basis." French Foreign Minister Schuman and Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak also echoed their support for the Western countries. This shows the tension in the emotions of the representatives of various countries, and the "appeasement policy" toward the Soviet Union is already an impossible fact. Looking at the emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the five Western European countries, they resolutely decided to establish a joint defense headquarters and appointed British Chief of the General Staff Field Marshal Montgomery as the Supreme Commander of the Five-Nation Allied Forces. Obviously, Western Europe has embarked on the road of preparing for war as a precaution. How can this not cast a shadow of war over people's hearts?</p>
<p>But will the Berlin crisis lead to a new war? We can only observe this issue from two aspects. From the perspective of the Soviet Union, we have ample reason to believe that the Soviet Union does not want to use the Berlin incident as the starting point for a war, but only wants to use this incident as a diplomatic tool. First, there is currently no sign that the Soviet Red Army is prepared to take extraordinary action, nor is there any indication that the Soviet Union is sending large armies and military supplies to Western Europe. Moreover, various transportation lines from the Soviet Union to Western Europe have not yet been repaired. At this time, fighting would be absolutely unfavorable to the Soviet Union. Second, if the Soviet Union wants to attack Western Europe, it must use a large number of troops and equipment. At present, the Soviet Union has not yet fully met this condition. Not only has the rearmament not been completed, but the arms industry is also inadequate. Third, according to intelligence obtained in Washington, the Soviet Union is actively preparing for war, not preparing to take the offensive, but preparing to take the defensive. Fourth, the situation within the Iron Curtain is not stable. No matter where the Soviet Union attacks Western Europe from, its rear is unsafe. The situation in Yugoslavia has already been made clear, and even Poland and Czechoslovakia are unreliable. Therefore, from any angle, the timing, location, and popular support are not suitable for the Soviet Union to wage war against the United States at this time.</p>
<p>Looking back at the United States, although it is also filled with calls for "preventive war," and hawks believe that atomic war is "the sooner the better," those who advocate this behavior are in the minority. Because the blood of World War II has not yet dried, most people yearn for peace. Although the United States no longer adopts a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union, which is a common and consistent position of both the Democratic and Republican parties, it will certainly not take preemptive action and challenge the Soviet Union at this time. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to bring the Berlin issue to the Security Council does not necessarily mean that the United Nations should take action against the Soviet Union's actions that threaten peace. In reality, it is merely a diplomatic offensive. However, whether appealing this matter to world opinion can achieve the expected results and reverse the negative trends in the world is a major test of modern civilization.</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Beijing Authorities Study Comprehensive Rationing of Daily Necessities; Starting with Food and Cloth to Control General Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 3rd] Under the guidance of Zhang Lisheng, the Tianjin and Beijing authorities are conducting concrete studies on whether to fully implement the rationing of daily necessities. Merchants' disregard for controls has made the managing authorities feel acutely that they are facing a critical juncture. Tianjin and Beijing may start by fully rationing food and cloth to control general prices, while also promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas of Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei through the exchange of cloth for food. Although the grain price problem has been very serious recently, the reason why the authorities have not taken hasty measures is that they admit that merely treating the symptoms cannot solve the problem. A batch of grain merchants in Tianjin and Beijing have obtained loans from the national bank (2 million Gold Yuan in Tianjin City) to purchase grain in rural areas. The authorities have decided that the cloth currently available and to be produced by Tianjin Textile Mill will no longer be a target for speculation. It can have 500,000 bolts of cloth and 2,000 bales of yarn per month for civilian use in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei, and use it to exchange for raw cotton. The government will regularly control 10 million Gold Yuan as grain purchasing capital.</p>

However, the actual situation in remote areas and vast rural areas was not the same as in urban areas. In terms of implementation techniques, some discretion had to be exercised. Every time I arrived in a place, I first investigated the actual situation in detail, listened to the opinions of all parties, and followed the central government's orders to discuss concrete and feasible measures with the local military and political leaders, and then put them into practice. Therefore, efficiency has gradually increased. Regarding the surrender and declaration of gold, silver, foreign exchange, and foreign exchange assets, after my arrival in these places, I repeatedly persuaded and urged all sectors of society to participate more enthusiastically in the exchange and declaration. In Kunming alone, as of the most recent date, the value was approximately US$15 million. The cities of Chongqing and Chengdu also had similar amounts, which shows the people's enthusiasm for loving the country. As for prices, I emphasized in various places the sufficiency of the reserve for the new currency guarantee, the strictness of the limited amount of issuance, and the government's determination to stabilize the new currency and control prices, in order to eliminate the general public's past mentality of valuing goods over currency. I also instructed the responsible authorities to strengthen management and guide idle capital into the right track, while suppressing interest rates to reduce production costs and increase production. At the same time, I investigated and prohibited hoarding, cracked down on speculation, and dredged cargo transportation, focusing on the regulation of materials, so that various factors causing artificial price increases in the past have gradually been eliminated. At present, the general situation in society has a good phenomenon, and the bumper harvest in Sichuan Province this year is a major boost to stabilizing people's hearts and stabilizing prices.</p>

<h3>China Branch of ECA Announces Execution of Aid to China: Rice, Flour, Cotton, Industrial Parts, Petroleum; Approved Allocation of Over US$118,950,000</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to an announcement on the 3rd by the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), details of the progress in executing the US$275 million plan to aid the Chinese people's economy since the establishment of the branch are as follows:</p>
<p>A total of 105,000 tons of rice and flour have already arrived in China.</p>
<p>A total of 305,000 bales of cotton have already arrived in China or have been loaded for shipment.</p>
<p>An allocation of US$22,250,000 is planned for industrial parts.</p>
<p>An allocation of US$22,000,000 is planned for petroleum.</p>
<p>The total for the above items is US$118,950,000, including materials and supplies that require foreign exchange to purchase, thus enabling China to save on foreign exchange expenditures.</p>
<p>The ECA is deeply concerned about the utilization of materials and funds, and hopes to achieve maximum efficiency in utilizing resources, so as to make the greatest contribution to the economic recovery and self-help of the Chinese people. It also plans to take appropriate steps to avoid materials shipped to China from being left to rot in warehouses.</p>
<p>The above principles are being put into practice by the ECA in the following areas:</p>
<p>(1) Food: The ECA has so far spent US$20 million to purchase rice and flour, including 7,000 tons of rice shipped from Bangkok this week. All rice comes from Siam, while flour comes from the United States.</p>
<p>From July 1st of this year, the above-mentioned food will be used to supplement the Chinese government's grain reserves to maintain the rationing system in the six cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shantou. As of September 27th, the ECA has distributed a total of 71,645 long tons of rice. As of September 25th, the ECA has distributed a total of 10,150 long tons of flour. The remaining food that has already arrived in China is being distributed and rationed.</p>
<p>The ECA guarantees, through the rationing plan, that the food shipped to China is reasonably distributed to all citizens in the cities where it is rationed. At the same time, the ECA hopes to stabilize prices in the cities it assists. The ECA plans to supply 40% of the rationed rice by April 3rd of next year, with the remaining amount to be planned by the Chinese Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial Parts: An allocation of US$22,250,000 has been planned for parts to assist the following fourteen projects: Guangdong-Hankou Railway, Beijing-Tianjin Railway, Taiwan Railway, Yangtze Power Company, Kailuan Coal Mine, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, National Resources Commission's Central China and South China Power Plants, Jibei Power Plant, Chongqing Power Plant, Hankou Power Plant, Taiwan Power Company, Beijing, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and Qingdao Power Plants, and Customs Anti-Smuggling Work.</p>
<p>The above projects were selected after detailed inspections by the industrial investigation team led by Mr. Stuart of the ECA, and were approved after careful examination by the Chinese and American governments and industrial experts, in order to ensure that each project can enhance China's economic self-sufficiency and the welfare of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The parts plan includes materials worth hundreds of millions of dollars and large-scale economic installations. Its utilization requires a planned management system to ensure that everything is carried out according to scientific procedures. Therefore, a unique system has been created in the history of foreign aid programs to ensure the success of this plan.</p>
<p>Each parts plan must, with the consent of the ECA, employ an appropriate engineering company to complete the plan at the most economical cost and in the shortest possible time. The engineering company submits a service pledge to the ECA for the designated project, which must be countersigned by the executor of the application plan, guaranteeing that the plan is based on a thorough technical investigation and is expected to produce the expected results with the highest efficiency and at the lowest cost.</p>
<p>The pledge must be submitted to an advisory and supervisory engineering company appointed by the Chinese government for review. This advisory and supervisory engineering company is responsible for advising and supervising the joint committee for industrial construction and parts programs of the U.S. Aid Council and the ECA, and will discuss with the project engineers the methods of purchasing materials and other issues related to the various projects.</p>
<p>The purpose of the above procedures is to ensure that all plans are handled carefully by experienced experts.</p>
<p>(3) Petroleum: The ECA's plan aims to subsidize the continuous import of petroleum products to meet the essential needs of the Chinese people. If the source of these products is obstructed, China's industry and public utilities will be affected, which would suffocate the economic life of cities and surrounding villages.</p>
<p>The ECA has already paid US$22,000,000 for the first and second phases of petroleum allocations. This amount will be used to reimburse the Central Bank for the foreign exchange spent on subsidizing the import of 530,000 tons of petroleum between April 3rd and October 3rd of this year.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned US$22,000,000 includes the purchase of the following petroleum shipped to China (in metric tons):</p>
<p>Aviation Gasoline 23,842</p>
<p>Automotive Gasoline 44,868</p>
<p>Lubricating Oil 8,081</p>
<p>Engine Oil 590</p>
<p>Crude Oil 98,261</p>
<p>Kerosene 33,514</p>
<p>Fuel Oil 194,367</p>
<p>(4) Cotton: The 305,000 bales of cotton that the ECA has already shipped to China or loaded for shipment are worth a total of US$54,700,000. After twelve weeks of discussions between the ECA and the U.S. Aid Council, an agreement was reached on the method of distributing 70,000 bales of cotton to textile mills. Relevant parties deeply believe that the cotton shipped to China must benefit all the Chinese people and not be monopolized and profited from by any one part. Therefore, the U.S. Aid Council and the ECA strictly supervise every step of the process from the time the U.S. cotton leaves the warehouse until it is made into yarn and cloth and supplied to the final consumer.</p>
<p>The distribution of cotton is based on the total number of spindles in use in China. The recipient textile mills must meet the standards and methods of production stipulated by the Chinese government and approved by the ECA.</p>
<p>After extensive investigation of the manufacturing costs of various textile mills, the ECA has formulated a cotton-to-yarn/cloth ratio. Based on this ratio, the competent authorities will allocate sufficient raw cotton to the textile mills under reasonable profit conditions in exchange for the yarn or cloth produced. This exchange ratio is under strict review at all times and can be modified if necessary.</p>
<p>The distribution of cotton and the promotion of yarn and cloth at home and abroad are handled by the Joint Textile Management Committee. The ECA regularly sends representatives to the committee. All allocations of cotton, distribution of finished products, and revisions of exchange ratios must be approved by the ECA before implementation.</p>
<p>Currently, 50% of the finished products (yarn or cloth) are used for export to earn foreign exchange for purchasing raw cotton, while the remaining is for domestic consumption.</p>
<p>Under the tentative US$70 million cotton plan, the ECA will supply more than half of China's foreign cotton needs this year. This plan of the ECA is particularly important in assisting China's increased production and economic recovery.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Security Council's Discussion of the Berlin Incident, the Soviet Union Expresses Willingness to Reopen Negotiations; Marshal Sokolovsky Explains That Berlin is Not Actually Blockaded; Western Policy of Dividing Germany is the Main Cause of the "Crisis"</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 3rd - The Security Council will discuss the explosive Berlin issue when it meets on the 4th. At that time, representatives of all countries will brace themselves to face this serious trial. At the same time, the Political Committee will continue to deliberate on the issue of atomic energy, and the Economic Committee will begin to discuss the report of the Social and Economic Council. Therefore, next week will be one of the most tense and serious weeks of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 2nd] Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, declared on the 2nd that the Soviet government is prepared to continue negotiations on the Berlin incident in accordance with the agreement reached with the three Western powers in Moscow on August 30th. Sokolovsky said that the "actual resolution" depends entirely on whether the United States, Britain, and France are willing to resolve it. Sokolovsky outlined the Soviet Union's position on Berlin in a white paper of more than 10,000 words. Western authorities believe that this is the prelude to the Soviet Union's justification for the Berlin issue in the Security Council meeting on Monday. Sokolovsky denounced the Western countries' policy of "dividing Germany" as the culprit of the Berlin Cold War. He particularly denounced the currency reform of the Western Allies as the immediate cause of the "so-called Berlin crisis." Sokolovsky also stressed that there is actually no blockade of Berlin, but he again suggested supplying food and coal to the residents of West Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 2nd] Marshal Sokolovsky told editors of Soviet newspapers tonight: "The Western Allies are unwilling to have an agreement on the Berlin issue. They want to use the 'Berlin crisis' to divert the world's attention from their policy of dividing Germany." Sokolovsky continued: "If the Western Allies do not want Berlin to become an outpost for attacking socialism and democracy, the Berlin issue would have been resolved long ago. At present, Berlin has become a base for the Western Allies to attack the economic and political life of the Soviet zone. The Western Allies have attempted to undermine the currency system in Berlin and have taken various other aggressive measures. The decision of the three-nation conference in London in March to divide Germany is the real cause of the 'Berlin crisis.' The Western Allies' decision to establish a divided West German government is the direct cause of the breakdown of the Allied Control Council and a major blow to the Berlin four-power administrative structure. The unilateral currency reform in West Germany in June, and the subsequent attempt to make the West German mark legal tender in Berlin, immediately triggered the so-called 'Berlin crisis.'" Sokolovsky continued: The Western Allies insist that the Soviet Union should lift traffic restrictions between Berlin and West Germany, but they are unwilling to abide by the agreement reached in Moscow, namely that the restoration of traffic should proceed in parallel with the cessation of West German mark circulation in Berlin. Sokolovsky pointed out in particular that at the breakdown of the four-power commander-in-chief talks in Germany on September 7, the Soviet authorities suggested: (1) Lifting all restrictions on railway and highway traffic; (2) Sixteen trains per day between Helmstedt and Berlin, three of which for military use. Sokolovsky concluded: In fact, there is no so-called "blockade of Berlin." Berlin residents can obtain everything from the Soviet occupation zone, including coal for winter, but due to the opposition of the Berlin City Council controlled by the Western Allies, Berlin residents cannot obtain supplies from the East Zone. In the talk, Sokolovsky also pointed out that the breakdown of the four-power commander-in-chief talks on September 7 was due to the stubbornness of General Clay, the commander-in-chief of the US Army. Participants requested four days to draft a joint report to their respective governments, but Clay did not want such a report.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senior Military Authorities Plan a 50-Year National Defense Plan to Address Atomic Warfare with the Soviet Union as the Target</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. senior military authorities have recently drafted a 50-year national defense plan based on the belief that the Soviet Union will be able to produce atomic bombs in 1952 and complete intercontinental atomic rockets in 1977. The leaders of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff warned on the 2nd that they believe the defense needs of the atomic age will develop in three stages over the next 50 years. They will request Congress to appropriate $15 billion for the first phase of national defense for the 1950 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Three-Stage Implementation</p>
<p>The three stages are as follows: (1) The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff expect that the Soviet Union will not have atomic bombs before 1952. During this period, the United States can develop an overwhelming atomic superiority, but cannot compete with the Soviet Union's land forces. It is estimated that the Soviet Union has more than three million armed personnel. (2) From 1952 to 1977, this will be the most severe stage, when the Soviet Union and other countries may manufacture atomic weapons and long-range strategic air forces capable of bombing American cities. (3) After 1977, in this stage, the Joint Chiefs of Staff expect that intercontinental atomic rockets, gas clouds, death rays, and other amazing weapons will appear. Military leaders believe that civilization may be destroyed during this period. The current purpose of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff plan is twofold: First, to have sufficient military power ready for immediate mobilization to support U.S. diplomacy in negotiations with the Soviet Union. Second, to build armed forces for the second stage when the Soviet Union possesses atomic bombs.</p>
<h3>Zhang Pengchun's Speech Supports the Declaration of Human Rights</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Attacks it as Reactionary</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 2nd] Following Foreign Minister Wang's speech, Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun again delivered a speech in Chinese today. Zhang stated in the Third Committee this morning China's position on the draft Declaration of Human Rights. Zhang declared that China supports the draft Declaration of Human Rights in its current general form, but emphasized that this declaration should be a simple document for the general public, not a lengthy document for jurists. Zhang delivered this speech in fluent Mandarin and a scholarly tone.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The Soviet Union attacked the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights on the 3rd, denouncing it as "reactionary and oppressive." Poland and Belarus supported the Soviet Union. This declaration will be put to a vote at the current General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Many Obstacles to the Formation of a Group of Near and Middle Eastern Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 2nd] Persons close to the delegations of Egypt, Turkey and Greece replied to a question from a Central News Agency reporter, saying that the United Press report that 12 countries in the Near and Middle East (including Afghanistan, Egypt, Abyssinia, Greece, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and Yemen) are taking steps to establish an Eastern bloc within the framework of the United Nations is a great exaggeration. They also said that there are many obstacles to the establishment of such a bloc.</p>
<p>(1) The United Kingdom and the United States are the masterminds behind this bloc plan. Now the 12 countries concerned oppose the UK and US policy of partitioning the Holy Land, and the fierce opposition from the Arab side alone is an insurmountable obstacle. (2) The UK and US are eager to encourage the establishment of an Eastern bloc, intending to use the bloc as an anti-Soviet bastion in the Middle East to protect their oil interests at present, and to use it as a military ally in the future in times of war. However, well-informed Egyptian sources pointed out, "We do not intend to be tools for the UK and US oil interests, nor do we want to fight against the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>The Socialist Party Refuses to Support Hitoshi Ashida; the Fate of the Cabinet is Sealed; the Socialist Party Meeting Today Will Determine the Fate of the Government</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The changes in the Japanese political situation have shown a sharp turn in recent days. The second three-party meeting, which was decided at the previous three-party meeting to be held on the 4th, has now been cancelled. It will be replaced by a liaison meeting between cabinet ministers from the Socialist Party and party executives. The Socialist Party members in the cabinet, Kato and Nomizo, and the Socialist Party's Diet Affairs Committee Chairman, Saikubo, all insist on the resignation of the cabinet. Important executives of the Socialist Party said that even if the next regime falls into the hands of the extremely conservative Liberal Democratic Party, it will not be obvious. The Kurisu incident occurred in the Ashida cabinet, and there is no face to face the people of the country. It is expected that the resignation of the cabinet will be won in the liaison meeting on the 4th.</p>
<p>As for the timing of the resignation, it is generally predicted to be before the Socialist Party holds its Central Executive Committee meeting (to be held on the 7th). At present, Ashida and the Democratic Party are in an extremely difficult and passive position, and will not be able to change the political situation.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Japanese Democratic Party held an emergency executive meeting in the Diet building on the 2nd. Ashida and Inukai attended and exchanged views on how to deal with the political situation in the future. Most people still insisted on separating Kurisu's personal criminal behavior from the Democratic Party government's problem. They also strongly encouraged Ashida to continue to summon the courage to take responsibility for the government. However, it is rumored that Ashida's attitude seems to have become negative, but it is still too early to predict whether it is because he fears that Kurisu's criminal problem will be related to Ashida. In short, the power of the Socialist Party, the largest friendly party, is now unwilling to continue to support the Ashida cabinet, so its fate has been sealed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd] Today, all the editorials of Tokyo newspapers unanimously demanded Ashida's resignation.</p>

<h3>US and British Generals Approve the Enlistment of Spain into Joint Defense; US Military Committee Returns Home</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 2nd] Spanish officials today admitted that the talks between Franco and US Military Committee Chairman Clay here focused on the Spanish military potential. Spanish newspapers all carried long articles saying that US and British generals, including General Montgomery, all agree that Spain should join the Western European group. According to US military experts, the European defense line must be set along the Pyrenees (the mountain range between France and Spain). According to a newspaper close to the Spanish Foreign Ministry this morning, the US and British Army Staff are now distrustful of France, believing that France can never have great military strength to resist aggression.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 2nd] The committee inspecting US naval bases in Western Europe and the Middle East, led by Senator Clay, departed from here today and returned to Washington.</p>
<h3>The Siamese Government Suppresses a Coup; Fifty Military Officers Arrested</h3>
<p>Including Former Military District Commander and Arsenal Director</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 3rd] The Siamese government authorities here today cracked a conspiracy to overthrow the Phibunsongkhram government, and about 50 important figures in the Siamese military were arrested. Among the arrested military personnel were General Yookhsing, the former commander of the First Military District, and Sathantanon, the director of the Bangkok Arsenal. During the search, gunfire was exchanged around the Ministry of National Defense, but fortunately no one was injured. At the same time, the domestic situation is also calm. This incident seems to be limited to the military.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 3rd] Police authorities here arrested twenty civil and military officials on the night of the 2nd for launching a coup to overthrow the Phibunsongkhram government. The names of these arrested officials are kept extremely secret. It is reported that some of them were officials in the Phannarong cabinet that was overthrown in the November 1947 coup. One of the leaders of this conspiracy was Colonel Songglai, the captain of the Army Transportation Corps. Several other suspects have already escaped.</p>
<h3>Cabinet Reshuffle in Albania</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 3rd - Belgrade Radio: The Albanian radio station announced that the Albanian cabinet has been reshuffled and a new prime minister has been appointed. This change is considered a direct result of Albania's split with Marshal Tito. According to reports received in Belgrade in recent weeks, Albania has been described as being in crisis due to the dispute between the Communist Information Bureau and Tito.</p>
<h3>The Yugoslav Communist Party Publicly Criticizes the Soviet Union for Pressuring Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Forcing it to Take a Path That Does Not Suit the National Conditions</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 2nd] The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ began publishing documents today of mutual attacks between the Communist Information Bureau and the Yugoslav Communist Party. The newspaper said that the Hungarian and Romanian governments have begun to oppress the Yugoslav minorities in their respective countries, while the Yugoslav government will never discriminate against the Hungarian and Romanian minorities in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ accused the Soviet Union of deliberately underestimating the achievements of socialist construction in Yugoslavia, misinterpreting the nature of the Yugoslav revolution, and spreading accusations of Yugoslav nationalism. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ said, "In fact, they want to pressure Yugoslavia to take a path in its revolutionary process that does not suit Yugoslavia's national conditions, and want to make Yugoslavia take a step backward instead of moving forward." The newspaper denied that there was any similarity between the Tito incident and the Polish Gomulka incident. Gomulka was one of the leaders of the Polish Communist Party and was also accused of deviating from the Marxist line. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ concluded that the dispute between the Communist Information Bureau and the Yugoslav Communist Party was due to the Information Bureau's unwillingness to understand the true nature of the Yugoslav revolution.</p>

<p>[Another report] A spokesperson for the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office announced to Central News Agency reporters at 8 PM on the 3rd: (1) The Inspection Committee held a routine meeting at 10 AM on the 3rd. Concrete decisions regarding the general inspection of materials throughout the city have been made, and a full-scale rollout will commence in the coming days. In addition to rigorously enforcing inspections against hoarding and speculation within the city, similar inspections will be carried out in cities along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, starting immediately, to thwart attempts by unscrupulous merchants to evade material controls.</p>
<p>Assisting Private Yarn Factories in Resolving Current Difficulties</p>
<p>(2) Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Textile Industry Association, hosted a tea reception at 4 PM on the 3rd, inviting Supervisor Chiang Ching-kuo. Attendees included Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Rong Erren, Zhang Wenqian, Wu Kunsheng, Rong Hongsan, Liu Guojun, Dong Chunfang, Wang Zhuyi, and dozens of others. During the reception, Mr. Chiang listened to the opinions of each person and sincerely explained the government's determination to assist and support private yarn factories, vowing to do everything possible to resolve all current difficulties, such as raw material supply and yarn sales.</p>
<p>Merchants Unanimously Express Support for Price Control Policy</p>
<p>(3) Supervisor Chiang again summoned responsible persons from rice, cloth, oil, sugar, fresh meat, and other trade associations, including Wan Molin, Dong Jiufeng, and Zhang Chao, for talks at 6 PM on the 3rd on the third floor of the National Bank. According to reports from all parties, except for cotton yarn, which has sufficient inventory, there are 200,000 dan of oil, enough to supply the city for four months, and enough sugar to supply the city for three months. Regarding the issue of increasing rice supply, Supervisor Chiang announced that merchants transporting rice to Shanghai are permitted to purchase soap and cloth to take back after selling their rice in Shanghai. The yarn and cloth market will temporarily suspend trading, but yarn and cloth will still be supplied as usual to those who need it. Legitimate requests can be submitted by the various trade associations to the manufacturers for purchase. Mr. Chiang also declared that prices, except for those related to increased taxes, will remain unchanged according to the "August 19th" price limits. Shanghai has sufficient inventory to meet demand, and the price control policy will not be changed. Responsible persons from the various trade associations unanimously expressed their support for this policy on the spot.</p>
<h3>Prices of Thirty-Three Kinds of Domestic Cigarettes Approved; Cigarette and Paper Shops Throughout the City Reopen Today; Prices of Yizhong and Imported Cigarettes Being Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The new market and wholesale/retail prices of cigarettes after the tax increase were approved yesterday by the Social Bureau, based on adjusted proportions, for thirty-three kinds of domestic cigarettes, including Golden Mouse. The new prices are 90% to 120% higher than the original prices. All cigarette stores and paper shops throughout the city, which had been closed for two days, were notified by the association to reopen for business today and sell at the new prices. The prices of various brands of Yizhong cigarettes (White Tin Pack, Three Cannon Towers, Great Britain, Old Knife Qianmen, etc.) have not yet been approved because the company requested an increase in the factory price to adjust for foreign exchange differences. The prices of various foreign cigarettes (including canned and packaged cigarettes such as 555, 39, Morris, Old Gold, Lucky Strike, etc.) are also being submitted to the Economic Control Supervisor's Office for approval and have not yet been agreed upon, so valley cigarette stores are temporarily suspending sales.</p>
<p>Although yesterday was the Social Bureau's regular weekly holiday, the Economic Administration Department continued to work as usual. Deputy Section Chief Zhou Weixin of the Price Management Section summoned representatives from the Cigarette Industry Association and the Cigarette, Soap, Candle, and Match Business Association to deliberate on the new prices of cigarettes after the tax increase. The calculation principle is based on adding a 76% finished product tax and a 19% tobacco raw material tax to the August 19th price, plus a foreign exchange difference calculation. Except for White Horse and Horseshoe domestic cigarettes, whose new prices have not been approved because the manufacturers have not submitted reports, the new prices of the thirty-three approved domestic cigarettes are as follows: (All in Gold Yuan)</p>

<h3>Getting Drunk Not Easy; New Restaurant Wine Prices Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Sauce Wine Business Association submitted its proposed new wine prices, based on the adjusted proportions of goods, to the Social Bureau for approval. It is reported that the Social Bureau has approved the following: First-class sorghum wine at 54 cents per catty (August 19th price 32 cents), second-class at 48 cents per catty (original price 29 cents), and third-class at 44 cents per catty (original price 26 cents). Imitation wine is 24 cents per catty (original price 18 cents). Yellow wine is 22 cents per catty (original price 16 cents). Tianjin sorghum wine, special grade, is 1.02 yuan per catty (original price 76 cents), first grade is 88 cents per catty (original price 54 cents), and second grade is 74 cents per catty (original price 45 cents).</p>
<h3>Limited Gold Jewelry in Silver Shops; Transactions Cannot Proceed</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the new financial plan, the silver jewelry business has virtually come to a standstill because bars of silver cannot be melted down for processing. Apart from earning handling fees by exchanging old gold for new, most large and small businesses have limited reserves and rarely exchange gold jewelry for cash. As a result, those with cash are switching to purchasing diamonds and jewelry, causing a sharp rise in jewelry prices. According to insiders, to maintain storefront operations, larger silver shops such as Fang Jiuxia, Qiu Tiandou, and Yang Qinghe still sell dozens of wire rings weighing five to six fen each, at the price limit plus a handling fee, and they are all pure gold. The amount sold by each store depends on the amount received, but unless the authorities allow the melting of old gold jewelry, transactions in the industry cannot proceed.</p>
<h3>The Dead's Money and Wealth Are抢夺; Demand Exceeds Supply at All Tin Foil Shops; Increased Taxes Lead to Demands for Price Increases</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The city's Foil Business Association has submitted new prices, based on the adjusted tax rate proportions, to the Social Bureau due to the increase in commodity tax on tin foil. Before the Social Bureau approves the adjustments, all foil shops are still selling at the original prices. According to industry insiders, because cigarette stores have been closed recently, merchants from the surrounding countryside who come to Shanghai to purchase cigarettes are shifting their focus to tin foil and rushing to buy it, resulting in a shortage of production at foil factories. Some foil shops are already limiting purchases, restricting customers to one piece of paper foil or one box of folded paper ingots per person.</p>
<h3>Overview of Work at the Shanghai High Procuratorate; Over 10,000 Cases Handled in Three Years; No Defendants Released on Bail Have Escaped; Only 30-Odd Cases of Traitors Remain Unresolved</h3>
<p>A responsible person from the High Procuratorate gave reporters an overview of the work of the procuratorate since its establishment: The procuratorate was established in October 1945 and, as of the end of May this year, has handled a total of over 12,000 criminal cases, of which over 11,000 have been closed, averaging over 300 cases per month. Among these, 2,176 cases of traitors were received, of which 2,122 have been closed. As of the end of last month, only 30-odd cases remained to be investigated. The unresolved cases of traitors are currently being actively investigated by the responsible prosecutors to gather evidence, with the aim of completing the investigation within this year. The procuratorate is extremely cautious about prosecuting cases. Those for whom evidence is confirmed are prosecuted according to the law. Therefore, of the 1,753 defendants prosecuted by the procuratorate, only 109 have been declared innocent, accounting for 6% of the number of prosecutions. The detention of defendants is also determined according to the severity of their crimes. Those whose cases are not serious are not easily detained. Therefore, defendants have not been detained for some time. All those who are granted bail have their bail procedures handled by clerks dispatched by the procuratorate, to demonstrate seriousness. Miraculously, no defendants released on bail have escaped in the past three years. The procuratorate strives for speed in handling official documents. All routine documents are handled as soon as they arrive and are never backloged. The former French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Valléry, once personally visited the Chief Prosecutor of the procuratorate, Mr. Du Baoqi, to thank him because his official documents to the procuratorate were always replied to within 48 hours. As a sign of respect, he presented Chief Prosecutor Du with an honorary membership in the French General Association. It is reported that Mr. Du is the first judicial officer in China to receive this honor.</p>
<h3>The Psychology of Favoring Goods Over Currency Needs to Be Corrected; Unprecedented Frenzy of Panic Buying; Canvas Shops All Lower Their Iron Gates; Medicine Stores Issue Orders for Delivery Ten Days Later</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since the authorities implemented the price control policy, formal market transactions have become sparse, while retail stores are filled with customers, with limited space available. The reasons for this are nothing more than the loose monetary policy and the fact that citizens had accumulated astonishing amounts of US dollars and small gold bars in the past. After complying with the authorities' orders to exchange them for Gold Yuan, due to the deeply ingrained concept of favoring goods over currency over the past few years, the public regards the August 19th price limits as unprecedentedly low prices and are vying to purchase and store goods. Some items, such as medicines, wool yarn, meats, and fabrics, are becoming the target of scalpers and carting gangs due to either short supply or seasonal needs. Where there is profit, they flock like ducks to water. As a result, long snake-like lines of these individuals can be seen everywhere on the streets. Yesterday was Sunday, and the streets were even more lively. Passersby were carrying large and small packages, returning fully loaded. Most silk and cotton fabric shops had their iron gates tightly closed, posting signs saying "Sold out today, please come early tomorrow." Wool yarn shops switched to selling leather goods. Cigarette and foil shops have been closed for two days due to tax increases, and addicts are flocking to foreign goods stalls to purchase and smoke cigarettes from military ration boxes. The most prosperous businesses are department stores and shoe and hat shops, with employees sweating profusely and unable to keep up with demand. The most ridiculous situation is that of restaurants specializing in dim sum, which cannot even supply noodles after 9 AM. Furthermore, due to today being the first day of the lunar month, all medicinal wines, pills, and elixirs at the more famous Chinese medicine shops have been crowded and purchased completely. Some stores are even saying that they cannot produce enough and are issuing orders to customers, with delivery to be made ten days later. This kind of herding mentality and rush to buy has been around for a long time, but recently it has become even more rampant. This is certainly due to the prevailing psychology of the general public, but how to balance supply and demand to adapt to the unprecedented purchasing power of citizens requires careful consideration and prompt action by the economic control authorities.</p>
<h3>Pacification and Construction Team Holds Tea Party; Hosts Police Bureau Chiefs and District Heads</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Pacification and Construction Team held a tea party at the Lido Hotel yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, hosting district heads from various districts of the city and chiefs of various police bureaus to connect and exchange ideas. Over a hundred guests attended, including the Chief of the Police Bureau, Yu Shuping. The leader of the Pacification and Construction Team, Wang Sheng, first expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of the various districts and bureaus and said that the Pacification and Construction Team is assisting those in charge of grassroots politics in building a new Shanghai, and asked for their guidance. Then, the bureau chiefs and district heads spoke, praising the achievements of the Pacification and Construction Team's work and presenting various opinions. Some believed that more emphasis should be placed on propaganda to change the psychology of merchants and increase production to alleviate the recent shortage of goods. Others raised issues of work coordination, which should be properly addressed, or suggested that the Pacification and Construction Team should pay more attention to fundamental issues and not worry too much about minor details. Some felt that the "pacification" work had already achieved considerable results and that more efforts should be made in the "construction" aspect in the future. Chief Yu Shuping said that since the Pacification and Construction Team came to Shanghai, the Police Bureau has received assistance from many comrades in economic control work, resolving many difficulties. The working spirit of the Pacification and Construction Team members has also enhanced the enthusiasm of the Police Bureau personnel and improved discipline. He expressed hope for continued close cooperation. Leader Wang responded. The tea party ended at around 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Authorities Planning Methods; To Control Important Pharmaceuticals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Ministry of Health recently received a report from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau that Western pharmacies in the city have no stock of important medicines such as penicillin, and are investigating whether anyone is hoarding or manipulating prices. The Ministry is dispatching personnel to conduct a thorough inspection with the Police Bureau, and is drafting detailed methods to strictly control the sales of various important medicines. Director Zhang and others are planning to come to Beijing soon to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Investors Shifting Targets; Real Estate Industry Flourishing; Real Estate Industry Association Responds to "Ten Thousand Buildings" Movement; Raising Funds to Purchase Over Five Mu of Vacant Land on Dunxin Road to Build Houses</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] The August 19th currency reform has injected a shot of adrenaline into Shanghai's long-paralyzed real estate industry. From an objective perspective, market fluctuations in various industries have been reduced to a minimum under the weight of controls. However, speculative capital spilling over from the stock market and gold/US dollar exchange must find a home. As a result, real estate has once again become the darling of investors.</p>
<p>However, the real estate that is the darling of investors is still limited to the following two types: (1) vacant houses that can be lived in, and (2) vacant land on which houses can be built. It is estimated that real estate that meets these conditions accounts for only about one-fifth of the total real estate in the city. Supply is limited, and there are few sellers but many buyers, so it is no wonder that prices are rising higher and higher. Since August 19th, the rate of increase in prices of this type of real estate has reached a recent high of double, from an initial two or three percent. Apart from this type of real estate, other types, such as vacant land in factories or slum areas, and occupied lane houses and apartments, have not only not seen an increase in prices, but even transactions are rare.</p>
<p>Shanghai West is the Hottest, Prices Rising by 100%</p>
<p>According to conservative estimates, the recent rate of increase in land prices is highest in the Shanghai West district, with an average increase of 40% to 100%. For example, vacant land in the best section of Yuyuan Road in Shanghai West currently has a market price of about 80,000 yuan per mu, equivalent to forty large gold bars. Even slightly inferior land costs about 40,000 yuan per mu. The section of Daxi Road near Jing'an Temple costs 70,000 yuan per mu, and even further west it is cheaper, but the lowest price is close to 30,000 yuan per mu. Other areas such as Dunxin Road cost about 40,000 to 60,000 yuan per mu. It is said that even the vacant land on both sides of Jinji Road, the only way to Longhua Airport, is now selling for 30,000 yuan per mu.</p>
<p>The land prices in other districts, ranked according to the size of the increase, should be Hongkou District, Nanshi District, Zhabei District, and Shanghai East District. Although the rate of increase in these areas is not as fierce as in the Shanghai West District, the best land, depending on the quality of the location, has also increased by as much as 100%, and the worst has increased by at least 20%. As for the central area, houses have long been densely packed, and vacant land is as rare as phoenix feathers, making it the most difficult to find and the most expensive.</p>
<p>Building 10,000 Houses Within Six Months</p>
<p>With land prices increasing daily, transactions are naturally flourishing. According to Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau, before August 19th, the bureau handled less than ten real estate transfer cases per day. After August 19th, the number of transfer cases has increased daily, and recently the number of transfer cases per day has increased to more than twenty. Therefore, judging solely from the number of transfer cases at the Land Administration Bureau, the transaction volume of real estate after August 19th has increased by double. The most common transactions are for one or two mu of vacant land.</p>
<p>To cooperate with the emergency financial and economic measures, the Land Administration Bureau has recently implemented policies to encourage speculative capital to invest in real estate, especially in building houses. Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau has stated that the recently established Shanghai Municipal Housing Construction Promotion Committee has decided to promote a "Ten Thousand Buildings" movement within six months. This movement aims to complete the construction of 10,000 new houses in various districts of the city within six months. Various preferential treatments will be given to homeowners who build houses, such as: (1) exemption from land value tax for three years, and (2) exemption from house tax for one year. If houses are built within six months of purchasing land and sold within one year, they will be exempt from land appreciation tax. At the same time, the municipal government will do its best to provide various conveniences for the water and electricity facilities and transportation conditions of new houses. Recently, it is also planned to divide new residential areas in the five districts of Shanghai West, Nanshi, Zhabei, Shanghai East, and Pudong. Housing must be built in these residential areas within a specified period. If housing is not built within the specified period, a vacant land tax will be levied. This vacant land tax will be levied at three times the land value tax and will increase to ten times within a year and a half. This is a kind of pressure on landowners, forcing them to take the path of building new houses, which is also an aid in solving the city's housing shortage. Director Zhu expressed full confidence in completing this "Ten Thousand Buildings" movement.</p>
<p>New Organization of the Real Estate Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association is now taking the lead in responding to this "Ten Thousand Buildings" movement. The committee, collectively supported by the association's members, has now formed the first investment group, which has purchased over five and a half mu of vacant land on Dunxin Road, with a transaction price of approximately 200,000 yuan. This group plans to invest another 400,000 yuan in this piece of land, planning to build forty single-family houses or twenty double-family houses. The design of the houses is currently being studied and is expected to be completed within three months. This can be said to be the prelude to the entire movement, and it is hoped that investors will respond and help solve the city's housing shortage problem.</p>
<p>Judging from the current favorable objective environment, the real estate industry, which has been dormant for many years, will surely have a future of recovery. At best, the authorities only need to control housing rents related to people's livelihoods. In addition, the price of real estate itself, in a situation where the price of everything else is limited but real estate is not, will have sufficient room for activity, making it easier for real estate to become a target for speculative capital.</p>
<h3>Taiwan慰劳團 Attends Welcome Tea Party; Represents Taiwanese Compatriots in Expressing Hope for Pacification</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The six-member Taiwan Provincial慰劳團 has arrived in Shanghai. Various circles in the city held a tea party at the Shanghai Club yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome them. Zhang Fang, leader of the Central Plains慰劳團 who recently returned from慰劳troops in the Central Plains, and Deputy Leader Dui Renzhao, were also invited to attend to report on their experiences. The Taiwan慰劳團 included团长Huang Liandeng, Provincial Councilor; Deputy团长Huang Zhenqiu, Section Chief of the Department of Social Affairs;团员Chen Tianshun, Chairman of the General Labor Union; Li Junyao, Director of the Provincial Farmers Association; Xu Shixian, Standing Director of the Women's Association; and Qiu Zhangmei, Section Chief of the Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal参议会, the General Labor Union, and other units in the city also attended.</p>
<p>Bringing Donations; Sugar and Tea Abundant</p>
<p>First, Fang Zhi introduced the two sides. Then, 团长Huang delivered a speech, stating that Taiwan Province has been able to progress steadily in recent years thanks to the soldiers on the front lines pacifying the country. The 6.5 million compatriots in Taiwan Province, to express their respect for the loyal and brave soldiers, specially formed the慰劳團, bringing donations from all walks of life, including 300 boxes of white sugar, 40 boxes of black tea, 20 boxes of cigarettes, 4 boxes of cigars, and 100 brocade banners, intending to go to the Xu, Bian, Ping, and Fan areas to慰劳troops. He said that Taiwanese compatriots are eagerly hoping for the early success of pacification and wholeheartedly support the government's measures such as military grain requisition and currency reform. Rumors that Taiwanese compatriots are seeking trusteeship or independence are purely fabricated rumors. Taiwanese compatriots believe that this would insult their sincerity in striving to return to the motherland for nearly a century. He further said that he was greatly pleased to see that the extravagant situation in society had been greatly reduced since he came to Shanghai, and hoped that people on both sides of Taiwan and Shanghai would work together towards the goal of nation-building under the same living standards. Subsequently, Huang Zhenqiu, Chen Tianshun, and Li Junyao delivered speeches, stating that all circles in Taiwan Province are burying themselves in construction work, and that there have been good achievements in agriculture and industry since the restoration. They hoped to contribute to the pacification work and achieve victory as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao Talk about慰劳Troops Experience</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao reported on their experiences in慰劳troops in the Central Plains and put forward points to note in慰劳work: (1) Bring more medicines and medical supplies and donate them to wounded soldier hospitals. (2) Bring more books and magazines to enrich the lives of soldiers on the front lines with spiritual food. (3) Interact more with lower-level cadres and soldiers in various units. (4) Listen more to civilian reports to exchange opinions between the front and rear people. The Taiwan慰劳團 expressed its acceptance, and the meeting ended at 15:00.</p>
<p>慰劳團 Goes to Beijing</p>
<p>The慰劳團 has taken the night train to Beijing last night. After consulting with the Ministry of National Defense and the慰劳总会 to determine everything, they can start their journey. The entire itinerary is expected to take 45 days.</p>

Beside it were two elaborately dressed "young masters and young ladies," leaning on each other, reflecting strongly. Behind them were a large number of nylon silk fabrics, whiskey, etc., with the words "Why do we need these luxuries? They consume foreign exchange!" Finally, there was a large team of masquerading farmers, carrying farm implements, and raising slogans such as "The diligent and frugal masses unite! Organize!" and "Break down the inequality of life! Expose parasitic elements!" The procession passed through Carter Road, Tongfu Road, Linsen Middle Road, Jinling East Road, Zhengzhong East Road, Tibet Road, Nanjing East Road, and dispersed in front of the Bund Huangpu Park.</p>

<h3>Military Friends Association Reorganization Completed</h3>
<p>Emphasis on Cultural and Recreational Activities</p>
<p>Regarding various news reports about the Military Friends Association yesterday, the spokesperson of the association's committee clarified that the association is now jointly managed by people from all walks of life and various party, government, and military organs. It has expanded its foundation and fundamentally changed from a private business nature to serving military friends entirely. All operations emphasize military cultural and recreational activities. Currently, they are preparing for reading rooms, reading groups, music concerts, poetry clubs, calligraphy and painting clubs, literary clubs, lecture series, travel agencies, and group weddings. As for the restaurants, tea houses, and salons that were originally privately operated, they have been completely transformed to serve military personnel. The Chinese and Western cuisine tea house is managed by Wei Yingjing, the former director of the Chongqing Anti-Japanese Construction Hall, who also serves as the director of the association's recreation department. Rumors that the Oriental Hotel and Central Hotel have contracted the operations are absolutely untrue. The salon is managed by Kuniaki Kuko, a resident Japanese technician, and fully maintains an oriental atmosphere. As for the association's working policy, it intends to focus on the "Diligent and Frugal Nation-Building Movement," striving to achieve "civilian life in the rear and soldier life at the front." The grand opening will be on Double Tenth Day, presided over by Director Fang himself.</p>
<h3>Argument Over Silver Dollar Transaction Leads to Manslaughter Sentence</h3>

Liu immediately fell to the ground unconscious and was taken to China-America Hospital, where he died. Liu's wife, Ms. Hu, filed a lawsuit, which was investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutor. The District Court sentenced Ji Yingju to five years of imprisonment for manslaughter.</p>

<h3>Gunshots at Dusk in the Southern City: Bandit Attempts to Resist Arrest, Shot in the Back</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Penglai Police Precinct in the southern city received a tip-off yesterday at dusk that two bandits were planning to rob a certain store in Zhongshipi Lane in the city at night, and were currently having tea at Xinglong Tea Garden at the intersection of Lujiabang Road and Daxing Street in the southern city. Precinct Chief Wu immediately ordered the Criminal Division to investigate and apprehend them. Division Chief Li Dazhi personally led officers Lu Jifeng, Li Xianwen, Bian Xicheng, Li Fengyong, Chen Hailin, and others to the tea garden. Unexpectedly, the bandits spotted the police officers arriving and immediately tried to escape. Officer Lu gave chase and captured one bandit, Shi Jinshan (from Chongming, 31 years old, residing at 182 Qufu Road), on the spot. The other bandit fled to Dadian Street and was about to turn into the intersection of Jiangyin Street when the police officers caught up. At a distance of about twenty feet, they shouted for him to stop. The bandit ignored the warning and reached into his pocket for a Browning pistol, preparing to turn around and fire to resist arrest. Officer Bian Xicheng, seeing this, immediately opened fire, hitting the bandit in the back. The bullet went through his stomach and exited through the front. He staggered a few steps before falling to the ground, spitting blood from his mouth, barely breathing. He dropped the gun he was holding (with five bullets inside) on the side of the road. He was rushed to the police hospital. Upon checking his ID, he was identified as Shen Weixin, 31 years old, from Chongming, residing in Xuejiaku, Zhenru. It was discovered that his real name was actually Yang Ximeng, a former cook who had committed numerous thefts in his hometown of Leming and was wanted by the police.</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Municipal Government is organizing resettlement teams to relocate to Jiangxi to cultivate wasteland to provide relief for refugees who have fled to Shanghai. This plan has now reached the implementation stage. The Shanghai Relief Committee originally planned to resettle 5,000 families in the first phase, with each family consisting of four people, totaling 20,000 people. After discussions with the Jiangxi Provincial Government, they will first send 3,500 people. The Relief Committee has prepared a budget, including building sheds after arriving at the destination, purchasing farm cattle, furniture, tools, and six months' worth of staple and non-staple food, totaling 180,420 gold yuan. After six months, the sweet potatoes and other crops they plant will be able to support themselves. The Relief Committee is currently raising funds for this project and will soon send personnel to Jiangxi to prepare everything. After returning to Shanghai, they will begin processing registration and sending people off.</p>
<p>Capacity for 70,000 Refugees</p>
<p>According to investigations, there are currently as many as 788,900 acres of wasteland in Jiangxi Province. Assuming that each person cultivates ten acres, it may be possible to accommodate 70,000 refugees. The first batch of 3,500 people is scheduled to be allocated to the following reclamation sites: Dexing 200 people, Dean 100 people, Yongxiu 500 people, Zixi 100 people, Lichuan 100 people, Chongren 100 people, Lean 200 people, Jikoushui 300 people, Anfu 1,100 people, Taihe 300 people, Wan'an 200 people, Nanfeng 100 people, Guangchang 200 people.</p>
<p>Universal Survey Implemented</p>
<p>Because resettlement in Jiangxi is one of the main decisions of the city's relief efforts, in order to prevent a small number of professional refugees from attempting to stay in Shanghai and live a life of dependency, a universal survey will be conducted on refugees who do not participate. All (1) those who have been certified by a doctor to be physically and mentally healthy and capable of working, (2) those who have engaged in agriculture for more than three years and have been certified, and (3) those who are between the ages of sixteen and forty-five without special or obvious symptoms of illness, should participate in the resettlement. Otherwise, they will be sent back to their hometowns within a specified period.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Entire Caobin Road</h3>
<p>Northern Section of Construction Completed</p>
<p>Caobao Road, a major road in the western suburbs, starts from the Shanghai-Minhang Highway in the east and connects to Hongqiao Road and Qinghu Road in the north, serving as a major communication line for Caohejing and Qibao towns in the suburbs. In recent years, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has carried out phased construction. The entire road's bridges and the section from the Shanghai-Minhang Highway to Qibao Town have been renovated and completed, allowing for smooth traffic. However, the northern section from Qitou Town to the Hongqiao-Qinghu Road section has not yet been completed, causing inconvenience for vehicles traveling north. Last year, the bureau prepared a budget and planned for construction, which was only approved this year. At that time, due to a large discrepancy in the budget, the project almost came to a halt. However, thanks to the efforts of the bureau in charge, they managed to cut costs, reduce standards slightly, and utilize mechanical road construction, eventually achieving completion. That section of the project was completed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>

<p>Weekly Economy</p>
<h3>General Prices: Prices Recover from Weakness, Most Rise to Limit</h3>
<p>Approximately forty days have passed since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. The deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people was originally set for the end of September, which could have been considered a conclusion, but it has now been extended by another month to the end of October. Looking at the situation in the month or so since the implementation of the new economic plan, there are still many areas that urgently need improvement. Generally speaking:</p>
<p>(1) It is estimated that the amount of idle capital in Shanghai currently exceeds 400 million yuan. It is also reported that the method of remitting funds from the Northeast to the interior has been abolished, and it is expected that a large amount of capital will flow to Tianjin and Beijing, and then to Shanghai. The authorities have not been able to effectively channel idle capital, which remains a major threat to the plan.</p>
<p>(2) Since the implementation of price controls, because of the rigid regulations, the relationship between some finished products and raw materials has not been reasonably adjusted, which has a significant impact on increasing production. At the same time, due to the different price levels between this port and other ports, goods from this port are attempting to escape abroad, while raw materials and local products from other ports are unwilling to come in.</p>
<p>(3) The authorities seem to be very slow in managing and utilizing the assets of Chinese people abroad, while being very active in implementing the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency from the people at home. In contrast, not only does the handling appear unfair, but also in today's urgent need for foreign exchange, the government's relaxation of this aspect gives people a sense of putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>The trend of market prices last week initially showed weakness due to the authorities' control and the holding of a general registration of materials, causing public anxiety. However, prices quickly rebounded and mostly reached the price increase limit. Some goods even experienced a shutdown or semi-shutdown state.</p>
<p>In the cotton yarn market, Blue Phoenix yarn still had no trading activity. 21-count Double Horse yarn initially saw a low price of 760 yuan due to the registration of inventory, but from Tuesday to Friday, it stood firmly at 783 yuan. 관頭细布 experienced more fluctuations, with a low of 26.4 yuan on Monday and Tuesday and a high of 28 yuan on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the grain market, the price of rice increased due to rising prices in the producing areas, creating a reverse price phenomenon. Sources were scarce, and high-end goods disappeared from the market. The market prices for white rice in both the North and South markets remained at 20.78 yuan and 20.9 yuan. The flour market was completely stagnant, and only a small number of miscellaneous grains were traded, with many entering a semi-stagnant state. The edible oil market was strong, with the price of Qingdao Jisheng oil remaining unchanged at 59.9 yuan throughout the week. The trend of daily necessities also showed some positive signs. On Friday, Gu Ben soap stood at 26.8 yuan, an increase of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous weekend's 25.6 yuan. Beautiful matches stood at 119 yuan on the weekend, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous weekend's 117 yuan. Due to the scarcity of deliveries, cigarettes were in short supply, and more miscellaneous brands were seen on the market.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen economic control, the Executive Yuan meeting decided to expand the scope of the established Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and three supervisory areas, and add one more area in Central China. The areas are as follows: (1) Shanghai area: Shanghai, Nanjing, and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; (2) Guangzhou area: Guangzhou and the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian; (3) Tianjin and Beijing area: Tianjin, Beijing, and Qingdao, and the provinces of Hebei and Shandong; (4) Hankou area: Hankou, Chongqing, and the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi. Regarding strengthening economic control, controlling materials, and holding comprehensive distribution matters, President Weng convened relevant officials for a discussion to exchange opinions. It was believed that the situation in various regions was very good, but there were still the following phenomena:</p>
<p>(1) The strict implementation of economic control in Shanghai has caused the prices of some important industrial raw materials in Shanghai to be lower than those in the producing areas, which has led to a tendency to cut off sources of supply, which has a significant impact on production. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the implementation of economic control comprehensively in the major regions.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the different levels of various price limits set on August 19 in the major regions of the country, some exceeded the reasonable prices at that time, while others were not enough to maintain costs. Both will be adjusted according to their actual situation to achieve balance and avoid the escape of materials.</p>
<p>(3) Although the people in various regions are very fond of the new currency, the increase in bank deposits has not reached the ideal level. In order to strengthen people's confidence in the gold yuan, the issuance of gold yuan should be particularly tightened, and the past measures of issuing to make up for deficits should be eradicated. Regarding the control of materials and distribution issues, it was believed that the supply side should formulate methods to strengthen the control of materials by the Economic Management Committee, and the government should purchase from the producing areas. On the distribution side, the non-comprehensive distribution system should continue to be implemented, and major daily necessities for the people should be rationally distributed in major cities. However, the purchase of materials should be done by region and at appropriate prices, without stimulating prices in the producing areas. At the same time, loan policies should be coordinated to encourage merchants to purchase, so that the source of materials is sufficient.</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Economic Management Authority's general material registration, it ended at 6 PM on September 29. The types and quantities of registered items announced are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Edible Oil Business Association has 484 members who registered a total of 101,357 市担 (shi dan, a unit of weight) of soybean oil, raw oil, rapeseed oil, cooked raw oil, sesame oil, green oil, and ordinary oil, with each 市担 weighing fourteen catties.</p>
<p>(2) The Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association has 319 members who registered a total of 83,837 bags of soybeans.</p>
<p>(3) Over 2,180 boxes of artificial silk, over 800 dan of raw silk, and over 420 pieces of various cotton yarn and threads.</p>
<p>(4) The state-owned textile construction companies belonging to the Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai registered over 220,000 shi dan of cotton, over 1.25 million pounds of wool, over 1.5 million bolts of various cotton cloths, and over 14,000 pieces of cotton yarn, excluding semi-finished products. The amount of cotton yarn and cloth stored by private yarn factories belonging to the association in Shanghai was not announced.</p>
<p>(5) As of September 29, the Cotton Cloth Business Association had received 1,482 registration forms from its members, totaling 1,465,267 bolts of cotton cloth, 521,083 sections, 175,508 yards, 2,402 meters, 16,162 pounds, and 839 bed sheets, equivalent to approximately 2 million bolts.</p>
<p>Following the general material registration, a general material inspection was initiated. The inspection method was divided into 32 districts according to the Shanghai police district division. The items decided for general inspection were rice, edible oil, flour, cloth, yarn, paper, wax, and cotton, coal, and motor oil (referring to gasoline and diesel) among industrial raw materials. The inspection date was originally scheduled for three days, but it has now been decided to shorten it as much as possible, possibly completing it within two days. The authorities previously permitted passengers to carry contraband, but due to the activity of single smugglers and the organized transport of contraband out of the country, causing significant losses of materials, it was decided to temporarily suspend the application of that regulation.</p>
<p>According to the Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People, the deadline for the redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currency was originally set for September 30. It has now been decided by the Executive Yuan to extend the redemption of gold and foreign currency to the end of October, and the extension of silver, silver dollars, and silver coins to the end of November. Before the announcement of the extension of the exchange last week, the people were extremely enthusiastic about exchanging gold and banknotes. The national banks exchanged over 20 million to 32 million yuan of gold yuan every day. According to statistics, in Shanghai alone, from August 23 to September 30, the amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency exchanged totaled 372,482,715.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance: Loose Monetary Policy Continued to Intensify Last Week, Sharp Increase in Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exchange Leading to Outflow of Gold Yuan, Overabundance of Notes Inside and Outside the Industry, Difficult to Float Short-Term Funds</h3>
<p>The loose monetary policy in Shanghai continued to intensify last week. Before the currency reform, the monetary policy still showed a cyclical pattern of alternating looseness and tightness. However, after the reform, the supply and demand of funds became unbalanced. The supply came continuously, but the demand hesitated to move forward. As a result, the excess of idle capital has been accumulating day by day. The factors that determined the continued loose monetary policy last week include the following:</p>
<p>(1) The deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency was approaching the end of September. The general public was still unaware that the authorities had decided to extend the original deadline for another month. As a result, the number of exchangers greatly increased, and the supply of gold yuan added another strong force.</p>
<p>(2) Although national banks and bureaus received payments such as sugar tax during the week, they also had large expenditures for purchasing materials. As a result, the clearing of notes was still in deficit every day. By Friday of last week, the banks and bureaus had been in deficit for 20 consecutive days. The total deficit has reached more than 40 million gold yuan. Such a long period of deficit is a first since the victory. Of course, it has played a significant role in supplying funds to the market.</p>
<p>(3) The war in the north became more intense, and idle capital flowed south again. On Monday, the authorities decided to cancel the quota limit for remittances from the Northeast. Naturally, under the principle of safety first, the amount of remittances from the north to Shanghai can be imagined.</p>
<p>(4) As September ended and October began, various industries needed cash for expenses such as paying salaries. Also, due to the convenience of carrying gold yuan, the flow of cash southward has been very strong in recent days. However, due to the ample reserves of chips in Shanghai, there has been no sign of shortage.</p>
<p>(5) Since the previous week, the number of short-term treasury bills sold has been quite considerable, totaling more than 50 million yuan. However, compared to the 400 to 500 million yuan or more of idle capital in Shanghai, it is like a small witch seeing a big witch. Only a little more than one-tenth of the chips could be recovered. The effect on tightening the monetary policy was minimal.</p>
<p>(6) On Monday of last week, the Yida Chang Money Shop in Shanghai was ordered to suspend business. On Wednesday, the Shanghai branch of the Yunnan Mining Bank also voluntarily closed down and withdrew from the note clearing house due to sluggish business. It is not difficult to speculate that as a result of strengthening financial controls, the demand for funds has been hesitant to move forward, which has blocked part of the path for idle capital. The long-term loose monetary policy is inevitably related to this.</p>
<p>Since some of the reasons for the loose monetary policy could not be fundamentally eliminated, idle capital formed an undercurrent and drilled through any gaps. Interest rates fell frequently, and note holders often had difficulty floating short-term funds. The officially posted interest rates for money shops last week were lowered again on Friday (October 1st). The deposit interest rate was 1.5% (originally 1.8%), the loan interest rate was 4.8% (originally 5.7%), and the interbank lending rate was 3% (originally 3.9%). The hidden interest rates last week were generally between 4.5% and 6%, with the lowest even reaching 3%, generally falling below the official interest rates of money shops. However, longer-term lending had higher monthly interest rates, such as 1.5 角 (jiao, a unit of currency) for half a month and 1.8 角 for more than a month. This also reflects the general view of the financial future, which is not optimistic. The discount interest rates for cargo groups also continued to decrease, generally at 2 yuan per day. On Wednesday, it even dropped to 1 yuan at one point, equivalent to only 3% interest.</p>
<p>National banks and bureaus continued to experience successive deficits last week. From Monday to Friday, the total deficit was 10.93 million yuan, a decrease of only over 200,000 yuan compared to the same period in the previous week.</p>
<p>The clearing results of foreign banks varied from day to day, with deficits and surpluses. While there were deficits on Wednesday and Friday, there were surpluses on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. However, the total for the five days was a surplus of 2.39 million yuan, a decrease of 1.69 million yuan compared to the same period in the previous week.</p>
<p>Commercial banks and money shops continued to have ample funds last week, with overabundance of notes being widespread. Interbank lending came to a halt. The clearing results of commercial banks and money shops after number 60 in Shanghai from Monday to Friday totaled a surplus of 6.16 million yuan, but this included a deficit of 170,000 yuan from the Taiwan Bank during the same period. Therefore, the actual indirect clearing of commercial banks and money shops should be a surplus of 6.33 million yuan, an increase of over 1.7 million yuan compared to the same period in the previous week.</p>
<p>As for the inland exchange rates of commercial banks last week, there was not much fluctuation. The Guangzhou exchange rate remained at 24 yuan, the Xiamen exchange rate at 20 yuan, the Hankou exchange rate at 10 yuan, the Chongqing exchange rate was 10 yuan on Monday and increased by 2 yuan to 12 yuan on Wednesday, the Kunming exchange rate was 12 yuan, and the Tianjin exchange rate was 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Hong Kong gold market fluctuated slightly. On Monday, the price of gold per tael (a unit of weight) was 308.75 Hong Kong dollars. It suddenly rose to 315.5 Hong Kong dollars on Tuesday. On Wednesday and Thursday, it fell back to 309.5 Hong Kong dollars. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong showed a downward trend. It was 5.23 Hong Kong dollars on Monday and Tuesday, and then shrank to 5.19 Hong Kong dollars on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<h3>New York Exhibition of Modern Chinese Painting: Introducing the Excellent Traditions and Creative Spirit of Our Nation, Opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>[News from New York via Airmail] The exhibition of modern Chinese painting, after six months of preparation, will open at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York this Double Tenth Day. This international art exhibition will be held for two consecutive months. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the most famous and first-class art museum in the United States, with a rich and exquisite collection of Eastern and European art works, comparable to the Louvre Museum in Paris and the British Museum in London. This Chinese painting exhibition held in the museum will surely cause a sensation in the United States and attract the attention of people from all walks of life, which is expected.</p>
<p>According to reports, in January of this year, the painter Wang Yachen was ordered by the Ministry of Education to go to the United States to investigate art education, and was entrusted by Zhang Daofan, the chairman of the International Cultural Cooperation Association, and Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the Chinese Cultural Relics Research Association, to bring more than 120 paintings by modern Chinese masters. Thirty-two units, including Chinese art schools and associations, participated in the exhibition. A pre-exhibition review was held in Shanghai. At that time, the principle was to "rather be short of good quality than to accept bad quality" and to strive for perfection.</p>
<p>After arriving in the United States, with the assistance of Ambassador Gu Weijun, Consul Zhang Pingqun in New York, and Alan Priest, the director of the Eastern Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a preparatory committee for the exhibition was established, and the pieces were reviewed again. Alan Priest proposed to the museum's board of directors and was approved, deciding to hold a public exhibition on our country's National Day this year.</p>
<p>All the cataloging of the exhibited paintings, the selection and printing of target illustrations, and the exquisite printing design of the entire catalog were all presided over by Alan Priest, and the expenses were also borne by the museum. The exhibition catalog also has prefaces by Ambassador Gu, Lin Yutang, and Alan Priest.</p>
<p>Recently, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan Chen Lifu visited the United States and provided detailed guidance, stressing that this exhibition must represent the entire landscape of modern Chinese painting and be able to express the excellent traditions and creative spirit of our nation.</p>
<p>It has recently been decided to hold a pre-exhibition on October 8, and 4,000 invitations have been sent to invite people from all walks of life in New York and its surrounding cities to visit. Ambassador Gu and Consul General Zhang will preside over the opening ceremony. (Wang Yaqian)</p>

<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>I once read a book called "Alarmist Words in a Prosperous Age." The original author was a Taotai (circuit intendant) who advocated saving the country through industry. This work was written after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, when China's paper tiger had long been exposed. As a result, new slogans were shouted particularly loudly, and this author was naturally one who "arose in response to the times." As for his motivation for writing, whether it was purely out of love for the motherland or contained a sense of opportunism, I am not prepared to explore it further here. However, some of the plans he advocated may seem like clichés now, but at the time they were quite "relevant to the times." What particularly caught my attention was the title "Alarmist Words in a Prosperous Age."</p>
<p>To call China after the Sino-Japanese War a "prosperous age" was, of course, a scholar's cleverness, but in an autocratic era, one had to be so "opportunistic." While the source of "alarmist words" seems to come from the idiom "be mindful of danger in times of peace," with the meaning of preventing crises and consolidating the "prosperous age," the fact that "alarmist words" could actually arise in a "prosperous age" where everyone thought they were "safe" suggests that the author was somewhat worthy of pride, and the autocracy of the dying Qing dynasty was somewhat naively endearing.</p>
<p>Taking the current situation, after the War of Resistance against Japan, there was the suppression of bandits, with flames of war raging and refugees scattered everywhere. On the international front, there was both the Cold War and hot wars. Even if we could close ourselves off, it would not be enough to call it a "prosperous age," which cannot be denied. However, what about our "alarmist words"?</p>
<p>Summarizing the books and newspapers I can see (of course, for economic and time reasons, I see very little), they are nothing more than:</p>
<p>(1) Blindly praising and singing praises; (2) Slanderous abuse with ulterior motives; (3) Cold cynicism disguised as humor; (4) Fruitless messing around with antiques; these are still the better ones. In addition, things like women's legs, the daily lives of singers or stars, and the sensationalism of yellow journalism fill the pages of some publications.</p>
<p>In the autocratic era, there were still "alarmist words," but we are fortunate to be born in today's democratic era, where there are only nice-sounding words, poisonous words, boring words, and nauseating words. This is a cruel contrast. One fears danger even in times of peace, but we, in a situation as precarious as a pile of eggs, are still leisurely and self-satisfied. What a shameful numbness this is!</p>
<p>Of course, crying all day long or shouting from the sofa cannot save the precarious situation. Even the soldiers suppressing bandits on the front lines need to rest and have fun, right? However, it is most important not to abandon one's own work. Given the current situation, is the primary work of cultural figures who occupy leading positions in society today to blindly praise and be echo chambers, to spread rumors and abuse, to dig up old corpses, or to be intoxicated by the cherry lips of singers and women's legs?</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun seems to have given a speech in Hong Kong called "The Silent China." This is still a powerful lesson today because what he hoped for was not the chaotic and boring sounds mentioned above, but the true voice of the people. We now truly need the true voice of the people!</p>
<p>"Alarmist words" is not a pleasant term, but the effect of "alarmist words" can promote the realization of a "prosperous age." The meaning of "honest advice is unpleasant to the ear" lies here, not there.</p>
<h3>Strange Will</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>A bizarre Englishman instructed his family in his will to bury him properly in a solid mausoleum. The reason was that he did not want his relatives to eat him. His reasoning was: "The worms in the soil will eat me first, then the ducks will eat the worms, and then my relatives will eat the ducks."</p>
<h3>"Dining Late Is Like Eating Meat"</h3>
<p>— Shou Niu</p>
<p>Since the price controls of August 19th, pork has become almost extinct in the vegetable market, and beef is also difficult to buy. Nowadays, it is not easy to eat meat, and one cannot help but think of the ancients' saying "dining late is like eating meat." At first glance, this method is indeed very clever, but upon closer inspection and trying it out, it will make you laugh or cry. Eating after starving for half a day, even without meat, you will naturally feel that it tastes better than usual, even with meat. Leaving aside the many physiological issues, let's first say that this sentence came from a high-ranking official—"walking slowly is like riding a carriage, dining late is like eating meat." For a senior official to live so frugally, in today's Chinese situation, cannot be considered bad, but the problem is that since he does not ride in a carriage or eat meat, why does he still harbor the idea of eating meat as the highest standard? It can be seen that he still wants to eat. This is like saying that I don't dislike eating meat, but I just don't eat it, and then I come up with such a clever method to prove it to the emperor. There is a bit of flattery in this, as well as a bit of Ah Q spirit, and unknowingly, he reveals his true colors. If you don't eat meat, why not simply advocate vegetarianism—why "like eating meat"? If this gentleman were born now and became some kind of committee member promoting frugality, he would definitely show off his skills and might even come up with some even more ridiculous tricks.</p>
<p>Confucius seemed to pay much attention to nutrition. He thought it was good to eat meat, so he sang loudly, "At seventy, one is not satisfied without meat," without any embarrassment. But when he himself "did not know the taste of meat for three months," he grumbled endlessly and complained loudly. This lack of shame, genuine honesty, is rather endearing.</p>
<h3>Following and Responding to Inspector Yao's Poem Sent by the Hatchling</h3>
<p>— San Mu</p>
<p>Life is not a hundred years, and fullness is just halfway. Alas, this thunderbolt hand, old and still holding a bald pen. Will it not flatter the world, can it be said to be self-pleasing? Intoxicated, he laughs at gain and loss, the bright moon shines on my wrist. Marquis Yao is now a public figure, thinking of his loose collar and hair, sending new poems from afar, with stirring words for mutual sighing. We guard our poor bones, willing to change with human affairs? Going out and laughing to the west, the jingling tassels are so brilliant. Originally not a midday golden pearl, why use green to forge? The end of the world is worth , the autumn air is even more faint. Killing all over the nine lands, groups have bitter escapes. The many men of our time are empty and fragmented, and I myself am true, covering my ears and bidding farewell to order, and I will forget Wei and Jin in a drunken state, what other Han can I have!</p>
<h3>A Trace of Smoke</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>Throughout the year, I only buy two things: cigarettes and books. Therefore, I don't ask or hear about rice prices or firewood prices, but I do know about cigarette prices. When prices fluctuate, I often say that my life will be shortened by a few years due to the rising cigarette prices. The price is secondary, for example, if Qianmen brand cigarettes cost several million per pack, as long as the price doesn't fluctuate for a year or so, those who want to eat them can buy them, and those who don't want to buy them can leave. What's frightening is that morning and evening prices are different. At 10:00 AM, a pack costs a million, and at 3:00 PM, it costs 1.25 million, giving you a sense of anxiety sooner or later, which I think can shorten my life. Now it's good, some cigarettes have a fixed price, the same last month, the same this month, and the same next month. If I have three jinyuan in my pocket, I can get a pack of Qianmen at any time, and I'm at peace of mind, which will definitely prolong my life.</p>
<p>However, I heard that better cigarettes or popular cigarettes are not easy to buy. I have not experienced this myself, but only know it indirectly. Originally, I bought five packs of Qianmen today and casually asked the clerk, "Is it moldy?" Who knew that a customer buying four cartons of a certain cigarette laughed and said, "It's hard to buy, and you still ask if it's moldy." I also laughed and said, "Do you mean that it's okay if the cigarettes that are hard to buy are moldy?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Then do you want my moldy cigarettes?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I want as many as you have."</p>
<p>Another clerk inside also laughed and said to me, "You're buying them to smoke, so you have to ask if they're moldy. He's buying them to do business, so he only cares if there are goods, not if they're moldy."</p>
<p>Oh, so that's how it is. I don't want to blame this cigarette trafficker for his immorality, knowing that he earns money without caring about the health of his customers, because I know that the dignified Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan also supplies the people with a large number of moldy cigarettes and has earned a reputation for virtuous governance. I only blame my own confusion: I still discuss good or bad in the autumn of scarcity.</p>
<p>But this is not only true of me personally, but probably also true of the 400 million compatriots. Everyone is hoping for and welcoming stable prices, but complaints are also everywhere: Parker 51 fountain pens are no longer available, only roosters are available for sale, and if you go a little late, there are none left, etc. These complaints are human nature, but there is one thing that everyone doesn't think about much, and that is that in extraordinary times, if you want stable prices, goods must be scarce. If you want to buy cheap things in extraordinary times and have everything available, it is practically impossible. Why? The reason is very simple: we are a country that relies solely on foreign goods, single gangs, or smuggling to have all the beauty and perfection. Now that prices cannot be raised arbitrarily, there is no profit to be made, so all the single gangs, import businesses, and smuggling tycoons are changing industries one by one, and all goods are becoming scarce. Hiding good things and not selling them is secondary, and those who hide them will eventually suffer losses. I tell friends who do pen business: the most popular Parker in the United States is no longer the 51, but the 102.</p>
<p>There are countries in the world where things are cheap and everything is available, but the Chinese have to think about it, who told you that you can't make a 102 fountain pen yourself?</p>
<h3>Letter to American Congressmen</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>American congressmen constantly receive letters from all kinds of people. Besides the serious ones, these letters also have no lack of interesting ones. Now I extract and translate several to share with the readers of this publication. (The names of the recipients and senders have been omitted.)</p>
<p>I know that you have the privilege of sending letters for free.</p>
<p>I am now sending you all my New Year's cards, please send them for me, how about that?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I voted for you three times, I think you are admirable. Please send me nine hundred dollars immediately so I can buy a refrigerator and repaint my car.</p>
<p>P.S.: I voted for you three times in the 1946 election.</p>
<p>All my friends collect photos of movie stars, but I want to be different, so please send me photos of twelve congressmen. Please choose carefully, with the best funny faces.</p>
<p>Please do something for my house - my roof is leaking.</p>
<p>When there was a storm last night, I was eating dinner, the roof leaked so badly that my soup overflowed three times.</p>
<p>Please introduce a bill, or give a speech, or do something. If this continues, I really won't be able to remember who you are.</p>
<h3>Identifying Jewelry</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>This newspaper reports that diamond lottery tickets are about to be issued, and experts have identified and evaluated the prices of the confiscated property in detail. A friend occasionally mentioned that it is not easy to identify treasures. Mr. Wang, who was present at the time, said that assessing the value is definitely not something that those who are not familiar with market conditions can do. If it is only to distinguish between true and false, it is still simple, so he described the method of identification. Mr. Wang is experienced in the pawnshop business, so his words may not be wrong. A brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>Gemstones: Dip a bamboo strip in water and put it on the gemstone. If the water floats on top and spreads out and flows unevenly, it is fake. If it does not spread and gathers like a dewdrop, it is real.</p>
<p>Jadeite: Use a gold tool to grind it. If gold filings can be ground out, it is real. Otherwise, it is fake.</p>
<p>Agate: Grind the agate into powder. If it is not hot, it is real. If it gets hot, it is fake.</p>
<p>Amber: Rub the amber in the palm of your hand until it gets hot. If it can stick to mustard seeds, it is real. Otherwise, it is fake.</p>
<p>Pearls: Place the pearl in a dark room and stand far away to look at it. If it can emit a faint light, it is real. If it is dark and grayish, it is fake.</p>
<p>Crystal: Use Ruizhou fire stone to grind it. If it does not leave any traces, it is real. Otherwise, it is fake.</p>
<p>Ivory: If the grain is natural and curved, it is real. If the grain is clear and straight, it is fake. Also, if it does not change color when coated with sulfuric acid, it is real. If it changes to bamboo stone color, it is fake.</p>
<p>The above points are questioned by contemporary appraisers, is it true or not.</p>
<h3>Thinking About Rickshaws</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>I have always admired the fearless spirit of "rickshaw kuangsheng" (a popular respectful term for drivers). Under the circumstances of being attacked by vehicles from all sides, "Mr. Rickshaw" can often disregard his own safety and boldly stop the rickshaw with a wave of his arm and make a big turn. His spirit of seeing death as returning home and serving bravely is indeed not easy. Unfortunately, once this spirit is "extended to others," passengers are often left in a state of shock and are in mortal danger. For example, when a large truck is about to devour them, "Mr. Rickshaw" recklessly pushes the front half of the rickshaw through, as if the passenger's life in the back half of the rickshaw is none of his business. Thus, the passenger is the first to be sacrificed. Not long ago, on Seymour Road, a rickshaw that was running rampant suddenly braked. As the rickshaw shook, a female passenger happened to fall under the wheels of a trolleybus and was decapitated!</p>
<p>Even so, the popularity of rickshaws has not waned, and it was once called "mandarin duck affairs," which shows that there are many brave passengers in Shanghai. Therefore, after the currency change, all prices were frozen, but rickshaw fares jumped several times. What used to cost 400,000 yuan now costs at least four jiao. It is not uncommon to ask for more than one yuan for slightly longer distances. What's more, these "Mr. Rickshaws" are strict and selfless, with the same work ethic as the meat vendors in the vegetable market. I don't like to see their "faces," especially when it's raining heavily or the wind is blowing. So I only take rickshaws occasionally, and always on sunny days. During strong winds and rain, I would rather sacrifice my clothes and wait for the tram because I hate the bamboo tapping of "taking advantage of others' misfortunes"!</p>
<p>In the past, the catchphrases of "Mr. Rickshaw" were: How much does a pancake cost? How much does rice sell for? Now, pancakes still cost 60,000 legal tender each, and household rice prices have not changed in February. The rickshaw fares have not changed, why do the fares still rise like this? In the past, rickshaw fares were about 10% higher than buses or trams. When tram and bus fares went up, they followed suit. But now, not only have tram and bus fares not risen, but rickshaw fares have soared several times! What is particularly noteworthy is that this phenomenon of sky-high prices has not stopped to this day. In recent weeks, every two or three days, rickshaw fares are bound to be higher than the previous two or three days.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? The only reason "Mr. Rickshaw" has is that the police fines have increased. But does that mean they get fined every day? Recently, I read in the newspaper that the police have reduced fines because of this. But will that be enough to lower the high prices that they have become accustomed to? Probably not.</p>
<p>In fact, the problem is that "if you don't ride, there will be someone else who will." Just like in the vegetable market, as long as you hide them and don't sell, the customers will succumb: "Okay, okay, the price will be as you say."</p>
<p>This phenomenon is caused by a few wealthy consumers who don't care and don't haggle. Thus, "asking for sky-high prices" is unrestrained, and the black market has emerged in response.</p>
