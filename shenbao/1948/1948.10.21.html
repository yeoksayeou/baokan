<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕新聞局息：行政院翁院長於廿日下午發表談話稱：頃閱報戴，美國經濟合作總署駐華分署署長賴樸輪返美後所發表談話，深感美國友人對於吾國同情及好意，他認識中國因共匪覆亂，正在艱苦狀況中努力奮鬥，且亦說明吾國政府當局正在竭誠整頓經濟，以期勝任此時代的艱苦工作；因此，他以為對華援助數量應該加多，時期必需延長。此種意見，與實際情形極為符合，中國國民聞此友誼的呼聲，同感鼓舞．我願世界友人共同瞭解者：中國境內不但有軍舉行動，同時亦有經濟們爭，自從改革幣制之後，金圓券信用昭著，市傷狀況突見穩定，不幸共黨方面加強經濟打擊，他們在華北自由抬高黃金價格，以爭取金條，所以天津黑市金價冠於全國，其他各地亦受其影響；他們又不惜工本，高價搶糧，所以本已穩定的市面，又受其波動，且使平津各市感覺糧荒。對於此種規象，政府正在採取適宜而有效的方法，全力應付，但政府工作自更增艱巨，因此美援份量愈為加多，亦卽政府的穩定經濟扶助人民的力量愈益加強。賴樸翰及其同行來華諸人，歷來工作，對於吾國充份抱有同情瞭解及熟誠協助的態度，中國任事同人素極欣幸，余更願佈此，特為申明。</p>

<h3 id="c22">從美援看美國對外政策 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>最近美國舆論，因關於中國境內共匪叛亂的擴大，東南亞赤色危　的日益深刻，對於美國在軍事上經濟上援助中國的問題，頗多責難美政府的言論。國務院為澄清舆情起見，乃於十一日發表一個「援華報告」，內稱：在軍事援華方面，美國已將八千八百萬美元移交中國政府，以備在美購買槍械·彈藥·飛機·軍胎及無綫電等物；同時又指出美國在經濟援助方面，也已將價值九千八百萬美元之糧食以及其他經濟性物資運往中國</p>
<p>僅看了這個報告所發表的數字，美國在軍事上經濟上援助中國，似乎不能不算是十分積極。但在另一方面，受援的中國總覺得美援是「口惠而實不至」，最近六個月來運來中國的美援物資，對於我國在軍事經濟上的需要，究有多大幫助，實不能不令人發生「杯水車薪，無濟於事」之感。個中的原因究在那裏呢？據我國駐華府的官員談稱，美援物資大部均未運來中國。這是千真萬確的事實，不必再加解說，就是在美國朝野也無法否認此一事實。例如美國霍華特系報紙，於本月十三日發表社論，論及美援問題，除了替中國大聲疾呼而外，同時也說出了美國的老實話。該報社論中有一段稱：「當國民黨尙未與共產黨談妥條件時，美國即停止並取消進出口銀行的對華五億貸款；在蘇聯正將其俘獲之日軍配備供給共軍應用時，美國則禁止軍火運華；現在中國空軍極需汽油，但美國輪入中國之汽油卻較倫入法國者為少；中國政府本希望向美國購買足夠裝配十師兵力之配備，但按之實際，中國僅能購獲不足一師兵力之配備；美國早已將剩餘軍火售與希蠟土耳其，以致使中國不能在市塲上購得廉價軍火。」</p>
<p>從這篇社裏，我們不僅可以看出美國對華援助步化的原因，而且也可以恍然大悟，今日美國政府對於亞洲暨中國局勢的看法，在本質上仍無多大變化，「先歐後亞」的觀念，根深蒂固，仍是支配美國對外政策的一大因素。在美國國務院諸公的眼中，至今似乎仍只看到歐洲局勢的嚴重，只曉得柏林危機足以威脅世界和平，只預見感到共產勢力天天向西歐進迫，而根本漠視了亞洲被赤化的危機。朝鮮的南北分裂；東西亞各國共產勢力的活躍，幾使東南亞成為赤色恐怖的活地獄；中國雖為亞洲安危所緊的柱石，便看看國內的情勢，也是險象環生，共匪在共產國際的支援之下，其叛亂的烽火勢將燒遍半個中國。凡此各端，在美國現當局的心目中，似乎仍舊等閑視之，不覺大禍之將至。即以援華問題而論，去年美國國會討論此事之時，當以「天助自助」美國援助中國，是沒胡問題的，但時至今日，中國不論在政治，軍事，經濟，社會方面，天天在力求革新與進步，但這次實行幣制改革，二月以來，從未獲得美國方面的好評，也未能促進美國政府的積極援華，使一般真正愛護中國的友人，不能不表示遺憾。浦立德先生的「贏得戰爭失了和平」一文，實可視為美國友人批評美國對華政策的正論。</p>
<p>要之，亞洲局勢搓板發蔚縣，中國危機的惡化，已使美國不能不重行檢討其對華政策了。但觀於馬歇爾國務卿對蘇冷戰的新計劃，擬於明春在歐洲與蘇聯攤牌，而在亞洲則採取守勢，可知馬帥仍舊墨守着「先歐後亞」的陳舊觀念。這種政策，將來如仍為美國新政論所採取，則美國必將鑄成歷史性的錯誤。浦立德先生的警語：「歐洲大陸和遠東，都會掉入史太林的手中」，恐怕也有成為的可能了！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據米業中人談：日來南北市場到米情形尙稱通暢，平均每市塲日到七八百石，以來自平　，松江，崑山等地較多，惟產區壓抑斤量之事仍多，又因採辦證有時頒發較遲，食米滯留各地時，常遭擺糧三成，備供當地平　，不無增加米商採辦時之困難。據觀測，今後經管督導員辦公處擬採用以物易物政策後，相信對食米來源，必更暢通云。</p>

<p>本案於十三日初審時，已傳到大部份證人應訊，對各被告貪污舞弊情形，曾作概括訊問，昨日審訊時，除被告孫繼策之妻歐陽德，林克榓之同居女友朱麗春及少數證人未能到庭外，其餘證人四十餘名，均到庭應訊。</p>
<p>聯絡感情普通應酬</p>
<p>九時開審，市府調查本案之梁莊新股長仍到庭作證，庭上首以　告楊耘夫·林克榓兩人所聘請之辯護律師，均在三人以上，超越刑事訴訟法第二十八條之規定，諭令取消其超額之辯護律師。繼傳立與輪船局負責人賀稚英供稱：該局有輪船三叟，過云每月配煤得六十噸，一度得配煤九十噸，去年九月船壞，入廠修理，配得之煤未用，託由韓承溥以黑市價格代售，用煤不敷時，亦請韓補進，出售餘煤係將燃管會所　棧單售出即可，此種情形為商人之打算，極其普通，絕無將餘煤申請退還者。庭上詢來去年八月在國際飯店實請林克榓等，是否即為請求該會給予增配煤量之便利？答係為聯絡感情之普通應酬，江浙輪船公司汪劍平，今年端午節·中秋節，向二人分送烟酒火腿水果等禮物。此外，並供認去年年底曾達兩千萬元，今年端午節送一億元支票各一紙，對渠在管局供認每月「孝敬」一億元事，則加否認，庭上對此點追詰甚嚴，詢渠去年兩千萬元，今年五月一億元，可購米若干？渠答不知。孫繼策供稱：渠及其妻，均不常在家，送禮是否收到不知道。林克榓供：賀請客未到，是否收到賀之送禮，現在已想不起來。庭上以孫妻歐陽德，林之管家女友朱麗春，均未到庭，無由供證，遂令賀退去。</p>
<p>不得不有所「孝敬」</p>
<p>次詢證人松江電氣公司施堅忍，據稱：該公司配煤原為一二〇噸，在去年該會新舊交替時减配二十噸，因此配額實　敷需要，乃向林克榓一再要求增配，去年七月某日，林在會以公事甚忙，囑至則林對渠訴述公務員待遇菲薄，生活清苦，常因「處長」，「科長」等空虛名位，對外應酬頻繁，不勝負担，後由林以下片介紹，往訪孫繼策，孫稱當時煤源不　，以後可予增配，囑光求諸黑市。渠審度兩人之意，不得不有所「孝敬」，乃目去年七月起，每月送兩人二三千萬元不等，最後一次（今年八月）送孫金國二百元，送林一百元，每次送款，均裝入信封內，由職員陸表達送到匯中林之帳房收受，訊諸陸志達，日然。庭上以此點，關係重大，令施對上述情形，重述一遍。林繼辯稱：施先生腦盤不清楚。渠並未以卡片介紹施往訪孫處長，惟代他人向施勸捐，事或有之。庭上次就合衆拖輪局馬忠良經手將七家輪船局餘煤，以黑市價格出售，四六成分賬一節，相繼傳詢早江沈金富，鴻利陸光耀，元大俞關金，元賁嚴阿章，德泰周龍根等配煤及四六分賬情形，均稱由馬忠長經手收款，是否轉付燃管會，不得而知，至中午退庭休息前，楊耘夫並就被控亦官亦商一節提出聲辯。</p>

<p>下午一時，繼續開庭，詢問重點，首在被告鄒濟道向各煤商收取小費，傳詢裕大周星煌，榮與裕魏心碧，大時潘宗禮，華茂胡修德，泰山楊山富，張綿紀張天才等，均供會付鄒車馬費或小費每次數百萬元不等。至此，庭上以案情已全部明瞭，詢問各被告及各人辯護律師，有無反證可以提供。孫·林二被告均稱配煤係秉公辦理，堅持要求庭上調閱燃管會配煤原卷，當經裁定由法警會問被告林克榓至法　室，以電話通知燃管會檔案　，調閱有關案卷，以來迅速結案，在調卷時間內，庭上對各被告之經歷及犯罪感想，分別加以詢問。據楊耘夫供：民國十三年，在之江大學畢業，十六年加入青年黨，歷任湘桂黔路，稅警總團，杭州警局等機關職務，現任青年黨中委及監審委員，去年奉命參加燃管會工作，未　其他使命，以經濟壓觀點言，燃管會缺點甚多，然在現階段中，中國仍適用管制經濟主義，此次被捕，深感突然。孫繼策供：民十四年加入青年黨，畢業於日本士官學校，回國後，歷任參謀長，警備司令，少將副師長等軍職。趙伯鈞供二十二年，在軍校十期畢業，戰前曾任駐日聯絡參謀，回國後曾任團長職務，去年　撤，退役之餘，家境不裕，乃在滬改商，代辦煤斤採購證，並不遵決，希望獲得二成紅利，以維持生活。林克榓供：日本東京警察　校畢業，去年率青年黨命，參加燃管會工作。至三點四十分，燃管會檔卷室職員將各卷送到，經孫·林檢閱的，當即飭回，庭上以案情已明，遂定期於二十七日開始辯論，如無特殊情形，可能於下月三日宣判。謀商韓承溥因病請求交保　准，各議告還押，至下午四時許還庭。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據金融界息：日來銀根逐步趨緊，主要原因，係因本市物資管制綦嚴，資金逐分批外流，至外埠搜購物資。又當局推行聯購國棉及採辦食米等措施，因此又造成資金大批外流。擾估計，半月來本市銀行界存款，最少較前減去十分之三。</p>

<p>據金管局息：最近因市場銀根緊俏，行莊普遍缺單，退票亦因之增多。近又傳行莊限制提現，惟該局尙未接獲是項報告，對以上兩點，該局現正派員分赴上海票據交換所，及各行莊實施檢查，以明真相。</p>

<p>近來本市各銀行錢莊，又呈缺乏現鈔之現象，存戶至各行莊領取一百元以上之現鈔，行莊均無法付出，需守候至午後始可取得。</p>
<p>據金融業負責人分析現鈔缺乏之原因，均為目前等地近日利息高達五角左右，而本市利息較各該地區低多，商人等均紛紛將現鈔携往廣州廈門間拆放。再華南等各地區物資尙無缺乏現象，商人等均携款至各該地區購物囤存，故本市現鈔日呈缺乏，此種現象，除政府加發金圓券外，一時恐難制止云。</p>

<p>月需五萬八千件弱</p>
<p>複製業配紗審核委員會，昨日下午三時，舉行第一次會議。出席委員機器染織業潘士浩，內衣織造業任秉道，棉織業傅良駿，毛紡業葉茀康，及物資共應委員會吳宗才，由社會局顧炳元主席。</p>
<p>首報告自製業調查各工廠所需數量，業於十四日塡送完竣，總數每月約需五萬七千九百七十一件。並決定送工業會技術委員會審核，將來配紗限於十月十四日以前已登記之工廠為限，其新添機器及在登記時尙未使用之機械，及未入公會之工廠，均不在內，該會並定於每星期三開會一次</p>
<p>棉布續停，紡建公司未開售，業內時屆秋令，各貨實銷發動，目下市上嗶嘰直貢藍布士林布卡其等布，存底日減，商號缺貨，供應門市，又被黃牛黨搶購。故大多數市民均無法購得，昨公會當局特令各染織廠大量拋售，以供本市需銷云。</p>

<p>中紡昨配紗銳減，僅六七九件，合金圓四九四，七五五元。計藍單二十支雙喜大包，價七百元。白單六支副日光草包，二百五十五元。又十支副藍鳳筒綫四百八十元，十支雙股豐年草包五百二十八元，十五支豐年草包五百七十三元，四十支寶光草包八百八十元，四十二支寶光草包一千零十元，並分四十二支雙股細紗，限手搖襪手工棉織及織帶公會講購，四十支限手帕內衣業，十五支粗紗限毛巾，十支及十支雙股限帆布業，另配繩帶計有廿五股錠繩，每磅二元一角三角，並有六股九股十股等。</p>

<p>又訊：據悉：國產棉花展開收購聲中，關於已收得棉花之運輸問題，至今尙無法澈底解決。各產區之出口交通路綫，大部遭奸匪破壞，一時無法修複。目前所能利用者，只有空運，但國有或民營之運輸機為數甚少，每機每次只能裝載五噸，較之輪船及火車之載運量，相差甚遠，且其運費特昂，若專告飛機運輸，來源不足供應本市各紗廠之所需，收購當局現為此事焦急云。</p>
<p>現棉平軟</p>
<p>現棉昨日仍無交易，惟人心轉平，緣十六日起各紗廠已不能單獨購花，棉商所握部份存貨，除依照廠合法手續售與聯購外，已不能再與紗廠交易，故市況冷中帶軟。</p>

<p>人絲昨日本街絲織業因聞中信局有停配消息，原料來源頗感恐慌，絲號門銷顧客購買零數，亦多告無貨供售，人心堅俏異常。公會昨日仍配三十二小包，但以數量微細，請購者亦多向隅。生絲內外銷各貨均無應市，本街零担交易亦未聞有做開，市況仍冷。</p>
<p>綢緞各地客帮雲集滬上，需要甚旺，惟以原料問題迄未暢通，廠方開貨甚少，同業多執貨觀望，綢莊零剪門銷，昨日購者又多，人心奇俏。</p>

<p>食米到貨續來，惟數量略見減少，南市米行及米廠到八二六石七斗，米號到八四二石，合計一六八八石七斗。北市到貨總數五九七石，內經售行一六三石，米廠七三〇石，業外自辦六四石，二市場共計到貨二千二百六十五石七斗。市場報價仍照售，南糙粳十七元六角六分，糙秈連袋十七元，交易仍未見展開，麵粉依然停市。</p>
<p>雜糧昨市交易竟陷於停頓，黃豆登記之結果，計有三二七八九包，內二四〇〇〇包已由輸管會核凖出口，尙有存貨，靜待如何分配予豆腐店，故未交易。生仁芝蔴均因存貨不多，乏貨應市，苞米紅糧一致不開。</p>

<p>— 陳紫荷</p>
<p>驚才忍作沉淪想，肝膽流虹傾一巵，山上蘼蕪隨分綠，天涯涕淚幾人知；魂招風雨廬何在？骨委蠻荒夢尙疑，聞道諸兒相望苦，夜寒猶誦毀家詩。——弔達夫</p>
<p>國家勝利未久，卽似聞達夫噩耗，詢之郁氏親族，咸為疑信參半。余難達夫雖山膏好詈，證以年來行藏，亦頗知幾，不致口舌賈禍，且敵寇請降，何敢再逞淫兇？終望其為海外東坡也。光陰苒苒，彈指三年，天涯歸羽，翔止滬壘者連翩而至，達夫縱戀異域，奚能敝屣祖國？嗟夫！達夫殆真死矣！秋月低昂，蟲聲凄厲，縈急達夫，笑言可憶，魂兮何在？枕上成詩，復起挑鐙，略紀交遊始末。</p>
<p>十七年戊辰正月，余謁王二南師於哈同路民厚南里。師，杭州宿儒，幼號神童，讀書過目，至老不忘，經史百家天文地理朝章典故，原原本本，如數家珍；詩古文辭，鉅製鴻篇，美妙無雙；能飲酒，喜與少年議論上下。余年十七，　列門墻，執經問義，如坐春風，時民國三年，高齡六十又二矣。是年冬，師悼亡，明年，子世羣以疾卒，無後，婿金冰孫又於已未六月間病不起，遺二子二女。師以內顧無人，召寡女携子女同居，以無後，取金之一子一女為孫。師雖曠達，亦當謂余曰：一門鰥寡孤獨，吾無孽，殆天之厄我歟！丁卯，國民革命軍將及江浙，懼北軍之負嵎也，乃移眷於滬上。是日展謁，見一少年昂首將出，衣履樸素，貌不甚揚，見余頷首，漫不交一語而去。師曰：此郁達夫。余曰：同門耶？師曰：與女孫訂好久矣。問年已三十三，長公孫十三齡。余愚：聞達夫自有婦，將處公孫？曰：前妻已離。余卒然曰：傷哉棄婦！師默然。旣而，歏曰：老夫今年七十六，世風如此，吾何為力？余遂無言，越日，歸杭，則見公孫偕達夫散步鬧市，未幾，卽聞結婚於日本。此余與達夫相晤之始也。</p>
<p>已已四月，師歸杭，僦居金釵袋巷。聞達夫月必來杭，未把晤也。七月九日以七夕詩就正，達夫方侍飲，讀余詩而大善。余私計治語文者乃喜舊體詩？遂相與談詩。達夫曰：吾於文則新，於詩則舊，適吾性而已。又曰：詩無分古今，能深入而淺出者無不佳。余亦曰：余喜小題大做，亦喜大題小做，惟欲使一首一聯一句中均有大開闔，斯則愛之慕之未能幾耳。達夫大喜曰：此「羣山萬靈赴荊門」可為例也。師顧而樂之。是日縱談痛飲，各至酩酊，此余與達夫訂交之始，歷歷可憶也。</p>
<p>辛未二月，南師以中風遽歸道山，達夫與余同經紀其喪葬，嗣孫未成人，至是，達夫始有居杭意，便夫人之定省也。越一年，風雨茅廬成，廬在城東場官弄，小園負郭，地近報國寺，為兵器貯藏處，旁為浙江圖書館，嘗自詡有文武二庫。時余咍事紹興，每週歸，輙造飲，顧小巷雖僻，車馬常駐，座上則文武大吏，余意頗不然之。旣久，謂達夫曰：往者魯迅阻子歸杭，今奈何與行尸相周旋？要知冠蓋中，無生人氣。達夫曰：吾特藉以溷跡耳，君無憂也。久之，達夫入閩幕，然常，歸輙以印泥漆器見餽。特在人亡，見之腹痛。</p>
<p>八一三事變突起，余盡室遣居越城，與達夫音書頓絕。一日，初冬日暮，達夫忽孑身來訪，余訝問其何來？曰：閩滬斷航，將繞道仙霞以入閩，眷屬在婺，順與故人道別耳。亟具酒勞之。飲次，達夫顧謂余曰：此間不可以久留，有緩急，可來閩，敵於閩無企圖，愼母忘。言至諄諄。余以全家老幼上下廿餘口屆時能否成行為憂。達夫曰：君自有交通工具，何慮為？是夜同止宿龍山旅館，明日，送之登程，珍重而別。孰知卽此一別，竟成永訣。悲夫！</p>
<p>達夫遣四子一女：子某女潔民，孫氏山，孫陽春（飛）殿春（雲）建春，王氏出。陽春肄業上海中學，寄居陳公洽氏家，建春尙留福州某女士處，餘居富陽，孫氏鞠育云。</p>

<p>七年前曾遊其間</p>

<p>笛箏料理更拋荒，玉案金刀思未忘；着一分情天亦老，留千載蹟地能長。　霜不管心僧白，籬菊偏因人更黃；萬事當前多忽略，疑雲疑雨只尋常。</p>
<p>湖上逢恬生</p>
<p>側帽城南非舊時，西風握手見何遲。連年兵氣鴻無訊，此日愁心　可知。如許秋光天亦美，正多離緒腹同披。今朝酒例因君破，但少淵明菊半籬。</p>
<h3 id="c126">受累 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>我每天只知早出晚歸，搶登車子，對於市面上的所謂「搶購」物資，卻未曾覺得，雖然也間接聽到別人談起，我亦不感興趣。但人究竟是社會的動物，我不聞不問社會事，社會事卻要來累我了。</p>
<p>話說我趁着雙十節那天有空，打算去買一套西裝，卻不料才走到四川路，發現十家店舖，倒有九家關門「慶祝」的，那天的西裝就因此沒買成。好，就改在不慶祝什麼的十二日去買。但當我滿懷希望去到西裝店最多的吳淞路時，又給我一個大失所望；西裝「店」是有的，可就是沒有「西裝」。有嗎？不過是些殘衣破服，老闆還沉着臉，龍顏不悅，於是，我只得「見所見而去」了。</p>
<p>怎麼辦呢？幸而我還懂得一點兵法，知道隨機應變。既然買不到西裝，就改變方針，做一套中山裝好了——中國人穿中山裝，還不天經地義嗎？於是馬上就「趕」到南京路，「擠」進一家呢絨店，「憑」着國民身份證，「搶」購了制服呢三碼。</p>
<p>不錯，三碼制服呢足可以做一套中山裝，可是送到成衣店去時，問題又來了，作襯裏的羽紗，通常成衣店是有的，如今也沒有了。問題旣來，就要解決，解決之道，就是自己去買。誰知昨天跑了四十多家店，竟買不到一寸羽紗；拿着身份證也不靈了。</p>
<p>我才恍然大悟，不必說了，我的那份料子，一定是被別人「搶購」去了。</p>
<p>我這次未參加搶購，老實說，並非為的是沒有錢。你別瞧我不過是個窮敎員，但敝校薪水一次就是發好幾個月，決不零零碎碎的拖欠；我於九月中旬卽已拿到金元券五百餘元，做三兩套西裝是綽綽有餘的，但我沒有這麼辦，可就因此而受了累。</p>
<p>何必呢？在本談經則仕。索貝二先生分析，可知「搶購」是搶不出甚麼「便宜」來的。</p>
<p>但是，搶購的人要說了：「我不搶購，別人要搶購，讓別人搶空了，我又到那裏去購呢？」</p>
<p>糟，就糟在這種想法上。今日如此的局面，便是被大家這樣「想」成的。</p>
<h3 id="c127">搶吃 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 馬亟先</p>
<p>星期天，朋友約到到大三元吃早點。時間已不很早，十點鐘了，應該已過了早點的時間，雖是星期，似乎不見得會是十分擁擠的。</p>
<p>但一到大三元，竟想不到從底層到三樓，非但所有的座位早已客滿，站在旁邊，等待前客讓後客的，還是滿坑滿谷地擠足了人。單看這擁擠的情形，任是怎樣好的食慾也會被嚇退的。但經不起朋友的善意勸說，我也終於隨着朋友在擁擠的人堆裏佔得了一個座位。</p>
<p>等了半天，點心久久不來。待到僕歐托着點主在場子裏出現時，食客們已等不及挨次分送，竟各自動手，不揀好歹，搶奪一空。</p>
<p>我和朋友也在這樣的雜亂中搶奪着吃了些不很如意的點心，出來時已快敲十二點了。點吃得不多，但經過了這一場爭奪戰，中飯的胃口已經完全消失。</p>
<p>單是在一餐點心的場合裏所見的畸形現象，「今日有酒今日醉」這種變態心理，已經暴露無遺！</p>
<h3 id="c128">又要禁舞了 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 劉泰</p>
<p>今天看報，才知道原來上海又要禁舞了。</p>
<p>最近幾個月來，禁舞的呼聲似乎是以波浪式的綫條進行的。三月裏所說過要禁，後來未見下文；六月裏說要舉行舞廳曲抽籤，仍舊未見下文；九月裏一度盛傳禁舞令真的要執行了，但是，未見下文如故。現在是十二月禁舞之說已成定局，儼然有必行之勢，到了那時候會不會有下文呢？誰也說不定。</p>
<p>我從不跳舞。不過我對於禁舞一事卻實在發生了興趣——並非因為這件事所牽涉的都是女人，而是覺得我們的官場真正「好白相」。最初是，堂而皇之的決定了要禁，而且對地方當局的請求緩辦都不予置理，似乎倒很有令出必行的氣魄。然而，上海社會局一場紛擾之後，卻就把執行禁舞的命令留中不發了。說是為了顧全那些舞弊從來員的生計，政府的威信稍為受點委曲罷，倒也是仁者之心，政府原是應當以人民的生計問題作為第一件要務的。可是，現在又要禁了！我們倒要問？這次倒底有沒有決心？禁舞也好，不禁舞也好，我們在原則上沒有意見——我們祇想知道一點：會不會再蹈前次那樣虎頭蛇尾的覆轍？</p>
<p>要禁就禁一個決澈，不要到了明年三月六月，各舞場還是笙歌喧天如故。如果這次竟又祇是一套官樣文章，則「文章」之「官樣」雖然不減當年，其如「文章」的題目未免陳腐何！</p>
<h3 id="c129">士與仕 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>「學以致用」一語最為誤人。而為「無用之學」最足以誤已。</p>
<p>譬如胡適之一本正經的考證歐陽修的二件家庭醜事，我們不能說這不是「學」，可是有什麼「用」？高本漢詳究我國古書左傳國語書經詩經莊子相互問文法上的異同，不能謂為非「學」，然於「用」乎何有？他如愛因斯坦的相對論，何嘗有什麼「用」？依「學以致用」之律，必須愛氏學術上的研究與原子彈的構造發生了關係，這才算得有實用可言。</p>
<p>我國傳統的學術，本來是偏重實用方面的多。比方我國時的思想家哲學家，儒家固無論矣，即使是道家陰陽家，講到「道」，講到「太極」，亦莫不以人事政治為中心。純以自然界為對象的理論之學可謂並不多觀。</p>
<p>「致用」二字，我猜在人們的心目之中，其意義還並不如照字面解釋的那麼廣。一般人以為「學而優」則必「仕」。「致用」指的恐怕只是一個「仕」字。因此在一般人的心的深處以為：學而不仕，則又何必學？學而不能仕，則其學尙不優可知。而俗諺又有「千里做官只為財」之說，是則「致用」二字之涵義更收縮為指「有用於已」。凖此，即使講究「致用」如愛迪遜，如他生於我國，亦必須自己設廠制造電燈留聲機等物，發了大財，然後方能使人肅然起敬，歏為偉大。不然的話，他只是個好事的傻子。因在我國，光是做有益於人的事是不大會引起我們的敬仰之心的。我們所佩服的是：一人能大大的設法有利於已。</p>
<p>今日的士人在社會上的地位，業已一落千丈，頗有遭人輕賤之勢。嘗思其故。若說是因為今日的士人窮嗎？然昔之「寒士」並無為人所不齒的現象。而且「富士」素來不多。我猜昔之「士人」受人尊敬，乃是敬其可以成「仕」；今之士人遭人輕賤，無非為了今之為「仕」未必定須「士人」。原來無論今昔，未有單憑其人是士人而尊敬之者。私意以為昔之尊敬是尊敬錯了，今之輕視為輕視錯了。</p>
<p>林語堂「蘇東坡傳」中謂：中國歷來患的是官才過剩症。國人認為「學而優」而不仕乃是不可思議的事，馴至造成了「憎」多「粥」少的現象。如果這種思想不變，則僅是教育普及的結果就足以毀滅中國。因為政府決不能安插四萬萬五千萬的「官才」，云云。誠然。然林氏有所未知：今人對於「士」的看法早已變更。須知今之「學士」未必都是「學仕」，更非「龍圖閣大學士」之謂。而且即使「士」而可「仕」，利亦不厚。今日公務員的待遇，乃以微薄著稱於世。因而親友之中頗有境況可以繼續求學而棄學從商者。蓋讀書已無利可圖，又何必去遭人看不起呢？據此趨勢看來，我國並無教育太普及之危險，我們可以放心。</p>
<p>怕的是：人們固輕「士」而重「仕」之心仍承舊貫，如此則士人固將減少或至於消滅，然官才仍必大增。洵如此，則解救之道便不能單靠極力設法防止教育之普及了。</p>

<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 20th] The Ministry of Finance has already drafted measures to increase the capital of provincial and municipal banks, and will soon submit them to the Executive Yuan for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting. It is understood that the capital for increasing the capital of provincial and municipal banks is to be drawn from the provincial and municipal treasuries. At a time when the finances of various provinces and cities are difficult, it is difficult to transfer a large amount of funds to increase the capital of provincial and municipal banks. Therefore, the measures to increase the capital of provincial and municipal banks will be slightly more relaxed than the measures to increase the capital of commercial banks.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th] At a meeting of the Hong Kong Legislative Council on the 20th, it was proposed to hold the second and third readings of the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement Bill. This important agreement between the two governments of China and Hong Kong in recent years was completed with the final legislative procedures. The case was proposed by Colonial Secretary McDougall and read for the second time at a regular meeting of the Legislative Council. The result of the three discussions was a unanimous vote in favor. It is reported that the first reading of the case was completed two weeks ago. It is further learned that the agreement will take effect as soon as the representative of our customs in Hong Kong and the local authorities have agreed on the measures. Regarding this matter, reliable sources have learned that Dong Le, the Commissioner of Customs of our Kowloon Customs (who was previously summoned back to Shanghai), will remain here to supervise the implementation of the agreement. Mr. Dong indirectly confirmed his new mission yesterday, saying that he had a special duty to stay in Hong Kong. It is reported that the Sino-Hong Kong government signed an agreement in January of this year to prevent smuggling in the waters off southern China. However, due to differences of opinion on the issue of territorial waters for the activities of our customs patrol ships, the agreement was not fully implemented. At the beginning of this month, Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of our Ministry of Finance, was sent to Hong Kong to negotiate with the local authorities, and the differences were resolved. The agreement was originally scheduled to expire in January next year. It has now been agreed that the agreement will be valid for another full year today, and it is stipulated that notice should be given three months before the expiration date.</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Situation in Northeast China is Turning Around; The National Army Steadily and Surely Captures the Main Force of the Communists; Fierce Street Fighting is Still Going on in Changchun <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch on the 20th] How the situation in Northeast China is changing is of great concern to the people of the country. At the same time, they are also very concerned about the Changchun incident. However, according to what this reporter knows, the central government and the local authorities are working hard to turn the situation for the better and are determined to make it happen. The war in the Northeast has been slightly quiet for the past two days. According to evidence from various sources, the National Army's strategy has shifted to steadily and surely capturing the main force of the communists, and the gains and losses of towns have become less important. The attack on Heishan by the Shenyang westward advance corps has also been temporarily suspended, seemingly waiting for a favorable opportunity. The mopping-up work around Xinlitun has not stopped. The 5th and 6th Columns of the communists have fled westward to Fuxin. The 11th Column is also fleeing in a southwest direction to Fuxin, seemingly to prevent the National Army from attacking Fuxin. They have now been forced by the National Army to the Xinchi area in eastern Fuxin. On the Tasha front in western Liaoning, the communists are still doing their best to prevent the National Army from advancing eastward. In addition to the 4th, 7th, and part of the 11th Columns fighting against the National Army, the 3rd Column has also fled from Jinzhou to the Yinqiao area to prevent the strength of the National Army. According to reports, in addition to continuing to attack the communists in the area west of Tasha, the National Army is also moving part of its forces westward, pointing to Xingcheng and Suizhong, in order to open up contact with Shanhaiguan. The Air Force at the Shenyang base has been continuously flying reconnaissance and bombing missions to the west of Liaoning, Jinzhou, and Beizhen to make arrangements for the National Army.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch on the 20th] The National Army's westward advance corps crossed into the Daohao on the 18th and pressed towards Heishan.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 20th] The situation in the Northeast will soon have new developments.

The great battle in western Liaoning is about to begin.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Huludao dispatch on the 20th] The communist army in Jinzhou is preventing refugees from leaving the city, and all tall buildings have been turned to ashes. A part of the National Army that broke through has reached the Nü'er River and will soon make contact with the eastward advancing troops. More than 100 captured communists have been escorted to Huludao. According to them, the artillerymen in the communist army are all Russian communists, and the drivers are mostly from a certain country. The battle on Tasha Mountain intensified again on the evening of the 19th.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] The Northeast Suppression General Headquarters recently released the Changchun battle report: After Zeng Zesheng, the commander of the 60th Army of the Changchun garrison troops, was captured on the 17th, his troops were surrounded and disarmed by the communists. As a result, the positions in the eastern urban area were also occupied by the communists. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Dong Guoguo led the New 7th Army in a fierce battle with the communists in the defense area of the western urban area. Up to 6:00 a.m. this morning, the Suppression General Headquarters received a telegram from Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zheng, requesting it to be forwarded to the President, which read: The New 7th Army has suffered heavy casualties and has transferred its positions, taking the Central Bank as its base. We are upholding the spirit of revolutionary sacrifice, vowing to shed our last drop of blood to repay the Party and the country, and will never fail to live up to the heavy responsibilities entrusted to us by Your Excellency. Fierce street fighting is still going on.</p>
<p>[Telegram] Military sources: After the communist army in Changchun broke into the urban area on the 18th, fierce fighting continued on the 19th and 20th. The communists desperately attacked from the Central Building in the city center, but were all blocked by the National Army.

<h3 id="e15">John Leighton Stuart's Friendly Appeal is Inspiring to the Five Nationalities; President Weng Expresses Gratification in His Speech <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 20th] News Bureau News: Executive Yuan President Weng issued a statement on the afternoon of the 20th, saying: After reading the newspaper report, I was deeply moved by the sympathy and goodwill of American friends for our country in the speech made by John Leighton Stuart, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, after returning to the United States. He recognized that China is struggling hard under difficult conditions due to the communist insurgency, and also explained that our government authorities are sincerely rectifying the economy in order to be competent for the difficult work of this era. Therefore, he believed that the amount of aid to China should be increased and the period must be extended. This kind of opinion is very consistent with the actual situation. The Chinese people of all nationalities are inspired by this friendly appeal. What I would like the friends of the world to understand together is that there are not only military actions in China, but also economic struggles. Since the currency reform, the credibility of the gold yuan has been remarkable, and the market conditions have suddenly stabilized. Unfortunately, the Communist Party has strengthened its economic attacks. They have freely raised the price of gold in North China in order to seize gold bars, so the black market gold price in Tianjin is the highest in the country, and other places have also been affected. They also spare no expense to grab grain at high prices, so the already stable market has been fluctuated again, and the cities of Pingjin have felt a grain shortage. The government is taking appropriate and effective measures to deal with this phenomenon with all its strength, but the government's work has become more difficult. Therefore, the more aid from the United States increases, the more the government's strength to stabilize the economy and help the people increases. John Leighton Stuart and his colleagues who came to China have always had a sympathetic understanding and sincere assistance attitude towards our country, and the Chinese colleagues have always been very fortunate. I would like to declare this, especially to clarify it.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Looking at America's Foreign Policy from the Perspective of American Aid <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Recently, American public opinion, due to the expansion of the communist bandit rebellion within China and the increasingly profound red danger in Southeast Asia, has expressed much criticism of the US government regarding the issue of American military and economic aid to China. In order to clarify public opinion, the State Department issued a "Report on Aid to China" on the 11th, stating that in terms of military aid to China, the United States has transferred 88 million US dollars to the Chinese government to purchase firearms, ammunition, aircraft, military tires, and radios in the United States; it also pointed out that in terms of economic aid, the United States has also shipped food and other economic materials worth 98 million US dollars to China.</p>
<p>Just looking at the figures released in this report, it seems that American military and economic aid to China cannot but be considered very active. However, on the other hand, China, the recipient of aid, always feels that American aid is "a verbal promise that does not materialize." In the past six months, how much help has the American aid material shipped to China been for our country's military and economic needs? It is impossible not to feel a sense of "a cup of water on a cart of firewood, of no avail." What is the reason for this? According to officials from our country stationed in Washington, most of the American aid materials have not been shipped to China. This is an undeniable fact, and there is no need to explain it further. Even in the American government and public, they cannot deny this fact. For example, the American Howard newspaper published an editorial on the 13th of this month, discussing the issue of American aid. In addition to speaking out loudly for China, it also spoke the truth about the United States. A paragraph in the newspaper's editorial stated: "When the Kuomintang had not yet reached an agreement with the Communist Party, the United States stopped and cancelled the 500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank to China; while the Soviet Union was supplying the captured Japanese army with equipment to the Communist army, the United States prohibited the shipment of military supplies to China; now the Chinese Air Force urgently needs gasoline, but the gasoline shipped to China by the United States is less than that shipped to France; the Chinese government originally hoped to purchase enough equipment to equip ten divisions, but in reality, China can only purchase enough equipment to equip less than one division; the United States has already sold the remaining military supplies to Greece and Turkey, so that China cannot purchase cheap military supplies on the market."</p>
<p>From this article, we can not only see the reasons for the slow pace of American aid to China, but also suddenly realize that the current American government's view of the situation in Asia and China has not changed much in essence. The concept of "Europe first, Asia second" is deeply rooted and remains a major factor dominating American foreign policy. In the eyes of the gentlemen in the US State Department, it still seems that they only see the seriousness of the European situation, only know that the Berlin crisis is enough to threaten world peace, only foresee and feel that the communist forces are advancing towards Western Europe every day, and completely ignore the crisis of Asia being reddened. The division of North and South Korea; the active communist forces in various countries in East and West Asia have almost turned Southeast Asia into a living hell of red terror; China, as the pillar of Asian security, looks at the domestic situation, which is also fraught with dangers. Under the support of the Communist International, the flames of rebellion of the communist bandits will burn all over half of China. All of these points seem to be still viewed indifferently in the minds of the current American authorities, unaware of the impending disaster. Taking the issue of aid to China as an example, when the US Congress discussed this matter last year, it was said that "Heaven helps those who help themselves." There is no problem with American aid to China, but to this day, China is striving for reform and progress in politics, military affairs, economy, and society every day. However, this currency system reform has never received good reviews from the United States since February, nor has it promoted the active aid to China from the American government, which makes friends who truly care about China unable to express regret. Mr. Walter Lippmann's article "Winning the War and Losing the Peace" can be regarded as a correct critique of American foreign policy towards China by American friends.</p>
<p>In short, the development of the Asian situation and the deterioration of the Chinese crisis have made the United States have to re-examine its policy towards China. However, judging from Secretary of State Marshall's new plan for the Cold War with the Soviet Union, which plans to have a showdown with the Soviet Union in Europe next spring and adopt a defensive posture in Asia, it can be seen that Marshal Marshall is still sticking to the outdated concept of "Europe first, Asia second." If this policy is still adopted by the new American political theories in the future, the United States will surely make a historical mistake. Mr. Walter Lippmann's warning: "The European continent and the Far East will fall into the hands of Stalin," I am afraid it may also become a reality!</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Executive Yuan Passed a Resolution to Establish Special Criminal Courts in Provinces and Cities to Expand the Scope of Implementation of Emergency Punishment <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 20th] The case of implementing the "Emergency Punishment Act for Endangering the Country during the Suppression of Rebellion" and establishing higher special criminal courts has been passed in the Executive Yuan meeting on the 20th. According to the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Order, cases of violation of price control, if the circumstances are serious, have been telegraphed by the Executive Yuan to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering them to be transferred to the Special Criminal Court in accordance with the "Emergency Punishment Act for Endangering the Country during the Suppression of Rebellion" for severe punishment. However, the scope of implementation of the regulations was originally stipulated by the National Government by order, and the former National Government authorized the Executive Yuan to designate martial law areas and the capital, Shanghai, Wuhan and other twenty-four places to establish higher special criminal courts. In other areas, not only are there no higher special criminal courts to hear cases, but the application of the regulations is also groundless. The case has been reviewed by the Executive Yuan inviting relevant agencies to hold meetings and discuss it.

<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul Dispatch, 20th] One thousand out of 2,500 Korean police officers stationed in Yeosu, the southernmost point of the Korean Peninsula, revolted this morning. A senior official of the Korean government claimed: The rebellion is currently spreading, but the government has taken necessary actions. The 2,500-man detachment stationed in Yeosu was originally scheduled to go to Jeju Island to suppress local rebels led by the Communists. The 1,000 rebels have occupied the Yeosu Police Station. It is said that 800 of them are still resisting the railway police twelve miles north of Yeosu.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul Dispatch, 20th] According to information here, 3,000 security guards revolted in Yeosu, a railroad terminus with a population of one million at the extreme south of Korea, on the night of the 19th, attacking and occupying the city's police force. Southern Korean government officials believe that the police force's rebellion was caused by Communist infiltration and incitement. At present, the rebellion has developed northward and has spread to the Suncheon area. Due to the extremely serious nature of this rebellion, the South Korean Ministry of Internal Affairs refused to allow any foreign reporters to release information about the matter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul Dispatch, 20th] President Syngman Rhee convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 20th to deal with the Communist rebellion in the South. President Rhee is expected to declare martial law immediately. It is generally believed that he will also request the assistance of the US troops stationed in South Korea to suppress the rebellion. According to a report from the Security Bureau, the rebels' goal is to overthrow the government. During Rhee's visit to Japan, US military commander General Coulter stated: This is an internal Korean matter, and the US military does not intend to interfere except to ensure the property and safety of the occupation forces. Unofficial reports claim that the rebellion was launched by leftists and Communist elements who had infiltrated the South Korean security forces. The rebellion happened just as President Rhee returned from his visit to Japan. At the same time, Moscow Radio announced that Soviet troops have begun to withdraw from North Korea according to plan. It is also learned that although Soviet troops had withdrawn from several border strongholds a few days ago, they have been taken over by about 200,000 North Korean troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul Dispatch, 20th] President Syngman Rhee and his party returned to Seoul at 4:45 pm today. Rhee returned to his official residence under heavy military and police protection.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Syngman Rhee Believes That South Korea Can Handle Everything After the Soviet Withdrawal from North Korea; Investment in Korean Mining Is Not Welcome at Present <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch, 20th] President Syngman Rhee of Korea summoned Allied and Korean-Japanese reporters this morning. He said: The people of South Korea have no worries about the expansion of communism or communists in Korea. Regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea, Rhee said: Now that the Soviet army has withdrawn from North Korea, we can solve the problem ourselves without bloodshed. When a reporter asked whether South Korea was strong enough to resist Communist attacks, he said: South Korea's defense relies on the following points, namely: (1) the ability to mobilize; (2) material assistance from friendly countries.</p>
<p>Six months ago, Rhee said that he could mobilize 500,000 people to defend South Korea within six weeks, but he needed weapons and ammunition, and he also hoped that US troops would remain in South Korea. Regarding the issue of foreign investment, Rhee said that although the United States and China both intend to invest in the Korean mining industry, at present the Korean mining industry and public utilities do not accept foreign investment. He plans to nationalize gold mines and other company businesses, and will not accept foreign investment until the plan is mature. Rhee hopes to discuss trade between Korea and Japan with MacArthur during his short stay in Japan. He said that smuggling between China, Japan, and Korea hinders legitimate trade, and the smuggling of Korean rice into Japan has caused a food shortage in the country. Rhee also hopes to discuss the status of Korean residents in Japan with MacArthur. He said: Determining the status of Koreans can reduce the difficulties for Korea, Japan, and the Allied Powers.</p>
<h3 id="e54">US-Korean Economic Agreement Is Currently Under Negotiation <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gyeongseong Dispatch, 20th] The US-Korean economic agreement negotiations, which have attracted much attention, are currently underway, and the content is not available. What is known is that the main points of the negotiations focus on the economic assistance that the United States will provide to Korea in the future. The draft agreement was prepared by the US side and has a total of ten articles, divided into several sub-items. Broadly speaking, Korea must pay an appropriate price for US assistance and make appropriate and planned use of it under the full supervision of the US side. The export of Korean products and import trade must also be subject to control, and assistance materials must not be re-exported. The implementation plan for the economic agreement will be based on the US-Korean agreement concluded when the US military government transferred power to the Korean government in the past. In addition, in order to smoothly promote the implementation plan in the future, the US side will send necessary personnel to stay in Korea. It is said that the US technical experts required for the economic assistance plan total 240 people, including technicians in the fields of electrical engineering, agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, and mining.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow Dispatch, 20th] Czechoslovakia has quickly established diplomatic relations with the North Korean regime, becoming the fourth country to recognize the regime. The Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, and Poland have all announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the regime, and the Soviet Union has appointed an ambassador to the regime.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Seoul, 19th] According to reliable sources yesterday: The North Korean military authorities have exiled more than 50,000 police officers and non-Communist Koreans, who were forced to work in Yekaterinburg, Northeast China, and Siberia. It is said that this expansion of exile is part of a dual plan by the Soviet Union, on the one hand to punish Koreans who do not sympathize with the Democratic People's Republic led by the Soviet Union, and on the other hand to provide forced labor for various arduous tasks such as mining, logging, building roads, and fishing in remote and unsanitary areas under Soviet control.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chicago, 19th, Associated Press] General Hodge, former commander of the US military in Korea, told the Foreign Relations Association here today that since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has violated 16 of the 17 agreements made between the US and the Soviet Union on Korea. Hodge also said that the Soviet army had tried to obstruct every action by the United States to establish a representative government in Korea, and that we had negotiated with them for three years in order to organize a US-Soviet joint committee to jointly govern Korea.</p>
<h3 id="e57">UN Political Committee Passes US Plan for Atomic Control; Further Study by Atomic Energy Commission <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] The United Nations Political Committee passed the Western plan to control atomic energy by an overwhelming majority, considering it a necessary basis for effectively reducing atomic weapons. The Soviet bloc voted against it. The Political Committee voted on the Canadian proposal chapter by chapter, and finally, in a verbal vote, passed the proposal by a vote of 41 to 6, submitting the resolution to the General Assembly for a final formal adoption. The Political Committee first rejected a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union two weeks ago by a vote of 39 to 6. The Soviet Union demanded that the existing US atomic bombs be destroyed at the same time as the establishment of an international atomic energy control agency. Western countries rejected the Soviet plan, insisting that a strict system of international control and supervision must be established first, and then the United States would destroy all its atomic weapons. This is the first time the United Nations has had the opportunity to vote on this issue since Baruch put forward the US plan to the Atomic Energy Commission in June 1946. In the past, the atomic energy issue has only been discussed in the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission. Chapters 1 and 2 of the resolution, based on the US original plan, passed the report of the Atomic Energy Commission by a vote of 40 to 7, with nine abstentions. The Political Committee generally passed the third clause by a vote of 49 to 6, with two abstentions, expressing deep concern about the deadlock reached by the Atomic Energy Commission. Then, the Political Committee, by a vote of 46 to 7, requested the five major powers and Canada to consult informally and privately in an attempt to find a basis for an agreement on atomic energy and the elimination of atomic weapons, with four abstentions. Finally, the last chapter was passed by a vote of 43 to 6, requesting the Atomic Energy Commission to reconvene and continue to conduct "practical and effective" research, with seven abstentions. At the same time, the Political Committee rejected India's proposal by a vote of 23 to 6, with 21 abstentions. India's proposal requested the Atomic Energy Commission to continue its work and draft a treaty on the system as soon as possible. Ukrainian delegate Manuelsky expressed the Soviet view before the final vote, accusing the Canadian proposal of being a plan to permanently maintain the United States' exclusive possession of atomic energy. The Soviet Union and its satellite countries could not prevent the committee from making a decision, because the veto power could not be exercised in the committee. However, this vote can only express an authoritative opinion, and even if the proposal is passed by an overwhelming majority, it cannot make the world closer to solving this problem.</p>

<p>[US Information Service, New York, 19th] President Truman's special advisor on atomic energy, Baruch, said at the annual symposium of the New York Herald Tribune last night that if the Soviet leaders (not the Soviet people) have rejected the United States' ideal of preventing the threat of atomic destruction in the world, then we must continue to manufacture atomic weapons, but the fear of war should not prevent the peaceful use of atomic energy. He said that in the future, atomic energy may enable scientists to use sunlight and substances in seawater to make food. Baruch believes that atomic energy may even enable mankind to use seawater for irrigation to develop the sandy areas along the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] After today's Security Council meeting, acting chairman Bramuglia met with Soviet representative Vyshinsky for 45 minutes. This morning, Bramuglia also met with French Foreign Minister Schuman. In addition, representatives from Britain and France, as well as representatives from the six neutral countries of the Security Council, are also scheduled to meet tonight. According to informed sources, since Bramuglia announced that the Security Council would meet again on the 22nd to discuss the final resolution of the Berlin issue, the behind-the-scenes activities in the past two or three days will inevitably become extremely busy. To date, the three Western Allied countries and the six neutral countries have no specific suggestions for resolving the Berlin issue. The Western countries seem not to hide their intention that concrete suggestions should best be put forward by the neutral countries, so the United Nations attaches great importance to the meetings of the six neutral countries.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Prime Minister Yoshida indirectly requested an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan in order to resolve Japan's current difficulties. After taking office this afternoon, Yoshida made a statement to reporters, saying that Japan must rejoin international organizations as soon as possible, and he called on the Japanese people to work hard to promote democracy so that they can rejoin international organizations with dignity. Although he did not mention the peace treaty, he made it clear that he hoped to conclude the peace treaty as soon as possible, because Japan cannot participate in any international organization unless a peace treaty is concluded. Yoshida, like Katayama, will concurrently hold the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. He will thoroughly study diplomatic procedures in preparation for joining international organizations. He also called on the Japanese people to cooperate so that Japan can return to the international community with peace of mind.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Yoshida Cabinet of Japan held the Emperor's appointment ceremony in the palace at 5 pm on the 19th. Immediately afterwards, the first cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence. The most important agenda item was to review the various bills that the previous cabinet had handed over for discussion at the temporary parliament. However, because the Democratic Liberal Party was in the opposition at that time, most of the proposals and reasons formulated by the Democratic Party were revised. However, the recess period of the temporary parliament should not be delayed for too long. The first cabinet meeting decided to hold continuous meetings starting from the 21st in order to complete the proposals as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The newly appointed Prime Minister Yoshida of Japan announced the appointment of five people, including Eiichi, as private advisors who will work at the Prime Minister's official residence. The recently announced private advisors to the Prime Minister include Kiyoshiro Shidehara, Eijiro Uehara, Longfu Saito, Yuzo Shigemune, and Hidejiro Ohnogi. Takeshi Yamazaki, who was previously rumored to be hired as an advisor, is not included. It is worth noting whether this shows that Yoshida and Yamazaki have had disagreements due to the competition for the Prime Minister's nomination.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] A broadcast from Paris on the 20th: A fierce debate took place in the United Nations Political Committee here over whether the entire Palestine issue should be discussed immediately. The Soviet bloc accused other countries of trying to postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue until after the US presidential election. The Cuban representative suggested replacing it with a resolution proposed by Mexico, requesting the five major powers to end the Cold War and cooperate for world peace. The Latin American bloc immediately supported the Cuban proposal. However, the Soviet bloc immediately pointed out that this move was an attempt to postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue until after the US presidential election. Polish representative Katz-Suchy and Belarusian representative Tsisslejew spoke in the General Assembly with great emotion. It is rumored that the Western powers intend to postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue. Katz-Suchy said, "We cannot postpone the discussion of the Palestine issue until after November 2nd." Syrian representative Khouri, speaking on behalf of the Arab bloc, said that the Security Council had already included the Palestine issue on the agenda, and according to the Charter, the UN committee should not discuss this issue again. Soviet representative Malik accused the Western powers of trying to postpone the discussion of Palestine with new excuses. British representative Cickles said that the British government certainly believes that the Palestine issue is an urgent issue, but most countries believe that it is too early to make a resolution at this time. The Political Committee ultimately passed the Cuban proposal by a vote of 34 to 11, postponing the discussion of the Palestine issue.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] In order to promote the exchange of goods between three provinces and two cities and stabilize the economy of the Southeast region, the Shanghai District Goods Regulation Committee convened a meeting at 11:00 a.m. yesterday, chaired by Chairman Liu Gongyun. Attendees included Inspector General Jiang Jingguo, Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau Director Xie Zhengfu, Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaiguang, Jiangsu Provincial Government Construction Office Director Qian Zhenrong, Social Affairs Office Director Niu Changyao, Zhejiang Construction Office Director Gong Peicheng, Grain Purchase Association Chairman Yang Zhuo, and Central Bank Audit Office Director Li Lixia.

<p>[This Newspaper Report] From 4:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. yesterday, Jiang Jingguo convened a meeting with the county magistrates of rice-producing counties such as Changshu, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Taicang. It was reported that the most important decision at the meeting was that when Shanghai rice merchants go to other places to purchase rice, the price will be paid in gold yuan first, but the other party will be allowed to purchase industrial finished products from Shanghai for 75 percent of the price with a certificate, and the managing authorities here will allow them to transport them out of the country.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to people in the rice industry: The situation of rice arrivals in the North and South Markets has been relatively smooth recently, with an average of 700-800 shi arriving at each market per day, mostly from Pingwang, Songjiang, Kunshan, and other places. However, the suppression of weight in the producing areas is still common, and because the issuance of purchase certificates is sometimes delayed, when rice is滞留(detained) in various places, it is often taxed 30%, which is used for local stabilization purposes, which inevitably increases the difficulty for rice merchants to purchase. According to observations, it is believed that after the office of the managing inspectorate plans to adopt a barter trade policy, the source of rice will definitely be smoother.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the City Grain Business Association: since the ban on sugar exports on September 10, there has been no shortage of stock in this city. However, scalpers have been breaking down the price-controlled goods into smaller units, accumulating small amounts of sugar, and reselling them through multiple hands, raising prices and making profits, leading to a black market. The association has urgently resolved: (1) to continue to meet the purchase needs of sugar-requiring industries with the sugar voluntarily concentrated and sold publicly by fellow businesses, with prices limited to the August 19 market price; (2) to expedite inventory registration by fellow businesses. Once registration is closed within the next few days, a list of the stock will be created and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval of buyer targets, and supplies will be provided at the price-controlled rate as much as possible. Currently, more than 100,000 dan of stock has already been paid for by customers in other cities. Now, customers in various cities are complying with regulations and preparing their local government documents to come and pick up the goods. The question of whether to withdraw and deliver these goods from the stock, or to first transfer them for sale in this city and then repurchase from Taiwan Sugar Corporation for supply, was decided by the board of directors and supervisors yesterday and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. In the future, various sugar-requiring industries in this city can submit lists through their associations and request approval from the Social Affairs Bureau for sugar supply as much as possible. However, direct consumption by citizens will still need to follow the usual practice of purchasing in small quantities from local product stores.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Milk Powder is Unavailable on the Market; The Main Reason is Import Restrictions <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Amidst the abnormal supply of Western medicine, milk powder has also completely disappeared from the market recently. Although there are still one or two stalls selling loose milk powder released by the Materials Supply Bureau on the streets, they are very few in number. Families with infants have no choice but to switch to ordering fresh milk from the less than ten milk companies in the city. However, several of the larger companies have limited daily production. Under the situation of supply not meeting demand, they have recently stopped accepting new subscribers. According to the New Medicine Industry Association, the recent shortage of milk powder is due to the result of panic buying, but the main reason is still the import restrictions by the Transportation Control Committee.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the authorities announced that national identity cards would be reissued across the board at the end of the month and notified citizens to prepare photos, residents of various districts have been flocking to photography studios with the old and the young in tow in recent days to have their photos taken. As a result, all photography studios are extremely crowded, and several in the central district even require queuing. According to statistics from the industry association, each photography studio has been serving about 500 people or more per day recently, and the amount of film consumed has increased sharply compared to before. However, the import of film has recently been restricted, and the stock in this city is not very large.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Daqing Company at 421 Ningbo Road is accused of private gold and foreign currency speculation. The Special Criminal Court summoned Deng Zhonghe, a shareholder of the company, yesterday afternoon. Deng went to the Special Criminal Court at 2:00 PM and was interrogated by Prosecutor Zhu Cheng. According to Deng, Xiao Xueyong, manager of Hailong Wool Weaving Factory, had previously paid Zhang Houqin, manager of Daqing Company, 30,000 pounds in cash to purchase 1,600 wool spinning spindles. This matter was approved by the Transportation Control Committee and issued a certificate of permission for foreign exchange settlement, so the foreign currency was not transferred privately. He presented the Transportation Control Committee certificate and the Social Affairs Bureau registration certificate (manager is Zhang Houqin) in court, and stated that he was only one of several shareholders of the company and was not usually responsible for actual duties. He was not very clear about the internal situation of the company. As for Xiao Xueyong, he had already gone to Hong Kong. Prosecutor Zhu believed that the evidence presented by Deng was sufficient to prove that the case was not related to him and ordered him to be released. The circumstances of the transfer of foreign currency between Xiao Xueyong and Zhang Houqin will continue to be investigated. The interrogation lasted until after 3:00 PM.

<h3 id="e92">Embezzlement by Fuel Control Committee Officials: Testimony from Merchants Vividly Depicts the Situation; Six-Hour Trial Session Concludes, Debate Scheduled to Begin on the 27th <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xie Zhiying, a judge from the District Court, continued the trial of the Fuel Control Committee officials' embezzlement and fraud case in Criminal Court No. 8 yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The defendants, including Yang Yunfu, Director of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Control Committee; Zou Jidao, Clerk and Coal Merchant; Zhao Bojun, Retired Military Officer; Mao Meiqi, Coal Merchant; and Sun Jice, Director of the Distribution Department of the Fuel Control Committee; Lin Keji, Section Chief; Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, Clerks; Sun Zhigang, General Affairs Officer of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Inland River Shipping Company; and Han Chengpu, Coal Merchant, totaling twelve individuals, were brought in early in the morning. Family members rushed to the waiting room to deliver food to the defendants and offer words of comfort.</p>
<p>During the initial trial on the 13th, most of the witnesses had been summoned to testify, and a general inquiry had been made regarding the defendants' embezzlement and fraudulent activities. During yesterday's trial, except for Sun Jice's wife, Ouyang De, Lin Keji's live-in girlfriend, Zhu Lichun, and a small number of witnesses who were unable to attend, over forty witnesses appeared in court to testify.</p>
<p>Ordinary Socializing to Foster Relationships</p>
<p>The trial commenced at 9:00 AM. Liang Zhuangxin, the section chief from the Municipal Government who investigated the case, also attended as a witness. The court first stated that the defendants Yang Yunfu and Lin Keji had hired more than three defense lawyers, exceeding the provisions of Article 28 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and ordered the dismissal of the excess lawyers. Subsequently, He Zhiying, the person in charge of the Shipping Bureau, testified that the bureau had three ships, which previously received 60 tons of coal per month, and at one point received 90 tons of coal. In September of last year, the ships broke down and were sent to the factory for repairs. The allocated coal was not used and was entrusted to Han Chengpu for sale at black market prices. When coal was insufficient, Han was also asked to supplement it. Selling the remaining coal involved selling the warehouse receipts from the Fuel Control Committee, which was a common business practice, and no one ever applied to return the remaining coal. The court inquired whether the dinner at the International Hotel last August, where Lin Keji and others were invited, was to request the committee to increase coal allocation. The response was that it was ordinary socializing to foster relationships. Wang Jianping of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Shipping Company admitted to sending gifts of cigarettes, alcohol, ham, and fruit to the two during the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival this year. Furthermore, he admitted to sending two checks, one for 20 million yuan at the end of last year and another for 100 million yuan during the Dragon Boat Festival this year. He denied having admitted to "tribute" of 100 million yuan per month to the management bureau. The court pressed him on this point, asking how much rice could be purchased with 20 million yuan last year and 100 million yuan this May. He replied that he did not know. Sun Jice testified that he and his wife were not often at home, and he did not know whether gifts were received. Lin Keji testified that he did not attend He's dinner and could not recall whether he had received gifts from He. The court noted that Sun's wife, Ouyang De, and Lin's housekeeper girlfriend, Zhu Lichun, were not present and could not provide testimony, so He was dismissed.</p>
<p>Having No Choice But to Offer "Tribute"</p>
<p>Next, Shi Jianren of the Songjiang Electric Company testified that the company's original coal allocation was 120 tons, but it was reduced by 20 tons when the Fuel Control Committee transitioned between old and new personnel last year. As a result, the allocation was insufficient, so he repeatedly requested Lin Keji to increase it. One day in July last year, Lin told him that he was very busy with official duties and asked him to come to his residence. Lin then complained that the salaries of civil servants were meager, and their lives were difficult. They often had to handle frequent social engagements due to their empty titles of "Director" and "Section Chief," which they could not afford. Lin then introduced him to Sun Jice, who said that coal supplies were tight at the time but that an increase could be arranged later, and suggested seeking supplies on the black market. He assessed their intentions and felt he had no choice but to offer "tribute." Therefore, starting in July last year, he sent them amounts ranging from 20 to 30 million yuan each month. The last time (August this year), he sent Sun 200 gold yuan and Lin 100 yuan. Each time, the money was placed in an envelope and delivered by the clerk Lu Biao to Lin's accountant at Huizhong. Lu Zhida confirmed this. The court considered this point to be of great importance and ordered Shi to repeat the above situation. Lin then argued that Mr. Shi's memory was unclear. He did not introduce Shi to Director Sun with a card, but he might have solicited donations from Shi on behalf of others. The court then successively questioned Shen Jinfu of Zaojiang, Lu Guangyao of Hongli, Yu Guanjin of Yuanda, Yan Azhang of Yuanbi, and Zhou Longgen of Detai regarding Ma Zhongliang of the United Tugboat Bureau's handling of the sale of surplus coal from seven shipping bureaus at black market prices and the four-six split of the profits. They all stated that Ma Zhongliang handled the collection of payments and they did not know whether the money was transferred to the Fuel Control Committee. Before adjourning for lunch, Yang Yunfu also defended himself against the accusation of being both an official and a businessman.</p>
<p>Inquiring About Experiences and Feelings About the Crimes</p>
<p>The trial continued at 1:00 PM. The focus of the inquiry was on the defendant Zou Jidao collecting tips from various coal merchants. Zhou Xinghuang of Yuda, Wei Xinbi of Rong Yuyi, Pan Zongli of Dashi, Hu Xiude of Huamao, Yang Shanfu of Taishan, and Zhang Tiancai of Zhang Mianji all testified to paying Zou transportation fees or tips ranging from several million yuan each time. At this point, the court considered the case to be fully understood and asked the defendants and their defense lawyers whether they had any rebuttal evidence to provide. The defendants Sun and Lin both claimed that coal allocation was handled impartially and insisted that the court review the original records of the Fuel Control Committee's coal allocation. The court ruled that the bailiffs should accompany the defendant Lin Keji to the archives room and notify the Fuel Control Committee's archivist by telephone to retrieve the relevant case files to expedite the conclusion of the case. During the time spent retrieving the files, the court questioned each defendant about their experiences and feelings about the crimes. According to Yang Yunfu's testimony, he graduated from Zhijiang University in 1924 and joined the Youth Party in 1927. He held positions in the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, the Tax Police Corps, and the Hangzhou Police Bureau. He is currently a member of the Central Committee and a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Youth Party. Last year, he was ordered to participate in the work of the Fuel Control Committee and had no other missions. From an economic perspective, the Fuel Control Committee had many shortcomings, but at the current stage, China is still suitable for a controlled economy. He felt suddenly arrested. Sun Jice testified that he joined the Youth Party in 1925, graduated from the Japanese Military Academy, and after returning to China, held military positions such as Chief of Staff, Garrison Commander, and Major General Deputy Division Commander. Zhao Bojun testified that he graduated from the tenth class of the military academy in 1933. Before the war, he served as a liaison officer stationed in Japan. After returning to China, he served as a regimental commander. Last year, he was dismissed and retired. Due to his poor financial situation, he changed to business in Shanghai, acting as an agent for coal purchase certificates. He did not violate any laws and hoped to obtain a 20% commission to maintain his livelihood. Lin Keji testified that he graduated from the Tokyo Police School in Japan. Last year, he was ordered by the Youth Party to participate in the work of the Fuel Control Committee. At 3:40 PM, the staff of the Fuel Control Committee's archives room delivered the files. After Sun and Lin reviewed them, they were immediately returned. The court considered the case to be clear and scheduled the debate to begin on the 27th. If there were no special circumstances, the verdict could be announced on the 3rd of next month. Han Chengpu, the merchant involved, requested bail due to illness and was granted. The other defendants were remanded in custody and returned to the court at around 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Tightening Credit Continues, Capital Outflow Intensifies <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to financial circles, credit has been gradually tightening recently. The main reason is that material controls in this city are extremely strict, and capital is gradually flowing out in batches to purchase materials in other regions. Furthermore, the authorities' implementation of joint purchases of national cotton and the procurement of rice have also resulted in a large outflow of capital. It is estimated that in the past half-month, the deposits of banks in this city have decreased by at least 30%.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals Not Allowed <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Financial Control Bureau Dispatches Inspectors</p>
<p>According to the Financial Control Bureau, due to the recent tightening of credit in the market, banks and financial institutions are generally short of funds, and bounced checks have increased accordingly. Recently, there have also been reports of banks and financial institutions restricting cash withdrawals. However, the bureau has not yet received any reports on this matter. Regarding the above two points, the bureau is currently dispatching personnel to the Shanghai Clearing House and various banks and financial institutions to conduct inspections to ascertain the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e95">High Interest Rates at Hua Tong, Cash Being Transported South <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recently, banks and financial institutions in this city have again experienced a shortage of cash. Customers who go to the banks and financial institutions to withdraw cash of 100 yuan or more are unable to receive it immediately and must wait until the afternoon to obtain it.</p>
<p>Financial industry leaders analyze that the reason for the shortage of cash is that the interest rates in other regions have recently reached around 5%, while the interest rates in this city are much lower. Merchants are transporting cash to Guangzhou and Xiamen for lending. Furthermore, there is no shortage of materials in southern China and other regions, and merchants are taking funds to purchase and stockpile materials in these regions. Therefore, cash in this city is becoming increasingly scarce. This phenomenon will be difficult to stop for the time being unless the government issues more gold yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Replicated Industry Rationed Yarn <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Monthly Demand Weak at 58,000 Pieces</p>
<p>The Replicated Industry Rationed Yarn Review Committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The committee members present were Pan Shihao from the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Ren Bingdao from the Underwear Knitting Industry, Fu Liangjun from the Cotton Weaving Industry, Ye Fikang from the Wool Spinning Industry, and Wu Zongcai from the Material Supply Committee, chaired by Gu Bingyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>First, it was reported that the survey of the quantity required by each factory in the self-manufacturing industry had been completed and submitted on the 14th, with a total monthly demand of approximately 57,971 pieces. It was also decided to send it to the Technical Committee of the Industrial Association for review. In the future, yarn rationing will be limited to factories registered before October 14. Newly added machinery, machinery that was not in use at the time of registration, and factories that are not members of the association will not be included. The committee also decided to meet once every Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth is still suspended. The Spinning and Construction Company has not yet opened for sale. As autumn approaches, the industry is launching a campaign to sell goods. Currently, the stock of serge, straight tribute blue cloth, Shilin cloth, khaki cloth, and other fabrics on the market is decreasing daily. Merchants are short of goods to supply to retail outlets, and they are being snapped up by scalpers. Therefore, most citizens are unable to purchase them. Yesterday, the association authorities ordered various dyeing and weaving factories to sell large quantities to meet the needs of the city, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e97">China Textile's Yarn Rationing Sharply Reduced, Cotton Cloth Not Sold Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>China Textile's yarn rationing was sharply reduced yesterday, with only 679 pieces, totaling 494,755 gold yuan. This included blue-labeled 20-count Double Happiness large packages, priced at 700 yuan. White-labeled 6-count Auxiliary Sunlight rough packages, 255 yuan. Also, 10-count Auxiliary Blue Phoenix spools, 480 yuan, 10-count Double-Strand Harvest rough packages, 528 yuan, 15-count Harvest rough packages, 573 yuan, 40-count Baoguang rough packages, 880 yuan, and 42-count Baoguang rough packages, 1,010 yuan. Furthermore, 42-count double-strand fine yarn was allocated to the hand-cranked sock, hand-knitted cotton, and weaving belt associations. 40-count yarn was limited to the handkerchief and underwear industries. 15-count coarse yarn was limited to towels, and 10-count and 10-count double-strand yarn were limited to the canvas industry. Additionally, there were 25-strand twines for rope and belt rationing, priced at 2.13 yuan per pound, as well as 6-strand, 9-strand, and 10-strand twines.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that the yarn rationing for this month is uniformly 20-count Double Happiness, priced at 700 yuan per piece, allocated to Chongming (2 pieces), Yin County (40 pieces), Jingjiang (5 pieces), Yongjia (42 pieces), Yongkang (2 pieces), Jiading (43 pieces), Jiangdu (9 pieces), Changsha (24 pieces), Nanchang (3 pieces), and Yiyang (6 pieces). All applications are to be made using blue-colored purchase slips, and payment is to be made to the Central Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e98">To Resolve the Domestic Cotton Shortage, Two Batches of U.S. Cotton to be Utilized <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The second batch of 220,000 bales of U.S. aid cotton, decided by the U.S. Aid Cotton Group to alleviate the cotton shortage, will have half of it extracted first for distribution to various factories. The inventory list has been calculated, and the distribution procedures and proportions will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the first batch.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that the Qingdao China Textile Branch Factory suspended operations due to a cotton shortage, significantly affecting production. The U.S. Cotton Association sent Wei Tefeiqing to investigate and confirmed that the situation was indeed serious. It has now been decided to extract and utilize over 10,000 bales of U.S. cotton frozen in Qingdao first.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Transportation Problems Cannot Be Resolved <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Also, it has been learned that regarding the problem of transporting the cotton already collected from domestic cotton purchases, a solution has not yet been thoroughly resolved. The export transportation routes in various production areas have been largely destroyed by bandits and cannot be repaired for the time being. Currently, the only available option is air transport, but the number of state-owned or private transport aircraft is very small, and each aircraft can only carry 5 tons per trip, which is far less than the carrying capacity of ships and trains. Furthermore, the freight costs are particularly high. If aircraft are used exclusively for transportation, the supply will not be sufficient to meet the needs of various yarn factories in this city. The purchasing authorities are currently anxious about this matter, it is said.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Prices Are Soft</p>
<p>There were no transactions in current cotton yesterday, but market sentiment has softened. Since the 16th, various yarn factories have not been able to purchase cotton independently. Apart from selling to joint purchases in accordance with the factories' legal procedures, cotton merchants can no longer trade with yarn factories, so the market is quiet and soft.</p>
<p>Rayon Rationing Continues</p>
<p>Also, according to the Central Trust Bureau, the quota for rayon this week remains as allocated. Italian rayon for barter will be allocated at 3% of last week's allocation, with a listed price of 1,033.3 yuan per case.</p>
<h3 id="e100">No Silk Fabrics Available on the Market <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Due to rumors from the Central Trust Bureau of a possible suspension of rayon rationing, silk weaving businesses on the street were quite alarmed about the source of raw materials. Sales staff at silk shops also reported that they had no goods to sell even to customers buying small quantities. Market sentiment was exceptionally firm. The association still allocated 32 small packages yesterday, but the quantity was so small that many applicants were disappointed. Both domestic and export raw silk were unavailable, and there were no retail transactions heard of on the street. The market remained cold.</p>
<p>Silk and satin merchants from various regions gathered in Shanghai, with strong demand. However, due to the fact that the raw materials problem has not yet been resolved, factories are producing very few goods. Most businesses are holding onto their goods and observing the situation. There were many buyers at silk shops selling retail cuts yesterday, and market sentiment was exceptionally strong.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Transactions Still Not Underway, Rice Arrivals Slightly Less, Miscellaneous Grains Trading at a Standstill <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Rice arrivals continued, but the quantity decreased slightly. The rice shops and rice mills in the Southern District received 826 stones and 7 dou, and the rice brokers received 842 stones, totaling 1,688 stones and 7 dou. The total arrivals in the Northern District were 597 stones, including 163 stones sold by the sales shops, 730 stones by the rice mills, and 64 stones self-managed by non-industry entities. The total arrivals in the two markets were 2,265 stones and 7 dou. Market prices remained unchanged, with Southern unpolished japonica rice at 17.66 yuan and unpolished indica rice with bags at 17 yuan. Transactions were still not underway, and flour remained suspended.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market saw trading at a standstill yesterday. As a result of the soybean registration, there were 32,789 packages, of which 24,000 packages had been approved for export by the Transportation Management Committee. There was still stock, waiting to be distributed to tofu shops, so there were no transactions. Groundnuts and sesame seeds were unavailable due to limited stock. Corn and sorghum were unanimously not being traded.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Sugar Supply Cannot Meet Demand <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Sugar trading was still scarce yesterday. The phenomenon of customers scrambling to purchase at retail outlets on the street became even more congested. Various southern goods shops have been restricting purchases since yesterday. The stocks held by sugar wholesalers have been centrally allocated by the association, so supply has also been suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Tea Market Trading Narrow <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Recently, although Hua tea exports have not been smooth, exporters, foreseeing the state of production and inventory, continued to intend to engage in purchases to prepare for the future. However, principals believe that it is difficult to collect and procure raw tea materials. At the same time, due to the difficulty in purchasing all the ancillary items for replicating and exporting boxed tea, there is no urgent desire to dispose of the goods in hand. Therefore, supply and demand are still difficult to match, and trading remains narrow. The underlying trend continues to be stable. As for domestic tea, demand is still greater than supply, and the market atmosphere is firm amid calm.</p>

<p>[Asked by Dai Songzhi] I recently purchased a house and plan to go to the relevant authorities to register the transfer of title. I have several questions and would appreciate your answers: (1) Are the house purchase contract and all related documents required to be submitted to the Land Administration Bureau for verification? (2) After the relevant authorities accept the registration, is it necessary to publish a notice in the newspaper? If someone objects to this transaction, how should I deal with it? (3) If someone files an objection at this time, can the relevant authorities cancel the issued ownership certificate?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuang] (1) It should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 74 of the Land Law. (2) After the competent municipal and county land administration authorities examine and prove that there are no errors, they will issue a land ownership certificate and a land map, cancel the original land rights documents, and there is no limited period for public notice. (3) If someone raises an objection with the land administration authority after obtaining the new ownership certificate, the land administration authority can only order them to resolve it through the courts and cannot cancel the ownership certificate already issued to the original owner without a confirmed judgment.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Yu Dafu and Wang Ernan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zihe</p>
<p>Astonishing talent endured a sinking thought, liver and guts flowed rainbows pouring out a goblet, mountain parsley grew green according to its lot, how many people know of tears at the edge of the world; where is the soul-recalling wind and rain hut? bones abandoned in the barbarian lands, the dream still uncertain, hearing that the children miss each other bitterly, the night cold, they still recite the poems of ruining the family. — Eulogy to Dafu</p>
<p>Not long after the national victory, it seemed I heard of Dafu's tragic news. I inquired of the Yu family's relatives, and they were all half doubting and half believing. Although I disliked Dafu's mountain spirit, I knew his actions in recent years and that he was quite discreet. He would not bring disaster upon himself with his words. Moreover, the enemy had surrendered, so how dare they again indulge in evil deeds? In the end, I hoped that he would be an overseas Su Shi. Time passed quickly, and three years flew by. Birds returning from the edge of the world flew back to the Shanghai fortress one after another. Even if Dafu was in love with a foreign land, how could he abandon his motherland? Alas! Dafu is truly dead! The autumn moon hangs low, and the insect sounds are mournful. I remember Dafu's urgent laughter and words. Where is his soul? I composed a poem in my sleep, got up again to trim the lamp, and briefly recorded the beginning and end of our friendship.</p>
<p>In the first month of the year Wu Chen in the seventeenth year [of the Republic], I visited Master Wang Ernan at Minhou Nanli on Hartung Road. The master was a learned scholar from Hangzhou, known as a child prodigy in his youth. He read books with a glance and never forgot them, even in his old age. He knew the classics, histories, hundred schools of thought, astronomy, geography, court rules, and allusions, all verbatim, as if counting family treasures. His poems, ancient prose, grand compositions, and magnificent articles were unparalleled. He could drink alcohol and liked to discuss matters with young people. I was seventeen years old and joined his school, studying the scriptures and asking for definitions, as if sitting in a spring breeze. At that time, it was the third year of the Republic, and he was sixty-two years old. That winter, the master mourned his deceased wife. The next year, his son Shi Qun died of illness without an heir. His son-in-law Jin Bingsun also passed away due to illness in the sixth month of Yiwei, leaving behind two sons and two daughters. The master, seeing that there was no one to care for him at home, summoned his widowed daughter to live with him and her children. Because he had no heir, he took one son and one daughter of Jin as his grandchildren. Although the master was open-minded, he said to me: A family of widowers, widows, orphans, and the lonely. I have no sins, is this not the calamity of Heaven upon me? In Dingmao, as the National Revolutionary Army approached Jiangsu and Zhejiang, fearing the resistance of the Northern Army, he moved his family to Shanghai. That day, when I went to pay my respects, I saw a young man about to leave with his head held high. His clothes and shoes were plain, and his appearance was not very outstanding. He nodded to me but did not say a word and left. The master said: This is Yu Dafu. I said: Is he a fellow student? The master said: He has been engaged to my granddaughter for a long time. I asked if he was thirty-three years old, and his eldest grandson was thirteen years old. I foolishly asked: I heard that Dafu already has a wife, will he marry his grandson? He said: His former wife has divorced. I suddenly said: How sad for the abandoned wife! The master was silent. Then, he sighed and said: This old man is seventy-six years old this year. The world is like this, what can I do? I was speechless. The next day, I returned to Hangzhou, and I saw Gongsun strolling in the downtown area with Dafu. Not long after, I heard that they were married in Japan. This was the beginning of my meeting with Dafu.</p>
<p>In the fourth month of Yiwei, the master returned to Hangzhou and rented a place in Jinchai Dai Alley. I heard that Dafu would come to Hangzhou every month, but I had not met him. On the ninth day of the seventh month, I asked for corrections on a Qixi poem. Dafu was serving drinks, and he greatly admired my poem after reading it. I privately wondered, do those who study language like old-style poems? So we talked about poetry. Dafu said: I am new in literature but old in poetry. It suits my nature. He also said: Poetry has no distinction between ancient and modern. Those who can go deep and come out shallow are all good. I also said: I like to make a big deal out of small topics, and I also like to make a small deal out of big topics. I only want to make every poem, every couplet, and every sentence have great openness and closure. This is what I love and admire, but I have not been able to achieve it. Dafu was very happy and said: This "ten thousand spirits from the mountains go to Jingmen" can be an example. The master looked at us and was happy. That day, we talked and drank to our heart's content, each reaching a drunken state. This was the beginning of my friendship with Dafu, and I remember it vividly.</p>
<p>In the second month of Xinwei, Master Nan suddenly passed away due to a stroke. Dafu and I jointly managed his funeral. His grandson had not yet come of age. From then on, Dafu had the intention of living in Hangzhou, for the sake of his wife's family. A year later, the thatched cottage was completed. The cottage was located in the Changguan Alley in the east of the city, with a small garden near Baoguo Temple. It was a storage place for weapons, next to the Zhejiang Library. He often boasted that he had two warehouses, one for literature and one for military. At that time, I was working in Shaoxing. Every week when I returned, I would always go to drink. However, although the alley was remote, carriages and horses often stayed there. The guests were literary and military officials. I did not like it very much. After a long time, I said to Dafu: In the past, Lu Xun prevented you from returning to Hangzhou, but why do you associate with walking corpses now? You must know that there is no vitality in the officialdom. Dafu said: I am just using it to mix in, don't worry. After a long time, Dafu entered the Fujian government. However, he often returned and gave me lacquerware with seals as gifts. Especially after he died, seeing them made my stomach ache.</p>
<p>The August 13th Incident broke out suddenly, and I sent my entire family to live in Yuecheng. There was no news from Dafu. One day, in early winter at dusk, Dafu suddenly came to visit alone. I asked him in surprise where he came from. He said: The sea route from Fujian to Shanghai is cut off. I will detour through Xianxia to enter Fujian. My family is in Wu. I will say goodbye to old friends by the way. I quickly prepared wine to reward him. During the drink, Dafu turned to me and said: You cannot stay here for long. If there is an emergency, you can come to Fujian. The enemy has no plans for Fujian, remember carefully. He spoke earnestly. I was worried about whether my entire family, young and old, more than twenty people, would be able to go at that time. Dafu said: You have your own means of transportation, what are you worried about? That night, we stayed together at the Longshan Inn. The next day, I sent him on his way, and we said goodbye with great care. Who knew that this farewell would become a final farewell. Alas!</p>
<p>Dafu left behind four sons and one daughter: son Mou, daughter Jiemin, grandchildren Sun Shi Shan, Sun Yangchun (Fei), Dianchun (Yun), Jianchun, from the Wang family. Yangchun is studying at Shanghai Middle School, living in the home of Mr. Chen Gongqia. Jianchun is still staying with a certain lady in Fuzhou, and the rest live in Fuyang, raised by the Sun family.</p>

<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>I traveled here seven years ago</p>
<p>Rubble, desolate smoke, old plank door, I haven't seen it for seven years, but it still exists. Talented people dress up sadly in their old age, good dreams of spring travels are hard to relive. Little crows suspiciously come and go. Autumn flowers seem to silently speak, walking and forgetting the east-west road, still the slanting sun warms half a wall!</p>
<p>Flute and zither are even more abandoned, jade case and golden knife, thoughts not forgotten; attaching a bit of affection, the sky also grows old, leaving a thousand years of traces, the land can grow long. Cold frost doesn't care that the monk's heart is white, the chrysanthemum by the fence is especially yellow because of people; everything before you is mostly overlooked, suspicious clouds and rain are only ordinary.</p>
<p>Meeting Tiansheng on the Lake</p>
<p>Wearing a tilted hat south of the city, not like the old times, holding hands in the west wind, why so late. Over the years, the atmosphere of war, the wild goose has no news, today my worried heart knows. Such autumn scenery, the sky is also beautiful, there are many partings and sorrows, my stomach shares the same feelings. Today, the wine custom is broken for you, but I lack Tao Yuanming's chrysanthemum half a fence.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Suffering <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Every day, I only know to go out early and return late, rushing to get on the bus. I have never felt anything about the so-called "panic buying" of supplies on the market. Although I have indirectly heard others talk about it, I am not interested. But after all, people are social animals. I don't ask about social affairs, but social affairs still come to trouble me.</p>
<p>I was taking advantage of the Double Ten Festival that day to buy a suit, but unexpectedly, after walking to Sichuan Road, I found that nine out of ten shops were closed to "celebrate." I couldn't buy a suit that day. Okay, I'll buy it on the 12th, when there's nothing to celebrate. But when I went to Wusong Road, where there are the most suit shops, full of hope, I was greatly disappointed again; there were suit "shops," but there were no "suits." Were there? But they were just some tattered clothes. The boss also had a sullen face and was displeased. So, I had to "see what I saw and leave."</p>
<p>What to do? Fortunately, I still know a little about military strategy and know how to adapt to circumstances. Since I can't buy a suit, I'll change my plan and make a Zhongshan suit—isn't it natural and right for Chinese people to wear Zhongshan suits? So, I immediately "rushed" to Nanjing Road, "squeezed" into a woolen shop, and "relied" on my national ID card to "snatch" three yards of uniform wool.</p>
<p>That's right, three yards of uniform wool is enough to make a Zhongshan suit, but when it was sent to the tailor shop, the problem came again: the feather gauze for the lining, which the tailor shop usually had, is now gone. Since the problem has come, it must be solved. The solution is to buy it yourself. Who knew that after running to more than forty shops yesterday, I couldn't buy an inch of feather gauze; even holding an ID card didn't work.</p>
<p>Then I suddenly realized, needless to say, my share of the material must have been "panic-bought" by others.</p>
<p>I didn't participate in the panic buying this time. Honestly, it wasn't because I didn't have money. Don't look down on me as just a poor teacher, but my school's salary is paid in several months at a time, and there is never any piecemeal delay; I had already received more than 500 gold yuan vouchers in mid-September, which was more than enough to make two or three suits, but I didn't do so, and that's why I suffered.</p>
<p>Why bother? One should work hard in their career. Mr. Sober II's analysis shows that "panic buying" won't "cheapen" anything.</p>
<p>But the panic buyers will say, "If I don't panic buy, others will panic buy. If others empty it out, where will I buy it?"</p>
<p>It's terrible, it's terrible on this kind of thinking. The current situation is what everyone has "thought" into being.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Scramble to Eat <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Jixian</p>
<p>On Sunday, a friend invited me to Da Sanyuan for breakfast. It was already quite late, ten o'clock. It should have already passed breakfast time. Although it was Sunday, it didn't seem like it would be very crowded.</p>
<p>But when I arrived at Da Sanyuan, I couldn't believe that from the ground floor to the third floor, not only were all the seats already full, but there were still crowds of people standing next to them, waiting for the previous guests to make way for the next ones. Just looking at this crowded scene, even the best appetite would be scared away. But I couldn't resist my friend's kind persuasion, and I finally managed to occupy a seat in the crowd with my friend.</p>
<p>After waiting for a long time, the dim sum did not come for a long time. When the waiter appeared in the venue with the order in hand, the diners couldn't wait to distribute them one by one, so they all acted on their own, not picking the good or bad, and snatched them clean.</p>
<p>My friend and I also grabbed and ate some not-so-satisfactory dim sum in this mess. It was almost twelve o'clock when we came out. We didn't eat much, but after this battle, the appetite for lunch had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Just the distorted phenomenon seen in a dim sum meal, the perverted psychology of "eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die!" has been completely exposed!</p>
<h3 id="e128">Dancing is Going to be Banned Again <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tai</p>
<p>I read in the newspaper today that dancing is going to be banned again in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In recent months, the call to ban dancing seems to have been carried out in a wave-like pattern. It was said in March that it would be banned, but nothing more was heard; in June it was said that a lottery would be held for the songs in the dance halls, but nothing more was heard; in September there were rumors that the ban on dancing would really be implemented, but nothing more was heard as before. Now, in December, the saying that dancing will be banned has become a foregone conclusion, and it seems that it will definitely be implemented. Will there be anything more to be heard at that time? No one can say for sure.</p>
<p>I never dance. But I am really interested in the ban on dancing - not because this matter involves women, but because I think our officials are really "easy to play with." At first, they decided to ban it in a dignified manner, and even ignored the local authorities' request to postpone it, seeming to have the spirit of definitely implementing orders. However, after a disturbance at the Shanghai Social Bureau, the order to ban dancing was left unissued. It is said that in order to take care of the livelihoods of those employees who have always engaged in malpractice, the government's prestige is slightly wronged. It is also the heart of the benevolent. The government should take the people's livelihood issues as the first priority. However, now it is going to be banned again! We want to ask? Is there any determination this time? Ban dancing or not, we have no opinion in principle—we only want to know one thing: will we repeat the same tiger-headed and snake-tailed mistake as last time?</p>
<p>If you want to ban it, ban it completely, and don't let all the dance halls still be full of singing and dancing as before next March and June. If this time it is just a set of official clichés again, then although the "official style" of the "article" will not be reduced from previous years, the topic of the "article" will inevitably be stale!</p>
<h3 id="e129">Scholar and Official <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>"Learning to serve" is the most misleading saying. And "useless learning" is the most likely to mislead oneself.</p>
<p>For example, Hu Shi studied the two family scandals of Ouyang Xiu in a serious manner. We cannot say that this is not "learning", but what is the "use"? Gao Benhan studied the differences in grammar between the ancient Chinese books "Zuo Zhuan", "Guo Yu", "Book of Documents", "Book of Songs", and "Zhuangzi". We cannot say that it is not "learning", but what is it "used" for? As for Einstein's theory of relativity, what "use" has it ever had? According to the rule of "learning to serve", Einstein's academic research must be related to the construction of the atomic bomb, and only then can it be said to be practical.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese academics have always emphasized the practical aspects. For example, Chinese thinkers and philosophers, not to mention the Confucians, even the Taoists and Yin-Yang schools, when talking about "Tao" and "Taiji", all centered on personnel and politics. There are not many theoretical studies that purely target the natural world.</p>
<p>I guess that in people's minds, the meaning of the two words "serving" is not as broad as the literal interpretation. Most people think that "learning excels" and one will inevitably become an "official". "Serving" probably only refers to the word "official". Therefore, deep in most people's hearts, they think: If you don't become an official by learning, then why bother learning? If you can't become an official by learning, then it can be seen that your learning is not excellent enough. And there is a common saying that "doing official work for thousands of miles is only for wealth", then the meaning of the two words "serving" is further reduced to refer to "being useful to oneself". Based on this, even if Edison is as keen on "serving" as he is, if he was born in our country, he must set up his own factory to manufacture light bulbs and phonographs, etc., and make a fortune, and then he can be admired and praised as great. Otherwise, he is just a nosy fool. Because in our country, just doing things that benefit others will not arouse our admiration. What we admire is: a person can greatly find a way to benefit oneself.</p>
<p>Today's scholars have fallen sharply in social status and are quite despised. I have always thought about the reason. If it is because today's scholars are poor? However, the "poor scholars" of the past were not scorned. And there have never been many "rich scholars". I guess that the "scholars" of the past were respected because they could become "officials"; the scholars of today are despised, simply because becoming an "official" today does not necessarily require a "scholar". Originally, whether in the past or today, no one has ever been respected simply because he is a scholar. I privately think that the respect of the past was respected incorrectly, and the contempt of today is contemptible incorrectly.</p>
<p>Lin Yutang said in "The Biography of Su Dongpo": China has always suffered from an overabundance of official talents. Chinese people think that "learning excels" and not becoming an official is an incredible thing, which has led to the phenomenon of "too much monk porridge". If this kind of thinking does not change, then simply the result of popularizing education is enough to destroy China. Because the government can never place 450 million "official talents", and so on. Indeed. However, Lin did not know something: today's people's view of "scholars" has long been changed. It must be known that today's "academics" are not necessarily "academic officials", let alone "Dragon Diagram Pavilion Academics". And even if a "scholar" can become an "official", the profit is not great. Today's civil servants are known to the world for their meager treatment. Therefore, among relatives and friends, there are many who abandon their studies and engage in business when their circumstances allow them to continue their studies. Because there is no profit to be made from reading, why bother being looked down upon? According to this trend, our country does not have the danger of too much education being popularized. We can rest assured.</p>
<p>What is feared is: the people's solid light "scholar" and heavy "official" heart still follow the old habits. In this way, scholars will inevitably decrease or even disappear, but official talents will still increase greatly. If this is really the case, then the way to solve the problem cannot only rely on trying to prevent the popularization of education.</p>
