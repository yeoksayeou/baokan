<h3>如何節省物資？</h3>
<p>調　供求，其方法與理財一樣，一方面要增加生產，另一方面要節省消費。前者屬於開漂性質，是積擭的；後者屬於節流性質，是消極的。儘管治標治本不同，功用相異，但要求產銷相符，民生日用不至匱乏，自非分道並進，雙管齊下不爲功。</p>
<p>現在對於增加生產這一點，大家都很注意，如開放自備外匯的進口貨，增撥外匯，購辦原料，疎通貨運，聯合採辦等，　樞努力，都是朝着這方向走去；只須認定目標，切實進行，相信種種困難，不難分別克服，而使逐漸萎縮中之生產事業，複飾於正常。</p>
<p>至於消費方面，自去年提倡節約運動以來，繼以勤儉建國運動。關於這一方面的許多措施，本在力謀推動之中。最近各地發生搶購現象，物資稀少的情形，日益顯著，於是限制購買，節省消耗的方案，此倡彼和，比前更爲積極。其利害得失情形，頗足資我人探討，今分別闡述如下：</p>
<p>（一）禁止售賣　其已實仃者，如（一）禁售輸入之洋酒，海參，魚翅，及尼隆絲襪；（二）酒菜館不許新設；（三）筵席之限價限額；（四）减少汽車，節約汽油；（五）禁止以米麥釀酒等。其尙在擬議中者，如（一）週五之棻止肉食；（二）各種奢侈品之禁售；（三）不食鷄蛋，改食鴨蛋。內地並有人主張，公務員應悉穿布衣，不許服用絲　等。這許多項目，如果眞能同德一心，普　實行起來，其於物資之節約，與儉樣之養成，其效益自非淺尠。可惜有許多都市，熱視無諸，根本沒有這一回事；而在奉令實施的地方，所有洋酒，魚翅，海參，與豐　的筵席，亦仍到處可以看到，其結果不過使公家减少一部份的稅收，而商民則平添若千作弊的手續而已。我們舉出這些事實來，並不是對於這項原則有所懷疑，不過要實行節約，禁止銷售，則在執行的技術上，顯然還要加以甚大的注意和改進。</p>
<p>（二）擴大記給　配給的作用甚多，而剷除浪費，和節制消耗；乃其重要目的之一。各國實施配給，往往在物資匱乏，食用不足之秋，而一到生產旺盛，衣食無虞，便毅然加以取消，這便是很明顯的例子。不過要配給發生良好的作用，總須配合得上幾個條件；（一）時間要經久；（二）分配要普；（三）所配的物品，要勉强够用。否則黑市難免要發生。且以日用不足之故，民衆或搶購存儲，商人又隱匿拒賣，轉使勉可供應的貨物，憑空缺少起來，這顯然不是辦理配給的初意。所以每一種物品的配給，務要把握住相當的物資及其來源，使大家有恃無恐，不會意識到後繼的爲難，和起碼用量的不足，而後基礎方纔穩固，經辦的人，纔不會發生意外的困難。</p>
<p>（三）憑證購買　憑國民身份證限額准購的現行辦法，在發生檢購時，似是一　很好的應付手段，但也不無缺點·第一，有許多供應大衆的商舖，如旅館·飯館之類，它需要大量的消費品，不是憑證可以購得到的·例如食油一項，因爲必須憑證　買之故，“來這類商舖，就碰到非常的困難。第二，誘致許多不必要的競買·在平常時候，他們並不一定要買，尤其不必人人要買，而在憑證限額准購的時候，或許會意識到，這是一種應享的權利，便不願輕易放棄，又會聯想到物資眞個缺乏，姑且買來儲存，以備不時之需，這豈不要增加貨物的銷路？第三，本地的市民，尙有一部份，並未領到身份證，而外來的旅客，沒有携帶這項證件，或本來沒有這項證件的，爲數亦不在少·第四，身份證而積有限，當初本沒有作爲准購證的準備。如果繼續沿用下去，或擴充到其餘物品，必將無充分的餘地堪以蓋戳，及塡註日期。因此，這項憑證購貨的辦法，我們認爲：只好作爲臨時應付的手段，不宜持久，更不宜擴大應用。</p>
<p>總而言之，節省消費，原是大家應當遵行的原則，至於如何有效地推行？在技術上，尙待切實研討，尤其是治本的工作，卽增加生產，必須加緊實施，使供求不至過於脫節，而後人心安定，搶購自然消滅。其與增加生產，可以相輔而行的，尙有疏導來源這一着。我們以爲目前發給採米證的辦法，倒不妨擴大運用·現在上海區的經管範團，已擴充到四省兩市，至少在這個區域以內，一切貨物的交流；除必要的限制以外，當可使其暢通。故油·柴·雜糧及其他各項原料，在必要時，似可由督導處直接核發採購證，以减少其採運上的阻力，卽以增加本市物資的供應量‘</p>

<h3>吳蘊初招待參觀三廠　主要原料水與空氣　電力限制發展困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工集家吳蘊初氏昨招待新聞界參觀其創辦之天利淡氣廠，天原電化廠，及天野味精廠。記者於瀏覽各廠設備及目續生產過程之後，深感當此經濟破產工業凋敝之秋，該三廠能在困難理境下，增加生產，且力求發展，實屬難能可貴。吳氏以發明味精聞於世，而其實業重心則在於天利及天原兩廠，前者製造氧氣，硝酸，阿摩尼亞，後者製造鹽酸，漂白粉，燒碱，均爲化學工業之重要出品·該兩廠地址均在北新涇附近，抗戰時一部份機器西遷，大部份設備被燬。戰後復員困難重重，天原電化廠於本年春復工，天利淡氣廠則　時三載，於最近始恢復至造。淡　廠用新式之高壓機器，以空氣中之淡氣及水爲原料，先製成阿摩尼亞，再製出濃度達百分之九十八之硝酸，爲國內僅有之濃縮硝酸製造廠，目前阿摩尼亞產量日約一噸餘，可　硝酸四噸多，　氣日　二百餘　（類客量六立方公尺）惟此項產量尙未及戰前二分之一·因受電力限制所致，如全部機器開足，每月用電約需二千餘瓩，而電力公司衹能供應八百瓩，生產乃大受影響。天原電化廠用電解食鹽法，每月可製造燒碱四百五十噸，濃鹽酸三千穴百箱，漂白粉四千箱，最近並在興建一最新式之廻旋式製漂白粉高塔。天廚味精廠以麵筋等爲原料，每月可出味精四百餘噸。吳氏認爲基本化學工業之原料，因主要均取之於自然界之空氣及水，故並無問題，惟電力不數，甚爲困難。如電動力之來原燃煤能源源供應，則在煤，空氣，水三者配合之下，化學工業大可發展云。</p>

<h3>一般物價　在動盪中求出路</h3>
<p>新經濟方案實施以來的上海市塲，眞是驚濤駭浪，幾經滄桑；但是說到市况蕭條，交易淸稀，上週要算在數的了。上週奉令或公開停市的，計有紗布，麵粉，油，餅等多種，其餘陷於半停或表面未停，事實上已停者，更是不可勝數。在另一方面，關於限價的措施，一面有當局重申加强維持的表示，一面有必要時予以調整之說。我們再從游資看市塲，上週週初週中銀根鬆濫之極，據估計壅塞約達十億元之數，暗息曾低見一分。北資南流，而華南經管當局，又限制携現入境，不得超過千元。華西管制較鬆，渝蓉一帶，暗息高站十二元至十四元之譜，於是又形成資金西流的現象。總之，目前的經濟，已到了一個動盪的局面，維持限價，固有種種的困難，放棄限價，前途更是渺茫，議論紛紛，其中具有色彩而爲自己立塲說話的也是不少。希望賢明的當局，要能拿定主意，認淸目標，不可自亂步驟</p>
<p>上週經管方面的重要措施，首推原料供應問題解決，滬區物資調節委員會會議，通過工業原料供應辦法如次：（一）工業原料，應就供應來源分爲：（甲）全部取給國內，（乙）全部取給國外，及（丙）一部份取給國內，但供應不足部份仍須取給國外等三種，俾易籌劃供應及分配。（二）取給國內之原料：（甲）有專管機關者，由專管機關統籌。（乙）無專管機關者責成同業公會供應。（丙）無專管機關及同業公會者，商由中央信託局進行採購。（三）取給國外之原料，應以儘量不增加政府外匯支出爲原則，並由輸出入管理委員會速將第五第六兩季限額完成分配手續，以利輸入。（四）關於分配問題，除棉花燃料及輸入原料之分配，均有專管機關外，其餘尙無分配機關之原料，擬由工會蒐集資料，擬定分配辦法，送由物資調節委員會核轉經濟管制督導員核准施行。（五）各分配機關，雖均自有其隸屬關係，但爲統籌調節起見，必須將各項物資之產銷等數字，按期報吿調節委員會，俾能明瞭全局，此項按期塡報之表格，擬由本會秘書與各機關洽定辦理。（六）各廠商現存原料若干，亟應明瞭，由社會局辦理登記。</p>
<p>在上項辦法通過後之第三日（十五日）據經管處發言人稱：「（一）本處爲求工業原料供應充份起見，決定除國行現規定之配額外匯外，現由國行支付美金二千萬元，交中信局，委託向國外訂購各種工業原料。（二）近查本市進口商方面，有囤積原料情事，昨日督導員辦公處召進工商同業公會負責人，限於三日內，將最近三個月進口貨單開列詳表，呈督導員備查，並令各項原料，均照八一九限價配售各廠。」</p>
<p>關於本市食米供應問題，土週到貨稀少，上等貨絕跡，僅中次貨略有交易。蔣督導員爰召見米業方面重要份子萬墨林，朱永明等談話，決定（一）採購食米如遇困難，經管處可隨時解決，（二）採購商所需之採購證，改由督導員辦公處蓋戳發給，（三）以本市之食糖興總布交換外埠食米·</p>
<p>關於日用必需品全面配給制度之實施，當局頗具決心，經決定自下月份起，先行配給米，油，　，布，煤五種，然後再擴展至其他物品，卽將舉辦全市戶口總普查，重發身份證，另附配購證，以爲實施配給制度之凖備。</p>
<p>關於市塲管制方面，上週蔣督導員曾召集棉紗，棉布，米，棉花，呢絨，綢緞，紙烟，西藥，橡膠，紙，雜糧，食油，食糧，蔬菜，毛絨，百貨，絲織等十七單位批發商代表，聽取陳述營業上之困難，當由蔣氏表示，限價必需遵守，絕不容黑市存在。此外社會局將舉辦第二期日用品存貨登記，規定應登記者爲食糖，肥皂，毛絨綫，火油，木炭，木柴，黃豆等七種。</p>
<p>據國行表示，政府爲引導游賢，促進生產起見，在不增加通貨發行之原則下，准許發行公司債，透過銀行組織，以運用於生產途徑。是項公司債，擬先就資源委員會所屬各廠礦試辦着手，由國家行局承購，再轉售於人民。國行兪總裁復於週四邀集本市各銀行負責人李銘，王志莘等商討，由各銀行組織銀行團，承銷公司債，將來並辦理生產貸款。至國營公司債發行辦法，聞已由資源委員會中央銀行會同擬定，卽可提出政務會議通過，於短期內開始公佈發行。</p>
<p>貨幣金融</p>
<h3>業外銀根仍鬆弛　業內頭寸轉俏歛</h3>
<p>上週本市銀根，就業外來說，仍因交易淸淡，需單稀落，而呈鬆弛，但就一般而言，因某帮吸取，已不再如前週之奇濫。就業內來說，自週三起，銀根鬆勢忽見减斂，行莊方面，多單已不若過去普遍，同業拆放轉盛，惟因供源充裕，週轉至感靈便。按本市游資，至前週週末，壅積量已達七八億元以上，此次銀根得稍見轉穩，在「八一九」以後，亦屬首次。考其原因，不外下列戰點：第一，太市以外各埠，一般多呈現銀根緊斂暗息高昂的局面，其間猶以成渝等地爲甚，這對於本市游資，未始不是一種誘力，一週來資金所以急劇外流，當以此爲生因，據估計每日外流之資金在一二百萬元至五百萬元之間，與根之轉穩，得助亦不少。第二，中國交通兩行開放商業行莊月息二分之活存帳戶，多單者又添一出路。聞連日來此項活存已達二千萬元之譜，第三，平津等地暗息昂達三角左右，當局又規定北方資金匯款分期提支，以致資金南流者較前减少。第四，短期庫券，繼續出售，至上週週末，總額已達一億金元以上，又投資於房地產之資金，自「八一九」迄今，爲數亦已一億餘元，對銀根之收斂，亦不無小作用可言。第五，行莊增資辦法已芷式公佈，增加了業內對資金的需求。</p>
<p>至於現鈔一項，上週內亦較前短絀，這是因爲資金的外流，有一部份係採取運現之故，報載日來有人搜吸五十與百元的金圓券，可能與運現一事有關。</p>
<p>國家行局的交換差額，雖經當局禁止公佈詳細數字，但據悉上週週二交換差出之鉅，竟創改幣後的新紀錄，週三週五兩天，雖因配布收款及同業存款等收入，國家行周竟一反九月九日以來之先例，反出爲進，但進數不能算鉅。至於外商銀行，自週一至週五，仍一致差進。商業行莊，週三週四均員差出，週三出數，更高達六百餘萬元之譜，這當然也是銀根帶俏的現象之一。</p>
<p>說到市塲暗息，在業內銀根轉斂的局面下，亦一致趨升，例如週二不過做二分與四分之間，但週三以後，大致已升到六分半了，至週五甚至還有昂至九分的。又較長期利率，據悉竟高在二角以上，聞係專以此項頭寸轉運渝蓉等地國利者。</p>
<p>上週本市商業行莊內匯匯率，在資金匯出超過匯入的局面下，尙無更動。廣州匯水仍爲廿四元，但央行已限止廣州匯款每筆僅五千元，以制止資金大量南流，厦門匯水爲二十元，漢口長沙重慶貴陽昆明等地之匯水各爲十二元，平津匯水則爲五元。</p>
<p>上週外匯匯率，官價如舊，銀樓業買賣金飾已停止，香港黃金價格，向低處盤旋，週一每華兩金價爲三百十八港元，週二跌二元，週三再降至三百十四元五角，週四則低縮至三百〇九元七角五分，香港美匯前週起一度回漲，據說原因之一爲某銀行在港大量套購美匯，原因之二則爲本市資金南流競買所促成。上週香港美元市價自週一至週三穩定於五元三角一分之高盤，惟週四價忽見軟，僅做五元二角八分，</p>
<p>工商動態</p>
<h3>原料供應問題如何解決？</h3>
<p>近旬日以來，在風起雲湧的物資搶購狂潮中，如何擴大原料之供應，已成爲當前工商界亟待解決的重要課題之一。華東社消息，某工業鉅子對疏導原料一節曾作二點建議性的表示：（一）國內無法生產之各種原料，應盡量讓其輸入，輸入限額可應其需要而增加，付出之外匯部份，以出口結匯及僑匯所得爲主，並將目前中央銀行及各代收行莊所得之外匯，撥出補充。（二）國內能生產之各種原料，其產區之售價，必需嚴加平抑，農村中亦多囤積居奇之富戶，亦宜詳加檢查後，勒令出售，此外再將各廠所需之原料數量，統籌審核分配。以上二點，可以代表工商界對疏導原料問題的一部份看法。</p>
<p>但民間的意見能否獲得許准，仍頗有問題，例如上海區物資調節委員會曾於十二日上午舉行會議，對工業原料供應及日用品調節問題討論甚詳，然而其間關於輸入國外原料的決議，仍決定以儘量不增加政府外匯支出爲原則，對於輸入限額，亦僅決瑛由勵出入管理委員會速將第五第六兩季限額完成分配手續，而並無放實的跡象。</p>
<p>政府規定的輸入限額，在不增加外匯支出的原則下，旣已無法放寬，則問題的焦點必然轉到自備外匯上。按自備外匯可充物資原料的輸入者，大致有三個來源，第一爲國人所持有的外匯頭寸，但目前大部已爲政府收兌，第一爲僑資採取物資形態的輸入，十六日行政院臨時會議雖已通過僑資申請輸入辦法，但辦法中大部係針對生產器材的輸入者，關於原料之輸入，辦法第四條規定僅以申請人自用並不超過生產所需六個月之用量者爲限，在這個規定下，一般不兼「華僑」身份的普通工商家自然就沒有份了。卽以兼有「華僑」身份的工商家言，在目前這個局面之下，是否願冒風險作六個月限量的原料輸入，也是頗有問題的，報載：「僑資輸入申請案件，日來輸管會接獲極少。」諒不是偶然的。最後第三個自備外確的來源，當然就是出口商的結匯了。換句話說，只有力求輸出結匯之增加，才能要求擴大原料的再輸入，但這一希望亦因「最近出口貨以內地行情不一，商人購運困難，對推廣輸入爭取內匯，頗成問題」而感到渺茫。再者，十六日行政院政務會議雖曾通過已付貨款之國外訂貨申請輸入淸理辦法，但是項輸入之淸理，不但只限於「八「九」以前業已付款訂購之貨物，而且必須以「中央銀行外幣外匯存款支付辦法」所規定准許轍入者爲限，可見對於擴大原料輸入以濟燃眉之急一點，亦難有顯著的功效。</p>
<p>國外原料的大量輸入旣成問題，國內原料的擴大供應，又因限價政策的無法澈底而雜以樂觀。這是一個淺顯的道理，一方面要堅守「八一九」防綫，另一方面却在源源製造游資與大量收購產區物資，結果城鄕物價倒懸，原料來路不斬自斷，可見旬日以來原料供應的所以萎縮，並不單純是一個原料問題，而是整個經濟政策政個政治問題的一環而已。</p>
<h3>院校經費分配比例　敎部說明下半年度標準　提高研究設備費須視國家財源</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國立大學經費之分配比例，戰時用於員生薪膳者，佔五成弱。用於研究設備者，佔五成强。目前員生費佔八成，僅二成用於研究設備，一般設備均感簡陋。月前敎部曾召開大學校長座談會，提請改善，以六成用於薪膳，四成用於研究。（已誌本報）此項建議不啻將目前各大學經費增加百分之四十左右，關於其進展情形極爲各方所注視。</p>
<p>茲據敎部負責方面聲稱：國立各院校經費，可列爲五項，茲先將下半年度分配標準，略述於後：（一）經常費先以各院校系科之性質折合點數，再照各院校應得之點數與學生人數而列之。（二）建築設備擴充改良費，照各院校應得之點數與實際需要而列之。（三）臨時事業費根據各院校本年下半年度持殊需要而列之。（四）員工生活費自本年八月份起，改發金圓，生活費係由國庫按照預算員工名額照核定支給標凖撥發。（五）公費生獎學金生膳費，依各院校該項學生人數，與各區核定標準發給。（一）（二）（三）三項卽用於研究設備者，（四）（五）兩項卽用於員生薪膳者。但各院校亦以員工名額學生人數之多寡，原有設備之優劣，及所在地區，而情形各異，故卽以本下半年度經費而論，員生薪膳之費用與研究設備費用之分配比例，亦不盡相同，與戰前各佔五成相比擬，則更懸殊。敎部對於該項建議，正擬邀請專家詳細研討，若一且卽將研究設備費用，改爲四成，因敎部之無其他財源，勢必增加國家總歲出。是以該項改善，必須依國家之財力與總稅收之多寡，而逐漸改善。如能在短期內實現，敎部當全力以赴。</p>

<p>靑白先攻，七分鐘時，小費傳中，阿福一頂，頂入洗伯銘手中。此後全是靑白攻勢，羣力腹地，時遭蹂躪。廿分鐘，林紹鈞邊關起義，姜閻淸絆人犯規，孫漢興主罰十二碼，爲黃仕傑撲出，博得四座掌聲。嚴士鑫易出伏迺堂，至四十分鐘時，祿生帶球，沿邊深入，小羅傳阿福，略不遲疑，一撇進門，伯銘撲住，球已進白綫，上半時靑白一比〇佔先。</p>
<p>兩陣重圓，靑白未有更選，羣力以兪振岳陳來發易出金家聲，余木森。接戰五分鐘，小顧帶球深入，交與小費，近門射進，二對〇又建一功。半小時後，小費傳小顧，阿福舉足一叩，直搗黃龍，三—靑白淨勝三球。羣力爲挽回頹勢，將兪振岳林紹鈞互易，仍未見起色，小顧又陷一城，但以越位不訂。時間終了前。羣力姚李華單騎刦營，黃仕傑撲空，幸孟義良在後一脚。銀笛長鳴，靑白以三球取勝羣力。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>憶達夫</h3>
<p>— 祝枕江</p>
<p>達夫生無歲數可稽，死無年月可考，這正和朱目淸所謂文人不願塡履歷表的說法相暗合。然而天地是萬物的逆旅，光險是百代的過客，在短短的一生之間，祗要足以自慰而又能慰人，這就於願已足了。至於一般人的對於生年死月只恐記之不周，而認爲交際上的惟一要道，這畢竟是小丈夫之所爲，不足以語雅人逸土。而達夫的爲人，的確不是拘拘爲仁孑孑爲義的人物。他對於一切的一切，都以爲逢塲作戲，而未嘗澈底加以考究。就是他自己的年齡若干，也沒有讓他的後人弄個淸楚。至於書籍的冊數，他竟說有五百萬卷之多。如果如此，我想杭垣的書賈決不會不知道的。可是我從未聽到過他們談起達夫的藏書。</p>
<p>不錯，達夫的確有購書癖的。當我們同住在東京一家旅館中的時候，他常在裏神保町舊書舖裏抱了幾冊書本回來，說是他今天又買到許多好書。書的好壞當然因人因時因地而不同。所以我常和他說這都是你的好書。至於購了許多書後，讀不讀却是另一問題了。</p>
<p>我和達夫的認識，是在民二投考東京第一高校預科的那天。他的坐位正在我的前面，而在我後面的是徐祖正。結局在八九百名的考生中，取了三十二名。我和達夫都考取文科。後來又和他寄宿在一起。他嘗和我說起，他已定了婚，是由他哥哥郁華作主的。而他當時的年紀約莫小我二三歲或一二歲。如果有人問我今年的年紀幾何，作爲達夫年齡的考證，我當說若有百歲遐齡，則我已過了一半以上。假使要引證七十古來稀的話，那末達夫也不算短命而死，而我今日也已在前綫上了。</p>
<p>我常和達夫有一致的行動。我們曾認文科的空虛，不如轉入醫科爲可靠。嗣經轉科的考試，我們都成爲醫科學生了。自從高預畢業之後，他入五高，我入四高；他進京大，我進九大；彼此相見的機會極少。而善於轉變的他，又由醫科改入經濟科了。</p>
<p>我和他離日之後，遇到的次數也不多。有一次在上海一家旅館中看見他和沫若躺在床上，說是你來得很巧，正可看看我們今日的生活。這正是他們忙於寫作的時代，文人落魄的時代，也正是他們的「創造」時代。此後偶然在上海電車中見了他一次。他說近來身體欠佳，恐怕患的是肺病。我由他憔悴的面容上，也已窺出他所患的是慢性病症，而少年時代的英氣，早爲暮氣所籠罩着了。可是由他善變的性情上，還有幾分早年的風度留存着。他吿訴我他的家在北平，正想去看看他的妻子。而同時我也未便問他一個人有了二重生活，是否足以殺伐其身心。</p>
<p>達夫使我最不能忘懷的，是和他在宿舍中的時期。當我們上了夜踝之後，常想蹤出校外去吃些東西。可是門禁森嚴，不能越雷池一步。於是冒險由邊門上逃出，飽食之餘，再帶幾個生鷄蛋在袋中，復由邊門上翻入。我們回到宿舍中，正想摸出鷄蛋來的時候，呀，天地玄黃早變成宇宙洪荒了。當彼此的兩手染着蛋黃的時候，在同學面前始終不敢稍露些聲色，而祗作楚囚相對。</p>
<p>我回憶着當時的情况，髣髴達夫現在還在我的面前閃耀着。但是這已經是三子多年前的事了。噫，達夫！</p>
<h3>淸平樂</h3>
<p>— 顧飛</p>
<p>醒來如醉，紗碧遮愁斷，枕上離魂飄更遠，夢只添成憔悴。小燈淡暈紅霞，小窗輕轉銀芽，移却窗前明鏡，鏡中人似黃花。</p>
<h3>詠母忘儂花</h3>
<p>香入雪花千點冷，光浮明月一溪淸，自來開落無拘管，何用痴人苦寄情。</p>
<h3>美國郵政新猷</h3>
<p>— 聰之</p>
<p>美國郵政部最近擬議發行一種「特快郵票」，票面二角。其主要作用在代替目前流行的「航快」一角八分的郵票。凡貼用「特快郵票」者，寄信人不必指明須用何種方式寄遞，而由郵局的專家們代爲規劃一條最快的路綫，務使這封信比平常須等候班機的航快信可以更快抵達。</p>
<h3>獨酌</h3>
<p>— 雨窗</p>
<p>瓶裏寥寥幾朶菊花，似乎已有漸漸凋零的意思，却還是朱紅暗綠，掩映生姿，花瓣邊緣上一絲金綫，更像是那些朱漆的茗碗外面漆着一條工細的金色蛟龍，那樣的紅，那樣的綠，再加上這一條條夭矯的金黃，構成了一幅强烈的富於東方色彩的圖畫。</p>
<p>花下有兩三隻碟子，一壺溫溫的好酒。桌上左邊有一太我喜歡讀的書。我一杯慢慢的喝着。有時，爲了反覆沈吟一首詩，我忘棹了飲酒；有時，爲了細品酒味，或者爲了憧憬於那些菊花所給我的無數聯想，我忘掉了那本書。詩篇裏充滿了美麗的景色；滿天絢爛的雲霞；遍山蓋野的在風中搖曳的小小的野花；年靑人在黑夜中輕輕叩門，在火柴光的一閃中看見了開門的正是那個他所心愛的少女……菊花也帶給我無數夢境：那些遺忘了的一笑一顰，正像徐徐升向晴空的一樓炊烟，滿心以爲已經消失，一轉眼却又隱約出現了。</p>
<p>一片寂靜。燈光下，小小的房間似乎比白天更小，更溫暖了。我默然舉杯，我覺得這一剎那才完全是我自己的。我不必像在大庭廣衆間似的刻留神，受盡拘束；我更不必勉强陪伴那些纏繞不休儘嚷「乾杯」的惡客；一切都自然而然，要喝就喝，要住就住。穿一件舒服的舊夾襖，拖一雙布鞋，一切閒氣付諸腦後，心裘面空蕩蕩，可以讀我生平喜歡讀而又老是沒有工夫讀的好書了。而且，在這時候讀書，正是如倍根所說的「咀嚼」和「消化」，妙義疊出，意象無窮。比之十幾年前在大學裏桌上堆滿參考書和筆記本的讀法，難易旣不相同，意味也就不大一樣。也許，十幾年前的下帷苦讀，就爲的是今天的准備罷？</p>
<p>有時，暫時把書推一推開，欣然舉杯，又這樣想：一天來我盡心盡力地工作，沒有做過奸詐營私的事情，沒有對不起別人的地方。我眼前還有這幾朶艷魔的菊花，杯中還有滿滿的芳馨馥郁的好酒，豈不可喜？心地能得片刻寗靜，也就是無上的淸福了。</p>
<p>靜夜中但聽見窗外蛩聲繞砌。秋色已深，一年又冉再將去。說凄凉罷，誠然也有些凄凉。一年年過去，自已看一切時，總覺意味漸漸淡了。一生就是如此，沒有燦爛的火花，沒有耀目的光芒，衹像江南鄉村一條平平凡凡的小溪，靜靜流過。這溪水並未能像激流一般發出無比的電力，使兩岸的人家普遍地受到它的好處；可是，如果在這小溪的兩旁，也有一叢叢美麗小花，受到了溪水的潤澤，長成起來，那麽，也沒有什麼可以遺憾了罷？</p>
<p>推開窗子，但見寒月當空，風過處，滿園的樹葉都簌簌響了。花瓶裏的菊花悄然掉了一嚮·我又靜靜地擎起了酒杯。</p>
<h3>人皮書</h3>
<p>— 宋賢</p>
<p>法國大革命前，盧騷著「民約論」一畫。大受當時許多貴族的嘲笑，說是該書立論空洞，毫不足道。但這些貴族在革命狂潮中多被送上斷頭台，執行死刑，想不到他們遺體的皮竟被作爲「民約論」封面之用。</p>
<p>大英國博物院圖書館內，藏有一本書，是用一個殺人犯的皮所裝釘的。倫敦麥爾勃祿圖書館內也有兩部書，據說是兩個女巫的皮所裝釘的。</p>
<p>更奇怪的是法國有一位女子，因崇拜天文學家米葉·拉瑪里翁的作品，立下遺囑，願將她死後遺體的皮獻作裝釘這些書本之用。</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>加拿大的魁北克境內，新造鋁質大橋一座，重祗四十萬磅。如果照這座橋的長度用鋼建築，重量須在一百五十萬磅左右。</p>
<p>美國最近盛行一種「玻璃」球（這是「玻璃絲襪」的「玻璃」，卽「可塑體」Plastic），裏面放滿了淸水，再把鮮花放進去，可使外面看時花的形狀擴大，色彩也格外鮮艷。這種球的直徑約七吋，上半部有螺旋，可以開閉。</p>
<h3>雪內苓</h3>
<p>北平有幾種商店，在改幣以後的二十天內，與其說是「搶買」，不如說是「搶賣」，那就是綢緞店，眼鏡鐘表店，百貨店，這些奢侈品多在鬧市通衢，金碧輝煌，老闆及夥計衣冠服用，都不平凡，開銷大，捐稅重，而且一家一家，望衡對宇。北平不是繁華商埠，摩登男女雖有，怎奈供過於求。百貨店雖是投時利器（因爲亦是亮晶晶，香噴噴的常用品），一店得利，多店繼續開張，東西城兩大街，五光十色，好多的百貨公司，百貨店，常常在玻璃窗上貼出「大贈彩」，「特別减價」，甚至「狠啦！」「踐啦！」「請比較誰家眞賤！」等橫七豎八之標語，以求速賣現款，應付開銷。至改幣以後，利用游資多，買主衆之機會，更大開門市，明標價目，且有眼鏡店綢緞店數家，在各報聯合大登廣吿，以「同心協助經改，實遵限價出售」之好題目，以廣招徠。而靑年士女，以及一般以黃白物兌取大宗新劵在手，無處安頓者，乃蜂擁而前。櫃上主人是以「積貨暢銷」爲大快，入門之客以「游資得用」爲樂事，兩兩相需，各得其所，手揮目送，如山陰道上應接不暇，形成空前未有之假繁榮。如是者自八月尾至九月下旬之久，近半月中，始漸减色，正是「冬來薰得花如錦，轉眼將成憔悴姿」，原本不是正常的現象。</p>
<h3>南京即景</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>好容易等了個禮拜天，又是一年一度的國慶佳日，怎樣的肯白白給虛度了？我老早已約了一個新來南京的朋友，上午購物，下午遊燕子磯。那天正是所謂晴空一碧，萬里無雲，我們從鼓樓一逕往新街口走。但見滿街人潮，國旗到處飄揚，南京有的是機關，而每一個機關都或多或少的結了點綵。店家今年也特別的討好，家家關起了門慶祝，好像過年似的。我們一口氣跑到中央商塲（南京最大的商塲），也是鐵門緊拉。大羣的公務員，軍人，小市民都在望門興嘆，好像非用去一點錢不可似的。我們跑過了半個南京，依然兩手空空，而新街口的擴聲機中已傳出了鐘聲十二下。總得先裝飽了肚再說。</p>
<p>南京的小吃是出名的，天津，北平，蘇州，四川，湖南等什麼味兒都有。但最近生意的興隆却常常使老闆們心驚肉跳。我們一走進那家小館子，老闆趕緊向我們作揖：「下回請早！」我們並沒有上他的當，直闖了進去，立在角落裏等着。看見那一席卽將吃的朝天，就趁勢將位子佔了。也幾乎是「半搶」的點了菜，坐了三刻鐘才算飽了口福。坐在我對面的一個小公務員模樣的，一個人點了一大盆花捲，一大　家常飯，兩隻炒菜，一碗片耳湯，不禁使我大吃一驚。他似乎也有些覺得，茫然地說：「有得吃時多吃點不好嗎？」他又指着無數正在埋頭苦吃的人們說：「我並不孤獨啊！」</p>
<p>我們於飽食之餘，悲哀的走出了館子，一逕向江南車站跑。滿想到了燕子磯去寬一寬胸襟，洗一洗那個小公務員的酸梗餘音。到得車站，長蛇陣已經轉了彎，我們只得購了票排在後面。以前，到燕子磯的江南車十分鐘一輛，我想最多三輛，卽可將前面的裝走，因此心安理得的等着。那曉得今非昔比，直等了半個小時，還未見其姍姍來得一輛。虧得有個賣票的吿訴我，說現在到燕子磯車子要一個半小時一輛了。我屈指一算，還要等四個半小時才能上得車子；到了燕子磯，再等四個半小時上車，恐怕回到市區，已是第二天早晨了。于是祗得作罷，拖着疲憊的身子再到電影院去碰碰運氣。</p>
<p>南京一共也只有六個電影院。我們選中了一家開映「文藝」片的，想來看的人或許少一些。不料那家戲院位子少，又可以預售，因此那個售票處的窗子好像變戲法似的，一開一閉，都在頃刻之間，只那麽一會兒，就宣布戲票售罄了。我兩眼看着我的新來南京的朋友，祗好表示無限的歉意。兩個人欲笑不得，欲哭無淚，眞眞的所謂啼笑皆非了。</p>
<p>我們只得在滿是人潮的馬路上毫無目的地蹓躂着。但見暮色漸漸迷濛，夕陽徐徐下沉，忽然想起，假期已經過去了。</p>

<h3>Major Victory for Northeast National Army: Westward Bound Corps Captures Xinlitun, Cutting Off Bandit Army's Retreat with East-West Pincer Movement</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in PanYang on the 17th] Since the westward-bound corps from Shenyang continues to display its power, advancing westward from Banlamen along the Raoyang River in the south and coordinating with the Zhangwu area in the north, after completing the pincer movement against Xinlitun, it launched a surprise attack at dawn on the 17th and captured Daheishan, a vital road west of Xinmin leading to Xinlitun. The advancing troops pressed westward in victory, reaching Xinlitun. After a fierce battle, they recovered Xinlitun, a railway transportation hub held by the bandits, at 11 a.m. this morning. The bandit's 5th, 6th, and part of the 10th Columns suffered heavy losses and fled south towards Heitun, Sijianfang, and other places. The recovery of Xinlitun marks another major victory for the National Army, as Xinlitun is a strategically important location. The Northeast bandit field army consists of twelve columns. Currently, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Columns are in western Liaoning, while the 5th, 6th, and 10th Columns, having been routed in western Shenyang, are fleeing west. With nine columns now in western Liaoning, the National Army can launch an east-west pincer movement to encircle and annihilate them. Now that the bandits' retreat is cut off, it presents an excellent opportunity. It is predicted that a major decisive battle will take place on the banks of the Daling River. The bandit Lin Biao's forces in Jinzhou, with approximately three columns of strength, are attempting to cross the Daling River eastward and return to Beizhen. There are signs of activity in the Goubangzi area, and the air force is currently pursuing and bombing them. The eastward-bound corps from Huludao and Jinxi are still blocked in the Tashan area. The bandits are deploying all their forces in a line south of Gaoqiao, requiring a great effort [to overcome], but the bandits have suffered significant losses. The battles at Fanchegou and Quanyanggou west of Tashan on the night of the 16th inflicted heavy damage on parts of the bandit's 7th and 11th Columns, resulting in the capture of many large-caliber cannons and light and heavy machine guns. Fierce fighting continues east of Tashan on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Shenyang on the 17th] After President left Shenyang on the 16th, Du Yuming immediately went to the front lines in Xinmin and other places to command the operation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Shenyang on the 17th] The Northeast Pacification Headquarters announced that contact with Jinzhou was lost at dawn on the 16th, and the situation is unclear. Another report stated that the air force from various regions played a significant role in the Jinzhou campaign, dropping an astounding number of bombs, undoubtedly inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits. It is rumored that Fan Hanjie, Lu Junquan, and others, during the Jinzhou crisis, broke through the encirclement and reached Jinxi to continue directing operations.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Huludao on the 17th] Jinxi held an important military conference today, with all generals ordered to attend. The Liaoxi battle situation is about to unfold with great force, and the morale of the people here is greatly boosted. A unit of the National Army advanced to Shierbao, 12 li northwest of Jinxi, and engaged in fierce fighting with the bandit army. The fighting on the Tashan line was fierce. On the 16th, the National Army, in coordination with the air and naval forces, launched a fierce attack on Siping Mountain near Tashan, firing over 9,000 shells. The National Army captured Tashan on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Huludao on the 17th] Landing craft No. 107, carrying tanks and a large quantity of ammunition, arrived in Huludao on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi National Army Continuously Captures Heyang and Chengcheng; Bandits in Central Henan Commit Crimes in Mixian and Fanshui; Bandit Army Massing in the Suizao Area of Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Xi'an on the 17th] The right-wing corps of the Shaanxi National Army recovered Heyang on the evening of the 16th, advancing in a fan shape. On the 17th, they also occupied Ganjing Town, approximately 30 li directly north of Queyang, and Xushuigou to the northwest, intercepting over 3,000 wounded bandits during the pursuit. The left-wing corps captured Chengcheng on the 16th and occupied Luojiaao on the 17th, crossing the Xi River west of the county and pursuing the fleeing bandits towards Wanggan Town. The National Army is currently advancing into the Huanglong Mountains.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Xi'an on the 17th] Under the National Army's suppression, the remaining bandits in eastern Shaanxi are collapsing northward. Their 2nd and 3rd Columns retreated to the Molang and Zhichuan area south of Hancheng on the 16th, while the remnants of the 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns collapsed to the Zhaozhuang Town area north of Chengcheng, continuing to flee north.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Xi'an on the 17th] Over 2,000 bandits southwest of Pucheng are currently rampaging near Xingshi Town, constructing fortifications. Over 1,000 bandits are entrenched in Meiyuan, northeast of Fuping, recently raiding Liuxi Town and looting food supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 17th] Due to extremely low morale and the National Army's vigorous attacks, the Peng bandits in northern Wei suffered heavy losses and fled north in disarray with their remnants. Most of their 2nd and 3rd Columns have fled back to the Molang and Zhichuan areas northeast of Heyang, while their 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns have collapsed to Zhaozhuang Town and further north. However, the National Army is still advancing triumphantly day and night to achieve complete annihilation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Xi'an on the 17th] The bandit Liu Bocheng's 12th Column and Chen Geng's X Column in central Henan recently invaded Mixian and Fanshui. After being met with resistance, they retreated with injuries. Over 2,000 bandit troops from the 55th, 56th, and 57th Brigades of the bandits in Lushan and Baofeng fled west to Haiguan Yin for reinforcement.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Hankou on the 17th] Military news: A portion of Liu's 6th, 11th, and 12th Columns recently massed in the Suixian and Zao Yang areas of northern Hubei, showing signs of attempting to raid southeast. After being intercepted head-on by the National Army, the bandit's momentum has been thwarted, and fierce fighting is still ongoing west of Yingshan. According to military analysis, although the bandits intend to raid eastward, they may not attack Guangshui. According to transportation sources, Guangshui is currently very peaceful.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Taiyuan Continues</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Xi'an on the 17th] The fighting on the outskirts of Taiyuan can only be seen as the calm before the storm. The bandits' new deployments are very clear. The bandit 4th Column, originally based in Shijiazhuang, and the bandit 10th Column from Linfen are also massing in central Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] Fierce fighting continues in the suburbs of Taiyuan. Fierce battles occurred from the 16th to the morning of the 17th in Nanpingtou, Shizuizi, Heituo, Hanshan southeast of the city, and Qianhou Lijiasan northeast of the city.</p>
<h3>Rehe Strives to Reform Provincial Administration; Grain Protection Work Continues</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Chengde on the 17th] Since the start of the grain protection work, Rehe Province has been rapidly moving towards self-reliance and seeking effective and quick solutions. (1) A large number of provincial government officials are dispatched to work in counties. (2) County officials are dispatched to work in townships, all receiving their original salaries. (3) Cadres in districts, towns, and townships also hold military positions and are trained in batches. (4) Self-defense team members adopt a unified distribution system for public grain, with a minimum of 70 jin per person per month. (5) Thorough implementation of the 25% rent reduction. (6) Preparing to start land reform, with Chengdong Sanliu designated as a pilot area. Secondly, grain protection is still ongoing. Currently, Chengde City has collected 2,100 tons of civilian grain, and Luanping and Gubeikou have also collected 600 tons.</p>

The salary table newly drafted by the Examination Yuan is slightly higher than this.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Explains Ineffective Implementation of Financial and Economic Measures; Executive Yuan Has Responded to the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Nanjing on the 17th] Five members of the Legislative Yuan, including Zhou Jieren, submitted a written inquiry at the end of last month, stating that Guangdong Province Chairman Song Ziwen "ineffectively implemented the emergency measures order for finance and economy, and publicly criticized the new currency system for insufficient preparation, intending to undermine it and take advantage of the opportunity to seek profits. The government did not punish him, and the Legislative Yuan transferred it to the Executive Yuan for response." After the Executive Yuan telegraphed for inquiry, Song submitted a reply by telegraph and responded to the Legislative Yuan a few days ago, stating that the allegations were true and that he is currently recognizing their control. According to Song's explanation, after the currency reform, commodity prices in Guangzhou fluctuated due to the low exchange rate difference with Shanghai and the sharp increase in the exchange value of foreign currencies. However, after he supervised his subordinates to handle the matter separately, re-evaluated commodity prices, inspected merchants who violated price negotiations, cracked down on black market operations, restricted the withdrawal of remittances, strengthened anti-smuggling along the Hong Kong and Macao borders, registered existing goods, and planned to transport supplies to provide relief. At the same time, promoted the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and intensified financial inspections. After various measures, the number of collections was considerable, and commodity prices generally tended to stabilize. Approximately 150 cases were solved through inspection work, and the market is still considered stable, so it cannot be said that the implementation was ineffective. Song also stated: "In the past, I have never made public criticisms of anything in the press." The so-called criticism of the new currency system is a deliberate rumor. As for taking advantage of the opportunity to seek profits, he stated: "It may be a misrepresentation that the Guangdong Provincial Food Management Committee entrusted the Provincial Bank to purchase Hong Kong dollar drafts before the currency change in preparation for paying for the rice allocation amount."</p>
<h3>Investigation of Responsibility for the Fall of Jinan; The Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee Report Lists Seven Points; The Legislative Yuan Meeting Tomorrow Will Discuss Them</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Nanjing on the 17th] The Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee held an expanded meeting on the 29th of last month to review and investigate the responsibility for the defeat in the Jinan battle. Subsequently, a resolution was made to appoint five members, including Wang Jun, to formulate a plan, which was then reviewed and submitted as a report. It has been included in the agenda of the second meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 19th for discussion. It is reported that: It is reported that: The report pointed out that the distant reasons for the fall of Jinan were two: (1) The mistake of the reorganization measures caused the local armed forces in Shandong to be destroyed. (2) The near causes for the fall of Changle and Weixian are six: (1) The operational guidance was not appropriate, (2) Intelligence was inaccurate, (3) Wu Huawen's betrayal, (4) Liao Wenwei's suspicion of colluding with bandits, (5) The new airport was not completed on schedule, and (6) Reinforcements were ineffective. The report finally raised seven points regarding the responsibility for the fall of Jinan: (1) The mistake of reorganization caused the militia to be almost completely destroyed, which has an impact on the fall of Jinan. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (2) The failure to defend Changle and Weixian isolated Jinan. Should Wang Yaowu and the Ministry of National Defense be jointly responsible? The fall of Yanzhou made Jinan an isolated island. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? Should the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Headquarters also bear its share of the blame? (3) The inappropriate operational guidance of the Ministry of National Defense is the most important reason for the fall of Jinan. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (4) Inaccurate intelligence. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (5) Wu Huawen was fickle. Why did the Ministry of National Defense entrust him with important tasks? Wang Yaowu was Wu's direct superior. Why couldn't he learn the details and take precautions? Should the Ministry of National Defense and Wang Yaowu share the responsibility? (6) The construction of the new airport was not completed in time. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (7) Ineffective reinforcement. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible?</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Save Resources?</h3>
<p>To regulate supply and demand is similar to managing finances. On one hand, we must increase production, and on the other, we must conserve consumption. The former belongs to the nature of expanding income and is active; the latter belongs to the nature of reducing expenditure and is passive. Although addressing the symptoms and addressing the root cause are different and their functions differ, if we want production and sales to match, and the people's daily necessities not to be scarce, we must advance on separate paths and not achieve results without working in tandem.</p>
<p>Currently, everyone is paying attention to increasing production. For example, opening up imports of goods with self-provided foreign exchange, increasing the allocation of foreign exchange, purchasing raw materials, streamlining freight transportation, and jointly purchasing goods are all efforts in this direction. As long as we identify the goal and carry it out earnestly, I believe that various difficulties can be overcome separately, and the gradually shrinking production industry can be restored to normal.</p>
<p>As for consumption, since the promotion of the thrift movement last year, followed by the diligent and thrifty nation-building movement, many measures in this regard have been striving to promote it. Recently, panic buying has occurred in various places, and the scarcity of materials has become increasingly significant. Therefore, restrictions on purchases and plans to conserve consumption have been advocated one after another, and are more active than before. The pros and cons of this situation are worthy of our exploration, and are explained separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Prohibiting Sales: Those that have already been implemented include: (1) banning the sale of imported foreign wines, sea cucumbers, shark fins, and nylon stockings; (2) not allowing new restaurants and wine shops to be established; (3) limiting the price and amount of banquets; (4) reducing the number of cars and saving gasoline; (5) prohibiting the brewing of wine with rice and wheat, etc. Those that are still under consideration include: (1) banning meat consumption on Fridays; (2) banning the sale of various luxury goods; (3) not eating chicken eggs, but eating duck eggs. Some people in the inland even advocate that civil servants should all wear cloth clothes and not be allowed to use silk fabrics, etc. If these many items can truly be implemented universally with one heart and one mind, the benefits to the conservation of materials and the cultivation of frugality will naturally be significant. Unfortunately, many cities turn a blind eye and pretend that this never happened. In places where orders are implemented, all kinds of foreign wines, shark fins, sea cucumbers, and lavish banquets can still be seen everywhere. The result is only that the government reduces a part of the tax revenue, while merchants and civilians add some fraudulent procedures. We cite these facts not to doubt this principle, but to point out that if we want to implement frugality and prohibit sales, we must pay great attention to and improve the execution techniques.</p>
<p>(2) Expanding Rationing: Rationing has many functions, and eliminating waste and controlling consumption are among its important goals. Countries often implement rationing when materials are scarce and food is insufficient, and once production is abundant and there is no shortage of food and clothing, they resolutely cancel it. This is a very obvious example. However, if rationing is to have a good effect, it must be matched with several conditions: (1) the time must be long-lasting; (2) the distribution must be universal; (3) the allocated items must be barely sufficient. Otherwise, the black market is bound to occur. Moreover, due to insufficient daily use, the public may rush to buy and store, and merchants may hide and refuse to sell, which in turn makes the goods that can barely be supplied scarce out of thin air. This is obviously not the original intention of rationing. Therefore, for the rationing of each item, it is necessary to grasp the corresponding materials and their sources, so that everyone has no fear and does not realize the difficulty of succession and the lack of minimum usage, and then the foundation is stable, and the people in charge will not encounter unexpected difficulties.</p>
<p>(3) Purchasing with Certificates: The current method of allowing purchases within quotas based on national identity cards seems to be a good way to deal with panic buying, but it is not without its shortcomings. First, there are many shops that supply the public, such as hotels and restaurants, which require a large amount of consumer goods that cannot be purchased with certificates. For example, cooking oil is very difficult to obtain for these types of shops because it must be purchased with certificates. Second, it induces many unnecessary competitive purchases. Under normal circumstances, they do not necessarily have to buy, especially not everyone has to buy, but when purchases are allowed within quotas based on certificates, they may realize that this is a right that should be enjoyed, and they are unwilling to give it up easily. They may also think of the fact that materials are really lacking, so they might as well buy them and store them for future needs. Wouldn't this increase the sales of goods? Third, there are still some local citizens who have not received identity cards, and there are also many foreign travelers who do not carry this document, or who do not have this document in the first place. Fourth, the identity card has limited space. Originally, it was not prepared as a purchase certificate. If it continues to be used or expanded to other items, there will not be enough space to stamp and fill in the date. Therefore, we believe that this method of purchasing goods with certificates can only be used as a temporary means of dealing with the situation, and should not be sustained or expanded.</p>
<p>In short, conserving consumption is a principle that everyone should follow. As for how to effectively promote it, the technical aspects still need to be earnestly studied. In particular, the fundamental work, namely increasing production, must be stepped up so that the supply and demand are not too disconnected, and then people's hearts will be stable and panic buying will naturally disappear. Another measure that can complement increasing production is to dredge the source. We believe that the current method of issuing rice purchase certificates may as well be expanded. The management scope of the Shanghai area has been expanded to four provinces and two cities. At least within this area, the exchange of all goods, except for necessary restrictions, should be made smooth. Therefore, oil, firewood, miscellaneous grains, and other raw materials can be directly issued purchase certificates by the supervisory office when necessary to reduce the resistance in their procurement and transportation, that is, to increase the supply of materials in this city.</p>
<h3>Price Fluctuations and Goods Shortages: Various Places Are Actively Seeking Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] The shortages of rice, flour, oil, and firewood in Zhenjiang have reached the most serious stage. The common people and displaced refugees are on the verge of starvation because it is not easy to buy food. However, because some people are intercepting purchases in the suburbs, villagers dare not enter the city, and the sporadic supply of firewood and rice is also decreasing day by day, and the poor are crying out in pain.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various trade associations on the 17th, chaired by Lu Xiaobo. It was resolved that (1) the Zhenjiang merchants' purchases of yarn, cloth, rice, flour, etc., stored in Shanghai and other places that are being detained, should be counted overnight by the various trade associations, and the county government should be requested to negotiate for their release to the market. (2) The average number of goods imported from January to June of this year should be used as the monthly standard for needs, and sent to the county government for forwarding to Shanghai Supervisor Jiang for distribution. In addition, County Magistrate Xie Bi of this county has already traveled to Shanghai by car tonight to attend the economic inspection meeting to be held at the Central Bank in Shanghai at 9:00 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Wuxi [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] Due to the rush to buy firewood, rice, oil, salt, and flour in the past few days, there is now a shortage of supply. Citizens without rice have switched to eating noodles. The stores have very little stock, so they often open late and close early.</p>
<p>Changshu [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] The black market for various commodities in the rural areas here is rampant. The county authorities have received the news and are trying to stop it. In order to maintain the people's food supply, the police bureau's commodity supervision team has sent personnel to various rice mills and commercial firms to investigate the stored grain in order to verify and handle the matter. At the same time, in accordance with the order from the Wuxi Command Post, the prices of various daily necessities will be based on the prices of various production areas in Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Yushan, Shanghai, and Yixing as the standard.</p>
<p>Hangzhou [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] The black market has been discovered in the silk and other industries in Hangzhou. The inspection team has paid close attention to it. The Economic Brigade of the Provincial Police Bureau has been fully mobilized since the 17th to investigate and ban the black market. In addition, the Fourth Detachment of the Suppression and Construction Corps will come to Hangzhou in the next few days to carry out its work.</p>
<p>Hankou [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] The food shortage and goods shortage in Hankou are becoming more and more serious. The rice stores have sold out of their entire inventory of grain. Cooking oil and yarn cloth cannot be purchased. The provincial and municipal authorities are helpless and have added sesame seeds and cooking oil to the list of items prohibited from being transported out. The Hankou Economic Inspection Team discovered this afternoon that the Anlian ship was transporting more than 6,000 bags of soybeans, peas, sorghum, and sesame seeds. All the goods on the ship have been detained. At the same time, Zou Jizhi, who is famous for trafficking in gold, has been arrested by the Criminal Police Team again.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] It is reported that some unscrupulous merchants in remote rural towns in Hubei Province have recently refused to use Gold Yuan. After receiving the report, the provincial government has issued a notice to all counties to explain and correct this situation.</p>
<p>Kunming [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] The Kunming market has been in a state of complete chaos for the past week. The trend of refusing to sell and panic buying is very strong, and dangerous situations are emerging. The municipal government has specially convened 83 industries in the city to renegotiate prices. The method is to first discuss among the industries themselves and submit them to the municipal government. Finally, the provincial government will review and approve them under the principle of fairness and reasonableness, and promulgate and implement them. It is heard that the prices proposed by the various industries are more than three times higher than the original negotiated prices, and Chairman Lu is carefully considering them.</p>
<p>Ya'an [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] Commodity prices here have fluctuated greatly recently. Due to the impact of panic buying in Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Chengdu, they have risen several times compared with the prices a month ago, which poses a great threat to the general public.</p>
<h3>Rationing in Peiping and Tientsin: Supply Is Guaranteed</h3>

<h3>The New Cabinet Can Be Formed Today; The Social Reform Party Decides to Participate in the New Cabinet; The Minister of Finance and Minister of Health, Etc., Have All Been Tentatively Decided</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] According to reliable sources, the sixth post-war cabinet of Japan, under the leadership of the new Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, is expected to be formed tomorrow. Yoshida spent the night quietly in Oiso yesterday, and is scheduled to return here at noon today. Reliable sources say that even if one or two positions in the new cabinet cannot be assigned in time, the appointment of the heads of the various ministries will be decided tomorrow. Secretary-General of the Democratic Liberal Party, Yashima Shichiro, this morning, on behalf of Yoshida, said that the new cabinet will be dominated by the Democratic Liberal Party, accounting for six-tenths of the positions, as predicted by the Central News Agency earlier last week, and will be supported by a small number of conservative parties and independents. The Social Reform Party has accepted Yoshida Shigeru's invitation to participate in the new cabinet.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the party's secretary, Satake Haru, will assume a certain position in the new cabinet. To date, at least four positions in the new cabinet have been decided: Sato Eisaku has been appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary, Izumiya Sanji will be appointed Minister of Finance, Hayashi Joji (who served as Chief Cabinet Secretary in the first and second Yoshida Shigeru cabinets) will be Minister of Health, and Oya Shinzo will be appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry. The Japanese press reports that Nagata Kiyoshi, a well-known scholar of finance and banking in Japan, will be appointed Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. However, according to our reporter's inquiries from relevant sources, Nagata has refused the invitation to join the cabinet. These sources also said that Yoshida is planning to appoint his advisor, Shuto Hideo, as Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Although Shuto himself is willing to serve as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, most members of the Democratic Liberal Party want him to take on the position of Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. The above-mentioned sources further revealed that some key positions in the new cabinet, such as the Minister of Labor, the Minister of Education, and the Prosecutor-General, may be filled by non-partisan and well-respected individuals.</p>

<h3>Shidehara and Saito to Serve as Advisors to the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Cooperative Party Will Demand the Dissolution of the Parliament</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] The new cabinet under Yoshida will concurrently serve as Foreign Minister. The only feature of the new cabinet is that most of the cabinet members are new faces. This is because Yoshida intends to prevent the appointment of personnel who may be involved in corruption cases in the future. Leaders within the Democratic Liberal Party, such as Shidehara, who had served as Prime Minister, and Saito, who had served as a cabinet member, will not participate in the new cabinet, but will only assist Yoshida as advisors. The Cooperative Party, the fourth largest party in the Diet with thirty seats in the Lower House, has decided to demand the dissolution of the Diet and a new election, in order to reflect the will of the people in the Diet. However, the party declared that the dissolution of the Diet should take place after the Yoshida cabinet urges the current special session of the Diet to pass the revised Labor Law bill prohibiting strikes by civil servants. The revised bill was instructed by MacArthur.</p>
<h3>5,000 Left-Wing Korean Residents in Japan Celebrate the Establishment of the North Korean Regime; Japanese Communist Party and Soviet Representatives Attend</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] A meeting of 5,000 members of the "Korean Residents Union in Japan" controlled by the Communist Party was held, and 120 representatives were elected to visit North Korea.

Kato said: "The Japanese labor movement will continue to struggle until a People's Democratic Republic is established in Japan!" The organizers of the meeting said that they will ask the Allied Headquarters to allow 120 representatives to visit North Korea. Regarding this matter, the Allied Headquarters said that they may be allowed, but this is a one-way trip, and they will not be allowed to return to Japan after going to North Korea. This conference is undoubtedly part of a Korean communist propaganda campaign, which is being launched simultaneously among Korean residents in Japan and the people of South Korea, in order to undermine President Syngman Rhee's scheduled visit to Japan on the 19th.</p>

<h3>A Love Letter Leads to a Bloody Incident: Invited to Dinner, Suddenly Heard Gunfire, Young Woman Commits Suicide in Hotel; Police Station Summons Her Husband to Investigate the Cause</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Chen Jiasheng, a 27-year-old from Changsha, once served as a pilot in the Air Force and studied in the United States. After returning to China, he retired from the military. Two years ago, Chen married He Lunming (20 years old), a woman from Hankou, in their hometown, and they had a child. Recently, Chen came to Shanghai alone to look for work, and was introduced by his classmate Hu Yunxiang to room 22 of the Changfa Hotel in Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. On the 14th of this month, his wife, He Lunming, also followed him to Shanghai with their young child and found Chen's residence. The next afternoon, Chen, his wife, and his friend Hu Yunxiang went to the New York General Assembly on Sichuan Road to dance. When paying for tea, Chen took money from He's wallet and unexpectedly found a love letter from someone named He. He quickly snatched back the wallet and tore up the love letter, throwing it on the ground. Chen picked up the torn letter from the floor and took it back to the hotel, where he questioned his wife. This led to a quarrel. Yesterday afternoon, around 2 p.m., their friend Hu Yunxiang persuaded Chen and his wife to go out for a walk, hoping to restore their marital relationship. However, He remained depressed and unhappy. Around 8 p.m., Chen invited He out for dinner, but she refused. So Chen and Hu went out of the room first. After walking a few steps, Chen asked Hu to go back to the room and invite He to dinner again. When Hu reached the door, he suddenly heard a loud gunshot from inside the room. Hu knew something had happened and quickly broke open the door, finding He lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing, with a bullet in her right neck. Afterwards, the hotel bookkeeper reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau. The head of the judicial section, Xu Shibin, led patrol officer Jiang Tianfu, police officer Xu Daren, and Liu Shizhu to investigate. They found a revolver, several bullets, and many small photos of He in the suitcase. He was rushed to the Country Hospital for treatment, and as of this morning, she was still undergoing surgery. Her life is said to be in danger. Chen and Hu were both taken to the police station for questioning. According to Chen, the gun was one he had carried when he served in the Air Force, and he brought it to Shanghai in his suitcase from his hometown. The investigation is underway to determine whether He's suicide was voluntary or instigated.</p>

<h3>Wu Yun Chu Hosts Visit to Three Factories: Main Raw Materials Are Water and Air, Electricity Restrictions Hinder Development</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Industrialist Wu Yun Chu yesterday hosted members of the press to visit his Tianli Liquefied Gas Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, and Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory. After browsing the equipment of each factory and witnessing the continuous production process, the reporters deeply felt that in this autumn of economic bankruptcy and industrial depression, it is truly commendable that these three factories can increase production and strive for development under difficult circumstances. Wu is famous in the world for inventing monosodium glutamate (MSG), but the focus of his industrial efforts lies in the Tianli and Tianyuan factories. The former produces oxygen, nitric acid, and ammonia, while the latter produces hydrochloric acid, bleaching powder, and caustic soda, all of which are important chemical industrial products. Both factories are located near Beixinjing. During the War of Resistance, some of the machinery was moved west, and most of the equipment was destroyed. Post-war restoration was full of difficulties. The Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory resumed operations this spring, while the Tianli Liquefied Gas Factory took three years to restore production. The Liquefied Gas Factory uses new high-pressure machinery, using nitrogen and water from the air as raw materials to first produce ammonia, and then nitric acid with a concentration of 98%, making it the only concentrated nitric acid manufacturer in the country. Currently, the daily output of ammonia is more than one ton, which can produce more than four tons of nitric acid. The daily output of oxygen is more than 200 cylinders (each cylinder holds 6 cubic meters). However, this output is still less than half of what it was before the war, due to electricity restrictions. If all the machinery were running at full capacity, it would require more than 2,000 kilowatts of electricity per month, but the power company can only supply 800 kilowatts, greatly affecting production. The Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory uses the electrolysis of salt method and can produce 450 tons of caustic soda, 3,700 boxes of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 4,000 boxes of bleaching powder per month. Recently, a new rotary bleaching powder tower is under construction. The Tianchu MSG Factory uses wheat gluten and other materials as raw materials and can produce more than 400 tons of MSG per month. Wu believes that the raw materials for basic chemical industries are mainly taken from the natural world in the form of air and water, so there is no problem, but the lack of electricity is very difficult. If the coal energy source for electric power can be continuously supplied, then with the cooperation of coal, air, and water, the chemical industry can be greatly developed.</p>
<h3>Citywide Household Registration to be Checked at the End of the Month: National Identity Cards to be Reissued; Municipal Government Issues Special Notice to Subordinates and All Citizens: Those Who Have Not Registered Must Report Before the 25th</h3>

<h3>Case of Fraudulently Obtaining Jewelry Store Ornaments: Two Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment, Economic Brigade Squad Leader Wang Shuci Acquitted</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Wu Bofan, who worked as a broker, and Zhou Yunshan, who was unemployed, heard in early February of this year that Qiu Zhaoyan's Baokang Jewelry Store at 703 Xin Zha Road was suspected of dealing in gold and foreign currency. They and other defendants in other cases, Zhou Kuangshan, Shao Xingnan, Xiang Xiuying, Zhou Jingwei, etc., went to the Juele Hotel to discuss the matter. Through Zhang Lin, an economic police officer from the Municipal Police Bureau, they tipped off the Economic Section to obtain a reward. The head of the Economic Brigade, Cheng Yi Kuan, assigned squad leader Wang Shuci on the morning of the 24th of the same month to lead police officers Zhang Lin and others, as well as informants Wu Bofan and Zhou Yunshan, to search the Baokang Jewelry Store. Shao Xingnan and Zhou Kuangshan followed the police officers separately to Qiu Zhaoyan's house on Datong Road to search. Wu and Zhou were assigned to guard the telephone. They finally found more than 40 taels of gold bars and 270 million yuan in legal currency in the jewelry store, as well as a wooden box containing more than 100 taels of ornaments. Wang Shuci sealed the wooden box, intending to take it to the bureau along with the gold bars. However, the jewelry store's bookkeeper, Zhu Wenbin, claimed that exchanging ornaments was not illegal and presented a permit from the Social Affairs Bureau and a receipt for the application as proof. Wang, believing his request to be reasonable, returned the original wooden box. Zhang Lin, who was on the run, saw an opportunity and defrauded the store employee Shen Guigen of 30 taels of ornaments. The loot was distributed the next day under the direction of Zhang Lin. After the police station learned of this, they arrested Wu and others and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The District Court sentenced Wu Bofan and Zhou Yunshan to three years and six months of imprisonment each for taking advantage of their positions to defraud others of property. Wang Shuci was acquitted. Zhang Lin is still wanted.</p>

<h3>General Prices Seek a Way Out in Turmoil</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new economic plan, the Shanghai market has been truly turbulent and has undergone many changes; however, in terms of market depression and sparse transactions, the past week was the most notable. In the past week, many items, including yarn, cloth, flour, oil, and cakes, were ordered or publicly suspended from the market. There are countless others that are in a state of semi-suspension or are not officially suspended but are actually suspended. On the other hand, regarding the measures on price limits, on the one hand, the authorities reiterated their determination to strengthen maintenance, and on the other hand, there was talk of adjusting them when necessary. Looking at the market from the perspective of floating capital, the money market was extremely loose and flooded in the early and middle of last week, with estimates of about 1 billion yuan in congestion, and the underground interest rate was once as low as 1%. Northern capital flowed south, and the authorities in charge of Guangdong and Guangxi restricted the entry of cash, not exceeding 1,000 yuan. The control in Southwest China was looser, and the underground interest rate in the Chongqing and Chengdu areas was as high as 12 to 14 yuan, thus forming a phenomenon of capital flowing westward. In short, the current economy has reached a turbulent situation. Maintaining price limits has various difficulties, and abandoning price limits has an even more uncertain future. There are many discussions, and there are also many who are advocating their own positions with a certain bias. It is hoped that the wise authorities will be able to make up their minds, identify their goals, and not disrupt their own steps.</p>
<p>The most important measure taken by the authorities in charge last week was the solution to the raw material supply problem. The Shanghai Materials Adjustment Committee meeting passed the following measures for the supply of industrial raw materials: (1) Industrial raw materials should be divided into the following three types according to the source of supply: (A) all from domestic sources, (B) all from foreign sources, and (C) part from domestic sources, but the insufficient part still needs to be obtained from foreign sources, so as to facilitate planning supply and distribution. (2) Raw materials obtained domestically: (A) those with special management agencies shall be coordinated by the special management agencies. (B) those without special management agencies shall be responsible for supply by the trade associations. (C) those without special management agencies and trade associations shall be consulted by the Central Trust Bureau for procurement. (3) Raw materials obtained from foreign countries should be based on the principle of minimizing the increase in government foreign exchange expenditures, and the Import and Export Control Commission should complete the allocation procedures for the fifth and sixth quarters as soon as possible to facilitate import. (4) Regarding the distribution issue, except for cotton, fuel, and imported raw materials, which are all managed by special agencies, for the remaining raw materials that do not have distribution agencies, the labor unions are planning to collect data, formulate distribution measures, and submit them to the Materials Adjustment Committee for transfer to the Economic Control Supervisor for approval and implementation. (5) Although each distribution agency has its own affiliation, for the sake of overall coordination and adjustment, it is necessary to report the production and sales figures of various materials to the Adjustment Committee on a regular basis so that it can understand the overall situation. The form for this regular reporting is to be negotiated and handled by the Secretariat of the Committee with the various agencies. (6) The amount of raw materials currently in stock for each manufacturer should be clarified, and the Social Affairs Bureau should handle the registration.</p>
<p>On the third day after the above measures were passed (the 15th), a spokesman for the Bureau of Economic Control stated: "(1) In order to ensure a sufficient supply of industrial raw materials, this Bureau has decided that in addition to the foreign exchange quota currently stipulated by the national banks, US$20 million will now be paid by the national banks to the Central Trust Bureau to entrust it to order various industrial raw materials from foreign countries. (2) It has recently been found that some importers in this city are hoarding raw materials. Yesterday, the responsible persons of the industry and commerce trade associations were summoned by the Supervisor's Office and ordered to submit a detailed list of the import orders for the past three months to the Supervisor for reference within three days, and ordered that all raw materials be distributed and sold to the factories at the August 19 price limit."</p>
<p>Regarding the supply of rice in this city, the arrival of goods was scarce last week, and high-quality goods disappeared, with only some transactions of medium-quality goods. Supervisor Jiang then summoned Wan Molin, Zhu Yongming, and other important figures in the rice industry for talks and decided (1) the Bureau of Economic Control can solve the difficulties encountered in purchasing rice at any time, (2) the purchasing certificates required by the purchasing merchants will be stamped and issued by the Supervisor's Office, and (3) the sugar in this city will be exchanged for rice in other ports.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the comprehensive rationing system for daily necessities, the authorities are quite determined. It has been decided that starting next month, rice, oil, salt, cloth, and coal will be rationed first, and then extended to other items. A general census of the city's population will be conducted soon, and new identity cards will be reissued with attached purchase certificates in preparation for the implementation of the rationing system.</p>
<p>Regarding market control, Supervisor Jiang convened representatives of wholesale merchants from 17 units, including cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rice, cotton, woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, cigarettes, Western medicines, rubber, paper, miscellaneous grains, edible oil, food, vegetables, woolen yarn, department stores, and silk fabrics, to listen to their difficulties in business. Jiang stated that price limits must be observed and that black markets will not be tolerated. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau will hold the second phase of inventory registration for daily necessities, stipulating that the items to be registered are sugar, soap, woolen yarn, kerosene, charcoal, firewood, and soybeans.</p>
<p>According to the National Bank of China, in order to guide idle funds and promote production, the government will allow the issuance of corporate bonds, through banking organizations, to be used for production purposes without increasing currency issuance. The pilot program for this corporate bond is planned to start with the factories and mines under the Resources Committee, which will be purchased by the national banks and then resold to the people. President Yu of the National Bank of China also invited Li Ming, Wang Zhishen, and other responsible persons of banks in this city on Thursday to discuss the organization of a banking group to underwrite corporate bonds and handle production loans in the future. The measures for the issuance of state-owned corporate bonds are said to have been jointly drafted by the Resources Committee and the Central Bank and will be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for approval and will be announced and issued in the near future.</p>
<p>Currency and Finance</p>
<h3>The Money Market Outside the Industry Remains Loose, While the Positions Within the Industry Become Increasingly Tight</h3>
<p>Last week, the money market in this city, in terms of outside the industry, remained loose due to sluggish transactions and sparse demand, but in general, it was no longer as abnormally flooded as in the previous week due to the absorption by certain groups. In terms of within the industry, the loose trend suddenly decreased from Wednesday, and the supply of money from banks and financial institutions was no longer as widespread as in the past. Interbank lending became more active, but because the supply was abundant, turnover was convenient. According to the idle funds in this city, the accumulated amount had reached more than 700 to 800 million yuan by the end of the previous week. This slight stabilization of the money market is also the first time since "August 19." The reasons for this are nothing more than the following points: First, most ports outside Shanghai generally show a tight money market and high underground interest rates, especially in Chengdu and Chongqing, which is a kind of attraction for the idle funds in this city. The reason why funds have flowed out sharply in the past week is probably due to this reason. It is estimated that the daily outflow of funds is between 1.2 million and 5 million yuan, which has also helped a lot in stabilizing the money market. Second, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications opened current deposit accounts with a monthly interest rate of 2% for commercial banks and financial institutions, adding another outlet for those with surplus funds. It is said that the amount of this current deposit has reached 20 million yuan in recent days. Third, the underground interest rate in Tianjin and other places is as high as 30%, and the authorities have stipulated that the withdrawal of funds remitted from the north will be made in installments, so the outflow of funds to the south has decreased compared with the past. Fourth, short-term treasury bills continue to be sold, and by the end of last week, the total amount had reached more than 100 million gold yuan. The funds invested in real estate have also exceeded 100 million yuan since "August 19," which has also had a small effect on tightening the money market. Fifth, the measures for increasing the capital of banks and financial institutions have been officially announced, increasing the industry's demand for funds.</p>
<p>As for cash, it was also shorter than before last week, which is because part of the outflow of funds was carried out by transporting cash. It is reported that some people have been collecting 50 and 100 yuan gold yuan notes in recent days, which may be related to the transportation of cash.</p>
<p>Although the authorities have prohibited the public from announcing the detailed figures of the clearing differences of the national banks, it is known that the huge clearing difference on Tuesday last week set a new record after the currency reform. On Wednesday and Friday, due to the collection of payments and deposits from other banks, the national banks reversed the precedent since September 9 and turned from deficit to surplus, but the amount of the surplus was not large. As for foreign banks, they all showed a surplus from Monday to Friday. Commercial banks and financial institutions all showed a deficit on Wednesday and Thursday, and the deficit on Wednesday was as high as more than 6 million yuan, which is of course also one of the phenomena of the money market becoming tight.</p>
<p>Speaking of the market underground interest rate, it also rose consistently in the situation of the money market within the industry becoming tight. For example, on Tuesday, it was only between 2% and 4%, but after Wednesday, it generally rose to 6.5%, and on Friday, it even rose to 9%. It is also said that the longer-term interest rate is as high as 20% or more, which is said to be specially for transferring these funds to Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places to make national profits.</p>
<p>Last week, the internal remittance rate of commercial banks and financial institutions in this city did not change in the situation of funds being remitted out exceeding the inflow. The Guangzhou remittance rate was still 24 yuan, but the Central Bank has limited the Guangzhou remittance to only 5,000 yuan per transaction to prevent the large outflow of funds to the south. The Xiamen remittance rate was 20 yuan, and the remittance rates for Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, and other places were all 12 yuan. The Tianjin remittance rate was 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Last week, the official foreign exchange rate remained the same. Gold shops have stopped buying and selling gold jewelry. The price of gold in Hong Kong hovered downward. On Monday, the price of gold per tael was HK$318. On Tuesday, it fell by HK$2. On Wednesday, it fell to HK$314.5. On Thursday, it shrank to HK$309.75. The market price of the US dollar in Hong Kong once rebounded from the previous week. It is said that one of the reasons was that a certain bank bought a large amount of US dollars in Hong Kong, and the other reason was that the outflow of funds from this city promoted competition. Last week, the market price of the US dollar in Hong Kong was stable at a high of 5.31 yuan from Monday to Wednesday, but the price suddenly softened on Thursday, only making 5.28 yuan.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Trends</p>
<h3>How to Solve the Problem of Raw Material Supply?</h3>
<p>In the recent surge of panic buying, how to expand the supply of raw materials has become one of the most important issues urgently needed to be resolved by the industrial and commercial sectors. According to Huadong News Agency, an industrial tycoon made two suggestive remarks on the issue of easing raw material supply: (1) Various raw materials that cannot be produced domestically should be imported as much as possible. The import quota can be increased according to needs. The foreign exchange paid should mainly come from export settlement and overseas remittances, and the current foreign exchange obtained by the Central Bank and various collecting banks should be allocated to supplement it. (2) The selling prices of various raw materials that can be produced domestically in the production areas must be strictly stabilized. There are also many wealthy households in rural areas who hoard and speculate, and they should also be thoroughly inspected and ordered to sell. In addition, the quantity of raw materials needed by each factory should be planned, reviewed and allocated in a unified manner. The above two points can represent some of the industrial and commercial sectors' views on the issue of easing raw material problems.</p>
<p>However, whether the opinions of the people can be approved is still quite questionable. For example, the Shanghai District Materials Regulation Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 12th to discuss the supply of industrial raw materials and the regulation of daily necessities in detail. However, the resolution on importing foreign raw materials still decided to adhere to the principle of minimizing the government's foreign exchange expenditure. The import quota also only decided that the Import and Export Management Committee should expedite the completion of the allocation procedures for the fifth and sixth quarters, without showing any signs of relaxation.</p>
<p>Since the import quota stipulated by the government cannot be relaxed under the principle of not increasing foreign exchange expenditure, the focus of the problem will inevitably shift to self-provided foreign exchange. According to those who can use self-provided foreign exchange to import materials and raw materials, there are generally three sources. The first is the foreign exchange positions held by Chinese people, but most of them have now been collected by the government. The first is the import of overseas capital in the form of materials. Although the provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 16th has passed the measures for overseas capital to apply for import, most of the measures are aimed at the importers of production equipment. Regarding the import of raw materials, Article 4 of the measures stipulates that it is limited to the applicant's own use and does not exceed six months of production needs. Under this regulation, ordinary industrialists and businessmen who do not also have the status of "overseas Chinese" are naturally excluded. Even for industrialists and businessmen who also have the status of "overseas Chinese," it is questionable whether they are willing to risk importing raw materials with a six-month limit under the current situation. According to reports: "The Import and Export Management Committee has received very few applications for overseas capital import in recent days." This is probably not accidental. Finally, the third source of self-provided foreign exchange is of course the exchange settlement of exporters. In other words, only by striving to increase export exchange settlement can the expansion of raw material re-import be demanded. However, this hope is also felt to be slim due to "the recent inconsistent domestic market conditions for export goods, making it difficult for merchants to purchase and transport them, which poses a problem for promoting imports and striving for domestic exchange." Furthermore, although the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 16th passed the measures for applying for the import of foreign orders for which payment has been made, the clearance of this import is not only limited to goods ordered and paid for before "August and September," but must also be limited to those allowed to be remitted in accordance with the "Central Bank's Foreign Currency Deposit Payment Measures." It can be seen that it is difficult to have a significant effect on expanding raw material imports to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>Since the large-scale import of foreign raw materials has become a problem, the expansion of domestic raw material supply is mixed with optimism due to the inability to thoroughly implement the price restriction policy. This is a simple truth. On the one hand, it is necessary to adhere to the "August 19th" defense line, and on the other hand, it is constantly creating floating capital and purchasing a large amount of materials from production areas. As a result, urban and rural prices are reversed, and the source of raw materials is cut off without being cut off. It can be seen that the reason why the supply of raw materials has shrunk in recent days is not simply a raw material problem, but a link in the entire economic policy and the entire political problem.</p>
<h3>Allocation Ratio of College Funding - Ministry of Education Explains Standards for the Second Half of the Year - Increased Research Equipment Costs Must Be Viewed in Light of National Financial Resources</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] The allocation ratio of funding for national universities: during the war, those used for salaries and meals for faculty and students accounted for slightly less than 50%, while those used for research equipment accounted for slightly more than 50%. Currently, faculty and student expenses account for 80%, and only 20% is used for research equipment. General equipment is considered simple. The Ministry of Education recently convened a symposium of university presidents, requesting improvement, with 60% used for salaries and meals, and 40% used for research. (Already recorded in this newspaper) This proposal is equivalent to increasing the current funding for each university by about 40%. The progress of this matter is being watched by all parties.</p>
<p>According to statements from responsible parties in the Ministry of Education: The funding for national colleges and universities can be listed in five categories. The allocation standards for the second half of the year are briefly described below: (1) Regular expenses are first calculated by converting the nature of each college's departments and subjects into points, and then listed according to the points each college should receive and the number of students. (2) Construction equipment expansion and improvement fees are listed according to the points each college should receive and the actual needs. (3) Temporary special project expenses are listed based on the special needs of each college in the second half of this year. (4) Employee living expenses have been paid in gold yuan since August of this year. Living expenses are allocated by the national treasury in accordance with the approved payment standards for the number of budgeted employees. (5) Meals for publicly funded students and scholarship students are issued in accordance with the number of students in each college and the approved standards in each region. Categories (1), (2), and (3) are used for research equipment, while categories (4) and (5) are used for salaries and meals for faculty and students. However, the situation varies depending on the number of employees and students in each college, the quality of existing equipment, and the location. Therefore, even in terms of the funding for the second half of this year, the allocation ratio of expenses for faculty and student salaries and meals to research equipment expenses is not entirely the same, and it is even more disparate compared to the pre-war ratio of 50% each. The Ministry of Education is planning to invite experts to conduct detailed research on this proposal. If the research equipment expenses are changed to 40%, it will inevitably increase the total annual expenditure of the country because the Ministry of Education has no other sources of funding. Therefore, this improvement must be gradually improved depending on the country's financial resources and the amount of total tax revenue. If it can be realized in the short term, the Ministry of Education will go all out.</p>

<h3>Football League Opens - 3-0 One-Sided Victory - Qingbai Defeats Qunli Completely</h3>
<p>The fourth football league opened yesterday. Qingbai defeated Qunli completely with a dominant posture of 3-0. The first half was 1-0. The situation was completely one-sided. The audience in the Yiyuan stands was estimated at about 3,000 people, which was quite lively.</p>
<p>Qingbai attacked first. At seven minutes, Xiao Fei crossed the ball, and Afu headed it, but it was caught by Xie Boming. After that, it was all Qingbai's offense, and Qunli's hinterland was often ravaged. At 20 minutes, Lin Shaojun started an uprising on the wing, and Jiang Yanqing committed a foul by tripping someone. Sun Hanxing took a penalty kick, but it was saved by Huang Shijie, which won applause from the audience. Yan Shixin replaced Fu Naidang. At 40 minutes, Lusheng dribbled the ball and went deep along the side. Xiao Luo passed the ball to Afu, who did not hesitate and kicked it into the goal. Boming撲扑住, but the ball had already entered the white line. Qingbai took the lead 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, Qingbai did not make any changes. Qunli replaced Jin Jiasheng and Yu Musen with Yu Zhenyue and Chen Laifa. Five minutes into the game, Xiao Gu dribbled the ball deep and passed it to Xiao Fei, who shot it into the goal near the goal, adding another goal to make it 2-0. Half an hour later, Xiao Fei passed the ball to Xiao Gu, and Afu kicked it straight into the goal, making it 3-0. Qingbai won three goals cleanly. In order to reverse the decline, Qunli interchanged Yu Zhenyue and Lin Shaojun, but it still did not improve. Xiao Gu陷一城 again, but it was not ordered because of offside. Before the time ran out, Qunli's Yao Lihua attacked the camp alone, and Huang Shijie撲撲空, but fortunately Meng Yiliang was behind to kick it away. The silver whistle blew, and Qingbai defeated Qunli with three goals.</p>

<h3>Remembering Dafu</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Dafu's birth year cannot be verified, and his death date cannot be examined. This coincides with Zhu Muqing's saying that writers are unwilling to fill out resumes. However, heaven and earth are the inn of all things, and time is a passing traveler of a hundred generations. In a short life, as long as it is enough to comfort oneself and others, that is enough. As for ordinary people who are afraid of not recording their birth and death dates completely, and regard it as the only important way in social interaction, this is ultimately the behavior of petty men, not enough to talk to elegant people and reclusive scholars. And Dafu's personality is indeed not someone who is rigidly benevolent or overly righteous. He thought of everything as acting on stage and never thoroughly investigated it. Even his own age was not allowed to be clarified by his descendants. As for the number of books, he even said that there were as many as five million volumes. If so, I think the booksellers in Hangzhou would definitely know about it. But I have never heard them talk about Dafu's collection of books.</p>
<p>That's right, Dafu did have a book-buying habit. When we lived in the same hotel in Tokyo, he often brought back a few books from the old bookstores in Jinbocho, saying that he had bought many good books today. The quality of the books certainly varies depending on the person, time, and place. So I often told him that these were all your good books. As for whether he read them after buying so many books, that is another question.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Dafu was on the day I took the entrance exam for the preparatory course of Tokyo First High School in the second year of the Republic. His seat was right in front of me, and Xu Zuzheng was behind me. In the end, 32 people were selected from the 800 to 900 candidates. Both Dafu and I passed the arts course. Later, we lived together. He told me that he was engaged, which was decided by his brother Yu Hua. And he was about two or three years younger than me at the time, or one or two years younger. If someone asks me how old I am this year, as proof of Dafu's age, I would say that if I have a hundred years of longevity, then I have passed more than half of it. If we were to cite the saying that seventy is rare since ancient times, then Dafu did not die young, and I am already on the front line today.</p>
<p>Dafu and I often acted in unison. We believed that the arts course was empty, and it would be more reliable to transfer to the medical course. After the transfer exam, we both became medical students. After graduating from high school preparatory, he entered the Fifth High School, and I entered the Fourth High School; he entered Kyoto University, and I entered Kyushu University; there were very few opportunities to see each other. And he, who was good at changing, changed from medical science to economics.</p>
<p>After he and I left Japan, we didn't meet many times. Once, in a hotel in Shanghai, I saw him and Moruo lying on the bed, saying that you came at the right time, you can see our life today. This was exactly the era when they were busy writing, the era when writers were down on their luck, and also the era of their "creation." After that, I accidentally saw him once in a Shanghai tram. He said that he had not been feeling well recently and was afraid that he had lung disease. From his haggard face, I had already seen that he was suffering from a chronic illness, and the heroic spirit of his youth had long been shrouded in twilight. But from his changeable temperament, there were still a few traces of his early demeanor left. He told me that his home was in Peiping and that he wanted to see his wife. At the same time, I didn't ask him whether a person with a double life was enough to kill his body and mind.</p>
<p>What I can't forget most about Dafu is the time we spent in the dormitory. After we had evening self-study, we often wanted to sneak out of school to eat something. But the gate was heavily guarded, and we couldn't cross the line. So we ventured to escape from the side gate, and after a full meal, we brought a few raw eggs in our pockets and climbed back in from the side gate. When we returned to the dormitory, just as we were about to摸摸出 the eggs, alas,天地玄黃 had long become 宇宙洪荒. When both hands were stained with egg yolk, we never dared to show any expression in front of our classmates, and only looked at each other like prisoners of Chu.</p>
<p>Recalling the situation at that time, it seemed that Dafu was still shining in front of me. But this was already more than thirty years ago. Alas, Dafu!</p>
<h3>Qing Ping Yue</h3>
<p>— Gu Fei</p>
<p>Waking up as if drunk, gauze green hides my sorrows. My soul drifts further from my pillow, dreams only adding to my misery. The small lamp casts a dim red glow. The small window turns lightly, revealing silver buds. I move the bright mirror from the window, the person in the mirror resembling a yellow flower.</p>
<h3>Ode to Mother-Forget-Me-Not Flowers</h3>
<p>Fragrant snowflakes feel a thousand points cold, light floats in a clear stream beneath the bright moon, always blooming and falling without restraint, why should foolish people painfully entrust their feelings.</p>
<h3>New Initiatives in the US Postal Service</h3>
<p>— Cong Zhi</p>
<p>The US Postal Service recently proposed issuing a "Special Express Stamp" with a face value of 20 cents. Its main function is to replace the currently popular "Air Express" stamp of 18 cents. Anyone who uses "Special Express Stamps" does not need to specify what method to use for delivery. Instead, postal experts will plan the fastest route, ensuring that the letter arrives faster than a regular air express letter that has to wait for a plane.</p>
<h3>Drinking Alone</h3>
<p>— Yu Chuang</p>
<p>There are only a few chrysanthemums in the vase, and they seem to be gradually withering, but they are still vermilion and dark green, reflecting each other's beauty. A golden thread on the edge of the petals is even more like a finely crafted golden dragon painted on the outside of those vermilion lacquer teacups. That red, that green, plus those lithe golden yellows, form a strong picture rich in oriental colors.</p>
<p>Under the flowers are two or three dishes and a pot of warm good wine. On the left side of the table is a book that I like to read. I drink my cup slowly. Sometimes, in order to repeatedly ponder a poem, I forget to drink the wine; sometimes, in order to savor the taste of the wine, or to revel in the countless associations that the chrysanthemums give me, I forget the book. The poem is full of beautiful scenery: a sky full of brilliant clouds, small wildflowers swaying in the wind all over the mountains, a young man gently knocking on the door in the dark night, seeing in the flash of a match that the one who opens the door is the girl he loves so much... The chrysanthemums also bring me countless dreams: those forgotten smiles and frowns, just like a wisp of smoke slowly rising into the clear sky, I thought they had disappeared completely, but in the blink of an eye, they reappear vaguely.</p>
<p>It is silent. Under the lamp, the small room seems smaller and warmer than during the day. I silently raise my glass, and I feel that this moment is completely my own. I don't have to be as careful as I am in public, enduring all kinds of restraints; I don't have to force myself to accompany those annoying guests who keep shouting "Cheers"; everything is natural, drink when you want to drink, stay when you want to stay. Wearing a comfortable old jacket and dragging a pair of cloth shoes, I put all the idleness behind me, my heart and face are empty, and I can read the good books that I have always liked to read but never had time to read. Moreover, reading at this time is exactly what Bacon called "chewing" and "digesting," with wonderful meanings emerging one after another and endless images. Compared with the reading method more than ten years ago in university, with the table full of reference books and notebooks, the difficulty is different, and the meaning is not quite the same. Perhaps, the hard study behind closed doors more than ten years ago was for today's preparation?</p>
<p>Sometimes, I push the book aside for a while, gladly raise my glass, and think like this: All day long, I have worked hard and diligently, without doing anything fraudulent or selfish, without letting anyone down. I still have these few enchanting chrysanthemums in front of me, and the cup is full of fragrant and rich good wine, isn't that gratifying? To be able to have a moment of tranquility in my heart is the ultimate blessing.</p>
<p>In the quiet night, I only hear the chirping of crickets around the eaves outside the window. Autumn is already deep, and another year is about to pass. If you say it's bleak, it's true that it's a bit bleak. Year after year passes, and when I look at everything, I always feel that the meaning is gradually fading. Life is like this, without brilliant sparks, without dazzling light, just like a plain and ordinary stream in a Jiangnan village, flowing quietly. This stream could not generate unparalleled electricity like a torrent, so that the people on both banks could universally receive its benefits; but, if there were clusters of beautiful little flowers on both sides of this stream, nourished by the stream, growing up, then there is nothing to regret, is there?</p>
<p>I push open the window and see the cold moon in the sky. As the wind passes, the leaves in the garden rustle. The chrysanthemums in the vase quietly fell down. I quietly raised my wine glass again.</p>
<h3>Human Skin Book</h3>
<p>— Song Xian</p>
<p>Before the French Revolution, Rousseau wrote "The Social Contract." It was greatly ridiculed by many nobles at the time, who said that the book's arguments were empty and not worth mentioning. But these nobles were mostly sent to the guillotine during the revolutionary frenzy, executed, and unexpectedly, the skin of their remains was used as the cover of "The Social Contract."</p>
<p>The British Museum Library has a book bound in the skin of a murderer. The Marlborough Library in London also has two books said to be bound in the skin of two witches.</p>
<p>Even more strange is that a French woman, admiring the works of the astronomer Camille Flammarion, made a will, wishing to dedicate the skin of her remains after death to binding these books.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>A new aluminum bridge has been built in Quebec, Canada, weighing only 400,000 pounds. If steel were used to build a bridge of the same length, it would weigh about 1.5 million pounds.</p>
<p>A kind of "glass" ball (the "glass" of "glass stockings," i.e., "plastic") has recently become popular in the United States. It is filled with clear water, and fresh flowers are placed inside, which magnifies the shape of the flowers when viewed from the outside, and the colors are particularly bright. The ball is about seven inches in diameter, with a spiral on the upper part that can be opened and closed.</p>
<h3>Xue Nei Ling</h3>
<p>In the twenty days after the currency reform, there were several types of shops in Beiping that were "selling off" rather than "snapping up." These were silk shops, eyewear and watch shops, and department stores. These luxury goods shops were mostly located in busy downtown areas, resplendent and magnificent. The owners and staff were all dressed in extraordinary clothes, with high expenses and heavy taxes. Moreover, they were all close to each other, with similar appearances. Beiping was not a prosperous commercial port. Although there were some modern men and women, the supply greatly exceeded the demand. Although department stores were timely tools for profit (because they also sold shiny and fragrant everyday goods), one store profited, and many more continued to open. The two main streets in the east and west cities were dazzling. Many department stores and companies often posted slogans such as "Grand Lottery," "Special Discount," and even "Ruthless!," "Cheap!," "Please Compare Who Is Really Cheap!" on their windows, in order to quickly sell for cash to cover expenses. After the currency reform, taking advantage of the abundant floating capital and the large number of buyers, they opened their doors even wider, clearly marking prices. Several eyewear and silk shops even jointly published large advertisements in various newspapers with the good title of "Working Together to Assist Currency Reform, Truly Selling at Limited Prices" to attract customers. Young men and women, as well as those who exchanged gold and silver for large amounts of new currency and had nowhere to settle it, flocked to them. The owners behind the counters were delighted to "clear their stock," while the customers were happy to "use their floating capital." Both sides needed each other and got what they wanted. They busily served customers, forming an unprecedented false prosperity. This lasted from the end of August to the end of September. In the past half-month, it has gradually faded. It is truly "in winter, the smoke makes the flowers like brocade, but in the blink of an eye, they will become haggard." It was originally not a normal phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Scenes of Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>I finally waited for a Sunday, which was also the annual National Day. How could I waste it in vain? I had long ago arranged for a friend who had just come to Nanjing to go shopping in the morning and visit Yanzi Rock in the afternoon. That day was indeed what is called a clear blue sky, without a cloud in sight. We went straight from Gulou to Xinjiekou. We saw crowds of people everywhere, and national flags flying everywhere. Nanjing had many government offices, and each one was decorated with some color. The shops were also particularly pleasing this year, celebrating by closing their doors, as if it were the New Year. We ran straight to the Central Market (the largest market in Nanjing), but the iron gates were tightly closed. A large group of civil servants, soldiers, and ordinary citizens were sighing in front of the door, as if they had to spend some money. We ran through half of Nanjing, still empty-handed, and the loudspeakers in Xinjiekou had already chimed twelve o'clock. We had to fill our stomachs first.</p>
<p>Nanjing's snacks are famous, with flavors from Tianjin, Beiping, Suzhou, Sichuan, Hunan, and more. But the recent booming business often makes the bosses nervous. As soon as we walked into that small restaurant, the boss quickly bowed to us: "Please come earlier next time!" We didn't fall for his trick and barged in, waiting in the corner. Seeing that a table was about to finish eating, we took the opportunity to occupy the seats. We almost "snatched" our order and sat for three-quarters of an hour before we could finally enjoy our meal. A small civil servant-like person sitting across from me ordered a large basin of steamed buns, a large portion of home-style rice, two stir-fried dishes, and a bowl of sliced ear soup, which surprised me greatly. He seemed to realize it too, and said blankly: "Isn't it good to eat more when there's something to eat?" He pointed to the countless people who were burying their heads in eating and said: "I'm not alone!"</p>
<p>After filling ourselves, we walked out of the restaurant sadly and ran straight to Jiangnan Station. We wanted to go to Yanzi Rock to broaden our minds and wash away the sour aftertaste of that small civil servant. When we arrived at the station, the long queue had already turned a corner. We had no choice but to buy tickets and line up at the back. In the past, there was a Jiangnan train to Yanzi Rock every ten minutes. I thought at most three trains would take the people in front, so I waited with peace of mind. I didn't know that things were different now. We waited for half an hour before a train slowly arrived. Fortunately, a ticket seller told me that trains to Yanzi Rock now ran every hour and a half. I calculated that I would have to wait another four and a half hours to get on the train. If I waited another four and a half hours for the train back to the city after arriving at Yanzi Rock, it would probably be the next morning. So I had to give up and drag my tired body to the movie theater to try my luck.</p>
<p>There were only six movie theaters in Nanjing. We chose one that was showing an "art" film, thinking that fewer people might come. Unexpectedly, that theater had few seats and also allowed advance sales, so the window of the ticket office seemed to change magically, opening and closing in an instant. In just a moment, it was announced that the tickets were sold out. I looked at my friend who had just come to Nanjing, and had to express my infinite apologies. We couldn't laugh or cry, it was truly a case of mixed emotions.</p>
<p>We had no choice but to wander aimlessly on the streets filled with crowds. We saw the twilight gradually blurring, the setting sun slowly sinking, and suddenly realized that the holiday was over.</p>
