<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕政院新聞局長董顯光，廿一日在記者招待會席上，答覆詢問如下：</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕立院財金委會廿一日晨開會，財部錢幣司長王撫洲列席，報告東北金融問題，並答覆質詢。據王氏解釋：央行分行不得已，乃發出大量本票，其數字及膨脹速度，復使政府不能於改革幣制後允許金圓券在長春流通，蓋如以金圓券兌回流通券，金圓券之全部發行額，數月間卽將告罄，因是經詳慎考慮後，政府始決定改發軍糧票，至瀋陽雖亦有軍糧票，但為債券性質，不能流通，自不會發生惡果。此外，對東北各地官銀號之設立，財部已去電制止。王氏於答覆質問後，卽行離去，會議乃進行討論國庫法草案，照初步審查意見修正通過，將提報院會作最後決定。</p>

<h3>從銀根談到游資和物價</h3>
<p>本市銀根，曾經鬆濫到二三分，還是拆不出去，而近日忽又步緊，月息已高到九分至一角五分，長期拆款，竟有超過三角者，據業中人看法，最短期內，或恐尙無回鬆之象。此中原因，自有多端，而要以游資外逃為其主因。</p>
<p>關於游資充斥這一點，我們曾送指出，認為有急予疎導的必要。否則，對於一般物價，將是一重大威脅。現在本市限價，雖以管制得力，大體上尙能保持「八·一九」的水凖，然以得不到正當的出路，終於以大量外逃的方式，迫使銀根帶緊，暗息高翔，這並非出人意料之事。</p>
<p>為穩定市面起見，對於當前的籌碼問題，如何酌盈劑虛，以便利正當工商業的周轉，這自有國家銀行主持，應不難予以解決。所成為問題的，還是如許游資應如何吸收。因為瀦集在本市，或橫決到他處，這不過是地域的移轉，而於實質上並沒有絲毫解決。近來廣州及西南等處，物價飛漲，而內地鐵路綫各且以，物資紛紛隱匿，甚至城鄉不得交流，農產物不肯上市。這可見本問題嚴重的一斑！</p>
<p>中央主管部宣示，對於疎導游資，已擬有整個方案，其具體辦法，除國營事業股票的出售，敵僞及剩餘產業的變賣，金圓庫券和珠寶獎券的發行，及實行行莊增資以外，並有發行公司債，金圓公債，及國營事業股票准予保息的擬議。我們以為任何辦法，如果要它富於吸引力，使游資樂於投入，必須把握住兩個要點：（一）利潤優存；（二）脫售便利。此次游資的大量外逃，足證第一個要點確切不誤，而除珠寶獎券以外，其他各各出售或變賣的成績，似不如理想之優美，亦足見第二個要點，亦確乎值得重視。</p>
<p>市場利率，業經政府限定，應予逐步減低，各地金管當局對此亦頗注意，努力加以抑平，其於內匯及携現的數量，並經分別限制，嚴密查察，而資金外逃的情形，迄未能完全遏止。這一點亦可反映着利之所在，如水就下，有非單靠法令所能奏效者。</p>
<p>金融猶如血脈，貫串到整個經濟生活的全體，尤其富於敏威，銳於刺激，其起伏與流動情形，足使一般經濟界，都受到甚大的影響。在這新幣推行之初，鞏固幣值，和厲行限價，為政府最大的目標；而要安定幣值，安定物價，自非同時安定金融不為功。所以拆息高翔這一事，更反映到游資問題的迫切。</p>
<p>翁院長近在立法院中，切實聲明，將整理市場，其辦法為以全力取締囤積居奇，疏導物資來源，與依公平原則，合理限價。王財長並列舉五項辦法，以平抑物價，這自然是大家所熱切盼望的事。不過物價的變動，囤積的盛衰，與限價的能否確切維持，這與游資的多寡，都有密切的因果關係。這是可以拿法幣時代的囤積情形，和最近廣州的物價衝動來證明的。卽如最近各地的搶購風潮，為數雖極零星，似乎談不上囤積，但也未始不是化整為零的一法。又以紛紛搶購，需款較殷，加強了銀根的趨緊，和暗息的高昂。所以利息和游資，游資和囤積，囤積和物價，形成了連環性的關係，任何一環，如果調節失宜，發生了不正常的現象，便會牽連到其餘各部份。我們很盼望當局的疏導游資方案能夠趕快地拿出來，與平抑物價辦法相輔而行，以收互相配合之效。</p>

<h3>台物價瘋狂上漲　台北商界請恢復台幣機動調整　鎮配售日用品辦法決定</h3>
<p>台北　〔本報廿一日電〕繼搶購潮之後，台北物價臨瘋狂漲風，今日米價每台斤四二〇元，糖油無法購得，其他香煙，布疋，均平均漲百分之八十，黃金美鈔非法黑市達驚人數字，一般意見認為博覧會及工程師學會之召開，加重商人物資供應懸殊之敏感心理，亦為一因，官方意見則認為係受大陸影響，刻正考慮使戶口配給益趨廣泛，以緩和人心。台北商業界今緊急集會，電魏主席轉請中央恢復台幣機動調整辦法。</p>

<p>無錫　〔本報廿一日電〕油廠存油僅有二千擔，不敷軍需民用供應，今應城區三百餘家酒醬店要求，允配一次共百餘担。又錫地八一九前堆存小麥有九十萬担，米稻雜糧八十萬担，現共存祇三十萬担，相去甚鉅，今又抽出米稻二成，約二萬石供應平售，暫維民食。又米，麥，麵粉，糖，油，煙，紙，紗布等十五業，已籌組聯營分社，卽將採購配售</p>
<p>蘇州　〔本報廿一日電〕日來蘇垣糧食突發生恐慌，米店無貨應市，鄉區運城食米時為強者半途搶購，麵粉亦缺貨，雖有民食供應處十八組，然因量少米劣，且購者擁擠，不能普遍，主管當局茲已決定實施全面配給，先從米，麵，油，布等主要日用品着手。</p>

<h3>胡適函全體立委　建議制定市自治法程序</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕平津市民治促進會理事長胡適，為市自治法制定問題，今特致函立院全體立委，原函云：北平·天津市民治促進會，在本月三日的年會上，全體通過了一件議案「請立法院從速制定市或直轄市自治通則」，因為我們覺得市（尤其是直轄市）是我國現代文化的中心，是人口最稠密，工商業極發達，人民知識水凖較高的地區，所以民主政治先由市做起，似乎比較容易，憲法第廿八條規定「直轄市之自治以法律定之」，並指明直轄市得依據自治通則自制自治法。直轄市的地位，應該可以比省的地位。憲法第六十四條和第九十一條亦把省與直轄市相提並論，有些省會人口比直轄市少，文化也比直轄市低，所以我們主張直轄市的自治權，至少應該與省的自治權平等，因此，本會站在促進市民治的立場，關於市自治法的制定，向貴院建議採以下的程序；立法院依據憲法第廿八條及一百廿八條制定市或直轄市自治通則，市或直轄市得召集市民代表大會，依據市政或直轄市自治通則制定市自治法，市或直轄市自治法制定後，卽呈送司法院，司法院如認為無違處憲，該自治法卽為有效。以上是我們的一點意見，很恭敬的奉獻給貴院同人。</p>
<h3>胡氏在浙大演講　自由主義與中國</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州廿一日電〕北大校長胡適於十八日抵杭，廿日應浙大校長竺可楨之邀，假浙大健身房講演，講題為：「自由上義與中國」。胡氏首先解釋自由主義為當今世界一種最偉大的運動，繼則詳述中國古代儒者之自由主義思想，自孔孟以下如王充，王安石，朱舜水，黃黎洲等先賢，其遺著中無不富有自由主義思想，故今之所謂「自由主義」者，實為中國之「土產而非舶來品」，惟僅有「自由主義思想」或「自由主義哲學」，而無政治環境上之自由，則社會仍無自由可言，中國卽缺乏此種政治上之自由也。然而欲求得政治上之自由，則必須有一種容忍的精神與之相配合，然後自由主義始能有最完美的發揮，故今天中國要求自由主義之勝利，主要在爭取政治上之自由，與培養一般社會之容忍精神。</p>

<h3>三強接受中立國折衷案　柏林問題有轉機　維辛斯基電克林姆宮請示靜候答覆　安理會定今日恢復討論</h3>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿一日電〕西方三國廿一日定接受所謂中立國之調解方案，歡度在如柏林封鎖解除，西方放棄對蘇聯之控訴。而不斤斤於斥之為和平之威脅，由是柏林危機之轉機，頓時大啓光明。中立國所提之折衷方案，主張先由蘇聯解除柏林封鎖，然後由四強再度會商柏林貨幣及對德和約問題。按安理會主席阿根廷代表勃拉馬格里亞與蘇代表維辛斯基數度磋商後，始草擬該折衷辦法，已於今晨提交維氏及西方國家。維氏當即轉呈莫斯科，俾安理會明日恢復討論柏林危機前，能接獲克林姆宮的答覆。西方代表以為彼等極願蘇聯之認該方案乃一「有望之基礎」，足以解決東西危機。西方之不迫切控告蘇聯，傳聞已有多日，然須柏林之團解除，故在安理會中維辛斯基起立索閱折衷方案時，和平解決危機之希望頓時大增。折衷方案猶未定稿，據探悉有下列三項辦法：（一）無條件解除柏林封鎖；（二）四強重復商談柏林幣制，或與封鎖之解除同時舉行；（三）在封鎖解除之後幣制問題解決之前，四外長會議重行開會討論德國問題，由於勃拉馬格里亞曾與維辛斯基多番會議，故僉以為打破僵局尙屬可能。據此，西方乃不復堅持聯合國之向舉世作蘇聯為和平之威脅。某西方外交家稱，「吾人希望解除柏林之封鎖，如今封鎖解除之方法，吾人亦不願與蘇聯多斥糾覊，蓋封鎖足為和平之威脅。」由於兩方已採取新的立場，中立國之方案文句亦趨於積極而非消極。總之，目前之重心在於解除封鎖而非譴責蘇聯。</p>

<h3>政委會通過墨西哥建議　草親善諒解宣言　杜爾斯保證願謀取與蘇聯合作</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕今日聯大政治委員會開會時，墨西哥代表建議要求大國努力解除各國間之歧見，以便獲得永久和平。此一議案經該會一致通過，而造成久所未有之和諧空氣。對此議案首先表示贊同者為美代表杜爾斯（共和黨外交顧問）渠稱，美國代表對墨西哥代表之建議，極為歡迎，吾人接受法案中之基本原則。</p>
<p>吾人深悉戰爭勝利有極大貢獻之國家，應有權利作積極有建議性之貢獻，如此項權利不加使用，則其後果，一切聯合國之會員國必將加以關心，換言之，大國不獨有權利，並負有義務，如各大國不適當履行該項義務，則他國對於此事應加關注，渠又稱，首次外長會議破裂之原因，由於「三參加國家之一，希望使五國中其他兩國不符參加和約之起草。」餘音　　，當係指蘇聯圖阻中法兩國參加對德衛星國和約之討論。渠最後保證美國決努力與蘇覓取合作。英蘇兩國代表建議應設立一包括五強及墨西哥在內之小組委員會，起草一項親善諒解之宣言，於是小組委員會立即成立，授權起草親善諒解議案，以便向政治委員會提出。</p>
<h3>柏林西區籌備普選</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播柏林訊：西方及德國當局不顧蘇聯之反對，廿一日開始進行在柏林舉行選舉之計劃。官方稱，即使蘇瞜區阻止選舉，西部佔區之德人將於十二月五日投票選舉新市政府。柏林市官方及西方盟軍司令官雖憂懼選舉結果將產生兩個市政府，但仍斷然進行。柏林蘇聯司令官柯蒂哥夫通知代理市長費利頓斯堡稱，除非柏林西部恢復民主並重行團結，渠決不准許舉行選舉。柏林美司令霍萊上校指斥柯氏之言為無稽之談，謂」余已慣聽蘇聯之論調，余敢說柯蒂哥夫否決了選舉。」渠指出蘇聯不數舉行選舉，因恐德人將因此獲得以其觀感昭告世人之機會</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿日電〕美駐德佔領軍總司令克萊今日抵此。渠在簡短之訪問期中，將與國務部官員會商，並預定在紐約發表演說一次。代理國務卿羅維特稱，渠將利用克萊返國訪問之機會，獲得關於柏林空運及其他德國佔領問題之近況，克氏對記者稱，渠之返國訪問，並無「緊急之事務」，渠稱，渠希望與陸長羅雅爾及代理國務卿羅維特晤談，但稱，此種晤談不過為通常者。</p>

<p>〔合眾社漢城廿一日電〕在共產黨於韓國發動變亂聲中，韓內政部長為未雨綢繆計，已宣佈韓南全境戒嚴令。據最後訊：叛變之警察隊已越過麗水北五十哩之高集向光州進襲，一般僉信光州城中之共黨第五縱隊正在等候與叛軍會師。內政部長宣稱：效忠政府之先頭部隊，已馳往光州途中，政府軍與叛軍可能在該城發生決定之戰爭。渠拒絕說明馳往光州之援軍有多少人數，渠預料叛軍在二週內可撲滅。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日合眾電〕此間政府官員包括陸軍軍官皆認為朝鮮國內發生變亂，萬無使用美軍之理由，然亦可能視韓國政府之意向為定。故美國各司令官，除受李承晚所領導之韓國政府請求以外，應避免實際行動。</p>

<h3>本月配米延期截止　週內有十萬担運滬　楊綽庵保證供應全市三分二民食</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市食米供應，短期內可無問題。糧食購儲會主委楊綽庵昨日上午曾赴督導員室商洽，保證可供應全市民食之三分之二。至於其餘三分之一食米，屬於自由採購範圍者，亦由米商積極向外埠各地採辦，南昌米四千噸已開始啓運來滬，督導員辦公處已電浙贛路局，每日撥車兩列承運。萬墨林昨日亦曾赴央行接洽，要求經營當局准許布二萬疋外匯，以交換外埠之米糧。至於麵粉之供應，原料尙有問題。</p>
<p>本市十月份配米，自十六日開始配售後，市民購買者異常踴躍，致與在採辦途中之配售米無法啣接。吳市長特於昨午四時，在市府會客室邀集潘議長，宣司令，方主委，社會局吳局長，糧食儲購委會楊主委，及民食調配處陸處長等，舉行臨時會議，對加速運滬及食米分配等問題有所商討。</p>

<p>關於動力之維持，當局亦已盡最大之努力。煤荒雖仍嚴重，但已積極自台省及淮南運煤來滬，加以一部份外煤之接濟，故今後一個月內工業用煤可告無虞。至於配售所之煤屑，早告解決。</p>

<p>浙公路聯運事業　在試騐中跨進新階段  本報特派員儲裕生　　〔本報杭州十九日訊〕橫在浙江省前面的問題，除了經濟的問題外，交通問題也是重要的一環。在浙江省境上，除了浙贛路是唯一的鐵道外，其餘差不多都是公路的交通。戰前浙江省的公路路面好，車輛好，所以在全國的公路中可佔數一數二的位置。可是抗戰八年來，因着戰事的轉進，公路頻遭破壞，戰後浙省的公路交通已達到了支離破碎的局面　　浙省原本有個交通處管理公路的，而經費短絀，顧此失彼，後來把交通處，改為公路局，也還是捉襟見肘。於是省府想盡辦法，把公路的運輸交通交給商人經營，但是因為時局的一時未能安全，以致運輸上的揩油偷漏，層見疊出，損耗賠累，繼之而來，幾輛破舊的車輛來貫通浙省的動脈，總究覺得太草率了。　　後來，浙省與中央合作，由公路總局與省府訂立合同，成立了浙江省的公路聯營處，省公路局僅將接收一部份敵僞車輛及簡單的修理設備作為投資，餘均由公路總局的第一運輸充實並負責經營。省公路局就可專責注重在修路工程，由聯營處每月在總收入方面，　　不計盈虧　按百分之廿作為監理費用。這樣才算解決了浙省暫時的交通問題。　　這個公路聯營處自成立以後，逐漸地在成長發展，它已經營了杭州湖濱至留下，至拱震橋，至宜興，至莫干山，至拱震橋，至宜興，至莫干山，至乍浦，乍浦至嘉興，海寗至長安，崇德蘭谿至衢縣至華埠，江山至福州，義烏至麗水，杭州至蕭山，至臨浦，諸曁至楓橋婁宮，浦江至鄭家塢，杭州至寗波聯運，城站至錢江南巖聯運，共計十四路綫，長達一千五百七十一公里，每月行車三十萬公里，運輸旅客三十四萬多人，運輸貨物一千五百餘噸，各綫共配備客車九十七輛，貨車四十五輛。他們還在準備接管一般商人經營而因虧累不堪維持的路綫。　　聯勞處除了經營以上的公路綫以外，並與京滬區鐵路局辦理上海至　　京杭國道　的長興，吳興，莫干山等各站的聯運和上海至乍浦，平湖，新豐各站聯運。同時與浙贛路辦理浙閩綫上的江山，峽口，廿八都浦城，建陽，永吉，建甌，古田福州各站的聯運和義麗綫上的東陽，四路口，南馬，世雅，永康，縉雲，麗水和站聯運，同與麗溫輪船公司辦理溫州至麗水以上各地旅客貨物的聯運。他們事實上已把浙江與江西，福建，上海，南京加以溝通，同時又通往上海，溫州，寗波的三個吐納口，浙江境內的動脈都為之活絡了起來！　　我們看了以上這許多的路綫要貫通活動，當然需要的車輛也是很多的，他們在整舊成新和修舊勉用的。　　兩個原則　下，擁有一千一百九址三輛汽車，而其中的功績都應該歸功於他們的修車廠的。他們在杭州設有修車廠兩所，麗水，江山設有保養，嘉興，吳興，諸曁，浦江設有修理班。杭州的修車廠一設武林門，一設玉皇山，當以玉皇山最為完備，那裏可以大修引擎，並可翻新輪胎，每月可翻新輪胎二百套。最近聽說還想　　充實設備　期求自製配件與自製輪胎。不過，聯營處自成立以來，自也有其盈虧不能平衡的苦衷，記者曾訪問過該處處長蔡慕慈，副處長張代華，他們說從三十六年三月起至本年二月止，只有三十六年的三四九三個月是盈餘的，其他都因跟不上物價而賠本。記者再問：如果汽油再昂貴，來源更困難，現在這許多動脈是否會減少他流動的次數，他們很堅強的回答我：「我們已有準備，正在研究較抗戰時後方更改進的木炭爐子。」聯營處與第一區公路總局的杭州工程處聯絡得很好，工程處的處長易榮慶，也是有心事業的一位，我搭聯營處車輛赴留下等地，都是杭州工程處所修的路，比起三十五年初來浙江時的公路來，那不知好了多少。　　浙江公路聯營處是個新創的機構，也是交通部公路總局在試驗中設立的。就浙江的情形看，聯營處確是發揮了強大的力量，人們正寄予着深厚的期望。朱自清胞妹　服毒謀自殺　　係因子女問題所引起　　〔本報南京廿一日電〕最近逝世之名文學家朱自清之胞妹朱玉華，廿日突因與其夫社會部組訓司周司長口角，憤而吞服大量安眠藥片自殺，經送醫院灌救，迄廿一日午後，病勢已見轉佳，現仍在加意診治中。朱女士現年四十歲，在江寗師範任教職，有子女六人，此次口角，卽由子女所引起。浙江公路聯營運輸處修理廠利用特種儀器驗發電機情形川簡陽大血案　陳立三被廝殺　鄉協會大報仇　　〔本報成都十七日訊〕中國鄉村文化協會理事長陳立三，為成立該會簡陽分會，一日偕會員徐紹初，吳光亮，王世鈺赴該縣西平鄉主持成立典禮。正舉行大會時，突有該鄉鄉長劉朝章率武裝隊丁多人，包圍會場，並當場槍殺陳四人。事後卽有金堂該會會員數百人，申言為陳等復仇，包圍該鄉公所，焚毀劉朝章私宅，劉於混亂中潛逃無蹤。該鄉卽陷入空前大混亂，會員與隊丁各擁數千人展開血戰，迄今仍在持續中，雙方死傷不少。十七日，鄉協會已電請飭川省府緝兇究辦，並電總會及各地分會一致申援緝兇。川省府以簡陽毗連成都，竟發生此空前大血案，更使演成大規模械鬥，地方治安不堪聞問，已派一區專員馮均逸，三區專員劉厚甫兩大員，率簡陽華陽兩縣長，會同前往查辦。袖珍新聞　　鎮江　　〔本報訊〕省府為獎勵人民建屋，將闢市民新村，並組織委員會，主辦其事，已指定舊體育場，西南城根，鼓樓崗，三官塘以北各地區為新村地址，其計劃及獎助辦法已經訂定。　　常熟　　〔本報訊〕哄動一時之東唐市警分局集體貪污案，由地院訊結判決，分局長楊篤敬，局員楊正元，各處有期徒刑四年，巡官徐繼鴻，警長徐鴻志，各處有期徒刑十二年。　　松江　　〔本報訊〕此間麵館，麵坊，因原料無法購進，相率停市，豆腐業以黃豆難買，亦均無法營業。　　崑山　　〔本報訊〕參議會第六次大會，於二十日上午，在中山堂舉行，討論追加下半年度預算，曁田賦附加率，學谷捐征收辦法，以及三一減租等要案。　　宜興　　〔本報訊〕本城大德，永昌兩糧行，於十七日深夜準備船只，分裝大批糧食，私運出境，旋由崗警扣押，並將負責人解縣質詢。　　蚌埠　　〔本報訊〕省公路局勝利二號快輪，於十六日上午，駛經黃炭窑伊家溝附近，被潛匪八十餘嗚槍，迫令停駛，大肆搜刦，乘客損失甚鉅，匪臨行時，將該輪管理員及一彭姓軍官帶去。鐵都鞍山　收復前後　　〔本報瀋陽十七日航訊〕鐵部鞍山的收復，是東北局勢的一個轉捩點，打下鞍山的國軍，是接收東北的第一支軍的五十二軍，當時他們從熱帶跑到了冰天雪地的東北，單夾哀，草鞋片，猛追奔逐，給東北人們留下了很深的印象。　　「出其不意，攻其不備」，這是兵家戰勝的要訣，這次鞍山的收復，的確做到了這一點。劉玉章軍長——出關時五十二軍第二師師長，計劃好了攻擊步驟，得到了批准，在發動的前兩天，對他的弟兄們說：「東北局面，千鈞一髪，「疾風如勁草，亂世辨忠奸，」沒別的，我們要抓住報効的時機」，部下給他一個擁護的回答。　　十月六日的拂曉，劉玉章指揮大軍出動，所以他來了個迅雷不及掩耳的包圍行動，原先在遼陽西南劉二堡（鞍山西北）的一支軍隊，銜敉疾走，曉到了鞍山以南，登時佔領了匪後的騰　堡等重要據點，斷了匪的去路。　　另外一部隊伍，向東南迂迴，伸展至鞍山東南的大石頭，孤山子制高點，中鋒則沿鐵道綫佔領了沙河，立山等車站，包圍態勢已成，鞍山整個陷入了他們的控制之中。　　鞍山匪獨二師的第六團，長江支隊兩個團，以及軍分區的警衛團等，共計四個團，在鞍山東南的高官嶺·鐵架山等邱陵山帶，被國軍打得落花流水，死的死，傷的傷，俘的俘，逃出的很有限，此外匪獨二師第六團，因駐紥鞍山以南，漏綱中逃向海城。　　九月中旬，劉部於遼陽西南劉二堡一役，擊潰匪五千餘，收獲頗大，今又有鞍山之捷，劉說：「遼南介乎野戰軍和地方武力之間的匪眾力量，被擊潰了，遼南殘匪除了再來增援部隊，是沒有活動餘地了。」　　鞍山收復了，鋼鐵幫經過資委會投資費力修整的殘餘機械，還很完整，現在當然沒有力量，同時也不能談到大部份復工，但，部份的開工，以保存機器，不使朽爛或破壞下去，是值得的，是必要的。　　鋼鐵廠的發電所，已修整的機械，只要把煤運到，就可以發九千多基瓦的電力，其他的，像機器，鑄造等小型廠，也可以先從事於部份的工作，救工廠，救工人，并間接救濟沒飯吃的市民，都需急辦。　　當然，目前困難很多，第一個是鞍山站在第一綫，瀋陽南下火車，僅能到達太子河岸，太子河大橋現尙未修，遼陽到鞍山間雖有鐵路·車皮·但無車頭，以致龐大的火車運輸力量以及煤礦·和瀋陽還沒能銜接在一起，一切還待局勢再開展，再好轉！</p>

<h3>Northeastern Strategic Showdown Begins: National Army Advances According to Plan; Bandits Concentrate Five Columns to Attack Jinxi</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 21st] The National Army and the bandits in the Northeast have begun a strategic showdown, with the National Army advancing according to plan. The bandits have also decided to continue attacking and harassing Jinxi and Huludao. The National Army's westward advance contingent from Shenyang is pressing toward Heishan and Fuxin from Xinlidan. The southward contingent appears to be taking action again, with battles expected in Haicheng and Yingkou, which may soon fall into the National Army's grasp. As for the bandit attacks and harassment against Jinxi, it has been demonstrated that a portion of the bandit's 11th Column began attacking National Army strongholds in the northwest of Jinxi on the evening of the 19th. The bandit 4th Column launched a counterattack from Tashan against the National Army attacking Tashan, with extremely fierce fighting. Furthermore, the bandit 3rd Column, after fleeing from Jinzhou, has moved to the area west of Tashan, and the 7th Column is also at Tashan. Additionally, the 9th Column has detoured west to the area around the Da Xiao Ying River mouth north of Xingcheng. Currently, east of Jinxi, there are parts of the bandit 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 11th Columns, while west of Jinxi, the 9th Column has moved from Jinzhou. The bandits have concentrated five columns of troops around Jinxi, demonstrating considerable ambition. Jinxi is defended by newly arrived elite National Army troops, who will engage in a tough battle with the bandits, which may become the decisive battleground. The sound of gunfire is becoming increasingly intense, and the air force is constantly flying over to conduct reconnaissance and bombing. The scale of the battle will surpass that of Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tangshan, 21st] A portion of the new army, which had received American-style training in Taiwan, arrived in Tangshan on the 20th and was immediately deployed to reinforce the nearby transportation lines, further stabilizing the situation in eastern Hebei.

<h3>Zheng Dongguo Cables President, Resolves to Preserve National Integrity</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 21st] The Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters released a Changchun battle report: The Bandit Suppression Headquarters recently received a cable from General Zheng Dongguo, commander of the Changchun garrison, to the President at 11:00 PM on the 20th, the original text of which is as follows: "At 7:00 PM on October 19th, I personally cabled to report that I, leading Deputy Chief of Staff Yang Youmei, the headquarters, and the entire officer corps of the special service regiment (two battalions), along with Provincial Government Secretary Cui Chuiyan, totaling about one thousand people, firmly defended the Central Bank. On October 19th, in a day of fierce fighting, we killed or wounded 300 bandits, while we suffered over a hundred casualties. The night became quiet, but small groups of bandits continued to approach, attempting a surprise attack, all of which were repelled. From this morning until 5:00 PM, there were only sporadic battles. After dusk, the bandits suddenly launched a fierce attack, taking advantage of their superior artillery fire to seize field fortifications within dozens of steps of our Central Bank building. The soldiers defending the outer perimeter all heroically sacrificed themselves. We are now only defending the interior of the building, with dwindling troops and ammunition. The overall situation cannot be salvaged, resulting in the loss of the revolution, which I deeply regret. I will abide by your teachings, fulfill my military duty, preserve national integrity, and not disgrace your mandate. However, the country is in great difficulty, and I deeply regret that I cannot continue to follow you and share your burdens in completing the revolutionary cause. Time is pressing. I respectfully report this by cable, Zheng Dongguo, personally sealed at 11:00 PM on the night of October 20th."</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, answered the following questions at a press conference on the 21st:</p>
<p>(1) We believe that Mr. Lai Parkhan's remarks have encouraging implications. Mr. Lai advocated that aid to China should be long-term, just as the Marshall Plan for Europe should be implemented for a full four years. If this recommendation can be realized, it will further enable us to overcome the current difficulties. China's suppression of the rebellion is not only for its own benefit, but also for maintaining the democratic status of the entire Asia. Then, as a result of its struggle, the United States will continue to aid China, coupled with China's own efforts, which will be sufficient to determine the inevitable end of the communist bandits.</p>
<p>(2) As of September 20th, the total value of gold, silver, and foreign currency exchanged by the government was US$131,333,279.</p>
<p>(3) According to news from the National Treasury Bureau and the Central Bank, as of October 18th, the five major state-owned enterprises sold shares in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Taiwan, totaling 4,419,700 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>"United Nations Day": We Celebrate Together</h3>
<p>During the press conference, Director Dong also stated that the 24th is the third anniversary of the implementation of the United Nations Charter. Countries around the world have designated this day as "United Nations Day" to commemorate it, and our country also intends to celebrate it together. In today's turbulent world situation, the United Nations is undoubtedly a sign of a bright future for the world. We must understand this meaning when commemorating United Nations Day.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the United Nations, China has fully supported this organization and all its constructive affiliated institutions, and will continue to support it. China will unconditionally support all perfect plans that can promote and strengthen the purposes of this great organization.</p>

<h3>Premier Weng Convenes Meeting: Comprehensive Review of Economic Situation; Remedial Measures Have Been Decided; Price Limits Deemed Unreasonable Will Be Adjusted; Daily Necessities Will Be Rationed With Coupons on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Executive Yuan Premier Weng Wenhao convened a meeting at the Premier's Residence No. 1 on the morning of the 21st, bringing together Wang Yunwu, Guan Jiyu, Li Weiguo, Xu Baoguo, Shen Yi, and Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. The economic situation since the currency reform and other issues were all discussed thoroughly, and a number of measures to remedy past shortcomings have been decided and will be implemented soon. During the discussion, it was generally agreed that the current phenomenon of panic buying was not due to a lack of supplies, but rather to merchants challenging price limits. To remedy this, reasonable adjustments will be proactively made to those price limits that were unreasonable in the past to give producers legitimate profits. However, after reasonable adjustments, merchants must not use this as an excuse to evade supplies. At the same time, the principle of freezing should still be maintained. Regarding the increase in production, in addition to partially opening up the use of self-provided foreign exchange to allow the import of production equipment, the government will also provide various assistance to production enterprises as much as possible. In addition, Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo reported on the measures for adjusting the supply of materials for daily necessities in Nanjing and Shanghai, which were jointly formulated by merchants in Shanghai. Liu and Jiang returned to Shanghai by plane in the afternoon after attending the meeting. (Please see the news "Comprehensive Plan to Improve the Economy" on page 2)</p>

<h3>President and Wife Visit Fragrant Hills; Visit Orphanage and Donate Candy Fee of 1,000 Yuan; Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces Guo Chan Summoned and Flew to Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces Guo Chan, accompanied by Director of the Transportation Department Zhao Guixie, etc., flew to Beiping on a special plane at 2:30 PM on the 20th after being summoned by the President.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 21st] President Chiang and his wife went to Fragrant Hills at 4:00 PM on the 21st to visit the Fragrant Hills Children's Welfare Institute founded by Xiong Xiling. Over a hundred people including the director, teachers, and students of the institute cheered and jumped for joy when they heard that the President and his wife were coming. They stepped forward and Mrs. Chiang smiled and asked, "How are the President and his wife?" The President replied with a smile, "Hello, children!" Then they inspected the classrooms and dormitories and inquired about the director's recent situation with the teachers before returning to the residence at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 21st] President Chiang and his wife made an unannounced visit to the Fragrant Hills Children's Welfare Institute at 4:00 PM this afternoon. After the President and his wife got out of the car and entered the institute, they successively visited the infant care institute, the family department, and the kindergarten.

The President's wife also took the children's little hands and asked them if they were living well. After the visit, they also stayed at Jingyiyuan for a long time. When they left, the night had already fallen, and the President and his wife donated 1,000 gold yuan to the children of the institute for candy.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 21st] According to Yang Qingzhi, director of the Beiping authorities, President Chiang was very concerned about Beiping's police affairs during this visit to Beiping and gave many instructions on reforms.

<h3>National Assembly to Review Current Situation Tomorrow Morning: Plenary Session of All Members to Be Held; Thirteenth Meeting Today to Continue Processing Backlogged Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold a plenary session of all members on the morning of the 23rd to review the current situation. A United Nations Day celebration will be held on the morning of the 24th, and Mr. Chen Lifu will be invited to deliver a speech.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The thirteenth meeting of the second session of the National Assembly is scheduled to be held on the 22nd. The discussion items listed on the agenda are all backlogged cases that have not been processed in previous meetings. There is also only one report item, namely the report from the Financial, Economic Resources, and Civil Law Committees on the joint review and amendment of the draft inheritance tax law. Because various tax rates have changed after the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree, it is proposed that the government's written replies to the inquiries related to the first and second secret meetings of the National Assembly be awaited. The proposal made by Cheng Tianfang and others to request the government to promptly submit various changed tax rates to the Assembly for review in order to complete the legislative process will be considered after the results are obtained so that there can be a basis for review.</p>
<p>Wang Fuzhou Attends Financial Committee to Report on Northeast Financial Problems</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly's Financial Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 21st. Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, attended to report on the Northeast financial problems and answer inquiries. According to Wang, the Central Bank branches had no choice but to issue a large number of promissory notes. The quantity and rate of expansion made it impossible for the government to allow the gold yuan to circulate in Changchun after the currency reform. If the circulating certificates were exchanged for gold yuan, the entire amount of gold yuan issued would be exhausted in a few months. Therefore, after careful consideration, the government decided to issue military grain coupons. Although there were also military grain coupons in Shenyang, they were debt instruments and could not be circulated, so there would be no adverse consequences. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has sent a telegram to stop the establishment of official silver houses in various parts of the Northeast. After answering questions, Wang left, and the meeting proceeded to discuss the draft National Treasury Law. It was amended and passed according to the preliminary review opinions and will be submitted to the Assembly for a final decision.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Met Yesterday; Minister Wang and Others Did Not Attend</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly's Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was originally scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 21st to hear reports from Minister Wang of the Ministry of Finance and President Yu on overseas remittances and the collection and sale of foreign currency from overseas Chinese. When the convening committee met, fearing that too few members would attend in the afternoon, it was decided to notify Minister Wang and President Yu that they did not need to attend. To the surprise of the committee, the number of committee members attending in the afternoon was unexpectedly large, and as many as seventeen or eighteen reporters rushed to listen in. The chairman of the meeting, Huang Zhezhen, repeatedly sent the secretary to find and invite Wang and Yu, but the members waited for a long time and still could not find them. For a time, there was quite a bit of complaining, and some angrily accused Minister Wang and President Yu of looking down on the National Assembly. After Huang repeatedly explained and took the blame as the convener, the matter was dropped, and the grand meeting was declared a failure.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From Monetary Tightness to Floating Capital and Prices</h3>
<p>The money supply in this city was once so loose that it was difficult to lend out even at interest rates of two or three percent. Recently, however, it has suddenly tightened, and the monthly interest rate has risen to nine or fifteen percent. For long-term lending, it has even exceeded thirty percent. According to those in the industry, it is unlikely that the situation will ease in the very short term. There are many reasons for this, but the main reason is the outflow of floating capital.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the abundance of floating capital necessitates urgent guidance. Otherwise, it will pose a significant threat to general prices. Although price controls in this city have been effective and have largely maintained the "August 19" level, the lack of proper outlets has ultimately forced the outflow of large amounts of capital, leading to monetary tightening and soaring black market interest rates. This is not unexpected.</p>
<p>To stabilize the market, it is up to the national banks to manage the current issue of capital, adjusting surpluses and deficits to facilitate the turnover of legitimate industries and businesses. This should not be difficult to resolve. The real problem is how to absorb the surplus capital. Accumulating it in this city or diverting it to other places is merely a regional transfer and does not substantively solve the problem. Recently, prices in Guangzhou and the Southwest have soared, and materials on the inland railway lines are being hidden, preventing exchange between urban and rural areas, and farmers are unwilling to bring agricultural products to market. This illustrates the severity of the problem!</p>
<p>The central authorities have announced that they have developed a comprehensive plan to guide floating capital. The specific measures include the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, the sale of enemy, puppet, and surplus properties, the issuance of gold yuan treasury bills and jewelry lottery tickets, and the increase in capital of banks and firms. In addition, there are proposals to issue corporate bonds, gold yuan government bonds, and allow state-owned enterprise stocks to be guaranteed interest. We believe that any measure, if it is to be attractive and encourage the investment of floating capital, must grasp two key points: (1) preferential returns; (2) ease of resale. The recent large outflow of floating capital proves the validity of the first point, while the sales or disposals of other items, except for jewelry lottery tickets, have not been as successful as desired, which also shows that the second point is indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Market interest rates have been limited by the government and should be gradually reduced. Financial authorities in various regions are also paying close attention to this and working hard to suppress them. The amount of inward remittances and cash carried has been restricted and strictly inspected, but the outflow of capital has not been completely curbed. This also reflects that where the profit is, water flows downward, and relying solely on laws may not be effective.</p>
<p>Finance is like blood, running through the entire body of economic life. It is especially sensitive and stimulating, and its fluctuations and flows greatly affect the general economy. In the early days of the new currency, the government's biggest goals are to consolidate the currency value and strictly enforce price controls. Stabilizing the currency value and prices cannot be achieved without stabilizing finance at the same time. Therefore, the high lending rates reflect the urgency of the floating capital problem.</p>
<p>Premier Weng recently declared in the Legislative Yuan that he would reorganize the market, and his method is to do everything possible to crack down on hoarding and profiteering, dredge up the source of materials, and impose reasonable price limits according to the principles of fairness. Minister Wang also listed five measures to stabilize prices, which is naturally what everyone is eagerly looking forward to. However, price changes, the rise and fall of hoarding, and whether price limits can be maintained are closely related to the amount of floating capital. This can be proven by the hoarding situation in the legal tender era and the recent price surge in Guangzhou. Even the recent buying frenzy in various places, although extremely scattered, does not seem to be hoarding, but it may not be a method of breaking it up into smaller parts. Also, the rush to buy has increased the demand for funds, which has strengthened the tightening of monetary policy and the rise of dark interest. Therefore, interest rates and floating capital, floating capital and hoarding, and hoarding and prices form a chain relationship. If any link is improperly adjusted and an abnormal phenomenon occurs, it will affect the other parts. We hope that the authorities' plan to guide floating capital can be released as soon as possible and work in conjunction with price stabilization measures to achieve a mutually beneficial effect.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Has Prepared Methods for Overall Economic Improvement; Secretary-General of the Huazhong Bandit Suppression Headquarters Political Affairs Committee Announces</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 21st] Yuan Shouyi, Secretary-General of the Political Affairs Committee of the Huazhong Bandit Suppression Headquarters, invited the press on the morning of the 21st to hold a forum to solicit management opinions. Speakers were very enthusiastic, and all agreed that the incompetence and perfunctoriness of local governments are a major factor in creating economic chaos.

<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 21st] The person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce here recently visited Huo Baoshu, the Economic Supervision and Guidance Officer of Tongling, and requested that "in order to adapt to the actual market situation, some prices should be changed from limited prices to negotiated prices, otherwise some commercial firms will not be able to maintain themselves."

<h3>Taiwan Prices Rise Madly; Taipei Business Community Asks to Restore Flexible Adjustment of Taiwan Currency; Measures for Rationing Daily Necessities Decided</h3>
<p>Taipei [Our Correspondent, 21st] Following the buying frenzy, prices in Taipei are rising madly. Today, the price of rice is 420 yuan per Taiwan catty. Sugar and oil are not available for purchase. Other items such as cigarettes and cloth have risen by an average of 80 percent. Illegal black markets for gold and U.S. dollars have reached alarming levels. General opinion is that the convening of the Exposition and the Engineers' Association has aggravated the sensitive psychology of merchants regarding the disparity in the supply of materials. Official opinion is that it is affected by the mainland, and is currently considering making household rations more widespread to ease people's minds. The Taipei business community held an emergency meeting today and telegraphed Chairman Wei, requesting the central government to restore the flexible adjustment of the Taiwan currency.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang [Our Correspondent, 21st] The overall rationing of daily necessities in Zhenjiang has been decided by the various trade associations today, and will be implemented starting on the first of next month. The quantities are three dou of rice per month for each large household, one liang of oil per day, half a jin of sugar per month, one zhi five chi of cloth every three months (military and public personnel have separate supply offices), six bars of soap per month, ten small packs of matches per month, and four liang of kerosene per day. Except for sugar, soap, and kerosene, where there is no distinction between large and small households, and matches, which small children are not entitled to, the rest are halved for small households.</p>
<p>Wuxi [Our Correspondent, 21st] Oil factories have only 2,000 dan of oil in stock, which is not enough to supply military and civilian use. Today, in response to the request of more than 300 wineries and sauce shops in the city, they were allowed to allocate more than 100 dan at a time. In addition, before August 19, there were 900,000 dan of wheat and 800,000 dan of rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains stored in Wuxi. Now there are only 300,000 dan in total, a huge difference. Now another 20% of rice and grains, about 20,000 shi, is being extracted to supply for sale at flat prices, temporarily maintaining food for the people. In addition, 15 industries, including rice, wheat, flour, sugar, oil, cigarettes, paper, and yarn, have prepared to form a joint distribution agency, which will soon purchase and distribute.</p>
<p>Suzhou [Our Correspondent, 21st] A panic suddenly broke out in Suzhou over the past few days, with rice shops having no goods to supply the market. In rural areas, the strong would rob the rice being transported to the city halfway. Flour is also in short supply. Although there are 18 groups of food supply offices, the quantity is small and the rice is of poor quality, and the crowding of buyers prevents it from being widespread. The competent authorities have now decided to implement comprehensive rationing, starting with major daily necessities such as rice, flour, oil, and cloth.</p>
<p>Changshu [Our Correspondent, 21st] Materials are extremely scarce in the urban area here, and the black market in various villages is extremely rampant. Some unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to refuse to sell, and secretly transport them to the villages at night in order to seek high prices. In view of this, the county authorities have set up checkpoints at important water and land transportation routes, and have successively seized a large number of materials, including cotton yarn, flour, peanuts, yellow wine, and white candle oil, and handed them over to the police for handling. In addition, it is stipulated that people must not buy more than two days' worth of daily necessities to show restrictions.</p>
<p>Nantong [Our Correspondent, 21st] The Suppression and Construction Team is stepping up its economic inspection work. It has investigated and found many cases of scalpers and black market traders in the past few days, and imposed penalties of detention and parading through the streets. A trial sale of fresh meat by public auction was launched on the 21st. The stock of sugar is low, and it will be suspended for one day on the 22nd. Distribution will begin on the 23rd, limited to new mothers and patients.</p>
<p>Jiangyin [Our Correspondent, 21st] Merchants from Nantong often purchase large quantities of rice and grains from Wuxi at Huangtiangang, and ship them out in a steady stream. The inspection office did not intercept them because the documents were complete. Now Fortress Commander Dai has ordered that rice ships be temporarily banned from exporting until they are investigated and unbanned. In addition, the inspection office found that Ji Guangming, a native of Jingjiang, was smuggling a large number of silver ornaments out of the country, and handed them over to the Fortress Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Xiamen [Our Correspondent, 21st] Recently, many soldiers without badges have been found in the market, buying items by force and not paying. Three cases occurred yesterday alone. In order to avoid losses, department stores all closed today and sent representatives to visit the municipal authorities to request a ban. The Chamber of Commerce yesterday invited the responsible persons of the garrison to hold a symposium to jointly discuss restriction measures.</p>
<p>Hangzhou [Our Correspondent, 21st] The Zhejiang Provincial Materials Inspection Association has been established, with Du Wei as the chairman and Mai Peicheng and nine others as members. A Materials Regulation Committee will also be formed to regulate grains, cotton cloth, edible oil, sugar, industrial raw materials and other items. The material shortage in Hangzhou is still severe, and the buying frenzy has spread to all industries. The sale of rice is still scarce, and the store windows are empty. However, Mayor Zhou said that the panic over rice can be eliminated, and Jiangxi rice will continue to come to Hangzhou. The police will send personnel to supervise the sale of rice, and material inspections will continue to be carried out strictly.</p>
<p>Tianjin [Our Correspondent, 21st] Monetary policy in Tianjin is extremely tight. Even 100 yuan is difficult to withdraw from ordinary firms, so prices have stabilized, but it is extremely deserted.</p>
<p>Xi'an [Our Correspondent, 21st] Ticket prices for theaters and movies in Xi'an will be adjusted starting today to 5.5 jinyuan per ticket, more than three times higher than on August 19.</p>
<p>Chongqing [Our Correspondent, 21st] The Chongqing Economic Inspection Team was established today, with Yan Qi, Director of the Investigation Division of the Police Department, as the team leader, and Shi Shemin, Director of the Police Bureau, as the deputy team leader, unified implementation.</p>
<p>Chengdu [Our Correspondent, 21st] Due to the slow transportation of goods from Shanghai, prices in Chengdu have risen again today. Department stores, cloth, cotton yarn, rice, oil, and miscellaneous grains have generally risen by 50 percent. The Economic Management Committee has become a mere formality.</p>
<h3>Central Bank of Guizhou Again Commits Fraud in Gold Redemption; Manager Colludes with Appraisers in Cahoots; Underreporting Purchases and Overreporting Sales Found to Be True</h3>
<p>[Our Guilin Correspondent, 21st] The Guizhou Central Bank's currency case is not yet over, and now there is a gold case. Wu Guangming, the bank's manager, colluded with appraisers to commit fraud. When redeeming gold, they lowered the fineness and then raised the fineness when transferring accounts. It was reported secretly, and the supervisor Liao Heming went to the bank to investigate. The investigation found that three gold bars received by the bank on the 12th of this month were received at 82 percent fineness and transferred at 93 percent fineness, proving that they were undoubtedly committing fraud. More than 9,000 taels of gold received by the bank have been sealed by Supervisor Liao. Appraiser Luo Jitai and the owner of the gold shop, Ming Qi, fled upon hearing the news. His brothers Luo Xingyuan and Luo Zhaolin have been detained by the District Procuratorate. This case will be revealed soon.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The currency case that caused a sensation here seems to be coming to an end. Li Mo, the auditor sent by the head office to investigate the case, said that (1) there was no evidence of corruption in the accounts of the Central Bank; (2) The head office's telegram on August 21 did not specify whether it should be announced, so Wu Guangming is not legally responsible for whether or not it is announced. (3) It is rumored that the Central Bank went to other ports to collect nickel coins, but the transportation cost was too expensive, so it was not possible. The problem of purchasing and profiting locally is not serious. (3) The Central Bank originally had more than 19,000 yuan in nickel coins, which was verified by the District Procuratorate to have been stored in Guiyang before Guizhou fell, and returned after the recovery, and was reported to the head office before the currency change.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Lottery Tickets Flashed Briefly; Those Who Missed Out in Chengdu Filed Reports</h3>

<h3>Hu Shi Sends Letter to All National Assembly Members, Suggesting the Formulation of Municipal Autonomy Law Procedures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Hu Shi, Chairman of the Beiping and Tianjin Civic Autonomy Promotion Association, specially sent a letter to all National Assembly members today regarding the formulation of the Municipal Autonomy Law. The original letter reads: The Beiping and Tianjin Civic Autonomy Promotion Association passed a resolution at its annual meeting on the 3rd of this month, "Please the Legislative Yuan to formulate municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy regulations as soon as possible." Because we feel that cities (especially directly-administered municipalities) are the centers of modern culture in our country, the most densely populated areas, with highly developed industry and commerce, and a higher level of public knowledge, it seems easier to start democratic politics in cities. Article 28 of the Constitution stipulates that "the autonomy of directly-administered municipalities shall be determined by law," and specifies that directly-administered municipalities may formulate autonomy laws based on the autonomy regulations. The status of directly-administered municipalities should be comparable to that of provinces. Articles 64 and 91 of the Constitution also mention provinces and directly-administered municipalities together. Some provincial capitals have smaller populations and lower cultures than directly-administered municipalities, so we advocate that the autonomy of directly-administered municipalities should at least be equal to the autonomy of provinces. Therefore, from the standpoint of promoting civic autonomy, this association makes the following suggestions to your esteemed hospital regarding the formulation of the Municipal Autonomy Law: The Legislative Yuan formulates municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy regulations in accordance with Articles 28 and 128 of the Constitution. Municipalities or directly-administered municipalities may convene a citizens' representative assembly to formulate municipal autonomy laws in accordance with municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy regulations. After the municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy law is formulated, it will be submitted to the Judicial Yuan. If the Judicial Yuan believes that there is no violation of the Constitution, the autonomy law will be effective. The above is our humble opinion, respectfully offered to your colleagues in the hospital.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu's Lecture at Zhejiang University: Liberalism and China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st] Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, arrived in Hangzhou on the 18th. On the 20th, at the invitation of Zhu Kezhen, the president of Zhejiang University, he gave a lecture at the Zhejiang University gymnasium on the topic of "Liberalism and China." Mr. Hu first explained that liberalism is one of the greatest movements in the world today. He then elaborated on the liberalist thought of ancient Chinese Confucian scholars. From Confucius and Mencius downwards, such wise men as Wang Chong, Wang Anshi, Zhu Shunshui, and Huang Lizhou all had liberalist thoughts in their works. Therefore, what is called "liberalism" today is actually a "domestic product and not an imported product" of China. However, if there is only "liberalist thought" or "liberalist philosophy" without freedom in the political environment, then society still has no freedom to speak of, and China lacks this kind of political freedom. However, to obtain political freedom, there must be a spirit of tolerance to match it, and then liberalism can be perfectly realized. Therefore, the main demand for the victory of liberalism in China today lies in striving for political freedom and cultivating a general spirit of tolerance in society.</p>

<h3>Three Powers Accept Neutral Nations' Compromise Proposal - Turning Point in Berlin Problem - Vyshinsky Cables Kremlin for Instructions, Awaiting Reply - Security Council to Resume Discussion Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] The three Western powers decided on the 21st to accept the so-called mediation plan of neutral nations, celebrating the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the West giving up its accusations against the Soviet Union of threatening peace. Thus, a turning point in the Berlin crisis suddenly opened up a bright future. The compromise plan proposed by the neutral nations advocates that the Soviet Union first lift the Berlin blockade, and then the four powers will once again discuss the Berlin currency and the German peace treaty. According to reports, after several consultations between Argentine representative Bramuglia, chairman of the Security Council, and Soviet representative Vyshinsky, the compromise was drafted and submitted to Vyshinsky and Western countries this morning. Vyshinsky immediately forwarded it to Moscow so that the Kremlin's reply could be received before the Security Council resumes its discussion on the Berlin crisis tomorrow. Western representatives believe that they are very willing for the Soviet Union to recognize the plan as a "promising basis" to resolve the East-West crisis. Rumors of the West's reluctance to urgently accuse the Soviet Union have been circulating for many days, but the blockade of Berlin must be lifted. Therefore, when Vyshinsky stood up in the Security Council to request access to the compromise proposal, the hope of peacefully resolving the crisis suddenly increased. The compromise plan has not yet been finalized. According to information, there are the following three methods: (1) unconditionally lift the Berlin blockade; (2) the four powers will re-discuss the Berlin currency system, or it will be held at the same time as the lifting of the blockade; (3) after the blockade is lifted and before the currency system problem is resolved, the four foreign ministers will hold another meeting to discuss the German problem. Because Bramuglia had several meetings with Vyshinsky, it is generally believed that breaking the deadlock is still possible. Based on this, the West no longer insists that the United Nations declare to the world that the Soviet Union is a threat to peace. A Western diplomat said, "We hope to lift the Berlin blockade. Now that the method of lifting the blockade has been found, we are also unwilling to argue too much with the Soviet Union, because the blockade is a threat to peace." As both sides have adopted new positions, the wording of the neutral nations' plan is also becoming more active rather than passive. In short, the current focus is on lifting the blockade rather than condemning the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Rumors are rife that Molotov will come to Paris within twelve days, and these rumors may become a reality.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 20th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with British Ambassador Peterson on the 20th for a 45-minute meeting.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Representatives of various countries at the United Nations today received a white paper on the German issue issued by the Polish Embassy in London. The introduction to the book stated that the German issue can only be resolved through the agreement of the four powers and by respecting the reasonable demands of Germany's neighboring countries issued by the German Embassy. Poland opposes the policy of dividing Europe and dividing spheres of influence. Poland insists that European countries should cooperate equally and reciprocally in the United Nations organization.</p>
<h3>Political Committee Passes Mexican Proposal - Draft Declaration of Friendship and Understanding - Dulles Guarantees Willingness to Seek Cooperation with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] When the UN General Assembly Political Committee met today, the Mexican representative proposed that major powers should strive to resolve differences between countries in order to achieve lasting peace. This motion was unanimously passed by the committee, creating an unprecedented atmosphere of harmony. The first to express support for this motion was US representative Dulles (Republican foreign policy advisor). He said that the US representatives welcome the Mexican representative's proposal and accept the basic principles in the bill.</p>
<p>We are deeply aware that countries that have made great contributions to the victory of the war should have the right to make active and constructive contributions. If this right is not used, all member states of the United Nations will be concerned about the consequences. In other words, major powers not only have the right, but also have the obligation. If major powers do not properly fulfill this obligation, other countries should pay attention to this matter. He also said that the reason for the breakdown of the first foreign ministers' meeting was that "one of the three participating countries hoped to prevent the other two countries among the five from participating in the drafting of the treaty." The implication is that the Soviet Union attempted to prevent China and France from participating in the discussion of the treaties with Germany's satellite states. He finally guaranteed that the United States will strive to seek cooperation with the Soviet Union. Representatives of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union suggested that a subcommittee including the five powers and Mexico should be established to draft a declaration of friendship and understanding. Therefore, the subcommittee was immediately established and authorized to draft a bill of friendship and understanding to be submitted to the Political Committee.</p>
<h3>West Berlin Prepares for General Election</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 21st broadcast, Berlin dispatch: Regardless of Soviet opposition, Western and German authorities began to implement plans to hold elections in Berlin on the 21st. Officials said that even if the Soviet occupation zone prevents the election, Germans in the western occupied zones will vote on December 5 to elect a new municipal government. Although Berlin city officials and Western Allied commanders are worried that the election will result in two municipal governments, they are still determined to proceed. Soviet commander of Berlin, Kotikov, informed acting Mayor Friedensburg that unless West Berlin restores democracy and reunites, he will not allow elections to be held. US Commander of Berlin, Colonel Holay, criticized Kotikov's remarks as nonsense, saying, "I am used to listening to Soviet arguments. I dare say Kotikov has rejected the election." He pointed out that the Soviet Union does not hold elections because it fears that Germans will thus have the opportunity to announce their views to the world.</p>
<h3>White House Holds National Defense Conference - Clay Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Washington, 21st broadcast: US Military Governor of Germany Clay, Secretary of the Army Royall, and Chief of Staff Bradley had a brief meeting with Truman on the morning of the 21st to discuss the situation in Germany. Clay was then invited to attend the regular meeting of the National Defense Conference held at the White House.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] US Commander-in-Chief of the Occupied Forces in Germany Clay arrived here today. During his brief visit, he will meet with officials from the State Department and is scheduled to deliver a speech in New York once. Acting Secretary of State Lovett said that he will take advantage of Clay's return to the country to obtain the latest information on the Berlin airlift and other German occupation issues. Clay told reporters that his return visit did not involve "urgent matters." He said that he hopes to meet with Secretary of the Army Royall and Acting Secretary of State Lovett, but said that such meetings are only routine.</p>
<p>He said: "Archbishop Spellman invited me to speak at the Smith dinner, which is the only reason I returned home."</p>
<h3>South Korean Rebel Police Brigade Retreating South Toward Gurye - South Gwangju Government Defeats Motley Rebel Army</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Korean troops and police loyal to the government defeated a motley rebel army led by communists south of Suncheon on the 21st. The main force of the rebel army, about 3,800 people, is said to have fled into the mountains.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The US military headquarters announced at noon today that the rebel guard unit is retreating south toward Gurye. The US military headquarters abruptly broke its 36-hour silence and issued a brief statement stating that no other guard units have been reported to have taken disloyal actions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] 2,500 rebellious Korean police have completely occupied Yeosu, and have also partially occupied Suncheon, 20 miles north of Yeosu. It is said that they were blocked between Suncheon and Gurye (40 miles by air north of Yeosu) this morning. Therefore, the rumors that spread last night that the rebel army had entered 75 miles inland from the coastal city at the southwestern tip of South Korea (i.e. Yeosu) have been clarified. According to Korean Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Lee Beom-seok, two brigades of regular troops are being dispatched from Jeonju to suppress the rebellion. Senior Korean military officers, including Commander-in-Chief Song Ho, and several staff members are believed to have flown to Gwangju this morning to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] South Korean Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Lee Beom-seok declared at a press conference at noon today that government forces have taken the initiative in the operations in the southernmost part of Korea. Three companies of the army were transferred from Gwangju to the area on the 20th, and officials from the South Korean General Staff also flew from Seoul to Gwangju. According to Lee, the rebels have now fled to Chilisan (transliteration) and will adopt guerrilla tactics against the government forces. Lee criticized far-right politicians who returned from China for also participating in the rebellion. This statement was obviously referring to Kim Gu, a 73-year-old exile in China for many years and a mortal enemy of the Lee Seung-man regime. He also said that the rebel army, assisted by communist farmers, has hung the North Korean red star flag on public buildings in Yeosu.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Amid the communist uprising in Korea, the Korean Minister of the Interior has declared martial law throughout South Korea as a precautionary measure. According to the latest news, the rebellious police force has crossed Goheung, 50 miles north of Yeosu, and is attacking Gwangju. It is generally believed that the communist fifth column in Gwangju city is waiting to join the rebel army. The Minister of the Interior declared that the leading units loyal to the government are on their way to Gwangju, and a decisive battle may occur between the government forces and the rebel army in the city. He refused to say how many reinforcements were on their way to Gwangju and predicted that the rebel army could be wiped out within two weeks.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] A communiqué issued today by the US military headquarters in South Korea confirmed that the entire 2,500-member 14th Regiment of the 5th Division of the South Korean New Army in Yeosu rebelled in protest against the government's order to transfer them to Jeju Island to suppress the farmers and police on the island. The rebel army took a northbound train to occupy Songju and reached Namwon (transliteration) south of Yeosu, where they were resolutely resisted by the government's regular army and retreated back to Songju.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Local Korean military sources said on the morning of the 21st: "The rebel army is currently scattered in the area near Gwangju in southern Jeolla Province."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] The South Korean national police have been on alert since the night of the 20th and have received a large number of rifles and machine guns. The government authorities held several meetings in Seoul that night, but the situation in Seoul is still calm. According to general observers, the rebellion was caused by the South Korean people's dissatisfaction with the Lee Seung-man regime. The government may be able to quell the rebellion, but it cannot quell the growing dissatisfaction of the South Korean people forever.</p>
<h3>US State Department and Army Department Watching South Korean Rebellion - US Military Avoiding Taking Actual Action</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] US Acting Secretary of State Lovett said today that the State Department has not received any official reports on the rebellion in South Korea and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea. Another official said that the State Department and the Army Department are closely monitoring the development of the situation in Korea. He also said that if the situation there deteriorates, the commander of the US Army in South Korea can take action immediately. Diplomatic sources here said that it is difficult to believe the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea. According to sources in Washington, the masters of the Kremlin may use the instability in South Korea as an excuse to delay the withdrawal of troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] Government officials here, including army officers, believe that there is no reason to use the US military in the event of a rebellion in Korea, but it may also depend on the wishes of the Korean government. Therefore, US commanders should avoid actual action unless requested by the South Korean government led by Lee Seung-man.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes US - Undermining Agreement on Korea</h3>
<p>Korea Becomes US Military Base</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] New Times Weekly commented on the issue of "restoring diplomatic relations with the North Korean People's Government," attacking Washington politicians for undermining the Moscow agreement on Korea, saying: The United States intends to make Korea a colony of the United States for US economic expansion and as an important military strategic base in the Far East. The article pointed out that the Soviet Union's withdrawal of troops from Korea is a clear demonstration of the Soviet Union's respect for Korean sovereignty and the interests of the Korean people, just as the United States' refusal to withdraw troops is a prominent example of US imperialist expansion.</p>
<h3>Jewish Army Occupies Beersheba - Israeli Government Issues Ceasefire Order - Arab Residents Fleeing Along Bethlehem Highway</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 20th] Authoritative sources said on the 20th that the Israeli government has ordered the Jewish army in the Negev region to cease fire in order to comply with the Security Council's order. The source claimed that the ceasefire decision was decided at an emergency cabinet meeting attended for the first time by Israeli Acting President Weizmann.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 21st] Unruly elements of the Israeli army occupied Beersheba, Egypt's main base in the Holy Land, on the 21st, minutes before the Israeli government accepted the United Nations' order to cease fire in the Negev region. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization here has telegraphed this matter to Paris. An Israeli military spokesman announced that the Israeli government has ordered the commanders of the Jewish army in the Negev region of southern Palestine to "cease fire as soon as there is no war in the Negev or elsewhere." The cabinet met to draft a document accepting the Security Council's ceasefire order. He said that the acceptance statement may be telegraphed to the UN General Assembly in Paris on the 21st. The Israeli army has occupied several places in the Negev battle and is now determined to hold on to them in order to play a role when the United Nations decides how the area should be assigned. Reliable sources said that residents of several Arab villages along the Medar and Bethlehem highways have fled, so most of them have fallen into the hands of the Jewish army.</p>
<h3>After Allied Powers Sign Peace Treaty with Japan - Occupying Forces Should Still Remain - Shigeru Yoshida Announces at Foreign Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Yoshida believes that if the international situation is still as chaotic as it is now when the peace treaty with Japan is signed, then even after the peace treaty is signed, the occupying forces should still remain in Japan. Yoshida said at a foreign press conference this morning that Japan does not want to be invaded by foreign forces. If the occupying forces withdraw, Japan's domestic security will be threatened. Yoshida pointed out that Japan currently only has 125,000 policemen, whose equipment is poor and weapons are insufficient. The riot by Koreans in Kobe in March this year, which kidnapped the county magistrate, proves the weakness of the Japanese police force. However, he refused to comment on what strength the Japanese police should have. Regarding the economy, Yoshida said that he will make every effort to restore Japan's free economic system. He believes that it may be very difficult to implement a completely free economic system under the current circumstances, but he guarantees that government controls will be kept to a minimum. Yoshida also said that he will strive to restore international confidence in Japan and find ways to make the Japanese economy self-sufficient. Regarding Japanese political issues, Yoshida said: I want to dissolve the parliament. He also admitted that he has not been able to obtain a majority of votes in the parliament, so he will find it difficult to control this legislative body.</p>

<h3>New Elite of French Army Reinforces - Suppresses Coal Mine Strike Wave - Miners Occupying Jaumont Power Plant Re-Evicted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] French police re-occupied the giant power plant in Jaumont, south-central France, on the 21st after being driven out by communist-led striking miners on the 20th. At the same time, 100 army transport planes landed in Lyon, bringing new elite troops from North Africa to reinforce the Saint-Étienne coal mining basin, which is currently under the strike wave. The attack on the Jaumont power plant occurred in the early morning. Before the pickets were fully awake, police in helmets and with guns rushed through the defenses and poured into the plant. Within 30 minutes, the strikers withdrew without resistance. The coal mine strike has lasted for 18 days, and other industries have also launched sporadic strikes to strengthen its momentum. The communist-controlled dock workers' union ordered its members not to unload British and American coal in the country. In the county of Thaine, an important industrial area in southern France, the Communist General Confederation of Labor ordered a general strike with no time limit.</p>

<h3>This Month's Rice Rationing Deadline Extended - 100,000 Piculs to be Shipped to Shanghai Within the Week - Yang Chuo'an Guarantees Supply of Two-Thirds of the City's Food</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] There should be no problem with the supply of rice in the city in the short term. Yang Chuo'an, chairman of the Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, went to the supervisor's office yesterday morning to negotiate and guaranteed to supply two-thirds of the city's food. As for the remaining one-third of the rice, which is within the scope of free purchase, rice merchants are also actively purchasing from various other ports. 4,000 tons of Nanchang rice have begun to be shipped to Shanghai. The supervisor's office has telegraphed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to allocate two trains per day to transport it. Wan Molin also went to the Central Bank yesterday to contact them, requesting the operating authorities to approve 20,000 bolts of cloth foreign exchange to exchange for rice and grain from other ports. As for the supply of flour, there are still problems with raw materials.</p>
<p>After the distribution of rice for October in the city began on the 16th, citizens rushed to buy it, causing the distributed rice that was in transit to be unable to connect. Mayor Wu specially invited Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Yang of the Grain Storage and Purchase Committee, and Director Lu of the Civil Food Allocation Office to a temporary meeting in the city government reception room at 4 pm yesterday to discuss issues such as accelerating the transportation to Shanghai and the distribution of rice.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also told reporters after the meeting that 100,000 piculs of rice will be shipped to Shanghai one after another within a week. The authorities are now making every effort to dredge rice sources, so there is no fear of food panic among the people. The original dates for the sale of rice to the public in the city were from the 5th to the end of the month. Because the distribution of rice for this month began on the 16th, those with ID cards can purchase household rice until the extended deadline.</p>
<p>The authorities have also made the greatest efforts to maintain power. Although the coal shortage is still severe, coal is being actively transported from Taiwan and Huainan, supplemented by a portion of foreign coal, so there should be no concern about coal for industrial use in the next month. As for the coal dross distributed to the public, it has long been resolved.</p>
<h3>Interim Matching Method Before the Second Batch of Rice Arrives</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that many rice shops have sold out of the first batch, or only have whole rice or only have broken rice in stock, the Civil Food Adjustment Committee has decided to temporarily adopt a matching method before the second batch of rice arrives in order to facilitate the urgent needs of citizens. All rice shops with rice in stock can distribute the existing whole rice or broken rice separately. The selling price of whole rice is 1.0666 yuan (gold standard) per shi dou (peck), and the selling price of broken rice is 0.5333 yuan (gold standard) per shi dou.</p>
<h3>Cotton Sub-Committee of the Materials Adjustment Committee Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>

<h3>Public Utilities Subsidized a Total of Eight Million Yuan in September</h3>
<p>Whether or Not to Subsidize this Month is Under Review</p>
<p>The various public utility companies in this city were approved by the central government in September to receive a total of eight million gold yuan in subsidies. The funds have already been advanced by the national bank and have been claimed by the respective companies. However, whether to continue the subsidies after October or whether to approve adjustments is currently being requested from the central government by the Public Utilities Bureau, and they are awaiting orders. It is learned that the costs of public utilities have increased by 50% due to the rise in gasoline and coal prices. The original special price for fuel oil has also been changed to the general price calculation starting this month, which is more than double the previous price. The central government originally stipulated that the price of coal should be the limited price as of August 1st, but recently, due to miners' requests for adjustments, it has been decided that coal-using units of various public utilities should first pay the money and then settle the accounts later before the new price is approved, but the actual price has already increased much more than the original price.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Faces Serious Danger, Joint Meeting of Shipping Association Directors and Supervisors Decides to Send Representatives to Nanjing to Appeal</h3>
<p>〔Our Report〕Standing directors and supervisors of the Shipping Association and directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Association held a joint meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to review the difficulties in the shipping industry. All directors and supervisors agreed that the shipping industry is facing a serious crisis and that ways must be found to rescue it. (1) As of August 19th, freight rates were 87% below cost, and the increase in fuel prices on October 1st made the gap even wider, increasing to 114%. In terms of the difference in fuel prices alone, the shipping companies in Shanghai must lose more than six million gold yuan per month, but freight rates have not been adjusted to date. (2) The fuel quota has always been insufficient for actual needs, but the fuel price has been adjusted and the quota has been sharply reduced. The October allocation is only 37.5% of the original quota, which is even more insufficient. (3) Food rice and cooking oil are scarce in Shanghai and cannot be purchased. It is difficult for the ships to supply food to the crew and passengers. This panic phenomenon is increasing. Repeated appeals have been made to the government to make reasonable adjustments to freight rates, or to cancel the increase in fuel prices, or to subsidize the difference in fuel prices, and to fully supply fuel oil and food rice and cooking oil for ships, but none of these have been done. The shipping industry is trying to maintain transportation and sacrificing itself with pain, but it is now exhausted and cannot maintain it. Therefore, it was decided to send representatives to Nanjing to appeal to the government to quickly resolve the above problems. Under the current difficult situation, in addition to making efforts to operate on the main routes, the shipping companies will consider reducing the number of voyages. If the ships are unable to purchase food, the passengers will have to bring their own dry food, and the ships will not provide meals.</p>

Finally, Lu Qizhong, Cheng Linsheng, Xu Rongsheng, and the other 12 people were prosecuted for violating the National General Mobilization Law and the Regulations for Punishing Corruption.

Except for Luo Fuzhang and Chen Jinchu, who did not appear in court, all the other defendants appeared in court to answer questions. The testimonies of Xu Rongsheng and the other seven people were almost identical, all claiming that the broken rice distributed to the rice stores they opened by the Civil Mediation Committee was not purchased by anyone, so they sold their own good rice, and the remaining broken rice belonged to them and could be used to offset the liquor payment. The court stated that the testimonies of the defendants still need to be investigated by the Yangjing Sub-bureau and the Civil Mediation Committee, and ordered a change of date for another trial. The defendants were released on their original bail.</p>

<h3>Although Market Interest Rates are High, Credit Shows Slight Easing</h3>
<p>〔Commodity Investigation News〕The tight credit situation continued yesterday. The turnover in the market seemed to be slightly easier than before.

Market interest rates are still between 6 and 7 yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of more than 1.8%. The phenomenon of a shortage of orders in silver and money houses is still common. It is reported that the main reasons for this credit crunch are (1) the reduction in the source of funds, (2) the public's rush to withdraw cash, and (3) the outflow of hot money.</p>

<h3>Silk is Stable</h3>
<p>People's silk stabilized after the China Trust Bureau explained yesterday that the silk weaving industry on this street would continue to be distributed as usual.

Silk shops have slightly sold some retail goods, and the trend is stable. There is still no supply of raw silk on the market, and no transactions have been heard.</p>
<p>The second phase of silk distribution is about to begin. The factory still has to return the finished product to the raw materials it receives, so there is not much stock left. Recently, raw materials are priced but there is no goods, and the output has been greatly reduced, so there is no spot supply in the market. Most of the stocks held by wholesalers are waiting and not selling, and transactions in the market are deserted. Because door-to-door merchants on this street cannot purchase after coming, retail sales are also limited, and popular goods are not displayed. Cold goods or colors that do not match the season are still available.</p>
