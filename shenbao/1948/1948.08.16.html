<p>〔中央社康　狄格州格林咸治城十四日電〕甫自中國訪問歸來之　者名遠東貿易商，上海衛利韓公司董事長亨特，今在其此間寓所談稱：此行一般印象，即到達中國之美援，必須迅速作最有利之應用，亨氏係以美國對外貿易委員會遠東小組委員會主席之資格赴東方，作商業考察者。渠稱；準備以其考察在華貿易之報告，提交美對外貿易委員會，俾供下月舉行之理事會討論，將來該委員會可能對未來中美經濟關係提出之任何建議，自將影響美對華政策，此因對外貿易委員會爲美國最有力之經濟組織也。就亨氏所見，目前中國問題之關鍵，不在中國政府何日始能實行改革，而在美軍事及紹濟援助如何能作迅速有效之運用。渠認爲軍事援助更屬主要，謂如軍事情勢能改善，則中國之經濟社會問題，亦能逐漸納入正軌。渠個人相信，由中國共產主義威脅之嚴重性，美國政府將加速援華計劃之實現。亨氏認爲，中國如在軍事情勢確獲改善前，逕行改革幣制，實有不切實際之處，與其發行新通貨，而依然不得人民之信任支持，不如聽任法幣在此一時期中，繼續貶値爲佳，倘無足够準備金，而發行新幣，不啻爲經濟自殺也。</p>

<p>〔本報南京寸五日電〕某權威人士十五日語記者，最近物價又突起劇烈漲潮，對於民生及社會之影響實甚爲嚴重，最近一二月內爲我國經濟最困難時期，此時美援物資尙未能有效　揮運用，且有甚多美援物資尙未　到，故經濟之困難，可謂已達於　點。惟過此以後，美援物資源源而來，經濟之困難，即可較前改善。該權威人士分析最近漲潮原因有四：（一）爲游資之作祟，行莊金融機構浮濫，致游資在市塲活動，刺激物價之上漲。（二）國家銀行亦未能善盡責任。（三）黃金·美鈔經常領導物價上漲，黃金·美鈔成爲游資投機之目標，以六月份爲例，美鈔之黑市價，較結匯證明書高出一倍，足見購美鈔者多爲投機，而非縱事推進國際貿易·（四）經濟方案傳說甚久，尚未着中公布實行，投機者曾因新經濟方案之傳說而稍歛跡，現見新方案尙未公布，乃復又趨活躍。該權威人士認爲，如政府實行新金融政策，控制游資，加强管制金融，則物價即可望趨於平穩，以渡過目前經濟之難關。</p>

<p>〔本報新鄉十四日電〕因國軍在豫北廣泛之掃蕩，匪軍政治機構及民心已大爲損失及搖動，匪爲挽回頹勢，不惜犧牲，發動萬餘人蠢動，將爲國軍捕捉匪軍主力之一機會，國軍將藉以澄淸豫北局勢。又據軍息：十三日晚三時，匪千餘携砲兩門，進犯淇門（新鄉東北方），經國軍還擊後逃竄。又盤據安陽附近之陳匪十四縱隊四十一·四十二兩旅主力，近經菜園·五陵·濬縣，向國軍控制區蠢動，其主力十三日已竄抵沙店·柳衛·李源屯·一帶，似有進犯汲縣之企圖。又匪張公幹部卅六師，以三團兵力，並配合土共，亦在延長之三角地帶蠢動，其目的似在牽制國軍，響應陳匪十四縱隊。又沿新延公路向東挺進之國軍，十三日進達延州村，十四日將會合另一路北援國軍，迂迴進入戰塲，將在新（鄉）　（縣）延（津）三角地區內展開殲滅戰。</p>
<p>〔本報新鄉十五日電〕軍息：豫北前綫竟日沉寂，匪十四縱隊主力在李源屯搶掠一部食糧後，現均集結淇門。匪卅六師三五六，三五七·兩團，十四日已退往宦邱牛悌屯一帶，國軍勁旅十四一日已達延津。據目前觀測，匪主要企圖係在打擊地方團隊，決無任何力量攻擊國軍主要據點，汲縣威脅已解除。又，盤據豫北之匪十四縱隊及卅六師，現已合併番號爲三·八兩縱隊，最近有渡河南竄之態勢，以補充傷亡迨盡之陳匪三。八兩縱隊，故此次豫北匪之蠢動，判明純係滋擾。</p>

<h3 id="c23">東亞的新氣象 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>大韓共和國關國典應，昨已在漢城隆重舉行，盟總麥帥與我國駐韓大使劉馭萬均曾參加。美國政府同時發表聲朋暫行承認韓國政府，並任命馬卡諾爲特別代表。英國和加拿大也將步中美之後塵承認大韓政府。韓國新政府的成立，不僅是韓人復國統一運動的里程碑，而且也是東亞民族主義蓬勃興起的新階段，實具有非常重大的意義。尤其是韓國新政府選定昨日爲開國紀念日，使八月十五日的一天，更加成爲東亞歷史上，最偉大最值得紀念之一日。在三年之前，日本接受波茨坦宣言，正式宣佈無條件投降，結東了這一次空前悲慘的大戰，燃起了人類對於和平繁榮的希望。尤其是東亞各被壓迫的民族，受了侵略者失敗的鼓勵，無不挺身而出，追求自由，要求解放，二年之後，就有印度首先獲得解放，印度和巴基斯坦成爲東亞的一對孿生國，到昨天正是她倆的周歲紀念日，而在亞洲的東北角，又有大韓政府的成立，雙喜臨門，更值得亞洲人民的歡欣慶幸。</p>
<p>從地理上觀察，韓國適居於中·日·蘇三國之間，可以說是臼本列島興亞洲大陸的橋樑，也可以說是中蘇兩國間的橋樑，確實是東亞和平安全的一大基點。但在最近五十年來，韓國却遭日本的侵略迫害，以致於亡國，直到三年前的八月十五日，臼本無條件投降，韓國纔從日本帝國主義的魔掌中解放出來。前在大戰期間，各大盟國雖先後發表開羅會議宣言和波茨坦宣言，保證韓國的自由獨立：但到了勝利之後，韓國不僅未能立刻實現其復國統一的願望，而且其國運反爲强權政治所貽誤。一九四五年十二月莫斯科三國外長會議，竟決定韓國先由中·美·英·蘇四强共同託管五年，然後許其獨立，因此韓國的南北兩區，乃爲美蘇兩國所佔領；又因美蘇思想的不同和利害的衝突，更加深了韓國的分裂，造成南北割裂的局面。</p>
<p>但是韓國的分裂，不僅是韓國人民的悲劇，而且也是東亞的不幸。聯合國有鑒於此，乃決定在韓國南部美軍佔領區內，先單獨舉行普選，召開國民會議，制定民主憲法，選舉總統副總統，然後再依照憲法之規定，組織韓國獨立的民主新政府，卒於昨臼正式成立。中韓兩國情同手足，關係密切，有如唇齒，過去中國不僅同情韓國的獨立運動，抑且無往而不予以有力的支援；開羅會議時我國蔣總統之爲韓國爭獨立爭解放，固已爲舉世所周知，而現在大韓政府成立，中國更首先在事實上予以承認，使它立卽獲得國際上的地位，美國自然不甘後人，也卽予以承認。韓國新政府的地位既經穩固，自可以南韓爲統一全國的起點；我們行見韓國逐漸統一而復其光榮，不勝爲東亞的前途慶幸。</p>
<p>正當我們熱烈慶祝韓國政府成立的時候，又欣逢新印度的周歲。中國和印度是亞洲兩個最大的國家，不僅歷史悠久，文明最古，人口眾多，物資豐富；而且在中印兩國之間，幾千年來，文化的交流，沒有利害的衝突。勝利以還，中印兩國代表在聯合國任何會議席上，意見更總是一致的。但是中印文化的交流，兩國關係的聯繫，在今天看來，仍不能不認爲尙嫌不足，我們還得要加倍努力，尤其雙方國民之問更當加倍努力，促進兩國邦交，互相携手合作，共謀東亞和平的百年大計。印度駐華大使潘尼迦，也有同樣的威覺，他在致中國人民書中，除了表示珍視中國的友誼而外，並堅決主張，中印並肩合作，確保亞洲和平。這一番話，我們信其決非外交辭令，的確，中印兩大國的通力合作，可以使八萬萬人口站在一起，實爲亞洲和平最有力的保障。</p>
<p>要之，戰前的亞洲是西方列强的殖民地，而今我們眼看到亞洲民族主義蓬勃與起的景象，新印度方慶賀其週歲，大韓國也已呱呱墮地，亞洲的前途充滿了光明，使我們更加相信，只要忝爲「老大」的中華民國能够奮發圖强，以日新又新的精神，聯合亞洲新生獨立民主的各國，共謀亞洲的和平與繁榮，則東亞光明的遠景不難有完全實現的一天。</p>

<p>民初以來，國人就開始重視農運，在許多先進專家中間，手創平民教育促進會，在定縣從事鄉村工作的晏陽初先生，無疑的是一位成就最大，國際聲譽最高的人；他現在擔任農村復興委會委員聯合委會的執行長。記者頃得機與晏氏作一夕長談，特書其梗概，以饗讀者：</p>
<p>力的教育　晏先生是一位祟尙實際的學者，他認爲中國的富源在於中國民眾，中國的偉大的潛伏力量要從人民中間去發掘。他說，環顧今日的世界，一切無不受力量强弱的左右，「有力者主，無力者奴！」有力量的支配他人，沒有力量的祇得受人支配，祗有人民發揮出自己的力量來，才能作民主國家的主人翁，國家也才能因此談得上富强。力量是什麼？知識是力量，生產是力量，建康是力量，組織是力量。晏先生特別指出，爲了發掘蘊藏在萬萬以上農民中間的無限力量，爲了針對解救中國農民的「愚貧弱私」四種毛病，貧弱兩個字意義很淸楚，無煩解說；愚不是天生的，是沒有受教育的機會，不能表現其才智；私也不是天生的，是由於缺乏羣體發揮力量的組織。從民國十二年以來，晏先生與他的同志就倡導在農村推行「文慶教育，生計教育，衛生教育與公民教育」。爲了求名詞的普遍易解，晏先生並且把建設農村所利賴的四稱教育，易稱爲農村的文藝·生產·健康和組織四種教育，相互配合，目的都在藉以發掘農民的潛伏的偉大力量。簡言之，四種教育在一起形成了一部完整的「力的教育」。</p>
<p>培養知識力量的文藝教育；文藝教育包括文字教育與藝術教育兩方面，前者着重於教老百姓識字取得基本的教育，平教曾爲推行識字運動，曾從事貧民教育所需要的課本及輔助讀物的研究和編輯工作，從日常通用的字彙中選擇若干單字和名詞，用以施教。對於藝術教育，平教會亦曾多年從事研究著述，製造藝術教育的工具和表演及表證工作，藉戲劇·鼓詞·電影·圖畫·以及無綫電農播，音樂演奏·來提高農民藝術生活，並灑輪各項常識</p>
<p>增加農村財富的生產教育；生產教育的內容，大約包括四個方面，一爲農業，如作物改良，園藝收畜的改良，害蟲的防制，肥料的應用等；二爲經濟，如生產遝銷的合作社之組織，與信用貸款以及農業生產的方式與農村經濟的制度；三爲農村工藝，如棉毛紡織，絲茶生產，農具和一切加工製造的工藝等，四爲農業工程，如農具改良，機械化的應用，興修農田水利等。晏先生特別强調農民生產本身的增加，不足以改善農民的生活，除非農民自覺自悟，起而管理自己的事？如農產經營和信用·販賣運銷的合作組合，方可免中間階層的剝削，農民方可直接獲得利益，逐漸改革整個的農村經濟方式。談到農業機械化問題，晏先生說：「農產增加，農民的合作與經營技術改善了，農民有了教育，有了組識等條件，農業械化才更有力量。」</p>
<p>促進農民堅强體魄的健康教育：爲了促進農民衛生與醫療疾病，平教會曾有一個非常的貢獻，就是農村新醫藥制度的創設，他們在定縣成立保健院和所屬的保健所，並在村鎭設置若干保健員，担負農民醫療保健的任務，是爲戰前及目前所行衛生院制度的濫觴。晏先生認爲在中國財力貧乏，醫藥人才短絀的今日，在農村裏預防疾病，更勝於醫療，若干種傳染病，例如天花，霍亂等，都可於事先予以預防，與普遍推行疾病預防工作，並進的爲注重農民之營養。晏先生以爲農產品中，具有豐富營養價值者，如黃豆·番茄等，可勸令人民多予種植，藉以增加他們日常的營養。又健康教育的完成，一方在于灑輸人民以衛生知識，一方在于培植人民以衛生的習慣，二者都待農村運動工作的循循善誘。晏氏說：一難鄉先要建民」，健康教育之最終目的，乃在于提高人民的「活力」之後，農村方纔具有了一切建設的基本條件。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c59">史達林的繼承人　這還是一個最大的秘密 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 作者密特爾敦</p>
<p>今昔情異勢殊</p>
<p>日丹諾夫在黨內的勢力如此，使蘇聯國內若干政治人物一回憶史達林獲得政權的舊事，便覺得他是第一個最得寵的繼承人了。但是，自史達林繼承列寗及消滅托洛斯基後，情勢已改變了。昔日，共產黨是這年靑的國度中唯一有力的集團。今天，這一集團的力量雖仍强大，却已有保安機構和包括官僚與軍隊的政府集團相抗衡了。</p>
<p>舉一個例，貝利亞可以二十師國家秘密軍隊和若干便衣特務炫耀他人，但是問題部在於到底這些人，忠於其組織戡其領袖抑忠於黨呢？</p>
<p>布爾加寗元帥可以軍隊來炫耀第二次世界大戰的功績，這些軍隊是嫉忌共黨和保安機構的，然而後兩者自二次戰事以來即已合併，以限制戰時的將領的權力，和削弱他們在政府中的勢力。</p>
<p>最近，政府派的力量大見增長。不僅包括諸如外交部，他業部的一般部會，也滲與其他主要工業部門。因此，其勢力除行政人員外，也及於技術人員，工程師和必要時可得到經濟計劃的專家們了。好像國家計劃的重要性，較軍隊黨和保安機構更且重要性。所有三個集團，軍隊，政府和保安都這樣擴張，使形成雖謂黨培養其生長，然已不爲黨所控制的形勢了。</p>
<p>幸運時時變化</p>
<p>目前，各方對現時史達林所掌握的領導地位的爭取，維持一種不安的平衡。在這帝國的克林姆宮的氣氛中，優勢的競賽此起彼落。同時，史達林則維持得高高在上。</p>
<p>今日雖謂史達林在莫斯科的工作，一如往昔的長時間和艱苦，但據說在政治局的辯爭中，他已少參加了。他祗是靜聽各人發言，最後，以極少的話語作結論。</p>
<p>他似較莫洛托夫吏有人性，更可親近。這一點使西方人士相信，個如能和史達林直接談判，一切或更有進展。</p>
<p>在往日是沒有人有這樣的權力。當蘇聯受壓迫，史達林能作必要的讓步，在蘇聯祗有他個人能這樣做而不受批評。但是當獻身於共產主義的教條時，他卻像莫洛托夫一樣的冷酷，和堅定。</p>
<p>在蘇聯，史達林是半神化的人物。他是詩歌和故事中的英雄，對他誇張的頌讃，會使波斯的專制帝皇也爲之報顏。他的肖像縣於蒙古騎兵的帳幕內，列寗格勒平民住宅的墻壁，和烏克蘭農民的農舍中。</p>
<p>詩歌的「讚頌」</p>
<p>掛像隨境而異。在種族複雜的蘇聯中，每一民族各以自己的偶像看史達林，因此當卡薩赫人在人像展覽會中掛起巨大的畫像時，很易看出領袖的特質渲染了許多卡蕯赫性。中亞細亞諸共和國的旗幟寫着：「加方面各部落的讚歌中有史達林的名字。在最高蘇維埃前面一代表的演亂中總會包括史達林這一名字的神秘音節。</p>
<p>無數的蘇聯人民認爲史達林是最總明而萬能的；他是勝利的創造者，製造新俄羅斯的工程師，教義的制作人和解釋人，全蘇聯人的父親。他的死，不僅留下權力的空隙，也留下一個偶像崇拜的空隙。</p>
<p>繼承的主要問題，在乎爭取繼承權的問題能否由國會暗中決定。假如可以這樣做，表面的團結仍可維持，否則團結將告破裂。史達林可能在兩天中把繼承的問題解決，他可以指定一人爲其繼承人，繼續目前掌握的最重要職位。否則，他便把政府的大權落到莫洛托夫·日丹諾夫，貝利亞和布爾加寗的四角競爭了。</p>
<p>衝突是必然的</p>
<p>看一看這賭註中的政權，爭奪這一政權的鬥爭似乎無法避免。但是，這種鬥爭也不一定要等到史達林逝世可能在這一部長集團中便爆發了。這種三十年來灑輸到所有黨員的鬥爭，可能應用到克林姆宮中了。</p>
<p>假如沒有這種鬥爭發生，新的形勢必危害蘇聯未來的經濟及其在世界上的地位。在蘇聯，沒有一個機構能改變蘇聯政府或同時滿足二三敵對的集團。再惡化的話，爭奪政權擴大下去便演成內戰，終於使國家經濟和社會生活脫離正軌。</p>
<p>在全蘇進行鬥爭的形勢中，控制保安機構的同利亞最有職利的希望。如由國會決定時，那麼莫洛托夫和日州諾夫便是最顯著的候補人。（下）</p>

<p>當時並未予以扣留</p>
<p>〔合眾社莫斯科十五日電〕蘇聯報紙十五日對美國偵查共產間諜之發展一字不提，而載稱，數月前，美國駐蘇軍事參贊，從事破壤工作時，被當塲捕獲而逐出國境。據報載美參贊特雷吼中尉，自某蘇聯關稅官員處獲得「秘密」情報，然「兩人於四月二十三日被高級關員及保安官員所破獲，兩人面有駭色。當經審訊，並查獲英俄文之筆託及文件。其時兩人中不明身份之一人，即突襲保安軍官，圖奪取文件，不果。筆記文件中均有極端秘密之情報，不明身份者即係特雷吼。」特氏直認自關員處取得情報不諱，關員亦證實其說。蘇方乃要求美大使館立即將特氏逐回本國，美使館迅速照辦，對罪行竟無一言聲辦。美使館十五日承認特氏曾在此間供職。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市梅林罐頭食品廠昨招待新聞記者前往虹橋路該廠參觀。</p>
<p>罐頭食品在戰前戰後，因美軍軍用各種罐頭口糧之大量輸入，而予人以深刻之印象，惟罐頭食品製造事業在我國猶爲鳳毛麟角，戰前有泰豐公司，但其事業巳失敗而不復聞矣。今日我國罐頭食品製造廠，稍具規模者，僅梅林一家而巳。</p>
<p>罐頭食品製造廠猶如一社會之大廚房，各種食物經其加工後，一方面便利食客不必經烹飪而享用，一方面延長時令性食物之壽命，擴大地域性食物之嘗味範圍。其製造經過並無特別可述之處。梅林所製有肉食·魚類·水集·蔬菜等等，此類食物在不銹鋼大鍋中調味煮沸後，即封入罐內，封罐時罐蓋用一圈橡皮筋在高壓機所產生之高熟下熔黏而與罐口附着，再投入蒸氣機中加熱，使罐內空氣膨脹，經橡皮微孔逸出，然後取出冷縮，即可久藏。</p>
<p>梅林創辦於民國二十二年一月間在虹橋路購地數十畝，自建廠房，並向國外購置蒸氣機·揀選機·製罐機等，規模粗具，惜受戰爭及戰後一般局勢之影饗，近年以來，發展甚爲困難。該廠現有工人百餘名，除罐頭食品之外，尙有番茄沙司·辣醬油·汽水等出品。</p>
<p>值得一提者，該廠出品於民國二十八年起開始遠銷南洋美洲。抗戰時期租界淪陷，英美外人集巾營所需食品均由該公司供給。戰後國外市塲恢復，該公司出品大量外銷，所製馬蹄（即學薺）·靑豆·枇杷等在美洲甚受歡迎。三十七年份內爭取之外匯達美金七萬餘元。該廠爲製造蕃茄醬及靑荳罐，特自美國購來種十，發給妅橋一帶農民種植，然後由該廠收購，既可提倡國產，復能施惠農村，除妅橋路總廠外，塘樓及崇明均有分廠，前者專製枇杷·櫻桃·油燜荀，後者裝製鳳尾魚·玉稚魚。最近並擬在合灣設立分廠，專製當地特產水菜鳳梨運銷美洲。三十五年間該廠曾派工程師赴美研究製罐技術，不久即可學成返國。今後努力改進，或可爲我國罐頭食品製造事業放一異彩。</p>

<p>上海監貸銀團奉令停辦後，運商資金失調，間接影響食鹽價格。目前浙滬監斤每祖已售達九百餘萬元，徐埠一帶甚至高達一千五百餘萬元，若不設怯改善，影響民生至鉅。有人認爲監斤價格上揚，係一般物價波動之自然趨勢，尤以遝輪費用激增，蔴袋成本提高所致。據接近運商方面人士評述，實際因素，并不盡然。按監價上漲，與銀團停辦，實有重大關鍵。追溯兩年來中國銀行領導監貸銀團工作，推行尙稱順利，其方式如採用押權，憑物貸放，依承運數量多寡，而定其貸額若干，貸戶利益均等，并無新舊大小區別。停辦後，資金充裕之運商，固可照舊經營，且可運用其他手腕，獲取他種貸款，小者則捉襟見肘，難免淘汰。結果造成：（一）銷區監斤缺乏，價格上漲，軍需民食，兩受威脅。（二）產區擱滯，資金不能週轉，影響再生產，灶民生活堪處，稅源减色。（三）設產地隣近匪區，物資安全保障可慮。政府爲鼓勵監斤生產，今春由四聯總處，於國策貸款下，核准監斤生產貸款總額一萬三千億元，由國行承做轉質押，并將以前集中於上海舉辦者，以銀團取銷關係，移轉至浙·閩·靑島等地，指定中國銀行爲滬·浙·閩區之代表行，交通銀行爲靑島區代表行惟目前成本又有增加，貸額未見調整，距離實際已一遠。至於運銷貸款，自上月份銀一團結束後，由各行局視同業務貸款，酌量辦理，以轉質押手續，尙未商妥，迄今貸放數字不多。又悉：本月九日國行貼放委員曾通過關於鹽務總局配運湘·鄂·贛·皖·豫五岸，及徐埠淮鹽運銷轉押匯，交由該行業務局與各行局商定款額興辦法，一般運商以值此運銷吒季，資金缺乏，均希望此項辦法，迅予實施。</p>

<h3 id="c99">漲風中的杭州天堂 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 本報杭州十四日訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>多大過去了，杭州物價的漲風，隨着「秋老虎」的熱浪以俱來。麵·蔬菜·豬肉·鷄蛋一致向上躍升，在兩日之中，竟漲過了百分之八十，升斗小民，正不知何以爲計？一些貧窮的公務人員，他們在發薪的時候，趕急去買一些袁頭大銀洋，待要用錢時，再把銀洋掉換鈔票，因爲任何儲　，都敵不過物價的在跳。鈔票，一天是一天的價值，在盡量地貶低。因此，杭州市銀樓最多的淸泰路，尤其那淸泰路藘橋附近大銀樓旁邊的堂子巷與珠寶巷口，終日不息的「可可噹噹」敲銀洋的聲音，羹成一片威脅人們神經的聲良，如果你走近他們，他們會問你要「大頭」或「小頭」？金子要不要？在杭州每家的日報上，有金子的市價外，還有黑金的價錢，有銀洋的價錢，而這裏所謂黑金，到要比店家的金價便宜一成左右。</p>
<p>杭州和上海的金融市塲比起來，自然不能同日而語，上海已經在講美鈔，而杭州却還在談銀洋與金子。可是上海的每個做金鈔巨頭都是在想怯如何把財富集中於一身，而杭州大多數的人，是在沒有辦法之下，才去買賣銀洋的。杭州，當然也有很多有錢的人，他們當然也做金鈔生意，囤積貨物，甚至乘低價時，不情以公家的名義買進人民必需的糧食，在米糧高價時，又說什麼榖賤傷農，要求高價出售，譬如現在這個物價荒亂的時代，早稻已經收榖登塲了，我們在出糧的縣份有見一大批一大批的米糧外運，但是米價非但沒有跌，還是高得嚇死人。雖然法幣貶值，其他物價騰昇，米，到底還是百物之主，它這樣的身價百倍，其他百物吏其瘋狂了。最可憐的還是農村中的農胞，他們終年辛苦勞碌，收穫的多半爲捐募，攤派，租稅所分配了，只拿到的是每天在跌價的法幣。</p>
<p>今年夏天，杭州市雨水很稀少，入秋後，還是一般的乾旱，我們不由得不想起胼手胝足的這一羣善良的農胞來，他們不分晝夜，轍水灑田，那怕手和脚都起了泡，人曬出了「醬油」，還是那樣不停的工作着，我們今天享受的人，尤其是官塲裏的人，到底爲他們做了多少工作？解決了多少苦難？他們戽水的工具，還是百餘年前的舊套，他們耘田的方怯，也都是陳舊了的老方法，享受的人們忘記了他們，政府難道也忘記了他們嗎？</p>
<p>秋收快要到了，我們幾曾想到令年的秋收如何？如何來安慰農胞們的辛勞？在城市中的人，近來都在「錢」裏翻觔斗，根本想不到這些了。</p>
<p>在物價高壓之下，農胞看到自己勞苦的收穫，不能維持自己的溫飽，他們或將大量逃離農村，而去幹其他的行當，如果這樣，如果長此以往，那就要不堪設想了。</p>
<p>在杭州，一度被懸爲禁例的私娼，近來更活躍於英士街頭，在從前，是一些中年的婦人，她們似乎是精熟於此道，在現在，一些年靑的姑娘，像是剛從鄉下來的，她們羞澀的在拉攏客人。</p>
<p>失業的人也在逐漸的加多，來來往往盡是謀事的人，有的謀事不獲，竟萌短見，有的謀事未得，在菜飯館中白吃了一番，討飯的人也逐漸的加多，每家人家幾都戶限爲穿，杭州的報紙上，經常載得有自殺與殺人的新聞，這些自殺新聞中，大多是失業與淫亂。</p>
<p>當然，以上這許多情形，大部份的責任是歸在物價狂漲與法幣貶值上，政府處理這一件事的對策，似乎只有在銀根抽緊上用功夫，銀根抽緊以後，行莊自然感覺頭寸不能軋齊之苦，於是各家行莊發行一種本票，據說這種本票也可以買貨物，也可以存銀行，那麼政府的所謂抽緊銀根，仍舊等於無用，近來杭州市上本票到處飛舞，物價依然不斷的上漲。</p>
<p>杭州雖然有西湖之勝，但萬千市民都爲着物價而驚悸住了，他們已無心再來欣賞這大好的湖山，所以划子的夏夜生意並不見得好，夜花園每家都賠了本，一些可以納凉的名勝區，客人也不見得多。</p>
<p>杭州在夏秋之交的時候，僅成了避暑人們的過道，去墓千山的人必須經過杭州，去牯嶺的人，因爲近來沒有飛機，所以也得經過杭州，坐着浙贛將車去南昌，九江而達盧山脚下。</p>
<p>杭州人士唯一的希望，就是炎熱的夏天迅速過去，比夏天差不多一樣炎熟的秋老虎也迅速的過去，接着來一個秋高氣爽的天氣，九溪十八澗，玉皇山上的紅葉開透了，滿覺隴的桂花香遍了，滿湖的樹木綠深了，那時京滬來的遊客又要多起來了，杭州的商店又可以賺一筆錢。杭州的商店是如此想，杭州的僧道們也如此想，小販，黃包車夫，三輪車夫，汽車行，無不如此想，但在杭州市上犬多數靠着薪水生活的人，有沒有這樣的閒情作如此的想怯呢？</p>
<h3 id="c100">國防前綫　馬鬃山 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州五日航訊〕馬鬃山是天山餘脈，海拔約兩千至三千尺，位於安西縣北，是甘肅的極北部，和外蒙及新疆·寗夏接壞，成一三角地帶，它的面積約九萬一千餘平方公里。中古時期，這裏是人類鬥爭最繳烈的地方，西戎·月氐·匈奴·漢·西夏·蒙古等族人，都在這裏流過血，淸乾隆時劃入安西府，民國以來隸安西縣，現在明設肅北設治局管轄。</p>
<p>由於它的地勢險要，外蒙一獨立」後它更成了西北國防最前綫，所以我們一到酒泉，便和七區行政專員王維墉先生談起它。據王專員說，馬鬃山馬於肅北設治局，居民都是蒙族，總共不到一千人，但都不在他們的土地上，部寄居在安西敦煌之間的西湖，布隆吉兩地。他們大致分爲靑海和新娠兩部落，靑海一部份由公保舉率領，新疆一部份由國大代表色布拉率領，設治局也暫設在安西的三道溝鎭，離它的人民有四百里，現任局長是曹奎文。因此，我們對這土地·人民·政權完全脫節的肅北設治局，大感興趣，一路上逢人便探詢馬鬃山的情况，現由駐該地的張營長琢之，一九一旅廖旅長鳳運，廿三師黃師長祖壎，鄭參謀長壯懷及各縣縣長的談話裏，已得知梗概。張營長在安西時還勸我們進山去看一下，但因爲交通的不便和時間的短促，我們却拂了他的盛情。馬鬃山是個荒涼的地區，只有一去島里雅蘇合經商的人在山裏設有蒙古包。光緒廿七年時，外蒙和新疆的少數蒙民，才遊牧到這裏。民國七年甘省禁烟頗嚴，內地土棍三百餘人潛入馬鬃山伊克高魯地方，倫種雅片。由於這裏是法外天地，居民便一天天多起來。</p>
<p>蒙哈族積仇日深</p>
<p>民國八年，有名爲白駝喇嘛的外蒙靑年入馬鬃山，在公婆泉南小山裘修建石頭城，構築作戰工事，想和外蒙的首領哲布尊丹巴呼岡克圖一爭短長。到十一年，漢人逐漸遷徙他處，這時的公婆泉已有三四萬頭牲畜，三百幕蒙民，而且都受着軍事訓練。我政府爲了息事寗人，雖不加聞問，但外蒙却以爲是心腹之患，所以十二年八月間，庫倫派來刺客，把白駝喇嘛刺死了。越三月，又派來五百餘騎蒙兵，把公婆泉夷爲平地，蒙民一齊被殺死或被俘。</p>
<p>十三年以後，濛民又漸漸逃回。十七年，從新疆鎭西竄來的哈薩克人入山，到處掠殺，政府即委蒙民的領袖包布拉組自衛隊淸剿，哈民便又他竄。這時由寗夏，新疆，外蒙逃來的蒙民，又有六百多幕，從外蒙逃來的蒙民，爲了憎恨外蒙的新政權，不時到外蒙去示威。最後外蒙政府派兵三百名在廿一年秋突來馬鬃山，屠殺蒙民四百餘人。哈民又乘隙來製，殘餘的蒙民，乃紛紛遷徙祁連山魚兒紅一帶，其餘十幾幕蒙民，後來也避牧於安西，敦煌一帶。</p>
<p>廿三年新綏公司的汽車通過此地後，安西委派團總張不麟招撫流亡，在山中設稅卡征收駝捐，草頭稅，蒙民又漸次歸來。到廿四年冬天又有一百多幕了。接着，新疆阿山，鎭西等地的哈蕯克人，因不堪新疆政府的壓迫，先後逃來馬鬃山的，截至廿八年底，有兩千五百多幕，一萬二千多人。這些哈民移入馬鬃山，本來是逃避新疆政府的拘捕，但是後來竟搶掠起來，價地的蒙民不得不再逃他處。這時抗戰正殷，政府一再設怯撫緝哈民，自卅二年起，限哈民移入祁運山，並把這一帶的蒙民，一齊合併到馬鬃山去，以甘新公路爲界，不許彼此侵犯。但如此廣關荒凉的地區，既不能時時預防，而蒙·哈兩族間積仇日深，常常互相報復，如今馬鬃山內，除了駐軍以外，幾乎人烟斷絕了。</p>
<p>三據點　國軍駐守</p>
<p>馬鬃山的眞面目如何，我們無機會去觀光，只是聽人說：北部均係戈　流沙，南部則水草與沙礦相間，分部的牧畜，耕種，還不是絕不可能，藥村，礦藏也極豐富。目前馬鬃山內，公婆泉，明水，馬蓮井三個據點上，都有我軍駐守，不慮竄擾。不過由於運輸的不便，駐山的士兵每月吃不到兩次靑菜，缺乏維他命，所以時有色盲，腿腫等病發生，託者深感在補給方面，應立即加以改善，同時聯絡方面，還更加强。</p>
<p>近人有詠馬鬃山詩，讀之可以想像到它的地勢，詩云：「平沙望山如眼前，騎駝踏雪又一天，馬鬃山峯長如蛇，千邱萬陵相鈞連，我道此山虎背險，人間竟以馬鬃傳，砂黃石黑疑無路，豁然開朗一孔穿。……壁立兩山夾大道，山外有山如屏風，四面絕峯天一綫，太古穴居何鴻濛。。……夜深支帳山南口，曉茶烟濃看日紅。……</p>

<p>〔本報杭州十四日訊〕杭市浙江行政學會同人，鑒於國內一般人對國事憂懼日深，或側重於軍事，或關心於經濟，而對於政治工作仍不免有所忽視，爰經該會五屆會員　會詳加檢討，草成一文，發出了嚴正的呼聲，以冀有識之士能多多的重視政治的工作，從平凡的現實中力求進步，力求革新。茲摘錄全文要點若干項，藉供各界參考。</p>
<p>第一，我們現在正在戡亂，當然不可以再製造亂。我們現在已經行憲，當然不可以隨便的違憲。要知道違憲便是製造亂源，而要撲滅新生的亂源，更須遵守憲怯，凡是好亂的人都反對法，尤其是憲法，因爲怯治與動亂一向是不並存的。因此，我們不贊成一切推翻，修改，變更，動搖，違背憲怯的言論或是行動。、第二，國家的動亂，己經到了極點。要挽救這個局勢，只有從速實行憲法上所規定的地方制度。換言之，過去的中央過分集權，巳經使得地方一無可爲，　論縣爲自治單位？王鳳崗畢廷芳，在華北的奇蹟，便是他們能因地制宜，不必一、定要受太瑣細的中央法令的拘東。憲怯上的中央省縣三級均權制是本　國父遣教經過再三研究而規定的，應該趕快實行。尤其省縣自洽通則草案及早制定，並且要注意顧名思義，應當只是通則，不必太瑣細，反使日後的省縣自治法沒有內容。今天要建立國家必須先建立地方。決沒有四肢疲軟的人而能支持一個充血的大頭腦的。</p>
<p>第三，現在的人民窮困到了極點，每個人生活費用數字都增大了，而生活水準都降低了。就在這低無可低的生活中，還有着多少的担負。現行的田糧，稅捐，徵兵的制度，可以改革的地方實在太多。平心而論，人民並不是不願意對國家的負担，但是對國家無益而對人民有損的無辜損失，總應該設法避免。</p>
<p>第四，說到行政本身，無非是栽撤駢枝機關，提高公教人員的待遇，實行文官制度，增進行政效率這幾點，這些話大家也說得多了，實在也不必多說。我們的意思關於用人方面，憲怯第八十五條規定「非經考試及格者，不得任用。」至於機關方面，十多年來，不知有過多少興廢，我們只希求國家能多設建設性的機構，以容納眞正想做事的人，使其可以做事。機關减少，事權集中，效率自然可以提高。機關减少，開支節省，待遇也自然可以提高。機關减少，用人不多，濫竽的人自然不能倖進。機關减少，責櫂分明，人民也自然不再遭受無辜的損害。同時，裁併機關，必須立即多辦建般性事業，以消納人才，增進社會的財富。</p>

<p>這時候，匪軍對濟南展開了神經攻勢。一面調兵遣將，故擺疑陣，將留在山東的主力七個縱隊，（即陳毅部第六，七，九，十，十三，新八，及渤海縱隊）。掃數調集濟南外圍泰安，肥城，范家鎭，水北街，龍山，章邱一帶，一面復廣徵民伕，大造雲梯，作攻城準備。同時新華社也一再揚言攻取濟南。使濟市的人心，激盪起來。本（八）月九日，這種因而不安的心情，可謂已到了最高潮。十日起一方面由於國軍有力部隊的空運來濟，一方面結集在濟南外團的匪七個殘餘縱隊，由於補給維艱，也不得不被迫於本月四日起，將其中四縱隊分別竄踞汶河兩岸的汶上，寗陽，曲阜，樓德一帶整補訓練，至此濟市七十萬市民，心坎的一塊石頭始着了地。原來已經登記到本年十月的各航空公司的機位，現在由於局勢緩和，也不再如過去的擁塞。在京的魯籍國大立監委和同鄉，曾經爲了要求政府增兵確保濟南，在總統府引起了紛擾的不愉快回憶，至此也算己獲得了補償。</p>
<p>就當前情勢講，在軍事上，濟南的危機已成過去。原在濟市西北郊靠近黃河南岸張莊的舊飛機場，由於生力軍的到達，防務已見增强。濟市環城鐵路雖因限於經費，僅有計劃，動工無期，但濟市東南郊齊魯大學東，上月十八日起所添建的新機塲，在全市各界一致努力下，現已完成一半至本月底，即可全部竣工。這個新機場，不僅使孤島增加了一條空中的新出路，同時，也正爲整個濟南市七十萬生靈，加添了一重最有力的保障。至於濟市內部，目下正已開始一種大規模的肅淸內奸運動，綏區行政公署和軍警稽查處已頒佈了「非常時期戶口管制辦法」。因此，只要緊張時增援部隊能適時空遝到來，濟市絕不致成爲開封第二；同樣地，只要「戶口管制辦法」能認眞執行，則共匪地下組識與潛伏份子，可全部肅淸，濟市自然也絕不致成爲兗州第二。</p>
<p>如從這個角度來看，擺在濟南今後的最大問題，顯而易見，不是軍事而是經濟問題了。匪自七月廿七日起，已正式開始對濟南採取封鎖政策，除掉手携背負的極少數糧食，尙仍照常允許進入市區，換取匪所需要的物資外，其餘自手車·大車·以至馬車汽車所運物資，已全部禁止進口。濟市目下所有存糧，據可靠估計，僅够三月之用，商店由於市民購買力銳减，捐稅攤派，紛至沓來，不勝負荷，多相率倒閉。最近連全市最繁華的二大馬路緯四路上最大的店舖，亦都已相繼停業。市面的簫條不僅使一般小市民的生活水準日趨低下，並且造成了自殺·搶刦等一連串不安的事件，市民中早已發現連窩窩頭都啃不起，而籍豆餅充飢的了。這種危機，惟有希望政府努力克服。</p>

<h3 id="c111">一般物價　市場上流言紛紜　物價向高峯挺進 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>上週物價，承前週末勢之後，週初週中，在高峯上盤旋前進，自週五起，幾又呈跳躍，惟上升之勢，市塲新價，層見迭出，多創新紀錄。</p>
<p>上週批發物價總指數爲六，六五八，二四八倍，較前週上升百分之二八·五九。市塲銀根，較前週略俏，但國行交換情形，週一差出二萬餘億，週四差出一萬餘億，實際不能算緊，暗息走動於四角半上下。</p>
<p>五百萬大鈔迄未發出，市上現鈔奇缺，貼水現象很普遍，同時行莊方面，爲應付提現困難，紛紛開發本票流通市面，據估計數達五十萬億，這不僅違反金管局緊縮信用的原則，且易滋生其他弊端，當局似應注意及之。</p>
<p>上週因港匯暴縮，一般金融性商品，頗饗秀色，飾金由週一二每兩兌進四億三千萬，兌出四億七千萬，升至週末之兌進五傲四千萬，兌出五億八千萬。結匯證在政府支持之下，亦升達七百八十萬元高價。</p>
<p>上週政府各項措施，對於今後物價影饗較爲密切者，約有卞述數喘：</p>
<p>第一，關於新經濟改革方案一案，自七月杪莫千山會議商討後，一時傳說紛紛，公在即，市塲物價，亦頗有以此爲轉移之勢。據悉新方案內容曾涉及平抑物價，鼓勵輸出，吸收僑資，改革幣制，裁併行莊，配合美援諸端，及後遲遲未見公布，變化不絕如縷。現中樞要員，雲集盧山，大概將有重要決策。老實說，今天我國經濟狀况的嚴重，是誰也不能否認的，新方案對於現階段經濟困難的解決，應有決定性的作用，今後的大局好與壤，它應負極大的責任。</p>
<p>第二，今年下半年度總預算的普通部份，巳於十二日由總統府明令公佈，計歲入與歲出總數均爲三百二十三萬六千二百十五億零零九十八萬六千元。這一預算祗是普通部份，對於軍事部份的特別預算並不包括在內，誰都知道戰爭的消耗大，是政府收支不平衡的權結所在，所以單看這一個預算，義意並非如我們想像般的重大。再者，根據過去經驗，最終一個月支出的數字，差不多就等於全年預算支出的數字，以今年物價上漲週率的加速，幅度的擴大，我們對於年終的決算是不敢過份樂觀的。</p>
<p>第三，關於美援運用灰售款處健的問題，最近頗爲各方所車視，中美問的意見亦有相當距離。美援的總額，除掉軍事部份外，共爲二億七千五百萬美元，其原定的分配額爲建設專款六千萬元，糧食七千萬元，棉花七千萬元，石汕五千萬元，肥料一千三百八十萬元，工業配件一千萬元，行政費用一百二十萬元。據賴樸翰氏招待託者宣佈，建設專款可能再加一千萬元，迎同工業配件一千萬元，共計八千萬元。此外七千萬的美棉，據說已決定採取以貨易貨的方式，以棉換紗，以紗外銷，再摘印棉進口。由此看來，這二項共計一億五千萬美元，已有特定用途，不能將物資在國內市塲拋出，吸收通貨，美援力量未免削弱。今天我國經濟危機之嚴重階段，目前應設怯如何渡過這個燃眉之急，以後再談建設復興，所以賴氏的建議，對於吸收通貨這個計劇有無影饗，是值得考慮的。</p>
<p>第四，出售國營事業一案，輾轉經年，迄未見諸實施，如出售招商局一案，最近船聯會秘書長李雲良氏就此事談稱：「此時若干無力維特之民營輸公司瀕於破產，甚至希望政府能予收購改爲國營，藉以卸除重任，不致繼續賠累，因此；政府在此時出售國營招商局，大概祇有兩種資本可以承購，一種係國外資本，一種係豪門資本，前者在攫取我國航權，當然不惜代價；後者恃有特權，自亦無所用其顧慮，政府如貿然將我國壓史最久規模最大之唯一國營航業機構，出讓予外國資本或豪門資本，則航業前途將不堪設想。」至出售中紡公司，當亦不難想像與出售招商局有類似之困難，陷於困局的當前財政，對這一重大措施，究應如何決定？</p>
<p>上週市塲物價走勢，雖在謠豚紛傳下，仍農續上升，迭創新價，這大概因爲謠話終歸是萬　，經濟狀况本身的健全與否，才有決定性的影饗。所以任何經濟方案，若不能從根本處着手，雖或可收效於一時，但終難持久。</p>
<p>紗布市塲方面，上週在視漲心理旺盛之下，市氣最爲奮發，四十二支藍鳳，由週初之廿五億六千萬，盤升至週五之卅三億五千萬，廿一支雙馬，由週初之十九億五千萬，盤升至週初之廿五億五千萬。一二〇號天橋絲亦由週初之廿八億二千萬，步升至週玉之卅五億九千萬。食米在產地頻頻概漲刺繳下，除特粳迫七千萬大關外，其他亦破六關，均創空前新價。油粉亦追踪上升，漲勢銳厲，週末吉桶生油迫近二億，兵船一號粉破二千萬關。日用品如皂火捲烟，亦均上升幅度頗鉅，週五固本皂站八千六百餘萬，美麗火榮升達四億，五百支大英烟站一千一百四十萬。餘如化學品，金屬，建築材料等，亦多掀起漲風，創見新價。</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按用途分類者如次：</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如此：</p>
<p>上週批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如次：</p>
<h3 id="c112">貨幣·金融 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>上週本市銀根，仍呈全面鬆濫之局。國家銀行在一週內雖有三天反出爲進，但一則進數甚微，二則游費存底豐厚，對市塲影響殊輕。據估計，日來累積本市游資，爲數已在一百萬億以上，而當局對於是項游資的處理方策，似有捉襟見肘之感。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹到了某一個階段，鈔荒的發生，亦勢所難免。換句話說，今天物價上漲的連率，已經超過通貨發行的速率了。雖然說這其間有若干乃「人爲的因素一，但通貨數量的增加是主因，人民輕視貨幣所引起的貨幣流通速度的加大等等「人爲因素」是後果，這可說明爲什麼擬議中的經濟新方案，雖一再透露加强管制行莊等等的神經戰術，而銀根始終仍鬆濫如故。銀根放鬆的必然結果是物價狂漲，上週一般物價普遍昂勝，其故即在此。</p>
<p>一方面是銀根鬆濫，一方面是現鈔奇缺，雖然說大鈔的紛紛南去與本市的鈔荒有關，但據銀行業方面的消息，該業向央行所領到的現鈔款項封簽日期，竟有隔日或當日者，這不免使人懷疑我們的鈔票生產力是否足以應付實需，由此也不難看出通貨膨脹巳經到了怎樣嚴重的一個地步。因現鈔缺乏，上週市間大鈔貼水竟有達十分之一者，同時央行又從嚴限止同業領鈔的額度，致行莊本票，普遍流行。據估計每天行莊本票的平均發行額，少則千億，多至萬億以上，總數達五十萬億之譜，此種本票，非當日收回，這樣就使市間銀根，益見鬆濫。</p>
<p>上週暗息，週一週二稍高，在五角四分至四角五分之間，週三以銀根鬆弛，落至三角九分與四角二分，近午濫單迭見，週四雖因需單者轉殷，再昂至四角八分，但週五終以頭寸供源旺盛，而又低見三角九分。至於貨帮貼息，大致在日拆十元至十五元問，週四稍高，爲十八元與二十元。</p>
<p>國家行局交換結果，自週一至週五，其間雖有三大表現爲差進，但在扣除週二的一部份同業定存，及週三中國所吸存款以外，五天內行局尙實出七千六百九十六億，雖說較上週减出達十三萬億有餘，但因市間游資存底雄厚，行局减出，亳未起作用。</p>
<p>外商銀行自週一至週五，共差進五萬六千四百六十五億，較前週同期內减進一萬六千七百〇四億，此項巨額差進，據調大部係資金外逃之結果。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，頭寸非常鬆弛，週三前濫單時有所見，同業拆放，毫未做開，六十號以後行莊交換結果，週二雖見反進爲出，但在扣除台灣銀行之差出數額以後，自週一至週五，實出不過二萬五千五百六十一億，較前週同期內增出七萬九千多億，需單之轉殷，可以概見。物價之止疲爲漲，亦不難田此看出。</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外匯行市，彼動如下：香港申匯自週三起即自六分縮至五分（合法幣十萬元），香港美鈔市價伸縮在五元四角一分與五元四角六分間。黃金每華兩週一爲三三二港元，週四疲至三三〇·七五元。本市結匯證價格週一爲六百萬，週五巳迭漲至七百卅萬元。</p>
<p>銀樓業掛牌飾金價格週一爲四億七千萬與四億三千元，嗣後續有掛高，週末出價達五億八，進價爲五億四，上漲計百分之二十餘。</p>
<p>上週商業銀行內匯率，大致自週二一度提高後，至週五多維持於週二之高水準，如穗匯匯水週一爲三百元，週二起即提高爲四百元，至週五無變動；廈匯匯水週一爲三百元，週二至週五維特於四百五十元之水準，渝匯匯水週一爲二百廿元，週二爲二百五十元，週三週四爲三百元，週五再提升至三百五十元。漢匯匯水週一爲一百八十元，週二提至二百元，至週五仍爲二百元，津匯週三以前爲平匯，週四貼水二十元，週五貼水增爲五十元，當受平津申匯將受限制傳說之影響。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>華股週初開盤，因新經濟改革方案傳說仍濃，內容不悉，多方不無顧慮，空方則見活躍，市勢疲檔徘徊，計永紗以一三八五〇元開盤，一四一〇〇元收盤，他股除聯華漲停外，起伏互見，波動幅度不大。</p>
<p>次臼因報載新經濟改革方案將延至月底公佈，兼之銀根鬆濫，圈外物價紛紛報漲，市勢脫疲轉堅，頓告欣欣向榮。計永紗，美亞，信和，統益，信誼，中火，中泥，華新，上泥，永業，聯華，閘北，中興，梅林，大通等十五種均等登漲限。</p>
<p>週三因受金融性物品及結匯證騰漲影響，形勢續趨堅俏，計水紗漲　一六三二〇元收盤，美亞漲達七三八元收盤，他股中以閘北，信誼，兩種軋跌外，餘均軋漲。</p>
<p>週四起，因受日上漲，已登高峯，過程步軟，熱門股如永紗，美亞，景福，中絲，華新，麗安，國貨等七種軋跌外，餘均上漲，并有中泥，永業，中興三種漲停。</p>
<p>週五因圈外物價騰漲，新經濟改革方案消息沉寂，在多方哄抬下，市勢頗爲堅挺，結果永紗以一七〇五〇元收盤，較上日軋升七五〇元。其他各股中除中泥跌停，恒豐，華瓷，共三種軋跌外，餘均上漲，並有信誼，中怯，華新，永業，聯華，中興等六種漲停。</p>
<p>週末因傳說紛紛，買方人心虛軟，獲利吐售，浮空活躍，市勢疲降，永紗以一五九〇〇元收盤，較上日高價，挫瀉一六〇〇元，他股中僅信誼獨秀，餘均一致軋跌。</p>

<p>〔中央社倫敦十四電〕世運會各項比賽，已舉行完畢，對其眞正意義，現似可作一估計。記者於世運，始終在塲，私人　感與多數運動家評論家及觀察十家之觀惑，完全相同，即本屆倫敦世運，不特在運動技術方面，即在表現五十二年前創立世運會時所樹之理想方面，皆有極大成就。大會開幕之日，運動員及參觀者，於溫布萊運動塲上，皆見八英尺高之記分牌上，　有近代世運曾創始人古伯丁男爵之簡短而富有意義之詞句：「世運會之所重，不在獲勝，而在參加。人生之要義，不在克服，而在奮鬥」。古氏如尙健在，親見與其崇高理想相符之世揮精神，在本屆各種競技中，表現無遣，當必感快慰。各種膚色及宗教信仰不同之運動員，前來參加各種比賽，爭販錦標，運動員處此緊張空氣下，摻以爲國爭光之熱情，實極易引起在表面上足爲破壞和睦不幸事件。然世運舉行兩週，除少數不重要之誤會，及裁判之錯誤以外，溫布萊運動塲上，尙未見國際間發生爭執，及某國表示怨憤之嚴重事件發生。參與比賽者，確依眞正之運動精神，努力奮鬥。遂日參觀世界最優秀遝動員，實地表演之觀眾，對獲勝者不問其國　爲何，既報以歡呼。本屆倫敦世運，無疑將爲疲於戰爭之世界巾，各國問之和平先鋒使者，就運動技術而言，聞近代歷屆世運會，從無如比次世運之驚人表現，打破世運記錄之田徑及其他各運動項目，計在二十以上，誠爲一偉大成就。世人所能　揚欣羨者，亦不過如此。我國與其以參與比賽之國家相可，雖未奪得錦標，確曾　力奮鬥，我籃球隊確有奇異表現，在初期循　淘汰賽，我隊以籃球投中最高之得分記錄，擊敗伊拉克。我萬米選手樓文敖，在其他十三人連世界萬米記錄保持者海諾在內，中途退出後，爲跑畢全程之最後一人。觀眾對其良好精神，深爲感動，向其表示歡呼熱烈，並不拒於其對冠軍柴托貝克所表示者。樓文敖在二十五英里長之馬拉松賽跑中，再度鼓勇，並於五英里處，跑至第二，於半程中保特第六，但因足部水泡劇痛，而不得不退出。自由車一千公尺競賽，我國惟一參加者何浩華，以較英吋之差而敗挫，且與其敵手之車相碰，至摔下傷肩，不能參加其也自由車比賽項月，誠命也如斯。我國飽經戰禍，由於事實上之困難，僅以一籃球隊，一足球隊及極少之田徑賽運動員參加世運，不在奪獲錦標，而在增進世運之眞正精神。王正廷氏有言，今年世運對我國之眞　要義，乃我國經十年苦戰後，居然能參與其　。託者深信待國內局勢平靜，稍假時日，來年世運曾中，必有更好之表現。至本屆世運會地主國英國本身困苦重重，此次担負極其細微錯綜之工作，使此次世運有偉大成就，實令人景仰。吾人自不能希望處於經濟困難巾之英國，能以一九三六年之柏林世運之同等，舉辦本屆世運，蓋希特勒原即利用世運而舖張納粹之實力者。但英國確巳　其所能，堪稱極佳之地主國。此次世運，就出席參觀及獲利而言，亦爲一成功之運動會。</p>
<h3 id="c117">世運籃球第一戰　我隊敗於智利記 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鍾震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕七月三十日世界運動會此賽的第一天，下午七時三十分，吾國中華隊與智利隊在倫敦市東部哈林蓋健身房（Harringay　Arena），作首次籃球淘汰寶。此次比賽原訂於八月二日（星期一）比賽，三十日晨忽公佈更改之消息，故是日觀眾寥落，僅佔塲中座位十分之三，而吾國僑胞前往捧塲者亦不多，因國人十九都未及知曉。</p>
<p>竟出冷門</p>
<p>此次賽程經過，驚險萬狀，中華隊有極大獲勝之希望，但結果竟出冷門，以五分之差，敗於智利之手。失敗之原因，李世僑之病困星島，不克出席，也屬其中原因之一，而主要的，還是由於先大的缺陷—體格矮小，及方法不如，動作遲緩，連絡欠佳。相反的智利隊球藝雖屬平平，可是球員體格魁梧，動作緊凑迅速，及守衛嚴密。中華隊之三鋒，全被監視，重重阻擋下，竟究全失却近投之機會。其所得分數，全賴蔡文華之遠擲。我國隊之守衛因體力懸殊，竟一籌莫展。記者會見智利隊前鋒，輾轉亙遞，接速投近球籃六七次之多，而中華隊守衛，竟苦於無法制止。若論球藝，遠勝智利，個人之演出，尤爲精彩，異邦觀眾，大加讚賞，雖敗猶榮。比賽詳情，記錄如次：</p>
<p>天錫罰出</p>
<p>開球後，智利隊先聲奪人，攻勢兇猛，球完全被控制，但幸其射籃不準，良機屢失，而中華隊雖極少獲球之機會，但每射必中，分數始終非常接近，由三對九，追至八對十三。吳成章調出後，再度登塲，遠擲近投，運建奇功，造成十四比十二，祗相差一球之局勢。但不幸在上半時行將結束前五分鐘，黃天錫因犯規四次被罰出場，由李震中調入，我方連絡欠佳，轉遞不靈，智利隊乘隙戰成十四，十九之局面。巾華隊奮起猛追，蔡文華遠射巧建奇功，追成十八對十九，僅相差一分。智利隊大起恐慌，運呼「暫停」，鐘聲一饗，上半時告結束，吾方僅輪一分。此時觀眾猜測紛紛，半數以上，皆以我方必勝，因智利隊球藝委實不靈，祇要我方能有獲球機會，必能秦捷。</p>
<p>力戰受挫</p>
<p>檸機時間後，智利隊東山再起，大局仍爲其所控，幸其前鋒射籃毫無把握，均屬虛擲，所以分數仍相差無幾。我方不甘示弱一，由十八對二十一，追成二十一對二十四，蔡文華精彩演出，遙射「運中三元」，博得滿堂采聲。至最後六分鐘，成三十六對四十，相差二球。塲內外之空氣益覺緊張，看客頻呼「加汕」，中華隊籃球教練宋君復面紅耳赤，着急萬分，因此次若能戰勝智利，我隊前途遠大，惜乎球運不佳，包松圓罰球不進，反因犯規被黜出塲，於于瑞章調入，實力又爲削弱，雖苦力掙扎，終因大勢已去，無法挽回，以卅九對四十四敗於智利隊。</p>
<p>此次裁判爲友慈林及恩派里，執法嚴厲，球員動輙被判犯規，二隊隊員罰球，失誤屢屢，巾華隊二人被劃出塲，對戰局大受影饗。中華隊之陣容：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國立西藏拉蕯學校爲國內唯一國立小學。該校校長邢肅芝（蒙藏委員會專員），因自卅六年度以來，即未由國家獲得匯款，漫長歲月，學校於飢餓巾苦渡，服務人員生活極度困苦，月前經印度返京述職，曾向各方奔走呼籲，催撥十八個月欠發經費，迄今尙未獲政院通過。</p>

<p>鮑忠祈</p>
<p>大概寒士們對於書籍都有一點偏愛，一卷在手，愛不忍釋，新册古本，視作珍藏。</p>
<p>讀本刋白永先生的「　雹隨記」提醒了我，區區的幾本藏書也好久沒有去匯顧它們了，倒並不是我對它們忽視，實在是一則我住在學校裏的時候比較多，二則因爲我缺少一個較大的書櫥，不能整整齊齊的編排陳列起來，每次爲了參考需要我尋一本書後，就非得翻箱倒　不可，結果弄得　亂無章，七零八落，而又沒有機會去加以整理，我一直電爲這是一個莫大的遺憾。可是現在連一本新書都買不起的我，除非論斤秤兩的把舊書賣掉，才有資格買書櫥，不過那却　徒有空皮夾而沒有鈔票一樣的笑話，所以，書櫥的希望始終沒怯去實現。</p>
<p>趁着暑期的空閒，我發興把雜堆在一起的書籍搬上晒台去，也顧不得驕陽施虐，我揮着汗一本一本地打開來，讓這些整年不見天日的書本，沐一個暢快的日光浴。</p>
<p>像故友重逢似的，我一會兒與那浮生六託中的沈復招呼，一曾兒又與馬克吐溫筆底下的湯姆莎耶寒暄。看着這一大堆的書報，有許多紙質已泛黃色的，它們的年齡也許比我還大，這大多是父親或是大哥們所珍藏的，其他的都是我十數年來累積買來的，它們增長了我不少的知識，我曾經爲它們陶醉過，今天好像又溫了一次舊夢。</p>
<p>我得意地望着：古　，新卷，薄本，厚册，中文的，英文的，文藝的，科學的，開本小的……，我突然發現一件奇怪的事，我用手把眼睛重重地揩了一下，怎麼，開本較大的一些書都那裏去了？我急得幾乎跳了起來，我返身奔回那間堆書的小室，那裏還有影蹤呢？</p>
<p>我於是想起了月前被母親辭退的一個女傭，因爲她偷竊報紙供給她的情人——一個賣魚的販子，被發現了。我彷彿看見那些主婦們手中的包魚紙就是我的書，我好像看見那些書已經碎屍片片！</p>
<p>沒精打彩地回上晒台，我看看那些幸未遭刧的言，不禁痛心那些已喪失了的，這裏還包括了一部我最心愛的辭源。</p>
<p>這是我自己不小心的後果，這些書不毀於砲火之中，而斷送在這種情形下，豈不可惜？</p>
<p>太陽落入了西方的屋頂下，我收下了曝晒一日的盡。第二日，我化了一整天的時間去整理，分類編目，放入箱子後，我加了一把鎖。</p>
<p>買一架書櫥的願望，又復盪漾在腦際了。</p>
<h3 id="c134">漫談輓聯 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>本談常有同文撰「聯語」。按此道在我國文學史上隸旁支，然其難比文詩詞尤甚。輓聯亦屬聯語之一，茲舉幾則談談。</p>
<p>袁世凱一代奸雄，玩弄淸廷，背叛民國，新華稱帝，挫於蔡鍔，一氣而好。像輓這種人，不易落筆，怎樣措辭呢？孫師鄭有兩聯輓他。其一云：一病　長眠，且莫論帝制民權，可憐蓋世英雄，到今日都成幻夢。　　萬方正多難，願此後寗人息事，欲定千秋功罪，在諸君各問良心！一其二云：「平生僅兩面，尙在我公出任疆圻，人參政事之年；雕蟲小拔，曾感私知，伏　有心憐老驥。一「萬眾句一心，庶免中國就烹鼎俎，乞命刀來之慘；幕燕危機，每深永歡，躍淵無首現羣能！「第一聯寓　責於惋歡之中，下聯隱含褒意。第二聯上聯言私交，下聯希望全國統一，惜袁自誤。這兩聯俱煞費苦心。</p>
<p>蔡松坡將軍之卒，輓聯自然容易著筆了。像態希齡聯云：「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已；薄葬有遺言，尙以未沒疆塲爲恨。」「雄亡固存，邦乃其昌；誓師服大義，曾無自利天下之心。」又蒲殿俊聯云：「遺言作一世箴規，知盡瘁爲國之心，死猶未已。」「此中關百年興廢，以義戰成功而止，天竟如何！」袁黨倪嗣冲聯云：「飛將歟？飛仙歟？躍馬東溟，騎鯨東海。一「先民也，先覺也；哀　衛國，鑄識越都」。這聯不知出誰代筆，似先有下聯，後有上聯，「飛汕一二字，硬凑可笑。</p>
<p>黃克强氏病卒滬上，我有一聯輓云：「我亦未知公之可欽，第觀唁詞哀電，報章連幅而刊；同志名流，涕泣臨門而弔。觸目驚心，已極中華最慘事！」「君應遺恨國尙多故，回思墨美瀛嶠，歷路途者萬里；共和民主，經維持者五年。苦行卓節，盡付歇浦永逝波！」這聯曾採入商務書館聯語彙選，故今還記得。</p>
<p>亡長兒敦誼於民國廿六年畢業中大中國文學系時，曾自題其手册云：「相守百年都是夢，偶同一飯莫非緣！」不料竟成語纖，卒於民國廿九年。舐犢情深，我輓以一聯云：「生無補，死無聞，相守百年都是夢，於今騐矣！」「來何因？去何故？偶同一飯莫非緣，安忍思之！」當時友人見之，均謂語甚沉痛，可存。</p>

<p>銷夏三日吟</p>
<p>汲將井水爲凉茶，略有紅黃看廈花，睡起北窗無個事，洗刀重破活籐瓜。</p>
<p>相逢朋舊有招要，天遣三盅魯酒　，引向田田風力晚，隨緣忽過兩三橋！</p>
<p>雀噪蟬嘶巳夕陽，溫湯浴能好相羊，東塲走過西塲坐，閑話當年舊事長。</p>
<p>袒棵能安謝家煩，汗多宜戒把書翻，北天雲黑旋飛散，月上西墻蟬又繁。</p>
<p>兒笑娘雜遞看忙，午鷄報蛋得重黃！後園摘取西紅柿，炒合應須祭酒腸。</p>
<p>新長絲瓜一筷長，葡萄架畔掛簫牆，尙書浜上茅蘆在，不見詩翁舊姓王！</p>
<p>可能胸次一塵無？深坐宵來靜自娛，天上繁星解　語，人間萬事笑成迂。</p>
<p>紫薇艷發映淸池，綠竹凉多好下　，暫喜不聞天下事，却憐諸子論雄雌！</p>
<p>意惓神昏發興難，　夫懶不廢三餐！上人觸熱求書扇，三葉雙花却寫蘭。</p>

<p>鄭大鶴（文焯）詞與王半塘米古微齊名，金石書畫，無不精妙絕倫。予在蘇州日，先後購得其書畫三幅，暨手批手校書籍四種，於大鶴亦洵有綠巳！</p>
<p>畫爲山水小幅，風神獨絕，題詩云：「雲河容小艇，天地着閒人。」字則一爲自寫「陽春曲」詞稿，一錄韓詩，筆致挺拔，實出魏碑。</p>
<p>予所得大鶴手批「松壺先生集」，前後共有六手跋，藏即縈樂，且五六十。復有一「侍兒南柔同賞」一印。大鶴晚年寓居吳門，好作狹斜游，自稱：「吳趨故坊，阜橋新豸，連情花月，流志管弦，西北高樓，時有　跡。匪乎好色，曷云寡歡？遺世之傷，焉能己已。……」解嘲而已。其姬人特多，有名氏可考者，復有一「可可」，於其所批校書中恒見之。大鶴暮歲潦倒不堪，恒携一老妾枯坐茶樓，尙自謂風流，抑亦詞人之結習也。</p>
<p>大鶴好駡人，雖於其師潘伯寅亦不免，松壺先生集」乃伯寅囑徐花農太史以行書手寫刋行者。大鶴乃議之曰：「竊謂自來鈔書，鮮有是體，宋槧多效歐陽率吏體，元官本刻經史，私家刋集，皆慕趙吳興書格，江南嘉道間，景刻謀本，寫樣多出許幹屏，近則金生並能以手按名世；視此有仙凡之隔。若使澗蘋菱圃古餘諸賢見之，定爲絕倒。……」又云：「此書體純以側媚筆怯作行書勢，不惟悖古，且於寫書例亦大失。此年以來，以翰林官作此派書者，吳中最盛，如江建霞費君直輩，並足相與頡頏，幾忘濫觴於花農矣。誌此以爲鈔胥及士夫錄古籍者厚誠焉！」任情議彈，並世勝流治板本學者，幾無一或免焉。然其說則良是。晚淸名流，類好駡人，是亦一時風氣也。</p>
<p>「淮南萬畢術」，乃吳伯宛舍人（昌綬）手鈔，大鶴校補，朱墨紛披，語語有本。大鶴固精岐黃之術，且嘗懸壺應診也。</p>
<p>「印人傳」，「櫟園讀書錄」，亦有大鶴手跋，其論書畫論治印，俱有精到語。康有爲稱大鶴卒前一臼彌留，屬其子復培以後事托有爲，有爲乃往經紀其喪，問所藏書畫骨董，皆已幫盡。則其暮境頹唐可知矣！康有爲爲撰墓表，稱謂詞人。世人亦但艷稱其冷紅詞而已，其著述甚富，豈足以詞限之耶？</p>

<p>花史載：「鄭榮嘗作金錢花詩未就，夢一紅裳女子擲錢與之，曰：爲君潤筆！及覺，探懷中得花數孕，遂戯呼爲潤筆花。」</p>
<p>據考潤筆花實爲金錢花，又名子午花，以午開子落，故名。花秋開黃色，朵如錢，綠葉柔枝，娟秀可愛。</p>
<p>園林草木疏云：「梁大同中，進自外國，今在處有之，栽磁盆中，副以小竹架，亦書室中雅玩也。」</p>
<p>皮日休金錢花詩云：「陰陽爲炭地爲爐，鑄出金錢不用模，謾向人前逞顏色，不知還解濟貧無？」別有寄託也。</p>
<p>凡酬人書畫及稿費，概曰「潤筆」，但今日最無出息者，亦唯靠筆生活的一羣，而潤簽花偏名「金錢」，顧名思義，殊覺太不合邏緝矣。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Hunter Discusses Impressions of Visit to China: Believes Military Aid More Important Than Economic Aid; Currency Reform Should Wait for Situation to Improve <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Graham, Texas, 14th Dispatch] Hunter, a famous Far East trader and chairman of the board of Shanghai Wei Li Han Company, who recently returned from a visit to China, said at his residence here today: The general impression of this trip is that American aid arriving in China must be quickly and most effectively utilized. Hunter visited the East as the chairman of the Far East Subcommittee of the American Foreign Trade Committee for commercial inspection. He said that he is preparing to submit his report on trade in China to the American Foreign Trade Committee for discussion at the board meeting next month. Any recommendations that the committee may make in the future regarding Sino-American economic relations will affect American policy toward China, because the Foreign Trade Committee is the most powerful economic organization in the United States. In Hunter's view, the key to the current problems in China is not when the Chinese government can implement reforms, but how American military and economic assistance can be quickly and effectively utilized. He believes that military assistance is more important, saying that if the military situation can be improved, China's economic and social problems can gradually be brought back on track. He personally believes that, given the seriousness of the threat of Chinese communism, the American government will accelerate the implementation of its aid to China plan. Hunter believes that it is impractical for China to carry out currency reform before the military situation is significantly improved. Rather than issuing a new currency that still does not have the trust and support of the people, it is better to allow the legal currency to continue to depreciate during this period. Issuing new currency without sufficient reserves is tantamount to economic suicide.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Certain Authoritative Person Discusses Reasons for Recent Price Surge <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] A certain authoritative person told reporters on the 15th that the recent sudden and dramatic surge in prices has had a very serious impact on people's livelihood and society. The next one or two months will be the most difficult period for our country's economy. At this time, American aid materials have not yet been effectively deployed and utilized, and many American aid materials have not yet arrived. Therefore, the economic difficulties can be said to have reached a . However, after this, American aid materials will come in continuously, and the economic difficulties can be improved compared to before. The authoritative person analyzed the reasons for the recent price surge in four points: (1) The mischief of idle funds, the financial institutions are rampant, causing idle funds to move in the market and stimulate the rise in prices. (2) The national banks have also failed to fulfill their responsibilities. (3) Gold and US dollars often lead the rise in prices. Gold and US dollars have become the target of speculation for idle funds. Taking June as an example, the black market price of US dollars is twice as high as the exchange settlement certificate, which shows that most buyers of US dollars are speculators, rather than engaging in promoting international trade. (4) The economic plan has been rumored for a long time, but it has not been announced and implemented, and speculators have slightly restrained themselves due to the rumors of the new economic plan. Now they see that the new plan has not been announced, so they have become active again. The authoritative person believes that if the government implements new financial policies, controls idle funds, and strengthens financial control, then prices can be expected to stabilize, so as to tide over the current economic difficulties.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 14th Dispatch] Due to the extensive suppression of the National Army in northern Henan, the bandits' political organization and the people's hearts have been greatly lost and shaken. In order to reverse the decline, the bandits are willing to sacrifice and launch more than 10,000 people to stir up trouble, which will be an opportunity for the National Army to capture the main force of the bandits. The National Army will take this opportunity to clarify the situation in northern Henan. According to military intelligence, at 3:00 AM on the 13th, more than 1,000 bandits carried two cannons and invaded Qimen (northeast of Xinxiang). After the National Army counterattacked, they fled. Also, the main force of the 41st and 42nd Brigades of Chen's Bandit 14th Column, entrenched near Anyang, has recently passed through Caiyuan, Wuling, and Junxian and stirred towards the National Army control area. Their main force has already fled to Shadian, Liuwei, and Liyuantun. The area seems to have the intention of invading Jixian. Also, the 36th Division of Zhang Gonggan's unit, with three regiments of troops, and in cooperation with the local communists, is also stirring in the triangle area of ​​Yanchang. Their purpose seems to be to contain the National Army and respond to Chen's Bandit 14th Column. The National Army, which advanced eastward along the Xin-Yan Highway, reached Yanzhou Village on the 13th, and will join another National Army to the north on the 14th to bypass and enter the battlefield. An annihilation war will unfold in the triangle area of ​​Xinxiang, , and Yanjin.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 15th Dispatch] Military Intelligence: The front line in northern Henan was silent all day. After looting some food in Liyuantun, the main force of Chen's Bandit 14th Column is now gathering in Qimen. The 356th and 357th Regiments of Bandit 36th Division retreated to the area of ​​Huanqiu and Niuti Tun on the 14th. The elite troops of the National Army reached Yanjin on the 14th. According to current observations, the main intention of the bandits is to attack the local teams. They have no power to attack the main strongholds of the National Army. The threat to Jixian has been lifted. In addition, the Bandit 14th Column and the 36th Division entrenched in northern Henan have now merged their numbers into the 3rd and 8th Columns. Recently, they have shown a tendency to flee south across the Yellow River to replenish the exhausted Chen's Bandit 3rd and 8th Columns. Therefore, this time, the stirrings of the bandits in northern Henan are judged to be purely disturbances.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch] After months of investigation, it is claimed that there is still no news of the bell that Okuma Shigenobu took away from Suzhou. Isano Yuzo, director of the Japanese Civil Affairs Bureau, has refuted the allegations made by the Buddhist Association through the Allied Headquarters. According to him, Okuma was born in 1839 and died in 1922 and never went to China. Okuma's grandson Nobu and Waseda University President Shimada Koichi also insisted on this. Therefore, it is believed that Okuma Shigenobu could not have taken the bell away. Isano Yuzo believes that the bell was indeed brought to Japan, but very early, or even possibly transported by antique dealers during the Song Dynasty. It is not known where it is currently hidden in Japan. Isano pointed out that when the Japanese Yamada visited Suzhou in 1898, he discovered that Hanshan Temple had become a ruin and the ancient bell was also missing. He then made a vow to rebuild the ancient temple and served as the deputy abbot of the temple for ten years to complete his wish. At that time, Yamada informed the Japanese Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi about the loss of the ancient bell. Ito then ordered a search for the bell throughout Japan. Later, in the spring of 1905, it was confirmed that the bell had already been washed into Japan, but it had already disappeared without a trace at that time. Ito then initiated the casting of another bell and presented the new bell to Hanshan Temple in 1910.</p>

<h3 id="e23">New Atmosphere in East Asia <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The inaugural ceremony of the Republic of Korea was held solemnly in Seoul yesterday. General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, and Liu Yuwan, our country's ambassador to Korea, both attended. The U.S. government simultaneously issued a statement temporarily recognizing the Korean government and appointing Macano as a special representative. Great Britain and Canada will also follow the U.S.'s lead and recognize the Korean government. The establishment of the new Korean government is not only a milestone in the Korean people's movement to restore their country and achieve unification, but also a new stage in the vigorous rise of nationalism in East Asia, which is of great significance. In particular, the new Korean government chose yesterday as its founding day, making August 15th even more of one of the greatest and most memorable days in East Asian history. Three years ago, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and formally announced its unconditional surrender, ending this unprecedentedly tragic war and igniting humanity's hope for peace and prosperity. In particular, the oppressed peoples of East Asia, encouraged by the defeat of the invaders, stood up to pursue freedom and demand liberation. Two years later, India was the first to achieve liberation, and India and Pakistan became twin countries in East Asia. Yesterday was their first anniversary, and in the northeast corner of Asia, the establishment of the Korean government brought double happiness to the door, which is even more worthy of the joy and celebration of the Asian people.</p>
<p>From a geographical perspective, Korea is strategically located between China, Japan, and the Soviet Union. It can be said to be a bridge between the Japanese archipelago and the Asian continent, and also a bridge between China and the Soviet Union. It is indeed a major cornerstone of peace and security in East Asia. However, in the past fifty years, Korea has suffered from Japanese aggression and persecution, leading to the loss of its nation until August 15th three years ago, when Japan surrendered unconditionally, and Korea was liberated from the clutches of Japanese imperialism. During the war, the major Allied powers successively issued the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, guaranteeing Korea's freedom and independence. However, after the victory, Korea not only failed to immediately realize its desire for national restoration and unification, but its national destiny was also misled by power politics. The Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945 decided that Korea would first be jointly administered by China, the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union for five years, and then be allowed to become independent. Therefore, the northern and southern regions of Korea were occupied by the United States and the Soviet Union; and because of the different ideologies and conflicting interests of the United States and the Soviet Union, the division of Korea was further deepened, creating a situation of north-south division.</p>
<p>However, the division of Korea is not only a tragedy for the Korean people, but also a misfortune for East Asia. In view of this, the United Nations decided to first hold a separate general election in the U.S.-occupied area of southern Korea, convene a national assembly, formulate a democratic constitution, and elect a president and vice president. Then, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, it would organize a new independent and democratic government of Korea, which was finally formally established yesterday. China and Korea are as close as brothers, and their relationship is as close as lips and teeth. In the past, China not only sympathized with the Korean independence movement, but also provided strong support without exception. During the Cairo Conference, our country's President Chiang's efforts to fight for Korea's independence and liberation were already known to the world. Now that the Korean government has been established, China is the first to recognize it in fact, giving it immediate international status. The United States naturally does not want to be left behind and also recognizes it. Now that the position of the new Korean government has been stabilized, it can take South Korea as the starting point for unifying the entire country. We will see Korea gradually unified and restored to its former glory, and we cannot help but rejoice for the future of East Asia.</p>
<p>Just as we are enthusiastically celebrating the establishment of the Korean government, we also happily celebrate the first anniversary of the new India. China and India are the two largest countries in Asia, not only with long histories and the oldest civilizations, but also with large populations and abundant resources. Moreover, between China and India, for thousands of years, there has been cultural exchange and no conflict of interest. Since the victory, the opinions of the representatives of China and India have always been consistent at any meeting of the United Nations. However, looking at the cultural exchange between China and India and the connection between the two countries today, we still cannot but think that it is not enough. We still have to double our efforts, especially the people of both sides should double their efforts to promote friendly relations between the two countries, work together hand in hand, and jointly seek a long-term plan for peace in East Asia. Indian Ambassador to China Panikkar also has the same feeling. In his letter to the Chinese people, in addition to expressing his cherishment of China's friendship, he firmly advocated that China and India work together side by side to ensure peace in Asia. We believe that this is by no means diplomatic rhetoric. Indeed, the full cooperation of the two major countries of China and India can bring together 800 million people, which is the most powerful guarantee for peace in Asia.</p>
<p>In short, pre-war Asia was a colony of Western powers. Now we see the scene of the vigorous rise of Asian nationalism. The new India has just celebrated its first anniversary, and the great Korea has also been born. The future of Asia is full of light, which makes us even more convinced that as long as the Republic of China, as the "elder brother," can strive for self-improvement and unite with the newly independent and democratic countries of Asia with a renewed spirit, to jointly seek peace and prosperity in Asia, then the bright future of East Asia can be fully realized one day.</p>

A total of 1.2 trillion yuan is needed. (2) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will assist in the supply of equipment and purchase sleepers on behalf of the mines for distribution, which requires 500 billion yuan. (3) Build railway branch lines and distribution roads to major coal mines to facilitate coal transportation, which requires approximately 300 billion yuan.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th] According to Hong Kong news: Due to the Hong Kong side's delay in implementing the China-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement, the public security on the Guangdong-Hong Kong border has also been greatly affected. For example, the Shark Pass incident occurred because the Communist bandits sheltered smugglers. According to Luo Qingxiang of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the General Customs Administration: If the agreement can be implemented, according to the agreement, customs anti-smuggling vessels can inspect ships entering and leaving the marked sea area near the Chinese coast in Ma Shi Bay. After the smuggled ships are seized and handed over to the Hong Kong authorities for determination as smuggled goods, they will be returned to our customs for confiscation or supplementary tax. In this way, the Chinese coast of Ma Shi Bay can be blocked, and the bandits on the shore will have no profit to ask for and will inevitably retreat. Therefore, the current anti-smuggling stalemate depends on the implementation of the agreement to break. It is believed that the current Chinese and Hong Kong authorities are actively discussing this agreement. After Chairman Song Ziwen returns to Guangdong, he will make decisive negotiations with Hong Kong. Luo's visit to Hong Kong this time may be related to this matter.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Taipei, 15th] The brewing dispute over Japanese-owned houses in Taiwan is becoming more apparent. The crux of the problem is that the provincial government is encircling privately owned houses of Japanese people as public property. Part of this batch of houses has already been taken over by native Taiwanese and civil servants from other provinces who have signed leases with the Japanese Property Management Office. The provincial government then ordered the Japanese Property Management Office to cancel the leases as a prelude to recovery. Although this order has not been implemented yet, the encircled residents are generally very panicked, because once it is implemented, tens of thousands of people will be displaced. The reporter has visited government officials and local people in recent days. Government officials have decided to form a mediation committee to find a win-win solution. Local people believe that the so-called public property houses should be based on the original register of the Governor-General's Office, and privately owned houses of Japanese people should not be fabricated. Pu Xuefeng, the newly appointed Director of the Public Property Consolidation Committee of the provincial government, is studying new methods. Regarding the issue of the sale of Japanese property, Wu Chongquan, director of the Japanese Property Management Office, stated that the valuation will be based on the original shell, and the newly installed equipment will not be included. The order of sale will also depend on the application of the current residents.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Reviving Rural China (Part 1) - A Record of a Conversation with Mr. Y.C. James Yen <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The disaster-stricken Chinese countryside, devastated by years of war, appears even more shattered. The collapse of the rural economy not only shakes the foundation of the entire social economy but also directly and indirectly wounds the nation's lifeline. The China Rural Reconstruction Joint Commission was thus established in response to the times. With a substantial amount of US aid, approximately $27.5 million, and full support from the government, combined with the talents of Chinese and American experts, success is foreseeable. In other words, the commission already possesses the three prerequisites for the success of any large-scale undertaking: financial resources, manpower, and political power. It is particularly important to point out here that the programs and plans to be implemented in the future were not formulated overnight, nor were they drafted by foreign experts in laboratories and libraries, but rather are the crystallization of the painstaking efforts of pioneers from all walks of life in our country who have been engaged in the rural reconstruction movement for the past thirty years.</p>
<p>Since the early years of the Republic, the Chinese people have begun to pay attention to the rural movement. Among the many leading experts, Mr. Y.C. James Yen, who founded the National Association of the Mass Education Movement and engaged in rural work in Ding County, is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished and internationally renowned figures. He currently serves as the Executive Director of the Rural Reconstruction Joint Commission. I recently had the opportunity to have a long conversation with Mr. Yen and have recorded its gist to share with readers:</p>
<p>The Education of Power - Mr. Yen is a scholar who values practicality. He believes that China's resources lie in the Chinese people, and that China's great latent power must be discovered from among the people. He said, looking around the world today, everything is subject to the strength or weakness of power. "The powerful rule, the powerless are enslaved!" Those with power dominate others, those without power can only be dominated. Only when the people unleash their own power can they become the masters of a democratic country, and only then can the country be said to be prosperous and strong. What is power? Knowledge is power, production is power, health is power, organization is power. Mr. Yen specifically pointed out that in order to discover the infinite power hidden among the hundreds of millions of farmers, and in order to address and solve the four shortcomings of Chinese farmers: "ignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness," the meaning of poverty and weakness is very clear and requires no explanation; ignorance is not innate, but is due to the lack of educational opportunities and the inability to express their talents and wisdom; selfishness is also not innate, but is due to the lack of organizations for collective empowerment. Since 1923, Mr. Yen and his comrades have advocated promoting "literacy education, livelihood education, health education, and civic education" in rural areas. In order to make the terms universally understandable, Mr. Yen also renamed the four types of education that rural construction relies on as the four educations of rural literacy, production, health, and organization, coordinating with each other, with the aim of tapping the latent great power of farmers. In short, the four educations together form a complete "education of power."</p>
<p>Literacy Education for Cultivating Knowledge Power; Literacy education includes both literacy education and art education. The former focuses on teaching ordinary people to read and acquire basic education. The Mass Education Movement has worked to promote literacy campaigns and has engaged in research and editing of textbooks and supplementary reading materials needed for poverty alleviation education, selecting some commonly used words and nouns to be used for teaching. With regard to art education, the Mass Education Movement has also been engaged in research and writing for many years, creating tools for art education and performing and demonstrating, using drama, storytelling, film, paintings, and radio broadcasts, music performances, to improve the artistic life of farmers, and sprinkle various common sense.</p>
<p>Production Education to Increase Rural Wealth; The content of production education roughly includes four aspects: first, agriculture, such as crop improvement, horticulture, livestock improvement, pest control, fertilizer application, etc.; second, economics, such as the organization of cooperative societies for production and marketing, credit loans, agricultural production methods, and rural economic systems; third, rural crafts, such as cotton and wool textiles, silk and tea production, agricultural tools, and all processing and manufacturing crafts, etc.; fourth, agricultural engineering, such as agricultural tool improvement, the application of mechanization, and the construction of farmland irrigation, etc. Mr. Yen particularly emphasized that the increase in farmers' own production is not enough to improve farmers' lives unless farmers are aware and enlightened and rise up to manage their own affairs? Such as cooperative organizations for agricultural product management and credit, sales, and marketing, in order to avoid exploitation by intermediate classes, farmers can directly obtain benefits, and gradually reform the entire rural economic system. Speaking of the issue of agricultural mechanization, Mr. Yen said: "When agricultural production increases, farmers' cooperation and management skills improve, and farmers have education and organization, etc., agricultural mechanization will be more powerful."</p>
<p>Health Education to Promote Strong Farmers; In order to promote farmers' hygiene and medical treatment of diseases, the Mass Education Movement has made a very important contribution, which is the creation of a new rural medical system. They established health centers and affiliated health stations in Ding County, and set up a number of health workers in villages and towns to undertake the task of farmers' medical and health care, which is the beginning of the health center system that was implemented before the war and is currently being implemented. Mr. Yen believes that in China today, where financial resources are scarce and medical talents are in short supply, preventing diseases in rural areas is even better than medical treatment. Some infectious diseases, such as smallpox, cholera, etc., can be prevented in advance, and the prevention of diseases should be promoted universally, and attention should be paid to the nutrition of farmers. Mr. Yen believes that agricultural products with rich nutritional value, such as soybeans, tomatoes, etc., can be encouraged to be planted more by the people, so as to increase their daily nutrition. Also, the completion of health education lies in spreading health knowledge to the people on the one hand, and cultivating healthy habits among the people on the other hand, both of which require the gradual guidance of rural movement work. Mr. Yen said: "To govern a village, we must first build the people," the ultimate goal of health education is to improve the "vitality" of the people, and only then will the countryside have the basic conditions for all construction.

<h3 id="e43">Forty Years of Struggle Finally Leads to Freedom The Korean Government Declares Its Establishment Syngman Rhee Delivers a Speech Willing to Extend a Hand of Friendship to the Soviet Union The US Transfers Power in Korea Today <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 15th] The government of the Republic of Korea was established today. President Syngman Rhee delivered a speech stating: Today, Korea has achieved independence, the culmination of forty years of Korean hope, dreams, struggle, and sacrifice. The Korean government hopes to maintain and promote the current friendly relations with all relevant countries, and even more hopes to establish friendly relations with governments with whom there has been no contact. The Chinese government temporarily recognized the Korean government on August 12th and therefore reiterates the close friendly relations between the two countries. For hundreds of years, the restoration of positive amity between China and Korea lies in this. The Soviet Union is our neighbor, and we wish to live peacefully and amicably with this great nation. We only ask that the Soviet Union allow us to live freely, and we ourselves hope that the Soviet Union will be able to do so as well. Once the Soviet Union has this intention, Korea will extend a hand of friendship. Rhee said: Today should be a day of national celebration, but looking towards the north, one cannot help but feel worried. The Korean people first appeal to the sense of justice of the Soviet people, and then to the conscience of the world, that is, all countries in the world, in order to maintain lasting peace, no matter how powerful a country is, it must not forcibly occupy the territory of its weaker neighbors. The establishment of Korea has six major principles: (1) absolute faith in democracy; (2) protection of the freedom of ordinary people, special classes, and individuals; (3) respect and protection of freedom, and grasp of its inherent value; (4) tolerance and cooperation as the way to govern the country; (5) determination to do everything possible to improve the living conditions of the poor; (6) the need for foreign economic assistance. Rhee went on to warn Koreans who were dissatisfied with the status quo, whether communists or not, that they must not overthrow the government. He said: The Korean people enjoy many freedoms and rights, but they do not have the right to subvert or attempt to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 15th] US military commander in Korea, Hodge, recently announced that the US military government in Korea will cease to exist from the 15th. A Civil Affairs Bureau will be established within the US military headquarters in Korea to transfer important control rights to the new Korean government, and during the transition period, to execute the remaining functions of the military government. Hodge's statement was made in a speech celebrating the establishment of the Korean government. Hodge also promised that the United States will do its best to help stabilize the Korean government until it can adapt to internal and external affairs.</p>
<p>My Representative Liu Yuwan Delivers Congratulatory Remarks [Central News Agency, Seoul, 15th] The Australian representative of the United Nations delegation to Korea, Jamieson, opposed the delegation negotiating with the new Korean government on various outstanding issues on the grounds that the Korean government could only represent two-thirds of the Korean people. Today he left for Tokyo. All representatives except Jamieson attended the celebration ceremony for the establishment of the Korean government this morning. Representing our country at today's grand event were Liu Yuwan, our ambassadorial diplomatic representative to Korea, and Situ De and Wang Gongxing, our deputy representatives to the United Nations delegation to Korea. Liu delivered a short congratulatory speech.</p>

He said: It is with heartfelt joy that I am able to visit Korean soil and witness the rebirth of freedom and independence at this historic moment. He added: But at this time, the victory of the Korean people is simply clouded by a major tragedy in modern history, that is, the artificial barrier that separates your country into two.</p>
<p>MacArthur said: He knows that Korea will never succumb to any foreign evil forces.

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The United States today rejected the third protest filed by the Soviet Union regarding the Gouzenko incident. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin and US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett, during a lengthy discussion, protested the violation of the extraterritorial rights of the Soviet consulate in New York by US police, because the latter had sent Gouzenko, who jumped from the fourth floor to escape imprisonment, to the hospital. Lovett only allowed for official information to be sought on this point. The Soviet ambassador made three demands today: (1) Soviet guards should guard the hospital day and night; (2) Gouzenko should be transferred from the hospital to a place controlled by the Soviet Union; (3) police should be instructed not to interfere with the duties of Soviet Consul General Lomakin and should be allowed to visit the hospital. Lovett firmly rejected this request.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] New York senators on the 14th requested the federal government to ensure that all officials and attendants at the Soviet Consulate General in New York City are not allowed to leave the United States until the authorities decide whether the Gouzenko case contains criminal acts. Shortly after Congressman O'Boyle subpoenaed him to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he telegraphed Secretary of State Marshall, requesting that Marshall not allow consulate officials to leave the United States until "the authorities of New York City, New York State, and the Department of Justice have determined whether Soviet Consul General Lomakin and his subordinates have committed criminal acts in the Gouzenko case."</p>

<p>Many Contradictions After Confrontation</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Investigators in the House of Representatives on the communist espionage case said on the 14th that half of the Soviet espionage organization case depends on one person, the questionable meaning of the word, "and we don't know who is lying," the editor of the grade, who had joined the Communist Party and has since confessed. Zhang told the Congressional Committee about the work of underground communists among Federal government personnel in Washington before 1937. The other half of the case depends on the testimony of Miss Bentley, who said that she was the transmitter of this espionage organization during the war. Zhang swore an oath in the House Un-American Activities Committee and pointed out that Hiss was one of the mainstays of this item. Hiss was formerly a State Department official and made great contributions to the founding of the United Nations. Hiss also swore an oath in the Talk Committee, denying each point of Zhang's accusation. He stated clearly that he did not know Zhang Bosi, "As far as I know, I have never seen this person." Investigators who did not want to disclose their names made it clear that they were having difficulty with contradictory testimony.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Stalin's Successor: Still a Major Secret <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— By Middleton</p>
<p>Differing Circumstances from Past to Present</p>
<p>Zhdanov's power within the Party was such that some political figures in the Soviet Union, recalling Stalin's rise to power, considered him to be the most favored successor. However, since Stalin succeeded Lenin and eliminated Trotsky, the situation has changed. In the past, the Communist Party was the only powerful group in this young nation. Today, although this group's strength remains substantial, it is countered by security agencies and governmental factions comprising bureaucrats and the military.</p>
<p>For example, Beria can boast of twenty divisions of state secret troops and numerous plainclothes agents, but the question remains: are these individuals loyal to their organization and its leaders, or to the Party?</p>
<p>Marshal Bulganin can tout the accomplishments of the army in World War II, an army that envies the Communist Party and security agencies. However, the latter two have merged since the war to limit the power of wartime generals and weaken their influence in the government.</p>
<p>Recently, the power of the government faction has greatly increased. It includes not only general ministries like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, but also penetrates other major industrial sectors. As a result, its influence extends beyond administrative personnel to include technicians, engineers, and experts who can be called upon for economic planning. It seems that the importance of national planning is even greater than that of the military, the Party, and the security agencies. The expansion of all three groups—the military, the government, and security—has created a situation where, although the Party fostered their growth, they are no longer controlled by it.</p>
<p>Fortune Changes Constantly</p>
<p>Currently, various factions vying for the leadership position held by Stalin maintain a precarious balance. Within the atmosphere of the Kremlin in this empire, the competition for dominance ebbs and flows. Meanwhile, Stalin remains aloof and above it all.</p>
<p>Although Stalin's work in Moscow is said to be as lengthy and arduous as in the past, it is said that he participates less in the debates of the Politburo. He merely listens to each person's statements and, finally, concludes with very few words.</p>
<p>He seems more humane and approachable than Molotov. This leads Westerners to believe that everything might progress more if they could negotiate directly with Stalin.</p>
<p>In the past, no one had such authority. When the Soviet Union was under pressure, Stalin could make the necessary concessions; only he could do so without criticism. But when devoted to the doctrines of Communism, he was as ruthless and steadfast as Molotov.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, Stalin is a semi-deified figure. He is the hero of poems and stories, and the exaggerated praise for him would make even the despotic emperors of Persia blush with shame. His portrait hangs in the tents of Mongolian cavalrymen, on the walls of apartment buildings in Leningrad, and in the farmhouses of Ukrainian peasants.</p>
<p>"Odes" in Poetry</p>
<p>The hanging pictures vary with the setting. In the ethnically diverse Soviet Union, each ethnic group views Stalin as its own idol. Thus, when Kazakhs hang huge portraits at art exhibitions, it is easy to see that the leader's traits are imbued with many Kazakh characteristics. The banners of the Central Asian republics read: "The odes of all the tribes contain the name of Stalin." The speeches of representatives in front of the Supreme Soviet always include the mystical syllables of Stalin's name.</p>
<p>Countless Soviet people believe that Stalin is the most intelligent and omnipotent; he is the creator of victory, the engineer of the new Russia, the maker and interpreter of doctrine, and the father of all Soviet people. His death will leave not only a power vacuum but also a vacuum of idol worship.</p>
<p>The main problem of succession is whether the question of succession can be decided secretly by the Congress. If this is possible, superficial unity can be maintained; otherwise, unity will be broken. Stalin could solve the succession problem in two days by appointing one person as his successor to continue in the most important positions currently held. Otherwise, he will leave the great power of the government to the four-cornered competition of Molotov, Zhdanov, Beria, and Bulganin.</p>
<p>Conflict is Inevitable</p>
<p>Looking at the political power at stake, the struggle to seize this power seems unavoidable. However, this struggle does not necessarily have to wait until Stalin's death; it may erupt within this group of ministers. This struggle, which has been instilled into all Party members for thirty years, may be applied in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>If this struggle does not occur, the new situation will inevitably endanger the future economy of the Soviet Union and its position in the world. In the Soviet Union, no institution can change the Soviet government or simultaneously satisfy two or three opposing groups. If it worsens, the struggle for power may escalate into a civil war, eventually derailing the country's economy and social life.</p>
<p>In the midst of a nationwide struggle, Beria, who controls the security agencies, has the most favorable prospects. If decided by Congress, then Molotov and Zhdanov would be the most prominent candidates. (To be continued)</p>

<p>No Detention at the Time</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 15th] Soviet newspapers on the 15th made no mention of the development of American espionage against communist spies, but reported that several months ago, the American military attaché in the Soviet Union was caught red-handed engaging in sabotage and expelled from the country. The report stated that American attaché Lieutenant Tracy Hall obtained "secret" information from a Soviet customs official, but "the two were discovered on April 23 by senior customs officials and security officers, both looking horrified. They were interrogated, and notebooks and documents in English and Russian were found. At that time, one of the unidentified persons suddenly attacked a security officer, attempting to seize the documents, but failed. The notebooks contained extremely secret information, and the unidentified person was Tracy Hall." Hall directly admitted to obtaining information from the customs official, and the customs official confirmed his statement. The Soviet side then requested the American embassy to immediately expel Hall back to his home country, which the American embassy quickly complied with, without saying a word about the crime. The American embassy acknowledged on the 15th that Hall had worked here.</p>

<h3 id="e62">City's Financial Situation Extremely Difficult; Employee Subsidies Exceed 2 Trillion; Efforts to Make Up for Deficit <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The city's finances are currently experiencing extreme difficulties. A person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau announced yesterday that the monthly living subsidy will be calculated at 1.6 million times the base amount, totaling over 2.5 trillion yuan. Despite the extreme financial difficulties, it has been decided to start issuing the subsidy on the 17th of this month. However, there is a significant shortfall in the current tax revenue needed to cover this expenditure. The deficit will be made up through other means, with three sources: (1) Taxes due for the current month or quarter will be strictly enforced for payment. In addition, taxes collected on behalf of the city by other agencies, such as dock duties, have been notified to be paid in advance. (2) The collection of the municipal construction surtax on public utilities for the current month will be expedited, and the payment of arrears will be ordered. (3) Although the above two measures can cover most of the deficit, the remaining shortfall of at least 500-600 billion yuan will be temporarily borrowed to make up the difference. The person in charge also stated that no matter how difficult the city's finances are, the financial authorities will do everything possible to ensure that municipal funds are disbursed in a timely manner. However, the fundamental solution lies in thorough reorganization and the establishment of an autonomous financial system, which is currently under careful study.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A dismissal dispute recently occurred at the Da Zhonghua Cigarette Factory on Weihaiwei Road. It began when Liu Guiying, a female worker in the tobacco leaf department of the factory, was elected as a preparatory member when the factory's workers participated in the organization of the Municipal Cigarette Workers' Union. After the Municipal Cigarette Workers' Union was officially established on the 12th of this month, the factory suddenly dismissed Liu on the grounds that her leaf cutting did not comply with regulations. Upon hearing this news, the factory workers felt deeply dissatisfied and submitted a petition to the Municipal Cigarette Workers' Welfare Committee yesterday, requesting the committee to send personnel to mediate the matter so that Liu could resume her work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Handling Increased Capital of Traitorous Stocks: Clearing Office Decides on Four Principles <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>According to information from the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office, the number of stocks received and seized from various traitors by the office is extremely large, categorized by type. At a time when the currency is depreciating daily, the companies to which these stocks belong are all applying to the Ministry of Finance for approval to increase their capital. The companies are paying close attention to the issue of increasing the capital of the stocks seized from various traitors, fearing that improper handling may lead to future disputes. After careful discussion, the Clearing Office has recently decided on several principles: (1) In principle, the right to increase the value of traitorous shares in various enterprises should be retained. However, if the total value of traitorous shares is less than 20% of the total paid-up capital of the enterprise, and the amount of increased capital to be paid is more than 5 million yuan, in addition to using all the previous period's dividends and interest due to the traitorous shares to pay for the increased capital, the shortfall should be forfeited to avoid reducing the income from traitorous assets and increasing the burden on the national treasury. (2) If traitorous shares account for more than 20% of the total paid-up capital of various enterprises, and the business situation of the enterprise is good, the office may pay for the increased capital shares in proportion to the original shares of the traitorous shares. (3) Stocks or increased shares of various enterprises will be obtained in accordance with the methods decided by the shareholders' meeting of the enterprise. (4) If traitorous shares account for less than 20% of the total paid-up capital of various enterprises, and the amount of increased capital to be paid is less than 5 million yuan, and the business situation is not good, the amount of the previous period's dividends and interest due to the traitorous shares may be used to pay for the new shares, and the shortfall shall be raised jointly by the enterprise and external sources.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Mr. Xu Maotang's Family Has a Goose with Special Intelligence: Greets Guests, Welcomes the Host, Protects Chickens, Chases Away Cats; Unruly, Only Afraid of the Cook <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Among small animals, cats and dogs are known to possess special intelligence, but it is rare to see chickens and geese that are different from the ordinary. The family of Mr. Xu Maotang, the general manager of the Zhonghui Bank in this city (wrongly identified as Xu Guomao in the "Gems of Chinese Literature" picture in the previous issue of this newspaper), has a goose that is completely different in disposition from ordinary poultry. Mr. Xu purchased the goose from the countryside seven years ago. At the time of purchase, there were a total of four, but the other three died one after another shortly after, leaving this goose alone. Subsequently, after a long period of solitary life, it seemed unwilling to submit and gradually encroached on the duties of the cats and dogs in the Xu family. When a guest arrives, it immediately raises its head and crows loudly. When Mr. Xu returns home from outside, it also follows closely, swaying and pursuing. If the Xu family's servants or friends leave food in the kitchen, it will jump and peck, obstructing them in every way. Although there are many cats and dogs in the Xu family, they know that they are no match for its immense strength, so they can only do nothing. This year, the goose became extremely intimate with a rooster raised by Mr. Xu. When Mr. Xu hatched several chicks in March and April, the goose took on the demeanor of a family elder, always tasting the food itself before the chicks. After the chicks finished eating, it would then eat the leftovers. If it saw a stray cat prowling around, it would fight bravely and defend the chicken flock. In the morning and evening, when the group of chickens and chicks entered and left the nest, it would always supervise from the rear, driving them one by one with its long neck to the ground, ensuring that the rooster and chicks acted uniformly under its command before it would stop. This goose is usually quite unruly, but when it sees the Xu family's cook appear, it immediately bows its head and dares not move. When asked, the servants of the Xu family all said: "Perhaps the chief cook has a bit of a murderous aura!"</p>

<p>After the Municipal Council's Provisional Assembly decided to reduce the new prices of public utilities for August, Mayor Wu is scheduled to convene a meeting with the heads of various companies at the City Hall's meeting room at 3:00 PM this afternoon to persuade them to accept the price reduction plan. Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council will also be invited to attend.</p>
<p>Furthermore, various Chinese companies such as Zhabei Water and Electricity, Huashang Electric, and Pudong Water and Electricity, because the American-owned Shanghai Power Company actually supplies 87% of the electricity in various districts, all take their cue from the Shanghai Power Company on the issue of reducing the new prices. The attitude of the Shanghai Power Company will depend on the decision of the company's general manager, Huo Pusijin, after he rushes back here from Qingdao. Huo arrived in Shanghai yesterday. All companies will hold a joint meeting this morning to exchange views in preparation for the mayor's persuasion meeting on price reductions this afternoon.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Government Statistics Office has completed the compilation of the cost of living index for the first half of August in this city and released it yesterday. The total index for workers is 3.63 million times, an increase of 1.77 million times compared to the second half of July. The total index for staff is 2.87 million times, an increase of 1.37 million times compared to the second half of July. The classified indices for workers and staff are recorded below:</p>
<p>Workers</p>
<p>Food: 3,720,000 times</p>
<p>Clothing: 7,900,000 times</p>

<p>Housing: 770,000 times</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: 2,990,000 times</p>
<p>Review Committee Members Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cost of Living Index Review Committee held its 16th meeting at the Municipal Government at 9:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Zongmeng, Director of Statistics for the Municipal Government, reported on the price increases: the price situation was relatively stable in the first three periods, but the last period saw a more dramatic increase. Items with increases below 30% include bean curd sheets, salt, tea, matches, soap, and straw paper. Items with increases between 31% and 40% include soybeans, flannel, soy sauce, and "士林" cloth. Items with increases between 41% and 50% include bean sprouts, coarse cloth, fine cloth, "花標" cloth, woolen cloth, thread, flour, pork, beef, and greens. Items with increases between 51% and 60% include cabbage and bleached cloth. Items with increases between 61% and 70% include indica rice and rapeseed. Items with increases between 71% and 80% include corn and firewood. Items with increases between 91% and 100% include haircuts and cigarettes. Items with increases above 100% include rationed sugar, rationed rice, electricity, and trams. After careful review by the committee members, they expressed satisfaction, signed the index forms, and adjourned the meeting at 10:40 AM.</p>
<p>Dramatic Rise in a Few Prices Has Little Impact on Index</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Zongmeng told reporters after the meeting: Some people outside are speculating on the overall index based on the prices of a few items, but this view is actually wrong. The worker index includes about 50 items, and the staff index includes about 90 items. If the prices of three or five items rise sharply while the prices of other items remain stable, the average figure will have little impact on the index. For example, in public utilities, only water, electricity, and transportation affect the index. Although gas and telephone rates have risen sharply, they are not included in the index calculation.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The American military authorities in this city have recently received notification from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the identification of genuine and fake American currency. For $20 bills, in addition to the paper, printing, and patterns being completely identical to the genuine ones, the only difference lies in the word "States" under the signature of the Treasurer of the United States on the lower left corner of the front. The first "t" in "States" is missing a stroke, forming an "i". Besides the $20 bill, there is also a $50 bill. In addition to being completely identical to the genuine one, the only flaw is that there is a missing dot at the front end of the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Luo Yingju, a 21-year-old Cantonese man from Xiamen Road No. 63, who made a living by scalping silver dollars, was on Huangpi North Road when he was approached by Liu Miaofa (25 years old, a laborer, residing at Xinping Lane No. 11 and a half, Longmen Road). Liu, who was drunk, asked Luo about the market price of silver dollars that day. Luo replied that they were selling for 710 "葛元" per dollar. Liu argued that the price was too high, and a conflict ensued, leading to a fight. Liu was no match for Luo and tried to escape, but Luo pursued him relentlessly. When they reached the intersection of Huangpi North Road and Jiangyin Road, Luo finally caught up with Liu and the fight resumed. Unexpectedly, Luo struck Liu in a vital spot with a punch, and Liu immediately fell to the ground and died. The assailant was apprehended by nearby street police and taken to the New City Police Station for punishment.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Mei Lin Canned Food Factory in this city hosted newspaper reporters yesterday to visit the factory on Hongqiao Road.</p>
<p>Canned foods, before and after the war, due to the large-scale import of various canned rations for the U.S. military, left a deep impression on people. However, the canned food manufacturing industry is still a rare phenomenon in our country. Before the war, there was the Taifeng Company, but its business failed and is no longer heard of. Today, the only canned food manufacturing factory in our country that is somewhat large-scale is Mei Lin.</p>
<p>A canned food manufacturing factory is like a large kitchen for society. After various foods are processed, it not only makes it convenient for diners to enjoy them without cooking, but also extends the life of seasonal foods and expands the scope of regional food flavors. There is nothing particularly noteworthy about the manufacturing process. Mei Lin produces meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, etc. These foods are flavored and boiled in large stainless steel pots, then sealed in cans. When sealing the cans, the can lid is fused to the can opening with a rubber band under high heat generated by a high-pressure machine. Then, it is placed in a steamer to heat, causing the air inside the can to expand and escape through the micropores of the rubber. After taking it out and cooling, it can be stored for a long time.</p>
<p>Mei Lin was founded in January 1933, purchasing dozens of acres of land on Hongqiao Road to build its own factory buildings and purchasing steamers, sorters, can-making machines, etc. from abroad. The scale was roughly established, but unfortunately, it has been greatly hindered by the war and the general situation after the war in recent years. The factory currently has over a hundred workers. In addition to canned foods, it also produces tomato sauce, chili sauce, soda, etc.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the factory's products began to be exported to Southeast Asia and the Americas starting in 1939. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the concessions were occupied, the food needed by the British and American foreigners in the camps was supplied by the company. After the war, the overseas market recovered, and the company's products were exported in large quantities. Water chestnuts, green peas, and loquats are very popular in the Americas. In 1948, it earned over US$70,000 in foreign exchange. In order to manufacture tomato sauce and canned green peas, the factory specially purchased seeds from the United States and distributed them to farmers in the Hongqiao area to plant, and then the factory purchased them. This not only promotes domestic production but also benefits rural areas. In addition to the main factory on Hongqiao Road, there are branch factories in Tanglou and Chongming. The former specializes in producing loquats, cherries, and braised bamboo shoots, while the latter packages anchovies and jade fish. Recently, it is also planning to establish a branch factory in Taiwan, specializing in the production of local specialty vegetables and pineapples for export to the Americas. In 1946, the factory sent an engineer to the United States to study can-making technology, and he will soon complete his studies and return to China. With continued efforts to improve, it may create a new brilliance for China's canned food manufacturing industry.</p>

<h3 id="e88">High Salt Prices Affect People's Livelihood, Merchants Hope for Loans for Transportation and Sales <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Salt Loan Syndicate was ordered to suspend operations, the funding for transporters was disrupted, indirectly affecting salt prices. Currently, the wholesale price of Zhejiang-Shanghai salt has reached over 9 million yuan per bundle, and in the Xubu area, it has even reached over 15 million yuan. If measures are not taken to improve the situation, it will have a huge impact on people's livelihood. Some believe that the rise in salt prices is a natural trend of general price fluctuations, especially due to the sharp increase in transportation costs and the rising cost of hemp bags. However, according to people close to the transporters, the actual factors are not entirely the case. The rise in salt prices is actually closely related to the suspension of the loan syndicate. Looking back at the past two years, the China Bank's leadership in the salt loan syndicate was relatively smooth. The method used was to provide loans based on pledges, with the amount of the loan determined by the quantity of goods transported. The interests of all borrowers were equal, with no distinction between old and new, large and small. After the suspension, transporters with sufficient funds can continue to operate as before and can use other means to obtain other loans, while smaller ones are stretched thin and are inevitably eliminated. The result is: (1) a shortage of wholesale salt in the sales areas, leading to rising prices, threatening both military and civilian supplies. (2) Stagnation in the production areas, with funds unable to circulate, affecting reproduction, making life difficult for salt workers, and reducing tax revenue. (3) In production areas adjacent to bandit areas, the security of materials is a concern. In order to encourage salt production, the Four Joint Office approved a total of 1.3 trillion yuan in salt production loans under the national policy loan program this spring, to be underwritten by the National Bank as a transfer pledge. The program, which was previously concentrated in Shanghai, was transferred to Zhejiang, Fujian, Qingdao, etc. due to the cancellation of the syndicate, with the Bank of China designated as the representative bank for the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian regions, and the Bank of Communications as the representative bank for the Qingdao region. However, current costs have increased again, and the loan amount has not been adjusted, which is far from the actual situation. As for transportation and sales loans, since the end of the syndicate last month, each bank has handled them as business loans, providing discretionary amounts, but the transfer pledge procedure has not yet been agreed upon, and the amount of loans disbursed so far is small. It is also learned that the National Bank's Discount Committee passed a resolution on the 9th of this month regarding the Salt Affairs Bureau's allocation and transportation of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan salt, as well as Xubu Huai salt transportation and sales transfer pledges, to be negotiated by the bank's business bureau with various banks to determine the loan amount and method. With the peak season for transportation and sales approaching and a lack of funds, transporters generally hope that this method will be implemented quickly.</p>

<p>A tragic suicide by poisoning occurred in Room 420 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road a few days ago. Bi Yongchang, a Ningbo native who worked as an industrial raw material broker, died on the spot. The police station in charge has sent the body to the Changde Road Morgue for examination yesterday. Bi Yongchang, 31 years old, was engaged in the business of industrial raw materials. Bi had a wife and a concubine. In June of this year, Bi sold 200 bags of table salt in a transaction, paying out 160 bags at the time and owing 40 bags. Recently, due to rising prices, he was unable to deliver the goods and went into hiding at the Hexing Inn No. 80, Zhongzheng East Road. He was eventually found by the buyer, who demanded that he pay the owed goods. Bi, forced into a corner, had a sudden thought and sneaked into the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road a few days ago and swallowed poison to commit suicide.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Chen Afu, a local, lived with his wife and daughter in a shack at No. 40, West Gate Road, Longhua Town Aircraft Field. Chen was unemployed, relying on his wife and daughter to do laundry for others to make a living. His daughter, Sanmei, who was already 18 years old, had a relationship with Zhu Jinfa, a traffic police officer from the nearby Traffic Police Brigade, due to her laundry work. Zhu also tried his best to introduce laundry work to her, so Chen's wife and daughter were quite busy. However, when Chen Sanmei delivered laundry, she developed a good impression of other traffic police officers, and Zhu inevitably showed jealousy in his words and expressions. He took the opportunity to steal a photo of Chen's daughter, intending to use it against her. Unexpectedly, Chen's daughter found out and insisted on returning it. Zhu left in anger. At around 4:00 AM the morning before last, Chen and his wife were fast asleep when they suddenly heard their daughter scream in her room. They rushed inside and saw that their daughter was lying stiff in a pool of blood, already dead. Upon examination, there were several knife marks on her throat, but the doors and windows were closed as usual. The assailant must have entered and exited through the window. They reported it to the Longzeng Police Sub-bureau in charge. Based on the previous situation, they went to the Traffic Police Brigade to summon the suspect, Zhu Jinfa, but Zhu had not been seen for two days and had probably fled out of guilt.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Hangzhou Paradise in the Midst of Rising Prices <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 14th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>As the heat wave of the "autumn tiger" comes, the rising prices of Hangzhou follow. Flour, vegetables, pork, and eggs have all risen sharply, increasing by as much as 80% in two days. The small people are at a loss as to what to do. Some poor civil servants rush to buy silver dollars when they receive their salaries and then exchange the silver dollars for banknotes when they need money, because any savings cannot withstand the jump in prices. Banknotes are losing value every day. Therefore, Qingtai Road, where the most silver shops are located in Hangzhou, especially the Tangzi Lane and Zhubao Lane near the large silver shops near Qingtai Road Lujiao, is filled with the incessant "kakadangdang" sound of hammering silver dollars, forming a sound that threatens people's nerves. If you approach them, they will ask if you want "large head" or "small head"? Do you want gold? In every newspaper in Hangzhou, in addition to the market price of gold, there is also the price of "black gold," which is about 10% cheaper than the price of gold in shops.</p>
<p>Compared to the financial market in Shanghai, Hangzhou is naturally not comparable. Shanghai is already talking about US dollars, while Hangzhou is still talking about silver dollars and gold. However, every gold and dollar tycoon in Shanghai is thinking about how to concentrate wealth in himself, while most people in Hangzhou only buy and sell silver dollars because they have no other choice. Of course, there are many rich people in Hangzhou, and they also do gold and dollar business, hoarding goods, and even taking advantage of low prices to buy the people's necessary food in the name of the public, and then saying that low grain prices hurt farmers and demand high prices, such as in this era of chaotic prices, when early rice has already been harvested and threshed, we have seen large quantities of grain being transported out in counties that produce grain, but the price of rice has not fallen but is still frighteningly high. Although legal tender is depreciating and other prices are soaring, rice is still the mainstay of all goods, and with its value multiplied a hundredfold, other goods are even more crazy. The most pitiful are the farmers in the countryside. They work hard all year round, and most of their harvest is distributed by donations, apportionments, and taxes, and all they get is legal tender that is depreciating every day.</p>
<p>This summer, there has been very little rain in Hangzhou. After autumn, there is still a general drought. We cannot help but think of this group of good farmers who work tirelessly. They water the fields day and night, and even if their hands and feet are blistered and their skin is tanned "soy sauce", they still work non-stop. How much work have we people who are enjoying life today, especially the people in the officialdom, done for them? How many sufferings have we solved? Their watering tools are still the old set from more than a hundred years ago, and their methods of cultivating the fields are also old and outdated. The people who enjoy life have forgotten them. Has the government also forgotten them?</p>
<p>The autumn harvest is coming soon. How often do we think about how the autumn harvest will be this year? How to comfort the hard work of the farmers? People in the city have recently been somersaulting in "money" and cannot think of these things at all.</p>
<p>Under the high pressure of prices, the farmers see that their hard-earned harvest cannot sustain their food and clothing, and they may flee the countryside in large numbers to engage in other occupations. If this is the case, if this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, the private prostitution that was once banned has recently become more active on Yingshi Street. In the past, they were middle-aged women who seemed to be skilled in this business. Now, some young girls, as if they had just come from the countryside, are shyly soliciting customers.</p>
<p>The number of unemployed people is also gradually increasing, and people are coming and going, all looking for jobs. Some fail to find jobs and have suicidal thoughts. Some fail to find jobs and eat a free meal in a restaurant. The number of beggars is also gradually increasing, and almost every household has a beggar at its door. The newspapers in Hangzhou often carry news of suicides and murders, and most of these suicide news are related to unemployment and promiscuity.</p>
<p>Of course, most of the responsibility for the above situations lies in the skyrocketing prices and depreciation of legal tender. The government's countermeasures for dealing with this matter seem to be only focusing on tightening the money supply. After the money supply is tightened, the banks naturally feel the pain of not being able to balance their accounts. Therefore, each bank issues a type of banker's draft. It is said that this banker's draft can also be used to buy goods and can also be deposited in the bank. Then the government's so-called tightening of the money supply is still useless. Recently, banker's drafts are flying everywhere in the city of Hangzhou, and prices are still rising continuously.</p>
<p>Although Hangzhou has the beauty of West Lake, thousands of citizens are shocked by the prices. They are no longer in the mood to admire this beautiful lake and mountains, so the summer night business of the rowboats is not good, and every night garden has lost money. Some scenic areas where people can cool off do not have many visitors.</p>
<p>At the turn of summer and autumn, Hangzhou has only become a transit point for people escaping the heat. People going to Mount Mogan must pass through Hangzhou, and people going to Guling must also pass through Hangzhou because there have been no planes recently, and they have to take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi train to Nanchang, Jiujiang, and reach the foot of Mount Lu.</p>
<p>The only hope of the people of Hangzhou is that the hot summer will pass quickly, and the autumn tiger, which is almost as hot as summer, will also pass quickly, followed by clear autumn weather. The Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, the red leaves on Jade Emperor Mountain will bloom, the Osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong will spread their fragrance, and the trees around the lake will deepen their greenness. At that time, tourists from Beijing and Shanghai will increase again, and the shops in Hangzhou will be able to earn a sum of money. The shops in Hangzhou think so, and the monks and Taoists in Hangzhou also think so. Vendors, rickshaw pullers, tricycle pullers, and car dealerships all think so, but do the vast majority of people in Hangzhou who rely on salaries have the leisure to think so?</p>
<h3 id="e100">National Defense Front Line: Mazong Mountain <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— By our reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou dispatch, 5th] Mazong Mountain is a remnant of the Tianshan Mountains, with an altitude of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 feet. It is located north of Anxi County and is the northernmost part of Gansu, bordering Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Ningxia, forming a triangular area of ​​more than 91,000 square kilometers. In medieval times, this was a fiercely contested area. The Xirong, Yuezhi, Xiongnu, Han, Western Xia, Mongol, and other ethnic groups shed blood here. During the Qing Dynasty, under the Qianlong Emperor, it was incorporated into Anxi Prefecture. Since the Republic of China, it has been under Anxi County. It is currently governed by the newly established Subei Administration Bureau.</p>
<p>Due to its strategic location, and following Outer Mongolia's "independence," it has become the foremost frontline for national defense in the Northwest. Therefore, upon arriving in Jiuquan, we discussed it with Mr. Wang Weiyong, the administrative commissioner of the Seventh District. According to Commissioner Wang, Mazong Mountain belongs to the Subei Administration Bureau, and the residents are all Mongolians, totaling less than 1,000 people. However, they do not reside on their land, instead residing in the Xihu and Bulongji areas between Anxi and Dunhuang. They are roughly divided into two tribes: one part of Qinghai, led by Gong Baoju, and one part of Xinjiang, led by National Assembly representative Sebulah. The Administration Bureau is also temporarily located in Sandaogou Town, Anxi, 400 li away from its people. The current director is Cao Kuiwen. Therefore, we are greatly interested in the Subei Administration Bureau, which is completely disconnected from its land, people, and government. Along the way, we inquired about the situation of Mazong Mountain from everyone we met. From conversations with Zhang, the battalion commander stationed there, Liao Fengyun, the brigade commander of the 191st Brigade, Huang Zuxun, the division commander of the 23rd Division, Zheng Zhuanghuai, the chief of staff, and the county magistrates of various counties, we have learned the general outline. Battalion Commander Zhang even advised us to go into the mountains for a look when we were in Anxi, but due to the inconvenience of transportation and the shortness of time, we declined his kind offer. Mazong Mountain is a desolate area. Only those who go to Irtysh to do business have yurts in the mountains. In the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), a small number of Mongolian people from Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang began to graze here. In the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918), the prohibition of opium was quite strict in Gansu Province, and more than 300 local ruffians sneaked into the Ike-gaol area of ​​Mazong Mountain to plant opium. Since this place was outside the law, the number of residents increased day by day.</p>
<p>Mongol-Kazakh Grievances Deepen</p>
<p>In the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), a young Outer Mongolian named White Camel Lama entered Mazong Mountain. He built a stone city and fortifications on the southern Xiaoshan Hill in Gongpoquan, wanting to compete with Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the leader of Outer Mongolia. By the 11th year (1922), the Han Chinese gradually moved elsewhere. At this time, Gongpoquan already had 30,000 to 40,000 head of livestock and 300 Mongolian yurts, all of whom were undergoing military training. Although our government did not inquire about it in order to calm things down, Outer Mongolia regarded it as a hidden danger. Therefore, in August of the 12th year (1923), Kulun sent assassins to assassinate the White Camel Lama. Three months later, more than 500 Mongolian cavalry were sent to raze Gongpoquan to the ground, and all the Mongolian people were killed or captured.</p>
<p>After the 13th year (1924), the Mongolian people gradually fled back. In the 17th year (1928), Kazakhs who fled from Zhenxi in Xinjiang entered the mountains and plundered and killed everywhere. The government immediately commissioned Baobula, the leader of the Mongolian people, to form a self-defense force to suppress them, and the Kazakh people fled elsewhere. At this time, there were more than 600 Mongolian yurts fleeing from Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Outer Mongolia. The Mongolian people who fled from Outer Mongolia, because of their hatred for the new regime in Outer Mongolia, went to Outer Mongolia from time to time to demonstrate. Finally, in the autumn of the 21st year (1932), the Outer Mongolian government sent 300 soldiers to suddenly attack Mazong Mountain, massacring more than 400 Mongolian people. The Kazakh people took the opportunity to come and attack again. The remaining Mongolian people fled to the Yuerhong area of the Qilian Mountains, and the remaining dozen or so Mongolian yurts later took refuge in Anxi and Dunhuang.</p>
<p>After the Xin-Sui Company's cars passed through this area in the 23rd year (1934), Anxi commissioned the head of the regiment, Zhang Bulin, to appease the refugees, set up tax checkpoints in the mountains to collect camel taxes and grass-head taxes, and the Mongolian people gradually returned. By the winter of the 24th year (1935), there were more than 100 yurts again. Following this, Kazakhs from Altay, Zhenxi, and other places in Xinjiang fled to Mazong Mountain one after another because they could not bear the oppression of the Xinjiang government. By the end of the 28th year (1939), there were more than 2,500 yurts and more than 12,000 people. These Kazakh people moved into Mazong Mountain originally to escape the arrest of the Xinjiang government, but later they began to rob and plunder, and the Mongolian people had to flee elsewhere again. At this time, the War of Resistance was in full swing. The government repeatedly tried to appease and suppress the Kazakh people. Since the 32nd year (1943), the Kazakh people have been restricted from moving into the Qilian Mountains, and the Mongolian people in this area have been merged into Mazong Mountain, with the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway as the boundary, and they are not allowed to infringe on each other. However, such a vast and desolate area cannot be prevented at all times, and the accumulated hatred between the Mongolian and Kazakh ethnic groups is getting deeper and deeper, and they often retaliate against each other. Now, except for the garrison, there are almost no inhabitants in Mazong Mountain.</p>
<p>Three Strongholds, National Army Garrisoned</p>
<p>We had no opportunity to visit the true face of Mazong Mountain, but we only heard people say that the northern part is full of Gobi and quicksand, while the southern part is interspersed with water and grass and sand mines. Distributed animal husbandry and cultivation are not absolutely impossible. Medicinal herbs and minerals are also very rich. At present, the three strongholds of Gongpoquan, Mingshui, and Malianjing in Mazong Mountain are all garrisoned by our army, so there is no need to worry about disturbances. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation, the soldiers stationed in the mountains cannot eat green vegetables more than twice a month, and they lack vitamins, so color blindness, leg swelling, and other diseases occur from time to time. Those who entrust hope that the supply aspect should be improved immediately, and at the same time, the contact aspect should be further strengthened.</p>
<p>In recent times, someone wrote a poem about Mazong Mountain. Reading it, one can imagine its terrain. The poem says: "Looking at the mountain on the flat sand is like seeing it in front of you, riding a camel and stepping on snow for another day. The peaks of Mazong Mountain are as long as snakes, and thousands of hills and ridges are connected to each other. I say this mountain has the danger of a tiger's back, but people call it Mazong. The yellow sand and black stones make one wonder if there is no road, but suddenly a hole opens up... Two mountains stand like walls on both sides of the main road, and mountains outside the mountains are like screens. The peaks are so steep on all sides that they seem like a line to the sky. How vast and obscure are the ancient dwellings... At night, we set up tents at the southern mouth of the mountain, and in the morning, the tea smoke is thick as we watch the sun rise..."</p>

<p>[Our Nanhui dispatch, 14th] Villagers in Lujiadi, Zhulangzhong Bridge, and other places in Zhaolou Township have recently been fooled into believing that bees bite flowers and harm crops.

<p>Wujin Deputy Mayor Indicted for Malfeasance</p>
<p>[Our Wujin dispatch, 14th] Wang Hong, a resident of Nan Zhai Town, is over fifty years old and a widow. She only has one son, Bai Geng, who is 22 years old. She once used dozens of packs of cigarettes to exchange for four exemption application forms from the town office, carefully filled them out and sent them, but received no response. Deputy Mayor Bian Yifei claimed that 15 shi of white rice must be paid to postpone conscription; 30 shi can be exempted forever. Wang could not afford it because of her poor family, so she sent her son to Beijing to join the training corps as a first-class soldier. Bian, failing in his extortion, accused Wang of being a drafted young man and repeatedly reported to the county to ask the training corps to send him back. At the same time, on April 6, Wang's mother was detained in the town office, and she was ordered to pay for a replacement or pay a fee. Then, on the grounds of resisting conscription, she was transferred to the district and sent to the county. After more than a month, she was released on bail. Recently, Wang Baigeng returned home to visit his relatives. After learning about this, the town office immediately sent soldiers to arrest Wang and send him to the district and then to the county. Wang's mother, accompanied by relatives, appealed to the county government. After investigation, it was confirmed that Wang was indeed an only son, and the claim that he had been drafted was unfounded. Bian Yifei is now avoiding being seen.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou dispatch, 14th] Colleagues from the Zhejiang Administrative Society in Hangzhou are deeply concerned that the people of the country are increasingly worried about national affairs, focusing on military affairs or concerned about the economy, but inevitably neglect political work. Therefore, after careful review by the fifth session of the members of the association, a text was drafted and a solemn appeal was issued, hoping that people of insight could pay more attention to political work and strive for progress and innovation from ordinary reality. The following are excerpts of the main points of the full text for reference by all sectors.</p>
<p>First, we are now suppressing the rebellion, so of course we must not create chaos again. We have now implemented the constitution, so of course we must not violate the constitution at will. It must be understood that violating the constitution is creating a source of chaos, and to put out the newly born source of chaos, we must abide by the constitution. All those who love chaos oppose the law, especially the constitution, because rule of law and turmoil have never coexisted. Therefore, we do not approve of any remarks or actions that overthrow, amend, change, shake, or violate the constitution. Second, the country's turmoil has reached its extreme. To save this situation, we can only implement the local system stipulated in the constitution as soon as possible. In other words, the past excessive centralization of the central government has made local governments unable to do anything. Can a county be an autonomous unit? The miracles of Wang Fenggang and Bi Tingfang in North China are that they can adapt to local conditions and do not necessarily have to be constrained by too trivial central laws and regulations. The three-level equalization system of the central, provincial, and county governments in the constitution was stipulated after repeated research by the Father of the Nation. It should be implemented quickly. In particular, the draft Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules should be formulated as soon as possible, and attention should be paid to being true to its name. It should only be general rules and not be too trivial, lest the provincial and county autonomy laws in the future have no content. To build a country today, we must first build a local government. There is absolutely no way that a person with weak limbs can support a congested head.</p>
<p>Third, the current people are extremely poor. The numbers for everyone's living expenses have increased, but the standard of living has decreased. In this low, unspeakably low life, there are still so many burdens. There are too many places where the current system of land tax, taxes, and conscription can be reformed. In all fairness, the people are not unwilling to bear the burden of the country, but innocent losses that are useless to the country and harmful to the people should be avoided.</p>
<p>Fourth, when it comes to the administration itself, it is nothing more than cutting down redundant agencies, increasing the salaries of public officials, implementing the civil service system, and increasing administrative efficiency. Everyone has said a lot about these words, and there is really no need to say more. Our meaning is that in terms of employment, Article 85 of the constitution stipulates that "those who have not passed the examination shall not be employed." As for institutions, in the past ten years or so, I don’t know how many have been established and abolished. We only hope that the country can set up more constructive institutions to accommodate people who really want to do things, so that they can do things. Reducing agencies, concentrating power, and naturally efficiency can be improved. Reducing agencies, saving expenses, and naturally salaries can be increased. Reducing agencies, not using many people, and naturally incompetent people cannot be promoted by luck. Reducing agencies, clarifying responsibilities, and naturally the people will no longer suffer innocent losses. At the same time, when cutting and merging agencies, it is necessary to immediately run more construction projects to absorb talent and increase social wealth.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Real Situation of the Besieged Jinan: The Military Crisis Has Passed - Economic Problems Deserve Attention <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Jinan dispatch] Since Chazhou, Jichang, Weixian, Taian, and Zouxian were abandoned, Jinan has become the most isolated city on the mainland battlefield. This besieged city currently has only one line in the air that can be connected to the outside world.</p>
<p>At this time, the bandits launched a nerve offensive against Jinan. On the one hand, they mobilized troops and generals, deliberately setting up suspicious formations, and transferred the main force of seven columns remaining in Shandong (that is, Chen Yi's 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, New 8th, and Bohai Columns). All of them were transferred to the periphery of Jinan in Taian, Feicheng, Fanjiazhen, Shibeijie, Longshan, Zhangqiu and other areas. On the other hand, they also extensively recruited civilians and built siege ladders in preparation for attacking the city. At the same time, the New China News Agency repeatedly claimed to capture Jinan, which aroused the hearts of the people in Jinan. On the 9th of this month (August), this feeling of unease can be said to have reached its climax. From the 10th onwards, on the one hand, due to the airborne arrival of strong national army troops in Jinan, on the other hand, the remaining seven bandit columns gathered outside Jinan, due to difficult supply, had to be forced to occupy Wenshang, Ningyang, Qufu, Loud and other areas on both sides of the Wen River for replenishment and training from the 4th of this month. At this point, a stone in the hearts of the 700,000 citizens of Jinan finally landed. The airline seats that had been registered until October of this year are no longer as crowded as in the past due to the easing of the situation. The Lu natives in Beijing, members of the National Assembly and supervisors, and fellow villagers once caused an unpleasant memory of disturbances at the Presidential Palace in order to demand that the government increase troops to ensure Jinan, which can be regarded as having been compensated.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the military crisis in Jinan has passed. The old airport in Zhangzhuang, near the Yellow River's south bank in the northwest suburb of Jinan, has seen its defense strengthened due to the arrival of reinforcements. Although the Jinan City Ring Railway is only planned and there is no hope of construction due to limited funding, the new airport that was added east of Qilu University in the southeast suburb of Jinan on the 18th of last month has been half completed under the unanimous efforts of all sectors of the city and will be fully completed by the end of this month. This new airport not only adds a new aerial outlet to the isolated island, but also adds a most powerful guarantee to the 700,000 lives in Jinan City. As for the interior of Jinan City, a large-scale movement to eliminate internal traitors is now underway. The Sui District Administrative Office and the Military Police Inspection Office have promulgated the "Household Registration Control Measures During Extraordinary Periods." Therefore, as long as the reinforcements can arrive in a timely manner when there is tension, Jinan will never become the second Kaifeng; similarly, as long as the "Household Registration Control Measures" can be implemented seriously, all underground organizations and lurking elements of the Communist bandits can be eliminated, and Jinan will naturally never become the second Yanzhou.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the biggest problem facing Jinan in the future is obviously not military but economic. Since July 27, the bandits have officially begun to adopt a blockade policy against Jinan. Except for the very few grains carried by hand, which are still allowed to enter the urban area to exchange for the materials needed by the bandits, all other materials transported by handcarts, large carts, and even horse carts and automobiles are prohibited from being imported. According to reliable estimates, the current grain reserves in Jinan City are only enough for three months. Due to the sharp decline in the purchasing power of citizens, donations and levies are coming one after another, making it overwhelming. Many shops have closed down one after another. Recently, even the largest shops on Weisi Road, the most prosperous two main roads in the city, have closed down one after another. The depression in the market has not only made the living standards of ordinary citizens increasingly low, but has also caused a series of disturbing events such as suicide and robbery. It has long been discovered among the citizens that they cannot afford even corn buns and are filling their hunger with bean cakes. This crisis can only be overcome by the government's efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e111">General Commodity Prices: Market Rumors Abound, Prices Advance Towards Peaks <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Last week, commodity prices, continuing the trend from the previous weekend, advanced steadily at high levels in the early and mid-week. From Friday onwards, there was another surge, with new market prices frequently emerging and often setting new records.</p>
<p>The general wholesale price index for last week was 6,658,248 times the base, an increase of 28.59% compared to the previous week. The market's credit situation was slightly tighter than the previous week, but the National Bank's clearing position showed a deficit of over 2 trillion on Monday and over 1 trillion on Thursday, so the situation cannot really be considered tight. Underground interest rates hovered around 4.5%.</p>
<p>Five million large denomination banknotes have not yet been issued, leading to a severe shortage of cash in the market, and the premium for cash is very common. At the same time, in order to cope with the difficulty of cash withdrawals, banks are issuing promissory notes for circulation in the market, estimated to amount to 50 trillion. This not only violates the principle of credit tightening by the Financial Control Bureau but also easily breeds other malpractices. The authorities should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Last week, due to the sharp contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate, general financial commodities were highly sought after. Decorative gold rose from 430 million to 470 million per tael on Monday to 540 million to 580 million at the weekend. Exchange certificates, with government support, also rose to a high price of 7.8 million.</p>
<p>Regarding the government's measures last week, the ones that have a relatively close impact on future commodity prices are as follows:</p>
<p>First, regarding the new economic reform plan, since the meeting in Mochinshan at the end of July, there have been many rumors. With the publication imminent, market prices are also somewhat shifting accordingly. It is reported that the content of the new plan involves stabilizing commodity prices, encouraging exports, attracting overseas Chinese investment, reforming the currency system, merging banks, and cooperating with US aid. However, the announcement has been delayed, with constant changes. Currently, central leaders are gathered in Lushan, and there will probably be important decisions. Frankly speaking, the severity of our country's current economic situation cannot be denied by anyone. The new plan should have a decisive effect on solving the current economic difficulties, and it should bear a great responsibility for the overall situation, whether good or bad, in the future.</p>
<p>Second, the ordinary part of this year's second half general budget was officially announced by the Presidential Office on the 12th, with total revenue and expenditure of 3,236,215,009,860,000 yuan. This budget only covers the ordinary part and does not include the special budget for military affairs. Everyone knows that the consumption of war is the root cause of the government's fiscal imbalance, so looking at this budget alone is not as significant as we imagine. Furthermore, based on past experience, the expenditure in the final month is almost equal to the expenditure for the entire year. With the accelerated rate of price increases and the expansion of the magnitude this year, we are not overly optimistic about the year-end final accounts.</p>
<p>Third, the issue of US aid's Counterpart Funds is receiving much attention from all parties recently, and there is a considerable gap in opinions between China and the United States. The total amount of US aid, excluding the military portion, is US$275 million. The original allocation was US$60 million for construction projects, US$70 million for food, US$70 million for cotton, US$50 million for petroleum, US$13.8 million for fertilizer, US$10 million for industrial parts, and US$1.2 million for administrative expenses. According to Mr. Lapham's announcement to trustees, the construction funds may be increased by another US$10 million, together with US$10 million for industrial parts, totaling US$80 million. In addition, it is said that the US$70 million of American cotton has been decided to be traded for goods, exchanging cotton for yarn, exporting the yarn, and then importing Indian cotton. From this, it can be seen that these two items, totaling US$150 million, already have specific uses and cannot be released into the domestic market to absorb currency, weakening the power of US aid. Today, our country's economic crisis is at a severe stage. We should consider how to overcome this immediate crisis before discussing construction and revitalization. Therefore, it is worth considering whether Mr. Lapham's suggestion will affect the plan to absorb currency.</p>
<p>Fourth, the case of selling state-owned enterprises has been going on for years without any implementation. Regarding the sale of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Association, recently stated, "At this time, some private shipping companies that are unable to maintain their operations are on the verge of bankruptcy and even hope that the government can acquire them and turn them into state-owned enterprises to relieve them of their heavy burdens and prevent continued losses. Therefore, if the government sells the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at this time, there are probably only two types of capital that can acquire it: foreign capital and powerful family capital. The former will spare no expense in seizing our country's shipping rights, and the latter, relying on special privileges, will naturally have no concerns. If the government rashly transfers our country's oldest and largest state-owned shipping organization to foreign capital or powerful family capital, the future of the shipping industry will be unimaginable." As for the sale of the China Textile Company, it is not difficult to imagine that it will face similar difficulties as the sale of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. How should the current financial situation, which is trapped in a dilemma, decide on this major measure?</p>
<p>Although the market price trend last week continued to rise and repeatedly set new prices amidst various rumors, this is probably because rumors are ultimately rumors, and the soundness of the economic situation itself has a decisive impact. Therefore, any economic plan that does not start from the root can only be effective for a while but is difficult to sustain in the long run.</p>
<p>In the yarn and cloth market, the market sentiment was most enthusiastic last week due to the strong bullish psychology. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 2.56 billion at the beginning of the week to 3.35 billion on Friday, and 21-count Double Horse rose from 1.95 billion at the beginning of the week to 2.55 billion at the beginning of the week. 120-count Sky Bridge silk also gradually rose from 2.82 billion at the beginning of the week to 3.59 billion on Friday. Under the frequent price increases in the producing areas, rice, except for special japonica approaching the 70 million mark, also broke through the 60 million mark, both setting unprecedented new prices. Oil and flour also followed suit, with a sharp rise. The price of a barrel of peanut oil approached 200 million at the weekend, and No. 1 Battleship flour broke through the 20 million mark. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes also increased significantly. On Friday, Guben soap reached over 86 million, Beauty matches rose to 400 million, and 500 Big Ben cigarettes reached 11.4 million. Other items such as chemicals, metals, and building materials also saw a surge in prices, creating new prices.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Currency and Finance <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>(1) Money Market and Underground Interest Rates</p>
<p>The money market in this city last week still showed an overall loose situation. Although the National Bank had a net inflow on three days of the week, the inflow was very small on the one hand, and the excess reserves were abundant on the other, so the impact on the market was very light. It is estimated that the accumulated floating capital in this city recently has reached over 100 trillion, and the authorities seem to have difficulty in handling this floating capital.</p>
<p>When inflation reaches a certain stage, the occurrence of a banknote shortage is inevitable. In other words, the rate of price increases today has already exceeded the rate of currency issuance. Although it is said that some of this is due to "artificial factors," the increase in the quantity of currency is the main cause, and the increased velocity of money circulation caused by people's disregard for currency is the consequence. This explains why the proposed new economic plan, although repeatedly revealing nerve warfare tactics such as strengthening control over banks, the money market has remained as loose as ever. The inevitable result of the easing of the money market is soaring prices, which is the reason for the general price increases last week.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the money market is loose, and on the other hand, there is a severe shortage of cash. Although it is said that the southward flow of large denomination banknotes is related to the banknote shortage in this city, according to news from the banking industry, the sealing dates of the cash funds received by the industry from the Central Bank are even the next day or the same day. This inevitably makes people wonder whether our banknote production capacity is sufficient to meet actual needs. From this, it is not difficult to see how serious inflation has become. Due to the lack of cash, the discount for large denomination banknotes in the market last week even reached one-tenth. At the same time, the Central Bank strictly limited the amount of cash withdrawals by the same industry, resulting in the widespread popularity of bank promissory notes. It is estimated that the average issuance of bank promissory notes per day is at least hundreds of billions and up to trillions, totaling 50 trillion. These promissory notes are not recovered on the same day, which makes the money market in the city even looser.</p>
<p>Underground interest rates were slightly higher on Monday and Tuesday, between 4.5 and 5.4%. On Wednesday, due to the easing of the money market, they fell to 3.9 and 4.2%. Abundant orders were frequently seen near noon. Although they rose again to 4.8% on Thursday due to increased demand, they ultimately fell to 3.9% again on Friday due to abundant supply. As for the interest rate on goods assistance, it was generally between 10 and 15 yuan per day, slightly higher on Thursday, at 18 and 20 yuan.</p>
<p>The results of the National Bank's clearing showed that although there were three days of net inflow from Monday to Friday, after deducting a portion of interbank fixed deposits on Tuesday and the deposits absorbed by the Bank of China on Wednesday, the National Bank actually disbursed 769.6 billion in five days. Although this was a decrease of more than 13 trillion compared to the previous week, because the excess reserves in the market were abundant, the National Bank's disbursement did not have any effect.</p>
<p>From Monday to Friday, foreign banks had a net inflow of 5,646.5 billion, a decrease of 167.04 billion compared to the same period in the previous week. According to investigations, most of this huge net inflow was the result of capital flight.</p>
<p>The funds of commercial banks were very loose. Abundant orders were frequently seen before Wednesday. Interbank lending was not done at all. After deducting the difference in Taiwan Bank's clearing, from Monday to Friday, the actual outflow of banks after No. 60 was only 255.61 billion, an increase of more than 790 billion compared to the same period in the previous week. The increase in demand can be generally seen. The end of price fatigue and the rise in prices can also be seen from this.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market fluctuated as follows last week: The Hong Kong Shanghai exchange rate contracted from 6 cents to 5 cents (100,000 legal currency) from Wednesday. The market price of Hong Kong US dollars fluctuated between 5.41 and 5.46 yuan. Gold was 332 Hong Kong dollars per Chinese tael on Monday, falling to 330.75 yuan on Thursday. The price of exchange certificates in this city was 6 million on Monday, and it had repeatedly risen to 7.3 million on Friday.</p>
<p>The listed price of decorative gold in silver shops was 470 million and 430 million on Monday. Afterwards, there were continuous price increases, with the selling price reaching 580 million and the buying price at 540 million at the weekend, an increase of more than 20%.</p>
<p>The domestic exchange rates of commercial banks last week generally increased once on Tuesday and then mostly maintained the high level of Tuesday until Friday. For example, the exchange rate of Guangzhou was 300 yuan on Monday and increased to 400 yuan from Tuesday, with no change until Friday; the exchange rate of Xiamen was 300 yuan on Monday and maintained at the level of 450 yuan from Tuesday to Friday; the exchange rate of Chongqing was 220 yuan on Monday, 250 yuan on Tuesday, 300 yuan on Wednesday and Thursday, and then increased to 350 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate of Wuhan was 180 yuan on Monday, raised to 200 yuan on Tuesday, and remained at 200 yuan until Friday. The exchange rate of Tianjin was at par before Wednesday, a discount of 20 yuan on Thursday, and the discount increased to 50 yuan on Friday, probably due to rumors that the Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate would be restricted.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the Chinese stock market opened due to the still strong rumors of the new economic reform plan, and there were many concerns about the unknown content. The short side was active, and the market was tired and hovering. Yong Yarn opened at 13,850 yuan and closed at 14,100 yuan. Other stocks showed mutual fluctuations, and the fluctuation range was not large, except for Lianhua, which was limit up.</p>
<p>The next day, due to reports that the announcement of the new economic reform plan would be delayed until the end of the month and the easing of the money market, commodity prices outside the market rose one after another, and the market sentiment turned from fatigue to firmness and suddenly became prosperous. A total of fifteen stocks, including Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinyi, Tongyi, Xinyi, China Fire, China Cement, Huaxin, Shanghai Cement, Yongye, Lianhua, Zhabei, China Xing, Merlin, and Datong, all reached limit up.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, due to the soaring prices of financial commodities and exchange certificates, the situation continued to be firm. Shui Yarn rose to close at 16,320 yuan, and Maya rose to close at 738 yuan. Among other stocks, except for Zhabei and Xinyi, which fell, all others rose.</p>
<p>Starting from Thursday, due to the continuous rise in prices and reaching a peak, the process gradually softened. Seven popular stocks such as Yong Yarn, Maya, Jingfu, China Silk, Huaxin, Lianan, and Guohuo fell, while the rest rose, and three stocks, including China Cement, Yongye, and China Xing, were limit up.</p>
<p>On Friday, due to the soaring prices of commodities outside the market and the silence of news about the new economic reform plan, the market sentiment was quite firm under the hype of the bulls. As a result, Yong Yarn closed at 17,050 yuan, an increase of 750 yuan compared to the previous day. Among other stocks, except for China Cement, which was limit down, and Hengfeng and China Porcelain, which fell, the rest rose, and six stocks, including Xinyi, China Steel, Huaxin, Yongye, Lianhua, and China Xing, were limit up.</p>
<p>At the weekend, due to various rumors and the softness of buyers' confidence, profit-taking and short-selling were active, and the market was tired and declining. Yong Yarn closed at 15,900 yuan, a sharp drop of 1,600 yuan compared to the high price of the previous day. Among other stocks, only Xinyi performed well, and the rest all fell.</p>
<h3 id="e113">China Trust Bureau Ordered More Than 10,000 Cases of Rayon from Italy <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon was not sold last week because the cargo ship ordered from Italy was delayed. It is now known that this batch of rayon, about 2,000 cases, is on its way to Shanghai and will arrive within this week. As soon as it arrives in Shanghai, the allocation will be restored.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the bureau, the total number of rayon ordered by the bureau from Italy is 11,000 cases, which are shipped to China in batches of about 1,600 to 1,700 cases each. The first batch arrived last month, and the goods currently being shipped to Shanghai are the second batch. Therefore, there will be no shortage of rayon needed by the domestic silk industry in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The World Games Successfully Concluded, Achieving Rich Harvests, Our Team Has Strived to the Best of Their Ability <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The various competitions of the World Games have been completed. It now seems possible to estimate their true significance. The reporter has been at the scene throughout the World Games and shares the same personal feelings and observations as most athletes, commentators, and observers: this London World Games has achieved great success not only in the field of sports technology, but also in expressing the ideals established when the World Games were founded 52 years ago. On the opening day of the Games, athletes and visitors at Wembley Stadium saw the words of Baron Coubertin, the founder of the modern World Games, short and meaningful, on an eight-foot-high scoreboard: "The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part; the important thing in life is not to conquer, but to struggle." If Coubertin were still alive, he would surely be pleased to see the spirit of the World Games, which is in line with his lofty ideals, expressed unreservedly in various competitions in this Games. Athletes of different colors and religions came to participate in various competitions and compete for championships. It is extremely easy for athletes to be in this tense atmosphere, mixed with the enthusiasm to win glory for the country, which can easily lead to unfortunate events that, on the surface, are destructive to harmony. However, in the two weeks of the World Games, apart from a few unimportant misunderstandings and referee errors, there have been no serious incidents of international disputes or expressions of resentment from a certain country at Wembley Stadium. Participants did strive in the true spirit of sports. Day after day, the audience watching the world's best athletes perform on the spot cheered for the winners, regardless of their nationality. This London World Games will undoubtedly be a peaceful vanguard ambassador between countries in a world tired of war. In terms of sports technology, it is heard that no previous modern World Games has had such amazing performances as this World Games. More than 20 track and field and other sports records have been broken, which is a great achievement. This is all that people can admire and envy. Compared with the countries participating in the competition, although our country did not win any championships, it did strive to the best of its ability. Our basketball team did have a remarkable performance. In the early round-robin elimination rounds, our team defeated Iraq with the highest score in basketball. Lou Wen'ao, our 10,000-meter runner, was the last person to complete the entire course after 13 other people, including the world record holder Hanno, dropped out midway. The audience was deeply moved by his good spirit and expressed enthusiastic cheers to him, no less than those shown to the champion Zatopek. In the 25-mile marathon, Lou Wen'ao once again mustered his courage and ran to second place at the five-mile mark and maintained sixth place at the halfway point, but had to withdraw due to severe pain from blisters on his feet. In the 1,000-meter cycling race, He Hao Hua, our country's only participant, was defeated by inches and collided with his opponent's car, resulting in a shoulder injury and being unable to participate in other cycling events. Such is fate. Our country, which has experienced years of war, only participated in the World Games with a basketball team, a football team, and a very small number of track and field athletes due to practical difficulties, not to win championships, but to promote the true spirit of the World Games. Mr. Wang Zhengting said that the true significance of this year's World Games for our country is that our country was able to participate in it after ten years of hard fighting. The trustee firmly believes that when the domestic situation is stable, given some time, there will definitely be better performances in the next World Games. As for the host country of this World Games, Great Britain, which is suffering from heavy difficulties, it is admirable that it has undertaken this extremely meticulous and intricate task to make this World Games a great success. We cannot hope that Great Britain, which is in economic difficulties, can hold this World Games in the same way as the 1936 Berlin World Games, because Hitler originally used the World Games to promote the strength of the Nazis. But Great Britain has indeed done its best and can be called an excellent host country. This World Games has also been a successful sporting event in terms of attendance, visits, and profits.</p>
<h3 id="e117">First World Games Basketball Match: Our Team Loses to Chile <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, London] On July 30th, the first day of the World Games, at 7:30 PM, our Chinese team and the Chilean team competed in the first basketball elimination round at the Harringay Arena in East London. This match was originally scheduled for August 2nd (Monday), but the announcement of the change was made suddenly on the morning of the 30th. Therefore, the audience was sparse that day, occupying only three-tenths of the seats in the arena. Moreover, not many overseas Chinese from our country came to support the team, because most of our compatriots were unaware of the change.</p>
<p>Unexpected Upset</p>
<p>The course of this match was full of suspense. The Chinese team had a great chance of winning, but the result was an unexpected upset, losing to Chile by a margin of five points. One of the reasons for the defeat was that Li Shiqiao was ill and stranded in Singapore, unable to attend. However, the main reasons were the team's inherent weaknesses – small stature, inferior techniques, slow movements, and poor coordination. Conversely, although the Chilean team's skills were mediocre, the players were tall and strong, with tight and quick movements, and a solid defense. The Chinese team's three forwards were all closely guarded, and severely blocked, ultimately losing all opportunities for close shots. The team's points relied entirely on Cai Wenhua's long shots. Our team's defense was ineffective due to the disparity in physical strength. The reporter witnessed the Chilean team's forwards passing the ball back and forth, making quick close-range shots into the basket six or seven times, while the Chinese team's defense struggled to stop them. In terms of skills, our team was far superior to Chile, and the individual performances were particularly impressive. Foreign spectators praised them greatly, making the defeat honorable. The details of the match are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tianxi Penalized</p>
<p>After the tip-off, the Chilean team took the initiative, launching a fierce offensive, and completely controlled the ball. Fortunately, their shots were inaccurate, missing many good opportunities. Although the Chinese team had very few chances to get the ball, they made almost every shot, and the score remained very close, from 3 to 9, catching up to 8 to 13. After Wu Chengzhang was substituted out, he returned to the court, making long shots and close shots, achieving remarkable feats, bringing the score to 14 to 12, only one point behind. Unfortunately, five minutes before the end of the first half, Huang Tianxi was penalized for his fourth foul and was sent off the court. Li Zhenzhong was substituted in, but our coordination was poor, and the passes were not smooth. The Chilean team seized the opportunity and turned the game into a 14 to 19 situation. The Chinese team rallied and chased hard. Cai Wenhua made a skillful long shot, bringing the score to 18 to 19, only one point behind. The Chilean team was greatly alarmed and called a "time-out." The buzzer sounded, and the first half ended, with our side only trailing by one point. At this time, the audience speculated widely, with more than half believing that our team would definitely win, because the Chilean team's skills were truly mediocre. As long as our side could get the ball, we would definitely be able to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Fighting Vigorously but Defeated</p>
<p>After the time-out, the Chilean team made a comeback, and still controlled the overall situation. Fortunately, their forwards had no confidence in their shots and missed them all, so the score remained close. Our side was unwilling to show weakness, chasing from 18 to 21, to 21 to 24. Cai Wenhua's brilliant performance, shooting from afar and "hitting three times in a row," earned a thunderous applause from the audience. In the last six minutes, the score became 36 to 40, two baskets apart. The atmosphere inside and outside the arena became even more tense, and the spectators frequently shouted "Jiayou" (add oil, a Chinese expression of encouragement). The Chinese basketball coach, Mr. Song Junfu, was flushed and extremely anxious. If we could defeat Chile this time, our team's future would be bright. Unfortunately, our luck was not good. Bao Songyuan missed a free throw, and was then sent off the court for a foul. Yu Ruizhang was substituted in, further weakening our strength. Although we struggled hard, we were ultimately unable to reverse the situation, losing to the Chilean team by a score of 39 to 44.</p>
<p>The referees for this match were You Cilin and Enpaili, who enforced the rules strictly. Players were frequently penalized for fouls. Players from both teams repeatedly missed free throws. Two players from the Chinese team were sent off the court, greatly affecting the game. The lineup of the Chinese team:</p>
<p>[First Half]</p>
<p>Yu Ruizhang (Cai Zhongqiang), Wu Chengzhang (Yu Jin)</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua (Jia Zhijun)</p>
<p>Bao Songyuan, Huang Tianxi (Li Zhenzhong)</p>
<p>[Second Half]</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua (Yu Ruizhang), Wu Chengzhang</p>
<p>Jia Zhijun</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The last group of our representatives attending the World Games to return home, mostly basketball players and swimmers, took a KLM flight to Amsterdam this afternoon to return home, scheduled to arrive in Bangkok on August 18th. They will then transfer to a China Airlines plane to Shanghai, with a possible stopover in Hong Kong for a few days. It is reported that members of our World Games team currently in Manila have sent a telegram inviting our basketball team to travel to Manila to perform a few exhibition games on their way home. However, our World Games team stated that because the basketball team's lineup has been depleted, they have no choice but to decline any invitations. Huang Tianxi, a key defender on our team, has gone to Singapore and did not participate in the match against Italy. At the same time, all of our personnel attending the World Games left London on August 31st. Wang Zhengting, Dong Shouyi, and Hao Gengsheng are scheduled to return home through the United States at the end of this month.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th] Representatives from six Asian countries met here last week to discuss the establishment of an Asian Amateur Athletic Association, and have taken preliminary action on the convening of the Asian Games. A ten-member committee has been established to draft the charter of the Amateur Athletic Association and its affiliated regulations. Our country is represented on the committee by Hao Gengsheng. The association's charter is currently being drafted and will be submitted to various Far Eastern countries for study, and then submitted to the New Delhi Conference for a vote. Yesterday's meeting discussed the location and date of the next Asian Games. Our country proposed that the Asian Sports Association should be convened once every four years, and held in even-numbered years alternating with the World Games. For example, if the World Games are held in 1948 and 1952, then the Asian Sports Association should be held in 1950 and 1954. The meeting decided to accept India's invitation to all Far Eastern countries to hold the Games hosted by India in New Delhi next February. According to people in our sports circles here, our country has expressed its willingness to participate in the New Delhi Games next spring. It is believed that the first Asian Games will be held in the Philippines at the end of May 1950.</p>

Minister Zhu attended and gave a speech, encouraging the instructors to live with the students with a sincere attitude and genuine sympathy. Regarding student life, Minister Zhu said that the Ministry of Education has paid attention to it, and improvements have been made in areas such as food, water, electricity, and newspapers. The government's consistent policy is to care for young people. Students coming from the communist areas have already suffered from displacement, and the government should fulfill its responsibilities and solve various problems one by one.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] National Lhasa School in Tibet is the only national primary school in the country. Since 1947, the school has not received any remittances from the government. For a long time, the school has been struggling in hunger, and the staff has been living in extreme poverty. Principal Xing Suzhi (commissioner of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission) recently returned to Nanjing from India to report on the situation and appealed to all parties to urge the allocation of 18 months of outstanding funds, which has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>When the reporter interviewed Principal Xing yesterday, he said that in the autumn of 1940, the Ministry of Education, recognizing the importance of education in the Tibetan region, transferred Hebalin Qingzhen Primary School to the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, renamed it "Lhasa Primary School in Tibet," allocated additional funds, and established four grades to experiment with the method of promoting co-education to Tibetans. In the autumn of 1945, Principal Xing was appointed by the Border Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education to take charge of the school. After reorganizing the school affairs, the number of students increased sharply. Many children of Tibetans from all over the country requested admission. The students' origins were no longer limited to Han Chinese children, and genuine Tibetans accounted for half of the entire school. In addition, there were also some children of nobles and foreign students from Ladakh, Kashmir, and Nepal who came to the school from afar. Principal Xing said that although the future development of Lhasa Primary School is very optimistic, it is facing the greatest crisis due to the unresolved political contradictions between the Han and Tibetans and the economic difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Lost Books <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>It seems that the poor have a fondness for books. Once they have a volume in their hands, they love it and can't bear to let it go. New books and old books are treated as treasures.</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Bai Yong's "Random Notes" in this publication reminded me that I haven't looked back at my few books for a long time. It's not that I neglect them, but rather because I spend more time living at school and because I lack a large bookshelf to arrange and display them neatly. Every time I look for a book for reference, I have to rummage through boxes and cabinets, resulting in a chaotic mess, and I haven't had the opportunity to organize them. I have always considered this a great regret. But now that I can't even afford to buy a new book, unless I sell my old books by the pound, I would be qualified to buy a bookshelf, but that would be like having an empty wallet with no money, a joke. Therefore, the hope of a bookshelf has never been realized.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the summer vacation, I decided to move the books piled together to the drying platform, regardless of the scorching sun. I wiped the sweat and opened them one by one, allowing these books, which haven't seen the light of day for years, to enjoy a pleasant sunbath.</p>
<p>Like meeting old friends, I greeted Shen Fu from Six Records of a Floating Life, and then exchanged greetings with Tom Sawyer from Mark Twain's pen. Looking at this pile of books and newspapers, many of which had yellowed pages, their age may be older than mine. Most of them were treasured by my father or elder brothers, and the rest were accumulated by me over the past decade. They have increased my knowledge a lot. I was once intoxicated by them, and today it seems like I'm reliving an old dream.</p>
<p>I looked at them triumphantly: ancient volumes, new books, thin books, thick books, Chinese books, English books, small-sized books... I suddenly discovered something strange. I rubbed my eyes heavily with my hand. Where did the larger-sized books go? I was so anxious that I almost jumped up. I turned around and ran back to the small room where the books were piled, but there was no trace of them there.</p>
<p>Then I remembered a maid who was fired by my mother a month ago because she was caught stealing newspapers to give to her lover—a fishmonger. I seemed to see the paper used to wrap the fish in the hands of those housewives was my book. I seemed to see those books had been torn to pieces!</p>
<p>Returning to the drying platform dejectedly, I looked at the books that fortunately escaped the disaster, and couldn't help but feel heartbroken for those that had been lost, including a Thesaurus of Chinese Words that I loved the most.</p>
<p>This is the result of my own carelessness. These books were not destroyed in the fire of war, but were lost in this situation. Isn't it a pity?</p>
<p>The sun fell below the western rooftops, and I took down the books that had been exposed to the sun all day. The next day, I spent the whole day organizing, classifying, and cataloging them. After putting them in boxes, I added a lock.</p>
<p>The wish to buy a bookshelf was again swaying in my mind.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Rambling Talk on Funeral Couplets <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>This publication often has fellow writers compose "Couplets." According to this art in our country's literary history belongs to a side branch, but its difficulty is even greater than prose, poetry, and lyrics. Funeral couplets are also one type of couplet. Now, I will talk about a few examples.</p>
<p>Yuan Shikai was a generation of traitor, who played with the Qing court, betrayed the Republic, and proclaimed himself emperor, thwarted by Cai E, and died in anger. It is not easy to write a eulogy for such a person, so how should one phrase it? Sun Shi Zheng had two couplets for him. The first one says: "Dying of illness and entering eternal rest, let's not discuss the empire or democracy, alas, this world hero's dream has all been turned into illusion. Everywhere there are difficulties and disasters, I hope that from now on, everyone will rest and mind their own business. If you want to determine his merits and demerits for all time, let everyone examine their own conscience!" The second one says: "Throughout his life, he only had two sides, and it was when you, sir, were appointed to the frontier, when people participated in government affairs; even for small talents, he was grateful for the private knowledge, and I secretly felt pity for this old steed. All are of one heart, hoping to avoid the calamity of China being cooked in a cauldron and the tragedy of begging for life. Every time there was a crisis, I deeply enjoyed the eternal joy, and when leaping into the abyss, the headless mass showed their abilities!" The first couplet subtly criticizes him while expressing lament. The second couplet implicitly contains praise. The first couplet speaks of personal friendship, and the second one hopes for national unity, but unfortunately Yuan misled himself. Both of these couplets required a lot of effort.</p>
<p>For the death of General Cai Songpo, it was naturally easier to write a eulogy. For example, the couplet written by Xiong Xiling says: "Bowing down and exhausting himself until his death; a simple burial had his will, still regretting not dying on the battlefield. Although the hero is dead, the country will prosper; he swore an oath to serve great righteousness and never had any selfish desire for the world." Another couplet written by Pu Dianjun says: "His last words serve as a proverb for the world, knowing that his heart was to exhaust himself for the country, even in death he had not finished. This concerns the rise and fall of a hundred years, and the just war was successful, but what will heaven do?" A couplet by Yuan's party member Ni Sichong says: "A flying general? A flying immortal? Riding a horse to the East Sea, riding a whale to the East Sea." "A pioneer? An enlightened one? Mourning him for defending the country, his knowledge surpasses everyone." I don't know who wrote this couplet, but it seems that the bottom couplet came first, followed by the top couplet. "The words 'flying general' are hard to reconcile and are laughable."</p>
<p>When Huang Xing died in Shanghai, I had a couplet for him: "I also do not know why he is so admirable, but looking at the condolences and telegrams, the newspapers publish them in consecutive pages; colleagues, celebrities, weeping and mourning at the door. The sight is shocking, and it is the most tragic event in China! You should regret that the country is still in turmoil. Recalling his travels to Mexico, America, and England, he has traveled tens of thousands of miles; for five years, he maintained the republic and democracy. His suffering and noble character have all been consigned to the eternal waves of the Huangpu River!" This couplet was included in the "Collection of Couplets" published by the Commercial Press, so I still remember it.</p>
<p>When my deceased son, Dunyi, graduated from the Chinese Literature Department of Central University in 1937, he wrote in his handbook: "Staying together for a hundred years is just a dream, and occasionally sharing a meal is nothing but fate!" Unexpectedly, it became a prophecy, and he died in 1940. With deep paternal love, I composed a couplet for him: "Living he could not help, dying he was not heard, staying together for a hundred years is just a dream, and today it is confirmed! Why did he come? Why did he go? Occasionally sharing a meal is nothing but fate, how can I bear to think of it!" At the time, friends who saw it all said that the language was very sad and should be preserved.</p>

<p>Three Days of Summer Retreat</p>
<p>Drawing well water for cool tea, slightly red and yellow watching the flowers of Xiamen, waking up in the north window with nothing to do, washing the knife and breaking the live rattan melon again.</p>
<p>Meeting old friends with invitations, heaven sent three cups of Lu wine, leading to the late wind of the fields, casually passing two or three bridges!</p>
<p>Sparrows chirping, cicadas buzzing, it is already evening, a warm bath can be a good sheep, walking from the east field to sit in the west field, chatting about old things from the past.</p>
<p>Being naked can calm Xie's troubles, too much sweat should be avoided when turning the pages of a book, the clouds in the north sky are dark and scattered, the moon rises on the west wall and the cicadas are busy again.</p>
<p>Children laughing, mother's busy delivery, the afternoon chicken reports the egg getting heavy and yellow! Picking tomatoes in the back garden, stir-frying them together should be used for sacrifice to the drinking intestines.</p>
<p>The newly grown loofah is a chopstick long, the zither hangs under the grape trellis, the thatched hut is on Shangshu bank, but the old surname Wang of the poetic elder is not seen!</p>
<p>Is it possible that there is no dust in the chest? Sitting deeply at night and enjoying myself quietly, the stars in the sky can understand words, and the myriad things in the world are laughed into oblivion.</p>
<p>The crape myrtle blooms brightly, reflecting the clear pool, the green bamboo is cool and good for going down to the game, temporarily happy not hearing about the affairs of the world, but pitying the children discussing heroes and heroines!</p>
<p>The mind is tired, the spirit is dizzy, it is difficult to get excited, the husband is lazy and does not neglect three meals! The upper man seeks a fan for calligraphy, but writes orchids with three leaves and double flowers.</p>
<p>The sorghum branches are high, the sorghum is sparse, the pumpkin leaves are large, the purple eggplant is fat, the flying swallows can speak for the first time, just praising Mr. Returning on this day.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Record of Zheng Dahe <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Zheng Dahe (Wen Zhuo) was as famous for his poetry as Wang Bantang and Mi Guwei, and was exquisitely skilled in epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. When I was in Suzhou, I successively purchased three of his paintings and calligraphies, as well as four kinds of books with his handwritten annotations, so I truly had a karmic connection with Dahe!</p>
<p>The painting is a small landscape, with unique charm and spirit. The inscription poem says: "The cloud river allows a small boat, heaven and earth accommodate a leisurely man." One calligraphy is a self-written draft of the "Yangchun Melody," and the other is a transcription of Han Yu's poem, with vigorous strokes, truly from the Wei stele style.</p>
<p>The "Collection of Mr. Songhu" with Dahe's handwritten annotations that I obtained has a total of six postscripts, which are cherished and enjoyed, and are fifty or sixty years old. There is also a seal "Together with the maid Nan Rou for enjoyment." Dahe lived in Wumen in his later years and enjoyed wandering in the back streets, calling himself: "The old district of Wu is charming, the new office of Fuqiao is elegant, with floral moons linking emotions, and flowing aspirations in music. The northwest high-rise building occasionally leaves traces of love. If not for a love of beauty, how could one be so unhappy? The sorrow of abandoning the world, how can it be stopped?..." It was merely a self-deprecating remark. He had many concubines, some whose names can be traced, including one named "Keke," who is often seen in his annotated books. Dahe was extremely destitute in his later years, often sitting listlessly in tea houses with an old concubine, still claiming to be romantic, which was merely the ingrained habit of a poet.</p>
<p>Dahe liked to scold people, even his teacher Pan Boyin was not spared. The "Collection of Mr. Songhu" was handwritten and published in regular script by Xu Huanong, a historian, at the request of Boyin. Dahe then commented: "I believe that in the past, there were few books copied in this style. Most Song dynasty engraved books imitated Ouyang Xun's official script style, and the Yuan dynasty official editions of classics and histories, as well as private collections, all admired Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy style. During the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods in Jiangnan, the writing samples for Jing Ke's re-engraved books mostly came from Xu Ganping. Recently, Jin Sheng can also make a name for himself with his handwriting; compared to this, there is a world of difference. If the scholars such as Jianping, Lingpu, and Guyu saw this, they would definitely be stunned..." He also said: "This book's style purely uses sideways and flattering strokes to feebly create a running script effect, which not only goes against the ancients, but also greatly deviates from the conventions of copying books. In recent years, among the Hanlin officials who write this style of script, it is most prevalent in Wu, such as Jiang Jianxia and Fei Junzhi, who can all compete with each other, almost forgetting that it originated from Huanong. This is recorded to warn clerks and scholars who record ancient books!" He criticized everything with his own emotions, and almost none of the contemporary leading figures who studied editions were spared. However, his arguments were indeed valid. Famous figures in the late Qing dynasty generally liked to scold people, which was also a trend of the time.</p>
<p>The "Huainan Wanbi Shu" was handwritten by Wu Boyuan, a secretary (Changshou), and Dahe collated and supplemented it, with red and black annotations scattered throughout, and every word was based on evidence. Dahe was indeed proficient in the art of Qihuang (traditional Chinese medicine), and he once hung up his shingle as a doctor.</p>
<p>The "Biographies of Seal Carvers" and "Reading Records of the Leyuan Garden" also have Dahe's postscripts, and his discussions on calligraphy, painting, and seal carving all have insightful words. Kang Youwei said that Dahe was on the verge of death when he entrusted his son Fubei with his posthumous affairs. Youwei then went to manage his funeral and asked about his collection of books, paintings, and antiques, which had all been sold off. This shows how decadent his late years were! Kang Youwei wrote his epitaph, calling him a poet. People only admiringly call him a "cold red" poet, but his writings were very rich, so how can he be limited to just poetry?</p>
<h3 id="e137">Brush-Wetting Flowers <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Shilou</p>
<p>The history of flowers records: "Zheng Rong once wrote a poem about money flowers but couldn't finish it. He dreamed of a woman in red throwing money at him, saying: 'To wet your brush!' When he woke up, he found several buds in his bosom, so he jokingly called it brush-wetting flower."</p>
<p>According to research, the brush-wetting flower is actually the money flower, also known as the Ziwu flower, named because it blooms at noon and falls at midnight. The flower blooms yellow in autumn, with petals shaped like coins, and the green leaves and soft branches are delicate and lovely.</p>
<p>The Garden and Plants Records says: "During the Datong period of the Liang Dynasty, it was brought from foreign countries, and now it is found everywhere. It can be planted in magnetic pots, supported by small bamboo frames, and is also an elegant plaything in the study."</p>
<p>Pi Rixiu's poem about money flowers says: "Yin and yang are charcoal and earth is the furnace, casting gold coins without using molds. Vainly showing off colors in front of people, I don't know if they can help the poor?" It has a different meaning.</p>
<p>All rewards for people's calligraphy, paintings, and manuscript fees are generally called "brush-wetting," but today the most unpromising people are the group who live by the pen, and the brush-wetting flower is specifically named "money," which seems too illogical considering its name and meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Pineapple <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Lychee in English is Litchi, which is probably derived from our country's pronunciation and gotten right. Tea, the British mistakenly pronounce as "te," not knowing that the original word is the common pronunciation in the Minnan and Chaozhou dialects. It is said that the Russians first got tea from our north, and took the sound of the two words "tea leaves" as the name, pronouncing it as "cha-i." Lemon, we call it 檸檬 (ning meng), just like the use of foreign sounds for grapes, goji berries, and pyinbos. However, our country's farmers have only recently started trying to grow this thing, and it is still not as good as foreign goods. Growing fruit is indeed not easy. There are lemons in the South, which are actually the English Lime, and their round shape shows that they are not lemons. The ripe and large ones look like oranges at first glance. Oranges are grafted with lemons, so their fragrance is stronger but the taste is inevitably sour, and the southerners also like their flavor. Why is pineapple called "波羅" (Bolo)? When asked people from Guangdong and Guangxi, no one can say, it must be a foreign word. Jackfruit grows on the trunk of a large tree, like warts, and the large ones hang on the trunk like winter melons or buckets of rice. Its seeds can also be cooked and eaten, and taste like old chestnut meat. The "paramita" in Buddhist scriptures means "reaching the other shore," I don't know why this fruit also got this name. 波羅 (Bolo) in English is Pineapple. The Oxford dictionary says it is named for its shape resembling a pine cone, but this is a herbaceous plant. Someone told me that there are "pineapple trees" in a certain place, which is following the name of the market people and mistakenly taking 波羅 (Bolo) for 波羅蜜 (jackfruit), and then taking 波羅蜜 (jackfruit) for pineapple.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>During illness, taking the propaganda and debate texts of world heroes before and after World War II and reading them, I feel bored, and their verbal attacks and lip service are each extremely ingenious in their wording, just like the tacticians of the Five Hegemons and Seven Heroes era of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. It can be seen that "turbulent times produce heroic writing," which is the same principle in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Taking President Roosevelt's "fireside chats" and comparing them with Hitler's "cellar speeches," the verbal battles are fierce. As for Churchill's and Hitler's words of attacking enemy countries in their respective parliaments, and whether Hitler's sending of troops to southern France to face Pétain and Yang, and the declaration of war on the Soviet Union, are reasonable or not, we can leave that aside. Just looking at the articles themselves, "the words on the paper are all lofty," and "the spirit is strong and the words are appropriate," which are solid masterpieces of the "Zuo Zhuan" and "Guoyu" streams. Those who are frightened by modern warfare only know the shocking sight of airplanes, cannons, seaplanes, and atomic bombs, why not also pay attention to the essays that use the pen as a battle array and the words as pearls?</p>
<p>Hitler admired Napoleon, and imitated his military exercises, and even told little jokes, and tried his best to imitate them. On December 11, 1941, Hitler's speech (in his parliament) to follow Japan in declaring war on Britain and the United States, said: "When Roosevelt called me a 'thug,' I would like to point out that this word originated in the United States, and there is no identical word in Europe." Because Roosevelt's fireside chats once referred to Hitler as an "international thug," Hitler did not make a direct defense, but thought it was clever to say that this word belonged to the United States, but in fact he copied the old phrase that there is no "difficult" word in Napoleon's dictionary. Also, a year before the July 7th Incident, when Hirota was the foreign minister of Japan, he announced the so-called three principles towards China. Someone asked about the possibility of war, and Hirota laughed and said: "There is no 'war' word in the dictionary of diplomats." This is also stealing the old words of Napoleon.</p>
<p>When I was young, my English textbook told a story about the West, called "Napoleon's Smart Reply." One day, the emperor was talking with a German general, and the German general said: "Germans fight for honor, while French fight for money." The emperor replied with a smile: "Indeed, we each strive for what we lack." He said that Germans have always lacked honor, so they must strive for honor in war, and the French have always been rich in honor, but lack money, so they use war to make up for their needs. With a turn of the question, the verbal point is chilling, who said that the emperor only works in military affairs? During the Spring and Autumn period, Yanzi of Qi was sent to Chu. The King of Chu intended to humiliate him. When he was drunk, he brought two bound men to him and said, "They are Qi people and sat as thieves." He looked at Yanzi and said, "Are Qi people inherently good at stealing?" Yanzi replied, "I heard that oranges born in Huainan become trifoliate oranges when planted in Huaibei, the leaves are similar but the taste is different because of the different soil and water. Now that people are born in Qi and do not steal, but steal when they enter Chu, could it be that the soil and water of Chu make people good at stealing!" The King of Chu laughed and said, "Sages are not to be joked with, I have instead taken the blame." Yanzi's words and Napoleon's words can be said to be different songs played with equal skill.</p>
