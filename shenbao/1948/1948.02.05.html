<h3>軍火轉入匪手說　董局長斥爲無稽</h3>
<p>分配情形有圖表可證</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕董局長今日在記者會宣稱：一月卅日紐約郵報載記者霍布斯之報導謂：去夏美國運往中國之一億三千萬發子彈，其中一半被直接售予共匪云云。此項消息，絕對無事實之根據，本人曾自國防部獲得資料，對於上述彈藥之分配情形，則有詳明統計表，足以證明霍布列所稱各節，絕非事實，惟該表事涉軍機，不能發表，倘使透露，徒使共匪快意而已。吾人可以斷言，霍布斯所稱各節，乃係惡意揑造事實，毫無根據。至其所謂若干軍火，係由政府人士於上海碼頭，直接售予共匪之指責，尤屬荒謬無稽，不値一駁。霍布斯之文稿，發自華府，據謂：消息係來自「負責常局」，或係故意誣蔑，倘國務院果擬獲知此事之實情，則我國國防部隨時準備供給資料。</p>
<h3>主席召見杜聿明　對記者堅決否認將出任新職</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕蔣主席四日下午一時在官邸召見杜聿明，並留同進午餐，談話歷一小時許，至下午二時許，杜氏始辭出。杜氏於晚間接見記者時，對外間所傳　將出任新職事，仍予堅決否認，並謂：謁見主席時，曾而陳健康情况，請求繼續請假休養半年，並已得主席而允。記者詢其主席所允者係繼續休養「半年」，抑爲一「極短時期」？杜則未作肯定答復。杜氏並稱：現在健康雖較前進步，但雙腿仍不能吃力，必須再作休養。記者再詢以休養將在何地？杜答稱，將先在京稍住，再作決定。又四日中午，于右任亦曾　請杜氏，因杜須謁主席，未終席即先行辭出。</p>
<h3>修正貨物稅條例　俟完成立法和序後公布</h3>
<p>今年上半年稅收預定十二萬億</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕現行之貨物稅條例，三日政務會議已根據財部所擬辦法予以修正，俟送交立院完成立法程序後，即可公布實施。該條例修正之目的，一面在整頓稅收，增加國庫收入，一面亦注意减輕人民負担，扶植手工業，半機製業之生存，除奢侈品加征貨物稅百分之六十外，若干手工業品及半機製品貨物稅均予免征，或另加以調整，其修正之要點爲：免征品目，一，茶葉稅因係出口物資，爲鼓勵外銷起見，決予免征，二，錫箔及迷信用紙，此項用紙應在取締之列，劃歸地方。三，水灰。四，水泥。麥粉屬於半機製者免征，純機製者仍照征。五，皮毛稅改提稅　，皮革毛統不征，改征毛綫毛紗稅及調整部分。化裝品之屬於奢侈品者，如香水，口紅等均征貨物稅百分之六十，其屬於普通化裝品者，如雪花膏，花露水等，征貨物稅百分之三十。關於稅制方面，亦有重要修正，過去條例中規定每三個月評價一次，現爲顧及物價隨時高漲，避免稅收受損失計，決根據切實從價原則，改爲每月評價一次。又財部擬增外征收「汽油稅百分之十」一項，三日政務會討論時，認爲汽油進口稅最近已增收百分之四十，此時未便再征貨物稅，故未予通過，財部將呈請政院，另行專案辦理，但爲維護生產，鑛產稅仍繼續緩辦。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕據財部稅務署方面息，卅六年度貨物稅收總額，截至二月三日止，所獲報吿總數計四六四〇一億元，較去年預算一二四〇〇億元超收兩倍以上。又卅七年上半年貨物稅收預算，已預定爲十二萬億元。</p>
<h3>立院五委會聯席會議　硏計國家總預算　該案今正式提院會審核</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立法院財政，經濟，法制，外交，軍事等五委會，四日全日開聯席會議，劉克　主席，硏討卅七年度上半年國家總預算，國府主計長徐堪，政院財政部長兪鴻鈞（代表張院長），交通部長兪大維，社會部長谷正綱，糧食部長兪飛鵬，敎育部長朱家驊等均列席，分作說明。徐堪並表示，如物價無何變動，此半年之預算可望足數，不必追加。會末，各委員並對若干政府措施提出意見，略誌如次：　對豪門特稅政府無決心執行，以致行成貧者愈貧，富者愈富之情形，過去曾決定征收建國特捐，旋改爲救濟特捐，政府對此實應決心執行。　幣制之改革，囚事實之需要，應考慮其改革之準備。　公敎人員待遇，在原則上應予改善。　總預算歲入部門過少，並較空洞，旋經徐堪，兪鴻鈞等分別說明解釋，並決定邀張羣院長出席五日之例會，對政府政策予以說明。五日立院舉行本　復會後　次例會，此項預算案將正式提付審核，如時間許可，公敎人員調整待遇及追認郵電加價兩事，亦將有所討論。</p>
<h3>一年來剿匪軍事總檢討　國防部新聞局發表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國防部新聞局四日發表一年來剿匪軍事的總檢討，全文如次：</p>
<p>共產黨所欠中國民族的一筆血債</p>
<p>自從三十五年夏季，匪首毛澤東，授命林彪各匪徒，在東北被接受國際補充而大量的武裝起來，拒絕中國人民收復淪陷十四年的國土。接着，是年秋季冬季當中，匪在延安就連下了三次的動員令，向祈求和平的四億五千萬人民挑起戰火，一方面在國際上拚命運動莫斯科的外長會議來干涉中國內政，以達其割裂國土，爭奪政權的陰謀。同時，還用一貫的欺騙宣傳，眾中國老百姓的血肉，來朦蔽全世界的耳目，眩耀匪徒們的政治賭本，以抬高自己的身價。</p>
<p>在過去一年左右，東北華北的工廠礦山被這批匪徒們破壞，拆毀，遷移……的損失估計，已逾百億美元的價格，比抗戰八年中的工礦損失還重，所破壞的鐵路，公路，橋樑，涵洞，車輛，站房，倉庫，建築的代價，已足供中國新建設七千公里以上的鐵路。所破壞或焚毁或掠奪與遷移到太行山，五台山……各山區匪巢的公私醫院，電氣材料，印刷器材，醫藥器材，糧食布疋……，由俘虜的自供：「連他們看見了這各破壞，都暗自流淚」！這個毀損的數目，更大得無法統計。</p>
<p>總計一年來，中國民族所受這批叛國奸匪在經濟上，文化上，道德上，敎育上……的損失，比起歷史上從石敬塘，黃巢，張邦昌，李自成，到吳三桂，汪精衛等任何一次的損失都大。</p>
<p>毛澤東匪徒們口裏在喊民主自由，實際上匪區鐵幕裏，他並不容許任何人們的居住自由，信仰自由，行動自由，言論自由，他們作賊心虛，甚至不敢容許非匪區以外的任何中外記者的進入匪區，調査訪問和自由行動。</p>
<p>去年一年中，在東北華北華中各省，由匪區裏逃出來一千四百五十一萬多難民，他們寗可到處流浪乞討，呼吸自由的空氣，而不願意回到家鄕遭受恐嚇脅迫的痛苦。封鎖在匪區的人民，不是被迫參軍，便是一家骨肉分散，產業鬥光，最後還要淸算到每一個人的思想，意識和祖先的傳統歷史。他們把來北的三千萬人民都編組起來，常異族的工作奴隸，把華北各省七千多萬農民，在不到一年的時問裹，用「鬥爭」，「淸算」，「參軍」，暗殺，苦工等辦法……，急减了人口約二千多萬（根據俘虜和逃出的公務員與學生所講的綜合統計），事實上，匪區裏的「土地改革」，已造成了「有田無人耕」，到處荒蕪，無人接受分地的現象，匪首們在這種無兵可參，無糧可徵，無衣可穿的飢寒交迫情勢中，只好喊出「流竄」，「反攻」的口號，向政府區域內來「求衣」，「求食」，「求兵」，意圖擾亂全國，補充叛亂資本。</p>
<p>匪徒們欠了中國民族這樣巨大的血債，毛匪澤東意猶不足，在前月竟無恥的向世界上招供他還打算把中國四億五千萬人民和亞洲其他五億人民，都一齊拖進共產國際的深淵裏去。可是，這些賣國勾當，一年來早已經激起了全中國人民的憤怒，東北的人民要求政府加緊收復國土，華北的同胞奔走呼號，請求國軍的救援，華中人民到處都喊出「保家鄉」，「滅奸匪」的口號，華南的人民也　加緊動員督促政府戡亂。從去年一年中，匪徒們一批一批的被打垮了，一股一股的流竄亡命了，一羣一羣的逃上山寨了，在蘇北，在山東，在陜北，和在長江以北各地區的流寇們，甚至逼得來開始訓練被打垮以後如何「化整爲零」，「化零爲整」，「化匪爲民」的三化辦法了。（下文轉入二版）</p>
<h3>翁文灝談資委會工作　江南籌設鋼鐵廠　東北事業基礎力求保持</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電」資源委員會委員長翁文灝，四日接見記者，談及本年度該會工作稱：資委會工作為在配合整個國策下，盡力開發國家資源。我國工礦事業以東北規模最大，華北，台灣次之，惜兩年多來東北工礦建設初被蘇軍運走，繼為共匪破壞。華北方面亦陸續為共匪滋擾，致工作難展開，全國工業基礎精華所在，爲匪阻擾破壞之情形，至足痛心。目前東北事業，吾人深明其重要性，當在國軍保護下力求保持其基礎。華北方面尙較台灣爲優，不容忽視，如唐山，天津，北平一綫發電及煉鋼鐵設備齊全，規模可觀，仍將積極開爐增產。江南各地工礦建設，將竭力進行，主要有五：　華中贛西，湘口，湖湘，湘永四煤礦擴充設備，積極增產，以供給武漢，廣東等地。　以海南島鐵礦礦砂外銷，所獲外匯全部作為建設鋼鐵廠之用，今年內籌備設立。　台灣高雄煉油廠，去年修復，石油大量精煉已無問題，現正設法多運原油，過去我國油輪四艘均已損壞，去年修復一艘，今已二度自阿拉伯運原油返高途中，每次一萬噸，第二艘即可修復，屆時可增產一倍。　其他增產目標糧卅萬噸，水泥卅六萬噸，紙二萬五千噸。　台灣工礦逐漸擴充設備，謀充份發展。</p>
<h3>全經會今討論　經濟方案財交四部門</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中美合作開發台灣</h3>
<p>據本報南京消息，中美方面正進行對開發台省富源及扶植台灣工礦事業之商談；美方對此極顧投咨協助，並着重於兩點；一爲經濟的，卽對工礦事業之扶植，一爲軍事的，美將助我完成我在台海軍根據地之計劃。現此項投資合作，在原則上已不成間題，目前正就技術問題研究中，如獲實現，美除以經濟援我外，並將以大批技術人員遺台，協助工作進行。另據南京傳來的美國聯合社電訊，據負責人士稱，魏德邁將軍實地調査中國局勢時，曾提出華南經濟復興方案，據謂：華南政治與經濟如能安定，美國自願給予援助。在舉國戡亂，努力於生產建國的今日，對於此項消息的傳來，我們感到無限的歡欣。</p>
<p>本來，自從勝利以來，我們對於台灣及華南的經營，原應積極展開，台灣淪陷垂五十年。這五十年來，台灣人民飽嘗日本軍閥統治苦味；今番山河重光，我全國人民除對於台灣的重歸祖國懷抱，表示無限的興奮以外，還希望由於台灣的重歸祖國懷抱，能有裨益於此後我國民族經濟的發展，及增進台灣本身的繁榮，過去五十年間日本對於台灣的經營，全以日本爲中心，而且全以日本國防的需要爲中心：其出發點全爲榨取台灣的資源以爲日本之用，它所施行的可以說是一種完全對付殖民地的經濟政策，其不利於台灣自身經濟的繁榮，自甚明顯。這種局勢，自台灣重歸祖國懷抱以來，原應早已設法糾正：祗以國內有共匪的作亂，全國人民動員戡亂，政府亦一時無法兼顧及此，用是因循至今。我們偶一想念及此，除痛恨共匪的禍國以外，也實在深覺遺憾。但我們的戡　是與建國並進的；戡亂同時建國，如此雙管齊下，我們纔能及早完成此一三民主義共和國的建設，講到建設，我們自不能不首先想到台灣。</p>
<p>過去五十年來的日本統治，已使台灣有了相當的工業基礎；如前所述，此一工業基礎是以日本爲中心的，未必對於台灣有利，我們必須設法糾正過來。例如在今日的台灣，留下有日本人所經營的石油廠和製　工業，而台灣本無巨量鋁鑛及石油的生產·在農業方面，台灣地瘠多山，本不宜於蔗糖的生產，爲了日本本國的需要，於是迫使台灣農民放棄在經濟上爲有利的糧食生產；而一向爲台灣獨占世界市塲的樟腦工業，在以前居世界　額的百分之八十，現在却已衰落不堪。此種經濟局勢如何矯正過來，進而如何充分開發台灣的咨源，應爲我國在建國的大業上所亟應努力的對象。况東北九省的工礦設備，自勝利以來，多被搬移摧毁：如果我們要有一個重要經濟區如魯爾區那樣　建立，我們尤不可忽略了台灣。</p>
<p>因此，中美合作開發台灣的消息傳來，我們寄予歡欣，寄予期望。據報傳消息，中美在台灣的合作將包括軍事的與經濟的兩方面。就經濟的方面言，我們在消極方面應該排除那以日本爲中心的台灣經濟設施及體系，積極方面應該努力於如何使台灣特有的工業能有健全的發展，以後如何使台灣的經濟建設能與整個民族的經濟建設相配合。美國之與我們合作開發台灣，不僅爲中美間傳統友誼的又一表徵，且爲馬歇爾計劃的一種在亞洲的反映。我們到現在雖還不曾明瞭，中美在台灣的合作是否卽爲美國援華計劃中的一部；不過就目前的跡象，如果將它包括在美政府的援華計劃內，我們牛怕此一合作恐未必能有理想的收穫。因爲照報傳消息，美政府的援華方案，總數僅三億美元，又須分十五個月支付，杯水車薪，似乎於事無濟。如果將台海的開發包括在內，則援華的數字，勢須增加；否則應當專案另提。我們在此無須重述此一投資對美國如何有利，此在明眼人中，是早有定論的了。</p>
<p>至於關於軍事的建設，台灣爲戰略要地，關係重要，不待多言。我們尤其感到興趣的是美將助我完成我在台海軍根據地之計劃。這使我們回想起昔鄭氏父子的占有台灣，得力於海軍之助的特多。在今後的建國努力上，我們尤其不該忽略了海軍的重要。在對日的抗戰中，我們因爲海疆不固，致使敵軍橫行無阻。懍於此一敎訓，我海軍在台灣的建設，尤不照延緩。願由於中美兩國的合作，我在台的海軍建設得以照計劃而完成，台灣的經濟資源得到充分的利用。這樣對於安定勢力的扶植，太平洋乃至世界整個的和平，纔能確保！</p>

<p>昨日本報社論「安定第一，法紀至上」一文，其最後數語被顚倒誤植，茲校正如下：「另一方面，對一切舉措設施，也要深思熟慮，不可再送幾個題目給他們呀！我們要請全國上下大家注意：安定第一！法紀至上！」</p>
<h3>收購成品救濟工業　沈熈瑞在津已議定辦法　放欵銀行嚴密注意用途</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津四日電〕國行業務局長沈熈瑞奉命來津，辦理收購各廠成品及救濟中小工業，刻已與津市當局商定辦法。茲誌如次：　各工廠之成品經收購後不准付息贖回。　對於中小工廠及手工業透過商業銀行之四百億貸款利息改爲十八分，以杜流弊，其超過原定利息之八分將來由承辦銀行捐作地方公益之用。貸款期限定爲半個月，以防春節後物價波動。　各放款銀行對各工廠申請收購價款之用途應嚴加考核，不准移作其他用途，如有違反前項規定者，一經査獲，即交由主管機關議處。</p>
<h3>營利所得稅　財長稱稽征辦法公允</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕卅七年度營利事業所得稅稽征辦法，經政院公布施行後，財長兪鴻鈞特發表談話謂：「政府爲動員戡亂實施緊急措施，對本年營利事業所得稅稽征辦法，係參酌各國估稅制度之精神，採用估繳制度，因此類所得稅之計算手續較繁，往往自每年二三月開始征役，直至九十月始能收齊，不能適應財政需要。本部爲减少發行，平衡收支，經一再硏討，呈奉核准，由納稅人按估定稅額先行繳納，俟依稅法核定實際稅額後，多退少補。至於退稅，照當地央行存款利率加退利息。此項估定稅額係照去年核定各納稅人所利得稅稅額六倍計算。緣本年國家總預算較卅六年增二十倍半，本年營利事業所得稅歲入預算較卅六年增十四倍。又卅六年全國物價總指數較卅五年約增十二倍，現照去年稅額先按六倍估計繳納，尙係從低估計。政府爲適應收支，爭取稅收時問，規定先以六倍估計繳納，餘俟實際稅額核定後多退少補，自廢公允。至卅六年十一月設立商號，暫按實收資本額　百分之十二點六估定暫繳稅額，負担更輕。甚望各業獎念時艱，踴躍繳納，尤盼輿論界多方宣導，予以協助。</p>

<p>匪徒們造亂賣國的資本，就是「參軍」，「擴軍」，和「軍事共產化」。他只要控制了多少人口，就將那些人口中的男女老幼嚴密封鎖，實行比「納粹」還澈底的軍事管制。遠在三十四年冬，匪首毛澤東從重慶回返延安後，他就在匪的中央政治局，提出準備向各戰區國軍掩護下的抗日陣地後方，擴充游擊隊三百萬的訓令。到了日寇投降，匪首們把蘇魯冀晋熱察綏的徒手老八路，土八路，新四軍………都分由熟河山東送到東北武，起來，他們冒充抗日，從不曾正式與日寇作戰，他們口稱愛國，但在中國來北，新疆，內蒙，東蒙，至今還在策動「獨立」「自治」的分裂中國運動。自從共匪叛亂以來，在過去一年半的時間內，國軍的傷亡失散雖然將折五十萬人，但是匪軍的傷亡洮散投誠，及被國軍俘獲的人數，已超過一百三十八萬七千五百六十七名的代價（內含去年內被擊斃和被俘　匪軍官兵七十六萬五千名）。這　是　徒們以共黨幹部政委所控制的中國良民，加上一頂「解放軍」的帽子，便成了匪軍。政治資本。他們把東北華北的農民分成立五個指　　統，交匪首林彪，聶榮臻，陳毅，劉伯承，陳賡，和徐向前，彭德懷，賀龍各匪分頭指揮，總計現在擴充到了一百一十五萬的野戰軍和軍區部隊與民兵。</p>
<p>他們如此拼命的擴軍，不斷的發動了冒險的戰爭，仗恃着國際帮凶的奧援，在三十六年中，匪軍共竄踞了來北，華北，華中大小城鎭三百三十八座，但經國軍開始動員總攻以後，半年左右，克復了重要城鎭七十二座，尙淪陷匪區二六六座，其中有曾經得失二三次以上者。在這種地區的得失中，我們發現了成千成萬渴想自由的人民，向我們招手歡呼，他們失去了自由，才知道眞正自由的可愛，他們受了匪從們分土地的欺騙，骨肉離散，親友成仇，結果土地充了公，糧食繳完了，剩下的連自己都吃不飽，最後還要「參軍」，常砲灰，弄到家破人亡財盡。</p>
<p>過去十二個月中，戰塲上戰鬥，大小達八十二次之多，平均每月都有五次到十次的激戰，最近三個月來的戰鬥，每月幾乎增加到十二次以至十九次之多，尤其是　窠的强盜們，在最近四個月當中，他們被豫西·豫東·魯西。魯南。　北的民團，到處打得　花流水，　　河南一省的民團，一年由配合國軍　　　　，前後就打死匪七萬三千一百八十一員名之多，而民團損失不過一萬八千四百人。匪徒們把這些爲爭取農民生存的民團恨極了，喊出「消滅民團」的口號，但是結果中國「保家鄕」，「滅奸匪」的人民愈發强健起來了，他們把八年中「打鬼子」的精神，又甫整旗鼓，用來打這　吃人鮮血的惡魔了。</p>
<p>在這些戰役當中，國軍的損失，比較匪的損失僅爲三與一的比例。在每次戰爭當中，匪把地方軍區部隊和民兵用機槍大砲逼向第一綫衝鋒，徼倖成功了，匪便把民兵和軍區部隊升爲野戰軍，以後打仗就在二綫；如果民兵都在第一綫犧牲光了，眼看國軍要打倒匪徒們的野戰軍頭上了，便預先溜走，這就是老匪的實力不易損失，匪區的人口急速减少的根本原因。匪儘管用這種慘無人道的「人海戰術」，但還是淹沒不了國軍殺　的英　精神，一年常中除東北不計，單在華北華中，國軍所獲的各種火小砲共三百七十三門，重機槍五百二十五挺，輕機槍一千三百四十三挺，長短新舊步槍十萬零七千七百五十六支，這都有詳細的統計和來源·時間·地點·和每次戰役記載，並有圖表和照片。</p>
<p>然而這種剿匪的成就，並不算是國軍偉大成魷，我們的成就，還是在戰略上的收穫縮短了匪徒們的生命。</p>
<p>政府剿匪用的是速戰速決與中央突破的戰略，一面要打破匪的政治中心與盤踞負嵎的老巢，一而要堵剿匪寇們四出擾亂破壞的流竄。因此，一年來剿匪戰略的演變，在關內打破了匪的政治中心延安和山東同膠重的根據地，隔斷了匪在海上的補給綫，在關外又阻擊了匪七次攻勢的破壞流竄。我們祗要檢閱共匪在「保衛延安」，「保衛山東」，同「反攻陜北」，「反攻山東」的宣傳文件，以及從去年九月以來共匪發動的全國總反攻，實行全面流竄的事實，就可以證明共匪的戰略是失敗的，政府剿匪的戰略是成功的，這種成功，正給了毛匪澤東所宣傳的「消耗戰」以無情打擊。</p>
<p>今日國人已在客觀的分晰比較下，都知道共匪的政策是國際的，階級的，破壞的，擾亂的，專政的，黑暗的，同時更知道國民政府同國民黨的政策是民族的，全民的，建設的，和平的，民主的，光明的，這已有千萬事實爲之證明，因此在這裏我們可以斷定剿匪的前途雖然還很艱苦，但最後結果必定是戡亂必勝，建國必成（完）</p>
<h3>一週來全般戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國防部四日發表元月廿九日至二月四日一週來的全般戰局，全文如次：</p>
<p>這一星期各戰塲的國軍，均隨戰况而活躍起來，有的芷在向預定的有利地帶疾進，有的已經揭開了勝利的序幕。東北遼北的國軍，在克復東丰西丰之後，乘勝追剿，已經控制住中長路以東的村鎭，吉長地區國軍自展開掃蕩以來，擊破中韓蒙匪的殘部甚多，刻吉長兩地周圍百餘里以內已少匪踪。在此情勢下，遼西南方面的匪，恐怕關內外國軍的聯合夾擊，乃集合其一，二，三，四，六，七，八，九，各縱隊，用流竄的方式，向遼陽與新民西南及黑山，打虎山等處進擾，一股曾竄渦溝帮子，幷至錦州附近，想截斷平瀋交通，减輕國軍東向的壓力，但是國軍勁旅却正源源的出關，到達預定地點，準備給該匪以迎頭痛擊。</p>
<p>在冀察方面，察南國軍在收復四海站，黃花城等戰役中，擄獲匪方修械廠糧服廠及軍要倉庫十二個之多，內中盡是械彈糧秣。接着於一月卅日，又收復桑樹，靑石岩，黃士楔等重要據點。至於華北匪之一，七等縱隊，仍藏匿於平保錢西南山地整補，其二，三，四，六，四個縱隊殘部，則分竄於安新，唐縣，文安，定縣，各附近地區，一方因軍心渙散，幹部動搖，正在作內部複査，淸算，鬥爭，一方面則四出各鄕强拉人民「參軍」，以謀補充再圖蠢動。</p>
<p>至於大別山區的劉伯承匪部，用盡伎倆，想躱避國軍的圍殲，但我英勇國軍，絕不肯放鬆一步，到處啣尾追剿，在岳西西北，擊潰匪第三縱隊一千餘，生俘四百零一人。此外，在淮河北岸新蔡，正陽，息縣間，經過四天的追剿，到昨天爲止，共計打垮該匪一二兩縱隊主力四個團又兩個連的兵力，該匪現在已四散奔逃，化整爲零，國軍正加緊搜剿中。</p>
<p>至於魯豫地區陳毅匪部的兩廣縱隊，一日在太康以西被國軍攻擊，由扶溝，西華中間地區向西逃命，其八，十，十一，各縱隊，仍被國軍在定陶，曹縣，城武問圍攻，一，三，四，六各縱隊，則被迫竄集郾城周圍地區，圖與陳賡匪部合流，想衝出一條活路，但平漢綫南北國軍，正與各地團隊配合進擊，預料該地區之匪將遭痛殲，匪或繼續走上逃亡之途。</p>
<p>當流寇們正在東奔西逃的時候，所有各地匪區的人民，都展開了對匪英勇的自衛鬥爭，並且紛紛組織自衛團，自己捐款，自己出槍出糧的保衛家鄕，這個偉大的運動，已逐漸普遍到了匪區，不特使各地共匪發抖，並且逼使匪首們又在大喊「復査」，「淸黨」，「肅軍」，以鞏固其內部的統治。正因爲其內部矛盾加深，軍政幹部動搖者日衆，其相互殘殺與鬥爭更慘，我們預料在不久的將來，全般的戰局，必定隨着這個人民自衛與匪部內鬨的洪流而顯出新的局面。</p>

<h3>三强本月十九集會倫敦　商討西德行政改革　英美促法參加聯邦銀行避免幣制分裂　弗郎克福憲章下週可宣布</h3>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎四日電〕法外交部發言人四日宣佈：英美法三國討論德國西部未來地位之會議，將於二月十九日在倫敦啓幕。法美兩國將各派其駐英大使爲代表。英美官員希望能勸令法國參加英美共同佔領區，而組織萊茵佔領區，使西德由單一之行政機關管制。</p>
<p>〔路透社弗朗克福三日電〕德國負責人士相信，弗朗克福憲草之遲不宣布，在於英美法之就建立西德聯邦銀行事尙宋結束其討論之故。本於一月間弗朗克福之決議加以修正而成之合併區憲草，可望由英美當局於下週初發表。四强統一德國幣制改革之談判如遭失敗，則建議的西德聯邦銀行在任何西德幣制改革中，將擔任極重要之任務，故英美雖願不再等待法國，逕行實行合併區之行政改革，一方面則亟願法國參加聯邦銀行，以避免西德幣制之分裂。倫敦英美法三國會議所將討論之幣制合作計劃，諒不致促成法國已與英美區之全部今併，但將促成若干區問壁壘之移除，包括物資旅客之自由往來等。三佔領區共設中央銀行之事，亦將優先予以考慮。關係方面相信英美除與法國洽商合併區實施改革之政治及行政性質外，並曾與法協商設立銀行之事。聞其中主要困難，仍爲聯邦卞義與中央主義之爭。英美之草案，規定由各邦銀行總裁共選聯邦銀行之經理會，而德國專家則認經理會不可過受邦銀行之牽制，故主張由聯邦銀行總裁任命經理委員會。</p>
<p>〔路透社史都迦特三日電〕德境美國軍政府長官克萊將軍，今日在此舉行記者招待會，表示美國政府歡迎德國得有聯邦政府，在討論聯邦組成機構之際，包括中央與各邦職權之劃分等，需時不免甚久。美國建國之初經過此一過程，渠希望未來之德國政府，應是彈性而不是硬性。凡德國大多數人民贊成之政府，均美國人民所歡迎。克萊並透露弗蘭克福德國經濟委員會之宣言，可望於下週發表，肅淸納粹工作約可於一九四八年六月一日完成。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕馬歇爾今日再向參院外委會發出警吿，指出國會擬將馬歇爾方案實施之最初十五個月內之援助費削至六十八億元之下，則援歐方案之成功，將受其妨碍。當馬歇爾向國會發出此項警吿之際，國務部外有人示威，反對方案內建議的以美國船舶移讓歐洲國家，此次示威係全國海員公會所組織，彼等反對將美國商船五百艘出售或移讓歐洲。</p>
<h3>西歐聯盟制瑞典不參加</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕斯德哥爾摩電臺宣布：瑞典將不參加任何西歐聯盟制度，若英外相貝文最近所建議者。英外部發言人表示對此並不驚異，蓋瑞典素主中立，故英國亦並未向其接洽。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京四日電〕關於整肅前農林相平野力三問題而引起之一番熱烈糾紛，本日突然結束，蓋最高法院已將東京地院對政府決定整肅平野之禁令作廢。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶錄</h3>
<p>北美報業聯合會版權所有</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>「數量的」和「質素的」爭論</p>
<p>倫敦海軍會議在一九三五年召開，直至一九三六年三月底結束，羅斯福總統對於會議的進展情形，具有强烈的興趣民。簡直從幼年時代起，他對各色各樣的船隻，一直具有廣泛的經驗。甚至在孩提時代，經過新英格蘭海岸附近的海軍船隻，就特別吸引他的注意。常他到華盛頓來担任威爾遜政府的海軍部長時，即以精通有關海軍的問題，戰術，事實和管理而見稱於時。他在離開職位的時候，對於一切重要的海軍問題，巳有深刻的研究，並爲海軍而神往。</p>
<p>當他出任總統之時，他對於海軍的知識或許比他任何一個前任爲多。在他整個任職總統的時期中，我發覺他對於有關海軍的每一個問題，總予以優先的注意。凡是海軍事務方面比較重要的決議，大多數由他親自定奪。在倫敦海軍會議中，總統對於技術的各方面，表現罕有的知識。他極有資格討論最偏屬於技術方面各種發展的優點，並且提供建議。就是最老和最有經驗的海軍上將，對於他海軍方面的湛深知識，也具有極大的敬意。</p>
<p>在我發給總統的電報中，以及我們在倫敦會議席上的口頭討論中，關於限制海軍軍備，我們曾經使用「數量的」和「質素的「這兩個字句達數十百次之多，前者指限制總噸位，後者指限制各種船隻的大小和砲位的口徑。有一天，總統耐不住性了。他喊着說，「數量的，質素的，數量的，質素的，我對於這幾個字句聽得厭煩了。我們能不能找尋些字眼來代替它們呢？」但是，我們並沒有找到。</p>
<p>二月二十八日，總統對於海軍條約提出了一個建議。他把它以備忘錄的形式送達國務院，繼而我們就用常報發給當時在倫敦的我國代表國團長戴維斯（Norman　Davis）。這個建議，結晶於倫敦條約中的一部份，而成為會議中最重要發展之一。總統說，「假如我們發一個電報給戴維斯，呌他設法從英國·法國·義大利（並且經由英國從德國）甚至獲致一個君子協定，藉使每一個國家同意在決定建造超過一百噸的任何形式的海軍船隻時必須通知其他國家，你對於這個辦法，以爲如何？假如這樣一個君子協定可以獲致，那麼這四個或者五個國家就可以聯合起來，或者由它們中的幾個邀請日本同樣辦理。」</p>
<p>德國應否成爲條約簽字國的問題，是一個微妙問題。一九三五年六月十八日，英國和德國簽訂了一項協定，規定德國的海軍爲英帝國海軍的百分之三十五。因爲這個數字，較諸凡爾賽條約准許德國保有的海軍實力達三倍之多，法國和義大利提出强硬抗議。至於我們這一邊，則繼續不願有所表示，因爲英德協定，本質上是關於歐洲的，同時因爲我們並不是凡爾賽條約的簽字國。常英國建議召請德國參加倫敦海軍會議時，法國表示假如邀請德國加入，法德就萊因區問題必須獲致協議，以及英法就互助問題必須獲致協議。</p>
<p>希特勒對於萊因區問題的討論，予以直截了當的解決，德軍於一九三六年三月七日，違背凡爾賽條約和羅加諾公約，佔領萊因區。那時候，倫敦會議正在草擬最後協定的內容。萊因的侵入是歐洲的一種發展，並不牽涉我們，華盛頓方面並不應該有所行動。但是，這顯然是走向戰爭的另一大踏步。三月九日，我發電給戴維斯，要他就歐洲所出現的新形勢以及可能牽涉美國的種種謠言或新聞，表示見解。我還說：「無論如何，我們毫無疑問地在走進歐局日益緊張的一個時期。」</p>
<p>至三月二十日，我們已把條約的最後草案送呈總統。</p>
<p>總統核准了這個條約，但是提出了一個建議。三月二十日，我們就把這個建議轉給戴維斯，其中說「戴維斯應表明一點，就是美國政府及其代表對於新條約中對於數量的（全部噸位）限制未能規定，深表遺憾。」</p>
<p>三月二十三日，我把總統的思想電告戴維斯，就是說戴維斯和史丹萊海軍上將應聯名向英國代表團團長艾登修函，「對於會議期間的相處情形表示愉快和感激，並借此提起一點，就是新條約猶如以前的海軍條約一般，並朱規定數量上的限制，我國政府希望在海軍建設方面避免和英國競爭；英帝國和美國應接受艦隊相等的辦法，作爲公認的確定的原則；目前的情形和環境證明兩國政府應繼續恪守艦隊相等的原則；恪守此項原則的結果將有助於兩國政府的友好關係和世界和平。」英國人是可以用同樣的口調答覆的。</p>
<p>此事方吿辦竣，新聞走漏立即隨之發生，於是英美海軍合作已成立「秘密協定」的各色新聞，到處紛傳。威爾遜公使從日內瓦吿訴我說，這個「走漏」，係出自出席倫敦會議的日本觀察員方面，他隨時由英方吿以機密的消息。因此，我們就準備把這兩封信一起發表。</p>
<p>一九三六年四月，當戴維斯從倫敦回來的時候，他和我曾就世界局勢進行長時間的談話。在我們的面前，呈現着一種重大的問題和責任，我國政府必須加以應付。它牽涉到一種確切的決定，就是說鑒於世界許多地區的混亂情形，我國根據實際情形，究竟應該在什麽時候放棄經由裁减軍備藉以維持和平的嘗試，而迅速開始充份武裝，俾能抵抗德日義顯然在走向軍事，征服方面去的行動。</p>
<p>十多年來，世界的傾向大體上是向着裁减軍備的方向走。但在最後幾年中，我們看到日本，德國和義大利的言行顯然透露出侵略的意向。我們看到這些國家違背一切裁减軍備的工作和每一種維護和平的條約。同時，我們看到瘋狂的毫無約束的軍備競爭，益以實行征服的喧鬧和無恥的威脅，而這些侵略國家，常然是此中要角。</p>
<p>當戴維斯和我討論這些發展時，一點是非常明顯的，就是要靠裁减軍備來維護和平，接近不可能。所以當時的問題，乃是奉公守法的國家爲了遏制迅速發展中的軍事侵略計劃，究竟能否作適當的合作，並且能够合作到什麼程度？但是，猶如衆所共知的，我們的政府事實上不得不忽視這一個可能維護和平的方法，其理由很簡單，就是與論方面大多數是强硬地甚至激烈地反對我們參與這一類的聯合行動。</p>
<p>美國一方面繼續勸導和推行和平，敦促各國—尤其是決心從事侵略各國—採取類似的政策，而另一方面的唯一辦法，就是立即注意侵略者的行動，並且武裝我國，不再遷延，俾達足以保障我國安全的程度。</p>
<p>一九三五年初，我已經把我的熱烈信念吿訴總統，就是說我們應趕快雞造一個更大的海軍，尤其爲了遠東的局勢，更不得不然。一九三五年一月廿二日，我送給他一個備忘錄，附以駐東京的格魯大使，所發的一個極好的報吿，其中把東方的展望分析得很淸楚，並附以國務院爲遠東問題而擬就的一份備忘錄。</p>
<p>國務院的備忘錄有一節說：「我們應該加緊努力，以謀擁有一個如此堅强的海軍，藉使其他國家中沒有一國敢眞正想來攻擊我們；我們應該表明，就是我國人民一方面不想作戰，也沒有攻擊任何其他國家的理田，同時不但不爲可以作戰而太驕傲，而在具備某種條件之下，將因不作戰而太驕傲」。</p>
<p>若干閣員爲國務卿會建議建造海軍而覺得奇怪。總統和我都很熟悉的一個朋友巴魯樞有一天對我說，總統對於我孜孜希望建造一個較大的海軍，深表驚奇。</p>
<p>一九三五年，我開始計劇怎樣積聚錫金屬，因爲錫是一種軍用原料，美國所產不多，而在戰爭一且發生之時，對於陸軍部和海軍部都是必要的。國務院的經濟顧問范斯和我一起草擬計劃，並且經由他，我把這個意思傳達給英大使林特賽並且把計劃放在他面前。其中的要點，就是英國應該獲得某一規定數額的錫，交給我國政府，其代價則可以劃入英國所欠我國債務的賬上。</p>
<p>林特賽把這個計劃硏究之後，在一九三五年六月六日來看我，並且說他已經把這個建議送到倫敦去了。</p>
<p>林特賽的神情極陰鬱。他說英國人民認爲債務已經了却，要英國政府獲得款項去償付移交給我們的錫，頗有困難。</p>
<p>我提醒大使說，世界上錫的主要供應是在英國首都的控制之下。少量的實物償付，猶如我們所建議的，可以復活以前的象徵償債辦法，並和這種辦法的精神相符合。以前，英國政府曾經很高興做過的，直到約翰生法案（Hiram　Johnson）的不幸影響發生之後，始吿停止。這一行動，對於我國人民對英國政府的觀念，可以產生良好的影響。</p>
<p>但是林特賽並不以爲這個建議甚至可爲英國外交部所接受。他是對的。倫敦來的答覆是完全拒絕。直到四年之後，即歐洲戰爭爆發的三個月前，我們方能和英國談妥了一個協定，規定以棉花交換橡膠和錫，如此，我們才開始積聚重要的軍用原料。</p>
<p>事實上，假如國務院這種努力能够像我們希望的這樣早和這樣充份地獲得成果，那麽戰爭在珍珠港發生時我們可以有充份的準備，而可使戰時的負擔大爲减輕。</p>

<h3>西安破獲　空運毒品巨案　搜出嗎啡一百卅兩兩主犯留北平辦貨</h3>
<p>〔本報西安二日航訊〕百年尾，西安突然破獲了一件空中運毒案，搜得嗎啡一百卅八兩，約計可値國幣二十億左右，在寒　的古城中，這事是動人聽聞的。尤其是空運由北平來陝，再加上市民的傳說渲染，就更熱鬧了。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的一元月廿八日深夜，駐防西安的憲兵十四團及警察保甲人員十多名，到小學習港（在西安西大街）呌開了十三號的門，那家住着一個　婦郭褚氏，她是河南溫縣人，年屆半百，來陝已有四年，據她們的鄰居說，平常郭褚氏是以織布爲業的。但是當警憲到她家的那晚，的確當塲搜出了嗎啡五袋，重達一百十四兩，連同毒品，她也被捕了。</p>
<p>在同一晚上，西安據　商的中心地民生市塲也有三個人被捕，這些人都是以　設布擬爲名。都是河南人。其由　好智，係郭褚氏的堂弟、０另一個犯人褚淸西，也是他的本家。他們件被捕之前，在其住處，經　警人員搜出嗎啡一袋，重廿四兩。據說當憲警到達褚的住處時，只有　浦西于人在家，經　法後，供稱褚好智興一個呌郭道淸者，在國民市塲宿妓未返，於是警憲馳往，二人就逮。同時在此二人的身種搜出嗎啡樣品二小包</p>
<p>所謂郭道淸者，係亦氏</p>
<p>瓜葛親戚</p>
<p>平常和　家同業及親戚關係，時相過從。當時有客名　養來，　德禮二人者，出入商場，舉止　綽，狀如大賈。　等　其行動，時與談，日久以後，漸成莫逆之交，稱兄道弟，頗為熱絡。惟二　對他們自己的身勞家事一直　莫如深，不與人說這些。他們之間的　係，完全是金錢與酒肉。</p>
<p>過從至密後，二薛乘機與　　談及</p>
<p>致富之術</p>
<p>乃說出平運每至西安，　獲巨利。每販運一次，起碼可獲二倍以上的利　，褚郭等人，是以發財爲目的，見有此機會，自然不肯喊輕放過。又經二薛之巧言誘導，心下大悅。當即決定集股經營，每股五千萬元，共集得五億國幣。乃由二薛飛往北平購辦，首批毒品於新年前後運到，依最初決定，交由郭媼姊弟保管。</p>
<p>憲十四團早在</p>
<p>首批毒品</p>
<p>運到時，就已獲代情報，本來想在二薛把第二批毒品運到後，一網打盡，不料自上月廿二日後遇天雪，寒琉逼人，西安因氣壓關係，航機暫停起落。憲兵當局恐怕久則生變，於是把褚郭諸犯先行捕逮。（另外有一種說法謂：被搜出之此批毒品，日前諸犯頗有意運往　州，因而促近了憲兵當局之破案日子）。</p>
<p>犯人四名</p>
<p>獲之毒品全部函轉西安市政府，並將人犯連同口供轉解長安地方法院。該院於一月卅一日，首次開審。郭褚氏對法官供稱：在其寓處査出毒品是實，惟這些東西係同鄕薛義來在六七天以前暫寄放於其家者，她自己當時並未發覺爲何物，故不曾留心。繼對薛本人現在何處，推稱「不知道」·褚淸西則供稱：和他相來往者，尙有籍啓榮，當他被捕押至市塲時，曾遙見　啓榮遁走，下文不詳。</p>
<p>這件寒十現在只發展到爲止，長安地方法院將依法究辦。據西安一家晚報載：據破案之負責人稱：「該案牽連頗廣，漏網者決嚴予……」（記者張　洲）</p>

<h3>陝南城固縣參會秘書　陳珍珊遭暗殺　縣長孟若洞等涉嫌被拘</h3>
<p>〔本報寳鷄一日航訊〕陝南去年是多難年代，鎭安血案，轟動了全國，縣長孫濬伯尙在獄中事猶未了，而城固縣參議會之秘書陳珍珊，又在新年前，彼人暗殺。這事件雖在月前發生，然而因爲城固和西安，遠　關山，所以一般人還不知道。</p>
<p>去年冬天十二月廿二晚九時，城固縣議會秘書陳珍珊，在其寓所被人暗殺，據城固縣警察局的調査，當時的兇手有七八名，身着黃色呢服，有一個曾喊稱：「老子名呌吳珍」，據說陳之住所還是在縣城中心區。</p>
<p>陳珍珊是縣議會的秘書，據說和縣黨部關係很好，他之所以能出任縣議會的秘書，也多得力於黨部之助。在陳未死之前數月，一度曾聯合該縣各參議員，由他自己領銜，控吿該縣縣長孟若侗，派「不整項」達十三億之數，當時頗開罪於孟縣長。慘案　生的晚上，孟縣長到鄕下去視察工事去了，和他同行的是縣靑年團負責人余仙洲及地方治安首長。因此，在事後就有猜測，孟縣長與余幹事長之避出，與此案，可能有文章可作，</p>
<p>據陳秘書的妻子，在慘案發生後。向警察局報吿時，曾稱：「她的的丈夫在被殺之前，曾向她概嘆　城固環境之惡劣，幷且吿訴她，最　有人要謀害他，而主謀者就是縣長孟若侗和靑年團余仙洲幹事長。」至於陳與該二人有何　隙，一般的傳說，又纏上了立塲問題，因爲陳是黨方人物，所以在普選時，當然學對自己的立塲及朋友帮忙，因此遭人嫉恨頗深。</p>

<p>陝省六區專員公署，在事變之後，即展開偵察，并捕捉嫌疑犯，先後被管押者有城固警察局科長羅天合，保警隊長連城　，余幹事長　徵兵雷明與及余幹事長本人。孟縣長也被拘於南鄭專員公署，而余　衛兵雷明興在由城固被押解往南鄭地方法院時，曾自　自的說：「殺人終是要償命！」本來傳說是　稽的，而加上了事後的這些　置，蛛祕馬跡，難免使人想起了那些傳說。</p>
<p>上月十七日，南鄭地方法院，開首次偵察庭，　集證據，由問理由，幷傳訊了十一個證人，由有城固警局的局長，督察長，警長，警士。在這些人口供申，大半都　露出這案事實上和被拘押者都有關係。</p>
<p>該警察局長說：「羅天合，連城　，都是孟縣長帶去的私人，孟縣長前曾成立有一個「行動組」，羅，連二人和一個組員王文德，是其中的主幹。現在，王文德是　走了」。而出事之夜的崗警也說曾在事件未發生之前，看見羅天合與王文德在陳宅附近徘徊。事剛發生後，羅回到警局，神態不安。事後，　局曾接到過一封匿名信，內有警句：「殺人者惡，被殺者亦惡」！這兩句話羅天合在辦公室中，也曾經無意由說過。至於連城　他本來是保警隊的隊長，可是從未到過隊，但那天晚上突然破例的回到隊裏去，而且據說當時出是　色倉　，舉止失常。</p>
<p>在已經行憲的今天，這件事的發生是不幸的，然而法律是尊嚴的，不容放過，陝省當局在法院受理此案之際，已派員協助法院偵察，不久的將來，一定會水落石出，眞象大白的。（記者靑木）</p>
<p>證人之一的警察局督察長的口供，是重要的。他供稱有兩件事値得注意：　孟縣長與陳珍珊有淸算不敷款之仇隙，羅，連二人雖與陳無仇隙，而他兩人是縣長的私人。　城固老百姓之傳說，雖不足作證，而可能從流言中聽出綫索，請法庭注意此點。</p>

<h3>印度史網要</h3>
<p>— 魯元</p>
<p>李志純編著　正中書局出版</p>
<p>印度與國毗鄰，同時均有文明古國之稱；不論在渦去或現在，其在歷史上，和我國有許多相同處。中印文化之溝通，也比任何其他一國來得早，根據中書上記載，在二千年以前，中印文化即開始交流。而在這二千年以來，　印二國一向保持　友誼關係，從沒有敵對過；縱觀世界歷史，可謂一件奇事。</p>
<p>近些年來，中印關係日趨密切，我們關心着印度局面底發展，而印度人士也同樣關心着我們中國，抗戰期間，蔣主席訪印與尼赫魯來華，均含有重大意義。國內關於印度問題論著，散見於報章雜誌者甚多，大都偏重於目前問題底探討，而罕有將印度歷史作一有系統底介紹；因爲編一部史警是件極不容易的事，何况在第二次世界大戰之後，世界文化慘遭浩刧，而印度民族又對於其本身歷史向不注重，所以使印度歷史之　集更感困難。國內沒有一部較完善的印度史書出現，不是歷史家們不注意印度歷史，實由於沒有完整印度史料供給他們去編寫。最近正中書局出版李志純編著的「印度史綱」一書，覺得有介紹的價値。</p>
<p>李著「印度史綱」，是參考牛津印度史敎本，與他旅印硏究心得編著而成。本書內容應富，文筆通俗流暢，自不待言；作者並能以演繹底方法逐步分析印度歷史上底種種因素，而後再以歸納方法予以討論，俾使讀者在閱讀此書之後，即能對印度過去現在與未來，均有一番新底瞭解與臆測。</p>
<p>印度民族非常複雜，但主要的可分雅利安與塔米爾南北二大系。印度民族已經有四五年有記戰底歷史，但在此四五年中，他們各民族從沒有團結過，過去如此，現在還是如此。因爲民族間底裂痕，造成印度悲慘的命運；他們整個歷史中，除了雅利安爲印度人曾建立過印度人的印度之後，幾乎一向就被外人統治至今，作者在本書中很明白地叙述到，這田於印度民族不團結底「印度病」致成的。</p>
<p>印度文化，在過去燦爛一時，但這些優越底文化，到現在還未曾被歐洲人士重視與領悟。歐洲人士目光下的印度，祗是一個無文化的野　民族，這種錯誤而帶有侮辱性底看法，惟有我們中國人能替她申辯，正如作者所說：祗有我們中國人瞭解與體味到眞正的印度文化，一個中國赤足的僧徒比英國的士紳們瞭解印度文化，更來得透澈。這種見解是很正確的。</p>
<p>印度經過許多次戰爭底摧殘，但她底四五千年的文化仍能保留下來，道有賴於宗敎力量，印度敗於戰塲，而未敗於文化，印度國土中雖然諸邦族分散不團結，但她有着統一的文化，無形中能使各邦族慢慢地趨於團結。現在印度獨立了，邦族間底鬥爭仍尖銳地進行着，但已有不少的印度人十，正在爲着這「印度病」而努力，相信不久的印度，正如作者所說，他們會造成一個完整底國家米。</p>
<p>作者把全書分爲五篇三十三草，約有十二萬言，他把印度歷史劃爲五個時期：</p>
<p>一，史前時期：指印度文化之有史可考以前時期，或謂印度土　等族的文化時期。</p>
<p>二，占史時期：即吠陀時期及與度敎教王朝時期。</p>
<p>三，中史時期：阿富汗人及回族統制時期。</p>
<p>四，近史時期；裝古人人生印度的蒙　兒帝國時期。</p>
<p>五，現史時期：以歐人之東來，度滅亡而到民族自覺復國時期。</p>
<p>在此五時期中，作者對古史之閘述尤爲詳細，因爲古史代是印度文化及社會一切制度確立的時候，在古史期中，我們可以探究到印度文化的淵源。在現代史中，作者把英國統治下的印度及復國運動一章省略了。現在印度獨立旗幟已經高　，復國運動可算吿一段落，爲全書完起見，希望作者能在再版時補寫進去。</p>
<h3>心理衛生論叢</h3>
<p>— 黃時樞</p>
<p>瓚著商務印書館版</p>
<p>著者用流利的文筆，從各方面討論心理衛生的功用與重要，提倡心理衛生。他的能度是科學的。每一問題必要從個案硏究着手，下結論時必要縝密，他論歐美人與由國人血壓高低的差異，便是一個例十。我們自然不以爲他的見解完全使人贊同。譬如，他解釋一個對家庭不滿　靑年的暈倒是表示對父親的抗議。常然我們不能說一定是不可能的，我們且承認暈倒使這靑年，應付了當時的情境，但似乎不必一定說這是對父親抗議。我們解，能「足够」便可不必「渦頭」，能用較普通　解釋，便不必更尋較曲折的解釋。</p>
<p>著者反對將一切諉諸遣傳，「因爲這是懶　而不負責的辦法」。順便說起，將一切諉諸遣傳有些像某類哲學家一切歸因於上帝一樣。到後來不僅成了「垃圾箱」，而且相常糢糊，空泛，成了個神秘的東西了。</p>
<p>他不偏頗。他要「從傳統的宗派的偏見與誤解由解放出來」（頁五）。在「近代醫事心理學的發展一一文中，他給與弗洛伊特（Freud）一個相當公允的估價。他承認弗洛伊特的學說與方法之限度，以爲弗洛伊特過分强調生物性的本能，忽視了文化環境對於人類行爲的規範作用，對於發展的概念多少停留在機械的解　上。但他指出弗洛伊特的學說並不是如有些人所說的，全是玄思冥想，而是實證的臨診經驗的結晶。弗洛伊特發現了下意識作用在人類行爲——特別是病態行爲中的動力的機能，放齊了精神病態硏究巾片面的偏向於身體研究的傳統而轉向於心理方面的了解，發現了兒童時期的重要性，而提供了發展的硏究方法</p>
<p>著者在他處亦說過「人類還不祗是生理的，同時還是心理的，要把人類生理現象，脫離了心理因子的影嚮而作孤立的研究，也是不够科學的，所以說人類健康是身心統一的，不可分割的」。他又表示「不滿意用簡單的刺激與反應（S．R）的公式來解釋人類行爲」，因爲「它忽略了反應者認識作用中主動的積極的機能和刺激本身所附着的社會與文化上的意義，而這些機能與意義不僅是決定了人們反應的內容，並且是人類由認識環境而至變革環境的主要動力。」</p>
<p>他　重環境，以爲遣傳「不過供給了一種發展的可能趨向，我們還可以用人力來改造這種趨向喲！」他注意文化的因素。這集子由到處可見。他以爲一個人格的形成，有三個因素。一是個人的生物機構，二是文化的要求，三是個人吸收文化的選擇過程。</p>
<p>因爲著者重視文化因素的緣故，所以他不但指出許多病往往是心理因素造成的，而且以爲精神病與文化因素有關，要心理衛生，必先改造文化。這見解救們極其贊同。從裏心理衛生工作者，若不認淸這一前提，則對不少精神病的原因與治療途徑，便不能够把握。著者固然表示過他重視兒童期的生活經驗，但他認爲要瞭解病癥的意義，「應瞭解患者整個的人格構造和患病當時的經過」。</p>
<p>他說，「我們袛就我們所發現的專實，作忠實的描寫和它的因果的探究，我們不把部份的事實作爲　限制的普遍的引申」。譬如，同樣的病癥，其病源不同，倘若我們自一個案硏究所得的結論，無限制地應付到一切有類似病徵的個案，便要發生錯誤了。心理衛生個案的事實與結論，所以不能無限制的普遍化和引用，是由於各個人的生活經驗，都不相同的緣故。不過多少有近似的地方，所以心理衛生的個案，還是有參考價値的。</p>
<p>從上述的立塲，他研究了「父子之道」，「男女之間」等等問題。他說：「沒有心理上有問題。父母，決沒有行爲上有問題的兒童」。關於「男女之間」的文章，本書中有好幾篇。他指出道問題「不僅靑年們婚前生活中非常重要，就是在婚後的家庭生活中，男女們心理上的適應問題，依然是不能忽視的」。他分析了「靑年人的徬徨」，女子對男子的敵視等等。總之，性的問題異常重要。「性在我們這個社會中，很早就成爲一種禁忌（Taboo），經渦神權思想和封建道德又替它加上一重神秘的外衣。於是人們對它不能像其他身體機能一樣的容易得着科學的認識。但它確是人們身體機能的一個部分，並且是影嚮人們身心發展的比較重要的一個部分，事實也是逼着人們得去處理這個機能所引起的許多問題的。於是，糢糊的了解，好奇的暗中摸索，社會禁忌的罪惡爲，宗敎上的不潔感都繼結着造成人們情緒上的不安，這就是性問題影響心理健康的癥結所在。所以現在廓淸性問題的神秘性，讓科學智識來帮助我們合理的處理性機能所引起的問題，這在我國教育設施中是應該特別加以注意的。</p>
<p>我們所以要研究這些問題，是爲了使人人心理健全。治療精神病患者的「主要的目標，即在使患者得到合理的健全的方法來回復他心理的平衡。」「心理衡生硏究的對象是人們在現實生活中日積月累而發展成的病態心理現象，所以它特別强調整個的人類心理歷程和人們所生活的社會文化環境的研究。」</p>
<p>總之，「心理衛生論叢」是本有見解亦有用的書。對心理學有興趣的人可以看看，靑年們父母們亦不妨看着。心理衛生極其重要。不少社會問題往往是個人心理病態的問題。希望別的同類性質的書，源源不絕而來。</p>
<h3>編者小言</h3>
<p>— 統先</p>
<p>甘地先生的被刺，這消息驚震了全世界。印度這個民族多少總帶一點神秘性。爲了我們希望對於印度有一深切的瞭解，本期特爲介紹一本關於印度歷史的書，希望讓者注意。近來還有兩件引人注意的事情，一件是同濟的學生由罷課而請願，而至吳市長被毆；一件是上海的舞女由開會而請願，而至社會局被搗。前者有關於靑年的修養，後者有關於　衆的心理。所以我們又介紹「心理衛生」一書書作爲大家修養和研究的參考。</p>
<p>從最近許多的來稿中我們發現一件可喜的事，即介紹科學數理和史地書籍的文章很多，讀者也可從最近幾期的出版界著到這個事實。我們仍希望國內的學者和科學家們多多爲我們介紹國外最新的科學名著。相反的，我們又覺得介紹文藝作品的好稿子太少了，我們希望文藝作家們多多給我們介紹優良的文藝書籍</p>
<p>中國的寫作家有一個氣習，往往以被人家拉稿爲榮。這一點，本人不贊成。特別像我們這一類介紹書籍的刋物，有嚴譽的作家應該以指導後進或互相交換知識爲天職。我們不向有　譽的作家拉稿，但是我們很希望他們自動的把他們所讀到的好書給我們介紹，以公諸同好，或輔導靑年進修。</p>
<h3>評介「中國憲法大綱」</h3>
<p>— 葉秋原</p>
<p>（　玉坤編著，中華書局出版，全書三一萬字，定價九元。）</p>
<p>一九四八年一月份「外交季刊」，　有美國研究中國史　者馬洛（GeogeW．Mollory）所撰「中國新憲法「一文，對於我國剛剛實施的新憲法，稱道備至，他一開頭就說：「一九四六年十二月廿五日由國國民大會所通過的新憲法，已於一九四七年十二月廿五日實施，這一部新憲法實爲最民主　憲法，以視一般人士所　料　，　要民主化，因爲國的一部制憲史，不知遭受多少次　挫折。」但是他又在結論一段　說：「　於一九四七年的　　，可知最近數　來　　　政治理論方面，已獲有長　進步；推行政不作違大而澈底的改新，那末這部新憲法也不過是一種美麗的其文而已。」</p>
<p>我們研究各國的憲法，深知各有各的優點，同時也知，各有各的缺點，這爲政治制度，沒有絕對的優劣，只有比較好壞，但是最重要的，乃在切實易行。以言我國新憲法，不要說國內的政治學家，一致　美；就是世界各國的政治學者，只要洞悉我國政情的，也無不承認這是一部民主的進步的憲法，如果這一百七十五條眞能條條實行，那末我國憲政常有光明的前途。所以目前的問題，已不在憲法的優劣，而在憲法能否切實施行了。</p>
<p>所謂憲法，是全國上下一體遵行的國家根本大法，不僅要政府切實施行，而且還要全國人民，個個能明瞭憲法的內容，人人能洞悉法精神。這樣眞正的憲才能實現。但是我國有四萬五千萬口，文盲佔着極大的百分比，就是　知文學人，對於憲，也根本不知其爲何物，我們怎樣能希望全國老百姓人人都能遵守憲法呢？有人說，我們對於民主憲政，可謂在開始學習的階段，唯有在　習　求地步。這說法，我們完全同感，但是學習民主，學習憲政，最重要的一步，乃在明瞭我國新憲法的內容及其精神。</p>
<p>我國出版界對於憲法的著作，琳琅滿日，美不勝收，但適宜於大學敎水及一般參考的，還不多見；最近　華書局出版　坤先生著「巾國憲法大網」一書，似乎有介紹與本報讀者的價値。讀書共三十萬字，分十一章：　緒論；　中國制憲史的追溯；　由國憲法起草之經過；　抗戰期問的憲政運動；　政治協商會議的前後；　國民大會的召開與制憲工作之完成；　中國憲法的精神；　　央政制；　地方制度；　人民權利與義務；　　憲法的施行及修正；　　附錄中華民國憲法。</p>
<p>這部著作的特色甚多，因限於烯幅，不能詳述，但其最重耍者有二。第一，對於我國制憲的經過，作者站在客觀的立塲，作不偏不倚的叙述；從政治協商會議起，一直到國大制定憲法，均有詳盡的記載，可以常作近代中國政治史讀。第二，作者對於憲法的理論硏究有素，尤其熟悉各國的政治制度，故以世界各國憲政的理論與實際，來說明我國憲法的特質，格外覺得淸楚。要之，這部書是値得向讀者推　的。</p>
<h3>化學精華</h3>
<p>— 李梯石</p>
<p>（吳瑞年著中華書局出版）</p>
<p>理化敎本極多，但綜合複習性的書本極少，問有一二，大都僅事收集習題，予以解答，就稱作是複習用的書本。化學在各門科學中，是最繁複應雜的一門，一般敎本當然不乏系統井然叙述曉明者，不過由於化學取材的範　實在太廣，學讀上是很感困難的，這一本「化學精華」確是截至目前爲止，稱得上有價値的輔助書，用以複習參考旣屬恰當，並且還可當作一本簡明的化學辭典，學生們於讀化學之餘，看本書可得一明晰的輪廓，於學化學不無補助。</p>
<p>本書的編制，是作者吳瑞年先生獨創的，它丟棄了普通的形式次序，用歸納綜合德方法，分爲六部。其第一部係定義。定律·別名等的解釋，凡是化學上的定義定律按羅馬字的次序排列，分予釋解，其中別名的解釋，他書不多見，　講爲本書一特色，所謂別名，就是我們日常所稱的那些化工製造品，如火酒·瀝青·電石等俗名，釋以英文名稱，並詳予說明，外列以化學分子式，這一部份已脫離課堂範團，而進入日常生活　，是較令人感到興趣的。</p>
<p>第二部是非金屬及其化合物，以同價元素歸入一類，又以單節叙述各個別原素或化合物，這一部分的特色是着重「價」的合併，即凡同價元素即合在一起是。第三部是金屬元素，以金屬所屬族性分其次序，同族之元素歸入一起再行分節叙之。第四部有機化合物，也以同類歸聚分叙。</p>
<p>第五部化學離解，乃由作者自擬的問答題，按其形式上的不同，分爲區別問題，叙述問題：…等七類，各予解答，嚴格說來，此項習題之解答，供作參考自有用處，然揆諸全書體例，這部分實不必要的，有之，不爲本書增色，去之，也非學者之損失·</p>
<p>第六部化學計算，也分成六種不同種之化學計算，各再舉例示明，這　面所收的習題，嫌太簡單，與其前面之內容不甚相稱，學者是不感到滿足的，但其分類詳書簡明，答解尤明晰，供中學生參考，綽綽有餘。</p>
<p>本書第一部定義定律別名的解釋，在目下化學醫中不多見，足可當化學辭典參可，甚有用外，其第二第三兩部叙述各元素，也極簡單，作者用快刀斬麻的手段，各分「發現」，「存在」，「製法」，「性質」和「用途」諸條，按條予以解釋，直截了當，這是很可稱道的。在一般學生的應付考試言，第五第六兩部自予相常便利，但就價値言，要以前四部爲大，尤其第一部別名之解釋，參以中間兩部的原素，簡直可以常作自學或常識讀本，允爲本書的最大價値。</p>
<p>本書不滿意的地方也有，就是化學理論的缺少，這在作者說，他已經把它歸入第一部，名稱之解釋中去了，但是包括在定義，定律和別名的解釋中，是不能令人感到滿足的，尤其較高深的理論，本書絕無不分部的理由。</p>
<p>這本書的編制，在化學書的出版上，應是一個嘗試，是一個進步的嶄新的改革和創造，値得大家硏究提倡。按照這種體例，希望有　詳較高深而完備的化學「精華」出版，以供中等學校以上的學生用。</p>
<h3>讀「鳳儀園」</h3>
<p>— 野萍</p>
<p>施濟美著　大衆出版社出版</p>
<p>作者在她的「跋」　，虛心的說「……鳳仙花開了，沒有香氣，花朵兒又不好看，顏色也不美；但是爲了自個兒親手種的原故，遂有點兒偏愛……在母親的樟木衣箱裏，還珍藏着我們幼年時節穿過的虎頭鞋，紅細上　着籃梅和翠爲的小棉襖，已經破舊了，父親買的士耳其小帽子，也戴壞了，洗得泛白的童子軍服……這些，早就沒用了，該扔了，還留着着爲什麼呢？就是不小氣，至少也透看幾分傻氣，但是，還留着爲什麽呢？也許就爲着這一點點兒傻氣，有時候，我想像這笨重的樟木衣箱是一個水晶也似的記憶實盒，在這裘銷着多少　昨天，和昨夜的月亮，太陽，星星，和年華，於是，這些無用的應該拋棄的東西，在一刹那間，忽又覺得珍貴起來，正像藏着這些破舊的衣裳一樣，正像留下那微賤的鳳仙花一樣，我極惶恐而又極靦　的整理了「鳳儀園」的稿子」，－「鳳儀園」是施濟美的第一本集子，其中包括十個短篇小說，兩個中篇。</p>
<p>正像她的詩意而又美麗的「跋」一樣，她的每一篇小說也全如此，她的歡愉和好尚是詩意的，她得感傷也是美麗的，所以她的小說近乎散文，甚至是詩，讀「鳳儀園」之後的第一感，就是作者不應該是小說家，如果她從事於詩和散文的創作，將會有更深的造就成功。</p>
<p>從寫作的技巧上說：「鳳儀園」是最成功的一篇精密的結構，細膩的描寫，華美的文藻，神秘的色彩，在在都把握住讀者的情緒，「三年」和「愛的勝利」是兩篇動人的故事，只是有點落俗套的安排，作者在這裏發揮了較多的自我理想：高尚的同情心，和偉大的自我犧牲，「紫色的罌粟花」也是如此，但是人物的刻重於故事的叙述，所以雖無離奇曲折的情節，反更娓　動人，同樣注重於個性描寫的還有「秦淋流」和「小不　兒」，最可愛的是「小二的惆悵」，「尋夢人」徹頭徹尾是一首散文詩，「藍天使「描寫一個愛虛榮的女孩子的心理，「痴人的喜悅」叙述窮敎師的淸苦生活，「大地之春」以農村爲背景，可以是一篇好的創作，只是讀來感覺文字中缺少一種泥土氣息，大概由於作者生活場境隔膜所致。</p>
<p>「鳳儀園」裘每一篇作品都是年靑的，是年靑的光華，却不是年靑的光和熱，作者的筆觸，像輕柔的吉他，不像瞭亮的號角；像舒徐的淸流，不像怒吼的海洋；又如同一問明窗凈几，纖　不染的房屋，擺了鮮花，古玩，高雅的山水古書，却沒有掃帶，抹布一類的東西，這些骯體，討人厭的什物，但有時候又是必需的，「……他們都是夢想多於現實，他們能創造絕美的海市蜃樓，卻很少有豐功偉業，他們具有生活的藝術，卻沒有生活的常識，他們都會「聞弦歌而知雅意」，却不能「聞鷄起舞」……」也許「鳳儀園」裏馮太太的話，就是最好的形容。</p>
<p>雖然，我們並不因此以爲作者　廢，作品空虛，相反的，只覺得作者坦白超然，她的作品純　熟誠，因爲她將自己靈魂最純眞的一而獻給讀者，沒有做作，沒有矜持，雖然缺乏一種飛揚的力量，但是並不無病呻吟，對現實雖不滿意，却也不拘悲觀；她永不灰心的夢寐着海市蜃樓，似乎努力要創造一個柏拉圖的烏托邦，或是陶淵明的桃花源，她有許冬朋友，志同道合的人，她相信這夢想有一天會成功，作者似乎有這稱樂觀，至於那些不是朋友的人，桃花源以外的事，她並不是職不知，却一概淡然視之，莫然處之。</p>
<p>所以年青的人喜愛她的作品，尤其是一麋不染的年靑人，喜愛的自然是她的優點，華美的文彩，詩意的氣氛，純眞的理想……但是，更爲年靑人所喜的卻是她的弱點：她的渴念和不安，對人世的溫情，對夢想的熱愛，她的單純的心田和深刻的哲理，她的坦白而又神秘，熟誠而又孤獨，堅强而又怯弱的靈魂，以及她的對人對事的矛盾看法，她的弱點比她的優點更能够握住年靑人的情感，因爲她和他們一樣的一塵不染，他們想說的，要說的就是這些，而她已爲他們寫出了。</p>

<h3>跳舞與婚姻</h3>
<p>— 王考</p>
<p>近日因中央明令解散　塲，頗引起　業的非議，彼此是非，且不談他，現在堤供一個材料，未嘗不可以算是有趣的：</p>
<p>胡　之博士的留學日記卷三，民國三年一月四日有一條：「吾國女子所處地位高於西方女子」云：（原書第一册頁一五四）「忽念吾國女子所處地位，實高於西方女子，吾國顧全女子之廉恥名節，不令　婚姻之　自累，皆由父母主之，男子生而爲之室，女子生而爲之家。女子無須尸婚姻之故自獻其身於社會交際中，僕僕焉自求其耦，所以重女子之人格也。西方則不然，女子長成，即以求耦爲事，父母乃　習音樂，嫻舞蹈，然後令出而與男子周旋。其能取悅於男子，或能以術驅男子入其彀中者，乃先得耦；其太强樸訥，或不甘自辱以媚人者，乃終身不字爲老女。是故　女子之人格，驅之以自獻其身以釣取男子之鞦心者，西方婚姻自由之罪也、」下面緊接着又說：「此論或過激，然自信不爲無據，覘　於其精微者，當不斥爲頑固守舊也。」</p>
<p>以上雖然是代表了覘到「精　之處的胡先生早期偉論，實　亦不能首肯，至少胡先生是學」學的，通邏輯的，這種以部分—甚至是一點—而代表全體的說　，不能說不是陷於謬誤。原書　二册說到「靴范縝神滅論」的　　，即有犯了同等錯誤而經胡　　指出的，此足見胡氏非不知，而是故作矯情之論也。中國婦　　不去跳舞，不去交際，就算　　高，那麽「內言不出於闈，　　不入於　」，「男女授受不　」也都須尊爲重視女子才行，　　引申，男子娶妾，女千專作　　傳後之機器；又何嘗不可以二如此說法呢？我們也正不必奇，稍後一些的林語堂先生在「　息京華」中就說過纏小脚的美　原則，以及納妾之家庭和諧論　。不過林氏的目的是炫奇，而　　後的指歸是使自己的著述成　Best　sellers之一，其爲Pract　calism也，不無可以原諒之處，　氏之說，殆又不如是，蓋他　婚姻是舊式的，母親代定，胡　孝母，不忍離異，乃作此阿Q　的自己欺騙耳。同書第二册有　　段諭婚姻問題的，都曾提到　已不離婚的理由，可以爲證。</p>
<p>求耦乃是生物的要求，初不　於人類。孔雀見雌而開屛，鳴　父尾而作聲，這裏面沒有什麼　廉恥名節」的問題，胡先生那　　康乃爾學農，不難已明此理。能如所云，古人所說的「女爲　已者容」一語，豈不大有罪惡　　國古時亦復有跳無求耦之俗，　便是詩經鄭風的湊洧，「士　　方秉藺兮」「唯士與女，伊　相　，贈之以勺藥」。和今日　人跳月之風，恐亦不會相去多　，至於把女人關在家裏，只許　人「相親」，願意討那個就討　個，願意娶多少就娶多少，完　是男性中心社會成立之後　病　。</p>
<p>回到本題，　　　　　跳舞與婚姻的關係，起初並不是像胡　生所說那樣連帶到道德的，然　　德並不是一成不變的，生物　的物事，可以山社會把他轉人道上的搗　，給大人先生們了樂，還要打擊一些可　蟲落　。—事實上，跳舞恐怕不但是號稱爲「憐香惜玉」之流的消遣，而且也正是「特符綰節」者流樂而忘倦的頑意兒。至於討男人歡喜，以自附爲婚姻的話，在中國，却是還沒有那麽高貴的東西呢！說也可憐。</p>
<h3>記性</h3>
<p>— 陳學玲</p>
<p>「爲什麽你的手帕上有一個結？」</p>
<p>「我的妻子要我記得去替她寄一封信。」</p>
<p>「那末你寄了沒有？」</p>
<p>「沒有，她忘記把信交給我了。」</p>
<h3>知足常樂</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>「知足常樂」是一句我國歷來沿用，認爲順撲不破的至理名言。並且也許正是我們的國粹和公認的絕妙處世哲學，記得我鄕有首民謠：「騎馬意氣揚，趕驢懶洋洋，却待回首看，還有步行人。」便是呌人萬事退一步着想的意思。</p>
<p>這眞是再也聰明不過的說法，趕　的見了步行人，當然覺得趾高氣揚，不可一世，而步行的人雖然走得汗流浹背，但如果和那馱着人跑的馬相較，却又覺得聊堪自慰，不再羨慕騎馬的和趕　的了，即使是被人跨在胯下的馬，想到自己的主人比　子的主人顯赫威風，便也不由得忘了辛勞，有些飄飄然起來，「比上不足，比下有餘」。根據這一套邏輯，趕　的以趕　爲足，步行的以步行爲足，馬　牲畜以被人騎爲足，於是騎馬的自可放開繩繩，加上一鞭而無慮其他了。</p>
<p>知足常樂最好的例子，便是孔老夫子的得意高足顏回，「一簞食，一瓢飮，在陋巷，人不堪其憂，回也不减其樂。」顏回的忍耐工夫，可眞高人一等，不然，怎能够在衣食住的物質條件如此窘迫下，却甘之若飴，怡然自得？何况「禹思天下有溺者，猶已溺之也，稷思天下有飢者，猶己飢之也。」聖賢人有憂天下之心，常然應該先大下憂而憂，後犬下樂而樂，春秋時代同然比現在宇內紛爭好些，可是諸侯頻起戰亂，也巳經不及大同小康，除顏回之外，不但簞食瓢飲的一定很多，連簞食瓢飲都够不上的恐也不在少數。顏回能够安居於陋巷者，或許也是體味了知足常樂的個中三昧，自孔子以下，歷來都把顏回名列賢人，而其所被尊爲賢人者，就因爲他能够謹守住簞食瓢飲，對王公卿相們的豐衣美食，視若棄屣，而大言「可取而代之」的項羽，便不免被詬爲匹夫之勇不足以成大器的了。</p>
<p>被人打了耳光，譬如不留心自己跌一交；三餐喝些粥湯，譬如路旁凍屍；亭子間回不轉身，譬如過街樓下的呌化；不幸嗚呼哀哉，譬如父母沒有生我。如果你有了這種偉大的知足精神，凡事達觀，便能永登極樂，而子子孫孫，也將贊你一聲「賢哉賢哉」了。</p>
<h3>解甲以後</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>去年十二月間，在緬甸戰役殉國的英雄戴安瀾將軍的靈櫬，由戴夫人親自跋涉遠途，伴送回籍安葬。不想戴將軍身後肅條，竟至戴夫人因爲路費拮据，飄零異鄕，英靈固不能早日入土爲安，生者竟亦致　飱不繼！那時，筆者曾於百感交集之餘，在自由談發表一　名呌「何以慰先烈」的小文。此後雖聞即有熱心愛國之士，慨然相助，使戴將軍得以早安　　，但從此我就立志願，要搜集一點資料，看看別的國家裏對解甲歸田的戰士們如何安頓，對陣亡將士的遺族是如何撫卹。</p>
<p>最近看到了幾篇來源極可靠的文章，眞不禁感慨與慚愧交併！中國的將士們何嘗不能奮勇殺敵，置生命於度外！而看看別人家對將士們的愛護，却實在覺得我們太對不起我們的抗日勇士們了。說起對士兵們的愛　備至，我們往往先想起美國，美國的士兵們祗要服役滿六十日，退伍時就可得二百美元的遺散費，如果曾在海外工作，可得三百元。照我們官價外匯計算，也就有二三千萬元可供應用—而美國一般的物價當然還是比我國低。但是，事實上美國對退伍士兵的待遇和別的國家比較之下，竟還是差得太遠！</p>
<p>待士兵們最好的恐怕倒是蘇聯。士兵們每在軍隊　服役滿一年，退伍時就可以得到一全年的「恩餉」，換言之，當過了五年兵的戰士，在復員時就由政府給予相當於五年軍餉總額的解散費。但紅軍的薪餉實在很低，一年的恩餉總額也爲數無幾。可是蘇聯的政策却有一大特色，它能够保證在一個月內爲每一個退伍士兵找到一個待遇極優　的　業，而這一個新職的薪水，更絕對比那位士兵在從軍前工作時所得的薪金爲高。對于解決退伍士兵的居住問題，蘇聯的制度也是特別設想周到的，從開戰時起，政府對全國所造的新房屋新公寓，早有通盤　劃預先留下百分之十，給退伍士兵或陣亡將士的　族居住。如戰士們本來有好的家庭，而在戰爭中被砲火破壞了，那麽政府就免費供給他所費一切木料，另外給予一筆相當於二千美元左右的貸款，專供營繕。</p>
<p>英國比蘇聯稍爲差一點，士兵們退伍時各得四十九美元的「治裝費」，專供他們裁製常服之需。任何服役滿三年（其中至少兩年須在海外）的士兵，如已娶妻生子，就可另外支用四百七十五美元的津貼；若是少尉階級，則可以動用一筆一千三百美元的款項。</p>
<p>要據美國政府規定，退伍士兵得向政府申請二千至四千美元的長期低利貸款，以供建屋敎育等費用，但是比之新西蘭，却又自愧不如。新西蘭的退伍士兵，每人可以領取九百七十五美元的現金津貼，另外還可以申請一筆高至四千八百五十美元的低利貸款。如果那位新西蘭的戰士在「解甲」之後願意「歸田」，那末政府就優先給予田地—或者又借給他一筆買田的款子，他可以向政府申請高達二萬另二百美元之鉅的一筆免收利息的貸款：在四十五年內還淸。</p>
<p>而且，新西蘭常局對退伍士兵們的家庭生活也是體貼入微，士兵們如果要添購一套沙發或一只電氣冰箱，價値在五十美元以下者，祗須將購貨發票送給政府，政府立刻付賬。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫和羅馬尼亞對於使「解甲」者「歸田」一方面也頗盡力，他們把軸心國人民和親軸心國民的田地全部沒收後，平均分攤給解甲歸來的壯士們，往往一個人可以分配到二十英之多，祗要肯辛勤耕耘，一生可以不愁吃着了。</p>
<h3>交友</h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>提起交友，我們很自然而然的想起「如何交友及感應他人」的那位作者台爾·卡納基氏，其實，卡氏在刊行此書前，早已著作等身，他所寫的演說術等書，在三十餘年前即爲紐約，勃洛克林，曲雷登，費城，巴爾狄摩各地靑年會學校，採作敎本。他的文筆流利生動，嚴肅的題材　寓有輕鬆的穿揷，讀之趣味盎然。他本人又歷任勃洛克林商會，費城地產局，紐約徵信員協會等處敎職，可是他一直奄奄無聞，直到他寫了「如何交友—」一書後，方才　望大著，足見世人重視交友的一般了。</p>
<p>關於交友，我又記起在某英文　誌上看到的一篇小文，說某田在晨間外出，不須他開口，報僮自動將報紙　給他；搭上街車時，司機替他空出一個坐位來；上烟兌店購香烟，也用不到付現款，因爲這些人都是他的老朋友。此意與我國的俗語「在家靠父母，出外靠朋友」相仿，且更深一層，不意交友可享受這許多方便，有左右逢源之樂，令人欣美不止。</p>
<p>我嘗將此意吿知敝友康公，康公却不以爲然。他說要使人家　你奔走，須用鈔票結交。於是我讀了那篇文章所生的美　　幻夢，就被他一針見血的戳破了。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第九章　洩漏機密（六三）</p>
<p>肖柏道：「你認爲沒道理，她正在不顧一切，努力進行呢，雙方都籌備很成熟。」　如道：「這種婚姻大事，不得家長通過能成立嗎？」柏道：「現在靑年人幹事不比我們，他祇要目的能達到，是不擇任何手段的。」毓如道：「我以家長地位，可以阻止他。」肖柏搖搖頭道：「這個沒效果，憑你的權力，把渚齋呌回來，大駡一頓，那是辦得到的，要阻止他結婚，却不可能。他也不用麻煩，只須背着你一走，雙雙到外埠結婚，到了生米巳成　飯，你還有什麽辦法？你只有一個獨子，你捨得和他脫　關係嗎？到那時，也祇好季季曲曲承認了。」毓如給肖柏如此一說，瞪着兩眼，說不出話來，只把脚連跥幾跥，口寫說道：「氣死我，氣死我！」肖柏道：「你不用生氣，我有個辦法，你姑且試一試，也許有效。顧綺紈原是宦門　秀，家世很好，她平日最好面子，現在祇有你　到她家裏，和她談判，把作家　情形吿訴她，並對她聲明，渚齋和鳳笙　婚，你並不知道，鳳笙名分上還是作家　　，將來她到你家是沒有地位的。並且你家裏並沒財產，將來生活上很成問題，旣做你家妒　，就不便再上台唱戲了，這種種問題，都應該攷慮。再說渚　又是你獨生子，你的太太對　禮敎，又最注重，別呌渚齊爲了她，弄得左右爲難。至她鍾情渚齋，你很能原諒，這事芳在朱結婚以前，一定極端贊成，現在已結婚了，再有此事，呌做家長的，很難處置。你對她說話，只要婉轉帶着求的語意，她一定會給你感動軟化了。你若憑着一篇大道理，　辭辭　問她，這事將愈鬧愈僵，將來是不可收拾的。」毓如聽了，遲疑好一會，說道：「我這般年紀，還要去央求一個女孩子人似乎花不來。」肖　道：「你要一家安樂，祇有這法子最妥，因爲男女一發牛感情，千磨百折，都不易搖動，必須能抓住她的弱點，乘虛直入，才能動搖她的心志。綺紈這人生性很崛强，却富於情感，也祗有用這法子才可以打動她。」毓如聽了，還在　躇不決，徐太太在旁勸道：「二弟說的話不錯，你何妨去一趟，能成功更好，就是沒結果，再想別的辦法呀！」毓如經他太太和脅柏再三慫恿，又經過一夜放慮，第二日，才決定到綺紈家裏去試探！（本　完）</p>
<h3>論醫德</h3>
<p>— 買儀</p>
<p>我的孩子患百日咳已將近一月了，起初服用市上廣吿很大的咳嗽成藥，試過多種都毫無效驗。於是，經朋友的介紹，先後求敎了兩位相當有名的小兒科醫生。第一位醫生問明了病情之後就皺着眉頭說：「飲食冷熱當心一點，假使發現孩子有熱度再來診治。」他連藥方也不開一張就把我讓了出來。我走出門時，心裹眞有些冒火，如此做醫生賺人診費未免太省事了。第二位醫生態度十分殷勤，他說必須要打針。問他要打多少針，回說祗少要十五針，費時約一個多月；我想孩子已經咳嗽了一個月，再加上一個多月打針的日子，是否能就好尙是問題，結果還要挨到一百日，那又何必多費針　醫費？</p>
<p>今天，偶然逢到一位老同學他究竟咳嗽有什麽特效葉？他笑着回說：「今天我以老同學的地位吿訴你，普通醫生都不肯講給；不但我們中國沒有，世界任何一國都還沒有，最近美國人有一說現在所有的咳嗽藥都沒有特效。」我方始恍然。回想起來我請敎的第一位醫生倒是樸實可愛，第二位醫生分明是拉生意騙醫費。</p>
<p>記得數年前我有一位朋友在夏天肚裏劇痛，先到某大醫院就診，斷定是盲腸炎須開割。這位朋友因爲嫌這家醫院診費較昂，又趕到另一醫院再檢驗一次仍是肓腸發炎，醫生限他一小時丙就要施行手術；他急匆匆利用這一小時去張羅診費，忽然一時內急，瀉了一陣後腹痛頓時好了；我這位朋友一直到現在未經開割盲腸而健好如故。難道這二家名醫院都連肓腸炎也檢驗不淸嗎？我想還是因貪做一筆現成生意，反正開割肓腸是相當安全的，再說盲腸之於人體究竟也是贅疣。然而，就醫德說，乘人於危，大違醫生本旨了。</p>
<p>我聽說過，也遇見過有許多醫生的確有仁愛犧牲的精神，令人敬仰感激的；但也儘有許多明知自己無法醫治而妄投藥石或是乘人於危做「好肉上生瘡」的醫生；希望他們設身處地反省一下，如果他自己是病人，或是病人的家屬，該是怎樣的痛苦！</p>
<h3>記憶中的凌霄漢閣</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>民初風頭甚健—恕我用這一上海灘俚語—的記者中，今天升的升爲元老或要人，死的死了，沒落的沒落了，不少當了封翁甚至祖老太爺，今天還在執筆爲文的已經屈指可數了吧。據我所知，今天仍然　鑠地馳騁筆陣的，却只有凌霄漢閣—徐凌霄先生。</p>
<p>今人所知的徐凌霄先生，大抵只是掌故家的凌霄漢閣，其實，以掌故言，凌霄先生的令弟一士先生毋寗更專長一些，我所知的徐凌霄先生却是多方面的人才，爲：</p>
<p>工程學家—他是北洋大學學工程出身的，然而却似乎終其身示幹老本行，無怪許多人不知其底細。</p>
<p>通訊專家—民初寫北京通訊，徐先生是一把好手，其特點爲　夾叙夾議；有客觀叙述亦有主觀批判。　綜合報導：把許多不相連貫的事，像穿珠子似的穿了起來，使之成爲有機的消息。　筆致風趣：以談言微中的筆調，作輕鬆有味的妙喩。　精通掌故：特別熟習每一個在朝要人的身世，性格，能够把握其立塲背景而予以推斷。　內幕新聞：從通訊裏透露出若干人舍我取的內幕，舉一隅而三隅反。　反映空氣：如從馬車在那條胡同停，池子裘坐着那些顯要看客聽戲的神情之類，把政治氣壓側面地測了出來，不避瑣碎。　文學氣質：現時所流行的「報吿文學」，是糅鎔文藝與新聞爲一，徐先生早已在通訊裏表現，可謂先知先覺</p>
<p>新聞學家—中國的大學裏有新聞系始於邵飄萍之創平民大學新聞系，而徐先生則爲平大新聞系的主要敎授，其所授課程範圍至廣，從文學到廣吿學，只可惜沒有把印刷（工科）這一門看家本事講授過。（今日名記者如張友　黃天鵬皆當時學生。）</p>
<p>戲劇學家—凌霄先生是戲迷，幾乎無文不以戲爲喩，他談戲—當然是皮簧戲—不祗談唱工做工，而且分析劇情，劇本，用活的方法來評戲，略滲西洋劇學的理論，時當新靑年根本否定舊劇而矯枉過正之時，凌霄先生實有唯一有國地側面保存中國歌劇價値之功。</p>
<p>副刋專家—在北京的民國十幾年，孫伏園晨京兩副刋是壓倒一切的，凌霄先生却能在京報另編一副刋，以高級趣味與伏國先生並立於京報，同樣擁有大量讀者。</p>
<p>以上所舉一斑，已是如此淵博。</p>
<p>凌霄先生和我雖有同事之雅，却並不熟習，我所知道他是江蘇宜興籍而生長北方，一句江南話也不會說。我在一個私立大學授課時，曾在他授課的敎室窗外經過，時隔近二十載，仍然記得當時印象是用略帶冀西口音的北京話，聲音並不大，淸　黨黑的而孔，有郊瘦島寒的丰度，穿着舊大衣，從口袋裏摸出一捲縐縐的講義來，並不如我理想中是說着一口五拴子式的淸脆白口的凌霄漢閣。</p>
<p>凌霄先生仍然筆健如昔，是使人高興的，雖然文氣漸見　颯，畢竟是「老將川馬，一個頂倆。」我在此祝福他「硬朗」！</p>

<h3>The Authorities Are Closely Watching the Bohai Sea Situation; Foreign Vessels Are Strictly Prohibited from Sailing to Dalian; Fan Hanjie Goes to Qinhuangdao to Deploy Military Forces</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] As the flames of war spread in North and Northeast China, the authorities are closely monitoring the maritime situation in the Bohai Sea. The Tianjin Customs has received orders that all foreign ships, unless specially permitted by the Chinese government to sail to Dalian or other un-opened Chinese ports, should be prohibited from sailing to any opened Chinese port thereafter. If ships sailing in violation of regulations are suspected of having certain purposes, they will be handed over to the Navigation Bureau for investigation and detention. Other ordinary foreign ships will still be handled by the Customs in accordance with anti-smuggling regulations. It is noted that this type of regulation is much stricter than similar regulations last year.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] Fan Hanjie, accompanied by Li Weichou, commander of the 62nd Army, left by car for Tangshan and Qinhuangdao at 9:00 AM on the 4th. Fan's command headquarters will be temporarily set up in Qinhuangdao to advance as the situation dictates. A Liaoxi military expert said: "The opportunity to break through the Beining Railway line is still pending. The National Army at Dahu Mountain may have been transferred, but no official report has been received yet. There is no sign that Hu Zongnan's troops will come to North China or Guanwai to provide assistance."</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 4th] General Fan Hanjie passed through Tianjin from Beiping on the morning of the 4th to Qinhuangdao. He was accompanied by Lin Weichou, Commander of the 62nd Army, and Xiong Zhengping from the Ministry of National Defense, who came to Beiping for liaison. Military transport is busy in Qinhuangdao Port, and Fan's troops are continuously disembarking.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] Shenyang: It is reported that the Communist bandits are intensifying their offensive against Jinzhou and Liaoyang in order to prevent Fan Hanjie's troops from going north. The Communist bandits are pressing on Jinzhou from the east, west, and north, and shelling the National Army positions twenty miles away from Jinzhou. Clear artillery sounds can be heard in Jinzhou City. Another group of bandits attacked Jinxi, twenty miles southwest of Jinzhou. It is rumored that Zuo Yi's cavalry is leaving the pass to reinforce Jinzhou. The Communist bandits attacking Liaoyang are advancing from the north and south, and have already captured the suburban station four miles north of Liaoyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 3rd] The war in Liaoyang has fiercely unfolded. The bandits have repeatedly reinforced their forces and launched a full-scale offensive on the evening of the 30th of last month. Fierce fighting occurred between the two sides, especially in the battle of the Taizi River northeast of the county. The National Army is currently fiercely attacking the invading bandits in the east. (Another dispatch on the 4th) A certain unit of the National Army began to mop up the northwest area of Jiujian on the north bank of the Liao River on the 2nd, and defeated more than a thousand fleeing bandits in the vicinity of Xiaoxinmin City. Another elite unit of the National Army also conducted search and sweep operations in the area west of Fuxin, seizing a large number of spoils.</p>
<h3>Li Mo'an Discusses the Strategy of Suppressing Bandits: Implement "Total War"</h3>
<p>Solidify Points, Expand Areas, with Nantong as a Demonstration Zone</p>
<p>[Local News] Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification Zone, returned to Nantong from Xuzhou via Shanghai after attending the pacification conference of Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui, and Shandong provinces. Before leaving Shanghai, Li said in a statement: the four-province pacification conference discussed future pacification strategies and decided to "thoroughly unify the party, government, and military," implement a total war of military affairs, politics, and economy, and devote all efforts to the victory of the bandit suppression war and the safety of people's lives. After reviewing the past pacification work, Li said that the shortcomings found in the past were that "our methods were not entirely suitable for the needs of bandit suppression." Therefore, from the six-province joint defense conference last year, the Jiujiang military conference to the recent Xuzhou pacification conference, this issue has been discussed in detail, and countermeasures have been decided. The system and powers of the pacification zone have been changed and expanded to implement "total war." Regarding how to carry out the pacification work in northern Jiangsu in the future, Li said that he will learn from past lessons and formulate new plans, and will make the greatest efforts to break the difficult situation. The main implementation plans for the unification of the party, government, and military are:  Request local party, government, and military personnel to thoroughly take responsibility, correct all procrastination and perfunctory work styles, and use the most economical methods to achieve the greatest goals.  Reduce people's suffering, eliminate waste and corruption, and win people's hearts.  Organize local self-defense efforts and unify their use.  Reorganize the masses to exert their strength. This is the fundamental plan for the bandit suppression war. It is planned to first use Nantong as a demonstration zone, and then promote it to other counties.  Strengthen fortifications, consolidate points, and expand areas.  Strengthen economic warfare, rush to purchase materials produced in the bandit area, and block materials that may be transported to the bandit area. Li Chang also issued a warning: "If we do not concentrate our efforts to destroy the power of the Communist bandits to make trouble at this time, then no one will survive when the Communist bandits arrive."</p>
<h3>Zhu De Convenes a Military Conference; The Bandits Plan a "Major Counteroffensive"</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] Military news: Zhu De convened a "Major Counteroffensive" conference in Jingbian County, Shaanxi, on January 18. Peng Dehuai, He Long, and Yun Ze attended. After two days and one night, the following resolutions were made:  Yun Ze's Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army will continue to advance westward, penetrate deep into the hinterland of Yimeng and Ningxia, mobilize the Mongolians to "join the army," and contain Ma Hongkui's troops from going south to Shaanxi and Gansu.  He Long's troops will temporarily provide Hu Zongnan's troops with a corridor in southwestern Shanxi, and annihilate them after they enter Shanxi, so as to prevent Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan from joining forces.  After Peng Dehuai deploys a large number of "point-grabbing" battles in Shaanxi, and under the circumstances that Hu's troops are transferred to the east and Ma's troops are contained to the south, he will seize the opportunity to attack Yan'an, Ganquan, Yulin, and other places.</p>
<h3>Scattered Bandits on the West Bank of the Han River Mostly Fled to the East Bank</h3>
<p>Xiangsha Highway Is Now Open to Traffic</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 4th] Most of the scattered bandits on the west bank of the Han River have fled to the east bank. The Xiang (Yang) Sha (Shi) Highway has been open to traffic since yesterday. There are also frequent good news from southern Henan. After the National Army recovered Deng County, the Communist bandits collapsed eastward. In addition, more than a thousand remnants of Liu's bandits passed through Liuzi east of Huangpi. The National Army ambushed and intercepted them, killing many bandits.</p>
<h3>North of Lai-Tai Highway in Shandong Province; Bandit Armed Work Team Completely Annihilated</h3>

<h3>Fishermen's Self-Defense Force in Northern Jiangsu Sinks Four Bandit Ships</h3>
<p>Captures Battalion Commander, Instructor, etc.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nantong, 4th] Many boats of the fishermen's self-defense force in the coastal area of northern Jiangsu patrolled the sea off Yancheng and Funing.

<h3>Rumor of Military Supplies Falling into Bandit Hands; Director Dong Denounces It as Baseless</h3>
<p>Distribution Situation Can Be Proved with Charts</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Director Dong stated at a press conference today: The New York Post published a report by reporter Hobbes on January 30, claiming that half of the 130 million rounds of ammunition shipped from the United States to China last summer were directly sold to the Communist bandits. This news is absolutely without any factual basis. I have obtained information from the Ministry of National Defense, and there are detailed statistical tables on the distribution of the above-mentioned ammunition, which are sufficient to prove that the various sections claimed by Hobbes are not facts. However, this table involves military secrets and cannot be published, otherwise it will only please the Communist bandits. We can assert that the various sections claimed by Hobbes are maliciously fabricated facts and have no basis. As for the accusation that some military supplies were directly sold to the Communist bandits at the Shanghai wharf by government officials, it is even more absurd and not worth refuting. Hobbes' manuscript originated from Washington, and it is said that the news came from "responsible regular bureaus," or it is a deliberate slander. If the State Council really intends to know the truth about this matter, the Ministry of National Defense of our country is ready to provide information at any time.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Summons Du Yuming and Firmly Denies to Reporters That He Will Take a New Position</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Chairman Jiang summoned Du Yuming at his official residence at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th and stayed for lunch.

When Du met with reporters in the evening, he firmly denied the rumors that he would take a new position, and said: when he met with the Chairman, he reported on his health and requested to continue to take a leave of absence for another six months, which had been granted by the Chairman. When reporters asked whether what the Chairman had granted was to continue the recuperation for "six months" or for a "very short period of time," Du did not give a definite answer. Du also said that although his health has improved compared to before, his legs are still not strong enough and he must continue to recuperate. When reporters asked where he would recuperate, Du replied that he would stay in Nanjing for a while before making a decision. Also, at noon on the 4th, Yu Youren also invited Du to lunch, but Du had to meet with the Chairman and left before the end of the banquet.</p>
<h3>Revision of the Commodity Tax Regulations Will Be Announced After the Completion of Legislative Procedures</h3>
<p>Tax Revenue in the First Half of This Year Is Expected to Be Twelve Trillion</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The current commodity tax regulations were revised by the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd according to the methods proposed by the Ministry of Finance. After being submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, they can be announced and implemented. The purpose of the revision of the regulations is to rectify tax revenue and increase the income of the national treasury, while also paying attention to reducing the burden on the people and supporting the survival of handicrafts and semi-mechanized industries. In addition to the 60% commodity tax levied on luxury goods, some handicrafts and semi-finished products are exempted from commodity tax, or are otherwise adjusted. The main points of the revision are: Items exempted from tax include: 1. Tea tax will be exempted because it is an export material to encourage foreign sales. 2. Tin foil and superstitious paper. This type of paper should be cracked down on and assigned to local areas. 3. Slaked lime. 4. Cement. Wheat flour that is semi-mechanized will be exempted, while purely mechanized will still be taxed. 5. The fur tax will be changed. Leather and fur will not be taxed, but the wool yarn tax will be levied and parts will be adjusted. Cosmetics that are luxury goods, such as perfume and lipstick, will be taxed at 60%, while ordinary cosmetics, such as vanishing cream and cologne, will be taxed at 30%. There are also important revisions to the tax system. The past regulations stipulated that the assessment should be conducted every three months. Now, in order to take into account the rising prices and avoid losses in tax revenue, it has been decided to change the assessment to once a month based on the principle of actual ad valorem. In addition, the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the levy of "10% gasoline tax." During the discussion at the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd, it was believed that the gasoline import tax has recently been increased by 40%. It is not convenient to levy commodity tax at this time, so it was not passed. The Ministry of Finance will submit a special case to the Executive Yuan for handling. However, in order to protect production, the mineral tax will continue to be suspended.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] According to information from the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of commodity tax revenue in the 36th fiscal year, as of February 3, was 4,640.1 billion yuan, which is more than twice the budgeted 1,240 billion yuan last year. Also, the commodity tax revenue budget for the first half of the 37th year has been pre-determined to be 12 trillion yuan.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Five Committees of the Legislative Yuan to Discuss the National General Budget; The Case Will Be Formally Submitted to the Yuan for Review Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The Finance, Economy, Legal System, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting all day on the 4th, chaired by Liu Ke, to discuss the national general budget for the first half of the 37th year. Xu Kan, Chief Accountant of the National Government, Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance of the Executive Yuan (representing President Zhang), Yu Dawei, Minister of Communications, Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, Yu Feipeng, Minister of Food, and Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, were all present to provide explanations. Xu Kan also stated that if there are no changes in prices, the budget for this half year is expected to be sufficient and there is no need to add additional funds. At the end of the meeting, the committee members put forward opinions on some government measures, which are briefly recorded as follows: The government has no determination to implement the special tax on wealthy families, resulting in a situation where the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. It was previously decided to levy a special construction donation, which was later changed to a special relief donation. The government should be determined to implement this. The reform of the currency system should consider its preparation due to the needs of reality. In principle, the treatment of public education personnel should be improved. The revenue section of the general budget is too small and more empty. Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, and others gave explanations separately, and decided to invite President Zhang Qun to attend the regular meeting on the 5th to explain the government's policies. After the resumption of the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 5th, the budget proposal will be formally submitted for review. If time permits, the adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel and the retroactive recognition of the increase in postal and telecommunications prices will also be discussed.</p>
<h3>General Review of Bandit Suppression Military Affairs in the Past Year; Released by the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a general review of bandit suppression military affairs in the past year on the 4th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>A Debt of Blood Owed to the Chinese Nation by the Communist Party</p>
<p>Since the summer of the 35th year, the bandit leader Mao Zedong ordered Lin Biao and other bandits in the Northeast to be heavily armed with international supplements to refuse the Chinese people to recover the territory that had been lost for fourteen years. Then, in the autumn and winter of that year, the bandits in Yan'an issued three mobilization orders in a row, provoking war with the 450 million people who were praying for peace. On the one hand, they desperately campaigned in the international community for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference to interfere in China's internal affairs in order to achieve their conspiracy to divide the country and seize power. At the same time, they also used their consistent deceptive propaganda, using the flesh and blood of the Chinese people to deceive the eyes and ears of the world, flaunting the political capital of the bandits to raise their own worth.</p>
<p>In the past year or so, the losses from the destruction, demolition, and relocation of factories and mines in Northeast and North China by these bandits have been estimated to be over tens of billions of US dollars, which is heavier than the losses of factories and mines during the eight years of the War of Resistance. The cost of the railways, highways, bridges, culverts, vehicles, stations, warehouses, and buildings that were destroyed is enough to provide China with more than 7,000 kilometers of new railways. The public and private hospitals, electrical materials, printing equipment, medical equipment, food and clothing... that were destroyed or burned or plundered and relocated to the bandit nests in the Taihang Mountains, Wutai Mountains... According to the confessions of the prisoners: "Even they secretly shed tears when they saw this destruction!" The amount of this damage is even greater and cannot be statistically calculated.</p>
<p>In total, in the past year, the losses suffered by the Chinese nation in economics, culture, morality, education... from these traitors and bandits are greater than any loss in history from Shi Jingtang, Huang Chao, Zhang Bangchang, Li Zicheng, to Wu Sangui, Wang Jingwei, and others.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong and his bandits are shouting democracy and freedom, but in fact, in the iron curtain of the bandit area, he does not allow any people to have freedom of residence, freedom of belief, freedom of action, or freedom of speech. Their guilty conscience even prevents them from allowing any Chinese and foreign reporters outside the non-bandit area to enter the bandit area for investigation, interviews, and free action.</p>
<p>In the past year, more than 14.51 million refugees have fled from the bandit areas in Northeast China, North China, and Central China. They would rather wander and beg everywhere to breathe the air of freedom than return to their hometowns to suffer the pain of intimidation and coercion. The people who are blockaded in the bandit area are either forced to join the army, or their families are separated, their property is lost, and finally everyone's thoughts, consciousness, and ancestral traditions are liquidated. They have organized all the 30 million people who came to North China, often as working slaves of different ethnic groups. In less than a year, they used "struggle," "liquidation," "joining the army," assassination, and hard labor on the 70 million farmers in the provinces of North China... rapidly reduced the population by about 20 million (according to comprehensive statistics from prisoners and escaped civil servants and students). In fact, the "land reform" in the bandit area has resulted in "fields but no one to cultivate," and everywhere is barren and no one accepts the distribution of land. In this situation of hunger and cold where there are no soldiers to join, no food to collect, and no clothes to wear, the bandit leaders have no choice but to shout out the slogans of "roaming" and "counteroffensive" to "seek clothing," "seek food," and "seek soldiers" in the government areas, intending to disrupt the whole country and replenish their rebellious capital.</p>
<p>The Mao bandit Zedong is still not satisfied with the huge debt of blood that the bandits owe to the Chinese nation. In the past month, he shamelessly confessed to the world that he also intends to drag the 450 million Chinese people and the other 500 million people in Asia into the abyss of the Communist International. However, these treasonous activities have already aroused the anger of all the Chinese people in the past year. The people in the Northeast are demanding that the government step up the recovery of the territory, the compatriots in North China are running around calling for the rescue of the National Army, and the people in Central China are shouting the slogans of "protecting their hometowns" and "destroying the traitors" everywhere. The people in South China are also stepping up mobilization to urge the government to quell the rebellion. In the past year, the bandits have been defeated in batches, gangs have been fleeing for their lives, and groups have been escaping to the mountain strongholds. The bandits in northern Jiangsu, Shandong, northern Shaanxi, and other areas north of the Yangtze River have even been forced to begin training the three methods of "breaking up into parts," "integrating from parts," and "transforming bandits into people" after being defeated.

<h3>Weng Wenhao Talks About the Work of the Resources Committee; Planning to Establish a Steel Plant in Jiangnan; Striving to Maintain the Foundation of Enterprises in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, met with reporters on the 4th and talked about the work of the committee this year, saying: The work of the Resources Committee is to do its best to develop national resources in coordination with the overall national policy. The industrial and mining enterprises in our country are the largest in the Northeast, followed by North China and Taiwan. Unfortunately, in the past two years, the industrial and mining construction in the Northeast was first taken away by the Soviet army, and then destroyed by the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits have also continuously harassed the North China region, making it difficult to carry out work. It is extremely painful that the essence of the national industrial base is being obstructed and destroyed by bandits. At present, we are deeply aware of the importance of the enterprises in the Northeast, and we should strive to maintain their foundation under the protection of the National Army. North China is still better than Taiwan and cannot be ignored. For example, the power generation and steelmaking equipment in the Tangshan, Tianjin, and Beiping line is complete and of considerable scale. We will continue to actively open furnaces and increase production. The industrial and mining construction in Jiangnan will be carried out with all efforts, mainly in five aspects: Expand the equipment of the four coal mines in Central China, western Jiangxi, Xiangkou, Huxiang, and Xiangyong, and actively increase production to supply Wuhan, Guangdong, and other places. Use the foreign exchange earned from the export of iron ore from Hainan Island to build steel plants. Preparations for the establishment will be made this year. The Kaohsiung Refinery in Taiwan was repaired last year, and there is no problem with the large-scale refining of oil. We are now trying to transport more crude oil. Four of our oil tankers have been damaged in the past. One was repaired last year, and it is now on its second trip from Arabia to transport crude oil back to Kaohsiung, 10,000 tons each time. The second ship can be repaired soon, and production can be doubled at that time. Other production targets are 300,000 tons of grain, 360,000 tons of cement, and 25,000 tons of paper. The equipment of Taiwan's industrial and mining industries is gradually expanding, seeking full development.</p>

<h3>Minister Yu of Communications Talks; Actively Restore Transportation and Industry and Mining</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The last of the ten economic reform plans formulated by President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan is to restore transportation and industry and mining to the greatest possible extent. Reporters specially interviewed Minister of Communications Yu Dawei to inquire about this matter. Yu expressed great enthusiasm for this. He said: The Ministry of Communications has been carrying out this plan at any time in the past year, and will continue to do so more actively in the future. Yu pointed out that the country is divided into three major parts: North China, Central China, and South China. In North China, the Ministry of Communications will do its best to repair and open traffic lines and plan to expand new roads within a possible scope. Keeping the Beining Railway in the north open to traffic, opening the southern section of the Jinpu Railway in Central China, and building the Yuehan, Zhegan, Xiangguiqian railways in South China are all being worked on every day. Yu's remarks fully showed his perseverance and confidence.</p>
<h3>The Implementation Points for Gradually Reducing Living Subsidies Have Been Drafted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The State Council passed the principles for adjusting the treatment of civil and military officials this year. Regarding the method of gradually reducing the living subsidy of various civil and military agencies by 5% per month from February, the Executive Yuan submitted it to the Yuan meeting on the 3rd for discussion. It was resolved to ask the Chief Accountant of the National Government, the Secretaries-General of the Five Yuan, and the Minister of Finance to jointly discuss the specific implementation methods. A meeting was held in the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM on the 4th, chaired by Chief Accountant Xu Kan. After detailed discussions and adoption, and with reference to the written opinions submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Supervisory Yuan the day before, the key points of the resolution, in addition to being submitted to the State Council, are recorded as follows: Reduce the living subsidies of various agencies. A total of 10% will be reduced in February and March this year. The responsible authorities will make overall plans on their own. How to handle it after April will be handled together when the next period of living subsidies is adjusted. Members of the Judicial, Legislative, Supervisory, and Examination Yuan, members of the Senate, judges, and teachers are not subject to the above restrictions. Business organizations should strictly restrict additional personnel and may not transfer business expenses to personnel expenses. Military administrative agencies will be handled in accordance with the first method. In the future, vacancies in various agencies will not be filled, and no additional personnel may be added.</p>
<h3>French Troops in Vietnam Invade Yunnan Territory; We Lodged a Strong Protest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Kunming, 4th] The commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here recently lodged a strong protest with the French consul in Yunnan, because more than 100 French armed forces in Vietnam invaded Kangping Township, Jiangcheng County, Yunnan Province, on December 27 of last year, indiscriminately shot at villagers, and robbed merchants of more than 30 carts of goods. Our country has requested the French side to guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future and to reserve the right to compensation for losses.</p>
<h3>Fourth District Military Law Enforcement Department Dispatched to Guangzhou to Work</h3>
<p>Will severely punish South China smuggling</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 4th Dispatch] The Fourth District Military Law Enforcement Department of the Ministry of National Defense has recently been dispatched from Nanjing to Guangzhou. According to Zhong Binggen, the person in charge of the department, who spoke to reporters, the jurisdiction of the department includes the six provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Fujian. All those who violate the overall mobilization order will be interrogated and executed according to law. In addition, an enforcement patrol team will be formed to inspect various places, especially the illegal smuggling problem in South China, which will be severely punished. Those with serious circumstances may be executed first and then reported to the central government.</p>
<h3>British Memorandum on the Kowloon Incident: We Will Give a Detailed Reply; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Ordered the Ambassador to the UK to Handle It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] Regarding the Sino-British negotiations, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced at a press conference on the 4th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Zheng Tianxi, our ambassador to the UK, to provide a full reply to the memorandum from British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 4th of last month regarding the Kowloon Walled City. The content may be announced at an appropriate time. The Chinese government earnestly hopes that the British government can accept our recommendations as soon as possible, adopt the same point of view on the Kowloon Walled City incident and the problems it has caused, and quickly seek an agreement for resolution. When answering inquiries from foreign reporters, Shi also explained that the Chinese government is aware of the sympathetic actions of Guangdong public groups organizing comfort missions to Kowloon to console compatriots in distress and providing assistance with daily necessities, but believes that there is no need to interfere. Although the Chinese government is willing to do its best to prevent the situation from deteriorating, the Chinese government's preparation of housing for those forced to relocate is a relief measure by the An'an County and has no other meaning.</p>
<h3>US Reynolds Company Borrows 20 Million to Develop Taiwan's Aluminum Industry; This Move is Purely Private Business Activity</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to inquiries made by reporters to relevant parties, the US investment in Taiwan's aluminum mining is a private commercial activity and should not be confused with US aid to China. After Reynolds came to China, he had discussions with the person in charge of the National Resources Commission. He came to Nanjing on the 2nd of this month and met with Ambassador Stuart, after which he returned to Shanghai and continued negotiations with the person in charge of the National Resources Commission in Shanghai with his agent Xu Shikang (former professor of the Department of Sociology at Yenching University). The principle is to provide loans to help increase production, exclusively operate orders, and survey the total reserves. The US side also believes that the quality of Taiwan's aluminum mines is not as good as that of Guangxi Province.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei 4th Dispatch] It is reported that Taiwan Aluminum Corporation has borrowed 20 million US dollars from the US side, and the agreement was signed in Nanjing on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 4th Dispatch] A spokesman for the National Resources Commission told a United Press reporter today that the commission has reached a preliminary agreement with the board of directors of New York's Reynolds Metal Company to cooperate technically in the development of Taiwan's aluminum industry. However, these negotiations are limited to technical cooperation with the company. The rumor that the Chinese and American governments are negotiating joint development of Taiwan in Shanghai and other places is definitely not true. There is an existing aluminum plant in Taiwan Province that can extract 300 tons of aluminum per month from soil ore mined in Fujian. With the assistance of Reynolds Company in the future, the output will definitely be effectively increased.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 4th Dispatch] Recently, the Guangdong people have attached great importance to General Wedemeyer's suggestion to the government that it should focus on the economic and political construction of South China. This has become a topic of discussion, and they hope that it can be effectively implemented.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 4th Radio: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall said at a press conference today that he could not yet say when the aid to China plan would be submitted to Congress.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] Miao Jiaming, chairman of the Committee of the US Relief Materials Office of the Executive Yuan, told our reporter that 1.8 million US dollars of aid to China in the US aid to foreign countries plan has been stipulated to be used mostly for purchasing grain to enrich the allocation of grain in the five major cities. The conversion standard for the allocation of flour in Pingjin and the allocation of rice in the three southern cities has been changed to weight in jin and liang. One jin of flour is equivalent to one jin of rice. The original standard of 49 pounds of flour per bag equivalent to 4 dou of rice has been abolished.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sino-US Cooperation in Developing Taiwan</h3>
<p>According to our newspaper's Nanjing news, China and the United States are conducting consultations on developing Taiwan Province's rich resources and supporting Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises. The US side is very concerned about investing in assistance and focuses on two points: one is economic, that is, supporting industrial and mining enterprises, and the other is military, where the US will help us complete our plan for a naval base in Taiwan. Currently, this investment cooperation is no longer a problem in principle, and technical issues are currently being studied. If it is realized, the US will not only provide economic assistance to us, but also send a large number of technical personnel to Taiwan to assist in the work. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing, responsible persons said that General Wedemeyer, when conducting an on-the-spot investigation of the situation in China, proposed a South China economic revival plan, which stated that if the politics and economy of South China can be stabilized, the United States is willing to provide assistance. Today, when the whole country is quelling the rebellion and striving for production and national construction, we feel infinite joy at the news.</p>
<p>Originally, since the victory, we should have actively developed Taiwan and South China. Taiwan has been occupied for nearly 50 years. During these 50 years, the people of Taiwan have tasted the bitterness of Japanese warlord rule. Now that the mountains and rivers have regained their light, in addition to expressing infinite excitement about Taiwan's return to the motherland, the people of the whole country also hope that Taiwan's return to the motherland can benefit the development of our national economy in the future and increase the prosperity of Taiwan itself. In the past 50 years, Japan's management of Taiwan was entirely centered on Japan and entirely centered on Japan's defense needs. The starting point was entirely to exploit Taiwan's resources for Japan's use. What it implemented can be said to be a completely colonial economic policy, which is obviously detrimental to the prosperity of Taiwan's own economy. This situation should have been corrected long ago since Taiwan's return to the motherland. Only because of the rebellion of the communist bandits in the country, the people of the whole country mobilized to quell the rebellion, and the government was unable to take care of this for a while, so it has been delayed until now. Whenever we think of this, in addition to hating the communist bandits for harming the country, we also feel deeply regretful. However, our suppression of the rebellion is progressing in parallel with national construction. By suppressing the rebellion and building the country at the same time, we can complete the construction of this Three Principles of the People Republic as soon as possible. When it comes to construction, we cannot but first think of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The past 50 years of Japanese rule have given Taiwan a considerable industrial base. As mentioned earlier, this industrial base is centered on Japan and may not be beneficial to Taiwan. We must find ways to correct it. For example, in today's Taiwan, there are Japanese-operated petroleum factories and sugar manufacturing industries, but Taiwan does not have large amounts of aluminum ore and petroleum production. In agriculture, Taiwan has barren land and many mountains, and it is not suitable for the production of sugar cane. For the needs of Japan, Taiwanese farmers were forced to abandon the economically advantageous production of grain. And the camphor industry, which Taiwan once monopolized in the world market, used to account for 80% of the world's total, but now it has declined beyond recognition. How to correct this economic situation and, furthermore, how to fully develop Taiwan's resources should be the objects that our country should strive to achieve in the great cause of national construction. Moreover, the industrial and mining equipment in the nine northeastern provinces has been mostly moved and destroyed since the victory. If we want to establish an important economic zone like the Ruhr area, we cannot ignore Taiwan.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are delighted and hopeful about the news of Sino-US cooperation in developing Taiwan. According to reports, Sino-US cooperation in Taiwan will include both military and economic aspects. From an economic point of view, we should eliminate the Taiwanese economic facilities and systems centered on Japan in the negative aspect, and strive to enable Taiwan's unique industries to have sound development and how to make Taiwan's economic construction coordinate with the economic construction of the entire nation in the future. The United States' cooperation with us in developing Taiwan is not only another symbol of the traditional friendship between China and the United States, but also a reflection of the Marshall Plan in Asia. Although we still do not understand whether Sino-US cooperation in Taiwan is part of the US aid to China plan, judging from current signs, if it is included in the US government's aid to China plan, we are afraid that this cooperation may not be able to achieve ideal results. Because according to news reports, the US government's aid to China plan only amounts to 300 million US dollars, which must be paid in 15 months, which is a drop in the bucket and seems to be of little help. If the development of Taiwan is included, the amount of aid to China must be increased; otherwise, a separate project should be proposed. We do not need to reiterate here how this investment is beneficial to the United States, which has already been concluded among discerning people.</p>
<p>As for military construction, Taiwan is a strategic location, and its importance is self-evident. We are especially interested in the US helping us complete our plan for a naval base in Taiwan. This reminds us that the Zheng family, father and son, occupied Taiwan thanks to the help of the navy. In the future efforts to build the country, we should not ignore the importance of the navy. In the war of resistance against Japan, because our sea borders were not secure, the enemy army was able to run rampant without hindrance. Fearing this lesson, the construction of our navy in Taiwan should not be delayed. We hope that due to the cooperation between China and the United States, our naval construction in Taiwan can be completed according to plan, and Taiwan's economic resources can be fully utilized. This will ensure the stability of the region and the peace of the Pacific and even the entire world!</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>In yesterday's editorial "Stability First, Rule of Law Supreme," the last few sentences were inverted and misprinted. The corrected version is as follows: "On the other hand, we must also think carefully about all measures and facilities, and must not give them a few more topics! We want to ask everyone across the country to pay attention: Stability First! Rule of Law Supreme!"</p>
<h3>Purchasing Finished Products to Rescue Industry; Shen Xirui Has Agreed on Measures in Tianjin; Banks Providing Loans Strictly Monitor Usage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin 4th Dispatch] Shen Xirui, Director of the National Bank Business Bureau, was ordered to come to Tianjin to purchase finished products from various factories and rescue small and medium-sized industries. He has now agreed on measures with the Tianjin authorities. The details are as follows: After the finished products of various factories are purchased, they are not allowed to be redeemed with interest. For small and medium-sized factories and handicrafts, the interest rate on the 40 billion loans through commercial banks has been changed to 18% to prevent malfeasance. The 8% exceeding the original interest rate will be donated by the contracting bank for local public welfare. The loan period is set at half a month to prevent price fluctuations after the Spring Festival. Each lending bank should strictly examine the use of the purchase price applied for by each factory and is not allowed to transfer it to other uses. If any violation of the aforementioned regulations is found, it will be handed over to the competent authority for discussion and punishment.</p>
<h3>Profit Tax; Minister of Finance Says Collection Methods are Fair</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 4th Dispatch] After the Executive Yuan announced and implemented the 37th year's profit tax collection method, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun issued a statement saying: "In order to mobilize the suppression of the rebellion and implement emergency measures, the government's profit tax collection method for this year refers to the spirit of the tax estimation system in various countries and adopts the tax estimation system. Therefore, the calculation procedures for this type of income tax are more complicated, and collection often starts from February and March each year until September and October, which cannot meet financial needs. In order to reduce issuance and balance revenue and expenditure, this department has repeatedly studied and submitted it for approval, so that taxpayers can pay in advance according to the estimated tax amount, and refund more and compensate less after the actual tax amount is assessed according to the tax law. As for tax refunds, interest will be added to the local central bank deposit interest rate. The estimated tax amount is calculated based on six times the tax amount of each taxpayer's profit last year. The national budget for this year is 20.5 times higher than that of the 36th year, and the profit tax revenue budget for this year is 14 times higher than that of the 36th year. In addition, the national price index for the 36th year increased by about 12 times compared to the 35th year. Now, according to the tax amount of last year, it is estimated and paid at six times first, which is still a low estimate. In order to adapt to revenue and expenditure and seize the time for tax collection, the government stipulates that it should be estimated and paid at six times first, and the rest will be refunded more and compensated less after the actual tax amount is assessed, which is naturally fair. For businesses established in November of the 36th year, the temporary tax amount is tentatively estimated at 12.6% of the actual paid-up capital, which is an even lighter burden. I hope that all industries will be aware of the difficulties of the times and actively pay taxes. I also hope that the media will promote and assist in various ways.</p>

<h3>Aerial Survey of Mount Jishi, China and the U.S. to Sign Agreement</h3>
<p>Sabban Tung Dismisses Uranium Exploration Rumors as Absurd</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Dr. Sabban Tung, Chairman of the Sino-American Mount Jishi Survey Committee, recently told a Central News Agency reporter that the agreement between China and the United States regarding the aerial survey of Mount Jishi will be signed in the shortest possible time. However, permission for future entry flights and landings will require a final decision by the Chinese government. Mr. Tung expressed great doubt about external rumors that the survey team would explore for uranium mines, saying, "This is absurd and ridiculous. No one can fly at an altitude of 30,000 feet and search for uranium mines." He went on to explain that uranium itself can emit three types of rays, but cosmic rays can also emit the same type of rays. Even if a specially made "Liberator" aircraft is equipped with the rumored uranium mine detector, it cannot determine whether the three types of rays come from uranium mines, cosmic rays, or other sources. Moreover, the three types of rays said to be emitted by uranium are short-wave rays, which are difficult to detect unless at close range. Mr. Tung said that when the survey team departs in the future, the Chinese government will send a military liaison officer to accompany each flight. At the same time, the publicly released and confidential parts of the survey results will be decided by our authorities. Mr. Tung finally pointed out that whether Mount Jishi is the highest mountain is insignificant. The mountain has never been surveyed, and the current work will enrich our scientific knowledge.</p>

<h3>Malayan Overseas Chinese Businessmen Resolve to Participate in the Legislative Council</h3>
<p>Submit List of Candidate Councilors</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 3rd] Representatives of overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce from all over the Malayan Federation held a meeting in Kuala Lumpur today.

When the representatives passed this new resolution at the meeting today, they reiterated their dissatisfaction with the recently promulgated Malayan Federal Constitution.

The association also resolved to ask the United Federation of Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce to reconsider the boycott resolution of January 18.</p>

<h3>A General Review of the Communist Suppression Military Situation Over the Past Year (Continued from Page One)</h3>
<p>Analysis of the War Situation in the Past Year</p>
<p>The capital that the bandits use to create chaos and sell out the country is "joining the army," "expanding the army," and "military communism." As long as they control a certain number of people, they strictly seal off the men, women, old, and young among those people and implement military control that is even more thorough than that of the "Nazis." As early as the winter of 1945, after bandit leader Mao Zedong returned to Yan'an from Chongqing, he proposed in the bandit's Central Political Bureau a directive to prepare to expand the guerrillas by three million in the rear of the anti-Japanese positions covered by the National Army in various war zones. When the Japanese devils surrendered, the bandit leaders sent the unarmed old Eighth Route Army, local Eighth Route Army, and New Fourth Army from Sulu, Ji, Jin, Re, Cha, Sui, etc., to the Northeast to seize weapons. They pretended to resist Japan, but never formally fought the Japanese devils. They claimed to love the country, but in China, North, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and East Mongolia, they are still instigating "independent" and "autonomous" movements to split China. Since the communist bandits' rebellion, in the past year and a half, although the casualties and losses of the National Army have totaled nearly 500,000, the number of bandit soldiers killed, dispersed, surrendered, and captured by the National Army has exceeded 1,387,567 (including 765,000 bandit officers and soldiers killed and captured last year). This is because the bandits use the good Chinese people controlled by communist party cadres and political commissars, plus a "Liberation Army" hat, as the political capital of the bandits. They divided the peasants in Northeast China and North China into five command systems and handed them over to bandit leaders Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Xu Xiangqian, Peng Dehuai, and He Long to command separately. In total, they have now expanded to 1,150,000 field army, military region troops, and militia.</p>
<p>They are expanding their army so desperately and constantly launching adventurous wars, relying on the support of international accomplices. In 1947, the bandit army occupied 338 cities and towns of various sizes in Lai North, North China, and Central China. However, after the National Army began to mobilize for a general offensive, in about half a year, 72 important cities and towns were recovered, and 266 cities and towns were still occupied by the bandits, some of which had been gained and lost two or three times or more. In the process of gaining and losing these areas, we have discovered tens of thousands of people who yearn for freedom, waving to us and cheering. They lost their freedom and realized how lovely true freedom is. They were deceived by the bandits' division of land, family members were scattered, relatives and friends became enemies, and as a result, the land was nationalized, the food was turned in, and they could not even feed themselves with what was left. Finally, they had to "join the army" as cannon fodder, leading to family ruin and financial ruin.</p>
<p>In the past twelve months, there have been as many as 82 large and small battles on the battlefield, averaging five to ten fierce battles every month. In the past three months, the number of battles has increased to almost twelve to nineteen times each month. In particular, the bandits, in the past four months, have been beaten everywhere in western Henan, eastern Henan, western Shandong, southern Shandong, and northern Anhui by the local defense corps. In Henan province alone, the local defense corps, in cooperation with the National Army, killed 73,181 bandits and more, while the local defense corps suffered only 18,400 casualties. The bandits hated these local defense corps who were fighting for the survival of the peasants and shouted the slogan "eliminate the local defense corps." However, as a result, the people who "defend their homes and kill bandits" in China have become stronger and stronger. They have reorganized the spirit of "fighting the Japanese devils" in the past eight years and used it to fight these blood-sucking demons.</p>
<p>In these battles, the losses of the National Army were only in a ratio of three to one compared to the losses of the bandits. In each war, the bandits used machine guns and artillery to force the local military region troops and militia to charge on the front line. If they succeeded by luck, the bandits would promote the militia and military region troops to the field army, and then fight on the second line. If the militia were all sacrificed on the front line, and it looked like the National Army was about to defeat the bandits' field army, they would slip away in advance. This is the fundamental reason why the strength of the old bandits is not easily lost and the population of the bandit area is rapidly decreasing. Although the bandits used this inhuman "human wave tactics," they still could not drown the heroic spirit of the National Army. In the past year, excluding the Northeast, in North China and Central China alone, the National Army captured a total of 373 various artillery pieces, 525 heavy machine guns, 1,343 light machine guns, and 107,756 long and short, new and old rifles. These all have detailed statistics and sources, times, places, and records of each battle, as well as charts and photos.</p>
<p>However, this achievement in suppressing the bandits is not considered a great achievement of the National Army. Our achievement is still in the strategic gain of shortening the lives of the bandits.</p>
<p>The government's bandit suppression strategy is to fight a quick battle and make a central breakthrough, on the one hand, to break the bandit's political center and entrenched old nest, and on the other hand, to block and suppress the bandits' chaotic and destructive movements. Therefore, the evolution of the bandit suppression strategy in the past year has broken the bandit's political center Yan'an and the important base in Shandong and Jiao, cut off the bandit's supply line at sea, and blocked the bandit's seven offensives of destruction and chaos in the Northeast. As long as we review the communist bandits' propaganda documents on "defending Yan'an," "defending Shandong," "counter-attacking northern Shaanxi," and "counter-attacking Shandong," as well as the fact that the communist bandits launched a nationwide general counter-offensive and implemented a full-scale chaos since last September, we can prove that the communist bandits' strategy has failed and the government's bandit suppression strategy has been successful. This success is giving the "war of attrition" advocated by Mao Zedong a relentless blow.</p>
<p>Today, the Chinese people, through objective analysis and comparison, all know that the communist bandits' policies are international, class-based, destructive, disruptive, dictatorial, and dark. At the same time, they also know that the policies of the National Government and the Kuomintang are national, people-based, constructive, peaceful, democratic, and bright. This has been proven by thousands of facts. Therefore, we can conclude here that although the future of bandit suppression is still very difficult, the final result will definitely be that suppressing the chaos will surely be victorious and building the country will surely be successful (end)</p>
<h3>Overall War Situation for the Past Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of National Defense issued a statement on the 4th regarding the overall war situation for the week of January 29 to February 4. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The National Army in all war zones has become active this week according to the war situation. Some are advancing rapidly to predetermined favorable areas, and some have already begun the prelude to victory. After recovering Dongfeng and Xifeng, the National Army in northern Liaoning in the Northeast took advantage of the victory to pursue and suppress the bandits and has controlled the villages and towns east of the central Chang Railway. Since the launch of the mopping-up operation in the Jilin-Changchun area, many remnants of the Chinese-Korean-Mongolian bandits have been defeated. At the moment, there are few bandit traces within a hundred miles around Jilin and Changchun. Under this situation, the bandits in southwestern Liaoning, fearing the joint attack by the National Army inside and outside the Pass, gathered their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th columns and moved to the southwest of Liaoyang and Xinmin and Heishan, Dahushan, and other places in a chaotic manner. One force once infiltrated the Wogou gangzi and even reached the vicinity of Jinzhou, trying to cut off the Ping-Shen traffic and reduce the pressure of the National Army's eastward advance. However, the elite troops of the National Army are pouring out of the Pass and arriving at predetermined locations, ready to give the bandits a head-on blow.</p>
<p>In the Hebei-Chahar area, the National Army in southern Chahar captured as many as 12 bandit armory factories, food and clothing factories, and important military warehouses in the battles to recover Sihaizhan and Huanghuacheng, all of which were weapons, ammunition, food, and fodder. Then, on January 30, they also recovered important strongholds such as Sangshu, Qingshiyan, and Huangshixie. As for the 1st and 7th columns of the bandits in North China, they are still hiding in the mountains southwest of Pingbao Qian for reorganization. The remnants of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns are scattered in the vicinity of Anxin, Tangxian, Wen'an, and Dingxian. On the one hand, due to the disintegration of military morale and the wavering of cadres, they are conducting internal re-examinations, purges, and struggles. On the other hand, they are forcibly recruiting people in various villages to "join the army" in order to replenish their forces and plot further rebellions.</p>
<p>As for Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Dabie Mountains, they have exhausted all their tricks to avoid the encirclement and annihilation by the National Army. However, our heroic National Army will never let up and is pursuing and suppressing them everywhere. In the northwest of Yuexi, they defeated more than 1,000 bandits from the 3rd Column and captured 401 alive. In addition, between Xincai, Zhengyang, and Xixian on the north bank of the Huai River, after four days of pursuit and suppression, as of yesterday, a total of four regiments and two companies of the main force of the 1st and 2nd Columns of the bandits were defeated. The bandits are now fleeing in all directions, breaking up into smaller units, and the National Army is intensifying its search and suppression.</p>
<p>As for Chen Yi's bandit troops in the Lu-Yu area, the Liangguang Column was attacked by the National Army west of Taikang and fled westward through the area between Fugou and Xihua. Their 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns are still being besieged by the National Army in the area of Dingtao, Caoxian, and Chengwu. The 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns were forced to gather around Yancheng, trying to join forces with Chen Geng's bandit troops to break out of a living path. However, the National Army north and south of the Ping-Han Line is coordinating with local troops to attack. It is expected that the bandits in this area will be severely annihilated, or the bandits will continue to embark on the path of escape.</p>
<p>While the wandering bandits were running east and west, the people in all bandit-occupied areas launched a heroic self-defense struggle against the bandits and organized self-defense corps, donating money and providing guns and food to protect their homes. This great movement has gradually spread to the bandit areas, not only making the communists in various places tremble but also forcing the bandit leaders to shout "re-examination," "purge," and "purge the army" to consolidate their internal rule. Precisely because their internal contradictions are deepening and the number of military and government cadres wavering is increasing, their mutual killings and struggles are even more tragic. We expect that in the near future, the overall war situation will surely show a new situation with the flood of popular self-defense and the internal strife of the bandit troops.</p>

<h3>Three Powers to Meet in London on the 19th to Discuss West German Administrative Reform, Britain and the United States Urge France to Join Federal Bank to Avoid Currency Division, Frankfurt Charter Could Be Announced Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York 4th Broadcast Washington News: Secretary of State Marshall confirmed at a press conference today that Britain, the United States, and France will hold a meeting in London on February 19 to discuss the possibility of merging the three occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry announced on the 4th that the meeting of Britain, the United States, and France to discuss the future status of West Germany will begin in London on February 19. France and the United States will each send their ambassadors to the United Kingdom as representatives. British and American officials hope to persuade France to join the British and American common occupation zones and organize the Rhineland occupation zone so that West Germany can be controlled by a single administrative agency.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 3rd] German officials believe that the reason for the delay in announcing the Frankfurt Charter is that Britain, the United States, and France have not yet concluded their discussions on the establishment of a West German Federal Bank. The draft charter for the merged zone, which was revised based on the Frankfurt resolution in January, is expected to be published by the British and American authorities early next week. If negotiations on the four powers' unified German currency reform fail, the proposed West German Federal Bank will play a very important role in any West German currency reform. Therefore, although Britain and the United States are willing to no longer wait for France and proceed directly with the administrative reform of the merged zone, they are eager for France to participate in the Federal Bank to avoid the division of the West German currency system. The currency cooperation plan to be discussed at the London Britain-United States-France meeting is not expected to promote France's complete integration with the British and American zones, but will promote the removal of some zone barriers, including the free movement of goods and passengers. The establishment of a central bank shared by the three occupation zones will also be given priority. Relevant parties believe that in addition to consulting with France on the political and administrative nature of the implementation of the merged zone reform, Britain and the United States have also consulted with France on the establishment of a bank. It is said that the main difficulty is still the dispute between federalism and centralism. The British and American draft stipulates that the governors of the state banks should jointly elect the board of directors of the Federal Bank, while German experts believe that the board of directors should not be too restrained by the state banks, so they advocate that the president of the Federal Bank should appoint the board of directors.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Stuttgart, 3rd] General Clay, the U.S. military government chief in Germany, held a press conference here today, stating that the U.S. government welcomes Germany to have a federal government. When discussing the composition of federal institutions, including the division of powers between the central government and the states, it will inevitably take a long time. The United States went through this process at the beginning of its founding. He hopes that the future German government should be flexible rather than rigid. Any government approved by the majority of the German people is welcomed by the American people. Clay also revealed that the declaration of the Frankfurt German Economic Committee is expected to be published next week, and the work of purging the Nazis can be completed around June 1, 1948.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 3rd] News today: The German Economic Committee of the British and American merged zone in Germany has recommended to the merged zone control committee that the merged zone immediately conclude trade agreements with the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, Sweden.</p>
<h3>The United States is Studying a New Plan for Military Assistance to Greece and Turkey, Marshall Announced at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York 4th Broadcast: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall told a press conference today that the State Department is considering the possibility of implementing a new plan for military assistance to Greece and Turkey. The recommendations made by the U.S. delegation to Greece on the plan are being studied by the State Department.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 3rd] According to Admiral Seitel, director of the U.S. naval committee, who recently arrived in Ankara, the United States will give the Turkish government a total of 22,000 tons of submarines and auxiliary ships. He also said, "We intend to strengthen the insult military equipment of the Ismit Bay base, and we intend to send naval instructors with naval equipment to Turkish naval schools. In short, we are willing to apply the experience of modern warfare to the Turkish navy." Admiral Seitel previously served as the U.S. naval commander in North China and Korea.</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall Warns Congress Not to Cut Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Marshall today issued another warning to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, pointing out that if Congress intends to cut the aid funds for the first fifteen months of the implementation of the Marshall Plan to below $6.8 billion, the success of the aid to Europe plan will be hindered. When Marshall issued this warning to Congress, outsiders demonstrated at the State Department, opposing the plan's proposal to transfer American ships to European countries. The demonstration was organized by the National Maritime Union, which opposed selling or transferring 500 American merchant ships to Europe.</p>
<h3>Sweden Not to Join West European Union System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Stockholm Radio announced that Sweden will not participate in any West European union system, as recently proposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin.

<h3>Soviet-Occupied Zone of Germany Strengthens Economic Effectiveness</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 3rd] The Soviet side recently announced that the Soviet military government in Germany intends to grant administrative powers to the Central Economic Committee of the zone. The Soviet Economic Committee is an advisory organization with the power to provide only suggestions and draft laws, but these suggestions and draft laws have never been followed by the state governments. From now on, the Soviet Central Economic Committee will have a permanent chairman, giving him concrete powers. The tasks of the committee and its president will therefore be the same as those of the Economic Guidance Committee of the British and American merged zone in Frankfurt. The Soviet side stated that this move aims to strengthen the economic effectiveness of the Soviet zone and is not intended to counter the decision of the British and American military governments to establish a joint administrative agency for the two zones.</p>

Under these circumstances, the U.S. government does not believe that this agreement is in conflict with Article 11 or other provisions of the Italian peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Hitler and His Mistress to be Tried In Absentia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] It is reported that the Nazi Purification Tribunal in Munich will soon try Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, in absentia. Although it is rumored that they committed suicide in the air-raid shelter of the Berlin Chancellery on April 29, 1945, their bodies have never been found. According to legal experts from the U.S. military government, the purpose of conducting a trial in absentia is to determine the status of their property. If Hitler and Eva are found guilty, the court will order the confiscation of their property by the state, to be used as reparations to the Allied nations in the future. Other key Nazi war criminals, such as Göring, former Governor-General of Poland, Frank, former Governor of Bavaria, Streicher, former Minister of Economy, Funk, former Governor-General of the Netherlands, Seyss-Inquart, former Deputy Führer Hess, Bormann, and the Mayor of Vienna, Schirach, will also be prosecuted so that their property can be disposed of.</p>
<h3>UN Korean Commission Held Plenary Session Yesterday, Differing Opinions on Separate Elections in South Korea</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The United Nations Korean Commission held a plenary session at Deoksugung Palace this morning at 10:00 AM, but no formal communiqué was issued after the meeting. A formal decision was made on personnel matters during today's meeting. The Indian representative, Menon, was re-elected as Chairman of the Korean Commission, and the daily chairmanship of the parliament will be rotated among representatives of various countries. In addition, the Chinese representative, Liu Yuwan, was nominated as the secretary of the Political Committee of the Commission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 4th] The United Nations Korean Commission now seems to be heading towards a showdown with the Soviet Union. Three representatives of the Commission urged in the plenary session this morning to hold elections in South Korea immediately, disregarding Soviet resistance. Of the four representatives who expressed their opinions in the plenary session, only one representative opposed holding elections in South Korea and advocated returning the entire issue to the United Nations General Assembly's Resident Committee for handling. The three countries advocating immediate elections in South Korea are China, France, and the Philippines. So far, only Syria has expressed opposition. It is reported that the Canadian representative also opposes holding elections in South Korea. However, the representative of El Salvador made undisclosed remarks stating that he would support holding elections in South Korea. With El Salvador supporting this position, the number of representatives supporting elections in South Korea will increase to four (note: the Commission has a total of eight representatives).</p>
<h3>North Korean Zhang Shangtie Mails Fail to Deliver</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 3rd] This agency has learned from reliable sources that senior Soviet officials stationed in North Korea have received instructions to avoid any contact with the United Nations Commission responsible for organizing the Korean government. It is also learned that the Soviet liaison officer stationed in Seoul claimed that he had no authority to deliver Chairman Menon's letter from the United Nations Commission to the Soviet military commander in North Korea.

<h3>Soviet Union Has Special Intentions in Training Korean Troops</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Brigadier General Helmick, Deputy Commander of the US military government in Korea, told reporters in Washington on the 3rd that if the US withdraws from Korea, 250,000 Koreans trained by the Soviet Union in North Korea could immediately take over the entire country. South Koreans generally believe that the takeover of the entire country by these Koreans is only a matter of time. Helmick also said that the North Korean army has Japanese weapons, and some are experienced from participating in the Manchurian Communist war. Although South Korea also has Korean-organized troops and police forces, their strength is far inferior to the North Korean troops. Regarding the stalemate in US-Soviet negotiations on holding elections for a Korean parliament to establish a national democratic government, Helmick believes that it cannot be broken for the time being.</p>

<h3>MacArthur's Directive that Purification of Hirano by the Japanese Supreme Court Remains Valid, District Court's Injunction to Stop Purification of Hirano Revoked</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Chief Justice Mitsubuchi of the Japanese Supreme Court issued an important statement on the issue of Hirano's purification, stating: "Today, we received instructions from MacArthur's headquarters stating: 'The purification of不良份子 (undesirable elements) is based on the headquarters' instructions from the previous year, which is very clear. This matter is the direct responsibility of the Supreme Commander. The Japanese Prime Minister is merely acting on his authority. Therefore, the Japanese courts have no jurisdiction over events to judge whether one should be purged, hence the temporary disposition of the Tokyo District Court is regarded as an invalid judgement without jurisdiction.' The temporary disposition regarding the cessation of Hirano's purge naturally loses effect." The government's purge of Hirano remains effective. Currently, the opposition Liberal Party and the All-Farmers faction are planning to use the Hirano incident as an excuse to launch a no-confidence motion against the government in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The heated dispute caused by the issue of purifying former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano Rikizo came to an abrupt end today because the Supreme Court has invalidated the Tokyo District Court's injunction against the government's decision to purify Hirano.</p>

<p>"Quantitative" and "Qualitative" Dispute</p>
<p>The London Naval Conference was convened in 1935 and ended at the end of March 1936. President Roosevelt had a strong interest in the progress of the conference. From childhood, he had extensive experience with ships of all kinds. Even as a child, the naval vessels passing near the coast of New England particularly attracted his attention. When he came to Washington to serve as Secretary of the Navy in the Wilson administration, he was known for his proficiency in naval issues, tactics, facts, and management. By the time he left office, he had made a deep study of all important naval issues and was fascinated by the Navy.</p>
<p>When he took office as president, his knowledge of the navy was perhaps greater than that of any of his predecessors. Throughout his presidency, I found that he always gave priority to every issue related to the navy. Most of the more important decisions regarding naval affairs were made by him personally. At the London Naval Conference, the president demonstrated rare knowledge of the technical aspects. He was extremely qualified to discuss the merits of various developments belonging to the most technical aspects and to offer advice. Even the oldest and most experienced admirals had great respect for his profound knowledge of naval affairs.</p>
<p>In the telegrams I sent to the president and in our verbal discussions on the floor of the London Conference, we used the words "quantitative" and "qualitative" dozens or hundreds of times with regard to limiting naval armaments. The former refers to limiting total tonnage, and the latter refers to limiting the size of various ships and the caliber of the artillery positions. One day, the president ran out of patience. He shouted, "Quantitative, qualitative, quantitative, qualitative, I am tired of hearing these words. Can't we find some words to replace them?" But we couldn't find any.</p>
<p>On February 28, the President made a proposal for a naval treaty. He sent it to the State Department in the form of a memorandum, and then we used constant reports to send it to Norman Davis, the head of our delegation in London at the time. This proposal crystallized into a portion of the London Treaty and became one of the most important developments in the conference. The President said, "What do you think if we send a telegram to Davis, asking him to try to obtain a gentlemen's agreement from the UK, France, Italy (and, via the UK, from Germany) to the effect that every country agrees to notify the other countries when deciding to build any form of naval vessel of more than one hundred tons? If such a gentlemen's agreement could be obtained, then these four or five countries could unite or some of them could invite Japan to do the same."</p>
<p>The question of whether Germany should become a signatory to the treaty was a delicate one. On June 18, 1935, Britain and Germany signed an agreement stipulating that the German navy would be 35 percent of the Royal Navy. Because this figure was more than three times the naval strength Germany was allowed to maintain under the Treaty of Versailles, France and Italy lodged strong protests. For our part, we continued to be unwilling to make any representations, because the Anglo-German agreement was essentially about Europe and because we were not signatories to the Treaty of Versailles. When Britain suggested inviting Germany to the London Naval Conference, France stated that if Germany was invited to join, France and Germany must reach an agreement on the Rhineland issue, and Britain and France must reach an agreement on mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Hitler resolved the discussion of the Rhineland issue in a straightforward manner. German troops occupied the Rhineland on March 7, 1936, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact. At that time, the London Conference was drafting the contents of the final agreement. The invasion of the Rhineland was a development in Europe that did not involve us, and Washington should not take any action. However, this was clearly another major step towards war. On March 9, I telegraphed Davis to ask him to express his views on the new situation in Europe and the various rumors or news that might involve the United States. I also said, "In any case, we are undoubtedly entering a period of increasing tension in the European situation."</p>
<p>By March 20, we had sent the final draft of the treaty to the president.</p>
<p>The President approved the treaty but made a suggestion. On March 20, we forwarded this suggestion to Davis, which said, "Davis should make it clear that the United States government and its representatives deeply regret the failure to stipulate restrictions on quantity (total tonnage) in the new treaty."</p>
<p>On March 23, I telegraphed the President's thoughts to Davis, that is, Davis and Admiral Stanley should jointly send a letter to Eden, the head of the British delegation, "expressing pleasure and gratitude for the interactions during the conference, and taking this opportunity to mention that the new treaty, like previous naval treaties, does not stipulate quantitative restrictions. Our government hopes to avoid competition with Britain in naval construction; the British Empire and the United States should accept the method of equal fleets as a recognized and established principle; the current situation and environment prove that the two governments should continue to adhere to the principle of equal fleets; adhering to this principle will help the friendly relations between the two governments and world peace." The British could respond in the same tone.</p>
<p>As soon as this matter was completed, news leaked immediately, and news of various "secret agreements" that Anglo-American naval cooperation had been established spread everywhere. Minister Wilson informed me from Geneva that this "leak" came from the Japanese observers attending the London Conference, who were at any time informed of confidential information by the British side. Therefore, we were prepared to publish these two letters together.</p>
<p>In April 1936, when Davis returned from London, he and I had a long conversation about the world situation. A major problem and responsibility were presented before us, which our government had to cope with. It involved a firm decision, namely, given the chaotic situation in many parts of the world, when should our country, in light of actual circumstances, abandon its attempts to maintain peace through disarmament and quickly begin to fully arm itself so as to resist the actions of Germany, Japan, and Italy, which were clearly heading towards military conquest?</p>
<p>For more than a decade, the world's tendency has been largely in the direction of disarmament. But in the last few years, we have seen Japan, Germany, and Italy's words and actions clearly reveal aggressive intentions. We have seen these countries violate all disarmament efforts and every treaty to maintain peace. At the same time, we have seen a mad and unrestrained arms race, coupled with the noise of conquest and shameless threats, and these aggressor nations are naturally the main actors in this.</p>
<p>When Davis and I discussed these developments, one thing was very clear: it was almost impossible to maintain peace through disarmament. So the question at the time was, could law-abiding countries make appropriate cooperation to contain the rapidly developing military aggression plans, and to what extent could they cooperate? But, as everyone knows, our government in fact had to ignore this possible method of maintaining peace for the simple reason that the majority of public opinion was strongly or even fiercely opposed to our participation in this type of joint action.</p>
<p>The only way for the United States, on the one hand, to continue to persuade and promote peace, urging countries—especially those determined to engage in aggression—to adopt similar policies, and, on the other hand, was to immediately pay attention to the actions of the aggressors and arm our country without further delay to a degree sufficient to protect our country's security.</p>
<p>In early 1935, I had already told the president my fervent belief that we should hurry to build a larger navy, especially for the situation in the Far East. On January 22, 1935, I sent him a memorandum, accompanied by an excellent report from Ambassador Grew in Tokyo, which analyzed the outlook of the East very clearly, and attached a memorandum drafted by the State Department on the Far East issue.</p>
<p>One section of the State Department's memorandum said: "We should intensify our efforts to have a navy so strong that no country dares to seriously think of attacking us; we should make it clear that our people, on the one hand, do not want to fight and have no reason to attack any other country, and, at the same time, are not only not too proud to fight, but, under certain conditions, will be too proud not to fight."</p>
<p>Some cabinet members were surprised that the Secretary of State would recommend building a navy. A friend of the President and I, Baruch, once said to me that the President was surprised that I was so eager to build a larger navy.</p>
<p>In 1935, I began planning how to accumulate tin, because tin is a military raw material that is not produced much in the United States and is necessary for the Army and Navy in the event of war. Vance, the State Department's economic advisor, and I drafted a plan together, and through him, I conveyed this idea to British Ambassador Lindsay and put the plan before him. The main point was that Britain should obtain a certain stipulated amount of tin and hand it over to our government, the price of which could be credited to the account of British debt owed to our country.</p>
<p>After studying the plan, Lindsay came to see me on June 6, 1935, and said that he had sent the proposal to London.</p>
<p>Lindsay's expression was extremely gloomy. He said that the British people believed that the debt had already been settled, and it would be difficult for the British government to obtain funds to pay for the transfer of tin to us.</p>
<p>I reminded the Ambassador that the main supply of tin in the world was under the control of the British capital. A small amount of payment in kind, as we suggested, could revive the previous symbolic method of debt repayment and conform to the spirit of this method. This was something the British government had been very happy to do before, until the unfortunate impact of the Johnson Act occurred, at which point it stopped. This action could have a good impact on the views of our people on the British government.</p>
<p>But Lindsay did not think that this suggestion would even be accepted by the British Foreign Office. He was right. The reply from London was a complete rejection. It was not until four years later, three month before the outbreak of the European war, that we were able to negotiate an agreement with Britain stipulating the exchange of cotton for rubber and tin. Only then did we begin to accumulate important military raw materials.</p>
<p>In fact, if the State Department's efforts could have yielded results as early and as fully as we had hoped, we could have been fully prepared when the war broke out at Pearl Harbor, which would have greatly reduced the wartime burden.</p>

<h3>New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone to Take Effect Today; Telephone Rates Increase the Most, Gas the Least, Water and Electricity Average Increase of 32 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The four public utilities in this city, water, electricity, gas, and telephone, will again be adjusted today according to the automatic adjustment formula for public utility prices. The highest increase is for telephone rates, reaching 37 percent, followed by gas, with an increase of 25.3 percent, while water and electricity average an increase of approximately 32 percent. As for public transportation prices for trams, buses, small trains, and city ferries, these will also be adjusted around the middle of this month, with the Public Utilities Bureau currently auditing accounts. Based on a March exchange rate increase of approximately 35 percent, a coal price increase of 38 percent, a cost-of-living index increase of 40 percent, and a hardware price increase of 26 percent, the Public Utilities Bureau invited representatives from the Municipal Council, representatives from the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, and responsible persons from various companies to conduct detailed calculations and determine the amount of the adjustment. After submitting it to the Municipal Government for approval, it was decided to implement it starting today (the 5th) from the date of meter reading. The new prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Three Female Workers at Shenxin No. 3 Factory Die; Prosecutors Summon Family Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A disturbance occurred at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory a few days ago. The bodies of three female workers who died, Wang Mumei, Zhu Meizhen, and Jiang Zhenxing, have been inspected by prosecutors dispatched by the district prosecutor's office. Yesterday morning, inspection officer Chen Shoutao summoned the deceased's family members to court for questioning. Those who arrived were Zhu Shiliang, the brother of Zhu Meizhen, Jiang Li Shi, the mother of Jiang Zhenxing, and Sheng Zhonghao, the cousin of Wang Mumei. According to Jiang Li Shi and others, the victims were forced to become members of the factory workers' patrol team and died from stray bullets.

<h3>Police Bureau Report Has Not Arrived; Chief Prosecutor Expresses No Opinion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In recent days, due to the continuous Tongji University student movement, the dance industry's petition to vandalize the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shenxin No. 9 Factory's strike and bloodshed incident, all of the involved criminals have been detained at the police bureau for investigation. Most of them will be sent to the district prosecutor's office for interrogation in the short term. This reporter visited Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang yesterday and asked if he had any opinions on the above three cases. Chief Huang said: "Administrative agencies are deductive, while judicial agencies are inductive. It is necessary to wait until the case is transferred to the district prosecutor's office and synthesize various facts before a conclusion can be reached. Before seeing the police bureau's investigation report, it is impossible to express an opinion. As for how to handle each case in the future, evidence will be emphasized and handled according to law. Whether the administrative measures were inappropriate or whether there is a political background is not within the scope of the law and will not be investigated." As for the deaths of the three female workers at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, whether the police opened fire is still unknown. However, according to the "Regulations on the Use of Weapons," the police and military have the right to use weapons when suppressing disturbances and maintaining order when necessary, so it does not constitute a crime.</p>

<h3>Customs Officers Tried for Accepting Bribes; Admit Receiving Gold Bars but Claim to Have Been Framed</h3>
<p>On January 7th of this year, when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hanyang vessel arrived in this city from Hong Kong, Jianghai Customs inspectors Yang Zhicai and Jin Qingliang were dispatched to inspect the vessel. When they checked the side of the ship's doctor, Xin Afa, they found a package of gold bars, totaling 30 bars, with the larger ones weighing ten taels and the smaller ones weighing six taels. According to regulations, they should have been confiscated, but Wu Guozhang, the passenger who had smuggled the gold bars, stepped forward and privately negotiated with Yang and Jin, so they were not confiscated. Afterward, Wu rewarded Yang and others with nine gold bars, but Wu Guozhang later went back on his word and reported the matter to the Jianghai Customs authorities. Yang Zhicai and Jin Qingliang were immediately detained and transferred to the court for trial on charges of corruption. The case was first heard by the district court yesterday. However, according to the two defendants, the case was deliberately framed by the informant, Wu Guozhang. They accepted Wu's nine gold bars only because Wu pleaded bitterly. If all the gold bars were confiscated, they would have received a reward of nine gold bars, and so on. The court considered that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled the trial.</p>

<h3>After Returning to Nanjing, Deputy Minister of Education Hang Liwu Expresses Admiration for the Spirit of Shanghai University Presidents; Relays to the Authorities to Generously Raise Funds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] After the Tongji student movement subsided, Deputy Minister of Education Hang Liwu returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 4th. When asked by reporters about his impressions of Shanghai, he replied that the vast majority of students in Shanghai schools were able to recognize the importance of the school and were unwilling to easily sacrifice the opportunity to attend classes, as was the case with Tongji students, so he was pleased that the student movement could be resolved smoothly. At present, 90% of Tongji students are attending classes as usual, and the remaining 10% are students who took leave to return home to avoid trouble during the strike and will soon return to school. Furthermore, after his close contact with the presidents of various universities in Shanghai this time, he deeply felt the heavy responsibility and busy work of the university presidents, especially in solving the problem of rice, oil, salt, and firewood for faculty and students, which took a lot of effort. The presidents of the various schools are diligent and hardworking, and their spirit is admirable. All schools feel that their funding is insufficient, and Hang has decided to relay this to the Standing Committee and to generously raise education funds as much as possible. When asked by reporters about the punishment methods for the troublemakers in the Tongji student movement, Hang replied that a portion would be handed over to the court for trial, and another portion would be given appropriate punishment by the school authorities.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Telegraphed Tongji to Strictly Rectify; Ordered the Expulsion of Students Involved in the Incident</h3>

<h3>Two Ships Scheduled to Sail to Japan to Transport Reparations Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In addition to a portion of the first batch of Japanese reparations materials that have already been transported back by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Kang" and "Hai Zhe" vessels, the Supervision and Transportation Committee has recently scheduled the China Xing Company's "Yong Xing" vessel and the Yi Xiang Company's "Li Min" vessel to continue to transport materials.

<h3>It is Difficult for Factories Relocated Inland to Export; Hope the Government Will Continue to Support; Four Groups Issue a Declaration to Fight for Japanese Reparations Materials</h3>
<p>The United Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guizhou, the United Association of Factories Relocated to Shaanxi, and the Post-War Private Cotton Mill Resumption Committee have repeatedly petitioned the relevant authorities to demand reparations for "the reparations materials". Now that the first batch of Japanese reparations materials has arrived in Shanghai and the government has set a price allocation method, a joint declaration has been issued to express their views. The original text is very long, and the general meaning is: "At a time when the industry is extremely shrinking, we believe that the result of the 'price allocation' of reparations materials, based on the government's experience in bidding for enemy and puppet factories and allocating post-war relief industrial and mining equipment at price, is nothing more than the following two points: First, there is a lack of applicants, which leads to the long-term storage and damage of materials. Second, speculators use it as a hoarding object, which increases the difficulty of industrial development and affects the social economy. However, if a part of the 'early reparations' can be given to the factories relocated inland, then there are talents and materials without emptiness, and it is hoped that the effect of maximizing the use of both can be achieved. Each factory does not need many materials, and the government's loss of current income is limited, but as a result, each factory can rely on it to continue production, and the government can also show encouragement. Weighing the gains and losses is also very well-considered. The methods are also easy to implement. The methods of 'early reparations' and preferential purchase for factories relocated inland have been jointly suggested to the government and are not difficult to implement. The 'account price allocation' method allows factories relocated inland to apply for price allocation first, but the price will be settled after the peace conference with Japan determines the amount of reparations, and then the losses of each factory are proportionally calculated. Even if the government can use a part of the price obtained from the price allocation to compensate us in advance, it is also possible to use it to resume business. To speak of justice is to maintain discipline and adjust the plan. To speak of gains and losses is to seek wealth and strength for the country. There are many feasible methods, and there are no real difficulties for the government. It is the utmost to consider things in a long-term perspective and to think in other people's shoes. However, after repeated practice, the understanding of the relevant authorities has not been obtained, and after waiting for several months, no practical and reasonable response has been received. Is it possible that the relevant authorities still have some unavoidable difficulties? It has been said to the authorities that, firstly, the Allied Powers' peace conference with Japan has not yet been opened, and the amount of reparations for each country has not been determined, so people's reparations cannot be handled. Secondly, the initial dismantling and relocation of reparations materials by Japan was originally intended to dismantle Japanese military industrial industries and was stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission that the criteria for Allied countries to apply for and allocate dismantling materials should be based on the conditions of being able to quickly utilize and supplement equipment. The handling of materials that our country requests and may obtain cannot but pay attention to the above standards in order to strive for priority in order to continue to claim compensation. The report said that the first batch of reparations materials are all working machine tools. According to the government's economic construction policy, the focus is on developing the textile industry, followed by the paper industry, the electrical appliance industry, and coal mines. All industries that manufacture or repair textile, paper, or electrical appliances and coal mines that increase coal production can request price allocation. Thinking about it, there are countless factories relocated inland that specialize in manufacturing the above types of machine tools and are famous in the country. The products that are still in use everywhere are everywhere. If the government can provide assistance today, it is confident that it can still do something. This is why we, even though we are in dire straits, still hope that our government can continue to support us with the enthusiasm it showed when assisting us in relocating inland. In short, we have nothing to hate and nothing to complain about today. In addition to seeking assistance from the highest authorities, we also want to tell the people of the country that our original intentions have not changed, there is no way to be effective, the situation is becoming more and more difficult, and the matter is becoming more and more urgent. The success or failure of individuals is a small matter, and the prosperity or decline of the country is a big matter. As a commoner, how can I allow myself to refuse responsibility? What I hope is that the gentlemen of the country will provide support and enlighten the authorities to give support, so that people can make the most of their talents and materials can be used to the fullest, to comfort loyalty and to prevent speculation. The country and society are fortunate."</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Advisory Committee Advocates Strictly Banning Electric Heating; Hiring Yu Qing and Other Health Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government Advisory Committee held its first meeting of this year at the municipal government at 3:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Yan Zhuanqing. Two points were discussed: The date for the repayment of principal and interest of the bonds issued by the former Public Works Bureau needs to be waited for until the liquidation is completed and submitted to the central government for announcement and implementation. Second, the shortage of power in the city has caused cotton mills to stop using electricity, which has greatly affected production.

<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Tang Mujun, who operated in an upstairs gambling den at No. 463 Min Guo Road, installed a red electric light upstairs because he feared being caught by police detectives for opium use. The switch was installed downstairs. If he saw anyone suspicious, he would turn on the red light from downstairs to warn the addicts to hide their paraphernalia and escape through the side door. The Yimiao Police Precinct discovered this and sent police detectives to raid the place on the 28th of last month. Due to the suddenness of the raid, Tang did not have time to turn on the red light and was arrested. Five other suspects, including Zhang Huiqing, were found next to the opium bed. All were transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday for trial. Judge Shao Renjie interrogated them. Tang admitted to using drugs, smoking about one mace (approximately 3.75 grams) of opium a day. However, he claimed that the red light was installed for burglar prevention because there was a safe upstairs. After the interrogation, Judge Shao ordered that Tang Mujun, Zhang Huiqing, and the other six be temporarily detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3>Xi'an Cracks Major Drug Smuggling Case; 138 Ounces of Morphine Seized; Two Masterminds Stayed in Beiping to Handle Goods</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, February 2] At the end of the year, Xi'an suddenly cracked a drug smuggling case involving air transportation, seizing 138 ounces of morphine, estimated to be worth around 2 billion national currency. In the cold ancient city, this incident is sensational. Especially because it was transported by air from Beiping to Shaanxi, and with the residents' rumors and exaggerations, it became even more lively.</p>
<p>The facts are as follows: On the night of January 28, more than ten members of the 14th Regiment of the Military Police stationed in Xi'an and police and local security personnel knocked on the door of No. 13 Xiaoxuexi Alley (on West Street in Xi'an). The home was inhabited by a widow, Guo Chushi, who was from Wen County, Henan, and was nearly fifty years old. She had been in Shaanxi for four years. According to her neighbors, Guo Chushi usually made a living by weaving cloth. However, on the night that the police and military police arrived at her home, they indeed seized five bags of morphine on the spot, weighing 114 ounces. She was arrested along with the drugs.</p>
<p>On the same night, three people were arrested in Minsheng Market, the commercial center of Xi'an. These people were all using the guise of setting up cloth shops. One of them, Chu Haozhi, was Guo Chushi's cousin. Another criminal, Chu Qingxi, was also a member of her clan. Before their arrest, police officers searched their residence and seized a bag of morphine weighing 24 ounces. It is said that when the police arrived at Chu's residence, only Yu Pu Xi was at home. After questioning, he confessed that Chu Haozhi and a man named Guo Daoqing had gone to a brothel in the National Market and had not yet returned. Thereupon, the police rushed there and apprehended the two men. At the same time, two small packages of morphine samples were found on the two men.</p>
<p>The so-called Guo Daoqing was also a relative of the Guo clan, and was usually engaged in the same industry and relatives often visited each other. At that time, there were two guests, Xue Yi Lai and Xue De Li, who frequented the market. They were well-dressed and behaved like wealthy merchants. After the villagers observed their actions, they talked with them, and over time, they became close friends, calling each other brothers. However, the two Xue never spoke about their own family matters, and did not tell others about these things. Their relationship was entirely based on money and wine.</p>
<p>After becoming very close, the two Xue took the opportunity to talk to Chu and Guo about ways to get rich, saying that shipping opium from Beiping to Xi'an would bring huge profits. Each shipment would bring at least a double profit. Chu, Guo, and the others were aimed at getting rich, so they were naturally unwilling to let this opportunity pass. They were delighted by the Xue's巧言誘導, and immediately decided to pool their resources, with each share being 50 million yuan, for a total of 500 million national currency. The two Xue then flew to Beiping to purchase the first batch of drugs, which arrived before the New Year. According to the original decision, it was handed over to Guo's sister and brother for safekeeping.</p>
<p>The 14th Regiment of the Military Police had already obtained information when the first batch of drugs arrived. They originally wanted to arrest all of them after the two Xue had transported the second batch of drugs, but unexpectedly, after the 22nd of last month, the weather snowed, and the cold currents were pressing. Due to air pressure reasons, flights to and from Xi'an were temporarily suspended. The Military Police authorities were afraid that things would change over time, so they arrested Chu, Guo, and the other criminals first. (Another claim is that the criminals intended to transport this batch of drugs to Lanzhou, thus hastening the Military Police authorities' cracking of the case).</p>
<p>The four criminals and all of the seized drugs were transferred to the Xi'an Municipal Government, and the criminals and their confessions were transferred to the Chang'an District Court. The court opened its first trial on January 31. Guo Chushi told the judge that it was true that drugs were found in her residence, but these things were temporarily left at her home by a fellow villager, Xue Yilai, six or seven days earlier. She herself did not realize what they were at the time, so she did not pay attention. When asked where Xue himself was now, she claimed "I don't know." Chu Qingxi confessed that he was also in contact with Ji Qirong, and when he was arrested and taken to the market, he saw Ji Qirong flee, and the details are unknown.</p>
<p>This case has only developed to this point, and the Chang'an District Court will investigate according to the law. According to a Xi'an evening newspaper: "According to the person in charge of cracking the case: 'The case involves a wide range, and those who have escaped will be strictly arrested...'" (Reporter Zhang Zhou)</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Camphor Company; Leakage from Main Oil Pipe Causes Loss of More Than Four Tons</h3>
<p>[Reported from Taipei, February 3] According to the person in charge of the Nanmen Factory, which belongs to the Taiwan Provincial Camphor Company: On the morning of the 18th of last month, it was suddenly discovered that the intermediate oil stored in the oil tank (that is, the intermediate oil from which camphor has been extracted) was leaking from the main pipe and flowing into Yongchun Stream. The person in charge of the factory immediately directed employees to actively filter it. After the incident, it was investigated that more than four tons had been lost, and the matter was reported to the relevant authorities for investigation.

<h3>Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, Runs for Vice President</h3>
<p>Li Zongren, who once created the unprecedented victory in the history of the War of Resistance at Taierzhuang and is the current Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, will run for Vice President at the National Assembly meeting on March 29 of this year after the implementation of the Chinese Constitution, at the urging of various parties. Li's achievements in revolutionary history and his political experience are highly praised by foreign public opinion. Li can be said to be an extremely suitable person to assist the President with outstanding military and political abilities. The following is a brief biography of Li: Li Zongren, courtesy name Delin, is 57 years old this year and is from Guangxi. Early in his schooling, he joined the revolutionary organization led by Sun Yat-sen. After graduation, he devoted himself to revolutionary battles and was wounded twice. From 1919 to 1921, he suppressed the remnants of Guangxi warlords. In 1922, he was appointed by Sun Yat-sen as the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner. In 1923, he defeated the rebel armies of Lu Rongting, Liu Zhenhuan, Shen Hongying, and others, laying the foundation for the revolution in Guangdong and Guangxi. In the autumn of that year, Li sent personnel to meet with Tang Jiyao, introducing Tang to join the revolutionary army. In the autumn of 1924, President Chiang led troops on the Northern Expedition, and Li was appointed commander of the 7th Army, which was invincible and known as the "Steel Army". In the Battle of De'an, he defeated Sun Chuanfang's main force. After the National Army entered Nanjing, Sun Chuanfang fiercely attacked Longtan, relying on Li to lead his troops in a bloody battle for seven days and nights, annihilating Sun's army. The National Government then established its capital in Nanjing.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1926, the government reorganized the army, establishing four military groups, with President Chiang, Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and Li serving as commanders-in-chief, respectively. Li was stationed in Wuhan, serving as chairman of the political branch. At that time, communist bandits in Hunan and Hubei rebelled, and Li's command was well-organized and quickly suppressed them. In 1928, Li led his troops back to Guangxi, determined to carry out construction, with great success. Both China and foreign countries響廣西爲中國模範省. Li's political talents were thus increasingly admired by the Chinese people. After the September 18 Incident, Li advocated resistance against Japan, and his "Scorched Earth Resistance Theory" was widely praised at the time. In 1937, when the War of Resistance broke out, Li and Bai Chongxi were summoned to Nanjing. After the evacuation of Shanghai and Nanjing, Li was stationed in Xuzhou as Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth War Zone. In the Battle of Taierzhuang, he annihilated the elite enemy troops of the Isogu and Itagaki divisions, enabling the National Army to部　武漢外國坚强之防务, and at the same time established the belief among people throughout the country that victory in the War of Resistance was certain. Chinese and foreign public opinion 成对. Mr. Biao praised the battle experience, resulting in盛誉. In the following seven years, Li led his troops in combat, repeatedly making outstanding achievements. After the victory, Li served as the Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters until today.</p>
<h3>Supervision and Conscription Committee Sends Personnel to Investigate; Changzhou Tianfeng Rice Mill Embezzles Air Force Grain</h3>
<p>[Reported from Wujin, February 2] Tianfeng Rice Mill in Xinqiao Street, this county, is one of the contract warehouses of the Field Grain Department. Recently, a conscription officer from the old Fourth District transported more than 150 bags of grain to the mill, but the mill did not issue a seven-part receipt as required, only a warehouse receipt, which prevented the officer from receiving 清串 at the Field Grain Department, causing a joke. It then embezzled more than 1,000 piculs of Air Force grain. The officer was anxious and tried to clear up the matter. It is reported that the Supervision and Conscription Committee sent personnel to investigate and found that the equipment was rudimentary. After checking the accounts and according to the warehouse report, there was still a shortage of more than 500 piculs. Dai Tiandao, the manager of the department, made excuses and was in Shanghai, avoiding seeing anyone, while his assistant答稱: the missing grain was on its way in Wuhu. Liu Yanyun, the resident factory officer sent by the Field Grain Department, did not often stay in the factory and also did not handle matters properly.</p>

<h3>Pingjiang Gold Cave Successfully Trials Production of Gold Liquid</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha, 31st (by airmail) report] The Pingjiang Gold Cave Mining Project in Hunan province has successfully trial-produced gold liquid, a substance widely used for decorating porcelain paintings and vessels for aesthetic purposes. In the past, China relied solely on imported products, resulting in substantial annual financial losses. In an effort to trial-produce gold liquid to reclaim these lost profits, Director Pan Zheng Gang of the project sought and obtained approval from the Provincial Department of Construction to establish a laboratory. Chemical engineer Shen Mingyang was appointed to lead the experiments. After dozens of dedicated trials, they finally achieved success on the 21st of last month, and the color and luster of the product are indistinguishable from imported goods.

Upon receiving the report, the Construction Department commended Director Pan Zheng Gang and Engineer Shen Mingyang for their contribution to the nation by successfully producing gold liquid, curbing financial losses, and reducing the need for foreign exchange. Regarding the request to establish a factory for large-scale production, the department has instructed them to submit a detailed report on the experimental gold liquid production method, the uses of gold liquid, sales channels, and cost calculations for further review and approval.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Merchants Seeing Out the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong, 1st (by airmail) report] The second snowfall in a century has brought the end of the lunar year Dinghai to Hong Kong. Although it is a bustling cosmopolitan city, most merchants here are still quite traditional. They are rushing to settle old accounts and see off the end of the year. When they talk about the year that is coming to a close, most of them shake their heads with bitter smiles, lamenting, "In decades, it hasn't been as bleak as this year!" It is said that the industrial raw material trading companies and the north-south trading companies dealing in seafood and sundry goods, which usually make a lot of money, have suffered particularly heavy losses. Only the hardware and paper businesses can be said to be barely stable.</p>
<p>Around the end of the year, social news has also been full of incidents. The extradition case of Xu Jizhuang has just passed, and the "Guangdong" transport ship running between Guangzhou and Hong Kong suddenly caught fire on the 31st of last month. Although only a small part of the main cabin was burned, passengers (mostly small-scale smugglers carrying New Year's goods to the province for the market) were eager to escape, and over thirty women, children and weak were pushed into the water and drowned. Last year, at the same time, there was also a tragic fire on the "Xi'an" ship, which killed and injured more than a hundred people. It's only four days away from the anniversary of the "Guangdong" fire. This unfortunate incident has attracted great attention from the transportation authorities. In the past, ships were the most important means of transportation between Hong Kong, and merchants gathered there. Now, with frequent accidents, everyone regards it as a dangerous route.</p>
<p>From today onwards, Hong Kong rickshaw pullers are ordered to wear uniforms, with the number of the rickshaw sewn on the clothing, and their hair must be cut short to show cleanliness. It is said that this is a measure taken by the police to facilitate the management of rickshaw pullers and to beautify the city. (Special Correspondent Shi Jian)</p>

<h3>"Two-Faced Informer" Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi, 2nd report] Zhi Yiyi, a "naturally intelligent" villager from the eighth district of Subei!, had been working for the bandits there. During the period when the National Army recovered the area, he immediately joined the Kuomintang, becoming a two-faced person. Last year, he suddenly secretly came to Wuxi and lived in Peijing Town, wearing a yellow military uniform and pretending to be an active-duty soldier. He colluded with a companion and a police student to extort money from wealthy households who had fled from the bandit-controlled areas to Wuxi, or from "independent" boats. Over the past year, he has committed numerous crimes. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense issued an arrest warrant for him. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, Zhi and his accomplice were extorting money from two boatmen from Subei, Zong Dechun and Shi Wensi, under the Wu Bridge. Because their plan was not well-conceived, Zhi and his accomplice were arrested and interrogated.</p>

<h3>Chen Zhenshan, Secretary of the County Assembly in Chenggu County, Southern Shaanxi, Assassinated; County Magistrate Meng Ruodong and Others Suspected and Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Baoji, 1st (by airmail) report] Last year was a difficult year for southern Shaanxi. The Zhen'an massacre shocked the whole country, and County Magistrate Sun Junbo is still in jail. Before the New Year, Chen Zhenshan, the secretary of the county assembly in Chenggu County, was assassinated. Although this incident happened a month ago, because Chenggu is far away from Xi'an, most people are still unaware of it.</p>
<p>At 9 pm on December 22nd last winter, Chen Zhenshan, the secretary of the Chenggu County Assembly, was assassinated in his residence. According to the investigation by the Chenggu County Police Department, there were seven or eight perpetrators, wearing yellow woolen uniforms. One of them shouted, "My name is Wu Zhen." It is said that Chen's residence was in the center of the county seat.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenshan was the secretary of the county assembly, and it is said that he had a good relationship with the county party headquarters. He was able to take the post of secretary of the county assembly mostly due to the assistance of the party headquarters. Several months before Chen's death, he once united with the county assemblymen, with himself taking the lead, to accuse County Magistrate Meng Ruodong of misappropriating 1.3 billion yuan, which greatly offended County Magistrate Meng. On the night of the tragedy, County Magistrate Meng went to the countryside to inspect construction work, accompanied by Yu Xianzhou, the person in charge of the county youth corps, and the local public security chief. Therefore, after the incident, there was speculation that County Magistrate Meng and Officer Yu's departure might have something to do with the case.</p>
<p>According to Chen's wife, when she reported the incident to the police department after the tragedy, she said, "Her husband lamented the bad environment in Chenggu before he was killed, and told her that someone wanted to harm him, and the masterminds were County Magistrate Meng Ruodong and Yu Xianzhou, the leader of the Youth Corps." As for what grievances Chen had with the two, general rumors revolved around the issue of stances. Because Chen was a party figure, he would of course help his own stance and friends during the general election, and therefore was deeply resented.</p>
<h3>Suspects Arrested, Eleven Witnesses Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>After the incident, the Sixth District Commissioner's Office of Shaanxi Province immediately launched an investigation and arrested suspects. Those who were taken into custody included Luo Tianhe, section chief of the Chenggu Police Department, Lian Cheng, the captain of the security police team, Officer Yu, conscription officer Lei Ming, and Officer Yu himself. County Magistrate Meng was also detained in the Nanzheng Commissioner's Office. While Lei Mingxing, Yu's guard, was being escorted from Chenggu to the Nanzheng Local Court, he allegedly confessed to himself, "Killing someone must be paid for with one's life!" It was originally said that the statement was unfounded, but with these remarks and actions after the fact, the subtle clues inevitably remind people of those rumors.</p>
<p>On the 17th of last month, the Nanzheng Local Court opened its first preliminary hearing to collect evidence and question the reasons, and summoned eleven witnesses, including the chief, inspector, police chief, and police officers from the Chenggu Police Department. In these people's statements, most of them revealed that the case was in fact related to those who had been detained.</p>
<p>The chief of the police department said, "Luo Tianhe and Lian Cheng were both bodyguards that County Magistrate Meng brought with him. County Magistrate Meng had previously established an "action team," and Luo, Lian, and a team member named Wang Wende were the main members of the team. Now, Wang Wende has disappeared." The guard on duty on the night of the incident also said that he had seen Luo Tianhe and Wang Wende wandering around Chen's residence before the incident occurred. After the incident, Luo returned to the police station, looking uneasy. Later, the police station received an anonymous letter containing the sentence: "The killer is evil, and the killed is also evil!" Luo Tianhe had also unintentionally said these two sentences in the office. As for Lian Cheng, he was originally the captain of the security police team, but he had never been to the team. However, on that night, he unexpectedly made an exception and returned to the team, and it is said that he was pale-faced and behaved abnormally.</p>
<p>In this day of constitutional government, the occurrence of this incident is unfortunate. However, the law is dignified and must not be let off. While the Shaanxi Provincial Government has had the court accept this case, it has sent personnel to assist the court in investigating the case. In the near future, the truth will surely come out and be revealed. (Reporter Qingmu)</p>
<p>The testimony of the police inspector, one of the witnesses, is important. He testified that two things were worth noting: 1. County Magistrate Meng and Chen Zhenshan had grievances over unpaid funds, and although Luo and Lian had no grievances with Chen, they were the county magistrate's personal bodyguards. 2. Although the rumors among the people of Chenggu are not enough to serve as evidence, clues may be heard from the rumors, so please pay attention to this point.</p>

According to the Ministry of Education, Dr. Qian Linzhao was previously commissioned to go to the United States to purchase approximately three million US dollars worth of educational equipment and materials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for distribution to major colleges and universities across the country that had been damaged by the war. Among them, the university can preferentially allocate equipment for science and engineering, including the first batch of AC generators, transformers, rectifiers, etc. In addition, Jiao Tong University can obtain three drilling machines, one gear cutting machine, three grinders, five lathes, three milling machines, and one shaping machine from the first batch of Japanese reparations, which are currently on their way to Shanghai. The Department of Electrical Engineering has also applied to the Ministry of Education for US funds to purchase generators, motors, microwave oscillators, electrical analyzers, and other items. The Ministry of Transportation has subsidized 130 million yuan to the Department of Physics for the purchase of a large number of instruments from American and domestic manufacturers. Jiao Tong University originally had a small-scale metalworking factory before the war to manufacture various experimental instruments and specially designed instruments. Now, various lathes, shaping machines, drilling machines, etc., have been transported around during the war and are now so corroded that they are unusable. The Ministry of Education has now drafted a plan to first construct a factory building on campus after the various mechanical equipment has been supplemented and organized, and then hand it over to the university to receive it as a factory building.</p>
<h3>China Education Research Association is an Illegal Organization; Pretends to Help Students But Has Other Intentions; Municipal Education Bureau Decides to Strictly Ban It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] After the Municipal Education Bureau exposed the inside story of the so-called "Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association's examination and sending of free students," the association suddenly published an advertisement yesterday in an attempt to confuse the public. A spokesperson for the Education Bureau issued another statement as follows: It has been verified that the "Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association" has not been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau and is originally an illegal organization. Most secondary school teachers and staff do not know about this organization, which is obviously a small number of people trying to use the name of the organization as a cover for political activities, and using free education as a slogan to use students as tools for their political activities. The government loves young people and encourages and helps poor students, and has already made every effort to do so. In addition to the municipal council stipulating free places, which the Bureau has ordered schools to comply with, it has also raised scholarships from social organizations, and planned funding methods. All private secondary schools also deeply understand this idea, and fully cooperate. Regarding the provision of free places, everyone can handle them in accordance with regulations, and there are absolutely no dissenting opinions among the faculty and staff. The "Secondary Education Research Association" itself has no preparation for free funds, but it has come up with the idea of ​​taking the power to allocate the free quotas of various schools, and sending people to various schools to coerce them to donate free quotas, and the association will send students to study. The Bureau has repeatedly received reports from various schools that the established free quotas are already regulated, so there is no need to ask the association to handle them. The association is generous with others' money and asks for it to be stopped. In the past, a very small number of schools did not understand the facts and allowed the association to send some students within the original free quotas, but after the Bureau exposed their inside story, they have withdrawn one after another. After comprehensively verifying the reports from all parties, it is determined that the association is organized by a small number of unruly people and is definitely not dedicated to helping students. Reading the advertisement published yesterday, it actually involves teachers' lives, in-kind distributions, year-end welfare, etc., which is becoming more and more irrelevant, and its conspiracy to have other intentions is becoming more and more obvious. In order to implement the consistent purpose of comprehensively managing and providing assistance to students, the Bureau has decided on its established policy to strictly ban the association and investigate its responsible persons. At the same time, it still strictly orders all schools to widely establish free quotas in accordance with regulations, in order to benefit poor students, and the scholarship unified review committee will give each school more scholarship places for poor students, so that every poor student in the city has the opportunity to go to school. Public and private schools, all sectors of society, and municipal authorities in this city have made the greatest efforts to solve the problem of students dropping out of school, which can be said to be meticulous. The "Secondary Education Research Association" does not raise funds or spend a penny, and uses the slogan of sending free students. Isn't it the most ridiculous and deceptive thing? It is hoped that students and all sectors of society can deeply understand this.</p>

<p>[Our Hong Kong Report] The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Sports Association (CSA) was previously unable to bring together various sports organizations due to constitutional issues, and its work in promoting sports could not proceed smoothly. Later, with the efforts of Mr. Chen Rongbai, a sports enthusiast, the outgoing chairman finally agreed, and Yan Chengkun announced his resignation. The five original members, South China Athletic Association, Chinese YMCA, Chung Sing Benevolent Society, Chinese Recreation Club, and Taikoo Recreation Club, agreed to amend the constitution, abolish the grading of associations joining the CSA, and invite Sing Tao SC, Kitchee SC, Eastern AA, Kwong Wah AA, China Motor Bus Co.

<p>At the same time, it was decided that in the future, football organizations (Football League), basketball organizations (Basketball League), etc., would not have department heads. Each association would only join the leagues, and the leagues would elect representatives to participate in the work of the CSA. Chen Rongbai consulted with the heads of each association based on these principles, and the eleven units agreed to join, realizing a great unity. Chen Rongbai then successfully retired.</p>

<h3>Bank of China's Overseas Remittances Revenue Exceeded 190 Billion Last Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The overseas remittances received by the Bank of China in December of the 36th year amounted to 40,904,218,198.30 yuan, of which 27,297,039,450.00 yuan came from New York and 9,838,646,334.30 yuan came from London, with the remaining amount coming from various ports in Southeast Asia. The national currency figure for overseas remittances in December was more than double that of November and ranked first among all months of last year. However, if converted into US dollars at the exchange rate, the overseas remittances in March ranked first, when the exchange rate was 12,000 yuan per US dollar. If calculated based on the March standard, the overseas remittances in December should have been over 100 billion, but now it is only over 40 billion, which is actually a significant decrease. The reason for the decrease is that the official exchange rate is quite different from the black market rate.</p>
<p>Overseas remittances are extremely important to the balance of international payments, and the government has always attached great importance to them. The Bank of China, which handles overseas remittances, has made every possible effort within its responsibilities, but in recent years, the results have not been as expected and have been decreasing day by day. The total overseas remittances received by the Bank of China throughout the year (36th year) amounted to only 190,007,904,532.82 yuan. January was 1,678,059,435.47 yuan, February was 8,275,745,552.46 yuan, March was 20,748,110,251.63 yuan, April was 20,271,587,804.50 yuan, May was 10,536,666,731.36 yuan, June was 3,843,290,734.95 yuan, July was 1,737,681,234.50 yuan, August was 8,928,804,166.90 yuan, September was 21,235,537,368.12 yuan, October was 34,616,974,458.64 yuan, November was 7,309,228,576.60 yuan, and December was 40,904,218,198.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stock Market Situation Unclear; Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Stable</h3>

<h3>Silver Shops in the City Actively Handling Registration; Can Resume Business After the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The various silver shops in the city are being re-registered and reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau and can resume business after the Lunar New Year. The industry's labor union has decided to publish an advertisement today to notify all silver shop employees who have been laid off to register with the union. The union will then gather them and send them to the industry association for selection and employment, with the hope of standardizing wages and working hours.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] According to news from the Ministry of Finance, the buying and selling of gold ornaments by silver shops is not prohibited as long as it does not violate the regulations on the management of the collection, exchange, and manufacture of gold ornaments by silver shops. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, considering that Article 4 of the original regulations only provides a general provision regarding the exchange of gold ornaments, has made slight revisions. The original gold needed for the manufacture of gold ornaments by silver shops should still be limited to being recycled from exchanged gold ornaments or entrusted by customers to convert their original gold. The government has not considered supplying original gold to silver shops.</p>
<h3>Excessive Commodity Tax Amount; Cement Association Provides Opinions to the Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The National Cement Association previously stated that the amount of commodity tax on cement for the first period of this year was set too high, and various factories could not afford it. They had telegraphed the Tax Administration and other departments, requesting a reduction. Yesterday, the association submitted three points to the relevant authorities of the Tax Bureau, requesting their adoption. The main points are recorded as follows: The Tax Administration's view that the tax amounts for neighboring regions should be consistent is considered by the association to be inconsistent with the actual situation. The association believes that the actual situation does not match because the selling prices in the two regions do have differences due to market supply and demand. Therefore, the tax amount should be assessed separately based on the actual wholesale prices in each region. The Tax Administration believes that the tax amount should be calculated based on the market wholesale price. However, there are usually two types of wholesale prices for goods: one is the factory wholesale price at which the factory sells to wholesalers, and the other is the wholesale price at which wholesalers sell to retailers. The nature of the two is different. To determine a reasonable tax amount, the standard for wholesale price should first be established. The association may be tasked with providing reliable figures for cement factory wholesale prices on a regular basis as a basis for adjusting the tax amount. When setting the tax rate, the actual situation of various industries should be taken into account, and efforts should be made to ensure that the amount is reasonable. Otherwise, the actual effect of the tax increase will not be achieved, and the manufacturers' ability to bear the burden will have been exhausted first.</p>
<h3>Various Yarn Factories Request Joint Cotton Purchase; Yarn Tube Association Has Considered It; And Assists in Solving the Problem of Purchasing Machinery and Materials</h3>

It is reported that the association has now decided to abolish the Jiangyin office and establish a Wuhu office.

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In order to understand our cotton needs, the relevant departments of the American Embassy invited Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, and Zhang Sili, Deputy Director of the Business Department, to meet and discuss the matter. They inquired in detail about the company's cotton inventory, cotton needs, and types of cotton needed. It is said that the information from the discussion will be used as a reference for the United States to supply cotton to us.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Sharply, Cloth Prices Follow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by relaxed credit among traders, and the Textile Construction Company did not announce prices several times, so various parties absorbed heavily, and the number of chips became increasingly scarce. In addition, the sellers held firm, and market prices rose sharply. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn broke through the 60 million yuan mark midway, reaching a high of 62 million yuan. Near the close, many floating profits were taken, and the result was 61.7 million yuan, a further increase of 2.8 million yuan compared with the previous day. Jin Cheng also rose sharply by 3 million yuan. Due to the significant losses of the Shenxin factory, those covering short positions for 11-count horse spot yarn rose one after another, ending at a new high price. Other counts of combed fine yarn also rose in unison, from 1 million to 2.78 million.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 112 bales, equivalent to 221 bales of 20-count yarn. There were 50 applications, and the 20 large airships sold for 34.75 million yuan, reaching the price limit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw active buying from new customers in the morning, and there was also absorption in the local market. Brokers mostly focused on purchasing warehouse receipts. Among various cloths, fine cloth was particularly favored by buyers. Northern traders absorbed trumpet boy fine cloth outside the market. As a result, 12-pound fine cloth of various brands rose by 45,000 to 67,000 yuan compared with the previous day. In addition, the quoted prices for plain straight cloth, bleached cloth, twill cloth, colored cloth, and shilin cloth also showed progress.</p>
<p>Active Spot Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to be firm. Due to the sharp rise in cotton yarn, Rong Zhong saw a surge in demand. Sellers held firm, and transactions were stalled. Credit among non-industry players was generally loose, and scattered buyers absorbed the market, pushing prices up by 100,000 yuan, with 494 bales changing hands. The factory delivery price for Hankou coarse lint was 4.6 million yuan, and the warehouse delivery price for Hankou fine lint was 5.332 million yuan, Hankou coarse lint was 4.53 million yuan, and the price for Zhoupu cottonseed was 1.27 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Rise, Factory Management Exhausted and Unable to Revive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market continued to rise. 120-count Asahi brand glossy rayon opened in the morning at around 84.5 million yuan. Market sentiment was good, and buying interest was not weak. The market closed at 80 million yuan at noon, and then rose again in the afternoon, once reaching 91 million yuan. Finally, the selling price was quoted at 90 million yuan, a sharp increase of 5 million yuan compared with the previous day.</p>
<p>The factory silk market fell again yesterday, and the market was exhausted and unable to revive. C-grade silk was traded at 87 million yuan, with a two- or three-day premium. High-grade spot silk was 5 million yuan, medium-grade spot silk was 3 million yuan, and the next grade was around 1 million yuan. Dry silk had no transactions, and the quoted price fell accordingly.</p>
<p>The silk market was firm and stable yesterday. Strong raw silk quilt covers rose first and then fell back. At the opening, transactions of 1 million yuan and 100,000 yuan each were made, and then they immediately fell, with the smallest drop falling within the 40 million yuan mark, to 9.6 million yuan. The market closed slightly higher, with a quoted price of 40 million yuan. At the opening, Big Cheng checkered crepe was quoted at 167,000 yuan and was in demand. Later, the first high price of 850,000 yuan was traded. Other goods had clear transactions, and prices were quite firm.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Nine Kinds of Hardware and Other Items; Pricing and Distribution Based on CIF</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau recently released a message stating that the Committee for Reviewing Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange Arrival Goods has decided on the issue of how to price and distribute the supplementary hardware items based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price. A total of twenty-nine kinds are included, including anchors, pig iron and iron bricks, scrap iron, copper, lead wire, ribbed steel, various small nails and screws, and metal products listed in Zhu's list. The markups range from a minimum of 40% to a maximum of 100%, with steel pipes being 110%.</p>
<p>It is also understood that if there are different CIF prices for the same type of goods, and the difference is too large, merchants can apply for purchase and distribution based on the reasonable CIF price of similar goods after providing proof.</p>
<h3>Sericulture Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Hope for Cost-Based Purchase of Factory Silk</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly requested the Sericulture Industry Association of the Three Districts to convene a members' meeting, demanding that the Silkworm Cocoon Association purchase factory silk based on the actual cost of silk merchants and fulfill its promise of guaranteeing principal and interest. In the spring of the 36th year, the government stipulated that each dan of fresh cocoons should be calculated at the price of four shi of rice. In the autumn, it was rigidly stipulated that each dan should be 1.08 million yuan. At that time, silkworm farmers were unwilling to sell the full amount due to cost considerations, and most manufacturers had to increase the price appropriately to maintain the silkworm farmers' capital, so they secretly subsidized a great deal, which the authorities also knew early on. The fuel allocated by the Coordination Association was insufficient for use in each hall, and they all sought it on the black market, increasing costs. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, various factories need funds urgently. They hope that the Coordination Association will pay and hire according to the actual cost. Otherwise, they are willing to return the loans and recover the raw silk they handed over for free trade.</p>
<h3>Store Sales are Brisk, Rice Reappears Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 8,300 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. With snow fluttering, store sales were brisk, and the market was lively, regaining strength. Nong rice increased sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and Baiyuan also rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The ups and downs were entirely due to weather conditions. The same was true for flour, which also rose slightly by 30,000 to 50,000 to 10,000 yuan. There were still many bran supplies, and the market was flat and stable, lacking the power to rise.</p>
<p>Bean cake sales were active among retail customers, rising by 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories absorbed the market, and customers inquired. The local market was dry and fragrant, turning from weak to strong, rebounding by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Soybeans were firm in the customer's mind, rising by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Red beans were sold firmly by sellers, rebounding by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Silkworm beans were selling blandly, with little activity in the market.</p>
<p>Red sorghum was firm. Northern corn sales were brisk, with strong buying interest, rising sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Sesame sales were sporadic and active, rebounding by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Black sesame remained flat and stable. Raw peanuts were replenished by local businesses, and transactions were lively, turning from weak to strong, rebounding by 60,000 to 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market strengthened, and the market situation rose. Soybean oil rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil also increased by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Clear oil also rose by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Raw oil rose rapidly by more than 100,000 yuan, becoming slightly weak near the close.</p>
<p>Reissuance of Tobacco Leaf Tax Certificates</p>
<p>Not Approved by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Trade Association stated that the quantity of tobacco leaves destroyed in Xuchang by various tobacco leaf merchants was considerable, and the losses were enormous. The destroyed tobacco leaves had all been subject to commodity tax. In order to compensate for the huge losses, they had previously submitted a document to the Commodity Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, stating that the tobacco leaves had not yet been shipped out of the country and requesting assistance. The original tax certificates should continue to be used, and the destroyed stamps and tax certificates should be reissued. It is now learned that the industry association received a reply from the Tax Department, stating that according to tax law, tax certificates can only be used once, and destroyed stamps and certificates should be invalidated, and reissuance is not allowed, so the request should not be considered. The industry association will submit another application.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tea Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sellers in the tea market still held the idea of speculating and selling at high prices due to the shrinking inventory of various goods, which was greater than in the past. However, due to the narrow buying capacity of exporters, the process of export tea was quiet. As for domestic sales of various types of tea, the local market and customer's purchases continued unabated, and the buying momentum continued in both directions. In this situation, prices moved straight forward, and by the close, they had all risen compared to the previous closure.</p>
<h3>Export Control Conference Discuss Trade Controls</h3>
<p>The Export and Import Management Committee held a meeting in the morning, presided over by Chairman Huo himself. It is understood that Chairman Huo is paying close attention to the current trade control system and will propose a concrete revision method in the short term. It is said that the most important aspects of the current trade control are three: How to make the technicalities of limited import allocation more reasonable; How to make the review of non-quota imports more appropriate; How to effectively implement export certification. The Export and Import Management Committee is also paying attention to whether to open up self-prepared foreign exchange. The official has denied reports that the government will revise its import and export policy, saying that the government is currently strengthening the control of existing policies, and it is impossible to make major changes to the current control policies. As for the parent-child export linkage, the official believes that it is difficult to implement because the government's foreign exchange revenue will lack sources after the linkage.</p>

<h3>Essentials of Indian History</h3>
<p>— Lu Yuan</p>
<p>Edited by Li Zhichun, published by Zhengzhong Bookstore</p>
<p>India is adjacent to our country, and both have the reputation of being ancient civilizations. Whether in the past or present, India shares many similarities with our country in history. The exchange between Chinese and Indian cultures started earlier than with any other country. According to Chinese books, cultural exchange between China and India began more than two thousand years ago. In these two thousand years, the two countries have always maintained friendly relations without any hostility, which is a rare phenomenon in world history.</p>
<p>In recent years, the relationship between China and India has become increasingly close. We are concerned about the development of the situation in India, and Indian people are equally concerned about our China. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Chiang's visit to India and Nehru's visit to China were of great significance. There are many articles on Indian issues in domestic newspapers and magazines, but most of them focus on the exploration of current issues, and few systematically introduce Indian history. Because compiling a history is extremely difficult, especially after the cultural catastrophe of World War II, and the Indian nation itself has never paid much attention to its own history, making the collection of Indian historical materials even more difficult. The lack of a relatively complete history of India in our country is not because historians do not pay attention to Indian history, but because there is no complete Indian historical material available for them to compile. Recently, Zhengzhong Bookstore published "An Outline of Indian History" edited by Li Zhichun, which I feel is worth introducing.</p>
<p>Li's "An Outline of Indian History" is compiled based on Oxford's Indian history textbook and his research experience in India. The content of this book is rich and the writing is popular and fluent, which goes without saying. The author is also able to gradually analyze various factors in Indian history using deductive methods, and then discuss them using inductive methods, so that readers can have a new understanding and speculation about India's past, present, and future after reading this book.</p>
<p>The Indian nation is very complex, but it can be mainly divided into two major systems: Aryan and Tamil, from the north and south. The Indian nation has more than four or five thousand years of recorded history, but in these four or five thousand years, their various ethnic groups have never united, and that was true in the past, and it is still true now. Because of the divisions between ethnic groups, India has a tragic fate. In their entire history, except for the Aryans who once established "India for the Indians," they have almost always been ruled by foreigners. The author clearly describes in this book that this is caused by the "Indian disease" of the Indian nation's lack of unity.</p>
<p>Indian culture was once brilliant, but these superior cultures have not yet been valued and understood by Europeans. In the eyes of Europeans, India is just an uncivilized barbarian nation. Only we Chinese can defend her against this erroneous and insulting view, just as the author says: Only we Chinese understand and appreciate the true Indian culture. A barefoot Chinese monk understands Indian culture more thoroughly than English gentlemen. This view is very correct.</p>
<p>India has been devastated by many wars, but its four to five thousand years of culture has been preserved, thanks to the power of religion. India was defeated on the battlefield, but not in culture. Although the various states and tribes in India are scattered and disunited, they have a unified culture, which invisibly enables the various states and tribes to gradually move towards unity. Now that India is independent, the struggles between tribes are still fiercely ongoing, but many Indians are working hard to cure this "Indian disease." I believe that soon, India will become a complete country, as the author says.</p>
<p>The author divides the entire book into five parts and thirty-three chapters, with approximately 120,000 words. He divides Indian history into five periods:</p>
<p>1.  Prehistoric Period: Refers to the period before Indian culture has verifiable history, or the cultural period of the indigenous peoples of India.</p>
<p>2.  Ancient History Period: That is, the Vedic period and the Hindu dynasty period.</p>
<p>3.  Middle History Period: The period of rule by the Afghans and Muslims.</p>
<p>4.  Modern History Period: The Mughal Empire period when the descendants of Timur invaded India.</p>
<p>5.  Contemporary History Period: From the arrival of Europeans in the East and the decline of India to the period of national awakening and national revival.</p>
<p>In these five periods, the author describes the ancient history in particular detail, because the ancient history period was the time when Indian culture and all social systems were established. In the ancient history period, we can explore the origins of Indian culture. In modern history, the author omitted the chapter on India under British rule and the independence movement. Now that the flag of Indian independence is flying high, the independence movement can be considered to have come to an end. In order to complete the book, it is hoped that the author can add it in the reprint.</p>
<h3>Collection of Essays on Mental Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Huang Shishu</p>
<p>Written by Zan, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>The author uses fluent writing to discuss the functions and importance of mental hygiene from various aspects, advocating mental hygiene. His attitude is scientific. Every question must start with case studies, and conclusions must be meticulous. His discussion of the difference in blood pressure between Europeans and Americans and Chinese people is an example. Naturally, we do not think that his views are completely agreeable. For example, he explains that a young person's fainting who is dissatisfied with their family is a protest against their father. Of course, we cannot say that it is impossible, and we even admit that fainting allows this young person to cope with the situation at the time, but it does not necessarily have to be said that this is a protest against their father. We believe that if a "sufficient" explanation can be found, there is no need to find a "tortuous" one, and if a more common explanation can be used, there is no need to look for a more circuitous explanation.</p>
<p>The author opposes attributing everything to heredity, "because this is a lazy and irresponsible approach." Incidentally, attributing everything to heredity is somewhat like some philosophers attributing everything to God. In the end, it not only becomes a "garbage can," but also becomes quite vague, empty, and becomes a mysterious thing.</p>
<p>He is not biased. He wants to "liberate himself from traditional sectarian prejudices and misunderstandings" (page 5). In the article "The Development of Modern Medical Psychology," he gives Freud a fairly fair evaluation. He acknowledges the limitations of Freud's theories and methods, believing that Freud overemphasized biological instincts and ignored the normative role of the cultural environment on human behavior, and that his concept of development remained somewhat stuck in a mechanical interpretation. But he points out that Freud's theories are not, as some people say, entirely metaphysical speculation, but the crystallization of empirical clinical experience. Freud discovered the dynamic function of the subconscious in human behavior—especially pathological behavior—and abandoned the one-sided tendency in psychiatric research towards physical research and turned to psychological understanding, discovered the importance of childhood, and provided developmental research methods.</p>
<p>The author also said elsewhere that "human beings are not only physiological, but also psychological. It is not scientific enough to study human physiological phenomena in isolation from the influence of psychological factors. Therefore, human health is unified in body and mind, and cannot be separated." He also stated that he was "dissatisfied with using a simple stimulus-response (S.R.) formula to explain human behavior" because "it ignores the active and positive functions of the reactor's cognitive process and the social and cultural significance attached to the stimulus itself, and these functions and meanings not only determine the content of people's reactions, but also are the main driving force for human beings to recognize the environment and transform the environment."</p>
<p>He emphasizes the environment, believing that heredity "only provides a possible trend of development, and we can still use human power to transform this trend!" He pays attention to cultural factors. This is evident everywhere in this collection. He believes that the formation of a personality has three factors: one is the individual's biological mechanism, the second is the requirements of culture, and the third is the individual's selective process of absorbing culture.</p>
<p>Because the author values cultural factors, he not only points out that many diseases are often caused by psychological factors, but also believes that mental illness is related to cultural factors, and that mental hygiene must first transform culture. We strongly agree with this view. Mental hygiene workers, if they do not recognize this premise, will not be able to grasp the causes and treatments of many mental illnesses. The author certainly stated that he valued childhood life experiences, but he believed that to understand the meaning of symptoms, "we should understand the patient's entire personality structure and the process at the time of illness."</p>
<p>He says, "We only make faithful descriptions of the special facts we have discovered and explore its causes and effects. We do not use partial facts as a universally applicable extrapolation." For example, the same symptoms may have different causes. If we apply the conclusions obtained from a case study to all cases with similar symptoms without limitation, we will make mistakes. The facts and conclusions of mental hygiene cases cannot be generalized and applied without limitation because each individual's life experience is different. However, there are more or less similar aspects, so mental hygiene cases still have reference value.</p>
<p>From the above standpoint, he studied issues such as "the Way of Father and Son" and "Between Men and Women." He says, "There are no children with behavioral problems if there are no parents with psychological problems." There are several articles in this book about "Between Men and Women." He points out that this issue "is not only very important in the premarital life of young people, but also in the post-marital family life, the psychological adaptation of men and women is still not to be ignored." He analyzes "the confusion of young people," women's hostility towards men, and so on. In short, sexual issues are extremely important. "Sex has long become a taboo in our society, and theocratic thought and feudal morality have added another layer of mystery to it. As a result, people cannot easily gain scientific knowledge of it like other bodily functions. But it is indeed a part of people's bodily functions, and it is a relatively important part that affects people's physical and mental development. The fact is also forcing people to deal with the many problems caused by this function. As a result, vague understanding, curious secret exploration, the sin of social taboos, and religious feelings of uncleanliness all continue to create emotional anxiety in people. This is the crux of the impact of sexual issues on mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the mystery of sexual issues now, and let scientific knowledge help us rationally deal with the problems caused by sexual function. This should be given special attention in our country's educational facilities."</p>
<p>The reason why we want to study these issues is to make everyone psychologically sound. The "main goal" of treating mental patients is "to enable patients to obtain reasonable and sound methods to restore their psychological balance." "The object of mental hygiene research is the pathological psychological phenomena that people have accumulated and developed in real life, so it particularly emphasizes the study of the entire human psychological process and the social and cultural environment in which people live."</p>
<p>In short, "Collection of Essays on Mental Hygiene" is a book with insightful and useful ideas. People who are interested in psychology can take a look, and young people and parents may also want to read it. Mental hygiene is extremely important. Many social problems are often problems of individual psychological pathology. It is hoped that other books of similar nature will continue to emerge.</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>— Tongxian</p>
<p>The assassination of Mr. Gandhi shocked the world. The Indian nation has a bit of mystery. In order for us to have a deeper understanding of India, this issue specially introduces a book about Indian history, hoping to attract readers' attention. Recently, there have been two other noteworthy events: one is that students of Tongji University went on strike and petitioned, leading to Mayor Wu being beaten; the other is that Shanghai dancers held a meeting and petitioned, leading to the Social Affairs Bureau being smashed. The former is related to the cultivation of young people, and the latter is related to the psychology of the masses. Therefore, we also introduce the book "Mental Hygiene" as a reference for everyone's self-cultivation and research.</p>
<p>From many of the recent submissions we have received, we have discovered a gratifying fact: there are many articles introducing scientific, mathematical, and historical books. Readers can also see this fact from the recent issues of the publishing industry. We still hope that domestic scholars and scientists will introduce the latest famous foreign scientific works to us. Conversely, we also feel that there are too few good manuscripts introducing literary works. We hope that literary writers will introduce excellent literary books to us.</p>
<p>Chinese writers have a habit of often being proud of being asked for manuscripts. I do not agree with this point. Especially for publications like ours that introduce books, reputable writers should regard guiding younger generations or exchanging knowledge as their duty. We do not ask reputable writers for manuscripts, but we very much hope that they will automatically introduce the good books they have read to us, so that they can be shared with others or help young people in their studies.</p>
<h3>Review and Introduction to "Outline of the Chinese Constitution"</h3>
<p>— Ye Qiuyuan</p>
<p>(Edited by Yu Kun, published by Zhonghua Book Company, the whole book has 310,000 words, priced at nine yuan.)</p>
<p>In the January 1948 issue of the "Foreign Affairs Quarterly," there was an article by George W. Mallory, an American scholar of Chinese history, entitled "China's New Constitution," which praised our country's newly implemented constitution. He began by saying: "The new constitution passed by the National Assembly of the Republic of China on December 25, 1946, was implemented on December 25, 1947. This new constitution is the most democratic constitution, which is more democratic than most people expected, because the constitutional history of the country has suffered many setbacks." But he also said in the conclusion: "From the situation in 1947, it can be seen that in recent years, there has been great progress in political theory; if the government does not make major and thorough reforms in administration, then this new constitution is nothing more than a beautiful piece of writing."</p>
<p>We have studied the constitutions of various countries and know that each has its own advantages, and at the same time, we also know that each has its own shortcomings. There is no absolute superiority or inferiority in political systems, only relatively good or bad, but the most important thing is that it is practical and easy to implement. Speaking of our country's new constitution, not to mention that domestic political scientists unanimously praise it; even political scholars from all over the world, as long as they have insight into our country's political situation, all recognize that it is a democratic and progressive constitution. If these 175 articles can be implemented, then our country's constitutional government will have a bright future. Therefore, the current problem is no longer the quality of the constitution, but whether the constitution can be effectively implemented.</p>
<p>The so-called constitution is the fundamental law of the country that the whole country must abide by, and not only must the government implement it effectively, but also the people of the whole country must be able to understand the content of the constitution and everyone must be able to understand the spirit of the law. Only in this way can a true constitution be realized. However, our country has 450 million people, and illiteracy accounts for a very large percentage. Even those who know literature do not know what the constitution is at all. How can we hope that all the people of the country can abide by the constitution? Some people say that we can say that we are in the stage of learning about democratic constitutionalism, and we can only seek progress in learning. We completely agree with this statement, but the most important step in learning democracy and learning constitutionalism is to understand the content and spirit of our country's new constitution.</p>
<p>The Chinese publishing industry has a dazzling array of works on the constitution, but there are not many that are suitable for university teaching and general reference; recently, Zhonghua Book Company published Mr. Yu Kun's "Outline of the Chinese Constitution," which seems to have value in introducing it to the readers of this newspaper. The book has a total of 310,000 words and is divided into eleven chapters: Introduction; Tracing the History of Constitution-Making in China; The Process of Drafting the Constitution of the Republic of China; The Constitutional Movement during the War of Resistance Against Japan; Before and After the Political Consultative Conference; The Convening of the National Assembly and the Completion of the Constitution-Making Work; The Spirit of the Chinese Constitution; The Central Political System; Local System; People's Rights and Obligations; The Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution; Appendix: The Constitution of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>This work has many characteristics, but due to space limitations, it cannot be described in detail, but the most important ones are two. First, regarding the process of constitution-making in our country, the author stands on an objective position and makes an unbiased description; from the Political Consultative Conference to the National Assembly's enactment of the constitution, there are detailed records, which can often be read as a modern Chinese political history. Second, the author has a solid theoretical research on the constitution, and is especially familiar with the political systems of various countries, so he uses the theory and practice of constitutional government in various countries to explain the characteristics of our country's constitution, which makes it particularly clear. In short, this book is worth recommending to readers.</p>
<h3>Chemical Essence</h3>
<p>— Li Tishi</p>
<p>(Written by Wu Ruinian, published by Zhonghua Book Company)</p>
<p>There are many physics and chemistry textbooks, but there are very few books for comprehensive review. Even if there are one or two, most of them only collect exercises, provide answers, and call them review books. Chemistry is the most complex and miscellaneous of all sciences. General textbooks, of course, do not lack systematic and clear descriptions, but because the scope of chemistry is too broad, students find it difficult. This "Chemical Essence" is indeed the most valuable auxiliary book to date, suitable for review and reference, and can also be used as a concise chemistry dictionary. Students can get a clear outline after reading this book in addition to studying chemistry, which is helpful for learning chemistry.</p>
<p>The compilation of this book is original to the author, Mr. Wu Ruinian. It discards the usual formal order and uses inductive and comprehensive methods, dividing it into six parts. The first part is the explanation of definitions, laws, and aliases. All chemical definitions and laws are arranged in Roman alphabetical order and explained. The explanation of aliases is rarely seen in other books, which is a feature of this book. The so-called alias is the common names of those chemical manufacturing products that we usually call, such as alcohol, asphalt, calcium carbide, etc., explained with English names and detailed explanations, and listed with chemical molecular formulas. This part has left the classroom scope and entered daily life, which is more interesting.</p>
<p>The second part is non-metals and their compounds, which are classified by elements of the same valence, and each individual element or compound is described in a single section. The characteristic of this part is the emphasis on the combination of "valence," that is, all elements of the same valence are combined together. The third part is metal elements, which are divided according to the tribal properties of the metals, and the elements of the same tribe are grouped together and then divided into sections. The fourth part is organic compounds, which are also classified and described in the same way.</p>
<p>The fifth part, Chemical Dissociation, is a question-and-answer section created by the author himself, divided into seven categories according to their formal differences, such as distinction questions, descriptive questions, etc., each with answers. Strictly speaking, the answers to these exercises are useful for reference, but judging from the style of the whole book, this part is not necessary. Having it does not add to the book, and removing it is not a loss to the scholars.</p>
<p>The sixth part, Chemical Calculations, is also divided into six different types of chemical calculations, each with examples to illustrate. The exercises included in this aspect are too simple and do not match the content in front, and scholars are not satisfied, but the classification is detailed, the writing is concise, and the answers are particularly clear, which is more than enough for middle school students to refer to.</p>
<p>The first part of this book, the explanation of definitions, laws, and aliases, is rarely seen in current chemical books and can be used as a chemistry dictionary for reference, which is very useful. In addition, the second and third parts describe each element very simply. The author uses a quick knife to cut through the mess, dividing each into "discovery," "existence," "preparation," "properties," and "uses," and explaining each item, directly and straightforwardly, which is very commendable. For general students to cope with exams, the fifth and sixth parts are quite convenient, but in terms of value, the first four parts are the most important, especially the explanation of aliases in the first part, combined with the elements in the middle two parts, can simply be used as a self-study or common sense reader, which is the greatest value of this book.</p>
<p>There are also unsatisfactory aspects of this book, that is, the lack of chemical theory, which the author says he has included in the first part, in the explanation of names. However, including it in the explanation of definitions, laws, and aliases is not satisfactory, especially more advanced theories, there is no reason why this book should not have included them in another part.</p>
<p>The compilation of this book should be an attempt, a progressive, new reform and creation in the publication of chemistry books, which is worth studying and promoting. According to this style, it is hoped that a more detailed, more advanced, and more complete "Chemical Essence" will be published for students above middle school to use.</p>
<h3>Reading "Phoenix Garden"</h3>
<p>— Ye Ping</p>
<p>By Shi Jimei, published by Dazhong Publishing House</p>
<p>In her "Postscript," the author humbly says, "...The impatiens flowers bloomed, but without fragrance, and the flowers were not pretty, nor were the colors beautiful; but because they were planted by my own hand, I became a little biased... In my mother's camphor wood chest, there are still treasured tiger-head shoes that we wore in our childhood, and a small cotton-padded jacket with blue plums and kingfisher green embroidery, already worn and old, and a small Turkish hat bought by my father, also worn out, and a boy scout uniform washed until it's faded... These things are long useless and should be thrown away, but why are they still kept? It's not just being stingy; it at least reveals some foolishness, but why keep them? Perhaps it's for this little bit of foolishness that, sometimes, I imagine this heavy camphor wood chest as a crystal memory box, storing countless yesterdays and last night's moons, suns, stars, and years. Then, in an instant, these useless things that should be discarded suddenly feel precious, just like storing these old clothes, just like keeping those humble impatiens flowers. I sorted out the manuscript of 'Phoenix Garden' with extreme anxiety and shyness." "Phoenix Garden" is Shi Jimei's first collection, including ten short stories and two novellas.</p>
<p>Just like her poetic and beautiful "Postscript," each of her novels is the same. Her joy and preferences are poetic, and her sorrow is also beautiful. Therefore, her novels are close to prose, or even poetry. The first impression after reading "Phoenix Garden" is that the author should not be a novelist. If she engaged in the creation of poetry and prose, she would achieve greater success.</p>
<p>From a writing technique perspective: "Phoenix Garden" is the most successful, with a precise structure, delicate descriptions, gorgeous literary talent, and mysterious colors, all of which capture the reader's emotions. "Three Years" and "The Victory of Love" are two moving stories, but the arrangements are a bit cliché. Here, the author expresses more of her self-ideal: noble sympathy and great self-sacrifice. "Purple Poppy" is also similar, but the character portrayal outweighs the story narration, so although there are no bizarre or convoluted plots, it is more gentle and moving. "Qin Linliu" and "Xiao Bu Dian'er" also focus on personality description. The most lovely is "Xiao Er's Melancholy." "Dream Seeker" is a prose poem from beginning to end. "Blue Angel" describes the psychology of a vain girl. "The Fool's Joy" narrates the poor life of a poor teacher. "Spring of the Earth" is set in the countryside and could be a good creation, but reading it, one feels that the writing lacks a kind of earthy气息, probably due to the author's detachment from the living environment.</p>
<p>Each piece in "Phoenix Garden" is young, is the brilliance of youth, but not the light and heat of youth. The author's touch is like a gentle guitar, not a bright horn; like a slow stream, not a roaring ocean; and like a bright window and clean table, a spotless room, filled with fresh flowers, antiques, and elegant landscapes and ancient books, but without brooms or rags—those dirty, annoying things, but sometimes they are necessary. "...They all dream more than they realize; they can create beautiful mirages, but rarely have great achievements; they have the art of living, but lack the common sense of living; they all can 'understand elegant meaning from string music,' but cannot 'rise at the crowing of the rooster'..." Perhaps Mrs. Feng's words in "Phoenix Garden" are the best description.</p>
<p>Although we don't therefore think that the author is useless or that the work is empty, on the contrary, we only feel that the author is frank and detached. Her work is pure, skilled, and sincere, because she dedicates the purest part of her soul to the reader, without pretense or restraint. Although it lacks a kind of soaring power, it does not whine without illness. Although dissatisfied with reality, it is not pessimistic. She dreams of mirages without ever losing heart, seeming to strive to create a Platonic Utopia or Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring. She has many friends, like-minded people, and she believes that this dream will one day succeed. The author seems to have this kind of optimism. As for those who are not friends and things outside the Peach Blossom Spring, she is not ignorant, but she views them with indifference and treats them with silence.</p>
<p>Therefore, young people love her works, especially the unblemished young people, naturally love her advantages, gorgeous writing, poetic atmosphere, pure ideals... But what is even more loved by young people is her weaknesses: her thirst and unease, her warmth towards humanity, her love for dreams, her simple heart and profound philosophy, her frank and mysterious, skilled and lonely, strong and timid soul, as well as her contradictory views on people and things. Her weaknesses are more able to grasp the emotions of young people than her strengths, because she is as unblemished as they are. What they want to say, what they want to say, is these things, and she has already written them for them.</p>

<h3>Dancing and Marriage</h3>
<p>— Wang Kao</p>
<p>Recently, the central government's explicit order to disband dance halls has caused quite a bit of criticism from the industry. We won't discuss the rights and wrongs of each other, but now we'll provide a material that can be considered interesting:</p>
<p>In Dr. Hu Shi's study abroad diary, volume 3, there is an entry on January 4th, year 3 of the Republic of China: "The position of women in our country is higher than that of women in the West." (Original book, volume 1, page 154) "Suddenly, I think that the position of women in our country is actually higher than that of women in the West. Our country takes care of women's chastity and reputation, and does not allow them to be burdened by marriage themselves. All marriages are decided by parents. Men are born to build homes, and women are born to manage homes. Women do not need to dedicate themselves to social interactions for the sake of marriage, seeking their own spouses in a busy manner, so they value women's personality. The West is not like this. When women grow up, seeking a spouse is their business. Parents then teach them music and dance, and then let them go out to interact with men. Those who can please men, or who can use tricks to drive men into their clutches, are the first to find a spouse; those who are too strong and simple, or who are unwilling to humiliate themselves to please others, remain unmarried as old maids for life. Therefore, sacrificing women's personality and driving them to dedicate themselves to fishing for men's hearts is the sin of freedom of marriage in the West." Then, it goes on to say: "This argument may be too radical, but I am confident that it is not without basis. Those who examine it in its subtleties should not dismiss it as stubborn and old-fashioned."</p>
<p>The above, although it represents Mr. Hu's early great theory of seeing the "subtleties," in fact, I cannot agree with it. At least, Mr. Hu is academic and logical. This kind of argument that represents the whole with a part—or even a point—cannot be said to be not falling into error. The second volume of the original book, when discussing "Xie Fan's Theory of the Extinction of the Soul," committed the same error and was pointed out by Mr. Hu. This shows that Mr. Hu was not ignorant, but deliberately pretended to be coy. If Chinese women don't go dancing and don't go socializing, and that's considered high character, then "inner words do not leave the boudoir, and outer affairs do not enter the door," and "men and women do not touch hands when giving and receiving" should also be respected as valuing women. If we extend this further, men can take concubines, and women are solely machines for passing on the family line; can't we also say the same thing? We shouldn't be surprised either. A little later, Mr. Lin Yutang, in "Glimpses of Peking," talked about the aesthetic principles of bound feet and the family harmony of concubinage. However, Mr. Lin's purpose was to show off his strangeness, and his ultimate goal was to make his works one of the bestsellers. This is his Practicalism, which is somewhat forgivable. Mr. Hu's argument is probably not like this. Because his marriage was old-fashioned, arranged by his mother, and Hu was filial to his mother and couldn't bear to divorce, he made this self-deception of Ah Q. The second volume of the same book has a paragraph discussing marriage issues, which mentioned the reasons for not divorcing, which can be used as proof.</p>
<p>Seeking a mate is a biological requirement, not limited to humans. Peacocks open their screens when they see females, and pheasants wag their tails and make sounds. There is no question of "chastity and reputation" here. Mr. Hu, who studied agriculture at Cornell, should have understood this principle. If it is as he said, the ancient saying "women adorn themselves for those who please them" would be a great sin. Ancient China also had the custom of dancing to seek a mate, which is the Cou You in the Zheng Feng of the Book of Songs, "Scholars hold orchids," "Only scholars and women, intimately teasing each other, presenting each other with peonies." The custom of the Yi people dancing under the moon today is probably not much different. As for keeping women at home and only allowing people to "xiangqin," marrying whoever they want, and marrying as many as they want, this is entirely a disease after the establishment of a male-centered society.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic, the relationship between dancing and marriage was not initially related to morality as Mr. Hu said. However, morality is not immutable. Biological things can be transformed into moral things by society. For the enjoyment of adults and gentlemen, it is also necessary to attack some pitiful things. In fact, dancing is probably not only a pastime for those who claim to be "怜香惜玉," but also a stubborn habit that those who "te fu wan jie" enjoy and forget. As for pleasing men in order to attach oneself to marriage, in China, it is not such a noble thing! It's pitiful to say.</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>— Chen Xueling</p>
<p>"Why is there a knot in your handkerchief?"</p>
<p>"My wife wanted me to remember to mail a letter for her."</p>
<p>"Then did you mail it?"</p>
<p>"No, she forgot to give me the letter."</p>
<h3>Contentment Brings Happiness</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>"Contentment brings happiness" is a well-known and irrefutable truth in our country throughout history. And it may be precisely our national essence and recognized wonderful philosophy of life. I remember a folk song in my hometown: "Riding a horse, full of spirit; driving a donkey, lazy and sluggish; but wait until you look back and see the pedestrians." It means to think about everything in a step-by-step manner.</p>
<p>This is really a clever saying. The donkey driver, seeing the pedestrian, of course feels arrogant and invincible, and the pedestrian, although walking with sweat, if compared with the horse carrying people, feels comforted and no longer envies the horse rider and the donkey driver. Even the horse ridden under people's crotches, thinking that its owner is more prominent and powerful than the donkey's owner, can't help but forget its hard work and feel somewhat elated, "Insufficient compared to the top, more than enough compared to the bottom." According to this logic, the donkey driver is content with driving the donkey, the pedestrian is content with walking, and the horse as livestock is content with being ridden. Thus, the horse rider can let go of the reins and add a whip without worrying about anything else.</p>
<p>The best example of contentment bringing happiness is Yan Hui, the proud disciple of Confucius, "A bamboo basket of rice, a gourd of water, living in a humble alley, others cannot bear the hardship, but Hui does not reduce his joy." Yan Hui's endurance is truly outstanding. Otherwise, how could he be content and at ease under such poor material conditions of food, clothing, and shelter? Moreover, "Yu thought that if there were drowning people in the world, it was as if he himself was drowning; Ji thought that if there were hungry people in the world, it was as if he himself was hungry." Sages have a heart to worry about the world, and they should naturally worry before the world worries and enjoy after the world enjoys. The Spring and Autumn period was better than the current world of strife, but the frequent wars among the princes were already inferior to the Great Harmony and Lesser Prosperity. Besides Yan Hui, there must have been many people who not only had a bamboo basket of rice and a gourd of water, but also many who could not even afford a bamboo basket of rice and a gourd of water. Yan Hui was able to live in a humble alley, perhaps because he also tasted the samadhi of contentment bringing happiness. Since Confucius, Yan Hui has been listed as a virtuous man, and he is respected as a virtuous man because he was able to abide by a bamboo basket of rice and a gourd of water, and regarded the rich clothes and delicacies of princes and ministers as discarded shoes, while Xiang Yu, who said "can be taken and replaced," was inevitably criticized as a man of mere bravery who was not enough to achieve great things.</p>
<p>Being slapped in the face is like accidentally tripping and falling; drinking some rice porridge for three meals is like a frozen corpse on the roadside; a small room where you can't turn around is like a beggar under a covered street; unfortunately dying is like your parents not giving birth to you. If you have this great spirit of contentment and are optimistic about everything, you will be able to ascend to eternal bliss, and your children and grandchildren will praise you as "virtuous, virtuous."</p>
<h3>After Demobilization</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>Last December, the remains of General Dai Anlan, a hero who died in the Battle of Burma, were accompanied back to his hometown for burial by Mrs. Dai, who traveled a long distance. Unexpectedly, General Dai's funeral was bleak, and Mrs. Dai even suffered from a lack of funds and drifted in a foreign land. The spirit could not be buried in peace early, and the living even suffered from lack of food! At that time, after a hundred feelings, I published a short article in Free Talk called "How to Comfort the Martyrs." Since then, although I heard that there were enthusiastic patriots who generously helped, so that General Dai could rest in peace early, I have since vowed to collect some information to see how other countries settle the soldiers who return home after demobilization and how they comfort the families of the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw several articles from extremely reliable sources, and I couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotion and shame! Chinese soldiers can certainly fight bravely against the enemy and put their lives at stake! But looking at how other people take care of their soldiers, I really feel that we have failed our anti-Japanese warriors too much. Speaking of taking care of soldiers in every possible way, we often first think of the United States. As long as American soldiers serve for sixty days, they can get $200 in severance pay upon discharge. If they have worked overseas, they can get $300. According to our official exchange rate, it would be 20 to 30 million to use, and the general prices in the United States are of course lower than in our country. But, in fact, the treatment of discharged soldiers in the United States is still far worse than that of other countries!</p>
<p>The best treatment for soldiers is probably in the Soviet Union. Soldiers receive a full year's "enxiang" for every year of service in the military. In other words, a soldier who has served for five years is given a severance fee by the government equivalent to five years of total military pay upon demobilization. But the Red Army's salary is actually very low, and the total amount of one year's enxiang is not much. However, the Soviet policy has a major feature: it can guarantee to find a job with excellent treatment for every discharged soldier within a month, and the salary of this new job is absolutely higher than the salary that the soldier earned before joining the army. The Soviet system is also particularly considerate in solving the housing problem for discharged soldiers. From the beginning of the war, the government has set aside 10% of the new houses and new apartments built across the country for the families of discharged soldiers or fallen soldiers to live in. If the soldiers originally had good families, but they were destroyed by artillery fire in the war, then the government will provide all the wood needed for free and give a loan equivalent to about $2,000, specifically for construction.</p>
<p>The UK is slightly worse than the Soviet Union. Soldiers each receive $49 in "fitting-out expenses" upon discharge, specifically for tailoring regular clothes. Any soldier who has served for three years (of which at least two years must be overseas), if he is married and has children, can additionally use a subsidy of $475; if he is a lieutenant, he can use a sum of $1,300.</p>
<p>According to US government regulations, discharged soldiers can apply to the government for long-term low-interest loans of $2,000 to $4,000 for housing education, and other expenses. But compared to New Zealand, it is inferior. Discharged soldiers in New Zealand can each receive a cash subsidy of $975, and they can also apply for a low-interest loan of up to $4,850. If the New Zealand warrior is willing to "return to the countryside" after "demobilization," then the government will give priority to land or lend him a sum of money to buy land. He can apply to the government for a loan of up to $20,200, interest-free, to be repaid within 45 years.</p>
<p>Moreover, the New Zealand government is also very considerate of the family life of discharged soldiers. If soldiers want to add a set of sofas or an electric refrigerator, and the value is less than $50, they only need to send the purchase invoice to the government, and the government will pay the bill immediately.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia and Romania also made great efforts to enable "demobilized" people to "return to the countryside." After they confiscated all the land of the Axis people and pro-Axis nationals, they divided it equally among the brave men who returned from demobilization. Often, one person can be allocated more than twenty acres. As long as they are willing to work hard, they can be worry-free for life.</p>
<h3>Making Friends</h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>Speaking of making friends, we naturally think of Mr. Dale Carnegie, the author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People." In fact, before publishing this book, Mr. Carnegie had already written a lot of books. His books on oratory, etc., were adopted as textbooks by youth association schools in New York, Brooklyn, Curayden, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other places more than thirty years ago. His writing is fluent and lively, and the serious subject matter is interspersed with lightheartedness, making it interesting to read. He himself has also served as a teacher in the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the Philadelphia Real Estate Bureau, and the New York Credit Men's Association, but he has always been unknown until he wrote "How to Win Friends—." Only then did he become famous, which shows the general importance that people attach to making friends.</p>
<p>Regarding making friends, I also remember a short article I saw in an English magazine, saying that a certain gentleman went out in the morning, and without him opening his mouth, the newspaper boy automatically handed him the newspaper; when he got on the streetcar, the driver cleared a seat for him; when he went to the tobacco shop to buy cigarettes, he didn't have to pay in cash, because these people were all his old friends. This meaning is similar to our country's common saying "Rely on your parents at home, rely on your friends when you go out," and it is even deeper. Unexpectedly, making friends can enjoy so many conveniences, and have the joy of being successful in everything, which is admirable.</p>
<p>I once told my friend Mr. Kang about this idea, but Mr. Kang didn't think so. He said that to make people work for you, you have to make friends with money. So, the beautiful dream I had after reading that article was punctured by his sharp insight.</p>
<h3>Xiaoyao Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (63)</p>
<p>Xiao Bai said, "You think it's unreasonable, but she's doing it with all her might, and both sides are preparing very well." Yu Ru said, "Can this kind of major marriage event be established without the parents' approval?" Bai said, "Young people don't do things like we do now. As long as they can achieve their goals, they will use any means." Yu Ru said, "As a parent, I can stop him." Xiao Bai shook his head and said, "This is not effective. With your power, you can call Zhu Zhai back and scold him severely, but it is impossible to stop him from getting married. He doesn't have to bother, he only needs to walk away behind your back and get married in another city. By the time the rice is cooked, what can you do? You only have one son. Can you bear to break off relations with him? At that time, you will have to reluctantly admit it." Yu Ru was speechless after hearing what Xiao Bai said. He stared with wide eyes and stamped his feet several times, muttering, "It's killing me! It's killing me!" Xiao Bai said, "Don't be angry. I have a way. You might as well try it. Maybe it will work. Gu Qiwan was originally from an official family, and her family background is very good. She usually cares most about her face. Now you only need to go to her house and talk to her, tell her about the situation in your family, and declare to her that you didn't know about Zhu Zhai's marriage to Feng Sheng. Feng Sheng is still nominally a singer. When she comes to your house in the future, she will have no status. And your family has no property, and there will be problems with her livelihood in the future. If she becomes your daughter-in-law, it will not be convenient for her to perform on stage. All these problems should be considered. Besides, Zhu Zhai is your only son, and your wife pays the most attention to etiquette, don't call Zhu Zhai to make things difficult for her. As for her affection for Zhu Zhai, you can forgive her very much. This matter was extremely supported before Fang in Zhu got married. Now that she is married, it is very difficult for the parents to deal with it. When you talk to her, as long as you are tactful and have a pleading tone, she will definitely be moved and softened. If you rely on a big principle to question her harshly, this matter will only become more and more tense, and it will be impossible to clean up in the future." Yu Ru listened, hesitated for a long time, and said, "I am so old, and it seems unworthy to beg a girl like this." Xiao Bai said, "If you want your family to be happy, this is the best way, because once a man and a woman have feelings, it is not easy to shake them no matter how much they are磨折. You must be able to grasp her weakness and take advantage of the situation to shake her will. Qiwan is very stubborn, but she is full of emotion, and this method can be used to move her." Yu Ru listened and was still hesitant. Mrs. Xu persuaded from the side, "What the second brother said is right, why don't you go and take a trip? It would be better if it succeeds, and if there is no result, think of other ways!" After Yu Ru was persuaded by his wife and Xie Bai again and again, and after a night of deliberation, he decided to go to Qiwan's house to investigate the next day! (End of this section)</p>
<h3>On Medical Ethics</h3>
<p>— Buyi</p>
<p>My child has been suffering from whooping cough for almost a month. Initially, I tried various cough medicines advertised widely in the market, but none of them worked. So, through a friend's introduction, I consulted two quite famous pediatricians, one after the other. After asking about the condition, the first doctor frowned and said, "Be careful about cold and hot food and drink. If you notice a fever in the child, come back for treatment." He didn't even write a prescription and dismissed me. As I walked out the door, I felt a bit angry. It's too easy for a doctor to earn a consultation fee like that. The second doctor was very attentive. He said that injections were necessary. When I asked how many injections were needed, he replied that at least fifteen injections were required, taking about a month and a half. I thought that my child had already been coughing for a month, and adding another month and a half of injections, whether it would actually get better was still a question. In the end, it would still last a hundred days, so why bother with so many needle pricks and medical expenses?</p>
<p>Today, I happened to meet an old classmate. I asked him if there was any special remedy for coughs. He smiled and replied, "Today, as an old classmate, I'll tell you something that ordinary doctors wouldn't tell you. Not only is there none in China, but there isn't any in any country in the world. Recently, Americans have said that all cough medicines available now are ineffective." Only then did I realize. Looking back, the first doctor I consulted was honest and likable, while the second doctor was clearly trying to drum up business and cheat me out of medical fees.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago, a friend of mine had a severe stomach ache in the summer. He went to a certain large hospital, and they diagnosed it as appendicitis and said it needed to be operated on. Because my friend thought the consultation fee at that hospital was too expensive, he went to another hospital for a second examination. It was still diagnosed as appendicitis, and the doctor gave him an hour to have the surgery. He hurriedly used that hour to arrange for the medical fees. Suddenly, he had an urgent need to defecate. After a bout of diarrhea, his abdominal pain immediately subsided. My friend has been healthy and well ever since, without ever having his appendix removed. Could it be that these two famous hospitals couldn't even diagnose appendicitis properly? I think it was more likely that they were greedy for a quick and easy business opportunity. After all, removing the appendix is relatively safe, and besides, the appendix is ultimately a superfluous appendage. However, in terms of medical ethics, taking advantage of someone in a time of crisis is a grave violation of the doctor's fundamental principles.</p>
<p>I have heard of and encountered many doctors who truly possess a spirit of kindness and sacrifice, which is admirable and deeply appreciated. However, there are also many who, knowing they cannot cure, recklessly prescribe medicine or take advantage of people's distress, like "creating sores on healthy flesh." I hope they can put themselves in the patients' shoes and reflect on how painful it would be if they were the patients themselves, or the family members of the patients!</p>
<h3>Ling Xiaohan Pavilion in Memory</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>Among the reporters who were quite prominent in the early years of the Republic—forgive me for using this Shanghai slang—those who were promoted have risen to become elders or important figures, those who have died are dead, those who have fallen have fallen. Many have become honored elders or even great-grandfathers. Today, those who are still writing articles can probably be counted on one hand. As far as I know, the only one who is still vigorously wielding his pen is Ling Xiaohan Pavilion—Mr. Xu Lingxiao.</p>
<p>The Xu Lingxiao that people know today is mostly the Ling Xiaohan Pavilion who is a master of historical anecdotes. In fact, in terms of historical anecdotes, Mr. Lingxiao's younger brother, Mr. Yishi, is even more specialized. The Xu Lingxiao that I know is a multifaceted talent, namely:</p>
<p>Engineer—He graduated from Beiyang University with a degree in engineering, but he never seemed to pursue his original profession throughout his life, so many people are unaware of his background.</p>
<p>Communication Expert—In the early years of the Republic, Mr. Xu was a master at writing Beijing dispatches. His characteristics were: Interweaving narration and commentary; objective descriptions and subjective criticisms. Comprehensive Reporting: Stringing together many unrelated events like beads on a string, making them an organic piece of news. Witty Style: Using a subtle and insightful tone, creating light and flavorful metaphors. Proficient in Historical Anecdotes: Especially familiar with the background and personality of every important figure in the government, able to grasp their position and background and make inferences. Insider News: Revealing some insider information from the dispatches that people would rather keep secret, inferring three corners from one. Reflecting the Atmosphere: Such as noting where the carriage stopped in which alley, the expressions of the dignitaries sitting in the pond pavilion watching the opera, subtly measuring the political atmosphere from the side, without avoiding trivial details. Literary Temperament: The "reportage literature" that is popular today blends literature and journalism into one. Mr. Xu had already demonstrated this in his dispatches, so he can be said to have been a visionary.</p>
<p>Journalism Scholar—Chinese universities had journalism departments starting with Shao Piaoping's creation of the Civilian University's Journalism Department, and Mr. Xu was the main professor of the Civilian University's Journalism Department. The range of courses he taught was very broad, from literature to advertising, but it is a pity that he did not teach his housekeeping skills in printing (engineering). (Famous journalists of today, such as Zhang Youluan and Huang Tianpeng, were his students at the time.)</p>
<p>Drama Scholar—Mr. Lingxiao is a theater enthusiast. Almost every article he writes uses theater as a metaphor. When he talks about opera—of course, Peking opera—he not only talks about singing and acting, but also analyzes the plot and script, using a lively method to evaluate the opera, slightly incorporating Western drama theory. At a time when the new youth completely negated old opera and overcorrected, Mr. Lingxiao made the unique contribution of preserving the value of Chinese opera from the side.</p>
<p>Supplement Expert—In Beijing in the teens of the Republic of China, Sun Fuyuan's Chenbao and Jingbao supplements were overwhelming, but Mr. Lingxiao was able to compile another supplement for the Jingbao, standing alongside Mr. Fu Guo in the Jingbao with high-level taste, and also having a large number of readers.</p>
<p>The above is just a glimpse, and it is already so profound.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Lingxiao and I had the pleasure of being colleagues, we were not familiar with each other. What I know is that he is from Yixing, Jiangsu, but grew up in the north, and cannot speak a single word of Jiangnan dialect. When I was teaching at a private university, I passed by the classroom where he was teaching. Nearly twenty years later, I still remember the impression I had at the time: he spoke Beijing dialect with a slight Hebei accent, his voice was not loud, clear and pure, and his appearance was lean and cold. He was wearing an old overcoat, took out a crumpled roll of lecture notes from his pocket, and was not the Ling Xiaohan Pavilion who spoke with a crisp and clear Beijing accent as I had imagined.</p>
<p>Mr. Lingxiao is still as sharp as ever, which is gratifying. Although his writing style is gradually becoming more rugged, he is, after all, "an old general or a Sichuan horse, one is worth two." I wish him "good health" here!</p>
