<h3>杜魯門向國會聲明　卽提特別援華計劃　兪大維貝祖詒展期赴美</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統七日親自向參·衆雨院聯席會議發表長五千字之咨文，允諾於不久的將來給予中國以援助。杜魯門之咨文，以對內政策及歐洲復興計劃爲主，除述及中國外，並未提及任何其他外國之名。杜魯門於允諾將使中國包括在美國之協助世界復興以完成和平之廣泛計劃內時，曾明示渠不久即將向國會提出關於中國之特別計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕赴美大員兪大維，貝祖　爾氏行期業已決定暫緩，貝原定七日返滬，現因事中止，據聞或係因資料之準備不及所延誤。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕外部代理情報司長時昭　七日答覆記者詢問稱：交長兪大維及前巾央銀行總裁貝祖飴兩氏訪美事，原爲中國政府建議，而爲美國務院所同意者，兩氏赴美日期，現尙未決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕中國民主社會黨主席張君勸今日在此問向聯合社記者談稱：中國政府將於一星期內向美國提出美國進一步援華具體方案，其內容當以中國當前局勢及自動能力吿知美國，並就美國所能繼續資助中國需要之處，提出建議。交通部長兪大維，似將領導中國代表國前來接洽，當美國務卿馬歇爾在華時，兪氏嘗與之合作，該團何時啓程，不得而知。中國所凝向美提出之復興計劃，乃蔣主席若千時前任命五人委員會審査之結果。張氏對於中國代表向美政府將有何種陳述，不欲掃測，僅稱財政改革與貨幣安定實爲中國根本問題，估計四億美元即足以穩定中國幣制。張氏談及馬歇爾援歐計劃稱：大約十五億或二十億美元，可以應付中國一切需要，張氏現正首途赴西雅岡，向華盛頓大學講述中國新憲法兩個月。</p>
<h3>美政府對外援助　應包括遠東各國　若干議員考慮廣大方案</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日合衆電〕國會本屆會議第一日，已有强烈之跡象，顯示若干議員業已考慮將馬歇爾歡洲復原計劃擴爲包羅更廣之方案，遠東亦列入其中，此由於目前政府之計劃並不）致，蓋政府官員曾宣稱：渠等在短期之內，除特殊之援華計劃外，願集中努力於歐洲，共和黨麻省衆議負赫特在會中頗具勢力，渠直率表示將反對政府提出之馬歇爾計劃，其原因端在該計劃至時機成熟時，仍不能使日本·中國及遠東其他地區列入政府對外之援助。赫氏並未作確切之預測，但稱，渠相信在一般性計劃之下，對日本之援助，可於和約簽訂以及軍事佔領結束後立即予以實施，對華援助亦將在一般計劃之下執行，而非一個別之計劃，赫氏曾於去年六月率領國會特別委會赴歐洲調査救濟之需要，頃提出法案，主張全球性之援助，應置於兩黨機構下執行之，而非除馬歇爾計劃所謂由國務卿負責推進者，赫氏主張國務卿僅能指揮救濟計劃中之外交政策部份，但無實際執行之　，關於分配之管制，渠主張集中於新機構之下，而不由農業及商務兩部管理。渠指出全球救濟計劃之分數及分配情形稱：「去年吾人對參與巴黎會議十六國家之輸出額，僅佔出口總額三分之一，其餘均輸往遠東，南美及其他區域，對於此點殊少有人瞭解」。</p>
<h3>周以德廣播　援華爭取自由</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約七日電〕共和黨議員周以德今夜在空中講座發表廣播演說稱；美國防止第三次世界大戰之　佳機會，厥在盡其所能，確保蘇聯無法控制中國。美國現若不克援助中國，則其在太平　戰爭犧牲之人力與金錢均將擲諸　化。與其坐令蘇聯控制中國，母寗　昔聽任日本接收中國爲愈。中國需要經濟改革，但此事蔣主席知之甚稔，美國如果希望中國政府改善，則應支持該國政府竭力爭取自由。周氏並稱，美國援華愈少，則中國遭遇愈慘，遭遇愈慘，則援助更少，此種惡性循環必須打破。同時，前駐蘇大使　立特今日亦參加廣播節目，對於周氏主張表示擁護，但遠東問題專家即霍着斯金大學國際學院院長賴迪謨與前生活雜誌駐華記者勞特巴哈則所見逈異，據拉氏聲稱：美國人士規在中國較諸蘇聯人士不得民心，目前中國民衆愛國之心甚爲熱烈，且反對干涉中國內政最多之國家，不幸現有駐華美軍顧間千名，而用以轟炸中國鄕村之全部飛機均係美國製造，中共並未接受蘇聯供給兵器，日益明顯，有資格美國記者經年注意蘇聯援助巾共之確證，迄無所獲。</p>
<h3>我增加進口稅　美商尙無反響　某出口商表示同情</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約六日電〕美方與我國經營貿易之出口商，對我國增加進口稅百分之五十，迄今尙無反響。渠等或則不知新辦法，或則靜待詳細之報導。據紐約出口商俱樂部發言人稱，美國出口商中僅有少數運貨赴華進行貿易，故「大部份出口商尙未考處此一問題。」渠稱：「任何增稅措施，自圖限制對華之出口。」據美全國對外貿易委負會發言人稱，自短期貿易而言，百分之五十附加稅，對美國對華出口影饗甚微，因中國目前對美貨要求迫切，當不致受高稅率之阻礙，但就長期而言，自屬不利之舉，因此種辦法，在限制美國對華之出口。某主要出口商對我政府提高關稅以求獲得急需要之國家收入，表示同情，唯對關稅增加後其事業所受影響如何，拒加判斷。</p>
<h3>莫斯科各報刊載　毛澤東反美言論</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科六日電〕今此問各報將共首毛澤東各年所有在中共中央委會所發表之演辭全文予以刋載，該項演說攻擊國民黨與美國「帝國主義」，幷號召亞一洲各民族實行「反帝鬥爭」。</p>
<h3>外部情報司長　派時昭瀛接充</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕外交部息：外部參事兼代情報司司長張沅長，最近由美返部，因原掌職務繁忙，不克兼顯情報司工作，請辭兼職，業經照准，所遣該司司長一缺，現已改派時昭　接充。按時氏在張參事因任務赴美期間，即已被派代理該司司務。又情報司帮辦一職亦於去歲十二月四日派專門委員屬　稽辦理。</p>
<h3>對日貿易會通過簽證記賑法內容</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕對日貿易指導委會，七日續舉行會議，當通過簽證記賬辦法，其條文待整理後即可送政院備案。另根據上述辦法，通過商人對日貿易記賬辦法及漁業界請派代表赴日參加商務代表團事，已決准推派代表一人。茲誌簽證記帳辦法內容如次：甲，根據盟總核准貨約，再經政府核准，交由駐日代表團商務專負證明後，持證明書向轍出入管委會請發出入口許可證。乙，商務專員簽證時，必須根據中信局之記賬。丙，記賬時，務求平衡，每一代表單獨記賬與政府所辦易貨賬目分開。</p>
<h3>日軍械落入中共手　美要求蘇方說明　盟國管制會中引起激辯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京七日電〕盟國管制日本委員會七日晨舉行會議前，議程上本無「正式」事項，然在會議過程中，美·蘇代表突然發生激辮，主席美代表施巴德吿蘇聯代理代表吉斯倫柯少將稱，近來報載，日本關東軍所有之武器，一九四五年已由蘇聯接收，然業已落入中共軍隊之手，故美國要朮蘇聯供給關係此事之消息，吉斯倫柯以委員會無權作此項詢問爲理由，拒絕發表任何消息。</p>
<p>會議伊始，蘇代表首先發難，提出關係日本軍械之問題，渠指責施氏企圖削弱委員會，蘇聯於十二月三十一日提出要求委員會討論及聽取有關日本解除武器之消息，然施氏竟拒將該項列入議程。（下接二版一　）</p>
<h3>九龍城房屋被拆除　居民多露宿廢墟　我抗議文英使轉交港府</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕英駐華大使館班以安七日官稱：中國外交部關於九龍事件之抗議案，該館業已收到，並即轉達香港政府知照矣。此外，該館人士不願發表任何意見，惟據記者所悉，英方對於九龍事件之看法，認係地方事件，乃港府爲地方衢生建設行使其土地之使用權發生者。我政府則以爲無論該地區主權或使用權最後當如何解決，港方强制措施乃欠友好者，我方抗議目的，首在使港方注重中英友好傳統，再循外交途徑，謀求爭執之根本解決。九龍事件之後果，非僅地方事件而已，實已涉及　英間之友誼問題，今後發展，將視港方對此事，如何出以理智之考慮。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州七日電〕港政府强迫拆遷我九龍城民房事，此問各界異常憤慨，各報同時著論，指責港政府此舉爲有意侵害我領土主權，造成不尋常事件。穗粤各民衆團體日內將會商對被拆遷之同胞作有效之援助，省參會亦準備聯合民衆團體代表組織訪問團，赴九龍城慰問被害同胞，並詳細調査狀况，俾作有效對付。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港七日電〕往日熙熈攘攘之九龍舊城，刻已化爲聯樣破板堆積所，昔日該處之居民，其中一部已設共在香港親友處覓得棲身之地，其最困苦之一部，約仍有三百男女老幼，則尙徘徊露宿於廢墟之上。實安縣畏王啓厚昨抵九龍調査慰問，渠並以法幣五百萬元作爲賓安縣救濟此受難同胞之第一批款項，香港政府發言人今晨讀：彼等尙未接獲英駐華大使關於我國抗議此事之通知。被捕之兩同胞，被警局拘押迄今已達三天，彼等係被　從事煽動騷亂，並阻止警察執行職務者。</p>
<h3>獨立日飄揚之國旗　葉外次等今日離緬返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：仰光訊，中國葉外次稱，中國對獨立之緬甸，具有最友好之善鄰精神，外傳中國對緬甸有侵略野心實屬荒謬，中緬邊境糾紛，必須由兩國組織聯合委員會予以公正之解決。</p>
<p>〔中央社仰光七日電〕昨晚八時在內定緬甸駐華大使宇密登寓，有一足以證明中緬友好關係之東大事件，即緬外長宇丁圖以緬甸獨立紀念日一月四日晨四時廿分降下英國旗後，曾經飄揚而具有歷史意義之緬甸國旗，贈與中國萊特使，月擊此隆重之典禮者，有中國特別代表國，盎山夫人及宇密室少數好友，贈旗前，宇丁圖曾發表如下之簡短致辭：「特使閣下，余謹以此根據標準尺寸製成，幷曾在獨立紀念日飄揚於升旗台上之緬甸國旗，作爲中緬邦交之象徵，贈與閣下，余　對貴國派遣如閣下之傑出人物來徵國參加獨立紀念典禮，表示謝忱。」葉特使受旗後，致答詞如下：「余對閣下此優美禮物，至感忭謝，其所具有之充分意義，爲余所深深禮會，而余即以此種心情欣然接受，余願向閣下保證，此旗飄揚於中國之日，將受中國人民最高之崇敬。」按緬甸國旗在色彩與設計方面，頗與我國國旗相似，但於靑天白日紅地之外，加以五星而已，此五星代表構成緬甸聯邦之緬甸族，喀欽族，卡倫族，撣族，嶔族五族，此具有歷史意義之緬甸國旗，將由我國特使團一行八日離緬之日，携同返國。</p>

<h3>九龍城事件平議</h3>
<p>香港政府強迫九龍城二千居民遷出事件，日來事態忽趨嚴重。本案之發生，先是港政府公用事業部於去年十一月廿七日，通吿九龍城二千居民「勒令遷移」，並以十二月十一日爲限期。九龍城居民以該地區爲中國所有，行政權迄今仍屬中國政府，乃組織居民協會，向地方政府及外交特派員請願，並公開宣稱：即使冒流血之危險，亦所不惜。外部駐兩廣特派員郭德華，除喚起港政府注意外，曾一度到京請示，期以外交　徑解決本案。十二月十一日，九龍城倖吿無事，但九龍新界栽判司則以傳票拘訊九龍城居民協會代表；各代表臨難不變，拒絕港方非法傳訊，結果捕去代表二名，本月五日香港政府更擴大事態，動員警察別動隊二百五十人，入九龍城執行拆屋工作，陷大部居民露宿於廢墟中，無家可歸。看港警的能勢，第一步行動是拆毁九龍城民房，第二步行動即驅逐無家可歸之華人離境，最後建立警察權，完成其佔領。我國外交部對港政府此種强制行動，已提出抗議，我們對這事件，倍感關切，希望政府向英據理力爭，並有效阻止香港警察侵犯中國主權的無理行動。</p>
<p>九龍城位於九龍半島之東北角，遜淸時代名「九龍寨」，築有城坦，保衛海疆。淸道光廿二年（公元一八四二年）雅片之役，被迫訂立江寗條約，割讓香港於英；一八六〇年英續租九龍（稱九龍新界），爲香港之屛障。惟九龍城舊址及龍津大道，仍屬中國領土，　粵省賽安縣治。一八九八年六月九日，中英訂立「展拓香港英新租界租約」，規定香港與九龍城界域有云：「所有九龍城內駐紮之中國官員，仍可在城內各司其事，仍留附近九龍城原有舊碼頭一區，以使中國官商各船渡船任使往來停泊，且便城內官吏任使行走」。又議定：「在所展界內，不可將居民迫令遷移，產業入官」。很明白的，九龍城是屬於中國生權的領土，中國官員不特在界址以內可以行使其職權，則中國人民在區城內亦有居住的自由，並不許可受任何干擾。積弱的淸廷，割讓了香港和九龍半島，僅留下九龍城最爾之地，致富甲全國的廣東省，抱殘守缺到如今。我國人民隨時期待香港問題能有合理的解決，而於抗戰勝利以後爲尤甚，不期戰後的香港問題尙懸而未決，而香港政府竟反變本加厲，自毀前議，進迫九龍城居民遷移，意圖强佔中國疆土，擴大英領香港勢力範圍。我們爲維護國家領土主權計，爲保障二千居民生命財產計，除同情九龍城居民的據理抗爭外，幷希望外交當局於照例的抗議之後，續作有力的交涉。</p>
<p>十八世紀的英國殖民地政策，本有擴大香港範圍，發展遠東經濟勢力的企圖。一八四二年八月割取香港；一八六〇年十月進謀九龍半島；一八九八年六月勘界，展拓了香港範圍。但香港政府並不放棄對九龍城的奪取，民廿二年，廿五年，廿八年，及戰後二十六年九月，曾四度强迫九　城居民遷移，現在是第五次行動了。廿五年的糾紛，事態相當嚴重，九　城內房屋拆毁　盡，當時由於居民堅決的抗爭，全國輿論羣起聲援，更由於五省外交官據理力爭，不屈不　，始爲中國保全了這塊土　。尤其是當年　介候氏應變的態度，勇毅的精神，絕不退讓領土的一寸一步，使港政府不得不於正義之下退卻，　在還有民十六年革命外交的遺風。所以說，爲了保護這　爾之地，我們有過光榮的史續，在外交上行政上曾表現了堅定的奮鬥。這次的糾紛，嚴重於往昔各次的事態，我們要看看外交當局，是否爲了過去的光榮，繼續採取積極的合理態度與步驟，以保全九龍城的主權。</p>
<p>因此，我們呼籲政府當局，在外交部抗議之後，應當機立斷，配合行政上的有效行動，制止香港警察侵入九龍城，並要求香港當局釋放被捕居民代表，賠償九龍城居民在生命財產上蒙受的損失。如果我們在外交上行政上，不能把　時機，爲適宜的措施，致喪失了九龍城的主權，這對於國家信譽上的影響</p>
<p>最後，我們希望英政府和香港當局，認識中英問的遠大關係，勿作刺激中國人民感情的行動。九龍城問題，並無所謂條約解釋之爭。我們即欣然看見英國的退出印度，又看見緬甸的獨立，甚頗英國當局對於九龍這一問題，也能抱著開明的態度度加以處理。嚴格言之，九龍城本身爲查港政府權力所不能到達之地，即使爲了　治安關係，也應首先安定民心，斷不能到拆屋迫遷情事的發生。我們珍重中英間的睦　，願香港當局能够迅速回復理智，制止這種行動！</p>

<h3>日軍械問題</h3>
<p>〔上接一版〕吉民稱：美代表企圖掩蔽眞相，並阻制委員會之討論。商討及管制日本，施巴德否認掩蔽眞相，並稱：蘇聯現在所要求之情報，其實早己獲得，蘇代表稱：渠要求聽取一九四七年底爲止關係日本解除武裝，機塲·兵工廠·海岸防禦及其他有關資料之情報。渠稱：渠提出將該項列入七日議程之時，施氏即邀其談話，吿以該項不擬列入議程。吉氏稱：美代表理由不充份，渠希望抗議此項「獨斷」行爲，並否認施氏所稱蘇聯要求有遠本曾參考章程，施巴德乃透露，蘇聯之要求包括解除日本武裝十項獨立問題，然渠未說明詳情，施氏復堅稱，在日本及在華府遠東委員會中蘇代表均已知悉彼等現在所要求之全部情報。</p>
<p>在蘇聯提出日本重械問題後，施巴德乃告吉氏稱：蘇聯於一九四六年九月十八日接獲要求，令其提供日本在東北軍備之情報，蘇聯當時答稱，全部消息，未彙集前，無法加以報告。雖蘇聯於一九四五年日本投降後不久曾發表報吿，然施巴德稱此報告性質爲專供報館應用之表面文章。施氏又稱：近時報章指出，日本關東軍之軍械已入中共之手，美國希望獲知此種局面之眞相，渠稱：日本軍備處之詳明報吿，有助於委帥之起草最後處理日本軍事組織之報吿。吉斯綸柯宣稱：關係東北之消息，對日本情形絕不相關，施氏反　　稱：「然則是否貴代表否認關東軍係日本軍隊之一部份」！蘇代表乃　責施巴德要求不在委員會職權區域內之消息，渠稱施氏關係中共之言論，旨在移轉視聽，掩蔽其本人不將蘇聯所提項目列入議程之「過失」。渠稱：如美國不在掩蔽眞相，則所要求之情報應早已公布，此問題之所以不討論實無遁辭，吉氏率直堅持將其要求列入下次會議議程，然施巴德亦堅不讓步，渠稱一年前曾有一類似之報吿供給蘇聯。此外，遠東委員會所獲情報極爲詳盡，施氏繼乃指斥蘇聯濫用委員會，渠稱；制止此項濫用，此其時矣。「本人力圖使本會成建設性機構，然顯一然已吿失敗」。</p>
<p>蘇代表乃轉而詢問中英代表之意見，中國代表商震將軍稱，目前無批評，蘇聯項目是否應列入議程，由主席施巴德決定爲是，英代表蕭氏則稱，渠經常能獲得所需之悄報，其意似在支持美國立塲，然渠又稱：凡省將「適當問題」列入議程，不應加以限制</p>

<h3>剿匪勝利隨新年俱來　鄧文儀報吿一週戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕國防部新聞局局長鄧文儀，七日下午在記者招待會席上報吿三十六年十二月三十一日至三十七年元月六日之一週戰局稱：剿匪軍事，已隨者三十七年的新年而獲致了新的勝利；目前各綫　報頻傳，正象徵着這勝利的開始。茲分述本週內各錢戰况於次：</p>
<p>東北戰塲　匪軍上週曾一度接近潘郊，國軍反擊　殲，十二月二十九日至一月二日的四天之中，國軍在遼北萬金台，盤古台等地給來犯之匪第一·三·六·十·各縱隊以致命打擊，匪受重創，紛向法庫東南及法庫西北，一帶地區抱頭鼠　，在遼西方而國攻新立屯的匪八九兩個縱隊，經國軍予以反包圍後，傷亡萬餘，於一月三日，一部向北鎭黑山方向轉進，刻國軍正對該匪加以打擊，遼南方面之匪第四縱隊，正被國軍包圍攻擊。同時，我空軍在東北於一月五日獲得輝煌戰果，計在長春附近　師五百餘人，又在法庫西南炸毀匪軍運輸部隊及　重車輪甚多，使　受到很重的損失。</p>
<p>冀察方面　　榮　匪部妄想破壞平保平綏兩路，威脅保垣，週來經國軍分路進剿，始則於一月三日在察南延慶附近殲匪一萬餘人，其在平綏路北竄擾之獨立旅，僅剩一千人，北向奔逃，造成新年苜次大勝。繼而一月四日在定縣平岡附近，又殲滅了第四縱隊一個旅，其第三縱隊刻又遭我包圍，華北方面國軍已獲優異之戰果。</p>
<p>大別山區　劉匪爲躱避國軍圍剿計，化整爲零，分途流竄於　山峻嶺間，其第一縱隊　徊於汝南南北地區，劉匪之二·三兩個縱隊，化爲數小股琉竄於舒城　山以南，桐城潛山太湖以北地區，第六縱隊則散竄於經扶以東及上巴河，桐梓河，一帶地區，至逃向新野之第十縱隊大洪山之匪十二縱隊殘部，國軍正會合民團分路搜剿中。另劉匪江漢獨立旅羅厚福部主力，仍　國軍制　於監利以北之新溝咀，徘徊無定，漏網逃至武穴之一股三百餘人，五日經地方團隊擊潰，武穴已復原狀。</p>
<p>魯豫邊區　之陳毅匪部八·十一·兩縱隊，圍攻菏澤，損失慘重，現一部已北竄，其一·三·四·六·各縱隊，自參加　攻確山郾城後，傷亡甚大，除六縱隊仍在　城外圍外，一·三·四·各縱隊均流竄於商水項城汝南間地區，國軍正由柬南北三面分途圍殲。</p>
<p>陳　匪部之四·九·兩縱隊，自圍攻確山不逞後，復遭國軍反擊，十二月卅一日確山解圍，九縱隊　踞舞陽保安　一帶，四縱隊竄至　城附近，旋經國軍分途進擊，該兩縱隊於一月五日仍回竄泌陽附近地區，現該方無大戰鬥。</p>
<p>綜觀本週各戰塲匪情，已證實匪軍幷無一正確之作戰目標，僅存倖勝之心理，其化整爲零分股流　，到處打家刦舍危害民衆，無非企求苟延生存，此種暴戾匪軍，長此流竄鬥爭，必然普遍引起人民仇恨，幷將　短其滅亡之里程。我們在此可作一結論，即共匪去年之發展，已到頂點，　光反照，已　除夕而消逝，國軍剿匪，今後也許要更艱古，但連續之勝利，將與新年而俱來。</p>

<h3>國產影片氣象蓬勃　各廠爭逐明星百計羅致人才　今年籌創新廠仍多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年度本市影片業蓬勃異常，除國營之「中製」外，民營之「中電」，「崑崙」，「文華」，「國泰」，「上實」均紛紛在滬設廠。惟因膠片進口未能取得官價結匯，多鎮柯達公司零星供給，故出品總量不及戰前五分之一，但亦因此使製作態度較爲嚴謹，題材幾全部取之民間，充分反映現實，爲去年整個電影藝術最珍貴之收獲。其中如崑崙之「一江春水向東流」，去年在各處迎售八百餘場滿座，突破戰前「漁光曲」八十四日及「姊妹花」六十日之售座紀錄。其次「中製」之「中國之抗戰」記錄片，亦備受各地民衆熱烈歡迎。各廠商因物力限制，加之一切設備简陋，製片技術尙難與西片抗衡，因此南洋方面之市塲迄未能圓滿拓展。演員方面新人頗少登庸，稍負時譽之「明星」遂爲各廠爭逐之對象，甚且有以巨額「挖費」百計羅致者。淮今年起仍有人紛紛籌創新廠，需要人才益亟，預料訓練新進演員將爲今年影片業當務之急。</p>

<h3>兩條陣線　浙西昌化　選塲側影</h3>
<p>〔本報昌化大日訊〕選舉第一課，在浙西的昌化，四萬五千個選民對它　惑到特有的興趣，原因並不在全體選民都能瞭解自己這一份選舉權利，而是候選人的熱烈竸爭與角逐所促使，數月來的時日，每個鄕村角落都罩滿了濃厚的選舉空氣，「王學權怎樣怎樣，陳詒怎樣怎樣……」當作茶餘飯後的談話資料。</p>
<p>宣傳標語五顏六色</p>
<p>五顏六色的宣傳標語，爲選舉而聯名擁議某某，某某某的小型鉛印品，以及什麽「選舉通訊」，「民主」……之類的臨時油印刋物，內容大都不外關於選舉的意見，但也有因爲立塲的不同，相互攻擊，相互謾駡，你來貼，我來撕，你來撕，我再貼，十足表現了「大無畏的精神」與「百折不撓的殺力」。</p>
<p>選舉權證延緩分發</p>
<p>依照選舉罷免法規定，選舉權證須於選舉前二十天發給選民，可是在昌化是未便照辦，一直到臨選前三天才由選舉事務所發出，較偏遠的選民，到開始選舉的時候還未領到選舉權證。有人說，這次國大代表的選舉已經延期了一個月，否則勢將鬧成更多的笑話—</p>
<p>許多選證未蓋縣印</p>
<p>不知是否辦理選舉人員的疏忽抑還是其他原因，發給選民有很多未蓋縣印的選舉權證，也有很多與選舉人名册不同號碼的選舉權說，更有同名同號一人發給兩張以上的選舉權證。前二者是選舉權彼取消了，而後者却多了一份選舉權。</p>
<p>動聽頭銜事前不知</p>
<p>在有些選舉權證上面，加蓋着「參加婦女選舉」，「參加農會選舉」……等字樣的木戳，誰是婦女會會員，誰是農會會員，事前運他們自己都沒有知道有這樣一種美麗動聽的銜頭，然而他們却都不識抬舉，紛紛指責婦女會與社會科的擅自造列會員名册等等，因爲他（她）們都認爲這也等於「强姦民意」。而事情偏又凑巧得很，這許多所謂會員，大都是有利於候選人王學權的選民。</p>
<p>王陳二人積極活動</p>
<p>候選人一共有七位，但是除了王學權與陳詒二位外，其餘的並不怎樣積極活動，所以選舉塲所內的聲勢始終是關於王·陳二位。</p>
<p>十九票匭管理神秘</p>
<p>全縣十九個票匭，每個票匭的管理及監察人員共七人，除調用黨部縣府及鄕鎭人員外，其中很多是浙江省田糧處的職員，（按候選人陳飴先生現任該處處長）眞正地方公正的士紳都沒有資格被聘用，這種神秘的人事佈置，大家始終對選學事務所懐着一個不解的謎。</p>
<p>慷慨善舉三萬一票</p>
<p>爭取選民來選一票，似乎很不容易，於是各鄕傳出了這樣的消息：「三萬元一票，二萬元一票，代書人每票抽二千……」在農村經濟極度枯竭的今天，有人慷慨解囊，利及大衆，善舉！善舉！</p>
<p>不投我票請你當兵</p>
<p>「不投某人的票，呌你去當兵。不投某人的票，要你……」這對於可欺的善良民衆的利害關係是太大了，然而民意被閹割了。</p>
<p>爲了胞兄給你磨墨</p>
<p>在選舉塲所規定任何人不能在寫票的地方監視，可是也有例外的，昱關鄕鄕長陳諒，是候選人陳貽先生的胞兄，他在該鄕第十二投票所担任監票員，不憚煩勞，在寫票的地方給你　墨，拿筆……等你將「陳詒」二字盡寫無誤後，方始放心了。誰能說他不守塲規，誰又能說他沒有服務的精神？</p>
<p>票匭搬塲提前封存</p>
<p>在選舉三天內規定票匭不得自行移動，可是有些票匭是奇蹟一般地從甲村搬到乙村了。選舉終止，原是定了期的，但也有些票匭不到時間就封存了的，於是很多選民無可奈何地放棄了選</p>
<p>熱血同鄕憤恨咆哮</p>
<p>沿京滬杭一帶的昌化大中學生，以及服務各機關團體的昌化同鄕，爲了關懐故鄕的選舉，這次都結隊回去作義務宣傳，他們都是滿懐正義感的熱血靑年，他們要求吳縣長堅定公正立塲，主持正義，更要求在鄉各領導人士共同建立穩固的民主基礎，養成良好的選舉風氣，可是現實使他們太失望了，於是他們憤恨，咆哮！然而憤恨由你憤恨，咆哮儘管咆哮，當道者懐着「笑駡由人笑駡，好事我自爲之」的態度，沒有理會你們的憤恨，也沒有聽見你們的咆哮！</p>
<p>兩條陣綫一個結論</p>
<p>由於這次王·陳的熱烈競爭，目前的昌化顯然形成了兩條陣錢，在沒有揭曉誰當選以前，一般人就有了這樣的批評：「一條是雖敗猶榮，一條是雖成猶敗」。（特約記者方正）</p>

<h3>李惠堂轟動昆明（續完）　暢談參加世運足球預選</h3>
<p>談參加世運</p>
<p>李惠堂在昆，賽球和應酬十分忙碌，記者找了個機會，和他作了一次長談。他說：「對於明年世運會的參加，中國恐怕仍是以「觀光」的姿態前往，不是洩氣，事實的確如此！」跟　他便專談到中國足球界的情形，不可諱言的，中國的體育人材眞正太少，杭戰八年，大受影響。</p>
<p>球王談起了上次參加世運，和英倫足球隊迎戰等情形，以及轉戰九個國家的經過，眞是不勝滄桑之感。眼見明年世界運動會又要舉行了，足球領隊由容啓兆博士担任，另由　惠堂，余衡之，周家騏，黃家駿等五人担任足球選手選拔委員，這一工作，預定在三十七年二月完成，以後還得在香港集中訓練，最遲想在四月中旬由本國出發，這次擬改變路綫，不經南洋羣島，而經菲律賓，紐西蘭，南美洲諸地，因爲可以藉此機會，練習觀摩，以資借鏡，沿途賽球門票所得，補</p>
<h3>代表的選拔</h3>
<p>選拔選手問題，李氏個人意見，認爲上海隊最多有五人入選，馬來亞隊入選者可能有四人，選手大部仍將一洛在香港，足球代表隊可能選出十八人至二十人，這次選拔的標準當比較嚴格，而且願意多選出些年靑的「新人」，不願讓「老牌選手」來包辦這一個球隊，沮個意見是非常寳貴的</p>
<p>末了，他談及中國足球代表隊這次出國，最好能有一架專機，爲經濟時間，謂攝球員體力，不打算再由海道迂迥了，目前正在和中國航空公同交涉，問題不多，公司方面也表示樂於幫忙。其次便是隊員的糧食問題，不能不事先計劃，因爲英國的「配給制」是雷厲風行的，每星期一個人只有一枚鷄蛋，一夸特牛油，假使這探，球王笑着說：「那麽中國球員，會要不能上陣的了」。因此在可能範圍內，打算多運點白米，多貯藏些菜蔬，以免臨時抓不着東西吃。</p>
<p>他看這次世界運動會國中，得分的可能是極少的，足球只要能保持過去的榮譽，便已如願，其他照目前的成績，縷文敖的萬米賽，可以排名第五，假使世界的成績，沒有新變動的話。</p>
<p>談的太多了，記者在他緊握的手堂中，興辭了出來。（本報駐　特派員徐繼濂）</p>

<h3>棉花商業公會招待各界　陳述棉商八大願望　花紗布各關係方面將開聯席會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市棉花商業同業公會爲行政院於上年十二月廿三日會議通過之「全國花紗布管理辦法」一事，特於昨日下午二時，假招商局六樓，招待各界。到潘公慶·楊管北·嚴諤聲·潘士浩·馬君碩·王啓宇·石鳳翔·劉丕基·及該業公會理監事會員等約近百人，會塲情緒殊爲激昂。最後花紗布各關係方面首腦，咸主定期召開聯席談話會，俾就合法步驟，爭取同業生存之範圍內，共同擬　妥善意見，貢獻政府各關係當局，採納施行，大會延至六時許始散。茲探誌會議經過大要如次：</p>
<p>正當棉商不能失業存棉應予合理收購</p>
<p>首由該業公會理事長劉　蓀，常務理事鄭哲丞分別致詞，就統購原棉後，陳述棉商之願望八點如次：　依憲法第十五條解釋，花紗布管理辦法顯已限制花商之工作權。又按憲法第一七二條規定：「命令與憲法抵觸者無效」，統購命令之施行，殊值得注意。　棉花商係運銷商，且就花紗布管理辦法第二節第三款而論，「產棉地區棉商所收之棉花，應按本會規定價格，全部售予本會統收棉花機構」，是已認定棉商有在產區收花之權，實不容以談話變更命令。且現時旣有搶購必要，除委託紡建公司外，何不同時容納棉商一起來搶。　棉商歷史悠久，行莊分設全國各棉產區，專司原料採運工作。　棉商在戰時及復員以後，對國家不無貢獻，自身損失浩繁，有要求國家保障生存之權。　紡建公司各地收花分莊，大多設於都市較大之集散市塲，其棉花來源均係棉商供給。棉商專業經營，自負全責，實較委託代購爲佳。　自當局決定統購原棉後，棉商存棉，即未能出售，虧損尤鉅。　棉商目前業務全停，成本耗盡，過遲已有無從挽救之處。　棉商請求三點：（甲）「正當棉商，不能使之失業」。（乙）棉商存棉，應即撥款以合理價格收購。（丙）未經紗管會指定代紡之紗廠所需棉花，由棉商任採運之勞。</p>
<p>潘議長支持兩原則保障職業協助生產</p>
<p>市參議會潘議長致詞略稱：傳聞紗管會暫時將委託紡建公司代爲購棉，但願此係傳聞，果屬事實，則本人就目前剿匪戡亂經濟戡亂之立塲而言，當予反對。共匪到處作亂破壞，政府則旨在積極建設生產。在此局面下，祗需棉商能按規定，將所收之花，按規定價格，售予統收機構，紗管會實無理由摒絕棉商生計，坐令原屬熟練之收花商失業，增加社會之不安定。當今首要之　，一在保障人民職業，二在協助國家生產。違背此二原則之一切「擱止」法令，終將無法實施。現在國家業已行憲，深　工商界以赤誠擁護合理之政策。否則亦　　籲請之　，提供合法之要求，建議當局採納。想負　之　明當局，當亦能考慮採納。</p>
<p>市商會常務理事楊管北，複製業公會理事長潘士浩，及市商會秘書長嚴諤聲，六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇，理事石鳳翔，劉丕基，均應邀分別致詞，對棉商處境，一致寄予同情云。</p>
<h3>統債外股上漲</h3>
<p>公債昨買風繼續在幣制問題中擴大，統丙晨開三九〇〇〇元，漲到四九〇〇〇元，而後回升盤。成交約九百萬，較前收計甲乙升八千七，統丙漲一萬一，丁種升八千三，統戊好起八千元。</p>
<p>外股昨午後展開漲風，外匯揣測又起，黑市之助長買氣，熱股一致創新高價，怡紗自四五萬起，步漲到五一萬五結束。小型銀行有供，證券帮廣帮則進。結果較前收計墾植尙平，航業漲一成半，電車升半成，餘股均漲一成左右。</p>
<p>進口米棉粉煤等不再照官價結匯</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於美棉米麥麵粉焦煤等輸入結匯問題，央行業務局已於一月五日通知各指定銀行，調上述物資自本月起概依平準會市價結匯。通知之原文略謂：「頃奉行政院令，自本月起實施，所有許可證輸入之棉花米麥麵粉及焦煤等之外匯，應改照平衡委員會之外匯市價結匯，不得再照官價結匯，前通函第五節（A）茲予撤銷」。各指定銀行已遵令辦理。</p>
<p>食糧普遍上漲油市供不應求</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬五千二百餘石，內地重見回漲，人心激昂，追踪升騰，各貨展開全面漲風。粳秞元米一致提高二三萬元，臨收略懈。麵粉漲無止境，直綫上升，繼續奔騰二萬元。麩皮扶搖直上續漲萬元。豆餅高入雲際，狂漲二萬元，迫近卅萬大關。黃豆客方轉動，本街納取，油廠收購甚力，杜黃回升一二萬元，客豆猛加二三萬元。</p>

<p>油市普遍上漲，店　加强，供不應求，生油豆油狂奔二十餘萬元，淸油隨之跟漲七八萬元，菜油蘇油相繼猛騰二十餘萬元。</p>
<h3>紗管會昨又調整議價　棉紗扶搖直上</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會昨日奉准調整棉紗議價，二十支紗改掛三三〇〇萬元，較前提增達百分之十一·八，其他各支紗按比例分別酌定。</p>

<p>又紡建公司昨亦循例售紗，共售九四五件，合二十支紗一六四九件，申騰單共五〇六張。</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市況，以紡建開紗，配價提高，人心激昂，本街複製廠商吸收甚勁，客幫進取仍殷，貨主乘機扳持不願輕脫，市呈求過於供之勢，喊價扶搖直上。四十二支藍鳳細紗最高沖破六千萬大關，爲六千零二十萬元，迨至收時，因有浮多獲利出龍，行情回低至六千萬元收盤，較之上日續漲二百五十萬元。此外各支粗細紗，亦均跟升自八九十萬至一·二·三百萬外不等。</p>
<p>布疋挺秀</p>
<p>棉布市兌，晨開市氣甚俏，紡建公司雖有大最供應，不料開紗配價提高，人心頓吿挺秀，本街進吸，同業逢低添補，更以漢口帮携現鈔來滬採購，北帮及廣帮納　尤健，各布行盤俱創空前高峰。十二磅龍頭細布，塲外價由一百五十一萬五千漲至五十四五萬元，尙難收取，另高至一百六十萬元。比上日步升九萬左右。五　藍鷄振中等細布，亦　漲四·五·六萬元，其餘各布亦一致上升。</p>
<h3>絲綢一路升高</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市再露鋒芒，一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤即高至一億另二百萬元有成交，買氣不衰，節節步高，迄午收盤已達〇九百萬元即期價，下午再揚，最大曾到一千二百萬元，後退做一千萬元，較上日行情漲起一千四百萬元强。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨市因人絲高昂，人心振奮，一致提升。上午做開B字貨一億〇一百萬元，C字貨九千九百萬元，D字貨八百萬元，高另擔七百萬元，交易頗稱熱絡。下午再見高峯，CD等級　價在〇四百萬元左右，不過並無成交，高另擔〇二百萬元有幾擔做開。干經去路較滯，昨市好起三四百萬元不等。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市因原料高漲，廠商以成本關係，廠盤均已提高。華强眞絲被面上午尙稱平定，開市在八百五十萬元左右，收市即期八百十五萬元，隔日期四十萬元，下午乃呈高翔，塲外交易，已達九百五十萬元，格子璧縐大誠單子，上午喊十五萬八千元，下午喊十六萬五千。民生45縐縀開盤廿四萬五千元，華錦縐羽紗等，均比上日大五千元之譜。</p>
<p>市塲買氣沸騰華股高峯疾進</p>
<p>華股昨晨盤午俏，夜報載有食用品改以市價結果匯之訊，黑市又起蠢動，人心若沸，永紗迭創新高價，餘股泰半漲停，俏利非常。</p>
<p>晨開時人心不定，信誼景綸又吿漲停，餘股不過平庸，除現永紗以六二八元登塲外，遞永紗且開低至六二三元，開後遞永紗曾見六二六元，即由以出即交及遞交者多，而跌至現遞均爲六一二元，塲外息價開高至二角四及二角八分半，尙有疲風，內衣掛漲停，永紗升至六二〇元外，賣多而見六一〇元低價。此時關於外匯牌價之揣測又起，業中人奮起哄抬，近午漲勢加强，華新由掛漲停，午收永紗拉高到六三七元及六四〇元高價，收後喊低少許。結果較前收即交股華新信誼景綸內衣漲停，華豐中法升一成，商務大通榮豐尙平，永公好半成，餘者榮辱俱微。遞交股華豐漲一成，勤興微挫，新光平而餘均微升。</p>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>看「美國名人年鑑」</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>上海不久將有一本「上海名人錄」之類的書籍出版，編輯這種書籍向來是吃力不討好，不是讓書中的名人指責「與事實不符」，便要遭讀者認爲有歌功頌德之嫌。因之，我們願把「美國名人年鑑」（Who’s　Who　in　America）的出版前後介紹給續者，看看他們採取着多嚴肅公正的態度來編輯這本煌煌大著，而且也學習他們如何去克服一些想不到的困難；這多少也給從事「名人錄」的出版家和編輯一些參考和借鏡。</p>
<p>在最近一期的「名人年鑑」裏有三千五百多個名人被介紹給全美人民甚至於全世界人民，雖然沒有獎章，報酬和頌語；但他們能名列到這本世界上最榮譽的書內，已够使他們感到光榮了。這光榮不是用金錢可以買到的，多少人曾以賄賂的方式要求名列名人傳中，又有些人曾運用任何手段希望把他傳記載入書內，但都被謹嚴血匿名的編輯「謝絕」了。最初道書編輯時，許多名人接到編者的問答表時，有很多人聲稱除非出版者給他很高的稿費，他不願把自己的生平塡入這問答表內；但當編者解釋，這本書不是營利的，也不是爲任何富商大更所能用錢購買到一頁地位的後，他們多很快的塡好了表給編者。</p>
<p>年鑑每兩年出一期，在過去的四十六年中已出版了二十三期，他們自問良心是沒有一行字是因爲受賄賂而寫上去。假定這本重六磅半的輝煌巨著也像其他一般假冒的「名人傳記」一樣，隨便被富豪利用，為他們頌德宣傳；它的出版者在兩期中就可有一百萬美金的收獲。但是他們沒有被金錢所利用，他們的報酬之少還不如一個小職員，一千多個編輯委員中也只有三十多個拿薪金。</p>
<p>由於編輯的認眞謹嚴，這本書是被全美國讀者所歡迎的，就是在各國的名譽也很高。新近一位美政府高級官員去拜訪土耳其內閣總埋時，在他的書架上就顯著的放着這本書。其實在各國的通訊社，報館，政府官員甚至總統府也都放著這本書，因爲它是眞正介紹着美國的名人的書籍。</p>
<p>它選取「名人」的標準很高，分兩類來選擇：第一是那些在自己所從事的工作上有特殊的成就和威望；第二是由於所處地位的重要，如政府大員等。至於那些由於生理的特殊靈巧，或作奸犯科的要犯，或特殊地位上的名人均在不選之列，所以這本書內沒有體育家，拳擊家或馬戲班內的要角之流，除非他們在其他方面有特別名望者。編輯委員是用盡心機以求其眞實，錯誤是有的，如有些人是用金錢買來的博士學位的，一經査出，立即除名，永不上選。在每一部門中都有推選委員會，再三考核後再送主編委員會去討論，委員們都是隱名者，免得受任何人去左右。由於所負責任的重大而上選的名人一且離開了他的地位，他也就在書中取消了名額。死去各人另編入死亡欄。羅斯福的傳記問答表剛寄到編輯人手中不到幾天就逝世了，所以他已被列入死亡欄了，在下期年鑑中自然不會有他的傳記。</p>
<p>在戰爭中，美國的海陸軍大　擴充，若干新起的將校們天天增加，而他們的活動也擴大到全球各地，這給年鑑的編輯帶來了很大困難，他們的通信地址一天三換，而活動也天天在變化，使出版者追不上這些戰塲上的英雄們，如進軍德國的巴頓將軍和克拉克將軍的寄回的問答表照例遲到，因為當他們快付郵時，又因新活動不能不加上去。在收到的問答表中，最快收到的是那新選入名的名人，愈有名的人物回答的愈簡單，而大學校長或學院院長的回答表又多是咬文嚼字的一篇長論文，至於政府官員，那更冗長的討厭。當然在年鑑中傳記的長短並不能影響他的眞正重要有名。又有些古怪脾氣的名人壓根兒就不把自己的生平寫給編輯委員，那麼編輯只得另請和他親近的人來執筆，不過在書頁中略加小註，並寫一封很婉轉的信給這位名人解釋出版這年鑑的用心。有些名人又要求編輯他寄來的傳記原文不能刪改，但由於節省頁面不能太長的原因，也只好婉轉的解釋一下。這種向編輯提出特別條件的事很多，有幾位宣稱除非過了某一時候，他不能寄回塡好的傳記，因爲過了這時候，也許他得了兒子，或者結婚，意思是要把太太和兒子也寫在自己傳記中。在年鑑中，年齡的眞實也很傷腦筋，大半是婦女最難應付，特別是女明星女演員，他們會在幾期中用同一的年齡，好在這並不太重要。</p>
<p>年鑑從一八九九年開始出第一期來後，年年他們收集了珍貴的名人手筆和照片不在少數，簽名更多，據編者言爲了保持半世紀來這種偉大的出版的優良傳統，這些珍貴東西只能保藏起來，不出讓也不公開，編輯德部設在芝加哥，他們沒有門市部，年鑑的出售價格也不高，因爲他們不是以賺錢爲目的的。（原文節譯自“Coronet”</p>
<h3>「淸代學者著述及生卒年表」訂補</h3>
<p>— 季丹</p>
<p>民國二十二年春間，於北平購得蕭一山先生編纂「淸代學者著述及生卒年表」一書，其中列「遼金二史紀事本末」著者李有棠一條，闕其生卒年月，久欲訂正，旋以戰事作罷。蕭先生編　是書，與其所著「淸代通史」，同爲名世之作，補校再版，當不容緩。茲就所知，李先生有棠生卒及其版籍，敍述如后，俾供參考採擇焉。</p>
<p>先生諱有棠，號芾生，江西萍鄕人。生於道光十七年丁酉二月十五日，卒於光緒三十一年乙已七月十八日。同治甲子優貢，乙丑入都應朝考，考取八旗官學議敎習，授職訓導。光緒庚寅，選授峽江縣訓導，兼理敎論，癸巳因親老解職，是書亦於是年殺靑，付活字排印，是爲初刻本。據先生仲弟有棻（薌垣）譔校刻敍云：</p>
<p>「遼金二史紀事本末，都爲九十二卷，伯氏芾生寄自峽江，余　讀敍例，作書統紀具矣。嘗取袁陳諸家書旁　周覽，通貫累系，獨遼金二代，編著未聞焉，昔四庫館臣，以宋史紀事本末，頗及遼金，謂當稱三史紀事，不得獨以宋標名，詆其偏見。余考陳書，涉及二國者旣　，要為有宋之編，稱名末舛，此特論之疎。然紀遼金，比它史不同，其人名官爵，翻譯未諳，一人迭出，史僞錯者數矣。又其修史率爾，採摭弗廣，漏脫者衆，墨誤時有，蓋踵作之難，命筆匪易，前人請事，獨遺茲編，誠不爲別部厪理耑緒，群起訖巳也。伯氏編集，起自甲申，迄今一紀，始排比成帙」。</p>
<p>乙未，於上海改付石印，合原有中箱本「七種紀事本末」，彙而爲九，是爲重印本，並曾略加修訂。先生晚年復將全書校補增輯，於癸卯冬雕版重刋，歷一週歲，始吿藏事，是爲定本。書末新益先生從子豫（筱垣）譔重刋跋云：</p>
<p>「在昔著作之家，采摭多遺，每嫌簡略。世父積十餘年辛苦，搜討羣書，始於峽江官舍。歲癸已，家君分巡高廉，郵寄來署，適豫改官庶常，入粵省覲，與諸弟奉嚴命，分司襄校，付諸手民。……嗣因精力未衰，丹鉛餘暇，重加編摩，見於二代制誥典章，金石文字，未曾採錄，終難割愛；　中字句，間有訛舛，世父復專精增　，　　補之，譯者糾之，體例仍前，事蹪絞備，於以重以　　，冀免遣憾焉。豫以為古來名　碩彥，著述不厭求詳，即如考亭朱子，亦有晚年定論之書，然編自門入，究不如手爲訂正之為愈也」。</p>
<p>會稽顧家相先生　堂讀書記云：</p>
<p>「紀事本末一類，向有左傳通鑑宋史元史答應秦明史紀事本末，遼金因係偏霸，無人編纂，然實非宋史所能賅，况久已列於正史，列紀事本末，自不可闕。有棠創此二書，實前人履前所未到。初稿刻板於萍鄕，余嘗命工往印，此本乃其姪筱坦太史在上海石印，晚年尚有改定本，則余未之見云」。</p>

<p>— 陸鳳臺</p>
<p>樓雲林編　中華書局出版</p>
<p>最近的中國圖書館界，關於編目方面的著作，先後曾有二本編目法問世。一是民國三十五年正中書局出版金敏甫氏編的「岡書編目學」，一是三十六年六月間中華書局出版樓雲林氏編的「中文岡書編」目法。</p>
<p>本書與金氏「岡書編目法」相比較，可說金氏是着重於對各種書籍編目工作法普遍性的檢討。而本書則除普通書籍編目法之外，對於善本方志興岡年鑑定期刋物等編目法，作詳盡的說明。這可說是本書的特色。</p>
<p>作爲一個文化機關的岡書館，如果它內部範圍較大歷史較久的話，則除普通流通的岡書外，多少總有些善本書籍收藏的·至於方志與圖年鑑期刋更是不諭大小岡書館所共有的。可是對於這類特種圖書的編目法，一向沒有詳細的編目法可資參考。</p>
<p>編目法在圖書館業務中是一件最繁重的工作，而善本的編目更是這繁重工作中的比較難於應付的一環。現在樓氏此書恰好解決了這個難題。其第五章內關於善本書籍的考査版本，稽核篇卷注明款式，鑒別字體，摘記章句符號，審視標記，辨別紙質及墨色，說明裝訂·記載藏印與丹黃，均另立專節詳爲剖晰。得此一篇，對善本書編目的難題，自可迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>報章雜誌，在現代人生中，幾乎已成了我們日常生活的重要部門，蓋其除報導新聞外，舉凡有關文化學術之各種新穎而重要之材料，都散見於各種報章雜誌之中。是以近世以來的學者都以報章雜誌爲治學之重要資料之一。一個圖書館，不論其範圍大小，所訂報章，多則數百種，少則十數種。可是過去對這種報章的編目法，向不詳細，以致散見於各種報章之文化學術資料不能盡量利用。本書對於報章編目法及報軍篇目索引法，亦均詳爲舉例闡明。</p>
<p>全書計二百二十六頁，分八章。第一章總目。第二章圖書分類略述。第三章普通圖書編目法，第四章卡片目錄之寫法，第五章善本書編目法，第六章方志興圖年鑑等編目法，第七章定期刋物編目法，第八章，關於編目之參考書籍。</p>
<h3>「發明家的苦惱」</h3>
<p>— 呂絃</p>
<p>巴爾扎克著　高名凱譯</p>
<p>「發明家的苦惱」是巴爾扎克的「幻滅三部作」之一，那另兩部是「兩詩人」「外省偉人在巴黎」。巴氏的「獨身者三部作」我全看過，只有這「幻滅三部作」看得最少。也許原因是我有點怕看悲劇，也許是由於我們的現實社會已有太多的幻滅的悲劇在演出，使人一看到「幻滅」這字眼就有點害怕了。</p>
<p>但是當我看過「發明家的苦惱」以後，對於巴爾扎克的大乎筆，乃有了更熱烈的景仰之情。——巴氏眼中的「幻滅」，並不是流行着實利主義的社會中人的「幻滅」；正如老莊的虛無傾向，不同於俄國的虛無主義一樣。</p>
<p>故事很單純：頗有學者風度的大衛，開了一家印刷廠，却將廠務全交給僱佣者，自己則專心一志於造紙術的研究。這種辛勤的研究如果一旦成功，即可能使他獲得大量的利潤，立刻暴富起來。大衛完全是一個思想家，一個發明者，心地善良而頭腦單純，因此造紙術尙未發明，他自己成了資本家高恩德兄弟陰謀下的獵物。他的妻弟魯先又惹下了不大不小的禍祟，連累了大衛，使後者不得不亡命隱匿。可是在亡命隱匿的生活中，大衛對造紙術的硏究還是念念不忘，若沒有妻子愛薇的純眞的愛來支助他，大衛的前途是不堪設想的。最後，在惡訟師柏提——克羅的詭計多端的調解下，大衛總算和高恩德兄弟「和解」了，換言之，也就是說心甘情願地做了高恩德兄弟的獵物了。造紙術的硏究雖然全部成功，而大部分的利潤均落入高恩德兄弟之手，大衛自己則變成了高恩德兄弟的僱傭者。</p>
<p>寫出資本家怎樣利用金錢的魔力，迫使發明家俯首爲其奴隸，應該是「發明家的苦惱」的主題；自然，關於十九世紀初期的法國的審判制度，法律的不合理，訟師的險謀等等的描寫刻劃，應該是本書的副主題。在一册短短十餘萬字的小說中，巴爾扎克才氣縱橫地給我們剖析了法國外省生活的若干陰暗面。他在這本小說中按排了十多個人物，如大衛的率直的學者風度，愛薇的迷人的小妻子姿態，老施且爾（大衛的父親）的吝嗇極像老葛　苔，僕人高爾本的忠誠，賽里西的狡詐，資本家高恩德兄弟的唱簧式的機智，律師柏提——克羅的「忍」和「狠」，花花公子魯克的天眞與自滿等等，幾無一不是典型人物。在巴氏的名作中，「發明家的苦惱」的塲面或不及「從妹貝德」（有穆木天譯本，商務版）；精緻或亦不及「歐琴妮，葛蘭苔」（有高名凱譯本，海燕版），但無論如何，這畢竟是一本直接面對法國的審判制度而大聲申斥的巴氏的名著，較之「杜爾的敎士」，「來爾培·薩伐龍」等，我是更愛「發明家的苦惱」的。</p>
<p>在全書中，最可愛的人物自然是大衛與愛機夫婦，這是一對善良的知識份子的典型。沒有愛微的細膩，便無從反映大衛的率直，兩者缺一不可。魯先的天眞自滿的姿態，令人有可憫亦復可恨之感，然而他那闊少的行徑，尙不足以遮蔽他內心的全部純眞，所以在巴氏的筆下，他畢竟不是肯定人物。當他知道自己成了大術的禍害的根源時，他便喪魂落魄地決心要去自殺，巴氏描寫他深夜出走的這一段，有極優美的刻畫。老敎士霍爾拉·卡爾羅縣，是全書中唯一傳奇性的人物，正像巴氏在「高老頭」中穿揷入大盜伏脫冷的情形一橡，巴氏用卡爾羅斯敎士的嘴，說出了自己對當時法國的拜金主義社會的指斥。我尤迷惑於他的這一段話：</p>
<p>「您得改變您的行爲：請您把你的美麗，您的雅趣，您的詩才顯在外面。如果您要做些小小壞事的話，您應當在四個牆壁之內做牠。然後，您就沒有在這名呌世界舞台上的塲地玷下汚點的罪狀。拿破崙管這個呌做：「在家裹洗衣服。」從這裏可以引出一個推論：一切的東西都是形式的。有的沒有受過敎育的人，因爲需要的壓迫就用武力搶奪別人的一筆錢；人家就呌他們做罪犯，他們也就不得不受到法律的制裁。一位有天才的窮人找出一個秘密，這秘密的開發實在就等於寳庫，您給他借去三千法郞，您給他苦頭吃，一直耍讓他把全部的秘密放棄給您，您只用您的良心來計算，而您的良心也不會把您帶到審判罪人的法庭去。……」</p>
<p>這敎士於是敎魯先說：要做社會上的「大人物」，第一，要不怕羞恥；第二，要儘量修飾自己的外表；第三，要幹得秘密。他舉了許多例子，用事實來證明拿破崙·李慈劉·梅迪西斯之流是怎樣爬上了高位的。從他的理論引伸開去，使人自然而然地想起大盜伏脫冷的虛無哲學。巴爾扎克的小說中，這種人物所代表的也許正是巴氏的「第二個我」吧；雖然他的理論顯得太憤世嫉俗了一點。</p>

<h3>「難民皇帝」</h3>
<p>— 靜文</p>
<p>這次冬令救濟，靠着熱心人仕的奔波捐助，成績相當圓滿，但是對眞正赤貧行將斃命的難胞，恐怕仍舊很難有好的帮助，因爲橫亙在他們和救濟所之問，尙有一羣以難民爲生的假難民，也就是所謂「難民皇帝」，他們使救濟品不能嘉惠需要救濟的人，而落在地痞流氓的荷包裏。</p>
<p>通常一個地帶的貧民窟中，總有一個所謂「難民代表」存在，統辦一切救濟事宜，代爲申請各項捐款，兼收築棚掘洞小費，招待聯絡調査人員—見了任何機關團體去訪問發賑，便毛遂自廳，假獻慇勤，並且和同鄕會等取得聯絡：對於難胞們却面目猙獰，惡言相待，可憐剛從他鄕流落滬上的善良的農民，舉目無親，人地兩疏，滿腔委屈，又向誰申訴！數以百億計的救濟鉅款，他們根本很難受着實惠，反之，倒還要把每日要飯所得，獻給「代表」。往往難胞連麵條也吃不飽，而「代表」却腦滿腸肥，烹着上白米飯呢！</p>
<p>他們仗着在上海混了多年，有的在鄕下本來就是土霸劣紳，而有許多辦救濟工作的基層人員如保甲長之類，因爲和難民們言語不通，也有些人們見了這樣汚穢不堪臭氣熏天的情形，不禁望而却步，於是便往「代表」手裏一推，結果是那些寄生蟲就優哉遊哉，可以爲所欲爲了。</p>
<p>他們不但剝削了發下來的救濟物資和捐款，並且還在這些苦難的人們身上打算盤，例如每天拾來的垃圾，都由他們經手轉賣，而曠地空隙上如果有新的難民徙來，也得先孝敬孝敬他們，種種惡劣情形，不一而足，我們如果要把救濟工作辦好，就先得把這種特殊階級的「難民皇帝」澈底剷除！</p>
<h3>歌后自述</h3>
<p>— 程俊濤</p>
<p>精神上的慰藉，可以使一個歌唱家克服物資上，生理上的困難，這是歌后李麗龐絲（Lily　Pons）在近年來所獲的寳貴經驗。</p>
<p>「不要唱得太多」，本來是一個歌唱家的金科玉律。很多年來，李麗龐絲是恪守着的。因爲，據過去醫樂家的經騐，唱得太多時，會使整個人感到疲倦，失去了控制呼吸和發音的力量，以致不能唱出漂亮的聲音來。可是，李麗龐絲在第二次大戰中舉行勞軍音樂會時，却有了新的發現。她覺得祗要精神上能有慰安，多唱點也沒有關係。</p>
<p>平時，李麗龐絲規定每星期最多演唱四次，可是在戰時舉行旅行勞軍音樂會時，每天却平均演唱兩次。歌唱的地點，是在波斯，非洲，義大利，印度，緬甸中國，法國，比利時，和德國的前綫。經過令人暈眩的高空飛行，坐着震動約堅硬的吉普車，吃着那些不講究的食物，都沒有影響李麗龐絲的歌喉。</p>
<p>「我有生以來，從來沒有唱得這樣好！」李麗龐絲在旅行音樂　曾這樣表示。她仔細硏究後，覺得這並不是一件偶然的事。她發現，在她歌唱的時候，她獲得的反應是無上的精神慰藉，無形中，克服了物質上與生理上的困難，並且還加增了她歌唱的效果。她曾有過以下的記錄：</p>
<p>「旅行勞軍音樂會的最重要反應就是那神奇的精神慰藉。在那些勇敢的孩子面前歌唱，和他們捏手，談話，那種快樂眞非言詞可以形容。當我感到我的歌唱還能給他們點慰安時，我眞感到太快樂了！道一種感覺實在給人們一種鋸大的力量。那時，你不會想到個人的舒服，你更沒有時間感到疲倦。假使這些旅行勞軍音樂會所發生的一部分的困難，在平時一個職業化的旅行音樂會發生時，那眞是一般歌唱家的致命傷—我想，他們一定是受不了的。」</p>
<p>從勞軍工作中，李麗龐絲對於人生有了一種新的看法。這一種看法幫助了她的歌唱。她感到，一個藝人如能盡自己的力，給予大衆以精神的慰藉，他一定會有很大的成就。</p>
<p>很多人以爲音樂不易欣賞，可是，根據李麗龐絲的經騐，很多士兵對於音樂本來是沒有什麼硏究的，可是，她感到人們對於「眞·善·美」的東西有一種本能的欣賞能力。巴哈——顧諾的「聖母頌」是李麗龐絲每一次音樂會必囑的節目之一，也是最受歡迎的節目之一。</p>
<p>李麗龐絲表示，現在整個世界都需要「眞·善·美」的音樂的慰藉，也更需要願為大衆服務的藝人！</p>
<h3>五十年以前的電影</h3>
<p>— 柴扉</p>
<p>電影起源於一八九六年，至一九〇三年它從西洋鏡似的小規模經營開始，漸漸有了它的企業基礎，有了它自己的技術，有了它自己的觀衆。</p>
<p>世界最早的電影，係於一八九六年四月二十三日在美國紐約何斯特與巴艾爾音樂廳放映，這音樂廳就是現在場雪公司的舊址。當日紐約時報對於這世界最早的電影，作如下的報道：昨天晚上，音樂廳的燈光完全熄滅了，暗沉沉的角樓裏，熙熙攘攘，人聲鼎沸，不久有道奇怪的光綫向一塊白色幕布直射。於是大家看到兩個遊藝塲的年靑演員，穿着紅色與藍色的服裝，疾速地跳起飛傘舞來。他們的動作，可以說歷歷如繪。當他們隱逝的時候，大家看到一陣驚濤駭浪向沙灘邊的石堤冲擊，誰都不覺大吃一驚。……少項有一個瘦而長的和一個矮而胖的丑角，作滑稽的拳鬥，之後有寓言喜劇，題名呌「門羅主義」，還有從荷伊特喜劇「乳白色的旗」攝取的一個斷片，重複了好多遍。長後由一高大的少女跳飛裙舞作給。所有這些影戲，表演非常眞實，博得滿塲愉快的采聲。</p>
<p>這個新發明所喚起的驚奇顯然是很普遍的，人們簡直把它看成一件神奇的事。活生生的飛傘舞令人目瞪口呆，警濤駭浪呌大家捏把冷汗，歌舞喜劇的再現使人興高采烈，飛裙舞大家也覺得滿意。據發明人愛迪生的助手狄克生說：「這是神奇幻術的新發明，十九世紀的魔道登峯造極了」。</p>
<h3>日憲與偽警</h3>
<p>— 凌霄漢閣</p>
<p>我國派遣憲兵數十名往日本事已屢見報數，據說人數及經費須加考慮，並與盟國接洽，此事必將實現。舊都人士意見，愈速愈好，而人數多少，乃屬次要問題。即便先派一個兩個，往彼東京耀武揚威，亦可稍申八年之積憤。原因是日憲兵屯駐中國時，中華同胞受氣被虐，印象之惡，超越其他倭燄之上。</p>
<p>日本「丘八」及「紗帽」固然名目不一，如所謂「派遣軍司令部，所謂「興亞院聯絡部」，所謂「公使」「領事」之類，各有氣燄，然其所接觸者乃僞政委會之高級官吏，而且多少有些體統手續，與民衆生活尙有相當距離。惟憲兵隊，則橫行霸道，漫無範圍，無人不欺，無事不管，動輙闖入人家捕捉苦虐，市民談虎色變成爲都市之「恐怖物」。</p>
<p>倭之軍政大員欲辦何事，常吿知偽委會以中國官之名義行之，倭憲兵則不顧一切，用「憲兵隊」之頭銜，出布吿，例如糧食支配與彼職權毫不相干，亦張貼告示，不但僞官面子難堪，即倭帥倭長官，亦不在倭憲兵的眼裏。倭部長僞督辦亦有時被倭憲兵傳訊，僅改「傳」爲「請」，就算特別客氣，如汪時璟即常常被「請」之一人。</p>
<p>僑政委會馬下亦有憲兵隊，但無權力，備位而已。偶有照例巡查等事，偽報紙記載須上加「中國」二字，否則人將誤爲倭隊，蓋一提「憲兵」，無人不知爲日本，時謂僞會之「太上政府」不在日軍總部，而在日憲兵，乃是實話，亦是笑話！</p>
<p>此外另一「恐怖物」，則爲敵系之僞「交通警」。敵以其「滿鐵會社」控制華北各鐵路，名曰「華北交通會社」，別組其警隊「華交警」，專在各車站及車上搜檢旅客，任意打駡，毫無理由，其偽女警對於男伶之漂亮者謔浪笑傲，而倭兵則冷笑於旁。即僞職高級官僚及眷屬，若非由倭酋照料，亦難免受僞交警之侮辱，蓋以表示其不受中國官之管轄，爲可以驕人也。</p>
<h3>談題畫</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>題畫詩，貴漢近切貼，猶之書字以「氣韻生動」論畫然，本來詩是意思要深，字句要淺，所謂深入顯出，纔有興味，倘使字句與意思一樣的深，那就不是「頂好」，何况意思淺而字句深呢。相傳我國舊有的打油詩，便是打油工人所創，因爲字句俚俗，所以稱之謂「打油體」，看不起它，其實這是數典而忘其祖，試看待經中國風的一部分，何嘗不就是里巷的歌謠！淸周櫟園先題白頭鳥立桃花上云：「桃花已滿三千歲，靑鳥飛來也白頭。」因為白頭鳥難以下筆，便想出桃樹的年代久遠來襯托着鳥的所以頭白，意思是何等深遠，但這十幾個字，連初小一年級的學生都能認識，你能說它不是好詩嗎？又有一人畫一猴兒睡枯藤上，題之云：「猴兒要醒目今醒，莫待藤枯樹倒時。」眞堪發人猛省。又某題靑樓女花姓小照云：「如此銷魂定姓花」七字，亦極生動話，惜手頭無畫，不能詳舉姓名矣。）他如明人吳偉題盡云：「白頭一老子，騎　去飲水；岸上蹄踏蹄，水中嘴對嘴。」眞是實地意境，可稱絕唱。又無名氏題畫乞兒云：「我討我的飯，與汝何相干；生成勢利犬，單咬破衣衫！」其寄寓社會勢利情形，刻畫入微。讀之無限感慨。至如元人馮海粟題楊貴妃病齒圖小曲云：「淸華宮，一齒痛，馬嵬坡，一身痛，漁陽擊鼓動地來，天下痛！」聊聊數語，爽快之至！</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　如此良宵（三五）</p>
<p>渚　向櫃內衣服看了一看，又用手在手提　按一按，笑道：「你不用急，我給你試試看。」因把提箱內的衣服全部拿出，重新一件一件疊好，很細心地，四平八穩，一件一件裝在箱內，並且放去非常有次序。綺紈起先還帮着他拿衣服，後來見渚齋把她已疊好的衣服，重新又疊過，必須恰合箱內面積大小，才放進去，因笑道：「渚，你做事和女人一樣，細緻極了，我是急性人，不如你！」說着，雙手向腰問一揷，便不動手，靜看渚齋收拾。渚齋毫不憚煩，很有次序，把所有衣服，全部裝在箱內，然後用力一按，把箱子扣好，對綺紈一笑道：「怎麼樣？我把牠都裝進去了！」喜得綺紈凑到渚齋跟前，緊握他的手，連搖幾搖道：「謝謝你！謝謝你！我眞想不到，你這人，上次在什刹海，那麼英勇，今天收拾東西，又這樣細緻。你可累了，時間也不早，請歇歇吧！」說着，拉了渚齋的手，同到外間屋裏，見靠在牆邊，王媽已經搭好一架小牀，上面被頭毛毯，都舖得很整齊。綺紈指着小牀道：「委曲你，就在這牀上休思一會，天也就亮了。」渚齋道：「何必呢！我坐一會就可以了。」綺紈道：「那不行，你還是躺下好，閉閉眼睛，養養神。」渚齋見她再三催促，只好把西服上衣脫下，躺在小牀上，綺紈親手把他的被和毛毯蓋好，左右都塞嚴密，才舉手說一聲「明天見！」嫣然一笑，回轉身，　然走入臥室。渚齋的情感，經她這一番激盪，心頭仍是突突跳動，那能入睡。閉上眼睛，綺紈的秀　笑頰，立現在眼前，耳邊只聽戶外呼呼的風聲，吹撼得窗戶沙沙作響，躺在牀上，輾轉反側，只是睡不不着。想綺紈　情蜜意，中人欲醉，這樣可人兒，明日便要遠去，心上陡生惜別之念，不由微微嘆了一口氣，立時聽到綺紈在臥室裏問道：「渚，你還沒睡呀？」渚齋笑道：「是的，我睡不着，你呢？」椅紈道：「我也睡不着，外面風很大，我聽了風聲，心裏格外難過。」渚齋應道：「可不是嗎？　也是這樣！」綺紈道：「現在已經五點種，再有一個鐘頭，天就亮了，你旣然睡不着，不如進來談談。」渚齋一聽這話，一翻身，便坐起來，也不及穿上衣，就趕進臥室內，只見綺紈身擁一牀錦緞棉被，微微含笑。不禁神魂　蕩！突聽將紈說道：「我這人是好高的，好面子的。」祗這兩句話好似最錦暮鼓一般，立時警醒了他的痴迷。暗忖我是崇敬她，我對她是純潔的愛，最高尙的愛，豈可轉入狎暱一途！我是有婦之夫，那好如此！在此一剎那間，腦筋祗這一轉念，不期站住，對綺紈笑道：「對不起！」</p>
<h3>勸募聲中</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>去年歲尾，我和內人到國貨公司買東西，剛走上樓梯，就有幾位靑年中學生當前攔住，含笑要我捐一點錢給貧苦難民做寒衣。他們的衣襟上都佩有長方形的憑證，懸掛校徽，態度也極懇切，我當然很高興地捐了一點錢，他們立刻在國貨公司的貨櫃上匆匆塡具收據給我。那時，我不禁對他們發生了一種又感激又喜歡的感覺。</p>
<p>新年休假三天，我帶了孩子逛公園去。正扶着他在草地上試步，忽然抬頭一看，眼前站了三個靑年人，兩男一女，對我說：「我們是××大學的學生，因為下學期學費實在太貴，許多同學都有失學的危險，所以我們發動了一次募捐，請先生帮一點忙·」我拿出了一點錢，他們連連稱謝，給我一張印刷很好的長方形卡紙，上面印眘號數和金額—就是好像還缺少了一個負責捐募機關的圖章。</p>
<p>前天中午，我從寫字間裏出來，到一家廣東館子吃中飯，剛點好菜，忽然來了一個像是學生似的靑年，手裏捧着一大疊書，大約有二三十本罷，走到我的面前，把書放在桌上，說：「我是××大學的學生，因為下學期學費太貴，所以販了一些書，請先生買幾本。」我倒確是想買他一兩本的，但是一看那些書各却呌我怔住了——全是什麼「明星歌選」，「中西電影歌曲」，還有幾本很「黃色」的小說。祗有一本「雙城記」差强人意，然而我的心有些冷了。也許我遲疑得大長久了一點，那位靑年人冷冷地說了一聲「對不住」，已經轉身到別桌子上去了。</p>
<p>方才，我想去看電影，那部戲的編導是我十多年的老友了，所以看見了影院門前的客滿牌，雖然因無法入塲而感遺憾，却也為老友歡喜，便站着看櫥窗裏那些劇照。不想，正在這時，又是一位衣冠楚楚的靑年走到我面前，笑着低聲說，他有戲票。他說的價錢比戲票的定價要貴一半以上，他解釋着說：「沒有辦法，下學期的學費太高了，所以……」。</p>
<p>然而，我祗覺得無限的恨惘，實在已經沒有看戲的心情了。</p>
<h3>馬尼拉談屑</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>常見報戰，馬尼刺颶風爲災，她便成爲新聞中的重要標題，爰摭拾該城瑣事，爲本刋補白。</p>
<p>馬尼拉是菲律賓開化甚早的城市。遠在一千五百七十年間，已與西班牙人發生接觸。當地的土著盛傳這些洋人是吃石子，吞火，生尾巴的怪物，因此最初對他們很恐懼。後來中國人，荷蘭人，英國人和美國人先後到達該地，他們也就司空見慣了。據說菲列濱人最歡喜美國人，並不因爲美國人待他們特別好，却因爲美國人傳入可口可樂的緣故。</p>
<p>十六世紀初葉，移居馬尼拉的西班牙人，已與我國有貿易往來。我國商人携往的貨物有絲綢，瓷器等，馬尼拉的出口貨，則以魚翅，海味等佔大宗。</p>
<p>馬尼拉的語言十分複雜，計分八大類，共有八十餘種。每一個馬尼拉人必須是一個天生的語言家，否則不足以應付日常的交際。當地還有一種怪病，土名「嘛哩嘛哩」（Mali　mali），病者遇見任何人，就模倣對方的嘗語和舉動，無法自制。</p>
<p>馬尼拉的女人很能幹。全市牙醫生中，約有半數爲女性。戰前一家規模浩大的馬尼拉內陸航空公司，所聘總經理，也是一位女性事業家。</p>
<p>聖湯麥斯是當地年代最久的一座大學，比美国哈佛大學成立更早。</p>

<h3>Truman's Statement to Congress: Special Aid to China Plan to be Proposed Soon; Yu Ta-wei and Bei Zuyi's Trip to the US Postponed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] President Truman personally delivered a 5,000-word message to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on the 7th, promising to provide assistance to China in the near future. Truman's message focused on domestic policy and the European recovery plan, and did not mention any other foreign countries by name except for China. When promising to include China in the broad plan for the United States to assist in world recovery to achieve peace, Truman explicitly stated that he would soon submit a special plan for China to Congress.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The departure of Yu Ta-wei and Bei Zuyi, high-ranking officials to the United States, has been decided to be postponed. Bei was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 7th, but this has been suspended due to unforeseen circumstances. It is rumored that the delay may be due to insufficient preparation of materials.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Shi Zhaoying, acting director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated in response to reporters' inquiries on the 7th that the visit to the United States by Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei and former Governor of the Central Bank Bei Zuyi was originally suggested by the Chinese government and agreed upon by the U.S. State Department. The date of their trip to the United States has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, told United Press reporters here today that the Chinese government will submit a concrete plan for further U.S. aid to China to the United States within a week. The content will inform the United States of China's current situation and self-help capabilities, and make recommendations on where the United States can continue to assist China's needs. Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei will likely lead the Chinese delegation to negotiate. Yu cooperated with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall when Marshall was in China. The departure date of the delegation is unknown. The recovery plan that China intends to submit to the United States is the result of a review by a five-member committee appointed by President Chiang Kai-shek some time ago. Zhang did not want to speculate on what kind of statement the Chinese representatives would make to the U.S. government, only stating that financial reform and currency stabilization are fundamental problems for China, and estimated that 400 million U.S. dollars would be enough to stabilize China's currency system. Zhang spoke of Marshall's aid to Europe plan, saying that approximately 1.5 billion or 2 billion U.S. dollars could meet all of China's needs. Zhang is now heading to Seattle to lecture on the new Chinese constitution at the University of Washington for two months.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government's Foreign Aid Should Include Far Eastern Countries; Some Congressmen Consider a Broad Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th (United Press)] On the first day of the current session of Congress, there were strong signs that some congressmen were considering expanding the Marshall European Recovery Plan into a broader plan that would include the Far East. This is because the current government's plan is not consistent, as government officials have stated that in the short term, they are willing to focus their efforts on Europe, except for a specific aid to China plan. Republican Congressman Herter of Massachusetts, who has considerable influence in Congress, frankly stated that he will oppose the Marshall Plan proposed by the government, because the plan, when the time is ripe, still cannot include Japan, China, and other regions of the Far East in the government's foreign aid. Herter did not make a definite prediction, but said that he believes that under a general plan, aid to Japan can be implemented immediately after the signing of the peace treaty and the end of the military occupation, and aid to China will also be implemented under a general plan, rather than a separate plan. Herter led a special congressional committee to Europe last June to investigate relief needs and recently submitted a bill advocating that global aid should be implemented under a bipartisan institution, rather than the Marshall Plan, which is said to be promoted by the Secretary of State. Herter argued that the Secretary of State can only direct the diplomatic policy part of the relief plan, but has no actual implementation authority. Regarding the control of allocation, he advocated concentrating it under a new institution, rather than being managed by the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce. He pointed out the score and distribution of the global relief plan, saying: "Last year, our exports to the 16 countries participating in the Paris Conference accounted for only one-third of the total exports, and the rest were exported to the Far East, South America, and other regions. Few people understand this point."</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide Broadcasts: Seeking Aid to China to Fight for Freedom</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] Republican Congressman Zhou Yide delivered a broadcast speech on the air tonight, saying that the best opportunity for the United States to prevent a third world war is to do everything possible to ensure that the Soviet Union cannot control China. If the United States fails to aid China now, then the manpower and money it sacrificed in the Pacific War will be wasted. Rather than allowing the Soviet Union to control China, it would be better to allow Japan to take over China in the past. China needs economic reform, but President Chiang Kai-shek is well aware of this. If the United States hopes for the Chinese government to improve, it should support the government's efforts to fight for freedom. Zhou also said that the less the United States aids China, the more miserable China will be. The more miserable China is, the less aid it will receive. This vicious cycle must be broken. At the same time, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Litvinoff also participated in the radio program and expressed support for Zhou's proposal. However, Far East experts, such as Dr. Lattimore, president of the International College of Hopkins University, and Lauterbach, former Life magazine reporter in China, had different views. According to Lattimore, Americans are less popular in China than Soviet personnel. Currently, the Chinese people are very patriotic and oppose the interference of the country in Chinese internal affairs the most. Unfortunately, there are thousands of American military advisors stationed in China, and all the aircraft used to bomb Chinese villages are made in the United States. It is increasingly clear that the CCP has not accepted Soviet arms supplies. Qualified American journalists who have been paying attention to the evidence of Soviet aid to the CCP for years have found nothing.</p>
<h3>No Reaction from American Businesses to Our Increased Import Tax; Some Exporters Express Sympathy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] American exporters who engage in trade with China have not yet reacted to China's increase in import tax by 50%. They either do not know about the new measures or are waiting for detailed reports. According to a spokesperson for the New York Export Managers Club, only a few American exporters ship goods to China for trade, so "most exporters have not considered this issue." He said: "Any tax increase measure will naturally restrict exports to China." According to a spokesperson for the National Foreign Trade Council, in the short term, a 50% additional tax will have little impact on American exports to China, because China's demand for American goods is currently urgent and will not be hindered by high tax rates. However, in the long term, it is naturally unfavorable, because this method restricts American exports to China. A major exporter expressed sympathy for the Chinese government's increase in tariffs in order to obtain urgently needed national income, but declined to judge how the tariff increase would affect his business.</p>

<h3>Japanese Weapons Fall into CCP Hands; U.S. Demands Explanation from Soviet Union; Heated Debate in Allied Control Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] There was no "formal" item on the agenda before the meeting of the Allied Council for Japan on the morning of the 7th, but in the course of the meeting, a heated debate suddenly broke out between the U.S. and Soviet representatives. The chairman, U.S. representative Sebald, told Soviet Deputy Representative Major General Kislenko that recent reports stated that all the weapons of the Japanese Kwantung Army had been received by the Soviet Union in 1945, but had fallen into the hands of the CCP army.

<h3>Kowloon City Houses Demolished; Many Residents Live in Ruins; Our Protest Letter Delivered to Hong Kong Government by British Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] British Ambassador to China, Bean, officially stated on the 7th that the embassy has received the protest from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Kowloon incident and has immediately conveyed it to the Hong Kong government for their information. In addition, people at the embassy declined to express any opinions, but according to what reporters know, the British side views the Kowloon incident as a local incident, which occurred when the Hong Kong government exercised its right to use the land for local health and construction purposes. Our government believes that no matter how the sovereignty or right to use the area is ultimately resolved, the Hong Kong side's compulsory measures are unfriendly. The purpose of our protest is first to make the Hong Kong side pay attention to the traditional friendship between China and Britain, and then to seek a fundamental solution to the dispute through diplomatic channels. The consequences of the Kowloon incident are not just local events, but have indeed involved the friendship between China and Britain. Future developments will depend on how the Hong Kong side considers this matter rationally.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th] The Hong Kong government's forced demolition of houses in Kowloon City has aroused unusual indignation from all walks of life here. Newspapers have simultaneously published articles accusing the Hong Kong government of deliberately infringing on our territorial sovereignty and creating an unusual incident. Various people's organizations in Guangzhou and Guangdong will consult in the coming days to provide effective assistance to the compatriots who have been demolished. The Provincial Council is also preparing to unite representatives of people's organizations to form a visiting group to Kowloon City to express condolences to the victims and conduct a detailed investigation of the situation in order to deal with it effectively.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 7th] The once bustling Kowloon Old City has now been reduced to a pile of broken boards.

<h3>National Flag Flying on Independence Day; Ye Wai-tz and Others to Leave Burma and Return Home Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London 7th Broadcast: Yangon News, Chinese Ye Wai-tz claimed that China has the most friendly good neighborly spirit to independent Burma. Rumors that China has aggressive ambitions towards Burma are absurd. Border disputes between China and Burma must be fairly resolved by a joint committee organized by the two countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yangon, 7th] At 8 pm last night at the residence of U Myint Thein, the appointed Burmese ambassador to China, there was a major event enough to prove the friendly relations between China and Burma. That is, Burmese Foreign Minister U Tin Tut, after the British flag was lowered at 4:20 am on January 4, the Burmese Independence Memorial Day, presented the historical Burmese national flag that had been flying to the Chinese Envoy Lai Te. Among those who attacked this grand ceremony were the Chinese special representative, Madame Aung San, and a few friends of U Myint Thein. Before presenting the flag, U Tin Tut made the following brief remarks: "Envoy, I would like to present this Burmese national flag, which was made according to standard dimensions and flew on the flagpole on Independence Memorial Day, to you as a symbol of the diplomatic relations between China and Burma. I would like to express my gratitude to your country for sending such an outstanding person as you to the Kingdom to participate in the Independence Memorial Ceremony." After receiving the flag, Envoy Ye replied as follows: "I am deeply grateful for your beautiful gift, and I am deeply grateful for its full meaning. I am pleased to accept it with this feeling. I would like to assure you that when this flag flies in China, it will receive the highest respect of the Chinese people." The Burmese national flag is quite similar to our national flag in terms of color and design, but in addition to the blue sky, white sun, and red earth, five stars have been added. These five stars represent the five ethnic groups that make up the Burmese Federation: the Burmese, Kachin, Karen, Shan, and Chin. This historical Burmese national flag will be brought back to China by our country's special envoy group on the day of leaving Burma on the 8th.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Fair Discussion of the Kowloon Walled City Incident</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government's forced eviction of 2,000 residents from the Kowloon Walled City has suddenly escalated in recent days. The incident began when the Hong Kong government's Public Works Department issued a notice on November 27th of last year, ordering the "compulsory relocation" of 2,000 residents of the Kowloon Walled City, with a deadline of December 11th. The residents of Kowloon Walled City, believing that the area belonged to China and that administrative power still rested with the Chinese government, organized a residents' association to petition the local government and the diplomatic commissioner, and publicly declared that they would not hesitate to risk bloodshed. Guo Dehua, the diplomatic commissioner stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi, in addition to drawing the Hong Kong government's attention to the matter, once went to Nanjing to seek instructions, hoping to resolve the case through diplomatic means. December 11th passed without incident in Kowloon Walled City, but the magistrate of the Kowloon New Territories issued summonses to the representatives of the Kowloon Walled City Residents' Association. The representatives remained steadfast in the face of adversity and refused to accept the Hong Kong authorities' illegal summonses, resulting in the arrest of two representatives. On the 5th of this month, the Hong Kong government further escalated the situation, mobilizing 250 police special forces to enter the Kowloon Walled City to carry out demolition work, leaving a large number of residents homeless in the ruins. Judging from the Hong Kong police's capabilities, the first step of their action is to demolish the civil houses in Kowloon Walled City, the second step is to drive the homeless Chinese out of the country, and the last step is to establish police power and complete its occupation. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the Hong Kong government against this forced action. We are deeply concerned about this incident and hope that the government will reason with the British government and effectively prevent the Hong Kong police from infringing on China's sovereignty through unreasonable actions.</p>
<p>The Kowloon Walled City is located in the northeast corner of the Kowloon Peninsula. In the late Qing Dynasty, it was called "Kowloon Fortress" and had city walls to defend the sea. In the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1842 AD), during the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing was forcibly signed, ceding Hong Kong to Britain. In 1860, Britain continued to lease Kowloon (known as the New Territories of Kowloon) as a shield for Hong Kong. However, the old site of the Kowloon Walled City and Longjin Avenue still belonged to Chinese territory and were under the jurisdiction of the An'an County of Guangdong Province. On June 9, 1898, China and Britain signed the "Convention between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory," which stipulated the boundary between Hong Kong and Kowloon Walled City, stating: "The Chinese officials now stationed in the city of Kowloon shall continue to exercise jurisdiction there, but shall not interfere in any way with the maintenance of law and order in the leased territory. Chinese merchant vessels may use Kowloon Bay as a harbor, and continue to enjoy the use of the jetties and landing-places near Kowloon City." It was also agreed that "within the area to be expanded, residents must not be forced to relocate, and property must not be confiscated." It is very clear that the Kowloon Walled City is territory belonging to Chinese sovereignty. Chinese officials can not only exercise their functions within the boundary but also Chinese people have the freedom to reside in the area and are not allowed to be interfered with in any way. The weak Qing government ceded Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula, leaving only the smallest area of Kowloon Walled City, allowing Guangdong Province, the richest in the country, to hold on to it until today. Our people have always expected a reasonable solution to the Hong Kong issue, especially after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong issue after the war remains unresolved, and the Hong Kong government has instead intensified its efforts, violating previous agreements, forcing the residents of Kowloon Walled City to relocate, intending to forcibly occupy Chinese territory and expand the scope of British-controlled Hong Kong. In order to safeguard national territorial sovereignty and protect the lives and property of 2,000 residents, in addition to sympathizing with the Kowloon Walled City residents' reasoned resistance, we also hope that the diplomatic authorities will take vigorous negotiations after the customary protest.</p>
<p>British colonial policy in the 18th century originally had the intention of expanding the scope of Hong Kong and developing economic power in the Far East. In August 1842, Hong Kong was seized; in October 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula was seized; in June 1898, the boundary was surveyed, expanding the scope of Hong Kong. However, the Hong Kong government did not give up on seizing Kowloon Walled City. In 1933, 1936, 1939, and September 1947, there were four forced relocations of Kowloon Walled City residents. This is now the fifth action. The dispute in 1936 was quite serious, and the houses in Kowloon Walled City were almost completely demolished. At that time, due to the residents' firm resistance, the national public opinion rallied in support, and the five-province diplomatic officials reasoned and fought without yielding, thus preserving this piece of land for China. In particular, Mr. Jie Hou's adaptable attitude and courageous spirit, never retreating an inch of territory, forced the Hong Kong government to retreat under justice, and there was still the legacy of revolutionary diplomacy in 1927. Therefore, in order to protect this small piece of land, we have had a glorious history, and we have shown firm struggle in diplomacy and administration. This dispute is more serious than the previous incidents. We want to see whether the diplomatic authorities, for the sake of past glory, will continue to adopt a positive, rational attitude and steps to preserve the sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City.</p>
<p>Therefore, we call on the government authorities, after the protest from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to make a prompt decision and coordinate effective administrative actions to prevent the Hong Kong police from invading Kowloon Walled City, and to demand that the Hong Kong authorities release the arrested residents' representatives and compensate the residents of Kowloon Walled City for the losses they have suffered in life and property. If we fail to seize the opportunity in diplomacy and administration and take appropriate measures, resulting in the loss of sovereignty over Kowloon Walled City, this will affect the country's credibility</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities will recognize the long-term relationship between China and Britain and refrain from actions that stimulate the feelings of the Chinese people. The Kowloon Walled City issue does not involve a dispute over treaty interpretation. We are delighted to see Britain's withdrawal from India and the independence of Burma, and we hope that the British authorities will also adopt an enlightened attitude and handle the Kowloon issue properly. Strictly speaking, Kowloon Walled City itself is a place that the Hong Kong government's power cannot reach. Even for security reasons, it should first stabilize the people's hearts, and absolutely not allow the demolition of houses and forced relocation to occur. We value the good relations between China and Britain and hope that the Hong Kong authorities can quickly regain their senses and stop this kind of action!</p>

<h3>Japanese Armaments Issue</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] Gilmin stated: The US representative attempted to conceal the truth and obstruct discussions by the committee. Regarding discussions and control of Japan, Sebald denied concealing the truth and stated: The information now requested by the Soviet Union had already been obtained. The Soviet representative stated: He requested information relating to the disarmament of Japan, including airfields, arsenals, coastal defenses, and other relevant materials, up to the end of 1947. He stated: When he proposed including this item on the agenda for the 7th, Mr. Sebald invited him for a conversation and told him that the item was not intended to be included on the agenda. Mr. Gil stated: The US representative's reasons were insufficient, and he wished to protest this "dictatorial" behavior and denied that Mr. Sebald had stated that the Soviet Union's request had ever been referenced in the charter. Sebald revealed that the Soviet Union's request included ten independent issues regarding the disarmament of Japan, but he did not elaborate. Mr. Sebald reiterated that the Soviet representatives in Japan and in the Far Eastern Commission in Washington DC were aware of all the information they were now requesting.</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union raised the issue of Japanese heavy armaments, Sebald told Mr. Gil: The Soviet Union received a request on September 18, 1946, instructing it to provide information on Japanese armaments in the Northeast. The Soviet Union replied at the time that it could not report until all the information had been compiled. Although the Soviet Union had published a report shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945, Sebald stated that this report was superficial in nature and intended solely for press use. Mr. Sebald also stated: Recent newspapers have pointed out that the armaments of the Japanese Kwantung Army have fallen into the hands of the Chinese Communists. The United States hopes to learn the truth about this situation. He stated: A detailed report from the Japanese Armaments Office would help the Military Commission to draft a final report on the disposition of the Japanese military organization. Gromyko declared: The news regarding the Northeast is completely irrelevant to the situation in Japan. Mr. Sebald retorted: "Then does your representative deny that the Kwantung Army was part of the Japanese army?" The Soviet representative accused Mr. Sebald of requesting information outside the committee's jurisdiction. He stated that Mr. Sebald's remarks regarding the Chinese Communists were intended to divert attention and conceal his own "fault" in not including the item proposed by the Soviet Union on the agenda. He stated: If the United States were not concealing the truth, the requested information should have been published long ago. There is no excuse for not discussing this issue. Mr. Gil openly insisted on including his request on the agenda for the next meeting, but Mr. Sebald also firmly refused to yield. He stated that a similar report had been provided to the Soviet Union a year ago. In addition, the information obtained by the Far Eastern Commission was extremely detailed. Mr. Sebald then accused the Soviet Union of abusing the committee. He stated: It is time to stop this abuse. "I have tried to make this committee a constructive institution, but it has apparently failed."</p>
<p>The Soviet representative then turned to inquire about the opinions of the Chinese and British representatives. General Shang Zhen, the Chinese representative, stated that he had no criticism at present and that it was up to the chairman, Mr. Sebald, to decide whether the Soviet Union's item should be included on the agenda. Mr. Shaw, the British representative, stated that he was always able to obtain the information he needed, seemingly supporting the US position, but he also stated: There should be no restrictions on the inclusion of "appropriate issues" on the agenda of the province.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Grain Market Suspended; Black Market Enters Chaotic State; Zhenjiang Organizes Economic Inspection Team</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 7th] Today's rice prices are severely restricted by the provincial authorities, with white japonica rice not allowed to exceed one million per shi. However, investigations reveal that various banks and warehouses are piled high with goods. Due to hoarding, the market has been suspended, and the black market outside the market has entered a chaotic state. Prices of various goods have soared accordingly. White rice is sold for one million, and the black market has reached a new high of 1.27 million. Warship flour is at 580,000, cotton yarn is at 37.8 million, a sudden jump of 14 million, and soybean oil is at 2.95 million. All other goods have soared uniformly.</p>

Underground money houses charge a daily interest rate of 1.2%, but speculators still flock to them like startled birds. Prices continue to rise, and cooked rice is almost non-existent in the market. Coarse rice sells for 1.08 million per shi, soybean oil sells for 32,000 per catty, and pork sells for 30,000 per catty, with prices still expected to rise. Kerosene is in great demand because electric lights have not yet been restored, and it sells for 20,000 per catty today. Elementary school teachers, due to their low salaries and the fact that they are often owed several months' pay, have difficulty getting enough to eat all day and rely on selling newspapers to make a living, a very miserable situation.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchant Zhen Pingzhai Manifests Great Righteousness, Suppresses Price Increases, Voluntarily Reduces Prices, and Sells Off Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] As grain prices are being raised competitively and stockpiled, a righteous merchant, Zhen Pingzhai, has suddenly appeared in Beiping, voluntarily reducing prices for sale, which has greatly impacted the market.

Recently, grain prices have fluctuated sharply. On the 3rd, the market price of rice rose to 24,000 per catty, but he raised his arms and shouted, selling 600,000 catties at 19,000. After selling tens of thousands of catties, grain prices immediately fell as a result. Since then, he has been coming to the market every day to sell at reduced prices. Upon hearing the news, the Beiping Social Affairs Bureau decided to submit a commendation to the municipal government.</p>

<h3>Victory Over Bandits Arrives with the New Year: Deng Wenyi Reports on a Week of Battles</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch from the seventh] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported at a press conference on the afternoon of the seventh on the week of battles from December 31, 1947, to January 6, 1948, stating: The military suppression of bandits has achieved new victories with the arrival of the New Year of 1948. Frequent reports of victories from various fronts symbolize the beginning of this triumph. A breakdown of the battle situation on each front within the week is as follows:</p>
<p>Northeast Theater: Bandit forces briefly approached the outskirts of Pan last week, but were annihilated by a Nationalist counterattack. In the four days from December 29 to January 2, Nationalist forces inflicted fatal blows on the attacking bandit forces of the First, Third, Sixth, and Tenth Columns in areas such as Wanjintai and Pangutai in northern Liaoning. The bandits suffered heavy losses and fled in disarray towards the southeast and northwest of Faku. On the Liaoxi front, the Eighth and Ninth Columns of bandits attacking Xinlitun were counter-encircled by Nationalist forces, suffering over ten thousand casualties. On January 3, a portion retreated towards Beizhen and Heishan, where Nationalist forces are currently attacking them. The Fourth Column of bandits in southern Liaoning is being encircled and attacked by Nationalist forces. Simultaneously, our air force achieved brilliant results in the Northeast on January 5, killing over five hundred bandits near Changchun and destroying many bandit transport units and heavily loaded vehicles southwest of Faku, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits.</p>
<p>Hebei-Chahar Front: The Ronghe bandit forces attempted to disrupt the Pingbao and Pingsui railways and threaten Bao Yuan. Over the past week, Nationalist forces launched a multi-pronged campaign, initially annihilating over ten thousand bandits near Yanqing, southern Chahar, on January 3. The Independent Brigade harassing the Pingsui Railway has been reduced to only one thousand men and is fleeing north, resulting in the first major victory of the New Year. Subsequently, on January 4, another brigade of the Fourth Column was annihilated near Pinggang, Dingxian. The Third Column is also currently surrounded by our forces. Nationalist forces on the North China front have achieved outstanding results.</p>
<p>Dabie Mountain Area: The Liu bandits, in an attempt to evade Nationalist encirclement, have broken into smaller groups and scattered into the mountains. Their First Column is wandering in the areas north and south of Runan. The Liu bandits' Second and Third Columns have broken into several small groups and scattered in the areas south of Shucheng and Tongcheng, and north of Qianshan and Taihu. The Sixth Column has scattered east of Jingfu and into the Shangba River and Tongzi River areas. The Tenth Column, which fled to Xinye, and the remnants of the Twelfth Column of bandits in Dahong Mountain, are being searched and suppressed by Nationalist forces and local militias. Additionally, the main force of the Liu bandits' Jianghan Independent Brigade, led by Luo Houfu, is still being contained by Nationalist forces at Xingouzuizi, north of Jianli, wandering aimlessly. A group of over three hundred bandits who escaped to Wuxue was defeated by local forces on the fifth, and Wuxue has returned to its original state.</p>
<p>Lu-Yu Border Region: Chen Yi's bandit forces, the Eighth and Eleventh Columns, besieged Heze and suffered heavy losses. A portion has now fled north. The First, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns, after participating in the attack on Queshan and Yancheng, suffered significant casualties. Except for the Sixth Column, which is still on the outskirts of Yancheng, the First, Third, and Fourth Columns have all scattered into the area between Shangshui, Xiangcheng, and Runan. Nationalist forces are launching a three-pronged encirclement from the east, west, and north.</p>
<p>Chen Geng's bandit forces, the Fourth and Ninth Columns, after failing to besiege Queshan, were counterattacked by Nationalist forces. On December 31, the siege of Queshan was lifted. The Ninth Column entrenched itself in the Wuyang and Bao'an area, while the Fourth Column scattered near Yancheng. Subsequently, after a multi-pronged attack by Nationalist forces, the two columns retreated to the vicinity of Biyang on January 5. There is currently no major fighting in that area.</p>
<p>Overall, the bandit situation on various fronts this week confirms that the bandit forces have no clear operational objectives and are merely hoping to achieve a lucky victory. Their strategy of breaking into smaller groups and scattering is simply an attempt to prolong their survival by looting and harming the people. This kind of violent banditry, if allowed to continue, will inevitably arouse popular hatred and shorten the distance to their destruction. We can conclude that the development of the communist bandits last year has reached its peak. The fading light is disappearing with the end of the year. The Nationalist forces' suppression of bandits may be more difficult in the future, but continuous victories will come with the New Year.</p>

<h3>Truman Submits Message to Congress Urging Approval of Aid to Europe Plan; Reveals Five Major Policy Directions for the Future</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 7th, Washington report, President Truman today submitted a message to Congress, strongly urging Congress to pass $6.8 billion in aid to Europe, as the initial 15 months of the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. Mr. Truman also said: The result of economic cooperation between the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere can lead to the early realization of the aid to China plan. He pointed out that the "Truman Doctrine" has maintained the integrity of Greece and Turkey, and promised to work hard to sign peace treaties with Germany, Austria, Japan, and South Korea, although these efforts are currently being obstructed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] President Truman personally read his annual Congressional Inauguration Message to Congress on the 7th, urging Congress to abandon partisan views, quickly approve the European Recovery Plan, and give him effective weapons to stop the domestic runaway price inflation trend as soon as possible. Truman put forward a broad legislative plan to supplement the New Deal policy created by the late President Roosevelt. He said: "We can increase the national annual production by at least one-third compared with the current level. We can raise the living standard to a level that is one billion higher than ten years ago. We can make significant progress in eliminating poverty in this generation." Regarding the aid to Europe plan, he emphasized that congressional approval of the $6.8 billion in aid to Europe for the first fifteen months starting on April 1 is of the utmost importance. He also reiterated the request to control wages and prices and implement quantitative distribution in order to prevent the reduction of living standards and the formation of economic panic. Mr. Truman also put forward five major guidelines to the American people in his message, which can enable the United States to complete a glorious future in the next ten years: * Obtain full and major human rights for American citizens; * Protect and develop America's national resources; * Maintain and use national resources to promote the welfare of the people; * Improve the living standards of all people in the country by strengthening the economic system and enabling the people to share the national production; * Achieve world peace based on the principles of freedom, equality, and justice for all countries.</p>
<h3>Promoting the Marshall Plan Striving for Coordination Among All Nationalities</h3>
<p>Regarding the tax plan, he proposed reducing the tax amount for those with low incomes and increasing the profit tax for large enterprises by 3.2 billion yuan. He also put forward a comprehensive social security system, including unemployment relief and health assistance, etc. He also advocated expanding public works projects, such as building water gates, electrical engineering, and land engineering, etc. Regarding foreign policy, he stated that the Marshall Aid to Europe Plan is the main factor of the Heavenly Kingdom's foreign policy. He emphasized that "We are taking perfect and concrete approaches to realize our determination to complete peace. We are fighting hard to overcome famine and suffering in order to achieve peace.</p>
<p>We are seeking to establish a world where all countries, large and small, can survive freely without fear of aggression. We are striving for the coordination of all nationalities in the world, based on individual dignity and human mutual love."</p>
<h3>Stating the Aid to Europe Plan Which Involved the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>When referring to the Marshall Plan, Truman indirectly referred to the Soviet Union and its neighbors, but did not directly name them. He said: "Unfortunately, not all governments in the world share the hopes of the American people to achieve economic recovery in many parts of the world through international cooperation, although we should still do our best to overcome economic paralysis." Other points in Truman's message include the issue of racial discrimination in the United States, which he believes is inconsistent with American traditions. He will submit a special project later to deal with this matter. In addition, he also advocated making Hawaii and Alaska two states of the United States. Regarding industry, he said that in the next few years, the industrial sector should invest at least 30 billion yuan to develop production.</p>
<h3>Regarding Labor Proposed Increasing Wages</h3>
<p>Regarding labor, he proposed raising the current minimum wage from 45 cents to 75 cents per hour.</p>
<h3>Basic Materials for Aid to Europe Provided to Congress for Reference</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 7th] A set of material reports was released here today, showing that under the proposed European Recovery Plan, many of the needs of the sixteen countries participating in the recovery are difficult to implement for a while. These reports were prepared for the reference of Congress and provide a detailed analysis of the figures for basic materials and the situation of world supply put forward by the Paris Conference last year. The preface to the report points out that there is a severe shortage of many basic materials, and it is impossible to fully meet the estimated needs of the participating countries in the first few years of the implementation of the recovery plan.</p>
<h3>Total Aid to Europe Canceled Greatly Increased Hope for Passage Vandenberg Says Possibility Increases Fivefold</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Regarding foreign aid, after President Truman decided to withdraw the amount of 17 billion US dollars in the Marshall Plan, the hope that the European Recovery Act can be passed by Congress has greatly increased. Senate Speaker Vandenberg said: He believes that Mr. Truman's action can increase the possibility of passing the aid to Europe plan by five times.</p>
<h3>All of Finland's Debts The US Plans to Cancel</h3>

<h3>British Cabinet Continues Meeting Today Thoroughly Reviews Diplomatic Policy It Is Said that Britain Will Increase Troops to Greece</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 6th] The British Cabinet met today to review the domestic economy for the new year, which was the first meeting since the Christmas holiday. The Cabinet is scheduled to meet again on the 8th to review foreign policy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] The entire issue of British foreign policy will be thoroughly reviewed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting based on the memorandum submitted by Bevin. In view of the recent international situation, it is necessary to formulate a new policy. All resolutions in this cabinet meeting will be announced by Bevin in the House of Commons during the debate on foreign affairs after Congress reconvenes on the 21st. Some observers believe that Aedili's broadcast speech on Bait Ri is a preliminary sign of adopting a tougher policy towards the Soviet Union, and it is also the toughest attack on the Soviet Union since the Labor government came to power. At the same time, it was also heard that the British government has "secretly" notified the three countries of South Hungary and the Soviet Union that if each country recognizes the rebel government of Greece, London will regard it as a threat to international peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 6th, Associated Press] Well-informed sources said: After the revision of British foreign policy, it may be decided to increase British troops stationed in Greece. London attaches great importance to the report that the Greek rebels have shelled the Greek government forces from Albanian territory.

<h3>The Far East Committee Has Decided The Annual Steel Production of Japan is 5.5 Million Tons</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 7th: Washington News, it is reported that the Far East Committee has decided to allow Japan to produce 5.5 million tons of steel annually after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. This production volume is approximately equal to Japan's production volume between 1933 and 1935. The Economic Committee of the Far East Committee has unanimously agreed that Japan's pig iron production should be set at 2 million tons per year, and cast iron should be set at 3.5 million tons per year.</p>
<p>In 1933-35, Japan produced 2,384,000 tons of pig iron and 3,265,000 tons of cast iron annually, totaling 5,649,000 tons. At the same time, the Far East Committee is also trying to determine Japan's merchant ship tonnage. Well-informed sources said that the Economic Committee's passage of Japan's steel production volume is equivalent to the passage of the Far East Committee's plenary session, because all major countries are represented in the Economic Committee. The Economic Committee has also reached decisions on Japan's aluminum industry and other industries' production, but is unwilling to disclose them, because when passing these decisions, some countries abstained, so the vote in the plenary session may change. Regarding Japan's merchant ship tonnage, it is generally agreed that ships sailing along the Japanese mainland should be about 1 to 1.5 million tons, but opinions on the tonnage of seagoing ships are extremely inconsistent.</p>

"We want Japan to support a democratic force, the strength and determination of this force is enough to support itself, and it can resist another totalitarian country's war threat that may occur in the Far East in the future." Royall's statement reinforces the impression that Japan has gradually become a strategic fortress for the United States' defense in the Far East.</p>

A letter was sent to the municipal government stating that the number of newspapers in Shanghai has reached a saturation point, and applications for publication or resumption of publication will be suspended for one year.</p>
<h3>Calling Newspaper Leaders to Discuss Saving Paper</h3>
<p>Regarding paper saving, the municipal government recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan. The regulations on saving paper for newspapers, magazines, and books are as follows: Newspapers in various places should strive to save space in the arrangement of news and advertisements. Those that were originally more than one sheet should automatically reduce to one sheet after the promulgation of these measures. Those that were originally more than two sheets should not exceed two sheets, and those that were originally more than three sheets should not exceed two and a half sheets. The page size of magazines in various places should follow the following regulations: 1. Weekly publications should be limited to 16 pages per issue, 2. Biweekly publications should be limited to 32 pages per issue, 3. Monthly publications and above should be limited to 64 pages per issue. The above page counts are all calculated on one side, and the cover can be added with another four pages. Newspapers, magazines, and books should use domestic paper as much as possible. The Ministry of Interior may adjust the quantity of newspapers and magazines in various places according to the needs of the matter, in order to achieve a balanced cultural development in the midst of saving. Newspapers and magazines without sufficient funds and fixed addresses should be strictly restricted from registration.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, the discussion was very thorough at the meeting. Speaker Pan suggested that newspapers should be based on one sheet in principle, and those with more than one sheet should reduce the ratio. Li Zikuan expressed his approval in principle, but all Chinese and foreign newspapers must be restricted equally. As a result, it was decided that the Social Affairs Bureau would call newspaper leaders to discuss and then submit it to the Ministry of Interior.</p>

<p>Kao Chi-min's Retrial Concludes</p>

<h3>Flourishing Domestic Film Industry: Studios Compete for Stars, Talent Sought, Many New Studios Still Planned This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The film industry in this city experienced extraordinary growth last year. In addition to the state-run "China Film Studio," the private "China Electric," "Kunlun," "Wen Hua," "Cathay," and "Shanghai Real" all established studios in Shanghai. However, due to the failure to obtain official exchange rates for film imports, with most supplies coming from Kodak on a piecemeal basis, the total output was less than one-fifth of pre-war levels. However, this also led to a more rigorous production attitude, with almost all themes drawn from the people, fully reflecting reality, which was the most valuable achievement of the entire film art last year. Among them, Kunlun's "The Spring River Flows East" was welcomed and sold out in over 800 screenings last year, breaking the pre-war sales records of "Song of the Fishermen" (84 days) and "Sisters' Flowers" (60 days). Secondly, "China Film Studio's" documentary "China's Resistance Against Japan" was also warmly welcomed by the people in various places. Due to the limitations of material resources and the simplicity of all equipment, it is still difficult for production techniques to compete with Western films, so the market in Southeast Asia has not yet been fully expanded. In terms of actors, very few new talents have been promoted, and the "stars" with some reputation have become the object of competition among the studios, with some even offering huge "recruiting fees" to attract them. It is expected that many people will continue to plan new studios starting this year, and the need for talent is becoming increasingly urgent. It is expected that training new actors will be the top priority for the film industry this year.</p>
<h3>A Child's Toy Causes a Great Disaster: Explosion of Raw Materials for "Throwing Firecrackers" Kills Shop Owner, Injures Four</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Jinxing Firecracker Workshop, located at No. 85 Caopeng, Huachang Road, at the end of Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei, had just opened for four days when, unexpectedly, at about 10:10 last night, while manufacturing "throwing firecrackers," the raw materials for the explosives suddenly exploded.

<h3>Shanghai-Xunyang, Shanghai-Hankou Distance-Based Pricing: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Says It's Difficult</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation previously forwarded a suggestion from the Ministry of Finance to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies to calculate the freight rates for the Shanghai-Xunyang and Shanghai-Hankou sections based on the distance traveled. According to the person in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it seems inappropriate to make changes to this matter, and three reasons are stated: 1. Freight transportation is very scarce between Xunyang and Hankou. If the Shanghai-Xunyang and Shanghai-Hankou sections are calculated separately, it will not be possible to compensate for the loss of empty tonnage in shipping. 2. The distance between Jiujiang and Hankou on the Yangtze River route is very short, and both passengers and cargo use Hankou as a distribution center, so Jiujiang is not a major port of call, but a mere bay port. 3. According to shipping practice, the freight rate for the Shanghai-Hankou section is calculated based on the Shanghai-Hankou section, which implies the intention of subsidizing it. The above three points have been formally submitted to the Ministry by the National Shipping Federation and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Additional Sailings on Shanghai-Chongming Route Starting Today</h3>

<h3>Commemoration of Martyr Ping Zuren on His Sixth Death Anniversary Today</h3>

<h3>Zhu Boquan Released from Prison after Posting 200 Million Yuan Bail</h3>

<h3>Express Mail and Registered Mail, etc. Planned to Be Received by Machines</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The postal authorities in this city are planning to use machines to receive express mail and registered mail that require receipts to save time. The principle of this type of machine is the same as the cash registers used in some stores. When a letter is inserted, a receipt card will pop out immediately. The post office is currently working on design drawings, but it will take a long time to realize because it needs to be customized in the United States.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Distributing Propaganda</h3>
<p>The Post Office Has No Right to Inspect [Our Report] Recently, many Communist Party propaganda materials have been found in this city, all delivered by mail in the form of letters. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the post office to inquire about whether there were any methods to prevent this. According to him, the post office has no right to open any sealed letters due to postal regulations, otherwise, it would be illegal. The mail inspection system implemented during the war was carried out by military and political organs sending personnel to reside in the bureau for inspection, not by the post office itself. The responsibility of the post office is only to accurately deliver the mail sent by the sender to the recipient, so the post office itself is unable to prevent the Communist Party from using the post office to send out propaganda materials.</p>

Both buyers and sellers will be sent to the court for investigation. 3. Election campaigns should use reasonable methods such as speeches and propaganda to express political views and win over voters. The Municipal Party Headquarters will provide as much convenience as possible to anyone who needs assistance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants Detained for Purchasing Grain: Mayor of Nanjing Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Part of the Source Under Investigation Has Been Released [Our Report from Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the detention of Shanghai grain merchants in Nanjing for purchasing grain, Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi issued a statement on the evening of the 7th, stating that the purpose of the Nanjing authorities in detaining and inspecting the grain purchased by Shanghai grain merchants was to clarify the source of the grain. If it comes from Anhui Province, the Nanjing authorities will release it. If it is purchased in Nanjing City, it will be detained because it is related to the grain supply in Nanjing City.

<h3>Taiwan Industry and Mining Delegation Held a Dinner Party Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Taiwan Industry and Mining Delegation returned to Shanghai, they held a dinner party last night to entertain relevant people from all walks of life. Director Wu Kaixian, Chairman Wu Yunfu of the Industrial Association, and others attended. During the dinner, Xie Tiansha, the general manager of the delegation, delivered a speech detailing his impressions of the tour of Taiwan. Director Wu also gave a speech from the perspective of a "travel companion." The party ended happily at 9:00. According to a member of the delegation, Taiwanese people have become accustomed to using fertilizer in agricultural cultivation. Currently, there is only one fertilizer manufacturing plant in Taiwan Province, and the supply of products cannot meet the demand. Soybean cakes from Northeast China were once sold to Taiwan and were very popular, but the supply has been cut off due to military relations. Therefore, if a fertilizer plant could be established in Taiwan at this time, it would have great potential for development.</p>

All additional charges will be increased accordingly. The increase rate and the date of implementation will be subject to final approval by the Ministry of Transportation. 2. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation went to the United States on official business to participate in negotiations on aid to China. The shipping industry believes that its responsibility is not only to develop in industry, commerce, and transportation, but also to play an important role in national defense construction. Therefore, it was specifically resolved to request Minister Yu to purchase materials and order new ships for the shipping industry during his visit to the United States to expand the shipping industry. At the same time, various shipping companies will prepare important information for Yu to use as a reference.</p>

<h3>Huainan Mining and Railway Company Files Lawsuit Over Purchase of Railroad Ties</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Liu Wenxun, the general manager of the Huainan Mining and Railway Company, recently filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Englishman Schneideron and Chinese citizens Qian Yujin and Lu Xiangyi of fraud. Schneideron and others engaged in import and export business. In February of last year, Liu needed to purchase railroad ties, and the defendants claimed to have 300,000 railroad ties produced in South America, valued at US$2.58 each, for a total value of US$774,000, and showed a sample of the railroad ties. At that time, the Huainan Mining and Railway Company paid a deposit, stating that the goods would be delivered in three months, guaranteed by a letter of credit from the Bank of China. In April of last year, the defendants told Liu that the freight had increased, and each tie should be increased to US$2.94. In September, more than 16,450 railroad ties were shipped, but they did not match the previous samples, and the wood had already rotted. After being appraised by the British Paulison Trading Company, it was confirmed that the wood had rotted and was unusable. The Huainan Mining and Railway Company demanded that the defendants return the deposit and compensation for losses, but to no avail. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit accusing them of fraud and demanding compensation for the plaintiff's losses of US$985,158.50.</p>

<h3>Praising the Mayor's Great Spirit</h3>
<p>Following that, Wang Xianqing, Yan Huiqing, Zhao Zukang, Yan Zhuang, and others successively delivered speeches, unanimously praising Mayor Wu for his consideration of the disaster-stricken people and his great spirit of service. Dr. Yan also said that it is a shame for the people of Shanghai that our compatriots live in places where even cattle and horses cannot live. After the winter relief work is launched, it will surely make the disaster-stricken people grateful.</p>
<p>After taking photos, the groundbreaking ceremony began in the music. Wu Guozhen, Yan Huiqing, Fang Zhi, Yan Zhuang, and Zhao Zukang each held a hoe and shovel. In an instant, hoes and shovels danced in unison, and the sound of "Hangyu" rose everywhere. The wind was cold and the soil was dry, making it difficult to break the ground. However, Dr. Yan, with his head full of white hair, used all his strength to insert the iron shovel into the mud, and then assisted it with his feet, and the soil began to loosen. At this time, Mayor Wu was also exhausted and out of breath, and he called out "I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore." Then he was the first to let go, and the groundbreaking ceremony was completed in the cheers and applause of the crowd. Five holes were dug in the vast square. Construction will begin today and will be completed in three months, and hundreds of righteous houses will be completed.</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Again Petitions for Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>Although representatives of grain merchants from all over the country have petitioned in Beijing four times for the continued exemption of the grain industry from business tax, since the business tax was transferred to local governments for collection in July of the 35th year of the Republic, local governments are still studying whether to exempt the tax for the sake of prudent handling and have not yet made a decision. The Rice Business Association of this city believes that the food issue is the most serious among the current people's livelihood problems. Once the business tax is levied, it will inevitably affect the rice price and stimulate price increases. Therefore, it convened a meeting of 250 representatives of its 2,400 rice shops more than ten days ago to discuss the issue of petitioning for exemption from business tax and the tax calculation standard for the first category of profit-seeking enterprises. Regarding the exemption from business tax, in addition to resolving to invoke the fourth item of tax-exempt businesses listed in Article 2 of the amended Business Tax Law and requesting the authorities to issue a clear order allowing exemption, the association has also submitted a request to the Municipal Council, requesting the Municipal Government to discuss the case within one week of the municipal administration meeting, striving for a quick passage of the exemption, and requesting the Municipal Government to jointly submit to the central government and telegrams to all provinces and cities to exempt the tax in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<h3>Railway Workers Tense, Year-End Bonus Negotiations Continue Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Pan Bingqing, Wang Cheng, Gao Qifu, and five others from the Two-Way General Labor Union negotiated with Director Chen Bozhuang on the issue of year-end bonuses and the union's request for adjustments to housing subsidies and the issuance of uniforms. The bureau has agreed to give a one-month year-end bonus, while the union is demanding one and a half months. Director Chen said that the bureau's finances are tight and it is difficult to accept the housing subsidy and uniform requests. Railway workers are paying close attention to the negotiations between the representatives and the director. Yesterday afternoon, a large number of workers were waiting for news in the locomotive room and other places, and their emotions were tense. Their only reason is that passenger and freight costs have increased by 70% to 100%, while employee benefits remain the same, which is unreasonable. The issue was not resolved by night and negotiations will continue today.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Seizes Smuggled Goods, No Longer Sold in this City: Eradicating the Source of Luxury Goods</h3>
<p>In order to promote frugality and eradicate luxury goods, the municipal authorities, after deliberation by the Economic Conference, decided that the Municipal Government should suggest to the central government that Jianghai Customs be ordered not to auction seized smuggled luxury goods, etc., but to transfer them to Hong Kong for auction. The cosmetics, etc., among the surplus materials of the US military sold by the Materials Supply Bureau should also no longer be supplied, cutting off the source of foreign luxury goods and achieving the goal of thoroughly banning the sale of luxury goods. At the same time, Jianghai Customs has also submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, stating that seized smuggled goods will not be auctioned in this city.</p>
<h3>Ships Sailing on the Beiyang Line Prepare to Call at Weihaiwei</h3>
<p>Since its restoration, Weihaiwei City has not had its port repaired, so major shipping companies operating on the Beiyang Line from this city do not call at Weihaiwei. Recently, the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau received a letter from Mayor Long of Weihaiwei, stating that Weihaiwei Port has been repaired and completed, and hoping that ships operating on the Beiyang Line will call at Weihaiwei to facilitate the boarding and alighting of passengers and goods. It is learned that the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau has expressed its support for the above request and has instructed major shipping companies in this city to pay attention to and add voyages to Weihaiwei.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Personnel Director Wu Jie Accused of Accepting Bribes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wu Jie, the director of the Personnel Office of the Police Bureau, was previously accused by a person named Yu that Wu had used his authority to accept bribes and manipulate personnel promotions and demotions. The Supreme Court Procuratorate ordered the Shanghai High Procuratorate to transfer the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Ding Tongjun, the prosecutor in charge of the case, summoned the defendant for questioning on the 5th of this month and summoned Liu Shaokui, the section chief of the First Section of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Bureau, senior officials Chen Chunxi, Wang Roubang, Wu Yongfa, and Yang Feizhang to testify. According to Wu, the promotion or demotion of officers in each branch bureau is reported by the branch bureau chiefs, and the Personnel Office submits it to the bureau chief for approval based on this report, so he himself has no power to manipulate promotions and demotions. He presented a performance evaluation form in court as proof. Witness Liu Shaokui and others also testified that the complainant accused each official of sending bribes of no less than 10 million yuan for promotion, but in reality, a promotion would only increase the salary by more than 100,000 yuan, which is impossible. After the questioning, they were ordered to return, pending further investigation.</p>

Unexpectedly, as soon as they went upstairs, they heard shouts of "Hit them!" Shen realized something was wrong and hurriedly went downstairs. However, more than a dozen thugs were waiting. With a shout to attack, Shen Xiangxing and his friends were seized and beaten. Shen suffered severe head and back injuries from stabs with sharp weapons. The Songshan Police Station was notified and dispatched a large number of officers to suppress the violence. The assailants had scattered, but suspect Zhu A'liu was apprehended.

<h3>Two Fronts: Electoral Scene in Changhua, Western Zhejiang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Changhua] The first lesson in elections has generated a unique interest among the 45,000 voters in Changhua, western Zhejiang. This is not because all voters understand their electoral rights, but because of the heated competition among candidates. For months, a thick electoral atmosphere has enveloped every village corner. "What Wang Xuequan is doing, what Chen Yi is doing..." has become a common topic during tea breaks.</p>
<p>Colorful Propaganda Slogans</p>
<p>Colorful propaganda slogans, joint endorsements of so-and-so, small printed leaflets, and temporary mimeographed publications such as "Election News" and "Democracy," mostly contain opinions on the election. However, due to differences in stance, there are mutual attacks and insults. You paste, I tear; you tear, I paste again, fully demonstrating a "fearless spirit" and a "relentless killing power."</p>
<p>Delayed Distribution of Voter Certificates</p>
<p>According to the Election and Recall Law, voter certificates should be issued to voters 20 days before the election. However, this was not the case in Changhua. The Election Office issued them only three days before the election. Some voters in remote areas did not receive their voter certificates by the time the election started. Some say that the election of National Assembly representatives has already been postponed for a month; otherwise, it would have become even more of a joke.</p>
<p>Many Certificates Without County Seals</p>
<p>Whether due to the negligence of election officials or other reasons, many voter certificates issued to voters were not stamped with the county seal. Many certificates also had different numbers than those on the voter registry. Furthermore, some people received two or more voter certificates with the same name and number. The first two situations resulted in the cancellation of voting rights, while the latter added an extra vote.</p>
<p>Pleasing Titles Unknown Beforehand</p>
<p>Some voter certificates were stamped with wooden stamps reading "Participating in Women's Elections" and "Participating in Farmers' Association Elections." Who were members of the Women's Association and who were members of the Farmers' Association? They themselves did not know they had such beautiful and pleasing titles beforehand. However, they did not appreciate it and accused the Women's Association and the Social Affairs Section of arbitrarily creating membership lists, believing it was equivalent to "raping public opinion." Coincidentally, many of these so-called members were voters favorable to candidate Wang Xuequan.</p>
<p>Active Campaigns by Wang and Chen</p>
<p>There are a total of seven candidates, but only Wang Xuequan and Chen Yi are actively campaigning. Therefore, the main activity is focused on Wang and Chen.</p>
<p>Mysterious Management of 19 Ballot Boxes</p>
<p>Each of the county's 19 ballot boxes is managed and supervised by seven people. In addition to personnel from the Party headquarters, the county government, and township offices, many are employees of the Zhejiang Provincial Grain and Food Administration (candidate Chen Yi is currently the director). Truly fair and impartial local gentry are not qualified to be hired. This mysterious personnel arrangement has led everyone to harbor an unresolved mystery about the Election Office.</p>
<p>Generous Act: 30,000 for One Vote</p>
<p>It seems very difficult to win a vote. Thus, news spread in the villages: "30,000 yuan per vote, 20,000 yuan per vote, scribes receive 2,000 yuan per vote..." In today's extremely depleted rural economy, someone generously gives money, benefiting the public. A benevolent act! A benevolent act!</p>
<p>Vote For Me Or Face Conscription</p>
<p>"If you don't vote for so-and-so, you'll be conscripted. If you don't vote for so-and-so, you'll..." This poses a great threat to the gullible and kind people, and public opinion has been emasculated.</p>
<p>I'll Grind Ink For You For My Brother's Sake</p>
<p>Election regulations stipulate that no one can monitor the area where votes are cast. However, there are exceptions. Chen Liang, the head of Yukuan Township and the elder brother of candidate Chen Yi, serves as a ballot inspector at the 12th polling station in the township. He goes to great lengths to grind ink for you, hand you a pen... and only relaxes after you have written "Chen Yi" correctly. Who can say he is not following the rules? Who can say he lacks a spirit of service?</p>
<p>Ballot Boxes Moved and Sealed Early</p>
<p>Regulations stipulate that ballot boxes cannot be moved for three days during the election. However, some ballot boxes were miraculously moved from Village A to Village B. The election was originally scheduled to end at a certain time, but some ballot boxes were sealed before the deadline. Thus, many voters helplessly gave up their votes.</p>
<p>Passionate Hometown Students Roar in Frustration</p>
<p>College students and those working in various agencies and organizations from Changhua along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line returned to their hometowns in droves to volunteer for the election. They are all passionate and righteous young people. They demand that County Magistrate Wu firmly uphold a fair stance, uphold justice, and that local leaders jointly establish a solid democratic foundation and foster a good electoral atmosphere. However, reality has greatly disappointed them, so they are frustrated and roar! However, you can be frustrated and you can roar, but those in power adopt the attitude of "Let people laugh and scold, I'll do what I want." They ignore your frustration and don't hear your roaring!</p>
<p>Two Fronts, One Conclusion</p>
<p>Due to the fierce competition between Wang and Chen, Changhua has clearly formed two fronts. Before it is announced who is elected, there is already such criticism: "One side is glorious even in defeat, the other side is defeated even in victory." (Special Correspondent Fang Zheng)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Dispatch, 6th] Several wooden boats from Taierzhuang, loaded with coal and arrowhead, passed through Guazhou yesterday and were sailing to the Jiaoshan area in the river. Due to the rough waves, three boats unfamiliar with the terrain were unfortunately overturned by the waves. Neighboring boats, upon hearing the news, rescued the boatmen who had fallen into the water from two boats. However, all five people on the other boat drowned.

<h3>Students of the Municipal Teachers College Petitioned the Bureau of Education Yesterday: The Resumption of Classes Has Not Been Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Students of the Municipal Teachers College in this city have been on strike for several days, demanding reasonable treatment. After sending representatives to petition the Bureau of Education yesterday, the issue remains unresolved. The student union has decided to convene a general meeting today to decide whether to resume classes. Director Li of the Bureau of Education met with Xie Engao, the director of secondary education of the bureau, yesterday afternoon to talk to the student representatives and urged them to resume classes immediately. The representatives explained in detail the reasons for the strike and made two demands: The school should reissue the balance of public funds increased by the bureau's order in October, November, and December of last year; They should receive the same treatment as students of national teachers colleges; The salaries of the school's cooks should be paid from the school's regular expenses, but the school has misappropriated funds from the quota for publicly funded students, occupying the quota of up to 30 publicly funded students. A thorough investigation is requested. Li and Xie listened to the representatives and replied point by point: The school reported that it had already exhausted the funds to be reissued, and now the bureau has decided to send personnel to check the food accounts for the two months together with the students; The Bureau of Education and the Municipal Government cannot be responsible, and the Executive Yuan has been requested to approve it; It is wrong for the school to use student public funds to pay the salaries of the cooks and a thorough investigation will be conducted. In addition, the student representatives requested that the public funds for this month be overdrafted immediately so that they can start meals because there is no funding for meals at present. Director Li agreed to discuss it with the school and issue it all before the 10th of this month. The students finally stated that according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, teachers college students should be exempt from all fees except for the student union membership fee, but each student at the school is required to pay 560,000 yuan in tuition fees this semester, which is higher than the tuition fees paid by teachers college students across the country.

<h3>Li Huitang Caused a Sensation in Kunming (Continued Conclusion) Talking About Participating in the World Games Football Preliminary Round</h3>
<p>Talking About Participating in the World Games</p>
<p>Li Huitang was very busy in Kunming with games and social events. The reporter seized an opportunity to have a long conversation with him. He said, "Regarding participation in next year's World Games, China is probably still going to participate in a 'tourist' capacity. This isn't meant to be discouraging, but it's the truth!" Then he talked specifically about the situation in Chinese football. It's undeniable that China has too few true sports talents. The eight years of the War of Resistance had a great impact.</p>
<p>The "King of Football" talked about his previous participation in the World Games, the situation of facing the British football team, and the experience of traveling to nine countries. It truly evoked a sense of vicissitudes. Seeing that the World Games were about to be held again next year, Dr. Rong Qizhao was appointed as the football team leader, and Li Huitang, Yu Hengzhi, Zhou Jiaqi, Huang Jiajun and other five people were appointed as football player selection committee members. This work is scheduled to be completed in February of the 37th year. After that, they will need to concentrate on training in Hong Kong, and at the latest, they hope to depart from the country in mid-April. This time, they plan to change the route, not passing through the Nanyang Islands, but through the Philippines, New Zealand, and various places in South America, because they can take this opportunity to practice and observe, to learn from. The proceeds from the ticket sales of matches along the way will supplement.</p>
<h3>Selection of Representatives</h3>
<p>Regarding the selection of players, Li's personal opinion is that the Shanghai team will have a maximum of five people selected, and the Malayan team may have four selected. The majority of the players will still be located in Hong Kong. The football team may select eighteen to twenty people. The selection criteria this time will be relatively strict, and they are willing to select more young "newcomers" and are unwilling to let "old players" monopolize this team. This opinion is very valuable.</p>
<p>Finally, he mentioned that it would be best for the Chinese football team to have a special plane for this trip abroad, to save time and preserve the players' physical strength. They do not plan to go by sea again. Currently, they are negotiating with the China National Aviation Corporation, and there are not many problems. The company also expressed its willingness to help. The second issue is the team members' food. It is necessary to plan in advance because the British "rationing system" is strictly enforced. Each person only gets one egg and one quart of butter per week. If that is the case, the "King of Football" said with a smile, "then the Chinese players will not be able to play." Therefore, within the possible range, they plan to transport more white rice and store more vegetables to avoid not being able to find anything to eat at the last minute.</p>
<p>He believes that the national team's score in this World Games is likely to be very low. As long as football can maintain its past glory, it will be as desired. According to the current results of other sports, Lou Wen'ao's 10,000-meter race may rank fifth, assuming there are no new changes in the world rankings.</p>
<p>We talked too much, and the reporter excused himself from his tightly grasped hand. (Our correspondent in Kunming, Xu Jilian)</p>

<h3>Cotton Commercial Association Hosts Various Sectors, States Eight Wishes of Cotton Merchants, Joint Meeting of Various Parties Related to Cotton Yarn and Cloth to be Held</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Municipal Cotton Commercial Association hosted various sectors yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM on the sixth floor of the China Merchants Bureau regarding the "National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Measures" passed by the Executive Yuan at its meeting on December 23rd of last year. About a hundred people attended, including Pan Gongqing, Yang Guanbei, Yan Esheng, Pan Shihao, Ma Junshuo, Wang Qiyu, Shi Fengxiang, Liu Piji, and directors, supervisors, and members of the association. The atmosphere at the meeting was particularly激昂. Finally, the leaders of all parties related to cotton yarn and cloth advocated for the regular convening of a joint conversation meeting so that, within the scope of legitimate steps to fight for the survival of the industry, they could jointly draft appropriate opinions and contribute them to the relevant government authorities for adoption and implementation. The meeting was adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The main points of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants Should Not Lose Their Jobs, Existing Cotton Should Be Purchased at a Reasonable Price</p>
<p>First, Liu 　Sun, Chairman of the Association, and Zheng Zhecheng, Executive Director, delivered speeches respectively, stating the eight wishes of cotton merchants after the unified purchase of raw cotton, as follows: According to the interpretation of Article 15 of the Constitution, the cotton yarn and cloth management measures have clearly restricted the working rights of cotton merchants. Also, according to Article 172 of the Constitution, "Orders that conflict with the Constitution are invalid." The implementation of the unified purchase order deserves attention. Cotton merchants are distributors, and according to Section 3 of Section 2 of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Measures, "The cotton collected by cotton merchants in cotton-producing areas shall be sold entirely to the cotton collection agencies of the association at the prices stipulated by the association." It is recognized that cotton merchants have the right to collect cotton in the producing areas, and it is not permissible to change the order through discussions. Furthermore, since there is currently a need for urgent purchase, in addition to entrusting the Textile Construction Company, why not simultaneously accommodate cotton merchants to participate in the urgent purchase? Cotton merchants have a long history, with firms and branches established in cotton-producing areas across the country, specializing in raw material procurement and transportation. Cotton merchants have made contributions to the country during wartime and after the restoration, and they have suffered huge losses. They have the right to demand that the state guarantee their survival. The cotton collection branches of the Textile Construction Company in various places are mostly located in larger distribution markets in cities, and their cotton sources are supplied by cotton merchants. Cotton merchants specialize in operations and are fully responsible, which is better than entrusting them to purchase on their behalf. Since the authorities decided to unify the purchase of raw cotton, the cotton merchants' existing cotton could not be sold, resulting in even greater losses. The cotton merchants' current businesses are completely shut down, and their costs are exhausted. Delaying too long will make it impossible to salvage the situation. Cotton merchants request three points: (A) "Legitimate cotton merchants must not be made unemployed." (B) The existing cotton of cotton merchants should be purchased immediately with funds at a reasonable price. (C) Cotton merchants should be allowed to collect and transport the cotton needed by the yarn factories not designated for spinning by the Yarn Management Committee.</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Supports Two Principles: Guaranteeing Employment and Assisting Production</p>
<p>Chairman Pan of the Municipal Council said briefly: It is rumored that the Yarn Management Committee will temporarily entrust the Textile Construction Company to purchase cotton on its behalf. I hope this is just a rumor. If it is true, then from the current standpoint of suppressing bandits and economic suppression, I will oppose it. The communists are causing chaos and destruction everywhere, while the government aims to actively promote construction and production. In this situation, as long as cotton merchants can sell the collected cotton to the unified collection agency at the stipulated price, the Yarn Management Committee has no reason to reject the livelihood of cotton merchants, allowing the originally skilled cotton collectors to become unemployed and increasing social instability. The most important thing now is to guarantee people's employment and to assist national production. All "suspension" laws that violate one of these two principles will ultimately be impossible to implement. Now that the country has implemented the Constitution, I deeply believe that the industrial and commercial sectors will sincerely support reasonable policies. Otherwise, they should appeal and provide legitimate demands, suggesting that the authorities adopt them. I think that the responsible authorities should also consider adopting them.</p>
<p>Yang Guanbei, Executive Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Pan Shihao, Chairman of the Association of Reproduction Industries, Yan Esheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Six Districts, Shi Fengxiang, Director, and Liu Piji were all invited to deliver speeches separately, expressing their sympathy for the plight of the cotton merchants.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, buying interest in public bonds continued to expand amidst the currency system issue. The Unified C opened at 39,000 yuan, rising to 49,000 yuan, and then rebounding.

<p>Yesterday afternoon, foreign stocks began to rise. Speculation on foreign exchange arose again, and the black market fueled buying interest. Popular stocks consistently reached new highs. Yisha started at 450,000 yuan and gradually rose to close at 515,000 yuan. Small banks provided supply, while securities brokers from the Guangdong and Jiangsu regions were buyers. As a result, compared to the previous close, reclamation was flat, shipping rose by 15%, trams rose by 5%, and the remaining stocks all rose by about 10%.</p>
<p>Imports of Rice, Cotton, Flour, Coal, etc. Will No Longer Be Settled at the Official Exchange Rate</p>
<p>[Our report] Regarding the settlement of foreign exchange for imports of American cotton, rice, wheat flour, coking coal, etc., the Business Bureau of the Central Bank notified all designated banks on January 5th that, starting this month, the above-mentioned materials should be settled at the market price of the Stabilization Fund. The original text of the notice stated: "Having received an order from the Executive Yuan, effective from this month, all foreign exchange for imported cotton, rice, wheat flour, and coking coal with import permits shall be converted at the market price of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, and may no longer be converted at the official price. Section 5 (A) of the previous circular is hereby revoked." All designated banks have complied with the order.</p>
<p>Food Prices Generally Rise, Oil Market Cannot Meet Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 15,200 shih of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. Internal land saw a resurgence, people's minds were agitated, and prices rose, with all goods experiencing a comprehensive rise. Japonica rice and Yuan rice both rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, slightly slackening near the close. Flour rose endlessly, rising linearly, continuing to surge by 20,000 yuan.

Dahuang rebounded by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and guest beans increased sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mung beans are being purchased by North China, with demand exceeding supply. Scarcity makes it precious, flying up by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Red beans, with retail conversion, surged by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Soybeans followed suit, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Corn was being purchased smoothly by North China, recovering from fatigue and rebounding by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

<h3>Yarn Management Committee Adjusts Negotiated Prices Again, Cotton Yarn Soars</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Yarn Management Committee was approved yesterday to adjust the negotiated price of cotton yarn. 20-count yarn was re-listed at 33 million yuan, an increase of 11.8% compared to the previous level. The prices of other counts of yarn were adjusted proportionally.</p>
<p>The committee continued to sell yarn in the cotton yarn market yesterday, selling a total of 1,227 pieces, equivalent to 1,718 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 161 applicants applied. The selling price of 20-count yarn ranged from 34.5 million yuan for Ruyi, Red Bee, and Golden Yuanbao brands to 36.1 million yuan for Golden Chicken brand. 6-count vice-sunlight yarn was 17 million yuan. 32-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 47.1 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight yarn was 52.8 million yuan, and 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix yarn was 59.8 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was characterized by the Textile Construction Company's yarn sales and the increase in allocation prices, which boosted people's spirits. Local reproduction manufacturers absorbed vigorously, and buyers from other regions were still eager. Owners took the opportunity to hold on and were unwilling to let go easily, and the market showed a state of demand exceeding supply. The asking price soared. The highest price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn broke through the 60 million yuan mark, reaching 60.2 million yuan. By the close, due to some floating profits being realized, the price fell back to close at 60 million yuan, an increase of 2.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, all other counts of coarse and fine yarn also followed, rising by 800,000 to 1.2 million to 3 million or more yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth is Firm</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened with a lively atmosphere in the morning. Although the Textile Construction Company had a large supply, the increase in the allocation price of yarn caused people to suddenly report firmness. Local merchants absorbed, and colleagues replenished at low prices. Furthermore, merchants from Hankou brought cash to Shanghai to purchase, and merchants from the North and Guangxi regions especially absorbed. The prices of all cloth stores created unprecedented highs. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at 1.515 million to 545,000 yuan on the open market, and it was difficult to collect. It was also quoted as high as 1.6 million yuan, an increase of about 90,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 5-inch Blue Chicken Zhenzhong and other fine cloth also rose by 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 yuan. All other cloths also rose across the board.</p>
<h3>Silk Rises All the Way</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market showed its brilliance again. 120-count Asahi brand shiny silk opened in the morning as high as 102 million yuan, and buying interest did not wane. It rose step by step. By the close of the morning session, the spot price had reached 109 million yuan. It rose further in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 112 million yuan, before falling back to 110 million yuan, an increase of 14 million yuan compared to the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Raw Silk</p>

In the morning, B-grade goods were traded at 101 million yuan, C-grade goods at 99 million yuan, and D-grade goods at 8 million yuan. High-grade goods were offered at 7 million yuan, and trading was quite brisk. In the afternoon, another peak was seen. The price of CD-grade goods was around 104 million yuan, but there were no transactions. Several loads of high-grade goods were offered at 102 million yuan. The route for dried warp silk was relatively slow, and yesterday's market opened 3 to 4 million yuan higher.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was due to the high price of raw materials. Manufacturers have raised factory prices due to cost factors. The Huaqiang true silk quilt covers were still relatively stable in the morning, opening at around 8.5 million yuan, closing at 8.15 million yuan spot, and 8.4 million yuan for next-day delivery. The afternoon showed a high surge, and off-market transactions reached 9.5 million yuan.

Minsheng 45 crepe satin opened at 245,000 yuan, and Huajin crepe feather yarn, etc., were all 5,000 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Market's Buying Interest Boils, Chinese Stocks Advance Rapidly to a Peak</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were buoyant in the morning. Overnight reports stated that food and daily necessities would be settled at market exchange rates, and the black market began to stir. People's minds were like boiling water, and Yong Yarn repeatedly reached new highs. Most of the remaining stocks were limit-up, with extremely good profits.</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session, people's minds were unsettled. Xinyi and Jinglun were again announced to be limit-up. The remaining stocks were just mediocre. Except for Yong Yarn, which debuted at 628 yuan, next-day Yong Yarn even opened lower at 623 yuan. After the opening, next-day Yong Yarn saw 626 yuan, but there were more immediate and next-day deliveries, falling to a low of 612 yuan for both spot and next-day deliveries. Off-market interest rates opened high at 2 jiao 4 and 2 jiao 8 and a half fen, and there was still weakness. Underwear was listed as limit-up, and Yong Yarn rose to 620 yuan, but there were more sellers and a low price of 610 yuan was seen. At this time, speculation about foreign exchange rates arose again, and traders rose to the occasion and pushed up prices. Near noon, the upward momentum strengthened, and Huaxin was pushed to limit-up. At the noon close, Yong Yarn was pulled up to a high price of 637 yuan and 640 yuan. After the close, the asking price was slightly lower. As a result, compared to the previous close, Huaxin, Xinyi, Jinglun, and Underwear stocks for immediate delivery were limit-up, Huafeng and Zhongfa rose by 10%, Shangwu and Datong were flat, Rongfeng was slightly higher, Yonggong was up by half a percent, and the rest were negligibly up or down. Huafeng stocks for next-day delivery rose by 10%, Qinxing slightly declined, Xinguang was flat, and the rest were slightly higher.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, next-day delivery was suspended as usual. Overnight reports stated that food and daily necessities would be settled at market exchange rates, and people's spirits were boosted. Yong Yarn opened and rose to 642 yuan, advancing to 6505 yuan. In addition to Xinyi, Huaxin, and Jinglun being limit-up, Huafeng, Yongye, Zhongfa, Shangwu, Yonggong, Zhongsi, Xinhua Match, Zhongni, Mei Ya, and Shunxu were also listed as limit-up. Although Yong Yarn was sold at 645 yuan, it was still seen advancing further. The stimulation from outside the industry increased greatly. Although the national banks intervened, new high prices of 661 yuan were still created. Due to some profit-taking at high prices, the closing price was 655 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Huaxin, Xinyi, Meiya, Zhongsi, Huafeng, Match, Jinglun, Yonggong, Zhaian, Zhongni, Underwear, Zhongfa, and Yongye stocks were limit-up. Xinhua and Shangwu rose after being limit-up, each rising by more than 10%. Yong Yarn rose slightly, while the rest opened half a percent to 10% higher. The prices of various old stocks in the off-market market rose again across the board.</p>
<p>Freight and Handling Charges Increase Sharply, Taiwan Sugar Raises Allocation Prices</p>

<h3>Reading "Who's Who in America"</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Shanghai will soon have a book similar to "Who's Who in Shanghai" published. Editing such a book is always a thankless task. Either the celebrities in the book accuse it of "not being true to the facts," or readers consider it to be praising and glorifying them. Therefore, we would like to introduce the publication of "Who's Who in America" to those who continue to read, to see how serious and fair they are in editing this magnificent work, and also to learn how they overcome some unexpected difficulties. This will provide some reference and lessons for publishers and editors engaged in "Who's Who."</p>
<p>In the latest issue of "Who's Who," more than 3,500 celebrities are introduced to the American people and even the people of the world. Although there are no medals, rewards, or eulogies, they are honored enough to be listed in this most prestigious book in the world. This honor cannot be bought with money. Many people have tried to bribe to be listed in the celebrity biography, and some have used any means to have their biography recorded in the book, but all have been "rejected" by the rigorous and anonymous editors. When the book was first edited, many celebrities, upon receiving the editor's questionnaire, claimed that unless the publisher gave them a high fee, they would not be willing to fill in their life story in the questionnaire. However, when the editors explained that this book was not for profit and that no wealthy merchant could buy a page in it with money, they quickly filled out the form for the editors.</p>
<p>The yearbook is published every two years. In the past 46 years, 23 issues have been published. They can honestly say that not a single word has been written because of bribery. Assuming that this glorious masterpiece, weighing six and a half pounds, was like other counterfeit "celebrity biographies," casually used by the wealthy to praise and promote them, its publisher could have a million US dollars in revenue in two issues. However, they were not used by money, and their remuneration was less than that of a junior clerk. Only about 30 of the more than 1,000 editorial board members received salaries.</p>
<p>Due to the editors' diligence and rigor, this book is welcomed by readers all over the United States and has a high reputation in various countries. Recently, a senior US government official visited the Turkish cabinet general and this book was prominently placed on his bookshelf. In fact, news agencies, newspapers, government officials, and even the presidential palace in various countries also have this book, because it is a book that truly introduces American celebrities.</p>
<p>The criteria for selecting "celebrities" are very high, and they are selected in two categories: first, those who have special achievements and prestige in their work; and second, those who are important due to their position, such as senior government officials. As for those who are particularly agile in physiology, or major criminals, or celebrities in special positions, are not included in the selection. Therefore, there are no athletes, boxers, or leading figures in circuses in this book, unless they have special fame in other aspects. The editorial board members use all their ingenuity to seek the truth. Errors do exist, such as some people who have bought doctoral degrees with money. Once found out, they are immediately removed from the list and will never be selected again. Each department has a nomination committee, which repeatedly assesses and then sends it to the chief editorial committee for discussion. The members are anonymous, so as not to be influenced by anyone. Due to the importance of the responsibility, once a celebrity who has been selected leaves his position, his name will be removed from the book. The deceased are compiled into a separate obituary column. Roosevelt's biographical questionnaire was sent to the editors a few days before his death, so he has been listed in the obituary column, and his biography will naturally not be included in the next issue of the yearbook.</p>
<p>During the war, the US Army and Navy were greatly expanded, and a number of newly rising generals were increasing every day, and their activities also expanded to all parts of the world. This brought great difficulties to the editing of the yearbook. Their mailing addresses changed three times a day, and their activities were also changing every day, making it impossible for the publishers to catch up with these heroes on the battlefield. For example, the questionnaires returned by General Patton and General Clark, who marched into Germany, were late as usual, because when they were about to mail them, they had to add new activities. Among the questionnaires received, the fastest to be received were those newly selected celebrities. The more famous the people, the simpler the answers. The questionnaires from university presidents or college deans were mostly long essays with pretentious wording. As for government officials, they were even more lengthy and annoying. Of course, the length of the biography in the yearbook does not affect his true importance and fame. Some celebrities with strange tempers simply do not write their life stories to the editorial board members, so the editors have to ask someone close to him to write it, but add a small note in the book page and write a very tactful letter to the celebrity to explain the intention of publishing this yearbook. Some celebrities also asked the editors not to delete the original text of the biography he sent, but due to the need to save pages and not make it too long, they had to explain it tactfully. There are many such special conditions proposed to the editors. Several people claimed that unless a certain time had passed, he could not send back the filled-in biography, because after this time, he might have a son or get married, meaning that he wanted to write his wife and son in his biography. In the yearbook, the truth of age is also a headache, mostly women are the most difficult to deal with, especially female stars and actresses, they will use the same age in several issues, but this is not too important.</p>
<p>Since the first issue of the yearbook was published in 1899, they have collected a lot of valuable celebrity handwriting and photos, and more signatures. According to the editors, in order to maintain the excellent tradition of this great publication for half a century, these valuable things can only be stored, not sold or made public. The editorial department is located in Chicago, they have no retail store, and the selling price of the yearbook is not high, because they are not for the purpose of making money.

<h3>Supplement to the "Chronological Table of Works and Birth and Death Years of Scholars in the Qing Dynasty"</h3>
<p>— Ji Dan</p>
<p>In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I purchased a book compiled by Mr. Xiao Yishan in Beiping, "Chronological Table of Works and Birth and Death Years of Scholars in the Qing Dynasty". The entry for Li Youtang, the author of "Chronicle of Events in the History of Liao and Jin Dynasties", was missing his birth and death dates. I have long wanted to correct it, but the war put an end to it. Mr. Xiao's compilation of this book, together with his "General History of the Qing Dynasty", are both world-renowned works, and republication with revisions is imminent. Now, based on what I know, I will describe Mr. Li's birth, death and place of origin as follows for reference and selection.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's given name was Youtang, and his courtesy name was Feisheng. He was from Pingxiang, Jiangxi. He was born on the 15th day of the second month of the Dingyou year of Daoguang (1837) and died on the 18th day of the seventh month of the Yiyi year of Guangxu (1905). He was a tribute student in the Jiazi year of Tongzhi (1864) and went to the capital in the Yichou year (1865) to take the imperial examination. He was admitted to the Eight Banners Official School as a teaching apprentice and was awarded the title of Instructor. In the Gengyin year of Guangxu (1890), he was selected to be the Instructor of Xiajiang County, and also managed education. In the Guiyi year (1893), he resigned due to his parents' old age. This book was also completed in that year and printed with movable type. This was the first edition. According to the preface written by Mr. Li's younger brother, Youfen (Xiangyuan):</p>
<p>"The Chronicle of Events in the History of Liao and Jin Dynasties, a total of ninety-two volumes, was sent by my elder brother Feisheng from Xiajiang. I have read the preface and written a general introduction. I have taken the books of Yuan and Chen and read them extensively, connecting the cumulative series. Only the Liao and Jin dynasties have not been compiled. In the past, the officials of the Siku Quanshu included the Liao and Jin dynasties in the Chronicle of Events in the History of the Song Dynasty, saying that it should be called the Chronicle of Events of the Three Dynasties, and should not be named Song Dynasty alone, criticizing its prejudice. I have examined Chen's book, and there is much involvement of the two countries, but it is still a compilation of the Song Dynasty, and the name is not wrong. This is just a superficial argument. However, recording the Liao and Jin dynasties is different from other histories. The names and official titles of the people are not familiar with translation, and one person appears repeatedly, and there are many historical errors. Moreover, the history was compiled casually, the selection was not extensive, there were many omissions, and there were occasional ink errors. The difficulty of following up and writing is not easy. Previous people asked for things, and only left this compilation. It is really not a matter of dealing with the separate departments and starting and ending the group. My elder brother's compilation started in the Jiashen year (1884) and has been in compilation for a decade."</p>
<p>In the Yiyi year (1895), it was reprinted in Shanghai with lithography, combining the original "Seven Kinds of Chronicle of Events" in the middle box edition into nine, which was the reprinted edition, and it was slightly revised. In his later years, Mr. Li revised and supplemented the entire book, and it was carved and reprinted in the GuiMao winter (1903), and it took a year to complete the storage. This was the final edition. At the end of the book, a new preface was written by Mr. Li's cousin, Yu (Xiaoyuan):</p>
<p>"In the past, those who wrote books often left out selections, and they always disliked being brief. My father spent more than ten years of hard work searching for books, starting in the official residence of Xiajiang. In the Guiyi year (1893), my father was assigned to patrol Gao Lian, and sent it to the office. At that time, Yu changed his official status to Shuchang and went to Guangdong Province to meet. With his brothers, he divided the company into Xiangxiao, and gave it to the people to print. ... Later, because his energy did not decline, and he had leisure time, he re-edited it. He saw that the two dynasties' regulations and golden inscriptions had not been collected, and he could not bear to part with them. There were some errors in the sentences, and my father specialized in adding and supplementing them, and the translators corrected them. The system remained the same, and things were complete, so that it could be more and more complete, hoping to avoid regrets. Yu believes that ancient famous scholars and sages did not tire of seeking details in their works. Even Zhu Xi of Kaoting also had books of final conclusions in his later years, but the compilation from the door is not as good as the correction by hand."</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Jiaxiang of Kuaiji said in his Tang Reading Notes:</p>
<p>"The Chronicle of Events category has always had Zuo Zhuan, Tongjian, Song History, Yuan History, Ying Qin History, and Ming History Chronicle of Events. Liao and Jin were not compiled because they were biased, but they were not covered by the Song History. Moreover, they have long been listed in the official history, and the Chronicle of Events should not be missing. Youtang created these two books, which were unprecedented. The first draft was carved in Pingxiang, and I once ordered workers to print it. This edition was lithographed in Shanghai by his nephew, Taishi Xiaotan. There was also a revised edition in his later years, which I have not seen."</p>
<p>Also, in the Four Concubine Pavilion Poetry Collection (unpublished draft) of Mr. Liu Youfu of Ji'an, there are four chapters of "Li Feisheng, a scholar of the Hanlin Academy, sent me the Chronicle of Events of Liao and Jin Dynasties, and I wrote it as a thank you." One sentence in the second chapter says: "How many times has the linen yarn been proofread, and now the original and the end are twice as clear." A note below says: "This book has been revised three times." One sentence in the fourth chapter says: "A bundle of Langhan has been sent repeatedly, and it is still necessary to use Bian Ku to expect each other." A note below says: "I sent a copy for correction during the reprint." All of the above are sufficient to prove it. As for the last time this book was carved, although it has gone through turmoil in the past forty years, it is still preserved as it is today.</p>
<h3>Chinese Book Cataloging Method</h3>
<p>— Lu Fengtai</p>
<p>Compiled by Lou Yunlin, published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>Recently, in the Chinese library community, two books on cataloging have been published one after another. One is "Okazaki Book Cataloging" compiled by Mr. Jin Minfu, published by Zhengzhong Book Company in the 35th year of the Republic of China, and the other is "Chinese Okazaki Book Cataloging Method" compiled by Mr. Lou Yunlin, published by Zhonghua Book Company in June of the 36th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Compared with Mr. Jin's "Okazaki Book Cataloging," it can be said that Mr. Jin's book focuses on a general review of the cataloging work methods of various books. This book, in addition to the general book cataloging method, provides detailed explanations of the cataloging methods of rare books, local chronicles, Okazaki yearbooks, and periodical publications. This can be said to be the characteristic of this book.</p>
<p>As a cultural institution, if its internal scope is large and its history is long, then in addition to ordinary circulating books, there are more or less rare books in its collection. As for local chronicles, annual reports, and periodicals, they are common to libraries of all sizes. However, there has never been a detailed cataloging method for this type of special book for reference.</p>
<p>Cataloging is one of the most cumbersome tasks in library operations, and cataloging rare books is the most difficult part of this cumbersome task. Now, Mr. Lou's book happens to solve this problem. In Chapter 5, the examination of rare books, the version, the examination of volumes, the style, the identification of fonts, the abstract of chapters and symbols, the examination of marks, the identification of paper quality and ink color, the description of binding, and the record of collections and Danhuang are all explained in detail in separate sections. With this chapter, the difficult problem of cataloging rare books can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Newspapers and magazines have become an important part of our daily life in modern life, because in addition to reporting news, all kinds of novel and important materials related to culture and academics are scattered in various newspapers and magazines. Therefore, scholars since modern times have used newspapers and magazines as one of the important materials for learning. A library, regardless of its size, subscribes to hundreds of newspapers, or dozens. However, in the past, the cataloging method for this type of newspaper was not detailed, so that the cultural and academic materials scattered in various newspapers could not be fully utilized. This book also explains the newspaper cataloging method and the military chapter catalog index method in detail.</p>
<p>The whole book is 226 pages long and is divided into eight chapters. Chapter 1 General Outline. Chapter 2 Brief Description of Book Classification. Chapter 3 General Book Cataloging Method, Chapter 4 How to Write Card Catalogs, Chapter 5 Rare Book Cataloging Method, Chapter 6 Cataloging Methods for Local Chronicles, Annual Reports, etc., Chapter 7 Periodical Cataloging Method, Chapter 8 Reference Books on Cataloging.</p>
<h3>"The Sorrows of an Inventor"</h3>
<p>— Lu Xian</p>
<p>Written by Balzac, translated by Gao Mingkai</p>
<p>"The Sorrows of an Inventor" is one of Balzac's "Illusions Perdues Trilogy." The other two are "Two Poets" and "A Great Man from the Provinces in Paris." I have read all of Balzac's "Celibates Trilogy," but I have read the least of this "Illusions Perdues Trilogy." Perhaps the reason is that I am a little afraid of watching tragedies, or perhaps it is because there are already too many illusory tragedies being staged in our real society, which makes people a little afraid of seeing the word "illusion."</p>
<p>But after I read "The Sorrows of an Inventor," I had a more ardent admiration for Balzac's great pen. — Balzac's "illusion" is not the "illusion" of people in a society where utilitarianism is prevalent; just as Lao Zhuang's nihilistic tendency is different from Russian nihilism.</p>
<p>The story is very simple: David, who has a scholarly demeanor, opened a printing factory, but handed over all the factory affairs to employees. He himself concentrated on the research of papermaking. If this diligent research is successful, it may enable him to obtain a lot of profit and get rich immediately. David is completely a thinker, an inventor, kind-hearted and simple-minded. Therefore, the papermaking technology has not yet been invented, and he himself has become the prey of the capitalist Goonder brothers' conspiracy. His brother-in-law Lucien also caused a minor disaster, implicating David and forcing the latter to flee and hide. But in the life of fleeing and hiding, David still kept thinking about the research of papermaking. If it were not for his wife Evie's pure love to support him, David's future would be unimaginable. Finally, under the resourceful mediation of the evil lawyer Bertie-Crow, David finally "reconciled" with the Goonder brothers. In other words, he willingly became the prey of the Goonder brothers. Although the research on papermaking was all successful, most of the profits fell into the hands of the Goonder brothers, and David himself became an employee of the Goonder brothers.</p>
<p>Writing about how capitalists use the magic of money to force inventors to bow their heads and become their slaves should be the theme of "The Sorrows of an Inventor." Naturally, the descriptions of the judicial system in France in the early 19th century, the unreasonableness of the law, and the dangerous schemes of lawyers should be the sub-themes of this book. In a short novel of more than 100,000 words, Balzac analyzed some of the dark sides of French provincial life with great talent. He arranged more than a dozen characters in this novel, such as David's straightforward scholarly demeanor, Evie's charming little wife's posture, old Schiel's (David's father) stinginess is very much like old Ge Tie, the servant Gorbon's loyalty, Serisi's cunning, the capitalist Goonder brothers' reed-like wit, the lawyer Bertie-Crow's "tolerance" and "ruthlessness," the dandy Luke's innocence and complacency, etc., almost all of them are typical characters. Among Balzac's famous works, the scene of "The Sorrows of an Inventor" may not be as good as "Cousin Bette" (translated by Mu Mutian, Commercial Press edition); the exquisiteness may not be as good as "Eugenie Grandet" (translated by Gao Mingkai, Haiyan edition), but in any case, this is after all a famous work of Balzac that directly faces the judicial system of France and loudly denounces it. Compared with "The Priest of Tours" and "La Rabouilleuse," I prefer "The Sorrows of an Inventor."</p>
<p>In the whole book, the most lovable characters are naturally David and Evie, a typical couple of kind intellectuals. Without Evie's delicacy, there would be no way to reflect David's straightforwardness. The two are indispensable. Lucien's naive and complacent posture makes people feel both pitiful and hateful. However, his wealthy behavior is not enough to cover up all the innocence in his heart. Therefore, under Balzac's pen, he is not a definitive character after all. When he knew that he had become the root of the disaster of the great operation, he decided to commit suicide in a daze. Balzac described this section of his departure in the middle of the night with extremely beautiful portrayal. Old priest Hora Carlos County is the only legendary character in the whole book. Just like Balzac's insertion of the great thief Vautrin in "Old Man Goriot," Balzac used the mouth of the Carlos priest to express his criticism of the money-worshiping society in France at that time. I am especially confused by his words:</p>
<p>"You have to change your behavior: please show your beauty, your elegance, your poetic talent. If you want to do some small bad things, you should do them within the four walls. Then, you will not have the crime of staining the ground on this stage called the world. Napoleon called this: "Washing clothes at home." From this we can draw a conclusion: everything is formal. Some people who have not been educated use force to rob others of a sum of money because of the pressure of needs; people call them criminals, and they have to be punished by law. A talented poor man finds a secret, the development of this secret is really equivalent to a treasure house, you borrow him three thousand francs, you give him a hard time, and you have to let him give up all the secrets to you, you only use your conscience to calculate, and your conscience will not bring you to the court to judge criminals..."</p>
<p>The priest then taught Lucien that to be a "big man" in society, first, he must not be afraid of shame; second, he must try his best to decorate his appearance; and third, he must do it secretly. He gave many examples to prove how Napoleon, Richelieu, and the Medicis climbed to high positions. Extrapolating from his theory, people naturally think of the nihilistic philosophy of the great thief Vautrin. In Balzac's novels, what these characters represent may be Balzac's "second self"; although his theory seems a little too cynical.</p>

<h3>"Refugee Emperor"</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>This winter relief relied on the efforts and donations of enthusiastic people, and the results were quite satisfactory. However, it may still be difficult to provide good help to the truly poor refugees who are about to die, because there is a group of fake refugees who live on refugees between them and the relief agency, that is, the so-called "refugee emperors." They prevent the relief goods from benefiting those who need relief, and fall into the pockets of local ruffians.</p>
<p>Usually, in a slum area, there is always a so-called "refugee representative" who manages all relief matters, applies for various donations on their behalf, collects fees for building sheds and digging holes, and receives liaison investigators - when any agency or group goes to visit and distribute relief, they come forward and pretend to be enthusiastic, and they also get in touch with fellow villagers' associations: but they treat the refugees with a ferocious face and harsh words. Poor kind farmers who have just been displaced to Shanghai from other towns have no relatives, and are unfamiliar with the place. Who can they complain to! It is difficult for them to receive the substantial benefits of the relief funds of hundreds of millions of dollars. On the contrary, they have to offer the daily begging income to the "representative." Often, the refugees can't even eat enough noodles, but the "representative" is full of fat and rice!</p>
<p>They rely on having been in Shanghai for many years. Some of them were originally local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside. And many grassroots workers in relief work, such as Baojia chiefs, do not understand the language of the refugees, and some people are discouraged when they see such a dirty and smelly situation. So they push it to the "representative," and as a result, those parasites are leisurely and can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>They not only exploit the relief supplies and donations that are distributed, but also plan on these suffering people. For example, the garbage picked up every day is sold by them, and if new refugees move into the open space, they have to pay their respects to them first. There are many bad situations, too numerous to mention. If we want to do a good job in relief work, we must first completely eradicate this special class of "refugee emperors"!</p>
<h3>A Singer's Confession</h3>
<p>— Cheng Juntao</p>
<p>Spiritual solace can enable a singer to overcome material and physiological difficulties. This is the valuable experience that opera star Lily Pons has gained in recent years.</p>
<p>"Don't sing too much" has always been a golden rule for singers. For many years, Lily Pons strictly adhered to it. Because, according to the experience of past music and medical experts, singing too much can make a person feel tired and lose the power to control breathing and pronunciation, resulting in the inability to sing beautiful sounds. However, Lily Pons made a new discovery while performing concerts for the troops during World War II. She felt that as long as she had spiritual comfort, it didn't matter if she sang a little more.</p>
<p>Normally, Lily Pons stipulates that she should only perform a maximum of four times a week, but during wartime travel concerts for the troops, she averaged two performances a day. The singing locations were on the front lines in Persia, Africa, Italy, India, Burma, China, France, Belgium, and Germany. After dizzying high-altitude flights, sitting in bumpy, hard jeeps, and eating simple food, Lily Pons' voice was not affected.</p>
<p>"I have never sung so well in my life!" Lily Pons said during her tour. After careful study, she felt that this was not accidental. She discovered that when she sang, the reaction she received was unparalleled spiritual solace, which invisibly overcame material and physiological difficulties, and even increased the effectiveness of her singing. She had the following record:</p>
<p>"The most important reaction from traveling to perform for the troops is that magical spiritual comfort. Singing in front of those brave children, shaking hands with them, talking to them, that kind of happiness is beyond description. When I feel that my singing can give them some comfort, I feel so happy! This kind of feeling really gives people great power. At that time, you won't think about personal comfort, and you won't have time to feel tired. If some of the difficulties encountered in these tour concerts for the troops occurred during a regular professional concert tour, it would be a fatal blow to a general singer - I think they would not be able to withstand it."</p>
<p>From her work with the troops, Lily Pons gained a new perspective on life. This perspective has helped her singing. She felt that if an artist could do their best to give the public spiritual comfort, they would surely achieve great success.</p>
<p>Many people think that music is not easy to appreciate, but according to Lily Pons' experience, many soldiers originally did not have much knowledge of music, but she felt that people have an innate ability to appreciate things that are "true, good, and beautiful." Bach-Gounod's "Ave Maria" is one of the programs that Lily Pons must include in every concert, and it is also one of the most popular programs.</p>
<p>Lily Pons said that the whole world now needs the comfort of "true, good, and beautiful" music, and even more needs artists who are willing to serve the public!</p>
<h3>Movies Fifty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Chai Fei</p>
<p>Movies originated in 1896. By 1903, starting from a small-scale operation similar to a peep show, it gradually had its business foundation, its own technology, and its own audience.</p>
<p>The world's earliest movie was shown on April 23, 1896, at Koster &amp; Bial's Music Hall in New York, USA. This music hall is the former site of the Chase Company. On that day, The New York Times reported on this world's earliest movie as follows: "Last night, the lights in the music hall were completely turned off. In the dim corner building, there was a lot of noise and excitement. Soon, a strange ray of light shone directly on a white curtain. Then everyone saw two young actors from the amusement park, dressed in red and blue costumes, quickly dancing a parachute dance. Their movements can be said to be vividly portrayed. When they disappeared, everyone saw a surge of waves crashing against the stone embankment on the beach, and everyone was taken aback... After a short while, a thin and long clown and a short and fat clown performed a funny boxing match, followed by an allegorical comedy called "Monroe Doctrine", and a fragment taken from Hoyt's comedy "A Milk White Flag" was repeated many times. Finally, a tall girl performed a skirt dance. All these shadow plays were performed very realistically and won enthusiastic applause from the audience."</p>
<p>The surprise evoked by this new invention was obviously very widespread, and people simply regarded it as a magical thing. The lifelike parachute dance was stunning, the terrifying waves made everyone break out in a cold sweat, the reproduction of the song and dance comedy made people excited, and everyone was satisfied with the skirt dance. According to Dickson, an assistant to the inventor Edison: "This is a new invention of magical illusion. The magic of the nineteenth century has reached its peak."</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police and Puppet Police</h3>
<p>— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion</p>
<p>Our country has repeatedly reported sending dozens of military police officers to Japan. It is said that the number of people and expenses need to be considered and negotiated with the Allied countries. This matter will definitely be realized. People in the old capital believe that the sooner the better, and the number of people is a secondary issue. Even if one or two people are sent to Tokyo to show off their power, it can slightly relieve the accumulated anger of the past eight years. The reason is that when the Japanese military police were stationed in China, the Chinese compatriots were subjected to anger and abuse, and the impression was worse than any other Japanese arrogance.</p>
<p>The Japanese "soldiers" and "officials" certainly have different names, such as the so-called "Dispatch Army Headquarters," the so-called "Asia Development Board Liaison Department," and the so-called "Ministers" and "Consuls," each with its own arrogance. However, those who come into contact with them are senior officials of the puppet committee, and there are some formalities and procedures, and they are still relatively far from the lives of the people. However, the military police are rampant and unruly, without any boundaries, deceiving everyone, and interfering in everything. They often break into people's homes to capture and torture them, and the citizens are so scared that they become a "terrorist object" in the city.</p>
<p>If Japanese military and political officials want to do anything, they often inform the puppet committee to carry it out in the name of Chinese officials. However, the Japanese military police disregard everything and issue announcements under the title of "Military Police Corps." For example, the distribution of food has nothing to do with their authority, but they also post announcements. Not only are the puppet officials embarrassed, but even the Japanese commanders and officers are not in the eyes of the Japanese military police. Puppet ministers and puppet governors were also sometimes summoned by the Japanese military police. Only changing "summon" to "invite" was considered particularly polite. For example, Wang Shijing was often one of the people who was "invited."</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Political Committee also has a military police force, but it has no power and is just a figurehead. Occasionally, there are routine inspections, etc. The puppet newspaper records must add the words "Chinese" to it, otherwise people will mistakenly think it is a Japanese team. Because when "military police" is mentioned, everyone knows that it is Japanese. At the time, it was said that the "supreme government" of the puppet association was not in the Japanese military headquarters, but in the Japanese military police. This is the truth, and it is also a joke!</p>
<p>In addition, another "terrorist object" is the enemy's puppet "traffic police." The enemy used its "South Manchuria Railway Company" to control the railways in North China, calling it the "North China Transportation Company," and separately formed its police force, the "North China Transportation Police," who specialized in searching passengers at various stations and on trains, arbitrarily beating and scolding them without any reason. Their female puppet police officers teased and ridiculed the beautiful male actors, while the Japanese soldiers sneered from the side. Even senior officials of the puppet government and their families, unless they were taken care of by the Japanese chiefs, could hardly avoid being insulted by the puppet traffic police, in order to show that they were not under the jurisdiction of Chinese officials, which could be boasted about.</p>
<h3>On Painting Inscriptions</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Inscription poems on paintings should be concise and relevant. Just like calligraphy emphasizes "vitality and rhythm," painting originally requires deep meaning and simple language. So-called deep and obvious expression is interesting. If the language and meaning are equally deep, it's not "top-notch," let alone if the meaning is shallow and the language is deep. It is said that the old doggerel poems in our country were created by oil workers. Because the language was vulgar, it was called the "doggerel style," and people looked down on it. In fact, this is forgetting one's roots. Try looking at the part of the Book of Songs that describes Chinese customs. Isn't it just the folk songs of the alleys? Qing Zhou Liyuan first inscribed on a white-headed bird standing on a peach blossom tree: "Peach blossoms are already three thousand years old, and the blue bird flies here with a white head." Because the white-headed bird was difficult to depict, he thought of the long age of the peach tree to set off the reason for the bird's white head. The meaning is so profound, but even a first-grade elementary school student can recognize these dozen words. Can you say it's not a good poem? Another person painted a monkey sleeping on a withered vine and inscribed it: "The monkey should wake up now, don't wait for the vine to wither and the tree to fall." It is truly thought-provoking. Someone else inscribed on a photo of a prostitute surnamed Hua: "So captivating, her surname must be Hua." These seven characters are also extremely vivid. Unfortunately, I don't have the painting on hand, so I can't give the name in detail.) Another example is Wu Wei of the Ming Dynasty, who inscribed a painting: "An old man with white hair, riding a buffalo to drink water; hooves stepping on hooves on the bank, mouths facing mouths in the water." It is truly a realistic scene and can be called a masterpiece. Another anonymous person inscribed on a painting of a beggar: "I beg for my food, what does it have to do with you; born with a snobbish dog's nature, only biting torn clothes!" It portrays the snobbish situation of society in detail. Reading it evokes endless emotions. As for Feng Haisu of the Yuan Dynasty, he inscribed a small song on a painting of Yang Guifei suffering from toothache: "Qinghua Palace, a tooth aches, Mawei Slope, the whole body aches, the drums of Yuyang shake the earth, the world aches!" These few words are extremely straightforward!</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Such a Wonderful Night (35)</p>
<p>Zhu looked at the clothes in the cabinet, and then pressed his hand on the suitcase, and smiled: "Don't worry, let me try it for you." Then he took out all the clothes in the suitcase, re-folded them one by one, very carefully, evenly and steadily, put them in the box one by one, and put them in a very orderly manner. Qihuan helped him take the clothes at first, but later, when she saw Zhu Zhai refolding the clothes she had already folded, and had to fit the size of the box, she laughed: "Zhu, you work like a woman, extremely meticulous, I am an impatient person, not as good as you!" Saying that, she put her hands on her waist and stood still, watching Zhu Zhai pack up. Zhu Zhai was not afraid of trouble, and in an orderly manner, he packed all the clothes in the box, then pressed hard and fastened the box, and said to Qi Huan with a smile: "How is it? I have put them all in!" Qi Huan was so happy that she leaned up to Zhu Zhai, tightly grasped his hand, shook it several times and said: "Thank you! Thank you! I really didn't expect that you, who were so brave at Shichahai last time, are so meticulous in packing things today. You must be tired, and it's not early, please take a rest!" Saying that, she took Zhu Zhai's hand and went to the outer room together, seeing that Wang Ma had already set up a small bed against the wall, with the quilt and blanket all neatly laid out. Qi Huan pointed to the small bed and said: "I'm sorry, just rest on this bed for a while, and it will be dawn." Zhu Zhai said: "Why bother! I can just sit for a while." Qi Huan said: "That won't do, you should lie down and close your eyes to refresh yourself." Seeing her repeatedly urging him, Zhu Zhai had no choice but to take off his suit jacket and lie down on the small bed. Qi Huan personally covered him with the quilt and blanket, tucking it in tightly on both sides, before raising her hand and saying "See you tomorrow!" With a sweet smile, she turned around and naturally walked into the bedroom. Zhu Zhai's emotions, after being stirred by her, his heart was still throbbing, and he couldn't fall asleep. Closing his eyes, Qi Huan's beautiful smiling face appeared before him, and he only heard the whistling wind outside, shaking the windows and rustling. Lying on the bed, tossing and turning, he just couldn't fall asleep. Thinking of Qi Huan's tender feelings and honey-like affection, which made people drunk, such a lovely girl, she was leaving tomorrow, and a feeling of reluctance arose in his heart, and he couldn't help but sigh slightly. Immediately, he heard Qi Huan asking in the bedroom: "Zhu, are you still not asleep?" Zhu Zhai smiled and said: "Yes, I can't sleep, how about you?" Qi Huan said: "I can't sleep either, the wind is very strong outside, and I feel particularly sad when I hear the wind." Zhu Zhai replied: "Isn't that right? I feel the same way!" Qi Huan said: "It's already five o'clock now, and it will be dawn in another hour. Since you can't sleep, why don't you come in and talk?" As soon as Zhu Zhai heard this, he turned over and sat up, and without even putting on his coat, he hurried into the bedroom, only to see Qi Huan wrapped in a brocade quilt, smiling slightly. He couldn't help but feel dazed! Suddenly hearing Jiang Huan say: "I am a person who is very proud and cares a lot about my face." These two sentences were like a morning bell, immediately awakening him from his infatuation. He thought to himself that I respect her, my love for her is pure, the noblest love, how can I turn to intimacy! I am a married man, how can I do this! In that instant, only this thought flashed through his mind, and he stopped, and smiled at Qi Huan: "I'm sorry!"</p>
<h3>In the Midst of Solicitation</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>At the end of last year, my wife and I went to the state-owned goods company to buy things. As soon as we walked up the stairs, several young middle school students stopped us and asked us to donate some money to the poor refugees to make winter clothes with a smile. They all wore rectangular credentials on their clothes, hung school badges, and were very sincere in their attitude. Of course, I was very happy to donate some money, and they quickly filled out a receipt for me on the goods counter of the state-owned goods company. At that time, I couldn't help but have a feeling of gratitude and love for them.</p>
<p>During the New Year's Day holiday, I took my child to the park. I was helping him take steps on the grass when I suddenly looked up and saw three young people standing in front of me, two men and one woman, who said to me: "We are students from ×× University. Because the tuition fee for the next semester is too expensive, many students are in danger of dropping out of school. Therefore, we have launched a fundraising campaign. Please help us a little." I took out some money, and they thanked me repeatedly, giving me a well-printed rectangular card with the number and amount printed on it—it was as if it was still missing the stamp of a responsible fundraising organization.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday at noon, I came out of the office and went to a Cantonese restaurant for lunch. As soon as I ordered the food, a young man who looked like a student came, holding a large stack of books, about twenty or thirty books, walked up to me, put the books on the table, and said: "I am a student from ×× University. Because the tuition fee for the next semester is too expensive, I have trafficked some books, please buy a few." I really wanted to buy one or two of them, but when I looked at the books, I was stunned—they were all "Star Song Selections," "Chinese and Western Movie Songs," and a few very "yellow" novels. Only one copy of "A Tale of Two Cities" was barely satisfactory, but my heart felt a little cold. Perhaps I hesitated for too long, and the young man said coldly, "I'm sorry," and had already turned to another table.</p>
<p>Just now, I wanted to go to the movies. The director of that movie was an old friend of mine for more than ten years, so when I saw the "Sold Out" sign in front of the theater, although I felt regret that I couldn't get in, I was also happy for my old friend, and I stood there looking at the stills in the window. Unexpectedly, at this moment, another neatly dressed young man walked up to me, smiling and whispering that he had tickets. The price he quoted was more than half the price of the ticket, and he explained: "There's no way, the tuition fee for the next semester is too high, so..."</p>
<p>However, I only felt infinite disappointment, and I really had no mood to watch the movie anymore.</p>
<h3>Manila Musings</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>It is often reported that Manila is devastated by hurricanes, and it has become an important headline in the news. Therefore, I have gathered some trivial matters about the city to fill in the blanks for this publication.</p>
<p>Manila is a city in the Philippines that was developed very early. As early as 1570, it had already come into contact with the Spanish. The local natives spread the rumor that these foreigners were monsters who ate pebbles, swallowed fire, and had tails, so they were initially very afraid of them. Later, when Chinese, Dutch, British, and Americans arrived there one after another, they became accustomed to it. It is said that Filipinos like Americans the most, not because Americans treat them particularly well, but because Americans introduced Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>In the early 16th century, Spaniards who migrated to Manila already had trade relations with our country. The goods brought by our merchants included silk and porcelain, etc. Manila's export goods mainly included shark fins, seafood, etc.</p>
<p>The language of Manila is very complex, divided into eight major categories, with more than eighty kinds in total. Every Manileño must be a natural linguist, otherwise it is not enough to cope with daily communication. There is also a strange disease there, locally called "Mali mali," in which the patient imitates the other person's slang and actions when he or she meets anyone, and cannot control it.</p>
<p>The women of Manila are very capable. About half of the dentists in the city are women. The general manager of a large-scale Manila inland airline before the war was also a female entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Saint Thomas is the oldest university there, established earlier than Harvard University in the United States.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Sponsoring Dental Hospital Affiliated to Dental College Donates Free Dental Treatment Coupons to Public Education Personnel</h3>
<p>This column sponsors the "Free Treatment Coupons" donated by the affiliated hospital of the Shanghai Dental College. Three hundred tickets were issued in June, July, and August. Recently, there have been several letters from all parties requesting them. This column has consulted with the hospital, and it has generously agreed to continue to handle it. However, this application is aimed at public education personnel. When applying, a written application must be filled out, stamped and certified by the person in charge of the service unit, and an envelope with sufficient postage and the name and address of the recipient written on it must be attached. After this column has reviewed and approved it, a free treatment coupon will be sent. Applications that do not meet the requirements will not be processed.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Winter Clothing Drive Ends Concentration of Efforts to Raise Scholarship Funds</h3>
<p>This newspaper's "Winter Clothing Drive," which was sponsored by one organization, started on December 21st of last year and lasted for ten days. It has already expired. During the fundraising period, thanks to the enthusiastic support of readers, whether donating large sums of money or donating winter clothes, this campaign has achieved satisfactory results. This newspaper will complete the sorting out in the next few days and then hand over these winter clothes and donations to the city's winter relief association for distribution to various charities. The fundraising has now stopped, and donations and winter clothes will no longer be accepted, in order to fully prepare for the scholarship campaign that will begin soon. We are afraid that this has not been fully informed, so we hereby announce it.</p>
<h3>Readers' Mailbox</h3>
<p>To Mr. Zhang Xizhen: If this woman is already someone's fiancée, she cannot enter into another engagement with you before the engagement is dissolved. It is said that this man's behavior is improper and that he has recently been imprisoned. If it is a sentence of imprisonment, the woman may file for dissolution of the engagement in accordance with Article 976, Item 8 of the Civil Code. The woman is twenty years old, and must be twenty years old to be considered an adult. To enter into an engagement as a minor requires the consent of a legal guardian (parents). If you and this woman wish to marry, Mr. Someone will naturally not be able to interfere if legal procedures are followed.</p>
