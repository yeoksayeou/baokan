<h3>蔣總統致詞全文　把握時機督促改革庶政　縮短戰禍實現統一和平</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕蔣總統廿日就任演詞全文如次：</p>
<p>中正承國民大會依照憲法選舉爲中華民國總統，擔任國家和人民的公責，當此就職伊始，追念我國父和先烈締造民國的艱難，省察我國家民族所處的環境，以及全體同胞的期望，深深感覺到責任重大，負荷艱鉅。我自從許身國事以來，一向祗知道效忠服務是自己的天職，，今天膺此名位，實非本懷。廿年來內憂外患接踵而至，因長期的抗戰與戡亂而未能達成建設的目標，深目惶愧，今後我們全國不僅在戡亂中要建立民主，更應從戡亂中求建設，求進步，這個救國的大業，不是一手一足所能成功，亦不是一朝一夕所能集事，旣承國民課我以責任，更望國民給我以助力，特就今後國家的需要，政府人民共同努力的方針，掬其誠悃，吿我全國同胞。　實行憲政是中華民國前所未有的大事，我們經歷無數的犧牲困難和挫折，纔能完成今日實施憲政的程序，這是長期苦鬥所獲的結果，這是五十餘年來我革命抗戰光烈和全體軍民流血汗的結品，我們必須珍護這一個艱難創造的成果，每一個人都有神聖的責任，行憲是爲了國家的前途，也爲了人民的福利，如果國家不能因行憲而達到統一獨立和繁榮，人民不能因行憲而得到幸福和進步，則行憲將失其意義，行憲以後，第一個要務就是使憲法不祗是文字，而要見諸實行，因之，嚴格還行這一部憲法，是行憲政府的責任，也是全國同胞每一個人應有的責任。國家的主權在於全體人民，救國建國的責任，也就在於全體人民，在行憲之始，更須全體國民盡責守紀，人人有奉公守法的精神，養成先公後私的習慣，纔能達成這次行憲的目的。我們必須尊重憲法，實行憲法，確立法治的基礎，同時更須全體國民瞭解民主的眞諦，向眞正的民主而學習。要知道民主制度是一種生活方式，不僅表現在政治方面，也表現在經濟和社會以及各種職業的活動上面，民主國家的國民，決不放棄權利，也決不推諉義務，民主是要少數服從多數，但絕不是多數壓迫少數，更不容少數刦持多數，每一個公民要有自尊心，要有表達公正意見的機會，也要有接受批評和犧牲小我的精神，我必以身作則，以全副心力擁護憲法，遵守憲法，培養我們民主的習慣，導引我們國家向眞正的民主大道邁進，我和政府同人在此行憲開始的時候，必當恪守憲法所規定的範圍，執行憲法所賦予的職責，爲中國的民主奠立永久不拔的基礎。</p>
<p>消滅共匪有效方法　惟有政經社會革新</p>
<p>我們中華民國憲法制定的主旨，在於「鞏固國權，保障民權，」當前國家最大的需要，是統一自由和進步，而稱兵叛國，搗亂社會秩序的共匪，則是國家統一的障碍和自由進步的敵人，我們對於製造分裂，破壞建設的反民主的惡勢力，必須集合全國力量，澈底的予以根本的淸除，憲政政府成立以後，必須進一步整頓軍事，加强軍事，在短期內戡平叛亂，使匪區同胞雖水深火熱的痛苦，民族生存與歷史文化，不致感受威脅。同時，我們要必使全國政治，經濟，敎育，社會各方面一切的措施與戡亂軍事相配合，今天的戡亂軍事，決不是黨派意氣之私，更不是什麽得失利害之爭，乃是民主對極權，統一對分裂，愛國對禍國，人道對殘暴，生存對毁滅的全民族救亡自救的戰爭。今天實在是國脈民侖存亡絕續的設重關頭，中正受侖于危念之際，個人的成敗樂辱，早已置于度外，惟有鞠躬盡瘁，期達我畢生報國救國的志節，我確信全國民衆自覺自發的力量乃是剗除共匪最堅强的力量，也惟有政治，經濟，社會全般的革新，才是消滅共匪最有效的方法，爲了維護民國的基礎，爲了保障人民的幸福，我懇切號召我全國愛好自由的愛國同胞們及時奮發，在三民主義憲政之下，一致動員，集中意志，貢獻力量，來完成戡亂的工作，縮短戰爭的災禍，恢復正常的秩序，以實現國家統一與和平。</p>
<p>整肅吏治樹立紀綱　保障人民合法權利</p>
<p>國家承八年抗戰之餘，敵偽遺毒還未淸除，共匪陰謀突然擴大，致使復員建設和善後整理的原定計劃遭受阻授，由社會而影響經濟，由經濟而影響政治，由政治而影響民生，今日國勢的嚴重是不可否認的，政治與社會上各種缺點亦是不可否認的，這些嚴重的缺點，必須迅速的加以改革，更是毫無疑問的。但是最有效的改革，必須通過制度和法律，必須適應大多數民衆的要求，更必須分別本末輕重，有步驟，有計劃的來實行，我們行憲以後，制度是革新了，政府和人民的關係是更接近了，我個人旣承受國民鄭重的付託，我必以最大的誠意和決心，把握這一個更新的時機，督促我們政府着手於庶政的改革，我認爲新政府主要必須整肅吏治，樹立紀綱，根絕一切假借在位營私自利的行爲，必須登用賢能刷新人事，以提高各級行政的效能，必須厲行老核，嚴明賞罰，勤求民隱，以革除虛僞泄沓的政風，减除地方民衆所受法外的苛　，更必須簡化法令，釐訂權責，統一執行的機構，芟除繁複與不切實際的法親。總之，要提高法令的尊嚴，保障合法的權利，使法律之前人人平等，使人民在履行公民養務與發展私人能力上，獲得機會的平等。</p>
<p>經濟措施主要方針　穩定物價充裕民生</p>
<p>在經濟措施方面我們把要貫澈民生主義的實施，我們新憲法基本國策事關國民經濟與社會安全的規定，都是根據國父民生主義的遺敎，我們今天已不需另尋途徑，新政府成立後，我和政府同人，必以全力循這個目標而施行。在治標方面，我們要以有效的方法穩定幣値，平衡收支，管理金融，改善交通，使物價趨於安定人民得免窮困。在治本方面，我們要實事求是，來推行土地改革，保護佃農利益，推廣農地貸款，以平均地權，試用累進稅率，徵收過分利得，取締投機暴利，以節制資本。同時更要推行合作朮業，　滬農工生產，保護合法貿易，歡迎國際投資，以增加物資的數量、充裕人民的生活，我們始終譯定政治自由與經濟平等，爲三民主義固有的目標，新政府屬立以後，第一件事就是要用適　實際的計劃確切的步驟，來實現這一個目標。總之，我們認爲，國家的利益，寄於人民本身的利益，而人民的利益，必須以大多數人民利益爲前提，這是新政對內措施的主要方針。</p>
<h3>蔣總統遵行節約　舊衣改製大禮服　首都氣象一新歡聲雷動</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕今晨總統副總統舉行宣誓就職典禮時，均未穿着就職前夕改製完工之禮服，此與觀禮者若干日來心所嚮往者相違。總統穿藍袍黑掛，環帶大紅色大綬，綬上佩一靑天白日勳章，副總統着戎裝，胸前佩六個勳章，隨立左後，一文一武，一前一後。典禮進行至向國旗及國父鞠躬禮，總統向後轉時，副總統有如嬪相之伴侍新郞，換位緊隨總統後左側，守禮甚謹。監誓人爲皓髮白髭之吳稚老，立於國旗及國父像前之左後側，身穿湖灰色大團花綢夾袍，典禮局長吳思豫穿軍裝，胸佩勳章，偕西式燕尾大禮服之國府文官長吳鼎昌同立臺中左側國大秘書長洪蘭友，亦穿西式大禮服，代表國民大會站立右前側，總統高舉右手面對國旗國父宣誦誓詞後，將紅封套誓書，遞與監誓人再與吳稚陣轉交洪蘭友，由國民大會保藏此一珍貴之歷史文獻。今日典禮儀式中，副總統僅就位而不宣誓，於總統宣誓及致詞時隨立後側。禮成後，與會者一齊起立，鼓掌聲久久始息；總統在歡動聲中，先後與副總統，監誓人握手，旋又回首向下含笑頻頻點首，歡愉之情，溢於顏表，然後緩步退出禮台。據悉：總統及副總統之大禮服均已製成。總統大禮服係首都一服裝公司就舊有元帥禮服所特別改製者，所費約八九千萬元。總統爲厲行簡約，未再重製新禮服，僅將原有主席禮服修改二處，一爲原來海陸空軍大元帥底肩章四顆金星改修爲五星，二爲兩袖上原有三條金環，改爲五顆梅花金星。副總統大禮服亦由同一服裝公司承製，其衣料及式樣均與總統相同，所異者惟肩章與陸軍底四顆金星，兩袖亦爲四顆梅花金星。據云：副總統禮服製費爲四億餘元。</p>
<p>外使節服裝各異　教廷公使一身紅</p>
<p>埃及公使戴紅帽子</p>
<p>外交使節的禮服各異，美洲除一二西班牙系的國家外，都祗穿着晚禮服佩起勛章，這種簡單的服飾，巴是近代外交社會的新興風氣；不過歐洲，尤其是西歐北歐，都仍是盎然中古之風，個個繡金大花玄色禮服，肩徽勛綬和佩劍都輝煌燦爛，一頂沿滾黑絨鬚的帽子夾在臂彎里，蘇聯和東歐的禮服在肩上和胸前仍有幾許昔日禮制，回敎國和西班牙系的中南美國家使節身上獨多朱紅顏色，埃及公使和土耳其代辦都戴一頂永不取下的紅帽子，多明尼加公使穿一件大紅上衣，但最引人注目的還是敎廷公使，從頭到脚，都是紅的，胸前佩了個大金十字架，外面還披了一襲紅敎衣。</p>
<p>蔣夫人過外賓席　各使節志立致敬</p>
<p>總統兩公子蒞臨觀禮</p>
<p>十時許總統夫人曁副總統夫人出現在主席台的邊門，由侍從引導着步下主席台，落座於畏官席中。蔣夫人穿一件深寳色綉福壽字軟緞鑲白綉花窄邊的長旗袍禮服，李夫人穿一件玄色素緞沿滾梅花壽字寬邊的長旗袍禮服，外面都罩　一件玄呢大衣；經過使節外賓席前時，他們全體都起立致敬，夫人們也含笑答禮。</p>
<p>蔣總統的二位公子蔣經國和蔣緯國，也都蒞臨觀禮，經國穿一身他天天穿的藏靑中山裝，緯國穿一身挺括的朱色凡立丁軍服。</p>
<h3>行政院長人選　總統令可提出　張羣何應欽呼聲均高</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕總統廿日就職後，其第一項任務，即提名行政院長人選，徵示立院同意，組成新政院，惟迄廿日午夜止，此項人選尙未提出。據悉：總統前曾商請張羣組織新閣，因張氏辭意甚堅，總統乃再度慎重考慮其他人選。聞總統請張羣組閣之意，並未打銷，同時則考慮請何應欽出任新行政院長。關係方面認爲新行政院長可能就張·何兩氏中選擇其一，而於廿一日下午正式提出。</p>
<p>〔又電〕立院廿日午後通過議事規則後，會議初階已吿一段落，總統之就職，使同意行政院長一事爲該院目前最重要之任務，該院將俟蔣總統提出行政院長人選徵詢同意之咨文到達後，即行決定全院委員會議之舉行，時期爲廿二日午後或爲廿二日晨，全院審査會議且將決定右無咨請總統通知所提人提出施政意見之必要。（立委廿人對政院長意見刊二版）</p>
<h3>新政府對外政策</h3>
<p>至　新政府的對外政策，我要就三部分來說明：</p>
<p>第一，關於聯合國的組織、新政府成立後，對外政策方面所負之第一責任，在於維雜及加　聯合咸組織的力量，中華民國憲法第一百四十一條，關於我國對聯合國的責任，已有明文規定，我們抵抗軸心國家八年抗戰的犧牲理想，聯合國組織迄今尙能未成爲一個維持世界和平的有力機構，這是無可諱言的，許多人鑒於這個組織在過去兩年中所遭遇的許多困難與挫折，遂至懷疑他的未來命運，與其存在的價値，我們決不允這種普遍懷疑心理的存在，而搖動我們的信念。反之，我們正因爲有這種疑慮的存在，更應該增加我們的努力，以維護幷加　聯合國的組織，就中國言，從前　際聯盟的失敗，我們可以說我們不負主要責任，但對聯合國　成敗，我們對於人類，對於歷史是有不可逃避的共同責任的，　爲中國是這個組織的一個發起　，而且是安全理事會的常任理　國。</p>
<p>第二，關於一般國際的合作，德日投降以後，同盟國間的關係，漸漸由一設的合作，轉到普遍的猜疑，這是我中國人民所最爲憂慮的，但是中國政策始終是一個和平合作的政策，我們對於一切國際合作問題，決不單從一國的利益的着想而輕視全世界和平繁榮與進步的需要。就經濟來說，我們是工商業落後的國家，但是我們不因此而拒絕參加國際貿易與關稅的協定。就政治來設，我們是一個內亂未靖，敎育落後的國家，但是我們幷不因此而延遲我們對於新聞自由會議等社會文化國際合作工作的參加，我們認爲戰後國際間最高的理想，是和平與合作，我們國民和海外僑民與友邦人民間的相處，必一本平等互惠的精神，盡量謀取相互友誼的增進，和相互地位的尊重。至於我們中國的經濟的復興，誠然需要國際的援助，但是我們深切認識，惟有厲行自助，乃能使國際援助發生眞正的效能，新政府成立以後，我們必繼續我們旣定的國際合作政策，同時亦必須切實厲行自助政第。</p>
<p>第三，關於和約的態度，當日本投降的時候，我曾經說過，中國對於日本決不採取報復主義，我認爲不論對德對日，聯合國都應該以堅定的一致的態度，採取這種寬大的政策，寬大決不是示弱，反之，合理的寬大，正是達到我們崇高理想的有效途徑，關於對日政策，我們認爲有兩點必須注意，（一）盟國必須盡最大的努力，輔助日本眞正民主勢力的成長，使日本的政治制度，社會制度與人民思想，能獲得眞正的改造，以根絕軍國主義的復活，我們的寬大政策能否成功，全要看我們這種努力是否切實與成功。（二）中國對日本並無任何過分的要求，但中國是一個飽受日本侵略，而抗戰八年以上的國家，在決定對日和平條款的時候，自不能不要求其他盟國承認我國在和會中應有一種特殊的地位，以上這三大要項，是我們對外主要方針，總之，對內要自強自立，對外要平等合作，我們政時，必秉此努力，以求貢獻於全世界正義與和平。</p>
<p>中正今天就職，正値國內叛亂未平，經濟動盪的時候，也正在世界和科還未確奠的時候，內省職責，外察環境，我不否認我們中國是擾患重重，我更不否認我們建國前途，是十分艱鉅，民主的基礎條件，還是薄弱，但是時代的力量，已使我們向民主憲政政的途程上　進了一大步。儘管横在面前的還有洶湧的波濤，而我們的必須邁步前進，則是任何困難所不能阻撓的，我戮力國事四十年，確信國父所親一凡事之應乎天理，順乎人心，合乎世界潮流與人羣需要，而爲先知先覺之士所決志行之者，則無不成」，這一句話實在是確切不移的眞理，因之，我願以誠摯堅定的信心，與我全國同胞和政府同人共同接受這一個救國，建國，實現民主的神聖使命，希望我全國賢俊和軍民同胞羣第羣力，一德一心，各竭其能，各盡其職，尤望對中正個人及新政府同人規過勸善，相勉相扶，爲中華民國的統一獨立與自由平等，奠立民主的良基，中正必以人民的意志爲意志，國家的利益為利益，博採衆議，盡忠職守，使我們行憲建國的任務違到完滿的成功。（完）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美蘇和談試探中的一幕插曲</h3>
<p>美蘇兩國在世界多處從事冷戰正打得火熱的時候，莫斯科突然發表了史密斯與莫洛托夫互相交換的文件，雙方都說要改善目前的美蘇關係，以直接談判的方式解決兩國間的一切糾紛；這個消息一經傳出之後，立即轟動了整個世界，世人英不以爲多難的世界又展開了一幕「柳暗花明又一邨」的遠景，但是觀於莫斯科發表此項文件，事前並未取得美國的同意，可知蘇聯此舉別有用心；再細讀史莫二氏交換的文件，更覺得美蘇對於雙方爭執的各項問題的論點，仍是針鋒相對，距離依然；接着杜魯門總統發表了一個修正聲明，史密斯再度致函莫洛托夫，馬歇爾國務卿亦鄭重聲明，美國無意與蘇聯單獨談判；於是世人因美蘇交換文件而引起的一串幻想，也就復歸於泡影了。</p>
<p>但是在這次和平試探中，却又發生了一幕微妙的插曲，這就是美國反對派第三領袖華萊士的致書史太林。這封「公開信」已於十三日發表，他要求美蘇雙方立即採取行動以制止「冷戰」，並主張召開公開會議確立今後百年內的和平大計；最後又提出一個關於和平解決美蘇意見分歧的具體方案，建議美蘇雙方採取下列步驟以結束兩國在世界各處所從事的「冷戰」：（一）普遍裁减軍備，禁用原子武器；（二）締結對日對德和約，並自德日兩國撤退駐軍；（三）從中國和朝鮮撤兵；（四）尊重各國之主權，及不干涉他國的內政；（五）禁止在聯合國會員國境內設置軍事基地；（六）以一切可能的方法發展國際貿易，並排除一切歧視辦法；（七）在聯合國機構內協助戰災各國經濟復興；（八）在世界各國中維護民主並保陣公民權利；（九）美蘇兩國公民·學生。記者，得在彼此國內自由行動，並恢復兩國科學情報之自由交換。…</p>
<p>這許多主張，是美國反對派領袖華萊士個人的意見，本來不値得過分重視；但是史太林忽然一破他平常的習慣，竟於十七日發表覆函，正面答覆華萊士的建議。他說史密斯大使的函件，僅表示美國懷有解決美蘇意見分歧的願望　已，並沒有更進一步的計劃；但是華萊士的公開信，却提供一個關於和平解決美蘇意見分歧的具體方案，可以作爲美蘇協　的基礎；最後史太林又擺足了蘇聯爭取和平的姿態，他說：「就蘇聯政府而言，它認爲華萊士的方案，可以作爲達成美蘇協調並謀國際合作發展的一種良好而有效的基礎。因爲蘇聯政府相信，儘管在經濟制度和意識形態方面有着分歧，而這些制度的並存以及美蘇意見分歧的和平解決，不僅是可能的；而且爲了普遍和平的利益，更是　對必要。』</p>
<p>我們不問華萊士的建議如何？史太林大捧華萊士，在正常的外交上是沒有先例的；但是史太林爲什麽要捧華萊士？明眼人一望而知，實有兩大目的：第一是蘇聯的和平攻勢，史太林的函覆華萊士，直接說明了蘇聯是要和平的，是願與美國和平談判解決問題；間接把這次和平談判失敗的責任完全諉諸美國。第二是對華萊士在美國國內以第三黨領袖競曰選總統作有力的捧塲，使美國一般希望循着和平途徑，用談判方式，消除美蘇間一切糾紛，以避免流血大戰的人民，都要擁護華萊士競選總統。</p>
<p>但是史太林的兩大目的能否完全實現？我們不能不從華萊士的建議中求得解答。華萊士的具體方案的要點，已如上述；在理論上聽來，的確是非常動人的，以此爲美蘇談判的基礎果能獲致美蘇兩國的協調，不要說美國人民完全贊成，就是美國政府也是樂觀其成的，史密斯大使致函莫洛托夫的動機，也就是在試探蘇聯對於和談是否有誠意，詎知莫洛托夫雖然也願與美國直接談判，但是蘇聯的觀點依然與美國針鋒相對，絕無妥協的餘地，因此使美國不得不放棄她直接談判的計劃，而改變主張要求蘇聯經由聯合國的機構，解決國際間所有的懸案，蘇聯爲側面發動和平攻勢起見，爰乃放棄外交途徑，而另覓蹊徑，由史太林函覆華萊士。但是世人的眼睛是雪亮的，在戰後的二三年之內，誰是眞正愛好和平？誰是在那裏阻撓和平？是一望而知的。過去的事實，眞是不勝枚舉，我們也不願舊事重提，即以華萊士所提出的幾點而論，其實並沒有觸及美蘇關係的核心；而且這些問題，都是美國外交當局所企求解決的，可是因為蘇聯意見的相左，以致陷於僵局迄今未能打開。誠如馬歇爾國務卿十九日向報界發表談話所謂：『西方國家企圖與蘇聯進行談判，以解決各項重要國際問題，曾作長時期之努力，但均未能獲致結果。』這些重要的國際問題，也就是華萊士所提出的各項主張。蘇聯沒有與美國談判的誠意，是昭然若揭的；史太林擺足爭取和平的姿勢，不待馬歇爾國務卿的揭破，我們早就看穿了。尤其是史太林至今還唱着共產主義與民主主義並存的高調，但自捷克政變發生以後，還有誰仍深信不疑呢？</p>
<p>我們每次論及蘇聯在冷戰中所採取的攻勢，總　蘇聯的手法高明，處處超人一等，尤其是這次史太林函覆華萊士，一方面表示：唯有蘇聯才是眞正愛好和平的國家；另一方面又捧足了華萊士的塲，可以增强他在美國的地位，誠可謂「一石兩鳥」了。但是這種掩耳盜鈴的手法，祗能欺騙無知的人民；但是在今日的美國，人民對於戰後國際局勢，都有相當的認識，決不會受人的欺騙，自我陶醉在和平之夢中。美國人民向來崇尙自由，尤其重視反對派的言論；但是對於反對派甘心爲外國人所利用，作爲對美攻勢的利器，決不會盲從附和的。所以史太林的手法，可能「弄巧成拙」，捧足了華萊士的塲，在華萊士本人或許會綏靖之不足，繼之以獻媚，甚至主張對蘇聯「無條件投降」；但其結果必然要使華萊士失去美國人民的同情與擁護，對於他競選總統祗有百害而無一利。</p>

<h3>用新人行新政　立法委員廿人發表共同談話　對新行政院長人選提供意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕立委陳芸田，陳海澄，楊幼炯，楊玉淸，楊德昭，杜光棋，張金鑑，宋述樵，李毓堯，王孟鄰，吳望伋，傅統先，李培天，劉階平，何佐治，駱啓運，吳劍平，吳道安，石宏規，許紹勤等鑒於首屆行政院長人選關係今後政治改革至大，特共同發表談話，提供意見，略謂：「十年以來行政首長多無一定的政策，祗知敷衍，從不注意到廣大民衆的要求，立法機關旣無從課其責任，監察機關的糾彈，亦往往置諸不理之列。今當行憲開始，對於主持行政大計的首腦人物，我們要求更新，反對換湯不換藥的辦法。今天全國人民正迫切的期待政治有一個澈底的改革，人民生活在高物價之下，已經喘不過氣來，希望代表人民的立法院能對未來的政治有一番新的變革，憲法上所賦予我們的同意權，自應爲適當的運川。我們雖不能對人事有若何的苛求，但歷來當政者的政治揹施有無錯誤，我們站在人民的立塲上，應加檢討，爲一新人民耳目起見，我們反對過去任何行政首長之無政績者再任未來的行政院長。　當前局勢非常艱巨，未來的行政院長，必須有針對環境需要，謀人民生活改善，並澈底革新政治的施政計劃，提出立法院。此項施政計劃，務須從解決迫切的實際問題爲入手，具體的列舉對於經濟措施，政治改革，乃至敎育文化各方面，規定實施程序，俾立法院得根據憲法第五十七條第一項之規定，請行政院長分期作施政報吿，而考核其政績。過去行政院長到任時施政方針之煌煌大文，無裨實際，在任期內又毫無表現，甚且誤國害民，亦無人課其責任，此爲多年來政治不能淸明之大原因。今爲正本淸源計，我們在同意行政院長任命之初，要特別檢討其施政的具體計劃，反對空洞的施政方針。</p>
<p>以上所陳，爲今後政治改革所關至大，謹此正吿國人，希一致主張。」</p>
<h3>陳納德聲明　否認再組飛虎隊</h3>

<p>陳氏否認稱：「余從未作任何表示有意組織或主持另一美國志願團，在華與共軍作戰，余可重由本人此次由美返滬後在五月七日記者招待會席間之談話：「吾不信中國在目前願接受任何外人參與對共軍作戰」。同時，必須再度聲明，余從未主張美軍實地參加中國內戰，余僅表示中國將歡迎美國在技術上之敎練或顧問，但本人亦未被邀請作任何顧問」。</p>
<p>陳氏繼稱：美國與中國在今日之準備，很明顯的，較一九四一年時完善，美國是否參與中國內戰，並非本人之事，此事當由中美最高當局決定之，本人不願作紙上談兵。渠復聲明其現已正式退伍，目前主特空運大隊，在中國境內運輸救濟及復興物資，輸送糧食至受戰爭毁損之區，以原料運至丙地使恢復工業，並將中國產品運至各口岸，俾出口爭取外匯，本人認爲此工作極有價値，故將繼續進行之。</p>
<p>最後陳氏又謂：該報記者前尙提出余所不能答復之右關軍事問題。對於中國空軍及其配備，本人自有意見，此意見曾在華府秘密提交有關當局，但在未至適當時期，或未經負責人發表前，余對所提數字仍將保守機密。</p>

<h3>總統對五院行文辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕關於總統對五院行文，及提名同意後任命之官員發表方式，業由國府文官處擬且辦法四項，提出昨（十九日）末次國務會議報吿，茲誌該辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）大總統對立法院行文擬用咨。按立法院係由人民選舉之立法委負組織而成，其院長副院長復由委負互選，不經總統任命。又憲法第卅九條及七十二條內載，立法院通過總統執行之案件，係用「移請或移送」字樣。至憲法第四十三，第五十五，第六十九各條，則明定總統送立法院之案祗用「提交」及「咨請」字樣。基於（上述條文，立法院與總統間行文，擬即以咨行之。</p>
<p>（二）總統對監察院行文擬亦用咨。按監察院係由各省市議會及蒙古西藏地方，華僑團體分別選出之監察委員組織而成，其委員之選舉雖屬間接，而其性質則略同於立法委員之選舉，且其院長副院長之互選，一如立法院，與司法院院長副院長，考試院院長副院長均由總統提名經監察院同意而後任命，及與行政院院長須由總統提經立法院同意而後任侖者不同，是以監察院與總統間行文，擬照立法院之例用咨。</p>
<p>（三）總統對行政，司法，考試三院行文擬均用令。行政，司法，考試三院院長及司法，考試兩院副院長，均由總統提名任命，與立法監察兩院院長副院長之由委員互選者不同，故總統對該三院擬均用令。</p>
<p>五院地位原屬相等，現總統對立法，監察兩院用咨，對行政，司法，考試三院則用令，有失平衡，但憲法規定如此，似不能悉從舊制。</p>
<p>（四）除依泌法產生之行政院院長及司法，考試二院院長及大法官等，須經立法院或監察院同意後任命，以前所用之選任方式已不適合，此後擬改用「提任」二字，以示與特任有別。</p>

<h3>參院外交委員會贊同　美參加集體安全制　一切以聯合國憲章為依歸</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十九日電〕參院外委會本日一致通過一項決議案，其中在原則上贊成在聯合國憲章之適當規定之範圍內，美國參與區域與集體安全措置。該項決議案，係以上星期中該委會主席范登堡所發表之工作報吿書為基礎。該決議案並核准美國可採取行動。與各國覓致自願訂立之協定，俾使安理會中之否決權，對於一切牽涉和平解決爭端以及准許聯合國新會員國入會之問題，槪不適用。在該方而修改大國否決權之建議，曾由美國向聯大會臨時委員會提出。該項決議案獲得國務院之贊成，並與國務卿馬　爾及美駐聯合國首席代表奧斯汀所表示之見解相符合。馬歇爾與奧斯汀最近在衆院外委會作證時，曾堅決反對在此時改變聯合國憲章。按衆院外委會亦在硏究聯合國之組織問題。范登堡稱，至少在兩星期內此項決議案大致不致向參院全會提出，促請考慮。衆院外委會就增强聯合國之建議廣泛聽取意兌，而於星期二舉行秘密會議，起草有關該委會見解之聲明。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美參院外委會今日一致通過一項決議案，此案可試驗蘇聯是否願意在聯合國內採取行動以支持和平會議。該案係由外委會主席范登堡所提出，將呈請杜魯門總統以全力促使聯合國有更多工具而較少之否決權。此項決議案主張限制五强在安理會不涉及運用武裝部隊之決議方面之否決權，主張美國援助在聯合國憲章範圍內以自助爲根據之集體安全聯盟，並籲總統致力於世界和平軍之組織及附有防止違犯之限制軍備條例。范登堡鄭重指出，此項決議之目的，並不針對蘇聯或任何其他强國，但蘇聯素爲修改聯合國憲章最堅決之反對者，美國欲促成此項修改之行動，將顯示蘇聯最近「和平攻勢」之眞僞。該法案並不束縛總統，亦不一定須提交衆院，但如參衆兩院以壓倒優勢質成此議，則杜魯門殊難加以反對。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕聯合國美首席代表奧斯汀今日在全國社會科學研究院年會席上發表演說，奧斯汀并謂，「蘇聯有當面及不斷之機會，以表示其在和平方面與美合作之願望」。渠繼稱，世界僅需要蘇聯之合作，以保障世界免於受原子毁滅之威脅，此爲需要解決之主要點，不能由美蘇雙方進行談判以解決之，必須在聯合國內與其他會員國合作之下予以解決」。</p>
<h3>共產黨擾亂歐洲均勢　英決不袖手坐視　貝文外相演說警告蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔路透社約克郡史加城二十日電〕貝文外相今日在此間工然年會中發表演說，警吿蘇聯以當歐洲不能自主地傾向於極權主義的一邊時，英國決不能持袖手旁觀的能度。貝文係於大會辯論政府之外交政策時發表政府之外交方針。工黨左翼議員齊里亞克斯於辯論時，曾猛烈抨擊政府之外交，貝文聲言渠並無意變更俄人對共產主義的信仰，俄人如願共產主義不干英國之事，毌庸英國囑其變更信仰。但歐洲對共產主義之態度，乃另一截然不同的事，英國決不容共產少數黨違背人民的意志而擾亂歐洲的均勢。</p>
<p>共產主義固無妨逗留蘇聯國界以內，但決不能再事搗亂歐洲的局勢。渠希望蘇聯目前已能認淸西方世界已抱有不容捷克悲劇重演的決心。先是齊里亞克斯猛烈抨擊政府在國際關係的各方而慘遭失敗，渠不得不指出世界目前的不安，大多係因英國工黨無固定政策之故，渠特別要求撤回駐希臘之英軍，他說，除非英國願意使人以爲英國正在干涉他國內政，政府實無一繼續派駐軍隊在希臘的理由。</p>
<h3>美衆院通過　反共產法案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美衆院十九日以壓倒優勢之票數，通過　特德尼克遜法案，任令美共黨取捨於與草斯科脫離關係或送入監獄二者之間。衆院於消除削弱此項措施，或將此案退回非美活動委會等一切企圖後，以三一九對五八票之口頭表決通過此案。此項法案現將提交參院討論，將以美國歷史上從未加於一政治團體之最苛酷之決議，加以美共黨及其「陣綫」組職。在衆院內四日之劇烈辯論中，該法案曾被斥爲非憲法的，將形成「思想管制」及危害一切美人之個人自由。但該案將在參院遭遇困難之奮鬥，且杜魯門總統曾表示，該案於提呈總統簽署時，渠將予以否決。</p>
<h3>英促歐洲團結　使成為和平橋樑</h3>
<p>〔路透社約克郡史加城十九日電〕工黨執委會業已接受工黨黨員勃魯克威在工黨年會中所提一項決議案，其中要求政府促進歐洲國家間及亞菲兩洲被解放民族的更緊密團結。決議案聲明，「工黨全體大會對建立東西强國集團的趨勢，深感驚異，並信保守黨所主張根據資本主義及與美國締結軍事同盟爲基礎而組織西歐聯盟之觀念，匪特不能解決歐洲的經濟問題，且將引起第三次世界大戰。勃魯克威指出邱吉爾希望歐洲與亞菲民族樹立帝國主義的關係，而工黨則願意歐洲與亞菲被解放民族間的團結。邱吉爾則願歐洲成爲美蘇戰爭中的前綫，而工黨則願歐洲成爲東西間和平的橋樑。</p>
<h3>芬醖釀政潮　內長遭議會彈劾</h3>
<p>〔合衆社赫爾　基二十日電〕芬蘭議會二十日以八十一對六十票彈劾芬蘭共黨主腦之一內長李安諾，根據芬蘭憲法，李氏應立即辭職。僉信議會之彈劾將產生政潮共籍總理貝卡拉亦將引咎辭職。彈劾案係保守黨領袖薩明嫰於十九日提出，激辯至深夜始獲通過。李氏被控不經內閣授權，擅自於一九四五年將芬蘭十人外國人十名自蘇　引渡入境。李氏則辯稱，渠被蘇聯管制團所迫而出此。李氏以內長名議控制保安警，曾有人控以安插共然入警局以爲芬共之助。</p>
<h3>聖地東北綫劇戰　猶軍在迦列里海南發動反攻　耶城阿猶軍已短兵相接</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿日廣播：華盛頓訊，埃及陸軍發表公報稱：埃軍佔領蘇奈特與皮爾許巴兩城，並急速向台拉維夫推進。此外，保衛耶路撒冷之猶太軍，繼遭阿拉伯軍團猛攻，失却若干陣地，聖城在砲轟之下，名蹟頗有被燬於砲火者。</p>
<p>〔路透社台拉維夫二十日電〕阿拉伯國軍與以色列軍，已在巴勒斯坦東北部迦列里海南端發生大規模接戰，以色列軍已自迦列里海東南十五哩處之交通中心貝森城，向北以扇形姿態推進，對正向該處猶太農業區推動之伊拉克及叙利亞部隊發動反攻。</p>
<p>該地猶太區昨竟夜遭遇阿拉伯飛機之轟炸。六架編隊之阿拉伯飛機分批轟炸及掃射約但河流域巴勒斯坦最老的猶太移民區達根雅，從未經歷戰爭之猶太農民，在哈迦那基指導下，居然亦已在戰綫後方掘壕佈防，稍北迦列里海南端之薩馬格城附近，猶阿兩軍亦有短距離的接戰。</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅二十日電〕埃國防部公報宣布，埃軍已佔領迦薩以北十公里之狄爾史奈，並證實東路埃軍已佔領迦薩東南三十哩通至耶城公路上之皮爾許巴。</p>
<p>〔合衆社台拉維夫二十日電〕阿猶兩軍短兵相接，爭奪耶路撒冷，據報，舊城中二十日發生大火多起，英方稱，由於砲隊及臼砲之轟擊，基督敎之中心，西方國家心嚮往之神聖地方，已成一片修羅塲。耶城內之戰爭，因阿猶雙方檢查新聞甚嚴，故報導不明，然無論何方得勝，此一古城向非經過有史以來第十九次之重建不可。猶太人士承認該區　戰正酣，猶阿雙方均增援決一死戰。各建築物中正逐室展開肉搏戰。阿方宣稱，新舊兩城之猶軍均已全部被圍。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕叙利亞軍宣布，已佔領巴勒斯坦邊界之薩馬格城及車站，及附近各要塞，哈迦那亦已承認。</p>
<h3>英記者陣亡</h3>

<h3>對英施用壓力　迫阿退出聖地</h3>
<p>美議員向衆院提出主張</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十日電〕紐約州民主黨議員賽勒，昨在衆議院中聲言，除非馬歇爾國務卿能迫使英國將外約但之阿拉伯軍團自巴勒斯坦撤退，渠將提出法案，停止以馬歇爾方案下的援助供給英國，渠謂，阿拉伯軍團之侵入耶路撒冷，可由貝文外相一言以制止之，如果美國願意，貝文即可令此等阿拉伯「戰爭之狗」退出，相信英國必不敢繼續從事美國所不同意的事。</p>
<h3>南韓臨時議會解散　李承晚籲請美軍繼續留駐</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城二十日電〕南韓五月十日大選旣已選出國民議會代表二百人，南韓協時議會已於今日解散。按臨時議會於一九四六年十二月十二日開始成立，至今通過法案九十三件。議員原爲七十人，然期間一人被暗殺，數人病歿，多人集體辭職，致今日之閉幕儀式，出席者僅四十九人。</p>

<h3>美考慮修改　中東軍火禁運令</h3>
<p>馬歇爾對記者宣布</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾十九日在記者招待會中談稱，美國現仍在考慮修改關於目前禁運軍火赴中東事美國應否採取行動之問題。但在美國獲　對於美國最近向安理會所提宣佈巴勒斯坦情勢足以威脅世界和平之建議，安理會究竟採取何種態度之前美國對此將不作任何決定。</p>
<h3>認美聲明矛盾　蘇聯表驚異</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十九日電〕塔斯社今夜發表公報，綜述蘇聯各領袖對於美國務部昨晚向報界所作聲明之意見稱，史達林雖非向美政府提出正式建議，渠五月十七日所發表之文件，僅係答覆美第三黨總統候選人華萊士之公開函，但美國務部認爲實有就史達林答覆向報界作一特別聲明之必要。國務部一方面承認史達林文件之重要性，及爲和平解決有關世界和平各項問題之必要，但在另一方面又謂史達林覆函中所包括之具體問題，不能成爲美蘇直接談判之議題。如與其他各國共同商討此等問題，諸如原子能管制問題，及外長會議中之若干問題，又因蘇聯持相反態度而致毫無成就。此間人士獲悉國務部之此種聲明後，甚感驚異。</p>
<h3>美強制聖地停戰提案　中英均表示反對　美堅持安理會採取有力行動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿日廣播：成功湖訊，安理會本日聽取巴勒斯坦休戰委會報吿，後者力促安理會採取堅强行動，迫使猶阿雙方就範，任何建議性質之行動，殊難收效，阿方態度，尤爲强破。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十九日電〕中·英兩國今日均在聯合國安全理事會反對美。蘇提議强制巴勒斯坦停戰。中國代表蔣廷黻稱，中國政府碍難贊成美國提案。</p>
<p>美國主張由分治而達到和平，但中國始終認爲必須為致猶太與阿拉伯雙方均可接受之解決方案。聯合國機構與其强硬而欠公正，不如軟弱而公正。中國堅持公正解決該一問題之立塲。同時英代表賈德幹則建議由安理會再度籲請猶太阿拉伯雙方停戰，並飭令巴勒斯坦停戰委會繼續斡旋。賈氏稱，聯合國如果採用制裁手段或派兵彈壓，英政府不敢苟同，蓋因聯合國機構並無軍隊。美代表奧斯汀立即起而反對，堅持原案，援用聯合國憲章第七條對於侵略國實施最緊急處分。奧氏稱，安理會籲請雙方停戰，迄無效果，現應採取更有力之行動。英美兩國對於巴勒斯坦問題之裂痕已漸確定，預料美國提案不免失敗。</p>
<h3>屈拉普代表團所提建議　違反遠委會政策　我賠償代表團長吳半農談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿日電〕我國賠償及歸還代表團長吳半農今稱：屈拉普代表團所建議，「只有日政府所擁有之兵工廠中，主要戰爭工業設備始可撥充賠償」一節，勢將完全推翻遠東委會之基本對日政策，吳氏指出此項報吿，爲「武斷專横而缺乏事實及數字之根據」。吳氏稱：此項建議報吿如經採納，日本勢將獲得重工業之基礎，而易改裝爲戰爭工業。渠並指出遠東委會規定主要戰爭工業不但應包括有日政府所擁有之陸海軍兵工廠，而應包有飛機製造及私有軍火工廠。吳氏稱：約翰斯頓較斯揣克持吿尤進一步，蓋其甚至建議將飛機製造廠及私有軍火工廠自賠償單上剔除也。約翰斯頓實際上不僅建議保存日本戰爭潛力，而且建議保留日本戰爭工業，此顯與遠東委會之對日基本政策大相逕庭，蓋遠東委會之對日政策，係明白宣示「日本軍事實力之現有經濟基礎，必須予以摧毁，前不准其有重起之餘地。」吳氏繼稱：在企圖保存日本飛機製造廠及私有軍火工廠方面，實無任何理由可言。</p>
<h3>杜魯門要求國會　撥款助日韓復興</h3>
<p>總數一億五千萬美元</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬廿日電〕義外部今日透露：義政府曾向駐羅馬英美蘇大使館及南斯拉夫公使館送致照會，要求四强對義南兩國國界進行明確之釐定。該照會指斥南斯拉夫政府在目前臨時之國界綫上一再破壞及引起糾紛，造成困難局勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿日電〕義大利政府因降落於羅馬及西西里之外國飛機六架，有飛往巴勒斯坦之嫌疑，乃於廿日加以扣留。羅馬烏倍機塲人員稱，飛機三架十八日晚自法境尼斯抵此，擬將飛布林迭西，而布城適爲義大利通希臘及聖地之出發點。另三機則於十八日晚降落於西西里之加泰尼亞。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾聲明要點　列舉十一項國際重要問題　證明蘇絕無覓取解決誠意</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕國務部今日對史達林之接受華萊士列舉之各點，作爲美蘇歧見之基礎，提出答覆。馬歇爾强調聲明世界今日所急需者，爲蘇聯政府採取的具體而補救的行動，惟有根據此等行動，始能表示史達林元帥且有解決兩國歧見的誠意。</p>
<p>國務部並列舉十一項國際重要問題，實際上皆因蘇聯之阻撓，致未能成立協議：</p>
<p>（一）「裁减軍備」自一九四六年以來，此事迄尙在聯合國安理會裁軍委員會之硏究中。</p>
<p>（二）「原子能」聯合國原子能委會之官員均指責蘇聯波蘭及烏克蘭，阻撓國際管制原子能有效協定之成立。聯合國機構今尙面臨國際管制原子能之問題，美政府仍準備參加任何眞正有效的管制。</p>
<p>（三）「德國和約問題」英美法所提每一建議，幾悉遭蘇聯之反對，此乃阻止一切進展的原因。</p>
<p>（四）「日本和約問題」美國已曾建議召開十一國會議，起　對日和約，在會中採用三分之二多數表決制，然蘇聯則堅持須由外長會議處理此事。中國雖贊成召開十一國會議，但主張由四强保留對一切決議的否決權，迄至目前爲止，對此等距離甚遠的意見尙無法解決</p>
<p>（五）「撤退駐華軍隊事」目前在中國境內僅有美陸軍一。四九六名，及美海軍與陸戰隊四·一」一五名。</p>
<p>（六）「朝鮮問題」聯合國大會已於去歲通過對朝鮮之計劃，然蘇聯竟不許聯合國朝鮮委會進入北韓，蘇聯匪特拒絕合作以執行聯合國之計劃，且復企圖片面施行其自身的計劃，其結果足以引起朝鮮之內戰。</p>
<p>（七）「尊重他國主權及不干涉內政事」此事範圍甚廣，但美蘇兩國之行動，可交與輿論裁判。</p>
<p>（八）「軍事基地問題」聯合國大會前此已曾議決會員國在其他會員國駐紮軍隊，須獲得後者自由而公開表示的同意。美國與被駐兵國所成立之協定，均已呈報聯合國機構。此外美國並已曾向安理會建議凡由安理會指揮之一切武裝部隊，有不受限制的過境權及使用各處基地的權利，但蘇聯別對此議表示拒絕。</p>
<p>（九）「國際貿易問題」蘇聯對於日內瓦及哈伐那兩會均拒絕參加。</p>
<p>（十）「協助戰災國問題」美國經由聯合國或其他途徑對全世界他國所供給之援助，堪爲對於此點之適當答覆。</p>
<p>（十一）「人權問題」聯合國人權委會正在起草關於保障人權的宣言及公約，美蘇旣均爲該會委員，不解尙能以何種其他方法處理人權問題。</p>

<h3>中央核減汽車用油　市付貼補存油　本月尚無影響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央對本市汽車及工廠用汽油，每月均係定量分配，四月份共爲一百八十一萬加倫。自五月份起，中央减少本市配量至一百四十九萬六千三百五十加倫。本市五月份汽車用油，原將按比例减少，現因市府尙有一部份存油用以塡補，故五月份汽車用油仍照原配量配給，自六月份起，則按比例酌量减少。</p>

<h3>外匯牌價與黑市相云太遠　猪鬃業籲請救濟　外滙政策不變出口商勢將崩潰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市豬　出口業昨日招待記者，詳陳該業及一般出口業今日之痛苦，指出由於外匯牌價與黑市相去太遠，出口商結匯所得之國幣，絕不能購買原有數量之貨物、致本市七八百家出口行家，存貨日减，處境困難，此種外匯政策如不改變，則全部出口業至多再能維持兩三月，終將趨於崩潰之一途。而在此低外匯政策之下，走私者日眾，以豬鬃一項而論，走私至香港者動輒以數百噸計。政府上月份之出口外匯收入，僅一千餘　美元，而本月份之出口外匯收入，恐至多五百萬美元。出口業如一旦崩潰，後果頗爲嚴重，蓋有出口方能有進口如無出口外匯之收益以支付進口必需品之代價，則入口必需品激减，勢必物價飛漲，民生不安。該業決乘政府改組，百事刷新之際，向政府提出具體建議兩項：（一）政府今後可規定某種商品之是否許可進口，而不問進出口之外匯率。（二）如此點實行有困難時，亦請政府依據法幣與美元之實際購買力，重訂合理之匯率。以上兩點爲挽救出口業之治本方法。至於救急方面，則希望（一）打句押款，至少展期限爲二個月。（二）五月底出口之貨其外匯於出口時，希望延期一個月結匯，並照售得之外幣，先　掛牌價十足借款。（三）猪鬃製造過程，需時三個月以上，希望政府給予生產貸款，澈底增加滛量，以便爭取外匯，該項貸款保證於三個月後以結售外匯之款蹄還本息。</p>

<p>食油　漲勢已較平和，因到貨稍增，不乏出戶。靑島吉生油砌五萬，豆油廠方開似不低，惟散戶胃口已不濃，大有餘豆油一千四百二十萬，略升二十萬之譜。生菜油加二十萬，熱菜油漲六七十萬平車蔴油挺五十萬，豆餅　加四五萬，然無實銷，後市回退，終略砌萬元左有。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市况，以迎日上漲已鉅，客帮辦胃轉懈，多頭在吐出，市氣告平。四十二支藍鳳細紗初開價尙挺俏，嗣因業中銀根仍緊，散戶斬售，回低至二億八千八百萬元。臨收時浮空抵補，終以二億　千萬元收盤，比上日回跌二百萬。廿一支雙馬紗初開躍升三百萬元，旋爲抬而帮拋售，本街去化呆頓，結果軋降五百萬元。此外惟十支童子軍及金寶星紗，因實銷戶略進市價獨升一二百萬。其他各支粗細紗均回挫一二百萬至四五百萬左右。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因傳外商銀行又有大批美鈔拋出，央行繼續抽緊銀佷天一帮因匯款不及到氾，將餘拋甚夥，山門幫與染廠甚鮮進出，布商則乘高出檔，塲內賣氣轉濃，十二磅龍頭細布開後曾上竄二十萬元，後經金融帮及布商一味吐售，狂瀉至六百五十二萬元，迨至收時，空方獲利抵補，行情回好至六百六十萬元收市、較上日回小五萬元。塲外則軋降二十餘萬，但收後斬售不絕，喊價步小至六百五十五萬元有人脫手。其餘各細布及嗶嘰，亦均下挫。惟粗布細斜及士林布市見步是二十萬至四十萬元不等</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨全面開售花紗布，售出各品價格種類，數量，有如後開：</p>
<p>（甲）棉花：（一）火機九五〇祖，每祖二六〇〇萬元。（二）通州粗絨五七四〇蹟，每担二六八〇萬元。（丙）南太倉花一三〇〇蹟，每担二六四〇萬元。以上共售七九〇〇担。</p>
<p>（乙）棉紗：廿支水月一八二〇〇萬元，大發，醒獅，五子，一七五〇〇萬元，雙喜，金雙獅一七八〇〇萬元，紅蜂一七〇〇〇萬元，六支副日光九千萬元，十支豐年一〇五〇〇萬元，卅二支雙股仙桃二五〇〇〇萬元，四〇支日光二三二〇〇萬元，四二支雙股立馬二八三〇〇萬元，四二支雙股藍鳳二八五〇〇萬元，以上共售八六九件，共計收入價款一七，六三六，九〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>（丙）棉布；共售布三二九六〇疋，被單一八〇條，零頭布八一〇〇磅，申購單共六九〇張，內除廠商三十張，購布四九八〇疋外，餘悉屬各布號所購。</p>
<h3>低價配給生絲　廠商準備申請</h3>
<p>工繳過昂尙有顧慮</p>
<p>自輪管會公佈由政府以每磅美金三元半之低價配給生絲原料，俾絲織業以成品供應外銷，換取更多外匯辦怯後，織造廠商多已準備辦理申請。唯尙有躊躇，其原因以國內工繳太昂，約佔成本百分之六十三，參照國外市價製成品運銷國外時，必致虧耗。依照當局先撥生絲二百擔之數量，假定全部織成雙縐十四萬碼，即須損失四萬二千美元之鉅。據業中人分析丙容稱；照規定生絲以每磅三元半售予廠商，每擔合美元四百六十五元五角，以現行官價結匯，等於法幣兩億一千八百八十萬元，如以之織造關四十寸之雙縐，每匹用絲七斤（即九磅半）即合法幣一千五百三十一萬四千元，外加工繳及一切準備開支，每碼爲三十五萬元。每匹計五十碼，等於法幣一千七百五十萬元，兩共三千二百八十一萬四千元，亦即每匹七〇美元，每碼一元四角美元，按目前海外市價每碼僅值美元一元一角，紐約交貨CIF.N.Y每匹僅售美金五十五元，相差十五美元。照初步精確計算，生絲二百擔，織成變縐十四萬碼，其損失約四萬二千美元。雙繳預計如此，其他成品不難推算。政府所定絲價三元五角美元，朱免過高。而工資部份亳無貼補，依現在生活指數之高，欲求配合美國綢貨市價，尙惑困難。惟索商鑒於政府提倡出口之美意，力求减低成本，縱無利可圖，業在加緊籌劃試行出口，以爭取外匯云。</p>
<h3>華股疲途盤旋　統倩洋股不振</h3>
<p>華股昨顧忌甚多，銀根狀態不利多方，驟告回小。散戶再度　羽，近午最疲，後市經過長時期之徘徊後，臨收稍堅。</p>
<p>晨初人心因銀根恐怖，加以總統就職，亦多顧忌而趨疲。永紗開二八三〇元低盤，開後進至二八七〇元，旋即跌至二七六五元，再升爲二八〇五元，代辦費開四〇元及四四元原價，七七號等連續賣出，銀根更緊，午後跌至二七一五元。較前收計統益火柴中泥跌一成，永公勤興閘北新華微挫，餘均跌半成左右。</p>

<p>外股　昨成交不暢，查帳工作仍有，集會較遲，延至十一時後始有成交。怡紗晨開五〇一萬，高價不過五〇三萬，低至四八〇萬，而後始穩。臨收時在四九五萬左右掙扎，與前收相較計怡紗雖跌而較微。英聯會德豐怡啤航業跌半成，業廣紙版鋼業下降一成左有。</p>
<p>公債　昨疲軟不振，成交約三百萬左右。統丙量開二四萬，自二四萬六退至二三萬一而後稍平。較前收計甲乙丙跌落八千元，丁戊各項一萬一。</p>
<h3>絲綢均回落</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市開盤即告挫降，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午先降至三億八千六百萬元左右，午收即期升至九千二百萬元，隔日期做九千六百萬元，下午收盤價九千五百萬元，最後塲外又低至九千二百萬元，結果比上日短一千三百萬元之譜。</p>

<h3>土荘珍眉佈樣</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，本年度土莊溫州珍眉，佈樣者雖絡繹不絕，但减價再度上砌，每祖高達一千四百萬元，而出口商終嫌價奇昂，態度仍取束手，致過程依然岑靜。其他花色，進出各猶趦趄，交易平庸非凡。至於紅綠茶內銷，天津各地續乏生氣，餘如本街店莊等，尙有零星添納。價格方面，執主亦頻加扳售，惟臨收結果，除存底將啟之卅年祁門紅茶，迂廻挺進外，他若本年度新龍井等，一致原途盤旋。</p>
<h3>行局差進再破記録　總額共碇五零零九億元</h3>

<h3>僑匯收入逐月遞減</h3>
<p>據中國銀行消息，本年度以來，僑匯之收入，日有减少。一月份僑匯收入之總數爲六百〇八億四千四百萬餘元，二月份即减至三百億〇九千餘萬元，較之一月份减少三百〇七億餘元。三月份爲二百九十三億七千八百餘萬元，較之二月份又减少七億一千二百餘萬元。四月份之僑匯收入總數尙在統計中，計算中尙較三月份爲低。倘以目前之美匯基準價計算，每月僑匯僅可收入六萬餘美元，爲歷年來最少之數字。該行國外部負責人表示：目前外匯之市價，根本已與黑市價格脫節。僑匯之收入，非調整匯率之力量，可以挽回。僑匯亦爲國家外匯收入最大來源之一，政府外匯收支無法平衡時，僑匯收支又無法補助，外匯之政策實有改善之必要云。</p>

<h3>教部劉參事發表談話　說明私校立案標準　規定開辦經常等費僅及戰前十萬倍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕教部因廿日京報載少數未立案私中校長，爲教部近頒私校立案標準所訂開辦經常各費數目太大，擬日內赴立院請願，要求减低，修改規程等語，特由參事劉英士向記者談稱：現時物價指數，約較戰前高出六十萬倍，京滬區公教人員生活指數已調整至三十一萬倍，但私校之開辦經常等費，至今仍爲戰前標準十萬倍，故在現時辦私校所需籌撥經費，依物價指教計算，僅及戰前六分之一，此與各私校對學生收費標準相較，可稱所差尙遠，而少數未立案私校校長，尙擬要求减低，可見其對校會設備及員生福利，殊不注意。主管機關，對此等要求，未便予以考慮。又規程或為部頒，或由政院核定，照例不經立法程序。</p>

<h3>漫淡人體之發熱</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>我們火家對於人體之發熱普通總以爲是一種病態。其實發熱「究竟是不是一種病能？」「發熟之意義究竟爲何？」我們大家即未必完全明白。因此我特地揀了這個題目來談談，好教人家對於人體發熱能够得着一種新概念。</p>
<p>我們要曉得，我們人類的體溫是絕對有其移動性的。普通在正常的　　狀態中它在腋下的測量是攝氏表的卅六度至卅七度．它在一日之中的差別也只在攝氏表的六分左右。但是假使把它在肛門或口腔內測量呢，那末雖則在正常的生現狀態中（而且在休息的情形中）它也有攝氏表三分或至五分的增高狀態。據去年出版的賀萊氏（Holler）內科臨床病態診斷學內刊載，一個生理正常的人在劇烈運動之後它在肛門內所測驗的體溫可以昇高至攝氏表卅九度，同時若在腋下測量則其體溫只有幾分的昇高而己。而且若令被測驗者於休息一小時後再行測驗，那末它的體溫又恢復到普通平常的狀態了。這種運動之後發生的熱度我們稱它爲「工作熱」Arbeitshyperthermie。不過，上述的工作熱是要有一種正常的體溫調節機構　能發生的。這種體溫調節機構共有兩種性能，一種是熱度的製造，另一種就是熱度的放散。熱度的製造是藉血液內和組織內的養化作川在化學方面的演變中產生的。而熱度的放散呢，那就大半屬於物理方面的作用了。上述這兩種性能是絕對被控制於神經中樞的熱度調節機關，應熱應冷，隨時受其調節。根據無數的生物實驗和臨床研究（例如在腦內之某處用針穿刺立即發生熱度之反應等等），我們現在已經曉得調節熟度的神經中樞是在問腦附近，尤其是在灰白結節（Tuber　cinereum）和綫形隆起物（Corpus　striatum日）之間。這處的調節熟度神經中樞是藉着交惑神經和副交感神經的傳播來惑受着肢體各處的冷熱刺激而發揮它的調節本能。此外，內分泌系的機體對於熱度的調節也有很大的關係。其中之甲狀腺，間腦下垂腺以及副腎腺等對於熟度的調節關係更其重大，例如甲狀腺分泌增高時，不但新陳代謝因之提高即其熟度亦隨之增高所以患甲狀腫大症者往往有輕微熱度。又如甲狀腺割去或則甲狀腺分泌减低之後其體溫隨即降低，手足時常冰冷，用體溫表加以測驗，則體溫常在攝氏表卅六度左右。我們又在副腎腺患者方面也有同樣的臨床經驗，凡是息副腎腺機能失調的人都有很低的體溫，手足時常發冷，它的新陳代謝工作也同時减低。反之，假如一個抦人忽然患着副腎臟腺出血症，那末他就有高度的發熟，有如患着一種很　劇的傳染病。我們曾經用手術將某種動物的副腎腺割去，結果這個動物就永遠不會發熱而且在體溫的逐漸低降中於數日內死亡。雖則用針穿刺它的問腦（請參看上文），它也不會再有發熟的感應了。可見甲狀腺和副臂腺對於熱度的調節都有很大的關係。此外我們也可以用副腎腺素（Adreualin）刺激一個人或一個動物發熱。總而言之，我們體內的熱度調節機能一部份是在大腦內的間腦而另一部則在內分泌的腺體內。倘使上述的兩所部份發生病態，那末體溫就　其常態而發生種種病症了。</p>
<p>在各種病症之發熱情况中，當然是熱度調節機能發生障碍所致·但是，這種障碍究竟如何發生，則有待於我人之研究。根據臨床實驗所得，在發熱的情形中病者血液內的化學成份必定發生變化，因之刺繳熱度調節機構使之工作異常地增加而成爲病態之發熱。在許多的病態發熱情形中當然以大腦部份最容易感受刺繳而發生機能方面之障碍。例如間腦附近的癌睡以及腦炎腦梅毒之類都可以有很高的熟度。不過，大多數的病態發熟都是由於血液內病態化學物質的刺激（例如細菌所分泌的毒質以及異體蛋白質等等）。此外如化學性的物質在體內被吸收或則在體內發其，用時，往往也有高熱發生，辟如Atropin,Cocaiu,Adreualin可以使人發熱。我們醫師或許可以遇着一個心臟病患者，給了强心劑毛地黃之後忽然發熟，不知其中原故其實就是毛地黃在專頭作怪呢。</p>
<p>不過，我也得加以說則，有許多人根本就是沒有病症的，假如它的體內熱度無從放　（例如窗戶開閉太緊或則衣服穿着太多），那末也可以有很高的熱度，這是不足爲慮的。還有，我也得補充幾句，就是：患神經　　或則希司脫利定的人在神經病態發作時往往也有頗高的熱度，這也是不足偽慮的。</p>
<p>至於禛正屬於病症的發熱呢，那就多半是傳染病性的發熱了。這個對於我們的防護和療治都有很大的關係。關於這種發熱的形式和所類我們可以很詳細地把它敘述出來。不過，因爲篇輻的關係，而且其他專著中也有詳細的論述，所以我也不再　述了。</p>
<h3>種痘常識</h3>
<p>— 吳軼羣</p>
<p>近來上海天花流行，我想所有做父母的，沒有不祖心他們的兒女，恐怕也傳染這種重則送命，輕則變成「麻皮」的惡疾的。同時自然也會想到帶他們去種牛痘，不過一般人對於種牛痘的基本常識，却很模糊，常常發生許多疑問、最普通的有下列機種：</p>
<p>（一）小兒出生後從何時起，才能及必須開始種痘？、</p>
<p>（二）種痘是否每年要施行一次？</p>
<p>（三）種痘並未發庖，是否需要續種？</p>
<p>（四）小孩曾出天花，要種牛痘否？</p>
<p>（五）家中已有小孩一人出天花，他孩應否種痘）預防？</p>
<p>（六）小孩患病，可種牛痘否？</p>
<p>（七）小孩生疥瘡或濕氣，（濕疹或類似皮膚病之俗稱）可種牛痘否？</p>
<p>（八）成人幼時曾患天花或種牛痘，須再種否？</p>
<p>要解答這些問題，必須對於種痘免疫的原理，有相當的瞭解，才能辦到。天花是一種傳染病，人們經過一次患病後，身體中便會產生一種抵抗天花病毒的物質，使身體在第二次同牠接觸時，能與之抵抗而消除之，使牠不致損害身體而患病，這種物質，叫做抗體。據一般經驗，患過一次天花的人，便可借抗體之助，終身不致再被傳染就是說，可以獲得終身免疫。</p>
<p>但是醫學上有一種寶貴的發現，人們不一定要染了很厲害的天花，才能獲得這種抗體。只須人工的用天花病毒在皮膚上作局部的接種，同樣的亦可使身體產生足够的抗體，而獲得免疫的效果·不過這種免疫，只能保持相當的時日，若干年後，（最多五年至十年）抗體便會逐漸减少，以至完全消失，那時對於天花的感染性，便同未種牛痘的人，一般無二了。</p>
<p>牛痘苗就是天花病毒，不過係經過一次將牠種在牛身上，從牛身上的天花瘡庖內抽出，使牠毒性大爲减少罷了。（經過在牛身上接種，天花病毒的毒性，便大爲减低，也是醫學上一種寶貴的發現。）這樣，我們將　毒性輕微的天花病毒「牛痘苗」，種在人類身上，便得到兩種效果：（一）因毒性輕微，除在局部外，他處並不發生疱疹，第一次種痘時，全身雖有反應，但遠較天然天花爲輾，對於生命，絲毫不含危瞼性。（二）身體却能獲得足够的抗體，足以抵抗天花的傳染，這禛是一種有利無弊，再理想不過的事情了。所以種痘，也就成了全世界人類的福音了。</p>
<p>有了這個基本知瞰，我們才可以一一解答上述問題。</p>
<p>（一）小兒出生後，體內尙多少保有若干受諸母體的天花抗體，（專實上做母親的人，沒有不出過天花或種過牛痘，而擁有抗體的），此種抗體，經三數月後，即行消失。故在小兒出生後，三個月內，對大花有相當但非完全的免疫性。這就是說，他對天花不易傳染，但非絕對不會惑染。故吾人對第一項問題的答案是：若外界無傳染之危險，則小孩最好在出生後第四個月至第六個月種痘，若值天花流行，小兒無法與外界完全隔絕，則無論出生多少時日　均應爲之種痘。</p>
<p>（二）上面已經說過，牛痘之免疫，至少能保持五年，故每年種痘，並非必要。——這當然是指上次種痘，曾經發疱者而言，—但若天花流行，由於種痘的方便，無害，以及代價的低廉，再種一次，自然也是有益無損的事情</p>
<p>（三）接種未發，是否需要續種問題之解答，須視是否初種，或已種多次而定。若係初次未發，便必須等過了一二星期之後，再種一次，必至接種處一度發疱，才行停止。若係第二年，或第三年，再稱不發，這正是身體已有抵抗天花病毒能力之表示，至少在該中不必續種。</p>
<p>（四）小孩曾患天花，可以不必再種牛痘。</p>
<p>（五）家中已有小孩一人出天花，其他小孩，必須立即爲之種痘，以資預防。要明瞭這問題，必須注意下列三點：一·天花免疫體之產生，約在接種後第八九日。二·天花之潛伏期爲十四日。三。天花兒童，獲得對於康健兒童之傳染性，約在先驅症候期，就是發疹的前一二日。所以某一家庭，若有一孩發現天花疱疹，那麼其他兒童，假定已紉惑染，最早也不過在前此一二天內，那就是說，他們此時應該處於潛伏期的第二三日，假若我們立即爲之種痘，免疫體便可以在他們惑染後之第十一二日產生。此時天花尙未　發，吾人往往能藉此抗體的帮助，消阻此病於無形也。</p>

<h3>送劉永純博士出國序</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>劉永純博士，於民國十一年畢業於震且大學醫學院後，即由學校當局資送留怯。劉君因在國內未習神經病學，到怯國後，即先攻此科；三年後，以其臨床研究所得，著爲論文，在怯國市堡（Strasbourg）大學應試，得該大學博士學位。嗣充市堡醫學院臨床主任二年；我國人在法國任斯職者，前所未有，而繼起者至今尙無其人。劉君於民十七年返國，返國之前一年，復往巴黎巴斯德研究院學習微生物學。蓋劉君知中國醫學未能如歐美進步之速神紉專科，中國社會尙未成其需要。果然劉君歸國之後，不特於神經病學無從發展，即微生物學亦不能用其所長；不得已楚材晋用，於民十八年受安南西貢巴斯德研究院之聘，往該院主持疫苗科事務；於各種疫苗製造技術之改進，特別努力。民國廿四年，上海已斯德研究院成立，劉君由巴黎巴斯德總統任命爲上海分院疫苗部主任。自民卅三年起，升任爲該院副院長，仍兼管疫苗部事務。在昔上海租田時代，怯租界每年所用之霍亂傷寒等疫苗數百萬公撮，均劉君夜以繼日親自督造。劉君專門盡瘁於疫苗事業，已二十年；而於狂犬病苗及ＢＣＧ之研究，從未問斷，尤多心得。上海ＢＣＧ防癆接種，開始於民國二十六年，至今已有十一年之歷史，用劉君手製之苗而被接種者，共有七千餘人。按ＢＣＧ苗雖早爲歐洲各國採用，但中國醫界已往數年，對其效用，多抱懷疑態度。劉君於製造此苗之外，一方面著文或演講詳論其體用，一方面親自接種兒童，並測驗其效率，以作精確之統計，十餘年來如一日。近來吾國人士對於此苗漸有認識者，未始非劉君提作之功也。</p>
<p>劉君謹飭謙和，對其工作之成續未敢自滿，常思以所學自效於國家，託身於外營事業之下，非素願也。今值第一屆ＢＣＧ國際會議在怯國巴黎里爾兩地舉行，其宗旨固在於討論ＢＣＧ各問題，而亦在紀念ＢＣＧ發明渚卡默特（Calmette）教授。飲水思源，用意極爲深長。劉君被巴黎總院聘請出席參加，余因而有感焉：中國致力於ＢＣＧ工作之長久不懈，劉君之外，實無他人，其爲怯國所聘宜也。劉君此番可與世界ＢＣＧ專家一堂討論，固爲劉君之榮，亦爲吾國ＢＣＧ前途之幸。最近丹麥大事宣傳，似其學者於ＢＣＧ有獨得之秘，此次劉君在公開會議之時，或與丹國專家個別談話之際，甚至親往丹國一行，觀其究竟，則此謎將不難揭開。余思巴黎巴斯德研究院不特於ＢＣＧ之研究仍執世界牛耳，而其他部門工作，亦均不後於他國；劉君此行於學術上之增進可以預卜。巴黎爲聯合國防癆總機構所在地，更爲世界文化之中心，劉君素熱心防癆，愛好文藝，其將於ＢＣＧ細菌學研究之餘，對於社會衛生曁文化事業亦加意考察也歟！</p>

<h3>火上加油</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>「五月漲風」使人們的心情緊張了一句，當局這才出來說了一通什麼「治本」「治標」又是什麼標本兼治」一類回話，可是物價已經到了「駟馬難追」的地步。之後，情勢才平定了三天，外匯於本月十七又突來調整，美匯陡然自三十二萬元掛升至四十七萬元，加價幾達五成之鉅。這種惟恐物價不漲惟恐天下不亂的作風，禛是令親者痛心，仇者竊笑！</p>
<p>不多幾天前，正與友人談及港匯黑市行情的問題。據十四日報載，爲了報紙逐日刊登港匯行市足以剌激物價，故面合眾社已停發此類電訊，本市吳市長因之表示感謝。竊思報紙天天刊載港匯市價，固然，對物價有不良的影響，可是台幣與法幣均爲中國政府治下的通貨，何以根據報載，比值幾乎逐日變更，天天改掛的呢？</p>
<p>而今美匯等牌價竟於漲風才平靜了三天的本月十七日，又驀地掛高了幾達五成。或謂外匯自上月六日調整之後，已有一個月另十天了，此次予以提高，並不爲過。竊思外匯平準基金委員會與中央銀行，同爲政府所屬的金融機關；自本月初起，中央銀行不是已經發行了一種短期庫券了嗎？依這種庫券最近發行的折扣算來，利率合月息約計二角三四分。央行出了這麼高的利率，一方面原爲貼補購券人所持有的怯幣之貶值，另一方面也是想要吸收遊資，穩定通貨。可是外匯經此次調整，升高了如許之鉅，即是說通貨於一個月另十天之中已貶值了幾達五成，讀者想想，購了庫券的人民不是吃了虧了嗎？這種情形豈不是十足表示了平準會與中央銀行步調的不一致，行動的不合作？</p>
<p>或謂平準會的調整外匯，其目的乃在促進國產的輪出與外匯的爭取。實則外匯一旦調整，國內的出口貨品立即比例照漲，而且往往會比外匯提升的程度還要漲得多，此非筆者胡說，過去事實供在，可以覆按。一年來外匯屢次掛升，而出口貨品始終未能推廣，外匯始終未能爭取者，其原因在此。</p>
<p>解決之道，愚意不在爭取國外之外匯，而在穩定國內之幣值。掛高外匯，即是通貨貶值，是項措施，實屬下策。待幣值穩定了，出口品固然易於推廣，僑匯也就不難源源而來。不此之圖，即使外匯掛升至令日的黑市程度，那適足以刺激黑市之再度狂漲；這樣，外匯仍然爭不到，反而徒使幣值降落而至於不可收拾的地步，便宜了少數握有大量黃金美鈔與物資的財閥。</p>
<p>看看當局的種種措施，像准許國營公用事業鐵路交通的動輒漲價，中央信託局出售收購物資的採取高價標售方式，國營事業出售估價的以美金計算，上月底本市社會局關於市塲收購食米勢在必行的談話，諸如此類的事，令人覺得當局似無穩定幣值之意向，看來好像政府對自己所發行的法幣竟也並不信任了。一般人們之重物輕幣，其目的無非是想保持原有的幣值。可是在這種情形之下，民之收入不足以活口，官之收入不足以養廉，我們要勸人不囤貨不投機不貪污，實在也是很難措辭了。</p>
<p>日前財政當局對於外匯政策謠傳改變一節發表談話稱：當局對於一切經濟措施必以大多數人民的利益爲依歸，此話切中時弊，最中　要，幸希照此做去爲戀！</p>
<h3>人間何世</h3>
<p>— 海燕</p>
<p>北碚朋友談：中工試驗所職以某君，夫婦均係金陵大學化廖系畢業，同任技術職務。婚後一年，有孕，經醫生檢查，謂必須住院，以防難產。此善良婦人不願爲其夫增加負担，未敢嘗試。不意日前竟以難產聞，開刀之後，嬰兒幸存，母則長逝，其夫抱子手執四百萬元醫藥帳單，徘徊江畔，痛不欲生。</p>
<p>爲了六七年來險惡環境的磨鍊，飽經中年哀樂，自認逐漸的惑情變得木强無靈的我，讀了這一消息，我竟「婆婆媽媽」地欷歔欲涕了。</p>
<p>我們這洛後的國家不是迫切要求工業麼？何以對技術人才如此殘酷！</p>
<p>這一位女技術員不是學自然科學的麼？何以會對於科學的檢查報告如此淡漠，對自己的生命如此輕視？</p>
<p>我們不是爲了抗戰死亡了若干萬國民迫切需要獎勵生育麼？何以對於產兒者如此迫害？</p>
<p>這是什麼世界！</p>
<h3>蘇東坡嗜鴉片</h3>
<p>— 念新</p>
<p>罌粟爲雅片之前身，花形頗　麗。我國明淸以來，書册時有談涉者。然其初大都止作藥物，如治泄安神止痛，蓋即麻醉之作用也。（麻醉藥發源於希臘，千餘年前希人已知用矣。）明李時珍本草綱目已載之。實則遠在宋代，士大夫間已有用爲「調肺養胃」者，惟祗以罌粟煎湯，未若現代之就燈吸食耳。如蘇氏兄弟，即頗愛食者。東坡詩所謂「道人勸飲鷄蘇水，童子能前　栗湯」是也。又其弟子由轍種藥苗詩亦云：「畦夫告予，罌粟可儲。　小如罌，粟細如粟。與麥偕種，與穄偕熟。……老人氣喘，飲食無幾，食肉不消，食菜寡味，柳槌石鉢，前以蜜水，便口利喉，調肺養胃。三年杜門，莫識往還，幽人納僧，相對忘言。飲之一杯，失笑欣然。我來穎川，如遊盧山。」亦頗稱其功效。至更以前之唐，加郭　駝種樹書所云：「鷥粟九月九日及中秋夜種之，花必大，子必滿：」亦用以煮粥或入菜。憶明末帝王（名已忘）有服所謂「島丸」（？）者，亦即雅片也。</p>
<h3>讀書難</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>在這些日子，一個普通人能在業餘尙有讀書的興趣，應該說一聲是難得，而在日常的生活之外居然尙右購買一二心愛佳作的經濟餘力，更應該說難得難得了。教育在我們本是一種特權，業餘讀書則更跡近是一種奢侈要求。</p>
<p>現在一本薄薄的小册子或極普通的雜誌，動不動就是幾十萬元。幾十萬元的數字對於有排隊看「新美人魚」豪興的人們，自然是不算一回事。不過這是趣味問題；愛看「粉腿」的觀眾，大　其讀書的興趣亦祗限於電影說明書與影星畫報之類，所以這輩人倒不致　受書價昂貴的影響。</p>
<p>據某書商告訴我，目前出版界的情形，愈是定價昂貴的東西，倒不一定沒有銷路。譬如去年某書社出版的藝術業書，以及最近報紙上巨幅廣告的美術年鑑之類，雖其發行額不巨，但購買者尙稱不弱。這是因爲書商們深知現在的市塲情况，他們知道這類書的號召力雖不普遍，惟「布面燙金」以及「皇皇巨篇」的「噱頭」，對於富賈豪紳們攀附風雅的心理，是着實有些吸引力的。</p>
<p>最缺乏銷路把握的倒是一些定價說大不大，說小不小的一般單行本，因爲這些書的平常銷路是寄託在普通讀者的身上，而這輩普通讀者，就是高中以上的學生和業餘的讀者，也就是現在社會上購買能力最貧乏的一輩人。暗市昂達數千萬的「魯迅全集」，固非這輩人所能企望，就是四五十萬一本的新書，也都祗有對之望而却步的份兒。</p>
<p>西書方面的情形更甚，西書的讀渚本來較少。平均定價在美金三圓左右的新著，能買得起的人實在很少，就是一圓業書，一個月能選購一册的人，恐怕也不多，除了工具書之外，目前一般西書的主要銷路，大概多限於旅氾的外僑。</p>
<p>戰後一個時期，西洋雜誌的銷路可說相當好，但現在除了「讀者文摘」與「生活」畫報之類外，想來也已差得多了。即以個人而論，過去每月總也要買四五本雜誌看看，而現在則僅祗有購一二種的餘力，然所費則已近百萬。</p>
<p>目前的西文雜誌以篇幅與定價爲比例，自當推「讀者文摘」爲最廉。個人對於該刊雖無偏見，惟終覺得「文摘」之類的東西，缺少一種讀一本新書時應有的淸鮮氣氛。書自然是新的，印刷也極醒目，可是也許因爲這本刋物的內容，都是經過別人代爲選擇消化過了的，雖明知內容仍舊包含着精華部份，然終不免覺得若有所失。尤其是因爲這本書太求普遍，內容包羅既廣，反不易覺察其精湛的所在。</p>
<p>鄙意認爲業餘讀書的目的，果然是求進修，最重要的却在保持讀書的興趣。業餘讀書究竟與坐在課堂中讀書不同。在課堂中讀的東西，可說是一種廣義的「文摘」；像大學業書一類的東西，雖不妨用作課外的進修工具，但決不是適於業餘讀書的東西。業餘讀書的要求除了滿足知識　外，更含有一種爲　書而讀書的興趣要求。</p>
<p>譬如說選購一本刋物，主要目然是在其內容，不過有時內容並無可取，倒是因爲裏而有幾輻插圖，幾則補白，有時甚至爲了它的編排式樣新穎悅目，買後並不想二拜續，祗是隨便翻翻，便就擱在一旁。這在有些天看來也許是浪費，但讀書的興趣，往往就在其中。這樣的讀書，雖日不求甚解，然而養性怡神，無形中就已發揮了自我進修的力量。</p>
<p>以上的說法，祗是個人的偏見，與功利主義的讀書觀自然是異趣的。現在樣樣講究效率，科學化，證書亦有所胃科學的方法，像美國的教育哲學，就着重於知識即生活，國內也已有人在實騐中，我對此自然絕不反對。但這僅適用於有形的教育。惟在這兒所說的業餘續書云云，則將知識放在第二義，而將智慧放三第一義。如果把知識看做是船上的舵，智慧實是船行其上的水。不求甚解的讀書，對於增長知識也許所得有限，但養成愛讀書的習慣，於啟發智慧上，則恐不無裨益。</p>
<p>然而在大多數愛讀書者祗有望書興嘆的今日，這一切多半是白說的了。</p>
<h3>凌霄花</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>凌霄花，藤本中之矯矯者也。望之如天際傎人，有瀟酒出塵之想。惟欲得此花，須先蓄奇石古木以待，不則無所附麗而生，生亦無可觀也。</p>
<p>是花亦名紫葳，高可數丈，蔓間有鬚如蝎虎，足着樹最堅牢，久則本大如杯，春初生枝，一枝數業，尖長有齒，深靑色，開花每枝十餘孕，大若牽牛狀，花頭開五瓣，上有數點黃色，夏中乃盈，深秋更赤，燜熳可觀，但香氣劣，開久且傷腦。</p>
<p>古人咏凌霄花云：「有木名凌霄，絕秀非孤標，偶依一株樹，遂抽百尺條，立根附樹身，開花寄樹梢，自謂得其勢，無因有動搖，一朝樹吹倒，摧折不終朝，寄言立身者，勿學柔弱苗。」詩人因物寄興，寓意深長，漫云借題發揮，直一絕好之立身箴言。此時此地，尤足發人深省也。</p>

<p>文人藝士，每以硯名其齊，當以文房密友，質堅而久，可存念故。於楚靑所贈有正精印名帖，見李梅港（淸道人）跋後，有印是「黃龍硯齋」。又翁覃溪鈞勒化度寺碑，自爲聖　，下署「絲研齊南窗記」。兩齋名皆甚美艷。考據家譽端石中間有黃氣一道，即爲黃龍。李氏所藏，是否如此，因未目覩，不敢說定。「黃龍」之名雖奇偉，尙不及「綠研」之雅韻絕俗，且綠於諸色中最饒生意，西人釋此色爲Colour　of　Growing　Grass，又曰Full　of　life　and　vigor，中國詩人名句「東風已綠瀛洲草」，「苔痕上階綠」，「庭草無人遀意綠」，「錄楊城郭是揚州」，「絲到揚州第幾橋」，「雨後有人耕綠野」，皆有一種「生命的表現」，隱約於字裏行問，故能陶醉人心，流傳眾口。現代之講究市政者輒曰「綠化」，即嘉木美蔭芳草如茵之義，而郵政信差「綠衣人」，亦與「銜　靑島」不謀而合，都有些討情畫意。是以翁學士齋名雖多，總以「綠研」爲最美。始吾以爲「綠端」之類，今正於無意中得之，非「石」而「瓦」，更爲有趣。前賢瓦硯固非少數，而如此硯之「美感」，恐亦無多，宜乎覃溪老人之名其書齊，且以「蜀宮片瓦，壽千萬　」祝此研之永存矣。嗣守之責，其何敢辭，因自號日「守綠研人」。</p>

<h3>Full Text of President Chiang’s Address: Seizing the Opportunity to Urge Reform of All Government Affairs, Shortening the Calamity of War and Realizing Unified Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The full text of President Chiang's inaugural address on the 20th is as follows:</p>
<p>I, Zhongzheng, was elected President of the Republic of China by the National Assembly in accordance with the Constitution, to undertake the public duty to the nation and the people. At this beginning of my term, recalling the hardships faced by our Founding Father and revolutionary martyrs in establishing the Republic, reflecting on the environment in which our nation and people find themselves, and considering the expectations of all our compatriots, I deeply feel that the responsibility is great and the burden is heavy. Since dedicating myself to national affairs, I have always known that loyalty and service are my inherent duties. Today, accepting this position is not what I originally intended. Over the past twenty years, internal troubles and external threats have followed one after another. Due to the long-term War of Resistance and the suppression of the rebellion, the goal of national construction has not been achieved, for which I feel deeply ashamed. From now on, our entire nation must not only build democracy during the suppression of the rebellion but also seek construction and progress through the suppression of the rebellion. This great cause of saving the country cannot be accomplished by one person alone, nor can it be achieved in a short period of time. Having been entrusted with this responsibility by the people, I hope that the people will give me their assistance. With utmost sincerity, I would like to inform all my compatriots of the needs of the country and the direction of joint efforts between the government and the people. Implementing constitutional governance is an unprecedented event in the Republic of China. We have endured countless sacrifices, difficulties, and setbacks to complete the process of implementing constitutional governance today. This is the result of a long-term struggle, the glorious achievement of our revolutionary war of resistance over fifty years, and the crystallization of the blood and sweat of all our military and civilians. We must cherish this hard-won achievement. Every individual has a sacred responsibility. Constitutional governance is for the future of the country and for the welfare of the people. If the country cannot achieve unity, independence, and prosperity through constitutional governance, and if the people cannot obtain happiness and progress through constitutional governance, then constitutional governance will lose its meaning. After the implementation of constitutional governance, the first priority is to ensure that the Constitution is not merely words but is put into practice. Therefore, strict adherence to this Constitution is the responsibility of the constitutional government and the duty of every compatriot in the country. The sovereignty of the state rests with all the people, and the responsibility for saving and building the nation also rests with all the people. At the beginning of constitutional governance, all citizens must fulfill their responsibilities, abide by the law, have a spirit of public service, and cultivate the habit of putting public interests before private interests to achieve the purpose of this constitutional governance. We must respect the Constitution, implement the Constitution, and establish the foundation of the rule of law. At the same time, all citizens must understand the true meaning of democracy and learn towards genuine democracy. It must be understood that a democratic system is a way of life, manifested not only in politics but also in economic, social, and various professional activities. Citizens of a democratic country will never give up their rights or shirk their duties. Democracy requires the minority to submit to the majority, but it is never the case that the majority oppresses the minority, and it is even less permissible for the minority to hold the majority hostage. Every citizen must have self-respect, the opportunity to express fair opinions, and the spirit to accept criticism and sacrifice their own interests. I will lead by example, wholeheartedly uphold the Constitution, abide by the Constitution, cultivate our democratic habits, and guide our country towards the true path of democracy. At the beginning of this constitutional governance, my colleagues in the government and I will strictly abide by the scope stipulated by the Constitution, perform the duties conferred by the Constitution, and lay a permanent and unshakable foundation for China's democracy.</p>
<p>The only effective way to eliminate the communists is to reform politics, economy, and society.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Constitution of the Republic of China is to "consolidate national sovereignty and protect civil rights." The greatest needs of the country at present are unity, freedom, and progress. The communists, who resort to arms and betray the country and disrupt social order, are obstacles to national unity and enemies of freedom and progress. We must gather the strength of the entire nation to thoroughly eliminate these anti-democratic and destructive evil forces. After the establishment of the constitutional government, we must further consolidate the military and strengthen military affairs, quell the rebellion in the short term, so that compatriots in the communist-occupied areas can be relieved of their suffering, and the survival of the nation and its historical culture will not be threatened. At the same time, we must ensure that all measures in the political, economic, educational, and social aspects of the country are coordinated with the military suppression of the rebellion. Today's military suppression of the rebellion is by no means a matter of party factionalism, nor is it a matter of gains and losses, but a war of national salvation and self-preservation between democracy and totalitarianism, unity and division, patriotism and harming the country, humanity and brutality, survival and destruction. Today is truly a critical juncture for the survival and continuation of the nation and its people. I, Zhongzheng, have been entrusted with this responsibility at a time of crisis. Personal success or failure, joy or sorrow, have long been put aside. I will devote myself wholeheartedly to achieving my lifelong ambition of serving and saving the country. I firmly believe that the conscious and spontaneous power of the people of the whole country is the strongest force for eliminating the communists, and only comprehensive reform in politics, economy, and society is the most effective way to eliminate the communists. In order to safeguard the foundation of the Republic of China and protect the happiness of the people, I earnestly call on all patriotic compatriots who love freedom to rise up in a timely manner, unite under the Three Principles of the People and the Constitution, concentrate their will, contribute their strength, complete the task of suppressing the rebellion, shorten the disasters of war, restore normal order, and realize national unity and peace.</p>
<p>To rectify officialdom and establish discipline, protect the legitimate rights of the people</p>
<p>The nation is bearing the aftermath of the eight-year War of Resistance, and the poison left by the enemy and puppet regimes has not yet been eliminated. The communist conspiracy suddenly expanded, causing the original plans for restoration, reconstruction, and post-war rehabilitation to be hindered, which affected society and then the economy, the economy affected politics, and politics affected the people's livelihood. The severity of the national situation today cannot be denied, and the various shortcomings in politics and society are also undeniable. These serious shortcomings must be reformed quickly, which is beyond doubt. However, the most effective reforms must be carried out through systems and laws, must meet the requirements of the majority of the people, and must be implemented in a step-by-step and planned manner, distinguishing between the fundamentals and the details, and the important and the less important. After our implementation of constitutional governance, the system has been reformed, and the relationship between the government and the people is closer. Since I personally bear the solemn trust of the people, I must seize this opportunity for renewal with the greatest sincerity and determination, and urge our government to begin reforming all government affairs. I believe that the main tasks of the new government must be to rectify officialdom, establish discipline, eradicate all acts of seeking private gain in office, appoint virtuous and capable people to renew personnel, improve the efficiency of administration at all levels, strictly implement assessments, clarify rewards and punishments, diligently seek out the people's concerns, eliminate hypocrisy and procrastination in the government style, reduce the extra-legal levies imposed on the local people, simplify laws and regulations, clarify powers and responsibilities, unify the implementing agencies, and eliminate complex and impractical laws. In short, it is necessary to enhance the dignity of the law, protect legitimate rights, ensure that everyone is equal before the law, and that the people have equal opportunities to fulfill their civic obligations and develop their personal abilities.</p>
<p>The main direction of economic measures is to stabilize prices and enrich the people's livelihood</p>
<p>In terms of economic measures, we must implement the Three Principles of the People. The provisions of our new Constitution on basic national policies related to the national economy and social security are based on the teachings of the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father. Today, we do not need to seek other paths. After the establishment of the new government, my colleagues in the government and I must do our best to follow this goal. In terms of symptomatic treatment, we must use effective methods to stabilize the currency value, balance income and expenditure, manage finance, and improve transportation so that prices tend to stabilize and the people can avoid poverty. In terms of fundamental treatment, we must be practical and realistic in promoting land reform, protecting the interests of tenant farmers, promoting agricultural land loans to equalize land ownership, using progressive tax rates to levy excessive profits, and cracking down on speculation and profiteering to control capital. At the same time, we must promote cooperative enterprises, promote agricultural and industrial production, protect legal trade, and welcome international investment to increase the quantity of materials and enrich the people's lives. We have always regarded political freedom and economic equality as the inherent goals of the Three Principles of the People. The first thing the new government must do after its establishment is to use appropriate and practical plans and concrete steps to achieve this goal. In short, we believe that the interests of the country lie in the interests of the people themselves, and the interests of the people must be based on the interests of the majority of the people. This is the main direction of the new government's domestic measures.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Practices Thrift: Old Clothes Recycled into Formal Attire; Capital City Displays a New Look with Thunderous Cheers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] This morning, when the President and Vice President held the oath-taking ceremony, they did not wear the formal attire that was completed the night before the inauguration, which contradicted the expectations of some attendees in recent days. The President wore a blue robe with a black jacket, with a large red sash, on which was pinned a Kuomintang (Blue Sky, White Sun) medal. The Vice President wore a military uniform with six medals on his chest, standing to the left rear, one civilian and one military, one in front and one behind. During the ceremony, when bowing to the national flag and the Founding Father, the President turned around, and the Vice President, like an attendant accompanying the groom, closely followed the President to his left side, observing etiquette very carefully. The oath administrator was the white-haired and white-bearded Wu Zhiren, standing to the left rear of the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, wearing a lake-gray silk jacket with large floral patterns. Wu Siyu, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies, wore a military uniform with medals on his chest, standing on the left side of the stage alongside Wu Dingchang, Secretary-General of the State Council in a Western-style tailcoat. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, also wore a Western-style formal suit, representing the National Assembly standing on the right front side. After the President raised his right hand and recited the oath facing the national flag and the Founding Father, he handed the oath book in a red envelope to the oath administrator, then to Wu Zhiren, and then transferred it to Hong Lanyou, for the National Assembly to preserve this valuable historical document. In today's ceremony, the Vice President only took his place and did not take an oath, standing to the rear side when the President took the oath and delivered his address. After the ceremony was completed, the attendees stood up together, and the applause lasted for a long time before subsiding. The President shook hands with the Vice President and the oath administrator amidst the cheers, then turned back and nodded with a smile, his joy overflowing. Then he slowly withdrew from the stage. It is reported that the formal attire of the President and Vice President has been made. The President's formal attire was specially remade by a clothing company in the capital from an existing Marshal's uniform, costing about 80 to 90 million yuan. In order to practice thrift, the President did not remake new formal attire but only modified the original Chairman's formal attire in two places: first, the four gold stars on the original shoulder boards of the Generalissimo of the Navy, Army, and Air Force were changed to five stars; second, the three gold rings on the sleeves were changed to five gold plum blossoms. The Vice President's formal attire was also made by the same clothing company, with the same material and style as the President's. The only differences were the four gold stars on the shoulder boards of the Army and the four gold plum blossoms on the sleeves. It is said that the cost of the Vice President's formal attire was over 400 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Envoys Dress Differently; Papal Nuncio Wears All Red</p>
<p>Egyptian Minister Wears a Red Hat</p>
<p>The formal attire of diplomatic envoys varied. In the Americas, except for a few Spanish-speaking countries, they all wore evening dress and medals. This simple dress is a new trend in modern diplomatic society. However, in Europe, especially Western and Northern Europe, the style of the Middle Ages was still strong. Each wore a black formal dress with gold embroidery and large flowers, with brilliant epaulets, sashes, and swords. A hat with a black velvet trim was tucked under their arms. The formal attire of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe still had some of the old etiquette on their shoulders and chests. Envoys from Islamic countries and Spanish-speaking Central and South American countries wore a lot of scarlet. The Egyptian Minister and the Turkish Charge d'Affaires both wore a red hat that they never took off. The Dominican Minister wore a bright red coat. But the most eye-catching was the Papal Nuncio, who was red from head to toe, with a large gold cross on his chest and a red cassock on the outside.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Passes Through Foreign Dignitaries' Section; Envoys Stand to Pay Respects</p>
<p>Two Sons of President Chiang Attend the Ceremony</p>
<p>At about 10 o'clock, Madame Chiang and Madame Vice President appeared at the side door of the main platform and walked down the main platform under the guidance of attendants, and sat in the seats of the fearful officials. Madame Chiang wore a long cheongsam dress of dark treasure color embroidered with the words "blessing and longevity," with a narrow border of white embroidered flowers. Madame Li wore a long cheongsam dress of black satin with a wide border of plum blossoms and the word "longevity." They both wore a black woolen overcoat. When passing in front of the seats of the envoys and foreign dignitaries, they all stood up to pay their respects, and the ladies returned the greeting with a smile.</p>
<p>The two sons of President Chiang, Chiang Ching-kuo and Chiang Wei-kuo, also attended the ceremony. Ching-kuo wore the navy blue Zhongshan suit he wears every day, and Wei-kuo wore a crisp vermilion gabardine military uniform.</p>
<h3>Nominee for Premier: Presidential Decree May Be Issued; Zhang Qun and He Yingqin Are Both Highly Touted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] After the President's inauguration on the 20th, his first task is to nominate a candidate for Premier, seek the approval of the Legislative Yuan, and form the new Cabinet. However, as of midnight on the 20th, the candidate had not yet been nominated. It is reported that the President had previously consulted with Zhang Qun to form a new cabinet, but Zhang's intention to decline was very firm, so the President reconsidered other candidates. It is said that the President's intention to invite Zhang Qun to form a cabinet has not been dismissed, and at the same time, he is considering inviting He Yingqin to serve as the new Premier. Sources believe that the new Premier may be selected from either Zhang or He, and formally nominated on the afternoon of the 21st.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the Legislative Yuan passed the rules of procedure on the afternoon of the 20th, the initial stage of the meeting has come to an end. The President's inauguration has made the approval of the Premier the most important task of the Yuan at present. The Yuan will decide to hold a plenary committee meeting immediately after receiving the President's letter requesting approval of the Premier candidate. The time will be the afternoon of the 22nd or the morning of the 22nd. The plenary review meeting will also decide whether it is necessary to request the President to notify the nominated person to present their policy views. (Opinions of 20 legislators on the Premier are published on page two)</p>
<h3>Foreign Policy of the New Government</h3>
<p>Regarding the foreign policy of the new government, I would like to explain it in three parts:</p>
<p>First, regarding the organization of the United Nations, the first responsibility of the new government in terms of foreign policy is to maintain and strengthen the power of the United Nations. Article 141 of the Constitution of the Republic of China has clear provisions regarding our country's responsibilities to the United Nations. The ideal of our sacrifice in resisting the Axis countries for eight years of the War of Resistance is that the United Nations has not yet become a powerful organization for maintaining world peace, which is undeniable. Many people, in view of the many difficulties and setbacks encountered by this organization in the past two years, have come to doubt its future destiny and its existence. We will never allow the existence of this widespread skepticism to shake our beliefs. On the contrary, precisely because there is such doubt, we should increase our efforts to maintain and strengthen the organization of the United Nations. As far as China is concerned, we can say that we did not bear the main responsibility for the failure of the former League of Nations, but for the success or failure of the United Nations, we have a common responsibility to humanity and to history that cannot be avoided, because China is one of the founding members of this organization and a permanent member of the Security Council.</p>
<p>Second, regarding general international cooperation, after the surrender of Germany and Japan, the relations between the Allied countries gradually shifted from a kind of cooperation to widespread suspicion, which is what we Chinese people are most worried about. But China's policy has always been one of peace and cooperation. We will never lightly regard the needs of world peace, prosperity, and progress from the perspective of the interests of one country alone. In terms of economy, we are an industrially and commercially backward country, but we do not therefore refuse to participate in international trade and tariff agreements. In terms of politics, we are a country with unrestrained internal strife and backward education, but we do not therefore delay our participation in social and cultural international cooperation work such as freedom of the press conferences. We believe that the highest ideal of international relations after the war is peace and cooperation. The interaction between our people and overseas Chinese and the people of friendly countries must be based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit, and strive to increase mutual friendship and respect mutual status. As for the economic revival of China, it certainly needs international assistance, but we deeply realize that only by vigorously promoting self-reliance can international assistance generate real effectiveness. After the establishment of the new government, we must continue our established international cooperation policy, and at the same time, we must earnestly implement self-reliance.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the attitude towards peace treaties, when Japan surrendered, I once said that China would never adopt a policy of revenge against Japan. I believe that whether it is against Germany or Japan, the United Nations should adopt this broad policy with a firm and unified attitude. Generosity is by no means a sign of weakness. On the contrary, reasonable generosity is an effective way to achieve our lofty ideals. Regarding the policy towards Japan, we believe that two points must be noted: (1) The Allied countries must make the greatest efforts to assist the growth of genuine democratic forces in Japan, so that Japan's political system, social system, and people's thinking can be genuinely transformed to eradicate the revival of militarism. Whether our broad policy can succeed depends entirely on whether our efforts are earnest and successful. (2) China does not have any excessive demands on Japan, but China is a country that has been severely invaded by Japan and has resisted for more than eight years. When deciding on the peace terms with Japan, it cannot but require other Allied countries to recognize that our country should have a special status in the peace conference. The above three major points are our main foreign policy directions. In short, we must be self-reliant domestically and cooperate equally externally. Our government must strive to contribute to world justice and peace.</p>
<p>I, Zhongzheng, am taking office today at a time when domestic rebellion has not been quelled and the economy is turbulent, and also at a time when world peace has not yet been firmly established. Reflecting on my responsibilities and observing the environment, I do not deny that our China is full of troubles, and I do not deny that our future of national construction is very difficult. The basic conditions for democracy are still weak. But the force of the times has made us take a big step forward on the path of democratic constitutional politics. Despite the turbulent waves that lie ahead, our determination to move forward cannot be hindered by any difficulties. I have worked hard for national affairs for forty years, and I am convinced that the Founding Father’s words "Everything that conforms to Heaven's principles, accords with the people's hearts, is in line with the world's trends and the needs of the people, and is determined to be done by the wise and enlightened, will be accomplished" is indeed an accurate and unswerving truth. Therefore, I am willing to accept this sacred mission of saving and building the country and realizing democracy with sincere and firm confidence together with my compatriots and colleagues in the government. I hope that all the talented people and military and civilian compatriots of the country will work together with one heart and one mind, each doing their best and each fulfilling their duties. I especially hope that they will point out my mistakes and give me good advice, help and support each other, and lay a good foundation for the unification, independence, freedom, and equality of the Republic of China. I, Zhongzheng, must take the will of the people as my will and the interests of the country as my interests, broadly solicit opinions, and faithfully perform my duties, so that our mission of constitutional governance and national construction will achieve complete success. (The End)</p>
<h3>Passage of the Rules of Procedure by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 20th] The Legislative Yuan convened its second meeting of the first session at 3:30 PM on the 20th. President Sun chaired the meeting, and after approving the minutes of the previous meeting, continued to discuss the draft rules of procedure. The first seven chapters had already been amended and approved during the first meeting. Beginning with the eighth chapter, Liu Bolan, Wu Hexuan, and others believed there were many objections to the eighth chapter and advocated for temporarily shelving it and starting with the ninth chapter. Chen Jiesheng and others expressed their opposition. Peng Erkang and Zhang Daofan pointed out that the discussions were excessive and lacked new ideas, advocating for the four motions proposed by the drafting committee to be put to a vote in order. Such trivial arguments led to shouts for a halt to speeches. President Sun then requested that the four motions, A, B, C, and D of the eighth chapter, be put to a vote in order. At that time, there were 505 members present. After motion A was rejected with a small minority of 94 votes, motion B surprisingly received 306 votes in favor and was passed. Motions C and D were no longer put to a vote. At 4:50 PM, amidst applause, the articles were re-read. Only Jiang Yiping proposed a textual revision to Article 55, while the rest were passed in their original form. At this point, the method of exercising the power of consent was determined to be that the Legislative Yuan's plenary committee would review it first, and then submit it to the plenary session for a secret ballot. The plenary committee would have a chairman elected by the members, and if the plenary committee deemed it necessary, it could request the President to notify the nominee to present their policy views up to three times. The original text of Article 57, paragraph 1 of the ninth chapter stated: "The Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan shall submit a statement of administrative policies and an administrative report to the meeting of this Yuan at the beginning of each session or at the beginning of their term of office." In addition to adding the phrase "in accordance with the provisions of Article 57, paragraph 1 of the Constitution," the time limit for the report was removed. This was because, in the spirit of the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan should be able to hear reports from the Executive Yuan and raise questions at any time. This amendment was mentioned by Jian Guansan at the meeting on the 18th, and now President Sun put forward a concrete proposal, which avoided the original article's self-imposed limitations and won applause from the entire audience. The original text of Article 62 stated: "Questions shall not be refused except for preserving national defense secrets or matters related to international covenants." However, after Sun Guiji and others stated that the phrase "international covenants" was ambiguous and easily misunderstood, the entire article was revised to: "Questions shall not be refused except for preserving national defense and foreign affairs secrets." Chapter 10, "Reconsideration," and Chapter 11, "Minutes," were passed smoothly. In Chapter 12, "Order," Article 71, "Members who leave the meeting early shall not affect the calculation of the legal quorum for the meeting," was amended to "Members who leave the meeting early shall not affect the proceedings of the meeting." Another article, "Members who have been impeached shall have the right to defend themselves before a decision is made by the meeting of this Yuan," was deleted as unnecessary. Chapter 13, "Meetings of Various Committees," and Chapter 14, "Supplementary Provisions," were also passed smoothly. The draft rules of procedure (the full text, after deletions and revisions, remained at 79 articles) was thus concluded, and it was already past 6:00 PM. The second item for discussion was the proposal by Tian Yushi and others to amend Article 19 of the Organic Law of the Yuan, arguing that the appointment of the Secretary-General of the Yuan should still be proposed by the President of the Yuan and decided by the meeting of the Yuan. Due to lack of time, it was not discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Interlude in the U.S.-Soviet Detente Attempt</h3>
<p>At a time when the U.S. and the Soviet Union were engaged in a heated Cold War in many parts of the world, Moscow suddenly released documents exchanged between Smith and Molotov, in which both sides stated their desire to improve U.S.-Soviet relations and resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations. As soon as this news was released, it caused a sensation around the world. People believed that the troubled world was unfolding a vision of "light at the end of the tunnel." However, Moscow's release of these documents without prior agreement from the United States suggested that the Soviet Union had ulterior motives. Furthermore, a close reading of the documents exchanged between Smith and Molotov revealed that the U.S. and the Soviet Union still had diametrically opposed viewpoints on the issues in dispute, and the distance between them remained. Subsequently, President Truman issued a corrective statement, Smith sent another letter to Molotov, and Secretary of State Marshall also solemnly declared that the United States had no intention of negotiating with the Soviet Union alone. Thus, the series of illusions sparked by the exchange of documents between the U.S. and the Soviet Union reverted to bubbles.</p>
<p>However, in this attempt at peace, a subtle interlude occurred, namely the letter from Wallace, the leader of the U.S. opposition party, the Third Party, to Stalin. This "open letter" was published on the 13th. He called for immediate action by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to stop the "Cold War" and advocated for convening a public conference to establish a peace plan for the next century. Finally, he put forward a concrete plan for a peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet differences, suggesting that the U.S. and the Soviet Union take the following steps to end the "Cold War" in various parts of the world: (1) General disarmament and banning of atomic weapons; (2) Conclusion of peace treaties with Japan and Germany, and withdrawal of troops from both countries; (3) Withdrawal of troops from China and Korea; (4) Respect for the sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in their internal affairs; (5) Prohibition of the establishment of military bases within the territory of United Nations member states; (6) Development of international trade by all possible means and elimination of all discriminatory measures; (7) Assistance to war-torn countries in economic recovery within the framework of the United Nations; (8) Maintenance of democracy and protection of civil rights in all countries of the world; (9) Citizens, students, and journalists of the U.S. and the Soviet Union should be able to move freely within each other's countries, and the free exchange of scientific information between the two countries should be restored. …</p>
<p>These many proposals are the personal opinions of Wallace, the leader of the U.S. opposition party, and are not worth overemphasizing. However, Stalin suddenly broke his usual habit and published a reply on the 17th, responding directly to Wallace's suggestions. He said that Ambassador Smith's letter only expressed the U.S.'s desire to resolve U.S.-Soviet differences, but did not provide any further plans. However, Wallace's open letter provided a concrete plan for a peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet differences, which could serve as a basis for U.S.-Soviet cooperation. Finally, Stalin struck a pose of Soviet pursuit of peace, saying: "As far as the Soviet government is concerned, it believes that Wallace's plan can serve as a good and effective basis for achieving U.S.-Soviet coordination and promoting the development of international cooperation. Because the government believes, despite the differences in economic systems and ideologies, that the coexistence of these systems and the peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet differences are not only possible; but also absolutely necessary for the sake of universal peace."</p>
<p>Regardless of Wallace's suggestions, Stalin's praise of Wallace is unprecedented in normal diplomacy. But why did Stalin praise Wallace? Anyone with discerning eyes can see that there are two main purposes: First, the Soviet Union's peace offensive. Stalin's reply to Wallace directly stated that the Soviet Union wants peace and is willing to negotiate peacefully with the United States to resolve the problem; indirectly shifting the responsibility for the failure of this peace negotiation entirely to the United States. Second, it is a powerful boost to Wallace's campaign for president as the leader of the Third Party in the United States, so that the American people who hope to follow a peaceful path and eliminate all disputes between the U.S. and the Soviet Union through negotiations to avoid a bloody war will support Wallace's presidential campaign.</p>
<p>But can Stalin's two major goals be fully realized? We must seek answers from Wallace's proposals. The main points of Wallace's concrete plan are as described above. In theory, they are indeed very moving. If this can be the basis for U.S.-Soviet negotiations, and can lead to U.S.-Soviet coordination, not to mention that the American people will fully support it, even the U.S. government will be optimistic about it. The motivation for Ambassador Smith's letter to Molotov was to test whether the Soviet Union was sincere about peace talks. Unexpectedly, although Molotov was also willing to negotiate directly with the United States, the Soviet Union's views were still diametrically opposed to those of the United States, and there was absolutely no room for compromise. Therefore, the United States had to abandon its plan for direct negotiations and change its position to demand that the Soviet Union resolve all international outstanding issues through the United Nations framework. In order to launch a peace offensive from the side, the Soviet Union abandoned the diplomatic route and sought another way, with Stalin replying to Wallace. However, the eyes of the world are discerning. In the two or three years after the war, who truly loves peace? Who is obstructing peace? It is clear at a glance. The past facts are truly too numerous to mention, and we are unwilling to repeat the old stories. Even with regard to the points raised by Wallace, they actually do not touch the core of U.S.-Soviet relations; and these issues are what the U.S. diplomatic authorities have been seeking to resolve, but because of the differences in Soviet views, they have been deadlocked and have not been opened up to this day. As Secretary of State Marshall said to the press on the 19th: "The Western countries have made long-term efforts to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve various important international issues, but they have failed to achieve results." These important international issues are also the various proposals put forward by Wallace. The Soviet Union's lack of sincerity in negotiating with the United States is obvious. Stalin's pose of striving for peace was seen through long ago, even before Secretary of State Marshall exposed it. In particular, Stalin is still singing the high-profile tune of the coexistence of communism and democracy, but after the coup in Czechoslovakia, who still deeply believes in it?</p>
<p>Every time we discuss the offensive adopted by the Soviet Union in the Cold War, we always say that the Soviet Union's methods are brilliant and surpass others everywhere. Especially this time, Stalin's reply to Wallace, on the one hand, indicated that only the Soviet Union truly loves peace; on the other hand, he fully supported Wallace, which could enhance his position in the United States, which can be described as "killing two birds with one stone." However, this ostrich-like method can only deceive ignorant people; but in today's United States, people have a considerable understanding of the post-war international situation and will never be deceived and indulge in a dream of peace. The American people have always admired freedom, and especially value the opinions of the opposition; but they will never blindly follow and agree with the opposition's willingness to be used by foreigners as a weapon against the United States. Therefore, Stalin's method may "backfire." Supporting Wallace may cause Wallace himself to be appeased and even flatter, and even advocate for "unconditional surrender" to the Soviet Union; but the result will inevitably cause Wallace to lose the sympathy and support of the American people, which will only be harmful and not beneficial to his presidential campaign.</p>
<h3>The Government Troops in Western Henan Launched a Two-pronged Attack on the Bandits and Recovered Ye County and Advanced into Wuyang. Powerful Reinforcements Arrived in the Outskirts of Laohekou.</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 20th] The Western Henan Bandit Suppression Corps recovered Deng County on the evening of the 19th and is advancing victoriously to the west, attacking the rear of the bandit troops in Guanghua and Laohekou; another government force recovered Ye County at 4:00 PM on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Office, 20th] The government army's eastward advance corps launched a two-pronged attack on the bandits from Bao'anzhai. The northern route had already entered Ye County at noon, and the eastern route was pursuing and suppressing in the direction of Wuyang. The main force of Liu (Bocheng)'s Second Column and Chen (Yi)'s Tenth Column are showing signs of fleeing back to Liguanqiao. The government army's Zhang Zhen Corps continued to advance west from Deng County today and has now reached the area west of Houpo (60 li east of Liguanqiao), launching a fierce attack on the bandits near Liguanqiao.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A portion of the 10th Column of bandits in Laohekou is reportedly causing disturbances along the left bank of the Xiang River towards Xiangyang. An elite government force is rushing to intercept them. Reliable sources say that Liu Bocheng has arrived in Laohekou.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 20th] Xinyang telephone report: The main force of Liu’s Second Column and Chen’s Tenth Column encountered Zhang Zhen’s Corps near Houpo and engaged in a fierce battle. The bandit army was completely defeated and is fleeing northwest.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 20th] A senior commander here solemnly stated today that only the area near Xuchang on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway has bandits roaming back and forth (belonging to the bandit's Third and Eighth Columns). The rumor that there are fierce battles in various strongholds south of Zhengzhou and north of Xinyang is absolutely not true.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Military sources: Our powerful reinforcements have arrived in the outskirts of Laohekou. The bandit army is now in a dilemma, and the situation in Xiangfan is becoming more stable. The air force here dispatched aircraft today to support the war in western Henan and Laohekou, destroying dozens of bandit vehicles. Approximately 1,000 bandits who infiltrated Shayang and Hougang in central Hubei are being monitored and suppressed by government forces, and the navy has been dispatched to guard Shashi. The situation there has not changed much today. In addition, bandit forces infiltrated Anlu on the 18th, and there are also bandits roaming northwest of Yingcheng. Furthermore, the 16th Pacification Zone will hold a pacification conference in Xianning starting on the 21st.</p>
<h3>A Large-Scale Annihilation War in the Central Plains is Still Actively Being Planned. Remarks by a Senior General of the Army Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 20th] A senior general of the Army Headquarters met with our reporter alone this morning to discuss the war situation in the Central Plains. According to him: The war in the Central Plains has only just begun, and the real large-scale annihilation war is still being actively planned. The bandits who invaded the southwestern periphery of Wancheng and Nanyang, because large groups of government troops are about to encircle and suppress the area, are still sticking to the communist tactic of escaping, concentrating, annihilating, and sneaking away. One route is the Chen Yi's Tenth Column and Liu Bocheng's Second and Tenth Columns, which are fleeing south to invade Laohekou. Another route is the Chen Yi's Third and Eighth Columns and Liu's Third and Sixth Columns, which are invading the Pinghan Railway towns of Xiping, Yancheng, Xuchang, and Linying. Furthermore, if the bandits who invaded the Pinghan Railway continue to flee eastward in the future, the bandits on the northern bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong may move south to echo them and seize wheat on a large scale. As for why the Chen and Liu bandits are reorganizing and replenishing on the northern bank of the Yellow River, it is because the new recruits previously replenished on the southern bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong deserted and returned home as soon as the fighting started, resulting in heavy losses. Therefore, they must drive the troops from the northern bank of the Yellow River to the southern bank to fight. As for the battlefield in northern Jiangsu, because the terrain is favorable to us, a major battle may break out. In short, the government troops in the Central Plains and northern Jiangsu have perfect deployments and will seize the opportunity to capture and annihilate the main force of the bandit army.</p>

<h3>Use New People to Implement New Policies. Twenty Legislative Yuan Members Issue a Joint Statement, Providing Opinions on the Candidates for the New Premier.</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 20th] Legislative Yuan members Chen Yuntian, Chen Haicheng, Yang Youjiong, Yang Yuqing, Yang Dezhao, Du Guangqi, Zhang Jinjian, Song Shuqiao, Li Yuyao, Wang Menglin, Wu Wangji, Fu Tongxian, Li Peitian, Liu Jieping, He Zuozhi, Luo Qiyun, Wu Jianping, Wu Daoan, Shi Honggui, Xu Shaoqin, and others, considering that the choice of the first Premier is of great importance to future political reforms, have jointly issued a statement providing their opinions, stating: "For ten years, administrative leaders have mostly had no definite policies, only knowing how to perfunctorily handle matters and never paying attention to the demands of the vast majority of the people. The legislative branch has had no way to hold them accountable, and the impeachment of the supervisory branch has often been ignored. Now that the constitutional government has begun, we demand renewal for the leading figures in charge of administrative planning and oppose the method of putting old wine in new bottles. Today, the people of the whole country are eagerly expecting a thorough reform of politics. The people's lives are already suffocating under high prices. We hope that the Legislative Yuan, which represents the people, can bring about a new transformation in future politics. The power of consent granted to us by the Constitution should be exercised appropriately. Although we cannot make any harsh demands on personnel matters, we should review whether there have been errors in the political implementation of past officials from the standpoint of the people in order to refresh the people's eyes and ears. We oppose any former administrative leaders without political achievements from re-appointing as the future Premier. The current situation is very difficult, and the future Premier must have a policy plan that addresses the needs of the environment, seeks to improve the people's lives, and thoroughly innovates politics, and submit it to the Legislative Yuan. This policy plan must start from solving urgent practical problems, specifically listing the implementation procedures for economic measures, political reforms, and even education and culture, so that the Legislative Yuan can, in accordance with the provisions of Article 57, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, ask the Premier to submit periodic policy reports and assess their political performance. In the past, the magnificent articles of the administrative policy of the Premiers upon taking office were of no practical benefit, and there was no performance during their term of office, and even misled the country and harmed the people, and no one held them accountable. This is the main reason why politics has not been clear for many years. Now, in order to rectify the source, we must specifically review the concrete plan for its implementation at the beginning of agreeing to the appointment of the Premier and oppose empty administrative policies.</p>
<p>The above is what is of utmost importance to the political reform in the future. I would like to inform the people of the country and hope that they will advocate it unanimously."</p>
<h3>Chennault's Statement Denies Reorganizing the Flying Tigers</h3>
<p>[Our News] Chennault, the general manager of the Civil Air Transport, in response to a report in a certain newspaper in this city on the 19th that Chen plans to reorganize an American Volunteer Group Flying Tigers to help China fight the communist bandits, issued a statement yesterday, solemnly stating that this news is not true, and said that the article is the author's speculation.</p>
<p>Chennault denied, saying: "I have never made any indication of intending to organize or preside over another American Volunteer Group to fight the communist army in China. I can repeat my remarks at the press conference on May 7 after returning to Shanghai from the United States this time: "I do not believe that China is currently willing to accept any foreigners to participate in the war against the communist army." At the same time, it must be stated again that I have never advocated that the U.S. military actually participate in the Chinese civil war. I only indicated that China would welcome U.S. technical training or consultants, but I have not been invited to be any consultant."</p>
<p>Chen continued: "The United States and China are obviously better prepared today than they were in 1941. Whether the United States will participate in the Chinese civil war is not my business. This matter should be decided by the highest authorities in China and the United States. I am unwilling to engage in armchair strategy." He also stated that he has now officially retired from the military and is currently in charge of the Civil Air Transport, transporting relief and reconstruction materials within China, transporting grain to war-torn areas, transporting raw materials to place B to restore industry, and transporting Chinese products to various ports for export to earn foreign exchange. I believe this work is extremely valuable, so I will continue to carry it out.</p>
<p>Finally, Chen also said: The reporter from the newspaper also asked right-wing military questions that I could not answer. Regarding the Chinese Air Force and its equipment, I have my own opinions. These opinions have been secretly submitted to the relevant authorities in Washington, but I will keep the numbers I submitted confidential until the appropriate time or before they are released by the person in charge.</p>

<h3>Guan Linzheng Returned to Chengdu</h3>

<h3>Continuing Rise of Xiang and Gan Rivers; Xiangyin and Yiyang Become Swamps</h3>
<p>Lakeside Dikes and Embankments in Imminent Danger</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 20th] On the 20th, the Xiang River continued to rise fiercely, and Xiangyin and Yiyang were entirely submerged. The dikes and embankments of the counties along the lake were in imminent danger. Telegrams were sent to the provincial government to report the emergency.

<h3>Sino-Australian Customs Agreement Officially Signed Yesterday Afternoon</h3>

According to reports, the main purpose of this agreement is to curb the serious smuggling problem in South China. Its nature is similar to the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement. The main content is that the Macau government prohibits all ships from sailing to China or from China to Macau at night. For goods that China prohibits from importing, the Macau government will not issue export permits. This agreement will take effect five days after the completion of the legislative process. It is also learned that after completing his official duties in Macau, Li may go to Hong Kong again to discuss the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement.</p>
<h3>Presidential Directives to the Five Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the President's directives to the Five Yuan and the method of announcing the appointment of officials after nomination and approval, the Office of the President's Civil Affairs has drafted four measures, which were reported to the last (19th) State Council meeting yesterday. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For documents from the President to the Legislative Yuan, the term "memorandum" is to be used. The Legislative Yuan is organized by legislative members elected by the people, and its President and Vice President are elected by the members, without presidential appointment. Furthermore, Articles 39 and 72 of the Constitution state that cases passed by the Legislative Yuan for the President to implement use the terms "request for transfer" or "transfer." Articles 43, 55, and 69 of the Constitution stipulate that cases submitted by the President to the Legislative Yuan use the terms "submit" and "request for instructions." Based on the above articles, the exchange of documents between the Legislative Yuan and the President will be done by memorandum.</p>
<p>(2) For documents from the President to the Control Yuan, the term "memorandum" is also to be used. The Control Yuan is organized by control members elected by provincial and municipal assemblies, and by Mongolian, Tibetan, and overseas Chinese organizations. Although the election of members is indirect, its nature is similar to the election of legislative members. The election of its President and Vice President is similar to that of the Legislative Yuan, and differs from the President's nomination of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan, who are appointed after approval by the Control Yuan, and from the Premier of the Executive Yuan, who must be nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan before being appointed. Therefore, the exchange of documents between the Control Yuan and the President will follow the example of the Legislative Yuan and use the term "memorandum."</p>
<p>(3) For documents from the President to the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, the term "order" is to be used. The Presidents of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, and the Vice Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan, are all nominated and appointed by the President, which differs from the election of the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Legislative and Control Yuan by the members. Therefore, the term "order" is to be used for documents from the President to these three Yuan.</p>
<p>The Five Yuan are originally equal in status. Now, the President uses the term "memorandum" for the Legislative and Control Yuan, and the term "order" for the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, which is unbalanced. However, the Constitution stipulates this way, so it seems impossible to follow the old system completely.</p>
<p>(4) Except for the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan and the Grand Justices, who are appointed after approval by the Legislative Yuan or Control Yuan according to the Constitution, the previously used method of "election and appointment" is no longer appropriate. From now on, the term "nomination and appointment" will be used to distinguish it from special appointments.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the First President and Vice President; Deeply Celebrated at Home and Abroad; Jinan Releases Captured Communist Bandits to Return to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The first President and Vice President under the Constitution were inaugurated in the capital today. Celebratory rallies were held throughout the country and by overseas Chinese, and congratulatory telegrams were sent. As of 10 p.m. tonight, this agency has received dozens of telegrams reporting the grand celebrations in Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Changsha, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Guilin, Guiyang, Hefei, Taipei, Hangzhou, Kunming, Gui Sui, Zhangjiakou, Xuzhou, Jinan, Chengdu, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Xianning, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Sydney, Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Manila, Seoul, and other places. Furthermore, many cities that had banned dancing made an exception today to lift the ban, celebrating with universal joy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] Amidst the nationwide celebrations of the President's inauguration, the military here, in reverence for the President's virtue and to show the government's magnanimous policy, released a group of captured bandits, including Zhu Litian, after providing them with ideological education and exhortation, and issued them travel expenses based on the distance of their journey, and ordered the local government to ensure their safety and not discriminate against them.</p>

<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch, 20th] As the wheat harvest is approaching, the First Pacification Zone, in addition to launching suppression campaigns, has specifically formulated measures to assist in harvesting wheat, ordering subordinate units and county governments to comply, setting a deadline for negotiating specific measures, implementing them effectively, and mobilizing refugees to return to their hometowns to rush the harvest, in order to ensure the grain supply and thwart the Communist army's attempt to seize grain. The Jinsha area of the county's seventh district has formed a team to begin harvesting north of the Fan Gong Dike.</p>

<h3>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Endorses U.S. Participation in Collective Security System, All Based on the UN Charter</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 19th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today unanimously passed a resolution in principle endorsing U.S. participation in regional and collective security measures within the appropriate provisions of the United Nations Charter. The resolution is based on the working report issued last week by Committee Chairman Vandenberg. The resolution also authorizes the United States to take action, seeking voluntary agreements with other nations, so that the veto power in the Security Council does not apply to issues involving peaceful resolution of disputes and the admission of new members to the United Nations. The proposal to amend the great power veto has been submitted by the United States to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly. The resolution is supported by the State Department and is consistent with the views expressed by Secretary of State Marshall and U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations Austin. Marshall and Austin recently testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly opposing changing the UN Charter at this time. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is also studying the organization of the United Nations. Vandenberg said that the resolution is unlikely to be submitted to the full Senate for consideration for at least two weeks. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is extensively gathering views on proposals to strengthen the United Nations, and will hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to draft a statement on the Committee's views.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee today unanimously passed a resolution that could test whether the Soviet Union is willing to take action within the United Nations to support peace conferences. The resolution, proposed by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, will urge President Truman to use his full power to ensure that the United Nations has more tools and fewer vetoes. The resolution advocates limiting the veto power of the five major powers in Security Council resolutions that do not involve the use of armed forces, supports U.S. aid to collective security alliances based on self-help within the scope of the United Nations Charter, and calls on the President to work towards the organization of a world peace force and arms limitation regulations with prevention of violations. Vandenberg emphasized that the purpose of this resolution is not directed at the Soviet Union or any other major power, but the Soviet Union has been the most determined opponent of amending the UN Charter, and the U.S. action to promote this amendment will show the truth of the Soviet Union's recent "peace offensive." The bill does not bind the President, nor does it necessarily need to be submitted to the House, but if both the Senate and the House approve this proposal with an overwhelming majority, it will be difficult for Truman to oppose it.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations Austin said today at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Social Sciences, "The Soviet Union has a direct and continuous opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate with the United States on peace." He continued, "The world only needs the cooperation of the Soviet Union to protect the world from the threat of atomic destruction. This is the main point that needs to be resolved. It cannot be resolved through negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union alone, but must be resolved within the United Nations in cooperation with other member states."</p>
<h3>Communist Party Disrupting European Balance; Britain Determined Not to Stand Idly By; Foreign Secretary Bevin Warns Soviet Union in Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Scarborough, Yorkshire, 20th] Foreign Secretary Bevin warned the Soviet Union today in a speech at the Labor Party annual conference here that Britain cannot stand idly by when Europe cannot independently lean towards the totalitarian side. Bevin delivered the government's foreign policy direction during the general debate on the government's foreign policy. During the debate, Labor left-wing member Zilliacus vehemently attacked the government's foreign policy. Bevin declared that he had no intention of changing the Russians' belief in communism. If the Russians want communism, it is none of Britain's business, and there is no need for Britain to urge them to change their beliefs. However, Europe's attitude towards communism is a completely different matter, and Britain will not allow a communist minority to disrupt the European balance against the will of the people.</p>
<p>Communism is welcome to stay within the borders of the Soviet Union, but it must not disrupt the situation in Europe again. He hopes that the Soviet Union is now able to recognize that the Western world has the determination not to allow the tragedy of Czechoslovakia to be repeated. Earlier, Zilliacus vehemently criticized the government's failure in all aspects of international relations, and he had to point out that most of the current unrest in the world is due to the lack of a fixed policy by the British Labor Party. He specifically requested the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Greece, saying that unless Britain is willing to make people think that Britain is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, the government has no reason to continue stationing troops in Greece.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Passes Anti-Communist Bill</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Mundt-Nixon bill with an overwhelming majority vote on the 19th, allowing the U.S. Communist Party to choose between severing ties with Moscow or going to jail. After eliminating all attempts to weaken this measure or return the case to the Un-American Activities Committee, the House passed the bill by a voice vote of 319 to 58. This bill will now be submitted to the Senate for discussion, and will impose the most severe resolution ever applied to a political group in American history on the U.S. Communist Party and its "front" organizations. During four days of heated debate in the House, the bill was denounced as unconstitutional, creating "thought control," and endangering the personal freedom of all Americans. However, the bill will face a difficult struggle in the Senate, and President Truman has indicated that he will veto the bill if it is presented to him for signature.</p>
<h3>Britain Urges European Unity to Become a Bridge of Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Scarborough, Yorkshire, 19th] The Labor Party Executive Committee has accepted a resolution proposed by Labor Party member Brockway at the Labor Party annual conference, which calls on the government to promote closer unity between European countries and the liberated nations of Asia and Africa. The resolution states, "The Labor Party conference is deeply dismayed by the trend towards establishing blocs of strong Eastern and Western powers, and believes that the Conservative Party's idea of organizing a Western European alliance based on capitalism and military alliances with the United States will not only fail to solve Europe's economic problems, but will also lead to a third world war." Brockway pointed out that Churchill hopes that Europe will establish imperialist relations with the nations of Asia and Africa, while the Labor Party is willing to see unity between Europe and the liberated nations of Asia and Africa. Churchill wants Europe to become the front line in the war between the United States and the Soviet Union, while the Labor Party wants Europe to become a bridge of peace between East and West.</p>
<h3>Finland Brewing Political Upheaval; Interior Minister Impeached by Parliament</h3>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 20th] The Finnish Parliament impeached Interior Minister Leino, one of the leaders of the Finnish Communist Party, by a vote of 81 to 60 on the 20th. According to the Finnish Constitution, Leino must resign immediately. It is believed that the impeachment by Parliament will lead to a political upheaval, and Communist Prime Minister Pekkala will also resign to take responsibility. The impeachment motion was proposed by Conservative Party leader Salminen on the 19th and was passed after heated debate late into the night. Leino is accused of unilaterally extraditing ten foreigners from the Soviet Union into Finland in 1945 without the authorization of the Cabinet. Leino argued that he was forced to do so by the Soviet control group. Leino, in his capacity as Interior Minister, controlled the security police, and some have accused him of placing Communists in the police force to assist the Finnish Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Northeastern Line of the Holy Land; Jewish Forces Launch Counteroffensive in Southern Galilee; Jewish and Arab Forces in Jerusalem Engaged in Close Combat</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York Radio, 20th: Washington Report: The Egyptian Army issued a communique stating that the Egyptian Army has occupied the two cities of Suneit and Beersheba and is rapidly advancing towards Tel Aviv. In addition, the Jewish forces defending Jerusalem, after suffering a fierce attack by the Arab Legion, have lost some positions. The Holy City is under bombardment, and many historical sites have been destroyed by artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 20th] Arab national forces and Israeli forces have engaged in large-scale combat in the northeastern part of Palestine, at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee. Israeli forces have advanced northward in a fan-shaped formation from the transportation hub of Beit She'an, 15 miles southeast of the Sea of Galilee, launching a counteroffensive against the Iraqi and Syrian troops moving towards the Jewish agricultural area there.</p>
<p>The Jewish area there was bombarded overnight by Arab aircraft. Six Arab aircraft in formation bombed and strafed the oldest Jewish settlement in Palestine in the Jordan River valley, Degania. Jewish farmers who have never experienced war, under the guidance of the Haganah, have also dug trenches and set up defenses behind the front line. Near the city of Samakh, at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee slightly to the north, there was also close-range combat between Arab and Jewish forces.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 20th] The Egyptian Ministry of Defense announced that Egyptian forces have occupied Deir Sneid, ten kilometers north of Gaza, and confirmed that Egyptian forces on the eastern route have occupied Beersheba, thirty miles southeast of Gaza on the road to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tel Aviv, 20th] Arab and Jewish forces are engaged in close combat, fighting for Jerusalem. It is reported that many fires broke out in the Old City on the 20th. The British said that due to artillery and mortar fire, the Christian center, a sacred place longed for by Western countries, has become a battlefield. The war in Jerusalem is being reported unclearly due to strict censorship of news by both the Arab and Jewish sides, but no matter which side wins, this ancient city will have to undergo its 19th reconstruction in history. Jewish sources admit that the fighting in the area is intense, and both the Jewish and Arab sides are sending reinforcements for a decisive battle. House-to-house combat is taking place in each building. The Arab side claims that all Jewish forces in both the new and old cities have been completely surrounded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Syrian forces announced that they have occupied the city of Samakh and the railway station on the border of Palestine, as well as nearby fortresses. The Haganah has also acknowledged this.</p>
<h3>British Reporter Killed in Action</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Amman, 20th] Major Winterton, a British war correspondent for the Cansley newspaper series, was killed by Jewish machine gun fire yesterday while accompanying the Arab Legion in its attack on Jerusalem. He was wearing an Arab Legion uniform and was taking pictures of Arab artillerymen advancing when he was killed by Jewish machine gun fire.</p>
<h3>Applying Pressure on Britain to Force Arab Withdrawal from the Holy Land</h3>
<p>U.S. Congressman Makes Proposal to the House</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] New York State Democratic Congressman Celler said yesterday in the House of Representatives that unless Secretary of State Marshall can force Britain to withdraw the Arab Legion of Transjordan from Palestine, he will introduce a bill to stop providing aid to Britain under the Marshall Plan. He said that Foreign Secretary Bevin could stop the Arab Legion's invasion of Jerusalem with a single word. If the United States is willing, Bevin can order these Arab "dogs of war" to withdraw. He believes that Britain will certainly not dare to continue to engage in things that the United States does not agree with.</p>
<h3>South Korean Interim Assembly Dissolved; Rhee Syngman Urges U.S. Troops to Remain Stationed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 20th] The South Korean Interim Assembly was dissolved today after the election of 200 representatives to the National Assembly in the South Korean general election on May 10. The Interim Assembly was established on December 12, 1946, and has passed 93 bills to date. The original number of members was 70, but one was assassinated, several died of illness, and many resigned collectively, so only 49 attended today's closing ceremony.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 20th] Rhee Syngman, leader of the Korean Democratic Party, said today that U.S. troops must remain stationed in South Korea until the new Korean government has established an army of 200,000 men, or North Korea may take drastic action.</p>
<h3>Chinese Muslims Support Arab War Against Jews</h3>
<p>Committee to Aid Arabs Has Been Formed</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 20th] The Peiping branch of the Chinese Muslim Youth Association today telegraphed King Farouk of Egypt through the Egyptian Embassy in Nanjing, stating that a committee to aid Arabs has been formed to support the Arabs in fighting their mortal enemy, the Jewish invaders. The sacred war of the Arabs to fight for their national and religious survival and freedom is of great concern to the 50 million Muslims in China. They firmly believe that God will grant them glorious results.</p>
<h3>U.S. Considering Revising Middle East Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>Marshall Announces to Reporters</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall said at a press conference on the 19th that the United States is still considering whether to take action to revise the current arms embargo to the Middle East. However, the United States will not make any decision on this matter until the United States knows what attitude the Security Council will take on the recent U.S. proposal to the Security Council to declare that the situation in Palestine is a threat to world peace.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expresses Surprise at Recognizing Contradictory U.S. Statement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] TASS issued a communique tonight summarizing the views of Soviet leaders on the statement made to the press last night by the U.S. Department of State, stating that although Stalin did not make a formal proposal to the U.S. government, the document he issued on May 17 was only a response to an open letter from U.S. Third Party presidential candidate Wallace. However, the U.S. Department of State believes that it is necessary to make a special statement to the press regarding Stalin's reply. The State Department, on the one hand, recognizes the importance of Stalin's document and the need for a peaceful solution to various issues related to world peace, but on the other hand, it said that the specific issues included in Stalin's reply cannot become the subject of direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. If these issues, such as the control of atomic energy and certain issues in the Council of Foreign Ministers, are discussed jointly with other countries, they will achieve nothing due to the Soviet Union's opposing attitude. People here are very surprised to learn of this statement from the State Department.</p>
<h3>US FORCED HOLY LAND TRUCE PROPOSAL: CHINA AND BRITAIN BOTH EXPRESS OPPOSITION; US INSISTS ON STRONG ACTION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] New York, 20th (Broadcast): Success Lake News, the Security Council today listened to the report from the Palestine Truce Committee, which strongly urged the Security Council to take firm action to force the Jewish and Arab sides to comply. Any action of a recommendatory nature would be difficult to achieve results, and the Arab side's attitude is particularly forceful.</p>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 19th] Today, both China and Britain opposed the US-Soviet proposal for a mandatory truce in Palestine at the United Nations Security Council. Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu said that the Chinese government finds it difficult to agree with the US proposal.</p>
<p>The United States advocates achieving peace through partition, but China has always believed that a solution acceptable to both Jews and Arabs must be found. It is better for the United Nations to be weak and just than to be strong and unjust. China insists on a just resolution to this issue. At the same time, British representative Cadogan suggested that the Security Council once again appeal to both the Jewish and Arab sides for a truce and order the Palestine Truce Committee to continue mediation. Cadogan said that if the United Nations adopts sanctions or sends troops to suppress the situation, the British government cannot agree, because the United Nations has no military force. US representative Austin immediately stood up to object, insisting on the original proposal and invoking Article 7 of the United Nations Charter to implement the most urgent punishments for aggressor nations. Austin said that the Security Council's appeal for a truce has had no effect, and more forceful action should now be taken. The rift between Britain and the United States on the Palestinian issue has gradually become clear, and it is expected that the US proposal will inevitably fail.</p>
<h3>THE SUGGESTIONS MADE BY THE KULLAP DELEGATION VIOLATE THE FAR EASTERN COMMISSION'S POLICY; REMARKS BY WU BAN-NONG, HEAD OF THE CHINESE REPARATIONS DELEGATION</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Wu Ban-nong, head of the Chinese Reparations and Restitution Delegation, said today: The suggestion made by the Kullap delegation that "only the main war industrial equipment in the arsenals owned by the Japanese government should be allocated for reparations" will completely overturn the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan. Wu pointed out that this report is "arbitrary and lacks factual and numerical basis." Wu said: If this recommendation is adopted, Japan will obtain the foundation of heavy industry and easily be converted into war industry. He also pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission stipulates that major war industries should include not only the army and navy arsenals owned by the Japanese government, but also aircraft manufacturing and private munitions factories. Wu said: Johnston is even more advanced than Strauss, as he even suggested removing aircraft manufacturing plants and private munitions factories from the reparations list. Johnston is, in effect, not only suggesting preserving Japan's war potential, but also suggesting retaining Japan's war industry. This is clearly contrary to the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan, which clearly declares that "the existing economic basis of Japan's military power must be destroyed, and it must not be allowed to have any chance of rising again." Wu continued: There is no reason to preserve Japan's aircraft manufacturing plants and private munitions factories.</p>
<h3>TRUMAN REQUESTS CONGRESS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO ASSIST THE RECONSTRUCTION OF JAPAN AND KOREA</h3>
<p>A total of 150 million US dollars</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 19th] President Truman today sent a letter to Speaker of the House Martin, requesting Congress to vote to appropriate 150 million US dollars to fund the reconstruction plans of Japan, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands. This appropriation supplements the 1.25 billion US dollars in "relief for occupied areas" funds requested by the government in January.</p>
<h3>ITALY SENDS A DIPLOMATIC NOTE TO THE FOUR POWERS, REQUESTING CLARIFICATION OF THE BORDER BETWEEN ITALY AND YUGOSLAVIA; SIX FOREIGN AIRCRAFT DETAINED IN ITALY</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Rome, 20th] The Italian Foreign Ministry revealed today that the Italian government has sent notes to the British, American, and Soviet embassies in Rome and the Yugoslav legation, requesting the four powers to clearly define the border between Italy and Yugoslavia. The note accused the Yugoslav government of repeatedly undermining and causing disputes on the current provisional border line, creating a difficult situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 20th] The Italian government detained six foreign aircraft on the 20th because they landed in Rome and Sicily and were suspected of flying to Palestine. Staff at Rome's Urbe airport said that three planes arrived here from Nice, France, on the evening of the 18th, intending to fly to Brindisi, which is the starting point for Italy's connection to Greece and the Holy Land. The other three planes landed in Catania, Sicily, on the evening of the 18th.</p>
<h3>MARSHALL'S STATEMENT: LISTS ELEVEN IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, PROVING THAT THE SOVIETS HAVE NO SINCERE INTENTION TO SEEK RESOLUTIONS</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The State Department today responded to Stalin's acceptance of the points listed by Wallace as the basis for US-Soviet differences. Marshall emphasized that what the world urgently needs today is concrete and remedial actions taken by the Soviet government. Only based on these actions can it be shown that Marshal Stalin has the sincerity to resolve the differences between the two countries.</p>
<p>The State Department also listed eleven important international issues, all of which have failed to reach an agreement due to Soviet obstruction:</p>
<p>(1) "Disarmament": Since 1946, this matter has still been under study by the United Nations Security Council's Disarmament Committee.</p>
<p>(2) "Atomic Energy": Officials of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission have accused the Soviet Union, Poland, and Ukraine of obstructing the establishment of an effective international agreement on the control of atomic energy. The United Nations is still facing the problem of international control of atomic energy, and the US government is still prepared to participate in any truly effective control.</p>
<p>(3) "German Peace Treaty Issue": Almost every suggestion made by Britain, the United States, and France has been opposed by the Soviet Union, which is the reason for preventing all progress.</p>
<p>(4) "Japanese Peace Treaty Issue": The United States has suggested convening an eleven-nation conference to draft a peace treaty with Japan, adopting a two-thirds majority vote in the meeting. However, the Soviet Union insisted that the matter be handled by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Although China agreed to convene an eleven-nation conference, it advocated that the four powers retain the right to veto all resolutions. So far, these widely divergent opinions have not been resolved.</p>
<p>(5) "Withdrawal of Troops from China": Currently, there are only 1,496 US Army personnel and 4,115 US Navy and Marine Corps personnel in China.</p>
<p>(6) "Korean Issue": The United Nations General Assembly passed a plan for Korea last year, but the Soviet Union did not allow the United Nations Korean Commission to enter North Korea. The Soviet Union not only refused to cooperate in implementing the United Nations plan, but also attempted to unilaterally implement its own plan, which could lead to civil war in Korea.</p>
<p>(7) "Respect for the Sovereignty of Other Countries and Non-Interference in Internal Affairs": This matter is very broad, but the actions of the US and Soviet Union can be judged by public opinion.</p>
<p>(8) "Military Base Issue": The United Nations General Assembly had previously resolved that member states must obtain the free and openly expressed consent of the host country to station troops in other member states. The agreements established between the United States and the countries where troops are stationed have been reported to the United Nations. In addition, the United States has also suggested to the Security Council that all armed forces under the command of the Security Council have unrestricted transit rights and the right to use bases everywhere, but the Soviet Union has rejected this proposal.</p>
<p>(9) "International Trade Issues": The Soviet Union refused to participate in both the Geneva and Havana conferences.</p>
<p>(10) "Assisting War-Torn Countries": The assistance provided by the United States to other countries around the world through the United Nations or other channels is a suitable answer to this point.</p>
<p>(11) "Human Rights Issues": The United Nations Human Rights Commission is drafting a declaration and convention on the protection of human rights. Since the US and Soviet Union are both members of the commission, it is unclear what other methods can be used to handle human rights issues.</p>

<h3>PLANNING TO THOROUGHLY STABILIZE PUBLIC UTILITY PRICES; SENATE DECIDES TO PETITION IN NANJING; REQUESTING THREE MONTHS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR COAL; PUBLIC UTILITY BUREAU IS STUDYING REVISIONS TO THE AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT FORMULA</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] The Municipal Senate's Public Utility Investigation Committee held its third meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, with 25 people including Speaker Xu and others present. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, also attended to report. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to petition the central government in Nanjing to thoroughly stabilize public utility prices. Participating units include: the Municipal Senate, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Cotton Spinning Association of the Six Districts, the Flour Association of the Four Districts, and the Industrial Association, a total of five groups. The petition is directed to seven locations: (1) the Presidential Office, (2) the Central Bank, (3) the Executive Yuan, (4) the Legislative Yuan, (5) the National Economic Commission, (6) the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and (7) the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>The petition requests the central government to subsidize or at least achieve the following points: (1) Pre-settlement of foreign exchange for public utilities for three months. (2) Advance supply of coal for public utilities for three months, and preferential treatment for coal prices for public utilities. (3) All tariffs on fuel accessories, machinery, etc., used by public utilities should be waived, or at least the tax rate should not exceed 18% as in the case of industrial oil, and settlement should be made at the official foreign exchange rate. Regarding the progress steps and departure date, it was decided to first convene representatives of various legal entities to exchange opinions and then depart around this month. For the selection of petitioners, the Municipal Senate side nominated Senators Shao Yongsheng, Jiang Hao, Huang Bingquan, Fei Shusheng, Li Wenjie, Ma Junshuo, etc., and requested one of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to participate. Each other group will nominate one representative per unit.</p>
<p>The meeting also decided that the materials supplied by the Public Utility Bureau will be studied by the senators first, and meetings will be convened in three groups on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of this month to review and then begin the investigation.</p>
<p>In the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities promulgated and implemented by the central government, some public utility formulas were previously pointed out by the Public Utility Group of the Senate as being unrealistic. The Public Utility Bureau is now actively studying revisions. According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, the research and revision work of the formulas found to be incorrect will take a considerable period of time to complete. The implementation of this calculation formula was initially a trial run. If there are inaccuracies, they can be revised and submitted to the central government for approval. It is feared that the revised new calculation formula will not be applicable in June.</p>
<h3>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REDUCES AUTOMOBILE FUEL ALLOCATION; CITY SUBSIDIZES RESERVE FUEL; NO IMPACT THIS MONTH</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] The central government allocates a fixed amount of gasoline to the city for automobiles and factories every month, totaling 1.81 million gallons in April. Starting in May, the central government reduced the city's allocation to 1,496,350 gallons. The city's automobile fuel allocation for May was originally going to be reduced proportionally, but now the city government has a portion of reserve fuel to make up for the difference. Therefore, the automobile fuel allocation for May will still be allocated according to the original allocation. Starting in June, it will be reduced proportionally.</p>
<h3>SMALL FACTORY CIVILIAN COAL; DECISION MADE TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND DISTRIBUTION</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] For the first proposed allocation of civilian coal to small factories, after the Fuel Management Committee submitted the cost price, the Social Affairs Bureau added insurance, transportation, warehouse rent, and legal profit, etc. The price is now close to the black market coal price, so it was decided to temporarily suspend the distribution.</p>
<h3>NEWS MEDIA STAFF RICE ALLOCATION; 1.75 MILLION YUAN PER DAN</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] The price of special rice allocation for news media staff this month has been decided to be 1.75 million yuan per dan.

The Zhejiang Security Command has telegraphed to search and suppress them. According to Wang, the rebels are not familiar with the terrain of the Four Mountains and cannot break into smaller units, so it is easier to annihilate them.</p>
<h3>NEW RECRUIT SETTLEMENT ALLOWANCES IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS; HALF THE AMOUNT PAID FIRST, TEN DANS OF RICE</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] The Soldiers' Service Association, in accordance with the previous agreement, began to issue settlement allowances to the volunteer soldiers sent to the new recruit collection points in various districts yesterday.

<h3>SEIZED A LARGE NUMBER OF SMUGGLED NEEDLES AND MEDICINES; VALUED AT OVER 5 BILLION; THREE FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN SUSPECTED AND ARRESTED; TWO RELEASED ON BAIL, ONE DETAINED FOR INVESTIGATION</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Fuju learned on the 18th that Bai Nanci (Romanian), the manager of Salon Row, a famous women's clothing company at No. 884 Jing'an Temple Road, had colluded with Ge Lundou, a Russian national from Jialun Foreign Firm at No. 177 Taixing Road, and Xu Ziman, a French woman from Room 22 in the apartment at No. 882 Jing'an Temple Road, to smuggle a large number of untaxed private medicines, "Baonv Rong B". Therefore, in the afternoon, they sent personnel to join the police to rush to the three places for inspection. The three foreign businessmen happened to be holding a symposium in the apartment at No. 882 at that time. More than 4,000 needles of "Baonv Rong B" were found in the refrigerator, flower vase, and storage room, and about 2,000 needles were also seized in Jialun Foreign Firm, valued at more than 5 billion yuan.

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] The living index for public education personnel in this city in May has been decided by the Executive Yuan meeting to be 310,000 times, and the municipal financial revenue and expenditure will feel even more strained. Director of Finance Tian Yongqian told reporters yesterday: The expenditure in April totaled more than 510 billion yuan, and the revenue and expenditure shortfall was about 30 billion yuan. The expenditure in May, that is, the salaries of all public education personnel in the city, requires 470 billion yuan alone, plus other expenses such as office expenses and construction fees, totaling about 630 billion yuan. The Finance Bureau is currently using the "quick collection" method to speed up the collection of various taxes and donations to meet current expenditures, so it can still be handled in May no matter what. What he is most worried about is the financial difficulties in June, and he does not know how to get through it. At that time, the taxes that should be collected have already been collected, and the price fluctuations in May were severe, and the increase in the living index is already imaginable. A clever woman cannot cook without rice. So far, he has not been able to think of a solution. Increasing taxes and donations requires the consent of the Municipal Senate, so this problem will be submitted to the meeting for discussion when the Municipal Senate meets in June.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Rate Too Far from Black Market: Bristle Industry Appeals for Relief, Export Traders Will Collapse if Foreign Exchange Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai pig bristle export industry hosted reporters yesterday, detailing the current pain of the industry and the general export industry, pointing out that due to the foreign exchange rate being too far from the black market, the national currency obtained by exporters for settlement cannot buy the original quantity of goods. This has led to the dwindling inventory of the seven or eight hundred export firms in the city, creating a difficult situation. If this foreign exchange policy is not changed, the entire export industry will be able to maintain itself for at most two or three months, and will eventually collapse. Under this low foreign exchange policy, the number of smugglers is increasing. Taking pig bristles as an example, smugglers to Hong Kong amount to hundreds of tons. The government's export foreign exchange income for the last month was only over 1 million US dollars, and the export foreign exchange income for this month is feared to be at most 5 million US dollars. If the export industry collapses, the consequences will be serious. Only with exports can there be imports. If there is no income from export foreign exchange to pay for the price of imported necessities, then the import of necessities will be drastically reduced, which will inevitably lead to soaring prices and social unrest. The industry has decided to take advantage of the government's restructuring and the refreshing of everything to propose two specific suggestions to the government: (1) The government can stipulate in the future whether a certain commodity is allowed to be imported, regardless of the foreign exchange rate of imports and exports. (2) If this point is difficult to implement, please ask the government to re-determine a reasonable exchange rate based on the actual purchasing power of legal tender and US dollars. The above two points are the fundamental methods to save the export industry. As for emergency relief, it is hoped that (1) the time limit for promissory loans will be extended to at least two months. (2) For goods exported at the end of May, it is hoped that the settlement of foreign exchange will be postponed for one month at the time of export, and the loan will be given in full according to the listed price of the foreign currency sold first. (3) The pig bristle manufacturing process takes more than three months, and it is hoped that the government will provide production loans to thoroughly increase the amount of debauchery in order to earn foreign exchange. The loan is guaranteed to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of foreign exchange three months later.</p>
<h3>Production Prices Rise Frequently, Goods Arrive Rarely: Rice Prices Continue to Rise Yesterday, Cooking Oil Price Increase Slightly Slower, Miscellaneous Grains Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The rice market saw another rise yesterday. Because the price increase in Xishi was frequently reported, and because of the rain, few goods arrived. In addition, the method of selling rice by the Civil Survey Commission changed, and the selling price in the North City was increased by 100,000 yuan. Early rice was called 5.5 million, and Wuxian rice was 5.3 million, with each firm limited to buying 20 shi, half japonica and half indica. 2,640 shi were sold. Although the selling price in the South City Market did not change, each firm was limited to buying 10 shi, also half japonica and half indica. The quantity was too small to meet the needs of the market. A total of 1,120 shi were sold in the South City, so people became more bullish and merchants pushed up prices more fiercely, vaguely claiming to reach the 6 million mark. Ordinary white japonica was 5.9 million, and special high-quality japonica was priced at 6.2 million. White Yuan reached 7.2 million, each increasing by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Yesterday, 2,003 shi arrived in the North City, and the South City sold a total of 3,024 shi.</p>
<p>Flour also tended to rise again. Because the prices in inland areas such as Wuxi rose, factories rarely opened. The China Trust Bureau still jointly sold it, but only miscellaneous brand flour, the price was still 1.8 million yuan delivered, and the number of applications reached 50,000 bags. However, whether it will be fully approved has not yet been decided. Lao Che and Bingsheng and other first openings were once 1.95 million, and later slightly retreated to 1.93 million yuan.

<h3>Comprehensive Sale of Cotton Yarn and Cloth from the China Textile Construction Corporation; Sluggish Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw a significant rise in prices initially, which made the "foreign firms" (客帮) hesitate and caused the bulls (多頭) to sell off, leading to a generally stable market sentiment. The initial asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was quite high, but due to tight credit among businesses, individual investors cut their losses, driving the price down to 288 million yuan. Near closing, short covering activities caused the price to rise slightly, eventually closing at 290 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan from the previous day. The initial price for 21-count Double Horse yarn jumped by 3 million yuan, but speculators and "foreign firms" sold off, leading to sluggish sales on the local market. As a result, the price was slashed by 5 million yuan. Besides, only 10-count Boy Scout and Golden Treasure Star yarns saw a slight increase of 1 to 2 million yuan due to actual sales. The prices of other yarn counts, both coarse and fine, decreased by 1 to 2 million yuan to approximately 4 to 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw news of foreign banks releasing a large quantity of US dollars, and the Central Bank continued to tighten credit. The "Tian Yi" firms could not transfer funds in time and thus sold off a large amount of stock. "Shanmen" firms and dyeing factories rarely engaged in transactions, while cloth merchants took the opportunity to sell high. The market's selling pressure increased, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially jumped by 200,000 yuan but then plummeted to 6.52 million yuan due to aggressive selling by financial firms and cloth merchants. By closing, short covering improved the market, closing at 6.6 million yuan, a slight decrease of 50,000 yuan from the previous day. Off the market, the price was slashed by over 200,000 yuan, but selling continued even after closing, with bids gradually decreasing to 6.55 million yuan, where some were willing to sell. Other fine cloths and serges also declined. Only coarse cloth, fine twill, and Shilin cloth saw an increase of 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation fully commenced the sale of cotton yarn and cloth yesterday. The prices, types, and quantities sold are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Cotton: (1) Fire Machine 950 loads, 26 million yuan per load; (2) Tongzhou Coarse Floss 5740 loads, 26.8 million yuan per load; (3) South Taicang Cotton 1300 loads, 26.4 million yuan per load. Total sales of 7900 loads.</p>

<h3>Manufacturers Preparing to Apply for Low-Price Allocation of Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Concerns Remain Regarding High Processing Costs</p>
<p>Following the announcement by the Rations and Transportation Committee (輪管會) that the government would allocate raw silk at a low price of US$3.50 per pound to silk weavers to supply finished products for export in exchange for more foreign exchange, weaving manufacturers are mostly preparing to apply. However, they still have hesitations because domestic processing costs are too high, accounting for approximately 63% of the total cost. Based on international market prices, exporting finished products would inevitably result in losses. Given the initial allocation of 200 dan of raw silk, assuming it is all woven into 140,000 yards of double crepe, the loss would be as high as US$42,000. According to industry analysis, raw silk is sold to manufacturers at US$3.50 per pound, equivalent to US$465.50 per dan. Converted at the current official exchange rate, this equals 218.8 million legal tender (法幣). If used to weave 40-inch double crepe, each piece requiring 7 catties (9.5 pounds) of silk would cost 15,314,000 legal tender. Including processing fees and all preparatory expenses, each yard costs 350,000 legal tender. With each piece being 50 yards, the cost becomes 17.5 million legal tender, totaling 32,814,000 legal tender, which equals US$70 per piece or US$1.40 per yard. However, the current overseas market price is only US$1.10 per yard, with a CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) price of US$55 per piece in New York, a difference of US$15. According to preliminary accurate calculations, 200 dan of raw silk woven into 140,000 yards of double crepe would result in a loss of approximately US$42,000. If double crepe is estimated this way, other finished products can be easily inferred. The government's fixed silk price of US$3.50 is undoubtedly too high, and there is no subsidy for labor costs. Given the current high cost of living, matching American silk prices remains difficult. However, exporters, considering the government's good intentions to promote exports, are striving to reduce costs. Even if there is no profit, they are stepping up planning to try exporting in order to earn foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Wavering Chinese Stocks, Sluggish Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks</h3>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw a continuous stream of visitors at local tea firms offering Wenzhou precious eyebrow tea samples for the current year.

Merchants also frequently increased prices, but the final result, except for the thirty-year-old Keemun black tea about to be unpacked, saw consistent fluctuations for new Longjing tea and other varieties.</p>
<h3>Interbank Clearing Breaks Record Again, Totaling 1,500.9 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending market in the city became increasingly tight.

<h3>Overseas Remittance Income Decreases Monthly</h3>
<p>According to sources at the Bank of China, overseas remittance income has been decreasing since the beginning of this year. The total amount of overseas remittance income in January was over 60.844 billion yuan, which decreased to over 30.09 billion yuan in February, a decrease of over 30.7 billion yuan compared to January. March saw over 29.378 billion yuan, a further decrease of over 7.12 million yuan compared to February. The total amount of overseas remittance income for April is still being calculated, but it is expected to be lower than March. Calculated at the current official exchange rate for US dollars, monthly overseas remittances can only generate over 60,000 US dollars, the lowest figure in recent years. An official in charge of the International Department of the bank stated that the current market price of foreign exchange is completely disconnected from the black market price. Without adjusting the exchange rate, the decline in overseas remittance income cannot be reversed. Overseas remittances are one of the largest sources of national foreign exchange income. When the government's foreign exchange income and expenditure cannot be balanced and overseas remittance income cannot supplement it, it is necessary to improve the foreign exchange policy.</p>
<p>[United Press Singapore, 19th] Government authorities announced today that the total amount of remittances to this country from overseas Chinese in Malaya in April was 1,114,973 Malayan dollars.</p>

<h3>Counselor Liu of the Ministry of Education Issues Statement Explaining Standards for Registration of Private Schools, Stipulating that Opening and Operating Expenses are Only 100,000 Times Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>[Our Report, Nanjing, 20th] In response to a report in the Jingbao newspaper that a few unregistered private middle school principals were planning to petition the Legislative Yuan in the coming days, requesting a reduction and amendment of the regulations due to the high amount of opening and operating expenses stipulated in the recently promulgated standards for registration of private schools by the Ministry of Education, Counselor Liu Yingshi specifically told reporters that the current price index is approximately 600,000 times higher than pre-war levels, and the cost of living index for public school teachers in the Beijing and Shanghai areas has been adjusted to 310,000 times, but the opening and operating expenses for private schools are still at 100,000 times the pre-war standard. Therefore, the funds needed to establish a private school now, calculated by the price index, are only one-sixth of the pre-war amount. Compared to the tuition standards charged by various private schools, the difference is still significant. The fact that a few unregistered private school principals are still planning to request a reduction shows their lack of attention to school equipment and the welfare of staff and students. The relevant authorities will not consider such requests. Also, regulations are either promulgated by the Ministry or approved by the Executive Yuan and do not typically go through legislative procedures.</p>

The list was approved by the Chairman of the National Sports Association: Chen Jinzhi, Li Shiqiao, Chen Jinde, Quan Jin (all from the Philippines), Wu Chengzhang, Cai Zhongzhang, Bao Songyuan, Li Zhenzhong, Cai Wenhua (all from Shanghai), Yu Ruizhang (Navy), Jia Zhijun (Joint Logistics), Huang Tianxi (Malaya). The selected team members are scheduled to report to the Nanjing Central University Gymnasium on May 25th to begin training. After training is completed, the instructor will have the full authority to determine the final ten official representatives.</p>
<h3>Another Victory for Black and White: Yesterday's Win Against the Swatow Team, 49 to 43</h3>
<p>The Philippine Chinese Black and White basketball team, riding the momentum of their victory over the Tianjin District preliminary team, faced the Swatow team again yesterday at 7 PM in the gymnasium. Black and White's performance was not ideal, and the Swatow team also seemed off their game, making the match still tense. Neither team's skills reached their peak. As a result, the Swatow team frequently missed opportunities in a potentially winning situation. In the end, Lin Weisong's two layup attempts were unsuccessful, leading to a 43 to 49 defeat by Black and White, a difference of three points. The first half ended in a 24-24 tie.</p>

<h3>Great China University Table Tennis Finals: National Champions to Participate in Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Table Tennis Committee of the St. John's University Athletic Association specially established a school-wide table tennis tournament this semester. The tournament includes both singles and doubles events, with over a hundred participants. After four weeks of preliminary, quarterfinal, and semifinal matches, the final four singles players and three doubles pairs have been determined. The singles finalists are Li Rongjiu, Qin Jianan, Zhou Xiong Guang, and Liu Er　. The doubles finalists are Li Rongjiu and Qin Jianan, Bao Jinxing and Chen Jiliang, and Liu Erhuang and Wu Zuyu. (Zhang Fuwei, the main player of the school team, is unable to participate due to his medical studies.) The finals will be held on the 21st of this month at the school to determine the champions and runners-up. After the finals, to increase interest and promote camaraderie, national champions have been specially invited to participate. The All-China Games champions, runners-up, and third-place winners, Wang Youxin, Xue Xuchu, and You Ruheng, as well as female players Liang Yujie, Sun Meiying, Liu Yunu, and Zhejiang's Chuan Qifang, Shanghai's Li Zongpei, Cai Xiuyu, and Taiwan's Huang Jingxi, and more than ten others will participate in an exhibition. In addition, Chen Linsheng, an All-China Games referee, and others will officiate. This gathering of elites promises to be spectacular. The Great China University Table Tennis Committee openly welcomes spectators to the competition, which will begin at 3:30 PM in the second-floor auditorium of the school.</p>
<h3>All-China Games Organizing Committee Subsidizes Transportation Fees for Mass Gymnastics Drills for Various Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau designated 52 public and private middle schools in the city to participate in the mass gymnastics performance for the 7th All-China Games, with 88 groups, each consisting of 50 students. The transportation costs for each school to travel to and from the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium for the general rehearsal and opening ceremony performance were substantial. The success of this mass gymnastics performance is attributed to the enthusiastic promotion and support of the participating schools. Despite severe financial constraints, the organizing committee has decided to subsidize transportation costs and provide commemorative certificates and medals to the team leaders of each group as a token of gratitude. The total amount of subsidized transportation fees is 318.6 million yuan, which has already been disbursed. The amount varies depending on the number of groups from each school, with 3.6 million yuan per group as the standard. Participating schools are requested to send representatives with the school seal or official letter to 139 South Shaanxi Road, to the accounting office of the Municipal Gymnasium, starting from the 22nd of this month to receive the payment for reimbursement purposes.</p>

They are scheduled to return to Siam by plane this morning. The Chaozhou Sojourners Association in Shanghai, the Xia Yi Society, and other organizations in the city hosted a farewell banquet at the Xia Yi Society last night at 6 PM. Zheng Ziliang, Chairman of the Chaozhou Sojourners Association in Shanghai, presented a commemorative flag. Li Qixiong, the leader of the Siamese athletes, gave a response. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves thoroughly, and the atmosphere was very lively.</p>
<h3>Six Overseas Chinese Units in Southeast Asia Establish Sports Committee: Promote Overseas Chinese Sports and Organize Intercity Competitions</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of their return to the country to participate in the All-China Games, various overseas Chinese units in Southeast Asia have held three meetings in Beijing and Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of the Overseas Chinese Sports Committee. Lin Zhuguang and Chen Zhang'e from the Philippines, Yun Yingzhou, Wu Foqu, and Mei Yingrong from Malaya, Zhong Zhiqiang from Hong Kong, Guo Yiqin and Weng Jiahua from Siam, and Shen Meizhen, Shen Kunnan, and Huang Xincun from Indonesia have been appointed as the preparatory committee members. The draft charter of the conference has also been drafted. In the future, in addition to promoting overseas Chinese sports activities, it will also organize intercity competitions. This is truly a blessing for the management of overseas Chinese sports.</p>
<p>In addition, when the various overseas Chinese units held a joint meeting at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, they made a decision regarding the election units for the overseas Chinese region of the All-China Sports Association. They elected Shen Kunnan and Mei Yingrong to be responsible for contacting the All-China Sports Association. The agenda items are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the sports associations of each unit should be organized on a regular basis. The resolution stipulates that the representatives of each unit should establish an organization within two months after returning to their original place of residence.</p>
<p>(2) Whether to propose changes to the Overseas Chinese electoral district of the All-China Sports Association. The resolution states that due to different customs and laws in each region, a letter will be sent to the Association requesting that the six units form a separate district, with each district electing two representatives as directors. If this proposal hinders the constitution of the Association, it will be requested to temporarily appoint six representatives from the units as honorary directors.</p>
<h3>Draft Charter of the Overseas Chinese Sports Committee</h3>
<p>(1) Name - Officially named the Overseas Chinese Sports Committee.</p>
<p>(2) Purpose - To connect the overseas Chinese sports associations in various regions, jointly promote sports, and enhance the position of overseas Chinese sports internationally.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Extends Condolences to Athletes Staying in Shanghai for the All-China Games; Northeastern Athletes to Return North Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu is very concerned about the fact that athletes from various regions have been delayed in their departure due to waiting for ship schedules after the successful conclusion of the 7th All-China Games. Yesterday morning, he specially sent Zhang, the chief of the municipal government's protocol section, to the athletes' dormitory of the Central Training Corps on Shuidao Road to express his condolences. He met with Liu Huakun, the leader of the Northeast team, and Tian Zhiceng and Zhao Borong, the representatives of Tianjin. Representatives from Hebei, Beiping, and other regions were out and not present. Athletes from various regions expressed their gratitude for Mayor Wu's condolences. It is reported that the group of approximately 100 athletes from the nine northeastern provinces will take the China Merchants Bureau's Xuanhuai ship north today. The Tianjin and Qingdao teams, totaling hundreds of people, will take advantage of the convenience of the maritime transport of grain and supplies and embark on an initial voyage on a mid-range ship. Due to continuous rainy days, cargo loading has been delayed, and they will not be able to set sail until the 24th.</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion on Human Body Fever</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>We typically regard fever in the human body as a pathological condition. However, "is fever truly a disease?" "What is the meaning of fever?" We may not all fully understand. Therefore, I have specifically chosen this topic to discuss, in order to provide people with a new concept of human body fever.</p>
<p>We must understand that our human body temperature is absolutely mobile. Normally, in a healthy state, it measures between 36 and 37 degrees Celsius in the armpit. Its daily variation is only about six-tenths of a degree Celsius. However, if we measure it in the anus or mouth, then even in a normal physiological state (and while resting), it will be three to five tenths of a degree Celsius higher. According to the "Holler's Internal Medicine Clinical Pathology Diagnosis," published last year, the body temperature of a physiologically normal person, measured in the anus after strenuous exercise, can rise to 39 degrees Celsius, while a measurement in the armpit will show only a slight increase. Moreover, if the test subject is allowed to rest for an hour and then retested, their body temperature will return to normal. This type of fever that occurs after exercise is called "work fever" (Arbeitshyperthermie). However, the aforementioned work fever requires a normal body temperature regulation mechanism to occur. There are two functions in this body temperature regulation mechanism: one is the generation of heat, and the other is the dissipation of heat. Heat generation is produced through the oxidation process within the blood and tissues, involving chemical changes. Heat dissipation, on the other hand, is mostly a physical process. These two functions are absolutely controlled by the heat regulation mechanism in the nervous center, which responds to heat and cold and regulates them at any time. Based on numerous biological experiments and clinical studies (for example, puncturing a certain area in the brain with a needle immediately causes a heat response, etc.), we now know that the nerve center for regulating heat is located near the midbrain, especially between the gray matter nodule (Tuber cinereum) and the linear eminence (Corpus striatum). The nerve center that regulates heat in this area receives cold and heat stimuli from all parts of the body through the transmission of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and exerts its regulatory instinct. In addition, the endocrine system also plays a significant role in regulating heat. Among them, the thyroid gland, pituitary gland in the midbrain, and adrenal glands are even more important in regulating heat. For example, when thyroid secretion increases, not only does metabolism increase, but also body temperature increases. Therefore, those suffering from goiter often have a slight fever. Conversely, if the thyroid gland is removed or thyroid secretion is reduced, the body temperature immediately decreases, and the hands and feet are often cold. When measured with a thermometer, the body temperature is often around 36 degrees Celsius. We also have similar clinical experience with patients with adrenal gland problems. People with adrenal gland dysfunction often have very low body temperatures, and their hands and feet are often cold. Their metabolism is also reduced at the same time. Conversely, if a patient suddenly suffers from adrenal gland hemorrhage, they will have a high fever, as if suffering from a very acute infectious disease. We have surgically removed the adrenal glands of certain animals, and as a result, the animal never developed a fever and died within a few days as its body temperature gradually decreased. Even if its midbrain was punctured with a needle (please refer to the previous text), it would no longer have a fever response. It can be seen that both the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands have a significant impact on the regulation of heat. In addition, we can also use adrenaline to stimulate a person or an animal to develop a fever. In short, a part of our body's heat regulation mechanism is in the midbrain within the brain, and the other part is within the endocrine glands. If the aforementioned two parts develop pathology, then the body temperature will deviate from its normal state and cause various diseases.</p>
<p>In the fever conditions of various diseases, it is of course caused by a disturbance in the heat regulation mechanism. However, how this disturbance occurs remains to be studied by us. According to clinical experiments, the chemical composition of the patient's blood must change in fever conditions, thereby stimulating the heat regulation mechanism and causing it to work abnormally, resulting in pathological fever. In many cases of pathological fever, the brain area is of course most likely to be stimulated and cause functional disturbances. For example, cancer sleep near the midbrain, as well as encephalitis and brain syphilis, can all cause very high body temperatures. However, most pathological fevers are caused by the stimulation of pathological chemical substances in the blood (such as toxins secreted by bacteria and foreign proteins, etc.). In addition, if chemical substances are absorbed into the body or are developed in the body, high fever often occurs. For example, Atropin, Cocaine, and Adrenaline can cause people to develop a fever. We doctors may encounter a heart disease patient who suddenly develops a fever after being given the cardiotonic drug digitalis and not know the reason. In fact, digitalis is the culprit.</p>
<p>However, I must also add that many people simply have no symptoms. If their body heat cannot be released (for example, the windows are closed too tightly or they are wearing too many clothes), they may also have a high fever, which is not a cause for concern. Also, I must add a few more words, that is: people suffering from neurosis or hysteria often have quite high fevers during the onset of neuropathological conditions, which is also not a cause for concern.</p>
<p>As for true disease-related fevers, they are mostly infectious fevers. This is of great importance to our protection and treatment. Regarding the forms and types of these fevers, we can describe them in great detail. However, due to space limitations and detailed discussions in other specialized works, I will not go into further detail.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge About Vaccination</h3>
<p>— Wu Yiqun</p>
<p>Recently, smallpox has been prevalent in Shanghai. I think all parents are anxious about their children, fearing that they will contract this terrible disease that can lead to death in severe cases and "pockmarks" in mild cases. At the same time, they will naturally think about taking them to get vaccinated against smallpox. However, most people have a very vague understanding of the basic knowledge of smallpox vaccination, and many questions often arise. The most common ones are:</p>
<p>(1) From what age after birth can and must a child start vaccination?</p>
<p>(2) Does vaccination need to be done once a year?</p>
<p>(3) If vaccination does not produce a blister, does it need to be repeated?</p>
<p>(4) If a child has had smallpox, do they need to be vaccinated?</p>
<p>(5) If one child in the family has smallpox, should the other children be vaccinated for prevention?</p>
<p>(6) Can a child be vaccinated if they are sick?</p>
<p>(7) Can a child be vaccinated if they have scabies or dampness (a common term for eczema or similar skin diseases)?</p>
<p>(8) Do adults who had smallpox or were vaccinated in childhood need to be vaccinated again?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, it is necessary to have a considerable understanding of the principles of vaccination and immunity. Smallpox is an infectious disease. After people have had the disease once, their bodies will produce a substance that resists the smallpox virus, enabling the body to resist and eliminate it when it comes into contact with it again, so that it does not harm the body and cause disease. This substance is called an antibody. According to general experience, people who have had smallpox once can, with the help of antibodies, avoid being infected again for life, that is to say, they can acquire lifelong immunity.</p>
<p>However, there is a valuable discovery in medicine that people do not necessarily have to contract severe smallpox to acquire this antibody. It is sufficient to artificially inoculate the smallpox virus locally on the skin, and the body can similarly produce enough antibodies and acquire immunity. However, this immunity can only be maintained for a certain period of time. After a few years (at most five to ten years), the antibodies will gradually decrease until they disappear completely. At that time, the susceptibility to smallpox infection will be the same as that of people who have not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Vaccine is the smallpox virus, but it has been inoculated on cows once and extracted from the smallpox sores on the cows, so that its toxicity is greatly reduced. (After being inoculated on cows, the toxicity of the smallpox virus is greatly reduced, which is also a valuable discovery in medicine.) In this way, when we inoculate the slightly toxic smallpox virus "vaccine" on humans, we get two effects: (1) Because of the slight toxicity, no blisters occur elsewhere except locally. Although the body has a systemic reaction when vaccinated for the first time, it is far milder than natural smallpox and does not contain any danger to life. (2) The body can acquire enough antibodies to resist smallpox infection. This is truly a beneficial and harmless thing, and nothing could be more ideal. Therefore, vaccination has become the gospel of mankind all over the world.</p>
<p>With this basic knowledge, we can answer the above questions one by one.</p>
<p>(1) After a child is born, their body still retains some of the smallpox antibodies received from the mother (in fact, mothers have all had smallpox or been vaccinated and have antibodies). These antibodies disappear after three to several months. Therefore, within three months after a child is born, they have considerable but not complete immunity to smallpox. That is to say, they are not easily infected with smallpox, but it is not absolutely impossible to be infected. Therefore, our answer to the first question is: If there is no risk of infection from the outside world, it is best for a child to be vaccinated between the fourth and sixth months after birth. If smallpox is prevalent and the child cannot be completely isolated from the outside world, then they should be vaccinated regardless of how many days they have been born.</p>
<p>(2) As mentioned above, smallpox vaccination can maintain immunity for at least five years, so vaccinating every year is not necessary. - This of course refers to those who have previously been vaccinated and have developed blisters - but if smallpox is prevalent, due to the convenience, harmlessness, and low cost of vaccination, getting vaccinated again is naturally also a beneficial and harmless thing.</p>
<p>(3) The answer to the question of whether re-vaccination is needed if the vaccination does not take depends on whether it is the first vaccination or has been vaccinated multiple times. If it is the first time and it does not take, then it must be waited one or two weeks before vaccinating again, until the inoculation site develops blisters. If it is the second or third year and it does not take, this is precisely an indication that the body already has the ability to resist the smallpox virus, at least it is not necessary to continue vaccination in that year.</p>
<p>(4) A child who has had smallpox does not need to be vaccinated again.</p>
<p>(5) If one child in the family has smallpox, the other children must be vaccinated immediately for prevention. To understand this question, attention must be paid to the following three points: 1. The production of smallpox immunity occurs approximately on the eighth or ninth day after vaccination. 2. The incubation period for smallpox is fourteen days. 3. A child with smallpox acquires infectiousness to healthy children approximately during the prodromal period, that is, one or two days before the rash appears. Therefore, if a family has one child who develops smallpox blisters, then the other children, assuming they have already been infected, were infected at the earliest one or two days before that, that is to say, they should be in the second or third day of the incubation period at this time. If we vaccinate them immediately, antibodies can be produced on the eleventh or twelfth day after they are infected. At this time, smallpox has not yet broken out, and we can often use the help of these antibodies to eliminate the disease invisibly.</p>

<h3>Farewell to Dr. Liu Yongchun's Departure Abroad</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>After graduating from the Zhen Dan University Medical School in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Dr. Liu Yongchun was sent abroad by the school authorities for further study. Because Mr. Liu had not studied neurology in China, he first studied this subject after arriving abroad. Three years later, based on his clinical research, he wrote a thesis and took the examination at the University of Strasbourg in France, earning his doctorate. Subsequently, he served as the clinical director of the Strasbourg Medical School for two years. No Chinese person had ever held such a position in France before, and no one has succeeded him to this day. Mr. Liu returned to China in the seventeenth year of the Republic. A year before his return, he went to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to study microbiology. Mr. Liu knew that Chinese medicine could not advance as rapidly as specialized fields in Europe and America, and that Chinese society had not yet developed a need for it. Indeed, after Mr. Liu returned to China, he could not develop his knowledge of neurology, nor could he use his expertise in microbiology. Reluctantly, like talent from Chu being used in Jin, he accepted a position at the Pasteur Institute in Saigon, Annam, in the eighteenth year of the Republic, where he was in charge of vaccine affairs. He made special efforts to improve the manufacturing technology of various vaccines. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, the Shanghai Pasteur Institute was established, and Mr. Liu was appointed by the President of the Pasteur Institute in Paris as the director of the vaccine department of the Shanghai branch. From the thirty-third year of the Republic, he was promoted to vice president of the institute, while still overseeing the vaccine department. In the old Shanghai concession era, millions of cubic centimeters of cholera and typhoid vaccines used annually in the foreign concessions were personally supervised and manufactured by Mr. Liu day and night. Mr. Liu has devoted himself to the vaccine business for twenty years. His research on rabies vaccine and BCG has never ceased, and he has gained much experience. BCG anti-tuberculosis vaccination in Shanghai began in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, and has a history of eleven years. A total of more than seven thousand people have been vaccinated with the vaccine made by Mr. Liu. Although BCG vaccine has been adopted by European countries for a long time, the Chinese medical community has been skeptical of its effectiveness for the past few years. In addition to manufacturing this vaccine, Mr. Liu wrote articles or gave lectures to discuss its use in detail. At the same time, he personally vaccinated children and tested its effectiveness to make accurate statistics, day after day for more than ten years. Recently, Chinese people have gradually become aware of this vaccine, which is due to Mr. Liu's promotion.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu is cautious, disciplined, and humble. He never dared to be satisfied with his work achievements. He always wanted to serve the country with what he had learned. He was unwilling to entrust himself to foreign-run businesses. Now, the first International BCG Conference is being held in Paris and Lille, France. Its purpose is to discuss various BCG issues, and also to commemorate Professor Calmette, the inventor of BCG. Thinking of the source of water when drinking it, the intention is very profound. Mr. Liu was invited by the Paris General Hospital to attend the conference, and I was moved by this. No one in China has been as dedicated to BCG work for so long as Mr. Liu, so it is appropriate that he was hired by France. This time, Mr. Liu can discuss with world BCG experts, which is an honor for Mr. Liu and a blessing for the future of BCG in our country. Recently, Denmark has been promoting its scholars' unique secrets in BCG. At the public conference, or in individual talks with Danish experts, or even in a trip to Denmark to see the situation, this mystery will not be difficult to solve. I think that the Pasteur Institute in Paris not only still leads the world in BCG research, but also its other departments are no less advanced than those of other countries. Mr. Liu's academic advancement on this trip is foreseeable. Paris is the location of the United Nations Tuberculosis Prevention Organization, and it is also the center of world culture. Mr. Liu is enthusiastic about tuberculosis prevention and loves literature and art. In addition to his research on BCG bacteriology, he will also pay attention to social hygiene and cultural undertakings!</p>

<h3>Adding Fuel to the Fire</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>"The May Price Hikes" made people's moods tense. The authorities only came out to talk about "fundamental solutions," "stopgap measures," and "treating both the root and the branch," but prices had already reached the point where "a team of four horses couldn't catch up." After that, the situation only stabilized for three days. On the 17th of this month, the exchange rate suddenly adjusted again. The US dollar suddenly rose from 320,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 50%. This style of fearing that prices won't rise and fearing that the world won't be in chaos is truly heartbreaking to relatives and secretly pleasing to enemies!</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, I was talking to a friend about the black market exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars. According to the 14th's newspaper, in order to prevent the daily publication of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate from stimulating prices, the Joint News Agency has stopped sending such telegrams. The mayor of our city, Mr. Wu, expressed his gratitude for this. I think that the daily publication of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in the newspaper does have a negative impact on prices. However, both the Taiwan dollar and the French currency are currencies under the rule of the Chinese government. Why, according to reports, does the ratio change almost daily, and why is it changed every day?</p>
<p>Now, the price of the US dollar and other currencies suddenly rose by nearly 50% on the 17th of this month, only three days after the price hikes had calmed down. Some say that the exchange rate has been adjusted for a month and ten days since the last adjustment on the 6th of last month, so it is not an exaggeration to raise it this time. I think that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and the Central Bank are both financial institutions affiliated with the government. Since the beginning of this month, hasn't the Central Bank already issued a short-term treasury bill? According to the recent discount on this treasury bill, the interest rate is about 2.34% per month. The Central Bank issued such a high interest rate, on the one hand, to compensate the purchasers of the bonds for the devaluation of the French currency they held, and on the other hand, to absorb floating capital and stabilize the currency. However, the exchange rate has risen so much this time, which means that the currency has depreciated by nearly 50% in a month and ten days. Readers, think about it, haven't the people who bought treasury bills suffered a loss? Doesn't this situation fully indicate that the Equalization Fund and the Central Bank are not in step with each other and are not cooperating in their actions?</p>
<p>Some say that the purpose of the Equalization Fund's adjustment of the exchange rate is to promote the export of domestic products and the acquisition of foreign exchange. In fact, once the exchange rate is adjusted, the prices of domestic export goods immediately increase in proportion, and often increase more than the exchange rate increase. This is not my nonsense; the past facts are there for you to review. The reason why the exchange rate has repeatedly increased over the past year, while export goods have not been promoted and foreign exchange has not been acquired, lies here.</p>
<p>The solution, in my humble opinion, lies not in acquiring foreign exchange from abroad, but in stabilizing the value of the domestic currency. Raising the exchange rate means devaluing the currency. This measure is a poor one. When the currency value is stable, export goods will naturally be easier to promote, and overseas remittances will not be difficult to come in steadily. If we don't do this, even if the exchange rate rises to today's black market level, it will only stimulate the black market to rise again wildly. In this way, we still won't be able to acquire foreign exchange, but instead will only cause the currency value to fall to an irreversible level, benefiting a small number of wealthy people who hold large amounts of gold, US dollars, and materials.</p>
<p>Looking at the authorities' various measures, such as allowing state-owned public utilities such as railways and transportation to raise prices at every turn, the Central Trust Bureau adopting high-price bidding methods for selling purchased materials, state-owned enterprises selling valuations calculated in US dollars, and the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's talk about the necessity of purchasing food rice at the end of last month, things like this make people feel that the authorities seem to have no intention of stabilizing the currency value. It seems that the government does not even trust the French currency it issues. The purpose of the general public valuing goods over currency is nothing more than to maintain the original currency value. But in this situation, the people's income is not enough to make a living, and the officials' income is not enough to maintain integrity. It is really difficult for us to persuade people not to hoard goods, not to speculate, and not to be corrupt.</p>
<p>The other day, the financial authorities issued a statement regarding rumors of changes in the foreign exchange policy, saying: The authorities must base all economic measures on the interests of the majority of the people. This statement hits the nail on the head and is the most important. I hope that you will act accordingly!</p>
<h3>What World Is This?</h3>
<p>— Haiyan</p>
<p>A friend from Beibei talks: A Mr. So-and-so is employed by the Central Industrial Laboratory. He and his wife both graduated from the Chemistry Department of Jinling University and hold technical positions. A year after their marriage, his wife became pregnant. After a doctor's examination, he said that she must be hospitalized to prevent dystocia. This kind woman was unwilling to increase the burden on her husband, so she did not dare to try. Unexpectedly, she recently suffered from dystocia. After surgery, the baby survived, but the mother passed away. Her husband held his son and a four million yuan medical bill, wandering along the riverbank, wishing he were dead.</p>
<p>After being tempered by the treacherous environment of the past six or seven years, having experienced the joys and sorrows of middle age, and believing that my feelings have gradually become wooden and insensitive, I couldn't help but sob when I read this news.</p>
<p>Isn't our backward country urgently demanding industry? Why are technical talents treated so cruelly!</p>
<p>Isn't this female technician studying natural science? Why is she so indifferent to the scientific examination report and so dismissive of her own life?</p>
<p>Haven't we lost hundreds of thousands of nationals in the war of resistance and urgently need to encourage childbirth? Why are women giving birth persecuted so much?</p>
<p>What world is this!</p>
<h3>Su Dongpo's Love of Opium</h3>
<p>— Nian Xin</p>
<p>The poppy is the predecessor of opium, and its flower shape is quite beautiful. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties in our country, books have often mentioned it. However, in the beginning, it was mostly used as medicine, such as for treating diarrhea, calming the nerves, and relieving pain, which is the anesthetic effect. (Anesthetics originated in Greece, and the Greeks knew how to use them more than a thousand years ago.) Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty already recorded it. In fact, as early as the Song Dynasty, scholars and officials used it to "regulate the lungs and nourish the stomach," but they only decocted the poppy in soup, not like the modern way of smoking it with a lamp. For example, the Su brothers were quite fond of eating it. The poem by Dongpo, "The Taoist advises me to drink chicken soup, the boy can offer poppy soup," is evidence of this. His disciple You Che's poem on planting medicinal seedlings also says: "The farmer told me that poppies can be stored. Small as a bottle, seeds fine as millet. Planted together with wheat, ripened together with millet... The old man has asthma, eats little, meat is indigestible, vegetables have little taste, willow mallet and stone mortar, mixed with honey water, smooth and pleasant to the throat, regulates the lungs and nourishes the stomach. Closed the door for three years, no one knows who comes and goes, hermits receive monks, forget words when facing each other. Drink a cup of it, laugh happily. I came to Yingchuan, as if I were touring Mount Lu." This also praises its efficacy. Even earlier in the Tang Dynasty, Guo Tuo's Book of Planting Trees said: "Plant poppies on the ninth day of the ninth month and the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the flowers will be big and the seeds will be full." They were also used to cook porridge or put in dishes. I remember that an emperor of the late Ming Dynasty (name forgotten) took what was called "island pills" (?), which was also opium.</p>
<h3>Difficulty of Reading</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>In these days, it should be said to be rare for an ordinary person to still have the interest in reading in his spare time, and it should be said to be even rarer to have the economic means to buy one or two favorite works in addition to daily life. Education is a privilege for us, and reading in one's spare time is even more of a luxury.</p>
<p>Now a thin booklet or a very ordinary magazine costs hundreds of thousands of yuan at every turn. The number of hundreds of thousands of yuan is naturally not a big deal for people who are eager to see "New Mermaid". However, this is a matter of interest; the audience who likes to see "pretty legs" probably only limit their interest in reading to movie manuals and movie star magazines, so these people are not affected by the high price of books.</p>
<p>According to a bookseller, the current situation in the publishing industry is that the more expensive the price, the more likely it is to sell. For example, the art books published by a certain publishing house last year, and the art yearbooks advertised on a large scale in newspapers recently, although their circulation is not huge, the number of buyers is not weak. This is because booksellers know the current market situation well. They know that although the appeal of this type of book is not widespread, the "gimmicks" of "cloth-bound gilt" and "grand and magnificent" are indeed somewhat attractive to the psychology of wealthy merchants and gentlemen who want to climb the social ladder.</p>
<p>The most lacking in sales security are some general single-volume books with prices that are neither too high nor too low. This is because the normal sales of these books depend on ordinary readers, and these ordinary readers are students above the high school level and amateur readers, who are the most economically disadvantaged people in society today. The "Complete Works of Lu Xun," which costs tens of millions of yuan on the black market, is of course beyond the reach of these people, and even new books that cost four or five hundred thousand yuan are only available to them with reluctance.</p>
<p>The situation for Western books is even worse. There are originally fewer readers of Western books. Very few people can afford new books with an average price of about three US dollars, and probably not many people can afford to buy one Western book a month, except for reference books. At present, the main sales of general Western books are probably limited to foreigners.</p>
<p>For a period of time after the war, the sales of Western magazines could be said to be quite good, but now, apart from "Reader's Digest" and "Life" magazines, they must be much worse. As far as I am concerned, I used to buy four or five magazines to read every month, but now I only have enough money to buy one or two, but the cost is already close to a million.</p>
<p>Currently, the "Reader's Digest" is the most affordable Western magazine in terms of size and price. Although I have no prejudice against this publication, I always feel that things like "digests" lack the fresh atmosphere that one should have when reading a new book. The book is naturally new, and the printing is extremely eye-catching, but perhaps because the content of this publication has been selected and digested by others, although I know that the content still contains the essence, I can't help but feel that something is missing. Especially because this book strives for universality too much, and the content is so broad that it is not easy to detect its excellence.</p>
<p>I believe that if the purpose of reading in one's spare time is really to seek self-improvement, the most important thing is to maintain the interest in reading. Reading in one's spare time is different from reading in the classroom. What is read in the classroom can be said to be a broad sense of "digests"; things like university books, although they can be used as extracurricular self-improvement tools, are definitely not suitable for reading in one's spare time. The requirements of reading in one's spare time, in addition to satisfying knowledge, also contain a kind of interest requirement of reading for the sake of reading.</p>
<p>For example, when buying a publication, the main goal is naturally its content, but sometimes the content is not desirable, but because there are a few illustrations and a few fillers in it. Sometimes, it is even because its layout is novel and pleasing to the eye. After buying it, I don't want to read it seriously, but just flip through it casually and then put it aside. This may seem like a waste to some people, but the interest in reading often lies in it. Such reading, although not seeking thorough understanding, is nourishing and refreshing, and has unconsciously exerted the power of self-improvement.</p>
<p>The above statement is just a personal prejudice, which is naturally different from the utilitarian view of reading. Now everything emphasizes efficiency, scientization, and certificates. There is also a so-called scientific method. Like the educational philosophy of the United States, it focuses on knowledge as life. Some people in China have also experimented with it. I naturally never object to this. But this only applies to tangible education. However, the above-mentioned reading in one's spare time puts knowledge in the second place and wisdom in the first place. If you regard knowledge as the rudder of a ship, wisdom is actually the water on which the ship sails. Not seeking thorough understanding of reading may have limited gains in increasing knowledge, but developing the habit of reading will probably be beneficial in inspiring wisdom.</p>
<p>However, in today's situation where the majority of book lovers can only sigh at the sight of books, all of this is mostly said in vain.</p>
<h3>Trumpet Creeper</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>The trumpet creeper is a outstanding one among the vines. Looking at it is like a celestial immortal in the sky, with the thought of being free and detached from the world. But to get this flower, you must first accumulate strange rocks and ancient trees to wait, otherwise there is nothing to attach to and live, and even if you live, it is not worth seeing.</p>
<p>This flower is also named purple wisteria. It can be several feet high, with tendrils between the vines like geckos. Its feet are attached to the tree most firmly. After a long time, the trunk is as big as a cup. Branches are born in early spring, one branch has several leaves, pointed and long with teeth, dark green. Each branch blooms more than ten times, as big as morning glory, the flower head has five petals, with several yellow spots on it. It is full in mid-summer, and even more red in late autumn, which is very beautiful, but the fragrance is inferior, and it hurts the brain if it blooms for a long time.</p>
<p>The ancients praised trumpet creepers, saying: "There is a tree named trumpet creeper, which is absolutely beautiful and not a solitary standard. It occasionally relies on a tree, and then draws hundreds of feet of branches, rooting on the tree trunk, and blooming flowers on the tree tip. It thinks it has the advantage, and there is no reason to shake it. Once the tree is blown down, it will be broken and will not end its life. Tell those who establish themselves, do not learn from weak seedlings." Poets express their feelings through objects, and the implication is profound. It is not just an excuse to express opinions, but a perfect proverb for self-establishment. At this time and place, it is especially thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>West Lake</h3>
<p>— Jiao Xichen</p>
<p>The surrounding mountains are majestic and beautiful, no different from the solemn appearance of Buddha, making my mind wander beyond the world, suddenly opening a line of blue sky. (Lingyin)</p>
<p>Climbing up the steps halfway up the mountain, sipping tea and resting in Taoguang, cutting off a corner of the lake and mountains, leisurely entering my poetic bag. (Taoguang)</p>
<p>According to legend, Chunyang cultivated Taoism and practiced alchemy here. A pool of clear water outside the cave, please let me see your face. (Alchemy Terrace)</p>
<p>The jade spring is clear to the bottom, quietly watching the fish happily. I am not envious of the fish by the abyss, but I pity the troubles of the world. (Jade Spring)</p>
<h3>Two Poems on Ancient Temples</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>The monks of Jing'an Temple set up an Ibo fast to raise money for medicine for the poor, and held a meeting with literary friends. During the banquet, they happily received new friends, and then became drunk. That night, there was a heavy rain, listening to the clear sound of carrying tiles, there was the fun of wearing a bamboo vest, and they dispersed after the bell was ringing.</p>
<p>I seek to turn the drunken ink into coolness, not busy like Mu Mei with Buddhist incense. The ancient temple is lit with lamps, and the poetic muscles are red. The spring buds boil with rain, and the wine flowers are yellow. We promise that the sky can see it. This night, we forget the world. On the way home, the bell rings, and our clothes and hats are messed up, and the passengers cheer and the shadows follow.</p>
<p>The lamp marks hang on the temples, and the wine marks are dry. Looking around, the fragrant orchids are still dreaming! Why must we meet to make friends? It is most difficult to bare our hearts because of a sentence. One kindness can save the thick green mountains, and half a wall of lonely chanting can make the white hat cold. From the moment I received the Qingfei, it flowed full of my grip, and I repeatedly looked at it hundreds of times deep into the night.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Literary men and artists often name their studio after their inkstone, considering it a close friend in the study, with a solid and lasting quality, worthy of cherishing memories. On a fine name card presented by Yu Chuqing, seen after Li Meigang's (Qing Daoren) postscript, there is a seal that reads "Huanglong Inkstone Studio". Also, Weng Tanxi himself wrote the inscription on the Huadu Temple stele, signing it below with "Si Yan Qi South Window Notes". Both studio names are very beautiful and elegant. Connoisseurs praise that the middle of the Duan stone has a streak of yellow, which is the Yellow Dragon. Whether the one collected by Li is like this, I dare not say for sure because I have not seen it with my own eyes. Although the name "Yellow Dragon" is magnificent, it is not as elegant and refined as "Green Inkstone". Moreover, green is the most life-giving among all colors. Westerners interpret this color as Colour of Growing Grass, and also say Full of life and vigor. The famous lines of Chinese poets, "The east wind has turned the Yingzhou grass green", "Moss traces are green on the steps", "The garden grass is green at will without people", "Green willow city is Yangzhou", "Silk arrives at Yangzhou, which bridge?", "After the rain, someone plows the green field", all have a kind of "expression of life", implicitly in the words and questions, so they can intoxicate people's hearts and spread through the mouths of the masses. Modern people who pay attention to urban construction often say "greening", which means beautiful trees, shade, and fragrant grass like a blanket. The "green-clothed people" who are postal messengers also coincide with "holding green islands" without prior consultation, all with some gentle affection and artistic intention. Therefore, although Scholar Weng has many studio names, "Green Inkstone" is the most beautiful. At first, I thought it was something like "green Duan", but now I have obtained it unintentionally. It is not "stone" but "tile", which is even more interesting. In the past, there were certainly not a few tile inkstones, but such an inkstone's "aesthetic sense" is probably not much, so it is appropriate for the old man Tanxi to name his studio and to wish this inkstone's everlasting existence with "a tile from the Shu Palace, may it last for ten thousand years". I dare not refuse the responsibility of guarding it, so I call myself "the keeper of the green inkstone".</p>
<p>Among the collectors of inkstones, Ji Yun (Xiaolan) of Hejian was the most specialized, rich, and famous. Ji's study was called "Ninety-Nine Inkstone Studio", and each inkstone had its own inscription and record. Since it was praised by the literati, it is untrustworthy to borrow names in the market, whether it is purple or green, new or old, pretending to be "Guanwei Cottage", or "Xiaolan", or "Ji Yun". The only one I have seen is the inkstone in the collection of Zhuo Xingcha, the brother of Huayang. It is definitely an old object of Ji, Zhuo's ancestor, Wengong (Bingtian, zi Haifan, a scholar of the Qing Daoxian period, and the governor of Shuntian Prefecture). Zhuo entered the Jinshi in the Wangxu year of Jiaqing, and Ji was the chief examiner of the hui examination. Later, they were both seniors and juniors in the Hanlin Academy. They personally inherited his mantle and were given the inkstone, which has been passed down to this day. The shape of the inkstone is long, with slightly convex sides like a drum. There is an inscription on the back that reads, "Hold and compare it to the old pit, far behind it. But compare it to the new pit, you are slightly older. Although the borders are narrow, its thickness is valuable. Rest in the ink forest and quietly nourish your longevity. After another hundred years, you will also be a rare sight." This is a pun, one to write about the inkstone, and one to express people. The wonder lies in its natural and fitting, casual writing that is thought-provoking. At a glance, one knows that it cannot be done by ordinary hands.</p>
