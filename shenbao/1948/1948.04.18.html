<h3>主席親至國大報到　勉各代表遵守紀律　負重任做民主憲政模范</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕蔣主席十七日晚六時廿二分在國大會堂對第一審查委會作四分鐘致詞，主席着軍便服，先於五時半赴國大報到處報到，領得第二七六五號證章後，再赴主席團辦公室，六時十分出坐於政府長官席上，目擊會塲混亂餘波，候至散會後發言，主席目稱，係以人民資格說話，略謂：第一屆國大乃卅七年來死去多少先烈，多少人民始能達成者，國大兩大重任為（一）行憲戡亂，建設國家，（二）做以後國大永久模範，此重任須由每位代表担負，今日情形，在我看來，民主憲政很悲觀，吾人要做民主憲政的模範，不能為民主憲政留污點，我謹以人民資格，要求各位代表負責任，守紀律，遵守會塲秩序，希望各位代表今後不再有今日情形，否則國大代表之信用將受損害，中外人士亦感悲觀。主席詞意極為懇切，講話時全塲寂然，與數分鐘前之喧囂判若天淵。主席侮語甫畢，即獲熱烈歡聲。民·靑兩黨黨員亦均鼓掌擁護，末主席表示謝意後聞去。</p>
<h3>總裁召開談話會　勗勉國民黨國大代表　對憲法以不修改為宜</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕十七日下午二時半，國民黨蔣總裁召集國民大會代表中之該黨同志，於國防部大禮堂舉行談話會，蔣總栽於聰取各黨員對於有關憲法各案意見後，剴切致詞勗勉各同志應尊重本黨傳統精神，珍惜本黨五十年奮鬥之歷史，明暸國家當前之需要，對於憲法問題，允宜依照本黨旣定之方針，除對於戡亂有關者可予袖充臨時性之條款外，均以不修改為宜，各同志於聆訓後，皆甚感動，一致接受蔣總裁之指示，談話會於三時十五分結束。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國大十七日舉行第十一次會，十時主席秦德純宣吿開始本日議程，首由第一審查委會代表張映書報吿，十六日全日舉行審查會無結果，因昨日審查過程係廣泛討論，要求發言者達一一〇人，而發言者僅及卅二人，故本日應繼續審查，當由主席提出根據議事規則第四十七條之規定，第一審查會之憲法修改案未獲得結論，不能提出二讀會，大會是否有變更議事日程之必要，經提付表決後，在塲人數一八七七人，贊成者一四〇九人，多數通過，十時廿分宣布大會散會，各審查委會繼續分別舉行。</p>
<h3>戡亂時期應付變故　總統得緊急處分　修憲審會通過綜合報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕第一審委會十七日午十一時開會，羅文誤主席，在羅就主席職前，首由胡適代表團主席提出報吿稱原任第一審委會召集人，因自認對昨日討論未獲結論一事，表示歉意，全體引咎辭職，現經勸導，巳勉為之·嗣主席就職，首先吿罪，次聲明兩點：（一）應依照議事程序進行，（二）維持會塲秩序，正反兩面意見，盼均自由發表。（三）主席個人無任何成見。末徵詢發言方式，係採取廣泛發表意見，抑就各案逐條發言，旋仍多數認為應廣泛檢討，惟會塲內自由發言者頗多，大多認為不必超出提案之範圍，以迅速結束討論。惟民社黨王培基突至發言台，大呼，提案之成立，係有一定的程序，即經代表五分之一之連署，始能提出，現發現會塲內有「大代表」，「小代表」之別，大代表可代小代表簽名者，王發言態度與措詞失當，若干代表均提出責難，一時會塲大為混亂，台上台下一片喧囂，而喧囂中，黨派意識復極濃厚，經主席一再呼籲維持會塲秩序，王代表等始下台就座。當由主席宣布，王代表措詞不當，交代表懲戒委會辦理。一陣風雨過處，林紫貴復大聲呼有臨時最緊急，最需要之事發生，即在際此會塲內以修憲與不修憲之爭論時，會堂外正有遺憲之事發生，即簽署代表廿餘人前來請願，巳為憲警包圍，林言未終，台下一聲嗤，林未能達成發言目的而下。旋開始審查，錢天任又突呼「罷免主席」，終以不得呼應，未獲下文。張旦平等乃繼續發言，仍多採贊同修憲與反對修憲兩點集中發言，張旦平首稱：吾人主張修改憲法廿七條，僅係對國大職權之增加，吾人認為凡能使人民有權之政黨，吾人必予擁護，反之，吾人不要。張說明罷免總統，副總統之程序，首經代表五分之二之連署罷免申請書，公吿卅日後，再送立院提出，末由國大開會罷免。張認為國大必須有自由集會之權。朱士烈稱：會塲內有一情形，即黨高於一切，本人係國民黨黨員，但今日站在普通代表立塲發言，渠認為修改第廿七條，擴大國大職權，並不動搖全部憲法，朱並謂如共黨到了門口，我們都受不了。劉宜廷發言，對增加國大職權及臨時條款均表贊同田克明指出僑民選舉之不合於現實，有修改之必要，且若干問題均係事寶所必需，故渠贊同修改，認為對全部憲法不致有所勸搖。而今日通過之修改案，並非自今日起即可施行，其間尚有一公吿期，是時已十二時，主席宣布散會。下午四時繼續開會，由林彬主席，塲中仍是　一片喧囂，至晚六時許，　　蔣主席便裝而至，方歸靜止。旋表決通過綜合提出之審查報告，內容係包括授權總統之臨時條款及國大臨時會會期之訂定，至原提其他修改憲法各案，則於臨時會中討論。茲誌通過之審查報吿如下：一本審查委員會審議有關憲法各案，認為在此動員戡亂時期，莫代表德惠等所提臨時案款確有必要之同時，國民大會臨時會之召集，亦應予以確定，俾本屆所提其他修改憲法各案得於臨時會中獲得適當之討論與決定。茲本以上意旨，擬就莫德惠代表等原提案加列一項，謹請大會將左列全文予以採納，移付二讀會，三讀曾。</p>
<p>動員戡亂時期臨時條款。</p>
<p>茲依照憲法第一七四條第一款程序，制定動員戡亂時期臨時條款如左：總統在動員戡亂時期為避免國家或人民遭遇緊急危難或應付財政。經濟上重大變故，得經行政院會議之決議，為緊急處分，不受憲法第卅九條或第四十三條所規定程序之限制。</p>
<p>前項緊急處分，立法院得代憲法第五十七條第二款規定之程序變更或廢止之。</p>
<p>動員戡亂時期之終止，由總統宣吿或由立法院咨請總統宣吿之。</p>
<p>第一屆國民大會，應由總統蓋暹於民國卅九年十二月廿五日以前召集臨時會，討論有關修改憲法各案，如屆時動員戡亂時期尚未依前項規定宣吿終止，國民大會臨時會應決定臨時條款應否延長或廢止。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　如何培養優良的學風！</h3>
<p>— 周緝熙</p>
<p>我們要培養優良的學風，必先明瞭今”學風之所以敗壞的原因所在。據作者的觀察，辦學與敎書的人，不重自己人格的修養，學問的進修，甚至德不足以化人，學不足以服衆，發生意外事件，則以高壓手段，對付有熱血，多勇氣，能奮鬥犧牲的，血氣方剛的靑年舉生。殊不知他們非地位所能壓迫，非威權所能屈服；或用花言巧語，來欺凌利誘，殊不知他們有純正的思想，有正確的見解，非空言所能欺騙，非厚利所能引誘，再加上職業學生從中利用鼓動，罷課之類的學潮就不免因之而暴發了。所以我們要培養優良的學風，敎育當局，應敦聘博學多能並德高望重的第一流學者做大學校長；校長應禮聘人格高尙，學有專長的名師，作靑年學子爲學做人的優良導師，而其治學，作事，待人，接物乃至於一言一動，均可作一般靑年的楷模。這就是以身敎而不以口敎的一重人格感化的教育。這種敎育的力量，不但是靑年學生勵志，好學，敦品，力行的動力，足以培養優良的學風，並可進而改造社會，移風易俗。所以這是培養優良學風的最好方法。</p>
<p>學校法治化，敎育民主化，也是培養優良學風的好方法。例如淸末由蔡元培先生做總理，吳敬恒先生作學監的私立愛國學社，讓學生依法治校，學生好比立法者，敎職員好比執行者，而且師生互相敎學，同甘同苦，相親相愛，有如家人父子，眞像一個大家庭。後來蔡先生主特北京大學，也讓學生自治，卒成學風最優良對學術貢獻最大的一個最高學府。最近，作者在京與前鄕村建設學院訓導主任李之樸氏晤談，說他也採取學生立法行法，自治治校的精神，以培養該校的優良學風。不但大學應該如此，中學亦應這樣。例如名聞海內的浙江省立湘湖師範學校，在做該校校長垂二十年的敎育家金海觀先生領導之下，不但在校學生能立法守法，自治治事，敦品勵行，進德修業，蔚成優異的學風，即畢業出校服務的學生，也都在該校畢業生指導部督導之下，遵守母校的法規，勤勉工作，忠實服務，蔚爲風氣。所以學校法治化，教育民主化，也是培養優良學風的一個方法。</p>
<p>思想自由是當前敎育上一大問題，與學潮學風，都有密切的關係。關於這個問題，作者始終認爲思想無法統一，也不必統一，尤其是學術機關，應該讓每一個人海闊天空的去想，心安理得的去想；並且應該給他一個放胆的環境，毫無顧忌的絕對自由的去想。任何人的頭腦最好不要受人干涉，同時也不要千涉人家。思想可以表現之於言語，在不違反社會秩序，國家法律的條件之下，用言語可以和人家交換意見，討論問題，或者向人家討敎學習，但絕對不許動手動脚。根據這一個原則，學生們發生由思想而起的爭論當加以尊重，依照其思想而選讀的書籍當予以放任。不過學生們發生因思想而起的糾紛，須受禁止。依照其思想或誤用其思想，在校內校外妄作妄爲，須受校規與國法的制裁。在過去，大學或中學，都有「三民主義」或「黨義」一課，行憲後的大學，應改設「哲學」一課程，中學則可加强「公民」一課的敎學，以指導學生的思想與行爲。關於主義的敎學，可以「三民主義」作中心，並泛論其他一切主義的利弊得失，因爲三民主義是近代世界上一種思潮，並且還是佔着世界上很大的面積，佔着人類中很多的人口的一種思想主流，牠包括着近代許多哲學政治學的學說思想，牠不是一黨的黨義，也不是宗敎的經典，而是一種兼容並包的救國的主義。可從學術立塲上，解釋三民主義的，從而誘導靑年學生的思想行爲，養成思想自由的學風。與思想自由極有關係的，就是研究，講學，言論，出版等的自由。大學有研究與講學的自由，人民有言論出版等自由，是現代民主國家一致公認的原則·蓋唯享有自由研究，自由講學等權利，並確保言論出版等自由，學術才能進步，社會才能文明。最近聯合國文敎會議，也特別强調此一原則，促起各國的注意。「中華民國憲法」第十一條也有這樣的明文規定：「人民有言論，講學，著作及出版之自由」，行憲後必須付之實施，見諸事實，並發揚此一可寳貴的民主精神，培養自由研究，自由講學的學風，以促進敎育的民主化。</p>
<p>學校環境也與培養優良的學風有關係。例如在　奮淫佚，侈靡成風的大都市區內，是不適辦大學的，辦大學最好應辦在離大都市不遠而環境優良，風景秀麗，淸靜幽美，交通便利的地方，如離上海市區不遠的「復且大學」，離武昌市區不遠的「武漢大學」，都是宜於辦大學的地方。即中等學校，最好也辦在鄕間，例如前文已談及的浙江省立湘湖師範學校。就是辦在雕杭州不遠的湘湖之畔，厭湖山之麓，莘莘學子，研讀於山明水秀的幽靜美好的環境中，最易於陶冶淸高的品格，研究高深的學問，尤其易於培養刻苦，耐勞，服務，奮鬥，犧牲的精神，以及勤勞，儉約，忠實，誠懇，信義，仁愛等美德，學校中的習慣風尙，自然日新月異而形成優美的學風了。</p>
<p>敎育是最費錢的事業，也是最淸苦的工作。所以今後的教靑經費，必須實行憲法第一六四條之規定：「敎育，科學，文化之經費，在中央不得少於其預算總額百分之十五，在省不得少於其預算總額百分之二十五，在市縣不得少於百分之三十五，其依法設置之敎育文化基金及產業，應予以保障。」同時，並須提高敎師待遇達到戰前水準，增加學術研究費，使能名實相符，的確可以做學術研究時的費用，尤應增進敎師福利，保陣敎師職業。這樣，才能使敎育工作者，生活安定，安心工作，循循善誘，敎導靑年使他們砥礪學行，進德修業，養成優良的學風。</p>

<h3>東西集团寄予极大重视　义选民今日投票　军警全体出去维持治安　结果三四日内即可分晓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫數十七日廣播：羅馬訊，舉世矚目之義國選舉，即将於明日舉行，東西兩集團均寄予極大之重視。據一設觀測，蘇聯之政治企圖已無成功希望，衆料在此次選舉中義國共黨將獲總票數中之百分卅五，基督敎民主黨之加斯貝利大致將繼續担任總理，組織聯合政府，將共黨排斥在外。惟選舉之正式結果，大致須至星期三始能揭曉。按在歐洲復興計劃中，美國允予擬國相當可觀之經濟援助，惟如共黨獲勝，則此項援助將自動取消云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅屬十七日電〕義大科普選將於明日舉行投票現有三十萬以上武裝軍警鰲夜戒備，保證選舉時期之治安，特別注意米蘭及羅馬兩地廣塲。此次選舉為東西兩大勢大冷戰開始以來歐洲最重大事件。義大利將留在西方國家之列，抑將傾向蘇聯勢力下共產各國，可於此舉分曉。衆議院選舉結果，須至星期三揭曉，參議院選舉結果可望次日分曉。一般猜測加斯貝利之基督敎民主黨可得百分之卅五票，共黨領導之人民陣綫可得分之卅一票，其餘票數為其他各黨分得。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅為十七晶電〕將於十八日參加決定義大利未來命運的選投票之義利人民，今日安享一天投票前之政治休假日。各黨之競選運動均於十六日午夜正式結束。政界人士目前所關切者為星期日之氣候，如十六日夜開始之　雨，至十八日尙不停止，則對於共黨將　方利。蓋支持共黨之選　民不論晴雨，均均踴躍投票，至於其他選民恐有不少將因天雨而懶於出戶而棄權。基督民主黨領袖加斯貝利雅不願對選舉結果有所揣測，但曾向該黨幹部表示相信獲栗可超此等傳說，力言彼等法將接受人民之意志。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕英外部頃覆牒蘇聯，指蘇聯故意提出程序問題，以規避特港自由區歸還義大利一項建議之本質問題。英照會否認蘇聯照會中所稱由各主要關係强國開會討論此事為不民主之說，並要求蘇聯說明其所贊成者為何種程序。英照會並指出英政府建議在巴黎召開各主要關係國之初步會議，並不排除對義和約任何簽字國參加修改義和約討論之可能性。此一初步會議原亦僅為繼承起草和約時所採取之程序，和約固係先由外長會起草，然後由廿一國詳細審查，因此政英府認為蘇方所稱召開初步會議有背民主原則之說，並無根據。蘇聯政府茍能早日提出討論以特港歸還義國的實質問題之程序建議，英政府當樂於加以考慮</p>

<h3>用敵偽產穩定幣值　先自蘇浙皖區進行　國行正式函請中信局移交</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於將敵僞產業移作幣制基金事，國行方面對之雖表緘默，但實際上正在積極進行之中。國行已正式函請中信局將產權無問題之敵僞產業，移交國行作爲穩定幣値之基金。其產權尙有問題者，仍由中信局繼續處理，全部辦法正呈請政院核示中。國行並希望中信局於本月十八日之前，將全部敵偽產業以美金估價，但因事實上之困難，恐不能如期估竣。至於動用之敵僞產業範圍，原則上爲全國性，惟在蘇浙皖區域內者，產業價値最高，處理手續最淸楚，故先自此區域內着手進行。該區內之敵僞產業，根據上月之估價，已在二萬億國幣以上。</p>
<p>據有關人士表示：目前未售出之敵產，大部爲房產，且已在使用狀態中，論其本身之價値，自可加强法幣信用，但如欲將其出售，則爲另一問題，首先爲是否有買主，同時，敵產房屋內之住戶，如何遷移，亦成問題。逆產之問題更多，因將來大赦後，若干漢奸業主，將恢復其自由，其已沒收之產業，亦可能發生產權之糾紛也。</p>

<h3>飛將軍婚變案開審　庭長勸諭進行和解　杜琴表示寧死再不至王家</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「飛將軍」王倬與其妻杜琴婚變案，王控杜與譚約翰通姦，妨害家庭，前經地檢處提起公訴，昨晨地院首度開庭審理，鍾顯達庭長升座刑二庭後，首由吿訴人王倬陳述，三十五歲，崇明人，於民國二十四年與杜琴結婚，時在杭州箟橋航空學校任飛行敎官，翌年生一女孩，今年已十三歲。二十五年粵變發生，駐防廣州白雲機塲，杜亦同往。二十六年八一三滬戰爆發，渠任空軍二十四驅逐中隊分隊長，十月六日保衛首都空戰一役負傷，嗣調昆明空軍軍官學校任高級驅逐敎官，兼暫編驅逐隊　隊長。廿八年七月試飛俄式驅逐機，因機件發生故陣，墮地受重傷，雖經治療，惟一目失明</p>
<p>一目失明，一耳失聰，且神經錯亂。廿九二月政府送渠至香港療治，同年秋因香港受敵機威脅，乃由友人介紹得識中央無綫電桂林廠職員譚約翰同舟，向韶關撤退，小舟中晨夕相共，譚杜漸發生愛情，加之譚年靑貌美，對女人善於溫柔體貼，又無妻室，杜漸移愛於譚，至韶關分別時，杜竟爲之</p>
<p>掩面痛哭。廿九年九月抵昆明，　杜早在舟中密約利用無綫軍互通消息，於廿九年十二月十八日杜出走，並延請朱式南，王振亞二律師登報離婚，後經空軍副總司令王叔銘之勸吿，於卅年一月十日重行返家，至三十三年冬杜戀譚情熱，乘機私飛重慶，此時譚任職美陸軍新聞處電台，王發覺後飛至重慶尋獲，再度押返昆明，然夫妻間感情，業已破裂</p>
<p>業已破裂。三十四年底勝利後，渠率眷屬返滬，此時譚巳住祥生飯店守候，杜第三次出走，並登報聲明與王脫離同居關係，即潛赴天津與譚同居，杜改名譚黛珊，又名譚李秀華。嗣譚由經濟部派赴留美，卅七年元旦被王偵悉杜寓天津營口道豐業大樓A4號，前往尋獲，三度將杜押返家中，渠爲求一勞永逸計，向地檢處控譚妨害家庭</p>
<p>妨害家庭又因杜琴袒庇譚約翰，遂又追加杜為第二被吿。嗣提在押被吿杜琴質訊，杜着舊藍布旗袍，身材瘦小，形容憔悴，供稱：「二十九年十二月廿五日在昆明時，因受王虐待，曾協議離婚，經王叔銘將軍之調解，重歸於好，試行同居，當時由王倬親筆寫一字據，保證以後不再虐待，但事後王倬設法將該字據銷毀，變本加厲，日間不許吃飯，夜晚不許睡覺，不准哭，不准笑，使我哭笑不得</p>
<p>哭笑不得且時以手槍利刃迫我自殺，尙有種種變態行爲，將我視作妓女都不如，因爲有碍風化，不願多講。」供至此淚如雨下，泣不成聲，鍾　長當即勸以仍返夫家，進行和解，杜表示寗死不再至王家，繼由陳子　律師代表被吿辯護一過，末庭諭本案改期讀審，王飭回，杜仍還押。</p>

<h3>越俎代庖買賣婚姻　靑梅竹馬兩小鍾情</h3>
<p>陸堃山間　我是貴報的一個小顫聲者，今有一事，特來麻煩，就是我在去年的春單曲（即十七歲時）由親戚介紹來申習業，二月後接到家信，說已代我訂了親事，當時因被迫來中，還未有相當職業，免得人家說長道短，雖然我心裏不願意，但嘴上並未拒絕，最近又接家中來函，並未拒絕，最近又接家中來函，準備明舉行結婚，但在我早有了情人，自小說和她兄妹相稱，在父母而前，從未提及，現有法律問題數則，請愈在「社會服務」裏解答：（一）在未成人之前，由父母所定之婚約，未得本人同意，是否有效？（二）假使對方不肯解除此種婚約，如何對付？（三）婚約解除後，可否由自己擬定配偶，舉行結婚？</p>
<p>〔美國藩律師答〕（一）未成年人由父母代訂定之婚約，不必經未成年之同意，該項婚約依法有效。（二）如果對方不肯解除婚約，可拒絕結婚。（三）婚約除後，俟成年後，當可自由選擇，否則仍應得父母之同意為合法。</p>

<p>倦怠於塵囂的人們來歸了，一批又一批。他們讚頌湖波的柔靜，他們也神往堤柳的新綠，憑弔岳武穆，悼念蘇小小；峯　澗底，溪畔泉邊，片刻放眼，換到的是愉快？抑是舒適？是永恆的憧憬？抑是心底的溫存？沒有一個人能道出春深西子存在於他心頭的誘惑！</p>
<p>在湖邊，那霧籠的晨曦，柳林深處的燈火，那遼闊的雲天，悠長靜寂的塔影，曾寄托了幾許遊人的懷念！自然所賦予西湖的風姿太深淳了，何況又是暮春三月！</p>
<p>流連吧！長使西子秀色跟隨着你的記憶！這原是一段如何可貴的記憶啊！（本報記者俞創　攝）</p>

<h3>小城</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>雖然住在大城市，卻永遠在嚮往着小城，也許這正是配合了所謂「小資產階級」乎？自己也莫明其妙。</p>
<p>我也實在佩服那些運籌維幄的巨商大賈，他們的頭腦整天在金鈔上打算盤而不疲乏，這的確是一種修養。若說忍耐，這也未嘗不可算是其一。近來我看某一方型刊物上的卡通，把商人描得肚皮大而頭腦奇小，作家描得頭奇大而腹部萎縮，其實這是不對的，生意人頭腦可謂最發達，作家才是沒有頭腦，我們仿效孟子一句話，「堯舜豈無所用其心哉，亦不用於耕耳！」「作家豈無所用其心哉，亦不用於錢耳。」可是不用於錢，就等於無所用心，因為沒有錢就沒有一切！在大都市衝來撞去，總出不了這些勢力的樊籠，不必走在大馬路行人道上才有被大卡車軋死的危險，即使是閉門而坐，也有被軋死的可能，蓋縱軀壳不被軋，精神血汗總是在被人軋也。</p>
<p>陶彭澤的詩：「悮入塵網中，一去三十年，久在樊籠裏，復得返自然，」這意思說得多真切，然而我們卻沒有那佩在山林看雲海，或看飛鳥的草廬，主要也還是因為我們所入的塵網不深，未能由五斗米升至二千石，在名勝之區租一別墅。所以五柳先生在我們眼中還是奢侈之至，即使都是小布爾喬亞，他也是佼佼者了。有了那麼一所門前有五柳樹，屋後有桑榆，屋前有桃李，有犬吠有鵝嗚的宅第，又何必汲汲五斗米？何況還有五十畝種秫之田，可以大吃老酒呢？</p>
<p>意識上是布爾喬亞，事實在財產上乃真正的普羅之我們，這個歲月真正霉得透頂，左右作人難，所以我只有覺得從罪惡的大都市逃避了好，若果真有世外桃源的話，恐怕「欣然規往」的萬萬不止我一個！連呵斥我的人，也未必不動心。</p>
<p>人都是有些自我膨脹的，大都市給我們的卻只有壓迫，不但大腹便便的大亨是每個人的閻羅王，就是那十層以上的遮暗天日的高樓，對我們又何嘗不是一種威脅？走在南京路或霞飛路等，常常感到透不過氣來，外灘若不是一面臨江，其對人之脅迫感恐怕更大。若在小城市則不會有這些怪東西。那種一面泥土墻壁造成的假洋樓我們可以嗤之以鼻，等於不存在，舊式的平屋與古老的台閣又是那麼平易近人和弘敞，我們住在裏邊只覺得博大而親切，種種都有一般溫暖的勁兒，雖則那板壁沒有水門汀不透風。走到大街上更可以前後無所禁忌，用不着東張西望，你總還有兩件體面些的衣服，穿起來就可以使洋貨店老板對你起敬，若是賣書報的地方更會向你攀談，聽說你是從上海或南京來的，總該帶給他們一點新聞罷？若有市集就更佳，鄉下人的菜蔬和都市的花洋布，賤價的化妝品在交換，張宗子在「西湖香市」中所寫的「士女　都，不勝其村裝野婦之喬畫，鼎　光怪，不勝其泥人竹馬之行情」，頗能道出一種泥土氣的繁華，而且鄉下又根本沒有令人作　的　雅士女，與百無一用的骨董書晝，到是那些健康而簡單的人情，給我們若干啟示與教訓。假使中國還有文化的話，想必該當在這裏，而不在跳舞場與會樂里之類，這乃是一點民族的元氣，——被大都市吸乾了殘存的一點元氣，你不是看到學者們在提倡鄉土還原論了嗎？我不會說什麼理論，只是直覺的感到小城市比大都市好，你以為如何？</p>
<h3>落花</h3>
<p>— 平公</p>
<p>枕上聞雨聲瀟瀟，推紙窗視之，庭前櫻花零落且盡，殘瓣繽紛如茵，因憶晏元獻「然可奈何花落去」之句。按歐陽修歸田錄云：「晏元獻公以文章名譽，少年居富貴，性豪俊，所至延賓客，一時名士多出其門，罷樞密副使，為南京留守，時年三十八，幕下王琪張亢最為上客。」主琪（君玉）即以「似曾相識燕歸來」之對受知於元獻者也。元獻三十八歲時，當為宋仁宗天聖六年，西曆一〇二八年。衡之西史，尚在諾曼地人侵英（Norman　Conquest1066）前三十八年，此時英國文人有錦心绣口如元獻者乎？</p>
<p>英國十七世紀玄秘詩派諾作，看似艱澀，細味之卻覺纏綿蘊藉。唐氏（Donne）之外，海立克（Herrick）亦不惡。海詩「給處女們」首　（“Gather　ye　rase-buds…”）與「花開堪折直須折……」一首，意境絕似，然又落後了多少年？</p>
<p>唐氏之詩，恰似我國之詞，着墨不多，而剝繭抽絲，餘味不盡。唐氏善言情，善取　，重意象，皆與我國之詞有似處。然我國和尚，卻從不如此大犯綺語之戒，而唐氏固和尚也。</p>
<p>因又想到方外人偷情。余極愛孽海記「思凡」一折文字之美，寫小尼姑不耐青燈寂寥，意馬心猿，遂覺怒目金剛，亦復含情脈脈，此真空即是色矣。然「下山」即傖俗可壓，與「思凡」筆墨逈不相侔，不知何故。至西洋文學中寫方外人偷情者，則實以白朗寗之「李波·李比師兄」（Fra　Lippo　Lippi）一詩最佳，李比和尚固確曾有其人，以畫馳名，而白朗寗乃於數百年後，以蘊藉瀟洒之筆，獨寫某偷情被執一節，不特風致絕佳，亦富音節之美也。</p>
<p>余在昆明時，輒與燕卜葉教授泛舟滇池，一日，燕先生與余皆薄醉，在舟中竟以白朗寗與密爾頓之優劣而大爭鬧。燕先生，當代英國之　詩人也，好飲酒，不修邊幅，而讀書極多，過目不忘。是日，乃于滇池中高吟密爾頓失樂園達一百餘行，以見密爾頓之佳，蓋其時余適譽白勃寧為有情致，而據密爾頓之　滯。然燕先生固為一極有意思之人，若余繩密爾頓之美而短白朗寗者，彼必又引出大段白朗寗來示威矣。事後，余乃撰一長文，仍揚白朗寗而抑密爾頓如故，以呈燕先生，竟亦頗承謬贊。前聞胡適之先生云：燕先生結婚了，且已返北大任教。今日見報，此大教授有罷教之舉，燕先生大可偷閑暢飲幾日，舊京白乾，價不昂而質甚美也。</p>
<h3>燒飯</h3>
<p>— 碩甫</p>
<p>凡是煮飯的，大概不寫文章，而寫文章的，也許用不到身親煮飯這一類瑣事。因此，筆者撰寫這篇小文，心頭別有一番滋味，可以說是一件平凡而頗偶然的小事。</p>
<p>記得我在二十九歲的那一年，才開始學習煮飯。那時我和一位陳君，同住在某公司附設的宿舍內。樓下就是某某記廚房，點菜很方便，可是它祇供給菜而沒有飯。起初我們總是打發茶房到馬路對過某廣東伙食店去買「白飯」，後來茶房一度請假回去，後來他的打雜工作又比以前忙碌，分不出身來。我和陳君就合買了一個風爐和飯鍋，自然還買了一些米，就這樣嘗試着自己煮飯來吃。</p>
<p>最初的成績很不好。不是沒有煮熟，就因為太性急，時時將鍋子揭開來看，水蒸氣給逃跑出來，結果飯卻煮焦了。</p>
<p>米中所加的水，也有一定分寸。加得太多，固然稀爛的不能適口，加得太少，煮熟後也不免過硬，難以下咽。這裏有一個訣巧，大約在米的上面，加了約食指第一節深淺的水就可煮得軟硬適中了。</p>
<p>附帶可以一提的，在鍋子中放多少米，也是一個小問題。通常以大半鍋為宜，因為米是有漲性的。盛得太滿，煮熟後，就要從鍋中漲到外邊來，鍋子本身於無法容納了。我嘗在好萊塢某喜劇中，見到某女主角在煤汽爐上煮飯，想必米放得太多的關係，煮熟後，接連從鍋子中湧了出來，滿地狼藉不堪。如果真有這種事，自然是很糟而且也很窘的。</p>
<p>最近，我已用不到自己下廚煮飯。可是我很服膺常親小勞的這句養身格言。偶然興起，頗以煮飯為消遺的一道。在不懂得煮飯以前，彷彿是一件難事，煮了一二次後，就覺得這是一椿很簡單的工作。我想在都市中的人，玩膩了打牌，跳舞與看戲之餘，嘗試煮飯，也是一項有趣的小經騐。獨身漢更能省去不少上飯店的開支，不失為一項額外收獲呢。</p>
<h3>海紅樓詩錄</h3>
<p>— 徐半夢</p>
<p>齒動吟</p>
<p>脣破語尚能，齒搖　無恃，自從蹈海來，五年落兩齒。久知剛必折，亦雀老已邇，不問精與粗，　論甘與旨。有如償負債，一起復一起，白米填饑腸，黃金化遺矢，三餐三度償，結　到身死。我思富貴人，窮奢尤極侈，富人設一筵，　足三月粃，酒肉臭朱門，凍骨滿冷市，原非天不仁，亦非人不恥，遭逢業果來，苦樂便開始。我髪方復衰，我齒亦巳圯，脫落聽自然，動靜不憂喜，晴窗春日上，照我耐嚼舐。</p>
<p>名將</p>
<p>天山大漠振雄圖，灼灼刀光映赤膚，萬里悲風吹鐵騎，三更大雪壓飛狐。牙旗影　冰紋簇，寶帳燈昏酒胆粗，正有嫖姚名將在，不教關內走驍胡。</p>
<h3>全世界最奇怪的旅店</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>全世界最奇怪的旅店，在天津市的「三不管」。在北方，不比南方人可以冬夜露宿而不致一定凍死，為了保全人的生命，乃應運產生了一種旅店，那是百分之百的「旅」店，專供住宿，白天不能躭的。其設備為破爛大屋一間，沿牆根挖穴數十，約可容人，旅客來投宿，便把身子倒裝在穴內，僅把頭部露在外面，旁立夥計持鏟而待，客已入穴，便立刻鏟一鏟沙使客人的項部掩蓋住。原來地下層是夏涼冬暖的，在北方的地下室——當然不是石地而是土地，冬天可不生爐子而不感寒冽，如此一來，頭以下密封在洞內，至少不至凍死了。人類真是彈性的動物，無論如何赤貧，會想出辦法。有被有褥而不生火取暖，在北中國仍然無法睡眠的，故北方有檢煤核的老太婆，說明了即使無辦法購媒，都不能不在人家傾倒了的垃圾中，去覓取燃料，雖然其難一如淘金沙然。</p>
<p>這樣一來，便可以都省了，無榻，無爐，無被褥的乞兒苦力等仍然可以熟睡一夜。每人取費，在十年前是大銅子－枚，約大洋一分弱。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十四章　逍遙海上　（一二九）</p>
<p>渚齋見肖柏的一篇話，過於偏見，想要駁他幾句，因為他是長親，又不敢說，只連連應道：「是！是！過兩天，我到姑丈府上，看綺紈的信。」肖柏道：「那很好，你以後要常到我家，我給你說點戲，剛才我聽你唱那段玉堂春，嗓子仍然很甜潤，只是咬字還有不對，我有工夫慢慢指點你，將來有天綺紈回來，見你唱工進步，一定很高興。」肖柏說完，接着哈哈大笑，渚齋給他如此－來，弄得哭笑不得，肖柏又邀他到來今雨軒喝茶，渚齋只得陪他前去，想起當日初次遇見綺紈時，也是在來今雨軒喝茶，今天和肖柏重來，而意中人在千里之外，口裏雖和肖柏敷衍，心上非常惆悵。肖拍喝過紅茶，又吃一點點心，才和渚齋出園，渚齋眼看肖柏上車走了，自己沿着馬路旁，慢慢走着，心裏只是轉念綺執，把肖柏給他那封信，重由衣袋拿出來，邊走邊看，心中只覺難過，覺得綺紈這人太委曲，太多情，他完全為我犧性，肖柏曲解她的心理，太沒道理，不曉老父看了這封信，作如何感想，縱使老人家能表同情，能體諒她，於她有何好處，她說她無面目重回北平，再見同業，這話是如何凄婉，她又說希望老父能永久隱瞞我，不要叫我知道她的隱情，免我苦惱，用心如何體貼，如何細緻。她設夜鬧人靜，百感交集，淚濕枕衾，這是如何的凄楚，綺紈我真害了你了，我苦了你，我的良心是過不去的，渚齋拿着信，一面看，一面走，全神都注在信上，不意剛走過三座門，一輛大卡車載着許多士兵，由公安街，斜刺地猛開過去，及到喇叭嚮時，渚齋想要躲避，巳來不及，汽軍猛衝過來，被撞倒地上。</p>
<h3>一口痰的代價</h3>
<p>— 鏡明</p>
<p>有一個朋友方自香港回來，他同我們談起，那裏已在嚴格底推行着禁止隨地吐痰的運勸。任何一個人，如在公共場所或街道上被發現違背了這項規則（禁止隨地吐痰），便將要捉到警察局，而科以港幣一百元的罰款。這筆罰金就任何貨幣而論，是相當可觀的，特別是拿我們中國的法幣來計算。他說，這就是為什麼在香港能切實的做到不隨地吐痰的原因。</p>
<p>從全世界對付隨地吐痰最嚴厲的處所找來，我們相信，當推紐約州的勃魯克林城。那邊，每輛公共汽車上的進口處，都張貼着醒目的公告。任何一個人在公共汽車上，如發現觸犯了這項規則（禁止隨地吐痰），他依法便當被科美金五百元的罰款，或一年的徒刑，甚或二者併科。</p>
<p>然而反顧我們上海，禁止隨地吐痰的運動，早已傳遍遐邇，可是到底只聞樓梯響，還不見人下來呢！（譯自大陸報）</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>只有在猛暴的烈風中，我們才知道海洋上的船隻，那個是飄搖的？那個是要沉沒的？那些個是能夠安穩航行的？……</p>
<p>開在暖室裏的薔薇是不幸的，因為辜負了它的美麗的刺。</p>
<p>水上的浮萍，聚了會散，散了也仍然會聚的，只是時間的早晚而已。</p>
<p>但是，如果離開了水面，那就一切都完了。</p>
<h3>雷伎荟</h3>
<p>見到金山寺遭大火化為灰燼的新聞，不禁大驚失色。此名蹟叢林，且美術之宮，亦槯浩刧乎？應援歷史之筆，大書曰：「民國三十有七年四月六日，鎮江金山寺災。「史書退偉大建築遭祝融之厄，如此紀載法，其意義不止於被損害物之本身，而實為「天人交警」之一切的表徵。比二十餘年前，杭州倒了「雷峰塔」更為重大。</p>
<p>「金焦萬古鎮中流」，「金山一點大如拳」，所以膾炙人口者，一大半是為了「金山寺」。金山寺又有法海和尚，許宣與白蛇的故事，一番「仙凡戀愛」的奇情豔迹。由西湖演到長江，由神話而演成戲劇，並且成了梅蘭芳李世芳師徒合演的最後紀念（李在上海演「金山寺」小青後，乘機北返至青島遇難），是亦此寺哀豔小史之一頁。</p>
<p>金山寺的古物，如諸葛行軍之鼓，東坡的玉帶，文徵明的手卷精圖，均告無恙，自是不幸中之幸。</p>
<p>又聞寺主太滄和尚發願重建，定期復興。適讀曲園老人俞樾文集蘇杭兩地名剎，洪楊兵火所毀，一則重修完好，一則未複舊觀，其記蘇州寶積寺云：郡城黃土搭橋之東，梁天監時建，道光中衡峰和尚修，　構觕定，大亂洊至，皓壁丹柱，化為邱城。同治之初，三吳底定，衡峰眷言靈宇，載　興葺，克成初願。三門岌　，大殿恢閎，菩薩羅漢諸天色相，功在不捨，卒底於成，地之興衰，固存乎人哉。其記杭州凈慈寺云：創始於吳越，宋紹興間改名，為西湖第一叢林。咸豐之季，毀於兵火，鞠為茂草，同治時寺儈大圓謀修復之，迄無所就。後有雪舟者，自聖因寺移主淨慈，因山為屋，高高下下，具有畫意，終未能全復舊觀。是則名剎復建，有成有不成，有遲有速，事在人為，和尚勉之！</p>
<p>相傳明祖與老僧，同在金山，俯覽過往船隻如梭，泊山腳船桅如林；歎賞無邊盛景。僧言只有兩船，一為「名」，一為「利」，真乃包掃一切，喚醒世人不少。又傳清康熙南巡至此，欲題御碑，與其隨侍文學之臣，煞費推敲，乃得「江天一　」四字，確是氣象萬千，是脫胎於滕　閣序「秋水共長天一色」，可謂運古入化。報載，大雄殿羅漢堂，許多丈六金身，雕梁　棟，俱付刧灰，惟高塔及法海洞未殃入，不知此碑亭運命如何。又清初所成四庫全書，有七閣庋　，「文淵」「文溯」「文津」「文源」「文匯」「文宗」「文瀾」是也。內「文宗閣」則在金山寺，　凡三萬六千冊，皆殿　大　，充塞棟宇，極為壯觀，久已無人道及了。</p>

<h3>國大，中醫之建議</h3>
<p>— 丁濟萬</p>
<p>余等此次參與國大，深知關於中醫藥之興替，責任綦重，特提出改進中國醫藥之建議四點，以告關心諸同道之前。</p>
<p>一，提高衛生部中醫委員會職權，授權該會，隨時召集各省市中醫師公會決定重要醫藥行政及興革事宜。</p>
<p>二，依據部頒中醫專科學校課程表，驚設國立中醫專校，並補助私立優良之中醫專校，以提倡中國醫學。</p>
<p>三，設國立國藥研究院，徵集有效藥物及成方，加以提煉取精，發揮中藥之特效。</p>
<p>四，各地衛生機關，應與各地中醫師公會聯繫，籌設公立中醫院，獎勵私立中醫院之設立。沈仲理</p>
<h3>婦女頭痛頭暈症　與貧血子宮病之關係</h3>
<p>— 沈仲理</p>
<p>婦女頭痛頭暈一症，不時發現，十中九人患此，表面看似無關，實則內病暗伏，發則重篤，不及服藥，書謂女子以肝爲先天，肝藏血，血虛肝陽上升，於是發爲頭痛眩暈之疾，且以女性之神經，本較男性爲過敏，按生理上言之，生殖器神經之分佈，與腦脊髓相連鎖，故生殖器病變，可能引起腦神經刺激，其症狀有太陽頭痛，眉稜骨痛，鼻準痛，半邊頭痛等，或頭暈目花，劇烈者每有突然卒倒。至其主要之病因，諸如月經來潮，懷孕停經，失眠心跳，白帶來多，房事過度，病後失調，或患重篤之子宮癌者，此種症候，特別顯著，亦有每月發一次，如痛經然，是謂定期性頭痛，平日須注意靜養，開豁胸懷，治療方面，除應顧及主症外，對於此症，宜予養血平肝，鎭潛虛陽，如石次明左牡蠣磁石玳瑁夕利白芍枸杞首烏之藥，重則非羚羊粉龍齒之品，不易奏效也、</p>
<h3>上海中醫院之旣往與將來</h3>
<p>— 程國樹</p>
<p>余臨診之暇，嘗慨夫疾病痛苦，人所難免，延醫服藥，理所當然，惟每見輕病轉重，由重轉危，或病後反覆，終至不救者，抑何故歟，竊思其理，約有三因；商店雇員，工廠職工，旅食在外，孤獨無依，一有疾患，勢必呻吟牀第，舉目形單，藥爐茶鐺，侍奉乏人，此看護之不週，而致病勢之轉劇者，此其一。普通市民，設患傳染疾病，一家數口，勢必次第相傳，同時幷發，此環境之不良，而使病勢之轉劇者，此其二。病情之變化莫測，親友之探望頻繁，人聲囂擾，每使病者感心身之不安，或飲食無忌，暈膻雜進，此常識之缺乏，而使病勢之轉劇者，此其三。余有鑒於斯，所以有上海中醫院之驚設也。</p>
<p>三十一年秋，擇定北京西路五九四號，即今之院址是也，積極規劃，佈置一切，翌年三月十一日，乃正式揭幕，添設施診部，且由新聞報社會服務欄，特約本院收容免費病人，所以爲社會謀福利，盡醫院之職責也。三十六年八月，因住院者日衆，病房不敷分配，曾添設病室，以適應環境之需要，美化醫院之觀瞻。今値本院誕生五週紀念之期，緬懷旣往，固不敢自詡其成，而殫智竭慮，自當惕勵於來茲，惟有一本初衷，貫澈始終，對於今後之願望，約可得而言者，在改進方面，務求融會中西，取長捨短，務使診斷準確，治騐迅速，尙冀社會賢達，同道先進，予以提携協助，此則同人等所馨香蘄求者也。</p>

<h3>中醫外科之特長</h3>
<p>— 朱仁康</p>
<p>一般人心止中，認爲西醫欄手術，殊不知中醫外科特長處正多，北可得撮略言之，以吿世人。中醫外科有內消方法，何謂內消，例如起一腫痬，中醫每外敷特效膏藥，內服消散之劑，每能使腫毒消退於無形，得免開刀化膿，尤對於慢性外症，如流注之此竄彼潰，瘰　痰核之結塊累累，西醫割治無功，中醫即有賴此內消方法，使之潛移默化，此其特長之一也。</p>
<p>更如疔瘡及發背對口，失治輙有走黃及內陷之危險，西醫所謂敗血症及膿腺毒症，中醫如遇此等病症，外敷以吊毒，內則投以頂透消腫，使瘡毒限局於一隅，祇使局部化膿泄毒，不致蔓延擴大轉人內臟，化險爲夷，此其特長之二也。</p>
<p>此外特長尙多，限於篇幅，未克詳談，容暇續之。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Personally Reports to National Assembly, Urges Delegates to Uphold Discipline and Bear Heavy Responsibility as Models of Democratic Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Chairman Chiang delivered a four-minute speech to the First Review Committee at the National Assembly Hall at 6:22 PM on the 17th. The Chairman, dressed in military fatigues, first went to the registration desk at the National Assembly at 5:30 PM to register, receiving badge number 2765. He then proceeded to the Presidium Office. At 6:10 PM, he took his seat on the government officials' bench and witnessed the aftermath of the chaotic scene. He waited until the adjournment to speak. The Chairman stated that he was speaking as a citizen. He briefly said: This first National Assembly was achieved only after the deaths of countless martyrs and the efforts of countless people over the past 37 years. The two major responsibilities of the National Assembly are: (1) to implement the constitution, suppress the rebellion, and build the nation; (2) to serve as a permanent model for future National Assemblies. This heavy responsibility must be shouldered by every delegate. As I see it, the current situation is very pessimistic for democratic constitutionalism. We must be models of democratic constitutionalism and not leave any stains on it. As a citizen, I urge all delegates to take responsibility, uphold discipline, and maintain order in the assembly hall. I hope that the situation we saw today will not be repeated in the future, otherwise the credibility of the National Assembly delegates will be damaged, and people at home and abroad will feel pessimistic. The Chairman's words were extremely sincere. The entire venue was silent during his speech, a stark contrast to the uproar of a few minutes earlier. The Chairman was greeted with enthusiastic cheers as soon as he finished speaking. Members of both the Min and Qing parties also applauded and supported him. The Chairman then expressed his gratitude and left.</p>
<h3>Director-General Chiang Convenes a Discussion Meeting, Encouraging Kuomintang National Assembly Delegates to Consider the Constitution as Unamendable</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] At 2:30 PM on the 17th, Kuomintang Director-General Chiang Kai-shek convened a discussion meeting with the party's comrades among the National Assembly delegates at the National Defense Ministry Auditorium. After listening to the opinions of various party members on matters related to the constitution, Director-General Chiang delivered an earnest speech encouraging all comrades to respect the party's traditional spirit, cherish the party's fifty-year struggle history, and understand the country's current needs. Regarding the constitution, it is advisable to follow the party's established policy, and except for temporary clauses related to the suppression of rebellion, it should be considered unamendable. All comrades were deeply moved after listening to the instructions and unanimously accepted Director-General Chiang's guidance. The discussion meeting ended at 3:15 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The National Assembly held its eleventh meeting on the 17th. At 10:00 AM, Chairman Qin Dechun announced the start of the day's agenda. First, Zhang Yingshu, representative of the First Review Committee, reported that the full-day review meeting on the 16th had yielded no results. This was because the review process yesterday involved a broad discussion, with 110 people requesting to speak, but only 32 speakers were heard. Therefore, the review should continue today. The chairman then proposed, according to Article 47 of the Rules of Procedure, that since the First Review Committee's constitutional amendment proposal had not reached a conclusion, it could not be submitted to the second reading. He asked whether the assembly needed to change the agenda. After a vote, with 1,877 people present, 1,409 voted in favor, a majority passage. At 10:20 AM, the chairman announced the adjournment of the assembly, and the review committees continued to meet separately.</p>
<h3>In Times of Rebellion Suppression and to Cope with Contingencies, the President May Take Emergency Measures; Amendment Review Committee Passes Comprehensive Report</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The First Review Committee convened at 11:00 AM on the 17th, with Luo Wenwu presiding. Before Luo took the chair, Hu Shi, the chairman of the delegation, first presented a report stating that the original convener of the First Review Committee expressed his apology for the lack of conclusion in yesterday's discussion, and the entire group resigned in protest. After persuasion, they were reluctantly reinstated. After the chairman took office, he first apologized, then made two points: (1) the proceedings should be conducted in accordance with the rules of procedure; (2) order should be maintained in the assembly hall, and both sides of opinions should be freely expressed; (3) the chairman personally has no prejudice. Finally, he inquired about the method of speaking, whether to adopt a broad expression of opinions or to speak on each case item by item. The majority still believed that a broad review should be conducted. However, there were many free speakers in the assembly hall, most of whom believed that it was not necessary to go beyond the scope of the proposal in order to quickly end the discussion. However, Wang Peiji of the Democratic Socialist Party suddenly went to the podium and shouted that the establishment of a proposal has a certain procedure, that is, it can only be proposed after being co-signed by one-fifth of the representatives. Now it is found that there is a distinction between "big representatives" and "small representatives" in the assembly hall, and big representatives can sign on behalf of small representatives. Wang's attitude and wording were improper, and some representatives raised criticisms. For a time, the assembly hall was in chaos, with a clamor both on and off the stage. In the clamor, party consciousness was also extremely strong. After the chairman repeatedly called for the maintenance of order in the assembly hall, Wang and other representatives went off the stage and took their seats. The chairman then announced that Wang's wording was inappropriate and would be handed over to the Representatives Disciplinary Committee for handling. After the storm passed, Lin Zigui shouted loudly that the most urgent and necessary thing had happened, that is, at the time of the debate over amending the constitution and not amending it, there was a matter of abandoning the constitution happening outside the assembly hall, that is, more than 20 signing representatives came to petition and were surrounded by the police. Before Lin finished speaking, there was a snort from the stage, and Lin failed to achieve his speaking purpose and stepped down. The review then began. Qian Tianren suddenly called out "impeach the chairman," but ultimately failed to get a response and there was no further development. Zhang Danping and others continued to speak, still mostly taking the two points of supporting constitutional amendments and opposing constitutional amendments as the focus. Zhang Danping first stated: We advocate amending Article 27 of the constitution, which only increases the powers of the National Assembly. We believe that we must support any political party that can give power to the people; otherwise, we do not want it. Zhang explained the procedure for impeaching the president and vice president, first requiring a petition for impeachment signed by two-fifths of the representatives, announced thirty days later, then sent to the Legislative Yuan for proposal, and finally impeached by the National Assembly. Zhang believes that the National Assembly must have the right to free assembly. Zhu Shilie said: There is a situation in the assembly hall, that is, the party is above everything else. I am a member of the Kuomintang, but today I am speaking from the standpoint of an ordinary representative. He believes that amending Article 27 to expand the powers of the National Assembly does not shake the entire constitution. Zhu also said that if the Communist Party reaches the door, we will not be able to withstand it. Liu Yiting spoke, expressing support for increasing the powers of the National Assembly and temporary clauses. Tian Keming pointed out that overseas Chinese elections are not in line with reality and need to be amended, and that some issues are necessary for facts, so he supports the amendment, believing that it will not shake the entire constitution. The amendment passed today will not be implemented from today, and there is still a public announcement period in between. At this time, it was 12:00 noon, and the chairman announced the adjournment. The meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, with Lin Bin as the chairman. The scene was still in an uproar. It was not until around 6:00 PM in the evening that Chairman Chiang arrived in plain clothes, and then it was quiet. The comprehensive review report submitted was then voted on and passed. The content included the temporary clauses authorizing the President and the establishment of the National Assembly's temporary session, while other proposed constitutional amendments would be discussed at the temporary session. The passed review report is recorded as follows: This review committee has reviewed the constitutional amendment cases, and it is believed that during this period of rebellion suppression, the temporary clauses proposed by Representative Mo Dehui and others are indeed necessary, and the convocation of the National Assembly temporary session should also be determined so that other proposed constitutional amendments can be properly discussed and decided during the temporary session. Based on the above intentions, it is proposed to add an item to the original proposal of Representative Mo Dehui et al. The following full text is respectfully adopted by the Assembly and transferred to the second and third readings.</p>
<p>Temporary Clauses for the Period of Rebellion Suppression.</p>
<p>In accordance with the procedure in Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, the temporary clauses for the period of rebellion suppression are formulated as follows: During the period of rebellion suppression, in order to avoid national or public emergencies or to cope with major financial and economic changes, the President may take emergency measures with the decision of the Executive Yuan meeting, without being restricted by the procedures stipulated in Articles 39 or 43 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan may change or repeal the aforementioned emergency measures in accordance with the procedure stipulated in Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The end of the period of rebellion suppression shall be announced by the President or by the Legislative Yuan requesting the President to announce it.</p>
<p>The first National Assembly shall be convened by the President before December 25, 1950, to discuss relevant constitutional amendment cases. If the period of rebellion suppression has not been announced to end in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, the National Assembly temporary session shall decide whether the temporary clauses should be extended or repealed.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Fourth Review Committee continued to meet on the 17th, morning and afternoon, to review proposals related to the national economy, all chaired by Weng Wenhao. All 25 proposals were approved after review, with the proposals on requisitioning the assets of wealthy families, implementing land reform, and reforming the currency system being the most important. Regarding the proposals on requisitioning the assets of wealthy families and reforming the currency system, the review method of the 16th was followed, with separate merged discussions. The principles were approved, and the government was recommended to formulate measures for requisitioning the assets of wealthy families within three months, earnestly implement them, and announce the results.</p>
<p>For currency system reform, it was recommended that the government establish a currency system reform research committee in the short term to study reform measures. Regarding land reform, there were: (1) Chen Xihuan and others proposed immediately formulating a land reform plan, implementing "land to the tiller," and expanding the amount of agricultural loans to stabilize the lives of farmers and facilitate the suppression of rebellion; (2) Luo Dafan and others proposed recommending that the government quickly change the land system to clear the roots of chaos and complete the Three Principles of the People; (3) Shao Hongji and others proposed organizing land within a time limit, improving the rural system, increasing production, and rationally distributing it to lay the foundation for people's livelihood and consolidate the foundation of the country; (4) Cui Shuxian and others proposed requesting the government to immediately implement land reform throughout the country, so that the tiller has his own land, realize the equalization of land ownership in the Three Principles of the People, to eliminate the source of the communist bandits and save the already falling tide. The four cases were merged for discussion, passed as they were, and the government was recommended to organize a land reform research committee to study implementation measures and earnestly implement them. In addition, six proposals related to economic policy were passed. When discussing the proposal by Zhang Tifang and others to request the government to improve coal regulation, the representatives greatly criticized the government's regulation policy. A northern representative said that the government's regulation of food prevented the transport of southern grain to the north, resulting in a lack of food in major northern cities. He spoke with passion and stomped his feet, almost weeping. As a result, the case was passed and sent to the government for attention and improvement. Finally, a proposal was passed to require the government to promptly conduct property registration in preparation for conducting a one-time property tax in the future.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The eleventh meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 AM on the 17th, with 1,955 representatives present. The seventh group of the Presidium took turns presiding, with Qin Dechun presiding. He led all representatives in a minute of silence for the late Representative Kong Xianrong. After the silence, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou read the emergency motion proposed by the Northeast representatives for the death of Representative Kong Xianrong. The content explained that the death of Representative Kong, and the fear that his remaining subordinates would be used by the rebel bandits, suggested that the government quickly send a telegram of condolences and immediately incorporate them to strengthen the rebellion suppression force.

Secondly, local armed forces should be developed, and the government should be required to rescue the Northeast with a large army to protect the country.

His old department will be reorganized by Deputy Director Wan Fulin to continue Kong's rebellion suppression legacy, Zhongzheng." The assembly then passed the temporary emergency motion to be sent to the National Government for handling.</p>
<h3>Kong Requested Military Power, Military Expresses Ignorance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Anti-Japanese General and current National Assembly Representative Kong Xianrong committed suicide on the 15th. According to reporters from military sources, Kong's revolutionary struggle went as follows: After the victory of the War of Resistance, Kong Xianrong's troops and guns, more than 5,000, were compiled by the former Northeast Security Commander's Office into the Northeast Security Infantry Second Detachment, with Kong as the commander of the detachment and concurrently the commander of the Jilin, Liaoning, and Anbian border areas. The detachment was originally under the command of Liang Huasheng and fought near Yongji. In September 1947, Liang sent someone to inspect the troops, and there were too many vacancies in the troops. It was reported that the troops should be reorganized according to the actual number of people. Kong then went to Shenyang in person and stated that the troops were scattered due to the war and were not easy to concentrate, and that the cadres of the troops were all called by him during the War of Resistance and could be called his own soldiers. Chen, the concurrent director, comforted him and specially allowed the detachment to be retained without change. In October of the same year, the troops fought near Jilin. Kong was in Pan due to an event. The troops were ambushed and suffered heavy losses. Kong resigned due to the scattering of troops and a negative attitude and asked to be transferred to the Xingyuan service. His request was approved and he was appointed as a high-level staff member of the Xingyuan. The remnants of the troops were transferred to the Jilin Security Brigade for reinforcement. It was also reported that Kong went to Nanjing and repeatedly appealed to the government, 力陳 the crisis in the Northeast, hoping to be given the opportunity to regain military power, but to no avail. However, the Ministry of National Defense did not receive any requests or reports from Kong.</p>

<h3>Sunday Forum: How to Cultivate an Excellent Academic Atmosphere!</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jixi</p>
<p>To cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere, we must first understand the reasons for the decline of the current "academic atmosphere." According to the author's observation, those who run schools and teach do not emphasize the cultivation of their own personality and the advancement of their knowledge. Some even lack the virtue to influence people and the knowledge to convince the public. When unexpected events occur, they use high-pressure tactics to deal with energetic, courageous, and sacrificing young students. They do not realize that these students cannot be suppressed by status or subdued by authority. Others use flowery words and clever arguments to deceive and lure them, not knowing that these students have pure thoughts and correct views, and cannot be deceived by empty words or enticed by great profits. Coupled with the exploitation and instigation of professional students, student movements such as strikes inevitably erupt. Therefore, to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere, the education authorities should appoint first-class scholars with extensive knowledge, great abilities, and high moral character as university presidents. The president should respectfully invite famous teachers with noble character and specialized knowledge to serve as excellent mentors for young students in their studies and lives. Their scholarship, work ethic, treatment of others, and even every word and action can serve as models for young people. This is an educational method of influencing character through personal example rather than words. The power of this kind of education is not only a driving force for young students to be ambitious, studious, virtuous, and diligent, sufficient to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere, but also to transform society and change customs. Therefore, this is the best way to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>The rule of law in schools and the democratization of education are also good ways to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere. For example, the private Patriotic School, founded by Mr. Cai Yuanpei as the principal and Mr. Wu Jingheng as the academic supervisor during the late Qing Dynasty, allowed students to govern the school according to law. Students were like legislators, and faculty and staff were like executors. Teachers and students taught each other, shared joys and sorrows, and loved each other like family members, truly like a large family. Later, when Mr. Cai presided over Peking University, he also allowed student autonomy, eventually making it a top institution with the most excellent academic atmosphere and the greatest contribution to scholarship. Recently, the author met with Mr. Li Zhipu, the former director of training at the Rural Reconstruction Academy, in Beijing. He said that he also adopted the spirit of student legislation, law enforcement, and self-government to cultivate the school's excellent academic atmosphere. Not only universities should do this, but also middle schools. For example, the Zhejiang Provincial Xianghu Normal School, famous at home and abroad, under the leadership of Mr. Jin Haiguan, an educator who served as the school's president for nearly twenty years, not only enabled students in the school to legislate and abide by the law, govern themselves, cultivate virtue and practice diligence, and improve their moral character and academic performance, forming an excellent academic atmosphere. The graduates who left the school to serve were also under the supervision of the school's graduate guidance department, abiding by the school's regulations, working diligently, and serving faithfully, creating a good atmosphere. Therefore, the rule of law in schools and the democratization of education are also a way to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Freedom of thought is a major issue in current education, and it is closely related to student movements and the academic atmosphere. Regarding this issue, the author has always believed that thought cannot and should not be unified. Especially in academic institutions, everyone should be allowed to think freely and without worry, and should be given a bold environment to think absolutely freely without any scruples. It is best not to interfere with anyone's mind, nor should anyone interfere with others. Thoughts can be expressed in words, and under the conditions of not violating social order and national laws, words can be used to exchange opinions, discuss issues, or seek advice and learning from others, but it is absolutely forbidden to resort to violence. Based on this principle, students' disputes arising from thought should be respected, and the books they choose to read according to their thoughts should be allowed. However, students' disputes arising from thought must be prohibited. Those who act recklessly in and out of school according to their thoughts or misuse of their thoughts must be subject to the sanctions of school rules and national laws. In the past, universities and middle schools had a "Three Principles of the People" or "Party Ideology" course. After the implementation of the constitution, universities should change it to a "Philosophy" course, and middle schools can strengthen the teaching of "Civics" to guide students' thoughts and behaviors. Regarding the teaching of doctrines, the "Three Principles of the People" can be used as the center, and the advantages and disadvantages of all other doctrines can be discussed. Because the Three Principles of the People is a trend of thought in the modern world, and it is still a mainstream of thought occupying a large area of the world and many people. It includes many modern philosophical and political doctrines and ideas. It is not the party ideology of a party, nor is it a religious classic, but a comprehensive and inclusive doctrine of saving the country. The Three Principles of the People can be explained from an academic standpoint, thereby guiding the thoughts and behaviors of young students and cultivating an academic atmosphere of freedom of thought. Closely related to freedom of thought is the freedom of research, lecturing, speech, and publication. Universities have the freedom of research and lecturing, and people have the freedom of speech and publication. This is a principle unanimously recognized by modern democratic countries. Only by enjoying the rights of free research and free lecturing, and ensuring the freedom of speech and publication, can scholarship advance and society become civilized. Recently, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) also particularly emphasized this principle, prompting the attention of various countries. Article 11 of the "Constitution of the Republic of China" also has such an explicit provision: "The people have the freedom of speech, lecturing, writing, and publication." After the implementation of the constitution, it must be put into practice and demonstrated in facts, and this precious democratic spirit must be promoted to cultivate an academic atmosphere of free research and free lecturing to promote the democratization of education.</p>
<p>The school environment is also related to the cultivation of an excellent academic atmosphere. For example, it is not suitable to run a university in a large metropolitan area where indulgence and extravagance prevail. It is best to run a university in a place not far from a large city but with an excellent environment, beautiful scenery, quietness, and convenient transportation, such as "Fudan University" not far from Shanghai and "Wuhan University" not far from Wuchang. These are suitable places to run universities. Even secondary schools are best located in the countryside, such as the Zhejiang Provincial Xianghu Normal School mentioned earlier, which is located on the bank of Xianghu Lake and at the foot of Yanhu Mountain not far from Hangzhou. Students studying in the quiet and beautiful environment of mountains and clear waters are most likely to cultivate noble character and study profound knowledge, and are especially likely to cultivate the spirit of hard work, endurance, service, struggle, and sacrifice, as well as the virtues of diligence, thrift, honesty, sincerity, trustworthiness, and love. The habits and customs in the school will naturally be improved day by day, forming a beautiful academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Education is the most expensive undertaking and the most arduous work. Therefore, future educational funding must implement the provisions of Article 164 of the Constitution: "The funds for education, science, and culture shall not be less than 15 percent of the total budget of the central government, not less than 25 percent of the total budget of the province, and not less than 35 percent of the total budget of the city or county. The educational and cultural funds and industries established according to law shall be guaranteed." At the same time, it is also necessary to increase teachers' salaries to reach pre-war levels, increase academic research funding so that it can truly be used for academic research, and especially improve teachers' welfare and protect teachers' careers. In this way, educators can have stable lives, work with peace of mind, and patiently guide young people to improve their academic performance, cultivate virtue, and develop an excellent academic atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Exploration of Mount 積石 (Jishi): A Vast Expanse of Ice and Snow with Sparse Population; Highest Peak Does Not Exceed 19,000 Feet</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] The Central Aviation Corporation's (央航) special plane for exploring Mount 積石 (Jishi) was personally piloted by Chen Wenkuan, deputy manager of the Central Aviation Corporation, with Zheng Jiefu and Xue Yingnian serving as co-pilots and communication officers, respectively. Six Chinese reporters and eight foreign reporters accompanied the flight. Before boarding, each person was given an oxygen tank and a parachute, both instructed how to be used by Chen Xiangjiao. The plane took off at 12:55 pm, flying southwest towards Mount 積石 (Jishi). The area was characterized by undulating peaks and yellow sand, appearing desolate and bleak. At around 2:00 pm, Mount 積石 (Jishi) vaguely came into view. The mountain peaks were covered with white snow, and there were few signs of human habitation. From the aerial view, only a vast expanse of ice and snow, devoid of vegetation, was visible. The special plane, in an attempt to find Mount 積石 (Jishi)'s highest peak, circled above it for more than three hours but ultimately found nothing. According to radar measurements, the highest peak in the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area does not exceed 19,000 feet. Only Mount Geluosheng, located at the junction of Gansu, Qinghai, and Sichuan, may exceed 21,000 feet. However, since it is not within the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area and there are many mountains similar to Mount Geluosheng within the country, there is no need to conduct precise measurements. The special plane left Mount 積石 (Jishi) and turned back at around 6:00 pm. The flight altitude reached 20,400 feet yesterday. Despite having oxygen equipment, there were still some who suffered from suffocation. Fortunately, the weather was good, and the flight was smooth, so only a few experienced nausea and vomiting. However, the landing caused a moment of panic. Because the special plane had lingered in the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area for a long time in search of the highest peak, it was already dark when it returned to Lanzhou. Twilight descended, and thick fog filled the air. The Lanzhou airport also lacked night navigation equipment, causing the reporters to panic and prepare to escape. Fortunately, Chen's piloting skills were excellent, and he was experienced, and he finally landed safely at 7:40 pm, totaling six hours and forty minutes of high-altitude flight. After resting briefly upon returning to the city, they attended a dinner hosted by Zhang Zhizhong and Guo Jijiao. Zhang praised this as an excellent start and said that the world's attention to the mystery of Mount 積石 (Jishi)'s height has finally been revealed, and everyone should be satisfied, and he hoped that Chinese and American scientific circles could cooperate more closely to contribute to science. He also indicated that there should be a more concrete organization and methods to explore the mountain to seek more satisfactory gains. Subsequently, there was casual conversation, which was extremely harmonious, and they dispersed at 10:30 pm.</p>
<h3>Special Plane Arrives in Chongqing via Chengdu; Mount 積石 (Jishi) Explored Again En Route</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Seventeenth Dispatch] The Central Aviation Corporation's (央航) special plane for exploring Mount 積石 (Jishi) flew from Lanzhou to Chongqing at 8:00 am today. En route, it made a special detour to Mount 積石 (Jishi) to conduct angular measurements over the area east of Ani Maqing Township. Because thick clouds had covered that area during the exploration on the sixteenth, there was concern that it had been overlooked. Today, another high-altitude flight was made over it for two hours, confirming that all the mountain peaks were below 20,000 feet. Only one high mountain, named Gongga Mountain, was discovered along the border of Kang Province, at about 24,000 feet high, traditionally believed to be China's highest peak, but definitely not within the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area. Therefore, Chen Wenkuan solemnly announced today that he could definitively conclude that Mount 積石 (Jishi) has no peak higher than 20,000 feet. The plane arrived in Chengdu at 1:00 pm today and flew to Chongqing at 5:00 pm. It will return to Shanghai within a few days.</p>

<h3>The Eastern and Western Blocs Attach Great Importance; Italian Voters Vote Today; All Military Police Are Out to Maintain Order; Results Will Be Known in Three to Four Days</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 17th broadcast: Rome dispatch, the Italian election, which has attracted worldwide attention, will be held tomorrow, and both the Eastern and Western blocs attach great importance to it. According to one observer, the Soviet Union's political intentions have no hope of success. It is expected that in this election, the Italian Communist Party will win 35% of the total votes, and Alcide De Gasperi of the Christian Democratic Party will most likely continue to serve as Prime Minister and form a coalition government, excluding the Communist Party. However, the official results of the election will not be revealed until Wednesday. According to the European Recovery Program, the United States has promised to provide Italy with considerable economic aid, but if the Communist Party wins, this aid will be automatically canceled.</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 17th] The Italian general election will be held tomorrow. More than 300,000 armed military police are on alert overnight to ensure security during the election period, paying special attention to the squares of Milan and Rome. This election is the most important event in Europe since the beginning of the Cold War between the two major powers of the East and West. Whether Italy will remain in the ranks of Western countries or lean towards the communist countries under the influence of the Soviet Union can be determined by this election. The results of the House of Representatives election will not be revealed until Wednesday, and the results of the Senate election are expected to be revealed the next day. It is generally speculated that De Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party can get 35% of the votes, the People's Front led by the Communist Party can get 31% of the votes, and the remaining votes will be divided among other parties.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 17th] The Italian people, who will participate in the vote on the 18th to determine the future destiny of Italy, are enjoying a day of political holiday before the vote today. The election campaigns of all parties officially ended at midnight on the 16th. What political figures are currently concerned about is the weather on Sunday. If the heavy rain that started on the night of the 16th does not stop until the 18th, it will be 方利 [fānglì: beneficial] to the Communist Party. This is because supporters of the Communist Party will actively vote regardless of the weather, while many other voters may be lazy to go out due to the rain and abstain. Christian Democratic Party leader De Gasperi is unwilling to speculate on the election results, but has told party cadres that he believes he will win a majority. He has refuted such rumors, and strongly stated that they will accept the will of the people.</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 17th] Interior Minister Celba announced last night that the government will pay attention to the election at all times in the next two days. If freedom of voting is threatened, it will be dealt with severely, and even the election will be stopped.</p>
<p>[Public News Agency Rome, 17th] Emotionally strained Italian voters are hesitating on the divergent roads of the Communist Party and liberalism, not knowing which way to turn. They must elect 573 members of the House of Representatives and 237 members of the Senate who will rule Italy in the next two years. President De Gasperi ordered a three-day holiday during the election date so that workers could return to their hometown areas to vote. The order also allowed voters and candidates to enjoy a 30% discount on various travel expenses on the way back to their hometowns to vote. Railway workers said that all vehicles must be dispatched to cope with the thousands of passengers taking advantage of this unexpected five-day weekend holiday.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Return of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy; The United States, Britain, and France Send Another Note to the Soviet Union; Hoping That All Relevant Countries Can Hold Preliminary Talks</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 16th] The United States today for the third time 諦 [dì: to inspect carefully] to the Soviet Union to consider returning the free zone of Trieste to Italy. The United States also stated its willingness to consider any suggestions made by the Soviet Union on this matter. U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett has sent a memorandum to the Soviet Ambassador to the United States in response to the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the procedures recommended by Britain, the United States, and France for the return of the free zone. The U.S. memorandum pointed out the U.S. intention to hold preliminary talks with the main relevant countries, before exchanging opinions with all relevant countries. The United States originally suggested that Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France should hold this preliminary meeting in Paris in May.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 16th] The British Foreign Office has recently replied to the Soviet Union, pointing out that the Soviet Union deliberately raised procedural issues to evade the substantive issue of the proposal to return the free zone of Trieste to Italy. The British note denies the Soviet note's claim that it is undemocratic for the main relevant powers to meet to discuss this matter, and asks the Soviet Union to explain which procedure it agrees with. The British note also pointed out that the British government's suggestion to hold a preliminary meeting of the main relevant countries in Paris does not preclude any signatory to the Italian peace treaty from participating in the discussion on amending the Italian peace treaty. This preliminary meeting was originally only to inherit the procedures adopted when drafting the peace treaty. The peace treaty was first drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and then carefully reviewed by 21 countries. Therefore, the British government believes that the Soviet side's claim that convening a preliminary meeting violates democratic principles is unfounded. The British government would be happy to consider any procedural recommendations that the Soviet government can make as soon as possible to discuss the substantive issue of returning Trieste to Italy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 16th] The French Foreign Office today sent a note to the Soviet Union, asking the Soviet Union to accept the principle of returning Trieste to Italy. Its wording is roughly the same as that of the British and American notes.</p>

If either the Arab or Jewish side refuses to cease fire, the Security Council does not intend to take steps to enforce the ceasefire. The effectiveness of the ceasefire order depends on the British observation.</p>

<h3>Using Enemy and Puppet Property to Stabilize Currency Value; Starting in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region; National Bank Formally Requests Transfer from the Central Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the matter of transferring enemy and puppet property to serve as a currency stabilization fund, the National Bank is remaining silent on the matter, but is actually actively proceeding. The National Bank has formally requested the Central Trust Bureau to transfer enemy and puppet property with no property rights issues to the National Bank to serve as a fund to stabilize currency value. Those whose property rights are still in question will continue to be handled by the Central Trust Bureau. The complete measures are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The National Bank also hopes that the Central Trust Bureau will evaluate all enemy and puppet property in US dollars before the 18th of this month, but due to practical difficulties, it may not be possible to complete the evaluation as scheduled. As for the scope of enemy and puppet property to be used, in principle, it is nationwide, but the property value is highest and the handling procedures are clearest in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, so it will be carried out first in this region. According to last month's evaluation, the enemy and puppet property in this region is already over two trillion national currency.</p>
<p>According to relevant sources: Most of the enemy property that has not been sold is real estate and is already in use. In terms of its inherent value, it can strengthen the credit of legal tender, but selling it is another matter. First, there is the question of whether there are buyers. At the same time, how to relocate the occupants of the enemy property houses is also a problem. There are even more problems with reverse property, because after a general amnesty in the future, some traitorous owners will regain their freedom, and property right disputes may arise with their confiscated property.</p>

<h3>"Flying General" Divorce Case Opens; Presiding Judge Urges Reconciliation; Du Qin States She Would Rather Die Than Return to the Wang Family</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The divorce case of "Flying General" Wang Zhuo and his wife Du Qin, in which Wang accused Du of adultery with Tan Yuehan and disrupting the family, was previously prosecuted by the District Procuratorate. The court held its first hearing yesterday morning. After Judge Zhong Xianda took his seat in the Second Criminal Court, the plaintiff, Wang Zhuo, 35 years old, from Chongming, stated that he married Du Qin in 1935 while serving as a flight instructor at the Jianqiao Aviation School in Hangzhou. The following year, they had a daughter, who is now 13 years old. In 1936, during the Guangdong Incident, he was stationed at Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou, and Du also went with him. In 1937, when the August 13th Shanghai War broke out, he served as the squadron leader of the 24th Pursuit Squadron of the Air Force. On October 6th, he was wounded in the air battle to defend the capital. Later, he was transferred to the Kunming Air Force Officer School as a senior pursuit instructor, concurrently serving as the commander of the Provisional Pursuit Squadron. In July 1939, while test-flying a Russian-style fighter plane, a mechanical failure caused the plane to crash, resulting in serious injuries. Although he received treatment, he lost sight in one eye,</p>
<p>lost sight in one eye and hearing in one ear, and suffered from nervous disorders. In February 1940, the government sent him to Hong Kong for treatment. In the autumn of the same year, due to the threat of enemy planes in Hong Kong, he was introduced by a friend to Tan Yuehan, an employee of the Central Wireless Radio Guilin Factory, and they evacuated to Shaoguan together on a small boat. Sharing the same boat day and night, Tan and Du gradually fell in love. Moreover, Tan was young and handsome, good at being gentle and considerate to women, and had no wife. Du gradually transferred her love to Tan, and when they parted in Shaoguan, Du even</p>
<p>covered her face and wept bitterly. In September 1940, upon arriving in Kunming, Du, having secretly agreed on the boat to use wireless military communication to exchange messages, ran away on December 18, 1940, and hired two lawyers, Zhu Shinan and Wang Zhenya, to publish a divorce notice in the newspaper. Later, after the persuasion of Wang Shuming, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, she returned home on January 10, 1941. By the winter of 1944, Du's passion for Tan was so intense that she took the opportunity to fly to Chongqing privately. At this time, Tan was working at the US Army News Office radio station. Wang discovered this and flew to Chongqing to find her and brought her back to Kunming again. However, the relationship between the couple had already broken down.</p>
<p>had already broken down. After the victory at the end of 1945, he led his family back to Shanghai. At this time, Tan had been waiting at the Xiang Sheng Hotel. Du ran away for the third time and published a statement in the newspaper declaring that she had separated from Wang, and secretly went to Tianjin to live with Tan. Du changed her name to Tan Daishan, also known as Tan Lixiu. Later, Tan was sent to the United States by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. On New Year's Day in 1948, Wang discovered that Du was living at A4, Fengye Building, Yingkou Road, Tianjin, and went to find her, bringing Du back home for the third time. In order to seek a permanent solution, he accused Tan of disrupting the family</p>
<p>disrupting the family, and because Du Qin defended Tan Yuehan, he also added Du as the second defendant. When Du Qin, who was in custody, was interrogated, Du, wearing an old blue cloth cheongsam, looking thin and haggard, stated: "On December 25, 1940, in Kunming, because of Wang's abuse, we had an agreement to divorce. After General Wang Shuming's mediation, we reconciled and tried to live together. At that time, Wang Zhuo personally wrote a note guaranteeing that he would not abuse me again in the future. However, Wang Zhuo later managed to destroy the note and became even more severe. He wouldn't allow me to eat during the day or sleep at night. He wouldn't allow me to cry or laugh, leaving me at a loss.</p>
<p>at a loss, and he even forced me to commit suicide with guns and knives. There were also various perverted behaviors, treating me worse than a prostitute, which I am unwilling to discuss further because it would be indecent." At this point, she burst into tears, weeping uncontrollably. Judge Zhong immediately advised her to return to her husband's home and attempt reconciliation. Du stated that she would rather die than return to the Wang family. Then, lawyer Chen Ziyu defended the defendant. At the end of the hearing, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for further review. Wang was dismissed, and Du was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Sakhalin Returnee Representatives Voice Concerns to Social Affairs Bureau: Have Relatives and Friends in Taiwan; No Need for Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, four representatives of Sakhalin returnees, Lu Changbang, Wang Shenzhai, Gao Fanglong, and Zheng Shouchuan, visited Yuan Wenzhang, the fourth director of the Social Affairs Bureau. According to their statements, they had lived in Japan for many years, were able to understand Japanese fluently, and were well-adapted to the lifestyle. Therefore, seeking a living in Taiwan was most suitable for them. Moreover, they all had familiar relatives and friends in Taiwan. The previous refusal of the province to allow them to reside there was due to a misunderstanding that they were refugees in need of assistance. In reality, the returnees all had the ability to support themselves and did not need assistance from the local authorities. Director Yuan immediately stated that if the returnees had existing relatives and friends in Taiwan and did not need relief, the Social Affairs Bureau would consult with the Civil Affairs Bureau to include all the returnees in the city's Baojia system, issue identity cards, and then allow them to go to Taiwan as citizens. However, the claim that they all had relatives and friends in Taiwan would be investigated first. More than a thousand refugees from Qingdao and Lianyungang in northern Jiangsu arrived in Shanghai by ship yesterday and are temporarily residing in the factory of the China Textile Company on Yangshupu Road. The municipal authorities have sent a special telegram to the governments of both places, stating that if refugees are sent to Shanghai, they should be notified in advance, and that the city is already overcrowded with refugees and has no way to accommodate them.</p>

<h3>Case of Trafficking Arms and Drugs Cracked on Shanghai-Hangzhou Express Train; Three Criminals Escorted to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 6:30 AM on the 14th of this month, as train No. 24 from Hangzhou to Shanghai was leaving the station, a young man suddenly threw a handbag he was carrying between the tracks and then quickly jumped onto the train. The railway police at Hangzhou Station inspected the abandoned luggage bag and were shocked to find a No. 3 rifle and 970 rounds of ammunition. They immediately notified the stationmaster to urgently stop the train and sent police to search the entire train. They could not find the young man, but they discovered that a military officer and two passengers in the first-class carriage looked panicked. Upon inspecting their luggage, they found two catties and twelve taels of opium and a revolver with dozens of rounds of ammunition. When the train arrived in Changan, the three criminals were escorted off the train and transferred to Hangzhou for strict interrogation. According to the military officer, his name was Xu Yongwei, 27 years old, from Guangdong, and he was a captain quartermaster in the communications battalion of a certain reorganized division of the army. He had requested leave to return to his hometown in Guangdong on the 17th of last month. On the way, he met an old colleague, Hu Shaoqi, and together they purchased fifteen revolvers and 1,000 rounds of ammunition in Guangdong for 25 million yuan. On the way through the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, they also purchased more than two catties of opium, intending to bring it to Shanghai for sale and profit. Hu Shaoqi had already escaped at Hangzhou Station when the incident occurred, and the whereabouts of the remaining fifteen revolvers are unknown. The other two suspects, Luo Jianfu and Qiu Lianggui, are friends of the fugitive ringleader Hu Shaoqi. The police department has issued strict orders to investigate. When train No. 24 arrived in Shanghai, a yellow small leather suitcase was found unclaimed in the first-class carriage. Upon opening it, it contained fifteen revolvers. The criminals were escorted to Shanghai yesterday.

<h3>Yang Anren and Zhan Lianniu; Reasons for Remand for Retrial Announced</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The two protagonists of the Gold Rush case, Yang Anren and Zhan Yunsheng, after being sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court and approved for execution by the High Court after review, the defendants applied to the District Court for retrial, which was rejected. They then presented new evidence to appeal to the High Court. The High Court ruled: "The original ruling is revoked and remanded for retrial for further ruling." The contents of the High Court's ruling are excerpted as follows: (1) Regarding Yang Anren's part, the appellant appealed, stating that the start and end times of the gold allocation on February 8 of last year, as well as the delivery at that time, were all carried out under the order of former President Bei, as evidenced by a copy of a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Bank. This important evidence was overlooked during the original trial and review. (2) Regarding Zhan Yunsheng's part, the appellant's appeal stated that both trials adopted Ni Zuguang's statements, which were unfavorable to the appellant, and ignored Lin Fengbao's testimony, which was favorable to the appellant, and did not clarify the reasons for the adoption or rejection. Furthermore, the request for investigation of the list of names of all gold purchasing customers on February 8, which was important evidence favorable to the appellant, was not investigated. It is difficult to convince the appellant.</p>

<h3>Import Quotas for Export Raw Materials; Export Control Commission Sets Separate Regulations</h3>
<p>After the regulations for the inspection of raw materials for export products were approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the Export Control Commission immediately drafted supplementary articles in accordance with the original regulations and submitted them for implementation. Export manufacturers began applying to import the raw materials needed to manufacture products last month. As of the present, the association has received more than 180 applications, and more than 120 have been approved successively. In order to facilitate control, the association has strictly regulated the types and amounts of raw materials needed for import by manufacturers in various industries, and has formulated two types of statistical lists, A and B, for reference. Type A is for industries such as thermos bottles, and Type B is for industries such as enamelware. The raw materials imported under Type A must be exported, and the import amount must not exceed 45% of the export amount. For raw materials imported under Type B, a portion can be supplied to the domestic market. The import amount can exceed 45% of the export amount. Detailed regulations are said to be officially announced by the association next week.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Barter Issue Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is learned that Sino-Japanese barter trade is currently in a state of intermittent negotiation. The main reason is the instability within our country, with no goods available for export. Regarding the quantity of salt to be exported to Japan this year, no decision has yet been made. It is said that the core of the problem does not lie in the supply and demand of our country's salt, but in the price of salt exported to Japan. As for the export of Taiwanese sugar to Japan, it is a cash transaction. The first batch has already been traded, and the second batch is still under negotiation. Japan considers the price of US$200 per ton to be too high, while our side believes it is not enough to cover costs, so a new price must be negotiated. It is still in the negotiation stage.</p>

<h3>High-End Market Lacks Sustained Momentum, Chinese Stocks Remain in a Consolidation Phase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, buying interest in Chinese stocks gradually emerged, and some securities firms had already started to take action, resulting in a positive consolidation trend. However, stimulation from foreign stocks still made it difficult for the buying momentum to continue for a long time. The high-end market lacked sustained momentum, and the market remained in a consolidation phase at the close. At the start of the morning, sentiment was weak. Yong Yarn opened low at 17915 yuan. As the prices of treasury bonds and foreign exchange rates did not change, there was inevitable disappointment, initially selling down to 1790 yuan, then advancing to 1860 yuan. Agency fees opened high to 18 yuan and 21 yuan, falling back to 1830 yuan. Seeing the strong stimulation from foreign stocks, Hong Kong Electric also reported a reduction.

However, the fluctuations were not significant, and the market showed a consolidating trend. In the southern market, sellers initially tried to maintain the original price, but eventually struggled to sustain it due to sluggish sales. Japonica rice and early Bo rice both fell by 50,000 yuan. However, Indica rice and Baiyuan rice remained stable due to limited supply. The northern market also saw little change, with Japonica and early rice rising by 50,000 yuan. Premium Japonica rice neared the 4 million mark. Total arrivals at the north and south markets amounted to 4,397 shi.</p>

The market was flooded with goods, making it difficult to rebound, and eventually weakening again. Bingchuan Flour opened and closed at 1,395,000 yuan, while Lao Che Flour closed at 1,390,000 yuan, each falling by 10,000 yuan. Bran was targeted by merchants from other regions. Large-package bran rose by 15,000 yuan. Wheat remained at the original price of 2,050,000 yuan. Coarse Grains</p>
<p>Coarse Grains: Most grains rose in price, especially raw peanuts, as rumors spread that the Central Trust Bureau was searching for and purchasing them in the production areas for export. Sellers seized the opportunity and refused to release their goods, pushing the price up by a significant 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Transactions of soybeans were limited on both sides, and the market remained stable.

Sales of recycled goods were increasingly scarce. With stronger demand on the street, the price rose by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cake also followed, rising by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Wenzhou yellow tea, which is usually sold to Tianjin, Yingkou, and other places, initially had a decent market this year due to the scarcity of new goods. However, it has recently been reported that tea sales in those areas have slowed down, inevitably discouraging sentiment, and prices have fallen sharply. Similarly, new Longjing teas, which have been arriving continuously in recent days and are increasingly of poor quality, have also been declining in price. However, new Wenzhou mao hong tea, which has been strongly absorbed in the Wuxi and Changzhou areas, has achieved remarkable results in the market, setting it apart from others. Domestic sales of old tea remain as strong as before.</p>
<p>Western-style Tea Market: Exporters are still making up for shortages of Pingshui pearl tea, but the supply is mediocre, resulting in a daily turnover similar to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Discrepancy Between Official and Black Market Rates Makes Tung Oil Procurement Difficult</h3>

<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>Meddling Parents Arrange Marriage, Childhood Sweethearts in Love</h3>
<p>Lu Kunshan writes: I am a humble reader of your esteemed newspaper and have a matter to trouble you with. Last year, in the spring (when I was seventeen), I was introduced by a relative to study in Shanghai. Two months later, I received a letter from home saying that they had arranged a marriage for me. At the time, I was forced to come to Shanghai and did not yet have a proper job, so to avoid gossip, I did not refuse, although I was unwilling in my heart. Recently, I received another letter from home, preparing to hold the wedding tomorrow. However, I have long had a lover. We have been like siblings since childhood, but I never mentioned her to my parents. I now have several legal questions and would be grateful if you could answer them in "Social Services": (1) Is a marriage arranged by parents before I am of age, without my consent, valid? (2) If the other party refuses to dissolve the engagement, how can I deal with it? (3) After the engagement is dissolved, can I choose my own spouse and get married?</p>
<p>[Reply from American Lawyer Fan] (1) A marriage arranged by parents for a minor, without the minor's consent, is legally valid. (2) If the other party refuses to dissolve the engagement, you can refuse to marry. (3) After the engagement is dissolved, you can freely choose your spouse after reaching adulthood; otherwise, you should still obtain your parents' consent to be legal.</p>
<p>Telegram Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Answered by Shanghai Telegraph Bureau</h3>
<p>(Question from traveler Lin Yifei) I frequently travel between Shanghai and Fuzhou for business. Because I do not have a representative office in Shanghai, I must personally come to your bureau's main business office to send telegrams, which is quite inconvenient. I propose that agency offices be established at important wharves to facilitate merchants and travelers.</p>
<p>(Answer) The Bureau has long been planning to establish agency offices at various wharves. We have now reached an agreement with the China Merchants Bureau to pilot business offices at the first, second, and third wharves to receive telegrams. You can send telegrams nearby, and we hope you will offer your valuable opinions to facilitate improvement.</p>
<p>(Question from Gonghexing, Jinling East Road) It is difficult to obtain discarded newspapers. Please remedy and improve this.</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the distribution of discarded newspapers, the Bureau has conducted a detailed survey. There is a great difference between the number of newspapers issued and the number received daily. Therefore, two discarded newspaper boxes have been set up in the main business office, with 4,000 discarded newspapers provided daily for users to take at any time. However, each time they are placed, all of them are taken by one user within a few minutes, defeating the purpose of the Bureau's box. Recently, to reduce the burden, whole discarded newspapers are charged 50,000 yuan per volume to cover costs, while single sheets are still provided free of charge.</p>

<h3>Spring Scenery of West Lake</h3>
<p>Lingyin is breezy, Leifeng is warm, this tranquil landscape is calling to all!</p>
<p>People weary of the hustle and bustle of the city have returned, batch after batch. They praise the gentle tranquility of the lake, they also admire the new green of the embankment willows, paying respects to Yue Wu Mu, mourning Su Xiaoxiao; among the peaks and valleys, beside the streams and springs, a moment of gazing offers delight? Or comfort? Eternal longing? Or tenderness in the heart? No one can express the temptation that spring's West Lake holds in their hearts!</p>
<p>By the lake, the misty dawn, the lights in the depths of the willow forest, the vast sky, the long and silent shadow of the pagoda, have entrusted the memories of many tourists! Nature has endowed West Lake with too profound a charm, especially in the third month of late spring!</p>
<p>Lingering! May the beauty of West Lake always follow your memories! This is a precious memory! (Photo by our reporter Yu Chuang)</p>

<h3>Small City</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Although I live in a big city, I always yearn for a small city. Perhaps this is in line with the so-called "petty bourgeoisie"? Even I can't explain it.</p>
<p>I really admire those giant merchants and great entrepreneurs who strategize within their tents. Their minds are calculating on gold notes all day long without fatigue. This is indeed a kind of cultivation. If you talk about patience, this can also be considered one of them. Recently, I saw a cartoon in a certain square publication depicting businessmen with large bellies and small brains, and writers with large heads and shrunken bellies. In fact, this is not right. Businessmen can be said to have the most developed brains, while writers are the ones without brains. We imitate a sentence from Mencius, "Did Yao and Shun not use their minds? They just didn't use them for farming!" "Do writers not use their minds? They just don't use them for money." But not using it for money is the same as not using the mind, because without money there is nothing! Rushing around in the big city, you can't get out of these forces' clutches. You don't have to walk on the sidewalk of a main road to be in danger of being run over by a big truck. Even if you sit behind closed doors, you can still be run over. Even if your body isn't run over, your spirit, sweat, and blood are always being exploited.</p>
<p>Tao Pengze's poem: "Mistakenly entered the dust net, thirty years have passed, for a long time in a cage, I can finally return to nature," this meaning is expressed very vividly. However, we do not have that thatched cottage in the mountains where we can look at the clouds and the sea, or watch the flying birds, mainly because the dust net we have entered is not deep enough, and we have not been able to rise from five pecks of rice to two thousand bushels to rent a villa in a scenic area. Therefore, Mr. Five Willows is still extremely extravagant in our eyes. Even if we are all petty bourgeois, he is still an outstanding one. With such a house with five willow trees in front of the door, mulberry and elm trees behind the house, peaches and plums in front of the house, dogs barking and geese honking, why bother with five pecks of rice? What's more, there are fifty acres of land for growing sorghum, where we can eat and drink old wine to our heart's content?</p>
<p>Consciously bourgeois, but in reality proletarian in terms of property, this year is truly rotten to the core. It's difficult to be a person either way, so I can only feel that it's good to escape from the sinful metropolis. If there really is a Shangri-La, I'm afraid that many more than just me would be "glad to go back!" Even those who criticize me may not be unmoved.</p>
<p>People are all somewhat self-inflated, but the big city only gives us oppression. Not only are the portly tycoons everyone's King Yama, but even the ten-story-plus high-rises that obscure the sky are a threat to us. Walking on Nanjing Road or Avenue Joffre, I often feel like I can't breathe. If the Bund didn't face the river, its sense of coercion on people would probably be even greater. In small cities, there are no such strange things. We can scoff at that kind of pseudo-Western-style building made of mud walls, as if it doesn't exist. The old-fashioned flat houses and ancient pavilions are so approachable and grand that we only feel broad and intimate living inside. Everything has a general warmth, even though the clapboards are not airtight with cement. Walking on the street, you can be uninhibited without having to look around. You always have two decent clothes. Wearing them can make the owner of the foreign goods store respect you. If it's a place that sells books and newspapers, they will talk to you, saying that you are from Shanghai or Nanjing, and you must have brought them some news, right? It would be even better if there was a market where the vegetables of the villagers and the floral foreign cloth and cheap cosmetics of the city people are exchanged. Zhang Zongzi, in "Xi Hu Xiang Shi" (West Lake Incense Market), wrote: "Gentlemen and ladies are no match for the rustic attire of village women; cauldrons and strange things are no match for the popularity of clay figures and bamboo horses," which quite captures a kind of earthy prosperity. Moreover, there are simply no pretentious elegant women or useless antique books and paintings in the countryside. It is those healthy and simple human relationships that give us some enlightenment and lessons. If there is still culture in China, it must be here, and not in dance halls and concert halls. This is a bit of national vitality—the little bit of vitality that has been sucked dry by the big city. Haven't you seen scholars advocating the return to the homeland theory? I can't say what theory it is, I just instinctively feel that small cities are better than big cities. What do you think?</p>
<h3>Fallen Flowers</h3>
<p>— Ping Gong</p>
<p>I heard the sound of rain pattering on my pillow. I pushed open the paper window to see that the cherry blossoms in the courtyard had fallen almost completely, the fallen petals colorful like a carpet, and I remembered Yan Yuanxian's line, "But what can be done about the flowers falling?" According to Ouyang Xiu's "Gui Tian Lu": "Yan Yuanxian was famous for his writing. In his youth, he lived in wealth and honor, and his nature was bold and outstanding. Wherever he went, he extended hospitality to guests. Many famous scholars of the time came from his door. He was dismissed from the position of Vice Privy Councilor and became the Resident of Nanjing at the age of thirty-eight. Wang Qi and Zhang Kang were his most honored guests." Zhu Qi (Junyu) was known to Yuanxian because of the couplet "It seems like an old friend, the swallow returns." When Yuanxian was thirty-eight years old, it was the sixth year of the Tiansheng reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, 1028 AD. Comparing it to Western history, it was thirty-eight years before the Norman Conquest of England (1066). At this time, did British writers have such beautiful prose as Yuanxian?</p>
<p>The works of the 17th-century English Metaphysical poets seem obscure, but when savored carefully, they feel lingering and profound. Besides Donne, Herrick is also not bad. Herrick's poem "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time" ("Gather ye rose-buds...") and "Pluck the flower when it is in bloom..." have similar artistic conceptions, but are still many years behind.</p>
<p>Donne's poems are just like our country's ci poetry, using few strokes but unraveling silk from cocoons, leaving endless aftertaste. Donne is good at speaking of love, good at taking metaphors, and values imagery, all of which are similar to our country's ci poetry. However, our country's monks never so greatly violate the precept of flowery language, while Donne was indeed a monk.</p>
<p>This also made me think of people outside the world having affairs. I extremely love the beauty of the words in the "Thinking of the World" section of "Nie Hai Ji" (Record of Karmic Sea), writing about the little nun who can't bear the loneliness of the green lamp, her mind wandering like a wild horse, and then she feels that even the angry-eyed Vajra has amorous feelings, this emptiness is reality. However, "Going Down the Mountain" is vulgar and unbearable, and the writing is completely different from "Thinking of the World." I don't know why. As for Western literature about people outside the world having affairs, Browning's "Fra Lippo Lippi" is the best. Fra Lippo Lippi was indeed a real person, famous for his paintings, and Browning, hundreds of years later, used delicate and unrestrained strokes to uniquely write about a section where he was caught having an affair, which is not only excellent in style but also rich in musical beauty.</p>
<p>When I was in Kunming, I often went boating on Dianchi Lake with Professor Yan Bu Ye. One day, Professor Yan and I were both slightly drunk, and we argued greatly in the boat about the merits of Browning and Milton. Professor Yan, a famous poet in contemporary England, likes to drink, is unkempt, and reads extremely widely, never forgetting what he has read. That day, he recited more than a hundred lines of Milton's "Paradise Lost" in Dianchi Lake to show the excellence of Milton, because at that time I had just praised Browning for being affectionate and considered Milton to be stagnant. However, Professor Yan was indeed a very interesting person. If I praised Milton's beauty and belittled Browning, he would definitely bring out a large section of Browning to show off. Afterwards, I wrote a long article, still praising Browning and suppressing Milton as before, to present to Professor Yan, and he actually gave it a mistaken compliment. I heard from Mr. Hu Shi that Professor Yan has married and has returned to Peking University to teach. Today I saw in the newspaper that this great professor has resigned. Professor Yan can take a break to drink a few days, the old Beijing baijiu is not expensive and the quality is very good.</p>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>— Shuo Fu</p>
<p>Those who cook probably don't write articles, and those who write articles may not need to cook themselves. Therefore, I have a special feeling in my heart for writing this short essay. It can be said to be an ordinary and quite accidental little thing.</p>
<p>I remember that I only started learning to cook when I was twenty-nine years old. At that time, Mr. Chen and I lived together in a dormitory attached to a certain company. Downstairs was a certain kitchen, which was very convenient for ordering food, but it only provided dishes and no rice. At first, we always sent the tea boy to buy "white rice" at a certain Cantonese restaurant across the road. Later, the tea boy took leave to go back, and later his odd jobs were busier than before, so he couldn't spare the time. Mr. Chen and I bought a stove and a rice cooker together, and naturally we also bought some rice, and so we tried to cook rice ourselves.</p>
<p>The initial results were not good. Either it was not cooked, or it was because we were too impatient and kept opening the pot to look, the steam escaped, and as a result, the rice was burnt.</p>
<p>The amount of water added to the rice also has a certain dimension. If too much is added, it will naturally be too soft to be palatable. If too little is added, it will inevitably be too hard to swallow after cooking. Here is a trick: add water about the depth of the first joint of your index finger above the rice, and it will cook to a moderate softness.</p>
<p>In addition, it can be mentioned that the amount of rice placed in the pot is also a small problem. Usually, it is appropriate to fill about half the pot, because rice expands. If it is filled too full, after cooking, it will expand from the pot to the outside, and the pot itself will not be able to hold it. I once saw in a Hollywood comedy a certain female protagonist cooking rice on a gas stove. Presumably, too much rice was added. After cooking, it continued to pour out of the pot, making a mess all over the floor. If something like this really happened, it would naturally be very bad and also very embarrassing.</p>
<p>Recently, I no longer need to cook for myself. However, I am very fond of the health motto of often doing small chores. Occasionally, when I'm in the mood, I quite enjoy cooking as a pastime. Before I knew how to cook, it seemed like a difficult task. After cooking it once or twice, I felt that it was a very simple job. I think people in the city, after being tired of playing cards, dancing, and watching plays, can try cooking, which is also an interesting little experience. Bachelors can save a lot of expenses going to restaurants, which is not a bad extra benefit.</p>
<h3>Sea Red Mansion Poetry Record</h3>
<p>— Xu Banmeng</p>
<p>Tooth Loose Chant</p>
<p>Lips broken still able to speak, teeth shaking cannot rely on strength, since coming across the sea, two teeth have fallen in five years. I have long known that the rigid must break, and that old age is approaching, not asking for the fine or the coarse, regardless of the sweet or the savory. It is like repaying a debt, one rising up after another. White rice fills my hungry belly, gold turns into遺矢 [missed arrow, waste]. Three meals three times to repay, connected to death. I think of the rich and powerful, indulging in extreme extravagance. The rich set up a banquet, enough for three months of bran. The smell of wine and meat comes from the vermillion gates, frozen bones fill the cold market. It is not that Heaven is unkind, nor that people are not ashamed, encountering karmic results, suffering and joy begin. My hair is just starting to turn gray, and my teeth are also decaying. I will let them fall out naturally, and not worry about moving or staying still. On a sunny spring day, the sun shines on me, as I chew and lick slowly.</p>
<p>Famous General</p>
<p>The great desert of Tianshan shook with heroic plans, the dazzling light of the sword shone on red skin, the mournful wind blew iron cavalry for thousands of miles, and the heavy snow pressed down on the flying fox at the third watch. The shadow of the tooth banner was dense with ice patterns, the treasure tent lights were dim, and courage was rough. Now that there is a famous general like Piao Yao, he will not let the brave Huns run through the customs.</p>
<h3>The Strangest Hotel in the World</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>The strangest hotel in the world is in the "Three No Management Zone" of Tianjin. In the north, unlike the south where people can sleep outdoors on winter nights without necessarily freezing to death, a type of hotel has emerged to protect people's lives, which is a 100% "hotel" dedicated to accommodation, and cannot be used during the day. Its facilities consist of a dilapidated large house with dozens of holes dug along the base of the walls, each capable of holding one person. When a traveler comes to stay, they invert their body into the hole, only exposing their head. A handyman stands nearby holding a shovel, waiting. Once the guest has entered the hole, they immediately shovel a shovel of sand to cover the guest's neck. It turns out that the basement level is cool in summer and warm in winter. In the basements of the north—of course, not stone but soil—you can not light the stove in winter without feeling cold. In this way, everything below the head is sealed in the hole, so at least you won't freeze to death. Humans are truly elastic animals. No matter how impoverished they are, they will think of a way. It is still impossible to sleep in North China with blankets and without lighting a fire for warmth. Therefore, there are old women who collect coal kernels, which shows that even if they have no way to buy coal, they cannot help but search for fuel in the garbage that people have dumped, even though it is as difficult as panning for gold.</p>
<p>In this way, everything can be saved. Beggars and coolies without beds, stoves, or bedding can still sleep soundly for one night. The fee per person, ten years ago, was one large copper coin, about a little less than one silver dollar.</p>
<h3>Free Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14 - Freedom at Sea (129)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai saw Xiao Bai's speech, which was too biased, and wanted to refute him, but because he was an elder, he did not dare to say it, and only repeatedly responded: "Yes! Yes! In a few days, I will go to my uncle's residence to see Qi Wan's letter." Xiao Bai said: "That's great, you should come to my house often in the future, and I will tell you about some operas. Just now I heard you sing that section of Yu Tang Chun, your voice is still very sweet and smooth, but your enunciation is still incorrect. I have time to slowly point you out. When Qi Wan comes back one day, she will be very happy to see your singing skills have improved." After Xiao Bai finished speaking, he laughed loudly. Zhu Zhai was made to laugh and cry by him. Xiao Bai then invited him to Laijin Yuxuan to drink tea. Zhu Zhai had no choice but to accompany him. He recalled when he first met Qi Wan, he was also drinking tea at Laijin Yuxuan. Today he came with Xiao Bai, but his beloved was thousands of miles away. Although he was perfunctory with Xiao Bai, he was very melancholy in his heart. Xiao Bai drank black tea and ate some snacks before leaving the garden with Zhu Zhai. Zhu Zhai watched Xiao Bai get in the car and leave, and he walked slowly along the side of the road, only thinking about Qi Wan. He took the letter that Xiao Bai gave him out of his pocket again and looked at it while walking, feeling only sad in his heart, feeling that Qi Wan was too wronged and too affectionate. She completely sacrificed for me. Xiao Bai misunderstood her psychology, which was too unreasonable. He didn't know what his old father would think after reading this letter. Even if the old man could express sympathy and understand her, what good would it do her? She said that she had no face to return to Beiping and see her colleagues again. How sad were these words? She also said that she hoped that her old father could permanently hide it from me and not let me know her hidden secrets, so as to avoid my suffering. How considerate and meticulous was her intention? She set up a night when people were quiet, and a hundred emotions gathered, and her tears wet her pillow. How tragic was this? Qi Wan, I really harmed you, I made you suffer, my conscience is going to pass, Zhu Zhai was holding the letter, reading while walking, his whole mind focused on the letter. Unexpectedly, just after passing the Sanzuomen, a large truck carrying many soldiers, speeding diagonally from the Public Security Street, rushed over suddenly. By the time the horn sounded, Zhu Zhai wanted to avoid it, but it was too late. The car rushed over and knocked him to the ground.</p>
<h3>The Price of a Spit</h3>
<p>— Jing Ming</p>
<p>A friend who has just returned from Hong Kong told us that there, they are strictly enforcing the campaign to prohibit spitting in public. Anyone who is found to violate this rule (prohibition of spitting in public) in a public place or street will be taken to the police station and fined 100 Hong Kong dollars. This fine is considerable in any currency, especially when calculated in our Chinese legal tender. He said, that is why Hong Kong can effectively achieve not spitting in public.</p>
<p>From the most stringent places in the world dealing with spitting, we believe that Brooklyn, New York should be the most prominent. Over there, there are conspicuous notices posted at the entrance of every public bus. Anyone who is found to violate this rule (prohibition of spitting in public) on a public bus is legally liable to a fine of US$500, or one year in prison, or even both.</p>
<p>However, looking back at our Shanghai, the campaign to prohibit spitting in public has long been widespread, but in the end, we only hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but we don't see anyone coming down! (Translated from the Continental Daily)</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Only in fierce and violent winds do we know which ships on the ocean are swaying? Which ones are about to sink? Which ones can sail steadily?…</p>
<p>A rose blooming in a warm room is unfortunate, because it has failed its beautiful thorns.</p>
<p>Water hyacinths on the water, gathering and scattering, will still gather after scattering, it's just a matter of time.</p>
<p>But if it leaves the water, then everything is over.</p>
<h3>Thunderstorm Skills Gathering</h3>
<p>Upon seeing the news that Jinshan Temple had been reduced to ashes in a great fire, I was deeply shocked. This famous scenic spot and temple complex, also a palace of art, has also suffered such a calamity? The pen of history should record in bold letters: "On April 6th, in the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, the Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang was destroyed by fire." This method of recording in historical texts the destruction of great architecture signifies more than just the damage to the object itself; it is truly a representation of the "heavenly warning to humanity." It is even more significant than the collapse of the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou more than twenty years ago.</p>
<p>"Jin and Jiao stand eternally amidst the currents," "Jinshan appears as small as a fist"; the reason for its popularity is largely due to the "Jinshan Temple." Jinshan Temple also features the story of the monk Fahai, Xu Xuan, and the White Snake, a strange and beautiful tale of "love between immortals and mortals." Evolving from the West Lake to the Yangtze River, from mythology to drama, it even became the final commemorative performance co-starring Mei Lanfang and Li Shifang (Li encountered tragedy returning north to Qingdao after playing Xiaoqing in "Jinshan Temple" in Shanghai). This too is a page in the temple's mournful history.</p>
<p>The ancient relics of Jinshan Temple, such as Zhuge Liang's marching drum, Su Dongpo's jade belt, and Wen Zhengming's hand-scroll masterpieces, are all unharmed, which is a fortunate event amidst misfortune.</p>
<p>It is also heard that Abbot Taicang has vowed to rebuild the temple and restore it to its former glory in due time. Coincidentally, I read in the collected works of Yu Yue, the Elder of Quyuan, about famous temples in Suzhou and Hangzhou that were destroyed by the fires of the Taiping Rebellion. One was completely restored, while the other never regained its former appearance. The record of Baoji Temple in Suzhou states: The temple was built east of Huangtu Bridge in the prefectural city during the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty. During the Daoguang reign, Abbot Hengfeng renovated it, and although the framework was established, great disturbances repeatedly occurred, and the bright walls and red pillars were transformed into a desolate ruin. At the beginning of the Tongzhi reign, the three Wu regions were pacified, and Hengfeng, mindful of the sacred temple, carried out restorations, fulfilling his initial vow. The three gates stood towering, the main hall was vast and magnificent, and the bodhisattvas, arhats, and devas displayed various colors and forms. Success was achieved through perseverance. The rise and fall of a place truly depends on the people. The record of Jingci Temple in Hangzhou states: It was founded during the Wu-Yue period and renamed during the Shaoxing reign of the Song Dynasty, becoming the leading temple in the West Lake area. During the Xianfeng reign, it was destroyed by fire and became overgrown with weeds. During the Tongzhi reign, the monk Dayuan planned to restore it but ultimately failed. Later, Xuezhou moved from Shengyin Temple to preside over Jingci, building houses according to the terrain, high and low, creating a picturesque scene, but he ultimately failed to fully restore its former appearance. Thus, the rebuilding of famous temples can be successful or unsuccessful, swift or delayed. It depends on human effort. Abbot, take heart!</p>
<p>Legend has it that Emperor Ming and an old monk were together at Jinshan, overlooking the passing ships like shuttles, and the masts of the boats moored at the foot of the mountain like a forest, admiring the boundless magnificent scenery. The monk said that there were only two boats, one for "fame" and one for "profit," which truly encompasses everything and awakens many people. It is also said that when Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty made a southern tour to this place, he wanted to inscribe an imperial stele. After much deliberation with his accompanying literary officials, he came up with the four characters "Jiang Tian Yi Lan" (River and Sky, One View), which indeed exuded an imposing atmosphere. It was derived from the Tengwang Pavilion Preface, "Autumn waters share one color with the long sky," which can be said to be transforming the ancient into something new. According to reports, the Great Hero Hall and the Arhat Hall, with many sixteen-foot-tall golden statues and carved beams and painted pillars, were all consumed by the fire, but only the pagoda and the Fahai Cave were spared. It is unknown what fate awaits this stele pavilion. Furthermore, the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, compiled in the early Qing Dynasty, was stored in seven pavilions: "Wenyuan," "Wensu," "Wenjin," "Wenyuan," "Wenhui," "Wenzong," and "Wenlan." Among them, the "Wenzong Pavilion" was located in Jinshan Temple, containing a total of 36,000 volumes, all in palace-style bindings, filling the buildings and extremely spectacular, but it has long been forgotten.</p>

<h3>Suggestions to the National Assembly Regarding Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>— Ding Jiwan</p>
<p>We, who have participated in the National Assembly, deeply understand the heavy responsibility regarding the rise and fall of Chinese medicine. We hereby propose four points for improving Chinese medicine to inform our fellow practitioners who are concerned.</p>
<p>1. Increase the authority of the Chinese Medicine Committee of the Ministry of Health, authorizing the committee to convene public associations of Chinese medicine practitioners from various provinces and cities at any time to decide on important medical and pharmaceutical administration and reform matters.</p>
<p>2. Based on the Chinese medicine specialty school curriculum promulgated by the ministry, establish national Chinese medicine specialty schools and subsidize excellent private Chinese medicine specialty schools to promote Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>3. Establish a national Chinese medicine research institute to collect effective medicines and formulas, refine and extract their essence, and develop the special effects of Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>4. Local health authorities should liaise with local public associations of Chinese medicine practitioners to establish public Chinese medicine hospitals and encourage the establishment of private Chinese medicine hospitals. Shen Zhongli</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Headaches and Dizziness in Women and Anemia and Uterine Diseases</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhongli</p>
<p>Headaches and dizziness in women are frequently seen, affecting nine out of ten people. Superficially, they may seem unrelated, but in reality, there are underlying illnesses. When they manifest, they are severe. Before medication can be taken, books say that women consider the liver to be innate. The liver stores blood, and when the blood is deficient, the liver's yang rises, leading to headaches and dizziness. Furthermore, women's nerves are inherently more sensitive than men's. Physiologically speaking, the distribution of nerves in the reproductive organs is linked to the brain and spinal cord, so diseases of the reproductive organs can cause stimulation of the brain nerves. Symptoms include solar headaches, eyebrow bone pain, nasal tip pain, and unilateral headaches, or dizziness and blurred vision. Severe cases may involve sudden collapse. As for the main causes of the disease, such as menstruation, pregnancy and amenorrhea, insomnia and palpitations, excessive leukorrhea, excessive sexual activity, postpartum imbalances, or severe uterine cancer, these symptoms are particularly pronounced. Some occur once a month, like dysmenorrhea, which is called periodic headache. Usually, attention should be paid to rest and opening up the mind. In terms of treatment, in addition to addressing the main symptoms, it is appropriate to nourish the blood and calm the liver, suppress latent yang, such as Shi Ciming's Zuo Mu Li Ci Shi Dai Mei Xi Li Bai Shao Gou Qi Shou Wu, and in severe cases, it is difficult to be effective without using antelope horn powder and Long Chi.</p>
<h3>The Past and Future of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital</h3>
<p>— Cheng Guoshu</p>
<p>During my clinical breaks, I often lament that the suffering of illness is unavoidable, and seeking medical treatment and taking medicine is a matter of course. However, I often see mild illnesses turning severe, and severe illnesses turning critical, or relapsing after illness, ultimately leading to death. Why is this? I think the reasons can be summarized in three points: Store employees, factory workers, and those living away from home, lonely and helpless, when they fall ill, they are bound to moan in bed, and when they look around, they are alone. There is a lack of people to serve the medicine stove and tea kettle. This is the lack of attentive care, which leads to the aggravation of the illness. This is the first reason. Ordinary citizens, if they suffer from infectious diseases, several family members are bound to infect each other one after another, occurring simultaneously. This is the poor environment, which leads to the aggravation of the illness. This is the second reason. The changes in the condition are unpredictable, and visits from relatives and friends are frequent. The noise often makes the patient feel uneasy, or there is no dietary restraint, and greasy and savory foods are consumed indiscriminately. This is the lack of common sense, which leads to the aggravation of the illness. This is the third reason. I have realized this, which is why the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital was established.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the thirty-first year, 594 Beijing West Road, which is now the site of the hospital, was selected. Active planning and arrangements were made for everything, and on March 11 of the following year, it officially opened. A diagnosis department was added, and the News Daily Social Service column specially arranged for the hospital to admit free patients, so as to seek welfare for the society and fulfill the responsibilities of the hospital. In August of the thirty-sixth year, due to the increasing number of inpatients, the wards were insufficient, so additional wards were added to meet the needs of the environment and beautify the appearance of the hospital. Now, as we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the hospital's founding, looking back on the past, we dare not boast of our achievements, but we will exhaust our wisdom and devote our efforts to encourage ourselves in the future. We will only adhere to our original intentions and carry them through to the end. As for our wishes for the future, we can say that in terms of improvement, we must strive to integrate Chinese and Western medicine, learn from each other's strengths and discard their weaknesses, so that the diagnosis is accurate and the treatment is rapid. We hope that enlightened people from all walks of life and advanced colleagues will provide us with guidance and assistance. This is what our colleagues sincerely pray for.</p>
<h3>A Preview of the Exhibition of Historical Medical and Pharmaceutical Relics</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Chinese medicine and pharmacy have a history of invention that predates any other country in the world. Its treasures are infinite, but we rarely explore them, and the essence cannot be expressed, which is deeply regrettable. Moreover, it has been passed down for thousands of years, and famous doctors have emerged in large numbers, which is enough for future generations to emulate. Now, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital is celebrating its fifth anniversary, and a special exhibition of historical medical and pharmaceutical relics is being held for three days. The intention is profound. I am honored to have been invited by President Cheng and to have the pleasure of a preview, which I am particularly happy about. The exhibition hall is divided into two parts. The first room is for medical and pharmaceutical relics, mostly the handwritings of famous doctors. The most valuable ones are the Tang Materia Medica, Song Wen Tianxiang's "Compassionate Children Scroll," Yuan Dynasty celebrities Shen You and others' scroll sending Shen Boxin's doctor Liang Hui Tang, Ming Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, Qing Fu Qingzhu's annotation of Zixu Fu, Ye Tianshi's and Chen Lianfang's handwritten prescriptions, Lu Jiuzhi's legacy, He Hongfang's hand scroll, and modern Ding Ganren's, Xia Yingtang's, and Chao Songting's prescriptions, displaying no less than a hundred items, a dazzling array, a feast for the eyes. The other room is for the exhibition of medicines. Precious medicines such as antelope horn, rhinoceros horn, monkey dates, bezoar, and blood amber are displayed, and detailed analyses are provided to distinguish the genuine from the fake. I deeply feel that this event promotes the inherent national essence and medical and pharmaceutical culture, and the meaning is not shallow, and it is indeed a great sight to behold.</p>
<p>[Editor's Note]</p>
<p>Exhibition dates: April 18, 19, and 20, for three days. Location: 594 Beijing West Road, Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital. Zhu Renkang</p>
<h3>The Strengths of Chinese Medicine Surgery</h3>
<p>— Zhu Renkang</p>
<p>People generally believe that Western medicine relies on surgery, but they do not know that Chinese medicine surgery has many strengths. I can briefly mention some of them to inform the world. Chinese medicine surgery has methods of internal elimination. What is internal elimination? For example, when a carbuncle appears, Chinese medicine often applies special external plasters and prescribes internal medicines to dissipate it, which can often make the swelling and toxicity disappear without a trace, avoiding surgery and suppuration. Especially for chronic external diseases, such as wandering cellulitis that erupts here and collapses there, and scrofula with numerous lumps, Western medicine surgery is ineffective, and Chinese medicine relies on this method of internal elimination to gradually transform them. This is one of its strengths.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if carbuncles and back boils are not treated properly, there is a risk of internal spread, which Western medicine calls septicemia and pyemia. If Chinese medicine encounters such diseases, it applies topical poultices to draw out the toxins and prescribes internal medicines to lift and penetrate the swelling, so that the toxins are limited to one area, only allowing local suppuration and drainage of toxins, so that they do not spread and enlarge into internal organs, turning danger into safety. This is the second of its strengths.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other strengths, but due to space limitations, I cannot discuss them in detail. I will continue to discuss them when I have time.</p>
<h3>Apricot News: Scrofula Treatment Method Publication Announcement</h3>
<p>Zhu Renkang, a surgeon, has a unique understanding of the treatment of scrofula. Based on his experience, he has written a book entitled "Scrofula Treatment Method," which details the treatment methods and leaves no detail unrevealed. He also discloses dozens of proven prescriptions. Each prescription has been verified and is now in print. Patients can pre-order it from 594 Beijing West Road for a fee of 100,000 yuan. It will be delivered immediately after publication.</p>
<h3>Physician Qian Songnian Seeks Interns</h3>
<p>The term is three years, with food and lodging provided, and a stipend given. Applicants must be male natives of Zhejiang Province, around the age of 20, studying at a Chinese medicine school or with equivalent education, and able to endure hardship. Please send a detailed resume with family information and a photograph to 444 Huang Po South Road. If qualified, an interview will be arranged. Unsuccessful applicants will not be notified.</p>
<h3>Training Class for Chinese Medicine Personnel Organized by the Chinese Medicine Association</h3>
<p>The training class for improving Chinese medicine cadres, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Chinese Medicine Association, is presided over by Jiang Wenfang and Lu Yuanlei of the association and is already being prepared. It is reported that the number of applicants is quite enthusiastic.</p>
