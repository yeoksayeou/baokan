<h3>金銀外匯黑市及套購　總統令嚴格取締　改善兌換辦法週一實施</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕確息：總統近接獲報吿，黃金。外匯近又有黑市買賣，且中央銀行辦理存款兌換金銀常爲黃牛黨套購牟利，頃已手諭治安機關，對於黃金·外匯黑市及黃牛黨套購現象，應予嚴格取締。</p>

<h3>申請須憑身份證</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕存款兌換金銀實施以來，各地兌換情形多極紊亂並有擠兌及黃牛套購圖利情事，財部及央行近兩日研討結果，已擬訂改善存款兌換金銀辦法，定於十三日開始。改善辦法之要點有三：（一）爲防止黃牛套購圖利起見，以後存款兌換金銀，改採申請登記核准通知辦法，並須本人親自憑本人之身份證辦理。凡人民兌換金銀，均須先行申請登記，憑請購申請登記書先行繳款，領取核准書，次日憑核准書及本人身份證換取黃金或銀元。銀元兌換之數目，仍按過去辦法辦理。兌換黃金之次數，並不受限制。惟對於黃牛套購，將特別注意取締。人民每兌換金銀一次時，卽在其身份證上加蓋一金字或銀字，以資查考。（二）增加兌換處所，除央行外，中國，交通，中農三行均同時辦理，俾大多數人民均有存款兌換金銀之機會。（三）輿論及一般人民之意見，對於豪富大戶搶購大量黃金均表不滿，爲防止黃金集中豪富大戶手中起見，對於豪當大戶等大量搶兌黃金者，將予以適當之限制，每人兌換黃金時，一次將以十兩爲限，惟此種限制之用意，純爲防止黃金過度集中。上述辦法，卽將於十三日公布施行。財部十日上午曾派要員赴央行商討執行之技術問題，並商定各種準備工作應於十二日完成。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕央行辦理存款兌換金銀，過去對于本行職員曾予以優待，不按照市民兌換辦法辦理，現除央行總裁俞鴻鈞已手諭必須按一般手續辦理外，財部新訂之改善辦法，亦嚴格規定，以後任何人均必須憑本人身份證申請登記兌換，央行職員亦不得例外。</p>

<h3>社論　聯大又不歡而散了</h3>
<p>聯合國大會今天休會了。這次會期長達兩個半月之久，是前所未有的，但是這次大會一事無成，不要說議程中尙有三分之一的議案未能議及，就是巳提出討論的各項議案，也沒有一個能够商獲協議。八十多天來，我們祗看見巴黎夏樂宮中的各國代表脣槍舌劍，爭論到面紅耳赤，不肯罷休，但是對於問題的解決仍是徒費唇舌，找不到一個妥協的方案。所以這次大會不僅浪廢時問，而且糟塌金錢；各國代表團在巴黎的費用不必說，僅以大會的經費而論，兩個半月的會期也用去三十五萬六千美元，眞是得不償失。與會的各國代表作自我檢討，也承認這次會議「多辯論，少行動。」長此遷延下去，也無補實際，因此不得不決定提前休會，而將未了之事留待明年四月間在成功湖開會再議。聯合國大會的不歡而散，不僅說明了聯合國機構的孱弱，有遭遇與舊國際聯盟類似的厄運之虞，而且也顯示出目前國際局勢的嚴重。</p>
<p>當聯合國大會在夏樂宮開幕之際，一般政論家早就料到聯合國機構的黯淡前途，但仍希望它能安然渡過各種嚴重的考騐，而能成為維持世界和平的有效國際機構。不料事與願違，聯大一經開幕之後，「冷戰」的陰影立即投射入夏樂宮·在冷戰的第一個同合中，蘇聯代表維辛斯基無往而不採取主動，從主張縮軍三公之一，到禁用原子武器，無一不是蘇聯代表的主動建議，大有迫令西方列强攤牌之勢。因此，馬歇爾和貝文便以「威脅世界和平」的「柏林封鎖問題」，作為反擊蘇聯的「冷戰」武器。但是這個柏林問題碓正是聯大所面臨的最嚴厲的考騐，此一問題的能否解決，實為聯合國機構有效與否的試金石。故眞正愛護聯合國機構的人，對於聯大處理柏林問題，莫不提心吊胆，為聯合國的前途担憂。</p>
<p>安全理事會中的六個中立國，對於柏林問題的調處，確實盡了奔走的能事，賴伊與伊瓦特的主張四强重開談判，尤不失為打開柏林僵局的初步。但英美方面，固堅持先解除柏林封鎖，然後四强重開談判的態度，而蘇聯更認為柏林封鎖乃是央美分裂德國政策的後果，不能倒果為因，也仍堅持着先談判而後解除封鎖的熊度。最後，蘇聯雖也表示讓步，使柏林問題似獲轉機，但仍主張柏林採行統一幣制應與解除封鎖同時進行，同時完成，又為英美法三國所拒絕，因此節外生枝，使柏林問題</p>
<p>一波未平，一波又起，柏林問題尙未打開僵局，而最感棘手的巴勒斯坦問題與朝鮮問題，又提出討論了·不要說美蘇兩國代表對於這幾個問題發表意見是針鋒根對的，就是中美澳三個所提出的成立一「新韓國委員會」一案，也為蘇聯所拒絕；因此朝鮮問題也就和柏林間題一樣，，以「不了了之」的方式拖延下去。美國代理首席代表杜勒斯，對於朝鮮問題的陷於僵局，憤憤不平，在聯大政治委員會中大聲疾呼，以恐怖暴力威脅全世界為理由，要求聯合國各國團結一致。他說：「如世界非共產主義之國家團結一致，反對共黨之策略，則凡專恃武力脅迫及恐怖暴力等手段以謀達到某項國際政治目的者，當可知難而退，和平之最大希望，實繫於此。」杜氏的話。誠極痛快，且為一針見血之綸；但是我們却要問，美國旣欲反共，旣明知非共產主義之國家應團結一致，則為什麽要「先歐後亞」？又為什麽要把反共先鋒的中國置於不顧？美國對外政策缺少堅定性，前後矛盾，實為造成目前僵局的因素之一。不進則退，在進退之間，是不容美國徘徊瞻顧的。美國這種一面以「反共」相號召，一面待中國蹈上了「反共」的百尺樓，而中途「掇將梯子去」的態度，實在與反共國家團結一致之主旨背道而馳的。我們盼望美國速作明智的抉擇！</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓九日電〕蘇聯駐美大使潘友新今日發表文吿，宣佈美國在遠東委員會中拒絕蘇聯對日政策之建議。大使稱：蘇聯之對日政策，「可使日本和平工業自由發展，而禁止日本之戰爭工業」。大使又稱：其他盟國之拒絕蘇聯建議，乃表示彼等希望日本為其所用。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕遠東委員會今日以十票對一票否決蘇聯主張設立國際機構以防止日本戰時工業復活案。先是，美代表麥考埃宣布，日本財閥已大抵解散，美國所提管制計劃，卽遠東委員會訓令第二三〇號，亦已失去時效，更無須設立新管制機構。其他代表均贊助美國主張。</p>
<h3>美遠東政策　在日建反共堡壘</h3>
<p>對亞洲大陸能度灰澀</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十日電〕此間許多外國觀察家，均認為目前美國之遠東政策，係在日本建立反共之基地，而非亞洲大陸。渠等並認為此項政策在將來更將漸趨明顯，除非美國之政策作主要轉變，決定作最後嘗試，以挽救中國政府之危機，此種事實必不致變更，但無論如何，日本將為美國及共產亞洲間之「寳際堡壘」，則毫無疑問。日本人仕希望美國之大量投資，因此渠等亟願共黨能在中國被阻，日本人仕亟願中國政府能克服危機。因渠等認為，共產中國對日本當局實際之威脅，因此，日本人仕亦急待美國擴大援華。</p>
<h3>杜魯門指非美會　給人戴「紅帽子」</h3>
<p>該會責社氏阻撓人民意願</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統與衆院非美活動委員會委員等，九日對關於該委會共黨間諜之調查重起爭執。杜氏在記者招待會中，重新控斥該委會之調查政府中共黨為給人戴紅帽子之舉，幷謂渠認為該委會調查人員旨在出風頭。該委會兩共和黨委員蒙特德主席及聶克遜衆議員，立卽駁以杜魯門正在繼續「阻撓該委會」，幷斥杜氏之聲明為「罪惡昭彰，蔑視人民之重要意願」。</p>
<h3>英商務部長　有受賄嫌疑　向內閣提出辭職</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十日電〕英商務部出席國會之部長貝爾契，最近向內閣提出辭職後，今日向新聞界宣稱：渠本人將繼續出席衆院，並仍為工黨黨員。按貝爾契之辭職，係由史丹萊事件而起，史丹萊曾被控向數官吏納賄，現正由法院在調查中。傳說中之英內閣改組消息卽與貝爾契之辭職有關。據「每日郵報」稱：首相艾德禮對於貝爾契受賄案，法院方面所提出之報吿書，正在加以研究，關於內閣之是否改組，須視此項研究之結果而定。</p>
<h3>德國一醫生　自行割治盲腸</h3>
<p>渠自稱施用手術後卽返家</p>
<p>〔中央社漢堡十日合衆電〕三十七歲之德國醫生赫爾頃稱，渠自已曾割治其本人之肓腸，並謂余實施手術後卽返家，並能在施行手術後之二日，照顧自身及余之病人。手術施行後，余卽能起立。醫學界權威對於赫爾所稱實施手術後，立卽離手術台，並立卽工作一點，甚表懷疑。但稱：赫爾自己施行手術一點，極有可能。</p>
<h3>美經濟援韓　雙方簽訂協定　美三年內貸款一億元</h3>

<p>〔中央社漢城十日電〕南韓各大城市今日均懸旗慶祝聯合國政委通過決議承認大韓民國。總統李承晚聲稱，聯合國此舉將加强韓政府之地位，俾與南韓之共黨周旋。南北韓統一乃大韓民國之目標，我人竭誠歡迎聯合國委員團之重返此間</p>

<h3>白吉爾中將昨正式宣布　正調美海軍來滬　聲明目的僅在保護美僑生命財產　預料英國海軍當局將作同樣措施</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕美西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾中將，昨晨在記者招待會中宣稱，渠正調遣海軍陸戰隊乘運輸艦立卽來滬，以保護美人生命財產，包括上海電力公司在內。渠稱：陸戰隊不致住在岸上軍營，將留在運輸艦上，僅在美人生命財產受咸脅時登陸，白氏解釋，在中國內戰中，並無任何干涉之意。渠復稱，日前旅滬美僑，估計約二千五百人，將來均可登於停泊外灘黃浦江中各軍艦避難。</p>
<p>白氏强調稱：派遺海軍陸戰隊，其目的僅在於萬一中國地方當局無力維持上海治安時，保護美僑之需。渠表明：對於此項計劃，美方已得中國當局之廣泛協議。白氏稱：吾人正密切注視中國情勢，如果環境有需要之時，吾人當出動相當數量之陸戰隊至上海，竭力保護生命，並在可實行之範圍內，保護商業，各項設備，以及電要美人福利。吾人不擬以美軍替代當地警察，當僅僅用於萬一地方當局無力控制情勢之時。渠將盡力向中國人士保證，美國並無任何永久活動之意。渠稱：吾人並非來此參預中國內戰，但為保護美人。欲負保護全上海所有美國財產之責顯無可能，但吾人相信能保護重要財產。將來可能令上海所有美人登軍艦避難。如情勢許可，則日間可能准予留岸工作，而於晚間返艦住宿。一俟情勢恢復正常，陸戰隊卽將撤退。對於非美國之西人之需要，渠亦將予以考慮，但不得登美艦避難。據白氏估計：京滬區有足量之商船，可於三四小時動員，使一萬八千人避免危險，予以保護。白氏對行將來滬之陸戰隊人數，拒不發表，但揣想現在靑島之陸戰隊主力，必要時可趕抵上海。</p>
<p>又據上海方面美海軍指揮人克勞福將軍稱：美海軍曾已與英海軍當局保特接觸，預料英國之保護措施，將與美國計劃相同。</p>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕美國西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾昨日再三聲明，美軍開滬並非參加中國內戰，僅　保護　人及其事業，不能代負維持治安之貢，故在局勢無法控制時期之內，祗有將美僑移居艦上</p>

<h3>中航器材南遷　職工惶恐　餓工抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司龍華機塲職工，因最近公司當局將重要器材南遷香港，而對於職工處置尙無明白表示，羣情惶恐，昨日中午曾一度餓工抗議。記者昨訪該公司負責人，據稱：公司重要器材之南遷，乃因華北業務緊縮後，為謀華南及南洋方面之發展，在香港闢立基地，故將一部份器材南遷，但並非將總機構目滬撤退。渠並謂觀察局勢，似根本不需要撤退，故職工之恐慌，乃為自相驚擾。公司當局決無逍散裁員之決定云。</p>
<h3>擠兌金銀　目擊有弊　排長憤向行員責問　對機關社團中人請兌者　頗有人主採配給性辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金銀存兌秩序，迄未有所改善，且據目擊者談，央行方面已發生舞弊等情。據昨日派走三馬路外灘央行維持秩序之憲兵第九團排長王慶及士兵胡金龍等稱：昨晨該行開始辦理發放申請書時，第一號及第三號（或為第四號）申請書，不僅為該行行負取去，且同時有一衣黃褐色西服年約三十餘之行員，跑至該處，向發放者索去一張。把守大門者亦未能盡職，曾發現一人將其子强拉入內，領取申請書。或對已兌過金銀之黃牛，臨時允其掉換身份證者，諸如此類，不一而足，故至上午十一時，該行卽以已發出一百〇七號申請書為理由，宣佈停發，一時鵠候門外之羣衆蜂擁而入，秩序為之大亂，然此時眞正排隊者，僅領到第九十七號申請書而已。當時王慶排長激於義憤，卽責問發放之行員，為何第一百號申請書未見發出，而已宣佈發放至第一〇七號？當時該行員瞠目不知所對，僅稱：渠只管發申請書，不管號碼。其中情形，大堪玩味。</p>
<p>按日來存兌情形，目見耳聞，確已弊端重重，除製造一批職業黃牛，及為少數人造成發財機會外，奉公守法之社會人士，已根本無存兌機會。據聞頗有人主張對機關社團，採取配給性質之存兌辦法，以補救現行辦法之缺點云。</p>
<h3>存款兌黃金　每次限十兩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕存款兌現業務，自經改為憑身份證發兌後，擁擠情形迄未改善，且每紙申請書對兌金數量並無限制，故遇有鉅額之兌戶，點鈔時間不無延冗，影響及於大量之小額兌戶。中央銀行有鑒於此，昨起又改變辦法，每人每次以兌購黃金十兩為限，惟對兌換次數，並不限制。兌換銀元辦法依奮不變。相信經過改變後，黃金得較以前普遍供應，分發號單亦可較前增加。昨日起中中交農四行均已照新法辦理。</p>
<p>又中央銀行昨特公告，凡各界持有該行九日以前之申請書者，統限於九日兌訖。</p>
<h3>警備部門前亦擁擠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕軍警存兌金銀，自規定先在警備司令部申請後，迄今已有兩日，因每日發出申請許可書祗限二百張，而前往申請之軍人，為數恒在六七百人以上，以致司令部門前擁擠不堪。警備司令陳大慶並規定自卽日起，凡申請存兌黃金在五兩以上者，不但必須具有現役軍人之身份證件及證明其正當用途，並得由陳司令規自接見，個別談話後，始可允准。</p>

<h3>本季第一次　精彩足球賽　青白冠軍姿態　一示力勝東星</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市體育記者聯誼會主辦之足球友誼賽，青白東星昨日會師逸園，兩隊勢均力敵，旗鼓相當，在極度緊張之形勢中，青白以寶貴之一球得勝，擊敗東星，上半時零比零雙方俱無記錄。競爭之劇烈，表演之精彩，尙為本季初見，逸園座上，球迷八千餘人，盛况空前。裁判沈回春巡邊陳吉祥何春暉。</p>
<p>靑白以一比零擊敗東星，充份表現其冠軍姿態，開賽後二十分鐘，靑白開始取得優勢，惟一再猛攻均無結果，下半時之局勢，仍在靑白控制下，卒由高保正攻入一球，奠定勝利。東星久攻不下，士氣漸衰，無法挽救。雙方實力，論守衛不相上下，靑白有嚴士鑫孟義良，東星有吳祺祥鄭秉彝。前鋒之靈活。則靑白之小羅阿福保正，除費春華稍形遜色外，益以金祿生，其動作之美妙，東星當嘆弗如。東星勇則有餘，智尙不足，每到門前，缺少攻門鞋子，設無祺祥居後，失球之數，奚止一隻。靑白上半時猛攻不下，下半時以高保正調前，鋒綫遂大為生色，足見佈陣之時，與勝利殊有莫大關係。</p>
<p>三時開賽，東星開球，雙方相持不下，東星銳氣方盛，屢攻不已，但一無成就，約計二十分鐘，靑白形勢漸轉，借阻於祺祥，亦徒然望門興嘆，陷於苦戰半小時餘，仍然一雙鴨蛋。休息後重行登塲，高保正調任前鋒，劉體寅下野，甫經接觸，僅二分鐘，小費在邊綫急進，遙送門前，高保芷接住，機會極佳，一可中之球，竟一飛冲天。七分鐘後，又見靑白進白，小羅得球，在左方邊綫直進，金祿生轉向中央呼應，史大法李承先，俱被一旋而過，進抵底綫，急向中傳，瞿永福門前一擱，高保正候過正着，低頭一頂，好容易球入網內。球路之淸晰，傳遞之美妙，八千觀衆，大為折服。靑白先開紀錄，東星門前，滿城風雨，金祿生又是一吊，惜瞿永福未曾頂中。靑白攻勢銳利，未見成功。及時間將畢，史大法被嚴士鑫一碰，門外三十碼處，得罰任意球，高送門前，張吉良趁勢一揮，球中門木彈下，竟未入網，此球不進，東星之希望遂成泡影，勝負亦有幸不幸也。銀笛長鳴，靑白以一比零奏凱。</p>

<h3>外匯資產換發移轉證　簽證手續在研究中　多數主張採分期制度以免影響市塲</h3>
<p>關於移存中央銀行之人民所有外匯資產，換發外匯移轉證一事，各有關機關，日來正縝密研究中。頃據金融當局人士稱，是項辦法，原則上業巳決定定。目前各方所研究者，係該項移轉證簽發之時間及方式。彼謂：據各有關人士所提出之意見，對於此項移轉證之簽發，均主張仍採分期制度，藉免大量簽發，而影響市塲價格。至於進口商及商業行莊方面人士，則對此咸抱懷疑之態度。彼等認為政府此項決定，是否能使原有人不蒙受損失，認為頗難斷言。彼等咸集中注意於時局之發展及輸入審核尺度之放寬，蓋彼等認為此二　，將直接決定今後移轉證之價格故也。</p>
<h3>棉紗盤旋趨堅　布疋人心看好價再上升</h3>
<p>棉紗做開均見穩秀，客路去化仍狹，使廣東台灣方面略有銷路，複製業採辦亦鮮，至於公用事　加價一倍左右，有關棉紗成本，故執有者扳價少售，價乃盤旋趨堅。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由一二五〇〇元原盤開出，中途雖曾拉至一二八〇〇元，但最後仍回至一二六〇〇元收市，結果較前微升一〇〇元。餘如寳光金城等亦挺一〇〇元至二〇〇元，四〇支藍鳳好起七〇〇元，三二支藍鳳及銀月各漲六〇〇元。</p>

<h3>絲綢平軟</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况微見升騰，走勢平庸，塲上吐納仍稀，交易未見暢旺。一百號天橋九五〇〇元喊開，中間微軟微堅，市價步高步低，市氣鮮少波動。收市以九六〇〇元了結。東洋九六〇〇元做開後，亦因實銷不動，散戶觀望，人心無任何刺激，市况盤旋甚久，迨至收市以九七〇〇元結束，軋升百元。</p>
<p>生絲外銷市價昨日無何上落，洋行帮納胃微細，交易不多，內銷貨因連日漲勢未高，昨日人心着好，塲上買氣轉濃，市價緩步上升〇級七八匀度一三〇〇〇元有成交，續升五百元。優級零担普通零担均跟升五百元。</p>
<p>綢絲昨日市况續疲，塲上依然出多進少，市勢一蹶不振，人心繼續看小，收市均見挺跌。華强初開七四〇〇元，中間吐納平均，直至收市績小二〇〇元，午後買氣稍轉，客銷略有進意，喊價高三百元。</p>
<h3>外匯移轉證下跌　買進者爲數甚少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯移轉證行情，前因央行委托其他國家銀行大量購進，遂作直綫上升，竟達五十元之高額。後因台灣出口商人有大量供應，為數達三百萬美元以上，一時供過於求，行情疲落，昨晨由四十八元之價格，跌至中午四十六元，買者尙稀少。據出口商方面之意見，在移轉證行情暴落時，希望央行積極扶持。</p>
<p>又訊，輸管會息：已付款自備外匯物資申請進口所發之許可證，本月二日至八日共核准美金六萬八千七百廿五元五角五分，及港幣一萬零四百元，連前共計美金五十四萬六百四十二元四角一分，港幣一萬五千一百八十元。</p>

<h3>銀根鬆現鈔緊</h3>
<p>昨日市間銀根，鬆勞仍吿持續。市塲拆息，始終起伏於日拆廿元至卅元間，合月息六角至九角，多數均以七角五分成交。頭寸供求均旺，現鈔籌碼，則仍吿匱，業內行莊重又限制提領。有限取二百元者。此中原因：據悉，（一）兌換金銀均需現鈔，兌換金銀者，紛紛設法現鈔，金圓劵回籠後，現鈔致吿缺乏。（二）各地申匯雖巳回低，但朱抑平，一般貨帮，大量携帶現鈔出境，以奪取申匯，亦為現鈔缺乏之最大原因。</p>
<h3>百物下跌聲中　出口物資獨漲</h3>
<p>近來本市百物下跌，惟出口物資則反見上　。上海桐油，每担已由六百元而躍升至八百五十元，漢口已升至六百元，重慶萬縣巴升至四百五十元至五百元不等。至于猪鬃，上海四十分配箱亦已上升至每担一萬七千元。聞昨日紐約猪鬃，我國各類猪鬃行情報好，國內售價一致看高。據業內人士稱，上漲原因，由（一）近來出口商雖紛紛脫貨求現，前往台穗，但終不如直接出口商品運至合穗為穩妥可靠。（二）由于時局關係，前往產區收購商人採辦轉疏，本市貨源稀少，存底又枯之故。（三）外匯移轉證售價上揚，出口利潤較前大增，出口商爭購。</p>
<h3>上週申請輸入　較前减三之一</h3>
<p>據輸管會息，上週（十二月二日至八日）按中央銀行外幣外匯支付辦法申請輸入者，共二十一件，金額六八，七二五·五五美元，港幣一〇，四〇〇元，較之前週申請卅件，金額九二，七六八·六七元，巳减少三分之一。若分類計，則申請輸入附表一之生產器材者九件，金額三二，〇六七·一〇美元，港幣一〇，四〇〇元。輸入附表二元工業原料渚六件，金額一七，八九六·八〇美元。輸入附表三甲之必需品者一八，七六一·六五美元云。</p>
<h3>到貨仍多去化不暢　食米欲振無力　麵粉轉疲食油走勢甚俏</h3>
<p>食米昨到貨仍湧，兩市塲八六九九石五斗，內南市塲四六三五石五斗，北市塲四〇六四石，市况略漲。以前市產地軋升二十元，然納胃不暢，市價欲漲乏力，結果南北二市各檔食米均微升五元。南市白粳三五五元，薄稻三五〇元，早稻三三〇元，羊秈三六二元。北市白粳三六〇元，薄稻三四〇元，早稻三二五元，羊秈三五〇元，白元三六〇元。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>麵粉轉疲，銷路呆頓，人心懈怠，市價一致微挫。兵船粉開一二七元，收市一二九元，下疲三元·老車粉開一三九元，收市一三七元，亦疲落四元。其他雜牌粉一致略疲三四元不等，紅蜂粉一二六元，建成粉一二三元，地球一三〇元，燈塔一三二元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>雜糧昨到貨尙湧，銷路尙暢，生仁猛挺，南京生仁四〇〇元，較昨市升起五十元，揚州生仁近六〇〇元關，以五七〇元成交，奶蔴繼續挺俏，九江奶蔴三〇〇元，再升三元。紅糧亦挺起十元，姜堰紅糧一〇〇元，元麥苞米平平，供求相埒。黃豆本街有納，市勢向上，各挺升十餘元。漢口乍豆一五五元，浦東杜豆一九五元，升起十元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>食油再升，走勢甚銷，業內銀根鬆弛，市價一致上挺，靑島吉桶陳貨九三〇元，升起三十元，江北吉桶生油九四〇元，亦挺三十元。本廠豆油市况盤旋，開八九〇元高盤，中市再挺至九〇○元，後市回至八五〇元，收盤為八六〇元，較昨市微升十元。生菜油七七〇元，開七六〇元，收市亦挺起六〇元，熟菜油轉秀三〇元，重慶熱菜油六二〇元，吉桶小車九二〇元，轉挺二〇元。豆餅微秀，長字餅七七元，上升一·二元。</p>
<h3>食糖平軟</h3>
<p>食糖運日市况疲軟，執戶觀望不售，客銷雖未轉好，本街略有進胃，惟走勢依然疲軟，各檔除四五號車白情微升二三外，其餘仍多挫跌。</p>
<h3>外銷茶平庸</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，賣戶扳拾之念，雖若雨後春筍，怒茁不戢，但外銷箱茶，終因輸出商胃納平庸，過程再昂維艱，而在原途掙扎。至於內銷花色，本街等地去化依然絡繹，市氣迂迴復堅，尤以低檔粗茶，求者更殷，形勢倍覺絢爛。</p>
<h3>桐油徘徊</h3>
<p>桐油昨市又趨盤旋局面，良以自各方實需轉狹以來，同業間俱有門可羅雀之勢，致賣戶雖因到存兩稀，而圖扳抬，終感無力續升，迨至收市，徘徊不變。足度白油每担六四〇元，正牌西洪每桶五八〇元，餘均膠着原途。</p>

<h3>流民新圖　杭州冬景速寫</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州八日訊〕連年的烽火，在蚌宿會戰緊張的今日，這靜靜地恬適的天堂也不由得震驚了起來。那是桐　蕭疏，　條老去的仲冬季節，柔美的四子湖也寥落起來了。</p>
<p>這是由京滬帶來的震動，也是由京滬帶來的流言。城站，這個交通的吐納口，由人擠　　成混亂，由混亂而變成騷動，從京滬到杭州城站來的人，多半都想轉往江西，廣東，廣西，貴州，他們儘可能的把所有一切箱籠帶定。他　自認為已是第六等的逃難者，因為第一等　　飛機到美國。第二等到香港，第三等到台灣，第四等至廣州第，五等坐船到台灣或到廣州，第六等才由陸路到廣州或內地。從此，杭州人民眼看一批批的逃難者，耳聽一條條的「馬路新聞」，怎不叫人乾着急？</p>
<p>車站舖床疊被　變成臨時宿舍</p>
<p>逃難者愈多了。大家都想舒適，因以都想坐浙贛路的臥舖車，退而求其次的對號頭二等車，也被擠定一空。浙贛路，它又重荷了艱鉅的任務，它剛才修復不久，又遭逢到第二次的大難。</p>
<p>後來，又有人傳說京滬車都不要票就上車，只要擠得上就行，於是浙贛路的乘客們竟也躍然一試，於是不按班次，隨到隨開，可憐浙贛路本想在修復後可以休養生息，現在已成泡影了。</p>
<p>浙贛路車廂不多，行車密度也不多，於是很多逃亡者紫興在站上舖床疊被，做起臨時宿舍來，有的人以箱籠疊成界綫，有的人以繩索攬成界綫，更有的人在角落裏燃起鍋爐，烹調飯菜。</p>
<p>流浪到那年？　逃亡到何方？</p>
<p>有很多人是這樣想的：「當元代入侵的時候江南小康了很多年，淸代打南京，也要費很多功夫，而杭州又非兵家必爭之地，大可在此小住」。在這一種念頭下，搬來杭州住宿的人實在不少。但是在杭州的人又有另一種想法：「杭州，雖非兵家必爭，但是到底還是可怕的，所以還是跑上海為好，否則，也得跑江西或內地。」在這一種念頭下，逃亡到上海以及其他內地的杭州住民，也漸漸在多起來了。</p>
<p>最近，有人從江西九江，南昌逃到杭州來的，他們覺得那裏也並不安全。安全，安全，到底什麼地方才安全呢？眞是「流浪到那年？逃亡到何方」啊！</p>
<p>英士街一畝地　討金條十五根</p>
<p>據京滬來的人說：「南京的房屋，地價，一切物件，都特別便宜。」但杭州到沒有這個現象，反而顯得貴起來了。英士街一畝地，要討價十五根火條，一間小房屋也要一條頂費，月租白米一石，各家商店，並沒有掛出廉價的市招，反而較上海要加一二成，例如普通絨綫，上海僅賣一百二十元一磅，杭州却要賣一百六十元一磅。</p>
<p>旅館茶館客滿　歌女神女風行</p>
<p>杭州的旅館，再度宣吿客滿，行李箱籠堆得滿坑滿谷，湖濱幾家旅館巳經不能再容納了，城站更不必說，連茶館也做了臨時旅邸。可是裏西湖的幾家如西泠，新新，蝶來等旅館，生意却不見得好，因為今天的旅客，正不是來找什麼「賞心樂事」的，而是為着逃亡來的。他們要離開交通據點愈近愈好。　浙省府為了使車站恢復秩序，特將去滬者由長山門上車，去贛者由南星橋上車，從此南星橋又將是一幅中等流民圖了。</p>
<p>在杭州，咖啡館重又盛行。咖啡館內，歌女唱的是靡靡的樂曲，「坐橙子」，一化就是百數十元，滿不在乎。賭風也有發現，英士街頭的「夜鶯」（神女）也都有了主顧，她們不像從前那樣的立在冷風苦雨中受煮熬了。</p>
<p>流亡學生成羣　在杭尋求食宿</p>
<p>另有一個鏡頭，就是流亡來的學生，他們百千成羣，好幾天沒有飯吃，到杭州以為可以安頓下來，那裏知道杭州站上也顯得混亂，他們是拋家別親的來到異鄉，情緒是相當的壞，於是有許多動作都無意間表露了出來。杭州的市政府總算是負責的，為他們解決食宿，但流亡學生去了一批又一批，不斷的來，不斷的去，眞是「流浪到那年？逃亡到何方」啊！</p>

<h3>The Bengbu-Suzhou Campaign Becomes More Promising; Northern Expeditionary Forces Forcefully Cross the Xie River and Continue Advance; Deng Wenyi Carries President's Handwritten Letter to the Frontlines to Encourage the Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] The progress of the Nationalist forces in the central and southern battlefields of the Bengbu-Suzhou campaign indicates that the initial victory of this campaign is imminent. According to the current battle situation, the convergence of Huang Wei and Li Yannian's army corps will occur tomorrow or the day after. Li Yannian, at the frontlines, expressed his extremely optimistic assessment to a certain general, stating that the Liu Fei's Second Column and Chen Fei's Sixth Column, which are obstructing between the Huang and Li positions, will inevitably face complete annihilation. Note: Today, intense battles are taking place in all three major battlefields within the Bengbu-Suzhou war zone. Since Li's army corps intensified its attack northward, Liu Fei's main force has been launching fierce attacks on Huang's army corps positions. In the southeast of Shuangzhunji, the bandits have captured several villages, and the small airfield of the Nationalist forces in that area was once threatened. Today, that unit has retaken the area in a bloody battle, and has also routed a bandit division. Today, under the cover of an armored vehicle group commanded by Chief of Staff Jiang Weiguo, Li's army corps captured Dagouji (30 li northwest of Huoshen Temple) in one fell swoop, separated by only 40 li from Dayingji, the southeastern stronghold of Huang's army corps. In addition, Mr. Deng Wenyi arrived in Bengbu from Nanjing by special plane this afternoon, and immediately traveled by car to the frontlines to deliver the President's handwritten letter to Li Yannian and the commanders of various units. Encouraged by the President, the generals were able to achieve this significant progress on the southern front.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] It is reliably learned that the vanguard of a Nationalist army unit advancing northward along the Jinpu Railway has reached the vicinity of Guzhen. It is reported that there are only a few remnant bandits near the iron bridge, and the Nationalist army will soon capture the area. Furthermore, according to informed sources, the supplies for the army corps marching south from Xuzhou are now being airdropped.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] After continuous days of battle, the current situation of the Nationalist army's Qiu and Li army corps marching south is as follows: Qiu's army corps is positioned northeast of Yongcheng, and Li's army corps is near Laozulou. Between the two army corps, the Bandit's Liangguang Column is in Mengji, and the First Column and New Eighth Column are in Zhangzhuangzhai. The 27th Division of the Bandit's Ninth Column is in the area of Wang Liuyuan, Huazhuang, and Liuhe, northeast of Qiu's army corps. South of the Qiu and Li army corps, there are Ji Geng's Ninth Column, Chen Yi's Third and Fourth Columns, and the Wu Huawen and He Jifeng units who defected to the bandits (in the area north of Suixikou), the Tenth and Sixteenth Columns (in Qinglongji Wangzhuang), the Third Column (in Dahui Chuan), and parts of the Seventh and Eighth Columns (southeast of Yongcheng). Note that the Nationalist army is constantly launching attacks on this line. Yesterday, they severely damaged the bandits in the areas of Mengji and Dahui Chuan, and intense battles are still taking place today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] Our southward advancing army corps has recently completed an arc-shaped encirclement against Chen Yi's bandit troops between Yongcheng and Suixikou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 10th Dispatch] This morning, the Nationalist army's Li Yannian army corps in Huaibei crossed the Heji Huoshenmiao line, forcefully crossed the Xie River, and advanced more than ten li to the northwest, further closing the distance with Huang Wei's army corps. On the evening of the 9th, Huang Wei's army corps engaged in fierce battles with the bandits all night in the vicinity of Nanpingji and Shuangduiji, south of Su County. Both sides fired thousands of shells. Huang Wei's army corps is still expanding outward.

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Neutral sources believed on the 10th that the war in the triangular region of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan may be decided in the next few days. Both the Nationalists and Communists have placed their most elite troops in this war zone. In fact, the Nationalist army has the advantage, because since the Battle of Xuzhou, most of the Communist army has been on the front lines, while the Nationalist army has an endless supply of reinforcements arriving on the front lines. Another advantage of the Nationalist army is that it has better transportation lines and supply bases.</p>

We cannot compromise with communism, nor can we compromise with evil.</p>

<h3>Pan Yukun in Changsha</h3>
<p>Remaining Indoors and Refusing Visitors, Intentions Passive</p>

<h3>The President Orders Strict Suppression of Black Market and Arbitrage for Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange; Improved Exchange Methods to be Implemented on Monday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] It is reliably learned that the President recently received reports that there has been black market trading of gold and foreign exchange again recently, and that the Central Bank's handling of deposit exchange of gold and silver is often exploited by scalpers for profit. He has now handwritten instructions to the security authorities to strictly suppress the black market of gold and foreign exchange and the scalping phenomenon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The Central Bank's handling of deposit exchange of gold and silver coins has been implemented in various places. Recently, unscrupulous people have been exploiting the system for profit, openly buying and selling gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and buying silver coins at high prices. The Ministry of Finance has issued a circular to strictly suppress these activities and investigate and deal with them according to the law in order to maintain law and order.</p>
<h3>Applications Require Identification</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Since the implementation of deposit exchange of gold and silver, the exchange situation in various places has been very chaotic, and there have been incidents of bank runs and scalpers profiting from arbitrage. After research and discussion in the past two days, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have formulated improved methods for deposit exchange of gold and silver, which will be implemented on the 13th. There are three main points of the improved methods: (1) In order to prevent scalpers from profiting from arbitrage, in the future, deposit exchange of gold and silver will be changed to an application registration and approval notification method, and the applicant must personally handle it with their own identification. All people who exchange gold and silver must first apply for registration, pay the money with the purchase application registration form, and receive the approval letter. The next day, they can exchange gold or silver dollars with the approval letter and their own identification. The number of silver dollars exchanged will still be handled according to the previous method. There is no limit to the number of times gold can be exchanged. However, special attention will be paid to suppressing scalping. Each time a person exchanges gold and silver, a gold or silver character will be stamped on their identification for reference. (2) The number of exchange locations will be increased. In addition to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China will also handle the exchange at the same time, so that the majority of people will have the opportunity to deposit and exchange gold and silver. (3) Public opinion and the opinions of the general public have expressed dissatisfaction with wealthy and large households rushing to buy large amounts of gold. In order to prevent gold from being concentrated in the hands of wealthy and large households, appropriate restrictions will be placed on wealthy and large households and others who rush to exchange large amounts of gold. Each person will be limited to ten taels of gold at a time. However, the purpose of this restriction is purely to prevent excessive concentration of gold. The above methods will be announced and implemented on the 13th. Officials from the Ministry of Finance were dispatched to the Central Bank on the morning of the 10th to discuss the technical issues of implementation and agreed that various preparatory work should be completed on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] In the past, the Central Bank gave preferential treatment to its employees in handling deposit exchange of gold and silver, and did not handle it according to the exchange methods for citizens. Now, in addition to the fact that the President of the Central Bank, Yu Hongjun, has personally instructed that it must be handled according to general procedures, the new improved methods formulated by the Ministry of Finance also strictly stipulate that in the future, anyone must apply for registration and exchange with their own identification, and Central Bank employees are no exception.</p>

<h3>Jiang Tingfu Writes to American Newspaper; Denies Government Moving to Taiwan</h3>
<p>Also No Possibility of Compromise with Communists</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th Dispatch] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly today stated frankly that Chinese diplomats have no intention of compromising with any possible communist regime in Nanjing. Jiang Tingfu, the chief representative of China, issued a strongly worded statement to the editors of the New York Times, categorically denying the points contained in a special dispatch sent from Paris by C. L. Sulzberger, the newspaper's correspondent in Paris, and recently published by the newspaper. Mr. Jiang sent a telegram to the editors of the New York Times. The telegram, which was published in Paris today, stated: The Chinese delegation hereby categorically rejects the points made in the special dispatch from Paris on December 4 by C. L. Sulzberger, namely the so-called plan of the Chinese government to move to Taiwan, and that important Chinese figures will refuse to move to He Wan and are willing to "reach a harmonious relationship with the new communist regime in Nanjing." The Chinese delegation hereby announces the following points: (1) The delegation has not received reports regarding the Chinese government moving to Taiwan, or anywhere else. (2) The delegation is also unaware of so-called important Chinese figures who intend to "reach a harmonious relationship with the communist regime." (3) Chinese diplomats stationed in Paris have no intention of reaching a harmonious relationship with any communist regime in any part of China. (4) The delegation firmly believes that the establishment of a communist regime in China would mean the end of individual and national freedom in China. Please publish the statement issued by the delegation today in the same prominent position as the special dispatch from your newspaper's correspondent.</p>
<h3>Supplemental General Budget Approved; President Orders Announcement</h3>

<h3>General Survey of the Situation of Residents in the Capital Began Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Madame Chiang Meets with Truman; Methodist Bishops Urge Increased Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] President Truman hosted a tea party for Madame Chiang at 5:00 p.m. on the 10th (6:00 a.m. on the 11th Shanghai time), accompanied by the First Lady and Mrs. Marshall.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th Dispatch] President Truman indirectly indicated at a press conference on the 9th that he may meet with Madame Chiang several more times after hosting a tea party for her tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania, 10th Dispatch] After learning of the report from the bishops stationed in China regarding the current situation in China, Bishop Corson of the Methodist Church issued a statement today urging the US government to aid China. He stated, in brief, that if the United States does not save China from danger today at a smaller price, then once the Communist Party controls China, the United States will have to spend a huge cost of ten billion US dollars to revive Japanese military equipment and establish a base in the Philippines. Why should the United States hesitate and delay, and pay the small price, and instead let our children and grandchildren pay the heavy price of their ancestors' stupidity and negligence? President Chiang of China has been meritorious to the United States. At the time of the Pearl Harbor Incident, President Chiang restrained 2 million elite Japanese troops in China. If these Japanese troops were used to attack the United States, then the US operations in the Far East would have been more bloody and the time would have been longer. We are now helping President Chiang purely to express our gratitude. The bishops of the Methodist Church going to China agree with my views.</p>

Mrs. Ocksenharn said in her letter: If Madame Chiang can be elected, then the university can get a leader with excellent talent and outstanding demeanor, and can also express the concern of the American people for China. Note that Madame Chiang graduated from the school.</p>
<h3>Draft Postal and Telecommunications Inspection Regulations Amended and Approved by the Legislative Yuan; Case of Accusing the Soviet Union Handed Over to the Foreign Affairs Committee for Review; Three Cases, Including Adjusting Postal Rates, Returned to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The 27th meeting of the Second Session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 10th, starting at 9:30 a.m. Both the President and Vice President were absent due to reasons. Committee member Cheng Tianfang was elected as the chairman by public vote. After reading the report, the various bills submitted by the government for review were mostly handed over for review separately. However, the case of the Executive Yuan requesting review of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, which had been approved by the President, and requesting the Legislative Yuan to review the case of adjusting the domestic mail rate table and the case of reviewing the amended clauses of the Household Registration Law were rejected, because the documents were sent to the Legislative Yuan with the signature of "President Sun Ke". The committee members believed that Mr. Sun had not formally resigned from the position of President of the Legislative Yuan to take office as President of the Executive Yuan, and the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan had prematurely issued documents in the name of Mr. Sun, which was inappropriate, so they were not accepted. As for the draft Republic of China Red Cross Society Law, its purpose, nature, organization, etc. are mostly inconsistent with the International Red Cross Convention and the precedents of Red Cross societies in various countries. It was decided to return it to the Executive Yuan for re-amendment and then sent to the Yuan for review. After the report was completed, three confidential cases were discussed in secret: (1) The draft Regulations on Postal and Telecommunications Inspection during the Period of Suppression of the Rebellion was resolved to be amended and passed according to the review opinions. (2) Qi Zhihou and others proposed that the Soviet Union assist the CCP in occupying the Northeast and threatening world peace, and proposed that the government file a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly. (3) Liu Zhaoxun and others proposed that the government file a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly against the Soviet Union's breach of contract and bad faith, demanding that the Soviet Union fulfill the treaty, compensate for the losses, be responsible for expelling the CCP, and return the territorial sovereignty to the government. If no result is obtained, the government will immediately announce the abolition of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and related agreements in order to revitalize international prestige and maintain world peace. The two cases are similar in nature, and after a joint discussion, the debate lasted for a long time. There was no result until 11:00 a.m., and the meeting was adjourned due to a power outage. The meeting continued at 3:45 p.m., still chaired by Cheng Tianfang. As a result of the discussion of cases (2) and (3), it was decided to hand them over to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review. At 4:30 p.m., an open meeting was held to continue discussing general cases: (4) The amendment of the draft Seven Association Law was carried out in the third reading meeting, and it was resolved to pass it with slight textual amendments. (5) The cases of the Capital Garrison District (6) Shanghai City (7) Quzhou Pacification District declaring temporary martial law were resolved to be approved. (8) The Finance and Economics Committee reported on the joint review of the draft Republic of China 37th Year Consolidation Public Bond Regulations and the various bond ticket redemption and interest payment tables. Committee member Liu Zhendong and others proposed amending the Measures for Consolidating Foreign Currency and National Currency Public Bonds promulgated by the Executive Yuan to show fairness and reduce the burden on the national treasury. It was resolved to pass the Executive Yuan's original plan according to the review opinions. (9) The Legislative Yuan and Supervisory Yuan committee members' application for taking out foreign passports and the review standards were resolved to be passed according to the review opinions and sent to the Executive Yuan for reply. If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the current Foreign Passport Regulations need to be amended, it should draft an amendment and submit it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review. Before the amendment procedure is completed, it will still be handled according to past practices, and there is no need to set another temporary standard. (10) The draft Law on Subsidies and Incentives for Private Vocational Schools and Above was resolved to be passed according to the review opinions, because the Ministry of Education had already set out the General Outline of the Method for Allocating Subsidies for Private Vocational Schools and Above, and there is no need to reset it in reality. However, according to the opinions put forward by the original proposal's refined version, a question was raised to the Executive Yuan. Finally, Zhang Zhijiang, Li Yu, and others held a temporary motion to send a telegram to Sun Ke, requesting him to return to Nanjing immediately to take office as President of the Executive Yuan and form a new cabinet to promote government orders and benefit the work of suppressing the rebellion. Most committee members believed that Mr. Sun was indeed delayed in Shanghai due to illness, and there was a scheduled date for Jin Jing. It was inappropriate and unnecessary to send a telegram in the name of the Legislative Yuan. However, Li Yu and others insisted on their opinions, and finally the number of committee members present was insufficient to meet the quorum, and the vote could not be taken, so it was postponed to the next regular meeting for further discussion. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 p.m.</p>
<h3>Presidential Order Promulgated: National Martial Law Zone</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] President's order of December 10th is as follows: Now, in accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Provisions of the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Rebellion, and upon the resolution of the Executive Yuan, (1) Martial law is declared in all provinces and cities of the country except for the four provinces of Xinjiang, Xikang, Qinghai, and Taiwan, and Tibet. The demarcation of combat and alert areas is as shown in the attached map (map omitted).

<h3>Editorial: The UN General Assembly Breaks Up Unhappily Again</h3>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly adjourned today. This session lasted for a record two and a half months. However, this General Assembly achieved nothing. Not to mention that one-third of the agenda items were not discussed, none of the items that were put forward for discussion reached an agreement. For more than eighty days, we only saw the representatives of various countries in the Palais de Chaillot in Paris engaging in heated debates, arguing until they were red in the face, unwilling to give up. However, solving the problems was just a waste of words, and no compromise solution could be found. Therefore, this General Assembly not only wasted time but also wasted money. Not to mention the expenses of the delegations of various countries in Paris, the expenses of the General Assembly alone amounted to 356,000 US dollars in two and a half months, which is really not worth the loss. The representatives of the participating countries, after self-examination, also admitted that this meeting involved "more debate, less action." Prolonging it would not help the actual situation, so they had to decide to adjourn the meeting early and leave the unfinished business to be discussed at a meeting in Lake Success in April next year. The unhappy breakup of the United Nations General Assembly not only illustrates the weakness of the United Nations organization, which is in danger of encountering a similar fate to the old League of Nations, but also shows the seriousness of the current international situation.</p>
<p>When the United Nations General Assembly opened in the Palais de Chaillot, political commentators generally anticipated the bleak future of the United Nations organization but still hoped that it could safely overcome various serious tests and become an effective international organization for maintaining world peace. Unexpectedly, contrary to expectations, after the UN General Assembly opened, the shadow of the "Cold War" immediately cast itself into the Palais de Chaillot. In the first round of the Cold War, Soviet representative Vyshinsky took the initiative in everything. From advocating a one-third reduction in armaments to banning atomic weapons, all were proactive suggestions from the Soviet representative, with the intention of forcing the Western powers to show their cards. Therefore, Marshall and Bevin used the "Berlin blockade issue," which "threatened world peace," as a "Cold War" weapon to counter the Soviet Union. However, this Berlin issue was indeed the most severe test facing the UN General Assembly. Whether this issue could be resolved was truly a touchstone for whether the United Nations organization was effective or not. Therefore, those who truly cared for the United Nations organization were worried about the UN General Assembly's handling of the Berlin issue, and concerned about the future of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The six neutral countries in the Security Council have indeed done their best to mediate the Berlin issue. The proposals of Lie and Evatt for the four powers to reopen negotiations were still a preliminary step in breaking the Berlin stalemate. However, the British and American sides insisted on lifting the Berlin blockade first, and then the four powers reopening negotiations. The Soviet Union believed that the Berlin blockade was a consequence of the Anglo-American policy of dividing Germany and could not put the cart before the horse, and still insisted on negotiating first and then lifting the blockade. Finally, although the Soviet Union also expressed concessions, making the Berlin issue seem to have taken a turn for the better, it still insisted that the implementation of a unified currency system in Berlin should be carried out simultaneously with the lifting of the blockade, which was rejected by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Therefore, additional problems arose, causing the Berlin issue to</p>
<p>have one wave not yet subsided before another rose. Before the Berlin issue could break the stalemate, the most thorny issues of Palestine and Korea were raised for discussion. Not to mention that the opinions expressed by the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union on these issues were diametrically opposed, even the proposal by China, the United States, and Australia to establish a "New Korean Committee" was rejected by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Korean issue, like the Berlin issue, was delayed in an "inconclusive" manner. US Acting Chief Representative Dulles, indignant at the stalemate in the Korean issue, loudly appealed in the UN Political Committee, threatening the entire world with terror and violence, and calling on the UN countries to unite. He said: "If the non-communist countries of the world unite to oppose the Communist Party's strategy, then those who rely solely on military coercion and terror to achieve certain international political goals will know that it is difficult to succeed, and the greatest hope for peace lies in this." Mr. Dulles' words are extremely painful and a penetrating judgment. However, we must ask, since the United States wants to oppose communism, since it knows that non-communist countries should unite, then why "Europe first, Asia second"? And why should it disregard China, the vanguard of anti-communism? The lack of firmness and the inconsistency of US foreign policy are indeed factors that have created the current stalemate. If you don't advance, you retreat. Between advancing and retreating, the United States cannot hesitate. The United States' attitude of calling for "anti-communism" on one hand and waiting for China to climb the hundred-foot tower of "anti-communism" and then "removing the ladder midway" is completely contrary to the purpose of uniting anti-communist countries. We hope that the United States will make a wise choice soon!</p>

<h3>Seven Countries Proposed a Supplementary Plan for the Holy Land; UN General Assembly Will Definitely Pass; Korea and Human Rights Declaration Commence Final Intense Debate; UN General Assembly Set to Conclude Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] Seven important countries of the United Nations formally moved on the 10th that the Bernadotte Plan will no longer be mentioned in the future. This happened when the UN General Assembly was trying hard to break the East-West conflict over the Declaration of Human Rights. After numerous lengthy speeches, the final actions on the Palestine and Korea issues will be taken, as the 11th is the closing day of the General Assembly. The new motion on Palestine is not unexpected. In the past few days, the original proposals of the UK and US have been constantly revised in order to reduce the components of the original proposal so that the General Assembly can finally pass it by a two-thirds majority. (Note: Bernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem shortly before the opening of the UN General Assembly. His proposed Holy Land plan was quickly accepted by the West and intended to be used as the basis for resolving the Holy Land dispute. But now it has lost its moving nature.) The supplementary proposal has been jointly proposed by France, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, and Brazil, and does not mention the Bernadotte Plan at all. This case will definitely be passed by the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority. The original British and American proposal advocated that the mediation committee be appointed by the five powers. The supplementary case has been cancelled, and even the powers of the committee have been greatly reduced. The seven countries intend to cancel the suggestion of instructing the mediation committee to "promote friendly relations between the Holy Land of Israel and its Arab neighbors." Its functions will be clearly stipulated by the UN General Assembly or the Security Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] UN officials announced today that the Israeli government has notified Palestinian Acting Mediator Bunche that it agrees to gradually withdraw its troops from the southern Negev region through negotiations.

<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] Israel's slim hope of joining the United Nations this year was wiped out on the 9th when the Security Council cancelled the 10th meeting to consider this issue. The cancellation of the meeting was due to the illness of US Representative Jessup. According to US law, Mr. Jessup is the only representative who can vote for the United States in the Security Council. He is currently hospitalized with bronchitis.</p>
<h3>Churchill Encourages Government to Try to Stop the Cold War between East and West; Advocates Restoring Relations with Spain</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Conservative Party leader Churchill spoke in the House of Commons foreign policy debate today, urging the government to try to end the Cold War between East and West, and to reconcile with the Soviet Union before it possesses atomic bombs. Britain should restore diplomatic relations with Spain and immediately send a representative to the State of Israel.</p>
<p>Churchill declared that the UK and the US should maintain cooperation, because the close unity of English-speaking countries is closely tied to human freedom and the hope for the survival of most of us. Regarding German policy, Churchill pointed out that France, which has suffered the most, should be allowed to lead Germany back to the European international family in this situation. Churchill also criticized the Labor Party's policy on Palestine, saying that no policy in the government's policy is more wrong and improperly handled than the Palestine policy. (The above is Agence France-Presse's dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Intensifies Berlin Blockade, Automobile Traffic Cut Off</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 10th] The division of Berlin is becoming increasingly apparent, with automobile traffic between East and West Berlin cut off on the 10th. New Soviet instructions direct German police to prevent vehicles from crossing the border at the demarcation line in the city center. The new traffic ban aims to prevent goods from the Soviet-occupied zone from flowing into the West, which is another step by the Soviets to tighten the blockade around Berlin. However, underground and elevated trains can still travel between East and West Berlin. Mail is still not exchanged between the two districts, and checkpoints along the Soviet border stop all vehicles, with only those holding special permits allowed to pass.</p>

<p>Urges Soviet Cooperation on Declaration of Human Rights</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] Eleanor Roosevelt gave Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky a lesson tonight during the United Nations General Assembly debate on the draft Declaration of Human Rights. Vyshinsky accused the declaration of supporting fascist breeders and glorifying warlords and murderous scientists, and said that the Soviet Union would not recognize it if the Assembly passed it in its current form. Roosevelt advocated for immediate passage, stating, "The Soviet Union's attempt to delay amending the Declaration of Human Rights until the last minute seems deliberately intended to embarrass the Assembly. We Americans admire those who fight for their beliefs. The Soviet delegation has fought for its beliefs, but sometimes we must submit to the will of the majority. When we have fought and been opposed by the majority, it is better to try to cooperate." The entire chamber responded with applause.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's New Proposal for Controlling Japan Rejected by Far Eastern Commission; US Representative Declares That Japanese Zaibatsu Have Been Largely Dissolved</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, issued a statement today announcing that the United States had rejected the Soviet Union's proposals regarding Japanese policy in the Far Eastern Commission. The ambassador stated that the Soviet Union's policy towards Japan "would allow the free development of Japan's peaceful industries, while prohibiting Japan's war industries." The ambassador also stated that the other Allied countries' rejection of the Soviet Union's proposals indicates that they want Japan to be used by them.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Far Eastern Commission today rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an international organization to prevent the revival of Japan's wartime industries by a vote of ten to one. Earlier, US Representative McCoy announced that the Japanese zaibatsu had been largely dissolved, and that the US-proposed control plan, namely Far Eastern Commission Directive No. 230, had also become obsolete, making the establishment of a new control organization unnecessary. Other representatives supported the US position.</p>
<h3>US Far East Policy: Building Anti-Communist Fortress in Japan</h3>
<p>Pessimistic About Situation on Asian Continent</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Many foreign observers here believe that the current US Far East policy is to establish an anti-communist base in Japan, rather than on the Asian continent. They also believe that this policy will become increasingly clear in the future. Unless the US policy undergoes a major shift and decides to make a final attempt to salvage the crisis of the Chinese government, this fact will not change. However, there is no doubt that Japan will be a "precious fortress" between the United States and communist Asia. Japanese officials hope for large-scale US investment and therefore eagerly desire that the communists be blocked in China. Japanese officials are eager for the Chinese government to overcome the crisis because they believe that a communist China poses a real threat to the Japanese authorities. Therefore, Japanese officials are also eager for the United States to expand aid to China.</p>

Rumors of a British cabinet reshuffle are related to Belcher's resignation. According to the "Daily Mail," Prime Minister Attlee is studying the court's report on Belcher's bribery case, and whether or not to reshuffle the cabinet will depend on the outcome of this study.</p>

<h3>Lieutenant General Badger Officially Announces He Is Transferring US Navy to Shanghai; States Purpose Is Only to Protect the Lives and Property of American Citizens; British Naval Authorities Expected to Take Similar Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai] US Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, Lieutenant General Badger, announced at a press conference yesterday morning that he is dispatching a Marine Corps contingent on a transport ship immediately to Shanghai to protect American lives and property, including the Shanghai Power Company. He said that the Marines would not live in onshore barracks but would remain on the transport ships, landing only when American lives and property are threatened. Badger explained that there was no intention of interfering in the Chinese civil war. He further stated that there are currently an estimated 2,500 American residents in Shanghai, all of whom can take refuge on warships moored in the Huangpu River along the Bund in the future.</p>
<p>Badger emphasized that the purpose of dispatching the Marine Corps is solely to meet the need for protection of American citizens in the event that the Chinese local authorities are unable to maintain public order in Shanghai. He stated that the US has obtained broad agreement from the Chinese authorities regarding this plan. Badger said, "We are closely monitoring the situation in China. If the circumstances require it, we will dispatch a considerable number of Marines to Shanghai to do our utmost to protect lives and, to the extent practicable, protect commerce, equipment, and essential American interests. We do not intend to replace local police with US troops, but will only use them in the event that the local authorities are unable to control the situation. He will do his best to reassure Chinese people that the United States has no intention of permanent activity. He said, "We are not here to participate in the Chinese civil war, but to protect Americans. It is clearly impossible to take responsibility for protecting all American property in Shanghai, but we believe we can protect important property. In the future, all Americans in Shanghai may be ordered to take refuge on warships. If the situation permits, they may be allowed to stay ashore to work during the day and return to the ships at night. Once the situation returns to normal, the Marine Corps will withdraw. He will also consider the needs of non-American Westerners, but they will not be allowed to take refuge on US ships. Badger estimated that there are enough merchant ships in the Nanjing-Shanghai area that can be mobilized in three or four hours to protect 18,000 people from danger. Badger declined to comment on the number of Marines who will be coming to Shanghai, but it is speculated that the main force of the Marines currently in Qingdao can arrive in Shanghai if necessary.</p>
<p>According to US Navy Commander in Shanghai, General Crawford, the US Navy has been in close contact with the British naval authorities, and it is expected that Britain's protection measures will be the same as the US plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai] US Western Pacific Fleet Commander Badger reiterated yesterday that the US military's deployment to Shanghai is not to participate in the Chinese civil war, but only to protect Americans and their businesses, and cannot replace the contribution of maintaining public order. Therefore, during the period when the situation is out of control, the only option is to relocate American citizens to the ships.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, all passenger trains on the Nanjing-Shanghai line coming from Nanjing to Shanghai, except for the Qiantang train which arrived in the city at 8:30 PM after being delayed for five hours, the remaining trains such as the 5th, 7th, and 15th express trains, as well as the fast train, had not arrived in Shanghai as of 10:30 PM late at night. It is reported that this was caused by the employees of the Xiaguan Station in Nanjing demanding the payment of family resettlement expenses and going on strike. (Note: a similar incident occurred on the 8th of this month).</p>
<h3>Passengers on Nanjing-Hangzhou Line Crowded, One Additional Passenger Train Added in Each Direction</h3>

<h3>Japanese War Criminal Itō Tadao Escorted from Tokyo to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Killed Our Citizens in Nanjing and Wuhu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese war criminal named Itō Tadao was escorted to Shanghai from Tokyo. The criminal was previously an army captain and killed American pilots in Taiwan. He has already been sentenced to 20 years in prison by the US 6th Army War Crimes Tribunal in Japan. Because he killed our citizens in the Wuhu and Nanjing areas during the war in China, our delegation to Japan negotiated with the US military authorities for his extradition. Yesterday, he was escorted to Shanghai by Major Qian Mingnian, a military attaché of the delegation. He was immediately handed over to the Garrison Headquarters and transferred to the Jiangwan War Criminals Prison for detention, where he will be tried by the Shanghai Military Court in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Not Preparing to Relocate South, Nor Does It Have Plans to Evacuate Personnel</h3>
<p>A reporter asked Xu Xueyu, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, about whether the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had plans to relocate south or evacuate personnel, due to recent rumors that transportation agencies were preparing to relocate south. Xu replied that the Ministry of Transportation had not given any instructions on this matter, and that with military and public transportation currently being busy, it was already difficult to keep up, and there was no spare time to consider relocating south. There are also no plans to prepare to evacuate personnel.</p>
<h3>Workers at Various China Textile Mills Request Four Months of Wages</h3>
<p>Workers from various factories under the China Textile Company, upon hearing that the company had recently issued evacuation fees of four months' salary to each employee, yesterday dispatched representatives to the head office to demand the same four months of wages, but were unsuccessful. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to request mediation. Deputy Director Zhao then telegraphed Director Zhang and others from the company to try to mediate. The company representatives firmly denied that there was such a thing as evacuation fees. What the employees received included two months of pre-borrowed year-end bonuses, one month for autumn bonuses, and one month for attendance bonuses. Deputy Director Zhao believed that the company's actions would affect other industries, and that the workers' demands could not be considered unreasonable. It was then decided on two points: (1) Workers should send representatives to attend the company's bilateral affairs meeting this morning. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau should ask Mayor Wu for instructions on how to handle the matter. The workers may send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau this afternoon to listen to the authorities' opinions.</p>

<h3>Equipment from China National Aviation Corporation Moves South, Employees Panic, Go On Hunger Strike to Protest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Employees of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) at Longhua Airport, because the company authorities recently moved important equipment south to Hong Kong, and have not yet made clear statements regarding the disposition of employees, were panicked and staged a hunger strike in protest at noon yesterday. A reporter interviewed the person in charge of the company yesterday, who said that the relocation of important equipment south was due to the contraction of business in North China, and in order to seek development in the South China and Nanyang regions, a base was established in Hong Kong, so a portion of the equipment was moved south, but it was not to withdraw the general headquarters from Shanghai. He also said that observing the situation, it seemed there was no need to withdraw at all, so the employees' panic was self-inflicted. The company authorities have absolutely no decision to disperse and lay off employees.</p>
<h3>Witnessing Abuses in the Rush to Exchange Gold and Silver, Platoon Leader Angrily Questions Bank Staff; Some Propose Adopting a Rationing Method for Those from Organizations and Groups</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The order of gold and silver exchange in the city has not improved, and according to witnesses, the Central Bank has seen corruption. According to Wang Qing, a platoon leader of the 9th Regiment of the military police, and soldiers Hu Jinlong and others, who were dispatched to maintain order at the Central Bank on the Bund on Sanma Road yesterday: When the bank started issuing application forms yesterday morning, not only were the first and third (or fourth) application forms taken away by bank staff, but a bank employee, about 30 years old, wearing a yellowish-brown suit, ran over and asked the issuer for one. Those guarding the gate also failed to do their duty, and it was discovered that one person forcibly pulled their child inside to collect an application form. Or, temporary permission was granted to scalpers who had already exchanged gold and silver to change their identity cards. Incidents like these were endless. Therefore, at 11:00 AM, the bank announced that it would stop issuing application forms, saying that 107 application forms had been issued. At that time, the crowd waiting outside swarmed in, and the order was greatly disrupted, but at this time, those who were truly lining up only received the 97th application form. At that time, platoon leader Wang Qing, out of righteous indignation, questioned the issuing staff, asking why the 100th application form had not been issued, but it had been announced that application forms up to the 107th had been issued? At that time, the bank employee stared blankly and did not know how to respond, only saying: they were only responsible for issuing application forms and did not care about the numbers. The situation inside is very intriguing.</p>
<p>Observing the exchange situation in recent days, it is clear that there are many abuses. In addition to creating a group of professional scalpers and creating opportunities for a small number of people to get rich, law-abiding members of society have basically no opportunity to exchange. It is heard that some people advocate adopting a rationing method for the exchange of gold and silver for organizations and groups, in order to remedy the shortcomings of the current method.</p>
<h3>Limit of Ten Taels of Gold Per Exchange of Deposits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the business of exchanging deposits for cash was changed to exchanging based on identity cards, the crowding situation has not improved. Also, there is no limit to the amount of gold that can be exchanged per application form, so when there are large exchange customers, the counting time is inevitably prolonged, affecting a large number of small exchange customers. In view of this, the Central Bank changed the method again yesterday, limiting each person to exchanging up to ten taels of gold each time, but not limiting the number of exchanges. The method for exchanging silver dollars remains the same. It is believed that after the change, gold can be supplied more widely than before, and the number of tokens issued can also be increased. The four banks of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank have all been operating according to the new method since yesterday.</p>
<p>Also, the Central Bank specifically announced yesterday that all those who hold application forms from the bank before the 9th must exchange them by the 9th.</p>
<h3>Crowds Also at Garrison Department</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since it was stipulated that military and police personnel must first apply at the Garrison Headquarters before exchanging gold and silver, it has been two days now. Because only 200 application permits are issued each day, and the number of military personnel who go to apply is always more than six or seven hundred, the area in front of the Garrison Headquarters is extremely crowded. Garrison Commander Chen Daqing also stipulated that from today onwards, anyone applying to exchange more than five taels of gold must not only have an identity document of an active military member and prove its legitimate use, but must also be personally received by Commander Chen for an individual conversation before permission can be granted.</p>
<h3>Robbery at a Western-Style Clothing Store in Western Shanghai – Two Perpetrators Apprehended on the Spot</h3>
<p>Accomplices Revealed to Be Soldiers</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Zhu Hongdeng, owner of Hongtai Western-Style Clothing Store at 736 Route Tenant de la Tour, Western Shanghai, reported that at approximately 9 PM the previous evening, four robbers suddenly appeared. Two of them were armed with guns. They herded the staff and apprentices onto the mezzanine, where one robber guarded them. The remaining robbers looted nine men's leather short coats, one Chinese-style black wool coat, two leopard-skin women's coats, one Chinese-style men's coat, and one cat-skin women's coat from the storefront display, totaling fourteen items, and fled with the stolen goods. At that time, the owner's wife, Zhu Chen, secretly slipped out the back door and telephoned the Jiangning Road Police Precinct to report the crime. Wang Xinheng, the Precinct Chief, immediately ordered Lin Deming, the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead Police Chief Hu Zhijie and police officers Zhang Yanxin, Wang Chenglong, Zhang Yulin, Yu Minglv, and others, to rush to the scene in patrol cars. They apprehended two robbers at the entrance and recovered the stolen goods. The other two robbers managed to escape. After interrogating the arrested robbers at the precinct, they identified themselves as Qian Yaotian and Zhang Daquan. They also revealed the names of their accomplices at large as Dai Jinsheng and Tang Zhiquan, both soldiers from a certain military organization.</p>
<h3>Extension of the Implementation Period for Regulations on Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses by One Year</h3>

The District Court received a formal order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday, along with the amended provisions, which increase the penalties for offenders.

<h3>First Exciting Soccer Match of the Season – Qingbai Shows Championship Form – Demonstrates Strength and Defeats Dongxing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] In the friendly soccer match organized by the Municipal Sports Reporters Association, Qingbai and Dongxing met at Yiyuan yesterday. The two teams were evenly matched and of equal strength. In an extremely tense situation, Qingbai won by a valuable one goal, defeating Dongxing. The first half ended with a score of 0-0, with no records for either side. The intensity of the competition and the quality of the performance were unprecedented this season. The stands at Yiyuan were filled with over 8,000 fans, creating an unprecedented scene. The referee was Shen Huichun, with Chen Jixiang and He Chunhui as linesmen.</p>
<p>Qingbai's 1-0 victory over Dongxing fully demonstrated their championship form. Twenty minutes after the start of the match, Qingbai began to gain the upper hand, but repeated attacks yielded no results. The situation in the second half remained under Qingbai's control, and Gao Baozheng finally scored a goal, securing the victory. Dongxing's prolonged attacks failed to penetrate, and their morale gradually declined, making it impossible to salvage the situation. In terms of defensive strength, the two sides were evenly matched, with Yan Shixin and Meng Yiliang for Qingbai, and Wu Qixiang and Zheng Bingyi for Dongxing. However, in terms of the agility of the forwards, Qingbai's Xiao Luo, Afu, and Baozheng, with the exception of Fei Chunhua who was slightly less impressive, plus Jin Lusheng, whose movements were wonderful, Dongxing had to admit their inferiority. Dongxing had more courage than wisdom, and lacked the ability to score in front of the goal. If it were not for Wu Qixiang in the rear, the number of goals conceded would have been more than just one. Qingbai's relentless attacks in the first half failed to produce results. In the second half, Gao Baozheng was moved to the front line, greatly enhancing the attacking force, demonstrating that the formation at the time was greatly related to the victory.</p>
<p>The match started at 3 PM, with Dongxing taking the kickoff. The two sides were evenly matched, and Dongxing's momentum was strong, attacking repeatedly, but without success. After about 20 minutes, Qingbai gradually gained the upper hand, but due to Qixiang's obstruction, they could only sigh in vain, and remained in a bitter struggle for more than half an hour, still with a score of 0-0. After the break, the players returned to the field, and Gao Baozheng was reassigned to the forward line, while Liu Tiyin was sidelined. Just two minutes after the restart, Xiao Fei advanced rapidly along the sideline and sent a long pass to the front of the goal. Gao Baozhi received the pass, creating an excellent opportunity. A ball that could have been scored soared into the sky. Seven minutes later, Qingbai advanced again. Xiao Luo got the ball and advanced straight along the left sideline. Jin Lusheng turned to the center to support him. Shi Dafa and Li Chengxian were both spun past in one move, and advanced to the goal line, sending a quick pass to the center. Qu Yongfu laid the ball off in front of the goal, and Gao Baozheng, waiting in the right position, headed the ball into the net. The clarity of the ball's path and the beauty of the pass were greatly admired by the 8,000 spectators. Qingbai opened the scoring first, and a storm raged in front of Dongxing's goal. Jin Lusheng launched another lob, but unfortunately Qu Yongfu did not manage to head it in. Qingbai's offensive was sharp, but it did not succeed. As time was running out, Shi Dafa was tackled by Yan Shixin, and won a free kick 30 yards outside the goal. The ball was sent high to the front of the goal, and Zhang Jiliang took advantage of the situation to swing at the ball. The ball hit the goalpost and bounced down, but did not enter the net. The failure to score this goal shattered Dongxing's hopes, and the victory and defeat were also a matter of luck and misfortune. The silver whistle blew for a long time, and Qingbai triumphed with a score of 1-0.</p>

<h3>Procedures for Endorsing Foreign Exchange Asset Transfer Certificates Under Study – Majority Advocates for Phased System to Avoid Market Impact</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of issuing Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates for the foreign exchange assets owned by the people and deposited with the Central Bank, relevant agencies have been conducting in-depth studies in recent days. According to sources from the financial authorities, the basic principles of the measures have already been determined. Currently, various parties are studying the timing and method of issuing the transfer certificates. According to the opinions put forward by various relevant parties, it is generally advocated that a phased system should still be adopted for the issuance of these transfer certificates, in order to avoid large-scale issuance and affecting market prices. However, importers and commercial firms hold a skeptical attitude towards this. They believe that it is difficult to say whether this decision by the government can ensure that the original owners do not suffer losses. They are all focusing their attention on the development of the situation and the relaxation of import review standards, as they believe that these two aspects will directly determine the price of transfer certificates in the future.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Fluctuates Upward, Fabric Market Optimistic About Price Increases</h3>
<p>The opening prices of cotton yarn are generally stable and attractive, but the customer demand is still narrow. Sales to Guangdong and Taiwan are slightly better, but there is little procurement by the processing industry. As for the fact that public utilities have increased prices by about 100%, it is related to the cost of cotton yarn. Therefore, holders are reluctant to sell at lower prices, and prices are fluctuating upward.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 12,500 yuan, and although it once rose to 12,800 yuan, it finally closed at 12,600 yuan, a slight increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as Baoguang and Jincheng also rose by 100 to 200 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 700 yuan, while 32-count Blue Phoenix and Yinyue each rose by 600 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at a high price of 11,000 yuan, and once fell to around 10,000 yuan, but finally closed at 10,400 yuan, a rise of 600 yuan. Also, the highest price for warehouse receipts approached the 10,000 yuan mark, and finally traded at 9,400 yuan, also up 400 yuan.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse rose from 9,200 yuan to 9,500 yuan, a rise of 600 yuan. Other coarse yarns of 16 counts and below also showed slight improvements.</p>
<p>The fabric market is flourishing, and the momentum of various fabrics is still good. After the opening, the number of customers reaching out was very large, and the local market's ability to replenish stocks was also strong. Furthermore, it was heard that the price of cotton yarn had risen, boosting morale, and prices rose steadily, ultimately closing firmly.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth rose from 375 yuan to 390 yuan, an increase of 28 yuan compared to the previous day. Medium-grade fine cloths such as Wufu and Laba Tong both finally traded at 350 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Biji opened in the morning at 390 yuan, and during the session rose to a high of 414 yuan, before closing slightly back at 408 yuan, a rise of 23 yuan. Jinyun Miaowu Yuan Biji rose by 20 yuan. As for Leifengta Yuan Biji, it remained unchanged from the previous day's opening price of 380 yuan. Sijunzi Zhigong Qie rose to 420 yuan, with little change in the goods opened by dyeing and weaving factories.</p>
<p>China Textile Corporation Opens Yarn</p>
<p>China Textile Corporation opened nearly nine types of yarn yesterday. Due to the large amount of capital flowing to the gold market, the number of yarns sold was very small, with only 46 pieces sold. The audited prices were: 20-count Jinyuanbao (excluding tax) 7,000 yuan, 6-count Fu Riguang 2,800 yuan, 8-count Riguang 4,350 yuan, 15-count Shuiyue 5,700 yuan, 32-count Shuanggu Fengnian 12,000 yuan, 40-count Youhong Baoguang 9,900 yuan, 42-count Shuanggu Hong Liuma 11,800 yuan, 40-count Sangu Hong Baoguang 12,500 yuan, and 60-count Riguang 15,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Flat and Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's artificial silk market showed a slight increase, but the trend was mediocre. The market intake and output were still scarce, and transactions were not active. 100-count Tianqiao opened at 9,500 yuan. In the middle, it was slightly soft and slightly firm. The market price rose and fell, and the market atmosphere was little turbulent. It closed at 9,600 yuan. After opening at 9,600 yuan, Dongyang was also due to the lack of actual sales, and retailers were waiting and watching, with no stimulation to morale. The market fluctuated for a long time, and then closed at 9,700 yuan, a rise of 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The export price of raw silk was unchanged yesterday. Foreign firms' purchases were small, and there were few transactions. Because the domestic sales price had not risen much in recent days, morale was good yesterday, and the market's buying interest turned stronger. The market price slowly rose. Grade 78 was traded at 13,000 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan. Excellent grade and ordinary grade also rose by 500 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk market continued to be weak yesterday, with more output than input in the market. The market trend was declining, and morale continued to be bearish. Both closing prices saw rises and falls. Huaqiang initially opened at 7,400 yuan, with average intake and output in the middle. Until the close, the performance was small at 200 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying interest turned slightly stronger, and customer sales showed slight intention to enter, with asking prices 300 yuan higher.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Fall – Few Buyers</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The foreign exchange transfer certificate market rose in a straight line due to the Central Bank's entrustment of other national banks to purchase large quantities, reaching a high of 50 yuan. Later, due to the large supply from Taiwanese exporters, amounting to more than 3 million US dollars, the supply temporarily exceeded the demand, and the market fell. Yesterday morning, the price fell from 48 yuan to 46 yuan at noon, and there were few buyers. According to the opinions of exporters, they hope that the Central Bank will actively support when the transfer certificate market falls sharply.</p>
<p>In other news, the Import Control Committee reported: From the 2nd to the 8th of this month, import licenses issued for goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange that had been paid for totaled 68,725.55 US dollars and 10,400 Hong Kong dollars. Including the previous issues, the total amount is 540,642.41 US dollars and 15,180 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<h3>Some Industrial Loans Applications Accepted</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The various preparatory works for industrial loans are now being actively carried out. The application forms for industrial loans were printed yesterday and applications have been accepted. The procedures stipulate that industry associations apply to the Central Bank, or that individual factories contact the commercial firms handling the loans. Application forms for order loans will be printed today and acceptance of applications can begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Credit Loosens, Cash Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's interbank lending rate in the city remained loose. The interbank overnight rate fluctuated between 20 yuan and 30 yuan per day, equivalent to 6 to 9 "jiao" per month, with most transactions closing at 7.5 "jiao." Both the supply and demand of funds were strong, but cash was still scarce. Firms in the industry also restricted withdrawals. Some limited withdrawals to 200 yuan. The reasons for this are said to be: (1) Cash is required to exchange for gold and silver. Those who exchange for gold and silver are trying to find cash, and after the Gold Yuan was withdrawn, cash became scarce. (2) Although the exchange rate in various places has fallen, Zhu Yiping and other traders are carrying large amounts of cash out of the country to seize the exchange rate, which is also a major reason for the shortage of cash.</p>
<h3>Amidst Falling Prices of All Goods, Export Materials Alone Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, while the prices of all goods in this city have fallen, the prices of export materials have risen instead. Shanghai tung oil has jumped from 600 yuan per dan to 850 yuan. Hankou has risen to 600 yuan, and Wanxian in Chongqing has risen to 450 yuan to 500 yuan. As for pig bristles, Shanghai's 40-pack box has also risen to 17,000 yuan per dan. It is reported that yesterday's New York pig bristle market saw good reports on various types of Chinese pig bristles, and domestic selling prices are universally expected to rise. According to industry insiders, the reasons for the rise are: (1) Although exporters have been selling off goods for cash and heading to Taiwan and Guangzhou, it is ultimately more stable and reliable to directly export goods to Guangzhou. (2) Due to the current situation, merchants going to the production areas to purchase goods have become more infrequent, resulting in a shortage of goods in this city and a depletion of inventories. (3) The selling price of foreign exchange transfer certificates has risen, increasing export profits significantly, and exporters are competing to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Applications for Import Last Week Decreased by One-Third</h3>
<p>According to the Import Control Committee, the number of applications for imports under the Central Bank's Foreign Currency Exchange Payment Measures last week (December 2 to 8) totaled 21, with a total amount of US$68,725.55 and HK$10,400, a decrease of one-third compared to the previous week's 30 applications, amounting to 92,768.67 yuan. Broken down by category, there were 9 applications for production equipment listed in Schedule 1, amounting to US$32,067.10 and HK$10,400; 6 applications for industrial raw materials listed in Schedule 2, amounting to US$17,896.80; and 18,761.65 US dollars for essential goods listed in Schedule 3A.</p>
<h3>Abundant Arrivals, Sluggish Sales: Rice Struggles to Recover, Flour Weakens, Cooking Oil Shows Strong Momentum</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals yesterday continued to flood the market, with 8699 shi and 5 dou arriving in both cities, including 4635 shi and 5 dou in the Southern City market and 4064 shi in the Northern City market. Market conditions rose slightly. Locally produced rice previously rose by 20 yuan, but due to sluggish consumption, prices lacked the momentum to rise. As a result, all grades of rice in both the Northern and Southern cities rose slightly by 5 yuan. In the Southern City, Bai Jing rice was 355 yuan, Bo Dao rice was 350 yuan, early rice was 330 yuan, and Yang Xian rice was 362 yuan. In the Northern City, Bai Jing rice was 360 yuan, Bo Dao rice was 340 yuan, early rice was 325 yuan, Yang Xian rice was 350 yuan, and Bai Yuan rice was 360 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Flour turned weak, sales were sluggish, and market sentiment was slack, leading to a consistent slight decline in prices. Bing Chuan flour opened at 127 yuan, closed at 129 yuan, down 3 yuan. Lao Che flour opened at 139 yuan, closed at 137 yuan, also down 4 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour all declined slightly by varying amounts of 3-4 yuan. Hong Feng flour was 126 yuan, Jian Cheng flour was 123 yuan, Di Qiu (Earth) flour was 130 yuan, and Deng Ta (Lighthouse) flour was 132 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of miscellaneous grains remained abundant, and sales were still brisk. Raw peanuts rose sharply, with Nanjing raw peanuts at 400 yuan, up 50 yuan from yesterday's market. Yangzhou raw peanuts approached the 600 yuan mark, trading at 570 yuan. Milk sesame continued to be strong, with Jiujiang milk sesame at 300 yuan, up another 3 yuan. Red sorghum also rose by 10 yuan, with Jiangyan red sorghum at 100 yuan. Yuan wheat and corn were flat, with supply and demand balanced. Local soybeans were purchased, leading to an upward trend in the market, with prices rising by more than 10 yuan. Hankou Za Dou beans were 155 yuan, and Pudong Du Dou beans were 195 yuan, up 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Cooking oil rose again, with very strong sales. Credit was easing in the industry, and prices rose across the board. Qingdao Ji Tong aged oil was 930 yuan, up 30 yuan. Jiangbei Ji Tong raw oil was 940 yuan, also up 30 yuan. The market for soybean oil from our own factory fluctuated, opening high at 890 yuan. The market then rose to 900 yuan, before falling back to 850 yuan, closing at 860 yuan, up slightly by 10 yuan from yesterday. Raw rapeseed oil was 770 yuan, opening at 760 yuan and closing up 60 yuan. Refined rapeseed oil rose by 30 yuan. Chongqing hot rapeseed oil was 620 yuan, and Ji Tong small cart oil was 920 yuan, up 20 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly, with Chang Zi cake at 77 yuan, up 1.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The sugar market was weak. Holders were watching the market and reluctant to sell. Although sales to customers had not improved, local demand was slightly better, but the overall trend remained weak. Apart from No. 4 and No. 5 Che Bai (white sugar) which rose slightly by 2-3, most other grades fell.</p>
<h3>Mediocre Tea Exports</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw sellers eager to sell, springing up like bamboo shoots after rain, but export of boxed tea was limited by the mediocre demand from exporters, making it difficult to raise prices further, and sellers struggled to maintain current levels. As for domestically sold flavored teas, sales from local areas and elsewhere remained steady, and market sentiment gradually strengthened, especially for lower-grade rough teas, which were in high demand, making the situation particularly vibrant.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Lingering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tung oil market tended to fluctuate again. Since the actual demand from all parties has narrowed, the industry has experienced a decline in business, so sellers, although they tried to raise prices due to scarce arrivals and inventory, ultimately felt unable to continue to raise prices. By the close of the market, prices remained unchanged. Full-weight Bai You (white oil) was 640 yuan per dan, genuine brand Xi Hong was 580 yuan per barrel, and the rest remained at the same level.</p>
<h3>US Aid Equipment Allotments Determined</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's US Aid Committee announced the allocations for the Industrial Replenishment Equipment Plan: (1) US$6 million for transportation and shipping replenishment equipment, (2) US$1 million for replenishment equipment for coal mines throughout the country, (3) US$500,000 for replenishment equipment for tin, tungsten, and antimony mines in central, southern, and southwestern China, and (4) US$5.25 million for other replenishment equipment, including public utilities and power companies. Those who were unable to apply for foreign exchange from the Transportation Control Commission in the past to purchase the necessary replenishment equipment can obtain some assistance here.</p>
<p>Allocation of Industrial Project Loans: 1. Coal Mines: Huainan Coal Mine in the Yangtze River Basin, US$3.5 million; Nanling Coal Mine in South China, US$750,000; various coal mines in central, southern, and Taiwan, US$750,000; Gaokeng Coal Mine in central and southern China, US$4 million.</p>
<p>2. Electricity: Shanghai Electric Power Company, US$5 million; Taiwan Electric Power Company, US$3.5 million (including the proposed Taiwan Fertilizer Company, US$1.5 million).</p>
<p>3. Fertilizer Plants: Taiwan Yimin Fertilizer Company, US$1.5 million (jointly operated by the National Resources Commission, the Bank of China, and Shenchang Foreign Firm); Taiwan Mulong Xinzhu Fertilizer Plant of the National Resources Commission, US$1 million; Nanjing Yongli Chemical Company, US$50,000.</p>
<p>4. Tin and Antimony Mines: Southwest, Central, and South China, US$2 million. The above-mentioned beneficiary units are now in the process of selecting and hiring design engineers to formulate plans, which will be reviewed and approved by the committee's consulting engineering company, White Company, before the Washington Economic Cooperation Administration can issue material purchase authorization.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Building materials are still in a downward trend, with bricks and tiles falling to the lowest possible price. Cement is still being sold off by small retailers, falling to 35 yuan per bag, and can be purchased for 30 yuan for larger quantities. Lime continues to fall by 10 yuan, opening at 70 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to frequent military transportation, lack of transportation vehicles has caused a large accumulation of inland shipments of feathers at the Nanjing Railway Station. As a result, exports here are still limited to previous inventories. Based on current new product prices, Tong Huo white feathers are 800 to 1000 yuan per Sima dan, and gray feathers are 700 to 800 yuan.</p>
<p>The timber market is sluggish. Yang Song (foreign pine) square logs sold to bridge builders are only 50 yuan per dan. Although the market price of Yang Song is still quoted at 3 yuan per foot, in reality, no one wants it even at 2.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The medicinal materials market is mostly flat and weak. New cargo Lou Pi (dried tangerine peel) from Haimen is quoted at 60 yuan. Good quality Yu Zhu (Solomon's Seal) is scarce. Guang Mu Xiang (radix Aucklandiae) and pepper have experienced reversals due to excessively large inverted port telegram prices. The Guang Bang (Guangdong merchant guild) is handling the situation, and market prices are gradually rising, returning to the market prices of the previous week.</p>

<h3>New Map of Refugees: A Quick Sketch of Winter Scenery in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] Years of war, coupled with the tension of the current Bengbu-Suxian battle, have inevitably shocked even this quiet and peaceful paradise. It is the middle of winter, when tung trees are sparse and old, and the gentle West Lake has also become desolate.</p>
<p>This is the shock brought by Nanjing and Shanghai, and also the rumors brought by Nanjing and Shanghai. The city railway station, this transportation hub, is crowded to the point of chaos, and the chaos turns into turmoil. Most of the people coming from Nanjing and Shanghai want to transfer to Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, and they try their best to take all their luggage. They consider themselves sixth-class refugees because first-class refugees fly to America, second-class go to Hong Kong, third-class go to Taiwan, fourth-class go to Guangzhou, fifth-class take boats to Taiwan or Guangzhou, and sixth-class take the land route to Guangzhou or inland. Since then, the people of Hangzhou have been watching batches of refugees and hearing pieces of "street news," which cannot but make people anxious.</p>
<p>Spreading Bedding in the Railway Station: Turning into a Temporary Dormitory</p>
<p>There are more and more refugees. Everyone wants to be comfortable, so they all want to take the sleeper cars on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. As a second-best choice, the reserved-seat first- and second-class cars are also fully packed. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is once again burdened with arduous tasks. It has just been repaired and is now encountering the second major disaster.</p>
<p>Later, someone rumored that you don't need a ticket to get on the trains in Nanjing and Shanghai, as long as you can squeeze in. Therefore, the passengers on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also boldly tried. As a result, trains are running irregularly, departing as soon as they arrive. It is a pity that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway had hoped to recover after the repairs, but that hope has now vanished.</p>
<p>There are not many train cars and the train frequency of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is also not high. As a result, many refugees spontaneously spread their bedding on the station, turning it into a temporary dormitory. Some people use their suitcases to form a boundary, some use ropes to create a boundary, and some even light stoves in the corners to cook meals.</p>
<p>Wandering Until Which Year? Fleeing to Where?</p>
<p>Many people think like this: "When the Yuan Dynasty invaded, Jiangnan was well-off for many years. It took a lot of effort to fight Nanjing in the Qing Dynasty, and Hangzhou is not a strategic location, so it is possible to stay here for a while." Under this idea, quite a few people have moved to Hangzhou to stay. However, people in Hangzhou have another idea: "Although Hangzhou is not a strategic location, it is still scary, so it is better to run to Shanghai, or to Jiangxi or inland." Under this idea, the number of Hangzhou residents fleeing to Shanghai and other inland areas is also gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have fled from Jiujiang and Nanchang in Jiangxi to Hangzhou, and they feel that it is not safe there either. Safety, safety, where is safe after all? It is truly "wandering until which year? fleeing to where!"</p>
<p>One Mu of Land on Yingshi Street: Demanding Fifteen Gold Bars</p>
<p>According to people from Nanjing and Shanghai, "Houses, land prices, and everything else in Nanjing are particularly cheap." However, Hangzhou does not have this phenomenon, and instead seems to be more expensive. One mu of land on Yingshi Street demands fifteen gold bars, and a small house also requires a key money payment (ding fei). The monthly rent is one shi of white rice. Various stores do not display cheap price signs but are instead 10-20% more expensive than in Shanghai. For example, ordinary velvet yarn sells for only 120 yuan per pound in Shanghai, but in Hangzhou, it sells for 160 yuan per pound.</p>
<p>Hotels and Teahouses Full: Singing Girls and Divine Maidens Popular</p>
<p>Hotels in Hangzhou have once again announced that they are full, with luggage piled up to the rafters. Several hotels on the lakefront can no longer accommodate any more guests, let alone the city railway station. Even teahouses have become temporary residences. However, several hotels in the inner West Lake, such as Xiling, Xin Xin, and Dielai, are not doing so well because today's travelers are not looking for any "pleasing and enjoyable things" but are here to flee. They want to be as close as possible to transportation hubs. In order to restore order to the station, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has designated passengers going to Shanghai to board at Changshanmen and passengers going to Jiangxi to board at Nanxingqiao. From now on, Nanxingqiao will again be a medium-sized refugee picture.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, cafes are becoming popular again. In the cafes, singing girls are singing decadent songs. "Sitting with an orange" costs hundreds of yuan at a time, and no one cares. Gambling has also been discovered. The "Nightingales" (divine maidens) on Yingshi Street also have patrons, and they no longer have to stand in the cold wind and rain like before.</p>
<p>Groups of Refugee Students: Seeking Food and Lodging in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Another scene is the refugee students. They come in groups of hundreds and thousands, and some haven't had food for several days. They came to Hangzhou thinking they could settle down, but they didn't know that the Hangzhou station was also chaotic. They have left their families and relatives and come to a foreign land, and their mood is quite bad, so many actions are inadvertently revealed. The Hangzhou Municipal Government is ultimately responsible for solving their food and lodging problems, but batches of refugee students leave and new ones keep coming, truly "wandering until which year? fleeing to where!"</p>
<h3>Military Instructor in Changzhou, Jiang Kewen, Shot While Collecting Rent</h3>
<p>Taken to Hospital, Life Extremely Endangered</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wujin, 7th] Jiang Kewen, a military instructor in the Xiaxi District of the county, abandoned his duties and led armed guards to the Maojiaqiao area of Lijiaqiao in the Qianhuang District to collect rent for Mao Huangen, a wealthy landlord with two to three hundred mu of fertile land. The Mao family is wealthy and used to run factories in Shanghai. Over the years, they entrusted Jiang Kewen with rent collection. His methods were cruel, refusing to implement the "25% rent reduction" and even using old scales to weigh grain, profiting from the difference. As a result, he had deep grudges. At 10:00 AM on the 7th, while passing through the junction area of Maojiaqiao and Wuxi, seven or eight thugs suddenly sprang out from the roadside bushes, blocked the road, and ordered Jiang to kneel down. Then, three or four shots were fired, and Jiang fell to the ground. One of the guards, "One-Eyed Dragon," was shot and killed on the spot. The thugs escaped immediately. Jiang was not dead yet and was taken to Wujin Hospital for treatment, but his life is in extreme danger.</p>
