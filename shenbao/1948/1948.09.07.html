<h3>商業銀行所有外匯　限明日前移存央行　總統明示違者予制裁</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕中央黨部六日上午九時舉行擴大總理紀念週，到國民黨籍之立。監委員等七百餘人，蔣總裁領導行禮後，卽席致詞，對政府最近改革幣制。管制經濟之經過以及今後本黨同志應如何同心一德，完成此一重大政策之使命，有詳盡之指示，茲誌其大意如后：</p>
<p>政府在八月中旬，鑒於經濟劇烈波動，物價繼被暴漲，認為國家巳進入緊急狀態，為適應全國人民之需要，乃頒布緊急措施命令，實行改革幣制，管制經濟，現在實行已經兩週了，由各地人民踴躍兌換金圓券之情形觀之，足證人民對於政府之信仰比之已往益加堅定，可知政府對於剿匪戡亂與國計民生有關的一切措施，只要能澈底執行，則人民沒有不竭誠擁護一致奉行的，這是最可欣慰的一件事。至於最近幣制與經濟實施的情形，截至上週末為止，全國各地所兌進的黃金。白銀及外幣和結匯證在內，總值約在四千五百萬美元以上。此外，國家三行兩局金庫移存中央銀行的外匯，共達一億一千六百萬美元，兩者共計總在一億六千萬美元，故金圓券發行的準備，今後益見充實。</p>
<p>但目前尙有一個問題，卽商業銀行對於政府法令尙存觀望態度，其所保留之黃金。白銀及外匯，仍未遵照政府的規定移存於中央銀行，並聞上海銀行公會理事會擬集合上海所有各行莊，凑集夫金一千萬元，賣給中央銀行，便算塞責了事。可知上海海銀行界領袖對國家。對政府和人民之禍福利害，仍如過去二三十年前，只愛金錢，木愛國家，只知自私，不知民生的腦筋毫沒改變。在共匪這樣猖獗，人民這樣痛苦，尤其是前方官兵這樣流血犧牲的時候，政府為要加强戡亂建國的力量，決心實行這一個黨大的改革，其成敗利鈍，實有關於國家民族的生死存亡，而若輩擁有鉅量金銀外匯的，尤其是幾家犬銀行，這種自私自利，藐視法令，岡知大義，眞令人痛心。這種行為固然是直接破壞政府戡亂國家的國策，而其間接實無異助長共匪的內亂，彼等旣不愛國家，而國家對彼等自亦無所姑息，故政府已責成上海負責當局，限其於本星期三以前令各大商業銀行將所有外匯自動向中央銀行登記存放，屆時如其再度與委蛇，觀望延宕或揑造假賬，不據實陳報存放，那政府只有依法處理，不得不採行進一步的措置予以嚴厲的制裁</p>
<p>這次幣制改革，我們最足自慰的，就是行政院長與財政及金融當局　劃周密，勇於負責，而且財政當局事先各種文稿都是親自抄繕，不敢假手於部屬，其精勤奉公，更為難得，不幸發布命令之前夕，關於停止交易所等營業的命令，蓋印不得不經過其秘書之手，因之洩瀚秘密，但此完全為其秘書的責任，而且其秘書有關人員皆已逮捕到案，政府自當依法嚴處，不料有幾家報紙借題發揮，對財部當局予以重大嚴厲的評擊，這件事情實已水落石出，對於財政部長毫無關係，我們不能以其用人不愼的微疵而加以重大的靑難，反來妨礙政府經濟政策的實施。</p>
<h3>官兵與公教待遇政府仍熟籌改善　俟增加收入有着落然後方能提高</h3>
<p>此外，尙有一點須加以說明的，就是全國官兵與公教人員的待遇問題，年來公教人員與官兵因法幣貶值，生活上備極艱苦，政府無時不在懷念之中。此次改革幣制，行政與財政當局原擬將公教人員待遇比現在所定的提高若干成，但一計算預算收支數字，又實在無法實施，因為這次幣制改革的成敗，其關鍵金在預算收支的數字能否得到比較的接近平衡而定，如果照現在所定薪水乏數，由四十一元到三百元的增加到百分之廿五（現為百分之廿），則全年就要增加支出一億五千萬金圓，若是增到百分之三十，則更要增加到三億金圓之鉅數，故這偶問題當時無法解決，但政府對此事仍在焦心苦思，熟籌如何增加這項收入，來達到提高公教人員待遇的目的，因為必須收人先有了着落，方能增加支出，纔不致再蹈過去法幣膨脹的覆轍。總之，這次幣制改革，必須先立新幣信用，乃可使物價臻於穩定，然後公教人員的待遇方能眞正改善與提高，但差可吿慰於諸位同志的，就是此次調整待遇，對於軍隊士兵的餉項巳快恢復到戰前的水準，對於公教人員薪津之基本數，由三十元提高到四十元，低級人員之生活，亦已獲得相當的滿足，我想，對於這一點，我們各位高級公教人員比之提高本身的待遇必更感快慰。</p>
<h3>勗勉推行勤儉節約</h3>
<p>總之任何國家在內亂外患革命建國期間，其政府尤其是革命黨員，必以「咬緊牙關，抽緊肚帶」自矢勉勵國人於艱苦環境之中自力更生，以盡到他復興建國的責任。會憶民國廿一年即九一八以後，我在武漢與江西剿匪，當時率領全體文武人員有兩句口號，就是要以「一個人做兩個人的事，兩個人吃一個人的飯」，今日我們當八年抗戰之後，繼之以奸匪叛亂生產停頓，經濟殘破，環境自更因難，本黨同志更應該「咬緊牙關，抽緊肚帶」，忍飢耐寒，茹苦飲痛，來作全國同胞的表率，方能號召全國同胞，共同一致來完成這一個戡亂建國艱鉅的使命，故本人以為，此次幣制改革，其意義不僅在經濟的改革，而關於政治與社會的影響，更為重大，但無論政治或社會改革的起點，葛過於「戒除浪費，崇尙節約」，因為「奢侈是亡國的禍胎，浪費為建國的大敵」，這個大敵如不能克服，則縱有各種優越的條件，仍不能完成戡亂建國的使命，故經濟改革之時，必須同時推行「勤儉運動」惟勤勞乃能增加生產，惟節約乃能减少消費，亦惟如此，乃能挽救今日中國社會貧窮的現象，希望各位同志都能一教倡導這一個運動，戒除奢侈浪費的頽風和苟旦因循的舊習，提高勤勞節儉和迅速確實的精神，領導民衆，改造社會，轉移風氣，達到吾人自力更生，雪恥圖强的目的。</p>
<h3>外匯申報登記與增資不相關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕總統昨（六日）在國民黨中央黨部紀念週致訓詞時，曾提及上海商業銀行界，旦有擬合湊一千萬外幣，存放中央銀行後，作為對政府之恩惠，實屬違反命令，令人痛心等語。茲探悉此事經過大略如下：政府旣決定令商業行莊增資至五十萬金圓後，上海有若干老牌銀行藉口原股東比例增資之困難，由金融業鉅子向財政當局磋商變通辦法。而此少數商業行莊，乃擁有大量外匯者，依法應將此種鉅額外匯申報登記，固與增資絕不相關。傳聞銀行界某巨頭曾向當局商懇，由若干銀行凑合美匯八百萬元，（聞當局有希望美雄一千五百萬元之說），繳存中央銀行以售得之金價作為股東之增資，並企圖因此而可保留被等所擁有其餘大量之外匯，不再申報。此顯係　反法令之事。大概總統或巳接獲關於此項商談之密報。</p>
<h3>平市各商業銀行願兌換金銀外幣</h3>
<p>張厲生返京尙有待</p>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕張厲生六日下午五時召集平市國家與商業銀行代表談話，勸即將所存黃金，外幣對國行兌換，會後張副院長吿記者，各該銀行代表皆表示願照規定辦理，惟顧慮兌換後政府是否追問來源，張氏吿以絕不追，即往念速自行提出所存數字，商同國行辦理。張氏又稱：外國銀行對改幣皆甚協力，匯豐等銀行每日皆往國行兌換外幣，七日再召集錢莊舉行同樣之勸吿談話會，張氏返京尙有待。王撫洲七日飛滬轉京，然後飛漢奔喪。</p>
<h3>各國營事業股票　均定九日發行十日上市</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕各國營事業發行股票事宜，財部六日上午召集有關各機關舉行會議，到交部航政司長李景璐，工商部商業司長鄧翰良及資委會代表等多人，由財次李儻主持，決定各國營事業股票均於九日發行，十日上市，發行前先將股票交中央銀行，再由央行委托中國。交通。農民三行銷售。京，滬·漢·穗·靑·渝·津等地同時發行，預定在一個半月內辦理完竣，股票分為一股，五股，十股，一百股，一千股五種。</p>
<h3>何應欽將飛平</h3>
<p>可能轉往東北一行</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕何應欽一二日內將飛平，作就任國防部長後首次視察，並可能往東北一行。官方透露：何氏出巡北方後，總統北巡之議將打消。</p>
<h3>發行準備監理會委員　應加入民意代表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕政府為改革幣制發行金圓券而設立之發行準備監理委會，監院監委認為該會委員人選尙欠超然，應參加民意機構代表在內。六日該院財政。糧政委會第二次會議中，巳決定提出斜正案。案由為「發行準備監理委會委員人選，僅有官方代表與上海金融界代表參加，以之代表全國性，殊欠合理，擬請政府合理改善，庶昭大信」。又公教人員按金圓支薪標準，擬請政府予以合理調整，以提高行政效率案，決議：推定委員五人，胡文輝，楊宗培，孫玉琳，王冠吾，段克昌，向政院財部進行調查，搜集足够之資料後，再決定提出糾正案事。</p>
<p>〔又電〕調整監院財糧委會，六日討論公教人員支薪標準問題時，曾引起熱烈之辯論，該會原擬即提糾正案，並附原則兩項：（一）請政府參酌當前物價情形，顧及公教人員實際生活需要，迅予合理調整。（二）俟財政情况好轉時，公教人員待遇應即恢復戰前標準。胡文暉，劉行之，孫玉琳等委員相繼發言，有主張即提糾正案者，有主張應暫緩提出先予調查者。末經決議，先予調查，並訪翁院長，王財長予以研討，再作最後決定。</p>
<h3>監院台灣巡察團定廿日左右啟程</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕監院合灣巡察國一行十人，巳決定於本月廿日左右啓程前往，在台期間預定一個月以上，至台省光復紀念日（十月廿五日）後返京。該團六”日曾開會，討論各項籌備事宜，此行最大目標為宣慰台省同胞，抵台後並即分頭進行各項調查巡察工作，六日會中並由台籍監委兵念台等簡單報吿台省最近政情甚詳。</p>
<h3>東北軍秣民食半年內可無虞</h3>
<p>衛立煌對戰局至樂觀</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽六日電〕衛立煌談戰局稱：六個月來，吾人己把匪逐出瀋陽外圍各據點，自三月至六月，此間國軍採用「以大吃小，以快吃慢」之戰術，消滅土匪卅五個營兵力；經濟方面，衛氏表示決心消滅黑市，安定物價。並稱：軍秣民食半年內可無處，不若外傳之嚴重。衛氏態度至為樂觀。</p>
<h3>總統電覆于斌關懷長春情況</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕日前东北九省三市立監委及國大代表于斌等五十餘人，以長春被國十有五月，陸空阻絕，糧荒嚴重，現已深秋，隆冬一到，在零下四十度之酷寒下，孑遣軍民，縱不餓死，亦必凍死，同感危機迫切，聯名呈請總統，請求集中空運力量，空投食糧，并作其他有效處置，情詞痛切。聞總統巳有覆電致于斌代表等謂：「諸君保鄕愛國，忠義熱忱，良用嘉佩，所陳意見，當積極進行，以解長春軍民之圍」。</p>
<h3>經合總署續撥款　我獲八百餘萬元</h3>

<h3>促進生產至上！</h3>
<p>在新經濟改革方案將頒布之前，我們曾說恢復信用第一：現在方案頒布以後，我們又要說促進生產至上了！</p>
<p>上海自經濟督導貝蔣經國氏施展鐵腕，加強經檢，取締居奇，撲滅黑市，未及一旬，物價下瀉，治標工作，可說確吿成功，此種不顧一切之作風，尤為勝利以來政府具有改革央心之初步表現，值得讚美。但經濟問題之最後解決，仍不得不有賴於合理的經濟措施，而政治威力祗能濟一時之急。所謂合理的經濟措施，其根本實不外乎努力增加生產而巳。</p>
<p>照常理說，現在各種生產事業，應劍及屨及，迎合目前利息降低工資穩定等等對生產有利因素的新氣象，以努力增產。但據企業界人士所表示，新發生的困難與故障，此起彼伏，不一而足，尙待政府與人民互相合作，切實解决。我們為供當局認眞注意問題的眞相起見，也顧不得什麼危言聳聽，只好具體的約略說出幾件來：</p>
<p>一，八月十九日之限價，並不能算得完全合理。因為是日以前，有些物品，售價甫經調整，施行未久者；也有些物價磋商調整，擬議日久而未及付諸實施，適逢明令凍結者。這在後一類的工商業，無異錯過機會，坐負損失，今後如生產愈多，則損失愈大，自不易激起其進取心。</p>
<p>二，八月十九日之美金結滙股書，其價為法幣七百八十至八十五萬元，加上掛牌外匯四十六萬元左右，兩共不過八百二三十萬元，而新定兌價，定為四金圓此一美元，實際巳增高至法幣一千二百萬元，是各工廠所需用外洋的原料，今後成本確巳漲起三分之一弱，而賣出成品責令其仍照限價，不許比例提高，則損失太大，當然不易維持其再生產，更談不到增產了。</p>
<p>三，有許多原料，現尙來自匪區或軍事地帶，其採辦時，自然談不到限價，加以搶購偸運，困難重重，其成本殊無從預計。如在銷區執定限價，不予合理的補償，則勢必令人裹足不前，而因减少採運，減少來源的結果，便有停工减產的危險。</p>
<p>四，各種捐稅費用，按照戰前標準，陸續調整的，巳時有所聞，其他增稅辦法尙在中央或地方擬議中的，尤不在少數。除此之外，還有糧種非公非私，亦公亦私的强攤義募，名目繁多，並不因限價而終止。轉嫁既失其效用，羊毛不脫於羊身，工商業的處境自比從前更為艱窘了。</p>
<p>五，從前的事業界，雖在通貨膨脹，萬分艱苦之中，亦不少特殊的辦法，或足補苴於萬一，如謀取低利貸款，充分積貯原料，爭取配額，套利周轉等等，皆是極明顯的事實。現在和率雖低，面貸款停做，限額减少，套利無從，不論原料眞製品，其存儲的數量與日期，又俱受到嚴格的限制。這在生產界看來，無疑地，都是不利的因素。六，從前各業產銷之間，價格有其自然的調節，無煩政府為之操心。而在政府普遍地實施限價之後，廠盤，批發價，與門售價之間，究應如何劃淸，各各相距若干，政府還沒有明文規定；又產地的進價，加上運銷各種開支及合法利潤，如何折成銷地的市價，政府也還沒有規定配合的辦法。以致成本雞合，廠家則不肯開貨，補進困難，門售又無利可沾，販運商人袖手觀望，中間商人更難活動。現在游資充斥，頭寸每每濫煞，而市面淸淡，大宗交易，迄未照常做開，其原因當在於此。這種局面，如果擯持下去，不予以積極的疎導，深恐工業無從發展，市面亦斷難期其繁榮。</p>
<p>以上各種情形，並不是我們杞人憂天，無病呻吟，更並不是說，修正限價後一切均可解决。但配合未盡合理，進行不能圓滑，却是事實。現在有關當局，似也已注意及此，正在着手各種積極的辦法，如中紡公司與招商局等的發行股票，物資機關的分別拋售等等。但我們以為還不够。最要緊的是：游資收了進去，能更進一步，使它轉變成為長期的工業資金，以供經濟建設的正當用途，而有助於生產的增加。否則左手回籠，右手為了純粹消耗的事情而依然放了出來，這對疏導游資固無大效，而與增加生產更無關係。須知能善為運用，游資卽是生產資金；不善運用，則原來生產資金恐反將逐漸變為游資。</p>
<p>至於拋售物資，以抑平物價，增加供應，這原是勝利以來一貫的政策。但要求抑平　效，則必須堅决做到幾點：（一）放棄收入第一主義，而改採平價政第。尤其是厲行限價的時候，其拋售的價格，必須寬留餘地，使買進的商人，可以獲得合法的開支與利潤，否則無法恪守其限價了。（二）數量要多，地點要散。單在上海一市實施拋售，其效用巳屬有限，而在上海更指定一處，零星門售，這只好說是一種象徵作用，徒然為黃牛黨」造機會，與抑平物價，恐怕無大關係。（三）假如所拋的是原料，或是半製品，最好與工業界密切聯繁，系統地予以分配，以求擴大其生產作用，並以示辦理之公開，而且手續必須迅捷，定價必須合理</p>
<p>以言內地的原料，如何使它源源外運，以與都市的製成品互相交流，這一點，尤其值得重視。否則如果名地名自為政，節節阻遏，國家經濟將退步到部落經濟。士貨運不出來，則農村將益形衰落，出口貨無從擴廣，都市的工業亦終於無法維持。等到工商停滯，物資匱乏，再要挽救，必更費力。經濟的事情不能專靠政治手段來解决的，而一切經濟管制，尤不可不統盤籌劃，全面推動。假使祗完全注重在消極方面，自然還是一時治標的辦法，就算做得萬分圓滿，能把倉庫裏現有的物資儘量地利用，而忽略了物資交流這一點，也未必就能達到增加生產的目的。所以我們願向當局進一解，促進生產至上！</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦六日電〕蘇聯政府六日正式宣佈：四强對義在非舊屬地之處置迄未獲協議。莫期科電合廣播塔斯社電訊第一次透露：四張對舊義屬地任何一部分均意見分歧。先是據報西方人士巳表示西方對義屬索瑪里蘭及伊利特利亞兩地之處置己獲協　，然對里比亞則否。英美法三國對蘇聯召開外長會議之建議，原則上當然無從特異議，然三國可望辯稱，時間未免太侷促。此間外次會議考慮殖民地問題巳有數週，並簽字於八月卅一日致各外長之報吿　上，報告書內容則祕而不宣。然西方國家間接暗示，雖僉知一般協議尙未獲致，然對東非屬地則巳有一協定。</p>
<h3>蘇聯控制東歐又一漏洞　波共走狄托路綫　秘書長被革職由總統自兼</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華沙六日電〕波蘭政府發言人六日稱：波蘭共產黨秘書長戈默卡免職己於五日起開始有効，惟戈氏仍繼任副總理兼收復區部長。政府公報宣稱，波蘭總統畢魯特已自兼共黨秘書長之職，再積極指揮黨務。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦六日電〕史達林之東歐秘書又顯出一個漏洞。華沙報吿稱，蘇聯與南斯拉夫共黨　虧不久，現又與波蘭共黨發生同一性質之不歡。據報，彼共秘書長戈默卡已因「國家共產傾向」而被革職，按狄托元帥之罪名與之相同。</p>
<p>以直率之言語解釋之，歐為戈氏與狄托相同拒絕忠價執行史達林路綫。戈氏失勢之另一理由，為波蘭日益恐懼蘇聯將剝奪波蘭在波茨坦會議中所取得之東德士地，蓋蘇聯旨在建設德國成為共產國家作為抗拒　西方帝國主義一之堡壘，波蘭之佔領東德士地，顯與此政策不合。英外部發言人稱，戈氏之免職為「又一種共產幻想之毀滅。戈氏在西方雖不著名，在共產情報局於一年前或立時，身為波共第一號，渠與新故之蘇聯要人日丹諾夫同為該局之主席。然該局於六月間集議開除狄托時，戈氏竟未出席，似當時渠似與狄托同被列為反對蘇聯土地集體化政策之「脫離將綫者」，而戈氏且特別反對蘇聯重建世敵德國之政策。多時來傳聞戈氏已失莫斯科之「歡心」。夏間據稱，戈氏因病休養，然蘇聯集團之新分裂巳不可掩蔽矣。英外部發言人又稱，共黨相信「共黨統治全球，全球即可安寗，」今由戈默卡事件觀之，其實大謬。渠稱，此不啻為對德國之當頭棒喝，蓋戈氏之得勢，係莫斯科所策動者。渠稱，如斯拉夫族之共黨亦不可靠，則其他國家可想而知，例如德國由共黨執政，其後　亦能預言。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林六日電〕暴動之共黨徒今日衝入柏林市政府，逼令市參議會在兩週中第四次取消會議，其後即自行集會辯論公開奪取市政府，而蘇佔區之德警察則封鎖市政大厦，不准任何人　開。佔領會塲後，暴衆即自行開會，討論冬賑辦法，並主張將全部柏林併入蘇佔區。市議會將於六日下午在英佔區舉行會議。暴動發生時，正值四强事軍總督似巳接近協定，以結束為期已有八十日之柏林封鎖。市嚴會曾命令壯士多人保護會議，然竟不能阻止共產羣衆。蘇方警察初尙佯作阻止暴衆，其後即袖手旁觀。代理市長費利頓堡後被召至蘇司令部，蘇方吿以將正式抗議市議會以壯漢守護市政廳。</p>

<h3>美國勞工日共和黨受抨擊</h3>
<p>勞工領袖民主黨行動一致</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕美勞工領袖及民主黨高級領袖，六日在勞工演說中，要求廢止塔虎脫。哈特萊勞工法案，幷將美國物價高漲歸咎於共和黨。一般預料杜魯門總統將借題發揮。美國有組織之勢工團體，由勞聯主席葛林及工業組織大會茂萊領導下，亦對塔虎脫。哈特萊勞工法加以攻擊。彼等要求三百萬會員將選舉日以全力擊敗每一個贊成新勞工法之議員。政府官員包括勞工部長吐屏，亦參加攻擊該法案，渠稱：塔虎脫。哈特萊勞工法，乃「不民主及非美者」幷「威脅在百年中勞資間關係，與工會安全，共和黨所控制之第八十屆議會分散勞工部幷「斷然拒絕對物價高漲採取有效行動」。勞工部副部長在明納蘇塔州杜爾脫斯城工會中演說稱：共和黨所擁護之勞工法，巳明白表現誰是勞工之友，誰是勞工之敵。共和黨並未看到彼等所走道路上之錯誤。共和黨在費城所採納之政綱中，對反勞工法一無緩和。農業部副部長勃爾納，在明州費勃爾脫城中演說時，指責共和黨企圖以諾言及無誠意之方法，造成農業與勞工間之不愉快。同時檢察官克拉克，亦參加勞工日之政治演說，以支持杜魯門在十一月中之該選對共和黨國會作嚴厲　評</p>

<h3>全國工聯大會召開年會　英政府運命所繫　克里浦斯籲請協力共渡難關</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕英國工聯大會之常年大會，包括英國各項勞工之代表者，明日將在瑪蓋特揭幕。大約將開會一星期之久，會中將討論許多問題，而尤注重藉僱主與　員之聯合行動以增高產量，鋼業之國營，工資與生活代價問題諸事項。其辯論對於政府之經濟政第似有極大關係。革國勞工所最不滿者之一，為政府不能遏制生活代價之步步增高，而工費凍結如故。英國勞工各界强詞稱，許多工業今年獲利較上年為豐，而工人並未沾有餘潤。按工聯大會包括一百八十八工聯，共有會員七百八十萬人，尙有女子一百二十餘萬人未為會員、</p>
<p>〔合衆社瑪蓋特五日電〕英國經濟獨裁者克里浦斯已被邀代表內閣演說英國處境之嚴重。克氏將於六日向大會發表演說，將籲請停止調整工資之要求，而謂政府得使英國渡過目前難關之唯一希望，繫於工人接受旨在壓低物價使工人有更大價值之工資，並非徒有物價再漲之不可避免結果之增加工資等政府長期計劃。克氏亦將籲請提高生產效率，渠如能克服叛離者，殆將獲得其事業上之最大成就。艾德禮政府亦承認，大會之決議如贊成一致增加工資之要求，則工黨政府之命運可能斷送。因此，克里浦斯實為和平使者。據預料勞工組職如反對克氏凍結工資與物價之經遙計劃，可能使選民於下屆普選時反對工黨，而確定保守黨之必操左券。</p>

<h3>公教人員待遇建議應予重訂　高參議員一提案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議員高叔安，為公教人員待遇太低，特向參會提案，請建議中央設法補救。其理由略以依照此次中央頒行整理財政及加強管制經濟辦法第十九條規定之文武公教人員待遇標準，原薪額三百元者，只可得金圓券九十二元，原薪額八百元者，只可得一百四十二元，而一般物價均比戰前高一倍至數倍，似此情形，公教人員何以自給。在前公務人員貪污舞弊以及工作效率低落，其原因大半在於待遇太低之故，今則待遇之低，仍復如故，而欲其淸廉自矢，工作邁進，其何可能。為使公教人員無饑寒之慮，而廓淸積弊起見，應請將該項待遇，重新酌訂云云。</p>

<h3>改編九至十二月份總預算　市府提送參會待大會公決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市卅七年度九至十二月份改編歲入歲出總預算，昨己由市政府提送市參議曾，以便提出第七次大會公決。該改編總預算特加說明，以查本市卅七年度總預算，原係按法幣教編列在案，茲以幣制業奉改革，本市總預算自應照合頒「整理財政及加強管制經濟辦法」第七條之規定，按金圓券改編本市卅七年度九至十二月份歲人歲出預算。</p>

<h3>秋風吹到古彭城</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　桑濬</p>
<p>〔本報徐州四日航訊〕秋風吹到徐州，九里山　古戰塲的景色更見　淸了。從山嶺西眺中原，極目無限，東望隴海，烟霧迷離，這壯愇而又莊嚴的山河，正維　着徐州市內六萬餘難胞的惆悵和懷念。去年化去四百億完成的祿州市內外城防工事，仍舊平靜地散佈在每一角落。兩月前的豫東大捷，使這些工事在四十五萬市民的心頭變成了裝飾。現在，棗莊的礦是毀了，賈汪還能日出二千餘噸煤，幣制是改革了，但物價問題還沒有澈底解決，這些，存在於市民們心底的比重是與剿匪進度保持着等量的。在街上，很少看到有人嚼山梨和山　糕，但每個人却都那麼貪婪地抽着「寳石牌」的土造烟，似乎胸際有無限　濕等待烘乾。</p>
<p>三平運動　劉經扶六月十四日在祿州上任，十五日就中原吿警，匪方發動廿餘萬的兵力指向中原，分明是要對這位「好好先生」先下毒手。但劉經扶巳不是前數年的劉經扶了，他巳懂得了整飭幹部，重用人材，匪方估計他在大規模會戰中所不能達成的任務，他這次終於在「人謀得臧」的條件下達成：黃百韜兵團超速的機動行軍，剿匪總部高級官佐們數日夜不眠不食，指揮調遣，宿將馮治安留守徐州，鎮定後方人心，他自己更每日乘機赴前綫上空，督戰三次。憑着這些條件換來的勝利，顯然是絕非俸致的。</p>
<p>接着，勝利後唯一最大的收擭出現了，那魷是所有戰鬥部隊士氣的增高。每一個慰勞團體來過中原，對着這一股健期而旺盛的士氣，沒有不在心頭浮起光明的遠景的。劉經扶當然也深知這種現象彌足珍貴，最近發起了一個「三平運動」，由總司令以迄士兵，待遇平等，生活平等，娛樂更是平等。現在前方的生活情調確實單純得近乎寂寥，城市裏沒有舞會，也沒有流行歌曲，漫天塵沙中，人民在操作，軍隊在操練。</p>
<p>將領笑了　現在，匪方正在黃河北岸召開檢討會議，他們承認了中原會載是他們致命的失敗，他們決定要報復。報復的日子大約是十月下旬，那時節正是秋高馬肥，報復的地點可能從泰安南下，許昌東進，目的還是在威脅江淮，震動京畿，報復的資本就是現在集結在魯西南及豫皖邊境的幾十個縱隊。國軍方面的佈署和對策怎樣呢？我們在一次集會上提出了這問題，剿總的將領們都笑了起來。他們的意思是：中原大捷以後，匪軍的實力和行動已瞭如指掌，針對這份實力，國軍的佈署是不會一刻懈弛的。那天晚上，剿總有一個歡迎晚會，開頭傾是一京音大鼓」皇后李硯雲的大鼓，她唱了一段「過河擋曹」，檀板輕敲中，她仿着諸葛亮的口吻喝道二「列位將軍，山人如今命你們去擋曹，干戈眞不小，須記着：要知彼知己纔算高！」幾位將領都同時回頭朝我一看，我也會意地笑了。</p>
<p>名將如雲　再看看徐州剿總劉經扶麾下，有李樹正，章毓金，馮嶷，軍政方面有胡佛，吳一舟，正可說左券在握。兵團方面有馮治安，杜聿明，黃百韜，邱淸泉，各方名將，風雨同舟，這些都是足以致勝的條件。這次中原慰勞團帶了一把摺扇贈給黃百韜，上面題着于謙的勗勸舊詩，黃看了以後很興舊他說：中原大戰，心力交瘁，但是後方同胞這次又賦予他以智慧，以啓示，他將對戰爭更沉毅，更勇敢。胡佛常常想念當年遠征軍時代的戰况，頗嫌幹政務不夠味，因此他立願重入行伍，一顯身手。面對着他們這種發自內心的熱忱眞令人感動。劉經扶軍前能有這樣勇於前進的將領，再加上他自己那股儉樸務實的熱勁，整個中原人民的期待是決不會落空的。據幾個被俘的匪方官佐說：自中原一戰，他們都不相信劉經扶是個「常敗將軍」，他們以為那是一個無聊的侮蔑。二千年前，劉豫州以豐沛起家，而今劉經扶又在古彭城負起「立功」大任，劉伯承與陳賡如在許昌樽前論將，恐怕也要以「英雄」之名加諸於這位劉使君的吧。　金風送爽的季節到了，後方也許正在期待着寒暑表的下降，可是在徐州，在中原，風雨如晦，你會覺得那種期待夠多麼的乏味！</p>

<p>〔本報濟南二日航訊〕自從幣制實行改革，旬日以來，在圍城濟南所表現的結果，已獲初步成功。在這期間，雖由於地當綏區，部份人民，惑於共匪的造謠破壞，難免懷疑觀望，亦有少數奸商，如銀樓。煤炭。難貨等業，不是藉口無貨拒賣，便是故意高抬物價，但經有關方面的多方解釋及嚴加管制後，人民對新幣的信心，巳迅即恢復，並由恢復而進入堅定，因此，一般說來，市塲各物，都能按八月十九日限價完成交易，中央銀行濟分行十日來所兌進的計有赤金八二點三八二兩，白銀三一〇九二點四一一兩，銀元二一八〇九元，美鈔四〇三點二〇元，比較說來，數目既不能算小，自亦正象徵着幣制改革的初步成果。</p>
<p>流言不攻自破</p>
<p>共匪為了破壤我新幣制，其最毒辣的一着，就是到處散播流言，說金圓券是大額法幣的別名，但經魯財政廳長尹文敬利用各種塲合運用各種方式，予以駁斥後，這種流言，已不攻自破。尹廳長說：「金圓券與法幣根本不同：法幣無準備，而金圓券有十足的準備，法幣無法定發行最高限額，而金圓券明白規定以二十億為最高限額，法幣對外無固定的匯率，而金圓券明白規定每四元等於美金一元，法幣的發行向不公開，而金圓券的準備與發行，立有嚴密公開的檢查制度，凡此皆足證明金圓券絕對不是大額法幣，散播這種無稽流言的人，不是因為識見淺薄，魷是別具用心。」</p>
<p>方搜購金銀</p>
<p>共匪為了破壤新幣制，其第二個陰謀是盡量提高金銀價格，大量收購我力金銀。新幣制實行後，政府將黃金定為每兩兌金圓券二百元，合法幣六億元，銀元每枚兌金圓券兩元，合法幣六百萬元，但共匪為了破壤我新幣，故意將黃金一兩，折合法幣十億，銀元一枚，折合法幣一千萬，並可無限制兌換。老百姓為了「利之所在」，都有不顧一切，向匪區偷運，魯省府為了中央既有每人自由携帶飾金二兩的規定，於新幣制實施時，自然不便阻止，但漸漸的由於外流日多，近來乃不得不變更辦法，在中央對「人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法」的補充條例未公佈前，只得暫行規定：即飾金亦不准携往匪區，但因遵守中央法令，只暫禁止</p>
<p>華懋公司出現</p>
<p>共匪為了破壞我新幣制，其第三陰謀是盡量將準備運入國軍區實物價格予以提高，藉以貶低法幣及金圓券信用及價格。共匪除原有之各地工商管理局外，近復增設一「華懋公司」，為負責出售匪區剩餘物資及查購國軍區渠所缺乏物資之專門機構。魯省府暨第二綏靖區經濟處為此特成立一「集中貨摥輸出輸入護運委員會」，凡輸出商擬運物品數量，運往地區，及換回何物，皆應事先覓具妥保由綏區經濟處核發許可證，再由稽查處查驗後始准護運放行，此其主要目的，乃在物資嚴重缺乏狀况下，嚴密管制後，可以達到「以物易物」「調劑供需」的目的。</p>
<p>亟頒補充辦法　欲求幣制改革全部成功，首須使幣值穩定，而欲求幣值穩定，最重要的應先做到物價穩定，而欲求物價穩定，在原則上，至少須做到：（一）消滅游資，（二）增加生產，（三）建立人民對金圓券的信心。因此，欲求幣值穩定，增加生產，換言之，即增加物資，亦為其重要條件之一。在綏靖區如濟南，所有重要物資，如糧食，如鹽，如油，如煤，如棉花，多來自匪區，自新幣制頒佈，物價被凍結在八月十九日限價後，物資來源日短，更加以共匪之管制或封鎖，致市內原剩少數物資，多有逃匿情形，即令管制得法，將來終亦必弄到因物資無來源而致「無物可營」，「有市無貨」。因此，即就純經濟的觀點言：濟南在這樣圍城之下，首先自必須開展軍事局面，而中央除了原來隨着改革幣制所公佈的四個法令外，為了適應綏靖區的特殊環境，亦應迅行公佈若干補充辦法，必須如此，新幣制才能更趨鞏固，而物價在綏靖區，始能維持長期穩定的局面。</p>

<h3>國家行局昨舉行會議　商討今後貸款方針　貸款對象決特別注重生產事業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行劉副總裁攻芸，於昨日午後四時，召集國家行局庫負責人開會，對今後之放款政策有所商討。經決定兩點如下：</p>

<h3>中紡股票十日後發行　由中交農等銀行代售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司，自決定於十一日起，改組為中國紡建股份有限公司後，新公司之股票，約可於十日後正式問世。</p>
<p>新公司資本總額八億元，提出三成二億四千萬元（合二百四十萬股）公開發售。</p>
<p>聞當局為獎勵民間投資，特將民股股息提高為一分，官股僅五厘。公司業務有盈餘，民股股息將優先分派。現該公司正趕印股票中，發售辦法，尙待政府批示。惟在證交未復業前，將由中交農等銀行代為發售云。</p>
<p>又訊：國營事業股票出售，除中紡外，尙有台糖，台紙，「招商局」，天津造紙廠等四單位，聞該單位等整理工作，亦將就緒，本週內發行。股數每張分一股五股十股五十股一百股等數種，每股一百元。</p>
<h3>中信局明日標賣　大批代售物資</h3>
<p>中央信託局代理出售政府物資委員會，上週配售人絲約三百七十箱，標售棉布約一萬五千疋，以及日用品雜貨等共價款七十四萬餘金圓。本週除人造絲照配外，星期三將同時標賣大批雜貨及日用品，並定星期四標賣棉布二萬疋。</p>
<h3>中農春繭繅工貸款　達四八萬餘圓</h3>
<p>頃由中國農民銀行獲悉：該行舉辦本年度春蘭繅工貸款，迄今共達金圓四十八萬一千七百八十八元零五分，計浙江省金圓一七九·一六〇。四四元，蘇州二一·四〇四。八八元，無錫二三五·一〇八·四五元，上海區計四六·一一四·二八元。</p>
<p>各地巳解交中農生絲，共計三三六三擔。計浙江一二七五擔，蘇州三五〇擔，無鍋一三六二擔，上海三七六擔。由該行交中信局收購者共一二〇〇擔。</p>
<p>又悉：繅工貸款額度，係根據當地物價指數，而由蠶絲產協導會審議核定為標準。計七月份上半個月，上海區每擔貸放一百六十餘元，其他地區每擔一百五十餘元。下半個月，上海區為二百廿餘元，其他地區二百一十餘元。八月份上半個月，上海計三百九十餘元，其他地區為三百八十餘元。</p>
<h3>進出口商籲請當局　迅發特上幣存單</h3>
<p>本市進出口同業公會等十六同業公會，為中信局收購無證自備外匯到埠貨品，應行付給原進口商廠之代價特種外幣存單，遲未發給，頃特聯合電請行政院·財部·輸管會·中央銀行·中央信託局等各有關當局，迅予核發。</p>
<h3>出口貸品限價表　勘誤及補遺項目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會昨日公佈之第三次出口貨品限價表中，稍有漏誤，茲經探悉其誤刋而應更正者如次：</p>
<p>重慶87號配鬃，應改為重慶27號配鬃。天津65號配鬃應改為天津55號配鬃。雄黃狼皮普通出口花色，每件二元六角美元，應改為二元七角。</p>
<p>其漏列應予補登者有：羽毛：鵝毛每磅美金四角八分，鴨毛每磅美金三角三分，鵝絨每磅美金一元八角五分，鴨絨每磅美金一元五角五分。</p>
<h3>毛茶產價激升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲據茶業權威人士稱：邇來安徽屯溪各產區之茶價，猛晋不巳，並聞彼地休寗茶業公會，連日均有電致此間有關公司，及棧號，略謂以屯市炒靑及烘靑兩檔毛茶激升，連匯水等每擔已達八十餘金元，但因貨為關係，買方尙有需要。惟本市茶商對此，深表關切，因際此各物平穩中，頗難遞升，同時以此複製外銷茶，難以配合出口，故目前同業間渴望產區價格，稍能抑低，俾不碍於產銷云。</p>
<p>昨日茶市：內銷茶進出互有，勢尙平穩，至於外銷花色，吐納談判未見暢順，續僅零星做開，而價格方面，各呈盤旋，無大軒輊。</p>
<h3>銀根尙穩　行局有差進</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根趨勢尙穩，四行兩局一庫於銀錢業票據交換中，合進一四八萬，其中中央銀行差進一〇七萬，中國銀行差進二十一萬，交通銀行差出三十八萬，農民銀行差出五萬，中信局差進四二萬，郵匯局差進七萬，中央合作金庫差進十四萬，商業行莊大交換差進一三七萬，小交換差出二八七萬，外商銀行合進二萬。</p>
<h3>同業定期存款　中央銀行決不恢復</h3>
<p>自金鎮外幣開始兌換後，市塲游資激增，銀錢業負責人，均盼中央銀行恢復同業定期存款，以减游資對市塲威脅。茲向中央銀行探悉：同業定存，己停止辦理，決不恢復。過去之舉辦，係基於體卹行莊之立場，對於吸收游資，截然為　事。目前法定利息，最高寫月息二分，此種低利游資決無興趣，如提高利息，又有介導漲價之嫌，且吸收游資，政府己另有辦法，故定存實無續辦必要。</p>
<h3>戶口米配價不變動　食米市勢平疲　高粳早薄稻均已有供應</h3>
<p>食米市勢轉疲，因戶口米價格決定不變，人心甚虛，且經濟管制嚴屬，貨主脫意頗濃，高貨粳米及早薄稻，均巳有供應。米店納胃不濃，因門市戶口米巳開始發售，故少向市上購取，去化呆木，價格雖仍站限價，但米質提高，供源甚暢，實際價格下降三五角，秈米降五角以上，糙秈米運袋十六元五角。昨日到貨南北二市，共計四七三一石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>挫跌，早開市勢最虛，因棧單出貨期限以昨日為止，貨主均欲脫售，且經濟管制綦嚴‘業外各物均降，致納戶甚少。兵船粉開市祗七元零五分，收市因浮貨去盡，故見略堅，為七元一角三分，下降一角之譜。老車粉低五分，下降較少，紅蜂，建成，及雄牌粉一致挫五分至一角。麩皮廠方未開，仍站限價。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市勢巳趨疲軟，因米價下跌，人心巳平，貨主供應驟增。黃豆價雖仍站限度，但供應巳多，車豆乍豆都有交易，苞米北帮納胃轉懈，價格下跌五角，茶豆做開不多，蠶豆，紅糧，均站原價，供應均多。元麥祇汕頭帮納取，市亦平定，芝蔴開出二百餘包，按限交易。生仁未有開出，因廣帮未納，未有成交。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>網續下降，因各糧俱跌，人心甚虛。又經濟管制甚嚴，貨主均有脫售之意，故供應殊多。大統豆油開市為五十元，收市退爲四九·五〇元。計降一元五角，生菜油四十五元，較低一元。生油站限價，但市亦轉虛，小車蔴油供應巳多。豆餅回籠貨已有售出，市勢巳懈</p>

<h3>助學籃球賽結束　回力大勝晨友　大公擊敗仁餘</h3>
<p>市教育局主辦之淸寒學生獎學金籃球義賽，昨為最後一日，又逢天雨，觀衆僅到四百餘人，門票收入金二百九十四元，三日共得金圓一千九百卅二元。昨賽兩塲：回力以六四比四一大勝晨友，大公則以五六對卅七擎潰仁餘。</p>
<p>晨友球　運奇劣</p>

<h3>烽火憶炞京</h3>
<p>— 朱蘭客</p>
<p>東坡說：「事如春夢了無痕」，前塵似夢，往事如烟，過去己成過去，記憶好像是多餘的。可是，人孰無情？我生長汴京將近十年之久，自然對它有着難以形容的愛戀。在這漫天烽火之中，想不到這個垂老的古城竟遭遇到歷史上空前的浩刦！從報紙上的記載與友人的來信中知道：昔日南關外幽美的故居，壯麗的省府及郵政大厦，巍峨的鼓棋與能廷古蹟，巿慶鱗次的相國寺，在這次兵焚之後，都變成了斷瓦類垣。千餘年來，碩果僅存的唐宋文物，都被無情的砲火所摧毁了。現在追憶起來，傷慈之餘，好像又在重溫兒時的舊夢，正如同破落子弟向人誇耀己經散失的名貴古董字畫一樣。也許別人譏爲痴人說夢，但是，正如陶庵夢憶自序裏說的「得是夢便好」，我要珍重這個靜靜的古老的夢……</p>
<p>論大小，開封城巿的面積遠不及南京的遼閥，也不如北平的偉大；其繁華及近代化的程度與上海天津漢口廣州等大都市比較，當然相形見細，就連最起碼的濟南也趕不上。至於歐化得出各的靑島哈爾濱更不用說了。可是開封也沒有這些歐化的大都巿裏的次殖民地的氣息，倒也許並非開封的不幸。住在開封城內，只覺得它樸實無華，古色古香，猶如小型的北平——比北平還靜。從中山大街一直到龍廷，從西大街一直到東大街，縱横十幾里路，即使是日中最熱鬧的時間，兩旁行人擁擠不堪，也覺得靜悄悄的，秩序井然。奔馳如飛的人力車夫，在揮汗如雨之時，還」忘不了向路人溫文有禮的招呼着「借光」。</p>
<p>開封的天氣，冬天比較南方冷些，但不像華北各地的酷寒·夏天雖然熱，但一到夜晚便很凉爽，沒有南京漢口等地夜間的悶熱。一年四季，春天特別短，秋天特別長。汴梁的秋天，是一段特別可愛的時間，每値秋高氣爽，雲淡風輕，騎　到近郊禹王台去看楓葉，或在高遠的秋空裏登龍廷鐵塔遠眺，北望黃河滾滾，在紛紛落葉中，可以領略到一種眞正的北國之秋，一種「胡笳互動，牧馬悲鳴一的肅殺景象。</p>
<p>最値得提起的，就是汴京民風的淳厚，上自達官巨賈，下至販夫走卒，都具有一種可愛的古樸氣息。譬如呌人力車講價時，每個車夫總是十二分謙恭的回答稱：「你老隨便給」。到任何店舖內去買東西，不論買不買，掌櫃以及夥計必先端茶讓坐，最後必以九十度鞠躬恭送顧客出門，較之上海大公司職員似理非理架子十足的派頭，眞是不可同日而語。記得兒時家中所雇用的聽差車夫老媽子，個個都勤勞忠實，一直八九年沒有換過，和上海現在家家「朝秦暮楚」的娘姨，眞不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>回憶過去任何一個地方，總忘不了吃的一項。開封又一邨的拔絲山藥，味純樓的酷溜黃河鯉魚，梁園的銬塡鴨，其滋味的鮮美，都是永遠使我不能忘記的。其他如鼓樓街馬元興的油鷄，都一處的蝦米白菜，尤令人懷念不置。這些當年常常留連的地方，現在恐怕都化爲灰燼了。</p>
<p>開封最容易使人發生思古之幽情的地方是相國寺。相國寺是複雜的，多角的，很像北平的天橋，從每一個角落裏，你可以讀到一部殘破不全的唐宋社會史。從說大鼓書的塲子裏與百戯雜陳的雜要中，可以看出一幕一慕沉痛的人生的悲劇。上次回汴，看見相國寺已零落不堪，龍廷多年失修，鐵塔曾被倭兵用砲擊毀一角，誰知四年之後，龍廷竟變成了舉國矚目的砲火之塲，相國寺也恐怕已夷成平地，大約只有鐵塔還邊立無恙吧？</p>
<p>惟一使人感覺討厭的，就是大街上的風沙。開封的風沙，好像比北平還要利害，每當外出，大風一起，一陣陣的灰沙，常會沒頭沒臉的蓋下，回到家裏，解開衣服一看，頭頸裏全是沙土。地上案頭，積滿了一二分厚的沙土是常事。</p>
<p>記得大宋宣和遺事專所描寫北宋徽欽二帝被擄北狩的一段文字，悽慘動人，不忍卒讀。接到友人來信，想不到開封在這次中原大戰中，人民傷亡之慘重，簡直又非北宋金人陷汴京時所能比擬，誠可以說是慘絕人寰的千古浩劫！這個衰老的古城是完了。當年風流薈萃之地，今日一片瓦礫之塲，大約只有厭人的風沙，依舊永遠不停的在這個破碎的古城上漫天的飛揚罷。（開封相國寺）</p>

<h3>賣書</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>今年不大買書，原因是書價貴而收入薄，每次想把留着的一些錢買一本曾經在書店看中的書時，總是被臨時需要的急用把這筆錢移作別用，於是只能把希望留到下次，而「下次」的機會往往也是這樣輕輕犧牲掉，使我把買書一事，列入奢望，不敢向書店去隨便躍躂了。</p>
<p>爲了買不起新書，於是想起自己一點舊書，假如賣掉了一部份舊書，不是可以去換幾本新書嗎？因此我想到了塵封在書桌一角的十二冊「老爺雜誌」。這十二册「老爺」，是前年冬季，外匯率還相當平穩的時候，我托書店直接向美國去定來的，能够保全到現在，其中還有一些小曲折。我留給書店裏的地址是自己的辦公所在地，每一期雜誌總是在每月的十六日左右可以收到，不大有很久的耽擱。但是當六月份的「老爺」收到以後，七月份便久久不來，反是八月份的一期倒在八月十七日收到了。我猜想多半遺失，否則怎有八月份的來了，七月份的倒姗姗來遲之理。</p>
<p>可是我總得努力查一下，假如查不到，只得去補購一本。我去託辦公所的收發那裏查詢，有許多外國雜讀寄來之後，是經由收發送到另一部門去作參考研究之用，我猜想這本雜誌也許混進了硏究室。這一種猜想果然不錯，查詢的結果，不出所料，果然在那邊，而且經過辦事人員拆封，翻閱，傳借，到底因爲沒有失主來認領，仍奪靜靜地躺在書架上。起初在查詢的時候，完全存的是緣木求魚的想法，現在居然求魚得魚，使整年的雜誌不致缺失，使我頗爲欣喜。</p>
<p>這一次賣書，首先便想到整年的十二册「老爺」。我想，還是把它賣掉了吧，換幾册新書來讀。對於這份心愛的雜誌在決定要出售的晚上，不免起了惜別的意思。我看過裏面每一幅漫畫，讀過每一篇短篇的文章，放棄掉而預備留着慢慢細讀的是幾篇較長的小說。這一個機會顯然是失掉了。還有這許多不厭再看的，無言的與有言的漫寶，以及彩繪的風情女人，此刻都要分別，不免黯然。不要說這些，便是單拿「老爺」雜誌裏的廣吿來當課本讀，就足可以供你欣賞揣摩。這些，到明天都要分別了，究竟和原來塵封在書桌一角有甚長的距離呀！</p>
<p>到下一天，我決定去賣掉，跑進舊書舖，老闆聽說是「老爺」，甚表歡迎，問我是幾年份的，回答他是一九四七年，十二本完全的。他說這樣吧，一共算三百萬，合金圓一元。</p>
<p>這數目使我在九月初逼炙的驕陽下打了一個寒噤。金圓一元！不能換一册新的「老爺」，就是連一本晚郵週報都不够買，如其想以之買一卅現代叢書，要是差得太遠了！</p>
<p>我只能把十二册書仍舊擱起來，不賣也罷，不是可以溫故而知新嗎？可是，讀新書的希望，又要順延下去了。</p>
<h3>美國預審制度</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>美國的審判程序向來是拖滯延緩，一件案子拖延經年才宣判是常事，有的案子甚至拖延了四年始經宣判。爲了改革這一弊端，華盛頓·波士頓·底德律等地的法院現在都採用一種預審制度，試行的結果成効甚著，各地的州法院亦紛紛倣效，設立預審法庭。</p>
<p>預審制度不侵犯個人的權利，却革除大部分的官樣文章，繁文褥節，和職業訟師的奸計花巧。預審這觀念於十九世紀起源於英國。於一九二九年由密哲甘州的巡迴法院的兩位法官介紹給美國司法界，在底德律城首先試行，結果良好。六年之後，波士頓也設立了預審法庭，結果同樣的美滿。</p>
<p>美國最高法院的大法官却爾斯·伊文司·休士對預審的試驗發生了興趣。在一九三八年，最高法院的一個委員會議決將所有的聯邦法院的程序規則現代化，並且授權聯邦法官自由設立預審法庭。預審制度就奠定了基礎。</p>
<p>每一個預審法庭的程序因法官的個性而稍有差異。以哥倫比亞特區（即美國首部華盛頓巿）法院的預審法庭爲例來說，是這樣的：</p>
<p>在正式開審之前兩星期，預審法官先將原被兩吿的律師傳來。開庭時，先聽取雙方同意之點，再聽取爭執之點。然後，法官將案情重述一遍，根據他的意見分析雙方的强弱之點。最後便是當庭調解，和解成立，一件案子也就解決了。</p>
<p>假如法官調解不成，他便記下一份預審筆錄，十上面記載雙方律師發言的要點。這份預審筆錄一且由律師認可，便成爲正式審判的根據。在正式審判的時候，對於在預審中雙方業經同意之點在何一方都不許再行爭辯，也不可以提出新的論點，除非法官認爲預審法官有錯誤不公的地方。如任何一方的律師業現了適當的新證據，法官通常總許他他提出。</p>
<p>這樣一來，正式開庭時案情已簡明得多了，宣判也不必再作無謂的拖延。</p>
<h3>不要憂愁</h3>
<p>— 斐宇</p>
<p>愁來無端，有許多人往往爲多愁而把自己的健康糟蹋了。但是只要我們能以冷靜的科學眼光來分析，憂愁實在是不該存在這世界上的。我們且看一個戰時兵上的關於憂愁的分析吧。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰的時候，英國有一對好朋友狄格和楊同時被征受訓。受訓終了，狄格先被調往歐洲大陸作戰。別後，狄格很樂觀地安於他的處境，而楊却整日愁眉不展，憂愁着戰死的危險。狄格在前線知道了就給他一封信，表面說：</p>
<p>「在你目前的情形之下，下面一件事中之一必定會發生：不是你被動員了就是你沒有被動員。要是你沒有被動員，你用不到發愁。要是你被動員了的話，那末下面一件事中之一必定會發生：不是你被調往後方就是你被調上前線。要是你被調往後方，用不到發愁。要是你被調上前線的話，那末下面二件事中之一必定會發生：不是你被處在安全地帶就是你處在危險地帶。要是你處在安全地帶，你用不到發愁。要是你是在危險地帶的話，那末下面二件事中之一必定會發生：不是你沒有受傷就是你受了傷了。要是你沒有受傷，你用不到發愁。要是你受了傷的話，那末下面二件事中之一必定會發生：不是你受了輕傷就是你受了重傷。要是你受了輕傷，你用不到發愁。要是你受了重傷的話，那末下面二件事中之一必定會發生：不是你被醫好了就是你死了。要是你被醫好了，你用不到發愁。要是你死了話，那末，你也不能發愁了！」</p>
<p>這封信被軍隊裏的通訊檢查員看到了，因爲它寫得很別緻，所以就照原文抄下了一份。第二天，一家報紙以一不要憂愁」的標題把它刊了出來。三四天後，這封信被譯作各國文字，報章雜誌用大號鉛字把它刊在第一版，電台都用它作廣播。於是一件公認爲分析心理最好的作品就這樣產生在一個無名小卒的手裏了。</p>

        <h1>1948.09.07</h1>
<h3>All Foreign Exchange Held by Commercial Banks Limited to Deposit with Central Bank by Tomorrow, President Explicitly States Violators Will Be Sanctioned</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Central Party Headquarters held an expanded memorial week for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Over 700 people, including members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan belonging to the Kuomintang, attended. After leading the ceremony, President Chiang gave a speech on the recent currency reform and economic controls implemented by the government, as well as detailed instructions on how party comrades should work together with one heart and one mind to complete this major policy. The main points are summarized below:</p>
<p>In mid-August, the government, recognizing the severe economic fluctuations and soaring prices, deemed the nation to be in a state of emergency. To meet the needs of the people, it promulgated emergency measures, implemented currency reform, and controlled the economy. It has been two weeks since the implementation. Judging from the enthusiasm with which people across the country are exchanging for gold yuan, it is clear that the people's faith in the government is stronger than ever. This demonstrates that as long as the government thoroughly implements all measures related to suppressing bandits, quelling the rebellion, and managing the national economy and people's livelihood, the people will wholeheartedly support and follow them. This is most gratifying. As for the recent currency and economic implementation, as of the end of last week, the total value of gold, silver, foreign currency, and foreign exchange settlement certificates exchanged throughout the country was more than US$45 million. In addition, the foreign exchange transferred from the national banks and bureaus to the central bank amounted to US$116 million, bringing the total to US$160 million. Therefore, the reserve for the issuance of gold yuan will be even more substantial in the future.</p>
<p>However, there is still one problem: commercial banks are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards government decrees. They have not yet complied with the government's regulations to deposit their gold, silver, and foreign exchange with the central bank. It is also rumored that the board of directors of the Shanghai Banking Association plans to gather all banks and financial institutions in Shanghai to raise 10 million yuan to sell to the central bank, considering it a perfunctory gesture. This shows that the leaders of the Shanghai banking community have not changed their mindset from two or thirty years ago, only loving money and not the country, only knowing selfishness and not the people's livelihood, disregarding the disasters that the nation, the government, and the people are facing. At a time when the communist bandits are so rampant, the people are suffering so much, and especially when the officers and soldiers at the front are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, the government is determined to implement this major reform in order to strengthen the power to suppress the rebellion and build the country. Its success or failure is truly related to the life and death of the nation. However, those who possess large amounts of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, especially several major banks, are so selfish, disregard laws, and lack a sense of righteousness. This is truly heartbreaking. This behavior is not only directly undermining the government's national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, but also indirectly aiding the communist bandits' internal rebellion. Since they do not love the country, the country will not tolerate them. Therefore, the government has instructed the responsible authorities in Shanghai to order all major commercial banks to register and deposit all their foreign exchange with the central bank by Wednesday of this week. If they continue to be evasive, wait and see, delay, or fabricate false accounts and fail to report and deposit truthfully, the government will have no choice but to handle the matter according to the law and take further measures to impose severe sanctions.</p>
<p>What is most gratifying about this currency reform is that the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the financial authorities planned meticulously and were courageous in taking responsibility. Moreover, the financial authorities personally transcribed all kinds of documents beforehand, not daring to delegate to subordinates. Their diligence and dedication are even more commendable. Unfortunately, on the eve of the announcement of the order, the order to suspend the operation of exchanges and other businesses had to be stamped by his secretary, resulting in a leak of secrets. However, this was entirely the responsibility of his secretary, and the secretary and related personnel have all been arrested. The government will certainly punish them severely according to the law. Unexpectedly, some newspapers took the opportunity to make a big issue out of it and severely criticized the financial authorities. This matter has already come to light, and it has nothing to do with the Minister of Finance. We cannot impose major accusations on him for his minor oversight in employing the wrong person and hinder the implementation of the government's economic policies.</p>
<h3>Government Continues to Deliberate on Improving the Treatment of Officers, Soldiers, and Public School Teachers, Raising Salaries Only After Increased Revenue is Secured</h3>
<p>In addition, there is one more point to be clarified, that is, the issue of the treatment of officers, soldiers, and public school teachers throughout the country. In recent years, public school teachers and officers and soldiers have suffered extreme hardship in their lives due to the depreciation of the legal tender. The government has never forgotten this. In this currency reform, the executive and financial authorities originally intended to increase the treatment of public school teachers by a certain percentage compared to the current level. However, after calculating the budget revenue and expenditure figures, it was simply impossible to implement. Because the key to the success or failure of this currency reform lies in whether the budget revenue and expenditure figures can be relatively close to balanced. If the current salary levels of 41 yuan to 300 yuan are increased by 25 percent (currently 20 percent), then the annual expenditure will increase by 150 million gold yuan. If it is increased to 30 percent, then it will increase to a huge amount of 300 million gold yuan. Therefore, this problem could not be solved at that time. However, the government is still anxiously thinking and carefully considering how to increase this revenue in order to achieve the goal of increasing the treatment of public school teachers. Because only after revenue is secured can expenditures be increased, so as to avoid repeating the past mistakes of legal tender inflation. In short, this currency reform must first establish the credibility of the new currency in order to stabilize prices, and then the treatment of public school teachers can be truly improved and increased. But what can be gratifying to all comrades is that this adjustment of treatment has almost restored the pay of army soldiers to pre-war levels, and the basic amount of salaries and wages for public school teachers has been increased from 30 yuan to 40 yuan. The lives of low-level personnel have also been adequately satisfied. I think that for this point, all of our senior public school teachers will feel more gratified than improving their own treatment.</p>
<h3>Encourage the Promotion of Diligence, Thrift, and Economy</h3>
<p>In short, during the period of internal strife, external troubles, revolution, and national construction in any country, its government, especially the revolutionary party members, must "grit their teeth and tighten their belts" to encourage the people to be self-reliant in difficult circumstances in order to fulfill their responsibility of revitalizing and building the country. Recalling the 21st year of the Republic of China, that is, after the September 18th Incident, when I was suppressing bandits in Wuhan and Jiangxi, I led all the civil and military personnel with two slogans, which were to "have one person do the work of two people, and have two people eat the food of one person." Today, after eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, followed by the rebellion of treacherous bandits, production stagnation, and economic devastation, the environment is even more difficult. Our party comrades should "grit their teeth and tighten their belts," endure hunger and cold, and endure suffering and pain to set an example for the people of the country, in order to mobilize the people of the country to jointly complete this arduous mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Therefore, I believe that the significance of this currency reform is not only in economic reform, but also has a greater impact on politics and society. However, the starting point of any political or social reform lies in "eliminating waste and advocating thrift," because "extravagance is the root of national subjugation, and waste is the great enemy of national construction." If this great enemy cannot be overcome, then even with all kinds of superior conditions, the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country cannot be completed. Therefore, during economic reform, we must simultaneously promote the "diligence and thrift movement." Only diligence can increase production, and only thrift can reduce consumption. Only in this way can we save China's current poverty. I hope that all comrades can advocate this movement, eliminate the decadent trend of extravagance and waste and the old habits of complacency and procrastination, promote the spirit of diligence, thrift, speed, and certainty, lead the people, transform society, change the atmosphere, and achieve our goal of self-reliance and seeking strength.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Declaration and Registration are Not Related to Capital Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] President mentioned yesterday (6th) in his address at the memorial week of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters, that the Shanghai banking community intended to raise ten million foreign currency units to deposit with the Central Bank as a favor to the government, which was a violation of orders and was regrettable. It has been learned that the details of this matter are roughly as follows: After the government decided to order commercial banks to increase their capital to 500,000 gold yuan, some old banks in Shanghai cited the difficulty of increasing capital in proportion to the original shareholders and consulted the financial authorities for alternative solutions. These few commercial banks, which possess large amounts of foreign exchange, should declare and register this huge amount of foreign exchange in accordance with the law, which is absolutely unrelated to the increase in capital. It is rumored that a certain tycoon in the banking community once asked the authorities to allow several banks to raise US$8 million (it is said that the authorities hoped for US$15 million) to deposit with the Central Bank, and the gold price obtained from the sale would be used as the shareholders' capital increase, and they attempted to retain the large amount of foreign exchange they possessed without further declaration. This is obviously an act of defying the law. It is likely that the President has received a secret report about this negotiation.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks in Beiping and Tianjin are Willing to Exchange Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>Zhang Lisheng's Return to Nanjing is Still Pending</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Zhang Lisheng convened representatives of national and commercial banks in Beiping and Tianjin at 5:00 PM on the 6th to persuade them to exchange their existing gold and foreign currency for national currency. After the meeting, Vice President Zhang told reporters that the representatives of the banks all expressed their willingness to comply with the regulations, but were concerned about whether the government would inquire about the source of the gold and foreign currency after the exchange. Zhang said that there would be no inquiry, and urged them to quickly submit the figures of their existing assets and consult with the national banks to handle the matter. Zhang also said that foreign banks are very cooperative with the currency reform. Banks such as HSBC exchange foreign currency with the national banks every day. He will convene a similar meeting with money houses on the 7th to persuade them. Zhang's return to Nanjing is still pending. Wang Fuzhou will fly to Shanghai on the 7th and then to Nanjing before flying to Wuhan to attend the funeral.</p>
<h3>Stocks of All State-Owned Enterprises Scheduled for Issuance on the 9th and Listing on the 10th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the issuance of stocks of state-owned enterprises, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of relevant agencies on the morning of the 6th, attended by Li Jinglu, Director of the Department of Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, Deng Hanliang, Director of the Department of Commerce of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and representatives of the National Resources Commission, etc., presided over by Vice Minister of Finance Li Tang.

<h3>He Yingqin Will Fly to Beiping</h3>
<p>Possible Trip to Northeast</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] He Yingqin will fly to Beiping within one or two days for his first inspection since taking office as Minister of National Defense, and may also travel to the Northeast.

<h3>Members of the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee Should Include Representatives of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Control Yuan's supervisory committee believes that the selection of members for the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee, which was established by the government for currency reform and the issuance of gold yuan, lacks impartiality and should include representatives from public opinion organizations. During the second meeting of the Finance and Grain Administration Committee of the Yuan on the 6th, it was decided to propose an amendment. The reason for the amendment is that "the selection of members for the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee only includes official representatives and representatives from the Shanghai financial community. It is unreasonable to represent the entire country in this way. It is proposed that the government make reasonable improvements to show great faith." In addition, regarding the standard for paying salaries to public school teachers in gold yuan, it is proposed that the government make reasonable adjustments to improve administrative efficiency. It was decided to appoint five committee members, Hu Wenhui, Yang Zongpei, Sun Yulin, Wang Guanwu, and Duan Kechang, to conduct investigations with the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, collect sufficient information, and then decide whether to propose a correction.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] During the adjustment of the Control Yuan's Finance and Grain Committee on the 6th, the issue of salary standards for public school teachers was discussed, which aroused heated debate. The committee originally intended to propose a correction immediately, with two principles attached: (1) The government should refer to the current price situation and take into account the actual living needs of public school teachers, and make reasonable adjustments as soon as possible. (2) When the financial situation improves, the treatment of public school teachers should be restored to pre-war standards immediately. Committee members Hu Wenhui, Liu Xingzhi, and Sun Yulin spoke successively, with some advocating for the immediate proposal of a correction, and others advocating for a postponement and investigation. No resolution was reached, and it was decided to conduct an investigation first, and to consult with President Weng and Finance Minister Wang for discussion before making a final decision.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Recently, Yu Bin and more than 50 members of the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and National Assembly representatives from the nine provinces and three cities of the Northeast submitted a joint petition to the President, stating that Changchun has been surrounded for 15 months, with land and air blocked, and there is a severe food shortage. Autumn has arrived, and the severe cold of minus 40 degrees in winter will inevitably lead to the starvation and freezing to death of soldiers and civilians. They felt an urgent crisis and jointly requested the President to concentrate air transport resources, airdrop food, and take other effective measures. The words were earnest. It is heard that the President has sent a reply telegram to Yu Bin and other representatives, saying: "All of you are loyal and enthusiastic in protecting your hometown and loving the country.

<h3>Zhang Qun Returned to Tokyo Yesterday and Will Meet with MacArthur Again Before Returning Home</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Zhang Qun returned to Tokyo on the morning of the 6th from Kyoto after touring major cities in the Kansai region for five days. According to sources close to Zhang, he will meet with MacArthur at least twice more before returning home this weekend. Zhang visited the Kansai region with Shang Zhen, Shao Yulin, and Lin Dingping last Wednesday, visiting Iwakuni, Hiroshima, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Lake Biwa, and Nara in five days. He attended several gatherings of overseas Chinese and held talks with the occupation authorities, the Japanese authorities, and Japanese business tycoons. Zhang has repeatedly stated that he is visiting Japan in a private capacity, but the occupation authorities and the Japanese side still believe that his visit is of great significance. Because Zhang has served as the Premier of the Executive Yuan and is an expert on Japanese issues, his suggestions to the government after returning home will have a significant impact on China's future policy toward Japan.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities, Coal, and Gasoline Maintain August 19th Prices, Economic Control Commission Orders Strengthened Anti-Smuggling Measures and Crackdown on Black Market Hong Kong Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao convened an ad hoc meeting of the Economic Control Commission at 4:30 PM on the 6th at the Premier's residence, attended by Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Wang Shijie, Chen Qitian, and Xu Baiyuan to exchange views on the current situation of implementing the financial and economic emergency decree and the financial and economic issues that should be addressed.

As a result of the exchange of views, the following points were decided: (1) Foreign exchange assets of all commercial banks should be deposited with the Central Bank in the short term. The Central Bank and the commercial banks will negotiate the implementation techniques, which must be implemented earnestly and conscientiously. (2) All public utilities are still not allowed to raise prices. Requests to adjust the prices of coal and gasoline are not approved and should still maintain the prices of August 19th. However, the price of gasoline for private cars may be reasonably adjusted to meet the meaning of cracking down on private cars. The prices of oil for military, public, and transportation businesses are not allowed to increase. (3) Strengthen anti-smuggling measures. Effective measures should be taken to crack down on black market Hong Kong exchange rates. The economic supervisors in Shanghai and Guangdong should be instructed to handle the matter conscientiously. During the meeting, Chen Qitian reported in detail on the methods for issuing stocks of state-owned enterprises, but no discussion was held.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Death of Feng Yuxiang? Qin Dechun Said It Seems "Hard to Believe", Soviet Ship Refused Turkish Inspection When Passing Through Straits</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Official sources here on the 6th maintained a reserved attitude towards the news of Feng Yuxiang's death by burning, but were apparently not particularly shocked by it. Qin Dechun, former subordinate of Feng Yuxiang and current Vice Minister of National Defense, said that the government was not particularly concerned about Feng's attempts to participate in the Communist rebellion. He also said that the circumstances of Feng's death by burning, as reported, apparently seemed "hard to believe." Another senior official, who did not want to be named, said: "TASS's report may be fabricated to make the people forget Feng."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th, United Press] The U.S. State Department declined to comment on Feng Yuxiang's death by burning. A State Department spokesman said that President Chiang had revoked Feng's government position in January of this year due to his disloyal behavior.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The main lead in the Tao Qiming case has shifted to Xu Baiqi. On the 6th, rumors circulated in the capital that other relevant personnel in the Ministry of Finance had left Beijing upon hearing the news. Our reporter specifically interviewed Finance Minister Wang Yunwu to inquire about this matter. Wang stated, "I am not aware of such a matter." The reporter asked, "To the best of Minister Wang's knowledge, are there no other personnel in the Ministry of Finance involved besides Xu Baiqi?" Wang replied, "That is correct." The reporter further inquired about his thoughts on the Xu Baiqi affair. Wang stated, "The matter has been handed over to the judicial authorities, who will handle it impartially. I have no further comments."</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] There has been a new development in the Tao Qiming case.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Production Promotion Above All!</h3>
<p>Before the announcement of the New Economic Reform Plan, we said that restoring credit was paramount. Now that the plan has been announced, we must say that promoting production is above all!</p>
<p>Since Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor of Shanghai, wielded an iron fist to strengthen economic inspections, crack down on hoarding, and eliminate the black market, prices have plummeted in less than ten days. This symptomatic treatment can be said to have been truly successful, and this uncompromising style is a preliminary manifestation of the government's determination to reform since the victory, which is worthy of praise. However, the ultimate solution to economic problems still depends on reasonable economic measures, and political power can only address immediate needs. The fundamental of reasonable economic measures is nothing more than striving to increase production.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, various production enterprises should now seize the new atmosphere of reduced interest rates and stable wages, which are conducive to production, and strive to increase production. However, according to business figures, new difficulties and problems are emerging one after another, and still require the cooperation of the government and the people to effectively resolve them. In order to draw the authorities' serious attention to the truth of the matter, we cannot help but specifically and roughly point out a few issues, even at the risk of sounding alarmist:</p>
<p>1.  The price limits imposed on August 19 cannot be considered entirely reasonable. This is because before that day, the prices of some goods had just been adjusted and implemented not long ago; some prices had been negotiated and adjusted, and had been under discussion for a long time but had not been implemented when the freezing order came into effect. For the latter category of industries, this is tantamount to missing an opportunity and suffering losses. The more they produce in the future, the greater the losses, and it will naturally be difficult to stimulate their initiative.</p>
<p>2.  The exchange rate for US dollars on August 19 was 7.8 to 8.5 million legal tender (fabi), plus approximately 460,000 yuan for listed foreign exchange, totaling only 8.2 to 8.3 million yuan. However, the newly set exchange rate is four gold yuan per US dollar, which is effectively increased to 12 million legal tender. This means that the cost of foreign raw materials required by factories has indeed risen by slightly less than one-third. However, they are required to sell finished products at the limited price, and are not allowed to increase the price proportionally. The losses are too great, and it will naturally be difficult to maintain their re-production, let alone increase production.</p>
<p>3.  Many raw materials still come from bandit areas or military zones. Naturally, price limits cannot be discussed when purchasing them, and the costs are impossible to predict due to rampant panic buying and smuggling, which are fraught with difficulties. If fixed price limits are enforced in the sales areas without reasonable compensation, people will inevitably be reluctant to move forward. As a result of reduced procurement and transportation, and reduced sources, there is a risk of work stoppages and production cuts.</p>
<p>4.  Various taxes and fees are being adjusted successively according to pre-war standards, and there are many other tax increase measures still under consideration by the central or local governments. In addition, there are various kinds of obligatory donations of grain seeds that are neither entirely public nor entirely private, which do not end with the price limits. Since passing on the costs is no longer effective, and the burden still falls on the shoulders of businesses, the situation for industries is even more difficult than before.</p>
<p>5.  In the past, even amid inflation and extreme hardship, businesses had special methods to make up for their losses, such as obtaining low-interest loans, fully stockpiling raw materials, competing for quotas, and arbitrage. These were all obvious facts. Now, although interest rates are low, lending has stopped, quotas have been reduced, and arbitrage is impossible. The quantity and date of storage of both raw materials and finished products are also subject to strict restrictions. In the eyes of the production sector, these are undoubtedly unfavorable factors.</p>
<p>6.  In the past, prices between production and sales in various industries had their natural adjustments, without the need for government intervention. However, after the government universally implemented price limits, it has not yet clearly stipulated how to demarcate factory prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices, or the distance between each. The government has also not stipulated corresponding measures for how to convert the purchase price in the producing area, plus various transportation and sales expenses and legal profits, into the market price in the sales area. As a result, costs do not match, factories are unwilling to release goods, replenishment is difficult, retailers have no profit to gain, and transportation merchants are standing idly by. The reason why there is an abundance of idle capital, and the situation of overabundance is frequently severe, while the market is sluggish and large transactions have not been conducted as usual, lies in this. If this situation persists without active guidance, it is feared that industry will not be able to develop, and the market will be difficult to prosper.</p>
<p>The above situations are not us worrying about the sky falling, or moaning without illness, nor are we saying that everything can be solved after revising the price limits. However, the fact is that the coordination is not completely reasonable and the implementation is not smooth. The relevant authorities seem to have noticed this and are working on various active measures, such as the issuance of shares by China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC) and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), and the separate sales of materials by materials agencies. However, we believe that this is not enough. The most important thing is that idle capital should be collected and further transformed into long-term industrial capital for the proper use of economic construction, which will help increase production. Otherwise, if the funds are withdrawn with the left hand and released again with the right hand for purely consumptive purposes, this will not be very effective in channeling idle capital, and it will have nothing to do with increasing production. It must be understood that if used well, idle capital is production capital; if not used well, the original production capital may gradually turn into idle capital.</p>
<p>As for selling materials to suppress prices and increase supply, this has been a consistent policy since the victory. However, to achieve effective suppression, it is necessary to resolutely achieve several points: (1) Abandon the principle of revenue first and adopt a flat-price policy. Especially when strictly enforcing price limits, the selling price must leave ample room so that merchants who buy in can obtain legitimate expenses and profits; otherwise, it will be impossible to adhere to the price limits. (2) The quantity should be large and the locations should be scattered. Implementing sales only in Shanghai has limited effect, and designating a place in Shanghai for retail sales is only a symbolic action, creating opportunities for scalpers, and probably has little to do with suppressing prices. (3) If the materials being sold are raw materials or semi-finished products, it is best to closely coordinate with the industrial sector and allocate them systematically to expand their production role and to show that the handling is open and the procedures must be swift and the pricing must be reasonable.</p>
<p>Regarding how to ensure the steady outflow of raw materials from the inland areas and the mutual exchange with manufactured goods in the cities, this point is particularly worth emphasizing. Otherwise, if each region acts independently and obstructs each other, the national economy will regress to a tribal economy. If the goods cannot be transported out, the rural areas will become more depressed, exports will not be able to expand, and the urban industries will eventually be unable to sustain themselves. When industry and commerce stagnate and materials are scarce, it will be more difficult to save the situation. Economic matters cannot be solved solely by political means, and all economic controls must be planned and promoted comprehensively. If only the negative aspects are focused on, it will naturally still be a temporary symptomatic treatment. Even if it is done perfectly and the existing materials in the warehouse are used as much as possible, neglecting the exchange of materials may not achieve the goal of increasing production. Therefore, we would like to offer the authorities a solution: production promotion above all!</p>

<h3>Our Government Is Making Concrete Efforts to Break the Impasse in Sino-Japanese Trade: Interview with the Head of the Trade Group of the Delegation to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Tang Jusheng, the head of the trade group of our delegation to Japan, said on the morning of the 6th that the Chinese government is currently making concrete efforts to break the impasse in Sino-Japanese trade. Tang returned here on the 4th of this month after consulting with the central authorities on the situation of Sino-Japanese trade for three months. He said that when the Chinese government revises its trade policy towards Japan, it is expected to relax the quota system as much as possible so that private traders can choose from a variety of import and export goods. Tang continued that improvements would also be sought regarding the accounting of private traders. Detailed measures are being drafted. Tang also revealed that Chinese government agencies, such as the Resources Commission and the Salt Administration, will also be approved to hold commercial consultations directly with the Allied Headquarters in the short term. However, contracts signed as a result of such consultations will still need to be signed by the China Trust Bureau (CTB), as it is the only agency handling state-run trade between China and Japan. In the past, the bureau had represented several state-run agencies in our country in conducting the above-mentioned negotiations. He continued that a representative from the Salt Administration would arrive here from China soon, while the Resources Commission already has a representative here. Tang continued that to date, private traders in our country have made about 50 sales proposals to the Allied Headquarters, but only 20 have been accepted by the Allied Headquarters. He then said that in order to speed up the processing of transactions, the trade group of our delegation has requested the Allied Headquarters to clear all 30 proposals submitted before September 1 that have not been resolved, solely through the exchange of memorandums between the Allied Headquarters and our delegation. According to the new regulations implemented since August 15, the procedure of exchanging memorandums alone is not complete, and contracts must also be signed by the Japanese Trade Agency. As a result, there are more bureaucratic procedures. Tang expressed his hope that the Allied Headquarters would agree to the request of the trade group of our delegation.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Officially Suggests to the United Kingdom, the United States and France to Convene a Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers to Discuss the Disposition of Former Italian Territories</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 5th that the Soviet Union has officially suggested to the United Kingdom, the United States and France to convene a meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers before September 15 to discuss the question of the former Italian colonies. The broadcast continued that the Soviet Ambassadors in the United Kingdom, the United States and France have submitted a note to the three governments on the 4th, saying: "The Soviet government considers it necessary to convene a meeting of the Four Powers' Foreign Ministers before the deadline of September 15 stipulated in the Italian Peace Treaty, to discuss the question of the former Italian colonies in the order stated in the treaty." The US Peace Treaty stipulates that unless the question of the colonies is resolved by the Four Powers before September 15, this question should be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for resolution. The representatives of the Foreign Ministers could not reach an agreement on the disposal of the Italian-African territories, so after months of meetings, the representatives of the Foreign Ministers submitted different reports to their respective governments on August 31. The contents of the reports are now kept secret, and it is rumored that the reason for this is that the United Kingdom is deeply afraid that the publication of the reports will cause a widespread movement among the indigenous people of the colonies. The major colonies that are difficult to resolve are Libya in North Africa, Italian Somaliland and Tripolitania. These areas are currently maintained by the United Kingdom until the fate of these areas is decided.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] The Soviet government officially announced on the 6th that the Four Powers have not yet reached an agreement on the disposition of Italy's former possessions in Africa. The Moscow Radio station broadcasted the TASS news report, revealing for the first time that the Four Powers disagreed on the disposition of any part of the old Italian territories. It was previously reported that Westerners had expressed that the West had reached an agreement on the disposal of Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, but not on Libya. The United Kingdom, the United States and France, of course, have no way to object to the Soviet Union's suggestion to convene a meeting of the Foreign Ministers in principle, but the three countries are expected to argue that the time is too short. This Foreign Ministers' meeting has been considering the colonial question for several weeks, and the report to the Foreign Ministers was signed on August 31, but the contents of the report were kept secret. However, Western countries indirectly implied that although it is generally known that an agreement has not yet been reached, an agreement has already been reached on the East African territories.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Controls Another Loophole in Eastern Europe: The Polish Communist Party Takes the Tito Route; The Secretary General is Removed from Office and the President Concurrently Holds the Post</h3>
<p>[United Press, Warsaw, 6th] A spokesman for the Polish government said on the 6th that the dismissal of Gomulka, Secretary General of the Polish Communist Party, became effective on the 5th, but Gomulka will continue to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Recovered Territories. The government gazette announced that Polish President Bierut has concurrently held the post of Secretary General of the Communist Party to actively direct party affairs.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] Another loophole in Stalin's Eastern European secretary has emerged. Warsaw reports that not long after the loss of the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav Communist Party, an unhappy event of the same nature has occurred with the Polish Communist Party. It is reported that the Secretary General of the Polish Communist Party, Gomulka, has been removed from office for "national communist tendencies," which is the same charge as Marshal Tito.</p>
<p>To explain it in plain language, it is because Gomulka, like Tito, refused to loyally implement Stalin's line. Another reason for Gomulka's downfall is Poland's growing fear that the Soviet Union will deprive Poland of the territory in East Germany that it acquired at the Potsdam Conference, because the Soviet Union aims to build Germany into a communist country as a fortress against Western imperialism. Poland's occupation of East German territory is obviously inconsistent with this policy. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said that Gomulka's dismissal was "another destruction of communist fantasies." Although Gomulka is not well-known in the West, he was the number one person in the Polish Communist Party when the Communist Information Bureau was established a year ago, and he was the chairman of the bureau with the newly deceased Soviet figure Zhdanov. However, Gomulka did not attend the bureau's meeting in June to expel Tito, and it seems that he and Tito were listed as "those who deviated from the line" for opposing the Soviet Union's policy of collectivization of land, and Gomulka especially opposed the Soviet Union's policy of rebuilding its old enemy Germany. For a long time, rumors have been circulating that Gomulka has lost Moscow's "favor." It was said in the summer that Gomulka was resting due to illness, but the new split in the Soviet bloc can no longer be concealed. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office also said that the Communist Party believes that "the Communist Party will rule the world, and the world will be peaceful," but the Gomulka incident shows that this is a big mistake. He said that this is nothing less than a head-on blow to Germany, because Gomulka's rise to power was planned by Moscow. He said that if the Slavic Communist Party is also unreliable, then other countries can be imagined. For example, if Germany is ruled by the Communist Party, its future can also be predicted.</p>

<p>[United Press, Berlin, 6th] Riotous communists broke into the Berlin City Hall today, forcing the City Council to cancel its meeting for the fourth time in two weeks. Afterwards, they held their own meeting to discuss openly seizing the city government, while the German police in the Soviet zone blockaded the City Hall, not allowing anyone to open it. After occupying the meeting place, the rioters held their own meeting to discuss winter relief measures and advocated incorporating the entire Berlin into the Soviet zone. The City Council will hold a meeting in the British zone in the afternoon of the 6th. When the riot occurred, the four military governors seemed to be close to an agreement to end the Berlin blockade, which had lasted for eighty days. The city council had ordered many strong men to protect the meeting, but they could not stop the communist masses. The Soviet police initially pretended to stop the rioters, but then stood by and watched. Acting Mayor Feilitenberg was later summoned to the Soviet headquarters, where the Soviet side told him that they would formally protest the City Council's guarding the City Hall with strong men.</p>

They have now been sent back to the American zone.</p>

<p>Labor Leaders Act in Concert with the Democratic Party</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] American labor leaders and senior Democratic leaders demanded the abolition of Taft-Hartley in Labor Day speeches on the 6th. The Harley Labor Act also blamed the Republican Party for the high prices in the United States. It is generally expected that President Truman will use this as an excuse to make a big fuss.

The Harley Labor Act was attacked. They asked the three million members to use all their strength on election day to defeat every congressman who supports the new labor law. Government officials, including Labor Secretary Tobine, also participated in the attack on the bill, which he called: Taft-Hartley. The Harley Labor Act is "undemocratic and un-American" and "threatens labor-management relations and union security in a century. The 80th Congress controlled by the Republican Party dispersed the Department of Labor and "flatly refused to take effective action against high prices." The Deputy Secretary of Labor said in a speech at the Congress of Industrial Organizations in Duluth, Minnesota: The labor law advocated by the Republican Party has clearly shown who is a friend of labor and who is an enemy of labor. The Republican Party has not seen the mistakes on the road they are taking. The Republican Party did not ease anything in the anti-labor law in the platform adopted in Philadelphia. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture勃爾納, in a speech in Faber, Minnesota, accused the Republican Party of attempting to create unpleasantness between agriculture and labor with promises and insincere methods. At the same time, Attorney Clark also participated in the Labor Day political speech to support Truman's severe criticism of the Republican Congress in the November election.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt Supports Truman's Election Campaign</h3>
<p>Severe Praise for the Republican Congress</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Mrs. Roosevelt has been silent on the Democratic election campaign. On the 4th, she wrote an article in her newspaper column, giving indirect support to Truman and Barkley. Mrs. It has been called a "thorough isolationist." The criticism of the achievements of the last Congress of the Republican Party is very severe. The article reads: President She Truman has made courageous efforts on the human rights bill. Although Stetson pointed out that President Truman should be responsible for high prices, I believe that Mr. Du has made various efforts in recent months to enlighten the people and suppress prices, which is better than those of Republican friends. I think that in terms of the six-body system, the Democratic Party can best protect the people's daily life and welfare.</p>
<h3>The US Wharf Strike Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 5th] The US Pacific Coast Wharf strike remained unresolved on the 5th. The 12,000 members of the Congress of Industrial Organizations' wharf attended the mandatory morning to reject the employer's final proposal.

<h3>The Splendor of the Coronation of the Dutch Queen in Arnold Cathedral, Crowds Cheering All the Way to Catch a Glimpse of Her Grace</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Amsterdam, 6th] Queen Juliana went to Arnold Cathedral for the coronation ceremony at 11:03 this morning. The people who cheered her were lined up all the way to the gate of the church. Although the weather was cloudy and there were raindrops from time to time, the crowd was still overcrowded. Some people even went out last night in order to find a better place to catch a glimpse of the new queen when she went to the church.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Amsterdam, 5th] Tonight, the whole city of Holland is illuminated by electric lights as if it were white. The canals surrounding the city center are like two giant pythons with clear lights, which can be regarded as a panoramic view. The people were rejoicing, filling the roads. Men, women and children formed groups, each wearing colorful paper hats, laughing, singing and dancing, and never stopping. The square in front of the palace was crowded with people, hoping to see the color of the new king, but Queen Juliana did not appear on the balcony, which was disappointing to the monarch. British Princess Margaret took a motorboat to swim in the canal and was very happy. The religious ceremony of the coronation is scheduled to be held tomorrow. Princess Margaret is the first official to go abroad to perform official duties and will attend the exemption ceremony as a special ambassador. In addition, European royal family members who have arrived here include Danish Prince Axel and Swedish Crown Prince Oscar.</p>
<h3>The National Federation of Trade Unions Holds its Annual Meeting, The Fate of the British Government is at Stake, Cripps Calls for Cooperation to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The annual meeting of the British Trade Union Congress, which includes representatives of various labor groups in Britain, will open in Margate tomorrow. It will be held for about a week, and many issues will be discussed, with particular emphasis on increasing production through joint action by employers and employees, the nationalization of the steel industry, wages and cost of living, and other matters. The debate seems to have a great relationship with the government's economic policy. One of the things that British workers are most dissatisfied with is that the government cannot curb the rising cost of living, while the labor cost freeze remains the same. British labor groups strongly claim that many industries have made more profits this year than last year, but workers have not enjoyed the benefits. The Trade Union Congress includes 188 trade unions, with a total of 7.8 million members, and more than 1.2 million women who are not members.</p>
<p>[United Press, Margate, 5th] The British economic dictator Cripps has been invited to represent the cabinet to speak about the seriousness of the British situation. Cripps will deliver a speech to the conference on the 6th, calling for a halt to requests for wage adjustments, and saying that the government's only hope of getting Britain through the current difficulties lies in workers accepting the government's long-term plan, which aims to lower prices so that workers have greater value in their wages, rather than increasing wages with the inevitable result of rising prices again. Cripps will also call for increased productivity, and he will probably achieve the greatest success in his career if he can overcome the dissenters. The Attlee government also admitted that if the conference's resolutions support the unanimous increase in wage demands, the fate of the Labor government may be sealed. Therefore, Cripps is a peace envoy. It is expected that if the labor organization opposes Cripps' plan to freeze wages and prices, it may cause voters to oppose the Labor Party in the next general election and ensure the Conservative Party's control.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative on the Allied Control Council Again Attacks Japanese Labor Law, Holds News Conference at Soviet Embassy in Japan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] The Soviet representative on the Allied Control Council for Japan, in order to expand propaganda against MacArthur and the new labor policy of the Japanese government, held a special press conference at the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo this afternoon. Soviet representative Derevyanko and his propaganda director Popov expressed their views at the press conference, attacking MacArthur and the Japanese government, saying: Regarding the issue of Japanese trade union rights, MacArthur and the Japanese government have violated the policies jointly adopted by the Allied countries and the Far Eastern Commission.撰波夫 mentioned that the British representative Shaw criticized this measure, the purpose of which is to suppress Japanese civil servants and clearly pointed out that the policy and measures implemented by the occupation forces and the Japanese government are destroying the Potsdam Declaration and the decision-making of the Far Eastern Commission. 撰波夫 believes that it is astonishing why the Japanese government still believes that the letter is an instruction when Allied Control Council Chairman Sheppard announced that MacArthur's letter was a suggestion. In conclusion, Popov pointed out that the Soviet representative's attitude in the Allied Control Council has remained unchanged, and announced that MacArthur should cancel his June 22 instruction to the Japanese government to amend the Civil Service Law, and that the Japanese government should abolish the Cabinet Order of July 31 and stop taking repressive measures against Japanese civil servants.</p>

<h3>All Confiscated Hoarded Goods to be Sold; Supply Retailers at Limited Prices; This Week's Focus of Economic Inspection Work is Cracking Down on Black Market Transactions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from the Economic Control Supervision Office: The city's economic inspection work is being actively carried out, and the central task this week is to crack down on black market transactions. Any transactions found to exceed the "August 19th" limited price will be severely punished. As for the hoarded goods seized in the past, such as paper, cloth, cigarettes, etc., the office has agreed to sell all the hoarded goods to retailers at the "August 19th" limited price to supply the market. A materials adjustment meeting will be held at 10:00 am today to conduct a comprehensive review of policies such as unblocking the sources of industrial raw materials in the future and selling off materials to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Since the inspection of warehouses, all materials that have been hoarded for more than three months and have been seized will be auctioned and sold off by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to suppress prices and punish unscrupulous merchants. Detailed methods are still under discussion.</p>
<p>More Than Six Hundred Tip-Off Letters Received</p>
<p>Since the Suppression and Construction Brigade began its service in this city a week ago, it has received more than six hundred tip-off letters. More than one hundred of them were of a serious nature and have been directly sent to Director Chen's office. The rest are accusations of small-scale hoarding cases and have been sent to the Municipal Police Bureau for handling. Among the tip-off letters, there are many anonymous letters. The Suppression and Construction Brigade hopes that all future tip-off letters will be signed to show responsibility. Furthermore, regarding the distribution of tip-off rewards, the original regulation stipulated that the informant would receive 35%, and the remaining 30% would go to the national treasury. However, due to objections from the Legislative Yuan, there may be changes in the future, so the distribution of this bonus has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Fish and Vegetables Increase Prices in Disguise</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the authorities posted notices and strictly enforced the "August 19th" limited price, the prices of fish, meat, and vegetables in the small vegetable market were once stable. However, as time went on, various vegetable market stall merchants secretly implemented disguised price increases, taking advantage of the fact that housewives are easily deceived. For example, meat shops would reduce the weight of meat sold or force customers to buy bones and skin along with the meat. Fish stalls would only offer dead fish and old shrimp at the limited price, without fresh fish and shrimp. Gradually, if one wanted to buy good quality pork and fresh fish and shrimp, one had to resort to the black market. Many vegetable vendors do not even know that there is a limited price. Green vegetables and edamame beans are sold for 250,000 to 300,000 per pound, with loud shouting every day. According to unofficial statistics, the average salaried family spends more than 50% of its total income on daily side dishes. Now that salaries are fixed, and the prices of vegetables and other items in the vegetable market cannot be stabilized, the consequences are unimaginable if this continues.</p>

<h3>No Source of Jewelry; Jewelry Stores Reluctant to Operate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the reopening of jewelry stores in this city, business has always been sporadic and has recently entered a state of having goods but no market.

However, the amount exchanged each morning is also very limited, with each person being allowed to exchange at most one mace (approx. 0.13 oz), and even having to queue up to purchase. Those who arrive late are told that they cannot exchange. According to the person in charge of the jewelry industry, the reason is that the source of jewelry has not yet been settled, and they can only exchange the jewelry that is exchanged in. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain business.</p>

<h3>Suggestion That the Salaries of Public School Teachers and Staff Should Be Revised; A Proposal by Councilor Gao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Municipal Councilor Gao Shu'an proposed to the Senate that the central government should find ways to remedy the low salaries of public school teachers and staff. His reasoning is as follows: According to Article 19 of the Central Government's regulations on reorganizing finances and strengthening economic control, the standard of treatment for civil and military public school teachers and staff is that those with an original salary of 300 yuan can only get 92 yuan in gold yuan, and those with an original salary of 800 yuan can only get 142 yuan. However, the general price level is one to several times higher than before the war. In this situation, how can public school teachers and staff support themselves? The reason for the previous corruption and inefficiency of civil servants was largely due to the low salaries. Now the low salaries remain the same, and it is impossible to expect them to be clean and honest and to advance in their work. In order to prevent public school teachers and staff from worrying about hunger and cold, and to eliminate accumulated malpractices, the said treatment should be reconsidered and revised.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] "Xiangshu" giant Xian Lin Legeng, Securities Exchange operator Du Weiping, and Li Guolan, the wife of Ministry of Finance Secretary Tao Qiming, and Yang Shuyuan, the wife of China Petroleum Company Secretary Xu Zhuanghuai, who sold Yongsha, were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the police on the 4th for violating the Exchange Law, and were taken into custody by the prosecutor on the same day after the court session began investigation, respectively. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law, and at 3:00 pm, the indictment and all case files were transferred to the District Court. The original text of the indictment is as follows:</p>
<h3>Original Text of the Indictment</h3>
<p>"It is found that Du Weiping is the person in charge of Hongxing Securities, and since August 16th of this year, he has been continuously engaged in off-exchange transactions, selling a large number of stocks. On August 16th, he sold 16 million shares of Yong'an Spinning Factory to Lin Legeng, on August 19th, 5 million shares to Yan Xianting, 4 million shares to Dong A'er, and 3 million shares to Zhenchang. He also used the name of Huamei Industrial Trading Company to trade in order to avoid attention. On the same day, Xu Yang Shuyuan and Tao Li Guoguan also sold 2 million shares of Yong'an Spinning Factory stocks in Huamei. All are off-exchange transactions, and Li Boqin, who is at large, presided over the matter, making huge profits. After a secret report from the Municipal Police Bureau, the relevant violations of the Exchange Law were investigated and transferred to the investigator at the beginning.</p>
<p>It is found that the above-mentioned criminal facts have been admitted by the defendant Du Weiping during the interrogation at the Municipal Police Bureau, and the circumstances are credible. The defendant Lin Legeng's confession at this office that the stock transaction only relied on verbal contact without accounts, and the defendants Tao Li Guolan and Xu Yang Shuyuan's confession that the stock was sold to Huamei without formal accounts at the time, only stating the transaction numbers, etc., it can be seen that the defendants did violate the provisions of the Exchange Law and were privately engaged in off-exchange transactions, which has been recognized. The defendant Du Weiting, Lin Legeng is responsible for Article 38, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, and Paragraph 3 of the Exchange Law, and the defendants Li Guolan and Yang Shuyuan are responsible for Article 53 of the same law. Apart from the fugitive offenders Yan Xianting, Zan A'er, and Li Boqin, who should be dealt with separately after they are apprehended, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>
<p>[Another Report] After the case was delivered to the District Court, it will be filed by the Criminal Records Section today, and the first hearing will be held within days.</p>

It is possible that the Siamese government may take actions to protect law-abiding Chinese, but this should not be viewed as anti-Chinese. The so-called anti-Chinese movement is actually rumors spread by unscrupulous elements with malicious intent.</p>

<h3>Vice President Chen and His Wife Arrive in Shanghai, All Circles to Host Tea Party Today to Welcome Them, Meeting with Reporters to Discuss Revitalizing the Moral Re-Armament Movement, Advocating the Practice of Four Standards to Overcome the Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Vice President Chen Lifu and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:10 PM on a Pan American flight. Over a hundred friends, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Jingguo, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Hong Lanyou, Wu Kaixian, and Li Ximou, went to Longhua Airport to welcome them. Although Mr. Chen was tired from the journey, he was in good spirits. After disembarking, he accepted flower offerings from Ms. Zhou Lingzhi and Ms. Gao Huizhen and shook hands happily with those who welcomed him. He then went directly to see his elder brother, Lian Guofu, who is ill. Vice President Chen stayed at the Chinese Farmers Bank Guest House yesterday. At 3:00 PM today, all circles in the city will hold a welcome meeting at the Lido Garden on Taixing Road, inviting Mr. Chen to attend and report on his overseas visit and impressions. It is understood that Mr. Chen will go to Nanjing soon to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting.</p>
<p>Promoting the Ideal of Universal Love and Great Harmony</p>
<p>During the meeting with reporters, Mr. Chen first reported on the achievements of the World Moral Re-Armament Conference. He stated that the representatives of the twenty-four countries participating in the conference unanimously agreed that the threat posed by materialism and totalitarianism to world civilization must be eliminated, and they deeply felt that to meet the need, it was necessary to establish a positive theory to confront them. The central idea of this theory is based on the fact that the biggest shortcomings of materialist totalitarianism are moral decline and the starting point of hatred and hypocrisy. These shortcomings must be remedied from the root, so it is advocated to practice honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love, the four standards, to overcome this crisis, and to start with the self-efforts of each individual, extending to the relationship between families and countries, which is in line with the Chinese ancient saying "cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the country, and pacify the world," a political philosophy that advocates breaking religious, racial discrimination, labor-capital conflicts, etc., and promote the ideal of true universal love and great harmony.</p>
<p>Domestic Promotion Still Needs Planning</p>
<p>All parties in the United States attached great importance to the conference. Mr. Hoffman, the executor of the foreign aid bill, sent a telegram to the conference saying that this movement is a parallel part of the spirit of the Marshall Plan. Speaker Martin believed that this movement is an important turning point in history and hopes that it will be promoted jointly by all sectors of society. Currently, this movement has been widely launched around the world. More than 1,500 people have gathered at the training centers in Caux, Switzerland, and Mackinac Island and Ojai, USA. Mr. Chen was invited to give speeches, and the most effective results were in Scandinavia and Western European countries, especially in the American coal mining area. How to promote this movement in China still needs concrete planning.</p>
<p>More Than Seventy Formal Speeches</p>
<p>After the conference, Mr. Chen visited the democratic advanced countries of England, France, and Switzerland to investigate party politics. He said that the national conditions of each country are different, so the application of party politics is also different. There are many that can be used as a reference for the advancement of constitutional government in our country, and he will contribute them to all parties for reference.</p>
<p>During the three months in the United States, Mr. Chen gave no less than seventy formal speeches during his travels in various countries. He worked for more than ten hours a day, which shows the intensity of his life. These speeches were often held at the invitation of various groups and overseas Chinese. Mr. Chen also said that he had reported the domestic situation to overseas Chinese and government officials and people from all walks of life in various countries in detail. The enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for the motherland was moving.</p>

<h3>Autumn Wind Blows to Ancient Pengcheng</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter, Sang Jun</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th (airmail)] The autumn wind blows to Xuzhou, and the scenery of the ancient battlefield of Jiuli Mountain is even clearer. Looking west from the mountain ridge to the Central Plains, the horizon is endless. Looking east to the Longhai Railway, the smoke and fog are hazy. This magnificent and solemn landscape is precisely where the more than 60,000 refugees in Xuzhou City place their melancholy and memories. The city defense works inside and outside Luozhou City, completed last year at a cost of 40 billion yuan, are still quietly scattered in every corner. The victory in eastern Henan two months ago turned these fortifications into decorations in the hearts of the 450,000 citizens. Now, the mines in Zaozhuang have been destroyed. The Jiawang mines can still produce more than 2,000 tons of coal per day. The currency system has been reformed, but the problem of commodity prices has not been completely resolved. The weight of these things in the hearts of citizens is directly proportional to the progress of bandit suppression. On the street, few people are seen chewing wild pears and hawthorn cakes, but everyone is so greedily smoking "Gem" brand locally made cigarettes, as if there is endless dampness in their chests waiting to be dried.</p>
<p>Three Equalizations Movement</p>
<p>Liu Jingfu took office in Luozhou on June 14. On the 15th, a warning came from the Central Plains that bandits had launched more than 200,000 troops towards the Central Plains, clearly intending to strike first at this "Mr. Nice Guy." But Liu Jingfu is no longer the Liu Jingfu of the previous few years. He has learned to rectify cadres and reuse talent. What the bandits estimated he could not accomplish in a large-scale battle, he finally achieved this time under the condition of "good planning by people": Huang Baitao's corps moved at an accelerated pace, senior officers of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters directed and dispatched for days and nights without sleep or food, veteran Feng Zhi'an stayed behind in Xuzhou, stabilizing the morale of the rear, and he himself took a plane to the front line three times a day to supervise the battle. The victory exchanged for these conditions is clearly not achieved by chance.</p>
<p>Next, the only biggest gain after the victory appeared, which was the increase in the morale of all combat troops. Every comfort group that came to the Central Plains, facing this healthy and vigorous morale, could not help but have bright prospects emerge in their hearts. Of course, Liu Jingfu also knew that this phenomenon was extremely precious. Recently, he launched a "Three Equalizations Movement," in which everyone from the commander-in-chief to the soldiers is treated equally, lives equally, and enjoys entertainment equally. Now the life style in the front is indeed so simple that it is almost lonely. There are no dances or pop songs in the city. In the sky-filled dust, the people are working and the troops are training.</p>
<p>Generals Smiled</p>
<p>Now, the bandits are holding a review meeting on the north bank of the Yellow River. They admit that the Central Plains campaign was their fatal failure, and they have decided to retaliate. The date of retaliation is likely to be in late October, which is the season of high autumn and fat horses. The location of the retaliation may be from Taian south, Xuchang east, the purpose is still to threaten the Huai River and shake the capital. The capital for the retaliation is the dozens of columns now gathered in southwestern Shandong and the border between Henan and Anhui. What is the deployment and countermeasure on the part of the National Army? We raised this question at a gathering, and the generals of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters all laughed. What they meant was: After the victory in the Central Plains, the strength and actions of the bandit army have been understood thoroughly. In response to this strength, the deployment of the National Army will not be slack for a moment. That night, there was a welcome party at the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. The opening was a Beijing-style drum by "Queen" Li Yunyun. She sang a section of "Guohe Dang Cao," and as the sandalwood clappers tapped lightly, she imitated Zhuge Liang's tone and shouted, "Generals, I now order you to resist Cao! The war is no small matter, remember: knowing yourself and your enemy is the best!" Several generals turned back at the same time to look at me, and I smiled understandingly.</p>
<p>Famous Generals Like Clouds</p>
<p>Looking again at Liu Jingfu's Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Headquarters, there are Li Shuzheng, Zhang Yujin, Feng Yi, and on the military and political front, there are Hu Fo and Wu Yizhou. It can be said that victory is assured. On the corps side, there are Feng Zhi'an, Du Yuming, Huang Baitao, and Qiu Qingquan, all famous generals who are in the same boat through thick and thin. These are all conditions sufficient for victory. This time, the Central Plains Comfort Group presented Huang Baitao with a folding fan inscribed with Yu Qian's exhortation poem. Huang looked at it and said with great enthusiasm: In the Central Plains War, his mind and body were exhausted, but the compatriots in the rear have now given him wisdom and inspiration. He will be more determined and brave in the war. Hu Fo often thinks of the battles of the expeditionary force era and feels that doing government affairs is not enough to his liking. Therefore, he vowed to rejoin the army and show his skills. It is truly moving to face their heartfelt enthusiasm. With such generals who are brave enough to advance, plus his own thrifty and pragmatic enthusiasm, Liu Jingfu will never disappoint the expectations of the entire Central Plains people. According to several captured bandit officers, since the battle in the Central Plains, they no longer believe that Liu Jingfu is a "defeated general." They think that it is a boring insult. Two thousand years ago, Liu Yuzhou started his career in Fengpei, and now Liu Jingfu has taken on the important task of "establishing merit" in ancient Pengcheng. When Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng discussed the generals in front of a wine vessel in Xuchang, they would probably add the name of "hero" to this Liu envoy. The season of golden autumn is here, and the rear may be looking forward to the drop in the thermometer, but in Xuzhou, in the Central Plains, the wind and rain are dark, and you will find that such expectations are so boring!</p>
<h3>Tongxiang Tudian Town Excavates the Tomb of Lu Da</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tongxiang, 5th] About three miles southwest of Tudian Town, in this county, there is a tomb called Lu Da's Tomb, which is said to be the burial place of the Ming Dynasty official Lu Qi. The tomb is three to four zhang high, with an area of more than one mu, and is a well-known ancient site in the surrounding area. Unexpectedly, a part of the tomb was suddenly excavated by people the day before yesterday. When it was first excavated, a stone tablet was found, with the words "Completed in twelve years and three months" and other words. Inside was a black coffin, and the body had not yet rotted. It was wearing a Zao Li hat and Ming Dynasty clothes. There were three jade bowls and a perpetual calendar in the coffin, but they crumbled to the touch. There was also a water tank, a stove, and a small hoard of rice in the tomb, which seemed to be still intact. The tomb bricks are about two feet square and four inches thick, with the words "Made in the summer of the eleventh year of Jiajing" engraved on them. Further inside is a stone door, which is unbreakable, indicating that it is indeed a Ming Dynasty relic. After the tomb was excavated, the villagers reported it to the Tudian Police Station, who learned that the excavation was initiated by Kang, a teacher at a certain school in Nanri Township. He hired workers to excavate at a price of three sheng of rice per work meter. It was also learned that the tomb land was donated to the school by the Shen family. The excavation work has now been suspended, and the excavated body has been buried, awaiting disposal by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Tragic Scenes in Changchun: People Eating People</h3>
<p>Young Children Captured to Satisfy Hunger</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 6th] Outside the National Army's defense lines in Changchun, cruel scenes of people eating people are found everywhere. In the Erdaohuzi area, human meat is openly sold on the streets. Young children are being captured to satisfy hunger.</p>
<h3>Corpse Found in Changzhou: Xu Huolin's Chest and Abdomen Dissected, Criminals Sun Yufang and Feng Youfu Escorted to the Headquarters for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 6th] Chen Dingyi, an army captain in the Wujin Work Group of the Second Assault Detachment of the National Defense Ministry, who also went by the alias Gang, convened his subordinates on the 5th to hold a meeting in Buyiqiao Town. Xu Huolin, a 28-year-old intelligence officer in the Third Division of the Maoshan Bandit Suppression Zone of the Capital Garrison Command, from Danyang, was present at the meeting. His nephew, Sun Xiaopang, 17 years old, had recently been recruited by Chen to work. Sun also worked as a pimp for four women, and the head of his family did not want Xu to go to negotiate. However, considering that Chen's work was introduced to him and that Chen was an acquaintance, he went to Buyiqiao in person to negotiate with Chen. After meeting, Chen first treated him warmly and sent Sun Xiaopang back. Then, he had his subordinates Sun Yufang and Feng Youfu handcuff and secretly murder Xu that night, dumping his body at the Huoqiao Dongzhao wharf. Initially, after Xu was handcuffed, ____ saw the situation and immediately reported to the Seventh Brigade of the Police Supervision Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed in Jintan and the Maoshan Bandit Suppression Third Division Command. Deputy Commander Wang Yusheng led the Ning Police Team to Buyiqiao on the 5th to jointly investigate and rescue him with the standing team of the town. However, Chen Cang fled. When Feng Youfu and others were questioned, the above situation was learned. People were immediately dispatched to the river to retrieve the body. As expected, the deceased's head and neck were covered with wounds, his chest and abdomen were dissected, and his lungs and bowels were protruding, making a very tragic sight. The Command immediately took Sun and Feng, along with a number of pieces of evidence found in Chen's house, back for questioning.</p>
<h3>Pocket News</h3>
<p>Suzhou [Our Newspaper] Zhao Weiyao, the chief of the Wu County Police Bureau, has recently been ordered to be transferred to the Police Security Office as an inspector. His former position will be temporarily filled by Inspector Wang Zongjing. In addition, County Magistrate Wang Jiefo has again submitted a request to the Provincial Government to resign, but it was rejected again.</p>
<p>Tongxiang [Our Newspaper] Since the Third Transportation Office of the Provincial Highway Bureau opened the Jia-Tong section of public bus service, passengers have found it convenient, and the business situation is also very good. However, the vehicles are old and often break down on the way, and the car windows are not complete. It is hoped that the Highway Bureau will improve them quickly.</p>
<p>Yixing [Our Newspaper] Since the central government announced the currency system reform, banks in various places have been ordered to handle the exchange of gold yuan, but Yixing has remained inactive. It is reported that the Yixing office of the Provincial Agricultural Bank also received an exchange order from the head office a few days ago, but only received 2,000 yuan, equivalent to 6 billion legal currency, which they believed was not enough for exchange and delayed starting. Banks and firms are trying to fish in troubled waters, and a large amount of small-denomination legal currency is flowing out, and the local finance is extremely chaotic. Some businesses are even refusing to accept small-denomination legal currency. Banks and firms have not officially exchanged new currency publicly, and the market attitude is novel and waiting and watching.</p>
<h3>Linxia Ignorant People Plot Restoration, Seven Key Criminals Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th] Ma Yunlin, a Linxia native who claimed to be a descendant of the deposed Qing Dynasty, originally named Aiqing Jue Qipu Cun, was induced by bandit Sang Wenbing and Taoist Chen Guhan to call himself "King of Qing Restoration," appointing officials and conferring titles, plotting a riot, and undermining the national system. The case has been judged by the Lanzhou Special Criminal Court. The main culprit, Ma Yunlin, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. Accomplices He Yinggan, Kong Haizhou, Lu Deli, Shi Guoyou, Shi Youcun, and Zhao Lianghui were each sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights. Key criminal Sang Wenbing is at large, and Chen Guhan is deceased, and both have not been apprehended. It is noted that the case was solved in September of last year. After interrogation by the Security Command and the Special Criminal Court, which lasted for years, the "Seal of the King of Qing Restoration," "Seal of the Minister of Beiyang Affairs of the Inner Palace, Loyal Duke," and "Imperial Edict," "Dragon Seal," telescopes, guns, and other items were seized. In his "Imperial Edict" were the words "Loyal Child King, Military Governor of the World's Soldiers and Horses." Ma is 23 years old and his accomplices, the pseudo-monarchs and ministers, are all poor farmers. When he was being escorted back, he said that he was controlled by the evil Taoist. These ignorant people are both pitiful and laughable.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Sabotage the New Currency System: Bandits Launch Vicious Offensive</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Fan Litian</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd (Airmail)] Since the implementation of the currency reform, initial success has been achieved in besieged Jinan within the past ten days. During this period, although some people in this war zone were misled by the rumors and sabotage of the communist bandits, inevitably harboring doubt and watching, there were also a small number of unscrupulous merchants, such as those in the silver, coal, and scarce goods industries, who either refused to sell under the pretext of having no goods or deliberately raised prices. However, after repeated explanations and strict control by the relevant authorities, the people's confidence in the new currency quickly recovered and transitioned from recovery to firm belief. Therefore, generally speaking, various goods in the market were able to be traded at the fixed prices set on August 19th. The Jinan branch of the Central Bank has exchanged a total of 82.382 taels of gold, 31,092.411 taels of silver, 21,809 silver dollars, and 403.20 US dollars in the past ten days. Comparatively speaking, the amount is not small and symbolizes the initial success of the currency reform.</p>
<p>Rumors Collapse of Their Own Accord</p>
<p>In order to sabotage our new currency system, the most vicious trick of the communist bandits is to spread rumors everywhere, saying that the Gold Yuan is just another name for the large-denomination Legal Tender. However, after Yin Wenjing, Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Finance, refuted this using various means on various occasions, this rumor collapsed of its own accord. Director Yin said: "The Gold Yuan is fundamentally different from the Legal Tender. The Legal Tender has no reserve, while the Gold Yuan has a full reserve. The Legal Tender has no legally defined maximum issuance limit, while the Gold Yuan clearly stipulates a maximum limit of 2 billion. The Legal Tender has no fixed exchange rate with foreign currencies, while the Gold Yuan clearly stipulates that every four yuan is equal to one US dollar. The issuance of the Legal Tender has never been transparent, while the reserve and issuance of the Gold Yuan have a strict and transparent inspection system. All of this proves that the Gold Yuan is absolutely not a large-denomination Legal Tender. Those who spread such unfounded rumors are either because of their shallow knowledge or have ulterior motives."</p>
<p>Secretly Purchasing Gold and Silver</p>
<p>The second conspiracy of the communist bandits to sabotage the new currency system is to raise gold and silver prices as much as possible and purchase our gold and silver in large quantities. After the implementation of the new currency system, the government fixed the price of gold at 200 Gold Yuan per tael, equivalent to 600 million Legal Tender, and silver dollars at 2 Gold Yuan per coin, equivalent to 6 million Legal Tender. However, in order to sabotage our new currency, the communist bandits deliberately valued gold at 1 billion Legal Tender per tael and silver dollars at 10 million Legal Tender per coin, and they could be exchanged without limit. For the sake of profit, the common people smuggled to communist-controlled areas regardless of everything. The Shandong Provincial Government, in accordance with the central government's regulation allowing each person to freely carry two taels of gold jewelry, naturally found it inconvenient to stop this when the new currency system was implemented. However, as the outflow gradually increased, it recently had to change its approach. Before the supplementary regulations of the central government on "Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People" are promulgated, it can only temporarily stipulate that even gold jewelry is not allowed to be carried to communist-controlled areas, but it is only temporarily prohibited in order to comply with central government laws.</p>
<p>The Emergence of the Hua Mao Company</p>
<p>The third conspiracy of the communist bandits to sabotage our new currency system is to increase the prices of goods intended to be transported into the Nationalist-controlled areas as much as possible, thereby depreciating the credibility and value of the Legal Tender and the Gold Yuan. In addition to the existing industrial and commercial bureaus in various places, the communist bandits have recently added a "Hua Mao Company," a specialized agency responsible for selling surplus materials from communist-controlled areas and investigating and purchasing materials lacking in the Nationalist-controlled areas. To this end, the Shandong Provincial Government and the Economic Department of the Second Pacification Zone have specially established a "Centralized Committee for the Transportation and Protection of Export and Import Goods." The quantity of goods that exporters intend to transport, the destination area, and what goods they will exchange in return must all be guaranteed in advance and approved by the Economic Department of the Pacification Zone before a permit is issued. Only after inspection by the Inspection Department will transportation be allowed. The main purpose of this is to achieve "bartering" and "adjusting supply and demand" under conditions of severe material scarcity through strict control.</p>
<p>Urgently Promulgate Supplementary Measures. To ensure the complete success of the currency reform, the first thing that is needed is to stabilize the currency value. To stabilize the currency value, the most important thing is to first achieve price stability. In order to achieve price stability, in principle, it is necessary to do at least the following: (1) eliminate floating capital, (2) increase production, and (3) build people's confidence in the Gold Yuan. Therefore, in order to stabilize the currency value, increasing production, or in other words, increasing materials, is also one of the important conditions. In pacification zones like Jinan, all important materials, such as grain, salt, oil, coal, and cotton, mostly come from communist-controlled areas. Since the new currency system was promulgated and prices were frozen at the fixed prices of August 19th, the source of materials has been shortened day by day, coupled with the control or blockade of the communist bandits, causing many of the few remaining materials in the city to flee. Even with effective control, it will eventually lead to "no business to run" and "no goods in the market" due to the lack of material sources. Therefore, from a purely economic point of view, Jinan, under such a siege, must first open up the military situation. In addition to the four laws originally promulgated with the currency reform, the central government should also promptly promulgate some supplementary measures to adapt to the special environment of the pacification zone. Only in this way can the new currency system be further consolidated, and prices in the pacification zone can maintain a long-term stable situation.</p>

<h3>National Banks and Bureaus Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Future Lending Policies: Loan Targets Determined to Focus Especially on Production Enterprises</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, convened a meeting of heads of national banks, bureaus, and treasuries at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss future lending policies. The following two points were decided:</p>
<p>(1) In the future, loans should be strictly reviewed in advance to prevent the use of loans for hoarding and other illegal activities, and strict audits will also be conducted afterward. After this principle is determined, detailed measures will be drafted and submitted to the Joint Council of the Four Banks for decision.</p>
<p>(2) The targets of future loans are limited to: 1. Enterprises producing daily necessities, 2. Basic industries, 3. Export industries, 4. Public utility transportation enterprises. In terms of daily necessities industries, the target of loans is production rather than transportation and sales, and the restrictions are extremely strict.</p>
<p>The results of yesterday's meeting will be submitted to the Joint Council of the Four Banks for approval and will be followed when national banks and bureaus resume lending.</p>
<h3>China Textile Shares to be Issued in Ten Days: Sold on Behalf of China Communications, Farmers Bank, and Other Banks</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Since the China Textile Construction Company decided to reorganize into the China Textile Construction Co., Ltd. starting on the 11th, the new company's shares are expected to be formally launched in about ten days.</p>

However, before the stock exchange resumes business, it will be sold on behalf of banks such as China Communications and Farmers Bank.</p>
<p>Also, national enterprise shares for sale, in addition to China Textile, also include Taiwan Sugar, Taiwan Paper, "China Merchants Bureau," and Tianjin Paper Mill. It is heard that the organization work of these units will also be completed, and they will be issued this week.

<h3>China Farmers Bank's Spring Silkworm Cocoon Reeling Loan Reaches Over 480,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>It was recently learned from the China Farmers Bank that the bank's spring silkworm cocoon reeling loan program for this year has reached a total of 481,788.05 Gold Yuan to date, including 179,160.44 Gold Yuan in Zhejiang Province, 21,404.88 Gold Yuan in Suzhou, 235,108.45 Gold Yuan in Wuxi, and 46,114.28 Gold Yuan in the Shanghai area.</p>

In the second half of the month, the amount was over 220 yuan in the Shanghai area and 210 yuan in other areas. In the first half of August, the amount was over 390 yuan in Shanghai and 380 yuan in other areas.</p>
<h3>Importers and Exporters Urge Authorities to Quickly Issue Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit</h3>
<p>The Municipal Importers and Exporters Association and 16 other trade associations have jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Import Management Committee, the Central Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau, urging them to quickly issue special foreign currency certificates of deposit to the original importers for the price of goods arriving at the port with their own foreign exchange but without import licenses, which the China Trust Bureau had purchased but not yet paid for.</p>
<h3>Errata and Supplementary Items for the Export Goods Price Limit List</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] There were some omissions and errors in the third export goods price limit list announced by the Import Management Committee yesterday. After investigation, the errors that should be corrected are as follows:</p>
<p>Chongqing No. 87 mixed bristle should be changed to Chongqing No. 27 mixed bristle. Tianjin No. 65 mixed bristle should be changed to Tianjin No. 55 mixed bristle. The ordinary export color of male yellow wolfskin should be 2.70 US dollars per piece instead of 2.60 US dollars.</p>
<p>The items that were omitted and should be added are: Feathers: Goose feathers are 48 US cents per pound, duck feathers are 33 US cents per pound, goose down is 1.85 US dollars per pound, and duck down is 1.55 US dollars per pound.</p>
<h3>Raw Tea Production Prices Surge</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to tea industry authorities, the price of tea in various production areas in Tunxi, Anhui, has been rising sharply recently. It is also reported that the Xiuning Tea Industry Association has telegraphed related companies and stack shops here for several days, stating that the price of stir-fried green tea and baked green tea in the Tunxi market has surged, reaching over 80 Gold Yuan per dan including remittance fees, but buyers still need it due to the relationship with the goods. However, tea merchants in this city are deeply concerned about this, because it is difficult to increase prices when everything is stable. At the same time, it is difficult to coordinate exports with this reproduced tea, so the industry currently hopes that the prices in the production areas can be reduced slightly so as not to hinder production and sales.</p>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: The entry and exit of domestic tea were mutual, and the situation was stable. As for export varieties, negotiations were not smooth, and only sporadic transactions were made. In terms of prices, they were all hovering and there were no major changes.</p>
<h3>Credit Remains Stable: Banks and Bureaus Have Net Inflows</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of credit in this city was still stable. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a combined net inflow of 1.48 million in the exchange of bills in the money industry, of which the Central Bank had a net inflow of 1.07 million, the Bank of China had a net inflow of 210,000, the Bank of Communications had a net outflow of 380,000, the Farmers Bank had a net outflow of 50,000, the China Trust Bureau had a net inflow of 420,000, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau had a net inflow of 70,000, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net inflow of 140,000, commercial banks and shops had a net inflow of 1.37 million in large exchanges, a net outflow of 2.87 million in small exchanges, and foreign banks had a combined net inflow of 20,000.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Decides Not to Restore Interbank Term Deposits</h3>
<p>Since the exchange of Gold Yuan for foreign currency began, the amount of floating capital in the market has increased sharply. Responsible persons in the money industry all hope that the Central Bank will restore interbank term deposits to reduce the threat of floating capital to the market. It has now been learned from the Central Bank that interbank term deposits have been discontinued and will not be restored. The past implementation was based on the position of sympathizing with the banks and shops, and it was completely different from absorbing floating capital. The current statutory interest rate is a maximum of 2% per month, and floating capital at this low interest rate has no interest. If the interest rate is increased, there is a suspicion of introducing price increases, and the government has other ways to absorb floating capital, so there is really no need to continue term deposits.</p>
<h3>Household Rice Ration Price Unchanged: Rice Market Weak: High-Quality Japonica and Early Indica Rice Are Available</h3>
<p>The rice market has turned weak because the household rice price has been decided not to be changed, and people's hearts are very empty. Moreover, the economic control is strict, and the owners are quite willing to sell. High-quality Japonica rice and early Indica rice are available. Rice shops do not have strong appetites because household rice has begun to be sold, so they buy less from the market to get rid of dead stock. Although the prices are still at the limit price, the rice quality has improved and the supply is very smooth. The actual price has dropped by 3-5 cents, and Indica rice has dropped by more than 5 cents. Unpolished Indica rice is transported in bags for 16.5 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 4,731 dan arrived from the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Declined, the market was weakest at the beginning of the day because the deadline for shipping stack documents was yesterday, and the owners all wanted to sell. Moreover, the economic control was very strict, and all items outside the industry had dropped, resulting in very few households paying. Bingshun flour opened at only 7.05 yuan, and the market closed slightly stronger at 7.13 yuan because the floating goods were exhausted, a decrease of 10 cents. Lao Che flour decreased by 5 cents, and the decrease was less. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and Xiongpai flour all decreased by 5-10 cents. Bran factories did not open and are still at the limit price.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The market has become weak because rice prices have fallen, people's hearts have calmed down, and the supply of owners has suddenly increased. Although the price of soybeans is still at the limit, the supply is already large, and there are transactions in cart beans and soybeans. The appetite of the North Gang for corn has turned sluggish, and the price has fallen by 5 cents. There are not many transactions in tea beans, and broad beans and red beans are all at the original price, and the supply is large. Only the Shantou Gang takes Yuan wheat, and the market is also stable. Over 200 packages of sesame seeds were offered and traded within the limit. Raw peanuts have not been offered because the Guang Gang has not paid, and there have been no transactions.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Continued to decline because all grains have fallen and people's hearts are very empty. Moreover, the economic control is very strict, and the owners all intend to sell, so the supply is very large. Datong soybean oil opened at 50 yuan and closed at 49.50 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 yuan. Vegetable oil was 45 yuan, 1 yuan lower. Raw oil is at the limit price, but the market has also turned weak, and the supply of small cart sesame oil is already large. Reclaimed bean cakes have been sold, and the market has become sluggish.</p>

<h3>Plan to Improve Border Education: Border School Arts and Sciences Groups to be Divided into Departments This Semester: New Two-Year Students to be Enrolled Next Year</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The National Border School was established to cultivate border cadres. Border people had requested a change in the system in the first half of the year. The Ministry of Education believes that the level of students and equipment conditions at the Border School do not yet make it possible to change to a university or college. It has been decided that starting after the summer vacation, the original teacher training courses in arts and sciences at the school will be changed to arts and sciences departments. In the fourth academic year, the arts department will be divided into language and literature and history and geography groups, and the science department will be divided into mathematics, physics, chemistry, and natural history groups. Starting from the next academic year, in combination with the quota of students in each group in the fourth grade of the five-year arts and sciences program, new students will be recruited for the two-year arts language, history, and geography groups, and science mathematics, physics, chemistry, and natural history groups. Students in each subject group in the five-year system will be reasonably taught. Both the enrollment of border students and the needs of the border areas can be taken into account, and the school's equipment will not feel difficult. In addition to basic academic programs and specialized subjects, the curriculum for the arts and sciences departments will require education courses and will increase knowledge courses in agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, and health as electives. The first three years will focus on basic courses, and the last two years will focus on professional training, which will be connected to the two-year system. Starting this year, the Ministry of Education will allocate funds to expand classrooms, dormitories, libraries, laboratories, and clinics in stages, and to enrich books, instruments, and biological specimens to meet the needs of the changed departments.</p>

<h3>Private College and University Presidents' Symposium: Suggestion to Allocate Scholarships So Impoverished Students Can Pay Tuition and Attend Classes On Time</h3>

The presidents offered the following suggestions: (1) Scholarships for university students should be divided into three tiers: 60 Gold Yuan, 50 Gold Yuan, and 40 Gold Yuan.

<h3>Student Work-Study Program Ends Successfully Mid-Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, organized by the city's YMCA and YWCA, held a student work-study program during the summer vacation, lasting two months from mid-July to mid-September. A large number of students from various schools participated. The work was divided into two types: on-campus and off-campus. On-campus work involved student welfare and labor services such as building school playgrounds. Off-campus work involved being assigned to various social organizations for service. This summer, approximately 500 students from various public and private universities and colleges applied and were approved to participate, with total expenses of approximately 20 billion Legal Tender. After the summer work-study program ends, they will begin to organize the autumn work-study program, but due to insufficient funds, the number of slots may be reduced, and they plan to no longer accept new student applications. Furthermore, Lu Meihui, chairman of the Student Relief Committee, and committee staff members visited the National Shanghai Medical College and Jiaotong University yesterday afternoon to inspect the work-study facilities. A total of sixteen male and female students participating in the work-study program at Shanghai Medical College were wielding hoes in the autumn rain, clearing a corner of barren land, removing weeds and stones, and building roads. Eighty-four students participated in the work-study program at Jiaotong University. The work-study facilities included a self-service cafeteria, laundry service, sewing service, livestock raising, planting, library management, night school, etc. A bowl of "plain noodles" in the self-service cafeteria sells for 180,000 Legal Tender, while laundry and ironing of a shirt costs 220,000 Legal Tender per item, and a suit costs 1.8 million Legal Tender per set, all several times lower than market prices, greatly benefiting impoverished students.

<h3>United States Retains Davis Cup, Doubles Win Over Australia</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, Forest Hills, 5th] The United States has secured its 15th victory in the Davis Cup tennis tournament.

<h3>Public Sports Competitions Must Apply to the Municipal Sports Association: Wheel Cup and Yaqin Cup Procedures Non-Compliant</h3>
<p>In order to manage and maintain amateur sports throughout the city and to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities, the Shanghai Sports Association requires that all sports organizations in the city must apply to the Association for permission to hold public sports competitions ten days before the competition is held. It has been found that the recent Wheel Cup and Yaqin Cup mini-football competitions did not apply for permission in advance, which is not in compliance. While it is certainly permissible for various groups to promote sports competitions, the procedures and methods should be carried out in accordance with regulations in order to maintain sports ethics. Furthermore, any team participating in competitions organized by various groups must be approved by the Association in order to maintain the noble purpose of amateur teams. In order to clarify the procedures for holding public sports competitions for sports organizations in the city, the Shanghai Sports Association is reprinting the "Application Guidelines for Shanghai Sports Organizations to Hold Public Sports Competitions" as follows:</p>
<p>[Application Guidelines for Shanghai Sports Organizations to Hold Public Sports Competitions] (1) In order to manage and maintain amateur sports throughout the city and to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities, the Shanghai Sports Association (hereinafter referred to as "the Association") has formulated application forms and application guidelines for sports organizations in the city to hold public sports competitions. (2) Public organizations in the city holding public sports competitions should fill out the application form truthfully and apply to the Association ten days before the competition date, and may only hold the competition after permission has been granted and the application has been filed. (3) Public organizations in the city wishing to raise funds for charity and public welfare through public competitions and selling tickets must obtain the Association's approval in advance before selling tickets publicly. (4) For the sale of tickets for competitions, the printed tickets must be sent to the Association in advance to be stamped to indicate seriousness. (5) The proceeds from the sale of tickets for competitions should, in principle, not deduct expenses. (6) Necessary expense accounts for competitions must be submitted to the Association for review before being published in the newspaper to ensure credibility. (7) Teams requested for competitions shall be contacted by the various organizations themselves. (8) Any team participating in competitions organized by various organizations, whether tickets are sold or not, must be approved by the Association. (9) In addition to arranging the competition venue themselves, the Association will also notify them. (10) These guidelines shall be implemented after being approved by the Standing Council of the Association.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Basketball Tournament Ends: Huili Defeats Chenyou by a Wide Margin, Dagong Defeats Renyu</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the final day of the basketball charity tournament organized by the Municipal Education Bureau to benefit impoverished student scholarships. Due to the rain, only about 400 spectators attended, with ticket revenue of 294 Gold Yuan. The total revenue for the three days was 1,932 Gold Yuan. Yesterday's two matches: Huili defeated Chenyou by a large margin of 64 to 41, and Dagong defeated Renyu by a score of 56 to 37.</p>
<p>Chenyou's Luck and Skill Are Poor</p>
<p>Huili and Chenyou took the court at 7:00 PM. After the start of the game, Moses shot first for Chenyou. Huili's Wei Xu returned the shot, followed by Zhang Pu, taking the lead. After 4 points each, Huili's offensive suddenly increased. Fu Haiyun continuously hit shots, as if divinely assisted. Chenyou's luck was extremely poor, and they repeatedly missed shots. Huili's score rose steadily. At the end of the first half, Huili had an absolute advantage with a score of 30 to 12.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Chenyou adjusted its personnel to try to recover lost ground. Chenyou's He Jingui shot two goals on the sidelines, regaining four points. Yongfang and Wei Xu from Huili passed in a series and shot, and Huili's momentum remained high. Chenyou only had the ability to parry. After 44 to 25, Fu Hai and Zhiji charged left and right, unstoppable. Chenyou called a timeout, but it was of no use. Losing too many points made them panic. Finally, Qi Xia and He Zeng showed some improvement, but it was too late to save the overall situation. As a result, Huili defeated Chenyou by a large margin of 64 to 41.</p>

<p>Renyu's Strength: Battle Suffers Setbacks</p>
<p>Next, Dagong and Renyu faced off. At the beginning of the game, Jiazhou fouled, and Cunzhong scored on a free throw, breaking the score. Longtan followed, shooting in the crowd. Guozheng bumped into someone, and Wenlong was injured, stopping the game for half a minute. Wenlong scored once again, making it 10 to 11. Longtan and Wenyi scored back and forth, and Yunke Xinrong and Pengju each gained something, making the score 19 to 12. Dagong adjusted its personnel, with Wenhua replacing Lianke. Taking advantage of Dagong's unstable formation, Renyu regained four points. Cunzhong shot from afar, and Wenhua charged in, making it 28 to 17. Dagong led in the first half.</p>
<p>After the break, the game resumed, and Dagong's offensive did not weaken. After 34 to 20, Renyu's offensive improved. Wenyi Zhong scored repeatedly, and Renyu chased hard. In close combat, there was an atmosphere of revival, 35 to 39, with Dagong only leading by three points. Lianke returned, and the generals showed renewed enthusiasm. Wenhua shot from afar and shot closely, scoring four goals alone. Renyu was unable to look ahead or behind, with many loopholes. In the end, Dagong defeated Renyu with a score of 56 to 37.</p>

<h3>Memories of the War-Torn Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lan Ke</p>
<p>Su Dongpo said, "Events are like spring dreams, leaving no trace." The past is like a dream, and old events are like smoke. The past is the past, and memory seems superfluous. However, who is without emotion? I lived in Bianjing for nearly ten years, and naturally, I have an indescribable love for it. In this war-torn world, who would have thought that this aging ancient city would encounter an unprecedented catastrophe in its history! From newspaper reports and letters from friends, I learned that the beautiful old residence outside the South Gate, the magnificent provincial government and post office buildings, the towering Drum Tower and the ancient ruins of the Nengting, and the bustling Xiangguo Temple, which celebrated every festival, have all been reduced to rubble and ruins after this arson. The Tang and Song cultural relics that had survived for over a thousand years have all been destroyed by the ruthless cannon fire. Now, as I recall them, in addition to sadness, it feels like reliving childhood dreams, just like a ruined son boasting to others about the valuable antiques and calligraphy that he has lost. Perhaps others will laugh at me for being a fool dreaming, but as Tao An's Dream Memories says in its preface, "It is good to dream," I want to cherish this quiet, old dream...</p>
<p>In terms of size, the city of Kaifeng is far smaller than the vastness of Nanjing, nor is it as great as Beijing. Compared with large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou in terms of prosperity and modernization, it is of course relatively small, and it cannot even compare to the most basic Jinan. Not to mention the more Europeanized Qingdao and Harbin. However, Kaifeng does not have the air of a semi-colony like these Europeanized cities, which may not be Kaifeng's misfortune. Living in Kaifeng, one only feels that it is simple and unadorned, with an antique charm, like a small-scale Beijing - even quieter than Beijing. From Zhongshan Avenue all the way to Longting, from West Avenue all the way to East Avenue, a dozen miles across, even during the busiest time of day, when the sidewalks are crowded with people, it still feels quiet and orderly. Rickshaw pullers, sweating profusely, never forget to greet passersby politely with "Excuse me."</p>
<p>The weather in Kaifeng is colder in winter than in the south, but not as bitterly cold as in other parts of North China. Although it is hot in summer, it is very cool at night, without the sultry heat of Nanjing and Hankou at night. The four seasons, spring is especially short, and autumn is especially long. Autumn in Bianliang is an especially lovely time. Every time the autumn sky is clear and the wind is light, riding to the Yuhuangtai in the suburbs to see the maple leaves, or climbing the Iron Pagoda of Longting in the high autumn sky to look out, looking north at the rolling Yellow River, one can appreciate a true Northern autumn, a kind of desolate scene of "Hu Jia interacting, and the sad cries of grazing horses."</p>
<p>What is most worth mentioning is the simplicity of the people of Bianjing. From high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants to peddlers and hawkers, they all have a lovely, ancient atmosphere. For example, when bargaining with rickshaw pullers, every puller always answers with the utmost humility, saying, "Just give whatever you old man/madam think is appropriate." When going to any shop to buy something, whether you buy it or not, the shopkeeper and the staff will always offer tea and let you sit down, and finally bow to 90 degrees to send the customer out the door, which is truly incomparable to the aloof and condescending attitude of employees in large companies in Shanghai. I remember that the errand boys, rickshaw pullers, and old maids hired at home when I was a child were all diligent and loyal, and they never changed for eight or nine years, which is truly incomparable to the "morning Qin and evening Chu" maids in Shanghai families now.</p>
<p>When recalling any place in the past, one can never forget the food. Kaifeng's "Yiyucun" sugar-coated yam, "Wei Chunlou's" braised Yellow River carp, and "Liangyuan's" roasted duck, their delicious flavors are unforgettable to me forever. Other dishes, such as Ma Yuanxing's oily chicken on Gulou Street, and "Du Yichu's" dried shrimp and Chinese cabbage, are especially missed. These places where I often lingered in the past have probably all turned to ashes.</p>
<p>The easiest place in Kaifeng to evoke ancient feelings is Xiangguo Temple. Xiangguo Temple is complex, multi-faceted, very much like Tianqiao in Beijing. From every corner, you can read a fragmented history of Tang and Song society. From the storytelling of drum books and the variety of miscellaneous shows, you can see scene after scene of the tragic dramas of human life. The last time I returned to Bian, I saw that Xiangguo Temple was already dilapidated, Longting had been in disrepair for many years, and the Iron Pagoda had been damaged by Japanese soldiers with artillery fire. Who knew that four years later, Longting would become a battlefield of cannon fire that attracted national attention, and Xiangguo Temple was probably already razed to the ground. Perhaps only the Iron Pagoda still stands unharmed?</p>
<p>The only thing that makes people feel annoyed is the wind and sand on the streets. The wind and sand in Kaifeng seem to be even worse than in Beijing. Whenever going out, when the wind rises, gusts of gray sand will often cover one's head and face. When returning home and undressing, the neck is full of sand. It is common for the ground and the table to be covered with a layer of sand an inch or two thick.</p>
<p>I remember that the "Reminiscences of the Xuanhe Era of the Great Song Dynasty" specifically describes the section in which Emperors Huizong and Qinzong of the Northern Song Dynasty were captured and taken north, which is tragic and moving, and one cannot bear to read it to the end. Upon receiving a letter from a friend, I did not expect that the casualties of the people in Kaifeng in this Central Plains war would be so great that they could not be compared with the fall of Bianjing by the Jin Dynasty in the Northern Song Dynasty. It can be said to be a catastrophic disaster that is absolutely appalling! This aging ancient city is finished. The place where talented people gathered in the past is now a scene of rubble. Perhaps only the hateful wind and sand are still constantly flying all over this broken ancient city. (Xiangguo Temple, Kaifeng)</p>
<h3>Close to Sentence in the Deep Clouds</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>In Jin Garden, Gao Yao, Little Ji Mountain, who is leisurely for two days with specialized egrets? The mountains and rivers have never bothered the crazy visitors, and the storms of Juqu can still be stubborn.</p>
<p>Tender transport is subtly paired with clear cups, enjoying the lotus breeze in a hectare of ponds. Scholars do not need to be proud of their large brushes, for pearls leap on the leaves when the time is right. (The pond lotus is a famous species of eighteen scholars, and those that have not yet bloomed are like sharp pens piercing the air, numbering in the thousands.)</p>
<p>Looking south from Big Ji, how many points are open in the ten thousand acres of waves? In the midst of the flickering seventy-two peaks, returning sails are like anchors cutting through the clouds.</p>
<p>Greedily hiding guests is also virtuous, and famous chefs are just right for shrimp and fish delicacies. Shi Ran loves to lie with Sanlang, coldly eyeing Rong Hou laughing at the drunken immortals. (Yu Sanlang once said that he had never seen my drunken state, so that night I got very drunk, singing and playing until after midnight, greatly troubling Sanlang. He secretly peeked at my drunken state, and when I went to bed and called out to him, he repeatedly snored. The next day, he used it as a laughing stock.)</p>
<p>The new transmission of the powder book is happy to enlighten the ignorant, how can strange postures and transformations be the same? There are skillful painters in the world, and there is no creation in heaven. Who among the many historians can boast of their brushwork? Only your family is allowed to be called heroic. Jiang Lang is knowledgeable about the spirit, and the golden mirror is beautiful for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Selling Books</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>I haven't bought many books this year because book prices are high and income is low. Every time I think about using some of the money I've saved to buy a book I once saw in a bookstore, the money is always diverted to other urgent needs, so I can only leave the hope for next time. And the chance for "next time" is often sacrificed so lightly, so I list buying books as a luxury and don't dare to frolic around in bookstores casually.</p>
<p>Because I can't afford new books, I think of my old books. If I sell some of my old books, can't I exchange them for a few new ones? So I thought of the twelve volumes of "Esquire" magazine that had been gathering dust in the corner of my desk. These twelve volumes of "Esquire" were ordered directly from the United States by the bookstore last winter when the exchange rate was still relatively stable. There were a few twists and turns in being able to preserve them to this day. The address I left at the bookstore was my office address. Every issue of the magazine could always be received around the 16th of each month, without much delay. But after receiving the June issue of "Esquire," the July issue did not arrive for a long time. Instead, the August issue was received on August 17th. I guessed that it was mostly lost, otherwise how could the August issue come and the July issue be so late?</p>
<p>But I still have to try to find it. If I can't find it, I'll have to buy a replacement. I asked the reception at the office to check. Many foreign magazines are sent to another department for reference and research after being received by the reception. I guessed that this magazine might have been mixed into the laboratory. This guess was indeed correct. The result of the inquiry was, as expected, that it was there, and after being opened, read, and borrowed by the staff, it was still lying quietly on the bookshelf because no owner had come to claim it. At first, when I inquired, I was completely thinking of trying to find something that could not be found. Now that I actually found it, so that the magazine for the whole year would not be missing, I was quite happy.</p>
<p>This time, when I decided to sell books, the first thing that came to mind was the whole year's twelve issues of "Esquire." I thought, let's sell them and exchange them for a few new books to read. On the evening when I decided to sell this beloved magazine, I couldn't help but feel a sense of reluctance. I had looked at every cartoon inside, read every short article, and given up on the longer novels that I had prepared to keep and read slowly. This opportunity was clearly lost. And all those countless, unspoken and spoken cartoons, as well as the painted women of style, were all about to be separated from me at this moment, and I couldn't help but feel sad. Not to mention these, just taking the advertisements in "Esquire" magazine as a textbook would be enough for you to appreciate and ponder. All these things were about to be separated from me tomorrow, and there was a great distance between them and the original dusty corner of the desk!</p>
<p>The next day, I decided to sell them. I ran into an old bookstore, and the owner was very welcoming when he heard that it was "Esquire." He asked me what year they were from. I told him it was 1947, twelve complete issues. He said, "Let's see, I'll give you three million altogether," which is one Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>This number made me shiver in the scorching sun of early September. One Gold Yuan! It's not enough to exchange for a new "Esquire," it's not even enough to buy a "Late Post Weekly," let alone a "Modern Library" book!</p>
<p>I could only put the twelve books back down. It's better not to sell them. Can't I review the old and learn the new? But the hope of reading new books has to be postponed again.</p>
<h3>American Preliminary Examination System</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>The American trial procedure has always been slow and protracted. It is common for a case to be delayed for years before a verdict is reached, and some cases have even been delayed for four years before a verdict is reached. In order to reform this drawback, courts in Washington, Boston, Detroit and other places are now using a preliminary examination system. The results of the trial implementation have been very effective, and state courts in various places have also followed suit and established preliminary examination courts.</p>
<p>The preliminary examination system does not infringe on individual rights, but it eliminates most of the red tape, cumbersome procedures, and cunning tricks of professional lawyers. The concept of preliminary examination originated in England in the nineteenth century. In 1929, it was introduced to the American judiciary by two judges of the Circuit Court of Michigan, and it was first implemented in Detroit with good results. Six years later, Boston also established a preliminary examination court, with equally satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the U.S. Supreme Court became interested in the preliminary examination experiment. In 1938, a committee of the Supreme Court resolved to modernize the procedural rules of all federal courts and authorized federal judges to freely establish preliminary examination courts. The preliminary examination system was then established.</p>
<p>The procedure of each preliminary examination court varies slightly depending on the personality of the judge. Taking the preliminary examination court of the District of Columbia (i.e., Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States) as an example, it is as follows:</p>
<p>Two weeks before the formal trial, the preliminary examination judge first summons the lawyers of both the plaintiff and the defendant. At the hearing, he first listens to the points agreed upon by both parties, and then listens to the points of contention. Then, the judge restates the case and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of both sides according to his opinion. Finally, there is an on-the-spot mediation, and if a settlement is reached, the case is resolved.</p>
<p>If the judge fails to mediate, he will record a preliminary examination record, which records the main points of the lawyers' statements. Once this preliminary examination record is approved by the lawyers, it becomes the basis for the formal trial. During the formal trial, neither party is allowed to dispute the points that have been agreed upon in the preliminary examination, nor can new arguments be put forward, unless the judge believes that the preliminary examination judge has made a mistake or is unfair. If a lawyer of either party discovers appropriate new evidence, the judge usually allows him to present it.</p>
<p>In this way, the case is much simpler when the formal trial begins, and the verdict does not have to be delayed unnecessarily.</p>
<h3>Don't Worry</h3>
<p>— Fei Yu</p>
<p>Worry comes for no reason, and many people often ruin their health by being melancholy. But as long as we can analyze it with a calm and scientific eye, worry really shouldn't exist in this world. Let's look at an analysis of worry from a soldier during wartime.</p>
<p>During World War I, there were two good friends in England, Dick and Yang, who were conscripted for training at the same time. After the training, Dick was transferred to the European continent to fight first. After the farewell, Dick was very optimistic and content with his situation, while Yang was frowning all day long, worrying about the danger of being killed in battle. Dick, knowing this on the front lines, sent him a letter, saying on the surface:</p>
<p>"In your current situation, one of the following things must happen: either you are mobilized or you are not mobilized. If you are not mobilized, you don't need to worry. If you are mobilized, then one of the following things must happen: either you are transferred to the rear or you are transferred to the front. If you are transferred to the rear, you don't need to worry. If you are transferred to the front, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are in a safe zone or you are in a dangerous zone. If you are in a safe zone, you don't need to worry. If you are in a dangerous zone, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are not injured or you are injured. If you are not injured, you don't need to worry. If you are injured, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are slightly injured or you are seriously injured. If you are slightly injured, you don't need to worry. If you are seriously injured, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are cured or you die. If you are cured, you don't need to worry. If you die, then you can't worry!"</p>
<p>This letter was seen by the communication inspector in the army. Because it was written in a very unique way, he copied a copy of it verbatim. The next day, a newspaper published it under the title "Don't Worry". Three or four days later, this letter was translated into various languages, and newspapers and magazines printed it on the front page in large type, and radio stations used it as a broadcast. Thus, a work recognized as the best analysis of psychology was produced in the hands of an unknown soldier.</p>

<h3>### Incompatible Interests Make It Difficult to Grow Old Together - Four-Year Engagement Planned to Be Terminated - Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>Chen Xuefen asks: I was engaged to a certain gentleman four years ago. Recently, I discovered that our personalities are completely incompatible and our interests do not align. Because I had very little contact with the gentleman before and after our engagement, we did not have a deep understanding of each other. Even if we were to force a marriage, it would be difficult to grow old together. Therefore, I plan to terminate the engagement, but I do not know how to handle the formalities. Please instruct me in detail, esteemed lawyer.</p>
<p>[Mr. Tang Mingshi answers] In law, an engagement may not be compelled by force (see Article 975 of the Civil Code), but the termination of an engagement must meet certain conditions (see Article 976 of the same law). If the conditions (also known as causes) listed in Article 976 are not met, and the engagement is violated, damages shall be compensated to the other party. The so-called incompatible personalities and misaligned interests mentioned in your letter do not constitute conditions (or causes) for termination in law. This is because such so-called "incompatibility" and "misalignment" are subjective and have no objective standard to measure them. As for the termination formalities, other than mutual consent, it is to file a lawsuit for termination based on the law. However, marriage involves a certain degree of risk and should not be considered too carefully. The nature of men and women may be different, and sometimes they can complement each other because of inconsistent personalities; and they can learn from each other because of misaligned interests. The value of a husband and wife lies in mutual understanding and love; they should understand, help, and accompany each other for life. Strengths and weaknesses should complement each other, and it is not necessary for everything to be the same. Please think carefully! Do not lose the opportunity to find a partner due to temporary self-awareness.</p>
<h3>Lost and Found</h3>
<p>Lost and Found Fountain Pen: I borrowed a fountain pen from a gentleman at the bicycle licensing office in this city the other day. When I finished using it, the gentleman was nowhere to be found, so I could not return it. Please come to Chen Lugen at the Dongfang Auto Shop at the intersection of Beile Road and Ximen Road to collect it after seeing this announcement.</p>
<p>Searching for Weaving Machine Blueprint: I lost a blueprint of a weaving machine on Jiangxi Road on the evening of the 30th of last month. I hope that the finder will return it and I will offer a small reward. Chen Jitai, 297 Huangdu Road.</p>
<p>Requesting Shen Bao: I would like to request one copy each of the Shen Bao from August 23rd and 27th. If anyone is willing to part with them, please send them to Bao Shusen, Public Works Bureau, Hankou Road.</p>
