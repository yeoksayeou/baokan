<h3>國大建議政府　簡化剿匪機構　通電聲討共黨案交主席團辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國民大會廿一日晨通過「簡化各地剿匪機構，並加强其職權案」，建議政府切實辦理，其辦法要點如下：（一）簡化剿匪指揮機構，在剿匪區內須設剿匪統一指揮機構，其重複機構一律予以撤銷。（二）配合及加强地方武力，無匪或匪退之區，地方治安應交由地方團隊負責，惟事先必須加强其組織訓練，充實其裝備，並時策其安全，以免爲匪刧持。（三）中央應放寬法令尺度，在剿匪區內可自定臨時救急政策。（四）在匪區內之省市文官，自省主席，市長，武官自軍長及各地軍區司令以下，均受剿匪總司令節制指揮。（五）中央各部會所屬之機關，學校，均應配合剿匪總部法令，執行職務，此負責人不能勝任者，得報請中央予以撤換。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國民大會廿一日晨通過，以大會名義通電聲討共黨及號召全國同胞擁護戡亂建國國策。該案係（一）高仲謙等提：共產黨擁兵造亂，禍國殃民，請大會通電全國，全世界聲罪致討，以揭發暴行，而張全民撻伐案。其辦法爲：一，用大會名義通電全國聲討，二，用大會名義通電全世界，揭發共匪陰謀罪行，免受共匪虛僞宣傳蒙蔽，以正國際視聽。（二）高仲謙等提：請本大會通電全國，號召全體同胞，一致擁護戡亂建國國策，加緊實行總動員，以期迅平匪亂，而固國本案。其辦法爲：一，由大會決議交未來新政府，繼續執行戡亂國策，俾竟全功，二，由大會通電，號召全國同胞及海外僑胞，一致繼續擁護戡亂建國國策，加緊動員戡亂，以期迅平匪亂，而固國本。當經大會決定，交主席團辦理。</p>

<h3>陜人事即調</h3>
<p>今政務會可作決定</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日〕陜西省人事將有調整。頃聞當局業已內定，可望於廿二日政務會議中通過。現任陜主席祝紹周將調中央軍校敎育長，關麟徵繼任陜主席。又胡宗南將調任中央軍校校長，馬鴻逵出任西北剿開總司令。</p>
<h3>糧食營業稅　潘公展等提請免征</h3>
<p>國大昨正式通過</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕潘公展等五十人所提「請國府明令免徵糧食營業稅，以維民食，而蘇民困案」，審査會擬定原則通過，送政府飭令主管機關切實辦理，經廿一日大會通過。該案所持理由爲目前危急存亡之秋，不使民食充裕，則禍患將不堪設想，故免征糧稅，實為補救時艱之要圖，但各省市對此頗不一致，如魯·川等省則主緩征，滬市亦認爲應免征，平·穗·杭·合亦經緩免糧稅，而糧食之徵稅重疊，不啻增加糧價，而對社會秩序尤易遭受影響，特提出辦法兩項，（一）由國府明令永遠免徵糧食營業稅。（二）各省市府不得假借任何名義征收糧食捐稅等。</p>
<h3>改革幣制</h3>
<p>國大建議採金本位</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕有關改革幣制之提案，經國大提出者共計四件，一爲吳逸志等六十一人所提之「爲安定金融，建議發行新幣案」。一爲莫紹周等三十二人所提「迅速改革幣制，穩定金融，安定人心案」。一爲宋淵源等四十人所提「此次政府報吿經濟，認爲安定物價，充實軍費之治本方策，首應改革幣制，並應定期實行案」。一爲裴鴻宇等二十五人所提「請迅速改革幣制，以維國計民生案」。經審査會四案合併審査，決定原則通過，送政府立即成立幣制改革委會，儘速擬定計劃實行，並經二十一日大會中獲致通過。吳案內所擬辦法分爲二期，第一期由國家撥出價値新幣十二億元之物資，組成建國銀行，由國大組監督委會，負該行產業之保管，監督及新幣之印刷與發行監督之責，另由國大全體代表負責担保新幣有效，新幣採金匯兌本位制，以新銀幣爲流通籌碼（第一期僅發紙幣），即新幣一元等於法幣十萬元，新幣三元等於美金一元，以六億之新幣收回法幣六十餘萬億元，以六億元作爲國家平衡收支及建設之用。第二期即發行新銀幣十二億元，一俟硬幣發行兌現無阻，國大之監督委會即交還政府處理。莫案亦認爲應改爲金幣爲本位，銀幣爲輔幣，另發可以充分兌現之法幣。宋案則僅以質詢態度，敦促政府早日促成幣制之改革，以穩定金融。</p>
<h3>徵用豪門存款　三提案中詳列辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕關於徵用豪門存款問題，國大有提案本件，一為何佛情等廿一人所提，一為翁檉等卅四人所提，一爲龍文等卅七人所提，經第四審査委會合併審査後，決定「原則通過，建議政府，限三個月內制定辦法，切實執行，公開報吿。」廿一日大會中已予通過。該三案中所提出之辦法，約列以次數端：（一）以國大名義，電請美國杜魯門總統。馬歇爾國務卿，將我在美存款人姓名及其數額公布，並即封存；（二）由國大遵照國父節制資本之遺敎，議定各人資本最高限額，其超額部份由政府沒收，如政府官吏擁有超額之資金時，除沒收外，交法院偵査審理；（三）由大會定一原則，交立院訂定「淸査豪門資本」及「征收豪富特捐」之條例公布施行，至其收入，則全部撥充救濟難民經費基金；（四）由大會授權監察院，由監委組織徵借委會，多方調査國內外各銀行豪門存款，如有發現，一律徵借作爲國用，所有軍政不敷各費，均賴此支用，並由政院令全國各省縣市政府，人民於應納之田賦外，其他捐稅分別减免，所有各省縣市行政經費不數者，槪由徵借豪門存款內撥補。</p>
<h3>孫科談中蘇關係　猛烈抨擊蘇不履行條約　對放棄立委資格重申堅決立場</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕孫科廿一日下午五時在其寓邸接見記者，對蘇聯作前所未有之猛烈抨擊，渠稱：蘇聯不履行條約，爲千眞萬確之事實，其推托爲難之藉口謂對日戰爭仍存在，簡直是無理取鬧。孫氏聞記者所吿某蘇聯外交人員評其言諭不穩，不信渠之當選副總統將有益中·蘇邦交之事後，顯被激怒。渠指陳，鞍山失陷後，工廠機器已大部被拆遷至大連，轉運海參崴，斥責蘇聯在東北予取予求，行同「强盜」。渠對設若渠當選副總統是否仍願努力於加强中·蘇外交，增進友誼一節，未作正面答復。渠稱：時勢明白之至，國大東北代表對蘇觀感如何，衆所均知，中·蘇關係之未來，胥視蘇聯有無履行條約，和平相處之誠意，試問中·蘇兩國之地位，如予調換，蘇聯又將如何。渠認義大利普選共黨慘敗，可使西歐局勢好轉，利於復興，但恐義國社會將爲共黨之直接行動引起騷動，全世界之共黨均正以蘇聯爲中心，在各國先藉口民主，爭取羣衆，但於循正規方式失敗後，即不擇手段。我國共匪叛國造亂逢處先消滅抗力，後强行政策，政府必以全面之政治改革，乃可保證戡亂之成功。</p>
<p>〔又電〕孫科廿一日向記者證實其放棄立委當選資格之事實。渠稱，現雖未屆立院成立選舉院長之時，但爲免除政敵之攻擊，乃提前聲明放棄立委當選，以表明專志全力競選副總統，並謂立委當選資格之放棄，在任何情形下均將堅持，決不能出爾反爾。渠對張知本等所提憲法修正案「國大代表人民行使創制複決權」，認爲應無疑問，複決權相當外國之公民投票，然創制權則乏成例，此兩政權所待硏討者爲如何行使之技術問題。</p>
<h3>于右任氏發表　婦女問題意見</h3>
<p>請切實保障婦女權益</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕競選副總統之于右任院長，頃以「怎樣解決中國婦女問題」一文，向國大婦女代表曁全國婦女界發表其對中國婦女問題之意見。該文分三要點：第一爲解決婦女職業問題，主張婦女必須參加實際行政工作及社會各部門工作，行憲後政府應切實執行有關婦女權益之規定；第二爲解決婦女敎育問題，主張普及婦女敎育，提高其文化水準，並培植婦女專門人才；第三爲解決歸女經濟問題，强調婦女經濟之自由自宅，確立同工同酬之原則。結論謂：行憲後的中國，婦女一定要求在政治·敎育·經濟·社會上一切與男子全面平等。聞國大婦女代表，對于院長此項有力之主張，極表贊佩。</p>
<h3>常設機構問題</h3>
<p>國大主席團曾作討論</p>

<h3>國大檢討經濟</h3>
<p>代表攻擊燃管會工作</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國大舉行經濟檢討時，各代表對於經部燃管會工作攻擊頗烈，尤對於燃管會配售煤價較黑市爲高，卅六年之盈餘迄未繳解國庫，均深致不滿。經濟部長陳啓天廿一日答復各代表詢問時，巳對此加以說明。陳氏已承認開灤煤在滬配售價較在秦皇鳥船上交貨價高出甚多，但因每噸須另加鐵路保安費，北寗路雙軌修復費，船舶用費及上海碼頭用費等，共二，七一六，〇〇〇元，故在滬之配價爲六，九九〇，〇〇〇元，至上年度燃管會盈餘一千三百餘億元，陳氏亦承認無誤，惟稱：係作爲存煤之周轉金，是以尙未繳解國庫。</p>
<h3>公教人員待遇</h3>
<p>國大請政府予以提高</p>

<h3>社論　今後的邊疆政策</h3>
<p>國民大會第七審査會，廿日全日開會，繼續處理有關邊疆之提案三十四件，決議送請政府參酌辦理。提案的範圍很廣，舉儿邊疆行政，任用各宗族人才，邊疆政策，邊疆經濟建設，以及有關邊疆敎育，邊疆學術硏究與調査等，均有建議和決定。歸納各案的精神，是要政府確定一邊疆政策，以新的政風和新的設施，促進邊胞的內向，而達到國族團結之目的。</p>
<p>這次國大的召開，其代表有來自康藏雲貴的高原，有來自蒙古新疆的沙漠，有來自苗嶺高山的荒林；論種族，有滿蒙回藏苗僮夾傜及高山族。這次大會，凝結中華民族於一家，聚集邊地精英於一堂，網羅代表的普遍性，可以說是前所未有。尤其在此國勢危急，聚集邊地代表共商今後邊疆政策，其意義更覺特別深厚。國民大會雖非決策機關，代表的建議性意見，並不一定要政府完全執行，但這千載一時機會的所得，實在値得珍貴。邊地代表不遠千里而來，他們帶着無限希望，內心蘊蓄無限痛苦，他們的提議，他們的要求，他們的呼聲，應該特別重視。國大第七審査會，是專鬥審査邊疆政策和邊地代表提案的集會，三十四件提案的通過，其內容性質儘管不同，可是每案有條理，有內容，意義深厚，事關重大，今後的新政府，自應重視這些提議，合英咀華，截長補短，以作決定今後邊疆政策之參考。</p>
<p>所謂邊疆政策，具體說來，就是邊遠數省的宗族·政治·經濟·文化諸問題。我國邊疆宗族，分佈於東北·東南·西北，在地理上，有的存在着巨川　嶺海洋等　然界綫，有的則是一片沙蹟，廣漠無垠，其言語信仰風俗習慣多與內地人民異致，其社會經濟的發展，往往停滯在農業經濟的前期，生活固特殊，文化又十分落後。在這情形下，加以歷代邊政措施的失當，逐覺形格勢禁，諸多隔閡，更加上國際關係中的外鑠因素，遂使一切問題日趨複雜化嚴重化了。因此，今後的邊疆政策，首先必須防止外鑠因素，以求自保，其次則是內求改革，促進邊地政治經濟的進步，導使社會風尙文化敎育，儘量與內地交流，逐漸走向中華一家的大目標。</p>
<p>外鑠因素反映在邊疆問題上的，如民國成立後的外　問題，抗戰前的東北問題，和現階段的新疆問題，其境界斜紛民族糾紛，都是外鑠因素的反映。從地緣政治說來，隣國民族勢力的成長尖端，向我們的邊境推進，共方式無論是倚仗武力，或施以政治壓力，或雜以移民手段，甚或施以同種人民的相互吸引，其目的要不外使其民族勢力長成尖端，直向我國境界內延擴，而我國和平的緩衝的境界，則日益向內縮小。任何一個獨立國家，都有其邊界問題，如昆連隣國民族勢力的成長尖端，直向本國發展，本國爲了自保自守，或爲安全感所驅使，在國防上政治上必需樹立獨立自主的邊疆政策，以防外鑠勢力的深入。我國邊界與隣國壤土相接數千里，我們爲了和平相處，爲了自保自守，或爲了避免本國宗族遭受外族吸引，我們應該樹立積極的民族政策，和國防安全的政策。新憲法第十三章基本國策，規定「中華民國之國防，以保衛國家安全，維護世界和平爲目的。」所謂國家安全，就是邊疆安全；要固國防，必先要固邊防。無邊疆安全，一國的和平便失去保障，爲了維護世界和平，首先必須要保衛邊疆安全的。我們希望今後的邊疆政策，應以保衛邊疆案全爲第一目標。</p>
<p>其次，關於邊疆政治經濟制度的改革，社會風尙的改良，文化敎育的溝通，今後必需以進步的開明的政策，交由睿智的政治家來執行。蘇聯掌管少數民族行政的，是第一流的政治家；日本往昔的拓殖行政，是國內傑出的人物。我國今後的邊疆行政，在地方以遴選邊地優良人才為原則，在中央以第一流政治家主掌邊政爲原則。至於政策方案，新憲法第一六八條規定：『國家對於邊疆地區各民族之地位，應予以合法之保障，並於其地方自治事業中，特別予以扶植。」這是對邊疆政治方面宗族方面施以平等的政策。其第一六九條規定：「國家對於邊疆地區各民族之敎育，文化，交通，水利，衛生，及其他經濟，社會事業，應積極舉辦，並扶助其發展。對於土地使用，應依其氣候，土壤性質，及人民生活習慣之所宜，予以保障及發展。」這是對邊疆各省特別釐定的進步政策，以國家之力扶助邊疆進步與發展，與歷代覊糜懷柔的方式，逈然不同。我們希望今後的邊疆政策，應根據憲法的精神，澈底地加以執行，不但保證了國內民族的緊密團結和統一，而且保證了三民主義民族革命的完成。</p>
<p>今天的中華時代，是中華一家的時代，是邊疆新時代的開始。新憲法確定了邊疆政策的原則，國大邊地代表貢獻了具體的意見，今後的問題，乃在如何執行和貫澈這一政策。最後，我們要喚起國人對邊疆的重視，和協助政府與邊地同胞新的邊彊政策之實施。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　洪流中的涓滴</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕置身於廿一日的會塲里，使人感到自己的渺小。這八百五六十件提案如大江洪流，浩蕩而來，敎人手不暇翻，目不暇擊，耳不暇聽，一個上午，會塲里人聲鬨鬨，像電影開映前的塲面。洪秘書長：「第××號×代表××等××人提：案由…審査意見…」，薛主席：「各位代表對於本案審査意見有無異議？…」這樣子的報吿，到十二點才把第二，第三兩審委會處理的有關國防外交提案第一批五十二件的審查報吿全部通過；但在散會時，會塲裏的代表已少了四分之一。</p>
<p>下午更糟：訛不喜歡春天的玄武湖，靈谷寺，陵園…？因此偌大的會堂里，顯得冷淸淸，原定三點錡續開大會，等到三點五十三分還祗有一一八七位，出席代表旣不足法定人數，第一位女主席沈慧蓮便宣吿改開談話會，非正式的進行討論第四審委會有關經濟的提案的審査報吿，不想馬上便在「限期實行耕者有其田，立即開徵累進財產稅…」的案子上拋了銷，陝西何光舉和工會李鴻儒都反對六個月裏要作如此重要的事，認爲限期恐怕要被事實變成具文；於是召集人祝平，高信來個說明修正意見，沈主席說：「我們表決」，有人高喊：「法定人數不够」，沈主席無辦法中想出辦法：「我們來作一個假定的表決好不好」？湊巧的是，接着出席代表居然便增加到一五五八人，已足法定人數；洪秘書長和沈主席連忙改告改開大會，假定的表決變成了正式的表決，修正意見一一打銷。惟一和午前不同的是台下有兩個代表熟心的唱和，一聲聲高呌「無異議」，但到經濟提案第一批五十七件全部通過，沈主席已喘吁吁了。</p>
<p>報吿員一口氣讀過第五組審委會社會安全提案七十三件，台上祇賸下沈主席，雀副秘書長和秘書處楊副處長，台下還有六百多人在捧塲，够累了的沈主席說：「爲了節省時間，好不好把方才讀過的報吿，整個的徵求大家同意，有無異議」？偏偏一位女代表胡魁生跑出來說，某案審査意見文字欠妥，沈主席忙說：「對不起，請不要再講話，有意見補個書面修正好吧？謝謝，謝謝」！情商終於有效。　第六組審委會敎育文化提案一一六件匆匆地讀了整個通過，但請求發言的提出了指責，從樓座里喊起：「主席爲甚麼不准人發言」？沈主席連說「不敢」，洪蘭友，崔心一趕忙請湖北王義周，福建林紫貴等分就教育，文化案件發抒意見，把審查報告作幾處文字修改，在六點鐘快到時，席間不滿兩百人，大部份人已把晚報的廣吿看遍，站起來準備要跑，沈主席急得兩手直招，一連聲「謝謝」，「對不起，請等一等」！以三脚作併兩步地把會議趕忙結束宣吿散會。這時休息室裏領鈔票的代表和咖啡室裏作東道的代表，也都趕忙拿起皮包踱出會堂，上了交通車去赴宴，每個副總統候選人和幹部們也正動身離開他們的熱閙的競選總部，再一度的含笑折腰：一請賜一票」！</p>
<p>八百多提案全部讀過，至少也得三四天，代表們各有興趣，該爭該吵的早已在審査會爭吵過，大會不過照議程把手續了了，大家除了念道會後常設機構如何設立，委員是否有俸外，就祗還有要投副總統的票，更何况這不過是春天，怎怪代表寥寥？（四月廿一日于南京）</p>

<h3>義總選結果正式揭曉　政府黨控制議會　移轉注意力於防共煽亂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：羅馬訊，內政部長賽爾巴宣布，基督敎民主黨在新議會之參衆兩院中，均已獲絕對多數。但觀察家認爲參院之多數，僅屬相對的。賽氏於作此項宣佈時，顯未顧及在選舉前即已決定之一百〇七席名譽參議員。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿一日電〕內政部發表參院選舉之最後正式結果，基督民主黨共獲一〇·七四一·一三一票，佔總額百分之四七·九，人民陣綫共獲六·九五五·二二九票，佔百分之卅一。參院共有議員三四四席，其中一〇七席係爲酬謝對共和國有功之人而被指定者，其餘二三七席則係由此次選舉而產生者。根據開票結果，基督民主黨可望取得一一六至一一八席，人民陣綫可望取得七五至七七席，社會統一黨可望取得十二至十四席，國家集團黨可望取得十二至十四席，共和黨取得七席，帝制然五席，義大利社會運動兩席，獨立派兩席。在指定之參議員中，基督民主黨佔有十八席，故該黨在參院中共可獲得一三四至一三六席。</p>
<p>在衆院的選舉中，根據最近之數字，基督民主然已獲有九·五五四·六一四票，佔總額百分之四八·五，距離過半數的絕對多數已僅百分之一·五，人民陣綫獲六·三三〇·六一四票，佔總額百分之三二·一。衆院議員共五七四席，全係民選，就已知之票數推算，基督民主黨已獲有二七四至二七九席，較該黨在制憲議會中之席數，預料至少可多七十席。人民陣綫根據已知之數字，可獲一九四至一九六席，預料在最後結果宣布後，人民陣綫在衆院中之席數，可與在制憲議會中相等。社會統一黨估計可獲四十至四十一席，國家集團黨可獲十七至二十席，共和黨十四至十六席，帝制黨十二至十三席，義大利社會運動十至十一席，其他估計可獲五席。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿一日電〕義大利政府對選舉勝利旣有把握，已移轉共注意力於防止可能發生之共黨騷擾，及以北部工業區爲中心之大動亂。戰鬥機及陸上部隊業已被派遣至左翼分子集中之各山地偵査。政府並下令禁止共黨星期日之大遊行。同時復公佈當日米蘭將有軍隊檢閱之儀式，以慶祝義大利自軸心統治下獲得自由之週年紀念。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿一日電〕義大選局勢甫經揭曉，全國喘息方定，而北部及南部又於廿一日發生暴亂。南部福奇亞區，共產份子舉行大示威，抗議政府選舉「舞弊」，軍警出動以催淚彈企圖驅散行列，騷動始自昨晚至今晨未止，受傷者已有十人。米蘭區又有軍火庫兩座被襲擊，兵士一人受傷，米蘭軍方稱，米蘭及熟諾亞區之軍憲已奉命戒備，局勢「緊張」。</p>
<h3>義人民陣綫動搖　左翼社會黨難免再分裂</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿一日電〕由共黨左翼社會黨及勞工民主黨合組之人民陣綫，因在大選中遭受慘敗，已開始崩潰。左翼社會黨領袖六人在前內長羅密泰領導下，向社會黨魁南尼提出要求，主張該黨退出左翼同盟，彼等揚言不惜第三次分裂該黨。按南尼於一九四七年一月率領社會黨參加親共聯盟後，已有兩次分裂。現任獨立社會黨領袖之薩拉迦特首次退出該黨，其後兩月社會黨中在國內外最飲時譽之領袖倫巴圖亦吿脫黨。</p>
<p>羅密泰等六人稱，彼等巳函吿南尼將於下星期日舉行會議，決定「恢復本黨獨立」之方針。政治觀察家認爲六人不致立即脫黨，然如南尼堅不願與共黨脫離同盟關係，社會黨必將分裂，此舉顯將削弱共產集團在議會中之力量，蓋新獲選之左翼社會黨人數名必將退出也。、</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿一日電〕共黨副秘書長號稱義共黨「軍事領袖」之泰索氏，今日在米蘭語報界稱，余恐政府與人民間之關係不久將進入危險的緊張狀態，選舉結果並非表示共黨之末日，僅爲共黨計劃之略受挫折。羅馬共黨人士對選舉結果殊露窘態，就共黨及左翼份子之反響觀，參加共產情報局之歐洲共黨，似尙不及議定共同行動的方式，共黨報紙謂義共此次所獲票數已較一九四六年增加百分之十八·五。</p>
<h3>義共遭重大打擊　華府表滿意</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日合衆電〕美官員認爲義反共派在此次選舉中所獲之大勝利，爲對「冷仗」中之蘇聯及國際共黨之最劇烈之打擊。若干人士認爲義國此次選舉結果所予共黨之打擊，較馬歇爾援歐計劃更鉅。義人民此一抉擇，實將增强全球反共派之力量。共黨勢力日增之中，韓·奧·希·德·土·伊朗·中東·斯坎的那維亞及拉丁美洲各國，俱將受此次選舉之影響。</p>

<h3>倫敦巴黎　反應良好</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿日電〕倫敦政界人士除共黨外，對義大利選舉之結果，一致感覺滿意。邱吉爾「幕後內閣」閣員埃夫爵士表示此一現象與西歐聯盟極爲有利，係表示西歐國家之共同信仰基督主義，精神自由及公理。工黨左翼領袖克洛斯曼稱，共黨之敗，雖爲西歐復興所需，然吾人亦不能視加斯貝利之勝利即爲英國之勝利。今後任務在眞正協助義人，建立可使眞正民主社會運動得以生長的社會環境。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿日電〕法國人民共和黨今日致電義大利基督民主黨，祝賀其競選之成功，許曼總理吿路透社記者稱，「法義兩國有共同的文化及共同的志願，義大利基督民主黨之勝利，係象徵兩國間之和平及兩國間之愉快合作」。保守系之「世界日報』認爲托格里亞蒂之最嚴重錯誤，在抨擊梵蒂岡而不能彌補地觸犯了義大利人民的宗敎感情。</p>
<h3>六國會議討論　組西德政府　美準備草擬方案</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿一日電〕戰時總理邱吉爾今日宣稱，亞細亞人，帝國主義及共產黨一日統治中歐與東歐，歐洲將一日不能有永久和平。除非歐洲人民團結一致保全其自由，文化及以基督敎倫理學爲根據之文明，否則世界必無希望可言。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會紛紛反對　美託管聖地計劃　英軍下令撤離海發要港</h3>

<h3>公用事業是否再漲　牽涉問題甚廣　月底方可明朗</h3>

<p>昨日紗市，先疲後堅，結果榮辱互見。初開承上日之疲風，在軟檔徘徊，四二支藍鳳晨開爲二億三千二百萬，廿一支雙馬自一億五千萬關開出，嗣以謠傳紗布南運有開放之說，人心一度振作，奈以本街實銷依然未見起色，客銷去化仍呆，市價欲升乏力。迨至臨收，仍吿回降。前者以二億三千四百萬收市，續挫一百萬。四十支除藍鳳略升一百萬外，餘均續跌一百萬。後者因客帮略有吸收，價吿回振，以一億五千五百萬收盤，回升四百萬。二十支各級除金鷄及紅魁星稍見軋跌外，餘均回堅一百萬至五百萬不一。十六支各級供求相埒，趨勢平穩，鮮見變化。</p>
<p>棉布市况，昨轉入盤局，漢口客帮，僅進小量漂布，及四君子元嗶嘰，士林布及色布染廠供售扔稀，略形俏俐。十二磅龍頭細布晨開爲四九八萬元，一度達五〇二萬元，收市爲四九二萬元。</p>
<p>現棉疲軟</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，趨勢轉軟，花管會納意鬆懈，開價不高，浮多傾吐，市况軟弱。更以紗布實銷不旺，價見回小，人心益形不支。故貨主已不扳價，各檔較上日降低十萬左右，成交五五〇包。德字棉做開二六〇〇萬，沙市二四〇〇萬，火機一八四〇萬，以上均爲送公庫價。周浦籽花價無變動。</p>
<h3>人絲行情軟化</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市因供多求少，行情續呈軟化。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤降至二億三千萬元左右，午收即期做二千九百萬元賣出價，下午收盤價爲三千〇五十萬元，比上日跌落五百萬元弱。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨市仍頗堅硬，高零担做開價三億六千五百萬元，中級零担在六千萬元關內，C字等級討價八千萬元，還價七千五百萬元未曾成交。干經市况甚靜，行情亦然堅站。</p>
<p>綢布</p>
<p>昨市挫降，華強真絲被面，上午開市即降至一億四千六百萬元左右，後再續挫，收市即期做四千四百五十萬元。大誠格子璧縐收市做五十三萬五千元，人造絲貨昨均疲軟。華錦縐普通貨十七萬元關內有成交，眞絲貨均吿堅穩。</p>

<h3>對日貿易貨欠帳　中信發表聲明</h3>
<p>我駐日代表團貿易組代表唐菊生在日發表談話，謂中日貿易幾陷僵局之主要原因，爲中央信託局對日易貨拖欠帳款未能淸理，並有將債務撥爲日本對華賠償一部份之建議云云。中信局負責人昨特對此發表聲明，加以辯正。據稱：（一）該局辦理對日易貨，與私人對日貿易各不相關，原係各別進行。當政府開放對日私人貿易時，該局即建議政府將私人貿易賬目分開，故該局易貨賬務，決不妨碍私人貿易。（二）該局對日易貨所欠日方共一千萬美元，現正由各該局將國內貨物積極運日償付淸理，目前待運之貨物，至少在一百萬美元以上，正在陸續起運。該負責人鄭重聲稱，欠日帳款並非丟臉事，因當易貨開始之初，日方即欠該局相當數目，况戰勝各國對日易貨，可先取貸然後以貸抵淸，早有此規定。故欠帳純為易貨雙方之事，與普通貿易無關。（三）該局決無意將債務撥充日本對華賠償一部份之意，至今旣未向政府建議，亦無向盟軍總部要求云。</p>
<h3>實銷不旺供過於求　米市稍形回降　粉糧油餅均一致挫軟</h3>
<p>昨日米市，南市平疲，北市削低五萬元，南市塲於晨開時，，曾因隔日無錫價漲，故亦提升十萬元，旋以去路臺無，市乃虛而轉降，貨主欲脫而乏對手，中途即見回退，終與上日價相仿，收市且或稍疲。獨白元貨缺價漲十萬元。北市塲粳薄稻秈米，一致以銷懈而降五萬元。白元及特高粳各堅站原盤，到貨共五千五百九十三石，民調會續在北市場開售白米，但亦少去路。</p>
<p>麵粉重入疲境，原因為化帮又告歇手，蘇錫價疲，執主甚感心虛，相繼脫手，客帮整化旣無，本街零化亦不多，供多於求，價乃步降，兵船粉由一百四十二萬，至收市價退爲一百四十萬元。老車退入一百四十萬關內，計跌三萬及四萬五千元。紅蜂，建成，均挫三萬。麩皮回退三萬元，小麥廠盤加二萬，爲二百〇七萬元。</p>

<p>食油勁跌，因原料價低，各糧俱現疲落，執主心軟，吐售甚多，油廠乘高開出，供應充沛。大有大昌新豆油廠開八百六十萬，後回籠交易再短，最低同甡泰豆油爲八百四十五萬，約降三十萬。生油實銷不多，疾降三四萬。淸油生菜油同吿降落，豆餅客帮不取，價跟油市劇瀉三四萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市上落狹窄</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，向以出口爲主之平水珠茶，自吐納談判陷於僵持後，交易迄未明朗，而市氣則迭轉炫耀。其他花色，授受亦極狹窄，市程缺乏變遷，至於內銷茶，各色陳茶在存底空虛中，依然巍站如昔，他若本年度新龍井，猶以到源踵接，品質日形蒼老，支持益感無力，臨收復再比前軋低。茲據業中人云：洞庭山所產之碧螺春，亦屬名貴之內銷茶，本年度新貨，目前漸屆摘製之期，大致不久即將蒞滬獻新。</p>

<h3>刀下留人！</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>勝利初期，央行開放外匯，並定爲無限制供給，幣値賴以穩定，物價波動得以减少，且有下跌之象。當時頗有些名流巨子，鑒於手頭商品貨物無形貶値，而老百姓竟稍獲喘息機會，乃以「保陣民族工商業」爲由，提倡「高物價政策」，此唱彼和，鼓吹得然鬧非凡。二年來物價節節高漲，步步上升，雖爲大勢所促成，未必全係此輩倡導之功，然一般人民生活愈加困苦，此輩之財富則愈積愈多，却爲事實。時至今日，「高物價政策」可謂已經完成。只是月來物價，雖仍不免時起波折，但似較前已稍平穩，誠恐向之反對漲風之輿論，經別有用心者之挑撥鼓動，又一變而提倡「高物價政策」。此非筆者神經過敏，事實上已經有人惴惴自危，在發「漲價誠不好，跌價也不妥」的高論了。一旦美貸予以有效利用，物價略呈下跌之勢，「高物價」論者之發動攻勢，乃爲意料中事。屆時此輩爲謀避免商品跌價計，至少必將散播「經濟宜求穩定」一類冠冕堂皇的論調。</p>
<p>按情理說，漲價旣不好，跌價便應名之曰好。物價跌即是法幣增値，購買力提高；平穩論者無非企求苟延殘喘，使手頭囤貨保持原値，重圖再漲耳。物價普遍下跌，與生產廠商初無影響，蓋出品固貶價，原料工資方面之成本亦同時得以减輕；受打擊者只是坐享其成不勞而獲的囤貨階級，而受其利者乃是一般信任法幣的老百姓。故老百姓無有不望物價下跌者，而高物價論者之心目中則最好能求指數凍結，而物價則無時不機動調整。</p>
<p>今日全國盛倡民主政治，竊思欲求政治之民主，必先謀經濟之民主，幸希決策當局以多數民衆之利益爲重，萬勿於米價或別的商品價格稍有下跌之象，方將回復於漲風前十餘天之價格之時，即往市塲收購，自充中流砥柱，一如挽狂瀾於旣倒者然，務懇不要如此，幸甚幸甚。</p>
<h3>略談煙墨</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>凌霄漢閣購得紫墨一塊，有「人磨墨墨磨人」字樣，而發咬文嚼字之歎。實則磨用之墨，決非佳墨，墨亦並不磨人，人之衰老，人自衰老之耳，於墨乎何與！</p>
<p>按上古之時，書用漆，中古之時，書用石墨，後世書用烟墨。自烟墨發明，遂有各家墨法之分，若韋仲將，冀公，祖氏，李超，李廷珪，潘谷諸家，賡續不絕。六朝無過張永，五季無過奐超。奚超之子，即李廷珪（南唐時賜姓爲李），所造烟墨，置之水中，三年不壞，稱爲墨中神品。其後有蘇浩然製墨，皆作松紋皺皮，堅緻如玉，至金章宗，乃以蘇合油搜烟爲之，墨價與黄金同値。</p>
<p>六朝以後，有李承晏，李文用，陳贇，盛浩諸人，所製墨，皆類廷珪，亦爲墨中神品。至唐玄宗御用墨，稱爲龍香劑，一日，見墨上有小道士如蠅而行，玄宗叱之，呼萬歲，曰，臣墨之精，黑松使者也。此未免近於神話。但晋唐之書，宋元之畫，皆傳數百年，墨色如漆，神氣純全，決非後來作品所可比並。古人云，墨妙在於質輕，烟取其淸，嗅之無香，磨之無聲，斯爲上品。宋宣和間，李廷珪墨價過黄金，黄金可得，而李墨不可得也。</p>
<p>明萬歷天啓時，製墨最有名者，程君房，方于魯，吳去塵三人最善，與方正，邵格之，羅小華諸家，後先輝映，直至程用修爲止，代有作家。然古用松煤，後則用桐油烟，鹿膠亦多不用，均用牛膠，質地已降，遠不逮古人矣。</p>
<p>大抵墨之佳者，其質必輕而膠必重，色黑如點漆而發光，作畫寫字，可以爲精神上之一助。昔華亭董其昌，最講究用墨，特聘有名墨工，在家自製，選烟特別細，滲膠特別光，故其書畫，傳之千百年，而盛彩不退。淸王麓台作畫，亦非頂烟不輕下筆，古人蓋於用墨一道，三致意焉。</p>
<p>余在北平時，常州袁珏生藏墨最多，著有中舟藏墨錄，當時藏墨者推爲巨擘。然袁君書法甚工，用墨亦屬普通，其女公子皆能作山水畫而名不著，可知袁君以收藏古墨爲主旨，不在用墨之良否爲研求也。今袁君已歸道山，其所藏墨不知歸落何處，亦無人能明之。收藏家取快一時，書畫家流傳千古，同爲寳貴佳墨，而不能相提並論也。</p>
<p>史載「唐時，馮盛與盧杞相遇於途，各携一囊，杞發盛囊，有墨一枚，把大笑。盛正色曰：此天都峯煤，和鍼魚腦，入金豁子手中造作而成，可以錄離騷古本，比公日提綾文刺三百，爲名利奴，顧當孰勝！已而搜杞囊，果是三百刺。」以此見藏墨比之奔走名利場者，差勝多矣。</p>

<h3>且慢〔不給〕</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>人窮至於流爲乞丐，雖屬社會的寄生蟲，至可鄙　，但我們人類究竟是有同情心的，不能眼看他們餓死，所以當我們碰到乞丐，尤其是殘疾老稚的，少不得要做做好事，破費一兩張鈔票。</p>
<p>乞丐的成因，並不完全由於懶惰，在國泰民安的時候，多半由於智能低下，在戰亂頻扔的時候，不知有多少乞丐是砲火造成的。幸而不淪爲乞丐的我們，要是不給一點飯他們吃，他們豈不是只有死路一條？硬心腸的人，無所謂，死一個乞丐等於死一條狗罷了，可是軟心腸的人，死一條狗也是難過一的，何况乎人？</p>
<p>要是人人不給乞丐的錢，那就可能有兩種後果：其一是返歸自然——餓死；其二是挺而走險——逼爲扒手，小偷，甚至强盜土匪之流。我認爲，理想的社會，首先應圖謀無盜賊，其次圖謀無乞丐，讓乞丐苟延殘喘，或可防丐爲盜，如不給乞丐留一條生路，便足逼他上梁山了。</p>
<p>十八日本報載，社會局爲了防止上海成爲「乞丐之城」，已有人擬聯合各界名流發起倡導「不給運動」。並且據聞：「若輩乞丐，每日呌化所得可二三十萬元，其收入之佳，令人咋舌。」聽起來，果然令人昨舌，但我懷疑。乞丐收入有如此之佳，恐不見得。此種懷疑雖無科學的根據，彼種據聞又豈有確切的證明？</p>
<p>如此豪華富貴美麗幸福的大上海，若成爲「乞丐之城」，誠然「有碍市容，亦且影響公共衛生與社會治安」，問題是應如何使乞丐變爲非乞丐，防非乞丐成爲乞丐。問題沒有解決之前，「不給運動」且慢發動爲妙。</p>
<h3>酒德篇</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>劉伶的「酒德頌」固然拿酒贊美到絕頂，孟東野「酒德詩」說：「酒是古明鏡，輾開小人心，醉見異舉止，醉聞異聲音；酒功如是多，酒屈亦以深。罪人免罪酒，如此可爲箴。」也確有至理。跟人一起喝酒鬥牌，往往能從一微小的舉動裏，見到一人家的眞脾氣眞性情。尤其是喝酒醉了之後，平素沈默的人，也會多說多話了；貌爲溫文爾雅的人，也會粗暴妄爲了。古人說：「酒能亂性。」其實酒最能令人顯出本性，的確是人心的明鏡。有許多人是存心不飲酒的，雖是他們也很愛酒。嚴白雲說得好：「奸人多不飲，城府如谿山，鈎銛醉中語，飾貌僞往還。毒哉斯人心！飲中勿與言。」</p>
<p>我是一個酒徒，一杯在手，陶然自樂。醉後狂歌狂笑，與人披肝瀝膽。有一次狂笑的結果，下頷竟脫下，現在變成毛病，一不小心，還時時要脫下，然而畢竟遇到了幾位酒中至友可與共患難。但是爲了多喝酒，身體却一天一天的衰弱；醉後狂言，也得罪了許多人。好幾次也竟爲人所「鈎銛」，跌入「陷馬坑」，　到「衆叛親離」，無法收拾；然而我畢竟對「杯中物」悠然神往。泗的本身是好的，而且是奇妙的，只怪我不能好好地駕馭牠。但牠苟其被「奸人」所利用，那纔糟糕；下蒙汗藥還是顯而易見的作惡，老江湖可以一見即辨：「飾貌僞往還」，那眞可怕，不但要你性命財物，而且要使你身敗名裂。使酒駡座的人那纔可愛，十九是性情中人物。所以我說：「酒是情感的東西，烟是理智的東西。」你看：慣用心計的人，常是口不離烟的；抽大烟的枕上工夫更是可怕。所以我始終贊美酒，雖是我現在竟病得不能喝酒了。</p>
<p>「酒功如是多，酒屈亦以深。」我替酒表功，我替酒叫屈。</p>
<h3>禹廟</h3>
<p>— 散木</p>
<p>夾江高峙越王都，丹雘崇塘半刦餘，玉陛草隨殘甲長，（時屯復員靑年軍）豐碑書被野人鉏；山川輸貢關天下，　蹕時巡望太初，極目浮雲勞北顧，黄流今日已成渠！</p>
<p>自禹　拏舟訪小雲梄　登嫩雲樓日云暮矣</p>
<p>嫩雲窩外暮雲遮，一片荒寒壓水涯，末刦未殘僧敗道，樓前閒殺萬梅花。</p>
<h3>兒童村</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>在瑞士屈樓經附近的山麓有一塊五萬平方碼的小村子，散佈着二十四幢紅松茅屋。每一幢房子裏住着一羣不同國籍的孤兒，這就是柏塔羅西兒章村。兒童村的最大宗旨並不在於使受盡戰爭摧殘的孤兒離鄒得到身體上的營養，而在於營養他們的靈魂，使他們了解人與人之間的和平與愛</p>
<p>兒童村的誕生是一個夢想的實現。在一九四四年夏季，瑞士一份月刋的編輯華脫·勞伯特·考蒂寫了一篇社論，呼籲爲世界的戰爭孤兒設立一座避難所。</p>
<p>響應使考蒂驚訝。塡滿了錢和建議的信件成千而來。他便組織了一個「兒童村協會」，在計劃實現之前，他曾向幾位建築家，教育家，和心理學家討敎過。</p>
<p>地址選定之後，瑞士的兒童爲了雄立兒童村，曾在大街小巷募過捐，有兩個小兄弟將擦皮鞋所得捐了出來，學生犧牲假日來鋸木頭，七百個工人義務的做了八萬小時工。</p>
<p>二十四幢房子築好了。傢具，樓梯，窗戶和門柄的高度都設計得適於兒童使用。每幢房子可住十六個兒童，由「房父」和「房母」各一人照管。</p>
<p>曾經幹地下工作的法國兒童來到這裏之後，知道沒有暴動也能够生活。來自德國的小女孩不再在半夜醒來呼喚她的早已死去的父母。曾經發誓與匈牙利人不共戴天的波蘭孩子，如今却在與他的「仇敵」做朋友了。</p>
<p>兒意村的最大的成就是使猶有餘悸的戰爭孤兒安靜下來，在他們的心田中撒下「世界大同」的種子。</p>

<h3>蘇東坡的玉帶</h3>
<p>— 筱彭</p>
<p>本報載金山寺此次火災，該寺古蹟，如周鼎，諸葛銅鼓，蘇東坡玉帶等物，均免於難，亦云幸矣。昔年東坡所留之王帶，尙有一段趣事，茲述之如：</p>
<p>原來，宋時金山寺住持爲佛印禪師，他是東坡的空門友，東坡赴杭州的時候，路過潤州（鎭江），在金山寺住了幾個月，一天，佛印掛牌，領着他的弟子入室，東坡便服入方丈見他。佛印道：「內翰何來？此間無處坐。」東坡戲道：「借和尙四大，用作禪牀。」佛印道：「山僧有一轉語，內翰言下即答，當從所請，如稍涉擬議，所繫玉帶，願留以鎭山門。」東坡許之，便解下玉帶，蹬几上。佛印道：「山僧四大本無，五蘊非有，內翰欲於何處坐？」東坡擬議未即答，佛印急呼侍者道：「收此玉帶，永鎭山門。」東坡笑而與之。佛印取衲裙相報，並有二絕。東坡次韻答之，句云：「病骨難堪玉帶圍，鈍根仍落箭鋒機。欲敎乞食歌姬院，故與雲山舊衲衣。」讀此，想見當年坡老風趣。今此玉帶，未遭殃及，果能永鎭山門矣。</p>
<h3>苓</h3>
<p>讀報知國大花外，又有「國大之后」伍雲格勒女士。此種熱鬧，亦屬歐風。昔年固有許多「菲島皇后當選」，「巴黎皇后加冕一云云突，至於各市各校之選后，與選市花，選校花，同義而異名，惟中國之「后」與西文之Queen，不無異同，易滋疑義。昔年平市西郊大學之校后選出後，許多男生譁笑紛紛，自稱「皇帝」，雖是游戲，而字義益　，是不可以無說。</p>
<p>「后」字古訓即是君主，從體之君，所謂「后者後也」，本不屬於女性，迭見書易各經，夏商以前皆然。周始以「后」稱歸於天子之配偶。（在此以前，天子之妻只曰妃，妃者配也。）乃有皇后以匹皇帝，皇太后以並太上皇。</p>
<p>爲宮中之主，其下則有妃有嬪有貴人等等，北面以事后，如王公列爵，對皇帝爲臣也。皇帝之親伯叔兄弟，雖貴爲親王，對皇后亦爲臣下，故皇后仍與皇帝一體。然而無論如何，她總是有夫之婦，不離「妻以夫貴」「夫爲妻　一的那一套，沒有獨立爲尊的資格。</p>
<p>西國之Queen則不然。雖是女性且與King　爲對，稱然King之妻爲Queen，而Queen之夫則不必爲King。英國之維多利亞，伊麗沙白，皆爲一國之主，並非因King而Queen。此外如荷蘭等國之女主，其夫亦不能因妻之爲Queen，即自居於King。又如第一次世界大戰時，暴德之威廉亦曾蹂躪北歐，荷蘭倖免，譯電云因荷蘭女王的駙馬是德國人，得其聯絡疏通之力。按此「駙馬」二字亦沿中國，甚屬勉强。女王之夫，固非帝王，亦非「駙馬』，只能按他本人的職分，給他應有的稱呼。</p>
<p>中國歷史上所謂「女主」雖當大權當國多年，如唐武則天，淸那拉氏，亦都是因夫爲帝王，聯帶而捧起。武則天雖自立「周刺」，改后爲帝，亦與西方Queen根本不同。日本之皇室名稱大致因襲中國之舊，但女子亦封「王」（有內親王及女王等級）。其皇室典範規定天皇缺位時之攝政先儘太子及各級王，男子無及歲及格之人選，則輪到內親王，再次爲女王，女王之次爲皇后，最後乃輪到皇太后。雖有此具文，決無此事實。中國歷史上皇帝缺席，就有個一太后老佛爺」或垂簾聽政，或指揮一切，居之不疑，皇女之輩只能稱公主，無問國事資格。日本之內親王，女王，雖不能正式承統，却有「攝政」之條文（次序在后之上，重血梳不重匹敵），其性質介乎西方之Queen與中國之公主之間。</p>
<p>市后也，校后也，會后也，爲免誤解起見，以譯女王爲宜。</p>
<p>英國兩個鼎鼎大名之「后」，皆關係第一强國之劃時代的繁榮。伊麗沙白以絕代容華之美女，南面稱尊，國家鼎盛，百業茂昌。文豪如沙士比亞，倍根，斯實塞耳，皆於此時代顯其聲名，詩歌，戲曲，科學，無不發達。維多利亞在位時，國力特强，由英之王而兼印度之皇（Einhress），爲大不列顚創始國權擴大之新紀元。故西俗之一般的選花選后，亦具有繁榮强盛之象徵，而非只爲起　一時，熟鬧一陣，此義亦不可不明。</p>

<p>法律譯疑</p>
<p>三十年前舊事　房屋典贖問題</p>
<p>孫憲鈞問　鄙人有法律問題數則，請賜答為感。（一）鄙人於民二年受典某姓房屋一所，典契並未載明年限，如根據民法則受典屆滿卅年後，出典人回贖權即吿消滅，然不知抗戰期間，是否扣除八年？（一）隨契取得之房屋收租摺，下半節已於戰時毁損，惟幸載有註筆之上節租摺首端尙完好無損，如此情形，不知將被認爲證件有瑕疵而無效否？</p>
<p>〔法律顧問唐鳴時先生答〕</p>
<p>（一）抗戰軍興，各地淪陷有先後，而法權行使受阻礙亦各不同，不能一概以八年計算也。如司法權不能行使，確屬一種理由。但情節須有證明，例如雙方若同在一地，有否曾爲回贖之切實表示？典權人是否拒絕？等等，不可一槪論也。（二）審認證據，須看實物原件，不能測度，如不完全，即屬瑕疵，惟有瑕疵之證據，並非全無證據力也。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Successfully Passes Proposals Covering National Defense, Diplomacy, Economy, Society, Culture, and Education; Approximately 300 Items Sent to the Government for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The National Assembly entered the proposal discussion stage on the 21st. The 14th session of the Assembly was held at 9:40 AM, presided over by Xue Yue from the ninth group of the presidium. 2,035 representatives were present. The minutes of the 12th session, the Presidential election session, and the 13th session were read. The secretariat reported on congratulatory and leave requests. The presidium reported on (1) the official announcement of the Vice Presidential candidates according to the law, and (2) the Assembly will no longer accept petitions.</p>
<p>Then, the discussion of the proposals began. Because the review report of the first review committee was awaiting a decision from the presidium, it was not presented for discussion in the morning. The review reports of the second review committee, consisting of 44 cases, and the review report of the third review committee, consisting of personal cases, were smoothly passed before and after the break. There were only two speeches: one was a proposal to condemn the Communist Party via a telegram from the Assembly, calling on all compatriots to support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, with Guo Hongqun from Hebei advocating for its passage and implementation by the Assembly; the other was a proposal to abolish the Sino-Soviet Aviation Treaty, with the original proposer, Yang Yongyi from Xinjiang, explaining the main points of the proposal.</p>
<p>As for the review report of the fourth review committee, consisting of 57 cases, after being read, due to time constraints, it was postponed for discussion in the afternoon. The session adjourned at 11:55 AM.</p>
<p>Important proposals passed in the morning related to national defense included: (1) thoroughly investigating the dereliction of duty by commanding officers during the retreat from Jilin; (2) simplifying anti-banditry agencies in various regions and strengthening their authority; (3) strengthening the jurisdiction and powers of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters; and (4) promptly dispatching a large army to rescue the critical situation in the Northeast. All were in accordance with the review opinions and recommended that the government earnestly implement them.</p>
<p>Those related to diplomacy included: (1) formally informing the Soviet Union in the name of the Assembly to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty and, upon its expiration, independently announce the abolition of the Yalta Agreement and the Sino-Soviet Treaty; and (2) determining the principles for a peace treaty with Japan. All were in accordance with the review opinions and were separately sent to the government for earnest implementation and adoption.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The National Assembly continued its 14th session on the afternoon of the 21st. It was delayed until 3:53 PM, and the number of representatives present was still only 1,187, which was less than the legal quorum. It was changed to a discussion meeting, presided over by Shen Huilian, marking the first time a female representative has served as chair of the Assembly since its opening. After the meeting began, the review report of the fourth review committee, which had been read in the morning, was discussed. By 4:20 PM, the number of representatives present had reached 1,558, meeting the legal quorum. The Assembly was then reconvened, and the three cases that had already been discussed were ratified retroactively. Subsequently, the 57 cases in the review report of the fourth review committee were passed one by one. The review reports of the fifth and sixth review committees, totaling 189 cases, were read separately. The chair sought the Assembly's consent to pass them all without individual discussion. The passage was smooth and uneventful. Only in the review report of the sixth review committee, regarding cases related to rescuing youth, border regions, overseas Chinese education, as well as cultural and news undertakings, did the proposers make slight supplements or revisions to the review opinions. With the chair's consent, the Assembly agreed to the corrections. The session adjourned at 6:10 PM. In total, 298 proposals were passed throughout the day, which was considered very rapid.</p>
<p>Among the important cases passed in the afternoon, those concerning the national economy included: (1) formulating measures to requisition the capital of wealthy families within three months and implementing them earnestly; (2) fully implementing land reform; (3) exempting grain from business tax; and (4) establishing a currency reform committee to draft a currency reform plan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Those concerning social security included: (1) earnestly carrying out relief efforts; (2) banning opium and narcotics; (3) defining agricultural policies; (4) earnestly protecting women's employment; (5) expanding children's welfare undertakings; and (6) rescuing skilled workers.</p>
<p>Those concerning education and culture included: (1) rescuing out-of-school and unemployed youth in bandit-controlled areas; (2) determining educational funding; (3) improving the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants; (4) developing Hui (Muslim) education; (5) emphasizing labor education; and (6) supporting news publishing and cultural undertakings, as well as cases related to overseas Chinese education and border region education.</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Suggests the Government Simplifies Bandit Suppression Agencies; The Proposal to Condemn the Communist Party via Telegram is Handed to the Presidium for Handling</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The National Assembly passed the "Proposal to Simplify Bandit Suppression Agencies in Various Regions and Strengthen Their Authority" on the morning of the 21st, suggesting that the government earnestly implement it. The main points of the measures are as follows: (1) Simplify the bandit suppression command structure. A unified bandit suppression command structure must be established in the bandit suppression area, and all duplicate agencies must be abolished. (2) Coordinate and strengthen local armed forces. In areas without bandits or where bandits have retreated, local security should be the responsibility of local militias. However, their organization and training must be strengthened in advance, their equipment must be replenished, and their security must be planned in advance to prevent them from being hijacked by bandits. (3) The central government should relax the scale of laws and regulations. Temporary emergency policies can be formulated in the bandit suppression area. (4) Civil officials in the bandit area, from the provincial chairman and mayor, and military officials from the army commander and commanders of military districts, are under the command of the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression. (5) The agencies and schools under the central ministries should cooperate with the decrees of the bandit suppression headquarters to perform their duties. If the person in charge is incompetent, the central government may be requested to replace them.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The National Assembly passed a resolution on the morning of the 21st to condemn the Communist Party via telegram in the name of the Assembly and to call on all compatriots to support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. The proposals were: (1) proposed by Gao Zhongqian and others: The Communist Party is creating chaos with soldiers, harming the country and the people. Please send a telegram to the whole country and the world to denounce and punish them, so as to expose their atrocities and launch a nationwide attack. The measures are: 1. Send a telegram to the whole country in the name of the Assembly to denounce them. 2. Send a telegram to the world in the name of the Assembly to expose the Communist Party's conspiracy and crimes, so as to avoid being deceived by the Communist Party's false propaganda and correct international perceptions. (2) Proposed by Gao Zhongqian and others: Please send a telegram to the whole country from this Assembly to call on all compatriots to unanimously support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, step up the implementation of general mobilization, so as to quickly quell the rebellion and consolidate the foundation of the country. The measures are: 1. The Assembly shall resolve to hand it over to the future new government to continue to implement the national policy of suppressing the rebellion, so as to achieve complete success. 2. The Assembly shall send a telegram to call on all compatriots and overseas Chinese to continue to unanimously support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, and step up the mobilization to suppress the rebellion, so as to quickly quell the rebellion and consolidate the foundation of the country. The Assembly decided to hand it over to the presidium for handling.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Personnel Will Be Adjusted Immediately</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Meeting May Make a Decision</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] There will be personnel adjustments in Shaanxi Province.

<h3>Grain Business Tax; Pan Gongzhan and Others Propose Exemption</h3>
<p>The National Assembly Formally Approved Yesterday</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The "Proposal by Pan Gongzhan and 50 others requesting the National Government to issue a clear order to exempt grain from business tax, in order to maintain the people's food supply and alleviate the people's plight," was reviewed by the review committee and determined to be approved in principle, and sent to the government to instruct the competent authorities to earnestly implement it. It was approved by the Assembly on the 21st. The reasons for the proposal are that in this critical time of survival, if the people's food supply is not sufficient, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, exempting grain tax is an essential plan to remedy the current difficulties. However, the provinces and cities have different opinions on this. Provinces such as Shandong and Sichuan advocate for a gradual collection, and Shanghai also believes that it should be exempted. Beiping, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Hefei have also gradually exempted grain tax. The overlapping of grain taxation only increases grain prices and is more likely to affect social order. Two measures are proposed: (1) The National Government shall issue a clear order to permanently exempt grain from business tax. (2) The provincial and municipal governments shall not collect grain donations and taxes under any name.</p>
<h3>Currency Reform</h3>
<p>The National Assembly Suggests Adopting the Gold Standard</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] There are a total of four proposals related to currency reform submitted by the National Assembly. One is the "Proposal to Issue New Currency to Stabilize Finance" proposed by Wu Yizhi and 61 others. One is the "Proposal to Reform the Currency System Quickly, Stabilize Finance, and Stabilize People's Hearts" proposed by Mo Shaozhou and 32 others. One is the "Proposal that the Government's Economic Report Believes that the Fundamental Policy to Stabilize Prices and Replenish Military Expenditures Should First Reform the Currency System and Should Be Implemented Regularly" proposed by Song Yuanyuan and 40 others. One is the "Proposal to Quickly Reform the Currency System to Maintain the National Economy and People's Livelihood" proposed by Pei Hongyu and 25 others. After the review committee merged and reviewed the four proposals, it decided to approve them in principle and send them to the government to immediately establish a currency reform committee to draft a plan for implementation as soon as possible. It was passed by the Assembly on the 21st. The measures proposed in Wu's proposal are divided into two phases. In the first phase, the state will allocate materials worth 1.2 billion new currencies to form the National Construction Bank. The National Assembly will form a supervisory committee to be responsible for the custody and supervision of the bank's assets and the supervision of the printing and issuance of the new currency. All representatives of the National Assembly will be responsible for guaranteeing the validity of the new currency. The new currency will adopt the gold exchange standard, with new silver coins as the circulating chips (only banknotes will be issued in the first phase). That is, one new currency equals 100,000 legal currencies, and three new currencies equal one US dollar. 600 million new currencies will be used to recover more than 60 trillion legal currencies, and 600 million yuan will be used for the country to balance revenue and expenditure and for construction. In the second phase, 1.2 billion new silver coins will be issued. Once the coins are issued and cashed smoothly, the supervisory committee of the National Assembly will return them to the government for processing. Mo's proposal also believes that it should be changed to a gold coin as the standard and a silver coin as the auxiliary currency, and a fully convertible legal currency should be issued. Song's proposal only urged the government to promote currency reform as soon as possible to stabilize finance in a questioning manner.</p>
<h3>Requisitioning the Deposits of the Wealthy; Detailed Measures Listed in Three Proposals</h3>

The measures proposed in the three proposals are listed approximately as follows: (1) In the name of the National Assembly, send a telegram to US President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to announce the names and amounts of depositors in the United States, and immediately seal them up; (2) The National Assembly shall, in accordance with the teachings of the National Father on restricting capital, determine the maximum amount of capital for each person, and the excess part shall be confiscated by the government.

<h3>Sun Ke Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations; Vehemently Criticizes the Soviet Union for Not Fulfilling the Treaty; Reaffirms His Firm Stance on Giving Up His Legislative Yuan Qualification</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] Sun Ke met with reporters at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 21st and made an unprecedentedly fierce criticism of the Soviet Union. He said: It is an undeniable fact that the Soviet Union is not fulfilling the treaty, and its excuse for difficulty that the war against Japan still exists is simply unreasonable. Mr. Sun appeared angered after hearing from reporters that a Soviet diplomat had commented that his remarks were unstable and did not believe that his election as vice president would benefit Sino-Soviet relations. He pointed out that after the fall of Anshan, most of the factory machinery had been dismantled and transported to Dalian and then to Vladivostok, accusing the Soviet Union of taking whatever it wanted in the Northeast, acting like a "robber." He did not give a direct answer to the question of whether he would still be willing to work hard to strengthen Sino-Soviet diplomacy and enhance friendship if he was elected vice president. He said: The situation is very clear. Everyone knows what the Northeast representatives of the National Assembly think of the Soviet Union. The future of Sino-Soviet relations depends on whether the Soviet Union has the sincerity to fulfill the treaty and coexist peacefully. He asked, if the positions of China and the Soviet Union were switched, what would the Soviet Union do? He believes that the crushing defeat of the Communist Party in the Italian general election can improve the situation in Western Europe and benefit reconstruction, but he is afraid that Italian society will be disturbed by the Communist Party's direct actions. The Communist Parties of the world are all centered on the Soviet Union, and they first use democracy as an excuse to win over the masses in various countries, but after failing in a regular way, they use any means. Our country's Communist bandits betray the country and create chaos, and they first eliminate resistance everywhere, and then implement policies by force. The government must guarantee the success of suppressing the rebellion with comprehensive political reform.</p>
<p>[Further dispatch] Sun Ke confirmed to reporters on the 21st that he had given up his qualification as a legislator. He said that although it is not yet time for the Legislative Yuan to elect the president, in order to avoid attacks from political enemies, he declared in advance that he would give up his election as a legislator to show his dedication to running for vice president. He also said that his decision to give up his qualification as a legislator will be maintained under any circumstances and will never be reversed. Regarding the constitutional amendment proposed by Zhang Zhiben and others that "National Assembly representatives exercise the rights of initiation and referendum on behalf of the people," he believes that there should be no doubt. The right of referendum is equivalent to a foreign plebiscite, but the right of initiation lacks precedent. The technical issue of how to exercise these two political rights needs to be studied.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren's Opinion on Women's Issues Published</h3>
<p>Please Earnestly Protect Women's Rights and Interests</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Yu Youren, the president of the Control Yuan who is running for vice president, recently published an article "How to Solve the Problems of Chinese Women" to the women representatives of the National Assembly and the women of the whole country, expressing his opinions on the problems of Chinese women. The article is divided into three main points: the first is to solve the problem of women's employment, advocating that women must participate in actual administrative work and the work of various social departments, and the government should earnestly implement the relevant provisions on women's rights and interests after the implementation of the constitution; the second is to solve the problem of women's education, advocating the popularization of women's education, improving their cultural level, and cultivating women's professional talents; and the third is to solve the problem of women's economic problems, emphasizing women's economic freedom and establishing the principle of equal pay for equal work. The conclusion is that in China after the implementation of the constitution, women must demand full equality with men in all aspects of politics, education, economy, and society. It is heard that the women representatives of the National Assembly greatly admire President Yu's powerful statement.</p>
<h3>The Issue of a Permanent Organization</h3>
<p>The National Assembly Presidium Discussed It</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The issue of establishing a permanent organization after the National Assembly adjourns was discussed in detail at the meeting of the Presidium on the evening of the 21st. The original proposers, Liu Jiashu and Jia Guoen, also attended to explain the reasons for the proposal and the necessity of establishing a permanent organization. They then withdrew, and the Presidium began a heated discussion, debating for a long time. Most people believed that the Presidium had no right to change the results of the review committee. Finally, it was decided to submit the first group's review opinions to the Assembly for discussion, and the decision on whether to establish it or not was left to the Assembly. Fang Juehui chaired the meeting of the Presidium on the 21st and decided that Li Zonghuang and Hu Jingan would take turns as chairpersons of the Assembly on the 22nd morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Reviews the Economy</h3>
<p>Representatives Attack the Work of the Fuel Management Committee</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] When the National Assembly held an economic review, the representatives strongly attacked the work of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, especially because the price of coal distributed by the Fuel Management Committee was higher than that on the black market, and the surplus of the 36th year has not yet been handed over to the national treasury, which they were deeply dissatisfied with. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian explained this when answering questions from the representatives on the 21st. Mr. Chen has admitted that the distribution price of Kailuan coal in Shanghai is much higher than the price delivered on ships in Qinhuangdao, but because each ton needs to be charged with railway security fees, Beining Road double-track repair fees, ship usage fees, and Shanghai terminal usage fees, totaling 2,716,000 yuan, the distribution price in Shanghai is 6,990,000 yuan. As for the surplus of more than 130 billion yuan of the Fuel Management Committee last year, Mr. Chen also admitted that it was correct, but said that it was used as a revolving fund for coal storage, so it has not yet been handed over to the national treasury.</p>
<h3>Salaries of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants</h3>

<h3>Zhang Junmai Sends a Telegram to the Chairman; Congratulating Him on His Election as President</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Zhang Junmai, chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, sent a telegram to congratulate Chairman Jiang on his election as President. The telegram read: "Nanjing Chairman Jiang Jian: On the day of the US presidential election, although the two parties competed with each other at the beginning, when the public opinion was revealed, the leaders of the opposition sent telegrams to the government, so as to clarify the purpose of starting a dispute and ending with concessions and obeying the majority. Your hard work and great achievements have led the people and the youth parties to give up nominating candidates, so as to promote your election with an overwhelming majority, which is enough to show the consensus of the psychology.

<h3>Editorial: Future Borderland Policy</h3>
<p>The Seventh Review Committee of the National Assembly held a full-day meeting on the 20th and continued to handle 34 proposals related to the borderlands, resolving to submit them to the government for consideration and implementation. The scope of the proposals is broad, covering borderland administration, the appointment of talented people from various ethnic groups, borderland policy, borderland economic development, as well as borderland education, borderland academic research, and investigation. The spirit of the various proposals is to have the government establish a borderland policy, using new political conduct and new facilities to promote the inward orientation of borderland compatriots and achieve the goal of national unity.</p>
<p>The representatives of this National Assembly came from the plateaus of Kangzang, Yunnan, and Guizhou, and from the deserts of Mongolia and Xinjiang, from the wild forests of Miaoling Mountain; in terms of ethnicity, there were Manchus, Mongols, Hui, Tibetans, Miao, Zhuang, Yao, and Gaoshan ethnic groups. This assembly united the Chinese nation into one family and gathered elites from the borderlands in one hall. The universality of the representatives can be said to be unprecedented. Especially at this critical time of national crisis, gathering borderland representatives to jointly discuss future borderland policy is of particularly profound significance. Although the National Assembly is not a decision-making body, the representatives' suggestive opinions do not necessarily have to be fully implemented by the government, but the gains from this once-in-a-millennium opportunity are truly valuable. The borderland representatives have come from thousands of miles away, bringing infinite hope and harboring infinite suffering in their hearts. Their proposals, their demands, and their voices should be given special attention. The Seventh Review Committee of the National Assembly, is an assembly dedicated to reviewing borderland policies and proposals from borderland representatives. The passage of 34 proposals, regardless of their different content and nature, each with its own rationale, content, profound significance, and great importance, the new government should attach importance to these proposals, extract the essence, and learn from each other's strengths to serve as a reference for deciding future borderland policies.</p>
<p>The so-called borderland policy, specifically speaking, refers to the ethnic, political, economic, and cultural issues of the remote provinces. China's borderland ethnic groups are distributed in the Northeast, Southeast, and Northwest. Geographically, some are separated by great rivers, mountains, and oceans, while others are vast and boundless deserts. Their languages, beliefs, customs, and habits are mostly different from those of the inland people. The development of their society and economy often stagnates in the early stages of agricultural economy. Their lives are special, and their culture is very backward. Under these circumstances, coupled with the improper borderland administration measures of past generations, they feel increasingly isolated, resulting in many barriers. Adding in the external factors in international relations, all issues have become increasingly complex and serious. Therefore, the future borderland policy must first prevent external factors in order to protect itself. Secondly, it must seek internal reform to promote the progress of borderland politics and economy, guide social customs, culture, and education to exchange with the inland as much as possible, and gradually move towards the grand goal of the Chinese nation as one family.</p>
<p>External factors reflected in borderland issues include the Outer Mongolia issue after the founding of the Republic of China, the Northeast issue before the Anti-Japanese War, and the current Xinjiang issue. Their border disputes and ethnic conflicts are all reflections of external factors. From a geopolitical perspective, the growing tip of the ethnic forces of neighboring countries is advancing towards our border. Whether by relying on military force, exerting political pressure, mixing in immigration means, or even using the mutual attraction of people of the same ethnicity, the goal is nothing more than to make the tip of its ethnic forces grow and extend directly into China's territory, while China's peaceful and buffer zone is shrinking inward. Any independent country has its border issues. If the growing tip of the ethnic forces of neighboring countries develops directly towards the country, the country must establish an independent and autonomous borderland policy in national defense and politics to prevent the deepening of external forces, in order to protect itself and for a sense of security. China's border connects with the territory of neighboring countries for thousands of miles. In order to live in peace, in order to protect ourselves, or in order to prevent our ethnic groups from being attracted by foreign races, we should establish proactive ethnic policies and national defense security policies. Article 13 of the basic national policy in the new Constitution stipulates that "The national defense of the Republic of China shall be aimed at safeguarding national security and maintaining world peace." The so-called national security is borderland security; to strengthen national defense, we must first strengthen border defense. Without borderland security, the peace of a country loses its guarantee. In order to maintain world peace, we must first protect borderland security. We hope that future borderland policy should take protecting borderland security as its first goal.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the reform of the borderland political and economic system, the improvement of social customs, and the communication of culture and education, it is necessary to entrust them to wise politicians to implement with progressive and enlightened policies in the future. The Soviet Union's administration of ethnic minorities is managed by first-class politicians; Japan's former colonial administration was managed by outstanding figures in the country. In the future, China's borderland administration should be based on the principle of selecting excellent talents from the borderlands at the local level, and the principle of having first-class politicians in charge of borderland affairs at the central level. As for policy programs, Article 168 of the new Constitution stipulates: "The State shall accord legal protection to the status of the various ethnic groups in the border regions and shall give special assistance to their local self-government undertakings." This is to implement equal policies in politics and ethnicity in the borderlands. Article 169 stipulates: "The State shall actively undertake and assist in the development of education, culture, communications, irrigation, sanitation, and other economic and social enterprises for the various ethnic groups in the border regions. The use of land shall be protected and developed according to the climate, soil properties, and living habits of the people." This is a progressive policy specially formulated for the border provinces, using the power of the state to help the borderlands progress and develop, which is very different from the past policies of appeasement and leniency. We hope that future borderland policies should be thoroughly implemented in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, not only guaranteeing the close unity and unification of domestic ethnic groups, but also guaranteeing the completion of the Three Principles of the People and the national revolution.</p>
<p>Today's Chinese era is an era of the Chinese nation as one family, and it is the beginning of a new era for the borderlands. The new Constitution has established the principles of borderland policy, and the borderland representatives of the National Assembly have contributed concrete opinions. The question now is how to implement and carry out this policy. Finally, we want to awaken the nation's attention to the borderlands and assist the government and borderland compatriots in implementing the new borderland policy.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Sends Letter to Ili Side Urging Clear Stance; Liu Mengchun Discusses Current Situation in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 21st] Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Northwest Headquarters, recently met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and commented on the current situation in Xinjiang: "We can only examine our own shortcomings and work practically. It is difficult to predict the results we will achieve. However, the stability and various practical progress in the seven districts today can be considered a testament to the success of our policies over the past two years." Regarding the Ili issue, he said: "General Zhang Zhizhong has sent a letter to the Ili side, urging them to clearly state their stance on three issues: (1) changing the special status of the three districts, (2) reorganizing the Ili army, and (3) deploying the National Army to the border areas. This letter has been delivered to the Ili side, but there has been no response." However, Liu emphasized the key to this issue, saying: "We are seeking a path to peace and stability based on our established policies and correct principles. If the Ili side repeatedly falls into errors and fails to extricate itself, then we cannot be held responsible for their errors." He believes that the Xinjiang issue today is whether the Ili side is willing to fulfill the peace terms, not who is in charge. Therefore, it is difficult to make other considerations before the basic policies are sincerely implemented by the Ili side. Liu also informed those concerned about the situation in Xinjiang: "Overemphasizing the other side is a sign of weakness. Today, we should strive to make progress on our own. There is no other way to follow, and there is nothing to worry about."</p>

The replies from the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan and the Central Propaganda Department were satisfactory.

The circulation of each newspaper cannot be further reduced. (2) Hengyang is an important town on the Yuehan Railway, the end point of the Xiangguiqian Railway.

<h3>National Assembly Chronicle: A Trickle in a Torrent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Feature] Being in the conference hall on the 21st made one feel insignificant. The 8560 proposals came like a vast flood, overwhelming and leaving people unable to read them all, unable to focus on them all, and unable to hear them all. The conference hall was noisy all morning, like the scene before a movie screening. Secretary-General Hong: "Proposal No. ×× submitted by Representative ×× and ×× others: Subject... Examination opinion..." Chairman Xue: "Do the representatives have any objections to the examination opinion on this proposal?..." This kind of report continued until 12 o'clock, when the examination reports of the first batch of 52 national defense and foreign affairs proposals handled by the second and third examination committees were all passed; however, by the time the meeting adjourned, a quarter of the representatives had already left the conference hall.</p>
<p>The afternoon was even worse: Didn't people like the Xuanwu Lake, Linggu Temple, and the Mausoleum in spring...? Therefore, the huge conference hall seemed deserted. The general assembly was originally scheduled to continue at 3 PM, but at 3:53 PM there were still only 1187 people present. Since the number of attending representatives did not meet the quorum, the first female chairman, Shen Huilian, announced that a discussion meeting would be held instead, conducting an informal discussion on the examination report of the fourth examination committee regarding economic proposals. Unexpectedly, the discussion immediately bogged down on the proposal to "Implement land to the tiller within a limited time and immediately levy progressive property tax..." He Guangju from Shaanxi and Li Hongru from the labor union both opposed doing such important things within six months, believing that the time limit would probably become a mere formality due to reality; therefore, the conveners Zhu Ping and Gao Xin provided explanations and amended opinions. Chairman Shen said, "Let's vote." Someone shouted, "There is no quorum." Chairman Shen came up with a solution despite the lack of a quorum: "How about we conduct a hypothetical vote?" Coincidentally, the number of attending representatives suddenly increased to 1558, which was enough for a quorum; Secretary-General Hong and Chairman Shen quickly changed the announcement to change back to a general assembly, and the hypothetical vote became a formal vote, and the amended opinions were all rejected. The only difference from the morning was that there were two representatives below the stage who were familiar with the process and chanted "No objection" in a loud voice, but by the time the first batch of 57 economic proposals were all passed, Chairman Shen was already panting.</p>
<p>The reporter read through the 73 social security proposals from the fifth examination committee in one breath. Only Chairman Shen, Deputy Secretary-General Que, and Deputy Director Yang of the Secretariat were left on the stage, and there were still more than 600 people below the stage supporting the event. The tired Chairman Shen said, "In order to save time, how about we ask everyone for their consent on the report just read as a whole? Are there any objections?" Unexpectedly, a female representative, Hu Kuisheng, came out and said that the wording of the examination opinion on a certain proposal was inappropriate. Chairman Shen quickly said, "I'm sorry, please don't speak anymore. How about supplementing a written amendment? Thank you, thank you!" The plea was finally effective. The 116 education and culture proposals from the sixth examination committee were read through quickly and passed as a whole, but someone who requested to speak raised an accusation from the balcony: "Why doesn't the chairman allow people to speak?" Chairman Shen repeatedly said "I wouldn't dare." Hong Lanyou and Cui Xinyi hurriedly invited Wang Yizhou from Hubei and Lin Zigui from Fujian to express their opinions on education and culture cases, and made several wording modifications to the examination report. As 6 o'clock approached, there were less than 200 people in the audience. Most people had already read all the advertisements in the evening newspaper and stood up ready to run. Chairman Shen anxiously waved her hands repeatedly, saying "Thank you," "I'm sorry, please wait a moment!" She hurried to end the meeting in two steps, declaring the meeting adjourned. At this time, the representatives claiming their paychecks in the lounge and the representatives hosting the event in the cafe also hurriedly picked up their bags and walked out of the hall, got on the transportation vehicle to go to the banquet. Each vice-presidential candidate and cadres were also about to leave their lively campaign headquarters, once again smiling and bowing: "Please give me a vote!"</p>
<p>It would take at least three or four days to read through all 800 proposals. The representatives all have their own interests. What should be argued and what should be debated has already been argued and debated in the examination committee. The general assembly is just going through the procedures according to the agenda. In addition to thinking about how to establish a permanent institution after the meeting and whether the committee members will be paid, there is only the matter of voting for the vice president. Moreover, this is just spring, so how can one blame the few representatives? (April 21st, Nanjing)</p>

<h3>The Italian People's Front Falters; The Left-Wing Socialist Party Will Inevitably Split Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 21st] The People's Front, composed of the Communist Party, the Left-Wing Socialist Party, and the Labor Democratic Party, has begun to collapse due to its disastrous defeat in the election. Six leaders of the Left-Wing Socialist Party, led by former Interior Minister Romita, have demanded that the leader of the Socialist Party, Nenni, withdraw the party from the Left-Wing Alliance. They have threatened to split the party for the third time. Nenni joined the pro-communist alliance in January 1947 and has split twice since then. Saragat, the current leader of the Independent Socialist Party, was the first to withdraw from the party, and two months later, Lombardo, the most admired leader of the Socialist Party at home and abroad, also announced his withdrawal.</p>
<p>Romita and the other six claimed that they had informed Nenni that they would hold a meeting next Sunday to decide on the policy of "restoring the party's independence." Political observers believe that the six will not withdraw from the party immediately, but if Nenni firmly refuses to break away from the alliance with the Communist Party, the Socialist Party will inevitably split. This move will obviously weaken the strength of the Communist group in parliament, as a number of newly elected members of the Left-Wing Socialist Party will inevitably withdraw.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 21st] Togliatti, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Party, known as the "military leader" of the Italian Communist Party, told reporters in Milan today that he feared that the relationship between the government and the people would soon enter a dangerous state of tension. The election results do not indicate the end of the Communist Party, but only a slight setback in the Communist Party's plans. Communist Party members in Rome are showing embarrassment over the election results. Judging from the reactions of the Communist Party and left-wing elements, the European Communist Parties participating in the Communist Information Bureau do not seem to have agreed on a way to take joint action. The Communist Party newspaper stated that the number of votes won by the Italian Communist Party this time has increased by 18.5% compared to 1946.</p>
<h3>The Italian Communist Party Suffers a Major Blow; Washington Expresses Satisfaction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] US officials believe that the great victory won by the anti-communist faction in Italy in this election is the most severe blow to the Soviet Union and international communism in the "Cold War." Some people believe that the blow to the Communist Party from the results of this Italian election is greater than the Marshall Plan for European aid. This choice by the Italian people will strengthen the strength of anti-communists around the world. Amidst the increasing power of the Communist Party, South Korea, Austria, Greece, Germany, Turkey, Iran, the Middle East, Scandinavia, and Latin American countries will be affected by this election.</p>

<h3>Good Reactions in London and Paris</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] London political figures, except for the Communist Party, unanimously felt satisfied with the results of the Italian election. Sir Anthony Eden, a member of Churchill's "shadow cabinet", stated that this phenomenon is extremely beneficial to the Western European Union and represents the common faith in Christianity, spiritual freedom, and justice of Western European countries. Crossman, a leader of the left-wing of the Labor Party, said that although the defeat of the Communist Party is necessary for the reconstruction of Western Europe, we cannot regard Gasperi's victory as a victory for Britain. The task ahead is to truly help the Italian people establish a social environment in which a truly democratic social movement can grow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The French Popular Republican Party today sent a telegram to the Italian Christian Democratic Party congratulating it on its successful election campaign. Prime Minister Schuman told Reuters reporters that "France and Italy have a common culture and common aspirations. The victory of the Italian Christian Democratic Party symbolizes peace between the two countries and pleasant cooperation between the two countries." The conservative "Le Monde" believes that Togliatti's most serious mistake was attacking the Vatican and irreparably offending the religious feelings of the Italian people.</p>
<h3>Six-Nation Conference Discusses Forming a West German Government; The United States Prepares to Draft a Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] As the six nations of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg resumed discussions on the German question in London on the 20th, the United States' decision to draft a plan for the establishment of a West German government within the next twelve months was the key factor in the meeting. Well-informed political figures believe that after the end of this London conference, the division of Germany will be temporarily completed. The main issue facing this conference is when the occupying powers of West Germany, after consulting with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, will take the next step in organizing West Germany.</p>
<h3>International Monetary Fund Suspends Payment of Foreign Exchange to Recipient Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The International Monetary Fund resolved today to suspend the advance payment of foreign exchange to beneficiaries under the Marshall Plan.

<h3>Churchill Calls on Europe to Unite to Defend Freedom</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] Former wartime Prime Minister Churchill declared today that Europe will not be able to have lasting peace as long as Asians, imperialism, and communists rule Central and Eastern Europe. Unless the people of Europe unite to preserve their freedom, culture, and civilization based on Christian ethics, there will be no hope for the world.</p>
<h3>The United States Promotes Anti-Communist Strategies; Paying Emergency Funds to Achieve Political Goals</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The United States' secret anti-communist plan, "Project X", is now underway. Congressional sources recently revealed that the United States spent approximately $4 million in Italy for "political purposes". It was also stated that funds to support anti-communist groups behind the Iron Curtain will be allocated continuously. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has consistently supported "Project X" in Congress. It is understood that each department in the United States has an "emergency fund". The funds for this anti-communist strategy are paid under the emergency fund after being approved by Congress and government officials.</p>
<h3>British Navy and Air Force Conduct Naval Exercises in the North Sea; To Be Held in Mid-May</h3>

<h3>US Predicts Results of Pyongyang Conference; Will Establish a Unified Korean Government; Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik to Serve as President and Speaker Respectively</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Pyongyang Radio broadcast today that Kim Koo, the leader of the Freedom Party in South Korea, has arrived in Pyongyang to participate in the national unity conference initiated by the North. Another anti-communist leader from South Korea, Kim Kyu-sik, led his entourage of twenty people and departed despite his illness and will arrive soon. At the same time, it was reported here that Kim Koo stated before his departure that if the Pyongyang conference failed, he would commit suicide by disembowelment at the 38th parallel border between the US and Soviet occupied zones. US military authorities predict two possible outcomes of the Pyongyang conference: (1) Pass a constitution, announce the establishment of a unified Korean government, with Kim Koo as President and Kim Kyu-sik as Speaker, and request that the United States and the Soviet Union withdraw their troops simultaneously; (2) Send Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik back to the South to request that the general election scheduled for May 10th be postponed indefinitely. The South Korean leaders may therefore appeal to politicians from the North and South to continue holding meetings.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Five Japanese War Criminals, Half to be Hanged</h3>
<p>Tokyo Tribunal Holds Deliberation Conference</p>
<p>[New Asia Agency Tokyo, 21st] The Tokyo Military Tribunal has begun its final stage of proceedings since the morning of the 19th, holding deliberation conferences to determine the guilt or innocence of each war criminal.

<h3>Former Japanese Prime Minister, Mitsumasa Yonai Passes Away</h3>
<p>[All-People's News Agency Tokyo, 21st] Former Japanese Prime Minister Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai passed away on the 21st at his residence in Tokyo from pneumonia that developed into a brain ulcer. He was 67 years old. Yonai served as Naval Minister in the Suzuki Cabinet, the same cabinet that surrendered to the Allied forces in August 1945. Yonai assumed the position of Naval Minister in January 1940 and resigned in July of the same year due to his opposition to the Army's demand to conclude the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy.</p>

<p>[United Press Chicago, 21st] Dr. Hagvar, of the Chicago Argonne National Laboratory, announced to the American Chemical Society today that a rare, radioactive element called actinium, number 89 on the periodic table, is now being produced from radium tablets. It has been fifty years since the world learned of the existence of elements in nature when French scientist Debierne discovered it from pitchblende and iron metals in 1898. However, its quantity was too small to concentrate. This time, it has been extracted separately, made into a free state, and shaped like table salt.</p>

<h3>Opposition to the U.S. Trusteeship Plan for the Holy Land at the United Nations General Assembly - British Forces Order Evacuation of Haifa Port</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 21st] Large and small countries within the United Nations unanimously opposed the United States' trusteeship plan for Palestine on the 21st, threatening the plan with premature demise. In addition to the Soviet Union and countries within the Soviet bloc, the opposition also includes countries that have traditionally been friendly to the United States. The UN Political and Security Committee is scheduled to meet again at 10:45 a.m. on the 21st to address the Palestinian issue. It is expected that several Latin American countries will also rise in opposition to the U.S. plan.</p>
<p>Delegates to the General Assembly are increasingly feeling that the United States will be unable to garner enough votes to pass the trusteeship plan and abandon the partition plan. U.S. officials acknowledge that the future is bleak.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Lake Success, 20th] As the United Nations General Assembly began its main debate today, the United States and the Soviet Union clashed again over the future of Palestine. Shortly after U.S. representative Austin proposed his trusteeship plan for the Holy Land, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko immediately rose to speak, stating that the Soviet Union "cannot accept" the U.S. proposal. Gromyko continued to declare his support for the General Assembly's original plan to divide the Holy Land into a Jewish state and an Arab state, and strongly attacked the United States' proposal to abandon the partition plan. Gromyko accused the United States of advocating changes to the original plan because it coveted the region's oil and military interests, and that powerful elements in the United States intended to transform Palestine into a U.S. military base and economic "semi-colony." On the day the United Nations Special Assembly began debating the fundamental nature of Palestine, the United States was also condemned by representatives from countries other than the Soviet Union. New Zealand representative Berendsen made a poignant plea to the General Assembly, calling for the need to return to the Holy Land's partition plan and formulate methods for implementing it. Berendsen warned against allowing the United Nations to suffer an irreparable and tragic blow by succumbing to the world's intimidation and violence. Representatives from Australia and Sweden also unanimously expressed agreement with the New Zealand representative.</p>
<p>[United Press Haifa, 21st] British authorities effectively abandoned the key port of Haifa entirely on the afternoon of the 21st.

<h3>Chairman Inquires About Situation in Shanghai, Summons Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi, Encourages Them to Lead All Sectors in Cooperating with Government Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang summoned Shanghai representatives Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi at his official residence at 4:30 PM on the 21st to inquire about the security and economic situation in Shanghai. In addition to reporting in detail, Du and Qian made the following requests: (1) The conscription of 6,000 young men in Shanghai this time. Request approval to train them into a guard brigade to protect local security instead of transferring them elsewhere. (2) Hope that the central government will pay attention to the refugee problem, make overall arrangements for resettlement, and ensure social order. Du and Qian then expressed their opinions on economic policies, hoping that the competent authorities would act cautiously, not change orders from morning to evening, and avoid lighthearted experimentation, such as the past announcement of cotton cloth control without prior notice of preparation, which not only lost the government's credibility but also missed the opportunity to snap up raw cotton. Recently, the sudden prohibition of securities delivery has caused some hot money to lose control, increasing the threat of price increases. It seems that the authorities have not given careful consideration in advance. The Chairman nodded frequently and said: He is confident in suppressing the military chaos, but he hopes that Du and Qian will offer their opinions at any time on economic measures and lead the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors to cooperate closely with the government. After talking for about an hour, Du and Qian then excused themselves.</p>
<h3>Will Public Utility Prices Rise Again? Broadly Involved Issues May Become Clear by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the issue of stabilizing public utility prices, the Municipal Council telegraphed the central government to restore the subsidy policy, but no reply has been received to date. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has been in frequent contact with the Central Bank and the Fuel Management Committee in recent days to reduce the price of oil and coal raw materials. According to Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau: The municipal government has made its best efforts, and the Public Utilities Bureau has done its best to reduce prices and maintain continuous operations. Regarding the issue of early settlement of foreign exchange for oil use, the municipal government has submitted a detailed report to the Central Bank, and President Zhang has agreed to this principle, but technical aspects remain to be discussed. The amount involved requires a decision from the Central Bank because it involves foreign exchange. The issue of loans and advances depends on the economic situation of each utility company and requires the Central Bank to decide based on the actual situation. Whether public utility prices will rise again in May cannot be determined at this time. If the central government provides subsidies and assistance, the problem can be solved; otherwise, instructions will be requested from the central government, and there will definitely be a solution. Furthermore, the prices for May need to be reasonably determined after considering the cost of living index and general price levels to be released at the end of this month. Regarding the handling of this issue, I am in close contact with the Mayor at all times and hope that the Central Bank will provide assistance within its capabilities to help resolve it. The final handling plan may become clear by the end of the month.</p>

The reasons for the retrial are approximately four points: (1) The original verdict lacked procedural integrity because the defendant was not given an opportunity to defend himself. (2) According to the appellant's defense, he was only initially assigned to investigate whether Izumitsu had any stored oil. The removal of the oil after it was concentrated was the responsibility of other employees. (3) A shortage of oil amounting to a huge 72,458 gallons was investigated. With such a huge amount, how could it be carried out and sold without anyone knowing? (4) Director of the General Affairs Department Sun Qinchi has a supervisory responsibility. The original verdict did not mention whether he had protected it or failed to report it, but only said that there was no evidence, and hastily acquitted him. This was not a thorough investigation."</p>

<h3>Manager of Yutai Shanghai Branch - Fraudulently Obtained Goods with Bad Checks - Fled to Xuzhou, Apprehended with Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] No. 12 Xingye Lane, Sichuan South Road, is the Shanghai branch of Shanxi Yutai Cotton Cloth Store.

<h3>Acquittal Followed by Detention: Wen Guangting Finally Released; Xinshi Street Police Station Issues a Statement Regarding the Handling of the Case</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wen Guangting, a technician at the Hu Xinghua Foundry, was accused of robbery and theft. After being acquitted by the District Court, he remained in custody due to bail issues. Yesterday, the District Court issued a release order, placing him in the custody of the Hu Xinghua Foundry. He was released from the Sinan Road Detention Center at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>[Further Report] Regarding Wen Guangting's accusation while detained at the Sinan Road Detention Center to the Human Rights Protection Committee of the Municipal Council that Zhao Baosheng, a volunteer policeman at the Xinshi Street Police Precinct, had subjected him to torture during interrogation, including punching and kicking, and allegations involving collusion and bribery between the local court's bailiff and judge, reporters visited Wang Zhaoxin, the chief of the Xinshi Street Police Precinct, and Liu Lianfang, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Division, yesterday to understand the truth of the case and inquire about the details. According to their account: "At 10:00 PM on January 13th, Du Shu'en, an officer of the Criminal Investigation Division, supervised officers Qu Yuxuan, Zhu Chanzhang, and Du Shufan, along with volunteer policemen Zhao Baosheng and Tang Taosheng, on patrol on Huangxing Road within their jurisdiction. Late at night, they discovered a dark figure. Volunteer policeman Zhao Baosheng quickly apprehended the person, who identified himself as Wen Guangting. A triangular, sharp knife, about five inches long, was found on his person. When asked where he was going, he only said he was visiting a friend in Jiangwan and lived in the Hu Xinghua Foundry at 314 Qipu Road, and gave evasive answers to further questioning, so he was taken to the station for further interrogation. He then confessed to having conspired with the fugitive Jin Xinsheng in three robberies and one burglary, specifically: (1) Around midnight on December 15, 1936, they attempted to rob a young woman near the small vegetable market at the intersection of Wusong Road, but fled when a street policeman approached. (2) At about 10:00 PM on the 27th of the same month, they robbed a woman at the barbed wire fence at Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road, stealing two gold rings. (3) At 8:00 PM on January 12th of this year, they robbed a female passenger on Huangxing Road, obtaining a gold ring and 100,000 yuan in cash. (4) They broke into the back door of Zhu Qiaobao's house at 604 Kunming Road and stole a Western-style stove, a foot basin, and a pair of overshoes. Subsequently, the victims were summoned to the station, where they identified and claimed their stolen goods. Inquiries were also made at the Hu Xinghua Factory on Qipu Road regarding whether a worker named Wen Guangting was employed there. It was reported that while such a person existed, he had been dismissed a week before his arrest due to his unsatisfactory conduct. Later, his accomplice, Jin Xinsheng, was apprehended at the back building of 1110 Changshou Road and interrogated jointly. He also confessed to the robberies and burglary along with Wen. Officer Du also escorted Wen to the aforementioned locations to demonstrate the robbery of the young woman and the snatching of the gold rings. Now, this criminal is exceptionally cunning, stating in his letter to the Municipal Council that the item found in the paper package was a kitchen knife, while the weapon the precinct presented to the court was in fact a triangular, sharp knife. This is indeed verifiable. The precinct believes the crime is factual and charged him with aggravated robbery, submitting the case to the court for trial, and there is nothing inappropriate about it. As for allegations that he was placed on the tiger bench during interrogation and had cold water poured into his nostrils, there are no such facilities here, and a thorough investigation can be conducted."</p>

<h3>Surveyors Head to Build the Shengshan Fishing Port</h3>
<p>The Sisle Islands are the center of the fishing industry in southeastern China. Every year during the yellow croaker and ribbonfish season, over 10,000 fishing boats from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian gather there. During normal times, fishing boats seek shelter from the wind at Xiangzi’ao in Shengshan or Sizhoutang. Neither of these ports has any protection. In the event of strong northwest winds, ships in Xiangzi’ao must flee to Sizhoutang, and vice versa. In the event of strong southeast winds, ships in Sizhoutang must flee to Xiangzi’ao. The ships must pass through Sanjiao Port, where hidden reefs are spread across the port, and fishing boats often collide or sink due to running aground. Based on the Fishing Industry Supervision Office's port construction plan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to use relief funds to build the Shengshan Fishing Port in a work-for-relief manner to ensure safety. The Ministry is asking the Ministry of Social Affairs to allocate relief funds and directing the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Fishing Industry Supervision Office to quickly coordinate with relevant parties to design the port construction project and formulate a plan. It is reported that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Fishing Industry Supervision Office has agreed with the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to send personnel to survey the site.

<h3>Cotton Yarn That Does Not Meet Export Standards: Decision to Exchange with Factories for Cloth for Export</h3>
<p>According to a recent message from the Textile Export Committee, to promote the export of yarn and cloth and support small and medium-sized textile factories in the Su, Xi, Cheng, and Chang areas, the committee has decided to exchange yarn that does not meet export standards with cloth from various factories that meets certain standards. The cloth will then be stamped with a unified trademark before being exported. The detailed measures are currently being drafted by the committee's secretary. Once approved, they will be formally implemented.</p>
<p>It is expected that once these measures are officially implemented, not only will various factories be able to obtain a supply of raw cotton, but the export of cloth will also be greatly increased, which will be beneficial for earning foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In addition, to strengthen ties with various parts of Southeast Asia and to obtain information and expand exports, the committee has decided to establish an office in Hong Kong to report news at any time and facilitate business contacts.</p>
<p>Since the Textile Export Committee decided to adopt a dynamic review method for the cotton yarn-to-imported cotton exchange ratio, a total of 21,345 bales of imported cotton have been exchanged, with 5,281 pieces of cotton yarn and 73,129 bolts of cloth to be exported.</p>
<h3>Weak Sentiment in Domestic Stocks; Still Soft at Closing</h3>
<p>Domestic stocks were still impacted by the persistent stability of the foreign exchange rate yesterday. They were prone to fatigue after a strong start. However, external materials and foreign stocks rebounded slightly, providing a temporary improvement. The results were still soft overall, especially for small stocks.</p>
<p>The market opened weak, and credit was tight. Yong Yarn opened low at 1,920 yuan and then declined to 1,915 yuan. Due to a false rumor of a higher foreign exchange rate, it advanced to 1,955 yuan, but it was soon confirmed that there was no change and dropped to 1,865 yuan. Brokerage fees were reported as flat. Materials and foreign stocks rebounded, and the price rose back to 1,940 yuan. Near noon, there was more profit-taking, and the price retreated to 1,880 yuan. The noon closing was 1,885 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, Huaxin fell to its limit but recovered slightly, down by 10%. Zhongfa Jinglun, China Silk, Commercial Press, and Xinhua fell by half a percent, Xinyi rose slightly, Tongyi remained flat, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yong Yarn opened slightly higher at 1,905 yuan and advanced to 1,940 yuan. Due to heavy selling, the price immediately declined. Although the National Bank intervened, the price still fell to 1,895 yuan. The closing price was 1,915 yuan. Compared to the morning closing, Tongyi and Commercial Press remained flat, while the rise and fall of the other stocks was slight. Unlisted stocks in the over-the-counter market were also flat and weak.</p>
<p>Government bonds stabilized yesterday due to easing credit. United Bond C opened at 105,000, rose to 111,300, and ended at 108,000. Approximately 4 million was traded. Compared to the previous closing, A and B rose by 2,000 yuan, C rose by 3,000 yuan, D rose by 1,000 yuan, and E rose by 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially rallied yesterday but later weakened. Yi Yarn opened at 2.73 million and rose to the 2.8 million mark. For most of the day, it struggled to maintain stability. Near the closing, foreign investors sold off, and securities firms also exited, retreating to 2.77 million at the close. Compared to the previous closing, shipping stocks fell by less than half a percent, while the rest of the stocks declined slightly across the board.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Specifies Scope for Transporting Cash Between Shanghai and Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the previous "Implementation Measures for Managing Remittances and Cash Transportation Between Shanghai and Guangzhou in Various Regions" issued by the Ministry of Finance, the provision limiting the transportation of cash to Guangzhou to 200 million yuan has been revised to 50 million yuan and applies to the entire Guangdong Province.

Furthermore, the Central Bank and the Financial Administration Bureau are instructed to notify the remitter or payee, when reviewing remittance reports, if they find that a remitter's remittance amount is particularly large or the number of remittances is excessive, suggesting the possibility of transferring funds to Shanghai and Guangzhou to participate in speculation, and require them to provide proof of legitimate use; otherwise, they will be stopped from accepting or disbursing remittances.</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Initially Weak, Later Firm; Cotton Cloth Sales Not Robust</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was initially weak but later firmed up, resulting in mixed fortunes. At the opening, it continued the previous day's sluggish trend, hovering at lower levels. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 232 million, and 21-count Double Horse opened from the 150 million mark. Subsequently, rumors of the opening of yarn and cloth transportation to the south boosted market sentiment for a time. However, as actual sales in the local market remained stagnant and out-of-town sales remained slow, prices lacked the strength to rise. By closing time, prices had fallen back down. The former closed at 234 million, down another 1 million. Except for Blue Phoenix, which rose slightly by 1 million, other 40-count yarns continued to fall by 1 million. The latter, due to slight absorption by out-of-town merchants, rebounded to close at 155 million, up 4 million. Except for Golden Rooster and Red Kui Xing, which saw slight price drops, all grades of 20-count yarn rebounded by varying amounts, from 1 million to 5 million. Supply and demand for all grades of 16-count yarn were balanced, with a stable trend and few changes.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market entered a consolidation phase yesterday. Hankou merchants only purchased small quantities of bleached cloth and Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji. Supply of Shilin cloth and dyed cloth from dyeing factories remained scarce, showing a slight briskness. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.98 million, once reaching 5.02 million, and closed at 4.92 million.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current cotton market trend turned weak. The Flower Management Committee showed signs of loosening up, offering low prices, and many were eager to sell, leading to a weak market. Furthermore, due to sluggish actual sales of yarn and cloth and a slight price decline, sentiment became increasingly unsustainable. Therefore, cargo owners no longer raised prices, with each grade falling by about 100,000 compared to the previous day. 550 bales were traded.

<h3>Commercial News from Various Locations</h3>

Furthermore, Mr. Sen Sheng, director of the Guangzhou office of the China-America Relief Mission, recently stated that the rice distribution situation in Guangzhou is progressing well. The distribution work will be expanded to the surrounding suburban areas, and it is planned to increase food distribution in Shantou. A proposal has been submitted to the group.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 21st] The silk market in Hangzhou was weak today, with Hangzhou silk falling sharply by 30 million. Silk fabrics also declined across the board, but the decline was not significant. Rice prices saw mixed gains and losses, with gains exceeding losses.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch on the 21st] The grain market has seen a rebound due to a shift in market sentiment. White Japonica rice is at 3.894 million, White Yuan at 4.044 million, Yang Xian at 3.774 million, Bu Xian at 3.849 million, Wheat at 3.5 million, White Wheat at 3.6 million, Flour at 1.384 million, and Cotton Yarn at 132.5 million.</p>
<h3>Trade with Japan in Arrears; China Trust Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Juesheng, representative of the Trade Group of our delegation to Japan, stated in Japan that the main reason for the near-stalemate in Sino-Japanese trade is that the Central Trust Bureau's arrears in barter accounts with Japan have not been cleared, and there is a suggestion to allocate part of the debt to Japan's war reparations to China. Yesterday, the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau issued a special statement to defend the bureau. It is claimed that: (1) The Bureau's handling of barter trade with Japan and private trade with Japan are independent of each other and have been conducted separately from the beginning. When the government opened private trade with Japan, the Bureau suggested that the government separate private trade accounts. Therefore, the Bureau's barter accounts will definitely not hinder private trade. (2) The Bureau owes the Japanese side a total of 10 million US dollars in barter trade. The Bureau is actively transporting domestic goods to Japan for repayment. At present, the goods waiting to be transported are worth at least 1 million US dollars and are being shipped one after another. The person in charge solemnly stated that owing the Japanese side money is not a disgraceful matter, because when barter trade began, the Japanese side owed the Bureau a considerable amount. Moreover, the victorious countries in the war against Japan could first take loans and then use the loans to offset the debt. This has long been stipulated. Therefore, the debt is purely a matter between the two parties in barter trade and has nothing to do with ordinary trade. (3) The Bureau has no intention of allocating the debt to Japan's war reparations to China. So far, it has not made any recommendations to the government, nor has it made any requests to the Allied Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Weak Sales, Oversupply; Rice Market Slightly Declines; Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes All Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was generally weak. The South Market was stable, while the North Market fell by 50,000 yuan. In the South Market, prices initially rose by 100,000 yuan due to the rise in Wuxi prices the previous day. However, the market then turned from strong to weak due to a lack of demand. Cargo owners wanted to sell but lacked buyers, and prices retreated midway, eventually closing at roughly the same price as the previous day, or even slightly weaker. Only White Yuan goods were in short supply and rose by 100,000 yuan. In the North Market, Japonica rice, thin rice, and Indica rice all fell by 50,000 yuan due to weak sales. White Yuan and special high-grade Japonica rice remained firm. A total of 5,593 shi of goods arrived. The People's Adjustment Committee continued to sell white rice in the North Market, but there was little demand.</p>
<p>Flour re-entered a weak state, due to the fact that merchants had ceased buying again and prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were weak. Sellers felt very uncertain, and successively sold off. As there were neither wholesale purchases nor many retail purchases, supply exceeded demand, and prices gradually fell. Military ship flour fell from 1.42 million to 1.4 million at closing. Old Cart retreated into the 1.4 million range, falling by 30,000 and 45,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng both fell by 30,000. Bran retreated by 30,000 yuan, and wheat mill prices increased by 20,000, to 2.07 million yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains mostly declined. Merchants did not buy yellow soybeans, and prices fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Sales of picked green beans in the local market became sluggish, falling by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Qingdao reported a rise in corn, and Qing merchants bought more high-priced goods, raising prices by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Low-priced goods remained stable, and red sorghum was firm, rising by 30,000. Merchants stopped buying mung beans, and prices fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were potentially very firm, rising by 100,000 to 200,000. Peanut sellers saw a surge in supply, and prices fell by another 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil fell sharply, because raw material prices were low, and all grains showed weakness. Sellers felt uncertain and sold off a lot. Oil factories opened at high prices, with abundant supply. Da You and Da Chang Xin Soybean Oil Factory opened at 8.6 million, but later repurchased transactions were shorter. The lowest Tong Sheng Tai Soybean Oil was 8.45 million, a drop of about 300,000. Actual sales of raw oil were not high, and prices fell sharply by 30,000 to 40,000. Clear oil and vegetable oil also fell. Merchants did not buy soybean cakes, and prices followed the oil market, falling sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Fluctuates Narrowly</h3>
<p>The foreign-operated tea market, which mainly exports Ping Shui Pearl Tea, has seen no clear transactions since the stalemate in the purchase negotiations, and the market sentiment has repeatedly changed. Transactions in other varieties are also very narrow, and the market lacks change. As for domestic tea, all kinds of aged tea remain firm amidst empty inventories. As for this year's new Longjing tea, it is still arriving in batches from the source, and the quality is deteriorating day by day, making it increasingly difficult to maintain prices. At closing, prices were lowered again compared to before. According to industry insiders, Biluochun, produced in Dongting Mountain, is also a famous and expensive domestic tea. The new goods for this year are gradually approaching the picking season and are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Consolidates and Weakens</h3>

<p>Warehouse receipt trading: the initial price of the 16th period was 70,000, at 1.05 million, then back to 1.09 million, then down to 1.06 million.

<h3>Spare His Life!</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>In the early days of victory, the Central Bank opened foreign exchange and stipulated that there was an unlimited supply. The currency value relied on stability, price fluctuations were reduced, and there was a sign of decline. At that time, many celebrities and giants, seeing that the goods in their hands were intangibly depreciating and the people were finally able to breathe, advocated a "high price policy" under the pretext of "protecting national industry and commerce." This was echoed by others, and the hype was extremely noisy. In the past two years, prices have risen steadily, step by step. Although this was prompted by the general trend, it may not be entirely due to the promotion of these people, but the fact is that the lives of ordinary people have become more and more difficult, while the wealth of these people has accumulated more and more. Today, the "high price policy" can be said to have been completed. However, in recent months, prices, although still inevitably experiencing twists and turns, seem to be slightly more stable than before. I am sincerely afraid that the public opinion against the rising winds, after being provoked and incited by those with ulterior motives, will once again change and advocate the "high price policy." This is not the author's oversensitivity, in fact, some people are already uneasy and are issuing the high-sounding argument that "rising prices are really not good, and falling prices are not good either." Once the US loan is effectively utilized and prices show a slight downward trend, it is expected that the "high price" theorists will launch an offensive. At that time, in order to avoid the decline in commodity prices, these people will at least spread such grand theories as "the economy should seek stability."</p>
<p>According to reason, if rising prices are not good, then falling prices should be called good. Falling prices mean that the legal currency appreciates and purchasing power increases. The proponents of stability are simply trying to prolong their lives, so that the goods they have hoarded remain at their original value, and they are trying to rise again. A general decline in prices has no initial impact on manufacturers, because the cost of raw materials and wages is also reduced at the same time; those who are hit are only the hoarding class who sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor, and those who benefit are ordinary people who trust the legal currency. Therefore, there is no one among the common people who does not hope for prices to fall, while the proponents of high prices would prefer to freeze the index and have prices adjust dynamically at any time.</p>
<p>Today, the whole country is vigorously advocating democratic politics. I think that if we want to achieve political democracy, we must first seek economic democracy. Fortunately, the decision-making authorities should give priority to the interests of the majority of the people, and do not rush to purchase in the market when rice prices or other commodity prices show a slight downward trend, just when they are about to return to the prices of more than ten days before the rising winds, and act as a pillar in the middle stream, as if turning the tide when it is about to collapse. Please do not do this, please.</p>
<h3>A Brief Talk on Ink</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren</p>
<p>I bought a piece of purple ink from Ling Xiaohan Pavilion with the words "Man grinds ink, ink grinds man" on it, and I sighed at the pedantry. In fact, the ink that is used for grinding is definitely not good ink, and ink does not grind people either. People get old because they get old, what does it have to do with ink!</p>
<p>According to ancient times, lacquer was used for writing, and in ancient times, graphite was used for writing, and in later generations, smoke ink was used for writing. Since the invention of smoke ink, there have been various schools of ink making, such as Wei Zhongjiang, Ji Gong, the Zu family, Li Chao, Li Tinggui, and the Pan Gu family, who have continued to make progress. During the Six Dynasties, there was no one better than Zhang Yong, and during the Five Dynasties, there was no one better than Huan Chao. Xi Chao's son, Li Tinggui (who was given the surname Li during the Southern Tang Dynasty), made smoke ink that would not spoil even after being placed in water for three years, and was known as a divine product among inks. Later, Su Haoran made ink, all with pine patterns and wrinkled skin, as firm as jade. During the reign of Emperor Zhangzong of the Jin Dynasty, Suhe oil was used to collect smoke to make ink, and the price of ink was the same as that of gold.</p>
<p>After the Six Dynasties, there were Li Chengan, Li Wenyong, Chen Yun, Sheng Hao and others, who made ink that was similar to Tinggui and was also a divine product among inks. The ink used by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty was called Longxiangji. One day, he saw a small Taoist priest walking on the ink like a fly. Emperor Xuanzong scolded him, and he shouted "Long live!" and said, "I am the essence of ink, the Black Pine Messenger." This is inevitably close to mythology. However, the books of the Jin and Tang dynasties and the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties have been passed down for hundreds of years, and the ink color is like lacquer, and the spirit is pure and complete, which cannot be compared with later works. The ancients said that the beauty of ink lies in its light quality, the smoke is taken for its clarity, it has no fragrance when smelled, and it is silent when ground, which is the best quality. During the Xuanhe period of the Song Dynasty, Li Tinggui's ink was more expensive than gold. Gold could be obtained, but Li's ink could not be obtained.</p>
<p>During the Wanli and Tianqi periods of the Ming Dynasty, the most famous ink makers were Cheng Junfang, Fang Yulu, and Wu Quchen, who were the best. They shone one after another with Fang Zheng, Shao Gezhi, Luo Xiaohua and others, until Cheng Yongxiu. However, the ancients used pine coal, and later used tung oil smoke. Deer glue was also rarely used, and beef glue was used instead. The quality has declined and is far inferior to that of the ancients.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the best ink must be light in quality and heavy in glue, and the color must be as black as lacquer and emit light. Painting and writing can be of spiritual assistance. In the past, Dong Qichang of Huating paid the most attention to the use of ink. He specially hired famous ink craftsmen to make it at home. The selected smoke was particularly fine, and the infiltrated glue was particularly shiny, so his paintings and calligraphy have been passed down for thousands of years, and the color is still undiminished. When Qing Wang Lutai painted, he would not write lightly without top smoke. The ancients paid attention to the use of ink.</p>
<p>When I was in Beiping, Yuan Juesheng of Changzhou had the most ink collections and wrote the "Zhongzhou Ink Collection Record". At that time, he was regarded as a giant among ink collectors. However, Yuan's calligraphy was very good, and his ink usage was also ordinary. His daughters were all able to paint landscapes, but were not famous. It can be seen that Yuan's main purpose was to collect ancient ink, and he did not study whether the ink was good or bad. Now that Yuan has passed away, I don't know where his ink collection has gone, and no one can understand it. Collectors enjoy themselves for a while, while calligraphers and painters are passed down for thousands of years. Both are precious and good ink, but they cannot be compared.</p>
<p>History records that "During the Tang Dynasty, Feng Sheng and Lu Qi met on the road, each carrying a bag. Qi opened Sheng's bag and found an ink stick, and laughed loudly. Sheng said sternly: 'This is coal from Tiandu Peak, mixed with the brain of the needlefish, and made in the hands of Jin Huozi. It can be used to record ancient copies of "Lisao". Comparing it to your daily extraction of 300 pieces of silk, being a slave to fame and profit, which is more important!' Then he searched Qi's bag, and it was indeed three hundred thorns." From this, it can be seen that collecting ink is better than running around in the field of fame and profit.</p>

<h3>Wait a Minute [Don't Give]</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>When people are so poor that they become beggars, although they are social parasites and are most contemptible, we humans are ultimately compassionate and cannot watch them starve to death. Therefore, when we encounter beggars, especially the disabled, old, young, and children, we have to do good deeds and spend a few banknotes.</p>
<p>The causes of beggary are not entirely due to laziness. In times of peace and prosperity, it is mostly due to low intelligence. In times of frequent wars, I don't know how many beggars are created by artillery fire. We, who are fortunate enough not to become beggars, if we don't give them a little food to eat, wouldn't they have no other choice but to die? Hard-hearted people don't care, the death of a beggar is equal to the death of a dog, but soft-hearted people are sad even when a dog dies, let alone a person?</p>
<p>If everyone does not give beggars money, there may be two consequences: one is to return to nature - starvation; the other is to take risks - be forced to become pickpockets, thieves, and even bandits. I believe that an ideal society should first seek to have no thieves, and then seek to have no beggars. Allowing beggars to eke out a living may prevent them from becoming thieves. If we don't leave beggars a way out, we will be forcing them to Liangshan.</p>
<p>The newspaper on the 18th reported that in order to prevent Shanghai from becoming a "city of beggars," some people have planned to unite celebrities from all walks of life to initiate and promote the "Don't Give Movement." And it is rumored that: "These beggars can earn two to three hundred thousand yuan a day by begging, and their income is so good that it is astonishing." It sounds really astonishing, but I doubt it. It is unlikely that beggars have such good income. Although this suspicion has no scientific basis, where is the definitive proof of that rumor?</p>
<p>If such a luxurious, wealthy, beautiful, and happy Shanghai becomes a "city of beggars," it would indeed "hinder the city's appearance and also affect public health and social order." The question is how to turn beggars into non-beggars, and prevent non-beggars from becoming beggars. Before the problem is solved, it would be best to delay the launch of the "Don't Give Movement."</p>
<h3>On the Virtue of Wine</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Liu Ling's "Ode to the Virtue of Wine" certainly praises wine to the extreme. Meng Dongye's "Poem on the Virtue of Wine" says: "Wine is an ancient mirror, revealing the hearts of villains. When drunk, you see strange actions, when drunk, you hear strange sounds; the merits of wine are so many, and the shortcomings of wine are also deep. Wine can exempt criminals from punishment, and this can be used as a warning." This is indeed very true. Drinking and playing cards with people often reveals a person's true temper and nature from a small action. Especially after getting drunk, people who are usually silent will talk more; people who appear gentle and refined will also be rude and reckless. The ancients said: "Wine can confuse nature." In fact, wine is the most capable of revealing people's true nature, and it is indeed a mirror of the human heart. There are many people who intentionally do not drink alcohol, even though they also love alcohol very much. Yan Baiyun said it well: "Traitors often don't drink, their hearts are like mountains and valleys. They hook out drunken words and pretend to be friendly. How poisonous is this heart! Don't talk to them when drinking."</p>
<p>I am a drunkard, happy to have a cup in my hand. After getting drunk, I sing and laugh wildly, and open my heart to people. Once, as a result of laughing wildly, my jaw dislocated. Now it has become a problem, and I often have to dislocate it if I'm not careful. However, I have met several close friends in wine who can share weal and woe. However, in order to drink more, my body is getting weaker day by day; after getting drunk, I have offended many people with my wild words. Several times I have been "hooked" and fallen into a "horse trap," to the point of "being abandoned by everyone," and unable to recover. However, I am still fascinated by the "thing in the cup." The wine itself is good, and it is wonderful, I only blame myself for not being able to control it well. But it's terrible if it is used by "traitors." It is still an obvious evil to use sleeping pills, and experienced people can identify it at a glance: "Pretending to be friendly" is really terrible, not only will it take your life and property, but it will also ruin your reputation. It is lovely to scold people while drunk, and it is mostly a person of temperament. So I say: "Wine is a thing of emotion, and tobacco is a thing of reason." You see, people who are used to scheming are often inseparable from tobacco; the pillow skills of opium smokers are even more terrible. So I always praise wine, even though I am now too sick to drink it.</p>
<p>"The merits of wine are so many, and the shortcomings of wine are also deep." I praise wine, and I complain for wine.</p>
<h3>Yu Temple</h3>
<p>— Sanmu</p>
<p>Clamping the river, the Yue King's capital stands tall, the red walls and Chongtang have been around for half a kalpa, the grass on the jade steps grows long with the remnants of armor (temporary station of demobilized youth army), the inscriptions on the stone tablet are plowed by wild men; the mountains and rivers contribute to the world, and the patrols are often hoped for at the beginning, looking as far as the floating clouds laboriously north, the Yellow River has become a canal today!</p>
<p>From Yu riding a boat to visit Xiaoyunxi, climbing Nen Yunlou, the day is already late</p>
<p>Outside of the tender cloud den, the evening clouds cover, a desolate cold presses the edge of the water, the kalpa has not yet ended, the monks have failed, the tower is idle, and ten thousand plum blossoms are killed.</p>
<h3>Children's Village</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In the foothills near Qu Loujing in Switzerland, there is a small village of 50,000 square yards, scattered with twenty-four red pine thatched huts. Each house is inhabited by a group of orphans of different nationalities. This is Bertarosi's Children's Village. The greatest purpose of the Children's Village is not only to provide physical nutrition to orphans who have suffered the ravages of war, but also to nourish their souls and enable them to understand peace and love between people.</p>
<p>The birth of the Children's Village is the realization of a dream. In the summer of 1944, Walter Robert Cauty, the editor of a Swiss monthly magazine, wrote an editorial calling for the establishment of a refuge for the world's war orphans.</p>
<p>The response surprised Cauty. Thousands of letters filled with money and suggestions came in. He organized a "Children's Village Association" and consulted several architects, educators, and psychologists before the plan was realized.</p>
<p>After the address was selected, Swiss children raised donations in the streets and alleys to build the Children's Village. Two young brothers donated their shoe-shining income. Students sacrificed their holidays to saw wood. Seven hundred workers did 80,000 hours of work voluntarily.</p>
<p>Twenty-four houses were built. The height of the furniture, stairs, windows and door handles are all designed to be suitable for children to use. Each house can accommodate sixteen children, and is cared for by one "father" and one "mother."</p>
<p>French children who used to work underground learned that they could live without riots. A little girl from Germany no longer wakes up in the middle of the night calling for her parents who have already died. Polish children who once vowed not to live under the same sky as the Hungarians are now making friends with their "enemies."</p>
<p>The greatest achievement of the Children's Village is to calm down the war orphans who are still traumatized and sow the seeds of "world unity" in their hearts.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Few people are normal, most people are a mixture of genius, mentally retarded, and mentally ill patients.</p>
<p>Some people are dead, but their names are still alive; some people are not dead, but their names have already died.</p>
<p>It's really miserable when people can't laugh and cry as they please - but, in fact, people are really that miserable.</p>
<p>There are thorns everywhere without the rose, and there are roses without thorns, but you can't find them anywhere</p>
<p>Nervousness and dullness are all the same, all the same neurasthenia.</p>
<p>People say that plants and trees are emotionless, but they forget the tear marks on the spotted bamboo, the red beans planted with Acacia, and the bitterness of the lotus seeds, and the connection of the lotus roots...</p>
<p>Many people treat endurance as enjoyment; there are also more people who treat enjoyment as endurance.</p>
<h3>Su Dongpo's Jade Belt</h3>
<p>— Xiao Peng</p>
<p>This newspaper reported that in this fire at Jinshan Temple, the ancient sites of the temple, such as the Zhou Ding, Zhuge bronze drums, and Su Dongpo's jade belt, were spared, which is also fortunate. There is an interesting story about the Wang belt left by Dongpo in the past, which is described as follows:</p>
<p>Originally, the abbot of Jinshan Temple in the Song Dynasty was Zen Master Foyin, who was Dongpo's friend in the Buddhist community. When Dongpo went to Hangzhou, he passed by Runzhou (Zhenjiang) and stayed at Jinshan Temple for a few months. One day, Foyin hung a sign and led his disciples into the room. Dongpo entered the abbot's room to see him in plain clothes. Foyin said, "Where did the Minister come from? There is no place to sit here." Dongpo joked, "I will borrow the four elements of the monk to use as a meditation bed." Foyin said, "This monk has a turning phrase. If the Minister answers immediately, I will grant your request. If you hesitate even a little, I would like to leave the jade belt you are wearing to suppress the mountain gate." Dongpo agreed, and took off his jade belt and stepped on the chair. Foyin said, "This monk's four elements are originally empty, and the five aggregates are non-existent. Where does the Minister want to sit?" Dongpo hesitated and did not answer immediately. Foyin hurriedly called to the attendant, "Take this jade belt and suppress the mountain gate forever." Dongpo laughed and gave it to him. Foyin took a cassock skirt to repay him, and there were two quatrains. Dongpo answered in the same rhyme, with the lines: "Sick bones can't bear the jade belt around them, and dull roots still fall into the machine of arrow tips. Wanting to teach the begging prostitutes to the singing courtyard, I deliberately gave the old cassock of Yunshan." Reading this, one can imagine the humor of old man Po in those years. Now that this jade belt has not been affected by the disaster, it can indeed suppress the mountain gate forever.</p>
<h3>Ling</h3>
<p>Reading the newspaper, besides the "Miss China" beauty pageant, there is also a "Miss China Queen" Ms. Wu Yungele. This kind of lively event also belongs to the European style. In the past, there were many reports of "Philippine Queen Elected," "Paris Queen Crowned," and so on. As for the selection of queens in various cities and schools, it is the same meaning but different name as selecting city flowers and school flowers. However, the Chinese "后" (hòu, queen) and the Western "Queen" have similarities and differences, which can easily cause doubts. In the past, after the selection of the "school queen" at a university in the western suburbs of Peiping (Beijing), many male students joked and called themselves "emperors." Although it was a game, the meaning of the word became clearer, so it cannot be left unsaid.</p>
<p>The ancient meaning of the word "后" (hòu) is the monarch, the ruler of the body, what is called "后者後也" (hòu zhě hòu yě, the ruler is the successor), which originally did not belong to women. It is repeatedly seen in the "Book of Documents" and the "Book of Changes," as well as various classics, and this was the case before the Xia and Shang dynasties. It was only during the Zhou dynasty that "后" (hòu) began to refer to the spouse of the emperor. (Before this, the emperor's wife was only called 妃 (fēi, concubine), meaning "mate.") Then there was the empress (皇后, huánghòu) as a match for the emperor, and the empress dowager (皇太后, huángtàihòu) on par with the retired emperor (太上皇, tàishànghuáng).</p>
<p>As the master of the palace, below her were concubines (妃, fēi), consorts (嬪, pín), noble ladies (貴人, guìrén), etc., who faced north to serve her, just as princes and dukes were subjects to the emperor. Even the emperor's close uncles and brothers, although honored as princes, were still subordinates to the empress. Therefore, the empress was still one with the emperor. However, no matter what, she was always a married woman, never deviating from the idea of "a wife is honored by her husband" and "the husband is the foundation of the wife," without the qualification to be independently respected.</p>
<p>The Western "Queen" is different. Although she is a woman and paired with a "King," although the King's wife is called Queen, the Queen's husband does not necessarily have to be a King. Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth of England were both rulers of their country, not Queens because of a King. In addition, the husbands of the female rulers of countries such as the Netherlands cannot consider themselves Kings simply because their wives are Queens. Also, during World War I, Wilhelm of Germany ravaged Northern Europe. The Netherlands was spared, and the cable translation said that it was because the Dutch Queen's consort was German and was able to use his connections to mediate. The term "駙馬" (fùmǎ, imperial consort) used here is also borrowed from Chinese and is very forced. The Queen's husband is certainly not an emperor or an "imperial consort"; he can only be given the title he deserves based on his own position.</p>
<p>In Chinese history, the so-called "female rulers," even if they held great power and ruled the country for many years, such as Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty and Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty, were all elevated because their husbands were emperors. Although Wu Zetian established the "Zhou Dynasty" and changed the title of "hòu" (后, queen) to "dì" (帝, emperor), it was fundamentally different from the Western Queen. The Japanese imperial family's titles largely follow the Chinese system, but women are also given the title of "Prince" (王, wáng) (with the ranks of 内親王 (naishinnō, imperial princess) and 女王 (joō, princess)). Their imperial house rules stipulate that when the emperor is vacant, the regent should first be the crown prince and princes of various ranks. If there are no male candidates who have reached the age and qualifications, it is the turn of the imperial princess, then the princess, then the empress, and finally the empress dowager. Although there is this written rule, there is definitely no such fact. In Chinese history, when the emperor was absent, there would be an "old Buddha empress dowager" who would either listen to politics behind a curtain or command everything without doubt. The daughters of the emperor could only be called princesses and had no qualifications to ask about national affairs. Japanese imperial princesses and princesses, although they cannot formally inherit the throne, have a "regency" clause (with the order being above the empress, valuing bloodline over marital status), and their nature is between the Western Queen and the Chinese princess.</p>
<p>Whether it is a city queen, a school queen, or an association queen, to avoid misunderstandings, it is better to translate it as "Queen."</p>
<p>The two most famous "Queens" of England are both related to the era-defining prosperity of the world's strongest country. Elizabeth, with her unparalleled beauty, reigned supreme, and the country was prosperous, with all industries flourishing. Great writers such as Shakespeare, Bacon, and Spenser all made their names in this era, and poetry, drama, and science all flourished. During Victoria's reign, the country's power was particularly strong, from the King of England to the Emperor of India (Empress), creating a new era for Great Britain's founding and expansion of national power. Therefore, the Western custom of selecting flowers and queens in general also has the symbol of prosperity and strength, and is not just for a temporary excitement and liveliness. This meaning should also be understood.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Translation Doubts</p>
<p>Old Affair from Thirty Years Ago: Question about Housing Redemption</p>
<p>Sun Xianjun asks: I have several legal questions. Please answer them, I would be grateful. (1) I received a mortgage on a house from a certain family in the second year of the Republic of China (1913). The mortgage contract did not specify a time limit. If, according to the Civil Code, the mortgagor's right to redeem expires after 30 years from the expiration of the mortgage, I wonder if the eight years during the War of Resistance should be deducted? (2) The lower half of the rent receipt book obtained with the contract was damaged during the war. Fortunately, the upper half of the rent receipt book, which contains notes, is still intact. Under such circumstances, I wonder if it will be deemed that the document has defects and is invalid?</p>
<p>[Answer from Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi]</p>
<p>(1) The outbreak of the War of Resistance caused different times of fall of different places, and the obstruction of the exercise of legal rights also varied, so it cannot be generally calculated as eight years. If judicial power cannot be exercised, it is indeed a reason. However, the circumstances must be proven, such as whether both parties were in the same location and whether there was a clear expression of redemption? Did the mortgagee refuse? Etc., cannot be generalized. (2) To examine evidence, you must look at the original object, which cannot be measured. If it is incomplete, it is a defect. However, evidence with defects does not mean that it has no evidentiary power at all.</p>

<h3>Husband Died in a Foreign Land: Drifting in a Different Place</h3>
<p>A Reader Submits a Letter Seeking Mother and Younger Brother</p>
<p>Editor: Xiuyun is originally from Yuliang, She County, Anhui. During the War of Resistance, she followed her husband and moved to the interior. News of her family has been cut off for five years. Unfortunately, her husband died in a foreign land, leading to her drifting in a different place. Recently, she received a letter from her hometown, learning that her loving mother and younger brother left with her brother-in-law Tang Jizhong, who held a military position, during the war. However, after many inquiries, there is still no trace of them. I have long admired your newspaper's circulation throughout the country.
