<h3>九龍城事件突惡化　港警竟鎗擊我居民　王外長向英方嚴重交涉</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十二日急電〕九龍舊城內今晨發生不學事件，港警又對我九能舊城內臨時陋屋之住戶，採取武力行動。此不幸事件遂使九龍問題益趨惡化。我國居民五人爲步槍彈所傷，港警並投催淚彈，致另有其他居民幾人負傷。緣十二日晨有全副武裝港警擬進九龍城繼讀拆屋，居民惶恐，出而抗拒，詎即遭該港警以手槍，催淚彈之射擊。</p>
<p>九龍居民協會代表張忠武，竟於抗拒中首先被槍彈繫中頭部，負傷之居民五人中有二人爲婦女，現均已送入九龍醫院急洽。據我外交部駐兩廣特派員辦事處稱，香港當局對於其擬拆卸我居民重建之臨時陋屋事先並未提出通知。此等臨時陋屋係暫時聊供遮蓋之用者。至發電時，仍有大批港警，駐於九龍與城區，從事警戒防止我貧民重建家室，催淚彈所留氣息猶未廓淸。據官方調査，香港警察隊除採取强迫行動後，我九龍城居民受傷六人，其姓名如下：受重傷者梁創，王賴鳳英，受輕傷者張忠武，張炳林，劉三妹，孫日等。今晨九龍城警察利用催淚彈與步槍對付城中臨時草屋中之我國同胞，强其遷移，死傷之確實數月雖經仔細查核，仍未能確定。港政府聲稱五人刻正在治療中，而可靠方面消息，則謂重傷二人輕傷四人，根據一目擊者之鄉民稱，傷者至少六人，並謂小孩一人，其姓名未列入死傷名單中，亦受輕傷。療治傷者之醫院亦未能供給必要之消息。該院醫生護士長護士以及詢問處之職員，對於記者始終不透露傷者之數目問題。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十二電〕港悉：港警槍擊我九龍城同胞事件發生後，居民哭聲震天，事態嚴車，港方因此已禁止記者使用港穗長途電話。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港十二日電〕九龍舊城區之木屋經港當局於一月五日强制拆除後，該處居民又在原處車搭茅屋二十座，港當局十二日晨乃派出警士一百五十名前往拆除，與佔住該處之居民約一百名發生衝突，佔住者以石塊向警士投擲，警士則以催淚瓦斯，長棍手槍還擊，激戰半小時。最後卒將二十座茅屋拆除，僅留一中國國旗　　於斷頃殘壁之上。現該區仍由警士守衛中</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕頃悉：外部王部長於今下午接獲報吿謂，香港政府有續派武裝警察進入九龍城並傷害中國人民情事，異常憤恨。王部長當即電召英大使施諦文至外部嚴厲要求倫敎政府，立即訓令香港總　，在此交涉期問，對九龍城中止一切强制行動，不再淚還察進入該城。其餘當俟今日事件詳細報吿到後再談。王部長對於我外部本月八日所提各項書面求，已一併嚴促英方接受，英大使允立即電達倫敦政府。又悉：局已電令粵宋主席，對九龍城受難居民作必要之救濟。</p>
<h3>對九龍城拆屋事件　外部八日抗議文　促英注意兩國間之睦誼</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕關於九龍城事件，我外交部於强制拆遷發生之次日，曾向英國大使館抗議，旋於本月八日復以書面向英政府提出抗議及要求，茲探悉原文如下：</p>
<p>外交部茲向英國大使館致意，並　述，査自香港政府于一九四七年十一月二十七日飭令九龍城內中國居民拆遷房屋以來，中國各地興論頗受激動，外交部除飭主管人員及駐廣東，廣西特派員迭向英國大使館及香港政府治商外，並曾於一九四七年十二月十日，由外交部長親向英國駐華大使表示，希望中·英兩國政府　視當地人民與香港政府問友誼之維　與增進，並望香港政府對於此點亦取同樣態度，避免任何具有相反作用或刺激性之行動·本年一月五日，港九大隊警察與伕役，武裝進入九龍城內，强拆九龍城內居民房屋數十間，並逮捕富地居民代表二人，對於該處貧苦無吿之居民，亦無任何妥善安置辦法，任令露宿荒野，無處爲家。外交部劉次長當于一月六日親向英國大使館參事雷博濟提出抗議，並於本“緽向英國大使聲明，吿以此事旣屬條約問題，亦　關涉人道。査九龍租借地設立，係根據一八九八年所訂中英展拓香港界址專條，該專條規定「所有現在九電城內駐紮之中國官兵。仍可在城內各司其事………，又　定在所展界內不可將居民迫今遷移」，依照此項規定，九龍城之管　權，自應屬於中國，英國政府且不得迫令　城內居民遷移居處。香港政府前於（一九四六）年九月十五日發表聲明，認爲自（一八九八）年中英展拓香港界址專條發生效力之日起，該九龍城於租借期間，即爲英國　展領土之一部，屬於英國主槽範圍，外交部　即於同年同月十八日公開聲明中國政府之態度，重申中國政府從未放棄在九龍城之管總權。此次香港政府採取强制行動，迫令九龍城居民遷移，其所持理由爲該等房屋所在地段係屬英國皇家官地，此項理由顯係漠視中國在九龍城所從未放棄之管轄權，中國政府斷難予以承認，中國政府並認爲，香港政府强拆九龍城居民房屋一舉，與中英兩國及其人民間素具之陸誼亦相抵觸，外交部長向英國駐華大使館鄧重聲明，依據一八九八年中英展拓界址專條之規定，中國政府仍享有在該九龍城之管轄　，並絕無放棄該項管轄槿之意。對于英國政府過去及將來　反一八九九年中英展拓香港界址專條所採取之一切措施，中國政府斷難認為合法。英國政府對於該專條如有不同之解釋，應循正常外交途徑謀求公平合理之解決。關於香港政府强迫拆遷九龍城居施，立即飭令香港政府釋放被捕之居民代表，制止繼續逮捕，並妥爲安置此次遭受損害之居民，相應略請査照，迅即轉達英國政府，並予見復爲荷。</p>
<h3>賓安縣已準備　對港經濟封鎖　廣州各界羣情憤激</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十二日電〕九龍城事件日益擴大，此間各社國及學生紛起聲援，除已組織後援會及派出　問團赴九龍城慰問受難同胞外，密邇香港之實安縣　問團代表大會並議決準備封鎖港九外圍，禁止物資輸出。穗市糧商，銀錢業公會及市民紛紛捐款救濟受難同胞，人心憤懣已極。</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港十二日電〕據悉：廣州傳已出現反英標語，但未提及有如南京之示威遊行。實安縣境會開　衆大會，傳已通過決議案，對港停遝食物，否則須港方履行下列條件：</p>
<p>實行賠償被維居民。</p>
<p>釋放被捕之兩人。</p>
<p>保證今後不發生同類事件。</p>
<p>〔又電〕關於十二日晨九龍城衝突事件，香港政府發言人承認警察曾開槍數發。渠强調此係警吿手特中國國旗之　衆走散者。</p>
<h3>工商貸款　可能部份開放</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕開放工商貸款問題，四聯總處已分向國家行局徵詢意見，以便　集討論。若干人士認爲：將來如開放貸款，亦爲部分的，例如對民生日用品原料，將採訂貨制度，至貸款方針，將仍依去年七月四聯總處公有之民生日用品貸款綱要施行。至若干交通器材，其不能採訂貨制度者，則當予以開放。</p>
<h3>參駐委會今開會審議國家總預算</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕參政會　會委會定十三日舉行之審議國家總預算會議，決在國府舉行，聞將連續三日，始克審議完竣。</p>
<h3>文武職指數發薪計算原則已確定　政務會今提出討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電」文武職人員待遇調整辦法，經國務會議通過，按照生活指數計算後，並即交政院擬訂實施辦法。政院經數日之研討，業已確定分區之指數計算原則，十三日政務會議中將予討論。另悉：取締民生日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法實施細則，經經濟部次長童季齡擬訂後，交經濟部長陳啓天，原定提十三日政務會者，現因該原稿在陳氏處，十三日晨始携返京，故恐不及提出討論。</p>

<h3>伊斯蘭世界的動盪</h3>
<p>同教朝聖團一行五十四人，自朝　　　　　以來，既入京覲謁　主席有所報告，日昨即已分乘政府所派專機，飛返蘭州迪化等地。朝聖團諸君遠去麥加，萬里朝聖，不特達成了他們信仰上的某一種願望，從此可以稱爲「哈奇」（Hadi），衆望所歸；抑亦足以增進我國與伊斯蘭世界各民族間的了解，加强中國與伊斯蘭世界各民族間的睦誼。</p>
<p>正當此一朝聖團自麥加回返他們故鄉的時候，我們盱衡世界局勢，對於伊斯蘭世界內的動盪不甯，尤覺關切彌深。首先，我們要聲明的，就是在我們的國境內，雖然有廣大的伊斯蘭教信衆，但我們並不是一個伊斯蘭教的國家；正惟其如此，所以我們對於伊斯蘭世界局勢的關切，並沒有主觀的成分或其它自私的企圖。如今的世界局勢，既愈趨於分裂為二，在這一種情勢下，伊斯蘭世界的動向，實在關係世界的安危。我們前於論到世界分裂為二的時候，曾說，我們是一個東方的國家，但不認爲有世界的東西分裂。如果世界果有分裂，伊斯蘭世界就介於這分裂的中間，　　重輕，伊斯蘭世界在目前世界的局勢中所處地位的重要，自可想見。</p>
<p>目今伊斯蘭的世界裏實在太動盪了！巴勒斯坦的分治決定，不特促起了巴勒斯坦境內的阿剌伯人民與猶太人之爭，抑且激動了泛阿剌伯民族的情緒，所有阿剌伯民族各國家，若埃及·沙地阿剌伯·伊拉克等，無不起而爲巴勒斯坦的阿剌伯人民聲援，且不惜以流血力爭。目前在巴勒斯坦境內，阿刺伯人民與猶太人之間既迭有武装衝突，使全境陷於戰爭刦禍的邊緣，等到英軍撤離，放棄委任統治權的時候。行將更有大规樓的鬥爭，似乎也势所離免。在巴勒斯坦以外，因喀什米爾局勢的發展，致使印度與巴基斯坦兩新近成立的「道米甯」互控於聯合國的安理會，印度聯邦對於伊斯蘭世界內的巴基斯坦多所指摘；而喀什米爾境內的流血事件却依然未嘗有什麼停止。此一鬥爭不僅有傷印度與巴基斯坦兩個兄弟之邦的情感，抑且有關世界大局，是不能聽其自然發展下去的。此外，印度尼西亞的動亂，也不僅是一個僅僅興荷蘭有關的問题，實亦爲伊斯蘭世界内動盪局勢的一環。但最富有戲劇意味的似乎要算從北非方面傅來的消息。報載摩洛哥獨立黨領袖的談話，他說：「如果美國容許法國在北非繼續執行目前這種壓迫的政策，我們要向另一方面請求協助了。是的，我是措蘇聯。」</p>
<p>我們如果一考查第二次世界大戰後伊斯蘭世界之所以如此動盪不甯，不難發見其中的一個主要原因，便是由於這次次世界大職後領導世界的美國對於伊斯蘭世界沒有明確堅定政策。美國在戰後已為一個领導世界的國家，但它所缺乏的似乎是一個如何領導這一個世界的整個世界政策。它也許可以有一個對歐洲的政策，對遠東的政策，但似乎至現在爲止還沒有一個整個對世界的政策。一個對歐洲的政策和對遠東的政策，僅是對整個世界政策中的搆成部份，它們必須在一個對世界的整個政策中纔有它們準確的估計。因爲是這樣，所以直到如今我們没有看見美國有對於伊斯蘭世界的明確堅定的政策。在某一意義下，美國對伊斯蘭世界的政策，可以說是依附在它的對歐政上的。在摩洛哥及北非固然不必說，就是在巴勒斯坦，情形亦復多少相同。這就是說，在它的對巴勒斯坦政策上，美國多少是跟着英國走。分治的計劃，原由英國所提出，而在聯合國大會席上，都是美國在竭力支持。蘇聯對地中海東岸一帶，原有它的計劃，所以最初它以阿剌伯人民同情者的姿態出現，藉以博得阿剌伯人民的好感，但它唯恐巴勒斯坦不亂，一面又支持猶太人回國，最後且以與美國妥協的姿態出而支持分治。此其目的，固甚明顯。乃不意美國竟在英蘇雙方的播弄下而有這樣一種與阿剌伯人民意願不相符合的決策，致不免影響爲了它在伊斯蘭世界中所有的地位。這實在是很可惜的。</p>
<p>我們似乎還不會忘記當年的墨索里尼曾自稱爲伊斯蘭的保護者，如今法西斯政權雖已傾覆，墨索里尼也早已不在人世，但我們却未能絕對地說今天巳沒有再想自稱爲伊斯蘭保護者的人。我們應該說白在另一世界裏還有廣大的「阿拉」的崇拜者，在土谷曼人民共和國裏，在烏孜別克人民共和國裏，以及在另一世界的其它的人民共和國裏。如果世界果有分裂，則伊斯蘭世界的一部原早巳在另一世界裏。摩洛哥獨立黨領袖的談話，雖不免意存威脅，但也值得我們深思。我們願負有領導世界責任的美國，不可輕視了伊斯蘭世界內的問題，進而對於伊斯籣世界能有開明智慧的決策，使目今出現在伊斯蘭世界內的動盪局势，能够復歸於甯靜。</p>

<h3>執行援歐復興機構　應受國務院管制　馬歇爾在衆院堅決表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十二日廣播：華盛頓訊，馬歇爾國務卿今日出席衆院外交委員會作證，捉出與上遇在參院外交委員會作證時相同之意見，此即渠對於執行援歐復興計劃之機　，並無任何成見，惟堅主設立一　獨之機關，直接受國務院管制。馬氏認爲歐洲復興計劃與美國之外交政策「密切相關」，且爲美國對外關係之最重要表現。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿十二日向衆院外委會陳述關於歐洲復興方案之意見時，預料將被詢及援華之問題，馬卿之言，可能較在參院外委會中陳述者更爲有力。據接　國務院之人士透露，國會之審査援歐方案已進入第二週，馬卿之對國會將批准適當數額及條件的方案，已愈爲樂觀。馬卿之當前任務在避免共和黨之牽涉其他問題，以拖延援敵方案之實施。衆院外委會之將詢及援華計劃及拉丁美洲之經濟狀况，均爲共和黨此等計策之一部份，此外若德國工廠折卸以供對軍廠賠償之問題，預料亦將由衆院外委會向馬卿提出。又參院外委會今日將　　聆取美　英大使陶格拉斯就援歐問題之意見。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕美參院外委會昨日結東其三日以來對歐湘復興計劃之討論，衆院外委會則定星期一開始檢對同一問題。鑒於外委會主席及兩黨政治領袖所發表之言論以及各委員對馬歇爾與駐英大使陶格拉斯證言之密切注意，可知歐洲復興案之考　，將極爲澈底而延續數星期之久。</p>
<h3>管理援歐「錢袋」問題　美覓取折衷辦法　國務院管理說已遭强烈反對</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕據十一日　露，美高級行政官員現正「　勉與有希望」地覓取一項方式，使國會及國務院雙方，關於主持馬歇爾歐洲復興計劃事宜，皆感滿意，目前之爭執，係關於是否由國會抑由國務院管理「錢袋」，以及是否設立一受國會節制之公司，抑設立一率國務院命令之主持人，實行此項龐大計劃問題。</p>
<p>國務卿馬歇爾關於力促接受國務院之方案，業已遭遇嚴重之反對，現正覓取一項折衷案，目的在打開該項障礙。迄今爲止，尙未獲得滿意之解決辦法，但某一地位極高行政官員之消息吿合衆社稱。國會議員現正覓取方案，並對覓得滿意答案，亦有希望，但繼稱：「此事將爲長期艱難之奮鬥」。同時，衆院撥款委員會主席泰勃對馬歇爾計劃，業已宣戰，泰勃稱：「費用太大，」渠在一項激起騷動之聲明中，曾稱杜發門之援外費用計劃「打擊」美國及世界，渠力稱國務卿馬歇爾極盼國會對此計劃蓋上橡皮圖章，渠發現馬歇爾犯有提出令人驚奇建議之罪，不配担任國務卿。</p>
<h3>援助中日韓　應先提出國會　美共和黨伏利斯意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕美共和黨議員伏利斯吿記者稱，吾人在討論馬　爾計劃前，援助中國·南美·德·日及朝鮮法案應先提出國會。吾人未便質然表決一種計劃，然後始發覺已無餘力資助他國。同時據國務部消息，馬歇爾計劃中原定第一年援助英·法·西德及希臘之款已减少二十億元，資助義大利，丹麥及瑞典之數亦稍有核减，惟對荷蘭，比利時，　森堡及挪威則稍有增加，如是則馬歇爾計劃最初十五個月所須經費共計六十八億元。</p>
<h3>杜魯門新預算　遭共和黨攻擊　認爲美財力不能勝任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十二日廣播：華盛頓訊，共和黨議員對杜魯門總統所提之預算案提出　難，認爲「過份浪費」，「非本年度內國家之財力所能勝任」。參院撥款委會主席勃里奋領導此種攻擊。渠認爲總統雖於上星期建　减低每一納稅人之負擔四十元，但照預算案觀之，此事實不可能。總統所建議之國防經費與對外援助經費雖不能謂爲完全　切，尙合實際需要，但渠亦將加以嚴密之審査云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕杜魯門總統十二日將向共和黨控制下之國會提出一九四九年之財政預算，此項預算將有很快成爲一九四八年競選運動主要爭執問題之望。此次預算書，係厚達兩英寸之文件，包括五十七頁長之總統咨文及長達一千三百七十五頁之說明及數字在內。</p>
<h3>法派員赴英倫　商十六國會議　擬成立一永久性組織</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敎十二日電〕英法將於十三日起開始磋商再度召集馬歇爾計劃下之歐洲十六國巴黎經濟會議。法外交部經濟顧問阿爾芬特以及法國首席經濟計劃家莫尼特之助理馬麥林，可望於今日自巴黎抵比參加磋商。</p>
<p>磋商之主題爲重開十六國會議及其範圍問題，以及成立經常情報諮詢組織問題。按十六國均要求在馬歇爾計劃開始時即成立是項組織。</p>
<h3>美物價上漲　預料今年更高</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十二日電〕一九四七年美國物價，已被指爲太高，但據許多預測，一九四八年且將更高。銷費者之金元，祗能買到一九三五至三九年期之一半貨物，但其所有金元較多，且在一九四七年底銷費甚達，故能維持現在之物價。一年以來，物價幾不斷上漲，達到一九二〇年第一次大戰後之頂峯。</p>
<h3>英貿易入超　上月輸出量激增</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕商務部長威爾遜昨夜在此間之會議席上稱，十二月份英國出口量之臨時統計，顯示每日輸出價値較戰後任何月份爲高，乃廿五年來最高之記錄。十二月份出口數量，較一九三入年約高百分之二十，而預定一九四八年中期之出口量目標，爲一九三八年之百分之四十，相差僅百分之二十，然十二月份輸入價値亦大增，故入超仍達三千九百萬鎊。</p>
<h3>法通貨膨脹　達慢性階段</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十二日電〕最業部長柏弗里林十二日稱，通貨膨胀已達慢性階段，如不遇正，則將使法國　陳，結果殊難逆料。渠　請農民支持政府新訂之向富有者微稅政策，該法案規定收入若干以上者則微收超　稅。渠　農民保證　將以貸款　眞農業　　。</p>
<h3>義收稅員罷工　支持銀行職工</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十一日電〕共黨　所領導之總工會，頃命令十六萬名收稅員，於十二日起　工，以支持六萬名在罷工中之銀行職工</p>
<h3>參院兩委會考慮止付　美對日佔領基金　認爲政府未充分供給對日情報</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕美參院撥款委員會委員參議員諾　吿合衆社稱：就渠個人之觀點言之，陸軍與國務兩部，非至兩部提供有關日本工業分散政策之充分情報以後，在下一會計年度中，對於日本佔領行政費，將無基金可得。諾　政當局對解散日本經濟集中之政策全部透露，並對於賠償政策，作充分之說明，然後兩委員會，始能審査兩部所要求於七月一日開始支用之日本佔領基金。諾　承認國務部業已供給渠若干情報，但有兩主要事件，兩部並未供給，　為日本議會最近通過四項法案實施經濟分散政策之副本;　爲關於賠償問題，吾國未向其他國負有任何義務之確切證明。</p>
<h3>聯合國朝鮮委員會　昨召開首次會議　烏克蘭等兩國代表缺席</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城十二日電〕聯合國朝鮮委員會今日下午五時在此間召開首次會議，地點在以前美蘇混合委會之德壽宮中。列席會議者有金奎楨及國際來賓多人，是日缺席者有烏克闌等兩國代表。首由臨時主席胡世澤宣佈開會理由，略謂「我等爲朝鮮之獨立而來，今日各國各界代表在此與朝鮮國民進行協議，本人甚感欣喜」。嗣選出印代表梅農爲會議主席，先是菲代表主張在未接獲聯合大會命令准許不願烏克蘭而單獨進行工作之前，暫不推選主席，但遭否決，繼由中法叙菲等國代表演說。</p>
<p>我代表演辭</p>
<p>中國代表演詞之大意謂：「經過八年戰爭二年和平之時間，朝鮮迄未完成獨立，此乃極不幸之事件，中國目前情形頗不安定，尤其是東北，東北不安定使朝鮮亦受其影響。朝鮮以前曾係一獨立國家，於日俄戰爭及中日戰爭之後，始淪爲日本帝國主義之殖民地，而今已是朝鮮獲得獨立與自由之機會，中國恭爲鄰國，自當關心朝鮮之獨立完整，吾人亟望朝鮮能與世界各國謀求合作，共同致力世界和平」</p>
<h3>麥克阿瑟希望　駐韓軍隊早撤</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十二日電〕據悉：麥克阿瑟將軍亟願早日自朝鮮撤退全部駐軍，駐軍撤退後，南北兩區將可和平合作。麥師此意係吿朝鮮委員會菲代表阿蘭茲者</p>
<h3>美商人駕機出發　作環球飛航</h3>
<p>〔路透社麻愛米十二日電〕美商人十名將於今日出發至全球各大城市包括北平，作環球飛行，以屬於阿特拉斯供應公司之空中霸王式機一架，作為飛行樣子間，內置安樂椅十六具，有聲電影　放映機，及收發無綫電設備，預定四月十四日返美。</p>
<h3>美海軍陸戰隊　未奉令調聖地</h3>
<p>〔路透社費城十一日電〕美海軍陸戰隊司令蓋資將軍今日聲明，並未下令派美國陸戰軍隊前往巴勒斯坦。調往地中海區之美陸戰隊千名，乃例有之調遣，不過為補充現駐地中海美艦隊之陸戰隊實力而已。</p>
<h3>約但河上大橋被炸毀　叙巴間通道截斷　阿遊擊部隊加緊訓練中</h3>
<p>〔中央社耶路撒冷十一日合衆電〕此間破壊份子今晚特將續跨約但河上「雅各之女」大橋炸毀，使巴勒斯坦與叙利亞間之軍要通過爲之切斷。爆炸發生時，約但河左右　岸之阿艙兩族亦展開閘河激戰。英方發表關於大橋被炸一事之聲明中，未指明究係艙太人或阿刺伯人之破壊份子所爲，僉信贈太地下軍現正企圖將阿刺伯眾隊自叙利亞黎巴　邊界來　之可能路徑悉予切斷，故可信大橋或係猶太地下軍炸毀者。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴勒斯坦阿遊擊隊山嶺總司令部十一日電〕阿拉伯領袖吿本社記者稱，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯遊擊軍已在　馬利亞及迦烈里附近之山嶺基地，受大規模訓練，在一個月內即可以紀律蔽明之軍事部隊出動。阿拉伯壯丁離家投身遊擊隊者無數，担任訓練者多爲會在英軍服務之委任官佐。同時傳說阿拉伯族心目中之英雄卡華基率領之阿部隊數千名，亦正準備自叙利亞邊界侵入巴勒斯坦，此舉將爲爭奪巴勒斯坦主人地位的大規模戰事之信號。記者在加烈里區山間作四百五十公里之旅行，在那勃魯斯·吐爾卡恩·及珍寗等三城所謂「恐怖三角地」內，見携帶各式長短槍械及刀刃之阿拉伯人往來不絕，彼等皆表示正在等待出戰之命令，並確信必能包圍並殲減猶太軍。耶路撒冷區阿拉伯軍司令阿勃杜爾赫賽尼助將來珍寗，晤遊擊隊領袖，珍寗市中心祇是身上掛滿子彈的阿拉伯人，在公路上並克携槍之阿拉伯人乘吉普車往來馳驟，各要道口均設障碍物，嚴密檢查往來車輛，阿拉伯人之武器彈藥似頗充沛。</p>
<h3>羅前王卡洛爾　關切國內局勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社里斯本十一日電〕羅馬尼亞前王卡洛爾，今日在此談稱，余認最近羅馬尼亞之事件，對於我國及國際局勢均有極嚴重之關係。以所謂民主人民共和國實際上即爲蘇維埃共和國，代替君主政體，乃共產卞義在歐洲更進一步之行動，實為對於文明世界嚴重的威膏。余對余子之宣布遜位，深表痛心，就一切微象觀，相偕遜位之舉及其條件，乃强迫所造成。在最近羅國歷史中最黑暗的時期，余對余子之命運深感憂慮。今知余子至少已獲安全，開後實深欣慰。羅馬尼亞之併入蘇維埃制度，違背羅馬尼亞人民之精神。彼等之未來及自由，今後當有賴於文明世界之獲得勝利。</p>
<p>〔合衆社盧森堡十一日電〕據可靠方面稱，丹麥安妮公主諒將於十二日晚或十二日清晨，乘火車　此前赴瑞士之白賽尼城。</p>
<h3>柏林區美軍官　遭蘇軍槍傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十二日廣播：柏林訊，蘇方軍事機關報星期日載稱，「柏林區內對於主張德國分裂者無立足之地位」。數小時後，蘇方邊境守軍向美陸軍少尉及其　子之　　開搶五發，結果該少尉受傷。</p>
<h3>片山內閣考慮　解散日議會</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十二日電〕共同新聞社今日稱，日本中央整肅　員會將解除對前農相平野之整肅令，「殆已成為定案」，此使片山內閣　於政治局勢之動機不安，而考慮解散議會之可能　益增。據悉：保守派份子將於本週開始成立新黨之具體工作，更多政府黨黨員之脫黨，仍不足使反對黨居於多數黨地位。擬議中之新保守黨將使社會黨在議會中减少川席，其結果將使政府在議會中而臨極端困難，故片山哲主張解散議會，希望能在另一次總選中孤注一擲</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕日前農相平野整肅問題發展之結果，社會黨內部現已對西尾末廣　起而攻之，衆料在此次該黨大會中可能將西尾勢力打倒，而造成片山淺沼路綫。倘片山首相至此仍不知依時勢爲轉移，再不願放棄片山西尾路綫，則恐將造成內閣改組而實現蕭田首相之機會。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕自由當認爲組織保守新黨之時機，業已成熟。爲積極使其具體化，十二日召開幹部會議，曾任命新黨創立準備委員十一名。此等委員即與民主黨脫黨之幣原派同志俱樂部之一部份會員，當時報吿積極使新黨運動具體化之旨，並要求予以援助。</p>
<h3>日地震學家預測　日本將有大地震</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十二日電〕京都大學地震學專家佐佐謙一郞，曾一再發出　告，謂日本將有大地震，致使本　各地居民寢食不安。今日又稱，猛烈之大地震隨時可以發生，其推測根據則爲近來天氣溫暖，或爲大地震之前奏，京都大阪一帶居民應從速凖備。先是另一地震學家山口修一博士曾預測，東京區亦將有大地震，但今日已將此項預測打消。</p>
<h3>菲擬向美國借款　用以建設水力發電廠</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺十二日電〕羅哈斯總統今日決定向美國金融界借款一千八百萬元，建設四大水力發電廠。</p>
<h3>聯合國巴爾幹委員會　調查報告書發表　指責阿國干涉希臘事件</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典十一日電〕關合國巴爾幹委員會十二月份之報吿書，已於今日發表，其中指責阿爾巴尼亞干涉希臘事務，並積極參加希臘之遊學隊活動。並日「本委會對於聯大建議案所涉區城內最近的政治局勢，深感不安。」</p>
<p>關於保加利亞之部份，報吿書有云，「對保和約雖已簽字，然希臘企圖與保恢復外交關係之企　，刦引起保國之要求希召回駐保聯絡官，驅逐大批希人出保，及保阿友好條約簽字日保總理狄密特洛夫之宣言。關於南斯拉夫部份，報吿書牽直指出對南關係在繼續惡化中，已有一九四七年底之官方文吿爲之透露。報吿書最後並述及一九四七年十二月廿四日希遊擊隊司令馬柯斯所領導「臨時民主希臘政府」之宣布成立，稱之爲最近最驚人的政治發展。並日聯合國巴爾幹委會對於南保阿三國與該臨時政府從事合作所引起的後果，正予以密切的注視。此外對於可能引起由聯合國委員會建議召開聯大非常會議的任何事件，亦加以嚴密注意。</p>
<h3>希請美解凍黃金　俾得遏止黑市穩定幣値</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典十二日電〕今日透露：希臘政府已請美援希團轉　請英國解凍希臘前向美國聯邦準備銀行借款一千萬元時作爲抵押之金幣一百三十萬枚（合英金二百五十萬鎊），使希臘銀行得以拋售黃金，過止金幣黑市價之上漲而穩定希幣特拉克馬之幣値。</p>
<h3>美技師冒暑從事　中東油管工程　穿越大沙漠長逾千哩</h3>
<p>〔美國新問處華盛頓十二日電〕美國工程師等一行，現正在溫度高及華氏表一百卅度崎嶇不平之中東荒地，辛苦工作，從事於完成阿拉伯油公司一千零四十哩之油管測量工程。彼等爲開始移動世界煤油經濟之前導人，蓋因世界對於油類之用途與需要，較前更多。例如在美國，一九四七年之生產與消耗率，估計超過二十億補，即較之一九三八年之消耗多八億桶，並超過該年之世界總消耗。至一九五二年美國之悄耗量，預料將達二十二億桶。由沙地阿拉伯之亞勃圭地方堆置在黎巴嫩海岸之油膏，預定每日可運油卅萬桶，以供歐洲之用，此外並已完成協議，將美國至歐洲航綫上之油船，移至歐洲至市東之綫上。加里比安之產油及對美之輸出已告中止，預料自一九五〇年起，阿拉伯之油管將代替西半球對歐洲之供油工作。</p>

<p>〔透社柏林十一日電〕飢寒交迫之德國人民，復因德國已面臨統一或分裂之命運而深感不安。値茲緊要關項，任何足被一方視作挑撥性的行動，均足以造成德國之分裂，而從　撒回駐四強盟啓會之代表。果爾，則西德與東德即將形成。柏林大部份人士均信分裂已屬必不可免，蘇聯已在柏林之蘇聯系報紙中提出警吿　，聲明任何被蘇聯視爲違反四强協議之行動，將引起即時性的後果。此等行動包括洗軍區之參加英美合併區。目前西德經濟機構之進一步成爲政治機構，或英國之附和美國停止撥付西德對蘇賠償物等，西方强國茍就前述諸行動中之任何一項成就決議，則蘇聯必將即時採取反措施，宣布退出盟國管制會。若德國之分裂成爲事　，則首先感覺其後果者將爲柏林。就地理上言，柏林於蘇聯區之心　，蘇聯若切斷道路鐵道及電力自來水之供應，可使不受歡迎的英美法人，不能在柏林居住。</p>

<h3>美救濟米配售計劃每一市斤民月得五升　登記戶籍者即可受配給　市委會決在月內完成準備工作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市配售美國救濟物資委員會第二次會議，於昨午四時，在市府會議室舉行。出席吳國楨，顏惠慶，霍寶樹，沈宗濂，葉實甫，奚玉書，顧敏琼，曾紹樞，陳廣沅，劉宗岳，任顯羣，及美援華會代表安佛來，糧食佔十二萬五千噸，第一艘船已抵滬，第二艘即將抵達。決將其分配於京滬平津穗五市其中京滬平津已具配給規模，惟廣州正在籌備中。中美救濟協定規定，美救濟物資乃配給已受配之分類的市民以外者。所謂分類市民係指公敎人員，產業工人，職業工人等。以本市而言，凡屬有戶籍登記住戶，均應受配。在南京行政院處理美國救濟物資委員會商議結果，定四個月配售計劃，每人每月定爲食米五升，四個月計得二斗。目的在於平均供應，希望對於糧界安定有所作用。配價與市價不擬相差太遠，可能每月調整一次。中美協定之意義，在於協助中國建立全面性之配給制度。若協助成功，則我政府可控制糧食，而解決糧食問題。院委會商定之結果，正與美國代表交換意見中。</p>
<p>吳開先催促籌印購米證</p>
<p>繼由吳開先稱：本市現行受配市民之外，尚有四萬萬人待配。故指定專需之機構先行籌劃，印購米證亦須着手準備。嗣吳市長稱：凡報戶籍者即有權受配，希望配米能平均，且延續長期辦理。後由繆嘉銘，顏惠慶，及美方代表充分交換意見，決定照中美救濟協定辦法辦理之，根據院委會所定辦法，由上海市配售美國救濟物資委員會決定具體實施辦法，決於本月內籌備就緒。開始配售日期，待物資到滬後方能決定云。</p>

<h3>全日供應正常</h3>
<p>米市昨因天氣陰雨，到貨祇三千餘石，但南北市塲管理委员会仍各以一百三十五萬之價配出七千五百石，合共一萬五千石，故全日供應正常，市勢疲軟，白粳盤旋一百四十萬元左右，未越限價。至於本市未辦理糧商登記之米號六百馀家，昨本市府已令社　兩局招待停業。</p>

<h3>平滬空運販毒破案經過曲折　十主犯將依法處極刑</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令部稽查處最近於上海破獲空運販毒钜案，查獲之嗎啡共九十餘斤。逮捕主犯及嫌疑犯男女共廿五名。聞主犯十名均將處以極刑。該案之破獲，情節複雜，據中央社記者自負責方面獲悉詳情如次：去年十一月間，警備宣司令接獲有關販毒之密報，略請有人自北方共匪區域運毒至平津，轉運上海，再運銷各埠，當飭交稽查處偵查破案。稽查處乃每日派員至龍華機塲，對來往旅客特別注意偵查，其次，在檢查乘客名單時，發現一現役軍人上校階級名李劍飛者，乘坐航空公司飛機，每一二週必來往平滬一次，因啓疑實。嗣查知李在滬常住南京飯店，與其往來者多河南籍朋友，而查其朋友之中，有一部份係河南幫毒販。辦案人員乃用「細胞」，設法與李接近，得悉李之右手衣袖中，經常藏有手槍，同時知其確爲平滬販毒機構擔任運輸之責。至十二月九日，因又偵悉其販毒方法係於其身上特製之馬甲運來。即在機塲守候十一日下午五時，李乘機由平至，闢湖北路安東旅社四一九號房間。</p>
<p>旅舍捕獲毒販</p>
<p>稽查第七大隊人員乃馳往旅社，見室內有上海販毒機構負責人海子靈（一名買長德），及買仁法，丹責，賈金寶，孔繁貞等數人，當予逮捕，並在海子雲身上抄獲嗎啡樣品三小包，繼悉李已另闢室揚子飯店三一〇號，遂留數員留守安東旅社，一面趕往揚子。李犯又不在，搜索房間，在衣櫥後面，查到運藏嗎啡之布製馬甲一件，實彈毛瑟手槍二六七〇號一枝，及子彈四十餘顆。嗎啡連皮當塲稱過，計重五市斤八兩，加封帶隊。</p>
<p>假上校入牢籠</p>
<p>當晚十時許，守候安東旅社之稽查員王德昌忽聞電話鈴響，找賈長德接電，王便用河南口音接談。對方深信不疑，道名正是李劍飛，並訴說他現在是別處借打電話。王德昌告訴他：「賈老闆正在吃飯，你要來就來好了」。李劍飛遂入牢籠，於到達安東後，立刻被擒，在身上抄出偽造之國防部第二廳上校參謀證件竟達十張之多。</p>
<p>根據旣得綫索，又分別在吳宮飯店拘警卜隆福（一名卜錫三），在新民旅館三十九號拘獲陳輯熙等兩名毒犯。在滬之主犯八名乃全部就擒，又在其他數處拘獲疑犯十五名。</p>
<p>供出機構內幕</p>
<p>在第七大隊審訊室中，李劍飛無可抵賴，寫下一篇自由書，招供替海子雲去北平收買嗎啡不諱。繼審訊海子雲，供出河南幫在滬販毒機構詳情：該機構設於老西門中華路中華市塲十四號，負責人名單爲：經理海子雲，副經理孔繁貞，賈金寶。經濟後台老闆陳輯熙，毒品改製工程師丹青，卜隆福。滬平間運毒者，李劍飛，賈仁法。</p>
<p>海子雲在滬常闢室於大方飯店，在平寓校塲五條三十三號，並在平觀音寺二十一號間設宏　金店，販毒已有八年之久。其供出與其有連繫之北平三大販毒犯姓名爲：馬學義（即馬二爺），賈立志，李本初。毒品係由馬學義等自其方匪區運出，轉運滬上，再運銷河南等處，前後爲數甚鉅。</p>
<p>南市抄出毒物</p>
<p>運輸方法除空運外，間或由平乘火車運至天津，再自天津搭輪將毒品密裝於顏料桶內運滬。現在南市老西門中華路中華市塲十四號，尚藏有嗎啡兩大箱。</p>
<p>審訊人員據供，派施堅等往南市提取該項嗎啡，一係柳條包，一爲木箱，內蔽已製成嗎啡及未製之原料共八十餘斤，由經辦各員予以加封。</p>
<p>滬案辦理情形呈報宣司令，宣氏極爲震怒，手論繼續追緝北平有關毒犯。徑陶處長與路督察長研究後，派第七大隊附施堅，行動組長閻錦文，於十二月廿一日，乘機飛平，會同平營備部稽查處人員，開始平案之破案工作。</p>
<p>平兩主犯落綱</p>
<p>平販毒巨頭馬學義風聞滬夥黨「失風」，即由原之和平門裏簾子胡同廿五號，遷住前門裏紅井十三號其姘婦劉鳳鳴（一平劇票友）家中。施閻等據密報，於十二日廿二日在彼處將馬捕獲。又在香爐營頭條四十四號捉獲另一毒犯賈立志，至李本初因無固定住處，被其　說。施閻等並於東華門大街廿七號香獲爲李劍此案尚牽涉平市參議員賈某在內，據悉，賈某在平只有大之　勢力，現由平稽查人員繼續偵查之中。</p>
<p>平案辦理完成，施閻等於今年元旦押同所捕兩犯乘機返滬，於日前將全案人贓解送稽查處，將移送軍法處法辦云。</p>

<h3>走馬看柳州</h3>
<p>〔本報衡陽五臼訊〕西南的大動脈—湘桂路，在抗戰期間成長，也在抗戰期間毀滅。勝利兩年後，才在千辛萬苦中復了員。由於路向員工們的艱苦奮鬥，雖在襤褸開疆的初期，却頗有蓬勃進取的氣象。柳州又名馬平，位居</p>
<p>柳江下游</p>
<p>地處要衝。柳江至此，水量漸大，下游小汽船直達桂平，梧州，其上帆船可通長安。陸上交通，有四通八遠的公路網，湘桂黔鐵路以此爲中心點。市　比櫛，商務發達，形成桂省四大城之一。柳州市區，因柳江橫亘其間，分河北河南兩部。河北爲舊市區，淸幽可愛，專署縣府等機關，均設於此。河南爲新市區，馬路較寬，車輛交織如梭，頗有都市風味。兩市區間有浮橋連貫，渡河交通不感困難。大商店尙均在河北區，惟河南區看來似較河北熱鬧，頗有駕河北而上之旣。</p>
<p>柳州尙未設市，但市政較設市的衡陽進步得多。，「法」「制」我們不說牠不重要，但「人」究竟是凡百事業的原動方。此種說法，並不是反對制度的建立，是要請大家在建立制度後切不要忘了「人」的因素。假使有了很好的制度而不得其人，反不如先重視「人」然後注意制度，至少制度與人應該是並重的。廣西省政當局，計劃將柳州</p>
<p>闢工業區</p>
<p>柳州確具備道個條件。因為柳州除鐵路，公路，水道，極爲方便外，還有一個西南最大的機塲，可供百架飛機同時起落。</p>
<p>柳宗元先生會謫官於此，柳州　的文化種子就是那時經他播下的。河北城東的羅池廟，即是柳人紀念他而修建的。該處現在改爲柳俟公國，丙有柳公的衣冠塚。公園面積不十分大但是古木參天，景物頗佳。在煩囂的市區內有此一塊淸靜綠洲，市民遊憇其間對於身心的陶冶和精神的調劑，是一個不可多得的所在。桂林山水甲天下，但</p>
<p>柳州山水</p>
<p>也不下於桂林。環市均是怪石山峯，挺拔雲表，湘桂路局所在地的鵝山，就是此種怪石山學之一，惜以時問忽促，除遊覧柳侯公園外，其他風景區均未能登臨一遊，深以爲憾。</p>
<p>這裏的物價高於桂林而低於衡陽，但外來的百貨則高於衡陽，城市婦女有點港風。本地貧苦婦女多是赤脚短衣。肩挑搬運的笨重工作，都是赤脚短衣婦女担任，男人從事此種苦工者較少，這裏已進入南中國地帶，所以氣候較暖，與衡陽相較，不是隔一兩個月，而是隔了一兩季。（本報特派員黄潮如）</p>

<h3>海南二礦</h3>
<p>〔本報海南島四日航訊〕海南礦務局，於元且成立以來，積極開發田獨，石碌兩大礦區之豐富　藏·査田獨，石碌兩大鐵礦，爲世界第一級良礦，早已蜚聲海外。海南陷敵後，日本人曾以三億日圓，開採石碌礦產，拼命經營。計由民國卅年起至卅四年止，統計石碌礦藏已採掘者達六十二萬噸，已輸出者達四十萬噸，尙存於八所港之礦石，約二十二萬噸。田獨礦藏已採掘者有二百六十七萬噸，輸出二百四十萬噸，尙存於楡林礦石，約二十七萬噸。視此數字，可知日人已吮吸我海南寳藏之豐矣。幸自民卅三年冬後，盟國發動反攻，在中國戰塲方面，不斷派大批盟機轟炸海南島各重要地點，兩鐵礦乃於卅四年一月起，停止開採工作，礦藏幸能稍爲保存·茲據關係方面獲悉該兩礦區之概况，報道如次：</p>
<p>田獨鐵礦</p>
<p>位於海南鳥榆林港東北約十二公里田獨村之紅泥嶺，拔海一百公尺，爲磁鐵礦，埋藏量約一千萬噸，含量最高者爲百分之六十八，平均可得百分之六十二。日人開採時期，各方面均有完善設備，採礦方法，極力實施機械化。由田獨至安田築有長約十八公里之單軌鐵道，由礦山至楡林，亦有汽車可達，並設有三十八公噸之蒸汽機關車十架，二十公噸載貨車一百九十輛，輸送能力，每日可能四千公噸，露大貯碳塲容量五萬公噸。此外，並設置各種民船三十餘艘，建築楡林碼頭，以利搬運出港。此區開採之最盛時期，日人曾自港，穗，滬征募工人連八千名之多。</p>
<p>石碌鐵礦</p>
<p>位於海南鳥西岸昌江縣東北，爲噴出礦藏，質作　狀，爲結晶之赤鐵礦，含鐵成份最低爲百分之六十二，最高爲百分之六十六，平均爲百分之六十四。硫磺，磷，銅等不純物之含量極少，藏　已確定者爲四萬五千萬噸，未探定者約三萬噸以上。日人佔據該礦時，曾大規模開採，計劃產三百萬噸。其開採方法，當時係用露天採掘，可容六千餘人，採掘之主要機械設備，有試維機，鋻岩機，發電機及各種採　機不下十餘種，數達二百三十多輛。輸送設備則有水平運搬，起卸，列車，及裝貨用之設備六種五百六十多架，同時並築有事務所，倉庫，娛樂塲，修理廠，宿舍等房屋九百餘間。礦塲交通，由石碌至八所。築有長約五十一公里之單軌鐵道。此外，並築有八所港，碼頭及防浪堤等，以利出納及礦石落運之用。在日人經營期間，由卅年至卅四年，曾分批由港，滬，穗及各地招募而來之礦工達二萬餘人之多。</p>
<p>現資委會決定大規模。開發此兩鐵礦，自接收以來，長草漫漫之礦山之荒凉景象，將從此消逝矣。（通訊員陳梅靑）</p>

<h3>丈夫在押經年　怎能壽保證金　邱會鶯女士服藥求死</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州七日航訊〕本市源元倉街四號居民邱會鶯女士，年三十崴，江西興吉人，於前夜突服安眠藥片自殺，翌　爲鄰居發覺，送往公敎醫院施救，幸爲時不久，得以復穌。記者於昨夜赴醫院三十六號病房探詢自殺眞象，情節曲折，可悲可潣！</p>
<p>緣邱女士之夫歐陽布侖，卅五年任甘肅渭源縣長時，因秘書葛敏有挪用天蘭路工賑款放貸情事，致爲當地土劣向省府控吿，省府即將歐陽等撤職査辦，羈押於保安司令部看守所，不許與外界接觸，歐陽之妻邱會鶯，以丈夫在押，囚食難咽，遂在外奔走衣食，並每日為歐陽送飯兩次，苒荏經年，家中衣物典賣已盡。</p>
<p>當歐陽初被押訊時，渭源仍有不少着良人民，爲其聲援，遂宣吿無罪。民事部份，送皋芝地方法院審訊，亦以罪數丕足，宣判無罪。檢察官蔡小宣認爲不可，又提起公訴，高等法院班判於本月三日下遵，仍判無罪。詎蔡檢察官仍不許恢復自由，言十日後（本月十三日）方可獲釋，且還看是否再提起公訴，並云：若想獲得自由，須繳納保證金五千萬元，邱以典賣無物，吿貸無門，孑然一身，遂生厭世之念。</p>
<p>邱女士陳述至此，以凄慘悲惻之語調稱：「我丈夫關了一年多監獄，家中只有我一個女流之輩，目前家徒四壁，每日兩餐已感無法張羅，那有幾千萬元可以繳納？我是一個受過敎育的女子，每天到監送飯時，又不政將　苦况向我丈夫傾訴，免得他更難過·我受這一年多的折磨，早已吐過幾次血，前天中午，又把家底僅有的一床棉被面子，也拆下賣去了，一以為我丈夫旣然無罪，出獄後使可重振家事，好好做一個人，現在一切都成了泡影，我活着還有什麽意思？……」言下泣不成詮。</p>
<p>邱女士仰臥於病床上，在慘　之燈光下，益顯面容憔悴，當因一年半為痛苦折磨之結果。據鋻師談，伊雖脫離險境，但尙不時暈迷，伊不時頻頻輕呼「蔡檢察官饒命吧！……」同往之某報女記者，亦為伊一　辛酸陳述引起無限同情，暗同流淚，臨行並以僅有之四十萬元，捐贈予伊，此事已引起社會人士之普遍同情。</p>

<h3>本市專科以上校長會議　决定下期收費標準　暫定食米三石至四石計算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本學期即屆結束，各私立院校下學期學生微費問題，爲各方所矚目。本市私立專科以上學校校長在顧及敎員合理待過及學生家長可能負担之　費原則下，於昨日下午三時假清華同學會集會討論，大夏大學校長歐元懷任大會主席，開會前後半小時，各校代表二十餘人均沉寂無言，顯示此一雙重「極難解決」之矛盾問題，益增加其嚴重性，而各具有沉重之苦悶。歐校長報吿開會意義稱：吾人今日討論各校下學期學費問題，應先顧及敎員之合理待遇，蓋此爲各校最大而主要之開支。國立院校敎員待遇，政府已決定自本月起按照生活指數折扣計薪，且定每三月調整一次，私校學費不能微收兩次，而敎員學生兩方面之困難，均須兼籌並顧，希望詳加討聯，俾得合理解決。歐氏詞畢，各校長相顧無言，半小時後，始申中華工商專校沈嗣莊發言，說明當前物價如狂馬奔騰，敎員待遇過低，實無法安心敎學，並稱該校下學期將有五分之二學生，勢將被迫停學。嗣各校長及代表相繼發言，展開熱烈對論，最後決定以目前物價高漲情形，爲顧及學生家長困難，各校下學期學雜兩費，按熊當時實物市價米計算，暫定爲三石至四石，屆時如有特殊情形，另行開會議決。又爲討論私立院校共同問題，各私校除依舊參加上海市專科以上學校聯合會外，並決定今後經常召開私立專科以上學校聯合會，由各私校輸流負責召集。昨日出席該會之各私校校長及代表爲光華朱經農，聖約輸涂羽鄉，滬江凌憲塲，牙醫專科司徒博，上法褚鳳儀，法政學院郭孝先，立信錢素君，光夏商專組石，中華工商沈嗣莊，大同胡敦復，震旦胡文耀，東南醫學院呂運明，誠明文學院蔣維喬，南通學院王夢鳳，新中國法商學院盧錫榮，無錫國專王振常，新專陳高　，蘇州美專顏久樑，上海美專劉海粟，東吳周承恩，東亞體專陳夢漁等二十餘人。</p>

<h3>三等分任何一角　並非難題　讀者投函本報申述</h3>

<h3>長大敎務長　張德馨意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十二日電〕長大敎務長張德聚博士，頃就中央社六日所發表上海楊嘉如君對世界七大科學疑題之一之「三等分任何一角」獲得解答一事，表示懷疑。渠認爲僅以直尺圓規儀器三等分任意一角爲不可能，張氏曾於德國研究數理多年，並獲柏林大學數學博士學位。他說：在數學上，若欲用直綫之長代表數或用數表示直綫長，必須先將軍位長規定好，然後可用圓規作一單位圓，即可隨便　任何一角，用直尺國規作出與此角餘弦相當之直綫長，反之，有了一角的餘弦長，亦可將此角作出，只要此角不超過一百八十度。他又說：一百二十度的角是容易用直尺圆規作出的，他的直弦負二分之一也很容易作出，若是一百廿度的角可用直尺圓規三等分之，當然就是四十度的餘弦，應該可以用直尺圓規作出，但是事實不然。張氏說：我可以用Y代替四十度的餘弦，由三角公式不難推出一百廿度的餘弦等於四與Y的立方相乘减去三倍Y用二乘，此等式再用負二分之三代替一百二十度的餘弦，即得負一等於八與Y的立方相乘减去六倍Y，若用X代替二Y，再將負一遷項即得X的立方减去三倍X加一不等於零，這是三個三次方程式，根據方程式論的一偭定理，可知這個方程式最少有一個實數根，再根據另一個定理，得知這個方程式的任何根，都不爲有理數。張氏最後肯定的說：若是一個以爲有理數爲係數的三次方程式的根，不爲有理數，則與此根相當之直綫長，就不能用直尺圓規作出，因X旣不能作出，而X等於X的一半，故Y也不能作出，Y爲四十度的餘弦，因四十度的餘弦不能作出，故四十度的角也不能作出。張氏繼批評楊嘉如氏之任何一角稱：一百廿度的角旣然也能三等分，當然六十度三十度十五度七度半等等的角也不能作，有了這些不能作出的角，當然可以說用直尺圓規不能三等分任意一角，但不可將此任意一角改爲「任何一角」，因爲一百八十度九十度四十五度二十二度半等等的角，是可以用直尺圓規三等分的，然而這不能說是「新發明」。</p>

<h3>銀根緊·交易稀　棉紗布普遍下挫　紡建循例開紗售價未動</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，紡建公司照常開售，配價未動，市塲情勢因銀根轉趨緊俏，客帮辦胃呆滯，本街各方及廠家袖手，且有同業斬售，塲內交易阻滯，做價步入疲途。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗，比之週末續跌三十萬，低爲六千一百廿萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，亦均步小一百萬至一百五六十萬元　棉布市况，晨開以週六紡建大量開售，同業銀根軋緊，散戶吐出頗多，更受改革幣制傳言，人心甚虛，紗布辦理登記買方大都觀望，市勢盤旋下游。迨近收市，因染廠家對白坯布稍有抵補，徐州蚌埠等客帮亦有少數收吸，價微見回堅。但最後十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，一致　挫自一萬五千至二萬五千元。全日趨勢，除漂布粗布及色布士林布市氣挺俏外，其餘各布脚地大都平疲。</p>

<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市堅穩，同行交易有二十餘担，做開A字等級五担，價一億〇七百萬元，C字等級五担，價五百萬元，D字等級有十餘担成交，價四百萬元，均有七天期頭，實銷甚爲淸淡。零担做開甚稀，高零担在三百萬元左右，老虎灶絲成交價爲九千八百萬元。干經殊乏交易，普通零担，喊價在四五百萬元之間。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>

<h3>公債劇升　外股平庸</h3>

<p>外股昨未見特色，平庸而已，港電回長至三元，業外刺激已吿消滅，怡紗晨開六五萬，退至六二萬五而後轉平。廣帮出，證券帮則進，較上週六計英聯紙版尙平，業廣跌半成，會德豐怡紗微升，怡啤航業鋼業微挫。</p>

<p>渠稱印度商人比較喜歡購買中國紡織品，　其可由棉花直接交換也。然渠亦提出警吿稱，以後印度棉花之輸出，可能减少。</p>
<h3>茶市堅定</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，出口商之胃納呆頓如故，然過程受外匯再度調整之關係，比上週更覺蓬勃，價格方面，復又砌加不已，底盤亦頗穩固。至於本街與客帮吸取之各種內銷茶，刻下買氣依然濃郁，而執貨者仍一味居爲奇貨，供應步趨凋零，是以賣買賡續失調，交易狹隘未暢，情勢則迭吐秀氣。</p>

<h3>論科學的價值</h3>
<p>— 洪謙</p>
<p>我們如談到科學的價値問題，往往聯意到牠的用處。好似科學野於實際生活之有無「用處」，即爲科學之有無價値的標準。這不是我們信口的說來，就是德國科學家W．Ostwaldl在他的「自然哲學槪要」中也曾提到這一點：「科學知識的價值，無論為過去為現在，各在　的普遍的「用處」。知識的追求，科學的研究，以其本身為目的，而不顧及其他實際上的效用。如所謂爲知識而求知識。爲價理而求眞理者。完全出於唯心論的謬見，但是，如此可就减小了不少科學的價値了。」</p>
<p>Ostwald這樣科學的價値觀念，自然有其事實上的根據。就是我們因談科學的價値而聯想到牠的「用處」，也不是完全無理由的。的確，科學的知識，甚至於科學無論在起源上或發展上，均與人類的實際坐活有密切的關係。我們即從幾何學觀之，幾何學」詞就包含了「大地測量」的意義；天文學的基本槪念和實地觀察，是溯源於預言家在職業上的需要;化學的分析，開始是爲了「煉金法」的效果。就是許多素偏於理論硏究而不以實際「用處」爲念的科學理論，終於也問接的給社會上生活上以莫大的貢獻。譬如Faraday的研究，何嘗想到電氣工業上的問題，其對於現代電氣工業的影響如何？Pastenr的研究，也是純粹理論的，但是其給果對於現代醫華治療的作用如何？鐳的發明，誰知其光射能治療癌症？以外許多科學技術方面的發明，究全出於適應實際生活的要求，出於當時社會的需要，更是顯而易見的了。</p>
<p>雖然我們從「用處」上輸科學的價値，不無理由，不無根據，但並未具充足的理由和充足的根據。因爲我們假如對於科學的價値有所判斷，事實上就是我們想指出牠在當代社會環境中和個人生活內所具的「文化意義」如何；同時牠在某個時代裏所得的「文化意義」，就是科學的某種價値觀念的標準和內容。我們能從「用處」上判斷原始時代人類知識的價値！因爲在那個時代我們對於知識的看法，只能說是純粹爲生存的，爲生存之所需要的。知識在那時代的「文化意義」，最多我們只能稱之爲一種「維持生存」的工具吧？我們亦能從「用處」上去判斷初期文化的人類知識：因爲那個時代的知識作用，也是不出乎有關實際生活範國之外。所以牠在文化上的意義，除了爲生存競爭的方法以外，亦毫無其他的意義可言。但是我們專從「用處」上以判斷經過若千又化發展階段而後形成的科學知識，則就根本不可能的了。</p>
<p>我們之所以認爲專從「用處」上判斷當代的科學知識或科學者，即因我們今日所見到的科學知識理論，以及其在文化上的作用，旣不是如原始時代之爲一種「維持生存」的工具，也不是如文化初期中之爲「生存競爭」的方法，而是在實際的「用處」之外，還有牠的新的作用和新的意義了。當代偉大的發見如相對論量子論，對於實際生活有直接「用處」麽？是一種維持生存的工具麽？是一種「生存競爭」的方法麼？關於這些代表時代的科學理論，我們不只無法從「用處」上以判斷牠的價値;就是牠的理論本身以及對於人類精神思想上的影響，也非專講「用處」的人們所能了解所能認識的了。</p>
<p>就從這一點而言，我們已能明瞭今日之所謂科學，事實上久已脫離專爲「達到生存目的的方法」了，已經久已成了一種獨立的目主的，有本身目的的活動了。道就是我們上面所謂現代科學具有的新的意義和新的作用。其實在社會文化的發展中，不只是科學的進化歷程如此，就是其他的事物，甚至於整個人類文化的發展，亦莫不是如此的。譬如無論「視」「聽」「言」「行」在過去最顯明的是一種「維特生存」的工具，「生存競爭」中的必需品，現在久已發展到成了一種「文化生活」中的必然現象了，因爲我們所謂　於藝術意義的「觀摩」，也是「視」之一種；所謂富於欣賞意義的「傾聽」，也是「聽」之一種，所謂具有精神意義的「歌唱」「舞蹈」何嘗不是「言」之一種「行」之一種呢？諸如此類的例子，誠是舉不勝舉。不過我們已能由之而明白，任何一種文化社會的形成和發展，皆不外首先脫離了專爲「達到生存目的的方法」而成了一種獨立的自主的，有本身的目的的活動或作為。</p>
<p>所以我們如正確了解科學的價値，或者說了解科學的新的文科學，無論爲文學詩歌音樂藝術，甚至於「觀摩」「傾聽」「歌唱」「舞蹈」，都能使我們生活興趣增高，人生的意義　滿，都能滿足我們理想中的欲求，都能充實我們體驗中的境界的。文學家詩人藝術家音樂家，各有各的境界，如所謂文學境界，詩的境界，藝術的境界，以及音樂的境界，同樣的，科學家也有他的科學境界，科學家之所以孜孜不息的爲知識眞理之追求之所以「為知識而求知識，為眞理而求眞理」者，正如文學家詩人藝術家音樂家之欲充實和擴張，甚至於創造他們的文學境界詩的境界藝術的境界音樂的境界的目的相同。Ostwald身爲科學家，而不知科學也有其獨立的境界，於是認爲「為知識而求知識，爲眞理而求眞理」是唯心論的謬見，眞不知是因之而减少了科學之爲科學，「不少的價値了」。</p>
<p>綜以上所言而論：無論爲科學知識或科學的優値，都不專在於「用處」。科學對於人類社會的「用處」或「普遍的用處」，雖然也能代表科學價值的一部分，但並不能代表科學價値的全體。正如應用科學對於當代文明的貢獻固多，但並不能代表科學的價値的全體者相同。我們一般的人以及Ostwald對於科學價値的看法，之所以充足的理由或根據者，之所以不能成為眞正的科學價値的觀念者，即因蔽於知識在過去社會文化中的地位，而忽視了在現今社會文化中的地位，因蔽於科學在物質生活方面的價値，而忽視了在精神生活情感生活方面的價値了。德國哲學家Voihinger對於科學之所以為科學一點，在他的「好似哲學」中說得好：「科學的研究，是有其本身的興致和樂趣的，這樣的與致和樂趣是包括在科學本身之內，而決非從牠的應用方面所能分析的。世人多認爲科學爲實際一切應用上的技術或工具的製造廠。這個錯誤的科學觀念，不知道是故意侮辱科學，或者是根本不知科學嚴格的說，科學是一種奢侈品，不過這樣的奢侈品是高貴的人類所必需的，也是在人類文此社會中所必需的，這樣對於人類文化具有高貴意義的奢侈品，自然不只是科學，此外還有哲學文學詩揪音樂藝術等等呢」！</p>
<h3>大學八條目新解</h3>
<p>— 君羊</p>
<p>大學一篇有所謂「三綱領」「八條目」者。囊已有文釋「三綱領」矣，今請更就「八條目」作一新解，以質學者。</p>
<p>明明德於天下者，人君推已及人之事，蓋其心感通之德，所謂「仁」者，有以深覺夫人我之一體，徒明其在我之德，而不爲人謀，輒若其事有未盡，於我有所不足也者，則必有以使天下之人皆自明其德焉。然而天下者，國之合也，故必先之以治國，國者家之積也，又必先之以齊家；家者，身之聚也，復必先之以修身。身之修不修，乃在動靜云爲之間；　身之主在心；然則動時云　　　於身，心實有以區　　左右之，心不正，　亦弗可得而修，故曰：「欲修其身者，先正其心。」心之發動而兌於思慮者爲意;心者，意之統體耳。　者，天地之至通定理；意誠云者，謂心之所思慮，莫非大地之至道定理，而無　介之虛妄雜乎其中也。「欲正其心者，先　其意，」蓋意，心之部分，心，意之全體，未有部分不誠，而全體能識者;而所調正心，即誠心耳。「知，」猶知識也，知道識理，所以為誠。「致」至也，極也；知識不至於極，則其誠有未盡，故曰：「欲誠其意者，先致其知。」所謂「致知在格物」者，「格，」及也，窮也;「物，」統事物而言。道理寓於事物，欲知道識理，必於事物之間求之。知不及物，則所知虛而無據？汝物回去窮其理，則所識偏而不全。凡格物，致知，誠意，正心，修身，皆所以自明其德，自新之事也；若夫齊家，治國，平天下，則所以使人自明其德，新民之功已。而格致所以明夫至善,知也;誠正修齊治平，所以達乎至善，行也。</p>
<p>「自天子至於庶人，臺是皆以修身為本」者，修身實　格致誠正而言，此五者之事備，則不失為善人，退有以立己，進有以立人;立己為民，立人為君，為民者進而可以為君，為君者退而可以為民，夫非民主政治之眞意也欺？故曰，儒家之政治理想，所謂王政者，貌雖有君，其意則民主也已。「其本亂而末治者……」云云，「本」謂己，「末」謂人。蓋吾儒以倫理為政治之本，治道之要在於培育善材，出而推其所以修已者而治人，中庸曰「爲政在人，」即其意已。茍不敎養其民，使之各盡修已之事，而徒以刑政道而齊之，則來日秉政者，悉皆今日免而無恥之民，所望於其民者，亦不過免而無恥之治，寖假必及於亂，此無他，其本旣亂，欲末其末之治，不可得也。「其所摩者薄，而所薄者厚」者，「所厚」言家，「所薄」當國與天下·夫為政在於行仁　，行仁之方，推愛而已。人之所愛莫過於家，為政之道，在使天下之人推其所以愛家者，而愛國，而愛天下。苟薄於家，斯愛之源塞，將燕以爲推而及於國於天下。吾需務本之論，蓋深明夫人性，　就其　發而利導之。人性惟何？各愛其家是已。利導又何？明夫人我之同生於天地，人性我性之並出於天理，人我原屬一體，充其愛家之愛而愛國天下，亦在爲與不爲，願與弗願之間耳。反之，人而不能愛其家，而求共愛國，愛天下，斯則拂性之事，故日「未之有也。」</p>
<h3>由具體到抽象</h3>
<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>「具體」「抽象」兩名詞是由西洋介紹來的。「具體」，英文原字是Concute；「抽象」，英文原字是Abstract。Concute原於拉丁字Concutus，Concutus是動字（Verb）Concuscere的分詞（Past　partlciple）,指凝合的意思。Abstract原於拉丁字Abstractus，Abtractus是動字Abstrahere的分詞，指抽取的意思。意義的引伸，凡凝台成體，有形象可以感官接者，叫做具體；凡抽取形象，感官所不能接，只用心官去想的，叫做抽象。</p>
<p>如常前一件東西，可以看得見，摸得着，這叫做具體的，存於心裏的槪念，如「白」，如「方」，看不見，摸不着，而只能想的，這叫做抽象的。「白」的槪念，「方」的槪念，是由某時某地的一件東西裏抽出來的，某時某地的一件東西，受常時當地的時間空間所限制，是特殊的;由其中所抽出來的，如「白」與「方」之概念，受不時間空間的限制，這是普遍的。特殊的必是單獨的，如這張桌子，只是這一張;普遍的却是無數的，如桌子，凡桌子全包括在內，任何時候和任何地方的桌子都叫做桌子。又如人之墜樓，水之就下，這是一件一件墜下的事實，是特殊的;至於地心吸力，能够包括所有隊下的事實，這是普遍的原理。因此我們說：物與事是具體的，也是特殊的，理與例是抽象的，也是普遍的;感官上對於一物一事的知覺是具體的，也是特殊的，思想上關於事物的理與例的概念是抽象的，也是普遍的。我們中國有「形而上者謂之道，形而下者謂之器」（易獎辭上第十二）的話，「形而上」即抽象，「形而下」即具體，「道」即理與例，「器」即物與事。</p>
<p>抽象的能力是人類所固有的，也是人類所特有的。人類有文化，關鏈就在此。文化愈進步，抽象的能力愈高。人類抽象的能力首先見於語言，語言算是人類在文化上最早的作品，語言的基本原　是動詞與名詞。動詞名詞是人類所創造的抽象的符號，用以代表具體的事物，和事物的動與態（Actron　and　state）。名詞與動語合而成語句，用語句來記載經騐，傳　經騐。（所謂經騐，即人類對於事物及其動態的經歷。）經騐因記載而能貯積，因傳　而能交換;文化的連積，進步，與傳播，全靠語言（合文字而言）的功用。</p>
<p>人類有語言，才能有學問。學是自己所得的經騐，問是微取他人的經騐。自己的經騐，菲語言不能積貯，他人的經騐，非語言無法徵取;所以說，有語言然後有學問。</p>
<p>學問的工作在求普遍而抽象的理例，這種理例是由人類所經歷到的特殊而其體的事物汝其動態之間求得的。其目的，一方面是滿足求知的欲望，一方面是適應實際的須求。事物及其動態是散的，繁的，變的，以有涯的人生，有限的知力，短促的記憶，不能一一經歷，不得已而行其方便：即散中求總，繁中求簡，變中求常；所求而得的結果，理與例便是。而宇宙的安排，不但散中有總，繁中有簡，變中有常，並且總能攝散，簡能御繁，當能衡變，於是人類所求得的理與例，滿足了知識欲以外，還可拿來「利用」，以收「厚生」的效果。因此，學問有知與行兩方面的，知方面的學問如現代的純粹科學（Pure　sclence），行方面的學問如現代的應用科學（Applicsd　science）。純粹科學所探討的是特殊而具體的事物上的普遍而抽象的理例，應用科學所研究的是如何把這種理例實施於各事各物之中，而得實際的好處。</p>
<p>總而言之，人類知力的發展，文化的進步，是由具體而抽象的。起於感官所接的特殊的事物，到於心官所想的普遍的理例。所接的事物愈多，所得的理例便愈猜愈確，則所知所識愈深愈廣;反過來，所得埋例愈精確，所接的事物就愈多，則宰制環境的功效愈大。整個文化的演進，總是在具體而抽象，抽象而其體的路錢上，往復不已的進行着。</p>

<h3>學林叢話</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>建軍要義</p>
<p>現代武力實際就是全體國力的表現。建軍與建國理無一致。沒有建國宏遠的規模，則建軍“的絕　達到，建軍若不與建國理想相適應，不但耗竭國庫，而且治絲愈紊。建國需要有四種力量，即人力，物力，學力，最後還有通德的力量，可以稱為四　柱石，建軍要義當亦不外乎是。</p>
<p>美國馬歇爾將軍以爲常備軍過多，不適於現代民治國家，他主張對靑年　施軍事訓練，使全國有無限的兵源，以補常備軍之不足。這件事中國應從容準備，求其實效。軍訓不僅指現代武器的基本訓練，學科應與術科兼顯並重，國防部與敎育部宜作周詳設計，不可漫為設施。普遍電訓固然是建軍的根本要圖，目前就治標言，即現在數百萬軍人的敎育問題，已足稱爲中國歷史上空前偉大的成人敎育計畫。其中包含了三方而，第一應實施基本敎育，以掃除文盲。第二應使其了解本國史地與國際形勢，以培養公民常識。第三應授以造屋，　渠，園藝，工藝等實際知識，養成退伍以後的就業能力。軍事敎育應與軍隊生活相配合，並宜富於變化，以增興趣，如音樂，藝術等高尙娛樂，亦不容忽視。將來師資問題必大惑困雖，移校就兵或移兵就校之原則，均可試驗。時間應如何支配，是否可於每週內抽出一天稱爲敎育日，凡此之類，均宜參考他國已試之效以作借鏡。以上所述，我們不可視爲陳義太高，這是提高國民生活水準的起點。</p>
<p>物力問題，凡全國資源之開發，莫不與國防有關。强兵之道應寓於富國之中。浩大之軍費非國庫所能負擔，故民間企業應使其可迅速改爲軍用，軍用者亦可迅速改爲民用。惟有武備，方能抵戰。戰時美國稱爲民主國家之兵工廠，飛機生產年逾萬架，其飛機所需之鋁，運用田納西河之電力以供製造者佔百分之六十，轟炸機炸彈原料之硝酸　，亦多取給於是。T．V．A．制本爲一種地方　濟建設，平時有益於民生，戰時有裨於國防，富强之業同出一源。現代戰爭是科學戰爭，科學上的進步與造詣使整個戰略隨之改變。國家之運命可謂擊於科學研究，科學爲種子，發明爲果實。物力僅是一種潛力，有了學力才能變爲實力。馬歇爾硏究院遠比兵工廠爲重要，兵工廠內雖充滿了武器軍實，不久使成老朽不堪再用。邱吉爾曾稱未來之帝國爲心智之帝國。（Empires　of　Mind）,心智較遜者雖千仞高尚不足言固，萬里鯨波不足言　但普通人常以爲科學專靠理智，實則眞正科學精神無不合有崇高的道德在內。試以雷達（radar或radiolocation）爲例，雷達爲以無綫電方法測定位置與距離之儀器，可譯爲窺測儀。此種儀器可用以窺測敵人飛機與潛水艇的踪　，而加以擊退，又能透過雲霧作極準確的投彈　炸。它不但是戰時海陸空三軍攻守兼施最有效的新武器，對於戰後海運空運的安全問題亦大有供獻。雷達之發明實在由於精神與技術交相爲用的結果。雖有科學家平時之精硏爲其基礎，若非他們在戰時矢動矢勇，羣策羣力，恐無補於戰時急切之需要，此其一。政府對學術硏究有寬大而開明之方針，學者亦赤誠愛國，保守機密，政府與學府其有充分合作精神，此其二。英人華會華特（Robert　Wotson　Wott）曾謂軍事家工業家與科學家之密切合作爲英國眞正之秘密武器。(見氏著需達與戰爭及和平之關係一文，載於自然周刋一九四五年九月十五日）又凡一種新發明欲應用於作戰，必有賴於新人才之養成。人才的訓練與組織，非有道德無以領導，此其三。重大戰略雖由軍人設計，但主持軍國大計者應爲政治家而非軍人。在國防與外交上必須有舉國一致之精神，國防計劃與外交方針之決策，必須超出於政　利益之上·非有君子，何能立國？此其四。以上所述都是第二次大戰　貴之敎訓與經騐，非深切體會歷史敎訓，起而力行，無以建軍，亦無以建國。</p>

<h3>婚姻大事</h3>
<p>— 元亮</p>
<p>省主席底兒子與省府秘書長底內姪女聯姻，總算是門當戶對天成佳耦了。你看六日中央日報登載的西康省主席劉文輝長公子與四川省府秘書長鄧漢祥底內姪女　婚的新聞，不但他們底地位令人仰慕，而舖張的程度也實在値得全世界底人驚羨！且看過禮等節目：</p>
<p>「所有禮物裝滿二百抬盒，自北門新玉沙街劉公館，綿延達二三里，夾道參觀之市民，摩肩接踵，人山人侮，禮物中僅枕頭一項，即達四百對，約値一億五千萬元，瓷器共値十億，其中有宮燈四架，係用四十八兩黃金製成，並鏤嵌珠寳。劉氏快壻伍培英，則贈送八寳鑲金錢門簾一幅，光彩奪目，價値連城，預定酒席計一百六十桌，付定金三千餘萬元，並準備有夜點百餘桌，每桌點心費即値匹十六萬元，此外並備有大批高貴手帕，分送各親友（下略）」</p>
<p>婚姻是終身大事，固然不能隨便草率，不過，如此舖張，是否太過？筆者不瞭解川康習俗，枕頭是不是要天天換？</p>
<p>試問結一次婚要這許多東西幹什麼？除了「擺闊」之外，此外更有什麽意義？提到這位公子劉元彥，雖已二十八歲，郤尙在華西大學社會學系攻讀，新娘胡問渠，也在一起攻讀，都不是生產的人，當然這些禮物無非是家長給預備的。政府三十令五十申地敎人民厲行節約，省主席秘書長是全省人民底最高表率，不但不領導節約，竟變本加厲，一至於此！全國有上億凍餒中的難民嗷嗷待哺，京滬大學生在寒風中奔走嘶喊，捐募寒衣，大槪未必是讀社會學系的新人們所不知道的罷？</p>
<p>月前英國伊麗莎白公主底婚禮，因爲時値非常，所以儘管以皇儲之尊，也祗好一切從簡。想不到中國省主席底公子結婚有這等威風。　怎會不令國際側目而視！</p>
<p>瘡痍滿目的中國偏會有層出不窮的怪事，我希望是報紙在造謠言，開玩笑，但看報上說得活靈活現，又不像是揑造的。婚期是十二月二十七日，已經過了十天，並未見政府有何動靜，監察老爺們，倘若連這種喪心病狂的事也不管，還談什麽民主？</p>
<h3>聲音萬能</h3>
<p>— 天視</p>
<p>「聲音」若在聽覺範圍以上，即成爲一種具有極大能力的科學上工業上及醫學上的重要工具。利用「聲音」作工，現在已不是一件希罕的事。</p>
<p>大家知道「聲音」的發生是由於一種機械式的震動。普通人耳膜所適宜的震動次數（即頻率）約爲每秒二十週至一百十週，過此則尖銳燥雜，不堪一聽。　新的發音器能發出每秒一二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇週的高頻率聲波，這種聲波更有許多希奇百怪的用途。</p>
<p>現在美國很多工廠已普遍利用「聲音」檢查巨大金屬鑄品的內部裂孔。密契根大學學授法斯東發現金屬鑄品內部如無裂孔，則聲波透過以後可藉回聲加以檢波而擴大，如有裂孔，則在裂孔處之回聲產生較速，且得照相於銀幕以鑑定其位置，故凡巨大鑄品如輪船推進軸，機動車軸等重要機件，用此法檢驗，確可便捷不少。</p>
<p>許多牛奶棚利用聲波調勻牛乳，並加以殺菌，辦法為：使牛乳流過正在發出高頻率聲波之鋼片，大部份細菌均被聲波擊死，較大之脂肪塊粒被擊粉碎，使宜於腸胃消化，醫界權威咸認此種牛乳對嬰孩尤其相宜。</p>
<p>科學家對於聲波在食物的殺菌功用上曾寄以重大的希望，經不少次實驗室試驗，聲波對於食物的殺菌　功用確已有相當的成就。</p>
<p>還有一種美國剛薩斯州出品的「自動門」，也是利用聲音的力量而裝設，進門時祗需一掀電鈕，即可產生一種頻率極高的聲波，推動機件，將門拉開，並同時開亮電燈。</p>
<p>至於利用聲音驅霧，也已試驗成功，對於航空和航海可以减去不少困難與危險，辦法是將聲波向霧發射，數秒鐘之內迷霧化為細雨而消失。</p>
<p>傳蘇聯料學家利用聲波，帮期農產物種十的成長，據報吿稱經試驗後的農產物，收成有的增加，蕃薯發芽提早一星期，收成約增爲百分之四十至五十，豌豆亦較早萌芽，收成竟加二倍。如果此項消息不謬，則將來解決世界糧荒的功臣就是「聲音」了。</p>
<p>還有利用聲波帮助洗濯衣服的，因爲高頻率的聲波通過衣服維維時將所有附着的塵埃帶出，並促使油汚與肥皂液混合，一位支加哥商人最近已申請專利製造「眞空聲波洗衣器」。</p>
<p>在塔克薩斯州某碳墨廠將一種特製的聲波發射器裝置在烟囱裹面，使經烟囱外逸的微小碳粒互相碰擊後重又墮下，這樣可以减去不少浪費，他如化學廠，礦穴，裝置此種聲波發射器，用以减少損失和避免危險者甚多。</p>
<p>聲波旣有如此驚人的威力，若用於破壞方面，其恐怖自亦不亞於原子炸彈，軍事科學家現正積極把它發展成為一種殺人武器，以備在未來大戰應用，據現在所知，如把大量聲波集中發射，則在距離六十米以內可將人在三十四至十秒鐘間殺死，即在三百米之外，也可能重傷。</p>
<p>總之，「如何利用聲波」是科學界一個新的課題，現在的成京有限，研究工作還在萌芽期中，將來的發展尙待全球科學家繼續努力，至對於世界文明是禍是福，却要看人類的命運如何了。</p>
<h3>吴佩孚与徐世昌</h3>
<p>— 凌霄漢閣</p>
<p>日本製造各式傀儡以分散中華，需要選擇許多對象，華北之王克敏並不够格，只爲經濟熟手，隨時利用利用，而眞正之目的則有二人，一爲吳佩孚，一爲徐世昌，皆於二十八年先後死去，爲敵氛壓制下之犧牲者。</p>
<p>吳佩孚在北方軍政界以及老百姓心理上，是有偶像資格的，其人發誓不入租界，居住北平東四牌樓之什錦花園，其北之獅子胡同，即倭軍總部所駐地，恰在密邇的　「矮簷」之下。倭酋時時注意。事變前一年，吳氏曾以個人名義致電日本天皇，勸阻侵略，雖於事實無益，而倭皇（即裕仁）於吳名已有深刻之印象，故屢詢華北一局，何以無吳佩孚？時僞「臨時政府」成立已一年有半矣，將由「臨時」而「正式」則王克敏等無此資格，故若老吳慨諾，「華北國」實現，則「王家老店」勢必撤陣讓吳，正如江南之梁鴻志，雖爲所謂「維新政府」的頭目，而汪精衛一出，梁即祗能降居一院長，都是資格問題。</p>
<p>吳氏本人自民國九年庚申討段討安福部，即以段黨親日賣國而舉旗。至九一八事變，又屢以「手握數十萬大兵，坐棄三省」嚴責張學良氏，至此欲其一旦躬行「大賣國」，自屬人情所不能有。老段昔雖親日，然「九一八」後，尙能由日租界避往上海，對於日人請求出山，直吿以須先交還三省！小張雖失三省，終究不會降敵。况老吳雖舊軍閥，亦有其崛强之本質，在敵氛包圍之下，談起新組織，亦以敵軍全部退出國境為第一條件。日人則斷章取義，抹去「條件」的話真以贊成新組織，「掩耳盜鈴」，打算就此捧上台去，並舉行一個招待各界大會，請吳氏宣布「和平」大方針。及期，吳氏果被簇擁而出，當衆致詞，開口便敎訓日本，滔滔不絕，左右見情形不對，急命預伏之攝影者，將全景速入鏡頭，一面將吳氏由「其語未畢」之狀態中，挾之後退，更囑各報記者不可照錄吳語，後將照片洗出，另以代撰之演詞發刊。此一幕怪劇，亦够上「駭疾」二字，吳氏從此即被隔離，未幾而以病聞，以拔牙變症聞，以逝世聞，繼之以大出喪等等。在吳氏如此收塲，不失爲硬漢到底。假使此君果如敵人所期，作登塲之傀儡，當有一「華北國」與汪之「華中」的「中華」並峙，僞國府之僞旗？（即加了一條黃綢的靑白旗）決不能過黃河而飄塲。</p>
<p>徐世昌居住津英租界，且以文人身分，故其環境比吳緩和多多。但以北洋領袖，下野總統，而被覬覦試探，已非此八五老人所能堪。忽然日寇發威，將英法租界封鎖，繼以大水泛濫，憂惶焦慮，一病而亡，其人年雖高邁，而素日頤養得法，如不　此變，未遽終天祿也。</p>
<h3>不念舊惡</h3>
<p>— 靜紋</p>
<p>「一團和氣」往往被一般人目爲處世的不二法門。人總是喜歡和氣的，能够與世無事，心平氣和，當然到處受人歡迎，並且或許還能因之「生財」。爲了保全這一團和氣，寗可自己任勞任怨，吃些不虧，語云：「吃虧就是便宜。」即是顧全大局的想法。</p>
<p>然而要凡事心平氣和却也不是一件容易事，這一定得有極深的修養才能，遇到有什麼人一再對你漫無禮貌，不講情理，心理總覺得非常煩悶忿怒，於是勾起昔日積壓已久的難堪，舊恨新仇，一起迸發，這時候便不可收拾，難以遏止了。天下「唾面自乾」威「別人打了你的左頰，把右頰再送上去」的人究竟不多，「以怨報德」的聖人更少。所以自古以來，「不念舊惡」便被推崇爲至高無上的美德。</p>
<p>然而，不念舊惡也有它的限度，並且也應該看一看對方的態度，並不是說把從前所受的恥辱一箍腦拋之九霄雲外，以爲這樣就是氣量宏大，風度卓著。在這個世界裏，固不可以抹殺一切，將人人都看作心懷不測忘恩負義的傢伙，但如果把人人都看作菩薩心腸慈悲爲懷的好人，則自己也就不能立足而必將在生存競爭下被時代所淘汰。這並不是說我們應該專以小人的手段來對付他人，而是說為自衛計，不得不從壞處想想。「養虎貽慮」，毒蛇反噬的事，比比皆是，何况所謂不念舊惡者，是鼓勵他人改過自新棄邪歸正的意思，「放下屠刀」固然可能「立地成佛」，但是假使對方屠刀尙未放下，你就貿貿然的捐棄成見，不念舊惡，結果一定就是對方的得寸進尺！</p>
<p>但是，最可怕的倒並不是一味不念舊惡，而是根本忘了從前曾經吃過的虧和上過的當，不是風度泱泱，而是健忘糊塗。百年十年在歷史上可以說是一個極短的期間，但是一個健忘的人會把昨天的敎訓丟得一乾二凈，糊塗的人在一隻手被火灼傷了之後竟會把第二隻手再伸進火熖裏去！如果這個健忘糊塗的老先生還不以自己的健忘糊塗為意，並且更自詡這種健忘精神的偉大，那末這位先生用上海土語稱之，便是實足的「曲」得不可救藥了。</p>
<h3>酒癖</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>俗語：「江山易改，本性難移。」這是說一個人的癖好係出自天性，很不容易改移過來的。事實的確也是如此，只要他是人而不是神，就很少不有與生以俱來的癖好。其癖好的好壊，見仁見智，並沒有一定的標準；也許甲認爲是要不得的，而乙倒認爲那正是人生一樂也的事悄。反正「道不同不相爲謀」，科學家猶承認世間無絕對的眞理，又何况個人區區的癖好呢？譬如嗜酒，便屬一例，因談酒癖。</p>
<p>在中國，酒是常與文人結不解之緣的，借杯酒以澆胸中塊壘，也正是古往今來文人的用以發洩牢騷的好方法。雖然「借酒澆愁愁更愁」，醉後狂言不休或是一睡了之，但未始不失爲一個暫時麻醉自我的法門。而且，誰都知道酒是種興奮劑，它有時的確也能够促進人的靈感，促進你的文思。因此，古代文人之嗜酒者也就特別的多。</p>
<p>人人知道「李白斗酒詩百篇」。李白「下筆千首，倚馬可待」的文才，是大大的得力於酒的。而後來之有文才而染有李白同樣的酒癖底文人，也往往給人譽爲「謫仙」。</p>
<p>自然，酒後失態，赤裸裸的還其本來面目，更爲嗜酒的人在所不免的。有人所謂「醉後顚蹶醒時差，總藥催人不自由。」也可算得」語破的的個中話。至於借酒侮人，那當然又當別論了。時至今日，物價飛漲，生活迫人，其猶能「三杯在手」的，恐怕已經不可多得了。不知一般嗜酒的文人們，在如何打發他們無醉的歲月哩！</p>
<h3>「切腹」在中國</h3>
<p>— 田公</p>
<p>年紀輕輕的靑年張德全，在經在抗戰期問輾轉於內地各鐵路綫爲監工而苦鬥過來，如今克「以利刃切腹，鮮血直冒屋頂，復倒洒滿身」，遺書「要求以鐵管會公務員名義葬之」。（事見申報一月九日台灣通訊）</p>
<p>讓這樣一段新聞，可注意的是兩點：即他的死法之慘酷與要求的沉痛。切腹，在我國很少見到，不免覺得有點離奇。我只知道日本傳統的自殺方法之中，有切腹那麽一回事，但那是所謂武士道的一種表現，只有他們一向認爲與其受辱，不如切腹，或者認爲與其在被俘後受苦楚，不如爽爽快快的切腹而死。然而，這種傳統的切腹精神在日本都已經不大流行了的今日，何以反在被日本統治了五十年的台灣的中國公務員身上出現？又何以反而在收復了兩年以後的今日的台灣行政機關內出現？在接收物資和接收人心之外，難道也該接收日本式的切腹嗎？殘酷的日本軍人雖是守舊得可笑，可是他已經逐漸脫去了五百年來所背負的切腹的舊數，分明已在採取只許殺人不許自殺的精神，試看這一回打了敗仗後，日本依然抱着東山再起的意圖，便可明白這一點，這是値得我們任何人提高警覺的。記得從前有一部分日本野心家狂妄地說過：「與其被中國打敗，寗願進攻一個像俄羅斯那樣的强敵，而在眞正第一流的火拼中滅亡。」這自然是一種虛僞狂妄的預言，不足掛齒，但這句話在今日看來，確然使人感覺到日本人正有着這種心理上的要求與事實上的表現。從另一方面看，我們更該警覺到日本人也許會有一天再度來到中國實行有意無意的自殺，像這一次已經結束了的中日戰爭一樣。小氣的日本人，「復仇」心理是我們所不能不防的。到了那時，他們的野心也許不僅會從個人性的切腹形式中表現出來，而且會從全國性的切腹形式中表現出來吧。</p>
<p>可憐這位靑年公務員見不及此。他只意識着「薪給菲薄，無法瞻養妻小」，他只受辱於「其妻將琵琶別抱」。旣能求死，爲什麼就不能以求死的精神爭求生存？爲什麽就不能以求死的精神爭求事業的發展？為什麼僅僅要求以公務員名義葬掉而不能作進一步的努力，使自己實行國葬或其他更可尊敬的葬儀？嗚呼，此切腹悲劇的所以爲悲劇也！</p>
<h3>半工半讀</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>做學生的終覺得這個學期過得眞慢，讀上這麽多天書，還沒有放假。然而做家長的呢？不用說，年關已近是他（她）們的一件心事，一年二度的學期將要結束，又使他們加上一層煩惱。</p>
<p>本來，無論是公務員或小職員們，對於平時與物價賽跑式的生活，已經感到喘不過氣來，再要加上這麼重的一副擔子—子女們的學費，一般的家長們仆到了，於是子女們失了學。</p>
<p>唯有失了學的學生，才會體味到求學的可貴，求學旣沒有力量，申請助學金因爲人數的太多，希望又極渺茫；就職吧—社會上人浮於事，談何容易？眞有「上天無路，入地無門」之慨！左思右想，上帝不曾創造一批「無所事事」的人，除非他自己情願這樣，否則「天無絕人之路」，此路不通，自有其他生路。</p>
<p>那麽，「半工半讀」可以算窮極無聊的一個辦法了，好在這個方法並不是沒有先例，現在各大學裏有很多的名敎授，社會上有很多的名學者與大實業家們，他們在外國讀書的時候，就都採用「半工半讀」的方法；廻顧中國，這方法也未見得行不通，幾年前的國際飯店不就是徵求大學生當侍應生嗎？再說幾年前的生活程度倒底還不像今日那樣，尙且有不少學生前去應微，那麽最近某鞋店的徵求大學生當店員，正表示社會上需要學生方殷，只要學生們肯屈就！</p>
<p>不過，話又得說回來，眞正要實行起來，困難倒底很多，時間是一個最大的問題，除了暑假寒假以外，今日的學生不會有很空閒的時期讓你去利用，看電影跑跳舞塲那只是富家子弟們的玩意兒！如果實行「半工半讀」，那只好限制在假日中，即使是最低微的職業也願意幹。</p>
<p>學生者，本爲「學」習「生」活者也，勞工神聖，以此充實生活經騐，自食其力，體味父母賺錢的不易，意義深長，一舉而數得，何不加以提倡？</p>

<h3>Kowloon City Incident Suddenly Worsens; Hong Kong Police Actually Shoot Our Residents; Foreign Minister Wang Lodges a Strong Protest with the British Side</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th (Urgent Telegram)] An unexpected incident occurred in Kowloon Old City this morning, where Hong Kong police again took armed action against residents of the temporary shacks in Kowloon Old City. This unfortunate incident has further exacerbated the Kowloon issue. Five of our residents were injured by rifle bullets, and Hong Kong police also used tear gas, injuring several other residents. The incident occurred on the morning of the 12th when fully armed Hong Kong police attempted to enter Kowloon City to continue demolishing houses. Residents, fearing for their safety, came out to resist, but were immediately met with gunfire and tear gas from the Hong Kong police.</p>
<p>Cheung Chung-wu, a representative of the Kowloon Residents Association, was the first to be shot in the head during the resistance. Two of the five injured residents are women, and all have been rushed to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. According to the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Hong Kong authorities did not provide prior notice of their intention to demolish the temporary shacks built by our residents. These temporary shacks were only intended to provide temporary shelter. At the time of the dispatch, a large number of Hong Kong police were still stationed in Kowloon and the urban area, guarding against our impoverished residents rebuilding their homes, and the tear gas fumes had not yet dissipated. According to official investigations, six Kowloon City residents were injured after the Hong Kong police force took coercive action. Their names are as follows: Seriously injured: Leung Chuang, Wong Lai-fung-ying; Slightly injured: Cheung Chung-wu, Cheung Bing-lam, Lau Sam-mui, Sun Yat, etc. Although the exact number of deaths and injuries resulting from the Kowloon City police's use of tear gas and rifles against our compatriots in the city's temporary shacks this morning to force their relocation has been carefully investigated, it has not yet been determined. The Hong Kong government claims that five people are currently receiving treatment, while reliable sources say two are seriously injured and four are slightly injured. According to a villager who witnessed the incident, at least six people were injured, and a child, whose name was not included in the list of deaths and injuries, was also slightly injured. The hospital treating the injured was also unable to provide the necessary information. The head nurse, nurses, and information desk staff at the hospital consistently refused to disclose the number of injured to reporters.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 12th (Telegram)] According to Hong Kong sources: After the incident of Hong Kong police shooting our Kowloon City compatriots, the residents' cries shook the heavens, and the situation was extremely serious. As a result, the Hong Kong side has banned reporters from using Hong Kong-Guangzhou long-distance telephone lines.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 12th (Telegram)] After the wooden huts in the Kowloon Old City area were forcibly demolished by the Hong Kong authorities on January 5, the residents rebuilt about twenty thatched huts on the original site. On the morning of the 12th, the Hong Kong authorities sent 150 police officers to demolish them, leading to a clash with about one hundred residents who occupied the area. The occupants threw stones at the police officers, who retaliated with tear gas, batons, and handguns, resulting in a fierce battle lasting half an hour. Finally, all twenty thatched huts were demolished, leaving only a Chinese national flag on the broken walls and ruins. The area is currently guarded by police officers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th (Telegram)] It is reported that Foreign Minister Wang received a report this afternoon stating that the Hong Kong government had continued to send armed police into Kowloon City and harm Chinese people, which aroused great anger. Minister Wang immediately summoned British Ambassador Sir Steven to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sternly demanded that the London government immediately instruct the Governor of Hong Kong to cease all coercive actions in Kowloon City during this period of negotiation and to no longer allow the police to enter the city. Further discussions will be held after a detailed report on today's incident arrives. Minister Wang also urged the British side to accept all the written requests submitted by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 8th of this month, and the British Ambassador agreed to immediately telegraph the London government. It is also reported that the Ministry has telegraphed Chairman Song of Guangdong to provide necessary relief to the Kowloon City residents who have suffered.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Kowloon City House Demolition Incident: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Protest Letter of the 8th Urges Britain to Pay Attention to the Good Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th (Telegram)] Regarding the Kowloon City incident, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to the British Embassy on the day after the forced demolition occurred, and then on the 8th of this month, it submitted a protest and request to the British government in writing. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs extends its greetings to the British Embassy and states the following: Since the Hong Kong government ordered the Chinese residents in Kowloon City to demolish their houses on November 27, 1947, public opinion in various parts of China has been greatly agitated. In addition to instructing the responsible personnel and the special commissioners stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi to negotiate with the British Embassy and the Hong Kong government on several occasions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed to the British Ambassador to China in person on December 10, 1947, the hope that the governments of China and Britain would value the maintenance and promotion of friendship between the local people and the Hong Kong government, and that the Hong Kong government would also take the same attitude, avoiding any actions that have the opposite effect or are provocative. On January 5 of this year, police and coolies from the Hong Kong-Kowloon Brigade, armed, entered Kowloon City and forcibly demolished dozens of houses of residents in Kowloon City, and arrested two representatives of the wealthy residents. There were no proper arrangements for the poor residents who had no one to turn to, leaving them to sleep in the wilderness without a home. Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to Mr. R.H. Le Mare, Counselor of the British Embassy, on January 6, and stated to the British Ambassador on the same day that the matter was both a treaty issue and concerned with humanitarianism. The establishment of the Kowloon Leased Territory was based on the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1898, which stipulated that "All Chinese officials and troops now stationed in the City of Kowloon shall continue to occupy their present positions therein..." and also stipulated that "it is further understood that no walled city now existing within the Kowloon Extension shall be interfered with." According to this provision, the power of administration over Kowloon City should naturally belong to China, and the British government should not force the residents of the city to move their residences. The Hong Kong government issued a statement on September 15, 1946, stating that from the date the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory came into effect in 1898, Kowloon City was part of the British-leased territory during the lease period and belonged to the scope of British sovereignty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately issued a public statement on September 18 of the same year, reiterating the Chinese government's position that it has never abandoned its administrative power in Kowloon City. The Hong Kong government's coercive action this time in forcing the residents of Kowloon City to move is based on the grounds that the land on which these houses are located belongs to British Royal Government land. This reason clearly disregards China's administrative power in Kowloon City, which it has never abandoned, and the Chinese government will never recognize it. The Chinese government also believes that the Hong Kong government's move to forcibly demolish the houses of Kowloon City residents is also in conflict with the long-standing friendship between China and Britain and their peoples. The Minister of Foreign Affairs reiterated to the British Embassy in China that, according to the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898, the Chinese government still enjoys administrative power in Kowloon City and has no intention of abandoning that administrative power. The Chinese government will never consider legal all measures taken by the British government in the past and in the future that violate the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898. If the British government has a different interpretation of the Convention, it should seek a fair and reasonable solution through normal diplomatic channels. Regarding the Hong Kong government's forced demolition of Kowloon City residences, it is requested that the British government immediately order the Hong Kong government to release the arrested residents' representatives, stop further arrests, and properly resettle the residents who have suffered damage this time. Accordingly, it is requested that you examine this matter, promptly convey it to the British government, and provide a reply.</p>
<h3>Pinyuan County is Prepared to Impose an Economic Blockade on Hong Kong; Resentment is Running High in All Circles in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 12th (Telegram)] The Kowloon City incident is escalating, and various societies and students here are rising up to express their support. In addition to organizing support associations and sending condolences to Kowloon City to express sympathy to the affected compatriots, the Pinyuan County representatives' congress, close to Hong Kong, also resolved to prepare to blockade the periphery of Hong Kong and Kowloon and prohibit the export of goods. Grain merchants, silver and money industry associations, and citizens in Guangzhou have been donating money to relieve the affected compatriots, and the people's resentment has reached its peak.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 12th (Telegram)] It is reported that anti-British slogans have appeared in Guangzhou, but there is no mention of demonstrations like those in Nanjing. A mass meeting was held in Pinyuan County, and it is reported that a resolution has been passed to suspend the supply of food to Hong Kong, otherwise the Hong Kong side must fulfill the following conditions:</p>
<p>Implement compensation for the residents who have been harmed.</p>
<p>Release the two arrested people.</p>
<p>Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Regarding the Kowloon City clash this morning, a Hong Kong government spokesman admitted that the police fired several shots. He emphasized that this was to warn the crowd holding the Chinese national flag to disperse.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Loans May Be Partially Opened</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th (Telegram)] Regarding the issue of opening up industrial and commercial loans, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has consulted with the National Bank to facilitate joint discussion. Some people believe that if loans are opened up in the future, it will be partial. For example, for raw materials for daily necessities, an ordering system will be adopted. As for the loan policy, it will still be implemented in accordance with the "Outline for Loans for Daily Necessities" jointly announced by the Four Banks Joint Treasury last July 4. As for certain transportation equipment that cannot be ordered, it should be opened up.</p>

It was originally scheduled to be submitted to the Political Council on the 13th, but because the original draft is with Chen, who will only return to Nanjing on the morning of the 13th, it is feared that it will not be possible to submit it for discussion.</p>
<h3>An Air Force Plane Crashes in Zhongmu</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 12th (Telegram)] An Air Force "081" transport plane, flying from Shaanxi, caught fire in the oil tank over Zhongmu and crashed into Shaogang Station at noon on the 12th. The plane was destroyed.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanchang, 12th (Telegram)] Minister Bai Chongxi is scheduled to convene a joint meeting on Yangtze River midstream river defense and security in Jiujiang on the 15th.

<p>[This Newspaper, Changsha, 12th (Telegram)] The rumor that a unit of communist bandits near Jianli crossed the Yangtze River and fled south is completely untrue. The lakeshore counties are as peaceful as ever.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th (Telegram)] It is learned from the Executive Yuan that the Hanshui-Yichang River Defense Command has been established in Shashi, which is responsible for presiding over the suppression of bandits by the 2nd Bandit Suppression Column. The column has jurisdiction over 5 regiments of the Hubei Security Force, a unit of the Water Police, and 4 regiments of the Hunan Security Force. The defense of Shashi is consolidated and there is no cause for concern.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanchang, 12th (Telegram)] Bandit activity in the border areas of Guangdong-Jiangxi, Hunan-Jiangxi, and Anhui-Jiangxi is increasing. The bandits in the Guangdong-Jiangxi area have now fled to Guidong in Hunan Province and are planning to flee to Suichuan and Yongxin in western Jiangxi. A band of bandits in Wuyuan on the border of Anhui attacked Fuliang in northeastern Jiangxi. Currently, most of the Jiangxi Provincial Security Regiments are responsible for the defense of northern Jiangxi. The defense of other areas with bandits is deeply felt to be insufficient. Although there is a collective discussion on joint defense with neighboring provinces, it is still felt that a clever woman cannot cook without rice. How to strengthen border defense and pacify the local areas is indeed an important issue for Jiangxi Province at present.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changsha, 12th (Telegram)] The Hunan Provincial Government has scheduled a joint meeting of the general and deputy captains of the self-defense forces of various counties on the 16th to discuss strengthening the security of the counties.

It will not be difficult to annihilate the bandits.</p>

<h3>Expenses for Aid to China and Far Eastern Countries: $440 Million USD – U.S. President Releases Budget Figures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Yanzhijin Mountain, 12th broadcast: President Truman's budget document to Congress (fiscal year 1949) was released on the afternoon of the 12th (1:00 AM, Shanghai time on the 13th), with the following precise figures: The State Department's portion totals $7 billion USD, of which, besides a portion allocated to designated institutions, $4.4 billion USD will be used to aid Europe and other countries. Within this $4.4 billion USD, $4 billion will be specifically allocated to European countries, and $400 million will be allocated to China and other Far Eastern countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman submitted to Congress on the 12th a total budget of $39,669,000,000 USD for the 1948-49 fiscal year to meet actual domestic and foreign needs. This expenditure is an increase of $2 billion USD compared to this year and is unprecedented in peacetime. The main reason lies in implementing an international plan to respond to unprecedented challenges. The President declared: The United States must maintain a higher budget figure until it fulfills its international responsibilities to pave the way for a world of peace and prosperity. Seventy-nine percent of this represents the aftermath of World War II and efforts to prevent World War III, with national defense and foreign aid being the largest components. National defense expenditures require $11.1 billion USD, accounting for 28% of the total, while foreign and other international affairs expenditures require $7 billion USD, accounting for 18% of the total. Expenses for European recovery and aid to China and other countries are $4 billion USD for the former and $440 million USD for the latter. In addition, there are $1.25 billion USD for the occupation expenses of Japan, Korea, and Germany.</p>
<h3>U.S. Figures Advocate Lending Silver to Our Country</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Amid the clamor for currency reform, this reporter recently interviewed someone who returned from the United States to seek their opinion. According to them, most people in the United States hope that our country will use hard currency, especially emphasizing the restoration of silver dollars. Furthermore, many silver mines in the United States have ceased operations, and the national treasury still has 190 million ounces of silver. Currently, among all countries in the world, only India is borrowing silver from the United States. Therefore, if our country were to borrow silver from the United States, it would be easier to succeed. This loan could be for a term of five years. If our country were to restore the silver standard, having one billion ounces of silver would be sufficient for the currency reform.</p>
<h3>National Army in Southern Shanxi Converges on Linfen – Continuously Recaptures Huo County, Zhaocheng, and Hongdong – Main Force in Western Hebei Pursues and Suppresses Communists, Battle Reaches Climax</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 12th] The war situation in Southern Shanxi is about to intensify. The National Army is advancing from both the north and south ends of the Tongpu Railway.

On the 10th, they entered Linfen amidst a warm welcome from all sectors, joining forces with the National Army from the southern route, boosting morale among the military and civilians. The National Army entering Shanxi from the Henan route has made the communist army fearful. After the recapture of Jie County, the communist chiefs in the Yuncheng area, hearing the news, fled north and east.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] The pursuit and suppression battle by the main force in Western Hebei has reached its climax.

The center of the battle shifted from southwest of Baoding to Laishui from the night of the 11th. The communists, with three brigades, launched a surprise attack on Laishui on the night of the 11th, fiercely attacking the city walls several times with extreme intensity. On the morning of the 12th, they broke into the east and west gates. Subsequently, National Army reinforcements arrived, and under a surprise attack, most of the communist forces were annihilated by noon. Two brigades that came to assist were intercepted 20 li southwest of Gaobeidian. The annihilation battle was still in progress as of 3:00 PM. Furthermore, on the Beining line, the section between Beidaihe and Nandasi was repaired on the 12th.

<h3>Northeast War Enters a Period of Lull</h3>

The main force of the enemy is between Xinmin and Faku on the west bank of the Liao River. Furthermore, Li Yunchang's 8th Column is near Tai'an, and the 9th Column is at Sifangtai, 20 kilometers northeast of Liaozhong.

<h3>The Turmoil in the Islamic World</h3>
<p>A delegation of 54 people from the Muslim pilgrimage, since their pilgrimage, has entered Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang, making some reports. Yesterday, they already took special planes sent by the government and flew back to Lanzhou, Dihua, and other places. The gentlemen of the pilgrimage went far to Mecca, a pilgrimage of thousands of miles, not only fulfilling a certain wish in their faith, from which they can be called "Hajji" (Hadi), and hoped by all; but also enough to enhance the understanding between our country and the various ethnic groups in the Islamic world, and strengthen the good relations between China and the various ethnic groups in the Islamic world.</p>
<p>At the time when this pilgrimage delegation is returning from Mecca to their hometown, we are concerned about the turmoil and unrest within the Islamic world, especially deeply. First of all, we want to declare that although there are a large number of followers of Islam within our borders, we are not an Islamic country; precisely because of this, our concern for the situation in the Islamic world does not have any subjective component or other selfish intentions. The current world situation is increasingly divided into two, and under this circumstance, the trend of the Islamic world is really related to the safety of the world. When we discussed the division of the world into two, we said that we are an eastern country, but do not recognize the east-west division of the world. If the world is really divided, the Islamic world is located in the middle of this division, the importance of the Islamic world's position in the current world situation is conceivable.</p>
<p>The Islamic world is really too turbulent now! The partition decision in Palestine not only prompted the conflict between the Arab people and the Jews in Palestine, but also aroused the emotions of the pan-Arab nation. All Arab countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc., have all risen up to support the Arab people of Palestine, and do not hesitate to fight with blood. Currently, there have been repeated armed conflicts between the Arab people and the Jews in Palestine, causing the entire territory to fall into the edge of war. When the British troops withdraw and abandon the mandate, a large-scale struggle will be inevitable. Outside of Palestine, due to the development of the Kashmir situation, India and Pakistan, the two newly established "Dominions," mutually accused each other at the UN Security Council. The Indian Union has criticized Pakistan within the Islamic world in many ways; however, the bloodshed in Kashmir has not stopped at all. This struggle not only hurts the feelings of India and Pakistan, two brotherly countries, but also is related to the overall situation of the world, and cannot be allowed to develop naturally. In addition, the turmoil in Indonesia is not only a problem related only to the Netherlands, but also a link in the turbulent situation within the Islamic world. But the most dramatic seems to be the news from North Africa. According to a report quoting the leader of the Moroccan Independence Party, he said: "If the United States allows France to continue to implement the current oppressive policy in North Africa, we will ask the other side for assistance. Yes, I mean the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>If we examine the reasons why the Islamic world is so turbulent after World War II, it is not difficult to find that one of the main reasons is that the United States, which led the world after this World War II, did not have a clear and firm policy towards the Islamic world. The United States has become a country that leads the world after the war, but what it lacks seems to be an entire world policy on how to lead this world. It may have a policy towards Europe and a policy towards the Far East, but it does not seem to have a whole policy towards the world so far. A policy towards Europe and a policy towards the Far East are only constituent parts of the entire world policy, and they must have their accurate estimates in an entire policy towards the world. Because of this, we have not seen the United States have a clear and firm policy towards the Islamic world until now. In a certain sense, the United States' policy towards the Islamic world can be said to be dependent on its policy towards Europe. It goes without saying in Morocco and North Africa, but the situation is somewhat the same in Palestine. That is to say, in its policy towards Palestine, the United States is somewhat following Britain. The partition plan was originally proposed by Britain, and the United States was making every effort to support it at the UN General Assembly. The Soviet Union originally had its plan for the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, so initially it appeared as a sympathizer of the Arab people, in order to win the favor of the Arab people, but it feared that Palestine would not be chaotic, and on the one hand, it supported the return of the Jews to their country, and finally it came out to support the partition in a posture of compromise with the United States. Its purpose is very obvious. It was unexpected that the United States would have such a decision that did not conform to the wishes of the Arab people under the manipulation of both Britain and the Soviet Union, which could not help but affect its position in the Islamic world. This is really a pity.</p>
<p>We do not seem to have forgotten that Mussolini once called himself the protector of Islam. Although the fascist regime has fallen and Mussolini is no longer alive, we cannot absolutely say that there is no one who wants to call himself the protector of Islam today. We should say that in another world, there are still a large number of worshipers of "Allah" in the Turkmen People's Republic, in the Uzbek People's Republic, and in other People's Republics in another world. If the world is really divided, a part of the Islamic world was already in another world. The talk of the leader of the Moroccan Independence Party, although inevitably contains threats, is also worth our deep consideration. We hope that the United States, which has the responsibility of leading the world, should not despise the problems within the Islamic world, and further make enlightened and wise decisions on the Islamic world, so that the turbulent situation currently appearing in the Islamic world can return to peace.</p>
<h3>Communist Brutal Torture in Northern Jiangsu – "Buying the Flesh of Refugees"</h3>
<p>Inhuman, Unheard of in Ancient and Modern Times</p>

When the country was founded, it relied on the experienced and prudent. How could it wither and decline so quickly, when the years are changing? Reviewing his life, he devoted himself to loyalty and dedication. Heaven did not leave anything behind, and his noble character grieved his peers. From the beginning, his ambition and conduct were outstanding, advocating and tasting revolution, with great theories and majestic writings, opening up the Republic. After experiencing hardships and obstacles, the situation was complex and confusing, and he maintained it with painstaking efforts. Outside, he governed the province; inside, he assisted the central government. He made sound plans and insights, greatly expanding this new model.

<h3>Appendix to the Sino-British Customs Agreement</h3>

<p>A. Vessels with a registered net tonnage of 200 tons or more shall be restricted to loading at any location within the Port of Victoria.</p>
<p>B. Vessels with a registered net tonnage of less than 200 tons shall be restricted to loading at the Western District Public Cargo Working Area [i.e., the mooring area referred to in Section I of Schedule S in the Rules made under the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 1899], or in an area designated by the Harbour Master of Hong Kong in the Yau Ma Tei district, or at Tai Po Harbour.</p>
<p>C. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the Harbour Master shall have the discretion to permit any vessel to load at any other place within the waters of Hong Kong. Where such permission is given, the Harbour Master shall notify the Chinese Maritime Customs [hereinafter referred to as "the Customs"] as soon as possible, and the Customs may, in any such case, have the freedom to verify the shipment of any goods liable to Customs duty on their entry into Chinese territory [hereinafter referred to as "Chinese Customs duty"], provided that the exporter has either paid the duty in Hong Kong or applied for an assessment of the duty in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Customs may freely designate places within the territory of Hong Kong for the collection of Chinese Customs duty or the assessment of the value of goods about to be transported to China. Whether Chinese Customs duty shall be paid or the value shall be assessed in advance at any of the above-mentioned places shall be at the option of the exporter of the goods in question, and the Customs shall inform the exporter concerned of this arrangement. The Customs shall issue a certificate of payment of duty to any merchant who pays Chinese Customs duty in Hong Kong and shall take measures within its organization to ensure that the goods concerned are given priority for clearance at the port of destination within China. The Customs may, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, freely establish inspection facilities in places chosen by it, as close as possible to the typhoon shelters and mooring areas referred to in paragraph 1 (B), and may freely inspect at these places and at other places agreed upon by both parties, goods whose exporters intend to pay Chinese Customs duty or have already applied for an assessment of duty in Hong Kong. For the sole purpose of verifying the shipment of goods on which Chinese Customs duty has been paid or assessed in Hong Kong, the Customs may freely station inspectors in the above-mentioned typhoon shelters and mooring areas. The number of these inspectors shall not exceed forty, unless the written permission of the Governor of Hong Kong is obtained, plus an appropriate number of servants, the number of which shall be agreed upon by the Governor of Hong Kong. In addition, in order to verify the loading of goods on which Chinese Customs duty has been paid or assessed in Hong Kong onto vessels of 200 tons net registered tonnage or more, the Customs may separately station an appropriate number of inspectors and servants, the number of which shall be agreed upon by the Governor of Hong Kong. Inspectors and servants may freely board any vessel for the above-mentioned purpose, but their duties shall be limited to verification and shall not interfere with or obstruct the loading of goods. Detailed inspection shall be carried out at the Customs inspection facility at the time of assessment. All Customs personnel performing inspection of goods must have an identification card with a photograph attached and certified by the local Customs Commissioner or his representative. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as authorizing any Customs officer or employee to enter any private place without the consent of the owner.</p>
<p>The Government shall instruct the Harbour Master to use his best endeavors to assist the Customs in refusing clearance to vessels sailing from Hong Kong to any port in China, except ports listed in the port schedule agreed upon by the Customs and the Harbour Master locally. This instruction is discretionary in nature and may be changed or revoked at any time in normal or specific circumstances. If it is sufficiently proven that a vessel that has cleared customs in Hong Kong and is sailing to a certain port in China has not sailed to that port without sufficient cause, then upon the vessel's return to Hong Kong, it shall be subject to penalties in accordance with normal procedures. Vessels with a registered net tonnage of less than 200 tons sailing from Hong Kong to Chinese ports shall, unless otherwise specified by the Customs, be notified to stop at one of the Customs stations near Hong Kong. Legislation necessary to implement this provision shall be introduced by the Government to the Hong Kong Legislative Council in due course.</p>
<p>The Government hereby authorizes the Customs to freely enter and patrol the areas within the territorial waters of Hong Kong described in the schedule attached to this Agreement [hereinafter referred to as "prohibited areas"], and to order any vessel in these areas to stop in order to examine its documents. If any vessel is found to be carrying goods without having completed customs clearance procedures in a Hong Kong port, the Customs shall hand the vessel over to the nearest convenient Hong Kong authority for custody, except for vessels that are permitted to continue their voyage. The Government shall introduce to the Hong Kong Legislative Council the legislation necessary to implement this provision, including measures to prohibit any cargo vessel that has not completed customs clearance procedures in a Hong Kong port from entering a prohibited area, but this provision shall not be construed as imposing any obligation on the Government to grant the Customs any right to search, seize, detain or penalize, or any right that the Government cannot cede or the Customs cannot enforce under international law.</p>
<p>The Government shall consider the needs of Hong Kong and the services of vessels in cargo transportation at the same time. Ships with a fourth class license owned according to the 1899 Merchant Shipping Law will, from time to time, be considered for prohibition of using them for the purpose of cargo shipment.</p>
<p>The Government shall consider what measures are feasible to prescribe that goods transported from Hong Kong to China via the northern border be limited to export through Shatoujiao, a location opposite Yuntang, the location where the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway crosses the border, the Luohu Railway Bridge, and other locations agreed upon by both parties, and to prevent or deter the export of goods at other locations on that border.</p>
<p>No provision of any clause shall apply to goods intended to be transported to China by air. No Customs officials shall be stationed at Kai Tak Airport, and the Customs officials currently stationed there shall be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The Customs and the Hong Kong Controller of Imports and Exports shall each provide to the other any information that it may acquire and that, in its opinion, would be helpful to the other in preventing and detecting smuggling of narcotics and taxable goods, or the export or import [as the case may be] of prohibited exports or imports.</p>
<p>The Customs' management of cargo transportation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway shall continue to be governed by the precedent and stipulated in an agreement separately made between the Government and the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of China. However, under the provisions of any such agreement, the payment of Customs duty in Hong Kong shall remain at the option of the merchants concerned. However, the Government may still provide lawful assistance to the Customs in accordance with any ordinances, regulations, or other laws currently in effect in Hong Kong relating to the railway or in a manner agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<p>During the term of this Agreement, the person stationed in Hong Kong at any time as the Chinese Customs Commissioner [as well as the Commissioners in charge of various departments in Hong Kong] shall be British and shall be a person acceptable to the Government.</p>
<p>As used in this Agreement, the term "vessel" shall include merchant ships, barges, and any type of vessel that may be used for the transportation of goods.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall enter into force on the date to be determined and notified by the Governor of Hong Kong, but this date shall be no later than January 20, 1948. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of one year from the date of its entry into force.

<h3>Agency for Implementing European Recovery Program Should be Under Control of the State Department, Marshall Firmly States in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York Radio, 12th: Washington Dispatch, Secretary of State Marshall testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, expressing the same views as when he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is, he has no preconceived notions about the agency for implementing the European Recovery Program, but he firmly maintains that a separate agency should be established, directly under the control of the State Department. Marshall believes that the European Recovery Program is "closely related" to American foreign policy and is the most important expression of American foreign relations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] When Secretary of State Marshall presents his views on the European Recovery Program to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 12th, he is expected to be questioned about aid to China. Marshall's remarks may be more forceful than those he made before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to people familiar with the State Department, as the Congressional review of the European Recovery Program enters its second week, Marshall is increasingly optimistic that Congress will approve a plan with appropriate amounts and conditions. Marshall's current task is to prevent the Republicans from delaying the implementation of the aid program by involving other issues. The House Foreign Affairs Committee's questioning about aid to China and the economic situation in Latin America are part of these Republican tactics. In addition, the issue of dismantling German factories for war reparations is also expected to be raised by the House Foreign Affairs Committee to Marshall. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will listen to the views of the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas, on the European Recovery Program today.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 11th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee concluded its three-day discussion of the European Recovery Program yesterday, while the House Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to begin reviewing the same issue on Monday. In view of the remarks made by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and political leaders from both parties, as well as the close attention paid by the members to the testimonies of Marshall and Ambassador Douglas to the United Kingdom, it can be seen that the review of the European Recovery Program will be extremely thorough and will continue for several weeks.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Management of the European Aid "Money Bag," the United States Seeks a Compromise Solution, the State Department Management Theory Has Been Strongly Opposed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to reports on the 11th, senior American administrative officials are currently "diligently and hopefully" seeking a way to satisfy both Congress and the State Department regarding the management of the Marshall European Recovery Program. The current dispute concerns whether Congress or the State Department should manage the "money bag," and whether to establish a corporation controlled by Congress or an administrator who obeys the State Department's orders to implement this massive program.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall's efforts to urge acceptance of the State Department's plan have encountered serious opposition, and a compromise solution is now being sought, with the aim of breaking down this obstacle. So far, a satisfactory solution has not been obtained, but a highly placed administrative official informed United Press. Members of Congress are currently looking for solutions and are hopeful of finding a satisfactory answer, but continued: "This will be a long and arduous struggle." At the same time, Representative Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, has declared war on the Marshall Plan. Taber said: "The cost is too high." In a stirring statement, he called Truman's foreign aid spending plan a "blow" to the United States and the world. He strongly stated that Secretary of State Marshall desperately wanted Congress to rubber-stamp the plan, and that he found Marshall guilty of making surprising suggestions and unworthy of serving as Secretary of State.</p>
<h3>Aid to China, Japan, and Korea Should First be Presented to Congress, Republican Senator Folis' Opinion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Republican Senator Folis told reporters that before discussing the Marshall Plan, bills for aid to China, South America, Germany, Japan, and Korea should first be presented to Congress. We should not hastily vote on a plan and then discover that we have no remaining resources to aid other countries. At the same time, according to State Department sources, the original plan in the Marshall Plan for the first year of aid to Britain, France, West Germany, and Greece has been reduced by two billion dollars. The amount of aid to Italy, Denmark, and Sweden has also been slightly reduced, while aid to the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Norway has been slightly increased. Thus, the total expenditure required for the first fifteen months of the Marshall Plan is $6.8 billion.</p>
<h3>Truman's New Budget Attacked by Republicans, Who Believe US Financial Resources Cannot Handle It</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York Radio, 12th: Washington Dispatch, Republican members of Congress have launched criticisms against President Truman's proposed budget, deeming it "excessively wasteful" and "not within the financial capabilities of the nation this year." Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is leading this attack. He believes that although the President suggested last week that the burden on each taxpayer be reduced by $40, this is in fact impossible according to the budget proposal. While the President's proposed national defense expenditures and foreign aid expenditures cannot be said to be entirely inappropriate, they still meet actual needs, but he will also review them carefully, he said.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman will submit the 1949 fiscal budget to the Republican-controlled Congress on the 12th, which is expected to quickly become a major point of contention in the 1948 election campaign. This budget book is a document that is two inches thick, including a 57-page presidential message and 1,375 pages of explanations and figures.</p>
<h3>French Representatives Go to England to Discuss the Sixteen-Nation Conference; Plan to Establish a Permanent Organization</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Britain and France will begin discussions on the 13th regarding reconvening the Paris Economic Conference of the sixteen European nations under the Marshall Plan. Alphant, economic advisor to the French Foreign Ministry, and Marmelin, assistant to French chief economic planner Monnet, are expected to arrive from Paris today to participate in the consultations.</p>
<p>The subject of the consultations is the reopening of the sixteen-nation conference and its scope, as well as the establishment of a permanent information and consultation organization. All sixteen nations have requested the establishment of such an organization since the beginning of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Prices Rise; Higher Prices Expected This Year</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 12th] U.S. prices in 1947 have already been labeled as too high, but many predict that they will be even higher in 1948. A consumer's dollar can only buy half the goods it could in 1935-39, but they have more dollars and spent heavily at the end of 1947, which is able to sustain current prices. Prices have been rising almost continuously for a year, reaching the peak after the First World War in 1920.</p>
<h3>British Trade Deficit; Exports Surge Last Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Commerce Minister Wilson stated at a meeting here last night that preliminary statistics for December's British exports show the highest daily export value of any month since the war, the highest record in 25 years. December's export volume was about 20% higher than in 1938, and the export target for mid-1948 is 40% of 1938, only 20% away. However, the value of imports also increased greatly in December, so the trade deficit still reached £39 million.</p>
<h3>French Inflation Reaches Chronic Stage</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] Minister of Labor Berfferyrin stated on the 12th that inflation has reached a chronic stage, and if it is not corrected, it will make France __________, the results of which are difficult to predict. He asked farmers to support the government's newly enacted tax policy on the wealthy, which stipulates a super tax on those with incomes above a certain level. He assured farmers that loans would be used to genuinely _________ agriculture.</p>
<h3>Italian Tax Collectors Strike in Support of Bank Employees</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 11th] The General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communists, has ordered 160,000 tax collectors to strike starting on the 12th in support of 60,000 bank employees who are on strike.</p>
<h3>Senate Committees Consider Suspending Funding for U.S. Occupation of Japan; Believe Government Has Not Provided Sufficient Information on Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Senator Knowland, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told the Associated Press: From my personal point of view, unless the Army and State Departments provide sufficient information about the policy of dispersing Japanese industry, there will be no funds available for the Japanese occupation administration in the next fiscal year. Knowland believes that the authorities should fully disclose the entire policy of dissolving the concentration of the Japanese economy and provide a full explanation of the reparations policy. Only then can the two committees review the Japanese occupation funds requested by the two departments to be used starting on July 1. Knowland acknowledged that the State Department has provided some information, but there are two major issues that the two departments have not provided: one is a copy of the four bills recently passed by the Japanese Diet implementing the economic decentralization policy; the other is conclusive proof that our country has no obligations to other countries regarding the reparations issue.</p>
<h3>United Nations Commission on Korea Holds First Meeting Yesterday; Representatives from Ukraine and One Other Country Absent</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 12th] The United Nations Commission on Korea held its first meeting here at 5 p.m. today, at Deoksugung Palace, formerly the site of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission. Kim Kyu-sik and many international guests attended the meeting. Representatives from Ukraine and one other country were absent. The meeting was opened by interim Chairman Hu Shih-tse, who stated the reason for the meeting: "We have come for the independence of Korea. Today, representatives from various countries and fields are here to consult with the Korean people. I am very pleased." Then, Indian representative Menon was elected as chairman of the meeting. Previously, the Philippine representative argued that a chairman should not be elected until an order is received from the United Nations General Assembly allowing work to proceed unilaterally without Ukraine, but this was rejected. Representatives from China, France, Syria, and the Philippines then gave speeches.</p>
<p>My Representative's Speech</p>
<p>The gist of the Chinese representative's speech was: "After eight years of war and two years of peace, Korea has not yet achieved independence, which is a very unfortunate event. The current situation in China is quite unstable, especially in the Northeast. The instability in the Northeast also affects Korea. Korea was once an independent country, but after the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War, it became a colony of Japanese imperialism. Now, it is an opportunity for Korea to gain independence and freedom. China, as a neighbor, should be concerned about the independence and integrity of Korea. We sincerely hope that Korea can seek cooperation with all countries in the world and work together for world peace."</p>

<h3>Bridge Over Jordan River Destroyed; Passage Between Syria and Palestine Cut Off; Arab Guerrilla Forces Intensifying Training</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jerusalem, 11th, United Press] Saboteurs tonight destroyed the "Daughters of Jacob" bridge over the Jordan River, cutting off the military passage between Palestine and Syria. When the explosion occurred, the Arab and Jewish forces on both banks of the Jordan River also engaged in a fierce battle. The British statement regarding the destruction of the bridge did not specify whether it was carried out by Jewish or Arab saboteurs. It is believed that the Jewish underground army is now attempting to cut off all possible routes for Arab troops coming from the Syrian-Lebanese border. Therefore, it is believed that the bridge was destroyed by the Jewish underground army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Palestinian Arab Guerrilla Headquarters in the Mountains, 11th] An Arab leader told a reporter from this agency that the Palestinian Arab guerrillas have been receiving large-scale training at mountain bases near Samaria and Galilee. Within a month, they can be deployed as a disciplined military force. Countless Arab youths have left their homes to join the guerrillas. Many of the trainers are commissioned officers who have served in the British army. At the same time, it is rumored that thousands of Arab troops led by Kaukji, the hero in the hearts of the Arabs, are also preparing to invade Palestine from the Syrian border. This move will be a signal for a large-scale war to seize the ownership of Palestine. A reporter traveled 450 kilometers in the mountains of the Galilee region. In the so-called "Terror Triangle" of Nablus, Tulkarm, and Jenin, he saw countless Arabs carrying various long and short firearms and knives. They all said that they were waiting for the order to fight and were confident that they would surround and annihilate the Jewish army. Abdul Husseini, commander of the Arab forces in the Jerusalem area, came to Jenin to meet with guerrilla leaders. The center of Jenin was full of Arabs with bullets hanging all over their bodies. On the roads, Arabs carrying guns drove back and forth in jeeps. Obstacles were set up at all major intersections to strictly inspect passing vehicles. The Arabs seem to have plenty of weapons and ammunition.</p>
<h3>Former Romanian King Carol Concerned About Domestic Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lisbon, 11th] Former Romanian King Carol said here today, "I believe that recent events in Romania have extremely serious implications for my country and the international situation. The replacement of the monarchy by the so-called Democratic People's Republic, which is actually a Soviet Republic, is a further step in the Communist movement in Europe and a serious threat to the civilized world. I am deeply saddened by my son's abdication. Judging from all indications, the act of abdication and its conditions were the result of coercion. In the darkest period of recent Romanian history, I was deeply worried about my son's fate. Now that I know my son is at least safe, I am very relieved. The incorporation of Romania into the Soviet system goes against the spirit of the Romanian people. Their future and freedom will henceforth depend on the victory of the civilized world."</p>

<h3>Katayama Cabinet Considering Dissolving Japanese Diet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Kyodo News Agency said today that the Japanese Central Purge Committee will lift the purge order against former Agriculture Minister Hirano, "which has almost become a certainty." This makes the Katayama Cabinet feel uneasy about the motivation of the political situation, and the possibility of considering dissolving the Diet is increasing. It is reported that conservative elements will begin concrete work to form a new party this week. More defections of government party members are still not enough to put the opposition party in the position of the majority party. The proposed new conservative party will reduce the seats of the Socialist Party in the Diet. As a result, the government will face extreme difficulties in the Diet. Therefore, Tetsu Katayama advocates dissolving the Diet, hoping to make a desperate gamble in another general election.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] As a result of the recent development of the Hirano purge issue, the Socialist Party has now begun to attack Suehiro Nishio. It is expected that Nishio's power may be overthrown at this party congress, creating the Katayama-Asanuma line. If Prime Minister Katayama still does not know how to adapt to the situation and is unwilling to abandon the Katayama-Nishio line, then it is feared that a cabinet reshuffle will occur, realizing the opportunity for a Shioda prime minister.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Liberal Party believes that the time for organizing a new conservative party has matured. In order to actively materialize it, a meeting of cadres was held on the 12th, and eleven members of the preparatory committee for the establishment of the new party were appointed. These committee members, together with some members of the Shidehara faction's club, which had defected from the Democratic Party, reported at that time the purpose of actively materializing the new party movement and requested assistance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Seismologist Predicts Major Earthquake in Japan</h3>

Residents in the Kyoto and Osaka areas should prepare quickly. Previously, another seismologist, Dr. Shuichi Yamaguchi, had predicted that there would be a major earthquake in the Tokyo area, but he has now retracted this prediction.</p>

<h3>United Nations Balkan Committee Publishes Investigative Report; Accuses Albania of Interfering in Greek Affairs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 11th] The United Nations Balkan Committee's December report was released today. It accuses Albania of interfering in Greek affairs and actively participating in the Greek guerrilla team activities. It also stated, "The committee is deeply concerned about the recent political situation in the areas involved in the United Nations General Assembly's resolutions."</p>
<p>Regarding Bulgaria, the report stated, "Although the peace treaty with Bulgaria has been signed, Greece's attempt to restore diplomatic relations with Bulgaria caused Bulgaria to request that Greece recall its liaison officer stationed in Bulgaria, expel a large number of Greeks from Bulgaria, and Premier Dimitrov of Bulgaria to make a declaration on the day the Bulgarian-Albanian friendship treaty was signed. Regarding Yugoslavia, the report pointed out directly that relations with Yugoslavia continued to deteriorate, as revealed by official documents at the end of 1947. The report finally mentioned the establishment of the "Provisional Democratic Greek Government" led by Greek guerrilla commander Markos on December 24, 1947, calling it the most shocking political development in recent times. It also stated that the United Nations Balkan Committee is closely monitoring the consequences caused by the cooperation between Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania and the Provisional Government. In addition, it is also paying close attention to any events that may lead to a special session of the General Assembly being convened on the recommendation of the United Nations Committee.</p>
<h3>Greece Asks U.S. to Unfreeze Gold to Curb Black Market and Stabilize Currency Value</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 12th] It was revealed today that the Greek government has asked the U.S. aid to Greece mission to request the British government to unfreeze 1.3 million gold coins (equivalent to £2.5 million in British gold) that Greece previously pledged as collateral when it borrowed 10 million U.S. dollars from the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, so that the Greek bank can sell gold, curb the rise in the black market price of gold coins, and stabilize the value of the Greek drachma.</p>
<h3>American Engineers Brave the Heat to Work on Middle East Pipeline Project; Traversing Over a Thousand Miles of the Great Desert</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 12th] A group of American engineers and others are now working hard in the rugged Middle Eastern wilderness where the temperature is as high as 130 degrees Fahrenheit, completing the survey work for the Arabian Oil Company's 1,040-mile pipeline. They are the pioneers who began to move the world's oil economy, because the world's use and need for oil is greater than before. For example, in the United States, the estimated production and consumption rate in 1947 exceeded 2 billion barrels, which is 800 million barrels more than the consumption in 1938 and exceeds the world's total consumption in that year. It is predicted that the consumption in the United States will reach 2.2 billion barrels by 1952. The oil cream stored in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, destined for the Lebanese coast, is scheduled to transport 300,000 barrels of oil per day for use in Europe. In addition, an agreement has been reached to move oil tankers on the U.S.-Europe route to the Europe-Middle East route. Oil production and exports to the U.S. from the Caribbean have ceased, and it is expected that from 1950 onwards, the Arabian pipeline will replace the Western Hemisphere's oil supply to Europe.</p>
<h3>German Division Difficult to Avoid; Soviets Plan to Force Britain and the U.S. to Withdraw from Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] The starving and freezing German people are again deeply disturbed by the fact that Germany is facing the fate of unity or division. At this critical juncture, any action that could be regarded as provocative by one side is enough to cause the division of Germany and the withdrawal of representatives from the Allied Control Council. If so, then West Germany and East Germany will be formed. Most people in Berlin believe that division is inevitable. The Soviet Union has issued a warning in the Soviet newspapers in Berlin, stating that any action deemed by the Soviet Union to be in violation of the Four-Power Agreement will cause immediate consequences. These actions include the annexation of the British and American combined zones of the army district. At present, the further development of West German economic institutions into political institutions, or Britain's endorsement of the United States to stop allocating West German reparations to the Soviet Union, etc., if the Western powers decide to accomplish any one of the aforementioned actions, then the Soviet Union will immediately take countermeasures and announce its withdrawal from the Allied Control Council. If the division of Germany becomes a reality, the first to feel the consequences will be Berlin. Geographically, Berlin is in the heart of the Soviet zone. If the Soviet Union cuts off the supply of roads, railways, electricity, and water, it can make it impossible for the unwelcome British, American, and French to live in Berlin.</p>

<h3>U.S. Relief Rice Distribution Plan; Every Citizen Gets Five Sheng Per Month Per Catty; Registered Households Are Eligible for Rationing; Municipal Committee Decides to Complete Preparations Within the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The second meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies was held at 4 p.m. yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Wu Guozhen, Yen Hui-ching, Huo Baoshu, Shen Zonglian, Ye Shifu, Xi Yushu, Gu Minqiong, Zeng Shaochu, Chen Guangyuan, Liu Zongyue, Ren Xianqun, and Anferlai, representatives of the United China Relief, attended. The grain occupies 125,000 tons, the first ship has arrived in Shanghai, and the second ship is about to arrive. It was decided to distribute it to the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. Among them, Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin have distribution scales, but Guangzhou is in preparation. The Sino-American Relief Agreement stipulates that American relief supplies are rationed to people other than the classified citizens who have been rationed. The so-called classified citizens refer to public and religious personnel, industrial workers, professional workers, etc. In Shanghai, all registered households are eligible for rationing. As a result of the discussion at the Administrative Yuan of Nanjing Committee for the Handling of American Relief Supplies, a four-month rationing plan was set, with each person receiving five sheng of rice per month, totaling two dou in four months. The purpose is to average the supply, hoping to stabilize the food industry. The distribution price is not intended to be too different from the market price, and may be adjusted once a month. The significance of the Sino-American Agreement lies in assisting China to establish a comprehensive rationing system. If assistance is successful, our government can control food and solve the food problem. The results of the discussion by the Yuan Committee are being exchanged with the American representatives.</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian Urges Preparation and Printing of Rice Purchase Certificates</p>
<p>Then Wu Kaixian said: In addition to the current rationed citizens in this city, there are 40 million people waiting to be rationed. Therefore, a special agency has been designated to plan first, and the printing of rice purchase certificates must also be started. Afterwards, Mayor Wu said: All those who register their households have the right to be rationed. He hopes that rice rationing can be averaged and carried out for a long time. Later, Miao Jiaming, Yen Hui-ching, and the American representatives fully exchanged opinions and decided to handle it according to the methods of the Sino-American Relief Agreement. According to the methods set by the Yuan Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies will decide on specific implementation methods, and it was decided to complete the preparations within this month. The date of commencement of rationing can only be determined after the supplies arrive in Shanghai.</p>

The market was weak, and Shangbai Rice hovered around 1.4 million yuan, not exceeding the price limit.

<h3>China Trust Bureau Welcomes Investigation of Allegation of Selling Japanese Cloth</h3>
<p>[Our Report] 2,500 civil servants in Nanjing jointly submitted a document to the Control Yuan to impeach the China Trust Bureau for "withholding Japanese cloth intended for rationing and using it for export to Australia." A reporter recently spoke to the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau to inquire about the matter. According to him, the China Trust Bureau is not a rationing agency and has never had such contacts. The basis for the current impeachment is unknown. This type of Japanese cloth came from barter trade with Japan. It was originally intended to be sold in Shanghai, but it was not implemented due to the opposition of the national factory. The use has not yet been decided, and the claim of exporting it to Australia is also a rumor. The Control Yuan is welcome to send personnel to Shanghai to investigate, and it is hoped that the Executive Yuan can provide instructions on how to dispose of this batch of Japanese cloth.</p>

<h3>A Self-Proclaimed Retired Major Leads Wounded Soldiers in Rampage; Seven Shops and Houses on Pingliang Road Forcibly Demolished; Fan Zhongguang Detained and Sent to Garrison Headquarters for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning, at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Fenzhou Road in Yangshupu, a large group of veterans suddenly appeared, led by Fan Zhongguang, a retired soldier who claimed to be a major. They forcibly demolished seven shops and houses along the road, from 500 to 508 Pingliang Road and 92 to 102 Fenzhou Road. Upon receiving the news, the Yulin Police Precinct rushed to the scene and immediately arrested Fan. The 20th Wounded Soldiers Hospital on Meizhou Road demanded severe punishment for Fan for using ignorant wounded soldiers to bully civilians. The Yulin Precinct sent Fan to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>The corner of Pingliang Road and Fenzhou Road is the property of Sassoon &amp; Co. During the War of Resistance, the property was poorly managed, and local poor people built shacks to live there in 1943. After the victory, the shack dwellers along the road rebuilt their shacks into tile-roofed houses in accordance with the police bureau's notice to improve the city's appearance. Later, a man named Liu Jizhang, residing at 390 Yangshupu Road, leased the land from Sassoon and ordered the shack dwellers to move, but the shack dwellers ignored him. The matter was litigated and, after six court hearings, the court advised mediation, which failed. Last summer, the court ruled for demolition but did not set a specific deadline. The shack dwellers appealed to the High Court within the statutory period, and the case has not yet been concluded.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire Suspected of Arson</p>

Fortunately, nearby residents and firefighters arrived and worked hard to extinguish the fire. Four houses were burned, so arson is suspected.</p>

<p>On the 5th, Fan came again to urge them to move. On the morning of the 9th, Fan led a large number of wounded soldiers to force the residents along the road to move their furniture and belongings to the open space across the road. By about 4:00 p.m., Fan, seeing that his plan had succeeded, happily left. After Fan and the others left, the shack dwellers moved their furniture back in and lived as before. That evening, Fan came again and, the next morning (the 10th), brought a large number of wounded soldiers, carrying ropes, hammers, axes, and other tools, forcibly demolished all seven houses, leaving more than 400 residents homeless. Yesterday, they sent representatives to appeal to all sectors for justice, demand punishment for the perpetrators, and compensation, and plan to go to the municipal government to petition today.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ship Sinks in the Deep Sea After Hitting a Reef; Crew Rescued and Returned to Vladivostok</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to U.S. Navy sources, the Soviet ship "Podotsk," which ran aground on a reef 48 nautical miles outside Wusong Port on the 9th of this month, sank into the sea late the day before yesterday. The crew and sailors were all rescued and out of danger. The ship was sailing from Shanghai to Vladivostok and had no passengers or cargo on board. After the accident, the U.S. Navy signal station here intercepted a distress signal and notified the Soviet Consulate to send another Soviet ship, "Smolny," and barges to provide assistance, but they were unable to tow the ship out of danger. The crack in the No. 2 hold of the ship gradually widened, and eventually the ship was filled with water and quickly tilted off the reef and sank. The crew and sailors have now been taken to Vladivostok by the "Smolny."</p>
<h3>A Grand Gathering at Lake Society; All Sectors Welcome Archbishop Yu Bin</h3>
<p>Yu Bin, Archbishop of the Nanjing District of the Catholic Church, went to the United States last October for observation and had extensive contact with American officials and people from all walks of life. He also met with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall in his private capacity to exchange views on Sino-U.S. issues. Yu returned to the country at the end of last month and arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. At 3:00 p.m., he attended a grand welcome tea party held by all sectors of the city at Lake Society. The welcome party was presided over by Speaker Pan, and people from all sectors attended. After Speaker Pan delivered a welcome speech, Archbishop Yu rose to speak amidst warm applause, detailing his observations during his two-month trip to the United States and the evolution of American officials' and all sectors' understanding of China. He concluded by saying that the American people have generally recognized that China's bandits are actually a part of the international communist camp, and that China's civil war is not only a matter for China but could very well be the cause of a third world war. Chairman Fang delivered a reply. The tea party ended at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Scheduled to Hold General Mobilization Rally for Suppressing Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal General Mobilization Committee for Suppressing Rebellion and National Reconstruction held its first meeting at the Municipal Council at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Xu Ji, Du Yuesheng (represented by Zhu Wende), and Shui Xiangyun. Chairman Pan presided over the meeting.

<h3>Refugees Bring Kala-azar; Nine Patients Isolated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Health Bureau, the mobile medical prevention team sent to treat refugees in various districts has discovered nine cases of kala-azar. They have been sent to Zhongshan, Hongren, Red Cross hospitals, and the Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital for free hospitalization and isolation treatment. The International Relief Committee has also sent 100 ampoules of the latest therapeutic agent "Pentamidine," donated by the British Red Cross. On the one hand, black flies are being tested and efforts are being made to eliminate them. Kala-azar is transmitted by black flies and has a very high mortality rate. It is prevalent in Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, with more than 500,000 patients.</p>
<h3>Train Fails to Stop at Station, Falsely Reports Bandit Hijacking</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The incident of the 56th train on the Beijing-Shanghai line failing to stop at Changshu at 1:30 a.m. the day before yesterday was rumored to be due to the driver being forced to hijack the train at gunpoint by two bandits. Yesterday, the railway bureau's spokesperson specifically corrected the statement, saying that according to the investigation results, when the train approached Changzhou, the Fangpeng of the Qishuyan Power Plant was damaged, and the Changzhou station was in complete darkness. The driver may have been negligent and failed to notice, so he fabricated the story to evade responsibility. Because no accident occurred on the train, why would the "bandits" insist on passing Changzhou station before getting off? The train driver, Song Shunlong, and the conductor, Shan Wenhan, have been detained by the police department, and the railway bureau has sent personnel to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Paper Storage Limited to Three Months' Worth; Price Evaluation Committee to Negotiate Prices at Any Time; Covert Purchases Considered Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to Item Ding of Article 2 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times, paper is also included in the items that should be cracked down on. The Municipal Government's Second Economic Conference had previously discussed this. Yesterday morning, the Second Social Police Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Qian Xingzhong, and representatives from the Paper Industry Association, Zhan Peilin, to discuss issues such as the amount of paper storage and the price negotiation system. It was agreed that the types of paper to be cracked down on for hoarding are newsprint and Mao paper (divided into domestic and machine-made). The storage standard for each store is one-fourth of the total sales volume for the entire year of 1947, which is equivalent to three months of sales volume. Those who exceed this amount will be considered hoarders. The import of newsprint with self-provided foreign exchange should be handled separately. Paper merchants should report to the Social Bureau and their respective associations and should sell it in the market. The paper industry association should organize a price evaluation committee to evaluate the selling price of paper at any time and report it to the Social Bureau for filing. Anyone who exceeds the negotiated price will be punished according to law. The above measures will be implemented after Director Wu approves them and submits them to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau also stated that if there are agents who introduce and have no real owners, or who purchase and store in secret names, they will be considered hoarders once discovered. The regulations for the amount of paper stored by non-paper merchants and non-merchants will be discussed and determined by the Price Management Section of the Social Bureau together with relevant parties. In addition, whether the amount of paper stored by newspapers, magazines, and printing houses needs to be restricted or ordered to register has been submitted to the Municipal Government for instructions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beijing Air Transport Drug Trafficking Case Solved After Tortuous Investigation; Ten Principals to Be Executed According to Law</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department recently cracked a major drug trafficking case involving air transport in Shanghai, seizing more than 90 catties of morphine. A total of 25 men and women, including principals and suspects, were arrested. It is reported that the ten principals will all be executed. The cracking of this case was complex. The Central News Agency reporter obtained the details from the responsible parties as follows: In November of last year, the Garrison Commander received a confidential report regarding drug trafficking, which briefly stated that someone was transporting drugs from the communist area in the north to Tianjin and Beijing, then transporting them to Shanghai and selling them to various ports. He immediately ordered the Investigation Department to investigate and solve the case. The Investigation Department sent personnel to Longhua Airport every day to pay special attention to the investigation of passengers. Secondly, when checking the passenger list, they found a Colonel-rank active-duty military officer named Li Jianfei, who took the airline plane between Beijing and Shanghai every one or two weeks, which aroused suspicion. Later, it was found that Li often stayed at the Nanjing Hotel in Shanghai and associated with many friends from Henan. It was discovered that some of his friends were drug dealers from Henan. The investigators used "cells" to try to get close to Li and learned that Li often carried a pistol in the sleeve of his right hand. At the same time, they learned that he was indeed responsible for transportation for the drug trafficking organization between Beijing and Shanghai. On December 9, they learned that his drug trafficking method was to transport the drugs in a specially made vest on his body. They waited at the airport on the afternoon of the 11th, and Li arrived from Beijing by plane and opened room 419 of the Andong Hostel on Beihubei Road.</p>
<p>Drug Traffickers Captured in Hostel</p>
<p>Personnel from the Seventh Investigation Brigade rushed to the hostel and saw that the room contained Hai Ziling (also known as Mai Changde), the person in charge of the Shanghai drug trafficking organization, as well as Mai Renfa, Dan Ze, Jia Jinbao, Kong Fanzhen, and others. They were arrested, and three small packets of morphine samples were found on Hai Ziyun's body. They then learned that Li had opened another room, No. 310, at the Yangzi Hotel, so they left some officers to guard the Andong Hostel and rushed to Yangzi. Li was not there again. Searching the room, they found a cloth vest used to transport and hide morphine behind the wardrobe, a Mauser pistol No. 2670 with live ammunition, and more than 40 bullets. The morphine, including the wrapping, was weighed on the spot, weighing 5 catties and 8 taels, and sealed.</p>
<p>Fake Colonel Enters the Cage</p>
<p>At about 10:00 p.m. that night, Wang Dechang, an investigator guarding the Andong Hostel, suddenly heard the phone ring and asked for Jia Changde to answer. Wang answered using a Henan accent. The other party believed it and said that his name was Li Jianfei and said that he was borrowing a phone elsewhere. Wang Dechang told him, "Boss Jia is eating, come if you want." Li Jianfei then entered the cage. After arriving at Andong, he was immediately arrested. Forged documents from the Second Hall of the Ministry of National Defense, with the rank of colonel, were found on his body, as many as ten.</p>
<p>Based on the obtained clues, drug dealers Bu Longfu (also known as Bu Xisan) were arrested at the Wu Palace Hotel, and Chen Jixi and two other drug dealers were arrested at No. 39 Xinmin Hotel. All eight principals in Shanghai were captured, and fifteen suspects were arrested in other places.</p>
<p>Confesses to the Inside Story of the Organization</p>
<p>In the interrogation room of the Seventh Brigade, Li Jianfei had no way to deny it and wrote a voluntary statement, confessing that he had bought morphine in Beijing for Hai Ziyun. After interrogating Hai Ziyun, he confessed the details of the Henan gang's drug trafficking organization in Shanghai: The organization was located at No. 14 Zhonghua Market, Zhonghua Road, Laoximen. The list of people in charge was: Manager Hai Ziyun, Deputy Manager Kong Fanzhen, Jia Jinbao. Economic Backer Chen Jixi, Drug Modification Engineer Dan Qing, Bu Longfu. Li Jianfei and Jia Renfa were the transporters between Shanghai and Beijing.</p>
<p>Hai Ziyun often opened a room at the Dafang Hotel in Shanghai, and resided at No. 33, 5th Alley, Jiaochang in Beijing. He also set up a Hongtai Gold Store at No. 21 Guanyin Temple in Beijing and had been trafficking drugs for eight years. He confessed that the names of the three major drug traffickers in Beijing who were connected to him were: Ma Xueyi (also known as Ma Erye), Jia Lizhi, and Li Benchu. The drugs were transported from the communist area by Ma Xueyi and others to Shanghai, then transported to Henan and other places. The amount was very large.</p>
<p>Drugs Found in Nanshi</p>
<p>In addition to air transport, the drugs were sometimes transported by train from Beijing to Tianjin, then transported from Tianjin to Shanghai by boat, with the drugs secretly packed in paint barrels. Two large boxes of morphine are currently hidden at No. 14 Zhonghua Market, Zhonghua Road, Laoximen, Nanshi.</p>
<p>According to the confession, the interrogators sent Shi Jian and others to Nanshi to retrieve the morphine. One was a wicker package and the other was a wooden box, containing both manufactured morphine and raw materials, weighing more than 80 catties in total, which were sealed by the personnel handling the case.</p>
<p>The Shanghai case was reported to Commander Xuan, who was extremely angry and handwritten an order to continue to pursue the relevant drug dealers in Beijing. Director Tao and Road Inspector Chen studied the matter and sent Shi Jian, attached to the Seventh Brigade, and Yan Jinwen, leader of the action team, to Beijing by plane on December 21 to work with the personnel of the Beijing Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department to start the work of solving the Beijing case.</p>
<p>Two Principals in Beijing Caught</p>
<p>Ma Xueyi, a drug trafficking tycoon in Beijing, heard that his Shanghai partners had "fallen," so he moved from No. 25 Lianzi Alley, Hepingmen, to the home of his mistress, Liu Fengming (a Beijing opera performer), at No. 13 Hongjing, Qianmen. According to a tip, Shi Yan and others captured Ma there on the 22nd. Jia Lizhi, another drug dealer, was arrested at No. 44 Xiangluying Toutiao. Li Benchu was unable to be located due to having no fixed residence. Shi Yan and others also seized incense at No. 27 Donghuamen Street for Li Jian. The case also involves a certain Jia, a Beijing Municipal Councilor. It is understood that Jia has great influence in Beijing and is currently being investigated by the Beijing Investigation Department.</p>
<p>After the Beijing case was completed, Shi Yan and others escorted the two arrested criminals back to Shanghai by plane on New Year's Day this year. The entire case of people and stolen goods was sent to the Investigation Department a few days ago and will be transferred to the military court for handling.</p>
<h3>Jinyuan Cloth Shop Punished with Business Suspension</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Jinyuan Cloth Shop, located at No. 3, Lane 12, Nanwuxi Road, in this city, was found to have deposit records based on its collection accounts, which clearly indicated that it was illegally engaged in banking business. The Ministry of Finance recently sent a message to the Municipal Government, ordering the shop to suspend business in accordance with Article 15 of the Banking Law. The person in charge was also fined 5,000 yuan, which, calculated at a thousand times according to the latest regulations of the National Government, amounts to a fine of 5 million yuan. The Municipal Government has instructed the Social Bureau to implement the order.</p>
<h3>Marriage by Deception Fails to Fulfill Dreams; Li Baolin Accused by Two Women After a Moment of Weakness</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Yinmei, a young woman, fell in love with Li Baolin because they were colleagues and married on April 27 of this year. They settled at No. 6, Lane 21, Gaolan Road. Two weeks after the marriage, they went to Taiwan for a honeymoon trip of more than two months. Just as they were about to return to Shanghai, they were notified that their Shanghai residence had been occupied by Li's wife, Zhang Shugui, and her father, Zhang Ziwan. Zhang Yinmei then filed a complaint with the Civil Division of the District Court on August 29 of last year, requesting confirmation of the legality of the marriage between Li Baolin and herself. After receiving the subpoena, Li went to Zhang Yinmei and admitted that he and Zhang Shugui had indeed married in his hometown of Andong at the age of seventeen, but it was not of his own volition. Later, due to a moment of weakness, he committed marriage fraud. Now that his good dreams were difficult to fulfill, he was willing to give her the leasehold of the house on Gaolan Road, the shares of the Huasheng Bra Company, and 100 million yuan in legal tender to compensate for her losses. Zhang then agreed to terminate the contract, and a settlement record was established in the Civil Division of the District Court. Later, Li intended to violate the terms of the settlement, involving the criminal issues of embezzlement and fraud. The complaint provided a description of the incident.</p>

<h3>A Quick Look at Liuzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hengyang, 5th] The major artery of the Southwest—the Xiang-Gui Railway—grew during the War of Resistance and was also destroyed during the War of Resistance. Only two years after victory was it restored with great effort. Thanks to the arduous struggle of the railway's employees, even in the initial stages of rough pioneering, there was a vigorous and enterprising atmosphere. Liuzhou, also known as Maping, is located on</p>
<p>the lower reaches of the Liujiang River</p>
<p>at a strategic point. At this point, the Liujiang River's water volume gradually increases. Small steamers can reach Guiping and Wuzhou downstream, and sailboats can reach Chang'an upstream. In terms of land transportation, there is a road network extending in all directions, and the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway has its central point here. The city is densely packed with shops, commerce is developed, and it has become one of the four major cities in Guangxi Province. The urban area of Liuzhou is divided into two parts, north and south of the Liujiang River. The northern part is the old city area, quiet and lovely, where the Special Commissioner's Office and the County Government and other institutions are located. The southern part is the new city area, with wider roads and vehicles weaving like shuttles, giving it a distinct urban flavor. A pontoon bridge connects the two urban areas, making river crossing easy. Most of the large stores are still in the northern district, but the southern district seems more lively than the northern district, showing signs of overtaking it.</p>
<p>Liuzhou has not yet been designated as a city, but its municipal administration is much more advanced than that of Hengyang, which is designated as a city. We do not say that "law" and "system" are not important, but "people" are ultimately the driving force behind all undertakings. This statement is not an opposition to the establishment of systems, but a request that everyone not forget the human factor after establishing a system. If there is a good system but the right people are not in place, it is better to first emphasize "people" and then pay attention to the system. At the very least, the system and the people should be given equal importance. The Guangxi Provincial Government is planning to turn Liuzhou into</p>
<p>an industrial zone.</p>
<p>Liuzhou does indeed possess the conditions for this. In addition to the extremely convenient railways, highways, and waterways, Liuzhou also has the largest airport in the Southwest, which can accommodate hundreds of planes taking off and landing at the same time.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zongyuan was once demoted to this place, and the seeds of Liuzhou's culture were sown by him at that time. The Luo Chi Temple in the east of the northern city is built by the people of Liuzhou in his memory. It has now been converted into Liuhou Park and contains Liu Gong's burial mound of clothing and hats. The park area is not very large, but the ancient trees reach the sky, and the scenery is quite beautiful. In the bustling urban area, this quiet green oasis provides citizens with a place for recreation, which is an invaluable place for the cultivation of the body and mind and the adjustment of the spirit. Guilin's scenery is the best in the world, but</p>
<p>Liuzhou's scenery</p>
<p>is no less beautiful than Guilin's. The city is surrounded by strange rocky peaks that tower into the clouds. Goose Mountain, where the Xiang-Gui Railway Bureau is located, is one of these strange rocky mountains. Unfortunately, due to the limited time, I was only able to visit Liuhou Park. I was unable to visit the other scenic spots, which I deeply regret.</p>
<p>The prices here are higher than in Guilin but lower than in Hengyang, but imported goods are higher than in Hengyang. The women in the city have a bit of a Hong Kong style. Many of the local poor women are barefoot and wear short clothes. The heavy work of carrying and transporting is done by barefoot women in short clothes. There are fewer men engaged in this kind of hard labor. This place has already entered the South China region, so the climate is warmer, and compared to Hengyang, it is not a difference of one or two months, but a difference of one or two seasons.

<h3>Tiled Boat Sinks; Owner and Others Drown</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin, 11th] The Qin Ji Brick and Tile Sales Office at 176 Maigen Road, Shanghai, hired six sailing boats from the Hubei gang of Mi Shaoxiang and others on December 20th of last year to transport 43,000 pieces of foreign tiles from Jiashan to Beijing. They arrived at Huangtian Port in Cheng County on the 5th of this month, reported for export, and were anchored in Bawu Port, Jingjiang, due to the heavy wind and waves. At 4:00 PM on the 10th, a Shanghai-bound commercial vessel coming downstream collided with the tiled boat, sinking it. The boat owner, Zhu Shaoqing, and the crew member, Wang Zhuanfang, drowned. The fellow boatmen requested the Wanghai Branch Customs to detain the infringing vessel to handle the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Hainan's Two Mines</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hainan Island, 4th] Since its establishment at the beginning of the year, the Hainan Mining Bureau has been actively developing the rich mineral deposits in the two major mining areas of Tiandu and Shilu. The Tiandu and Shilu iron ore mines have been recognized as world-class high-quality mines and have long been famous overseas. After Hainan fell to the enemy, the Japanese invested 300 million yen to exploit the mineral resources of Shilu and desperately developed them. According to statistics, from 1941 to 1945, 620,000 tons of Shilu mineral deposits were mined, 400,000 tons were exported, and approximately 220,000 tons of ore remained in Basuo Port. 2.67 million tons of Tiandu mineral deposits were mined, 2.4 million tons were exported, and approximately 270,000 tons of ore remained in Yulin. From these figures, it can be seen how richly the Japanese have sucked the treasures of our Hainan. Fortunately, since the winter of 1944, the Allied forces launched a counter-offensive. On the Chinese battlefield, large numbers of Allied aircraft constantly bombed important locations on Hainan Island. The two iron ore mines ceased mining operations in January 1945, and the mineral deposits were fortunately preserved to some extent. Here is a report on the general situation of the two mining areas, obtained from relevant sources:</p>
<p>Tiandu Iron Mine</p>
<p>Located at Hongniling, Tiandu Village, about 12 kilometers northeast of Yulin Port, Hainan Island, at an altitude of 100 meters, it is a magnetite mine with a reserve of approximately 10 million tons. The highest content is 68%, and the average is 62%. During the Japanese exploitation period, all aspects were well-equipped, and mechanized mining methods were vigorously implemented. A single-track railway approximately 18 kilometers long was built from Tiandu to Anyeda, and automobiles were also available from the mine to Yulin. Ten 38-ton steam locomotives and 190 20-ton freight cars were provided, with a transport capacity of 4,000 tons per day. In addition, more than 30 various types of civilian ships were set up, and the Yulin Wharf was built to facilitate transportation out of the port. During the peak period of mining in this area, the Japanese recruited as many as 8,000 workers from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shilu Iron Mine</p>
<p>Located northeast of Changjiang County on the west coast of Hainan Island, it is an effusive ore deposit with a quality resembling bean curd. It is crystalline hematite, with the lowest iron content being 62%, the highest being 66%, and the average being 64%. The content of impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, and copper is extremely low. The confirmed reserves are 450 million tons, and the undetermined reserves are approximately 30 million tons or more. When the Japanese occupied the mine, they conducted large-scale exploitation, with a planned output of 3 million tons. At that time, the mining method used was open-pit mining, which could accommodate more than 6,000 people. The main mechanical equipment for mining included pilot machines, rock drilling machines, generators, and various mining machines, not less than ten types, totaling more than 230 vehicles. The transportation equipment included six types of horizontal transport, lifting, train, and loading equipment with more than 560 units. At the same time, more than 900 houses were built, including offices, warehouses, entertainment grounds, repair shops, and dormitories. In terms of mine transportation, a single-track railway approximately 51 kilometers long was built from Shilu to Basuo. In addition, Basuo Port, wharves, and breakwaters were built to facilitate the entry and exit of goods and the transportation of ore. During the Japanese operation, from 1941 to 1945, more than 20,000 miners were recruited in batches from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places.</p>
<p>The Current Assets Committee has decided to develop these two iron ore mines on a large scale. Since the takeover, the desolate scene of the mountains covered with weeds will disappear from now on. (Correspondent Chen Meiqing)</p>

<h3>Qiong Bandits Kill Li and Miao People; Two Thousand Children Forced to Form Red Guards</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hainan Island] After the deployment for suppressing bandits on Hainan Island proceeded smoothly, the sea bandits, after being searched and suppressed by our troops in separate operations, occasionally fled to the Limiao areas belonging to Baihe and Baoting counties, attempting to establish a base in the mountainous area. In that area, all Li and Miao people over 30 years of age who participated in the bandit suppression work or resisted their orders were slaughtered. Those between 18 and 30 years of age were all forced to become bandits. Two thousand Li children between the ages of 16 and 18 were concentrated for training, euphemistically called the Red Guards, and sent out to scout military intelligence, or serve as guides, or act as vanguard troops to die. After receiving the report, the government has made appropriate plans.</p>
<h3>Nantong County Government Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nantong, 9th] The sixth county government conference of this county opened on the 8th. In addition to the district chiefs, the township heads of the first to eighth districts were also summoned to participate. This is a special feature of this conference. County Magistrate Shen said in his opening speech that the current tasks are to suppress the rebellion and bandits and implement the constitution and build the country, so the focus of grassroots work is on the two major issues of "self-defense" and "self-government". The meeting continued on the 9th. Zhou Taolu, the garrison commander of the Nantong area, attended the meeting and explained the current bandit suppression policy, stating that during the political bandit suppression period, the nature of the war has shifted from military-led to political-led, and military-supported. Therefore, to defeat the bandit army, it is first necessary to win the hearts of the people. He explained the pacification policy for this year in detail. The conference had detailed discussions on the elimination of opium, the expansion and merger of townships, and the first phase of conscription work for this year, and agreed on specific measures.</p>
<h3>Cheng County Delegates Meet Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin, 12th] The County Council convened on the 12th. County Magistrate Xu was transferred and went to the province, unable to attend the conference. Police Chief Wei was also dismissed for some reason. The new Chief Zhang Yunzhong has taken over. During the report on the administration work to the conference, officials expressed great dissatisfaction, claiming that the government did not implement the resolutions of the two previous conferences, and that the people's institution had become a mere formality. After discussion, this motion was temporarily reserved. The review committee will meet in the afternoon, and the conference will continue on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Xiqiao Police Station Indiscriminately Arrests Innocents; Bao Chief Petitions and Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Haining, 11th] The Xiqiao Township Police Station in this county arrested Yan Botang and Zhang , the deputy bao chiefs of the fifth bao of the town, on the morning of the 9th for no reason, causing public outrage among all the bao chiefs in the town. They jointly requested bail but were denied. Therefore, on the 10th, they collectively took a bus to the county to petition the county government and submitted their mass resignations, demanding the police station answer three points: Is the arrest of the bao chief without cause against the law? How will the police station's extortion of huge sums be investigated? Why was bail denied? The petition was received by Chief Secretary He of the county government, who repeatedly persuaded them to prioritize local affairs. He assured them that the freedom of the bao chiefs would be guaranteed, and promised to investigate the matter thoroughly.

<p>[Our Dispatch from Lanzhou, 7th] Ms. Qiu Huiying, 30 years old, a resident of 4 Yuanyuan Cang Street in this city, from Xingji, Jiangxi, suddenly attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills the night before last. The next morning, she was discovered by neighbors and sent to the Catholic Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, it was not too late, and she was revived. Last night, the reporter went to Ward 36 of the hospital to inquire about the truth of the suicide. The circumstances were tortuous, pitiful, and worthy of tears!</p>
<p>It turned out that Qiu's husband, Ouyang Bulun, when he was the county magistrate of Weiyuan County, Gansu, in 1946, was accused by local bullies to the provincial government for having his secretary, Ge Min, embezzle relief funds from the Tianlan Road project and loan them out. The provincial government immediately dismissed Ouyang and others for investigation and detained them in the detention center of the Security Command, not allowing them to contact the outside world. Ouyang's wife, Qiu Huiying, with her husband in custody, unable to swallow her food, went out to find food and clothing, and sent food to Ouyang twice a day. Over the years, all the clothes in the house had been pawned.</p>
<p>When Ouyang was first detained, many good people in Weiyuan spoke out in his support, and he was declared innocent. The civil part was sent to the Gaozhi District Court for trial, and he was also acquitted for insufficient crimes. Prosecutor Cai Xiaoxuan believed that this was unacceptable and filed a public prosecution. The High Court passed a judgment on the 3rd of this month, still finding him innocent. However, Prosecutor Cai still did not allow him to regain his freedom, saying that he would not be released until ten days later (the 13th of this month), and that it would be determined whether to file another public prosecution. He also said: If you want to be free, you must pay a bail of 50 million yuan. Qiu, having nothing to pawn and unable to borrow, feeling alone, had the thought of being tired of the world.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiu said in a miserable and tragic tone: "My husband has been in prison for more than a year, and there is only me, a woman, in the family. Currently, the family is destitute, and I can hardly manage two meals a day. Where can I get tens of millions of yuan to pay? I am an educated woman, and when I send food to the prison every day, I don't dare to tell my husband about my difficulties, lest he be even more upset. I have vomited blood several times after suffering more than a year of torment. The day before yesterday, I even tore off the only cotton quilt cover I had in the house and sold it. I thought that since my husband was innocent, he could rebuild the family and be a good person after being released from prison. Now everything has become a bubble. What is the point of me living? ..." She could not finish her words because of sobbing.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiu lay on the hospital bed, and in the dim light, her face looked even more haggard, undoubtedly the result of a year and a half of painful torment. According to the doctor, although she is out of danger, she still faints from time to time. She often whispers "Prosecutor Cai, spare me!..." A female reporter from a certain newspaper who went with her was also moved by her bitter account and shed tears silently. Before leaving, she donated her only 400,000 yuan to her. This matter has aroused widespread sympathy from the public.</p>
<h3>Tax Collection Offices in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Should Directly Collect Taxes to Promote Legal Income and Eliminate Illegal Apportionment</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 12th] The provincial government believes that all taxes in the province should be directly collected by the tax collection offices, and that fixed quotas and commissioned collection have long been among the serious malpractices. According to reports, various county and city bureaus still collect business, slaughter, banquet, and entertainment taxes in the name of simplified tax collection, continuing bad habits, and apportioning quotas through chambers of commerce, trade associations, or restaurants and theaters, with open collection and secret commission. This turns legal income into illegal apportionment, and the provincial government has issued a special order to strictly prohibit this in all counties, and those who advance this practice will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Municipal Specialist College Principals' Meeting Decides on Tuition Standard for Next Semester; Tentatively Calculated at Three to Four "Shi" of Rice</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] As this semester is about to end, the tuition fees for students at various private colleges next semester have garnered attention from all quarters. The principals of private specialist colleges and universities in this city, taking into account both reasonable treatment for faculty and the financial burden that student parents can bear, convened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Tsinghua Alumni Association to discuss the matter. President Ou Yuanhuai of Great China University served as chairman of the meeting. For half an hour before and after the meeting, the more than twenty representatives from various schools remained silent, indicating that this doubly "extremely difficult to resolve" contradictory issue further increased its severity, and that each harbored heavy distress. President Ou reported on the significance of the meeting, saying: "In our discussion today of the tuition fees for various schools next semester, we should first consider the reasonable treatment of faculty, as this is the largest and primary expenditure for each school. The government has already decided that the treatment of faculty in national institutions will be calculated according to the cost-of-living index from this month, and adjusted every three months. Private school tuition fees cannot be increased twice, and the difficulties of both faculty and students must be considered and addressed simultaneously. I hope for a detailed discussion to arrive at a reasonable solution." After President Ou's remarks, the principals looked at each other in silence. After half an hour, Shen Sizhuang of China Vocational School of Commerce and Industry finally spoke, explaining that current prices are rising like runaway horses, and faculty treatment is too low, making it impossible to teach with peace of mind. He also said that two-fifths of the students at his school will be forced to discontinue their studies next semester. Subsequently, principals and representatives from various schools spoke one after another, engaging in heated debate. Finally, it was decided that, given the current high price situation and to take into account the difficulties of student parents, the tuition and miscellaneous fees for each school next semester will be calculated based on the current market price of rice, tentatively set at three to four "shi." If special circumstances arise at that time, another meeting will be convened to make a decision. In addition, to discuss common issues of private colleges, in addition to continuing to participate in the Shanghai Specialist College and University Federation, it was decided to convene a joint conference of private specialist colleges and universities on a regular basis in the future, with each private school taking turns being responsible for convening it. The principals and representatives from various private schools who attended the meeting yesterday were Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua, Tu Yuxiang of St. John's, Ling Xianzhang of Shanghai University, Situ Bo of Dental College, Chu Fengyi of Shanghai Law College, Guo Xiaoxian of the College of Political Science and Law, Qian Sujun of Lixin, Zu Shi of Guanghua Business College, Shen Sizhuang of China Vocational School of Commerce and Industry, Hu Dunfu of Datong, Hu Wenyao of Aurora, Lü Yunming of Southeast Medical College, Jiang Weiqiao of Chengming Arts and Sciences College, Wang Mengfeng of Nantong College, Lu Xirong of New China College of Law and Commerce, Wang Zhenchang of Wuxi National College, Chen Gao of Xin Zhuan, Yan Jiuliang of Suzhou Art College, Liu Haisu of Shanghai Art College, Zhou Chengen of Soochow, and Chen Mengyu of East Asia Physical Education College, among more than twenty others.</p>
<h3>List of Scholarship Students: Urge Early Submission</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee recently sent a letter to various schools in the city, hoping that they would submit the list of students with both good moral character and academic performance to the committee before the 15th of this month to determine the quota of scholarship students for each school next semester, so that scholarships can be issued to students before the 10th of next month. In addition, the City Scholarship Unified Review Committee is scheduled to hold a standing meeting next Thursday to discuss fundraising for scholarships next semester.</p>
<p>[Another News Item] Private specialist colleges and universities in this city decided at a meeting yesterday to make the following two recommendations to the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee: It is hoped that the total amount of scholarships for the next semester will be increased to 15 billion yuan (compared to 5 billion yuan this semester). The course work for all schools this semester will end at the end of the month, and students with both good moral character and academic performance must be evaluated after the grades are calculated. It is hoped that the committee will reserve the scholarship quota for each school and send the list of scholarship recipients later.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University President Talks About Faculty Treatment Issues</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ling Xianzhang, president of the private Shanghai University, spoke to reporters yesterday about the issue of faculty treatment involved in student tuition fees for the next semester. He said that if faculty members cooperate with the school and increase their weekly teaching hours, their hourly pay at this school will increase, and their lives can be stabilized. They will not have to teach part-time at other schools, and the school can hire fewer faculty, so students can pay less tuition. This can solve both problems at once. He said: "American universities are still like wartime, and professors teach more than fourteen hours a week." Ling appealed at the end that this year is the beginning of constitutional governance, and private schools are also cultivating talents for the government. The government should provide as much economic assistance as possible.</p>
<h3>Trisecting Any Angle Is Not Difficult: Reader Writes to This Newspaper to State</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 12th] A reader here today wrote to this newspaper, saying that trisecting any angle is not a difficult problem. However, his method is different from the principle of Yang Jiaru described in the Shanghai Central News Agency's telegraph on the 6th. According to him, twenty years ago, he heard Professor Jin Lingyi at Beiyang University say that there were many solutions to this difficult problem in a certain Japanese book. One is as follows, and it only requires a ruler, while Mr. Yang still needs a compass. The method is: on the "AB" side of angle "ABC", take any point D, make line "DG" perpendicular to "BC", and make line "DP" parallel to "BC". Use a ruler to pass through point B and move it within this angle to make line "BE", intersecting line "DG" at F and intersecting line "DP" at E, but "FE" must be twice the length of "BD", then "BE" trisects angle "ABC".</p>
<h3>Changchun University Dean of Academic Affairs Zhang Dexin's Opinion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] Dr. Zhang Dexin, Dean of Academic Affairs of Changchun University, recently expressed his doubts about the "trisection of any angle," one of the world's seven major scientific mysteries, which was solved by Mr. Yang Jiaru of Shanghai, as published by the Central News Agency on the 6th. He believes that it is impossible to trisect an arbitrary angle using only a ruler and compass. Zhang studied mathematics and physics in Germany for many years and obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Berlin. He said: In mathematics, if you want to represent a number with the length of a straight line or use a number to represent the length of a straight line, you must first define the unit length. Then you can use a compass to draw a unit circle, and then you can easily construct any angle. Use a ruler and compass to construct a straight line length equivalent to the cosine of this angle. Conversely, if you have the cosine length of an angle, you can also construct this angle, as long as this angle does not exceed 180 degrees. He also said: An angle of 120 degrees is easy to construct with a ruler and compass, and its chord of negative one-half is also easy to construct. If an angle of 120 degrees can be trisected with a ruler and compass, then, of course, the cosine of 40 degrees should be able to be constructed with a ruler and compass, but this is not the case. Zhang said: I can use Y to represent the cosine of 40 degrees. From the trigonometric formula, it is not difficult to deduce that the cosine of 120 degrees is equal to four multiplied by the cube of Y minus three times Y, divided by two. Replace the cosine of 120 degrees with negative two-thirds in this equation, and you get negative one equal to eight multiplied by the cube of Y minus six times Y. If you use X to replace two Y, and then move the negative one to the other side, you get the cube of X minus three times X plus one not equal to zero. This is a three-degree cubic equation. According to a theorem of the equation theory, it can be known that this equation has at least one real number root. According to another theorem, we know that any root of this equation is not a rational number. Zhang finally affirmed that if a root of a cubic equation with rational numbers as coefficients is not a rational number, then the length of the straight line corresponding to this root cannot be constructed with a ruler and compass. Since X cannot be constructed, and X is equal to half of X, then Y cannot be constructed either. Y is the cosine of 40 degrees. Since the cosine of 40 degrees cannot be constructed, the angle of 40 degrees cannot be constructed either. Zhang continued to criticize Yang Jiaru's claim that any angle can be trisected. He said: Since an angle of 120 degrees can also be trisected, then, of course, angles of 60 degrees, 30 degrees, 15 degrees, 7.5 degrees, etc. cannot be constructed either. With these angles that cannot be constructed, it can certainly be said that an arbitrary angle cannot be trisected with a ruler and compass, but this arbitrary angle cannot be changed to "any angle," because angles of 180 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees, 22.5 degrees, etc. can be trisected with a ruler and compass. However, this cannot be said to be a "new invention."</p>

<p>In the third basketball league, there will be three men's A-division matches today, starting at 5:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. In A2-division B, Jiashen will face V Team. In A1-division, there will be two matches: Shan Team will face the American Military Police, and Dagong will face Qingbai. Tickets are 10,000 yuan upstairs, 20,000 yuan downstairs, and 50,000 yuan with assigned seats in the stadium. Sales start at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The Siwei Boy Scouts will still be on site to maintain order. The program is recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiashen — V Team (A2 B) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Shan Team — American Military Police (A1) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Dagong — Qingbai (A1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Jiashen has been dispatched twice, successively defeating Yizhong and Peer. V Team suffered Jiashen's poisonous hand in the Chenyou Cup. Today, the road is narrow. A tough battle is predicted.</p>
<p>In the A1 division, Shan Team meets the American Military Police. Because Cai Yanxiong is playing for Qingbai, and Lin Weicong has returned to his hometown, the strength of the team has been greatly affected. However, the military appearance is still relatively complete. The American Military Police have lost two matches out of two, and their strength is mediocre. Shan Team should have no problem winning.</p>
<p>The match between Dagong and Qingbai is the highlight of today's program. Dagong has gathered famous generals, and their momentum is strong. Under the leadership of Cai Yanxiong, the old generals of the Qingbai team have not diminished in their power and will certainly pose a threat to Dagong.</p>
<p>[Dagong] Cai Lianke (Captain), Tu Wenlong (Vice Captain), Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Cai Zhongqiang, Huang Bogui, Zhan Chen, Zhang Gensheng, Wang Nanfei, Pan Jiong.</p>
<p>[Qingbai] Cai Yanxiong (Captain), Zhang Shaoqing, Tang Shikun, Zhou Dayun, Wang Junbing, Ku Yao Ya, Xu Heng, Zhuo Guorong, Wang Nanzhen, Chen Xianglong.</p>
<h3>Football Referees Association Monthly Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Football Referees Association is scheduled to hold a monthly meeting at 6:00 PM today at the Donghua Association Hall on Fuxing Middle Road. Both Presidents Lu and Tan will also attend to preside over the meeting. All members are requested to be on time to discuss progress together.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Check Clearing House has reached a mature stage in preparing for the group-based direct exchange system, and the site layout has also been completed in order. It is expected to begin implementation on February 21 (i.e., January 12 of the lunar calendar) and is scheduled to be divided into four groups for direct exchange.</p>
<h3>Financial Department Stipulates Strict Crackdown on Suspended Firms Failing to Liquidate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that, in order to protect the interests of depositors and rectify financial discipline, the Ministry of Finance has decided to severely crack down on suspended financial firms that fail to liquidate. It recently stipulated that if the party suspending clearing is a branch, the branch should be ordered to suspend clearing and the Ministry should order the revocation of the original approval for the establishment of the branch. In addition, the liquidation responsibility should be borne by the head office. If the head office fails to complete the liquidation within the time limit, then the financial firm is deemed unable to continue operating and can be considered to have reason to be dissolved. Its license can be revoked and the firm and its branches ordered to suspend operations and liquidate.</p>
<h3>National Bank Adjusts Exchange Rates in Various Locations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Bank adjusted the exchange rates in various locations as follows: Guangzhou 160 yuan per 1,000 yuan (originally 100 yuan), Shantou Haikou Quanzhou 160 yuan (originally 150 yuan), Bazhou Nanning 90 yuan (originally 80 yuan), Changsha Hengyang 90 yuan (originally 10 yuan), Tunxi Shexian 60 yuan (originally 50 yuan), Hankou Wuchang 90 yuan (originally 20 yuan), Shashi Yichang 100 yuan (originally 60 yuan), Wenzhou 70 yuan (originally 60 yuan), Xufu Wanxian 15 yuan (originally 25 yuan), Henan 80 yuan (originally 6 yuan), Guizhou 50 yuan (originally 2 yuan).</p>
<h3>Business Federation Requests Appropriate Opening of Loans</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the lunar New Year is approaching and various industrial and commercial circles have repeatedly requested the association to ask the government to open up a portion of legitimate loans, the National Business Federation telegraphed Chairman Jiang and the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Bank, the Joint Treasury, and other relevant authorities on the 12th. The telegram stated that since the lunar New Year is the routine accounting period, debts and credits need to be cleared separately. It requests authorities to consider the actual needs and appropriately open up lending.</p>
<p>[Another News Item] Since the suspension of industrial and commercial loans, there has been strong demand from all parties. The authorities are still considering the matter. According to sources, the authorities are finding it difficult to make a decision. If dealt with too strictly, the lunar New Year may lead to the closure of some manufacturers. If dealt with too leniently, it will inevitably fuel speculation. They are currently studying the targets and will adopt a moderate approach, limiting lending to public utilities and those related to people's livelihood. However, the decision-making direction still awaits a decision by the Joint Treasury Council.</p>

<h3>Tight Credit, Scarce Transactions, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Generally Decline, China Textile Construction Opens Yarn Sales at Regular Price, Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw the China Textile Construction Company open sales as usual, with no change in allocation prices. Market conditions were sluggish due to tighter credit. Merchants and factories were hesitant, and some peers were selling at a loss. Transactions within the market were obstructed, and prices gradually weakened. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to fall by 300,000 yuan compared to the weekend, down to a low of 6,120,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell slightly, by 1 million to 1.56 million yuan. The cotton cloth market opened in the morning with a large amount of sales by China Textile Construction Company on Saturday. Peers were facing tight credit, and retail investors were unloading a significant amount. Further influenced by rumors of currency reform, public sentiment was very uncertain. Buyers handling yarn and cloth registration were mostly observing, and the market trend hovered downstream. Near closing, due to some replenishment of white cloth by dyeing factories, and a small amount of absorption by customers from Xuzhou and Bengbu, prices slightly rebounded. However, the final twelve-pound Dragon Head and other grades of fine cloth uniformly declined by 15,000 to 25,000 yuan.

<h3>On the Value of Science</h3>
<p>— Hong Qian</p>
<p>When we talk about the value of science, we often associate it with its usefulness. It seems that whether science has "usefulness" in practical life is the standard for whether science has value. This is not just something we say off the cuff. Even the German scientist W. Ostwald mentioned this point in his "Outline of Natural Philosophy": "The value of scientific knowledge, whether in the past or present, lies in its general 'usefulness'. The pursuit of knowledge, scientific research, with itself as the goal, without regard to other practical effects. Such as so-called seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge, seeking truth for the sake of truth. Completely out of the fallacy of idealism, but in this way, the value of science has been reduced a lot."</p>
<p>Ostwald's view of the value of science naturally has its factual basis. The reason why we associate the value of science with its "usefulness" is not entirely without reason. Indeed, scientific knowledge, and even science itself, whether in origin or development, is closely related to human practical life. If we look at geometry, the word "geometry" itself contains the meaning of "land surveying"; the basic concepts and field observations of astronomy originated from the professional needs of prophets; chemical analysis began for the effect of "alchemy." Even many scientific theories that are biased towards theoretical research and do not focus on practical "usefulness" eventually make great indirect contributions to society and life. For example, Faraday's research never considered the problems of the electrical industry, but what is its impact on the modern electrical industry? Pasteur's research was also purely theoretical, but what is its result for the role of modern medical treatment? Who knew that the discovery of radium could treat cancer with its radiant energy? In addition, many inventions in the field of science and technology are all obviously born out of adapting to the requirements of practical life and out of the needs of the society at that time.</p>
<p>Although we value science from the perspective of "usefulness," it is not without reason and not without basis, but it does not have sufficient reason and sufficient basis. Because if we make a judgment on the value of science, we are in fact trying to point out its "cultural significance" in the contemporary social environment and in personal life; at the same time, the "cultural significance" it gains in a certain era is the standard and content of a certain value concept of science. Can we judge the value of human knowledge in primitive times from its "usefulness"? Because in that era, our view of knowledge can only be said to be purely for survival and for what is needed for survival. What is the "cultural significance" of knowledge in that era? At most, we can only call it a tool for "maintaining survival," right? We can also judge the human knowledge of early culture from its "usefulness": because the role of knowledge in that era is also inseparable from the scope of practical life. So its cultural significance, in addition to being a method for survival competition, has no other significance to speak of. But it is fundamentally impossible to judge scientific knowledge formed after several stages of cultural development solely from its "usefulness."</p>
<p>The reason why we believe that judging contemporary scientific knowledge or scientists solely from their "usefulness" is because the scientific knowledge theory and its cultural role that we see today are neither a tool for "maintaining survival" like in primitive times, nor a method for "survival competition" like in the early stages of culture, but have its new functions and new meanings in addition to practical "usefulness." Do great discoveries of our time, such as the theory of relativity and quantum theory, have direct "usefulness" for practical life? Is it a tool for maintaining survival? Is it a method for "survival competition"? Regarding these scientific theories representing the era, not only can we not judge their value from their "usefulness," but also their theories themselves and their impact on human spirit and thought cannot be understood and recognized by those who only talk about "usefulness."</p>
<p>From this point alone, we can already understand that today's so-called science has in fact long been separated from being a "method to achieve survival goals," and has long become an independent, autonomous activity with its own purpose. This is the new meaning and new role of modern science that we mentioned above. In fact, in the development of social culture, it is not only the evolutionary process of science that is like this, but also the development of other things, and even the entire human culture, is the same. For example, whether it is "seeing," "hearing," "speaking," or "acting," what was most obviously a tool for "maintaining survival" and a necessity in "survival competition" in the past has long been developed into an inevitable phenomenon in "cultural life." Because what we call "observation" with artistic significance is also a kind of "seeing"; what we call "listening" with appreciative significance is also a kind of "hearing"; what about "singing" and "dancing" with spiritual significance, aren't they a kind of "speaking" and a kind of "acting"? Examples like this are truly endless. However, we can already understand from this that the formation and development of any cultural society is nothing more than first separating from being a "method to achieve survival goals" and becoming an independent, autonomous activity or action with its own purpose.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we correctly understand the value of science, or in other words, understand the new cultural science of science, whether it is literature, poetry, music, art, or even "observation," "listening," "singing," and "dancing," can all increase our interest in life, enrich the meaning of life, satisfy the desires in our ideals, and enrich the realm in our experiences. Writers, poets, artists, and musicians each have their own realm, such as the so-called realm of literature, the realm of poetry, the realm of art, and the realm of music. Similarly, scientists also have their scientific realm. The reason why scientists tirelessly pursue knowledge and truth is to "seek knowledge for the sake of knowledge and truth for the sake of truth," just like writers, poets, artists, and musicians want to enrich and expand, and even create their realms of literature, realms of poetry, realms of art, and realms of music. Ostwald, as a scientist, does not know that science also has its independent realm, so he believes that "seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge and truth for the sake of truth" is a fallacy of idealism. I really don't know if this has reduced science's value as science by "a lot."</p>
<p>In summary, the value of scientific knowledge or science is not only in its "usefulness." Although the "usefulness" or "general usefulness" of science to human society can represent a part of the value of science, it cannot represent the entirety of the value of science. Just as applied science has made many contributions to contemporary civilization, it cannot represent the entirety of the value of science. The reason why the views of science value held by most people and Ostwald are not sufficient reasons or bases, and cannot become true concepts of scientific value, is because they are obscured by the status of knowledge in past social culture, and neglect its status in today's social culture; because they are obscured by the value of science in material life, and neglect its value in spiritual life and emotional life. The German philosopher Voihinger said it well in his "Philosophy of As If" regarding why science is science: "Scientific research has its own interest and pleasure. This interest and pleasure is included in science itself, and cannot be analyzed from its application. The world mostly regards science as a factory for the production of all practical applications, technologies, or tools. This erroneous view of science, I don't know if it is deliberately insulting science, or if it simply does not know science. Strictly speaking, science is a luxury item, but such a luxury item is necessary for noble human beings, and is also necessary in human civilized society. Naturally, such a luxury item with a noble meaning for human culture is not just science, but also philosophy, literature, poetry, music, art, and so on!"</p>
<h3>A New Interpretation of the Eight Items of the Great Learning</h3>
<p>— Jun Yang</p>
<p>The "Great Learning" has what is called "Three Outlines" and "Eight Items." Someone has already written to explain the "Three Outlines," and now I would like to offer a new interpretation of the "Eight Items" for scholars to consider.</p>
<p>"To manifest illustrious virtue throughout the world" means that the ruler extends matters from himself to others. He deeply realizes the interconnected virtue of empathy, the so-called "benevolence," and has a deep understanding of the unity of self and others. Merely understanding virtue within oneself and not planning for others would make the matter seem incomplete and leave something lacking in oneself. Therefore, he must ensure that people throughout the world manifest their own virtues. However, the world is the union of states, so one must first govern the state; the state is the accumulation of families, so one must first regulate the family; the family is the gathering of individuals, so one must first cultivate oneself. Whether one cultivates oneself or not lies in one's actions and behavior; the master of oneself is the heart. However, the movements of the heart that manifest in actions and behavior are in fact distinguished and influenced by the heart. If the heart is not rectified, then one cannot cultivate oneself. Therefore, it is said, "Those who wish to cultivate themselves must first rectify their hearts." The thoughts that originate from the heart are called intentions. The heart is the totality of intentions; sincerity of intention means that one's thoughts are none other than the ultimate Dao principles of heaven and earth, without any falsehood or impurity within. "Those who wish to rectify their hearts must first make their intentions sincere." Intention is part of the heart, and the heart is the entirety of intention. There is no case where the part is insincere, and the whole can be knowing; and what is called rectifying the heart is precisely making the heart sincere. "Knowledge" is like understanding and reasoning, and it is why intentions are made sincere. "Attaining" is reaching the extreme; if knowledge does not reach the extreme, then its sincerity is incomplete, so it is said, "Those who wish to make their intentions sincere must first attain their knowledge." What is meant by "attaining knowledge through the investigation of things" is that "investigating" means reaching and exhaustively examining; "things" refers to all matters and objects. Principles reside in things, and if one wishes to understand and reason, one must seek it within things. If knowledge does not reach things, then what is known is empty and without foundation. If things are not exhaustively examined to the point of discerning their principles, then what is understood is partial and incomplete. All investigating things, attaining knowledge, making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, and cultivating oneself are matters of manifesting one's virtue and renewing oneself. As for regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven, these are efforts to enable others to manifest their virtue and are the work of renewing the people. Investigating things and attaining knowledge are used to clarify the ultimate good, which is knowing; making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven are used to reach the ultimate good, which is action.</p>
<p>"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must regard self-cultivation as the root" means that self-cultivation is in fact about investigating things, attaining knowledge, making intentions sincere, and rectifying the heart. When these five matters are complete, one will not fail to be a virtuous person. One can retreat and establish oneself, and advance and establish others. Establishing oneself is for the people, and establishing others is for the ruler. Those who serve the people can advance and become rulers, and those who are rulers can retreat and serve the people. Is this not the true meaning of democratic politics? Therefore, it is said that the political ideal of Confucianism, the so-called kingly way, while outwardly having a ruler, is in essence democratic. "When the root is disordered and the branches are well-governed..." The "root" refers to oneself, and the "branches" refer to others. Our Confucianism takes ethics as the root of politics. The key to governance lies in nurturing good talents, sending them out to extend what they have cultivated in themselves to govern others. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Governing depends on people," which is the same meaning. If one does not educate and nurture the people, causing them to each fulfill the matter of self-cultivation, and merely uses laws and punishments to guide and regulate them, then those who wield power in the future will all be today's unrestrained and shameless people. What is expected of their governance will also be no more than unrestrained and shameless governance. Gradually, this will inevitably lead to chaos. This is for no other reason than that the root is disordered, and it is impossible to want the branches to be well-governed. "What is esteemed is meager, while what is meager is esteemed" means that "what is esteemed" refers to the family, and "what is meager" refers to the state and the world. Governing lies in practicing benevolence, and the method of practicing benevolence is simply extending love. What people love most is their family. The way of governing lies in enabling people throughout the world to extend what they love in their families to love the state and to love the world. If one is meager towards one's family, then the source of love is blocked, and how can one extend it to the state and the world? Our Confucian emphasis on the root is because we deeply understand human nature, and we can take advantage of it and guide it. What is human nature? It is simply that each person loves his or her family. What is this advantage and guidance? It is clarifying that all people are born together between heaven and earth, that human nature and my nature both originate from heavenly principles, that self and others originally belong to one body, and that extending one's love for family to love for the state and the world is merely a matter of doing it or not doing it, willing it or not willing it. Conversely, if a person cannot love his or her family and seeks to love the state and the world, then this is acting against nature. Therefore, it is said, "There has never been such a thing."</p>
<h3>From Concrete to Abstract</h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>The two terms "concrete" and "abstract" were introduced from the West. "Concrete," the original English word is Concrete; "abstract," the original English word is Abstract. Concrete originates from the Latin word Concretus, Concretus is the past participle of the verb Concrescere, meaning to solidify or coalesce. Abstract originates from the Latin word Abstractus, Abstractus is the past participle of the verb Abstrahere, meaning to extract or draw away. By extension, anything that coalesces into a body, with a form that can be perceived by the senses, is called concrete; anything that extracts form, cannot be perceived by the senses, but is only thought of by the mental faculty, is called abstract.</p>
<p>For example, a thing that can be seen and touched is called concrete. A concept existing in the mind, such as "white" or "square," which cannot be seen or touched, but can only be thought of, is called abstract. The concept of "white," the concept of "square," is extracted from a thing at a certain time and place. A thing at a certain time and place is limited by the time and space of that time and place; it is specific. What is extracted from it, such as the concepts of "white" and "square," is not limited by time and space; it is universal. The specific must be singular, like this table, there is only this one. The universal, however, is countless; like tables, all tables are included, and any table at any time and place is called a table. Another example is the falling of a person from a building, or the flowing of water downwards; these are specific, individual instances. As for the force of gravity, which can encompass all falling instances, this is a universal principle. Therefore, we say: things and events are concrete, and also specific; reason and principle are abstract, and also universal; the perception of a thing or event by the senses is concrete, and also specific; the concept of the reason and principle of things in thought is abstract, and also universal. In China, we have the saying, "That which is above form is called the Dao, that which is below form is called the instrument" (from the Great Treatise of the Book of Changes, section 12). "Above form" is abstract, "below form" is concrete, "Dao" is reason and principle, "instrument" is things and events.</p>
<p>The ability to abstract is inherent to humans, and also unique to humans. The key to human culture lies in this. The more advanced the culture, the higher the ability to abstract. The ability to abstract first appears in language. Language can be considered humanity's earliest cultural creation. The basic elements of language are verbs and nouns. Verbs and nouns are abstract symbols created by humans to represent concrete things, and the movement and state of things (Action and state). Nouns and verbs combine to form sentences, and sentences are used to record experience, and transmit experience. (So-called experience is the experience of humans with things and their dynamics.) Experience can be accumulated through recording, and exchanged through transmission. The accumulation, progress, and dissemination of culture all rely on the function of language (including writing).</p>
<p>Humans can only have learning with language. Learning is the experience one gains oneself, asking is obtaining the experience of others. One's own experience cannot be accumulated without language, and the experience of others cannot be acquired without language; therefore, it is said that there is learning only after language.</p>
<p>The work of learning lies in seeking universal and abstract principles and examples. These principles and examples are obtained from the specific and concrete things and their dynamics that humans have experienced. The purpose is, on the one hand, to satisfy the desire for knowledge, and on the other hand, to adapt to practical needs. Things and their dynamics are scattered, complex, and changing. With a finite life, limited intellect, and short memory, one cannot experience everything one by one, and so one must resort to convenience: that is, seeking totality in the scattered, simplicity in the complex, and constancy in the changing. The results sought and obtained are reason and principle. Furthermore, the arrangement of the universe is not only that there is totality in the scattered, simplicity in the complex, and constancy in the changing, but also that totality can encompass the scattered, simplicity can govern the complex, and constancy can balance the changing. Thus, the reason and principle that humans seek not only satisfy the desire for knowledge, but can also be "utilized" to achieve the effect of "enriching life." Therefore, learning has two aspects, knowledge and action. The learning of the knowledge aspect is like modern pure science (Pure science), the learning of the action aspect is like modern applied science (Applied science). Pure science explores the universal and abstract principles and examples in specific and concrete things, and applied science studies how to implement these principles and examples in various things and objects, and obtain practical benefits.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the development of human intellect and the progress of culture proceed from the concrete to the abstract. It begins with the specific things perceived by the senses, and reaches the universal principles and examples thought of by the mind. The more things perceived, the more accurate and certain the principles and examples obtained, and the deeper and broader the knowledge and understanding. Conversely, the more precise the principles and examples obtained, the more things perceived, and the greater the efficacy of controlling the environment. The entire evolution of culture is always proceeding back and forth on the path of concrete to abstract, and abstract to concrete.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from Academic Circles</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Essentials of Military Building</p>
<p>Modern military strength is actually the manifestation of overall national strength. Military building and nation-building are inherently consistent. Without a grand and far-reaching scale of nation-building, the ultimate goal of military building cannot be achieved. If military building is not in line with the ideals of nation-building, it will not only deplete the national treasury, but also make things more chaotic. Nation-building requires four forces, namely, human resources, material resources, academic resources, and finally, the power of universal virtue, which can be called the four cornerstones. The essentials of military building should also be none other than these.</p>
<p>U.S. General Marshall believed that too many standing troops are not suitable for modern democratic countries. He advocated military training for young people to provide the country with an unlimited source of troops to supplement the inadequacy of standing troops. China should prepare for this matter at its own pace and seek practical results. Military training should not only refer to basic training in modern weapons; academic subjects should be given equal emphasis as practical subjects. The Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Education should make thorough designs and not be perfunctory in their implementation. Universal training is certainly the fundamental plan for military building. For the time being, even addressing the immediate problem, that is, the education of the current millions of soldiers, is already a uniquely great adult education program in Chinese history. It includes three aspects: First, basic education should be implemented to eliminate illiteracy. Second, they should understand the history and geography of their own country and the international situation to cultivate civic knowledge. Third, they should be taught practical knowledge such as house building, ditch digging, gardening, and crafts to cultivate employment skills after retirement. Military education should be coordinated with military life and should be rich in variety to increase interest. Noble forms of entertainment such as music and art should also not be neglected. In the future, the problem of teachers will inevitably be a major difficulty. The principles of moving schools to troops or moving troops to schools can be experimented with. How should time be allocated? Can one day be set aside each week as an education day? All of these should refer to the effective methods already tested by other countries for reference. What we have described above should not be regarded as too lofty. This is the starting point for raising the standard of living for the people.</p>
<p>The issue of material resources, all development of national resources is related to national defense. The way to strengthen the army should be embodied in enriching the country. A vast military expenditure cannot be borne by the national treasury, so private enterprises should be able to be quickly converted to military use, and military uses should also be able to be quickly converted to civilian use. Only with armament can one resist war. During the war, the United States was called the arsenal of democratic countries, producing more than 10,000 aircraft annually. The aluminum required for its aircraft, utilizing the power of the Tennessee River for manufacturing, accounted for 60 percent. The nitric acid, the raw material for bomber bombs, was also mostly obtained from it. The T.V.A. system was originally a form of local economic construction, beneficial to people's livelihood in peacetime and helpful to national defense in wartime. The cause of enrichment and strength comes from the same source. Modern warfare is scientific warfare, and scientific progress and achievements have changed the entire strategy accordingly. The fate of the country can be said to depend on scientific research. Science is the seed, invention is the fruit. Material resources are only a potential. With academic resources, they can be transformed into real strength. The Marshall Research Institute is far more important than the arsenal. The arsenal may be full of weapons and military equipment, but they will soon become old and unusable. Churchill once called the future empire the "Empires of Mind." Those who are less intellectually capable cannot be said to be strong even if they are thousands of feet high, and cannot be said to be solid even if they are in the midst of ten thousand miles of waves. However, ordinary people often think that science relies solely on reason, but in fact, the true scientific spirit always contains noble morality. Take radar (or radiolocation) as an example. Radar is an instrument for measuring position and distance by radio methods and can be translated as a "surveillance instrument." This type of instrument can be used to detect the traces of enemy aircraft and submarines and repel them, and can also be used to accurately bomb through clouds and fog. It is not only the most effective new weapon for the army, navy, and air force in wartime, but also makes a great contribution to the safety of sea and air transport after the war. The invention of radar is really the result of the combination of spirit and technology. Although the basis is the scientists' diligent research in peacetime, if they were not brave and united during wartime, it would not be able to meet the urgent needs of wartime, this is the first. The government has a generous and enlightened policy on academic research, and scholars are also sincerely patriotic and keep secrets. The government and universities have a full spirit of cooperation, this is the second. The Englishman Robert Watson-Watt once said that the close cooperation between military experts, industrialists, and scientists is the real secret weapon of the United Kingdom. (See his article "The Relationship between Radar and War and Peace", published in the British weekly magazine Nature, September 15, 1945) Also, if a new invention is to be applied to combat, it must rely on the cultivation of new talents. The training and organization of talents cannot be led without morality, this is the third. Although major strategies are designed by the military, those in charge of national military affairs should be politicians rather than military personnel. In national defense and diplomacy, there must be a spirit of national unity. The decision-making of national defense plans and diplomatic policies must go beyond political party interests. Without virtuous men, how can a country be established? This is the fourth. All of the above are precious lessons and experiences from World War II. Without deeply understanding the lessons of history, rising up and striving for it, there is no way to build an army or a country.</p>

<h3>Marriage Matters</h3>
<p>— Yuan Liang</p>
<p>The marriage between the son of the provincial chairman and the niece of the provincial government secretary-general can be considered a perfect match. Look at the news published in the Central Daily News on the sixth, about the marriage of the eldest son of Liu Wenhui, the chairman of Xikang Province, and the niece of Deng Hanxiang, the secretary-general of the Sichuan Provincial Government. Not only is their status enviable, but the degree of extravagance is truly worthy of envy by people all over the world! Let's take a look at the programs such as giving gifts:</p>
<p>"All the gifts filled two hundred boxes. From Liu's mansion on Xinyu Sha Street, North Gate, the line stretched for two or three miles. Citizens watching along the way rubbed shoulders, and there was a sea of people. Among the gifts, the pillows alone numbered four hundred pairs, worth about 150 million yuan. The porcelain was worth 1 billion yuan, including four palace lanterns, made of 48 taels of gold, inlaid with jewels. Liu's son-in-law, Wu Peiying, presented a picture of a gold money curtain inlaid with eight treasures, dazzling and invaluable. It is estimated that 160 tables of banquets have been booked, with a deposit of more than 30 million yuan, and more than 100 tables of evening snacks have been prepared. The cost of each table of snacks is worth 160,000 yuan. In addition, a large number of noble handkerchiefs are prepared for distribution to relatives and friends (omitted below)."</p>
<p>Marriage is a lifelong event, and of course it cannot be taken lightly, but is such extravagance too much? The author does not understand the customs of Sichuan and Xikang. Do pillows need to be changed every day?</p>
<p>I ask, what are all these things for in one marriage? Besides "showing off wealth," what else is the meaning? Speaking of this young master Liu Yuanyan, although he is already twenty-eight years old, he is still studying in the Department of Sociology at West China University. The bride, Hu Wenqu, is also studying together. Neither of them are producing people. Of course, these gifts were prepared by their parents. The government orders and reiterates to the people to practice thrift. The chairman of the province and the secretary-general are the highest examples for the people of the province. Not only do they not lead in thrift, but they intensify it to this extent! There are hundreds of millions of starving refugees in the country crying for food, and university students in Beijing and Shanghai are running and shouting in the cold wind to raise cold clothes. The new people studying in the Department of Sociology probably don't know this, right?</p>
<p>A month ago, Princess Elizabeth of England's wedding, because it was a time of crisis, was simplified despite being the crown prince. Unexpectedly, the son of the chairman of a Chinese province got married with such power. How could it not attract international attention!</p>
<p>China, a land full of sores, has endless strange things. I hope the newspaper is spreading rumors and joking, but judging from how vivid it is written in the newspaper, it doesn't seem like a fabrication. The wedding date was December 27th, it has been ten days, and there has been no movement from the government. If the censors don't even care about this kind of outrageous thing, what are they talking about democracy?</p>
<h3>Sound Almighty</h3>
<p>— Tian Shi</p>
<p>If "sound" is above the range of hearing, it becomes an important tool with great capabilities in science, industry, and medicine. Using "sound" to work is no longer a rare thing.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the occurrence of "sound" is due to a kind of mechanical vibration. The number of vibrations (ie, frequency) suitable for ordinary human eardrums is about 20 to 110 vibrations per second. Beyond this, it is sharp, noisy, and unbearable. The new sound transmitter can emit high-frequency sound waves of 1,200,000 vibrations per second, and these sound waves have many bizarre uses.</p>
<p>Many factories in the United States have now universally used "sound" to check for internal cracks in huge metal castings. Professor Faston of the University of Michigan discovered that if there are no cracks inside the metal casting, the sound waves can be detected and amplified by echoes after passing through. If there are cracks, the echoes at the cracks are produced faster and can be photographed on the screen to identify their location. Therefore, for important components such as propeller shafts and motor vehicle axles, this method of inspection can indeed be much more convenient.</p>
<p>Many dairy farms use sound waves to homogenize milk and sterilize it. The method is to allow the milk to flow through a steel sheet that is emitting high-frequency sound waves. Most of the bacteria are killed by the sound waves, and the larger fat particles are broken into powder, making it suitable for digestion by the stomach and intestines. Medical authorities generally believe that this kind of milk is especially suitable for infants.</p>
<p>Scientists have placed great hope on the sterilizing effect of sound waves on food. After many laboratory tests, the sterilizing effect of sound waves on food has indeed achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>There is also a type of "automatic door" produced in Kansas, USA, which is also installed using the power of sound. When entering the door, just flip a button to generate a very high-frequency sound wave, which pushes the mechanism to pull the door open, and at the same time turns on the light.</p>
<p>As for using sound to drive away fog, it has also been successfully tested, which can reduce many difficulties and dangers for aviation and navigation. The method is to emit sound waves towards the fog, and within a few seconds, the mist turns into drizzle and disappears.</p>
<p>It is reported that Soviet scientists use sound waves to help the growth of agricultural crops. According to the report, after testing, the yield of some crops has increased. Sweet potatoes germinate one week earlier, and the yield increases by about 40% to 50%. Peas also germinate earlier, and the yield even doubles. If this news is not false, then the future contributor to solving the world food shortage will be "sound."</p>
<p>There are also those who use sound waves to help wash clothes, because high-frequency sound waves pass through the clothes, bringing out all the attached dust and promoting the mixing of oil and soap. A businessman from Chicago has recently applied for a patent to manufacture a "vacuum sound wave washing machine."</p>
<p>At a carbon black factory in Texas, a special sound wave transmitter is installed inside the chimney, so that the tiny carbon particles escaping from the chimney collide with each other and fall down again. This can reduce a lot of waste. In chemical plants and mines, many people have installed this type of sound wave transmitter to reduce losses and avoid danger.</p>
<p>Since sound waves have such amazing power, if used for destruction, its horror will not be less than that of atomic bombs. Military scientists are now actively developing it into a killing weapon for use in future wars. As far as is known now, if a large number of sound waves are concentrated and emitted, it can kill people within 60 meters in 3 to 4 to 10 seconds, and even at 300 meters, it can cause serious injuries.</p>
<p>In short, "how to use sound waves" is a new topic in the scientific community. The current achievements are limited, and research work is still in its infancy. The future development still requires continued efforts from scientists around the world, as to whether it is a blessing or a curse for world civilization, it depends on the fate of mankind.</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu and Xu Shichang</h3>
<p>— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion</p>
<p>Japan manufactures various puppets to divide China, and needs to select many targets. Wang Kemin, the king of North China, is not qualified enough, only a skilled economist for temporary use. The real targets are two people, one is Wu Peifu, and the other is Xu Shichang, who both died one after another in the twenty-eighth year, victims of enemy oppression.</p>
<p>Wu Peifu has the qualifications of an idol in the minds of the northern military and political circles and the common people. He vowed not to enter the concession and lived in the Shijin Garden of Dongsi Pailou, Beijing. The headquarters of the Japanese army was located in Shizi Hutong to the north, just under the closely neighboring "low eaves". The Japanese chiefs paid attention to him at all times. A year before the incident, Wu sent a telegram to the Japanese Emperor in his personal capacity, dissuading him from aggression. Although it was of no use in fact, the Japanese Emperor (ie, Hirohito) had a deep impression of Wu's name. Therefore, he repeatedly inquired about the situation in North China. Why no Wu Peifu? At that time, the pseudo "Provisional Government" had been established for a year and a half. If it was to change from "Provisional" to "Formal," Wang Kemin and others did not have this qualification. Therefore, if old Wu agreed, the "North China Country" would be realized, and the "Wang Family Store" would inevitably withdraw and give way to Wu, just like Liang Hongzhi in Jiangnan. Although he was the head of the so-called "Renovation Government", once Wang Jingwei came out, Liang could only demote himself to a hospital director. It's all a matter of qualification.</p>
<p>Wu himself raised the banner against Duan Dang in the Gengshen Year of the Republic of China 9, condemning Duan as pro-Japanese and a traitor. By the September 18th Incident, he repeatedly sternly criticized Zhang Xueliang for "holding hundreds of thousands of soldiers and abandoning three provinces." To expect him to personally engage in "great treason" once and for all is naturally something that cannot be expected of human nature. Although old Duan was pro-Japanese in the past, after the "September 18th" incident, he was still able to avoid going to Shanghai from the Japanese Concession. When the Japanese requested him to come out, he directly told them that they must first return the three provinces! Although little Zhang lost the three provinces, he would not surrender to the enemy after all. Moreover, although old Wu was an old warlord, he also had his own rebellious nature. Under the enemy's encirclement, when talking about a new organization, he also insisted that the enemy troops completely withdraw from the country as the first condition. The Japanese took his words out of context, erased the words "condition", and really thought he agreed to a new organization, "deceiving themselves", intending to put him on stage and hold a conference to invite Wu to announce the "peace" policy. When the time came, Wu was indeed crowded out, and he taught Japan in public, talking endlessly. Those around him saw that the situation was not right, and hurriedly ordered the photographers who had been ambushing to quickly capture the whole scene. On the one hand, they took Wu backwards from the state of "his speech was not finished", and on the other hand, they told all the reporters not to record Wu's words. Later, the photos were washed out and published with a speech written by others. This bizarre drama is enough to be called "shocking". Wu was isolated from then on, and soon he heard of his illness, his tooth extraction changing, and his death. Then came the great funeral and so on. Wu ended his life in this way, never losing his toughness. If this gentleman had indeed become a puppet as expected by the enemy, there would have been a "North China Country" and Wang's "Central China" "China" standing side by side, the pseudo-flag of the pseudo-government? (ie, the Qing Bai flag with a yellow ribbon added) could never cross the Yellow River and flutter.</p>
<p>Xu Shichang lived in the British Concession in Tianjin and was a literati, so his environment was much more relaxed than Wu's. However, as a Beiyang leader and retired president, he was coveted and tested, which was beyond the ability of this 85-year-old man. Suddenly, the Japanese bandits showed their power, blockading the British and French concessions, followed by flooding. Worried and anxious, he died of illness. Although the man was old, he had been well-maintained, and if it were not for this incident, he would not have died so soon.</p>
<h3>Not Remembering Old Evils</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>"Harmony is precious" is often regarded by ordinary people as the only way to conduct oneself in the world. People always like harmony. Being able to live peacefully and calmly with the world, of course, is welcomed everywhere, and perhaps one can even "make money" because of it. In order to preserve this harmony, it is better to be hardworking and complain-free, and suffer some losses. As the saying goes, "suffering a loss is a gain." This is the idea of taking the overall situation into consideration.</p>
<p>However, it is not an easy thing to be calm in everything. This must have extremely deep cultivation. When someone is repeatedly rude and unreasonable to you, you always feel very depressed and angry, which evokes the long-accumulated embarrassment of the past, and old grudges and new hatreds burst out together. At this time, it is out of control and difficult to stop. After all, there are not many people in the world who can "dry their faces after being spat upon" or "offer the other cheek after someone slaps your left cheek." There are even fewer saints who "repay evil with virtue." Therefore, since ancient times, "not remembering old evils" has been praised as the supreme virtue.</p>
<p>However, there is a limit to not remembering old evils, and one should also look at the other party's attitude. It does not mean throwing all the previous humiliations to the winds, thinking that this is magnanimity and outstanding demeanor. In this world, one cannot erase everything and regard everyone as an unpredictable and ungrateful fellow, but if one regards everyone as a kind-hearted and compassionate good person, then one will not be able to stand and will be eliminated by the times in the competition for survival. This does not mean that we should only use the means of petty people to deal with others, but that for the sake of self-defense, we have to think from the worst. "Raising a tiger is a worry," and the matter of venomous snakes biting back is everywhere. What's more, the so-called not remembering old evils means encouraging others to correct their mistakes and return to the right path. "Laying down the butcher knife" may "become a Buddha on the spot", but if the other party has not laid down the butcher knife, you rashly abandon your prejudices and do not remember old evils, the result will definitely be the other party's taking an inch.</p>
<p>However, the most terrible thing is not simply not remembering old evils, but completely forgetting the losses and tricks one has suffered in the past. It is not a magnanimous demeanor, but forgetfulness and confusion. One hundred or ten years can be said to be a very short period in history, but a forgetful person will throw yesterday's lessons completely clean, and a confused person will put his second hand into the fire after his first hand has been burned! If this forgetful and confused old gentleman still does not take his forgetfulness and confusion seriously, and even boasts of the greatness of this forgetful spirit, then this gentleman, to use a Shanghai dialect, is truly "crooked" beyond redemption.</p>
<h3>Drinking Habit</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>A common saying goes, "It is easier to change mountains and rivers than a person's nature." This means that a person's habits stem from their innate character and are difficult to change. Indeed, this is often the case. As long as someone is human and not a god, they will likely have some inherent habits. Whether these habits are good or bad is a matter of personal opinion, without a definitive standard. What one person deems unacceptable, another might see as one of life's great pleasures. After all, "those who walk different paths cannot make plans together." Even scientists acknowledge that there is no absolute truth in the world, so how much more so when it comes to individual habits? For instance, a fondness for alcohol is a prime example. Let's discuss the drinking habit.</p>
<p>In China, wine has always been inextricably linked to scholars. Using a cup of wine to dispel the frustration in one's heart is a time-honored method for scholars to express their grievances. Although "drinking to drown sorrow only makes sorrow deeper," and one might end up rambling nonsensically after getting drunk or simply falling asleep, it can still be an effective way to temporarily numb oneself. Moreover, everyone knows that alcohol is a stimulant. It can sometimes enhance one's inspiration and stimulate creativity. Therefore, many scholars in ancient times were particularly fond of wine.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "Li Bai could write a hundred poems after drinking a斗 of wine." Li Bai's literary talent, described as "writing a thousand pieces in a flash, ready to go while leaning on a horse," greatly benefited from wine. Later scholars who possessed both literary talent and a similar fondness for alcohol as Li Bai were often praised as "banished immortals."</p>
<p>Naturally, losing composure after drinking and revealing one's true self is unavoidable for those who enjoy alcohol. As someone put it, "Stumbling around drunk is different from being sober, the drug compels one to be unfree." This can be considered a profound observation. As for using alcohol to insult others, that is another matter. In today's world, with soaring prices and demanding lives, those who can still afford "three cups in hand" are probably few and far between. One wonders how the general wine-loving scholars are spending their sober days!</p>
<h3>"Seppuku" in China</h3>
<p>— Tian Gong</p>
<p>The young man Zhang Dequan, who had struggled as a supervisor on various railway lines in the interior during the war against Japan, now "cut open his abdomen with a sharp blade, with fresh blood spurting to the roof, and then poured it all over his body," leaving a suicide note "requesting to be buried in the name of a civil servant of the Railway Management Committee." (As reported in the January 9th Taiwan Dispatch of the Shenbao)</p>
<p>In this piece of news, two points are noteworthy: the cruelty of his method of death and the poignancy of his request. Seppuku (ritual suicide by disembowelment) is rarely seen in our country and is considered somewhat bizarre. I only know that among the traditional Japanese methods of suicide, there is such a thing as seppuku, but it is a manifestation of the so-called Bushido, where they always believe that it is better to die by seppuku than to suffer humiliation, or that it is better to die by a quick and decisive seppuku than to suffer after being captured. However, today, when this traditional spirit of seppuku is no longer popular in Japan, why does it appear on a Chinese civil servant in Taiwan, which had been under Japanese rule for fifty years? And why does it appear in the administrative organs of Taiwan today, two years after its recovery? In addition to receiving materials and winning hearts, should we also receive Japanese-style seppuku? Although the cruel Japanese soldiers are laughably old-fashioned, they have gradually shed the old burden of seppuku they had been carrying for five hundred years and have clearly adopted a spirit of only allowing killing but not suicide. One can understand this by looking at how Japan still harbors the intention of making a comeback after being defeated this time. This is something that anyone should be wary of. I remember that some Japanese ambitious once said arrogantly: "Rather than being defeated by China, we would rather attack a strong enemy like Russia and perish in a truly first-class showdown." This is naturally a hypocritical and arrogant prediction, not worth mentioning, but looking at this sentence today, it does make people feel that the Japanese have this kind of psychological demand and factual manifestation. From another perspective, we should be even more vigilant that the Japanese may one day come to China again to carry out intentional or unintentional suicide, just like the Sino-Japanese War that has already ended. The petty Japanese, the mentality of "revenge" is something we cannot but guard against. At that time, their ambitions may not only be expressed in the form of personal seppuku, but also in the form of national seppuku.</p>
<p>It is a pity that this young civil servant could not see this. He only realized that "the salary is meager and cannot support his wife and children," and he was only humiliated by "his wife's upcoming remarriage." Since he could seek death, why could he not seek survival with the spirit of seeking death? Why could he not seek the development of his career with the spirit of seeking death? Why only ask to be buried in the name of a civil servant and not make further efforts to give himself a state funeral or other more respectable funeral? Alas, this is why this seppuku tragedy is a tragedy!</p>
<h3>Work-Study</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Students always feel that this semester is passing too slowly, having to study so many books without a break. But what about the parents? Needless to say, the approaching end of the year is a major concern for them, and the end of another semester only adds to their worries.</p>
<p>Originally, whether they are civil servants or small clerks, they already feel breathless from trying to keep up with the rising prices. Adding such a heavy burden—their children's tuition fees—ordinary parents collapse, and their children drop out of school.</p>
<p>Only students who have dropped out of school will truly appreciate the value of education. Since they lack the means to pursue their studies, and the chances of getting a scholarship are slim due to the large number of applicants, what about finding a job? The job market is already saturated, so how easy is that? They truly feel like they have "no way to go to heaven and no door to enter into the earth!" After much thought, God did not create a batch of "idle" people, unless they themselves are willing to be so, otherwise "heaven never seals off all exits." If this road is blocked, there are other ways to survive.</p>
<p>Then, "work-study" can be considered a last resort. Fortunately, this method is not without precedent. Many famous professors in universities and many famous scholars and great entrepreneurs in society all adopted the "work-study" method when they studied abroad. Looking back at China, this method is not necessarily unfeasible. Didn't the International Hotel recruit university students to work as waiters a few years ago? Moreover, the cost of living a few years ago was not as high as it is today, yet many students still applied. Therefore, a recent advertisement by a shoe store for university students to work as shop assistants indicates that society needs students, as long as the students are willing to lower themselves!</p>
<p>However, it must be said that putting it into practice is very difficult after all. Time is the biggest problem. Other than summer and winter vacations, today's students do not have much free time to spare. Watching movies and going to dance halls are just the pastimes of wealthy children! If "work-study" is implemented, it can only be limited to holidays, and they are willing to do even the lowest-paying jobs.</p>
<p>Students are originally those who "learn" about "life". Labor is sacred. Using it to enrich life experience, being self-reliant, and understanding the difficulty of parents earning money are all deeply meaningful, achieving multiple goals in one fell swoop. Why not promote it?</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (40)</p>
<p>Qiwan rushed back to Beiping just in time for the day before the funeral, and stayed overnight at home. Zhuzhai, having learned the news of Qiwan's return to Beiping, had come to the school several times to inquire of Aunt Wang every day, and sent an extremely elaborate wreath to the Gu residence. This day, after receiving a report from Aunt Wang that Qiwan had arrived, he rushed to see her, but Qiwan was not at home. According to Aunt Wang, "After the boss came back, she cried twice, and once fainted next to the coffin. She is now staying overnight at the mourning hall at number twelve across the street. The old master will be buried tomorrow, and there are many female guests there. Even if I tell her, she can't come back." Zhuzhai thought that this was true. Wanting to go over to see her, Qiwan was in mourning and could not talk to him much, so he had to instruct Aunt Wang to call him as soon as the boss returned, so that he could rush over immediately. The next day was the day of Qiwan's father's funeral procession. Zhuzhai could not participate in carrying the coffin, so he waited on the route that the coffin was sure to pass through at Caishikou. When the coffin was about to arrive, the sidewalks were already crowded with people who had come to watch, not for the sake of the famous actor's funeral, but to see the famous people of the Peking Opera world and their families, etc., who were escorting the coffin, all with a curious eye, wanting to take this opportunity to catch a glimpse of everyone's true face. As a result, as the coffin passed by, the mourning curtain was raised high, and the white cloth surrounding it was tightly wrapped, so that the faces of the sons and daughters in mourning inside the curtain could not be seen at all, only revealing many feet, all wearing white mourning shoes. Zhuzhai squeezed into the crowd, straining his eyes to identify them, but could not make out which pair belonged to Qiwan. After the funeral procession, everyone went back to their tents. It was not until about five o'clock in the afternoon that he received a call from Qiwan saying: "I am too busy today, and only have two hours to talk. Please come to see me, I'm afraid I won't have time later." Zhuzhai hurriedly rushed to Xiaochang Hutong, only to see Qiwan dressed in plain white, white clothes, white shoes, white socks, her face free of any makeup, as white as solidified fat, her eyebrows lightly brushed, set off by the deep dimples on her cheeks, with an elegant simplicity that had a special charm. When Zhuzhai pushed the door open, she was holding her beloved cat Mimi in her arms, pouting her small mouth, as if complaining that Aunt Wang had not fed it well. She looked up and saw Zhuzhai come in, immediately put her beloved cat gently on the ground, and the cat leaped at Zhuzhai's feet, circling around, raising its tail, meowing. Qiwan, leaving Mimi aside, put both hands on Zhuzhai's shoulders, her face showing a mixture of joy and sorrow, and said: "Zhu, I'm back! My father..." At this point, her voice caught in her throat. Zhuzhai was about to comfort her when he heard her say again: "Have our affairs been taken care of?" Zhuzhai couldn't help but feel a jolt in his heart, and couldn't answer for a moment. Qiwan seemed to know what he meant, and said again: "It's just a matter of time, right? When my father was alive, I never listened to him, and he loved me the most, and he was most concerned about my affairs, both big and small, he wanted to take care of everything. Now it is impossible to ask my father for instructions. My family is about to become another world, and no one cares about my marriage anymore. As for how long it takes, I don't think it matters much, I will always wait for you. I only have three days in Beiping this time. I have been busy with my father's funeral for two whole days. Tomorrow, for family matters, I will have to spend most of the day again. Besides, I have to go to the temple with my family to pay tribute to my father. I have to leave early the day after tomorrow. I don't have much time to talk to you. In short, I will wait for you no matter what."</p>

<h3>Grandfather, Father, and Grandson with Only One Son The Uncle and Nephew Contend for Inheritance</h3>
<p>Sun Lin asks: My father had three brothers, Jia, Yi, and Bing. Jia was my father, who had two sons, myself being the younger. Yi and Bing each had one son. Now the father and uncle generations have all passed away one after another. Bing's son has also passed away. My elder brother has no sons, Yi's son only has one daughter, and I have one son, just three years old. Last year, we revised the family genealogy. Yi's son wants his daughter to inherit Bing's son's property. I ask: When Bing's son passed away, my son personally handled the encoffining and burial, and followed the prescribed mourning rituals. Can he inherit Bing's son's property? Bing's son passed away unmarried at the age of twenty-one. Does his nephew have the right to inherit? Bing's son died unmarried, should Bing's property be inherited by the younger son of the Jia line? Does Bing's wife have the right to choose someone to inherit?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] The current law no longer has ancestral inheritance. Bing's son died after the implementation of the inheritance chapter of the current Civil Code. For posthumous adoption, nephew inheritance, regardless of gender, is not effective, and cannot have the right to inherit Bing's son's property. Bing's wife has the right to choose someone to be her own adopted son to inherit her own property rights, but this person may not be Bing's deceased adopted son or daughter.</p>
<h3>Reader's Mailbox</h3>
<p>Zhu Xianggen Jun Jian: There are two ways to get a divorce: one is by mutual consent, which should be done in writing and with the signatures of two or more witnesses; the other is by court judgment, where one party to the marriage may petition the court for divorce if the other party has one of the circumstances listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code. A unilateral declaration in the newspaper is invalid. As stated in your letter, you can petition the court for a divorce based on Article 1052, paragraph 5 of the Civil Code, "where one party to the marriage abandons the other party in bad faith in a continuing state."</p>
