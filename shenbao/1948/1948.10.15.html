<p>匪在上月發動所謂秋季攻勢，以魯中·遼西為主戰塲，冀·察，綏·晋·陝·豫為支戰塲，企圖隔斷我東北與華北的連絡，及破壞我華北華中各重要職略據點之間的將通，而貫通其東北·華北·西北·華中匪之連繫，首攻濟南，繼襲遼西，破壤北寗·平綏各路，威脅歸綏·張垣·大同·太原，流竄關中，企圖破壤隴海及平漢·津浦南段鐵路，實行攻堅會戰，並宣傳在軍事方面得手後，卽進行召開所謂新政協，準備成立偽政府，以擴大其叛亂的陰謀。</p>
<p>國軍為粉碎匪之陰謀，殲滅匪軍主力，在各戰塲逐漸採取主動出擊，集中兵力，一面在主戰場予林彪陳毅兩匪部以嚴重打繫，一面在支戰塲對聶榮臻·賀龍·徐向前·彭德懷·劉伯承·陳賡諸匪部迎頭痛繫，東北長藩國軍强有力的出繫，頓使遼北遼西戰塲改觀。察綏·晋陝國軍的反攻，使匪疲於奔命，蒙受重大損失。尤其是陝東大捷使整備補半年的彭德懷匪部，幾乎又蹈隴東覆轍，潰滅三分之一。至華中華東陳劉二匪雖均集中力量，準備攻勢防禦，但國軍正節節向匪進迫，國軍在各戰塲已充分取得主動，而匪則兵力分散，漸陷被動。目前國軍剿匪方略，在鞏固華中，保障東北與華北之交通，集中力量，找匪主力決戰，不重一城一市之得失。綜觀各戰塲形勢在秋季作戰中，國軍顯已逐漸取得轉守為攻轉敗為勝之有利的地位。</p>
<p>乙·各戰塲形勢</p>
<p>（一）東北戰塲：週來國軍已採取有力新行動，長春守軍正向外國出擊，匪部均紛紛後撤，我空投糧食及彈藥，已不再受匪砲之阻擾。我潘陽强大兵團，大舉西向進擊，當於十一日下午四時將彰武克復，匪第五縱隊及蒙匪負創潰逃，連日仍在彰武西南激戰；另路國軍於十二日上午攻克新民西南之撓陽河，刻正向新立屯打虎山進攻中。我由葫產島北進之有力兵團，亦於十日起開始向匪攻擊，十二日上午進駐錦西東北之塔山，匪第四縱隊之十一·十二·兩師向東潰退。匪見我各路大軍進展神速，乃集中力量，對我錦州加緊侵犯，戰事曾一度接近城郊，我錦州守軍十一日晚在空砲密切配合下，對犯匪展開猛烈出擊，十二日指曉收復北大營，匪第八縱隊向東潰退。另路向錦南進攻部隊，十二日晨一度攻克劉家屯·匪增援反撲，刻仍在激戰中。至於奪西北兩面之匪，經國軍猛烈進擊後殲滅匪軍三從隊的一個師，我傷亡團長各一員，匪刻已由亮馬山，石橋子（錦州北）一帶敗退。此方面國軍正展開有利反攻形勢，兩錦決戰業已進行數日，勝負不久卽可決定。</p>
<p>（二）華北戰塲：因聶匪在綏南察南的蠢動，均被我軍壓制，故本週內戰事已逐漸東移，匪三·四縱隊主力及二縱隊一部，以及獨七師，獨八師，獨一旅等匪部，流竄在長城內外康莊，居庸關一帶，昌平國軍於七日向外圍出擊後，經四日來的反復激戰，終於在十二日晨將犯匪擊退。另股犯新保安車站之匪，亦被我軍迎頭痛擊，於十二日晨向北潰逃，四縱隊一部則向西南潰退。</p>
<p>太原方面戰爭，週內亦趨劇烈，城南三十華里武宿機塲週邊之辛營，高中等村，城東南迤北約二十華里之石咀子，在西竄城東北三十華里之風閣梁等地，均有激烈之爭奪戰，自十一日中午起，匪第二十二·三十九等旅，續向辛營，高中等村及武宿西南隅碉堡進犯，皆被我軍奮勇擊退，一部突入武宿村內之匪，被國軍全數殲滅。上述地點，戰事仍在繼續進行中。</p>
<p>（三）西北戰塲：自彭德懷匪部，在涇渭河谷慘敗後，卽竄往黃龍山區喘息整補，近得晋南匪軍之助，又復糾集其二·三·四·六等四個縱隊南犯，國軍此次誘匪離開黃龍山區後，因事先預作之部署嚴密，俟匪竄抵平民·朝邑·大荔（均郃陽澄城東南），當卽開始全綫猛攻，犯大荔之匪，自十一日起在大好營·東西漢村·胭脂山等地，經我軍痛殲，迄十三日中午，匪二·三·四·六等縱隊，斃傷近三分之一，狼狽北竄，在大好營，漢村附近，遺屍達七千餘具，我追擊部隊，已抵雙泉鎭東西之綫，正加緊向逃匪追剿中。彭匪經半年長期整補之實力，至此乃又遭受我慘重之打擊。</p>
<p>（四）其他豫西鄂北方面：劉伯承·陳賡匪部，迄猶徘徊平漢路西側，未敢大舉蠢動，國軍正向平漢路西南地區展開掃蕩戰，空軍亦在該地區作不斷的偵炸。至魯西南方面，因國軍續向北壓迫，陳毅匪部正陸續向南增調，集中兵力於濟寗·兗州·及魯南一帶，企圖頑抗。此方面近週無大戰鬥。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>生產原料的分配問題</h3>
<p>一般人現在都很注意到生產如何增加，生產如何維持了。這是一種進步！因為只知限價，而遺忘生產，是很危險的。要生產，就不能無原料，於是大家又注意到原料的來源問題，可是很少注意到原料的分配間題。上海區物資調節委員會最近曾決議：除棉花，燃料，及輸入原料之分配，均有專管機關外，其餘尚無分配機關之原料，擬由工業會擬定辦法，送會核轉督導處核准施行。照此推測，將來分配原料之途徑，當不外下列兩種：（一）物資之專管機關，如中信局等；（二）工業會或其所屬之各業公會。過去分配物資，大抵係照上項途徑辦理，以後率由舊章，自不難收駕輕就熟之效。惟同業分配，其範園常限於同業（卽參加公會之會員），卽專管機關之分配物資，亦往往以是否會員，或曾否領有執照或登記證為必要之條件，其較為嚴格者，並須視其規模之大小而酌定等第。於是下列三種工廠，常事不到分配的權利：（一）小型工廠，（二）手工業；（三）未准入會之新同業。照現行法，不論其為商業或工業，本有强制入會的規定，嚴格言之，是公會以外無同業，凡屬同業當然皆是會員，但新工業同業公會法限制更嚴，自有一類規模較小之工廠，以動力戚所雇工人不足法定數目之故而不許其入會，又以實施配給之故，確有少數公會，故設禁例，或多方留難，使新設工廠無從取得會員之資格，其抱向隅之小型工廠，以三千錠以下之紗廠為最著。其他尚有各種生產合作社，以組織較異，向不加入同業公會，當然亦竟無從參加分配；這尤與政府倡導合作事業之民生主義經濟政策相遠背。</p>
<p>以上各類工業，以範圍較小，生產力較為薄弱，如單從增加生產這觀點而論，其關係自較輕微。然而單位衆多，總計起來，其數目亦殊可觀。且以設備較差之故，其雇用的人手，却比大工廠相對地增多，故就維持就業這一點而論，其嚴重性亦殊不容忽視。為避免失業，襲勵生產起見，在分配原料的時候，我們希望顯到這些小規模的工業，使他們利益均沾，以免影響到整個的社會經濟。</p>
<p>合作社的提倡，原是國家旣定的決策，它在物資分配這一點上，依法應有優先的權利；其已入會之小型工廠，與已開工之新設工廠，同屬生產事業，也沒有加以歧視的理由。所盛爲問題的，就是法定條件不具備之工廠，與尚無組織之手工業，不能不設法使他們分別團結起來，以便担荷這一項分配的工作。因為團體是承上啓下的樞紐，一切申請，承領，和支配的任務，不能不靠這個樞紐來經辦。倘使過於散漫，照現在那樣情形，縱使物資機關一視同仁，有意成全，亦要感覺到愛莫能助，更談不到集團採購，自己去解決原料問題了。</p>
<p>手工業卽是一般工塲或家庭工業，如沒有適當的法定團體可以組織，最好指導他們組織生產合作社，以期易於集事。至於法定條件不具備之小工廠，旣不許加入工業公會，便應另籌辦法，准予團結互助，以資補救。我們意見，原料的來源與分配問題，同樣重要。倘使有一部分生產機構因無法獲得分配的原料，而陷於停頓狀態，則就算原料有了來源而本問題仍沒有完全解決。</p>
<h3>張厲生堅守防綫　對議價決不考慮　謂黑市只有取締一議必無止境</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕張厲生今論議價問題稱：政府決不考慮議價二字，所謂議者，不啻與虎謀皮，必致議無止境，八一九後的進貨，商人如提出確實理由，必要時政府當按其成本予以核定，而非議也，且不應因有黑市而議價，有黑市只有取締之一途，此為余之中心信念，必準此而力行，成功是應當的，不成功應由大家負責，人民皆應有此信念。張氏認為普配日用必需品乃抑制物價之良法。</p>

<h3>監委郝遇林函張厲生　指責限價主合理調整</h3>

<h3>柏林問題會外妥協絕望　安理會今恢復辯論　蘇方答覆未能使三強滿意</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十四日電〕聯合國安理會十四日開會討論巴勒斯坦問題，然柏林辯論仍為一切問題之中心。安理會十五日計劃恢復柏林辯論，美代表傑賓普：英代表賣德幹及法代表巴洛迪今晨舉行新談話，俾草成方針，早日譴責蘇聯為侵略者及和平之威脅。據傳三人正在起草一動議案，於安理會恢復辯論柏林時提出。蘇代表維辛斯基必將否決西方之動議。西方若不得志於安理會，勢必將蘇聯「受審」之法庭移入聯大，通過西方提案為建議案，蘇聯在大會中無否決權，當不能重使故技。維氏十三日堅持在以談判求取協議前，柏林危機一項應自安理會議程上取消，西方當予拒絕。週來奔走折衝之阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞十四日再與維辛斯基及西方三代表談話，其助理稱，勃氏已認為無望避免安理會中擬牌表決，又暗示阿國屆時可能投棄權票。西方三强代表將於今晚再度會議，以計劃未來之行徑，同時安理會六中立委員亦曾舉行會議，考慮三强對贊成聯合決議譴責蘇聯之壓力。一般預料阿外長勃拉馬格里亞將於十五日揭開恢復辯論柏林問題之序幕，報吿調解經過並公佈其致兩造之建議及答覆。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎十三日合衆電〕蘇聯今要求將柏林案件自安理會撤回，作為解決柏林危機之第一步，由是關閉早日解決柏林危機之門戶。上述要求乃蘇聯對安理會主席勃拉馬拉里亞提交蘇代表維辛斯基折衷建議之答覆。據接近三强之人士稱，蘇聯之答覆不能使人滿意。勃氏已召集安理會於十五日開會，恢復柏林危機之討論。勃氏今日曾訪維辛斯基，商談一小時，聰取蘇聯對調解努力之反響。勃氏之調解努力，係以同時取消柏林封鎖及召開四外長會議討論整個德國問題為基礎。經常保持柏林談判聯繫之三强，則認為蘇聯之答覆包括下列各項令人不滿之條件：（一）將柏林案件撤出安理會議程之條件，三强決不同意。（二）東西雙方回復八月三十日之情勢。四强在莫斯　同意一併討論封鎖及幣制方案，但談判移至柏林後，蘇聯卽忽視上項方案。</p>
<h3>安理會討論聖地問題　廳取彭契報告　調解專員貝那特被暗殺事件　中英法英求以色列作詳盡解釋</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十四日電〕聯合國安理會十四日開會討論巴勒斯坦問題，英國發言人稱，美英兩國皆支持故貝那多特致聯合國之報吿，認為此乃解決聖地戰爭之最佳基本辦法。蘇聯，烏克蘭及叙利亞三國企圖使安理會延宕考慮阿猶雙方對聖地停戰協定之遠反事件已吿失敗。安理會結果以八票對零票，三票棄權，決議採納議程，及繼續聰取代理調解專員彭契之報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十四日廣播：代理聖地調解專員彭契籲請安理會對貝那多特被暗殺一案採取行動，中，英，法三國代表均予支持，提出決議案，要求以色列政府提供暗殺案之完全報吿，並要求以色列及阿拉伯政府給予聯合國代表以自由通行及安全之保蹬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十四日廣播；彭契指責貝那多特之被暗殺，由於猶太政府之疏忽所致，促請安理會要求以色列政府作詳盡之解釋。</p>
<p>彭氏提出抗議，調渠迄未收到以色列政府關於拘捕史端恩黨之正式報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十四日廣播：聯合國以色列代表伊本在安理會中稱，以色列政府當竭力裁定暗殺貝那多特之兇犯並報吿聯合國。伊氏謂以色列政府已對二大猶太團體史端恩黨及伊爾根黨採取强硬行動，並予以解散。伊氏復稱，聯合國觀察人員茍欲獲得自由通行及適當之保護，則其在阿拉伯境內及猶太境內應平等分佈</p>
<p>安理會於下午五時三十分休會，以使代表得有充分時間研究英國所提之決議案，下次開會時期尚未決定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫教十四日廣播：英美政府為加緊對蘇佔區之反封鎖，頃頒佈命令，凡自英·美佔區運往蘇佔區之貨物未備裝貨憑單者，均予沒收。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十四日電〕蘇陸軍機關報「每日評論報」十四日重申蘇聯之建議稱，蘇聯對柏林之封鎖將予撤除，若西方國家所發行之馬克自柏林撤退。該報又為蘇聯辯論稱，由於德境西方區之幣制改革之後，為保護東德避免經濟陰謀，對鎖乃必要者。該報之社評稱，西方馬克撤退之日，卽交通管制撤消之時。</p>
<h3>日參眾兩院漏夜選舉　吉田藏膺選閣揆　廢票二百餘張新閣恐難持久</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十四日電〕日參議院十四日下午七時四十分舉行全體會議，投票選舉後繼首揆，八時零三分散會，選舉結果吉田茂以一四四票之絕對多數當選。其他得票者計片山哲二九票，黑田壽男一五票，松平恒雄九票，三木武夫六票。又衆議院於九時四十四分舉行全體會議，迄發稿時止。尚在討論山崎辭職問題。後繼首揆之選舉結果，恐須至午夜始能揭曉。</p>

<h3>蘇聨野心漫無止境　貝文要求攤牌　在倫敦發表警闢演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆赴倫敦十四日電〕英外相貝文十四日要求蘇聯宣佈其「野心之範圍」。貝文發表自聯大會歸來後之首次演說稱，渠所欲解決之問題，厥為「吾人是否能並存於世？彼等希望居住於何區？其野心有無止境？蘇聯人乃擴張主義論者，彼等乃帝國主義論者之最後一批勢力，其程度與沙皇不相上下。吾人並不控制任何人，吾人接受宗敎膚色及地位之平等觀念。在吾人控制之地區，吾人為自治及獨立而盡力。吾人並不企求推翻彼等之政制，然吾人決以一切，阻其摧殘吾人之自由」。</p>

<h3>生意太好　同聲叫苦　包飯作拒絕承包　酒菜館申請停業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自當局嚴格規定憑證購買日用物品後，無形中使一般市民購求受到限制，减但浪費不少。惟另一方面，各酒菜館及包飯作則因限購政策而大感苦惱。據最近酒菜館業統計報吿，現普通人口較少之家庭，每日以蔬菜難買，紛紛向包飯作包飯，或闔家赴飯館吃限價客飯，供應客飯消費最大者為油米兩項，而該業目前購進油米，全賴戶籍證，此外尚有社會局核配之每店每月麵粉一百七十磅，平均各店一月配得數量往往不敷旬日零售，其中包飯作因存底有限，近已向客戶拒絕承包，酒菜館亦有多家向公會申請暫行歇業。該業公會表示為欲使全體渡過目前難關，除卽日趕辦各會員每月油·蔬菜·魚肉鷄等等實際售出數量統計，彙轉社會局請設法統籌撥配外，並決向社局請領採辦證，由該業直接赴外埠產米區採辦食米，藉使門市客飯供應繼續維持。</p>
<h3>珠鑽翠玉　高品絕跡　平均價漲逾一倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據珠玉業中人談：該業營業，年常至夏曆八九月時為一高汎，因是時市面喜慶之事增多，對珠鑽等珍貴飾物之需要亦轉殷，本年益以當局收兌金鈔所溢出之游資，亦有部份趨向搜購珠鑽一途，致市面上珠鑽翠玉之高擋貨，竟吿絕跡，而同業中平日頓以週轉買賣者，均屬中下檔貨。據稱：高擋貨均為收藏家搜集珍藏，卽偶有流出，有資購入者亦必視同拱　，納而不再出矣。現同業中交易之貨，以眞珠，鑽石，翡翠三種為大宗，平均價格，約較入一九時漲起一倍有餘。據謂：平津價格較滬更貴一倍。記者昨趨訪侯家路珠玉市塲，塲中依然熱鬧異常，交易似頗鼎盛。惟據業中人談：實際交易額，僅及八一九時之七成而已。同業會員共有一百餘人。全國從事珠玉業者，包括平津漢穗新疆等地，約在二百萬人之譜。最近當局有停止珠鑽等奢侈飾物買賣之說，該業以珠鑽一項，國產亦多，經營此業者，多有悠久歷史，似未能與禁止舶來奢侈品之買賣，列為一類，故已去呈聲請仍予維持營業云。</p>

<p>張人佑　代詞</p>
<p>（一）關於被控隱匿證據部份：宋仁德被陶企雲及丁朱氏敎唆砍傷，係根據該局司法股長簽具意見，准將陶·丁二人保釋，並經呈報總局核示繼續調查，有案可稽，對被控「不予追究，亦不移送法院」，謂為失實。（二）關於被吿凟職及談文喜等美金交易部份：謂被吿自到任以來，卽奉命澈底整頓沿江碼頭，自白渡橋至十六舖一帶，深恐妨碍國際觀瞻，當局尤為注意；時有百樂汽車行，在外灘第十號碼頭經營美軍出差汽車業務，私建木亭，係違章建築，由該局巡官羅兆强簽擬取締，該局第一股長沈煥領以該行負責人熊度不佳，並擬拘留二日示敝，後因總局外事科徐科長以電話通知，百樂木亭係為美軍所用，不必嚴予追究，乃予申斥了事。羅巡官簽呈中，並未提及該行以美金交易事。後查出美軍以代價劵在指定之出入塲所，如美軍俱樂部，餐廳，游泳池等處通用。（當庭呈上徐科長證明書及美金代價劵。）</p>
<p>運槍帆船　查無嫌欵</p>

<p>賽球售物　籌款修屋</p>
<p>（六）關於被吿與謝翼雲詐取財物部份：謂曹餘生部份竊盜德士古柴油，係股員謝翼雲承辦，據渠所知，謝為人小心謹愼，刻苦老練，無受賄事寶。（七）關於黃伯謙盜賣公有財物，對於非主管事務圖利及公物上侵占部份：謂渠於到任之初，以局所房屋破露，而經費短絀，乃由義警舉行球賽籌款，以充修茸局舍不敷之款。在一次局務會報中，嚴副局長，黃總務股長均出席，議定將局外之無主鐵錨，亂鐵絲及舊磁浴盆出售籌付。出售贓煤事不知，後查悉為茶房阿三盜用股長名義所為，當予開革。張供畢，並稱：此次被控，完全係遭人嫉妒，挾嫌誣吿。庭上以開審時間已久，令各被吿就座。須由其餘八被吿相繼應訊。</p>
<p>槍照照片　呈請參考</p>
<p>黃伯謙供：局內燃料報銷，領用，均由股員陳紹錫負責，事前不知八號汽艇撞毀，否認偽報油量；出售磁盆鐵錨等物，係局務會報決定，籌付修葺局舍補充費之用。夏哲民供：經查船戶周岱靑之槍彈，與蘭秀鄉公所證明書相符，因無私運嫌疑，故予保釋，是日副局長不在局內，乃逕呈張局長核准。秦樹明供：與夏哲民不相識，否認行賄。周岱靑供：渠之帆船係由福州開出，經崇明而抵吳淞。，所藏槍彈，為防匪之用，因槍照過期，乃暫由蘭秀鄉公所出給證明，同時向內政部請領執照，現已發下。供訖，渠之辯護律師呈上新槍照照片，供庭上參考。談文喜供：為百樂汽車行股東，行務有經理，副經理負責。梁金浩供：任百樂副經理，在外灘所建木亭，係便利美國海軍出入之用，收受美金代價劵，所兌取者仍為法幣，木事被書局取締時，未託人說情。最後由羅兆强及謝翼雲答供，均否認有藉權收賄情事。庭上以案情大致已見端倪，乃論改期，下次並傳證人到庭應訊。</p>

<h3>京蘇行腳</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>春秋兩季，是屬於蘇杭的。杭州我不大熟悉，以蘇州論，倒怕有小半的繁榮仰賴着王孫公子的乘興一遊。我們在蘇州住久了的人，都感到這裏是個古老而沒落的城市，深巷中寂無行人，老婆婆們在凄冷的絡絲或躬了背繍花，這是一輻十八世紀的耕織圖，上海固不必提，卽其西隣的無錫，恐怕也少見罷？而那點綴在闆巷中的祠堂。養莊，荒廢了的園亭，更給人以無限歷史的悲痛。我是北平人，無論怎樣也感到他與舊京有幾分相似之處，這些卸了責任的大城市正向墳墓裏走，而我們的出身與境遇，時時會對着這夕陽晚照發兩聲嘆惜，又無可奈何，所以，我連虎邱和靈巖也不敢去，怕會引起更深更重的幻滅。</p>
<p>雖然是這樣，觀前街的店舖也被搶買空了，我曾走遍幾家洋貨店都買不着一盒好的牙膏。肉也經常沒有。蘇州人安分守己，不見得全要囤積，而且也沒那麼些閒錢，顯然是上海來的什麼牛之類在變把戲，加上旅行的闊人們乘機湊熱鬧，連采芝齋的架子都空了，要想買些白糖梅子全沒辦法。正經商人對此並不是歡樂而在危懼，前一個星期，就把幾個大金店擴得「暫停營業」，他們生怕也步了後塵。最妙是我離開蘇州那天，屆車到車站，跑了一條臨頓路，一個也不肯去。我心想，莫非勞力也要囤積起來嗎？後來詳詢所以，才知道因爲車站秩序欠佳，特別是那些作掮客的，自己攪了客人然後轉薦給其他車夫，從中取回佣，使客人受盡了欺騙，於是車站在四週加了木攔，不許空車進欄，也不許空車出攔，這樣車夫就不肯去車站，唯恐攬不到客人被扣留。蘇州車站的車夫是著名兇惡的，可是這麼一來，連一輛車也沒有，旅客豈不是更不方便？不知這兩天改善了沒有。</p>
<p>火車只有對號比較鬆些，其餘各次，統被單帮客人佔滿。單帮客並不是不願買對號票，而是怕車上的突擊檢查。看社會經濟的動態，單帮客亦一大徵象，若有人發願寫一本中國走私史，一定有若干很好玩的章節，可以益人智慧。而今日各種資料的保留與流傳，也是應當特別注意的，因此我把申報的黃牛黨軋西藥的照片，都很小心的剪貼在我的照片簿上了。</p>
<p>南京給我們第一個威脅也是「車」，下火車不過晚八點，江南公司的汽車已準備進廠，不載客人了。賣票處貼着「車輛稀少，請勿等候」的標語，這比「電影院今日客滿明日請早」的吿白對我們的威脅大多了。首都公司還有兩部車，可是擁在那兒要上車的至少有四五百人，我趕快找野鷄小汽車，每人一圓，亳無商量之餘地，只好擠將上去，作一個沙丁魚。每車必須裝七位客人，連開車及跟車共九人，說是黃魚，何如說是沙丁魚呢。這還不算竹槓，到新街口下車一雇黃包車，半個月以前不過一角的路程如今是起碼三角，有的就討五角。我拎着旅行袋走了十幾分鐘，好容易化七十萬法幣雇妥一輛，我和他說：「怎麼車子漲得這般凶？七十萬要一升多米呀，從前可以到下關了！」「先生，米便宜，不能說米了！」我們當公務員的聽了這種話眞不知是什麼滋味，別人是米貴時便論米，米賤了又論錢，唯有公敎人員，永遠以最低的標凖來計值，對於一個月不滿一百元月薪的生活，此刻是眞够人安排的！</p>
<h3>雲深處近句</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>大醒法師之奉化住持雪寶寺索詩</p>
<p>四明別峰尊雪寶，寶剎千年馳名舊，前躅常通與明覺，有宋以來誰卓遽。太虛上人今　宗，聽經時復興蟄龍，海內弟子幾何人？於中開士殊淸醇，飛錫忽去　東天，住寂方將　萬綠，獨念雲間老居土，相約入山看山水。居士苦求無　心，九年一醉還沉吟，正悲世上我相多，欲叩丈人奈若何？</p>
<h3>快人快事</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>有許多人在聽名人演說或看戲時，偏喜歡咳嗽或者「縮鼻涕」，有時舞台上塲面稍「冷」，那些觀衆簡直像在開傷風競賽大會，把緊張嚴肅的氣氛破壤得乾乾凈凈，眞呌人啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>可是，英國名將蒙哥駡利元帥却有一套萬試萬靈的妙法來應付這些不識相的傢伙。第二次大戰中，蒙帥在每星期六下午往往召集部下，親致訓詞。他是以痛恨抽香烟著名的，通大名鼎鼎的美國威爾基都曾因在吃飯時抽香烟而碰過他的釘子，當然這些聽衆們沒有一個再敢吞雲吐霧的了，大家默然靜坐。這時蒙帥便大步走到台上，先是一聲不響，對聽衆們嚴厲的凝視一兩分鐘，然後，他用冰冷的口氣說：「我給你們兩分鐘，專門讓你們咳嗽醒鼻涕。以後我說話的時候，總可以靜一點了。」</p>
<p>聰衆們總是從此鴉雀無聲，靜靜聽訓的。</p>
<h3>論搶購</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>費十四元欣然購「人類的命運」回家，正燃起，一烟，打算拜讀，在數幾張鈔票的妻發言了：「早要買麵粉，火油，絨線，躭擱着不買，現在又貴了。不去搶購的人註定吃虧！一一聞此言，不覺放下書來胡思亂想。想了一陣，覺得搶購東西者眞是與己爲敵，至少於己無益，試略論之。</p>
<p>據報上說，搶購風中，連繍花鞋子也成了目標。據我目擊，則金子店門前早就排隊鵠立，戶限爲穿。所以搶購，不外乎（一）怕錢不值錢，或（二）大家擁有多金。倘屬前者，則愈搶購，錢必愈不值錢。譬如說本來限價一元一尺的呢絨，你不去搶購，店主人不敢漲價，你一搶購，他至少魚目混珠，把次貨當作上貨。你這時只要有貨可購，那裏還管貨色。上次我在「一烟之微」一文中引一位烟阪子所說的話正是最好註釋：「買也買不到，還管霉不霉。」具爛不論的搶購，正足促成本來值錢的錢到不值錢的地步。我家裏有一條大人穿不來小孩又嫌大的中不中西不西褲子，我反對家人搶購東西時，卽以此爲喻：當初買得這條褲子，一定以爲得到便宜了，但在今日看來，當時的一褲之值固然已值不了一分一厘金圓，但這條褲子除佔抽屜一角地位以外，又有什麼價值。這是講不必需之物。卽使是肥皂火油煤球之類的日用品，我也不贊成搶購。第一，我能搶購到的能用幾時？有了一年之需的總算很多了，但我總想活到八十歲。第二，十多年來，中國人常常搶購東西，然搶購的人無一不生活始終困難。搶購了一箱兩箱肥皂的人，何嘗有什麼好處！我想：搶購者的得失如下表：</p>
<p>得：購得了便宜肥皂一挑或一箱。</p>
<p>失：引起了火油火柴草紙等等以至百物的漲價。</p>
<p>得：購足了一年的一切物品，一年無虞漲價。</p>
<p>失：引起了此後若干年的百物漲價。</p>
<p>（假如東西用完，人亦壽終，當然得了便宜。）</p>
<p>準此，我是不搶購任何東西的—至多書籍。因爲搶購也搶購不完（卽使有錢），尤其是一搶購只能促成物價之漲，所謂扳了磗頭自壓脚也。</p>
<p>我作此諭，並非表示大爺有錢滿不在乎而說風凉話，或發阿Q脾氣。我覺得中國上上下下的所作所爲，常多志在自私自利而結果卒爲自害者，故借題發揮之。至於眞有多金而搶購東西之人，其胡塗更可嘆息，容續諭之。</p>
<h3>上海公用事業考源</h3>
<p>— 仲堅</p>
<p>公用事業之發達乃現代化都市之象徵，今日歐美都市鄕村均能普遍享受廉價之電氣及自來水等供應。當此等事業初在我國興辦時，反而備受阻礙，且多可笑之事實，爰略述上海公用事業之起源如左：</p>
<p>煤氣　淸同治三年（一八六四年），上海自來火公司成立，工部局特許其在地下舖設總管。翌年，租界內各馬路原有之油燈亦改裝爲煤氣路燈。</p>
<p>電燈　煤氣燈沿用旣久，居民漸感其燈光暗淡而表不滿。光緒八年（一八八二年），美人李德立（R.W.Little）呈准工部局？假用路燈木桿，再添設電桿多條，試行磨擦發電法。是年六月，李德立於外灘公園高臺上，裝置樣燈一蓋，觀者咸讀美不置。嗣復呈准在中國人家，上海總會，及法租界等處，裝置電燈。惟當時電燈本屬新奇之物，致易招反對。上海道謂電氣性質危險，能殺人燬屋，削全城爲平地，荀不立卽停止通電，必致肇禍。煤氣公司亦力表反對，因恐電燈興辦之後，其營業將受影響也。自是之後，兩公司競爭多年，雖電氣事業獲得最後勝利，但煤氣因在住戶及工業方面，仍有用途，故尙能維特至今。</p>
<p>電話　光緒七年（一八八一年），大北電報公司兼辦上海電話事業，時電話用戶，除工部局各機關外，全市不過三百三十八家。</p>
<p>自來水　上海給水，向恃黃浦江及蘇州河兩處，井水旣味鹹不可飲，河水又污穢不堪。至光緒六年，始由工部局與洋商Drysdale　Ringer　Co.訂約，裝設水管，並在江西路設立水塔。光緒九年（一八八三年）四月，開始放水，時李鴻章適在上海，因親往參加開幕禮焉。但當時市民對之疑信參半，一則因公司收取水費，一則因不明暸自來水之功用，以爲水有毒質，或謂水經電鍍，甚至謂水塔下有人溺斃，會審公廨不得已，乃出示曉諭，以釋羣疑。</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 晋霖</p>
<p>法國的自然科學家范勃曾在西部非洲發現世界最老的樹木，它的年齡，在六千年以上。</p>
<p>世界海洋最深的地點是菲律賓和日本之間的太平洋，那裏的深度是三萬二千尺。</p>
<p>在紐約有一種奇異的職業，就是專門剷除粘在馬路上的橡皮糖渣，每人週薪二十五元美金。該項職業，尙爲世界創舉。</p>
<p>世界上分量最輕的礦物—鈹，現已能被紡織成布料，其輕軟光潔與眞絲無異。</p>
<h3>記趙叔</h3>
<p>— 彭欲聲</p>
<p>趙撝叔（之謙），早年貧無立錐，嘗梄身於紹興城上更樓中，時潥陽繆武烈公（梓）官是邑，一日，偶見其所製春聯，大加賞識，立卽禮聘至其幕中，並爲譽揚京師公卿間，於是撝叔之金石書畫，紙貴洛湯，聲價十倍。一時多士，如潘伯寅·魏稼孫·沈韻初等，多折服其才能，爭相與交。</p>
<p>咸豐十年，太平軍陷杭州，武烈督戰殉難。將軍瑞昌奏准優卹，巡撫王有齡，恃寵專橫，與武烈素不相能，因武烈嘗譏其仕不由正途，（按王本一豐大使，得制軍何桂淸識拔，不數年卽擢至江蘇布政使，旋升浙江巡撫。）至是，乃以「偏執己見，創議株守，以致省垣陷落，咎無可逭」等詞，奏參撤銷武烈卹典，以洩其恨。　叔以武烈實係督戰陣亡，遇害最爲慘烈，且服官淸正，車著治績，桿衛衢州，保障浙西，厥功尤偉，遂與邵燮元等，向都察院呈訴，爲之辯白。旋經總督左宗棠，巡撫李瀚章，藩司蔣益灃，先後覆奏，卒得開復原卹典，予謚「武烈」，復撥款建立專祠於杭州金衙莊，與公同時戰死之守備孫遇龍，馬夫丁春漢，皆得從祀焉。</p>
<p>武烈之子繆芷汀（德棻）旣觀察江右，撝叔得其援引，任事江西志書局，旋宰南城，頗有政聲。南城縣署，傳夙有蛇神，凡官此者，無不虔敬如神，獨撝叔不之信，甚至指爲妖孽，未幾病歿，先輩傳說，往往以爲死於蛇，實則傷寒病死耳。</p>
<p>撝叔金石書畫，莫不精絕，久爲藝林所重，其精心之作，武烈後人收藏獨多，予所有手札千數百通，册頁便面廿餘事，亦武烈家散出也。</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆</h3>
<p>— 馬壽</p>
<p>從白華集序看二陳</p>
<p>詩國羣叟，凋零殆盡，散原石遺兩叟，墓木亦且拱矣。散原晚年，修養甚高，詩境特樸，所謂「梗袡豫章，天下名木，精悍直理，密緻博通」，允稱近代第一手。同時之石遺，則歌舞人間，七十生兒納妾，象徵其詩事之佻健，視散原之游泳太熙，冲和自適者，固有問矣。</p>
<p>比於舊書坊中，見張默君之白華草堂詩集，得讚二陳之序，情文各異。散原一作，吐詞甚簡，而意致貞誠，所致頌於默君者，身分恰好，固無毫髮之憾。石遺一作，則未甚嚴肅，至比默君爲上官婉兒，母乃稍失之調謔乎？而文彩畹黯，比事擾雜，信是率意之文，默君編次，使亞於散原，意殆亦有所宋懌矣。</p>
<p>最有趣者，則二陳之序，寫默君尊人張伯純處特多，寫默君自身處刦少，此作序之別格，亦二叟當時之苔心也。</p>
<p>社會服務　讀者諮詢　法律釋疑</p>
<h3>宗法社會的醜劇　領養子族長行匈</h3>
<p>編者先生：家叔早故，無子女，生前亦未囑何人承繼。今春叔母領表弟爲養子，請族長及地方紳士等多人立約，令我大哥簽字。大哥因我兄弟三人，不能全權作主，卽予拒絕（但聲明叔母領表弟作嗣並不反對）。當時族長以有犯其尊嚴，將大哥痛毆，讀者與二哥在申經商，得信後心殊不平。茲有疑問數點，懇爲裁答：（一）叔母領表弟作嗣，是否合法？（二）大哥因事實困難，未簽字是否缺理？（三）族長壓迫簽字未遂，動武毆打，是否違法？（四）叔母領表弟作嗣，事先並未通知，可否不予承認？讀者曹椿上。</p>
<p>〔姜屏藩律師答〕（一）立嗣爲宗法社會之遺法，現在民法中並無規定。叔母領表弟爲養子，依法不得謂爲不合。（二）領養子不必經汝大哥之同意簽字。（三）毆打應負刑事上之責任。（四）無通知必要，亦無爾等承認之必要。</p>
<h3>服務簡報</h3>

<h3>Fierce Street Battles Unfold in Jinzhou; National Army Soldiers Defend Heroically; Fan Hanjie and Others Personally Supervise the Battle; Reinforcements Advancing from Jinxi Recapture Tashan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, PanYang, 14th dispatch] Jinzhou is a sea of fire, with fierce street battles unfolding. Since the 13th, bandits have mobilized artillery to bombard the city day and night, causing numerous fires that are spreading rapidly. Under the cover of artillery fire on the night of the 13th, the bandits launched a general offensive. The defending soldiers fought with all their might, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th dispatch] On the night of the 13th, the bandits fired over a thousand shells at Jinzhou. In addition, the bandit army outnumbered the defending soldiers by many times, and their attack was fierce. On the morning of the 14th, the southeast corner of the city was first breached by the bandits. The defending soldiers fought valiantly and finally drove the bandits out. In the afternoon, the bandits returned with a vengeance and breached the defenses again. Another group of bandits broke through the northeast corner on the morning of the 14th and infiltrated the Zhongfang Company. The defending soldiers switched to defending the railway bureau line. The old provincial government area in the northern part of the city was also occupied on the morning of the 14th. This led to a full-scale street battle, with the sounds of gunfire and hand grenades blending into one, and the sound of killing shaking the heavens and the earth, creating an extremely tragic scene. In the afternoon of the 14th, a unit of the National Army was firmly defending the military station. The National Army around the railway bureau building was in high spirits, and the bandits had not yet been able to advance. The Guashi area outside the east gate of the old city, originally a concentrated business area for merchants, is now in the midst of a chaotic battle. Fan Hanjie, Lu Junquan, and Sheng Jiaxing, the commander of the 93rd Army, are all personally supervising the battle and are still in contact with this area as of the time of the dispatch. They are prepared to fight to the last soldier, remaining steadfast and unyielding. The reinforcements advancing eastward from Huludao and Jinxi, after several days of fierce fighting, recaptured Tashan in one fell swoop on the 12th. They have now advanced to Gaoqiao and are fiercely attacking the bandit troops defending Gaoqiao, in order to open up the road to Jinzhou as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th dispatch] The old city in the southwest corner of Jinzhou city is still being firmly defended by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinxi, 14th dispatch] The Liaoxi Campaign has reached its climax. The battle for Tashan is unprecedentedly fierce. Naval gunboats at Dayushan Haikou are providing artillery support, and the Air Force is carrying out incessant bombing raids throughout the day. The army, navy, and air force are urgently coordinating and fiercely attacking the bandit troops. Lin Biao's 4th Column, Wu Kehua's unit, has suffered the loss of one division, amounting to over six thousand men. Villages near Tashan have all been captured. The vanguard unit of the National Army, Zhu's unit, entered Tashan Town at 3:00 PM on the 14th. Hand-to-hand combat has begun, and a street-by-street battle is unfolding throughout the town. The National Army combat corps has arrived, and a large-scale annihilation battle is still in progress.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tanggu, 14th dispatch] It is learned that the Jinxi airport has been completed. The first (C-17) aircraft landed in Jinxi on the 12th, and large-scale air transport has begun.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Elite National Army troops are landing in Tanggu in a steady stream to strengthen the defenses of eastern Hebei. Military transport between Tanggu and Huludao is frequent. Large quantities of National Army ammunition and supplies are being reinforced to western Liaoning. Song Qingtang, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in North China, departed from Tanggu by gunboat on the 14th to inspect the troops at a certain port.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, PanYang, 14th dispatch] The Shenyang Western Corps achieved a great victory on the west bank of the Liao River. In the afternoon of the 13th, they recaptured Houxinqiu, 25 kilometers northeast of Zhangwu. Another route fiercely attacked the 5th Bandit Column 7 kilometers southwest of Zhangwu. The remnants of the bandits crossed the Raoyang River and fled in the early morning of the 14th. The National Army is in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th dispatch] Airdrops to Changchun resumed yesterday. The attacking National Army has not encountered any large-scale battles with the bandits after recapturing Mengjiatun and other places. The municipal government has dispatched a large number of personnel to the newly recovered townships to carry out rehabilitation work.</p>
<h3>National Army Captures Chaoyi in Shaanxi; Major Battle Enters the Stage of Pursuit and Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 14th dispatch] The National Army in eastern Shaanxi, sweeping east from Dali, has recaptured Chaoyi County. The remnants of the bandits have merged with the bandits who attacked Dali and are retreating north.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The major battle in eastern Shaanxi has entered the stage of pursuit and suppression. In the battle of Da Haoying, the 2nd and 4th Bandit Columns suffered extremely heavy casualties, and the other three columns also suffered casualties. On the evening of the 13th, the National Army north of Dali, after the Air Force destroyed the bandit artillery positions south of Weizhuang, took advantage of the momentum this morning to cooperate with the Air Force and captured Yongfeng Town, Tangzhuang, Tihu, Yuanpan and other important strongholds southeast of Chengcheng. The bandit's cover defense line was completely broken through, and the bandit army fled in disarray northwards to Chengcheng and Shaoyang. The Dali National Army has gathered, and all the remaining reinforcements have arrived, with extremely strong strength, and are now pursuing and suppressing the bandits.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Xi'an base air force continued to attack, bombing and killing more than 1,500 bandits fleeing north on the highways north of Dali and south of Chengcheng Heyang, destroying 20 wagons loaded with materials, and destroying many bandit positions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 14th dispatch] Our pursuit corps is advancing smoothly and rapidly, has reached the designated position, and is carrying out a strong suppression of the fleeing bandits. The major battle is continuing.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th dispatch] A Chinese official said on the 13th that the report on US aid to China at the beginning of this week was indeed true in fact, but without further clarification, it may mislead careless readers. They said that, as mentioned, China had purchased 42 P-47 fighter jets from US surplus materials, but none of them had been transferred to the management of Chinese personnel in the US, and these aircraft would need to be repaired before they could be of any practical use before being shipped to China.

<h3>Press Release from the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense: Review of Recent Battle Situation; Deng Wenyi Denies National Army Landing at Yingkou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] When answering questions at a press conference on the afternoon of the 14th, Deng Wenyi, spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense, stated: (1) There is no news of the National Army withdrawing from Yantai, but recently a unit of the National Army and civilians have indeed left Yantai. (2) Reports that the National Army landed at Yingkou and has captured Yingkou are inaccurate. The strength of the bandit army in Yingkou is very weak, and the National Army can take it at any time, but it has not attacked. (3) The National Army that launched an offensive from Changchun is still operating in the vicinity. There is no truth to the rumor that the authorities have ordered a retreat.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released the following article on the 14th: "Review of Recent Battle Situation":</p>
<p>A. Bandit Conspiracy and National Army's Bandit Suppression Strategy</p>
<p>The bandits launched their so-called autumn offensive last month, with central Shandong and western Liaoning as the main battlefields, and Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan as supporting battlefields, attempting to sever the connection between our Northeast and North China, and to disrupt the communication between our important strategic bases in North China and Central China. They also sought to connect the bandit forces in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, and Central China. They first attacked Jinan, then raided western Liaoning, damaged the Beining and PingSui railways, threatened GuiSui, Zhangyuan, Datong, and Taiyuan, and roamed Guanzhong, attempting to damage the Longhai and PingHan-Jinpu southern section railways. They implemented a siege battle and propagated that after military success, they would convene the so-called New Political Consultative Conference to prepare for the establishment of a puppet government to expand their rebellion conspiracy.</p>
<p>In order to crush the bandits' conspiracy and annihilate the main force of the bandit army, the National Army gradually adopted active offensives on various battlefields, concentrating its forces. On one hand, it severely struck the bandit troops of Lin Biao and Chen Yi in the main battlefield, and on the other hand, it dealt a head-on blow to the bandit troops of Nie Rongzhen, He Long, Xu Xiangqian, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng in the supporting battlefields. The powerful offensives launched by the National Army stationed in Northeast Changfan changed the situation in the northern and western Liaoning battlefields. The counter-offensive of the National Army in Chahar-Suiyuan and Shanxi-Shaanxi made the bandits exhausted and suffered heavy losses. In particular, the great victory in eastern Shaanxi caused Peng Dehuai's bandit troops, who had been rearming and replenishing for half a year, to almost repeat the Donglong debacle, with one-third of them being routed and annihilated. As for the two bandit troops of Chen and Liu in Central and East China, although they concentrated their forces and prepared for defensive offensives, the National Army is steadily advancing towards the bandits. The National Army has fully gained the initiative on various battlefields, while the bandits' forces are scattered and gradually falling into a passive position. At present, the National Army's strategy for suppressing bandits is to consolidate Central China, ensure the transportation between the Northeast and North China, concentrate forces, seek a decisive battle with the main force of the bandits, and not focus on the gains and losses of one city or town. Looking at the situation on various battlefields, in the autumn operations, the National Army has clearly and gradually gained the advantageous position of shifting from defense to offense and from defeat to victory.</p>
<p>B. Situation on Various Battlefields</p>
<p>(1) Northeast Battlefield: In the past week, the National Army has taken strong new actions. The garrison of Changchun is launching offensives outwards, and the bandit troops are retreating one after another. Our airdropped food and ammunition are no longer obstructed by bandit artillery fire. Our powerful corps in PanYang launched a large-scale westward offensive, and on the afternoon of the 11th, recovered Zhangwu. The bandit 5th Column and Mongolian bandits suffered casualties and fled. Fierce fighting continued southwest of Zhangwu for days. Another National Army force captured Raoyang River southwest of Xinmin on the morning of the 12th and is currently advancing towards Xinlitun Dahu Mountain. Our powerful corps advancing north from Huludao also began attacking the bandits on the 10th and entered Tasha Mountain northeast of Jinxi on the morning of the 12th. The 11th and 12th divisions of the bandit 4th Column retreated eastward. Seeing the rapid progress of our armies on all fronts, the bandits concentrated their forces to intensify their invasion of Jinzhou. The battle once approached the suburbs. The Jinzhou garrison launched a fierce counter-offensive against the invading bandits with close air artillery coordination on the evening of the 11th, and recovered Beidaying in the early hours of the 12th. The bandit 8th Column retreated eastward. Another unit attacking south of Jinzhou once captured Liujiatun on the morning of the 12th. The bandits sent reinforcements to counterattack, and fierce fighting is still underway. As for the bandits on the northwest sides, after a fierce offensive by the National Army, one division of the bandit's Third Column was annihilated. Our regimental commanders suffered casualties of one each. The bandits have now retreated from Liangma Mountain and Shiqiaozi (north of Jinzhou). The National Army on this front is launching an advantageous counter-offensive. The decisive battle in the two Jinzhens has been going on for several days, and the outcome will be decided soon.</p>
<p>(2) North China Battlefield: Because the bandit Nie's activities in southern Suiyuan and southern Chahar were suppressed by our army, the battle has gradually shifted eastward this week. The main force of the bandit 3rd and 4th Columns, part of the 2nd Column, and the bandit units such as the Independent 7th Division, Independent 8th Division, and Independent 1st Brigade, are roaming around Kangzhuang and Juyongguan inside and outside the Great Wall. After the Changping National Army launched an offensive to the periphery on the 7th, after four days of repeated fierce fighting, it finally repelled the invading bandits on the morning of the 12th. Another group of bandits attacking the Xinbaoan Railway Station was also dealt a head-on blow by our army and fled north on the morning of the 12th. Part of the 4th Column retreated southwest.</p>
<p>The war in Taiyuan has also become more intense this week. There have been fierce battles for Xinying, Gaozhong and other villages around the Wusu Airport 30 li south of the city, Shizuizi about 20 li southeast to north of the city, and Fenggeliang and other places 30 li northeast of the city west of the city. Since noon on the 11th, the bandit 22nd and 39th Brigades have continued to attack Xinying, Gaozhong and other villages, as well as the blockhouses in the southwest corner of Wusu, but they were all bravely repelled by our army. Some bandits who broke into Wusu Village were completely annihilated by the National Army. The battles in the above locations are still ongoing.</p>
<p>(3) Northwest Battlefield: Since Peng Dehuai's bandit troops suffered a disastrous defeat in the Jingwei River valley, they fled to the Huanglong Mountain area to rest and reorganize. Recently, with the help of the bandit army in southern Shanxi, they have gathered their four columns of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns to invade south again. After the National Army lured the bandits away from the Huanglong Mountain area this time, because the pre-arranged deployment was strict, after the bandits fled to Pingmin, Chaoyi, and Dali (all southeast of Heyang Chengcheng), a full-scale offensive was launched immediately. The bandits attacking Dali have been severely wiped out by our army in Dahaoying, East and West Han Villages, Yanzhi Mountain and other places since the 11th. By noon on the 13th, nearly one-third of the bandit 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns were killed or wounded, and they fled north in a panic. More than 7,000 bodies were left near Dahaoying and Han Village. Our pursuing troops have reached the line east and west of Shuangquan Town and are intensifying their pursuit and suppression of the fleeing bandits. Peng's bandit troops, who had been reorganized and replenished for half a year, have once again suffered a disastrous blow from us.</p>
<p>(4) Other Areas in Western Henan and Northern Hubei: The bandit troops of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng are still lingering on the west side of the PingHan Railway and dare not act rashly. The National Army is launching a sweeping battle in the southwest area of the PingHan Railway, and the air force is also conducting constant reconnaissance and bombing in the area. As for southwest Shandong, as the National Army continues to press north, Chen Yi's bandit troops are successively transferring south, concentrating their forces in Jining, Yanzhou, and southern Shandong, attempting to resist stubbornly. There have been no major battles in this area in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Allocation Problem of Production Materials</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, people are now paying attention to how to increase production and how to maintain production. This is progress! Because it is very dangerous to only know about price limits and forget about production. To produce, one cannot be without raw materials, so everyone is paying attention to the source of raw materials, but few people pay attention to the allocation problem of raw materials. The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee recently resolved that, except for the allocation of cotton, fuel, and imported raw materials, which are managed by specialized agencies, the allocation methods for the remaining raw materials without allocation agencies will be formulated by the Industrial Association and submitted to the Supervisory Office for approval and implementation. According to this speculation, the future distribution channels of raw materials will be no more than the following two: (1) Specialized material management agencies, such as the China Trust Bureau; (2) Industrial associations or their respective industry associations. In the past, the distribution of materials was generally handled through the above channels, and in the future, it will follow the old regulations, which will not be difficult to achieve the effect of being familiar with the road. However, the scope of intra-industry distribution is often limited to the same industry (that is, members participating in the association), and the distribution of materials by specialized management agencies is often conditional on whether they are members or have obtained a license or registration certificate. Those that are stricter must also determine the grade according to the size of their scale. As a result, the following three types of factories often do not have the right to be allocated: (1) small factories, (2) handicrafts; (3) new businesses that are not allowed to join the association. According to current laws, regardless of whether it is commerce or industry, there are mandatory provisions for joining associations. Strictly speaking, there are no businesses outside the association, and all businesses are of course members. However, the new Industrial Association Law is more restrictive, and there is a category of smaller factories that are not allowed to join the association due to the lack of power equipment or the number of workers employed not meeting the statutory number. Also, due to the implementation of rationing, there are indeed a small number of associations that deliberately set up prohibitions or create various difficulties, making it impossible for newly established factories to obtain the qualifications of members. The most prominent of the small factories that hold back are yarn factories with less than 3,000 spindles. There are also various production cooperatives that do not join industry associations due to their different organizations, and of course, they cannot participate in the distribution; this is even more contrary to the economic policy of the Three People's Principles of the government advocating cooperative enterprises.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned categories of industries have a relatively small scope and weak productivity. From the perspective of increasing production alone, their relationship is relatively minor. However, there are many units, and the total number is still considerable. Moreover, due to the poor equipment, the number of people they employ is relatively higher than that of large factories, so from the point of view of maintaining employment, its seriousness cannot be ignored. In order to avoid unemployment and encourage production, we hope that these small-scale industries will be taken care of when allocating raw materials, so that they can share the benefits equally, so as not to affect the entire social economy.</p>
<p>The promotion of cooperatives was originally a fixed national policy, and it should have priority in the allocation of materials according to law; small factories that have joined the association and newly established factories that have started operations are both production enterprises, and there is no reason to discriminate against them. The problem lies in the factories that do not meet the statutory conditions and the handicrafts that are not yet organized. We must find ways to unite them separately so as to undertake this distribution work. Because the group is the link between the top and the bottom, all application, acceptance, and distribution tasks must be handled by this link. If it is too scattered, as it is now, even if the material agencies treat everyone equally and intend to help, they will feel helpless, let alone group purchases and solve the raw material problem themselves.</p>
<p>Handicrafts are general factories or home industries. If there is no suitable statutory organization to organize, it is best to guide them to organize production cooperatives so as to make it easier to gather things together. As for small factories that do not meet the statutory conditions, if they are not allowed to join the industrial association, they should find other ways to allow them to unite and help each other to make up for it. In our opinion, the source and allocation of raw materials are equally important. If some production organizations are in a state of stagnation because they cannot obtain the allocated raw materials, then even if the raw materials have a source, the problem is still not completely solved.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lisheng Sticks to the Defense Line and Will Not Consider Negotiated Prices; He Said That There Is Only One Way to Eliminate the Black Market, and There Will Be No End to Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Zhang Lisheng said today on the issue of negotiated prices: The government will never consider the term "negotiated prices." The so-called negotiation is like seeking skin from a tiger, and there will be no end to the negotiation. For goods purchased after August 19, if merchants provide valid reasons, the government should approve them according to their costs when necessary, rather than negotiate. Also, prices should not be negotiated because there is a black market. There is only one way to eliminate the black market, which is to crack down on it. This is my core belief, and I will work hard to implement it accordingly. Success should be expected. If it is not successful, everyone should be responsible, and the people should all have this belief. Zhang believes that the universal distribution of daily necessities is a good way to curb prices.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhang Lisheng convened all representatives of Hebei and Ping municipal leaders and relevant agencies at 3 pm today to discuss the issue of prices and materials. It was decided that the prices of oil, matches, cloth, salt, and grain must not exceed the limited prices and must be strictly rationed and sold.</p>
<h3>Baoding Negotiates Prices for Grain, Oil, etc.</h3>

<h3>Supervisory Commissioner Hao Yulin Writes to Zhang Lisheng, Criticizing the Reasonableness of Price Limits</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Hao Yulin, the Supervisory Commissioner of the Supervision Committee of the Hebei-Rehe-Chahar Supervisory Commissioner's Office, recently wrote to Zhang Lisheng, criticizing the price limit policy. The letter was more than 2,000 words long, stating that the prices were secretly rising and increasing, making people turn pale at the mention of them. The price limits on August 19 were far against the natural trend, so they produced all kinds of black markets, whose prices exceeded the price limits by three, four, or even ten times, but buyers rushed to buy them. The malpractices caused by rigid price limits are beyond the imagination of the authorities: (1) materials are even more scarce, (2) materials are easily flowing into bandit areas, (3) poor households suffer even more, (4) restricting bank interest rates and making floating capital abound and merchants refuse to sell. Based on the above reasons, the price limits on August 19 have reached the point where a reasonable adjustment is necessary. Before the controls, one bingchuan fenhe jinyuan was more than 7 yuan, but in recent months it has risen to 60 yuan, so it is suggested that (1) local prices do not need to be rigidly stipulated by the central government, and (2) the prices of goods used by only a few people may be increased as much as possible during negotiations.</p>

<h3>Hopes Dashed for Extra-Council Compromise on Berlin Question - Security Council to Resume Debate Today - Soviet Response Fails to Satisfy the Three Powers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] The United Nations Security Council convened on the 14th to discuss the Palestine issue, but the Berlin debate remained the central focus of all problems. The Security Council plans to resume the Berlin debate on the 15th. The US representative Jessup, the British representative Cadogan, and the French representative Parodi held new talks this morning to draft a plan to condemn the Soviet Union as an aggressor and a threat to peace as soon as possible. It is reported that the three are drafting a motion to be submitted when the Security Council resumes the Berlin debate. The Soviet representative Vyshinsky will certainly veto the Western motion. If the West fails in the Security Council, it will inevitably move the court of "trial" for the Soviet Union to the General Assembly, passing the Western proposal as a recommendation. The Soviet Union has no veto power in the General Assembly and will not be able to repeat its old tricks. Vyshinsky insisted on the 13th that the Berlin crisis should be removed from the Security Council's agenda before negotiations are sought for an agreement, which the West refused. Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, who has been running around for reconciliation for the past week, spoke with Vyshinsky and the three Western representatives again on the 14th. His assistant said that Bramuglia had given up hope of avoiding a showdown vote in the Security Council, and hinted that Argentina might abstain from voting at that time. The representatives of the three Western powers will meet again tonight to plan their future actions. At the same time, the six neutral members of the Security Council also held a meeting to consider the pressure from the three powers to support a joint resolution condemning the Soviet Union. It is generally expected that Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia will open the resumed debate on the Berlin issue on the 15th, report on the mediation process, and announce his recommendations and responses to both sides.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th, United Press] The Soviet Union today demanded that the Berlin case be withdrawn from the Security Council as the first step towards resolving the Berlin crisis, thereby closing the door to an early resolution of the Berlin crisis. The above request was the Soviet Union's response to the compromise proposal submitted by Security Council President Bramuglia to Soviet representative Vyshinsky. According to sources close to the three powers, the Soviet response was unsatisfactory. Bramuglia convened the Security Council to meet on the 15th to resume discussion of the Berlin crisis. Bramuglia visited Vyshinsky today for an hour to gather the Soviet Union's response to the mediation efforts. Bramuglia's mediation efforts were based on the simultaneous lifting of the Berlin blockade and the convening of a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the entire German issue. The three powers, which have been in constant contact regarding the Berlin negotiations, believe that the Soviet response includes the following unsatisfactory conditions: (1) The three powers will not agree to the condition of withdrawing the Berlin case from the Security Council's agenda. (2) The East and West should return to the situation as of August 30. The four powers in Moscow agreed to discuss the blockade and currency system plan together, but after the negotiations moved to Berlin, the Soviet Union ignored the above plan.</p>
<h3>Security Council Discusses Holy Land Issue - Listens to Bunche Report - Assassination of Mediator Bernadotte - China, Britain, and France Request Detailed Explanation from Israel</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] The United Nations Security Council convened on the 14th to discuss the Palestine issue. A British spokesman said that the United States and Britain both supported the late Bernadotte's report to the United Nations, considering it the best basic solution to the Holy Land war. Attempts by the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Syria to delay the Security Council's consideration of violations of the Holy Land ceasefire agreement by both Arabs and Jews have failed. The Security Council ultimately voted eight to zero, with three abstentions, to adopt the agenda and continue to listen to the report of Acting Mediator Bunche.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast: Acting Holy Land Mediator Bunche called on the Security Council to take action on the assassination of Bernadotte. The representatives of China, Britain, and France all supported this, proposing a resolution demanding that the Israeli government provide a complete report on the assassination and requesting that the Israeli and Arab governments grant United Nations representatives free passage and security guarantees.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast: Bunche accused the Jewish government of negligence in the assassination of Bernadotte and urged the Security Council to demand a detailed explanation from the Israeli government.</p>
<p>Bunche protested that he had not yet received a formal report from the Israeli government regarding the arrest of the Stern Gang.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast: United Nations Israeli representative Eban said in the Security Council that the Israeli government would do its best to determine the murderers of Bernadotte and report to the United Nations. Eban said that the Israeli government had taken strong action against the two major Jewish groups, the Stern Gang and the Irgun, and had dissolved them. Eban also stated that if United Nations observers wish to obtain free passage and appropriate protection, they should be distributed equally within Arab and Jewish territories.</p>
<p>The Security Council adjourned at 5:30 p.m. to allow representatives sufficient time to study the resolution proposed by Britain. The date of the next meeting has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>US Does Not Intend to Recognize Holy Land Arab Government</h3>
<p>Lovett announced at a press conference</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett announced at a press conference that the United States has recognized the State of Israel and therefore cannot recognize the newly established Palestine and Arab government.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London, 14th Broadcast: The Syrian and Lebanese governments announced on the 14th that they had recognized the Arab government established in the Gaza region of Palestine.</p>
<h3>British and American Occupation Zones in Germany Intensify Anti-Monopoly Stores Blockade</h3>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Telegraph Relaxes Conditions for Lifting Blockade</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London, 14th Broadcast: In order to intensify the anti-blockade against the Soviet occupation zone, the British and American governments have recently issued an order that any goods transported from the British and American occupation zones to the Soviet occupation zone without a bill of lading will be confiscated.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 14th] The Soviet Army newspaper "Daily Review" reiterated the Soviet Union's suggestion on the 14th that the Soviet blockade of Berlin would be lifted if the marks issued by the Western countries were withdrawn from Berlin. The newspaper also defended the Soviet Union, saying that the blockade was necessary to protect East Germany from economic conspiracies after the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany. The newspaper's editorial stated that the day the Western marks are withdrawn will be the day the traffic control is lifted.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives and House of Councillors Elect Prime Minister Through the Night - Yoshida Reelected as Prime Minister - Over 200 Spoiled Ballots - New Cabinet May Not Last Long</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese House of Councillors held a plenary session at 7:40 p.m. on the 14th to vote for the successor Prime Minister. The meeting adjourned at 8:03 p.m. The results of the election showed that Yoshida Shigeru was elected with an absolute majority of 144 votes. Other candidates received the following votes: Katayama Tetsu 29 votes, Kuroda Hisao 15 votes, Matsudaira Tsuneo 9 votes, and Miki Takeo 6 votes. The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 9:44 p.m. and was still discussing Yamazaki's resignation at the time of publication. The results of the election of the successor Prime Minister may not be revealed until midnight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Yoshida Shigeru, the president of the Japan Democratic Liberal Party and former Prime Minister, received more votes than the other five candidates in the first round of voting in the House of Representatives tonight, but failed to obtain a majority. In the first round of voting, he received 184 votes, but the House of Representatives has a total of 460 seats and needs 234 votes to constitute a majority. Katayama Tetsu, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, received only 87 votes, falling far behind Yoshida Shigeru and ranking second. Communist leader Tokuda Kyuichi received 4 votes, all of which were clearly cast by the four Communist members. There were also 86 blank spoiled ballots, which were clearly due to the abstention of all Democratic Party members. Because Yoshida Shigeru failed to obtain a majority in the first round of voting, a runoff election was required between Yoshida Shigeru and Katayama Tetsu. The House of Representatives immediately continued to hold a second round of voting late tonight. As a result, Yoshida Shigeru, the extremely conservative president of the Democratic Liberal Party, was elected with 185 votes. In the runoff election between Yoshida Shigeru and Katayama Tetsu, Katayama Tetsu received only one vote out of the 399 votes cast, and the number of abstentions in the form of blank ballots was 213. The election of Yoshida Shigeru, president of the Democratic Liberal Party, as the new Japanese cabinet, actually foreshadows that the new cabinet will be a short-lived cabinet, and its fate may not last more than a month or two. Yoshida Shigeru has declared that he will dissolve the parliament and hold general elections after a few important bills are passed by the current parliamentary session. Parliamentary sources pointed out that at least laws such as the National Public Service Act, the Supplementary Budget Act, and the Wage Stabilization Act must be passed by the current parliamentary session before it is dissolved. They expect that the legislative process to complete the above bills will take about a month. The results of the first round of voting in the House of Representatives today show that Yoshida Shigeru did not receive the support of the three former government parties, which still occupy the majority of seats in the parliament.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Ambitions Know No Bounds - Bevin Demands Showdown - Delivers Warning Speech in London</h3>
<p>[United Press to London, 14th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin demanded on the 14th that the Soviet Union declare the "scope of its ambitions." Bevin made his first speech since returning from the UN General Assembly, saying that the problem he wanted to solve was "Can we coexist in the world? What areas do they hope to inhabit? Do their ambitions know no bounds? The Soviets are expansionists, they are the last batch of imperialist forces, their extent is no less than that of the Tsars. We do not control anyone, we accept the concept of equality of religion, skin color, and status. In the areas we control, we strive for autonomy and independence.

<h3>US Strengthens Aid to China</h3>
<p>New Foreign Aid Plan to be Discussed at Next Meeting</p>
<p>China Could Receive $700 Million</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to a United Press survey on the 14th, regardless of the outcome of the November elections, the next Congress will deal with a record-breaking foreign aid plan totaling over $8 billion. The plan will strengthen military aid. The Far East will receive a larger share of both economic and military aid. The countries receiving aid will be China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe, Turkey, Austria, Greece, and Turkey. The aid planned for non-communist countries in the next fiscal year will reflect the current tense situation in the competition between the Eastern and Western blocs in the world. Due to the increased attention to the situation in the Far East, aid to that region will inevitably increase. One of the largest amounts will be the $4 billion needed for the second year of the European Recovery Program. In addition, over $1.5 billion in military aid is expected to be requested to reorganize the military equipment of Western Europe, making it the first line of defense for the United States. Regarding aid to China, approximately $450 million will be requested for economic aid and over $250 million for military aid, while the current total economic and military aid plan for China is only $400 million.</p>

<h3>British Commonwealth Prime Ministers Initiate Effort to Form Global Anti-Communist Alliance; Imperial Conference Plenary Session Reconvenes After Eighteen-Day Recess</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The plenary session of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference adjourned today and will reconvene on the 18th. In the meantime, group meetings will be held to study various issues and seek solutions to some difficult problems. Some delegates will take this opportunity to travel elsewhere before the plenary session resumes. For example, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will go to Paris today, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru will also go to Paris tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] The heads of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, after repeated behind-the-scenes consultations in recent days, have initiated a movement to organize a new "balancing force" against communism worldwide. It was learned on the 14th that their aim is to organize a new alliance, spanning Europe, Africa, and as far as the Far East, to form a belt of joint defense and act as a buffer between the two major powers, East and West. If this plan succeeds, 500 million people will unite to support the Western countries. The objectives of the British Commonwealth leaders are: (1) To dissuade India from leaving the Commonwealth and becoming an independent republic, so as to prevent India from becoming a victim of the communist fifth column in the Far East. They hope to firmly retain India within the Commonwealth as part of the "balancing force." (2) To use all means to bring Burma back into the Commonwealth. Burma's secession from the Commonwealth a year ago made it a good place for communist rebellion. (3) To step up the organization of Africa as a second line of defense. This is what the defense plan soon to be drafted by the Western European Union proposes. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt have exerted pressure on India not to leave the Eastern and Western blocs. Whether India participates in the new strategic system depends on Nehru's ability. According to the Independence Act, India and Pakistan have the right to leave the Empire. Indian public opinion insists that India should be a republic and ultimately break away from the British Empire. When Nehru returns home, Indians plan to hear his report on his declaration of secession at the conference. Nehru has now heard opinions from all sides and is in a dilemma.</p>
<h3>Belgian Communists' Anti-Government Conspiracy; Attempt to Incite Labor Unrest in Coordination with France and Italy; Authorities Take Precautionary Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Brussels, 14th] According to an informed source in the Belgian counter-intelligence agency on the 14th: The Comintern Information Bureau has instructed the Belgian Communist Party to use all its strength to overthrow the Spaak government. A few days ago, the Belgian Communist Central Committee was ordered to incite a movement to raise wages. He said: The counter-intelligence agency has obtained evidence confirming that this movement is actually linked to and coordinated with France and Italy. When the reporter asked how the Communist Party would proceed to overthrow the government, he replied: "We are already aware and have taken the necessary precautionary measures. This is all I can tell you." Three days ago, Belgian Communist Party Secretary-General Lalmont gave a speech advocating the overthrow of the coalition government of the Socialist Party and the Conservative Party to save the country's economic crisis. He said: "Spaak is nothing more than a puppet and slave of the United States." At this time, a member of the audience suddenly stood on his seat and shouted, "If I could sacrifice my life to make Spaak die, I would feel supremely happy." When Lalmont mentioned that Spaak would deliver a speech on the work of the United Nations on the 20th, he added: "We must show this person our strength, so that the current Belgian Prime Minister knows how strong our strength has become. We will all attend when Spaak speaks."</p>

<h3>Business is Too Good; Everyone is Complaining; Rice Suppliers Refuse to Accept Contracts; Restaurants Apply to Close Down</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Since the authorities strictly stipulated that daily necessities must be purchased with certificates, the general public's purchases have been restricted, and waste has been reduced. However, on the other hand, restaurants and rice suppliers have been greatly distressed by the purchase restriction policy. According to the recent statistics report of the restaurant industry, families with fewer ordinary people are finding it difficult to buy vegetables every day and are turning to rice suppliers for rice, or the whole family goes to restaurants to eat fixed-price meals. The largest consumption of fixed-price meals is oil and rice. Currently, the industry's purchases of oil and rice are entirely dependent on household registration certificates. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau allocates 170 pounds of flour per store per month. On average, the amount allocated to each store per month is often not enough for ten days of retail sales. Rice suppliers, due to limited inventory, have recently refused to accept contracts from customers. Many restaurants have also applied to the association for temporary closure. The industry association stated that in order to help all members overcome the current difficulties, in addition to immediately compiling statistics on the actual sales volume of oil, vegetables, meat, chicken, etc. of each member each month and forwarding them to the Social Affairs Bureau to request that it coordinate allocation, it will also apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for a purchase permit so that the industry can directly purchase rice in rice-producing areas outside of Shanghai, so as to continue to maintain the supply of meals to customers.</p>
<h3>Precious Gems and Jade are Vanishing; Average Price More Than Doubles</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to people in the pearl and jade industry, the industry's business usually peaks in August and September of the lunar calendar, because there are more festive events on the market at this time, and the demand for precious jewelry such as pearls and diamonds also increases. This year, the floating funds from the authorities' redemption of gold notes have also partly tended to search for pearls and diamonds, causing the high-end goods of pearls and diamonds on the market to disappear. The items that are usually bought and sold by colleagues are all mid-to-low-end goods. It is said that high-end goods are collected and treasured by collectors. Even if they occasionally flow out, those who can afford to buy them must treat them as treasures and keep them without selling them again. Currently, the items traded in the industry are mainly pearls, diamonds, and jadeite, and the average price is more than double what it was in 1919. It is said that prices in Tianjin are even more expensive than Shanghai. Yesterday, the reporter went to the pearl and jade market on Houjia Road. The market was still very lively, and trading seemed to be very prosperous. However, according to people in the industry, the actual transaction volume is only 70% of what it was in 1919. There are more than 100 members in the industry. The number of people engaged in the pearl and jade industry nationwide, including Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Xinjiang, is approximately 2 million. Recently, there has been talk that the authorities will stop the sale of luxury jewelry such as pearls and diamonds. The industry believes that many pearls and diamonds are domestically produced, and those who operate this business have a long history, so it seems inappropriate to classify it as the sale of prohibited imported luxury goods. Therefore, it has submitted a petition requesting that it be allowed to continue operating.</p>
<h3>Pacification and Reconstruction Team Holds Memorial Service for Martyred Cadres; Chiang Ching-kuo Earnestly Encourages Comrades</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The Pacification and Reconstruction Team held a memorial service for martyred cadres at the Lawyers Association at 3 pm yesterday. All officers stationed in Shanghai attended the service, and the atmosphere was very solemn. Chiang Ching-kuo personally presided over the ceremony, earnestly encouraging comrades to have the determination not to fear death and the spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness, to engage in revolutionary work. He firmly stated that the economic management of the city can gradually get on the right track and fundamentally solve the people's livelihood problems. His only hope is that the people will not panic, so as not to disrupt the steps. As for the fact that some citizens have many complaints about the current purchase restriction measures implemented by the authorities, he said that this is a manifestation of the impatience of the middle class. Today, they seem to have forgotten the stormy waves of price changes by the day in the past, and they do not know that if the purchase restriction measures are not implemented and the August 19 price limits are not strictly observed, then all commodity prices in the city may be transferred into the hands of scalpers and speculators within five or six days. Therefore, our methods can be changed, but our principles and position, once decided, will never change, and we will never deviate from our original intentions due to environmental stimuli, pressure, or temptation.</p>

Unexpectedly, the two lines touched each other, and the alarm bell at the Jing'an Temple Police Station rang loudly. Director Du immediately ordered Criminal Division Chief Yu Ding to lead a large number of police officers to rush to the scene in a police car. At the same time, he urgently reported to the General Bureau to send more flying fortresses and red police cars. After arriving at the destination, it was discovered that it was caused by a short circuit. Coincidentally, more than an hour later, the police station's alarm bell rang again. Upon learning that a case had occurred at No. 55, Lane 189, Jiangsu Road, Wuding Road, the original group of police officers boarded several jeeps and rushed to the scene. Soon, after hearing the news, the Criminal Division of the General Bureau also ordered Section Chief Feng Qishan to supervise Inspector Qin Boliang, police officer Ma Bingzhang, and others to drive to the scene. Flying fortresses and armed police officers from the Jiangning Road reserve team also arrived at the scene. The house is the residence of the famous educator Yin Zhiling. The Yin family suddenly saw a large number of plainclothes police officers breaking into the house, mistakenly believing them to be bandits. They pressed the alarm bell several times to warn the police and hurriedly opened the silver box and moved away valuable items. The male and female masters and servants all hid. Yin also temporarily hid under the Simmons mattress. After Section Chief Yu and others explained their intentions, they realized it was a misunderstanding. The house's alarm bell had also failed and was being repaired, causing the second false alarm.</p>

<p>The Life Bookstore ordered reactionary books. Xue Dichang (from Wujin), the manager of the store, and Chen Zhengda (from Ningbo), a trainee, were yesterday indicted by the Special Criminal Court for endangering the nation. Xue Dichang, as the manager of the Shanghai Life Bookstore, contacted the Hong Kong Life Bookstore to order various reactionary books and promoted and propagated communism in the country. On July 29th of this year, after being detected by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, they went to the store and seized "Popular Literature and Art Magazine" and were in the process of sorting and mailing them to subscribers.

<h3>Former Head of Water Police Bureau and Eight Others - Public Trial of Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty - Zhang Renyou Denies All Charges Listed in Indictment - Claims to Be Falsely Accused Due to Personal Grievances - Adjournment Ordered for Further Interrogation</h3>

The defendant Zhang Renyou, of medium build, neatly dressed, first made a statement on the organization, personnel, authority, and case handling procedures of the Water Police Bureau in response to questions from the court. Then, regarding the facts of the crime listed in the District Procuratorate's indictment, he stated separately:</p>
<p>Zhang Renyou - Substitute term</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the part accused of concealing evidence: Song Rende was instigated by Tao Qiyun and Ding Zhushi to be cut. According to the opinion signed by the judicial section chief of the bureau, bail was granted to Tao and Ding, and it was reported to the General Bureau for review and continued investigation, which can be verified. The accusation of "not pursuing the matter and not transferring it to the court" is untrue. (2) Regarding the defendant's dereliction of duty and the US dollar transactions of Tan Wenxi and others: The defendant stated that since taking office, he had been ordered to thoroughly rectify the wharves along the river, from the Waibaidu Bridge to the 16th Pier, fearing that it would hinder international appearances. The authorities paid particular attention to this. At that time, Baili Automobile Company was operating a US military business car service at Pier No. 10 on the Bund, and the private construction of wooden pavilions was an illegal building. The demolition was signed by patrol officer Luo Zhaoqiang of the bureau. Shen Huanling, the head of the first section of the bureau, said that the person in charge of the company, Xiong Du, had a bad attitude and planned to detain him for two days to show deterrence. Later, Chief Xu of the Foreign Affairs Section of the General Bureau notified by telephone that the Baili wooden pavilion was for the use of the US military and did not need to be strictly pursued, so it was reprimanded. Luo patrol officer's report did not mention the US dollar transaction of the company. It was later found that the US military used coupons for general use in designated venues, such as US military clubs, restaurants, swimming pools, etc. (Xu Chief's certificate and US dollar coupons were presented in court.)</p>
<p>Gun-carrying sailing ship - No suspicion found</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the defendant and Xia Zhemin receiving bribes: The defendant stated that the boat owner Zhou Daiqing's sailboat contained ten rifles, one thousand and three bullets, two wooden imitation rifles, and one hundred and thirty-two bullets. After investigation by the judicial staff of the bureau, Zhou Daiqing held a certificate from the Lanxiu Township Office, stating that he was applying for a license from the Ministry of Interior and there was no suspicion of private transportation. He was granted bail, so he was not transferred to the General Bureau. (4) Regarding the defendant's extortion of property by means of excuses: The defendant stated that on the day he took office, the case of Guo Liangzhen, the chief of general affairs of the New Fu Shen Steamer Company, and others involving manslaughter occurred, which was handled by Deputy Director Yan Shaobai. He was completely unaware of it and did not know the company's manager, Wu Delin. If there was any extortion, please summon witnesses to the court to inquire who received the bribe. (5) Regarding the defendant and Huang Boqian's encroachment on public property: The defendant stated that the bureau had a technical section responsible for the management of various fuel machinery. He took office on March 17, and the subordinate responsible personnel did not report that the No. 8 speedboat was damaged, so he still reported the amount of diesel oil as before. After investigation, he reported to the General Bureau that the amount of oil requested was incorrect and asked for correction. The General Bureau approved the record and denied that it was secretly reported and still protected without asking questions.</p>
<p>Selling Items at Ballgames - Fundraising to Repair House</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the defendant and Xie Yiyun's fraud of property: The defendant stated that Cao Yusheng's part of the theft of Texaco diesel was handled by staff member Xie Yiyun. As far as he knew, Xie was careful, cautious, hardworking, experienced, and not bribed. (7) Regarding Huang Boqian's theft of public property, seeking benefits from non-主管 affairs, and encroachment on public property: The defendant stated that at the beginning of his tenure, the bureau's buildings were dilapidated and the funds were short. The volunteer police held a ballgame to raise funds to supplement the insufficient funds for repairing the bureau's buildings. At one bureau affairs meeting, Deputy Director Yan and General Affairs Section Chief Huang attended and agreed to sell ownerless iron anchors, scrap iron wire, and old magnetic bathtubs outside the bureau to raise funds. He did not know about the sale of stolen coal. Later, it was found that the tea room attendant A San used the section chief's name and was dismissed. After Zhang finished speaking, he said: This accusation was completely due to jealousy and false accusations. The court ordered all defendants to sit down because the trial had been going on for a long time. The remaining eight defendants had to be questioned one after another.</p>
<p>Gun License Photos - Submitted for Reference</p>
<p>Huang Boqian stated: The bureau's fuel reimbursement and use were the responsibility of staff member Chen Shaoxi. He did not know that the No. 8 speedboat was damaged beforehand and denied falsely reporting the amount of oil. The sale of magnetic basins, iron anchors, etc., was decided by the bureau affairs meeting to raise funds to supplement the bureau's building repair fees. Xia Zhemin stated: After investigation, the guns and bullets of boat owner Zhou Daiqing were consistent with the certificate from the Lanxiu Township Office. Because there was no suspicion of private transportation, he was granted bail. The deputy director was not in the bureau that day, so he directly submitted it to Director Zhang for approval. Qin Shuming stated: He did not know Xia Zhemin and denied bribery. Zhou Daiqing stated: His sailboat sailed from Fuzhou, passed through Chongming, and arrived at Wusong. The guns and bullets were for defense against bandits. Because the gun license was expired, the Lanxiu Township Office temporarily issued a certificate and applied for a license from the Ministry of Interior at the same time, which has now been issued. After the statement, his defense lawyer submitted new gun license photos for the court's reference. Tan Wenxi stated: He is a shareholder of Baili Automobile Company, and the business is the responsibility of the manager and deputy manager. Liang Jinhao stated: He is the deputy manager of Baili. The wooden pavilion built on the Bund was for the convenience of US Navy personnel. The US dollar coupons received were still exchanged for legal tender. He did not ask anyone to intercede when the bookstore was shut down. Finally, Luo Zhaoqiang and Xie Yiyun answered and denied accepting bribes by virtue of their authority. The court stated that the facts of the case were generally clear and adjourned the meeting, and the witnesses will be summoned to the court for questioning next time.</p>

<h3>No Silk Available in the Market</h3>

The sales of silk shops are limited daily, and the turnover is also weak, and the market is deserted.</p>
<p>There were limited transactions of raw silk on a case-by-case basis. Because foreign firms have no goods to buy, absorption has stopped, and transactions are stagnant. Most domestic sales account holders are mostly watching, and the supply on the market is scarce, but silk factories are in great need, and the market shows that there are goods with no price.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Suzhou Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Spring and autumn are the seasons for Suzhou and Hangzhou. I am not very familiar with Hangzhou, but as for Suzhou, I am afraid that a small part of its prosperity relies on the occasional visits of wealthy young masters. Those of us who have lived in Suzhou for a long time feel that it is an ancient and declining city. There are no pedestrians in the deep alleys, and old women are miserably reeling silk or hunching over embroidering. This is an 18th-century picture of farming and weaving. Not to mention Shanghai, even Wuxi, its neighbor to the west, is probably rarely seen. And the ancestral halls and villas dotted in the alleys, the abandoned gardens, give people infinite historical sorrow. I am from Beijing, and I feel that it has some similarities with the old capital. These large cities that have been relieved of their responsibilities are heading towards the grave, and our origins and circumstances will often let out two sighs at this sunset, and there is nothing we can do. Therefore, I dare not even go to Tiger Hill and Lingyan Temple, for fear of causing deeper and heavier disillusionment.</p>
<p>Even so, the shops on Guanqian Street have been emptied by the rush to buy. I have walked through several foreign goods stores and cannot buy a good tube of toothpaste. Meat is also often unavailable. The people of Suzhou are law-abiding and do not necessarily all want to hoard, and they don't have that much spare money either. Obviously, some "cows" from Shanghai are playing tricks, coupled with the wealthy travelers joining in the fun, even the shelves of Cai Zhi Zhai are empty, and there is no way to buy some white sugar plums. Honest businessmen are not happy about this, but fearful. The week before, several large gold stores expanded their "temporary closure," fearing that they would follow suit. The most wonderful thing is that on the day I left Suzhou, when the time came to go to the station, I ran along Lindun Road, and no one was willing to go. I thought, could it be that labor is also being hoarded? Later, after inquiring in detail, I learned that it was because the order at the station was not good, especially those who acted as brokers, first disrupted the passengers and then recommended them to other drivers, taking a commission from it, causing the passengers to suffer all kinds of deception. So the station added wooden barriers around it, not allowing empty cars to enter the barriers or empty cars to leave the barriers, so the drivers were unwilling to go to the station, fearing that they would not be able to pick up passengers and would be detained. The Suzhou station drivers are notoriously fierce, but as a result, there is not even a single car, isn't it even more inconvenient for passengers? I don't know if it has improved these past two days.</p>
<p>The train is only more relaxed on the reserved seat trains, and all other trains are filled with smugglers. Smugglers do not not want to buy reserved seat tickets, but they are afraid of spot checks on the train. Looking at the dynamics of the social economy, smugglers are also a major sign. If someone wishes to write a history of Chinese smuggling, there will definitely be several very interesting chapters that can benefit people's wisdom. And today, the preservation and circulation of various materials should also be given special attention, so I carefully cut and pasted the photos of scalpers selling Western medicine in the Shen Bao into my photo album.</p>
<p>The first threat Nanjing gave us was also "cars." When we got off the train, it was just past 8 o'clock in the evening, and the cars of the Jiangnan Company were ready to go to the factory and would not carry passengers. The ticket office posted a sign saying "Few vehicles, please do not wait," which was much more threatening to us than the announcement "Cinema is full today, please come back early tomorrow." The Capital Company still had two cars, but at least four or five hundred people were crowded there to get on the car. I quickly found wild chicken taxis, one yuan per person, with no room for negotiation, so I had to squeeze in and become a sardine. Each car must be filled with seven passengers, plus the driver and the assistant, a total of nine people. It is said to be yellow croaker, how about calling it sardines? This is not even considered a rip-off. I took a rickshaw after getting off the bus at Xinjiekou. The distance that was only a dime half a month ago is now at least 3 jiao, and some ask for 5 jiao. I carried my travel bag and walked for more than ten minutes, and finally hired a rickshaw for 700,000 legal tender. I said to him, "How come the price of cars has risen so fiercely? 700,000 can buy more than a liter of rice, it used to be able to go to Xiaguan!" "Sir, rice is cheap, you can't talk about rice!" We civil servants really don't know what it feels like to hear this kind of talk. Others talk about rice when rice is expensive, and talk about money when rice is cheap. Only civil servants and teachers always value their salaries at the lowest standard, and it is really enough for people to arrange a life with a monthly salary of less than 100 yuan at this moment!</p>

<h3>Quick People, Quick Deeds</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>There are many people who like to cough or "sniffle" when listening to famous speakers or watching plays. Sometimes when the scene on stage is a little "cold," the audience is simply holding a cold competition, ruining the tense and solemn atmosphere completely, which is really laughable and absurd.</p>
<p>However, British General Montgomery has a set of foolproof methods to deal with these insensitive guys. During World War II, General Montgomery often gathered his subordinates every Saturday afternoon to personally deliver speeches. He was famous for hating smoking. Even the prominent American Wendell Willkie had bumped into his nail because he smoked while eating, so of course none of these listeners dared to smoke anymore, and everyone sat in silence. At this time, General Montgomery would stride to the stage, first without saying a word, staring sternly at the listeners for a minute or two, and then, in an icy tone, he would say: "I will give you two minutes specifically to let you cough and wake up your sniffling. After that, when I speak, it should be quieter."</p>
<p>The listeners were always silent from then on, listening quietly to the training.</p>
<h3>On Panic Buying</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>I happily purchased "The Fate of Mankind" for fourteen yuan and brought it home. I was just lighting a cigarette and planning to read it when my wife, who was counting a few banknotes, spoke up: "I should have bought flour, kerosene, and yarn a long time ago, but I kept delaying it. Now they are even more expensive. People who don't panic buy are destined to suffer!" Hearing this, I couldn't help but put down the book and started to think wildly. After thinking for a while, I felt that people who panic buy are truly enemies of themselves, or at least have no benefit to themselves. Let me briefly discuss it.</p>
<p>According to the newspapers, even embroidered shoes have become targets in the panic buying spree. According to my own observations, people have long been lining up in front of gold shops, wearing through the threshold. The reason for panic buying is nothing more than (1) fear that money is worthless, or (2) that everyone has a lot of money. If it is the former, then the more you panic buy, the more worthless the money will become. For example, if the limited price of woolen cloth was originally one yuan per foot, the shop owner would not dare to raise the price if you didn't panic buy. But if you panic buy, he would at least mix fish eyes with pearls, treating inferior goods as superior goods. At this time, as long as you have goods to buy, you don't care about the quality of the goods. The words of a cigarette peddler that I quoted in my article "A Microscopic View of a Cigarette" are the best explanation: "You can't buy it even if you want to, so who cares if it's moldy?" Indiscriminate panic buying is precisely what promotes the point where money that was originally valuable becomes worthless. I have a pair of pants at home that adults can't wear and children find too big, neither Chinese nor Western. When I oppose my family's panic buying, I use this as a metaphor: when I first bought these pants, I must have thought I was getting a bargain, but looking at it today, although the value of these pants at that time is certainly not worth even a penny in gold yuan, what value do these pants have other than occupying a corner of the drawer? This is talking about unnecessary items. Even daily necessities such as soap, kerosene, and coal briquettes, I do not approve of panic buying. First, how long can what I can panic buy last? Having enough for a year is already a lot, but I always want to live to be eighty years old. Second, for more than ten years, Chinese people have often panic bought things, but none of the people who panic bought have not lived in constant hardship. What good has it done to people who have panic bought a box or two of soap! I think: the gains and losses of panic buyers are as follows:</p>
<p>Gain: Bought a cheap load or box of soap.</p>
<p>Loss: Caused the price of kerosene, matches, grass paper, etc., and even all things, to rise.</p>
<p>Gain: Bought enough of all items for a year, with no fear of rising prices for a year.</p>
<p>Loss: Caused the price of all things to rise for several years thereafter.</p>
<p>(If the items are used up and the person also dies, then of course they have gained an advantage.)</p>
<p>Accordingly, I do not panic buy anything—at most books. Because you can't finish panic buying even if you have money, especially since panic buying can only lead to rising prices, which is like lifting a brick to crush your own feet.</p>
<p>I am making this argument not to show that I, the master, have money and don't care and am speaking cool words, or that I am letting out a Ah Q tantrum. I feel that what Chinese people, from top to bottom, often do is often aimed at selfishness and self-interest, but ends up harming themselves, so I am taking this opportunity to express my views. As for those who really have a lot of money and panic buy things, their foolishness is even more lamentable, and I will continue to discuss it.</p>
<h3>A Study of the Origins of Public Utilities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jian</p>
<p>The development of public utilities is a symbol of a modern city. Today, cities and villages in Europe and America can universally enjoy affordable electricity and water supplies. When these enterprises were first established in China, they were instead severely hindered, and there were many ridiculous facts. Therefore, I will briefly describe the origins of public utilities in Shanghai as follows:</p>
<p>Gas. In the third year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1864), the Shanghai Gas Company was established, and the Municipal Council granted it a permit to lay main pipes underground. The following year, the original oil lamps on the roads in the concession were also converted into gas street lights.</p>
<p>Electric Lights. After using gas lamps for a long time, residents gradually felt that the light was dim and expressed dissatisfaction. In the eighth year of Guangxu (1882), an American named R.W. Little requested permission from the Municipal Council to use street light wooden poles and add more electric poles to test the friction power generation method. In June of that year, Little installed a sample lamp on the high platform of the Bund Park, and viewers all exclaimed its beauty. Later, he requested permission to install electric lights in Chinese homes, the Shanghai Club, and the French Concession. However, electric lights were a novel thing at the time, and were easily met with opposition. The Shanghai Daotai said that electricity was dangerous and could kill people and destroy houses, turning the entire city into a flat ground. Unless electricity was immediately stopped, it would inevitably cause disaster. The gas company also strongly opposed it, fearing that its business would be affected after electric lights were developed. Since then, the two companies competed for many years. Although the electricity business eventually won, gas still has uses in households and industries, so it has been able to maintain its business to this day.</p>
<p>Telephone. In the seventh year of Guangxu (1881), the Great Northern Telegraph Company also operated the Shanghai telephone business. At that time, in addition to the Municipal Council agencies, there were only 338 telephone users in the city.</p>
<p>Tap Water. Shanghai's water supply has always relied on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek. Well water is salty and undrinkable, and river water is dirty and unsuitable. It was not until the sixth year of Guangxu that the Municipal Council contracted with foreign merchants Drysdale Ringer Co. to install water pipes and set up a water tower on Jiangxi Road. In April of the ninth year of Guangxu (1883), water began to be released. At that time, Li Hongzhang was in Shanghai and personally attended the opening ceremony. However, the citizens at that time were half-believing and half-doubting. On the one hand, the company charged water fees, and on the other hand, they did not understand the function of tap water, believing that the water was poisonous, or that the water was electroplated, or even that someone had drowned under the water tower. The Mixed Court was forced to issue a notice to dispel the public's doubts.</p>

<h3>Record of Zhao Shu</h3>
<p>— Peng Yusheng</p>
<p>Zhao Huishu (Zhiqian), in his early years, was so poor he didn't even have an awl to stand on. He once lived in a watchtower on the city walls of Shaoxing. At the time, Miao Wulie (Zi), the governor of Suyang, was an official in the area. One day, he happened to see a Spring Festival couplet made by Zhao. He greatly appreciated it and immediately hired him as a staff member. He also praised him among the high-ranking officials in the capital. As a result, Huishu's calligraphy and paintings of bronze and stone inscriptions became highly sought after, and their value increased tenfold. Many talented people at the time, such as Pan Boyin, Wei Jiashun, and Shen Yunchu, were impressed by his talent and eagerly sought to befriend him.</p>
<p>In the tenth year of Xianfeng, the Taiping army captured Hangzhou, and Wulie died in battle while supervising the defense. General Ruichang requested a posthumous honor, which was approved. However, Governor Wang Youling, relying on his favor, was arrogant and overbearing, and had a long-standing dislike for Wulie. This was because Wulie had once criticized him for not ascending to office through proper channels (Wang was originally a border commissioner who was recognized and promoted by Commander-in-Chief He Guiqing. Within a few years, he was promoted to Jiangsu Provincial Administration Commissioner, and then to Zhejiang Governor.) As a result, he used excuses such as "stubbornly adhering to his own opinions, initiating the idea of defending the city, leading to the fall of the provincial capital, and being unable to escape blame" to request the revocation of Wulie's posthumous honors, in order to vent his anger. Huishu believed that Wulie had indeed died in battle while supervising the defense, and his death was extremely tragic. Moreover, he had served as an official with integrity, achieving great accomplishments. He defended Quzhou, protected western Zhejiang, and his contributions were particularly great. Therefore, he and Shao Xieyuan and others submitted a petition to the Censorate, defending him. Later, after successive appeals by Governor-General Zuo Zongtang, Governor Li Hanzhang, and Provincial Treasurer Jiang Yifeng, the original posthumous honors were finally restored, and he was given the posthumous title "Wulie." Funds were also allocated to build a special ancestral hall for him at Jin Yazhuang in Hangzhou. Sun Yulong, the garrison commander, and Ding Chunhan, the groom, who died in battle at the same time as Wulie, were also enshrined there.</p>
<p>Miao Ziting (Defen), Wulie's son, became an observer in Jiangxi. Huishu was able to serve in the Jiangxi Local Records Bureau with his help. Later, he became the magistrate of Nancheng, where he gained a good reputation. It was said that the Nancheng county office had a snake spirit, and all officials who served there were devout and respectful. Only Huishu did not believe in it, even calling it a demon. Not long after, he died of illness. Elders passed down the story that he died because of the snake, but in reality, he died of typhoid fever.</p>
<p>Huishu's calligraphy and paintings of bronze and stone inscriptions were all exquisite and highly valued by the art world for a long time. His meticulously crafted works were mostly collected by Wulie's descendants. I have more than a thousand of his handwritten letters and more than twenty album leaves and informal notes, which were also dispersed from Wulie's family.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on a Mouse Peeking into the Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Ma Shou</p>
<p>Looking at the Prefaces of the White Flower Collection on the Two Chens</p>
<p>The elder poets of the poetry world have almost all withered away. The graves of the two elders, Sanyuan and Shiyi, are also overgrown with trees. Sanyuan cultivated himself to a very high level in his later years, and his poetic realm was especially simple and natural. The saying "Geng Jie of Yuzhang, a famous tree in the world, spirited and straightforward, meticulous and erudite" can truly be called the best in modern times. Shiyi, on the other hand, sang and danced in the world, having a son and taking a concubine at seventy, symbolizing the lightness and vigor of his poetic pursuits. Compared to Sanyuan, who swam in the great peace, peaceful and content, there was indeed a question.</p>
<p>Compared in an old bookstore, seeing Zhang Mojun's "White Flower Thatched Cottage Poetry Collection," and obtaining the prefaces of the two Chens, the sentiments and styles are different. Sanyuan's work is very concise in its wording, but the meaning is sincere. What he expresses in praise of Mojun is appropriate to her status, and there is no regret. Shiyi's work is not very serious, and comparing Mojun to Shangguan Wan'er is perhaps a little too frivolous. The literary style is also dull, and the allusions are mixed up. It is truly a spontaneous piece of writing. Mojun arranged it after Sanyuan's, and her intention was probably to express some kind of comfort.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is that the two Chens' prefaces write a lot about Mojun's father, Zhang Bochun, and very little about Mojun herself. This is a special style of writing a preface, and it is also the intention of the two elders at the time.</p>
<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>The Ugly Drama of a Clan Society: The Clan Chief Uses Violence to Force Adoption</h3>
<p>To the Editor: My uncle passed away early and had no children. He did not instruct anyone to inherit his estate before his death. This spring, my aunt adopted my cousin as her son and invited the clan chief and local gentry to draw up a contract, requiring my eldest brother to sign it. My eldest brother refused because we have three brothers and he could not make the decision on his own (but he stated that he did not object to my aunt adopting my cousin as her heir). At that time, the clan chief, feeling his dignity was offended, severely beat my eldest brother. The reader and my second brother are doing business in Shanghai and were very upset after receiving the news. I have several questions and would like to ask for your answers: (1) Is it legal for my aunt to adopt my cousin as her heir? (2) Was my eldest brother being unreasonable in refusing to sign due to the difficulty of the situation? (3) Was the clan chief violating the law by using violence and beating him after failing to force him to sign? (4) Can we refuse to recognize my aunt's adoption of my cousin as her heir since we were not notified in advance? Reader, Cao Chun.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Pingfan] (1) Adoption is a remnant of clan society, and there are no provisions for it in the current civil law. According to the law, it cannot be said that your aunt's adoption of your cousin as her son is illegal. (2) It is not necessary for your eldest brother to agree to and sign the adoption of the son. (3) Battery should be responsible for criminal responsibility. (4) No notification is necessary, and it is not necessary for you to recognize it.</p>
