<p>〔本報南京九日電〕美援運用委員會，九日下午三時在政院一號官邸舉行第二次委員會議，出席委員王世杰，王雲五，俞大維，嚴家淦及美援遝用委會副秘書長吳學蘭等多人，最近自美歸來之技術代表團團員李幹亦列席，會議由兼主委翁文灝親自主持，討論歷四小時，關於遝用美援之執行問題及在中央銀行設立特別賬戶問題，均已有且體決定，對於出售物資所得之法幣，是否完全存入中央銀行一點，會中討論尤詳，對於是否允許中國銀行，交通銀行與上海市銀行收轉美援售款一事，亦加以愼重討論，最後決定，出售物資所得之法幣，均全部集中於央行，由央行辦理收存業務，如央行機構不够時，可由央行委託其他國家銀行代為辦理，但所收之款必須立即移轉送入央行，如其他國家銀行因辦理此項收款而增加支出時，可由央行予以貼補，其執行之技術問題，由央行與其他國家銀行商討決定（請參閱另條及中央日報九日社論條）。關於中美雙邊協定第五條所規定，在央行立一特別賬戶問題，決定設立二賬戶，一為特別賬戶，美援物資之價值加運費，乘當時匯率，以美金價値計算折合同等數額之中國貨幣，存入特別賬戶，以備嗣後出售美援物資後，予以抵銷。一為售價收入存戶，出售美援物資所得之款存人此存戶上，此項存款將根據中美雙邊協定，由中美雙方商定動用，中國方面希望大部分凍結，收縮通貨，動用之數目减至最小限度，至凍結若干，將由中美雙方進行商討，現由美雙方對此已進行研究中，十三日聯席會時，將提出討論決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕中央日報九日奢論，抨擊某兩國家銀行及一地方銀行正企圖利用機會緊敗美援，題為「他們將要擊敗美援」。文中指出該行等在美援售款上轉念顯，把美援售款當做普通頭寸來爭取。並謂「他們阻止美援物資出售所得的法幣回籠，而立即支用到市場，最後走到囤積物資之路，如允許他們這樣做，他們手中便有八萬億法幣打轉，則市塲上每天都有八萬億的游資作崇」。該文最後提出三原則盼政院採納，（一）美援售款須直接立解中央銀行。（二）國家銀行不得囤積美援物資。（三）承購美援物資機構或個人，不得向國家銀行低利貸款。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕中央日報九日社論發表後，各方均至注意，　與美援有關方面息：中央日報社論中所指之兩國家銀行及一地方銀行，係指中國銀行，交通銀行及上海市銀行而言，滬民調會配售糧食時，售款會由上述之銀行代中央銀行辦理收存。於三日後將所收之款移轉中央銀行，現滬民調會配售美援糧食，該三行仍要求按過去例代央行辦理，並要求在三日後再將款繳送央行，惟九日美援曾已決定如中央銀行委託其他國家銀行代辦時，所收之售款必須立即移送央行。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕美援運用委員會九日會中，除由李幹報告此次美援貸款商洽經過外，關於美援物資分配及已運抵華數量，曾由嚴家淦作詳細報告。據稱：至八月五日止，以米·麵粉及棉花三項物資為例，其詳細統計數字如下：（一）米·第一期已訂購老為六六八二九長噸，第二期訂購者為二一六九二畏噸，共為八八五二一畏噸，計合一六一七萬六千四百〇八美元，已遝到者為五三六二九長噸，在途中為三九二八長噸，已撥出者為四一五二八長噸，尙存一二一〇七長噸。（二）麵粉·第一期訂購者為八九二九噸，第二期訂購者為八九二九噸，共為一七八五八噸，計値二六七萬九九二〇美元，已運到者為八九三九長噸，在途中者為二四八二長噸，惟麵粉尙未發出。（三）棉花已購訂者為七〇三七八包，計値一二九五萬九三六九美元，現已全部運到。米·麵·棉三項合計共已訂購之物資為三一八一萬五六九七美元，除此以外，尙有已訂購者，但因尙未辦繳款手績，均未計入。肥料·油料已訂購，因未繳款亦有未計入者。關於米，麵·棉花之用途，米已參加配售，棉花除第一期已訂購及已運到者外，第二期已經美經濟合作總署核准訂購者為三三七〇美元，計合十九萬一千一百二十六包，現亦一部已遝到，一部亦在途中，其處理係以花換紗，一包棉紗換花四五三磅，同時再加工繳，其計算辦法正由棉花小胡委會研究中，換來之棉紗，一部將外銷，以換取外匯，另購棉花一部將內銷，以供國內之需要。已撥出之米，以分配於滬市民食調配委員會者為最多，計三九六四五噸，分配於廣州者為一八八三噸，其中有七百噸係由廣州轉分配於汕頭，其配售價格已儘量接近市價，每石為三二〇〇萬元，但一部貧民則按每石二千萬元配售，此項美援糧食，僅足數一部配售之用，中國尙須自籌糧源，糧部頃已在滬成立緊急購儲委員會，由楊綽庵負責主持。</p>
<h3 id="c3">賴樸翰對記者宣稱　美援無地域之分　東北華北情勢不如外傳嚴重　渴望我實施改革計劃 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國經濟台作總署中國分署署長賴樸翰氏，此次在華北·東北各地作十日廣泛而實地之調查後，昨於此問記者招待席上，以堅沉之語調答記者問：「現階段東北及華北之局勢，並非如傳聞中之嚴重。東北情勢，且遠較六月前為進步，衛立煌·傅作義將軍等均極盡職守，而一般抗爭保衛地方之精神，尤為高昂，此種精神，實較武器更屬重要。」</p>
<p>據稱：此行對東北前途之工業機會，印像殊屬深刻。華北尤為中國之重要地土，亦屬工業中心區域。觀察所得，一般認為局墊嚴重後，政府將放棄東北·華北之觀念，實屬不確。傅·衛兩將軍於洽談間，曾希望增加軍事援助，惟此點已越出個人負責工作範圍以外，但深信美國對軍事援華之分配工作，必有極民主之決定。</p>
<p>賴氏昨日復一再强調，美援四億元，均係美國納稅人所捐獻，目前中國確需美援，惟美國需明瞭該項美援是否已獲妥善之運用。預定計劃是否可逐步兌現。個人認為中國需要改革之點仍多，例如納稅制度即其一端，故期望至來冬時，雖不能獲覩全盤改革，克底於成，惟至少需有已開始改革之跡象，俾合作總署長霍夫曼於向國會報告時，能列舉事寳，說明中國政府如何運用該項美援，以保障中國之獨立與主權。　此次援華之二億七千五百萬美元，總署並無義務將款全部用聲，此筆款項，性質係屬貸給而非贈予，故除非該款用途正當，總署將隨時中止支用，至出售美援物資所得之法幣，亦需獲得總署之同意後，方能作有效之運用，至如何運用該款，對正研究辦性中。</p>
<p>賴氏聲明，渠並不擬批評中國政府，且此亦非渠之職責，然中國政府對種種改革，亦並不反對，惜各種改革計劃現均在停頓狀態中。故渴望有所動作表現。此次美援二億七千五百萬美元中，個人對史蒂爾曼所提之報告雖不欲討論，惟六千萬元經建專款及一千萬元材科零件補充經費，本人曾於二週前與行政院翁院長洽談一過，認為尙可增加一千萬元，使各地工廠可以補充或修復。總之，美援協助中國工業復興，固不僅在華南·華中，而將管及全國。</p>
<h3 id="c4">杜魯門總統批准　軍火接濟我國　勃里奇指責拖延過久 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八月八日電〕參議員勃里奇八日宣稱：杜魯門總統業已批准海陸空軍總部於一億二千五百萬元之軍事援華計劃下，運輸車火中國。杜氏致渠信中明白指出，此種援助，並非美國顯為中國政策負責之謂。</p>
<p>勃氏指賣杜魯門採取「故意」而「不可寬怒」，「停滯及拖延」政策，使蘇聯得於遠東伸展其勢力。接白氏乃共和黨黨員，現任撥款委員會主席，為主張援助中國蔣總統之有力份子。</p>
<p>渠稱：至目下為止，一億二千五百萬元之援華金，已撥下者僅九百萬元——或總數之十四分之</p>
<p>杜魯門致勃氏信內稱：「余已下令屬防部長，協助中國政府獲得此項軍用品之接濟。」又稱：「陸長總雅爾及作戰計劃部長總德邁中將所提之援華計劃大綱，當局將予以「適當的考慮」。彼等之意見已提交參衆兩院之發款委員會。「此計劃下之援助。不能解釋為美國將為中國政府之政策·作為或一切隨時可發生的情事負責」。</p>
<p>勃氏指出若中國不能前往美國陸軍海軍或其他政府機關獲取物資與軍大，則將使「費用甚鉅而效率甚戰」，蓋中國必須派員同美國工廠獲取也。</p>
<p>消息靈通方面認為勃氏之意見，預示共和黨若於十一月大選中獲勝，必將擴大援華計劃。</p>
<p>勃氏特別指責杜魯門於「國會通過援華計劃後，擱置四月，始作第一次之交付」。又謂：杜魯門之措施，顯與國會相牴觸，且其政策「不能以任何語言說明其為兩黨政治之政策」。勃氏末稱：「余希望一種新的政策已在中國開始實行，余更希望過去當局對中國拖延政策至此宣告終止」</p>

<h3 id="c19">通貨膨脹與鈔禁荒 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>上週四行二局連日大量差出，總數達十七餘萬億，銀根鬆濫，暗息下降；但是市上現鈔仍感匱乏，向行莊領取現鈔，凡在三億以上者，均須搭本票，貼水已昻至一角左右，甚至漢口因鈔荒益加嚴重，武昌鄂省銀行無鈔付現，竟被提款者兩度搗毀。其他都市亦有同樣情形發生，這不能不說是目前經濟界的一個矛盾現象。</p>
<p>通貨旣然膨脹，銀根又極鬆濫，何以鈔票會荒？這事粗看雖很奇特，但其理由却極簡單。因為通貨膨脹，抬高了一般物價水準，同時即提高了籌碼的需要，而且據官方表示：現在物價的漲度，遠過於發鈔的倍數，所以通貨愈膨脹，鈔票愈不够用。此其一。</p>
<p>所謂通貨的範圍，原不止現貨一種，如各種流通的票據，均屬現貨的代用品。在平時，此項代用品的授受，减少了現貨許多的用途和壓力，並且增加了民間不少的便利和携帶。只為現在通貨過於膨脹了，當局為緩和此項膨脹的情勢起見，故意縮小此等票據的用途，如禁止當日抵用，取締開發本票等等，於是向來可以代用的範圍日益縮小，市面上所需要的鈔票，就不得不隨之增多了。此其二。</p>
<p>各地金融的流通，原以滙兌為唯一的正當辦法，現在却也以通貨膨脹，資金逃避的緣故，不能不多設限制，以期防止，於是許多內滙；不得不梱載現鈔以資代替，自此現鈔的需要，益發加强了。此其三。</p>
<p>因為內滙不能自然調整的結果，兩地之間的滙水，發生了高度的差額·如自申滙穗，每千萬元到彼處只能拿到五百五十萬元，於是一般有手面的，便多方設法，運現到粵，再由粵滙滬，期於一轉手間，獲取近乎對本的暴利，而當地現鈔却不免為此輩搬運一空了。此其四。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹，旣抬高了物價，則欲拉住物價，又不得不扣緊通貨，以期收縮銀根。近來現鈔之所以奇缺，與貼水之所以日高，其中未必無人為作用，從中抑揚，期為將發未發的眞正大鈔留一地步。此其五。</p>
<p>上海本是發鈔的中樞，無論是國外所代印，或國內所自印，各種鈔票，皆須由此間中央銀行發出。所謂「近水樓台先得月」，論理上海不應發生鈔票荒的現象。但以上述各種形勢，愈逼愈緊，此等現象，亦居然由內地漸漸傳染到上海，除了驚人的貼水以外，長蛇陣似的排隊領鈔，與無理由的折扣應付，使金融界與工商界深切地感到痛苦；尤其是一般薪工階級，每屈發薪，多半要搭發相當的本票，支票，使他們於柴米日用之間，也發生許多麻煩。此等現象，關係民生疾苦太深，影響整個市面也太大，當局實未可過於忽視！</p>
<p>當局發行大鈔的計劃，早經正式宣佈，且已局部實施，現在鈔荒情形，旣如此嚴重，應該已達到了瓜熟蒂落的時候了吧。假如百萬元與五百萬元的新鈔，源源問世，暢行市面，相信上述種種困難情形，不難望其逐漸解除。我們所懸念的，是鈔票的流通額愈多，則物價的底碼不能不隨之增高，因而所需要的籌碼，亦不能不隨之隨多，在這等過程之中，如果陳陳相因，沒有澈底的改變，則經過相當期間以後，鈔票又將奇缺，而更大額的鈔票又將成為必要了。似此互為因果，循環演變，不知鈔票荒的情形，究到何日始可眞正消滅？亦不知幾多額的鈔票纔是最後的大鈔？</p>
<p>歸根一句總話：政府如果不下最大決心，趕快使收支平衡，而拋開藉增發通貨以彌補赤字的念頭，如果再不設法使中央銀行的發行權受社會的監督而宣告不受財部的支配，那麼，此種惡性循環將愈趨愈烈，而無可遏止。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日合衆電〕經濟合作總署高級官員謂：為數二億七千五百萬美元之經濟援華款項，除由中國直接使用外，且可間接用以恢復日本貿易，彼等絕對不承認懷有建議日本使其恢復戰前工業國地位之意，但强調中國於復原工作中如能利用日本工業，則將受益匪淺。除棉花以外，中國所需之工業物品，均可取目遠東，及美國以外其他地方。經濟合作總署已悄然自中國分署中派兩人赴日，作初步調查。據悉：日本將自中國裝遝煤斤（大部為開　煤）及鐵砂，而以日本在佔領之下所建設之工業設施之零件，以及粵漢路之零件及設備，供給中國。日後日本且將以物品供給中國，如不自美國而自日本方面取得貨品，則將較為經濟。日本工業將輔助中國建設至何種程度，須視經濟合作總署駐華建設調查團員選定之中國計劃而定，消息靈通人士謂：經濟合作總署正鄭重考慮，以開　煤供給日本。供給日本之鐵，將大部分取自長江附近日本所遺留之存鐵。經濟合作總署官員謂：此政策與在歐所採取促進東西方貿易之工作相同，該政策且將與盟總之計劃配合，以使日本獲得美元，以購美棉。</p>

<p>〔又電〕共和黨衆議員周以德於接見記者時稱：「中國一旦擺脫其對共產主義及侵略之憂懼，即將願意與日本恢復貿易關係」。周氏發表是項言論，係於經濟合作總署宜佈希望在中國重建計劃內，包括捉進日本工業之部份之後。渠謂：「中國人對於美國援助其舊日敵國日本之款額，甚感不安。彼等感覺吾人加諸侵略者之優惠，尤甚過加諸於盟國者，此亦未始不無理由。惟戰前之貿易形式，被認為係對於繁榮整個東方之經濟，為一絕對必要者」。渠解釋謂：「日本欲維持其人民生活，即無法擺脫其與中國之關係，同時中國需要戰前日本所出產之大批廉價貨物。倘吾人能助中國戰敗共產黨軍隊，結束摧毀其經濟之內戰，及助其免於侵略之恐懼，則中國必可恢復其與日本及其他遠東國家之貿易關係。故一切努力，未為晚也。」渠並謂：「日本前途之成敗，端視中國之發展。倘中國淪入共產黨之手，吾人欲求不再為日本傾竭美國國庫，亦不可能也。」周氏謂：渠認為日本工業水準之數字，應較戰前略高。蓋日本人已增加，且須從事龐大之復興工作，以前所規定之日本工業水準，僅能使日本人民，維特生存。至於日本之作戰潛能，實遠較德國之作戰潛能易於控制。蓋日本缺乏原料，且易遭受孤立，周氏主張對日本隊入之鐵砂及鋼等，加以嚴厲管制，俾作為對日作戰潛能之有效控制。渠復認為美國應逕自穩定日圓之價値，母需等待其他國家之同意。周氏並謂：目前並非促使締結日本和約之適當時刻。　目前吾人須應付之事項極多。渠認為非待柏林局勢解決後，其他國家并無企岡完成日本和約之心意。周以德復謂：中日兩國日後或將在多種工業品方面，被此激烈戰爭。但兩國在中國完成工業化之過程中，　將互相輔助，而並不眞正競爭。周氏並希望中國本身强盛，拋棄目前之恐懼及拒絕心理，則此種情形方能實現。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播莫斯科訊　：英美法三國專使九日下午五時（標準時間下午二時）再度訪晤蘇外長莫洛托夫，商談德國大局。此為英美法外交官與莫洛托夫之第三次會談，會談情形仍嚴守秘密。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播；四强再度召開會議雖已　露曙光，但英美法三國政府若干有勢力人士深恐東西兩方對德國問題終難獲致協議而表示悲觀。彼等所希望者，至多為一種緩衝計劃，或可防止大局惡化至引起世界戰禍之地步。此　熊度實基於下列數種事實：（一）西方列强決不自願放棄德國，任其變成蘇聯之另一衛星國。（二）蘇聯鑒於統一之德國或將加入西方以抗東方，故亦決不願放棄德國東部。（三）德國處於東西兩强爭持下，除繼續保持分裂之狀能外，別無第三條出路。實則東西兩方所爭執者，無非為要控制整個德國耳。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕外交界八日談稱：蘇聯恐四强外長會議或行使　幕內之裂痕趨於明顯，此項憂慮或為目前莫斯科東西談判所以遲緩之原因。傳美大使史密斯法大使夏台岳及英專使羅伯茲等已接獲各該國政府之新訓令。關於莫斯科談判之一切均係揣測性質，但衆信蘇聯或擬放寬外長會議之議程，足以討論蘇聯所願討論之問題，同時又擯除或將使蘇聯窘迫不安之任何問題。所謂窘迫不安之問題，計有恢復奧國獨立之和約，特港歸返義大利問題，及德波未來疆　問題。據稱，特港未來問題及恢復奧國獨立之問題如加以討論，則共產情報局與南斯拉夫狄托元帥問更趨嚴重之分裂，顯將成為一項因數。同時在德國廣泛問題上任何決定中，蘇聯一方面有贏取德國友誼之願望，一方面又需允許以德波現行臨時疆界為永久疆界之波蘭要求。西方盟國曾建議以特港歸返義大利，狄托反對此舉，蘇聯如同意於此，則義共產之塊位將大為加强。至於對奧國問題而言，狄托曾要求奧國之賠償，蘇聯或認為支持奧國對已有利，但如此則蘇聯將使狄托與共產情報局問之糾紛更惡化。</p>

<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（原文載八月十七日出版的美國「觀察雜　」）</p>
<p>史達林的私生活被包圍在一重鐵慕後而。他有三個孩子，其中兩個—雅谷勃和斯維蘭娜—同樣也受這位獨裁者的保護，對外保持秘密的。可是他那廿八歲的孩子伐雪萊偏偏愛拋頭露面，耽溺於　華生活和公開的醜行，這是共產黨所最忌諱的一種行為。</p>
<p>伐雪萊·史達林是一個嬌養的，傲慢的頑童。他的行為不像是一個職業性無產階級的兒子，倒像是一個舉止豪華的王子。蘇聯的報紙有時把他描繪成一位勇男武的空軍英雄，企圖掩飾他的頑皮的行為。可是在被他出賣的朋友，被他引誘的婦女，在酒肉徵逐時被他扣押的人們的眼裏，他決不是一位英雄。</p>
<p>祝新生酣舞終宵</p>
<p>年輕的伐雪萊·史達林生於一九二〇年，是他父親的繼室——年輕美貌的亞麗呂伐——所生的。那時她剛畢業於高等學校，比她的丈夫年輕廿一歲。在湯餅宴會中，史達林跟着他的親友們豪飮狂舞，毫無倦色。後來，據他的一位朋友新聞記者拉台克所講述的，他一時情感奔放，竟拔出手槍朝着窗外開放。可是歲　飛逝，不數年後他對於他兒子的熱愛漸漸冷下去了。這孩子不　歡書本，在學校裏成績低劣，而且常常惡作劇，弄得他的敎師們啼笑皆非，毫無辦法，對於這個一國元勳的孩子不敢責罰他。伐雪萊每天坐着汽車上學校去，坐在課桌後面兀是坐立不安，只等散學的時刻到來，那時他又可以躲到汽車裘去了——這是他所最心愛的一件東西。</p>
<p>史達林原希望他的兒子將來能够傳他的衣鉢，或至少會變成一位政府要員，現在看了這一切情形，他的希望都成泡影了。所以當伐雪萊突然對飛行術發生興趣時，他眞喜出望外了。一九三九年他從學校裏畢業以後，他的父親就准許他踏上飛行家的危險生涯。現在伐　萊已長成一位瘦長中等身材，濃髮的靑年，酷肖他父親的許多照片。鼻頭，低額角和濃重的頭髮無一不像他的父親。他在航空學校　依然忽視理論，大胆地表演各種危險的空中演習。</p>
<p>一九四一年他畢業於航空學校，得空軍少尉銜，同時被派在北方前綫一戰鬥機部隊喪服務。現在整個世界似乎展開在他的面前了，他立刻　到了成功，事業和權勢的風味了。他眼見他的上司不願派他去祖任作戰任務，顯然是怕他發生意外時會傷他父親的心，他於是要求派充司令的職務。他被指派率領十八架戰鬥機的飛行中隊　同時有一位專家充他的助手）。從那時起，他的職位便逐漸升高了。</p>
<p>露頭角濫使職權</p>
<p>同時，從那時起，這位年輕的司令官漸漸摹倣他父親擺出小獨裁者的架子來。他不管職位的高低，常常為了些瑣細的事由叱　年長的空軍官員，下手諭懲戒他們，任意拘捕人們，大聲呼喝，打着高級司令官們所　用的恐嚇語調：「你要到西伯利亞去嗎？」但是實際的作戰行動都由那位謙恭的助手指揮，他耐心地聽取他長官的命令，然後照目已的意思為必要的措置。可是伐　來的上司們為了討好大獨裁者，照樣給那靑年軍官晉級加俸並頒給各糧　章。</p>
<p>一九四四年他的肩上已經掛上上校的肩章。九個月後，空軍元帥諾維可夫把一張任命他兒子做將軍的命令遞呈史達林簽字，那時伐雪萊還沒有到二十四歲。可是他的父親沒有簽署那張命令。他决心使他野心的兒子棄邪歸正，同時要敎訓那輩以過分的謟媚縱容他兒子的軍官們。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日合衆電〕美第八十屆國會中爭執甚劇之議員，均已回返家園。杜魯門則傳已草擬聲明，　責渠等不贊同渠之立法項目之行為。歷時十三日之國會特別會議七日晚於歷年來政治上爭執最烈之高潮中，通過性質溫和之反通貨膨賬及房屋問題之法案後休會。　　對工資及物價管制及配給權之要求則未予通過。</p>
<p>權威行政當局方面稱，杜魯門將勉强簽署共和黨之物價及房屋問題法案，並將於本週初發表聲明，攻擊該法案等為不合時宜者。總統是否將親自答覆或由其他民主黨員答覆參議員富格森提出之彈劾總統之恫嚇，現尙不得而知，一般揣測，杜魯門將保持　默，按當格森於參院中曾譴責總統拒絕予國會有關聯邦公務人員之檔案，而使立法人員居於無法忍受之境况，蓋渠等將盲目立法或　使杜魯門就其行為提出答覆也。</p>

<p>關於八月份水電價格問題，記者曾走訪閘北水電公司，華商電氣公司，浦東電氣公司，內地自來水公司等各負責人，綜合其談話情形如下：公用事業以服務巿民為前提，受法律規定原無暴利可能。際此國家社會經濟已至山窮水盡之境，各公司更不能存非份之想，俾求收入可敷再生產之用，於願巳達。但每次調整水電價格，被公用局一再核减，虧蝕之鉅，積欠　深。最近自六月份起，情形更形惡化，茲分析各公司困難原因如下：一·六月起生活指數劇增。二·結匯辦法變更證明　價格直綫上漲。三·燃料價格逐月劇漲。四·水電係先用後付，月初公布之價格，事實上須俟下月上旬左右始可陸續收集。實際幣値有時僅及調整時十之二三。因以上原因，使各公司資金短絀，無法周轉，過去差額尙小，尙有政府貸款，可資挹注。近日短糾之數，日漸鉅大，而貸款均在數千億元以上，無源源供給之可能。約計七月份各公司收支不敷，計：閘北水電公司為四千二百五十六億元。　商電氣公司為一千二百四十五億元。浦東電氣公司為一千六百六十億元。內地自來水公司為一千五百另四億元。所有股息折舊等，均尙未計入，實已無法維持下月再生產之用。至八月份公布之價格，按諸實際，仍有不敷之處，如本市供電數量最巨之上海電力公司，依照八月份核定電價收費，聞預計不敷，仍在二萬億元以上。華商各公司估計收支不敷之數如下：一·閘北水電公司不敷一萬億元以上。二·華商電氣公司不敷二千〇三十二億元。三·浦東電氣公司不敷三千四百六十億元。四·內地自來水公司不敷二千二百億元。目前各公司對於必須器材已無力購置，將來效率减低，無法避免，如八月份核定水電售價設再有所變動，則周轉益感困難，充其結果，各公司製水發電，其勢祗能視收入多寡而定。維持供給之短長，其或有不能繼續維持之可能，其數重後果不堪想做云·</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕由於惡性通貨膨脹的結果，黃金與美鈔之為大衆追求收　已為　人皆知之事，等而下之，打入冷宮十餘載的銀幣也從新在繁華世界中現其色相了。</p>
<p>政府雖然明令禁止銀元　　，但正如金鈔黑市之始終無法根絕一樣，銀元市塲的存在亦為母　　書的事實。在南京，據說銀元　賣已成公開的行為，上海為全國金融中心，當局執法較嚴，銀元市塲乃以一種半公開的姿態出現，俗　所謂「開一隻眼，閉一隻眼」，彷彿類之。</p>
<p>本市銀幣市塲產生的歷史約有半年光景，其起源據內中人談，係因當時漢口一帶許多交易都用銀元為單位，對銀幣需求甚殷，就有些單帮客到上海來搜購，他們與老北門一帶擺售銀器地擬的攤販接觸，轉輾收售，從而就產生出一批　客身份的「黃牛」，他們買進也賣出，從差額間博取利潤，其交易就在馬路上進行，慢慢地遠近皆知，蔚然成市了。</p>
<p>人行道上等侯顧客</p>
<p>除了老北門口的河南路上是銀元市塲的大本營外，河南路天津路　波路之間以及四馬路杏花樓附近，有時亦有「黃牛」「拓荒」其間，不過那　是少數而已。從事這項生意的「黃牛」，估計約有數百人之多，他們三五成羣，從早晨七點多鐘起，就站在人行道上等候顧客，一直要到下午七點多鐘才歸去·他們身邊大都僅携　少數銀　興法幣，大批的貨色則審　在附近住戶中，以免被抄沒收。當興顧客議定數量價格之後，就囑顧客稍候，一方面馬上到家中將銀幣或鈔票取來，交換的地點則路幾條里弄之內以避　　耳目。</p>
<p>妓院樓上騙款潛逃</p>
<p>不過在上午九點以前，下午五點以後，大抵很少有警察前往巡邏，這時候他們就會堂而　之的在馬路上交易。一天之中交易最盛的時間大約在上午九十點鐘，像現在炎夏天氣，下午一二點鐘最為清　。如果是巨額進出，在路上或里弄中不便交換的，顧客可以囑他們送到指定地點，或者跟他們到儲藏處所去論交，可是在後一種情形，　　客必須身為「老舉」，否則戚有被騙被搶的危險。前幾天就有一位外埠來的　銀幣客人被兩個「黃牛」帶到一家妓院樓上，收了法幣後假稱到樓下取貨，結果　　人竟先後溜走了。</p>
<p>香港有人專收袁頭</p>
<p>進　出的銀幣有所謂「大頭」「小頭」「龍洋」「　洋」之分。「大頭」又稱「袁　」，即是　袁世凱像的銀元，「小頭」又稱「孫頭」，是鑄孫總理像的銀元。「大頭」的價格稍高於「小頭」，據說在香港有人專收銀元，並且指定要有袁世凱頭的，因此「袁頭」身價就高於「孫頭」了。除此兩種之外，尙有「龍洋」「鷹洋」，但因流通數量甚微，成為「不吃香」的冷門貨，無論賣出，價格都要打一七折。</p>

<h3 id="c99">夏都廬山鎮面目 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　劉問趨</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日航訊〕廬山彷彿是一個闊人家的花園。但這闊人家正發生着艱困之感，他雖則有了自己的花園，却拿不出足够的錢來予以適度的培養。</p>
<p>廬山管理局直屬江西省政府，省政府所能供應的只是很少的經費，冬天够維持，夏天不好辦。每到夏季，便要由中央補助。管理局長王作民今春上山就任之初，費了好大力量，弄到二十億，經營了今年的夏都。三個月之前，二十億還值錢，可以買點東西作點事。舉一個例，王作民買了大批柴油上山，使發電廠可以供電三個月。</p>
<p>巧媳難為米吹</p>
<p>管理局的主任秘書吿訴我，廬山主要工作是治安，淸潔和交通。一百多人的警察所和另外一個憲兵連，維持廬山的安全；管理局養了一批淸道夫，維持淸潔；二千名轎夫支持了山上山下的交通。這些事都是要花錢的，此外該作的事並不是沒有，但是巧媳婦難為無米炊。</p>
<p>戰前曾享盛名的廬山醫院，現在屬於九江醫院，是山上唯一的醫療機構。因為沒有經費，成了避暑醫院。夏天開張，冬天關門。器械·設備。醫藥·一切都因陋就簡。丁貴堂的兒媳跳樓受傷，山上連一副石膏床都沒有，只得抬到九江醫院去求治。僅有的二十張病床，被肺病患者住滿了；每天上坡下坡登門求治的，都是些衣衫襤褸的老百姓。</p>
<p>這裏的銀行在鬧着鈔荒。</p>
<p>除了江西省銀行因為代理省庫終年開業外，其他銀行都是為服務避暑客而來，只在山上營業三個月。中國·中國農民·上海商業儲蓄三家已經開張了。中央·交通也在籌備。他們大抵作匯兌和存款業務。山上是花錢的地方，匯入多，匯出少，存戶也大多是匯進時存入，慢慢提出。因此銀行的任務只是供應鈔票。最近一週來，牯嶺現鈔奇缺，可以供應牯嶺的九江·南昌也在閙鈔荒，銀行負責人為了現鈔急得團團轉。上海銀行派了專人下山，要四十億，祗給了五億。一個外國老太婆只取一千六百萬，還要跑上兩三趟。中央，交通兩行據說已籌備就緒，因為沒有現鈔，不敢上山開業。</p>
<p>據說，由上海電匯牯嶺的匯水曾高達三成。</p>
<p>銀行出去的現鈔收不回來，錢那裏去了？有人說，錢都換了銀元。於是鈔票大批下山，分散到九江，南昌，廣東。一丙遝來，一面運走，鈔票旅行愈快，人們愈顯得窮困。</p>
<p>牯嶺去春大火毀了元氣，到今年還禾恢復。正街，新街，下街，殘跡宛然。廢墟中重建起的舖　，從金店到小吃食店，固然無一不全，但沒有較大規模的。</p>
<p>主要的營業是飯館，但都冷冷淸淸。金店有兩家，一家正修理門面準備開張，另一家已營業了，前幾天還鬧了一回售金成色不足的事。洋貨店價錢比上海要貴二三成乃至七八成。景德鎮的瓷器價錢驚人，一套吃飯吃茶用具大大小小一百九十餘件，售價一億多。哪啡店夥計閒得坐在櫃合上打瞌睡，傢具店的工作也淸淡得很。</p>
<p>文化事業呈凋象</p>
<p>精神食糧銷路缺缺，三家書店，其中一家專售上海的新書刊。能銷的雜誌不過三五十本，書籍的銷路則寥寥無幾。商務印書館擺在社會服務處裏面，一天祗能賣幾百萬元，書價大槪比上海貴二，三成。</p>
<p>每犬能看到的報紙，祗有九江型報，前年中央日報和力行日報廬山版，去年的廬山報，都成為值得回憶的往事。九江型報對開一張，用土紙印刷，每天下午可以到牯，祗有七十份的銷路，南昌的中國新報和民國日報因須隔日看到，銷路更少。京滬報紙還無法在這裏看到。</p>
<p>山上沒有娛樂塲所，僅有的一家跳舞廳裏，留聲機送出流行歌曲，跳舞的人寥寥無幾。游泳池開放了，水太冷，祗有一些外國人下水。</p>

<p>中國籃球隊方法尚差</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦九日電〕世運籃球賽中，最不易被忘却之一，當推中國與韓國交戰之一塲。世運所有籃球賽，均於倫敦北部室內運動場名哈林蓋者舉行，內座位舒適，可容觀衆一萬一千人。籃球於英國尙未成為衆所愛好之運動，故此運動場觀衆罕有塡滿座位十分之一以上者，然自世運籃球賽開始以來，觀衆已日見增加。當中國與韓國比賽籃球時，觀衆人數約在一千五百與二千名之間。</p>
<p>此戰與前兩次對比利時對智利之戰相較，中國隊已在下列方面獲有進步，第一，罰球中的之成數大增。第二，當時間與情勢愈來愈緊時，能鞏屆後防。韓人得球後，我隊退守，輒取鬆弛之五人位置防守法，韓人則不斷以迅捷二人聯絡法破入，此即一人拍球盤旋前衝，至無可再進時，則反身擲球與第二人，後者得球，即行投籃。此聯絡法使五人防守之陣營錯亂，致第二人往往不復受我監視。韓人投籃於是四有三中，每俟中國隊得分接近韓隊至相差三五分時，韓人即又以脫兎之勢，投入一二球。當情形益顯危急之際，我隊乃棄鬆弛之五人防守法，而以「監視你的人」為口號，於是韓人之企圖，始吿受挫。</p>
<p>吾人雖勝韓國，個別表現之球藝　佳，而聯絡傳遞方面，有待改進之處則甚多，吾人行動　綏，致使敵隊得逞奪回籃球，並鞏固其防禦，吾人尙無任何方法或系統能突破五人之防守法。迄今為止，吾人過於仰賴於駐足遞球，以及無濟於事之投籃。第一僅徒形消耗時間，第二為困難重重，以上為翌晚以五一對三十二敗於菲列賓之實際原因。菲列賓隊全隊聯絡工作，優於吾隊，彼等有一規定之系統與方法，兩者均為可攻可守，吾人在短促之時間仍可在此一方面，獲致改善。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：中國籃球隊在此次大會比賽中，與韓國同隸一組，同得八分，而且中國還擊敗過韓國，但是韓國現在列於前八名內，而中國即使在第三部淘汰賽節節勝利，也頂多得到第十七名。這是一個例千，足以證明在現行的比賽制度中，命運左右一切。</p>
<p>在兩星期內，要判別廿多個球隊的高下，無疑的是一件難事。這次的循環淘汰制，比較稍為完備，結果還是不行，中國的犧牲便是一個例子。有不少國家以為命運在這個制度中的決定性，比在雙淘汰制中所表現的還要重大。</p>
<p>國際業餘籃球協會自經一九三六年採用雙淘汰失敗後，即着手研究，希望能够得到一個比較理想公平的比賽制度，使比賽在可能範圍內，達到最公允的地步，但是，十二年的探討，仍歸失敗。</p>
<p>因此，大會代表和國際業餘籃球協會的理事，已定今（十）日召開聯席會議，討論一九五二年下屆世運會預備採用的比賽方法。完美的比賽制度，當然不可能在雙小時內產生，今日之會，禁作原則上之探討，枝節細則，當有待籃協之作再深切之　討。籃球規則的修改，來適合美國的快速制度，以及犯規等等，也將是會議中議程之一。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　鍾震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦特約通訊）七月廿五日（星期日），記者於極度的匆忙中，由法京搭八時〇五分快車，橫渡英倫海峽，於下午四時四十分抵達。倫敦維多利亞車站。站中到處可見到世界運動會的廣吿招貼，及歡迎各國選手們色彩鮮艷奪目的旗幟，使這古老陳舊的車站，平空增添了一番更新的氣象。在倫敦中心區最熱閙的畢凱狄廣塲（Ficcadily　Circus）上高矗的（Cupid）愛神的銅像四週，也都懸滿着參加世界運動會的彩色旗幟。難得在國外見到的靑天白日旗，也居然迎風招展，飄揚在英倫的領空，使國人見了非常興奮。路上不斷地可遇見穿着制服由各國拔選來的選手們，到英的旅客，也驟然增加數倍以上。倫敦大街上擠滿了五色繽紛外籍的旅客，旅館十九都高懸客滿牌，所有的店舖，均營業興隆，利市萬倍。可是除掉奢侈品能自由無限量的出售外，一切日用品和食品，依然統制得非常嚴厲，所以其價格並未受了世遝的影饗狂升疾漲，而使物質困乏境况下之英倫市民，倍覺痛苦。</p>
<p>中國代表國的辦事處，是設在「梅白阿其」（Marble　Areh）的皇家飯店（Mount　Royel　Hotel），選手宿舍則在較為僻靜的倫敦市南部（Kilburn）保利派克路（Priory　Park　Road）的一所保利合克尼克學校（Kilburn　PolitechnicSchool）。該校為五層樓的新式洋房，棕色人造石的門面，屋頂懸有奧林匹克會旗和一而巨大中國國旗，頗覺莊嚴樸茂。門外擁滿了由於好奇心所驅使，等候着選手們簽名的英國兒童。該樓之地下室闢為餐廳，一層樓為會議室，（因目前在皇家飯店之辦公室已取消）及會客室，室內正中懸巨幅國旗，檯上放滿了英國旅行社的宣傳品。自二層樓至五層樓均為選手們之臥室，約十餘人一間，小鐵牀分成二行，排列整齊美觀。選手們的營養不生問題，因事先已由國內運去大批杜米，火腿，醬菜，皮蛋，麻菇等類的食品，且大會也備有中國廚司，每日供應精美可口之中國菜者。選手們之生活極有紀律，每日淸晨必乘車赴練習場練習，日間去該處練習或觀摩他國選手練習及別隊的比賽，每晚十一時以前必歸宿舍，使選手們得有充份之休息。故選手均精神飽滿，情緒興奮。</p>
<p>外人對我之選受也頗敬重，因谷項運動雖未正式入選獲分，然均認中國選手之成績，並不惡劣，尤其對於中國籃球輝煌之戰繢，稱賞不已。我國之足球隊雖出馬即遭慘敗，然敗於向稱譽於歐洲之土耳其之手，也頗得人之原諒。而在七月二十六日下午五時於奧克斯勃里奇球塲與高大精銳之美世運隊作友　比賽時之戰續，尤足為世人贊揚。該塲比賽也出售門票，上半時美國隊迎進二球，使新大陸的健兒們，喜於形色，後為我國左翼何應芬扳回一球，造成一比二，上半時吾國略吿小挫。下半時吾國隊合力猛攻，由中鋒朱永强特出奇射，進一球，成二比一之和局。吾國健兒精神更為一振，猛戰多時，何應芬又進一球，結果三比二反敗為勝。在國外初試牛刀，即擊敗優秀之美國隊，輿論紛紛，均以為中國足球頗有希望，豈知天不助人，兩次抽簽，均遇土耳其。僑胞對選手們熱烈的擁護，認為祖國經過十數年之戰神浩刦，目前又面臨著新的經濟恐慌，及種種的艱難，却以絕大的決心，在財力物力均感缺乏下，毅然決然的召開戰後第一次全國運動大會，來選拔世運的選手，是件多麼令人感覺與奮的。此次雖未能載譽而歸然已給予外人留下一良好之印象。且此次由觀摩研究所得之經騐，已足以為他日促進我國運動之張本。希望四年後下一屆之世運會中，我國之成績，能跟着時代輪子並進，揚眉吐氣，為祖國爭光。</p>

<p>— 白永</p>
<p>除去幾本藏書之外，大約可以說是一貧如洗。雖然古詩人常以有書不為貧之類的話表現阿Q精神，然煮字不可療飢，事到緊急，只好飽聽妻孥的怨　。</p>
<p>隨園詩話裏似有幾條說到貧窮與買書的佳句天氣這樣熱，沒有勇氣去翻檢，而我記詩句的本領又最不行。只燱得袁氏自己曾有句：「熟遠愁過市，家貧夢買書」，這感觸倒很切實，一直到現在還是如此。有人把書比作食糧，其實這兩種頗有本質的差異，餓到極點，草根樹皮觀音土都可以充飢，但書却不能如此遷就，寧可不看，也不能拿嘔氣的劣品消遣，凡是有讀書癖好的人，大約全有尊重自己興趣的傾向，這是不容諱言的。所以，如有好書而不能買，的確要「寤寐思服」。如此歲月，白報紙的價錢幾乎漲了兩千萬倍，老　們第一是不肯印書，第二是不肯低價賣書，市塲上所反映的是量的貧乏和購買力的薄弱，書價儘管三天一漲五天一改，可是書店門可羅雀，空有貨色，掉不進籍碼，也是枉然。於是作夢的只好永遠作夢，蝕本的也無從補充，我們作夢也得不到的東西，正是他們無論如何也脫不了手的存貨。「約翰·克利斯朶夫」和「娜娜」在棧房裏暗泣，靑年學子則害單相思，即此一點，亦足以說明萬事之不合理。</p>
<p>藏書如今也成問題。首先是房子，上海論金條，南京及其他城市講白米，我們絕沒資格花一石五斗的給書租一間屋，只好讓他們在臥室委屈一下。其次是書架，最蹩脚的玻璃橱也得五千萬，一具竹架或柳條架也得過千萬，我們有時連床舖都成問題，那有給他們謀一席之可能。旣是這些全談不到，還够得上藏書嗎？眞是寒傖　人！</p>
<p>然而老鼠和蛀虫却不饒人，一部三希堂法帖把末册吃個精光，也許是作了鼠少爺的襁褓了，幸而留情，沒有從中間一册挖個大洞。癸已類稿和存稿的書報織滿了虫網，書卵懸在黃暗了的絲綫上，好像這位三百年來的通人達士也遭了不幸一樣。</p>
<p>沒法子，把床舖抬出去，到外面九十度的陽光下去消毒。朱竹垞有曝書亭，錢儀吉也寫了曝書雜記，我這只好算個曝書榻吧。雖然簡陋，藉此把書攤開，猶如久別的老友重逢，每一本每一種都含有一篇曲　複雜的故事，倒也可以作為「消夏淸課」之一。</p>
<p>我是一個不能專門的人，讀書病雜而不精，—也許這就是一切無所成的根本原因罷？—眼前曬着的就包着若干矛盾，不只是「漢學詩承記」對照着「漢學商兌」那種短兵相接，譬如說從極右派的「我的奮鬥　到極左的「馬克斯傳」都不妨研究研究，而中國本草式的植物目錄和極新式編目的植物圖鑑，我也都喜歡買，為的是多少可以比較出一點進步的痕迹來。也許我在雜學之中，仍然免不了有歷史的偏嗜，我只恨中國沒有像Fraser爵士那樣精深博大的人物，把風俗習尙寫成一部偉大而細緻的通史，像Golden　Bough似的。就是吃了敗仗的日本人，作學間也很肯下死工夫，無怪乎皇皇數十册的朝鮮古蹟圖譜和支那史蹟圖譜等書要論金條計值，在中國可曾有人作過這種不惜工本的工作嗎？斯坦因爵士的「千佛」ThousandBuddah以及Ancient　Khotan等書，對於我，竟似隨園的詩句一樣，只有在夢中一覘其輝煌的面貌了。</p>
<p>整個地球都正在沉淪中，也許正因為此，才感到舊日史蹟之可愛可寳。可憐我們自己，現今固然談不到什麼像樣的出版，即在天下太平之時，也不曾有過驚人的成績。今年總算中央研究院印了一本「小屯」（即殷虛文字甲編）給我們掙掙而子，可是也恐怕難乎為繼。在街頭報攤上看那薄得像肺病三期的瘦子那樣的刋物，使人懷疑莫非中國的文化只剩了這些如柴的骨頭了？不用講別的，只要你看看「星期六晚郵報」「展望　類的美國刋物，就會感到自己是行將就木了，即使那是充滿了廣吿與色情，不是也得有那份多餘的精力嗎？</p>

<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>近在本欄讀糞雲先生的一篇「也記吳淸源」，記民十六年吳淸源與日人在靑雲閣奕棋事，極有趣味。當年余適在北平，雖未參與靑雲閣之盛會，然據余所聞，與吳淸源奕者，旣非曹汝霖自日偕來之六段名手，亦非禹壽君所記之七段　越應作，實乃日本五段井上孝平也。井上五段與淸源在靑雲閣之會，乃北平圍棋同志聯合主催，靑雲閣主人韓愼先（夏山樓主）亦好此道者，願以樓上一部份作為會所。在此會之前一年，有日本棋院岩本六段，小杉四段，訪問北平，在東城八寳胡同萬歲屋主催歡迎棋會，到者有劉棣懷，顧水如，吳淸源（十三歲）諸人，岩本與劉棣懷對奕，讓二子，結局劉勝，又與顧水如對奕，讓二子，顧負，最後岩本六段與淸源奕，讓三子，結局淸源勝。故淸源之棋名，在十三歲時，日人已知之，靑雲閣之會，中國方面推淸源與非上五段奕，乃偶然之事，並非劉棣懷諸人畏井上而不敢與之一角勝負也。</p>
<p>當時井上與吳淸源共下三盤，第一盤在靑雲閣，時為民十六年十一月，淸源十四歲，執黑子先，以打掛（日本棋語即未終局之謂）結束。越兩日，兩人再奕於李律閣宅，淸源中押勝，（亦日本棋語名詞）再越兩日，兩人又於張伯駒宅，井上孝平中押勝。當時北平有日本商人山崎有民者，亦好棋，以此三局之棋譜，寄回國內七段瀨憲作，　越見之，大驚異，以為吳淸源年僅十四歲，而有此棋力，極有其國棋聖秀策少年時代之作風，遂興邀淸源游日之意。其後淸源東渡，入日本棋院，實基於與井上五段所奕之三局也。</p>
<p>越旣有致淸源游日之意，遂於昭和三年，即民國十七年，派其學生橋本宇太郎（四段）到北平見淸源，再測其實力。橋本與淸源奕二局，歸國向其師報吿，極贊淸源之枇藝　於是中國天才棋童吳淸源之名，喧傳於日本全國，　越邀淸源游日之意愈決。適犬　木堂，牧野伸顯，大倉喜七郎，望月圭介四氏，亦同有此心，東京·北平間書翰往復多次，俱由山崎有民轉洽，至芳澤謙吉（犬養木堂之壻）任中國公使，而淸源游日之舉，乃急轉直下，大體決定，至大倉喜七郎允任淸源留日之全部生活費用，淸源遂與其母，其兄吳浣，在天津乘長安丸啟行矣。在途中，東京讀賣新聞·時事新報各大報，競以「麒麟兒吳淸源來」，「稀代之大天才吳淸源」等等大字標題，報吿其行踪。火車到東京驛時，名人本因坊秀哉，　越憲作門下一行，日本棋院幹事八幡恭助，及日本棋界名士多人，皆在驛站歡迎，盛况空前。</p>

<p>— 樸</p>
<p>「輕羅小扇撲流螢」的韻事，在兒童時代誰都曾經歷過的吧。</p>
<p>在淸凉的夏夜，一點一點的螢光倒處飄流着，像天女脥着俊眼一般，一閃一閃地放出淡綠色的光彩，那麼溫柔，那麼幽靜，構成了夏夜之美麗。</p>
<p>螢，它從不飛到廳堂上，房間中，以及其他一切有燈光的地方來，如果它會飛入廳堂和臥室，那也是當你的燈光熄滅了以後。只有在昏晴的庭院中，才可以發現流螢，而螢光最多的地方是在荒山上，曠野中，墟墓邊，亂草問，業林裏，這些地方往往是亂螢如雨，因為這些地方是整夜被一片黑暗籠覃着，從不會有一點光明照到這處所來。螢的光是要為黑暗而照耀的，它不肯飛在已經有了光亮的地方做它多餘而浪費的工作，它做的是雪裏送炭，而不是錦上添花，雖然它只有那麼一星星的光源。</p>
<p>不知你有機會看見在牆脚的土縫裏剛僵化過去的螢嗎？眞稀奇啊，這時那一小顆螢光仍在那裏照耀着，不過是穆然地凝結地不閃不動，十分鐘後，這光才逐漸滅了。螢生命雖已斷絕，但它生命中剩餘下的一點點光亮還要繼續發揮凈盡才罷休，它到死還在惦記着人問的黑暗。</p>

<p>一九一四，德軍破比利時以攻法，憑四十二生的巨砲以尅列日要塞，後於東西兩面狼奔豕突，胥惟克羅伯廠出品是賴。其時飛機分類未精，量亦不多，僅供偵察及偶然襲擊之用，輙被擊落，至戰爭之後期，始分別偵察機，驅逐機，戰　機，而製作未甚健全，大戰遽吿終結。然二次大戰空軍為主之局，己決定於此時。德於兩大戰之中息期間，專力潛修，羽毛豐滿，故二次戰爭開始，鐵烏縱橫，摧廓波比　荷而入巴黎，席捲全歐。轟炸之外，滑翔機之空運，尤顯奇蹟。惟物質猷乏，油類更苦不繼，至美國參戰，以產量雄富，製作新颕，敏捷又超德國，乃以其人之道，還制其人之身，所謂三軸心德·義·日者，皆以空中勢力减退而屈服。此五年大戰，勝負自以空軍質量之優劣為決定之因棄。</p>
<p>乃於大戰將次完結之際，忽復「曲終奏雅」，一九四五之八月，有兩枚小物，翩然光顧日本之廣島·長崎，使此兩大繁都，頃刻灰燼，比之一九四零八月間之英倫慘景，重大十倍，而時間之經濟，則與暴德之炸英成反比例。於是三次大戰之要素（原子武器），又預洩春光，如首次戰爭末期之飛機小試，透露二次戰爭大轟炸之消息。</p>
<p>邱吉爾於二次戰端甫啟，即想象英倫廢墟之凄凉影片於腦海而無限低徊，則原子戰爭之光紮又將如何？廣島長畸已實際導演兩次，小試已如此，况大規模乎？又據西訊，原子武器，三年以來所成功者，視廣長兩彈已不足道。科學之權威，與地球之末日大有「喜相逢」之勢。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Proceeds from the Sale of American Aid Materials to be Entirely Centralized at the Central Bank; Government Aims to Freeze Most Funds to Contract Currency <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The American Aid Utilization Committee held its second committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th at the No. 1 Official Residence of the Executive Yuan. Those in attendance included Committee members Wang Shijie, Wang Yunwu, Yu Dawei, Yan Jiagan, as well as Deputy Secretary-General Wu Xuelan and others from the American Aid Utilization Committee. Li Gan, a member of the technical delegation who recently returned from the United States, also attended. The meeting was personally presided over by Weng Wenhao, who also serves as Chairman. The discussions lasted four hours, during which concrete decisions were made regarding the implementation of American aid and the establishment of a special account at the Central Bank. The discussion on whether to completely deposit the legal tender obtained from the sale of materials into the Central Bank was particularly detailed. The issue of whether to allow the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Municipal Bank to handle the transfer of American aid proceeds was also carefully considered. Ultimately, it was decided that all legal tender obtained from the sale of materials should be centralized at the Central Bank, which will handle the deposit business. If the Central Bank's institutions are insufficient, it may entrust other national banks to handle the transactions on its behalf, but the funds received must be immediately transferred to the Central Bank. If other national banks incur additional expenses as a result of handling these receipts, the Central Bank may provide subsidies. The technical aspects of implementation will be discussed and decided by the Central Bank and other national banks (please refer to another article and the Central Daily News editorial on the 9th). Regarding the establishment of a special account at the Central Bank as stipulated in Article 5 of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement, it was decided to establish two accounts. One is a special account, where the value of American aid materials plus freight, multiplied by the current exchange rate, will be calculated at the US dollar value and converted into the equivalent amount of Chinese currency to be deposited. This account will be used to offset future sales of American aid materials. The second is a sales revenue deposit account, where the funds obtained from the sale of American aid materials will be deposited. The use of these deposits will be determined by China and the United States in accordance with the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement. The Chinese side hopes to freeze most of the funds to contract currency, minimizing the amount of funds used. The amount to be frozen will be discussed by both China and the United States. Currently, both parties are studying this matter, and it will be presented for discussion and decision at the joint meeting on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Central Daily News editorial on the 9th criticized certain two national banks and one local bank for attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to undermine American aid, and was titled "They Are About to Defeat American Aid." The article pointed out that these banks were showing clear intentions regarding American aid proceeds, treating them as ordinary funds to be fought over. It also stated, "They are preventing the legal tender obtained from the sale of American aid materials from being returned, and immediately using it in the market, ultimately leading to the path of hoarding materials. If they are allowed to do this, they will have eight trillion legal tender circulating in their hands, then there will be eight trillion in floating capital haunting the market every day." The article concluded by proposing three principles that it hoped the Executive Yuan would adopt: (1) American aid proceeds must be directly deposited into the Central Bank; (2) National banks must not hoard American aid materials; (3) Institutions or individuals purchasing American aid materials must not obtain low-interest loans from national banks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Since the Central Daily News editorial was published on the 9th, it has attracted widespread attention. According to sources related to American aid: The two national banks and one local bank referred to in the Central Daily News editorial are the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Municipal Bank. When the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Committee distributed food, the proceeds from the sales were handled by the above banks on behalf of the Central Bank. Three days later, the funds collected were transferred to the Central Bank. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Committee is distributing American aid food, and these three banks are still requesting to handle the transactions on behalf of the Central Bank according to past practice, and are requesting to remit the funds to the Central Bank after three days. However, the American Aid Committee decided on the 9th that if the Central Bank entrusts other national banks to handle the transactions on its behalf, the proceeds from the sales must be immediately transferred to the Central Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yan Jiagan Reports on the Allocation and Quantities Arrived of American Aid Rice, Flour, and Cotton at the Utilization Committee Meeting <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] At the American Aid Utilization Committee meeting on the 9th, in addition to Li Gan reporting on the negotiation process of this American aid loan, Yan Jiagan provided a detailed report on the allocation of American aid materials and the quantities that have arrived in China. According to the report: As of August 5th, taking rice, flour, and cotton as examples, the detailed statistics are as follows: (1) Rice: The first batch ordered totaled 66,829 long tons, the second batch ordered totaled 21,692 long tons, for a total of 88,521 long tons, valued at $16,176,408. 53,629 long tons have arrived, 3,928 long tons are en route, 41,528 long tons have been allocated, and 12,107 long tons remain in storage. (2) Flour: The first batch ordered totaled 8,929 tons, the second batch ordered totaled 8,929 tons, for a total of 17,858 tons, valued at $2,679,920. 8,939 long tons have arrived, and 2,482 long tons are en route, but the flour has not yet been distributed. (3) Cotton: 70,378 bales have been ordered, valued at $12,959,369, and all have arrived. The total value of the ordered rice, flour, and cotton is $31,815,697. In addition to this, there are other orders that have not been included because the payment procedures have not been completed. Fertilizer and oil have been ordered, but have not been included due to unpaid payments. Regarding the use of rice, flour, and cotton, the rice has been included in the rationing program. In addition to the first batch of cotton that has been ordered and arrived, the second batch of $3,370 (thousands) approved by the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration is equivalent to 191,126 bales. Some have arrived, and some are en route. The plan is to exchange cotton for yarn, with one bale of cotton exchanging for 453 pounds of yarn, and then processing the yarn. The calculation method is being studied by the Cotton Subcommittee. Part of the exchanged cotton yarn will be exported to obtain foreign exchange to purchase more cotton, and part will be sold domestically to meet domestic needs. Of the allocated rice, the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Committee received the most, at 39,645 tons, followed by Guangzhou, at 1,883 tons, of which 700 tons were transferred from Guangzhou to Shantou. The rationing price is as close to the market price as possible, at 32 million legal tender per shi, but some impoverished people receive it at 20 million legal tender per shi. This American aid grain is only sufficient for a portion of the rationing needs, and China must raise its own grain sources. The Ministry of Food has recently established an Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee in Shanghai, headed by Yang Chuoan.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Lapham Declares to Reporters That American Aid Has No Regional Bias; Situation in Northeast and North China Not as Serious as Rumored; Desires China to Implement Reform Plans <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[News from this Paper] After a ten-day extensive and on-the-spot investigation in various parts of North and Northeast China, Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, answered reporters' questions at a press conference yesterday with a firm tone: "At this stage, the situation in the Northeast and North China is not as serious as rumored. The situation in the Northeast is even more advanced than it was before June. Generals Wei Lihuang and Fu Zuoyi and others are extremely dutiful, and the spirit of the general public to resist and defend the region is particularly high. This spirit is actually more important than weapons."</p>
<p>It is said that this trip left a particularly deep impression on the industrial opportunities for the future of the Northeast. North China is an important territory of China and also a central industrial area. From the observations made, the general public’s idea that the government will abandon the Northeast and North China after the situation becomes serious is incorrect. Generals Fu and Wei expressed their hope to increase military assistance during the talks, but this point has gone beyond the scope of the personal work I am responsible for. However, I firmly believe that the United States will make an extremely democratic decision on the distribution of military aid to China.</p>
<p>Mr. Lapham reiterated yesterday that the $400 million in American aid was all donated by American taxpayers. China does need American aid at present, but the United States needs to understand whether the aid has been properly used, and whether the planned projects can be gradually realized. I personally believe that China still needs to reform in many areas, such as the tax system. Therefore, I hope that by the coming winter, although we may not be able to see a comprehensive reform completed, there will at least be signs that reform has begun, so that Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman can list facts when reporting to Congress to illustrate how the Chinese government is using the aid to protect China’s independence and sovereignty. The General Administration has no obligation to spend all of the $275 million of aid to China. The nature of the funds is a loan rather than a gift. Therefore, unless the funds are used properly, the General Administration will suspend the use of the funds at any time. The legal tender obtained from the sale of American aid materials must also be used effectively after obtaining the consent of the General Administration. The method of using the funds is being researched.</p>
<p>Mr. Lapham stated that he does not intend to criticize the Chinese government, and this is not his responsibility. However, the Chinese government does not oppose various reforms, but various reform plans are currently stalled. Therefore, I hope to see some action. Although I do not wish to discuss Stillman’s report regarding the $275 million of American aid, I discussed the $60 million of dedicated construction funds and the $10 million of funding for supplementary equipment and parts with President Weng of the Executive Yuan two weeks ago. I believe that it can be increased by $10 million to allow factories in various places to supplement or repair their equipment. In short, American aid to assist China's industrial recovery is not limited to South China and Central China, but will extend to the entire country.</p>
<h3 id="e4">President Truman Approves Arms Supply to Our Country; Bridges Accuses of Prolonged Delay <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, August 8] Senator Bridges announced on the 8th that President Truman has approved the transfer of arms to China under the $125 million military aid plan by the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters. In his letter to Mr. Du, he made it clear that this assistance does not mean that the United States is responsible for China's policies.</p>
<p>Bridges accused Truman of adopting a "deliberate" and "unforgivable" "stagnation and delay" policy, allowing the Soviet Union to extend its power in the Far East. Mr. Jie Bai is a Republican and the current chairman of the Appropriations Committee and a strong advocate of aiding President Chiang Kai-shek of China.</p>
<p>He claimed that, to date, only 9 million yuan—or one-fourteenth of the total—of the 125 million yuan in aid to China has been allocated.</p>
<p>In a letter from Truman to Bridges, he said, "I have ordered the Secretary of Defense to assist the Chinese government in obtaining the supply of these military supplies." He also said, "The outline of the aid to China plan submitted by General Yall of the Chief of the Army and General De Mai, Chief of the War Planning Department, will be given 'due consideration.'" Their opinions have been submitted to the Appropriations Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. "Assistance under this plan cannot be interpreted as the United States being responsible for the policies, actions, or any circumstances that may occur at any time of the Chinese government."</p>
<p>Bridges pointed out that if China cannot obtain materials and military supplies from the U.S. Army, Navy, or other government agencies, it will be "very costly and inefficient" because China must send personnel to U.S. factories to obtain them.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources believe that Bridges' views foreshadow that the Republican Party will expand its aid to China plan if it wins the general election in November.</p>
<p>Bridges particularly accused Truman of "delaying the first delivery for four months after Congress passed the aid to China plan." He also said: Truman's measures are clearly in conflict with Congress, and his policy "cannot be described as a bipartisan policy in any language." Bridges concluded: "I hope that a new policy has begun in China, and I hope that the government's past policy of procrastination towards China will be declared terminated."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, August 8] Hoffman announced that the Agency has approved the purchase of $37 million worth of cotton to supply China.</p>

If Changchun is lost, Panjin will be equally endangered in three months, and North China will share the same fate as the Northeast. 360,000 people in Changchun are on the brink of death.

Seeing the President and his wife arrive in the sedan chair, they clapped and welcomed him. The President and his wife smiled and waved their hats in response. The President wore a white summer cloth short shirt, and added a black bathrobe after climbing the mountain due to the cool weather. He wore a gray cork hat, and his wife wore a floral cheongsam. Since it was late in the evening, they all stayed in the sedan chairs. Yu Jishi and others also took sedan chairs and followed the President up the mountain. When all the staff arrived, the sky was dotted with stars. According to people around the President, the President had been working hard for the past four seasons and came here to take a short rest before returning to Beijing.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Inflation and Currency Shortage <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Over the past week, the four major banks and two bureaus have been issuing currency in large quantities, totaling over 17 trillion. This has led to an easing of credit and a drop in shadow interest rates. However, the market still feels a shortage of cash. When banks and financial institutions try to withdraw cash, anything over 300 million requires the acceptance of promissory notes, with the discount rising to about 10%. In Hankou, the currency shortage is even more severe. The Hubei Provincial Bank in Wuchang was unable to pay out cash, leading to two instances of destruction by depositors. Similar situations are occurring in other cities, which cannot be ignored as a paradoxical phenomenon in the current economic situation.</p>
<p>Since currency is inflating and credit is very loose, why is there a currency shortage? This may seem strange at first glance, but the reason is very simple. Because currency inflation has raised the general price level, it has also increased the need for currency. According to official sources, the rate of price increases far exceeds the multiple of currency issuance. Therefore, the more currency inflates, the less cash there is. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>The scope of currency is not limited to cash alone. Various types of negotiable instruments are substitutes for cash. In normal times, the acceptance and transfer of these substitutes reduces the use and pressure on cash and increases convenience and portability for the public. However, because currency is now inflating excessively, the authorities, to mitigate this inflation, deliberately reduce the use of these instruments, such as prohibiting same-day redemption and cracking down on the issuance of promissory notes. As the scope of substitutes shrinks, the amount of cash needed in the market inevitably increases. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>The circulation of funds between different financial centers originally relied solely on remittances. However, due to currency inflation and capital flight, more restrictions have been imposed to prevent this. As a result, many internal remittances have had to be replaced by transporting cash, further strengthening the need for cash. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Because internal remittances cannot be naturally adjusted, a high exchange rate differential has arisen between the two regions. For example, remitting 10 million from Shanghai to Guangzhou only yields 5.5 million in Guangzhou. As a result, those with the means are finding ways to transport cash to Guangdong, and then remit from Guangdong to Shanghai, seeking to profit nearly 100% in a single transaction. Consequently, the cash in the local area is emptied by these transporters. This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>Currency inflation has raised prices. To control prices, it is necessary to tighten currency and contract credit. The recent extreme shortage of cash and the rising discount rates may involve artificial manipulation to leave room for the issuance of larger denomination banknotes. This is the fifth reason.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of currency issuance. Whether printed abroad or domestically, all banknotes must be issued from the Central Bank here. Logically, Shanghai should not experience a currency shortage. However, due to the above-mentioned factors, this phenomenon has gradually spread from the inland to Shanghai. In addition to the alarming discounts, long lines for cash withdrawals, and unjustified discounts in payments are causing deep pain to the financial and industrial sectors. In particular, the general wage earners mostly receive promissory notes and checks as part of their salary, causing many inconveniences in their daily lives. These phenomena are too deeply related to the people's livelihood and have too great an impact on the entire market, and the authorities should not overlook them!</p>
<p>The authorities' plan to issue large denomination banknotes has been formally announced and partially implemented. Given the severity of the current currency shortage, the time for their introduction should be ripe. If new banknotes of 1 million and 5 million are introduced and circulate smoothly in the market, it is believed that the above-mentioned difficulties can be gradually resolved. Our concern is that the more currency in circulation, the higher the base price will inevitably be, and the more currency will be needed. If this process continues without fundamental change, the currency will become scarce again after a considerable period, and even larger denomination banknotes will become necessary. This vicious cycle will continue indefinitely. When will the currency shortage truly disappear? And how large will the final denomination banknote be?</p>
<p>In conclusion, if the government does not make a strong determination to balance revenue and expenditure quickly, and abandons the idea of ​​making up for deficits by issuing more currency, and if it does not find a way to make the Central Bank's issuing power subject to social supervision and declare it independent of the Ministry of Finance, then this vicious cycle will become increasingly intense and unstoppable.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Assisting Our Reconstruction Efforts: Utilizing Japanese Industry, ECA Sends Personnel to Japan for Investigation <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, United Press] A senior official of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) stated that the $275 million in economic aid to China can be used not only directly by China but also indirectly to restore Japanese trade. They absolutely deny any intention to suggest that Japan restore its pre-war industrial power status, but emphasize that China would benefit greatly if it could utilize Japanese industry in its reconstruction efforts. Apart from cotton, the industrial goods China needs can be sourced from the Far East and other places outside the United States. The ECA has quietly dispatched two people from its China mission to Japan for a preliminary investigation. It is reported that Japan will import coal (mostly Kailuan coal) and iron sand from China, and supply China with parts for industrial facilities built during the occupation, as well as parts and equipment for the Yuehan Railway. In the future, Japan will supply goods to China. It will be more economical to obtain goods from Japan than from the United States. The extent to which Japanese industry will assist China's construction depends on the Chinese projects selected by the members of the ECA's China Construction Survey Team. Informed sources say that the ECA is seriously considering supplying coal to Japan. Most of the iron supplied to Japan will be taken from the iron left by Japan near the Yangtze River. ECA officials said that this policy is the same as the work taken in Europe to promote East-West trade, and the policy will also be coordinated with the Allied plan to enable Japan to obtain US dollars to purchase US cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Zhou Yide Told Reporters That China and Japan Should Assist Each Other <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Another dispatch] Republican Congressman Zhou Yide said when interviewed by reporters, "Once China gets rid of its fears of communism and aggression, it will be willing to restore trade relations with Japan." Zhou's remarks were made after the ECA announced its hope to include part of the promotion of Japanese industry in China's reconstruction plan. He said, "The Chinese are very uneasy about the amount of American aid to their old enemy, Japan. They feel that we give more preferential treatment to the aggressors than to the allies, which is not without reason. However, the pre-war trade pattern is considered absolutely necessary for the prosperity of the entire East." He explained, "Japan cannot get rid of its relationship with China if it wants to maintain the livelihood of its people. At the same time, China needs a large number of cheap goods produced by Japan before the war. If we can help China defeat the communist army, end the civil war that is destroying its economy, and help it get rid of the fear of aggression, then China will definitely be able to restore its trade relations with Japan and other Far Eastern countries. Therefore, all efforts are not too late." He also said, "The success or failure of Japan's future depends on China's development. If China falls into the hands of the communists, it will be impossible for us to ask Japan not to empty the American treasury again." Zhou said: He believes that the level of Japanese industry should be slightly higher than before the war. Because the Japanese have increased and must engage in huge reconstruction work, the previously stipulated level of Japanese industry can only enable the Japanese people to maintain their survival. As for Japan's war potential, it is far easier to control than Germany's war potential. Because Japan lacks raw materials and is easily isolated, Zhou advocated strict control over the iron sand and steel put into Japan, so as to effectively control Japan's war potential. He also believes that the United States should stabilize the value of the yen itself without waiting for the consent of other countries. Zhou also said: It is not the right time to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. There are too many things we need to deal with now. He believes that other countries have no desire to complete the peace treaty with Japan until the Berlin situation is resolved. Zhou Yide also said: China and Japan may face fierce wars in many industrial products in the future. However, in the process of China's industrialization, the two countries will assist each other and not really compete. Zhou also hopes that China will become strong, abandon its current fears and rejection, and then this situation can be realized.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] Fifteen students from Changbai Normal College in Beiping, including Fu Wenzhong, were previously arrested after being reported by students of the college as being communist agents disguised as students. The Beiping Garrison Headquarters investigated and found that Guan Zhongru's crime was minor and was released on bail by Changbai Normal College. The remaining seven people, including Wang Yu, confessed to their reactionary behavior. The Garrison Headquarters transferred them to the Beiping Special Criminal Court on the afternoon of the 9th along with the evidence.

<p>Dispersed successively after persuasion</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] More than 100 students from the private Zhongyuan Institute of Technology in Henan went to the Ministry of Education to petition on the 9th. It is reported that the college has not been established for a long time, and the school's board of directors has not been registered. The Ministry of Education has no case to check, and the students have no student status. However, when the college was trapped by the communists, the students fled to Nanjing for refuge. The Ministry of Education went to Nanjing to provide shelter and relief. Later, the Guidance Association sent them to Zhenjiang as a permanent residence, and provided daily relief funds so that the students could study and participate in the university transfer examination. The students suddenly came to Nanjing collectively from Zhenjiang, requesting the Ministry of Education to exempt them from the examination and assign them to ten universities. The Ministry of Education believed that the students' request violated the regulations, and the method of recommendation had long been abolished. Tang Peijing, the Director of the Ministry, and Tian Peilin, the Deputy Minister, received and guided them successively. After two rounds of persuasion by Guo Zhonggui, the vice chairman of the school's board of directors, they dispersed successively in the evening.</p>

<p>Japanese People Regard Themselves as Anti-Communist Base</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Huang Wanju, a leader of overseas Chinese in Japan, returned to China from Japan and arrived in Shanghai. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing to meet the President and pay his respects, and report on the situation of overseas Chinese. Huang told reporters yesterday: There are currently 30,000 overseas Chinese in Japan. Their current situation is very different from that at the time of victory. At that time, the professions run by overseas Chinese sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, and they were all thriving. But so far, due to the discrimination and stricter control of the Japanese, people cannot help but feel that things have changed. He said: The progress of Japan's industrial recovery is very rapid, especially the textile and chemical industries. Japan's democratic reforms after the war have indeed made progress, but at present, the Japanese people regard themselves as an anti-communist base, and they are all eager to try and look forward to the outbreak of a world war as soon as possible. I am sincerely afraid that the development of this concept will make the democratic reforms completely abandoned and pose a threat to our country.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Talks About the Undetermined Border between China and Myanmar Should be Handled Appropriately, We Have Absolutely No Extra Land Claims <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on the 9th: Since the Ministry of Interior's border survey team returned to Beijing, there has been much speculation about the undetermined border between China and Myanmar. The Associated Press's Nanjing dispatch on the 8th stated that China will make a land claim to Myanmar with an area of ​​more than 100,000 square kilometers, such as the size of Zhejiang, based on the results of the border demarcation study. This is especially absurd. China and Myanmar should have appropriate and reasonable handling of the undetermined border in order to maintain their common interests. However, China has absolutely no claim for any additional land. Our government has repeatedly expressed this attitude clearly, and it is well known to our neighbor, Myanmar. Therefore, there is no need to refute any rumors. However, he pointed out that the Associated Press's report has damaged the traditional friendship between China and Myanmar, and therefore made the above explanation.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Complex Issue of Circulating Vouchers: Wei Lihuang Cables Beiping Requesting Opening of Exchange Remittance Queue Number Restrictions; It is Reported That Zuo Yifu Replied by Cable Proposing Solutions <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The issue of circulating vouchers has developed into an economic deadlock between North China and Northeast China. The Northeast Suppression Headquarters cabled Beiping, requesting the North China Suppression Headquarters to open the queue number restrictions to ease the intense emotions of the people in Northeast China before "August 19th". It is reported that Zuo Yifu replied to Wei Lihuang by cable last night, proposing solutions. The details are unknown. According to senior officials familiar with this issue, the method of restricting queue numbers for remittances between 200 million and 23 million has had little effect, because most of the remitters have broken up large amounts into smaller amounts, or consolidated smaller amounts into larger amounts for remittance. Large amounts can be approved through various methods.</p>
<p>Another important deadlock is that too many idle employees of the central government in various institutions in the Northeast are staying in Beiping and Tianjin, which has changed the nature of the so-called resettlement fee. These "suspended-from-duty-but-still-receiving-salary" personnel receive more than 2 billion legal currency per month, based on the fourth-level of entrusted appointments. The resettlement fee remitted to Beiping and Tianjin by the Northeast Transportation Agency in June alone reached more than half of its total personnel expenses of over 400 billion circulating vouchers. Currently, various parties are studying how to rationalize the treatment of those who are idle in Beiping and Tianjin, and pay them according to the Beiping and Tianjin civil servant standards, directly issuing legal currency in Beiping and Tianjin.</p>

<h3 id="e49">American, British, and French Envoys Receive New Instructions - Visit Molotov for the Third Time - Discuss the Overall Situation in Germany to Prevent the Deterioration of the Situation <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London Radio Broadcast, Moscow, 9th - The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov again at 5 p.m. this afternoon (2 p.m. standard time) to discuss the overall situation in Germany. This is the third meeting between the American, British, and French diplomats and Molotov. The details of the meeting remain strictly confidential.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London Radio Broadcast, 9th - Although a glimmer of hope has appeared for the reconvening of the four-power conference, some influential figures in the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are pessimistic that the East and West will ultimately fail to reach an agreement on the German question. At most, they hope for a buffer plan that can prevent the overall situation from deteriorating to the point of causing a world war. This pessimism is based on the following facts: (1) The Western powers will never voluntarily abandon Germany and allow it to become another satellite state of the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union, fearing that a unified Germany may join the West against the East, is also unwilling to abandon eastern Germany. (3) Germany, caught between the struggle between the two great powers of East and West, has no third way out except to continue to remain divided. In fact, what the East and West are arguing about is nothing more than controlling the whole of Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 8th] Diplomatic circles stated on the 8th that the Soviet Union fears that the four-power foreign ministers' conference may reveal obvious cracks behind the scenes, and this concern may be the reason for the current slow pace of East-West negotiations in Moscow. It is reported that US Ambassador Smith, French Ambassador Chataigneau, and British Special Envoy Roberts have received new instructions from their respective governments. Everything about the Moscow negotiations is of a speculative nature, but it is generally believed that the Soviet Union may intend to relax the agenda of the foreign ministers' conference to discuss issues that the Soviet Union is willing to discuss, while also excluding any issues that may make the Soviet Union embarrassed and uneasy. The so-called embarrassing and uneasy issues include the treaty to restore Austria's independence, the issue of Trieste's return to Italy, and the future territorial issues of Germany and Poland. It is said that if the future issue of Trieste and the issue of restoring Austria's independence are discussed, the increasingly serious split between the Communist Information Bureau and Yugoslav Marshal Tito will clearly become a factor. At the same time, in any decision on the broader German question, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, has a desire to win Germany's friendship, and on the other hand, needs to allow Poland's demand to make the current temporary border between Germany and Poland a permanent border. The Western allies have suggested that Trieste be returned to Italy, but Tito opposes this move. If the Soviet Union agrees to this, the Italian Communist bloc will be greatly strengthened. As for the Austrian question, Tito has demanded compensation from Austria. The Soviet Union may believe that supporting Austria is beneficial to it, but doing so would further exacerbate the conflict between Tito and the Communist Information Bureau.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 8th] Moscow Radio issued a stern warning today, saying that aircraft are constantly violating the Soviet airspace over Berlin, and this is a rude provocation that may cause serious consequences.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 8th] The Soviet Union has begun a new step in the Cold War in Berlin. Police controlled by the Soviet Union searched the residences of police officers in the Western District living in the Soviet District on the evening of the 7th. When some people were arrested, they did not even have time to wear their clothes. The Soviet action occurred after the split of the Berlin Police Department. Berlin Police Chief Markgraf, a pro-Communist, was removed from office by the city government and Deputy Chief Sturm was elected to succeed him. The Soviet side does not recognize Markgraf's dismissal, and Markgraf is now the police chief of the Soviet District. The arrested police officers are members of Sturm's staff because they still live in the Soviet District due to the housing shortage.</p>

<p>American Newspapers' Views on the Situation in South Korea</p>
<p>[United States Information Service New York, 8th] When American newspapers published the news that Korean President Syngman Rhee planned to establish a US-Korea Joint Committee to arrange for the withdrawal of troops, they stated that the American military occupation of South Korea would continue indefinitely. The New York Times pointed out that the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean question stipulates that within 30 days after the establishment of the Korean National Government, the US and Soviet armies must simultaneously withdraw from their respective occupied areas. Rhee's government, the result of the election held in South Korea on May 10 under the supervision of UN observers, will formally assume sovereignty over Korea on August 15 (the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese rule). However, the Soviet military occupation authorities in North Korea have refused to recognize the regime led by Syngman Rhee. When proposing the establishment of the US-Korea Joint Committee, Rhee told the Korean National Assembly: "We feel that the liberation of Korea has not yet been completed, and therefore, we are willing for the American army to remain here as liberation forces." Rhee said that his government will treat the North Korean Communist election as "rebellious activities and will be punished." He said he would request the American army to remain until his government has the ability to defend itself and resist possible attacks from North Korea and South Korean Communists.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 8th] French Finance Minister Reynaud stated in the National Assembly this afternoon that if the parliament refuses to grant him the power to reform the tax code, he intends to resign and will not be thanked. In his speech, Reynaud stressed that economic recovery must be sought now to avoid a dramatic situation when the Marshall Aid Plan ends in 1952.</p>
<p>He said that even with American aid, it can only meet two-thirds of the country's needs. In 1949, the government will still need to find another 500 billion francs to compensate for the losses of the war and 600 billion francs to make up for the lack of a budget. If we do not act quickly, production will inevitably collapse when American aid ends. Reynaud then denied any intention to implement the ukase system, saying that a violent coup is easy to implement for economic recovery. Reynaud then briefly outlined his plan, which will (1) focus on increasing exports to the US dollar gold zone; (2) increase production; (3) reduce national expenses; (4) seek to make state-owned industries profitable; (5) increase tax revenue by reforming the tax system. Reynaud also announced in vague terms that he would raise new debts, but no firm decision has yet been made on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Behind-the-Scenes Life of Little Stalin (1) <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Translated by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper</p>
<p>(Originally published in the August 17 issue of the American "Observer Magazine")</p>
<p>Stalin's private life is surrounded by an iron curtain. He has three children, two of whom—Yakov and Svetlana—are similarly protected by the dictator and kept secret from the outside world. But his 28-year-old child, Vasily, is fond of showing off, indulging in luxurious living and public scandals, which is the most taboo behavior of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Vasily Stalin is a pampered, arrogant brat. His behavior is not like that of the son of a professional proletarian, but rather like that of a luxurious prince. Soviet newspapers sometimes portray him as a brave and martial air force hero in an attempt to conceal his mischievous behavior. But in the eyes of the friends he betrayed, the women he seduced, and the people he detained during drinking and revelry, he is certainly not a hero.</p>
<p>Wishing Newborns to Dance All Night</p>
<p>Young Vasily Stalin was born in 1920 to his father's second wife—the young and beautiful Aliluyeva. At that time, she had just graduated from college and was 21 years younger than her husband. At the naming ceremony feast, Stalin followed his relatives and friends in drinking and dancing wildly, without showing any signs of fatigue. Later, according to his friend, the journalist Radek, he became so emotional that he drew his pistol and fired it out the window. But time flies, and within a few years, his love for his son gradually cooled. The child disliked books, performed poorly in school, and often played pranks, making his teachers laugh and cry, and unable to do anything about it, because they dared not punish the child of the national hero. Vasily went to school by car every day, sitting behind his desk fidgeting, waiting for the moment when school was over, when he could hide in the car again—his favorite thing.</p>
<p>Stalin originally hoped that his son would be able to inherit his mantle, or at least become a government official. Now, seeing all this, his hopes have been dashed. So when Vasily suddenly became interested in flying, he was overjoyed. After graduating from school in 1939, his father allowed him to embark on the dangerous career of a pilot. Vasily has now grown into a slender, medium-sized young man with thick hair, closely resembling many photos of his father. The nose, low forehead, and thick hair are all like his father. He still ignored theory at aviation school, boldly performing various dangerous aerial maneuvers.</p>
<p>In 1941, he graduated from aviation school, received the rank of air force lieutenant, and was assigned to serve in a fighter unit on the northern front. Now the whole world seemed to be unfolding before him, and he immediately felt the taste of success, career, and power. He saw that his superiors were unwilling to send him to perform combat missions, apparently fearing that he would hurt his father's heart if something happened to him, so he asked to be assigned to the position of commander. He was assigned to lead a squadron of 18 fighter planes (with an expert serving as his assistant). From then on, his position gradually increased.</p>
<p>Showing Off and Abusing Power</p>
<p>At the same time, from that time on, this young commander gradually imitated his father in putting on the airs of a petty dictator. Regardless of the level of their position, he often scolded older air force officers for trivial matters, issued decrees to punish them, arbitrarily arrested people, and shouted loudly, using the intimidating tone used by senior commanders: "Do you want to go to Siberia?" But the actual combat operations were directed by the respectful assistant, who patiently listened to his superior's orders and then took the necessary measures according to his own ideas. But Vasily's superiors, in order to please the great dictator, still promoted and paid the young officer and awarded him various medals.</p>
<p>By 1944, he had already pinned the rank of colonel on his shoulders. Nine months later, Air Force Marshal Novikov submitted an order to Stalin for him to sign, appointing his son as a general. Vasily had not yet turned 24. But his father did not sign the order. He was determined to make his ambitious son abandon evil and return to righteousness, and at the same time teach a lesson to those officers who indulge his son with excessive flattery.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Price Control Plan Not Adopted - Truman to Issue Statement - Remains Silent on Senators' Impeachment Threat <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 8th United Press] The deeply contentious members of the 80th US Congress have returned home. Truman is said to have drafted a statement criticizing their disapproval of his legislative agenda. The 13-day special session of Congress adjourned on the evening of the 7th after passing moderate anti-inflation and housing bills amid the most politically contentious climax in recent years. Demands for wage and price controls and rationing powers were not passed.</p>
<p>Authoritative executive authorities say Truman will reluctantly sign the Republican price and housing bill and will issue a statement early this week attacking the bill as being untimely. It is not yet known whether the President will personally respond to or have other Democrats respond to Senator Ferguson's threat to impeach the President. Speculation is that Truman will remain silent. Ferguson condemned the President in the Senate for refusing to give Congress access to federal civil servant files, placing legislators in an intolerable situation because they will blindly legislate or force Truman to respond to his actions.</p>

<p>[United Press Naples, 9th] Mussolini's son, Romano Mussolini, denied on the 9th Italian newspaper reports that he, his mother Donna Rachele, and his sister Anna Maria will participate in a film produced by an American film company about the life of Mussolini. Rome's pro-Communist Republic Daily said that Donna Rachele had already accepted the invitation to appear in the film. The only member of the Mussolini family who refused the invitation was Mussolini's daughter, Ida, the wife of former Fascist Foreign Minister Ciano. Ciano, the newspaper also said, The role of Mussolini's last mistress, Claretta Petacci, will be played by her sister, who "apparently rushed back from Spain to participate in the performance," because Petacci herself was executed along with Mussolini.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency New York, 9th] One of the three Soviet teachers who suddenly "disappeared" on the eve of their return to the Soviet Union, Sangmarin, has now approached the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this country, requesting protection. Sang, his wife (also a teacher at a Soviet Overseas Children's School), and their three children reportedly disappeared on July 31 as they were preparing to board a ship to return to the Soviet Union. Another theory is that they did not want to be repatriated and were hiding in a White Russian home. Sang's surrender to the Federal Bureau of Investigation coincided with the "rescue" of Sang's colleague, Mrs. Goronkina, 7th, by Soviet consular officials. Mrs. Gao, 52, was supposed to return home on the same ship as Sang. According to the Soviet Consul General, Mrs. Gao was drugged and abducted by a White Russian, and was later rescued from a White Russian farm by him and his assistants. It appears that Soviet citizens and White Russians here have been fighting for some time over the unwillingness of Soviet overseas Chinese to be recalled, and this intense competition has become increasingly important. It is reported that the House Committee to Investigate Actions Against US Interests will request that the State Department decide whether members of the committee may enter the Soviet consulate, question Mrs. Gao, or request that Sang appear before the committee to answer questions about the spy case.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington, 8th] The US Air Force is rapidly expanding its B29 Superfortress reserves to the front line to repel enemy attacks on the United States. Eight heavy bomber squadrons capable of carrying giant bombs have been organized within the United States, with five more overseas, and one in Alaska. Each heavy bomber squadron has 30 aircraft. The bomber squadrons overseas include three stationed in the UK, one in Guam, and one in Germany, but the one in Germany will return home. The United States has a total of 13 heavy bomber squadrons, 390 heavy bombers that can attack any region of the world within hours of notification. The US Air Force plans to expand its medium and heavy bomber squadrons to 21 by July next year. Four to six squadrons will be B29 Superfortresses, and these aircraft are now medium bombers, because the B36 bomber has six engines and a range of 10,000 miles, twice that of the former. Two to four squadrons are composed of B36s and newer B50s. The B50 is an expansion of the B36, with increased range and payload.</p>

<p>The City Council previously resolved in the Sixth General Assembly to send a letter to the City Government requesting that the Central Government re-determine the jurisdictional affiliation of Zhudi and Ban Town, which were mistakenly designated as provincial, and temporarily not transfer the part of the town under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. It is now learned that the City Government recently received a telegraphed reply from the Ministry of the Interior, stating that the new boundary lines of all provinces and cities were submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government for record-keeping. Further changes will increase disputes. Moreover, the division of urban areas should be based on actual needs. In the future, when agriculture, industry, and other sectors in each area have developed to a considerable extent, they can be changed at any time. For now, the original plan should be maintained. After discussion at the municipal meeting, it was decided to follow the original plan decided by the Executive Yuan, and reapply for changes when the city's municipal administration and agriculture and industry need development in the future. According to reports, the new provincial and municipal boundary lines were drafted by the Ministry of the Interior after convening a provincial and municipal boundary demarcation conference last year, using Panlong Port, Xiaolai Port, and Zhu Port as the new provincial and municipal boundary between Shanghai and Zhejiang, forming a natural straight line between the three ports.</p>

<h3 id="e73">New Industrial Utility Prices: Impacting Factory Costs, General Labor Union Appeals to Maintain Original Prices Temporarily, Sends Telegram to Council Requesting Special Meeting <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The municipal General Labor Union believes that the threefold increase in utility prices will stimulate general price increases and directly impact factory costs. Given the current industrial depression and the weak purchasing power of the general public, sales of factory products have already sharply declined. If costs increase further, it will be even more difficult to sustain operations, inevitably leading to factory closures and resulting in a serious unemployment problem. A meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. during the 50th Standing Council meeting of the General Labor Union to discuss countermeasures. It was resolved to petition the municipal government, explaining that the utility price increases are unreasonable, and that adjustments should consider the burden on citizens and factories. A request will be submitted to the central government to restore subsidies. A telegram will also be sent to the council requesting a special meeting to discuss this issue. Prior to the convocation of the special meeting, the original prices should be maintained to alleviate the hardship of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Responsible Parties from Zhabei Electricity and Other Companies Describe the Difficult Situation Faced by Each Company <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the water and electricity price issue for August, reporters visited responsible parties from Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, China Merchants Electrical Company, Pudong Electrical Company, Mainland Water Company, and other companies, summarizing their comments as follows: Public utilities take serving citizens as their premise. Restricted by legal regulations, excessive profits are impossible. Now that the country and society's economy has reached a dead end, each company cannot entertain extravagant hopes. Merely seeking that income is sufficient for reinvestment is already an achievement. However, each time water and electricity prices are adjusted, they are repeatedly reduced by the Public Utilities Bureau, resulting in huge losses and deep debts. The situation has worsened since June. The reasons for each company's difficulties are analyzed as follows: 1. The cost of living has increased dramatically since June. 2. Changes in exchange settlement methods have caused prices to rise linearly. 3. Fuel prices have risen sharply month by month. 4. Water and electricity are paid for after use. The prices announced at the beginning of the month can only be gradually collected around the beginning of the following month. The actual value of the currency is sometimes only 20-30% of the value at the time of the adjustment. Due to the above reasons, each company faces a shortage of funds and cannot make ends meet. In the past, the difference was small, and government loans could be used to supplement it. Recently, the amount of the shortage has become increasingly large, and loans are all over hundreds of billions of yuan, with no continuous supply possible. It is estimated that the shortfall in income and expenditure of each company in July is: Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: 425.6 billion yuan. China Merchants Electrical Company: 124.5 billion yuan. Pudong Electrical Company: 166 billion yuan. Mainland Water Company: 15.04 billion yuan. All dividends, depreciation, etc. have not yet been included, and it is really impossible to maintain reinvestment next month. As for the prices announced for August, they are still insufficient based on the actual situation. For example, Shanghai Electric Power Company, which supplies the largest amount of electricity in the city, is estimated to have a shortfall of more than 2 trillion yuan even if it charges according to the August approved electricity price. The estimated shortfall in income and expenditure of each China Merchants Company is as follows: 1. Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: a shortfall of more than 1 trillion yuan. 2. China Merchants Electrical Company: a shortfall of 203.2 billion yuan. 3. Pudong Electrical Company: a shortfall of 346 billion yuan. 4. Mainland Water Company: a shortfall of 220 billion yuan. Currently, each company is unable to purchase necessary equipment, and reduced efficiency will be unavoidable in the future. If the approved water and electricity prices for August are changed again, the operation will be even more difficult. As a result, the amount of water production and power generation of each company will depend solely on the amount of income. Maintaining the length of the supply may be impossible to continue. The countless consequences are unbearable to imagine.</p>

<p>Mayor Says Shanghai Is Still Cheaper</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday that the municipal government really cannot control the soaring prices of public utilities. The authorities certainly take into account the burden on citizens as a prerequisite, but they also have to consider the cost of public utilities in order to maintain operations. According to Mayor Wu, public utility prices in Nanchang are already five times higher than in Shanghai, but the people do not complain because the public utility company in Nanchang was forced to shut down electricity and water services due to its inability to maintain operations, causing the people unbearable hardship. They were forced to pay high prices to allow it to continue supplying services. In fact, the cost of Shanghai Electric Power Company in this city is indeed the lowest in the country. The reporter told him that some senior employees of the company are paid in US dollars, which has caused much criticism from the citizens. Mayor Wu said: The municipal government has also raised this issue with the company, and the company has agreed to gradually reduce it.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the lightning strike, electrical leakage, and fire tragedy at the Yongbei Underwear Manufacturing Factory on Baoshan Road, another seven people have died from their injuries as of last night, bringing the total number of deaths to 63, including previous fatalities. Factory owner Cai Hongsheng, his wife, and his sister-in-law Ye Dai were all found dead one after another in the early morning of yesterday. After being sent to the morgue for examination, they were sent to the Dazhong Funeral Home for funeral arrangements. Among the workers, four seriously injured workers died yesterday, including Xie Zukang, Wang Baofeng, Gu Fufu, and Xue Fugen. They were also sent to the morgue for examination. Currently, the seriously injured workers receiving treatment in the hospital include Mao Chugan at the Sino-American Hospital, Dai Gengsheng and Ma Gongqing at the Municipal Fifth Hospital, Shen Shengquan and Zhang Fulin at the Fourth Hospital, and Xie Genyao and Hu Hao at the Gongji Hospital.</p>
<p>Fire Insurance Compensation Still Under Study</p>
<p>It is reported that factory owner Cai Hongsheng, from Hangzhou, was 38 years old and had been in the shirt business for more than ten years. He came from a poor background, gradually accumulated capital from apprenticeship, rented a mezzanine for small-scale operations, and expanded year by year due to his good interpersonal relationships, finally achieving today's success. Unexpectedly, a natural disaster struck, causing this catastrophe, and he and his wife and others died together, which made everyone who heard the news sigh! Fortunately, his son, Gengsheng, who is twelve years old, suffered only minor injuries and is not in serious danger. Cai's mother, who is over eighty years old, lives in the old house in Hangzhou, and no one has been notified yet. It is heard that the factory had fire insurance worth 48.3 billion with Anping, Xinhua, and Taihuosheng insurance companies. However, the current value of assets in the factory, including 1,000 bolts of poplin, finished shirts, and various raw materials, is estimated to be worth more than 100 billion. Therefore, how to compensate is still under study.</p>
<p>General Labor Union Expresses Sympathy and Investigates Responsibility</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the Shanghai Shirt Industry Association held an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at the Xinya Restaurant to discuss the tragedy at the factory. It was decided to form an Aftermath Handling Committee for the Yongbei Factory Fire, and five people, including Chuan Liangjun, Chen Bao, Wang , Chen Hanquan, and Zhu Lin, were appointed to be responsible. A funeral arrangement team for the factory owner and workers and a cleanup assistance team were established. All directors and supervisors immediately paid 20 billion yuan in legal tender for funeral and other expenses. In addition, Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the General Labor Union, visited the factory and various hospitals yesterday morning to express condolences to the injured workers and the families of the deceased. Ye Xianggao, executive director of the association, assisted in taking care of clothing, coffins, and funeral arrangements. However, the workers died unnaturally. In addition to expressing deep condolences, the responsibility for the accident will be investigated, and accusations will be filed. According to the Factory Law, the factory's safety equipment was crude. The municipal government is requested to investigate responsibility, and it has been decided that: (1) The General Labor Union will send personnel to participate in the Yongbei Underwear Factory Fire Support Association. (2) Personnel will be sent to express condolences to the injured workers and the families of the deceased. (3) Fundraising will be launched to provide pensions to the families of the deceased.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The prices of rice and public utilities for this month have increased very sharply. It is generally expected that the cost of living index for the first half of the month will also jump to an unprecedented level. The reporter asked Mayor Wu yesterday, and Wu also believed that the increase in the cost of living index was inevitable, especially since the compilation of the workers' index primarily uses rice and public utilities. According to Mayor Wu's estimate, the increase will be very significant.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On November 2 of last year, Chen Yongji, intending to defraud foreign exchange, falsely claimed to be the person in charge of Jinhua Wujiang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and forged and affixed the seal of the Jinhua County Chamber of Commerce, and applied to the Import and Export Control Commission to participate in the quota allocation for the third quarter of last year. The Import and Export Control Commission did not investigate in detail and allocated foreign exchange quota of 29,311 Hong Kong dollars. In addition, Zhang Hongming and Wang Linggui also falsely claimed to be the persons in charge of Jiande County Mingxin Dyeing Factory on October 27 of last year, forged and affixed the seal of the Jiande County Chamber of Commerce, and had the defendant Zhu Haowen sign to certify the application, defrauding the Import and Export Control Commission of 2,495 US dollars in foreign exchange.

<h3 id="e82">Zhao Huijue Issues Statement: No Introductions of Personnel for Concurrent Jobs, Overdue Fees Not Passed on to Users, Street Light Fees Paid in Full Every Month <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>After the new utility prices for this month were announced, there were different views from various parties. Some people questioned the situation, and some involved private individuals. Zhao Huijue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, specially issued a statement yesterday to explain the situation. He stated that: (1) Regarding the statement in "a certain newspaper that important technical personnel of the Public Utilities Bureau are all working concurrently in foreign companies through the director's connections," since I took office, I have never introduced any employee to foreign or Chinese public utility companies, and none of the personnel in this bureau are working concurrently in foreign companies. (2) Regarding the point that "the 'overdue fees' listed in the report of the Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Council have become 'bad debts' and are passed on to the users," the 'overdue fees' listed on the accounts of each company are actually different from 'bad debts'. The company must wait for a considerable period of time for 'overdue fees' to be considered 'bad debts', such as when the defaulting user moves or closes down and cannot be collected, before they are included in 'bad debts' in order to be calculated. This bureau does not include 'overdue fees' when calculating prices. Regarding the "300 million yuan in electricity fees owed by the Public Utilities Bureau to the French Concession Electric Company from March to May" listed in the report, this is the street light electricity fee for the Old French Concession area. According to the regulations, the monthly street light electricity fees to be paid by the municipal government are paid to the company by this bureau after summarizing the information and requesting the municipal government to allocate funds and transfer them to the company. The overdue street light electricity fees mentioned in the report were allocated on May 17 for March, June 8 for April, and July 27 for May. This bureau paid the company immediately after the municipal government allocated the funds and there were no delays.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Silver Coins Reappear: The Old North Gate Flourishes, "Scalpers" Are Most Active in the Morning <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] As a result of malignant inflation, it is well known that gold and US dollars are sought after for possession by the public. Next in line, silver coins, which have been in the cold palace for more than a decade, have also reappeared in the prosperous world.</p>
<p>Although the government has explicitly prohibited silver dollar trading, the existence of the silver dollar market is a well-known fact, just as the black market for gold banknotes can never be eradicated. In Nanjing, it is said that silver dollar trading has become an open activity. Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and the authorities enforce the law more strictly. The silver dollar market appears in a semi-open form, colloquially known as "opening one eye and closing the other," as if it were similar.</p>
<p>The history of the silver coin market in this city is about half a year. According to insiders, the origin is that many transactions in the Hankou area at that time used silver dollars as the unit, and the demand for silver coins was very high. Some independent peddlers came to Shanghai to search for purchases. They contacted the vendors who set up stalls selling silverware in the Old North Gate area, reselling and selling them, and thus a group of "scalpers" in the capacity of merchants emerged. They bought and sold, profiting from the difference. The transactions took place on the road, and slowly everyone near and far knew about it, and it became a market.</p>
<p>Waiting for Customers on the Sidewalk</p>
<p>In addition to Henan Road at the Old North Gate, which is the main base of the silver dollar market, there are sometimes "scalpers" "pioneering" between Henan Road, Tianjin Road, and Ningbo Road, as well as near Xinghualou on Fourth Avenue, but that is only a minority. It is estimated that there are hundreds of "scalpers" engaged in this business. They stand in groups of three or five on the sidewalk waiting for customers from 7:00 in the morning until 7:00 in the evening. They mostly carry only a small amount of silver coins and legal tender with them. The large batch of goods is carefully stored in nearby residences to avoid being confiscated. After agreeing on the quantity and price with the customer, they ask the customer to wait, and then immediately go home to fetch the silver coins or banknotes for exchange. The exchange location is within a few alleys to avoid the eyes and ears of the police.</p>
<p>Scam and Escape from Upstairs in a Brothel</p>
<p>However, there are generally few police patrols before 9:00 a.m. and after 5:00 p.m. At this time, they will trade openly on the road. The busiest time of the day is around 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning. Like the current hot weather, the period from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. is the quietest. If there is a large amount of buying and selling that is inconvenient to exchange on the road or in the alley, the customer can ask them to be sent to a designated location, or follow them to the storage location for transactions. However, in the latter case, customers must be "old hands," otherwise there is a risk of being cheated or robbed. A few days ago, a customer from another location was brought upstairs to a brothel by two "scalpers," who took the legal tender and pretended to go downstairs to pick up the goods, but the two disappeared one after another.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Has People Who Specialize in Collecting Yuan Heads</p>
<p>The silver coins that are bought and sold are divided into "Big Heads," "Small Heads," "Dragon Dollars," and "Eagle Dollars." "Big Head" is also known as "Yuan Head," which is a silver dollar with a portrait of Yuan Shikai. "Small Head" is also known as "Sun Head," which is a silver dollar with a portrait of President Sun. The price of "Big Head" is slightly higher than that of "Small Head." It is said that some people in Hong Kong specialize in collecting silver dollars and specify that they must have Yuan Shikai's head, so the "Yuan Head" is more valuable than the "Sun Head." In addition to these two, there are also "Dragon Dollars" and "Eagle Dollars," but because the number in circulation is very small, they have become unpopular items, and the price is discounted by 20-30% regardless of whether they are sold.</p>
<p>Searching for Hoarded Coins Along Two Routes</p>
<p>Needless to say, the source of silver dollars is the hoarding by the people. Some "scalpers" are specifically responsible for buying them in the cities along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes. Although the profit they get from each silver dollar is only one or two hundred thousand yuan, if they have dozens of transactions on average every day, their income is indeed substantial. Today, in addition to independent peddlers and "scalpers," there are also many ordinary citizens with limited income who have a slight surplus in the silver coin market. In order to preserve the value of their currency, they buy ten or twenty coins at a time and sell them one by one when they need money. Because of their painstaking efforts, the silver dollar market is becoming more and more lively.</p>

Review opinion: Revise the review opinion of the third letter in the sixth document to be a letter requesting the municipal government to actively repair the wharves and warehouses from No. 10 to No. 18 in Nanshi and set a deadline for completion.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Yuan Hanwei (26 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 42, Niuqiao Lane, West Fahua), a worker at Shuncheng Towel Factory on Anyuan Road, resigned last June. The factory paid him a retirement bonus of 500,000 yuan. This July, Yuan, being unemployed, tried unsuccessfully to extort 100 million yuan from the factory. On the 4th of this month, Yuan again went to the factory to cause trouble. The factory owner, Zhu Jintai, from Jingjiang, turned him over to the Ninglu Police Station, and he was sentenced to two days of detention. After being released at noon on the 7th, Yuan gathered more than twenty people from his hometown and stormed the factory, severely beating Zhu unconscious. Fortunately, an apprentice, Wang Ronggen, boldly reported the incident to the East Fahua Police Station. Officers were dispatched to the scene and arrested the ringleader, Zhen Hanzhang, and accomplices Wang Jinshan, Zhi Jun, Xuan Shaokun, You Qing, Bao Changfu, and six others. The injured Zhu Jintai was taken to the Red Cross Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with a ruptured liver, and his life is in critical condition.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Yulin, a mere seventeen years old, a refugee from Shenyang, resides at No. 18, Lane 256, Jiangsu Road in this city. On May 9th this year, around 4 p.m., he secretly stole two cameras and legal tender from his home and fled to Nanjing. He handed one of the Spasex cameras to Zhan Changchi of China Trust Business for sale, who then sold it to Qiao Wenxi, who was unaware of the theft. Qiao resold it to Cheng Bingkai, who asked Zhu Guohua of Wenlong Used Goods Store to sell it for him. Li's father discovered the theft, reported it to the police, and the camera was recovered. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, and Li Yulin and Zhan Changchi were indicted on charges of theft and receiving stolen goods. The District Court held a hearing yesterday, with only Li Yulin appearing. He confessed: "My father wouldn't give me money, and he said that the educational level in the Northeast was low. I wanted to come south to attend school, but he wouldn't let me. So I stole the camera to find a way to get into school." The court asked: "Does your father still want to press charges?" Li replied: "Perhaps he won't anymore." The court then announced that he would be exempt from punishment, and Zhan Changchi's case was transferred to the Capital Court for trial.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Shen, an engineer at the International Hotel, reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct on June 21st that a typewriter had been stolen and requested an investigation. Chief Du of the precinct assigned the Judicial Section to investigate. Section Chief Yu dispatched police officers Huang Jiaqi and Gao Shaoshan, who discovered a similar typewriter at the Wu Tianxing Used Goods Store on Carter Road. The manager, Cheng Bingkai, said that a man named Xia Jing, claiming to be a reporter, had sold it for 60 million yuan. On the 27th, Cheng encountered Xia Jing on the road and turned him over to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Xia, who claimed to be 25 years old, from Nanchang, residing at No. 8, Jiyang Road, Qingdao, and employed by the Qingdao Minbao Newspaper, said he had arrived in Shanghai on June 3rd and brought two typewriters from Qingdao. One was sold to Wu Tianxing, and the other to Wenji Typewriter Shop on Jiangxi Road, for a total of 105 million yuan. The two machines belonged to Chang Qing, a reporter at the Qingdao Hezong News Agency, who had borrowed a camera from him and not returned it, so he had kept the two typewriters as collateral. Wu Yimin, the owner of the Jindu Securities Company, posted bail for him. The police department sent a telegram to Qingdao to verify the truth. They received a reply stating that Xia had worked in the advertising department of the Minbao for a short time and had been fired for misconduct, that he had not borrowed a camera, and that Chang Qing had lost a typewriter and requested an investigation. The police station summoned the bailer, Wu Yimin, to question Xia's whereabouts, but he had disappeared. After being released on bail, Xia changed his name to Xie Xin and frequented dance halls and pleasure houses, indulging in entertainment. On the evening of July 1st, he took a woman to dinner at the Xueyuan Laozhengxing Restaurant on West Zhongzheng Road. Section Chief Yu Ding saw him and secretly telegraphed the precinct, which dispatched patrolman Yuan Zhenzhi and police officer Lu Foguang to arrest him and take him to the station for questioning. Xia falsely claimed to be the son of Xia Wei, the commander of the Eighth Pacification District. After discovering his deception, the police questioned him exhaustively for several days and nights. He confessed that he had arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on June 3rd and stayed at the Dahua Hotel. Later, running out of funds, he sold his clothes. One day, he went to the Gongli Hospital on Luban Road, claiming to have a stomach ache. In the X-ray room, he found a typewriter and stole it, hiding it under his raincoat, and sold it to Wu Tianding for 60 million yuan. On June 5th, he fraudulently obtained another typewriter from Zhu Bolin, a staff member of the Public Welfare Auction House on Nanjing Xin Street, and sold it to the Wenhua Typewriter Shop for 105 million yuan. The stolen goods have now been recovered and returned to their original owners. The suspect was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Face of Lushan, the Summer Capital <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liu Wentong</p>
<p>[Kuling, Lushan, July 5th Air Mail] Lushan is like a garden belonging to a wealthy family. However, this wealthy family is now experiencing financial difficulties. Although they have their own garden, they cannot afford to cultivate it properly.</p>
<p>The Lushan Administration is directly under the Jiangxi Provincial Government. The Provincial Government can only provide limited funds, enough to maintain operations in the winter, but not in the summer. Every summer, it requires subsidies from the central government. When Director Wang Zuomin of the Administration took office this spring, he made great efforts to obtain 2 billion yuan to manage this year's summer capital. Three months ago, 2 billion yuan was still valuable and could be used to buy things and do things. For example, Wang Zuomin bought a large amount of diesel fuel to enable the power plant to provide electricity for three months.</p>
<p>A Clever Wife Cannot Cook Without Rice</p>
<p>The chief secretary of the Administration told me that the main tasks in Lushan are public security, sanitation, and transportation. A police station with more than a hundred officers and a company of military police maintain the security of Lushan. The Administration employs a group of sanitation workers to maintain cleanliness. Two thousand porters support the transportation up and down the mountain. All these things cost money. There are other things that should be done, but a clever wife cannot cook without rice.</p>
<p>The Lushan Hospital, which enjoyed a great reputation before the war, now belongs to the Jiujiang Hospital and is the only medical institution on the mountain. Due to lack of funds, it has become a summer resort hospital. It opens in the summer and closes in the winter. Equipment, facilities, and medicine are all inadequate. When Ding Guitang's daughter-in-law fell from a building and was injured, there was not even a plaster bed on the mountain, so she had to be taken to Jiujiang Hospital for treatment. The only twenty beds were filled with lung disease patients. Every day, many poorly dressed ordinary people came up and down the mountain to seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>The banks here are experiencing a cash shortage.</p>
<p>Except for the Jiangxi Provincial Bank, which operates year-round as an agent for the provincial treasury, other banks come to serve vacationers and only operate on the mountain for three months. The Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank have already opened. The Central Bank and the Bank of Communications are also preparing to open. They mainly handle remittances and deposits. People spend money on the mountain, so there are more inward remittances than outward remittances, and most depositors deposit money when it is remitted in and slowly withdraw it. Therefore, the task of the banks is simply to supply banknotes. In the past week, there has been a severe shortage of cash in Kuling. Jiujiang and Nanchang, which supply Kuling, are also experiencing cash shortages. Bank officials are rushing around anxiously for cash. The Shanghai Bank sent a special person down the mountain, asking for 4 billion, but only received 500 million. An old foreign woman only wanted to withdraw 16 million and had to make two or three trips. It is said that the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications are ready to open, but they do not dare to go up the mountain because they do not have cash.</p>
<p>It is said that the exchange rate for telegraphic transfers from Shanghai to Kuling has been as high as 30%.</p>
<p>The cash that goes out of the banks does not come back. Where does the money go? Some people say that the money is being exchanged for silver dollars. As a result, large amounts of banknotes go down the mountain and are distributed to Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Guangdong. While one person sends money, another person takes it away. The faster the banknotes travel, the poorer people become.</p>
<p>The fire in Kuling last spring devastated the area, and it has not recovered this year. The main street, the new street, and the lower street are still in ruins. The shops rebuilt in the ruins, from gold shops to small food shops, are certainly complete, but there are no large-scale businesses.</p>
<p>The main businesses are restaurants, but they are all deserted. There are two gold shops. One is repairing its storefront in preparation for opening, and the other is already open. A few days ago, there was an incident involving the sale of gold that was not up to standard. Imported goods are 20% to 30%, or even 70% to 80%, more expensive than in Shanghai. Jingdezhen porcelain is surprisingly expensive. A set of dining and tea utensils, large and small, more than 190 pieces, sells for more than 100 million yuan. The staff at the coffee shops are so idle that they sit on the counter and doze off. The furniture business is also very slow.</p>
<p>Cultural Undertakings Show Signs of Decline</p>
<p>There is a lack of demand for spiritual food. Among the three bookstores, one specializes in selling new Shanghai books and periodicals. Only thirty to fifty magazines can be sold, and the sales of books are very few. The Commercial Press is located inside the social service center and can only sell several million yuan worth of books a day. The price of books is roughly 20% to 30% higher than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The only newspaper that can be seen every day is the Jiujiang Daily. The Lushan editions of the Central Daily News and the Lixing Daily from the previous year, and the Lushan Daily from last year, have become memories worth recalling. The Jiujiang Daily is a broadsheet printed on rough paper. It arrives in Kuling every afternoon, with a circulation of only seventy copies. The Chinese New Daily and the Republican Daily from Nanchang are seen only every other day, so their circulation is even smaller. Newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai cannot be seen here.</p>
<p>There are no entertainment venues on the mountain. In the only dance hall, a gramophone plays popular songs, but there are very few people dancing. The swimming pool is open, but the water is too cold, so only some foreigners go into the water.</p>

<p>[Fengxian, July 7th] The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has a sub-branch in Fengxian, headed by Shi Tairen. On the 31st of last month, the Provincial Bank suddenly sent Nie Wenzhi to Fengxian to audit the accounts. They discovered that a Xin Yu Company in Nanshan had pledged two large packages of tree ears for a large loan that was overdue. Nie personally went to the company to inquire and learned that the owner of the company had not taken out the loan. The loan was forged and impersonated. Further investigation of other companies' pledge loans revealed that they were also largely inaccurate. The local newspapers unanimously criticized the incident, hoping to prompt the Provincial Agricultural authorities to deal with it.</p>

<p>[Beiping, July 9th] More than one hundred students from Shenyang Middle School in Northeast China currently reside in Ping Luzu Temple. On the night of the 8th, the student union held a general meeting. When the chairman, Tang Liyuan, was reporting on student welfare, a student named Liao Shuquan expressed dissatisfaction and rebutted him, leading to an argument. Liao raised an axe, threatening Tang, and was dissuaded by other students. However, he continued to express his dissatisfaction. Another student, Jia Wenjin, advised Liao not to act impulsively. Liao, harboring resentment, went to the kitchen, took out a kitchen knife, and stabbed Jia twice in the chest, causing Jia to fall to the ground. Liao then stabbed Jia twice in the back, causing serious injuries. The students immediately turned Liao Shuquan over to the police station, demanding that he be investigated according to the law.</p>

<p>[Nanjing, July 9th] A bizarre story occurred in the Guantou area outside Shuixi Gate in Nanjing City on the 9th, where an incident over a popsicle escalated into a son beating his mother, and the mother and father jointly accusing their son of robbery. The father's name is Tang Yihe, the mother's name is Wang, and the son's name is Tang Zhifu. Wang bought a popsicle for her younger son because of the hot weather. Zhifu questioned Wang, asking why she didn't buy one for him. An argument ensued, and he beat his mother. The younger brother reported his older brother to the police, who came to arrest him. Tang Yihe and Wang both stated that their son was not only disobedient and unfilial but also often beat his parents and was connected to bandits in the Dangtu-Jiangning area. He had even participated in kidnapping with a gang, and his wife, Zhang Yuzhi, had been robbed. Zhang Yuzhi stated that she originally had a husband named Ma Shaowu, who was an officer in the Dangtu-Jiangning security team and had also been a bandit. He was killed by Zhang Zichun, a bandit, who then took possession of her. Later, Tang Zhifu robbed her from Zhang Zichun and brought her to Nanjing. Zhang stated that she was often beaten in Nanjing and often saw Tang beat his mother. The police station often sent Zhifu to the Capital District Court Prosecutor's Office for prosecution.</p>

<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 4th] The Jiangxi Land Administration Bureau, in order to restrict the gradual concentration of privately owned land area, has formulated implementation measures, which are being studied and promoted by the provincial government. The measures stipulate:</p>
<p>(1) The target of restriction is based on households, and the household registration book shall be the standard. However, cooperatives, ancestral halls, churches, schools, temples, companies, and various groups may have their true household names investigated, with the household name on the grain tax register as the standard.</p>
<p>(2) Cultivated land refers to both paddy fields and dry land. The maximum limit for private cultivated land owned by individuals is: (1) Paddy fields: each household shall not exceed 50 mu of superior land, or 75 mu of medium land, or 100 mu of inferior land. (2) Dry land shall be doubled in quantity compared to superior, medium, and inferior paddy fields. (3) For those with both paddy and dry land, the calculation shall be based on the above-mentioned ratio. (Each household is based on a population of ten, excluding employees; those exceeding ten may be increased proportionally).</p>
<p>(3) The area of privately owned land of cooperatives, ancestral halls, churches, schools, temples, companies, and various groups shall be determined according to their nature and scope.</p>
<p>(4) The standard classification of cultivated land grades is as follows: (1) For paddy fields, those with a yield of 500 catties or more per mu are considered superior, those with a yield of 300 catties or more are considered medium, and those with less than 300 catties are considered inferior. (2) The division of dry land into superior, medium, and inferior grades shall be determined by county and municipal governments based on actual conditions, annual income, and with reference to the aforementioned regulations.</p>
<p>(5) The total area of private cultivated land per household shall be based on the grain tax register or the consolidated household register, the land price tax register, and the household's land deed. The county and municipal governments shall collect the total area of excess cultivated land of each household, as well as its type, grade, location, and compile a registration book, which shall be distributed to each township office to notify the household heads concerned.</p>
<p>(6) After being notified, the household head shall, within 30 days, in accordance with the limits in Articles 5 and 6, list and declare to the township office the type, grade, area, location, etc., of the cultivated land they voluntarily retain and the excess cultivated land they sell, which shall be forwarded to the municipal and county governments for approval. The name of the household and the area, type, grade, location, etc., of the excess cultivated land they sell shall be listed separately and announced in front of the local township office for farmers to purchase.</p>
<p>(7) When cultivated land is sold, the buyers shall be: (1) The original tenant farmers or hired laborers cultivating the land. (2) Retired soldiers with farming ability and families of soldiers who fought in the war of resistance. (3) Tenant farmers and hired laborers in the village. (4) Tenant farmers and hired laborers in the township. (5) Self-cultivating farmers in the township. (6) The village production cooperative or township office.

<h3 id="e110">Large Gap on Xietu Road <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Funds Should Be Used to Level the Road for Easier Traffic</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ba and Jun Liangyun stated: Xietu Road in this city is the only way for long-distance buses to Songhu, Minhang, and Hangzhou, as well as cargo vehicles to Zhapu, Hangzhou, and other highways. Traffic is frequent on weekdays, but since the Jinzhou Bicycle Factory connected water pipes, the road has been sunk into two large gaps. When cars pass by, they often jolt violently. If it is a heavy vehicle, the iron plate is easily broken, which not only makes driving inconvenient, but also has a close relationship with the safety of passengers. Previously, the authorities of the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Company sent workers to fill the road with soil, but it is said that they were prevented by the factory. As the area is under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, it should be requested that the relevant department of the bureau immediately investigate and order the factory to fill the road as soon as possible. This matter concerns driving safety and public safety. Please publish this in your newspaper to promote the attention of the relevant parties and remedy the situation. Sincerely, to the Social Services Department of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Patients with Ascites Seeking Effective Medical Treatment</p>
<p>Editor: My mother has been suffering from ascites for two years. Recently, her abdomen has become increasingly enlarged, and she is in critical condition. Although she has been treated by both Chinese and Western doctors, all treatments have been ineffective. I am a poor civil servant with a very meager monthly income, and the amount spent on medical expenses is already huge, leaving me with no financial resources to bear further expenses. I would like to borrow a corner of your column to ask those who have suffered from this disease and recovered for an effective medical prescription, or to introduce an experienced doctor, so that I can find a way to seek treatment again, so that my mother can escape the sea of suffering. If you approve, it will be an immeasurable act of merit. Reader Sheng Kuisheng respectfully. Address: No. 274, Lane 274, (25) Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>The rice market turned down due to increased arrivals. Rice shops were weak in receiving, the outgoing road was stagnant, quotations in Wuxi were also weak, and people's hearts were weak, so prices fell.

<p>After the export merchants here repeatedly requested increased tea prices for green teas such as Chou Zhen Zhen Mei, to which the foreign firms in the foreign tea market were reluctant to pay, it is heard that some have now been approved. Therefore, buying enthusiasm has returned, and the process has suddenly become active after being stagnant for a long time. In terms of prices, holders are reluctant to release their goods lightly due to high costs, so they remain sharp. As for Qimen black tea, British merchants continued to try to purchase it smoothly, but the market inventory was depleted, and supply could not meet demand, so the situation was stable in the quiet. As for domestic sales tea, there were some imports and exports, but there was a lack of change.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): The Chinese basketball team, in the third group elimination round for 17th place—which the British, in their fine-sounding words, call the third championship—the first to eighth places being the first championship, and the ninth to sixteenth places being the second championship—defeated Switzerland by a score of 42 to 34. The Chinese team, after falling from a shared group championship to fifth place, was undoubtedly greatly affected. The players' morale was scattered, a far cry from the demeanor when competing against first-class powerhouses like Chile, Belgium, and Korea. At the end of the first half, the score was 25 to 20, China leading by five points. After the start of the second half, Switzerland scored four consecutive points. China only had Wu Chengzhang make a basket under the net. Afterwards, Bao Songmao committed a foul, and Switzerland scored a point from the free throw, creating a tense situation where the difference was only one point, 25 to 27. After the audience frequently cheered them on, the Chinese team slightly rallied. Li Shiqiao and Cai Wenhua repeatedly made long shots, all hitting the target. Wu Chengzhang also gradually became more active. Switzerland exerted all their strength to compete, and the battle became more intense. Finally, China won by four points, with a score of 42 to 34.</p>
<p>Although Switzerland's skills are not as good as China's, their consistent fighting spirit far surpasses China's. In this battle, the Chinese team's formation was chaotic, with no direction in attack or retreat. In terms of defense, there were especially many loopholes. Bao Songmao's problem of straying far from his defensive position reappeared repeatedly. It was only because the opponent was not strong. The Chinese team repeatedly substituted players, but it was still difficult to stimulate the flagging morale. China will meet Great Britain, which has already defeated Ireland, tomorrow afternoon. Italy has also defeated Iraq and will face Egypt, which had a bye in the first week.</p>

When the regular time ended, each team had 42 points. The five-minute overtime resulted in a score of 53 to 52. France won by one point in a very thrilling game. France will compete with the winner of the Brazil-Czechoslovakia match for the championship final.</p>
<p>Chinese Basketball Team Still Lacking in Methods</p>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 9th dispatch] Among the most unforgettable moments in the World Olympics basketball competition is the match between China and Korea. All World Olympics basketball games are held in the indoor arena in northern London called Haringey, which has comfortable seating for 11,000 spectators. Basketball has not yet become a popular sport in Great Britain, so the arena rarely has more than one-tenth of its seats filled. However, since the start of the World Olympics basketball competition, the number of spectators has been increasing daily. When China and Korea competed in basketball, the number of spectators was between 1,500 and 2,000.</p>
<p>Compared with the previous two matches against Belgium and Chile, the Chinese team has made progress in the following areas: First, the success rate of free throws has greatly increased. Second, it can consolidate the rear defense when the time and situation become increasingly tense. After the Koreans get the ball, our team retreats to defend, often adopting a relaxed five-person defensive formation. The Koreans constantly break through using a swift two-person combination method, which is one person dribbling and dashing forward, and when they can no longer advance, they turn and throw the ball to the second person. The latter gets the ball and immediately shoots. This combination method disrupts the five-person defensive formation, causing the second person to often no longer be monitored by us. As a result, the Koreans made three out of four shots. Every time the Chinese team's score approaches the Korean team to within three to five points, the Koreans immediately score one or two baskets with the speed of escaping rabbits. When the situation became increasingly critical, our team abandoned the relaxed five-person defensive method and used "guard your man" as a slogan, and the Koreans' attempts began to be thwarted.</p>
<p>Although we defeated Korea, the individual skills of the players are good, but there are many areas in the linking and passing aspects that need improvement. Our actions are slow, causing the opposing team to succeed in regaining the ball and consolidating their defense. We still have no method or system to break through the five-person defensive formation. To date, we rely too much on standing and passing the ball, as well as ineffective shooting. The former only wastes time, and the latter is fraught with difficulties. The above are the actual reasons for the defeat against the Philippines by a score of 51 to 32 the following evening. The Philippine team's overall connection work is superior to our team's. They have a prescribed system and method, both of which are offensive and defensive. We can still achieve improvement in this area in a short period of time.</p>

<p>[British News Agency, 9th dispatch] Chen Yinglang, the Chinese National Games champion, participated in the 400-meter race. This race was divided into eleven or twelve groups, with a total of 70 athletes. The fastest time was 48.3 seconds, and the slowest time was 51.4 seconds. Chen finished third in the first group of six, maintaining his National Games record with 50.9 seconds. A Yugoslav athlete won second place with 50.5 seconds. Because only two people from each group are allowed to participate in the semi-finals, Chen was eliminated. However, viewed from the high point of the stadium, Chen's running posture was excellent, and he did not slacken a step throughout the race.</p>

<h3 id="e134">An Old Story About Women's High Jump Runner-Up, Mrs. Dael <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 8th (broadcast): The women's high jump champion, Alice Coachman from the United States, is a black female sports star. She and the runner-up, Mrs. Dael from Great Britain, both broke the World Olympics record with a score of 1.68 meters. Coachman cleared the height in one jump, while Dael cleared it in two jumps, which is how the rankings were determined. Twelve years ago, the World Olympics were held in Berlin. Dael was unmarried and was still Miss Dorothy Odam. She participated in the women's high jump and also achieved the same score as the champion from Hungary. The rankings were also determined by the number of attempts, and she finished as the runner-up. The two events are strikingly similar. Is Mrs. Dael perhaps destined to never be the champion? The third place in this year's competition was France's Micheline Ostermeyer, with 1.61 meters. The fourth place was Jamaica's Vinton Beckett, the fifth place was Canada's Patricia Trainor, and the sixth place was Great Britain's Kroonseh, all with 1.58 meters.</p>
<p>Irvine, the black American male sprint star, finished as the runner-up in both the 100-meter and 200-meter races. He reached the finish line at the same time as Patton in the 200-meter race, with the same score, but was judged to be in second place. He and Mrs. Dael can be said to be in the same boat.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Rowing Competition is Heated <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th dispatch] The University of Washington four-oared rowing team (with coxswain), representing the United States, sped forward on the 9th, defeating Switzerland and Denmark to take first place. At the same time, the focus of the World Olympics competition has shifted to the historic banks of the Thames River, where spectators lined the shores to watch the rowing finals. There are a total of three events, and the United States hopes to sweep all three championships. So far, they have won one. The United States team's time was 6 minutes 50.3 seconds, Switzerland was second with 6 minutes 53.3 seconds, and Denmark was third with 6 minutes 56.8 seconds. The entire course was 1,900 meters. At the start of the race, the United States and Denmark started with 40 strokes per minute, while Switzerland only had 38 strokes per minute. At 50 meters, Switzerland was first, and the United States was second. At 500 yards, the United States and Denmark were neck and neck, with Switzerland still in the lead. At 750 meters, Switzerland was only leading by two feet, and Denmark was slightly ahead of the United States. Switzerland maintained the lead at 1,200 meters.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): The United States team was disqualified in the 400-meter relay final, and the British team replaced them. According to track and field judges, the second runner, Laider, crossed the designated exchange zone when handing the baton to the first runner, Irvine. The United States team's head coach, Cromwell, immediately filed a formal protest. The appellate review committee originally planned to screen the 400-meter relay film on Sunday to observe and decide whether the United States team had committed a foul. It is now known that the screening of the film has been postponed to Tuesday. According to the United States, the film shows that the United States team did not commit a foul. However, Cassilliona-Ade, the Olympic film producer, said that the film he shot clearly shows that the United States team committed a foul and should be disqualified.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Chinese World Olympics Basketball Team Sacrificed Under the Current System; International Basketball Federation Discussing Revision of Regulations <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th (broadcast): In this tournament, the Chinese basketball team and the Korean team were in the same group, and both scored eight points. Moreover, China even defeated Korea. However, Korea is now ranked in the top eight, and even if China wins every match in the third elimination round, they will at most get 17th place. This is an example that proves that in the current competition system, fate controls everything.</p>
<p>In two weeks, it is undoubtedly difficult to judge the merits of more than 20 teams. This time's round-robin elimination system is relatively complete, but the result is still not good. China's sacrifice is an example. Many countries believe that the decisiveness of fate in this system is even greater than that shown in the double-elimination system.</p>
<p>Since failing to adopt double-elimination in 1936, the International Amateur Basketball Association has been researching, hoping to obtain a more ideal and fair competition system, so that the competition can reach the fairest possible point within the possible scope. However, twelve years of exploration have still failed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the congress representatives and the directors of the International Amateur Basketball Association have scheduled a joint meeting today (10th) to discuss the competition method to be used in the next World Olympics in 1952. A perfect competition system cannot of course be produced in a couple of hours. Today's meeting is limited to a discussion of principles. Branch details will have to be deeply discussed by the Basketball Association. Revisions to basketball rules to suit the American fast system, and fouls, etc., will also be on the agenda of the meeting.</p>
<p>World Olympics Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e138">Ancient London Has a New Atmosphere; Chinese Athletes Are in Good Spirits <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Special Correspondence for This Newspaper, London] July 25th (Sunday). In extreme haste, this reporter took the 8:05 am express train from Paris, crossed the English Channel, and arrived at London Victoria Station at 4:40 pm. Everywhere in the station were posters and advertisements for the World Olympics, as well as colorful and eye-catching flags welcoming athletes from various countries, which added a new atmosphere to this ancient and old station. On Piccadilly Circus, the busiest area in central London, the statue of Cupid was also surrounded by colorful flags participating in the World Olympics. It is rare to see the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag abroad, but it was actually waving in the wind, flying in the airspace of Great Britain, which made the Chinese people very excited. On the road, one can constantly encounter athletes in uniforms selected from various countries. The number of tourists to England has also suddenly increased several times. The streets of London are crowded with colorful foreign tourists, and most hotels have "full" signs hanging up. All the shops are doing thriving business and making ten thousand times their profits. However, apart from luxury goods that can be sold freely and without limit, all daily necessities and food are still very strictly controlled, so their prices have not been affected by the World Olympics and have not risen sharply, which makes the British citizens in a state of material hardship feel even more pain.</p>
<p>The office of the Chinese delegation is located in the Marble Arch area at the Mount Royal Hotel. The athletes' dormitory is in a quieter area in the south of London (Kilburn) on Priory Park Road at the Kilburn Polytechnic School. The school is a new-style five-story Western-style building with a brown artificial stone facade. The Olympic flag and a huge Chinese national flag are hanging on the roof, which feels solemn and simple. Outside the door were crowded British children driven by curiosity, waiting for the athletes to sign their names. The basement of the building has been converted into a restaurant. The first floor is a conference room (because the office at the Royal Hotel has been canceled) and a reception room. A huge national flag is hung in the center of the room, and the table is filled with promotional materials from British travel agencies. From the second to the fifth floors are the athletes' bedrooms, with about ten people in a room. Small iron beds are arranged in two rows, neatly and beautifully. The nutrition of the athletes is not a problem, because a large number of vermicelli, ham, pickles, preserved eggs, mushrooms, and other foods have been shipped from China in advance, and the conference also has Chinese cooks who provide exquisite and delicious Chinese dishes every day. The athletes' lives are very disciplined. Every morning, they must take a bus to the training ground for practice. During the day, they go to the training ground to practice or observe the training of athletes from other countries and the competitions of other teams. They must return to the dormitory before 11:00 pm so that the athletes can have sufficient rest. Therefore, the athletes are all in good spirits and excited.</p>
<p>Foreigners also respect our selection of athletes. Although no item has been formally selected to win, it is generally believed that the performance of the Chinese athletes is not bad, especially for the glorious battle of Chinese basketball, which is highly praised. Although our football team suffered a crushing defeat as soon as it appeared, it was defeated by Turkey, which is known for its reputation in Europe, and is also well-forgiven. The battle in the friendly match with the tall and elite American World Olympics team at the Oxbridge Stadium at 5:00 pm on July 26th is especially worthy of praise by the world. Tickets were also sold for the game. In the first half, the American team welcomed two goals, which made the athletes of the New World happy in their expressions. Later, He Yingfen on our left wing pulled back a goal, making it 1 to 2. Our country was slightly frustrated in the first half. In the second half, our team cooperated and launched a fierce attack. Center forward Zhu Yongqiang made a special surprise shot and scored a goal, making it a 2-to-1 draw. The spirit of our country's athletes was even more uplifted, and after a long time of fierce fighting, He Yingfen scored another goal, resulting in a 3-to-2 comeback victory. On the first test in a foreign country, they defeated the excellent American team, and public opinion was divided, all believing that Chinese football has a lot of hope. Who knows that God does not help people, and in both draws, they met Turkey. The passionate support of the overseas Chinese for the athletes is that the motherland, after decades of war, is now facing new economic panic and all kinds of difficulties, but with great determination, under the lack of financial and material resources, resolutely convened the first National Games after the war to select the World Olympics athletes, which is so exciting. Although we have not been able to return with honors this time, we have left a good impression on foreigners. Moreover, the experience gained from this observation and research is enough to be the foundation for promoting sports in our country in the future. It is hoped that in the next World Olympics four years later, our country's achievements can keep pace with the wheels of the times, raise our eyebrows and exhale, and win glory for the motherland.</p>

The salaries of teachers and staff will be doubled compared to last year's monthly salary and paid monthly, adjusted with prices, with the highest earners receiving about seven dan of rice.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Shanghai University administration, in view of the fact that in the past, after new students were admitted, they often transferred to other schools before or after the start of school, thus affecting the school authorities' ability to determine the number of places that should be reserved, has now decided that after this admission of new students, they must pay a place reservation fee equivalent to one shi of rice price at the start of the academic year</p>

<h3 id="e149">Random Notes from Airing Books <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Aside from a few books in my collection, it can be said that I am utterly impoverished. Although ancient poets often expressed an "Ah Q" spirit with sayings like "having books is not poverty," boiling words cannot satisfy hunger. When things get desperate, I can only endure the complaints of my wife and children.</p>
<p>I seem to recall a few excellent lines about poverty and buying books in Yuan Mei's "Suiyuan Shihua." The weather is so hot that I don't have the courage to look them up, and my memory for poetry is terrible. I only vaguely remember Yuan himself having a line: "When well-fed, I worry about going to the market; when my family is poor, I dream of buying books." This feeling is very real, and it remains so even now. Some people compare books to food, but there is a fundamental difference between the two. When extremely hungry, grass roots, tree bark, and kaolin clay can all be used to fill the stomach, but books cannot be compromised in this way. One would rather not read than indulge in inferior, nauseating works. Anyone with a fondness for reading generally has a tendency to respect their own interests, and this cannot be denied. Therefore, if there are good books that one cannot buy, one will indeed "think about them day and night." Over the years, the price of blank newsprint has increased almost twenty millionfold. Publishers are unwilling to print books, and they are unwilling to sell them at low prices. The market reflects a lack of quantity and weak purchasing power. Despite book prices rising every three days and changing every five, bookstores are deserted. Having goods without being able to sell them is futile. Thus, those who dream can only dream forever, and those who lose money have no way to recoup it. The things we cannot obtain even in our dreams are the very things they cannot get rid of, no matter what. "Jean-Christophe" and "Nana" weep silently in the warehouses, while young students suffer unrequited love. This alone is enough to illustrate the unreasonableness of everything.</p>
<p>Collecting books is also a problem now. First, there is the matter of housing. In Shanghai, it's measured in gold bars; in Nanjing and other cities, it's measured in white rice. We certainly cannot afford to spend one shi and five dou of rice to rent a room for books, so we can only let them suffer a bit in the bedroom. Second, there are the bookshelves. Even the cheapest glass cabinet costs fifty million, and a bamboo or wicker shelf costs over ten million. We sometimes even have trouble finding a place to sleep, so how can we possibly find a place for them? Since all of this is out of the question, can we even call it collecting books? What a pathetic sight!</p>
<p>However, mice and bookworms show no mercy. A copy of the "Sanxitang Calligraphy Collection" has had its last volume eaten clean, perhaps to serve as swaddling clothes for a young mouse master. Fortunately, they showed restraint and didn't dig a large hole through the middle volume. The "Guiyi Leigao" and manuscript newspapers are covered in spiderwebs, with insect eggs suspended on yellowed silk threads, as if this learned and insightful man from three hundred years ago had also suffered misfortune.</p>
<p>There's no other way but to move the bed out and expose it to the ninety-degree sunlight outside for disinfection. Zhu Zhuyu had the Pavilion for Airing Books, and Qian Yiji also wrote "Miscellaneous Notes on Airing Books." I can only call this an airing-book couch. Although it's simple, spreading the books out on it feels like reuniting with old friends after a long separation. Each book contains a complex and moving story, which can serve as one of my "summer pastimes."</p>
<p>I am someone who cannot specialize. My reading is broad and unrefined—perhaps this is the root cause of my lack of accomplishment? The things being aired before me contain several contradictions. It's not just the head-on collision of "Hanxue Shicheng Ji" versus "Hanxue Shangdui." For example, from the far-right "Mein Kampf" to the far-left "Biography of Marx," it is worth studying both. I also like to buy both Chinese herbal-style plant catalogs and the latest cataloged plant atlases, in order to compare the traces of progress to some extent. Perhaps in my miscellaneous studies, I cannot avoid a historical bias. I only regret that China does not have someone as knowledgeable and profound as Sir Fraser, who could write a great and detailed general history of customs and habits, like "The Golden Bough." Even the defeated Japanese are willing to put in hard work when it comes to scholarship. No wonder the magnificent dozens of volumes of "Korean Ancient Relics Atlas" and "Chinese Historical Relics Atlas" are valued in gold bars. Has anyone in China ever done such a labor-intensive work? Sir Stein's "Thousand Buddhas" and "Ancient Khotan," to me, are like Yuan Mei's poems—I can only glimpse their glorious appearance in dreams.</p>
<p>The entire Earth is currently sinking. Perhaps it is because of this that I feel the old historical relics are so lovely and precious. It's a pity that we ourselves cannot talk about any decent publications now. Even in times of peace, we have never had any amazing achievements. This year, the Academia Sinica finally printed a copy of "Xiaotun" (i.e., the first volume of inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin) to give us a little face, but I fear it will be difficult to continue. Looking at the publications on the street newsstands, which are as thin as a consumptive patient in the third stage of tuberculosis, one cannot help but wonder if Chinese culture is only left with these skeletal remains. Without mentioning anything else, just looking at American publications like "The Saturday Evening Post" and "Look," one will feel like one is on the verge of death, even if they are full of advertisements and pornography, don't they still have that extra energy?</p>
<h3 id="e150">What I Know of Wu Qingyuan (Part 1) <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Fen Yun's article "Also on Wu Qingyuan" in this column, which recounts Wu Qingyuan's chess match with the Japanese at Qingyun Pavilion in 1927, which was extremely interesting. I happened to be in Beiping at the time. Although I did not participate in the grand event at Qingyun Pavilion, according to what I heard, the person who played chess with Wu Qingyuan was not the sixth-dan master that Cao Rulin brought from Japan, nor was it the seventh-dan Yue Yingzuo mentioned by Yu Shoujun. It was actually the fifth-dan Japanese player, Inoue Kohei. The meeting between Inoue fifth-dan and Qingyuan at Qingyun Pavilion was jointly sponsored by the Beiping Weiqi (Go) enthusiasts. The owner of Qingyun Pavilion, Han Shenxian (Xia Shanlou Master), was also fond of this art and was willing to use a part of the upstairs as the venue. One year before this meeting, Iwamoto sixth-dan and Kosugi fourth-dan from the Japanese Go Institute visited Beiping and hosted a welcome chess match at Wansui House in Babao Hutong, Dongcheng. Liu Dihuai, Gu Shuiru, and Wu Qingyuan (thirteen years old) attended. Iwamoto played against Liu Dihuai, giving him a two-stone handicap, and Liu won. He then played against Gu Shuiru, giving him a two-stone handicap, and Gu lost. Finally, Iwamoto sixth-dan played against Qingyuan, giving him a three-stone handicap, and Qingyuan won. Therefore, Qingyuan's reputation in Go was already known to the Japanese when he was thirteen years old. The fact that the Chinese side chose Qingyuan to play against someone above the fifth-dan at the Qingyun Pavilion was a coincidence, and it was not because Liu Dihuai and others were afraid of Inoue and dared not compete with him.</p>
<p>At that time, Inoue and Wu Qingyuan played three games in total. The first game was at Qingyun Pavilion in November 1927, when Qingyuan was fourteen years old. He played black first and the game ended in "interruption" (a Japanese Go term meaning unfinished game). Two days later, the two played again at Li Lvge's house, and Qingyuan won by "nakaoshi" (another Japanese Go term). Two days after that, the two played again at Zhang Boju's house, and Inoue Kohei won by nakaoshi. At that time, there was a Japanese businessman in Beiping named Yamazaki Yumin who was also fond of Go. He sent the scores of these three games back to Japan to Yasui Senkaku, who was a seventh-dan player. Yasui was greatly surprised when he saw them, believing that Wu Qingyuan was only fourteen years old, yet had such skill in Go, with the style of the young Honinbo Shusaku, the national Go saint. Thus, he developed the idea of inviting Qingyuan to Japan. Later, Qingyuan went to Japan and joined the Japanese Go Institute, which was based on the three games he played with Inoue fifth-dan.</p>
<p>Once Yasui had the intention of inviting Qingyuan to Japan, he sent his student Hashimoto Utaro (fourth-dan) to Beiping in 1928 to test Qingyuan's strength. Hashimoto played two games with Qingyuan and reported back to his teacher, praising Qingyuan's Go skills greatly. Thus, the name of the Chinese genius Go prodigy Wu Qingyuan spread throughout Japan, and Yasui's intention to invite Qingyuan to Japan became even more firm. At the time, Inukai Tsuyoshi, Makino Nobuaki, Okura Kihachiro, and Mochizuki Keisuke also had the same idea. There were many exchanges of letters between Tokyo and Beiping, all handled by Yamazaki Yumin. When Yoshizawa Kenkichi (Inukai Tsuyoshi's son-in-law) became the Chinese minister, the plan for Qingyuan to travel to Japan took a sharp turn for the better and was largely decided. When Okura Kihachiro agreed to pay for all of Qingyuan's living expenses in Japan, Qingyuan, along with his mother and his brother Wu Huan, set off from Tianjin on the Chang'an Maru. During the journey, major newspapers such as the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun and the Jiji Shinpo competed to report his journey with large-character headlines such as "The Qilin Child Wu Qingyuan Arrives" and "The Rare Great Genius Wu Qingyuan." When the train arrived at Tokyo Station, Honinbo Shusai, Yasui Senkaku's followers, the director of the Japanese Go Institute, Yata Kyosuke, and many other famous figures in the Japanese Go world were all at the station to welcome him. The scene was unprecedentedly grand.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Fireflies <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>The elegant affair of "flitting fireflies with a light silk fan" is something everyone has experienced in childhood.</p>
<p>On cool summer nights, specks of firefly light drift everywhere, like celestial maidens winking their pretty eyes, emitting a faint green glow that is so gentle and serene, composing the beauty of summer nights.</p>
<p>Fireflies never fly into halls, rooms, or any other places with lights. If they do fly into halls and bedrooms, it is only after you have turned off the lights. Only in dim courtyards can fireflies be found, and the places with the most firefly light are on desolate mountains, in open fields, beside graveyards, among乱草, and in old forests. These places are often like rain from the sky, because these places are shrouded in darkness all night, never having even a little light shone upon them. The light of fireflies is meant to illuminate the darkness. They refuse to fly into places that already have light, doing unnecessary and wasteful work. They provide charcoal in the snow, rather than gilding the lily, even though they only have such a tiny source of light.</p>
<p>I wonder if you have ever had the chance to see a firefly that has just fossilized in the soil cracks at the base of a wall? It is truly rare. At this time, that small bit of firefly light is still shining there, but it is quietly congealed, not flickering, not moving. After ten minutes, the light gradually fades away. Although the firefly's life has ended, the remaining bit of light in its life must continue to exert its utmost until it is exhausted. Even in death, it is still thinking about the darkness of the human world.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Classic of Wood <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Commonly speaking, construction materials mainly consist of bricks, tiles, wood, stone, lime, and nails. Today's steel bars and concrete were unknown in the past. Among those who could skillfully and perfectly utilize the limited materials, Yu Hao in Ouyang Xiu's "Gui Tian Lu" was one such person. The Lingyun Terrace was built during the Three Kingdoms period, and this technique became even more refined during the Song Dynasty, which need not be discussed. "Gui Tian Lu" states, "The Kaibao Temple Pagoda is the tallest among the pagodas in the capital, and its structure is very refined. It was built by the chief artisan Yu Hao. When the pagoda was first completed, it appeared crooked and tilted to the northwest. People were puzzled and asked him about it. Hao said, 'The land in the capital is flat without mountains, and there are many northwest winds. After a hundred years of being blown by the wind, it will straighten itself.' His meticulousness was such. Since the founding of the dynasty, he has been the only such woodworker. To this day, woodworkers all regard Chief Yu as their standard. There is a three-volume 'Classic of Wood' circulating in the world." This record can also prove my observation that tall buildings that sway in the wind are sturdy. However, pagoda construction should mainly use brick and stone as the main materials. Master Yu is not like today's so-called bricklayers, but is known as a woodworker, which I do not understand. It is a pity that I cannot continue his book. Liu Zongyuan wrote about Chief Du Liao building a house, refusing to follow customs, and titled his piece "Biography of the Carpenter." The person is good at measuring materials, "drawing a palace on the wall, one foot in size, intricately making its structure, calculating its smallest details, and constructing large buildings without any errors." The biography mentions the use of axes, adzes, knives, and saws, so the Chief Du Liao is indeed a woodworker.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Remembering Ah Hong <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Ah Hong is six years old, likes to play and doesn't recognize words. Chen's book makes one sleepy, he closes the book and refuses to look at it. He also tires of toys, his mind is only on fruits and snacks. His bag contains a hundred treasures, his little companions look at it. He monopolizes a small stone pen, providing a variety of things for collection, peanuts, chocolates, the categories are each different. His father is often away from home, he often looks forward to his father's arrival, his father is amiable and thoughtful, he remembers only one thing.</p>
<p>His little kisses produce old sayings, often making the old people laugh. Or when he sees a guest come, he rushes to tell them, or when he writes a word successfully, he loves to hear people say it's good. His restlessness has the nature of a dog, he doesn't wear a hat when it's cold. When he comes back from school, the sound he makes upon entering the door is already noisy, as if he is playing a triumphant song, and he opens his mouth asking for reassurance. His little sister is also elegant, often discussing how much there is.</p>
<p>When his mother goes back to Ningbo, Ah Hong sleeps with me, pulling and tugging, chattering about childish things, urging him to work hard and study diligently, he says he has ambition. Every midnight he startles grandfather, his feet powerfully pushing away the blanket, his mouth seems to be saying something, or perhaps he continues with tears; how could it be that in his little dreams there are things that are not as he wishes?</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Churchill's memoirs, describing the beginning of the Second World War, when England and France declared war on Germany, when he was on the roof looking at the air defense equipment, and the arrangement of the bomb shelter in the basement, he immediately imagined the deafening air raids, the collapse of the houses, the smoke and fire, the coming and going of ambulances, the desolate desolation of broken walls and ruins; everything was right before his eyes. In the past, Chinese literary giants had works such as "Lamenting the Ancient Battlefield," which were based on already destroyed relics, and imagined the past. Mr. Qiu "pre-lamented the battlefield." The London Blitz was in July and August of the following year, and the shocking scene had already become an unavoidable fact. The reason for this is that in this war, new weapons (airplanes and bombs) were prepared by the Germans first, and at the beginning, the British air force was inferior in comparison, so the world's first royal city was filled with the terror of ruins.</p>
<p>Scientific weapons are constantly changing and renewing, inadvertently revealing three eras. The First World War was still a plane war mainly based on artillery and tanks. The Second World War was a three-dimensional war with airplanes and bombs and the coordination of the navy and army. The Third World War will be a destructive war with the power of "atoms." And the new weapons of each period must reveal some information in the previous period to hint at the future.</p>
<p>In 1914, the German army broke through Belgium to attack France, relying on 42-centimeter heavy cannons to conquer the Liege fortress, and later galloped eastward and westward. All relied on the products of the Krupp factory. At that time, the classification of aircraft was not precise, and the number was not large, only for reconnaissance and occasional attacks, and they were often shot down. By the later stage of the war, reconnaissance aircraft, fighter aircraft, and bomber aircraft were separated, but the production was not very sound, and the war ended suddenly. However, the dominance of the air force in the Second World War was already determined at this time. Germany devoted itself to unremitting cultivation during the period between the two major wars, and its feathers were full, so at the beginning of the Second World War, iron crows were flying around, sweeping through Poland and the Netherlands into Paris, and sweeping across Europe. In addition to bombing, the airborne transport of gliders was even more miraculous. However, there was a lack of material resources, and the oil supply was even more difficult to sustain. When the United States entered the war, with its abundant production, new and ingenious creations, and agility surpassing Germany, it returned the favor in its own way. The so-called three-axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan all succumbed to the decline in air power. The victory or defeat of this five-year war was determined by the quality of the air force.</p>
<p>Then, as the war was about to end, it suddenly "played the final movement of elegance." In August 1945, two small objects gracefully visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, turning these two major bustling cities into ashes in an instant. Compared with the tragic scene in England in August 1940, it was ten times greater, and the economic efficiency of time was inversely proportional to the bombing of England by the violent Germany. Thus, the elements of the Third World War (atomic weapons) again revealed the coming of spring, just like the small-scale testing of aircraft at the end of the First World War, revealing the news of the large-scale bombing of the Second World War.</p>
<p>Churchill imagined the desolate film of the ruins of England in his mind at the beginning of the Second World War and hesitated infinitely, then what will the light of the atomic war be like? Hiroshima and Nagasaki have already practically directed it twice. The small-scale test is already like this, let alone a large scale? According to Western news, the atomic weapons that have been successfully developed in the past three years are no longer worth mentioning compared to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. The authority of science and the doomsday of the earth have a "happy meeting" momentum.</p>
