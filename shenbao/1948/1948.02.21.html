<h3>馬卿在衆院個會作證　要求國會撥款援華　俾能建立穩定經濟情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿日廣播，華盛頓訊：馬歇爾國務卿廿日出席衆院外交委員會作證，要求國會以五億七千萬美元援助中國，俾使該國有「喘息之時間」，藉以採取步驟，使經濟情形趨於穩定｛但馬卿謂：「美國不能因此而對中國政府之工作及其政治·經濟·軍事事務負担直接責任。關於援華計劃，應認識一點，即中國問題之主耍解決辦法，大部份惟中國人本身是賴」。渠指出妨礙中國經濟問題獲得解決之主要因素，厥爲內戰，復謂：「內戰使中國國內外之外匯存額，陷於枯竭，財產及經濟生活之繼續被破壞，阻撓復興。共軍爲破壞中國經濟，曾造成可怕之損害，良以迫使中國經濟崩潰，乃共產黨之本意」。渠稱：中國之現行情形，使有效之長期經濟復興計劃成爲不可能。惟馬卿又謂：美國應以援助給予中國，藉以協助延遲中國經濟之迅速袞落，俾使中國獲有喘息之時間，從而着手建立更穩定之經濟情形。美國目前不能考慮以建議給予歐州復興計劃之相似援助給予中國。例如以供給貨幣穩定基金言。根據貨幣專家之意見，認爲需要數額甚大，在中國現行情形下，結果大部份將吿消散。渠謂：在對外援助機構未成立前，執行工作將暫由國務院担任。馬卿將對華軍事援助置之不談，預料將引起共和黨之反對。馬卿陳述意見後，該委會主席伊頓當即表示意見，對政府所提援華計劃，作一譬喻，認爲「砲口口徑太大，而子彈太小」。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日合衆電〕領導國會發動援華之衆議員周以德頃稱：政府五億七千萬美元之援華計劃，就軍事方面言，根本欠妥，渠主張以與援希同樣性質之軍事援助給予蔣主席。渠稱：除非中國能在其剿共戰爭中獲得勝利，余不信此種經濟計劃能收何效果，必須剿共勝利，中國因戰爭而造成之經濟枯竭與紊亂始可遏止。周氏不欲就款額方面發表主張，但稱：余自始即曾說明協助中國下列各事乃屬必需者：（一）道義支持，對於此點，總統之援華提案，已予做到。（二）軍事援助，助以軍火，並授權吾人在華之軍事顧問團，使可在各方面多協助中國，一如駐希臘軍事代表團所爲者然。（三）財政協助，使中國可彌補其支付差額，此事祗需每月貸予二千萬美元即可。（四）協助穩定其通貨，最好給予一億五千萬美元至二億美元之白銀。（五）投資於特殊事業，如鐵路·航輪·動力廠。織造廠與肥料廠等，中國之軍事局勢，一旦趨於穩定，私人投資，即可源源流往中國。</p>
<h3>穩定我外匯市場　貝祖詒將向美提出計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕消息靈通方面十九日報告，中國此間經濟技術團長貝祖詒，希望能在今後數日中向美國政府提出中國所擬就以美援平穩滬外匯市塲之計劃。該方面稱：能採取此種處理問題之特殊方式，南京方面已宣稱將向美國要求三億至五億元，以獲到某種之穩定。貝氏行將提出之計劃，要求美國以最高爲五億元之數額資助上海之中國政府外匯平穩員會，該會將控制一切外匯交易，傳中國之理由爲外匯委員會如有此款項，則力能經常維持外匯率，財政專家以爲，中國政府如能經常維持外匯率，則其必需計劃之效率將大見增强。若干專家相信，五億元基金中，一部份可能用於增加五億七千萬美國援華計劃所規定之物品之購買，據指出，援華計劃中劃出五億一千萬元作爲「必需品之進口」之用，此數恰符中國在援華計劃有效期中之最近數字。僉信，此一用途上，如更能多籌的款，則益可减輕若干缺乏，其理由爲平衡外匯使政府有較大之管制進口效能，同時，佐以超過計劃之必需品之進口，可能確立穩定中國國內物品局勢之基礎，一般相信，此乃革新幣制之先決條件。貝祖飴在過去數週中，將張羣之十點財政經濟改良計畫之內容，逐點向美國官員「　發」，至今日為止，貝氏已詳盡解釋其中之七點，然第五點則獨付闕如，按該點有關「確立穩同幣制之基礎」。貝氏所擬在短期內提出者，厥爲第五點之「闡明」，預計其內容將包括穩定外匯市塲之計劃，恐亦爲附有其他間接解決通貨問題之方策。中國官員明確表示，目前對以銀本位改革幣制一事不感興趣。</p>
<h3>本年度貸款計劃　四聯理事會今討論決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕四聯理事會廿日上午九時舉行本年度首次會議，由理事會副主席張羣主持，各理事及四行兩局一庫負責人均將參加，本年度之貸款計劃即可於會中討諭決定，惟需俟蔣主席最後核定後，始可實施。農貸將首先開放，已成定局，但開放之日期現未定，因貸款之停止，係蔣主席之手諭，故開放之日期，亦將俟主席決定。四聯總處所擬定之貸款計劃中，仍分農貸與工鑛貸款兩部分，各擬有本年度之方針及計劃，惟工鑛貸款並未預先擬定數額，至四行兩局一庫對本年度貸款之計劃，截至廿日，已全部送達四聯總處，經部對開放貸款，前曾呈請政院，提出三點意見，主張貸款應於春節前開放，未蒙採納，此次四聯理事會開會，經長陳啓天特令工業司擬具工業貸款之意見，由該司司長顧葆常負責草擬，已於十九日晚草擬完成，面呈陳氏，此項意見亦將於廿一日四聯理事會中提出，聞其大要即主張工貸應早日恢復，以促進生產，關於貸款方式，主張應視各業之不同而有別，不必固定某一方式，且工貸辦理之區域，尤應全國一視同仁，不應偏於某一地區，並主張應有通盤計劃。</p>

<h3>吳鐵城談話對美援華表示興奮</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕吳鐵城秘書長廿日就美總統之援華建議對記者發表談話稱。杜魯門總統之建議援華，實爲令人興奮之消息，吳氏並强調我中國人之所深感佩慰者，非僅美總統之援華之建議及援助數目之多寡，乃係其深切瞭解我中國人民當前所遭遇之困難。吳氏繼稱：吾人需要外援以恢復我國大戰後之傷痕及目前共黨之一切破壞，一如歐洲諸國今日需要外援之迫切，是以吾人希望杜魯門總統之援華法案早日能通過美國國會。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽廿日電〕廿日大雪，空軍活動受阻。據軍事機關表示，鞍山守軍十九日曾堅守鐵西鋼鐵廠，斃匪頗多，入夜與此間失卻聯絡。攻鞍山之匪衆達五六萬，守軍以少於匪若干倍兵力堅守一週，英勇壯烈。鞍山北沙河鐵橋　及另一二據點，在國軍固守中。又，竄集瀋北開原地區匪衆，聞係妄岡截襲調動中之國軍，被國軍擊退。</p>

<h3>關於配糧的幾個問題</h3>
<p>中美救濟協定，於去年十月廿七日是。由兩國政府簽訂公佈時，本報曾經為文，主張在本市實施全面配給，即以其中糧食一項，撥充配給物資；而另由我國担承半數，以資配合。現在中央決定，在京，滬，平，津，穗五大市，同時舉辦配給，原則上，與我們的主張，可稱完全一致。糧食部召集的糧食配傷會議，也已於日前在京舉行，對於一切配給計劃，均已有所決定，所通過的五市糧食配售實施通則，也將開始實行。這是非常重要的一件事。我們願再就辦法上　　　干問題，以供主管機關的參考。</p>
<p>（一）如何準備問題　此次　　　，中央主管部會及五大市，事前均有相當的計劃。本市基礎較厚，關於配給的大綱，和實施的細則，均曾經分別擬妥之後，再提供中央討論。我們相信：此次糧配會議討論的結果，一定是相當完善的。不過全面配給，在我國究屬初次，技術上又十分繁複，爲求時間，數量與價格的準確起見，凡來源，運輸，堆存，分配，調査，給證，代售各項問題，都不能不作縝密的佈置和聯繫。所以事先的準備務求充分，機構，經費和人手的配備，尤須完整；不可以時間的偬促而過於草率，亦不可專爲省錢的緣故而過於簡略。過去行政上那種急就成章，和因陋就簡的作風，在配給上俱不相宜。因爲這是一樁科學化的工作，與每個市民，俱有利害關係的，尤其是國際觀瞻所係的。我們行政上的效率到底如何？為此便要作一事實上的答　。　　　　　　心呢？</p>
<p>（二）如何合作問題辦法雖很周密，而奉行不得力，或民衆不守法，終究無濟於事的。由於過去各種事實上所昭示，我們希望：（一）調査務要準確，與審核務求嚴正，一切重複，遷就，虛冒等弊病，務期一掃面空；（二）因此戶口的移動，與國民身份證的具領，在市民方面，亦需要盡最大的注意。現在戶口雖已査過，而戶籍却未必十分淸楚，尤其是身分證一項；未必人人具備，這當然不能完全歸咎於自治機構，因爲市民對於此類手續，未免太忽略了。</p>
<p>（三）流弊如何防止問題所謂流弊，除上文所說的重複虛冒以外，聞見所及，還有下面這幾種；（一）領不到配給票；（二）領票時或須附帶履行某種條件；（三）領到了票，往往買不到貨；（四）貨品太壞；（五）分量不足；（六）在某某區域內，聞有把配給量，另行支配等情事，與政府所定各人的配量，已根本不符了；（七）把配給品仍照市價賣出去，而將所得的利益：（差價）留充公用，事前却並沒有呈奉當局許可；（八）經手機關，或竟會有一部分餘剩的配給證，可以按月分派，好像分紅一般。這些弊病，當然不是普徧性的，但也並不是絕無其事的。此次本市所擬的實施細則第十七至二十等條，對於以上一至五等項，已有明文禁止，而六七八等項應行如何防止，尙未經觸及，亟應設法補充，切實査禁，以提高配政的信譽，並以增加市民的信任。</p>
<p>（四）價與量如何規定問題配給有三個條件，即定期，定量與定價，非此，不足以達到糧定市價與安定社會的目的。關於價的方面，到底如何決定，截至執筆時止，還沒有得到消息。據都方預示：擬較市價低百分之五，這與一般的期望似不相符。因爲過去本市配價，每担尙祗二十四萬元，本月份起　將調整，每担亦不過八十萬元。如照部定價格配售，相差未免太遠。而且按月調整，無異追隨黑市，這與抑平米價的宗旨，亦覺格格不入。糧食部兪部長曾以堅定之語氣稱：相信糧價在配售制度實施後，決可平抑至相當程度。（見十六日本報）我們以爲這較市價低百分之五的配但，還不是）般人民所歡迎的。</p>
<p>至於量的方面，預定小口按月一斗，完全配給，大口兩斗，一半照配，稱爲配售米，一半自購，稱爲准購米。這在糧源未暢，尙未能完全把握住這項物資以前，確是不得已的辦法。而且照此辦理，米商依舊可以營業，不致釀成失業等嚴重問題，亦可稱雙方兼顧。所可研究的是，每人的准購米，亦須憑證購買，而且不許超過限額，雖說防止囤積或不得不如此做法。但在民衆食米，政府還未能充分供應，又配給時期，目前亦祗暫定四月，還未能確實延長下去以前，這項限制，究竟是否必要，似乎是個問題。因爲散戶購存自用食米，到底與大量囤積不同，而且准購米較爲充裕，亦未嘗不可稍减政府之負担。例如規模較大的公司行廠，對於員工的食米，往往自有積儲，所以配米是否敷用，有無延期，都不發生困難。我們的看法，如果政府必須厲行這項限制的話，那麽，配給期間的延長，與配給物量的擴充，（就是說：大口每月的兩疛米，必須完全配給。）是必須繼續努力，從速促其實現的。古人說得好，「有其舉之，莫或廢之」，旣經辦了起來，我們總希望繼續辦理下去，萬不可忽作忽輟，致失政府的威望。我們尤希望設法擴充，眞正辦得辦個樣子，使市民對於食糧和其他日用品的供給，的確可以信賴，無須另行積貯，那麼，散戶囤積之風自戰，而物價也可以滿　於穩定了。</p>
<p>現在配給的時期，據傳暫定爲四個月，即假定自本年三月起至六月底止，其理由，當然以美國救濟品項下的糧食爲數有限，不容許長期配給的緣故。不過據我們所知，以後的補充，朱始沒有途徑。例如：（一）美國物資配售所得的代價，依照中美協定第三條丙款，是仍可以周而復始用來購買糧食的。（二）去年美國國會臨時會議所通過的對華貸款，計美金一千八百萬元，據傳亦將出以物資援助的形式，這還都是從外援方面打算的。假如配給價格，確定爲較市價低百分之五，那麽，所失無幾，是項辦米的墊款，尤其不難設法。</p>
<p>總之，這次糧配會議，其要點雖重在糧食一項，而其影響却徧及到整個的配給問題。因爲糧食是配給的中心，，糧食配得好，其餘油，鹽，糖，布，燃料等項日用品，也就連帶地辦好了。所以此項會議，關係極大。除了上列各項問題之外，我們並希望牠放寬範圍，把經濟部資源會等機關，也統通派員參加，以便其他各項日用品的配給，也有設法改進的機會。昨日本報社論「美援與自助」一文，內有「杜魯門總統主張在八年之內撥款五億七千萬美元援助中國」一句，「八年」係「一年」之誤，特此勘誤。</p>

<h3>日皇是否負戰罪責任　我野均極注意　外部方面對此未加評論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕東京遠東國際軍事法庭檢察處，提出對日本戰犯總控訴書宣稱：日本天皇並不負戰罪責任之消息傳抵首都後，朝野人士均極注意，外交部方面稱：尙未獲得我駐日官員正式報吿，拒加評論，蒙藏會委員長許世英，戰前爲我駐日大使，氏對本報記者分析此問題之眞象背景後，暫時保留其個人之意見，唯強調在任何情况下，爲確切保證日本不再事侵略，監督必須從嚴。法學家府委王寵惠亦認：和約簽訂後之管制工作，不可忽視，然對日本天皇之是否負戰罪責任及其存廢問題，以爲並不十分重要，保留天皇，可使日本政治社會不致紊亂，並可使之負責和約條款之履行，至防制日本再起從事侵略，可自澈底解除其軍備武裝，重新教育其人民思想，建立民主根基着手。外交家王正遷則認：遠東國際法庭檢察處此項決定之內因，係政治影響司法王氏舉庚子八國聯軍一役後慈　太后未負戰罪責任之例謂，如此可免由日人迷信感情引起混亂，然果究之法律，當作別論。其不容宣布姓名之司法學者謂，全部日本侵略歷程中，日皇均曾親身參與決策，並出而領導，東京國際法庭之措施，殊欠考慮。又某知名國際法學家亦稱：日皇絕不似英皇之爲「虛君」，雖戰時火權落於軍部之手，然天皇至少仍保留三分一之決定權力，此於日本無條件投降一事觀之，或尙不止此，故如謂天皇無戰罪責任，實開脫過甚，至於天皇之存廢問題，亦大可研究，天皇爲超憲法者，戰前日法學家美濃部達吉“因主張天皇爲憲法以內者而獲　下獄，其在日本傳統心理中之　質，槪可想見，如何以嚴格之　督與再敎育，使附着於天皇迷　之侵略思想與體系全部蕩除，乃最重要之事。</p>

<h3>強力支持聯合國機構　美政策保持不渝　杜魯門馬歇爾明白表示</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十日電〕杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿頃向國會提出關於聯合國機構之聯合報吿。杜魯門表示不論如何令人失望，聯合國機構仍在進展之中。馬歇爾亦謂，聯合國機構內雖有少數會員國之執拗態度，然整個機構仍獲有堅決的進展。杜魯門總統並表示，美國將織被如過去之以聯合國會員國之地位，充份分担責任及領導，希望因此能鼓勵每一會員國，以同一精神協助聯合國機構完成其宗旨，使其原則對於聯合國所而臨的問題，產生實際上的效果。美國對聯合國機構之信任，永矢勿衰。美國當以强力支持及參加聯合國之精神，表現其信任。加强聯合國機構繼續爲美國外交政策之礎石。最近聯合國機構之過程，不無令人失望之處，尤以關於國際原子能管制之設立及直接成間接有關國際安全之各種政治經濟問題爲甚。然整個而論，聯合國機構仍在進展之中。馬歇爾之報吿，除述及前述諸點失望外，並對國際安全軍問題之不獲協議，及希臘等若干特種安全問題之因少數國之阻撓，不獲使和平確立，表示遺憾。渠並預料今後不免繼續產生歧見，果爾當不足引以爲異。</p>
<h3>對巴勒斯坦問題　我維持原來立場　劉鍇參加起草耶城法令</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖十九日電〕我國代表劉鍇今向聯合國託管理事會聲明其參加起草耶路撒冷法令之舉，將毫不妨礙中國政府，於來日中對於整個巴勒斯坦問題所採取之任何立場。劉鍇大使追述中國代表團在聯大討論巴勒斯坦問題時，曾堅持任何得以美滿實行之辦法，必須以直接有關方面之同意爲基礎。劉氏繼稱，中國對於大會表決巴勒斯坦問題時，曾放棄投票，目前中國政府對於巴勒斯坦問題之立塲，仍未改變，劉氏解釋託管理事會主要之工作草擬耶路撒冷法令之專門工作，其與範圍廣泛之巴勒斯坦問題之政治方面，或其他關係無涉『</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十九日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦委員會建議組織國際軍隊，中國表示不願贊助，致此案又受一打擊。安理會於今日表決時，五大國中至少將有兩國棄權，且可能增至三國，英國殖民部長瓊斯，十八日已在記者招待會中表示，英國將遵守去秋聯大辯論分治案時所採取之棄權政策。法國代表雖未表示，但亦有棄權可能。惟美國尙未發表立塲，蘇聯亦仍保持秘密。一般意見，認爲此項建議，縱使能得美蘇兩國支持，亦不易在十一票中獲得法定之七票多數。敍利亞曾在聯大反對分治，尙有阿根廷與哥倫比亞兩國棄權。中國立塲已由劉外次於託管理事會中說明。　〔聯合社開羅十九日電〕阿拉伯同盟某人士今日稱：阿拉伯同盟政治委員會已決定對美國及支援巴勒斯坦分治其他各國採用經濟抵制，但在聯合國決定派遣國際軍開往巴勒斯坦前，此種抵制不擬實施。印巴均願支持越南</p>
<h3>聯合國正注視　越南局勢發展　印巴均願支付越南</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十九日電〕印度與巴基斯坦代表團今日均稱，越南共和國與法國之爭執徜在聯合國機構攤牌，印度與巴基斯坦均將支持越南。但該國自身多事不願採取主動。該兩國此種意見係因阿刺伯同盟聲明支援越南獨立而起。越南去秋欲使印度向聯合國機構提出此案未遂。觀察家預料越南局勢急轉直下，引起聯合國之注意。法國正謀使安南遜王保大復辟。</p>
<h3>糧農機構會議　後日在菲開幕</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十九日電〕葉門王之子阿爾伊斯蘭，今日下午由倫敦乘火車抵此，據傳渠所以突然離倫敦，乃因國王遇刺之故。</p>
<h3>梅農出席小型大會　報告朝鮮局勢　會議定下星期二再開</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十九日電〕聯合國小型大會今日開會討論朝鮮問題，駐鮮代表團主席印度代表梅農報吿協助朝鮮統一工作失敗情形。謂戰爭結束以來，朝鮮遭受生硬處置，刺鮮與論一致認聯合國爲其最後希望，此種希望倘亦摧毁，則朝鮮或將爆發事變，成爲亞洲及全世界浩刦之導火綫。</p>
<p>梅農向四十八國代表報告歷一小時二十分鐘，蘇聯集團各國仍未參加會議，哥斯達利加·尼加拉瓜與巴拉圭亦缺席。梅農並稱，本代表團不願承認無力實施聯合國大會之決議，本團一致以爲促成朝鮮統一政府一綫希望尙存，必須繼續努力爲之，聯合國不能置朝鮮於不顧。小型大會旋以卅七對一票決定休會至廿四日晨，以便各代表硏究梅農之報吿。加拿大與黎巴嫩代表主迅速行動，美國代表吉蘇浦則贊成延會，但當塲表示美國認爲本問題迫切，駐鮮代表團必須繼續工作，毫無疑義。梅農並稱，對日軍事佔領順遂，對鮮軍事佔領則處處遇阻，對美軍司令霍奇之責　到處可聞。余個人以爲此乃健全的民主徵象，勝於日本人對麥帥之賈目崇拜。某方估計北鮮兵力多至八十萬人，霍奇則謂不過二十萬名，情形如此，美國在相當時期內　無法自朝鮮撤兵。最近某通訊社自漢城發出電報，似已引起一誤會。電中提及北鮮設立傀儡政府，變動聽聞。當余到達紐約機塲時，即問蘇聯在朝鮮設立政府，準備接管南鮮之傳說。就吾人所能確定者，北鮮政權之特質，最近並無變更，該政府設立於赴鮮代表團組織以前，目的當然不在妨碍本代表團。同時本團在美軍佔領區內接到關於限制或剝奪公民權利之大批證據，此事引起選舉能否自由進行之問題，此種情形須加糾正。好在軍事當局與南鮮臨時政府已表示準備極力擔保自由選舉，事實上已就此方面頒佈初步命令。</p>
<h3>四強討論奧和約　奧有接受蘇聯要求傾向</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿日電〕討論奧國條約之四强代表會議，今日在此舉行。據悉，美代表團認爲蘇聯對奧境德產之耍求尙嫌過份，惟奧國亟欲和約成立，俾外國駐軍早日撤退，故願意接受蘇方要求，俾結束佔領狀態。按蘇聯所要求者，幾等於奧國油產三分之二，五十年內奧東部採油權三分之二，及年產四十五萬噸之煉油設備。蘇聯並要求取得多瑙河航業公司在匈保羅之全部資產，在奧境百分之五十五之資產，最後並要求奧國於兩年內賠償蘇聯現金一億美元。</p>
<h3>杜魯門競選演說　宣布防止經濟恐慌計劃</h3>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統十九日晚出席民主黨傑弗遜·傑克遜紀念日宴會時，即席發表演說，譴責共和黨控制下之國會，對美國今日面臨之問題之「眞相」缺乏注意力。並稱：渠「不能相信這一批反動份子」。杜魯門指現國會「不明瞭亦不願明瞭一切眞相，故民主黨應負責使美國能採取正確之方向」。渠稱，希望能公佈「反動」活動之「全部事實」。</p>
<h3>北韓組織政府　尚未成為事實</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕接近國務部之負責人士今日稱：漢城傳出蘇聯在北　設立傀儡政府之消息，係對平壤電台廣播之誤解。平壤電台僅稱北鮮政府之設立及其憲法正在考慮中，但尙未實現。漢城美國某軍官神經過敏，誤認爲已成事實，貿然加以引證。英否認提交聯合國</p>
<h3>南極領土爭執　英美進行商談　英否認提交聯合國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕英外部否認英政府擬將福克蘭羣島問題，提交聯合國解決。並謂，倫敦與華盛頓間現正在討論該問題，此爲海牙國際法庭職權內之事。</p>

<h3>保國反共領袖稱　美蘇戰爭難避免</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕保加利亞農民黨領袖狄米特洛夫現流亡在美，十九日出席衆院反美活動調査委員會作證稱，「美國乃世界共產主義之「第一號靶子」，美國之叛徒正　蘇　之訓，一旦共產黨得勢，彼等將歸國統治美人。狄氏稱，美蘇　爭似不可避免，然蘇聯目前不希望戰爭，蓋彼等尙未準備就緒。</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕何人繼任日本之下屆首相問題，現成爲日本政界以及一般國民之中心話題。民主黨十九日已決議舉黨一致推戴蘆田總裁，自由黨則堅持吉田，保守之小會派似亦有與其合流之趨勢，其間僅社會黨之態度，尙未決定，雖右派希望支持蘆田，然左派則堅不同意，因之右派深恐黨內分裂致缺芝擁護蘆田任首相到底之決心。從此亦有認爲在廿一日之提名投票選舉時，未必不再提出片山者。一般認爲廿一日國會之提名，國協黨之態度可能影響首相人選，若國協黨支特蘆田，則投票之結果，爲蘆田·吉田·片山之順序，但皆不能超過半數，然蘆田當選之可能性殊大，反之若國協黨支持吉田，則吉田當選希望極大。又若支持片山，則當選之順次爲片山·吉田·蘆田，面此時片山。吉田何人獲勝，則依然民主黨之態度決定之。此間關於日本下屆首相問題，目前最屬注意者，厥爲民主黨對社會黨之政策協定，以及國協黨之動向兩問題。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京日日電〕日參嚴院亦正式決定於廿一日下午一時，實行下屆首相之提名投票，在人數上占最多數之綠風會實可掌握決定權，故其動向極堪重視。迄今爲止，其大多數似皆支持自由黨總裁吉田，其次社會黨員四十餘名之動向，亦堪注目，在參議院中雖預料吉田可以當選，惟其差額極少，故仍難確定。</p>
<h3>民主黨再行草擬　四黨政策協定案</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕民主黨自將政策協定案分別送交社會自由國協三黨後，除自由黨已正式拒絕外，社會黨亦嫌內容空洞而要求補充具體意見，故該黨於昨日曾再草就四黨政策協定具體案而提交社會·國協兩黨，其內容由以下五項目組成之，即：（一）綜合之生產增强對策；（二）通貨膨脹防止對策；（三）重要產業之國家管理；（四）爭議之和平解決等勞資協調方策；（五）中央地方之稅制整理案。即可交陸軍部核辦</p>
<h3>美對日棉貸計劃　麥帥修訂中　即可交陸軍部核辦</h3>
<p>〔聯介社東京二十日電〕美國銀團擬放款六千萬美元由日本購買美棉計劃，麥帥略加修改，即可交還美國陸軍部核辦。</p>
<h3>畑俊六與荒木等　　國際法庭提控訴</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿日電〕今日國際法庭檢察處起訴書中，指控畑俊六有意促使東條英機當權，以使日本迅速步入與英義作戰之途徑，由於東條出任陸相，整個內閣復遂被置於陸軍控制之下。起訴書繼指貴烟俊六曾以在華派遣軍司令官之身份率領日軍進入中國心臟地帶，企圖將中國政府變成一地方政權，最後完全予以摧毀。一九三九年渠任陸相時，曾全力支特並贊助在中國進行大規模侵略戰爭，自一九四一年三月至一九四四年十一月期間，日軍在華所犯罪行，渠亦應負責。因渠所統率之在華日軍，曾從事燒殺姦淫虜掠各種罪行。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京二十日電〕據國際軍事法庭檢察處對前任日陸相與文相戰犯荒木貞夫個人之控訴書稱：荒木於一九三三年曾稱反對日本向中國東北擴張及日本帝國政策者「應以槍彈與刺刀對付之」。檢察官宣讀荒木之控訴書稱：荒木在位時，其所遵行者，即係此種武裝侵略政策，渠經常公開或暗中擬訂侵略計劃，並敎日本人民擴大軍事侵略。荒木任陸相時，同意將「滿洲國交與關東軍控制，渠已承認曾自行擬訂侵佔熱河，曁其他華北三省之計劃。荒木又供認日本內閣於一九三一年決議佔領東北四省，亦係渠听計劃之結果。荒木就任文相後，日本爲辯護其侵略行動而發動之宣傳，亦大爲加强，於某項電影片中，尙可見荒木大聲疾呼，訓誡日本人民遵行其軍事領袖之計劃，以征服世界，渠並以「共榮圈」口號作號召，其神態有似納粹之宣傳部長戈培爾。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿日電〕日戰犯平沼與廣田前任首相，今日被提至遠東國際法庭聽聆檢察官對彼等之公訴書。廣田爲日本極端國家主義份子所組成之黑龍會首領之門徒，其主要罪狀爲向中國實行日本侵略政策；老邁龍鍾之平沼曾任樞密院長多年，對日本政界頗多影響，其罪狀則爲贊助近衛之對華政策，於一九三九年六月十日會見在逆精衛允許支持僞政府，並曾於同年五月四日向希特勒表示必要時日本可在軍事上援助德國。下週一爲紀念華盛頓誕辰，國際法庭將停審一天</p>
<h3>解除日武裝　潘友新重申立場</h3>
<p>謂蘇在遠委會態度公正</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十九日電〕蘇聯駐美大使潘友新，今日以書面聲明一件交與美國報界，內稱：美國各報發表「徧狹而含有脅迫性」之文字，謂蘇聯在遠東委員會中爲一「阻撓份子」，蘇聯特爲此事提出嚴重之抗議。蘇聯在遠東委員會中歷次之發言，無懈可擊，其目的不過欲澄淸若千要點而已，委員會之大部份人士亦均贊同蘇聯之意見，蘇聯對於擴大委員會組織，採取必要步驟，俾保證日本澈底實行廢軍一項提案，曾保留意見，未予投票通過，則因蘇聯之補充案曾遭駁斥之故，然因蘇聯運用否決權，即稱之爲「阻撓份子」，此實荒謬可笑之至。關於巴基斯坦申請參加遠東委員會一節，外傳蘇聯曾表示拒絕其參加，此亦屬誤解，蘇聯僅主張於下次集會時討論此項問題，俾與會各代表可向其政府請示耳。又稱，蘇聯對於日本廢軍議案之補充，有下述主要二點：（一）限制日本軍警僅可使用「小型武器」，藉以維持治安，（二）保證所有査獲之日本軍事設備至遲須於六月內消滅凈盡。其結語稱：美國報紙歪曲報導，謂蘇聯在遠東委員會中爲一「阻撓份子」云云，此僅足引起輿論界之恐怖。</p>
<h3>美國天空隕星爆炸</h3>
<p>〔中央社堪薩斯加諾爾教十九日合衆電〕當局宣稱：昨夜堪薩斯州上空發生之可怕爆炸聲，乃一隕星落入地球大氣圈時，與空氣磨擦因而炸裂所致。紐約某科學家稱，據報吿顯示隕星之體積必極龐大，如落在居民區，則損失必大。隕星爆炸時，其强烈震動，使堪薩斯·尼勃拉斯加·奧克拉霍瑪諸州之居民皆爲之驚慌失措。玻窗破碎，房屋搖搖欲墜。爆炸前，隕星曾發出一股靑白之濃烟，横昇半空。隕星似已完全破裂地上，雖多方搜尋，仍未發現其破片。佔全國收入第二位</p>
<h3>狄安娜竇萍</h3>
<p>佔全國收入第二位</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕財政部宣布一九四四年至一九四六年十季間美國賺錢最多三男子爲影業巨頭梅逸爾，賺錢最多之女子則爲影星狄安娜竇萍，梅逸爾在過去九年中，保持個人收入最高紀錄，達八年之久。至一九四五年八月爲止之一年內，渠自洛夫影片公司之收入達五〇二·五七一元。居第二位者爲產片家溫格爾，計收入二八二·九〇〇元。狄安娜寳萍全年收入爲二六二·八七五元。前項收入僅係自特種公司之收入，並非個人之總收入根據證券及物品交易所之記錄，梅逸爾一九四六年之收入達八九八·五七一元，而財政部宣布，狄安娜竇萍一九四六年之總收入爲三一〇·七二八元，居全國個人收入之第二位，女子個人收入之第一位。</p>
<h3>印度國大黨　擬具新黨規</h3>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄　（二十七）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>一言不發，向後轉，開步走</p>
<p>十一月二十六日我交給野村與來梄大使的建議，（即十大要點之和平解決方案），是一種維特我們談判　繼續進行的誠摯努力，在這上面我們寄以不絕如　的希望，那就是：即使在這最後的一分鐘，希望有些微的常識能够滲入東軍人的腦海中。</p>
<p>不久，日方的宣傳——尤其是在日本開始遭遇過嚴重敗績之後——企圖曲解我們十一月二十六日的備忘錄，稱它做「哀的美敦書」，這正是日方的著名特質，利用完全處構的藉口，迷惑他們的人民，並爲軍事刦掠獲得他們的支持。</p>
<p>野村與來栖大使本身也承認與我們破裂的責任是在日本身上。同日，十一月二十六日，他們有電報拍給東京，爲我們的陸軍與海軍裁獲，這電報建議把責任移到我們身上。他們說：假使在這種談判中，我們故意開始我們預定的行動，那末，談判中斷的責任就有移到我們身上的危險。以前曾有好幾次，她（美國）可以因爲我們侵入越南而攷慮中止談判。現在假使在沒有闡明我們的意志之前，中斷我們的談判，並突然開始單獨行動，那就恐怕她會利用此點，作爲針對我們的反宣傳。</p>
<p>從外相東鄕給野村和來栖的十一月二十八日電文中，就可以看出將要發生的是什麽。這電文說與我們的談判，即將中斷，但又稱：「我不願意你們造成一種印象，使人以爲談判業已中斷。你可僅僅吿訴他們說：你正在等候訓令，並且聲明：你們的政府的意見，雖然你還不得而知，但是照你們的想法，帝國政府所提出的要求，一向都是很公正的，而且爲了維護太平洋的和平，已經蒙受了很大的犧牲。」</p>
<p>換一句話講，來栖任務的第二階段巳經到臨了。第一個階段是要迫使我們接受日本在東方的覇權。這個失敗之後，第一一個任務就是要在白方武力進攻未準備完成以前，用談話使我們迷亂。</p>
<p>十一月二十九日，我看到了東條與東鄕預備於十一月三十日在大日本東亞同盟風大政翼贊會聯合主辦的大會中所發表的演詞節要。東條電報中有一段說：「蔣介石與英美及共產主義沆瀣一氣，爲了對日本作無效的抵抗，不惜犧牲壯丁與有爲的靑年。這種事實，祗是爲了英美要在東亞的混水中摸魚，使東亞民族互相對壘，以便他們奪取東亞的覇權……，爲了人類的光榮與自尊，我們必須把這種行爲逐出東亞。「　我在攷慮之後，曾與我們軍事當局及遠東專家加以討論，並反覆研究以前我們所接到關於日方在越南新行動的各種報吿；當夜（十一月二十九日）我打電話給總統，强調日本進攻的危機，並勸他提早返回華盛頓，總統表示同意。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統於十二月一日星期一早上到達華盛頓。在他未到之前，野村與來栖到國務院來訪我，問我總統爲何提早返至首都。日本使節顯然是恐怕總統趕返華盛頓將與他們用談判迷亂我們的訓令相衝突。我說原因之一，就是日本首相的大言。</p>
<p>十二月五日，我以訓令用無綫電拍給我們駐於東京及遠東其他各點的外交代表，囑咐他們毁滅電碼，密庫，護照等，並關閉辦公室，將當地職員解僱，而在必要緊急時，與國務院斷絕通訊。</p>
<p>在第二天，十二月六日，我們似乎覺得，威脅已久的日本武力南進已在進行了。</p>
<p>總統認謂：他致電日本天皇的時候，已經到臨了。他把電文草案送給我，內容與我前一星期送給他的草電大致相同。我與我的同事閱讀一過，認爲其中若干詞句，爲了技術準確問題，應予修改。我們修正之後，把草電送回到白宮，同晚，羅斯福先生又把它送給我，內容並無更動，並附函稱：「親愛的柯德爾：把這電報趕快拍給格魯，我以爲可用「灰色電碼」。（按灰色電碼乃美國國務院最不秘密的電碼）這可以節省時間，我並不怕電報爲人截獲—羅斯福。」</p>
<p>星期日早上，一九四一年十二月七日，我照例到辦公室。自從一九三五年我進入國務院之後，我幾乎每一個星期日都辦公。</p>
<p>在這天早上，我接到一連串截獲的電報，包括計有十四節的由東鄕外相致野村與來栖的長電。這是對我們十一月二十六日建議的答復，在長電之外，附有短電，訓今日大使把原電呈交我國政府。如屬可能，時間應在當日下午一時。這已是最後關頭了。</p>
<p>日方的照會，比侮辱還惡劣一些。電報說我們的建議，「藐視日本在四年中國事件中的犧牲，威脅帝國本身的生存，並損及它的光榮與尊嚴。」該電又說我們與英國及其他各國同謀，阻碍日方在建立東亞新秩序及和平方面的努力。該電的結論稱：「鑒於美國政府的態度，日本政府不得不認爲已無法經由進一步的談判獲致協議。」</p>
<p>此一照會並沒有宣戰，也沒有斷絕外交關係。日本是不需要這些預先步驟來開始進攻的。</p>
<p>將近中午的時候，野村大使打電話給我，請求我在下午一時與他及來栖會晤。我接受了他的請求。</p>
<p>一點過了數分鐘之後，野村又打電話給我，請求將約會延至下午一點四十五分，我表示同意。</p>
<p>日本使節在兩點零五分到達國務院，直入外交等候室，大約正在這時候，總統從白宮打電話給我，他的聲音非常鎮定，但是也有些急促。</p>
<p>他說：「有一報吿說，日本已進攻珍珠港。」我問：「電報巳經證實了沒有？」他說：「沒有。」</p>
<p>我們都以爲這一報吿，或許是眞的，但是我建議他應該設法證實，其時我想到我與日本使節的約會。</p>
<p>與我同在辦公室的計有法律顧問赫克華斯及巴倫丹。在我與日方談判時，巴倫丹多數都在塲。我向他們說：</p>
<p>「總統已接獲未經證實的報吿，說是日本已進攻珍珠港。日本使節等着要看我，我知道他們要的是什麼。他們將拒絕我們十一月二十六日的照會，也許他們會吿訴我們，聲明業已宜戰。我頗有不願接見他的意思。」</p>
<p>但是經過考慮之後，我就決定接見他們，因爲總統所接獲的報吿，尙未經證實，也許在百份之一中，這一報吿是不確實的。我與赫克華斯及巴倫丹約略討論我將要對日本使節講的話。當我傳令接見日使節時，赫克華斯離去，而巴倫丹則留在室內。</p>
<p>野村與來栖於囤兩點二十分時進入我的辦公室。我冷淡的招待他們，並未請他們坐下。</p>
<p>野村用過於謙遜的態度說：他的政府訓令他在下午一時以照會一件呈交我們，但是因爲譯電困難，所以遲到。然後他就將其政府的照會交給我。</p>
<p>我問他爲什麽他在第一次請求我接見的時候，要指定下午一時。他說他並不知道，但說這是他所接到的訓令。</p>
<p>我假做閱讀照會，我早知其內容，但是當然不能表示這一事實。</p>
<p>我讀兩三節之後，我問野村：他是否是在其政府訓令下，呈遞這一文件。他說是的。　當我略閱之後，我面向野村，並以目光注視他。</p>
<p>我說：「我必須聲明，在過去九個月，我與你的談判中，我從未說過一句不忠實的話。這點絕對可由事實予以證明。在我服務政府五十年中，我從未見過包括這許多無恥虛僞與曲解的文件——其無恥虛僞與曲解的程度，是如此的巨大，直至今日爲止，我從未想到目前世界中任何政府能够講得出來。</p>
<p>野村好像是沒有講什麽。他的神色泰然自若，但我覺得他已處在很大的感情緊張之下，我用手勢解救了他。我向房門點了點頭，日本使節一言不發，就向後轉，開步走，頭往下埀。</p>
<p>用豐富的田納西山嶺語言來說，我已把日本使節「駡走」，但事實上我已把我上面說的吿訴了他們。「駡走」的程度，沒有再比這次更激烈的了。</p>
<p>巴倫丹把我說的話，紀錄下來。在日本使節走出之後，我立即喚我的速記員進來，用記憶讀出我對他們所講的話。這與我向報界發表的相同。　野村與我的最後一次會晤，與他歷次處理討論的方法，是一樣的拙劣。他的政府訓令他約定下午一時與我會晤，目的是在日方進攻珍珠港數分鐘前，將照會交給我。野村的使館胡說是因譯電遲慢之故。但是野村旣然知悉限期的重要性，即使他祗拿到照會的最初數行，也應該訓令大使館接着把隨後譯好的送到國務院，而本人則準於下午一時來看我。　因此，日本是未經提出警吿而進攻珍珠港，大槪發生在野村與來栖提出照會的一小時有多之前。</p>
<p>在日本使節離去不久，我就在電話中與總統講話，將我吿訴日本使節的話，向他重述一遍。他對我講得這樣激烈，表示滿意，但在那時候，他已接獲關於日本進攻珍珠港的報吿了。</p>
<p>下午三點多，我到白宮去，與總統及其他人物談了四十分鐘。羅斯福先生在態度與談話中，都很嚴肅。日方在出其不意進攻珍珠港上所收獲的巨大，已經很爲明顯。但見不論是他或是我們，都沒有一時一刻對美國應付危機的能力，失去信心。</p>

<h3>房租標準草案通過　每三個月調整一次　按前三月房屋指數平均計算　俟送參議會議決後施行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來生活指數不斷上漲，房屋業主收入不數開支，地政局爲處理房租糾紛，特擬定本市房屋租賃管理暫行辦法，業於三十六年八月九日公佈施行。現該局經邀請本市各有關機關團體代表，迭次會商，綜合各方意見後，擬定本市房屋租金標準草案，提出昨日府市政會議通過，將送參議會議決後施行。茲錄房屋租金標準如下：（一）本市房屋租金以民國二十六年租額爲基數，其戰前租額無法査明或房屋在二十六年以後建築者，其基數由地政局比照鄰近同類房屋估定之。（二）居住用屋之租金，其最高額應以本市前三個月職員及工人房屋類指數之平均數爲準。（三）敎人員居住房屋之租金，其最高額不得超過公敎人員生活指數百分之十。前項所稱公敎人員，以其薪給確依公敎人員生活指數計算者爲限。其已領有房貼者，不在此例。（四）凡學校慈善團體自治機關文化社團租用之房屋，及租金基數不滿法幣十元之房屋，均準用前條之規定。（五）凡在民國卅五年八月十六日本市解救房荒治本辦法公佈以後新建之房屋，其租金不受本標準之限制。（六）租賃當事人間，如因支付租金發生爭議時，得依土地法第一〇一條之規定，申請地政局調處之。（七）本標準自公佈日施行。</p>
<h3>地政局解釋　房租調整方式</h3>
<p>昨據地政局負責方面語記者：午前市政會議所通過之「上海市房屋租金標準草案」，第二項所指居住用屋之租金，其最高額以本市前三個月職員及工人房屋類指數之平均數爲準，即今後房屋指數每隔三個月調整一次，而後三個月之房租，依據前三個月之職員及工人房屋類平均指數計算。例如本年「四」「五」「六」三個月房租，依據「一」「二」「三」三個月之平均指數計算，以下照此類推，將來由市府統計處每隔三個月公布一次。又全市各三房客，將同樣遵守房屋租金標準辦理。</p>
<h3>商聯會反對　照指數計算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」南京路商聯會理監事王廉方，劉協勛，蔣仲和，孫文毅等，爲反對房租依照生活指數計算，特於昨日下午六時，假大東酒樓招待各界，到市參議員郭琳爽，邵永生，鄭壽芝，美豪，張一渠，費樹聲，尹集謙，王興同，陳存仁，張中原，史致富，馬君碩，楊撫生，老閘區區長李汝椿，律師鄭文楷曁工商各界代表五十餘人。席間交換意見，咸表同情。商聯會堅決表示調整房租絕對不能以生活指數計算，其理由如下：（一）房租不能以物質計算，非但有法律規定，當局早有令禁。今地政局召集會議，將按生活指數計算，無異照物質收租，有背法令（二）生活指數之計算，是以衣食住行之支出，平均而成。若房租再按生活指數計算，是反因爲果，相互上昇，生活指數上漲，將無止境（三）房租可以按生活指數計算，則一切物價皆可藉口照生活指數計算。（四）戰前房屋造價，與戰前銀行存款利息相仿，今日銀行對於戰前存款，已有明令支付辦法，現在房租已較戰前存款倍數爲多，決不能再行增漲。（五）若云救濟房荒，祗能獎勵新造房屋，因新造房屋造價不同，且現在新造房尾租金，本來不在限制。（六）依照法律，房租原應根據地價，目前房租已超過地價法定應得之倍數甚多。（七）勝利後受共匪戰亂，人民皆忍痛犧牲，希望匪平之後，法幣即可穩定，地產商皆資產階級，獨不能忍受一時，祗圖謀利，要暴漲房租，以造成生活指數上漲，而使多數人民加重負担，倘因而使各物暴漲，實背當局抑低物價之原旨。（八）若云房租依照生活指數計算，是顧全少數業主之權利，試問我國多數農民，辛苦種米，當局尙爲全國人民着想，勿使暴漲，是農民痛苦，應比地產商先須顧及。（九）戰前房屋，業主收租，包括自來水，房捐，修理費，管理費一切在內，現在以上各費均已由房客自理，業主所費有，祗納地稅義務及收租員之費用，有何巨大開支可言。（十）地政局召集與議房租之各機關，祗有房地產業代表發言，而代表全市居民之各房客聯誼會則無一人被邀參加陳述理由，顯有偏袒。</p>

<h3>美孚收帳員黑心　侵吞七十億破案　化整為零·準備逃港　被捕後態度泰然竟說道「成事在天」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市美孚火油公司，本月二日曾被收賬員黄里民侵佔賬款達七十億元之鉅，事後黄即逃匿無蹤，直至四日上午始被該公司總賬房史横司發覺，即經報吿警察總局偵緝科，由　科長飭派外事偵査股長陶根榮，幹員陳福康，張金奎等着手偵査，於當日午後四時，即設法將黄犯拘獲，並陸續追回贓款六十億元，該案昨始吿偵査究畢，定今日移送地檢處。綠黄原籍廣東，年僅廿五，係本市聖約翰火學畢業生，現住東長治路五十三號，戰時曾任中央軍校東南幹訓團少尉軍官，勝利後即奉派來滬，調任海軍部服務，去年因故辭職，旋老取　孚火油公司任收賬員，平時沉默寡言，深爲</p>
<p>上級器重詎去年六月間，不幸爲美軍軍車輾傷左腿，迨傷癒重返服務時，因醫華費等支出過鉅，生活即感困難，而公司　進出賬款，動輒百億以上，黄一時利慾薰心，一念之差，竟造成此一驚人侵佔鉅案。本月二日上午，黄奉派赴陳納德將軍所主持之行總空運大隊收取汽油脹款國幣七十億元，當時因見所付之金城銀行（一月三十一日期）本票，並無抬頭，認爲</p>
<p>機會難逢，即持票至中國航空公司，向該公司會計員顧達千諉稱：因受親友囑託，請其代爲設法拆放生息，顧　與黄友善，亦不疑其他，惟謂如許鉅款，恐一時不易拆出，改約於午後再行決定，至期顧僅拆出廿億，餘款擬開具交通銀行支票找還時，黄即聲稱恐今後拆放不便，請其分作廿五張，每張票面二億元，翌日（三日）黄特票向交通銀行以一部份</p>
<p>兌取現款，餘數全部掉換該行本票後，即至永安公司選購名貴手表六只，派克筆五枝，國際手飾公司選購上好鑽戒四只，各重二克拉餘，復在黑市中購就美鈔一千元，同時黄已準備潛逃赴港，並爲避免警務當局注意，擬由滬搭輪赴漢，再由粤漢路南下轉港，故於四日上午再至南京東路愼昌鐘表行續購</p>
<p>名貴手表四只，全數以交通銀行本票付給之，惟該行職員爲愼重計，須於票款收到後午後始可交貨，黄唯唯而退。其時美孚公司總賬房史横司於四日審査賬册時，發現空運大隊之賬款尙朱入賬，遂加追究，詎黄已兩日未至公司辦公，經電陳納德詢問，始悉，已於二日上午付訖，乃一面報吿警察總局，一面即請陳納德通知金城銀行將</p>
<p>該票止付，經金域銀行査出該票當日係由交通銀行提出交換，乃轉知交行止付，再由交行通知顧達千，其時適愼昌鐘表行派員前往兌現，故即由交行通知警局，而警局方面自接獲美孚公司之報吿後，已派陶股長率同幹員四出偵査，至此乃馳往調查，知黄將於午後赴愼昌行取表，遂</p>
<p>不動聲色，先在該行守候，迨黃午後到來，即予逮捕，帶局偵訊，供出前情。黄被捕後，態度泰然，尙謂「謀事在人，成事在天」云云。現該案大部份贓款已由警局吊回，並定今日移送地檢處訊辦。</p>

<h3>春到金城</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州十五日航訊〕中國人是不忘情於廢曆新年的，在西北各地尤然。靑，寗兩省的農民節，已準於本月五日舉行過了，據說很是隆重；但本省的農民節，則改在上元節盛大舉行，使勞苦終年的農友們，過一個眞正是自己的快樂節日。近日來各鄉鎭保甲正忙於籌齊慶祝農民節的儀式——社火，其耗資之鉅，自在意料之中，但讓大衆把壓抑經年的情盛，發洩在　　的社鼓和一切縱情的聲色裏，倒也是俯順輿情的德政。</p>
<p>蘭州新聞界同業，新年沒有休假，索興在舊年時「休」個痛快，一「休」便是四天。新正初四纔開始上班。在沒有出報的四天裏，大家像一個盲者，無法得悉瀋陽的戰况倒底如何？有些人特地在商店裏借到收音機，想聽聽廣播，還沒扭開便停電了。蘭州電廠起初是公佈隔三天分區停一次電，這就是說，四天內三天有電。可是電廠不能履行諾言，今天索興公佈，隔三天才分區供一次電，如此四天內只有一天有電了。今天記者同幾位朋友談起蘭州的電燈，據說現有的五部發電機，只能發九百七十餘基羅瓦特的電，要供給四千戶和八十幾個工廠的用電，超過它的能力四倍，早已無法負荷了。近半年來偸電之風特盛，用變壓器的頗不乏人，電廠旣不敢査，査出來也無可奈何，那能呌電燈亮？如今新春伊始，有閑者與有錢者正好竹戰通脊，或沙蟹半夜，怎能不呌由三天「停」一次到三天「供」一次？另一個原因是：蘭州光熱的源泉阿干鎭煤礦，廢年封洞四十天，煤源暫吿斷絕，電廠旣浦力購儲一個半月的用煤（約千餘噸），只好把過錯委之機器，藉故停個不亦樂乎。而電廠的新發電機器材，只啓運了一半，還遲滯中途，其餘一半尙在上海，假如這批機器的運費（約兩百多億元）弄不到的話，長此以往，整個的蘭州市，勢將陷入黑暗的深淵裏！</p>
<p>在一燈如豆的情况下，大家的情緒特別壞。</p>
<p>不幸的事件　層見迭出：十日下午四時許，蘭大附中的理化敎員李承弼被人暗殺，槍彈由右脅下射入，穿背而出，當時鞕炮之聲不絕，致未引人注意，兇手已從容潛逃。十二日下午三時許，林森路梁君淑和同院梁成玉由口角而漫罵，卒致梁成玉棒擊梁君淑，次晨傷重而逝。十二日夜，少年馬伯成（十九歲）因看戲歸家過晚，被其父斥責，詎料竟上吊死身。本年元月卅一日因製鞭炮而引着火藥轟炸在傷的張樹榮和張德林，也於十三日先後不治而亡。十四午前，一個少婦因家庭糾紛跳入黄河冰窟自殺，也無法施救。這一連串的兇殺社會新聞，不來則已，來則不休，像上月裏的火災似的。　春節裏的公務員上班</p>
<p>採取值班式，留一兩人留守，而這少數的留守人也很少有盡忠職守的，某長坐着公家的汽車，從廢曆初一到初五，每天上午八時到深夜十一時，整整拜了五天年，每天要耗公家的汽油十加侖以上；公用事業除了交通汽車外，郵電都是値班式，已談不到效率了。倒是娛樂塲所倍加熱鬧，排隊搶票是久難一見的精彩表演。初一初二的蘭園溜冰比賽，也吸引了成千近萬的觀衆。窮人領到十幾萬元的冬賑款，恰好買斤把灰麵，　在窑洞裏也過去這一個年。春風甫來，紅盤未開，百貨無市裏，大米悄悄地由二百五十萬躍過三百萬大關，灰麵不甘落後，也由一百萬百公斤跳到百六十萬，不能一日無銷塲的香烟，快增價百分之三十，據熟悉商情的人談：紅盤開後先漲後穩，至於漲到什麼程度再穩，這位先生已「工顧左右而言他」了。留京五月的</p>
<p>張治中主任，突於十三日自天而降，銀白色的「天雄」號專機，掠過蔚藍的晴空和皓素的雪山，給歡迎的行列帶來了希望和安慰；在軍官集會所裏，記者們包園了西北四將領——張治中·陶峙岳·郭寄嶠·馬步芳——合攝了一影，來紀念這一次的重晤。正如某報小論上說：「行轅張主任回來了，帶給我們以極大的興奮和安慰！……因爲有了他，才能使西北產生力量，走上康莊的道。在春節當中，張主任回來了，這表示「春天」來到了西北。西北將隨着春天的來到而欣欣向榮！」西北的人民，倒眞的希望，希望張主任是「春天」的化身—（本報記者宋炳林）</p>

<h3>歐陸紀遊　（四）</h3>
<p>— 李漢魂</p>
<p>訪問工黨</p>
<p>與昭掄同訪工黨Transport　House，與其負責人談話近兩小時.初由菊芳發問關於婦女之問題：問：工黨之婦女政策如何？答：工黨執政後，對婦女政策積極改進，摘要言之：</p>
<p>（一）對婦女就業機會及婦女工人所需求之設備，如托兒所，飯廳，厠所等，力求增加及改善，因此女工人數，現已增加約一百萬人。</p>
<p>（二）婦女工資待遇，向比男子爲低，除醫生與寫作家外，普通約差百分之三十。現法律已規定一體待遇。惟因舉國經濟困難，一時尙未能實支。</p>
<p>（三）孕婦，產婦及五歲以下兒童，由國家供給特別營養。如牛奶，橙汁，魚肝油，維他命等。死亡率經已减少。五歲以上兒童之維他命及其他營養品亦供給一部分，二年以後，可全部供給。</p>
<p>（四）國家保險法已由國會通過，明年可實施。屆時，每人每日可得五仙令之伙食費，兒女在一個以上者，可得國家補助。</p>
<p>（五）國家醫生服務法，亦於明年實行。醫生國有，醫生一切需要一由國家供給；普遍設立衛生服務站，每站有若干醫生，爲人民免費　病。服務站之經費，由工廠供給，嬰兒在四歲前及四歲後分作兩部份，由國家醫生經常檢查</p>
<p>問：英國婦女喜好家庭生活抑社會生活？一般家庭人口若干？</p>
<p>答：英國一般婦女皆喜好家庭生活，但窮苦者爲生活所迫不得不出外謀生。戰後靑年婦女多喜社會工作，政府之社會服務機關設有輪流女工服務人員，輔助產婦及病人，但婦女多不願任此職務。英國家庭普通爲四人，即兩夫婦與兩兒童，鄉間或窮苦家庭人口較多。戰後生產率較戰前增大。</p>
<p>問：婦女受敎育機會是否與男子均等？</p>
<p>答：英國學制五歲至十一歲受初級敎育，十一歲至十五歲受第二級敎育，均强迫性。每級亦同時可以自修參加會考，會考及格，便可升學；但入大學時需經過入學考試，頗爲嚴格，能升大學者不多。現全國大學生八萬人，婦女佔二千五百餘。</p>
<p>關於婦女問題，問答至此吿終，菊芳因有事先行辭去，由余再與接談：　問：工黨執政後之重要措施及效果，可得聞乎？</p>
<p>答：工黨之最後目標，爲經濟平等，而政治仍保持自由。蓋以前資本主義之最大弱點；一爲獨佔，二爲不均，三爲失業者多。現工黨政策，爲針對此三個弱點，以期達到全國無獨佔，無不均，亦無失業之現象。其重要措施爲：</p>
<p>（一）几煤，電，鋼鐵，交通，與一銀行等重要事業，均由國營。其一中一部份早已實行，一部份正在一準備。</p>
<p>（二）推行國家保險法及醫生國家服務法等新法案，並加軍所得稅遺產稅等徵收，使人民經濟日就平等，生活水準逐步提高。</p>
<p>（三）關於人民就業問題，已有新計劃與法案，現失業者衹達百分之二，當進一步使由减少失業以至消除失業。</p>
<p>問：事業國營而後，效率有無增减？</p>
<p>答：最近一年度全國生產額，比前一年度已增加百分之五，而以煤業爲最顯著。最大原因為職工與其受雇於私人，毋寗受雇於國家。又以工人可參加管理，旣符經濟民主原則，效率亦能合理增加。</p>
<p>問：生產額旣日漸增高，何以一般生活水準仍在低降？有無顧慮因此招致人民不滿而為反對黨所乘？</p>
<p>答：因目前標　在於將生產總額增高，故所得多用於設備及事業拓張方面，一時尙未能增高生活水準，惟仍在逐步改進。現糖及食糧俱日有增加，相信一九五〇年必可完成計劃。反對黨絕不高明，更不能有何奇蹟，深信工黨必得人民擁護。</p>
<p>問：富豪資金有無外逃之虞？</p>
<p>答：政府管理嚴密，銀行又爲國有，故難外逃；而且國家並未否認私有財產，在理，亦無外逃之必要。</p>
<p>問：工黨現行政策，是否能達到眞正經濟平等之路？　答：工黨現行政策，要使全國人民在經濟上無乏匱乏之虞，無不安之虞，無不均之虞。英國人爲注重實際之民族，爲滿足吾人實際之要求與適用，吾人正向此道邁進，以期達到不流血之社會革命成功。　問答已畢，負責人以參考材料多種相贈。旋向其圖書供應部購買，參考書數册。詎行逾兩街口，該售書老婦急步趕到，謂一時算錯，多收兩仙令半，請留候俾其往取送來，或同回收取；蓋於發覺時，恐稍延追趕不及，故未及帶來也。當即隨往取回，老婦道歉多謝不迭。昭掄笑謂：「此英國人之所以爲英國人歟」。</p>

<p>崎嶇大道　一日游覽英倫市郊名勝，已畢，與友人硏討若千重要問題之後，靜坐冥想，對於英國歷史與工黨現行政策發生濃厚之興趣。下文爲當時日記中之一段，附錄於此，以作遊英觀感之結論。</p>
<p>當中世紀中葉，歐陸諸國尙在進行其慘酷之宗敎戰爭時，大不列顚已開始其王室政治之改革；當近世之初，歐陸諸國尙在進行其結束封建殘餘之鬥爭時，大不列顚王國已開始其產業革命。逃避歐陸若干仳紀戰爭之慘禍，接受文藝復興以來歐陸各國哲學思潮與科學發明，靜居三島之盎格撒遜民族，七八百年來，在政治，經濟，文化各方面分頭並進，因而自十八世紀起大不列顚王旗遍挿全世界，贏得日不落國及海上覇王之英名。此資本主義之英國文化，誇耀於全世界足達二百年之久。</p>
<p>剝復相循，理有固然。當資本主義文化在英倫閃　萬丈光芒之時，同時露出破綻。當十九世紀中末葉，英倫烟突之多爲世界冠，但其貧民窟亦著名於當世。爲解決勞資衝突，英國思想家　擬若干針對實際問題之方案。溫和的社會生義，費邊主義，基爾特主義皆爲此種方案之代表作。</p>

<h3>棉紗議價提高　廿支較上期升一五〇萬斤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管當會昨又調整棉紗議價，廿支紗新價爲四三五〇萬元，較前　高一五〇萬元。</p>
<p>該會昨繼續　託紡建公司，在紗業公會開紗十八種，實售十四種，准購各支紗四三一件，准購者七五戶。售價廿支金鷄紅人鐘四八〇〇萬元，金雙鷄·五于·醒獅·四六五〇萬元，雙喜·帆船·四七〇〇萬元，六支　日光二千萬元，十支立馬二八〇〇萬元，藍鳳卅二支六二〇〇萬元，四十支六七〇〇萬元，四二支雙股七七〇〇萬元，卅二支雙股仙桃六六〇〇萬元。</p>

<p>紗價升降互見</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市況，晨開以紡建公司紗價提高，更以外匯掛脾提升，因此人心奮發，各檔均開高盤。四十二支藍鳳細紗會叩八千萬關，嗣因紡建見高再度懸牌，同業人心方轉虛軟，收盤稍形回低。但結果比上日仍軋漲一百萬元，全日趨勢，廿一支現雙馬因受賣方壓力，曾進五千萬關，後以抵補者多，仍站隔日之五千一百五十萬元，十六支等粗紗則均盤小，其他各支紗價升降互見。</p>
<p>布疋止跌回漲</p>
<p>昨日棉布市況，初開因紡建大批布疋開出，籌碼充裕，同業頭寸步緊，散戶相繼斬售，實力派重高即吐，市呈路下　。嗣至十點後，因外匯掛高，花紗再漲，長江帮頻加收吸，染廠亦來吸納，浮空紛起抵補，市勢頓吿緊悄，行情止跌回揚。結果十二磅龍頭等各細布，比上日升四萬至一·二萬元，嗶嘰市亦回秀，其餘各布市氣亦都轉堅。</p>
<p>現棉趨勢高翔</p>
<p>昨日現棉市況繼續回翔，趨勢俏利，同業競進，市價節節上揚。棉商與紗管會簽訂搶購棉花條約，均須實物抵押，故同業均以現貨儲備，因之市上買氣濃厚，需要轉旺，後市仍多看高。全日成交八九八包，送廠價做沙市一〇〇包價九五〇萬七千，棧交價做開沙市八七六萬五千至九一七萬六千，漢細八一〇萬至八三五萬，成交七九八包，火機八〇〇萬，下水價，周浦籽花二〇〇萬，因各　飛升，軋升十一萬五千。</p>
<h3>人絲疲後回堅　廠經喊價穏定</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市先疲後堅，終與上日相仿，一二〇號旭牢及金三馬有光，上午開盤在一千三百萬元左右，後首人心甚堅，中午收盤升至五百萬元即期價，隔日期喊六百萬元。下午交易甚寂，行情並無變化，最後仍喊六百萬元賣出價，比上日最後價短二百萬元</p>
<p>廠經昨市堅穩，成交價與上日上午相仿，C字等級成交十五包，價做一千三百五十萬元，高零擔一千萬元及一千二百萬元均有做開，不過俱係同行交易，實銷可稱全無。干經去胃更呆，行情亦無升降。</p>
<p>細貨昨　先疲後昂，結果與上日軋平。　强眞絲被面，開市在七百萬元左右，買氣甚濃，漸呈上升，收市做到八百萬元。大誠格子璧縐先喊二十萬元，收市爲二十萬〇三千元，其他各貨，均與上日行情相同。</p>
<h3>日紡織業猛進</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據日本報紙所載，日本紡織業正突飛猛進。日本紡織業聯合會所擬　本紡織品輸出計劃中，規定本　輸出布疋十億萬碼，預計本　豐進原棉一，三三〇，〇〇〇包，百分之七十自美國輸入，百分之廿七自印度輸入，百分之三自埃及輸入。本年度日本將裝置紗錠三，三七七，〇九一枚，其中二，九〇八，五九三枚開工，預計可出產二十支紗一，一〇〇，〇〇〇件，其中九〇〇，〇〇〇件輸出。輸出地爲荷印·暹羅·印度·阿富汗·英國·瑞典·及其他各國，此實爲我國紡織業之最大勁敵。</p>
<h3>煙皂均見盤低</h3>
<p>昨日捲於市况，晨開時聞永泰和對大同行祗有白錫包一種烟派配，同業採辦仍吒，喊價上升。後以業中頭寸軋緊，浮多爭吐，行情乃見盤低。但結果十支大英及老刀兩烟，比上日仍續漲四十萬及廿萬元。華商條烟　鼠及三貓微小，餘均步秀。惟美貨馬立斯及五十支茄立克三五牌烟下挫日用品肥皂市面，因固本祥茂同時派配，同業頭寸步緊，躉額抵補甚少，僅大同行略有零碎交易，喊價初高繼低。結果固本皂做三百十萬元，比上日回降二萬元，箭刀皂二百九十七萬元，跌七萬元。此外祥茂光華美麗等皂軋小二萬至十萬之譜。</p>
<p>火柴美麗鳳凰兩牌，交易尙佳，升十萬元。雜牌則均軋落三四十萬不一。</p>
<p>火油同業互做不弱，高度桶貨八百卅萬元，聽裝美孚亞細亞做九十五六萬元，軋好一·二萬元。</p>

<h3>天雨到貨稀少　米價迂迴上升　未登記米號社局停止配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因天雨關係，到貨稀少，南市登記一三七一石八斗，北市祗七〇石，其中白元五五石，陰元一五石。塲外價續昂。社會局依一百七十五萬價，前昨二日在市塲各配售一〇九二五石予一六九八家米號。今日起，無糧商登記執照之米號，社會局不擬予。</p>
<p>又訊：米市緩緩上升，幸社局配米不斷，尙能應市，故雖漲而未見過力。昨南市塲晨開有少數蕪秈，以一百九十五萬加佣開出，塲外供應仍少，白粳續高至二百二十萬元，薄稻二百十五萬，早稻二百十萬，各漲約五萬元。社局配米按照上日之辦法，配出約一萬〇九百五十石，白元無配一貨，塲外價高達二百三十萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>因小麥小廠開價已高至一百四十萬元，原料旣昂，成本自增。又以無錫價格不低，故貨主仍圖扳高，各粉遂再挺升。老車粉衝破百萬大關，爲一百〇二萬元。兵船粉亦抵達百萬大關，紅蜂·建成·均徘徊百萬關口。麩皮再升四五萬，大包麩一度爲六十九萬，後六十七萬，小包麩四十五萬。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>繼續向高峯挺晉，黄豆因油廠及客帮有納胃，加　本街銷塲亦活，漢口乍豆一百四十萬，約昂五萬。平湖特粗豆竟開高達一百八十萬，漲十五萬左右，以其到貨减少也。揀靑西路貨到稀，價位本低，昨勁升二十萬。苞米靑帮納取，至後市尤堅，漲五萬至十萬元。紅糧亦挺十萬，菉豆昂七八萬，本街去化甚多，芝蔴津帮不納，市呈定勢。生仁中次貨廣帮納升二三十萬，高貨升十餘萬。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>初疲後升，豆油收市與上日相仿，生油軋漲五萬，二者市勢則甚堅秀，初因上日升高過鉅，回籠貨乘高出籠者甚多，廠豆油曾低至四百六十八萬元，臨收聞無錫價不低，貨生售意又淡，加以雜糧價昻，本街見機多納，遂又回漲。最後大有餘豆油又至四百八十萬元，吉桶生油初以五百二十萬成交，後市升爲五百三十萬，計挺五萬。生蔴油初小少交，熟菜油挫十萬，吉桶小車蔴油天津帮不納，急降二十五萬元，豆餅稍升一二萬。</p>
<h3>台灣紡織事業中　蔴紡業基礎較厚　吳味經實地考察後之談片</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經氏，此次爲洽購合灣黄蔴種，及視察該省紡織業情形，曾於二月七日飛台，業於十九日公畢返滬。承語記者：台灣紡織業中，以蔴紡業較有基礎。蓋該省糖米兩項特產，年須蔴袋一千五百萬隻。棉紡業設備，尙係日人於太平洋戰後拆遷至台。刻共有紗錠二萬九千枚，現實開十萬四千枚。惟開工效率僅七千枚。而台省每年需要棉紗約五萬件，欲配合該項需要量，須有十萬紗錠之設備，方克有濟。故台省目前所需棉紗，十分之九仍須仰給外省。惟台省業置棉紡廠之條件甚優，例如：（一）台中氣候奇佳。（二）電力廉，每度台幣四十元。（三）人工廉，工資平均每人每月合幣　萬五千元。（四）工人紀律嚴明。</p>
<p>紡織原料，黄蔴現年產三萬担，苧蔴一萬三千担，亞蔴現產量較少。棉花現年產二千担。蠶絲現年產三百餘祖。各項紡織原料之經濟價値，以黄蔴爲最高。故台省府積極推廣黄蔴。紡建此次在台購得黄蔴種二七〇担，　將在杭州附近推廣。</p>
<p>紡織設備，鈔紗二萬　千枚，實開一萬四千枚。織機二千五百台，實開五百台。蔴紡錠五千四百枚實開四千八百枚。蔴紡三千四百台，實開二千四百台。毛紡錠八百五十枚，實開二百枚。　絲　二十五合。和紡機　萬餘台，　開三萬　台。</p>

<p>〔本報無錫廿日電〕此間今日物價愈跳愈狂，已造成全面漲風。市塲投機者交頭接耳，一片黑市聲。米糧因天雨迎棉，到源稀少，客帮進胃濃郁，有供不應求之勢。白粳初盤二〇九〇〇〇〇，昇至二一四〇〇〇〇，白元二二七〇〇〇〇，羊秈稻八七三〇〇〇，埠稻八五六〇〇〇，元稻九五五〇〇〇，小麥二七五〇〇〇〇，白麥二八〇〇〇〇〇，麪粉一〇五〇〇〇〇，荳油五〇〇〇〇〇〇，棉紗五二〇〇〇〇〇〇。</p>
<p>業外刺激又起　華股盤旋向榮　華股昨銀根更濫，業外刺激復乘時興起，低後易回，消息紛歧，大戶採取短綫行動，頗爲　忽，盤旋之中，頗露向榮潛勢。　晨初以美貸加濃，但工貸亦露端倪，開出平穩，榮辱俱微，永紗以八二八元及八五四元價開市，外匯掛高，一六〇號等進即交，一七三號等進遞交，升至八五〇元及八七〇元，一五七號等出即交，六一號等脫售遞交，退至八二八元及八五〇元低價。塲外息價開低至一角九分半及二角四，一八九號等進即交，三三一號等進遞交，水紗乃漲到八五〇元及八七三元，以圈外刺激又起也。一五七號等仍售即交，一二號出遞交，塲外低於塲內，午收爲八四一元及八六七元。較前收即交股計國貨中紡火柴麗安新華均平，永紗閘北榮豐美亞華豐新光永公景福勸興內衣微升，餘均微挫。遞交股信和尙平，餘均微升。</p>
<p>後市已無須兩天貼息，永紗上塲升爲八五〇元及八七四元，一五二號雖賣到八四八元及八六三元，一五七號等來進，尤以二一三號所買最多，圈外刺激加强，漲到八六八元及八七八元高價。一一七號等連袂脫手，國行差進不少，跌至八四七元及八六二元低價。北帮九四號等進至八五二元及八六三元收市。較晨收計即交股華豐升半成，永紗統益商務火柴景福勤興內衣中法新華信和微升，新光國貨麗安永公尙平，閘北榮豐微挫。遞交股華豐升半成弱，勤興微升，信和仍平，餘均微挫。塲外各未上市股票公用股略疲，文化股見穩，餘均平和。</p>
<h3>統債套買居多　外股普遍上升</h3>
<p>公債昨套買交易居多，丁戊遂較穩健，統丙晨開八萬元，低價七萬六，高價八萬一，而後以盤局結束。較前收計甲乙丙跌二千元，丁戊平平，成交約二百萬元。　外股昨經外匯調整掛牌後，業外刺激復起，買風擴大熱股所漲不少。怡紗晨開七三萬，躍升至八二萬新高價結束。散戶供給，證券帮及洋商買進，較前收計電話有求少供，漲起最多。怡紗英聯怡啤鋼業各漲一成强，會德豐業廣紙版升半成，電車及橡皮股平庸。</p>
<h3>防止物價上漲　繼續抽緊銀根</h3>
<p>政府以紅盤後之物價，又起漲風。為遏止起見，決加緊抽緊銀根，仍採配售與拋售物資方式，使法幣回籠。日前政府掌握物資機關，已一度愼密商討，並於十九日起開始進一步採取行動。故前日已有大量差進，數額達五千餘億之多，將連續大量差進，預計差進三萬億時，銀根即吿奇緊，物價可下跌轉穩。配售物資，爲紗·布·糖·油·鹽·人造絲等，米·油等則拋售。至此次物價漲風，係晨歷年後各地游資，又陸續湧到，華北佔十之七八。而華北游費，又係東北流入，華北僅爲其轉口站。上海為游資之最終目的地，故物價首先受其影響。政府之抽緊銀根，僅屬治標辦法，聞將着手根本之解決。</p>
<h3>西安物價續漲</h3>
<p>〔本報西安廿日電〕西安物價，在游資操縱下，日來繼續上漲，尤以紙烟紗布爲甚。昨日一天，紙烟每箱即上漲三四百萬，紗價亦由三九〇〇萬升爲四一〇〇萬。從市塲交易繁盛情况以觀，漲風大有繼續演進之勢。</p>
<h3>茶市前途明朗</h3>
<p>連日以來，紅絲茶花色，吐納談判雖基當塵上，惜各貨產存仍屬寥落，　賣方一味以奇貨可居，喊價不　弛。收市結果，雙方依然陷於相互擯持之間，交易陰霾若昔，而潛勢則堪稱悄秀。價格方面，堅守原陣。茲據　中人云：日前本街與蘇州一帶之買勢頗爲阡盛，且尤以中檔紅茶，所吸又多。綜觀此種情形，茶市前途，恐愈將炫耀。</p>
<h3>茶協電請開放茶貸</h3>
<p>中國茶業協會全體理　事，廿日爲請政府援照絲貸辦法，迅定茶貸方案，電呈財經農等部曁有關機關，請規定每担茶價，以交換食米三担爲標準。農商墊款，以一成爲度。並請就規定貸款限額中，以半數交中農貸放，半數撥交中央合作金庫及各省省銀行轉貸各地茶商茶農及茶葉生產合作社。並責成各省經放機構，保障本息，增進產量，藉以仰副政府推廣輸出　安民生而遏亂源之主旨。</p>
<h3>庫款因公輕匯　收據準免印花</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於轉移庫款之匯款正式收據，應否索貼印花一節，頃據財政部直接稅署解釋稱：「各級政府，或自治機關，處理公庫金或公款所發之憑證，依法應免貼印花。轉移庫款之匯款正式收據，如該項匯款爲各機關轉發所屬經　費，或匯發出差人員之出差旅費，均准免貼印花稅票。惟匯發出差人員之薪津，及匯發直接債權人之採　費，其收據仍應依法貼用印花稅票。」聞國行國庫局，已通函各分行處査照辦理。</p>
<h3>工業原料挺秀</h3>
<p>工業原料市面，以來源不繼，存底日减，各方需買頗健，行情異常挺秀。更因美匯提高，人心更形緊俏，做開月牌燒碱續漲一百萬元，每桶爲六千三百萬元，美貨燒碱製皂業採辦甚暢，步升二百萬，爲六千一百萬元。此外小蘇扛甘油漂粉精及紅霖鉀粉鋅氧粉，亦均軋好一成有餘。</p>
<h3>木材轉堅</h3>
<p>木材市况，自新春以來，疲軟多時，昨因外匯調整，市况轉佳，杉木市價步趨堅昂。</p>

<h3>漢武帝征和年號考</h3>
<p>— 夏鼐</p>
<p>漢武帝征和年號的征字，在居延發掘得的漢簡中，都寫成『　』或『延』。傅振倫先生說：馬叔平先生釋爲延字；武帝的年號本來是延和（與居延，延壽的延字相同）後人傳寫，誤以延作征，沿至今而不改。（漢武帝年號延和說，見考古社刋第六期）這新說法是根據新材料而來的，驟聞之很覺得動聽。但是細加考査，知道傅氏的說法是站不住的。</p>
<p>漢武帝的年號，原作征和。漢簡上的字，便是征字的別體。居延簡中征和年號凡出現過十次（傅氏謂凡十有二。但是第五三四簡之二及十五，是一簡裂成兩片的，征和二字僅出現過一次。第八簡分號十六，並未見這年號。）這十個征字，都是从正从辵。不過辵字的上半，有時候在正字的下面，像揷圖一的甲式，凡六次；有時候放在正字的右面，像圖中的乙式，凡四見。至於居延，元延，延壽，延年等字，居延漢簡中都曾出現過，尤其是居延二字連文，共出現了三百多次。我曾費了幾天功夫，將勞貞一先生著的居延漢簡考釋釋文一書中所有『延』字一共三百六十二條，一一對照原物的照片（這數字或許有小出入；但縱有一二遺漏，無關要緊。）考査的結果，其中百分之九十三以上，都是从延从ノ，像揷圖一中延字『常例』；偶然也有把廴字寫在止字下面的，不過很罕見，僅有二十簡，佔總數百分之六而已；並且他的首筆總是斜筆，像揷圖一中的延字『變例』。延字的邊旁，可以這樣隨便寫，這是因爲古代文字中辵彳廴三字，實在是一個字的不同寫法（參考羅振玉釋行篇，見貞松老人遺稿甲集內後丁戊稿）漢代雖已加以分化，延字从廴，征字多从彳或辵，但是還未十分嚴格。征延二字的重要區別，是最上一筆是否傾斜或平正。最有意思的是居延簡第五五七之八，『征和四年…居延農亭之長延壽。』（勞氏釋文卷二頁七十）原簡雖有幾處稍模糊，但是征延各字還很淸楚，可以看得出征字最上一筆平正，和延字首筆傾斜者不同（見揷岡二）。</p>
<p>我們現在再用小學訓詁來考究這個問題。說文辵部：延，正行也，从辵，正聲。或从彳作征。（卷二）知道這二字實爲一字的兩種寫法。羅振玉說：从彳之字，古文或彳下增止爲辵；从辵之字，亦或省从彳。羅氏又引錄說文及契文金文爲證，以明二者實爲一字。許愼誤加以區別，訓彳爲小步，象人脛三屬相連；訓辵爲乍行乍止。這完全是望形生義，試看辵部中的字，有那一個是有「乍行乍止」的涵義的？（見羅振玉釋行篇）說文廴部說：延，行也；从廴，正聲（卷二）。說文雖將這字另放在一處；但細察之，與征延實爲一字。像揷圖一所表示的，篆書字體，廴彳很是相近似。羅振玉說：廴部之廴，篆文作个　，古文所無。惟古文彳字或書作　，或書作　，乃一字而寫法稍異，並非兩字。羅氏又引金文鄂侯馭方鼎及無異敦中諸「征」字爲證，推斷定說文中廴部的延字，和辵部的延征，實爲一字。（見羅振玉釋行篇）漢碑中『延』也常寫作『延』，例如華山廟碑，史晨後碑？及吳谷朗碑，可見當時廴辵二者，實是互相通用的。至於居延的延字，說文把他放在延部，从延，ノ聲，長行也（卷二）。與征字及其別體，音旣不同，義也有異。後人大槪因爲征字的別體，很容易和延字相混淆，所以逐漸專用从彳的征字。於是不僅从廴的征字被廢，便是以辵的征字，也不再用了。</p>
<p>古書的校勘學方面，也對於這問題的解決，有點幫助。漢書中征和年號，據王紹蘭說；</p>
<p>考漢書諸侯王表作征和者五；王子侯表作征和者九；高惠高后文功臣表作征和者二，延和者一；景武昭宣元成功臣表作延和者四（師古曰延亦征字也），作延和者八，作征和者一；外戚恩澤侯表作征和者一；百官公卿表作征和者二。志傳亦皆作征和字。（說文解字訂補卷二）</p>
<p>王氏所根據的漢書，不知道是那一種的版本。現在商務影印的北宋景祐本漢書（百納本二十四史中）所有王氏所云作延字的地方，都已延字了。淸殿本漢書中，僅景武功臣表內平曲侯條作以辵的延字，因爲這一條下面有『師古曰延亦征也』一句注語的關係。其餘的地方，都是寫作延或征。這是由於後人轉錄時延字已經廢止不用，所以都改作征字，以求一致。平曲候一條下面有顏師古的注認，如果也改或征字，這注語便變成『征亦征字也』，有點不成話，所以仍能保存原形。至於或寫成延字，那是由於形近致譌。嘉業堂影印的南京鶯洲書院本漢書中各年表，幾乎全部改成征字。僅只平曲侯條及其後的亞谷侯條，寫作延字，大概也是由於這個緣故。年表是史書中比較容易爲人所忽視的部門，並且有師古這一條注語，所以還能遺留這痕跡。由此可以考見古本漢書中征和的征字，或从彳，或从辵，或从廴，並不一致。古時三者互通。顏師古所見的本子，平曲俠條征和的征字是从或廴的，所以注語說『亦征字也』。師古的意思是說二者互通，並非誤字。到後來誤寫作延字。王先謙漢書補注指出延乃延之誤，但是仍以征延二字互通。現在傅振倫先生打算將征和改作延和，是不是爲新材料所震驚，以致誤入了迷途？</p>
<p>友人勞貞一先生也曾注意到這問題，但是未能加以解決。他說：『征和簡文作夏　和，馬叔平先生謂是延字。今但從一般習慣用法，仍書作征和。蓋古人已往，原不必究其命名原意。書作征和，一望而知爲漢武紀年，反較書作延和爲使也。』（史語所集刋十本二分，漢武後元不立年號考注一）但是這不是方便與否的問題，乃是事實眞相問題。所以不殫辭費，詳加考證。</p>
<p>這文初稿寫成後，適陳援庵先生來京，曾求正於陳先生。陳先生云：漢書武帝耙征和年號下應劭注曰言征伐四夾而天下和平。應氏熟於前漢掌故，且其時又距征和不過二百餘年，不應將延字誤讀作征字。故初聞延和年號新說，即蓄疑而不敢信。今獲睹此篇考證，可以渙然冰釋矣。</p>

<h3>南詔史論</h3>
<p>— 向達</p>
<p>——唐代紀載南詔諸書考略—</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>宗咸通時有樊綽　蠻書十卷，　滂的雲南別錄一卷；僖宗時有徐雲雯南詔錄三卷，盧携雲南事狀一卷。樊綽書論見本篇末，茲先略說竇滂諸人書大概。</p>
<p>新唐書及宋史藝文志俱著錄竇滂雲南別錄一卷。竇滂於咸通十年代李師望爲定邊節度使，貪殘失衆望。南詔人犯，滂望風潰退，十一年遂貶爲康州司戶。他寫雲南別錄在何時不可考，通鑑德宗貞元十年袁滋册南詔條考異引滂書一條，說「詔袁滋册異牟尋爲南詔，蓋從其請。南詔之名自此始也。」册府元龜紀貞元時唐賜南詔金印銀窠，文曰「貞元册甫詔印。」南詔德化碑紀天寳十一載閣羅鳳北臣吐蕃，「於鄧川册詔爲贊普鍾南國大詔。」南詔即是南國大詔，貞元册南詔，不過襲吐蕃之舊稱耳。</p>
<p>南詔自酋龍於唐宣宗大中十三年嗣立以來，至僖宗乾符四年，前後幾二十年，幾於歲歲犯邊。乾符四年酋龍死，子法立，侵邊始少息。嶺南西道節度使辛讜與南詔常通使節。乾符六年遣巡官徐雲雯使雲南，二月至善闡城，（今昆明），留十七日而澴。廣明元年六月，又副宗正少卿嗣曹王李龜年使南詔，中和元年八月始還至西川。雲雯於三年之間兩使南詔。他所著的南詔錄三卷見於唐宋藝文志，大約即是綜合兩次出使見聞而成。南詔錄宋以後即不傳，通鑑唐紀僖宗乾符四年二月考異引此書，說「南詔別名鶴拓，其後亦自稱大封人。」南詔國號之又作鶴拓或大封人，始見此書。鶴拓，大封人，作何解釋不得而知，方國瑜先生以爲鶴拓是　馱羅的對音，他從　韻學上推測，轉彎太多，我們總有點不大敢相信。</p>
<p>和徐雲雯南詔錄同時候的書還有雲南事狀一卷，見宋史藝文志。通鑑唐紀僖宗廣明元年五月趙宗政還南詔條考異引雲南事狀，以正西川節度使陳敬瑄遣使南詔之日月，又及豐祐以後漸爲侮慢之故，並謂事狀末載陳敬瑄與雲南書牒，或稱鶴拓，或稱大封人。南詔國號，至南詔錄和雲南事狀始予著錄，則鶴拓或大封人之號，很可能始於僖宗之時。事狀宋史不著爲何人作，溫公考異以爲「似盧攜奏草也。」攜爲僖宗時宰相，辛讜陳敬瑄之遺使南詔許之和親，攜之主張最多。溫公謂事狀爲攜奏草，疑得其實。</p>
<p>南詔和唐朝的關係以懿宗時爲最繁，幾乎每年都有邊警，而以中國的南部如安南邕管爲最甚。成通時安南爲南詔攻陷，於是邕管騷然，乃調東南之兵以戍桂林，卒之龐勛叛變，遂兆唐室滅亡之機。所以安南的得失關係於唐朝者甚大。樊綽就是南詔攻安南時，親歷其事的人，他所著的蠻書都是在安南時搜集得來的材料，予以有系統的編纂，華陽國志而後，現存論述西南歷史地理最古最好的紀載，只有樊綽此書</p>
<p>樊綽書新唐書宋史藝文志著錄俱作十卷。樊氏籍貫無可考，爲安南經略使蔡襲從事。咸通三年襲奉命經略安南，其年冬南詔大舉來攻，四年春安南陷，襲闔宗死者七十人，綽涉江跳免。蠻書之作，大約始於在安南時，蔡襲失敗之後，所以令本蠻書卷十末云二</p>
<p>臣去年正月二十九日，已錄蠻界程途，及山川城鎭，六詔始末，諸種名數，風俗條敎，土宜物產，六瞼名號，連接諸蕃，共篡錄成十卷，於安南郡州江口，附襄州如度押衙張守忠進獻。這大約是在咸通四年。到了咸通五年六月，樊綽左授夔州都督府長史，將蠻書又整理了一次，令本蠻書卷十末論黔涇巴夏四邑苗衆一段有云。（未完）</p>
<h3>沈兼士與近年史學</h3>
<p>— 周祖謨</p>
<p>沈兼士先生於去年八月二日謝世，聞者無不痛悼。先生畢生瘁力於學術事業，推陳出新，與近二十年史學之發展關係至鉅，不可無述，茲分三事言之：</p>
<p>一　個整理明清檔案</p>
<p>凡硏究歷史所最易遇到之困難有四：一爲文獻無徵，二爲記載駁雜，三爲傳說異辭，四爲材料零散。欲除此四難，首當尋獲眞實豐富之史料，有眞實豐富之史料始能有新奇之發現。即如淸代二百餘年之公家文書，爲研究近代史之絕好資料，然自民國改元以後，迄無人措意。民國二年（一九一三）敎育部設立歷史博物館，曾貯存淸宣統間由內閣大庫移出之檔案，然禁閉錮藏，不數年即幾爲世人所忘。至民國十年（一九二一）忽售於紙行，將用以造紙，事爲羅振玉所知，翌年斥貲萬餘元購回，得以未毀（詳見王靜安先生庫書樓記）。是年北京大學已成立研究所國學門，蔡才民校長聘先生爲主任，先生見羅氏之購求檔案，有慨於心，乃商請蔡先生呈請敎育部將刦餘者移歸研究所整理，是年五月得部令許可，七月開始移接，計奘運六十二木箱，一千五百零二麻袋。其中有自明迄淸之題本·報銷册·揭帖·賀表·貢表·上論。詔書。謄黄。金榜·起居注·及實錄史稿等，因即成立明淸史料整理會，着手整理之。此爲學術機關硏究檔案之始。先生主接　　門儿　年，先　　　其亭者十數人，除區別種類及分別朝代外，並編有明季兵科題行稿摘要彙編，淸九朝京省報銷册日錄，淸代官印譜等書。其中珍貴之史料，如明宣實錄實錄底稿，明世宗實錄底稿，明史料殘本，淸太宗聖訓底稿等，皆足以補官書之闕遺，正史傳之紕繆。</p>
<p>北大所收檔案均爲外庭內閣大庫之物，淸代內庭宮中之檔案，則仍存於故宮。迨民國十三年（一九二四）十一月溥儀出宮，政府方組織淸室善後委員會，會同內政部及地方官署人員接收故宮，點査宮中物品，先生與陳援庵李石曾諸先生同為委員。翌年十月成立故宮博物院，設古物圖書二館，圖書館復分圖書文獻兩部，文獻部即由先生主持，因而集中精力，整齊宮中檔案，於外東路開闢陳列室，摘要展覽。是後又接收宗人府軍機處淸史館各處舊檔，皆依次整理之。十八年（一九二九）二月故宮改組，分立古物岡書文獻三館，張溥泉先生任文獻館館長，而先生副之。是時除將檔案分別整理編目外，並擇錄要件，刊爲當故叢編，後又易名文獻叢編。至於性質類似者，則編爲專刊，分別印行，如三藩史料，文字獄檔案皆是。而所編嘉慶朝外交史料，道光朝外交史料，光緒朝中日交涉史料，中法交涉史料，宣統朝中日外交史料等尤爲重要。</p>
<p>十五年以後館中所藏檔案，約分四類：一爲宮中擋案，二爲內務府檔案，三爲內閣大庫檔案，四爲軍機處檔案，十八年九月復接收舊刑部檔案。二十年春（一九三一）再得淸理東西兩庫，於是此深閉固扃二百餘年古文書之所有底蘊方盡爲世人所知。二十三年（一九三四）七月馬叔平先生長故宮博物院，先生任文獻館館長，以爲向者整理之方法仍有缺失：</p>
<p>（一）太重形式，祗知區分名物排比時代，而忽略檔案之內容。</p>
<p>（二）僅注意檔案本身，而忽略衙署職司文書手續之研究，遂使各類檔案失其聯絡。</p>
<p>（三）過於注重搜求珍貴之史料，而忽略多數平凡資料之普徧整理。</p>
<p>乃重擬計劃，革除舊弊，以全力注重於普徧之整理，並取分藏各處之檔案互相參稽，注意檔案歷史沿革之探討。遂分現存之史料爲若干組，先因名以立類，而後依類別以編目，且擬訂細則，舍去舊日平列式之立類法，而別創有系統之分類法（詳見二十四年先生所著故宮博物院文獻館整理檔案報吿）。當時除編印各種史料外，並出版軍機處檔案目錄，內閣庫貯舊檔輯刋，雍正硃批諭旨不錄奏摺總目，內務府造辦處輿圖房圖目等書，以便學者檢索。</p>
<p>二　提倡考古學</p>
<p>古器物之研究，與於宋代，後復衰微，至淸代阮芸臺吳淸卿等出，始大振絕學，其蒐討之勤，審鑒之精，殆已陸越宋人。惟重於一二器物時代之審定，銘文之考　，尙無綜合之硏究。猶未　宋人以古器物疏證禮輕，以古文字刊正　書之宿習。</p>
<p>至民國　年治此　者，已寥寥可數，雖古物日出無窮，收藏流布者惟羅振玉一人而已。然考古學者研究古器物，除知其形製，明其時代外，尤須知其出土之地點，出土之情形，及與其聯系之一切關係。如此則貴乎實地勘査，並以科學方法施行有計畫之發掘。是以北大硏究所國學門於民國十二年五月成立考古學硏究室，並設立古蹟古物調査會，作調査之實施，並爲發掘與保存之預備。其調充之範圍，分爲古蹟，古器物，古美術品三類。調査之方法，則分照相，摹拓，造型，岡畫，記錄五類。是年八月間，河南新鄭孟津兩縣出土周代銅器甚多，逐請馬叔平先生前往調査，携回拓片照片。並購得孟津所出銅器及車飾等六百餘件。爾後徐旭生李玄伯陳萬里緒先生皆曾參加調査古蹟古物工作。如大宮山明代古蹟之調査，洛陽北邙山出土古物之調査，甘肅敦煌古蹟之調査，並於考古學貢獻甚大。至十六年爲止，所收集之古物，金石甲骨陶器之類凡四千餘件，山西稷山興化寺元代壁畫五十七方，金石拓本一萬二千餘種（見十六年二月硏究所國學門概略）。</p>
<p>三　注意歌謠及風俗之調查</p>
<p>民國九年（一九二〇）十二月北大成立歌謠硏究會，十一年乃歸併硏究所國學門。前後徵集歌謠，約得一萬四千首，並發行歌謠周刋，分省彙錄，共出九十六期。同時出版歌謠叢書數種。民國十二年五月復成立風俗調査會，調査之方法，一爲文字之記錄，一爲實物之徵集。所得材料分於歌謠周刋及民國十四年（一九二五）硏究所國學門周刊發表</p>
<p>由以上三事觀之，足見先生專門之學雖非史學，而提倡風氣之功，誠不可沒。先生嘗謂：「北京大學之於研究國學，風氣凡三變：其始承淸季餘習崇尙古文辭；三四年之後，則倡僕學；十年之際，漸淸於科學，駸駸乎進而用實證方法矣。以爲向來文士盡信書之弊當有以矯之，故研究所國學門於古代研究，則提倡考古學，注重古器物之采集；於近代硏究，則側軍公家檔案及民間風俗；持此縱横兩界之大宗新資料，以佐證書籍之硏究，爲學者闢一新途徑」。（見所作方編淸內閣庫貯舊檔輯刋序）是亦可知光生當日計慮之深也。</p>
<p>考近二十年史學之發展，其憑藉有二：一爲科學實證之方法，一爲新史料之發現。科學實證之方法，自經蔡孑民胡適之兩先生之提倡，爲民國八年五四運動以來之新思潮；新史料之發現，則得助於考古學者爲多。先生固爲五四時代之急進人物，且爲提倡考古學最力之人，故於史學之進展，實有推移之力焉。</p>
<h3>關於詩品的幾個問題</h3>
<p>— 向長清</p>
<p>關於詩品的校勘，倘以四部備要學津討源本校刊本爲據，我們至少可以看出下面的幾個問題：</p>
<p>第一是品錄作者的人數。詩品序云：</p>
<p>「嶸今所錄，止乎五言。雖然網羅今古，詞文殆集，輕欲辨彰淸濁，掎摭病利，凡百二十人。預此宗流者便稱才子。」</p>
<p>四庫全書提要則云：</p>
<p>「嶸學通周易，詞藻兼長，所品古今五言詩，自漢魏以來一百有三人，論其優劣，分爲上中下三品。」又云：</p>
<p>「又百三人中惟王融稱王元長不著其名。」</p>
<p>按詩品所舉者爲百廿人，惟子江祐詩云：弟祀明靡可懷，又于張欣泰云：欣泰子眞并希古勝文，則其所評論的實應爲百二十二人，四庫全書提要之說不知何據？</p>
<p>第二，中品有一魏侍中應璩，下品中復有晋文學應璩。鄙意下品之晋文學應璩實爲魏文學應瑒之誤。魏志曰：</p>
<p>「汝南應瑒字德璉，太祖辟爲丞相掾屬，後爲五官將文學卒。」（據文選引）</p>
<p>由此可見文學應璩當爲應瑒。文選錄其侍五官中郞將建章臺集詩一首。或疑應璩當爲應貞，因貞爲晋人，考　虞文章志曰：</p>
<p>應貞字吉甫，少以才聞，能談論。晋武帝爲撫軍將，軍，以貞參軍，晋室踐祚，遷太子中庶子散騎常侍卒</p>
<p>應瑒曾經作過五官中郞將文學，應貞則作渦撫軍參軍，太子中庶子，散騎常侍等官，可見所謂文學應璩當爲應瑒，而決非應貞。瑒璩二字皆從玉易誤，貞璩二字則相差渦遠矣。或謂詩品的編排係以時代先後爲序，原文的順序，是魏倉曹屬阮瑀，晋頓丘太守歐陽建，晋文學應璩，晋中書令嵇含，晋河南太守阮偘，晋侍中嵇紹，晋黄門棗據，則在晋頓止太守歐陽建後似不應有魏文學應瑒的字樣。但這種說法也不可盡信。大致說起來，以時代先後爲序是不差的。但中間也有少數的例外，如中品魏文帝後爲晋中散嵇康，晋司空張華，接着又有魏尙書何晏，晋馮翊守孫楚，晋著作王贊，晋王司徒掾張翰（按王守應爲衍文），晋中書令潘尼，此後却又是魏侍中應璩了，可見晋頓丘太守歐陽建之後再有魏文學應瑒並不是不可能的事。這或者是由于鍾嶸的疏忽，或者也因爲一兩千年以來傳抄錯誤，才有這種不大規律的現象，我以爲魏誤爲晋，瑒誤爲璩都是很可能的。但文學二字却決不會與撫軍參軍，太子中庶子，散騎常侍之類的東西相混的。况且文選只錄應貞的晋武帝華林園集詩一首，詩爲四言，不在鍾嶸討論之列，更可以說明文學應璩決非應貞了。</p>
<p>第三，四庫提要云：</p>
<p>「史稱嶸嘗求譽于沈約，約弗爲獎借，故嶸怨之，列約中品。案約詩列之中品，未爲排抑，惟序中深詆聲律之學，謂蜂腰鶴膝，僕病未能，雙聲疊韵，里俗己具。是則攻擊約說，顯然可見，言亦不盡無因也。」攷詩品下品序云：</p>
<p>「余謂文製本須諷讀，不可蹇礙。但今淸濁通流，口吻調利，斯爲足矣。至平上去入，則余病未能，蜂腰鶴膝，閭里己具。」我不懂何以原文的「至平上去入，則余病未能，蜂腰鶴膝，閭里己具。」竟被四庫館的學者們引成了「蜂腰鶴膝，僕病未能，雙聲疊韵，里俗己具！』至云是則攻擊約說，顯然可見。」也令人難於索解。詩品序云：「王元長創其首，沈約謝眺揚其波。」可見重要的還是在攻擊王融，沈約謝眺不過是揚其波而已。沈約詩鉀嶸列之中品，提要說：「每品之首各冠以序。」但所謂攻擊云云則在下品的序中，足見沈約謝眺不渦是附帶的被提到而已。至於史稱嶸嘗求譽于沈約，約弗爲獎借，故嶸怨之，到沈約中品」云云，則於第二章中已討論很多，不必再重複了。</p>
<p>第四，四庫全書提要又云：</p>
<p>「又一百三人之中惟王融稱王元長，不著其名，或疑其有所私尊，然徐陵玉台新詠亦惟融書字，蓋齊梁之間，避齊和帝之諱，故以字行，實無他故，今亦姑仍原本，以存其舊焉。」</p>
<p>按詩品序中工元長凡三見：其一云：「近任昉王元長等，詞不貴奇，競須新事，」其二云：齊有王元長者，其三云：王元長其首。但分論中却仍是「齊寗朔將軍王融」，並非王元長，可見是名號幷稱的。名號並稱的例子還有很多，如顏砥之總論中云：「謝客爲元嘉之雄，顏延年爲輔。」分論却是：宋光祿大夫顏延之，其源出於陸機。延之爲名，延年爲字。又總論云：先是郭景純用　上之力變創其體，劉越石仗淸剛之氣，雙成厥美。又云：越石感亂，景純詠仙。而分論却是晋太尉劉現，晋宄農太守郭璞，又總論云：謝益壽斐然繼作，分論却是僕射謝混，此外，王粲，仲宣，劉楨，公幹，潘岳，安仁，張協，景陽，嵇康，叔夜，張華，茂先，劉繪，士章，何晏，平叔，陸機，十衡，左思，太冲，張翰，季鷹，袁宏，彥伯，鮑照，明遠，江淹，文通，任昉，彥昇，沈約，休文，班固，孟堅，趙壹，文勝，徐幹，偉長，阮瑀，元瑜，歐陽建，堅石，實在是舉不勝舉，何能說惟王融稱王元長，不著其名，便是有所私尊？况且詩品序把王融所提倡的聲律之論，攻擊得體無完膚，還能够談得上有所私尊麽？倘能把詩品細續一過，便會知道名與學的使用是頗爲雜亂的，實在不能尋出一條什麽規律。如說本論齊寗朔將軍王融的融字爲後人所改，不能引爲名字並用的證據，則齊司徒長史張融，也應該以字行了。不然則玉融的融字犯齊和帝諱，張融的融字又何嘗不犯諱？因此四庫全書提要所云，簡直便使我們莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>然而這也只是我的一點管見而已。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>窗子</h3>
<p>— 季永</p>
<p>頃續尼赫魯氏著「印度之發現」The　Discovery　of　India書，頗多妙語，氏蓋欲爲印度的歷史及文化辯護者，故稱之爲「發現」。其第七章述英人侵入印度及印度民族運動之嚴起云：</p>
<p>「有的英國人說：我們最惹印度人反感的，無過於所寫作的印度歷史了，這個人可以說是對於印度人有相當了解的。老實說：歷史永遠是勝利者或征服者寫定的。而且是按照他們的觀點。至少，他們的理論是占主要成分。今日印度的憤侶，官史，王者，所謂上等階級是古代從中亞來的雅利安人，亦即是初期的印度征服者，他們在那時寫下了不少歷史，當然，這械東西對於土住的本地人是不公正的。或者，沒有一個人能够跳出自己的民族觀念圈子以外，更難逃掉自己的文化傳統與限制。所以，即使一個人有時表示了公正的見解，說不定在自己的民族眼光中，就認爲這是賣國。特別是戰爭，乃是更顯著的例證。他可以使民族或國家之間完全有計劃的拋棄了公正與眞理，只要是對方認爲是的，我必以爲非，同樣，我以爲是者，對方亦同。於是，人們的心，因而變粗，且閉塞了一切通往眞理的道路，止留下自認爲是的一條。這時候，最大的力量就是把自己的行動說得如何有理，而把對方的駡得狗屁不通。眞理好像從此長埋井底，一任愚魯以最高的力量統治一切。」</p>
<p>英國人所寫的印度史，我們雖尙未詳細硏究，大體恐與日本人所寫的「滿洲史」差不了多少。尼赫魯這一議論，亦即我國　子諸侯之門而仁義存焉，以及老壯的各是其所是各非其所非的理論，不過說得更爲具體明白而已。本來我曾屢次說過，人類的理性十分有限，不可以其為萬物之靈而估計過高，茍子的性惡論比之孟子的性善論未必就算胡說。歷史上的是非，大約正可以代表這種理性的缺乏。鄕里小兒或行車販漿之流，反而可以有一客觀標準以評衡人物，猶之乎看京戲大白臉必是好獪，黑而必是魯鹵一望而知，這大約是受了小說劇本乃至傳說故事民間文學的影響，沒有第二種說法與力量可以矛盾的打消或是相衝突，若是稍稍讀一點書，必會感到若干頭痛的問題，諸如正統的爭執，身後的評驚，各有各的立塲各有各的背景，好像萬花筒一樣，千變萬化，不必史論家作什麽「武穆非忠臣論」「子胥非孝子說」，已足够使人目眩神迷了！何况還有那麼些逢迎時會揣摩苟合的不耍臉知識分子，一定要在王莾的時候劇奏美新，高誦頌聖的詩卷呢！</p>
<p>學歷史者所以易於陷入迷惑中，大半因此。考證家，訓詁者的工作，也便因此而日出不窮。好像狐埋狐榾一樣，自己製造迷凈自己再繞着圈子出來，眞不知所爲何來！胡適之留學日記卷十五第四十八條「諭去無道而就有這」一則，大是　論，今抄之以明上說：</p>
<p>「王壬秋死矣，十年前曾讀其湘綺樓箋啓，中有與子婦書云：彼入吾京師，而不能滅我，更何有瓜分之可言？即令瓜分，去無道而就有道，有何不可！其時讀之甚憤，以爲此老不知愛國，乃作無恥語如此！十年以來，吾之思想，亦已變更，今思去無道而就有道一語，惟不合今世之國家主義耳，平心論之，此語本吾國古代賢哲相傳舊旨，吾輩豈可以十九世紀歐洲之異論責八十歲之舊學家乎？吾嘗謂國家主義（民族的國家主義）但有一個可立之根據，其他皆不足辯也。此唯一之根據爲何？曰：「一民族之自治，終可勝於他民族之治之』一前提而已。譬如我國之排滿主義之所以能成立者，正以滿族二百七十年來之歷史已足證其不能治漢族耳，若去一滿洲得一袁世凱，未爲彼善於此也。未爲彼善於此，則不以其爲同種而姑容之，此二三次革命之所以起也。若以袁世凱與威爾遜令人擇之，則人必擇成爾遜，其以威爾遜爲異族而擇袁世凱者，必中民族主義之毒之愚人也。此即去無道而就有道之意。吾嘗寃枉王壬秋，今此老已死，故記此則以自贖。…』</p>
<p>這是民國六年的話，時袁氏因謀稱帝失敗而死，不久又有宣統帝之復辟，胡氏在美而不久即當回國之時。以袁世凱易咸爾遜，在民族主義上觀之，究竟如何？王壬秋之論，始而是抹殺了正義，繼而一轉，又成了無上的正贛，你試想想，人類的理論與眼光如何可怕！當第一次大戰發生時，英國與德國宣戰，全國徽兵，却有大哲學家羅素起而發起反徵兵協會，Noa—ConscriptionFellowship因此被劍橋大學除名敎授之籍，且治以刑法，這件事，又將怎樣解釋？</p>
<p>曾讀梁徽音一文，名曰「窗子以外」乃是說我們坐在窗子以內的人，對於外面永遠不能了解，這窗十隨我們之所往而存在，於是我們與社會就永遠隔着一層窗，雖然看得見，到底不澈底明白。而且利害無與。號稱到鄕村去的學者靑年，背着照像機，帶了行軍牀到十五世紀生產方式的短布單衣羣衆之中，怎麽會能够打穿彼此的窗十？這話很有趣，使我不禁想起俄皇彼得大帝之建設新都聖彼得堡，自稱爲「打開東歐之窗，以流通西歐空氣。」可見有窗子而一打開，究竟不足以盡窗子之職責。吾人對於同時存在的他人，或者還可能打開彼此間的窗子，開誠心布公道。—但實際上也是頗不容易的，請看今日國際間的糾紛便知分曉了。—但對於隔了幾百年乃至幾千年的古人，如何可以「尙友」，則殊竟成爲疑問。然則這個乃如秦始皇驪山墓地的窗十，一經殯葬，就已封閉，使天下後世徒然想像那魚油的燈，射人的機關與弩箭，而無由一覩其眞象爲何如也歟？</p>
<h3>回憶錄之類</h3>
<p>— 晏如</p>
<p>中國報紙大都有副刋，副刋必有長篇，而長篇必爲小說！抱歉得很，我看了四十多年報紙，就不大看副刋上的長篇小說。不是輕視而是怕煩。徜是舊式小說對話不分行寫的，一天還有點故事好看，若爲新式，則「你好嗎？」他說。「謝謝你，我很好。」她答。</p>
<p>這麼一下，一天只能聽幾句男主人翁的客套，像雷瑪克「凱旋門」那樣的長篇，不知要看幾年才能看完，如雨果「悲慘世界」這種巨著，簡直非十廿年不能登完了。所以在我個人之見，報紙副刋登長篇小說，實不如登回憶錄之類爲佳，申報的赫爾回憶錄就使我天天愛讀，雖然登在副刋裏不能一天幾千字，但因內容是事實，總比「你好我好」好得多。</p>
<p>目前是回憶錄盛行之時，打了幾年仗，雖然天下仍未太平，總算供給了幾個軍政巨頭有寫回憶錄的材料，此仗亦算不虛。昨天報上傳說述東條也要寫了，「留於渠被處決後出版，供瞻養家屬之需」。這是一件好賣買，我想東條就是不被處決亦必一寫。於此可見「大人物」到底做得，無論成王敗寇，爲善爲惡，到了還有寫回憶錄的資格，賺一大筆稿費用。</p>
<p>回憶錄是自傳一類的作品，不過比較局限於一時或一事。有人說傳記之發達與國運之隆盛相關，並舉十九世紀英一國傳記文學之盛為證。雖不知此說確否，但觀乎中國之缺少傳記文學，而中國國運又恰値不見十分興隆，或者也有一點道理。不過中國的缺少傳記文學，大原因我想還在於大人先生的自謙。胡適之先生是有點傳記迷的，東勸蔡孑民先生，西勸張菊生先生寫自傳，而他老先生自己的四十自述，還只述到二十多歲就休息了，看來到他八十歲時才能述全吧，而八十自述又非百歲時不見得動筆。</p>
<p>自傳之外還有傳人，這在中國也不多見。不說別人，連孫中山先生的傳記迄今還沒有一本好好的。所以如此，除有寫傳記資格者的自謙之外，或者與中國人的求全之癖也不無關係。人不是神，缺點是不會沒有的。例如史屈萊契　Lytton　Strachey寫維多利亞女皇傳，裏邊對於女皇與皇娘不無微辭，總算英國皇大爲懷，不加禁止，而讀者得有人類不會或無的缺點而傳中人活龍活現倍覺可親。中國人的傳人則不然，唯恐被傳者有一絲一毫小毛病露出來以致不像廟裏的菩薩。在這種條件之下，寫自傳固然難於動筆，傳人也只好束手了。</p>
<p>比傳記規模要小得多，被傳者不一定要名公巨卿的，還有人物誌。這類作品美國雜誌似乎特別多，或記一個黑人兒子怎樣苦讀學成，或述一個鄕下醫生如何樂於施診，或叙八十歲老太太怎樣與人方便，或誌一個殘廢者如何努力克服眼睛脚蹺的困難，令人讀了覺得做人應該奮發樂觀，不必老是唉聲歎氣，一死方快。這種無名人物中國總還有的是，即使寫得不敬了幾句，如說此人坐相不正立相不穩之類，也不至受處分吃苦頭，我想我們大可效尤一番，使陰慘慘的中國文風雜一點生氣。不知高明以爲然否？</p>
<h3>勝訴奇計</h3>
<p>— 希禮</p>
<p>原吿律師在一件汽車肇事案裏舉出了一個證人，並稱他曾在肇事後的片刻看見被告已撞壞汽車上的速度表正指着每小時七十五哩的違章速度。</p>
<p>當證人被帶上法庭之後，被吿的辯護律師問道。「你吸香烟嗎？</p>
<p>「晤—吸的。」驚詫的證人回答道。他不知被吿律師要問這個話是什麽意思。</p>
<p>「駱駝牌？」律師再問。</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「好，現在請你吿訴庭上，駱駝牌香烟盒子的那個牽駱駝的人有沒有戴帽子。」</p>
<p>「戴的。」很快的回答稱。</p>
<p>被吿律師從口袋裏取出一包駱駝牌來遞給那個證人。</p>
<p>「我知道你是一個誠實的人，」他然後說道，「並且你不會無緣無故地說謊話。像這個香烟盒子，它上面根本沒有牽駱駝的人，但是我問你這人戴不戴帽子之後，你就當眞有這麽一個人了。這件案子也是如此。原吿律師說你曾看見表上的針指着一小時七十五哩的速度——我的事主是加以否認的，你的腦子裏就產生同樣的一個印象，好像你的確看見你其實沒有看見的事情了。」</p>
<p>被吿終於勝訴了。</p>
<h3>裁減不得</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>好容易，公教人負的待遇才調整了一次。</p>
<p>這裏所說的調整，實在是包含着二重涵義，並不是一般習慣上所謂調整即是加價的別名而已，因爲這次公敎人員薪金的調整，雖然經過什麽會什麽院什麼部的幾次三番討論硏究，但其結果是底薪愈小的吃虧愈大，底薪愈大的加的愈多，而在一百元底薪以下的，則不但沒有加過一分半臺），反而打上一個七折八扣。公用事業日用百物每調整一次，漲上五成一倍，惟有公敎人員的待遇却給調整得較前益發减少了。</p>
<p>從表面看，指數似乎大了些，然而實物配給减少，差額金降低，歸根結底，還是個明昇暗降，以進爲退，可憐的公敎人員，又吃了一次空心湯　！如果說是明令减薪那倒也罷，不幸的是不知眞相的總以爲是加了薪水，又那裏會想到其他呢？</p>
<p>但今年似乎是「公敎人員倒楣年」，暗中吃了這次調整虧不算，消息傳來，政府的本年度施政綱領中，列入了裁員簡政的一條，各機關將要緊縮組織，準備裁汰冗員百分之二十五。這個問題可嚴重了，因爲薪給調整，究竟還是吃得飽吃不飽的間題，而裁汰人員，却是飯有得吃沒得吃的問題。百分之二十五不是一個小數目，這些被裁汰下來的人員往那麥去找事做，不知道有誰給想到過沒有？假使想到了，除了讓其自生自滅外，不知道有沒有行得通的辦法沒有？</p>
<p>誰到今日的機關辦公處來看一看，誰都會覺着今天的確有許多冗員要裁，因爲可以驚奇的是各機關似乎多的是空着手在辦公室看小報哼小調的「公務人員」。這批冗員不裁，當然是徒耗國府支出，徒重人民負祖，但是這批冗員們却又大都是別人動得他動不得的老爺們。一旦裁起員來，不要說是百分之二十五，即是裁去百分之七十五，也栽不到他們的頭上，而犧牲在裁員令下的，却正是各機關埋首苦幹的份子，他們無依無靠，當然首當其衝，是必然列入被裁之列的。樣這，把機關裏的中堅份子統趕跑了，行政効率一定會驟然降低，降低到出乎意料之外的地步。</p>
<p>减薪是已經减了的了，裁員恐怕也是非裁不可，現在再來說裁减不得，當然效果極小。但是裁减的結果，最先受影響的當然是被裁的這一羣，而間接直接地影響到整個行政効率，最後結果還是辦不了，忽然想到舞業職工因爲禁舞而起的糾紛，又不禁混身起了一陣冷戰。</p>
<h3>幾首有懷散木叔範白蕉諸子海上</h3>

<h3>豆腐與豬肉</h3>
<p>— 廣覺</p>
<p>妻子從小菜塲裏回來向我不斷提出的平淡的報吿當中，有兩件是稍爲有些意思的。</p>
<p>第一，她要我猜，過年的時候，樣樣東西生意好，只有一樣比平時還壞，這是什麽？我猜不出，原來這是豆腐。豆腐是素的，物美價廉，平時吃得太多，過年過節應該把它疎一疎了；再加，新年新歲樣要討個彩，這東西却好像有一點象徵了不吉利的意思，在弔齋中總歸有它，弔齋也就呌豆腐飯，除了它的白顏色，不知道還有什麼別的原故，研究民俗學的人應該說得出的。</p>
<p>第二，她吿訴我，隔壁裁縫店老板娘到火車站附近去買了一夾猪肉來，價錢比小菜塲上要便宜一半，買到家裏，洗之再三，看看聞聞，總是放心不下，恐怕不新鮮，甚至疑心是死猪。妻子的意思，難得吃肉，過年過節，何必爲了省一點錢，自討鬱塞；我則以爲正因爲難得吃肉，過年過節才想多吃些肉，還是最好省一點錢，明怕貨色拿不住，不得已去買便宜貨，從這‘一點小事倒是寫得出苦難的民生的。不過我敎她去對裁縫店老板娘說，這幾天的單帮客人，只是趕節令，便宜是便宜在屠宰稅和肉販肉店的利潤上，肉準是一樣好的，可以放心吃。</p>
<p>人總是怕自己受了別人的欺詐，其實，別人也只是爲了生活，而且到底不是都靠欺詐生活的。大家生活得容易些，這種不愉快的情緒就可以消滅了。</p>
<h3>賽跑</h3>
<p>— 無咎</p>
<p>美國坎薩斯州立大學的宿舍裏，突然闖進了一個小賊，他偸偸開了冰箱，把冰箱裏貯藏的食物大嚼一頓，吃飽之後，還一手挨了一只鷄，另一只手裏拿了二磅魚。但在他　想溜走的時候，突然給學生們發覺，於是這些靑年們就飛奔追趕，不想追了半英里之後，竟然仍舊沒有追到。</p>
<p>學生們並不介意這些食物，他們所感到沮喪的倒是竟然會追不到那個鴻飛冥其的樑上君子。而學生們之中有一個人却比別人更特別的感到沮喪，他的名字呌做雷亞迪——是全美國大名鼎鼎的長跑健將！</p>
<h3>超山談梅</h3>
<p>— 棠溪</p>
<p>春到人間，一年一度之超山探梅團，又忙於準備，遊超山者，多以一覩宋梅爲快。其實超山梅花之勝，以其環迴十里，香雪如海，故賞梅者當環山徐步，以龍洞乾元道觀爲終點，始克領略眞趣，至所謂宋梅，疑好事者從別處移植於此，遂以宋宮故物爲號召，無徵不信，况此梅因戰時失於調護，半株已枯槁，僅餘半株椅石着花，想不久亦將析而爲薪。附近大明堂（報慈寺），寺旣不閎，僧亦俚陋，香海樓頭，供憇息　飲之塲則可，若鶴林梵宮之勝，無足稱焉。觀里人姚某詩「六墓冬靑址渺茫，緣何百刦賸孤芳？不關信史花原好，豈藉虛名景自彰！閱歷滄桑多剝復，送迎冠蓋笑炎凉，劇憐傲骨嶙嶒甚，勤與山僧博稻梁！」寫實甚謔，故並誌之。</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十章　自願犧牲　七六</p>
<p>小王媽啐了一口道：「別瞎說了，誰信你的話！」渚　道：一眞的，我在頭一次見你，腦筋裏就有一個好印象。」小王媽道：「有什麼好印象？」渚齋道：「我一見你，便知道你聰明伶俐，而且是一個很溫柔很多情的女孩子。」小王媽連連搖頭道：「別說，別說，我不配！我是一個粗人，是鄉下姑娘，什麽溫柔多情，這話只好對老板說好了！」渚齋道：「那末，我不用拿許多字眼來形容你，只說你這人好，有良心，你不能不承認吧！」小王媽點點頭道：「這個誰都該如此。老板平日注重的就是人能誠實。老板在許多朋友裏面，注意徐先生，也爲的徐先生這人誠實，徐先生說的話，都是可靠，她常對我這樣說。」渚齋聽了嘆一口氣道：「她，現在上那裏去了？」小王媽道：「不會不回來，總是給那一位朋友留住。天快亮了，你睡吧」說着微微一笑。渚齋才把手縮回被內，閉上眼睛，心裏亂雜雜的，那能睡得着！不時偸偸開眼睛一看，見小王媽一邊用手按摩，一雙眼睛仍注在他臉上，毫無一點倦容。每見渚齋睜開眼睛，便對他微微一笑，渚齋此時一心中只注意綺紈，對於小王媽，太有落花有意，流水無情之慨，照樣閉着眼，迷迷糊糊。在似睡非睡間，忽然給一陣淸脆的電鈴驚醒，小王媽早一骨碌下來，穿上鞋，出去開門，過了一會才進來，　齋早大聲喊着問題道：「是老板回來了嗎？」連問了兩聲，不見小王媽答應。</p>
<h3>山本五十六之死</h3>
<p>— 達人譯</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭中有一件非常特別的事，發生在所羅門羣島，當時美軍正在準備進攻新喬治亞。</p>
<p>四月十七日，有一個最機密的情報傳達給所羅門羣島的美國空軍司令，詳述日本聯合艦隊司令長官山本五十六大將當時視察南太平洋和西南太平洋日軍基地的日程。據這情報說，山本定於明晨從拉巴爾（Rabaul）出發，　　是一架「培蒂」　（三菱式零一型雙引擎　炸機），他的幕僚則乘另一架同式的飛機，而由六架零式戰鬥機嚴密護行。這八架飛機預定於當地時間上午九時四十五分在加里（Kahili）機塲降陸。指令上要該管地區的美軍司令以「最大的努力」，擊毁山本。指令上簽字的是海長諾克斯。</p>
<p>距加里機塲最近的聯軍空軍基地是羅塞爾羣島上新築的拜尼加機塲，但拜尼加機塲上並沒有長距離的戰鬥機，而襲擊山本這一命令則指定了暫時停在漢特遜機塲的美國陸軍P三八型閃電式機隊去執行，該隊的指揮官是密契爾少校（John　W．Mitchell）。</p>
<p>即使帶足汽油，這些飛機的續　力也祗有五百哩，但從漢特　機塲到加里機塲，就是美最近的路綫也要三百哩，但當時所羅門羣島的中部由日軍佔領，美國飛行員所欲採取的是繞道所　門羣島中部之西南的一條弧綫，因爲怕被敵軍的雷達站所偵悉，可是這一綫便有四百哩之遙。因此要在加里機塲附近襲擊山本，餘裕的時間便很少了。由於密契爾少校和蘭斐爾上尉（Thomas　G．Lanphier　Jr．）的建議，決定試圖在加里機塲西北三十五呱的所在襲擊山本。</p>
<p>那時考慮不週，在漢特遜機塲不曾保守秘密，竟有大批眾官和士兵都知道此行的目的。這事後來很使指揮部方而感到尷尬。</p>
<p>可以參加二這次征程的有十八架閃電式機，米契爾少校指定四架擔任攻擊，由蘭斐爾上尉指揮，他自己指揮十四架飛機，作强有力的掩護。日本偸襲珍珠港時，山本正在役，而且吹過牛，要在白宮口授和平條件，因此爲美國人所痛恨。那時預料山本的飛機一到加里機塲，當地的日本空軍司令總會出動一百多架飛機來歡迎。</p>
<p>蘭斐爾上尉手下的四架飛機，有一架在跑道上軋破了輸胎，不曾起飛，還有一架機件發生障礙，也不曾飛起來，於是密契爾少校便另派兩架飛機補充，只剩下十二架飛機擔任掩護。</p>
<p>在飛到玻根維爾島（Bougainviele）的時候，飛行低掠海面（「平頂帽式飛行」），時連兩百五十哩，平安無事。在預定襲擊時間以前五分鐘，美機高昇空中，蘭斐爾手下的昇至一萬呎，密契爾手下的昇至兩一萬呎。九點三十三分飛過玻根維爾海岸。</p>
<p>此次襲擊成功，幾乎全靠對山本的佔計時間佔計得不錯。不幸，山本有嚴守時刻的習慣，美國的情報員熟知道一點，已經通知了美機機員。結果據美方估計，山本早到一分鐘。在九點三十四分，敵方　炸機兩架利零式戰鬥機六架來了。預料中的大批日機迎接却並沒有實現。</p>
<p>敵方領頭的零式戰鬥機直向闌斐爾上尉撲來，蘭斐爾便擊落了它，這時山本及其幕僚的兩架廛機便向下急降，幾及樹頂。蘭斐爾跟着急降，設法襲擊領頭的一架，同時還得逃避敵方兩架零式戰鬥機的攻擊。據　斐爾自己佔計，他降落到距樹頂十呎光景，便與山本庫機的飛行綫成直角，他便開火，作遠程射擊。山本座機的右引擎和右翼都着了火，墮入叢林，燒毁了。（據後來日方報吿，山本死在座位上，兩滕中間的軍刀依然豎着。）巴勃中尉（Rex　Barber）以同樣的方式避免三架零式機的攻擊，擊落了山本幕僚的座機。美方唯一的損失便是亨恩中尉（Raymond　M．Hine）駕使的一架，他跟襲擊巴勃中尉的三架零式機混戰一回之後，只見他的飛機掉了下來，尾巴拖着烟，此後便不再聽到亨恩的消息。</p>
<p>瓜島（Guadalcanal）的美軍基地大舉慶祝，這好消息曾刋載於美國空軍的新聞簡報上。美方預知山本坐這一架飛機這一點，後來美方深恐爲日方所察破，因爲日方如果察破這一點，那末他們便能探索到這情報的來源。可是日方始終總爲山本座機，只不過是彼美方偶然擊毀而已，並非有意製擊，雖然他們也略有疑惑。</p>
<p>其實這內幕是很簡單的：美國海軍情報常局早在此事發生的一年以前，「打破」了日本海軍的密碼。而預知山本的行程則得之於截收日方的無綫電訊。（譯自Gilbert　Cant「太平洋大　」）</p>

<h3>Ma Qing Testifies in the House of Representatives Hearing, Requesting Congress to Allocate Funds to Aid China to Establish a Stable Economic Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 20th (Radio Dispatch), Washington: Secretary of State Marshall attended a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 20th, requesting that Congress allocate $570 million in aid to China so that the country could have "time to breathe" to take steps to stabilize its economic situation. However, Secretary Marshall stated, "The United States cannot, therefore, assume direct responsibility for the work of the Chinese government and its political, economic, and military affairs. Regarding the aid-to-China plan, it should be recognized that the main solution to China's problems depends largely on the Chinese themselves." He pointed out that the main factor hindering the resolution of China's economic problems was the civil war, and further stated, "The civil war has depleted China's foreign exchange reserves at home and abroad, continuously destroyed property and economic life, and hindered recovery. The Communist army has caused terrible damage to disrupt China's economy, as it is the Communist Party's intention to force China's economy to collapse." He stated: China's current situation makes an effective long-term economic recovery plan impossible. However, Secretary Marshall also stated: The United States should provide aid to China to help delay the rapid decline of the Chinese economy, so that China can have time to breathe, and then begin to establish a more stable economic situation. The United States cannot currently consider providing China with similar assistance to the European recovery plan. For example, in terms of providing a currency stabilization fund, according to the opinions of currency experts, the amount required is very large, and under China's current situation, most of the results will be lost. He stated: Before the establishment of a foreign aid organization, the State Department will temporarily be responsible for the work. Secretary Marshall did not mention military aid to China, which is expected to arouse opposition from the Republican Party. After Secretary Marshall presented his views, Chairman Eaton of the committee immediately expressed his opinion, making an analogy to the government's proposed aid-to-China plan, believing that "the gun muzzle is too large, and the bullet is too small."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th (United Press Dispatch)] Congressman Zhou Yide, who is leading the congressional initiative to aid China, recently stated: The government's $570 million aid-to-China plan is fundamentally flawed in terms of military affairs. He advocated providing Chairman Chiang with military aid of the same nature as aid to Greece. He stated: Unless China can win its war against the Communists, I do not believe that this economic plan can have any effect. Only by winning the war against the Communists can the economic depletion and chaos caused by the war in China be contained. Zhou did not want to express his views on the amount of money, but stated: I have always stated that assisting China in the following matters is necessary: (1) Moral support. The President's aid-to-China proposal has already achieved this. (2) Military assistance, including arms and ammunition, and authorizing our military advisory group in China to provide more assistance to China in all aspects, just as the military delegation stationed in Greece did. (3) Financial assistance, so that China can make up for its balance of payments deficit. This only requires lending $20 million per month. (4) Assist in stabilizing its currency, preferably by providing 150 to 200 million US dollars in silver. (5) Invest in special projects, such as railways, shipping, power plants, textile factories, and fertilizer plants. Once China's military situation stabilizes, private investment will flow into China.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Our Foreign Exchange Market, Bei Zuyi Will Submit a Plan to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Well-informed sources reported on the 19th that Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese economic and technical mission here, hopes to submit to the United States government in the next few days a plan drafted by China to use American aid to stabilize the foreign exchange market in Shanghai. The sources said: Being able to adopt this special way of handling the problem, Nanjing has announced that it will request three to five hundred million yuan from the United States to achieve some kind of stability. The plan to be submitted by Bei requires the United States to fund the Shanghai Chinese government foreign exchange stabilization committee with a maximum amount of 500 million yuan. The committee will control all foreign exchange transactions. The Chinese reason is that if the foreign exchange committee has this amount of money, it will be able to maintain the exchange rate on a regular basis. Financial experts believe that if the Chinese government can maintain the exchange rate on a regular basis, the efficiency of its necessary plans will be greatly enhanced. Some experts believe that part of the 500 million yuan fund may be used to increase the purchase of goods stipulated in the 570 million US aid-to-China plan. It is pointed out that 510 million yuan in the aid-to-China plan is earmarked for "import of essential goods," which is exactly the latest figure for China during the validity period of the aid-to-China plan. It is generally believed that if more funds can be raised for this purpose, some shortages can be alleviated. The reason is that balancing foreign exchange enables the government to have greater control over import efficiency. At the same time, supplementing the import of essential goods exceeding the plan may establish a basis for stabilizing the domestic goods situation in China. It is generally believed that this is a prerequisite for reforming the currency system. In the past few weeks, Bei Zuyi has explained the contents of Zhang Qun's ten-point financial and economic improvement plan to American officials "item by item." As of today, Bei has explained seven of them in detail, but the fifth point is uniquely absent. According to that point, it is related to "establishing a basis for a stable currency system." What Bei plans to submit in the short term is the "clarification" of the fifth point. It is expected that its content will include a plan to stabilize the foreign exchange market, and it may also be a strategy with other indirect solutions to the currency problem. Chinese officials have made it clear that they are not currently interested in reforming the currency system with a silver standard.</p>
<h3>This Year's Loan Plan, The Four Joint Council Will Discuss and Decide Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Four Joint Council will hold its first meeting of this year at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th. The meeting will be presided over by Zhang Qun, vice chairman of the council. All directors and persons in charge of the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury will participate. This year's loan plan can be discussed and decided at the meeting, but it can only be implemented after Chairman Chiang's final approval. It has been decided that agricultural loans will be opened first, but the date of opening has not yet been determined. Because the suspension of loans was Chairman Chiang's handwritten order, the date of opening will also wait for the Chairman to decide. The loan plan formulated by the Four Joint Headquarters is still divided into two parts: agricultural loans and industrial and mining loans. Each has its own annual guidelines and plans, but the amount of industrial and mining loans has not been pre-determined. As of the 20th, all of the plans for this year's loans from the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury have been sent to the Four Joint Headquarters. The Ministry of Economic Affairs had previously submitted three opinions to the Executive Yuan on opening up loans, advocating that loans should be opened before the Spring Festival, but it was not adopted. This time, the Four Joint Council will hold a meeting, and Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian specially ordered the Industrial Department to draft opinions on industrial loans, which were drafted by Gu Baochang, director of the department, and presented to Chen on the evening of the 19th. These opinions will also be presented at the Four Joint Council meeting on the 21st. It is said that the main idea is to advocate that industrial loans should be restored as soon as possible to promote production. Regarding the loan method, it is advocated that it should be different depending on the industry, and there is no need to fix a certain method. Moreover, the area where industrial loans are handled should be treated equally throughout the country, and should not be biased towards a certain region. It is also advocated that there should be an overall plan.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Expresses Excitement About US Aid to China in His Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng made a statement to reporters on the 20th regarding the US President's proposal to aid China. President Truman's proposal to aid China is indeed exciting news. Wu also emphasized that what we Chinese deeply admire is not only the US President's proposal to aid China and the amount of aid, but also his deep understanding of the difficulties currently encountered by the Chinese people. Wu continued: We need foreign aid to restore our country's war wounds and all the current destruction of the Communist Party, just as European countries today urgently need foreign aid. Therefore, we hope that President Truman's aid-to-China bill will be passed by the US Congress as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Four American Ships, Transporting Rice to China</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 19th] Four ships carrying more than 12,400 long tons of rice are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai between March 1 and March 25.

<h3>Foreign and Overseas Chinese Investors Flock to Invest in Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Initial Phase May Exceed US$50 Million</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] According to the person in charge of the Engineering Guidance Office in Guangzhou: As southern China is becoming increasingly prosperous, foreign and overseas Chinese investors are very interested in investing and setting up factories in Guangdong. Following the American Pan Yi Company, there are now more than a dozen foreign investors and many overseas Chinese who are actively discussing registration and proceeding with setting up factories. It is also learned that if the situation permits, the initial investment by foreign investors in southern China is estimated to reach more than US$50 million, equivalent to more than 90 trillion Chinese currency. The investment targets will focus on light industries such as textiles, glass, and beverages.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 20th] Guangzhou News: The Guangdong authorities expect that factories will move south, and foreign capital will follow Truman's request for 60 million to promote the industrial development of southern China, pouring into Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>According to reports: Ten factories in Shanghai and Tianjin have applied to Nanjing for permission to move to Guangdong. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Government has received inquiries from all parties regarding this move. American Pan Yi Company is planning to build several factories and enterprises in southern China, which are scheduled to start construction this summer. Pan Yi, the manager of the company, returned to the United States last year to arrange for increasing capital and purchasing raw materials. The initial business plan formulated by Pan Yi Company includes three points: First, develop the coal mines in Guangdong. Second, revive the Yuehan Railway. Third, build Huangpu into a deep-water port.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Chairman Song Ziwen returned to Beijing to request more funds. As for Song's plan to go to the United States, it has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>The Whereabouts of the Ancient Bell of Hanshan Temple</h3>
<p>The Allied Headquarters Ordered the Japanese Government to Investigate and Report</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Allied Headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to return the Chinese auxiliary currency it had looted to China, and to report the whereabouts of the ancient bell in Hanshan Temple, Suzhou, to the Allied Headquarters before March 20. According to reports, this ancient bell was taken to Japan by Marquis Okuma Shigenobu in 1940. It is a relic of the Tang Dynasty and is priceless.</p>
<h3>Grain Rationing System in Five Cities, Implemented in Beijing and Shanghai Starting Next Month, Guangzhou Starting on March 15, and Pingjin Starting on April 1</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The meeting on grain rationing in five cities was very successful, and the mayors of the five cities were able to take advantage of the meeting to discuss various requests with the relevant departments. Among them, the greatest achievements were made by the cities of Pingjin, because the grain sources required by the cities of Pingjin in the rationing system have been negotiated with the Ministry of Food, and at the same time, the Ministry of Food has approved that in the four months of implementing the rationing in the future, the Ministry of Food will still transport 500,000 bags of flour and 30,000 dans of rice to the north every month according to the past practice of allocation, in order to adjust the grain market in Pingjin and further revitalize the demand for people's food in North China. In addition, the amount of grain rationed in the five cities, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Food, is one dou per person in each city, and two dou in Shanghai. One dou of which is rice that can be purchased at the market price with a purchase certificate, the purpose of which is to restrict and prevent grain merchants from hoarding, and at the same time to control market fluctuations, which has nothing to do with rationing. As for the fact that other cities have not handled it at the same time, it is because the localities do not have this need. The spokesman also told reporters in a very optimistic tone that the grain sources for rationing, whether in Pingjin or Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, have been fully prepared and are not in short supply. As for the representatives who have not yet left Beijing, they are negotiating some related issues, such as transportation and funds for purchasing grain. Once the Ministry of Finance has approved the allocation of funds, they can return to their posts and actively prepare for rationing. In addition, the implementation period of the rationing system in the five cities is slightly different. The exact dates are as follows: Beijing and Shanghai will start on March 1, Guangzhou will start on March 15, and Pingjin will start on April 1. In addition, the general rules for food rationing in the five cities discussed and passed by the rationing meeting will be announced and implemented after approval.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Police Conference Opens</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoliang Emphasizes the Strength of the People, and Reviews Mao's Bandit's "Three Requests Policy"</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] The Chongqing Police Conference was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th in the auditorium of the headquarters.

Xiao Yisu reported in the afternoon on the implementation plan for the organization and training of the people in the counties of the police district, which he had formulated. The main content is to target the conspiracies of the Communist bandits, first eliminate the internal bandits, and at the same time prepare to eliminate the external bandits who have fled here, so that the internal bandits have no place to stay, and the external bandits cannot invade. In addition, establish self-defense meetings in townships, districts, and towns, and organize various task forces that do not deviate from production. In order to ensure that the foundation of the people's self-defense is solid, the four self-policies of self-purification, self-defense, self-governance, and self-enrichment are implemented in parallel. This meeting was simple and solemn. The meeting place did not provide cigarettes and meals, but only clear tea was served.</p>

<h3>The Inside Story of the Communist Bandits in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Various Institutions Adopt a Decentralized Approach</p>
<p>[United Press, this city] A person who is absolutely reliable lived behind the iron curtain in the Northeast for a year and a half and has now returned to Shanghai. He informed us of the situation in the Northeast as follows: The CCP learned a lesson from the Battle of Yan'an and realized the harm of concentrating administrative institutions. Therefore, it adopted a decentralized approach in the Northeast. Its active bases are currently distributed in an arc shape, from Harbin to the east and north, directly pointing to the Soviet border. The CCP concentrated its political headquarters in Jiayuli. The main artillery training center of the Communist Party is in Mudanjiang, 85 miles east of the Soviet Union and only 175 miles from Vladivostok. The Air Force school is located in Linkou, and the Soviet border is 50 miles to the north. (Continued on page 2, column 3)</p>
<h3>British Embassy Statement: No Evacuation Notice Issued</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The British Embassy has denied rumors that it had issued an evacuation order for British nationals north of the Yangtze River. According to a statement issued by the embassy, in order to minimize the number of British nationals residing in potentially dangerous areas, the British Ambassador has authorized British consulates in North China to advise British nationals residing in any areas where danger or famine appears imminent to evacuate as appropriate. However, no registration for the purpose of evacuation has ever been organized for British nationals north of the Yangtze River or in other areas. The British Embassy has not, in fact, issued such a notice. The British Embassy's concern is solely to prevent British nationals from encountering difficulties as a result of possible unfortunate developments and traffic disruptions.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Currency</h3>
<p>Forced into Circulation in Communist Areas</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 20th] Military News: Communist bandits have recently been forcibly circulating military currency printed by the Soviet Union in 1945 in "liberated areas." The denominations are ten, fifty, and one hundred yuan, with each yuan forcibly exchanged for 10,000 legal tender yuan. The currency is light brown in color, with blue patterned designs, and bears the Chinese characters "Issued by the Headquarters of the Soviet Red Army, all expenditures must use this currency." The reverse side is printed with the words "Counterfeiters and those who refuse to use this currency will be punished by military law" and "1945." According to reports, it is now widely circulating in northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters Plans Thorough Training of the Populace</h3>
<p>First Train Local Cadres</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 20th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters plans to thoroughly train the populace within six months to provide a foundation for military operations. The Hebei Provincial Government is cooperating with this plan and has decided to start by training local work cadres. Training corps will be established in Pingbao to accommodate as many progressive elements from among the refugees as possible. After training, they will return to their hometowns to cooperate with the military. At the same time, new policies will be implemented in eastern Hebei, including the "Three-Three Rent Reduction" and land policies. This work will be undertaken by trainees from the Central Training Corps who have just completed their training in Beijing, starting with individual counties. All cadres will be selected from these corps members in order to achieve uniformity. There are more than ninety members in Hebei Province. They will gather in Tangshan on the 21st, only 79 days after leaving Tomsk, which is located south of the Soviet border.</p>
<h3>Anshan City Engulfed in Flames: National Army Fights Bitterly, Making Bandits Pay the Price for Every Bunker; Our Country's Heavy Industry Unfortunately Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] Heavy snow fell on the 20th, hindering air force operations. According to military authorities, the Anshan garrison held the Tiexi Steel Plant on the 19th, killing many bandits. Contact with them was lost that night. The number of bandits attacking Anshan reached 50,000 to 60,000, and the garrison, with a force several times smaller, held out heroically for a week. The North Shahe Railway Bridge in Anshan and another two strongholds are being defended by the National Army. Furthermore, bandits who had gathered in the Kaiyuan area north of Shenyang reportedly ambushed National Army troops who were being transferred, but were repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] Fierce street fighting has broken out in Anshan City. By the afternoon of the 19th, the entire city was engulfed in flames under a barrage of artillery fire. The Communist bandits launched repeated fierce attacks, and the National Army defended their strongholds, forcing the Communist bandits to pay a heavy price for every bunker. The fighting was particularly intense on both the east and west sides of the train station and in the city center. The National Army is still holding the Steel Company, continuing to inflict heavy casualties on the bandits. [Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was one of the most successful in the Northeast in terms of post-war recovery and is a key component of China's heavy industry. If it unfortunately falls into the hands of the bandits, it will inevitably be destroyed beforehand, and the loss will be difficult to quantify. The world will lament this. The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant is the second largest in East Asia, second only to the Yawata Iron Works in Japan, with an annual production capacity of 800,000 tons of steel and 1.5 million tons of pig iron. It is known as the "Iron Capital." It was taken over in June 1946, and the iron and steel plant and its affiliated units were gradually established in October of the same year. Steel production began in mid-January 1947. The budget for the resumption of work required US$10 million, with an annual value of US$30 million. The National Resources Commission decided to prioritize the revival of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in its heavy industry development plans, supplying hardware and equipment to North and Central China, saving more than US$100 million in foreign exchange each year. The first phase of the plant's restoration plan called for an annual output of 200,000 tons, reaching one million tons in five years. The first phase of steelmaking involved the restoration of one 600-ton mixer, two 300-ton refining furnaces, four 100-ton furnaces, and eight gas furnaces. Under the guidance of Shao Yizhou, the plant was painstakingly managed. The steelmaking furnace was put into operation on August 6th of last year. More than 30 factories, including coking, steelmaking, steel rolling, casting, steel pipe, steel rope, rail, and bridge factories, were successively put into operation, flourishing and growing. Until the time of this writing, steel ingot production had increased to more than 1,600 tons. Unfortunately, the conflict resumed in October, transportation was interrupted, and work came to a standstill, resulting in the failure of ironmaking efforts. According to regulations, the iron and steel plant's resumption process involved first producing rolled products, then flat steel, and then pig iron, using semi-finished products (such as steel ingots and large and small steel billets) stored in the factory to maintain production during the transition period. Last year, 70,000 tons of rolled products were produced, with about 10,000 tons being exported, including small steel products, steel sheets, wires, and medium-sized steel plates and tubes.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Several Issues Concerning Rationing</h3>
<p>When the Sino-American Relief Agreement was signed and announced by the governments of the two countries on October 27th of last year, this newspaper published an article advocating the implementation of comprehensive rationing in this city, with the grain item allocated for rationing materials and half of the cost borne by our country to match the contribution. Now, the central government has decided to implement rationing simultaneously in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which is generally consistent with our proposal. The grain rationing conference convened by the Ministry of Food has also been held in Nanjing in recent days, and decisions have been made regarding all rationing plans. The "General Rules for the Implementation of Grain Rationing in the Five Cities" that were passed will also be implemented. This is a very important matter. We would like to raise several issues regarding the method for the reference of the competent authorities.</p>
<p>(1) How to Prepare: The central competent departments and the five major cities have all made considerable plans in advance. This city has a solid foundation, and both the outline of the rationing and the detailed rules for implementation have been drafted separately before being submitted to the central government for discussion. We believe that the outcome of the grain rationing conference will be quite comprehensive. However, comprehensive rationing is still a first for our country, and the technology is very complex. In order to ensure the accuracy of time, quantity, and price, all issues related to sources, transportation, storage, distribution, investigation, certification, and consignment sales must be carefully arranged and coordinated. Therefore, the preparations must be sufficient, and the allocation of agencies, funds, and personnel must be complete. It cannot be too hasty due to time constraints, nor can it be too simple for the sake of saving money. The past administrative practices of rushing things through and simplifying things in order to save money are not suitable for rationing. This is a scientific work that affects the interests of every citizen, especially in terms of international perception. What is the efficiency of our administration? This requires a factual answer. What is the key?</p>
<p>(2) How to Cooperate: Even if the method is very thorough, it will be useless if it is not implemented effectively or if the people do not abide by the law. Based on what has been shown by various facts in the past, we hope that: (1) The investigation must be accurate, and the verification must be strict, and all abuses such as duplication, accommodation, and fraud must be eliminated; (2) Therefore, in terms of citizens, the movement of household registration and the application for national identity cards also require the greatest attention. Although the household registration has been checked, the household registration may not be very clear, especially in the case of identity cards; not everyone may have them. This cannot be entirely blamed on the autonomous organizations, because citizens may be too negligent about such procedures.</p>
<p>(3) How to Prevent Abuses: The so-called abuses, in addition to the duplication and fraud mentioned above, also include the following that we have heard of: (1) Not being able to receive ration coupons; (2) Requiring fulfillment of certain conditions when receiving coupons; (3) Not being able to buy goods even after receiving coupons; (4) Goods being too bad; (5) Insufficient quantity; (6) In certain areas, we have heard that the rationing amount is distributed separately, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the government's prescribed rationing amount for each person; (7) Selling the rationed goods at market prices and using the profits (price difference) for public use, without prior permission from the authorities; (8) The handling agency may even have a portion of the remaining ration coupons that can be distributed monthly, as if distributing bonuses. These abuses are certainly not universal, but they are not non-existent either. Articles 17 to 20 of the detailed rules for implementation drafted by this city this time have expressly prohibited the above items 1 to 5, and it has not been touched upon how to prevent items 6, 7, and 8. Measures should be supplemented and strictly prohibited to improve the credibility of the rationing policy and increase the trust of citizens.</p>
<p>(4) How to Determine Price and Quantity: Rationing has three conditions, namely, fixed time, fixed quantity, and fixed price. Without these, it is not enough to achieve the goal of stabilizing grain prices and stabilizing society. Regarding the price, how it will be determined has not been announced as of this writing. According to the capital's forecast, it is planned to be 5% lower than the market price, which does not seem to meet general expectations. Because in the past, the rationing price in this city was only 240,000 yuan per dan, and it will be adjusted from this month, but it will not exceed 800,000 yuan per dan. If it is sold at the price set by the ministry, the difference would be too great. Moreover, adjusting it monthly is tantamount to following the black market, which is inconsistent with the purpose of suppressing rice prices. Food Minister Yu said in a firm tone: "I believe that grain prices can be suppressed to a considerable extent after the implementation of the rationing system." (See this newspaper on the 16th) We believe that the rationing, which is 5% lower than the market price, is not welcomed by the general public.</p>
<p>As for the quantity, it is planned that small households will receive one dou per month for complete rationing, and large households will receive two dou, half of which will be rationed and half of which will be purchased, called rationed rice and permitted rice. This is indeed a last resort before the source of grain is smooth and this material cannot be fully grasped. Moreover, if this is done, rice merchants can still operate, which will not lead to serious problems such as unemployment, and it can be said that both sides are taken care of. What can be studied is that each person's permitted rice must also be purchased with a certificate, and it is not allowed to exceed the limit. Although this is said to prevent hoarding, but the government has not been able to fully supply the people with rice, and the rationing period is currently only tentatively set for four months, and it has not been confirmed whether it can be extended. Whether this restriction is necessary seems to be a question. Because individual households' storage of rice for personal use is different from large-scale hoarding, and the provision of the right to purchase rice can also slightly reduce the government's burden. For example, large companies and factories often have their own reserves of rice for their employees, so there is no difficulty in whether the rationed rice is sufficient or whether there is a delay. In our view, if the government must strictly implement this restriction, then the extension of the rationing period and the expansion of the rationing amount (that is, the two dou of rice per month for large households must be fully rationed) must be continuously worked hard and promoted to achieve it as soon as possible. As the ancients said, "If you have a plan, do not abandon it." Since it has been done, we always hope to continue to do it. It must not be done suddenly and then stopped suddenly, so as not to lose the government's prestige. We especially hope to find ways to expand it, and truly do it in a good way, so that citizens can truly trust the supply of food and other daily necessities, and there is no need to save separately, then the trend of individual households hoarding will naturally stop, and prices can be stabilized to satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the current rationing period is temporarily set at four months, that is, assuming from March to the end of June of this year. The reason for this is of course that the number of food items under the US relief program is limited and does not allow for long-term rationing. However, as far as we know, there is no way to supplement them in the future. For example: (1) The proceeds from the sale of US materials can still be used to purchase food, according to Article 3, Paragraph C of the Sino-American Agreement. (2) The loan of US$180 million approved by the US Congress last year will also be provided in the form of material assistance. These are all plans from foreign aid. If the rationing price is set at 5% lower than the market price, then the loss is minimal, and it is not difficult to find a way to subsidize the rice.</p>
<p>In short, the main point of this grain rationing conference is grain, but its impact affects the entire rationing issue. Because grain is the center of rationing, if grain is rationed well, the supply of other daily necessities such as oil, salt, sugar, cloth, and fuel will also be handled well. Therefore, this conference is of great importance. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, we also hope that it will broaden its scope and send personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Resources Commission to participate, so that there will also be opportunities to improve the rationing of other daily necessities. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, "US Aid and Self-Help," contained the sentence "President Truman proposed to allocate US$570 million to aid China within eight years." "Eight years" is a mistake for "one year." This is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3>Is the Japanese Emperor Responsible for War Crimes? Our Side Pays Close Attention; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Does Not Comment</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 20th] After the news that the Tokyo Far East International Military Tribunal's Prosecutor's Office issued a general indictment against Japanese war criminals stating that the Japanese Emperor was not responsible for war crimes reached the capital, people from all walks of life paid close attention. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it had not received an official report from our officials stationed in Japan and declined to comment. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was our ambassador to Japan before the war. After analyzing the truth and background of this issue to our newspaper reporter, he temporarily reserved his personal opinions, but emphasized that in any case, in order to ensure that Japan does not engage in aggression again, supervision must be strict. Wang Chonghui, a legal scholar and government official, also believed that the control work after the signing of the peace treaty should not be ignored. However, he believed that the issue of whether the Japanese Emperor was responsible for war crimes and his abolition was not very important. Retaining the Emperor could prevent political and social turmoil in Japan and allow him to be responsible for the implementation of the peace treaty clauses. To prevent Japan from rising again and engaging in aggression, he believed that it could be done by completely disarming its military, re-educating its people's thinking, and establishing a democratic foundation. Wang Zhengting, a diplomat, believed that the inner cause of the Far East International Tribunal's Prosecutor's Office's decision was the political influence on the judiciary. Wang cited the example of Empress Dowager Cixi not being held responsible for war crimes after the Eight-Nation Alliance in the Gengzi Year, saying that this could avoid confusion caused by Japanese superstitious feelings, but if the law were to be investigated, it should be treated separately. A judicial scholar who did not want to be named said that throughout the entire course of Japanese aggression, the Japanese Emperor had personally participated in decision-making and had come out to lead. The measures of the Tokyo International Tribunal were not well considered. Another well-known international legal scholar also stated that the Japanese Emperor was by no means a "constitutional monarch" like the British Emperor. Although the authority of fire was in the hands of the military during the war, the Emperor still retained at least one-third of the decision-making power. This could be seen from Japan's unconditional surrender, or even more than that. Therefore, if it is said that the Emperor has no responsibility for war crimes, it is too much to exonerate him. As for the issue of the Emperor's abolition, it is also worth studying. The Emperor is above the constitution. Before the war, the Japanese legal scholar Tatsukichi Minobe was imprisoned for advocating that the Emperor was within the constitution. His quality in Japanese traditional psychology can be imagined. How to use strict supervision and re-education to completely eliminate the aggressive thoughts and systems attached to the Emperor's superstition is the most important thing.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Cancels Restrictions on Private Representatives Traveling to Japan for Trade</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] According to Yang Ligong, Director of the Trade Representative Office in Japan, MacArthur's headquarters opened private trade with Japan on August 15th of last year, but imposed restrictions on the number of private representatives from various countries traveling to Japan, with a proportional allocation. China was allocated 64 slots. This restriction has recently been announced by the Foreign Affairs Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters. According to a special statement recently issued by the bureau, all people from various countries who wish to engage in trade with Japan or settle property can now freely apply for entry and may bring cars. If they can solve their own housing problems, their families and servants will also be allowed to enter. Their length of stay has also been extended from the 21st to 60 days, and they can apply for semi-permanent residence for more than 60 days. If the work they are engaged in is proven to be beneficial to the revival of the Japanese economy, they may be allowed to reside there for a long time.</p>
<h3>Committee for Evaluating Reparations in Kind Appoints Committee Members</h3>

The evaluation committee has a total of nine members, and their names are as follows: two from the industrial sector, Zhi Bingyuan and Yan Yaoqiu; two from the business sector, Wang Xiaolai and Li Jianting; three from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Tong Jiling, Gu Baochang, and Wang Wei; and two from the Ministry of Finance, Yang Mianzhong and Yang Shoubiao.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Communist Bandits in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and Linkou are located between 175 and 180 miles from Harbin. Harbin is a major military base and a springboard for the Chinese Communists to advance south and attack the National Army in the Northeast and North China. Harbin and Jiamusi are the main centers of general military and political activities. Due to the large-scale development of the two places by the Chinese Communists, they do not seem to worry about the loss of the two places. Obviously, the battle of Yan'an taught the Chinese Communists that the "depth defense" of the headquarters is better than exposing the entire administrative organization to the front line. The headquarters of the "Democratic Allied Army" is located in Harbin. The overall strategy of the Communist Party's activities is planned there and then implemented in various places, from the Northeast through Central China to Guangdong. Li Lisan is also stationed in Harbin. It is feared that there is no one among the Chinese Communist leaders who hates the United States more than Li Lisan. Li's official title is "Minister of Fortification," which is quite novel. He does not have to build cities with stones everywhere. His responsibility is to guide the establishment of ideological projects to prevent the National Army. In Harbin, there is also the "Supply Department" led by Peng Zhen, the "Administrative Committee" chaired by Lin Feng (with Gao Chongming as the vice chairman of the committee), and the General Headquarters of the "Railway Protection Army" commanded by Lu Zhengcao. It is generally believed that Harbin is Mao Zedong's base camp, but it is believed that Mao often travels between Harbin and Jiamusi. Jiamusi also has the Northeast University, the ideological fortress of the Chinese Communists, as well as the Artillery Academy, the Foreign Language Academy, the Automobile School, the Tank School, and the Rear Hospital Medical College. In addition, in Jiamusi, there is also the "Central Politburo" presided over by Tai Qing (transliteration), whose deputy is Zhou Yuan (transliteration). Bayan is located northeast of Harbin, where there is the Military and Political University, with He Changgong (transliteration) as the president. The school has branches in several cities in the Northeast. Among Mao Zedong's senior staff, no one knows the Soviet Union better than Li Lisan. Li Lisan has participated in the Chinese Communist Party for more than 25 years, but 16 years ago, Li Lisan turned against his old friend Mao Zedong, resulting in the liquidation of the "Li Lisan Line." Li went to the Soviet Union. A year ago, the two reconciled and Li Lisan returned to China. Yoshio Oshima, a Japanese man, said</p>
<h3>North China Contains Large Aluminum Deposits</h3>
<p>Yoshio Oshima, a Japanese man, said</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th, United Press] Yoshio Oshima, former founder of Oshima Kogyo Co., Ltd. in Jehol and now a member of the Social Democratic Party, said that China may be the world's largest aluminum producing country, and North China has the natural conditions to build the world's largest aluminum industry. When the Japanese army occupied North China, Oshima studied the mineral deposits in North China and confirmed that North China had the necessary natural conditions for aluminum production. He said that the entire Kailuan Coal Mine is composed of aluminous earth, and aluminous earth is the basic raw material for aluminum production. The electricity can be generated by using Kailuan coal production. This electricity can be supplied almost infinitely. Another essential raw material for aluminum production is cryolite. Natural cryolite is only produced in Iceland, and the cryolite stored there is rapidly depleted. However, it can be made by combining fluorite, and there is a large amount of fluorite along the Luan River, which is not difficult to transport by boat. Oshima pointed out that the above resources are concentrated in a small area of North China, and only capital and technology are needed.</p>

<h3>Consoling Revolutionary and Anti-Japanese War Widows and Orphans in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The 20th was the second day of the 14th anniversary of the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement Association, in conjunction with the Ministry of National Defense's Bereavement Affairs Department, the Information Bureau, the Nanjing Consolation Branch, the Bereaved Families School, and the Nanjing Red Cross Branch, jointly organized a consolation meeting for revolutionary and anti-Japanese war widows and orphans. It was held at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the Lishi Society. Before the meeting, the New Life Movement Association dispatched six special military vehicles to welcome the widows and orphans. Despite the rain, over 300 families of widows and orphans attended, most of whom were destitute orphans and widows. At the beginning of the meeting, General Secretary Huang Renlin first reported the significance of the consolation and the donations from various circles. Then, Director Wu Zhongxing of the Bereavement Affairs Department, Deputy Mayor Ma Yuanfang of Nanjing, and President Shen Hui of the Nanjing Red Cross Branch delivered speeches, expressing deep respect, mourning, and infinite sympathy and concern for the comrades who had sacrificed themselves for the country. After the meeting, there was a luncheon with 35 tables of New Life Movement cuisine, donated by the Nanjing Chinese and Western Restaurant Trade Association.

The retail price of white rice has reached over 2.2 million yuan, and it is still not easy to purchase. Some rice shops are even afraid that it will be difficult to replenish their stocks after selling, so they are either temporarily closing early or simply suspending business. In the rice market, because the Social Affairs Department of the county government is closely monitoring transactions and absolutely does not allow manipulation and speculation to create a black market, it has set a limit price of 1.75 million yuan per stone of white rice.

The weather is overcast and rainy, and few goods have arrived from the countryside, so it is unlikely that the situation will turn around tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Strong Support for UN Agencies: US Policy Remains Steadfast; Truman and Marshall Express Clearly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have submitted a joint report to Congress regarding the United Nations agencies. Truman stated that despite disappointments, the UN agencies are still making progress. Marshall also said that although a few member states have been stubborn, the entire organization is making resolute progress. President Truman also stated that the United States will, as in the past, share responsibilities and provide leadership as a member of the United Nations, hoping to encourage every member state to assist the UN agencies in the same spirit to achieve their goals and make its principles have a practical effect on the problems faced by the United Nations. The United States' trust in UN agencies will never diminish. The United States will demonstrate its trust by strongly supporting and participating in the United Nations. Strengthening UN agencies will continue to be the cornerstone of American foreign policy. Recent progress within the UN agencies has had its disappointments, especially regarding the establishment of international atomic energy controls and various political and economic issues directly or indirectly related to international security. However, overall, the UN agencies are still progressing. In addition to mentioning the aforementioned disappointments, Marshall's report also expressed regret over the lack of agreement on the international security force issue and the obstruction by a few countries of the establishment of peace in certain special security issues such as Greece. He also predicted that disagreements will inevitably continue to arise in the future, and that this should not be considered unusual.</p>
<h3>On the Palestine Issue: We Maintain Our Original Position; Liu Kai Participates in Drafting the Jerusalem Statute</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 19th] Chinese representative Liu Kai stated today to the UN Trusteeship Council that his participation in drafting the Jerusalem Statute will not hinder the Chinese government from taking any position on the entire Palestine issue in the future. Ambassador Liu Kai recalled that the Chinese delegation insisted during the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue that any satisfactory solution must be based on the consent of the directly relevant parties. Liu continued that China abstained from voting when the General Assembly voted on the Palestine issue, and the Chinese government's position on the Palestine issue has not changed. Liu explained that the main task of the Trusteeship Council is to draft the Jerusalem Statute, a specialized task that is unrelated to the political aspects of the broader Palestine issue or other matters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The United Nations Palestine Committee recommended organizing an international army. China indicated its unwillingness to support this proposal, dealing it another blow. At today's Security Council vote, at least two of the five major powers will abstain, and possibly three. British Colonial Secretary Jones stated at a press conference on the 18th that Britain will adhere to its abstention policy adopted during last autumn's General Assembly debate on the partition plan. Although the French representative has not indicated, abstention is also possible. However, the United States has not yet announced its position, and the Soviet Union remains secretive. It is generally believed that even with the support of the US and the Soviet Union, this proposal will be difficult to obtain the required seven votes majority out of eleven. Syria opposed the partition in the General Assembly, and Argentina and Colombia also abstained. China's position has been explained by Vice Minister Liu in the Trusteeship Council. [United Press, Cairo, 19th] An Arab League source stated today that the Arab League Political Committee has decided to adopt economic boycotts against the United States and other countries supporting the partition of Palestine, but such boycotts are not intended to be implemented before the United Nations decides to send an international army to Palestine. India and Pakistan are willing to support Vietnam.</p>
<h3>The UN Is Watching the Development of the Situation in Vietnam; India and Pakistan Are Willing to Support Vietnam</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The Indian and Pakistani delegations both stated today that if the dispute between the Republic of Vietnam and France comes to a showdown within the UN framework, India and Pakistan will support Vietnam. However, they do not wish to take the initiative due to their own domestic affairs. This opinion of the two countries arose from the Arab League's statement of support for Vietnamese independence. Vietnam unsuccessfully attempted to have India bring this case before the UN agencies last autumn. Observers predict that the rapidly deteriorating situation in Vietnam will attract the attention of the United Nations. France is seeking to restore the Annamite King Bao Dai to the throne.</p>

Conspiracies by princes to usurp the throne have been frequent, and this one appears to have succeeded. It is also learned that former Yemeni Prime Minister al-Wazir has been appointed the country's Islamic leader. The whereabouts of the eldest son, the crown prince, and the army commander-in-chief are unknown. It is reported that the country is now calm.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The son of the King of Yemen, al-Islam, arrived here this afternoon by train from London. It is said that his sudden departure from London was due to the assassination of the king.</p>
<h3>Menon Attends Mini-General Assembly to Report on the Korean Situation; Meeting Set to Reconvene Next Tuesday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The United Nations Mini-General Assembly convened today to discuss the Korean problem. Indian representative Menon, chairman of the representative delegation stationed in Korea, reported on the failure of efforts to assist in the unification of Korea. He said that since the end of the war, Korea has suffered harsh treatment, and Korean public opinion unanimously believes that the United Nations is their last hope. If this hope is also destroyed, incidents may break out in Korea, becoming a flashpoint for disaster in Asia and the world.</p>
<p>Menon reported to the forty-eight country representatives for one hour and twenty minutes. The Soviet bloc countries still did not participate in the meeting, and Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Paraguay were also absent. Menon also said that the delegation does not wish to admit the inability to implement the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. The delegation unanimously believes that a glimmer of hope for achieving a unified Korean government still exists, and efforts must continue. The United Nations cannot abandon Korea. The Mini-General Assembly then decided by a vote of thirty-seven to one to adjourn until the morning of the 24th to allow the representatives to study Menon's report. The Canadian and Lebanese representatives advocated swift action, while US representative Jessup supported the delay, but stated that the United States considers this issue urgent and that the representative delegation stationed in Korea must continue its work without a doubt. Menon also said that military occupation by Japanese forces went smoothly, but military occupation of Korea has encountered obstacles everywhere, and criticism of US military commander Hodge can be heard everywhere. He personally believes that this is a healthy sign of democracy, better than the Japanese's blind worship of MacArthur. One party estimates North Korean troops at as many as 800,000, while Hodge says only 200,000. In this situation, the United States cannot withdraw its troops from Korea for a considerable period. A recent telegram from Seoul from a certain news agency seems to have caused a misunderstanding. The telegram mentioned the establishment of a puppet government in North Korea, which is misleading. When he arrived at the airport in New York, he asked about the Soviet Union's establishment of a government in Korea, ready to take over South Korea. To the best of our knowledge, the nature of the North Korean regime has not changed recently. The government was established before the visit to Korea by the representative delegation, and the purpose was certainly not to hinder the delegation. At the same time, the delegation received a large amount of evidence in the US military occupation zone regarding the restriction or deprivation of civil rights. This raised questions about whether elections could be conducted freely, and this situation needs to be corrected. Fortunately, the military authorities and the South Korean provisional government have expressed their willingness to do their utmost to guarantee free elections and have already issued preliminary orders in this regard.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty; Austria Tends to Accept Soviet Demands</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The Four Power representatives' meeting to discuss the Austrian treaty was held here today. It is reported that the US delegation believes the Soviet Union's demands regarding German assets in Austria are still excessive, but Austria is eager for the peace treaty to be concluded so that foreign troops can withdraw as soon as possible, so it is willing to accept the Soviet demands in order to end the occupation. The Soviet Union is demanding roughly two-thirds of Austria's oil production, two-thirds of the oil extraction rights in eastern Austria for fifty years, and refining equipment with an annual output of 450,000 tons. The Soviet Union is also demanding to acquire all the Danube River Shipping Company's assets in Hungary and 55 percent of its assets in Austria, and finally demanding that Austria compensate the Soviet Union 100 million US dollars in cash within two years.</p>
<h3>Truman Campaign Speech: Announces Plan to Prevent Economic Panic</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] President Truman officially launched his campaign for the next presidential term on the 19th, delivering a speech announcing a ten-year plan to expand agricultural production, increase employment, and raise the minimum wage, and stated that this plan can definitely be implemented and will definitely be done. Truman accused the Republican Party of causing rural bankruptcy, business collapse, and labor despair, and should be held responsible for the worst economic panic in history. The president delivered his speech at the Jackson Day celebration attended by more than 1,000 Democratic leaders from across the country.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] President Truman, while attending the Democratic Jefferson-Jackson Memorial Day dinner on the evening of the 19th, delivered a speech condemning the Congress controlled by the Republican Party for lacking attention to the "truth" of the problems facing the United States today. He also said: He "cannot believe in this group of reactionaries." Truman pointed out that the current Congress "does not understand and does not want to understand all the truth, so the Democratic Party should be responsible for enabling the United States to take the correct direction." He said he hoped to publish the "entire facts" of "reactionary" activities.</p>
<h3>North Korea Organizing a Government Has Not Yet Become a Reality</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Responsible sources close to the State Department stated today that the news from Seoul that the Soviet Union had established a puppet government in North Korea was a misunderstanding of a broadcast by Pyongyang Radio. Pyongyang Radio only stated that the establishment of the North Korean government and its constitution were under consideration, but have not yet been realized. A certain US officer in Seoul was oversensitive, mistakenly thought it had become a reality, and rashly cited it. Britain denies submitting to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Antarctic Territory Dispute: US and Britain in Talks; Britain Denies Submitting to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British Foreign Office denied that the British government intends to submit the Falkland Islands issue to the United Nations for resolution. It also stated that London and Washington are currently discussing the issue, which falls within the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</p>
<h3>Czech Social Democratic Party Joins Anti-Communist Front</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Prague, 19th] It is reported that the Czech Social Democratic Party decided tonight to break away from the Communist Party and join the anti-communist front. The anti-communist front now occupies 62 percent of Congress, and the Communist Party occupies 38 percent. Previously, the Communist Party occupied 52 percent. At the same time, the national election campaign is tense, and the election date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Anti-Communist Leader Claims US-Soviet War Is Hard to Avoid</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] Bulgarian Agrarian Party leader Dimitrov, currently exiled in the United States, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee on the 19th, stating that "the United States is the number one target of world communism," and that traitors in the United States are following Soviet instructions. Once the Communist Party gains power, they will return to rule the Americans. Dimitrov said that a US-Soviet war seems inevitable, but the Soviet Union does not currently want war because they are not ready.</p>
<h3>British Defense Budget Tightened: Military Size to be Reduced to 716,000 Next Year; Maintaining Military Strength to Safeguard National Security</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The Ministry of Defense announced that the number of British troops will be reduced from 940,000 at the end of March this year to 716,000 at the end of March 1949. Military spending will also be reduced from £899 million last year to £692.66 million.</p>
<p>The projected troop numbers for the three armed forces on the first and last days of the fiscal year from April 1, 1948, to March 31, 1949, are as follows: the Navy will be 145,000 for both days. The Army will be 534,000 on April 1 this year and 345,000 on March 31 next year. The Air Force will be 261,000 on April 1 this year and 226,000 on March 31 next year. The allocation of the total military spending of £692.6 million for the fiscal year is as follows: Navy £153 million, Army £305 million, Air Force £173 million, Ministry of Supply £61 million, and Ministry of Defense £600,000. The Ministry of Defense also announced that compulsory military service will continue to be implemented in the coming years, but the conscription age will be gradually raised from 18 to 18 years and 9 months. The Ministry of Defense also stated that the government is determined to retain the military strength to support its international position, safeguard its national security, maintain its global interests, and enable Britain to share the responsibility of maintaining world peace.</p>
<h3>Shigeru Yoshida and Hitoshi Ashida Fiercely Compete for Prime Minister; Left-Wing Socialist Party Still Supports Katayama</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th] It is reported that a fierce competition will take place between Liberal Party leader Yoshida and Democratic Party leader Ashida in the election of the new prime minister in the Japanese parliament on the afternoon of the 21st. Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio declared on the 20th that the election competition is between Liberal Party Yoshida and Democratic Party Ashida. Ashida clearly stated on the 20th that he opposes Katayama's resignation as prime minister, but the left-wing socialist parties in both houses are still planning to support him to take office.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The question of who will succeed as Japan's next prime minister has now become the central topic of discussion in Japanese political circles and among the general public. The Democratic Party had already resolved on the 19th to unanimously support President Ashida. The Liberal Party is adhering to Yoshida, and the conservative small association faction seems to have a tendency to merge with them. Only the attitude of the Socialist Party has not yet been determined. Although the right wing hopes to support Ashida, the left wing firmly disagrees. Therefore, the right wing deeply fears a party split that would undermine its determination to support Ashida as prime minister to the end. From this, it is also believed that in the nomination vote on the 21st, Katayama may still be nominated again. It is generally believed that the attitude of the National Cooperative Party on the 21st nomination may affect the prime ministerial candidate. If the National Cooperative Party supports Ashida, then the result of the vote will be Ashida, Yoshida, and Katayama in that order, but none will exceed a majority. However, Ashida's chances of being elected are very high. Conversely, if the National Cooperative Party supports Yoshida, then Yoshida's hopes of being elected are extremely high. Also, if they support Katayama, then the order of election will be Katayama, Yoshida, and Ashida. At this time, the attitude of the Democratic Party will still determine which of Katayama and Yoshida wins. Regarding the issue of Japan's next prime minister, the most noteworthy aspects at present are the Democratic Party's policy agreement with the Socialist Party and the movements of the National Cooperative Party.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese House of Councillors also officially decided to implement the nomination vote for the next prime minister at 1:00 p.m. on the 21st. The Green Breeze Society, which has the largest number of members, can control the decision, so its movements are extremely important. So far, the majority of them seem to support Liberal Party President Yoshida. Secondly, the movements of more than 40 members of the Socialist Party are also noteworthy. Although it is expected that Yoshida can be elected in the House of Councillors, the margin is extremely small, so it is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Democratic Party Redrafts the Four-Party Policy Agreement Plan</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] After the Democratic Party sent the policy agreement plan to the Socialist, Liberal, and National Cooperative parties separately, the Liberal Party formally rejected it. The Socialist Party also complained that the content was empty and demanded the addition of specific opinions. Therefore, the party drafted a specific four-party policy agreement yesterday and submitted it to the Socialist and National Cooperative parties. Its content consists of the following five items: (1) Comprehensive production enhancement countermeasures; (2) Inflation prevention countermeasures; (3) National management of important industries; (4) Labor-management coordination plans such as peaceful resolution of disputes; (5) Central and local tax system reorganization plan. It can be submitted to the Army Department for review.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Revising US Cotton Loan Plan for Japan: Can Be Submitted to the Army Department for Review Soon</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Liaison Office, Tokyo, 20th] The US syndicate's plan to lend Japan $60 million to purchase US cotton has been slightly modified by MacArthur and can be returned to the US Army Department for review soon.</p>
<h3>Shunroku Hata and Sadao Araki, etc., Indicted by International Court</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Today's indictment by the International Tribunal's Prosecutor's Office accuses Shunroku Hata of intentionally promoting Hideki Tojo to power in order to lead Japan quickly into war with England and Italy. Due to Tojo's appointment as Minister of the Army, the entire cabinet was subsequently placed under the control of the Army. The indictment further states that Kanji Doihara, as commander of the Japanese forces stationed in China, led Japanese troops into the heart of China in an attempt to transform the Chinese government into a local regime and ultimately destroy it completely. In 1939, when he served as Minister of the Army, he fully supported and sponsored the large-scale war of aggression in China. He is also responsible for the crimes committed by the Japanese troops in China from March 1941 to November 1944. Because the Japanese troops under his command engaged in various crimes such as arson, murder, rape, looting, and kidnapping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] According to the International Military Tribunal's indictment against Sadao Araki, the former Japanese Minister of the Army and Minister of Education, Araki stated in 1933 that those who oppose Japan's expansion into Northeast China and the policies of the Japanese Empire "should be dealt with with bullets and bayonets." The prosecutor read Araki's indictment stating that during his time in office, he followed this policy of armed aggression. He frequently drafted plans for aggression publicly or secretly and taught the Japanese people to expand military aggression. Araki agreed to place "Manchukuo" under the control of the Kwantung Army during his time as Minister of the Army. He admitted that he had drafted plans to occupy Jehol and other three provinces in North China. Araki also admitted that the Japanese cabinet's decision in 1931 to occupy the four northeastern provinces was the result of his plan. After Araki became Minister of Education, the propaganda launched by Japan to defend its aggressive actions was also greatly strengthened. In a certain film, Araki can be seen shouting loudly, admonishing the Japanese people to follow the plans of their military leaders to conquer the world. He also used the slogan of "Co-Prosperity Sphere" as a rallying cry, and his demeanor resembled that of Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th] Former Japanese Prime Ministers Hiranuma and Hirota, defendants in the war crimes trials, were brought before the Far East International Tribunal today to hear the prosecutors' indictments against them. Hirota was a disciple of the leader of the Black Dragon Society, an organization composed of extreme Japanese nationalists. His main crime was implementing Japan's policy of aggression against China. The elderly Hiranuma, who served as President of the Privy Council for many years and had a great influence on Japanese political circles, was accused of supporting Konoe's policy towards China. On June 10, 1939, he met with Wang Jingwei and allowed him to support the puppet government. On May 4 of the same year, he told Hitler that Japan could provide military assistance to Germany if necessary. Next Monday is Washington's Birthday, and the International Court will suspend hearings for one day.</p>
<h3>Dismantling Japanese Armaments: Pan Youxin Reiterates His Position</h3>
<p>Says the Soviet Union's Attitude in the Far Eastern Commission is Impartial</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, today submitted a written statement to the American press, stating that American newspapers published "biased and coercive" articles, calling the Soviet Union a "disruptive element" in the Far Eastern Commission. The Soviet Union lodges a serious protest against this. The Soviet Union's statements in the Far Eastern Commission have been flawless, its purpose being merely to clarify certain key points. The majority of members of the commission also agree with the Soviet Union's views. The Soviet Union reserved its opinion and did not vote in favor of the proposal to expand the commission's organization and take necessary steps to ensure Japan's thorough demilitarization because the Soviet Union's supplementary proposal was rejected. However, to call the Soviet Union a "disruptive element" simply because it used its veto power is extremely absurd and ridiculous. Regarding Pakistan's application to join the Far Eastern Commission, it is also a misunderstanding that the Soviet Union refused its participation. The Soviet Union only advocated discussing this issue at the next meeting so that the representatives present could consult their governments. It also stated that the Soviet Union has the following two main points to supplement the Japanese demilitarization proposal: (1) Restrict the Japanese military police to using only "small arms" to maintain law and order; (2) Ensure that all confiscated Japanese military equipment is completely destroyed within six months at the latest. Its conclusion states: American newspapers distort the report, saying that the Soviet Union is a "disruptive element" in the Far Eastern Commission, which only causes public opinion to be terrified.</p>
<h3>Meteorite Explodes Over American Skies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Garnett, Kansas, 19th, United Press] Authorities announced that the terrifying explosion heard over Kansas last night was caused by a meteorite entering the Earth's atmosphere and exploding due to friction with the air. A scientist in New York said that reports indicate that the meteorite must have been extremely large, and if it had fallen in a residential area, the loss would have been great. When the meteorite exploded, its intense vibration caused residents of Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma to panic. Glass windows shattered, and houses shook. Before the explosion, the meteorite emitted a plume of cyan-white smoke, rising horizontally into the sky. The meteorite seemed to have completely disintegrated on the ground, and despite extensive searches, no fragments were found. Second Highest in National Income</p>
<h3>Deanna Durbin</h3>
<p>Second Highest in National Income</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The Treasury Department announced that the three men who earned the most money in the United States during the ten quarters from 1944 to 1946 were movie mogul Mayer, and the woman who earned the most was movie star Deanna Durbin. Mayer held the record for the highest individual income for eight of the past nine years. In the year ending August 1945, his income from Loew's Pictures was $502,571. The second highest was producer Wanger, with an income of $282,900. Deanna Durbin's annual income was $262,875. The aforementioned income only includes income from special companies and not total personal income. According to records from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mayer's income in 1946 reached $898,571, while the Treasury Department announced that Deanna Durbin's total income in 1946 was $310,728, ranking second in national personal income and first in women's personal income.</p>

<h3>The Memoirs of Cordell Hull (27)</h3>
<p>— Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance. Translated by this newspaper's editorial department.</p>
<p>Without a Word, Turn Around, and Walk Away</p>
<p>The proposal I gave to Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu on November 26th (i.e., the ten-point peaceful resolution plan) was a sincere effort to maintain our negotiations and continue the process. We placed unwavering hope on it, hoping that even at the last minute, some sense of reason could penetrate the minds of the Eastern militarists.</p>
<p>Soon, Japanese propaganda—especially after Japan began to suffer severe defeats—attempted to distort our November 26th memorandum, calling it an "ultimatum." This is a characteristic trait of the Japanese: using completely fabricated excuses to deceive their people and gain their support for military plunder.</p>
<p>Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu themselves admitted that the responsibility for the breakdown of relations with us lay with Japan. On the same day, November 26th, they sent a telegram to Tokyo, which was intercepted by our army and navy. This telegram suggested shifting the responsibility to us. They said: If we deliberately begin our planned actions during these negotiations, then the responsibility for the interruption of negotiations is in danger of shifting to us. Previously, she (the United States) could have considered suspending negotiations because of our invasion of Vietnam. Now, if we interrupt our negotiations without clarifying our intentions and suddenly begin unilateral action, then I am afraid she will use this point as anti-propaganda against us.</p>
<p>From the telegram that Foreign Minister Togo sent to Nomura and Kurusu on November 28th, one can see what was about to happen. This telegram stated that negotiations with us would soon be interrupted, but also stated: "I do not want you to create an impression that the negotiations have already been interrupted. You can merely tell them that you are waiting for instructions and state: although you do not yet know your government's views, in your opinion, the demands made by the Imperial government have always been very fair and have suffered great sacrifices to maintain peace in the Pacific."</p>
<p>In other words, the second stage of Kurusu's mission had arrived. The first stage was to force us to accept Japan's hegemony in the East. After this failed, the first task was to confuse us with talks before the White forces were ready to attack.</p>
<p>On November 29th, I saw the excerpts from the speeches that Tojo and Togo were preparing to deliver at the joint conference of the Greater Japan East Asia League and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association on November 30th. One passage in Tojo's telegram said: "Chiang Kai-shek is colluding with Britain, America, and communism, sacrificing strong men and promising youth for ineffective resistance against Japan. This fact is only for Britain and America to fish in troubled waters in East Asia, pitting East Asian nations against each other so that they can seize hegemony in East Asia... For the sake of human glory and self-esteem, we must drive this behavior out of East Asia." After consideration, I discussed this with our military authorities and Far East experts, and repeatedly studied various reports we had previously received regarding Japan's new actions in Vietnam. That night (November 29th), I called the President, emphasized the crisis of a Japanese attack, and urged him to return to Washington earlier. The President agreed.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt arrived in Washington on the morning of Monday, December 1st. Before he arrived, Nomura and Kurusu came to the State Department to visit me and asked me why the President had returned to the capital early. The Japanese envoys were obviously afraid that the President's return to Washington would conflict with their instructions to confuse us with negotiations. I said that one of the reasons was the Japanese Prime Minister's grandiose statements.</p>
<p>On December 5th, I sent instructions by radio to our diplomatic representatives in Tokyo and other locations in the Far East, instructing them to destroy codes, secret vaults, passports, etc., and close offices, dismiss local staff, and, in case of emergency, cut off communication with the State Department.</p>
<p>On the next day, December 6th, we seemed to feel that the long-threatened Japanese military advance to the south was underway.</p>
<p>The President believed that the time had come for him to send a telegram to the Emperor of Japan. He sent me a draft of the telegram, which was similar in content to the draft telegram I had sent him the previous week. I and my colleagues read it and believed that some of the wording should be revised for technical accuracy. After we revised it, we sent the draft back to the White House. That same evening, Mr. Roosevelt sent it back to me, unchanged, with a letter attached stating: "Dear Cordell: Send this telegram to Grew quickly. I think it can be used with the "gray code" (note: the gray code is the least secret code of the US State Department). This can save time, and I am not afraid of the telegram being intercepted—Roosevelt."</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, I went to the office as usual. Since entering the State Department in 1935, I have worked almost every Sunday.</p>
<p>On this morning, I received a series of intercepted telegrams, including a long telegram consisting of fourteen sections from Foreign Minister Togo to Nomura and Kurusu. This was a response to our November 26th proposal. Attached to the long telegram was a short telegram instructing the ambassador to present the original telegram to our government today. If possible, the time should be 1:00 PM that afternoon. This was the final moment.</p>
<p>The Japanese note was worse than an insult. The telegram said that our proposal "disregards Japan's sacrifices in the four-year China Incident, threatens the survival of the Empire itself, and impairs its honor and dignity." The telegram also said that we conspired with Britain and other countries to hinder Japan's efforts to establish a new order and peace in East Asia. The telegram concluded: "In view of the attitude of the United States Government, the Japanese Government has had no other choice but to consider that it is impossible to reach an agreement through further negotiations."</p>
<p>This note did not declare war, nor did it sever diplomatic relations. Japan did not need these preliminary steps to begin its attack.</p>
<p>Around noon, Ambassador Nomura called me and requested that I meet with him and Kurusu at 1:00 PM. I accepted his request.</p>
<p>A few minutes after one o'clock, Nomura called me again and requested that the appointment be postponed to 1:45 PM. I agreed.</p>
<p>The Japanese envoys arrived at the State Department at 2:05 PM and went straight to the diplomatic waiting room. Around this time, the President called me from the White House. His voice was very calm, but also a little urgent.</p>
<p>He said: "There is a report that Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor." I asked: "Has the telegram been confirmed?" He said: "No."</p>
<p>We both thought that this report might be true, but I suggested that he should find a way to confirm it. At that time, I thought of my appointment with the Japanese envoys.</p>
<p>With me in the office were Legal Advisor Hackworth and Berle. Berle was usually present when I negotiated with the Japanese. I said to them:</p>
<p>"The President has received an unconfirmed report that Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor. The Japanese envoys are waiting to see me, and I know what they want. They will reject our November 26th note, and maybe they will tell us, declaring war. I am reluctant to receive him."</p>
<p>But after consideration, I decided to receive them, because the report received by the President had not been confirmed. Maybe there was a one percent chance that this report was incorrect. I roughly discussed with Hackworth and Berle what I was going to say to the Japanese envoys. When I ordered the Japanese envoys to be received, Hackworth left, while Berle stayed in the room.</p>
<p>Nomura and Kurusu entered my office at 2:20 PM. I greeted them coldly and did not ask them to sit down.</p>
<p>Nomura said in an overly humble manner: his government instructed him to present us with a note at 1:00 PM this afternoon, but it was late because of the difficulty in translating the telegram. Then he handed me his government's note.</p>
<p>I asked him why he specified 1:00 PM when he first requested to see me. He said he did not know, but said that this was the instruction he had received.</p>
<p>I pretended to read the note. I knew its content in advance, but of course I could not show this fact.</p>
<p>After reading two or three sections, I asked Nomura: whether he was presenting this document under his government's instructions. He said yes. After I read it roughly, I faced Nomura and looked at him intently.</p>
<p>I said: "I must state that in the past nine months of negotiations with you, I have never said a dishonest word. This can absolutely be proven by facts. In my fifty years of government service, I have never seen a document including so much shameless hypocrisy and distortion—the extent of its shameless hypocrisy and distortion is so great that until today, I never thought that any government in the current world could say it.</p>
<p>Nomura did not seem to say anything. His expression was calm, but I felt that he was under great emotional stress. I rescued him with a gesture. I nodded towards the door, and the Japanese envoys turned around, walked away, and bowed their heads without saying a word.</p>
<p>In the rich language of the Tennessee Mountains, I had "cursed the Japanese envoys away," but in fact I had told them what I had said above. There has never been a more intense degree of "cursing away" than this time.</p>
<p>Berle recorded what I said. After the Japanese envoys left, I immediately called my stenographer in and read out what I had said to them from memory. This was the same as what I released to the press. Nomura's last meeting with me was as clumsy as his previous handling of discussions. His government instructed him to arrange to meet me at 1:00 PM, the purpose was to hand the note to me a few minutes before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Nomura's embassy falsely claimed that it was due to the slowness of translating the telegram. But since Nomura knew the importance of the deadline, even if he only received the first few lines of the note, he should have instructed the embassy to send the subsequent translations to the State Department, and he himself should have come to see me at 1:00 PM. Therefore, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor without warning, probably more than an hour before Nomura and Kurusu presented the note.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Japanese envoys left, I spoke to the President on the phone and repeated to him what I had told the Japanese envoys. He expressed satisfaction that I had spoken so forcefully, but by that time, he had already received reports about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>After 3 PM, I went to the White House and talked with the President and other figures for forty minutes. Mr. Roosevelt was very serious in his attitude and conversation. The magnitude of the gains Japan had made in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was already very clear. But I saw that neither he nor we lost confidence for a moment in America's ability to deal with the crisis.</p>

<h3>Draft of Housing Rent Standards Passed: Adjusted Every Three Months, Calculated Based on the Average of the Previous Three Months' Housing Index; To Be Implemented After Being Submitted to the Senate for Resolution</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Recently, the cost of living index has continued to rise, and housing owners' income cannot cover expenses. In order to handle housing rent disputes, the Land Administration Bureau has formulated the "Provisional Measures for Housing Rental Management in This City," which was promulgated and implemented on August 9, 1947. Now, the bureau, after inviting representatives from relevant agencies and organizations in the city, has held repeated consultations and, after integrating opinions from all parties, has drafted the "Draft of Housing Rent Standards in This City," which was submitted and passed at yesterday's city government meeting and will be sent to the Senate for resolution and implementation. The following is a record of the housing rent standards: (1) The housing rent in this city shall be based on the rent amount in 1937. If the pre-war rent amount cannot be verified or the house was built after 1937, the base amount shall be estimated by the Land Administration Bureau with reference to nearby similar houses. (2) The maximum rent for residential houses shall be based on the average of the housing class indices for civil servants and workers in the city for the previous three months. (3) The maximum rent for houses inhabited by teachers shall not exceed 10% of the cost of living index for public school teachers and civil servants. The aforementioned public school teachers and civil servants are limited to those whose salaries are indeed calculated according to the cost of living index for public school teachers and civil servants.

<h3>Land Administration Bureau Explains the Method of Rent Adjustment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the Land Administration Bureau, who spoke to reporters: The "Draft of Housing Rent Standards in Shanghai" passed at the municipal government meeting this morning, item two refers to the rent for residential houses, and the maximum rent shall be based on the average of the housing class indices for civil servants and workers in the city for the previous three months. That is, the housing index will be adjusted every three months from now on, and the rent for the subsequent three months will be calculated based on the average index of the housing class indices for civil servants and workers in the previous three months. For example, the rent for the three months of "April," "May," and "June" this year will be calculated based on the average index of the three months of "January," "February," and "March." The following will be inferred in the same way, and it will be announced by the Municipal Statistics Office every three months. In addition, all sub-tenants in the city will also comply with the housing rent standards.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Opposes Calculation According to Index</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Wang Lianfang, Liu Xiexun, Jiang Zhonghe, Sun Wenyi, and other directors and supervisors of the Nanjing Road Chamber of Commerce, in order to oppose the calculation of rent according to the cost of living index, specially hosted guests from all walks of life at the Dadong Restaurant at 6:00 PM yesterday, including municipal senators Guo Lingshuang, Shao Yongsheng, Zheng Shouchi, Mei Hao, Zhang Yiqu, Fei Shusheng, Yin Jiqian, Wang Xingtong, Chen Cunren, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shi Zhifu, Ma Junshuo, Yang Fusheng, Lao Zha District Chief Li Ruchun, lawyer Zheng Wenkai, and more than 50 representatives from industrial and commercial circles. Opinions were exchanged during the meeting, and everyone expressed sympathy. The Chamber of Commerce firmly stated that the adjustment of rent should absolutely not be calculated according to the cost of living index, for the following reasons: (1) Rent cannot be calculated based on materials. Not only is there a legal regulation, but the authorities also issued a prohibition early on. Now, the Land Administration Bureau is convening a meeting to calculate according to the cost of living index, which is tantamount to collecting rent according to materials, which violates laws and regulations. (2) The calculation of the cost of living index is based on the average of expenditures for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If rent is calculated according to the cost of living index again, it will be reversing cause and effect, rising each other. The cost of living index will rise endlessly. (3) If rent can be calculated according to the cost of living index, then all prices can use the cost of living index as an excuse for calculation. (4) The cost of building houses before the war was similar to the interest rate on bank deposits before the war. Today, banks already have clear regulations on the payment of pre-war deposits. Now, rent has increased many times more than pre-war deposits, and it must not be increased again. (5) If we want to alleviate the housing shortage, we can only encourage the construction of new houses, because the cost of building new houses is different, and the rent for new houses is originally not restricted. (6) According to the law, rent should originally be based on land prices. Currently, rent has already exceeded the legally allowable multiple of land prices by a great deal. (7) After the victory, due to the war and chaos caused by the communist bandits, the people have all endured painful sacrifices. It is hoped that after the bandits are pacified, the legal tender will be stable. Real estate developers are all members of the bourgeoisie, and they alone cannot endure it for a while, only seeking profit, wanting to drastically increase rent, so as to cause the cost of living index to rise and make the majority of the people bear a heavier burden. If this causes all prices to skyrocket, it will violate the original intention of the authorities to suppress prices. (8) If we say that rent is calculated according to the cost of living index, it is taking care of the rights of a small number of owners. May I ask, the majority of farmers in our country work hard to grow rice. The authorities still consider the whole country and prevent the prices from skyrocketing. Farmers' suffering should be considered before real estate developers. (9) Before the war, owners collected rent, including tap water, house donations, repair fees, and management fees. Now, all of the above fees are paid by the tenants themselves. The owner only has the expense of paying land tax obligations and the cost of rent collectors. What huge expenses can be said to exist? (10) Among the various agencies convened by the Land Administration Bureau to discuss rent, only representatives of the real estate industry spoke, while not a single member of the various tenant associations representing the city's residents was invited to participate and state their reasons, which is clearly biased.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Increases Tax Rates on Six Items; Amended Collection Rules Sent to the Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] With the Fifth General Meeting of the Municipal Council approaching, the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday submitted detailed explanations of the amended collection rules for six types of taxes (banquets, entertainment, slaughter, business licenses, vehicle licenses, and house tax) to the Municipal Council for resolution at the general meeting. The amendment involves raising the tax rates on various taxes, with the following key points: The old regulations had two levels of 10% and 20%. After being approved by the Municipal Council as a uniform 15%, the new tax law stipulates a uniform 20%. The original tax threshold has been cancelled and replaced with a "tax-free standard." The "tax-free standard" is to be drafted by the Finance Bureau according to Article 4 of the Banquet and Entertainment Tax Law, based on local prices. Furthermore, the banquet tax shall be levied on customers of all occupations, and no exemptions shall be granted without legal basis.</p>
<p>Entertainment Tax: The old law was 25%. This municipality reduced it to 20% for plays, as the cost of plays is relatively high, and the remaining 25%.

The above taxation cannot be exempted without legal basis.</p>
<p>Slaughter Tax: The old law was 5%. The new law changes it to 10% and includes mules and horses. The tax rate is levied based on the current price of the slaughtered livestock, and calculated based on the unit price per "shi jin" of its net weight. The unit price is investigated and announced by the Finance Bureau periodically. The net weight is specified as follows: (1) Fresh pork: 80 "shi jin" per head, (2) Fresh beef: 300 "shi jin" per head, (3) Fresh veal: 50 "shi jin" per head, (4) Fresh mutton: 20 "shi jin" per head, (5) Fresh mule meat: 150 "shi jin" per head, (6) Fresh horse meat: 200 "shi jin" per head (The above are all calculated per head).</p>

<h3>Eventful Time for the General Manager of Xin Sui; Zhu Bing Accused of Breach of Contract Again; Dispute Arises over Contract for Shipping Antiques; Palace Museum Files a Complaint for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zhu Bing, the general manager of Xin Sui Company, has recently been accused of breach of contract and bad faith by Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, and Huang Nianchou, the section chief, who filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. The Palace Museum stored its antiques in Chongqing, Leshan, and Emei during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, it was necessary to concentrate them in Chongqing for transportation. Six hundred four-ton trucks were needed, and it would take two months to complete the transportation. At that time, only Xin Sui Company in Chongqing had this capability, so they contacted Xin Sui Company. The vehicle rental and fuel costs were paid in advance at one-quarter of the amount stipulated by the Ministry of Communications Highway Administration, totaling more than 260 million legal tender. After Zhu signed the contract, he never fulfilled the contract, and only used three or four old trucks for transportation. He delayed until July 1946. After three months, the antiques were still not concentrated. When the Palace Museum urged him, Zhu claimed that there was a shortage of vehicles. So the Palace Museum sent personnel to accompany Zhu to the Highway Administration to borrow 100 trucks. The cost should be paid by Zhu, but the Palace Museum paid 483,300,000 yuan in advance. After the transportation was completed, it was settled in March 1947 and he was asked to return the money, but he ignored it. Because Zhu had various facts of breach of contract and bad faith, the Palace Museum yesterday filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Paper Mill Extorters; Three Criminals Confess Inside Information</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Three men in uniforms suddenly came to the Qinkong Paper Mill on Xietu Road on the morning of the day before yesterday, claiming to be members of the Inspection Brigade and came to search for hoarding of materials. Manager Li Kunquan received them and explained that all the raw materials stored in the factory were for the production of paper materials. The three men insisted on taking Li away, but after the factory director Xu Shaoliang pleaded, they agreed to contact him at Dasanyuan in the afternoon, and the three men left. Afterwards, the factory reported the incident to the Songshan Police Station, who sent undercover police officers to wait. When the three men arrived and demanded that Xu pay 100 million yuan before the matter could be settled, and agreed to pay the money the next day, the police officers did not arrest them at that time because of insufficient evidence. Yesterday afternoon, the factory prepared 20 million yuan in cash and 80 million yuan in checks at the original location. Just as the two parties were delivering the money, they were arrested. After being taken to the station for interrogation, they confessed that one was Chen Dehua, one was Li Yongchang, and one was Wan Changtai, and they admitted that they had impersonated extortionists, and confessed to the inside information of Ni Zhixiang. The case is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation today.</p>

<h3>American Petroleum Company Employee's Greed: Embezzlement of 7 Billion Solved; Dividing Into Small Amounts, Preparing to Flee to Hong Kong; After Arrest, Calmly Said "Success Depends on Heaven"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The American Petroleum Company in this city suffered an embezzlement of 7 billion yuan in funds by collection clerk Huang Limin on the 2nd of this month. Afterward, Huang disappeared without a trace. It was not until the morning of the 4th that the company's chief accountant, Shi Hengsi, discovered the matter. He immediately reported it to the Detective Section of the Police Department. The Section Chief ordered Tao Genrong, the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Investigation Unit, and officers Chen Fukang and Zhang Jinkui to handle the investigation. On the afternoon of the same day, around 4 p.m., they managed to arrest the suspect Huang and successively recovered 6 billion yuan of the stolen funds. The case was finally concluded yesterday, and it is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today. Huang, originally from Guangdong and only 25 years old, is a graduate of St. John's University in this city. He currently resides at 53 East Changzhi Road. During the war, he served as a second lieutenant officer in the Southeast Cadre Training Group of the Central Military Academy. After the victory, he was assigned to Shanghai to work for the Naval Department. Last year, he resigned for some reason and then got a job as a collection clerk at the American Petroleum Company. He was usually silent and reserved and was deeply</p>
<p>trusted by his superiors. Unfortunately, in June of last year, he was hit by an American military vehicle and injured his left leg. After recovering and returning to work, the expenses for medical treatment and other things were too high, and he felt financial difficulties. The company's</p>
<p>incoming and outgoing funds often exceeded 10 billion. Huang, blinded by greed, made a wrong decision and committed this shocking case of embezzlement. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, Huang was assigned to collect 7 billion yuan in gasoline payments from the Civil Air Transport, headed by General Chennault. At that time, seeing that the check from the Jin Cheng Bank (dated January 31st) had no payee written on it, he believed</p>
<p>it was a rare opportunity. He took the check to the China National Aviation Corporation and falsely told the company's accountant, Gu Daqian, that he had been entrusted by a relative or friend to ask him to find a way to convert it into interest-bearing deposits. Gu</p>
<p>was friendly with Huang and did not suspect anything. However, he said that such a large sum of money might be difficult to convert all at once and rescheduled the decision for the afternoon. When the time came, Gu only converted 2 billion, and when he intended to issue a check from the Bank of Communications for the remaining amount, Huang claimed that future conversions might be inconvenient and asked him to divide it into 25 checks, each with a face value of 200 million yuan. The next day (the 3rd), Huang used the checks to</p>
<p>exchange some for cash at the Bank of Communications. After exchanging the remaining amount for bank drafts from the same bank, he went to the Wing On Company and selected six expensive wristwatches and five Parker pens. At the International Jewelry Company, he selected four high-quality diamond rings, each weighing over two carats. He also bought 1,000 US dollars on the black market. At the same time, Huang was preparing to flee to Hong Kong. To avoid the attention of the police authorities, he planned to take a ship from Shanghai to Hankou and then travel south along the Yuehan Railway to Hong Kong. Therefore, on the morning of the 4th, he went to the Shenchang Watch Company on Nanjing East Road to continue buying</p>
<p>four expensive wristwatches, paying for all of them with bank drafts from the Bank of Communications. However, the company's staff, for caution's sake, required that the goods be delivered only after the check funds were received in the afternoon. Huang agreed and left. At that time, when Shi Hengsi, the chief accountant of the American Petroleum Company, was reviewing the account books on the 4th, he discovered that the payment from the Civil Air Transport had not been entered. He then inquired further. To his surprise, Huang had not been to the office for two days. After contacting Chennault by phone, he learned that the payment had been made on the morning of the 2nd. He immediately reported to the Police Department and asked Chennault to notify Jin Cheng Bank to</p>
<p>stop payment on the check. After Jin Cheng Bank found out that the check had been presented for exchange by the Bank of Communications that day, it notified the Bank of Communications to stop payment. Then, the Bank of Communications notified Gu Daqian. At that time, a staff member from Shenchang Watch Company was going to cash the check, so the Bank of Communications immediately notified the police. Since the police had received a report from the American Petroleum Company, they had dispatched Chief Tao and his officers to investigate in all directions. At this point, they rushed to investigate and learned that Huang would go to Shenchang Company in the afternoon to pick up the watches. So they</p>
<p>remained calm and waited at the company. When Huang arrived in the afternoon, they arrested him and took him to the station for interrogation, where he confessed to the previous events. After being arrested, Huang was calm and even said, "Man proposes, God disposes." Most of the stolen funds have now been recovered by the police, and the case is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial today.</p>

<h3>Spring Arrives at Jin Cheng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Lanzhou 15th Dispatch] The Chinese people cannot forget the Lunar New Year. This is especially true in the Northwest region. The farmers' festivals in Qinghai and Ningxia provinces have already been held on the 5th of this month, and it is said that they were very grand. However, the farmers' festival in this province will be held on the Lantern Festival, allowing farmers who have worked hard all year round to have a truly happy holiday of their own. Recently, the towns and villages have been busy preparing for the celebration of the farmers' festival—the community fire—the cost of which is expected to be huge, but allowing the public to vent their suppressed emotions in the booming drums and all the indulgent sights and sounds is also a virtuous policy that conforms to public sentiment.</p>
<p>The newspaper industry in Lanzhou did not take a holiday for the New Year. Instead, they took a "rest" in the old year, a full four days. They only started working on the fourth day of the New Year. During the four days without newspapers, everyone was like a blind person, unable to know what was happening in the battle situation in Shenyang. Some people borrowed radios from stores to listen to the broadcast, but the power went out before they could turn it on. The Lanzhou Power Plant initially announced that it would cut off power in different areas every three days, which meant that there would be electricity for three days out of four. However, the power plant could not fulfill its promise. Today, it announced that it would only supply power to different areas once every three days, so there would only be electricity for one day out of four. Today, a reporter was talking to several friends about the electricity in Lanzhou. It is said that the existing five generators can only generate more than 970 kilowatts of electricity. To supply electricity to 4,000 households and 80 factories, which exceeds its capacity four times, it has long been unable to bear the load. In the past six months, the trend of stealing electricity has been particularly prevalent. There are quite a few people using transformers. The power plant does not dare to investigate, and even if they find out, there is nothing they can do. How can the lights be turned on? Now that the New Year has just begun, those who are idle and those who have money are playing mahjong all night long, or playing cards until midnight. How can they not change from "stopping" once every three days to "supplying" once every three days? Another reason is that the source of light and heat in Lanzhou, the Agan Town Coal Mine, was closed for 40 days during the Lunar New Year, and the coal supply has been temporarily cut off. The power plant has not been able to purchase and store enough coal for one and a half months (about 1,000 tons), so it has to blame the machines and use it as an excuse to stop power supply. The new power generating equipment has only been shipped halfway and is still delayed on the way. The other half is still in Shanghai. If the transportation cost of these machines (about 20 billion yuan) cannot be obtained, the entire city of Lanzhou will be plunged into the abyss of darkness!</p>
<p>In the situation of dim lighting, everyone's mood is particularly bad.</p>
<p>Unfortunate events occur frequently. At around 4 p.m. on the 10th, Li Chengbi, a physics and chemistry teacher at the Lanzhou University Affiliated Middle School, was assassinated. A bullet entered from under his right rib and exited through his back. At that time, the sound of firecrackers was constant, so it did not attract attention, and the murderer has calmly escaped. At around 3 p.m. on the 12th, Liang Junshu and Liang Chengyu in Lin Sen Road quarreled and cursed each other, which eventually led to Liang Chengyu hitting Liang Junshu with a stick. The next morning, he died from his injuries. On the night of the 12th, a young man, Ma Bocheng (19 years old), was scolded by his father for returning home late after watching a play. Unexpectedly, he hanged himself. Zhang Shurong and Zhang Delin, who were injured in a gunpowder explosion caused by making firecrackers on January 31st of this year, also died one after another on the 13th. Before noon on the 14th, a young woman jumped into the icy Yellow River to commit suicide due to a family dispute, and there was no way to save her. This series of murder and social news, if they don't come, they don't come, but if they come, they don't stop, like the fires in the last month. During the Spring Festival, civil servants work on a</p>
<p>shift basis, leaving one or two people on duty. However, these few people on duty rarely fulfill their responsibilities. A certain leader sits in a public car and pays New Year visits from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day from the first to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, consuming more than 10 gallons of public gasoline every day. Except for transportation vehicles, postal and telecommunications services are all on a shift basis, and there is no efficiency to speak of. On the other hand, entertainment venues are even more lively, and queuing to grab tickets is a rare and wonderful performance. The ice skating competition at Lan Garden on the first and second days of the Lunar New Year also attracted tens of thousands of viewers. Poor people received winter relief funds of over 100,000 yuan, just enough to buy a pound of wheat flour, and spent the year in their caves. The spring breeze has just arrived, the market has not opened, there is no goods in the department store, the price of rice has quietly jumped from 2.5 million to over 3 million, and wheat flour is not willing to lag behind, also jumping from 1 million per 100 kilograms to 1.6 million. Cigarettes, which cannot be without sales for a day, have increased in price by 30%. According to people familiar with the business situation: the market will rise first and then stabilize after opening. As for how much it will rise and then stabilize, this gentleman "looked left and right and spoke of other things." Zhang Zhizhong, the director who stayed in Beijing for five months, suddenly descended from the sky on the 13th. The silver-white "Tianxiong" special plane swept across the azure sky and the white snow-capped mountains, bringing hope and comfort to the welcoming crowd. In the officers' meeting hall, the reporters surrounded the four generals of the Northwest—Zhang Zhizhong, Tao Zhiyue, Guo Jijiao, and Ma Bufang—and took a group photo to commemorate this reunion. As a small article in a newspaper said: "Director Zhang of the Northwest Headquarters has returned, bringing us great excitement and comfort!...Because of him, the Northwest can generate strength and embark on a prosperous road. During the Spring Festival, Director Zhang has returned, which means that 'spring' has come to the Northwest. The Northwest will flourish with the arrival of spring!" The people of the Northwest really hope, hope that Director Zhang is the embodiment of "spring"—(Our Newspaper Reporter Song Binglin)</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong, the director of the Northwest Headquarters, returned to his post and took a group photo with visiting reporters.</p>

<h3>Lanzhou Cultural Work Exhibition Postponed to Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Lanzhou 20th Dispatch] The cultural community liaison meeting hosted by Zhang Zhizhong and the work exhibition of various cultural units of the Headquarters have been postponed to the 21st due to insufficient preparation. More than 230 people from the education, news, art, drama, and music circles have been invited. In addition to a cocktail party, there will be Ping Opera and Henan Opera, as well as the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, which has just returned from Beijing, performing songs and dances, making it an unprecedented event in the Lanzhou cultural circle.</p>
<h3>Wang Yintai Case to Be Retried Soon; Most of the Evidence Sent to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing 20th Dispatch] The case of Wang Yintai, the traitor and former chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, has been returned for retrial by the Supreme Court. The Capital High Court has continued to collect evidence from the north to prepare for a retrial. Most of the materials have now been sent from Beiping to Beijing. Once all the investigations are completed, a date for the trial can be set. According to Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, to our reporter: Regarding the matter of the Executive Yuan passing the resolution to expedite the handling of traitor cases, the court has no difficulty in implementing it. There are currently 64 pending major and minor traitor cases. If the Prosecutor's Office does not file any further lawsuits and the Supreme Court does not return any more cases for retrial, it is hoped that all of them can be concluded by the end of April this year. He personally believes that the Executive Yuan's decision to expedite the handling of traitor cases can indeed promote efficiency. However, whether it is appropriate to end the work of punishing traitors by order and restricting the application of Article 80 of the Criminal Law, which limits the statute of limitations, requires considerable research. Note: The most severe penalty for the crime of treason is the death penalty, and the statute of limitations for prosecution is 20 years.</p>
<h3>Movie Fans: Soviet Teenagers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Gui Sui 19th Dispatch] Two soviet teenagers from Zhangjiakou, Ba Yi, and An Ni, because they were fascinated by movies, ran away together on December 11th of last year and were stopped by the police and brought back. On December 17th, they ran away again to outside Zhangjiakou, wandering for more than a month in the snow-covered grasslands of Chahar Province. They were finally found by An Ni's father in Chongli County on February 15th. Both of them had torn clothes and shoes and looked haggard. They expressed their gratitude for the benevolent and generous spirit of our country's farmers.</p>
<h3>Taihu Lake Clearance Zone Command Posts Merged for Joint Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang 19th Dispatch] The Taihu Lake Clearance Zone Command Post has decided to merge the second and third clearance zones into one, starting today, to facilitate command and prevent bandits from fleeing from one zone to another. The overall responsibility will be taken by Sun Jinming, the commander of the third clearance zone. Yi Zhizhong, the concurrent commander of the second zone, has been reassigned as the concurrent deputy commander. The joint office has now been established, and the command post is still located in Changzhou.</p>
<h3>Military and Civilian Entertainment Fills Gui Sui; Women Quitting Smoking Perform Yangge Dance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Gui Sui 19th Dispatch] Gui Sui has been filled with the sounds of drums and music in recent days. Shops close early. There are still five days until the Lantern Festival, but military and civilian entertainment has already filled the streets. Among them, the "Yangge" dance performed by women from the smoking cessation center is the most eye-catching. They sing and dance, expressing their joy at breaking free from their addiction. Every day, from morning to night, the bustling streets are crowded with people.</p>
<h3>Development of Shennongjia Begins; First Batch of 1,000 Logs Arrive in Wuchang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hankou 20th Dispatch] The work of developing Shennongjia has already begun. 100,000 railroad ties and thousands of timber logs have been cut down. The first batch of nearly 1,000 timber logs has been transported to Wuchang.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Establishes Tea Improvement Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou 20th Dispatch] Zhejiang Province, in order to improve the production and sales of tea and earn foreign exchange, has recently established a Tea Improvement Design Committee, with Pi Zuoqiong, the Director of the Construction Department, as the chairman. They will send people to Beijing to request tea loans as soon as possible and establish a Tea Coordination Association. At the same time, they will still try to be self-reliant to avoid the tragedy of tea merchants going out of business.</p>
<h3>Taipei City Police Department Sets Household Markers; White Background and Black Text in Three Types; Prostitute Houses Tear Them Down As Soon As They're Put Up</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Taipei 16th Dispatch] The City Police Department has recently set three types of household markers, A, B, and C, all with a white background and black text, to be affixed to the doors of each household for identification. Type A includes outstanding citizens, Type B is for foreigners, and Type C is for prostitutes, thieves, etc. According to the police department, this method, which follows the Japanese colonial era, is sufficient to help speed up the solving of cases. However, all prostitute houses are unwilling to post them and tear them down as soon as the police officers leave.</p>
<h3>Yu County Government to Sell Accumulated Grain</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Changshu 19th Dispatch] The price of rice here has suddenly skyrocketed. The black market price of white rice has broken through 2 million yuan per picul. County Magistrate Zhang immediately sent personnel to the market to monitor business. Because the government stipulated a limited price of 1.65 million yuan, but other places frequently reported price increases, all merchants stopped trading and entered a stalemate. Shao Yongbin, Chairman of the Grain Industry Association, in order to maintain the people's food supply, went to the County Government to meet with County Magistrate Zhang to discuss relaxing the limit. After secret discussions, it was decided to raise it to 1.79 million yuan and strictly limit transactions, absolutely not allowing any exceeding of this price, with severe penalties for violators. In addition, the source of supply would be the responsibility of each merchant, and no interruption would be allowed. It is also learned that, in order to maintain people's livelihood and social order, in addition to making every effort to suppress market price fluctuations, the County Government is now planning to sell as much of the county's accumulated grain as possible, in the hope of stabilizing grain prices.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou City Firecracker Industry Merchants Decide to Organize Export Agency</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou 20th Dispatch] Chinese firecrackers have generally aroused the interest of Americans. It is heard that an American merchant has already ordered a large number of firecrackers from Guangzhou firecracker merchants. In order to earn foreign exchange, the firecracker industry in this city has decided to organize a foreign trade agency. If this matter becomes a reality, then China's exports will add a new item.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Businesses Request Exemption from Checking Account Books</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wuxi 19th Dispatch] The Tax Bureau of the county streamlined the collection of business tax. The other day, it sent a large number of people to randomly check the account books of various industries. During the random checks on Beida Street, there was a misunderstanding, and the shops once closed early, which has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the shops that closed on the 19th opened as usual that morning. On that day, the Tax Bureau still sent people to randomly check, but nothing was found. At 3 p.m. on the same day, the County Chamber of Commerce specially convened a meeting of various industries to persuade them to wait for random checks according to the law. All unreported simplified grade registers were to be reported immediately. After the meeting, various industries also convened a joint symposium to exchange opinions. Two points were decided: (1) The business tax for the 36th year has already been paid. How should the business tax for the spring of this year be paid? It was resolved that the County Council had already decided on the number of business taxes in the county budget, and it should be paid according to the determined number. (2) At present, no place in the country has implemented tax assessment by checking accounts. It is inconvenient for Wuxi to be unique. How should this be expressed? It was resolved that the Chamber of Commerce should petition the government to stop random checks, so as not to affect the business market. If this cannot be resolved within a month, it is feared that it will affect the county's finances. Therefore, there is talk of the County Council taking the lead.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Wharf Workers Dispute; Liu Jianxu Sends Personnel to Mediate; If Necessary, Allow Unemployed Soldiers to Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou 20th Dispatch] The dispute between the Chen and Wu workers in Xiamen over the docks has not yet stopped. Chairman Liu of Fujian Province is very concerned about this. Because Xiamen is a place for international observation, there should never be such feudal barriers. He has specially sent Huang Duqi, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Secretariat, to investigate and deal with the matter. If necessary, he will open the wharves there and transfer them to unemployed soldiers.</p>
<h3>Major Robbery Occurs in Chebudong, Changzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wujin 19th Dispatch] In Kangjiatang Village, about half a mile east of the train station in this county, at around 11 p.m. on the 17th, Kang Bingyang, Bingwen, and their uncle Kang Rongfu's families were suddenly attacked by more than a dozen plainclothes bandits wearing black clothes, many of whom were holding flashlights and long and short weapons. They climbed over the wall into the inner rooms, prohibiting the victims from making any noise, and ransacked and plundered at will. After two hours, they shouted and carried the stolen goods away towards Tianning Temple. Afterwards, the three families inspected their losses and found that gold rings, jewelry, and other items worth more than 200 million yuan had been stolen, making it an unprecedented major robbery. The police have been notified and are investigating.</p>
<h3>European Travelogue (4)</h3>
<p>— Li Hanhun</p>
<p>Visiting the Labor Party</p>
<p>Together with Zhaolun, I visited the Transport House of the Labor Party and spoke with its representatives for almost two hours. Initially, Jufang asked about women's issues: Question: What is the Labor Party's policy towards women? Answer: After the Labor Party came to power, it actively improved its policy towards women. To summarize:</p>
<p>(1) The Labor Party strives to increase and improve employment opportunities for women and the facilities needed by women workers, such as nurseries, canteens, and restrooms. As a result, the number of female workers has now increased by about one million.</p>
<p>(2) Women's wages and benefits were previously lower than those of men, usually about 30% lower, except for doctors and writers. The law now stipulates equal treatment. However, due to the country's economic difficulties, it has not been possible to pay it in full for the time being.</p>
<p>(3) Pregnant women, new mothers, and children under the age of five are provided with special nutrition by the state, such as milk, orange juice, cod liver oil, and vitamins. The mortality rate has already decreased. Vitamins and other nutrients are also provided to children over the age of five, and it is expected that they will all be provided in two years.</p>
<p>(4) The National Insurance Act has been passed by the Parliament and will be implemented next year. At that time, everyone will receive a food allowance of five cents a day, and families with more than one child will receive state subsidies.</p>
<p>(5) The National Medical Service Act will also be implemented next year. Doctors will be state-owned, and all the needs of doctors will be provided by the state. Health service stations will be established everywhere, with several doctors in each station, providing free medical care to the people. The expenses of the service stations will be provided by the factories. Infants will be divided into two groups, before and after the age of four, and will be regularly checked by state doctors.</p>
<p>Question: Do British women prefer family life or social life? What is the average family size?</p>
<p>Answer: Most British women prefer family life, but the poor have to go out to work due to the pressure of life. After the war, young women prefer social work. The government's social service agencies have rotating female workers to assist mothers and patients, but most women are unwilling to take on this job. The average British family has four people, i.e., two husband and wife and two children. Rural or poor families have more people. The birth rate after the war is higher than before the war.</p>
<p>Question: Are educational opportunities for women equal to those for men?</p>
<p>Answer: The British education system requires compulsory primary education from the age of five to eleven and secondary education from the age of eleven to fifteen. Each level can also participate in the matriculation examination through self-study. Passing the matriculation examination allows one to go to school, but the entrance examination to university is quite strict, and not many people can go to university. There are currently 80,000 university students nationwide, and women account for more than 2,500.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A on women's issues ended here. Jufang left early because she had something to do. I continued to talk to them: Question: Can you tell me about the important measures and effects of the Labor Party after it came to power?</p>
<p>Answer: The ultimate goal of the Labor Party is economic equality, while maintaining political freedom. The biggest weaknesses of capitalism in the past were: one was monopoly, two was inequality, and three was the number of unemployed. The Labor Party's current policy is to address these three weaknesses in order to achieve a national phenomenon of no monopoly, no inequality, and no unemployment. Its important measures are:</p>
<p>(1) Important industries such as coal, electricity, steel, transportation, and banks are all state-owned. Some of them have already been implemented, and some are in preparation.</p>
<p>(2) The implementation of new laws such as the National Insurance Act and the National Doctor Service Act, and the increase in income tax, inheritance tax, etc., make the people's economy more equal and the standard of living gradually improved.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the people's employment problem, there are new plans and laws. The current unemployment rate is only 2%, and we will further reduce unemployment and even eliminate unemployment.</p>
<p>Question: After the state-owned enterprises, has the efficiency increased or decreased?</p>
<p>Answer: The national output in the most recent year has increased by 5% compared to the previous year, and the coal industry is the most significant. The biggest reason is that workers would rather be employed by the state than by private individuals. In addition, workers can participate in management, which is not only in line with the principle of economic democracy, but also can reasonably increase efficiency.</p>
<p>Question: Since the output is gradually increasing, why is the general standard of living still declining? Is there any concern that this will lead to dissatisfaction among the people and be taken advantage of by the opposition party?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the current goal is to increase the total output, the income is mostly used for equipment and business expansion, and it has not been possible to increase the standard of living for the time being, but it is still being gradually improved. The sugar and food supplies are increasing daily, and we believe that the plan can be completed in 1950. The opposition party is not very clever, and even less can there be any miracles. We firmly believe that the Labor Party will be supported by the people.</p>
<p>Question: Is there any concern that the wealth of the rich will flee the country?</p>
<p>Answer: The government manages it strictly, and the banks are also state-owned, so it is difficult to flee the country. Moreover, the state has not denied private property, and there is no need to flee the country in principle.</p>
<p>Question: Can the Labor Party's current policies achieve the path to true economic equality? Answer: The Labor Party's current policies are to ensure that the people of the whole country have no fear of poverty, no fear of insecurity, and no fear of inequality in the economy. The British are a practical nation. To meet and apply our practical requirements, we are moving in this direction in order to achieve a bloodless social revolution. After the Q&amp;A, the representatives gave me many reference materials. Then I went to their book supply department to buy several reference books. To my surprise, after walking more than two blocks, the old woman who sold the books hurried to catch up, saying that she had miscalculated and overcharged me by two and a half cents. She asked me to wait so that she could go and get it and send it to me, or go back with her to collect it. Because she was afraid that she would not be able to catch up in time when she discovered it, she did not bring it with her. I immediately went back with her to retrieve it, and the old woman apologized repeatedly. Zhaolun laughed and said, "This is why the British are the British."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Incentives for Afforestation of Barren Mountains</h3>

(3) Afforestable barren mountains will be exempt from taxes in the afforestation area for 30 years from the start of afforestation. (4) If people engaging in afforestation of barren mountains lack sufficient funds, they may apply to county and city governments to introduce loans from the China Farmers Bank or other financial institutions.

<p>Rugged Road: A day trip to scenic spots in the suburbs of London, completed. After discussing several important issues with friends, I sat in meditation and developed a strong interest in British history and the current policies of the Labor Party. The following is a passage from the diary at the time, appended here as a conclusion to the impressions of visiting England.</p>
<p>In the mid-Middle Ages, when European countries were still engaged in their cruel religious wars, Great Britain had already begun its royal political reforms; at the beginning of modern times, when European countries were still engaged in their struggles to end feudal remnants, the Kingdom of Great Britain had already begun its industrial revolution. Escaping the scourge of several European wars, accepting the philosophical ideas and scientific inventions of various European countries since the Renaissance, the Anglo-Saxon nation, quietly residing on the three islands, has advanced in politics, economy, and culture in separate directions for seven or eight hundred years. Therefore, since the eighteenth century, the British flag has been planted all over the world, earning the reputation of the "Empire on which the sun never sets" and the "Lord of the Seas." This capitalist British culture has been boasting to the world for as long as two hundred years.</p>
<p>The cycle of rise and fall is a natural principle. When capitalist culture shone brightly in England, flaws were also revealed at the same time. In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the number of chimneys in England was the highest in the world, but its slums were also famous at the time. In order to resolve labor-capital conflicts, British thinkers proposed several solutions to practical problems. Moderate socialism, Fabianism, and Guild Socialism are all representative of such solutions.</p>

<h3>Eastern Science Cooperation Office Establishes Office in Shanghai to Assist in Promoting Engineering Education in China</h3>
<p>[United Nations Office in Shanghai Dispatch] The Science Department of the League of Nations Educational Organization has dispatched Mr. Schmuder (Czech) to China to establish the Eastern Science Cooperation Office in Nanjing in order to facilitate scientific cooperation with the organization's Far East member states (China and the Philippines). The office has now been established at 671 North Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, and Mr. Schmuder is temporarily serving as the director.</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reached an agreement with the Chinese Ministry of Education and the League of Nations Educational Organization to continue the program through the Eastern Science Cooperation Office, which necessitated the establishment of a separate office in Shanghai. The Shanghai office is now located in the United Nations Building at 106 Huangpu Road (telephone 40070, extensions 27 and 52). The engineering education program includes basic training equipment worth more than US$2 million, which will be distributed to 35 public and private engineering schools in China. These schools are located in 19 cities from Peiping to Guangzhou and currently have approximately 20,000 students. This program will make a significant contribution to educating China's future technicians and participating in China's industrialization. Professor Klever, who was previously responsible for this program at UNRRA, has now joined UNESCO and is in charge of the Shanghai office to continue the program. Mr. Klever previously served as UNRRA's North China Industrial Relief Officer for two years.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Solemnly Declares That No Six Principles Have Been Established for Improving Normal School Education</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The Ministry of Education has implemented three plans for normal school education before and after the war and issued them to various provinces and cities for implementation. Recently, some newspapers have mistakenly published the matters discussed at the meeting of educational and academic groups as the Ministry of Education's "Six Principles for Improving Normal School Education."

<p>[Our City Dispatch] The Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating that the report in the Dahua Daily of February 13 from Nanjing, "Ministry of Education Decides on Six Principles for Improving Normal School Education," contains statements such as normal school students must serve in education for at least ten years, etc. The Ministry of Education has made plans to promote the development of national normal school education over the years and has not separately established the above six principles, which does not conform to the facts.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Department Meeting Discusses Adjusting the Powers of Various Departments and Sections, Affiliation of Normal Schools to Undergo Changes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The Ministry of Education has been holding department meetings for several days to discuss and propose amendments to the "Ministry of Education Internal Regulations" in the "Ministry of Education Organization Law." This "Internal Regulations" includes the responsibilities of various departments, offices, and sections of the Ministry of Education. It is heard that the responsibilities of the higher education, secondary education, national education, social education, and frontier education departments and sections will all be adjusted. One of the important points is that the affiliation of normal education will be changed in order to link the training of teachers with the service of schools. That is, the normal colleges under the jurisdiction of the Higher Education Department will be transferred to the Secondary Education Department, and the secondary normal schools under the jurisdiction of the Secondary Education Department will be transferred to the National Education Department. Because graduates of higher normal colleges are secondary school teachers, and graduates of secondary normal schools are national school teachers, this can strengthen the connection. The results of this discussion will be implemented after the minister's approval and after going through the necessary procedures.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball League: Qingbai Meets Chenyou; Green Forest Juniors Battle Jianle</h3>
<p>The Third Basketball League will feature one match each in Group A1 and Group A2 starting at 6:30 PM today, still held in the gymnasium of the Municipal Stadium. Tickets are 20,000 yuan upstairs and 40,000 yuan downstairs. Today's schedule is listed below:</p>
<p>Green Forest - Jianle (Group A2) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Qingbai - Chenyou (Group A1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>In the first match, Green Forest in Group A2 will face Jianle. The former has won all four matches in the group and is determined to win the sub-group championship. Under continuous practice, the entire team has abundant stamina and is young and strong. Furthermore, team leaders Ye Yunshan and Chen Zhengmiao have made great progress in their skills since traveling to Nanjing and Hangzhou with the Dagong Team. They have been influenced by the famous players of Dagong and are known as "Little Dagong." Their style is similar to that of Qunsheng. The entire team is in peak condition and will give their all in the fight for the championship against Jianle today. Jianle's players are all veterans who have been active in the basketball world for many years. Chen Yong'an, Zhou Jun, Chen Zuoliang, Zhang Xianlun and others are experienced and have won two consecutive victories since their debut. They also harbor ambitions to win the sub-group championship. However, due to work commitments, the players have neglected practice. Against the young and strong Green Forest, Green Forest has a higher chance of victory.</p>
<p>In the Group A1 match, Qingbai will compete against Chenyou. Under the leadership of veterans Cai Yanxiong, Wang Nanzhen, and Tang Baokun, Qingbai's ball skills and techniques are superb. They also demonstrated their power in the recent match against the American military police after returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou to participate in charity matches. Chen Xianglong and young player Wang Junbing performed brilliantly. However, national player Wang Nanzhen has returned to his hometown and has not yet returned to Shanghai. Against Chenyou today, there is no need to worry, as there are still many strong players. Chenyou was originally a strong team in Group A1. However, after suffering a crushing defeat in two matches against Enkas recently, they have buried themselves in hard practice. Wang Rongsheng, the main player in Danyang, may arrive on time today. Once they meet Qingbai, a fierce battle is inevitable.</p>
<p>(Qingbai) Cai Yanxiong, Zhang Shaoqing, Zheng Yaoya, Xu Heng, Wang Nanzhen, Tang Baokun, Zhou Dayun, Chen Xianglong, Zhuo Guorong.</p>
<p>(Chenyou) He Zeng, Chuan Qixia, Wang Rongsheng, Wang Bingfu, Shi Jiuquan, Zhang Bingqian, Ji Youkun, Wan Bai, Bao Daohui.</p>

<p>Yarn Prices See Mixed Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened in the morning with higher prices for yarn from the Textile Construction Company, further boosted by the increase in foreign exchange rates, which boosted confidence. Various stalls opened at higher prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn touched the 80 million yuan mark. Later, as the Textile Construction Company suspended quotations again at high prices, the confidence of the industry turned weak, and the closing price fell slightly. However, the result was still an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. Throughout the day, the price of 21-count Double Horse spot yarn was under pressure from sellers, once reaching the 50 million yuan mark. However, due to the large number of those offsetting positions, it remained at the previous day's price of 51.5 million yuan. 16-count and other coarse yarns saw small trading volumes, and the prices of other counts of yarn saw mixed fluctuations.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices Stop Falling and Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially opened with a downward trend, as the Textile Construction Company released a large number of cloth pieces, ample funds, tight positions among traders, and retail investors successively cutting losses, while strong players vomited at high prices. However, after 10:00 AM, as foreign exchange rates rose and cotton yarn prices increased again, merchants from the Yangtze River area frequently increased their purchases, and dyeing factories also came to buy. Short positions rose to offset, and the market suddenly became tight, with prices stopping their decline and rebounding. As a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths rose by 40,000 to 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge also rebounded strongly, and the market sentiment for other cloths also turned firm.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Prices Trend Upwards</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market continued to rebound, with a bullish trend. Traders competed to buy, and market prices rose steadily. Cotton merchants and the Yarn Control Association signed agreements to purchase cotton, all requiring physical collateral. Therefore, traders all stored spot goods, resulting in strong buying interest and increased demand in the market. The future market is still expected to rise. 898 bales were traded throughout the day. The factory delivery price for 100 bales of Shashi cotton was 9.507 million yuan, and the warehouse delivery price for Kaisha cotton was 8.765 million to 9.176 million yuan, and for Han fine cotton was 8.1 million to 8.35 million yuan, with 798 bales traded.

<h3>Cigarettes and Soap See Lower Prices</h3>

Chinese-made strip cigarettes such as Mice and Three Cats saw only small increases, while the rest were stable. However, the prices of American-made Morris and 50-count Capric Three-Five brand cigarettes fell.

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Due to Scarce Arrivals Caused by Rain: Unregistered Rice Shops and Bureaus Stop Sales</h3>

Registered arrivals in the southern market were 1,371 stone and 8 dou, and only 70 stone in the northern market, including 55 stone of white yuan and 15 stone of dark yuan. Off-market prices continued to rise. The Social Affairs Bureau sold 10,925 stone to 1,698 rice shops in the city market at a price of 1.75 million yuan in the past two days. From today onwards, the Social Affairs Bureau does not intend to supply rice to rice shops without a grain merchant registration license.</p>
<p>Also, it has been reported that rice prices are rising slowly. Fortunately, the continuous supply of rice from the community bureaus can meet market demand, so although prices have risen, they have not risen excessively. Yesterday, a small amount of coarse indica rice opened at 1.95 million yuan plus commission in the southern market. The off-market supply was still small. White japonica rice continued to rise to 2.2 million yuan, thin rice to 2.15 million yuan, and early rice to 2.1 million yuan, each rising by about 50,000 yuan. The community bureaus distributed rice according to the method of the previous day, distributing about 10,950 stone. There was no white yuan rice distributed, and the off-market price reached 2.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>As the opening price of wheat from small factories has risen to 1.4 million yuan, raw materials have become expensive, and costs have naturally increased. Furthermore, as Wuxi prices are not low, cargo owners are still trying to raise prices, and various flours have risen again. Old Car flour broke through the 1 million yuan mark, reaching 1.02 million yuan. Bingchuan flour also reached the 1 million yuan mark. Red Bee and Jiancheng are hovering around the 1 million yuan mark. Wheat bran rose again by 45,000 yuan. Large bags of wheat bran were once 690,000 yuan, and then 670,000 yuan. Small bags of wheat bran were 450,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Continued to climb to higher peaks. Soybean prices have risen because oil factories and customers are purchasing them, and the retail market on this street is also active. Hankou bean price is 1.4 million yuan, an increase of about 50,000 yuan. Pinghu extra-coarse beans opened as high as 1.8 million yuan, an increase of about 150,000 yuan, due to reduced arrivals. Selected Qing Xilu goods had scarce arrivals and a low price level, but rose sharply by 200,000 yuan yesterday.

<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Initially weak and then rose. The closing price of soybean oil was similar to the previous day, and crude oil rose by 50,000 yuan. The market trend for both was very strong. Initially, as the price had risen too much on the previous day, many recycled goods were released at high prices. Factory soybean oil once fell to 4.68 million yuan. Upon hearing that the price in Wuxi was not low, cargo owners were reluctant to sell, and the price of miscellaneous grains rose. Taking the opportunity, many stores purchased it, and the price rebounded again. Finally, Da Youyu soybean oil reached 4.8 million yuan again. Jilong crude oil initially traded at 5.2 million yuan, and then rose to 5.3 million yuan in the aftermarket, an increase of 50,000 yuan. Initially, there were few transactions in raw sesame oil.

<h3>Taiwan's Textile Industry: The Jute Textile Industry Has a Thicker Foundation - A Chat with Wu Weijing After His On-the-Spot Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, flew to Taiwan on February 7th to negotiate the purchase of Taiwan's yellow jute seeds and to inspect the textile industry in the province. He returned to Shanghai on the 19th after completing his official duties. He told our reporter: "Among Taiwan's textile industries, the jute textile industry has a relatively solid foundation. This is because the province's two special products, sugar and rice, require 15 million jute bags annually. The cotton textile equipment was dismantled and moved to Taiwan by the Japanese after the Pacific War. Currently, there are 29,000 yarn spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 104,000 spindles. However, the operating efficiency is only 7,000 spindles. Taiwan Province needs about 50,000 bales of cotton yarn annually. To meet this demand, equipment with 100,000 yarn spindles is required. Therefore, Taiwan Province currently needs 90% of its cotton yarn to be supplied by other provinces. However, Taiwan Province has excellent conditions for establishing cotton mills, such as: (1) Taichung has an exceptionally good climate. (2) Electricity is cheap, at NT$40 per unit. (3) Labor is cheap, with an average monthly wage of NT$15,000 per person. (4) Workers have strict discipline."</p>
<p>Regarding textile raw materials, the annual production of yellow jute is currently 30,000 dan (a unit of weight), ramie is 13,000 dan, and flax production is relatively small. The annual production of cotton is 2,000 dan. The annual production of silk is over 300 zu (a unit). Among the economic values of various textile raw materials, yellow jute is the highest. Therefore, the Taiwan Provincial Government is actively promoting yellow jute. This time, the Textile Construction Company purchased 270 dan of yellow jute seeds in Taiwan and will promote it near Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Regarding textile equipment, there are 21,000 yarn spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 14,000 spindles. There are 2,500 looms, with an actual operating capacity of 500 looms. There are 5,400 jute spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 4,800 spindles. There are 3,400 jute looms, with an actual operating capacity of 2,400 looms. There are 850 woolen spindles, with an actual operating capacity of 200 spindles. There are 25 silk units. There are over 10,000 cotton spinning machines, with 30,000 units in operation.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Commodity Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent in Wuxi, 20th] Commodity prices here continue to skyrocket today, causing a comprehensive price surge. Speculators in the market whisper among themselves, creating an atmosphere of a black market. Rice and grain are scarce due to rain preventing cotton delivery, and demand from merchants is strong, creating a situation of supply falling short of demand. Early trading prices for white japonica rice opened at 2,090,000, rising to 2,140,000; white yuan rice at 2,270,000; sheep indica rice at 873,000; wharf rice at 856,000; yuan rice at 955,000; wheat at 2,750,000; white wheat at 2,800,000; flour at 1,050,000; soybean oil at 5,000,000; cotton yarn at 52,000,000.</p>
<p>New External Stimulus Arises, Chinese Stocks Revolve and Improve. Yesterday, with even more abundant funds in the Chinese stock market, external stimulus emerged at the right time.

Compared to the morning closing, domestically produced stocks Huafeng rose by 0.5%, Yong Yarn, Tongyi, Commerce, Match, Jingfu, Qinxing, Underwear, China France, New China, and Xinnuo saw slight increases, New Light, National Goods, Li An, and Yong Gong were flat, and Zhabei and Rongfeng saw slight decreases. Deferred delivery stocks Huafeng rose by slightly less than 0.5%, Qinxing saw a slight increase, Xinnuo remained flat, and the remainder saw slight decreases. Off-market, unlisted stocks in general, utility stocks were slightly weak, cultural stocks were stable, and the remainder were flat.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Mostly Arbitrage Purchases, Foreign Stocks Rise Generally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bond transactions were mostly arbitrage purchases. Ding and Wu bonds were relatively stable. Unified Class C opened at 80,000 yuan, with a low of 76,000 yuan and a high of 81,000 yuan, before ending with a stalemate. Compared to the previous closing, Classes A, B, and C fell by 2,000 yuan, Ding and Wu were flat, and the trading volume was approximately 2 million yuan. After the exchange rate adjustment, the market listing of foreign stocks and the rise of new outside stimulus, resulted in increased buying and considerable increases in popular stocks. Yish yarn opened in the morning at 730,000, and rose to a new closing high of 820,000. Retail investors provided the supply, and securities dealers and foreign merchants bought in. Compared to the previous closing, telephone stocks had supply failing to meet demand and had the greatest rise. Yish yarn, British Federation, Yish beer, and Steel all rose more than 10%, Jardine Matheson, Yeh Kong, and Paper rose 0.5%, and Tram and Rubber stocks were mediocre.</p>
<h3>Prevent Price Increases, Continue to Tighten Money Supply</h3>
<p>The government, seeing commodity prices rise again after the red market, has decided to tighten the money supply to curb this trend. It will continue to adopt the methods of distributing and selling materials to bring legal tender back into circulation. The government agencies in charge of materials have already discussed this carefully and began to take further action on the 19th. Therefore, there has been a large difference in prices in the past few days, amounting to more than 500 billion. It is expected that when the price difference reaches 3 trillion, the money supply will be extremely tight, and commodity prices will fall and stabilize. Materials for distribution include yarn, cloth, sugar, oil, salt, and rayon. Rice and oil will be sold off. The current surge in commodity prices is due to the influx of idle funds from various regions after the New Year, with North China accounting for 70-80%. The idle funds in North China flow in from the Northeast, with North China only serving as a transit point. Shanghai is the final destination for these idle funds, so commodity prices are the first to be affected. The government's tightening of the money supply is only a temporary solution, and it is said that fundamental solutions will be addressed.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Commodity Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent in Xi'an, 20th] Under the manipulation of idle funds, commodity prices in Xi'an continue to rise daily, especially for cigarettes and cloth. Yesterday alone, cigarettes rose by 3-4 million per case, and cloth prices also rose from 39 million to 41 million. Judging from the prosperous trading situation in the market, the price surge is likely to continue.</p>
<h3>Bright Prospects for the Tea Market</h3>
<p>In recent days, although the color and pattern of red silk tea have been the subject of intense negotiations, the stocks of each type of tea remain scarce, and sellers are holding out for high prices. As a result, both sides are still in a standoff, and the trading environment remains gloomy. However, there is still considerable potential. According to intermediaries, buying interest from Suzhou and surrounding areas has been quite strong recently, especially for mid-range black tea. Overall, the prospects for the tea market seem increasingly bright.</p>
<h3>Tea Association Cables Request for Opening of Tea Loans</h3>
<p>The entire board of directors of the China Tea Industry Association, on the 20th, requested the government to expedite the tea loan program, following the example of silk loans, and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, and other relevant authorities, requesting that the price of each dan of tea be set at the standard of exchanging it for three dan of rice. The amount of advance funds for agriculture and commerce should be limited to 10%. It is also requested that half of the prescribed loan limit be allocated to the China Agricultural Loan and the other half to the Central Cooperative Treasury and provincial banks in each province for lending to tea merchants, tea farmers, and tea production cooperatives in various regions. The agencies are also responsible for guaranteeing principal and interest, increasing production, and helping the government promote exports, stabilize people's livelihoods, and curb the source of unrest.</p>
<h3>Official Transfer of Treasury Funds; Receipts Exempt from Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the question of whether formal receipts for remittances of treasury funds should be affixed with stamp duty, the Direct Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance recently explained that: "Vouchers issued by governments or autonomous agencies at all levels for handling treasury funds or public funds shall be exempt from stamp duty by law. Formal receipts for remittances of treasury funds shall be exempt from stamp tax if the remittance is for the transfer of expenses by various agencies to their subordinates, or for the travel expenses of officials on business trips. However, receipts for the remittance of salaries and benefits to officials on business trips, and for the remittance of procurement fees to direct creditors, shall still be subject to stamp duty in accordance with the law." It is reported that the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has issued a circular to all branches for compliance.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Strengthen</h3>
<p>In the market for industrial raw materials, due to the dwindling supply and decreasing inventories, demand is strong from all sides, and market prices are exceptionally strong. Furthermore, due to the increase in the US dollar exchange rate, people are even more anxious. The price of monthly branded soda ash continues to rise by one million yuan, to 63 million yuan per barrel. Purchases of American soda ash by the soap industry are brisk, rising by two million, to 61 million yuan. In addition, small quantities of soda, glycerin, bleaching powder essence, red potassium powder, and zinc oxide powder have also increased by more than 10%.</p>
<h3>Timber Turns Firm</h3>
<p>The timber market, which has been sluggish for some time since the New Year, improved yesterday due to exchange rate adjustments, and the market price of fir timber is trending upward.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Deposits in Banks and Financial Institutions for December of Last Year</h3>
<p>The National Bank's Audit Department recently released statistics on the total amount of deposits and reserve funds in banks and financial institutions nationwide for December, as follows: Current deposits: 3,883,059,871,542.60 yuan; Time deposits: 635,985,564,691.77 yuan; Total deposits: 4,519,045,436,234.37 yuan; Reserve funds paid in: 640,385,049,591.00 yuan.</p>

<h3>Examination of the Reign Title "Zhenghe" of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Xia Nai</p>
<p>The character "zheng" in the reign title "Zhenghe" of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty is written as 『　』 or 『延』 in the Han bamboo slips excavated from Juyan. Mr. Fu Zhenlun said: Mr. Ma Shuping interpreted it as the character "yan"; Emperor Wu's reign title was originally "Yanhe" (the same "yan" as in Juyan and Yanshou). Later generations transcribed it incorrectly, taking "yan" as "zheng," which has been followed to this day without correction (see "The Yanhe Reign Title of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty," Archaeological Society Journal, Sixth Issue). This new theory is based on new materials and sounds appealing at first. However, after careful examination, it is clear that Mr. Fu's theory is untenable.</p>
<p>Emperor Wu's reign title was originally Zhenghe. The character on the Han bamboo slips is a variant form of the character "zheng." The Zhenghe reign title appears ten times in the Juyan bamboo slips (Mr. Fu claims twelve times. However, bamboo slips No. 534, part 2 and 15, are one slip broken into two pieces, and the characters Zhenghe only appear once. This reign title is not seen in Section 16 of the eighth bamboo slip). These ten characters "zheng" all consist of "zheng" and "chuo." However, sometimes the upper part of the "chuo" character is below the "zheng" character, like Type A in Illustration 1, appearing six times; sometimes it is placed on the right side of the "zheng" character, like Type B in the illustration, appearing four times. As for the characters Juyan, Yuanyan, Yanshou, Yannan, etc., they all appear in the Juyan Han bamboo slips. Especially the two characters Juyan appear together more than three hundred times. I spent several days comparing all 362 occurrences of the character "yan" in Mr. Lao Zhenyi's "Explanations and Interpretations of Juyan Han Bamboo Slips" with the photographs of the original objects (this number may have slight discrepancies; but even if there are one or two omissions, it is not important). The results of the examination show that over 93% of them consist of "yan" and "ノ," like the "usual form" of the "yan" character in Illustration 1; occasionally, the "yin" character is written below the "zhi" character, but this is very rare, only 20 bamboo slips, accounting for 6% of the total; and its first stroke is always oblique, like the "variant form" of the "yan" character in Illustration 1. The side radical of the character "yan" can be written so casually because the characters "chuo," "chi," and "yin" in ancient writing were actually different ways of writing the same character (see Luo Zhenyu's "Interpretation of the Chapter on Xing," in "Collected Works of the Old Man Zhen Song," Series A, Hou Dingwu Manuscript). Although they were differentiated in the Han Dynasty, with "yan" consisting of "yin" and "zheng" mostly consisting of "chi" or "chuo," it was not yet very strict. The most important distinction between the characters "zheng" and "yan" is whether the topmost stroke is tilted or horizontal. Most interestingly, in Juyan bamboo slip No. 557-8, "Zhenghe fourth year... Yanshou, the head of the Juyan agricultural post" (Lao's Interpretation, Volume 2, page 70). Although several parts of the original bamboo slip are slightly blurred, the characters "zheng" and "yan" are still very clear. It can be seen that the topmost stroke of the character "zheng" is horizontal, which is different from the slanted first stroke of the character "yan" (see Illustration 2).</p>
<p>Now we will use philology and exegesis to examine this issue. Shuowen Jiezi, the "chuo" radical: Yan, meaning to walk upright, consists of "chuo" and the sound "zheng." Sometimes it consists of "chi," written as zheng (Volume 2). It is known that these two characters are actually two ways of writing the same character. Luo Zhenyu said: For characters consisting of "chi," the ancient writing sometimes added "zhi" below "chi" to form "chuo"; for characters consisting of "chuo," it was also sometimes abbreviated to "chi." Luo also quoted Shuowen and oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions as evidence to show that the two were actually the same character. Xu Shen mistakenly distinguished them, defining "chi" as a small step, resembling the connection of the three parts of a person's leg; defining "chuo" as walking and stopping. This is entirely based on looking at the shape and interpreting the meaning. Looking at the characters in the "chuo" radical, which one has the connotation of "walking and stopping"? (See Luo Zhenyu's "Interpretation of the Chapter on Xing.") Shuowen Jiezi, the "yin" radical, says: Yan, meaning to walk; consists of "yin" and the sound "zheng" (Volume 2). Although Shuowen places this character separately, upon closer examination, it is actually the same character as "zheng" and "yan." As shown in Illustration 1, in the seal script, "yin" and "chi" are very similar. Luo Zhenyu said: The "yin" in the "yin" radical, written in seal script as 个　, did not exist in ancient writing. Only the ancient character "chi" was sometimes written as 　 or 　, which is one character with slightly different ways of writing, not two characters. Luo also cited the "zheng" characters in the Ehou Yufang Ding and Wu Yi Dun bronze inscriptions as evidence, inferring that the "yan" character in the "yin" radical in Shuowen was actually the same character as the "yan" and "zheng" in the "chuo" radical. (See Luo Zhenyu's "Interpretation of the Chapter on Xing.") In Han Dynasty steles, "yan" is also often written as "延," for example, in the Huashan Temple Stele, the Shi Chen Later Stele, and the Wu Gulang Stele. It can be seen that "yin" and "chuo" were actually interchangeable at that time. As for the character "yan" in Juyan, Shuowen places it in the "yan" radical, consisting of "yan" and the sound "ノ," meaning to walk for a long time (Volume 2). The sound is different from the character "zheng" and its variant forms, and the meaning is also different. Later generations probably gradually used the character "zheng" consisting of "chi" exclusively because the variant form of the character "zheng" could easily be confused with the character "yan." As a result, not only was the character "zheng" consisting of "yin" abandoned, but also the character "zheng" consisting of "chuo" was no longer used.</p>
<p>In terms of textual criticism of ancient books, it also helps to solve this problem. In the Book of Han, regarding the Zhenghe reign title, Wang Shaolan said:</p>
<p>"Examining the 'Table of Princes and Kings' in the Book of Han, 'zhenghe' is used five times; in the 'Table of Princes' it is used nine times; in the 'Table of High Officials of Emperor Gao, Empress Gao, Emperor Wen, and Emperor Gong' it is used twice for 'zhenghe' and once for 'yanhe'; in the 'Table of Meritorious Officials of Emperor Jing, Emperor Wu, Emperor Zhao, Emperor Xuan, Emperor Yuan, and Emperor Cheng,' 'yanhe' is used four times (Yan Shigu said 'yan' is also 'zheng'), 'zhenghe' is used eight times, and 'zhenghe' is used once; in the 'Table of Marquises by Grace of Imperial Relatives' 'zhenghe' is used once; in the 'Table of Hundred Officials and Dukes' 'zhenghe' is used twice. The Zhi and Zhuan also all use the character 'zhenghe.'" (Corrections and Supplements to Shuowen Jiezi, Volume 2)</p>
<p>It is not known which version of the Book of Han Mr. Wang based his statement on. In the Beisong Jingyou edition of the Book of Han (in the Hundred-Volume Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories) reprinted by the Commercial Press, all places where Mr. Wang said the character "yan" was used now have the character "yan." In the Qing Dian edition of the Book of Han, only the Pingqu Marquis entry in the "Table of Meritorious Officials of Emperors Jing and Wu" uses the character "yan" consisting of "chuo" because there is a comment below this entry saying "Yan Shigu said 'yan' is also 'zheng.'" The rest of the places are written as "yan" or "zheng." This is because the character "yan" had already fallen out of use when later generations transcribed it, so they were all changed to the character "zheng" for consistency. The Yan Shigu's comment below the Pingqu Marquis entry was retained because if it were also changed to the character "zheng," the comment would become "zheng is also the character zheng," which would not make sense. As for being written as the character "yan," that is due to the similarity in shape leading to error. In the Nanjing Yingzhou Academy edition of the Book of Han reprinted by Jiayetang, almost all the annual tables have been changed to the character "zheng." Only the Pingqu Marquis entry and the subsequent Yagu Marquis entry are written as the character "yan," probably for the same reason. The annual tables are the part of the history book that is relatively easy to overlook, and there is also Shigu's comment, so it was able to preserve this trace. From this, it can be seen that the character "zheng" in Zhenghe in the ancient Book of Han was inconsistent, sometimes consisting of "chi," sometimes consisting of "chuo," and sometimes consisting of "yin." The three were interchangeable in ancient times. The version that Yan Shigu saw had the character "zheng" in the Zhenghe in the Pingqu Marquis entry consisting of "or yin," so the comment said "also the character zheng." Shigu meant to say that the two were interchangeable, not a mistaken character. Later, it was mistakenly written as the character "yan." Now Mr. Fu Zhenlun intends to change Zhenghe to Yanhe. Is he so shocked by the new materials that he has gone astray?</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Lao Zhenyi, has also noticed this problem, but has not been able to solve it. He said: "The Zhenghe bamboo slips are written as Xia　He, and Mr. Ma Shuping said it is the character 'yan.' Now, according to general usage, it is still written as Zhenghe. After all, there is no need to investigate the original meaning of the naming by the ancients. Writing it as Zhenghe makes it clear at a glance that it is a year of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, which is better than writing it as Yanhe." (Collected Works of the Institute of History and Philology, Tenth Volume, Part 2, "Examination of the Failure to Establish a Reign Title After the Later Yuannian of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty," Note 1) But this is not a matter of convenience, but a matter of factual truth. Therefore, I have spared no effort to conduct a detailed examination.</p>
<p>After the initial draft of this article was completed, Mr. Chen Yuanan came to Beijing. I sought his opinion on it. Mr. Chen said: Ying Shao's commentary on the Zhenghe reign title in the Book of Han says: "It means to conquer the four borders and bring peace to the world." Ying was familiar with the anecdotes of the Former Han Dynasty, and his time was only about two hundred years after Zhenghe, so he should not have misread the character "yan" as the character "zheng." Therefore, when I first heard the new theory of the Yanhe reign title, I was suspicious and dared not believe it. Now that I have seen this examination, I can be thoroughly relieved.</p>

<h3>On the History of the Nanzhao Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Xiang Da</p>
<p>—A textual study on the books recording Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty—</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>During the Zong Xian Tong period, there was Fan Chuo's "Man Shu" in ten volumes, and Dou Pang's "Yunnan Bielu" in one volume; during the Xi Zong period, there was Xu Yunwen's "Nanzhao Lu" in three volumes, and Lu Xie's "Yunnan Shizhuang" in one volume. Fan Chuo's book review is at the end of this article. Now, let's briefly talk about the books of Dou Pang and others.</p>
<p>The New Tang Book and the Song History Art and Literature Records both recorded Dou Pang's "Yunnan Bielu" in one volume. Dou Pang replaced Li Shiwang as the Dingbian Jiedushi in the tenth year of Xiantong, but he was greedy and lost the hearts of the people. When the Nanzhao people attacked, Pang fled in fear, and in the eleventh year he was demoted to Si Hu of Kangzhou. It is impossible to verify when he wrote "Yunnan Bielu." The "Examination of Different Records" in Zizhi Tongjian, Dezong Zhenyuan tenth year, quoted a passage from Pang's book, saying, "Zhao Yuanzi registered Yimouxun as the Nanzhao, presumably at his request. The name Nanzhao began from this point on." The Cefu Yuangui recorded that in Zhenyuan, the Tang Dynasty bestowed a gold seal and silver socket on Nanzhao, with the inscription "Zhenyuan Registers Zhao Seal." Nanzhao is the same as Nanguo Dazhao. The Southern Zhao Dehua stele records that in the eleventh year of Tianbao, Geluofeng was a northern vassal of Tubo, "at Dengchuan, registering and announcing Zhao as Zanpu Zhongnan Guo Dazhao." Nanzhao is the same as Nanguo Dazhao, and Zhenyuan registering Nanzhao was just following the old name of Tubo.</p>
<p>Since Qiulong succeeded to the throne in the thirteenth year of Dazhong during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, until the fourth year of Qianfu during the reign of Emperor Xizong, there were almost border violations every year for nearly twenty years. In the fourth year of Qianfu, Qiulong died, and his son Fa was established, and the border intrusions gradually decreased. Xin Dang, the Jiedushi of Lingnan Xidao, often exchanged envoys with Nanzhao. In the sixth year of Qianfu, he sent the patrol officer Xu Yunwen to Yunnan. He arrived at Shanshan City (now Kunming) in February, stayed for seventeen days, and then returned. In June of the first year of Guangming, he also served as the deputy Zongzheng Shaoqing to Li Guinian, the king of Sicao, and sent him to Nanzhao. He did not return to Xichuan until August of the first year of Zhonghe. Yunwen went to Nanzhao twice in three years. His "Nanzhao Lu" in three volumes, as seen in the Tang and Song Art and Literature Records, was probably a summary of his experiences and observations from his two missions. "Nanzhao Lu" was not passed down after the Song Dynasty. The "Examination of Different Records" in the Tang History of Zizhi Tongjian, Emperor Xizong Qianfu fourth year, February, quoted this book, saying, "Nanzhao's other name is Hetuo, and later it also called itself Dafengren." The fact that the Nanzhao state name was also Hetuo or Dafengren was first seen in this book. The explanations of Hetuo and Dafengren are unknown. Mr. Fang Guoyu believed that Hetuo was the transliteration of 　馱羅. He speculated from the 　 rhyme study, which was too much of a detour, and we were a little unsure whether to believe it.</p>
<p>The book "Yunnan Shizhuang" in one volume was written at the same time as Xu Yunwen's "Nanzhao Lu" and is found in the Song History Art and Literature Records. The "Examination of Different Records" in the Tang History of Zizhi Tongjian, Emperor Xizong Guangming first year, May, Zhao Zongzheng returned to Nanzhao, quoted "Yunnan Shizhuang" to correct the date of the Xichuan Jiedushi Chen Jingxuan's mission to Nanzhao, as well as the reasons why Feng You and others gradually became disrespectful. It also said that "Yunnan Shizhuang" did not record the letters between Chen Jingxuan and Yunnan, sometimes calling it Hetuo, and sometimes calling it Dafengren. The Nanzhao state name was first recorded in "Nanzhao Lu" and "Yunnan Shizhuang," so the name Hetuo or Dafengren may have originated during the time of Emperor Xizong. The Song History did not state who wrote "Yunnan Shizhuang." Wen Gong's "Examination of Different Records" believed that it "seems to be Lu Xie's memorial draft." Xie was the prime minister during the time of Emperor Xizong, and Xin Dang and Chen Jingxuan's sending envoys to Nanzhao to allow him to make peace, Xie's claim was the most. Wen Gong said that "Shizhuang" was Xie's memorial draft, which may be true.</p>
<p>The relationship between Nanzhao and the Tang Dynasty was the most complicated during the time of Emperor Yizong. There were almost annual border alerts, especially in the southern part of China, such as Annam and Yongguan. During the Chengtong period, Annam was captured by Nanzhao, and Yongguan was in turmoil. Therefore, troops from the southeast were transferred to garrison Guilin. Eventually, Pang Xun rebelled, which led to the demise of the Tang Dynasty. Therefore, the gains and losses of Annam were of great importance to the Tang Dynasty. Fan Chuo was a person who personally experienced the Nan Zhao attack on Annam. The "Man Shu" he wrote was all materials collected in Annam, and he compiled it in a systematic way. After Huayang Guozhi, the oldest and best existing record of the history and geography of the southwest is Fan Chuo's book.</p>
<p>Fan Chuo's book, as recorded in the New Tang Book and the Song History Art and Literature Records, consists of ten volumes. Fan's origin cannot be verified, and he was an assistant to Cai Xi, the Annam Economic Envoy. In the third year of Xiantong, Xi was ordered to manage Annam. In the winter of that year, Nanzhao launched a large-scale attack, and in the spring of the fourth year, Annam fell. Xi's family died seventy people, and Chuo escaped across the river. The writing of "Man Shu" probably began in Annam, after Cai Xi's failure. Therefore, the last part of the tenth volume of "Man Shu" says:</p>
<p>"Your two officials have recorded the Man border routes, mountains, rivers, cities, towns, the beginning and end of the six Zhao states, the names of various tribes, customs and laws, local products, the names of the six Jian states, and the neighboring tribes, all compiled into ten volumes on January 29th of last year. They were presented at the Jiangkou of Annam Prefecture, attached to Zhang Shouzhong, the Yaya of Xiangzhou." This was probably in the fourth year of Xiantong. In the fifth year of Xiantong, Fan Chuo was appointed Changshi of Kuizhou Dudufu. He reorganized "Man Shu" once again. At the end of the tenth volume of "Man Shu", there is a discussion about the Miao people in the four towns of Qianjing, Ba Xia. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shen Jianshi and Recent Historical Studies</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zumo</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Jianshi passed away on August 2nd of last year, and all who heard of it were deeply saddened. Throughout his life, Mr. Shen devoted himself to academic pursuits, bringing forth the new from the old. His contributions to the development of historical studies in the past two decades were immense and deserve to be recounted. I will discuss this in three aspects:</p>
<p>1.  Organizing the Ming and Qing Archives</p>
<p>The most common difficulties encountered in historical research are fourfold: first, lack of documentary evidence; second, conflicting records; third, divergent legends; and fourth, scattered materials. To overcome these four difficulties, one must first find authentic and abundant historical materials. Only with authentic and abundant materials can new discoveries be made. For example, the official documents of the Qing Dynasty for over two hundred years are excellent resources for studying modern history. However, since the founding of the Republic of China, no one had paid attention to them. In the second year of the Republic (1913), the Ministry of Education established the Historical Museum, which stored archives moved from the Grand Secretariat's warehouse during the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty. However, they were locked away and forgotten by the world after a few years. In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), they were suddenly sold to a paper mill for papermaking. Luo Zhenyu learned of this and spent over ten thousand yuan the following year to buy them back, thus saving them from destruction (as detailed in Wang Jing'an's "Record of the Library in the Warehouse"). In the same year, Peking University had established the Institute of Chinese Studies. President Cai Yuanpei hired Mr. Shen as the director. Mr. Shen, moved by Luo's efforts to purchase the archives, requested Mr. Cai to petition the Ministry of Education to transfer the remaining archives to the Institute for organization. Permission was granted in May of that year, and the transfer began in July. A total of sixty-two wooden crates and one thousand five hundred and two burlap sacks were transported. These included memorials, reimbursement records, proclamations, congratulatory presentations, tribute lists, and submitted essays from the Ming to Qing dynasties, as well as imperial edicts, transcripts, the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination, daily records of the emperor's activities, veritable records, and historical drafts. Consequently, the Ming and Qing Historical Materials Organization Committee was established to begin organizing them. This marked the beginning of academic institutions researching archives. Mr. Shen presided over this effort for several years, and several individuals assisted him. In addition to categorizing and separating the materials by dynasty, compilations were made, such as the "Abstract Compilation of Memorials from the Ministry of War in the Late Ming Dynasty," the "Daily Records of Reimbursement Records from the Nine Reigns of the Qing Dynasty in the Capital and Provinces," and the "Manual of Official Seals of the Qing Dynasty." Among these were valuable historical materials, such as the drafts of the "Veritable Records of Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty," the drafts of the "Veritable Records of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty," and fragments of Ming historical materials, as well as the drafts of the "Sacred Instructions of Emperor Taizong of the Qing Dynasty," all of which were sufficient to supplement omissions in official books and correct errors in official histories.</p>
<p>The archives collected by Peking University were all from the outer court's Grand Secretariat warehouse. The archives from the inner court and palaces of the Qing Dynasty remained in the Forbidden City. In the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), when Puyi was expelled from the palace, the government organized the Qing Imperial Family Aftermath Committee to take over the Forbidden City with personnel from the Ministry of Interior and local government offices to inventory the palace's items. Mr. Shen, along with Mr. Chen Yuan'an, Mr. Li Shizeng, and others, served as committee members. The following year, the Palace Museum was established in October, with two departments: Antiquities and Books. The Library was further divided into the Books and Documents departments, with Mr. Shen presiding over the Documents department. As a result, he concentrated his efforts on organizing the palace archives, opening exhibition rooms in the outer east section to display abstracts. Later, the old archives from the Imperial Clan Court, the Grand Council, and the Qing History Compiling Office were also received and organized in sequence. In the eighteenth year (1929), the Palace Museum was reorganized in February, establishing three departments: Antiquities, Books, and Documents. Mr. Zhang Puquan was appointed director of the Documents department, with Mr. Shen as his deputy. At this time, in addition to categorizing and cataloging the archives, key items were selected and published as "Dang Gu Cong Bian," which was later renamed "Wen Xian Cong Bian." Materials of similar nature were compiled into special publications and printed separately, such as the "Materials on the Three Feudatories" and the "Archives of Literary Inquisitions." Of particular importance were the "Diplomatic Historical Materials of the Jiaqing Reign," the "Diplomatic Historical Materials of the Daoguang Reign," the "Historical Materials of Sino-Japanese Negotiations of the Guangxu Reign," the "Historical Materials of Sino-French Negotiations," and the "Diplomatic Historical Materials of Sino-Japanese Relations of the Xuantong Reign."</p>
<p>After the fifteenth year, the archives in the museum were divided into four categories: palace archives, archives of the Imperial Household Department, archives of the Grand Secretariat's warehouse, and archives of the Grand Council. In September of the eighteenth year, the old archives of the Ministry of Justice were also received. In the spring of the twentieth year (1931), the East and West Warehouses were reorganized, and the full extent of these ancient documents, locked away for over two hundred years, became known to the world. In July of the twenty-third year (1934), Mr. Ma Shuping became the director of the Palace Museum, and Mr. Shen served as the director of the Documents department. He believed that the previous organization methods still had shortcomings:</p>
<p>(1) Too much emphasis was placed on form, focusing only on distinguishing objects and arranging them chronologically, while neglecting the content of the archives.</p>
<p>(2) Attention was only paid to the archives themselves, neglecting the research on the functions of government offices and document procedures, resulting in the loss of connection between various types of archives.</p>
<p>(3) Too much emphasis was placed on searching for valuable historical materials, while neglecting the general organization of numerous ordinary materials.</p>
<p>Therefore, a new plan was proposed to eliminate the old problems, focusing all efforts on general organization. The archives stored in various places were cross-referenced, and attention was paid to exploring the historical evolution of the archives. The existing historical materials were divided into several groups, first categorized by name, and then cataloged by category. Detailed rules were formulated, abandoning the old parallel classification method and creating a systematic classification method (as detailed in Mr. Shen's "Report on the Organization of Archives in the Documents Department of the Palace Museum" in the twenty-fourth year). At that time, in addition to compiling and printing various historical materials, catalogs of the Grand Council archives, compilations of old archives stored in the Grand Secretariat's warehouse, and general catalogs of memorials not recorded in the "Yongzheng Emperor's Vermilion Endorsements," as well as illustrated catalogs of the Imperial Household Department's Office of Manufacturing and Mapping Room, were published to facilitate scholars' research.</p>
<p>2.  Promoting Archaeology</p>
<p>The study of ancient artifacts began in the Song Dynasty but later declined. It was not until the emergence of Ruan Yuan, Wu Qingqing, and others in the Qing Dynasty that this lost learning was greatly revived. Their diligence in collecting and their precision in appraisal almost surpassed the people of the Song Dynasty. However, they focused on determining the age of individual artifacts and examining inscriptions, lacking comprehensive research. They did not follow the Song scholars' practice of using ancient artifacts to elucidate rituals and using ancient scripts to correct books.</p>
<p>By the years of the Republic, only a few people were engaged in this field. Although countless ancient artifacts were unearthed daily, only Luo Zhenyu collected and disseminated them. However, archaeologists studying ancient artifacts must not only know their shapes and understand their times but also know their excavation sites, excavation circumstances, and all related information. Therefore, it is important to conduct on-site investigations and carry out planned excavations using scientific methods. For this reason, the Institute of Chinese Studies at Peking University established an Archaeological Research Office in May of the twelfth year of the Republic, and also established an Ancient Sites and Artifacts Investigation Committee to implement investigations and prepare for excavation and preservation. The scope of investigation was divided into three categories: ancient sites, ancient artifacts, and ancient works of art. The methods of investigation were divided into five categories: photography, rubbing, modeling, drawing, and recording. In August of that year, many Zhou Dynasty bronzes were unearthed in Xin Zheng and Meng Jin counties of Henan Province. Mr. Ma Shuping was invited to investigate and brought back rubbings and photographs. More than six hundred bronzes and cart decorations unearthed in Meng Jin were purchased. Later, Xu Xusheng, Li Xuanbo, Chen Wanli, and Xu Sheng also participated in the investigation of ancient sites and artifacts. The investigations of the Ming Dynasty relics on Da Gong Mountain, the ancient artifacts unearthed in the Bei Mang Mountain in Luoyang, and the ancient sites in Dunhuang, Gansu, made significant contributions to archaeology. By the sixteenth year, the collected antiquities, including metal and stone inscriptions, oracle bones, and pottery, amounted to more than four thousand pieces, along with fifty-seven Yuan Dynasty murals from Xinghua Temple in Ji Shan, Shanxi, and more than twelve thousand kinds of rubbings of metal and stone inscriptions (see the "Outline of the Institute of Chinese Studies" in February of the sixteenth year).</p>
<p>3.  Paying Attention to the Investigation of Ballads and Customs</p>
<p>In December of the ninth year of the Republic (1920), Peking University established the Ballad Research Association, which was incorporated into the Institute of Chinese Studies in the eleventh year. Approximately fourteen thousand ballads were collected before and after, and the "Ballad Weekly" was published, compiling ballads by province, totaling ninety-six issues. Several ballad series were also published. In May of the twelfth year of the Republic, the Customs Investigation Committee was established. The methods of investigation included written records and the collection of physical objects. The materials obtained were published in the "Ballad Weekly" and the "Weekly of the Institute of Chinese Studies" in the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925).</p>
<p>From the above three aspects, it is clear that although Mr. Shen's specialized field was not history, his contribution to promoting the atmosphere of academic research cannot be ignored. Mr. Shen once said: "The atmosphere of Peking University's research on Chinese studies has undergone three changes: initially, it followed the remaining habits of the late Qing Dynasty, emphasizing ancient prose; after three or four years, it advocated philology; around the tenth year, it gradually leaned toward science, increasingly moving towards the use of empirical methods. It was believed that the shortcomings of scholars in the past who completely believed in books should be corrected. Therefore, the Institute of Chinese Studies promoted archaeology in ancient research, focusing on the collection of ancient artifacts; in modern research, it focused on government archives and folk customs. Holding these two major new sources of information, it supported the research of books, opening up a new path for scholars." (See the preface to the "Compilation of Old Archives Stored in the Qing Cabinet" that he wrote) This also shows the depth of Mr. Shen's planning and consideration.</p>
<p>Examining the development of historical studies in the past twenty years, it relied on two things: one was the method of scientific empiricism, and the other was the discovery of new historical materials. The method of scientific empiricism was advocated by Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Hu Shih, becoming a new trend of thought since the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic; the discovery of new historical materials was largely due to the help of archaeologists. Mr. Shen was a radical figure of the May Fourth era and the strongest advocate of archaeology. Therefore, he had a driving force in the progress of historical studies.</p>
<h3>Several Questions Regarding "The Categories of Poets"</h3>
<p>— Xiang Changqing</p>
<p>Regarding the collation of "The Categories of Poets," if we base it on the "Four Series Complete Collection," the "Xue Jin Tao Yuan" edition, and the "School Edition," we can see at least the following questions:</p>
<p>First, the number of authors listed. The preface to "The Categories of Poets" says:</p>
<p>"Rong has only recorded five-character poems. Although the net encompasses the past and present, and the words and texts are almost complete, I lightly wish to distinguish clearly between the pure and the impure, picking out the faults and advantages, totaling one hundred and twenty people. Those who participate in this lineage may be called talented scholars."</p>
<p>The summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" says:</p>
<p>"Rong was well-versed in the Book of Changes and excelled in writing. He categorized ancient and modern five-character poems, from the Han and Wei dynasties to the present, totaling one hundred and three people, discussing their strengths and weaknesses, dividing them into upper, middle, and lower categories." It also says:</p>
<p>"Among the one hundred and three people, only Wang Rong is called Wang Yuanchang without mentioning his given name."</p>
<p>According to "The Categories of Poets," the number of people listed is one hundred and twenty. However, in Zijiang Yu's poem, it says, "My brother's sacrifice is not to be missed." And in Zhang Xintai's poem, it says, "Xintai and his son Zhen are superior to Xigu in writing." Therefore, the actual number of people commented on should be one hundred and twenty-two. The statement in the summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" is of unknown origin.</p>
<p>Second, in the middle category, there is Ying Qu, a Wei Attendant, and in the lower category, there is also Ying Qu, a Jin Literary Figure. In my humble opinion, the Jin Literary Figure Ying Qu in the lower category is actually a mistake for Ying Chang, a Wei Literary Figure. The "Wei Zhi" says:</p>
<p>"Ying Chang, whose courtesy name was Delian, was from Runan. Emperor Taizu summoned him to serve as an aide in the Prime Minister's office and later as a Literary Figure for the General of the Five Offices. He died." (According to the "Wen Xuan" citation)</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the Literary Figure Ying Qu should be Ying Chang. The "Wen Xuan" records a poem from his collection "Ji on the Jianzhang Terrace" when he was an Attendant of the General of the Five Offices. Some may suspect that Ying Qu should be Ying Zhen because Zhen was a Jin person. However, an examination of Yu Zhongrong's "Articles of Literature" says:</p>
<p>"Ying Zhen, whose courtesy name was Jifu, was famous for his talent from a young age and was capable of discussion. Emperor Wu of Jin appointed him as a military advisor when he was General of Pacification. After the Jin Dynasty ascended to the throne, he was promoted to be a Gentleman of the Crown Prince's Household and a Palace Attendant."</p>
<p>Ying Chang once served as a Literary Figure of the General of the Five Offices, while Ying Zhen served as a military advisor to the General of Pacification, a Gentleman of the Crown Prince's Household, and a Palace Attendant. It can be seen that the so-called Literary Figure Ying Qu should be Ying Chang and definitely not Ying Zhen. The characters "Chang" and "Qu" both have the radical "jade" and are easily mistaken, while the characters "Zhen" and "Qu" are very different. Some may say that the arrangement of "The Categories of Poets" is in chronological order. The original order is Ruan Yu, a Wei Clerk; Ouyang Jian, the Governor of Dunqiu in Jin; Ying Qu, a Jin Literary Figure; Ji Han, the Secretary of the Jin Imperial Secretariat; Ruan Kan, the Governor of Henan in Jin; Ji Shao, an Attendant of Jin; and Zao Ju, a Jin Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. It seems that after Ouyang Jian, the Governor of Dunqiu in Jin, there should not be the title of a Wei Literary Figure Ying Chang. However, this statement cannot be completely trusted. Generally speaking, the order is chronological. But there are a few exceptions in the middle. For example, in the middle category, after Emperor Wen of Wei, there is Ji Kang, a Jin Middle Gentleman; Zhang Hua, the Minister of Works of Jin; followed by He Yan, a Wei Gentleman; Sun Chu, the Governor of Fenyii in Jin; Wang Zan, a Jin Author; Zhang Han, a Clerk of the Jin Minister of Works (according to the records, "minister of works" is extraneous); Pan Ni, a Secretary of the Jin Imperial Secretariat; but after that, there is Ying Qu, a Wei Attendant. It can be seen that it is not impossible to have the title of a Wei Literary Figure Ying Chang after Ouyang Jian, the Governor of Dunqiu in Jin. This may be due to Zhong Rong's negligence, or it may be due to errors in copying over one or two thousand years, resulting in this irregular phenomenon. I believe that Wei being mistaken for Jin, and Chang being mistaken for Qu, are both very possible. However, the title of Literary Figure would definitely not be confused with things like military advisor to the General of Pacification, Gentleman of the Crown Prince's Household, or Palace Attendant. Moreover, the "Wen Xuan" only records one poem by Ying Zhen, "Collection of the Emperor Wu of Jin in the Hualin Garden," which is a four-character poem and not within the scope of Zhong Rong's discussion. This further illustrates that the Literary Figure Ying Qu is definitely not Ying Zhen.</p>
<p>Third, the summary of the "Four Series Complete Collection" says:</p>
<p>"History says that Rong once sought praise from Shen Yue, but Yue did not give it to him. Therefore, Rong resented him and listed Yue in the middle category. According to the records, Yue's poems are listed in the middle category, which is not considered suppression. However, in the preface, he deeply criticized the study of prosody, saying that 'wasp waists and crane knees' and 'I am not good at it,' and 'double alliteration and repeated rhymes' and 'the common people already have it.' It is clear that he is attacking Yue's theories, which is not entirely without reason." An examination of the preface to the lower category of "The Categories of Poets" says:</p>
<p>"I believe that literary works must be recited and read, and should not be hindered. But now, the pure and the impure flow together, and the pronunciation is harmonious and smooth, which is sufficient. As for level, rising, departing, and entering tones, I am not good at it. Wasp waists and crane knees, the common people already have it." I don't understand why the original text, "As for level, rising, departing, and entering tones, I am not good at it. Wasp waists and crane knees, the common people already have it," was quoted by the scholars of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" as "Wasp waists and crane knees, I am not good at it, double alliteration and repeated rhymes, the common people already have it!" And it is said that "It is clear that he is attacking Yue's theories." This is also difficult to understand. The preface to "The Categories of Poets" says: "Wang Yuanchang initiated it, and Shen Yue and Xie Tiao amplified its waves." It is clear that the main target is Wang Rong, and Shen Yue and Xie Tiao are just amplifying the waves. Shen Yue's poems were listed in the middle category by Rong. The summary says: "Each category is preceded by a preface." But the so-called attack is in the preface to the lower category, which shows that Shen Yue and Xie Tiao were only mentioned incidentally. As for the historical claim that Rong once sought praise from Shen Yue, but Yue did not give it to him, so Rong resented him and listed Shen Yue in the middle category, this has been discussed extensively in the second chapter and does not need to be repeated.</p>
<p>Fourth, the summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" also says:</p>
<p>"Among the one hundred and three people, only Wang Rong is called Wang Yuanchang without mentioning his given name. Some suspect that he was showing him private respect. However, Xu Ling's 'New Songs from the Jade Terrace' also only mentions Rong's courtesy name. It is likely that during the Qi and Liang dynasties, people avoided the personal name of Emperor He of Qi, so they used the courtesy name. There is no other reason. Now, we will retain the original text to preserve its original state."</p>
<p>According to "The Categories of Poets," the term Yuanchang appears three times: the first time it says, "Recently, Ren Fang and Wang Yuanchang and others did not value the strangeness of words but competed for new events." The second time it says: "In the Qi dynasty, there was Wang Yuanchang." The third time it says: "Wang Yuanchang initiated it." But in the individual discussion, it is still "Wang Rong, General of Ning Shuo of Qi," not Wang Yuanchang. It can be seen that the personal name and courtesy name are used together. There are many examples of using the personal name and courtesy name together, such as in Yan Yi's general discussion, "Xie Ke was the hero of the Yuanjia era, and Yan Yannian was his assistant." But the individual discussion is "Yan Yanzhi, Guanglu Grand Master of Song," which originated from Lu Ji. Yanzhi is the personal name, and Yannian is the courtesy name. Also, the general discussion says, "First, Guo Jingchun used his literary strength to create his style, and Liu Yueshi relied on his pure and firm spirit to achieve its beauty together." Also, it says, "Yueshi was moved by the chaos, and Jingchun chanted about immortals." But the individual discussion is Liu Kun, the Grand Commandant of Jin, and Guo Pu, the Governor of Guinong in Jin. Also, the general discussion says, "Xie Yishou continued to write, flourishingly." The individual discussion is Xie Hun, the Imperial Secretariat Director. In addition, Wang Can, Zhongxuan, Liu Zhen, Gonggan, Pan Yue, Anren, Zhang Xie, Jingyang, Ji Kang, Shuye, Zhang Hua, Maoxian, Liu Hui, Shizhang, He Yan, Pingshu, Lu Ji, Shiheng, Zuo Si, Taichong, Zhang Han, Jiying, Yuan Hong, Yanbo, Bao Zhao, Mingyuan, Jiang Yan, Wentong, Ren Fang, Yansheng, Shen Yue, Xiuming, Ban Gu, Mengjian, Zhao Yi, Wensheng, Xu Gan, Weichang, Ruan Yu, Yuanyu, Ouyang Jian, Jianshi, are countless examples. How can it be said that Wang Rong is the only one called Wang Yuanchang without mentioning his given name, and therefore he was showing him private respect? Moreover, the preface to "The Categories of Poets" attacks Wang Rong's theory of prosody so thoroughly. How can it be possible to talk about showing him private respect? If one could carefully read through "The Categories of Poets," one would know that the use of personal names and courtesy names is quite chaotic. It is really impossible to find a rule. If we say that the character "Rong" in Wang Rong, General of Ning Shuo of Qi, was changed by later generations and cannot be used as evidence of using personal names and courtesy names together, then Zhang Rong, the Registrar of the Qi Minister of Works, should also be referred to by his courtesy name. Otherwise, the character "Rong" in Yu Rong violates the taboo of Emperor He of Qi. Why doesn't the character "Rong" in Zhang Rong also violate the taboo? Therefore, the statement in the summary of the "Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature" is simply perplexing to us.</p>
<p>However, these are just my humble opinions.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Recently, I continued reading Nehru's "The Discovery of India," which has many wonderful words. He wants to defend the history and culture of India, so he calls it "Discovery." In his seventh chapter, he describes the British invasion of India and the rise of the Indian national movement:</p>
<p>"Some Englishmen say: What makes the Indians most disgusted with us is nothing more than the Indian history we have written. This person can be said to have a considerable understanding of the Indians. To be honest: history is always written by the victors or conquerors. And it is according to their point of view. At least, their theory is the main component. Today, the angered companions of India, the officials, the rulers, the so-called upper class, are the Aryans who came from Central Asia in ancient times, that is, the early Indian conquerors. They wrote a lot of history at that time. Of course, these things are unfair to the indigenous people. Or, no one can jump out of their own ethnic concept circle, and it is even more difficult to escape their own cultural traditions and limitations. So, even if a person sometimes expresses a fair view, it may be regarded as treason in the eyes of his own nation. Especially war, is a more obvious example. It can make the nations or countries completely and systematically abandon justice and truth. As long as the other party thinks it is right, I must think it is wrong. Similarly, what I think is right, the other party also thinks the same. So, people's hearts become rough and close off all roads leading to the truth, leaving only the one they think is right. At this time, the greatest power is to explain one's own actions as reasonable, and to scold the other party as nonsense. Truth seems to be buried deep in the well, leaving ignorance to rule everything with the highest power."</p>
<p>Although we have not yet studied the Indian history written by the British in detail, it is probably not much different from the "History of Manchuria" written by the Japanese. Nehru's argument is also the theory of the Confucians that benevolence and righteousness exist only in the court of princes, and the theory of Laozi and Zhuangzi that each is what they are and each is not what they are, but it is said more concretely and clearly. Originally, I have repeatedly said that human reason is very limited and should not be overestimated because it is the spirit of all things. Xunzi's theory of the evil of human nature is not necessarily nonsense compared to Mencius's theory of the goodness of human nature. The right and wrong of history probably represent this lack of reason. The children of the countryside or the hawkers can have an objective standard to evaluate characters, just like watching Peking opera, the big white face must be a good guy, and the black face must be rough and rude, which is obvious at a glance. This is probably influenced by novels, dramas, and even legends and folk literature. There is no second saying or power that can contradict or conflict. If you read a little bit, you will feel some headache problems, such as the dispute of orthodoxy, the evaluation after death, each has its own position and each has its own background, like a kaleidoscope, ever-changing. It is enough to make people dizzy even without historians writing "Wu Mu is not a loyal minister theory" or "Zixu is not a filial son theory!" What's more, there are so many unashamed intellectuals who cater to the times, try to figure out the situation, and must play beautiful new music and sing praises to the emperor when Wang Mang is in power!</p>
<p>Those who study history are easily confused, mostly because of this. The work of textual critics and annotators is therefore endless. Like the fox burying its bones, they create their own confusion and then circle around it themselves, not knowing what they are doing! Hu Shih's diary of studying abroad, Volume 15, Article 48, "Following the Way Instead of the Ungodly," is a very apt discussion. I will copy it to clarify the above:</p>
<p>"Wang Renqiu is dead. Ten years ago, I read his 'Xiangqilou Letter,' which contained a letter to his daughter-in-law, saying, 'They entered my capital, and they cannot destroy me. What can there be to divide? Even if they divide, following the way instead of the ungodly, what is wrong!' I was very angry when I read it at that time, thinking that this old man did not know how to love his country and was saying such shameless words! In the past ten years, my thinking has also changed. Now I think that the saying 'following the way instead of the ungodly' only does not conform to the nationalism of today. Judging fairly, this saying is originally the old intention passed down by the ancient sages of our country. How can we blame an eighty-year-old scholar with the heresy of nineteenth-century Europe? I once said that nationalism (ethnic nationalism) has only one basis on which to stand, and all others are insufficient to argue. What is this only basis? It says: 'The autonomy of one nation will always be better than the rule of another nation.' Only this premise. For example, the reason why our country's anti-Manchuism can be established is precisely because the history of the Manchu ethnic group for 270 years has been enough to prove that they cannot rule the Han ethnic group. If you get a Yuan Shikai by removing a Manchu, it is not necessarily better than that. It is not necessarily better than that, so we will not tolerate it because it is of the same race. This is why the second and third revolutions arose. If you let people choose between Yuan Shikai and Wilson, then people must choose Wilson. Those who choose Yuan Shikai because Wilson is a different ethnic group must be fools poisoned by nationalism. This is the meaning of following the way instead of the ungodly. I have wronged Wang Renqiu. Now this old man is dead, so I record this to redeem myself...'"</p>
<p>This was said in the sixth year of the Republic. At that time, Yuan Shikai died because of his failed attempt to become emperor. Soon after, there was the restoration of Emperor Xuantong. Hu Shih was in the United States and would soon return to China. If you replace Wilson with Yuan Shikai, what would be the outcome from a nationalist perspective? Wang Renqiu's argument, first, it erases justice, and then, in a turn, it becomes supreme justice. Think about it, how terrible are human theories and perspectives! When the First World War broke out, Britain declared war on Germany, and the whole country conscripted soldiers, but the great philosopher Russell rose up and launched the Anti-Conscription Association. Noah Conscription Fellowship was therefore expelled from Cambridge University and punished by law. How should this be explained?</p>
<p>I once read an article by Liang Sicheng called "Outside the Window," which says that those of us who sit inside the window can never understand what is outside. This window exists wherever we go. So, we and society are always separated by a layer of windows. Although we can see it, we don't completely understand it after all. Moreover, there is no relationship between interests. How can scholars and young people who claim to go to the countryside, carrying cameras and bringing folding beds to the masses in fifteenth-century production methods and wearing short cloth clothes, break through each other's windows? This is very interesting. It makes me think of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great's construction of the new capital St. Petersburg, calling it "opening the window of Eastern Europe to circulate the air of Western Europe." It can be seen that having a window and opening it is not enough to fulfill the window's responsibility. We may still be able to open the windows between each other and be sincere with others who exist at the same time. —But in reality, it is quite difficult. Just look at the international disputes today and you will know. —But for the ancients who are separated by hundreds or even thousands of years, how can we "make friends" with them? Then this window is like the window of Qin Shi Huang's Mausoleum on Mount Li. Once the burial is completed, it is sealed, making the world imagine the fish oil lamps, the shooting mechanisms, and the crossbows, but there is no way to see its true appearance?</p>
<h3>Memoirs and the Like</h3>
<p>— Yan Ru</p>
<p>Chinese newspapers almost all have supplements, and the supplements invariably have long articles, which are invariably novels! I am very sorry to say that having read newspapers for over forty years, I rarely read the long novels in the supplements. Not out of contempt, but out of fear of boredom. If it's an old-style novel where dialogue isn't written on separate lines, you might still find a little story interesting each day, but if it's new-style, then "How are you?" he said. "Thank you, I am well," she replied.</p>
<p>With this kind of thing, you can only hear a few polite words from the male protagonist each day. A long novel like Remarque's "Arch of Triumph" would take years to finish reading. A colossal work like Hugo's "Les Misérables" simply couldn't be completed in less than ten or twenty years. So in my personal opinion, publishing long novels in newspaper supplements is really not as good as publishing memoirs. The Shen Bao's publication of Herriot's memoirs made me love reading it every day. Although being published in a supplement means it can't be several thousand words a day, the content is factual, which is much better than "How are you? I am well."</p>
<p>Currently, it is a time when memoirs are popular. Although the world is not yet at peace after several years of war, it has at least provided some military and political giants with material to write memoirs. This war can be considered worthwhile for that reason alone. Yesterday, the newspaper reported that Tojo was also going to write one, "to be published after his execution, to provide for the needs of his family." This is a good deal. I think Tojo would write one even if he weren't executed. From this, you can see that being a "big shot" is worth it after all. Whether you succeed or fail, are good or evil, you still have the qualification to write memoirs and earn a large amount of manuscript fees.</p>
<p>Memoirs are a type of autobiography, but they are relatively limited to a particular time or event. Some say that the development of biography is related to the prosperity of a nation, and cite the prevalence of biographical literature in 19th-century England as evidence. Although I don't know if this is true, considering the lack of biographical literature in China and the fact that China's national fortune is not particularly prosperous, there may be some truth to it. However, the main reason for the lack of biographical literature in China, I think, lies in the self-effacement of great men and gentlemen. Mr. Hu Shi was a bit of a biography enthusiast, constantly urging Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Zhang Jusheng to write autobiographies, but his own "Forty-Year Self-Narration" only covered up to his twenties before he stopped. It seems that he will only finish it when he is eighty, and the "Eighty-Year Self-Narration" won't be started until he is a hundred.</p>
<p>Besides autobiographies, there are biographies of others, which are also rare in China. Not to mention others, even the biography of Mr. Sun Yat-sen has yet to be done well. The reason for this, besides the self-effacement of those qualified to write biographies, may also be related to the Chinese obsession with perfection. People are not gods, and shortcomings are inevitable. For example, in Lytton Strachey's biography of Queen Victoria, he made some subtle criticisms of the Queen and the Prince Consort, but the British royal family was magnanimous enough not to ban it, and readers found the subject of the biography more relatable and endearing because she had human imperfections. Chinese biographies of others are different. There is a fear that the subject might have even the slightest flaw exposed, making them seem less like the bodhisattvas in temples. Under these conditions, it is difficult to start writing an autobiography, and writing a biography of others is also hopeless.</p>
<p>On a much smaller scale than biographies, and not necessarily about famous officials or magnates, are character sketches. American magazines seem to have a lot of this kind of work, whether it's about how a black man's son studied hard and succeeded, or how a country doctor is happy to provide medical care, or how an eighty-year-old woman makes things convenient for others, or how a disabled person strives to overcome the difficulties of eye and leg problems, making readers feel that they should strive to be optimistic and not always sigh and want to die. There are plenty of such nameless people in China. Even if you write a few disrespectful words, such as saying that a person's sitting posture is incorrect or their standing posture is unsteady, you won't be punished or suffer. I think we can emulate this to add some vitality to the gloomy Chinese literary style. I wonder if the wise think this is right?</p>
<h3>A Clever Way to Win a Case</h3>
<p>— Shirley</p>
<p>In a car accident case, the plaintiff's lawyer presented a witness and claimed that the witness saw the defendant's broken speedometer pointing to an illegal speed of 75 miles per hour moments after the accident.</p>
<p>When the witness was brought to court, the defendant's defense lawyer asked, "Do you smoke cigarettes?"</p>
<p>"Um—I do," the astonished witness replied. He didn't know what the defendant's lawyer meant by asking this question.</p>
<p>"Camel brand?" the lawyer asked again.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Good, now please tell the court, does the camel driver on the Camel cigarette pack wear a hat?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied quickly.</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer took a pack of Camel cigarettes out of his pocket and handed it to the witness.</p>
<p>"I know you are an honest man," he then said, "and you wouldn't lie for no reason. Like this cigarette pack, there is no camel driver on it at all, but after I asked you if this person wears a hat, you really thought there was such a person. It's the same with this case. The plaintiff's lawyer said that you saw the needle on the speedometer pointing to a speed of 75 miles per hour—my client denies it, and the same impression was created in your mind, as if you did see something that you didn't actually see."</p>
<p>The defendant finally won the case.</p>
<h3>No Reductions Allowed</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>With great difficulty, the salaries of public school teachers were adjusted once.</p>
<p>The "adjustment" mentioned here actually contains a double meaning. It is not just a different name for a price increase, as is commonly understood. Because this salary adjustment for public school teachers, although discussed and studied several times by some committee, some yuan, and some department, resulted in greater losses for those with smaller base salaries and more increases for those with larger base salaries. For those with base salaries below one hundred yuan, not only was there no increase of even half a Taiwanese dollar), but instead, they received a 30% or 20% cut. Every time public utilities and daily necessities are adjusted, they increase by 50% to 100%, but the salaries of public school teachers are adjusted to be even lower than before.</p>
<p>On the surface, the index seems to be larger, but the in-kind distribution is reduced and the differential subsidy is lowered. In the end, it is still a clear increase but a hidden decrease, advancing in order to retreat. Poor public school teachers have once again eaten an empty bowl of soup! If it were a clear salary reduction, that would be fine, but unfortunately, those who don't know the truth always think that salaries have been increased, and they wouldn't think of anything else, would they?</p>
<p>But this year seems to be the "year of bad luck for public school teachers." It's not enough that they secretly suffered from this adjustment. News has come that the government's administrative program for this year includes a clause on reducing staff and simplifying administration, and various agencies will tighten their organizations and prepare to eliminate 25% of redundant personnel. This is a serious problem because salary adjustment is ultimately a question of whether or not one can eat enough, while personnel reduction is a question of whether or not one has food to eat at all. Twenty-five percent is not a small number. Where will these laid-off personnel find work? I wonder if anyone has thought about this? Assuming they have thought about it, besides letting them fend for themselves, I wonder if there is a feasible solution?</p>
<p>If anyone goes to look at the offices of government agencies today, they will all feel that there are indeed many redundant personnel to be laid off today. Because what is astonishing is that many government agencies seem to be full of "civil servants" who are empty-handed, reading tabloids, and humming tunes in the office. If these redundant personnel are not laid off, it will of course be a waste of national expenditure and an increase in the burden on the people. But these redundant personnel are mostly the "old masters" who cannot be touched by others. Once layoffs begin, even if 75% of the staff are laid off, it won't be their heads that are on the chopping block. Instead, it is the hard-working members of each agency who will be sacrificed under the layoff order. They are dependent on no one, so of course they will bear the brunt and will inevitably be included in the list of those to be laid off. In this way, if the backbone of the agencies is all driven away, administrative efficiency will definitely drop sharply, to an unexpected degree.</p>
<p>Salary reductions have already been implemented, and it seems that layoffs are inevitable. It is probably of very little use to say now that layoffs should not be made. But the first to be affected by the layoffs will of course be the laid-off group, and directly or indirectly, the entire administrative efficiency will be affected. In the end, nothing can be done. Suddenly, I thought of the dispute caused by the ban on dancing by dance hall workers, and I couldn't help but feel a chill run down my spine.</p>
<h3>Several Poems Remembering Sanmu, Shufan, Baicao, and Others in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yao Yuanchu</p>
<p>How can a clear stream be mixed with a turbid stream? All the gentlemen in my eyes live in high buildings together:</p>
<p>They would not beg for rice from the barbarian slaves, and drunkenly scolded the reckless garrison commander.</p>
<p>The wolves are exhausted, but you, sir, are not yet old, and countless wine cups are used to repay each other.</p>
<p>I wonder if you also think of me, a distant traveler? Above, I face the cold in a tattered fur coat!</p>
<h3>Reply to Mr. Yuanchu and Inquiring About the Invitation to Tour Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>The first willows of the capital brush against light carriages, who would wear tattered wheat and endure mockery?</p>
<p>The cold office is clear enough to seal white letters, the whole family happily speaks of living in black clothes!</p>
<p>My heart follows the wooden boat's lakeside agreement, and the writing feast flies over the sea like spring clouds.</p>
<p>Poetry should always prioritize feelings of joy and sorrow, knowing that you are rarely supplementing admonishments to the emperor.</p>
<h3>Tofu and Pork</h3>
<p>— Guang Jue</p>
<p>Among the mundane reports that my wife constantly brings back from the vegetable market, two are slightly interesting.</p>
<p>First, she wants me to guess, what is the one thing whose business is worse than usual during the New Year, when everything else sells well? I couldn't guess, but it turns out to be tofu. Tofu is vegetarian, good quality, and inexpensive, and people eat too much of it usually. During the New Year, people should keep it at a distance. In addition, everything during the New Year should be auspicious, but this thing seems to symbolize something unlucky. It is always present in mourning ceremonies, which are also called tofu meals. Besides its white color, I don't know what other reason there is. People who study folklore should be able to explain it.</p>
<p>Second, she tells me that the landlady of the tailor shop next door went to the vicinity of the railway station to buy a piece of pork, and the price was half that of the vegetable market. When she got home, she washed it again and again, looked at it, smelled it, and was always uneasy, fearing that it was not fresh, even suspecting that it was a dead pig. My wife's meaning is that it's rare to eat meat, so why bother to save a little money and make yourself depressed during the New Year. I think that it is precisely because it is rare to eat meat that people want to eat more meat during the New Year. It is better to save a little money after all. Fearing that the quality is not guaranteed, they have no choice but to buy cheaper goods. From this little thing, you can write about the suffering of the people. However, I told her to tell the tailor shop landlady that the casual customers these days are just rushing for the holiday season. The reason why it is cheaper is because of the slaughter tax and the profits of the meat vendors and butcher shops. The meat is definitely the same good, so you can eat it with peace of mind.</p>
<p>People are always afraid of being deceived by others, but in fact, others are just trying to make a living, and they don't all rely on deception to make a living. If everyone could live more easily, this kind of unpleasant emotion could be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Race</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiu</p>
<p>A small thief suddenly broke into a dormitory at Kansas State University in the United States. He secretly opened the refrigerator, gorged himself on the food stored in the refrigerator, and after eating his fill, he carried a chicken in one hand and two pounds of fish in the other. But when he tried to sneak away, he was suddenly discovered by the students, so these young people ran after him. Unexpectedly, after chasing for half a mile, they still couldn't catch him.</p>
<p>The students didn't mind the food. What frustrated them was that they couldn't catch the thief who had flown away. And one of the students was particularly frustrated, his name was Ray Adey—a famous long-distance runner in the United States!</p>
<h3>Talking about Plum Blossoms in Chao Mountain</h3>
<p>— Tangxi</p>
<p>Spring has come to the world, and the annual Chao Mountain plum blossom viewing tour is busy with preparations again. Those who tour Chao Mountain mostly want to catch a glimpse of the Song Plum. In fact, the beauty of Chao Mountain plum blossoms lies in the fact that they encircle ten miles, like a sea of fragrant snow. Therefore, plum blossom viewers should stroll slowly around the mountain, with the Dragon Cave and the Qian Yuan Taoist Temple as the endpoint, in order to truly appreciate the charm. As for the so-called Song Plum, it is suspected that those who like novelty transplanted it here from somewhere else, and then used the old objects of the Song Palace as a gimmick. Without evidence, it is not believable. Moreover, this plum blossom has been neglected during the war, and half of the plant has withered. Only half of the plant still has flowers blooming against the rocks. It seems that it will soon be split into firewood. The nearby Daming Hall (Bao Ci Temple), the temple is not grand, and the monks are also vulgar. The Xiang Hai Tower is a place to rest and drink, but it is not worth mentioning compared to the beauty of the Helin Buddhist Palace. A poem by Yao, a local villager, "The site of the six tombs is vague and desolate, why does a single fragrance remain after hundreds of kalpas? It is not about the historical records that the flowers were originally good, nor is it about relying on false names that the scenery is self-evident! I have experienced many changes in the world, and I laugh at the warmth and coldness of welcoming and sending off officials. I pity the towering pride of the bone, and diligently discuss rice and grain with the mountain monk!" is very satirical and realistic, so I will record it here as well.</p>
<h3>The Chronicle of Hanshan Temple</h3>
<p>— Yu Yifen</p>
<p>Liang Rengong's National Studies Bibliography once listed the book "Records of Stones" by Ye Changchi of Changzhou. Ye's given name was Yuandu, and his style name was Jushang. He was proficient in the study of bronze and stone inscriptions and supplementary editions. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he compiled the "Chronicle of Hanshan Temple" at the request of Su Fu Cheng Xuelou (Dequan). After the book was completed, Xuelou asked to read it. Before long, the Qing dynasty was overthrown, and the manuscript remained in the court and was not issued. Ye felt the sorrow of leaving his homeland, so he revised it once and wrote a postscript during the Gaojie Festival in the Renzi year (1912), signing himself as a "remnant of the Ji Jian," not without subtle criticism of Xuelou's betrayal. An appendix was attached to the postscript, in which he expressed deep dissatisfaction with a certain young master, reportedly referring to Zheng Shuwen (Wenzhuo), who was known as Dahe, because Shuwen had made some criticisms of the book. The entire chronicle consists of three volumes: Volume 1 includes "Chronicle of Bridges," "Chronicle of Temples," "Chronicle of Images," and "Chronicle of Bells." Volume 2 includes "Chronicle of Steles," "Chronicle of Monks," "Chronicle of Properties," "Chronicle of Tours," and "Chronicle of Events." Volume 3 includes "Chronicle of Poems," with appendices on the "Deeds of Hanshan and Shide," "Annotations on the Collection of Hanshan's Poems," and "Various Documents, Poems, and Prefaces." It was printed in two volumes, engraved in April of the Renxu year (1922) by Pan's Publishing House in Wuxian, with the signature of Wu Yinpei of Wuxian, about ten years after the book was completed.</p>
<p>The engraver of the "Chronicle of Hanshan Temple," Pan Zhongwu (Zunian), was the younger brother of Pan Wenqin (Zuyin, style name Boyin), a famous official of the Qing Dynasty, and also a student of Grand Historian Jushang. Ye's posthumous works were all engraved by Pan. During the late Qing Dynasty, Zhongwu served as a censor in the Ministry of Justice. He resigned and returned home at the age of twenty-two because of his role in supervising executions, and had a seal engraved with the inscription "Returning to the Fields at Twenty." Mr. Wu Hufan was Pan's son-in-law, and I was able to read this chronicle through Hufan's permission.</p>
<h3>Happy Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Willing Sacrifice 76</p>
<p>Little Wang's mother spat and said, "Don't talk nonsense, who would believe you!" Zhu Zhai said, "Really, I had a good impression of you the first time I saw you." Little Wang's mother said, "What good impression?" Zhu Zhai said, "As soon as I saw you, I knew you were clever and cute, and also a very gentle and affectionate girl." Little Wang's mother shook her head repeatedly and said, "Don't say that, don't say that, I'm not worthy! I'm a rough person, a country girl. What gentle and affectionate, you should say that to the boss!" Zhu Zhai said, "Well, then, I won't use many words to describe you, I'll just say that you are a good person, with a conscience, you can't deny that!" Little Wang's mother nodded and said, "Everyone should be like that. The boss usually values honesty. Among her many friends, she pays attention to Mr. Xu because Mr. Xu is honest, and what Mr. Xu says is reliable, she often tells me that." Zhu Zhai sighed when he heard this and said, "Where has she gone now?" Little Wang's mother said, "She will come back, she is always kept by that friend. It's almost dawn, go to sleep." As she spoke, she smiled slightly. Zhu Zhai then retracted his hand into the quilt, closed his eyes, and his heart was a mess, how could he fall asleep! From time to time, he secretly opened his eyes to take a look, and saw Little Wang's mother massaging herself with one hand, her eyes still fixed on his face, without the slightest bit of fatigue. Whenever she saw Zhu Zhai open his eyes, she would smile at him slightly. At this time, Zhu Zhai's heart was only focused on Qi Wan, and he felt that Little Wang's mother was like a falling flower with intentional love, but the flowing water was merciless. He closed his eyes in the same way, in a daze. Between sleeping and not sleeping, he was suddenly awakened by a crisp doorbell. Little Wang's mother quickly jumped out of bed, put on her shoes, and went out to open the door. After a while, she came back in. Zhu Zhai had already shouted loudly, "Is the boss back?" He asked twice in a row, but Little Wang's mother didn't answer.</p>
<h3>The Death of Yamamoto Isoroku</h3>
<p>— Translated by Daren</p>
<p>A very special event occurred in the Pacific War in the Solomon Islands, where U.S. forces were preparing to invade New Georgia.</p>
<p>On April 17, a top-secret intelligence report was transmitted to the U.S. Air Force commander in the Solomon Islands, detailing the itinerary of Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, commander-in-chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, who was then inspecting Japanese military bases in the South and Southwest Pacific. According to the report, Yamamoto was scheduled to depart from Rabaul the next morning on a "Betty" (Mitsubishi Type 1 twin-engine bomber), accompanied by his staff in another aircraft of the same type, with a close escort of six Zero fighters. The eight aircraft were scheduled to land at Kahili airfield at 9:45 a.m. local time. The directive ordered the U.S. military commander in the area to use "maximum effort" to destroy Yamamoto. The directive was signed by Secretary of the Navy Knox.</p>
<p>The closest Allied air base to Kahili airfield was the newly built Bainega airfield on the Russell Islands, but Bainega airfield did not have long-range fighters, and the order to attack Yamamoto designated the U.S. Army P-38 Lightning squadron temporarily stationed at Henderson airfield to carry out the mission, commanded by Major Mitchell (John W. Mitchell).</p>
<p>Even with full fuel, the aircraft's endurance was only 500 miles, but from Henderson airfield to Kahili airfield, even the shortest U.S. route was 300 miles. At that time, the central Solomon Islands were occupied by Japanese forces, and the route that the U.S. pilots wanted to take was an arc to the southwest of the central Solomon Islands, because they were afraid of being detected by enemy radar stations, but this route was 400 miles long. Therefore, there was very little time to attack Yamamoto near Kahili airfield. At the suggestion of Major Mitchell and Captain Lanphier (Thomas G. Lanphier Jr.), it was decided to attempt to attack Yamamoto at a location 35 miles northwest of Kahili airfield.</p>
<p>At that time, the secret was not kept well at Henderson airfield, and a large number of officers and soldiers knew the purpose of the trip. This later embarrassed the command.</p>
<p>Eighteen Lightning aircraft could participate in the mission. Major Mitchell designated four to carry out the attack, commanded by Captain Lanphier, and he himself commanded fourteen aircraft for strong cover. Yamamoto was in service when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and had boasted that he would dictate peace terms in the White House, so he was hated by the Americans. It was then expected that as soon as Yamamoto's aircraft arrived at Kahili airfield, the local Japanese air force commander would send out more than 100 aircraft to welcome him.</p>
<p>Of the four aircraft under Captain Lanphier, one blew a tire on the runway and did not take off, and another had mechanical problems and did not take off either. So Major Mitchell sent two more aircraft to supplement them, leaving only twelve aircraft to provide cover.</p>
<p>When flying to Bougainville Island, they flew low over the sea ("flat-top flight") at a speed of 250 miles per hour, and everything went smoothly. Five minutes before the scheduled attack time, the U.S. aircraft ascended into the air, Lanphier's aircraft ascended to 10,000 feet, and Mitchell's aircraft ascended to 21,000 feet. They flew over the Bougainville coast at 9:33.</p>
<p>The success of the attack almost entirely depended on the accurate estimation of Yamamoto's timing. Fortunately, Yamamoto had a habit of keeping strict time, and the U.S. intelligence officers knew this and had informed the U.S. aircrew. As a result, according to U.S. estimates, Yamamoto arrived one minute early. At 9:34, two enemy bombers and six Zero fighters arrived. The expected large number of Japanese aircraft to welcome them did not materialize.</p>
<p>The leading Zero fighter headed straight for Captain Lanphier, and Lanphier shot it down. At this time, Yamamoto's aircraft and his staff's aircraft dived rapidly, almost to the treetops. Lanphier followed the rapid dive, trying to attack the leading aircraft, while also having to evade the attack of two enemy Zero fighters. According to Lanphier's own estimate, he descended to within ten feet of the treetops and made a right angle to the flight line of Yamamoto's aircraft. He opened fire and made a long-range shot. The right engine and right wing of Yamamoto's aircraft caught fire and crashed into the jungle, burning down. (According to later Japanese reports, Yamamoto died in his seat, with his military sword still upright between his thighs.) Lieutenant Barber avoided the attack of three Zero aircraft in the same way and shot down the aircraft of Yamamoto's staff. The only U.S. loss was an aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Hine, who was seen to have his aircraft fall, with smoke trailing from the tail, after a melee with the three Zero aircraft attacking Lieutenant Barber. Hine was never heard from again.</p>
<p>The U.S. military base on Guadalcanal celebrated greatly, and the good news was published in the U.S. Air Force's news briefing. The U.S. side was very afraid that the Japanese side would discover that the U.S. side knew that Yamamoto was on this aircraft, because if the Japanese side discovered this, then they could explore the source of this information. However, the Japanese side always thought that Yamamoto's aircraft was just accidentally destroyed by the U.S. side, and not deliberately targeted, although they were slightly suspicious.</p>
<p>In fact, the inside story is very simple: the U.S. Naval Intelligence Agency had "broken" the Japanese Navy's code a year before this incident occurred. And the knowledge of Yamamoto's itinerary was obtained from intercepting Japanese radio messages. (Translated from Gilbert Cant's "The Great Pacific War")</p>
