<h3>塔虎脫盛主席指陳美援華不夠</h3>
<p>責馬歇爾固執偏見</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿三日電〕參議員塔虎脫，主張予中國以有力之軍事援助，俾消弭共黨之叛亂。渠並斥責美政府所提出之「援華計劃」，謂其乃係救濟計劃，而決無法解決中國之問題。渠並抨擊國務院，謂其鼓勵中共，且宣傳反對蔣主席之言論。塔氏盛譽蔣主席，謂渠爲唯一可防止共產主義蔓延於中國之人物。但渠在東北之軍隊，刻四而受敵，無力與共黨作戰，其原因乃吾人數月來未供應其使用美國武器軍隊之軍火，而蘇聯則盡量以其戰爭結束時，擄自日本之武器援助中共，故除非吾人立即採取有力之行動，否則中國之東北，即將淪入共黨之手·塔虎脫同時抨擊馬歇爾，謂其憑一己之偏見，而在其對中國問題之職責一方面，持完全消極之態度。</p>
<h3>美國黃金政策目前不致變更</h3>
<p>滬市某經濟專家談</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕日前聯合社紐約電傳，美國礦業五金工程協會主持黄金新價一事，記者特趨訪本市某經濟專家，據稱：此刻美國改訂黄金政策，事實決不可能，美國戰後黄金生產雖値工資上漲，產量仍能續增，去年全年估計可達八千萬美元，較之戰前全盛時代一九四〇年之二億一千萬幾達半數，而戰後流入黃金爲數亦多，故其無須再提高金價以刺激黄金生產。美國在援歐計劃進行時，出口無慮，更不必藉提高金價貶低美元，以作商業上之競爭，近來以法國開設黃金市場，外間對美國金市不作種種揣測，其實世界有自由金市者不止法國一處，而美國處境不同，實無接踵效法之必要。</p>
<h3>菲總統即將下令歸還華僑各攤位</h3>

<h3>桂永清談海軍　美政府倘在技術上繼續援華我亽五年內可造成良好基礎</h3>
<p>〔聯合社靑島廿四日電〕中國海軍代總司令桂永淸，昨日向聯合社記者談稱：吾國一日不能保衛海岸，則美國海軍有一日留駐之必要。美國對於維護中國海岸綫北段之安全，貢獻良多。靑島爲美國西太平洋艦隊司令部所在，在遠東方面軍略非常重要，尤其在大連與旅順尙未歸我管理之今日爲然。中國政府希望將來能一駐其北方艦隊於旅順。桂氏稱：渠對早日接收該兩港表示悲觀。中蘇條約給予蘇聯以旅順之管制及在大連之各項權利，實爲笨拙。桂氏並稱：已提議利用新近收復之烟台，爲美軍夏季操演之用，但白吉爾氏尙未答復。記者問：美軍在中國海軍訓練計劃完成時仍將留駐靑島否。桂氏答稱：端視東北，朝鮮與日本局勢而定。桂氏希望對日和約限制日本海軍於今後若千年內應小於中國。中國不欲用禁止方法而佔人之先，但在中國海軍成長之前，必加保護。中國現有驅逐艦五艘，各式小艦艇不足三百艘，將由巡洋艦與重兵艦予以增强。此須視訓練計劃爲轉移，此項計劃可望於三年至五年內完成。海軍現有艦上與海岸官兵四萬名。桂氏承認中國海軍攻勢武器幾等於無，驅逐艦隊中，僅有兩艘未卸除配備，並此亦非六個月不能準備服役。美國政府倘繼續在技術上援華，預料五年內必可造成良好之基礎。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋一陽廿四日電〕新民大戰揭開，匪續有增加，新民及巨流河外圍據點均有激戰，國軍正陸空夾擊匪衆。南將營口港外圍匪未敢進攻，北路開原車站附近匪衆廿三日曾向車站東九公里開原城　郊進犯未逞。又，據鞍山脫險者談：匪對鋼鐵廠尙未加破壞，僅受輕微砲火損傷，該廠未逃出員工迄今未聞有一人傷亡。鞍山之役，匪傷亡達兩萬餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二十三日電〕遼西會戰將在大虎山展開，精銳國軍陸續過錦州東進，關內某部亦絡繹出關接防，錦楡段錦西守軍已與錦州興城國軍取得聯擊。</p>

<p>〔中央社瀋陽二十四日電〕東北一週戰局如次：重點仍在遼南地區，共匪原期圍攻鞍山，以圖策應瀋週境竄擾，國軍洞燭其奸，以極少數兵力，依擄據點應戰，吸引其主力於鞍山一隅，使截成兩段，而將瀋週境匪，迅速擊破。自十七日起，各處匪已先後被擊潰，國軍復展開追擊，共匪自誇精銳之第三縱隊，已遭致命打擊，乃會合其他匪，分路向遼河逃竄。其他如遼北。遼西方面，除國軍進行掃蕩戰後，業無股匪活動，足證瀋周圍形勢更趨穩固。</p>

<h3>陳納德論美國援華軍事援助不可缺言張物品用戰時中美混合團方式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕陳納德將軍昨應記者之請求，發表對美國軍事援華之見解。陳氏稱：「美闕援華方案中不包括軍事援華計劃，致引起中國人民之失望，本人實具同感。余不信僅賴財政·經濟援助，可挽救目前之嚴重局勢。至於美國軍事援華究應以何者爲最有效，本人認爲答覆此問題時，須有一前提，即中美兩國政府之間，必須先有一誠意之諒解，認爲積極之軍事援　爲需要之舉。余個人認爲此舉不獨需要，且爲不可或缺者。在此基本原則獲致協議之前，預測此舉之眞實內容，尙嫌過早。惟余個人相信軍事援華不僅應包括美國顧問及技術協助，且需包括若干與中國主權不牴觸之直接指導。此類中美合作之制度，可以戰時之中美混合團爲例。惟此類合作，應以不直接參與戰鬥爲基礎」。記者復詢以報載有若千美軍顧問，主張國軍自東北撤退，以便全力拱衛華北，是否爲高明之戰略？陳將軍答謂：「美軍顧問贊成撤退東北一點，本人並無所聞。惟該區情勢正在激變之中，行將失去自由選擇之機會。以中國目前之軍事潛能而言，本人甚懷疑如匪軍控制全部東北後，華北能保持穩定局面，就國際影響而言，東北萬一不幸棄守，余深信，美國將大爲震驚，並完全覺悟中國將可能失去防止世界共產主養障之地位」。</p>

<h3>拯救東北同胞脫離水火！</h3>
<p>昔日松花江上的抗日英雄馬占山將軍等，一行八人，日前從故鄉飛抵上海，首先向中央社記者表示：此次奉召晋京，將代表東北民衆向中樞提供意見。前日午後，復招待本市新聞界，詳述東北危機及其拯救東北危亡之道：並已於前夜搭車晋京，向中樞剴切陳訴，作迫切眞誠的呼籲，要求中樞速定拯救東北危亡的大計。由於近來東北戰局，一天嚴重一天，遼陽鞍山旣相繼陷落，本溪又遭共匪猛攻，瀋陽確已陷於重圍之中。全國人民的視綫，都集中在東北。東北是東亞的寳庫，中國的生命綫，人人都曉得「有東北，才可保華北：保華北，才可固華中」的道理。所以京滬兩地的人民，對於民族英雄及東北宿將的過滬晋京，無不表示熱烈的期待，然而同時也滿懷着辛酸滋味的感慨。</p>
<p>據馬占山將軍向中央社記者的表示，將向中樞　出四項意見：（一）建立東北地方武力；（二）改革東北幣制；（三）運糧接濟東北民食；（四）簡化行政機構。前日在滬招待本市新聞界，又復加以說明：（一）勝利以來，市北備受破壞，民生凋敝，加以行政　構　雜，軍民脫節，使東北人民陷於無力自　之苦境，故不得不大聲疾呼，要求政府予以澈底的革新。（二）　北糧食問題日趨嚴重，尤以瀋陽城內的民食最堪憂慮，加以流通券發行過多，以致幣値不及台幣十分之一，應請中樞採取緊急措置，一面運糧以接濟東北民食，另一面改革東北幣制以安定民生。（三）目前東北　局巳臻於最嚴重階段，中樞應卽採取有效措置，加强東北軍事，至少應保持現有據點。（四）東北問題不僅爲全國問題，抑且爲世界問題，全國人民應正視其嚴重性。（五）拯救東北危亡之道，首在打通榆瀋交通綫，同時並須增强華北之軍事力量·（六）東北人力物力充沛，如能善加利用，則可成爲安定中國的偉大力量。</p>
<p>我們聽了馬占山將軍的一席話，好像聽到了東北千萬同胞微弱的呼聲。尤其是馬將軍說：「東北靑年，屢經變亂，多屬熱心愛國之士，保衛鄉士之觀念最强，中央若能有適當辦法，相信渠輩必能負起保衛國家之責」，最使我們威動了。但是我們要反省自問：究竟勝利以來，歷任東北軍政經濟重責者，把握了什麽政策？運用了什麽力量？確實愛護地方沒有？眞能與人民合作沒有？這些大人先生，當初眩於勝利，爭着要去做東北的接收大員，一般議論就高呼必須接收東北的人心，可是喚不醒他們。否則，我們相信不論東北客觀的條件如何惡劣，東北的局勢終不致敗壞到如此地步！固然，共匪在異族支持之下，處心積慮的要搶佔東北，然而歷來負東　軍政　責的文武大員。時時刻刻果能以有辱最高　帥之命爲戒，兢兢業業，當不致對不起東北曁全國的老百姓。而今不能不在危急之際，重勞這些東北耆宿南下呼籲，應該何等慚愧，怎樣懺悔？</p>
<p>共匪企圖以武力覇佔整個東北的野心，在日寇投降之初，卽已暴露無遺。共匪一方面阻撓國軍開往東北接收主權，另一方面又組織所謂「民主聯軍」，進攻國軍業已接收的地區。他們所用的武器，多半是敵寇　降時被蘇軍繳下來的軍械，故其實力相當强大，早爲中外人十所注目。去年春季，共匪又叫出了「確保東北，鞏固華北，發展華中」的口號，更足見共匪企岡覇佔東北，不僅是他們弄兵叛亂的一貫政策，而且也是他們不惜任何代價勢所必爭之點。我們爲國家民族的未來安全計，不能不力阻共匪在東北的發展，入手之處，就該從信任東北有志之士，編練東北地方武力做起。可惜全國朝野在東北變亂之初，雖已提高警覺，而竟不能決定適當的政策，以遏亂萌於共匪沒有坐大之時。假使負責東北軍政經濟的文武大員，當時能洞察環境，知己知彼，本着愛人民愛地方的本意，而絕不存絲毫的　見與偏見，則東北同胞久在日寇虐政之下，必能感奮雀躍，在中央領導之下，出其全力以確保他們的家鄉了。所以東北同胞之不能早脫水火，半由於共匪，而亦半由於這羣誤國的的大官！</p>
<p>雖然，「往者不可諫，來者猶可追」。中樞對於東北的政治·經濟·以及軍事，到了今天，也實在應該　底革新的了。「亡羊補牢，猶未不爲晚」。目前東北耆宿所提出的意見，本是平淡無奇，而貴在當機立斷，迅速實行。全國四億五千萬人民，均願爲拯救東北同胞的後盾·只要領導得宜　不則衆志成城，東北局勢的挽回與固守，還是有望的。我們於此，願約略貢其所見：</p>
<p>第一，不幸的東北，近十年來，屢遭　亂。東北同胞與祖國隔離固爲日已久，對於祖國政情不無隔閡，但是他們投向祖國懷抱的期待，却蘊蓄着强大的向心力。馬將軍等以昔日抗日英的資格，　能重返東北，登高一呼，保衛故鄉，當能獲得東北同胞的共鳴，較易　成其拯救東北的使命。但是馬將軍等別離東北，也近十年，對於今日東北民衆的感情和願望，或亦未必能完全了解，自應力　感情的媾通，見解的接觸，俾能表裏相應，呵成一氣，塡滿了他們雙方之間的距離，而後大力可以發揮。</p>
<p>第二，在東北危急的時候，由東北耆宿打回老家去，固然是最爲適宜之舉；但是我們同時切盼這幾位宿將，一方面老當益壯，一方面提攜眞才，使東北有志之士，無分新舊老少，大家一致爲救地方救人民而努力，則他們才可以負起當前時代的使命。</p>
<p>最後我們相信，中央決不輕易放棄東北的。東北局勢儘管嚴重，但還有辦法可想，還有人力可用。願中央袞袞諸公趕快放遠眼光，擴大胸襟，集中意志，團結力量，以拯救東北同胞於水深火熱之中—</p>

<p>共匪發動叛亂，破壞城　，擾亂我後方人民生活，早著陰謀，抗戰時期，即糾織「城工部」派遣大批工作人員，潛入各大城市活動，勝利後，活動更大，北平爲華北軍政重心，其蓄意破壞，尤不遺餘力。本市治安機關洞悉共匪奸計，乃動員有力幹部，遍佈偵察網，早經獲悉指揮本市地下活動者爲共匪晋察冀中央局劉仁所領導之城工部，對春在不綫索，年來巴有部分瞭解，爲期澈底摧毀其組織計，未予立即破獲，經年餘嚴密監視，跟縱追査，獲悉其城工部組織系統，其主要工作門部門爲工委會，鐵委會，平委會，學委會平委學委更爲其骨幹，幷悉平委會派在本市之主要負責人爲市委包克，以正陽門外某客棧爲主要據點，時與區委張英民等集會</p>
<p>開始行動</p>
<p>經多次守候偵査，確證無訛後，乃於上年底開始行動，當塲捕獲區委張英民，及幹部王承王，齊天慶，張月華（女），吳小波等五人，惟包克行踪詭秘，住址無定，張等就捕後，復偵査三日，包匪終於落網，嗣根據包等所供綫索，續行捕獲匪區委楊英，劉振忠，王宏儒，張海泉，支部書記馬鴻傑，郭春林，交通劉貴榮，高孝才，聯絡員張彥生，單秀文，馬保林，張建恒，　報李振洲，及黨員韓九如等共一百零三人。</p>

<h3>美代表籲請小型大會辦理韓全國選舉監選會不必顧慮蘇阻撓　韓駐華代表促聯合國迅建南韓政府</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿四日電〕聯合國小型大會今日開始辯論朝鮮獨立問題，美國代表傑索普　請大會對於蘇聯之抵制置諸不理而進行辦理朝鮮全國選舉事宜。據稱，聯合國朝鮮選舉監察會迅速工作以便朝鮮人民選出國會乃其職責所在。聯合國機構不可聽任蘇聯不合作政策阻撓建設自由與獨立之朝鮮。希望州聯能自俊改，准許該會遵照小型大會訓令在蘇軍佔領區同樣辦理選舉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿四日電〕二十四日美國要求聯合國小型大會命令在南韓舉行若干當地選舉。在聯合國監視下之選舉將選出三分之二，「朝鮮國民大會」之代表，此爲向獨立國民政府邁進一步。美代表傑索普稱，北韓人口約佔全國三分之一，故國大中三分之一代表席當虛位以待，渠重申美國欲使朝鮮人民迅速獲得自山與獨立之期望。渠稱：「由於委員會人力之不足，未能在各區同時舉行選舉，故不妨自南向北逐地分別舉行，我人希望此種選舉能推廣至北韓蘇佔區，否則亦可選就國大三分之二之代表，其餘三分之一人民則被剝奪推選代表參加國大之權矣。世人應知何人剝奪其是項權利者，然朝鮮之國民大會已可成立，如若願意即可與朝鮮委員會商討成立國民政府事宜矣。我人更希望此時北韓人民能參加國民政府。」傑索普向小型大會提出尖國之計劃時稱：「目前　人仍不願臆測蘇聯必將　援聯合國之願望與朝鮮人民之希望，爲何三分之一朝鮮人民不能參加選舉？如應該有選舉，則朝鮮委員會爲何不執行？」</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕韓國駐華代表團，韓國獨立黨中國總支部及京·平·津·瀋·汴·徐·穗·台。等地韓國僑民會，廿三日曾致電聯合國機構秘書長賴伊，向聯合國請願：「盼於三月一日前決定宣佈在南韓舉行普選，建立獨立政府，並盼爲實現自由選舉，儘早停止南韓之警權統治。」韓國駐華代表團發言人閔石麟氏並稱：聯合國韓國委員會之實地觀察，必有助於渠等對此事作容智之決定。</p>
<h3>三強對德問題會議同意東返荷比盧參加首先討論德在援歐計劃中地位</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿三日電〕美英法三國今日正式舉行對德之秘密會議，並同意在馬歇爾計劃中，對德國之地位，儘先予以討齣。談判開始之際，英外部公佈其拒絕蘇聯抗議此次會議之照會。該照會稱，英國已決定對所有四强不同意之點重開談判，免致「德國與歐洲之和平復興，受到妨害」。三强代表並邀請荷比盧三國，對有關該三國問題，共同參加討論。三强代表已通過以經濟問題，居議松首位。同時三强之德國問題專家將規定德國在馬歇爾計劃所佔之最後之數字。參加　議各方預料此項統計，將在三月末召開之，六國會議中，佔　軍要地位。據明確之徵象所示，三强及荷，比，盧三國將利坩此次會議，討論德國東西分裂，並交換如何草成未來另一項政策之意見，如德國分裂成爲永久性。</p>
<h3>議程六項</h3>
<p>該會將討論之其他項目如下：（一）西德在馬歇爾計劃中之角色。（二）萊茵區之管制。（三）防止德國可能侵略之安全措施。（四）賠償問題。（五）德國之政治及民間團體。在計劃中之西德三區合併爲一個經濟體糸，將根據此產生。（六）暫時領土協定。此問題將包括德國西面鄰國對德國之領土要求。某一美國外交家稱，「如在詳細辦法上不能獲致協議，吾人希望在原則上能獲致協議。吾人願此次談商，係屬非正式性質，因此尙爲數國坦白表示意見及交換意見之首次機會。」</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕英美法三强會議，在開會之初，捷波南三國已向三强會議提出抗議。另據巴黎電稱，該地外交界人士預料倫敦會議如能產生堅定的一致政策，莫洛托夫或將改變其現在的對德政策。最近蘇聯在德政策頗形躊躇，蘇聯似頗有使外長會議機構繼續活動之意。究其動機，乃爲蘇聯仍圖對西德之發展，保留發言權。柏林盟國管制當局方面之外交報告，顯示西方三强之堅決及成就，爲使蘇聯恢復參加四强合作之關鍵。美軍總司令克萊將軍及其政治顧問　飛，均具此項意見。</p>
<h3>義大利加入聯合國機構</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕義大利已正式加入聯合國爲第四十一會員國。</p>
<h3>西歐五國商締聯盟</h3>
<p>不久將召開外長會議</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕英外部發言人稱，英法已在原則上同意由兩國外長於不久的將來，會晤荷比盧三國外長，討論西歐團結的建議。惟英外部發言人表示倫敦認爲此一五國外長會議，須予審愼籌備，迄今尙無開會的肯定部署，惟開會日期並不必需於英美法三强德國問題會議閉幕後始能決定。蓋此兩會議並無必要的聯繋故也。擄消息靈通方面息，五國外長開會地點或在比國，英法對荷比盧三國之備忘錄內所建議的同盟條約形式，尙在研究之中。荷比盧亦尙在研究英法所提同盟條約之草案，雙方均尙未曾提出最後意見。</p>

<h3>柏林巴黎又盛傳美蘇密談說認史杜會晤不可能</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿三日電〕雖經美蘇雙方否認，此間仍繼續盛傳美軍總司令克萊之政治顧問墨飛，與蘇軍政府之高級政治人員一人，曾於本月初在某一中立之處，舉行非正式秘密會議，一說蘇方代表即爲蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基之主任顧問西米諾夫上校。另據巴黎「剛報」倫敦記者今日稱，蘇方代表爲索柯洛夫斯基之政治顧問馬利寗將軍。　惟該馬利寗將軍與德政界接觸時，多用喬其埃夫之名。據剛報所載之報吿稱，在會談之際，馬利寗曾同墨飛建議何不使史達林與杜魯門兩人一晤。渠並曰，杜魯門當不願赴莫斯科，史達林亦不願赴華盛頓，何不即在斯德哥爾摩會談。墨飛沉思片刻，表示由於蘇報之對美總統一再攻擊，此事殆不可能。馬利寗當表示俟華萊士當選總統後，蘇報將不再攻擊。墨飛當表示華萊士不會當選爲總統。馬利甯答以今年或許不會，但四年以後必能當選。「剛報」編者於該報吿後並加註脚稱，本報刊載此等報吿，雖似奇談，但決不怕否認。</p>

<p>胡佛縱論未來戰爭</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿三日電〕美前總統胡佛今夜在華盛頓誕辰紀念宴會中宣稱，美國被攻擊時，英國及西歐或仍保待立。此非指責其無信義，或不知感激美國於解放歐洲時曾耗無數資材。並流多量之血，而實爲歐洲各國勢分力弱，面對沿鐵幕兩百五十萬紅軍之明確事實，我人應知如有人對美宣戰，在世界上我人將無可靠之軍事同盟國，惟深信西歐聯邦可以增强和平及防禦之力量。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄（一三）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有本報編譯室</p>
<p>七二高齡第一次乘坐飛機</p>
<p>大約在魁貝克會議的時候（一九四三年八月）一部　蘇聯報紙突然提出一個觀念，就是說，美英蘇政府首長舉行會議雖因史達林專心致志於指揮東方的抗德大規模戰爭而不可能，但是外長會議很可以舉行，而且可以有效果的。</p>
<p>總統和邱吉爾同時着手硏究這個建議，並且問史達林是否他對在最近將來舉行外長會議也認爲適當。史達林在八月二十四日答覆他們兩人，說他表示贊同。他還說這個會議不應該屬於狹窄的試探性質的，而應該是一種實際準備，藉使三個政府獲致肯定的決定。他建議一點，就是準備討論的各項問題的範圍，應該事前決定。</p>
<p>總統和邱吉爾交換意見之後，於九月六日再打一個電報給史達林，其中他說邱吉爾和他對於舉行外長會議階級的政治軍事會議這個觀念，深表欣喜。雖然首相建議倫敦或者英國的其他城　作爲會議地點，總統却說他以爲一個較爲遙遠的地方來得好些。他提出卡蕯勃期加或者突尼斯，甚或西西里。他說他希望派我去參加會議，但是他不希望我如此重途跋涉，所以他將派副國務卿韋爾斯去。　兩天之後，史達林建議莫斯科爲會議地點，日期爲十月初，而於九月十一日總統表示同意。</p>
<p>那時候韋爾斯還在緬甸，並且據我接到的可靠消息，他正在寫許多信給在華感頓的朋友，說他已成爲不良待遇的犧牲者。</p>
<p>在這一類事實積聚了相當數目之後，我就去見總統。我提醒他說他和我曾同意派韋爾斯到莫斯科，是使他脫離國務院而又不致刺激大衆情緒最好方法。　爾斯認爲參與我們的計劃並不適當，而到緬甸去，並且在那裏寫信給許多人，顯然在努力把他自己描寫成功一個烈士。我並且向總統提起韋爾斯在我向他提出派他到莫斯科去的計劃時所說的話，就是說這樣去跑一趟不能有所收穫。我說我現在要反對由國務院承認他這個地位了，除非他收還應該是由他負責的這種嚴　批評，並且宣佈對國務院和政府表示忠誠。　韋爾斯一點也不做這種事情，而繼續在遙遠的地方對我和國務院作一般的批評。當和韋爾斯有密切關係的一兩家報紙繼續這種宣傳，聲稱我是蘇聯的敵人希望它的血液流盡時，我於是就到總統那裏去，並且說我竭力反對韋爾斯到莫斯科去。</p>
<p>我對總統說，會議無論在何處舉行在這裏和重慶之間的任何地方——我將親自到那裏去。</p>
<p>總統對我願意自己去這一點，立即表示滿意，並且用力地說了二三遍。同時他也頗爲驚奇。他知道我身體並不好，我已不再年輕—當時我正在七十二歲的前夕—並且我是從來沒有趁渦飛機的。</p>
<p>他不知道另一椿事實—我是多少受着一稱疾病之苦，就是怕留在狹小氣悶的地方。幾年前一個很熱的晚上，當我乘着臥車開着窗經過一條長長的隧道時，我醒轉來，發覺顯然爲炭氣或其他氣體所窒息。自從那時候，我一直怕在狹窄悶閉的地方。我對於飛機就有這種感覺，所以以前我從來沒有趁過。</p>
<p>但是我現在決定飛赴在莫斯科的外交約會，猶如一個軍官必須帶了他的部隊去作戰，不管願意或否。　我自己作此決定，並未和我的醫生或者赫爾夫人商量。　在我啓程赴莫斯科之前，我在十月四日和五日與總統舉行會議，復於六日和他同進午餐，俾就大致將在莫斯科提出的各稱計劃，檢討一過。五日，我帶史丹汀紐斯。哈克荷斯。鄧恩。麥秀烏斯和柏斯伏爾斯基到白宮去和總統作一次明白討論，當時李希海軍上將也出席參加。</p>
<p>我們同意在這次會議中我們應該作每一種努力，以謀獲致英蘇同意中國參加一個四强宣言（這是一個有關戰後各項協議的宣言，包括建立一個國際和平機構在內。蘇聯曾反對將中國包括在內—編輯人新聞服務社）。我們認爲四强這個觀念應予保持，縱使在當時因此不能獲致協議，亦所不惜。無論在現在和將來，由於它對它自己和它對英屬印度的影響，中國是太重要的一個因素，不能與之疏還。</p>
<p>至於德國，總統說他澈底贊成將該國分成三個或者三個以上的邦國，各自完成自主，但由一個郵政，交通，鐵路，關稅或者電力網相聯繫，雖然他認爲電力系統的佈置應該以大陸爲基礎。他還說新的德國邦國，應該被剝奪一切軍事活動，包括訓練和軍火工業在內。東普魯士應與德國分開，民衆中一切危險份子應該强加以遷出。</p>
<p>我們中間其他的人提出論擄，認爲分治會產生許多不良的效果，關稅聯盟的辦法或者會證明行不通，或者會成爲使德國恢復統一的一種有力工具。總統加以考慮。他說我們有誇大這些影響的傾向。</p>
<p>他說他遊歷過德國，能够講德國話，認爲他認識德國比我們來得淸楚。他堅持分治是解決的辦法。談話轉移到了其他題目上去，但在相當時間之後，總統突然同到德國問題上說，他對於德國的認識，已經是許多年以前的事情了，或許他知道德國並不如他想像的多。於是他說整側過渡時期將屬一個嘗試錯誤時期。我們可能會發現在戰後立即實行的分治辦法終將予以放棄。他認爲賠償應從人力和配備中提取。</p>
<p>羅斯福先生說荷蘭或斯干的那維亞各國的恢復似不致成爲問題，但是比利時却可能引起困難。他說李奧柏國王是做着德國的俘處，地位曖昧，英國是支持他的，因爲邱吉爾相信王室可以恢復，但是他可能對比利時流亡政府引起困難。從使此點不論，比利時是一個人爲的由兩個邦合併成功的國家，而華隆斯和弗拉孟茲傳統上是一向不和的。關於這一點，總統提出了一九四〇年間一個德國人所作的研究，其中建議由亞爾蕯斯，勞萊，盧森堡以及比利時的兩部份組織聯邦。　至於波蘭和波羅的海各國，總統說當他遇見史達林的時候，他想從高尙的道德力量向他呼籲。他會對他說英國和我們都不會在波羅的海打蘇聯的，但是爲了蘇聯自己的利益，鑒於它在世界上的地位，它應該說在戰爭後二年左右願意在波羅的海各國舉行第二次公民投票，這對它是有好處的。他認爲蘇聯雖則以爲它在那裏舉行的公民投票已成定論，引爲滿意，但是世界的其餘部份似乎並不這樣想。他以爲同樣的觀念可以適用於波蘭東部，但是該國的新疆界，將來應該稍徧於所謂寇松綫之東，以稜堡（爾伏夫）給予波蘭，並在戰爭的震憾减低之後，應該舉行公民投票。</p>
<p>羅斯福先生覺得波羅的海走廊——基爾和海峽——都可以設立一個自由地帶，中國際管理，類似的地帶也可以爲蘇聯在波斯灣設立。</p>
<p>十月七日在一個陽光普照的中午，我到華盛頓飛機塲，趁一架飛機到莫斯科——這是我第一次踏　飛機。</p>
<p>這是一架　引擎　　輸機，後面隨着兩架類似　飛機，其中大部份是陸海軍人員。</p>
<p>在我上飛機之後，梅葉司令指給我看幾個緊急出口，預備在飛機「觸着」水面的時候使用，他是由海軍派來管理飛機上的氧氣的。我說飛機上有好幾個出口的事實，使我想起田納西地方一個養三隻貓的老年人的故事。一天，一個朋友去拜訪他，發覺在前門的底下有三個半圓形的洞。</p>
<p>他問道：「這些做什麼的—？</p>
<p>答覆是「讓我的貓出去」。</p>
<p>「但是爲什麼一個還不够它們用呢」？</p>
<p>這個老年人用力地反駁說，</p>
<p>「因爲當我說一聲「一齊出去」，我的確是要它們「一齊出去」的」？</p>
<p>我們第一步是到　斯德柏姆海岸。在喬治亞上空，飛機必須飛到一萬英尺高，而在八千英尺我就被戴上了　氣而罩。年老的人對於高空飛行的反應是不會良好的，容易引起心臟病發作，但是我並不覺得不舒服。</p>
<p>翌晨，我們的第二步就到了布托里科的聖約恩。我們就在那裏趁了「孔雀」號巡洋艦經大西洋到北非去。</p>
<p>我們在卡蕯勃朗加上岸。我們的國外服務官員飛　接我，他是北非處理政治　務　。我立即被到飛機塲去。飛機已經同時飛了大西洋，於是我們再上飛機。</p>
<p>在我到　爾傑爾這一段飛行中，墨飛是伴我們一起走的，並且就他對於北非和義大利局勢的一般印象，給我一個槪括的敍述。在阿爾傑爾，我和艾森豪　爾進餐。他是特地從義大利趕來的，他的人格和信心給我的印象極深。戴高樂也來訪我。我們舉行了一次長久而相當坦白的談話，並未獲致任何決定。戴高樂比我想像中更友好些，但是他極大的政治野心在我看來似乎躍躍欲出。　我們在夜間從阿爾傑爾飛赴開羅。我睡得相當好。翌晨，我啓程飛赴伊朗的德黑蘭。</p>
<p>英國外相艾登打電報給我，建議在到莫斯科去之前他和我先在開羅舉行初步會議。我國答說我們的蘇聯朋友一般地說來相當會疑心的，而會認爲在開始和蘇聯討論之前，英美彷彿在形成一個共同政策。但是當我到德黑蘭的時候，艾登依他自己的時間表，也差不多同時抵達。我們就互知致　，隨便談了幾句，並未進入眞正的討論。</p>
<p>在德黑蘭，兩個蘇聯飛行員上飛機來。我們的駐蘇新大使哈里曼也來參加我們，一直和我們在一起。　我們在十月十八日一個寒冷的下午抵達莫斯科，當時太陽正在落山。莫洛托夫和李維諾夫，以及我國戰時生產局長納爾遜和大批其他官員在機塲歡迎我們。莫洛托夫和李維諾夫向我熱烈問候。於是我就驅車赴美國大使館。</p>

<h3>參議大會第二日吳市長答覆質詢　依法辦選舉並爲見到舞弊情形物價高漲地方政府難以負全責</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第五次大會昨日下午繼續舉行第二次會議，首由各參議員向吳市長提出關於一般性問題之質詢，當即由市長一一答覆，共歷一小時。縱即由財政，敎育，地政三局局長分別報吿工作概况。報吿畢由參議員對財政局提出質詢，經田局長答覆。又對地政局質詢，以房租標準一問題發表意見最多。祝局長亦加以同答。至敎育局質詢及局長答覆，因時間不及，延至今日下午繼續。</p>
<p>昨日開會時間本定二時，但至二時廿分，到會者尙不足法定人數，議長即宣布先舉行座談會。至二時五十分始正式會議。各參議員首先提出向市長質詢之一般性問題，爲：邵永生問，（一）紙店所存之紙爲營業所需，而未經調査，政府即將其車至警局，此實係危害人民私有財產，後雖發還，但車來車去，其中如有損失，應由誰負責？（二）某烟紙店主以多年積蓄購置白銀，並不以此營利，何以將其沒收？市長答：目前經濟問題，最難處置，但此係中央整個之計劃，地方政府之責任較小，本身並無權力。在漲風起時，應付不能不採緊急措施，實行時未能週到，本人感到慚愧。關於紙店存紙一案，當局並未將紙車走，僅係査帳，如係囤積居奇則送法院辦，後査出並未違法，隨即取銷處罰。儲藏白銀一案，係奉財部命令調查，權在財部。</p>
<h3>亨鼠牌猖獗非不加注意</h3>
<p>張中原問，交易所中「亨鼠牌」是否係合法組織，市府何以不加制止？市長稱，亨鼠牌即所謂塲外交易，當局竭力想撲滅，但未能澈底辦好，並非不加注意。姜豪問：（一）本市辦理選舉，發生極不愉快之事，尤其是立委選舉，投票並不踴躍，而結果何以票數如此多？吳市長爲選舉事務所主委，應負責。其內幕究竟怎樣？有未命令下屬作法令以外之事，有未加以檢舉舞弊者？（二）物價高漲，市府有何整個辦法在事前防止？（三）節約至令，究竟做了些什麼？能否以統計數字報吿？市長答：（一）選舉全按選舉法辦理，由各區分發市民，本人對此亦極重視，曾派市府參事四人監視，但人力有限，監視者在塲時並未見到舞弊情形，不在塲時可能有此種現象發生，但個人絕未命令下屬違法。依中央解釋發出多少票，在收回時不超過原數即屬合法。（二）對防止物價高漲之整個辦法，自有中央決策，地方政府難以完全負責。（三）就節約而言，酒菜價格已竭力抑低，並未照酒菜業所訂者。而禁舞一則，本人無可解釋，乃中央命令。</p>
<h3>米價無權決定</h3>
<p>嚴國棟謂，配給米價一定要限制，若跟市價上漲，即迭成不良影響。至三個月或半年調整一次。市長表示此係中央規定，本市無權定價。趙仰雄提出：（一）市府應嚴懲毆辱市長之兇手，以後任何一事發生前，應使直接主管有施展其處理餘地，至不能解決時，再由市長作最後解決。（二）救濟特捐，上海何時成立委員會，可立即成立否？市長有何强制執行辦法？市長先對參議員問情表示感謝，繼謂，對兇手民事部份，因受傷不重，不願起訴，刑事部份由法院辦理。並答稱：救濟特捐委員會將　本星期五開第一次會議。黄振世間，中央銀行存款利息提高可助長漲風，能否與中央交涉？答，此點非市府責任可及。又楊公庶表示希望房租標準要合理調整。王維駰表示統計第四次大會一〇七件決議案中，各局已辦及正在辦者佔百分之四十三，未辦者百分之五十七，問何故？市長答，市府均盡力執行，其有本辦者，實因實際困難，均送交大會說明理由。</p>
<h3>教育局長報告將增設中小學</h3>
<p>敎育局長李熙謀工作報吿主要各點：（一）國民敎育，現有私立小學九百所，市小二六九所，共有學生三十五萬七千八百人，係全市學齡兒童百分之八十强。尙有十萬左右兒童不入學者，敎育局正在調查理由。其中有一部分爲家長經濟負担不起，亦有係童工，家長不准其上學。國民小學擬在本年秋季大量增加二百至三百班。最近已籌備就緒將開辦者，有澳門路及膠州公園旁二國民學校至老閘區一校未設，確是事實，乃因找不到公地或有私地出售而不宜建校。現該區區公所擬獻校，則不久將來至少可有一所。（二）中等敎育，本年擬興建者有吳淞中學，洋涇中學，及新陸師範三校。籌備中者有楊樹浦及新涇二中學。將來設立中學，擬在職業敎育方面發展。（三）社會敎育，民衆學校共有一八九所，補習學校一一三所，共計學生三萬七千多。以後計劃在工廠及商店方面推廣。推行國民體育將在公園內闢簡單之運動塲。此外擬建設美術館，圖書館，博物館各一所。（四）一般敎育，李局長對市校進修費一項，鄭重聲明絕對不准强收。至建設費，希望收取後每學期能建新校舍一所。此次辦理統一獎學金，擬以三千名額全部供郊區學生申請。對於不合法之敎育團體，則竭力取締。</p>
<p>又爲使家長對學校取得聯絡，教局特提倡每校舉　家長會。又對學校環境儘量改善，使學生對學校感到興趣。</p>
<p>對敎育局之質詢與局長答覆，因昨日時間不及，將延至今日下午繼續。</p>
<h3>今日議程</h3>
<p>今日議程爲：下午二時至六時，參議員對敎育局質詢，局長答覆。衛生，工務，公用等三局局長工作報吿·參議員質詢，各該局長答覆。</p>
<h3>工潮學潮處理得宜　大會中決議嘉慰四首長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日大會散會前，潘議長提出臨時動議，由徐副議長，杜月笙，金潤庠，奚王書，高叔安，陳保泰等十餘參議員共同連署，案由爲「吳市長，宣司令，兪局長，吳局長處理工潮，學潮措施得宜，擬請大會嘉慰」。經大會一致贊成，決議授權議長副議長代表本會致勞之意·吳市長等當時均在塲，特起立謙辭，表示身爲地方負責人，處理事件乃本份內應做之事，故不敢當受慰勞。</p>
<h3>祝局長說明　訂立房租標準經過　土地登記什九完成地價稅徵二八四億</h3>
<p>地政局長祝平報告工作，特說明訂立房租標準經過，謂府在事實及責任雙方面，對於房租標準皆不能不予研究訂立草案。去年八月以後，現行房租即有標準，乃依公敎人員薪金倍數八成計算，即一千四百倍。十月份增爲三千二百倍。但今年情形不同，公敎人員薪金按生活指數計算，則去年實行之房租倍數當亦不能適用。因此地政局於一月份起着手硏究，根據臨參會決議「兼籌幷顧」之原則，邀請各機關代表徵求意見。首先決定標準必須要定，但固定之倍數很難確立，後找出一標準之標準，即公敎人員房租按指數一成即八千五百倍計算。但一般性者較難解決，後由市商會等召集座談會，決定將後三個月房租按前三個月工人職員房屋類指數平均數計算，每三個月公布一次。至文化人員及貧民之房租，亦與公敎人員同。如此則已顧到多數平民，而對於經濟力量寬裕者亦不至苛待。</p>
<p>關於土地登記，截去年底止，經査完者達百分之九十以上，尙在審査中者計一萬餘件。去年度地價稅共征得二八四億强，超過核定配額百分之九十以上。</p>
<h3>參議員紛提質詢房租標準嫌過高</h3>
<p>參議員對於地政局之質詢，多數涉及房租標準問題，且均表示反對。張中原謂，房租標準定爲三萬四千一百倍，實在過高，且與實際調査結果不符。民社黨參議員江浩然稱，房租標準應按最低數額，目前房租倍數尙朱漲到如此高之倍數，當局反先予增高，此於「安定第一」有何幫助？馬君碩引證房租條例及土地法稱，房租按指數而定，實無法律根據。范守淵表示房租標準定了最高額，此最高即自然變成了最低額，因沒有一房主肯在最高額以下收房租的。又錢頌平問郊區公地淸理情形。虞舜問土地申報何時完成。</p>
<p>祝局長對於「房租問題」，再作解釋並答覆稱：房租標準最高額乃中央規定擬訂。一經通過自必嚴格執行。倍數定得少當然也可以，但市民不遵守亦是徒然。至曾安定社會，此即所以訂此標準之原意。蓋有一合理標準，即可减少許多糾紛訟案。又立法院規定按當地經濟情形訂立標準，故可說並非無法律根據。祝局長復解釋所謂三萬四千一百倍之數並不準確，並無如此之高，其實在計算法應如下：例如一·二·三月之房租，乃以十·十一·十二·三個月之工人職員純房屋指數平均數計算。在一·二·三·三個月內之房租不變動，至四月份始開始調整。至此開會時間已過，潘議長亦補充說：房租標準問題時市府有交議案，儘可等討論提案從長計議，目前其倍數究竟多少，還未正式宣佈。至此質詢遂吿結束。</p>
<h3>教職員學生請願獲滿意答覆散去</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日前往市參議會請願者達十餘起之多，中有本市公私立中小學　　　，學生，家長等約三百人，給　要求配給實物，提高待遇，進　費一次發給，年終獎金立刻發下，生活指數按月調整，减低家長負祖，免减費學額應由政府負責，反對向學生要進修費，提高敎育經費至百分之三十五等多項。後經敎育局李代局長，參議會代表童行白，蔣紀周三人接見請願代表邵爽秋等七人，並由李代局長作懇切之答覆稱：關於一二兩項，乃中央行政措施，地方當局無權過問，至於籌募統一獎金，以期增加免費額問題，此爲本　熟心人士自動捐助，並非是責任，惟本人身負管理敎育之重責，對有志求學之靑年，自當愛護，現決定凡私校免費額有超過百分之廿五者，均由敎局設法負責，予以補救，凡學生實屬淸寒而成績優良者，函請敎局經査明後，決准予免費入學。私校收費超過額將親往各校調查，一律着令發還，並將懲治·各校如對教員薪金有無故緩發或扣發時，可向敎局吿發，決予査辦·最後並希各敎員安心從事敎育，請願之教員學生等對上項答覆，均　滿意，至六時許散去。</p>
<p>又天目路居民再度要求收回拆屋成命。上海市酒菜業公會要求將筵席稅减爲百分之五，最多不得超過百分之十二·</p>

<h3>財政局長報告　本年度稅收可逾四萬億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政局長田永謙報告，三十六年全年收入之增加，均勉能應付支出之增加。然今年則不同，營業稅中，中央辦特種營業稅，抽去百分之二三·三九，製造業稅收减半，則損失百分之一七·三一。中央另抽三成，則總計本市所能收之營業稅僅百分之四二。而禁舞損失佔娛樂稅百分之一六·五，酒吧損失一二·五，菜館設有舞池者損失共計百分之三〇。本年度稅收如照中央新訂增加稅率，則可收四萬三千億元。局長表示其本人絕不主張加稅。</p>
<p>關於財政質詢者，有致富報告營業稅舞弊情形謂，一般商號時有局內人員前來談判，記由報表即將發出，如欲少報，可代爲疏通，然需手續費，此手續費乃按每月行莊拆息計算，各人一半。此項事件已成公開秘密，現本市有商號六萬餘家，平均每家一千萬，則數即可觀，請問財局如何處置？李文杰表示希望財局對用錢應注重。虞　請市府向中央請求補助，而少將地方收入抽去。</p>
<p>田局長答覆，局方對於收稅舞弊，決竭力防止，本人對史參議員所述，並未知情，但決誠意接受，如調査屬實，決定嚴辦。</p>
<h3>江灣越獄日戰犯弋獲　中野久勇先圖逃往蘇北匪區因無旅費返滬落網</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據確悉：去年十二月十四日深夜，日本戰犯前崇明憲兵隊特高科長中野久勇，自江灣戰犯監獄，越獄潛逃無蹤。事發後爲南京將主席所聞，大爲震怒，乃下令將戰犯監獄典獄長鄒任之撤職查辦，已於日前解京聽候處分，一面由國防部下令將該越獄戰犯通緝歸案。本市某軍事機關於接獲命今後，即派員分頭出動，經十餘日之偵査，終於昨日下午將該中野久勇拘獲歸案。據初步偵訊，該犯於越獄後竟擬逃赴蘇北共區，但於抵達嘉定後，因言語不通，旅費　着，又折返上海，在蘇州河北一帶流浪，以偸竊汽車零件及棉花爲生，現捕獲後暫送警局覊押。某軍事機關已電呈國防部報吿並請示處置辦法。</p>

<h3>東北心臟的邊緣</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十四日航訊〕玻璃窗上如化石般的冰紋圖案消失了，樹頂上的雪帽脫下，枝頭流着快樂的眼淚，烏雅啦啦啦的啼呌，表示牠內心的喜悅，說明春天就要來了。</p>
<p>瀋陽開始在冰裏融解，馬路上泥深三尺，可以和霧重慶媲美。有些地方變成靜靜的湖面，一陣風來，你可以吟出「瀋陽春水生」的詩句。遍街的馬糞，到處顯露着垃圾堆的面目可憎。瀋陽傑一支在熔化討蠟燭，牠已失去了冬天的光輝。</p>
<p>渾河南岸砲聲</p>
<p>春節前後的瀋陽，顯出無比的蕭條，這是光復後第三個春節了。在舊正初一的一犬，空氣顯得活潑些，人們保守着古老的傳說祝賀新年，見面作揖打拱，嘻嘻哈哈，「恭喜發財」，三五句後，便會嘰嘰咕咕『家鄕景况」了。瀋陽成了難民的世界，數達十萬人以上，並且逐日在增加中。街頭的乞丐也增加了數倍，老頭子訴說他的家產被淸算光了，小孩子，近着你喊大爺，他們趁着春節希望吃一口飽飯。防守司令部三令五申，禁止春節燃放爆竹，但在舊歷元旦的一天，渾河兩岸傳來隆隆砲聲，孩子們奇怪，是誰家大胆放爆竹呢？這眞是時代的幽默。</p>
<p>正視戰火延燒</p>
<p>緊凑的砲聲微微震動了瀋陽，瀋南鎖鑰遼陽陷匪，在靜靜的人心中投下一塊石子。潘陽的圍攻形勢，雖使人憂心，然而沒有像去年五，共匪「五次攻勢」時那種歇斯底里的恐嚇狀態。東北已經歷一個苦寒的冬天，人們的態度已變爲嚴竣堅毅，對當前　困難環境，由感情的輕浮判斷過渡到理智的冷靜考驗了。事實的挑釁，適足以鼓舞勇氣，今天人們正視戰火燃燒到這東北心臟的邊綠了。</p>
<p>懷念駱駝部隊</p>
<p>東北剿匪總司令部的成立，是東北人民最關心的重大事件。東北所熱切期待的是派遣勁旅，增强東北軍事，挽救當前危機，尤其是維持關內外交通。現在一般人還懷念傅作義的駱駝部隊，談到范漢傑　機械化兵幽，更不禁眉飛色舞。</p>
<p>人口紙煙交流</p>
<p>瀋陽最困難的問題是交通，空運是對關內的唯一道路，中國　央兩航空公司雖然每日有三五架飛機航行於平瀋之間，仍不敷　陽的需要，比起火車來，空運力量實在可憐，一個月走兩三十人，還不滿一列火車。瀋陽要走的人很多，瀋陽爲了武裝自己，希望願走的人都走了，這裏需要的是糧食，不是人口。瀋陽裝出去的是人口，運回來的是紙烟，然而牠極端需要的確是麵粉，這種不調和的現象，引起很大的反感。</p>
<p>外僑願意受苦</p>
<p>陽碟生最不易，外僑也于有所感覺。許多白俄，德國人，彼蘭人，捷克人的生路，都沒落了，流通券三千元一斤的高梁米很使他們苦惱，他們最近忙着找門路，　飛機票。一位德籍老人說：這種痛苦，是他只有在第一次世界大戰結束時的德國才嘗到過。他在戰後離開德國，一直痛恨它，談到納粹，他的脾氣就更不好了，他恨死希特勒的黨徒們。他說二次大戰後被割裂的德國也沒有什麽希望，他願意繼續在中國受苦。這老人的悲哀，使我想到在地球上受難的不只我們中國人。</p>
<p>驢肉馬肉充斥</p>
<p>靠近瀋陽城的鄉縣，擾攘不安，戰事的來來去去打打停停，老百姓沒有辦法好想，比較有積蓄的，多半同　陽城跑，瀋陽城關的房子，都塞得滿坑滿谷，租價和賣價，相併上漲</p>
<p>鄕農的牛馬，有些被雙方徴用拉走了，有些怕遭損失命運，又大半趕到瀋陽的騾馬市，以低廉價錢賣出去，好多買牲口的人，不問牲口年齡，只看瘦肥與否，據說：這些被買走的驢馬，下　湯鍋」了。不是嗎？熟肉市上充斥着驢肉和馬肉。</p>
<p>雞鴨豬狗遭難</p>
<p>鄕農另一個出賣耕御騾馬的原因，是草料貴了，因爲好多餵騾馬的草料，被人輾轉勒索變賣自肥了——鷄鴨豬狗，也遭到同一命運，沒有力量，把它們養活到春耕的時候，何况能否春耕，又大　問題呢？</p>
<p>鄉村窮困，城市艱窘，瀋陽和週遭，同遭苦難，吃食高，百事用錢多，交通斷阻，益增漲風，這裏有約合法幣八十萬元一斤的橘子，有約合法幣八九萬元一斤的大米，高糧米賣到了一斤合法幣六萬元，猪肉一斤合法幣廿四萬元，鷄蛋一個合法幣三萬六千元，男子理一次髮，要用法幣廿四萬元，生活怎能不窮迫。</p>

<h3>丁錫山匪部之覆沒</h3>
<p>〔本報奉賢廿二日訊〕土共丁錫三匪部，此次在本縣錢橋鄕屬石橋頭地方海灘，偸襲登陸，被我國軍有力勁旅，曁各縣鄉鎭保安隊自衛隊之園剿夾擊，終於在十八日，在澱山湖附近，將該匪全一部解決，匪首丁錫三，當塲格斃·業經本縣當局，派員前往指認證實，並聞決將其首級提解來奉，懸之示衆，茲將記者自有關方面，所得此次浦南圍剿經過，就各報尙未發表者，作一較有系統之記述。</p>
<p>據十七日自首之匪部參謀長，即丁匪之甥王榮，吿往訪記者。在去年陰曆十二月廿八日，丁匪率部自蘇北斗龍港出發，坐一大船，另一小船，浮海而來，人數祗六十餘，携有輕機五，步槍廿，湯姆生十，各式手槍儿，手溜彈一二〇〇枚，子彈在一萬發以上，預定大除夕登陸，偸襲奉賢，但因潮汎關係，直至年初二，在錢橋鄉西石橋頭海　拋錨，初三晚上八九時許，方上岸，因手溜彈携帶不便，埋在海灘，是夜上岸即至本邑西南境潘家角地方歇足。翌日日——十三即圖侵擾南橋，丁匪來時，携有黄金十八兩，以充給養，並自以爲憑其過去聲勢，在浦南登陸後，即可創立基地，號召舊部，故其預定目的，（一）爲收繳本縣自衛隊之槍支，（二）號召舊有丁之部屬，（三）招收新兵，（四）爲被捕被難同志復仇，（五）籌集糧餉。幸賴本縣奚縣長，及駐軍戒備嚴密，情報正確，故一得密報匪踪，奚縣長立即調動縣堡安隊，南橋柘林等地國軍，莊行子隆等鄕鎭自衛團隊，於十三日下午，分路包抄圍剿。匪猝不及防，紛紛拋棄背囊，向西潰竄，我當局除派隊跟踪搜索外，並電報警備司令部，區保安司令部，分派有力勁旅，分途堵截搜剿，奚縣長整日夜手提電話，聽取報吿，指揮作戰。</p>
<p>到十五日那天，該股殘匪，又在本邑邊境迎龍廟地方發現竄擾，即由奚縣長親率保安自衛　隊，並會同國軍××團，馳往圍剿，同時松江三區保安部朱副司令長忠，亦親自率隊前來會剿包抄，匪無喘息之機，卒被我軍將匪擊潰，落花流水般的分兩股西竄。一股十廿人，由匪部副司令湯景延率帶竄擾烟墩頭王家埭。迨我保衛團隊　報圍剿，匪已化整爲零，乘隙渡浦西竄。另一股殘匪四五十人，由丁匪親自率帶，圖竄澱山湖，卒被我各路國軍有力部隊，及各縣區保安自衛團隊，完成包圍，四面夾擊，終於十八日，將該股殘匪，全部解決。匪首丁錫三，當塲格斃，捷報傳來，人心大快。</p>
<p>此次丁匪竄擾浦南，能於最短期內，全部殲滅，固基於國軍有力部隊，及各地保警衛團隊嚴密連絡，情報迅確，士氣振奮，努力圍剿，而本縣奚縣長，在匪未立穩之際，能提高警覺，指揮若定，先予匪以猛烈打擊，亦爲此役中不可湮沒者也。</p>
<p>丁匪原爲本縣鄔家橋鎭人，（前報刊莊行，實誤，）戰前原爲一綁匪，廿五年因綁案入獄，直至抗戰軍興，丁始出獄，參加游擊隊，活躍浦東南，嗣又投僞任僞師長，駐浦江南北，聲勢浩大，後被敵偽調至紹興，企圖反正被敵日覺察下獄，嗣得機越獄而出，轉入自由區。勝利前，丁率部進駐奉賢，復員整編，改入交警隊，派駐靑島，去夏因案爲國防部明令通緝，丁即秘密投匪，嘯聚舊部，赴蘇北匪區受訓，丁匪生性剛愎傲慢，反復無常，又匪參王榮，十七日自首後，現住縣警局，據其自述，去年自張祥和匪案發後，因有牽連關係，轉輾逃至上海南京　州邳縣等地，後又回滬，即由丁匪命其同行，當時係以去山西相騙，並謂總司令馬志超亦同去，乃趁帆船出口，直至蘇北匪區方知，渠到蘇北後，初無職銜，繼被派爲「營長」，出發時，又派爲參謀長，匪部生活，每日兩粥一飯，每月祗一千二百元「華中銀行」紙幣，渠因生活不慣，並不願留一臭名，故於錢橋上岸後，即託詞回家安排，於初四日（十三號）離開匪部，設法向當局自首。（本報通信員王劍秋）</p>

<p>像「俑」這類年代久遠的粗陶器，在西安的古玩店裏並沒有被放入玻璃窗櫥的資格。出土了，依然一堆堆疊在椅桌的地下。一位內行人說：這種不値錢的古物，是很少有假的。故林森主席就喜歡收藏這一套。所謂秦磚漢瓦，西安附近出土的雖然不斷　外流，然至今仍保有許多。磚和瓦的文字·花紋·圖案，實値得我們欣賞。談到古鏡背後的圖案，那更加複雜多樣。最近，有一位收藏家在春節展覽了數以百計而每個不同的古鏡，就算我們不當它是漢唐之品吧，那精美的圖案亦往往令人讚歎不止。零星出土的石刻，有時也有高度的美術價値。</p>
<p>記者在同一古物展覽塲中發現了一具年代未詳的殘缺約有三尺高，額前頭髮高卷，兩鬢散披於兩肩，胸前衣飾半裸，乳部作誇張的膨大，和腰部作誇張的窄小恰成一對比，（兩乳頭亦强調地凸出），體型的綫條至骨盤局部才再放寬，下裾衣紋有「圓味」，更巧妙的是膝蓋以下兩條小腿全裸。可惜脚板部份殘缺了，不然，說不定再來一對穿高跟鞋，那才是百分之百的「摩登伽」呢！——由此可知，所謂「時裝」者，不渦是在年代中循環打轉，周而復始吧了。　陝省歷史博物館，就在著名的「碑林」之內，收藏亦頗豐富，但直至目前還不公開。記者參觀後最感興趣的是那些「俑」和「冥器」，右機會時，當另文報導。（本報記者馬葉）</p>

<h3>西安春聯一封道盡房客苦況</h3>
<p>〔本報西安十九日航訊〕西安房荒，市府頒佈的租金標準條例，怕祗有市府公產的住客才享到它的好處。今年大正月，號稱西安「華爾　」的「鹽店街」廿八號貼出一對天下僅見的春聯，就道出了此間房租問題的嚴重。春聯的兩邊這麽寫着：「我們住房太得貴」「租錢要漲十四倍」。門楣上横寫着「住不起」三字。</p>
<p>記者今天到那門首拍照，主人楊筱階拱手出來，打着山西腔，對記者談房租漲得豈有此理，他又說：「我是申報老讀者，麻煩麻煩老申報訴訴苦。」（本報記者馬葉）</p>

<h3>最後連中二球　仁餘勝青白四分　上半時仁餘一分佔先</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽昨日有甲組三塲，惟健身房內燈光因綫路損壞，昏黯不明，第一塲健樂對體聲，雖照常舉行，第二塲晨友對美空軍，臨時宣吿改期，嗣經電力公司派工匠到航修復，第三塲仁餘與青白之戰，照常舉行，角逐結果，仁餘力取靑白，健樂大勝體聲。仁餘靑白之戰，勢均力敵，競爭甚烈。最後數分鐘一再平手，疊見各卅四，卅七，卅九之平等局面，難解難分，仁餘由王槐庭姚文彝連中，才以四分定勝局，四十三比卅九。上半時分數亦兎起鵑落，極度緊張，仁餘以廿七比廿六僅多一分。健樂勝體聲，八十比四十九，完全一面倒。</p>
<p>仁餘　力勝青白</p>
<p>仁餘對靑白，於七時半照常舉行，由金伯陶祝明星任裁判，開賽後，靑白陳祥龍先破籃圈，仁餘吳新運梅開二度，沈鵬舉徐仲己加上二隻，以八對二前領，徐亨建功，靑白呌停，仁餘又增三分，祥龍二投二入，蔡演雄葫蘆依樣，追至十二對十三，吳新運遠射破籃，青白汪均炳陳祥龍，雙營齊下，青白以十六對十五首次超出，達雲揮入，仁餘呼停，惟靑白仍佔先着，廿二對廿六時，仁餘三元連中，各廿六平手，祥龍犯規王槐庭一罰而入，上半時適告結束，仁餘以廿七對廿六佔優一分。</p>

<p>健樂　大敗體聲</p>
<p>甲二Ａ健樂對體聲之仗，在暗淡燈光下進行，由周懷邦鄭志芳執法，健樂日前遭綠林痛擊後，昨諸老將拚命力戰，大顯威風，尤以金堃張顯崙二人，更見活躍，金獨獲三十分之多，殊爲難得。接觸之後，體聲一度以六對二領前，然不久即被健樂超出，體聲二呼暫停，仍未見效，十三對十二後，健樂一氣連獲十四分，上半時結果，體聲以二十對四十落後一半。易籃後，健樂仍控制全局，體聲湯銘新陳文藻命中甚多，無奈得不償失，迨鐘聲響處，健樂以八十對四十九大敗體聲。</p>

<h3>社會局決自今日起無限制拋售食米　昨米市情形混亂叫價再度猛升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日米價波動劇烈，社會局決定自今日起，恢復在市塲無限制拋售食米，供應市民需要。拋售價每石爲二百二十五萬元，門售價以加百分之六合法利潤計算。同時並令各零售米號一律須標明價格，由警局派員至各區巡査，如有違反，定予嚴懲。</p>
<p>米市昨南市登記到貨三三五一石五斗，北市三五三三石五斗。各方認爲當局放寬限價，行市在理可因此平穩。但因無錫各區價格暴漲，客戶恐售出後無法補進，遂扳持不放，致貨樣絕跡，市况混亂，交易幾陷停頓。本街米號則因配米停止，市上無貨添補，遂不惜加價收進，但僅有少數做開。加以受其他物價上漲刺激，人心浮動，呌價再度猛升。特白粳越二百五十萬元新高價，較上日軋升一成以上。</p>
<p>麺粉漲勢如脫韁之馬，一發不可收拾。錫價之報漲，是最激人心的一環，廠方不肯開售，更是刺激粉市上騰的主因。貨主漫天喊價，仍不乏受主。晨開老車粉即高至一百三十二萬元，兵船粉一路猛升至一百三十萬之新紀錄後，散戶獲利趁高了售，勢方轉定。老車粉以一百二十九萬收盤，兵船粉以一百二十八萬元收盤，較昨市幾漲達一成半。麩皮買戶不寂，晨開七十九萬元，一度升至八十三萬元，最後因粉市微落，而以八十萬元收盤，較昨市軋升三萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧黄豆以米價狂漲，產價報升，客帮儘量吸納，漢口乍豆，晨開爲一百五十五萬元，以後無法搜羅，遂提高至一百六十萬元。苞米晨開因靑島帮需求不乏，啓東苞米，做一百七十八萬，計昂十五萬元，後以一百八十五萬元收盤，差高二十餘萬元。紅糧菉豆俱升十五萬至二十萬元。芝蔴津帮有吸，漢口白蔴做三百四十萬元，升三十萬，九江奶蔴，開二百九十五萬元，升二十萬元。生仁猛漲二十萬至三十萬元。</p>
<p>食油在米價及各糧俱報狂升下，及無錫價格不斷報漲，加以銀根鬆濫，業外游資不無滲入，漲勢更如瘋狂，日創高價。昨市更爲劇烈，市勢反常，市上售戶稀，購貨爲一大難事。貨主喊價驚人，吉桶生油以六百六十萬之高價成交，猛奔八十萬元之鉅，達一成半，豆汕初開五百八十萬元，一度曾抵六百萬大關，後低爲五百九十萬，軋升六十二萬。生菜蔴油各漲六十餘萬，交易因售少而極淸，豆餅跟油價上漲，亦猛升六七萬元。</p>

<h3>美改訂黃金政策目前尙無此必要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前聯合社紐約電傳美國礦業五金工程協會主張黄金新價一事，記者特趨訪本市某經濟專家，據談：此刻美國改訂黄金政策，事實決不可能，美國戰後黄金生產，雖値工資上漲，產量仍能繼增，去年全年產量達八千萬美元，較戰前全盛時代一九四〇年之產量，幾達半數，而戰後外國流入黄金，爲數亦多，故實無須再提高金價，以刺激黄金生產。美國在援歐計劃進行時，出口無慮，更不多藉提高金價，眨低美元價値，以作商業上之競爭。近來以法國開放黄金市塲，外國對美國金市不免作種種揣測，其實世界有自由金市者，不止法國一處，而美國處境不同，實無接踵效法之必要。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市况，以紗管會對南運限制，仍予執行，並將檢査倉庫，及紗號登記等措施，人心頓覺虛軟，買戶止進轉出，本客二帮，辦胃亦懈，行情遂吿不支。四十一一支藍鳳細紗初開在九千萬關徘徊，後爲檯面帮空方乘機活動，盤低至八千九百萬元收市，較之上日猛瀉五百萬元。廿一支現雙馬吐脫較多，軋降五百五十萬元，其餘各支粗細紗，普跌自一百八九十萬，至五百四五十萬元不等。</p>

<h3>女作家烏特萊</h3>
<p>— 王玉</p>
<p>大家總該記得這女作家吧——弗蘭達，烏特萊Freda　Utley——過去曾寫過一本『日本的泥足」。在日本一面侵略中國，一面高唱親善的時候，她揭穿了她的眞相，喚起英美人士的注意。她是第一個願意帮助中國的人。這本書曾吸引了許多美國讀者。中譯本也曾風行一時。她在勝利後到重慶時，還有許多人提到這部書。</p>
<p>她生長在英國，到過瑞士，在倫敦大學硏究史學，又在倫敦經濟學院研究經濟學，頗負盛譽，後來又到蘇聯去，爲莫斯科政治經濟學院遠東問題專家之一，曾嫁過一位蘇聯同志，同居六年，直到她丈夫給秘密警察架走，才逃到美國去。她在蘇聯感到失望時，寫過一部「失却的夢」。她丈夫關入集中營後，她又寫了一部「已消逝的幻想」，敍述她一生的經歷。</p>
<p>她是個記者，當過曼徹斯特導報，倫敦新聞紀實報，讀者文摘的通訊員。在上海時，也曾爲大美晚報寫過文章。</p>
<p>她到過中國三次：第一次在一九二八年，正當國共分裂之時。第二次在一九三八年，那是抗戰的第二年，在武漢淪陷的前夜，才脫身而走，她是親眼見過中國抗日之戰的。第三次在一九四五年，先到重慶，隨後又赴延安。政協開會的時候，她正在重慶。</p>
<p>她最近又寫了一部書，名爲「美國人在華的最後關頭」，一共十六章，竭力主張美國在道義上與實際本身利益上，非立即全面援華不可。她以爲美國至少要借給中國二十億至三十億夫金，才可復興中國，她是個遠東問題專家，懂得中國的實際情形，也懂得美國人的心理，分析得十分淸楚明白。文筆非常流利，最擅長於寫政論，娓娓而談，親切有味。</p>
<p>她批評美國的外交政策，說其弱點不在不一貫，而在舉棋不定，所以無法達到其目的。美國常在緊要關頭，不肯採取强硬外交政策去阻止戰爭的發生。假使當時在日本侵略中國之初，便和她經濟絕交，後來何至再打那麽多的血仗！</p>
<p>她說美國還來得及採取一種明智的，有遠見的，切合實際州的對華政策，那便是用全力來支持中國，勿使她單獨為民主國家而作戰。</p>

<p>— 張道</p>
<p>三〇·鄭敬業的臥室（卅五年十二月）</p>
<p>敬業半他臥室裏一張沙發椅上。秀貞在她旁邊一張長條桌前坐着寫字。</p>
<p>敬業：（手裏拿着秀貞寫的字看完後。）寫的很好，以後每天一定要寫的，不要偸懶呀。</p>
<p>秀貞：好，我不偸懶。（打開抽屜拿出一張嬰孩的照片來，就是敬業當年收藏的一張。）鄭先生，這是誰的照片？</p>
<p>敬業：（驚訝。）你在那兒得來的？</p>
<p>秀貞：是你日記本裏吊出來的。在桂林的時候，我爸爸有我一張小時的照片，和這一張是一樣的。</p>
<p>敬業：（拿話混過去。）這是我朋友小孩的照片，和你爸爸有的那一張一定不一樣的。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（忽然推門進來，手裏拿着一張報。）秀貞，你說你媽媽呌甚麽名字？我忘記了。</p>
<p>秀貞：呌，呌，郭燦雲。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（很高興的。）那麼對了！（秀貞敬業都莫明其妙。）</p>
<p>敬業：（急追問。）甚麼對了？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（拿起報來念。）你聽吧！『何琦尋人啓事</p>
<p>民國三十三年十二月初敵人侵入貴州之時，內子郭燦雲携幣八歲小女秀貞逃入貴州。母女在六寨被轟炸混亂中失散，至今小女尙無下落。現鄙人夫婦已返上海，如有仁人君子，能帮助尋得小女者，　致送酬金二千禽元。何琦敬啓。住址上海安和寺路1001一號。電話99990。」（鄭太太念完以後，看着敬業。敬業帶着複雜情緒，有點發呆，秀貞則似乎還沒有完全懂得啓事的內容。）秀貞，你懂了沒有？</p>
<p>秀貞：伯母，是不是找着我媽媽了？</p>
<p>敬業：（冷靜的。）是的。秀貞-你爸爸媽媽登報找你，現在我們已經知道他們的住處，就　以呌他們來接你回去了。</p>
<p>秀貞：（很高興的樣子，但是有看敬業並不甚高興，又不敢表現出來，跑到敬業的身旁。）鄭先生，你也到我家住去，好不好？</p>
<p>敬業：（敬業很慈愛的抱着她。）好孩子，我怎麽能够到你家去住？</p>
<p>秀貞：（要哭的樣子。）爲什麼不能？你待我好，我願意跟你在一塊。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：傻孩子！你有了媽媽還不好嗎？鄭先生是要住在我們家的。妹妹，我們樓下去商量一下好吧？</p>
<p>（秀貞仍在房內，敬業及鄭太太下樓去。）</p>
<p>三一·鄭家客廳</p>
<p>敬業：（感覺十分難受，在室內坐立不安，嫂嫂也默無一言，最後決定了。）嫂嫂請你就打電話通知何家，我們明天下午就把秀貞送給他們去。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：妹妹，你決定就這樣嗎？你不要再仔細考慮一下嗎？</p>
<p>敬業：不必了，請你就打電話吧。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（試探的。）哼！二千萬元就把女兒還給他家，沒有那樣便宜。我們要一萬萬才行！</p>
<p>敬業：嫂嫂，那不可以的。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：爲什麽？</p>
<p>敬業：不爲什麽！（急爆的。）你不打電話，我自己打吧。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：我當然打。（遲疑了一回兒拿取桌上電話，再撥號數。）</p>
<p>喂！你們的電話是99990嗎？……是何公館嗎？請何琦先生聽電話。……何先生到香港去了，那麼請何太太說話也可以。……</p>
<p>三二·何琦上海新居客廳</p>
<p>燦雲正在室內打着毛綫衣，娘姨來請。</p>
<p>娘姨：太太有電話。</p>
<p>（燦雲走出門去，在樓梯旁接電話。）</p>
<p>燦雲：喂！那哩？是的。哦鄭公館，我是何太太。是，我呌郭燦雲。廣吿是我們登的。什麽？秀貞在你們那兒？（驚喜。）請問你們住在什麽地方？福開森路九一八號？我可以馬上到府上來嗎？好，我馬上就來！</p>
<p>（燦雲掛了電話。非常高興的又撥號碼。）</p>
<p>燦雲：請立刻派一部車子到安和寺路一〇〇一號何公館。快快！</p>
<p>三三·馬路</p>
<p>一部祥生公司汽車飛駛到達鄭家門前。</p>
<p>三四·鄭家門前</p>
<p>汽車停了下來，燦雲下車，付了車資，按門鈴，鄭家用人延入內。</p>
<p>三五·鄭家客廳</p>
<p>鄭太太在客　內，燦雲進客廳。</p>
<p>燦雲：我是郭燦雲。您就是鄭太太嗎？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：是的，何太太，請坐。（兩人分別坐下）</p>
<p>燦雲：（疑慮的。）鄭太太，我希望您電話裏吿訴我的，眞是我的女兒，該不會錯吧？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（笑笑）吹呀！那我可不敢包您。等我把她呌來，你自己認好了。（走在客廳後門高聲叫。）秀貞！快來！</p>
<p>秀貞：（跑下樓梯聲音，跑進客廳。）伯母，甚麼事？（才說完話，已看見燦雲，似乎不敢認的樣子。）</p>
<p>燦雲：（一見秀貞，立即認出，高興極了。跑過去，蹲下來抱住秀貞。）秀貞！你不認得媽媽了嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：（確認出了，雙手抱住燦雲的頸。）</p>
<p>媽媽！媽媽！啊！媽媽！</p>
<p>燦雲：却把媽媽想壞了！萬想不到還能找到你。</p>
<p>（母女二人充滿歡喜的熱淚。鄭太太在旁邊看着非常感動，笑而不語。）</p>
<p>燦雲：鄭太太，我眞不知道怎樣感謝您才好；剛才您打電話，我眞不敢相信，現在總算證明不是做夢了。您能把怎樣找到秀貞的經過情形吿訴我嗎？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：不是我找到他的，是我妹妹由貴陽把她帶回來的。</p>
<p>燦雲：令妹在那裏，請你介紹我見一見可以嗎？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：當然可以，不過他剛才有點不舒服，等我去看看。</p>
<p>秀貞：伯母，鄭先全　才在樓上哭了。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：啊！（出客廳上樓去了。）</p>
<p>燦雲：（問秀貞。）那一個鄭先生在哭？</p>
<p>秀貞：就是帶我回來的鄭醫生，我總是叫他鄭先生的。</p>
<p>燦雲：（會意到敬業捨不得交還秀貞。）她待你好順？</p>
<p>秀貞：她待我好得很，她愛我得很。</p>
<p>燦雲：你也喜歡她嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：我很愛她。</p>
<p>（有人下樓梯的聲音，鄭太太和敬業入客廳，看得敬業出來有些勉强，但是她仍然非常鎭靜大方。）、</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（對燦雲。）何太太，這就是舍妹鄭敬業醫生。</p>
<p>燦雲：（見了敬業有些莫名其妙的驚訝，趨前與敬業祝手。）鄭先生。</p>
<p>敬業：（鎭靜的，勉强微笑。）何太太！</p>
<p>燦雲：承您把秀貞帶回來，我不知道怎樣感謝，才好。</p>
<p>敬業：何太太，您不用那樣說。「助人爲快樂之本。』我無意中帮助您找回你的女兒，在我也是一件快樂的事；至於怎樣找到秀貞的經過，我想她能慢慢吿訴您的。</p>
<p>燦雲：（覺得有些奇怪，不知道如何是好，很難開口　說。）鄭先生，我們登報說過　致送酬金的，現在我預備了兩千萬塊錢的支票，希望你收下。（開了手皮包取出支票。）</p>
<p>敬業：（微露不快的神色。）何太太，請你不必了。我當初收養她完全爲了憐愛她，並沒有別的目的，我今天把她交還給你，使你們母女團圓，決不是爲要酬金的。</p>
<p>秀貞：媽媽，鄭先生不會要錢的。</p>
<p>燦雲：這呌我怎麼能够心安呢？</p>
<p>敬業：您不必那麼想，您要願意的話現在就可把秀貞領回去；以後我們再慢慢談吧。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：秀貞還有許多衣服在這裏，明天我們送到府上去。</p>
<p>秀貞：（忽然自媽媽身邊跑去抱着　業。）鄭先　呈共同　一齊回家去，你不去，我也不去。（說着要哭了。）</p>
<p>敬業二（慈愛的撫慰她。）傻孩子，那是你的家，這是我的家。我怎麽能同你一齊去？（說完也要吊淚了。）</p>
<p>（燦雲和鄭太太在旁看着也感覺心酸了。）</p>
<p>秀貞：你不同我去，我不去－我不去！（哭了。）</p>
<p>敬業：（也哭了。）不，秀貞，不要這樣，你先回去；我以後常常來看你好不好。你要不聽話，我以後就不來看你了。</p>
<p>秀貞：（含着淚，點頭。）好，好，我聽話。</p>
<p>敬業：好，那麼跟媽媽先回去吧。（推着她送到她媽媽面前。燦雲拉着秀貞。）</p>
<p>燦雲：鄭先生，使您感到難受，我心裏實在過意不去。，</p>
<p>敬業：沒有甚麼。</p>
<p>燦雲：那麼我們走了，明天再來奉看。（大家一齊無言無語的走到大門。）</p>
<p>秀貞：（向敬業鞠躬。）再見！鄭先生！（向鄭太太鞠躬。）再見！鄭伯母！</p>
<p>敬業：鄭嫂：再見：秀貞！</p>
<p>（燦雲母女走了以後，敬業和鄭太太返入客廳，敬業此刻再也無法控制自己的情感，竟大大的悲傷起來；鄭太太勸慰她。）</p>
<p>鄭嫂：妹妹，不要這樣，孩子當然是可愛；但是總是人家的，你以後仍然可以常常見到她的。</p>
<p>敬業：嫂嫂，你不知道，我是怎樣的疼愛這個孩子。〔未究〕</p>

<h3>兩兄弟（上）</h3>
<p>— 林野</p>
<p>—一集流行安南的故事</p>
<p>漆黑的天幕突然裂了開來，一道雪白的光綫透過了它，遊動的雲塊在光綫的前面滑了過去，漸漸地一輪月亮露出頭來。……</p>
<p>「好月色啊！」聞老伯伯拂着尺來長的鬍子，挺胸仰頭有所感慨的說。</p>
<p>這時，不遠的地方傳來了一陣騷動的聲音，夾雜了木板的碰擊聲：一羣孩子走上來了，他們都帶了許多東西來；長板凳，帆布叉凳，不捨得脫手的玩具……。聞老伯伯笑着轉過臉去，一會兒大家都把他圍在中間了。</p>
<p>小孩子嚷着要聞老伯伯講故事，他也提出條件要大家先唱一隻歌，相持之下，四五個比較大方的拍着手掌唱起來：</p>
<p>「日光光，照地塘，年卅晚，摘檳榔，檳榔香，摘紫薑，紫薑辣，摘籮蔔，籮蔔甜；可惜籮蔔收成不齊全，半壁田產遭災殃；不知戰爭何日止，安居樂業過新年？……。」</p>
<p>歌聲息止了，聞老伯伯沉吟了一會，遲緩地從椅子上站起來，把凳子略爲向一棵大樹的方向挪移過去，一個故事已在他的腦袋裘長成了。過去一些日子裏，他盡是講些戰爭的故事，好像三國爭雄，岳飛打金兵之類。但是，今天他要轉轉口味了。不過，盡管他怎樣變，大家都高興聰的。</p>
<p>——很久很久以前，有一對兄弟，和他的母親住在福建近海的小村落裏，他們因爲沒有父親，所以祗靠着兩隻手，用勞力來養活他的媽媽。哥哥呌老大，弟弟呌老二，因爲在窮苦中長大，所以養成一種孝順的德性。老大素有志氣，他希望將來能够做一個富翁，讓他的媽媽能舒適的度她的晚年生活……。</p>
<p>日子過得很快，老大已經長成一個二十歲的靑年了，他有紅潤的皮膚美麗的眼睛和頭髮，同時他唱得一口好聽的山歌……。有一天。他悄悄地和老二商量，他希望能够跟海船到外地經商，但老二祗有同情却沒有辦法帮助他。</p>
<p>老大終於求到他的母親的臉前來了：</p>
<p>「媽，讓我去吧，最多不過半年，我就能把您所歡喜的東西帶回家來……。」</p>
<p>老大終於收拾行裝準備上船了，包袱裏有許些衣服和乾糧。他那位慈祥的母親也把數年來勤苦的積蓄全部給老大做盤費。臨去的早上，大家抱頭哭泣，以淚相送。老大愼重地把　顧老母的担子交給年靑的老二，滿腔希望地踏上漫長的路程。</p>
<p>十幾天水路，終於把老大帶到一塊人地生疎的土地上來——這就是安南。翠綠的樹，鮮甜的熱帶果實，平坦的阡陌，使老大迷醉了，他以爲希望立即可以實現了。</p>

<p>希特勒勢的時候，誰也想不到德國老文豪霍普特曼會慣於納粹的生活。誰也不曾料到，霍普特曼會支持希特勒的政策，當他從國際聯萌退出的時候。他在短彼廣播裏對國外的德國人說話。想不到曾經在靑年時代向愷石挑戰的人，會在與納粹黨握手的時候感到這是他一生最偉大的時期。</p>
<p>即使是保守派，也攻擊希特勒的反猶太主義。但霍普特曼却保守沉默。其實像他這樣的地位和年高，即使爲猶太人說幾句話，也不會有生命危險的。他難道忘記了一些猶太的演員，導演和批評家，在藝術的國度裏帮助他成爲「德國的易卜生」和「德國的莎士比亞」麽？霍普特曼不竹像挪處得諾貝爾獎的哈姆生那　變成法西斯蒂，似他到底在他的生命上沾了汚點。</p>
<p>李恰特（Waller　Reichart）是米西根大學的德文敎授，新　替霍普特曼的五幕劇「黑暗」（Die　Iin　ternisse）寫了一篇介紹。劇本是用德文寫的，介紹却是英文寫的。他是霍普特曼的專家，竭力想替霍普特曼洗刷，總不能使讀者相信。</p>
<p>花爾藤的傳記</p>
<p>盧博克（Percy　Lubbock）新近出了一本「花爾藤的畫像」（Porrait　of　Edith　Wharton）。這本書不多不少，恰如題目所示，在狹隘的限制下是近十年來最完整的著作。這不是眞正的傳記，也不是文學批評，這是著名作家的畫像，十八世紀常用的方法又重見於今日。</p>
<p>盧博克說，花爾藤是一位精細的美國人，她能够看出美國十九世紀後半　物論與唯心論的鬥爭，她也是　時技巧很高的作家，堪與同爲女作家的開莎爾並稱。她受亨利·詹姆士的影響很大。她的水準很高，能够抓住婦女雜誌的無數讀者。</p>
<p>他是花爾藤的好友，他的成功是他寫了女人的她，而不是作家的她。書中也揷敍到別的朋友，又說起她在Lenot和法國的北部造了不少的房屋和花園。她是個富家之女。她不著作的時候，就種花或談話，花是種給朋友們看的，話是與朋友們分享的。</p>
<p>這本　連花爾藤時常害羞，聳肩，打鼾的習慣都寫？進去。盧博克對於花爾藤畢生的愛人白萊（WalterBerry）不大滿意。白萊是美國的國際律師。</p>
<p>書中記錄花爾藤談話之處頗爲不少。因爲她是健談的，可說是書籍，藝術，人生，哲學等，無所不談。</p>

<h3>中國人與書</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>假如一個國家的文化程度可以其書籍出版之多寡來衡量，那麽中國這個文化古國，大有列入最不文化今國之林的危險。一般說來，中國人之少讀書，是因窮，因文肓多。這自然也是一說，但我竊以爲未必盡然。中國有四五萬萬人，十中取一，其人口也比得上一個英國。難道英國人個個富有，個個敎育程度甚高，而十取一的中國人還是個個囊空如洗，目不識丁？而中英出版書籍，讀書人民之多寡比例，仍相差遠甚無疑。</p>
<p>這是中國人不喜讀書之故，亦即無求知心之徵。若干月前，我目擊耳聞過甲乙二友爲買書與買白皮鞋孰是孰非而爭。原來是日甲兄以八萬塊錢購一舊西書，乙兄以十六萬元置一新白皮鞋。甲說其書實在便宜，乙便嗤之以鼻，說一本舊書花這麼多錢還說便宜，眞是「屈死」。甲就反唇相譏，說十六萬元置一雙白皮鞋，簡直浪費。乙說鞋乃必需之品，書豈可以充饑。甲說皮鞋何必分黑白，根本上穿皮鞋就是傻瓜，舉步奇重，共隆共隆，若住樓上，必爲樓下同居所恨。還要白的黑的，更屬無聊，　則可以增知識，廣見聞，借友朋，傳子係……</p>
<p>甲兄雖喜購書，古今中外，月必三五册，但亦未嘗因之而衣不蔽體食不果腹，他的收入並不比乙兄爲多，家庭負担亦約略相等。我嘗詢以何來買書之費，他說：「容易得很。蓋我人日常用錢，有決無可省者，如柴米油鹽，有絕對可省者，如賭與嫖，右可省可不省者，如烟與酒，如三輪車與汽車，如頭輪電影與頭等理發店，以至如乙兄的白皮鞋之類，不勝枚舉。我的買書之錢就在可省可不省項下簡約出來者。例如你吸憒白錫包，何况改吸紅錫包，或一月改吸四次，省下點錢來購一書，你坐三輪車的改坐電車，看慣頭輪電影院的改看末輪或不看若干次，餘類推。這樣的節約不損毫　，而買書之錢就綽綽有餘了。</p>
<p>這話頗有道理。勸人節不可節之衣縮不可縮之食買書，或不免强人所難不合情理，但不買一雙徒資應時的白皮鞋之類以買書，應該是理所應爾，不該非議。但買白皮鞋的我友乙兄，還是書店顧客，蓋他白皮鞋固不廿不着，書亦未嘗不買不讀。尤有甚者，我還認識不少絕對並非文盲又綽有買書「游資」之士，却終年不買一書，入其室儘有冰箱電扇，麻雀僕克牌，而印黑字的白紙成。</p>
<p>於是我們得追究何以書非買非讀不可之理。書中自黄金屋顏如玉之說，當然今非昔比，已成空話，懂得了柏拉岡怎樣說，馬克思如何言，美國的民主是短，蘇聯的民主是長之類，從實利上說來，原也究有何益。不過以中國人而論，讀書　最大益處，即在於讀書而後庶能肅淸其心中的黄金屋，掃除其目中的顏如玉。蓋今日不少中國人朝人縈懷耳目濡染之　，就是　票與女人，其最高　想爲生則金　藏嬌，死後睡楠木棺材國葬。這也原屬人情之　，鄙人何敢厚非，問題是世　迫　，尙未至人手一機——用印彩票的機器——的地步，故如人人想金屋藏嬌睡楠木棺材國葬，結果必至人欲横流，你奪我搶，無復有天理人情。如何挽此狂瀾，我想多讀書亦是一法蓋書除嫖經賭與之類之外，全是古今人的不涉一己利害之談，如理想國如何建設，托邦怎樣成功，華盛頓謝兵柄之　可尊，巴士德硏究瘋狗病之多麽可貴，使你讀着　着　遊物外，想入非非，雖仍不免聞米價之劇跳而驚心，到底受了若干潛移默化作用，不至如終年不讀一書，未越眼前利害一步者，勢必至於只想到錢錢錢，甚至於唯利是岡。良以我人生存於世，若不藉幾種東西如音樂繪畫彫刻運動書籍睡覺之類，略使我們稍能超然物外神遊太虛，那麽一天到晚耳所聞目所擊者旣無一非五光十色的物質，其終至利慾薰心又何能免！</p>
<p>如曰大家如照你所說的為想入非非而讀書，豈不有人皆成爲「書呆子」之慮？則答曰如世界上有兩個國家，一爲書呆國，一為財迷國，則我竭誠願意喪失財迷國國籍而歸化爲書呆國國民。</p>
<h3>粒米五角四分</h3>
<p>— 楊文育</p>
<p>廢曆年後，食米首先昂騰，竄出二百萬關，據筆者親戚費時甚久的一個統計結果說，以二百萬元一石計算，每粒米已値法幣五角四分。他是這樣獲得結果的：整粒白米每兩約有一千五百粒，斗米十五斤七兩，則有卅七萬粒，一石米則有三百七十萬粒，所以米賣到每石三百七十萬元的時候，就是「粒米一元」，買米要按粒計算，只怕不久眞會實現。同時這位親戚又這樣試了十多次，每扒進一口飯不加咬咽就吐出來數一下，他說大人一口飯約有三百六十粒，以粒米五角四分算，現在吃一口飯就要一百四十元左右，拿十年前的情形來作比較，現在一口飯就吃下了從前的兩畝田。</p>
<h3>吃（下）</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>考古家所發現的古銅器，雖有許多種，但以食器爲　宗，即禮器之中，屬於祭宗廟或　祗的，也還是和吃有着關係的。湯盤孔鼎，蓋皆先　因吃飯而留給我們的遺產。藉此而考究了古人的生活狀况，所可惜者，尙未能詳細知道古人的葅醢烹淪，到底是怎麽樣的手緒和滋味耳。從前常奇怪古人紀功策勛，何以不像今日似的，頒給勛章之類而偏偏鑄鼎　銘，及今思之，始悟吃之問題，原屬天下晨最要之事，古人此舉，殆又比勛章爲有意義多矣。不寗唯是，古人以調和鼎鼎象徵相業，好廚子即是好內閣總理，一刀一勺，加鹽加醬，何殊乎政治上之所謂調整配置乎？國亂曰「鼎沸」，國治日「宴安」，似皆與吃不無關係，事實上也眞是，只要吃飯問題獲得解決，亂手也就不會有了，故謀國者之言日：「要大家有飯吃」。－其日「有飯大家吃」者，即革命也，最後目　，　「上家有飯吃」耳。</p>
<p>表現在外在不　　者日「折衝尊俎」，不妨先從小事說起，譬如上海白相人之「吃講茶」是也。天大仇恨，可以消於一茶一飯之中，也可以決裂於三杯落肚以後，誰能說吃飯與和平沒有關係？人與人如此，國與國亦然，你如讀過左傳，一定記得那些使於四方的傢伙，在宴會之後，賦上兩句詩，立刻就可以成立兩國間的互不侵犯條約或友好協定。范睢須賈因吃飯而成了深仇，竟會影響到國家之興亡成敗，馮諼彈鉠作歌，也是先要挑剔吃的，蘇秦刺激張儀　讓他和聽差一塊用飯，專諸刺死王僚是藉了宴飲的機會，至於像鴻門宴那樣的局面，杯酒釋兵權那樣的策略，更是中國所常有，一一一國演義　多少「擲盃爲號」，多少「兩壁埋伏下刀斧手」，可見不但一飯之恩是淮陰侯所懷念，一飯之仇，也不是好玩的事體呀！</p>
<p>在民間習俗，那便是歲時節令之吃，中國節日的對象往往是神佛，而節日的享受則是吃。目下正在過舊歷年，乃是三百六十日中集吃之大成的日子，昨天我的小孩子忽然悟到「人們過節，豈不就是猪鷄鴨魚倒楣的日子嗎」？雖幼稚而有至理。除夕那天，肉已貴到每市斤五萬，菜塲上依然萬頭鑽動！求過於供，而且，外國的期誕節，也不過弄隻把火鷄吃吃，就是舉國若狂了，我們的新年，吃的有多少種？若在全國各省市縣加以調査統計，必可以寫成一部幾百面的大書無疑。端午節，中秋節，都要大吃特吃，固不必論，即隨時小節令，如立春，立冬，冬至，夏至，入伏，出伏，元宵，上燈，落燈，……無不以吃爲代表，在吃之中，還要寓以發財之意，北方過年吃煮餑餑是象徵元寳的，南方的灶糖根本做成元寳形，謂之元寳糖也。太平歲月，臘月要吃年夜飯，正月要吃春酒，北方所謂「車輪會」，更是異常熟鬧，吉利語也格外多。記風俗的書，自荆楚歲時記至東京夢華錄，武林舊事記，吃的都占了大量篇幅，恐在外國，是少見的。</p>
<p>更怪的是語言。從前劉半晨先生曾作「打雅」，專門硏究打字的用法，認爲是中國文字的最不易了解，意義最紛歧者，戲稱之爲「渾蛋字」，蓋其解竟達四百餘條也。其實像此類字尙有若干，吃殆即其中最普通的一個：日常語言中用吃者不一而足，項特別者如「吃敗仗」「吃生活」「吃虧」「吃價」……等，又有以「吃××飯」代表某某職業的說法，如曰：吃自治的，吃慈善的，吃白相人飯的，更是妙趣環生，値得我們「深長思之」。不知有沒有學者，起而繼劉博士之後，作一「吃雅」也。</p>
<p>最近在火車上見到不少紳士淑女型的人，－特別是淑女們，從開車的時候起，到下車時止，水果點心不斷的吃，外加火車飯，咖喱飯，遇見賣包子牛肉和麻餅的還不放鬆，眞不免驚訝他們吃量之大。廣東的富人，每天連點心可以吃到七八餐，此等人，其全部生活，殆可以吃代表矣。無怪乎大家見了面，第一句話永遠是「點心吃過吧？」「夜飯吃過吧？」之類。從前被人駡爲飯桶，必致環臂怒目，此刻目前，欲道地的作一名盛飯之桶，在米價過二百萬大關之際，固亦談何容易，然則欲於此駡名副其實，正求之不得者！倒是古人常常把對方　之醢之，乃至以油鍋炸之，現在想起來豈也是年荒食艱之故乎，黄巢入長安，人肉論斤計値，可怕亦可憐。麻叔謀以吃人爲嗜好，則又當別論，求之今世，正所謂滔滔者天下皆是耳。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十一章　滿腹疑雲　七九</p>
<p>小王媽笑道：「徐先生上去吧，我已經把昨晚情形吿訴老板了，她請你上去。」渚齋一聽小王媽這樣說，心裏很是興奮，及走到樓上，剛掀開門簾，要關進綺紈臥房，却聽綺紈在　面問道：「是誰呀？渚齋嗎，請等一等。」渚齋一聽這話，立時縮回脚步，身子一轉，退回外面客室裏，心裏不由感覺一種很難堪的印象，因爲平日在綺紈家裏，穿門入戶，毫不阻止，無論綺紈在什麼地方，彼此不拘形跡，都可以隨便走進去，今天她在臥室，竟阻止他進去，平日只喊他「渚！渚！」今天竟呌他渚齋，這樣稱呼，這樣舉動，顯見隔膜了。他退出臥室，心上覺得很難過，以今天所得種種印象，在一氣之下，很想一逕回去，不再理她。在客　裏，兩手挿在褲袋內，隢着臬子旋轉，心裏忿恨交加，繞走好幾個圈兒，才見小王媽推門進來，笑道：「老板請你呢。」渚齋一腔怒氣朱平，衝着小王媽問道：「別再走到房門口，又把我趕出來、」小王媽笑道：「怎麼我的大爺！您還生氣嗎？人家等着你呢！快去快去，見而要和氣一點。我巳把昨晚你出去找她情形，吿訴她了，她聽了還流淚呢！」渚齋一聽綺紈流淚，一時把所有忿恨的心，全消滅了，連說道：「我沒生氣。」便跟了小王媽，一逕來到綺紈臥室，見她　在休上，臉朝內，身上蓋着紅緞棉被，渚齋照平日習慣，挨在牀沿坐下，一手按在被面上，問道：「你昨晚累了，不舒服嗎？」這兩句話，在渚齋原是隨口問一問，綺紈覺得很刺耳的，好似渚齊是　刺她。當他聽小王媽吿訴她的話，她心上本非常難過，種種感觸，不由流下淚來，現給渚齋無意之下，問她一句「昨晚累了？」立時又感覺到男人的心是狠的，什麽話都能說出口，當下便冷冷應了一句：「不累！」渚齋又問道：「你昨晚上那裏去？一晚沒回來，我眞不放心。一綺紈又冷冷應道：「我又不是小孩子，怕什麽呀！」渚齋連碰了兩個釘子，不由怔住。</p>
<h3>兒童的定義</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>何謂兒童？兒童是一個銀行，在這個銀行裏，你可以存儲你的最貴重的珍寳——如：你的得來匪易的智慧，你的對於使世界更好一些的夢想。你的孩子是會保存你這些珍寳的，他們也許還會好好　運　這些珍寳，得到可觀的利息。</p>
<p>你　工作成績如何，就將由今日的兒童來　斷。明天，他就來代替了你的地位。「將來」是屬於兒童的，而你今日如能對他多加　意一點，那麽「將來」也許還有你立足之地。</p>
<h3>商業道德</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>在本埠出版的某英文刊物上，讀到不署名的某君的一篇文章，對於勝利以來的國際貿易，頗有微詞。這篇文字中還引述了好幾個「有趣」的例子。</p>
<p>一九四六年六月間，有人向紐約某店定購男女皮鞋計一萬一千零六十四雙，價値美金五萬二千五百元，該貨於同年七月至八月間，先後運抵上海。其尺寸，式樣與顏色槪與樣本及定單中指定者不符，而且其中的一部份皮鞋竟有十餘年前的「樣子貨」攙雜在內。這筆交易經事後調査的發現，更令人懊喪的是：那位紐約出口商，原來才從反省院中釋出不人！</p>
<p>與上述一事大同小異的，又有定購價値美金子萬元的黑色麥爾登大衣呢一萬　，及價値美金四萬元的花呢六千碼各一起。先是，進口商指定的花呢，祗有十二種式樣，迨貨物抵滬後，打開一看，竟有一百九十種不同的花色。至於麥爾登大衣呢的情形則更糟，有的是嗶嘰，有的是平厚呢，有的是駱駝絨。據說這是一批七拼八凑的毛織物，不過全把它們染成黑色而已。</p>
<p>另一件例子是：有人在一九四六年四月向紐約某出口商定購螢光燈一萬五千隻。貨物於三個月內如數運到，然而材料惡劣，製造「搭漿」，不堪使用。最後送交其電力公司檢査的結果，不但祗可視爲廢物，而且使用時，有很大的危險。</p>
<p>此外，向紐約某出口商訂購呢帽和羊毛內衣的某本地商人，也呌苦不迭。原來進口的這一批呢帽，邊緣過狹，不合市銷，而且尺寸大者太大，小者太小，羊毛內衣雖然十足用羊毛織成，却是已被人家穿過一次或多次的舊衣服。</p>
<p>情形比較緩和的是：某商人向舊金山訂購「聖騎士」密橘一批，確係產自加利福尼亞州無疑，不過較市上發售的，要小去不少，只好貶價出賣了。</p>
<p>這裏，我們儘管可以把這些事當作國際貿易史的「逸話」來讀，關於許多不顧商業道德的行爲，却不勝枚舉。例如買整箱的肥皂會短少，塊或一條，鐵聽餅乾的底下，竟是一大團紙條和餅乾碎片，什錦糖果含有苦味，「上等」綫襪，穿了一天，就裂成一個窟窿。本來，工商業以營利爲目的，無可厚非，但是，我們認爲無論中外商人，至少應該講求一貨眞價實」！</p>
<h3>雷達</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>根據最近試驗的結果：在雷達四週半徑約二百五十英尺的區域內，攝影用的鎂光燈炮可能因雷達的影響而爆炸，甚至起火。因之裝有雷達設備的美國飛機境已　　　運此類燈泡</p>
<h3>因偽「宮」火憶偽皇</h3>
<p>— 雷園</p>
<p>見到　外長春新聞，前僞滿皇宮，光復後改爲學校之大厦一百餘　，遭祝融之厄，化爲飛灰，一塲傀儡　跡，至此蕩焉無存。</p>
<p>民國十二年之夏，溥儀尚居於北平故宮，夜　忽宮中大火，　城震駭，大明始熄，損失不貲。拙作癸亥夏興十二律（登載京報，及上海時報）中，第五首即詠此事：「家居撞破太無端。十載神州歛手看。烈炬騰空驚萬戶，故宮深夜集千官。白山黑水靈安在。止鵲興龍跡已殘，興國燎原同一器，好擎雙淚莫輕彈。」和者甚多，泰州顧有義句云：「一炬安知非福命，十年早策是荒墟！」代帝持樂觀，意新而詞警，確有道理。</p>
<p>溥儀三歲登位，六歲遜政，未享「九五」之福。亦不曾堂君主之權，寂處深宮，爲太監宮嬪，遺老旗丁所包圍，境况日窘，仍須維持皇帝之排塲，捧塲人雖多，無非都看在宮中那些皇遺財產的分上。「賞賜」，「俸餉」，上下沾潤之外，心有不足，則偸偸換換，明知此小皇威令不行於宮外，奄宦人等，更無忌憚。癸亥之災，據說即因失竊太多，無法掩飾，索興放起一把大火，痛快滅跡。　境之腐敗惡劣，不堪言狀，溥儀一）極無聊之輩的膜拜，年年月月，須出其祖產給養之，傀儡生涯，比「僞滿」之僞皇滋味，無甚差別。然其本人正在靑年，能謂敎胡博士，可見已接近現代思想，若乘此火災，警醒迷夢，擺脫高貴樊籠，改造新的生命，自不失爲一種機會，所謂「塞翁失馬，安知非福』。顧先生的詩意，眞乃冷眼熱腸，爲一孺子」前　設想，至爲深厚。</p>
<p>然而他究竟是一個「孺子」，被架弄的弱者，沒有決斷，沒有自由，到第二年（民國十三年）之冬，馮玉祥倒戈「　曹」（錕）順　加演「逼宮」，把溥儀及舊皇族眷，全盤驅出故宮，由平而津，成爲比較平凡的寓公。有人勸他出洋求學，究全解除舊的束縛，努力作個實際有能的靑年，代表一族，效力中華，又是一個良好機會。</p>
<p>然而一般腐劣的「臣下」，旣不放鬆，日人又來個「草枯鷹眼疾」，看得「奇貨可居」，把他保護到天津日租界，稱爲「行在」，日本官商亦待以君主之禮，遺老們照舊儀注請安上奏，掩耳盜鈴，稱孤道寡。如是者八年之久，把出洋求學新生命的一切機會錯過了。至「九一八」事起，土肥原趕到天津，連哄騙帶威嚇，先搬到大連，後移長春。先敎他做「執政」，後又推他爲「皇帝」，年號則先「大同」，後「康德」，朝三暮四，非驢非馬。且旣不許復稱「大淸」，又不許還其三百年前之舊都（奉天），而指定長春，做了十四年的Puppet，啼笑俱非，任他「牽絲」，爲人「作嫁」，宜乎勝利以後，溥氏被押解到日東京出證日人罪犯時，縷述經過，憤激大呼，至於拍案。蓋當「土匪」（即「土肥」）　走之先，溥氏左右與之接洽，原有相當之條件，「土匪」滿口應承，及至大連，入得勢力範圍，情形異樣。溥已有覺察，遲疑不進，逗一留數月之久，終不勝脅迫，相隨東去。成立偽組織之初，尙略有體面，未幾圖窮匕現，一切由日人掌握，部有日籍「次長」而「總長」伴食，院有日籍「總務應長」而「總理」畫諾。政務如此，溥固不得過問，即「宮」內亦漸被干涉，用人及經費，槪無自由矣。</p>
<p>溥稱「執政」，乃仿民國十四年之老段（祺瑞）。其進稱皇帝，建元「康德」，則影射淸初之「康熙」，乃師法民國五年老袁以「洪憲」影射明初之「洪武」。又前淸及日本是帝之下有「內閣」，而僞「滿」則只能稱「國務總理」。又日本及前淸均有所謂「責任內閣」，君主不負政治責任，而偽「滿」則不但偽皇無權，即偽總理（先鄭孝胥後張景惠）亦擁虛位，而由總務廳之日人指揮一切，是「閣制」之外，創一「廳制」，萬國所無，眞乃笑談。</p>
<p>溥氏做了十四年Puppet之後，最近三年，又做異械之Priuoner。昔之傀儡風光，還算是白山黑水的老家，今之俘虜生活，則流離蘇境，舉目無親，吾人讀歷中宋代微欽被虜於金，拘押五　城之苦况，及金之末路，金主　　被蒙古所逼，出亡　州，進的雙溝寺，蒿艾滿目，其后妃押送和林，史筆大書「在道艱　萬狀，更甚於徽欽之時」，則今溥氏之由長春而海參崴而莫斯科，其狀况可想而知。未亨一日之實權，備嘗亡國君之苦痛，蓋自始即未曾擺脫「奇貨」性質。腐　誤之，日人禍之，二十年巳兩失自由的機會了。亦是他命該如此！</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Passes General Rules and Outline for Rationing in Five Cities; Rationing Can Begin, Requiring 352,000 Tons in April</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The case of rationing grain in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has been discussed by the Ministry of Food, together with the China Relief Mission of the United States, the mayors of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and related agencies. General rules for grain rationing in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou have been drafted. Furthermore, an outline of a plan for rationing grain in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, drafted by the China Relief Mission of the United States, has been amended and approved by the Grain Rationing Conference of the Five Cities and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which approved the full text of the general rules and the plan outline at its 44th meeting on the 24th, as follows:</p>
<p>General Rules for the Rationing of Food for Residents of the Five Cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou</p>
<p>Article 1: The government, in order to ration food for the residents of the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, establishes these general rules.</p>
<p>Article 2: The affairs of rationing food for residents of the five cities shall be the responsibility of the mayors of each city, who shall establish a Food Allocation Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Allocation Committee") to handle them. If a city already has a food allocation organization, it may submit a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to handle food rationing matters without establishing a Food Allocation Committee.</p>
<p>Article 3: The Mayor may concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Food Allocation Committee, and may appoint one or two Deputy Chairmen. The committee members shall include one representative each from the China Relief Mission of the Executive Yuan (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive Yuan Mission"), the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Municipal Council, as well as other necessary personnel appointed and hired. The organization thereof shall be formulated by each city and reported to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Article 4: Each city's Allocation Committee shall, based on accurate household registration, print food purchase certificates in units of household or population, and issue them to residents. Residents shall use the certificates to purchase grain at designated grain distribution points. The printing of food purchase certificates shall be based on the principles of being difficult to forge and easy to carry. Food purchase certificates shall not be transferable.

<h3>Outline of the Grain Rationing Plan</h3>
<p>(1) Preamble: In accordance with items E and F of Article 2 of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, which state, "The Chinese Government will take appropriate steps to ensure that people of all classes receive fair and equal shares in the distribution of American relief materials and similar materials produced locally or imported from abroad" and "In the major cities of China, where circumstances permit, distribution and price control systems should be established to ensure that people of all classes, regardless of their purchasing power, receive fair shares of relief materials imported from abroad or produced locally," our government has decided to match American relief grain with an equal amount of grain, to implement comprehensive rationing in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. The principles and implementation methods are outlined as follows:</p>
<p>(2) Principles: 1. Comprehensive rationing: All citizens with registered residency shall be entitled to purchase rationed grain with certificates. 2. Fixed quantity: Regardless of gender or age, each person shall be rationed one shi dou (calculated as 15 shi jin) of rice or the equivalent in flour (15 shi jin) per month. 3. Fixed price: Slightly lower than market price, set once a month. 4. Fixed term: Provisionally set for four months (starting in March or April, depending on local grain reserves). 5. Grain source: Half from the United States and half from China. The American portion shall be supplied by the China Relief Mission of the Executive Yuan, and the Chinese portion shall be supplied by the Ministry of Food through centralized planning, with the centralized planning method to be determined separately. A total of 88,000 tons is needed per month, and 352,000 tons are needed for four months (the above quantities include the rice needed for Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and the flour needed for Beiping and Tianjin). (Attached table) Nanjing's population is 1.2 million, requiring 1.2 million dou of rice or 15 jin of flour per person per month, totaling 9,600 tons. A total of 38,400 tons is needed for four months. Shanghai's population is 5 million, requiring 5 million dou, totaling 40,000 tons. A total of 160,000 tons is needed for four months. Guangzhou's population is 1.4 million, requiring 1.4 million dou, totaling 11,200 tons. A total of 44,800 tons is needed for four months. Beiping's population is 1.7 million, requiring 25.5 million jin (equivalent to 1.7 million dou of rice), totaling 13,600 tons. A total of 54,400 tons is needed for four months. Tianjin's population is 1.7 million, requiring 25.5 million jin (equivalent to 1.7 million dou of rice), totaling 13,600 tons. A total of 54,400 tons is needed for four months. In total, the population is 11 million, requiring 11 million dou of rice per month, totaling 88,000 tons, with a total need of 352,000 tons.</p>
<p>(3) Organization: This time, in the five cities' implementation of grain rationing, in addition to American relief grain, our government will also raise an equal amount of grain to implement in coordination. In order to adapt to the administrative system and facilitate implementation, the Ministry of Food shall take overall charge. The mayors of each city shall be practically responsible for the rationing work in each city, and shall either use existing organizations (such as the Food Allocation Committee or distribution points, etc.) or form appropriate organizations, under the supervision of the Ministry of Food, to be responsible for implementation. The American Relief Grain Rationing Committee of the United States Relief Mission of the Executive Yuan (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive Yuan Mission"), originally established in each city, shall be responsible for reviewing and supervising the distribution of the American portion of grain in each city.

<h3>The Fuel Control Committee Purchases Foreign Coal</h3>
<p>Requests the Central Bank to Approve an Overdraft of 400 Billion</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] According to the provisions of the five measures for fuel coal supply approved by Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang, 100,000 tons of foreign coal should be purchased and stored in Shanghai for future use. According to current foreign exchange prices, this requires 400 billion yuan in national currency. The Shanghai Fuel Control Committee is unable to pay, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, considering the matter urgent, has telegraphed Central Bank Governor Zhang, requesting approval for an overdraft of 400 billion yuan, using the ordered foreign coal as collateral for the overdraft, so that it can be purchased and stored in a timely manner. Regarding the current coal needs in the Southeast region, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has taken the following measures: (1) Please instruct Director Li and Commander-in-Chief Fu in Beiping to quickly allocate 100,000 tons of Kailuan coal and transport it to Shanghai, and thereafter maintain a quantity of 150,000 tons per month. (2) 3,400 tons of Kailuan coal and 7,100 tons of Mentougou coal, recently transported to the Tanggu New Port awaiting shipment, have been telegraphed to the Shanghai Fuel Control Committee to dispatch ships for transport. (3) A telegram has been sent to the Taiwan Provincial Government, instructing the Taiwan Anthracite Coal Adjustment Committee to allocate 60,000 tons of coal for transport to Shanghai in February for emergency use. (4) The coal used by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should be supplied by the Leping Jiangnan Company Coal Mine. The ministry is currently preparing to build a branch line from Guixi to Leping in order to transport coal. The Ministry has notified the mine to quickly negotiate with the Railway Bureau regarding coal supply and export methods.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Loan Zoning Redetermined</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The issue of the division of agricultural loan areas has changed due to the military impact on the loan areas planned by the Agricultural Bank.

The division of lending areas between the China Farmers Bank and the Cooperative Treasury will be discussed by both parties at a joint small group meeting on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Senator Taft Declares that U.S. Aid to China is Insufficient</h3>
<p>Accuses Marshall of Stubborn Prejudice</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] Senator Taft advocated providing China with strong military assistance to eliminate the Communist rebellion. He also criticized the US government's proposed "Aid to China Plan," saying it was a relief plan that would not solve China's problems. He also criticized the State Department, saying it encouraged the CCP and spread statements against Chairman Chiang. Taft praised Chairman Chiang, saying he was the only person who could prevent the spread of communism in China. However, his troops in the Northeast are currently facing enemies on all four sides and are unable to fight the Communists. The reason is that we have not supplied them with the US weapons and ammunition for months, while the Soviet Union is providing the CCP with as many weapons as possible seized from Japan at the end of the war. Therefore, unless we take strong action immediately, the Northeast of China will fall into the hands of the Communists. Taft also criticized Marshall, saying that he held a completely negative attitude towards his responsibility for the China issue based on his own prejudice.</p>
<h3>The United States' Gold Policy Will Not Change at Present</h3>
<p>Talk by an Economic Expert in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The United Press International, New York, recently reported that the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers is advocating a new price for gold. A reporter specially visited an economic expert in this city, who said: At this moment, it is absolutely impossible for the United States to revise its gold policy. Although gold production in the United States has faced rising labor costs after the war, production has continued to increase. The annual estimate for last year is 80 million US dollars, nearly half of the peak of 210 million in 1940 before the war. The amount of gold flowing in after the war is also large, so it does not need to raise the price of gold to stimulate gold production. The United States does not have to worry about exports during the implementation of the Aid to Europe Plan, and it does not need to depreciate the US dollar by raising the price of gold to make commercial competition. Recently, with France opening a gold market, there has been much speculation about the US gold market. In fact, the world has more than one free gold market in France, and the United States is in a different situation and does not need to follow suit.</p>

Chen said that he had obtained assurances from President Roxas that all Chinese who hold old Philippine residence permits or other documentary evidence sufficient to prove that they resided in the Philippines before 1941 will be allowed to return to the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Gui Yongqing Talks About the Navy: If the US Government Continues to Aid China Technically, We Can Build a Good Foundation Within Five Years</h3>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 24th] Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Navy, told United Press reporters yesterday: Unless our country can defend its coast one day, the US Navy will need to stay one day. The United States has contributed greatly to maintaining the safety of the northern section of China's coastline. Qingdao is the headquarters of the US Pacific Fleet and is very important in terms of Far East military strategy, especially today when Dalian and Lushun have not yet returned to our administration. The Chinese government hopes to station its Northern Fleet in Lushun in the future. Gui said that he was pessimistic about the early reception of the two ports. The Sino-Soviet treaty gave the Soviet Union control of Lushun and various rights in Dalian, which was clumsy. Gui also said that he had proposed using the newly recovered Yantai for summer exercises by the US military, but Mr. Badger has not yet replied. The reporter asked: Will the US military still remain in Qingdao when the Chinese Navy training plan is completed? Gui replied: It depends on the situation in the Northeast, Korea, and Japan. Gui hoped that the peace treaty with Japan would limit the Japanese Navy to be smaller than China in the next few years. China does not want to use prohibition methods to take the lead, but must protect itself before the Chinese Navy grows. China currently has five destroyers and less than 300 small warships of various types, which will be enhanced by cruisers and heavy battleships. This depends on the training plan, which is expected to be completed in three to five years. The navy currently has 40,000 officers and soldiers on ships and on shore. Gui acknowledged that China's naval offensive weapons are almost non-existent. Only two of the destroyer fleet have not been dismantled, and even these cannot be prepared for service in six months. If the US government continues to provide technical assistance to China, it is expected that a good foundation can be built within five years.</p>
<h3>Ramsay Arrives in Qingdao, Badger Takes Over Yesterday</h3>

Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of our Navy, also participated in the ceremony. Another news: Admiral Ramsay, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, and his party arrived in Qingdao by special plane at 4 p.m. today for inspection.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Xinmin in Western Liaoning Begins; The National Army Cooperates with the Air Force to Encirle and Attack the Communist Gangs; The Claim that the Air Force Stopped Flying to Shenyang is Not True</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 24th] The battle of Xinmin has begun, and the Communist gangs continue to increase. There have been fierce battles in Xinmin and the outposts outside the Juliu River. The National Army is encircling and attacking the Communist gangs by land and air. The Communist gangs outside the port of Yingkou did not dare to attack. The Communist gangs near Kaiyuan Station on the northern road attacked the suburbs of Kaiyuan City, 9 kilometers east of the station, on the 23rd, but failed. Also, according to escapees from Anshan, the steel plant has not been damaged, only slightly damaged by artillery fire. No one of the employees who did not escape the factory has been reported injured or killed. In the battle of Anshan, the Communist gangs suffered more than 20,000 casualties.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 23rd] The battle of Western Liaoning will be launched in Dahu Mountain. Elite National Army troops are passing through Jinzhou to the east one after another, and a certain unit from Shanhaiguan is also passing through the pass one after another to take over the defense. The Jinxi garrison of the Jin-Yu section has made contact with the National Army in Xingcheng, Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Related information: Benxi is surrounded on all sides, and the situation is tense. Communist bandit plainclothes teams have been found in Benxi Lake. Guanyuan, more than ten miles to the south, Zhongxintai, ten miles to the east, and Hualiansai, 30 miles to the northwest, have been captured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] The Northeast war situation for a week is as follows: The focus is still on the Southern Liaoning region. The Communist bandits originally planned to besiege Anshan in order to coordinate the harassment in the Shenyang area. The National Army realized their treachery and defended according to the stronghold with a very small number of troops, attracting their main force to a corner of Anshan, cutting it into two sections, and quickly breaking through the bandits in the Shenyang area. Since the 17th, the bandits in various places have been defeated one after another, and the National Army has launched a pursuit. The Communist bandits' self-proclaimed elite Third Column has been fatally hit, and has joined other bandits, fleeing in different directions to the Liao River. In other areas such as northern Liaoning and western Liaoning, there are no bandit activities after the National Army has carried out sweeping operations, which proves that the surrounding situation in Shenyang is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense verified that the news from the Chennault Airlift Task Force that the Chinese Air Force had stopped flying to Shenyang, which was reported by United Press International Qingdao on the 22nd, is not true. Because in fact, Chinese passenger planes are still running, and the air force has not issued such an order.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] According to US Consul General in Shenyang Walter's telegram to the US Embassy in Nanjing, the Chinese Air Force's suspension of flights to Shenyang was due to frozen runways and personnel relations. The situation around Shenyang has seemed calmer in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Kowloon Walled City Case Nears Final Stage of Negotiations, China Proposes New Suggestions Awaiting British Response</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] It is learned that the Sino-British negotiations regarding the Kowloon Walled City incident have reached their final stage. Several methods of utilizing the disputed area were successively proposed and discussed by both sides, but no results were obtained. Our country proposed another suggestion last week. After several discussions between Ambassador Steven and the Foreign Minister, we stated that this was our final suggestion and hoped the British side would give it serious consideration. Otherwise, we would revert to our original demands. The British ambassador agreed to forward the suggestion to London for instructions and provide a response as soon as possible. The capital is currently awaiting a response from London. To ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations, what the reporter can report is that the content of the pending suggestion is to utilize the disputed area to construct an uninhabited public space that can be used for recreation and is conducive to health and hygiene, while incorporating symbols of our country's jurisdiction in the design or management. In fact, the British side no longer denies our country's due jurisdictional rights in the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Chennault on US Aid to China: Military Assistance Is Indispensable, Suggests Using Wartime Sino-American Mixed Regiment Model</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] General Chennault, at the request of reporters yesterday, expressed his views on US military aid to China. Chennault said: "The fact that the US aid to China program does not include a military aid plan has caused disappointment among the Chinese people, and I share that feeling. I do not believe that financial and economic aid alone can save the current serious situation. As for the most effective form of US military aid to China, I believe that when answering this question, there must be a prerequisite, that is, there must first be a sincere understanding between the Chinese and American governments that active military assistance is a necessary measure. I personally believe that this measure is not only necessary, but also indispensable. Before an agreement is reached on this basic principle, it is too early to predict the true content of this measure. However, I personally believe that military aid to China should not only include American advisors and technical assistance, but also some direct guidance that does not conflict with Chinese sovereignty. Such a system of Sino-American cooperation can be exemplified by the Sino-American mixed regiments during the war. However, this type of cooperation should be based on not directly participating in combat." The reporter further asked whether the reports that some American military advisors advocated that the National Army withdraw from the Northeast in order to fully defend North China was a wise strategy. General Chennault replied: "I have not heard that American military advisors advocate withdrawing from the Northeast. However, the situation in that area is rapidly changing and is about to lose the opportunity for free choice. Given China's current military potential, I am very doubtful that North China can maintain a stable situation if the communist troops control the entire Northeast. In terms of international influence, if the Northeast is unfortunately abandoned, I firmly believe that the United States will be greatly shocked and will fully realize that China may lose its position as a barrier to preventing the spread of world communism."</p>

As for Hengshan County, according to a telegram from County Magistrate Liu, Hengshan's winter defense is peaceful and the public order is good. No bandits have been discovered in the county's jurisdiction, so the aforementioned bandits have not infiltrated Hengshan.</p>

When asked when the Chairman would return to Nanjing, they said: It is hoped that he will arrive by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Save Our Northeast Compatriots from the Abyss!</h3>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan and a group of eight other anti-Japanese heroes from the Songhua River, arrived in Shanghai from their hometowns a few days ago. They first told reporters from the Central News Agency that they were summoned to Beijing to provide opinions to the central government on behalf of the people of the Northeast. The day before yesterday afternoon, they again received the press in Shanghai, detailing the crisis in the Northeast and how to save it: and they had already taken a train to Beijing the night before, to make earnest and sincere appeals to the central government, requesting the central government to quickly decide on a grand plan to save the Northeast. In recent days, the war situation in the Northeast has become more serious day by day. Liaoyang and Anshan have fallen one after another, and Benxi has been fiercely attacked by the communist bandits. Shenyang has indeed fallen into a state of siege. The eyes of the people across the country are focused on the Northeast. The Northeast is the treasure house of East Asia and the lifeline of China. Everyone knows the principle that "only with the Northeast can North China be protected: only by protecting North China can Central China be solidified." Therefore, the people of Beijing and Shanghai are eagerly awaiting the arrival of national heroes and Northeast veterans in Beijing, but at the same time, they are filled with bitterness and regret.</p>
<p>According to General Ma Zhanshan's statement to reporters from the Central News Agency, he will present four suggestions to the central government: (1) Establish local armed forces in the Northeast; (2) Reform the currency system in the Northeast; (3) Transport grain to relieve the food shortage among the people in the Northeast; (4) Simplify administrative institutions. When receiving the press in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he added explanations: (1) Since the victory, the city has suffered severe damage, the people's livelihood has been declining, and the administrative structure is complicated, and the military and civilians are disconnected, which has caused the people of the Northeast to fall into a state of helplessness, so they have to shout loudly and demand that the government give them a thorough reform. (2) The food problem in the Northeast is becoming increasingly serious, especially the food shortage in the city of Shenyang is most worrying. In addition, too many circulation vouchers have been issued, resulting in the value of the currency being less than one-tenth of that of the Taiwan dollar. The central government should take emergency measures to transport grain to relieve the food shortage in the Northeast, and reform the currency system in the Northeast to stabilize the people's livelihood. (3) The current situation in the Northeast has reached its most serious stage. The central government should immediately take effective measures to strengthen the military in the Northeast and at least maintain the existing strongholds. (4) The Northeast problem is not only a national problem, but also a world problem. The people of the whole country should face its seriousness squarely. (5) The way to save the Northeast is to first open up the Yushun transportation line, and at the same time, we must strengthen the military strength in North China. (6) The Northeast has abundant manpower and material resources. If they can be used well, they can become a great force for stabilizing China.</p>
<p>When we listened to General Ma Zhanshan's words, it was as if we heard the faint voices of millions of compatriots in the Northeast. Especially when General Ma said, "The youth of the Northeast have experienced many rebellions and are mostly enthusiastic patriots. Their concept of defending their hometowns is the strongest. If the central government can have appropriate measures, I believe that they will definitely be able to take on the responsibility of defending the country," it moved us the most. However, we must reflect and ask ourselves: Since the victory, what policies have those who have held important military, political, and economic responsibilities in the Northeast grasped? What forces have they used? Have they truly loved the local area? Have they truly been able to cooperate with the people? These great men, initially dazzled by victory, were vying to become the receiving officials of the Northeast. General discussions called for the hearts of the people of the Northeast to be received, but it did not wake them up. Otherwise, we believe that no matter how bad the objective conditions in the Northeast are, the situation in the Northeast would not have deteriorated to such an extent! Of course, the communist bandits, with the support of foreign races, are deliberately trying to seize the Northeast. However, the civil and military officials who have been responsible for the Northeast's military and political affairs should have taken it as a warning to be shamed by failing to fulfill the orders of the supreme commander, and they should have been conscientious and industrious, and they would not have failed the people of the Northeast and the whole country. Now, in this time of crisis, we have to trouble these veterans of the Northeast to go south and appeal, how ashamed should we be, how should we repent?</p>
<p>The communist bandits' ambition to seize the entire Northeast by force was revealed as early as the beginning of the Japanese surrender. On the one hand, the communist bandits prevented the National Army from going to the Northeast to receive sovereignty. On the other hand, they organized the so-called "Democratic Allied Army" to attack the areas that the National Army had already received. The weapons they used were mostly military equipment that the Soviet army had seized when the enemy surrendered, so their strength was quite strong, and it had long been noticed by Chinese and foreign people. In the spring of last year, the communist bandits shouted the slogan "Ensure the Northeast, consolidate North China, and develop Central China," which further showed that the communist bandits' attempt to seize the Northeast was not only their consistent policy of making trouble and rebellion, but also something they were bound to fight for at any cost. For the sake of the future security of the country and the nation, we must resolutely prevent the development of the communist bandits in the Northeast. The starting point should be to trust the people of the Northeast with lofty ideals and to start training local armed forces in the Northeast. Unfortunately, although the whole country, both the government and the public, raised their vigilance at the beginning of the Northeast rebellion, they were unable to decide on appropriate policies to curb the rebellion before the communist bandits grew in power. If the civil and military officials responsible for the Northeast's military, political, and economic affairs could have discerned the environment, known themselves and their enemies, based on the original intention of loving the people and loving the local area, and never had any prejudices or biases, then the compatriots in the Northeast, who had been under the oppressive rule of the Japanese for a long time, would have been able to be inspired and jump for joy. Under the leadership of the central government, they would have done their best to ensure their hometowns. Therefore, the Northeast compatriots' inability to get rid of the abyss early on was half due to the communist bandits and half due to this group of officials who harmed the country!</p>
<p>Although, "what is past cannot be remedied, what is to come can still be pursued." The central government should, in fact, thoroughly reform the political, economic, and military aspects of the Northeast today. "It is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost." The opinions put forward by the Northeast veterans at present are commonplace, but it is important to make decisive decisions and implement them quickly. The 450 million people of the whole country are willing to be the backing for saving the Northeast compatriots. As long as the leadership is appropriate, and as long as the public is united, there is still hope for reversing and consolidating the situation in the Northeast. Here, we would like to offer our views briefly:</p>
<p>First, the unfortunate Northeast has suffered rebellions for nearly ten years. The Northeast compatriots have been separated from the motherland for a long time, and they are not unfamiliar with the political situation in the motherland, but their expectation of throwing themselves into the arms of the motherland contains a strong centripetal force. General Ma and others, with their qualifications as anti-Japanese heroes in the past, will be able to return to the Northeast, climb to a high place and give a call to defend their hometowns. They should be able to gain the resonance of the Northeast compatriots, and it will be easier to accomplish their mission of saving the Northeast. However, General Ma and others have also been separated from the Northeast for nearly ten years, and they may not be able to fully understand the feelings and wishes of the Northeast people today. They should make every effort to communicate their feelings and exchange views, so that they can respond to each other and become one, fill the distance between them, and then they can exert their strength.</p>
<p>Second, in times of crisis in the Northeast, it is most appropriate for Northeast veterans to return to their hometowns. However, at the same time, we earnestly hope that these veterans, on the one hand, will grow stronger with age, and on the other hand, will promote talents, so that the people of the Northeast with lofty ideals, regardless of new or old, young or old, will work together to save the local area and save the people, then they can take on the mission of the current era.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that the central government will never easily give up the Northeast. Although the situation in the Northeast is serious, there are still ways to think about it and there is still manpower to use. We hope that the officials in the central government will quickly broaden their horizons, expand their minds, concentrate their will, and unite their strength to save the Northeast compatriots from the abyss—</p>

<h3>China's Tung Oil Sales to the US Are Preventing Smuggling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs: China's tung oil sales to the US are roughly divided into two types: exports from Shanghai and exports from Hong Kong. Due to exchange rate issues, the amount of national currency obtained from the exchange of Shanghai exports based on the selling price is always insufficient to cover the cost by about 5%. On the Hong Kong side, due to the smuggling of tung oil from various ports in South China to Hong Kong, no exchange rate is required, so its selling price is often lower than that in Shanghai. The Chinese government is constantly trying to prevent the smuggling of tung oil to Hong Kong for sale in order to prevent lowering the selling price of tung oil. Some American tung oil producers may not be aware of the smuggling situation and may mistakenly believe that it is dumping. Once this smuggling situation ends, there will naturally be no external sales of low-priced tung oil.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Reporter Group Flies to Taiyuan Today to Investigate the Economy</h3>

Yan Xishan, Chairman of Jin Province, has been holding on to the critical situation for more than two years.

Their children shall also be considered as having the nationality of the Republic of China in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the same law. If the Japanese man is unwilling to acquire Chinese nationality, he shall be repatriated to Japan immediately, and his children shall follow the nationality of their mother. Article 2: Japanese women who have become concubines of Taiwanese men, or who have cohabited with Taiwanese men for many years with the intention of permanent cohabitation, and the man's wife has already died, or the Taiwanese man has never married, shall immediately complete the marriage ceremony and then apply for acquiring Chinese nationality in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Nationality Law.

<h3>Last Year, 935 Foreigners Acquired Chinese Nationality</h3>
<p>Most of them are Japanese Women</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] After the National Government promulgated the Chinese Nationality Law in the 18th year of the Republic of China, it stipulated that foreigners who are wives of Chinese citizens, or whose fathers are Chinese citizens, or whose fathers are untraceable but whose mothers are Chinese citizens, and those who are adopted sons of Chinese citizens, can acquire the nationality of the Republic of China. Furthermore, foreigners who are over 20 years old, of good character, have resided in China for more than five consecutive years, and possess considerable property or skills sufficient for self-reliance, may also acquire Chinese nationality through naturalization. According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, from the 26th to the 36th year of the Republic of China, a total of 1,257 people acquired our nationality, of which 1,249 were women and only 8 were men. Japanese nationality accounted for 660 people, Russian nationality 227 people, and German nationality 150 people. A total of 417 people acquired nationality through naturalization. The reason for acquiring nationality is that 95% are wives of Chinese citizens, among which Japanese women are the most. Taking the 36th year alone, among the 935 people who acquired our nationality, 647 were of Japanese nationality, and almost all were wives of Chinese citizens.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Rice Prices Surge Again, Disturbances in the Cotton Cloth Market are Severe, and Price Increases in Wuxi are Intensifying</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 24th] Rice prices here suddenly surged again today. Outside the white rice market, transactions were at 2.35 million yuan per dan. Because people are optimistic about further price increases, some rice shops are selling at black market prices as high as 2.7 million yuan, which is causing significant public anxiety. The weather cleared up yesterday and today, and goods from the countryside have been arriving steadily. This price surge is unexpected. It is said that the reasons are: first, the prices of all goods are rising, and rice is following suit; second, it is rumored that the Wuxi County government has abandoned the price restriction system, allowing grain merchants to freely set prices. Rice merchants here have long felt aggrieved by the government's price restrictions and are also brewing demands for the county government to abolish the price restrictions. This has caused the restricted price to become detached from the actual market price. All sectors of society are deeply concerned that with rice prices soaring so high, various problems will follow.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 24th] Today, the price increases here are intensifying. Due to purchases from the northern region, rice prices have risen by more than 100,000 yuan. White glutinous rice is at 2,554,000, white round rice at 2,484,000, glutinous paddy at 1,120,000, round paddy at 1,165,000, Xiangshan glutinous paddy at 1,032,000, and port paddy at 1,022,000, each rising by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Wheat is at 3,350,000 to 3,380,000, jumping by more than 200,000 yuan. Flour is at 1,240,000, rising by 40,000 yuan. Soybean oil is at 5,700,000, continuing to rise by more than 200,000 yuan. Double Fish yarn is at 64,400,000, soaring by more than 4,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch, 24th] Yarn prices continue to rise after rice prices. Today, the market price in this city reached 62.5 million yuan, and most yarn merchants are still unwilling to sell. The unofficial rice price has reached 2.67 million yuan. Five Oceans (a brand of edible oil) continues to rise, with oil at 9.6 million yuan per barrel. Cigarettes are stable. Soap is also rising, with Sunlight soap at 3.2 million yuan per case. Flour prices are rising alarmingly, at 990,000 yuan per bag, which is 50% higher than at the end of last year.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] Prices in Zhenjiang are chaotic, changing from morning to evening. The County Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting today and unanimously believed that slight adjustments would help the price increases. It has now been decided that all proposals will be reserved, and after the Provincial Government Economic Council decides on the pricing principles, the meeting will reconvene on Friday of this week.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Prices in Jinan City are generally soaring. Among them, the most volatile are cotton yarns and cloths. On the 23rd, prices rose by nearly 2,000 yuan in a single day. The highest price for 20-count local spider yarn reached 77 million yuan per piece, which is even higher than the price in Qingdao and Shanghai. Although prices stabilized somewhat on the 24th, observers generally believe that some people are manipulating the market and hoarding goods for speculation. In addition, the black market price of gold suddenly rose to nearly 20 million yuan on the 23rd, but fell to 18.5 million yuan per tael on the 24th.</p>

<h3>Central Government Determines Subsidy Amount for Zhejiang Province's First Half-Year Budget</h3>

The shortfall will be supplemented from the provincial shell overage. As for the salaries of public education employees, the central government has agreed to subsidize 90%, so it is necessary to reduce the number of staff by 10%, and teachers and technicians by 3%. This will be implemented starting in March, with each receiving three months of severance pay. The provincial government will bear a total of more than 20 billion yuan. In addition, Zhejiang Province's security teams currently have seven general teams, equivalent to about five regiments. In view of the seriousness of the security situation, and in order to eliminate hidden bandits, the provincial government has decided to increase and reorganize them into eight regiments.</p>

<h3>Beiping Cracks Communist Bandit Organization, 103 People Arrested, Joint Declaration of Self-Renewal, Security Authorities Release Details of the Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] The Beiping Committee of the Communist Bandit City Work Department was cracked by the local security organs at the end of the 36th year. The bandit municipal committee Bao Ke and 103 others were arrested. After being persuaded with righteousness, they all knew to repent, were willing to break away from the Communist bandits, participate in the National Revolution, and engage in the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. They jointly issued a declaration a few days ago, stating their aspiration to abandon banditry and start anew. The security authorities released the details of the case, stating:</p>
<p>Grasping the Treacherous Plans</p>
<p>The Communist bandits launched a rebellion, destroying cities and towns, and disrupting the lives of our rear area people. They had long been plotting this. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they organized the "City Work Department" and dispatched a large number of workers to sneak into major cities to carry out activities. After the victory, their activities became even greater. Beiping is the military and political center of North China, and their deliberate sabotage was particularly unreserved. The city's security organs understood the Communist bandits' treacherous plans and mobilized capable cadres to spread a reconnaissance network. They had long learned that the person directing underground activities in this city was the City Work Department led by Liu Ren of the Communist Bandit Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau. There were no clues at first, but there was some understanding over the years. In order to completely destroy its organization, they did not immediately crack the case, but after more than a year of close surveillance, tracking, and investigation, they learned about the organizational system of its City Work Department. Its main work departments were the Industrial Committee, the Railway Committee, the Beiping Committee, and the Student Committee. The Beiping Committee and the Student Committee were its backbone. They also learned that the main person in charge of the Beiping Committee in this city was Bao Ke of the Municipal Committee, who used a certain inn outside Zhengyangmen as the main base and met with district committee members Zhang Yingmin and others from time to time.</p>
<p>Starting the Action</p>
<p>After multiple days of waiting and investigation, and confirming that there were no errors, they began to take action at the end of last year. They arrested district committee member Zhang Yingmin and cadres Wang Chengwang, Qi Tianqing, Zhang Yuehua (female), Wu Xiaobo, and others on the spot. However, Bao Ke's whereabouts were secretive, and his address was uncertain. After Zhang and others were arrested, they investigated for another three days, and the bandit Bao finally fell into the net. Subsequently, according to the clues provided by Bao and others, they continued to arrest bandit district committee members Yang Ying, Liu Zhenzhong, Wang Hongru, Zhang Haiquan, branch secretaries Ma Hongjie, Guo Chunlin, traffic officers Liu Guirong, Gao Xiaocai, liaison officers Zhang Yansheng, Shan Xiuwen, Ma Baolin, Zhang Jianheng, informant Li Zhenzhou, and party members Han Jiuru and others, totaling 103 people.</p>
<p>Confiscated Documents</p>
<p>They cracked 37 branches and 68 groups, and confiscated 30 copies of Communist bandit propaganda documents, a secret statistical material of the Beiping Underground Work of the City Work Department, a note from district committee member Yang Ying recalling them to the organ, a report from Bao Ke and Zhao Fan to Liu Ren, head of the City Work Department, a notice from Liu Ren, head of the City Work Department, recalling district committee member Yang Ying, and various secret codes of the Communist bandits and several secret reports.</p>
<p>Conspiracy Activities</p>
<p>It was found that Bao Ke (alias Liu Jianye, Chen Changqing, Gong Wengyao) was led by Liu Ren, head of the Communist Bandit City Work Department, and was connected by Li Xingji. He directed the district committees in this city to carry out the following conspiracy activities: (1) Absorb party members and develop the organization. (2) Engage in anti-government and anti-allied propaganda. (3) Detect government and national army intelligence. (4) Incite strikes, class boycotts, teaching boycotts, grain grabbing, and stir up worker and student movements to disrupt social order. (5) Prepare secret armed forces so that when the Communist bandits invade this city, they can rise up as internal collaborators. (6) Disrupt the government's political, financial, economic, cultural, and military measures. (7) Incite kind workers and farmers, organize young students, lower and middle-level civil servants, and frustrated elements to go to the Communist bandit area to receive red training. (8) Sabotage tap water, electric lights, transportation agencies, and factory production sites. (9) Carry out red propaganda, spread rumors, and confuse people's minds.</p>

<h3>US Representative Urges Small Assembly to Handle National Elections in Korea, Election Monitoring Committee Need Not Consider Soviet Obstruction, Korean Representative to China Urges UN to Establish South Korean Government Quickly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 24th] The United Nations Small Assembly began debating the issue of Korean independence today. US Representative Jessup urged the Assembly to ignore Soviet obstruction and proceed with holding national elections in Korea. It is said that it is the duty of the United Nations Korean Election Monitoring Committee to work quickly so that the Korean people can elect a parliament. The United Nations organization must not allow the Soviet Union's policy of non-cooperation to obstruct the construction of a free and independent Korea. It is hoped that the Soviet Union will change its mind and allow the committee to hold elections in the Soviet-occupied areas in accordance with the instructions of the Small Assembly.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Success Lake, 24th] On the 24th, the United States requested that the United Nations Small Assembly order some local elections to be held in South Korea. The elections, under the supervision of the United Nations, will elect two-thirds of the representatives of the "Korean National Assembly," which is a step towards an independent national government. US Representative Jessup said that the population of North Korea accounts for about one-third of the country's total population, so one-third of the seats in the National Assembly should be left vacant. He reiterated the United States' desire to enable the Korean people to quickly obtain self-governance and independence. He said: "Due to the lack of manpower of the committee, it is not possible to hold elections in all areas at the same time, so it may be possible to hold elections from south to north, area by area. We hope that this kind of election can be extended to the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea, otherwise two-thirds of the representatives of the National Assembly can be elected, and the remaining one-third of the people will be deprived of the right to elect representatives to participate in the National Assembly. The world should know who deprives them of this right, but the Korean National Assembly can be established. If it is willing, it can discuss the establishment of a national government with the Korean Committee. We hope that the people of North Korea can participate in the national government at this time." Jessup said when submitting the Gen. Country's plan to the Small Assembly: "At present, Gen. People are still unwilling to speculate that the Soviet Union will support the wishes of the United Nations and the hopes of the Korean people. Why can't one-third of the Korean people participate in the election? If there should be an election, why doesn't the Korean Committee implement it?"</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Korean Mission to China, the China General Branch of the Korean Independence Party, and Korean residents' associations in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Bian, Xu, Sui, Taiwan, and other places, sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 23rd, petitioning the UN: "We hope that the decision will be made before March 1st to announce the holding of general elections in South Korea, establish an independent government, and hope that in order to realize free elections, the police rule in South Korea will be terminated as soon as possible." Min Seok-rin, a spokesman for the Korean Mission to China, also said: The on-site observation of the United Nations Korean Committee will definitely help them make a wise decision on this matter.</p>
<h3>Three Powers Agree on the German Question, Eastern Repatriation, Benelux Countries to Participate, First Discuss Germany's Position in the European Aid Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] The United States, Britain, and France formally held a secret meeting on Germany today and agreed to give priority to discussing Germany's position in the Marshall Plan. At the start of the talks, the British Foreign Office published its note rejecting the Soviet Union's protest against the meeting. The note stated that Britain had decided to reopen negotiations on all points on which the four powers disagreed, in order to avoid "peaceful reconstruction of Germany and Europe being hampered." The three powers also invited the Benelux countries to participate in discussions on issues related to those three countries. The three powers have agreed that economic issues will be the top priority of the agenda. At the same time, the three powers' experts on the German question will determine the final figures for Germany's share in the Marshall Plan. All parties participating in the meeting expect that this statistic will occupy a military position in the Six-Nation Conference to be convened at the end of March. Clear signs indicate that the three powers and the Benelux countries will use this meeting to discuss the division of Germany into East and West and exchange views on how to draft another policy for the future, such as Germany being divided into a permanent division.</p>
<h3>Six Items on the Agenda</h3>
<p>The other items to be discussed at the meeting are as follows: (1) The role of West Germany in the Marshall Plan. (2) Control of the Rhineland. (3) Security measures to prevent possible German aggression. (4) Reparations. (5) German political and civil groups. The merger of the three zones of West Germany into an economic system will be based on this. (6) Temporary territorial agreement. This issue will include the territorial demands of Germany's western neighbors on Germany. One US diplomat said, "If we cannot reach an agreement on detailed methods, we hope to reach an agreement in principle. We would like this discussion to be of an informal nature, so it is the first opportunity for several countries to frankly express their opinions and exchange views."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] At the beginning of the meeting of the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France, the three countries of Czechoslovakia and Poland had submitted protests to the three powers meeting. According to a Paris telegram, diplomatic circles there expect that if the London meeting can produce a firm and consistent policy, Molotov may change his current policy towards Germany. Recently, the Soviet Union's policy in Germany has been quite hesitant, and the Soviet Union seems to have the intention of keeping the foreign ministers' conference mechanism active. The motive is that the Soviet Union still intends to retain the right to speak on the development of West Germany. Diplomatic reports from the Allied Control Authority in Berlin show that the firmness and achievements of the Western three powers are the key to restoring the Soviet Union's participation in four-power cooperation. General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the US Army, and his political advisor Flying, both have this opinion.</p>
<h3>Italy Joins United Nations Organization</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 21st] Italy has formally joined the United Nations as the 41st member state.</p>
<h3>Five Western European Countries Discuss Establishing Alliance</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministers Meeting to be Held Soon</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain and France have agreed in principle that the foreign ministers of the two countries will meet with the foreign ministers of the Benelux countries in the near future to discuss the proposal for Western European unity. However, the British Foreign Office spokesman said that London believes that this five-nation foreign ministers meeting must be carefully prepared, and so far there has been no definite deployment of the meeting. The date of the meeting does not necessarily have to be decided after the British, American, and French three-power German question meeting is concluded, because the two meetings have no necessary connection. According to well-informed sources, the meeting of the five foreign ministers may be held in Belgium. The form of the alliance treaty proposed by the British and French in the memorandum to the Benelux countries is still under study. The Benelux countries are also still studying the draft alliance treaty proposed by Britain and France, and neither side has yet put forward a final opinion.</p>

<h3>Berlin and Paris Widely Report US-Soviet Secret Talks, Saying a Stalin-Truman Meeting is Impossible</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Despite denials from both the US and the Soviet Union, it is still widely rumored here that Murphy, the political advisor to US military commander Clay, and a senior political figure from the Soviet military government held an informal secret meeting in a neutral location earlier this month. One account claims the Soviet representative was Colonel Siminov, the chief advisor to Soviet military commander Sokolovsky.  According to the London correspondent of the Paris newspaper "Le Figaro" today, the Soviet representative was General Marinin, Sokolovsky's political advisor.  However, General Marinin often uses the name Georgiev when contacting German political circles. According to a report in "Le Figaro," Marinin suggested to Murphy during the meeting why not have Stalin and Truman meet. He said that Truman would not want to go to Moscow, and Stalin would not want to go to Washington, so why not meet in Stockholm? After a moment of thought, Murphy said that due to repeated attacks on the US President by the Soviet press, this was almost impossible. Marinin reportedly said that once Wallace was elected president, the Soviet press would no longer attack. Murphy reportedly said Wallace would not be elected president. Marinin replied that perhaps not this year, but definitely in four years.  The editor of "Le Figaro" added a note after the report, saying that although the report might seem strange, the newspaper was not afraid of denial.</p>

<p>Hoover Discusses Future Wars</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] Former US President Hoover declared tonight at a Washington's Birthday commemorative banquet that if the United States were attacked, Britain and Western Europe might remain neutral. This is not to accuse them of bad faith or ingratitude for the countless resources and blood that the US expended in liberating Europe, but rather due to the weakness of European nations in the face of the clear fact of the two and a half million Red Army soldiers along the Iron Curtain. We should understand that if someone declares war on the US, we will have no reliable military allies in the world. However, he firmly believed that a Western European federation could enhance peace and defense.</p>

<h3>Fisheries Committee Denies Soviet, Japanese, and Korean Exclusion; Agricultural Association Denies Report; World Rice Conference Scheduled for Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press, Iwao, 24th] Authorities at the Far East Food Conference today denied a report in a Manila newspaper that the Soviet Union, Japan, and Korea would be excluded from the International Fisheries Council. Dr. Fee, the Canadian fisheries advisor to the conference, said: "The above report is inaccurate. The issue of which countries should be members of the proposed Fisheries Council has never been discussed at the conference. The Soviet Union is currently participating in the Far East Food Conference and therefore cannot become a member. However, the Soviet Union is free to participate in the Far East Food Conference at any time. Japan and Korea will receive the same treatment if they are recognized as independent nations." He also said that the report stating that the Fisheries Council has eleven member states is also inaccurate, and the number of member states has not been decided at the conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Baguio, 24th] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization conference entered its second day today.

<h3>Taft Supports Principles of European Recovery Aid</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Detroit, 23rd] Senator Taft, a possible Republican presidential candidate, gave a speech here criticizing the concessions made to the Soviet Union during the war and the US failure to obtain guarantees from the Soviet Union in exchange for Lend-Lease aid. He said, "We have completely torn up the Atlantic Charter and abandoned all the principles for which the war was fought. We have never mentioned the freedom of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, nor have we effectively defended Poland's freedom." Taft outlined the policies he would implement if elected president. He said that most of the current difficulties were caused by the Roosevelt administration. The policy of unconditional surrender destroyed Germany, creating a vacuum in Europe, and allowing the Soviet Union to take advantage of it. As for Truman's foreign policy, fortunately, Republican Senator Vandenberg's influence at various international conferences finally forced the Truman administration to abandon its appeasement policy towards Russia. Taft expressed support for the principles of the Marshall Plan, but believed that the complete recovery of European countries depended 90% on their own efforts.</p>
<h3>The Singing Cowboy Wants to be Vice President</h3>
<p>Wallace Aide Willing to Join the Race</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Idaho Democratic Senator Taylor announced today that he will run for vice president with Wallace in the November presidential election. Wallace has personally asked him to participate in the vice-presidential race. Taylor said he would join Wallace in a brave and glorious struggle for peace. Taylor, 44, is a former stage actor. When he brought his family of five to Washington, he could not find a house, so he climbed the marble steps of the Capitol, strummed a guitar, and sang in the tones of a Western cowboy, "Give me a house beside the Capitol." Therefore, people often call him the Singing Cowboy. When a special session of Congress was convened last November to discuss foreign aid, Taylor rode a horse from California to the East, criticizing the government's foreign policy everywhere.</p>

<h3>Hull's Memoirs (13)</h3>
<p>— Copyrighted by North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by the Newspaper Translation Office</p>
<p>First Time Flying at the Age of 72</p>
<p>Around the time of the Quebec Conference (August 1943), a Soviet newspaper suddenly put forward the idea that although a meeting of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union was impossible because Stalin was focused on directing the large-scale war against Germany in the East, a meeting of foreign ministers could be held and could be effective.</p>
<p>The President and Churchill immediately began to study this proposal, and asked Stalin whether he also thought it appropriate to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in the near future. Stalin replied to them both on August 24, saying that he approved. He also said that the meeting should not be of a narrow, exploratory nature, but should be practical preparation, so that the three governments could reach definite decisions. He suggested that the scope of the issues to be discussed should be decided in advance.</p>
<p>After exchanging views, the President and Churchill sent another telegram to Stalin on September 6, in which he said that Churchill and he were deeply pleased with the idea of ​​holding a political and military conference at the level of foreign ministers. Although the Prime Minister suggested London or other cities in Britain as the venue for the meeting, the President said that he thought a more remote place would be better. He suggested Casablanca, Tunisia, or even Sicily. He said that he hoped to send me to the meeting, but he did not want me to travel so far, so he would send Under Secretary of State Welles. Two days later, Stalin suggested Moscow as the venue for the meeting, with the date being early October, and the President agreed on September 11.</p>
<p>At that time, Welles was still in Burma, and according to reliable information I received, he was writing many letters to friends in Washington, saying that he had become a victim of mistreatment.</p>
<p>After a considerable number of this type of fact had accumulated, I went to see the President. I reminded him that he and I had agreed to send Welles to Moscow as the best way to get him out of the State Department without arousing public sentiment. Welles did not think it appropriate to participate in our plan, and went to Burma, and was writing letters to many people there, apparently trying to portray himself as a martyr. I also mentioned to the President what Welles had said when I proposed to send him to Moscow, that such a trip would not be fruitful. I said that I now opposed the State Department recognizing his position, unless he retracted the severe criticism for which he should be responsible, and declared his loyalty to the State Department and the government. Welles did none of these things, and continued to make general criticisms of me and the State Department in a remote place. When one or two newspapers closely related to Welles continued this propaganda, claiming that I was an enemy of the Soviet Union and hoped it would bleed to death, I went to the President and said that I strongly opposed Welles going to Moscow.</p>
<p>I told the President that no matter where the meeting was held—anywhere between here and Chongqing—I would go there myself.</p>
<p>The President immediately expressed satisfaction with my willingness to go myself, and said it forcefully two or three times. At the same time, he was also quite surprised. He knew that I was not in good health, that I was no longer young—I was approaching the eve of my seventy-second birthday—and that I had never been in an airplane.</p>
<p>He did not know another fact—that I suffered somewhat from a disease, which was a fear of being in small, stuffy places. Several years ago, on a very hot night, when I was riding in a sleeping car with the window open through a long tunnel, I woke up and found myself apparently suffocating from carbon gas or other gases. Since then, I have been afraid of narrow, confined places. I had this feeling about airplanes, so I had never taken one before.</p>
<p>But I have now decided to fly to the diplomatic appointment in Moscow, just as an officer must take his troops into battle, whether he wants to or not. I made this decision myself without consulting my doctor or Mrs. Hull. Before I set off for Moscow, I held meetings with the President on October 4 and 5, and had lunch with him on the 6th, to review the various plans that would generally be raised in Moscow. On the 5th, I took Stettinius, Hackworth, Dunn, Matthews, and Bohlen to the White House for a clear discussion with the President, at which Admiral Leahy also attended.</p>
<p>We agreed that in this meeting we should make every effort to obtain British and Soviet agreement to China's participation in a Four-Power Declaration (this is a declaration on various post-war agreements, including the establishment of an international peace organization. The Soviet Union had opposed including China—Editor, News Service). We believed that the concept of the Four Powers should be maintained, even if it meant that an agreement could not be reached at that time. Whether now or in the future, because of its influence on itself and on British India, China is too important a factor to be alienated.</p>
<p>As for Germany, the President said that he thoroughly agreed to divide the country into three or more states, each with its own autonomy, but connected by a postal, transportation, railway, customs, or electricity network, although he believed that the layout of the electricity system should be based on the continent. He also said that the new German states should be deprived of all military activities, including training and arms industries. East Prussia should be separated from Germany, and all dangerous elements among the population should be forcibly evicted.</p>
<p>Others among us argued that partition would produce many adverse effects, and that the customs union approach might either prove unworkable or become a powerful tool for restoring German unity. The President took this into consideration. He said that we had a tendency to exaggerate these effects. He said that he had traveled in Germany, could speak German, and thought he knew Germany better. He insisted that partition was the solution. The conversation moved on to other topics, but after a considerable time, the President suddenly returned to the German issue, saying that his knowledge of Germany was many years ago, and perhaps he did not know Germany as much as he thought he did. So he said that the entire transitional period would be a period of trial and error. We might find that the partition measures implemented immediately after the war would eventually be abandoned. He believed that reparations should be extracted from manpower and equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt said that the recovery of the Netherlands or the Scandinavian countries would not be a problem, but Belgium might cause difficulties. He said that King Leopold was a German prisoner, with an ambiguous position. Britain was supporting him because Churchill believed that the royal family could be restored, but he might cause difficulties for the Belgian government in exile. Apart from this, Belgium was an artificial country formed by the merger of two states, and the Walloons and Flemings had traditionally been at odds. On this point, the President referred to a study made by a German in 1940, which suggested that a federation should be organized from Alsace, Lorraine, Luxembourg, and the two parts of Belgium. As for Poland and the Baltic countries, the President said that when he met Stalin, he wanted to appeal to him with noble moral force. He would say to him that Britain and we would not attack the Soviet Union in the Baltic, but for the Soviet Union's own interests, given its position in the world, it would be good for it to say that it would be willing to hold a second plebiscite in the Baltic countries about two years after the war. He believed that although the Soviet Union thought that the plebiscite it held there was conclusive and satisfactory, the rest of the world did not seem to think so. He believed that the same idea could be applied to eastern Poland, but that country's new borders should be slightly east of the so-called Curzon Line in the future, giving Lviv to Poland, and a plebiscite should be held after the shocks of the war had subsided.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt felt that the Baltic Corridor—Kiel and the Straits—could have a free zone established, under international management, and a similar zone could be established for the Soviet Union in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>At noon on October 7, on a sunny day, I went to Washington Airport to take a plane to Moscow—this was the first time I had ever stepped on a plane.</p>
<p>This was a four-engine transport plane, followed by two similar planes, most of which were Army and Navy personnel.</p>
<p>After I got on the plane, Commander Meyer showed me several emergency exits, ready to be used when the plane "touched" the water. He was sent by the Navy to manage the oxygen on the plane. I said that the fact that there were several exits on the plane reminded me of the story of an old man in Tennessee who kept three cats. One day, a friend went to visit him and found three semicircular holes under the front door.</p>
<p>He asked, "What are these for—?"</p>
<p>The reply was "To let my cats out."</p>
<p>"But why isn't one enough for them?"</p>
<p>The old man retorted forcefully,</p>
<p>"Because when I say 'Out together,' I really want them to go 'Out together'!"</p>
<p>Our first step was to Goose Bay. Over Georgia, the plane had to fly to an altitude of 10,000 feet, and at 8,000 feet I was fitted with an oxygen mask and hood. Old people's reaction to high-altitude flight is not good, and it can easily cause a heart attack, but I did not feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The next morning, our second step took us to San Juan, Puerto Rico. We took the cruiser "Peacock" across the Atlantic to North Africa.</p>
<p>We landed in Casablanca. Our foreign service official flew to meet me. He was in charge of political affairs in North Africa. I was immediately taken to the airport. The plane had flown across the Atlantic at the same time, so we got back on the plane.</p>
<p>Murphy accompanied us on this flight to Algiers, and gave me a general account of his general impression of the situation in North Africa and Italy. In Algiers, I had dinner with Eisenhower. He had come specially from Italy, and I was deeply impressed by his personality and confidence. De Gaulle also came to visit me. We had a long and fairly frank conversation, without reaching any decisions. De Gaulle was more friendly than I had imagined, but his great political ambition seemed to me to be on the verge of bursting out. We flew from Algiers to Cairo at night. I slept quite well. The next morning, I set off for Tehran, Iran.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Eden telegraphed me, suggesting that he and I should hold a preliminary meeting in Cairo before going to Moscow. I replied that our Soviet friends were generally quite suspicious, and would think that Britain and the United States were forming a common policy before starting discussions with the Soviet Union. But when I arrived in Tehran, Eden arrived at about the same time, according to his own timetable. We exchanged greetings and had a few casual words, without entering into any real discussion.</p>
<p>In Tehran, two Soviet pilots boarded the plane. Our new ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, also joined us and stayed with us all the way.</p>
<p>We arrived in Moscow on a cold afternoon on October 18, as the sun was setting. Molotov and Litvinov, as well as our wartime production chief Nelson and a large number of other officials, welcomed us at the airport. Molotov and Litvinov greeted me warmly. I was then driven to the American Embassy.</p>
<h3>Ashida Hitoshi Visits MacArthur Headquarters, Believes Ashida's Election Method is Democratic, New Cabinet's Policy Outline Consultation Work Begins</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Incoming new Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida visited General MacArthur's headquarters at 11:30 AM on the 24th to inform MacArthur that he had been elected as the fifth Prime Minister of post-war Japan. It is believed that Ashida explained his "middle-of-the-road" government plan and requested the Allied authorities to continue assisting with the import of necessary food, capital, and raw materials for economic recovery.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] A spokesperson for MacArthur's headquarters, Mr. Spurr, today refuted the insulting propaganda in Tokyo newspapers regarding the new government, praising the election method of the new Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida as completely democratic and in compliance with the special provisions of the current constitution. This statement was issued in response to the media's belief that the constitution's provision that the position of Prime Minister should automatically be transferred to the leader of the opposition party upon resignation has given Hitoshi Ashida an indirect support in the eyes of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The work of forming the new Ashida cabinet officially began on the 24th. The new Prime Minister Ashida first met with Democratic Party leaders such as Tomabechi and Kurisu in the morning to discuss policy agreements. In the afternoon, he met with Katayama, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, at the Prime Minister's official residence to discuss the policy outline. Subsequently, he visited Miki, Chairman of the National Cooperative Party, and also discussed the policy outline. Afterward, the new Prime Minister Ashida told reporters: "It has been decided that three members from each party, including the Socialist, National Cooperative, and Democratic parties, will first discuss the policy outline. If a policy agreement cannot be reached, then because the Democratic Party cannot form a cabinet alone, other methods will be considered." In addition, Ashida will visit Liberal Party President Yoshida on the 25th to ask for his cooperation and assistance.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Municipal Assembly, Mayor Wu Answers Inquiries: Elections Are Conducted According to Law, No Evidence of Corruption Found, Rising Prices Make It Difficult for Local Governments to Bear Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The fifth session of the Municipal Assembly continued its second meeting yesterday afternoon. First, the councilors raised general questions to Mayor Wu, who answered them one by one, lasting a total of one hour. Then, the directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Administration Bureaus respectively reported on the general situation of their work. After the reports, the councilors raised questions to the Finance Bureau, which Director Tian answered. There were also questions to the Land Administration Bureau, with the most opinions expressed on the issue of rental standards. Director Zhu also answered accordingly. The questioning of the Education Bureau and the director's answers were postponed to this afternoon due to lack of time.</p>
<p>The meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 2:00 PM, but at 2:20 PM, the quorum was still not met. The speaker announced that a forum would be held first. The official meeting began at 2:50 PM. The councilors first raised general questions to the mayor, including: Shao Yongsheng asked, (1) The paper stored in the paper shop is for business needs and has not been investigated. The government took it to the police station, which is a violation of the people's private property. Although it was returned later, who should be responsible for any losses during transportation? (2) A certain owner of a cigarette paper shop used years of savings to purchase silver and did not use it for profit. Why was it confiscated? Mayor Wu replied: The economic problem is the most difficult to deal with at present, but this is part of the central government's overall plan, and the local government has a smaller responsibility and no power itself. In the face of rising inflation, emergency measures must be taken. He feels ashamed that he failed to consider everything when implementing them. Regarding the case of the paper stored in the paper shop, the authorities did not take the paper away, but only checked the accounts. If it was found to be hoarding for speculation, it would be sent to the court. After investigation, it was found that there was no violation of the law, and the punishment was immediately revoked. The case of storing silver was investigated according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, and the power rests with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>The Rampant "Hen Mouse Brand" Is Not Ignored</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhongyuan asked whether the "Hen Mouse Brand" in the stock exchange is a legal organization and why the municipal government does not stop it. The mayor said that the Hen Mouse Brand is the so-called over-the-counter transaction. The authorities have tried their best to eliminate it, but have not been able to do so thoroughly, and it is not being ignored. Jiang Hao asked: (1) Very unpleasant things happened in the city's election, especially in the election of legislators. The turnout was not enthusiastic, but why were there so many votes in the end? Mayor Wu should be responsible as the chairman of the election office. What is the inside story? Did he order his subordinates to do things outside the law, or did he report any corruption? (2) What overall measures does the city government have to prevent rising prices in advance? (3) What has been done so far in terms of austerity? Can a statistical report be given? The mayor replied: (1) The election was conducted in accordance with the election law. The districts distributed ballots to citizens. He also attached great importance to this and sent four city government advisors to monitor it. However, manpower was limited, and the monitors did not see any corruption when they were on the scene. This kind of phenomenon may have occurred when they were not on the scene, but he personally never ordered his subordinates to violate the law. According to the central government's interpretation, it is legal to issue as many votes as were issued, as long as the number of votes returned does not exceed the original number. (2) The central government has its own decision-making power regarding the overall measures to prevent rising prices, and the local government cannot be fully responsible. (3) In terms of austerity, the prices of wine and dishes have been reduced as much as possible, and they have not been set according to the prices set by the wine and dish industry. As for the ban on dancing, he has no explanation and it is an order from the central government.</p>
<h3>No Power to Decide Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Yan Guodong said that the price of rationed rice must be limited. If it rises with the market price, it will have a negative impact. It should be adjusted once every three months or half a year. The mayor said that this is a central government regulation and the city has no power to set prices. Zhao Yangxiong proposed: (1) The city government should severely punish the murderer who insulted the mayor. Before any incident occurs in the future, the directly responsible person should have the leeway to handle it. Only when it cannot be resolved should the mayor make the final decision. (2) When will the committee for special relief donations be established in Shanghai? Can it be established immediately? What enforcement measures does the mayor have? The mayor first expressed his gratitude to the councilors for their concern, and then said that for the civil part of the case against the murderer, he did not want to prosecute because the injuries were not serious. The criminal part is handled by the court. He also replied: The committee for special relief donations will hold its first meeting this Friday. Huang Zhenshen asked whether raising interest rates on deposits at the Central Bank could fuel inflation and whether it could be negotiated with the central government. He replied that this is beyond the responsibility of the city government. Yang Gongshu expressed his hope that the rental standards should be adjusted reasonably. Wang Weixin said that according to the statistics of the 107 resolutions of the fourth assembly, the bureaus have completed or are in the process of completing 43 percent, and 57 percent have not been completed. He asked why? The mayor replied that the city government is doing its best to implement them. Those that have not been completed are due to actual difficulties, and the reasons have been submitted to the assembly for explanation.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Director Reports That More Primary and Secondary Schools Will Be Added</h3>
<p>Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou's work report mainly included the following points: (1) National education: There are currently 900 private primary schools and 269 municipal primary schools, with a total of 357,800 students, accounting for more than 80 percent of the city's school-age children. The Education Bureau is investigating the reasons for the approximately 100,000 children who are not enrolled. One part of this is because parents cannot afford the financial burden, and another part is child labor, and parents do not allow them to go to school. It is planned to increase the number of national primary school classes by 200 to 300 this autumn. The two national schools that have been prepared for opening recently are located on Macau Road and next to Jiaozhou Park. It is true that no school has been established in the Zhabei district, because no public land can be found or private land is sold but not suitable for building schools. Now the district office of the district plans to donate a school, so there will be at least one school in the near future. (2) Secondary education: The three schools to be built this year are Wusong Middle School, Yangjing Middle School, and Xinlu Normal School. The two middle schools in Yangshupu and Xinjing are being prepared. In the future, the establishment of middle schools will focus on vocational education. (3) Social education: There are a total of 189 community schools and 113 supplementary schools, with a total of more than 37,000 students. Future plans include promoting them in factories and shops. The promotion of national physical education will include the establishment of simple sports fields in parks. In addition, it is planned to build an art museum, a library, and a museum. (4) General education: Director Li solemnly declared that the municipal schools are absolutely not allowed to collect compulsory tuition fees. As for construction fees, it is hoped that one new school building can be built per semester after collection. This time, in order to handle the unified scholarship, it is planned to provide all 3,000 places for students in suburban areas to apply. Illegal educational groups will be cracked down on.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to establish contact between parents and schools, the Education Bureau specially promotes the holding of parent-teacher associations in each school. The school environment should also be improved as much as possible to make students interested in the school.</p>
<p>Due to lack of time yesterday, the questions to the Education Bureau and the director's answers will be continued this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Today's Agenda</h3>
<p>Today's agenda is: From 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, councilors will question the Education Bureau, and the director will answer. The directors of the Health, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus will report on their work. Councilors will ask questions, and the directors of each bureau will answer.</p>
<h3>Appropriate Handling of Labor Strikes and Student Protests: Assembly Resolves to Commend Four Chiefs</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Before the adjournment of yesterday's assembly, Speaker Pan proposed a temporary motion, jointly signed by more than ten councilors, including Vice-Speaker Xu, Du Yuesheng, Jin Runxiang, Xi Wangshu, Gao Shuan, and Chen Baotai. The motion was: "Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Director Yu, and Director Wu have taken appropriate measures in handling labor strikes and student protests, and it is proposed that the assembly commend them." The assembly unanimously approved the resolution to authorize the speaker and vice-speaker to express the association's appreciation. Mayor Wu and others were all present at the time, and they stood up and modestly declined, saying that as local leaders, handling events was their duty and they dared not accept the commendation.</p>
<h3>Director Zhu Explains the Process of Setting Rental Standards, Land Registration Is 90% Complete, Land Value Tax Collects 28.4 Billion</h3>
<p>Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping reported on his work and specifically explained the process of setting rental standards, saying that the government had to study and draft a bill on rental standards in terms of both facts and responsibilities. After August of last year, there was a standard for current rent, which was calculated based on 80 percent of the salary multiple of public school teachers, or 1,400 times. In October, it was increased to 3,200 times. But the situation is different this year. Public school teachers' salaries are calculated based on the cost of living index, so the rental multiple implemented last year cannot be applied. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau started research in January, and in accordance with the principle of "considering all aspects" in the resolution of the Provisional Assembly, it invited representatives from various agencies to solicit opinions. First, it was decided that a standard must be set, but a fixed multiple was difficult to establish. Later, a standard for the standard was found, that is, public school teachers' rent is calculated based on 10 percent of the index, or 8,500 times. But it is difficult to solve general problems. Later, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others convened a symposium and decided that the rent for the last three months should be calculated based on the average of the housing index of workers and employees for the first three months and announced every three months. The rent for cultural personnel and the poor is the same as that of public school teachers. In this way, most civilians have been taken care of, and those with ample economic power will not be treated harshly.</p>
<p>Regarding land registration, as of the end of last year, more than 90 percent of the investigations have been completed, and more than 10,000 cases are still under review. Last year's land value tax totaled more than 28.4 billion, exceeding the approved quota by more than 90 percent.</p>
<h3>Councilors Raise Questions, Saying Rental Standards Are Too High</h3>
<p>Most of the councilors' questions to the Land Administration Bureau involved the issue of rental standards, and they all expressed opposition. Zhang Zhongyuan said that setting the rental standard at 34,100 times is too high and does not match the actual survey results. Jiang Haoran, a councilor from the Democratic Socialist Party, said that the rental standard should be based on the lowest amount. The current rental multiple has not yet risen to such a high multiple. The authorities have increased it in advance. How does this help "stability first"? Ma Junshuo cited the rental regulations and the Land Law and said that there is no legal basis for determining rent according to the index. Fan Shouyuan said that the rental standard has set the highest amount. This highest amount will naturally become the lowest amount, because no landlord is willing to collect rent below the highest amount. Qian Songping asked about the clearing of public land in suburban areas. Yu Shun asked when the land declaration will be completed.</p>
<p>Director Zhu further explained and answered the "rental issue," saying that the highest rental standard was drafted by the central government. Once it is passed, it will be strictly enforced. Of course, it is also possible to set a lower multiple, but it is useless if the citizens do not comply. This is the original intention of setting this standard to stabilize society. Having a reasonable standard can reduce many disputes and lawsuits. The Legislative Yuan stipulates that the standard should be set according to the local economic situation, so it can be said that there is a legal basis. Director Zhu also explained that the so-called number of 34,100 times is not accurate and not so high. In fact, the calculation method should be as follows: For example, the rent for January, February, and March is calculated based on the average of the pure housing index of workers and employees for October, November, and December. The rent does not change in January, February, and March, and adjustments start in April. At this point, the meeting time had passed. Speaker Pan also added that the issue of rental standards has been submitted to the city government for discussion. You can wait for the discussion of the proposal for a long-term discussion. What is the current multiple has not yet been officially announced. At this point, the questioning came to an end.</p>
<h3>Teachers and Students Petition and Leave After Satisfactory Answers</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] More than ten petitions were filed to the Municipal Assembly yesterday. Among them, there were about 300 teachers, students, and parents from public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, demanding the distribution of supplies, higher salaries, payment of tuition fees at one time, immediate payment of year-end bonuses, monthly adjustment of the cost of living index, reduction of the burden on parents, free tuition fees should be the responsibility of the government, opposition to asking students for tuition fees, and increasing education funding to 35 percent. Later, Li, Acting Director of the Education Bureau, and Tong Xingbai and Jiang Jizhou, representatives of the Municipal Assembly, met with Shao Shuangqiu and six other representatives of the petition, and Acting Director Li gave a sincere reply, saying that the first two items are central administrative measures and the local authorities have no right to interfere. As for raising unified scholarships in order to increase the number of free places, this is an automatic donation from community members, not a responsibility. However, as he bears the heavy responsibility of managing education, he should care for young people who are determined to study. It has now been decided that for private schools with more than 25 percent of free places, the Education Bureau will be responsible for providing assistance. Students who are truly poor and have excellent grades can apply to the Education Bureau for free admission after verification. Fees charged by private schools exceeding the quota will be personally investigated in each school and ordered to be returned, and those responsible will be punished. If schools delay or deduct teachers' salaries for no reason, they can report to the Education Bureau and will be investigated and dealt with. Finally, he also hoped that all teachers would concentrate on education. The petitioning teachers and students were all satisfied with the above answers and left at about 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>In addition, residents of Tianmu Road once again requested the revocation of the order to demolish houses. The Shanghai Wine and Cuisine Industry Association requested that the banquet tax be reduced to 5 percent, and at most not exceed 12 percent.</p>
<h3>Prisoner Wu Fusheng Commits Murder and Escapes: Crime Upon Crime, Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Murderer Wu Fusheng, a member of Ding Xishan's troops, robbed a gold ring from the hand of a pedestrian Jin Huagui behind the International Hotel on March 13, 1946.

<h3>Solicitation of Aid Funds Closes at the End of the Month: Hope to Continue Donations to Reach 600 Million in Funds</h3>
<p>This newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund" has been soliciting donations for more than a month. Thanks to the sincere support and donations from countless enthusiastic readers, it has achieved very good results.

<h3>Director of Finance Bureau Reports That This Year's Tax Revenue May Exceed 4 Trillion</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Director of the Finance Bureau Tian Yongqian reported that the increase in total revenue in 1947 was barely able to cope with the increase in expenditures. However, this year is different. In business tax, the central government will handle special business tax, extracting 23.39 percent, and the manufacturing tax revenue will be halved, resulting in a loss of 17.31 percent. The central government will also extract 30 percent, so the total business tax that the city can collect is only 42 percent. The loss from the ban on dancing accounts for 16.5 percent of the entertainment tax, the loss from bars accounts for 12.5 percent, and the loss from restaurants with dance floors totals 30 percent. If this year's tax revenue is calculated according to the new tax rates set by the central government, 4.3 trillion yuan can be collected. The director said that he personally does not advocate raising taxes.</p>
<p>Regarding financial inquiries, Zhi Fu reported on the fraud of business tax, saying that personnel from the bureau often come to negotiate with general businesses. As soon as the report is about to be issued, if you want to underreport, they can help you through the process, but a handling fee is required. This handling fee is calculated based on the monthly interest rate of the business, with each person taking half. This matter has become an open secret. There are currently more than 60,000 businesses in the city. If each business has an average of 10 million, then the amount is considerable. How will the Finance Bureau deal with it? Li Wenjie expressed the hope that the Finance Bureau should pay attention to the use of money. Yu Shun requested that the city government request subsidies from the central government and reduce the amount of local revenue that is extracted.</p>
<p>Director Tian replied that the bureau will do its best to prevent tax fraud. He was not aware of what Councilor Shi said, but he will sincerely accept it. If the investigation is true, he will definitely deal with it severely.</p>
<h3>Escaped Japanese War Criminal from Jiangwan Captured: Nakano Hisatake First Tried to Escape to the Communist Area in Northern Jiangsu, but Returned to Shanghai Due to Lack of Travel Expenses and Was Arrested</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] It is confirmed that on the night of December 14 last year, Nakano Hisatake, the former Chief of the Special High Division of the Chongming Gendarmerie of the Japanese War Criminals, escaped from the Jiangwan War Criminals Prison without a trace. After the incident, Chairman Jiang in Nanjing heard about it and was very angry. He ordered the director of the war criminals prison, Zou Renzhi, to be dismissed and investigated. He was transferred to Nanjing a few days ago to await punishment. At the same time, the Ministry of National Defense ordered the escaped war criminal to be arrested. After receiving the order, a military agency in this city sent personnel to investigate separately. After more than ten days of investigation, Nakano Hisatake was finally arrested yesterday afternoon. According to the initial interrogation, after escaping from prison, the criminal intended to flee to the Communist area in northern Jiangsu, but after arriving in Jiading, he returned to Shanghai due to language barriers and lack of travel expenses. He wandered around the area north of Suzhou Creek, making a living by stealing car parts and cotton. He has now been arrested and temporarily sent to the police station for detention. A military agency has telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to report and request instructions on how to deal with the situation.</p>

<h3>Students Insult Mayor Case: Eleven Indicted, Remaining 30 Receive Non-Prosecution, Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Students of National Tongji University, previously protesting against the authorities' expulsion of a large number of students and opposing the student self-government association rules promulgated by the Ministry of Education, caused a disturbance. On the 29th of last month, more than 1,000 students gathered, preparing to petition in Nanjing. Students from other universities, including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Soochow University, Shanghai College of Law, St. John's University, and Tongde Medical College, also went to see them off, numbering in the hundreds. They were blocked by mounted police patrols, and a conflict occurred. Mayor Wu went to mediate and was also insulted and assaulted. Afterwards, forty-one suspected students were arrested and detained at the police station. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After investigation by prosecutors Huang Daping and Zhan Ruilin, the case was closed yesterday. The defendants Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Feng Liwen, Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, Xiong Zonglie, Wang Gongwei, Zhou Yongzhi, Sun Kema, Qu Yuping, and eleven others were indicted on charges of obstructing official duties and disturbing public order. The remaining defendants, Xue Yukun, Cheng Ganheng, Huang Renduan, Chen Minglian, and thirty others, were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of their crimes. The students who were not prosecuted were all released on bail last night.</p>
<p>The main points of the indictment are excerpted below: "Huang Kelu is the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tongji University Student Self-Government Association and the person in charge of the Nanjing Petition Delegation. Pan Chengbang is the chairman of the Student Self-Government Association and the person in charge of the Nanjing Petition Presidium. Feng Liwen is the vice chairman of the Student Self-Government Association. Wang Zongshu is a standing committee member of the Student Self-Government Association. Wang Weixin is the commander-in-chief of the Nanjing Petition Delegation. All have confessed without reservation. Zhang Jingyao and Xiong Zonglie admitted at the police station that they shouted slogans when organizing the team to petition in Nanjing, asking the students not to be discouraged. The above seven defendants are guilty of inciting others to violate Articles 1 and 2 of the Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order. According to Zhu Yifu's indication, Pan Chengbang, in addition to inciting others to violate the law, also added to the mayor.</p>
<p>Although Wang Gongwei denied assaulting the mayor, Hu Liping, a student from Xia Guang Middle School, testified at this office, 'I saw his back figure hit him, and then Mayor Wu said, 'This is outrageous.' I also saw a person wearing a khaki-colored shirt, who was Wang Gongwei. I saw that there was something wrong with his eyes.' After investigation, Wang Gongwei did have some problems with his eyes, which were particularly recognizable. The above testimony is credible.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Yongzhi also denied rioting, Jiang Hong, the dean of Tongji University, said that he indirectly heard that Zhou Yongzhi had pushed the mayor down, and did something very proud. Later, when this office went to the school to investigate, Jiang Hong said, 'I asked his classmate Shen Zuxuan yesterday, and he said that Zhou Yongzhi often met me on Tianqi Road, his shoes were already thrown off, and he was walking barefoot. Zhou said that he also fell down next to Mayor Wu, and Mayor Wu also fell down, and he pulled him up.' Referring to the above testimony before and after, the defendant is suspected of pushing Mayor Wu down.</p>
<p>Sun Kema is a student at St. John's University. Zhu Yifu testified at the police station, 'First, Sun Kema and Mayor Wu stood opposite each other across a ditch. At that time, Sun Kema loudly questioned the mayor, 'Why were the students Bai Zhao arrested by the police?' and demanded their immediate release. The mayor replied that if any students were arrested, he would be responsible for their release. However, Sun Kema's attitude was still very strong and aggressive, crossing the ditch, with a fierce momentum, ignoring persuasion. Later, when the student petition team rushed out, in the chaos of the mounted police team, Sun stepped forward and surrounded the mayor, reaching out to beat him. I saw it with my own eyes from the side.' Moreover, Sun admitted at the police station that he was impolite to the mayor when crossing the ditch. Even during the investigation in this office, he also admitted that he was unsteady and jumped over the ditch, and had once approached the mayor, using violent and coercive behavior, which can be confirmed.</p>
<p>Qu Yuping is a student at Tongde Medical College and also one of the people who beat the mayor. Zhang Jugong and Zhu Yifu testified clearly. In summary, Huang Kelu and others gathered more than 1,000 people, intending to petition in Nanjing. The victims Wu Guozhen and the police were injured in the conflict. Reporters from various newspapers interviewed and published clearly, and the facts are extremely obvious. The actions of the defendants Pan Chengbang violated Article 135, Paragraph 1, and Article 153, Amendment 2, and Article 50 of the Criminal Law. Huang Kelu, Feng Liwen, Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Tai Zonglie violated Article 153, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Wang Gongwei, Zhou Yongzhi, Sun Kema, and Qu Yuping violated Article 135, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Except for the injury part that was not legally prosecuted by the victim, it should be dismissed. They should be indicted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Bandit Captured in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Yulin Road Police Station arrested a notorious bandit from the Zhejiang waters on the 7th of this month in the South City. According to his confession, his name is Zhang Ankang, a native of Dinghai, nicknamed "Mixing Dragon." The interrogation has been completed and reported to the General Bureau, and he will be sent to the court for trial in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Wealthy Household Fate: He Guai Once Kidnapped Three Times, Also Coveted and Blackmailed by Fellow Villagers, Dinghai Road Bridge Contact, Case Cracked</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Ho Shao-ting, a 73-year-old contractor from Fenghua, resides at 84 Chang Le Road. On the morning of the 17th of last month, he suddenly received a threatening letter in the name of the "Mao Headquarters," requesting a payment of 40 million yuan to be delivered at 3:00 PM that afternoon near the Linqing Road tram station in Yangshupu. At the time, Ho ignored it. Unexpectedly, around 3:00 PM on the 6th of this month, he received a second threatening letter in the name of the "Yan'an Headquarters," demanding 300 million yuan. Later, Ho's son, Zengke, took the letter to the Lujiawan Police Station to report the case, requesting protection. After inspecting the letter, the police station dispatched plainclothes officers dressed as coppersmiths, farmers, peddlers, and rickshaw pullers to ambush at the agreed-upon Dinghai Road Bridge on the afternoon of the 7th. At the same time, Chen Rusheng, Ho Zengke's uncle, carried a black package in a privately owned car, disguised as cash, straight to the location. Before long, a young man approached, chatting in a low voice with Chen, claiming to be a representative of the "Yan'an Headquarters," ordering him to quickly hand over the cash. The ambushing police officers then swarmed out and captured him. After being taken to the station for interrogation, he confessed that his name was Hua Guoxiang, 21 years old, from Ningbo, and that he had resorted to this as a last resort due to unemployment. His accomplices included Yu Linbiao and Yan Jinlin, all former colleagues at the military uniform factory. The idea came from Yu, because Yu and Ho were from the same village, so he was familiar with his wealth. Based on the confession, the police station rushed to Xicaopeng in Lijia Bang, Nanxiang Town, overnight to arrest Yan. When officers were dispatched to Fenghua to capture the main culprit, Yu Linbiao, he had already fled far away. After investigation, it was learned that Ho was a wealthy man in Fenghua and had been coveted by bandits several times. The first time was in the 14th year of the Republic of China, when his mother was suddenly attacked and kidnapped by a large number of bandits from the Siming Mountains in the countryside of Fenghua, and died in the bandit's den. Ho was very filial to his mother, and later still redeemed his mother's remains and buried them. The second time, Ho himself was kidnapped in Shanghai, at the age of 54, and was shot in the leg on the spot. The third time, in the 31st year of the Republic of China, Ho's two sons were kidnapped to West Shanghai and held captive for more than a month before being redeemed with a huge sum of money.</p>

<h3>The Edge of the Northeast Heart</h3>
<p>[By Airmail Dispatch from Shenyang, 14th] The fossil-like ice patterns on the glass windows have disappeared, the snow caps on the treetops have been taken off, and the branches are shedding tears of joy. The crows are cawing noisily, expressing their inner joy and indicating that spring is about to come.</p>
<p>Shenyang is beginning to melt in the ice. The mud on the roads is three feet deep, comparable to the heavy fog in Chongqing. In some places, it has become a quiet lake surface, and a gust of wind allows you to recite the line "Shenyang spring waters rise." The horse manure all over the streets reveals the hateful appearance of garbage piles everywhere. Shenyang is like a candle melting, having lost its winter glory.</p>
<p>Artillery Fire on the South Bank of the Hun River</p>
<p>Shenyang before and after the Spring Festival shows unparalleled desolation. This is the third Spring Festival since the recovery. On the first day of the lunar new year, the air seemed more lively. People observed the ancient traditions, celebrating the new year, greeting each other with bows and hand gestures, giggling, "Congratulations and get rich," and after three or five sentences, they would chatter about "the situation in their hometown." Shenyang has become a world of refugees, numbering over 100,000 and increasing daily. The number of beggars on the streets has also increased several times. An old man recounted that his family property had been cleared out, and children were calling out to you, hoping to get a full meal during the Spring Festival. The Defense Command repeatedly ordered a ban on setting off firecrackers during the Spring Festival, but on the first day of the lunar new year, rumbling artillery fire came from both sides of the Hun River. The children wondered, who dared to set off firecrackers? This is truly the humor of the times.</p>
<p>Facing the Spreading Flames of War</p>
<p>The intense artillery fire slightly shook Shenyang, and the fall of Liaoyang, the key to southern Shenyang, into the hands of the bandits cast a stone in the hearts of the quiet people. Although the siege of Pan Yang made people worried, it did not cause the state of hysterical terror like during the "Fifth Offensive" by the Communists last May. The Northeast has experienced a harsh winter, and people's attitudes have changed to seriousness and perseverance. They have transitioned from emotional and frivolous judgments to rational and calm tests of the current difficult environment. The provocation of reality is enough to inspire courage. Today, people are facing the flames of war burning to the edge of this Northeast heart.</p>
<p>Remembering the Camel Corps</p>
<p>The establishment of the Northeast Bandit Suppression General Headquarters is the most important event of concern to the people of the Northeast. What the Northeast eagerly expects is the dispatch of elite troops to strengthen the Northeast's military and salvage the current crisis, especially to maintain transportation inside and outside the customs. Now, people still remember Fu Zuoyi's camel corps and can't help but beam when talking about Fan Hanjie's mechanized troops.</p>
<p>Population and Cigarette Exchange</p>
<p>The most difficult problem in Shenyang is transportation. Air transport is the only road to the interior. Although China and the Central Aviation Companies have three or five planes flying between Ping and Shen every day, it is still not enough for the needs of Shenyang. Compared to trains, the strength of air transport is really pitiful. Only two or thirty people can travel in a month, which is not even enough for a train. There are many people who want to leave Shenyang. In order to arm itself, Shenyang hopes that all those who want to leave will leave. What it needs here is food, not population. What Shenyang sends out is population, and what it brings back is cigarettes. However, what it desperately needs is flour. This uncoordinated phenomenon has caused great resentment.</p>
<p>Foreigners Willing to Suffer</p>
<p>It is not easy to live in Yang. Foreigners also feel something about it. The livelihoods of many White Russians, Germans, Belgians, and Czechs have declined. Gao Liang rice at 3,000 yuan per catty in the circulating currency makes them very distressed. They have recently been busy looking for ways to get plane tickets. An elderly German man said: He had only tasted this kind of pain in Germany at the end of World War I. He left Germany after the war and has always hated it. When talking about the Nazis, his temper got even worse. He hated Hitler's followers to death. He said that the divided Germany after World War II also had no hope, and he was willing to continue suffering in China. The old man's sorrow made me think that it is not only us Chinese who are suffering on this earth.</p>
<p>Donkey and Horse Meat Abound</p>
<p>The counties near Shenyang are turbulent and uneasy. The coming and going, fighting and stopping of the war make it impossible for the common people to live well. Most of those with savings run to Shenyang. The houses in the Shenyang city gate are crammed full, and rent and sales prices are rising in comparison.</p>
<p>Some of the cattle and horses of the rural farmers have been requisitioned by both sides, and some, fearing the fate of loss, have mostly rushed to the Shenyang Mule and Horse Market and sold them at low prices. Many people who buy livestock do not ask the age of the livestock, but only look at whether they are thin or fat. It is said that these donkeys and horses that were bought were "put in the pot." Isn't that so? The cooked meat market is full of donkey and horse meat.</p>
<p>Chickens, Ducks, Pigs, and Dogs Suffer</p>
<p>Another reason for the rural farmers to sell their plowing mules and horses is that fodder is expensive because a lot of the fodder used to feed mules and horses has been resold for personal gain through extortion and sale - chickens, ducks, pigs, and dogs have suffered the same fate, without the strength to keep them alive until the spring plowing, let alone whether spring plowing is possible, which is a big problem?</p>
<p>The countryside is poor, and the city is in dire straits. Shenyang and its surroundings have suffered together. Food is expensive, everything costs a lot of money, and traffic is cut off, which further increases inflation. Here, oranges cost about 800,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, rice costs about 890,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, Gao Liang rice sells for 60,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, pork costs 240,000 yuan per catty in legal tender, and an egg costs 36,000 yuan per catty in legal tender. How can life not be difficult?</p>
<p>Shenyang has many hardships and certainly needs to be self-reliant, but it also urgently needs national support! (Special Correspondent Han Qingtao. Reporter Zhao Zhan)</p>

<h3>Changsha Warms Up on the Lantern Festival, Lanterns Are Sparse</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Changsha, 24th] Today is the Lantern Festival. The weather in Changsha cleared for the first time in February. The spring sun shines, and the climate is warming up. However, the market is sluggish, and the lanterns are sparse, no longer the scene of a prosperous age.</p>
<h3>The Annihilation of Ding Xishan's Bandit Gang</h3>
<p>[Our Fengxian Dispatch, 22nd] The local communist bandit gang of Ding Xishan stealthily landed on the beach at Shiqiaotou in Qianqiao Township, this county. They were encircled and attacked by our powerful national army and the security teams and self-defense forces of various counties and townships. Finally, on the 18th, the entire bandit gang was wiped out near Dianshan Lake. The bandit leader, Ding Xishan, was killed on the spot. The local authorities have sent personnel to identify and confirm the body. It is also reported that his head will be taken to Fengxian and displayed to the public. The following is a more systematic account of the encirclement and suppression in Punan, obtained by our reporter from relevant sources, and includes information not yet published in other newspapers.</p>
<p>According to Wang Rong, the bandit gang's chief of staff (and Ding's nephew) who surrendered on the 17th, he told our visiting reporter that on the 28th day of the 12th lunar month of last year, Ding led his gang from Doulonggang in northern Jiangsu, sailing on one large boat and one small boat across the sea. There were only sixty-odd people, carrying five light machine guns, twenty rifles, ten Thompson submachine guns, several various pistols, twelve hundred hand grenades, and over ten thousand rounds of ammunition. They planned to land on New Year's Eve to stealthily attack Fengxian, but due to tidal conditions, they only anchored off Shiqiaotou in Qianqiao Township on the second day of the new year. They landed around 8 or 9 pm on the third night. Due to the inconvenience of carrying the hand grenades, they buried them on the beach. That night, after landing, they went to Panjiajiao in the southwest of this county to rest. The next day (the 13th), they planned to invade Nanqiao. Ding had brought eighteen taels of gold with him for supplies, believing that he could establish a base and rally his old troops after landing in Punan based on his past influence. Therefore, his planned objectives were: (1) to collect the weapons of the self-defense forces in this county, (2) to rally Ding's former subordinates, (3) to recruit new soldiers, (4) to avenge comrades who had been arrested or killed, and (5) to raise funds and provisions. Fortunately, County Magistrate Xi and the stationed troops were well-prepared and had accurate intelligence. As soon as they received a secret report of the bandits' presence, County Magistrate Xi immediately mobilized the county security team, the national army in Nanqiao and Zhalin, and the self-defense teams of Zhuangxing and Zilong townships to encircle and suppress them from multiple routes on the afternoon of the 13th. The bandits were caught off guard and abandoned their packs, fleeing westward in disarray. Our authorities not only sent teams to track them down but also telegraphed the garrison headquarters and the district security headquarters to dispatch powerful reinforcements to block and search for them in different directions. County Magistrate Xi spent the whole day and night on the phone, listening to reports and directing the operations.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the remnants of the bandit gang were discovered again, causing disturbance in Yinglongmiao, on the border of this county. County Magistrate Xi personally led the security and self-defense teams, together with the National Army XX Regiment, to encircle and suppress them. At the same time, Zhu Zhong, Deputy Commander of the 3rd District Security Department of Songjiang, also personally led his team to join the encirclement and attack. The bandits had no chance to catch their breath and were finally defeated by our army, scattering westward in two groups like fallen flowers. One group of ten or twenty people, led by Tang Jingyan, the deputy commander of the bandit gang, fled to Wangjiadai in Yanduntou. When our defense teams reported and encircled them, the bandits had already broken into smaller groups and slipped through the gaps to cross the Pu River and flee westward. The other group of forty or fifty bandits, led by Ding himself, tried to flee to Dianshan Lake but were completely surrounded by our powerful national army units and security and self-defense teams from various counties and districts. They were attacked from all sides, and finally, on the 18th, the entire bandit gang was wiped out. The bandit leader, Ding Xishan, was killed on the spot. The good news spread, and the people were overjoyed.</p>
<p>The complete annihilation of Ding's bandit gang in Punan in the shortest possible time was due to the close coordination, accurate intelligence, high morale, and diligent efforts of the powerful national army units and local security and guard teams. County Magistrate Xi's ability to raise vigilance and command decisively before the bandits could establish a foothold, and his giving them a fierce blow first, should also not be overlooked in this campaign.</p>
<p>Ding was originally from Wujiaqiao Town in this county (previous reports stated Zhuangxing, which was incorrect). Before the war, he was a kidnapper. In 1936, he was imprisoned for kidnapping. He was released only after the outbreak of the War of Resistance. He joined the guerrillas and was active in southeastern Pudong. Later, he surrendered to the puppet regime and served as a puppet division commander, stationed in both northern and southern Pujiang, with great influence. Later, he was transferred to Shaoxing by the enemy and puppet regime. He attempted to defect to our side but was discovered by the Japanese enemy and imprisoned. He later managed to escape from prison and went to the free area. Before the victory, Ding led his troops to Fengxian. After the restoration and reorganization, he was reassigned to the traffic police and stationed in Qingdao. Last summer, he was wanted by the Ministry of National Defense for a case. Ding secretly joined the bandits, gathered his old troops, and went to the bandit area in northern Jiangsu for training. Ding was inherently stubborn, arrogant, and capricious. According to the bandit staff officer Wang Rong, who surrendered on the 17th and is now living in the county police station, after the Zhang Xianghe bandit case last year, he was implicated and fled to Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Pixian. Later, he returned to Shanghai. Ding ordered him to go with him, deceiving him by saying that they were going to Shanxi and that Commander-in-Chief Ma Zhichao would also go. They took a sailboat and went to the bandit area in northern Jiangsu, where he found out the truth. When he first arrived in northern Jiangsu, he had no official title. Later, he was appointed as a "battalion commander." When they set off, he was appointed as the chief of staff. The bandits' life was two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, and only 1,200 yuan per month in "Central China Bank" banknotes. He was not accustomed to the life and did not want to leave a bad name, so after landing in Qianqiao, he made an excuse to go home and make arrangements. On the fourth day of the new year (the 13th), he left the bandit gang and tried to surrender to the authorities. (Our Correspondent, Wang Jianqiu)</p>

The locusts are slightly smaller than the locusts that appear in the summer and resemble long-legged wasps. They fly in swarms and eat the evergreen pine needles in the forests. The locusts stay on the pine trees, jumping and moving incessantly, like silkworms eating mulberry leaves, making a rustling sound. The continuous spring snow, accumulating to over a foot thick, slightly suppressed the locust plague. After the Spring Festival, the snow cleared and the weather warmed up, and the locusts continued to wreak havoc as before. The locusts have spread over dozens of miles, and the ancient pine forests that once covered the borders of Xiuning and Wuyuan counties have all become barren and withered. According to the mountain farmers, after the pine needles are bitten by the locusts, the resin is completely drained, and the trees will eventually die. It is estimated that over one million pine trees in the two counties have been eaten, representing an unprecedented and huge loss to the forests of Huizhou.</p>
<h3>800 Tons of Relief Rice from Anhui Distributed to Various Counties for Supervised Release</h3>

According to Secretary Shi of the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, after Director Jin of the Ministry of Social Affairs' Anhui Relief Supervision Team inspects and hands over the rice on the 25th, it will be distributed to Tongcheng, Huaining, Wangjiang, Susong, Taihu, and Qianshan counties, to be supervised and released by public-spirited gentry in each county, who must be careful in their conduct and moral character. Each county may receive about 30 tons of relief rice, which will benefit the victims of the spring famine.</p>
<h3>Deng Meikui, Leader of Tenant Farmers in Yiyang, Murdered</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 24th] In Hunan, the "Two-Five Rent Reduction" policy is being strictly enforced. Deng Meikui, the leader of tenant farmers in Zhenyan Township, Yiyang, mobilized local tenant farmers last year to implement this law and established a farmers' association, of which he was elected as a standing director. On the 2nd of this month, before Deng got out of bed, six men in short clothes, carrying weapons, broke into Deng's house, tied him up, dragged him to the edge of a deep pit more than ten feet away from his house, and shot him three times, killing him. When the news spread, the directors and supervisors of the township farmers' association fled, and thousands of other members took their wives and children to hide in the deep forests, living in the open and enduring hardship. Even during the Spring Festival, they did not dare to show their faces and enjoy family happiness. It is reported that since this incident occurred, tenant farmers have returned the reduced rent grain of "Two-Five Rent Reduction" in order to save their lives.</p>

<h3>Extravagant Gambling in Overseas Chinese Hometowns: Using US Dollars as a Desperate Gamble</h3>

<h3>Mei Zhanyi Arrives in Suzhou to Review Military Service in Three Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 24th] Major General Mei Zhanyi, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning to convene a military service review meeting for Wu County, Wujiang, and Changshu. Du Xu, the commander of the Wu County Regiment Management District, and all levels of directors, as well as the county magistrates and military section chiefs of the three counties, were summoned to attend and listen to instructions. In the afternoon, Mei inspected the new recruits' brigade and returned to Shanghai by train number 71 that evening. Our reporter inquired about the date of the upcoming conscription, as there are conflicting rumors circulating and the people are at a loss. Mei said that all areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Garrison District will implement it simultaneously, without precedence, to prevent some ignorant young men from evading it. It has now been decided that the period until the end of this month will be the preparation period, and the drawing of lots will begin in March, with the conscription order issued at the same time.</p>

<h3>Antiques of the Ancient Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Airmail Dispatch, 20th] China is an ancient country, and Chang'an (now Xi'an) is an ancient capital. Therefore, it is not surprising to see antiquities from hundreds or thousands of years ago here. Several old gentlemen from the Shaanxi Provincial History Museum and private collectors have told our reporter that as long as roads are built in Guanzhong, airports are built, irrigation canals are dug, and even sometimes when a well is dug, ancient objects such as pottery, clayware, stoneware, and bronzeware are unearthed. (Not long ago, someone dug up hundreds of ancient clay figurines for funerary purposes, the so-called "terracotta warriors," at a construction site. Later, they realized that it was an ancient tile kiln for making "terracotta warriors.") The excavation of antiquities is no longer surprising news in Chang'an.</p>
<p>Objects of crude pottery, like "terracotta warriors", that are very old are not worthy of being placed in glass display cabinets in Xi'an's antique shops. When unearthed, they are still piled up on the floor of chairs and tables. An insider said that these cheap antiques are rarely faked. Therefore, Chairman Lin Sen liked to collect them. Although Qin bricks and Han tiles unearthed near Xi'an are constantly being smuggled out, many are still preserved. The texts, patterns, and designs on the bricks and tiles are worth appreciating. Speaking of the patterns on the back of ancient mirrors, they are even more complex and diverse. Recently, a collector exhibited hundreds of different ancient mirrors during the Spring Festival. Even if we don't consider them to be products of the Han and Tang Dynasties, the exquisite patterns are often breathtaking. Scattered stone carvings that are unearthed sometimes also have high artistic value.</p>
<p>At the same antique exhibition, our reporter discovered a fragmented statue of unknown age, about three feet high, with its hair rolled high on its forehead and draped over its shoulders. The clothing on its chest was partially bare, with the breasts exaggeratedly enlarged and the waist exaggeratedly narrowed, forming a contrast. (The nipples are also emphasized). The lines of the body only widen again at the local pelvis, and the hem of the lower garment has a "round taste". What is even more ingenious is that the two calves below the knee are completely naked. Unfortunately, the foot part is missing; otherwise, if there were a pair of high heels, it would be a 100% "Madhavi"! - From this, we can know that the so-called "fashion" is just a cycle of rotation in the ages, going round and round. The Shaanxi Provincial History Museum is located in the famous "Stele Forest", and its collection is also quite rich, but it is still not open to the public. After visiting, our reporter was most interested in the "terracotta warriors" and "funerary objects", which will be reported in another article when the opportunity arises. (Our Reporter, Ma Ye)</p>

<h3>Xi'an Spring Couplet Fully Reveals the Plight of Tenants</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Airmail Dispatch, 19th] Xi'an is experiencing a housing shortage, and the rental standard regulations promulgated by the municipal government are probably only beneficial to the residents of municipal government properties. This year, during the grand New Year, a unique spring couplet was posted at No. 28 Yandian Street, known as the "Wall Street" of Xi'an, which revealed the severity of the rent problem here. The two sides of the spring couplet read: "Our housing is too expensive" and "The rent is going to increase fourteenfold." Above the door lintel, the three characters "Cannot Afford" are written horizontally.</p>
<p>Today, our reporter went to the door to take pictures. The owner, Yang Xiaojie, came out with his hands clasped, speaking with a Shanxi accent, and told our reporter that the rent increase was unreasonable. He also said, "I am a long-time reader of Shen Bao. Please, please, let Shen Bao speak up for us." (Our Reporter, Ma Ye)</p>

<h3>Number of New Students in Guangzhou Municipal Elementary and Secondary Schools Only One-Tenth of Last Year; High Prices Make it Impossible for Parents to Afford Education for Their Children</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 24th Dispatch] The winter vacation for Guangzhou municipal and provincial elementary and secondary schools has ended, and classes resumed on the 23rd.

This is truly a looming educational crisis.</p>

Jin scored 30 points alone, which was very rare. After the start of the game, Tisheng once led by 6 to 2, but Jianle soon surpassed them. Tisheng called two timeouts, but it still didn't work. After 13 to 12, Jianle scored 14 consecutive points. As a result, Tisheng was behind by half at 20 to 40. After the change of sides, Jianle still controlled the overall situation. Tisheng's Tang Mingxin and Chen Wenzao scored a lot, but it was not worth the loss. When the bell rang, Jianle defeated Tisheng by a wide margin of 80 to 49.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Decides to Sell Rice Unlimitedly from Today; Rice Market in Chaos Yesterday, Asking Prices Rise Sharply Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Rice prices fluctuated sharply yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to resume unlimited sales of rice in the market from today to meet the needs of the citizens. The sales price is 2.25 million yuan per stone, and the retail price is calculated by adding 6% legal profit. At the same time, all retail rice shops are required to mark their prices, and the police bureau will send personnel to patrol each district. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Nanshi rice market registered 3351 stones and 5 dou of goods arriving, and the Beishi market registered 3533 stones and 5 dou. All parties believe that the authorities' relaxation of price limits should stabilize the market. However, due to the soaring prices in Wuxi districts, customers fear that they will not be able to replenish their stock after selling it, so they refuse to release it, resulting in a shortage of goods and a chaotic market, with transactions almost at a standstill. Rice shops in this street have stopped allocating rice, so there are no goods to replenish in the market. Therefore, they do not hesitate to increase prices to buy in, but only a few are doing business. In addition, stimulated by the rise in other prices, people are unsettled, and asking prices are rising sharply again. Special white japonica rice reached a new high price of over 2.5 million yuan, a surge of more than 10% compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The rise in flour prices is like a horse running wild, completely out of control. The reported rise in tin prices is the most exciting factor, and the factory's refusal to sell is the main reason for stimulating the rise in the flour market. Owners are asking exorbitant prices, but there is no shortage of buyers. At the opening in the morning, old cart flour was as high as 1.32 million yuan, and Bingshen flour rose all the way to a new record of 1.3 million yuan. Retailers took profits and sold at high prices, and the trend stabilized. Old cart flour closed at 1.29 million yuan, and Bingshen flour closed at 1.28 million yuan, a rise of almost 15% compared to the previous day. There was no shortage of buyers for bran, which opened at 790,000 yuan in the morning and once rose to 830,000 yuan. Finally, due to the slight decline in the flour market, it closed at 800,000 yuan, a rise of 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Due to the soaring rice prices, the price of coarse grains and yellow beans increased and the customers absorbed all available goods from Hankou at a morning opening price of 1.55 million yuan, which increased to 1.6 million yuan due to inability to acquire supply. Corn opened due to demand from Qingdao traders. Qi dong corn was at 1.78 million and reached 1.85 million at closing, with a price rise of approximately 200,000 yuan. Sorghum and mung beans all rose 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Sesame of Tianjin was actively purchased with Hankou white sesame doing 3.4 million for a gain of 300,000 and Jiujiang milk sesame at 2.95 million for a gain of 200,000. Raw peanuts jumped up by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Under the crazy price increase for rice and grains, edible oil and Wuxi prices constantly rising with a loose banking system where excess funds seeped in, edible oil price increases were even more insane, creating new highs. Yesterday's market was even more extreme, with abnormal conditions and very little product to purchase. Sellers were asking astounding prices, and raw oil was trading for 6.6 million, an increase of 800,000. Soybean oil opened at 5.8 million, reaching 6 million at one point and coming down to 5.9 million for an increase of 620,000. Rapeseed and sesame oil all rose by 600,000 and transactions were limited due to the lack of available goods. Soy meal followed with the oil prices, surging by 60-70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Before Close, China Shares Sparkled; Maya Underwear Hit Limit</h3>
<p>China shares saw buying interest falter in the middle of the day but strengthened before closing, boosting confidence among operators. Before closing, nineteen companies ended at the limit.

<h3>Chaos in Guangzhou City; Authorities Take Strict Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 24th Dispatch] Financial prices here continue to rise sharply, with unrest in various industries and chaos in the city. Citizens are extremely anxious and hope that the authorities will take effective measures to stabilize prices. Soong Ziwen has already telegraphed back to Guangdong, instructing that all possible measures be taken to effectively stabilize prices and ensure that grain prices in the province quickly recover. The Governor's Office held a meeting on the 23rd, deciding to strictly crack down on hoarding, manipulation, and other situations.

<h3>U.S. Revision of Gold Policy Currently Unnecessary</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A United Press dispatch from New York recently reported on the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers' proposal for a new gold price. Our reporter specially visited an economic expert in this city who stated: At present, a revision of the gold policy in the United States is practically impossible. Although gold production in the United States has faced rising labor costs since the war, production has continued to increase. Last year, total production reached $80 million, nearly half of the peak production of 1940 before the war. Furthermore, there has been a large influx of gold from foreign countries after the war. Therefore, there is no need to further increase the price of gold to stimulate gold production. With the European Recovery Program underway, there is no concern about exports, and there is even less reason to lower the value of the dollar by raising the gold price to create commercial competition. Recently, with France's opening of its gold market, foreign countries inevitably make various speculations about the American gold market. In fact, France is not the only place in the world with a free gold market, and the United States is in a different situation and has no need to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Money Shops Have Already Loaned Out 600 Million Yuan in Small Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The city's money shop small loan syndicate has, since its establishment, already underwritten more than 110 cases, with a total amount of over 600 million yuan. Today, the syndicate will convene a joint meeting of the review and auditing groups to review the loan work, it is said.</p>
<h3>National Banks Transfer Large Amounts In; Monetary Conditions Still Relaxed</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the new year, national banks have large daily transfers in, with another transfer of 464.4 billion yuan yesterday. Statistics show that since the Spring Festival, the total amount transferred in has reached a huge sum of over 2.7 trillion yuan. However, monetary conditions in the market remain quite relaxed. The flow of idle funds from other areas into Shanghai is greater than the tightening of monetary conditions by the national banks, resulting in an abundance of cash. Also, yesterday's "check clearing totaled 87,782 items, with a total amount reaching 4,476,808,628,000 yuan."</p>
<h3>Tea Market Sentiment Firm</h3>
<p>Domestic tea sales continued the upward trend of the previous day, coupled with the continued strong buying interest from both local and out-of-town merchants. Amidst the soaring prices of all goods, this further strengthened market confidence, and sellers' intention to raise prices became even more intense. As a result, the underlying bullish sentiment became even stronger, and prices uniformly rose step by step, to an extent that was almost immeasurable. However, trading volume was still sparse due to the shortage of supply. As for the foreign tea market, the process remained quiet, mainly due to the extremely high tea prices, and the interest of exporters was intermittent and not active. The opening prices rebounded again in a roundabout way.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Speculation in Yarn and Cloth; Yarn Control Committee Sends Inspectors; Market Must Report Daily Transaction Volume</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Due to the recent severe fluctuations in yarn prices, the Yarn Control Committee, in order to prevent speculation by non-industry individuals and curb rising prices, specially sent Director Weng of the Inspection Department, along with several inspectors, to the yarn and cloth markets yesterday morning (the 24th), accompanied by Section Chief Liu of the Daily Necessities Section of the Police Bureau, and economic police, to crack down on speculation by non-industry individuals and price gouging. The responsible personnel of the two markets were instructed to report the transaction volume of each broker yesterday to the guild for verification and transfer. Starting immediately, the transaction volume must be entered on the transaction slip, with one copy each for the buyer and seller, and the remaining copy sent to the yarn and cloth group for auditing. In the yarn market, in addition to the Yarn Merchants Guild Director Yin Peiyuan and Yarn Control Committee Inspection Department Director Weng announcing on the spot a strict crackdown on speculation, an emergency notice was immediately posted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to understand the yarn allocation status of each business and prevent speculation and hoarding, the Yarn Control Committee specially sent personnel to the acting agency of the China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday to investigate the allocated merchants and the amount of yarn allocated, in order to thoroughly investigate and handle the situation.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a decline in prices. The Yarn Control Committee's restrictions on shipments to the south remained in effect, and measures such as inspecting warehouses and registering yarn numbers were implemented, causing market sentiment to weaken suddenly. Buyers reduced their purchases, and both local and out-of-town merchants showed less interest, leading to a collapse in prices. 41-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened hovering around the 90 million yuan mark, but later, speculators took the opportunity to short the market, pushing the price down to 89 million yuan at closing, a sharp drop of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day. More of the 21-count "Double Horse" yarn was sold off, with prices falling by 5.5 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn fell generally from 1.89 million to 5.45 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices Slightly Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with a weaker tone, influenced by the weak yarn market, causing panic among traders, and many floating accounts rushed to cut losses. Hankou and Guangdong merchants also sold off, and asking prices were more chaotic than usual. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell to 2.13 million yuan, but dye factories and cloth merchants absorbed the supply at the lower price, resulting in a rebound to 2.27 million yuan at closing, a slight increase of 25,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other fine cloth also fell by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan. "Zhen Zhong" cloth, with its active sales, rose by 50,000 yuan. In addition, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and fabrics such as zigong floral drill and shilin cloth continued to rise by about 10,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's raw cotton market was weak due to the decline in cotton yarn prices and weakening market sentiment. Buyer interest waned, the market was oversupplied, and trading was thin, with only 70 bales traded. 8/7 middling cotton opened at 12.235 million yuan, and Guide cotton at 10.91 million yuan, these prices being the godown delivery prices. Zhoupu seed cotton, due to rising rice prices, farmers were unwilling to sell easily, and prices in the production areas increased, with the trend remaining high. Yesterday's opening price was 2.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] China Textile Construction Corporation sold cloth yesterday as usual, with a total of 28,880 bolts of cloth and 830 bedsheets sold. There were 1,004 applications, of which 44 were from manufacturers, purchasing 2,060 bolts of cloth, and the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Begins Purchasing Western Medicines and Communications Equipment</h3>

<p>Literature</p>
<h3>Woman Writer Freda Utley</h3>
<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>Everyone should remember this female writer—Freda Utley—who once wrote a book called "Japan's Feet of Clay." At a time when Japan was invading China while singing praises of friendship, she exposed the truth about Japan and aroused the attention of the British and American people. She was one of the first people who were willing to help China. The book had attracted many American readers. The Chinese translation was also once very popular. When she came to Chongqing after the victory, there were still many people who mentioned the book.</p>
<p>She grew up in England, went to Switzerland, studied history at the University of London, and economics at the London School of Economics. She was very well-regarded. Later, she went to the Soviet Union to become one of the Far East experts at the Moscow Institute of Political Economy. She married a Soviet comrade and lived with him for six years until her husband was taken away by the secret police. Only then did she escape to the United States. When she was disappointed in the Soviet Union, she wrote a book called "Lost Illusion." After her husband was imprisoned in a concentration camp, she wrote another book called "The Dream We Lost," which recounted her life experiences.</p>
<p>She was a journalist and worked as a correspondent for the Manchester Guardian, the London News Chronicle, and Reader's Digest. While in Shanghai, she also wrote articles for the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury.</p>
<p>She visited China three times: the first time in 1928, during the split between the Nationalists and the Communists. The second time was in 1938, which was the second year of the War of Resistance, and she escaped on the eve of the fall of Wuhan. She witnessed China's War of Resistance with her own eyes. The third time was in 1945, first to Chongqing and then to Yan'an. She was in Chongqing when the Political Consultative Conference was held.</p>
<p>She has recently written another book called "The China Story," which has sixteen chapters, in which she strenuously advocates that the United States must immediately provide comprehensive aid to China in terms of morality and its own practical interests. She believed that the United States must at least lend China two to three billion U.S. dollars in order to revive China. She is an expert on Far Eastern issues, understands the actual situation in China, and also understands the psychology of the American people. Her analysis is very clear and understandable. Her writing style is very fluent, and she excels at writing political commentary, speaking eloquently, and with warmth.</p>
<p>She criticized American foreign policy, saying that its weakness lies not in its inconsistency, but in its indecisiveness, so it cannot achieve its goals. The United States often fails to adopt a tough foreign policy to prevent the outbreak of war at critical moments. If it had severed economic ties with Japan at the beginning of its invasion of China, then why would it have had to fight so many bloody battles later?</p>
<p>She said that the United States still has time to adopt a wise, far-sighted, and practical policy towards China, which is to use all its strength to support China and prevent it from fighting alone for the sake of democratic countries.</p>
<h3>Reunion - Film Script (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Dao</p>
<p>30. Zheng Jingye's Bedroom (December 1946)</p>
<p>Jingye is half-reclining on a sofa chair in his bedroom. Xiuzhen is sitting at a long table beside her, writing.</p>
<p>Jingye: (After reading the words written by Xiuzhen in his hand.) You write very well. You must write every day from now on, don't be lazy.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Okay, I won't be lazy. (Opens a drawer and takes out a photo of a baby, which is the one Jingye collected back then.) Mr. Zheng, whose photo is this?</p>
<p>Jingye: (Surprised.) Where did you get this?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I found it in your diary. When we were in Guilin, my dad had a photo of me when I was little, and it was the same as this one.</p>
<p>Jingye: (Changes the subject.) This is a photo of my friend's child. It must be different from the one your dad has.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Suddenly pushes the door open, holding a newspaper in her hand.) Xiuzhen, what's your mother's name? I forgot.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: It's, it's, Guo Canyun.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Very happy.) Then that's right! (Xiuzhen and Jingye are both confused.)</p>
<p>Jingye: (Asks anxiously.) What's right?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Picks up the newspaper and reads.) Listen to this! "He Qi's Missing Person Notice:</p>
<p>When the enemy invaded Guizhou in early December 1944, my wife, Guo Canyun, took our eight-year-old daughter, Xiuzhen, and fled to Guizhou. The mother and daughter were separated in the bombing chaos in Liuzhai. My daughter is still missing. My wife and I have now returned to Shanghai. If any kind person can help find my daughter, I will send a reward of 20 million yuan. Sincerely, He Qi. Address: No. 1001 Anhe Temple Road, Shanghai. Telephone: 99990." (After Mrs. Zheng finishes reading, she looks at Jingye. Jingye has complex emotions and is a little dazed. Xiuzhen doesn't seem to fully understand the contents of the notice yet.) Xiuzhen, do you understand?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Auntie, does that mean my mother has been found?</p>
<p>Jingye: (Calmly.) Yes. Xiuzhen, your parents have placed an advertisement looking for you. Now that we know their address, we can ask them to come and take you back.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Looking very happy, but seeing that Jingye is not very happy, she doesn't dare to show it. She runs to Jingye's side.) Mr. Zheng, why don't you come and live at my house too, okay?</p>
<p>Jingye: (Jingye hugs her lovingly.) Good child, how can I go and live at your house?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (About to cry.) Why can't you? You treat me well, and I want to be with you.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Silly child! Aren't you happy that you have a mother? Mr. Zheng is going to live in our house. Little sister, let's go downstairs and discuss it, okay?</p>
<p>(Xiuzhen is still in the room. Jingye and Mrs. Zheng go downstairs.)</p>
<p>31. Zheng Family Living Room</p>
<p>Jingye: (Feeling very uncomfortable, pacing back and forth in the room. Sister-in-law is also silent. Finally, he makes a decision.) Sister-in-law, please call the He family and tell them that we will send Xiuzhen to them tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Little sister, are you sure that's what you want to do? Don't you want to think about it more carefully?</p>
<p>Jingye: No need. Please just make the call.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Probing.) Hmph! Returning their daughter to them for only 20 million yuan is too cheap. We should ask for 100 million!</p>
<p>Jingye: Sister-in-law, we can't do that.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Why not?</p>
<p>Jingye: No reason! (Anxiously.) If you don't make the call, I'll make it myself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Of course I'll make it. (Hesitates for a while, picks up the phone on the table, and dials the number.)</p>
<p>Hello! Is this 99990? ... Is this the He residence? Please let Mr. He Qi answer the phone. ... Mr. He has gone to Hong Kong, so can Mrs. He talk instead? ...</p>
<p>32. He Qi's New Home Living Room, Shanghai</p>
<p>Canyun is knitting a wool sweater in the room. The servant comes to inform her.</p>
<p>Servant: Madam, there's a phone call.</p>
<p>(Canyun walks out the door and answers the phone by the stairs.)</p>
<p>Canyun: Hello! Who is this? Yes. Oh, the Zheng residence, this is Mrs. He. Yes, my name is Guo Canyun. We posted the advertisement. What? Xiuzhen is with you? (Delighted.) May I ask where you live? 918 Ferguson Road? Can I come to your house right away? Okay, I'll be there right away!</p>
<p>(Canyun hangs up the phone. Very happy, she dials a number again.)</p>
<p>Canyun: Please send a car to the He residence at No. 1001 Anhe Temple Road immediately. Hurry!</p>
<p>33. Road</p>
<p>A taxi from the Xiang Sheng Company speeds to the front of the Zheng family's house.</p>
<p>34. In Front of Zheng Family's House</p>
<p>The car stops. Canyun gets out of the car, pays the fare, rings the doorbell, and the Zheng family's servant leads her inside.</p>
<p>35. Zheng Family Living Room</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng is in the living room. Canyun enters the living room.</p>
<p>Canyun: I am Guo Canyun. Are you Mrs. Zheng?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Yes, Mrs. He, please sit down. (The two sit down separately)</p>
<p>Canyun: (Hesitantly.) Mrs. Zheng, I hope what you told me on the phone is true, that is truly my daughter. There shouldn't be any mistake, right?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Smiling) I couldn't dare to be sure about that! Wait until I call her out, and you can recognize her for yourself. (Walks to the back door of the living room and calls out loudly.) Xiuzhen! Come quickly!</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Runs down the stairs, into the living room.) Auntie, what's the matter? (After just saying that, she sees Canyun, and seems afraid to recognize her.)</p>
<p>Canyun: (As soon as she sees Xiuzhen, she recognizes her immediately. She is extremely happy. She runs over, squats down, and hugs Xiuzhen.) Xiuzhen! Don't you recognize your mother anymore?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Confirms that it's her, and hugs Canyun's neck.)</p>
<p>Mom! Mom! Ah! Mom!</p>
<p>Canyun: Mom has been so worried about you! I never thought I would be able to find you.</p>
<p>(Mother and daughter are filled with happy tears. Mrs. Zheng is watching from the side, very touched, smiling but not saying anything.)</p>
<p>Canyun: Mrs. Zheng, I really don't know how to thank you enough. When you called just now, I really couldn't believe it. Now I can finally prove that it wasn't a dream. Can you tell me how you found Xiuzhen?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: I didn't find her. My younger sister brought her back from Guiyang.</p>
<p>Canyun: Where is your sister? Can you introduce me to her?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Of course. But she was feeling a bit unwell just now. Let me go and take a look.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Auntie, Mr. Zheng was crying upstairs just now.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Ah! (Exits the living room and goes upstairs.)</p>
<p>Canyun: (Asks Xiuzhen.) Which Mr. Zheng was crying?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: It's the Doctor Zheng who brought me back. I always call him Mr. Zheng.</p>
<p>Canyun: (Understands that Jingye is reluctant to return Xiuzhen.) Does she treat you well?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: She treats me very well. She loves me very much.</p>
<p>Canyun: Do you like her too?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I love her very much.</p>
<p>(The sound of someone coming down the stairs. Mrs. Zheng and Jingye enter the living room. Jingye looks a little reluctant, but she remains very calm and composed.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (To Canyun.) Mrs. He, this is my younger sister, Doctor Zheng Jingye.</p>
<p>Canyun: (Sees Jingye and is inexplicably surprised. She steps forward and shakes hands with Jingye.) Mr. Zheng.</p>
<p>Jingye: (Calmly, forcing a smile.) Mrs. He!</p>
<p>Canyun: Thank you for bringing Xiuzhen back. I don't know how to thank you enough.</p>
<p>Jingye: Mrs. He, you don't need to say that. "Helping others is the source of happiness." I unintentionally helped you find your daughter, which is also a happy thing for me. As for how I found Xiuzhen, I think she can tell you slowly.</p>
<p>Canyun: (Feels a little strange, not knowing what to do, it's hard to speak.) Mr. Zheng, we said in the newspaper that we would send a reward. Now I have prepared a check for 20 million yuan. I hope you will accept it. (Opens her handbag and takes out the check.)</p>
<p>Jingye: (Reveals a slight displeasure.) Mrs. He, please don't do that. When I took her in, it was entirely out of pity and love for her. I had no other purpose. Today, I am returning her to you, so that you and your daughter can be reunited. It is definitely not for the sake of a reward.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Mom, Mr. Zheng doesn't want money.</p>
<p>Canyun: How can that make me feel at ease?</p>
<p>Jingye: You don't need to think that way. If you want, you can take Xiuzhen back now. We can talk slowly later.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Xiuzhen still has a lot of clothes here. We will send them to your house tomorrow.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Suddenly runs from her mother's side to hug Jingye.) Mr. Zheng, let's go home together. If you don't go, I won't go either. (Starts to cry.)</p>
<p>Jingye: (Caresses her lovingly.) Silly child, that's your home, this is my home. How can I go with you? (Starts to tear up after saying that.)</p>
<p>(Canyun and Mrs. Zheng are watching from the side, and they also feel sad.)</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: If you don't go with me, I won't go - I won't go! (Cries.)</p>
<p>Jingye: (Also cries.) No, Xiuzhen, don't be like this. You go back first. I'll come and see you often in the future, okay? If you don't listen, I won't come to see you in the future.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (With tears in her eyes, nods.) Okay, okay, I'll listen.</p>
<p>Jingye: Okay, then go back with Mom first. (Pushes her to her mother's side. Canyun pulls Xiuzhen.)</p>
<p>Canyun: Mr. Zheng, I feel really bad for making you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Jingye: It's nothing.</p>
<p>Canyun: Then we'll leave now, and come to see you again tomorrow. (Everyone walks to the door together without saying a word.)</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: (Bows to Jingye.) Goodbye! Mr. Zheng! (Bows to Mrs. Zheng.) Goodbye! Zheng Auntie!</p>
<p>Jingye: Mrs. Zheng: Goodbye: Xiuzhen!</p>
<p>(After Canyun and her daughter leave, Jingye and Mrs. Zheng return to the living room. At this moment, Jingye can no longer control her emotions, and she starts to cry loudly. Mrs. Zheng comforts her.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Little sister, don't be like this. Of course children are lovely, but they are always someone else's. You can still see her often in the future.</p>
<p>Jingye: Sister-in-law, you don't know how much I love this child. [To be continued]</p>
<h3>Xiao Yinghui Fen's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wu Jingheng</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, I founded a specialized art school in my hometown of Liangxi. At that time, famous artists, such as Hu Tinglu and He Tianjian, all helped and taught, cultivating many talented artists. Xiao Yinghui was intelligent and diligent in her studies, and she was especially outstanding at the time. Xiao Yinghui has been away from the school for twenty years, traveling all over the country, engaging in sketching, and studying the works of previous masters, so her attainments have become even deeper. Now, at the request of people in Shanghai, she is exhibiting her recent works at the China Art Garden for seven days starting from February 21st. I usually don't like to write articles to promote people, but Xiao Yinghui is indeed the real deal. I dare to tell those who love art. Written by Wu Jingheng at the age of eighty-four, in the Six-One-Eight Hut.</p>

<h3>Scattered Notes by Ta Gong</h3>
<p>— Ta</p>
<p>Words for the Chrysanthemum Longevity Gathering</p>
<p>The "Words for the Chrysanthemum Longevity Gathering" were written by Yao Zhixiang (Huidi) of Huixian, Henan, and published in the year of Ji Si during the reign of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty. Mr. Wu Pingqi (Yun) did the calligraphy. Yao and Wu were related through marriage. The collection of words consists of four volumes, of which only one selection from the Futang Leirong Selection is seen, without anyone having glimpsed the whole picture. Recently, the original edition was found, with a preface by Yao Meibo and a postscript by Jiang Jianren, both praising it to the highest degree. Here are a few excerpts for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts of ci poetry.</p>
<p>One, Ode to the Autumn Colors of Shiyuan Garden</p>
<p>East of the orchid, I love the returning yellow turning green; autumn resides in the fine silk of Liu. Watching the irrigation of the rainbow silk, the sunset shines like phoenix brocade, cutting the colorful silk, still recognizing the Sui Palace. Able to bear the beautiful charm of the frost goddess, how many colors there are, learning from the red maples; the ground is covered with cold dew, a new goose in the sky, urging the dyeing of sorrowful red. Facing these seven-foot-long fragrant branches, remembering the coral being shattered, the Jin Valley empty. The crimson trees convey songs, the cinnabar transforms bones, the cold beauty does not borrow the spring's labor. Do not ask about news from Yumen Pass, leaning on the remaining drunkenness, sleeves dancing in the west wind; wanting to write a secluded feeling to send far away, it's hard to fill the postbox.</p>
<p>A Tune of "Wind in the Pines" for Western Wine</p>
<p>The rich drops of pearl are concentrated in the small wine vat, autumn brewing with dewy fragrance; who passed on the brewing method from France? Reaching the vast sea, ten thousand miles of ladders and voyages. (Western wine from France is considered the best.) A single reed carries the precious vessel, a thousand flowers produce immortal nectar. The glass reflects the purple glow, a light buzz is already a delightful homecoming, rare flowers and precious fruits are searched and gathered, (this wine is made by mixing flowers and fruits) like bees diligently collecting honeyed pollen; willing to offer ten bushels of grapes, not envying the marquisate of the Western Liang.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Linye</p>
<p>— A Popular Story from Annam</p>
<p>The pitch-black sky suddenly cracked open, and a snow-white ray of light pierced through it. Moving clouds slid past in front of the light, and gradually a round moon peeked out. ...</p>
<p>"What a beautiful moon!" Old Man Wen said with a sense of emotion, stroking his foot-long beard and straightening his chest as he looked up.</p>
<p>At that moment, a commotion of sounds came from not far away, mixed with the clatter of wooden boards: a group of children came up, all carrying many things: long benches, canvas folding stools, toys they couldn't bear to let go of.... Old Man Wen smiled and turned his face. Soon everyone had surrounded him.</p>
<p>The children clamored for Old Man Wen to tell a story. He also set a condition that everyone should sing a song first. After some back-and-forth, four or five of the more generous children clapped their hands and began to sing:</p>
<p>"The sun shines bright, on the earth, on the pond, on the thirtieth night of the year, picking betel nuts, betel nuts fragrant, picking purple ginger, purple ginger spicy, picking radishes, radishes sweet; alas, the radish harvest is not complete, half the fields have suffered disaster; I wonder when the war will end, and we can live in peace and enjoy the New Year? ..."</p>
<p>The singing stopped. Old Man Wen pondered for a moment, then slowly stood up from his chair and moved the stool slightly towards a large tree. A story had already formed in his head. In the past few days, he had been telling war stories, like the Three Kingdoms vying for dominance, and Yue Fei fighting the Jin soldiers. But today he wanted to change things up a bit. But no matter how he changed it, everyone was happy to listen.</p>
<p>——Long, long ago, there were two brothers who lived with their mother in a small seaside village in Fujian. Because they had no father, they relied solely on their two hands, using their labor to support their mother. The older brother was called Lao Da, and the younger brother was called Lao Er. Because they grew up in poverty, they developed a kind of filial piety. Lao Da had always been ambitious. He hoped that one day he could become a rich man and let his mother spend her old age in comfort....</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and Lao Da had grown into a twenty-year-old youth. He had rosy skin, beautiful eyes, and hair, and he could sing beautiful mountain songs.... One day, he quietly discussed it with Lao Er. He hoped to go to a foreign land to do business with a seagoing ship, but Lao Er could only sympathize and could not help him.</p>
<p>Lao Da finally pleaded with his mother:</p>
<p>"Mom, let me go. At most half a year, and I'll bring back something you like...."</p>
<p>Lao Da finally packed his bags and prepared to board the ship. In his bundle were some clothes and dry provisions. His kind mother also gave him all her hard-earned savings over the years as travel expenses. On the morning of his departure, everyone cried and saw him off with tears. Lao Da carefully handed over the responsibility of caring for their old mother to the young Lao Er, and set off on the long journey with a heart full of hope.</p>
<p>After ten days at sea, Lao Da was finally brought to a land where he was unfamiliar with the people and the place—this was Annam. The lush green trees, the sweet tropical fruits, and the flat fields enchanted Lao Da. He thought that his hopes could be realized immediately.</p>
<h3>Recent World Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>When Hitler was in power, no one would have thought that the old German literary giant Hauptmann would be accustomed to living under the Nazis. No one would have expected that Hauptmann would support Hitler's policies when he withdrew from the League of Nations. He spoke to Germans abroad in short broadcasts. No one would have thought that the person who challenged Kaiser in his youth would feel that this was the greatest period of his life when he shook hands with the Nazi Party.</p>
<p>Even conservatives attacked Hitler's anti-Semitism, but Hauptmann remained silent. In fact, with his status and age, he would not have been in mortal danger even if he had said a few words for the Jews. Did he forget that some Jewish actors, directors, and critics had helped him become "the German Ibsen" and "the German Shakespeare" in the realm of art? Hauptmann did not become a fascist like the Norwegian Nobel laureate Hamsun, but he did stain his life.</p>
<p>Waller Reichart, a German professor at the University of Michigan, recently wrote an introduction to Hauptmann's five-act play "The Obstacles" (Die Internisse). The script is written in German, but the introduction is written in English. He is an expert on Hauptmann and has tried his best to clear Hauptmann's name, but he cannot convince readers.</p>
<p>Wharton's Biography</p>
<p>Percy Lubbock has recently published "Portrait of Edith Wharton." This book is neither more nor less than the title indicates, and within its narrow limits, it is the most complete work of the last ten years. This is not a true biography, nor is it literary criticism. It is a portrait of a famous writer, a method commonly used in the eighteenth century that has reappeared today.</p>
<p>Lubbock says that Wharton was a sophisticated American who could see the struggle between materialism and idealism in the United States in the second half of the nineteenth century. She was also a highly skilled writer of her time, comparable to the female writer Caesar. She was greatly influenced by Henry James. Her standards are high, and she can capture countless readers of women's magazines.</p>
<p>He is a good friend of Wharton, and his success is that he wrote about her as a woman, not as a writer. The book also intersperses anecdotes about other friends and mentions that she built many houses and gardens in Lenot and northern France. She was a daughter of a wealthy family. When she was not writing, she grew flowers or talked. The flowers were grown for friends to see, and the words were shared with friends.</p>
<p>The book even writes about Wharton's habits of often being shy, shrugging her shoulders, and snoring. Lubbock is not very satisfied with Walter Berry, Wharton's lifelong lover. Berry is an American international lawyer.</p>
<p>The book records many of Wharton's conversations. Because she was talkative, she could talk about books, art, life, philosophy, etc., without any reservations.</p>

<h3>The Chinese and Books</h3>
<p>— Zeshi</p>
<p>If the cultural level of a country can be measured by the number of books it publishes, then China, this ancient cultural nation, is in danger of being included in the list of the least cultural nations today. Generally speaking, the reason why Chinese people read so little is because of poverty and high illiteracy rates. This is naturally one explanation, but I secretly think that it is not entirely true. China has four or five hundred million people, and one in ten of them is comparable to the population of England. Is it possible that every Englishman is rich and highly educated, while one in ten Chinese is still penniless and illiterate? And the ratio of published books and the number of reading people in China and England is still far greater, without a doubt.</p>
<p>This is because Chinese people do not like to read, which is a sign of a lack of thirst for knowledge. Several months ago, I witnessed a debate between two friends, A and B, about whether buying books or buying white leather shoes was right or wrong. It turned out that on that day, friend A spent 80,000 yuan to buy an old Western book, while friend B spent 160,000 yuan to buy a new pair of white leather shoes. A said that the book was really cheap, but B scoffed at him, saying that it was really "suffering a wrongful death" to spend so much money on an old book. A retorted, saying that it was simply a waste to spend 160,000 yuan on a pair of white leather shoes. B said that shoes are a necessity, and books cannot satisfy hunger. A said that there is no need to distinguish between black and white for leather shoes, and that wearing leather shoes at all is foolish, as they are heavy to walk in and make a "gong, gong" sound, and if you live upstairs, you will definitely be hated by your downstairs neighbors. To want white ones and black ones is even more absurd, while books can increase knowledge, broaden horizons, borrow friends, pass on to descendants...</p>
<p>Although friend A likes to buy books, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, he buys three to five volumes every month, but he has never been poorly clothed or underfed because of it. His income is not more than friend B's, and his family burden is roughly the same. I once asked him where the money for buying books came from. He said, "It's very easy. There are expenses that are absolutely unavoidable in people's daily use of money, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt. There are expenses that are absolutely avoidable, such as gambling and prostitution. There are expenses that can be avoided or not avoided, such as cigarettes and alcohol, such as rickshaws and cars, such as first-run movies and first-class barbershops, and even friend B's white leather shoes, which are too numerous to mention. My money for buying books comes from saving on items that can be avoided or not avoided. For example, if you smoke White Tip cigarettes, why not switch to Red Tip cigarettes, or switch to four times a month, saving some money to buy a book. If you ride a rickshaw, switch to a streetcar. If you are used to watching first-run movies, switch to watching last-run movies or not watching them several times, and so on. Such savings do not damage a hair, and the money for buying books is more than enough."</p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense. Persuading people to save on things that cannot be saved or reduce food that cannot be reduced to buy books may be forcing people to do something difficult and unreasonable, but not buying a pair of white leather shoes, which are only for temporary use, to buy books should be a matter of course and should not be criticized. But my friend B, who bought white leather shoes, is still a customer of the bookstore, because he certainly does not wear white leather shoes every day, and he has never failed to buy and read books. What is even more extreme is that I also know many people who are definitely not illiterate and have ample "disposable funds" to buy books, but they never buy a book all year round. Their rooms are full of refrigerators, electric fans, mahjong tiles, and poker cards, but not a single page of white paper printed with black words.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must investigate why books must be bought and read. The saying that there are golden houses and beautiful women in books is certainly a thing of the past and has become empty talk. Understanding what Plato said, what Marx said, whether American democracy is short, or Soviet democracy is long, practically speaking, what is the benefit after all? However, for Chinese people, the greatest benefit of reading is that only by reading can they clear the golden houses in their hearts and sweep away the beautiful women in their eyes. Because what many Chinese people today cherish and are influenced by is lottery tickets and women, their highest ideals are to live in a golden house with a beautiful woman, and to sleep in a coffin made of nanmu wood and have a state funeral after death. This is also a matter of human nature, and I dare not criticize it. The problem is that the world is not yet at the point where everyone has a machine—a machine for printing lottery tickets—so if everyone wants to live in a golden house with a beautiful woman and sleep in a coffin made of nanmu wood and have a state funeral, the result will inevitably be rampant desires, with people robbing each other and no longer having any moral principles. How to reverse this tide, I think reading more books is also a method. Books, except for prostitution manuals and gambling guides, are all talks about the past and present that do not involve one's own interests, such as how to build an ideal country, how Utopia succeeds, how commendable Washington's resignation is, how valuable Pasteur's research on rabies is, allowing you to read and think about things outside of yourself, even if you are still shocked by the soaring price of rice, you will still be affected by some subtle influences and will not, like those who do not read a book all year round and have not gone beyond their immediate interests, inevitably think only of money, money, money, and even be driven solely by profit. Because if we live in this world without borrowing a few things such as music, painting, sculpture, sports, books, sleep, etc., to allow us to transcend the material world and roam the void, then what we hear and see all day long will be nothing but dazzling material things, and how can we avoid being blinded by profit!</p>
<p>If someone says that if everyone reads books for the sake of fantasy as you said, wouldn't there be a risk of everyone becoming a "bookworm"? Then I would answer that if there were two countries in the world, one a bookworm country and the other a money-grubbing country, then I would sincerely be willing to renounce my citizenship in the money-grubbing country and become a citizen of the bookworm country.</p>
<h3>Five Jiao and Four Fen Per Grain of Rice</h3>
<p>— Yang Wenyu</p>
<p>After the abolition of the lunar year, the price of rice first soared, breaking through the two million mark. According to a time-consuming statistical result from a relative of the author, calculated at two million yuan per dan, each grain of rice is already worth 5 jiao and 4 fen in legal currency. This is how he obtained the result: There are about 1,500 whole grains of white rice per liang, 15 jin and 7 liang of rice per dou, so there are 370,000 grains, and one dan of rice has 3.7 million grains. Therefore, when rice sells for 3.7 million yuan per dan, it is "one yuan per grain of rice." Buying rice will have to be calculated by the grain, and I'm afraid it will soon become a reality. At the same time, this relative tried it more than ten times, spitting out a mouthful of rice without chewing and counting it. He said that an adult's mouthful of rice has about 360 grains. Calculated at 5 jiao and 4 fen per grain of rice, it now costs about 140 yuan to eat a mouthful of rice. Comparing it to the situation ten years ago, one mouthful of rice now eats up two mu of farmland from the past.</p>
<h3>Eating (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Although there are many kinds of ancient bronze artifacts discovered by archaeologists, the most important are the tableware, that is, among the ritual vessels, those belonging to ancestral temples or shrines are still related to eating. Soup plates and Kong tripods are all legacies left to us by our ancestors because of eating. By examining the living conditions of the ancients through this, what is regrettable is that we still cannot know in detail what the process and taste of the ancients' pickled vegetables and cooking were like. In the past, I often wondered why the ancients, when recording merits and rewarding achievements, did not issue medals or the like as we do today, but instead cast tripods and engraved inscriptions. Now that I think about it, I realize that the problem of eating is originally the most important thing in the world. This action of the ancients is probably more meaningful than medals. Not only that, but the ancients used the harmony of the cauldron to symbolize the prime minister's profession. A good cook is a good prime minister. Every knife and spoon, adding salt and soy sauce, is no different from the so-called adjustment and allocation in politics. National chaos is called "the cauldron boils," and national stability is called "peaceful feasting," which all seem to be related to eating. In fact, it is true that as long as the problem of eating is solved, there will be no chaos. Therefore, those who plan for the country say: "Everyone must have food to eat." - Those who say "Everyone has food to eat" are referring to revolution, with the ultimate goal being "Everyone has food to eat."</p>
<p>What is expressed externally is "negotiating at the banquet table," which may as well start with small things, such as the Shanghai wastrel's "drinking tea to settle disputes." The greatest hatred can be resolved in a cup of tea and a meal, or it can lead to a break after three cups of wine. Who can say that eating has nothing to do with peace? It is the same between people and between countries. If you have read Zuo Zhuan, you will definitely remember those fellows who were sent to the four directions, who, after a banquet, recited two lines of poetry, and could immediately establish a non-aggression treaty or a friendship agreement between the two countries. Fan Sui and Xu Jia became bitter enemies because of eating, which even affected the rise and fall of the country. Feng Xuan played the zither and sang songs, also first picking on the food. Su Qin stimulated Zhang Yi by having him eat with the servants. Zhuan Zhu assassinated King Liao by taking advantage of the opportunity of a banquet. As for situations like the Feast at Hong Gate and strategies like "releasing military power with a cup of wine," they are even more common in China. How many "throwing cups as a signal" and how many "ambushes of ax-wielding men on both sides" are there in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms? It can be seen that not only did Marquis of Huaiyin cherish the kindness of a meal, but the hatred of a meal is also not a trivial matter!</p>
<p>In folk customs, there is the eating of seasonal festivals. The object of Chinese festivals is often gods and Buddhas, and the enjoyment of festivals is eating. The old lunar year is currently being celebrated, which is the day of the great culmination of eating in the 360 days of the year. Yesterday, my child suddenly realized that "Isn't the reason why people celebrate festivals the day when pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish are unlucky?" Although childish, it is profoundly true. On New Year's Eve, meat has become expensive at 50,000 yuan per jin, but the vegetable market is still crowded! Demand exceeds supply, and foreign countries only eat a turkey for Christmas, and the whole country is ecstatic. How many kinds of food do we eat for the New Year? If we investigate and count them in all the provinces, cities, and counties of the country, we will definitely be able to write a book of several hundred pages. The Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival must be a big feast, which need not be discussed. Even small seasonal festivals, such as the Beginning of Spring, the Beginning of Winter, the Winter Solstice, the Summer Solstice, entering the Fu period, leaving the Fu period, the Lantern Festival, the Upper Lantern, the Lower Lantern, ... are all represented by eating. In eating, there must also be the meaning of getting rich. In the north, eating boiled dumplings during the New Year symbolizes ingots. In the south, the stove sugar is basically made in the shape of ingots, called ingot sugar. In peaceful times, we eat New Year's Eve dinner in the twelfth lunar month and spring wine in the first lunar month. The so-called "wheel meeting" in the north is even more lively, and there are many more auspicious words. Books that record customs, from Jingchu Sui Shi Ji to Tokyo Menghua Lu and Wulin Old Stories, all occupy a large amount of space on eating, which is rare in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Even stranger is the language. In the past, Mr. Liu Banchen wrote "Da Ya," specializing in the study of the use of the word "da," believing it to be the most difficult to understand and the most ambiguous in Chinese characters, jokingly calling it a "rogue word," because its explanation reached more than four hundred items. In fact, there are several words like this, and "chi" (eat) is probably the most common one: the use of "chi" in everyday language is endless. Special items such as "eat a defeat," "eat a living," "eat a loss," "eat a price," ... and there is also the saying of representing a certain occupation with "eat ×× rice," such as saying: eat self-government, eat charity, eat wastrel rice, which is even more wonderful and worth our "deep thought." I wonder if there is a scholar who will rise up and follow in the footsteps of Dr. Liu to write a "Chi Ya."</p>
<p>Recently, I saw many gentlemen and ladies on the train - especially the ladies, from the time the train started to the time they got off, eating fruits and snacks constantly, plus train meals, curry rice, and even meeting those selling buns, beef, and sesame cakes, they didn't let go. It is truly surprising how much they eat. Rich people in Guangdong can eat seven or eight meals a day, including snacks. For these people, their entire lives can probably be represented by eating. No wonder everyone always says "Have you had snacks?" "Have you had dinner?" when they meet. In the past, being scolded as a rice bucket would definitely lead to anger, but at the moment, wanting to genuinely be a rice bucket is not easy when the price of rice is over two million. However, wanting to be worthy of this scolding is exactly what they are looking for! On the other hand, the ancients often minced the other party and fried them in oil. Now that I think about it, is it also because of famine and food scarcity? When Huang Chao entered Chang'an, human flesh was valued by the pound, which is both terrible and pitiful. As for Ma Shumou's hobby of eating people, it is another matter, and in today's world, the so-called torrent of people is everywhere.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: A Bellyful of Doubts, Seven Nine</p>
<p>Aunt Wang smiled and said, "Mr. Xu, go upstairs, I've already told the boss about last night. She's asking you to go up." As soon as Zhu Zhai heard Aunt Wang say this, he felt very excited. When he reached the top of the stairs, just as he lifted the curtain to enter Qi Huan's bedroom, he heard Qi Huan ask from inside, "Who is it? Is it Zhu Zhai? Please wait a moment." As soon as Zhu Zhai heard this, he immediately retracted his steps, turned around, and retreated to the outer living room. He couldn't help but feel a kind of embarrassing impression, because normally in Qi Huan's house, he would walk in and out without hindrance. No matter where Qi Huan was, they wouldn't stand on ceremony with each other and could walk in at will. Today, she was in the bedroom and actually stopped him from entering. Normally she would just call him "Zhu! Zhu!" but today she called him Zhu Zhai. Such a way of addressing him, such an action, clearly showed distance. He withdrew from the bedroom, feeling very sad in his heart. With all the impressions he had gained today, in a fit of anger, he really wanted to go back and ignore her. In the living room, with his hands in his trouser pockets, he paced around the table, his heart full of anger and resentment. He walked around several circles before Aunt Wang pushed the door open and came in, smiling and saying, "The boss is asking for you." Zhu Zhai, filled with anger, asked Aunt Wang, "Don't walk to the door again and chase me out." Aunt Wang laughed and said, "What are you angry about, my dear sir! People are waiting for you! Go quickly, and be a little nicer when you see her. I've already told her how you went out to look for her last night. She even shed tears when she heard it!" As soon as Zhu Zhai heard that Qi Huan had shed tears, all the anger and resentment in his heart disappeared. He said, "I'm not angry," and followed Aunt Wang straight to Qi Huan's bedroom. He saw her lying on the bed, facing inward, covered with a red satin quilt. Zhu Zhai, following his usual habit, sat down on the edge of the bed and placed one hand on the quilt, asking, "Were you tired last night? Are you feeling unwell?" These two sentences were originally just a casual inquiry from Zhu Zhai, but Qi Huan found them very刺耳, as if Zhu Qi was mocking her. When she heard what Aunt Wang had told her, she felt very sad in her heart. All kinds of feelings made her shed tears involuntarily. Now, unintentionally, Zhu Zhai asked her, "Were you tired last night?" She immediately felt that men's hearts were cruel and could say anything. She coldly replied, "Not tired!" Zhu Zhai asked again, "Where did you go last night? I didn't come back all night, I was really worried." Qi Huan replied coldly again, "I'm not a child, what's there to be afraid of!" Zhu Zhai was stunned by the two snubs.</p>
<h3>The Definition of a Child</h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>What is a child? A child is a bank in which you can store your most precious treasures—such as: your hard-earned wisdom, your dreams of making the world a better place. Your children will preserve these treasures, and they may even make good use of these treasures and receive considerable interest.</p>
<p>How well you have done your work will be judged by today's children. Tomorrow, he will replace you. The "future" belongs to children, and if you can pay more attention to him today, then the "future" may still have a place for you to stand.</p>
<h3>Commercial Ethics</h3>
<p>— Sent from the Desert</p>
<p>In a certain English publication published in this city, I read an unsigned article by a certain gentleman, which was quite critical of international trade since the victory. This article also cited several "interesting" examples.</p>
<p>In June 1946, someone ordered 11,064 pairs of men's and women's leather shoes from a store in New York, worth US$52,500. The goods arrived in Shanghai in batches between July and August of the same year. The sizes, styles, and colors were all inconsistent with those specified in the samples and orders, and some of the leather shoes even had "samples" from more than a decade ago mixed in. What was even more frustrating after an investigation of this transaction was that the New York exporter had just been released from a reformatory!</p>
<p>Similar to the above incident, there was also an order for 10,000 black melton overcoat fabrics worth US$70,000, and 6,000 yards of tweed worth US$40,000. Initially, the importer specified only twelve types of tweed patterns. However, after the goods arrived in Shanghai and were opened, there were actually one hundred and ninety different colors and patterns. The situation with the melton overcoat fabrics was even worse, with some being serge, some being thick wool, and some being camel hair. It is said that this was a batch of odds and ends of wool fabrics, but they were all dyed black.</p>
<p>Another example is that someone ordered 15,000 fluorescent lamps from a New York exporter in April 1946. The goods arrived in full within three months, but the materials were of poor quality, the manufacturing was shoddy, and they were unusable. The final result of sending them to the power company for inspection was that they were not only considered waste but also posed a great danger when used.</p>
<p>In addition, a local merchant who ordered woolen hats and woolen underwear from a New York exporter also complained incessantly. It turned out that the brims of the imported woolen hats were too narrow to be suitable for the market, and the sizes were either too large or too small. Although the woolen underwear was made entirely of wool, it was old clothing that had been worn once or several times.</p>
<p>A relatively mild situation was that a certain merchant ordered a batch of "Santa Knight" mandarin oranges from San Francisco, which were indeed produced in California, but they were much smaller than those sold on the market, so they had to be sold at a reduced price.</p>
<p>Here, we can regard these things as "anecdotes" in the history of international trade. However, there are countless acts that disregard commercial ethics. For example, a whole box of soap will be short one or two bars, the bottom of a tin of biscuits is actually a large wad of paper and biscuit crumbs, assorted candies have a bitter taste, and "high-quality" silk stockings tear into a hole after being worn for a day. Originally, industry and commerce aim to make profits, which is understandable, but we believe that both Chinese and foreign merchants should at least strive for "genuine goods at fair prices"!</p>
<h3>Radar</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>According to recent test results, magnesium flash bulbs used for photography within a radius of approximately 250 feet around radar may explode due to the influence of the radar, or even catch fire. Therefore, American aircraft equipped with radar are no longer allowed to carry such light bulbs.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Puppet Emperor Because of the Fire at the False "Palace"</h3>
<p>— Lei Yuan</p>
<p>Upon seeing the news from Changchun, it was reported that more than a hundred buildings of the former Puppet Manchu Palace, which were converted into a school after the restoration, were destroyed by a fire, reduced to ashes. The traces of a puppet regime have vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>In the summer of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, Puyi was still living in the Forbidden City in Beiping. One night, a sudden fire broke out in the palace, shocking the city. The fire was finally extinguished, but the losses were enormous. In my work "Twelve Verses of Summer Awakening in Guihai" (published in the Beijing News and the Shanghai Times), the fifth verse is about this event: "Living at home, breaking through the heavens, what an unexpected end. For ten years, Shenzhou watched with folded hands. Flaming torches soar into the sky, startling ten thousand households. Officials gather in the Forbidden City in the deep of night. Where is the spirit of the White Mountains and Black Water? The traces of the stopped magpie and rising dragon are already gone. Reviving the country and setting fire to the plains are the same instrument, so hold back your tears and don't shed them lightly." Many people responded in verse, and Gu Youyi of Taizhou wrote: "Who knows that a single torch is not a blessing, and a ten-year plan is an abandoned ruin!" He advocated optimism for the emperor, with a novel idea and an alert expression, which was indeed reasonable.</p>
<p>Puyi ascended the throne at the age of three and abdicated at the age of six, without enjoying the blessing of "Ninth Five". He never held the power of a true monarch, living in seclusion in the deep palace, surrounded by eunuchs, palace concubines, and Qing loyalists. His situation became increasingly difficult, but he still had to maintain the pomp of an emperor. Although there were many supporters, they were all looking at the imperial property in the palace. In addition to "rewards" and "salaries" that benefited those above and below, if they were not satisfied, they would secretly steal and replace things. They knew that this young emperor's authority did not extend beyond the palace, and the eunuchs and others became even more unscrupulous. It is said that the disaster of Guihai was caused by too much theft, which could not be concealed, so they set a fire to quickly destroy the traces. The corruption and depravity of the situation were indescribable. Puyi received the worship of a group of extremely bored people and had to use his ancestral property to support them month after month. The puppet career was not much different from the puppet emperor of "Manchukuo." However, he himself was in his youth and had a foreign doctor teach him, so he was approaching modern thought. If he could use this fire to awaken from his delusions, break free from his noble cage, and transform into a new life, it would not be a lost opportunity, as the saying goes, "A loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise." Mr. Gu's poetic intent was truly one of cold observation and a warm heart, deeply considering the future for this "child emperor."</p>
<p>However, he was ultimately just a "child," a weakling being manipulated, without decision-making power or freedom. In the winter of the following year (the thirteenth year of the Republic of China), Feng Yuxiang revolted against "Cao" (Kun) and顺加演"forced the abdication", driving Puyi and the old imperial family out of the Forbidden City and turning them into relatively ordinary residents in Tianjin. Some people advised him to study abroad, completely free himself from the old shackles, and strive to become a practical and capable young man, representing his clan and serving China, which was another good opportunity.</p>
<p>However, a group of corrupt and inferior "subjects" did not let go, and the Japanese "looked at the grass and saw the hawk's eyes were sharp", seeing him as a "rare commodity" and protecting him in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, calling it the "imperial court." Japanese officials and businessmen treated him with the courtesy of a monarch, and the Qing loyalists continued to pay respects and submit memorials according to the old rituals, deceiving themselves and others, and claiming to be alone and orphaned. This went on for eight years, missing all opportunities for studying abroad and starting a new life. When the "September 18th Incident" occurred, Doihara rushed to Tianjin, coaxing and threatening him, first moving him to Dalian and then to Changchun. He first taught him to be the "Chief Executive" and then promoted him to be the "Emperor", with the reign titles first "Datong" and then "Kangde", changing morning and evening, neither fish nor fowl. Furthermore, he was not allowed to resume the name "Great Qing" nor to return to the old capital of three hundred years ago (Fengtian), but was designated to Changchun and made a puppet for fourteen years, neither crying nor laughing, being "pulled by strings" and "making clothes for others." It is fitting that after the victory, when Puyi was escorted to Tokyo, Japan to testify against Japanese criminals, he recounted the experience, angrily shouting and even pounding the table. When the "bandit" (i.e., "Doihara") was about to flee, Puyi's entourage negotiated with him, and there were considerable conditions. The "bandit" readily agreed, but when they arrived in Dalian and entered their sphere of influence, the situation changed. Puyi had a sense of this and hesitated to proceed, lingering for several months, but ultimately could not resist the coercion and followed him east. In the beginning of the establishment of the puppet organization, there was still some semblance of dignity, but soon the ruse was exposed, and everything was controlled by the Japanese. The ministries had Japanese "Vice Ministers" but the "Ministers" were mere companions, and the courts had Japanese "Chief Secretaries" while the "Premiers" simply nodded in agreement. Puyi was not allowed to interfere in political affairs, and even the "palace" was gradually interfered with. He had no freedom in personnel and expenses.</p>
<p>Puyi claimed to be the "Chief Executive", imitating Duan Qirui of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China. His advancement to emperor and the establishment of the reign title "Kangde" alluded to "Kangxi" of the early Qing dynasty, and he modeled himself after Yuan Shikai of the fifth year of the Republic of China, using "Hongxian" to allude to "Hongwu" of the early Ming dynasty. Furthermore, the former Qing dynasty and Japan had a "cabinet" under the emperor, but the puppet "Manchukuo" could only be called the "Prime Minister of the State Council". Also, both Japan and the former Qing dynasty had a so-called "responsible cabinet", where the monarch was not responsible for political affairs, but in puppet "Manchukuo", not only did the puppet emperor have no power, but even the puppet prime minister (first Zheng Xiaoxu and then Zhang Jinghui) held a nominal position, while everything was directed by the Japanese in the General Affairs Office. Thus, a "office system" was created outside the "cabinet system", which was unheard of in the world and truly a joke.</p>
<p>After Puyi was a puppet for fourteen years, for the last three years, he was a prisoner of war. The glory of the past puppet was still considered the old home of the White Mountains and Black Water, but the life of a prisoner of war was spent wandering in Soviet territory, with no relatives to turn to. When reading history, we see the suffering of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Song Dynasty being captured by the Jin, detained in the Five Kingdoms City, and at the end of the Jin dynasty, the Jin emperor was forced by the Mongols to flee to Caizhou, arriving at Shuanggu Temple, with wormwood everywhere. Their concubines were escorted to Helin, and the historical record states, "The journey was full of hardships, even worse than the time of Huizong and Qinzong." Therefore, the situation of Puyi from Changchun to Vladivostok to Moscow can be imagined. He never enjoyed a day of real power and tasted the suffering of a monarch of a fallen country, because he had never escaped the nature of being a "rare commodity" from the beginning. He was misled by corrupt officials and harmed by the Japanese, losing the opportunity for freedom twice in twenty years. It was his fate!</p>

<h3>Postal Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>We have received letters from (1) Mr. Wu of Taiyuan Road in this city, (2) Mr. Liu Hongzhi of Yichang, and (3) Mr. Zhang Yueqiu of the Air Force Command in this city, inquiring about various points. We will briefly answer them as follows:</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) (A) The market near Taiyuan Road in this city is sluggish, and there is currently no need to set up a postal kiosk. (B) This Bureau has approved Lichang Store at No. 83 Yongkang Road (at the intersection of Xiangyang South Road) as a postal agency. It is currently being planned, and once established, it will be more convenient for the public near Taiyuan Road to mail letters. (C) There is a postal mailbox at the intersection of Taiyuan Road and Yongkang Road, and a stamp vending point will also be added near the mailbox in the near future.</p>
<p>(2) (A) Airmail between Shanghai and Yichang is sent via Hankou. Aircraft are used for transportation between Shanghai and Hankou, and ships are used for transportation between Hankou and Yichang. If there is a delay in incoming and outgoing mail, please send the original envelope to the original sending post office for thorough investigation. (B) This Bureau is unable to provide its own aircraft for transporting mail due to financial difficulties. As for whether civil aviation aircraft can land at Yichang Airport, this is an aviation matter and cannot be answered.</p>
<p>(3) Ordinary letters sent to Lingling, Hunan by land and water routes will take about fourteen or fifteen days to arrive. Letters sent by air will arrive in about six or seven days.</p>
<h3>Tuition and Fees· Heavy Burden, Sell Old Books· Seek Compensation</h3>
<p>Editor: Current prices are soaring, and I am deeply worried about the various expenses for the next semester. Therefore, I would like to transfer more than 30 copies of my university business courses for the first and second years and high school textbooks to others to compensate for the expenses. Those who are willing (regardless of the number) can send a letter with postage to No. 297 Fanwangdu Road, and I will send the catalog. I would be grateful if you could borrow a corner of your newspaper! Respectfully submitted by student Chen Zhongming</p>
